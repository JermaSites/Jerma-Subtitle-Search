[01:27.71]You realize that's what you guys all do, right?
[01:29.56]We all do that.
[01:32.60]Here's a little, let's talk about a social experiment.
[01:36.69]When you feel like it next time, just record the whole room.
[01:41.54]If you're playing a game or sitting there watching TV, just get a mic set up and just hit record.
[01:48.18]For like an hour.
[01:49.42]Or you know, like two days.
[01:51.08]And just forget about it.
[01:52.60]And then go back and listen to like day two because you've forgotten about it.
[01:58.30]Guarantee you're going to be going like this.
[02:12.04]Maybe not that extreme, but... You know.
[02:18.86]It would be horrible to go back and listen to.
[02:20.33]I bet it would be.
[02:24.13]Just give me a minute.
[02:24.57]We're going to do Monster Rancher 2 one more day.
[02:28.75]There's a lot of new games coming out here.
[02:30.99]There's a lot of stuff that is recently releasing.
[02:36.47]that we're gonna take a break from breeding monsters.
[02:44.62]We'll talk about it in a second.
[02:46.98]I'm just gonna make a tweet.
[02:48.38]See you in two seconds.
[04:21.72]Alrighty.
[04:23.10]I do apologize right off the bat here.
[04:25.94]Because I've got a very, very bad headache.
[04:29.34]I don't know why.
[04:30.30]I ate a chicken sandwich and I got an instant headache.
[04:35.11]How does that make any sense?
[04:37.41]What was in that?
[04:39.87]What headache juice did they put in there?
[04:41.21]I don't know.
[04:46.49]Anyways, let's look what I did.
[04:49.53]Hey, look what I did.
[04:51.63]Ready?
[04:53.81]Ah, come on.
[04:54.57]He's looking out for you guys in the chat room.
[04:57.39]He's heard all the shit you've been talking about the background music being terrible.
[05:01.67]Here we are.
[05:04.79]We're at the menu to correct that problem.
[05:09.92]You can't even hear it.
[05:12.54]Now you can.
[05:15.38]I think we get to pick the background sound.
[05:20.26]What?
[05:20.50]You don't want me to change it?
[05:23.16]Let's just see.
[05:23.68]Okay, we got background... Let's see what it is.
[05:26.40]Here's one.
[05:27.90]This is background music zero.
[05:31.10]How many are there?
[05:32.23]There are quite a lot.
[05:32.83]There are 50 background songs in this game?
[05:46.62]Dude, this is more than like the entire Pink Floyd anthology.
[05:50.24]Are you serious?
[05:56.63]No, they're all... No, this is like, no.
[06:07.64]Remember back in the day when you could test sounds?
[06:09.56]I guarantee there's going to be screams and stuff here too.
[06:11.28]Everybody watch this.
[06:15.65]Okay, I was like, what's going on here?
[06:16.89]That's the sound that I'm going up and down.
[06:19.99]There's two of them, apparently.
[06:21.44]How are these any different?
[06:23.32]Alright, take a guess.
[06:25.94]Are you ready, guys?
[06:26.82]Every single sound effect that's in the game is listed here.
[06:30.90]What do we got here?
[06:32.68]How many sounds are in Monster Rancher 2?
[06:36.16]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say 441.
[06:47.51]I'm gonna say $441.
[06:47.93]I want you guys to make sure you can look back and prove it to yourself.
[06:56.41]$442.
[06:56.49]Oh, fuck you.
[06:57.67]Don't prices right me here.
[07:02.60]If it's $500, then you just won the showcase.
[07:05.96]And that's bullshit.
[07:08.40]$441.
[07:08.42]Here we go.
[07:11.10]You know, let's listen to a few along the way.
[07:19.77]That's a good karate chop.
[07:20.55]Running water.
[07:21.05]Nice.
[07:21.15]Okay.
[07:21.25]Past 100.
[07:21.37]Ooh, that was a lion.
[07:21.85]That was somebody who fought it into audacity and slowed it down.
[07:49.87]I don't know what that, I don't know what that was.
[07:56.24]441, come on.
[07:56.58]Ooh, that's a good, like, shoot the laser sound.
[07:58.34]That's a, that's a barking dog.
[07:59.34]Two, almost to 300.
[08:19.02]Let's see, let's go with a few in a row here.
[08:28.79]Ow.
[08:32.99]That's a cat.
[08:34.63]That's also a cat.
[08:35.87]That's a cat.
[08:37.11]Okay, that's a cat opening its mouth, and this is the closing the mouth over the wet food sound, okay?
[08:51.78]There's a bird?
[08:53.04]Is there a bird in this game?
[08:57.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[08:58.17]I said 441.
[08:58.45]Come on.
[08:58.77]Hm?
[08:58.85]We're biting.
[08:59.35]This was no sound.
[09:00.07]Oh, there it was.
[09:00.59]It's like a monkey.
[09:01.17]There's a car alarm.
[09:20.63]Yeah, alright, fine.
[09:21.65]You want me to do the dead meme?
[09:23.31]Fine.
[09:24.41]Sure.
[09:26.07]Here's your dead meme.
[09:27.25]Let's see what it is.
[09:31.85]It's a ricochet.
[09:33.69]Alright, that's kinda cool.
[09:35.06]That's cool, I like that one.
[09:36.12]Three eighty four hundred and ten?
[09:37.14]That was just Tim Allen!
[09:49.55]Wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[09:51.39]Nobody fucking move.
[09:52.31]This is really important.
[09:53.83]I don't, hold on.
[09:54.67]We're going to play the whole entire Tim the Tool Man, Tim Allen song.
[10:00.79]And we're going to do that at the very end.
[10:02.19]This is important to me.
[10:06.35]I don't care what your fucking plan was for tonight, but hold on a minute.
[10:14.24]I'll make sure we can all hear this.
[10:20.11]What's the Tim the Tool Man?
[10:25.43]Home Improvement.
[10:26.12]Home Improvement Intro.
[10:30.90]Are you guys ready for this?
[10:34.40]Here we go.
[10:37.78]Here it comes.
[10:39.63]I remember listening to this.
[10:40.41]This was on like 4 o'clock in the morning.
[10:41.89]Every morning.
[10:42.37]It was awesome.
[10:45.99]Here it comes.
[10:51.08]Wait, wait, wait!
[11:08.86]Oh look, there's Jonathan Taylor Thomas!
[11:12.90]See if we can get it.
[11:25.29]I didn't get it.
[11:26.21]I couldn't get it.
[11:26.81]It's too hard.
[11:30.12]Oh, if I didn't have a fucking headache earlier.
[11:32.08]Okay, let's play Monster Rancher 2.
[11:43.08]That's what we were supposed to be doing.
[11:58.85]Oh.
[12:00.17]Okay, what, what, what are we doing?
[12:04.51]Does anyone remember what we were just doing?
[12:09.70]Oh yeah, we're at 441.
[12:10.38]Dammit.
[12:10.74]There's more than 441 sounds I lost.
[12:27.33]This is gonna be more than a thousand, right?
[12:32.53]I gotta turn this down.
[12:33.85]It's a little too loud.
[12:34.59]That was Yoshi.
[12:37.33]Yeah, it really was Yoshi.
[12:39.10]Fuck, is this what we're doing right now?
[12:40.82]That's just like a huff and puff.
[12:42.14]Wow, I can't believe there are this many sound effects.
[12:55.09]Now we're gonna go over 1500.
[12:55.77]Just go backwards?
[12:56.29]It's too late now.
[12:56.95]That's a mouse?
[12:57.55]These new subsounds?
[12:58.43]I should just change that.
[12:59.39]You want- Okay, you want to have my subsound finally changed?
[13:01.97]There it is.
[13:04.19]It's that shitty Tim the Toolman.
[13:05.77]Oh, man.
[13:05.93]We've come too far.
[13:06.53]We can't go back.
[13:30.49]I've heard that one already.
[13:35.13]I think that's actually our current monster's sound effect.
[13:38.85]It is.
[13:39.07]That one's worse.
[13:40.51]More than a thousand?
[13:41.13]Can I even count to a thousand?
[13:44.94]This is what happened when the new year Y2K happened?
[13:46.56]They were scared?
[13:59.34]Oh, shit.
[14:00.79]Oh, god damn it.
[14:02.73]This is going to be more sound effects than the viewers.
[14:06.37]Yeah, there probably will be.
[14:07.45]How many people are here right now?
[14:08.85]There are, what, just about 1,700 people here right now?
[14:10.35]There's a crowd.
[14:10.99]Alright, let's see if there are more than 1,739 people.
[14:12.71]Each one of you guys gets a sound.
[14:33.85]Wait, what?
[14:34.25]Whoa, whoa!
[14:34.77]Wait a minute!
[14:38.98]Ah, fuck you, Monster Rancher.
[14:40.24]I got way more viewers than you!
[14:41.80]1, 2, 3, 2?
[14:43.78]I had 1, 7, 3, 7?
[14:45.18]Not gonna embarrass me on my own stream.
[14:49.12]1, 2, 3, 2.
[15:02.71]It's just a loud P, yeah.
[15:09.23]Alright, let's go.
[15:11.57]That was fun.
[15:18.80]Go back to 4.10 and just- Alright, well, 4.10 is- No, we can't.
[15:22.24]It's too late.
[15:22.70]Look at this.
[15:23.00]It's gonna take too long.
[15:25.58]I'll get that as a sub song for a while.
[15:30.14]How's my CVVV?
[15:31.06]It's different today.
[15:33.64]my fucking head is screaming right now god damn it alright let's play 410 orion give me a break guys what is this play 985 or pre-recorded I'm not gonna you know how long that just took to do that
[15:57.84]You want me to sit there and hold the button?
[15:59.87]Fine, I'll do- I'm gonna find the people who have spoken.
[16:02.55]And by the people who have spoken, I mean like the eight people in chat that all just said that.
[16:05.61]Alright, I took- I took a little Tylenol already.
[16:09.98]And I'm dropping frames.
[16:14.54]My internet is currently dying.
[16:15.90]Glad we- glad we got like the best part of the stream done before the stream died from the internet.
[16:25.26]Nine, eight, five.
[16:33.43]That's it.
[16:37.75]That's pretty bad.
[16:41.51]Alright.
[16:46.11]Alright, now I'll play the Tim the Tatman.
[16:49.45]What am I saying?
[16:50.23]I'm saying like Tim the Tatman.
[16:52.58]Isn't he like a streamer?
[16:55.32]Man, remember when that live streamer had that, like, tool show?
[16:58.84]He had a bunch of kids.
[17:00.12]I can't believe I'm fucking doing this.
[17:21.20]He should change his name to Tim the Toolman one day and then dress up as Tim Allen and play that song.
[17:30.08]No, not 666.
[17:31.42]Oh my God, why are we doing this right now?
[17:38.74]And why is my internet dying?
[17:40.06]What if, give me a break.
[17:41.56]My internet's dying right now.
[17:46.21]There you go, there's the number of the beast.
[17:48.05]It's a pinball bumper.
[17:52.70]Alright, 410.
[17:53.30]You can hear it one more time.
[17:56.23]It actually is kind of good that I'm wasting time because I've dropped a thousand frames.
[17:59.99]So... I wonder if there's more than one... Tim Allen.
[18:01.81]This is worse than... Oh yeah, do 420.
[18:02.73]Of course, right?
[18:03.21]There you go.
[18:25.75]Wait, what was it?
[18:26.23]Four?
[18:26.77]I went by it.
[18:28.49]No, I didn't.
[18:28.91]It was 410.
[18:29.13]That's our new favorite sound in the world.
[18:39.50]God damn it.
[18:57.54]I am so happy that we got to experience that.
[19:00.14]Yep.
[19:04.91]Fucking Jesus.
[19:07.09]Alright, I turned, but here, the long story short here, what you should be realizing after that mess.
[19:14.05]What a mess.
[19:16.13]I turned the background music down.
[19:20.00]And I'm gonna, you know, like, it was up to 110.
[19:22.22]It's down to like, we'll put it at like 70, 80.
[19:24.56]You guys can handle that, right?
[19:32.17]I can't wait to hear that in the game.
[19:33.81]Some monster is going to have that move and we're going to lose our fucking minds.
[19:40.82]Just turn it off, not down.
[19:42.26]I'm not going to replace the background music with a repeat of 410.
[19:52.83]Sorry.
[19:56.89]That'll be fine.
[19:59.55]Turn the music off?
[20:00.61]No, and then it gets like weird because I'm just sitting there like, yeah.
[20:03.59]Hey guys.
[20:05.39]Yeah, how you doing?
[20:08.52]I like having a little bit of background.
[20:11.46]Replace it with royalty free?
[20:12.66]I can't.
[20:15.24]The way that I'm capturing the PlayStation 1, I can't have my desktop audio play at the same time as the PlayStation audio.
[20:25.04]It's coming through a strange couple of contraptions here.
[20:33.61]Which one was it?
[20:35.95]November 3rd or January 1st?
[20:38.45]No, it was January 1st.
[20:39.29]January 1st.
[20:44.18]Add more sources?
[20:45.06]It doesn't matter.
[20:47.04]I used to use virtual audio cables and then they broke.
[20:51.10]I used virtual audio cables for five years.
[20:57.92]Just do it with your phone speaker.
[21:00.78]No.
[21:01.82]I just actually humored that.
[21:03.16]I picked up my cell phone.
[21:04.06]I was like, oh yeah, you know what I can do.
[21:06.16]What was I thinking?
[21:11.10]So where we left off was with Lorax.
[21:18.55]I think it's this guy.
[21:19.75]I'm not kidding.
[21:21.27]I really think it's this guy.
[21:23.91]That's going to do the Home Improvement song.
[21:34.80]I'm gonna fucking shit my pants if he doesn't.
[21:44.37]Come on, man.
[21:46.07]Come on, please.
[21:47.29]I'm just waiting for... The music's not too loud.
[21:54.50]Alright, where... You just spit at me.
[22:01.96]Into the fucking fry later with you.
[22:05.03]It is too loud.
[22:10.82]Now the footsteps are too loud.
[22:17.10]It's staying as it is for a little while.
[22:19.34]Alright, alright, alright.
[22:20.38]Everybody relax.
[22:21.58]Let's go.
[22:22.18]Relax.
[22:23.44]Everybody just relax.
[22:28.05]We need to train him.
[22:29.55]What does he need?
[22:34.18]What exciting content.
[22:35.86]It will be very soon.
[22:36.98]Alright, we need... I forgot, yeah.
[22:43.05]Okay, so he only has power moves.
[22:46.01]So, he's terrible right now.
[22:49.09]The idea was we were making money with Sonic BB.
[22:54.33]BB Sonic, and then we were bringing him over here to make money.
[22:56.99]And then he lost... I remember the whole thing last night.
[23:04.72]That's fine.
[23:05.56]Um... He actually might be alright in the tournament.
[23:09.62]But I... Oh... No, no, no.
[23:11.62]I gotta be certain about this, because I have five dollars.
[23:16.27]Hmm.
[23:21.59]I hate this guy, but we have to use him, because his stats are amazing.
[23:29.31]We have to... BB Sonic has to win something.
[23:32.36]Because it has to be a guarantee, otherwise I'm going to lose all my money.
[23:34.96]And the game ends if you go broke.
[23:38.20]That's five loyalty!
[23:39.56]Not five... See, I told you I had a bad headache.
[23:41.69]Let's go, we're fighting them.
[23:43.65]We're going to go this way.
[23:46.85]Four entries, Blizzard Cup.
[23:51.17]Let's train him in... What's the number one thing we need to do?
[23:57.23]I'd say power, just to get it there.
[24:00.19]Just so he's not totally useless.
[24:09.39]That's pretty good.
[24:14.01]One power, aye-yi-yi, really.
[24:19.93]He has no INT move, I made this mistake with the pixie.
[24:22.67]That's true.
[24:24.67]But the difference is... If I can get money, we can train him in intelligence and he will learn an intelligence move, hopefully.
[24:36.09]Still tired, really.
[24:39.01]Because if he has 200 intelligence at this base level... He will wreck people with his int base move.
[24:51.46]Yeah, we got no money.
[24:53.78]I'm well aware of it, don't worry.
[25:00.83]He's been having... You've been having Monster Rancher 2 music-themed nightmares.
[25:12.86]No.
[25:15.15]His defense is okay.
[25:16.27]I'm gonna do defense.
[25:20.39]Defense... See, at some point, like, I'm not gonna give a shit about... I feel like speed, intelligence... I could do this one.
[25:30.38]Because who cares about power?
[25:31.48]I'm not gonna use it ever.
[25:33.16]I'm only gonna do one move with this guy anyways.
[25:35.16]Let's do defense.
[25:42.81]Yes, he gets hit every day.
[25:44.15]That's supposed to happen.
[25:48.51]What?
[25:51.79]How did you fail that?
[25:52.94]You're supposed to get hit by it.
[25:59.42]Shit.
[25:59.84]He has to eat potatoes.
[26:02.02]You have to eat potatoes for the rest of your life.
[26:10.50]He just has to win the tournament.
[26:16.19]He seems stressed out.
[26:18.09]Yeah.
[26:19.25]It's alright, I got just the thing.
[26:22.98]I got just the thing for you, Lorax.
[26:33.18]Oh yeah, it is St.
[26:34.28]Patrick's Day, isn't it?
[26:36.84]Oh yeah.
[26:39.99]Happy St.
[26:40.45]Patrick's Day.
[26:43.63]Welcome to the stream.
[26:47.83]um I really don't like the odds here if okay if I don't make if I don't win this tournament somehow or if I don't make any money here then we have to go back to Sonic for like a week or two I'm not talking in real stream time by the way I'm just talking like in game this guy's gonna be worth money I'm telling you
[27:12.32]That was a St.
[27:12.92]Patrick's Day.
[27:13.68]The holiday where it's an excuse to get shit-faced.
[27:19.32]Like it's different than any other Saturday.
[27:23.46]No, I mean, it's St.
[27:24.32]Patty's Day.
[27:24.92]That's why I can, like, drink a bunch of booze.
[27:27.83]Didn't you do that last weekend, too?
[27:30.63]Yeah.
[27:31.99]Oh.
[27:33.03]Okay.
[27:34.67]Just was curious.
[27:40.03]Bring back dab putty.

[31:04.74]That's all you needed.

[31:22.21]Look, I'm just going to win the whole Blizzard Cup.
[31:25.65]Right now.
[31:31.05]I have a headache.
[31:31.77]Why the fuck would I do that?
[31:36.35]Like, I've just done things completely opposite of what you should do if you have a headache.
[31:44.14]You know what I'm saying?
[31:44.86]I got a headache.
[31:45.38]Let me blow an air horn.
[31:49.84]I still could win this, although it's going to be tough.
[31:52.00]His life is so terrible.
[31:59.33]Oh, great.
[32:01.07]Oh, boy.
[32:04.91]That was pretty cool.
[32:05.71]Like, that was cool he missed, but that was really cool.
[32:09.88]He's gonna die instantly.
[32:11.42]He's got cool claws.
[32:16.08]Like, I mean, he sucks, but he'll get better.
[32:18.12]He needs an intelligence move.
[32:25.67]You don't think this is cool?
[32:27.39]Don't you guys like Wolverine?
[33:01.61]See, this is what happens in every Disney movie.
[33:05.32]What's going on?
[33:09.09]What's going on?
[33:12.13]Is he dead?
[33:20.28]Ah.
[33:26.22]Uh.
[33:27.72]Is he?
[33:29.28]Oh, I can't laugh right now.
[33:37.74]Ah.
[33:45.57]You got punched directly in the face and insta-died.
[33:48.39]Is that what happened here?
[33:58.12]No, I think Lorax Brimley is injured.
[34:01.22]It is a serious injury.
[34:07.52]Lorax Brimley is still in the hospital.
[34:09.33]I wish it would come back soon.
[34:15.46]I gotta like quell these laughs.
[34:17.02]It's been like a whole season His stats are so good He had like two hundred and like three or four stats.
[34:36.89]That's unheard of Hey, he's alright.
[34:40.91]He's out of the hospital
[34:44.91]There he is.
[34:45.39]There's the hospital.
[34:46.89]Let's see how he's doing.
[34:49.79]Okay, he likes milk.
[34:52.31]He's doing good.
[34:53.89]He made it out.
[34:57.47]He cares about stats when you have 67 health.
[34:59.89]Then we can train him.
[35:01.35]We'll train him.
[35:03.67]I'm not giving up on him.
[35:10.15]Uh-oh, we're out of money.
[35:14.44]More potatoes.
[35:15.14]That was fucking funny.
[35:27.31]How do we get the Tim Allen monster?
[35:32.57]He's very well.
[35:33.35]Train of life.
[35:43.15]That voice of milk?
[35:47.37]Faster than Sonic.
[35:48.53]Confirmed.
[35:49.07]God, that's so bad.
[35:55.62]He's doing well.
[36:00.80]Game's too loud?
[36:05.92]Oops.
[36:08.81]I love how the sentiment just changed completely.
[36:11.41]Everybody hates this guy.
[36:12.79]I hate this guy.
[36:16.19]But man, it's not like I hate this guy, but look at these stats.
[36:20.83]201, 166, 162.
[36:21.23]If we could just force him to have at least 120 health, and we learn the intelligence move, no one will beat him.
[36:40.50]He's got 69 HP.
[36:43.77]Here's what we're gonna do.
[36:45.73]We're gonna freeze him.
[36:47.05]We're gonna make, like, a few grand with Dab Sonic.
[36:58.00]Just get him old and then combine him with Sonic.
[36:59.78]I mean, that's the plan.
[37:02.12]We have to have a fairly good base to work with here.
[37:07.19]Let's freeze him, bring back Dab Sonic.
[37:12.23]Why am I calling him that?
[37:16.87]This is not... It's BB Sonic.
[37:19.91]No, it's Beanbag Sonic.
[37:26.45]Alright, bring him back.
[37:27.89]Let's win some money with Beanbag.
[37:35.06]We just need like two or three thousand.
[37:39.16]There he is.
[37:43.82]Your best friend.
[37:47.89]Oh, that's $100.
[37:52.55]Polo juice.
[37:55.26]Thank you for the $100, Polo.
[38:01.36]Huge, big money.
[38:02.72]Big money.
[38:04.60]And they say freeze him, jab him with a stick, sell him as a nice, as an ice lolly.
[38:14.58]Are you talking about that guy?
[38:21.55]Huge, big money.
[38:24.47]Thank you, Polo Juice, for the 100 bucks, man.
[38:26.43]It's fucking huge.
[38:29.79]Look at how much better he is.
[38:30.77]Like, he's so much more fun.
[38:37.59]He's so great.
[38:38.87]I love everything about this guy.
[38:41.09]Alright, now, make some money.
[38:44.49]I don't care if we have to go down to D. We're in D for Dire, as they say, guys.
[38:56.62]Wait, is that true?
[38:57.36]Wait, did I say... Wait, hold on.
[39:03.99]The new Twitch Terms of Service, I can't say that he gave $100?
[39:06.63]It's a 10,000 bits.
[39:07.19]Is that... Are you serious?
[39:08.72]That's not real.
[39:21.24]See or no balls, mad cuz bad.
[39:24.26]Who said that?
[39:24.96]Like somebody just randomly said that.
[39:37.64]Man, it's probably true, I don't know.
[39:43.79]I'm joking.
[39:44.51]I was like, what the fuck is going on here?
[39:46.56]Hey, remember these shitties?
[39:49.54]They're gonna all... It's a free thousand dollars.
[39:57.25]I wasted a year of Lorax's life.
[39:59.97]He'll be alright.
[40:01.09]We're gonna combine them anyways.
[40:12.34]I'm getting out of here before I get banned by association.
[40:14.98]Oh, look at, look at Millium.
[40:18.56]Millium?
[40:20.12]They just turned the W upside down?
[40:24.22]Oh, wait a minute.
[40:24.87]So like, no, but wait a second.
[40:27.17]That's okay.
[40:27.59]So William would be the W for woman, but Millium is an M. So I like what they did there.
[40:36.01]Interesting.
[40:40.56]What do you say we one-hit KO?
[40:52.85]This just feels wrong, doesn't it?
[40:56.03]Let's try to put her in the hospital.
[40:59.26]How dare you even attempt to go up against the powerful Dab Sonic!
[41:08.22]I feel bad.
[41:22.08]We will now hold the consolidat- Oh, this is their match.
[41:31.59]This guy, the final.
[41:33.19]He's gonna concede.
[41:36.69]Ah, that's too bad.
[41:37.81]Let's embarrass this guy.
[41:45.69]I have to go with at least one.
[41:47.69]Embarrass the lower rankings, right?
[41:52.25]Yeah, we're going to do just face dive, face dive.
[41:55.29]And just see if we can insta-kill him.
[41:58.33]Ooh, he went for it too.
[42:00.67]Alright, that's fine.
[42:01.97]It's alright.
[42:02.79]I'm going for a flare here.
[42:03.93]Although I've got to be careful.
[42:05.82]I'm the guy in the Disney movie that is so much better than the main character in every way.
[42:10.44]But for some reason, he does something really cocky.
[42:13.42]And even though he's way better in every single possible way, he loses.
[42:19.94]Don't you think that that Disney villain, that mean Disney bully has seen a Disney movie?
[42:25.95]You think you'd be watching that movie and be like, oh shit, I better be careful.
[42:30.87]I better not try to tie weights to my body to fight the next guy.
[42:43.57]Um, can I please hit him?
[42:45.96]Easy.
[42:47.10]There it is.
[42:48.08]Alright, kill him.
[42:48.86]Kill him.
[42:49.60]Kill.
[42:50.34]Kill shot.
[42:51.20]Kill him.
[42:52.02]Kill.
[42:58.60]Ah, it's alright.
[43:08.50]That's the worst monster in the whole game, by the way.
[43:11.66]The plant.
[43:14.13]This is awful.
[43:18.31]We did get CD chips, which means that... Doesn't that make it so you can make better monsters?
[43:21.65]Higher quality when you combine?
[43:22.63]This is a tournament.
[43:36.41]Giving me money.
[43:37.29]Thank you.
[43:43.79]How many fans?
[43:50.81]Who cares?
[43:51.45]All that matters is the money in this game.
[43:56.33]It doesn't matter.
[43:56.93]Why am I so cold right now?
[44:01.44]Fans give you more crit, but... You guys like him.
[44:06.56]He learned.
[44:13.49]Holy shit.
[44:15.23]This is the highest he's ever learned after a tournament.
[44:19.62]So he went and just bullied a bunch of people and got way more stats than he ever has before.
[44:24.84]Interesting.
[44:29.77]Not praising him.
[44:32.93]We have to get him out of doting.
[44:35.85]We gotta get him out of doting here.
[44:38.11]He's out of doting.
[44:38.93]He's done playing Dota.
[44:41.66]He's been in there in that shed for fucking three weeks straight playing Dota.
[44:45.47]Get out of the house, man.
[44:46.67]Come on.
[44:48.97]Alright, I need another tournament win.
[44:53.25]Save it.
[44:56.23]Oh my god.
[45:00.06]Frogman Savage just gave 10,000 bits.
[45:03.46]100 bucks.
[45:11.38]100!
[45:12.84]No message, just says, cheer, 10,000.
[45:15.48]Thank you so much, dude.
[45:18.45]Thank you, Frogman.
[45:20.07]Thank you, Polo Juice.
[45:21.01]There's other bits here, too.
[45:25.29]And we always get to them.
[45:28.07]But, Jesus Christ.
[45:30.57]That's $200 in fucking 8 minutes.
[45:34.93]Thanks to both of you.
[45:39.07]Sorry, sorry you had to report you on that one like saying that did the monetary value The beat wait Cronin says BB's has become a WWE villain zero fans only in it for the money.
[46:01.75]Oh
[46:07.75]You guys are too fucking kind to me, man.
[46:12.69]Like I told you before, be careful.
[46:15.15]Don't make me dotting.
[46:18.44]You know?
[46:20.34]Sometimes you guys have to be strict.
[46:25.62]We've seen what happened to our beloved BB Sonic.
[46:29.65]Too much spoiling and all of a sudden he doesn't want to fight anymore.
[46:40.15]Doting.
[46:48.59]Combine Lorax and Sonic with the disk chip thing and use the seasoning.
[46:52.64]Yeah, I will.
[46:54.38]Let's actually, you know what?
[46:55.62]Now that we have money to even look and see what would happen.
[46:58.28]Let's just go see if this is stupid.
[47:00.46]You understand?
[47:05.12]Let's go free Sonic.
[47:07.70]Stick a needle in there and suck out his juice.
[47:11.36]Squeeze that into a petri dish.
[47:18.16]We need to see the combination if it's gonna be worth it.
[47:22.32]Although, we might have like a... We might have a bad monster here.
[47:35.43]I'm gonna save it, don't worry.
[47:42.91]Everything I've done has been stupid.
[47:44.49]No, what?
[47:45.35]No, it hasn't.
[47:48.01]We got to, like, A rank with this guy.
[47:49.85]That's pretty good.
[47:53.43]Alright.
[47:55.67]Let's see what this is going to do for us.
[47:57.98]Combine.
[47:58.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:04.08]So, Beanbag Sonic.
[48:08.42]And Lorax Brimley.
[48:12.65]with a disk chip.
[48:16.02]Secret seasoning, throw it on there.
[48:20.28]This can be used as a secret seasoning.
[48:24.09]Alright, so fake penguin, tiger, frozen gaboo, kato, pink kato, fake penguin, or blue kato.
[48:41.40]That's just gonna- that's a normal- no.
[48:46.20]We already have one!
[48:48.84]Let's switch it around, see what happens.
[48:51.96]I'm not gonna do it, it's- this- this is trash!
[48:59.97]Unless maybe- if we get fake penguin maybe that'd be interesting.
[49:08.36]That's a Sonic character, the animals, right?
[49:10.56]Let's do it backwards.
[49:11.64]Let's do Lorax first.
[49:19.17]Add the CD fragment.
[49:20.43]Alright.
[49:27.77]We have a chance for a fake penguin.
[49:31.75]Who cares?
[49:32.35]Is it really a big deal?
[49:41.24]No.
[49:42.04]It's not worth it.
[49:45.08]So, shit, um... I'm not sure that any of this is even worth doing.
[49:49.06]What about Lorax and... Let's try Lorax and the Ball.
[50:02.45]Hit that Yes button.
[50:07.12]No, this guy sucks.
[50:11.61]Alright, we'll do it.
[50:12.27]We'll do it.
[50:13.70]We'll do it and we'll save Scummit.
[50:19.66]So, should I do Lorax first or should I do Beanbag first?
[50:30.89]77% chance of wall.
[50:33.49]Lorax first.
[50:37.68]I got it saved.
[50:38.14]Don't worry.
[50:42.16]Put in the seasoning.
[50:44.34]See what happens.
[50:48.58]This one's all up to you.
[50:49.63]Here we go.
[50:50.75]Do it.
[50:51.37]Let's go.
[51:04.66]We got the fake penguin.
[51:07.92]That's what I wanted.
[51:13.12]This is just real Sonic.
[51:19.12]This is just the same thing we had, but it's actually Sonic.
[51:24.33]Fake Penguin the Hedgehog.
[51:33.47]It's just Sonic Reborn.
[51:34.85]Alright, well this is because this is actual Sonic.
[52:00.42]Yes, yes, I know.
[52:01.68]I understand.
[52:02.31]I understand.
[52:03.63]Ass, Sonic.
[52:05.87]Funny ass.
[52:08.23]I'm not doing it.
[52:09.13]Here we go.
[52:10.31]Hey, Sonic.
[52:45.15]I don't know if I want to use this.
[52:46.23]What does he have for move?
[52:51.37]He likes fish, doesn't like milk.
[52:54.03]That's not good.
[52:57.16]Headbutt and slap.
[53:04.92]Nice eBay term.
[53:09.19]Should we use him?
[53:11.17]But that was a shitty, dumb, fake name.
[53:16.37]I don't know.
[53:17.33]I don't know about this.
[53:22.00]Nah, he sucks.
[53:25.24]Train his speed.
[53:26.04]I don't know, guys.
[53:26.54]I think he sucks.
[53:28.18]Let's just go back.
[53:30.64]The Delorax's stats were insane.
[53:36.80]They were so, so good.
[53:39.57]He just needs some training.
[53:41.67]We'll get to A rank with him.
[53:42.73]We will.
[53:46.79]We're going back in time.
[53:54.35]Create some more monsters.
[53:55.31]I have a bunch of CDs here that are rare monsters.
[54:09.87]I guess I could try... Let's put a couple of random discs in just to see if we get anything else.
[54:17.50]Can we get anything else?
[54:19.08]This game is called The Devil Inside.
[54:21.10]Never got to play it.
[54:21.78]It's an old PC game.
[54:30.27]Create the rare ones?
[54:31.25]I cannot until I get to the next rank, right?
[54:34.05]Or can I?
[54:34.41]That game's awesome.
[54:46.01]I really wish I could play it.
[54:48.91]I really do.
[54:49.47]I didn't even get to prove it.
[54:55.79]Hi guys.
[54:59.53]What do you get if you put Monster Rancher 1 in?
[55:01.99]You get the monster that dies in one day.
[55:05.03]There you go, there it is.
[55:13.61]I need to prove to you guys my ingredients.
[55:22.11]Don't do this shit again.
[55:23.03]Alright.
[55:23.63]Don't rare monster.
[55:31.88]Here's the big moment.
[55:32.56]Give us something we can work with.
[55:36.74]Sun's out, guns out.
[55:37.64]It's real dark out there.
[55:44.96]Not just like a default T-Rex or something.
[55:47.04]Something interesting.
[55:49.04]Something we can play with.
[55:53.88]This is a raspberry... I mean, it is the Easter Bunny.
[56:09.46]It's Cream, the rabbit.
[56:17.08]I told you, every single character is a Sonic character.
[56:34.33]Yeah, I know my Sonic because we talked about it yesterday.
[56:36.55]We did like a whole thing about it.
[56:38.93]Cream... I don't know.
[56:42.33]Like, it can't just be Cream, right?
[56:43.81]No, it is because there's nothing funny about this character.
[56:52.76]Cream... What an awful fucking name for a character.
[56:55.98]Like, why would you choose that?
[56:58.34]Come on, like Sonic the Hedgehog.
[57:01.55]Like, Tails is bad too.
[57:04.03]Big the cat.
[57:04.73]You're just saying stuff that they have on their body.
[57:09.21]He's big.
[57:10.67]He has a tail.
[57:12.83]Knuckles.
[57:13.35]He has those too.
[57:18.27]Krispy Kreme?
[57:20.09]I like Krispy Kreme.
[57:26.68]Hair.
[57:27.08]Alright, how about just...
[57:34.87]I like Krispy Kreme.
[57:38.32]How about just, how about, how about Christy Kreme?
[57:41.28]Like this.
[57:44.76]Yeah, Christy Kreme.
[57:46.62]Let me say yes.
[57:48.56]Can I fit it?
[57:49.72]C-R-E, let me see if I can fit it.
[58:03.78]C... K... R... I... A... I can't find it.
[58:10.91]Is this a porn star name?
[58:38.67]We're not gonna use this character so it doesn't fucking matter.
[58:41.49]Let's put in another CD.
[59:14.63]I can't, I can't get over that.
[59:15.95]That's, that's gonna, that's gonna drive me up, that's gonna drive me up the fucking wall.
[59:21.24]Freeze.
[59:28.42]How about, uh, how about Arthur's Knights, A Tale of Chivalry?
[59:35.63]Windows 95, 98 ME.
[59:36.11]Freeze.
[59:36.31]Freeze!
[59:42.26]You have too many frozen monsters, we have to make some space?
[59:46.67]Oh, fuck.
[59:48.57]What?
[59:49.41]I can't do anything- I- I can't do anything.
[59:52.57]I have to delete her.
[59:58.43]I can't, as long as I have one.
[60:01.70]Um... I have to delete somebody.
[60:09.36]Alright, who's- who is on the chopping block?
[60:16.35]And for those reasons, you've been shocked.
[60:27.48]Alright, let's do this.
[60:32.76]We need to make a little bit more room here.
[60:34.16]Okay, what about... We got DNA... I can't get rid of Edgehog.
[60:44.02]The rind.
[60:44.84]You know how many people are going to lose their mind if I delete this guy?
[60:49.10]And for those reasons... You've been shot!
[60:54.28]Alright, let's go back to the shrine.
[61:01.46]Stisk Slate.
[61:07.54]What's in here?
[61:10.92]Alright, this is another one of those multiple discs.
[61:12.58]We're just gonna use disk two of three.
[61:14.96]Couldn't play this game either, even on a virtual machine.
[61:18.70]No, no, no, it's not okay.
[61:19.72]It's not okay.
[61:26.23]Really nice design though.
[61:27.09]You know what I'm saying?
[61:29.13]This is like a nice designed game disk.
[61:31.76]See?
[61:32.78]Like the red.
[61:33.38]Looks like a T-Rex like stepped on it.
[61:36.30]Looks cool.
[61:43.56]Let's drain it.
[61:47.15]I can't believe Banana Spit is dead.
[61:51.59]Believe it.
[61:56.55]Would that... Would that cartoon... Would that... Would that cartoon ninja say?
[62:04.11]Believe it.
[62:09.81]I'm begging.
[62:15.17]Give us something good.
[62:19.77]Cowabunga?
[62:24.53]Big moment.
[62:26.59]I want to be like a guy with a cigar in his mouth.
[62:28.85]You know what I mean?
[62:29.28]Like a fat guy with a cigar.
[62:32.36]How do I look?
[62:37.22]DNA!
[62:41.24]Yeah, what did that president say?
[62:44.26]You know, like, what did that, like, President Ninja say?
[62:48.69]Believe me?
[62:50.11]Believe it?
[62:52.81]Somebody has to put him into, like, a Naruto and just have him say that over and over again.
[63:01.20]That defense is terrible.
[63:09.96]Same thing with the line, you're gonna get one hit killed.
[63:12.56]You're gonna get one hit KO'd, it's gonna be fucking terrible.
[63:21.14]That's a ton of skill and a bunch of speed, but it doesn't matter.
[63:24.38]What Sonic character is this?
[63:30.39]This is a Sonic character.
[63:33.47]Which one?
[63:38.65]Okay, it's, uh... It's not Chaos.
[63:44.35]Getting close there.
[63:46.57]Not Egg Robo.
[63:50.62]This is clearly just Plucky Duck.
[63:56.36]Bean the Dynamite.
[63:57.80]That's just Plucky from Tiny Toons.
[64:01.32]That could be Ray the Flying Squirrel.
[64:13.98]Why is Mario on this list?
[64:19.04]Small the cat.
[64:20.72]Yeah, that's small the cat.
[64:24.95]Just fucking delete him.
[64:25.85]I don't even want him.
[64:32.59]I just don't.
[64:33.09]I'm gonna be real.
[64:33.95]I just don't want that animal in my house.
[64:36.60]You know what I'm saying?
[64:39.84]Just because... I don't want that animal in my house.
[64:42.92]All the hair...
[64:45.22]The smell, you know, you can always tell when somebody owns a monster, you know?
[64:49.00]You go in their house and it smells like a monster in there and you're like, ah, this person obviously has a monster.
[64:57.40]You know, it's nice to not have hair in my food.
[65:00.64]What the fuck is this?
[65:02.51]Sold out software.
[65:03.91]Oh, okay, this is correct.
[65:15.24]They live outside?
[65:15.88]No they don't!
[65:16.38]They all live in a giant empty barn together!
[65:19.80]Did you not see the animations?
[65:23.12]Like the four of us live in a barn with a carpet on the ground.
[65:26.53]We don't even have a refrigerator!
[65:32.25]Where am I getting all this meat and shit?
[65:34.03]Where am I gonna get it from?
[65:42.88]I just ate McDonald's and didn't get sick.
[65:45.68]Fuck you.
[65:49.11]When?
[65:49.43]What?
[65:49.89]Are you talking?
[65:50.47]When did I say you were going to get sick?
[66:05.46]Alright, let's see.
[66:06.08]Come on.
[66:17.05]There we go, that's what I'm talking about.
[66:18.41]We'll get something from this.
[66:22.69]I'm not even gonna give a response to that one.
[66:27.25]Last attempt before we have to play with one of the people we have with good stats.
[66:30.47]Oh, we can go to the shrine.
[66:32.94]To the market and buy one, probably.
[66:34.98]We'll try that.
[66:39.70]Heart of Darkness is going in.
[66:41.72]Classic PlayStation 1 PC game.
[66:44.86]This game's fantastic.
[66:49.98]Let's see what we get.
[66:51.16]There's some like cheese on here.
[66:52.86]I don't know how there's cheese on this.
[66:56.25]It's probably not even cheese.
[66:57.03]It's probably just oil or something.
[66:58.01]It's probably like Vaseline.
[67:04.53]Finish it?
[67:04.99]I will.
[67:07.85]You better believe I will.
[67:18.60]Re-insert the Monster Rancher 2 disk into the tray, please.
[67:26.49]Alright, whatever this monster is, I don't care what it is.
[67:30.75]We're picking the name already.
[67:33.95]Before we even look at it, we're playing with this monster.
[67:36.03]We're going to use this monster.
[67:37.31]We're not going to fuck around.
[67:38.75]We're using this monster, whatever it is.
[67:40.99]We have to do something.
[67:41.83]We have to level up somebody.
[67:44.89]And calling this monster...
[67:48.69]Tim Allen.
[67:51.59]I don't care.
[67:51.99]I don't care what it is.
[68:04.58]Please make that not be a mistake.
[68:52.10]Stats really aren't that bad.
[68:53.76]That's enough to win a tournament.
[68:55.06]Can I spell Alan?
[69:00.07]Is it like Alan?
[69:01.33]It's like Alan, right?
[69:04.43]Tim Alan.
[69:05.57]Or is it A-L-A?
[69:06.73]Hold on.
[69:07.59]What's his fucking name?
[69:13.00]Yeah, it's Tim Alan.
[69:14.36]I got it right.
[69:17.24]Alright.
[69:19.78]Bullshit.
[69:20.80]Oh, no, no, no.
[69:32.35]This doesn't feel right.
[69:34.67]Let's go.
[69:37.57]Let's take a look.
[69:41.43]Good intelligence, good skill, good defense.
[69:44.18]Just really lacking in the... At least it's better than the last one.
[69:49.58]Doesn't like milk.
[69:51.16]Doesn't like mirror... Like, likes the mirror.
[69:55.84]Okay.
[69:58.70]Pat and kick.
[69:59.72]We need power...
[70:02.08]I think it's still possible.
[70:03.88]It's not bad.
[70:09.73]It's not a bad monster.
[70:22.89]We're gonna use... We're gonna use her.
[70:25.15]We're gonna use Tim Allen.
[70:27.71]People are gonna know it.
[70:28.49]Like, if you came to the stream and you just, you know... We make this joke a lot.
[70:34.15]But you'd be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[70:36.11]Alright, let's go.
[70:40.44]Because I'm just imagining, like, this is like a Tim Allen joke.
[70:44.90]That I have.
[70:47.26]Oh, this guy, this streamer must, like, name people Tim Allen.
[70:49.78]I wonder why.
[70:50.34]What's the story there?
[70:51.30]There is nothing there.
[70:52.94]We laughed at a track on a CD that was burnt into this game.
[70:58.65]It's probably gonna be the people who assume there's history there.
[71:00.93]It's not.
[71:03.41]Let's train power just so we can at least not lose instantly every tournament.
[71:14.02]Good.
[71:15.02]You can always tell the potential based on the first train.
[71:19.43]Let's get this to 125.
[71:29.76]And then we're gonna combine... Here's another thing, though.
[71:34.86]We need to see what the combination between her and Sonic will be.
[71:40.09]What kind of baby is Tim Allen and Sonic the Hedgehog gonna have?
[71:42.51]I don't know.
[71:49.91]You know, we kinda need to know what we're working with here.
[71:54.10]What does she like?
[71:56.64]She likes mirrors, dislikes... What does she dislike?
[71:59.26]I forget already.
[72:01.42]Well, you're getting a cup of jelly because I want the fucking five piece.
[72:11.79]She doesn't like milk, okay.
[72:14.25]Now peel off that sticker and let me take it, please!
[72:18.05]Give it to me.
[72:20.39]Tim Allen's well, come on.
[72:23.84]We can't do any battles.
[72:25.44]We need to go see what we're up against here.
[72:29.22]Just, we need to be sure.
[72:30.78]Because we're only going to get like one opportunity.
[72:32.70]We'll get her to a position where we can train her.
[72:35.02]There's $100 just came in.
[72:35.54]Why?
[72:35.64]What?
[72:35.84]The great Lord Walden gave me $100 here.
[72:42.36]Not dollars.
[72:42.68]Why?
[72:56.64]And they say, cheer 10,000.
[72:59.48]And they do the Tim Allen.
[73:04.79]I'll try it for you.
[73:10.31]Hold on, wait.
[73:11.21]Give me one minute.
[73:16.55]Be right back.
[74:36.34]This is not what I was expecting was going to happen, but it's alright.
[74:41.29]I tried to... I tried to make the... Alright, here's what it was.
[74:50.49]Are you guys ready?
[74:51.19]This just sounds like a fucking whale.
[74:54.29]I tried to make the tool man sound with the air horn.
[75:00.17]And this is what I came up with.
[75:05.85]It needs to be a little bit faster.
[75:08.77]Let's change the tempo a little bit there.
[75:17.45]Faster.
[75:20.71]A lot faster, actually.
[75:24.91]Faster.
[75:25.23]OK.
[75:28.99]A little bit lower.
[75:36.40]Drop the pitch a little bit.
[75:42.66]One more.
[75:43.06]It's just like a sad wail.
[75:57.79]No.
[75:57.99]What the happened there?
[76:04.34]Well, I tried.
[76:05.86]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[76:14.88]This is not going to sound right at all, but I don't... This is just a guy and his dog doing a Tim the Tool Man impression.
[76:25.24]Wait, I didn't sound like that.
[76:27.54]Did I?
[76:32.49]That changed pitch on its own.
[76:45.25]I did not sound like that before.
[76:47.37]Maybe I did.
[76:47.89]I'm going to make this sound a little bit different.
[76:58.25]Make a C major chord.
[77:14.20]No, I'm done.
[77:15.24]This is getting fucking stupid.
[77:21.48]Goodbye.
[77:21.98]It's over.
[77:22.38]Alright, we tried.
[77:23.22]Back to the game.
[77:29.82]We tried.
[77:30.34]It didn't work.
[77:42.32]It's always been stupid.
[77:43.73]Quality content here at the, uh, Jerma985 channel.
[77:48.89]Uh, but, whoa, wait, thanks for the hundred fucking dollars, dude.
[77:51.99]Like, I don't know, you... You deserve a little more than just a shitty whale doing the Tim Allen sound.
[77:58.08]Thanks a lot, man.
[78:02.54]That's incredibly generous of you, thank you.
[78:04.82]Thank you to the lot of you.
[78:08.10]And with that, let's see who we get.
[78:14.58]Let's freeze her and see because this whole thing might be a waste of time You know the guy comes out and says oh, that's a terrible combination.
[78:23.10]Don't do that.
[78:24.18]It's like okay.
[78:24.88]Well, I just wasted a whole bunch of time Referenced currency.
[78:31.97]Yes Already Combined 500 gold
[78:43.19]See what we get.
[78:43.81]Beanbagsonic.
[78:46.45]And... Tim Allen.
[78:52.92]With some seasoning.
[78:56.22]Zoom chips.
[78:59.48]This can be used as secret seasoning.
[79:01.44]This one's all up to you.
[79:09.26]I mean, there's... I don't know what Dayton is.
[79:11.72]Datton?
[79:12.60]Mint?
[79:13.88]Granitey?
[79:18.62]Rockhound?
[79:29.34]Save and do it?
[79:31.70]No, but don't we need to level up Tim Allen?
[79:38.91]Let's switch him around.
[79:40.71]Didn't somebody tell me that if Beanbag is not first, we don't get his stats?
[79:49.33]Somebody confirm that.
[79:50.15]Say yes or no.
[79:50.91]If Beanbag is not first, then it's not a good idea, right?
[80:01.24]Yes, that's true.
[80:02.04]Beanbag has to be first.
[80:03.76]See?
[80:04.24]So we can't do that.
[80:05.46]It has to be Beanbag first.
[80:12.71]Let's save scum and see what happens.
[80:14.17]Because if it's good, then we're gonna use it.
[80:21.53]Because we're looking for our A and S rank monster right now.
[80:39.44]Nobody said that?
[80:40.88]Everybody just said that.
[80:44.50]Let's give it a go with the chips.
[80:50.37]Please don't combine.
[80:52.83]Please don't fuse BBs because you love him.
[80:56.53]Well, guess what?
[80:57.27]He gets to live on, right?
[80:59.87]Beanbag Sonic is about to die.
[81:05.08]If Beanbag Sonic dies, then he'll be a memory, but his DNA can live on right now if we harvest him now.
[81:11.23]And that was a bad way to say that.
[81:12.63]What I'm trying to say is, what do we get if we do Crispy Crane?
[81:26.37]This prospect is fine.
[81:27.41]It will probably work out.
[81:31.97]Hairhound.
[81:40.52]Sonic and Cream creates tails potentially here.
[81:47.86]Should we try it?
[81:48.30]It's gonna be a shitty rabbit.
[82:06.56]Let's just try it and then save Scummit and try it again.
[82:15.76]There's something with a lot of good stats.
[82:19.63]Come on.
[82:20.03]What is it?
[82:22.97]This, you know, it's funny because this is actually what would happen if Sonic and Kareem had a baby.
[82:26.83]This is what would happen.
[82:33.06]That's pretty good stats.
[82:35.74]It's just a blue Revan.
[82:53.88]Let's do the other one.
[83:06.27]I love save scumming.
[83:10.33]Dude, when I used to play on emulators
[83:13.01]It would be so awesome, you'd get to one spot and instantly reload that save in a tenth of a second.
[83:19.49]Even if you thought you had a potent- even if you had- there was a potential that it wasn't gonna happen what you wanted to have happen.
[83:26.40]I remember playing lots of games, like RPGs for instance, like back- You could do- even if the move didn't hit the right percentage you wanted, just instantly load back five seconds.
[83:36.95]I had a button that was, it was F5 and F6.
[83:40.13]F5 was save, F6 was load.
[83:42.81]So you could literally be walking down a hallway in like a platforming game.
[83:47.49]And it, just press F5.
[83:49.74]Okay, I'm fine, I have full health.
[83:50.88]F5.
[83:52.10]Get that monster, go, like jump around as Mega Man.
[83:53.92]Jump around, shoot that monster.
[83:55.28]F5.
[83:56.18]And if you take one point of damage, F6!
[83:58.56]And you're back to where you were a second ago.
[84:01.64]I love, I used to love doing that.
[84:03.09]F5.
[84:06.09]We all save.
[84:06.83]Everybody does it.
[84:07.35]It's a little lab.
[84:15.86]Let's try the other way around.
[84:19.94]It gets even better nowadays.
[84:20.90]You have a rewind button.
[84:24.03]Sounds amazing.
[84:26.35]Alright, let's do Beanbag Sonic.
[84:32.43]And...
[84:35.63]Tim Allen.
[84:36.75]Use the seasoning and see what we get from this one.
[84:41.65]There's a potential to get Mint or Dayton.
[84:49.26]That's the highest percentage there.
[84:51.64]Or Granitee.
[84:52.72]We already have a Granitee.
[84:55.64]Let's see what happens.
[85:05.58]Have to be worth our while.
[85:06.48]Alright, it's Pixie.
[85:12.77]This is Katana from Mortal Kombat.
[85:16.61]What are the stats?
[85:18.73]Ooh, no.
[85:20.35]No.
[85:21.66]Nope.
[85:25.42]No.
[85:26.90]No, no, no.
[85:45.18]Shit.
[85:46.70]Oh, we have to level up somebody.
[85:48.90]Who's a good prospect?
[85:55.07]BBs and DNA?
[85:56.19]We could try it.
[85:56.93]Well, let's just do it.
[85:57.85]Let's just do a couple things, see if we can get somebody else.
[86:06.17]BB and DNA.
[86:07.73]Oh, we could just level up the fucking wall.
[86:12.22]For all I care.
[86:14.80]Oh.
[86:22.83]We've played this game for more than 10 hours and yet haven't even chosen a monster to play.
[86:28.89]We're currently at A rank with BB Sonic.
[86:33.58]And he's about to die.
[86:34.44]He'll be dead in two months.
[86:37.82]Potentially.
[86:39.56]So we need to see how we can use him before he dies.
[86:49.81]Oh, we got Cabalos.
[86:53.23]Oh, if we get a Cabalos or a Striker, look at those.
[86:56.05]Do it.
[87:06.46]Give us a Striker.
[87:10.92]What is it?
[87:12.78]Ooh, okay, is this good?
[87:14.38]Good?
[87:17.54]Cabalos?
[87:29.10]Purple dog?
[87:33.41]It's not bad.
[87:37.38]It's good.
[88:02.05]That's gonna be so bad.
[88:04.89]Twitch dog.
[88:09.52]But I have to live with that for a while, so I'm not sure I want to do this.
[88:14.58]Courage.
[88:15.52]I like courage.
[88:16.50]That's a good one.
[88:18.52]Let's give it a little bit of a French twist.
[88:20.30]What do you say?
[88:20.84]How do I do it?
[88:21.40]Let's see.
[88:21.70]Courage.
[88:22.50]Courage.
[88:30.44]Where's...
[88:51.50]No, it'd have to be, like, ra... I don't even know.
[88:55.32]French courage.
[88:58.43]Play the game with the Lorax.
[89:00.15]No, but now we can combine... What about Cujo?
[89:04.93]Isn't that a garage?
[89:12.07]I'm just spelling courage.
[89:15.92]Hmm.
[89:18.10]This is important.
[89:19.00]This is important.
[89:21.02]Hmm.
[89:24.92]How about this?
[89:25.58]How about this?
[89:26.16]I got this.
[89:26.50]No, why would I want to do this?
[89:29.86]I was gonna do, uh, Cor-Cor-Coray-Coray Jesus.
[89:35.79]See?
[89:36.57]He's courageous, yes.
[89:56.39]Isn't that funny?
[89:58.77]Kura.
[90:01.34]Kura.
[90:25.69]Not even a joke.
[90:34.08]It's a purple dog!
[90:34.94]What do you want me to name it?
[90:35.94]Like Twitch dog?
[90:36.88]So.
[90:48.93]It's got really good skill.
[90:50.45]Decent power.
[90:51.13]The life could be... You need to improve that life.
[90:54.65]Skill and speed are the top stats here.
[90:57.60]We could probably enter a tournament and win, but I ain't going to do that.
[91:00.94]We're going to do power.
[91:02.92]We just have to scream instant victory.
[91:10.86]Good.
[91:15.52]BB died for this.
[91:18.56]BB didn't die.
[91:19.56]I just...
[91:23.97]What do you want me to do?
[91:27.11]You understand?
[91:29.13]He's gonna die eventually.
[91:31.31]He likes meat, he doesn't like milk, he's bad.
[91:35.04]And look, he's got a fucking ton of moves!
[91:37.02]Are you guys for real?
[91:39.02]Just look at this!
[91:41.44]You want me to get rid of him?
[91:42.74]Get rid of him.
[91:43.60]He has an off-the-bat, an S sharpness.
[91:47.17]This thing is gonna crit every fucking time.
[91:48.87]This is called Ice Bomb.
[91:53.19]But there, let me throw this guy back in the fryer later.
[92:03.06]Look at this S hit rating.
[92:06.62]This is the best monster we've ever had.
[92:08.72]And you guys want me to throw him away?
[92:13.21]No, no, no.
[92:15.27]Do not think so.
[92:19.05]So this guy has to be very balanced then.
[92:21.11]So we need to do intelligence, we gotta do everything.
[92:25.04]When's the first battle?
[92:26.58]Tomorrow.
[92:28.90]He's not ready.
[92:29.76]Let's actually train him.
[92:32.24]Train him up in power.
[92:35.59]Make sure the loyalty's there.
[92:36.55]We're gonna take this one seriously.
[92:38.55]Dead seriously.
[92:42.17]Fail.
[92:42.57]Fucking sell him.
[92:44.23]Harvest him immediately.
[92:50.82]He's not weird enough.
[92:51.86]No, this is just our way.
[92:53.46]This is our gateway to find a weirder monster.
[92:56.65]Because think about this.
[92:58.31]If we get him to A ranking, I can use some of these other dumb, weird, shitty CDs that have rare monsters on them we can't pull out.
[93:04.77]Let him rest.
[93:11.78]Let's get him to at least 20 to 30 loyalty.
[93:21.31]Kura is very well.
[93:22.67]Let's just focus on one thing at a time.
[93:25.93]Let's get power to like 150.
[93:26.73]Very nice.
[93:39.81]Buttlust is dead.
[93:40.59]Yes, he is.
[93:44.99]You can use them if you win the international championship.
[93:48.95]He likes meat.
[93:50.21]Don't have enough money for meat.
[93:55.04]Uh... Have some jelly.
[93:59.18]Are you sure?
[94:02.97]Int wouldn't be better.
[94:04.05]I'm not sure.
[94:05.49]We need to actually see how much damage and how effective and how... It's a tough one.
[94:10.31]I don't know.
[94:21.84]Training.
[94:22.82]Drill.
[94:23.30]Do power again.
[94:24.33]I think we should do balanced.
[94:27.09]We should do pretty much everything.
[94:34.57]No money again.
[94:36.36]He cheated.
[94:38.86]Why did he cheat?
[94:43.44]Don't scold him.
[94:46.08]It's okay to cheat sometimes.
[94:47.83]We just talked about saves coming in emulators.
[94:52.34]I'm not gonna be a hypocrite, you know?
[95:02.24]No, come on, internet!
[95:03.64]Cut the shit.
[95:11.47]Oh my god.
[95:12.25]Don't do- We just, like, got started with this.
[95:15.19]Don't do this nonsense, please.
[95:19.71]Oh my fucking god.
[95:26.90]Hold on, wait, hold on.
[95:29.72]Let's use as little bandwidth as we can right now.
[95:41.04]God damn it.
[95:49.63]What if... Oh, we just were getting started.
[95:52.75]This is so irritating.
[95:55.17]If for... This is infuriating.
[95:59.71]But if for some reason we turn off, then I'm sorry.
[96:05.65]But I'm at like 72k up right now.
[96:13.15]If anybody can hear me, I'm going to give this a good like five minutes or so.
[96:21.66]And if you don't come back, then I will see you all tomorrow.
[96:33.20]It might go through.
[96:34.68]We might be able to weather the storm here.
[96:45.09]Depends.
[96:48.72]72 kilobytes up.
[96:50.58]And now we're up to 35.
[96:51.70]It's bouncing from 35 to 1,000.
[96:55.60]Well, you guys can gauge it by looking at the screen, I guess.
[97:01.42]Stream in 180p.
[97:02.99]It'll be the same.
[97:10.67]Stop looking at Tim Allen grunts off-stream.
[97:19.09]Hold on.
[97:19.45]Hold on.
[97:19.83]Come on.
[97:20.33]I see green.
[97:21.47]I see green.
[97:22.05]Come on.
[97:29.28]Stay, please.
[97:30.98]At least you guys can hear me talk.
[97:39.00]You don't need a consistent upstream.
[97:41.73]Well, I know, but I need a upstream.
[97:49.02]Because it's dropping down to 72, which is not even a stream.
[98:03.09]It's going down to... It's bouncing between like 100k and then like 1000k and then 3000 and then 50 and then 0.
[98:08.25]It's just not...
[98:13.95]Even if I lowered the stream bitrate down to, like, 100.
[98:16.03]That would be a cell phone video.
[98:19.47]I'd have to turn the stream off first.
[98:27.39]I swear.
[98:32.63]Right when we get going, too.
[98:33.65]Of course.
[98:34.03]Of course they wait.
[98:36.00]Thanks, Comcast.
[98:36.62]At least you waited for that.
[98:37.42]Like, after the Tim Allen joke.
[98:38.50]That was fun.
[98:41.48]I think it'll come back.
[98:48.08]First impressions for 240p quality.
[98:51.22]Yeah, it'd be like, what the fuck am I doing here?
[98:55.00]What if I just do this?
[98:57.85]Is this like too... Is that too much for the internet to handle?
[99:15.94]just reset your internet and it'll fix.
[99:18.74]I can assure you that that's not gonna be fixed.
[99:32.51]Come on.
[99:33.16]Alright, I'm gonna wave my hand around and you guys tell me, can you see my hand moving?
[99:43.37]Is it like in full quality or is it breaking up like every two seconds here?
[99:49.09]Very cinematic feature.
[99:50.59]We just went down to like zero.
[99:55.07]Just narrate the game instead.
[100:00.47]You look terrible.
[100:03.93]Yeah, but I would assume so.
[100:05.67]I didn't get very much sleep last night.
[100:06.89]I haven't had a haircut in like seven months.
[100:11.91]I can't get out of this fucking room.
[100:17.31]I get fed through the window.
[100:20.73]You understand?
[100:24.41]He sends food to me through the fucking window.
[100:27.04]I got pants on, right?
[100:30.34]Yeah.
[100:35.88]Well, sorry everybody that this is happening.
[100:37.96]I obviously never plan on this, but sometimes you just can't do anything about it.
[100:49.73]What happens if I do this?
[100:50.71]I'm just curious.
[100:54.77]I gotta write like a thing on the screen that says like, internet sucks, hold on.
[101:11.65]Um...
[101:16.00]I was going to say the internet sucks, but that's too broad of a paint stroke there.
[101:28.67]I'm seeing a lot more green than red right now.
[101:35.88]Alright, so my downstream right now is perfectly normal.
[101:42.34]There's absolutely zero issues with my downstream.
[101:45.14]Let's see when my upstream is going to be a mess.
[101:48.08]Why?
[101:52.25]No, it ain't even.
[101:52.93]It ain't even.
[101:54.23]It's not even.
[101:56.19]My upstream is fine.
[101:57.33]What's going on?
[101:57.69]It's a Twitch problem.
[101:59.05]It's their ingest server.
[102:00.05]Be right back.
[102:01.85]Don't fucking go anywhere.
[102:02.79]This is going to fix the problem right now.
[102:03.84]Be right back.
[102:44.57]It's fixed.
[102:44.93]I can talk.
[102:57.14]Like, why am I not talking?
[102:58.37]I swear to God, sometimes.
[103:06.65]How's it look?
[103:20.23]I think this server is also having problems, but not as much as the other one is.
[103:24.47]Looks alright.
[103:33.44]I think we're ready to go.
[103:39.12]I'm going to keep an eye on it, but that was... I'm dropping a lot of frames here too, but not even close to as many as I am.
[103:45.14]Why is there a sweaty goblin in the corner of the screen?
[103:48.48]Because... Because I'm a sweaty goblin.
[103:51.96]And you're watching a stream that's being ran by a sweaty goblin.
[103:58.34]That wasn't in the title?
[104:01.07]Should be.
[104:02.67]Fuck, it's... No, it's dying again.
[104:04.43]I don't think it's a me problem, though.
[104:07.49]I'm gonna do one more test.
[104:24.66]Because I think this is a Twitch East Coast server problem here.
[104:37.08]Well, it worked for a second.
[104:44.90]Yeah, my upload is fine on my end here.
[104:48.97]I think it's a Twitch problem.
[104:53.27]Or something like that.
[104:56.26]Well, let me know if it gets to be unbearable, which it probably already is.
[105:00.44]Alright, let's train.
[105:07.33]Sorry to everybody.
[105:08.43]I mean, I'm sure a lot of people kind of were just like, eh.
[105:10.25]What if you're sticking around still?
[105:22.41]Because I can't even see the chat now.
[105:28.07]Alright, let's do a drill.
[105:28.97]Power again.
[105:33.79]He's cheating again.
[105:34.63]Why does he keep cheating?
[105:35.49]This is bad.
[105:41.10]I lost 600 viewers?
[105:42.14]Eh, whatever.
[105:43.96]That's gonna happen.
[105:46.34]I mean, if somebody... If streams happen to have a bunch of technical problems and there's, like, an internet issue, then, I mean...
[105:51.62]It's not like I'm gonna expect everybody to be like, no, sit right there, nobody move, for like 40 minutes while I just sit here silently trying to fix my computer internet issue.
[106:04.42]So, no, I understand.
[106:07.12]Official tournament's happening this week.
[106:14.53]He seems to be in good shape.
[106:21.47]Who is it?
[106:22.81]You have mail.
[106:23.31]Alright, good.
[106:25.59]Is it from... It's the item shop, I think.
[106:27.79]Yeah.
[106:29.77]No, we don't have enough money.
[106:30.83]Alright, let's win.
[106:35.76]Win, win, win.
[106:39.08]What is the tournament?
[106:41.40]Well, don't... What the hell are you doing, man?
[106:47.37]Uh, battle.
[106:48.23]It's right now.
[106:50.25]500 gold, 6 entrance.
[106:53.25]Not ready for it.
[106:53.81]Just sleep.
[106:56.37]I want at least 20 to 30 loyalty.
[107:05.92]He likes me, but we can't give it to him.
[107:07.38]You're gonna have to have another jelly cup, and then you have to win a tournament for us.
[107:22.26]Why is Cura its name?
[107:24.74]Because it was supposed to be Courage.
[107:28.40]And I don't know... We were gonna do, like, Courage with a... It's hard for me to explain my idiocy, but it's just there.
[107:36.85]Alright, here we go.
[107:38.93]Training again, power.
[107:40.81]Don't cheat this time, please.
[107:44.09]Is it safe to feed a dog Jello?
[107:48.49]Um, I don't know.
[107:52.94]Like, as encouraged the Cowardly Dog.
[107:56.42]Twitch Dog was better.
[107:57.76]Twitch Dog.
[108:06.61]You know, now that I think about it, I fucking wish it was Twitch Dog.
[108:11.68]Stop cheating!
[108:15.92]Stop cheating!
[108:17.46]You're not getting points.
[108:22.49]Scald!
[108:23.01]Enough!
[108:31.94]He's well.
[108:33.82]If he would just stop cheating.
[108:34.82]And get four points instead of one by cheating.
[108:40.58]But he fails it if he doesn't cheat.
[108:42.98]Finally.
[108:49.17]He learned how to save scum, that's why.
[108:53.61]as well what do we got now we got 141 power health is pretty much is an issue defense is also an issue I'm gonna do defense defense in life if I can his power in life but he loses speed no let's just do defense they learn by watching you
[109:23.52]He's good.
[109:23.88]Nice work.
[109:28.32]Just hit F6 over and over again.
[109:37.82]Uh, fuck.
[109:41.48]He hates fish, right?
[109:44.34]Does he?
[109:46.72]Does he hate fish?
[109:56.43]He's either fish or milk.
[109:58.59]Probably should look that up, right?
[110:02.03]Give him potato.
[110:02.83]No, he's gonna get stressed out before a tournament.
[110:06.91]He hates you.
[110:12.02]Dogs will eat anything.
[110:13.28]Does the fish have eyelashes?
[110:29.34]Dude, fish don't have eyelashes?
[110:32.00]That's absurd!
[110:35.80]What is he doing?
[110:38.60]What's wrong with you?
[110:42.14]Fuck you too.
[110:46.45]Where's he going?
[110:47.89]Hey!
[110:48.43]Hey!
[110:49.11]Hey!
[110:50.05]Excuse me!
[110:52.01]Excuse me?!
[110:54.35]Where is he going?
[111:03.35]Yes, who is it?
[111:06.15]You have... What the hell is going on?
[111:19.94]He's stressed out.
[111:22.70]Why did that take... Okay, that was weird.
[111:26.54]I don't have enough money.
[111:27.24]I need... Do I have any items?
[111:33.55]We have no items.
[111:37.93]He's just back there sleeping.
[111:38.89]Now we've got two days.
[111:42.05]Let's do... Let's rest, and then we'll train.
[111:44.79]And then we'll see if we can do anything about it.
[111:48.00]Sell some of those monsters?
[111:48.96]I... They have to be to a certain rank.
[111:52.34]I guess.
[111:52.66]He's very well.
[111:59.10]Train.
[111:59.88]Drill.
[112:01.08]Let's do life this time.
[112:06.43]Wait, Kura says, I want bone.
[112:11.24]Do you want to give it bone?
[112:12.76]20 bucks?
[112:14.72]Yeah, you can have it.
[112:21.04]Highly intelligent dog apparently can talk.
[112:36.92]6 plus 1!
[112:39.40]He gets additions.
[112:41.64]You guys are fucking crazy.
[112:49.62]I think he can do it.
[112:50.42]20 loyalty.
[112:53.36]I think he can do it.
[112:55.04]Plus, do you see... Everyone that's talking about, wow, he's... He sucks.
[112:59.22]You didn't even see the moves he has.
[113:02.48]He's got some crazy abilities.
[113:13.05]See, this is the monster puppy cup.
[113:20.38]Monster pups.
[113:25.34]We're gonna see Ice Bomb for the first time.
[113:30.98]Oh, we got info.
[113:32.12]Opponent has high skill.
[113:36.60]That's fine.
[113:39.50]The one I do have a big concern, it's the health.
[113:42.98]The health and the defense are as low as... They're not as low as Lorax, but... Holy shit, man.
[113:53.31]This guy's much... Hmm.
[113:56.95]Okay, so it's all about... I just... It's gonna be tough, actually.
[114:05.85]Let's try an Ice Bomb here.
[114:14.51]Nice.
[114:14.95]Alright.
[114:15.39]That move's kind of dumb.
[114:17.63]But it's alright.
[114:22.95]And he's angry now.
[114:25.04]He's angry and confused.
[114:32.62]Let's give him the 1-2.
[114:34.60]I got a lot of points to spend here.
[114:39.05]Come on.
[114:45.13]I need a break.
[114:54.06]Fight him.
[114:55.18]Come on, hit him with something!
[114:56.38]I'm gonna lose.
[115:00.48]He wasn't ready.
[115:01.81]He wasn't even close to being ready.
[115:10.22]He wasn't even remotely close to fight in any tournament.
[115:15.20]He needs, like, another month or two, at least, of training.
[115:22.62]That was sad as all hell.
[115:26.99]But it's alright, though.
[115:30.47]He's not bad.
[115:31.05]We just gotta get him trained.
[115:33.21]He's got a lot of great moves.
[115:36.81]But honest to God, though, he...
[115:38.97]That move is an S. He has two S hit moves.
[115:43.57]And they were at like 50% the whole time.
[115:47.36]It's alright.
[115:49.74]This is more... This is what we're looking at here.
[115:53.64]We're fighting against like a golden retriever.
[115:58.00]His defense is pretty bad.
[115:59.40]That's fine.
[116:05.43]That was fucking cool if he would hit it.
[116:13.62]They fucking... They hate the both of us.
[116:21.32]Wow.
[116:25.84]Give him a scratch.
[116:26.56]No, I want to hit the one too.
[116:28.46]That was good.
[116:33.49]Nice work.
[116:36.79]Let's try charge.
[116:39.45]Good.
[116:46.53]The moves aren't doing very much damage, but they're still at least interesting.
[116:52.00]Man, how... You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.
[116:56.06]Like... And I get foolery right there?
[117:04.43]What the fuck?
[117:17.38]Oh, we're gonna go... We're gonna lose three in a row.
[117:39.35]Fusing with the rind.
[117:44.19]No, it's... It's not the fact that... He's not bad.
[117:48.17]It's the problem with... You need to train, like, a monster for, like, six months before you can get him into a tournament and win.
[117:55.42]I mean, that's just my opinion.
[117:58.80]Because their loyalty is just so low.
[118:03.06]You have to buy... Really should buy, like, the loyalty food or whatever and just spam it until it's at, like, 40.
[118:11.79]And you also have to get RNG lucky, too, in some of these early fights.
[118:14.98]You're at 50% almost the whole time.
[118:18.02]He's not bad.
[118:21.94]Might as well just stick with the ones that are, like, almost guaranteed hits, which are, you know, the S-rank ones.
[118:27.35]We'll give him those.
[118:38.44]He's taking so much damage.
[118:40.19]I'm going to get double tapped here.
[118:41.71]I'm going to lose.
[118:43.49]That was good.
[118:44.29]At least I got that off.
[118:51.79]Frames.
[118:52.23]Yeah, there's nothing I can do about it.
[118:57.29]You have to play the game well.
[118:59.69]Well, um... I hope you realize that this is literally throwing dice at each other.
[119:08.80]It's like throw dice in the air the video game.
[119:10.56]I think that's what we're playing right now.
[119:27.24]I'm in denial?
[119:28.14]How am I in denial?
[119:29.16]I have a 40-50% chance to hit every time.
[119:33.24]Sometimes you miss every single time.
[119:34.96]How am I supposed to do better?
[119:38.62]If I flip a- alright, if I flip a coin, and I don't get heads... Does that make me bad at flipping coins?
[119:53.24]Alright, I wanna get heads right now.
[119:54.52]Ding!
[119:55.18]Tails!
[119:55.74]Fuck, I suck!
[119:57.32]I'm so terrible!
[120:11.88]One side has a 51% chance.
[120:13.56]I made that joke a while ago.
[120:14.54]It's still relevant!
[120:26.69]Don't blame the coin, man.
[120:28.10]No, I didn't want to praise him.
[120:29.64]I wanted to be angry with him.
[120:39.28]Have you ever played Hearthstone before?
[120:42.00]I used to play Hearthstone.
[120:44.62]Alright, let's take a look.
[120:50.12]What the hell am I going to do to him?
[120:53.50]He's good.
[120:55.00]His skill is great.
[120:57.55]But that... I don't understand.
[121:00.53]So if I have 200 skill and I have S-ranked moves...
[121:06.57]Why was I only getting like a 40, 50% chance to hit on a 60% highest?
[121:10.19]200 is a huge amount of skill to have.
[121:13.03]With an S scaling, that seems kind of like those moves should be 80 or 70.
[121:18.32]Like, what the heck?
[121:20.00]What the heck, man?
[121:24.84]Let's go do defense.
[121:31.00]Um, I'm gonna do this once because I kind of, I want to see what it does, and we have never done it, and I need defense in life.
[121:36.56]Those are the two most absolute, urgent stats that we need.
[121:47.58]He needs to sleep first.
[121:50.72]Oh, what?
[121:56.19]No, what the heck?
[122:00.35]loyalty plays a big role in just about everything yeah that's what I'm saying like it's really want to get him to a position where we can win and you just can't like if half the time that you attack he goes I don't know what that means he's gonna lose just getting fish
[122:31.11]No, no potatoes.
[122:32.07]I don't want to stress him out.
[122:44.98]Let's see what swim does.
[122:45.96]Apparently swimming makes you dumb.
[122:58.45]Did he do it?
[123:05.78]Come on, man.
[123:11.37]He just drowns in the water.
[123:14.43]Oh, God.
[123:16.27]Do it again.
[123:17.27]Get it right this time.
[123:24.12]Why can't I have that bird as a monster?
[123:25.96]Why does it have to be these dumb, idiot monsters?
[123:28.42]They can't do any swimming techniques.
[123:31.70]He did it.
[123:32.22]Good.
[123:38.09]Plus eight.
[123:38.81]I mean, that's pretty good.
[123:46.03]That's good.
[123:51.25]Use a mega death CD.
[123:53.43]I don't have any mega death CDs.
[123:56.83]Yeah, -2 intellect.
[124:04.77]That's alright.
[124:08.99]Get up, get up, get up.
[124:21.56]I would lose some intelligence if I drowned.
[124:24.64]Probably.
[124:30.00]Let him rest.
[124:36.14]Just spam swim.
[124:39.25]I'm being so hard on him?
[124:40.33]No, I'm not.
[124:40.89]I'm soft right now.
[124:41.99]I'm trying to make it so I'm even.
[124:45.14]I am running out of money.
[124:55.55]Yeah, he's gonna have to just be dumb.
[125:03.09]Still, how am I still soft on him?
[125:04.47]I don't understand.
[125:11.31]Soft?
[125:12.33]How?
[125:13.11]I've been correcting and punishing him for things.
[125:19.21]I've been the opposite of that for the last, like, at least 20 minutes with this guy.
[125:25.95]Okay, let's... Let's do that again.
[125:39.91]Give us like another eight defense.
[125:44.74]I think that's a failure.
[125:48.34]Yeah.
[125:49.16]Wait, is that success?
[125:50.08]Did he do it?
[125:50.70]Did he?
[125:50.96]Oh, come on.
[125:57.49]Minus three intelligence.
[126:08.15]What is he made out of?
[126:08.99]Rocks?
[126:12.38]Do it again.
[126:14.90]No cheating.
[126:17.53]I want shoes.
[126:18.51]I don't have enough money for shoes.
[126:21.87]Oh my god.
[126:23.95]Why do you want shoes?
[126:26.25]It's the Sonic the Hedgehog blooding him.
[126:27.77]That's what's doing that.
[126:36.06]I hope he wears them.
[126:36.74]Please have them on.
[126:40.43]See, you got what you want to know.
[126:41.51]Give me what I want.
[126:42.69]And that's 10 defense.
[126:46.08]Why'd I give it to him?
[126:46.76]Because, I don't know, he probably wouldn't do well in this competition here.
[126:52.68]Here we go.
[126:53.02]Leveled up defense.
[127:01.39]I'm running out of money.
[127:03.67]He seems well.
[127:04.45]I don't think that's enough.
[127:11.36]What's the next tournament?
[127:14.67]We have to try to enter him in here.
[127:15.75]Yeah, I know the intelligence keeps dropping, but we have to do that.
[127:29.99]His defense in life is so bad that... No, he failed.
[127:40.28]Don't scold him this time.
[127:44.73]Phoebe did not need bribes.
[127:46.51]He needed a bag of dirt to play with.
[127:54.06]Yeah, he didn't ask for expensive shoes.
[127:58.86]I want bones.
[127:59.70]I want shoes.
[128:00.90]I'm gonna cheat on everything.
[128:11.39]Come on.
[128:12.03]Courage says, I want to play with you next week.
[128:17.53]Sure.
[128:18.85]Courage, you can play next week.
[128:20.14]He wants a lot of stuff.
[128:25.38]This is three special requests.
[128:28.34]In a row.
[128:37.28]Alright, we're not going to do any more of this because I don't want to drop my intelligence anymore.
[128:46.64]What's this?
[128:48.96]Hey, Jeremy.
[128:50.52]I can't find Kura anywhere.
[128:53.77]I knew it was acting odd lately, but never thought it would.
[128:56.43]We got to find it.
[128:57.21]It'll report it to MRIs.
[128:58.61]He fucking took off.
[129:00.55]He got his shoes.
[129:02.09]He got his bones.
[129:03.65]He got his free stuff from dad.
[129:05.59]And then he takes the fuck off.
[129:08.23]He just swindled me out of my money.
[129:28.73]He's back.
[129:32.81]Where did you go?
[129:39.45]He just took off for like three weeks.
[129:41.11]The tournament's coming up.
[129:42.05]I was supposed to train him.
[129:43.33]Oh, we've missed the fucking tournament.
[129:44.93]I'm not gonna, I don't have any money.
[129:46.17]Get, get in, get over here.
[130:02.80]Kura says, I want meat.
[130:04.92]I don't have the fucking money for this.
[130:11.00]I can't do that.
[130:11.96]Oh, I see.
[130:15.42]Don't be willful.
[130:27.49]Where did he get this from?
[130:28.29]Where did he get this behavior from?
[130:29.31]Plus 12 power, that's what I'm talking about.
[130:32.97]It's alright to lose a little speed.
[130:40.22]Who was the, uh... Who was the other person we fused with?
[130:46.40]Well, you have to have potatoes because I can't give you anything else.
[130:48.76]You have to win a tournament.
[130:56.59]He learned it from me.
[131:02.69]Tournament at the end of the month.
[131:04.13]We have to be ready for it.
[131:08.46]Yeah, you're stressed out.
[131:09.36]That's fine.
[131:11.74]You made a promise that you'll play.
[131:13.22]Well, are you going to play with him?
[131:14.84]Yes.
[131:16.22]Good.
[131:18.04]Is this the thing where you... the rock, paper, scissors thing that I still don't understand how to play?
[131:24.38]It's cold.
[131:24.78]It's proper weather for a snowball fight.
[131:28.21]Shall I explain how to play?
[131:29.55]I'm going to explain about the snowball fight.
[131:33.15]First, look for your monster by using the directional buttons.
[131:38.48]The arrow on the lower left of the screen will show you which direction your monster is.
[131:43.60]You can move sideways while still facing forward by using the L and R buttons.
[131:49.20]When you see your monster, press the circle button to change to the sight mode.
[131:55.28]When in the sight mode, take a sighting of the monster with the directional buttons.
[132:01.55]Throw a snowball in sight mode.
[132:03.89]But be careful because you cannot move in the sight mode.
[132:06.55]Also, you can hold a maximum of three balls at a time.
[132:10.77]It'll take time to collect another set of balls.
[132:14.15]The number that appears in the upper left is Jeremy's points.
[132:17.71]Do your best to try and beat Kira's points.
[132:20.13]Which will appear on the right side.
[132:24.46]Okay.
[132:26.96]So, we move left and right and we get into sight mode.
[132:40.96]This is fun for you?
[132:46.76]Got him.
[132:47.84]Do I need to let him win?
[132:48.80]I think I need to let him win, right?
[132:56.61]Well, he's terrible.
[132:57.45]This is what you wanted to do?
[133:00.77]He's getting in close.
[133:10.74]Come here!
[133:13.22]Oh, he got me a couple times.
[133:14.34]Nice!
[133:14.74]Good job!
[133:15.32]Good throw!
[133:19.38]He's catching up!
[133:20.08]He's catching up right now!
[133:21.16]I gotta hit him!
[133:24.69]Oh my god, he's coming!
[133:25.61]The comeback is gonna be real here!
[133:27.55]Don't get hit!
[133:29.05]He just jumped!
[133:30.37]Wow!
[133:30.89]That was close.
[133:38.67]Hey, you're so close.
[133:41.63]But you'll never be able to beat your daddy.
[133:48.38]He says to his spoiled child.
[133:53.86]He's very well.
[133:55.02]Good.
[133:55.66]We lost loyalty.
[133:56.56]That's fucking fantastic.
[134:08.37]I think he has enough power now where it shouldn't be an issue.
[134:15.64]Over 10?
[134:15.84]Yeah, there you go.
[134:17.18]Alright, 165 power.
[134:20.50]Life is alright, defense is okay.
[134:28.30]Rest him up and see where we are.
[134:29.54]I still don't think I want to do it.
[134:32.86]Only 20.
[134:34.26]Loyalty, that's not enough.
[134:35.34]Let me look at a big picture here.
[134:48.79]You have mail.
[134:49.35]Yeah, it's half off or whatever.
[134:50.79]I just can't afford it.
[135:00.23]He's very well.
[135:01.87]20 loyalty.
[135:09.12]I mean, it might be worth a shot.
[135:12.82]Let's do it.
[135:20.92]Bad loyalty, so, I mean, it's not like... Whatever.
[135:25.02]We need to win, like, one match.
[135:38.01]Let's win.
[135:44.67]Alright.
[135:46.02]Dog versus dog.
[135:48.44]Almost lost this last time.
[135:54.35]If his loyalty is bad, let him fight by himself.
[135:57.87]You know, that's a good idea.
[136:02.22]He still gets confused though, doesn't he?
[136:03.48]Let's pull it back.
[136:10.80]There we go.
[136:14.00]Let's do it again.
[136:19.63]Let's get the advantage.
[136:27.93]Taking that one hit though is just ayayay.
[136:33.77]This'll be a win.
[136:38.57]Let's try and ice him.
[136:48.43]Speed's an issue, defense... My defense is so not... I mean, you got speed and you have defense.
[136:53.93]When both of them are bad, that's a problem.
[136:58.97]So I think I'm gonna do defense.
[137:00.31]I'm gonna... Speed's good.
[137:03.04]Defense is better.
[137:05.68]The amount of times that you win a match based solely on attrition.
[137:11.00]Versus, oh, I hope I dodge this move!
[137:12.85]And if you get hit by it, you take a thousand fucking damage.
[137:14.71]You know what I'm saying?
[137:24.42]He'll be good.
[137:28.18]Opponent is high skill.
[137:35.85]He throws snowballs.
[137:36.93]That's why I wanted to have a snowball fight.
[137:38.25]It makes sense.
[137:43.99]I think we lost to this guy last time.
[137:46.91]He's just way... He's just much more balanced than we are.
[137:52.50]Could get lucky.
[137:54.22]I feel like we might not win this, though.
[138:00.56]As long as I keep my distance.
[138:03.10]Just try to stay back.
[138:03.82]Because he has no moves in medium or long range.
[138:10.16]I could just screw him over so bad and just play... Play defensively and play back.
[138:13.70]And if he gets too close, then push him away.
[138:21.44]He has so many guts, though.
[138:22.34]I gotta be careful.
[138:24.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[138:26.18]That's not good!
[138:26.86]Bye!
[138:29.30]Push him away.
[138:29.84]Get away, get away.
[138:34.37]Let's try to hit him with ice.
[138:45.00]No, no, no!
[138:45.80]Don't get confused!
[138:46.72]Stay the fuck away from him!
[138:51.27]Stucked off getting confused!
[138:56.61]We have to get a guaranteed hit.
[138:57.81]Did I?
[138:58.49]That's gonna be close.
[138:59.11]Yeah, I win.
[139:01.22]Okay.
[139:06.70]If you're gonna lose in stats, then you may as well try to avoid his moves completely.
[139:15.36]Still got him.
[139:20.37]That wasn't close.
[139:21.23]It could have been.
[139:37.59]It wasn't close.
[139:38.31]Jerma can't do math.
[139:39.35]What do you mean it wasn't close?
[139:41.55]I was just concerned because I did two confusions in a row and he hit me.
[139:45.88]So I'm like, hold on.
[139:47.78]I can't get hit again.
[139:48.56]It was going to be close.
[139:50.00]If I had taken one more hit, that would have been a completely different story.
[139:53.54]Wow.
[140:01.49]Wow.
[140:06.08]Oh, this is gonna be easy.
[140:09.34]Just... smash.
[140:10.80]Over and over again.
[140:12.91]Staying close!
[140:13.43]He doesn't get any fucking moves!
[140:14.41]He doesn't get any close!
[140:15.19]Look at this guy!
[140:15.69]This guy's got no moves!
[140:18.03]This guy's got no moves!
[140:29.70]Wow, you really chose the wrong things.
[140:32.76]This guy doesn't have any moves!
[140:34.02]Are you kidding me?
[140:44.35]Really?
[140:44.49]What are you gonna do?
[140:47.97]What are you gonna do?
[140:50.03]Yeah, you're gonna cycle through your two moves you have at medium range.
[140:53.21]What a bad parent you have.
[140:55.06]Alright, uh, what?
[141:03.40]Okay.
[141:04.60]Please.
[141:05.56]Sit down.
[141:10.36]This isn't a monster battle, it's just a dog killing a rabbit.
[141:19.65]Two HP come back, I would have... I would have ended the stream.
[141:25.41]And you know how I would have done that?
[141:26.39]I would have just Ctrl-Alt-Delete, Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
[141:29.40]That's an instant restart.
[141:32.78]Does that still work on Windows 10?
[141:34.36]If I do Ctrl-Alt-Delete, Ctrl-Alt-Delete, does that turn my computer off?
[141:49.66]This is dog V. dog here.
[141:51.04]This dog is not good, so we'll be fine.
[141:54.32]Try it.
[141:57.86]No, I already had to restart my stream once tonight.
[142:00.47]I'm not doing that again.
[142:03.25]We already had our technical nonsense like 30, 40 minutes ago.
[142:09.87]His intelligence is bad.
[142:10.95]His defense is good.
[142:11.73]Oh, this is a dinosaur.
[142:17.44]Snowball, I think, would be sufficient here.
[142:22.20]Either snowball or... No, I mean, pretty much anything.
[142:25.20]We'll try it.
[142:25.92]Stay... Just... Nope.
[142:27.38]Yep.
[142:27.66]Fuck that.
[142:28.08]Just stay back.
[142:34.29]Let's try a snowball, though.
[142:35.67]See how much damage it does.
[142:36.49]It's alright.
[142:45.28]Uh-oh.
[142:46.28]Well, good, he got confused too.
[142:49.72]Thanks.
[142:49.98]71% chance, how can you fucking miss that?
[142:53.73]70%, how can you miss that twice in a row?
[142:56.49]How can you, how's that possible?
[142:58.61]How, somebody tell, somebody get the, somebody get a scientist.
[143:00.71]Somebody get a fucking mathematician on the phone and ask him how, what's the, what's the chance that a 70-70-66 is gonna miss?
[143:08.47]What, somebody get him on the fucking phone.
[143:11.19]Unbelievable.
[143:16.72]Oh my god, give me a break.
[143:18.10]I gotta get up, get up there.
[143:19.40]Get over here.
[143:20.68]Oh my god, will you please do it?
[143:24.93]Do it again, now!
[143:25.55]Go, go, go!
[143:28.73]Fuck me.
[143:47.81]70% chance, 70% chance, 66% chance.
[143:48.61]Miss, miss, miss.
[143:49.47]That's so, ah.
[143:50.51]There's a 3% chance that happens.
[144:17.90]somebody's a nerd I think we still win though we tie with anybody we have to win this one yet somehow bb hits every slap I'm sad that bb is gone but you know what his legacy will live on don't worry
[144:48.53]You lost against the single opponent that the bunny won against.
[144:51.01]Yeah, because... Fucking math problems.
[144:57.01]The game was doing algebra in the background.
[145:01.87]See, that should make a lot of you guys... That's why people play the lottery.
[145:06.45]You know?
[145:07.77]Oh, there's only like a 2% chance you'll win.
[145:09.79]It's never going to happen.
[145:12.55]And then... And then you end up as a mustard dinosaur.
[145:16.09]And you win the lottery.
[145:19.38]Uh-oh.
[145:23.15]Is this going to happen?
[145:24.65]What's going on here?
[145:40.79]I think it's soft locked.
[145:42.05]When was the last time it saved?
[145:44.46]What did we save?
[145:44.96]No, come on, man.
[145:53.90]No.
[146:00.90]It's loading.
[146:01.76]I can hear it churning.
[146:03.46]I'm going to leave it alone for a second.
[146:15.87]Oh, you fucking little asshole.
[146:17.47]Come on.
[146:36.96]Come on.
[146:39.22]We're about to win a tournament here for the first time.
[146:41.22]Come on.
[146:59.39]Clean the disk.
[147:03.37]Oh, this is not.
[147:04.39]This is sad right now.
[147:05.87]This actually is sad.
[147:16.81]I'm gonna fuck it up.
[147:17.51]I'm gonna put in the Heart of Darkness CD right now.
[147:23.01]And it's gonna be like, what the hell is this?
[147:24.63]It's not gonna know what to do.
[147:25.97]And then I'm gonna put in the Monster Rancher 2 CD.
[147:31.88]Like, okay, you know when a baby, right?
[147:34.42]And the baby doesn't want to eat the peas, it wants the chicken.
[147:38.24]So you grind up the chicken, and you hold it in front of the baby's nose, and you're like, oh, here's the chicken, and then you put the peas in.
[147:42.82]You know what I mean?
[147:44.62]That's exactly what I'm doing.
[147:46.70]Oh, wait, here comes the airplane, chicken nugget.
[147:48.86]Nope, it was broccoli.
[147:50.74]Now run.
[147:51.14]Yes!
[148:02.97]Let's go.
[148:16.84]Don't fool around here, man.
[148:20.04]There it is.
[148:21.28]Well, what's he got for moves?
[148:23.00]In close, in close, close, close, close the gap, close the gap here.
[148:27.58]Ayaya.
[148:31.84]Stay far away.
[148:33.72]He can't hurt, but he can't touch.
[148:36.18]Come on.
[148:44.83]I'm gonna win this one by attrition.
[148:53.40]So far I've been able to stay back.
[148:54.52]He can't do anything.
[148:58.32]Good.
[149:02.52]Back it up.
[149:03.04]Back it up.
[149:03.51]Back it up.
[149:05.17]No!
[149:07.71]No foolery.
[149:08.65]No foolery.
[149:14.11]You better not fucking hit me twice.
[149:15.87]Thank god.
[149:21.08]Tournament won.
[149:23.14]We made $500 and got something else.
[149:29.52]I was giving him a pep talk behind the scenes.
[149:31.02]Yeah.
[149:37.85]That was close.
[149:39.89]We still don't have enough money to get a new move.
[149:42.63]Not that we need one.
[149:50.65]Four and one.
[149:51.39]Three.
[149:51.67]Okay.
[149:52.13]We...
[149:54.34]Yeah, that's it.
[149:54.72]We win.
[150:01.25]Good work!
[150:06.89]That's the face of somebody that's about to say, Did you take?
[150:10.94]Did you take the picture yet?
[150:14.14]Did you take it?
[150:15.90]Okay, did you take it yet?
[150:17.20]700 bucks.
[150:30.55]Eight fans.
[150:31.35]Nice.
[150:31.79]Now save the game before I have to do the old baby switcheroo.
[150:36.26]Yeah, we finally have money.
[150:51.01]I think he's learned a lesson.
[150:54.13]That's a pretty good lesson.
[150:55.91]Good work.
[151:01.51]Yes, you're gonna get praise for that.
[151:11.27]He loves meat, but sorry, but I can't afford it.
[151:13.71]You have to eat fish.
[151:23.40]Eat it up.
[151:30.90]Oh, this is... Come on, have this be... Oh no, this is going to be from... Okay, cool.
[151:37.74]I don't have enough money, though.
[151:43.69]Save it.
[151:49.09]Fish isn't me?
[151:49.67]Um, it is.
[151:56.94]New slot, just in case something goes horribly wrong.
[152:02.60]Let me just go to the bathroom.
[152:04.02]Let me pee and grab myself a drink.
[152:06.44]I'll be right back.
[152:10.04]I fucked up my desktop audio, so there's no sound here.
[152:14.48]But I will be back.
[152:15.70]You know what?
[152:16.02]Here, how about this?
[152:18.40]No, I can't even do it.
[152:19.15]Alright.
[152:19.95]See you in like two minutes.
[154:41.21]Alright, so now that I have you guys here, let's go ahead and do a poll.
[154:51.62]The stream's not over, don't worry.
[154:53.66]But I want to see, because this is the third Monster Rancher 2 stream in a row, and I plan on streaming tomorrow.
[155:02.07]So, do you want to continue to watch
[155:08.87]You want to continue our journey tomorrow is the question.
[155:11.77]And Monster Rancher 2.
[155:18.80]Here's your poll.
[155:25.46]This is for tomorrow.
[155:30.97]Other than that, if we don't do this tomorrow, then I'm sure... There's a lot of games that are coming out here.
[155:41.16]I don't really have any other plan at the moment.
[155:44.76]But if you want to keep seeing Monster Rancher 2, then let me know.
[155:51.04]While I have a bunch of people here, let's do a poll.
[156:00.90]Become full-time Monster Rancher streamer.
[156:03.31]Well, we're going to play... Monster Rancher 3 is going to happen.
[156:06.31]But that's not going to happen probably for a little while.
[156:09.49]Because after this week...
[156:12.80]I'm putting the PlayStation 1 away for a little while.
[156:15.94]Or even the PlayStation 2.
[156:17.38]Old consoles are going away for like a couple weeks.
[156:29.97]No, 4?
[156:30.69]I mean, Monster Rancher 4... It depends.
[156:33.97]I don't know.
[156:34.27]It depends on how interested we still are in the series after we play the next game.
[156:46.62]Looks like... Looks like you guys want to continue to see it.
[156:52.58]So we'll close out the week tomorrow.
[156:54.14]We'll play Monster Rancher 2 again tomorrow.
[157:03.33]And then after tomorrow, old games are taking a backseat.
[157:08.25]I talked about this yesterday, but A Way Out's coming out.
[157:10.41]Far Cry 5 is coming out.
[157:12.87]Those are all coming out soon.
[157:16.76]But I'm totally okay with that because I'm having a lot of fun.
[157:18.62]I think these are great games.
[157:21.14]So we're going to be more ranching tomorrow.
[157:31.34]There we go.
[157:32.78]Thank you for participating.
[157:35.05]Appreciate it.
[157:36.57]Back to ranching.
[157:42.44]You said you'd play Garfield's card.
[157:43.70]I have to buy Bar... I have to go buy Barfield's card, okay?
[157:47.10]The game where you boff!
[157:51.43]So.
[157:53.03]Monster.
[157:54.55]Skill, power, life.
[157:56.21]Life and defense is still important.
[157:59.95]Let's get to 200 power.
[158:01.55]Let me see.
[158:06.73]Power and...
[158:09.53]Let's do this.
[158:10.13]Power and life.
[158:10.77]We'll drop a little speed.
[158:11.79]It's alright.
[158:13.57]We need more power.
[158:14.48]I want to have at least 200 to 300 power on this guy.
[158:17.80]Everything has to be balanced.
[158:18.72]We saw what happened with Baby Sonic.
[158:22.98]Having a bunch of speed is great, but if somebody touches you, it's awful.
[158:27.45]You've got to be balanced.
[158:37.27]I'm doing well.
[158:43.18]200, 200.
[158:44.22]Intelligence should come up a little bit here.
[158:45.77]And defense.
[158:50.73]No, don't list.
[158:55.41]Defense and life.
[158:57.85]Speed and intelligence.
[158:59.30]I could do this, but I lose a little bit of power.
[159:01.44]A little bit of cilantro.
[159:03.22]Let's do defense.
[159:07.14]Defense.
[159:14.11]Hmm?
[159:15.29]You want meat right now?
[159:16.42]No, dude.
[159:29.47]Whack.
[159:31.17]He made it.
[159:35.47]Am I still using a bootleg Digimon?
[159:43.29]What's wrong with this?
[159:45.39]Look.
[159:46.61]He has good moveset.
[159:50.98]Once he gets a little bit higher power, he will be good DNA food for somebody else.
[159:59.64]Let's do defense again.
[160:07.54]Yeah.
[160:07.90]Swim.
[160:08.28]Do a swim.
[160:11.51]Get it right.
[160:16.65]Yes!
[160:21.37]Yeah, the whole point of this guy is to become DNA food.
[160:33.96]You want... Fine.
[160:35.00]Here you go.
[160:36.14]Take some meat.
[160:36.80]Take all of Dad's money and go spend it at the finest steak restaurant you can find.
[160:41.10]Eat it.
[160:45.28]And just like that, broke again.
[160:53.25]You could sell them too, but Sonic was only worth 400 bucks.
[161:00.37]Can you explain how DNA works?
[161:01.74]Sure.
[161:03.76]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[161:04.44]Never mind.
[161:06.18]So we're gonna go to... We're gonna do it again.
[161:10.20]Last time, I'm not gonna drop intelligence again after this.
[161:25.90]Scald him.
[161:31.36]Weak parenting skills.
[161:32.92]Excuse me.
[161:34.46]Excuse me.
[161:40.13]Courage says, I want meat.
[161:42.71]I just gave it to you.
[161:48.67]I just gave it.
[161:49.39]He just had it.
[161:56.04]You shouldn't have eaten the whole steak.
[162:03.76]Alright, that's the last time, because I don't want to drop below 100 intelligence.
[162:13.55]So does it pass down its best skills, or what?
[162:17.01]Um...
[162:18.89]I'm not sure it passes down skills, I think it just gives the next tier of the next generation better base stats, from my understanding.
[162:28.93]And I think it starts off with better moves that you don't have to go learn, right?
[162:34.33]Okay, go take a break.
[162:42.61]Beanbag Sonic was happy with dirt.
[162:45.56]You can't have a perfect child every time.
[162:48.88]Right?
[162:52.18]It's like... Okay, let's talk about this.
[162:55.80]Okay, so like Galileo's brothers.
[162:59.94]Right?
[163:01.48]Would we talk about those guys?
[163:05.64]What about like... Any of the most popular, most intelligent scientists' sister?
[163:12.99]You know what I mean?
[163:13.77]Let's just... Okay.
[163:19.01]Like Galileo's brother didn't know shit about the stars.
[163:23.17]He was like a steel worker.
[163:26.49]You can't have two Galileos in a row.
[163:28.59]And if you do, you're fucking good luck.
[163:30.17]You got lucky.
[163:30.71]You scratched off that 2% scratch ticket.
[163:34.00]You get that 2% chance.
[163:36.72]You get the same amount of chance as the rest fat in that milk.
[163:44.87]Wait, we got some bananas here?
[163:49.76]I kind of want to do E again.
[163:53.14]He's not ready for D. Let's do E again.
[164:01.57]After this... No.
[164:06.05]He's not ready for D. I really, truly believe that.
[164:11.84]Let's do... What does he need?
[164:19.67]You need speed and defense.
[164:23.05]Speed, defense, and life.
[164:28.98]I said I wasn't gonna do this, but I'm gonna do it again.
[164:41.31]Need some more fame.
[164:48.88]Level down intelligence, but sorry we can go do it right now Which food you want to give him we're gonna give him a cup of jelly have I still not peeled off The last thing to peel off It's a waterlogged brain
[165:22.53]Ugh.
[165:27.55]Training list.
[165:29.32]Let's just do an intelligence training just to get it back up there.
[165:33.08]Go study.
[165:42.31]I don't understand.
[165:42.93]Hey, he did it.
[165:46.37]Look at that.
[165:46.97]Back up to 105.
[165:52.68]Talking about me or the dog?
[165:53.78]That's funny.
[165:56.56]That's funny.
[165:57.80]No ways you do want to see.
[166:05.78]He needs more health and defense.
[166:07.86]It's so low.
[166:12.85]I'm going to get one hit killed by one of these giant rock monsters.
[166:21.31]Hey, see you later, Avril.
[166:22.60]Thanks for sticking around.
[166:27.52]Why am I getting a plus one for this?
[166:34.39]Why can't you sit there and just spam training until he gets good stats?
[166:36.87]You could.
[166:38.57]But you're going to run out of money.
[166:41.17]And he needs to rest.
[166:42.73]He needs to... He'll never learn another move.
[166:48.70]They only learn new moves if you send them on the $2,000, $1,000 training missions.
[166:55.46]So you could do that, but then they get old.
[166:57.73]And when a monster gets like 3 to 5 years old, they die.
[167:05.75]Corey Gaming, I'm going to get a burger real quick.
[167:07.55]You want anything?
[167:08.03]Yeah.
[167:12.48]Give me a large fry.
[167:16.28]Something about.
[167:18.02]Funny about bald, right?
[167:26.92]Rest.
[167:32.44]Yeah, just one.
[167:33.94]Just one gigantic McDonald's fry.
[167:36.46]I'm going to cut it like a meatloaf.
[167:41.10]So here we go running out of running out of money.
[167:47.59]I think he has to participate in tournament now.
[167:57.39]He's stressed out.
[168:00.35]He's stressed out, but he's very well.
[168:01.73]I could try this.
[168:10.77]No, I'm not going to do it.
[168:12.33]Make sure he's ready.
[168:13.79]It's not worth it.
[168:19.76]I want to play with you next week.
[168:21.15]You want to throw some more snowballs?
[168:23.03]Absolutely.
[168:27.55]Give him mint?
[168:28.21]I don't have any mints and I don't have enough money to buy a mint.
[168:32.83]I would.
[168:33.77]I really would.
[168:38.57]152 health.
[168:39.03]Yeah, it's not winter anymore.
[168:43.05]Now we're going to throw rocks.
[168:50.35]Yes, let's play.
[168:55.77]$10 says he's gonna run away again.
[169:01.57]Um... Are we actually gonna throw rocks at each other?
[169:05.57]Yeah, please do.
[169:07.10]I'm gonna explain about the mud ball fight.
[169:08.48]Okay.
[169:28.32]You see, first you pick up the nearest rock.
[169:40.50]We really are throwing rocks.
[169:45.88]This is making me kind of sick.
[169:55.74]Wow, what a terrible throw that was, dude.
[170:01.92]Back it up.
[170:07.15]Nah, you can't throw for shit.
[170:11.75]Good jump, though.
[170:20.64]Questionable playtime.
[170:23.68]What, you guys, when you were kids, you never played this game?
[170:26.58]Whip rocks at each other?
[170:31.73]First person in the hospital loses?
[170:33.31]Hey, you won.
[170:52.24]Through we threw pine cones.
[170:54.04]I remember I Mean obviously that's a terror.
[170:56.78]Don't play that game.
[170:57.50]We were just joking, but I remember There's this big crab It was a big crabapple tree down the street from my house and I don't know why it was there.
[171:09.73]It's like why just pull it up.
[171:11.25]You can't eat crabapples.
[171:12.41]Can you eat crabapples?
[171:15.15]What is it?
[171:15.49]What is a crabapple?
[171:20.33]A crabapple safe to eat
[171:25.64]Crab apples might give you a sore stomach if you eat a few.
[171:28.80]But they're not gonna poison you, apparently.
[171:30.16]But what a pointless, stupid thing to have in your front lawn, right?
[171:35.57]So these people had a crab apple tree!
[171:39.57]Cut it down!
[171:40.13]What is it there for?
[171:42.55]They were only there- Crab apple's only purpose, when I was younger, was to pick one off and throw at one of your friends.
[171:50.77]Right?
[171:51.09]Like, that's the only purpose.
[171:52.33]It wasn't for food.
[171:54.36]But I remember anyways, I was walked home from the bus stop.
[171:58.66]And that was just the thing that like a bunch of people did.
[172:00.64]You would just be walking by and you'd hear like, and there'd be four or five crab apples broken around you.
[172:06.16]And you're like, oh God, somebody's like throwing apples at me.
[172:08.17]Someone's throwing fucking crab apples at me.
[172:10.37]Oh, it's alright.
[172:10.91]That's normal.
[172:12.41]And then you'd turn around and you'd be like, who was that?
[172:14.05]Hey, screw you, man.
[172:16.62]Then they'd be, like, laughing, like, running away.
[172:19.14]And then, like, they walk to the same spot, and you, like, try to do it to them, too, and you... It's a never-ending cycle of crab apples.
[172:30.75]Those things fucking hurt, by the way.
[172:34.27]I remember getting a crab apple off my back, like, the swell of my back.
[172:38.47]And it was like getting shot with a paintball gun.
[172:41.45]It was like, God damn it!
[172:44.62]Have you ever gone paintballing before?
[172:46.34]Why?
[172:47.00]I've been there like two or three times.
[172:48.96]Not fun.
[172:51.62]I told you the story already.
[172:52.60]I was the guy that bought the protective dress to make it so it didn't hurt.
[172:57.34]You know, the undercoating of armor?
[173:01.95]I was like, nah, I don't want to get... I don't like that.
[173:05.33]And then I got shot in the neck with a paintball.
[173:13.63]It sucked.
[173:18.68]Like those gardener clothes.
[173:22.08]Yeah, you look like a gardener.
[173:28.82]Yeah, paintball.
[173:29.64]Alright, explain it to me, right?
[173:31.02]So paintballing is just laser tag that hurts.
[173:38.88]I want to play with you next week.
[173:40.02]You play too much.
[173:55.67]Laser tag in a garden.
[173:57.03]There we go, 160.
[174:08.92]We're gonna go throw rocks at each other again.
[174:14.68]Paintball has stakes to it?
[174:15.98]I'm gonna call bullshit there.
[174:17.20]You know why?
[174:19.92]Because... Paintball works on the honor system.
[174:24.68]You understand?
[174:26.45]So when you and I play paintball, and you get hit, you're supposed to go, oh, I'm hit, I'm out.
[174:32.67]No, that doesn't ever happen, okay?
[174:34.39]You can hit the same guy five times with paintballs, and he's not gonna leave the arena.
[174:38.93]He's playing with like five of his dickhead friends.
[174:40.75]You think they're gonna, oh, sorry guys, I got hit, I'm leaving.
[174:44.97]It works by the honor, and there's a referee.
[174:46.65]There's referees in paintball.
[174:47.69]There's two, and there's like two square miles of land to cover.
[174:51.89]You're not gonna see everybody.
[174:56.67]Paintball is immutable.
[174:58.63]I mean, not paintball.
[175:00.13]Lasertag is immutable.
[175:02.21]It cannot be changed.
[175:04.07]It keeps track of every hit you ever take.
[175:06.87]You flash red when you get hit in Lasertag.
[175:10.92]And it keeps score.
[175:12.40]You can't lie.
[175:18.64]They have paint on them.
[175:20.16]Have you ever gone paintballing before?
[175:22.58]You have paint on you all day.
[175:25.07]You get hit by one paintball, that shit's gonna get smeared all over you for the course of the next six to twelve hours.
[175:29.87]Depending on how long you- twelve- no, like, four hours.
[175:39.82]Like, if- if- go paintballing, and then get hit by- over the course of, like, three or four games by, like, ten different paintballs, you- you're a mess.
[175:46.70]You- what are you gonna- you can't wipe it off, it's paint.
[176:02.59]You can block light?
[176:04.51]Okay, hold on, let me rebuttal that statement there.
[176:09.04]So you're saying I'm gonna cover up with my hands the sensors?
[176:14.92]Usually laser tech has sensor on the chest, sensor on the shoulders, sensor on the back.
[176:21.38]You need to use the laser gun.
[176:23.62]You can't aim by covering up your chest and aiming at the same... No, no, it's not gonna work.
[176:27.61]You need to have that precision aim.
[176:31.60]Duct tape?
[176:32.38]No!
[176:32.74]You can't bring duct tape into a laser tag establishment.
[176:35.78]That's not gonna happen.
[176:41.67]Unless you're playing with your friends in a non-established rule setting.
[176:45.41]Oh my god.
[176:56.55]Dude, I used to destroy people in laser tag.
[177:01.13]I was always at the top.
[177:02.59]You know when you go to the base in Lasertag?
[177:04.87]You go to the corners, and that's where the other team's base is, and if you shoot the base, you get some points.
[177:09.07]Oh, I would go up there and do that machine gun thing that I can do with a light gun, and they would think I was cheating.
[177:16.16]I would get pulled aside after matches and be like, hey, what's going on here?
[177:22.44]And I would just be like, I'd show my skills, and they'd be like, okay, man, alright.
[177:31.59]Oh, it's his birth- wait, wait, wait, it's his birthday.
[177:36.99]Me, me, me.
[177:39.99]Happy birthday.
[177:42.51]It's already his first birthday.
[177:43.81]We haven't done anything.
[177:46.78]Courageous.
[177:50.62]Grow and be a strong monster.
[177:55.08]That's such a terrible song.
[178:02.34]What an awful fucking song.
[178:03.92]But also, Happy Birthday is a terrible song, too.
[178:07.14]Think of that shitty song.
[178:09.70]Happy birthday to you.
[178:12.37]Happy birthday to you.
[178:15.15]Happy birthday, dear person's name.
[178:18.49]Happy birthday to you.
[178:20.63]That's awful.
[178:27.40]Happy Birthday's not copywritten.
[178:33.54]You can't copyright.
[178:34.47]That's in public domain.
[178:35.43]Mickey Mouse will be in public domain in like eight years anyways.
[178:39.11]Mickey Mouse will be selling used cars at your local shitty auto dealership in like ten years.
[178:44.87]Uh, apparently we're spoiling him.
[179:00.78]They've been saying that for like twenty years.
[179:06.17]38.
[179:06.93]What we got?
[179:09.71]Alright, 160, 180.
[179:12.65]Defense is still pretty lame, but it's okay.
[179:15.25]It's okay.
[179:17.61]We got a Gemini Cupcon up here.
[179:18.87]$2,000.
[179:18.91]We're going to enter this one.
[179:23.43]Let's get the defense up again.
[179:26.48]And we'll do Intelligence after this.
[179:37.24]Fucking failure.
[179:42.60]One year old?
[179:43.14]We gotta get to... Damn it.
[179:54.29]Do it again.
[179:55.17]This time, don't mess it up.
[180:00.17]What is this Facebook browser game?
[180:01.91]This is a PlayStation 1 classic, Monster Rancher 2, for the PlayStation 1 console.
[180:06.97]Entertainment System.
[180:10.29]It is a cult classic.
[180:20.08]Disney's the reason why copyright laws exist.
[180:22.46]He didn't want Mickey to be in public domain.
[180:26.99]Well...
[180:29.94]Hey, at least we got Frankenstein.
[180:32.92]Right?
[180:35.56]You know, you could have Frankenstein or the mummy sell your used cars for you.
[180:40.86]I'm sure they do.
[180:43.06]In fact, I'm certain they do.
[180:51.53]Cult classic equals shitty game.
[180:54.53]Whoa.
[180:54.87]Hold on a minute, man.
[180:58.13]What?
[181:01.16]That's... I am shocked and appalled by this.
[181:20.20]The Gemini Cup.
[181:23.50]Wasn't Mickey Mouse stolen from somebody else?
[181:27.13]Yeah, turd the mouse.
[181:34.85]washed up youtube let's player plays Facebook mobile game for four days straight it's only been three it's only been three that hasn't been four alright let's go get million
[182:00.05]Ooh, we certainly have leveled up since we last saw each other.
[182:04.30]Too bad it's for nothing, because I'm going to one-hit KO you.
[182:08.92]Like we said before, defense and life, doesn't matter how good your other stats are, this is a guaranteed loss for Millium.
[182:19.46]Guaranteed loss.
[182:21.51]In three, two, one.
[182:32.87]Action.
[182:51.74]Wow!
[182:55.10]Give me a break!
[182:57.52]Seriously, 88%?
[182:58.70]You're watching somebody get fucking totally, totally screwed over.
[183:09.37]Told you, guaranteed victory.
[183:13.23]I guarantee it.
[183:14.21]Just stay here.
[183:24.64]What the fuck is going on?
[183:30.37]It's okay.
[183:37.36]You know what?
[183:39.88]I would love to watch a speedrun of this game.
[183:43.00]To get to international champion.
[183:45.58]Does it exist?
[183:48.53]I'm not saying I'm going to do it.
[183:58.03]But that'd be interesting.
[184:01.33]I'm gonna sneeze.
[184:01.91]I'm just giving you some fair warning if you don't like hearing sneezes.
[184:04.73]And it grosses you out and it pisses you off.
[184:06.39]What is coming up?
[184:10.91]I wish I had the webcam on.
[184:12.66]Damn it!
[184:13.26]The one time the webcam should be on.
[184:16.48]Oh, that would have been so perfect for you guys to see that.
[184:18.28]I wish I could have rewind and see what it looked like.
[184:20.12]Oh well.
[184:24.34]Alright, this guy is pretty good.
[184:29.43]It's got high defense.
[184:31.91]We just kind of have to get, we have to get lucky.
[184:35.03]Which we know how well that goes though for us.
[184:39.82]Just stay back.
[184:49.89]Come on.
[184:51.37]Come on.
[184:52.71]You have to do that shit every fucking time.
[185:03.46]There it is.
[185:04.58]Now we're good.
[185:05.89]Pull it back.
[185:06.33]Right when it matters the most!
[185:12.88]Bounce him away.
[185:13.44]Bounce him away.
[185:33.92]That's enough out of you Nice
[185:48.76]Uh, foolery, if somebody's asking what the hell that means.
[185:51.50]Uh, depending on the loyalty of your monster, there is a chance that he just will not listen to one of your commands.
[186:01.33]Loyalty goes up to, I believe, 100.
[186:02.71]We are currently at about 40.
[186:09.03]I believe.
[186:14.74]I'm praising him too much.
[186:20.84]I just want to see what I look like right now.
[186:24.66]Okay, I just want to see what I look like.
[186:25.88]I'm just holding back another sneeze.
[186:30.36]It has like a sneeze and burp.
[186:31.66]Okay, Harimoa.
[186:34.13]This is... We've got to win this one.
[186:39.13]Is this game worth getting if you have a PlayStation 1?
[186:41.03]Yeah, totally.
[186:43.41]Ugly streamer.
[186:44.25]Skill 272.
[186:44.67]Alright.
[186:48.78]The speed's fine.
[186:49.88]Terrible defense.
[186:50.88]Terrible life.
[186:53.70]We just need to hit it with sure things and stay far away.
[186:59.88]This is the sure thing.
[187:01.34]70%.
[187:02.56]And go.
[187:02.88]Do it again.
[187:03.86]That was pretty much the same.
[187:07.44]Okay.
[187:14.78]He gets his 270%.
[187:17.94]Why don't you get them all?
[187:18.92]Get them all.
[187:20.30]You know, why don't you just keep it stunlocked the whole time?
[187:23.60]That'd be great.
[187:31.50]I'm gonna go with a 1-2.
[187:34.22]I needed to hit that.
[187:38.45]Good that we both fucked up.
[187:39.41]1-2, I need it.
[187:51.46]Dodge it!
[187:54.22]Come on, dude!
[187:55.28]Give me a break!
[187:57.93]Why can't I do a fucking move?!
[188:00.97]I've been spamming on X the whole time, but I couldn't do it.
[188:05.53]Give me a break.
[188:09.97]I'm sitting there, pressing X, and it doesn't matter.
[188:17.18]But I shucked up a fucking Yahtzee container and threw it on the ground and I lost.
[188:20.44]Great.
[188:31.96]That's such a... That's a bag of shit right there.
[188:33.98]It really is.
[188:43.91]I made it.
[188:44.25]It's at 1100 bucks.
[188:45.15]It's fine.
[188:47.49]And one person thought I was cool.
[188:55.01]Just needed to land a move and I just couldn't.
[189:00.57]I'm getting this motherfucker to 100 loyalty.
[189:02.41]I'm so sick of that happening.
[189:10.50]Did you learn something?
[189:12.44]Good.
[189:20.70]Lost to a flying squirrel.
[189:25.70]Here's that break.
[189:26.86]Let's go back to fish.
[189:34.55]And give us a opportunity to go train for cheaper, please.
[189:47.11]I lost to a Madagascar character and it was the worst one.
[189:54.61]Well, oh well.
[190:00.65]So our problems are in loyalty and speed.
[190:07.71]Pretty much everything.
[190:09.11]We need more of everything.
[190:11.69]Fuck intelligence at this point, man.
[190:13.40]I need more defense, life, and speed.
[190:15.18]I need everything.
[190:15.76]Just give me everything.
[190:16.46]Give me it all.
[190:16.96]I want it all.
[190:19.02]I'll do whatever it takes.
[190:22.80]You failure.
[190:23.74]God damn it.
[190:33.49]Mm-hmm.
[190:34.55]Yes.
[190:35.05]Perfect.
[190:35.33]Come on.
[190:37.57]Please tell me it's from the... It's from the item shop, isn't it?
[190:41.73]God damn it.
[190:43.28]No.
[190:43.58]Get in there.
[191:01.58]He's cheating.
[191:10.58]I lost so much intelligence for no reason.
[191:15.00]Cheated.
[191:15.92]Scald him.
[191:24.30]Okay, so we're even now.
[191:27.32]We have a... He's a well-trained, even monster.
[191:35.36]Oh, by the way, I have a...
[191:41.50]Happy St.
[191:41.88]Patrick's Day, everybody.
[191:47.61]I'm not doing the tournament.
[191:48.53]No 35 loyalty.
[191:50.05]Not gonna happen.
[191:52.83]We need more training.
[191:57.71]Speed intelligence.
[191:58.92]Lose power.
[191:59.74]Power in life.
[192:00.78]Lose speed.
[192:17.67]That's a lot.
[192:22.45]That's a lot.
[192:27.31]Fish it is.
[192:28.65]We need more speed.
[192:33.70]Proceeds to lower speed, but I got 15 power and I can get that back really easily.
[192:41.08]He's a little stressed out.
[192:44.66]I'm still even.
[192:47.82]I want him.
[192:49.36]We're skilled.
[192:58.31]Power in life.
[192:59.33]Intellect and skill minus defense.
[193:01.21]Let's just get skill up there for a little bit.
[193:07.04]Then he's going to go to bed.
[193:07.86]Got it.
[193:14.61]Look at that tail wag.
[193:17.83]Okay.
[193:18.23]Well, that was a lot.
[193:19.91]That was... And that was an insane amount.
[193:25.43]Who the fuck are you?
[193:26.21]Quack, quack.
[193:28.53]What is it?
[193:28.97]Joy?
[193:33.77]What a beautiful flower.
[193:35.47]Where did you get this?
[193:38.29]I stole it.
[193:39.97]This is for me.
[193:41.56]Thank you, Cura.
[193:45.01]This dog, like... Where's my flower?
[193:57.98]He's huge now.
[193:58.94]Look at how big he is.
[193:59.62]Let's give him a mint.
[194:08.54]Beautiful flower.
[194:16.62]Sale's still going on here.
[194:19.54]Sale's not going on anymore.
[194:22.44]Shit.
[194:31.45]Now don't use the flower.
[194:36.97]Eat it.
[194:37.99]Get your stress level down, please.
[194:46.03]Alright, what about loyalty food?
[194:50.85]Bye.
[194:52.79]Star prune.
[194:57.48]Nut oil.
[194:59.96]Sour jelly.
[195:04.16]Apple cake.
[195:04.76]Use it to reward your monster.
[195:08.03]Smoked snake.
[195:09.49]Candy.
[195:10.71]Which one gives loyalty?
[195:14.38]The cake?
[195:15.64]That's too much money.
[195:16.40]I can't... Fatigue.
[195:21.66]I don't have enough money.
[195:23.18]Let's do skill again.
[195:34.27]Mango?
[195:37.95]Nice.
[195:43.48]What's the... Alright, we, um... I'm gonna just... I'm gonna spam the absolute hell out of this.
[195:50.39]I'm getting 14, 15 two times in a row here.
[195:56.72]I'll do this to 300.
[195:57.34]That's a lot.
[196:05.94]Very well.
[196:13.43]Extract the loyalty oil.
[196:16.65]Because this is by far the biggest bang for the buck.
[196:25.64]We could get this to over... We could get this to potentially 400.
[196:37.17]Is the flower a DNA item?
[196:38.29]It might be.
[196:47.62]He's doing well, same thing.
[196:50.12]Let's get this to at least 300.
[196:54.89]Get it to 500?
[196:55.49]You want us to be one of those just psychos that can't miss?
[196:58.77]And have 500 in one stat?
[197:00.33]I mean... That's not that hard to get if I can continue to do it like this.
[197:05.41]That's insane.
[197:13.94]Okay, save the game.
[197:14.96]Good call.
[197:16.83]Thank you for reminding me.
[197:23.94]Do it again.
[197:32.32]Dropping frames again, but it's okay.
[197:44.51]Yeah, I'm gonna do this to 300.
[197:45.81]And then we'll put him in the next tournament.
[197:49.31]Maybe do a little bit more power.
[197:59.81]Massive gains.
[198:04.49]Dropping frames, gaining skill.
[198:06.55]Mm-hmm.
[198:06.73]Uh-oh.
[198:11.67]I think we hit... Do we hit diminishing returns?
[198:16.11]Let him rest.
[198:17.29]And then we got... This is the official tournament right here.
[198:20.85]We're going to enter this one.
[198:28.71]When did we get the purple boy?
[198:29.72]A couple hours ago?
[198:33.32]Like two and a half hours ago or so?
[198:39.26]Money is getting tight, but we should get it back.
[198:41.70]Let's give him... Let's give him meat.
[198:45.50]Because we should win this tournament here if we get these skills high enough.
[198:59.15]At the end of the month, that means we do three trains, and then two trains of rest, and that's it.
[199:05.05]Oh, goddammit, really?
[199:09.00]Item shop?
[199:10.76]No.
[199:13.32]That's unfortunate.
[199:17.94]Fuck, I'm spoiling him now.
[199:19.74]I don't have enough money.
[199:28.41]Don't miss.
[199:34.83]Wait a second, two and a half hours ago?
[199:35.97]You've been streaming for one and a half hours!
[199:37.90]We had technical problems.
[199:40.74]My computer was a piece of shit.
[199:42.70]No, it wasn't.
[199:43.14]Twitch's ingest servers were screwed up.
[199:46.10]So I had to restart the stream.
[199:48.34]Alright, now that I'm over 300 skill... Oh boy, is he dumb.
[199:54.37]We need to do intelligence just to get it up to level 3.
[199:59.27]And then I'd say probably power.
[200:00.93]So we're going to do intelligence and then power.
[200:03.71]What day is it?
[200:08.04]Power, sleep, tournament.
[200:10.84]You got it.
[200:18.40]Don't cheat.
[200:19.05]No, don't cheat!
[200:23.65]Why does he always cheat on this one?
[200:27.77]At least it got to 200.
[200:33.23]Yes, Scaldin, that's not cool.
[200:35.22]Stop doing that.
[200:40.19]He's well.
[200:44.23]Rest.
[200:45.95]And then let's enter the tournament.
[200:55.27]Official tournament.
[200:56.05]He seems to be in shape.
[201:00.42]He's very well.
[201:04.22]Save it.
[201:16.90]Let's enter the official tournament for $6,000.
[201:21.55]Go.
[201:27.61]Execute him for cheating.
[201:28.55]Official cup degrade.
[201:40.59]Alright, who's next?
[201:43.15]We've got a huge amount of skill now.
[201:44.98]Our hit percentage should be insane.
[201:47.46]We have two S moves.
[201:50.96]This should not be that much of a problem.
[201:55.80]This guy's all about zoning and getting the sure hit and then making sure you don't get hit by anything.
[202:02.79]Give it a try.
[202:05.59]Okay, so... Yes.
[202:08.23]Yes.
[202:10.08]He's pretty balanced.
[202:11.54]But we should hit more than him.
[202:15.27]Theoretically.
[202:16.23]Because we have more speed and more skill.
[202:18.65]And we hit harder.
[202:19.45]And we have more health.
[202:21.49]You know?
[202:22.47]That's how it just should work.
[202:44.35]Back it up.
[202:46.59]I'm gonna hunt him back.
[202:49.85]He has no moves that are far away.
[202:53.11]Just play the slow game.
[203:01.18]He can't even spend any of his guts.
[203:07.44]Camera, where are you going?
[203:13.50]It's pretty much an unbelievably unbeatable defense here.
[203:16.38]Good thing I didn't get hit by that.
[203:20.06]Say that one more time.
[203:25.85]Yeah.
[203:30.93]Flawless.
[203:34.47]Yeah, we'll do... We got skill now.
[203:35.79]Now we're going to do power.
[203:37.61]If I can train power, I will.
[203:40.61]By air entry, I'll do it.
[203:49.50]The biggest problem is going to be a guy like that.
[203:52.03]The weird human face dog.
[203:59.11]Now, Winston is the loser.
[204:04.34]Do you want to give advice?
[204:06.88]Yes, I do.
[204:07.80]Let's go.
[204:16.60]Sleet sucks?
[204:17.44]Yeah, but he has a ton of... Wow.
[204:22.21]How do you keep getting into tournaments?
[204:25.91]You know what I mean?
[204:27.89]How does this keep happening to you?
[204:39.14]Don't even let him get a chance.
[204:39.98]Alright, that's fine.
[204:47.09]Ooh, seven damage!
[204:48.19]Uh-oh.
[204:50.29]Alright, I'm kind of stun-locked here.
[204:55.87]No, that's it.
[204:58.90]It's over.
[205:02.56]Scratch him.
[205:03.04]Just scratch his eyes out.
[205:06.18]Alright, finish it with an Ice Pump.
[205:13.29]No, don't get cocky.
[205:14.15]Just win.
[205:26.56]Don't make jokes here, don't laugh.
[205:28.16]It's possible I could just lose this if I don't do this good enough.
[205:36.51]Slapped for one damage.
[205:40.62]Yeah, man, I mean, I would... I would just cut off those three heads and make like a fucking salad.
[205:50.37]Take them out back.
[205:51.33]Chop off the three heads.
[205:53.90]Add a little bit of arugula.
[205:55.50]Some cherry tomatoes.
[205:57.76]And have yourself a nice little green salad.
[206:01.10]It's almost impossible to lose that thing, yeah?
[206:23.43]Vegan streamer.
[206:24.19]Alright, who are we going up against?
[206:25.47]I don't even know.
[206:27.58]Don't even matter.
[206:34.46]Plants are alive?
[206:35.36]No, they're not.
[206:35.68]They don't even have a circulatory system.
[206:39.76]Alright, this guy's got no life, no defense.
[206:41.92]He has got no life.
[206:44.82]No power.
[206:46.77]He does have a lot of speed, but I got a lot of skill.
[206:49.33]So, sorry.
[206:50.63]Hand covers rock.
[206:52.13]Deckhead.
[206:58.16]Let's get a 1-2 in here.
[207:00.66]Hold on, I gotta change it.
[207:08.28]I gotta hit that.
[207:08.76]I could probably kill him with that.
[207:11.73]Pack it up.
[207:14.57]Bingo.
[207:15.09]See ya later.
[207:17.65]I think this is gonna be a tournament victory.
[207:29.00]Sleep Bomb has... Well, actually, that's not true yet.
[207:32.60]We have to beat Sleep Bomb.
[207:37.41]I actually really hope that Sleep Bomb loses here.
[207:40.21]Because we've beaten Millium twice before.
[207:43.59]Ooh, that's too bad.
[207:47.49]Ooh.
[207:50.47]Shoot.
[207:55.74]Well...
[207:58.58]Okay.
[208:04.86]I demand more jupes.
[208:11.22]Again, looks can be deceiving.
[208:14.77]We just have to hit.
[208:15.75]We gotta get one good hit and it's over.
[208:19.23]That means just fall back here and just bingo.
[208:21.43]There it is.
[208:24.93]Getting right in the middle here.
[208:28.40]And then a one-two punch, that should be the end of the whole match.
[208:31.08]Get in here.
[208:33.32]I'll get it right now.
[208:34.04]One, two, three.
[208:35.70]No.
[208:38.08]Too slow.
[208:41.54]No, you just dropped my guts down.
[208:43.66]God, you're ripping out my guts!
[208:48.88]I would boo too.
[208:55.82]You just blew me three kisses and I killed you.
[208:58.82]Why are you in this tournament?
[209:01.66]And how did you win two other times?
[209:04.08]Three other times.
[209:06.22]Whatever it was.
[209:06.70]Alright, here we go.
[209:13.64]Come on, Sleep Bomb.
[209:14.32]Lose.
[209:18.99]God damn it.
[209:21.71]We gotta play well against Sleep Bomb.
[209:24.49]This is not gonna be good.
[209:26.82]This is for the tournament.
[209:29.44]What does he have?
[209:29.84]He's got high defense, right?
[209:32.34]High life.
[209:35.57]Well, let's try it.
[209:47.07]He's got a ton of power.
[209:49.37]Oh, his intelligence is awful.
[209:50.91]His skill is awful, too.
[209:54.23]We just have to... Mmm...
[209:57.96]It might be worth actually just using the Intelligence moves.
[210:01.66]Let's try it.
[210:04.94]Maybe just Ice Bomb him.
[210:07.92]Yeah.
[210:08.06]I'm gonna play Ice Bomb, I'm gonna keep away from him.
[210:12.33]Alright.
[210:15.17]Back it up.
[210:18.83]Dodge it!
[210:19.51]Nice.
[210:23.99]Not doing damage anymore.
[210:26.21]Stay back.
[210:27.46]Get Guts.
[210:27.98]Don't let him spend any moves.
[210:29.08]Stay back.
[210:29.48]We don't want to get hit by any of this shit.
[210:35.76]Don't let him every time you get a chance.
[210:37.18]Here we go.
[210:41.54]Back it up.
[210:45.78]It might look like we're winning, but all it takes is one, dude.
[210:50.87]He hits us one time.
[210:58.19]Five... Four... Three... That should be it.
[211:04.36]Flawless.
[211:04.70]Good.
[211:05.10]Good go.
[211:06.50]I just said, good god.
[211:09.74]Moving up to C. That's a good amount of money, too.
[211:27.91]Okay.
[211:28.71]There you go, Palmer.
[211:32.11]Palmer won.
[211:33.73]Palmer won three times.
[211:37.96]Out of all these monsters, Palmer's gonna get like 500 bucks.
[211:43.36]Came in third place.
[211:49.95]That's so terrible.
[211:59.69]Grade D.
[212:00.03]1,250.
[212:00.09]And fans?
[212:06.26]Wow.
[212:06.36]A lot of fans.
[212:26.60]Jesus, that thing is ugly up close.
[212:29.39]Yes, it is.
[212:30.39]And now he's going to run away.
[212:36.31]I think Korra has learned a lesson.
[212:40.89]Pretty much in everything I wanted him to learn, too, so that's good.
[212:45.33]He did a great job.
[212:46.07]No praising.
[212:50.42]He was soft before we started.
[212:51.52]1,500 gold.
[212:57.77]Stick with fish.
[212:59.63]No, actually, let's go Cup Jelly.
[213:06.40]You can't spoil him.
[213:09.10]We can't spoil him.
[213:10.20]We have to keep him on even.
[213:15.08]You getting more, like, love letters for my assistant hero?
[213:17.44]What are you doing?
[213:21.16]Yeah.
[213:23.71]Hey, that's...
[213:26.84]That's a gallo nut.
[213:29.98]You found it, thank you.
[213:33.72]Jeremy, you're also going to praise it, right?
[213:43.48]You didn't bring me shit!
[213:54.38]Even.
[213:58.99]even but Stephen understand even but Stephen take a rest bad dad no I'm not a bad dad we're trying to make it so he gets more than 50 loyalty
[214:29.10]He's run away once.
[214:29.94]12 and 4.
[214:35.28]He likes meat, doesn't like milk.
[214:37.00]He's skinny.
[214:37.76]Alright, we still have... I can't believe we have not been able to take him on one... One trip.
[214:48.80]To the Errantree.
[214:52.29]Good job, didn't cheat.
[214:57.25]Now let's get power to like 250.
[215:01.40]And speaking of none of those things.
[215:06.01]Now I'm going to pee one more time and we'll come back.
[215:08.60]Be right back.
[217:43.16]So the start time tomorrow for the live stream that you're currently watching, probably the same time that it was today.
[217:55.90]Actually, I have a couple of things I have to do tomorrow during the afternoon.
[218:01.26]But I would probably say between like kind of same thing between like seven to nine, probably start more closer to like eight or nine.
[218:10.65]Somebody's coming over here tomorrow and I need to be around.
[218:16.70]Let's go back to the game.
[218:22.42]Alright.
[218:24.23]Power, right?
[218:24.73]That's what we're trying to do.
[218:28.49]Power.
[218:31.91]8 or 9 Eastern.
[218:35.09]PM.
[218:39.44]Stream my errands?
[218:40.24]I'm not really doing errands.
[218:41.16]I'm having company tomorrow.
[218:54.43]He gets way more points in skill than he does in anything else.
[219:04.47]I'm running a comp- Yeah, I'm running a company tomorrow.
[219:12.28]Can I get a shout-out?
[219:13.30]Absolutely!
[219:13.96]Oh, anime!
[219:15.70]Nya!
[219:16.78]Nya!
[219:17.42]Thank you for the- Thank- Thanks for sticking around!
[219:22.37]See?
[219:24.29]Who else wants one?
[219:25.23]Who else wants a shout out?
[219:26.19]Anybody?
[219:27.92]Who wants a shout out?
[219:28.88]Somebody?
[219:29.18]Hey, Shadow Smasher!
[219:40.35]Shout out for you.
[219:41.01]Techno Toast!
[219:42.97]Who else wants a shout out?
[219:43.79]Anybody?
[219:45.27]RageGuy504, shout out!
[219:56.65]There it is!
[219:59.16]I'm being told by my producer.
[220:01.06]That's probably not a good idea, so... I'm getting in the earpiece.
[220:03.76]He's screaming at me.
[220:05.60]I'm being yelled at.
[220:08.34]Let's give him some fish.
[220:18.31]I got a new water filter.
[220:20.09]And damn is it awesome.
[220:25.08]That's it.
[220:26.52]That's the whole story.
[220:28.68]There's no funny story like, I didn't hook it up and it exploded and the water went everywhere.
[220:32.37]No, that's it.
[220:33.65]That's the whole story.
[220:47.92]Get to 250.
[220:49.76]So you can be worth a damn thing.
[220:57.25]A little tired.
[220:57.97]Give him a rest, you know?
[220:59.77]Give him a rest.
[221:02.85]How am I this poor five years into the game?
[221:05.67]Because we've changed monsters like three times.
[221:15.10]What's the next battle?
[221:17.58]Uh, this is just round robin.
[221:20.45]We can see if he gets lucky here and wins.
[221:22.63]Get some cash.
[221:25.51]Let's try it.
[221:26.13]I'm doing it.
[221:26.77]Let's go.
[221:27.47]Go for it.
[221:28.73]Just go for it, as they say, right?
[221:37.67]In the words of Toucan Sam.
[221:41.93]Follow your nose.
[221:42.97]Follow your dreams.
[221:45.62]That's what he really meant.
[221:46.26]That's what he was saying.
[221:46.92]Follow your nose.
[221:51.24]Sniff out some gross sugary cereal.
[221:54.62]that makes the milk taste like acid after five minutes.
[222:03.73]Wait a minute.
[222:07.71]Uh, excuse me.
[222:09.79]KXE501, excuse me, just gave 5,000 bits.
[222:15.23]$50, thank you KXE, and they say bits for the bit gods.
[222:20.71]Thank you, dude.
[222:23.13]That's a lot of money.
[222:25.89]that you're giving me, all I can say is thank you so much.
[222:33.71]Now somebody make fun of me so I can stay even.
[222:37.69]Thanks, dude.
[222:38.95]You rock.
[222:39.25]That's a lot of fucking cash.
[222:46.95]It's against terms of service to use fiat.
[222:51.41]How do you say that?
[222:52.61]Is it fiat or fiat?
[222:55.68]Right?
[222:56.76]Is it Fiat?
[222:58.56]Isn't Fiat the car company that makes tiny little mouse clown cars?
[223:05.05]What company is that?
[223:06.23]That's Fiat, right?
[223:09.73]Terrible intelligence on this guy.
[223:18.03]So when somebody says Fiat, are they talking about the money or are they talking about the gerbil car?
[223:24.30]Let me look at this.
[223:25.38]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[223:28.22]Me and this guy have the same build, except his is way better.
[223:33.94]I have to get lucky with... I gotta get lucky with hits, and I'm gonna do intelligence moves here.
[223:42.58]Stay far away as well.
[223:45.58]Now back it up.
[223:49.76]Oh!
[223:53.78]Stay back.
[223:54.20]Stay back.
[223:54.58]Stay back.
[223:54.90]Don't get that close.
[223:56.92]I can win this without having to KO him.
[224:07.26]He got in.
[224:07.73]He bridged the gap there.
[224:15.97]It's still possible.
[224:18.57]Come on, man.
[224:19.15]Give it back.
[224:21.98]Pull it back.
[224:22.78]Stay back here.
[224:25.12]Give me a fucking break, man.
[224:26.26]Give me a break.
[224:26.90]Really?
[224:33.26]No, that's not the time to be fooled.
[224:36.64]I still got it.
[224:37.16]Come on, stay back.
[224:38.70]Pull it back.
[224:39.22]Don't let him close the gap.
[224:40.14]It's gonna be close.
[224:42.85]That's it.
[224:49.47]Got it.
[224:54.92]Oh yeah.
[224:57.35]Did you ever do a third Monster Hunter stream?
[225:01.75]A Monster Hunter?
[225:02.69]Uh, no.
[225:04.21]I played almost all that game off-stream.
[225:11.56]It was a very good game.
[225:17.84]Just had to be away from it.
[225:19.76]See, here's the good thing.
[225:22.00]All jokes aside, for real.
[225:25.24]Having those long-range moves at the very start of the game, you can just zone people.
[225:33.68]Because if I had like a... These guys don't have more than two moves.
[225:37.72]Or three moves sometimes.
[225:41.62]So that DNA scramble we did, giving me the ice snot and the charge, makes me win half these.
[225:50.85]I would have lost a majority of these.
[225:54.42]Okay, but for instance, we gotta be careful, because we might need to be close on this one.
[225:59.78]Yeah, we gotta be in close.
[226:01.08]Pull it in.
[226:02.10]Pull it in close.
[226:05.70]That's fine.
[226:07.25]Get in there.
[226:08.41]Get up all in his business.
[226:09.79]Don't even give him a chance.
[226:14.45]Smoke breath.
[226:16.49]See, like, I don't know how he got in close there, but he did.
[226:20.47]I gotta take him down now, quick.
[226:24.67]Give me a break.
[226:25.25]Get in close.
[226:25.83]Don't!
[226:26.53]Right here, right here.
[226:31.28]No intelligence boost.
[226:37.54]God damn it.
[226:38.72]I needed to hit that.
[226:50.79]I'm getting kind of fucked here.
[226:58.52]That might have done it.
[227:02.92]Woo!
[227:03.50]That was close.
[227:16.25]He's gotta try to move around those INT moves.
[227:19.03]Because holy shit, if he hit me with one of those... I would have been at least 40 or 50 damage and I would have lost.
[227:26.11]Now we're in a position to win the game.
[227:28.51]And a lot of money.
[227:33.82]So that puts us now... We win this.
[227:38.94]We win gold.
[227:40.52]Am I going to play Monster Rancher 3 or 4?
[227:49.73]Absolutely.
[227:52.27]Monster Rancher 3 is on the cards.
[227:56.37]Now this one in particular might be hard.
[228:04.60]This is gonna hurt.
[228:08.56]All I can hope here is that I can zone him.
[228:12.88]I can't.
[228:15.06]Gotta get lucky.
[228:20.35]He's got so much health.
[228:25.41]I think he can heal too, can't he?
[228:31.78]That was huge.
[228:33.22]One more time.
[228:33.60]Do it again.
[228:34.06]Land it again.
[228:34.54]Come on.
[228:35.66]Oh, that was huge.
[228:36.92]Two huge hits.
[228:40.60]He can only eat a banana right now.
[228:43.66]Which, I don't know what the hell that even does.
[228:52.01]Yeah, he can eat the banana.
[228:53.25]That's all you can do, buddy.
[228:56.57]I will stay back here.
[228:58.67]While you just eat food.
[229:03.97]Yeah, I'll be putting in work back here while you do a social eating stream.
[229:10.40]No cockiness, just keep it.
[229:12.46]That was cocky, but you know, it's okay because I got enough food again.
[229:15.08]I will.
[229:26.72]That was dumb.
[229:35.29]Cocky streamer.
[229:38.64]Nothing wrong with a social eating stream.
[229:40.92]I told you guys what I was going to do, but I just didn't do it.
[229:44.43]I was going to get one of those huge dome jellos.
[229:46.48]The huge ones that you bring to a party.
[229:48.44]That nobody brings to a party.
[229:50.20]They just happen to be there.
[229:52.02]By the way, that's only in cartoons and movies.
[229:54.14]But I was going to get the movie jello globe and eat it.
[229:57.64]Silently.
[229:59.10]That was the joke.
[230:00.52]Good thing I didn't do it.
[230:04.06]I probably got a lot of fans for this.
[230:12.82]The Mandy Cup.
[230:18.64]Oh boy.
[230:20.30]Good.
[230:21.06]We're no longer broke.
[230:22.24]And we got new disk chips.
[230:27.25]And... How much fame did the monkey get?
[230:34.34]I wanna know.
[230:36.20]I wanna know what that guy got for eating on stream.
[230:39.44]What did I get for Flawless-ing everybody in the tournament?
[230:41.64]Three.
[230:48.98]Please.
[231:00.02]You beat up a monkey eating lunch.
[231:02.26]What did you expect?
[231:05.58]More than three.
[231:11.10]Good job.
[231:20.82]For the first time ever, I've seen more than 52 loyalty.
[231:23.78]Probably shouldn't have praised him there.
[231:26.30]Alright, so should I just hoard my money?
[231:30.89]What do we got coming up?
[231:32.29]The next B cup.
[231:36.91]We get a Lorax for a prize.
[231:38.40]This is the official one.
[231:43.04]This is 8.
[231:45.46]I'm not ready for it.
[231:46.74]We need to train.
[231:54.77]Take a much-deserved rest.
[231:59.69]Save some money.
[232:03.13]Can anything bad happen if you have very high loyalty?
[232:05.27]I don't think so.
[232:12.84]Always fish.
[232:13.66]No, let's do the jello cup.
[232:15.52]Let's eat it on stream.
[232:24.40]Although, is it really greedy of me to not want to do the training until it's $1,000?
[232:28.23]Um, yeah.
[232:33.21]Screw that.
[232:35.73]Sometimes you get to call it, right?
[232:38.95]Sometimes you just gotta call it.
[232:42.07]Half-off training.
[232:44.57]God damn it.
[232:48.03]Uh, we need to take that opportunity to get some items.
[232:56.41]Let's get a couple of mint leaves.
[232:57.69]Let's get some mangoes.
[233:04.33]Monsters love to snack on this tasty fruit.
[233:06.81]Monsters will gain weight if they eat a lot of sweet foods like this.
[233:10.29]Let's get a couple of mangoes.
[233:16.45]Let's get a couple of mint leaves while they're cheaper.
[233:18.77]Powder.
[233:19.86]He's not fat.
[233:25.91]Spoiling.
[233:26.91]Sour.
[233:28.39]Uh, let's get a nut oil.
[233:32.69]Just in case we need it.
[233:33.51]No, anyway, it's fine.
[233:38.18]It's rumored that a monster would become popular if it eats this.
[233:40.50]Should I just buy this and eat it?
[233:43.02]Is it that easy?
[233:45.64]I guess it is.
[233:46.38]So, if I turn on my stream and do social eating, then I'm gonna be famous.
[233:53.70]We don't have that kind of money.
[234:01.41]Let's see, right where we left off.
[234:02.83]Let's see.
[234:08.41]Um... Let's get skill to, like, 350.
[234:11.51]And then I'll save the game, too.
[234:25.12]Well.
[234:27.84]Uh...
[234:30.24]That was, I guess, easier than throwing rocks.
[234:40.65]It's so funny because he's done that.
[234:44.19]I'm pretty sure he has a 100% chance to do that.
[234:47.95]He's never failed that, I don't think.
[234:49.65]So why would he cheat?
[234:50.73]You're really good at that.
[234:58.97]Popular prunes of popularity.
[235:06.75]Eleven.
[235:08.38]We could learn a move.
[235:09.10]It's possible we could get a new move.
[235:17.97]I'm trying to think of what I'd want to put the most amount of points into.
[235:26.93]Thank you for saving so I can breathe now.
[235:31.33]Sometimes it's just these old games, man.
[235:33.17]I'm telling you.
[235:35.53]We've been so conditioned in the current generation of PC games and even console games, right?
[235:41.34]Just everything.
[235:42.02]Auto-saves, everything.
[235:42.98]There's checkpoints.
[235:45.34]Not back in the day.
[235:47.96]Physically having to save and not doing it and forgetting to do it.
[235:52.73]Holy shit, what a disaster it could be.
[236:02.17]Beanbag Sonic is technically gone, but he lives on in the... heart... of Cura, which that name is... that's like a Final Fantasy... ability item.
[236:16.33]You drink a Cura in Final Fantasy if you have a status effect.
[236:20.11]This is an awful fucking name.
[236:26.07]Stick of the fish.
[236:34.78]350 on the dot.
[236:37.17]Mm-hmm.
[236:37.51]He's stressed out.
[236:42.39]You'll be fine.
[236:45.03]So.
[236:46.75]Hmm.
[236:47.03]350.
[236:47.57]104.
[236:51.13]I think I'm gonna do power here.
[236:54.31]I'm gonna train power.
[236:57.34]I think do Errantry.
[236:59.08]Should I wait for it to be $1,000 or should I just do it now?
[237:02.12]We're in no rush, right?
[237:03.06]How old is he?
[237:06.17]It's just almost about two years.
[237:07.35]Why are we in a rush to do it?
[237:11.40]I would probably just wait.
[237:20.62]Just train it normally and then do a big train, you know?
[237:23.10]Yeah, I never have money to spare.
[237:38.66]I am always broke.
[237:39.58]You're perpetually broke in this game.
[237:43.76]I'm going to let him have a rest here.
[237:52.41]Let's get power to 300 and then I'm dumping almost everything else into life and defense.
[237:59.58]How close are we to 300?
[238:00.20]240, just about.
[238:12.41]I could do another tournament, too.
[238:14.35]Just to get some money.
[238:16.59]But if he's gonna keep cheating, then, you know.
[238:25.16]Scald him.
[238:26.66]Scald him!
[238:27.18]What are my thoughts on Sea of Thieves?
[238:31.62]I have not played it.
[238:36.55]I've played...
[238:38.97]Over zero and under one of Sea of Thieves.
[238:42.84]And that means, if you're curious, I've installed the video game and opened up the menu.
[238:46.78]There you go.
[238:58.44]Level up.
[239:05.94]Why not do pull?
[239:06.84]I would do pull.
[239:07.52]My problem with pull is it's just... You have to have 100 intelligence.
[239:13.40]Some of these monsters with 500 int... That is a one-hit KO if they do an intelligence move to you.
[239:19.82]You will die.
[239:20.70]Because defense doesn't take intelligence moves into account.
[239:26.37]You have to have intelligence to block intelligence moves.
[239:29.43]So... You have to do it.
[239:32.01]Otherwise, you're just gonna get your ass kicked by somebody.
[239:35.98]And good things come to those who wait.
[239:42.88]Bingo.
[239:47.29]Let's... He's well.
[239:49.89]Let's get him... Let's de-stress a little bit here and then send him training.
[239:54.65]What does this thing even do?
[239:59.31]Legend of Zelda item.
[240:01.83]Release some stress.
[240:07.52]And then we'll take him to power training.
[240:15.97]Need to hit harder.
[240:24.59]So this is, uh, power and life, int and life, skill and life, speed and life, power and life.
[240:33.61]It seems that there is a chance to acquire a new technique.
[240:38.48]And I don't care about this.
[240:40.60]Let's make it easy on ourselves.
[240:41.92]We'll just go with the... Let's do the Bug Eye.
[240:49.51]Let's do it!
[240:51.89]Get stronger!
[240:56.27]It was my favorite Smite God.
[240:57.58]I haven't played it in a long time, really, but... It was Kronos.
[241:06.55]Kronos, Anubis, they were a lot of fun to play.
[241:11.27]Make it all the way through this and get me like 50 power.
[241:13.71]And learn a new move, that's devastating.
[241:15.38]Come on.
[241:22.02]Can he cheat here?
[241:22.94]I don't think he can cheat here.
[241:27.62]Ten and four.
[241:28.54]No new technique, unfortunately.
[241:33.84]Here's the thing, we have to wake up the sleeping camel.
[241:39.64]They always do the fake-out failure.
[241:50.28]What defense does the camel have?
[241:51.56]Enter this thing in a tournament.
[241:52.98]Seriously.
[241:57.22]Fail?
[241:58.34]No.
[242:05.26]Get it!
[242:08.00]Did you get it?
[242:10.82]It's weird, because I don't know what a failure is here.
[242:13.32]Not waking him up?
[242:16.70]Apparently.
[242:17.16]Is it the more you have to drain the water?
[242:28.45]And then you fight something at the end.
[242:30.03]Is this the crab, or is this the... Yeah, it's the crab at the end, I think.
[242:39.99]Smash it.
[242:46.07]It'd be easier to walk around it.
[242:49.58]Yeah.
[242:50.48]You could just walk around its legs and not touch it and just get by.
[242:53.58]But that doesn't prove how powerful you are.
[242:58.14]Success.
[242:59.01]Good job.
[243:06.85]Yay!
[243:12.94]New move.
[243:13.60]Ah.
[243:17.04]No new move.
[243:17.70]But we don't really need a new move.
[243:21.26]Oh, no.
[243:21.44]This is the Boba Fett one.
[243:22.24]Okay.
[243:22.34]You know, a new move is great, but... He has a handful of great moves.
[243:41.63]And then you get sucked in, and then... You fight the hornet in the middle.
[243:47.19]And you come out of the sand, asshole, and you win.
[243:50.16]Or you lose.
[243:56.44]He dead.
[244:00.90]No!
[244:01.73]No, no, no, no, no!
[244:02.65]Not Satan!
[244:04.11]Oh, come on!
[244:04.93]No!
[244:05.63]Please!
[244:12.53]Not again.
[244:23.33]That's not Satan, but it's still... Nah, we're leaving.
[244:27.65]I have nothing to prove here.
[244:30.19]It's physically impossible to beat these guys, unless you're a much higher level.
[244:34.09]No, no, no.
[244:34.83]Goodbye.
[244:35.13]What does it select?
[244:58.48]I'm not sure how you beat that.
[244:59.36]You know.
[245:02.78]That guy just did as many colors as there were in a monitor back in fuckin' 1998.
[245:07.65]Good job.
[245:10.85]What are you, running Windows 95?
[245:11.73]Ow.
[245:11.91]That was supposed to be, like, the badum-chee.
[245:19.62]He's fine, he's not, he's alive, he's alive.
[245:27.75]It ran away.
[245:28.51]Are you okay?
[245:30.03]Don't hate me.
[245:30.67]I didn't tell... I tried to get you out of there.
[245:35.62]Too bad I didn't Ctrl-Alt-Delete twice.
[245:37.28]That's right.
[245:37.68]No.
[245:46.11]No.
[245:46.79]This is great.
[245:47.69]Now he's going to be in the hospital for a month.
[245:56.04]How am I... I tried to press select!
[246:00.00]It's a serious injury.
[246:01.70]He's hurt.
[246:02.13]And now he's gonna be even more fucked up.
[246:03.53]His loyalty's gonna be 20.
[246:06.25]How was I supposed to prevent the guy jumping across the map and turning into a drill?
[246:09.19]I just got my head jackhammered.
[246:15.55]How was I supposed to prevent that?
[246:23.92]Come on, you're fine.
[246:26.21]I promise.
[246:26.67]I'll give you meat after this.
[246:27.79]If you live, you get meat.
[246:29.33]That's your... He's still in the hospital.
[246:32.98]I wish it'll come back soon.
[246:36.14]Steak dinner!
[246:39.90]Oh, no.
[246:44.20]He's still in the hospital.
[246:45.42]Is he?
[246:48.43]Yeah, okay.
[246:49.65]Glad you're better.
[246:50.29]16 loyalty.
[246:50.63]Great.
[246:50.75]Like...
[246:59.66]If you don't understand, I didn't do that.
[247:05.42]I didn't want you to fight Satan.
[247:08.05]Satan acted too quick for me.
[247:20.57]It's in his DNA, as it should be.
[247:23.90]That's such bullshit.
[247:28.03]He's fine.
[247:29.84]Look, I'm gonna give him, like, a treat.
[247:31.86]Let's give him some mangoes.
[247:33.72]Eat a couple of these, you know?
[247:35.60]You'll feel a little better.
[247:45.27]Loyalty 18.
[247:46.05]Back where we started.
[247:48.53]I'm gonna feed him meat, too.
[247:49.65]Don't worry.
[247:52.91]In the meantime... Like, go... Look at this.
[248:01.53]No, this is gonna hurt.
[248:05.59]Don't hate me.
[248:06.47]Don't hate me.
[248:07.01]This is to make you stronger.
[248:10.51]This is to make you stronger.
[248:11.69]I have no more training.
[248:16.03]He's gonna actually call it a night.
[248:18.88]Yeah, stream's dying.
[248:19.78]I know.
[248:20.16]It's been doing it all night.
[248:21.12]I'm sorry about that.
[248:23.44]Look, he's gonna get his favorite food.
[248:25.10]Meat.
[248:26.70]Meat.
[248:33.91]He just got out of the hospital and I put him through vigorous don't get hit by the pillars pain training.
[248:43.70]Today is his second birthday.
[248:46.58]Sing the song again.
[248:47.36]Happy birthday, happy birthday.
[248:56.36]Are they spelling out the word?
[248:59.46]Win many matches and raise your rank.
[249:09.25]Sad birthday.
[249:15.17]Just got out of the hospital and I just like beat you up with pillars.
[249:18.64]Happy birthday.
[249:20.16]Hope you win more matches, honey.
[249:25.62]It's your favorite cake.
[249:29.14]There's probably some crunchies in there.
[249:36.05]Now you're happy.
[249:37.17]What a monster.
[249:39.01]Keep up the good work.
[249:50.08]22 loyalty.
[249:51.08]Saved the game.
[249:52.54]Dude, what's with the... Why are Twitch's servers getting sneezed on right now?
[250:05.11]What do we got for tournaments?
[250:06.33]Here, we got this one.
[250:07.01]This is... Not... No, I'm not putting him in anything yet.
[250:11.96]We could do another training here.
[250:14.62]But... I don't think I want to do that.
[250:17.62]Let's do another skill, because he's good at this, and he likes to do this one.
[250:28.69]Plus, it can't hurt to get this to 400.
[250:36.56]Or at least close to it.
[250:41.75]Seems well.
[250:42.25]Let's do it again.
[250:52.42]Let's get Skilled to 400 and I'm gonna leave it alone for a while.
[250:55.52]We'll go back to Defense and Power.
[250:56.76]Well, Life and Power.
[251:12.09]Jerm is the only streamer who can ignore an entire paragraph in the slower chat no let me go and read it hold on yeah I know to unlock new monsters you got to go on expeditions and find special items yeah
[251:42.54]I knew it.
[251:42.98]I knew that already.
[251:44.52]I'm not a slow reader.
[251:45.56]I mean, no.
[251:50.42]This defense reduces all types of damage.
[251:52.88]To unlock new monsters, you gotta go on an expedition.
[251:58.17]I... Hey, come on!
[252:04.03]Let's do another sea tournament here.
[252:05.51]Let's get some more money.
[252:07.85]No, that one's too many people.
[252:10.05]This one, the crab claw.
[252:12.63]Crab claw is the one we're going for next.
[252:15.09]Gonna lose fans, but we probably won't.
[252:18.81]We won't.
[252:32.46]Make your dog fatter.
[252:36.56]Good.
[252:45.54]O-W-O, okay, one last time.
[252:47.54]Pee-pee, poo-poo, okay, fuck.
[252:49.22]Now you guys... See, good things come to those who sit on their thumbs.
[252:54.99]Another free training.
[252:55.97]I mean...
[253:11.89]Hey, just passing through before emote only mode kicks in.
[253:20.53]Turn it on!
[253:40.63]He needs to be fattened up.
[253:41.87]He's eating fresh fish!
[253:50.61]Here we go.
[253:52.81]We got sails everywhere.
[253:56.49]Sails, on top of sails, on top of sails.
[254:01.11]He's well, he's okay.
[254:04.43]Let's do it.
[254:05.07]He's fine.
[254:07.47]We're gonna do power again.
[254:11.96]power again or power or speed probably no let's do power uh there is no defense so I would do it but it's not here I can't do it power or speed if he meets Satan again he might actually die
[254:43.00]Should we do speed?
[254:46.72]Power?
[254:47.90]I'm gonna do power.
[254:53.31]And let's just go against the dinner plate.
[254:54.89]Make it easy.
[254:55.39]I don't care.
[255:05.48]I want to... I need to be a heavy hitter.
[255:13.02]I have a really, really high chance to hit.
[255:16.37]Might as well have those moves that actually land do more damage.
[255:23.93]You have a higher chance of facing Satan if you go to a low difficulty.
[255:26.91]Well, let's hope I can press the button fast enough this time.
[255:30.38]No, he didn't read that paragraph.
[255:40.05]Just skip it?
[255:40.65]Alright.
[255:41.11]We can't skip this one.
[255:42.05]This is the funny one, though.
[255:42.99]This is the one where it's all kinds of weird... Look it!
[255:46.37]See?
[255:49.68]No technique.
[255:53.06]Remember this one where he drains the, uh... ocean?
[255:59.48]Success!
[256:02.27]Alright, life leveled up.
[256:05.21]Antlion.
[256:06.73]I have to watch this one because I want to see what I'm going against.
[256:23.40]He's like a chicken.
[256:29.79]Alright, come on.
[256:32.31]Get out of there and just run into the stupid plate.
[256:37.20]And learn a new technique right now.
[256:42.30]No!
[256:56.37]What?!
[256:56.63]This dog just keeps getting hurt.
[257:13.49]See, he was only in the hospital for a week.
[257:16.28]He's fine.
[257:19.54]His floor is even lower.
[257:27.57]Likes meat, dislikes Jeremy.
[257:29.43]Therefore, Jeremy is now meat.
[257:32.50]I'm on the menu.
[257:35.60]Fuck.
[257:47.07]Don't you want to play or something, man?
[257:48.31]Can't we go out backyard and throw the rocks?
[257:52.59]Is it still, everything's still on sale?
[257:59.82]What do you think?
[258:00.91]If you like it, get some.
[258:08.29]Is it bananas?
[258:10.98]Magic bananas.
[258:16.84]Give him another injury. 150.
[258:25.55]I don't want that shit.
[258:26.73]No.
[258:28.07]I'm not buying it anymore.
[258:34.73]Take a rest.
[258:35.25]Give him a ton of drugs.
[258:45.56]He's great.
[258:46.24]His stats are awesome at this point.
[258:47.97]200, 300, 384.
[258:54.93]See, now that I'm at 300 power and 384 skill, like, I think I'm about right.
[258:58.17]Now we can start to focus on... We can just go halfsies, you know what I'm saying?
[259:08.20]Let's see.
[259:09.66]Power and life.
[259:11.18]Int and skill.
[259:12.30]Defense and life.
[259:14.25]Speed and intelligence.
[259:15.27]Defense and life if you lose int.
[259:17.53]What do you guys think?
[259:20.01]Should we focus on defense?
[259:22.15]I'm gonna focus on defense from here on out.
[259:31.16]He's cheating again.
[259:33.68]I mean, is this cheating or is that just smart?
[259:36.93]Shouldn't that increase my intelligence?
[259:53.46]Same thing, do it again.
[259:56.66]Yeah, train smarter, not harder.
[260:04.84]He's good.
[260:05.12]What did you say, probably defense 200?
[260:11.66]Uh, I don't want to be... I don't want to give him meat, because... Should I?
[260:24.29]No.
[260:24.71]Because he's soft already.
[260:27.49]We need to keep him as close to even as we can.
[260:34.60]Uncombine him and get BBs back.
[260:39.06]Take a rest.
[260:47.89]You can't unfuse.
[260:48.89]Again.
[260:56.05]Ah, fuck it, man.
[260:57.51]We'll just be a moron.
[261:00.19]We can get intelligence back up anyways.
[261:01.87]It's just tough to do that.
[261:02.53]I'm going to do this two or three times, and then I'm going to do intelligence back to 100.
[261:04.93]This is just so much faster to get more defense.
[261:09.49]You get like 10 to 12 every time.
[261:10.87]Or 9, but, you know.
[261:16.92]We'll do this to 200 defense, and then I'm going to get back to 100 intelligence.
[261:29.67]I want meat.
[261:31.95]Do you want us to... No.
[261:35.17]Too soft.
[261:35.61]See?
[261:37.45]He's got it.
[261:38.21]190.
[261:38.33]It's alright.
[261:38.85]He leveled down in intelligence.
[261:40.68]It's okay.
[262:01.50]Go to sleep.
[262:04.00]Get you up and do the same thing again.
[262:08.96]The bird and all the training exercises is the trainer.
[262:13.55]It's like the drill sergeant, apparently.
[262:20.95]Cup of jelly.
[262:21.77]Thought it didn't like meat.
[262:26.45]Oh man, this is a carnivore.
[262:27.49]This is a triceratops dog thing.
[262:34.00]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[262:38.51]Why train defense when you can train speed and dodge everything?
[262:40.63]Well, our last character was that.
[262:45.11]Fairly low defense, but a ton of speed.
[262:47.96]And when you got hit by something...
[262:52.29]I just, I seem to get screwed so often in RNG in this game that even with like a 20 to 30 percent chance to hit somebody, the other person, the other monster, would hit me for like 75 damage with like a 20 percent chance to hit.
[263:05.26]So I will, I want to beef myself up a little bit here.
[263:09.62]I'm gonna go the opposite way.
[263:21.06]I want me... You do a lot of talking.
[263:26.18]Fine.
[263:29.61]Fine.
[263:33.25]Beanbag Sonic did not talk this much.
[263:38.53]Better... You better do it then.
[263:43.86]No.
[263:44.24]Unbelievable.
[263:46.88]Unbelievable.
[263:48.68]Yes.
[263:49.28]You're in deep shit.
[263:57.76]You go to bed.
[263:59.23]You get your ass up and you get back in that pool and you make it right.
[264:02.79]That's $300.
[264:07.18]And I love you.
[264:09.04]You're my special boy.
[264:11.16]But... Get your ass in that pool.
[264:23.53]And that's when I would go, oh, I love you so much, and I would nuzzle my face.
[264:28.13]What?
[264:29.69]Did he just do it twice?
[264:30.69]Is he cheating?
[264:31.25]Oh, no, he didn't.
[264:37.87]See?
[264:40.31]Look at that.
[264:45.14]Did its best.
[264:46.80]That's when we say, it's what you should have done last time.
[265:01.59]Back to even.
[265:08.19]Rest up.
[265:08.69]We're even.
[265:11.93]That's exactly where you want to be.
[265:16.87]What?
[265:19.05]What?
[265:21.27]I... We need to keep him on even.
[265:23.09]I would love to just... I would love to grab his face and like kiss him a million times and hug him and be like, you're so wonderful.
[265:30.52]I do that already.
[265:31.90]But in this game, if you're too soft, then you lose later tournaments.
[265:38.63]And now he's stressed.
[265:39.47]Watch, I'll make him an iced tea.
[265:41.97]Check this out.
[265:47.53]See, here comes Dad with an iced tea.
[265:50.66]His favorite.
[265:57.67]And now... Just relax again.
[266:01.35]Don't push him too hard.
[266:02.35]He's giving his best.
[266:09.58]He's very well... Fuck!
[266:16.64]Alright.
[266:21.72]200 health.
[266:22.64]200 defense.
[266:24.49]Speed and intelligence.
[266:25.81]I think I can do that, right?
[266:31.63]Skill and intelligence.
[266:32.98]Speed and intelligence.
[266:33.76]We lose a little bit of power.
[266:36.02]Let's just do it once.
[266:37.68]We've never even seen it before.
[266:47.06]I think he's cheating.
[266:55.17]Please stop it.
[266:57.33]Please.
[267:00.89]Doesn't that seem dangerous?
[267:01.99]How is that cheating?
[267:02.83]That's just putting yourself in danger.
[267:08.21]Please do it correctly this time.
[267:09.50]Good.
[267:13.98]Good.
[267:15.50]You've played enough Mario Kart to know how to do this.
[267:17.26]There you go.
[267:24.45]Okay, now we didn't even lose and we're good with power still.
[267:27.51]We level back up with intelligence.
[267:29.27]Speed's back up a little bit.
[267:31.45]Let's see where that actually puts us.
[267:33.63]I think we're ready for a tournament.
[267:36.71]300, 200.
[267:37.11]We've got a good amount of power, good amount of skill.
[267:40.35]Defense is okay.
[267:42.77]Speed is okay.
[267:44.59]Life is decent.
[267:45.55]I think it's time.
[267:48.23]How do we make some money here?
[267:50.51]Hero badge.
[267:54.14]Should we go for the... No, but... A hero badge is a special item, right?
[268:02.47]I wonder if we should just try to get it.
[268:10.38]Anybody with any knowledge know if this is actually worth getting to combine with a monster or something?
[268:21.77]Yeah?
[268:25.76]Not a lot of money, but if I win the badge, then... Let me just save it first.
[268:38.49]How many participants are there?
[268:47.25]Six.
[268:52.14]Don't do it, I'm too low level.
[268:54.54]You're gonna lose in too low level?
[268:55.66]Okay.
[268:55.90]That's all I needed to hear.
[268:58.54]We're gonna go for this one.
[268:59.58]Get some more disk chips.
[269:01.72]$3,000.
[269:01.78]We could do... No.
[269:04.44]That's... I mean, this is risky.
[269:08.00]I could try it, but this is risky.
[269:09.52]I'm gonna try this one.
[269:10.98]I'm gonna go for the 5,000 gold.
[269:12.00]On, uh... How long?
[269:14.44]When's that?
[269:16.66]That is... One... Two... So we've got two weeks.
[269:20.10]We can do one more thing of training.
[269:22.65]Let's do...
[269:25.13]Let's just do skill again, just make that the best that I can possibly make it.
[269:30.89]Let him rest, and then try to win five grand.
[269:45.17]Ah, that's right, he's got 24 loyalty, you're right.
[269:55.37]I might have to skip that one.
[270:04.24]Oh, it's gonna be another half-off, isn't it?
[270:06.20]Yeah, it is.
[270:09.12]Shit.
[270:12.08]Uh... Let's see here.
[270:14.26]How much money do I have?
[270:18.99]490.
[270:20.47]So it's all this month.
[270:24.51]Uh, let's see.
[270:25.05]So I could do... If I win this tournament, then I can send him to training and potentially learn some more moves.
[270:37.64]I'm gonna lose way too many fans if I do this one.
[270:39.68]We're gonna go for C. Let's let him rest.
[270:44.90]Rest for like a week or two.
[270:52.27]That sea tournament should be alright.
[270:54.05]Even if we don't win it.
[270:55.05]We should make a... Let's rest again.
[271:04.72]I want him to be very well.
[271:06.82]It's a male.
[271:11.46]Yeah, the store is half off or 20% off or whatever.
[271:13.84]I'm losing fans.
[271:19.02]He's very well.
[271:19.64]27 loyalty.
[271:19.82]Um...
[271:23.86]I think that's alright.
[271:25.12]It's terrible, but we need some money.
[271:28.50]And if I win this, then we can send him to training.
[271:37.68]Save it.
[271:40.04]I can't.
[271:43.28]It was saved.
[271:44.24]Like, not even five, ten minutes ago.
[271:45.72]We're fine.
[271:52.09]Resting twice in a row.
[271:53.07]I was trying to get as much loyalty as I could.
[271:54.83]A lot of money on the line.
[272:06.58]There's tons of monsters you can only get once you get to 50 fame.
[272:11.46]Yeah.
[272:11.90]Yeah.
[272:16.08]This game's a crazy balance between needing to not be broke, have the monster not hate you, and to have fans.
[272:23.04]Alright, his defense is pretty terrible.
[272:28.79]We both have equal amount of skill.
[272:30.15]Equal amount of power.
[272:32.45]See if I can zone him.
[272:33.29]Yeah, I can zone him.
[272:42.03]He can be zoned.
[272:47.83]Go for a one-two punch.
[272:49.29]That was gutsy.
[272:53.46]Eek.
[272:54.64]Eek.
[272:57.24]Let's hold back.
[273:05.82]Goddamn.
[273:07.14]Goddamn, man.
[273:08.22]Really?
[273:11.27]Can I please do a move?
[273:12.61]Oh, this is a fucking disaster at this point.
[273:14.75]I gotta get a crit here.
[273:17.35]Come on, two-punch him.
[273:18.05]Come on.
[273:18.81]Give it to me.
[273:20.95]Big hit.
[273:22.47]Again.
[273:23.37]Again.
[273:23.63]Hit it again.
[273:23.99]Oh, dumbass.
[273:26.13]Come on.
[273:31.91]I gotta hit him with a big hit right now.
[273:33.29]No, I'm dead.
[273:35.28]What the fuck?
[273:44.86]When you have equal stats with somebody, it really just becomes who rolled a six.
[273:55.39]Back to the fucking hospital.
[274:00.49]Sorry, we can still make some money here.
[274:02.27]Except to win one or two games.
[274:13.79]Long range?
[274:14.33]Well, I tried, but they can bridge the gap, and eventually when they do, if you get hit... He wasn't listening to my commands at that point, so... Alright, just don't be... I have to stay... Not in... We gotta go close.
[274:31.98]Goddammit, dude, really?
[274:36.36]I'm getting so fucked here.
[274:39.13]Big time.
[274:40.99]Oh my god.
[274:41.87]Okay.
[274:43.79]Finally Jesus Christ Get in there get in there.
[274:54.96]Oh my god.
[274:55.74]That's three out of four moves.
[274:57.04]We're fucking confused Give me a break man Do it again do it no that's five out of fucking six.
[275:08.67]Oh, oh
[275:16.42]was... got vaped on.
[275:22.87]This really is all Satan's fault, it is.
[275:26.53]Jeremy with a loyalty.
[275:27.59]I know, I know, I messed up.
[275:30.39]But we needed the money.
[275:32.58]Because he's immediately going to training.
[275:36.28]For a thousand dollars cheaper.
[275:47.66]Blame Satan?
[275:48.30]Well, that's what put him in the hospital for like three months.
[275:52.26]You can't say that was part of the reason why that did, you know, that was why it happened.
[275:55.54]Alright, we know how to fight this guy.
[275:58.94]Make him eat bananas and that's it.
[276:01.07]Nothing else matters.
[276:05.87]He has a sneeze move.
[276:13.95]This monster is stupid.
[276:15.15]I wish we leveled up this guy.
[276:20.73]Guy has a sneeze.
[276:22.49]Alright, pull it back.
[276:32.43]Let him do his thing.
[276:33.13]Let him eat.
[276:33.67]Let him waste.
[276:34.23]Let him waste God's own eating.
[276:37.29]That has to do something crazy.
[276:38.35]You know what that has to do is probably like your next attack is... Your follow-up attack is probably like 50% more damage.
[276:44.41]Something crazy.
[276:45.55]It has to be.
[276:51.12]Back it up.
[276:57.80]There's the victory right there.
[276:58.80]Just stay back.
[277:00.40]There's the win.
[277:00.80]Alright, we'll make money from that.
[277:08.27]It heals for a hundred if it hits.
[277:11.33]I haven't seen it happen one time then.
[277:15.25]Out of like ten bananas eaten, that's zero.
[277:17.31]Still, we still have a chance.
[277:22.66]Yeah, that's a chance here still.
[277:24.88]Alright, come on, beat him.
[277:28.54]Well, here's the rematch.
[277:29.62]Let's see if we can win the tournament.
[277:35.19]Alright, it's time to play Yahtzee against a similar stat-based creature.
[277:45.87]This time, I'm going to play by just doing the camp strategy.
[277:50.19]Just staying back as far as I can.
[277:54.34]I had to do that.
[277:56.64]I had to do that too, and how are you... How are you gonna do that?
[277:59.54]How are you gonna do me like that, huh?
[278:00.68]How are you gonna do me like that?
[278:03.14]You don't understand what I'm saying?
[278:10.24]How are you gonna do me like that?
[278:16.54]How are you doing me like this?
[278:34.11]That's just absolutely fucking bogus.
[278:39.17]Whatever.
[278:39.55]That's XCOM.
[278:56.56]Should've leveled speed.
[278:57.68]I mean, 80% is 80%, regardless of speed.
[278:59.22]That is...
[279:05.85]I would take those odds.
[279:08.62]If you gave me four chances at 80% and you said, I don't know, man, hey, you know, if the 20% happens, you die.
[279:15.58]But you get four chances at 80%, I'd be like, do it.
[279:22.78]Like, I would be completely confident that I'd be fine.
[279:25.70]Sorry, we still made money.
[279:30.70]I'm gonna lose fans, though.
[279:32.08]No, that's good.
[279:32.68]That's okay.
[279:41.01]You'd be dead?
[279:41.49]No, you wouldn't.
[279:44.03]That's just Russian roulette.
[279:49.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[279:50.21]But four, four times 80%.
[279:53.66]It's different.
[280:01.26]No, it's not.
[280:04.45]If I told you to play Russian roulette right now, would you?
[280:07.13]Oh, yeah.
[280:07.65]Like, no, I wouldn't.
[280:08.39]Get the fuck out of here.
[280:14.68]It's actually worse odds.
[280:18.72]Yeah, Russian Roulette is what, 1 out of 6?
[280:20.06]So you're telling me from 1 out of 4?
[280:28.23]Oh, yayay.
[280:32.31]I'm not done streaming.
[280:34.63]But I do have to pee again.
[280:36.03]Because I just keep getting another drink and drinking the whole thing.
[280:39.55]I'm on a reserve of pee right now.
[280:41.04]So I'm going to pee again.
[280:42.04]I'm not done.
[280:42.46]I'm still going.
[280:43.84]I'm still having a good time.
[280:45.28]No reason to stop now.
[280:47.20]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[281:02.88]yes because okay so I had to pee really badly before the stream started I drank a coffee before the stream started right so down to fucking large coffee that's going down and it's going into my system coffee is also a diuretic so then I get a water and then I get a juice and every time I go upstairs and I come back downstairs I have another highly hydrating liquid
[281:26.72]You know I'm talking a lot and need to make sure my throat's not coated.
[281:31.39]So I'm just constantly refilling my pee reserves.
[281:34.28]I'll be right back.
[283:37.36]Mature stream for mature gamers, huh?
[283:45.79]We're all drunk tonight.
[283:46.91]I'm sober as a... I was going to say fox.
[283:52.05]Then I was going to say stone.
[283:54.60]I'm as sober as a stone.
[283:55.84]No, it's stone cold sober.
[283:59.40]I don't know.
[284:01.16]Back to the game.
[284:10.17]So... We have some money.
[284:15.87]Hmm.
[284:18.73]I wonder if we should do... We'll just do skill to level up to level 9.
[284:22.39]Just because it's right in arm's reach.
[284:26.05]Might as well take it, right?
[284:30.86]If it's close and within arm's reach, just grab it.
[284:36.38]Jeremy, do something funny for a change.
[284:40.70]Alright, I'm gonna put on the webcam and, like, just start screaming and, like, taking my finger and going up and down on my lips and stuff.
[284:48.85]Naked.
[284:53.27]That's not funny, that's just deranged.
[284:55.33]I'm not gonna do that, never mind.
[284:59.28]We have enough to send him to dog college.
[285:10.80]Now I'm on board.
[285:20.89]Yes, we got it!
[285:22.59]Now I can get a fun can.
[285:24.55]I'll send these five marks.
[285:28.76]How many of those did I have to eat before I finally got enough Pepsi points to get a shitty handbag?
[285:38.97]I had to drink, like, 150 cans of soda.
[285:44.79]To get a couple of stickers.
[285:49.13]Uh, good bet.
[286:00.43]He's well.
[286:03.97]Four hundred eight.
[286:08.40]Okay, speed or life.
[286:16.19]I'm gonna say let's go with life for a little bit.
[286:24.95]It's cheating.
[286:25.35]It was barely cheating.
[286:32.79]You could have called that an accident and it wasn't cheating.
[286:38.87]I need to stop scolding him because he's going to lose loyalty.
[286:41.63]I'm going to let him just... Honestly, guys, okay.
[286:44.17]I'm going to let him just run amok and get us back to like 50 or 60 loyalty.
[286:49.13]If he wasn't a cheater, I wouldn't have to say stop cheating.
[286:52.55]And if I don't say stop cheating, then I'm a softie.
[286:55.19]Can't win.
[286:55.53]Do it again.
[287:08.71]There he goes.
[287:18.97]You need to get another five of those after you get the doll to get a second doll and go on an expedition for glue to unlock a monster.
[287:27.60]That seems really complicated.
[287:33.34]That seems pretty complicated.
[287:37.06]What's the battle?
[287:38.96]C battle, eight entrance.
[287:40.20]That's too many.
[287:41.29]That's too long for 2000.
[287:42.05]I mean, unless it was an official, but this one's eight.
[287:47.75]No, we're going to skip it.
[287:50.83]We'll do this one.
[287:56.72]Get ready for that one.
[287:57.88]So that means we got... Let's do one more of life training.
[288:12.97]There are multiple monsters you can only unlock after having your monster die.
[288:16.00]That's sad.
[288:24.97]Ah, shit.
[288:31.51]Dammit.
[288:33.53]Well, we need to, yeah, we need to go in another tournament.
[288:43.64]Do the drills at lower intelligence so you can start being such a smartass.
[288:46.38]Come on, saving grace here.
[288:52.49]Oh, it's a fun can.
[288:53.69]I'm so glad I sent for this.
[288:56.87]What is that character on there?
[289:01.03]That's a child's rendition of Huey, Dewey, or Louie from DuckTales.
[289:07.97]Showing how much of it's his favorite show.
[289:11.20]I wonder what's inside.
[289:12.78]This is my first fun can.
[289:16.43]Ah, somebody sent me shit!
[289:18.87]Those rascals!
[289:25.90]Oh, it's a... you combined it.
[289:27.50]It's a... it's still... it's still poo.
[289:30.90]Pretty cute doll, huh?
[289:33.36]What's wrong, Hiro?
[289:35.08]You want this doll, don't you?
[289:37.16]What do you think?
[289:37.87]Shall we give it to him?
[289:42.23]He wants the doll.
[289:43.21]Should I give it to him?
[289:45.73]Don't give it to him?
[289:55.36]I thought somebody said we need to hold on to this.
[289:57.10]Give... Give him... No.
[290:10.97]No, I thought... I thought...
[290:22.85]He's going to take off.
[290:24.05]We're revving up the lawnmower.
[290:28.79]Pretty sure it's a monster item.
[290:33.76]Yes, I understand you want to speed off at the red light, but you're not cool.
[290:39.62]I'm not going to do it.
[290:40.92]I'm not going to do it.
[290:43.32]We need it, alright?
[290:44.46]I was told that we need this item.
[290:45.54]Give it, you don't need it.
[290:51.61]Ah, but it's an
[290:55.95]I'm gonna give it to him.
[291:02.00]I'm so... I feel like this is a very, very important part of this game.
[291:14.59]Alright.
[291:15.43]I'm gonna... Give it!
[291:18.23]Give it!
[291:18.83]Give it to him!
[291:19.43]Give it!
[291:20.57]I'm giving it to him!
[291:49.43]Everyone was telling me to do it.
[291:52.85]Everybody told me to do it.
[291:54.31]I didn't see any fucking people.
[291:56.08]I saw like... It was chocolate and you gave it to a dog.
[292:09.93]Why?
[292:10.25]Well, why did he want it?
[292:13.91]Why did he want that?
[292:19.99]So it's fucking meaningless.
[292:20.69]So none of this matters anyway.
[292:25.78]So this entire stream chat argument is fucking meaningless.
[292:54.51]Alright, when's the next battle?
[292:55.87]Right here.
[293:01.85]How's he doing?
[293:03.03]Let's let him rest.
[293:05.35]And take him into the B cup.
[293:13.31]He's well.
[293:15.45]He only has 26 loyalty.
[293:17.25]God damn it.
[293:18.51]Let's do the C cup again.
[293:19.69]Ugh.
[293:26.45]No, we're doing B. It's only four entrants.
[293:38.06]We'll lose fans if we do anything else.
[293:53.15]Jeremy, let's win.
[293:57.48]To the hospital.
[293:59.36]No, you remember these dickheads.
[294:00.54]That's a hermit crab.
[294:03.43]That thing doesn't do anything.
[294:07.17]Let's go.
[294:07.51]If I get to win once or twice, then I'll get a thousand dollars.
[294:17.65]Christ.
[294:22.78]He's got mostly... He's stacked across the board.
[294:26.45]There ain't nothing I can do besides pray.
[294:37.35]No.
[294:39.86]Let's just move on.
[294:40.74]I have to win one time?
[294:41.78]Just beat one of these guys.
[294:49.96]We can beat the stupid hermit crab.
[294:55.30]Duelists.
[294:57.00]That's a wall.
[295:00.20]See?
[295:00.46]We can beat the Hermit Crab.
[295:06.20]And we might actually get lucky here.
[295:12.99]It's possible.
[295:19.42]Look, speed is terrible.
[295:21.32]He has a lot of defense, but I mean, he might not even hit me once because he's so bad at swinging.
[295:26.92]We just have to... try to survive.
[295:29.66]Keep it up.
[295:38.50]Might want to get in close here.
[295:39.48]Look at that.
[295:41.66]Perfect.
[295:42.04]He missed completely.
[295:49.46]So far, so good.
[295:50.86]Keep up that guts.
[295:51.54]Nice, nice, nice, nice.
[295:55.08]Keep it up.
[295:56.52]Damn it.
[296:01.78]It's alright.
[296:07.15]Staying close.
[296:12.27]Damn it.
[296:12.89]I needed to hit that.
[296:18.58]It's alright.
[296:19.32]It's alright.
[296:19.84]We're winning by percentage still.
[296:23.32]That's not good.
[296:25.38]I have to hit this.
[296:27.10]You stupid mother... That's the victory right there.
[296:31.39]That's what we needed.
[296:32.31]Perfect.
[296:32.69]Good.
[296:33.49]We win.
[296:34.37]I just made $1,000.
[296:34.67]At least.
[296:47.52]Save.
[296:48.76]You can't save mid-tournament.
[296:50.50]That's not how it works.
[296:56.71]No, no one's going to beat the oil seal.
[297:04.47]But we teased 0-2.
[297:06.35]I told you this guy sucks, but we're going to lose to the guy that sucks the most.
[297:17.37]I don't know why that's in my chat box.
[297:19.79]See, it's just a question of... He's not that great.
[297:26.99]But he has high defense.
[297:28.17]You have to outlast him.
[297:30.07]Try to stay the fuck away.
[297:37.13]Foolery, of course.
[297:38.65]Fucking tomfoolery, right?
[297:47.34]Had to hit it.
[297:47.78]I'm gonna try it again.
[297:52.78]It's not doing that much damage.
[297:53.85]It's still possible.
[297:54.81]Will you please do a move?
[297:55.87]Are you letting him just do this over and over again?
[298:00.41]Get in there.
[298:01.33]And do the one-two punch.
[298:09.51]Nice.
[298:09.87]Good miss.
[298:11.85]Again, one-two.
[298:14.56]Miss.
[298:15.74]Nice.
[298:16.32]One-two punch.
[298:19.34]It's not what I wanted to do, but that's okay.
[298:24.26]Don't hit me with any huge moves.
[298:25.59]That was clutch.
[298:31.77]Do it again.
[298:39.25]It's still possible to win with just sheer luck at this point.
[298:48.45]Wait, Jeremy, hear me out.
[298:49.35]Jump out of this by pressing select.
[298:50.93]What are you saying?
[298:53.17]Jump out of this by pressing select.
[298:54.85]Oh, you're going to love this.
[298:56.15]Give up and then go to save and come back and turn again.
[298:58.93]Isn't that a good one?
[299:05.50]Alright, now lose to Doulas.
[299:10.30]How?
[299:14.94]Okay, we have a three-way tie here.
[299:19.21]duelists beat him again.
[299:23.67]Okay, here we go.
[299:26.37]We're gonna win.
[299:26.99]I'm gonna win the tournament.
[299:27.73]I just beat him.
[299:34.43]I'm ready to win right now.
[299:39.74]Just gotta do the right dodges.
[299:43.28]Gotta get good hits.
[299:46.60]Dodge it.
[299:48.68]We tried.
[299:53.27]Do it again.
[299:57.57]Do it again.
[299:58.51]Three times the time.
[300:00.71]Bingo.
[300:02.77]Now be careful.
[300:03.41]Hold off.
[300:05.23]Do it again.
[300:07.18]Fool.
[300:12.76]Stay out of the intel.
[300:13.50]I can take a scratch.
[300:18.20]No!
[300:31.04]Dammit.
[300:49.44]Still made a lot of money.
[300:50.52]It's okay.
[300:52.68]Please don't go to the hospital.
[300:54.12]Why did I lose fans?! !
[300:56.74]I came in second place in my current bracket.
[301:00.36]Why did people leave?
[301:11.13]It's just, it's the Hail Mary characters.
[301:13.21]We should just make one, honestly.
[301:16.59]You have a terrible amount of speed, but if you hit somebody one time, you do their entire health pool.
[301:24.72]It's just throwing a bomb past to the end zone every single play.
[301:28.75]It's gonna work a couple times.
[301:38.02]You did good.
[301:39.96]You made money.
[301:46.96]Alright.
[301:51.11]Take a rest.
[301:59.77]You gotta stop advancing your monster's rank before he's ready.
[302:02.00]Farm some cash from non-rank matches so you can afford to raise a monster that isn't trash.
[302:07.30]This guy's not trash!
[302:12.69]It's just, we keep going up and then going back down.
[302:17.11]We keep doing the tournament and then I keep losing fame because I'm not doing the current bracket.
[302:32.11]Trash purple wolf.
[302:33.27]He's fine.
[302:36.11]Sonic got to A. And he was our first monster.
[302:41.32]He was at A rank.
[302:43.36]He was just about to enter.
[302:44.92]And he died.
[302:45.38]I like that idea.
[302:53.79]Somebody said just go balls deep in power and skill.
[302:59.24]He just walked himself behind the shed.
[303:01.94]Training.
[303:05.52]He's in power.
[303:07.98]Okay, I got two stars in power now.
[303:24.41]He didn't even win B?
[303:25.23]Yeah, he did, didn't he?
[303:35.19]He's getting old?
[303:42.29]Sonic passed.
[303:45.89]No, he turned into this.
[303:53.20]Alright, let's train.
[303:54.46]Let's get out there.
[303:57.32]How's he doing?
[303:58.50]What do we got?
[304:03.08]Round robin.
[304:07.29]Ron Robin.
[304:07.83]No, when's another one?
[304:10.75]This is official.
[304:11.77]I don't want to do that one.
[304:14.19]Spring Carnival.
[304:15.67]I'll try to do this one.
[304:16.55]How old is he?
[304:21.45]2'9".
[304:21.53]He's huge now, though.
[304:38.56]I love how I still have those two save files back there.
[304:41.91]Like, as if I'm gonna go back, like, four hours in game time.
[304:49.05]Stop doing B, he's still a C rank.
[304:50.87]But I need to prove to the world that I can do it!
[304:53.27]Let's go.
[305:01.51]Errantry.
[305:03.23]Power.
[305:11.42]Power... power.
[305:17.04]Get out there.
[305:27.87]Success!
[305:31.39]This isn't a cartoon, Jerma.
[305:32.49]This is real life.
[305:33.11]You can't just will yourself to victory.
[305:34.97]You say that.
[305:37.97]Funny, he got it.
[305:38.53]If he runs into Satan, don't worry.
[305:43.99]I'm going to spam.
[305:46.03]Select.
[305:49.60]Success.
[305:51.22]No techniques.
[305:56.14]Huge ant line.
[306:01.70]Success.
[306:03.45]No new techniques.
[306:10.19]I can't beat Satan, no.
[306:18.39]I thought that said huge ass lion.
[306:20.21]Alright, this guy's a fucking chump.
[306:27.66]We can beat this guy.
[306:29.50]And then we'll take his DNA, right?
[306:32.92]Oh my god, please.
[306:34.88]Please take the buttered popcorn piece.
[306:37.40]Take him on so we can take him.
[306:38.48]Can we steal him?
[306:44.86]You can do this.
[306:48.37]Nice.
[306:54.35]Oh, don't let him do that to you.
[306:56.17]I don't want to be in the hospital.
[306:57.83]Kill him!
[307:00.02]I'm about to hit select.
[307:01.62]I'm going to hit select in five seconds.
[307:04.52]If you don't show me that you're going to win, if you don't, do it.
[307:10.68]Okay, okay, do it again.
[307:13.01]You're not going to get hit more than one more time.
[307:30.24]Damn it.
[307:35.92]I want the buttered popcorn.
[307:37.07]Oh well.
[307:46.90]Hospital frames.
[307:50.68]Fuck.
[307:57.80]I love this game.
[307:58.62]This game's a lot of fun.
[308:06.23]Need to save up money.
[308:07.13]Alright, I'm just gonna do a bunch of shitty tournaments.
[308:10.09]I don't care if he dies.
[308:10.87]You know what I'm saying?
[308:21.14]That sounds really bad, but let me just explain myself.
[308:25.24]We're gonna save it.
[308:31.92]Yeah, you're fine.
[308:32.79]Praise him.
[308:33.59]Doesn't matter.
[308:42.27]He's gonna live a very long, loving life.
[308:45.11]I'm gonna just have him go and make a bunch of money.
[308:49.41]He's got good power now.
[308:50.31]I can just farm C. No official tournament.
[309:04.76]Go to bed.
[309:06.79]Now he's spoiled.
[309:07.63]Oh.
[309:08.29]Cora seems very tired.
[309:12.79]Take the week off.
[309:15.07]Frames are dying.
[309:15.73]I wish there was something I could do about it.
[309:17.25]I really do.
[309:19.67]This is the second server I've tried to connect to.
[309:29.22]I don't think it's my internet right now.
[309:31.10]I think it's my connection to Twitch's East Coast servers.
[309:33.56]For some reason, it's all screwed up.
[309:34.90]Nah, he's better now.
[309:40.05]So what have we got?
[309:40.93]What can we do here?
[309:42.05]This is C, the 8 entrance, round robin.
[309:45.70]That's the official tournament.
[309:47.60]Don't want to do that.
[309:48.92]This one right here.
[309:49.48]Disk chip.
[309:51.98]2000.
[309:52.78]We'll plan on that one.
[309:56.38]So let's do a little bit more defense, I would say.
[309:58.71]At this point, we're not really giving a shit about intelligence.
[310:04.95]I want to play with you next week.
[310:06.99]Yeah, that's fine.
[310:08.49]Am I going to play Monster Hunter 3?
[310:13.76]Absolutely.
[310:17.38]And now it's dying again.
[310:29.20]Do you see official?
[310:30.44]I mean, I already did see official.
[310:32.96]And if it's just about money... If it's a money thing, there's eight participants.
[310:40.46]It's a longer tournament for the same amount of money.
[310:43.21]And I've already done see official.
[310:49.02]Let's go play.
[310:54.82]Why are you doing this?
[310:55.80]Let me check my internet again.
[310:56.78]I mean, it's getting late.
[310:59.36]It is getting late.
[311:02.96]I probably should call it here soon.
[311:05.99]We'll pick up what we left off tomorrow anyways.
[311:10.23]Because we are getting... The internet's... Let me just make sure it's not me.
[311:26.14]I don't think it's me.
[311:33.09]No, it's not me.
[311:36.44]My upload is pretty stable at the moment.
[311:41.82]It's just connecting to Twitch.
[311:45.14]Don't ask me why.
[311:45.83]Oh well.
[311:54.58]Let's go check the inventory and everything.
[311:56.56]I know how to play.
[312:06.11]He's going to beat me this time.
[312:07.67]Hey, easy, man.
[312:08.93]Give me a second.
[312:12.43]You're supposed to be old.
[312:13.43]Why are you still this good?
[312:14.41]I can't even attack you.
[312:15.99]There we go.
[312:26.78]You guys said I couldn't be good at PUBG.
[312:28.52]Look at this.
[312:28.82]This is all the way across.
[312:31.54]This is over to a military base.
[312:34.52]Look at that.
[312:46.56]He's taking his aggression out on me.
[312:51.23]PUBG.
[312:55.70]Oh, you little dick.
[312:57.92]Come on, are you finally going to beat Dad?
[313:01.52]Nah, you're not going to beat dear old Dad.
[313:03.22]Sorry.
[313:06.97]The game is bad and I should feel bad for reference.
[313:08.81]I really... I don't think it's a bad game.
[313:10.87]Well, I mean... Here's the thing about the Battle Royale games.
[313:18.08]Everybody that I know that plays PUBG, Fortnite, H1, Z1, they always talk about how bad the games are.
[313:26.76]Like, oh, this game is trash.
[313:30.86]It's so bad.
[313:31.92]The fucking netcode sucks.
[313:33.48]Oh, the shotgun sucks.
[313:35.32]They always talk about how terrible the games are.
[313:38.16]Is that just like people just get mad at the game or something?
[313:46.93]Honestly, I really think PUBG is just a bad game.
[313:48.65]It feels incomplete.
[313:53.75]Frickin' Morty TV show rant.
[313:56.57]Hey, have some fucking yellow.
[313:57.45]Is that just like when you get mad at a game?
[314:04.09]Like, for instance, when I lose to Yahtzee in this game, and I'm like, Unbelievable!
[314:07.85]80% two times in a row?
[314:09.61]Fix the shotgun!
[314:10.91]Is that the same thing?
[314:12.39]I mean, it makes sense if it is.
[314:16.95]Audio is fine, but the video is very laggy.
[314:19.33]Yeah, I know.
[314:19.79]I'm sorry.
[314:22.13]Something about... I'm going to choose a different server tomorrow.
[314:24.67]Because... It's kind of been doing this off and on for like six straight hours.
[314:29.53]It's kind of annoying.
[314:32.35]Let's go back to town and see what we have for items.
[314:35.64]Let's just take a look.
[314:44.50]I'm going to call it here.
[314:46.83]It's getting to be like 1.30 in the morning.
[314:48.10]Let's see.
[314:52.48]Let's just go to the shrine.
[314:54.80]Let's put him on ice for a second.
[315:02.55]Well, I didn't mean to do that.
[315:10.39]So tomorrow, at some point, like we did this past stream here,
[315:17.03]I must really like this game from playing it for this long.
[315:20.27]I just used to play this when I was younger.
[315:21.85]I don't think I ever played Monster Rancher 2, but I played Monster Rancher 1 a lot.
[315:27.40]When I was like 15 or something.
[315:32.04]14.
[315:32.50]It's just fun to hang out and play it.
[315:34.50]And just talk and chill.
[315:37.60]I'm getting a lot of enjoyment from just hanging out.
[315:40.78]Hopefully it's interesting to watch.
[315:44.38]You know?
[315:46.33]Hopefully it's fun enough, right?
[315:48.41]But it is getting really late, and um... Especially for some of you EU guys, it's like 6 in the morning, 7 in the morning for some of you guys that are in EU.
[315:54.47]Uh... I feel like... I don't wanna keep going until like 2 AM here at Eastern.
[316:02.30]Even in like North America, that's fucking late.
[316:06.78]So tomorrow night, same time.
[316:08.70]Uh, expect between like... It's Sunday, so I don't know, maybe like 8 or 9 maybe, I'll start.
[316:17.46]And then I'm just gonna go tomorrow night around like, you know, whatever, whenever I start.
[316:23.67]Again, like, tonight.
[316:25.15]I might do like a six to eight hour stream tomorrow.
[316:27.67]Because if I'm gonna put this away for a little while, if we're gonna put Monster Rancher in the box for a little bit, then I'd like to play the hell out of it tomorrow night.
[316:40.38]So, let me just take a look at items first.
[316:48.22]Alright, so if we put in Cura.
[316:52.39]And... Just Lorax Brimley, just for fun.
[316:58.53]And Secret Seasoning.
[316:59.41]We got Flower.
[317:00.19]Can I do anything with a flower?
[317:03.65]Do you want to use this?
[317:04.35]Yes.
[317:06.39]Can't use this.
[317:06.95]This combination doesn't look good.
[317:09.99]Okay, well that's not good.
[317:11.13]How about Cura and Tin Allen?
[317:23.94]secret ingredient uh does it can I do anything with a gallo nut can't use that rock hound ripper allure what about cura and uh christy cream
[317:55.56]with a disk fragment.
[318:00.38]Let's see... This can be used as a secret seasoning.
[318:03.98]This combination doesn't look so good.
[318:06.43]Hey, we have a lot of bad combos, huh?
[318:12.11]We'll have to take a look later.
[318:19.25]So let's save it.
[318:21.33]I'll roll the credits here.
[318:22.87]Thanks for sticking around.
[318:23.55]It's gonna be the end of the stream.
[318:27.04]See you tomorrow if you're around.
[318:28.34]We're going to be doing this same game again for an indefinite amount of time tomorrow night.
[318:40.03]Edgehog would be a good combo.
[318:46.16]Maybe.
[318:48.00]But here we go.
[318:52.93]Wrap that up.
[318:54.41]Close that.
[318:56.45]Let's roll the sub and resub credits.
[319:01.25]Why not, right?
[319:03.05]Thank you to everybody that has participated in supporting the stream over the months.
[319:09.58]You guys are awesome.
[319:13.16]And now they're going way slower.
[319:16.12]I must have really sincerely decreased the time.
[319:19.92]I thought I increased the time.
[319:21.82]Hey, but look at all, I got all the time in the world now.
[319:25.24]Impossible for me to miss any of these names.
[319:28.42]It's not even possible.
[319:29.66]And I'm going to get every name correct.
[319:33.96]Jake Abob, thanks.

[320:20.18]I could do my nails.
[320:21.68]In fact, maybe I will.
[320:25.54]I lost my place.

[320:57.07]Thank you for subscribing or resubscribing to the channel.
[321:04.45]You rock.
[321:07.32]And now let's get to the bits.
[321:11.46]I fucked up.
[321:11.94]How did I fuck up?
[321:16.15]I didn't fuck up anything.
[321:22.06]Who did I fuck up?
[321:25.02]Sean?
[321:25.32]Sean?
[321:25.54]Sean?
[321:25.94]That was a perfect credits run.
[321:35.50]Comic block.
[321:36.42]Well, whatever.
[321:37.12]Sometimes you fuck up.
[321:41.47]Back down to earlier today.
[321:45.74]Let's start back here.
[321:48.86]Thank you, Hydra725, for the $1.
[321:51.08]Waddle dee, waddle doo, drink my pee, eat my poo.
[321:54.94]I missed you!
[321:55.58]Captain Snowman, did I miss you?
[321:57.24]How?
[321:58.19]That's not possible.
[322:01.07]I'm so terribly sorry if I did.
[322:06.77]CheeseKid26, thanks for the 30 cents.
[322:08.45]Please notice me, I have a message for you.
[322:11.11]Your grandpap.
[322:14.59]You said, what do you, your mom, what is this?
[322:19.80]You even like apologized at the end of this message.
[322:27.12]Like, he wrote this like crazy sentence of a bunch of crazy shit and then he was like, I'm so sorry about this.
[322:36.75]Thank you though.
[322:37.27]Thank you Prince Kenny for the 10 bucks.
[322:41.14]Jerma, I demand a $10 joke.
[322:43.86]I hope you got it, because that was five hours ago.
[322:46.08]But thank you so much, Prince Kenny, for the $10.
[322:50.75]A few resubs, including mine, didn't make the list, but still love you.
[322:53.35]I'm curious of how it works, because... I think...
[322:57.81]I think that that credit system only takes in people that subscribed or resubscribed during the stream.
[323:05.40]So if you subbed today, or if you subbed late last night into this morning, it wouldn't show up on there.
[323:12.18]That's only for people that subbed... Once I pressed the start streaming button, that's when it starts collecting the data.
[323:20.84]So if you did sub during the stream, then that's weird and it shouldn't be doing that.
[323:26.61]um that's what it's supposed to do but thanks a lot dude uh for your sub if I missed it I'm sorry I think my chat also died I resubbed during the stream but my name wasn't there that's weird yeah I don't know what oh you know no no no that's right okay yeah okay now I understand yep the stream had to restart
[323:53.14]So once the stream went down, the subs from before the last crash, yeah.
[323:58.16]I'm sorry about that.
[324:00.36]Now it makes sense.
[324:01.02]Yeah, it's from restarting the stream.
[324:08.19]Well, thank you to everybody, regardless.
[324:10.37]Sorry that after like an hour and 20 minutes, or two hours or so, some of you guys get cut off.
[324:18.38]But thank you anyways.
[324:23.13]Read donations when you get them.
[324:24.15]People might be more inclined to donate.
[324:26.77]Yeah, we've talked about this a bunch of times before, though.
[324:31.14]I don't like to pause and interrupt the stream.
[324:35.86]I don't like it.
[324:36.58]Well, let me rephrase that.
[324:38.80]If somebody gives like a hundred bucks, I'm not just going to be like, whatever, fuck that.
[324:44.68]But I like to focus on what's going on.
[324:48.20]Um, there's been much debate over this exact topic for months now.
[324:54.68]But, if I can catch him, I catch him.
[324:57.64]If not, then I like to just kind of focus on what's going on.
[325:01.68]And do it after the fact, or, um, if there's something important.
[325:06.04]Sometimes I glance over and I see some that are more than, you know, especially if they're more than 5, 10, 20 bucks sometimes, it's like, oh, Jesus, that's a lot of money.
[325:15.41]You're playing Monster Rancher, what is it, or Interrupt?
[325:19.67]It's not even about interrupting the stream, it's just about... When I, like, get in the flow, in quotes, like, when I start to, like, stream... I can get really distracted and pulling myself away from what I'm talking about or what I'm doing.
[325:33.01]It's very easy for me to lose pace and lose track of anything I'm fucking doing.
[325:39.15]So...
[325:40.58]And I think it lets the stream flow a little more, because if you think about it, right?
[325:45.92]Donations and subs.
[325:48.19]We sit here at the end and we go over pretty much every single bit donation that happens through the whole stream.
[325:54.89]And it takes about 40...
[325:58.98]It takes about like 45 minutes to an hour at the end of every stream.
[326:02.44]So if you're talking about like a four to five hour stream and like 45 minutes of that is like talking about donations implanted throughout the stream, it kind of like drags out the actual streaming content in a way.
[326:16.29]Because you get to talk about potentially like 30 to 40, 50 minutes of just talking about donations.
[326:25.24]And plus, for YouTube as well, I'm not sure if you knew or not, but almost every one of my streams is edited onto YouTube.
[326:36.10]And to make it easier, to make it flow better, especially for Holy Mac, who does all the editing.
[326:44.41]It flows much better instead of him having to cut between me talking to people or accepting donations or talking about subs.
[326:51.84]If something's going on to the screen and he can get like a good highlight from it, then it would be hard for him to kind of dance around other shit that's going on, you know what I'm saying?
[327:06.60]problem with bit donations at the end is many donations are within a certain context and reading them at the end takes them all out of context yeah it does it does but I've I've it's a rock and a hard place because I I would love to do that I would love to do uh to acknowledge everything that comes in the second it comes in
[327:32.54]But I... I don't know.
[327:34.48]I think I've made the decision.
[327:37.45]And when people donate, you know, it still pops up on the screen, right?
[327:41.85]It shows the person that subscribed or the person that... whatever message they had.
[327:48.95]It's on the top of the area.
[327:50.39]You can see who wrote it.
[327:51.37]I mean, people can still see it.
[327:54.07]It's just I don't reference a bit donation in the middle of the stream.
[328:00.63]There's drawbacks to both of them.
[328:05.67]Like, the way that currently works is fine.
[328:09.18]Yeah.
[328:12.20]And then there's also the thing, well, why don't you just do text-to-speech?
[328:15.14]Oh, God, no.
[328:17.53]No way.
[328:18.31]Absolutely not.
[328:20.11]Text-to-speech just dominates and takes over the entire stream.
[328:24.63]And it gets to a point where... It's not even... It's just, like, people talking over your stream, you know what I mean?
[328:32.73]You get that girl, that, like, default text-to-speech girl... And it's just like... And the guy's, like, the guy's talking into the camera.
[328:41.88]And it's like two people are talking at the same time.
[328:46.96]And yeah, would I make more money?
[328:49.60]Probably.
[328:51.16]Would I make a shitload more money on Twitch if I in real time allowed a bunch of text-to-speech donations and encouraged subscriptions and said, hey, let's run a fucking sub train!
[329:03.91]I don't, like, I could do that, but I don't, I don't care.
[329:06.49]I don't want to.
[329:09.09]I told you guys before, I don't want to gamify paying me money on the internet.
[329:14.34]I would rather it just come naturally to the both of us.
[329:17.04]If you want to pay money, if you want to give me money, I'm not gonna, I can't stop you, right?
[329:22.14]And I appreciate the fact that you fucking would ever do that for me.
[329:25.36]But I don't want it to get to a point where you're essentially gamifying a stream monetarily.
[329:38.02]Make text-to-speech for $100 only.
[329:40.02]But that's what I'm saying, like, I don't want to do that.
[329:44.74]Be yourself, otherwise why the fuck am I watching you and not any... That's what I'm saying.
[329:48.09]I... No.
[329:54.29]Begging on stream.
[329:57.65]You will never see text-to-speech donations and I will never gamify subs.
[330:04.15]And look, people can do what they want to do.
[330:05.71]I'm not gonna stand on a- I'm not gonna push forward a fucking soapbox and stand on it.
[330:11.78]But I just personally would rather it be something that's on the off- on the side there, rather than the focus of the whole stream is getting paid money.
[330:25.10]Right?
[330:32.70]Make chat text-to-speech.
[330:38.74]Text-to-speech as a joke parody stream.
[330:40.95]You understand, like, if I do a joke parody stream, can you imagine if I turned on text-to-speech and I just let it run wild?
[330:49.87]You would probably just look at the amount of money that would come through and you'd be like, what in the name of fucking God is happening?
[330:56.66]It would fucking, it would fuck with me.
[330:59.90]You know, sometimes I make a bunch of money on these streams.
[331:01.92]Even look at like the last couple of nights.
[331:03.08]You can see it up top.
[331:03.88]You can see how much money I've made in the last two days, three days.
[331:06.92]That's a lot of fucking money.
[331:10.84]I can't imagine if it was like five times that.
[331:13.51]It would be... I wouldn't know what to do with myself.
[331:15.65]It would be fucking weird.
[331:23.53]Pre-recorded bit with a fake text-to-speech.
[331:25.31]That would be kind of funny.
[331:34.23]BRB stream.
[331:39.32]Buy Vive.
[331:41.76]I think that's turning into its own joke at this point, that I still haven't bought fucking Vive.
[331:45.54]But I have.
[331:46.54]You don't know.
[331:47.20]Wait a minute.
[331:47.98]Oh, could he be lying there?
[331:50.82]Move out of the basement?
[331:51.76]I don't live in the basement.
[331:52.96]I just stream there.
[331:59.49]Have chat run in text-to-speech, then control the game with speech-to-text.
[332:04.44]That would be fucking funny.
[332:08.84]But anyways.
[332:12.88]Let's keep moving.
[332:15.56]We talk about it sometimes.
[332:19.39]But yeah.
[332:19.75]I thought it was an office, not a basement.
[332:24.11]It's a basement.
[332:24.93]It's an office basement.
[332:25.75]It's an office in the basement.
[332:31.06]But thank you for all your support, everybody.
[332:36.18]Um... Thank you, Crodon, for the $1.
[332:39.90]I missed the Paul Bearer subsound in Orson Welles, but that was before the plague hit.
[332:43.54]Sorry, I couldn't help it.
[332:45.04]That's alright.
[332:46.42]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[332:47.68]Sounds disappointing.
[332:49.33]The 985 sounds... was disappointing.
[332:52.49]Just like you.
[332:54.97]Hey, come on, man.
[332:55.49]Come on.
[332:56.57]You'll be alright, man.
[332:58.24]Hey, NatKitty, thanks for the $1.
[333:00.20]The Tim Allen sub sound needs to happen.
[333:02.21]It will.
[333:04.25]Probably not tomorrow.
[333:06.25]But I will put that on for like at least a week.
[333:07.89]And then, I mean, my sub sound is currently a Hearthstone sound.
[333:14.04]I didn't even play Hearthstone that much to begin with, and I have a Hearthstone card that came out like three years ago in an expansion as my sub sound.
[333:21.44]And the BF.
[333:25.48]But yes, I will change them.
[333:28.23]Uh, Colelegacy, thanks for the five bucks.
[333:30.13]Shamrock, Shamrock, Shamrock, Shamrock.
[333:31.93]Use the Home Improvement Season 1 DVD to summon a Monster Rancher 3.
[333:35.05]It won't let you down.
[333:35.89]I... Good idea.
[333:38.65]You better believe when we get Monster Rancher 3, I'm gonna have a ton of fucked up DVDs.
[333:47.18]Thank you, Bill.
[333:47.58]Thank you, TechnoToast for the 75 cents.
[333:49.30]Return the dab or suffer my curse.
[333:57.24]That card is rotating out in a month.
[334:07.98]Something about that, I think, is really funny.
[334:11.89]But, uh, thank you, TechnoToast, appreciate it.
[334:14.93]And Polo Juice, 100 bucks earlier, we referenced it already, but thank you so much.
[334:22.27]It's a lot of money.
[334:25.29]Frogman, thank you Frogman Savage for the hundred fucking butts.
[334:28.53]The hundred butts.
[334:31.89]Yeah, that was like two hundred dollar donations in a row.
[334:36.86]It's insane.
[334:42.94]Unbelievable.
[334:43.74]Thank you guys.
[334:46.84]What system is Monster Rancher 4 on?
[334:48.71]Is it on PS2?
[334:51.62]Kroden, thanks for the $1.
[334:52.48]Yeah, we got this already about the WWE.
[334:55.48]BB has become a WWE villain.
[334:57.18]Zero fans.
[334:57.82]Only in it for the money.
[334:58.50]That's true.
[335:01.34]PiePie526, thanks for the $10.
[335:03.96]You're alright with me, man.
[335:05.22]I don't care what Italic says.
[335:09.78]What did he say?
[335:12.08]Oh, my drama.
[335:15.36]Thank you, PiePie, for the $10.
[335:17.04]Appreciate it.
[335:18.10]SmellyBoy11, thanks for the $1.
[335:19.48]Hey, Jerma.
[335:19.90]He, he, he, we, we, pee, pee.
[335:25.80]Yeah, that was how- you did- you had to spend a dollar to say that.
[335:33.40]You know what I mean?
[335:33.92]Like, you had to say that.
[335:35.46]That was a dollar.
[335:36.38]That was one dollar for you to say, hee-hee, wee-wee, pee-pee.
[335:44.72]Void space.
[335:45.42]Thanks for the five bucks here, dude.
[335:48.42]Jerma, I just want you to know how much you affect us all and how much you make my life more bearable.
[335:53.66]You're a fantastic man and you are one of the few things that make me happy.
[335:56.91]Wish I could give more because no amount could show the gratitude I have for you and what you've done for us all.
[336:01.83]You're a truly great person and I wish you the best.
[336:05.97]Thank you so much, Boyd.
[336:09.96]I hope... I hope... I can continue to do that.
[336:18.92]Because that's extremely important to me.
[336:21.06]So thank you so much, Boyd.
[336:22.10]Appreciate it, dude.
[336:24.91]The Great Lord Walden gave $100.
[336:27.39]Again, he's hit the Tim Allen E-E-U-U-G-G-G-A-A-A-A-H-H-H with question marks.
[336:36.06]Thank you so much, Walden.
[336:38.76]Big Mama thanks for the $5.
[336:39.73]The McRib only at McDonald's.
[336:45.25]That's right.
[336:46.43]You can't buy that sandwich anywhere else.
[336:50.07]You can't buy that run-over tire mark ground-up eyeball sandwich at any other establishment.
[336:57.21]It's true.
[337:00.55]Zero, thanks for the 65 cents.
[337:01.97]Somebody yesterday suggested Dragon Quest Monsters is a great monster-raising game for the Game Boy, but warned that they weren't very streamable.
[337:13.00]I would suggest instead Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 1 or Joker 2 for the DS.
[337:20.05]which runs great in an emulator and works with a capture card.
[337:22.41]Even though it's a DS game, it actually has better graphics than this game.
[337:26.85]And that is... That has a ton of great looking monsters.
[337:32.59]I gotta, like, write these down and get some of these.
[337:35.05]Some of these are interesting.
[337:41.17]I like my eyeball sandwich every once in a while.
[337:42.97]Yeah, every once in a while, but you know what it is.
[337:47.93]Yeah, the thing about video games that I think a lot of people... The thing about video games... There's a lot of them.
[337:57.38]There's a ton of them.
[337:59.20]Some of them you may not have ever even heard before in your whole life.
[338:04.80]I'd like to see as many as I can.
[338:10.15]So, I'm definitely worth... I'm not worth, I'm definitely down to try worthwhile old games.
[338:20.88]Some of them you only play.
[338:25.60]Ding dong, your opinion is wrong.
[338:27.48]What?
[338:30.90]I don't think your opinion's wrong.
[338:32.28]People said Joker wasn't good.
[338:35.44]The Joker is great.
[338:36.28]Dark Knight is the best fucking movie out of all three of them.
[338:39.42]So don't listen to what these guys are saying.
[338:41.24]Batman Begins was not even good.
[338:46.28]Dark Knight Rises was not even good.
[338:49.33]Bane plays football for a couple hours.
[338:51.93]And he talks with a bunch of food in his mouth.
[338:54.53]The Joker is the best movie out of the whole series.
[339:10.66]hey wow not true debate me on stream debate me the joker movie that movie was good I'm just kidding they're all good it's just the joker is the best one critical corn thanks for the one dollar no what the fudge it was 10 bucks thank you critical corn for the 10 bucks
[339:42.27]That is a dollar times ten.
[339:44.91]Jeremiah, me and my friends are going to go on a road trip from Atlanta to Boston to see you at PAX East, but will you only be able to be there on Thursday?
[339:51.47]Will you be there, and can we stop and say hi?
[339:54.77]P.S.
[339:55.13]Want anything from Georgia?
[339:58.44]Um, ah, Thursday.
[340:00.00]I don't know if I'm going to be there.
[340:04.58]I think I should be there on Thursday.
[340:08.70]Oh, here.
[340:08.96]Here's a spoiler alert, guys.
[340:10.08]Sorry.
[340:10.85]By the way, I need to get a badge for PAX.
[340:15.99]I completely fucking forgot to get a badge.
[340:19.01]So if I don't get a badge, I'm just gonna be hanging out in the lobby for four days.
[340:24.12]I'm gonna be getting, like, a coffee and sitting down using my iPad in the lobby.
[340:28.44]Like, for four hours every day.
[340:36.56]I'll get it.
[340:37.09]Don't worry.
[340:43.23]Now I have to be there.
[340:44.33]If you're driving from Georgia, that means I have to be there.
[340:52.41]Order it.
[340:53.49]They have a bunch still?
[340:54.47]Yeah, okay.
[340:57.63]Come up and find me.
[341:00.21]That's like... Am I fighting somebody?
[341:02.56]Why don't you come find me?
[341:05.62]That wasn't supposed to sound as combat as it was.
[341:10.04]Yeah.
[341:10.78]Hopefully I'll run into you.
[341:14.47]You have to make sure you introduce yourself as guy that I drove from Georgia.
[341:19.25]And I'll be like, but the guy from Georgia!
[341:22.11]The guy that drove from Georgia!
[341:23.85]Unbelievable!
[341:24.73]I can't believe it!
[341:25.49]And we'll, like, shake hands.
[341:27.81]It's unbelievable!
[341:33.19]Thank you to Freudian Weapon for the ten bucks.
[341:37.71]I think you look great.
[341:41.93]Thank you.
[341:44.43]Appreciate that.
[341:50.33]Foisted.
[341:51.29]Foisted.

[341:55.74]And I appreciate the kind words.
[342:00.64]Cheese it up, thanks for the $1.
[342:02.22]He'll never be anything like Sweet Rind.
[342:05.18]Well, unfortunately, Sweet Rind is no longer with us.
[342:10.49]Jacob Bob, thanks for the $1.10.
[342:12.15]Local streamer gets stoned with a dog.
[342:17.59]Yeah.
[342:19.01]Corey Gaming, thanks for the five bucks.
[342:20.37]Sorry, Jerma Twitch doesn't let me donate fries anymore.
[342:22.57]You'll have to get your own.
[342:25.04]That's fucking bullshit.
[342:27.64]They should be able to take any kind of currency.
[342:29.42]French fries are a currency.
[342:34.24]Remember that cheat monster that died?
[342:38.70]Take a trip to Arizona for a con of some kind?
[342:41.63]I love Arizona.
[342:43.79]And I've never even been there.
[342:47.94]I'm serious.
[342:48.50]I like Arizona.
[342:50.14]I've never even stepped foot in the state.
[342:51.80]I've been in Nevada.
[342:55.30]Nevada's pretty much Arizona.
[342:56.82]They're the same shape.
[342:59.22]They're both deserty.
[343:02.02]I'd like it.
[343:10.21]But anyways, thank you to Vincessity for the $1.
[343:12.51]Hey, Jeremiah, have you ever thought about streaming old, trashy Flash games from Newgrounds?
[343:17.42]Well, if you were here last week, we played a handful of shitty Flash games.
[343:23.44]Some of them were from Newgrounds.
[343:26.46]But not, um... Not in a grand scheme, no.
[343:30.71]Not in a grand way.
[343:32.65]Maybe... Ah!
[343:34.67]What am I doing?
[343:35.95]Maybe eventually, maybe some point down the road, yeah.
[343:39.41]And Adam, thanks for the 50 cents.
[343:40.63]Roses are red, violets are blue, Jermas are furry, pee-pee-poo-poo.

[343:51.37]Like, mm-hmm.
[343:52.37]The pee-pee-poo-poo part, because, like, that was, like, mm-hmm.
[343:56.87]I'm not an anthropod, guys.
[343:58.65]You know what I'm saying?
[344:02.74]I'm a human.

[346:37.11]So, that is big money.
[346:38.89]Thanks, dude.
[346:40.13]And then right after that, we have fifty dollars from Cairo Toby.
[346:46.62]Kairotobi, I don't know, how the fuck did I miss this?

[347:18.40]No, we didn't just start.
[347:21.47]Twitch is replaying the end of the VOD.
[347:26.05]Wait, what's going on?
[347:31.43]Twitch is streaming.
[347:33.14]I'm talking on myself.
[347:40.68]There's two streams going at the same time.
[347:50.68]What?
