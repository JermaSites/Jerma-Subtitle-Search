[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.26]Okay.
[00:02.08]We're going to go next.
[00:03.16]We're going to play the worst game of the whole night.
[00:05.48]Hold on.
[00:05.72]Let me get it ready.
[00:09.46]Let me just... Let me just get it ready.
[00:14.90]This is the worst game of the... We're going to instantly next.
[00:19.14]This is the fucking worst game.
[00:22.09]Yeah.
[00:26.09]Alright.
[00:26.29]To be honest, what do you think the worst one so far has been?
[00:29.91]I'm going to go with...
[00:32.26]I'm going to go with Tony Hawk.
[00:35.82]What do you think?
[00:37.20]Oh, no, I'm going to go with this one.
[00:38.80]Because that's the easiest decision of the whole night.
[00:43.53]Somebody said it.
[00:44.55]Actually, that one's not here.
[00:45.83]It's not Dota.
[00:51.87]It's a PlayStation 3 game.
[00:55.29]Well, it's a Square Enix game.
[00:56.87]That much we know.
[00:59.92]It's a Feel Plus Incorporated.
[01:03.31]It's not Haze.
[01:07.97]It's Mindjack.
[01:08.99]You still happy we moved away from Dead to Rights?
[01:23.70]Oh boy.
[01:28.05]And it's funny you say Haze, because Haze... Haze is next!
[01:34.61]Here we go!
[01:35.07]There's one more in between.
[01:40.58]We'll get one more in between.
[01:50.58]There you go, it's going pretty well.
[01:52.54]Hopefully Euro Day is going good too.
[01:57.10]This is a game where you Jack into people's brains and you take over their minds.
[02:01.04]And it's in like 340p.
[02:01.74]Haze.
[02:02.08]Haze, yeah.
[02:02.48]Haze was supposed to be the PlayStation 3, like, Halo.
[02:06.50]Ah!
[02:06.64]What the f- Why do you have a 56k modem blaring in my ear?
[02:29.42]This can't be this ugly.
[02:33.47]I'd like to get out of this place.
[02:34.47]What were you going to move?
[03:01.09]Wait, I was looking over at the chat room.
[03:02.97]What am I supposed to do?
[03:11.51]You guys asked for this.
[03:12.55]You wanted to get out of Dead to Rights.
[03:13.85]Alright, warp near your target using L1 or R1.
[03:24.12]We're going to take over this like random dad at his computer.
[03:33.53]Okay.
[03:33.89]What am I supposed to do?
[03:36.81]Oh my god, my internet's like breaking again.
[03:39.27]What a perfect game to break on.
[03:40.71]Hey, what are you talking about?
[03:47.01]R2.
[03:56.26]Uh... Well...
[03:59.53]R2 doesn't do anything.
[04:05.93]R2 doesn't do anything.
[04:07.99]Wait, hold on.
[04:09.85]Just a minute.
[04:11.29]I think I might have a solution.
[04:12.69]Give me one second.
[04:24.75]Do I have a solution?
[04:27.57]This thing's currently plugged in.
[04:29.75]Right?
[04:30.05]Hold on, I can turn this one off.
[04:35.13]Nothing's gonna work.
[04:35.99]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[04:39.87]Hold on.
[04:44.22]Come on.
[04:47.50]Come on, make this the main controller.
[04:51.28]Come on, you bag of shit.
[04:55.69]Ugh.
[04:58.33]No, nothing's gonna work.
[04:59.51]Of course not.
[05:01.81]R2 doesn't fucking work on a DualShock 4.
[05:03.83]And my DualShock 3, I threw it into the ground because it broke.
[05:11.06]Give me a fucking break.
[05:14.66]No, I have to, like, quit the game.
[05:16.14]And then, like, load it back up.
[05:19.56]No, I don't.
[05:21.32]Hold on.
[05:26.55]Make this controller one.
[05:30.58]Get the fuck back in there.
[05:32.40]Got it!
[05:37.54]What do I do?
[05:37.92]I don't know what to do.
[05:47.48]Hacked it.
[05:51.32]Where am I?
[05:56.03]No, I don't want to be back in this...
[06:00.31]I don't want to be back in this.
[06:02.11]Get me out of here.
[06:02.79]Alright, go.
[06:06.53]Get out.
[06:09.12]Where, what terminal?
[06:09.76]Which one?
[06:10.08]This one?
[06:15.30]Can I please get out of hell?
[06:18.70]Mine hack the terminal.
[06:25.05]Thank god, we get two achievements.
[06:35.48]Campaign setup options.
[06:37.76]Just get going here.
[06:39.24]New game.
[06:45.30]Plug in.
[06:54.01]I skipped somebody's bits.
[06:55.29]Wait, what?
[06:55.95]Where?
[06:59.91]Let me see.
[07:11.93]Oh, shit, I did.
[07:13.54]Gunther?
[07:14.84]Gunther Hute.
[07:16.94]Thank you for the $5.
[07:18.56]Hey, Jeremiah, how are you?
[07:19.36]PS, please say, fuck you, Halo.
[07:22.12]It's cool, we're friends.
[07:25.37]I hope so.
[07:27.31]Because I just read it.
[07:30.19]But thank you for the $5, dude.
[07:37.40]Alright, just skip this.
[07:45.82]I'm sick of looking at this.
[07:53.18]That's me.
[07:55.12]Oh no.
[07:55.74]I'm sorry.
[07:56.18]I didn't mean it.
[08:03.48]Who cares about any of this shit?
[08:04.76]We got like four cutscenes.
[08:08.91]Why does a memory have screen tearing?
[08:10.67]Alright, good, here we go!
[08:11.83]Mindjack!
[08:14.11]Here I am!
[08:16.05]Get in close to an object and press X in cover to get in cover.
[08:18.60]That's the same protagonist!
[08:29.81]Where am I supposed to go?
[08:30.81]Don't give me a walking first mission.
[08:41.25]Oh, man.
[08:46.35]I have to walk.
[08:47.39]It's one of those... Everybody wanted to make a Half-Life 2.
[08:51.47]Everybody did.
[08:54.63]Remember in Half-Life 2 when you picked up the can of soda?
[08:58.67]You threw it in the trash can a thousand times?
[09:00.51]Everybody wants to redo that.
[09:02.39]And here we are.
[09:06.13]Thank goodness.
[09:11.98]Remember, we skip every single cutscene.
[09:14.63]No matter what the cost is.
[09:19.31]Speedrun strat.
[09:20.93]We need to do the strategies here because there's no run.
[09:24.27]We have to dodge roll to cutscene to cutscene.
[09:27.40]Fuck, my internet's dying again.
[09:28.72]God damn it.
[09:29.58]Stop it.
[09:36.20]It's on Mindjack.
[09:38.55]What the?
[09:42.75]I win.
[09:42.99]That's it.
[09:53.44]What?
[09:55.10]Do you wish to allow other hackers who are online to break into the story you are about to begin playing?
[10:02.83]Sure.
[10:06.23]You can set break-in access for other players by selecting setup from the host portal hacker limit.
[10:15.42]Okay.
[10:17.94]Come at me.
[10:20.14]Zero players.
[10:21.44]Because no one would ever own this game still and still be playing it right now.
[10:25.00]Watch there be like a bunch of people still playing online.
[10:29.48]Hold on.
[10:29.66]Is this like Dark Souls Invasions before Dark Souls?
[10:32.11]Which came out first?
[10:32.79]This or Mindjack?
[10:34.95]When did Mindjack come out?
[10:41.33]I can't even tell.
[10:41.99]I don't know.
[10:45.10]Alright, I forgot.
[10:45.68]We have to skip every cutscene.
[10:48.04]How do I minejack?
[10:51.66]Female located!
[10:53.06]I love when it shoots me.
[11:04.19]Mineslave?
[11:09.41]Okay, well, wait.
[11:12.23]Well, the guy died before I could do anything.
[11:13.93]What about this guy?
[11:20.22]I can't... I can't do anything.
[11:23.66]Is my guy just standing still right now?
[11:28.26]Somebody's playing the game for me.
[11:34.31]Alright, well, I'm playing as the girl now.
[11:36.23]Alright, I transferred my brain.
[11:37.65]Uh, this...
[11:49.56]This is... This is... awful!
[11:58.90]Huh?
[11:59.18]I feel like I gotta go hack my... I gotta go hack me.
[12:02.72]And then revive... Why is this game called Mindjacket?
[12:10.18]I should be able to take over people's minds.
[12:18.79]Look, it's a kill feed.
[12:22.63]I have a pretend kill feed.
[12:26.01]That's unbelievable.
[12:30.01]Get over the grenade!
[12:36.34]Make players think that they have a kill feed.
[12:43.22]Okay, I guess I can make like an army.
[12:46.74]This next?
[12:47.24]Nope.
[12:49.59]not happening sorry guys we're staying here for at least 40 minutes this is mobile one wow what the hell is going on all I know is someone wants us dead us you you me us think they give a damn this was supposed to be an easy mission
[13:17.88]How much money do you think these guys got paid to do this?
[13:21.67]It was way too much.
[13:38.08]Like, whatever these guys get paid, I would have done this for like 30% less money.
[13:43.02]I would have undercut these actors.
[13:44.42]I would have been the female, too.
[13:52.38]You can't get to be more of a generic shooter than this.
[14:00.69]This might be the worst game I've played on-screen.
[14:05.93]In fact, it absolutely is the worst game I've ever played on-screen.
[14:13.63]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[14:18.97]Look at this music.
[14:26.10]I feel like I'm playing an old, like, 1993 space-shooting first-person, like, DOS game.
[14:33.33]Like, Descent.
[14:36.15]Oh, is it?
[14:36.45]Is it?
[14:36.79]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[14:37.83]Oh, I got a grenade.
[14:46.12]I don't know how to get back in his brain.
[14:52.46]Okay, wait.
[14:52.92]I'm inside of this soldier now.
[14:56.58]Do I have to play on the other side?
[14:57.74]Okay, I get to beat this guy.
[15:05.76]What about you?
[15:06.22]Can I take over your brain?
[15:08.53]No.
[15:11.67]I'm about to mute this shit.
[15:16.77]I don't blame you, I really don't.
[15:27.17]Who the fuck made this game?
[15:29.71]Oh, Feel Good Inc.
[15:30.85]I forgot whatever the name is.
[15:35.95]What's the name?
[15:36.41]What is the name of the game?
[15:38.03]What's the name of the game?
[15:39.63]Oh, it's like an old Flash game that has this exact music.
[15:53.33]Oh god, this guy.
[15:54.87]Can I like mind hack a dog?
[15:56.95]Oh fuck.
[16:04.51]What happened there?
[16:07.52]I gotta get out of here.
[16:08.54]I have to get out of here.
[16:10.08]I can't do it.
[16:11.64]It's actually giving me motion sickness.
[16:17.60]I'm not kidding.
[16:18.16]I'm actually going to throw up playing this game.
[16:22.40]The music and the mechanics and the gunplay sucks.
[16:29.80]I can't do it.
[16:42.51]This music, my eyes got chills.
[16:48.57]Oh god.
[17:02.44]I can't.
[17:06.12]I gotta get out of here.
[17:07.17]I really do.
[17:08.01]I'm sorry.
[17:08.37]Wait, mind hack this guy.
[17:12.61]He's like a random civilian.
[17:16.75]Got into my hands now.
[17:21.53]Can he do anything else?
[17:26.16]You would think that if you had this as a mechanic, it would be, like, cool to do this.
[17:38.01]Okay.
[17:39.95]I got... Alright, we did it.
[17:41.11]We had fun.
[17:42.63]This is a fun game.
[17:55.40]No, no, I'm done.
[17:57.00]I'm done with that one.
[17:58.64]Sorry.
[18:02.48]Like, it's got to go.
[18:06.78]I apologize.
[18:07.72]It can't still be there.
[18:08.85]Okay, let's get this one in there.
[18:12.71]Ooh, I don't know if we're going to be able to play a haze.
[18:26.22]I don't think Hayes is going to work.
[18:27.56]I think Hayes needs a huge install that I didn't do.
[18:35.74]Well, it's alright.
[18:39.18]It's okay.
[18:48.25]Unprepared?
[18:48.91]Well, Tony Hawk took a long time.
[18:50.97]Actually, it might not be.
[18:51.63]I think it's ready to go.
[18:55.92]That looks ready to go, right?
[19:01.81]Just go all in on Haze?
[19:04.55]I feel like I don't want to go all in on Haze.
[19:07.79]Considering... The game saves data automatically.
[19:11.96]Yes.
[19:12.42]PlayStation 3.
[19:13.16]Go for it.
[19:14.00]Hey!
[19:14.52]There it is.
[19:17.46]I have to pee so bad.
[19:18.44]I've held my pee this whole time.
[19:25.29]So let me pee.
[19:28.80]And we will do H. Be right back.
[22:16.09]Alright.
[22:20.85]Don't be mad.
[22:22.71]Don't be mad at me.
[22:26.41]There's an install.
[22:29.90]It's not going to take very long.
[22:31.22]I've only got two minutes.
[22:34.86]And it's already at like 40%.
[22:35.58]Everything's going to be fine.
[22:41.28]Look, I'll turn my face game on so you can see my Gary Oldman fifth element here.
[22:48.54]We can hang out for a minute.
[22:57.69]There it is.
[22:58.81]Haze.
[23:04.15]Do this shit on PS4?
[23:06.35]PS4 doesn't really have a whole lot of crazy games.
[23:09.99]Remember, this is back in the era where every movie had a licensed game.
[23:16.84]there are there are hundreds there are hundreds and hundreds of PlayStation 3 games it's kind of insane sponsored by blue apron the hell are you talking about hayes sold better than mind Jack I would assume it did because it was like a launch title I think
[23:47.32]I'm balding?
[23:48.54]Oh no, I know I am.
[23:51.72]I know that.
[23:53.08]Usually my hair goes like this.
[23:55.85]Not today.
[23:58.17]I got out of the shower.
[24:00.23]I explained this like an hour or two ago.
[24:01.63]But I got out of the shower and I just like kind of combed it.
[24:04.64]And just let it sit there wet.
[24:06.26]And it kind of just turned to shit.
[24:07.52]So I didn't really care.
[24:10.94]Isn't Blue Apron, the Blue Apron thing where they send you a bunch of ingredients and you make, you make like food with the random like raw shit that they send you?
[24:22.57]Something like that?
[24:29.07]Yeah.
[24:30.17]Isn't it really expensive too?
[24:31.31]Can't you just go to the grocery store and buy like a piece of salmon?
[24:35.09]I mean, I get it.
[24:35.63]I get it.
[24:36.27]Look, if you... I was thinking about doing it.
[24:39.11]It seemed like a pretty interesting idea.
[24:40.61]Like, hello, fresh blue apron, like those things.
[24:43.99]But, like, it's a lot of money to have them send that shit to you.
[24:50.54]Why don't you just go to the store and buy, like, a bag of macaroni, some parsley, a little bit of basil, some pesto sauce, a piece of salmon, and preheat the oven to 425°F.
[25:04.08]Sprinkle the parsley on top of the salmon.
[25:05.61]Get a little bit of salmon rub.
[25:06.73]Rub it down.
[25:08.07]It's perfect.
[25:08.49]Look, word for word, take my recipe.
[25:11.75]Parsley into the pan.
[25:14.40]Stop it down.
[25:16.14]See ya.
[25:18.85]You're done.
[25:21.38]I was gonna just do, like, a Gordon Ramsay impression, but I forgot my Gordon Ramsay impression's not that good, so I froze.
[25:28.06]And then I, like, forgot my throat hurt, so that wasn't gonna happen.
[25:31.64]I just froze.
[25:32.08]I legit just, like, froze on stage.
[25:34.21]Like, I was a fucking four-year-old at a school play.
[25:38.09]Listen to me.
[25:38.53]I sound like I'm fucking dying.
[25:43.07]Salmon.
[25:43.69]Tasteless.
[25:44.91]In the pan.
[25:46.41]Parsley.
[25:47.68]See ya.
[25:50.28]25 minutes.
[25:51.54]Turn it over.
[25:52.78]Leave it alone.
[25:54.20]Yeah, there you go.
[25:54.74]That's my shitty Gordon Ramsay impression.
[25:59.57]A grilling stream?
[26:00.47]I don't know anything about grilling.
[26:07.03]I tried, yeah.
[26:10.59]I'm gonna be the only fucking guy at TwitchCon that shows up with a fucked up voice.
[26:14.96]Before being a Twi- Wow, this is getting bad.
[26:24.51]Sounds like Christopher Walken.
[26:28.79]I, you know, I thought about doing a cooking stream where like I set my house on fire as like a joke on like a set.
[26:32.90]I just ruined the whole thing for you.
[26:34.50]Whoops.
[26:37.17]I was gonna make a video a long time ago where, like, I did a cooking show.
[26:41.23]This is, like, one of the flop ideas that might happen, but here's the entire story, so here you go.
[26:46.58]I was gonna do a video where I did a cooking stream, or a cooking video, where we make a fake kitchen, like a fake set.
[26:55.14]And over the course of the video, I'm just ruining shit.
[26:57.85]Like, I'm burning the ovens, like, smoking and shit like that.
[27:01.03]And I'm talking about making, like, a salmon.
[27:03.09]And I'm just blowing off the fact that, like, the house is going to burn down.
[27:05.91]And I'm just like, forget about it.
[27:07.35]Don't worry about it.
[27:09.21]That's pretty normal.
[27:10.03]Like, there's just, like, pillowing black smoke coming out of the oven.
[27:14.32]And, like, I don't turn the cameras off and we keep going.
[27:16.42]And eventually, like, the whole place starts to burn up.
[27:19.42]And the video ends because an axe comes through the back of the wall.
[27:22.60]Like, the wall.
[27:24.03]And it's, like, the fire department is there to, like, come get me out of the house.
[27:27.95]And I, like, the show is still being shot.
[27:32.43]Like, I cared so much about my, like, shitty cooking show that I'm not, like, leaving my house.
[27:39.03]That was gonna be, like, the end of the video.
[27:41.40]Like, literally, like, I'm just, like, still going over the food and, like, there's, like, black smoke everywhere and it's, like, not even phasing me.
[27:46.98]It's, like, not even happening.
[27:49.54]And then you just see, like, crash, like, through the fucking back drywall.
[27:57.22]Yeah.
[28:00.36]You wish I... I wish I made it too.
[28:01.82]$3,000 video probably was going to cost more than that because I would need to get, like, the town involved because I don't think... You can't just... Well, don't worry.
[28:16.54]There's plenty of other ideas.
[28:17.58]There's plenty of other things.
[28:20.02]Plenty more video ideas that you'll probably see, hopefully.
[28:27.15]Is this still going?
[28:27.91]Like how long did it take to install this game?
[28:31.38]I look like a guy that eats a lot of tacos.
[28:32.94]Well, you know what?
[28:35.68]You're kind of right.
[28:36.82]I do eat a lot of tacos.
[28:39.12]I'm a big fan.
[28:43.30]You don't have to have a real fireman show up.
[28:46.71]I mean, if I'm going to make like a controlled burn on a set, like you got, there has to be like, somebody has to be there.
[28:58.54]I'm not going to see any of my ideas at my current upload rate of zero.
[29:02.58]Well, there's a lot of... Look.
[29:04.24]To make... To make a bunch of these videos... To make one of these videos, it's going to cost a ton of money.
[29:11.62]Like, I... To make even like Jerma Rumble live, right?
[29:16.22]It was a shitload of money.
[29:17.82]You have to pay so many people that's involved in those projects.
[29:21.38]Like, just having like three guys with cameras...
[29:25.31]Just that, just to hire like camera crew is just, it's fucking like hundreds of dollars a day when you shoot.
[29:32.93]It's a ton of fucking money.
[29:33.89]And that's just, that's just hiring like the random crew.
[29:36.60]Forget about bringing anybody else in.
[29:37.86]Forget about like paying actors and shit.
[29:39.98]It's a lot of money.
[29:42.26]That way you heard none of that.
[29:43.16]What do you mean?
[29:45.08]The internet died for a second?
[29:46.06]Oh, I was like, I was like explaining something.
[29:48.86]God damn it.
[29:49.52]Oh well.
[29:51.13]Um.
[29:52.18]long story short is it costs a lot of money to make those projects and those are the things that I want to start to focus on and you got give me but like how long what come on I have to install the game like four times I think we understand that I just like complaining I like complaining too it's fun um no I mean that that's not um that's not the reason why that hasn't been like any videos I mean obviously I've been focusing a lot on like
[30:18.73]Twitch and trying to work on... We've been trying to get this one fucking project and I can't fucking wait to start making it.
[30:26.64]It's like... It's not like anything you've seen before.
[30:30.36]It's not like another... The one that I want to do next is like... I can't wait to start it.
[30:37.99]It's just got... It's fucking crazy.
[30:42.17]A joint co-op game.
[30:44.73]You can do an entire... You can do the whole thing co-op.
[30:46.65]Who cares?
[30:51.66]I'm not going to spoil it.
[30:53.08]I have not talked about this one.
[30:56.20]I have not spoken once about this particular project.
[30:59.30]Because I want this to be like a surprise.
[31:00.78]Because it's... It's like my baby at this point.
[31:03.14]It's my child.
[31:04.56]I cannot... You can't know what the sex of the baby is until it's born.
[31:10.56]You know, I don't want you guys to ultrasound me and see like what kind of baby I'm going to have.
[31:14.48]No.
[31:15.32]I want to be surprised.
[31:16.69]I want it to come out and be like, Look!
[31:19.41]There it is.
[31:23.40]Why do I still have the face cam on?
[31:25.36]I'm not a face cammer.
[31:34.73]Live action italic sound word.
[31:37.43]No.
[31:41.01]My name is Shane Carpenter.
[31:45.09]Turn it back on.
[31:45.95]No!
[31:46.15]I don't like it.
[31:47.02]You can see me.
[31:54.40]What?
[31:54.88]The hell does that mean?
[32:00.95]When you make things right, you don't make it right.
[32:02.91]You don't make it right.
[32:05.33]Whatever you say, man.
[32:09.26]Feeling good, buddy?
[32:10.85]You look psyched.
[32:11.59]Hell, you look so good.
[32:12.55]I wish I was you.
[32:13.45]Did so many games start like this?
[32:15.77]We're on guard at the top of the world today.
[32:18.31]There's views there that would put your imagination to shame.
[32:21.10]Come on, man.
[32:22.70]You're late.
[32:23.50]Later than, uh... I can't think of nothing, man, but we're super late.
[32:26.92]Come on.
[32:27.91]Sir, is it a good transfer?
[32:30.09]You looked pretty beat last night.
[32:32.32]We're gonna get you fixed up and ready to move, buddy.
[32:34.88]Don't you worry.
[32:35.66]Come on, buddy.
[32:36.86]Sir, buddy, we're both sergeants.
[32:38.80]This is Jerma tier writing?
[32:40.46]Hey!
[32:42.10]I'm Morgan DeVal.
[32:44.12]I don't write fucking, like, scripts for video games.
[32:47.49]What are you talking about?
[32:49.11]And we call this one Watchtrap.
[32:52.97]Why is that an Australian scout?
[32:54.25]These are just four different scouts.
[32:55.53]We got regular scout on the left.
[32:57.33]Australian scout on the right there.
[32:58.99]Bald scout in the middle.
[33:00.05]Listen to dudes being dudes.
[33:00.81]Neither do these script writers apparently.
[33:21.80]I can't skip this.
[33:22.34]Oh, I can look around at least.
[33:23.06]What's the premise of Haze?
[33:24.32]That guy just dabbed.
[33:24.96]That was terrible.
[33:25.40]That's how you jump?
[33:53.18]Already I can tell you I hate this because there's a visor in my field of view.
[33:58.49]Like I'm in a mech suit.
[34:00.55]That's so dumb.
[34:01.33]Why would you put that here?
[34:05.77]I thought that was my cursor.
[34:08.24]I'm looking over there like, why is my cursor so huge?
[34:11.76]What the fuck?
[34:12.26]And I'm like, why is it not moving?
[34:15.94]What like Nintendo 64 Mario game are we in right now?
[34:18.58]This is freaking me out.
[34:23.20]Can't wait for this to fucking kill Halo, guys.
[34:26.97]Got wood.
[34:27.71]Did you hear that?
[34:28.63]Halo's not gonna stand a chance.
[34:51.75]Yeah, it's time for the drugs to kick in, apparently.
[34:54.77]Those guys are flying way too close.
[34:58.20]I wouldn't be cheering, I'd be screaming.
[34:59.98]See, like, look!
[35:04.38]That's what happens when you fuckin' preemptively
[35:08.68]This gives her my squad?
[35:09.36]I just yawned.
[35:09.96]Oh, I just yawned.
[35:10.32]Come on, not yet.
[35:11.06]Board your squad's dropship.
[35:12.42]Which one is that?
[35:13.36]This one?
[35:38.45]I don't know.
[35:38.77]Oh, it's the one... I know which one it is.
[35:40.69]It's the one where all the default guys have their masks off.
[35:44.47]The only player models that have actual faces.
[35:47.17]You crazy son of a bitch!
[35:49.47]He's trying to get us all killed!
[35:51.17]I'm fine.
[35:52.91]Morgan, I think he's okay.
[35:55.07]You're okay, right?
[35:57.36]Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
[35:58.78]Yeah, I'm fine.
[36:01.66]You're not on this dropship and you're not on this mission.
[36:04.46]Go park your ass in your bunk.
[36:07.30]These guys are all gonna die.
[36:18.35]They're trying to make us care about these guys.
[36:23.09]One of them's gonna die and it's gonna be a big, huge problem.
[36:27.67]You don't have five people in a squad in a video game.
[36:30.11]It's always four.
[36:32.05]It's always four guys.
[36:34.39]Make their way through the game.
[36:38.06]This four-player co-op was a thing.
[36:39.88]There was a fifth guy there.
[36:42.30]Watch, this guy's gonna get sucked out.
[36:49.54]That's a- don't drink- don't drink the fucking olive oil.
[36:51.62]What are you doing?
[36:55.26]There's no beer, right?
[36:57.40]They're drinking- they're drinking EVOO out of a fucking bottle.
[37:01.12]Okay.
[37:06.93]The guy's face on the right.
[37:08.02]Alright, that was literally drugs.
[37:14.02]The haze is just guys drink olive oil laced drugs.
[37:17.58]And turn into sickos.
[37:21.70]Hear that curled up clown face?
[37:28.49]Oh man, this is pretty good.
[37:31.33]Where's this from?
[37:31.83]Imported from Italy?
[37:33.41]Hell yeah, man.
[37:36.35]High five!
[37:37.59]Boom.
[37:38.85]Missile on the right.
[37:40.01]That guy gets sucked out.
[37:41.93]Guy on the right barely gets sucked out.
[37:44.27]And me and this guy on the right are the only two.
[37:46.75]The guy holding on top of the Japanese subway is gone.
[37:49.88]You know what I mean?
[37:51.24]He's out.
[37:52.40]Is this just like a jokey thing where like four guys get drunk and go on a fake adventure?
[38:15.31]I feel like this is one of those, like, Westworld-type scenarios where that bunch of rich guys pay and pretend to be in, like, a sci-fi shooter.
[38:22.15]Is that what this is?
[38:24.37]Maybe we're, like, just drinking, laughing, like, holding up.
[38:30.80]Like, what?
[38:31.54]This is not even real.
[38:33.10]It's not real.
[38:36.16]These aren't real bullets.
[38:48.73]Use the Nectar.
[38:50.51]Nectar is a revolutionary bio-enhancing medication developed by Mantor Global Industries to help you fight smarter, faster, and stronger.
[38:58.51]It is, it's just drugs.
[38:59.55]That's what the game's called, Haze.
[39:02.05]The bar to your left is your Nectar gauge.
[39:03.75]This indicates the amount of Nectar in your bloodstream.
[39:06.23]I can't believe it, it actually is.
[39:08.39]To administer a dose of Nectar, press and hold L2.
[39:10.21]Wow.
[39:16.29]You can carry up to six doses of nectar.
[39:17.87]These will replenish over time.
[39:20.05]Please enjoy your stay in Westworld, you drunk asshole.
[39:27.01]Don't overfill the gauge.
[39:29.93]What the fuck are these guys?
[39:41.72]Fight a bunch of human torches.
[39:46.70]What is this?
[39:47.10]What am I doing?
[39:54.68]Oh, it's a grenade.
[39:55.44]Okay, alright, I get it.
[39:58.90]What kind of grenade is this?
[40:00.00]This looks like a fucking Norelco shaving kit.
[40:04.27]Oh my god.
[40:08.55]How do I zoom in?
[40:09.35]This is like a drug.
[40:12.63]What a fun fucking camping drug this is.
[40:18.51]Did you know that nectar makes you stronger?
[40:20.41]I have no bullets.
[40:30.64]I think I exploded.
[40:31.66]I think I took too many drugs.
[40:43.81]I took too many bugs.
[40:44.63]I turned into a balloon.
[40:48.56]Alright, alright, let's go.
[40:49.33]I understand it now.
[41:00.52]I don't.
[41:04.32]Wait, why were these- weren't these guys all just on fire?
[41:08.52]What happened there?
[41:12.71]Oh, I- it makes me- I get all fucked up on drugs.
[41:24.87]I missed dead to rights.
[41:27.33]See?
[41:27.49]Ay yi yi.
[41:36.18]Alright, can we go?
[41:42.06]I guess we're just gonna keep going.
[41:43.10]Collect a what?
[41:50.28]Ugh.
[41:52.32]You really have to play two throw-up-inducing games back-to-back.
[42:00.02]Oh, man.
[42:00.71]This is actually really bothering me.
[42:01.93]I understand... I understand that the...
[42:18.45]Interesting idea, like you do a bunch of drugs and shoot guys and stuff.
[42:21.91]I mean, that's not really that interesting.
[42:26.84]I would rather not have... Okay, the drugs is to make it so you can see where people are hiding.
[42:35.44]And the air is breathable.
[42:45.38]Told you long ago when you played a YouTuber's life to get some self-respect.
[42:49.00]I guess you haven't.
[42:51.51]What was that?
[42:52.31]Was that just like a gremlin?
[42:53.45]What was that little gremlin?
[42:55.81]It was like a little snake-headed gremlin.
[42:57.57]What was that?
[42:58.71]Was that a leaf?
[42:59.87]I was like looking at the other screen and out of the corner of my eye I just saw like a fucking leaf fly by.
[43:04.81]What the hell was that?
[43:07.54]I'm like over here reading chat and I just see like something fly into the screen.
[43:14.99]things a whole lot easier with a dose of nectar in your blood.
[43:18.54]Hit yourself up, buddy.
[43:20.10]Alright.
[43:21.22]Do the throats, baby.
[43:26.54]I took too many.
[43:28.02]I took too many drugs.
[43:31.43]Bloodstream is abnormal.
[43:36.31]It's just doing random buttons.
[43:44.16]Um.
[43:46.02]It's alright, just take him again and be fine.
[43:51.58]This is nauseating.
[43:52.54]I know.
[43:53.42]I'm sorry.
[43:55.09]This is the end.
[43:57.03]I don't get anything else.
[43:57.93]The other games that I have for PS3 are, like, good.
[44:01.07]No, that's not true.
[44:05.33]I don't want to do this anymore.
[44:16.48]I'm getting there.
[44:17.68]You think the pilot can hold out long enough for us to get to the crash site?
[44:20.46]I don't have any more drugs left.
[44:21.74]What do I do?
[44:22.20]I'd be more worried about the cargo.
[44:24.28]Either way, we need to speed this up.
[44:27.71]Copy that.
[44:28.33]If we're all on drugs, that means I'm going to do something weird, right?
[44:31.71]Like, the guy that's on the most drugs does the throw grenade at a teammate, right?
[44:38.90]Oh, brother, you are seriously going to make my shit list.
[44:49.82]Whoa, they're shooting me.
[44:52.11]They actually shoot back at you.
[45:07.47]The mission's still going.
[45:14.82]Where'd you learn to shoot, ass beast?
[45:22.44]Sherman's dead.
[45:23.04]No, that triggered the attack.
[45:28.81]Just like in a real game of Counter-Strike.
[45:37.22]Ass feet.
[45:40.12]What the hell are you doing?
[45:41.16]Ass feet.
[45:49.38]Sucks.
[45:50.02]It does.
[45:51.00]We have to try to get rid of everybody.
[45:52.20]Wait, what did I say?
[45:53.64]Transfer nectar from- Okay, I'm gonna take all their drugs.
[45:55.56]I can take all their drugs.
[45:56.84]Okay, I took all his drugs.
[45:57.80]Now what about his?
[45:58.46]Okay.
[46:18.52]Wait, is that guy?
[46:20.10]That guy's gas tank is falling off.
[46:23.84]Alright, Sherman's done.
[46:25.76]Who's left?
[46:27.92]Okay, Sherman is gone.
[46:30.28]Jacob, whatever his name is.
[46:31.64]Alright, this is the last guy.
[46:33.48]Why don't you try sniping on Nectar?
[46:38.06]It's totally crazy, man!
[46:49.31]can't fail those guys are just here for the first five minutes of the game apparently alright I gotta get out of this before I physically die like I'm going to I'm gonna die playing this game
[47:04.60]Maybe all of the news, like, oh, this just in, 930 News, welcome to the local 930 News.
[47:11.49]Streamer plays this new game that just came out.
[47:15.67]Obviously, because the reporter's not going to know, right?
[47:17.87]What the fuck does a reporter know about this shit?
[47:20.33]This new game came out that's causing people to die.
[47:23.53]That's right, we're talking about Haze for the PlayStation.
[47:27.75]He's not going to say PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3.
[47:29.26]He's going to say PlayStation.
[47:33.43]Jeremy Elbertson, 36-year-old male... What was that?
[47:41.27]Jeremy Elbertson, 36-year-old male, was streaming the game for four hours straight.
[47:47.98]And he died.
[47:51.02]It took the loved one seven weeks to find him.
[47:56.25]And when they found him, he was a fucking skeleton.
[47:59.93]An actual skeleton.
[48:08.24]Was I just having an interaction with the characters that aren't here anymore?
[48:14.20]What's up, buddy?
[48:15.46]You guys okay?
[48:16.66]We're fine.
[48:19.08]You sure?
[48:19.92]Yeah.
[48:21.12]Why?
[48:22.06]That screaming.
[48:23.24]You sure?
[48:23.65]Because I killed you like five seconds ago.
[48:25.97]Like less than five minutes ago.
[48:27.13]Just an animal.
[48:28.11]You sure about that?
[48:29.23]How far are we from the site?
[48:32.37]Not far.
[48:33.37]Push up.
[48:34.29]We'll see you there.
[48:36.33]That was perfect.
[48:36.71]Then we can get some chow.
[48:38.83]You sure, man?
[48:41.21]Are you fucking really sure?
[48:45.66]Different guy.
[48:46.38]What up, Sarge?
[48:51.91]I got your back.
[49:12.23]What?
[49:16.45]That guy died in two hits.
[49:19.73]What is he doing?
[49:21.73]He's lost control.
[49:23.21]Hey, you sure?
[49:31.18]Yeah.
[49:32.68]I think I'm sure.
[49:45.66]Die, die, die.
[49:47.36]Is this teammates shooting me or did I piss off the whole server?
[49:55.89]Get the fuck, come on.
[50:08.71]I'm... I'm... We're done.
[50:12.53]This is it.
[50:14.31]My last... My last go here.
[50:17.10]Before I get out.
[50:17.76]Because this... This beginning level is the worst beginning level you could have ever made.
[50:23.12]Put me anywhere else.
[50:25.42]There's so many people here.
[50:26.54]Alright.
[50:32.40]That's it.
[50:33.10]Goodbye.
[50:34.00]Goodbye, game.
[50:36.12]It's your last chance to show me something.
[50:42.36]Anything in here?
[50:42.96]No, I'm just gonna die.
[50:48.15]Alright, that's it.
[50:52.89]There are cars and flamethrowers next.
[50:55.15]Don't... What?
[50:59.06]Wait a minute, did you... Are you serious?
[51:00.74]I can drive a car?
[51:07.06]We might have to stay here then.
[51:09.84]Do I get to drive the car?
[51:19.13]I'm gonna drive the car.
[51:22.41]Cause that might, that might take me into the spot.
[51:27.63]No.
[51:29.85]No, you, uh, I'm just...
[51:48.85]Uh, hold on.
[51:56.83]Shit.
[51:58.73]Wait, wait, wait.
[51:59.35]Shit.
[52:20.48]Alright, fixed the problem.
[52:25.06]Ah, it made it even worse!
[52:26.46]Alright, please tell me when he bleeds out and I get the control of the screen back.
[52:41.96]Oh!
[52:45.05]Die!
[52:46.53]Oh my god, do I have to seriously go back there and make you end?
[52:50.47]End him!
[52:53.55]That's enough!
[52:56.53]How long do you have to do this?
[53:03.98]Wait, he's dead, he's dead.
[53:09.30]It just gives me... Give me a break.
[53:13.80]It gives me a fucking cinematic angle.
[53:19.40]Oh, for the love of God.
[53:20.42]I just threw a grenade.
[53:30.05]Well, now we have to stay here for a minute.
[53:32.86]It might actually help me.
[53:33.70]I might be able to screen cheat and know where the fuck I'm going.
[53:44.78]Okay, guy behind me!
[53:45.48]Guy behind!
[53:51.78]I can't tell.
[53:52.44]I can at least watch my back.
[54:05.27]I need to get to the car.
[54:07.29]Unless I was being lied to.
[54:12.31]Okay, I might have been getting lied to.
[54:14.93]Can I, like, do anything?
[54:16.05]No, I can't do anything.
[54:18.48]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[54:20.44]Cut the shit.
[54:21.74]I gotta speedrun this.
[54:35.63]Is there a sprint?
[54:42.79]Who's behind me?
[54:43.21]Some- God damn it, somebody's behind me!
[54:50.78]The car is over an hour away, are you shitting me?
[54:55.16]Oh fuck, I can't tell where they're shooting from.
[54:57.62]Okay, alright, I've had enough.
[55:08.57]Goodbye, that's the end.
[55:16.91]What am I supposed to do over here?
[55:21.90]I got at least a B on everybody.
[55:31.60]I'm dead.
[55:31.96]Like... I have to stop it.
[55:35.01]It's over.
[55:37.81]Alright, guys.
[55:39.73]That's gonna do it for tonight.
[55:42.23]I'm hungry.
[55:43.01]I'm tired.
[55:43.87]My throat hurts.
[55:48.71]The last thing we're going to do is we're going to open this up and just see what's here.
[55:56.03]Too bad.
[55:59.62]PlayStation 3, we got David Souls, Tokyo Juggle, and Kung Fu Live, which I don't have set up.
[56:07.38]Tomorrow, I'm going to be live tomorrow because I'm not going to be able to do anything on Thursday or Friday.
[56:13.75]I got to go take some emergency.
[56:15.39]That's right.
[56:17.49]Playing Metal Gear Solid?
[56:18.59]No, not tonight.
[56:19.37]That's an investment.
[56:23.62]We're going to start.
[56:24.86]We're going to try.
[56:26.56]Oh man, listen to me.
[56:28.08]I'm so sorry.
[56:30.28]We're going to try to play Elix tomorrow night.
[56:33.59]E-L-E-X.
[56:37.35]It looks like it has a lot of potential.
[56:42.22]So same time, 7 o'clock, probably like 6, maybe 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, maybe.
[56:49.65]I'm going to try to actually start earlier tomorrow.
[56:54.79]Sorry, I just made like a thousand people yawn.
[56:57.49]I'm sorry about that.
[56:59.69]So we'll play Elex tomorrow night.
[57:01.94]And then if you're going to TwitchCon, come say hello.
[57:05.12]Come track me down somewhere.
[57:06.88]I'll be around every day on the convention floor.
[57:10.80]And we'll have a chat.
[57:13.40]So good night, everybody.
[57:14.22]Let me just say a thank you to Pika.
[57:18.16]Thank you, Pika Flare, for the three bucks.
[57:19.48]Fun fact, Haze was made by the same people who made TimeSplitters.
[57:24.74]I remember TimeSplitters being a fairly fun game, but that's interesting.
[57:29.92]Thank you, Pika.
[57:31.84]Tara, thank you, Tara, for the two bucks.
[57:33.75]Speaking of Jerma tier writing, I seem to remember you telling us that you would release the unfinished remains of your game book sometime.

[57:41.51]It did not.
[57:44.37]I have to go into the ankle writer.
[57:47.07]I hope it still exists.
[57:50.64]Actually, I'll do that after the stream tonight.
[57:52.32]Fuck, listen to this.
[57:54.92]Listen to this.
[57:55.70]That's like four yawns in four seconds.
