[00:00.07]Get it good, let's go, let's get it good, let's go, get it good, get it good, get it going, get it going good.
[00:04.62]This level looks amazing.
[00:06.20]This looks like if you wanted to play Battlefield, but couldn't afford any monies.
[00:11.86]I'm driving the VIP.
[00:13.32]This game is so, like, ugh.
[00:16.26]It's so glitchy, like, I can't even tell what's going on at any given moment.
[00:20.79]Ugh, just leaning out of a car is, like, just as bad.
[00:23.97]Just, like, two, like, three guys in this car driving around a metropolis with, like, terrorist towels wrapped around their head.
[00:32.27]I guess they want everyone to know that there's no sand blowing in their face.
[00:37.22]You have an RPG.
[00:38.50]What?
[00:39.02]What?
[00:39.88]What?
[00:41.58]That's what you do with it?
[00:43.68]Until you have one and you just instantly shoot it.
[00:46.21]Dude, blow up this car with the dude in it.
[00:48.51]No.
[00:49.55]I'm gonna get a guy.
[00:55.71]No!
[00:57.02]Are you serious?
[01:03.16]No!
[01:04.58]Escort the VIP.
[01:08.37]Okay, no.
[01:09.07]This is how you drive.
[01:09.81]Hold the crouch while you drive.
[01:11.21]No, that's terrible.
[01:18.89]No one will ever hurt me.
[01:20.08]Okay, let's actually play this round, okay?
[01:23.68]Yes.
[01:24.59]Let's turn right.
[01:25.35]Just keep going.
[01:25.91]Just keep going.
[01:26.51]I am.
[01:26.93]I'm doing well.
[01:27.59]We're going to meet them at the VIP.
[01:29.89]Like, they're going to drive all the way down here.
[01:31.26]We're going to set up a roadblock.
[01:32.30]You know what I mean?
[01:33.06]Like, this corner.
[01:33.86]Like, no, no, no, no.
[01:34.78]Wait, you mean like right here?
[01:37.16]Where are you talking?
[01:38.26]Turn left.
[01:39.50]We're going to do this.
[01:40.34]Turn right.
[01:41.40]I'm looking at the GPS.
[01:43.90]This intersection right here.
[01:45.22]We're going to set up.
[01:45.84]Yes.
[01:46.78]Like, turn the car so we can get behind it.
[01:48.06]I wish the brakes of this car would work.
[01:49.50]No, turn the car so we can get behind it.
[01:52.16]They're coming.
[01:52.57]They're coming.
[01:52.97]Get out quick.
[01:54.65]Alright, let's get behind the car.
[01:58.67]Ah, this is probably... Can we do it?
[02:00.15]I got him!
[02:00.55]Got him!
[02:03.29]Why is he... I think we actually did something.
[02:08.63]Get the briefcase!
[02:09.23]What do we do with the briefcase?
[02:10.31]What do we do?
[02:10.73]What do we do?
[02:11.03]Grab the rope?
[02:12.19]Oh, it's a guy in the helicopter!
[02:13.25]A guy in the helicopter!
[02:13.87]You have to grab the rope!
[02:15.14]Grab it!
[02:15.86]Helicopters.
[02:16.68]Helicopters.
[02:17.48]Helicopters.
[02:18.28]Helicopters.
[02:19.02]Wow!
[02:20.36]We tried for one round.
[02:22.64]Helicopters.
[02:24.17]Okay, this guy's just driving.
[02:25.37]He didn't even hit him that hard.
[02:33.40]He got, he made it out alive.
[02:34.84]No, no, he's going to make it.
[02:35.83]He's going to do it.
[02:39.07]That looked really tactical.
[02:41.19]That was so stupid.
[02:43.59]Oh, God.
[02:50.19]I'm done I'm trying What is happening, I don't know what is happening Come on, you want to go you want to go?
[03:12.52]You want a knife fight me?
[03:13.28]Yeah
[03:19.55]We're just gonna get shot any second.
[03:22.31]No, no, screw this.
[03:23.61]Okay, Jerma, it is your sole duty in life to protect me.
[03:26.83]I'm the VIP.
[03:27.87]So I... Alright, you've got it.
[03:29.60]And I'm gonna defend myself with my arms.
[03:32.04]Let's go this way.
[03:32.72]I don't know what's this way.
[03:33.62]Alright, I will protect you at all costs.
[03:37.72]I'll make sure that you stay alive.
[03:40.48]Okay, I'm gonna actually use my gun, maybe.
[03:42.56]I feel like we should kill them.
[03:44.62]I've been tasked with defending you, and I'm gonna do that.
[03:50.25]Alright, do it.
[03:52.15]I heard some firing.
[03:53.05]Okay, let's go.
[03:54.97]Let's go.
[03:55.29]Let's go.
[03:55.67]Let's go.
[03:56.05]Let's grow.
[03:56.51]Let's grow.
[03:57.03]Let's grow.
[03:57.77]Watch your back here.
[04:00.27]Watch out behind you.
[04:02.56]Behind you.
[04:04.08]What are they doing?
[04:06.22]We're going to win.
[04:08.74]No.
[04:09.22]Oh, my God.
[04:10.80]What is extreme content?
[04:13.68]What does that mean?
[04:16.80]This is so hard to do this.
[04:17.98]No, we're going to win.
[04:19.08]Alright, we got one.
[04:20.06]I don't have any ammo left.
[04:25.86]I'm coming to help you.
[04:26.44]I'm coming to help you.
[04:32.45]Oh, shit.
[04:32.99]They're waiting.
[04:33.61]Why would they just wait there?
[04:36.45]I hit them one time for 10 damage.
[04:39.35]I felt like I did more than that.
[04:43.19]I don't even know what you look like.
[04:45.49]You wanna come get me?
[04:46.47]Come on.
[04:47.87]Oh shit!
[04:50.31]I can't see!
[04:51.63]Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, up!
[04:52.85]Ready!
[04:53.09]I think like half our team left, like let's try this time.
[04:55.69]No, me and you are gonna hide somewhere.
[04:57.04]What do you mean we're gonna hide somewhere?
[04:59.00]We're gonna hide somewhere that they'll never expect us.
[05:02.40]But they probably know this map and actually play it because they're Koopa Shell ranked.
[05:06.32]Here, let's just wait, um...
[05:09.68]This seems really obscure.
[05:10.92]Why would anyone be up here?
[05:11.96]Let's just wait up here.
[05:13.04]No, we can't, like, go in the building or anything?
[05:17.15]No, we can't even go behind this tree, because you'd be stuck forever.
[05:19.91]There's stuff down there.
[05:21.41]There's a guy.
[05:21.89]There's a guy.
[05:22.39]There's two guys.
[05:25.59]Okay, well.
[05:28.29]What?
[05:29.55]Good job.
[05:30.29]Oh, wait, that was the VIP.
[05:31.91]I'm the MVP again.
[05:34.37]I just jumped around the corner and just got the VIP.
[05:37.54]That's it.
[05:38.30]That's all you had to do?
[05:39.30]That's all you had to do.
[05:40.40]Okay.
[05:40.52]Alright.
[05:41.80]That's a lot easier than getting in a car.
[05:44.12]Okay, I'm going to do the driving.
[05:45.54]Hi, look at you.
[05:46.30]I'm just going to drive this car around.
[05:48.04]This is a good idea.
[05:49.78]Hey, what turn?
[05:51.04]Do we go this way to go to Disney World?
[05:53.80]Yeah, man.
[05:58.49]Oh, sweet.
[05:59.67]This is so much better than Counter-Strike.
[06:01.43]VIP's in the back of your car with a bloody face like he got ran over.
[06:06.06]Oh, I'm taking him.
[06:09.56]I'm taking him.
[06:10.76]This is the worst.
