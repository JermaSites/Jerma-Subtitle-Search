[00:01.72]I guess Kimmel didn't do much for him.
[00:10.25]Will you guys stop saying the words Jimmy and Kimmel right next to each other?
[00:13.95]What do you mean?
[00:20.44]Of course somebody said it.
[00:21.52]I just read it.
[00:24.40]All he uses is Reddit.
[00:25.28]Give me one sec.
[01:04.67]Sorry, I just had to tweet about it.
[01:07.44]Guys, I get like... I get like 200 plus people instantly from Twitter.
[01:13.80]I have to tweet it.
[01:16.36]Sometimes 400.
[01:16.76]Why are you laughing?
[01:26.95]I guess I'm laughing too.
[01:28.13]We're both laughing.
[01:31.77]What are we doing today?
[01:32.75]A couple of things.
[01:35.37]Continuing our just grab bag week.
[01:38.27]Just pulling games out of a hat.
[01:39.83]Because we got a whole plan.
[01:43.25]Next week and the week after that.
[01:46.71]Joby Bunny is tomorrow.
[01:49.19]If you are wondering.
[01:52.60]As well as Hivemind.
[01:55.02]Which is something I've been looking forward to playing for a pretty long time actually.
[01:58.36]Hivemind is a game that was made by somebody in the community.
[02:03.97]It is a family feud game.
[02:06.71]That we can play.
[02:08.90]Where I have to essentially kind of guess what you think.
[02:12.48]What I think your answers are going to be.
[02:16.84]He's been working on it for a while.
[02:18.02]We're probably going to do it tomorrow.
[02:20.53]And Chubby Bunny's tomorrow too.
[02:21.73]Remember when you promised Chubby Bunny?
[02:28.61]I just gave you a date.
[02:29.69]I just gave you a hard date.
[02:30.77]It's tomorrow.
[02:34.16]Am I gonna revisit Phasmophobia?
[02:36.72]Um, I don't know.
[02:38.82]Maybe.
[02:41.04]I think the right amount of lightning needs to strike for four people to be ready in VR to play that game.
[02:48.45]And I was the guy that didn't have VR.
[02:54.57]You said that you would eat an egg.
[02:56.09]What egg?
[03:02.11]We doing face cam today?
[03:03.21]No, face cam tomorrow.
[03:08.85]Fix your VR.
[03:11.03]Should we tell him?
[03:12.33]Should we tell him that I streamed VR for like two weeks?
[03:15.84]Don't tell that person that I already streamed VR for like two weeks.
[03:22.92]Alright, let me clear my throat off.
[03:32.56]I said, why is there a slug emote?
[03:34.72]Um, I just, I added jermaSlug pog and everyone is really mad at me.
[03:40.24]But now I'm in that weird, awful place where half of the people that use that emote, that think it's really funny, they love that shit.
[03:47.99]But then the other half of you that almost throw up in your mouth when you see it and that you want to delete it from the internet, now I got half of you that say that too.
[03:55.31]So now I've got to deal with both of the sides here that are like, we want slug pog, we don't want slug pog.
[04:03.62]Then at that point, it comes down to what I want, right?
[04:06.28]And here's what I want.
[04:09.48]Chaos.
[04:12.13]So it's working perfectly.
[04:13.45]Alright, let's play.
[04:15.55]We're gonna play a couple of games.
[04:20.63]Oh my god, what's going on today?
[04:21.76]Oh, what the fuck?
[04:33.00]Okay.
[04:35.31]What's happening?
[04:36.03]I can't get it out.
[04:40.21]I can't stop it.
[04:41.41]Is it gone?
[04:41.89]Okay, it's gone.
[04:43.76]I don't smoke.
[04:45.90]I'm dry of water.
[04:47.04]I swear to God.
[04:47.92]I'm just fucking over 30.
[04:49.44]How come 35 is the new 60?
[04:51.76]This is bullshit.
[04:56.31]Anyways, we're going to start with Streamer Life Simulator.
[04:59.02]Before you freak out, before you throw a rock at me, just hold on.
[05:04.42]Listen, I'm not going to play this all day.
[05:08.22]I'm going to play Exanima.
[05:10.53]Exanima, right?
[05:11.63]Yeah.
[05:12.37]Exanima is a physics-based top-down dungeon crawler.
[05:15.47]I made a video on this fucking game like seven years ago.
[05:21.94]And I was told, it was recommended to me again, they said, hey dude, so much shit has been added to this game and it's way different and way better than when you played it before.
[05:30.41]It was a little wonky before, it was in like alpha or something.
[05:34.19]Play it now, please, you'll love it.
[05:36.52]So I'm like, alright man.
[05:38.74]I guess the actual 1.0 came out and they updated it a bunch of times, so I'm gonna give it a try.
[05:44.26]We'll try it again today.
[05:46.51]But that is, uh,
[05:48.90]That is before.
[05:50.92]That is after we're going to play Streamer Life Simulator.
[05:58.43]This was also recommended too.
[06:00.19]And if you don't think I pull from the recommended channel on the Discord, then where are these two games coming from?
[06:09.97]The only reason why I want to play this, one reason, there's only one single solitary reason.
[06:15.42]because you play a game in the game to a fake audience and like that I don't know why that's funny to me I like is this a cringe game I don't know what that means what does that even mean I don't even know what that means look I already have my settings ready we make a character alright let's put clothes on this person first of all
[06:48.57]porn game?
[06:52.61]It's perfect.
[06:59.13]It is not perfect.
[07:01.51]Is this just the character?
[07:02.39]Do I even care?
[07:03.59]I'm being honest.
[07:05.37]Hold on.
[07:05.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[07:06.43]There's facial morphing.
[07:10.41]Low cheek position?
[07:11.46]What is this doing?
[07:12.28]Oh, hold on.
[07:12.74]This face morphing.
[07:18.78]What's with the camera?
[07:20.70]The camera's freaking me out, man.
[07:28.05]Okay, that's a little much, but whatever.

[07:38.42]Hey, what do you mean?
[07:40.38]This is me.
[07:42.86]Ear position?

[64:22.90]We're going to be a Dark Souls, Fall Guys, and Rocket League streamer.
[64:35.56]And we're going to pre-order the $120 Cyberpunk 2077 Keanu Reeves figurine box that has the 10 computer action figures in it and the art book.
[64:49.79]And it weighs 42 pounds.

[65:41.96]Don't let him come back.
[65:42.62]Oh, scan for viruses.
[65:51.50]I got hacked, remember?
[65:54.84]Like, just scan them all.
[65:59.60]I did go to Zornhub a few times, so I wouldn't be... Oh.
[66:07.60]Uh-oh.
[66:09.98]Uh-oh.
[66:14.11]The funniest part when you run this on somebody's computer that doesn't know anything about computers is this looks like this, and then it jumps up to like 400 or 500 in 10 seconds.
[66:27.20]Doesn't look that bad until it gets halfway through.
[66:34.48]These are also people that have probably never cleared their cache, their temporary files, their browser history, ever.
[66:44.39]You can literally, unlike your grandmother's computer, you can probably see her website and her history that she went to, like in 2013.
[66:50.91]What about the other five viruses?
[66:58.19]What's this bullshit?
[66:59.57]Scan it again.
[67:00.13]Do it again.
[67:09.87]If you're not fully clean, then what's the point?
[67:13.67]They're just gonna multiply and you're gonna get more viruses.
[67:19.36]You gotta pay for those.
[67:20.22]You do?
[67:20.50]This computer is cleaner than you are.
[67:33.84]For now.
[67:43.81]For you.
[67:46.00]So what happened?
[67:46.54]They just went away?
[67:47.16]Oh, a five gigabyte hard drive.
[67:50.06]That's pretty pathetic.
[67:52.63]What year is it?
[67:53.25]Alright, spottery.
[67:58.25]Uh... Is it just songs?
[68:19.09]Okay, well it's just on there.
[68:20.99]Wallpaper!
[68:23.24]Oh yes, like I'm on the moon.
[68:30.82]Cool, alright, I like that one.
[68:41.02]Here's your mining stream key.
[68:44.49]Alright, shut this off.

[69:11.22]They didn't even start.
[69:12.42]Download...
[69:15.17]On C. I got 50 gigs.
[69:20.10]I want Fall Guys and Dark Souls first.
[69:23.40]Cyber Prank 2066.
[69:26.16]That's a huge game.
[69:27.52]I need a full hard drive to put this on.
[69:34.15]We're going to start with Dark Souls and Fall Games.
[69:38.87]I got 200 bucks.
[69:40.55]Let those download while I use the bathroom and eat some beans.
[69:45.39]I need to go to sleep.
[69:49.12]Alright, those downloads will be ready when I wake up.
[69:59.22]Nightmares?

[70:18.38]Okay.
[70:19.14]How do I get faster internet?
[70:20.96]Internet speed.
[70:22.06]If you're tired of late loading of pages of poor quality streaming, buy a new internet package.
[70:26.12]There's a website where you can buy an internet package.
[70:27.76]You can also buy in daily turbo packs.
[70:29.80]I need to take a shower.
[70:39.71]I haven't taken a shower in three days.
[70:44.88]Okay.
[70:47.85]Where's that app?
[70:48.33]What's it called?
[70:49.61]Amazon.
[70:50.09]Can you buy a shower on Amazon?
[70:53.99]You can't, right?
[70:56.35]You can't buy appliances like this.
[71:02.54]I can buy a full shower on Amazon.
[71:07.22]I don't have enough money to do this.
[71:12.26]Fridge.
[71:14.31]I don't have enough money for a bathtub.
[71:21.57]What about a shower?

[71:56.09]I'm gonna have to be dirty for a little while.
[71:57.47]I can't clean myself.
[71:59.75]Go shower in the neighbor's house.
[72:00.97]That's actually not a bad idea.
[72:06.32]Look, I'll bring some... I'll bring an offering.
[72:21.96]Can I, like, spray myself with the washer fluid?
[72:23.88]I feel so dirty.
[72:30.22]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[72:32.34]Okay, this is, this is like a rust.
[72:41.55]That's not even, these are, this is rust.
[72:43.33]This is, this is, I'm playing on a rust server.
[72:58.95]You have a bathroom?
[73:05.86]You smell disgusting.
[73:06.96]Get out of the shop.

[73:16.16]Is this his car?
[73:21.07]I want to...
[73:26.71]I'm not disgusting.
[73:27.85]You're disgusting.
[73:28.61]What are you talking about?
[73:30.23]Bite with my canine into the top of the can and like cartoon around to get the lid off and then reach in with my bare hand and eat it with the other one.
[73:39.07]Can I play?
[73:44.57]I need some money.
[73:48.40]Almond Jerry, yeah.
[73:49.06]Okay, are these done?
[73:54.72]This is just what it felt like.
[73:56.33]Some of you guys don't know.
[73:58.11]But this is what it used to be like.
[74:00.73]Back in like the mid-90s.

[80:08.23]Hold on a minute.
[80:11.50]Spiky hairstyle.

[80:34.13]My favorite class was art.
[80:36.77]And my sport was baseball.

[83:37.47]Give him the stream key.
[83:38.79]I can't believe I had to actually have the win.
[83:40.37]I slept two days in a row for this shit.
[83:50.15]It was me.
[83:50.97]It could be anybody, because I don't know.
[83:57.81]Can you get off the PC while leaving the window open?
[84:02.54]Uh, hold on.
[84:03.72]I'm about to get Dark Souls.

[85:08.56]And then you go, what is this?
[85:10.14]Oh, no.
[85:10.80]What did I download?

[139:40.27]Wait, can I like say this never showed up?
[139:42.37]Can I just like do fraud and say like, hey, these 16 pigs didn't show up.
[139:47.71]I want a refund.
[139:49.17]Okay.
[139:50.69]I'll go back.
[139:51.07]I need some food.
[140:00.64]I have a hundred bucks so I can do some high quality food.
[140:07.65]Being 100% with you, I made that do-do-do sound and I uploaded it in 2015.
[140:11.93]I mean, what do you mean?
[140:16.69]Okay, burrito, clam soup.
[140:18.47]I need something way better than that.
[140:22.20]I need like a seven star meal.
[140:24.76]By the way, seven stars.
[140:28.62]What kind of rating system is that?
[140:31.26]Seven?
[140:32.26]Out of seven.
[140:32.82]Alright, we're just going to get this thing up here.
[140:38.41]Burritos are probably the best.
[140:39.79]I'm gonna get two burritos.
[140:47.50]Dog f- Fuck, the dog food is six stars?
[140:53.54]Oh, I should set an alarm.
[140:56.38]Okay, I'm gonna set an alarm for... Um...
[141:08.21]Ten.
[141:11.43]So we don't sleep through work.
[141:13.89]Okay, that's my food.
[141:17.32]Get it.
[141:17.52]Goo Goo Gaga.
[141:20.76]Oh shit, I'm starving.
[141:22.64]Thanks for the burritos.
[141:23.30]Alright, we're good.
[141:26.71]I need to use the toilet.
[141:28.13]I gotta pay this guy to pee.
[141:38.00]Just get rich as fuck.
[141:39.54]What do you think I'm doing?
[141:40.33]I'm trying.
[141:44.27]Just pee down the drain.
[141:48.54]I'll sleep and I'll pee somewhere in the morning.
[141:56.49]What's up with- hold on, let me read this.
[141:58.43]What's up with Jerma today?
[142:00.19]He started streaming today.
[142:01.03]It was marked as Dark Souls, but he was just playing impossible game.
[142:03.61]Chat was incredibly slow.
[142:04.69]Most of the people called him obese and advertised their own channel for some reason.
[142:07.87]No mods.
[142:08.92]But the worst fucking thing is that I donated and asked him to say hello to my loved one and he just insulted my mother.
[142:14.18]Anyone knows what's going on with him lately?
[142:18.90]Um.
[142:21.10]Quite a lot, as you can see.
[142:26.51]Omega LOL.
[142:27.85]Oh my god.
[142:28.41]Omega LOL real.
[142:29.25]Alright, send money to the card.
[142:32.33]Wait, I need money in my wallet.
[142:33.35]I don't have any money in my wallet.
[142:37.83]I can't pee.
[142:38.73]I can just shit at work.
[142:39.41]I can just pee at work.
[142:43.95]I was going to the bathroom at work.
[142:45.29]It's fine.
[142:46.21]Alright, I need gas.
[142:52.99]I have to pay for that service.
[142:59.46]How much is it?
[143:01.26]I'll take an Uber.
[143:05.92]Set the destination where you want to go.
[143:07.26]I can't take an Uber to work?
[143:15.19]I can't walk to work?
[143:17.57]I know.
[143:18.07]I gotta go.
[143:19.99]Stop.
[143:20.35]I know I have to work.
[143:21.35]Leave me alone.
[143:26.57]Job king.
[143:27.13]Your waiter job starts.

[143:31.67]Take the bus?
[143:32.95]Can you?
[143:34.67]Wait, can I take taxi?
[143:37.79]Walk, dude.
[143:56.72]I gotta ditch work and stream.

[146:21.29]What language do you speak?
[146:22.75]Well, I speak English.
[146:23.55]It's what I'm speaking right now.

[147:14.49]Good morning.
[147:14.89]Hey, good morning.
[147:16.97]Speak from your past.
[147:18.11]Let's talk about the future.
[147:19.03]Probably going to see Jerma Rumble live on Twitch eventually at some point in the next couple of years.
[147:26.26]What song we got going on here?
[147:27.24]Let's change the music a little.
[147:30.27]How about... I wanted to be a little chill.
[147:34.53]We'll talk about my past.
[147:35.55]One time I shit my mother's bed.
[147:37.18]I think I play a lot more talent.
[147:41.88]I think I'm more talented than you in Fortnite.
[147:43.90]That's all good, man.
[147:45.00]I don't play Fortnite that often, so... Pull that out a little.
[147:51.08]Alright guys, I'll see you guys later.
[147:53.16]That's uh, that's it.
[147:57.68]I got the same stream title.
[148:00.68]For like two months.
[148:07.23]Dude, alright.
[148:08.67]I got 60 bucks.
[148:12.55]Well, it does say aces only.
[148:14.13]I don't even have Counter-Strike installed.
[148:20.27]Okay, I don't have Counter-Strike.
[148:22.84]I'm not even playing that game.
[148:24.36]Oh, Rocket Soccer.
[148:29.90]Okay, let's uninstall Fall Guys.
[148:32.12]Fall Guys sucks.
[148:36.34]How do I uninstall Fall Guys?
[148:43.26]You must choose the disc.
[148:44.60]I want it on C, but I know it's free space.
[148:46.76]How do I get it off?
[148:47.70]Uninstall it.
[148:50.20]I can't uninstall the game.
[148:51.78]I need another hard drive.
[148:52.70]Are you kidding me?
[148:54.65]Well, I made some money, though.
[148:55.57]That's pretty good.
[148:57.25]Let's see.
[149:02.01]I got 145 bucks.
[149:03.89]That's enough for me to fill the gas with... Add gas to the car.
[149:09.19]Go to work.
[149:12.86]I'm gonna go to work today.
[149:17.28]Oh, I got two gamer points.
[149:19.55]Let's see what they do.
[149:26.13]Shit.
[149:27.23]Can I upload videos?
[149:31.26]Did I record any videos?
[149:32.92]Zootube.
[149:33.36]I could get like ad revenue.
[149:44.30]A new copy-pasta.
[149:45.97]New copy-pasta.
[149:46.75]Alright, upload.
[149:49.11]I don't have any recorded videos.
[149:50.61]I'm so tired.
[149:51.31]Alright, I get to start recording.
[149:57.89]I'm doing alright.
[149:58.99]Let's go to sleep.
[150:08.09]Okay, now I'm okay with food.
[150:12.09]I need to go to the bathroom, and I'm going to pay this guy, which is stupid to pay 10 bucks to use the bathroom, but I'm going to do it.
[150:17.34]I don't have money in my wallet.
[150:21.36]Go to my... What are you doing?
[150:26.52]Go to the ATM.
[150:27.46]Alright, well, whatever.
[150:28.44]I'll just pee.
[150:32.34]I can't wait to have thousands of dollars in my bank account.
[150:34.26]It's going to be sick.
[150:34.90]Alright, let's go.
[150:43.75]Alright, so how much... I have 25% gas.
[150:45.63]I probably should fill it up more.
[150:50.27]Where's the actual gas station around here?
[150:52.05]There's probably one in town, right?
[150:57.79]Are you gonna play this all night?
[151:01.59]I gotta be real honest with you.
[151:03.49]Probably.
[151:07.32]I was gonna play Exanima.
[151:08.74]Exanima was the backup, but... I don't think we even need a backup.
[151:13.93]I'm kind of like completely engaged right now.
[151:24.27]No, don't go back to the house.
[151:25.53]Are you dumb?
[151:26.89]Don't break the car.
[151:34.54]I just saw the mini map thing.
[151:36.16]The tooltip pop up and I was like, oh, I go that way.
[151:44.31]Xanima is actually awesome.
[151:47.01]Apparently it's changed a lot since the last time I played it.
[151:48.83]Alright, we need a real gas station here though.
[151:57.12]I hope there's one here so I don't break down again and have to pay 80 bucks to fill the tank.
[152:08.27]Internet Cafe Simulator.
[152:09.99]Was that another game that this person made?
[152:12.98]It has to be.
[152:13.52]No, I've seen that.
[152:14.14]I've seen that before.
[152:14.80]I've seen it on Steam.
[152:24.95]Okay, I need gas.
[152:26.61]Bad.
[152:27.01]Like, right now.
[152:28.89]Turn the car off.
[152:29.33]I need to go get gas before work.
[152:35.69]Where is there a gas station?
[152:36.45]Okay, gas.
[152:38.45]There's one right up here.
[152:39.23]Alright, straight ahead.
[152:49.33]I'm out of gas.
[152:49.81]I'm out of gas.
[152:50.25]I'm out of gas.
[152:50.67]I'm out of gas.
[152:51.09]I'm out of gas.
[152:51.55]Please.
[152:51.85]I'm out of gas.
[152:57.02]No, I'm not out of gas.
[153:00.58]Oh, I just barely made it.
[153:12.51]Jesus, man.
[153:13.35]This is so expensive.
[153:16.25]How much money do I even have?
[153:17.25]Alright.
[153:19.02]You don't have enough money in your wallet.
[153:20.88]Wallet?
[153:22.98]Just go to work.
[153:28.02]I got work in 20 minutes.
[153:29.44]Let's go.
[153:36.72]Nope.
[153:38.26]That's the kiss door.
[153:39.00]I'm not going in there.
[153:43.46]Just live downtown.
[153:45.12]Can you add forehead at that end of that sentence, please?
[153:52.73]I think I have the superpowers, I think.
[154:01.02]136 bucks.
[154:01.44]Let's fill that tank.
[154:03.96]That should be in my wallet, right?
[154:04.99]I just got paid.
[154:11.35]Yeah, alright.
[154:11.95]Fill this tank up.
[154:12.61]I don't want to get gas ever again for this damn car.
[154:30.10]Let's go with half tank.
[154:33.68]Okay.
[154:34.34]That's going to get us a pretty long ways.
[154:37.10]Open.
[154:37.82]Okay, hold on.
[154:41.24]Go to the club.
[154:47.88]No, not this shit again.
[154:48.99]That guy just ran into a school bus.
[155:00.71]So did you.
[155:01.31]No, the school bus ran into me.
[155:14.18]Is this illegal?
[155:16.22]Is there nudity in this game?
[155:20.38]Hide screen quick.
[155:21.33]Alright, let me see if there's nudity.
[155:22.29]Is there nudity here?
[155:49.43]This is lap dance area.
[155:50.88]I gotta leave.
[155:57.68]That's fine.
[156:00.62]It's fine.
[156:07.58]It's kind of ResidentSleeper in here, I'll be honest.
[156:20.55]React, react.
[156:22.21]Oh, sure, okay.
[156:23.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's in there?
[156:27.82]Oh, I think there might be naked girls in there.
[156:32.12]No way, dude.
[156:33.74]What's with naked girls?
[156:57.88]That was my mom?
[157:03.48]No, it wasn't.
[157:07.88]Go to work.
[157:09.24]Oh, shit!
[157:09.87]I forgot about work!
[157:12.03]What time is it?
[157:13.17]No, I have to sleep, dude.
[157:14.39]No.
[157:25.36]You were at work.
[157:26.00]Yeah, I just was at work, and then I went into that fucking snooze club.
[157:45.49]I mean, no one was even dressed up as Tracer in there.
[157:48.70]I don't like it!
[157:51.24]Don't hit this guy!
[158:05.39]Okay, I gotta go to sleep.
[158:07.65]And I'm very hungry.
[158:09.85]I need a fridge.
[158:10.55]And it's hot in here.
[158:11.35]How many complaints a minute can I do?
[158:26.39]You haven't shitted in two weeks.
[158:29.45]That happens when you eat candy every single day for every meal.
[158:33.67]It kind of bunches you up a little.
[158:42.18]What should you get from McDonald's?
[158:43.80]Hey, my order.
[158:45.52]Get the Jerma985.
[158:46.14]Except don't say I'll take the Jerma985 because I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
[158:52.18]That's two McChickens with a little bit of mayo.
[158:54.74]Oh, sorry.
[158:55.26]Can't order that.
[158:56.17]Those don't exist anymore.
[158:57.77]Don't get the spicy ones.
[158:58.51]They're not that good.
[159:00.05]It's a Big Mac.
[159:01.21]Sure.
[159:01.95]Get that.
[159:07.51]I'm too pissed off that they got rid of McChickens to continue doing that little bit I was doing there.
[159:12.11]Maybe I should get a bucket of mushrooms.
[159:18.17]Nachos.
[159:19.83]Octopus balls.
[159:21.77]Sounds good to me.
[159:29.09]No, they didn't.
[159:29.53]Yes, they did.
[159:30.97]There's no regular McChicken anymore.
[159:34.45]It's only Spiced McChicken.
[159:35.53]They don't have them.
[159:43.32]Yes, there is.
[159:44.22]How come I can't get them?
[159:45.94]Spicy is better, though.
[159:48.70]You're stupid.
[159:50.84]Wrong.
[159:51.08]I ate one today.
[159:51.76]They must have been out of stock for like a month.
[159:53.77]I'm telling you.
[159:56.41]What?
[159:56.79]No.
[160:02.75]I tried.
[160:03.11]Ooh.
[160:03.39]Ooh.
[160:13.78]I don't hate the spicy McChicken.
[160:15.44]Yes, I will.
[160:15.92]People, what the spicy?
[160:19.42]Everything has to have spicy.
[160:22.67]Spicy McChicken.
[160:23.77]Spicy Big Mac.
[160:25.49]Spicy soda.
[160:29.43]If you put spicy in front of something, apparently it sells.
[160:32.17]I don't know why.
[160:38.24]You know what?
[160:38.62]What's the difference between a spicy McChicken and a regular McChicken?
[160:41.44]The spicy McChicken makes your nose run.
[160:43.30]That's it.
[160:51.83]I can open cases?
[160:58.63]Shut up, wanker.
[161:05.04]Dude, let's open a case.
[161:07.14]CSGO case!
[161:09.67]Oh my god, am I gonna get the knife?
[161:16.29]Come on, do it.
[161:16.99]Whoa!
[161:19.89]I just made some money.
[161:31.28]Dude, a green Mac-10?
[161:32.32]That sucks.
[161:33.02]It's not even purple.
[161:34.74]I got mail.
[161:35.32]I got email.
[161:38.79]Do that on stream.
[161:41.39]I would rather you pull out every hair on my body individually with a pair of tweezers over the course of a few hours than me to do an open CSGO box stream.
[161:55.74]I would rather do that.
[161:56.62]Blender payment.
[162:00.14]Oh.
[162:07.13]I just don't want to do that.
[162:08.31]I've done that before a couple of times with like TF2 opening crates.
[162:12.90]I don't like it.
[162:14.24]I don't want to do that.
[162:14.82]Oh my fucking god, leave me alone.
[162:20.56]Open the crates for YouTube.
[162:21.64]Holy shit, that's genius actually.
[162:23.13]F-V-T-O.
[162:31.65]And it's Lucas again.
[162:32.47]Yes, like clockwork, Lucas tries to hack my computer every three days.
[162:48.31]I feel like it's automated at this point.
[162:49.53]You just check and see if he's using that password anywhere else.
[163:10.03]I gotta go to work.
[163:20.43]Alright, okay.
[163:22.18]New rule.
[163:23.08]I'm not gonna do any gambling until I have at least 500 bucks.
[163:25.46]And then I'm probably gonna go all in on one hand.
[163:28.62]Wait, do I have any parts I can sell?
[163:29.78]Ooh, sell the beans to that guy.
[163:35.54]Wait, can I just go rob my friend's house?
[163:36.83]He had a bunch of computer parts.
[163:37.85]Yeah.
[163:37.95]Yeah.
[163:51.02]Where's the... What happened to the beans?
[164:01.38]I put them in the trunk?
[164:04.79]I didn't put them in my backpack?
[164:09.15]I swear to God.
[164:12.05]He in the grass?
[164:12.85]I don't think that's gonna work, man.
[164:22.59]Three bucks.
[164:23.45]Alright, I'm not going to bargain for this.
[164:24.87]Of course I am.
[164:28.29]Inspired beans.
[164:29.93]Of course, I'll take $10 for that one.
[164:32.79]An extra 50 cents, whatever.
[164:34.05]Give me that money.
[164:35.39]Enough for food.
[164:45.16]I'm kind of obsessed with this game.
[164:46.82]I don't know why.
[164:48.88]There's something about it.
[164:49.94]There's like scratch tickets.
[164:51.36]There's blackjack.
[164:54.06]There's streaming.
[164:54.76]Alright, what time is it?
[165:08.09]I have to pay bills.
[165:08.83]What happens if you don't pay the bills?
[165:10.41]Alright, I got a hundred bucks.
[165:15.08]Let's go to work.
[165:16.36]I've missed work, but it's okay.
[165:19.41]Lifetime weight change.
[165:20.31]I lost one pound.
[165:21.85]Calories over the course of your whole life.
[165:24.71]I've only consumed 6,666 calories.
[165:29.69]Over the course of a month.
[165:33.67]This is not in the game yet.
[165:36.99]Alright, let's go... I don't know.
[165:38.46]Let's go explore for a little bit.
[165:43.86]No, no, no.
[165:44.66]Stream!
[165:45.18]I gotta... Streaming!
[165:46.42]What am I doing?
[165:47.04]This is streamer simulator.
[165:52.93]I got plenty of energy.
[165:53.77]Let's go.
[165:54.17]We're doing a big 24-hour stream right now.
[165:57.57]I'm beating Dark Souls on stream today.
[165:59.04]Let's go.
[166:04.68]What's up, guys?
[166:13.91]Today's the day.
[166:14.61]Dark Souls is going to get completed on stream.
[166:24.71]Finally gonna beat it.
[166:25.39]Favorite emote?
[166:29.91]LOL.
[166:33.13]They didn't like that apparently.
[166:37.56]Fuck all of you.
[166:41.94]Oop!
[166:42.64]Somebody gave some money!
[166:50.95]This should be an 18 plus category.
[166:54.19]Alright.
[166:55.01]Sure.
[166:55.51]Fine.
[166:58.88]Oh, no.
[166:59.12]I went the wrong way.
[167:03.64]You're a king.
[167:04.36]There's some more money.
[167:11.14]I gotta turn Spotify on.
[167:16.07]There.
[167:16.27]That's gonna bring in the viewers.
[167:19.47]How can I reach you?
[167:20.15]I have to ask you something.
[167:21.23]I don't want you to reach me.
[167:36.47]I don't know who this guy is.
[167:41.25]Leave me alone.
[167:46.05]38 viewers.
[167:46.39]I've got to get to 100 followers.
[167:48.36]How am I supposed to get through this though?
[167:57.86]Seems impossible.
[168:03.79]It's not possible to do this.
[168:07.23]Someone says they know where you live.
[168:09.17]Okay.
[168:09.73]Whatever.
[168:16.71]There's a definite bot user.
[168:18.25]I opened a broadcast and it was not watched.
[168:20.13]This is weird.
[168:21.31]Fuck this stream.
[168:29.53]Can I just leave through anywhere?
[168:38.04]I don't even know.
[168:38.90]Somebody just got collateraled.
[168:42.79]Someone in chat insults those who subscribe.
[168:44.97]Ban his whole family.
[168:46.47]Okay, we've banned his entire family.
[168:51.51]That's loud.
[168:52.13]I'm getting a lot of donations this stream.
[168:59.60]I'm doing pretty good, I think.
[169:08.23]Honestly, I don't think I can beat this level.
[169:13.83]How do I do this part?
[169:21.64]You can't beat this part.
[169:28.04]Green spots.
[169:30.74]Yeah, I gotta go to that one, but I can't even go past here.
[169:34.74]Go in the corner.
[169:41.68]Oh, fuck.
[169:42.14]Okay, what about... Alright, I'll use the... Thanks for the tip!
[169:46.05]How much money do you want to make?
[169:57.52]Cry.
[169:58.24]Cry.
[169:58.80]Cry.
[169:59.00]You guys have said that before.
[169:59.98]You guys have done that.
[170:01.28]66 bucks.
[170:01.70]Let's go.
[170:06.04]What if I turn the stream on and just leave the desk and go to bed?
[170:14.58]Do it, cry.
[170:15.26]Oh, I gotta move this shit over.
[170:24.60]Cry, cry, cry.
[170:27.46]I gotta get a webcam, you're right.
[170:30.47]No more gambling.
[170:32.11]No gambling.
[170:34.43]I'm serious.
[170:39.65]Almost $50 scratch tickets.
[170:43.13]I gotta get to over a thousand bucks.
[170:47.60]And hold on.
[170:48.26]I gotta pay bills.
[170:49.52]Wait a second.
[170:50.26]This is bad.
[170:57.64]Don't do it.
[171:01.91]Please go take a shit.
[171:04.81]I'm fine.
[171:06.17]Okay, we need to go to the bank.
[171:07.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[171:08.27]I need to go to the bills app.
[171:10.21]I'm gonna... Speaking of going to the bathroom, I have to go to the bathroom right now.
[171:16.77]I have to do taxes, too?
[171:22.85]Oh, man.
[171:24.59]I've got to do taxes.
[171:29.81]Today, zero dollars.
[171:31.01]Pay it.
[171:32.27]Okay, electricity bill.
[171:35.47]What?
[171:40.78]Electricity bill.
[171:41.48]Due date of this penalty.
[171:42.84]Electricity bill.
[171:43.78]Fuck.
[171:50.15]It's taking all my money.
[171:51.15]I had the 200 bucks.
[171:57.55]What about taxes?
[171:58.50]Didn't I just pay taxes?
[172:08.18]I'm hungry.
[172:08.84]I'll order something.
[172:13.47]2020.
[172:13.57]Taxes.
[172:14.21]Just like in real life.
[172:15.33]Do taxes.
[172:17.03]Total unrecorded money.
[172:18.87]Tax rate.
[172:20.66]We will send your current tax to you as an invoice every four days.
[172:23.84]I have to pay taxes every four days?
[172:25.52]Tax rate.
[172:29.41]What's this?
[172:30.91]Value added tax.
[172:32.03]What is that?
[172:33.89]I have 9% tax rate, but I have to, what's this value added tax of 4%?
[172:38.65]Don't companies pay that?
[172:40.57]Doesn't like, isn't it like a company thing?
[172:42.47]Why is it an individual thing?
[172:50.54]It's an EU thing.
[172:51.64]But I thought like companies paid this.
[172:53.82]Why do I have to pay that?
[172:59.59]Companies don't pay shit.
[173:01.61]What's up?
[173:02.47]And excuse me, by the way, what's going on with that, by the way?
[173:09.35]Go to work.
[173:11.37]I'm going to work.
[173:12.21]By the way, 120 hertz.
[173:12.79]Thank you.
[173:13.17]1080 monitor.
[173:20.08]Is that some kind of currency thing?
[173:22.02]No, no work stream.
[173:24.90]I'm beating Dark Souls today, guys.
[173:26.24]You're still at 144p quality.
[173:38.89]Yeah, and I still pull in the fucking big numbers.
[173:41.59]My stream toxicity is at 120%.
[173:42.96]Why?
[173:43.04]What are these?
[173:48.96]Oh, I have 26 subs.
[173:50.46]Cool.
[173:52.78]That's way over the limit.
[173:54.40]I have to be nice now.
[173:59.10]That's not accurate.
[173:59.82]You guys are calm.
[174:02.21]The mood of the stream.
[174:03.35]Let's just chill.
[174:04.77]Chill.
[174:05.45]Chill.
[174:05.67]Everybody chill.
[174:06.15]Let's get that number done.
[174:07.17]Thanks for the money.
[174:12.25]Everybody relax.
[174:13.45]We're just chilling today.
[174:14.27]Why is that toxic?
[174:20.40]I hate all of you stupid nerds.
[174:27.22]I reported your stream.
[174:28.56]Why?
[174:29.50]Why are we so toxic?
[174:30.80]Everybody fucking relax.
[174:33.08]It's boring.
[174:33.74]This stream's boring.
[174:34.47]I have $2.
[174:35.13]I cannot be a sub if I find money.
[174:37.41]Why is everybody like this right now?
[174:41.45]The toxicity is too high.
[174:42.63]How do I calm everybody down?
[174:48.99]I need more viewers.
[174:49.79]I only have 30.
[174:51.75]What happened?
[174:53.49]Good morning.
[174:58.91]Legend is back.
[174:59.97]Hey, I'm losing viewers.
[175:05.07]25, that's it?
[175:05.81]I gotta do something crazy.
[175:08.15]Oh, no, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[175:11.09]Play music.
[175:12.11]Wait, hold on.
[175:12.71]I'm trying to beat the game.
[175:13.33]Okay, hold on.
[175:16.35]I'll get, uh, let's get...
[175:20.96]I know, wait, wait, I know I'm supposed to beat this, but hold on.
[175:24.34]Oh shit, my tax rate!
[175:27.72]I don't want you guys to see that.
[175:28.74]Hey!
[175:35.44]I know how much you guys love this shit!
[175:37.80]We're gonna open some cases on stream!
[175:43.82]Ooh!
[175:44.80]People like that one, don't they?
[175:46.32]I got a really slow connection.
[175:51.14]27 bucks.
[175:51.76]I cannot watch this stream, but I leave my support.
[175:53.64]Thank you very much.
[175:54.53]Thank you, too.
[175:55.43]Thank all of you.
[175:56.63]I'm an idiot because I sent money.
[175:57.87]No, you're not.
[175:58.61]Cry, cry.
[175:59.39]10 out of 6.
[176:01.67]I don't know what that means.
[176:02.59]Thanks for the 10.
[176:03.71]Ooh, thanks for the money.
[176:04.93]Just read them all quickly.
[176:05.97]Read, read, read, read, read.
[176:07.25]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[176:09.84]Thank you, thank you.
[176:10.82]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[176:12.84]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[176:14.46]Alright, here we go.
[176:15.04]Case opening.
[176:18.72]Do not ban me.
[176:21.39]Alright, just minimize this.
[176:23.78]I got 78 people here, man.
[176:24.46]Come on.
[176:26.50]No.
[176:27.20]Minimize this.
[176:29.00]Okay.
[176:30.26]We're gonna open a super case today, guys.
[176:34.62]This is 50 bucks.
[176:35.38]We're looking for blue.
[176:38.86]Come on.
[176:40.02]Give me that knife.
[176:44.51]Oh!
[176:44.93]Too bad.
[176:45.77]Too bad.
[176:46.37]Too bad.
[176:46.87]Too bad.
[176:47.21]Dang ho!
[176:47.65]Whoa!
[176:49.23]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[176:49.99]I opened one case.
[176:53.87]Oh, offline subs.
[176:55.91]Bug.
[176:57.63]I've opened one case at end of stream.
[176:59.27]I made, how much money did I make?
[177:02.02]Seven.
[177:04.50]I was at 17 bucks.
[177:08.74]It's because Twitch took 70.
[177:11.12]Twitch is taking 70.
[177:11.80]It's not Twitch.
[177:12.20]It's Twitch.
[177:19.33]You spent it on cases.
[177:20.47]No, but that was... They take... Didn't it say they take 70%?
[177:24.67]I didn't see what it was.
[177:26.11]Somebody tell me.
[177:26.59]Quick, quick, quick.
[177:27.15]I didn't see.
[177:27.51]I didn't see.
[177:27.89]Somebody, please.
[177:28.47]It's like a 10 second... Now he's just fucking with me.
[177:52.61]Oh my goodness.
[177:53.19]I don't have food.
[177:54.34]Alright, I'm gonna go on a food shopping.
[177:57.90]I need a fridge.
[177:58.98]I'm obsessed with this game.
[178:00.34]I can't stop.
[178:09.03]I'm gonna buy.
[178:09.67]I need a fridge.
[178:12.35]It's stressful.
[178:15.75]If the donation's over 10, it goes to your bank automatically.
[178:18.01]Oh, okay.
[178:18.87]Yeah, but didn't it say that they take 70-80% of the money?
[178:23.04]It said that on, like, the thing we were looking at, didn't it?
[178:25.28]In the very beginning?
[178:30.08]That's for subs.
[178:30.92]Oh.
[178:33.16]Let's get, uh, three burritos.
[178:40.70]Why don't I go to- I just eat burritos and donuts.
[178:43.57]And canned, like, mealworms.
[178:45.97]Why can't I go to the grocery store?
[179:03.02]Waiting for the food.
[179:05.88]I gotta pee so bad.
[179:06.78]Alright, let me pee.
[179:08.34]I'll be right back.
[179:09.16]I'm gonna eat this and pee.
[179:11.02]I'll sleep.
[179:16.49]Okay, how long does this last?
[179:18.47]Was it last?
[179:19.97]Storage on this thing.
[179:22.25]I just put burritos in my backpack.
[179:23.51]They're fresh.
[179:27.59]Okay.
[179:28.33]It's probably fresh for a couple days.
[179:30.27]I would assume, right?
[179:30.94]Okay.
[179:34.57]Hygiene's alright.
[179:35.22]Let's shower, get some rest.
[179:39.78]Alright, and I'll be right back.
[179:40.54]I have to actually pee in real life.
[179:42.84]Be right back.
[183:05.04]Okay.
[183:07.76]It's hot in this room.
[183:08.52]It's hot in here.
[183:10.50]Fuck Vegas.
[183:11.00]I'm moving.
[183:11.58]I'm out of here.
[183:12.24]It's too hot.
[183:14.83]I actually love it like this.
[183:19.11]I'm a weirdo.
[183:26.91]I'm one of those insane people that really actually truly enjoys hot, hot, 100 plus degree weather.
[183:36.74]Let's go back.
[183:38.08]What were we doing?
[183:43.86]What the fuck are these mods doing?
[183:45.00]The whole chat.
[183:45.86]Is something wrong with it?
[183:52.47]Next game, please.
[183:53.71]No.
[183:55.85]Sorry.
[184:02.59]What's the toxicity of this chat?
[184:04.19]Yeah, I wonder.
[184:06.43]40.
[184:07.17]Maybe 30 or 40%.
[184:11.65]I need a better microphone, too.
[184:12.75]I need more money.
[184:13.63]I need everything.
[184:18.95]It's happening tomorrow.
[184:22.19]You want your real fuckface stream?
[184:24.35]It's going to be tomorrow afternoon.
[184:26.03]I sweated.
[184:26.65]This place is hot.
[184:29.44]It is.
[184:30.04]I like it, though.

[190:03.37]Okay, guys, this is for you.
[190:04.57]This is for the stream.
[190:05.85]This is the big one for the stream.
[190:08.39]We just passed 100 concurrent viewers.
[190:12.34]$50 bet for the stream.
[190:16.42]Oh, and it's a good one.
[190:18.96]Oh, it's not a good one.
[190:20.10]We have to stand here.
[190:22.97]ooooh hahahaha too bad oh no I lost some money ooooh okay guys I'm gonna uh I got uh I gotta go oh wait how long has the stream been off how long was the stream off for was I even streaming
[190:57.54]Imagine watching some sick fuck like this at 144p at 700 bitrate Talking like that and losing some money and then just ending stream every day like that This is bizarre At least I got some more subs
[191:26.29]You never turned it on.
[191:28.37]Yes, I did.
[191:28.85]I saw the viewer count.
[191:39.08]What's wrong with your voice?
[191:41.02]Are you imitating somebody or are you actually asking that question?
[191:45.69]Turn the stream right now to 144p, 700 bitrate.
[191:49.91]I don't think I can do that.
[191:56.47]I would have to turn the stream off and back on again.
[191:59.07]Alright, I promise I will do that before this stream is over.
[192:03.97]I have no money.
[192:10.48]Get a loan.
[192:12.92]Holy shit.
[192:15.98]Daily installment payments of 800 bucks.
[192:17.84]That's not going to work.
[192:21.00]I'll do it.
[192:21.62]I promise I'll do it.
[192:27.40]It'll break everything.
[192:29.98]Yeah, guys, we're like hanging out, having a fun time.
[192:33.46]I'm not just going to turn the stream off.
[192:35.22]Here's the thing.
[192:35.76]This is some streamer insight for you guys.
[192:38.40]If I turn the stream off, even though there's 10,000 people here, you all know that I'm coming back.
[192:44.93]But like 4,000 of you are gone permanently.
[192:47.75]You're just going to leave.
[192:49.35]That's just how it works.
[192:56.57]I actually think it would be, like, kind of a fun experiment to, like, turn a stream off and back on, like, 30 times and see if you get down to zero.
[193:04.87]Will one person stick around after you go through?
[193:07.41]What's the diminishing returns?
[193:13.63]I have to go to work.
[193:15.56]Have I eaten?
[193:16.00]Alright, I'm okay.
[193:24.58]I would stay.
[193:29.38]Thanks.
[193:31.76]Okay, I mean it.
[193:32.98]No more gambling.
[193:35.22]I would rather eat food on stream.
[193:36.70]I'm gonna eat food on stream with a webcam.
[193:38.36]That's the new meta.
[193:39.04]What do you mean gas is gonna run out soon?
[193:48.05]I just got it.
[193:48.51]Excuse me.
[193:52.65]Can I just buy gas?
[194:05.22]Yeah, I'm gonna put on ASMR webcam with food.
[194:24.97]I know, I know.
[194:29.59]Someone siphoned gas from the car?
[194:31.19]I feel like they did.
[194:35.44]We want you to butt chug.
[194:38.56]Time that person out for real.
[194:40.68]For at least two minutes.
[194:42.60]And I'm serious on that one.
[194:44.66]That's a serious time that person out.
[194:46.90]We make that joke all the time.
[194:48.17]Oh, ban that guy.
[194:48.95]Oh, mod him.
[194:50.79]Really time that guy out for two minutes.
[194:53.77]I want him to sit here and think.
[194:55.13]He's looking at his screen saying, we want you to butt chug.
[194:58.39]I said that.
[194:59.29]I want this guy to butt chug.
[195:00.59]Yeah, I did say that.
[195:03.48]Alright, I'm back.
[195:04.12]I'm back.
[195:04.52]I'm okay.
[195:05.14]I'm sorry for saying that.
[195:10.37]Start time.
[195:10.87]What?

[195:13.19]Well, we'll just... No, I'm early.
[195:15.17]I'm really early.
[195:16.57]I'm so ready to work.
[195:18.19]Oh, God!
[195:18.77]I'm here two or three hours early.

[195:24.06]No, I'll be here.

[195:27.62]I'm here.
[195:34.26]Oh, I know.
[195:34.68]I'll just tell people to come in the restaurant.
[195:35.86]I'll point at the restaurant and be like a dancing guy in a costume outside.
[195:38.66]Go to the strip club.
[195:44.12]No, I'm not going to spend any money.
[195:45.55]This is eerie.
[195:58.01]Just standing out here.
[195:58.93]Okay, hold on.
[196:13.53]Look out the back window as you know kids typically when they look out the back window and they go like If you ever pull up behind a school bus at a red light, there's always like four or five kids that are always like Pointing at you out the window and then you go like You like cover your eyes and your ears and you go bow and they go Wow Wave I got the window.
[196:40.17]Hey good.
[196:40.63]Oh
[196:48.56]I forgot I have to work, right.
[196:52.93]And then when the light turns green, and three or four seconds go by, and the school bus driver hasn't gone yet.
[196:59.76]They didn't leave it.
[197:00.66]They mean it's green light.

[209:02.93]Beef jerky lasts like forever.
[209:04.07]Get two of these.
[209:15.00]Get fat.
[209:16.28]Somebody called me fat, right?
[209:19.70]Somebody was like, oh, you've become obese.
[209:21.72]I was like, how the fuck do you know that?
[209:27.85]We're streaming enough to get medicine, and then we're gonna stream permanently.
[209:34.75]It was, you are obese on the computer.
[209:36.52]Yeah.
[209:39.28]Thank you!
[209:40.02]Alright, clam soup.
[209:44.04]Eat it.
[209:45.40]Burrito, eat it.
[209:46.10]Okay, eat this clam soup because that will probably not keep very well.
[209:52.30]100.
[209:52.87]Store the rest in my backpack.
[209:59.31]Does it matter if it hits the ground?
[210:02.55]I hope not.
[210:02.91]Okay.
[210:15.08]Somebody said European taxes and American healthcare.
[210:20.24]Okay, let's stream.
[210:21.29]I need medicine.
[210:27.99]I know.
[210:28.51]I'm working on it.
[210:29.55]Let's go.

[210:47.12]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[210:51.76]Okay, everybody.
[210:53.62]I want you to relax while we...
[211:10.48]Everybody breathe in and breathe out.
[211:31.32]Fuck this stream.
[211:32.14]What?
[211:32.36]Is it loud?
[211:37.15]Oh, it's actually going.
[211:38.11]I don't have both earphones in, guys.
[211:39.75]I only have my right one in.
[211:44.55]I didn't know that it was... Hold on.
[211:50.14]I'm getting a ton of donations.
[211:51.24]I have to keep doing it.
[212:29.01]Where's the toilet one?
[212:41.70]Which one is the toilet?
[212:51.60]Okay.
[212:53.32]Thank you for your subscriptions.
[212:56.08]Got 44.
[212:56.18]It's 19.
[213:04.17]Is there a lottery?
[213:04.97]How do we have so much toxicity?
[213:06.73]Just relax and enjoy the tingles.
[213:08.99]Oh.
[213:09.31]Hold on a sec.
[213:10.16]Thank you.

[213:53.92]Valti, thanks for the sub.

[214:04.31]Appreciate it.
[214:05.45]I love you very much.
[214:06.23]I'm preparing a surprise for my darling.
[214:08.00]Read my name.
[214:08.60]Do you say your lover?
[214:10.30]Is this live?
[214:13.78]Yes, it is.
[214:17.08]Uh-uh.
[214:24.50]Wake up!
[214:30.29]Stream turned off.
[214:45.59]How much money did we make today from our ASMR stream?
[214:50.91]Ooh, 50 bucks.
[214:51.88]Alright, same thing tomorrow.
[214:53.04]I got backpack full of burritos.
[215:01.50]That was a madhouse laugh?
[215:11.96]I will pay you any amount of money to never do that again.
[215:14.04]Okay, the amount is 500 million dollars.
[215:19.60]Okay.
[215:29.93]Back at it again.
[215:30.69]Eat the food in my inventory and then let's go.
[215:32.75]This is a little dirty.
[215:36.81]That's okay, right?
[215:38.07]I'm kind of afraid to eat this with 11 health.
[215:42.38]I'm gonna sell it to the fucking guy.
[215:44.36]Yeah, let's sell it.
[215:55.09]I'm terrified.
[215:55.99]I have 11 health.
[215:56.67]Even if I lose like 5, that's really bad.
[215:58.27]5 bucks.
[216:06.29]I'll take it.
[216:06.80]I'll take it.
[216:07.12]Let's go.
[216:24.70]Do I need to use the bathroom?
[216:26.38]I do.
[216:26.72]I don't have any money.
[216:29.76]Why?
[216:30.04]What are we doing?
[216:35.34]Okay, I've eaten.
[216:36.04]I'm going to have some beef jerky.
[216:40.02]Why is this dirty?
[216:41.44]It's beef jerky.
[216:43.06]If I lose health, I'm going to be mad.
[216:49.52]Oh, shit.
[216:49.78]There's even more in here.
[216:50.56]I don't know.
[216:53.24]That's pretty awesome, actually.
[216:54.79]Alright.
[216:55.05]Store that.
[216:57.43]Hog.
[216:59.15]Yep.
[217:00.83]Only buy beef jerky.
[217:01.59]It's like the best food ever, apparently.
[217:02.63]Alright.
[217:03.87]I'm back.
[217:04.83]We're not doing ASMR.
[217:05.69]We're doing a creative stream today.
[217:12.88]Okay.
[217:18.65]Let's do some paintings.
[217:20.97]I'm not going to be reading any sub or chat messages today, guys.
[217:23.71]I'm concentrating on my art.
[217:28.69]Thank you, whoever that was.
[217:32.99]Just drop the pen.
[217:40.14]That's an eraser.
[217:40.92]Okay, hold on.
[217:47.80]I need to...
[218:05.51]Why do we keep climbing with toxicity?
[218:07.65]This is so annoying.
[218:18.71]Good morning.
[218:22.79]I'm just trying to draw a face.
[218:26.71]Next pen.
[218:27.27]I need medicine.
[218:27.91]I'll get it after this.
[218:44.70]Looking for a favorite streamer?
[218:45.66]That's gonna be me, I guarantee it!
[218:47.27]Alright, can I sell this to one of the viewers?
[218:54.73]Alright, can I sell this?
[219:00.73]Zerick opened a stream.
[219:02.25]Let this disgusting stream.
[219:06.11]How do I lower this?
[219:08.73]Am I just that unbearable?
[219:10.21]People are giving me money though.
[219:14.84]I'm getting a ton of money.
[219:18.96]Look at all these subscriptions.
[219:20.62]Look at all this.
[219:21.54]This is crazy.
[219:22.04]This is a sub train.
[219:25.45]This is a huge amount of subs.
[219:32.03]Okay, that was cool.
[219:32.93]Now let's erase this and let's make a new one.
[219:36.24]The legend is back.
[219:37.00]That's right.
[219:37.48]Here I am.
[219:37.84]This is going to take too long to erase, so I'm just going to go like this.
[219:45.04]And let's... Here.
[219:49.42]You want to see my bank account?
[219:52.46]It's still at 144p.
[219:56.11]I'll show you guys my bank account on stream.
[220:02.71]Hey, look.
[220:03.09]Here's my actual thumbprint.
[220:05.97]I have 56 bucks.
[220:10.22]I have... I'm going to transfer money to my card.
[220:12.64]I have like 80 bucks or so.
[220:17.50]Wanna watch me get a loan on stream?
[220:21.87]500 bucks, and you have three days to pay it off.
[220:24.09]I'm never gonna be able to do that.
[220:25.17]That's way too much.
[220:26.81]More subs.
[220:27.27]I know everybody in Blender.
[220:30.11]I see you first stream.
[220:31.27]How long has the stream started?
[220:32.60]How long do you have been doing this for a job?
[220:35.94]Uh... Sorry, mic off for now.
[220:46.47]He's a waiter.
[220:51.09]Look who it is!
[220:54.79]Nod... Nod P. Getting hacked on stream.
[220:59.97]But blocked him.
[221:02.29]Still streaming this.
[221:04.01]Okay, stream's over.
[221:09.72]I wanna play one of the other games!
[221:19.17]Why did I install Fall Guys?
[221:24.25]I need medicine though.
[221:27.25]Okay.
[221:27.93]I've got $92.
[221:28.69]That's not enough.
[221:33.26]I think I have to just get lucky at blackjack.
[221:37.70]Eat some beef jerky and go to bed.
[221:38.64]Do it again.
[221:42.58]I can't uninstall fall gang.
[221:48.33]I want to play Counter-Strike.
[221:50.11]Or FIFA.
[221:56.97]Can I?
[221:57.25]Wait, computer.
[221:58.17]Oh, hold on a second.
[222:02.75]Can I go in there and take it out?
[222:08.64]No, no.
[222:09.38]Wait, I don't have a microphone.
[222:11.78]No, I do.
[222:12.18]Okay.
[222:12.36]I was like, wait a minute.
[222:16.30]Alright, let's eat food and go to bed.
[222:20.16]Where's my beef jerky?
[222:22.50]Didn't I have two?
[222:22.98]I thought I had two of these.
[222:37.22]No.
[222:38.28]Take out a massive loan and then do a hand in blackjack for all of it.
[222:43.16]I don't... I think that's a really, really bad idea.
[222:49.04]Go look in trash and see if you can find anything.
[222:52.00]Nothing in this trash.
[222:59.17]Alright, I'm going to go look around all the dumpsters.
[223:05.35]Nothing in here.
[223:09.69]I want to buy like a cat and have a dog and stuff.
[223:12.21]I need to make some money.
[223:13.39]Any more trashes to look through?
[223:21.05]You have to press space?
[223:25.95]Take trash space.
[223:28.64]Oh, there's nothing here.
[223:29.56]Move.
[223:30.52]Whoa!
[223:30.96]Does this hurt?
[223:41.57]I think that might hurt.
[223:42.95]No.
[223:43.19]Alright, we're good.
[223:50.29]This is free shit.
[223:52.21]It is.
[223:52.49]Ooh, a gas bottle.
[224:00.47]Ooh, plastic crate.
[224:03.31]I don't have any more motivation to be in the trash anymore.
[224:06.31]What do these things do?
[224:08.95]This is a... I can sell it to a dealer.
[224:12.19]I can sell it to a dealer.
[224:13.25]I can sell these to a dealer.
[224:14.29]Let's go make some money.
[224:19.26]Zero hygiene.
[224:19.86]He's gonna be mad.
[224:20.56]Take a shower.
[224:28.71]Maybe I can trade him for some medicine.
[224:41.19]What's up?
[224:42.35]I've got some things for you to look at.
[224:43.43]I've got a water bottle for you to look at.
[224:45.27]Nine bucks.
[224:45.91]I've got a gas canister.
[224:47.43]That's a lot of money.
[224:48.67]And a plastic crate.
[224:50.52]I think we can make a little bit better of a deal there, I think.
[225:00.10]Fuck you.
[225:03.26]More trash?
[225:05.99]Nice!
[225:07.83]Oh, how do I get more trash motivation?
[225:11.39]I think it's a skill point.
[225:14.22]Garbage motivation decreases more slowly.
[225:16.14]How much is it?
[225:16.62]I don't have money to do that.
[225:17.58]Alright.
[225:24.44]Back on the stream.
[225:28.73]No, you know what?
[225:31.47]I think I'm gonna take like five jobs.
[225:35.29]Yeah.
[225:36.97]I'm gonna try to make like 500 bucks in two days.
[225:43.92]Freelancers.
[225:44.66]What's this?
[225:49.60]Gamble alone, you idiot.
[225:50.94]Imagine telling somebody saying the words gamble alone and then a space bar and then writing you idiot.
[225:59.53]Ooh, coding?
[226:00.23]Do I know how to code?
[226:06.99]You should get a key by finding capital letters and numbers from within the scattered code block.
[226:12.18]You must enter the keys by typing code at the beginning.
[226:16.04]Get a key by finding capital letters and numbers within the scattered code.
[226:19.99]So I need capital letters and numbers in here.
[226:22.79]Okay.
[226:25.47]So then I type in code and then wherever you have to look for, let's go.
[226:31.31]Here we go.

[236:03.36]Get better internet.
[236:04.62]There's a lot of things I want to get.
[236:07.34]Bills.
[236:14.18]Why is beef jerky more expensive than a whole... I can't even talk.
[236:17.18]I'm sorry.
[236:19.15]Words that just have trouble coming out sometimes.
[236:21.45]I'll get it in a second.
[236:22.37]It's the leader of the door.
[236:24.45]No bills.
[236:26.21]Can I see some pogs in the chat for no bills?
[236:30.17]You know, I've started to really like that word pog.
[236:33.45]I'm older than a lot of you guys, but it's fun to say sometimes.
[236:43.64]Okay, let's throw these on the shelf.
[236:48.03]That better not be dirty.
[236:48.77]Where did that go?
[236:53.79]Dude, did I... Are you fucking kidding me?
[237:01.63]Just keep it in my backpack, I don't care.
[237:03.27]Where'd it go?

[237:08.44]I gotta use the bathroom too.
[237:10.72]Don't touch my beef jerky, it's out here.
[237:13.90]It's mine.
[237:14.30]Don't touch this.

[240:29.23]I know everybody in the blender.
[240:30.19]See, I think the 18 plus.
[240:31.83]Chatting people wonder what you think about the shape of the world.
[240:34.09]The world is flat.
[240:35.01]The world is flat.
[240:37.08]We're going to do.
[240:37.58]We're going to.

[240:42.98]F. A. S. E. Wrong.
[241:00.97]20 bucks.
[241:03.27]That's not even worth doing.
[241:04.05]It's 10 bucks.
[241:11.76]Worse than FTK?
[241:13.32]Get out of here.
[241:15.36]I'm scrolling over my chat.
[241:16.64]I'm going to ban you.
[241:17.46]Alright, let's go.
[241:26.15]Medicine.
[241:26.49]Medicine.
[241:33.03]Alright, I can buy the medicine.
[241:34.45]200 bucks.
[241:35.15]It's such a money sink.
[241:36.29]I need money.
[241:36.93]Ah!
[242:03.80]This guy's a positive streamer.
[242:05.38]I'm not as toxic as this guy.
[242:06.72]Alright, so I said you guys are about 30-40% toxic on that meter.
[242:11.62]Where am I?
[242:12.70]Over 50?
[242:13.00]Under 50?
[242:13.24]50%?
[242:13.26]There's nothing in there.
[242:33.14]How come you have nothing in there?
[242:36.02]Just crap.
[242:47.97]Take it!
[242:51.32]Fuck.
[242:51.74]Whatever, I'll just sell it to him.
[243:03.77]Why is there even a wallet in the game?
[243:05.13]Why can I just swipe my credit card into the lock?
[243:07.71]Alright, let's go sell this stuff to this guy.
[243:17.88]And then I actually am gonna go and see if I can go take some computer parts out of that guy's house.
[243:23.56]Alright, I'll take pills.
[243:42.39]Get a better house?
[243:44.33]You see how much of a struggle it has been for me to keep $50 without blowing it on beef jerky and CSGO cases?
[243:54.04]You think I'm gonna get like hundreds of thousands of dollars?
[243:56.84]Alright, short stream today of me transferring money into my wallet.
[244:03.31]Just a quick one.
[244:11.12]Short stream of me, uh, just... Transferring money.
[244:25.25]What's the cap?
[244:28.49]Okay, let's transfer to my wallet.
[244:38.72]Let's just put like 50 bucks in here.
[244:41.70]And then let's transfer... Okay, we're good.
[244:45.28]No, I need 200!
[244:50.67]Total money in wallet.
[244:52.27]Total money on the card.
[244:54.29]Transfer this money back to my account.
[244:55.79]Give me... Transfer to wallet.
[245:02.28]Okay.
[245:02.92]Let's go get that medicine!
[245:17.75]The stream is still on?
[245:19.75]Okay.
[245:21.03]What am I, stupid?
[245:25.07]Why wouldn't I just turn the stream on and fucking leave and go to work?
[245:38.32]What if the computer gets hacked?
[245:44.58]You'll get hacked.
[245:45.88]Hasn't happened yet.
[245:48.00]Hey guys, I'm back!
[245:50.14]Childhood memory.
[245:51.00]Say you were a very clever baby.
[245:52.74]Tell the memory you pissed underneath.
[245:54.74]Okay, how much money do I got?
[246:00.18]Alright, I'm gonna keep, like, I'm keeping money on my wallet.
[246:07.14]Because, seriously, I need it.
[246:08.44]I have the gas and all that.
[246:09.76]Thanks, guys.
[246:12.76]84 viewers.
[246:16.89]I need to buy a webcam.
[246:17.83]That's really important.
[246:23.49]I have enough money to buy a webcam.
[246:43.32]Oh man!
[246:44.02]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[246:45.58]Who gave a lot of money?
[246:48.60]Just read them all on stream and they'll keep coming.
[247:03.41]Okay, I closed the stream.
[247:05.17]That's fine.
[247:05.75]I'll take the 160 bucks, please.
[247:08.11]Awesome.
[247:08.69]Now we're making moves.
[247:09.49]This is where it really gets... This is where it's going to be good.
[247:12.76]How much is a fridge?
[247:14.40]How much is a shitty fridge?
[247:15.82]200 bucks.
[247:16.30]I can afford that.
[247:20.40]I can afford it.
[247:22.26]Fridge and a webcam.
[247:36.32]112.
[247:36.66]God, Luke, just pick somebody else to do this to.
[247:44.69]Anybody else but me.
[247:52.47]Luke, I'm just gonna move.
[247:57.32]I'm gonna get a new house anyways.
[247:58.40]Alright.
[248:00.80]Ball?
[248:01.20]Webcam?
[248:02.24]This one here is 112 bucks.
[248:03.80]Streaming for webcams.
[248:05.68]I need 312 bucks.
[248:06.48]Alright, let's put that on the credit card.
[248:20.27]Level up.
[248:21.85]That's a fridge and a webcam.
[248:28.52]You need a toilet.
[248:29.14]Streaming comes first.
[248:29.84]Do I have any food?
[248:32.64]I do.
[248:35.94]Is this dirty?
[248:36.38]It's a little dirty.
[248:38.47]It's okay.
[248:38.83]It should be fine.
[248:42.07]Yeah, that's good.
[248:44.55]I got any money on the wallet?
[248:50.70]No.
[248:54.57]But I'm just like, my underwear is sagging behind me.
[249:00.33]Like Santa's knapsack.
[249:03.49]Like Santa has all your presents in there.
[249:09.44]Go to sleep.
[249:14.82]What, that's the grossest thing you've heard all day?
[249:16.60]Come on.
[249:17.22]It's been four hours.
[249:26.55]I'm a little gross, but not that gross, I don't think.
[249:28.53]There's a wheel in here.
[249:46.85]That fridge is huge.
[249:48.79]Can I fit this fridge in my house?
[249:53.29]It's as big as a doorway.
[249:55.93]Oh, dude, we're gonna have a streamer fridge!
[250:03.22]What an ugly fridge.
[250:05.42]That's the worst streamer fridge ever.
[250:07.00]Uh, alright, I can sell that.
[250:12.58]A Red Bull fridge.
[250:13.60]No, this is the fridge that... So, if you have a... If you buy a new fridge, this is the fridge that becomes the second fridge that ends up in your garage.
[250:31.49]Alright, let me go... I can buy a bunch of food now.
[250:35.67]That's the best part about this.
[250:36.59]I can actually buy food.
[250:37.37]I don't know why, but for a second I thought this was a second fridge lying down.
[250:43.71]I can buy and store food.
[250:46.95]Oh, thank goodness.
[250:47.59]A webcam.
[250:50.73]Get this shit on here.
[250:52.43]And I'm doing a webcam stream to test it out.
[250:54.09]Let's have the donations roll to fucking...
[251:13.17]Alright, settings.
[251:15.03]Full screen cam.
[251:17.01]Show cam.
[251:18.75]Recommended bitrate.
[251:19.59]Alright, stream settings.
[251:21.72]Full screen camera.
[251:29.32]Wait.
[251:30.20]Hey guys!
[251:31.82]Welcome to stream!
[251:35.09]I'm taking you guys on a- Oh, you can't do that.
[251:37.79]It's alright.
[251:38.27]I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[251:44.52]I got a cam now.
[251:45.28]What do you guys think?
[251:53.82]Thank you.
[251:54.34]I can't change this?
[252:03.79]What is this even a picture of?
[252:09.99]This is in the wrong spot.
[252:10.99]This is in a terrible spot.
[252:11.89]Wait, can I move the camera?
[252:15.27]Nice fucking slideshow.
[252:16.53]Wait, I have an idea.
[252:17.35]Are you serious?
[252:36.46]The computer's disconnected.
[252:38.14]I turned off the computer.
[252:42.72]What a shitty stream.
[252:50.03]Oh, that's so stupid.
[252:54.96]Can I get a chair that's not a baby high chair?
[253:01.70]Turn the computer- Turn it on!
[253:04.47]What's wrong with the computer?
[253:07.81]Stream in the bathroom.
[253:09.31]Oh, you're giving me ideas.
[253:10.53]I- Wait till I have my own house.
[253:27.06]Sorry, guys.
[253:29.26]That's my fault.
[253:31.84]I screwed up a little bit.
[253:32.66]I'm back.
[253:36.71]Can you see me?
[253:40.53]Please fix this.
[253:41.49]What's wrong with it?
[253:44.57]Misuse other streamers to attract viewers.
[253:47.63]Sure.
[253:47.83]I mean, just... How many people are coming in?
[253:51.56]40% of streamers.
[253:57.06]This game is so fucking... Talk about artistic things to improve the quality of the stream.
[254:01.18]Talk about beautiful pictures.
[254:02.94]Art is boring.
[254:03.72]Alright, let's talk about beautiful pictures.
[254:14.01]I need to point the webcam at my face.
[254:17.39]Stream trend.
[254:18.13]Focus on your own chat.
[254:19.31]Tell a story.
[254:20.35]Let's tell a story.
[254:26.32]Where are the donations?
[254:30.46]Ooh, here we go.
[254:31.24]It's time to do a joke.
[254:32.42]Cheap joke.
[254:33.33]Clever joke.
[254:37.47]Great stream.
[254:37.91]Thank you.
[254:40.85]Oh, I can pretend there's a sub trade so people will just start to subscribe because they think a sub trade's going on.
[254:47.29]Whoa, dude!
[254:50.67]Oh, that's not even... I thought that was real.
[254:54.27]People say that they are bored.
[255:00.05]Act like a clown.
[255:02.65]This is too real, man.
[255:06.16]This is too real for me.
[255:11.36]If you never make money on streaming, will you keep doing it?
[255:13.26]I'll do it for fun.
[255:18.99]Huge viewer count.
[255:19.73]Alright, I gotta do something crazy.
[255:23.47]What do I do?
[255:24.37]This is the most viewers I've ever had.
[255:27.52]Cat wonders what movie you like.
[255:28.66]I don't know.
[255:31.10]Action.
[255:32.61]Viewers are skyrocketing.
[255:33.45]I want to be a streamer, but the blender refused.
[255:42.35]Oh, fuck.
[255:44.79]That was pretty good, though.
[255:45.61]That was almost 200 concurrent viewers.
[255:47.11]That was a big deal.
[255:55.39]Put your face cam on the game's monitor?
[256:02.49]Yeah, I can't put it anywhere.
[256:09.86]I want to put it right here.
[256:10.62]Put it on the shelf.
[256:21.91]Look, I can't do it.
[256:24.13]Look, see?
[256:30.46]And by the way, what image is this even taking?
[256:32.30]Why is it not showing me?
[256:36.16]Do a feet cam?
[256:38.93]I don't think I can even do that.
[256:47.73]Come on!
[256:48.48]Alright, let's go.
[257:00.09]Stream outside your house.
[257:03.71]I need better internet.
[257:04.59]I need money too.
[257:07.50]This game is actually pretty hard.
[257:10.56]It really is.
[257:11.04]Try to get a better stream quality.
[257:18.44]Yeah, but people go drop, drop, drop veins.
[257:20.60]This stream sucks.
[257:21.48]Loser.
[257:21.82]Alright, let me do some trash digging.
[257:33.34]Damn it.
[257:43.26]Yeah, I need better internet first.
[257:48.19]Come on.
[257:48.73]Alright, do you want this weird wheel?
[257:50.71]How much is this worth?
[257:55.99]12 bucks.
[257:57.11]I have to take it.
[258:04.07]Alright, now is the time where I'm going to take a bunch of jobs, at least two jobs that I can go to, back to back.
[258:13.04]Let's take a look at our bank account.
[258:21.08]118 bucks.
[258:25.04]I feel like I'm always at 118 bucks.
[258:28.50]It's always at 1 to 200.
[258:34.28]Okay, stream.
[258:35.92]Hmm.
[258:38.16]What can I do here?
[258:41.32]Buy a toilet?
[258:41.88]I need 400 bucks.
[258:47.92]I want to just gamble.
[258:53.06]What is FastNet?
[259:00.42]Well, here's the thing.
[259:01.20]How much more is the better internet package?
[259:03.54]It might not be that much more.
[259:09.20]Holy shit, hold on.
[259:11.97]This is the package that I have.
[259:13.81]Two down, one up.
[259:15.99]This is four down, one up.
[259:18.63]That sucks.
[259:19.11]$20 for every four days?
[259:25.92]Or I could do turbo.
[259:28.12]You can buy a maximum of one turbo package every day.
[259:30.68]So, hold on a minute.
[259:32.10]If I stream, that's 300.
[259:33.44]That could be 3,000.
[259:34.64]Alright, let me get ready for that.
[259:38.85]I need to eat.
[259:42.15]I'm going to get sleep.
[259:42.95]And I'm going to turbo boost and do an insane IRL stream.
[259:50.83]I'm going to order some food.
[259:58.91]A turbo boost into the fucking bathroom.
[260:17.41]What are your opinions on this emote?
[260:19.49]Uh, let's see.
[260:23.03]Is that... Is that a bag on somebody's head?
[260:25.29]What is that?
[260:29.64]Alright, let's get food.
[260:31.18]Cheap food that I can put in the refrigerator.
[260:34.32]Let's get some sodas.
[260:35.58]Three sodas.
[260:37.04]Two waters.
[260:38.58]An energy bar.
[260:41.35]Uh, some, um, apple juice.
[260:46.41]Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me.
[260:53.23]I'm sorry.
[260:53.89]It's the first thing I thought of.
[260:55.41]I'm sorry.
[260:55.95]I know.
[260:57.29]Everyone's gonna do that.
[260:58.15]Everyone's gonna say, yeah, it was terrible, but come on.
[261:00.79]I had to do that.
[261:02.64]I had to do that.
[261:03.88]Stop treating me this way, or I'll start banning everybody.
[261:10.78]Don't make fun of me.
[261:11.76]I'm in control here.
[261:19.75]Alright, that's enough for now?
[261:21.92]No, you dick.
[261:33.92]Okay, I don't understand the internet, okay?
[261:37.10]You put Shrek on the screen and have that song playing in the background and everybody pogs their pants and +2, holy shit, the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
[261:45.23]You just sing the song and you're an asshole and, like, let's, like, put his head in the guillotine.
[261:54.50]It's like they both have to be combined for that to work, I guess.
[262:00.64]Bunch of clam soups.
[262:01.44]Alright.
[262:03.00]Complete payment.
[262:03.56]We're going to fridge this shit up.
[262:04.36]POG needs to be banned.
[262:12.42]Why?
[262:12.60]Why do you want to ban POG?
[262:17.48]We haven't even clicked on the deep web app.
[262:22.21]By the way, if you see an app that says the deep web app, don't click it.
[262:27.27]It's not really the deep web.
[262:34.02]This website is built on a blockchain that cannot be followed.
[262:37.44]It cannot be followed, but every move you make leaves a new trace.
[262:39.90]Please pay attention to your steps.
[262:49.31]You cannot sell online for security reasons.
[262:50.79]You can get a minor device.
[262:51.95]Okay.
[262:52.83]Backdoor hack.
[262:55.45]After the hacking attack, if you have backdoor hacking, you can hack the person who hacked you.
[262:59.59]What?
[263:03.68]Wait, we can finally get our revenge on Luke the hacker?
[263:06.31]Okay.
[263:10.95]I need to get some BTC.
[263:13.39]There's too much to do in this game.
[263:14.59]I have to focus on one thing at a time.
[263:15.93]This is like the ADHD nightmare game.
[263:18.44]Alright, perfect.
[263:25.80]This is a soda.
[263:27.17]Drink it up.

[264:30.77]Don't worry.
[264:31.21]I'm going to make sure that the stream that I do, I'm going to be fully washed and fully bathroomed.

[264:43.72]Alright.

[266:10.54]No way.
[266:10.92]Yeah, ASMR gave way more money.
[266:12.10]We'd do ASMR for like four hours.
[266:15.82]Just turn the volume.
[266:16.82]Guys, it's the biggest money maker.
[266:18.24]Just turn your volume down a little bit.
[266:19.38]Fast net.
[266:22.12]Let's go.
[266:26.60]Turn off the VPN.
[266:28.08]Oh, shit.
[266:36.56]Alright, so this is $20 every four days.
[266:38.75]This is two megabits up.
[266:41.43]This is double what we have now.
[266:46.41]We just do the soup, the big one.
[266:50.47]This is three.
[266:53.29]Alright, it's going to be worth it.
[267:00.38]I'm going to make a bunch of money.
[267:01.36]This is a big one.
[267:03.58]Oh, I have a ton of internet now.
[267:06.92]Okay, OBS.
[267:07.90]Just start the stream.
[267:08.62]I don't even care what it is.
[267:15.29]At least you wait until I'm done with a sentence.
[267:17.49]He never interrupts me.
[267:22.85]Mud F. He always just waits for a sentence break.
[267:30.14]Turn the stream on.
[267:30.92]Okay, OBS.
[267:33.08]Stream settings.

[268:13.90]How's everybody doing?
[268:15.22]How do you like the quality?
[268:16.20]Pretty good, huh?
[268:23.76]There are people in chat who write without using their brain.
[268:28.05]Welcome to life.
[268:30.93]Alright, how do you like it?
[268:32.11]How's the quality?
[268:32.79]What do you think of the shape of the world?

[272:22.46]This is a big deal.
[272:29.28]Okay, is it really good to just grab a bunch of shit on my desk and just knocking it around?
[272:34.30]Just go like... You know, I'd probably be a really good ASMR streamer.
[272:39.52]Think about that.
[272:39.92]I could probably just sit there and be like... I'd make a million dollars in a day.
[273:08.62]Oh, hey, we've got some money.
[273:09.67]Can you say my darling's name?

[275:10.19]I need to hire mods?
[275:14.23]Oh, okay.
[275:23.37]Please change the stream title from Aces Only.
[275:25.93]I don't even own Counter-Strike.
[275:33.92]Okay, we're going to do a 90 second ad every 90 seconds and see what happens.
[275:37.16]No, that's too... That's... Okay, whatever.
[275:39.98]Who cares?
[276:02.22]There.
[276:06.72]Come on, ban me.
[276:09.94]Will I get to see my name pop up here eventually?
[276:12.46]The fuck, I'm supposed to be right here.
[276:17.11]I'm supposed to be right here.
[276:19.73]I'm right here, what the fuck?

[276:58.05]Not bad.
[276:58.37]Alright, nice and hydrated.
[277:04.27]Let's go use the bathroom.
[277:18.63]Just the water.
[277:20.23]Alright.
[277:20.47]Now, wait.
[277:21.01]I have my boost, right?
[277:22.01]Okay.
[277:22.35]I'm ready.
[277:24.05]Same deal.
[277:24.51]What did I say?
[277:24.89]I said I was going to do... I'm going to run a bunch of ads, do ASMR because it kills.
[277:31.06]Okay.
[277:33.20]New title.
[277:34.80]Show cam.
[277:37.66]Start that stream.
[277:39.70]Stream settings.
[277:42.59]God damn it, Luke.
[277:45.08]Luke, one of these days, I'm gonna hit you back hard.
[278:00.17]Okay, we're back.
[278:00.75]Okay, let's run ads.
[278:07.76]Wait, don't run ads yet.
[278:08.78]Wait till there's like a bunch of people here.
[278:14.43]What's my stream look like?
[278:15.25]Okay, I got my full camera pointing at nobody apparently.
[278:20.37]Let's get those triggers going.
[278:31.42]This place is very cold.
[278:35.08]There come the subs.
[278:37.98]23 bucks.
[278:38.78]I love pizza.
[278:40.59]Thanks for the $7.
[278:41.61]Thanks for the sub.
[278:42.21]Thanks for the sub.
[278:43.21]Thanks for the sub.
[278:47.82]Put the music on too.
[278:49.21]Music on an ASMR stream?
[278:50.75]That seems kind of odd, but I... Okay.
[278:58.03]Okay!
[279:17.51]Shaking to the beat.
[279:38.56]I'm so bored.
[279:41.80]I'm just going into a stream and I have the fat guy naked shaking his stomach to the beat of the song and you say that you're bored.
[279:52.97]It's boring?
[279:54.67]Boring!
[279:56.19]I need to run ads.
[280:03.63]Just run them again.
[280:27.52]This guy would puke.
[280:29.58]This guy would fucking puke.
[280:32.66]He'd be like, I can't do it for any much longer, everybody.
[280:39.43]I can only have 5 gain rates before I throw up.
[280:49.57]400 concurred viewers.
[280:55.52]Viewers, wait up!
[280:59.64]Oh, too much!
[281:06.01]Too much!
[281:07.37]Too much!
[281:07.77]Slow down!
[281:08.81]He stabbed it on his stomach!
[281:26.37]OH SHIT!
[281:33.66]How much money did I make?
[281:34.44]$24.
[281:39.60]So much toxicity.
[281:51.61]Funny, funny, cry, cry, cry.
[281:53.87]Subscribed.
[281:59.81]That's it?
[282:02.55]Like, shaking my stomach around to the music?
[282:04.42]Come on, man, really?
[282:07.32]It shouldn't be like that.
[282:21.72]We're doing it again tomorrow.
[282:23.20]We're doing it again tomorrow.
[282:24.60]We're doing it again tomorrow.
[282:25.92]We're doing it again tomorrow.
[282:27.48]We're going to do that again tomorrow, but we're going to go even higher quality.
[282:35.87]I need to go to sleep first.
[282:51.04]Get the turbo?
[282:53.30]You have the better internet route.
[282:54.50]Just get the turbo today.
[282:58.10]What a fucked up stream.
[282:59.55]Okay.
[283:00.55]Eat, and then I'm putting some cash on my wallet.
[283:04.09]So I can go out there and use the toilet.
[283:10.05]Paid taxes.
[283:16.88]I can buy a toilet?
[283:17.94]No!
[283:18.22]Why would I buy a toilet if things are going so well?
[283:21.19]I just need some money on my wallet.
[283:23.29]Just buy a toilet.
[283:24.23]Fine, alright, I'll buy a damn toilet.
[283:28.23]I have 500 bucks.
[283:35.47]Alright, we need to have another song.
[283:38.17]Another, like, shake, juggle, ASMR, tap the stomach stuff.
[283:42.83]People loved that stream.
[283:44.63]That's, like, their favorite stream.
[283:46.94]We're going up to... We're going up to HD quality.
[283:50.94]720p.
[283:51.60]Coming up.
[283:54.09]Full screen camera.
[283:55.51]And we're saving this one.
[283:58.87]And it's going to be 60 FPS.
[283:59.95]120 FPS.
[284:00.41]You're going to be able to see the jiggling stomach.
[284:03.84]Slow motion, the wrinkles and shit.
[284:05.32]How much do I need?
[284:05.84]I need 8700.
[284:10.88]What do I have?
[284:11.36]3?
[284:11.38]I can't do it.
[284:11.74]We can do...
[284:16.27]We're going to have to stay with 60 maybe.
[284:18.99]What's the boost?
[284:23.82]It's 3.
[284:24.54]With the turbo boost it'll be 5.
[284:25.70]Or 6.
[284:27.10]Alright.
[284:31.04]Maybe we're not ready for 60 FPS yet.
[284:33.81]Alright.
[284:36.69]I've got 99% energy.
[284:37.49]I'm ready.
[284:42.71]Wait.
[284:42.99]Don't do it yet.
[284:43.69]I need to go to the bathroom.
[284:44.45]Buy the toilet.
[284:58.94]There.
[285:10.79]This is just what he does.
[285:13.47]And people love it.
[285:19.03]We can run ads too.
[285:19.71]Minimize this.
[285:23.14]That looks okay.
[285:24.08]We'll come back here.
[285:24.74]I need to buy a toilet.
[285:29.42]Hasn't paid bills or taxes in years.
[285:31.16]Just juggles his stomach to the beat naked on Twitch.
[285:34.46]Stop saying Twitch.
[285:35.56]Because it's not Blender.
[285:39.18]I should just put a $500 bet right now on Blackjack and then end the stream.
[285:41.81]Alright, mods.
[285:43.23]Let's see if we can get this.
[285:46.35]Hire a moderator for stream.
[285:48.63]Own number of moderators to be hired.
[285:51.11]One is $5.
[285:51.29]Let's get two.
[286:04.21]$5 to mod.
[286:07.85]That's the salary.
[286:10.44]Change the ban rate.
[286:15.98]Where's my $5?
[286:18.32]Ban rates.
[286:19.66]Ban rates.
[286:21.20]Mod ignores.
[286:23.64]Ban machine.
[286:25.50]Balanced.
[286:28.57]Oh.

[290:15.01]Okay.
[290:16.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[290:23.87]I'm gonna get a little sweaty.
[290:37.75]So, what the hell's happening?
[290:40.31]Somebody's hacking me.
[290:42.51]Hold on everybody, just everybody calm down for just a minute.
[290:46.07]I'm gonna take care of this piece of shit.
[290:48.81]C-W-X-E.
[290:55.77]I blocked his ass.
[290:58.03]We're okay, we're good.
[290:59.79]Where was I?
[291:01.61]Oh, right, sometimes I forget what I do here.
[291:15.19]Hey, do you like zoo-tubers?
[291:17.75]Of course I love zoo-tubers.
[291:19.39]I love them.
[291:20.98]You know, I used to be a zoo-tuber myself.
[291:25.88]Don't forget me in the future.
[291:26.92]I won't, Gasposcope.
[291:31.24]I will not forget you.
[291:32.50]Of course I will.
[291:36.80]Hey, y'all want to see somebody eat something?
[291:40.44]No, I don't have any food in the fridge.
[291:46.69]I'm gonna get some money.
[291:47.35]Let's check out who that was.
[291:49.89]Hey, what do you say we really get this poppin', huh?
[291:53.05]I needed another song.
[291:57.14]Nah, we need something bigger.
[291:58.92]Bigger than that.
[292:29.52]I didn't run ads, shit.
[293:01.53]This dude gets banned.
[293:03.29]This dude gets banned every day.
[293:05.51]He just makes a new account, and he titles his stream the same thing, so everyone knows where to find him.
[293:15.35]Think about that.
[293:16.21]If he titles every single one of his streams, juggles the great, stream number 142 tomorrow, right?
[293:24.29]If he just makes a new account, people know what to look for.
[293:29.45]Upload that VOD.
[293:30.57]Oh, right, right, right.
[293:31.23]Yeah, yeah.
[293:43.80]It'd be copycats.
[293:44.70]You'd find the real thing.
[293:45.66]Alright, publish that video.
[293:48.60]How's it doing?
[293:53.41]I wish we could watch this video.
[293:56.25]Okay, the video is 3 hours and 36 minutes.
[293:59.75]That is a very, very long time to be doing that.
[294:09.24]I'm going to piss.
[294:09.92]I'll be right back.
[294:11.68]Actually, like not in the video game.
[294:13.77]Give me one sec.
[294:30.65]Bye.
[295:58.86]Did you guys say there was a raid?
[296:00.94]Did I miss a raid earlier?
[296:10.06]It was.
[296:14.89]It was a juggles raid.
[296:16.17]Oh, I see.
[296:18.85]Okay.
[296:24.73]Let's get back to this here.
[296:29.86]So that's our video.
[296:31.71]I'm tired.
[296:32.13]He needs to rest.
[296:34.09]Speaking of getting paid, let's see how much money that stream made.
[296:37.27]I didn't, I couldn't even see the stream labs.
[296:38.73]Holy shit.
[296:39.15]Look at this.
[296:40.17]I can't even scroll up far enough.
[296:45.46]26, eight, 10 bucks.
[296:48.56]People love juggles.
[296:49.48]The great, this is awesome.
[296:50.52]How much money might get paid?
[296:52.84]68.
[296:53.12]Let's see though.
[296:59.68]Dude.
[297:00.58]Holy shit.
[297:02.68]Oh, actually, it's alright.
[297:04.56]I thought that was through.
[297:05.76]I thought I, uh, it's alright.
[297:07.64]It's alright.
[297:07.90]I gained a lot of traction.
[297:08.80]I gained a lot of traction.
[297:09.56]I bought a toilet.
[297:10.21]That's right.
[297:11.91]I didn't run any ads.
[297:12.61]Mistake.
[297:25.60]You gotta play some games?
[297:28.96]Juggles is a wholesome streamer.
[297:30.46]He doesn't play ads.
[297:36.74]Yeah, let's take a look at the skilletry.
[297:38.08]I have money.
[297:40.34]And my goodness, there's a toilet finally.
[297:42.04]I don't have to pay anybody anymore.
[298:04.76]Alright.
[298:05.26]Let's get some light in here.
[298:07.90]X. Garbage motivation decreases more slowly.
[298:12.40]I don't know about that.
[298:14.12]I feel like I don't even want that.
[298:18.36]I'm going to get it though.
[298:22.18]Open extra slots in your inventory.
[298:23.90]That's a lot of money.
[298:25.99]Number of miners you can buy and decrease your YouTube video upload limit.
[298:30.75]Did they expect me to have this much money?
[298:34.23]What is this?
[298:40.32]Item transfer and use of inventory items are much faster.
[298:43.64]That's kind of pointless.
[298:45.98]Get a BTC miner.
[298:47.38]I just, I don't need, I need money again.
[298:49.77]I think I got this thing going with the juggles.
[298:54.35]That'd be fucked.
[298:58.57]I need food.
[298:58.97]Let's buy some.
[299:04.49]You know what?
[299:04.87]I also need another hard drive.
[299:10.05]The video made 10 bucks.
[299:11.77]No!
[299:12.45]What?
[299:12.97]reupload it.
[299:14.07]No, reupload it.
[299:15.55]Oh, come on.
[299:16.29]That didn't get paid.
[299:24.51]What a misclick.
[299:26.37]That was one of his best streams.
[299:41.08]Alright, I need to get... What am I buying here?
[299:45.04]I need food.
[299:45.64]I also need something else to do.
[299:46.52]What do I need?
[299:46.88]It keeps talking about how hot it is.
[299:51.74]Hard drive, right.
[299:54.32]Okay, HDD and SSD.
[299:57.03]Something cheap.
[300:00.51]$175 right here, okay.
[300:03.97]I need to buy this.
[300:09.62]Somebody said completing a game lets you delete it from your hard drive.
[300:13.14]I gotta pay bills too.
[300:23.82]Oh, very overdue.
[300:26.33]Very overdue.
[300:30.97]This one's due today.
[300:36.49]We gotta stream today.
[300:37.77]We gotta stream right now.
[300:40.07]We got to stream right now.
[300:42.21]Impromptu stream.
[300:45.73]Let's go.
[300:51.64]Hey, everybody.

[301:21.40]What are you talking about?
[301:22.25]Drop, drop.
[301:23.05]Please fix.
[301:24.09]Fix, fix, what?
[301:26.87]Oh, what the fuck?
[301:31.13]Oh, what the fuck?
[301:33.35]What's going on with the internet?
[301:35.07]I don't know.
[301:36.89]How do I fix this?
[301:38.97]Oh, let me sit down.
[301:40.31]Let me sit down for this.
[301:44.83]I ate two cakes today for this impromptu stream.
[301:50.71]Fixed fix drop.
[301:51.75]Do you hate YouTubers?
[301:53.51]Fucking ban that guy.
[301:54.51]He's annoying.
[301:56.19]All he does.
[301:58.40]How do I fix it though?
[302:00.76]Drop drop drop.
[302:01.64]Hello.
[302:01.96]Is swearing prohibited?
[302:03.56]Shut the fuck up, man.
[302:05.66]Hey, thanks for the money.
[302:08.20]Is it my internet or is it my computer?
[302:10.46]Maybe I need a better computer.
[302:14.72]Alright, well, I'm really sorry, everybody, that this is happening, but the computer, I don't know what's happening here.
[302:21.25]Fucking get out of here.
[302:22.53]I'm going to do what I can, how we normally do, but I can only do so much with the computer.
[302:45.60]Sorry about that.
[302:46.42]I just I'm gonna run a few ads.
[302:50.18]Maybe we'll shake around a little you know, like you guys love that.
[302:55.09]We don't need that much stream power for that.
[302:57.85]I don't think I'm gonna write a couple ads.
[303:00.87]Take a take a minute and see if the internet kind of gets better.
[303:05.42]Oh, shit.
[303:05.84]These are due today.
[303:06.60]Hold on just a minute.
[303:12.79]I'm going to run a few ads, and you'll just support the stream.
[303:15.61]Support, you know, me shaking around.
[303:17.48]I know how everybody is into that.
[303:20.46]I'll see you soon.
[303:21.00]Okay.
[303:24.58]How the fuck am I going to fix this bullshit?
[303:30.70]Hold on.
[303:31.04]I'm going to turn this off.
[303:33.16]No, no.
[303:33.62]I don't want to show that.
[303:34.60]I don't want to show that.
[303:37.93]Fuck.
[303:38.31]Is there any personal information on there?
[303:40.51]I hope not.
[303:41.09]Hold on.
[303:41.39]Turn it.
[303:44.87]I don't know what I did.
[303:46.21]I screwed something up.
[303:51.16]I'll be back tomorrow, though.
[303:52.82]I promise you.
[303:54.00]We'll end it out on a good one.
[303:55.74]Here.
[303:56.96]I'll see you guys.

[304:00.70]This is... Fucking God damn it, man.
[304:03.69]I am starving.
[304:06.95]Fucking dumb, stupid-ass fucking stream.
[304:12.23]Drop frame, stream closed.
[304:17.18]You know how much I fucking ate today to do this and how much I had to get this ready.
[304:20.34]Everyone's expecting me to be here.
[304:21.87]Now looking over at the chat.
[304:26.99]Yeah, great.
[304:28.15]What the fuck?
[304:28.65]What the fuck?
[304:29.45]Professional streamer.
[304:30.53]Professional streamer, huh?
[304:33.93]If only they fucking knew.
[304:36.47]I'm upset too.
[304:37.41]They don't think I'm mad about this too.
[304:41.32]Well, I did it.
[304:44.18]I prepared for it.
[304:45.12]So I'm going to fucking do it.
[305:23.66]You like that one, God?
[305:26.97]Fix my fucking internet tomorrow, or I'll be pissed.
[305:42.34]We haven't ran a virus game in like four hours.
[305:53.43]Jerome is using this stream to test the slime guy bit.
[306:01.09]What?
[306:01.23]I thought that was me doing that again.
[306:09.72]It's going up.
[306:12.28]There's so many viruses.
[306:13.60]I have to pay my bills, dude.
[306:27.56]120 bucks?
[306:29.60]I didn't get any money from that stream?
[306:31.18]Of course I did.
[306:31.93]Okay, 123 bucks.
[306:35.53]Thank you.
[306:35.99]They supported him.
[306:37.73]They know he's got to pay his bills and I know he shakes around for their entertainment.
[306:40.97]500 fucking viruses.
[307:01.85]Look at him.
[307:05.37]Look at him.
[307:05.95]Look at him.
[307:09.07]Found him.
[307:10.67]Who is this guy eating cheeseburgers?
[307:12.85]Why does he have full cheeseburgers with the buns?
[307:16.55]On the grill with the buns.
[307:23.57]I feel like that's not good.
[307:24.63]I feel like that's not going to be very good.
[307:31.79]That's Randy from the trailer park, boys.
[307:34.91]Okay.
[307:50.10]That was the wrong link?
[307:52.18]What is going on here?
[307:55.06]What the hell is this?
[307:56.76]Did you make this?
[307:59.49]What is that image?
[308:04.02]Okay, I got all the viruses are gone.
[308:07.02]Now I gotta pay bills.
[308:08.46]What happens if you just don't pay them?
[308:15.55]Expected earnings.
[308:16.99]386 bucks.
[308:19.13]Payments are coming out tomorrow morning.
[308:22.73]Apply for partner.
[308:23.47]Come on.
[308:24.03]I had it.
[308:24.41]Look, I got 137 subs.
[308:28.93]44 bucks from ads.
[308:35.72]165 live viewers concurrently, come on.
[308:39.46]You need a thousand followers?
[308:40.76]What's up with that?
[308:42.60]There were 500 people here on stream.
[308:45.32]I bring in the numbers.
[308:53.85]They can't get enough of that.
[308:56.09]They want 400 concurrent.
[308:56.79]Fine.
[309:04.86]Buy some food.
[309:11.86]800 follower Andy.
[309:12.96]Let's buy a bunch of burritos.
[309:16.10]They're the most filling.
[309:22.99]Upload that stream.
[309:23.87]That's a good idea.
[309:28.93]Back to Zootube.
[309:37.86]Go on fucking Zornhub or Riot.
[309:39.57]You're gonna have to Riot.
[309:43.71]I'm afraid of seeing like a naked lady on it or something.
[309:46.13]$50 burritos?
[309:57.22]Well, $50 is in... I'm right there.
[310:08.17]Burrito delivery, thank you.
[310:10.89]Zero energy.
[310:18.88]Twitch mod said do it.
[310:22.92]It did?
[310:23.18]Hold on.
[310:34.91]They did.
[310:35.35]Wait, wait, what do you mean a Twitch mod?
[310:38.33]You mean one of my mods?
[310:39.91]Or do you mean a Twitch, like, staff member?
[310:46.42]Staff said it.
[310:49.00]Wait a minute.
[310:50.32]I want to confirm this.
[310:51.32]Twitch staff just told me to do this.
[310:55.28]I didn't see it.
[311:04.18]Yep, Zornhub time.
[311:05.84]Okay, I just got confirmation from Twitch staff to go to Zornhub.
[311:09.72]Okay, I'm telling you.
[311:11.46]I just saw it.
[311:12.00]I hope you didn't get hacked.
[311:24.37]What is this?
[311:24.96]Is this my character?
[311:42.71]um this is just like drawings of people this is why how is this zorn hub
[312:06.89]This is just, this is just like the cast.
[312:10.45]This is like a Wikipedia page for any anime you could probably come up with.
[312:16.95]Okay.
[312:19.13]Okay.
[312:21.60]Click one.
[312:22.12]I just did.
[312:26.58]Keep going.
[312:30.98]Keep going.
[312:32.20]I'm so tired.
[312:33.40]I need to rest.
[312:41.79]We did get confirmation from Twitch staff that, like, I could do this.
[312:50.15]I'm not playing the fire anymore.
[312:51.41]I'm not holding a lighter up to my hand and going, Ow!
[312:54.25]Ow!
[312:56.27]I'm not doing that shit.
[312:58.72]I'm not holding my hand up to a lighter.
[313:01.00]Just don't see if it hurts.
[313:03.10]That was 50 bucks.
[313:04.22]Great.
[313:04.50]Now I can't eat tomorrow.
[313:07.88]BoxBox said it was okay.
[313:11.48]Did he?
[313:14.86]He hates anime.
[313:15.96]No, I just, I don't know.
[313:31.83]How many of these are there?

[322:31.11]Okay.
[322:33.27]You didn't think I was going to be here today, did you?
[322:36.83]Probably not a good thing to have right now.
[322:38.39]Probably not a very good thing to have right now.
[322:40.29]Probably a very bad thing to do right now on the Zornhub stream.
[322:44.77]Okay.
[322:47.09]Probably not a great thing to do.
[322:53.41]Let's run a couple of ads.
[323:00.39]Quick before the stream turns off, run five minutes of ads.
[323:07.13]No!

[324:06.29]Yeah, I know.
[324:07.03]Can I do anything?
[324:07.59]Can I do something different?
[324:08.49]Can I do some variety?
[324:09.35]I'm not allowed to do any variety.
[324:11.65]You want me to just shake my stomach into the camera when I can't play Fortnite for an afternoon?
[324:23.70]Say shpee.
[324:28.62]Oh, damn.
[324:29.04]Alright.

[325:53.49]There it is.
[325:54.81]Awesome.
[325:57.19]And I'm going to do the super internet boost so I can download it faster.

[326:49.98]Okay, we're going to get Counter-Strike on D. Get that Super Boost Internet shit.
[327:02.65]When do I get paid from Twitch?
[327:05.09]Stop saying Twitch.
[327:08.24]Guys, I haven't left my house in a couple of months, I'm realizing.
[327:12.53]When was the last time we drove the car?
[327:24.26]Making bank, though, yeah.
[327:26.46]Doing pretty good.
[327:35.40]I don't even know where the car is.
[327:36.54]It's in the city somewhere.
[327:37.56]Isn't it parked in the city somewhere?
[327:39.42]Out of gas?
[327:41.12]It's still in the other town.
[327:42.09]Yeah, I took an Uber back here.
[327:43.53]It's still in the city.
[327:49.45]It's too bad the Tinder thing doesn't work.
[327:51.13]That'd be really funny.
[327:58.25]Oof.
[327:59.59]I haven't gone to work in probably three months.
[328:02.42]I've ended up being fired.
[328:11.70]I just want to play it.
[328:12.72]I just want to see what it's like.
[328:17.76]Yeah, you can drive in this game.
[328:19.42]It's a fully functioning car.
[328:27.64]Almost done.
[328:35.82]So, I'm still interested in this game.
[328:37.80]I'm still having fun.
[328:40.81]Tomorrow we have kind of a fuckface stream.
[328:44.26]Probably going to play this again.
[328:45.12]I feel like there's at least another little bit of content left to do.
[328:54.00]Tomorrow we're doing cartoon personality quizzes.
[328:59.00]I've Mind.
[329:00.48]Which is a community made game.

[338:37.80]Not the one in the game.
[338:38.76]Alright.
[338:50.29]Graphics cards.
[338:54.89]These are cheap.
[338:57.03]Zadeon HD 770.
[338:58.46]What do I have right now?
[339:02.40]What's in there?
[339:08.67]Okay.
[339:09.37]It's the MTX 950.
[339:13.23]That thing's junk.
[339:17.22]Alright.
[339:17.38]I'm going to upgrade the fuck out of this.
[339:18.40]That's junk.
[339:20.62]That's junk.
[339:33.13]Do scratch tickets.
[339:35.16]They're expensive, though.
[339:36.66]They're like 50 bucks.
[339:41.58]Alright, this is a 990.
[339:45.96]Oh, that's the one I have.
[339:47.94]ZRX 400.
[339:48.52]I'm gonna go to sleep and I have money in my bank.
[339:53.18]Yeah, let's go to bed.
[339:54.97]Leave the computer on.
[340:01.69]I need to eat, too.
[340:09.11]Get hacked while sleeping.
[340:17.90]Take out a huge loan and just do scrap.
[340:19.74]I don't want to just blow up the rest of the game.
[340:21.74]Did I get paid?
[340:27.10]No, I didn't get paid yet.
[340:29.62]When are they going to pay me?
[340:30.54]Gamble a loan.
[340:35.01]Do it.
[340:37.88]Guys, I can't save scum.
[340:39.02]Payment will be there tomorrow morning.
[340:41.33]It's going to be 500 bucks.
[340:43.67]And I'm going to do my Counter-Strike stream and then I'm going to turn my stream off.
[340:46.81]I'm going to apply for partner too.
[340:57.98]5,000 followers.
[340:58.38]That's going to take ages.
[341:02.42]Oh yeah, I'll do 144p stream.
[341:13.18]A little dirty, it'll do.
[341:17.68]How does it smell dirty?
[341:18.82]It's soda.
[341:24.18]Well, that's... You're fine.
[341:27.74]Alright, let's go to the bathroom.
[341:35.24]Do voice ASMR.
[341:36.41]ASMR.
[341:39.86]Can I do that?
[341:41.32]Well, I might as well stream.
[341:43.17]What else am I going to do right now?
[341:46.40]ASMR.
[341:46.56]How do I do that?
[342:22.41]Okay.
[346:20.69]See you later, suckers.
[346:25.39]Be lucky if I'm alive again.
[346:26.96]Fuck.
[346:34.16]How much did I get?
[346:34.70]I didn't even claim it.
[346:46.98]Oh, I got it.
[346:48.99]I didn't even burp for them either.
[346:50.31]No add Andy.
[346:52.23]So many people left.
[346:54.37]So, like, I, I, would that, what, four or five hundred concurrent?
[346:59.13]There's only two hundred there.
[347:03.14]People are actually leaving the stream.
[347:04.96]That's so funny.
[347:11.74]I'm not gonna do, what do you mean I'm gonna do that one day?
[347:22.53]What was the joke?
[347:25.07]Fuck you!
[347:25.93]Stop!
[347:26.37]The joke was I wasn't going to talk until I got $100.
[347:36.26]I didn't see any of them.
[347:38.84]I didn't.
[347:39.20]I just lost probably... I kept everything.
[347:42.66]This person doesn't even care.
[347:43.44]Alright, we're buying a graphics card tomorrow and I'm doing a CSGO stream and then I'm going to turn my stream off in real life.
[347:57.14]We're gonna have a lot of money.
[347:58.02]Time for bed.
[348:01.76]Wait, let's get a late night snack.
[348:08.51]Do 144p?
[348:10.71]I will.
[348:12.83]I didn't forget that.
[348:16.87]I'm not even sure I can stream in 144p.
[348:18.35]I don't think you can even do it.
[348:22.85]I'll try.
[348:27.05]Okay.
[348:27.75]Let's buy that graphics card tomorrow morning.
[348:29.55]Go to bed.
[348:30.17]No, order food.
[348:30.75]Alright.
[348:51.74]Goodnight.
[348:52.42]Go to bed.
[348:59.14]No money?
[348:59.60]I'm getting like 500 bucks tomorrow morning.
[349:01.09]Uh, this stuff is trash.
[349:06.45]I gotta get rid of this.
[349:17.11]Am I gonna pay for the card?
[349:18.07]Whoa.
[349:20.27]That was a lot.
[349:21.44]Okay.
[349:22.88]I got it.
[349:23.14]Don't worry.
[349:23.40]I can sell this.
[349:30.65]There's a payment coming in of like 480 bucks tomorrow.
[349:42.98]Lang Syne.
[349:44.10]Alright, store these and put them in the fridge.
[350:01.03]What about the emails?
[350:05.01]What about my emails?
[350:05.78]Looks like you're hearing about your damn emails.
[350:09.48]I'll tell you.
[350:20.56]I just ate one.
[350:22.25]Why did I eat that?
[350:25.81]Burritos only.
[350:26.71]Okay.
[350:26.93]Okay.
[350:41.77]Stop eating them before you put them in the fridge, you fucking dummy.
[350:45.41]What the hell are you doing?
[350:46.25]Alright.
[350:50.63]Sleep.
[350:51.29]Graphics card.
[350:53.16]Boil it.
[351:05.20]Wait.
[351:08.70]Graphics card.
[351:16.79]Oh, my money.
[351:17.23]Alright, let's buy that card, install it.
[351:19.43]718 bucks.
[351:22.69]Hell yeah.
[351:33.71]I mean, if I'm going to be live, I'm going to be here.
[351:35.15]Might as well be live.
[351:37.19]Ordering cards.
[351:37.89]Alright, do I want the... Do I go with the MTX Go?
[351:51.56]How about, yeah, the MTX Go.
[351:59.27]That's the one.
[352:08.15]horrible reviews.
[352:12.14]It's chatting here.
[352:12.68]We're hanging up.
[352:13.70]Yeah.
[352:13.80]I'll play music for you guys.
[352:14.56]Alright.
[352:38.13]Hey, when are you gonna play Exanima?
[352:39.53]Right.
[352:39.99]Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?
[352:42.01]I got kind of absorbed into this game.
[352:44.52]I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.
[352:45.46]I'm getting donations right now?
[353:03.11]The music's loud!
[353:05.09]There are people who say your conversation is boring.
[353:09.55]Ban them.
[353:11.12]What are we doing on money?
[353:23.29]Actually, kind of a lot came in.
[353:25.37]Popular person.
[353:26.18]Say I don't like them.
[353:35.46]I hate all of you, stupid herd.
[353:38.28]You will never be a good streamer.
[353:42.12]I saw the IP address.
[353:43.28]You didn't see... I don't... What IP address?
[353:47.83]Change the subject.
[353:49.09]Talk about cats.
[353:49.91]Talk about shit.
[353:52.21]I do that pretty frequently, so... There's a lot of bans going out.
[353:57.57]Is this kind of... Does this happen in channels?
[354:03.09]There's like 10 people banned a second.
[354:05.53]Does this happen a lot?
[354:10.96]Waiting for that graphics card, man.
[354:12.22]I want it.
[354:19.87]Does that mean I'm a liar?
[354:20.93]Is that the Pinocchio face?
[354:23.89]Can I download any games?
[354:31.90]I think it's Zephyr.
[354:33.30]Ooh, cyber prank.
[354:38.01]Childhood memory.
[354:38.85]I don't know.
[354:41.91]Cyber prank.
[354:42.57]Start download.
[354:43.59]Oh, I don't have a big enough hard drive.
[354:45.07]I can't do it.
[354:45.55]Alright, goodbye.
[354:49.74]Turn the stream off.
[354:50.42]Time for bed.
[354:57.68]And I can't wait for my Counter-Strike stream to end all streams.
[355:03.97]I can't sleep yet.
[355:06.37]What can I do?
[355:10.26]Check emails.
[355:10.94]Alright, fine.

[356:11.63]I got them all.
[356:34.05]Yes!
[356:38.61]No, no 10.
[356:40.21]No 10, no 10, no 10.
[356:42.27]No, I didn't mean to do that!
[356:44.19]There's no 10 under there.
[356:44.91]You don't have blackjack.
[356:47.77]Duh!
[356:49.47]I fucking hate cards.
[356:58.96]I got my graphics card coming in the mail tomorrow.
[357:01.00]I'm happy, even though I lost $250.
[357:15.38]Where's the ASMR?
[357:17.88]There, happy?
[357:20.24]Eat something before bed?
[357:21.04]This before bed?
[357:30.70]I need health.
[357:44.12]Zerk off and then go to bed.
[357:46.34]Zerk off.
[357:49.50]You know, I can say it because it's not even a real word.
[357:52.52]Wasn't there a TV show on TV that got away with that for a while?
[357:59.20]They had swears in the universe.
[358:02.57]So instead of fuck, it was like frack.
[358:07.53]What show was that?
[358:10.51]Firefly.
[358:13.89]Or like, grack!
[358:15.49]Battlestar Galactica.
[358:16.50]Yeah, they had a whole list of like, just swears.
[358:19.72]That they made up.
[358:27.12]So they could say them on TV even though they weren't real.
[358:32.86]And people in the show, if it was like, oh come on, like, grack you.
[358:35.34]It was like, excuse me!
[358:37.36]So it felt real.
[358:38.08]It felt like, holy shit, that was a bad word.
[358:41.70]Here it is.
[358:46.77]Look at this monster.
[358:49.55]Let's get a good look at this guy.
[358:53.61]Prepare.
[358:56.77]It's too big.
[358:58.78]Prepare to dominate.
[359:00.52]The Zadeon HD6450.
[359:02.50]I'm ready to dominate.
[359:06.76]This thing was, what, 500 bucks?
[359:10.08]Throw this thing in the trash where it belongs.
[359:12.46]Wait, I'll sell that to that idiot.
[359:17.07]Let's do it.
[359:17.57]Here we go.
[359:23.56]Two graphics cards?
[359:26.70]Oh.
[359:27.82]Boot it up.
[359:36.07]We're doing SLI.
[359:37.99]Imagine doing SLI with a 1080 and like a GTX 240M mobile card.
[359:46.58]I don't think that would work very well.
[359:52.59]Let's test it out.
[359:56.13]On a strike.
[359:56.59]Hey, guys.
[360:09.48]Guys, we got... Hey, hey.
[360:13.40]New gear.
[360:16.25]Let's check this out.
[360:16.97]New gear.
[360:17.90]I'm ready to play.
[360:18.60]Let's see if I can get that ace.
[360:19.50]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[360:25.32]Last time you saw this, I was playing at 9 FPS.
[360:28.40]Not anymore.
[360:28.86]Look at that loading time.
[360:37.44]It's like cut in half.
[360:44.78]Fight.
[360:48.85]What the fuck?
[360:54.60]15 FPS?
[360:55.54]Where's the bottleneck?
[360:56.50]This is like a $600 graphics card.
[361:03.85]Where's the bottleneck?
[361:08.19]It's the CPU.
[361:09.15]I need a better CPU now.
[361:17.54]Do you see like the four donations I just got?
[361:19.34]That's people spamming me saying, Omega LOL, idiot, doesn't understand computers and bottlenecks.
[361:25.78]I clicked outside the window.
[361:26.70]Got him.
[361:35.19]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[361:36.43]Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind.
[361:39.17]Stunning.
[361:41.45]Stunning.
[361:41.73]Alright, they're down, they're down, they're down, down, down, down, down, down.
[361:47.27]Alright, I'm going banana.
[361:52.45]Maybe a quad box.
[361:53.73]I'm going banana.
[362:02.45]Nobody here.
[362:02.79]People wonder... I don't care.
[362:39.99]Well, that's just the monitor the computer is still on Flush this fucking thing Rage quit.
[362:54.82]Yeah, whatever rage quit.
[362:55.97]That was my first stream.
[362:58.33]You're hacked every day You're hacked every day
[363:03.45]I get hacked every single day.
[363:07.61]When is that guy going to get bored?
[363:08.85]Alright, that's the end of my stream.
[363:20.88]I'll see you guys tomorrow for cartoon character personality quizzes.
[363:25.98]Weird to say that out loud, but I am.
[363:28.56]Hive Mind and Chubby Bunny.
[363:31.22]Let's try to turn the stream down to 144p.
[363:35.57]See what happens.
[363:36.17]I gotta remember to... Okay.
[363:37.47]Please remind me in the offline chat tomorrow to revert this.
[363:49.95]Actually, let me do the... Let me just end the stream and show the credits and everything because this is going to be a joke.
[363:53.96]It's going to have to turn off immediately.
[364:01.19]Please remind me.
[364:03.09]I don't want to have to turn this on and have to turn the stream off tomorrow because I fucked it up.
[364:08.79]But thanks for watching, guys.
[364:11.13]We'll see you tomorrow.
[364:12.47]Starting probably around 2 p.m.
[364:14.25]Pacific.
[364:18.73]This game was surprisingly very fun.
[364:24.18]I thought this was going to be a thing that we did for maybe 40 minutes.
[364:29.76]That was pretty good.
[364:30.62]It was pretty fun.
[364:36.97]Thanks for watching, guys.
[364:38.90]I'll probably play it a little more.
[364:43.32]At least enough to get Partner.
[364:47.36]Not tomorrow, though.
[364:47.98]We'll do that probably later this week.
[364:48.99]Play it tomorrow.
[364:58.33]We've got a plan tomorrow, though, man.
[365:06.58]You're never going to play Mafia 1?
[365:07.54]Those of you that might be a little new to the stream, the limit that is on if I stream a game again is usually about six days.
[365:19.05]If I play a game and I don't play it within six to seven days, you're never going to see it again.
[365:27.73]I've come to terms with that.
[365:33.25]What about Saw?
[365:34.43]Well, hold on.
[365:35.16]The only reason why I played Saw again is because I have Saw 2, and we needed to conclude the first game before we played the second one.
[365:43.38]That's the only reason why I played it again and beat it on stream.
[365:51.22]Yeah, I'll do House Flipper VR.
[365:54.20]We'll do that next week, though.
[365:55.74]I'm not going to do it at launch.
[365:56.62]I thought I was going to.
[366:02.78]It's been seven days.
[366:03.90]I don't think so.
[366:07.26]Thanks to the subs, guys.
[366:08.00]There actually were a lot of community subs.
[366:11.26]And no joking around like in the fake game in the real life here.
[366:16.40]So thank you for those.
[366:19.03]Let me see.
[366:19.71]I want to make sure I didn't miss anything huge before I do this.
[366:29.93]Let me just see.
[366:32.80]And then I'm going to do the 144p thing.
[366:34.00]Okay, hold on.
[366:34.58]What is 144p?
[366:35.80]What bitrate is that?
[366:36.72]144p is what resolution?
[366:37.80]700 bitrate and it's 700 144p.
[366:58.63]It's 256 by 144.
[366:59.66]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[367:01.56]That's going to look terrible.
[367:03.78]256 by 144.
[367:04.52]Okay, you do realize I'm only going to be live doing this for like 30 seconds before I leave.
[367:17.09]And thanks BoxBox for the raid too.
[367:20.01]Make sure I didn't miss that one.
[367:22.71]I'll be right back.
[367:24.19]Hang tight.
[367:24.92]I'm going to come back at 256x144 at 700 bitrate.
[367:27.66]This is going to be stupid.
[367:29.22]I might not even be able to go live.
[367:30.38]256x144.
