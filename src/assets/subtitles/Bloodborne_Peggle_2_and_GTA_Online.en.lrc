[04:15.41]There's a monitor on the floor because who gives a shit?
[04:20.63]Best game of all time.
[04:21.67]Best single player game I've ever played.
[04:23.59]Here it is.
[04:43.65]Oh, Jeremy, you're gonna get hit one fucking time in this playthrough?
[04:46.49]No, not once.
[04:50.74]That was a joke.
[04:51.52]I made that a joke.
[05:04.00]I'm making a fucking funny thing here.
[05:05.64]Hold on.
[05:06.30]Where's the thing?
[05:14.80]You have to die.
[05:15.76]That's how you get the fucking item.
[05:17.01]Give me a break.
[05:17.63]Calm down.
[05:30.78]Tell me I'm bad.
[05:31.68]Come on!
[05:41.85]Alright, if you don't end up, we're gonna get the fucking blunderbuss.
[05:44.13]Just relax, everybody.
[05:45.61]Calm down.
[05:46.05]You're fine.
[05:47.99]Not doing the cane.
[05:48.71]Don't tell me to get the cane.
[05:49.45]We're gonna do the fucking axe.
[05:50.57]So, excuse me.
[06:01.69]Get the cane.
[06:02.27]No, no fucking way.
[06:03.19]No thanks.
[06:10.12]Best game ever made, by the way.
[06:12.68]Let's go kick the shit out of this game.
[06:17.32]Get the new weapon?
[06:18.42]Easy mode?
[06:19.28]Give me a break.
[06:29.09]I'm getting booed.
[06:33.15]This is the best early game weapon.
[06:35.10]Why would I do that?
[06:35.96]You serious?
[06:48.40]Alright, not going to get hit for the rest of the stream.
[06:51.74]Every hit, I do one push-up.
[07:04.15]So many people... I've gotten so many requests to play this game.
[07:24.66]And I'm really sorry that the joke is I'm playing this game.
[07:28.47]But it really... It's a fan.
[07:29.61]It's the best game.
[07:31.63]It's so good.
[07:34.21]What a great fucking video game.
[07:35.83]Seriously.
[07:40.43]Dropping viewers?
[07:41.27]Well, whatever.
[07:41.73]Who cares?
[07:43.29]They went to go watch one of the better Minecraft streams and I don't blame them.
[07:46.21]Why would I blame them for that?
[08:20.98]That won't fucking happen again.
[08:37.09]I'm so... Get that... Get off me, motherfucker.
[08:39.23]Okay, go, go.
[08:41.35]500 viewers gone.
[08:42.59]Don't... Don't block the viewer accounts!
[09:11.94]Leave the cam on?
[09:13.00]Why would I do that?
[09:13.92]I don't want you to see me.
[09:14.80]That was half-assed.
[09:18.89]I mean, it was okay.
[09:30.85]This game has too many shiny fabrics.
[09:35.55]I disagree, but that's okay.
[09:42.54]What the fuck?
[09:48.84]You'll get scared there eventually.
[10:01.27]One push-up every time I get hit?
[10:02.85]Eh, whatever.
[10:03.27]You'll fucking figure it out.
[10:13.68]I fucking targeted him.
[10:15.08]Whatever.

[24:09.86]You're right.
[24:10.84]It is.
[24:14.48]It's pretty fucking, pretty much a joke.
[24:16.74]You're right.

[25:42.91]Why the fuck is WWE 2K19 a fucking Power Ranger?
[25:51.58]I don't see Tekken anywhere.
[26:11.46]Oh, I got it right in time.
[26:25.04]Right in time.
[26:25.84]Okay.
[26:37.69]Where's Tekken?
[26:45.37]I'm not going to play Fortnite.
[26:46.45]Why would I play Fortnite?
[26:52.74]Jesus Christ.
[26:53.44]Okay, fine.
[26:53.90]I'll search it.
[26:55.84]Tekken.
[26:57.40]Search.
[26:58.74]Tekken.
[27:03.25]Tekken 7?
[27:03.93]That gives $50.
[27:07.15]It's $50 fucking... I'm not buying Tekken 7.
[27:11.63]No way.
[27:12.33]Sorry.
[27:12.45]Sorry.
[27:30.46]Everyone's losing their mind.
[27:31.64]I'm not gonna... Preparing update.
[27:38.46]I don't know.
[27:39.16]Guys, I don't know when the internet's gonna turn off.
[27:43.00]It could turn off any second.
[27:44.46]So, I'm not gonna buy a new game right now.
[27:54.97]Here.
[27:58.35]15 minutes till we play GTA.
[28:03.05]I have to update it.
[28:04.54]I know, right?
[28:12.00]It's 50 bucks.
[28:13.07]I can't.
[28:13.57]Is this thing still on?
[28:20.57]Weirdly enough, these things are not on.
[28:22.41]That's not weird, actually.
[28:23.26]It's been like four hours, six hours.
[28:33.33]GTA in 15 minutes.
[28:34.45]Let's go over here.
[28:47.89]I don't know how to play Fortnite.
[28:49.47]Why would I download Fortnite?
[28:58.50]Ugh, Fortnite.
[28:59.26]I can't play Fortnite.
[29:05.70]Fortnite's probably like 50 gigs, guys.
[29:07.66]I can't just download it right now.
[29:09.78]That's not gonna work.
[29:21.27]Fortnite Battle Royale, there it is.
[29:22.79]Oh my god, I'm not going to fucking put my name on Fortnite.
[29:29.61]It's going to take too long.
[29:33.77]It's free?
[29:34.68]I know it's free, but what does that even mean?
[29:39.44]Like, I'm not going to play it.
[29:41.52]Just because it's free, it doesn't mean anything.
[29:43.44]Who cares?
[29:45.86]By the way, there's not enough free space.
[29:50.89]I can't download it.
[29:52.07]We're going back to Peggle.
[30:11.19]Spider-Man's better than Fortnite.
[30:13.51]Goodbye.
[30:14.09]Oh, God.
[30:15.43]I'm sorry, man.
[30:23.49]One of my eyes is lazy?
[30:25.11]No, I'm just, I've just been drinking, dude.
[30:30.41]Come on.
[30:32.57]That's not true.
[30:34.37]I've just been drinking like for the last four hours.
[30:39.14]Lazy fucking, I gotta, fuck me.
[30:48.32]Play Fortnite and I will sub.
[30:49.82]I don't have enough space.
[30:53.80]5,000 to 4,100 viewers.
[30:54.74]Because I was playing Minecraft.
[30:57.22]That's not allowed?
[30:59.78]You can't tell me that it's because I wasn't playing Minecraft.
[31:05.80]I don't have a fucking lazy eye.
[31:12.86]Delete Bloodborne.
[31:14.06]God fucking damn it.
[31:21.63]You happy?
[31:23.68]Wait, what about my saves?
[31:24.58]Are my saves okay?
[31:27.16]What about my saves?
[31:29.94]My saves are fine, right?
[31:38.92]Oh.
[31:39.96]They should be okay, right?
[31:47.67]I fucking... I better win this game of Fortnite, I swear to God.
[32:01.34]My saves are okay.
[32:02.32]That's fine.
[32:02.74]Everyone said it's fine.
[32:10.09]Do I get it?
[32:13.57]Don't.
[32:18.53]No, I got the cloud.
[32:21.64]I have the cloud subscription.
[32:24.98]I have PSN, so...
[32:34.69]Like, why can't I get it?
[32:35.85]Alright, it's good.
[32:38.26]Let's get it.
[33:02.79]oh there we go okay here it comes stop this before it's too late
[33:24.51]If I play Fortnite, it's going to be one round.
[33:27.91]And then I'm... Like, the stream's turning off soon.
[33:31.41]I don't have very much time left.
[33:33.33]We have maybe 40 minutes.
[33:44.27]Comcast is going to turn us off early.
[33:48.15]We're not going until 7 a.m.
[33:50.85]We don't have 14 days.
[33:52.43]That's not how it works.
[33:54.13]I have to pay for it.
[33:55.01]I told them I don't want to pay for it.
[33:56.91]Free ball.
[33:58.91]Those of you that are paying attention.
[34:13.39]Just open baseball card packs.
[34:17.51]That actually would be kind of fun.
[34:28.65]We're good.
[34:32.75]I'll be one of them if I play Fortnite.
[34:37.06]I've never played the Battle Royale.
[34:38.96]Not one second.
[34:41.48]So.
[34:43.62]Does it really matter that much?
[34:51.23]Liar.
[34:54.13]What do you mean liar?
[34:55.13]What are you talking about?
[34:58.20]I've never played it.
[34:58.82]I don't know what it is.
[34:59.80]I've played PUBG.
[35:00.60]That's not Fortnite.
[35:01.90]Fortnite's not PUBG.
[35:08.53]Those are two different games.
[35:15.95]Wait, didn't I do this already?
[35:23.10]You said Battle Royale.
[35:24.34]Oh, whatever.
[35:32.92]Yeah, well, I've played Battle Royale before, but not Fortnite.
[35:41.21]Free ball, that's pretty good.
[35:52.30]Oh yeah, I was referring to Fortnite.
[35:54.88]Not anything else.
[35:55.56]Oh.
[36:02.56]Peggle Royale.
[36:04.78]Go on a political rant.
[36:08.40]Why would I do that right now?
[36:10.20]There's no reason for me to do that.
[36:11.35]What?
[36:14.13]Stop ranting about politics.
[36:15.81]What?
[36:16.45]Why?
[36:16.65]Do I have enough balls?
[36:23.16]Yeah, I do.
[36:23.64]I'm good.
[36:33.79]How much was this?
[36:35.25]Five bucks?
[36:40.61]Ten bucks?
[36:41.35]No.
[36:41.51]It was like six dollars.
[36:43.77]Two dollars.
[36:44.43]Okay, that's fine then.
[36:45.55]That's all good.
[36:47.47]As long as it wasn't more than fucking five dollars.
[36:49.35]You know what I'm saying?

[92:50.17]CPE.
[92:54.33]What's the ultimate goal today?
[92:55.55]To wait until the internet gets turned off.

[93:18.88]Relax, dude.
[93:19.58]Jesus.
[93:25.60]I've been hydrating.
[93:26.26]I'm fine.

[94:37.83]It's not hard to do, Jeremy.
[94:42.64]This way.
[94:43.08]Just get out of my way.
[94:58.82]There it is.
[94:59.36]Straight ahead.
[95:00.22]No, that's him.
[95:01.00]Not me.
[95:03.81]Right here.
[95:12.39]Hand me the controller.
[95:13.55]I would.
[95:13.97]I swear to fucking god.
[95:28.19]Get out of here.
[95:29.39]Don't fuck me over here, man.
[95:31.31]Trying to get to the racing strip.
[95:37.65]You want to do a race.
[95:39.63]Yeah, that's true.
[95:41.29]I do.
[95:47.51]Those taquitos were so good.
[95:55.46]This isn't a race?
[95:59.24]There's no Rockstar Game Services.

[96:32.35]Whoa.
[96:34.51]Whoa.
[97:12.62]I'm still in the game.
[97:13.76]It's fine.
[97:22.23]What a tease.
[97:22.83]Alright, let me see the bits.
[97:25.51]We might actually get turned off here in less than 10 minutes.
[97:31.18]What is it? 1140?
[97:42.83]Pocket Pauling gave $50.
[97:44.15]Thanks for the 50 bucks, Pocket Pauling.
[97:48.24]You know, I had a dream I met you at a Ted Talk you were giving.
[97:51.76]Where's the Ted Talk?
[97:53.92]TikTok.
[97:56.96]They wouldn't let me in there.
[97:59.24]But Pocket Pauling, thanks for $50, dude.
[98:05.80]Do a Ted Talk stream?
[98:06.88]What, like stand over here and do a Ted Talk?

[99:00.56]What do I do for like 15 minutes?
[99:11.44]Give a speech?
[99:13.14]Do a Ted Talk?
[99:15.77]Alright, I gotta give a Ted Talk for the next like 10 minutes.
[99:18.07]Because the stream might actually just turn off.
[99:20.95]Give a Ted Talk.
[99:21.69]Okay.

[101:56.93]What the fuck was that?
[102:02.03]Where did that come from?
[102:13.14]Nothing's on.
[102:13.74]Everything's muted.
[102:43.14]Okay.
[102:44.98]You can hear me now, right?
[102:45.68]1140, 1201 I think is when it's going to turn off.
[102:53.55]Okay, let's get, we got to get the... Ted Talk music.
[103:02.71]Hold on, Ted Talk music.
[103:06.84]Is it music?

[103:41.13]Okay.
[103:51.71]So I've got a couple things to say before the stream turns on.
[104:06.20]So it's been a, it's been, the last couple of years has been quite a rival.
[104:17.04]I went live on Twitch for the first time with a stream scheduled two years ago at this very location.
[104:24.53]And it's been really fun.
[104:27.55]I just wanted everyone to know that I'm extremely grateful if you're happy with me.
[104:50.50]Thanks for ruining everything
[105:33.02]Thank you, everybody, for a nice two years.
[105:37.01]We're on our way out of this place.
[105:39.13]The future, hopefully, is bright.
[105:41.27]I know my mother, but not mother.
[105:43.71]Pretend mother.
[105:44.21]Do I have my pants on?
[105:45.53]Okay, I got pants on.
[105:47.89]Thank you, everybody, for supporting this channel for the last couple of years.
[105:50.19]It means a lot.
[105:52.62]Hopefully, you keep watching.
[105:53.66]Hopefully, you enjoy the future, and I hope you stick around because there's more to see.
[106:00.12]You guys rock.
[106:00.76]Thank you.
[106:05.58]Where's the best man?
[106:06.76]The fucking father of the bride.
[106:07.88]There you go.
[106:14.13]Hope you stick around.
[106:14.77]There's much more to see.
[106:18.61]Are we still going?
[106:22.65]Ten minutes still.
[106:23.37]We got ten minutes.
[106:24.07]I'm not done.
[106:26.76]I'm not done.
[106:28.68]I'm not done.
[106:36.11]stalling stalling for 10 minutes that's right I am I'm going to laugh my ass off ridiculous this is gonna be such a long drawn-out process if at 1201 we're still alive should I go back out the window
[107:02.61]No, that's drastic measures, not yet.
[107:09.16]The mic is a mess.
[107:12.06]Turn off the music.
[107:15.80]What's the song name?
[107:16.90]I don't know.
[107:17.38]Fucking default YouTube royalty-free inspiration music.
[107:24.38]Nine minutes.
[107:28.49]And we're gone.
[107:29.63]Maybe.
[107:32.75]No one has heard you the last 10 minutes.
[107:35.51]Are you kidding me?
[107:36.99]I said so many inspirational things!
[107:48.38]We didn't hear shit.
[107:54.83]Pretty much what I said is, in Las Vegas...
[107:58.99]in Las Vegas there's a lot of streams that are going to be coming I hope you enjoy them there's still like one or two streams left before I actually leave but this is the last stream from here and uh this place does hold a little sentimental value to my heart so it's um it's a pretty big change in my life obviously right
[108:27.83]Am I going to start gambling?
[108:28.71]No.
[108:31.23]I thought you were moving to Utah.
[108:32.87]Utah's not a bad state.
[108:34.55]Eight minutes.
[108:44.94]Where am I going?
[108:45.44]Las Vegas.
[108:45.94]Moving to Vegas.
[108:50.82]Sing us a song.
[108:54.85]call him he's crying silent speech I can see in the Viewfinder that you can clearly fucking hear this so I know you can hear me I could see it we can't how is that I can see it lighting up like a Christmas tree what am I saying
[109:23.79]Can you hear me now?
[109:25.25]Can you hear this now?
[109:27.63]The music's too loud?
[109:28.81]Okay.
[109:32.63]What I was saying... What I was... What I was saying is... Put on the mic that people can fucking hear.
[109:41.44]There's like four minutes left.
[110:53.85]you
[111:35.00]Can you hear me?
[111:36.22]Okay.
[111:37.20]The other mic got stuck in the slot there.
[111:39.78]And I had to pull it really hard.
[111:42.50]So, sorry about that.
[111:43.52]We got five minutes.
[111:44.34]I think.
[111:51.61]It's way, I gotta, this is way too bright.
[111:58.94]There we go, okay.
[112:01.56]Alright, so, what's the music sound like?
[112:09.18]Alright, I'm going to turn this shit off.
[112:12.86]We got a few minutes.
[112:13.50]Why Vegas?
[112:15.00]Because Vegas is in proximity to Los Angeles.
[112:17.36]It's going to be close to a lot of studios, which I'll be using all the time.
[112:21.53]Don't have to pay Los Angeles prices.
[112:23.69]Las Vegas is a lot cheaper.
[112:25.05]24-hour city.
[112:26.85]It's a great place.
[112:27.75]One of my favorite cities in America.
[112:28.83]You can still hear it.
[112:33.23]No, you can't.
[112:36.73]Oh, that's pretty good.
[112:37.27]That's why Vegas.
[112:39.56]Shut off the music, you fuck.
[112:40.78]I just did!
[112:43.76]Knock off L.A.?
[112:44.90]No.
[112:45.30]Vegas is just better.
[112:46.14]In my opinion, Vegas is just better.
[112:57.43]The West belongs to Vegas.
[113:01.59]Sorry.
[113:03.29]Those of you people in L.A.
[113:12.56]True, he's not, that's true, come on.
[113:16.02]Why not New York City?
[113:16.83]Because there's like 70 million people there.
[113:19.83]And it's like five grand a month to have a place that's like a one or two bedroom.
[113:24.13]So, same thing with L.A.
[113:32.21]I love New York City.
[113:33.03]I love LA.
[113:33.61]I think they're great places.
[113:34.91]Wait, look, this is, wait, wait, we only got three minutes before my internet turns off.
[113:38.63]This is turning off.
[113:40.17]I'm not, this is the last stream from this house.
[113:41.95]Did anyone have anything to say?
[113:42.81]Do I have anything to say?
[113:44.31]I have something, I gotta have something I can say, right?
[113:46.61]What do I have to say?
[113:47.29]Um, fuck man.
[113:52.82]This is the last time I'm going to stream in this house.
[113:59.28]For real though.
[114:02.10]This last couple of years from this place, you guys have changed my life.
[114:07.34]I can't thank you enough.
[114:09.88]All the subs, all the bits, all the viewership, it's been fucking incredible.
[114:16.62]Literally, monetarily, socially, you guys have just changed my fucking entire life.
[114:23.97]And I hope you never forget that, which is why I always say things like, sub and give money if you actually think it's worth it.
[114:30.67]Because I hope it is.
[114:32.99]And over the next couple of years, going into the West Coast, hopefully it's more so.
[114:38.33]Hope I can make these streams worth it for you.
[114:42.88]Because that was one of the reasons to leave.
[114:45.80]I want to do more.
[114:48.54]And we fuck around a lot.
[114:49.40]Obviously, like earlier, that was like a last minute thing.
[114:51.18]I just was fucking around.
[114:51.94]Thought it would be fun.
[114:54.96]But actuality, I hope it's worth it.
[115:01.60]thank you for being here thanks for supporting me the last three years on Twitch I came from youtube I was on youtube for five years thank you everybody I wonder when they're gonna pull the plug do a dab okay close enough new year well it's not a new year yet
[115:29.53]But I'm not done until Vegas.
[115:31.45]There's still at least another stream going on.
[115:35.35]I will talk about it again.
[115:38.15]I'm going to, if you're in the Discord, let's make this very clear.
[115:42.77]The green screen stream is guaranteed to happen.
[115:46.89]So in the Discord, I'm going to set up some rules.
[115:52.33]I'm going to try to go live again.
[115:54.87]It's going to be so hard.
[115:55.80]But while we're here, let's talk about this just for a second.
[115:58.08]We've got like one minute.
[116:01.37]If you want to participate in the green screen stream, just head to the Discord.
[116:06.41]Over the next couple of days, I'll be in there.
[116:08.03]I'm going to give some rules and guidelines on how that's going to work.
[116:12.02]Just the general channel, the mods will help me out there.
[116:15.88]Are we still live?
[116:17.08]Is it turned off?
[116:18.38]Midnight.
[116:18.86]Oh, fuck.
[116:51.19]It's midnight.
[116:51.73]We're still alive.
[116:57.57]What is it?
[116:57.99]October 1st?
[117:01.69]It's October 1st right now.
[117:05.79]Time to play Fortnite.
[117:09.81]No, I was told that I don't have a 14-day grace period.
[117:15.58]I was told that it was going to turn off on the 2nd of October 1st.
[117:29.46]Their office isn't open?
[117:31.31]Why was I told that they were turning it off on October 1st?
[117:42.86]The guy told me on the second, the minute turn, we're still here.
[117:54.43]I'm curious about this.
[117:55.13]We're going to stick around for another few minutes.
[118:03.02]I have until 8 a.m.?
[118:04.14]No, no way.
[118:07.00]Oh, wait, no, I'm still live.
[118:08.90]Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
[118:10.34]It's dying, it's dying, it's dying.
[118:11.74]You see that?
[118:13.96]I dropped 600 frames.
[118:20.19]No, it's still here.
[118:29.99]I feel like I said all that stuff and it's like, alright.
[118:34.96]Wait, I guess we're still going.
[118:37.32]Okay.
[118:43.36]We got big bits?
[118:44.32]Holy shit.
[118:45.08]Okay, hold on.
[118:50.71]Oh, we do have big bits.
[118:53.19]BasicFeral, thank you for the $100, BasicFeral.
[118:56.99]Just says, love you, Jeremy.
[118:59.07]Thank you.
[119:01.81]Really appreciate that.
[119:02.41]Thanks a lot. $100.
[119:05.88]The Xfinity website says 45 days.
[119:08.54]No, man, that's not real.
[119:10.99]You have to pay for that.
[119:12.65]I told them to turn it off.
[119:14.61]And I don't want to get billed.
[119:15.93]And they said, well, on the 1st, it's going to be off.
[119:21.54]But thank you, BasicFeral, so much.
[119:26.58]End of day, October 1st.
[119:28.04]That's not what I was told, though.
[119:29.34]That guy lied to me.
[119:35.83]Am I going to get billed because of my streaming?
[119:37.64]What?
[119:40.34]Hold on.
[119:40.88]I'm not going to get billed because this is still on, right?
[119:43.40]No way.
[119:51.26]I have to like, do I have to rip this out of the wall?
[119:57.28]Yeah.
[119:58.10]Okay.
[119:58.40]Somebody said, yeah.
[119:59.35]Wait, why?
[120:06.01]For sure, yes.
[120:07.05]No way.
[120:12.80]Don't trust him?
[120:13.86]They told me it was going to be off today, which was the 30th.
[120:21.98]One person said that?
[120:26.21]Oh my god, Mr. Dr. Helix gave five subs.
[120:28.35]Thank you so much, Helix.
[120:33.91]What if I got rebuilt because I stayed with you?
[120:37.31]That's bullshit.
[120:39.81]That's not going to work.
[120:45.51]30th of like 7?
[120:52.01]Until they turn us off.
[120:56.77]Should I call them?
[121:08.86]Why is it still on?
[121:09.76]I was thinking at midnight it was going to be like... Hold on, let me get some water.
[121:22.78]I'll be right back.
[121:25.06]I'll be right back.
[123:39.28]We're still live.
[123:39.84]I'm gonna look this up.
[123:48.82]When does your internet turn off?
[123:53.90]What?
[123:55.15]Is that right?
[124:11.32]It's not down?
[124:12.08]No, it's not down.
[124:18.38]Gamer posture.
[124:27.04]Okay.
[124:27.40]Hold on.
[124:32.20]You can't even tell my posture.
[124:33.46]Give me a break.
[124:35.48]Alright.
[124:35.83]Where are my bits?
[124:36.59]Let's take a look.
[124:37.19]Somebody said there's some bits that I missed while it's still on.
[124:46.27]Let's take the time, right?
[124:48.85]Lightning Rider gave $50.
[124:50.65]Thank you, Lightning Rider, for 50 bucks.
[124:54.98]And they say, hey, Jerma, you've been a big inspiration for me over the last seven years.
[124:58.56]I just started college at SCAD.
[125:03.00]For one of my first projects, I need to put seven things that I care about will represent me on a 18 by 24 inch sheet of Bristol.
[125:10.90]So I included your logo since you've been a big part of my life.
[125:14.35]I also just realized I gifted all those subs during the week you were leaving, jermaPluto.
[125:20.71]Well, thank you, Lightning Rider, so much.
[125:24.27]Let's take a look.
[125:27.96]The fact that you would put me in seven things that you care about.
[125:31.76]There's the image there.
[125:33.88]Thank you.
[125:37.90]That means a lot.
[125:39.12]Seriously.
[125:41.26]Thank you so much for that.
[125:46.60]And thank you for your 50 fucking dollars, too.
[125:48.52]Your huge amount of money.
[125:57.26]Thank you.
[126:01.08]That's adorable.
[126:01.84]That's great.
[126:06.28]Even being included in that means a lot.
[126:08.71]That's just so... I can't even imagine that being a thing, you know?
[126:14.45]Thank you.
[126:18.77]They don't shut you off like a utility.
[126:20.17]They just charge you a bunch for violating your agreement.
[126:22.25]It's completely legal.
[126:24.40]Thank you for the $5.
[126:25.12]Wait, what?
[126:26.00]What are you talking about?
[126:32.18]No, this is supposed to turn off.
[126:33.70]This is supposed to be turned off.
[126:36.26]I'm not violating any agreement.
[126:44.71]September 30th at 12 o'clock.
[126:49.65]That's fake news?
[126:50.83]Is that fake news?
[126:53.41]Do I believe any of that shit?
[126:57.73]It's not true.
[127:01.67]That's bullshit.
[127:02.43]It's real.
[127:03.15]Don't listen to him.
[127:09.81]Why would it work that way?
[127:10.63]That makes no sense.
[127:16.18]Read the terms.
[127:20.51]You didn't read the GTA Online Terms of Service.
[127:24.91]No, I didn't.
[127:25.63]You're right.
[127:35.12]Read your contract to us?
[127:36.52]I don't know what that is.
[127:41.59]Don't they have to come to your house to shut it off?
[127:43.37]No.
[127:44.81]It just turns off.
[127:53.82]are coming.

[135:00.97]So iPhones, for some crazy fucking reason, you can't run your iPhone.
[135:09.73]You can't run an iPhone out of a wall outlet.
[135:13.45]It has to be at like 7%.
[135:14.23]Vacuum the room.
[135:25.48]Sure thing.
[135:28.74]You want to vacuum the room?
[135:41.54]It's about time.

[142:44.86]I don't even know.
[142:45.66]I don't remember.
[142:46.16]Where's the webcam?
[142:47.42]Alright, we're good.
[142:53.23]Alright, I need a new password.
[143:00.39]I don't care.
[143:01.21]You guys don't know my username, so let's go with 1234567.
[143:21.71]Okay, continue.
[143:25.54]Sorry, we ran into a problem.
[143:27.02]Please give us a minute and then try again.
[144:04.95]Hopper inbound.
[144:08.99]Ladies and gentlemen.
[144:12.11]I'm going to wake up tomorrow with a 30 fucking day bill.
[144:19.91]Thank you all so much for being here.
[144:22.71]Stay on the fucking webcam, buddy.
[144:28.48]Here we go.
[144:32.00]It's been real.
[144:42.13]It's pot, it's burning, it's burning my hands!
[144:44.15]Just kidding.
[144:48.85]I will see you guys very soon.
[144:52.34]Thank you everybody again.
[144:53.28]We kinda have to do this, right?
[145:01.40]It's the only fucking way.
[145:05.26]Everybody that subbed tonight, I don't have it here.
[145:07.24]Because this computer, I fucking can't do it because my life is dumb and I'm an idiot.
[145:13.72]I'll see you guys before I move to Vegas.
[145:18.00]I will see you very soon.
[145:19.62]There's still the green screen stream that's happening this next week.
[145:22.92]And then probably another one on location.
[145:28.77]Have a great night, guys.
[145:30.87]I'm going to wake up with a fucking bill.
[145:37.33]Here we go.
[145:37.61]It's like ripping off a band-aid.
[145:40.21]Just do it.
[146:01.62]Am I gonna get zapped from this?
[146:08.58]It's gonna be like Nintendo 64 like I said the other day.
[146:11.83]Mario's gonna have like fucking four eyes.
[146:34.73]See you soon.
[146:35.09]See you in a couple days.
[146:40.09]This is the lifeblood.
[146:41.31]This is the lifeline.
[146:54.96]Oh, it's hanging by a thread.
[146:56.86]It's hanging by a thread.
[146:57.60]Look at it.
[146:57.88]It's hanging.
[147:09.42]Alright, like, when I pull this out, that is not even plugged in, by the way.
[147:15.88]Just like, just like, blink and blink until you tell me I can't see it.
[147:20.27]Right in the, well, I won't be able to see it either.
[147:23.59]I won't be able to see it either.
[147:24.39]Alright, I want everybody to tell me, no, hold on, I can't, how do I do this?
[147:31.79]Just blink.
