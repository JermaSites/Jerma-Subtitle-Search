[01:51.56]Yep, the settings look good.
[01:53.92]Yep.

[02:33.49]RTX on.
[02:54.98]Is this the game that like we're going to have to spend hours building up a ranch before we see any payoff?
[03:01.37]Yeah.
[03:11.24]Cool.
[03:15.61]It's good that we're doing it last then.
[03:35.30]The customization is not bad though.
[03:56.01]oh my god dude where are you guys hello yeah you're making your character no I was done
[04:30.82]I looked at, like, the category on Twitch.
[04:33.33]I was like, wow, Ranch Simulator is really popular.
[04:35.28]And then I realized that's just us.
[04:38.59]We're just playing it.
[04:40.13]They should give us, I don't know, like a discount.
[04:42.94]You know, so the game isn't like 25 bucks.
[04:55.66]OK, I'm back.
[04:57.11]For some reason, Epic Online Services is updating right now.
[05:01.11]So I'm not in the game yet.
[05:02.75]Epic Online Services.
[05:04.23]OK, so.
[05:08.08]Alright, I'm going to I think we can use like a room code, maybe.
[05:11.06]Let's see.
[05:11.30]I know.
[05:16.26]I think that somebody has a session.
[05:17.52]If you connect, there's a session ID.
[05:21.03]So I imagine somebody makes a game and then there's a session ID that we all put in.
[05:27.27]Be right back.
[05:28.11]Should I host?
[05:28.73]Who wants to host?
[05:31.22]I am just going to do...
[05:32.28]I guess I'm here right now.
[05:34.10]Do you guys want to do forest or desert?
[05:37.31]Forest, probably?
[05:39.09]Ranch and the desert.
[05:40.84]The ranch.
[05:41.82]Desert, it seems to be DLC.
[05:43.40]So it looks like we're doing forest.
[05:45.54]I probably have it already.
[05:53.75]Okay, the name of the ranch is this, okay.
[05:57.75]See if I have an ID for you guys.
[06:05.95]Well, the beard options are not great.
[06:09.15]Oh, there's a...
[06:09.71]Okay, never mind.
[06:13.38]Do you want to skip the tutorial or do the tutorial?
[06:17.84]If you guys can join the session, then we could probably do it.
[06:21.11]Skip.
[06:21.79]What's up?
[06:23.55]It says, if we skip, the old house will be removed, the UTV will be in the garage, a small chicken coop with two chickens and an egg basket will be placed on the ranch.
[06:36.01]You'll also get the axe, the blueprint book, the cheap saw, and the crowbar.
[06:41.10]Are you guys joining off me?
[06:43.05]I'm in your game.
[06:44.07]Oh, okay.

[07:29.68]The same engine.
[07:34.18]Alright.
[07:35.30]Follow the blue icon and read the letter.

[07:53.61]Yeah, Vinny will be in in just a moment.
[07:55.66]I'm making a beautiful guy.
[07:58.64]He's really cool.
[08:00.12]Poke, the game does not like your shirt.
[08:03.03]It keeps on glitching off of your shoulders.
[08:06.01]What do you mean?
[08:07.03]It just looks weird.
[08:07.99]I don't know.
[08:11.16]I think when you move around it doesn't.
[08:14.60]My 5090 is not running this very well.
[08:17.32]I gotta say.
[08:18.34]Oh, it's not happening anymore.
[08:28.61]This guy's pretty cool.
[08:30.67]Can you take a dump in the outhouse?
[08:35.02]Oh boy, I'm excited to play this one.
[08:37.34]Can you take a dump in the outhouse?
[08:39.76]That's a good question to ask.
[08:42.60]I know.
[08:43.59]I know.
[08:46.38]Alright.
[08:49.62]Graphics are nice.
[08:51.55]Those look kind of good.
[08:52.35]Yeah.
[08:56.46]Is there code or just friend list?
[08:58.58]I think you just joined up with me.
[09:00.58]Just checking the vibe.
[09:01.36]Like, this has been fun.
[09:02.29]Like, how are we feeling on this game?
[09:04.81]We haven't even done anything.
[09:05.93]We haven't even had any chickens yet or have gone hunting or anything.
[09:08.50]Relax.
[09:12.04]There just wants to play Battlefield.
[09:16.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:17.74]How do I get in there?
[09:21.71]I love the sprint animation.
[09:22.71]It's great.
[09:27.50]Epic Games.
[09:28.12]I must allow Epic Games before I can join.
[09:33.24]Hey, there you are.

[09:34.77]Yo!
[09:37.03]Vinny at the ranch!

[09:39.87]I see deer in the distance.
[09:42.04]Yo, Vin saw us.
[09:45.51]You look like toothpaste.
[09:48.17]Toothpaste.
[09:52.72]Oh man, we made some real cool guys.
[09:56.31]It was on their teeth.
[09:59.11]That's my lips, dude.
[10:00.91]Whoa, you just exorcist right there.
[10:03.32]Alright, let's go.
[10:03.90]We got to go over here.
[10:06.82]Wait, what's wrong with you?
[10:08.18]Your skin's like...
[10:11.31]I'm a little jaundiced.
[10:15.18]Alright.
[10:16.34]Alright.
[10:16.64]Follow the blue icon and read the letter.
[10:18.02]We just got it.
[10:18.50]I think we've got an inheritance.
[10:19.46]Our farm is now here.
[10:21.92]I noticed I'm green.
[10:23.65]Okay.
[10:23.81]Check.
[10:29.29]Okay.
[10:34.70]This place is kind of run down.
[10:37.18]Where is the letter?
[10:39.27]In here.
[10:43.81]Is there a first person?
[10:44.53]Hello, grandchild.
[10:45.52]If you read this letter, then you agreed to fulfill my last will and come to our family ranch.
[10:53.23]Okay.
[10:54.37]I believe in you.
[10:55.37]So we have a quest log now.
[10:57.89]Yeah.
[10:59.12]Okay.
[11:00.12]Turn the radio on on the wall.
[11:03.14]Gay is your quest.
[11:05.55]Okay.
[11:09.31]Guys, how do you go into first person?
[11:11.13]Hold V.
[11:13.19]Wait, we all sleep in the same tent?
[11:19.54]Wait, I don't know if there's enough room for four people in here.
[11:23.01]Sleeping is already taking place.
[11:27.95]I'd like to watch.
[11:28.76]Okay, this is where you save.
[11:35.87]Turn the radio on.
[11:40.11]I feel like I'm a zombie.
[11:42.71]You do kind of look like a zombie.
[11:44.25]I'm just so happy.
[11:45.87]I'm frolicking.
[11:48.86]So nice to be on the ranch.
[11:51.84]What is going on with this house?
[11:54.08]I'm stuck.
[11:57.93]What?
[11:59.43]Oh, you can go around.
[12:02.74]Wait, what?
[12:03.78]You can't.
[12:04.74]This place is fucked up.
[12:06.06]This place is a fun house.
[12:09.73]There's definitely like mold in here.
[12:12.19]Alright, radio on.
[12:14.99]Find Grandfather's chest in the attic.
[12:24.31]This is the Risen Evil house.
[12:26.27]Demolish?
[12:26.89]You hold tab to go to demolish mode?
[12:28.48]Oh, I demolished some shit.
[12:35.05]You need a crowbar to start demolishing.
[12:40.79]Demolish the highlighted object first.
[12:43.09]Oh, you already did it.
[12:45.26]Holy shit.
[12:50.46]Wow.
[12:52.25]We're really ranching, guys.
[12:53.71]Okay, take the car parts to the body.
[12:57.13]Look at this pose, Rudy.
[12:59.78]Somebody found bullets?
[13:01.18]Take this revolver.
[13:03.04]Get down!
[13:10.69]Dude, you got a gun?
[13:11.51]How come I don't have a gun?
[13:14.42]Wait, where do you get the...
[13:15.52]I don't have a gun either.
[13:17.16]Dude, wait.
[13:18.48]Put your hands up.
[13:20.08]I don't know how to do that.
[13:22.04]Put your hands up.
[13:25.45]Oh my god!
[13:26.17]Oh shit, you killed Jerma.
[13:32.13]No, he's unconscious.
[13:35.32]Why can't you fucking execute each other?
[13:38.16]Aren't we supposed to be on a ranch?
[13:40.66]Where do you get crowbar?
[13:44.23]Who has the defibs?
[13:46.51]Oh, you got it.
[13:47.95]You take out your hand with tab.
[13:54.50]This is fucked up.
[14:00.65]How many bullets do you have?
[14:04.64]Don't waste all the bullets.
[14:06.04]Why did I find the gun before the crowbar?
[14:11.36]We should all have the gun.
[14:12.78]We should all have a gun.
[14:15.87]Wait, we all have a gun?
[14:17.35]In that box right next to where we were going.
[14:20.41]Oh, you do have a gun.
[14:21.65]You know this is going to just be us shooting each other for like an hour, right?
[14:26.32]That's it?
[14:27.40]No.
[14:27.80]That was a very suspicious no.
[14:32.15]This is not a bad shooter.
[14:34.01]I don't have any bullets in my gun.
[14:38.98]Wait, my character's broken now.
[14:43.63]Guys, you already fucking glitched me.
[14:47.01]Do you see this?
[14:50.42]Wait, really?
[14:51.14]Oh, I see this.
[14:53.30]Why are you running like that?
[14:55.81]You know what?
[15:00.05]You guys have fun.
[15:01.42]You just go have fun.
[15:03.18]You're running like such a fucking weirdo.
[15:05.00]What's wrong with you, sir?
[15:06.45]It's if you die while you're sleeping.
[15:08.31]I stayed in the sleep pose.
[15:14.50]He's not bugged for me.
[15:19.32]I need to- I need a second.
[15:20.38]This is fucking stupid.
[15:26.28]Sleeping's already taking place.
[15:27.49]Yo, we bugged the bed.
[15:30.01]Go look at the bed.
[15:32.18]You can't sleep in it.
[15:34.24]Just look at the bed.
[15:35.36]It's in a permanent sleeping state.
[15:37.59]Oh, now I am.
[15:40.25]Why?
[15:40.94]Why?
[15:41.86]No!

[15:48.27]What the fuck is that?
[15:50.11]How do you wrench?
[15:51.01]You have to take your hands up with tabs.
[15:52.65]Why is the gunplay so good?
[15:54.04]The gun, like, this is a whole different game.
[15:56.32]Okay, Vinny, where are you?
[15:57.54]Where's Vinny been?
[15:58.64]I'm doing something.
[16:01.07]He's completing quests!
[16:04.51]Where did you get the crowbar?
[16:05.75]We should shoot him from this house.
[16:09.08]What crowbar?
[16:10.20]We need a crowbar.
[16:14.87]He's driving around in a- Vinny, are you in a car?

[16:19.73]Alright, we gotta go fucking get him.
[16:23.34]I'd like to see you try.
[16:25.88]Is that this game now?
[16:26.66]We just have to kill Vinny.

[19:48.35]You didn't see what happened to that RV?
[19:51.18]I saw it lift.
[19:52.06]I was too far.
[19:53.42]Dude, it was on its front wheels.
[19:55.84]You should be able to ping the fucking map to see.
[19:57.71]Oh, wait.
[19:58.07]I can see where you guys are.
[20:00.63]Hit M. You can see.
[20:05.18]Poke, I see an animal.
[20:06.02]I see a wild animal.
[20:06.78]I don't think we're going to be doing any farming.
[20:10.46]Are you kidding me?
[20:11.89]We got to get to the point where we get a bunch of farms.
[20:15.55]I have no ammo.
[20:16.57]You got to kill it.
[20:18.14]Switch sides.
[20:21.08]It's gone.
[20:21.90]I'm back.
[20:22.22]I got gas if you need it.
[20:24.05]This is making me want to play GTA.
[20:27.43]Oh, there it is.
[20:28.15]There it is.
[20:28.45]There it is.
[20:31.80]Oh, okay.
[20:32.64]Are you just going to shoot it?
[20:39.69]Open the back.
[20:43.80]It's already on the road.
[20:44.54]Can we steal that car?
[20:46.84]You can't, but dude, it glitched.
[20:48.30]You have to see the clip from my perspective.
[20:50.85]The RV flipped.
[20:54.29]It was insane.
[20:57.31]You really need, like, I got to show you the end of the stream.
[20:59.96]It was crazy.
[21:00.84]It was walking on two legs.
[21:04.06]I got to put this in the back.
[21:05.14]We have to complete one quest.
[21:06.51]It's out of gas.
[21:07.89]I got gas right here.
[21:10.05]Did you see that?
[21:11.45]I saw my own head from the inside.
[21:13.58]We got to get to the gas station.
[21:15.80]Why is its mouth wide open?
[21:17.76]The car's out of gas!
[21:19.32]Poke!
[21:19.44]Poke!
[21:19.62]Come here!
[21:20.54]Poke!
[21:21.23]Ster!
[21:21.57]Where?
[21:22.11]Wait, what's going on?
[21:22.67]Look at this deer's mouth!
[21:24.83]Look at the deer's mouth over here.
[21:26.63]Look, look.
[21:27.59]Where are you?
[21:29.46]Right here.
[21:29.94]Do you see it?
[21:31.60]Oh, what the fuck?
[21:32.30]Whoa!
[21:32.62]Oh my god!
[21:36.54]What do we do with this meat?
[21:37.59]What do we do with it?
[21:40.35]I don't know.
[21:41.81]I think we're hard stuck a little bit.
[21:44.92]The car's out of gas.
[21:46.94]There's a gas can in the back.
[21:49.14]The gas can is empty.
[21:51.71]Wait, it's empty?
[21:52.67]We have to just get to the gas station.
[21:53.75]It's 340 meters away.
[21:54.99]We can get there.
[21:56.07]We have no money.
[21:57.81]Let's sell meat.
[21:59.43]We can sell meat.
[22:02.02]Take the gas can.
[22:02.78]We're gonna walk the gas can.
[22:05.14]Can we push the car?
[22:06.90]Wait, why is the car flying?
[22:09.75]is when you press R to flip it.
[22:14.45]Alright, can we sit in the back and push it?
[22:19.16]No, this thing's out of gas.
[22:20.14]This thing is toast.
[22:22.14]Okay, bring the gas can.
[22:23.67]We all have to move together as a unit, alright?
[22:27.55]Oh my god.
[22:32.20]That's kind of working, but that's going to take a long time to go 400 meters.
[22:35.72]Well, we have all night.
[22:37.17]Downhill, though.
[22:39.62]I think we're downhill here.
[22:43.60]Whoa.
[22:45.64]Oh, I'm going.
[22:46.64]He's just shooting animals.
[22:49.25]Yeah, I got some more meat.
[22:52.15]Where am I going?
[22:53.53]There's an indicator on the map to the left.
[22:55.49]See 325?
[22:58.18]That's the gas station.
[23:00.34]Wasn't there an animal vending machine?
[23:04.50]Yeah, in a house up the road to the south.
[23:08.23]Wait a minute.
[23:09.87]How are you guys driving?
[23:11.74]He's running on fumes right now.
[23:14.20]We're pushing him and he's going downhill.
[23:19.17]I think that's it.
[23:19.95]I don't know if we can go any further with this.
[23:23.66]Get the gas can out of the back.
[23:26.68]Alright, just remember where that car is.
[23:29.26]Wait, can we... Maybe we can make one of the other cars push him.
[23:32.51]Flip it.
[23:38.56]Oh god, we're fucked.
[23:39.74]Can we, like, hitch a ride on one of these cars?
[23:43.87]Alright, I got an idea.
[23:45.37]I'm gonna block traffic.
[23:46.31]Everybody get on this yellow car.
[23:48.69]Like, just crouch on it.
[23:51.60]Just like GTA 3.
[23:52.94]Yep.
[23:53.38]And then I'll move out of the way, and he should be able to take us to the gas station.
[23:58.93]I'm doing a little hitchhiking.
[24:02.23]Alright, let's go.
[24:03.04]Good.
[24:03.60]Good idea.
[24:06.22]Why is he stopping?
[24:09.30]You gotta run to the back of the car.
[24:10.56]Did you kill him?
[24:12.70]No, I just wanted him to...
[24:13.79]I wanted to, like, motivate him.
[24:16.13]Alright, we're just hitching a ride to get to the gas station.
[24:18.09]That's all we're trying to do.
[24:20.03]I feel like we're playing a long drive game now.
[24:23.29]This actually is gorgeous.
[24:25.00]This is a beautiful game.
[24:27.12]Why does this game look so good?
[24:29.96]Right?
[24:34.32]Want some meat?
[24:35.33]Should have brought more meat.
[24:37.35]Oh well.
[24:40.35]Alright, almost there.
[24:40.87]Is there a map so we can see where the gas station is?
[24:43.32]Yeah.
[24:45.52]Alright, we made it to the gas station.
[24:46.78]We're just going to fill this tank up, fill the car up.
[24:51.69]Why don't we just rob?
[24:53.53]We all got guns.
[24:55.53]I don't know.
[24:56.15]Maybe be careful with that thing.
[24:58.55]Oh, sorry.
[25:00.90]You just used my shoulder as a stabilizer.
[25:02.66]Alright, here we are.
[25:05.84]Remove the fuel nozzle and insert it into the slot in the car.
[25:09.76]The same only up mechanic we can watch ourselves.
[25:11.59]Oh, fuck.
[25:12.13]Guys, we need to fill the car.
[25:13.25]Okay, hold on.
[25:14.77]Wait, there's gotta be a can.
[25:16.59]There's no one in here.
[25:21.06]How do we take the cap off?
[25:24.70]Start fueling.
[25:27.20]This building is empty.
[25:28.69]Oh my god!
[25:29.41]I thought something happened to me.
[25:30.69]I thought somebody sniped me from somewhere else.
[25:33.17]Yeah, another player joined.
[25:35.69]The hacker?
[25:37.05]Yeah.
[25:38.21]Always.
[25:40.92]I think we need the car.
[25:45.38]There's got to be a can.
[25:46.79]Oh, we should have brought the gas can with us.
[25:48.89]The gas can is here, I think.
[25:51.25]Remove the fuel nozzle and insert it into the...
[25:53.43]Wait, no, no, no, I got it.
[25:56.52]Perfect.
[25:56.84]Okay, cool.

[34:36.21]Place table saw in car.
[34:37.53]Where is it?
[34:39.67]Uh, it's outside.

[35:23.16]Oh, fuck.
[35:26.33]Okay.
[35:27.49]Do we buy the cheap table saw?
[35:29.01]It says to put it in the car, but it's not registering that it's in.
[35:33.87]Let me take out the meat.
[35:35.10]Yeah, take a couple pieces of meat out.
[35:39.95]There we go, okay.
[35:42.89]Now, uh, talk with the seller.

[36:11.30]This is my town.
[36:13.72]I got my shotgun.
[36:23.84]Dude, I think there's probably bears in this game.
[36:25.90]There's, like, mountain lions.
[36:28.48]Wait, what's that?
[36:29.16]Oh, it's just meat, whatever.
[36:30.03]Meat.
[36:34.03]Just old meat.
[36:35.67]If I jump, will I fall off?
[36:38.18]That's a good question.
[36:42.39]Go pretty fast.
[36:43.95]Okay.
[36:44.19]You launch pretty decently.
[36:45.59]This is the general store.
[36:47.48]The cellar.
[36:50.42]Why is the lighting so fucking intense here?
[36:52.26]We're back a few hours.
[36:53.77]It's the car light through the wall.
[36:56.67]It's really weird.
[36:57.89]Oh my god.
[36:59.86]Okay.

[37:22.20]Okay.
[37:23.00]Bring me back.
[37:24.04]Guys, can we buy a cat?
[37:25.05]It's a hundred bucks.

[37:30.41]I'm stuck in this conversation forever.
[37:32.88]Guys, we need this cat.
[37:41.33]I'm dead.
[37:45.06]Once you get revived, I can very quickly get out of this conversation.
[37:49.42]Bring me back.
[37:49.86]I can't revive you.
[37:52.39]Alright, now kill me again.
[37:53.33]I got to catch it right when I can see the mouse.
[37:58.46]Got it.
[37:58.72]Okay, good.
[37:59.54]Bring me back.
[38:00.82]I'm scared of being this many.
[38:03.76]You get stuck there, dude.

[38:53.21]You just, like, fucking grab it by its neck?
[38:56.96]What is going on here?
[38:59.34]What the fuck?
[39:00.24]They don't just sit in here like this, do they?
[39:07.56]Okay, be careful.
[39:08.53]We don't want to hurt the chickens.
[39:10.81]They're walking around!
[39:11.83]They're gonna get loose.
[39:15.72]Somebody's going crazy on the piano, by the way.
[39:18.14]I'm holding the chicken.
[39:20.95]I'm kind of choking it even.
[39:22.11]Alright, are we good?

[39:35.89]Dude, we lost a chicken.
[39:37.03]We lost a chicken.
[39:39.11]Somebody has to hold the other one.
[39:41.36]The box is also sliding around weird.
[39:42.96]Wait, I lost a chicken.
[39:48.77]I lost a chicken.
[39:49.55]I lost a chicken.
[39:50.75]There's a box.
[39:52.97]There's a box.
[39:53.46]There's a box.
[39:55.12]Oh, my God.
[39:57.28]What?
[39:59.91]Wait, no, no, chicken in the box!
[40:00.99]Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me.
[40:02.01]There's a chicken in the box!
[40:03.43]You gotta go back.
[40:04.54]The chicken's in the box?
[40:06.80]What are you talking about?
[40:07.62]No, the saw dropped out the back.
[40:09.10]What the fuck?
[40:09.96]There's one chicken up top here.
[40:11.73]That chicken's fine.
[40:12.63]He wants to be, he likes being there.
[40:14.19]He's okay and he's safe and he's secured.
[40:16.41]Alright, I'm on, I'm on the car now.
[40:18.57]Do we get the box?
[40:19.44]Are we good?
[40:20.60]I got the box.
[40:22.32]What'd you just drop?
[40:23.74]Wait, I... Fuck!
[40:26.74]Fuck!
[40:29.59]I think we need two.
[40:30.51]Okay, two people should have stayed back at the ranch.
[40:34.40]Alright, I'm here.
[40:35.20]Alright, we good?
[40:35.56]This chicken just teleported.
[40:37.08]Oh, fuck.
[40:38.08]The baskets are dropping.
[40:39.10]The boxes are dropping.
[40:40.43]That's my fault.
[40:40.99]Someone close the tailgate.
[40:43.45]I can't because if you try to close the tailgate, you drop stuff.
[40:45.91]Okay.
[40:47.53]I'm just going to hold the box.
[40:48.66]The box has fallen a lot.
[40:49.66]Just hold anything you can hold.
[40:51.00]I'm holding the chicken.
[40:52.20]I'm standing on a chicken and I'm holding a chicken.
[40:53.66]Block the other chicken and make sure we have the eggs and we're good.
[40:55.78]Alright, I'm going to go really slow.
[40:57.03]We're good.
[40:58.19]I'm going to go slow.
[41:00.37]Go fast, we're good.
[41:01.33]Go fast, coward.
[41:04.16]Oh!
[41:04.64]Why are you jumping out?
[41:05.26]I think everything stops being a physics object when you close the tailgate.
[41:08.98]Okay.
[41:09.78]And that's- yep, okay.
[41:11.35]Oh shit!
[41:13.21]Chicken's fine, we're good.
[41:14.41]There goes all the stuff.
[41:16.39]Wait, is the chicken okay?
[41:17.54]Chicken is perfectly fine.
[41:19.26]Yeah, it locks it when the tailgate's closed.
[41:23.72]It's like DayZ, we just started- People who play Storage Hunter, you know this.
[41:27.59]I mean, we're right here.
[41:28.53]Just dry.
[41:29.21]I just... Push me.
[41:30.24]Push me.
[41:32.58]Alright, chickens pulled out when we're on the ranch.
[41:34.48]Put the chickens somewhere on the ranch.
[41:37.13]We need a spot for them.
[41:38.19]Will they run away?
[41:41.69]Lock them in the half of a barn we have.
[41:45.16]Amazing verbiage.
[41:48.48]Okay, I think we should put them over here where the grains are.
[41:59.65]you can't run while you're holding your I put down a chicken um poor food on the point we need bags of grain found it alright and put the two chickens over here and then we need to pour feet we're going to feed them oh look it shows how healthy they are and how much hungry and thirsty is he gonna eat it oh there we go
[42:28.88]Put a full bucket of water in a place accessible to the chicken so that they can drink it.
[42:35.43]Okay.
[42:36.61]Guys, press L. Oh.
[42:40.58]Why do we have headlights?
[42:42.62]I don't know.
[42:44.43]Oh.
[42:46.73]Okay.
[42:50.98]So now we need to get a water tank.
[42:52.98]These are indoor chickens.
[42:55.54]They like to be out here.
[42:57.31]Now pour the bucket of water.
[43:03.00]Should pour it, I think.
[43:05.91]I think we need to fill it with a bucket.
[43:09.69]Did you just kill a chicken?
[43:12.28]You killed them both!
[43:14.13]It turned into a fucking food thing!
[43:16.33]What the hell?
[43:16.91]It's Thanksgiving!
[43:17.89]No!
[43:20.62]Where's the chicken?
[43:23.02]He killed it and it turned into dinner!
[43:25.42]What the fuck?
[43:25.78]That's farming.
[43:27.05]That's the whole process of farming.
[43:29.17]The other one's running!
[43:30.15]The other one's running, dude!
[43:32.01]You fucking scared the other one!
[43:33.82]Don't let it run!
[43:34.70]Don't let it run!
[43:36.08]No!
[43:36.16]Don't!
[43:36.30]Please!
[43:36.46]Grab it by the neck!
[43:40.20]Dude, this thing runs again, the shock collar's going on.
[43:43.16]Oh fuck.
[43:43.68]Small- small coop.
[43:50.83]Why?
[43:53.07]Why is it like this?
[43:57.72]How do we build?
[43:59.72]How- okay, but how do we even cook this?
[44:01.52]It's gonna rot out here.
[44:05.11]You don't know that.
[44:07.25]I don't know, it probably might rot.
[44:09.44]Yo, we need wood planks.
[44:11.00]That's not what I'm holding.
[44:12.37]Please.
[44:12.71]My prize is chicken.
[44:16.25]Where do we get wood, like an axe?
[44:19.52]I had an axe.
[44:20.84]Okay, table saw.
[44:28.78]Okay, we do have one chicken.
[44:33.66]I have an axe.
[44:34.54]Can you guys chop?
[44:35.52]Or no?
[44:35.84]You just one hit the trees?
[44:37.98]I need an axe.
[44:41.00]This guy is fucked up.
[44:42.69]Yo, I just, like, spin.
[44:44.87]Spin.
[44:45.75]After chopping a tree.
[44:48.31]Okay, the table saw... Where did the table... Who placed the table saw?
[44:51.96]Where is it?
[44:53.56]It's right here.
[44:54.90]Okay, because we can cut this.
[44:57.56]Oh, shit.
[45:01.59]Okay.
[45:03.23]Oh.
[45:04.30]Where'd it go?
[45:05.86]I'll go get the table saw.
[45:08.04]We keep doing it.
[45:09.35]We have to place it with right click.
[45:12.97]Does someone have the table saw?
[45:14.67]It's right here.
[45:17.43]I think we have to install it, no?
[45:18.90]How do you install the table saw?
[45:21.56]There's no gas.
[45:22.28]We need gas.
[45:24.48]Fucking hell, we need more gas?
[45:27.94]Fuel tank is empty.
[45:30.15]We still have some gas left, don't we?
[45:32.05]Is our chicken running?
[45:34.09]I put the chicken in the house because it was trying to run.
[45:37.59]Oh my God.
[45:39.55]What?
[45:41.77]Uh, turn on your flashlight and then press tab and go to the hammer.
[45:46.92]Oh, that's how you read a book.
[45:50.80]Oh shit.
[45:54.02]Okay.
[45:55.47]Where's the gas tank?
[45:57.73]Probably on the car.
[45:58.51]No.
[45:59.29]Where's the car?
[46:01.33]Uh,
[46:03.99]Oh, there it is.
[46:06.35]Your head is glowing.
[46:08.35]Why are you glowing?
[46:10.32]Your hair is... That's crazy looking.
[46:12.26]No, but you're like...
[46:13.26]It was blue glowing.
[46:14.04]Oh, me especially?
[46:15.10]Yeah.
[46:16.59]Okay, here we go.
[46:18.19]You could take them on trees in one hit.
[46:20.15]So how do we pick Jerry can?
[46:23.19]How do I fuel it?
[46:25.52]There should be like a green spot to put it.
[46:29.28]Oh, there it is.
[46:32.95]Okay.
[46:34.73]This thing is very dangerous.
[46:39.98]We both start jumping up.
[46:45.41]I don't think it can kill you.
[46:50.82]Yet.
[46:54.20]It's one of those table saws that will stop at your finger.
[46:59.23]Oh, when they do the hot dog test?
[47:01.16]Yeah.
[47:01.98]And I'm like, hot dogs are suspiciously close to another limb on the human.
[47:05.93]We need to build a coop.
[47:07.41]Does that count as a limb?
[47:12.64]Alright.
[47:13.48]Chicken coop.
[47:16.22]Small coop.
[47:17.67]Made me want a hot dog.
[47:20.41]I like hot dogs.
[47:21.87]This actually is a big decision.
[47:23.52]Where's the chicken coop going to be?
[47:24.98]I put the coop right there.
[47:26.08]Oh, you already did?
[47:27.34]Okay.
[47:28.02]It's right here.
[47:28.46]You see it?
[47:29.81]Oh, okay.
[47:31.20]So it says we have to build it if it hasn't been built.
[47:35.54]We're going to need to bring the wood to it, probably.
[47:39.39]Press E to insert, so I inserted two wood.
[47:41.87]So we just got to keep bringing wood.
[47:44.52]It feels like it's been nighttime for like 25 days.
[47:49.06]It really doesn't end.
[47:52.65]Dude, let's get him a second one of these.
[48:02.47]nothing quite like building a coop with the boys I think he's running out of gas let me put the chicken in there even even though we had two chickens at one point I think the other chickens in visit building yeah we just maybe need to buy another chicken soon
[48:34.83]Yeah.
[48:35.31]Remark.
[48:37.80]Gather that wood.
[48:44.90]What?
[48:50.45]One more.
[48:51.61]One more plank.
[48:51.99]Hustle.
[48:52.21]Put my life into pieces.
[48:56.31]I wish I still had bullets.
[48:57.21]Hustle.
[48:57.49]If I had bullets left, you'd be in trouble.
[49:00.48]Go get more wood.
[49:01.64]What are you going to do?
[49:02.90]Shoot me?
[49:03.26]Boy.
[49:04.40]Oh!
[49:05.56]I thought I ducked.
[49:09.12]Double kill.
[49:12.87]I was trying to duck.
[49:15.31]Alright.
[49:16.91]Don't revive him.
[49:17.82]Leave him.
[49:19.76]That's your decision to make.
[49:21.32]Yeah, let him sit there.
[49:23.10]We pressed the trigger at the exact same moment.
[49:26.33]Like, the gunshot was one sound.
[49:28.63]It was amazing.
[49:29.79]Alright, we need one plank and then we're good.
[49:36.53]Chicken coop is done.
[49:38.55]Where's coop?
[49:40.27]Now it's raining.
[49:41.19]Now we have to go to the most.
[49:46.04]I'm out of bullets.
[49:48.86]Uh, we have to.
[49:49.54]Where'd the chicken go?
[49:51.44]Chicken's gone.
[49:53.25]No chicken.
[49:53.77]Oh, it was in the corner.
[49:54.53]It was high.
[49:54.93]It was like doing a Blair Witch thing.
[49:57.57]Dude, how do farmers just skip till morning?
[50:04.14]Also, the saw stays on and uses fuel.
[50:07.84]Uh-oh, you could demolish everything.
[50:09.46]Careful.
[50:10.58]Is the chicken opening the door?
[50:11.62]No, I am, but it's weird because, like, you can...
[50:15.97]The door can close on you.
[50:18.81]Like, watch this.
[50:20.82]Are you going to go in the chicken coop?
[50:23.96]Lock you in there?
[50:24.68]Oh, I don't think you can.
[50:26.44]Alright, so, Poke, you're over there breaking down the house?
[50:32.76]Oh, we gotta break the whole house.
[50:35.04]Yeah, we gotta demolish the whole thing.
[50:42.47]First floor, I guess we just demolish the whole thing.
[50:45.71]If we just break the bottom... Is this a roguelike?
[50:49.26]It's not safe to break the house from the bottom.
[50:52.80]We have to start with the attic.
[50:55.89]Yeah, but it would just break it all down.
[50:58.39]It would be more fun that way, I know.
[51:02.76]Oh my god, the physics, guys.
[51:04.06]The physics are wonderful.
[51:05.28]That's crazy.
[51:07.77]I'm just TPing everywhere.
[51:13.43]The flashlight is like way too intense and nighttime is way too dark.
[51:18.08]Remove this trash now.
[51:19.08]Okay, we gotta demolish this.
[51:25.77]Yeah, if we destroy all the supports, are we just dead?
[51:29.53]It won't let us, I don't think.
[51:38.33]I feel like I'm playing Resident Evil.
[51:48.30]Yeah, the physics get real fucking weird.
[51:53.69]Okay, the first floor is pretty much done.
[51:57.96]Why are we destroying our home?
[51:59.64]I don't know.
[52:09.70]okay I guess there's more to break like the attic we gotta get all of that shit oh that's our quest I think it's making us clear this whole thing out so we have room to build other things yeah there's so much space though oh my god I am teleporting so hard this game is so good
[52:40.28]Alright, I'm going up to the attic.
[52:41.68]I'm gonna finish up the attic.
[52:43.76]First floor is almost done.
[52:49.57]Dude, Red Faction Guerrilla, dude.
[52:52.22]This is what it's all about.
[52:54.02]What else is even down here?
[52:54.98]That was 20 years ago too.
[53:04.55]Did I take out all the windows too?
[53:09.07]highlighted objects first apparently yeah why not just build a second why are we doing this why not just like have a company come and do this why are we doing this by hand with crowbars too why don't we just fucking uber eats this where uber eats a home um we there's not gonna be anything left
[53:34.57]That's what it wants.
[53:35.29]Are we sure this is correct?
[53:37.43]Yeah, it says let's demolish it and start from fresh.
[53:40.20]It says house is fucked.
[53:44.02]This house is beyond repair.
[53:46.59]Let's just fucking set a bomb off.
[53:51.20]Yeah, we're just- this is way too much work for- Dude, who has the fireworks?
[53:56.64]Somebody have fireworks?
[53:57.53]After all of the wood we just cut to make a coop,
[54:00.84]We demolished the whole home and have nothing.
[54:03.48]Why are we doing fireworks now?
[54:04.79]It's morning.
[54:05.95]Do we not buy fireworks?
[54:07.41]I definitely bought one.
[54:10.05]It might be in the car.
[54:12.99]Imagine doing this alone.
[54:19.82]Best game.
[54:24.43]Game needs work.
[54:27.11]Yeah.
[54:27.77]We're doing work.
[54:30.01]This is the work.
[54:32.01]Nice.
[54:33.97]We got 750 bucks for that.
[54:36.60]Goodbye, cat.
[54:38.46]That's the time.
[54:39.32]Nice.
[54:39.64]I think that calls for a celebration.
[54:42.22]Wanna get some brewskis?
[54:47.63]Yeah.
[54:48.77]That's what ranchers call them, right?
[54:50.12]Brewskis.
[54:52.62]Oh, that's loud.
[54:53.78]Nice!
[54:58.45]That was so loud.
[55:01.17]Why do the clouds look so fucking amazing?
[55:05.36]Wait, what the fuck?
[55:07.10]Seriously, just look up and like kind of just enjoy the clouds.
[55:15.67]Are we going to make a new house from one triangle of wood?
[55:20.18]Why would we demolish the old house?
[55:21.42]This is a way worse living arrangement.
[55:25.13]We should make a triangle house like that.
[55:26.99]I would rather cover the other house with duct tape than do this.
[55:29.96]Who put the chicken corpse on top of the...
[55:35.95]This is going to be our gazebo.
[55:37.93]I ended up skipping...
[55:38.91]Anybody get a good screenshot of what the next quest was?
[55:44.60]You're free to do whatever you want, I think it said.
[55:47.02]Okay.
[55:52.41]Where's the feed?
[55:54.05]Do we not have feed for the chicken?
[55:56.19]We have a shitload of planks over here.
[55:58.93]There should be feet on the ground.
[56:01.68]I know, but I removed it by accident.
[56:10.29]What kind of house are we making here?
[56:13.70]A gazebo.
[56:14.20]That's a gazebo.
[56:16.64]We're all going to have a spot in that house?
[56:20.29]We'll have floors.
[56:21.55]Apparently there's a gun store.
[56:24.79]There is a gun store.
[56:26.31]Bye.
[56:27.67]Don't spend all our money yet.
[56:28.91]Give us at least 10 minutes to get a house first because we'll get stopped.
[56:31.94]Where's the car?
[56:33.04]We need income.
[56:35.70]We have the chicken.
[56:38.19]Yeah, you ready to sell three eggs?
[56:39.93]By the way, by the way, a chicken that's not eating because the feed wasn't in the coop.
[56:45.61]And I clicked on the feed to try to put it in the coop and now it's gone.
[56:48.77]So I don't know what the fuck we're supposed to do.
[56:50.62]Okay.
[56:51.64]Sir, if you actually want to do something that would be helpful, go take the can and go to the gas station.
[56:57.29]We need more gas and we need... Chicken feed, I think.
[57:01.98]We need chicken feed.
[57:05.40]What do you mean, what do you mean actually useful?
[57:07.43]Why did we put the house so far?
[57:10.45]I don't know.
[57:13.35]This is so far.
[57:13.93]I just put down some things on the ground.
[57:15.66]I didn't know you guys were actually going to start building it.
[57:18.62]This house sucks.
[57:23.08]We should get another table saw so we could double the wood.
[57:25.19]Look at how many, this is, I feel like I'm in a fucking Willy Wonka house.
[57:28.95]What is all these doors?
[57:32.06]Let's make, guys, we should get more table saws.
[57:35.69]double the wood cutting supply yes we we got money to spend let's go get into town we need some gas yeah but we also need actual income we did make some money from that though we did get some good money from that we got a lot of money has the chicken done anything eggs really no no the chicken's hungry chicken's dying he's a little hungry
[58:04.72]Well, she's a little hungry, right?
[58:06.68]Is that how it works?
[58:08.58]Yeah.
[58:10.13]What if we sell this chicken?
[58:11.33]Can we sell this?
[58:13.59]Imagine walking into a place with a raw fucking chicken.
[58:17.54]Maybe we can sell it.
[58:19.12]It's good.
[58:19.64]Trust me on this one.
[58:22.18]I parsed it.
[58:23.82]Alright.
[58:24.22]Well, let's go to the...
[58:26.19]There's a burger place.
[58:28.21]Where?
[58:29.83]Okay, I can mark on the map.
[58:32.12]Let's go to the burger place.
[58:33.58]Wait, can we sell wood?
[58:36.92]Who do we sell stuff to?
[58:38.96]I'm thinking we sell the chicken to the burger place.
[58:43.30]Everyone needs nuggets.
[58:46.01]True.
[58:47.63]I don't know if we're going to make very much money selling a bunch of logs.
[58:52.14]Wait, guys, you can stack this infinitely.
[58:58.10]Wait, come on, stack this shit, stack this shit.
[59:01.61]We have to, hold on.
[59:03.56]How are you placing it on top?
[59:05.12]Mine's not...
[59:05.69]Right click and then rotate with middle mouse.
[59:20.24]This is a good plan.
[59:23.73]I can't seem to stack any more than what's already there.
[59:30.19]You gotta get height on it.
[59:33.58]wait we can make like a house up there we can make a house on it this is where the real work gets done it's like kingdom hearts and you make your ship oh shit that's okay wait can I jump on this huh now what happens if we drive up the mountain
[60:00.84]Oh, that's interesting.
[60:02.64]I'm just wondering.
[60:03.88]We should put as much as we can first.
[60:05.88]I'm just asking questions.
[60:07.89]No, we should put as much as we can first and then make an explosion.
[60:10.93]Do you want to just cut down every single tree we have near the branch?
[60:15.82]I mean... Scenery ruined.
[60:18.88]This is going to be fucked up.
[60:21.78]Make this really high and drive up.
[60:24.07]Just drive all... Will it fall if it's moved?
[60:32.71]It should be fine if the tailgate's up.
[60:36.70]I'm worried about our chicken.
[60:39.02]I don't know that chicken.
[60:43.40]It's getting hungry.
[60:44.57]It's down to like, you know, 70%.
[60:47.01]We have to feed our friend, our chicken friend.
[60:50.51]Yeah, it's really hungry.
[60:52.37]I don't know why.
[60:52.87]You pick up feed and it just goes away.
[60:54.48]It's just a fucking beard.
[60:57.54]Maybe it's eating it.
[61:03.27]That makes zero sense.
[61:06.18]Not the eating, this, this tower.
[61:10.96]You're gonna have to build a place to jump up higher.
[61:14.97]We'll get some more wood.
[61:16.77]Yeah, we're starting to make stairs.
[61:18.23]Yeah, make the stairs.
[61:18.97]Jump, jump in for me.
[61:20.21]I'll put it up.
[61:21.76]Or you want, everyone take, just get up there and do it.
[61:27.34]Apparently you might have eaten it yourself.
[61:34.21]How do I put this down?
[61:35.69]Just place it?
[61:37.13]Do you want me to rotate it?
[61:38.43]Yeah, hold right click and then when it turns green, there's a little spot you can get.
[61:44.92]Why is Amazing Grace playing?
[61:46.40]I don't know.
[61:46.88]That's how we do it in the ranch, in the country.
[61:52.21]Listen to Amazing Grace.
[61:56.56]Dude, how about we just build this all the way to the hardware store and then we can just run?
[62:02.12]Wait, that's now you're thinking with that noggin you guys have like 40 or 50 hours, maybe more.
[62:09.29]Oh yeah, yeah.
[62:15.22]God, I love video games.
[62:22.33]Look at this little ants, little worker ants working together.
[62:25.01]This is kind of fun.
[62:29.82]I'm having fun doing this.
[62:32.83]Yeah, I'm curious to see what happens when we drive.
[62:37.05]It's gonna be the biggest letdown ever.
[62:39.48]It just drives like normal.
[62:42.34]I like how we have a little system here where we're just extending it out.
[62:48.15]We're not going necessarily taller as much as we're going forward.
[62:52.14]We're making a battering ram.
[62:54.38]Yeah, it's cool.
[62:55.76]We make a big scorpion tail with this, okay.
[62:58.44]Name one other rancher that has this.
[63:00.73]True.
[63:07.83]Kind of looks sick though.
[63:09.41]It does look cool.
[63:11.53]Wrecking a boss arena for... Aya Cthulhu.
[63:18.43]Good one.
[63:23.08]A little too good if you ask me.
[63:25.22]I stole it from chat.
[63:26.06]What if we run out of wood?
[63:27.56]I can tell.
[63:35.86]Can we, somebody said, can we build a house up here on top of this?
[63:40.12]Yeah, can we build structures on top?
[63:44.49]Hmm.
[63:45.65]That's a very, very good question.
[63:47.39]You should try to make a floor and then make a house.
[63:50.33]A mobile house.
[63:51.90]We could have a mobile farm.
[63:55.62]Hmm.
[63:57.32]No, I tried to build a well on top of it, but I can't.
[64:01.61]It needs to be flat though, like enough floor.
[64:03.92]Okay, what if we do this, ready?
[64:05.54]Place logs onto the sides?
[64:07.04]Yeah, try to get them on the sides.
[64:09.17]Yeah.
[64:18.32]Oh, goodness.
[64:19.30]Sorry.
[64:26.77]Trying to get the angle here.
[64:27.95]Yeah, that angle's tough.
[64:30.93]It looks like somebody's trying to build a house.
[64:35.58]I don't know.
[64:37.04]I don't think I think it's still on the ground.
[64:38.78]It's not going to work.
[64:40.65]Are we ready to drive?
[64:44.95]No.
[64:46.91]No.
[64:49.28]No, this has got to go even more.
[64:51.88]Come on.
[64:53.08]When life gives you lemons, you got to make something with it.
[64:59.53]Whatever this is, whatever we're doing.
[65:06.88]When life gives you lemons, do a funny TikTok challenge video where you put it in your mouth and suck on it and go, and see who can last the longest.
[65:17.38]And become like super famous for like 20 minutes.
[65:21.42]Yeah.
[65:25.53]Deal.
[65:26.75]I do still like the forward pattern we have.
[65:34.22]I hope this is dude oh once we actually start to drive this is where it's gonna get either very disappointing like you said Ster or incredible this could be the best day of all of our lives we don't even know it yet what if you're excited I would press one right now this is a lot of I haven't been putting them up here this is a lot of effort
[66:04.54]Jesus when it comes to up a game we're locked in yeah this I've made a career off of it personally I have dude I mean we could drive this up to a hill and then put the wood on the top easier if it drives we could also bring it to the barn it's still holding up it's it works
[66:34.92]cars playing jammers yeah the radio station it goes amazing grace into like chiptune how do we get rid of this structure it's like the base of the structure no idea should we drive it closer to wood
[67:01.01]ah we're not we don't test it yet I don't know it might be scary if we the ignition might turn on and this thing might explode I'm doing it oh god I'm turning it on no don't test it do not do not I don't think we should drive yet no we gotta all be ready for that yeah uh chicken update the chicken is now down to half health half can we put the chicken at the top we gotta get the chicken food why don't we bring the chicken with us like
[67:29.44]Poke said we'll put the chicken up top.
[67:32.61]Oh, you go, you go.
[67:35.19]Alright, I'll go.
[67:36.99]Oh, sorry.
[67:37.37]I didn't know it was you.
[67:46.17]It's another good one.
[67:47.95]Yeah, this is perfect for what we're doing.
[67:53.46]I'm gonna bring wood.
[67:54.54]I'm gonna spam bring wood to the front.
[67:56.37]I can't place the chicken.
[67:57.34]Who's good at jumping up?
[67:58.10]Who's good at jumping up?
[67:59.02]I feel like I'm pretty good at jumping up.
[68:00.48]I think Pokey, you're pretty good at it.
[68:02.92]I can't place the chicken.
[68:04.07]I'll do...
[68:04.87]I'll get wood and put it over here.
[68:07.27]I feel like I can do that better.
[68:09.09]That... Ster?
[68:11.16]What the fuck is that?
[68:13.26]I don't know.
[68:13.62]I'm just trying things.
[68:15.64]Oh, no.
[68:16.29]I think we should all just go up.
[68:17.15]I'll go up.
[68:17.59]I think all of our streams will be fun.
[68:21.17]Your stream will like it to see you go up there.
[68:25.96]Dude, this is... Science experiment.
[68:33.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[68:34.50]You can pick up one of the woods that's like holding the whole wood contraption.
[68:39.29]No, don't do that.
[68:40.53]Let's drive it first, then we do that.
[68:44.35]because if we can get floating wood that would be really cool too but we need to make sure we can drive this first okay we also have to make we got to make it go down a little I think because we need to try to drive them pick them up we're going to try to drive into other cars so that's the thing is I tried placing from the bottom not happening okay yeah I tried uh just kind of on the side but even then it's not so great
[69:16.09]Alright, I'm thinking let's do how you guys feel about... Should we clean it up?
[69:19.74]Should we clean it at the bottom?
[69:22.14]Should we give it a little more support?
[69:23.72]Or just run with it?
[69:27.29]I feel like we can make it easier to get up there.
[69:29.45]Actually, it might break it.
[69:30.21]I don't know.
[69:30.51]I'm just scared to touch it.
[69:31.14]We shouldn't touch it.
[69:31.98]Yeah, maybe we don't want to touch it right this second.
[69:38.37]We feel like a lion.
[69:51.06]I'm pretty sure you won't be going anywhere since you'll be stuck inside that table.
[69:57.33]Huh.
[69:57.43]I think we can remove the table, can't we?
[70:02.41]Yeah, we should get this table out of the way.
[70:06.22]Just imagine that just fucking launched everything.
[70:13.53]Oh my god, what if you press flip car?
[70:15.74]I'm letting the chicken out of here.
[70:18.22]You know what could be good in the future?
[70:19.74]Sons of the Forest.
[70:20.66]I wonder if they updated that a lot.
[70:22.69]Go eat grass or something.
[70:24.73]I played a bunch of that.
[70:25.69]I don't know if I'm down for that.
[70:28.54]Oh yeah?
[70:29.58]The original Forest was the best, man.
[70:34.16]The Forest 1.
[70:34.80]Such a good game.
[70:36.13]I don't even think I played that one.
[70:37.75]Well, you never did?
[70:38.31]No, I just played Sons.
[70:40.99]what maybe we should play that yeah number one is really good poke I remember watching you play that and you put on a cheat or a mod where it filled your backpack with every single item in the whole game I never did that he did no we didn't do that
[71:08.21]That's a tick box you found.
[71:10.61]That was Stardew.
[71:12.35]Oh, it was a Stardew?
[71:14.42]You did that in some game.
[71:16.86]Okay, Jeremiah.
[71:17.56]How much until you're satiated with this?
[71:22.01]Why are you asking me?
[71:23.73]I feel satiated.
[71:25.23]Oh, Starfield.
[71:26.17]Starfield.
[71:28.60]I think it's time, guys.
[71:29.68]I think we did a good job here.
[71:31.52]I think we should do it.
[71:33.02]One more cycle and we're done.
[71:35.77]Right here.
[71:43.56]tower of babel must grow alright I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna stay out of the car who's gonna do the honors of driving I feel like this has a potential to just explode and this should be a wide angle of this let's get cameras in the right spot
[72:13.46]Someone stand on the tip.
[72:16.69]This is a perfect song for this too.
[72:19.19]Yeah, someone stand on the tip, Poke.
[72:21.72]Alright, fine.
[72:22.06]You're there.
[72:23.68]We'll all have good angles of this, so.
[72:28.85]You driving?
[72:29.77]One more, one more.
[72:31.55]I'll drive.
[72:31.97]This is it.
[72:34.36]Everyone bless this log.
[72:35.70]Alright, come on.
[72:37.06]Think of something fun.
[72:41.17]The tailgate?
[72:42.01]The tailgate needs to be put up.
[72:44.92]If we put the tailgate up, won't that fuck up something?
[72:48.24]Not really.
[72:49.72]No, it's good.
[72:50.57]I think we'll drive with the tailgate, and then we'll drive with it down as well.
[72:55.55]I think both would be fun.
[72:57.68]Alright.
[72:58.32]Are you guys ready?
[73:00.30]Hold on.
[73:00.68]I'm almost there.
[73:04.45]Okay.
[73:04.69]You ready, Poke?
[73:06.57]Alright.
[73:08.27]I'm scared.
[73:10.15]Wait.
[73:10.45]Wait.
[73:10.59]Don't drive.
[73:10.86]Ignition on.
[73:11.36]Don't drive.
[73:11.82]I'm raising my FOV.
[73:23.43]Alright.
[73:33.18]Perfect.
[73:35.59]There's no way.
[73:38.41]Grab a log real quick.
[73:39.33]I want to do a test.
[73:39.99]I want to do a test.
[73:41.01]We may have learned something very valuable, but not the thing we were hoping for.
[73:53.05]I'm just sad.
[73:56.71]That's too bad.
[73:59.69]What if you drive into it?
[74:08.16]Wait, what?
[74:09.47]Why is it working there?
[74:10.51]That's weird.
[74:16.21]Something's not right.
[74:17.68]Can we connect them?
[74:21.00]I don't think so.
[74:23.66]Well, you know what?
[74:24.22]Maybe we can.
[74:25.08]Maybe we can.
[74:25.66]Let's see.
[74:26.93]Wait, I can't pick up those at the bottom.
[74:33.69]These are locked.
[74:34.25]I have an idea.
[74:35.93]Hold on, I got one.
[74:38.04]I'm going to drop the ones at the very end.
[74:50.92]Shit.
[74:54.85]What?
[74:57.39]What happened?
[74:58.60]Are they just stuck now?
[75:00.00]No, I just fell.
[75:02.54]Wait, I opened the gate.
[75:03.78]Let's see what happens.
[75:07.55]Oh, no.
[75:08.59]No difference.
[75:09.55]No difference.
[75:11.54]Well, at least we have logs forever.
[75:15.36]Let's try a couple more up top here.
[75:19.97]Just because I'm wondering what the actual limit is.
[75:22.19]This doesn't seem to be a fully defined limit.
[75:24.95]It's not letting me place this.
[75:30.42]Yeah, same actually.
[75:31.52]Maybe that's the limit then, and the car's turned on.
[75:35.20]So how the fuck did we do that before?
[75:36.62]I don't know.
[75:38.79]I don't know how that started, but...
[75:43.85]Wait, you can do there.
[75:44.91]Try now.
[75:48.74]Try driving.
[75:49.80]Okay, because the tailgate was down?
[75:54.09]Can you go higher?
[76:02.35]Yep.
[76:04.09]It's gotta rotate.
[76:08.74]Nope.
[76:10.54]Yeah, too bad.
[76:12.84]Alright, join me up there.
[76:14.12]I'm gonna get all the wood down.
[76:17.89]Oh, .
[76:23.06]Wait, turn the carpet away.
[76:23.90]Man, ranching is awesome.
[76:26.51]One of them is floating still over there.
[76:29.13]Yeah.
[76:31.21]It's hard.
[76:32.09]It's hard to do that.
[76:36.75]Yeah, what is this station?
[76:37.82]This is a banger.
[76:42.40]Ugh.
[76:46.02]Let's also just kind of leave him for now.
[76:47.66]Come back to it.
[76:48.20]We got to feed our chicken.
[76:49.07]Our chicken's going to die.
[76:49.99]I let the chicken free.
[76:51.15]Felt like that was the most...
[76:54.53]Oh, wait, he didn't want to go anywhere.
[76:56.82]He's okay.
[76:57.08]Still hungry.
[76:57.76]He's alright, though.
[76:59.86]Food down to 25%.
[77:02.47]Oh!
[77:03.17]He gives... She gives an egg!
[77:05.33]I got an egg!
[77:07.45]Hell yeah, let's sell it.
[77:08.94]We got one egg in that basket.
[77:13.04]Yeah, how do you sell stuff?
[77:15.51]I don't know.
[77:16.01]Alright, we're gonna sell this one egg.
[77:22.93]Get all this shit out of the car.
[77:29.50]No, this is good, because we stand on the logs, and that'll be like, we can just, you know, use that as transportation.
[77:38.13]You sell it in town where you buy the chicken food.
[77:41.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:45.98]Oh, oops.
[77:46.26]Dom, we need to get in.
[77:47.88]What if you made the top part flat?
[77:50.53]Like, you don't have to go up.
[77:52.01]What if we went sideways?
[77:55.05]It doesn't really let you place it.
[77:57.39]We have half a tank of gas.
[78:01.28]Just a fair warning.
[78:06.32]If we sell the egg, we'll be rich.
[78:08.89]Alright, we're going to Best Burger.
[78:12.53]Then we're going to go to the general store to sell the stuff we got.
[78:17.70]Go to the burger place.
[78:19.66]We'll see you later.
[78:23.09]Damn it.
[78:26.40]Can you stand on the log on top?
[78:29.94]Go ahead.
[78:31.82]We should go drive up the mountain.
[78:33.75]Yeah.
[78:34.53]You wanna drive up the mountain?
[78:35.45]I think that's a great idea.
[78:38.05]Let's do the dropout and drive up the mountain.
[78:47.08]Oh.
[78:47.16]The music just cut out.
[78:50.25]we can probably make an enclosure and like trap ourselves but whatever let's go get some burgers the piano's getting weird
[79:14.12]Vinny, stop playing around.
[79:15.38]I'm in.
[79:17.23]I'm good.
[79:19.09]Alright.
[79:19.39]We got to go sell some stuff and go eat some burgers.
[79:32.62]Kind of foggy out, guys.
[79:34.32]It is foggy.
[79:35.48]It kind of looks like Silent Hill a little bit.
[79:39.23]I'm kind of wearing the jacket.
[79:40.55]What is that?
[79:40.97]Is that a dog?
[79:42.78]The wolf.
[79:43.46]Was it a wolf?
[79:44.04]It is a wolf.
[79:47.18]Gone.
[79:48.84]Um... Be careful out there.
[79:50.49]It's hitting you!
[79:50.99]It's hitting you!
[79:51.73]Ah!
[79:52.97]Ah!
[79:53.05]Shoot him!
[79:54.05]Shit, that was my last bullet!
[79:56.47]Get him!
[79:56.73]Somebody kill him!
[79:58.56]Ow!
[80:03.38]Alright, let's eat a burger.
[80:05.58]Best burger.
[80:06.20]You ever go to Best Burger?
[80:07.44]Oh my god, the best.
[80:09.85]No, I had a burger in Lebanon.
[80:12.95]extra meat oh I order here 65 cent burger are you kidding me what year is it this is I don't have any items here I can buy can you get me the burger can you give me a number one empty I got nothing I don't think we have what the hell yeah this place is fake
[80:37.45]This is like a Truman Show.
[80:39.39]It's a ghost kitchen.
[80:40.68]Do you know when Jim Carrey goes into a random place in the Truman Show?
[80:44.18]Wait, look at this.
[80:45.62]Eggs are up, man.
[80:47.63]Dude, eggs are down.
[80:48.63]What are you talking about?
[80:49.95]Dude, bell peppers are up crazy.

[82:56.63]Wait, I was not on it?
[82:58.03]I think you fell off.
[82:58.89]Oh my, this song is sick.
[83:01.65]Oh.
[83:02.25]Oh, I'm off.
[83:04.42]Dude, I fell off.
[83:05.72]Learn to drive.
[83:06.76]How are we even going to get down there?
[83:10.06]There's no road.
[83:10.84]Dude, this music.
[83:12.05]This is farm music.
[83:17.87]There's no road where we're going, apparently.
[83:22.10]We might have to...
[83:22.98]I think I got to go off-road in a minute, yeah.
[83:25.88]The dev tried to, like, fucking slide his Apple Studio song in the game.
[83:30.25]I don't even hear any music.
[83:32.31]You don't get the radio on?
[83:33.64]Oh, shit.
[83:39.27]I do.
[83:39.71]I don't.
[83:40.01]I just don't.
[83:41.21]I heard it a moment ago.
[83:42.82]Now I hear it.
[83:43.94]Wait, that's you, Poke.
[83:49.37]Wait, is that?
[83:51.03]God damn it, guys.
[83:51.67]I fell off again.
[83:52.43]This song is a vibe.
[83:55.77]We're almost out of gas.
[83:58.58]If you don't talk about it, it doesn't happen.
[84:01.44]This is a good song to put on.
[84:06.33]the devs put like voice detection in this game and if you say gas it lowers it I I think we're getting off anyways we we're gonna we're gonna walk from here there's no road remember where the car is can I bring it up there remember where the car is drives it up a mountain I just didn't know if I could make it up here we're never getting that back I'm I'm in it oh you can't even walk up here yeah you're gonna run out of gas up there
[84:37.25]You guys can't walk up there.
[84:38.19]I think we're OK as long as I'm careful with it.
[84:47.36]Well, there's a there's a path over here.
[84:48.98]Dude, whoever's flashlight is on.
[84:50.34]I can't see shit.
[84:52.67]Alright, it's off.
[84:56.65]Ah.
[84:59.33]Already in.
[85:06.68]Oh, goodness.
[85:13.46]What the fuck?
[85:14.49]Where is this place?
[85:17.31]I think it's all the way up the top.
[85:22.14]It's okay.
[85:22.36]It's alright.
[85:23.40]I got the brake on.
[85:23.90]It would be a bad time to run out of gas.
[85:26.76]It would be very bad.
[85:27.70]I don't think I can drive up.
[85:28.70]Yes, I can.
[85:29.20]Okay.
[85:33.61]Is it all the way at the very top?
[85:36.55]Yep.
[85:37.95]I see it.
[85:40.31]I can't drive up that.
[85:42.44]It's up here.
[85:46.35]Alright, I'm parking the car.
[85:47.15]The fuck is the intended method of getting up here?
[85:50.60]God, I can't stop.
[85:54.13]Okay, I parked the car.
[86:02.80]um fucking snuff I don't think he sells anything he just gave quests yeah how do we make a gun we might have to go to like the general store maybe it was on the list for ammo howdy friend goodbye that's all he says
[86:24.15]I guess because we already took the quests.
[86:26.93]Yikes, dude.
[86:28.41]This looks like the Minecraft mod video where you can see everything.
[86:32.54]The general store is not far.
[86:35.66]The general store is close.
[86:38.28]You can see so far.
[86:40.13]It's kind of amazing.
[86:41.61]And the game runs really pretty good.
[86:44.17]Oh my god.
[86:45.69]This is actually impressive.
[86:49.35]Unironically impressive.
[86:56.11]Alright, we're gonna... Is this an ad?
[86:59.74]No.
[87:06.30]A lot of rocks here, Poke.
[87:10.05]Oh no, not the egg.
[87:11.07]I can't stop.
[87:15.74]There we go.
[87:24.06]The Hurseen quest is nearby, just get to fall quick.
[87:26.22]Oh my god.
[87:28.16]That was almost crazy.
[87:29.68]That would have been awesome.
[87:30.84]They're closed because it's too early.
[87:33.53]Can we sleep on the ground in front?
[87:40.01]What time is it?
[87:42.24]What if we glitch inside?
[87:48.20]I'm in.
[87:48.61]Oh, we're in.
[87:50.27]Yeah.
[87:51.93]Okay.
[87:53.36]What do we got here?
[87:54.08]Tools.
[88:00.89]No.
[88:01.85]A stunner.
[88:03.77]We probably should buy food for our chicken.
[88:06.12]Yes.
[88:08.24]Pet food?
[88:08.78]I'm going to buy another chicken, too.
[88:13.33]Can we buy a cat?
[88:14.33]Can we buy bullets?
[88:15.50]Yeah, we should buy a cat.
[88:19.22]We can buy bullets.
[88:20.80]Can we buy an orange cat, please?
[88:22.98]It's about $200 worth of bullets.
[88:26.71]Wait, where?
[88:27.71]I just bought them.
[88:28.21]I got them.
[88:29.73]Oh, I see them.
[88:30.43]Yeah.
[88:35.82]I bought the cat.
[88:36.34]Listen, guys, I don't like the connotations of us buying bullets and a cat.
[88:41.50]So just be careful is what I'm going to say.
[88:44.27]Just as much as possible, be careful.
[88:47.15]I'm carrying the cat.
[88:48.23]Protect that cat with your life.
[88:58.86]No!
[88:59.18]Put it down.
[89:02.25]Put it down.
[89:05.39]He's trying to...
[89:07.79]I...
[89:08.40]He's trying to kill...
[89:09.70]The cat's getting away.
[89:10.78]We need food.
[89:11.78]We need cat food.
[89:12.26]We need pet food.
[89:15.77]Stop.
[89:16.29]Stop.
[89:18.43]Why did we give him bullets?
[89:20.34]There's no reason to give him bullets.
[89:22.74]Look at this.
[89:23.02]Look at this.
[89:23.56]If you go to the cat... Look at the cat's face.
[89:25.96]Look at the cat's face.
[89:27.18]If you look at the cat, and then you... No!
[89:34.85]Whoa, I went to main menu.
[89:39.16]It was the worst idea to go get bullets.
[89:42.24]Why did we do that?
[89:44.69]Is anybody alive?
[89:47.38]I went to the cat.
[89:48.60]I think the cat got away.
[89:50.92]Wait, where's the cat?
[89:52.28]The cat got away.
[89:56.43]I'm stuck in a trash can.
[89:57.35]Where's the cat?
[89:59.61]My game's moving on its own.
[90:02.35]I am not pressing any buttons.
[90:06.50]I'll be right there.
[90:07.30]I'll be right back.
[90:08.66]Yeah, my game is fucked.
[90:11.72]I'm moving on my own.
[90:12.92]Okay, wait.
[90:13.42]I think it's fine.
[90:23.96]How do I join the game again?
[90:25.28]Okay.
[90:26.76]Everybody relax.
[90:28.15]Join off the steam.
[90:30.93]I can't.
[90:32.11]Oh, you can't.
[90:32.61]Maybe it's because we're in the middle of the game.
[90:35.17]Hold on.
[90:35.35]Maybe I have an idea I can give you.
[90:36.48]Hold on.
[90:41.40]Session ID.
[90:42.00]I can give it to you.
[90:42.52]The cat's getting away while we're standing here.
[90:46.95]Apparently don't show this on stream, but that is the session ID.
[90:54.07]Cat's getting away!
[90:55.21]What do you mean the cat- where?
[90:56.27]Where's the cat?
[90:58.69]It was running.
[90:59.97]Invalid session- oh.
[91:01.95]Alright, joining.
[91:04.58]I'm moving by its- my character's moving by itself!
[91:06.56]I know, I was doing- we keep- I think we're dying too many times.
[91:09.22]We're messing with the multiverse.
[91:13.99]Get the fuck out of here!
[91:15.35]Oh my god, dude.
[91:17.33]Where's the cat?
[91:19.13]My character's movement is so fucking glitched right now,
[91:25.81]I think I found the cat.
[91:26.59]I think the cat's here.
[91:27.39]They should make this a shooter.
[91:30.81]Just repackage this game and just make a shooter.
[91:34.00]Um.
[91:35.86]They can remake H1Z1.
[91:38.46]Why is there meat over here?
[91:43.19]Check on the chicken.
[91:44.03]I got it.
[91:44.61]I got it.
[91:45.15]I found it.
[91:46.07]It was by this tree.
[91:49.91]What?
[91:50.13]Where are you?
[91:52.94]I'm by the store.
[91:54.79]It was like stuck on a tree walking away.
[91:56.71]Do you have it?
[92:04.20]Chicken is gone.
[92:08.93]Oh, thank God.
[92:09.57]Okay.
[92:11.19]She's safe.
[92:16.14]Star shot the cat and bought another in the wrong color.
[92:21.98]You fooled me!
[92:23.59]You fooled me!
[92:24.51]You fooled me!
[92:25.05]Is that the cat over here?
[92:26.09]Is that the cat?
[92:28.43]Is this the cat over here, you fucking monster?
[92:31.23]No, no.
[92:32.95]It's the same cat, Billy.
[92:34.28]I thought it was the same cat.
[92:37.48]You fucking maniac.
[92:38.86]As soon as I see you, it's on sight.
[92:41.50]It's on sight.
[92:42.36]Fuck you.
[92:42.84]Put that cat down now.
[92:44.15]No, because I'm carrying the cat and it loves it.
[92:46.29]I'm holding it.
[92:48.21]Poke.
[92:48.51]Shoot him.
[92:51.70]I got the cat.
[92:52.46]Don't do it.
[92:52.88]I can't.
[92:54.75]Why are you killing me?
[92:56.17]He's the one that's trying to put a new cat off as an old cat.
[92:59.13]And it turned into fucking... Get the cat.
[93:05.39]Get the cat.
[93:06.55]Do not.
[93:08.35]He tried to...
[93:09.21]I got the cat.
[93:10.30]Don't even revive him.
[93:11.06]Let him fucking rot.
[93:15.06]I'm getting the bug you had where I just got up and I'm just force running.
[93:18.46]I thought this was the same cat, dude.
[93:21.64]Where's the cat?
[93:24.77]He's trying to steal you.
[93:26.13]Where's the cat?
[93:26.69]Go, go, go, go, go.
[93:28.69]Get in, get in.
[93:29.77]That's the game.
[93:30.75]He has to take the cat from us.
[93:32.21]Run.
[93:33.94]I'm trying to shake him off.
[93:36.08]Good, good.
[93:37.90]Help me.
[93:38.70]Help me.
[93:39.94]Help me.
[93:40.30]I can't.
[93:45.16]Damn it.
[93:48.07]Where's the cat?
[93:48.43]Where's it?
[93:50.53]Wait.
[93:50.89]Where'd the cat go?
[93:52.41]Got it.
[93:52.65]I got it.
[93:55.82]Vinny, I got you.
[94:01.59]My fucking stomach hurts, dude.
[94:03.45]No, what happened?
[94:04.35]I was knocked out.
[94:07.84]Can't stop moving forward.
[94:08.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[94:13.54]Hey!
[94:14.49]Where's the cat?
[94:15.87]The cat was on the fucking roof of the car.
[94:18.19]Where's the cat now?
[94:20.92]Did it turn into me?
[94:21.62]I'm glitched.
[94:23.44]Oh.
[94:25.22]It's right here.
[94:28.17]Oh, this is fucking messed up, dude.
[94:36.54]Can we go back to the house now?
[94:39.90]No, I'm dead!
[94:40.90]Get me up!
[94:41.63]Yeah, well...
[94:42.15]I can't get in the...
[94:43.17]I can't get in the car.
[94:43.85]Once that cat is secured, then... Poke it in the car, get ready to drive.
[94:49.05]I'll revive him only when that's happening.
[94:54.20]I can't interact with anything.
[94:57.56]Oh my god.
[94:58.22]Poke, if you didn't say anything, I would have thought that was the other cat.
[95:02.25]I didn't know!
[95:02.95]It would have taken me like a week.
[95:04.27]One of my chat members told me.
[95:05.77]They ratted out a Ster.
[95:07.25]Oh, yeah, that wasn't Vinny that said that.
[95:08.45]Oh my god.
[95:12.30]Okay, Ster is... Let's get out of here.
[95:15.87]Do we have food for the cat?
[95:17.83]I don't know.
[95:18.35]No.
[95:19.25]Because our chicken ran away or died.
[95:21.62]And or died.
[95:24.80]You're gonna be a... Oh, that's so fucking awful.
[95:32.05]So the meat that I found was the cat.
[95:34.16]That's fucking twisted.
[95:44.64]I'm looking for Ster.
[95:45.46]I don't know where he is.
[95:46.42]Let's see.
[95:46.78]No, I don't like the fact that he hasn't said anything.
[95:48.38]He's at the general store again.
[95:52.88]You know he's buying some fucked up shit right now.
[95:55.75]Check your bank account.
[95:57.65]Check your bank account.
[95:59.49]He bought a meat grinder.
[96:01.71]He bought a meat grinder.
[96:06.12]No.
[96:07.30]He bought a sausage maker.
[96:14.25]No.
[96:17.02]I'm not eating anything he gives me.
[96:19.00]If he makes a fucking cat sausage, I ain't eating it.
[96:21.60]I'm not eating that shit.
[96:23.01]Kill him.
[96:23.43]Just fucking kill him.
[96:24.13]I'm killing him when he comes in on sight.
[96:26.45]The chicken is here and is fully fed.
[96:29.99]What the fuck?
[96:33.68]No chicken in the map.
[96:35.08]That's cheating.
[96:36.24]That's really weird.
[96:39.13]Listen.
[96:41.05]You see him?
[96:41.87]The game still has to invade us and steal a chicken.
[96:45.27]Defend the chicken.
[96:49.46]Defend the cat and chicken.
[96:52.84]I'll hold.
[96:53.91]I'll shoot him.
[96:54.67]Alright.
[96:55.33]Who wants to hold?
[96:57.33]Wait, where's the cat?
[96:58.61]Uh-oh.
[96:58.75]You guys are going to have to, like, turn a profit at some point.
[97:02.22]Actually, no, genuinely, where is the cat?
[97:04.38]Okay.
[97:04.80]Cat's right here.
[97:06.38]Oh, you're supposed to bring wild meat to the hunter's hut.
[97:09.77]We got a lot of that.
[97:12.76]Can we sleep?
[97:18.13]There should be separate ranches and we just like, fight each other.
[97:22.25]Yeah.
[97:22.49]We're just looking to play Team Fortress, basically.
[97:31.18]I can't fucking believe it's a different cat.
[97:33.65]You turned our other poor cat into fucking sausages.
[97:38.61]The cat, it went out to an arm on vacation.
[97:42.87]What happened?
[97:44.62]I'm kidding.
[97:46.60]I shouldn't scare you.
[97:47.72]I thought it sniped me from like 100 yards away.
[97:49.94]Here.
[97:54.43]Press R. Yeah.
[98:00.09]I'm fucking hiding with this thing.
[98:01.21]He scares the shit out of me.
[98:06.81]Is there any other, like, tasks we are going to do in the game?
[98:10.49]I don't know.
[98:11.39]There's a cat pissing on me.
[98:13.38]In my face.
[98:14.96]Wait, what?
[98:15.46]The cat just pissed in my face.
[98:17.34]What are you talking about?
[98:18.48]What?
[98:23.27]Where is it?
[98:24.49]I went to sleep and he went over my face and...
[98:28.84]I don't know.
[98:29.12]Where is it?
[98:31.52]I don't know.
[98:31.90]It's gone.
[98:33.08]What the fuck?
[98:33.74]Where's the cat?
[98:38.53]Oh, right here.
[98:40.30]Just chillin'.
[98:44.24]Alright, I wanna see what you saw.
[98:46.19]Yo, is Stirr muted?
[98:47.01]Where is he?
[98:48.95]Stirr is muted and it's scary.
[98:50.17]I don't like it.
[98:52.80]Look at the woods.
[98:54.74]Look at the woods?
[98:57.52]He might be out there.
[98:58.95]Is he out in the woods?
[99:07.95]I- I'm gonna hold the cat.
[99:09.59]That's a good place to hide.
[99:17.04]We have a lot of wood, we should build a tower.
[99:20.23]I'm looking for movement.
[99:21.37]What the fuck was that?
[99:25.66]I see him, he's by the house that we haven't fully built.
[99:28.32]He's by the house.
[99:29.60]Oh fuck, you fuckers!
[99:31.91]You killed him?
[99:32.47]Where did he go?

[100:25.52]I really did bring another cat down from the shop, and I put it down.
[100:28.85]I don't know where it went.
[100:30.45]There's two cats running around.
[100:31.65]They're both fine.
[100:33.47]Oh, where are they?
[100:34.57]I don't know.
[100:35.21]I'm not telling you.

[100:40.17]Where are they?
[100:40.81]Oh, I see it.
[100:42.30]Can you revive me?
[100:42.84]No!
[100:43.98]Revive me and I'll tell you.
[100:46.12]I've got him.
[100:47.81]And I'm gonna pet him.
[100:48.45]He's dead by daylight.
[100:49.45]For real now.

[101:14.97]Vinny, did you get him?
[101:16.72]No, he got me.
[101:17.62]How could you have blown that?
[101:21.60]I couldn't switch my weapon fast enough.
[101:24.34]What?
[101:26.97]You can't shoot me.
[101:27.63]I'm holding a cat.
[101:31.27]I got him.
[101:31.83]I got him.
[101:33.70]Please get me back up.
[101:34.80]Alright, I got you.
[101:41.04]Alright.

[101:46.67]No!
[101:47.83]You crazy motherfucker!
[101:49.15]What?
[101:49.65]Why did you revive him?
[101:51.11]Why did you revive him?
[101:54.04]How did he get back to life?
[102:00.16]Oh, sorry.
[102:00.51]I killed you because you revived him.
[102:03.56]Get him.
[102:04.12]Get him.
[102:04.52]Get this motherfucker right now.
[102:09.27]That's fucking demented, dude.
[102:15.20]Just leave him dead.
[102:16.62]Do not revive him.
[102:18.56]In fact, you know what, dude?
[102:19.48]Just fucking un... Everybody stand around him.
[102:22.42]Make sure he doesn't get up.
[102:23.22]Everyone on the count of three, reload.
[102:25.03]Aim into him.
[102:26.25]Make sure he never gets up.
[102:28.49]You ready?
[102:29.41]Alright, three.

[102:53.40]Okay.
[102:55.57]We have not played.
[102:56.27]I failed my betrayal plan my whole fucking life.
[102:58.53]How long have we been in this game for?
[103:01.82]An hour and a half maybe we sold one egg We sold a chicken carcass in an egg, yeah pretty much Wait what happens if we all shoot each other the same exact time?
[103:20.10]Like the game just ends alright What what how is he alive?
[103:29.59]Let's all do it everyone shoot each other the same time
[103:33.15]Wait, after they fight.
[103:40.08]Fuck you!
[103:40.76]What the fuck?
[103:43.17]Where's the cat?
[103:45.09]We don't even know.
[103:46.67]Dude, heavy is so penis.
[103:52.44]I need my controller to help me out here.
[103:54.46]Let there be... Let this be a... For a lesson in game design.
[103:59.45]Get out of here!
[104:00.23]Provide me!
[104:00.89]You fucking weirdo!
[104:02.43]this is a lesson in game design if you have a game where it's four player or more fucking stop it revive me oh bro when I get up you are fucking toast um okay digging your grave
[104:31.98]If you make a game and you have friendly fire and put guns in it, I don't know if your players are going to do very much else.
[104:42.89]What did we do?
[104:43.61]He did the looper.
[104:47.80]I got them.
[104:51.14]See, because he keeps leaving the ranch.
[104:52.62]That's why he's able to do this.
[104:54.11]He keeps leaving.
[104:57.03]Vinny, did your hair change?
[105:00.89]Yes.
[105:05.53]He knows.
[105:06.83]The trickster knows the tricks.
[105:10.37]Oh, you're leaving and joining the game again.
[105:16.40]Oh, what a fuckface.
[105:17.50]Yeah, fuck's very extreme.
[105:19.80]It really became that.
[105:22.12]Oh, I bet.
[105:22.40]Remember what I did?
[105:23.08]As soon as that fucking car went over the mountain, it was over.
[105:25.91]Hey, look, remember?
[105:26.79]Look what I did.
[105:27.45]You sprint run and then shoot in the air.
[105:29.79]Like, right-click in the air after you sprint jump.
[105:32.39]It's funny as shit.
[105:36.14]What the fuck?
[105:37.24]Why did he spawn there?
[105:38.10]I thought he spawns right here.
[105:38.94]I didn't even finish seeing the loading menu.
[105:51.36]It's just so good.
[105:52.70]It's just so good.
[105:53.50]You so deserve it.
[105:56.66]They're spawn camping me.
[105:59.23]Alright, alright.
[106:00.11]Let's...
[106:00.35]Remember how we bought a fucking thousand bullets?
[106:02.17]We're gonna run out of them again.
[106:04.44]We really shouldn't have bought bullets.
[106:06.60]It just all went to shit as soon as... We were cooperating.
[106:09.78]We were building a fucking log tower to heaven.
[106:13.69]Didn't reload the gun.
[106:18.03]Somebody said... Can we at least have a funeral for the cat?
[106:22.62]Somebody said those two cats are going to make a feral colony.
[106:27.69]What two cats?
[106:31.81]okay um should we have we crossed a point of no return here yeah yeah this is the point oh this is the two hour zone this game is fun though this is a good one yeah I feel like it's a really good game
[106:57.95]He didn't even get it.
[107:00.09]He didn't get it.
[107:01.43]He was point blank.
[107:03.30]He missed every shot.
[107:04.44]Go through the fence.
[107:09.87]Yeah, good luck.
[107:17.78]You took it.
[107:20.14]Oh.
[107:23.07]I'm fucking done, dude.
[107:25.37]Alright, I'm done.
[107:25.77]I'm done.
[107:26.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[107:28.34]Are chickens dead?
[107:30.20]Yeah.
[107:31.22]Yeah.
[107:32.69]God, can you shoot yourself in this game?
[107:35.87]After all this?
[107:36.69]Jesus.
[107:37.09]I don't want to fucking be here anymore.
[107:39.62]Pull out the gun while you're sleeping?
[107:45.51]Can you do that?
[107:46.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:47.83]Oh my god.
[107:48.67]What a fucking disaster.
[107:53.10]It's too bad that tower didn't work.
[107:55.12]Guys.
[107:56.81]guys you can shoot while you're asleep oh man can somebody revive me shoot all at once before you refund this day this day this does not get a refund I'm sorry I got my I yeah it was totally worth it there was there was a lot of good stuff I got my money's worth and then so I'll shoot Vinny before we do that I just want to show you something take a look at this
[108:26.81]sleeping and shooting wait if I crouch down shoot no way I guess I'm gonna mosey on out of here can you guys fight each other in there like that story can you count down
[108:46.20]I'm not in the game.
[108:46.98]I closed the game.
[108:47.68]I just need to count down.
[108:49.33]I'll shoot Jerma, Vinny shoots me, and Jerma shoots...
[108:53.03]Put your back to each other, and then 10 paces.
[108:56.04]Well, is the goal to try to make it so nobody is alive to revive and the game has to exit?
[109:00.12]Yeah.
[109:00.90]Okay.
[109:01.79]So, Poke's shooting me, I'm shooting Vinny.
[109:05.09]Vinny, you have to shoot Poke.
[109:06.91]Yep.
[109:07.56]Okay, so we're going to go on the count of three?
[109:09.34]So, 3, 2, 1, go, or 3, 2, 1?
[109:11.42]I think it's 3, 2, 1, boom.
[109:14.92]Ready?
[109:15.34]Ster count.
[109:16.22]Ster count us, because, yeah, that'd be the most unbiased.
[109:18.01]Do we say the word boom?
[109:19.27]The word boom, we shoot.
[109:20.03]When the word one is over, you shoot.
[109:22.35]So it's one, two.
[109:23.36]One is over.
[109:24.16]That's not going to be precise enough.
[109:26.30]We need, like, one, two, three.
[109:28.24]No, I'm going to do three, two, one, and when the one is over, shoot.
[109:31.63]Wait, what?
[109:33.03]No, it's three.
[109:35.11]Listen, it's three, two, one, shoot.
[109:40.05]And say the word shoot, Ster, because the timing, the latency between everybody, we're going to go on you.
[109:44.92]Why does no one understand what I'm saying?
[109:46.96]You never go on zero.
[109:48.30]Just shoot on one.
[109:49.09]Just shoot on one.
[109:50.07]Three, two, shoot.
[109:52.35]That kind of thing.
[109:53.09]No!
[109:53.83]What?
[109:54.27]I thought he was going.
[109:55.20]I thought he was going.
[109:58.02]Alright.
[109:58.32]No, let's try that again.
[109:59.28]Okay, focus up.
[109:59.92]Focus.
[110:00.27]Here it comes.
[110:00.79]Whatever happens, happens.
[110:02.81]Three, two, one, shoot.
[110:05.77]Are you on one?
[110:06.67]Why'd you go on one?
[110:07.71]We gotta go on shoot.
[110:09.29]Yeah, why'd you go on one, Vinny?
[110:10.75]I don't know.
[110:12.27]Why did I make that so hard?
[110:14.84]Listen.
[110:16.26]Stop.
[110:16.60]Stop.
[110:17.00]Ster.
[110:17.52]You are going to say three, two, one, shoot.
[110:21.14]We are not going to do anything.
[110:22.10]We are going to go when we hear you say shoot.
[110:24.46]Because with latency, we can't count down each other.
[110:28.99]You ready?
[110:30.43]Yeah, I'm going to hear shoot.
[110:31.93]On shoot.
[110:33.80]No!
[110:34.46]Three.
[110:35.68]Why would you say...
[110:36.44]Okay, okay, okay.
[110:43.27]Three.
[110:45.93]You count down faster than that!
[110:47.74]One.
[110:48.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:49.90]Do a real one.
[110:50.56]Do a real timing of seconds.
[110:53.18]Real-time seconds.
[110:55.15]Three, two, one.
[110:57.79]Shoot.
[110:59.87]we can we can definitely get this that was close I don't even know what I can't even see what's happening alright Ster three two one shoot did you miss me the timing is too oh I hit main menu again oh wait you're sitting on the like you're sitting for me just you and poke maybe yeah
[111:29.33]Maybe we can do it.
[111:33.36]Okay, ready?
[111:33.82]Three, two, one, shoot.
[111:36.16]Okay, I gotta go.
[111:37.26]I'm gonna eat dinner.
[111:38.66]Thanks for playing, Ster.
[111:40.41]It was fun.
[111:43.01]I'll see you later.
[111:44.05]Ready?
[111:44.33]Vinny, count it.
[111:45.23]You don't expect it.
[111:47.05]Three, two, one, shoot.
[111:51.12]Damn it.
[111:52.94]One more.
[111:58.21]Vinny, one more.
[111:59.84]Three, two, one, shoot.
[112:04.09]Oh, there's a guy running in the game!
[112:06.46]Is that Vinny?
[112:07.78]Huh?
[112:08.02]Yeah, I'm back.
[112:08.34]Oh, you rejoined?
[112:08.86]Oh, I thought that... Dude, I got freaked.
[112:12.33]Dude, my chat...
[112:12.67]He's a hacker.
[112:13.66]My chat is telling me what the fuck also.
[112:15.88]There's a guy running in the fucking field.
[112:18.81]In the fog, no less.
[112:20.93]Alright, here we go.
[112:21.67]Three, two, one, shoot.
[112:26.30]No.
[112:27.56]No, but you're going on your shoot, which is a delay.
[112:29.76]Why don't we use the in-game clock?
[112:32.17]Let's use the in-game clock.
[112:33.33]In-game clock?
[112:34.09]At the top there.
[112:35.01]Oh, I see, yep.
[112:35.93]11, at 11, exactly 11.
[112:37.79]Let me reload.
[112:41.96]Okay, at 11?
[112:42.84]No, 11.05.
[112:43.44]11.05.
[112:46.45]I don't know, five?
[112:47.61]We got this, 11.
[112:48.27]Okay, 11, 11, 11.
[112:53.68]Why did that take so long to count?
[112:55.26]Vinny, I swear to God, you missed me.
[112:57.87]I didn't even shoot.
[112:59.47]Oh.
[113:01.96]Alright, last try.
[113:03.80]11, 10.
[113:04.34]11, 10.
[113:07.70]Get real close.
[113:08.39]Get real close.
[113:08.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[113:09.81]A little further.
[113:10.47]Alright.
[113:15.16]You went on 1109.
[113:16.14]It was way too soon.
[113:19.92]Alright, I'm done.
[113:21.56]This is crazy, though.
[113:25.51]I can't believe we played Ranch Simulator without ranching.
[113:30.61]Three.
[113:31.17]Three.
[113:31.97]Three.
[113:32.71]On my go.
[113:34.13]Three.
[113:34.47]Two.
[113:35.90]Where are you guys moving?
[113:37.96]Three.
[113:38.32]Vinny, you should have driven more.
[113:41.58]Wait.
[113:44.28]Three, two, one.
[113:48.19]I'm getting out of here.
[113:54.74]It was good playing with you guys.
[113:55.96]It was a lot of fun.
[113:56.60]Yeah, it was great.
[113:58.22]Oh, fucking hell.
[113:59.44]That was so good.
[114:00.18]My face hurts.
[114:00.82]My back hurts.
[114:01.84]That was fucking hilarious.
[114:03.39]Yeah, that was amazing.
[114:04.37]Alright.
[114:04.81]I'm going to send you guys a clip in the group of the fucking car from my screen.
[114:09.53]It was amazing.
[114:10.21]It was incredible.
[114:11.28]I will absolutely watch it.
[114:14.17]Bye, guys.
[114:14.57]Have a good night.
[114:16.17]Bye.
[114:18.20]Oh, man.
[114:20.92]That was so funny.
[114:22.79]What an insane game.
[114:24.79]Again, all it takes is just give a task that is not the game
[114:32.26]That's a fun game too.
[114:33.32]Alright, I'm going to give you the real take.
[114:34.76]That was fun.
[114:35.54]I feel like this game could be really fun if you actually ranch and not do team deathmatch for 45 minutes.
[114:42.33]But that was great.
[114:45.28]Okay, I want to see this clip.
[114:48.40]I'll show the clip and then I'm going to get out of here.
[114:51.00]And then the next time you guys see me, I will be playing SEGA CD.
[114:54.45]We're going SEGA CD, probably not for at least a few days.
[114:58.43]Maybe probably early in the week.
[115:04.56]What's today?
[115:04.94]Wednesday?
[115:05.26]Thursday?
[115:06.68]Maybe this weekend.
[115:08.08]If I get everything set up that I want to get set up for it, then we could play it... Yeah, within the next three or four days.
[115:16.09]So either late this weekend or somewhere in that Monday or Tuesday.
[115:20.68]I want to make sure it's ready.
[115:21.54]I want to make sure it's good to go.
[115:23.22]Because there are a lot of games to play.
[115:25.16]And I want to take my time with it.
[115:26.48]I got a nice new upscaler.
[115:28.99]So I'm really ready for it.
[115:32.45]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[115:35.50]And let me just, how do I exit?
[115:37.99]There we go.
[115:38.25]Alright, let me see this clip.
[115:49.18]Get it over here and we can watch it.
[115:54.21]What the fuck?
[115:56.23]Okay.
[115:57.71]Alright, let's open this.
[116:04.50]Here we go.
[116:06.66]Watch this funny clip.
[116:12.68]Oh, that didn't work.
[116:13.43]There we go.
[116:14.15]This car's bugged.
[116:14.75]This car's bugged.
[116:15.45]Hit it.
[116:15.85]I don't even know where anybody even is.
[116:17.01]Look what's happening.
[116:17.77]Look what's happening.
[116:18.83]Oh, look at the right.
[116:21.94]That's crazy.
[116:23.40]What just happened?
[116:24.26]No, I missed it.
[116:24.84]Where are they?
[116:25.68]Poke.
[116:28.52]What happened?
[116:29.10]Oh.
[116:30.99]That's crazy.
[116:31.73]You didn't see what happened to that RV?
[116:34.62]I saw it lift.
[116:35.52]I was too far.
[116:36.52]Dude, it was on its front wheels.
[116:39.59]You should be able to ping the fucking map to see.
[116:41.35]Oh, wait.
[116:41.83]I can see where you guys are.
[116:45.62]Well, that was phenomenal.
[116:46.62]What a fun time.
[116:51.47]Think of how much the vibes that happened today.
[116:55.88]Vibes were kind of off.
[116:57.08]Vibes were back on.
[116:58.26]Vibes were on.
[116:59.13]Vibes were off.
[116:59.89]And then the vibes ended insanely.
[117:10.82]Jerma hit the, wow, that's crazy.
[117:13.07]It was crazy.
[117:16.27]Yeah, I'm very, very excited for SEGA CD.
[117:18.49]For those of you that missed the last time this happened, gotta be at least six or seven years.
[117:26.27]Maybe even eight years ago.
[117:28.50]I got...
[117:29.01]SEGA CD out, dusted it off, plugged it in, hooked it to a capture card, and we played a bunch of stuff.
[117:35.23]This time, there's way more, and a lot of these are pretty obscure.
[117:39.74]A lot of these are maybe a little bit more rare, I don't know, in regards to SEGA CD.
[117:44.93]SEGA CD, it's become one of my favorite consoles with the 3DO, in retrospect.
[117:50.86]And what I really want to do is I want to show all the discs and all the cases.
[117:56.31]I think it's really cool and interesting.
[117:58.27]I actually think the SEGA CD is some of the most interesting boxes.
[118:02.86]I think they were the coolest boxes.
[118:04.58]They're those long boxes.
[118:08.04]Kind of like those 3DO boxes.
[118:12.45]And we're not going to rush any of the games.
[118:13.71]I want to take my time with it.
[118:14.51]It's going to take a long time to get through it.
[118:16.80]Not going to happen in the first...
[118:20.02]week so I'm gonna keep it in the back pocket we'll do a couple of them in a row and once we get through you know 5 10 15 of them we'll put it on cooldown for a week or two
[118:33.01]And then we'll go back to it after another week or so.
[118:36.10]It's going to take probably at least a few months.
[118:37.84]But I will tell you, either October 30th or October 31st is Dracula Unleashed for the SEGA CD.
[118:46.17]That is my plan.
[118:48.80]That game's going to take at least probably four or five hours to get through.
[118:51.98]I don't know if we're going to play the whole thing, but I'm anticipating we're going to get at least a few hours into it.
[119:08.25]What are your thoughts on Buffalo Chicken Wraps?
[119:09.71]They're amazing.
[119:11.03]I haven't had one in a long time, but they're good.
[119:13.77]Yeah, don't look it up either.
[119:15.01]Don't spoil yourself.
[119:18.60]It is described as an interactive movie.
[119:23.30]That's all I'm going to tell you.
[119:25.63]And it is for the SEGA CD.
[119:27.31]We are getting blown up on original hardware.
[119:32.11]It's going to be a little crusty, but it might look pretty good.
[119:34.52]Because I got a new upscaler.
[119:46.27]Yeah, take care.
[119:47.93]See you within the next three to five days.
[119:50.73]In like a couple days, I'll come back and give a more concrete.
[119:55.38]But it's going to be SEGA CD.
[119:57.61]It's going to be crazy.
[120:02.01]Take care.
[120:03.82]Call your mother.
[120:04.96]See you later.
[120:05.50]See you soon.
[120:07.00]Bye-bye.
