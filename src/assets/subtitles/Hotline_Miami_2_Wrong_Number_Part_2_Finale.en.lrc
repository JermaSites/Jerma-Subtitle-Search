[00:01.78]Holy shit, he's early.
[00:06.02]Yeah, very early.
[00:06.78]There's a reason for that, though.
[00:10.21]There's always a reason for it, and these are the reasons why.
[00:15.24]It is 12 PM Pacific.
[00:19.38]I'm awake.
[00:20.98]I'm kind of back on an incredibly early sleep schedule.
[00:24.72]I went to the doctor yesterday.
[00:30.59]I didn't mean to be on this schedule.
[00:33.45]But I went to the doctor yesterday and had some blood work done.
[00:38.85]And they took like seven vials of blood.
[00:43.70]And I was like, well, I'm getting a little fucking lightheaded.
[00:46.88]I came home and I just fell asleep.
[00:52.37]I like went right to bed, and I woke up with like 4 30 in the morning So I mean come on.
[00:59.69]We're here, right?
[01:05.14]Blood talk uh I mean it was in the vial so you didn't you didn't you don't touch the blood you just have to know it was there
[01:16.52]So I'm going to go over a few things that are very important and they include all of you.
[01:23.14]Well, maybe not all of you, but a large portion of you.
[01:28.78]So give me a minute.
[01:30.64]I will be right back and we can get started.
[01:33.81]Okay.
[01:34.55]See you in a second.
[02:29.46]What the fuck are you guys saying?
[02:30.66]This guy's too early?
[02:38.06]Yeah, I mean, don't expect streams like this to happen all the time.
[02:42.92]But, I was blood tired last night.
[02:46.50]I'm not gonna be blood tired every day.
[02:52.01]They took too much of my blood, and it made me really tired.
[02:57.71]That sounds really fucked up.
[03:02.97]But tonight, or today, well today, it's not even tonight.
[03:06.21]Maybe it's tonight for some of you guys.
[03:07.11]We're going to play Hotline Miami 2.
[03:08.93]I'm going to try to finish it.
[03:10.17]I have a fresh take on it.
[03:12.38]It kicked the shit out of me a couple days ago.
[03:16.52]But I said I was going to persevere and I was going to try my hardest to beat it.
[03:22.47]And even if we don't, let's just say I get to a portion of the game where I can't do it and I'm going to freak out.
[03:30.73]It's alright.
[03:31.81]Because there's also, I got a bunch of community workshop levels as well.
[03:38.00]I got a little sampling of workshop levels to check out.
[03:42.02]So if it does get to a point where it's just not completable for me, we'll be good.
[03:50.33]So, uh, let's talk about... No, not yet.
[03:53.25]Not yet.
[03:53.69]I'm gonna wait for most people to be here.
[03:58.11]Because it's about Christmas.
[04:00.39]It's about the Christmas Eve stream that is happening.
[04:04.28]And it's going to involve... Uh, you guys.
[04:08.98]Do it now.
[04:09.56]Alright.
[04:09.86]You know, fine.
[04:10.40]Fuck it.
[04:10.70]We'll do it now.
[04:13.02]How will we wait?
[04:14.61]I'll do it now.
[04:16.45]So, um...
[04:18.65]Let's start by saying that there's going to be a live stream on Christmas Eve.
[04:23.15]That's December 24th.
[04:26.24]The stream is going to be at some point in the afternoon Pacific.
[04:32.16]Probably like early evening.
[04:34.08]I'd say around maybe... Probably around like 3 to 4 p.m.
[04:38.94]Pacific time is when it'll probably start.
[04:41.82]And it's going to be a Christmas slash Halloween extravaganza.
[04:48.16]Because I missed a Halloween stream, I typically like to do Halloween themed streams.
[04:52.98]So we're going to do both.
[04:59.53]And at the apex kind of the climax of the night is going to involve you guys doing some stuff.
[05:06.55]And what does that mean?
[05:07.96]Well, there's going to be a secret Santa chat gives me presents portion of the stream.
[05:14.84]Remember how a week or so ago we talked about, man, wouldn't it be funny if chat, I just let them kind of decide what to buy on Amazon?
[05:23.95]Well, what a perfect time to do that.
[05:26.33]So, there is a channel, there's a channel in the Discord called Secret Santa Suggestions.
[05:33.51]What you're going to do in that channel is you're going to give suggestions of what you would like to give me for Christmas.
[05:47.56]And from those suggestions, there will be selections.
[05:53.05]The moderators are going to be selecting.
[05:55.91]So there's no voting, there's no nominations or anything like that.
[06:00.07]It's just suggestions the mods are going to be taking from that channel.
[06:03.94]Then I'm going to buy them, but I'm not going to know.
[06:08.68]Because I'm going to have Kim is going to buy them for me.
[06:13.76]And then she's going to wrap them.
[06:15.63]And I am going to have no fucking idea what they are.
[06:20.38]And I'm going to open them on stream.
[06:25.62]So, there are some criteria involved in this, as you can probably imagine.
[06:37.00]Let's go over them right now.
[06:38.68]You wanted me to talk about it, so let's talk about it.
[06:41.36]There will absolutely, absolutely no living creatures
[06:48.49]So, oh, that's right.
[06:49.49]Let's put on the list 50,000 ants.
[06:53.81]Oh, no, no, no.
[06:55.67]Your suggestion has to be under no more than $50.
[07:00.96]So we're talking zero to $50 is what your suggestion can be.
[07:05.06]It has to be an Amazon link and it has to be prime ready.
[07:10.87]So has to be an Amazon link, has to be prime ready, has to be under $50.
[07:20.45]What happened to the channel?
[07:22.19]Is it not there?
[07:25.74]The channel is gone?
[07:26.72]No, it's here.
[07:38.39]The channel is gone.
[07:41.35]No, it's here.
[07:41.99]It should be okay now.
[07:47.41]So, by the way, in that channel...
[07:50.22]Please.
[07:51.58]Do not.
[07:52.52]That's not a chat channel, by the way.
[07:54.63]Not a chat channel.
[07:56.65]Not a chat channel.
[07:59.39]Wait, no, don't do that.
[08:00.59]Oh, wait, wait, should I, should I, wait, okay, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna, well, disable those permissions for a second.
[08:05.73]Let me explain this.
[08:08.49]Listen, okay.
[08:09.70]So.
[08:11.28]Everybody just jumped in there and fucking started spamming.
[08:13.66]Let me explain the rules before you do anything crazy.
[08:17.59]So in, remember, that is not a chat channel.
[08:21.13]That is a suggestion channel, and you are only allowed three suggestions per person, and the mods are going to be very strict on this.
[08:30.82]Okay, it's a chat channel, we get it.
[08:33.16]You know, that channel's a chat channel.
[08:39.56]Read the spam that got in.
[08:41.20]Okay.
[08:42.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not, I'm not.
[08:44.26]Because I don't, I don't want to give any opinions.
[08:53.38]I don't want to know what you guys are going to have me buy, and that's the thing.
[08:58.34]I'm going to be opening presents that I'm purchasing, sending to myself, wrapped up from you guys.
[09:07.37]Because think about that.
[09:08.27]People say, oh, he's buying his own Christmas presents.
[09:10.17]What an egomaniac.
[09:11.27]Am I, though?
[09:12.83]You know, you guys subscribe to this channel.
[09:15.31]You guys give money to this channel.
[09:16.69]Are you sure that it's not you guys?
[09:19.31]With your suggestion?
[09:21.67]He's a fucking sicko.
[09:28.54]Like an egomaniac.
[09:30.28]That's right.
[09:30.74]I'm going to open a present.
[09:32.64]These are presents to me.
[09:35.22]But I did mention that I wanted to do it, and the maximum money is going to be 500 bucks.
[09:40.25]So, there's not going to be a shitload of... So, by the way, knowing that, and the mods are going to have full discretion here.
[09:49.19]Oh, I have an idea for a present.
[09:51.27]How about like a $499 Vive?
[09:56.06]Don't do that.
[09:57.02]It has to be under 50 bucks.
[09:59.12]The lower, I mean, you could make it a good suggestion if it's higher in price because that gives you more of a, you know, reason why it would be picked.
[10:07.07]Thought it'd be a fun idea.
[10:08.71]And that's just one portion of the stream on Christmas Eve.
[10:12.57]A $50 fake Vive.
[10:22.20]Metal Socks just gave 50 bucks right now.
[10:28.24]Thank you so much, Metal Socks.
[10:30.68]They say, hey, Jerm, I haven't been able to... I haven't been catching up to streams.
[10:34.30]Work's pushing me hard, but watching the VODs and second channel stuff really made this whole year for me.
[10:38.28]I hope you and all the... I hope you and all have a happy Decemberween and a happy New Yard.
[10:46.37]Well, thank you, Metal Socks.
[10:49.13]That's big money.
[10:50.59]Thank you.
[10:55.28]Can we donate bits towards a bigger Christmas budget?
[10:59.04]No, no, no.
[11:02.64]$500 is it.
[11:03.38]That's it.
[11:05.92]No bigger Christmas budget.
[11:10.10]By the way, because of the short notice here, that channel, suggestions are only going to be able to be put in that channel until tomorrow, tomorrow evening.
[11:22.09]You know, essentially like a little bit more than 24 hours from now because I have to get them here.
[11:27.94]So, if you have a suggestion and you got a good one, make sure you get it in there.
[11:31.48]Make sure it's an Amazon Prime link.
[11:35.16]A link to an Amazon product that is Prime shippable.
[11:38.87]Otherwise, I'm not going to be able to get it here in time.
[11:45.97]Don't tell me.
[11:46.77]Don't give me any ideas.
[11:48.93]I don't want to see any of these.
[11:51.13]If you got a good one, get it in there.
[11:59.44]Why not a bigger budget than 500?
[12:02.42]Because, I don't know, I didn't want... I didn't want to be sitting there, opening like 60 Christmas presents.
[12:09.66]You know how fucked up that would be?
[12:13.51]Oh, hey, well, Merry Christmas to me!
[12:15.19]Here's like 75 Christmas presents.
[12:18.79]That's just like, that's like next level.
[12:25.55]Can it be eBay?
[12:26.25]It cannot.
[12:26.85]It has to be on Amazon.
[12:29.72]No animals, no live creatures, no pari- listen, no perishable food items.
[12:35.78]If your item is perishable, do not link it in that, it's not gonna get used.
[12:40.08]No sexual shit.
[12:42.31]I don't even have to say the D word.
[12:43.55]You know what I'm saying?
[12:44.81]Like, no- none of that.
[12:47.01]That's not gonna get taken.
[12:56.79]Boring No, it's called I don't want to get in fucking trouble I'm gonna be in the studio guys you want to send me like 20,000 ants and have me open it and be like oh and have the ants go all over the fucking studio I'm gonna be fucked Yes, oh yeah, that would be real fun
[13:30.50]If you have fun with it, don't send me any fucked up shit.
[13:33.77]What do you mean, don't send me?
[13:36.31]I'm buying these things through the Kim, the proxy.
[13:41.35]And then she's gonna wrap them, and I'm not allowed to see them.
[13:47.91]Do you not trust us mods?
[13:49.11]No, of course I do.
[13:53.84]Alright, with that being said, let's move on.
[13:57.48]Hopefully you got enough information there.
[14:01.22]I don't trust the mods.
[14:11.18]Thank you KXE for the 30 bucks.
[14:12.67]Oh shit, EU Jerma stream.
[14:14.25]Excellent way to celebrate turning 30.
[14:15.53]Hope you have a Merry Christmas, friend.
[14:18.45]Hashtag charity.
[14:20.81]Uh... Happy 30.
[14:21.95]That's a big number.
[14:24.85]That's a big milestone to get over.
[14:27.85]And thank you for the $30.
[14:34.75]Now, I've been stalling, uh, enough, because this game beat the absolute shit out of me.
[14:43.83]I'm not... I think I felt... I think I felt worse.
[14:48.16]Yeah, I'm not sure.
[14:51.04]I may have, like, felt worse after being mad at Hotline Miami 2 than I was after seven vials of blood being removed from my body yesterday.
[14:59.74]I don't know which made me feel more uncomfortable.
[15:02.06]I don't know.
[15:02.74]That's a tough one.
[15:14.93]What song is this?
[15:15.79]Uh, I'm actually not sure.
[15:21.03]Buy more blood.
[15:22.71]Bloodborne gamer?
[15:23.69]No, not blood.
[15:25.43]I had a lot of blood work done yesterday.
[15:27.60]Alright, so we're gonna go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[15:29.78]Uh, where were we?
[15:30.18]We were at number 20?
[15:32.30]Release.
[15:41.64]I wish I could drink Jerma's blood.
[15:45.92]Um... I wish you wouldn't.
[15:49.04]I wish that you wouldn't do that.
[15:52.41]Why did I read that?
[15:54.19]Alright, I gotta be, like, calm and collected.
[15:56.63]I gotta be ready and I'm gonna complete this.
[16:01.31]I was very, very upset.
[16:03.31]And this music is very loud.
[16:08.30]Okay, hold on.
[16:08.88]This is distracting me already.
[16:14.41]no that's alright okay here we go I think I remember yeah I remember this part this guy chases you around I have why did I have to start at the very beginning here all my muscle memory is gone too this is gonna be a disaster this is gonna be a disaster I already know
[16:45.13]Alright, I got it.
[16:48.95]We're good.
[16:50.23]What happened to the... What's with the audio?
[16:55.15]What the heck happened to the audio?
[16:59.08]Alright, now I remember this part.
[17:00.36]You walk through here and I'm gonna die right now because I don't remember.
[17:03.34]No, I do.
[17:07.38]Oh, that guy has a gun.
[17:08.10]Alright.
[17:10.50]Oh boy.
[17:14.07]Now that's one, two, three, four.
[17:16.11]Windows everywhere.
[17:19.53]Like I have a gun?
[17:22.20]That guy's got a gun.
[17:23.10]Two guys with guns.
[17:30.84]Anybody?
[17:31.26]Who else?
[17:31.72]That guy?
[17:32.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:33.06]Alright, I gotta watch out.
[17:35.15]Oh god.
[17:37.03]Why is he not coming after me?
[17:40.29]Why is that guy not coming after me?
[17:43.12]He just shot me and didn't care.
[17:50.25]Somebody please come after me.
[17:51.99]I don't want to go in those rooms.
[17:53.35]It's just death.
[17:58.65]What the fuck?
[17:59.68]Why won't he come out here?
[18:07.06]He did come out here.
[18:07.68]Okay, he came out that time.
[18:14.72]Is he not?
[18:15.14]Okay, what about this guy in there?
[18:16.46]I wonder if I can hit this door and throw it at this guy.
[18:19.58]That's what I'm gonna try to do.
[18:23.62]Okay, I'm gonna knock that guy out of the door, throw a crowbar at this guy's face, break that guy's neck, shoot him in the face, and then throw the... I don't even know.
[18:29.36]I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[18:32.74]Perfect.
[18:33.24]Okay, I did it.
[18:34.04]But what did I do?
[18:34.52]Is there anybody else?
[18:41.20]I think I got that guy in there already.
[18:44.11]Okay.
[18:49.54]Damn it!
[18:50.12]I wasn't trying- I was trying to hit that guy.
[18:51.72]Fuck!
[18:54.22]I was trying to hit the guy with- the guy with the fucking gun.
[18:58.02]Not this dumbass.
[19:03.91]Good, come out here.
[19:06.69]Alright.
[19:07.81]That's the only guy with the gun.
[19:09.03]These guys have to wear both those too.
[19:10.25]Can I pull them?
[19:10.93]Whoa!
[19:11.55]Oh god.
[19:12.87]That was so many of them.
[19:14.39]I gotta throw this thing down.
[19:25.96]You know another thing I don't like about this place?
[19:27.74]It's like the lighting.
[19:30.54]The fact that it gets like that dark and then the red.
[19:32.64]Alright.
[19:35.38]Get over here.
[19:35.76]Fuck.
[19:46.91]Dear lord.
[19:47.91]Okay.
[19:50.20]Pull this guy out here.
[20:07.60]Go up.
[20:14.63]Come on!
[20:15.05]Why are you not chasing after me?
[20:16.53]Shouldn't he be running out here?
[20:26.51]Oh god!
[20:27.00]Okay.
[20:31.98]Just gotta deal with this guy.
[20:33.04]And then I get a gun and we can do it again.
[20:37.49]Alright.
[20:38.69]Here we go.
[20:39.47]Don't fuck it up.
[20:40.35]Come on, Jeremy.
[20:40.94]Don't fuck this up.
[20:41.72]Wait.
[20:41.98]Somebody has a gun.
[20:44.36]Somebody has a gun.
[20:45.26]Give me that gun.
[20:52.96]What?
[20:53.24]He doesn't hear that?
[20:53.78]There's a guy with a pistol.
[20:57.69]There he is.
[21:00.35]Okay.
[21:01.09]Here we go.
[21:02.59]He can shoot me through the walls, but so can I.
[21:05.59]Bingo.
[21:06.35]Give me the new gun.
[21:07.83]Nobody else, right?
[21:10.04]I'm so paranoid.
[21:17.64]You know, it would be nice... Why did that take so long?
[21:20.53]Okay.
[21:24.23]No gun?
[21:25.99]Gun, gun, gun.
[21:37.31]One guy left, that's it.
[21:38.95]Please.
[21:41.99]Please have this be the last guy on this floor.
[21:44.71]I can't see all the way up there, though.
[21:46.07]I think it is.
[21:46.48]I'm going for it.
[21:50.26]Holy shit, I just got so scared.
[21:51.42]I thought there was a guy right there, but it was a fucking plant.
[21:53.44]Okay, here we go.
[21:57.56]Got it.
[21:59.87]He's back, baby!
[22:19.95]Give me the gun!
[22:20.91]Give me the gun!
[22:27.45]This is so sloppy!
[22:30.49]I gotta put- Get this fucking gun out of here, man.
[22:50.98]Fuck No, well, I didn't I wanted to shoot you oh
[23:00.03]I'm so confused here.
[23:01.65]Am I, like, picking up the gun without right-clicking?
[23:05.10]Hold on a second.
[23:05.74]I'm really confused.
[23:09.02]I'm running over this gun, and it's picking up.
[23:14.22]Like, I'm not hitting right-click.
[23:17.21]Am I out of my mind?
[23:20.59]Oh boy, alright.
[23:21.59]What do we got?
[23:22.01]Fuck.
[23:25.87]Okay.
[23:34.24]I think I'm just gonna... Got it.
[23:38.01]Okay.
[23:38.63]Now, wait for this one guy.
[23:40.09]Give me this gun, please.
[23:44.33]That one, I think.
[23:48.58]Who's left?
[23:49.44]Alright, we got a ton of people down there.
[23:51.34]Gun.
[23:52.64]Got it.
[23:52.88]Anybody else?

[24:18.79]WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT UGGGHHH.
[24:21.79]I told myself today. Listen guys.
[24:40.15]I said I was going to be cautious.
[24:41.49]I was not going to freak out.
[24:42.85]I was going to be very, very collected today.
[24:45.34]I think so far I've been okay.
[24:50.12]You know what I'm saying?
[24:52.56]What are you guys thinking?
[24:53.42]I've been pretty calm and collected.
[24:55.43]Tons of... Oh, I didn't want to shoot you.
[24:59.75]I just accidentally shot that guy.
[25:01.07]Alright, give me another gun.
[25:01.87]There's no other guns here.
[25:06.57]Sir, could you...
[25:10.56]There's another gun.
[25:12.34]Alright.
[25:15.09]Right, what's happening?
[25:18.52]What?
[25:18.76]I don't understand why I don't... Jeremy, don't do it.
[25:22.10]But I don't understand why.
[25:23.04]I don't understand... I don't understand why it was locked on and I couldn't get the lock on to come back.
[25:30.18]I don't... I don't understand.
[25:31.76]I'm infuriated right now.
[25:33.49]Stop it.
[25:34.29]It's alright.
[25:34.73]Everything's gonna be fine.
[25:35.79]Just pick up the gun on the ground.
[25:37.49]Don't worry about it.
[25:38.31]It's... Just think about it.
[25:39.13]It's like Christmas time.
[25:39.99]You know what I mean?
[25:40.41]Like, isn't that nice?
[25:46.84]Christmas is fucking nice.
[25:49.14]The holidays are here.
[25:50.18]You know?
[25:58.38]I didn't get more than one.
[26:01.74]He's dead?
[26:07.19]Alright.
[26:08.41]There's people down there and that door is open.
[26:12.43]So I gotta get in here.
[26:13.15]I gotta shoot one guy.
[26:14.21]Like I got a gun?
[26:20.07]I just fucking panicked.
[26:25.25]What the hell are you doing, Jeremy?
[26:28.78]What have I done?
[26:29.24]It's ruined.
[26:34.48]No, it's not.
[26:34.96]I got a gun right here.
[26:38.16]Fucking door!
[26:42.04]Alright, it's just this guy with this pistol.
[26:43.76]I'm gonna go down here.
[26:44.63]I'm safe.
[26:47.06]That's it, okay?
[26:48.30]Just wait for... That guy's dead in that room.
[26:59.75]Okay, one bullet.
[27:02.07]No, it's too risky.
[27:05.32]Uh, give me something else.
[27:08.04]It's too risky.
[27:12.74]Told you it was risky.
[27:16.06]Nobody else is alive.
[27:18.04]Come on.
[27:18.30]I was told this is like the hardest level in the game That's what my horoscope said this morning That's it
[27:46.63]Oh, I almost died.
[27:47.43]Okay.
[27:48.27]Get changed.
[27:53.05]This level is where I quit for six months.
[27:58.57]Six months.
[28:00.21]That's a long time.
[28:05.66]Who the hell is this guy?
[28:06.48]Does this guy duck?
[28:07.48]What?
[28:07.68]I... I don't understand this guy.
[28:13.48]He ducked.
[28:17.67]What?
[28:19.15]What am I supposed to do about this guy?
[28:24.04]I guess just avoid him?
[28:30.42]Okay.
[28:31.04]What do I do about the duck guy?
[28:33.86]There's a bunch of duck guys.
[28:35.30]Melee?
[28:43.25]Huh.
[28:48.02]Well, there's a melee here.
[28:50.14]Let's see if this theory works.
[28:54.30]Ooh, alright.
[28:55.76]So they... I can't shoot these guys.
[29:01.20]Oh my god, he's running so fast!
[29:03.22]Oh, I didn't know the... Holy fuck.
[29:12.18]I like how... I need to, like, crack my fingers for a second.
[29:15.04]They, like, hurt my chest.
[29:20.27]I could use, uh... Come on, get over here.
[29:25.77]He didn't see me?
[29:26.59]This guy's gonna see me.
[29:27.27]Give me a gun!
[29:37.54]What the fuck?
[29:38.88]What just happened?
[29:40.18]I went through every single window and didn't hit anybody.

[30:22.11]Just pull this guy out.
[30:25.62]That guy can see through here.

[32:25.73]Oh, that made... Like, why... Why are you doing that when you have a gun?
[32:31.29]Is there a reason for that?
[32:32.57]That made me extremely upset.
[32:34.74]I'm upset right now.
[32:35.60]You're just gonna sit there and pound on his face and you just have a shotgun in your pocket.
[32:50.70]Nope, I didn't have any bullets.
[32:58.12]Taking the gun with me.
[33:08.85]That guy's got a gun.

[33:21.75]I need that one shot here for him.
[33:24.73]Alright.

[33:46.03]Mmm.
[33:46.93]No, I don't.
[33:49.32]Huh, okay.

[33:52.54]Alright, here we go.
[33:56.76]Knife this guy right in the face?
[33:58.16]No, knife this guy right in the face.
[34:01.52]Wait, there's a pistol?
[34:02.38]Pistol?
[34:02.72]Does it have bullets?
[34:06.54]Did I... Oh, there it is.
[34:09.55]You know, what would I do without you guys?
[34:11.51]What would I do without you guys?
[34:15.53]What the hell would I even do without you?
[34:18.70]What?
[34:21.02]I'm pan- What happened?
[34:23.00]What?
[34:23.18]That's not a door.
[34:23.98]What?
[34:24.40]Why did this not open?
[34:26.16]What?
[34:28.64]What?
[34:30.42]Why did the door not- I walked right into it.
[34:34.03]I don't understand.
[34:35.67]What the fuck did I just do?
[34:37.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[34:38.03]What?
[34:41.17]What the fuck did I just do?
[34:42.19]Did I just go back?
[34:43.84]I just pre- No fucking way.
[34:50.05]You gotta be kidding me.
[34:52.33]Really?
[34:53.39]That that just actually happened?
[34:55.49]When you're in the middle of a level, it's that easy to go all the way to the beginning?
[35:01.92]No way.
[35:05.80]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[35:12.83]What?
[35:16.03]Not even like a confirmation, right?
[35:18.15]What?
[35:18.87]It's just like, now you're at the beginning again.
[35:21.33]What?
[35:22.27]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[35:23.53]I can't believe it.
[35:27.86]That was like on floor three or four.
[35:29.74]If I was on the first floor, I would understand.
[35:31.46]But why?
[35:41.40]There's no way to undo that.
[35:51.48]And why did the music get so quiet?
[35:59.97]Uh, yeah, I... I guess I just accidentally restarted the entire thing.
[36:06.01]Now I gotta do this all over again.
[36:10.49]What the fuck?
[36:17.64]Um...
[36:28.17]Uh, okay.
[36:29.03]Oh, well.
[36:31.54]I think I'm so upset by that, that I, like, I don't even know what to do.
[36:35.72]I'm gonna do it again.
[36:36.98]But I'm... I'm so, like, annoyed by what just happened that I can't even give you a reaction.
[36:42.96]And I'm just gonna play.
[36:44.03]Let's go.
[36:45.15]Base cam?
[36:45.61]Alright, fine.
[37:02.79]End of the stream, boys.
[37:03.83]Somebody wrote, I would quit for six months over that.
[37:09.51]No, I'm alright, though.
[37:12.02]I figured these levels out before.
[37:14.96]Just don't get so upset that you can't... I just have no emotion right now.
[37:20.02]This guy with gun... What else is over here?
[37:24.19]Give me another weapon.
[37:32.87]I got to be ready for this.
[37:33.97]I'm going to pull people into the bathroom.
[37:36.37]I didn't even know there was a way to go in there.
[37:38.01]Oh, come on.
[37:40.36]I didn't even know there was a way to go down there.
[37:43.00]Why did it rewind?
[37:44.50]No, it's coming out.
[37:45.74]Why did it rewind all the way without a confirmation?
[37:48.88]What's with the confirmation?
[37:50.50]No confirmation.
[38:03.98]God, I can't believe it.
[38:05.86]I can't fucking believe it.
[38:08.94]Oh, no, I can't.
[38:09.70]Just relax.
[38:10.28]I didn't even know they could go through there.
[38:25.39]Get in here, you... I already did this.
[38:35.18]Stop it.
[38:35.68]Just do it.
[38:39.71]Just... I can't fucking... Why would that even be an option?
[39:10.02]I'm so fucking mad.
[39:13.92]I need to relax, man.
[39:15.02]I seriously need to re- I need to relax.
[39:20.28]I'm gonna, like, eat my microphone.
[39:22.54]But I might not sound that upset.
[39:25.17]But deep down inside of, like, my fucking veins.
[39:31.33]This is like when the evil villain is so dangerous and so terrifying and somebody makes fun of him or slights him.
[39:39.85]And he doesn't look upset.
[39:41.89]He's very collected, and he's just sitting there like, Oh, yes.
[39:45.78]Wasn't that an interesting thing you said?
[39:48.50]And he's so collected about it, but deep down, you know.
[39:52.10]You know what he's planning.
[39:56.58]He's planning to eat his microphone when he goes home.
[40:02.16]That guy doesn't have a gun.
[40:06.86]I don't want him to see me.
[40:07.68]Alright, let's... I gotta run up on this guy and get him.
[40:12.20]Run up on him and get him.
[40:13.01]I can, right?
[40:13.63]I know I can.
[40:16.27]Give me that gun.
[40:17.99]Alright.
[40:19.17]It's time.
[40:20.73]Two guns.
[40:22.91]No, I'm not gonna do this yet.
[40:24.15]Yes, I am.
[40:26.18]I already did it.
[40:34.42]Okay, I got it with one shot.
[40:37.28]Thank you.
[40:37.86]It's that easy.
[40:38.80]We're fine.
[40:40.02]Oh, fuck.
[40:40.42]That's still going.
[40:44.35]I still have to do this whole thing again, too.
[40:58.78]I think that when I know that I... I'm just fucking angry.
[41:05.83]And it's making me play at a level that I've never even seen before.
[41:08.55]Okay.
[41:09.37]So, we're good.
[41:12.73]Two guys up there with a gun.
[41:13.95]Anybody down there?
[41:14.89]I don't think there is.
[41:17.65]Nope.
[41:19.35]Gun, gun.
[41:20.09]Let's go ahead and pull.
[41:30.38]Of course that guy's still alive.
[41:31.48]Give me a break.
[41:46.85]That guy hit himself in the fucking head with the door.
[41:52.60]I don't like this shotgun.
[41:54.32]I seriously don't like this shotgun at all.
[41:58.20]It just causes fucking problems.
[42:08.75]Alright.
[42:11.27]Give me...
[42:16.98]Got them both.
[42:17.84]Yes!
[42:26.50]That guy can probably see me.
[42:27.36]Does that guy have line of sight on me?
[42:29.04]Alright, only guy with the gun right here.
[42:36.53]Oh boy.
[42:37.09]Woohoohoohoohoo!
[42:43.27]Alright, give me this one.
[42:45.38]Very close to being exactly where we were and deleted a bunch of fucking time for no reason.
[42:49.58]Wiser rewind!
[42:56.24]Give me that.
[43:02.27]Alright, these guys both have- that guy has a gun.
[43:04.07]That guy up there has a gun.
[43:05.31]Did I get the guy over here?
[43:06.61]It was two, right?
[43:07.45]This guy in the bathroom.
[43:08.25]Alright, I'm gonna say I'm going bathroom.
[43:13.56]Oh my fucking god, what have I done?
[43:15.42]I saw the guy behind me.
[43:17.90]Oh my fucking god.
[43:21.05]I can't, I don't, I did it already.
[44:00.08]That's it up there.
[44:00.72]Okay.
[44:01.84]Give me the pistol.
[44:08.62]No, fuck the pistol.
[44:11.02]Explain it.
[44:12.32]I want a full written report of what happened there.
[44:15.46]Alright, now we got these two.
[44:17.23]Didn't hear that, I guess.
[44:18.39]Fine!
[44:22.59]You fucking can't be serious.
[44:25.95]Oh my fucking god.
[44:34.66]I can't fucking believe it.
[44:46.09]Just give me a weapon.
[44:47.43]Any of them that have bullets.
[44:57.64]Is he dead?
[44:58.76]Did the door hit him or is he dead?
[45:01.50]I don't know.
[45:02.32]I think he's dead.
[45:06.99]I have the gun right here.
[45:10.15]I'm trying to fucking shoot the guy behind him.
[45:12.41]What the f- why?
[45:15.11]He knocked him down, and I still shot him with the shotgun, and he absorbed every single fucking pellet.
[45:25.26]Just never forget, never forget, that I pressed enter on this.
[45:31.10]And...
[45:50.40]Almost did it again.
[45:54.18]Press R to reload.
[45:55.46]Can I pick, please?
[46:08.67]Anything, please?
[46:12.53]Can you just go back to pick a chapter?
[46:13.85]No, it starts at the very beginning.
[46:26.72]Dammit.
[46:27.92]These guys- That guy has a gun.
[46:37.65]What the fuck was that?
[46:39.09]Alright, I need something here.
[46:40.15]Alright, this time I can't let that happen again.
[46:43.23]I gotta get back to where I just was.
[46:44.73]I don't think any of these have... No.
[46:54.08]No bullets at all.
[46:54.94]I'm in trouble.
[47:02.16]I guess I could throw... Nobody has a gun over here.
[47:04.30]Yeah, they do.
[47:04.68]Shit.
[47:05.04]I have to pull this guy in here.
[47:09.05]Give me your gun.
[47:21.78]Okay.
[47:22.68]Can we please try this again?
[47:24.05]Without, like, a total disaster.
[47:35.77]Alright.
[47:37.43]How did I even get shot by that guy?
[47:39.15]This guy was... What the heck happened?
[47:42.89]Alright.
[47:44.77]It's crunch time here.
[47:45.69]Get it done.
[47:46.71]For the love of God.
[47:47.69]That killed that guy last.
[47:49.53]Because there's two... There's a pistol in the ground there.
[47:54.20]Nobody has line of sight.
[47:57.40]Alright, here we go.
[48:00.10]I gotta make this happen.
[48:03.57]What the fuck is you doing over here?
[48:05.23]What are you doing over here?
[48:06.77]What do you think you're doing over here?
[48:18.49]What are you doing over here?
[48:21.87]Alright, finally.
[48:24.17]Don't press escape ever again.
[48:28.82]My heart is racing right now.
[48:30.90]No, I already did this too, didn't I?
[48:32.71]Did I already?
[48:33.21]Where is my fucking character?
[48:34.29]What the heck?
[48:37.03]What?
[48:37.41]Alright.
[48:39.40]But by the way, when I press R, why doesn't R go now?
[48:58.64]Who's left?
[48:59.22]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[49:00.58]Wasn't there somebody up here?
[49:07.85]I got like collapsed on by somebody before.
[49:09.47]This guy.
[49:10.13]I need a melee.
[49:19.31]That's it, right?
[49:20.09]Somebody else ran after me before.
[49:21.57]I remember distinctly.
[49:27.86]Somebody came after me.
[49:29.10]I need to get a melee.
[49:30.21]Give me a reliable melee.
[49:41.95]I don't even know who's down there.
[49:47.11]Nobody has a gun.
[49:47.97]That guy.
[49:48.91]Oh, I knew I saw.
[49:49.83]I knew he was coming.
[49:51.63]This guy has a gun.
[49:56.09]Nobody in this room.
[49:56.95]Just this guy here.
[49:57.69]Come on.
[49:58.23]You can see me.
[49:58.75]Get over here.
[50:00.85]How do you not see me?
[50:07.75]Jesus, man.
[50:09.69]Don't go in there.
[50:11.34]Don't go in there.
[50:11.98]Just wait.
[50:16.64]Fuck.
[50:20.50]Come on.
[50:21.68]I don't want to go in there yet.
[50:24.34]Oh, you almost did it.
[50:27.57]He almost did it to me.
[50:35.51]Last guy.
[50:38.34]Now we're back.
[50:41.78]Kill them.
[50:42.44]I know.
[50:42.92]I'm trying.
[50:43.58]It's just very nerve-wracking.
[50:48.38]This is where I was before.
[50:49.44]No?
[50:50.60]Actually, I kind of like that strategy.
[51:00.91]You stupid door!
[51:02.69]It has to be the same color as everything else!
[51:08.41]I liked that strategy before it was a fucking terrible strategy.
[51:26.46]Fucking guy!
[51:28.68]I thought it was a fat guy.
[51:35.29]Fucking god again.
[51:38.57]Where's the fucking sprint guy?
[51:39.99]I clicked th- I right clicked three times to try to pick that up and it didn't pick it up until like the fourth one.
[51:52.66]Why?
[52:03.14]I- Seriously, he just fucking like insta-teleported around the corner.
[52:16.27]I need that gun.
[52:18.75]What the fuck?
[52:27.44]Alright, can you not like fucking hitbox me from five feet away?
[52:36.27]Same thing up here.
[52:42.19]Where's the guy?
[52:42.99]He's right up here somewhere, right?
[52:46.48]Jesus game, come on.
[52:57.98]Alright, we got one, two, a guy with a gun.
[53:01.17]I'm gonna melee over here.
[53:02.81]Is this a toothbrush?
[53:05.71]Bring this gun a little closer because I know for a fact I'm gonna fuck it up and need it.
[53:13.67]What the hell?
[53:14.37]What the hell?
[53:14.71]Where's the gun?
[53:15.49]Oh, what happened to the gun?
[53:21.34]I threw it up here.
[53:22.46]I'm gonna shoot this guy from over here.
[53:30.64]Is that guy alive to the right?
[53:32.26]I think he is.
[53:33.68]Is he?
[53:34.44]He's not moving.
[53:39.24]Is this guy alive right here?
[53:41.20]He is.
[53:42.88]It's one of these idiots.
[53:43.62]Okay, gun.
[53:59.61]Fucking bird noise.
[54:01.63]Alright, I gotta be very careful here.
[54:03.23]This too- this too much can go wrong.
[54:05.21]Don't do it yet.
[54:13.21]Okay.
[54:15.83]Got it.
[54:19.35]Last guy.
[54:19.77]This guy has a gun.
[54:27.02]Yes!
[54:32.86]Escape.
[54:33.34]No, it's not over.
[54:37.47]Don't have a- I don't have a guy come over to me.
[54:39.81]It'd kill me.
[54:41.87]Oh, okay.
[54:42.39]We've got this.
[54:43.19]We're evacuating.
[54:44.03]Go get yourself out of here.
[54:49.54]I'm just kidding.
[54:50.02]I'm not gonna press fucking reset.
[54:56.58]Oh, boy.
[54:57.06]Hey.
[54:59.70]I still got it.
[55:01.44]I might have failed that level, though.
[55:03.62]It depends.
[55:09.94]Not even a confirmation.
[55:10.86]What do you think, D?
[55:14.79]That's alright.
[55:17.37]C-.
[55:20.77]I got a better score because I rewound.
[55:26.73]After that, well, there's not a whole lot more to tell.
[55:29.63]If I may ask, where did you go after you escaped?
[55:33.35]I guess I might as well tell you I went to Hawaii.
[55:35.91]You see, that's why I need you to get me a plane ticket.
[55:38.59]By the way, those of you guys that are watching, this is like 80% of the way through the game.
[55:44.77]This is not like Hotline Miami 2 Part 1.
[55:47.82]We played this a couple days ago.
[55:49.06]I'm just finishing it up.
[55:50.78]Gonna play it until it's done.
[55:53.12]And there you go.
[55:54.84]Spoiler if you've never seen the game.
[55:58.82]This is not level 1.
[56:01.26]You see, that's why I need you to get me a plane ticket.
[56:04.08]It's not for me, it's for my mother.
[56:05.93]I'm really worried about her.
[56:06.93]She can't take care of herself.
[56:09.79]I was hoping you could get her to come here.
[56:11.25]I understand I'm going to have to check my bank account.
[56:15.69]I'll get the money for it one way or another, okay?
[56:18.38]Wouldn't be right otherwise.
[56:20.94]I don't think you understand how much of a help you've been.
[56:28.60]By the way, those of you that are just joining us now, I want to make sure I make this very clear.
[56:31.70]We talked about it.
[56:32.26]Let's talk about it for like a couple minutes right now.
[56:35.64]Christmas Eve is going to be a stream.
[56:38.36]And you, yes, you are going to be involved if you want.
[56:43.04]There's a channel in the Discord right now that is designed for you to give suggestions of what you'd like to buy me for Christmas.
[56:51.53]And it's going to be secret.
[56:52.43]I'm not going to know what they are.
[56:54.03]It's going to be secretly purchased.
[56:56.39]You don't have to buy anything.
[56:57.68]Yeah, I'm going to buy it through a proxy.
[57:01.20]So I will not know what it is and they're going to be wrapped and I'm going to open them on stream on Christmas Eve.
[57:08.70]That is what's happening.
[57:10.65]Your suggestions have to be an Amazon link and they have to be Prime shippable.
[57:16.85]Otherwise, I will not be able to get them in time.
[57:19.86]Has to be Amazon, has to be Prime Shippable.
[57:23.03]Shippable.
[57:24.07]Shippable.
[57:25.55]There's too many P's in that word.
[57:33.01]And your suggestions have to be between $0 and $50, no more than that.
[57:40.23]Maximum budget that's allowed is 50 bucks.
[57:44.15]And the mods are going to take this from the suggestions.
[57:46.91]And I come up with a Christmas list.
[57:49.55]And that's one of the things we're going to be doing on Christmas Eve.
[57:56.00]Zero dollars.
[57:59.30]Dear Evan, I haven't heard from you in a while.
[58:01.94]I miss you.
[58:02.30]The kids miss you too.
[58:03.10]I think we can still make this work, but I can't live with a man who puts his job before his family.
[58:08.32]I still love you.
[58:09.10]You know I do.
[58:09.60]I hope you love me too.
[58:11.58]Please call me when you read this.
[58:13.57]Sharon.
[58:13.91]$49.99 or $50?
[58:17.15]Like 50.
[58:17.31]Five zero dot space zero zero zero.
[58:28.55]Why are there multiple things to look at here?
[58:29.95]Hold on.
[58:37.87]Wait, what?
[58:39.07]Act 6, Catastrophe.
[58:44.59]Did I just go... Am I writing a story right now?
[58:49.50]You wanted to see me, boss.
[58:51.82]Yeah, we've got things to do tonight.
[58:54.56]Like what?
[58:56.31]You know the strip club on 77th?
[58:57.83]It's opening up tomorrow.
[58:59.93]Ah, so.
[59:01.29]The Colombians, they own the place.
[59:03.12]They're having an opening party tonight.
[59:04.86]VIPs only.
[59:05.78]Let you find out.
[59:08.02]How do you think they invited me?
[59:11.74]Bring your guns.
[59:12.38]We're going to make sure they have a fun party.
[59:14.76]You want to start a war with the Colombians?
[59:17.02]Is that really a good idea?
[59:18.06]We've got a lot more people than we do.
[59:20.93]After my father died, they went in and stole our territory, our business.
[59:24.09]You think I'm just going to let that slide?
[59:26.11]This is really a good time for it.
[59:28.01]There's not going to be a better time while we wait.
[59:29.93]They keep expanding.
[59:31.61]Now, who's the boss here?
[59:32.51]You or me?
[59:33.11]You got any more objections?
[59:35.31]You're the boss.
[59:36.17]I'll do whatever you tell me.
[59:38.31]Alright, then let's go.
[59:38.93]So now I play as this guy.
[59:47.88]You guys know that machine that you punch and it tells you like how many pounds per square inch your punches are?
[59:55.79]I can get that thing over like 700 or 800.
[59:57.55]I can almost get that thing to... I can almost max that thing out at 999.
[60:07.32]Stop changing characters.
[60:08.48]I have no control over it.
[60:11.86]Yeah, okay.
[60:12.62]Sure.
[60:13.20]I'll prove it.
[60:14.70]Next time I'm available and I'm in front of one of those things, I'm going to hit that thing over 100 pounds per square inch.
[60:20.85]I impress people all the time.
[60:22.07]They go, holy shit, man.
[60:24.01]It's my turn.
[60:24.91]They're like, ugh, like 620.
[60:26.57]And I'm like, oh, wow, that was pretty good.
[60:29.55]You know, another guy goes up.
[60:30.97]Like, ugh, wow, 540.
[60:33.21]That's a lot, dude.
[60:33.99]That's a fucking shitload.
[60:34.89]Good for you.
[60:36.68]Somebody else comes up and spins around, runs across the room, sprinting, and then they punch as hard as they can, like, seven.
[60:42.91]Seven hundred.
[60:44.33]And the whole place fucking screams, and I just, like, crack my neck a little bit.
[60:47.37]I'm like, let me try.
[60:48.89]I'll try.
[60:49.31]It sounds like fun.
[60:51.58]I get up there, and I fucking destroy this thing, and the thing goes like... I think people just, their jaws drop, because I do an 800 fucking pound per square inch punch.
[61:06.10]I know I can do it.
[61:07.08]And I'm just letting them all have like their moment with their like 600 pounds per square inch punches.
[61:12.86]And I let them have it.
[61:13.66]And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[61:15.00]And then I get up there and come on.
[61:22.85]I'm telling you, this is real.
[61:26.49]I'll do it.
[61:28.07]You want to see like how ferocious of a person I am?
[61:33.21]The next time one of those is around, I'm gonna have somebody videotape me doing it.
[61:39.59]21st scene.
[61:39.95]This is called... uh, Sru?
[61:43.65]What was it called?
[61:44.37]I didn't- I saw it for one second.
[61:46.85]Roll dodge.
[61:48.11]That's all I have.
[61:52.35]Oh, seizure.
[61:53.25]Okay.
[61:57.11]I can't pick anything else?
[62:01.19]I don't want to dodge roll.
[62:02.39]Alright, let's go.
[62:02.97]Why did I not hit that guy for?
[62:13.16]Ooh, okay.
[62:13.96]Alright, alright, alright.
[62:21.66]Pretty good line of sight on me right here.
[62:22.92]Come on.
[62:26.32]Windows.
[62:27.56]I didn't know those were windows.
[62:30.42]I didn't see them.
[62:34.81]So we gotta pull this guy through here.
[62:37.93]God, it's so dark.
[62:42.37]Come on, where are you?
[62:42.93]Alright.
[62:53.54]Here we go, here comes two other guys, alright.
[62:57.48]Pistol right there, this is a problem.
[62:59.12]Let's see if I can pull him.
[62:59.98]Alright.
[63:08.08]That guy's just dancing over there.
[63:10.32]I need to light up again so I can see.
[63:15.87]Turn it up?
[63:18.69]Right.
[63:19.21]Alright.
[63:19.67]You get one piece of Pez.
[63:20.95]Let's go with this.
[63:24.47]I can't tell.
[63:25.13]Is anybody else?
[63:25.71]There's a guy right here.
[63:27.22]Well.
[63:28.24]Where'd he go?
[63:32.90]Where did that guy go?
[63:35.60]God damn it.
[63:36.26]Alright.
[63:36.54]Well.
[63:40.42]I'm just gonna go in here and shoot these guys, I guess.
[63:42.40]Right?
[63:42.68]I don't know.
[63:43.02]I can't... Mmm, that guy's a window.
[63:44.63]That's it up here.
[63:52.03]I'm just gonna keep going.
[63:56.79]What the fuck?
[63:57.79]Ugh.
[63:59.11]That patrol took so long for him to get down here.
[64:02.15]Where the hell was that guy?
[64:21.12]Alright.
[64:22.41]Again, we've got these two guys.
[64:25.83]Got a knife.
[64:26.63]Pull him over here.
[64:32.82]Why are you like this?
[64:36.90]What?
[64:37.16]Am I missing something here?
[64:38.36]Am I missing something here?
[64:51.72]What the hell is this guy?
[64:52.58]Why can I not... Okay, that was weird.
[65:03.19]That patrol.
[65:03.95]Didn't get him.
[65:31.02]Last guy, there he is.
[65:34.21]What?
[65:37.13]What happened?
[65:37.65]What?
[65:37.93]Where?
[65:38.59]What?
[65:43.71]How did I?
[65:43.99]What killed me?
[65:53.04]There's a guy in a bush.
[65:56.92]Why am I fucking not surprised?
[66:18.47]Alright, I gotta shoot this guy.
[66:26.03]I just took the guy's head off.
[66:27.51]Alright, again, I can't see anything on the ground.
[66:30.61]I guess there's a gun here.
[66:33.55]Alright, watch out for guy in the bush.
[66:37.74]That's great.
[66:41.28]I love everything about that.
[66:42.44]Fucking asshole.
[66:48.84]Alright, let's go.
[66:49.78]I have a choice, apparently.
[66:51.04]I can't go that way.
[66:58.57]Ow.
[67:00.69]Ow.
[67:04.03]Ow.
[67:06.53]Ow.
[67:06.87]He came out this time.
[67:15.83]Well, well.
[67:16.96]Okay.
[67:17.12]Okay.
[67:25.10]I'm gonna miss somebody, and I'm not gonna even see them.
[67:28.82]I guarantee that.
[67:34.43]Someone's gonna be, like, hiding in a sofa.
[67:36.37]And they're gonna shoot me.
[67:53.81]Dog.
[67:54.43]Don't let me forget about the dog.
[67:56.57]I will forget about that fucking dog.
[67:57.87]Is he still alive?
[68:04.70]What?
[68:06.36]Huh?
[68:09.24]Huh?
[68:09.78]Huh?
[68:10.80]Why am I... Stop doing that.
[68:13.80]Huh?
[68:14.26]Why am I making that fucking noise?
[68:15.66]Relax.
[68:16.68]Dog!
[68:18.06]Dog!
[68:24.03]Who's left?
[68:24.89]I don't know.
[68:28.01]Maybe the one with 20.
[68:30.45]Alright, we got a guy with a shotgun.
[68:31.89]I'm gonna keep this guy locked on because I know I'm gonna fuck this up.
[68:36.47]Told you.
[68:40.59]I just didn't even look.
[68:41.95]Hopefully I got somebody.
[68:46.54]What is a fucking door in the way?
[68:49.30]Mmmmm.
[68:57.22]Who is left?
[68:59.00]I'm so paranoid.
[69:00.20]Right here.
[69:00.86]Last guy?
[69:03.87]Yep.
[69:11.33]Uh... Okay.
[69:16.04]I guess I'm gonna go over here.
[69:24.98]Well, that... That was it.
[69:30.43]Apparently.
[69:32.79]Go to the car, but what about over here?
[69:34.31]I want to go up that way.
[69:39.39]Is it the same?
[69:39.83]No, it's the same thing.
[69:42.77]No, it's a different entrance.
[69:43.69]Okay, well.
[69:47.86]That wasn't hard enough for you?
[69:51.16]No, that was okay.
[69:51.94]That was fine.
[69:57.93]That was like a nice level.
[70:00.05]It was challenging, dark.
[70:17.46]Nice.
[70:18.86]Always a C. Alright, somebody tell me.
[70:24.58]I'm unlocking...
[70:31.01]I'm unlocking items that I'm... I thought that was a fucking, like... I thought that was a monster and those were eyes for a second.
[70:37.35]I was like, who's in, like, a different costume?
[70:38.81]I thought it was, like, a weird, like, bear costume.
[70:41.37]Whatever, let's just not pay attention to it.
[70:46.62]We sure did a number on those bastards, huh?
[70:50.28]Calls for a celebration, don't you think?
[70:51.52]I don't know, boss.
[70:54.82]That's what that is.
[70:55.46]It's not... There's no nudity here.
[70:57.32]Those are people in costumes.
[71:01.40]Those are just, like, eyes, and that's, like, a head, and they have, like, hats on.
[71:04.70]You know how I make, like, 40% of every Rumble character in the new 2K games?
[71:10.08]That's what it is.
[71:12.06]I don't know, boss.
[71:13.42]You don't know what the hell is that supposed to mean.
[71:19.97]I think I'm gonna head back home.
[71:21.19]I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
[71:23.67]And why is that?
[71:24.23]You've got all you need right here, don't you?
[71:29.54]I gotta get home to my girlfriend.
[71:30.90]Been a long day, you know?
[71:33.64]You guys see that fucking shark?
[71:36.52]Yeah, it's a pretty big shark.
[71:38.00]Boy, that girl's sure done a number on you, huh?
[71:40.48]You know, a real man doesn't need to rely on women to live his life.
[71:44.36]The minute you get attached, the same one you know you're fucked.
[71:47.02]Besides, that girl of yours is way too good for you.
[71:49.76]One day she will come to her senses, you know.
[71:54.80]Well, that's none of my business.
[71:55.90]Go on home if that's what you want.
[72:02.19]Alright, see you soon.
[72:04.33]Oh, before you go, I left a little something for you on the desk outside.
[72:07.73]Buy your girl something nice.
[72:08.85]I can't, like, smash this?
[72:19.40]What is it?
[72:20.64]Oh, nice, money!
[72:22.22]Thanks for the money.
[72:29.45]Oh, I can't go in the cool car?
[72:38.48]I let the door open?
[72:40.30]It's alright.
[72:40.68]Alright boys, this is it.
[72:42.82]Tonight we'll be rich.
[72:43.82]We can do anything we want.
[72:45.93]The Colombians will have nothing left.
[72:47.35]They'll learn to fear us.
[72:48.97]Toast to our new lives as kings of the street.
[73:02.56]This kind of sounds like a cool Bowser theme song.
[73:07.16]From Mario & Luigi RPG games.
[73:20.09]Don't die on the third floor.
[73:21.57]Alright, I'll try not to.
[73:22.43]Am I supposed to be getting attacked here?
[73:36.70]If only we could hear it.
[73:37.70]You can hear it.
[73:43.35]Ah, guys.
[73:44.49]Oh.
[73:46.37]What an end.
[73:47.33]What an end to the arc.
[73:59.99]Ooh, there's guys right there.
[74:01.35]Let's see if we can spring something together here.
[74:08.96]Turn the mouse sensitivity down.
[74:10.02]It's fucking me up.
[74:22.77]Give me a new weapon.
[74:26.05]Ooh, boy.
[74:33.62]Come on up.
[74:35.94]Pistol, please.
[74:37.82]Alright, there's somebody, there's people down here.
[74:40.88]I'm gonna get lit up by this guy.
[74:45.84]No, okay.
[74:46.72]They don't have line of sight here?
[74:49.54]No, just, I'm checking to make sure they don't have, you know, hold on.
[74:52.50]What's the point of that?
[74:55.57]How did I miss?
[74:57.93]Alright, just this guy.
[74:58.67]What about down here?
[74:59.57]Nobody.
[74:59.95]Okay, got you.
[75:12.83]Pistol?
[75:14.13]I would like that.
[75:14.77]Fuck.
[75:25.82]I don't know.
[75:28.54]Knew it.
[75:30.78]Okay, we're good.
[75:41.09]Straight up.
[75:43.66]Okay, we've got... Ooh, I didn't mean to do that.
[75:50.58]Will?
[75:50.96]Okay.
[75:52.72]I feel like I have to stand here.
[75:57.69]Sensitivity, please.
[75:58.51]Alright, let me think about this.
[76:04.37]So, this guy's gonna get up.
[76:09.25]And then nobody... There's a... Watch out for the walls.
[76:11.69]I got a guy here.
[76:12.53]Way out!
[76:13.91]Whoa, why we?
[76:14.53]Oh, okay.
[76:15.79]Whatever.
[76:17.18]Who has sight on me?
[76:17.90]Somebody all the way up there?
[76:18.84]Fuck.
[76:21.78]Okay, I get it.
[76:26.48]Got him.
[76:26.84]Okay, I get you.
[76:28.66]Get you.
[76:29.16]Watch everybody come around the corner.
[76:31.61]That leaves you.
[76:33.49]You.
[76:33.75]You.
[76:39.75]And somebody else, I guess.
[76:41.44]You two.
[76:41.86]I need to make sure that none of you people up here are going to kill me like you.
[76:50.23]One, two, three.
[76:51.15]That it?
[77:01.37]No, a couple of guys left.
[77:03.53]Although, I want this gun.
[77:05.13]It's more reliable for me.
[77:07.33]What do we got?
[77:07.81]Let's see if I can get them both.
[77:11.63]Nope.
[77:12.44]I should still be able to get you, though.
[77:13.88]Oh, no, I did.
[77:14.32]I got him.
[77:14.56]I got him.
[77:17.54]Is it safe?
[77:19.26]That's the question.
[77:23.46]I think it's just this guy.
[77:24.90]Nobody else in this room?
[77:25.76]No hidden people?
[77:26.40]No bush?
[77:28.83]Almost guy in a bush.
[77:29.87]He was turning into a bush guy.
[77:33.07]I got him before he transformed.
[77:39.33]Do it before he gets up!
[77:45.37]Alright, we're good.
[77:45.81]Is that it?
[77:55.20]Oh no.
[77:56.22]There, got it.
[77:59.11]That should disable all the security doors.
[78:00.69]I heard about this guy, the Joker.
[78:04.64]Yeah, he's crazy.
[78:05.70]You hear how weird he is?
[78:07.16]Yes, I have heard about how weird he is.
[78:08.58]Whoops.
[78:21.73]Can...
[78:27.78]The Joker misses at the beginning of the movie.
[78:29.82]Don't worry, I've never seen Star Wars before.
[78:32.90]It's fine.
[78:34.12]You'll be fine.
[78:40.49]How are you still living?
[78:41.27]How are you still among the living?
[78:43.63]You got shot.
[79:21.94]I don't have a gun in my hand?
[79:25.40]Oh, you put the gun down when you do that.
[79:26.86]Alright, let's see who's up here.
[79:30.94]You.
[79:31.98]Dead.
[79:32.82]Dead.
[79:33.62]Dead.
[79:36.21]Anybody else?
[79:36.81]Ah, place to hide.
[79:42.69]Good vantage point.
[79:43.62]Guy with a gun.
[79:47.10]We got... fat guy.
[79:50.22]I need a... another gun.
[79:51.78]I need that.
[79:52.66]Give it to me.
[79:55.35]I use... I'll be right back.
[80:01.43]Oh shit!
[80:02.53]Okay, I'm fine.
[80:08.54]Why was I even locked on?
[80:09.86]Made no sense.
[80:15.16]Now I'm not locked on, and it was a problem.
[80:17.16]Alright, that's it.
[80:20.04]Just the two guys in there.
[80:22.24]Shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[80:23.98]It will be, though.
[80:24.70]Of course it will be.
[80:29.24]And... Got it.
[80:32.74]Okay.
[80:34.68]Alright, just slurp it up.
[80:38.58]Did you say I'm high as fuck?
[80:48.27]bother.
[80:49.91]What are you doing here?
[80:53.84]I'm not here.
[80:56.90]You know that.
[81:01.30]Yes, I know.
[81:05.66]Then why are you here?
[81:08.49]I don't know.
[81:10.23]I want to make you proud.
[81:12.11]Such things don't matter.
[81:13.73]I can see you haven't changed.
[81:15.81]You're just like me.
[81:16.73]You won't get an it until it's already too late.
[81:23.19]You know, it's me, the chicken.
[81:24.35]Your father is right.
[81:25.37]You don't get it, do you?
[81:27.45]Not that it matters anymore.
[81:28.67]It's all the same in the end.
[81:31.29]And this?
[81:32.21]Nothing wrong.
[81:32.93]There's nothing you can do about that, is there?
[81:37.54]God damn!
[81:40.30]But father, we already told you, Dutch.
[81:45.11]He's not here anymore.
[81:49.61]In fact, neither are you.
[81:58.13]That was a B for effort.
[82:03.26]A C- for effort.
[82:05.42]My face cams on.
[82:06.20]Let me turn it off.
[82:11.79]Thanks for reminding me.
[82:14.01]Uh, your style unlocked.
[82:16.09]Blood?
[82:16.41]What was it?
[82:25.18]What?
[82:27.01]Why is everybody laughing?
[82:29.07]Why is everybody laughing at me?
[82:41.12]Blood tired.
[82:41.90]I am still a little blood tired.
[82:43.88]I don't know about you guys, but when I get blood taken, it takes me like three or four days to completely recover from it.
[82:52.60]I just feel my life force draining, and it just, it throws me off for almost a week.
[82:57.60]It took six, seven vials.
[83:02.91]What do we have here?
[83:04.11]And I had to breathe into a bag.
[83:07.11]They were testing to see if I have, um... Helobacter pylori.
[83:12.34]Which is like a bad stomach and intestinal bacteria.
[83:17.46]It's a whole ordeal, but everything's fine.
[83:19.64]Don't worry.
[83:23.00]Uh, what do we have here, Johnson?
[83:27.41]That's not real, they were just fucking with you.
[83:29.07]What?!
[83:31.11]H. pylori is like a bacteria.
[83:32.65]I looked it up.
[83:34.50]What do we have here?
[83:35.76]Looks like your purp's been added again.
[83:37.16]This one got quite the treatment.
[83:47.09]How much for a vial of my blood?
[83:49.41]You're not getting any of my blood.
[83:50.59]This one got quite the treatment.
[83:52.93]He left another message.
[83:54.36]You have to stop them.
[83:55.20]I don't want to take any more innocent lives.
[83:56.78]Whoever did this must be completely out of their mind.
[84:02.22]He's a whack job, alright.
[84:03.42]This city seems to be full of them.
[84:05.48]Did he leave any clues behind?
[84:06.66]The chief's gonna be on my ass with all the press with this we'll get.
[84:13.36]A shell casing and a couple of prints.
[84:16.12]No, you know why I would never give somebody my blood?
[84:21.94]Because that's everything.
[84:24.16]Like, you're talking about everything.
[84:25.52]Oh, you're concerned that your passwords are in there?
[84:28.10]Your DNA is in there?
[84:29.78]Your entire genetic makeup is in that vial.
[84:33.82]Everything about you that ever will be and ever was.
[84:37.88]I don't want you guys to know what my fucking like body passwords are.
[84:41.32]Are you serious?
[84:47.42]A shell casing and a couple of prints is gonna be hard to see if they match the victim given the state he's in.
[84:54.63]Might find more when we do a more thorough inspection of the place.
[84:58.41]Well, I hope you do find something.
[84:59.85]Not to put any pressure on you guys, but my job's on the line on this one.
[85:03.69]We'll do our best.
[85:05.17]Alright, don't think I'll be much use here.
[85:07.43]I'm pretty beat.
[85:08.77]I'm heading home to catch some sleep.
[85:09.99]Let me know what you find tomorrow.
[85:12.81]Will do, sir.
[85:15.87]I don't know what my blood type is.
[85:17.48]I have no idea.
[85:25.31]Four?
[85:28.89]I don't know.
[85:30.53]I don't know.
[85:40.37]Brute Force is blood.
[85:44.49]No, sooner or later, I don't want anyone to have that.
[85:47.33]Because sooner or later, in 500 years, you'll be able to, like, read people's thoughts with their DNA and shit.
[85:55.78]You'll be able to, like, recreate somebody's brain and look up, like, in their brain catalog, everything they've ever done or said or anything they ever spoke of.
[86:06.85]You're going to be able to pour my blood into like a machine and go through my back catalog and find out the last time I shit my pants.
[86:12.63]I don't want you to be able to do that.
[86:14.37]Ever.
[86:14.93]In a thousand years.
[86:26.16]Time for bed.
[86:30.16]Why would you care if it's a thousand years?
[86:33.20]Because I care.
[86:34.22]I don't know.
[86:34.76]I don't want...
[86:38.24]Can't find it.
[86:44.51]Thunder and lightning.
[86:45.19]Okay, can't find it.
[86:49.19]What am I looking for?
[86:55.37]You'll be able to take that blood DNA brain thing, and you'll be able to just go watch a video recording of me, like a POV of me eating a booger when I was 11.
[87:07.84]That's scary.
[87:09.02]No.
[87:13.76]Uh, we got a huge amount of community subs here.
[87:15.94]Furt, thank you, Furt.
[87:16.96]Fernandez for the 10 community subs.
[87:24.36]Thank you so much, Furt.
[87:28.41]10 community subs.
[87:32.55]Coming in right now.
[87:35.33]Uh, am I missing something here?
[87:43.34]Uh... Looking for this.
[87:51.62]For Smash!
[87:53.83]Eno!
[87:54.15]Confirmed!
[87:54.93]Eno!
[87:55.45]Confirmed for Smash!
[87:57.23]What are you doing here?
[87:57.91]This is a crime scene.
[88:01.23]Well, you know what they say.
[88:04.87]Murderers always return to the scene of the crime.
[88:09.15]I guess there must be some truth to that, huh?
[88:13.34]Right?
[88:13.64]Who are you?
[88:15.04]You don't recognize me?
[88:16.02]We're related by blood, aren't we?
[88:20.10]Think of me as your son.
[88:21.36]You created me, after all.
[88:23.92]Give me back my gun, creep.
[88:26.14]You want it, huh?
[88:26.72]How about a hug instead?
[88:36.53]What?
[88:41.15]Did I drop a TV on his head?
[88:47.85]There you are, hop on in.
[88:49.43]Your next scene is up, so step on it.
[88:59.11]Is there a reason why we took the dog van from Dumb and Dumber?
[89:04.36]Okay, um, your next scene is up.
[89:15.68]What just happened?
[89:16.54]What did I just do?
[89:19.42]What?
[89:25.83]So this Hotline Miami is just a movie?
[89:28.43]Is that what this is?
[89:29.09]Ooh, I need that gun.
[89:35.08]Speaking of guns...
[89:45.61]I got stuck, I got stuck, I got stuck!
[89:50.39]Speaking of guns.
[89:50.95]Give me that one.
[89:56.63]Holy fuck!
[90:02.08]Got the gun over here.
[90:03.34]Anybody else in this room?
[90:04.30]Oh yeah, there is.
[90:15.91]What is this guy?
[90:17.78]What is that guy?
[90:20.46]I don't know yet.
[90:21.88]I'll have to... I'll deal with him in a minute.
[90:24.88]I... I... No!
[90:26.40]I had the glass!
[90:27.44]He was... I had... That's so clean, too.
[90:31.13]That really was clean.
[90:32.25]Fucking glass windows!
[90:44.20]Fucking every fucking level has to have a glass window Everywhere Pay attention
[91:03.33]No.
[91:04.19]Always a mistake.
[91:05.06]Never hit space on anybody.
[91:06.22]For any reason.
[91:07.36]What's the reason for it?
[91:08.18]It just takes extra time.
[91:09.40]You just get extra points.
[91:11.12]I'm just a C-minus fucking streamer.
[91:12.90]Why do I care about, like, the extra 200 points?
[91:15.16]2,000 points.
[91:15.42]Rewind?
[91:16.80]What are you talking about?
[91:21.22]Why would I rewind?
[91:22.34]Why would I do that?
[91:23.64]No, I'm not gonna rewind.
[91:25.06]I missed a cutscene?
[91:31.46]If I rewind, where's it gonna put me?
[91:33.86]I broke the game.
[91:35.00]Why did I break the... What?
[91:37.22]I better not regret this.
[91:38.16]I went all the way... How did I get it to work?
[91:56.99]I have no idea how... I was... What was I?
[91:59.85]Was I delirious?
[92:00.57]What were we talking about?
[92:01.41]DNA?
[92:04.85]Detective Pardo.
[92:06.45]You're a disgrace.
[92:07.25]I've never heard of anything like this before.
[92:09.10]Normally, I never offer any kindness to a person such as yourself.
[92:12.48]But since you are a police officer, I will now give you a choice.
[92:15.60]Turn yourself in and confess to your crimes.
[92:17.38]Maybe they'll go easy on you.
[92:19.48]If you don't, I have several officers waiting outside to arrest you.
[92:24.17]Sir, I'm not sure what you're talking about here.
[92:27.46]What is it you think I've done?
[92:28.20]I think I have a pile of evidence here against you.
[92:31.32]Ballistics report, fingerprints, witness statements.
[92:35.82]To think a police officer would be the Miami Mutilator.
[92:39.72]You make me sick.
[92:41.34]Now hand me your badge.
[92:42.38]I'll have one of our officers take your confession.
[92:45.66]Sir, there must have been some mistake.
[92:47.48]Someone must have set me up.
[92:49.67]I'll prove it to you if you just let me go, okay?
[92:52.40]You're going nowhere, Pardo.
[92:54.34]Don't make this any harder than it already is.
[92:57.14]Sorry, sir.
[92:57.78]You'll have to take me by force.
[92:59.40]Well, I did really miss a lot, didn't I?
[93:06.93]I just walked on the movie set and then started punching people.
[93:22.10]That doesn't work on dogs.
[93:29.88]Alright, alright.
[93:31.66]That's it.
[93:32.58]Keep it going.
[93:34.43]Pistol.
[93:35.91]Ooh.
[93:36.79]Ooh.
[93:37.79]Ooh.
[93:38.33]Why?
[93:44.67]I'm actually upset by that.
[93:46.63]I'm actually pissed off.
[93:48.37]What am I doing?
[94:02.66]I want this gun.
[94:04.66]That one.
[94:05.38]That one!
[94:06.18]I want this one!
[94:08.92]Okay.
[94:09.62]So we've got... Gun.
[94:14.40]No gun.
[94:16.14]Gun gun?
[94:17.60]Gun.
[94:18.06]Watch out for that gun.
[94:24.42]I didn't even get the guy.
[94:30.23]Oh, fucking...
[94:33.15]That's called panicking.
[94:47.78]Alright.
[94:49.56]Hydrate?
[94:49.92]I'm very hydrated.
[94:51.58]Yeah, I've got a... I've got a water here, I'm good.
[94:55.51]What about the guy in here?
[94:59.51]Nope.
[95:02.18]That guy would have just killed me if he had a gun.
[95:03.52]I was prepared for it.
[95:06.38]You know.
[95:08.67]I was very prepared.
[95:18.19]Ooh!
[95:19.27]Snipe!
[95:22.59]Alright.
[95:23.65]Grab the shotgun.
[95:25.39]Here it comes.
[95:28.63]This is where I get...
[95:32.87]I had it and it was so clean and I did it.
[95:34.79]I did that.
[95:41.60]I had that so I got all nice shot shot shot shot.
[95:48.84]We call this bullshit.
[95:52.57]This is called bullshit.
[95:56.38]By the way, nobody in the world, nobody on Earth, let's go over offices, okay?
[96:02.42]This makes sense.
[96:03.73]Nobody has a window to another coworker's office like this.
[96:08.33]This window doesn't do anything.
[96:09.91]Nobody has a window like this.
[96:13.85]This is called whining.
[96:16.85]Nobody has a window here.
[96:21.02]And who built these?
[96:24.47]The window should be here.
[96:25.45]To the outside.
[96:28.75]I've seen something like that before, actually.
[96:31.75]Wait, I won?
[96:32.37]I won.
[96:35.27]I'm not whining, am I?
[96:42.15]Is this whining?
[96:45.15]This guy with the taser.
[96:46.89]I'm about to start fucking whining, okay?
[96:52.86]Got him.
[97:06.23]Die!
[97:08.47]Had it.
[97:11.11]Ah, what the fuck am I doing?
[97:12.91]Just shoot him!
[97:16.75]I mean, why'd I have to be paranoid of 15 people with guns?
[97:22.58]Fine, I'll do the strategy.
[97:26.28]But it would've worked.
[97:30.80]Just shoot him.
[97:40.21]What the fuck was that?
[97:41.45]Dude.
[97:53.50]Yeah, I wanted to pick up the same weapon twice.
[97:55.14]That'd be wonderful.
[98:00.46]Got it.
[98:00.78]Okay.
[98:01.74]Jeez.
[98:02.14]I need more windows.
[98:08.85]Gun.
[98:12.77]Whoa!
[98:14.66]Ha!
[98:14.90]Ha!
[98:16.42]Fucking office windows!
[98:18.16]Why do they have... God damn it!
[98:20.32]What the fuck?
[98:22.58]What the hell?
[98:25.04]It's so unnecessary!
[98:36.19]He's terrible at 80% of every game he plays.
[98:40.17]Give me a break.
[98:41.75]Please.
[98:42.61]What?
[98:45.97]This shit is fucking hard as shit.
[98:52.38]People have quit this game.
[98:54.22]Like, not played for six months.
[98:56.40]You saw the chatroom.
[98:57.88]People went away from this game for six months.
[99:01.38]I'm still here.
[99:13.36]One guy said that.
[99:14.24]Yeah, and that's fine, because the game's fucking hard!
[99:16.73]I read a post on Twitter where a guy said he couldn't even beat the first room.
[99:27.39]Alright?
[99:29.13]But come on.
[99:30.43]I got a C on these levels.
[99:44.47]Did I get that guy too?
[99:50.63]Well, that worked.
[99:52.21]That worked.
[99:52.81]That worked.
[100:03.61]Now, I went to Twitter.
[100:05.53]There was a guy that was like, hey, I can't be the first room.
[100:08.33]Can somebody help?
[100:08.91]I mean, what do you think the responses were?
[100:17.59]I'm fucking this stupid door.
[100:34.78]Hey, you wanna know what all the responses were?
[100:40.44]You idiot.
[100:45.77]And then he finally beat the second floor.
[100:49.87]And he went on back on Twitter.
[100:52.29]And he said, hey guys, I beat the second floor.
[100:54.85]I'm really trying.
[100:55.67]It's a tough game.
[100:57.21]You idiot.
[101:07.07]And yes, I might be making this story up.
[101:08.83]So?
[101:09.27]You don't think this happened at one point?
[101:12.99]Somebody said this.
[101:26.05]Give me one pellet on this guy.
[101:27.51]Come on.
[101:27.97]Nobody else is up here, right?
[101:33.38]Get good.
[101:34.48]Most people get good?
[101:36.10]Oh, I've got some news for you.
[101:38.12]I've got news for you.
[101:39.94]Go open up the achievements of this game on Steam.
[101:43.56]How many people have gotten past the first level?
[101:46.43]It's not even going to be fucking 30%.
[101:47.35]I can't answer that.
[101:58.92]How many people beat the Cleric Beast?
[102:01.60]It's like 40.
[102:02.71]You're one of 40 people that did that.
[102:04.85]You should be proud of yourself.
[102:21.44]Put your hands behind your head and get down on the ground.
[102:28.90]29% of people have the beat the game achievement.
[102:32.87]So, yeah!
[102:34.79]What the heck?
[102:46.74]That's less than a third of all people that have played this game on Steam.
[102:57.97]Stop flaming me.
[102:58.81]Stop flaming me!
[103:04.94]Two out of thirds of bad?
[103:07.12]No, it's not.
[103:08.46]Come on, you can't look at it like that.
[103:11.94]If 70% of everybody, like, doesn't beat the game, does that mean that 70% of people aren't good gamers?
[103:21.25]I mean, probably.
[103:22.35]You're probably right.
[103:24.13]Don't shoot.
[103:24.59]I'm a detective.
[103:25.17]Here's my badge.
[103:28.58]I said get down on the ground.
[103:29.61]This is your last warning.
[103:31.81]Let me through.
[103:32.33]I'm a police... I don't get losing for that, right?
[103:46.50]You'd be surprised if you go look at achievements and trophies.
[103:48.80]This is Pardo speaking.
[103:53.13]Cough.
[103:58.99]They're casuals.
[104:05.56]Are they, though?
[104:07.18]What if they just... What if they just aren't good at it?
[104:10.58]It's okay.
[104:11.28]That's okay.
[104:12.44]If you're not good at it.
[104:13.32]We need to get out of the station.
[104:21.86]I don't feel too good.
[104:24.40]I'm gonna have to take the day off.
[104:25.88]This isn't really the time.
[104:42.42]You're not a pro gamer.
[104:54.22]T?
[104:56.12]C-.
[104:57.52]I've never failed a level.
[105:12.73]Uh, what?
[105:15.15]Hey you there, I'm here to see your boss.
[105:18.35]Bring him out for me, will you?
[105:20.69]You don't have an appointment, do you?
[105:22.95]Besides, the boss isn't in.
[105:25.72]Oh yeah?
[105:25.98]Well, his car is right outside.
[105:27.96]Boss has many cars.
[105:30.90]Was there anything else?
[105:33.34]Playing that game, huh?
[105:35.56]Back suit will not be telling that, okay?
[105:39.07]Time, guys, after today, we'll be in the big league again.
[105:42.19]Just remember the plan and don't be late if you are with Toast.
[105:47.23]Alright, I'm going in.
[105:47.95]Wish me luck.
[105:49.61]What?
[105:51.79]I don't get it.
[105:53.61]Um...
[106:06.19]Takeover is the last 24th scene.
[106:11.84]Killing punches, no weapons.
[106:14.26]Bloodline, firepower.
[106:18.88]Fi- what is firepower?
[106:23.38]Guess we'll find out.
[106:24.98]Uh, okay.
[106:26.35]Oh, this has to be T-pose, I remember.
[106:39.11]Oh, that didn't work.
[106:45.83]Maybe it will.
[106:49.45]Fuck, come on.
[106:53.16]Oh.
[107:04.16]Who's left?
[107:11.95]Watch it.
[107:14.57]But where are you gonna come from?
[107:15.99]Over here, I see you.
[107:20.00]Almost out of bullets.
[107:21.06]I gotta get this last guy right here.
[107:22.44]Through the glass.
[107:23.00]Okay.
[107:25.98]Who's left?
[107:26.82]That's a big gun right here, isn't it?
[107:29.96]No, it's not.
[107:30.30]Those are the guns I just had.
[107:31.28]I was just wearing those.
[107:33.30]Alright, that's fine.
[107:34.53]Let's go.
[107:41.02]This is all clear down here.
[107:42.36]Window, though.
[107:45.54]Watch out for the window.
[107:46.38]Watch out for the window.
[107:47.14]I panicked, but it's okay.
[107:51.46]I need that gun.
[107:54.60]Uh, this guy right here.
[107:55.50]I should get side on him right there.
[107:56.76]Nope.
[107:57.32]I tried again.
[107:57.84]I got it.
[107:58.54]Okay.
[107:59.00]What about you right here?
[108:01.39]Got it.
[108:05.75]What?
[108:05.97]What's going on?
[108:08.43]Uh...
[108:15.32]Is there a reason for that?
[108:22.70]I have one guy over there with a gun.
[108:24.18]Everybody else has melee.
[108:25.62]I don't think, unless I missed somebody over here.
[108:29.18]Yep, I did.
[108:29.68]What do I have to do with you?
[108:35.16]What do I do with you?
[108:36.74]What the fuck?
[108:37.82]No!
[108:38.32]What?
[108:39.42]I... I tried to punch him.
[108:42.22]He has so much reach.
[108:43.37]Holy shit!
[108:48.62]I mean, I knew it was the duck guy, but I... He has, like, some insane reach.
[108:53.94]You can't punch him.
[108:58.66]Okay.
[108:59.64]So, I need a melee weapon?
[109:01.84]Because I could punch the other... I could punch the other guy that was running, that was melee only.
[109:11.00]Apparently not this dude.
[109:16.79]Really?
[109:25.37]How's that guy doing?
[109:30.11]Oh fuck!
[109:30.49]I ran out of bullets right at the end.
[109:41.95]Only 64 bullets remaining in that.
[109:51.83]I say that like that's not very much.
[109:55.93]Same deal.
[109:56.27]Alright, where's the melee weapon?
[109:57.99]Right here, down in the ground.
[109:59.77]I don't want to get you.
[110:02.77]Let's wait.
[110:08.46]Alright.
[110:09.02]Then you.
[110:09.72]And you.
[110:15.02]Little dog.
[110:16.40]Yep.
[110:16.52]Yep.
[110:20.60]Give me a melee weapon?
[110:22.18]No, I could probably get you too.
[110:23.36]No, I can't.
[110:25.68]Whatever.
[110:31.40]I think I need a gun.
[110:34.25]I believe I st- yeah, I need to kill these dudes here.
[110:40.31]One more guy up there, I think.
[110:41.49]Maybe not.
[110:46.24]Can I pull him out?
[110:56.19]Can I like throw a knife over there?
[111:00.10]Over that?
[111:00.46]Or will it hit it?
[111:01.18]I'm not sure.
[111:04.90]Once I shoot this guy though, he's gonna run out.
[111:21.91]Is he out?
[111:23.19]No, he's not out.
[111:23.77]Okay.
[111:24.17]Now, melee weapon.
[111:25.07]Let's go.
[111:26.91]Pull him out.
[111:29.89]Let's go.
[111:32.01]Got it.
[111:32.31]Okay.
[111:36.10]One guy over there.
[111:38.16]I didn't check over this way, though.
[111:39.56]No, I got everybody over here, didn't I?
[111:41.86]That's where I started, isn't it?
[111:46.67]Okay, let's wrap around here again.
[111:48.31]No other dogs, no random stray people.
[111:52.15]Okay, I just want to check.
[111:56.35]I think there might be another guy over here.
[112:00.67]I didn't mean to click my fucking thumb.
[112:16.25]Holy shit.
[112:16.92]Okay.
[112:24.44]Alright, we got one guy left, I think, right here.
[112:27.39]That's it.
[112:29.53]Nobody's standing.
[112:30.29]Nobody in a bush, right?
[112:31.15]I'm not gonna get bushed.
[112:59.16]Give me a gun.
[113:03.41]Wow!
[113:04.17]What?
[113:04.59]Oh, he came from the top.
[113:06.85]Oops.
[113:21.34]Knew he was coming.
[113:23.42]Shit.
[113:39.88]He's coming.
[113:40.40]Oh, he's coming.
[113:40.90]He's coming.
[113:41.18]He's coming to get me.
[113:41.92]He's coming to get me.
[113:43.92]The guy with the melee is on his way.
[113:45.28]Oh, fuck.
[113:49.48]Okay.
[113:50.20]Relax.
[113:50.92]What else is there?
[113:51.58]I need a gun.
[113:53.94]That'll do it.
[114:07.87]Windows...
[114:10.17]Anybody above?
[114:10.67]I think this room is safe.
[114:12.46]Yeah, this room is safe, except for the windows.
[114:19.67]Wait, what?
[114:19.97]Did I not go through?
[114:47.18]No, just use them with 10.
[114:49.82]Knew somebody else was gonna come over there.
[114:51.16]I, like, KNEW it.
[114:53.28]And I fucking FREAKED out.
[114:57.97]Good.
[114:58.59]Alright.
[114:59.89]Now... Now what?
[115:03.81]There's a window there, they can shoot through here... Ay-yay-yay, you go through f- one, two, three, four rooms with this window!
[115:18.27]There's no other way I can get over there.
[115:20.27]Any windows up top?
[115:21.09]There are windows right there.
[115:22.25]Alright.
[115:25.89]I'm gonna go up.
[115:33.18]Itchy arm, hold on.
[115:33.86]Alright.
[115:34.56]Fuck.

[116:23.70]Somebody's coming.
[116:24.48]Which way are they coming, though?
[116:25.50]Are they coming this way?
[116:44.91]Who else?
[116:45.41]Anybody else down the whole hallway?
[116:47.05]I don't know.
[116:50.15]I gotta go this way anyways, but...
[116:53.11]Yeah, he saw me.
[116:53.65]He's coming.

[117:18.56]I'm so paranoid.
[117:19.36]Someone's gonna fucking come all the way down here.
[117:25.16]Alright, safe.
[117:25.76]What is this?
[117:28.92]I can't pick it up.

[117:50.30]I gotta pick off at least a couple people.
[117:58.99]There's gonna be a dog coming.

[118:02.84]Okay.
[118:03.08]You sure?
[118:03.54]He's coming, though.

[118:22.57]I'm just gonna...
[118:30.03]Excuse me?
[118:45.24]Did I fall off the map?
[118:46.74]Did I walk backwards too far?
[118:48.44]Is that what happened?
[118:52.76]Fuck it.
[118:58.60]No, you can't do it like that unless you memorize the entire level.
[119:01.75]I have to memorize the whole level to play it like that.
[119:06.03]Oh, here comes the dog.
[119:06.71]Wait till he goes across the entire map.
[119:08.47]The whole thing.
[119:09.11]I can't believe it.
[119:26.22]Probably another dog coming.
[119:33.42]Alright, I got a bunch of- Who the fuck are you?
[119:36.32]What are you doing on the stairs?
[119:37.94]Why are you in the very beginning on the stairs?

[120:39.83]Is somebody here?
[120:41.23]Somebody's here.
[120:45.03]Okay, I gotta sit here for a second because I just may have alerted, like, at least two.
[120:56.03]Oh my lord.
[120:56.75]Okay.
[120:57.73]Did I get him?
[121:06.50]Nope, just wait.
[121:12.76]We'll make it over here eventually.
[121:13.88]He'll find it.
[121:20.14]Thanks for the new gun.
[121:22.00]Now, it's a question of shooting through here.
[121:28.60]Where the fuck?
[121:29.50]Holy shit, there's an entrance there!
[121:32.06]Move out of the way.
[121:34.53]Alright, anybody?
[121:35.15]Somebody?
[121:35.63]I gotta hide over here.
[121:36.99]Just hide here.
[121:38.07]No, where?
[121:38.47]I know how to get a safe room.
[121:39.77]This one's safe.
[121:40.67]Right?
[121:41.01]No, it's not.
[121:41.29]Yes, it is.
[121:45.55]There's only two other people in that other room.
[121:48.91]I think I'm good.
[121:52.84]I'm gonna go down.
[121:55.76]If I see a dog, I swear to you.
[122:04.97]I'm so ready for a dog.
[122:09.33]Where is the dog?
[122:13.83]Look at how far away you are.
[122:17.07]I'm so fucking paranoid right now.
[122:20.55]Any other guns up here?
[122:21.77]This one.
[122:26.89]Go for it.
[122:27.43]Whatever.
[122:27.75]Guy in the stairs.
[122:30.05]Right?
[122:31.67]Nope.
[122:37.51]I'm gonna get you.
[122:38.37]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[122:38.97]I need a machete.
[122:40.29]Okay, there's a machete right here.
[122:43.39]Give me the machete.
[122:44.21]Oh, you idiot.
[122:48.69]You fucking idiot.
[122:49.53]Is it safe to get that?
[122:55.81]One guy right here.
[122:57.98]Holy fuck, he almost just got me.
[123:06.49]Last guy?
[123:08.31]Right?
[123:09.21]Nope.
[123:12.99]That guy would have killed me.
[123:15.85]Alright.
[123:17.23]So, looks like I gotta go down... This last dude right here.
[123:22.10]No windows for him to shoot me.
[123:25.46]Nobody else, just him.
[123:35.03]I know I freaked out right there, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
[123:39.59]Alright, another one.
[123:40.73]Get stuck.
[123:41.71]No, this way.
[123:42.55]Fuck.
[124:10.49]Dammit.
[124:10.93]Alright.
[124:23.76]Wrap around.
[124:24.38]Let's do it again here.
[124:29.20]Give me the shotgun.
[124:30.08]So I gotta take this guy out.
[124:33.71]Cleanly.
[124:36.23]He's all the way at the end, and then shotgun blast once.
[124:44.18]I... whatever.
[124:48.86]Three shots.
[124:49.70]Who's up there?
[124:50.52]Okay, it's safe.
[124:52.91]No, it's not.
[124:53.35]I can't go over there.
[124:58.47]Dog?
[125:01.37]Dog?
[125:01.91]Big guy.
[125:04.61]This room is safe.
[125:08.05]I need a better gun than this.
[125:13.42]Windows.
[125:14.02]No, I don't- I gotta be- Shit.
[125:38.62]Dog.
[125:39.24]No.
[125:55.34]I'm just going to make sure no one's right.
[125:57.91]Okay, there's another dog.
[126:02.65]Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[126:04.71]That's not going to make anybody sprint over here?
[126:06.04]Are we sure about that?
[126:08.32]Give me the other gun.
[126:15.82]These dogs are freaking out.
[126:16.82]Are they trying to come get me?
[126:18.80]I think they're trying to get me, but I don't know.
[126:21.52]I gotta go.
[126:21.98]I gotta take those.
[126:22.54]Okay.
[126:22.72]There's a melee only guy right here.
[126:25.08]I gotta get this guy now.
[126:26.30]Okay.
[126:26.94]So give me a melee weapon.
[126:30.68]I'm gonna go pull that guy out.
[126:37.43]Come on.
[126:38.45]Come on down here.
[126:41.39]Alright.
[126:42.07]I think that's it for that.
[126:43.63]I need a gun back.
[126:49.22]They're coming for me?
[126:49.88]Are they?
[126:54.18]I have to kill them right now.
[126:55.70]I gotta go up, down here, and I gotta shoot.
[126:58.62]Alright, that's my plan.
[126:59.80]Watch out for that guy.
[127:06.04]Those dogs are coming after me.
[127:07.36]I don't know.
[127:20.07]I hate not being able to see over there.
[127:23.59]Dogs are coming over here now.
[127:24.72]No, they're not.
[127:27.92]It's not safe standing there.
[127:35.62]One dude, and then it's safe.
[127:37.34]And I can collect guns.
[127:39.55]That guy.
[127:40.53]Is that a melee-only guy?
[127:41.95]No?
[127:43.11]Just a guy?
[127:54.21]I'm just like losing it.
[127:55.25]I'm freaking out right now because I'm terrified of something behind me.
[127:59.47]Okay, gun.
[128:01.27]New gun.
[128:01.69]I can go down.
[128:04.41]There's only one tube remaining.
[128:06.95]I have to go from this room.
[128:11.00]No windows.
[128:11.74]I just have to shoot.
[128:14.12]There's a door.
[128:20.78]Don't fuck it up.
[128:24.55]I fucked it up.
[128:25.17]I fucked it up bad.
[128:29.29]I fucked it up real bad.
[128:30.17]Okay.
[128:33.60]Wait, that's not it?
[128:34.16]Um, what?
[128:36.36]Where?
[128:37.86]Okay, that is it.
[128:38.64]Is it?
[128:41.50]I see the arrow.
[128:45.84]Okay, it is.
[128:51.63]This game's gonna give me diarrhea.
[128:52.77]It really is.
[128:55.61]Fuck, there's even more.
[128:57.62]No, is this it?
[128:59.12]Alright, this is the end.
[128:59.98]I just gotta get rid of everybody in this room?
[129:02.34]Is there any special gun I can pick up in here?
[129:06.76]I don't think there's anything else.
[129:18.20]Dropping the gun on the ground.
[129:19.56]You got some balls coming in here alone, but this is as far as you go.
[129:24.12]That's how you greet your guests, is it?
[129:27.50]You can drop the act now, face it.
[129:29.04]You're already dead.
[129:29.73]Then why are you still talking to me?
[129:33.81]Got him.
[129:34.43]I'll give you ten seconds to surrender.
[129:36.59]Maybe I'll let you live.
[129:38.37]You're out of your mind.
[129:39.23]Uh-oh.
[129:43.65]One, two, three...
[129:49.64]7, 8, 9, 10.
[129:54.45]How does it feel?
[129:56.39]How do you like it?
[129:58.59]I've been playing like that the whole game.
[130:00.41]Do you have a problem with that one?
[130:12.92]Alright, fine.
[130:14.95]That's okay.
[130:23.29]Sick.
[130:24.47]Why don't you swing on by and check it out?
[130:26.45]Oh.
[130:27.47]Hello?
[130:28.63]Anyone there?
[130:29.59]Click.
[130:35.68]Wait, are those jelly beans?
[130:39.62]No, those are drugs.
[130:40.36]Okay.
[130:40.58]Hey, boss, take it easy on those pills.
[130:41.98]You shouldn't take too many of them.
[130:47.76]Can I stand up?
[130:59.94]What the fuck is this?
[131:08.98]Oh no.
[131:11.88]You really gonna throw Yoshi's Island fucking mushroom level at me right now?
[131:17.90]This is gonna make me sick.
[131:22.75]Oh no.
[131:23.53]I hate this.
[131:34.36]Who the fuck are you?
[131:38.93]Why can I not hit this guy?
[131:49.37]Dog has, like, two heads?
[131:55.47]Please tell me I can, like, first try this.
[131:56.91]This is actually gonna give me a problem.
[132:04.64]Alright, come on, let's go.
[132:06.62]Congratulations, you beat the level.
[132:13.72]Uh... Is that a bear?
[132:20.66]There's an actual bear in here.
[132:26.48]What the fuck?
[132:28.73]What?
[132:29.43]Okay, I got...
[132:42.70]No, I get it.
[132:44.12]I get it.
[132:44.44]Well, actually, I don't get it.
[132:46.17]I'll get it if something else happens.
[132:48.09]Alright, I win.
[132:59.98]So, this is... Alright.
[133:01.62]This is... I get it.
[133:03.78]I get it.
[133:04.66]I understand it.
[133:16.09]Gotta get a grip!
[133:20.43]Gar.
[133:20.87]Uh-oh.
[133:26.59]Windows!
[133:27.39]Of course!
[133:28.23]Yeah, I- that's- that is what I'm afraid of.
[133:35.16]Yeah, alright, he's on a- this is- this happened in like the third level, didn't it?
[133:44.22]I get it.
[133:45.44]No, I get it.
[133:46.52]That was like the zebra.
[133:50.76]What is that?
[133:53.76]I guess I'm gonna... Does the explosion hurt me?
[134:04.76]I apologize to those of you that are, you know, photosensitive to this kind of shit.
[134:13.01]I don't even know if I'm shooting.
[134:25.44]It is... was it a tiger?
[134:30.80]Did I win?
[134:34.32]I did.
[134:41.20]That's it.
[134:41.98]Keep going.
[134:47.33]Like an axe?
[134:49.71]Um... I don't remember bats.
[134:58.82]Oh, no, it's the two ducks.
[135:00.06]Okay, it's the... It's my favorite character!
[135:02.08]Ooh.
[135:04.62]That's my favorite character.
[135:06.68]Or two characters.
[135:14.72]Uh...
[135:27.40]Alright.
[135:29.46]Oh f- Just doing a gigantic fire-breathing dragon.
[135:39.94]Oh my goodness.
[135:41.02]Um... I killed one of them before.
[135:45.58]Dodge it?
[135:46.04]I mean, easier said than done.
[135:55.92]Are they immune to damage?
[135:56.88]Oh, okay.
[136:08.25]I see.
[136:08.55]Holy fuck.
[136:10.47]Alright, so... I can only hurt them at a specific time.
[136:26.68]Oh, man.
[136:30.20]When can I hit you?
[136:34.78]Do it!
[136:40.39]Sorry, Swans.
[136:46.01]Whoops.
[136:46.47]Do I need that?
[136:47.41]I hope not.
[136:56.83]Is this the end of the game?
[136:57.69]That's it?
[137:02.75]Okay, that's the end of the game.
[137:07.52]No, the last game had a post-credits chapter, right?
[137:12.10]That's probably what's gonna happen.
[137:20.46]Well, yeah, the ending was not actually the ending.
[137:23.65]Out of chronological order.
[137:28.19]Uh, so I have no idea what the fuck that game was.
[137:31.41]I have no idea what happened.
[137:34.15]I have a general understanding of kind of what happened, but I don't think I do.
[137:39.71]There's a video on YouTube that greatly explains it all.
[137:58.68]Because that was the son of the first game boss.
[138:06.76]And they were all in a military troop together, right?
[138:15.05]First game is Jacket, and... No, that son wasn't part of the group.
[138:29.02]But I'm talking about the whole thing.
[138:30.44]There was so many characters.
[138:31.24]That guy was a serial killer?
[138:32.35]Alright, so Evan, what's your opinion?
[138:35.91]Do you think there's any truth to his claims of a conspiracy?
[138:40.07]I couldn't find any substantial proof of a conspiracy, but my research strongly indicates that there might have been one.
[138:45.80]Hopefully my book will get people to start asking questions.
[138:50.49]Perhaps a more thorough investigation can be conducted in the future.
[138:53.67]You're implying that the official investigation wasn't thorough?
[138:56.83]From the police reports I've seen, the investigation was a complete mess.
[139:00.20]A lot of stones were left unturned, so many questions left unanswered.
[139:03.94]I really hope we'll get to the bottom of the whole incident one day.
[139:07.52]And when can we expect to read this book of... yzzzzzzzt?
[139:12.24]We are interrupting the program for an emergency broadcast.
[139:14.30]The President of the United States has been assassinated.
[139:17.36]A press conference in Washington was interrupted by a league of armed men during what appears to be a coup d'etat.
[139:23.63]The president was shot and killed.
[139:25.09]The Russian president was also shot dead in the chaos that ensued.
[139:27.79]What?
[139:28.55]The ringleader of the uprising appears to be a U.S.
[139:30.79]Army general.
[139:31.49]In this time, no official statements have been made.
[139:35.47]Experts believe this will be seen as an act of war against Russia.
[139:38.49]The fear of the repercussions may be severe.
[139:40.47]Stay tuned as we will be reporting live from...
[139:46.53]Looks like you've gotten yourself quite comfortable over here.
[139:50.05]You know what they say about good times, don't you?
[139:52.94]Yeah.
[139:53.78]Good times never last.
[139:55.32]That's right.
[139:56.22]Soon this will all be over.
[139:57.86]I had a feeling things would catch up with me.
[140:00.46]Are they on to me?
[140:02.62]Oh, no.
[140:03.12]This is much worse.
[140:05.86]How long do I have?
[140:08.20]You?
[140:09.02]You don't have much time.
[140:10.12]No one does.
[140:11.26]There's nothing I can do about it, right?
[140:13.08]No.
[140:14.02]By now there's nothing anyone can do about it.
[140:17.23]Okay.
[140:18.45]No need to fight it, then.
[140:20.31]I'm glad you understand.
[140:22.91]Leaving this world is not as scary as it sounds.
[140:32.52]Was I on drugs?
[140:39.71]So, I was on drugs.
[140:48.28]oh nuke didn't that happen in the first one too didn't that happen in the first game huh okay no didn't you like walk out of the door in the first game at the store and it did this
[141:18.55]A nuke was dropped.
[141:22.02]Oh, that was in this game, okay.
[141:46.46]It's the war between USA and Russia.
[141:48.71]This is the prequel.
[142:17.84]We're getting Pulp Fiction.
[142:19.17]This is the opening to Smash Ultimate.
[142:37.80]Not really, but I mean...
[142:48.91]Sony Computer Entertainment?
[142:53.12]They had... Really?
[142:54.90]I thought it was just... I'll go insane if I play hard mode?
[143:02.92]No, I can't do hard mode.
[143:05.26]Some of you guys are superhuman.
[143:09.16]I'm not.
[143:09.78]I'm just a mere... I'm just a mere mortal.
[143:13.24]I can't do hard mode.
[143:22.87]Try one level on hard.
[143:23.91]There's a new opening to hard mode.
[143:25.41]We'll take a look at it.
[143:27.89]And then I do have a sampling of some community workshop stuff.
[143:33.15]Because that's pretty interesting and I'd like to check it out.
[143:38.22]Well, I did it.
[143:38.84]I beat Hotline Miami 2.
[143:40.76]Remember when I started and a bunch of people in chat said he's not going to finish this game?
[143:44.96]There's no way.
[143:46.02]Never.
[143:46.34]He's never going to finish this game.
[143:49.34]I remember that.
[143:52.81]Two days later.
[143:56.47]Done.
[144:04.08]I said that and I stand by it.
[144:07.74]How do you stand by that if you just watched the credits roll?
[144:14.04]You're not gonna beat it.
[144:14.88]I stand by that statement.
[144:19.95]What's that?
[144:20.23]What happened?
[144:21.87]Oh.
[144:24.03]Alright, so, new game?
[144:29.33]Hard?
[144:29.67]Is it... Is it gonna continue, or...?
[144:38.38]Does it matter?
[144:39.18]Do I have to press continue?
[144:40.38]Or can I just do hard mode?
[144:42.30]I just wanna see the cutscene.
[144:47.24]I like this song.
[144:48.60]This song's really good.
[144:49.74]The whole soundtrack is great, but I like the title card.
[144:55.10]Let's see.
[145:01.65]You all came back, huh?
[145:03.43]Why?
[145:04.19]You all know how this ends, don't you?
[145:08.17]What the hell are you blabbing about?
[145:10.81]Who are you people?
[145:11.38]Why am I here?
[145:13.40]You're not really here, are you?
[145:16.64]Hmm.
[145:17.79]Is this another dream?
[145:19.63]It's all a dream, isn't it?
[145:21.67]Enjoy it while you can.
[145:23.21]Soon you will all have to wake up.
[145:25.33]I think I've heard enough.
[145:29.11]Hey guys, let's get out of here.
[145:30.09]There's only one way out of this, unfortunately.
[145:34.11]Why have you taken us here?
[145:35.23]Everybody's dying.
[145:36.91]To tell you that it's all pointless.
[145:39.06]You're all heading the wrong way.
[145:40.28]At best, you'll end up in the cemetery.
[145:43.18]So what?
[145:43.50]I'm not scared of dying.
[145:46.16]You don't care what happens to your friends either, do you?
[145:49.46]I feel like my acting level here is like TikTok level.
[145:56.95]I imagine the split screen here.
[146:01.57]You don't care what happens to your friends either, do you?
[146:09.92]Keep on following in your father's footsteps.
[146:11.92]I've told you where they lead.
[146:19.61]Look, I'm sorry for... I appreciate it, but I'm not really who you think I am.
[146:24.19]Remorse is not going to get you anywhere, I'm afraid.
[146:28.41]You think you know everything, huh?
[146:35.16]You... I didn't... I don't get... Why is it you do the things you do?
[146:39.58]You're just gonna sit there and judge us, are you?
[146:43.38]Is that what you think?
[146:45.00]You don't know who I am, do you?
[146:47.80]Fine, have it your way.
[146:50.03]Just who are you then?
[146:51.69]I'm the opposite of why you are writing your book.
[146:55.47]I'm something you will never understand.
[146:59.47]Looks like it's just you and me left now.
[147:03.06]We've met before, haven't we?
[147:04.84]Yes, yes we have.
[147:06.70]I'm glad you remember.
[147:08.86]I know you didn't ask for any of this.
[147:11.30]I wish we could have met again under different circumstances.
[147:13.94]This is the guy from, uh...
[147:16.71]The guy that... The warden.
[147:19.81]You know... Look at the guy!
[147:26.70]This guy!
[147:27.36]What's his name?
[147:27.84]What's his fucking name?
[147:34.54]Andy... No.
[147:35.56]Not Andy Griffith though.
[147:36.78]The guy that was in Andy Griffith.
[147:38.27]That was like the bumbling warden.
[147:41.70]Don Knotts.
[147:42.33]There it is.
[147:42.71]Okay.
[147:43.85]I wish we could have met again under different circumstances.
[147:46.75]Me too.
[147:54.56]Alright.
[147:58.62]Galaxy Film Presents in association with Don Knotts.
[148:06.19]That was an actual boomer joke.
[148:08.61]Yeah, whatever.
[148:09.17]Some of you guys are old enough to know what that is.
[148:10.65]A lot of you are.
[148:11.67]Midnight Animal.
[148:21.19]Press space to execute a knocked out enemy.
[148:24.25]That didn't do the tutorial.
[148:25.21]Hard tutorial.
[148:31.22]Look at this.
[148:31.92]Beating it.
[148:34.68]She's upstairs.
[148:35.20]Go get her.
[148:37.83]Finish the game on hard.
[148:45.29]Stop.
[148:45.77]What?
[148:46.77]Stop.
[148:47.23]Stop.
[148:47.65]No.
[148:48.01]Stop.
[148:48.37]What?
[148:48.75]What?
[148:53.20]Stop.
[149:00.80]Oh, okay.
[149:02.26]Hold on.
[149:07.21]Here comes the Garfield.
[149:09.17]Garfield what?
[149:09.91]Oh.
[149:13.33]Well, that was fun.
[149:23.40]Don't I have that on?
[149:28.00]Oops.
[149:34.99]Some people were warning me about that before.
[149:39.59]What?

[150:32.96]And I'm allowed to do anything else.
[150:50.87]Come on.
[150:51.31]First, I can do like the second level on hard.
[151:20.63]Fuck, this is hard.
[151:22.51]This is harder than it was before, I think.
[151:23.77]There's more enemies.
[151:26.33]Nice, okay.
[151:45.95]That was much harder than the other one.
[151:51.60]I feel like there was like an extra five to ten enemies.
[151:56.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[152:02.77]So what do I get on hard?
[152:08.93]He can't do it on hard!
[152:10.03]He can't do it on- Gosh, he can't do it on hard!
[152:11.89]He's not gonna be able to do it on hard!
[152:18.33]Not even hard.
[152:20.29]God.

[154:48.47]I got stuck on the...
[155:16.58]I had it too, that's too bad Fuck, I keep getting stuck on this
[155:49.43]Yeah, the no gun thing really is kind of giving me a huge hard time right now.
[156:03.48]I'll try it.
[156:06.06]Really, it didn't... I feel like with a gun, I would probably have done this already.
[156:30.72]Oh, come on, get over here.
[156:32.52]Get over here, you're clearly looking at me.
[156:36.81]What the fuck?!
[156:38.21]Oh, my lord.
[156:38.87]It really is just play peekaboo with this guy.
[156:56.56]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[157:06.02]I don't have to prove anything.
[157:07.88]I still want to try to do it.
[157:10.06]I'm having fun.
[157:13.98]Rewind and pick a different class.
[157:15.42]There's too many people far away.
[157:21.75]Too many people with guns.
[157:35.95]I don't understand how sometimes you just don't see me and other times you just pinpoint accuracy kill me instantly Here we go So we got one two three see if you can pull this guy again I'm gonna go up top and punch that guy in the face
[158:05.84]I think, I think I'm gonna do that.
[158:07.64]Mmm, don't get cocky.
[158:10.86]Just get it normally.
[158:12.88]Alright, got it.
[158:44.40]Alright, what's that mean?
[158:45.70]That's an A+.
[158:46.56]I'll take an A+.
[158:47.56]Look at how much I've improved going back to these other levels.
[158:50.26]Alright, now let's do hard mode.
[159:00.37]Oh, I can't.
[159:05.01]Not S+.
[159:09.78]Do it again without cheating?
[159:11.24]What?

[159:14.54]Didn't you guys see what Sakurai said?
[159:18.04]You can play Smash Bros.
[159:19.26]any way you want.
[159:19.92]There's no correct way to play.
[159:21.08]Alright, I'm gonna go, uh... I'm just gonna take a break.
[159:31.24]Grab another water.
[159:32.98]And I'll come back and I'm gonna play some of the community workshop levels.
[159:36.40]I have a bunch of them already downloaded.

[163:04.57]NVIDIA GTX 1080.
[163:09.43]1080.
[163:09.45]32 gigs of RAM.
[163:10.17]Somebody asked what my specs were.
[163:20.86]Stop flexing.
[163:21.68]No, somebody just asked and I figured I would come back and say it.
[163:24.60]Alright, so let's do the community workshop stuff.
[163:31.58]Some of this looks pretty interesting.
[163:33.10]Alright, let's get that off.

[163:53.66]We've got... Here's what we've got.
[164:01.99]There's already one here that I see.
[164:09.86]As you can... Yeah, that's here.
[164:14.35]This is just a small sampling.
[164:15.73]There was a lot of community levels.
[164:19.15]Figured I would just get some of these.
[164:23.89]There is a secret level too.
[164:25.19]We'll try it.
[164:29.04]Who could that be in Compact?
[164:31.04]I think it's one of the characters in the game.
[164:33.73]So we're going to go... We'll just start here.
[164:35.97]This is called Auto Angel.
[164:39.13]By Atlin.

[165:45.52]Oh, I only... It's... Alright, it's a military mission.

[165:54.16]I gotta conserve my ammo.
[166:02.23]Oh!
[166:03.22]Alright, that's good.
[166:07.70]Uh, guy with the gun in the right room.
[166:22.86]Top here.
[166:24.69]Ooh, I didn't see him in there.
[166:25.75]I did not see him.
[166:29.11]Alright, so somebody said he didn't get the Garfield one.
[166:35.29]No, I didn't pick the Garfield one.
[166:38.22]I did not choose the Garfield one.
[166:47.24]Oh god, what am I doing?
[166:55.66]Garfield.
[166:56.62]I'm not doing Garfield.
[166:58.10]I had to skip the Garfield one.
[167:00.18]I got the Ninja Turtles one instead.
[167:09.31]Garfield.
[167:09.81]We want Garfield.
[167:12.25]Well, you can't always get what you want for Christmas, okay?
[167:19.11]Shit.
[167:19.43]I didn't see that guy.
[167:41.19]Fuck, I was trying to change.
[167:46.72]I'm just not being patient with this one.
[167:52.04]Ruining Christmas.
[167:52.86]How far up is that guy?
[167:56.60]There's a guy with a shotgun over here.
[167:57.86]I'm gonna try going left.
[168:11.90]That guy's a gun.
[168:23.67]Is my game crashing?
[168:27.73]No, okay.
[168:31.48]Alright, safe, safe, safe.
[168:33.08]That guy's a gun over there.
[168:41.28]The door opens, the door opens, the door opens!
[168:43.10]Whoa!
[168:45.48]This guy's gonna shoot me.
[168:47.92]Come on, get over here.
[169:03.24]Oh, fine.
[169:19.38]I'm gonna have the gun, and then I take care of that guy over there.
[169:22.83]That's it, right?
[169:23.63]Yep.
[169:29.03]What?!
[169:29.89]What the fuck?!
[169:31.17]No!
[169:31.91]Oh my god!
[169:33.43]No!
[169:35.59]Where the hell did he come from?!
[169:36.87]He was all the way down there!
[169:46.72]One fucking guy just sprinting.
[170:17.54]Get that guy Nobody with a gun over there.
[170:26.03]I have the gun right here.
[170:28.03]One, two, three
[170:36.92]Now watch out for the guy that sprints over here.
[170:38.37]Make sure I can see him.
[170:39.81]I don't see him yet.
[170:41.85]I'm just going to get in there and stab him.
[170:45.81]Okay.
[170:46.87]Didn't see that guy.
[170:47.77]That would have been horrible.
[170:50.15]Alright.
[170:51.33]Keep going.
[171:10.86]Dog dog woo and we're down.
[171:12.43]No, no, I could go down Yummy Wow, that's close
[171:39.58]Safe, safe, safe.

[171:45.94]Guy with two guns.
[171:49.97]Well, apparently I had to... Okay.
[171:52.53]I only have one bullet left.
[171:56.39]And this guy with a gun?
[171:58.61]I'm going to just go like this.
[172:01.92]Save that bullet for... Okay, three people here.
[172:05.72]Is there ammo on this level?
[172:07.94]Is that ammo, technically?
[172:11.34]I'm good.
[172:11.76]Let me just wrap around here.
[172:13.98]I don't wanna get sniped.
[172:21.80]Okay, just checking, making sure no one's there.
[172:25.19]Big guy.
[172:25.55]Does he come out?
[172:28.41]Okay.
[172:31.73]Oh, no!
[172:32.55]I forgot he wasn't dead!
[172:33.85]Ugh!

[172:39.16]Shit!
[172:42.98]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[172:45.62]Dammit.
[172:47.60]Just little tiny little miniscule, itty bitty mistakes.
[172:52.93]They're so small you can't even see them.
[172:54.35]You need a microscope to see them.
[173:10.95]Okay.
[173:18.55]Alright.
[173:23.73]That takes care of that.
[173:25.03]Let's go up.
[173:26.79]I got stuck in a door.
[173:29.55]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[173:32.59]I only, I got three bullets here.
[173:34.41]Nobody, is there somebody in this room?
[173:37.99]No.
[173:39.19]Alright, just these two.
[173:40.43]Now don't fuck it up.
[173:45.41]Got it.
[173:45.77]Okay.
[173:46.43]That's it?
[173:47.07]Nope.
[173:47.41]One guy left.
[173:48.67]Watch out for the windows.
[173:49.45]He can see through windows.
[173:50.45]I need ammo.
[174:02.56]This is gonna be bad.
[174:03.62]I need to go get ammo.
[174:06.28]Is that an ammo box?
[174:07.60]I don't know.
[174:08.44]We're about to find out.
[174:16.74]It is.
[174:22.62]Wow!
[174:23.70]Wow!
[174:24.50]Wow!
[174:25.38]Phew!
[174:26.40]Okay.
[174:28.99]Wow!
[174:31.37]Wow!
[174:32.05]Uh, what do I have?
[174:34.67]Staircase again?
[174:36.60]I feel like I should get ammo.
[174:38.94]Interesting.
[174:41.18]Okay.
[174:41.56]Right here.
[175:04.31]what what the hell
[175:15.10]The fucking computer.
[175:18.28]Deadhead.
[175:18.86]We got a guy right here who needs to be stabbed.
[175:28.29]And get shot across the way from you.
[175:29.85]Not gonna happen.
[175:31.09]Sorry.
[175:42.43]I just watched myself die and there's nothing I can do there.
[175:52.50]Oh my god.
[175:53.36]Does the door block melee weapons too?
[175:55.10]Like, does that seriously happen?
[175:58.92]What in the name of god is that?
[176:10.49]Watch out for that.
[176:12.53]Why are there windows there?
[176:23.82]Okay, one bolt left.
[176:25.78]I think there's another big guy.
[176:31.42]Where is he?
[176:31.92]Maybe not.
[176:35.46]Yeah, he's right there.
[176:36.08]Alright.
[176:38.32]I need to kill this dude right now!
[176:42.02]Then, I guess I can hide in here?
[176:44.84]This is a weird spot to be.
[176:46.10]No, I gotta get rid of this guy too.
[176:51.63]Shit.
[176:54.06]Come on, look at me.
[176:55.36]I'm gonna have to rush him.
[176:57.52]RUSH HIM!
[177:01.33]Get these two, and then call it a day.
[177:03.31]Knock out the guy with the gun.
[177:13.77]Alright.
[177:14.37]I got two- I have one bullet.
[177:16.51]It has to be on that guy.
[177:17.71]We're going through here.
[177:20.15]Actually, I don't know.
[177:21.05]Up here.
[177:21.83]This is probably safer.
[177:26.02]I think I can pick this guy off first.
[177:27.42]There we go.
[177:30.88]That's it.
[177:31.66]No, it's not it.
[177:33.36]Who's left?
[177:33.90]Huh.
[177:39.31]One guy somewhere?
[177:39.95]Just sitting around?
[177:43.13]Okay.
[177:43.49]Well, whatever.
[177:44.01]Okay.
[177:57.82]Oh, it's this dude in here.
[177:59.08]The guy that's been crouching.
[178:00.16]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[178:02.12]You gotta hit the computer first.
[178:03.28]We may have reached the... the top?
[178:19.49]No, I was here before.
[178:21.33]Wait, what?
[178:22.99]Elevator.
[178:23.85]I'm going to get ammo.
[178:28.98]Wait, what?
[178:40.24]Did I miss something here?
[178:43.80]I was just up here.
[178:44.67]Duh.
[178:49.63]Well, okay.
[178:52.71]They have a window there.
[178:55.87]Nobody else.
[178:56.63]Let's see if I can just get through this quick.
[178:59.19]One, two, no!
[179:00.71]Wait for this guy to come around.
[179:09.78]That should be everybody, right?
[179:14.44]Is it boss battle?
[179:16.94]That's far enough, asshole.
[179:19.50]Well, look who's this.
[179:21.30]You must be that degenerate who's been killing us.
[179:23.29]That's right, and I've come for you.
[179:25.03]I really think you know all of this is going to play out.
[179:29.81]Pretty much.
[179:30.73]Go ahead, kill me.
[179:32.01]But us MEC will not be divided just because of my death.
[179:35.56]Brothers and sisters, we'll hunt you down.
[179:38.50]And then the Earth will be saved from ungrateful assholes like you.
[179:43.78]Nothing.
[179:44.50]You're wrong.
[179:45.24]The one who's getting hunt down will be you MEC bastards.
[179:49.33]Oh yeah, I'm so scared.
[179:50.63]We will see about that.
[179:56.15]Got it.
[180:04.75]Where's Garfield?
[180:05.47]No, I'm not doing Garfield.
[180:13.29]Ass.
[180:15.29]For slick.
[180:20.67]That was pretty cool.
[180:22.11]That was fun.
[180:26.91]That was Auto Angel.
[180:31.37]We'll do that one later.
[180:35.01]S for Should Do Garfield.
[180:38.37]This one's called Guest.
[180:40.85]I think you actually play as an alien in this one.
[180:48.57]By Error Finder.
[180:56.23]Yeah, see?
[180:56.63]I'm an alien.
[180:57.61]Oh, I'm dead.
[181:00.85]Movie's over.
[181:01.57]Alright, what do we got?
[181:12.06]Windows.
[181:17.50]Ooh, ooh, alright, okay, alright, easy now.
[181:22.00]Come down here.
[181:24.74]He ripped his head off.
[181:25.48]Let's watch out for the guy with the glass.
[181:27.34]Alright, I'm gonna say... I'm gonna have to... No, right here.
[181:32.56]No, right here.
[181:33.30]Come on.
[181:33.48]Come on, Dad.
[181:35.09]Come on, keep going.
[181:36.09]I can't catch up if you do that.
[181:43.83]What's left?
[181:50.44]Nobody else.
[181:51.38]One more guy.
[181:52.04]Through here, through here.
[181:52.94]Wait till he comes up.
[181:55.95]This is cool.
[182:00.65]It's cool being a little alien lobster thing.
[182:04.73]Okay, got it.
[182:15.63]Put your eggs in them.
[182:18.05]Right-click on them?
[182:23.13]What does right-clicking do?
[182:29.47]Ooh, this one's tough.
[182:38.63]So I'm gonna go down here, and then... Watch out.
[182:42.33]Watch it, watch it.
[182:43.45]They got a shot on me from a lot of angles.
[182:49.72]The guy with the pistol's gotta go.
[183:03.77]Alright.
[183:04.35]Two up top.
[183:05.53]One down below.
[183:07.06]That guy's a gun.
[183:10.66]Right click.
[183:11.42]Hold on.
[183:12.12]Let me get to the beginning of the next area.
[183:13.50]Because I'm almost done.
[183:14.20]And this is kind of tricky.
[183:16.64]See me through the window and come after me.
[183:19.67]Alright.
[183:20.13]Anybody else over here?
[183:20.89]Nobody in this window?
[183:22.89]Can't tell.
[183:24.45]No.
[183:24.89]It's just this guy.
[183:26.45]That's it for that line of sight.
[183:32.27]Get this guy.
[183:33.73]Wait, hold on.
[183:34.41]Easy.
[183:35.29]Somebody might have come to the line of sight.
[183:43.21]Alright, this shouldn't be too bad.
[183:44.70]Just to bait him out.
[183:51.48]Last guy.
[183:52.04]Come on over here.
[183:53.78]I guess I could wrap around the other side, couldn't I?
[183:56.46]That's what I... Actually... Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[184:07.14]Floor cleared.
[184:08.34]Alright, now I'm gonna right-click.
[184:10.10]I'll right-click on the next person.
[184:13.59]I didn't do anything.
[184:16.09]Right-click.
[184:23.05]Am I a scorpion?
[184:24.27]No, I'm an alien.
[184:29.06]Ooh, a lot of guys with guns up there.
[184:31.36]So, bait him down here, like this.
[184:34.02]What?! !
[184:41.50]How did you not... How are you not seeing me?
[184:46.64]Get a better look.
[184:48.22]Guy with gun.
[184:49.16]Hey, look at me!
[184:51.49]Hey, look at me!
[184:54.73]More... Okay, I gotta get the guy in the front first.
[184:57.21]And just wait.
[185:01.91]That's not right click, that's space.
[185:03.15]Okay, looks like melee, melee, melee.
[185:05.80]Guy with a gun in here.
[185:08.24]Easy now.
[185:09.86]Okay, watch out.
[185:15.54]Whoa, this glass!
[185:17.10]This glass!
[185:18.20]Okay.
[185:20.72]Stupid idiot!
[185:29.69]I just turned- what cartoon character did I just turn into?
[185:37.91]It's a stupid idiot!
[185:42.44]I didn't see- I didn't think they could shoot over the computers.
[185:50.00]What happens if I go down here?
[186:03.78]That happens.
[186:04.38]I gotta clear these guys out first.
[186:09.74]I thought I had it that first time too.
[186:11.04]It's too bad.
[186:20.25]Nooo!
[186:21.47]Oh, I got too greedy.
[186:22.53]Stop getting greedy and just do it!
[186:24.08]Just do it!
[186:30.64]Oh my lord.
[186:31.26]I can't- I got- I'm trying to do it too fast.
[186:38.45]Watch out, I got a gun coming over right now.
[186:44.31]Come in here.
[186:51.71]Another group.
[186:52.83]And then I should be able to go get the guy over there.
[186:56.59]Should is the real question, though.
[186:59.85]Okay, that's it.
[187:00.97]Guy in the middle right here.
[187:01.89]Hello?
[187:04.28]Almost died.
[187:07.18]That was real close.
[187:07.94]Okay.
[187:08.96]No more.
[187:09.40]I'm okay when they see me through there.
[187:12.22]Now I gotta wrap around.
[187:13.06]One guy in there.
[187:25.80]But how much can they see?
[187:32.60]Really?
[187:33.88]Really?
[187:34.66]You don't see me?
[187:35.87]You sure?
[187:44.07]See me.
[187:45.27]Look over here.
[187:46.89]Oh, fuck.
[187:50.20]I can rush him.
[187:58.80]I guess that's it.
[187:59.82]It's just him.
[188:00.32]Made him out?
[188:01.86]Come on.
[188:02.40]Maybe not.
[188:03.60]I'm kind of afraid to go over here, though.
[188:06.14]Well, okay, never mind.
[188:07.40]Right click on a corpse.
[188:35.18]Right click does not do anything.
[188:37.32]I can assure you.
[188:45.32]I'm in the vents now, that's funny.
[188:51.02]Whoa, I was in the vent!
[188:52.32]I really was in the vent!
[189:05.88]Okay.
[189:08.32]Hello.
[189:12.01]I'd like to right-click on the downed fat guys.
[189:15.05]Next time somebody says the word right-click... I'm gonna lose it.
[189:24.84]Whoa!
[189:25.46]Okay, that was weird.
[189:26.84]Weird door.
[189:35.83]The door really threw me off.
[189:50.60]I really... I like this level though.
[189:51.86]This level is actually really, really fun.
[189:53.14]The other one was good too.
[189:57.07]I like being the alien.
[189:57.89]Alright, I gotta bait... this guy up here.
[190:04.87]That's it.
[190:05.23]Just watch out for the weird door.
[190:10.95]Oh, fuck!
[190:13.07]I thought I checked down there.
[190:14.07]Was there somebody down there that I didn't see?
[190:31.46]Where was that guy?
[190:38.87]Interesting.
[190:39.55]Is it this person here?
[190:48.59]Windows.
[190:50.39]Guy with a gun down there.
[190:51.37]Okay, I got another opening here.
[190:54.81]I gotta pull you.
[190:58.11]That leaves one, two... They can... I... That's gonna be fine.
[191:01.58]I'll just go in there and click, click, click, click, click.
[191:04.84]Let's jump with that dude.
[191:05.80]Alright, let's go.
[191:06.28]Actually, I can pull him in through here.
[191:09.62]That works.
[191:10.12]It's like a shot.
[191:14.13]This guy's gonna see me and try to shoot me, and then he's gonna freak out and run after me.
[191:17.87]Here we go, one, two, three, go!
[191:19.01]No.
[191:19.69]Okay.
[191:21.71]Fine.
[191:23.89]Anybody else?
[191:31.12]That's it!
[191:31.82]Just this last guy.
[191:34.04]Another floor!
[191:37.24]Going good!
[191:40.73]Fat guy, fat guy, guy with a gun.
[191:42.76]Another guy with a gun.
[191:48.36]Pistol.
[191:50.52]Knife.
[191:52.02]I'm in a flow right now.
[191:54.72]I'm in a flow right now.
[192:04.35]Whatever.
[192:05.47]That was.
[192:06.31]And I started talking.
[192:08.53]And it fucking ruined everything.
[192:24.56]What?
[192:26.92]Just don't make any sense.
[192:31.99]Oh, they're all... It's a giant patrol.
[192:37.39]Really?
[192:37.77]Come on, man.
[192:40.45]So, I'm going to get the fucking patrol.
[192:42.95]No, I'm not.
[192:50.42]What?
[192:50.74]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[192:58.15]Alright, any more patrols and that's it.
[193:00.03]Okay, now I should be able to get this clean.
[193:08.74]Or so I thought.
[193:09.70]Alright, guy with a pistol, come on over.
[193:12.92]Stop fucking with my float.
[193:17.68]Holy fuck, there's a patrol.
[193:19.14]Oh god!
[193:21.72]Oh god, he can shoot through the wall!
[193:23.08]Oh boy!
[193:23.95]Okay.
[193:39.39]He's freaking me out.
[193:43.55]Way!
[193:45.19]Way!
[193:45.57]I didn't think he had a gun.
[193:53.48]I think it's just a patrol, and that's it.
[193:57.20]No, there's one guy up there.
[194:01.34]Alright.
[194:02.17]There's a window in here, so I'm gonna hide over there.
[194:05.49]Try to get the gun in front.
[194:10.96]No, it's too risky.
[194:11.98]Too risky.
[194:14.57]I told you it was too fucking risky.
[194:18.95]Stupid!
[194:19.83]That's what I was trying to do!
[194:21.43]Oh, stupid!
[194:22.71]Why?
[194:23.43]I was trying to... Come on!
[194:26.77]Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[194:28.86]What the hell?
[194:31.68]The fucking door!
[194:35.95]The door fucking ruins everything.
[194:37.81]Every time.
[194:38.79]Every time.
[194:39.31]Delete all doors from the game.
[194:42.34]I want to put a mask on that just removes doors.
[195:04.37]Space, please.
[195:05.03]What in the name of God?
[195:13.68]Here they come.
[195:15.14]Alright.
[195:15.60]I'm not going to fucking ruin this again.
[195:22.78]Just let them go around.
[195:23.48]I'm going to get a better... I have to get a much better position.
[195:25.56]I want to get the guy... You know what I'm saying?
[195:27.71]Just... I'll get him later.
[195:28.55]Let me get the rest of these guys over here.
[195:31.09]Only one dude here.
[195:33.92]And there's a couple people over here.
[195:35.72]Just don't take it slow.
[195:42.11]They have a gun?
[195:42.71]They're making their run around here.
[195:43.69]Alright.
[195:49.59]One guy up.
[195:51.19]And then I gotta get down here and kill the first guy.
[195:53.43]Let's make it so.
[196:02.44]Alright, I'll meet you down there.
[196:05.56]Here's the ambush.
[196:13.62]What is he... I'm supposed to be an alien.
[196:15.78]From the movie Aliens.
[196:19.09]I gotta kill a guy with a gun first.
[196:22.23]And then I'm just gonna... run.
[196:25.43]Here we go.
[196:26.29]No more talking, just action.
[196:33.25]Alright.
[196:34.31]Another floor!
[196:35.33]This one's long.
[196:35.97]Oh, alright.
[196:37.73]Is that it?
[196:38.41]What?
[196:38.69]Do I have to vent?
[196:40.03]Oh, that... alright.
[196:43.00]Beat it.
[196:43.46]I'm... I'm the winner.
[197:09.62]That was fun.
[197:10.42]That was very fun.
[197:12.16]That was called Guest.
[197:15.17]This next one is called Moonlight.
[197:19.05]S for Garfield.
[197:21.07]Maybe I'll get Garfield at the very end.
[197:27.99]These are fun.
[197:32.42]I want a whole alien video game.
[197:37.97]Moonlight.
[197:44.49]Okay.
[197:47.40]Well, okay.
[197:53.36]That guy's got a gun!
[197:54.24]Ooh, okay.
[198:05.80]Die, please!
[198:07.12]Ooh, look at that turn around!
[198:09.58]That guy's still alive.
[198:13.34]I just gave him a gun.
[198:14.62]What just happened?
[198:15.28]Why did I get more bullets?
[198:26.54]I think I got everybody.
[198:30.84]Unless, does that guy have a gun?
[198:33.95]Yep, he did.
[198:37.64]Ooh, dog.
[198:39.00]Does that guy have a gun too?
[198:42.20]Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
[198:46.21]Let's go up here.
[198:51.94]Let's go left?
[198:53.18]Yeah, let's go left.
[198:54.50]Okay.
[198:55.04]Right.
[198:56.86]Yeah, okay.
[198:58.22]Hey, Peter.
[199:00.25]I'm gonna need you to come in on Sunday.
[199:17.66]I fucking ruined everything.
[199:18.66]I don't know what to do.
[199:19.20]I don't know what to do.
[199:19.90]I'm just running away.
[199:20.76]I had it.
[199:27.91]I had it.
[199:29.55]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[199:34.21]It's unbelievable to me how angry I am.
[199:43.24]Gun, please.
[199:53.03]Thought I was dead it's all wrong I
[200:25.95]Get rid of that guy.
[200:27.96]He's gonna cause problems for me.
[200:36.56]Holy fuck!
[200:37.44]Okay, get him now.
[200:42.02]Oh shit.
[200:44.08]God damn it.
[200:47.34]Alright, anybody, any of the dogs?
[200:52.42]Just the two guys here, watch out for the glass.
[200:59.38]There's a lot of glass over there, and he can shoot through it.
[201:07.54]That's not glass, right?
[201:11.98]No.
[201:12.28]Alright, just this one guy?
[201:13.34]No, there's another guy over here.
[201:24.88]More people in here.
[201:25.74]What?
[201:26.12]Are you serious?
[201:28.04]Am I missing something here, guys?
[201:30.14]Who am I missing?
[201:33.50]Oh, that guy right there.
[201:36.84]The cigarette guy.
[201:39.84]Who's left?
[201:40.46]What?
[201:46.42]I just blinked.
[201:47.16]I hard blinked like six times.
[201:48.98]Okay, right there.
[202:00.46]Uh... That was pretty challenging, that was fun.
[202:05.64]Oh boy.
[202:06.32]Oh boy.
[202:10.64]Oh boy.
[202:17.33]Oh boy.
[202:19.33]Oh boy!
[202:19.55]Lots of windows.
[202:28.05]I think I have to go down.
[202:29.09]Wowly, wowly, wowly, wowly!
[202:33.31]Shit, come on!
[202:34.43]I was saying wowly, by the way.
[202:43.87]Wowly.
[202:48.76]Ah, oh, this is gonna be tricky.
[202:52.02]This one's gonna be tricky.
[202:58.14]I can't fucking believe it.
[202:59.24]Come on, really.
[203:00.10]Take care of that guy right now.
[203:12.92]I only got one bullet.
[203:19.88]Got a bush?
[203:20.48]Who has a gun?
[203:22.60]He's gonna attract people, though.
[203:28.87]I gotta be careful.
[203:30.97]There might be a dog in this level.
[203:34.21]Okay, got the big guy.
[203:42.04]I'm so paranoid.
[203:46.22]Got it.
[203:47.12]Okay.
[203:49.18]One guy up there.
[203:50.02]I think it's safe to stand here.
[203:51.84]It is.
[203:52.75]Oh, shit!
[203:57.65]Oh, I gotta be quick about this one.
[204:05.47]Oh.
[204:06.65]Okay, give me my gun back.
[204:21.22]Watch it, watch it.
[204:22.94]Yup.
[204:23.80]Asshole.
[204:27.29]Don't think so.
[204:28.15]I need another gun.
[204:37.74]It's just the left side that's left.
[204:39.03]Everything else is cleared out.
[204:40.67]But there are a lot of people here.
[204:50.92]Just blind firing.
[204:52.18]Thank God.
[204:53.12]That guy would have just fucking destroyed me.
[204:55.82]I need another gun.
[204:56.67]Whoops.
[204:58.61]Now I definitely need another gun.
[205:00.79]No, I want something better than that.
[205:14.36]Better?
[205:14.70]Okay.
[205:16.20]I can snipe that guy from here as long as I know where the hell he is.
[205:20.81]Oh, now I can.
[205:21.83]Shit.
[205:27.27]What the fuck?
[205:28.49]Oh, come on!
[205:29.41]The perfect fucking angle!
[205:32.47]What was that angle?
[205:33.73]My god.
[205:35.59]You gotta be kidding me.
[205:38.47]That sucks.
[205:42.47]I was being so careful, too, and just... He went through... Fucking windows.
[205:48.49]I need a melee weapon.
[205:57.65]Oh, fuck.
[206:21.25]My machine gun.
[206:21.93]I want the machine gun.
[206:22.77]I think I threw it too far.
[206:23.87]Can I hit this guy from here?
[206:27.57]No.
[206:27.87]Of course I can't do that, but they can.
[206:51.10]The enemies have a beeline, straight sniper rifle through every window, but mine's... I can't shoot an accurate... I... It's inaccurate!
[207:05.14]I gotta go down.
[207:05.80]God, you gotta be kidding me.
[207:37.59]It's just so huge!
[207:38.81]And there's so many windows!
[207:40.29]Fuck, I'm just getting sloppy now.
[208:16.25]Who did I just kill?
[208:17.27]What the fuck is happening?
[208:19.10]Where did those bullets go?
[208:34.13]Nowhere.
[208:34.77]It said I hit somebody, didn't it?
[208:42.99]Can't go over there.
[208:47.32]Fucking stupid door.
[208:55.71]Alright.
[208:56.69]You just watched that happen twice.
[208:58.95]That last one, why did it not hit?
[209:00.45]It's because I hit the door.
[209:06.75]All entryways and all doors and windows.
[209:10.26]Just get rid of them.
[209:11.96]Okay.
[209:18.34]No.
[209:19.76]He's coming to where... Where is he going?
[209:22.32]Apparently he's not going to come this way.
[209:26.87]Alright.
[209:28.15]Well, I kind of need a gun.
[209:31.63]You're kind of right here.
[209:44.57]At least now I can shoot this guy.
[209:57.87]You're up there.
[209:58.65]Whoa, watch out for this guy.
[210:04.04]Okay.
[210:08.94]Replace.
[210:10.22]Alright, I'm in a decent position.
[210:11.94]Just don't blow it.
[210:20.10]I just hate not being able to see.
[210:33.22]Oh my god.
[210:37.24]I can't talk.
[210:37.88]I don't know who you are.
[210:44.56]Who am I missing?
[210:48.17]Oh, in there.
[210:48.99]Who the hell is left?
[210:56.46]What random... Okay, that.
[210:58.22]The guy with the chainsaw.
[211:00.68]That's it, right?
[211:02.24]Okay, I need melee.
[211:14.20]Uh, after this, I gotta see why this person's calling me.
[211:17.84]So, I'm gonna have to take a second after this level here.
[211:26.79]One guy with a chainsaw, and then that's it.
[211:29.83]This guy with a cigarette, don't get fucking baited here.
[211:31.89]I'm just gonna throw this at him.
[211:40.58]Here we go.
[211:43.64]Alright, I didn't blow it.
[211:50.60]Uh... Alright, hold on, give me one second.
[211:52.64]Let me just make sure there's nothing important that I have to take a look at here.
[211:56.45]Give me one second.
[213:08.75]Alright, we're good.
[213:11.95]I do have the studio.
[213:17.15]So I just want to make sure it wasn't somebody from the studio trying to contact me about something, so... We're good.
[213:31.42]It was Hollywood!
[213:32.48]I have Mr. Hollywood.
[213:43.21]Uh, that's for the Christmas Eve stream, by the way.
[213:44.99]I'm gonna be in a big space.
[213:48.05]Because I need to have the space!
[213:50.92]Because... Wouldn't you like to know?
[213:55.00]I've been shooting that guy like three or four times.
[213:59.38]They should just die.
[214:07.35]Uh, there are a couple other things that I'm doing on that stream that are really, really stupid.
[214:15.82]Which requires the space.
[214:19.42]Dog.
[214:19.82]Alright, this is not a huge place.
[214:22.32]Is that guy a melee guy?
[214:24.93]I can't tell.
[214:25.37]I don't know.
[214:25.77]Is he?
[214:27.03]Might as well just pick up a melee.
[214:31.09]And I'm so paranoid about the one fucking guy down here being melee is he just go look I'm just gonna look cuz like what the hell No, he just not he's got like red eyes or something.
[214:39.30]What the hell was that for?
[214:40.30]Speaking of the witch
[215:05.54]Yummy!
[215:08.64]Where the hell?
[215:20.29]He blocked every shot.
[215:22.41]He blocked every shot.
[215:24.11]Well, nice job.
[215:25.45]I'm gonna have to take the shotgun.
[215:29.73]What do we got?
[215:33.40]Hmm.
[215:34.86]Dog.
[215:37.64]Pistol right here, though.
[215:48.80]Let's see what we got.
[215:50.72]Let's get rid of the dog.
[215:52.30]Because dogs are hard to deal with.
[215:57.61]And then... Up here.
[216:00.85]That's a silencer.
[216:04.55]What the fuck happened?
[216:05.43]Oh, wait, did he shoot that from?
[216:06.31]I don't know.
[216:06.61]I don't know what's happening.
[216:08.48]Okay.
[216:09.68]What?
[216:09.86]I don't get it.
[216:10.74]Oh, he shoot it there.
[216:12.98]Of all the fucking places.
[216:17.95]Just this guy?
[216:19.61]There's no windows there, right?
[216:21.05]There's nobody else in the room.
[216:23.39]No, just you.
[216:25.25]Okay, I got stuck.
[216:26.49]Can I just do this?
[216:37.26]Holy shit.
[216:38.24]Okay.
[216:41.04]Okay.
[216:46.65]Oh, fuck.
[216:47.27]Do I have a melee weapon on?
[216:53.07]Any more of those guys?
[216:53.75]Yep, one.
[216:56.25]There's one of those guys in the bottom right and a fat guy, so I'm gonna go... Let's go top right.
[217:02.84]We'll wrap around to the bottom.
[217:15.44]Nobody's going to walk up there, right?
[217:18.80]A couple of cigarette guys.
[217:19.94]Alright, we're going for that.
[217:23.00]Let's wait until he does it again.
[217:26.62]Got it.
[217:34.14]Gun on the table.
[217:35.42]We're going to go kick, shoot.
[217:41.29]You are here.
[217:46.39]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not a melee.
[217:50.58]Fucking come on.
[217:52.82]No, what?
[217:55.12]Oh my god, give me a break.
[217:59.13]And the guy's ducking too, oh my lord.
[218:02.33]What happened there?
[218:10.74]I'm in pain in the ass.
[218:30.30]I can't even go out there.
[218:31.04]Alright, where is he?
[218:34.43]I need a melee weapon, just take one with me.
[218:36.29]I can't even see one of my fucking ground right there.
[218:41.72]Let's get this motherfucker first.
[218:44.99]Really?
[218:47.19]locked on and everything but but remember he can shoot me in any angle no matter what the angle is it doesn't matter they will always hit you they don't have like a spread it's just dead
[219:23.59]Oh, yummy!
[219:59.40]Is that a melee guy?
[220:02.96]Like, I don't think so.
[220:07.04]Alright.
[220:09.24]Still going.
[220:12.18]What is this?
[220:14.72]Super shotgun?
[220:29.19]Uh, elevator?
[220:35.03]Silence.
[220:35.74]I mean, I had to be silent there.
[220:37.28]There's no way I'm gonna... Well, that's not gonna work.
[220:45.10]Uh, what's a melee weapon?
[220:47.20]Huh, okay.
[220:51.64]I need melee right here in the knife.
[221:01.66]That leaves with... give me that.
[221:03.75]Where are those guys?
[221:08.27]Money up there, and that's it, I think.
[221:10.69]I see a window.
[221:18.57]And then your friend over here.
[221:22.16]And get the money.
[221:25.02]Got it.
[221:28.00]That was tricky.
[221:31.67]That was very fun, though.
[221:32.61]Very tricky, but very fun.
[221:39.47]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[221:42.56]Dot, dot, dot.
[221:49.66]Is that not the car?
[221:51.46]That's not my car.
[221:53.16]You sure?
[221:53.52]This is not my car?
[222:05.37]What?
[222:07.11]It's where you came in.
[222:08.03]Yeah, but I mean, you think I remember that?
[222:11.26]I can't even... This level's like 25 minutes.
[222:13.86]I don't remember what happened.
[222:21.88]Go up.
[222:32.00]This is not it, right?
[222:37.97]This is the hardest part of the game.
[222:39.41]Is like, just trying to find the car.
[222:41.91]There's like six levels here.
[222:45.58]Why, why do you guys tell me to go up the stairs?
[222:47.42]Should I not be going down the stairs?
[222:48.84]Or go in the elevator and then down the stairs?
[222:56.38]Why does it keep wanting me to do that?
[223:01.95]Eh.
[223:05.80]This is down?
[223:07.48]It's hard to even tell which one is up and down.
[223:12.50]I'm all the way up now.
[223:16.37]This could be either one.
[223:17.47]This could be up or down.
[223:26.99]I love tongue twisters.
[223:32.17]North side of the bottom floor.
[223:34.55]Does the elevator take me to the bottom floor?
[223:35.95]Because this is the top floor now.
[223:44.92]I have absolutely no idea where I am.
[223:47.10]Alright, found it.
[223:48.06]I accidentally just found it.
[224:07.35]That was fun.
[224:09.67]So that takes us to... This is Patrol, Pain Train, and then Teenage... Let's do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[224:31.20]Okay.
[224:31.62]Roll dodge, killing punch, chainsaw, and guns.
[224:35.46]Or two machine guns.
[224:41.12]Roll?
[224:41.34]I don't want to do the roll dodge.
[224:42.44]Uh, how about two machine guns?
[224:45.72]Two machine guns.
[224:48.34]What?
[224:49.10]It's actually a Ninja Turtle!
[224:56.74]This is awesome.
[224:58.16]You have to make sprites for this!
[225:00.98]This is cool.
[225:12.80]Ooh, that one felt good.
[225:13.80]That felt good.
[225:23.33]Ooh, okay.
[225:24.19]Is it a pizza box?
[225:27.89]Oh, this isn't silver.
[225:29.17]This is cool.
[225:29.81]Alright, I only have 36 shots left.
[225:42.55]Ooh, got me, okay.
[225:44.75]Got there.
[225:45.25]I wasted so many bullets on that.
[225:51.98]So this editor seems... pretty elaborate.
[225:55.34]Uh-oh.
[225:55.96]I don't think I can... I need a gun.
[225:57.90]Shit.
[225:58.00]Alright, well now I know he's there.
[226:17.02]Uh-oh.
[226:18.36]That was just fun to do.
[226:27.56]You know, I don't care if I lost.
[226:28.89]It was fun to do.
[226:35.57]I gotta get... This is the nunchuck.

[227:16.93]What?
[227:17.03]Is this... What?
[227:23.91]Is the dog killing me?
[227:35.82]Shit.

[229:07.84]Nobody got hit by that.
[229:09.30]Nobody did.
[229:10.56]No one.
[229:13.52]Oh, and I'm dead.
[229:22.56]This one's giving me so much trouble.
[229:38.97]Alright.
[229:39.25]Let's go around this way.
[229:44.04]This dumb dog.
[229:52.93]Did you see that, like, World of Warcraft NPC ship?
[229:55.45]He just, like, changed directions six times in not even a second.
[230:09.37]Can I have the shotgun?
[230:15.65]It's not gonna pull everybody, right?
[230:16.49]No.
[230:16.55]Alright, I gotta be ready for the last guy.
[230:18.61]The last guy's the one that's a problem.
[230:19.75]I need a melee weapon, I think.
[230:21.57]What?
[230:22.16]The shotgun?
[230:24.00]I don't... Have I ever seen one of those enemies before?
[230:30.40]Oh no.
[230:31.64]Thank god.
[230:32.58]Is it a melee?
[230:39.11]Is it a melee?
[230:43.29]Do I have to melee this guy?
[230:44.71]Yes, I do.
[230:45.69]I do.
[230:46.07]That's it.
[230:56.66]Alright, keep going.
[231:03.64]What the hell is this?
[231:06.77]Bullshit.
[231:19.25]Dodge, did you see that dodge?
[231:21.31]Did you see that inhuman dodge?
[231:23.59]That wasn't even human and I know it was a dog, but still.
[231:49.89]Oh my lord.
[231:50.59]Watch out for the dogs.
[232:00.44]What did you hear?
[232:21.09]Where'd he go?
[232:21.59]Where's the dog?
[232:23.25]Fuck, that was tough.
[232:29.34]Okay, I gotta go.
[232:30.32]I'm going the other way, I think.
[232:32.04]Yeah, I'm gonna wrap around this way.
[232:34.43]I'm gonna get myself destroyed.
[232:36.21]Dog, that's number one reason why.
[232:37.91]What's he got back here?
[232:40.33]Oops.
[232:43.18]I knocked over your octopus, I'm sorry.
[232:56.11]What?
[232:56.51]Does... I'll take the shotgun.
[232:58.53]That sounds good.
[232:59.05]Nobody up and nobody down.
[233:11.53]One here.
[233:16.95]That was almost really bad.
[233:21.80]It's not an octopus.
[233:23.36]Well, it looked like one.
[233:26.99]Holy shit, Michelangelo is fucking dead.
[233:36.20]Who are you?
[233:39.54]Wait, are you?
[233:40.52]Holy shit, I didn't know you actually exist.
[233:44.14]Why are you acting weird?
[233:46.69]Look, you don't need to hurt me or anything, just go.
[233:48.99]Please, leave me alone.
[233:56.42]Secret!
[234:00.85]That was Shredder.
[234:04.61]That was cool.
[234:05.57]I like the TMNT gimmick.
[234:08.11]It was good.
[234:09.97]Good job.
[234:26.77]That was Socrates?
[234:32.44]Yeah, well, he sucks anyways, don't worry.
[235:10.29]Whatever.
[235:10.81]I don't know.
[235:11.79]Okay?
[235:15.07]I'm just so... I'm not focused on the direction I'm going.
[235:17.57]I'm focused on the enemies.
[235:18.61]And it's a lot of mental work.
[235:22.31]Why can't there just be an arrow pointing where you need to go?
[235:26.27]It's all just gray arrows.
[235:27.91]I don't remember where the fuck I came in.
[235:30.63]I have absolutely no idea.
[235:36.76]I don't remember any of this.
[235:49.41]Get me out of here, there's the exit!
[235:56.56]Oh my fucking god, it was this.
[235:59.70]That was the car.
[236:13.87]That was good.
[236:15.43]Alright.
[236:16.31]We'll do, we'll do compact.
[236:18.88]Here it comes.
[236:34.19]Cherubim985.
[236:34.43]Is that just me?
[236:42.92]Wow, that's actually really, really cool.
[236:44.44]I... I'm dead.
[236:56.31]Holy shit, that's a lot of people!
[236:58.01]Ooh, alright, I gotta shoot him.
[237:08.68]That takes so long to do that.
[237:18.68]Alright, what do we got?
[237:20.20]I can't tell what's down there, but there's a lot of... There's only one guy with a gun?
[237:24.35]No, this is safe.
[237:25.97]Just bait him out.
[237:36.25]What's in there?
[237:36.73]Okay.
[237:44.77]Empty, empty, empty.
[237:45.85]Another big guy, so I gotta be aware of that.
[237:50.35]I gotta kill this dude first.
[237:52.91]And then take care of the big guy.
[237:54.11]Is that a beer?
[237:57.11]That's awesome.
[238:05.43]Whoa!
[238:08.09]Okay, floor clear.
[238:12.15]That's great.
[238:14.83]What's up here?
[238:16.43]Couple more Vias.
[238:20.81]Did you make this in two days?
[238:22.45]I'm not sure if they're watching or not, but that's pretty awesome.
[238:33.78]Oof.
[238:34.64]Alright, I gotta stay behind here.
[238:48.20]Alright.
[238:49.68]Uh, that's clear.
[238:50.56]Ooh, don't get caught.
[239:00.61]Shit.
[239:02.53]I'm so paranoid about that guy!
[239:08.43]Whoo!
[239:09.85]Close.
[239:10.56]Alright.
[239:11.18]They can shoot through that.
[239:12.48]Hold on.
[239:14.45]Nobody there.
[239:14.85]There's one guy right there.
[239:16.40]He's got a melee weapon.
[239:18.78]You gotta be kidding me.
[239:19.84]That's so awesome.
[239:21.04]I can't fucking believe Glue Man is in this.
[239:24.96]That's so... That's ridiculous.
[239:27.26]That's amazing.
[239:28.28]Well done.
[239:30.78]Am I gonna go kill Glue Man?
[239:32.16]Alright, what about through here?
[239:38.83]There's a guy with a gun.
[239:46.42]Oh boy.
[239:50.19]I gotta pull you, you gotta get over here.
[239:52.89]Alright, floor cleared.
[239:57.91]I can't kill- Holy shit.
[240:14.30]No, no, that's an alternate universe.
[240:16.78]This is an alternate... That is not real.
[240:27.35]There's more here.
[240:28.01]Okay, what's up here?
[240:34.26]Oh my god.
[240:35.12]This is too much.
[240:44.59]Is that Otto?
[240:45.83]No, I'm not gonna say that.
[240:54.11]Any windows?
[240:55.18]Only a few.
[240:55.80]What's that?
[240:59.32]What?
[240:59.66]Who is that?
[241:00.86]I can't tell from here.
[241:01.82]Who is that?
[241:02.32]Is that Santa?
[241:12.69]Wow, that's so cool.
[241:13.93]Alright, I'm going in here.
[241:14.69]I want to look at other stuff.
[241:15.91]I want to look at this level.
[241:23.60]Whoa!
[241:24.46]Oh well.
[241:27.48]It's because Santa had a chainsaw in the rumble.
[241:31.69]Attention to detail.
[241:33.35]It's wonderful.
[241:45.99]Hold on here.
[241:46.51]Here comes another group.
[241:51.13]Oops.
[241:59.67]Ooh, did I get him?
[242:00.61]No.
[242:02.67]Did I get him?
[242:03.45]No.
[242:03.61]I think that's good.
[242:05.53]There's one more dog.
[242:06.87]Which is gonna see me if I walk over here.
[242:10.30]Gonna be ready for the dog.
[242:14.84]Dog incoming.
[242:17.15]Doggone.
[242:21.11]Oh, wow.
[242:22.09]No way.
[242:22.59]I thought I got that wave before he did.
[242:33.38]I'm going too fast.
[242:34.04]Alright, he's taken care of.
[242:44.59]One more patrol coming down.
[242:47.51]He's getting impatient.
[242:49.51]I know.
[242:53.29]That should be enough of that.
[242:55.35]I can actually walk over here now.
[242:59.00]I'm not sure I want to.
[242:59.96]Is that gonna come?
[243:01.24]Oh fuck, there's another dog.
[243:02.34]Oh fuck.
[243:04.58]It's alright.
[243:05.92]Where'd he go?
[243:11.98]Is the disco diaper lying down?
[243:15.01]Still there.
[243:23.05]Can I get Santa from here?
[243:24.11]Oh, shit.
[243:28.49]What is Santa?
[243:28.93]Santa has a chainsaw, right?
[243:30.91]Alright, come on, Santa.
[243:31.59]Let's go.
[243:32.59]You and me.
[243:34.85]No, you... Santa's gone.
[243:42.18]Couple of Bias.
[243:45.78]Two Bias up here.
[243:51.57]Just this one dude.
[243:55.60]And then the two Biaz.
[243:58.10]And that should bring me to... I gotta get easy hits here.
[244:12.95]Got it.
[244:15.55]Oh, this one person remains.
[244:19.57]Wait, glass.
[244:20.61]Nope.
[244:22.28]Thought you were trying to fool me with the glass.
[244:26.74]Got it.
[244:29.64]That was compact.
[244:30.71]That was the... That was great.
[244:40.69]I know how to get out of this one.
[244:59.45]Hardest part of the level.
[245:00.19]That was fantastic.
[245:01.13]Thank you for that.
[245:02.51]B+.
[245:07.75]That was a lot of work that went in.
[245:08.99]A lot of work went into all these.
[245:11.75]Excellent job.
[245:16.16]So that leaves us with Patrol and Pain Train.
[245:21.30]I guess we could do Patrol.
[245:27.69]Don't worry, I'll get Garfield.
[245:29.43]We'll do Garfield before I turn the stream off.
[245:34.85]Garfield will be the last one that I attempt.
[245:44.54]So, let's do Patrol.
[245:48.22]By Plank.
[245:57.11]Alright, so that's me.
[246:00.13]Sniper rifle.
[246:04.49]I can't shoot.
[246:05.31]I can't.
[246:05.73]Just rewind.
[246:07.19]I can't rewind.
[246:08.66]No rewinds are allowed.
[246:10.18]Actually.
[246:12.70]Actual game mechanics.
[246:29.22]Alright, let's try a different approach here.
[246:31.78]Just give me an open door.
[246:42.86]Really?
[246:48.24]Whoa, what?
[246:49.36]Who shot me?
[246:50.08]What the hell was that?
[246:52.82]This guy shot me through there?
[246:53.92]I have no idea who's shooting me.
[247:04.25]Who's shooting me?
[247:08.09]What?
[247:12.67]Is he standing up?
[247:21.83]Is it a... It's a turret?
[247:23.89]Bush?
[247:28.55]It's not this guy, is it?
[247:34.03]Is it this guy?
[247:34.57]I don't know.
[247:39.69]Maybe we'll find him later.
[247:47.81]I like the sniping aspect of it.
[247:55.49]Oh, I thought that was a wall.
[248:02.51]So I can snipe you from here.
[248:03.93]Okay.
[248:11.28]That leaves... That guy right there.
[248:18.50]What the hell is... Uh-oh.
[248:28.72]Can I even kill these guys?
[248:31.19]I think these guys are turrets.
[248:35.02]I think that's actually by design, I think.
[248:36.84]I'm pretty sure.
[248:44.40]Maybe I can melee the turrets?
[248:47.01]Because if I go like this... Oh boy.
[248:55.29]He's just not turning?
[248:56.49]Well, wouldn't I be able to shoot him then?
[249:12.26]No, those guys are definitely supposed to stay alive.
[249:24.49]So I can't go this way.
[249:25.37]I gotta go the other way.
[249:26.17]Once I take out this big dude.
[249:29.15]Once the big dude is dead, what about this way?
[249:31.64]I guess I can wrap around.
[249:34.26]Or no, I can't.
[249:39.46]How am I supposed to get in there?
[249:40.22]This guy shoots through here.
[249:43.63]I gotta get a good spot to shoot this guy?
[249:46.31]Hmm.
[249:49.21]Find the... Let's see.
[249:58.70]Alright.
[250:00.48]Now I wonder if I can just walk up here?
[250:02.62]And then down?
[250:05.95]Huh.
[250:11.21]Whoa!
[250:17.97]Melee, melee, melee, melee.
[250:20.07]Well, I have to get close enough before I can do that.
[250:21.81]I'm gonna take these guys out again.
[250:44.02]Let's try it again.
[250:49.52]Okay.
[250:51.14]Let me try doing that again.
[250:53.13]I have to shoot this dude.
[251:06.09]No.
[251:07.16]Get in here, but I can't stand here.
[251:10.80]Can you shoot through the door?
[251:11.92]I feel like you shot through the door last time.
[251:16.57]No, it was somebody else.
[251:17.57]Oh, fuck.
[251:19.28]Oh, man.
[251:21.18]I think I can... Shit.
[251:30.75]So who is this?
[251:32.23]I don't even know what guy's shooting me.
[251:35.03]Because this guy dies.
[251:45.52]Where's the other big guy?
[251:50.18]He's right there, so I'm gonna have to snipe through... this hole?
[251:54.36]I feel like I kinda have to.
[251:58.16]How do I line that up?
[252:12.07]Like, is he gonna shoot me if I go like that?
[252:20.17]Through there maybe, but I think that's gonna be hard to get over there.
[252:22.91]I think I can do it from... Is there like a better angle?
[252:26.87]I don't think so.
[252:34.46]I'm gonna have to run in and shoot through here, right?
[252:41.08]Like this.
[252:42.90]What the fuck?!
[252:43.89]Who the hell are- Why are you standing?!
[252:45.75]Whoa!
[252:46.35]What the- That just scrambled my brain!
[252:58.25]What the hell?
[253:03.95]I actually... Alright, so... What the fuck?
[253:12.45]Just come out here so I can figure this out again.
[253:14.22]What in the name of God?
[253:15.84]Alright, so they have to melee that guy.
[253:17.78]And they're not just turrets.
[253:19.58]They're not turrets.
[253:21.58]So I...
[253:28.47]Oh, I didn't even shoot that guy.
[253:29.71]Alright, here we go again.
[253:50.34]So now, um, maybe I should just shoot the wall and bait this guy?
[253:57.31]Okay.
[253:59.05]That changes things.
[254:09.10]Come on.
[254:10.50]Just shoot him.
[254:12.36]Just shoot the fucking guy.
[254:27.25]Well, the reason I thought it was a turret is because they were shooting backwards and they weren't doing any animations.
[254:32.79]So, I mean, what am I supposed to think?
[254:36.93]Alright, let's take a look.
[254:41.19]I don't think there's any way I can get shot in here.
[254:47.05]I'm just gonna pick this guy off.
[255:00.15]Fucking dumb door!
[255:12.53]Lily, you... give me a break.
[255:32.85]So then fuck it.
[255:33.45]Just do this.
[255:34.85]Why would I ever even do this?
[255:35.81]Just attack them.
[255:38.37]They're not like turrets.
[255:39.37]Just go like this.
[255:46.29]Maybe I can go in that room now.
[255:58.79]Someone snuck up on me there.
[255:59.71]Alright, then you're here.
[256:05.32]I think somebody's coming out here.
[256:06.62]I can't get off that.
[256:07.26]Okay.
[256:14.34]So now I'm safe to go up here and into this room.
[256:17.22]Because this guy's not here anymore.
[256:18.36]So let me see what's available up here.
[256:19.85]Hmm.
[256:31.26]I guess I could just pull them.
[256:33.16]But this takes a while to switch back.
[256:34.61]I gotta be careful.
[256:42.45]Okay.
[256:44.39]Anybody have line of sight?
[256:45.63]Nope.
[256:45.93]But this guy... Is he stand... I don't... Is that guy standing?
[256:49.85]Nope.
[256:50.27]Not anymore.
[256:57.34]Okay.
[256:59.64]Not much left.
[257:12.35]One guy.
[257:14.19]Nope.
[257:15.45]More than one guy.
[257:16.16]I'll wait for you.
[257:23.74]That leaves just you.
[257:24.64]Okay.
[257:40.11]Sorry.
[257:45.28]well okay let's try this way whoa alright I think I have to pull you first well the right idea I didn't how the hell
[258:14.01]Jesus, really?
[258:15.22]He saw me through here.
[258:17.16]There's one more guy over there, but let's see if I can kill this dude right now.
[258:20.32]Got it.
[258:21.68]Hmm.
[258:22.74]Now where?
[258:23.30]I'm gonna go this way.
[258:33.71]Really?
[258:35.41]That sucks.
[259:07.28]No, what the fuck?
[259:08.89]I'm trying to right-click.
[259:25.15]Okay.
[259:29.15]Gotta get the fat guy here.
[259:30.15]I'll just bait these guys up and kill them.
[259:41.03]Oh my looooooo- What killed me?
[260:02.64]What?
[260:02.92]Did I get shot?
[260:04.70]This guy down here.
[260:05.64]Go fuck yourself, guy.
[260:15.78]Oh my god, I thought I had a knife.
[260:31.09]Really?
[260:32.66]What is... what are you talking about?
[260:35.58]What the fuck?
[260:36.42]Come on!
[260:38.16]Oh boy.
[260:46.15]Just kill me.
[260:46.63]I have to wait until he stands, but I can't see when he stands.
[261:01.00]I can't move.
[261:04.71]Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[261:15.78]Happens every fucking time.
[261:17.24]Let's try this again.
[261:40.21]So, one of these guys has a gun.
[261:41.57]I gotta slow down.
[261:46.68]I don't have any ammo.
[261:47.58]Oh no, that's not good.
[261:48.50]Is there ammo down here somewhere?
[261:49.54]Is there anybody left down there?
[261:52.24]Am I getting shot?
[261:53.51]Oh god, please let me know.
[262:04.03]Someone's coming up here, eh?
[262:16.50]Good thing I have ammo right next to me.
[262:18.86]That makes this a lot easier.
[262:25.02]So where's the last guy?
[262:25.82]Isn't there... a pig or something?
[262:34.17]Oh.
[262:35.09]Holy shit, that... Good thing I didn't move.
[262:38.71]Oh my god.
[262:40.21]That's so lucky that I didn't move.
[262:42.25]I need to get to a good spot because this guy...
[262:57.19]what the hell you gotta be tethered right like that threw me off so bad why did he tether at the door
[263:39.30]He like ran right to the edge of the door and then just insta-turned around and went back.
[263:46.50]Well, now I have to go back down here.
[263:48.58]Wasn't there somebody else over here?
[263:52.31]This guy right here.
[263:58.65]I'm gonna kill this guy first, because... Oh, fuck.
[264:16.83]Not this time.
[264:19.99]Just go stab him in the fucking head.
[264:23.35]That's not it.
[264:23.89]Who's left?
[264:24.63]What's happening?
[264:25.67]Oh, there's one guy right here.
[264:26.85]Nah, give me ammo.
[264:39.76]Oh dear.
[264:45.50]Oh dear.
[264:56.87]Can I go this way?
[264:57.63]I can't go that way.
[265:09.20]Hmm.
[265:11.04]He's gonna have line of sight on me here, isn't he?
[265:12.40]Fuck, that's so... That's so weird to do.
[265:18.68]Trying to like keep it on him across so far.
[265:40.52]Fuck.
[265:41.66]Is he?
[265:42.36]No, he didn't have a gun.
[265:43.06]Good.
[265:53.99]Okay, let's see.
[265:56.69]That guy.
[265:58.47]All the way at the end there.
[265:59.62]That would have killed me.
[266:02.87]I need ammo.
[266:03.93]Oh shit.
[266:07.35]Shit!
[266:11.51]Can he shoot over here?
[266:12.29]Alright, we're good.
[266:29.04]This is tense.
[266:32.80]Alright, one melee guy down there.
[266:35.72]I have to shoot this guy.
[266:37.70]I have to stick my head over this way and see if I can bait him to stand up.
[266:40.71]Which I did.
[266:41.41]I didn't shoot him, though.
[266:46.35]Come on.
[266:49.25]Am I not waiting long enough?
[266:55.60]Apparently not.
[266:56.68]Alright.
[266:58.60]Fat guy...
[267:08.72]Take care of this guy right now, but anybody have line of sight?
[267:11.19]They don't.
[267:11.73]So let's see if I can't kill this guy.
[267:16.79]Oh my god!
[267:17.59]What was I doing?
[267:18.45]Oh, I fucking tried to... Oh my god!
[267:23.22]I fucking didn't run at him.
[267:24.82]I was too busy thinking of the... whatever.
[267:29.24]Oh, now I'm just rushing.
[267:32.29]God damn it.
[267:37.59]For some reason, I don't know why, my brain right there, I just... Like, that guy was a melee.
[267:42.05]Because I said, oh, melee!
[267:43.75]That's a melee guy!
[267:44.62]Alright.
[267:49.36]How did I do this?
[267:51.94]Just kill this guy right now.
[267:55.36]And also, after you shoot, it takes a full almost two seconds before I can switch back to the knife.
[268:00.82]So, and I'm not compensating for that.
[268:24.82]Alright.
[268:25.58]Where the hell am I gonna shoot here?
[268:26.83]I gotta shoot him.
[268:37.31]What the fuck?!
[268:41.45]Why did he not chase after me?
[268:42.85]Why is it always the guy, like, down here?
[268:45.79]This guy doesn't want to chase me?
[268:47.99]Well, the guy up top does.
[268:51.21]What the heck are you talking about?
[268:59.93]I'm in trouble here.
[269:00.69]I need to get that off.
[269:21.58]I gotta worry about this guy.
[269:23.54]I may have just screwed myself.
[269:28.48]Wait till he turns around, and then I'm just gonna run over and get it, and then run away!
[269:31.26]Let's take care of him.
[269:40.73]Alright, back where we were before.
[269:44.29]Two guys up there, the melee guy down here.
[269:48.01]Alright, I gotta get rid of you, so let's do that.
[269:55.38]Now let's try to make this happen.
[269:59.99]Did I already get... Nope.
[270:01.01]Make sure I get this dude.
[270:02.11]Alright.
[270:08.85]Come on now.
[270:10.51]I mean, I guess I could rush, but... Okay.
[270:20.40]I'm actually gonna... How many bullets do I have?
[270:23.04]One bullet.
[270:23.86]Not good.
[270:25.06]Let me try to shoot...
[270:27.27]Am I going to hit anything with this?
[270:28.77]Okay, I'm going to go for it.
[270:30.29]I'm going to try to hit the pig.
[270:31.79]I wonder if it's going to run into anything.
[270:32.89]I'm so fucking dumb.
[270:53.26]Alright.
[270:54.22]That's it.
[270:55.40]What?
[271:00.73]That's an interesting spawn.
[271:11.82]Can't go over there.
[271:17.42]I have to run- I have to run in and stab this guy again.
[271:20.73]Oh boy, this is gonna be tricky.
[271:23.19]Okay... Hup!
[271:25.49]Ooh... I thought it was a- I thought it was a cube.
[271:34.04]I need to save this bullet.
[271:37.59]For the pig guy.
[271:38.39]Okay, he's done.
[271:48.53]There is one more guy with a gun that's in a current patrol.
[271:51.56]Alright.
[271:54.16]What do you got?
[271:54.68]Let's see it.
[271:58.80]Don't have anybody else here.
[272:03.25]Oh, shit.
[272:03.83]Okay.
[272:05.13]Am I safe right here?
[272:05.87]They can't shoot through these, I don't think.
[272:17.10]Leads me to here.
[272:18.36]When I shoot this, this guy's gonna come running.
[272:32.75]Fuck.
[272:34.46]I have to hit this.
[272:35.04]That's a weird angle, though.
[272:40.79]I'm gonna wait till they turn around.
[272:41.63]Okay, got it.
[272:51.95]Nobody else down there.
[272:52.71]There's a pig down there.
[272:56.28]Can I shoot through that?
[272:57.96]We're about to find out.
[272:59.66]Yep.
[273:00.40]Oh, fuck!
[273:02.26]Oh, I didn't think you could run through it!
[273:04.92]Oh, come on.
[273:06.04]I didn't think you could like run through that for some reason.
[273:08.09]I thought it was a wall.
[273:09.13]Oh, whatever.
[273:12.51]So long.
[273:14.09]So much patience.
[273:20.43]I had it too.
[273:21.11]That sucks.
[273:28.87]Where's this other guy?
[273:45.25]Same deal, I'm gonna go the other the same way.
[274:04.91]Get them both?
[274:05.63]No.
[274:06.23]Alright, same deal.
[274:07.35]I'm gonna need ammo.
[274:09.71]I think there's ammo right there.
[274:10.89]Come here, you.
[274:17.72]There's an ammo box up here.
[274:20.12]Alright.
[274:21.13]Come on.
[274:25.23]Who else?
[274:26.99]Alright, there's one sniper guy there, and there's one melee guy here.
[274:30.35]I need to... I need to...
[274:39.01]Did you see what just happened there?
[274:39.85]Holy shit!
[274:40.95]I just switched too fast.
[274:43.12]One last guy.
[274:43.90]I don't want him to shoot me, though.
[274:45.72]He's gonna get line of sight on me and he's gonna kill me.
[274:48.12]There's a wall.
[274:48.86]I have to shoot him from here.
[274:55.85]Is this a wall?
[275:00.97]This is another area.
[275:03.63]Holy fuck.
[275:05.45]Go?
[275:09.40]Wait.
[275:10.44]Why did I want to go here?
[275:17.64]Oh boy.
[275:20.72]Now what?
[275:21.94]I think I did it.
[275:30.55]That one was fucking hard.
[275:33.61]The difficulty wasn't in... Oh, how many enemies there were.
[275:36.05]It's just placement and needing to stand in the right places.
[275:41.05]I'll take a C- on that one.
[275:42.41]Alright, this is the last one.
[275:48.05]This one's called Pain Train, and then we're gonna play Garfield.
[275:51.09]I'm gonna play, like, just the first, like... We'll see how far I get in Garfield.
[275:57.70]It's called Pain Train.
[276:08.06]Alright, what do I get?
[276:12.38]Uh, I don't know.
[276:16.47]I guess we just go?
[276:19.19]Punch?
[276:21.41]Oh.
[276:22.41]See how I tried to avoid those because I thought they were walls?
[276:26.01]Fun fact!
[276:27.83]Why did this guy not shoot?
[276:34.52]Take his gun.
[276:43.59]2-2.
[276:44.73]Anybody hide in the trash?
[276:47.25]Who did I hit?
[276:47.87]I just shot the pizza.
[276:56.13]Ooh, well that wasn't good.
[277:07.34]Alright, we're good.
[277:10.36]We're good.
[277:21.15]More?
[277:21.99]Oh, boy.
[277:22.61]Okay.
[277:23.01]We're just going through.
[277:24.75]Who's... Okay.
[277:31.86]That's it.
[277:32.48]Just gotta smash him in the head.
[277:40.96]Nothing over here?
[277:45.94]Good thing I... That was in the right time, because I would not have done that.
[278:02.01]Couple of guns.
[278:04.74]There it is.
[278:05.06]Floor cleared.
[278:06.46]Fast.
[278:06.94]We're moving fast.
[278:07.64]Let's go.
[278:09.58]Oh boy.
[278:18.12]Shit.
[278:18.46]I gotta hit that guy.
[278:20.38]Forget about that.
[278:38.49]Oh fuck.
[278:40.37]Ahhh, I got caught up.
[278:57.02]Guy standing there.
[279:06.68]Melee.
[279:09.73]Hmm... Oh, this is a silenced gun.
[279:16.11]Whoa, fuck!
[279:16.81]Whoa, no, I can't punch him.
[279:18.74]Oh, shit.
[279:19.48]Okay.
[279:20.70]Damn it.
[279:22.72]I screwed that up.
[279:31.52]What the fuck?
[279:39.09]I just- how did I miss every shot?
[279:59.43]Okay.
[280:02.80]Um... I have to hit that guy with a melee weapon.
[280:09.00]So, let's go ahead and bring a melee weapon down here.
[280:11.12]What do you say?
[280:16.56]Is that the only guy that has that problem there?
[280:21.07]Dog!
[280:31.90]Sorry, that dog, like, just blew up my blood pressure.
[280:42.01]This is a weird room.
[280:43.49]Oh.
[280:53.21]Somebody's still alive.
[280:54.81]Who?
[281:11.52]Didn't say floor cleared.
[281:12.46]It doesn't usually say, but, uh, area cleared?
[281:32.23]Uh, okay.
[281:36.52]Leave area.
[281:37.44]Oh.
[281:38.42]I did, alright, I did.
[281:39.70]What?
[281:41.74]Does this count?
[281:47.20]The door was the last enemy I had to kill the door I think that's it
[282:12.30]Do I have to go back through the train?
[282:13.82]What can I- Is there another way- ways from- What?
[282:30.82]What are you- what are you talking about?
[282:35.63]Where am I supposed to go?
[282:40.47]The bus stop?
[282:44.78]So I need to go here.
[282:46.16]What?
[282:49.30]Alright.
[282:56.02]It's the sofa bus stop.
[283:07.91]A sea?
[283:09.68]I got 104,000!
[283:09.94]I had a 92,000!
[283:12.16]I went over the max score!
[283:13.46]How is that not like an A?
[283:17.62]Alright.
[283:19.38]It's time to show- It's time to do Garfield, and then I'm gonna- I gotta take a break from this game.
[283:24.88]In fact, that's pretty much the end, right?
[283:27.86]I beat it.
[283:35.62]So, let me go get, uh, Garfield.
[283:42.27]Shouldn't take me more than a minute or two here.
[283:43.91]Okay.
[283:51.06]Workshop.
[283:51.54]So if you're curious what we're doing tomorrow, we're going to do a giant everybody join Atlas.
[284:04.69]If you have it.
[284:05.47]Video game night.
[284:07.63]That's the pirate game.
[284:11.99]The pirate game.
[284:12.80]Is there a reason why I can't search the workshop right now?
[284:23.72]Okay.
[284:33.15]Search the workshop.
[284:37.05]Why can I not?
[284:38.95]Atlas was delayed until Friday, really?
[284:42.45]Huh.
[284:45.67]Why the fuck can't I search the workshop?
[284:58.12]What happened?
[285:07.66]OK.
[285:08.34]I think this is it.
[285:12.03]Yeah, Garfield Campaign.
[285:13.53]Alright, I've installed it.
[285:19.09]Just need to restart the game.
[285:22.13]I can't believe I'm gonna play the Garfield fucking campaign.
[285:35.75]I think I have to... Maybe I can just restart?
[285:39.39]Let's see.
[285:44.37]Yeah, I gotta restart the game.
[285:48.93]December 21st?
[285:54.55]I gotta go back to the doctor on December 21st.
[286:01.43]I was planning on doing that tomorrow and then taking Friday off to go to the doctor again.
[286:05.71]And then... Well, that kind of changes things.
[286:14.45]Let me open this.
[286:22.51]Yeah, and pardon me if I sound a little tired today.
[286:26.47]I was up at about 4 o'clock in the morning, because... Every time that I have blood taken from my body, I just... Every time I have, like, blood work done, especially when it's, like, six or seven full vials, I just pass out.
[286:40.64]I get so tired.
[286:43.26]So if I sound a little tired, I apologize.
[286:47.24]But it's time for Garfield.
[286:51.53]Why is Garfield not here?
[286:52.43]Uh-oh.
[286:59.45]Garfield?
[287:06.25]There it is!
[287:07.15]Okay, Garfield.
[287:10.71]What the fuck?
[287:13.70]I... I don't know, which one do I want?
[287:17.90]Lasagna?
[287:19.62]Lasagna... er, lasagna is lasagna-oid and lasagna... fuck.
[287:29.20]I don't know which one of these to do.
[287:31.95]I don't know why I'm doing this in the first place.
[287:36.21]What is the... is this gonna... Okay, here's the lasagna.

[288:23.48]I hate this already.
[288:32.62]I love this at the same time, though.
[288:34.30]I...
[288:40.34]Oh boy, they got guns.
[288:41.88]They got guns!
[288:44.59]Can Garfield use a gun?
[288:47.51]I'm not sure Garfield can use a gun.
[289:00.01]Nothing about this is... Nothing feels right about this.
[289:02.42]I need melee.
[289:14.26]No, John!
[289:15.43]It's okay.
[289:28.47]Alright, got a gun.
[289:32.05]Two guys, one at the door.
[289:35.59]And level clear, go to car.

[289:48.62]Alright, let's go.
[289:53.92]Hey John, I got me some lasagna.

[289:59.00]I'm gonna take a nap.
[290:03.86]John, do you hear me?
[290:05.24]Can you understand what I'm saying?
[290:07.55]It's over, Garfield.
[290:08.37]It's all over.
[290:09.15]I've got no money left on my account.
[290:10.59]We're officially broke, Garfield.
[290:12.46]You finally did it, you fat cat.
[290:14.36]You ate us into poverty.
[290:16.52]Oh boy, John, look.
[290:18.06]Like the time has come for you to get a job.
[290:21.26]Don't you dare put this on me, you greedy, lazy piece of cat shit!
[290:25.38]Your insatiable appetite caused this!
[290:28.21]You fat cat!
[290:30.37]Sure, blame the cat on your financial distress.
[290:33.51]Now put my fucking lasagna in the oven, John.
[290:37.12]No, Garfield, it's over.
[290:38.86]Never again will you have control over my life, you despicable trash.
[290:42.60]You're outta here, you're out!
[290:44.28]Goodbye, Garfield, I'm throwing you out!
[291:00.37]What?
[291:04.06]What just happened?
[291:04.82]What?
[291:08.74]What?
[291:17.17]What the fuck?
[291:19.23]This went, this went in a completely different direction.
[291:22.67]Dear Garfield, if you're reading this, it means I'm, I'm mostly, what?
[291:29.23]Oh.
[291:36.69]What the fuck is happening?
[291:39.01]My son.
[291:39.23]I have a son.
[291:39.69]Yes, you're a father, Garfield.
[291:40.93]25 years I've kept his existence.
[291:41.71]I'm still getting over what just happened.
[291:48.27]It's fucking with me.
[292:04.71]It is time for you to sort that mess out all by yourself.
[292:07.07]His name is Tony.
[292:08.15]He lives at the 61st Street 10 minutes.
[292:13.25]Or at least he did the last time I heard of him.
[292:16.65]I love you, Garfield.
[292:17.45]What happened to us?
[292:18.47]Okay, this is... I don't like this.
[292:20.48]Perhaps we'll see again.
[292:24.84]Jesus Lord Almighty.
[292:26.02]I actually have an illegitimate son.
[292:29.82]Oh, fuck.
[292:30.24]I need to sit down.
[292:43.48]I fucking hate Mondays.
[292:44.82]Is this supposed to be Garfield?
[292:47.32]Thank God I don't have a job.
[292:48.48]That'd make it even worse.
[292:50.80]Oh, dude, Tony, you're laying on my piss rag.
[292:54.29]Oh, shit.
[292:54.69]No, this is... Sorry, I didn't realize.
[292:57.85]It's... Okay.
[292:59.39]I can just pee my pants.
[293:03.31]You... You got mail.
[293:06.25]Yeah, nice.
[293:06.93]Is that...
[293:17.28]play Garfield.
[293:18.04]It'll be fun.
[293:19.08]Nah, it's a letter.
[293:23.61]Okay.
[293:24.61]From who, I wonder?
[293:25.33]I must get to the bottom of this.
[293:26.83]Alright.
[293:31.25]Oh my god.
[293:32.27]Oh, that's great.
[293:33.98]Spit it out.
[293:34.62]Who is Kaiser Soze?
[293:36.44]Alright, can I just play the game?
[293:44.98]Play Garfield.
[293:46.91]Play the Garfield one.
[293:52.30]Can you tell me what it says?
[293:53.48]I can't read.
[293:54.72]Sure thing, citizen.
[293:55.94]Let's see.
[293:57.14]Hello, Tony.
[293:57.54]My name is Garfield.
[293:58.22]We need to meet.
[293:58.96]I recently found out something about you and me.
[294:01.62]And, uh, I don't know what I should say.
[294:03.38]Let's just meet up, okay?
[294:04.90]Well, what does it say?
[294:06.40]Some guy named Garfield is requesting a meet-up.
[294:09.55]Last house on the left.
[294:10.55]Bring lasagna.
[294:11.57]Lasagna?
[294:12.03]Why?
[294:12.21]That's my favorite food.
[294:13.09]How odd.
[294:13.95]Should I go, detective?
[294:15.77]Yes.
[294:16.65]Okay.
[294:17.73]Tony, if you're going out, bring me more lipstick.
[294:20.93]Okay.
[294:28.04]Okay.
[294:30.64]Uh... I'm kind of lost right now.
[294:37.91]I like this song.
[295:05.46]This is a lot of fat guys.
[295:14.20]That's it.
[295:22.27]A guy with a gun.
[295:23.09]How am I gonna get rid of this guy?
[295:24.19]I have to pull him out.
[295:36.27]Okay.
[295:40.63]What is that?
[295:42.01]What is going on right now?
[295:45.53]Well, that guy has a gun.
[295:52.27]Come on.
[295:59.27]Delta just says, Florida.
[296:00.60]Ow.
[296:14.70]Uh-oh, guns!
[296:18.12]Whoa, whoa!
[296:24.53]Wow.
[296:31.65]Odie.
[296:35.38]No, window.
[296:36.54]We gotta be careful, because that guy will... I have a gun?
[296:38.58]No, a knife.
[296:52.54]Okay, hello Tony.
[296:54.21]I'm Garfield.
[296:55.57]I'm your father.
[296:58.27]Dad?
[296:59.90]You're a fucking house cat.
[297:13.78]Well, I've got to admit, I'm at a loss of words, Pops.
[297:16.44]Sorry for using the phrase fucking house cat earlier.
[297:19.45]It made me sound like I'm disappointed or something, but it's just... It's okay, Tony.
[297:23.83]I understand.
[297:25.21]I, too, was pretty shocked at first when I learned I had a son.
[297:28.11]I have no memory of your mother.
[297:29.33]Don't recall ever having sex with a human.
[297:31.97]Must be due to that stroke I had.
[297:35.41]Yeah, I never met her.
[297:36.35]I was raised by stray cats, and now those...
[297:48.22]I'm not going to read this.
[297:50.12]I think it's... And how about the stray cats?
[297:59.89]They taught me how to fight and hunt.
[298:01.75]We got along quite well.
[298:03.47]How I see they were my channel to my feline roots.
[298:08.87]My father is a cat.
[298:10.13]It all makes sense.
[298:12.35]I'm glad you feel that way.
[298:14.01]What do you do for a living?
[298:16.18]Nothing.
[298:16.50]I mostly spend my days sleeping, and sometimes I punch some dudes with my friends.
[298:21.62]You truly are your father's son.
[298:22.86]I'm proud of that.
[298:24.24]Well, no one's ever been proud of me before.
[298:25.81]You really mean that.
[298:27.63]Sends a soulmate in you, Tony.
[298:29.15]Can I be your dad?
[298:32.23]You've always been my dad, Garfield.
[298:34.43]Neat.
[298:35.01]Happy days are ahead for both of us.
[298:36.67]We're going to do much better than me and John.
[298:39.38]Who's John?
[298:40.54]Oh, my owner.
[298:41.52]You had an owner.
[298:42.94]Duh.
[298:43.36]How do you think a house cat is supposed to maintain itself?
[298:46.58]John's old news.
[298:47.88]No.
[298:48.88]Oh, God.
[298:49.54]You mean... It's fine.
[298:52.36]He was an ass.
[298:54.49]What made him... Oh, God.
[298:59.63]I can't...
[299:07.81]Let's go have some father-son time.
[299:11.24]Teach me how to ride a bike.
[299:13.04]No, I'm a goddamn cat.
[299:17.26]You got a car, what do you need a bike for?
[299:18.68]Yeah, well, I guess it's just- I think it'd be a useful skill.
[299:23.01]Riding a bike.
[299:24.49]Yeah, okay, we'll do something else.
[299:27.71]Okay, something more fun.
[299:28.69]Let's go.
[299:35.08]What did you just walk into?
[299:37.28]I haven't... I'm not sure yet.
[299:38.72]I haven't figured it out.
[299:46.61]You haven't moved an inch while I was gone.
[299:48.07]Have you seen this crap?
[299:50.11]Entertainment for cats.
[299:59.11]I wouldn't do that for a million lasagnas.
[300:01.67]You know, we could do something together for a change.
[300:04.13]Like what?
[300:04.37]It's raining.
[300:04.83]It's been raining for three days.
[300:06.66]It's a perfect weather to sit indoors, relax, and just watch dumb VHS tapes.
[300:11.58]I'm thinking something.
[300:12.16]Come on, Pops.
[300:12.90]I want to get to know you better.
[300:15.34]There ain't much to know.
[300:16.40]I eat and sleep and screw around.
[300:17.96]That's about it.
[300:19.45]No one is that one-dimensional.
[300:20.77]Come on, let's go and just drive around and talk shit.
[300:26.33]What the fuck is happening?
[300:37.75]Is it still on fire?
[300:38.77]That's not good.
[300:45.27]Here, kitty.
[300:46.11]Meow.
[300:47.50]What'd you just say to me, punk?
[300:49.82]Hey, nice.
[300:50.40]You can talk.
[300:51.52]Maybe imagine it.
[300:52.20]It's kind of hard to tell.
[300:53.44]Are you high?
[300:56.16]Good for you.
[300:58.74]Now, excuse me.
[300:59.46]I've got to go out in the rain with my son.
[301:03.01]Ha, son of Garfield.
[301:04.31]Boy, that Jim Davis never runs out of ideas.
[301:08.28]They're talking about you on the streets.
[301:11.92]What are they saying?
[301:13.00]You are a fat cat and wonder why you are so fat.
[301:15.52]Apparently they're quoting some video or something.
[301:18.16]I don't know.
[301:18.56]Don't care.
[301:19.00]How's Orson?
[301:21.69]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[301:23.61]Hey, we were supposed to go get going.
[301:26.47]If I can make a recommendation, you should check out that new perfume shop.
[301:29.85]Oh, the odors they sell.
[301:33.94]Okay, sounds like a plan.
[301:34.94]The quicker we go, the quicker we can get back.
[301:36.75]Thanks, mister.
[301:38.59]Godspeed, fat cat.
[301:43.81]Nassim.
[301:45.92]Uh, okay.
[301:50.58]Go after the bad guys, Garfield.
[302:09.27]There's three more levels after this one?
[302:13.21]There's an entire fucked up Garfield campaign.
[302:19.85]Now I need a gun.
[302:24.47]Oh dear, okay, I gotta go right, left.
[302:33.37]Shit.
[302:35.45]Is this fan-made?
[302:36.37]Yes.
[302:37.69]So, Hotline Miami 2 introduced a level editor, which allows anybody to make a full campaign.
[302:48.54]Oh, I need a melee.
[302:49.14]Oh, dear.
[302:53.38]Oh, I didn't think I got him.
[302:54.84]I gotta switch it.
[303:01.89]Oh, man.
[303:06.31]My gamer fatigue is exponentially growing.
[303:15.04]Now give me the gun.
[303:32.55]Whoa.
[303:36.65]I need some gamer juice.
[303:38.07]No, I'll be okay.
[303:47.68]Hello?
[303:48.00]Are you gonna... Hello?
[303:52.34]What the hell?
[303:53.10]Really?
[303:54.88]Fine.
[303:55.46]I'll just throw a knife at your head.
[303:56.68]Alright, that is melee.
[304:03.51]That guy's got a gun.
[304:05.13]That's not melee.
[304:07.77]So let's pull you, itchy nose.
[304:13.40]I gotta shoot in here.
[304:14.18]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
[304:20.32]Empty, empty!
[304:38.39]Okay.
[304:43.21]Really?
[304:43.75]Is this stuck in the door?
[304:45.53]Alright, this guy's not melee.
[305:00.13]The guy down there is, though.
[305:01.71]So I need- da da da da da!
[305:11.19]I think that's it.
[305:12.99]It is.
[305:13.57]One last guy.
[305:14.21]That one's another one.
[305:19.71]Where's the last guy?
[305:24.46]Oh.
[305:25.04]Okay.
[305:30.46]There's a Shrek campaign.
[305:31.92]There's a lot of... I think there's a lot of content here.
[305:36.27]There's a lot of community-made stuff.
[305:39.89]Uh, what was I coming back here for?
[305:42.38]Do I have to, like, tag him out?
[305:44.66]Tag team?
[305:46.65]Ow.
[305:46.73]Woo!
[305:46.85]That's also a gun.
[306:15.25]Back to the car, okay.
[306:26.96]The Shrek, no, I'm not gonna do the Shrek campaign.
[306:30.56]I don't know if I'll be able to make it through this one.
[306:38.86]You done with that cig?
[306:40.16]Are you smoking?
[306:42.87]Just about, we're going back home.
[306:46.09]It was great to finally meet my father after living without him for 25 years.
[306:50.83]I had two big expectations about how life would turn out to be after that.
[306:54.66]Yeah, well, I admit I'm still kind of amused about this whole father thing, but I'm trying my best.
[307:02.68]I hope your presence will help me shape up.
[307:06.09]But instead, we continue to sit on our asses and do nothing.
[307:09.23]But isn't that what everybody wishes they could do?
[307:11.93]Have no responsibilities, do what they wish, and be their own master, not me.
[307:16.74]I hate Mondays.
[307:18.14]Me too.
[307:19.22]Because I'm jealous of people who get to go to work.
[307:23.56]Uh, just enough to take off.
[307:29.14]It's okay, that's what parents are for.
[307:32.11]You want to take a sniff of this perfume I got?
[307:34.60]What?
[307:35.00]It's a real killer.
[307:36.48]I haven't smelled anything like this before.
[307:40.40]What?
[307:40.70]This is a mind-blowing product.
[307:43.68]Oh, it's drugs.
[307:46.94]I said no!
[307:48.99]Okay, take it easy.
[307:50.01]It's just a perfume.
[307:53.49]I'm getting soaked.
[307:59.73]Read it all!
[308:07.73]I'm so overstimulated already.
[308:10.85]Wait a minute.
[308:15.44]What the fuck is going on?
[308:18.38]Who the fuck was that?
[308:23.90]What's going on?
[308:24.60]It was a suit.
[308:27.18]Uh, what?
[308:27.66]He was one of them.
[308:28.50]It was a suit.
[308:30.65]He's spying on me, looking from the shadows.
[308:38.15]How the fuck did he get here?
[308:39.54]Oh, I'm gonna get him.
[308:40.90]Dad, calm down.
[308:41.50]Maybe you're just seeing things.
[308:42.74]I'm not.
[308:43.12]There was a suit in our house.
[308:45.04]Quickly after him before he gets away.
[308:48.90]I see you there through the window.
[308:50.94]I'm gonna teach not to mess with the motherfucking Garfield.
[308:55.68]Dad!
[308:56.30]Garfield!
[308:57.10]Wait.
[308:57.82]Ah, shit.
[308:58.50]God damn it.
[308:59.74]Not like this.
[309:11.26]Oh my goodness.
[309:12.92]Oops.
[309:13.78]I got stuck.
[309:14.35]There's two there.
[309:19.85]I can go get one, two, three.
[309:21.71]Come on out.
[309:52.16]throw something at you I can't really really really we want lasagna well you're getting it right now aren't you isn't this what you wanted
[310:37.76]Come on.
[310:38.40]Oh, what the hell?
[310:39.16]I just got baited so hard.
[310:40.18]Trying to go too fast.
[311:10.98]I can't go out there and kill him.
[311:18.25]He's gonna come in here.
[311:21.01]Damn it.
[311:21.51]Man, I can't walk out there.
[311:22.69]If I walk out there, I'm dead.
[311:30.22]I'm actually gonna go... I'm gonna... I am gonna go that way.
[311:43.50]Man, really, I'm just trying to rush too fast.
[311:45.33]I had it really well the first time, too.
[311:46.85]This sucks.
[311:57.75]Really?
[311:58.17]Come on.
[311:58.59]Why did it not shoot me the first time?
[311:59.95]Alright, get down here, then.
[312:10.20]He did come down.
[312:10.92]What?
[312:24.85]More than just- yeah.
[312:25.73]Okay, that's what I wanted.
[312:27.27]I'm gonna go down.
[312:35.74]Fuck.
[312:38.20]That one guy with the gun is such a pain in the ass.
[312:44.60]I think I do have to go that way though.
[312:52.35]Oh boy.
[313:02.18]Where is he?
[313:04.77]Oh fucking come on, what?
[313:05.95]Where did you come from?
[313:07.91]Did you walk all the way over here?
[313:09.43]That is such bullshit, what?
[313:31.35]Last guy right here.
[313:38.17]I'm gonna go down.
[313:44.32]Oh, no!
[313:46.10]No!
[313:46.76]Oh, I thought that's... Oh, I'm gonna have to take a break.
[313:53.03]I'm starting to feel the, like, gamer throw up.
[314:03.12]There's only so many hours you can play one of these like fast-paced super Twitch spin around and hit everybody don't make any mistakes games where you actually diarrhea your pants.
[314:37.38]I'm so drunk.
[314:38.37]I'm drunk so it's worse.
[314:41.45]I can't imagine playing this game drunk.
[314:45.59]I don't think I would get out of the first two rooms.
[315:06.47]Down to... Yep.
[315:07.81]Okay.
[315:11.11]Floor clear!
[315:11.69]Uh... Looks like we're going over this way.
[315:25.05]Eat that, you piece of poop.
[315:27.97]It's time to calm down.
[315:28.91]Oh, can you believe this shit?
[315:29.93]How'd this happen?
[315:30.55]I mean, how long have these suits been for, I guess?
[315:34.50]I have no idea, but you should try to relax.
[315:36.52]Here, smell my perfume.
[315:37.56]It'll soothe your nerves.
[315:38.96]Damn it, look around you.
[315:39.90]Something sinister is going on.
[315:41.12]I want to get to the bottom of this.
[315:45.40]Why do you keep offering me that bloody perfume all the time?
[315:49.80]Just this once, please, Dad.
[315:50.72]I promise it'll help you concentrate.
[315:52.22]What is going on?
[315:52.90]Why does everyone want to do this so bad?
[315:55.55]Fine, hand it over.
[316:04.22]Oh, it stings.
[316:05.22]Jesus.
[316:06.02]Oh.
[316:06.92]I'm sorry, Dad.
[316:09.50]Oh, fuck.
[316:10.06]I can't see.
[316:10.66]God damn it.
[316:13.54]I told my nose I wouldn't take this shit.
[316:18.47]Ah!
[316:19.91]I...
[316:25.86]See the rings of Saturn.
[316:28.38]What is happening to Garfield?
[316:39.37]What the fuck is happening?
[316:41.69]I'm so... I'm... I would have more to say about this if this wasn't five and a half hours into this game.
[316:55.02]I'm puking.
[316:55.64]What the fuck's going on?
[316:56.94]Shouldn't you ask?
[316:58.33]What is going on?
[317:00.95]What?
[317:01.21]Hee hee hee.
[317:02.49]John Arbuckle?
[317:05.93]I just did.
[317:06.95]How are you alive?
[317:08.73]Or did I, Garfield?
[317:09.79]I beg to differ.
[317:12.45]In fact, I'm feeling better than ever seeing you in that cage.
[317:16.20]This was all just theater, wasn't it?
[317:17.90]You didn't... You didn't... Tony isn't my son.
[317:23.56]Oh, he is your son, alright.
[317:24.94]And without him, I wouldn't be sitting here getting my revenge.
[317:28.10]I'm sorry, Dad.
[317:28.70]He made me do it.
[317:29.31]I had no choice.
[317:31.11]You could have said no.
[317:33.43]Fuck, I guess I could have.
[317:34.67]And you, John, what could you possibly seek revenge for?
[317:38.31]For years of torment, goddammit.
[317:40.15]I was your owner, Garfield, but you always treated me like shit.
[317:45.35]You're the most egotistic, self-centered asshole I've faked by death and sent you to find your long-lost son, Tony, so you could see what it feels like to take care of a worthless cat like you.
[317:57.08]Huh, so you thought.
[317:59.50]Instead, we ended up bonding quite well.
[318:02.76]Yeah, kinda.
[318:04.78]Also, I'm a grown-ass man.
[318:06.08]I don't need my daddy looking after me.
[318:09.28]Then I decided I should just get rid of you.
[318:11.80]Tell me, Garfield, who was Tony's mother?
[318:16.04]Hell if I know.
[318:17.68]Well, I do.
[318:19.29]It was Liz.
[318:24.93]You mean that vet you were always hitting on?
[318:27.09]You know that damn well.
[318:29.35]We've been on her clinic a million times.
[318:34.39]And every time you struck out.
[318:36.21]Imagine the anger that boiled inside me two weeks ago when I found out you had been sleeping together.
[318:42.54]Liz tried to hide your son from me by letting the...
[318:58.27]Hurry up with the exposition.
[318:59.86]What's your endgame, John?
[319:02.28]Me and my catnip society will turn you into lasagna and serve to the poor.
[319:06.64]How delightfully ironic is that?
[319:09.12]Bastard, so you are going to kill me, huh?
[319:11.46]Just like Odie.
[319:15.00]Odie had to be put down because you kept kicking him off the table.
[319:19.45]Don't try to put that on me, Garfield.
[319:21.41]Nobody likes you.
[319:25.09]Dad, my revenge will be complete.
[319:27.09]Thank you for all the years not.
[319:29.53]Put him to sleep.
[319:31.79]No!
[319:43.48]What the?
[319:44.20]Ow.
[319:44.48]Oh fuck, they've thrown me into an incinerator.
[319:47.94]Like in the Bond film.
[319:51.76]Help, somebody.
[319:53.84]You are not Garfield.
[319:57.28]Just leave the incinerator.
[319:58.56]The hatch is open.
[320:00.35]Oh, alright.
[320:00.77]I'm trusting you, rubber chicken person.
[320:02.43]Don't let me down.
[320:03.23]The stones of happenings tell your future.
[320:16.64]And what do they say?
[320:18.56]An old friend.
[320:23.04]I swear to God, if Heathcliff is in this fucking game.
[320:30.67]Dr. Liz, we'll see you now.
[320:32.01]Uh-oh, we have tapes and magazines.
[320:34.47]Put it in this tube.
[320:37.59]What?
[320:39.63]Wait, hold on.
[320:52.51]You got something in your eye.
[320:53.79]Hey, don't worry about it.
[321:02.47]Uh... It's a giant maze.
[321:14.54]No way, that's not happening on this stream.
[321:17.30]I'll tell you right now, absolutely not.
[321:25.27]Hi, Odie.
[321:35.89]Woof, woof.
[321:36.95]Thanks, you too.
[321:40.27]I know.
[321:40.59]Get going, then.
[321:56.25]Go over there.
[321:57.25]Turn left where you see dark light on the right.
[322:10.13]Oy.
[322:11.87]Oy!
[322:12.63]The door is open.
[322:14.03]Oy!
[322:15.05]Oy!
[322:18.62]This is lasagna- lasagna fuck.
[322:35.75]Woo!
[322:36.55]Got him.
[322:41.99]He's left down.
[322:43.01]Uh, I need melee.
[322:50.86]Let's go ahead and pull him.
[322:56.80]That's it, floor clear.
[323:00.88]Go, go, go.
[323:26.16]I need melee, but I need to get rid of... Hmm.
[323:28.90]I need melee.
[323:31.46]Wait, is there any melee weapons up here?
[323:33.80]Well, I threw that one outside.
[323:35.06]That was fucking brilliant.
[324:05.49]Keep going, Garfield.
[324:06.43]Kill the cat.
[324:09.91]Fuck, I need a gun.
[324:11.91]Shit.
[324:48.06]Shit.
[324:48.38]Is it bullets?
[324:49.94]One bullet.
[324:50.66]No.
[324:51.06]Wait, I gotta get rid of this guy.
[325:10.94]There's that fat guy.
[325:12.00]There he is.
[325:16.76]He's got a melee weapon.
[325:18.04]This guy has a gun, though.
[325:20.46]And a knife right here.
[325:21.46]Let's see if I can... Can I pick it up?
[325:26.87]Can I pick the knife up?
[325:28.13]No, don't even try it.
[325:29.03]Just get a melee weapon down here.
[325:30.65]Does anybody have a melee weapon down here?
[325:33.47]Uh-oh.
[325:34.49]No, there we go.
[325:42.18]Wow, I missed!
[325:49.50]Is this a mod?
[325:50.02]Yeah.
[325:51.58]This is the Garfield... The Garfield campaign.
[325:54.94]It's on the Steam Workshop.
[326:09.17]Where does this one go?
[326:19.88]The red arrow was for here, wasn't it?
[326:30.15]Am I crazy?
[326:30.85]There's an elevator?
[326:33.69]Where's the elevator?
[326:51.88]I mean, clearly the red arrow was telling me to go that way, but... If you saw an elevator... Oh, okay, well... Just follow the red arrows!
[327:01.66]Just follow the red arrows!
[327:05.18]I was following the red arrows!
[327:06.41]Come on!
[327:07.21]That's not my fault!
[327:11.97]Come on!
[327:25.73]Come here, come here, come here.
[327:29.25]There he is.
[327:30.95]I need a... A knife.
[327:36.03]Alright, John.
[327:39.84]Garfield!
[327:42.20]Garfield, think about what you're doing.
[327:43.72]Remember all the good times we had.
[327:45.28]Like the time I drank... All the wacky times.
[327:50.75]Remember those?
[327:53.23]Yeah, I do.
[327:54.03]So thanks for all the years.
[327:56.67]That's it.
[327:58.41]What?
[328:16.09]Hey, Garfield.
[328:17.29]Oh, hi, Tony.
[328:18.10]They're showing the fly on TV.
[328:20.06]Why do I still have my eyes bugging out of my head?
[328:23.09]Oh, that's a good movie.
[328:24.55]Grab a cold one, son.
[328:30.77]You know, they shot an alternate ending for this.
[328:33.61]Oh, yeah?
[328:36.56]Yeah, Veronica has a dream of her baby with butterfly wings.
[328:39.50]Oh, that's beautiful.
[328:40.50]Especially after all the gruesome things.
[328:43.42]Uh, yeah.
[328:44.08]It's kind of, uh... Burp.
[328:56.37]Well, there we go.
[328:57.05]I love the... Garfield created by Jim Davis.
[329:04.87]Did you notice the continuity error in this campaign, by the way?
[329:07.63]Tony first says he's thankful of being unemployed, but later he says he's jealous of people who have jobs.
[329:10.95]That kind of shit happens when you work without a notepad.
[329:12.94]And don't write down your story, apparently.
[329:14.38]Or is it a continuity error?
[329:15.58]Maybe Tony was just trying to impress his hobo friends.
[329:18.12]Sadly, we might never know the true background of this mystery.
[329:19.96]Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed and check out my other campaigns.
[329:21.62]A brave man is a man who dares to look the devil in the face.
[329:25.80]James Garfield.
[329:27.96]Well, that was outrageous.
[329:40.60]It was absolutely outrageous.
[329:42.56]I think that's a great one to go out on.
[329:46.06]Well, Garfield actually said that, yeah.
[329:54.56]Although it's actually surprising to see just how high quality and worthy of being in the game type of content that people are making.
[330:14.81]And I don't think I even scratched the surface.
[330:18.29]There's a lot.
[330:21.21]Too bad you were too cowardly to read half the story.
[330:31.04]I'm not going to play the Shrek one.
[330:34.36]Maybe one day you'll just- no.
[330:35.86]I'm not gonna- I'm not playing Shrek.
[330:39.34]You can call me a coward all you want, I'm not gonna play the Shrek campaign.
[330:52.43]Coward, coward, coward, coward, coward.
[330:59.67]Call me a coward.
[331:45.13]John drank dog.
[331:49.65]No, I'm not saying it.
[331:53.27]Why?
[331:54.41]My god.
[331:56.51]No, alright.
[331:59.87]No, that's not a coward because I don't want to say- because if I say that, then I get to be edited in a hundred thousand different ways.
[332:42.38]I don't... What a load of bullshit.
[332:45.09]Well, time- Alright.
[332:48.71]Hey, good night everybody!
[333:02.63]That's where we're gonna end.
[333:04.63]Thanks for coming out to the stream.
[333:14.59]That's where we're gonna end.
[333:18.69]See you next time!
[333:21.29]It's just an expression, what's saying I'm going to go Jack it.
[333:29.42]I'm concerned for the future of content than when I press the, when I click the button.
[333:47.28]Alright, I gotta take a break.
[333:48.88]I do.
[333:49.21]I can't play this game for more than like six hours.
[333:52.77]It's a great game.
[333:54.43]Maybe you'll see Shrek start the next stream.
[333:58.03]So, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do tomorrow.
[334:01.03]I'm gonna have to come up with something.
[334:02.53]Because my plan was I was gonna play Atlas tomorrow.
[334:09.92]But that has been delayed.
[334:14.18]So, we'll figure something out.
[334:17.70]I have a couple of potential ideas.
[334:21.78]Play Shrek.
[334:22.34]Alright, I will play this Shrek campaign tomorrow.
[334:26.51]Okay?
[334:27.97]But we're doing something else after that.
[334:34.57]Somebody in all capitals called me a liar.
[334:37.41]Well, you're gonna have to tune in tomorrow.
[334:40.85]We got him.
[334:42.22]No, you don't.
[334:43.10]But I didn't say how long I was gonna play it for.
[334:48.84]Why make this?
[334:52.48]This campaign probably took like 30 hours of work to make.
[334:56.95]You know what?
[334:58.61]Fuck it.
[334:59.33]I'll make it my own campaign.
[335:01.05]I'm gonna make my own Hotline Miami 2 campaign.
[335:03.11]And we're gonna play it.
[335:04.94]It's gonna be terrible.
[335:19.26]But, goodnight everybody.
[335:20.97]I'll see you tomorrow.
[335:22.85]Final thoughts on Hotline Miami as a series.
[335:27.93]It's a great series.
[335:32.09]The first one, I enjoyed a little more than the second one's campaign.
[335:37.35]But the second one had way more content and much more to do.
[335:39.63]It was way harder.
[335:43.14]Both very, very good games.
[335:44.46]I would highly recommend them.
[335:50.00]Wrong overlay, oops.
[335:54.01]Well, that was embarrassing.
[335:57.55]Two has the better music.
[335:59.89]I mean, they're both great.
[336:01.85]I would probably say the first one's not as difficult as the second one.
[336:07.53]Second one's a lot larger.
[336:10.62]There's a lot more enemies.
[336:12.20]People are off screen.
[336:13.04]There's a lot more windows and more doors.
[336:17.94]I like this new end screen.
[336:19.20]Oh, that's right.
[336:19.72]It's just pulling from Shrek.
[336:26.07]And there's a, the two is worth purchasing for all the community content for sure.
[336:29.69]There's so much, you know, Shrek and Garfield themed campaigns.
[336:40.73]But with that, we are going to wrap it up.
[336:42.27]We're going to do the bits.
[336:47.99]And let's actually put on the real goodbye music.
[336:51.57]What do you say?
[336:51.97]Because this is a little too upbeat, I think.
[336:56.05]Yeah, there we go.
[336:57.45]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[336:58.15]If you're taking off.
[337:01.83]We'll figure something out.
[337:05.65]Hey, Germa258.
[337:07.60]Thanks for the $1 help.
[337:11.14]I just escaped from Jerma's basement.
[337:12.78]I'm one of his many clones.
[337:14.44]He had me make outdated Fortnite references for him, and it was horrible.
[337:21.16]Thank you, uh... Outdated.
[337:25.48]How could you make an outdated Fortnite reference right now?
[337:28.22]It's like the biggest thing in the world.
[337:33.60]Fortnite is the biggest thing on Earth.
[337:38.51]Thank you, TheYellowist, for the three bucks.
[337:40.19]Hotline Miami, one half?
[337:43.41]Or half worth the buy?
[337:45.63]One and two worth the buy, yes.
[337:48.86]Yeah, he's saying 1 and 2 are worth the buy.
[337:51.94]Doesn't this game go on sale all the time, too?
[337:59.50]Doesn't it typically get picked up in some of those sales?
[338:07.00]Yeah, absolutely.
[338:08.38]If you're up for a challenge, there's plenty to challenge you in both of these games.
[338:13.12]And they're just fun anyways, so.
[338:16.18]I would say yes.
[338:16.92]Thank you, The Eloist, for the $3.
[338:18.48]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[338:20.86]Just hopping in to give a little bit of that Garf love.
[338:23.61]Hoo-wah.
[338:24.45]Check me out, Jerma.
[338:25.09]I'm doing the Garfield dance of good fortune just for you.
[338:28.05]I'm just word vomiting right now, but then again, would a Garfograph be a Garfograph without it?
[338:32.25]Does anyone know the power you have with a Garfograph?
[338:35.17]Garfographs have the power to make Jerma say anything Garf wants.
[338:38.83]Well, as long as it's nothing legally binding or morally Garfed up somehow.
[338:42.83]Jerm, would you consider me a mortal cat?
[338:45.06]Chaotic neutral.
[338:51.71]Uh, I would, yes.
[338:54.22]I would consider... I would consider you to be chaotic evil.
[339:09.93]I'm just kidding.
[339:10.97]Neutral.
[339:11.65]Chaotic.
[339:12.49]You... Garfield doesn't get to be an RPG character.
[339:18.83]Okay?
[339:18.97]Okay.
[339:21.14]They never did an episode or a panel strip where he was playing Dungeons & Dragons.
[339:29.11]The pacing of that read.
[339:32.49]Yeah, I know.
[339:34.49]I know.
[339:38.75]What was Garfield's first bit message?
[339:40.39]That's a great question.
[339:43.71]Thank you, Jinzebo, for the $4.
[339:45.08]Joel...
[339:52.18]Jiltomenten is fat?
[339:57.34]Jiltom is fat.
[340:01.07]What?
[340:02.49]Are you spelling a word backwards or upside down or something?
[340:04.55]What are you doing?
[340:08.03]Thanks for the $4.
[340:08.59]Thank you, Ilmsalve, for the $2.
[340:10.65]Game is too hard for streamer.
[340:12.05]That's not true.
[340:12.63]I beat it.
[340:14.77]I beat it with all at least C-minuses.
[340:20.26]I'm not... That's not too shabby.
[340:24.42]Metal Sox gave the 50 bucks earlier.
[340:28.52]Thank you for $50.
[340:34.23]It's a lot of money.
[340:34.97]And by the way, before, if anyone caught the stream a little later, make sure that you go to the Discord and you check out the Secret Santa suggestions.
[340:47.67]You gotta get a suggestion in there over the next, like, 16 to 20-ish hours.
[340:53.47]Because I really have to get those packages ordered for Christmas Eve.
[340:57.87]So, let's go over it one more time, just like a TLD... TLDL, too long didn't listen.
[341:05.25]Uh...
[341:08.21]Christmas Eve, I'm doing a stream where I'm giving chat a $500 allowance to buy, pretty much I'll give suggestions for whatever they want me to buy.
[341:21.90]I'm going to have somebody else buy it and wrap it for me so I don't see it.
[341:25.18]And I'm going to open chat Christmas presents on Christmas Eve.
[341:31.06]The very, very short version of the long story there.
[341:34.59]So it has to be an Amazon link.
[341:36.84]That channel is not to, you know, chat in or anything.
[341:39.34]It needs to be an Amazon link and it has to be prime-able.
[341:42.36]It has to be prime shipping.
[341:46.28]Otherwise it just will not get here.
[341:48.08]The mods are gonna pick out.
[341:50.26]They're gonna be funneling them through.
[341:51.88]They're gonna be seeing them.
[341:52.64]They're gonna be taking ones that they think are interesting or fun or funny.
[341:56.18]There's no voting.
[341:57.14]It's not like a contest.
[341:58.44]It's just... And obviously if a bunch of people say the same thing, that's gonna have weight to it, right?
[342:08.93]There are... there are channel pins.
[342:14.97]Please go to Secret Santa Suggestions if you're interested and read the pinned message because it's a little bit to look at.
[342:22.21]It's got to be up to $50, no more than $50 suggestion.
[342:25.83]You can only suggest three things per person and there's no guarantee that the thing that you suggest is going to be picked.
[342:32.25]But we're going to have a bunch of random shit to open.
[342:35.11]I remember we talked about this a few weeks ago.
[342:37.51]Oh, wouldn't that be funny if chat and the mods kind of just bought a bunch of stuff on Amazon and I opened it?
[342:44.76]This is kind of part of that.
[342:47.34]So should be a lot of fun.
[342:49.22]I have no idea what they're going to be.
[342:50.18]I'm going to make sure I don't see it.
[342:51.14]Kim's going to wrap them and Kim's going to buy them.
[342:55.26]So I'm going to buy them on my Amazon, but Kim's going to do it.
[343:01.55]So I'm not gonna know what they are.
[343:04.47]This is a really bad idea.
[343:05.87]It could be!
[343:07.43]If there wasn't rules.
[343:09.31]No live animals.
[343:10.89]No bugs.
[343:12.40]No perishable food.
[343:14.46]No shit.
[343:15.46]No bad stuff.
[343:17.36]There are rules.
[343:18.00]You gotta read them.
[343:26.48]Oh, what do you mean?
[343:27.04]Oh, come on!
[343:35.40]Oh, come on.
[343:37.46]What about a $50 Amazon gift card?
[343:39.57]No, no, it's got to be an actual some kind of item.
[343:44.81]We'll see how, uh, how you guys come up with some stuff.
[343:48.25]Should be funny.
[343:52.34]Wait, what do you mean?
[343:53.06]I can't have you buy piss?
[343:55.14]Can you, you can buy pee on Amazon?
[344:02.41]The number one reason why there are these rules in place is number one, because they have to be shipped here in less than four days.
[344:10.10]And number two, I'm going to be doing it in the studio.
[344:13.76]So, the mods already joked about this before.
[344:17.88]Oh, 10,000 ladybugs.
[344:19.56]It's like, if I open that in this studio, oh boy, am I going to be in a lot of fucking trouble.
[344:25.26]Like, oh, yeah, sorry, in the studio that I was renting out.
[344:28.86]Oh, I put 10,000 bugs in your studio.
[344:32.12]Oh, no, no, no.
[344:33.34]Nope.
[344:34.14]No.
[344:37.84]This is like, I'm not, it's the same place that I did the green screen stream.
[344:42.23]So I'm going there again.
[344:43.77]It's going to be a whole ordeal.
[344:46.65]Stop calling it a studio.
[344:49.97]You mean the TV and film studio that I'm doing this in?
[344:53.75]What are you talking about?
[345:00.81]Yeah, it's a studio.
[345:03.14]It's where I filmed the green screen.
[345:04.50]Like how you call your room an office.
[345:10.23]Alright, whatever.
[345:15.61]Whatever.
[345:20.94]What do you want for Christmas?
[345:22.80]Well... Let me tell you.
[345:25.72]I would like... If you guys could possibly... And I mean this for real.
[345:30.72]I actually mean this for real.
[345:32.04]It's not a joke.
[345:32.80]I'm not kidding around.
[345:34.94]I want... I want some saltwater taffy.
[345:39.16]I'm serious.
[345:40.32]That's the number one thing that I want for Christmas.
[345:43.04]So, you know, I'll give you a little hint there.
[345:44.88]I'd really like some saltwater taffy.
[345:46.64]Some good saltwater taffy.
[345:52.06]You said no food.
[345:54.24]Taffy is not perishable.
[345:56.74]No, I'm talking about, like, sending me sandwiches or making me buy, like, fucking deli meat or something.
[346:03.35]No.
[346:04.73]Candy is not perishable.
[346:10.15]Can't do it.
[346:10.69]No food.
[346:11.47]No.
[346:12.69]Candy is not food.
[346:24.75]It's your rules, but that's what I want for Christmas so bad Get it yourself
[346:51.15]Anyways, it should be a lot of fun.
[346:52.85]I'm looking forward to the things you guys come up with.
[346:54.97]And me opening them without knowing what they are.
[346:58.09]And I'm sure there'll be some interesting things.
[347:02.00]Do I like licorice?
[347:03.12]I do not like licorice.
[347:05.02]I do not like it.
[347:06.36]No, sir, I don't like it.
[347:11.38]Anyways, let's move on here.
[347:14.56]Let's go to the spaz.
[347:16.32]Thanks for the $1.
[347:16.66]Gamer time.
[347:19.35]it was it was a pretty good gamer time tonight I think extra cheesy thanks to the one dollar five hundred dollars worth of garden gnomes incoming no and another thing the mods obviously are not going to pick out a bunch of repeats so if if you guys want to if you guys want to try to suggest oh no no everybody just suggest I'm not going to even say anything but like 60 of the same item to make it like 150 it's not gonna happen we got to have some variety you know what I mean
[347:55.78]I just want candy.
[348:03.58]Let's get him Smash Bros.
[348:05.10]Ultimate so he can play it on stream.
[348:06.90]I already own Smash Bros.
[348:08.34]Ultimate.
[348:08.68]Do not do that.
[348:15.21]I swear to God, if Smash Bros.
[348:17.03]Ultimate is there... I'm going to...
[348:23.83]I'm going to immediately donate it.
[348:25.77]So somebody else can enjoy Smash Bros.
[348:42.09]You don't like Smash Bros.?
[348:43.11]No, no, I already own it.
[348:44.39]But anywho.
[348:51.77]Thank you to...
[348:55.11]Uh, KXZ, we got you already, but thank you for the $30.
[348:58.71]We did do an EU-friendly stream today.
[349:03.03]I was up very, very early, and I knew I wasn't gonna be awake.
[349:06.53]I'm gonna be probably falling asleep here in the next three or four hours.
[349:10.11]Just because I was up so early, around, like, four o'clock in the morning.
[349:13.17]So, I got up early, and I'm gonna be passing out here soon.
[349:18.38]But, thank you so much for the $30.
[349:19.74]Cool.
[349:20.04]Oh, I almost just choked.
[349:22.50]Glad that, um...
[349:24.71]Some of the EU crowd can get a reasonable time today.
[349:29.43]No.
[349:29.65]I would love to.
[349:35.37]But it's just not something that I've had the time or really the resources to do.
[349:43.06]Because that's a big commitment, it is.
[349:45.64]That's a long way away.
[349:46.94]You gotta- you can't just go to Europe for like two days.
[349:49.77]Oh, yeah, we spend a weekend in London!
[349:53.43]No, that's not gonna happen.
[349:54.23]You gotta be there for at least a week or two.
[349:59.47]But it is a large amount of travel, large commitment.
[350:07.89]London in Europe.
[350:09.03]Oh, well, you know what I mean though.
[350:12.52]London.
[350:13.80]Coming to the EU.
[350:15.06]I know.
[350:16.08]You know what I'm talking about.
[350:21.32]But happy 30th birthday to you, KXE, as well.
[350:24.60]You're still here.
[350:27.29]Hey, TheLongEgg, thanks for the $1.
[350:29.21]Why do you get your blood removed often?
[350:31.35]Are you okay?
[350:36.35]I have been...
[350:39.51]Struggling with an annoying thing for about six months.
[350:43.90]I don't know what it is.
[350:46.04]And I'm not going to just like, oh, hey, this is the problem.
[350:48.86]I don't know.
[350:50.22]All I know, like I've told you guys over the last three or four streams, I've been trying to eat a different diet.
[350:58.02]I've been trying to stay away from gluten to see if that helps.
[351:01.24]But I've been having some weird stomach and back and chest pain for about six months.
[351:08.12]That's why I've kind of been at the doctor a lot to try to figure out what the fuck is going on with my body and why it's doing this and There's been You know Stay healthy.
[351:22.41]No, I'm fine.
[351:23.55]Don't worry about me but If you're wondering why I'm going to the doctor.
[351:28.00]Well, I can't stream tomorrow.
[351:28.94]I gotta I gotta go to the doctor.
[351:30.00]I
[351:37.01]I need to eat flintstones.
[351:43.28]But, uh, it's potentially something as simple as too much bad bacteria.
[351:51.72]And that would be really, really great if it was, because that's very easy to fix.
[351:59.93]But I've had some really just strange medical happenings that really has nothing to do with my intestines.
[352:10.85]But, quick, send him taffy.
[352:15.17]See?
[352:17.69]I would feel so much better if I had some taffy.
[352:24.29]No, all jokes aside, I'll figure it out.
[352:28.65]Don't worry about me, I'm fine.
[352:31.67]But I am, I did, I have been at the doctor a few times.
[352:36.48]Don't worry about me, I'm gonna be just fucking fine.
[352:41.47]Eat fish and garlic and have spinach and vegetables and make sure you eat them.
[352:46.50]Hey, Cloud, thanks for the $1.
[352:47.62]Thanks for streaming.
[352:48.22]Thanks for watching.
[352:50.78]Really, thank you.
[352:53.42]The Faux Jacko, thanks for the $1.
[352:57.91]Hashtag charity.
[353:00.71]Thank you for that.
[353:04.67]The Slimey Squash, thanks for $5, Slimey Squash.
[353:08.46]Hey Jeremiah, I've been watching your videos since the beginning and you've always had the ability to help with my depression and make me feel better without fail.
[353:14.10]I'm at the lowest point in my life so far and I want to hear what advice you might have.
[353:20.41]Love you and I'm glad you've never stopped making me laugh.
[353:25.81]It's the same advice that I say kind of often, right?
[353:30.95]And that's sometimes you might feel pretty fucking low right now, right?
[353:42.18]But you got to take each day at a time slow.
[353:48.94]It doesn't happen overnight.
[353:50.13]It takes a while.
[353:52.07]But as long as every day or every, you know, once a week, once every few days, you're really trying to either better yourself or try to figure out why.
[354:02.29]It's not easy.
[354:12.87]And I always feel... I always feel for people that, you know, say this kind of shit because, you know, I've been there.
[354:23.24]You guys have heard the stories before.
[354:24.62]I've felt like fucking shit before.
[354:28.56]You know, 10 years ago or so.
[354:33.45]You just gotta try, you know?
[354:54.45]You're so sweet, Jerbo.
[354:56.69]No, I mean, but I want also to, you know, have people realize that there isn't just a simple, oh, this is how you fix it.
[355:05.00]That's it.
[355:05.66]It's all wrapped up.
[355:06.50]That's how you fix it.
[355:08.41]Because everybody's so different.
[355:09.73]Everybody has such different, wildly different personalities, viewpoints, beliefs, things that they like, things that they don't like.
[355:17.71]It's hard.
[355:18.25]So many problems, right?
[355:20.93]Different problems.
[355:23.13]There's a lot of different points you can come from.
[355:25.79]So it's very, very difficult.
[355:27.07]Because there's so many ways.
[355:42.54]Takes time to get over it.
[355:43.40]It does.
[355:47.22]But I really do wish you the best.
[355:49.73]Hopefully you get it all figured out.
[356:01.17]Much love to you.
[356:04.26]Somebody said therapy helps.
[356:07.63]Yeah.
[356:08.91]If it's something that you think would help, you could get out there, start talking to somebody.
[356:12.95]Because you never really want to have it just kind of sit there.
[356:22.60]And just wallow inside over and over and over again.
[356:26.74]It's not healthy, you know?
[356:30.81]It really is better to at least have somebody that either knows or is a professional.
[356:39.83]And I'm not a professional at all.
[356:41.27]That's another thing I guess we need to address is I can only tell you the things that have helped me or the things that I think are a good idea.
[356:51.02]But at the end of the day, I'm not really equipped for it.
[356:57.87]But, um... I really do wish you the best.
[357:00.27]Hopefully you figure it out soon.
[357:03.01]Takes time.
[357:06.67]I am a professional streamer.
[357:08.26]Well, I'm not a professional therapist or a psychiatrist, so... There is that.
[357:17.10]Not a professional gamer.
[357:20.44]I've never... When did I... Where in my resume has it said, or financial advisor?
[357:24.03]I said that too!
[357:27.49]I'm not a professional gamer.
[357:28.53]I'm not a professional financial advisor.
[357:30.05]I'm not a professional... Um... When am I a professional at?
[357:34.96]Skiing.
[357:35.72]You guys don't even know.
[357:36.90]Okay.
[357:37.50]Well... I... Oh, lids off that one!
[357:44.15]I won the silver medal.
[357:47.13]In the 2000... In the 2000... In the 1999... Uh... In the 2004 Olympic Games.
[357:49.31]Silver medal.
[357:58.98]And, I mean... Lid's off that now, I can't... Oh no, what the fuck?
[358:04.84]I can't believe it!
[358:07.74]Not gold?
[358:08.84]Oh yeah.
[358:11.55]Nobody... You know, you don't want to get on the Wheaties box.
[358:13.75]That's like the Madden curse.
[358:21.43]You want the silver medal.
[358:23.93]Shines more.
[358:29.42]2004 was summer.
[358:30.78]Yeah, I mean, you're part of the continent.
[358:33.04]You're part of the world.
[358:35.58]Guys, I'm sorry, maybe if you don't know this, when it's summer on one part of the world, it's winter on the other.
[358:46.57]We live in different hemispheres.
[358:47.89]So, 2004, it was summer, but it was winter on the other side of the planet.
[358:56.10]And I did my competition on location.
[358:57.92]Because they wanted to make sure that they had... They wanted to make sure they got that competition in.
[359:06.70]The Olympics.
[359:08.59]The Winter Olympics... When did... What do you mean, Olympics?
[359:13.07]I was talking about... The, like, the junior high school... Kids... Um... Like, junior varsity league.
[359:24.74]When did I say Olympics?
[359:31.58]What the hell are you talking about?
[359:36.74]We were on a very difficult bunny hill.
[359:42.39]I fell like probably four or five times.
[359:43.91]And it wasn't fair because it was this really, really, really huge, huge dude that was in my class.
[359:52.08]And he just went straight and put all his weight down and it wasn't fair.
[360:07.86]Alzheimer's settling in.

[360:36.44]Merry early Christmas.
[360:37.42]Hope you have a good Christmas and open up some goodies.
[360:40.12]I really appreciate you, and I know it's stupid, but I want to be like you.
[360:43.99]You're sort of my idol.
[360:45.61]Anyways, whatever.
[360:46.45]See you next stream.
[360:52.33]You want to be like me?
[360:55.86]I want you to be you.
[360:57.92]I want you to be like you.
[361:00.90]You know?
[361:11.29]But I am you.
[361:18.88]Everybody's got something.
[361:21.82]Trust me, everybody's got something.
[361:27.86]You are just a vessel.
[361:35.52]No, that's not... Not herpes.
[361:39.78]Oh my god.
[361:42.36]Thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[361:44.85]But... Always remember... If I'm your idol... I mean, I'm... I can't even imagine somebody saying that.
[361:58.27]It's... Thank you.
[362:00.01]That's... I don't... I don't know why.
[362:02.13]I mean, I guess that... Thanks...
[362:07.37]Being somebody's idol.
[362:08.15]You know what I mean?
[362:12.69]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[362:15.29]No.
[362:17.13]I mean, look, when somebody says something like that, it's... You know, it makes you think.
[362:20.63]It makes you think that... You know, I want to... If I have that much of an impact on somebody, then I want to make sure that... It's, like, good, and it makes them feel good, and makes them feel happy, and...
[362:38.10]I don't ever want to have, like, a negative impact on somebody's life.
[362:41.46]It's just... I don't want to do that.
[362:48.78]Really makes you think.
[362:53.21]But I am honored and absolutely floored that somebody sees me as their idol.
[362:59.21]Thank you.
[363:01.54]We had a bunch of community subs.

[363:05.95]Lorag.
[363:07.65]Lorag gave 10 community subs.
[363:09.43]I missed it somehow.
[363:11.33]I think I was just entrenched in the video game.

[363:33.80]Every month I collect soda cans and beer bottles and collect any spare change I can find so I can go eat at the buffet at the Golden Corral.
[363:41.45]When I went yesterday with some other Bias, I got a pile of fried chicken.
[363:44.91]But when I went to go for the smiley face fries, I couldn't find any.
[363:50.42]Voice.
[363:51.10]Voice.
[363:52.10]Wait, they have smiley face fries at Golden Corral?
[363:59.08]How does that work?
[364:03.11]I love those fries.
[364:06.76]So this is a part two from Siroc here.
[364:10.46]So I asked one of the waitresses where smiley face fries were.
[364:13.84]She said they stopped serving them after we ate thrice the daily calories required for a normal beer.
[364:20.64]Me and the other beers left and started throwing trash at the front door until they threatened to call the police on us.
[364:28.92]We got out of there right out of there very quickly.
[364:34.35]That's part two.
[364:35.07]Thank you for the $5, Siroc.
[364:37.10]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.

[364:39.98]I feel like I've completely missed the Smash train there.
[364:45.11]And I'm not very good.
[364:48.03]I got really knocked down a few pegs.
[364:51.97]I was like, I'm very ready for online!
[364:54.01]And I went to online and just got destroyed.
[364:56.15]It was embarrassing.
[364:59.21]So, I don't think it would be a really good stream.
[365:01.43]It would just be me losing.
[365:12.52]Online is getting fixed.
[365:13.48]And yeah, online was having a lot of problems before, so that's why I kind of stayed away from it.
[365:22.08]Mario Tennis all over again.
[365:23.37]No, I don't get angry at Smash.
[365:27.43]I don't get angry at Smash because Smash is... People are really, really good at that game.
[365:34.29]And in Mario Tennis, you just play as fucking Rosalina and Luma and you get the super spin and it's like, what even is that?
[365:46.06]I just got angry.
[365:46.84]Okay, I'm gonna slow down.
[365:54.35]Okay, I'm feeling alright.
[366:00.01]It should be a really just interesting time.
[366:01.71]It'll be fun.
[366:02.05]It's going to be fun just to open these presents alone, and regardless of how long it takes me to build the motorized train set.
[366:06.18]And yes, that is a spoiler.
[366:28.24]Depends on how long that takes to make.
[366:39.57]But anyways, thank you.

[369:59.83]I'm such a boomer.
[370:00.81]What?

[370:02.21]I don't know what that is.
[370:08.42]I don't like scour the internet for all the references.
[370:21.32]I'm way too young to be a boomer.
[370:22.76]I know and that's why I don't get it.
[370:26.88]I was born in 1991.
[370:28.84]So how could I be a boomer?
[370:40.93]This is a song that has 1.5 billion views.
[370:46.31]I mean, if you have a YouTube channel that gets to a point where you have more views than people on Earth... I don't even... That's like God's status.
[370:58.48]If you have, like, 10 billion views on your YouTube channel... More people have... More people have seen you... There's only, like, 20 people on Earth.
[371:19.85]1.5 billion people on Earth?
[371:20.79]No, I'm saying that there are channels that have, like, what, 7, 8, 9, 10 billion views?
[371:32.30]Why would I read that?
[371:33.32]What did I do?
[371:40.14]My point is, if you've been viewed more times than there are humans on Earth, if you have a YouTube channel that has that many views... That's really popular.
[371:52.63]You guys are confusing me now.
[371:56.15]They are.
[371:58.49]I'm from the alternate Earth.

[376:07.08]Uh, I can't.
[376:08.52]I'm sorry.
[376:10.68]Just every time you feel me yawning, I told you.
[376:13.58]Fucking, they took too much blood.
[376:17.66]So, let me ask you guys if you like this, because I'm like this.
[376:23.09]When I go to the doctor and I get my blood taken and you sit there, I've, by the way, I've never seen ever, I've never seen a needle go into my arm.
[376:37.38]I've never looked at it.
[376:39.36]I don't know what it looks like.
[376:40.92]I have no idea what the mechanism is.
[376:43.36]I just know that it hurts for a second and that's it.
[376:45.52]And I don't look.
[376:49.55]It changes.
[376:50.29]Oh, yep.
[376:51.81]I don't ever want to know.
[376:53.79]So what I do is I do this little technique that right when the needle's about to go in for either a shot or for blood work, I will take my index finger and I'll put it on my, let's say I'm getting blood drawn from my left arm.
[377:07.91]I'll put my index finger down on my right knee, and I'll just give a little scratch on my right knee, not hard or anything, because it tricks your brain.
[377:19.05]Once it goes, you know, okay, they say, here comes the pinch, I just start scratching, and then your brain doesn't know where to feel the sensation.
[377:27.44]So it kind of messes with your brain.
[377:30.35]Anyways, after the first, because I had to get like seven vials taken out of me, and I saw that, and I was like, oh, okay, I'll be alright.
[377:38.65]After one vial, you kind of just sit in there and you say, okay, everything's fine.
[377:43.75]That's the one vial.
[377:45.05]I usually only have like one or two vials taken.
[377:49.51]After the third vial, I could really start to feel like they were draining my life force.
[377:56.16]Vial number four and five, I could just... You know when you're getting blood taken, and you just talk to, like, the nurse or the nurse practitioner?
[378:04.47]And you hate every second of it?
[378:06.99]So, uh, how you doing?
[378:08.43]You just moved here?
[378:09.49]Yeah, yeah, I just moved here.
[378:11.37]It's a great place.
[378:13.81]Oh, cool.
[378:14.93]So, what are you into?
[378:16.29]I like hamburgers.
[378:18.97]Please, leave me alone.
[378:19.84]Leave me the fuck alone.
[378:21.88]You just don't want to talk?
[378:22.48]You just... I hate that.
[378:24.41]Because I always feel like I have to put on like a show because I'm like panicking internally.
[378:29.36]And I'm trying as hard as I can to focus on trying not to panic internally.
[378:33.31]And now I have to tell you what my favorite food is.
[378:40.77]And at like vial number six and seven, I don't like, I don't care about needles.
[378:45.64]They don't scare me.
[378:46.60]I'm not scared of having my blood taken or having a shot or anything.
[378:50.76]But you kind of psych yourself up after you've been sitting there for about five minutes.
[378:55.96]And I've never given blood before.
[379:00.03]I, they take like at least I think two or three times what I had taken out of me yesterday.
[379:07.65]And at that seventh file, I remember like the world was kind of starting to close in.
[379:12.88]And it wasn't because I was scared of the needle.
[379:16.26]It was because I think they were just taking all my blood.
[379:21.27]You know?
[379:27.39]I'm sitting there like, they're taking too much, I think.
[379:30.75]Here we go.
[379:31.37]I'm starting to feel it.
[379:32.51]I'm going out.
[379:33.97]No, no, everything's fine.
[379:34.83]Everything's fine.
[379:35.27]Hey, so where did you move here?
[379:36.71]Yeah, I moved here from Massachusetts.
[379:40.19]Hey, you good, man?

[379:54.34]Absolutely not.
[379:56.86]You sure?
[379:57.38]Yeah, man, I'm cool.
[379:59.34]And you're using every ounce of your fucking energy and body to walk like a human to where you have to go sit down because you think the world's closing in.
[380:10.89]You're like an alien in human skin pretending to walk.
[380:13.95]Stop saying yeah when you mean no.
[380:21.17]I don't know why I do that.
[380:22.34]I feel like a lot of other people do that too.
[380:32.40]You said this exact sentence during your Demon's Souls stream?
[380:35.25]It's relevant!
[380:40.03]Just eat him.
[380:40.55]Yeah, and that's another thing.
[380:41.67]You're supposed to eat?
[380:43.41]Oh, have you eaten today?
[380:45.25]And then I think about it, and... Yeah!
[380:49.28]But what does that mean?
[380:50.26]Does that mean, oh, I like ate a piece of a carrot?
[380:54.08]No, no, that's... Come on, man!
[380:56.78]No, you have to eat like a full meal!
[381:01.34]All the material.
[381:04.34]So have you eaten at all today?
[381:05.28]This is a literal question.
[381:06.82]Yes, I had.
[381:07.60]I crunched a carrot once.
[381:13.47]I had Captain Crunch in my underwear.
[381:18.82]Why are you like this?
[381:19.72]I don't know.
[381:32.70]I ate ass today.
[381:34.34]Can you imagine the doctor's face?
[381:43.40]So, um, yeah, you're about to have your blood work done.
[381:45.42]Have you had anything to eat today?
[381:47.26]Yeah.
[381:48.30]I ate ass today.
[381:53.48]I feel like the doctor would laugh.
[381:58.69]If I was a doctor, I would be like, holy shit, this guy's fucking crazy, and I would laugh.
[382:05.48]high five but long story short that was the first time in I don't maybe ever that I've ever had that much taken from a doctor in one in one go what a great story tell it again on your demon soul stream

[385:15.88]Aye, aye, aye.
[385:17.48]Beater.
[385:20.68]That doesn't count because it was after the stream.
[385:26.86]What is the correct one?
[385:27.93]We're talking about Joe Swanson from Family Guy.
[385:31.23]Beater.
[385:33.19]Beater.
[385:33.71]Beater.
[385:34.75]Let me tell you something.
[385:35.79]Beater.
[385:36.45]Beater.
[385:38.05]That's not Guy from Office Space or Willem Dafoe saying, Peter, don't tell Harry, Peter.
[385:43.06]Peter.

[387:06.16]Would you say TF2 is dead now?
[387:08.08]Hashtag charity.
[387:10.00]No.
[387:10.58]I don't think so.
[387:13.36]It's really hard for that game to be dead.
[387:15.48]It's not... That's a free FPS that's on Steam that everybody knows is a really good game.
[387:22.99]So... It's... That game can really never go away forever.
[387:30.07]I mean, is it probably... Is it a little... Are the numbers probably less than what they were five years ago?
[387:36.65]I would... Probably.
[387:40.29]But it doesn't cost anything, and it's one of the best FPS... It's one of the best games I think I've ever played, so... A game like that, it's like... It doesn't go away.
[387:58.70]There's just constant influx of new players that have never played it before.
[388:01.90]And it's like, holy shit.
[388:04.56]Imagine going back and removing from your brain ever knowing what Team Fortress 2 was.
[388:11.49]You would open that up and it's just, wow, look at all this stuff to do.
[388:17.91]There's a lot of things to do.
[388:23.45]But no, it's a great game.
[388:24.97]It'll probably be around for a long time.
[388:28.64]Uh, thank you, Havegun, for the $1.
[388:31.82]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say that your streams and the second Jerma vids have helped me stay mentally strong in law school.
[388:37.90]The green screen stream caused the stress of impeding finals to melt away under unending laughter.
[388:43.65]Looking forward to the Christmas Eve stream.
[388:49.31]The green screen stuff was absolutely fucking phenomenal.
[388:53.47]I was so happy with how that turned out.
[388:57.50]I'm happy that you can hang out here and keep yourself, you know, grounded and find some relaxation.
[389:09.93]Thank you for being here.
[389:11.68]And hopefully we see you again real soon.
[389:17.42]And good luck in law school.
[389:24.62]That's a lot of work.
[389:25.31]Good luck.

[390:13.16]Besides, I'm fucking happy that you think it is good.
[390:20.25]In a world where there are so many people to watch...
[390:26.05]I'm humbled and sometimes surprised that a lot of you guys choose to watch me, so.
[390:33.33]Why would I take that for granted, right?
[390:34.81]I want to try as fucking my damnedest to keep going, so.
[390:43.06]Mostly lost thanks to the $1.

[390:58.64]Mostly lost thanks to the $1.
[391:00.16]For your information, this is the video they kept referencing in the Garfield level.
[391:04.92]They kept referencing a video?
[391:06.34]Whoa.
[391:15.96]I thought I'd have a good meal.
[391:18.06]Garfield, you fat cat.
[391:20.48]You are so big and fat.
[391:22.42]Why are you so fat?
[391:24.66]I eat, John.
[391:25.99]It's what I do.
[391:27.64]It's time to get Odie off the table.
[391:30.38]Don't do it, Garfield.
[391:32.76]That's our pet dog, Odie.
[391:35.12]You're going into orbit, you stupid mutt.
[391:39.27]Garfield, I'm a cat who loves to snooze.
[391:47.75]I can't handle it.
[391:49.21]I can't handle that.
[391:50.32]Here's the video.
[391:54.26]What's with the void the voice cuts it's cutting itself off over and over again Let's get some
[392:12.66]Where are the three cheezy sons?
[392:15.40]I ate this food.
[392:17.17]Where are the taco shells?
[392:18.87]I ate this food.
[392:20.55]Where did all the hamburger helper go?
[392:26.11]You're such a bad kitty.
[392:28.07]That's it.
[392:28.85]I had it with you.
[392:29.95]That does it.
[392:30.96]I'm done.
[392:31.58]That's the last straw, Ruffalo.
[392:36.84]Stuffed in your face as usual.
[392:41.19]What a weird video.
[392:42.71]That was a ride.
[392:45.92]But now it makes sense.
[392:47.58]Thank you, MostlyLost.

[392:56.61]No message.
[392:57.09]Just adding charity there.
[392:59.11]Thank you.
[393:00.98]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[393:01.90]During the Garfield mod, you kept skipping words.
[393:04.02]At first, I thought it was because they were swears, but it became clear that you were skipping them because they were too big.
[393:08.88]Hashtag charity.
[393:11.56]That's not what happened.
[393:12.78]I was just tired.
[393:13.65]I'm just tired.
[393:15.05]And I was just skipping over dialog.
[393:18.27]You have to, like, bump my arm a little while I'm lying down.
[393:21.56]Because I have the book in my hands, and all of my children are around me, and it's like... I'm reading, reading, reading, reading, reading, reading... Eyes closed.
[393:32.06]Little nudge.
[393:32.74]And then that's when the prince decided that the castle was a little too high for him to go.
[393:38.38]So the prince decided to nudge.
[393:40.90]And the prince decided... That's what happened when I was a kid.
[393:55.08]When my mother used to read stories, she would fall asleep in the middle of reading them.
[393:59.81]And we wanted to hear the rest of the story, so me and my brother would just give her a little, like... Just move enough a little bit so she felt the movement, and then she would just start reading again from where she left off.
[394:20.93]It was very, very funny.
[394:30.49]But thank you, Smellyboy.
[394:32.15]Thank you, Cloudy, for the $2.
[394:33.42]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say thanks for the streams.
[394:35.52]Also, thank you for playing Garfield.
[394:37.34]I love that fat orange cat.
[394:40.32]Most people do.
[394:43.61]Not me, though.
[394:46.07]I do, but... No, I do.
[394:48.94]Thank you, uh, Kyralo, for the one dollar.
[394:51.22]One day, they wake up in the smell of pancakes cooking.
[394:54.09]The first mole sticks his head out of the hole and says, I smell pancakes.
[394:57.69]The second mole sticks his head out of the hole and says, I smell syrup.
[395:01.13]The... The last mole tries to stick his head out of the hole, but it gets stuck behind the other two, so he said, all I smell is molasses.
[395:24.87]What joke book did you get that out of?
[395:27.31]That is a joke book.
[395:28.61]That's a dirty joke book.
[395:32.39]Paragraph.
[395:35.69]Your local novelty gift shop.
[395:37.10]You know the one with the guy that has like... It's a weird caricature of a guy's face and his ass is towards the camera on the front cover of the book.
[395:44.98]And just like a huge fart cloud is coming out of his ass.
[395:48.79]And he's like, he's holding his fucking nose and he's like looking, staring like, oh!
[395:52.71]And it's the dirty jokes!
[395:59.98]That's where that came from.
[396:05.44]That's not me making like a, making up something, that's real.
[396:08.60]That's a real product.
[396:10.18]That somebody sells.
[396:10.90]Or at least they used to.
[396:20.36]Thank you, Brandon, for the $1.
[396:22.68]You should play Lisa on stream.
[396:23.92]It's an amazing game.
[396:24.60]I think you'll like it.
[396:29.66]That's a perfect Christmas present.
[396:31.68]Don't tell me anything.
[396:33.26]I don't want to know what it is.
[396:34.32]I got you nothing.
[396:46.99]That's okay.
[396:47.97]You're here.
[396:50.56]You're here.
[396:51.60]Your presence is enough.
[396:54.50]Uh, Dragon Breath, thanks for the $1.
[396:55.92]Hey, Jerma, there's a good, chill stream game you should try called Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[397:00.90]You use a mop and bucket to clean up a horrific workplace.
[397:04.02]Yeah, me and, uh, Etalyx actually played it a long time ago.
[397:06.64]Was there ever a video of Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[397:13.24]I swear to God, I have this vivid memory of a Viscera Cleanup Detail video.
[397:21.57]I don't know.
[397:22.39]I know that I recorded it or was recorded playing it.
[397:29.16]I know maybe Etalyx has a video of it where we played together.
[397:35.42]There's a Christmas level as well.
[397:37.02]Hashtag charity.
[397:40.44]Could make a good stream.
[397:42.76]They've probably added a lot of content.
[397:45.12]So it might be worth another look.
[397:50.79]here we go here's here's the video alright can you explain I have no idea what's going on so can you please explain it because I have absolutely no idea what's happening here alright we are space janitors yeah it's just a random generic first person shooter like corridor level yeah this is I remember this funny moments funny gamer moments
[398:17.47]That's an old Jerma voice?
[398:19.39]That's an old Jerma microphone.
[398:20.99]My voice hasn't changed.
[398:24.18]Young Jerma?
[398:33.18]Uh, thank you Graveyard Ghoul for the one dollar.
[398:34.84]You mentioned a long time ago about doing a Smash stream.
[398:37.54]I think you said you wanted to do World of Light, but I'm guessing now you've beaten it.
[398:41.98]So if you have, does that mean we could have mods versus Jerma tournament?
[398:47.23]If you were here earlier when I talked about Smash, I am painfully bad at it.
[398:53.25]I get so just slam dunked on every single game that it's probably not something I'm going to stream.
[398:59.67]I went through World of Light.
[399:00.99]I went through about 60% of it.
[399:05.47]So I still have about 30 or 40% of the map still to do.
[399:13.59]That's what makes a good stream.
[399:17.35]Yeah, but I mean, is it funny for the first, like, hour?
[399:21.13]And then it's just like, okay.
[399:23.62]This dude just can't win any games.
[399:26.78]And me going like, fuck!
[399:28.88]Fuck!
[399:29.94]Well, that was today.
[399:31.94]Was today a good stream?
[399:35.48]Was that a good stream today?
[399:36.68]Because that's exactly what I'm describing.
[399:49.22]Especially the Garth mission.
[399:53.00]It'd be fun to watch.
[399:56.16]Maybe I will do it.
[399:58.56]It would have to be probably after Christmas, though, because I've got too much going on.
[400:07.91]But thank you, Graveyard Ghoul.
[400:10.03]Hopefully that answers your question.
[400:12.63]Jerma502, thanks for the $1.
[400:15.69]Hey Jerma, it's me, your favorite clone.
[400:18.17]258 went missing recently.
[400:19.65]Have you seen him?
[400:20.83]I'm getting worried.
[400:21.49]Last I heard he was screaming something about Fortnite.
[400:24.31]Anyhow, I have continued our cover-up on the incident that happened last year.
[400:28.84]You know, the one involving the jolly red guy.
[400:31.42]People are catching on.
[400:32.30]Anyhow, I should continue my work.
[400:35.62]I'm almost done editing your first Fortnite compilation on the main channel.

[401:24.10]I already made my peace.
[401:25.88]You already heard what I have to say about it.
[401:27.20]Hey, thank you, uh... Dork!
[401:37.83]For the $10?
[401:41.37]First time donation.
[401:42.21]Been watching you since like 2012.
[401:42.99]I'm about to be deployed.
[401:50.00]Like the other people always say, you brought me joy when I felt like the world was metaphorically empty.
[401:55.42]You do you and I can't wait to see what you do when I come back.
[402:01.51]Good luck.
[402:02.85]Best of luck to you.
[402:09.09]Out of curiosity, are you US military?
[402:14.89]Overseas military?
[402:15.63]I know this was about 40 minutes ago or so.
[402:26.51]If you're still here.
[402:32.85]But regardless, take care of yourself.
[402:35.87]Good luck.
[402:39.56]And thank you so much for not only your service, but for being around for that long.
[402:50.21]Much love to you.
[402:51.27]Take care.
[403:05.54]We await your return.
[403:12.26]U.S.
[403:12.50]Army?
[403:17.27]Yeah, because sometimes when somebody, when people say that they're, oh, I'm going into training or I'm going to be deployed or I'm always curious as to if it's U.S.
[403:25.91]military or if it's a different like overseas military.
[403:29.22]I'm usually very curious.
[403:36.20]But thank you again for $10 as well.
[403:41.18]Cheese Nuggets, thanks for the $1.
[403:42.48]Thank you for your words of support and care towards people down in the luck that clamor to your stuff to cheer them up from time to time.
[403:51.01]You're definitely one of the sweetest, most genuine streamers.
[403:53.77]I'm afraid of 2019 due to feeling like I lost everything in the last month, but knowing things that work out in the end, etc., and your genuine words of empathy towards messages like this is a great small comfort.
[404:05.44]Thanks, Jeremy.
[404:05.98]We wish the best.
[404:07.00]We wish the best, too.
[404:09.00]And they say, Gay Pride, Pac-Man World 2 on Steam.
[404:13.08]When?
[404:15.62]That's a great question.
[404:19.03]Where is Pac-Man World 2?
[404:22.95]And why is it not been re-released and remastered?
[404:30.35]But no, I'll be real honest with you.
[404:35.93]Oh, it's thank you for your words of support and care towards people down in their luck and... I'm a person, too.
[404:44.48]You know what I mean?
[404:45.00]Like, I know what that's like.
[404:51.37]You know?
[404:56.41]You are?
[404:57.29]Nice try, alien.
[404:59.91]So when I see people having a rough fucking time, it...
[405:04.13]You know, it's... Empathy is... I don't... Nobody ever wants to watch somebody not have a good time.
[405:12.07]Be... Feel bad about themselves or their life, you know?
[405:15.80]I... It genuinely... It makes me feel fucking bad.
[405:26.93]So...
[405:32.34]Because I take a look at, you know, the things that have happened in my life and where I've gone and where I want to go and where I've been and... It's, um... We all, we're all doing this together.
[405:47.15]We're all doing it at the same time, you know?
[405:50.89]And I would feel terrible if I just kind of wrote this type of stuff off as like, ah, whatever.
[405:58.64]Oh, you're having, like, trouble and stuff?
[406:00.32]Oh, yeah, whatever, no way, you know what I mean?
[406:03.28]Of course I fucking care about it, because it's something that I'm happy that people can come here and enjoy themselves.
[406:17.29]Some people I know do like watching me suffer, so it's a comfort when you care.
[406:26.81]That just shouldn't be how it is.
[406:27.95]That just shouldn't be the way it is.
[406:29.47]And... I think it's just like a people thing, you know what I mean?
[406:49.65]I always feel terrible when somebody...
[406:52.98]Just doesn't feel like good enough doesn't feel fucking smart enough doesn't feel good enough doesn't feel liked or Don't worry about what other people think
[407:10.85]That's tough though, you know?
[407:12.53]Because I say the same thing, like, oh, just let things be, you know, if somebody wants to be like a dick about something, or if somebody wants to be like genuinely like, and we're not talking about like banter, right?
[407:24.62]We're talking about like genuinely feeling bad and being treated poorly.
[407:30.66]Nobody wants to feel like that.
[407:47.72]about it a lot because I've got into this position here where you know there are a lot of people that watch this stream and this channel has grown a lot and I do see from time to time people struggling people not having a good time
[408:17.65]I'm just glad you can have a good time here.
[408:23.55]And I don't want to broken record myself.
[408:26.43]But I do think about that.
[408:33.25]So thanks for being here.
[408:38.08]It's the same motorcycle every time.
[408:44.39]But like, somebody just keeps just driving down the road.
[408:47.91]It's the same person on the motorcycle every time.
[408:57.45]Is it at the same times too?
[409:08.97]I'm scared of motorcycles.
[409:10.23]Did I ever tell you guys that?
[409:13.72]Motorcycles to me are just a bicycle that go really fast.
[409:19.90]And I'm really sloppy on a bicycle.
[409:27.89]I think motorcycles are really cool.
[409:30.67]I think they're really, really awesome.
[409:33.33]I love driving around in motorcycles in video games.
[409:36.19]I know that's not real, but I think they're really, really fucking cool.
[409:40.47]But they've scared the shit out of me.
[409:47.54]Hey Cloudy, thanks for the two dollars.
[409:48.94]I don't want to brag, Jerma, but I'm also a very talented athlete.
[409:52.26]I came in third place in the 2010 fifth grade water balloon toss.
[409:56.25]So I'm kind of a big deal.
[409:57.83]Hashtag charity.
[410:00.53]No, that is, that's a pretty big fucking deal.
[410:03.97]You know how hard it is to hold those things and when they throw them really high and you have to grow, go all the way down to the ground and support it all the way down and it doesn't break?
[410:12.02]It takes talent.
[410:24.52]Another $50 came in from Duke.
[410:31.98]I think I said Dork last time.
[410:34.78]I added an R for some reason.
[410:35.90]$50.
[410:37.22]I say, screw it.
[410:39.39]You deserve it.
[410:39.95]Read my other donation if you see it.
[410:44.83]That's $50 from me.
[410:47.65]Thank you.
[410:52.59]Good luck.
[410:53.11]Take care of yourself.
[410:58.78]It's Duke, not dork.
[411:00.30]I know, I'm just like, I'm just stupid and added an R. As much as I skip words, sometimes I add them too.
[411:07.02]I don't know why.
[411:15.15]But, sincerely, sincerely much love to you.
[411:20.99]Hope we see you soon.
[411:22.71]You're here.
[411:24.03]Cheers to that, as I say sometimes.
[411:27.31]As we say, right?
[411:28.57]We say that.
[411:36.52]Does Jerma think that birds are real?
[411:39.36]Why would I not think birds are real?
[411:43.19]Yeah, it's ADHD.
[411:44.67]It is.
[411:48.76]He's tired and he got his blood stolen.
[411:50.64]Give him a break.
[411:51.30]I know!
[411:51.86]Uh, almost done with the bits here.
[411:56.62]Thank you.
[411:56.96]Bet three for the five dollars.
[411:58.18]I would give my blood to you if you needed a blood transfusion, Jerma.
[412:04.34]Thank- Well, thank you for that.
[412:10.31]Jerma's laughing my ass off.
[412:11.41]Jerma thinks birds are real.
[412:14.67]Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?
[412:17.63]No, because pigeons are robots.
[412:19.31]I can agree with you there.
[412:26.16]That is a government program.
[412:28.04]That is a government-run program where they are trying, they're testing out robotics.
[412:48.29]What's my blood type?
[412:49.09]I don't know.
[412:51.90]I actually really don't know what it is, and I always tell myself that next time I get blood, next time I get blood taken, next time I get blood taken, I'm gonna ask.
[412:58.68]I always forget.
[413:05.72]And then Duke again with ten more dollars.
[413:11.35]Fun fact, did you know Jerma is actually Spider-Man?
[413:15.99]Maybe a few years ago, when I was a little more physically fit, could I have passed as Spider-Man.
[413:26.69]I could be like the Spider-Man with the hanging gut.
[413:30.89]Because I got one of those.
[413:33.01]And I never thought that was going to happen.
[413:36.61]It's getting older, guys.
[413:38.11]Listen to me.
[413:39.85]I looked in the mirror six or seven years ago and was just like flexing and standing to the side and puffing out my fucking quads.
[413:49.06]And just, there's no way that that person's gonna have like a fucking bloated stomach.
[413:54.36]It's never gonna happen.
[413:55.46]I was convinced.
[413:57.56]I don't know how it happens.
[413:58.76]It just does.
[414:03.57]I look in the mirror now.
[414:04.31]I still look alright.
[414:05.51]I still look pretty good.
[414:07.71]But where did this like weird fucking fat guy like baby fat stomach come from?
[414:19.46]It's from drinking Dunkin Donuts coffee every day.
[414:21.64]But I never put sugar in my coffee.
[414:23.76]I didn't have sugar in my coffee.
[414:27.73]There was no calories in my coffee.
[414:29.19]There's probably like 30 calories in my coffee every morning.
[414:37.72]It happened when you built the birdhouse.
[414:38.90]You became a real dad.
[414:43.02]I'm fucking old, man.
[414:44.07]I'm getting old.
[414:48.93]33, 34, 35 is gonna creep up so quickly.
[414:52.52]And that's gonna... I didn't think I was ever gonna be that old.
[414:57.11]When you're 20, when you're like 23, 24, 25, you never look at the future and go, oh man, yeah, 33.
[415:06.64]No, no, you're like, I'm cool, like I'm hot, 25.
[415:10.12]I can do this.
[415:12.54]I don't have a fucking Attack on Titan stomach.
[415:17.59]And then, boom, hits you.
[415:29.09]But thank you again, Duke, for your huge amount of money here.
[415:34.12]Thank you.
[415:36.14]No V-thanks for the $1.
[415:37.16]I can't wait for the beta compilation.
[415:40.76]Hashtag charity.
[415:42.73]I haven't said it enough times for there to be a compilation.
[415:44.63]That compilation would be like five seconds.
[415:49.33]Bro, I'm 19 and I'm going to be 20 next year.
[415:51.71]What the fuck?
[415:54.91]You have no idea.
[415:57.47]What's the Palpatine quote where he's talking about being really old and like you need to be, what is it?
[416:05.14]You have no idea what you're talking about.
[416:14.76]It's something like that.
[416:25.81]19, 19.
[416:26.01]If I was 19, I would be sprinting.
[416:31.72]I'd be jumping just because.
[416:34.54]Because I could.
[416:35.12]I would like lie on my back and spin.
[416:45.37]I can't lie on my back and spin anymore.
[416:47.25]I used to do that.
[416:49.63]It was so much fun.
[417:06.47]You can be bionically remade in ten years, don't worry.
[417:08.65]Eh, it'll be fine.
[417:12.13]Uh, thank you Saranwraps for the one dollar.
[417:13.65]Started watching you less than two weeks ago.
[417:16.17]And I already adore your streams.
[417:18.26]First of all, welcome.
[417:20.50]Um... There are a lot of new people over the last few months.
[417:24.26]So...
[417:26.04]We all welcome you.
[417:26.87]Thanks for even checking out the stream in the first place.
[417:29.33]You do so much for your viewers, skits, etc.
[417:31.83]that other streamers would never even consider.
[417:34.29]Even as a new fan of your streams are always a gift.
[417:36.93]Hope your 2019 is fantastic.
[417:38.77]Hashtag charity.
[417:41.28]Thank you, Saran Wraps.
[417:44.22]Hope you stick around.
[417:45.58]Because there's way more to see in 2019.
[417:54.21]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[417:55.63]Sorry for torturing you with those Fortnite references.
[417:58.23]Here's some music to make up for it.
[418:00.33]Hashtag charity.
[418:05.01]Oh, this is that song.
[418:06.19]This is a good song.
[418:15.07]Is this my favorite song from Hotline Miami 2?
[418:20.38]I thought it was going to be Fortnite music I did.
[418:22.10]Yeah.
[418:27.30]Uh, Duke, again.
[418:29.62]Duke gave another $11 here.
[418:31.32]Bringing you up to $81.
[418:34.90]Thank you so much, Duke.
[418:37.61]Tell you the truth, you are Spider-Man.
[418:39.09]Don't fool us any longer.
[418:40.37]Alright, I'll rip off the rubber mask.
[418:42.63]And there's Peter Parker under there.
[418:52.09]There's, oh, there's Peter Parker.
[418:55.36]But thank you, Duke.
[418:57.60]And you also say, active duty, U.S.
[418:59.50]Army.
[419:01.16]You're the best, though, man.
[419:02.04]And like I said, keep doing you.
[419:08.05]Good luck on your deployment, Duke.
[419:18.26]We'll be here when you get back.
[419:28.60]And that is going to conclude our bit reading portion of the stream.
[419:45.03]Which takes us to the subscriber credits.
[419:52.45]Subscribers, subscribers, here they come.
[419:57.90]tons and tons of resubs and new subs.
[420:02.39]Every stream.
[420:09.04]Read credits.
[420:09.82]Alright, fine.
[420:10.74]Isn't that what you're used to?
[420:26.82]Whoa, he's doing it so fast.
[420:29.12]Read faster.
[420:29.88]Okay, hold on.
[420:44.85]I was seeing how embarrassing that was with the mic off.
[420:47.85]And it was very embarrassing and I'm glad I didn't do that.
[420:56.68]Joke dropped.
[420:57.66]Joke dropped.
[420:58.68]Joke dropped.
[421:02.36]Hey, thank you, Scribble, for the $1.
[421:04.84]Haha, there's more bits to read.
[421:06.08]Hashtag charity.
[421:09.92]Using beatboxing?
[421:10.64]Fine.
[421:14.80]Thank you, Scribble, for the $1.
[421:19.85]More beatboxing?
[421:20.61]Alright.
[421:21.01]Okay.
[421:24.17]Okay.
[421:29.08]Same time tomorrow or normal time?
[421:33.74]I don't know.
[421:35.08]Just because of me going to bed and getting up such strange times.
[421:40.25]I'm probably gonna... I really don't know.
[421:48.01]Because there's a chance that I go eat food and then go food blood pass out.
[421:54.75]It's possible.
[421:55.53]I'm like making such a big deal out of this.
[421:57.37]I had my blood taken yesterday.
[422:00.95]It's like, oh, you see the thing is I had my blood taken yesterday.
[422:03.71]So I'm going to go to bed.
[422:05.51]Like I'm blowing that out of proportion so much.
[422:10.73]I'm over-exaggerating that so much.
[422:15.31]More beatbox?
[422:15.91]Okay.
[422:20.68]But I think probably around the normal time.
[422:24.04]Because there's a chance that I'll stay up.
[422:31.30]But there's an equal chance that I fall asleep in like an hour or two.
[422:35.56]So I really don't know.
[422:36.64]Forgive me.
[422:37.20]I'm sorry.
[422:37.70]I kind of screwed up my sleep schedule here yesterday.
[422:41.52]But there will be a stream tomorrow at some point.
[422:43.88]I will figure out when.
[422:46.21]Definitely, definitely after like noon.
[422:50.47]And absolutely before...
[422:53.53]like five or four pacific time so between like 12 and 4 p.m pacific is when the stream is going to start a beatbox again okay
[423:22.83]And that is the end of the subs.
[423:25.91]Thank you all so much.
[423:28.87]Please install BTTV.
[423:33.59]I don't think I will.
[423:37.12]I want to be able to say in an interview, you know, in like a couple of years.
[423:41.42]So, uh, Jerma985, what is like some advice you can give to the, you know, you're the number one streamer on Earth.
[423:48.38]What's some advice you can give to some fellow streamers?
[423:53.24]No, I never installed BTV.
[423:54.90]I never did.
[424:08.92]I can't use computers.
[424:09.78]I just use blackboards.
[424:11.02]Please hire me.
[424:11.96]I don't even... I hate blackboards.
[424:13.34]They make my ears hurt.
[424:16.02]Anytime I'm in a room with a blackboard, I want to leave the room.
[424:19.04]Because I just imagine the sounds coming out of the blackboards.
[424:33.06]The sound makes me ill.
[424:36.28]He can't see the D emote.
[424:40.18]It's alright, I got my own emotes.
[424:42.42]See, that one is this.
[424:46.20]Right?
[424:47.10]Here's the dance, you go, oh, the dance one was Sour Please, right?
[424:52.42]I have one of those.
[424:53.86]See?
[424:55.50]I, look, I'm, I'm dancing over there.
[424:58.75]Sour Please.
[425:05.04]It's not animated.
[425:06.56]Yeah, but just imagine it is.
[425:11.45]I thought that was a nose wipe.
[425:12.59]Yeah, but people use it in different contexts.
[425:19.53]Where's the Wowie emote?
[425:22.91]I'm really showing my under-pressure vocabulary skills on these Hotline Miami 2 streams.
[425:29.05]Wowie!
[425:30.81]Whoa!
[425:32.50]Wowo!
[425:42.28]But anyways, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.
[425:44.52]Not exactly sure what we're going to be doing, but I'm sure we'll come up with something.
[425:49.18]See you soon.
[425:49.90]Take care.
[425:51.29]Have a great rest of your night.
[425:52.35]And ta-ta for now.
[425:57.11]And Broluck just gave a dollar.
[425:58.45]I missed the stream.
[425:59.25]Here's a dollar to show you my apology.
[426:00.85]You don't have to be sorry.
[426:04.51]You can't make every single stream.
[426:06.59]It's alright.
[426:08.45]See you tomorrow.
[426:11.72]Thank you.
