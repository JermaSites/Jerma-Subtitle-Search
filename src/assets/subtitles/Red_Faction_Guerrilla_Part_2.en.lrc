[00:34.07]Hey!
[00:36.35]Welcome to another edition of... The Stream!
[00:41.04]Glad you guys are catching this on... on fuckin' ABC.
[00:45.22]It follows the life and times of a streamer.
[00:47.54]It's a comedy, though.
[00:49.04]All kinds of crazy things are bound to happen.
[00:51.94]Like, the stream dies halfway through!
[00:53.60]My bitrate goes down!
[00:54.84]Whoa!
[00:55.62]Audience fuckin' cracks up.
[01:02.31]Oh, but hi.
[01:02.73]How are you?
[01:05.34]Good evening.
[01:05.76]How are you?
[01:06.12]I'm good.
[01:07.36]I'm pretty good.
[01:10.06]The app works.
[01:10.76]What app?
[01:11.31]Twitch app?
[01:16.11]What's my favorite internet meme?
[01:17.97]Doggo.
[01:19.83]Definitely fucking Doggo, right?
[01:26.29]Give me one second.
[01:27.81]Gonna make a tweet.
[01:28.51]We're gonna go back to Red Faction Guerrilla.
[01:31.13]One of my, like, surprisingly, like, favorite fucking video games.
[01:35.05]Like, of the last, like, two years.
[01:36.97]Somehow.
[01:37.59]Magically.
[01:38.03]Don't know how that happened.
[01:39.59]But I'll be here in, like, two minutes.
[01:40.67]I'm gonna get started.
[01:41.66]See you in a minute.
[02:29.06]Okay, let's get this going.
[02:30.70]A couple of things over here.
[02:34.99]This and that.
[02:37.11]Turn that off.
[02:38.53]Hey, look at that.
[02:38.99]There's a video game over here.
[02:43.21]All the audio seems to be correct.
[02:45.86]I believe it is.
[02:48.32]Okay, let's just do this.
[02:50.22]We got to make the display better.
[02:51.60]Because we have to do this every time we go to the menu.
[02:57.55]There we go.
[02:59.14]Okay, load game.
[02:59.92]We're going to leave, literally go right where we left off the last time.
[03:07.10]We're on dust.
[03:09.56]Let's go.
[03:09.90]Alright, so back to Red Faction.
[03:15.77]This game's fucking awesome.
[03:17.33]I've had like a million years of fun for some reason.
[03:20.85]Is my FOV, did my FOV change?
[03:24.31]What happened here?
[03:25.77]No, it's still at 70.
[03:26.61]Maybe I'm just seeing things.
[03:27.93]Am I seeing things?
[03:30.11]Maybe I am.
[03:32.09]You're sacrificing going out to dinner to hang out here.
[03:34.99]Oh.
[03:36.65]I really appreciate that.
[03:37.65]Do I have any scrap money?
[03:40.99]We gotta start the fucking stream off strong.
[03:42.61]I gotta hit this guy in the face with a hammer.
[03:45.14]Oh.
[03:46.56]Well, I was trying to make a joke.
[03:48.56]Oh, I did hit him.
[03:49.18]Okay, well, I was trying to not hit him, but I hit him right in the fucking face.
[03:56.74]In fact, I may have killed this guy, but nobody seems to know.
[03:59.57]No, he's still breathing.
[04:00.35]No, that's just like the fucking dead air being squeezed out of him.
[04:05.25]Alright.
[04:07.35]Let's see here.
[04:08.05]We got... I do have a lot.
[04:11.89]I think the last time I played, though, I was going to do the rocket launcher.
[04:16.08]Yeah, I'm going to get the rocket launcher next.
[04:17.72]Alright, where am I going?
[04:21.86]Where to...
[04:25.89]Let's get a big picture look here.
[04:27.69]Okay, I can go down here and liberate this town.
[04:33.51]Dead air is the medical term.
[04:36.71]It could be.
[04:37.19]I could do the mission too.
[04:38.01]Where's the mission?
[04:41.05]It's down here.
[04:42.35]I'm going to go down here.
[04:44.25]On the way down, we're going to liberate this place.
[04:46.95]So I'm going to destroy this place and liberate it.
[04:49.49]Collect some scrap along the way and be addicted to this game.
[04:52.61]Sounds like a plan.
[04:55.37]I need... Alright, let's... Garbage truck or... Do I... I'm not even... I'm not even going to give the other thing a look at all.
[05:09.66]Five minutes exactly.
[05:11.59]Hey, I was early.
[05:12.17]I'm like 15 minutes early.
[05:24.83]I donated some bits at the start of last stream and they never got read.
[05:27.65]Is it possible to fix that?
[05:30.56]I didn't even see it.
[05:32.76]Well, sorry Dakota.
[05:35.02]Thank you for the bits though, whenever you gave them.
[05:37.24]Now you see these, these just popped up right now.
[05:41.32]Sinister, thanks for the bits.
[05:42.34]Did it just say cheer 100?
[05:46.56]Fix it.
[05:47.84]Alright, I'm gonna fix it, don't you worry.
[05:53.37]Sometimes I miss bits.
[05:56.57]That happens.
[05:57.91]I have ADHD.
[05:59.01]Sometimes my brain is a fucking moron.
[06:01.87]Well, they know we're here.
[06:07.10]Well, I guess I should just get out here.
[06:09.38]Let's take out the radio tower.
[06:15.60]Let's make sure... Well, this guy's fucking dead.
[06:19.86]No, he's not.
[06:20.52]Not quite.
[06:24.51]There goes that.
[06:25.13]Give me the scrap.
[06:31.31]Nope.
[06:31.75]No, let's do the hammer.
[06:36.17]Really?
[06:36.41]I love the screams in this game.
[06:43.10]They're so perfect.
[06:45.24]Oh, wait.
[06:45.52]I changed it.
[06:50.46]What is this purple fucking fire that's just raining down on me?
[06:54.29]I need to figure out a way to...
[06:57.43]You know, the rocket launcher is gonna make this shit so much better.
[07:00.67]I can just foresee me launching rockets into this guy's house.
[07:04.48]It's gonna be perfect.
[07:05.44]Well, don't stand still.
[07:06.68]This game is like Mad Max.
[07:17.80]Alright, I need cover.
[07:19.00]I'm gonna like die here.
[07:23.53]Easy, easy, easy.
[07:26.90]AD, AD.
[07:27.58]Yeah, I'm just pressing AD over and over again.
[07:30.48]Rocket launcher has low ammo.
[07:32.86]Yeah, but does it destroy things very easily?
[07:35.18]I would assume it does.
[07:38.47]Well, we're here.
[07:39.61]Might as well get rid of this thing.
[07:40.75]Might as well get rid of this fucking propaganda.
[07:45.83]I didn't get it.
[07:48.89]Got it.
[07:51.47]Dude, I swear I gotta keep thinking these guys are fucking bad guys.
[07:54.99]Every time.
[08:01.89]Oh, you killed your own guy.
[08:03.59]Alright, I've done that before too.
[08:05.77]I know how easy it is to accidentally do that shit.
[08:11.35]Shit, I didn't get it.
[08:22.61]Watch it.
[08:23.54]Watch it!
[08:27.14]I need more of these.
[08:27.78]Because I don't have enough fucking charges.
[08:30.38]Are you serious, dude?
[08:31.80]What is on his head?
[08:34.10]Oh, I threw... I thought that guy had like a face mask on.
[08:40.83]No, no, that was just one of my fucking charges.
[08:43.37]This is not gonna work.
[08:48.51]There's way too many fucking people.
[08:50.71]I'm gonna die.
[08:52.41]I think I'm dead here.
[08:54.43]I have to go for the money here.
[08:58.43]Yeah, look at how many people are there.
[08:59.73]I gotta go for the money.
[09:03.35]I got one reinforcement.
[09:04.61]That's great.
[09:06.35]We gotta go for the money.
[09:12.34]I'm running out of ammo.
[09:13.50]I have like 500 people behind me.
[09:15.12]Alright, here we go.
[09:20.16]Open this.
[09:21.40]Take the free shit.
[09:25.86]Okay, get out of there.
[09:32.95]I swear to God, I keep thinking, every time I see one of these bad, like, these good guys, they're actually a bad guy in my brain.
[09:38.79]I can't jump over that?
[09:39.45]What, are you fucking serious?
[09:43.13]You can't jump over that?
[09:44.40]You can't jump over that!
[09:45.56]Okay.
[09:49.38]Now we're gonna play, like, Ring Around the Rosie.
[09:51.52]What am I thinking?
[09:52.42]It's just, I can destroy shit in this game.
[09:54.22]What am I, no, rules don't apply.
[09:56.32]Regular video game rules don't apply here.
[09:59.88]I can literally smash it.
[10:01.34]What am I doing?
[10:03.18]Nah, I can't go through that fence.
[10:06.18]Rules don't apply.
[10:07.18]I love how this guy is very concerned about the boat.
[10:16.65]Alright, wait, wait, wait, I gotta get her.
[10:20.69]Oh, 81%.
[10:20.85]This thing is huge.
[10:23.27]Get away from me.
[10:24.77]Is it coming down?
[10:28.41]Oh god, the whole thing's coming down.
[10:30.61]Holy shit!
[10:33.05]Oh my god!
[10:33.81]Oh my god!
[10:35.27]Stay alive!
[10:36.96]Jesus!
[10:39.94]Oh!
[10:43.80]Oh!
[10:44.96]Where is he?
[10:45.94]Is that a good guy?
[10:51.01]Whew!
[10:53.05]Oh my god.
[10:54.89]Okay.
[10:55.57]Well, can I get any scrap from that?
[11:01.73]I gotta just like sprint through here.
[11:04.23]Just pick it up.
[11:05.57]Is there anything we can pick up?
[11:06.55]Yeah, like a little bit.
[11:07.65]Not even worth it.
[11:08.25]Just run.
[11:08.55]That was fucking insane.
[11:20.80]What happened to that guy?
[11:21.58]Why are they like...
[11:23.85]It's always a different person, too.
[11:25.25]Have you guys noticed that?
[11:27.49]Every time one of these, like, gorilla people shows up, it's a different guy.
[11:32.41]And they just keep appearing out of nowhere.
[11:35.02]I gotta get rid of this, too.
[11:36.90]Okay, I got, like, some time here just to give it a look.
[11:39.98]Any more, like, random scrap or anything?
[11:45.14]Oh, that was awesome.
[11:47.34]Here we go.
[11:49.64]What a fucking fun game.
[11:51.98]Every moment is intense in this game.
[11:56.16]I don't know if I'm going to be able to get this.
[12:01.44]I don't think I can get rid of this.
[12:02.58]I'm going to have to do this with a hammer.
[12:04.30]But will I be able to pull that off?
[12:05.89]I'm not so sure.
[12:16.03]Should I hammer time this?
[12:21.16]I'm looking at running into these people.
[12:22.34]I got to make this not... I got to chill out here.
[12:31.78]Where's my friend?
[12:32.50]I don't know if it's worth it.
[12:40.31]Oh!
[12:41.75]No!
[12:51.29]Sorry, I got it.
[12:52.91]It's destroyed.
[12:57.89]I didn't get to destroy the whole thing, but I destroyed the thing that was the most important.
[13:02.54]Just quit the game.
[13:12.16]It would have been if you didn't debate how long it was worth it.
[13:15.03]Yeah, I couldn't really go anywhere.
[13:17.21]That was like a do or die situation, but whatever.
[13:20.97]I'm gonna go down here.
[13:23.81]I almost have this whole place done.
[13:29.63]Wait, do I have... Wait a minute.
[13:32.53]After that mission, after you die, do you... Okay, yeah.
[13:34.73]All your shit gets refilled.
[13:35.61]Good.
[13:45.57]It's a good thing that sometimes I forget that even if you die, like, the thing that you did... As long as it's not a mission, it still counts, so... Alright, that person got annihilated.
[14:03.92]Not my intention, but it still happened.
[14:07.22]Alright, let's take care of this.
[14:11.94]One, two.
[14:16.91]I love, like, the green gas that comes out of there.
[14:20.25]I do have enough of the rocket launcher, though.
[14:21.49]Should I just go get the rocket?
[14:22.45]No, we'll do the rocket launcher after.
[14:23.61]Take care of that after.
[14:25.36]Uh, in here.
[14:39.01]Aren't those gas I'm running over like oh look at all these look at all these gases.
[14:43.89]I have to do this One two three we'll do five we'll do one two three four here Wait are they gonna be mad at me of course they are I'm not even doing that they're doing that Like they're blowing these up like why the fuck are you shooting these I?
[15:03.85]Don't have to detonate them these guys will do it themselves apparently and what is this I?
[15:09.94]Go to the raid area.
[15:12.50]You're doing a raid?
[15:13.18]Alright.
[15:21.19]Sounds like a plan, I guess.
[15:26.27]Kill him.
[15:28.35]How many people can fit in this?
[15:32.89]Do that a million more times.
[15:34.31]Alright, you get in too.
[15:35.07]Can you get in here?
[15:38.12]Well, it looks like it's just... Oh, hold on.
[15:39.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[15:39.74]We gotta pick up this scrap.
[15:40.66]There's a ton of it.
[15:44.82]Is this guy... Okay.
[15:49.16]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:49.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:50.68]Let me... Let me, like, pick this scrap up first before you get up there and cause problems.
[15:56.85]Get out of the way.
[15:57.61]Can you get in?
[16:05.19]This guy's just gonna run behind me, huh?
[16:08.30]Where's the raid area?
[16:10.15]Oh, Jesus, man.
[16:11.03]You're gonna make me go all the way over here?
[16:12.41]Alright, fine.
[16:12.89]Well, I gotta be slow so my friend can catch up.
[16:18.73]Because there's no such thing as a three-person vehicle in this game, apparently.
[16:21.94]As of right now.
[16:31.38]Really?
[16:31.70]You have to fucking do that?
[16:33.81]Honest to God?
[16:36.82]Good shooting, but now I have to do this Let's just break this with the hammer everyone out out out This game is fucking perfect to it.
[16:57.82]Oh That was one of them
[17:04.47]Come on.
[17:05.19]Take it down.
[17:07.75]I'm gonna accidentally hit one of these.
[17:08.99]I swear to God, you need to get out of the way.
[17:10.71]Move.
[17:10.99]Just move backwards.
[17:11.71]A little.
[17:12.03]Just a little.
[17:13.27]Just stand away from this.
[17:15.33]Would you come this close to the construction site when some guy's, like, fucking fixing a house?
[17:19.62]No.
[17:20.08]You would wear safety equipment.
[17:22.20]Unless you have- I don't see a hard hat on any of you fucking idiots.
[17:25.16]Why are they leaving?
[17:25.78]Why are you leaving?
[17:26.32]What are they doing?
[17:26.72]What are you guys doing?
[17:27.74]Hey!
[17:30.21]They're no longer, like, part of the mission anymore.
[17:36.22]What, I took... They got, like, angry?
[17:37.72]Alright, well, apparently I'm not on that mission anymore.
[17:44.43]Because I, like, stopped to break a house.
[17:47.41]Apparently they weren't happy about that.
[17:52.21]There it is.
[17:52.67]Okay.
[17:53.83]Building destroyed.
[17:56.46]Too bad it don't matter because now I'm not even on that mission anymore.
[17:58.96]Okay, they're gone.
[18:04.10]That's fine.
[18:07.05]We wiped.
[18:08.35]No, we didn't wipe.
[18:09.31]It's called, like, the tank had to go eat dinner, and my healer had to fucking, like, his mom was calling him, so he had to leave.
[18:15.84]They both just DC'd.
[18:19.24]Without warning, by the way.
[18:21.70]And let me ask you fucking this.
[18:23.16]Why are you going to a raid if you know you're going out to dinner with your wife?
[18:27.01]You know, that always used to fucking irritate me a little bit.
[18:30.33]You're gonna sign up for, like, a two-hour fucking four-hour raid, and, like, an hour into that, you gotta go to dinner with your wife?
[18:37.16]What are you thinking?
[18:40.32]Actually, I am right here.
[18:41.12]I can do it again.
[18:42.94]Alright, well let's do it.
[18:46.68]Can we get in a car that has more than two people?
[18:50.66]Can you guys get in this?
[18:52.38]More than one of you.
[18:57.70]Look at this.
[18:58.06]See?
[18:58.26]They can get in the back of these garbage trucks.
[19:02.54]Alright, there's one guy in the back.
[19:05.23]I got a guy in the back.
[19:06.53]Perfect.
[19:08.28]So this guy's gonna- I'm just gonna dump this guy out of the garbage truck.
[19:16.78]This guy's gonna fall out of the back.
[19:19.20]You wanna see like a guarantee?
[19:20.89]This guy ain't gonna make it into this place.
[19:26.75]We'll come back and deal with this later.
[19:39.73]Am I sure about this?
[19:40.97]Am I being asked if I'm sure about this?
[19:43.17]I missed a little.
[19:43.73]Ah, you know, I did miss some propaganda.
[19:45.21]You're right.
[19:46.37]Remember our homeland.
[19:48.11]Okay, well, this propaganda has to come down.
[19:53.50]Jumping swing.
[19:55.12]One hit.
[19:58.12]Alright, make sure nobody... It didn't hit anybody.
[19:59.62]Good.
[20:03.04]Alright, back in the garbage truck.
[20:10.13]Come on in.
[20:13.81]That guy rushed to sit down.
[20:17.45]So we have to infiltrate this building?
[20:21.09]I kind of want this thing.
[20:21.87]I want like the children's toy.
[20:27.02]Alright.
[20:28.02]Go to the raid.
[20:28.78]It's over here.
[20:39.40]Alright, here it is.
[20:40.22]So, what do I... Oh, we just have to clear it.
[20:42.06]Just clear it out.
[20:42.63]Alright, let's dump this guy.
[20:45.21]The red faction is raiding an EDF-owned building.
[20:47.53]You win the raid when the number of EDF is reduced to zero or the building is destroyed.
[20:52.87]Alright.
[20:54.25]Get on out.
[20:57.11]There's so many people.
[20:57.95]No, don't even get out of the car.
[21:01.47]Just, why get out of the car?
[21:03.15]This thing is just free kills.
[21:06.92]Just ram into everybody.
[21:09.30]And eventually all of them will be dead.
[21:11.00]We don't have to leave.
[21:12.16]Just track them down and crush them.
[21:15.50]Sometimes there's going to be some collateral damage, but that doesn't even matter.
[21:23.45]Oh shit, actually we gotta get out.
[21:24.71]We do have to get out.
[21:27.35]There's too many of them.
[21:28.11]It's like a tie game right now.
[21:31.03]We have too many tickers.
[21:33.29]We have to do kill confirmed right now.
[21:39.79]Fuck is happening right now.
[21:40.79]Who's doing this?
[21:42.39]Somebody blew up the fucking building.
[21:43.51]Okay.
[21:43.77]Well, it wasn't me That was a car.
[21:46.03]Somebody drove a car into the wait.
[21:47.63]What whose car is that?
[21:52.33]I Don't understand somebody fucking drove a car over here and exploded the building Alright, that's how that happened we're winning the fight guys somebody did a clown car bomb Alright, let's take it out
[22:09.99]One more guy up there.
[22:10.77]He'll be dead in a second.
[22:13.25]Look at that.
[22:14.43]Got him.
[22:19.03]That, like, made a loud noise in my ear.
[22:25.84]What the fuck is happening right now?
[22:27.36]What is going on?
[22:28.54]Who's doing this?
[22:33.46]Why were there mines?
[22:34.44]Why were there mines in the fucking house?
[22:37.74]I didn't do anything.
[22:48.66]Well, I win.
[22:49.34]Okay, that's fine.
[22:51.06]Seriously, what the fuck?
[22:56.88]Hold on.
[22:57.50]They were doing that to the building.
[22:59.63]So the building came down and was in shambles and they decided they were going to throw grenades at it while people were still standing on it.
[23:08.49]What on Earth are you guys fucking doing?
[23:10.75]Let's get the rocket launcher.
[23:13.11]Bingo.
[23:14.84]We have the rocket launcher.
[23:17.71]Alright, let's get it.
[23:18.41]Let's set it on our little thing here.
[23:20.87]Let's go to the ammo container.
[23:27.32]Jerma sets the charges.
[23:28.22]I didn't set the charges.
[23:29.24]That was them.
[23:30.84]They were like throwing bombs in there.
[23:32.32]Somebody drove a clown car into the building and it exploded.
[23:34.64]And then they were throwing grenades at me.
[23:37.66]Okay, rocket launcher.
[23:38.56]Let's replace four.
[23:41.09]Because I have that as a machine gun.
[23:44.11]Let's take a look at this thing.
[23:48.06]Alright, does this have... This is a rocket?
[23:50.58]Wait.
[23:51.76]Okay, this is the rocket launcher.
[23:55.24]What kind of rocket launcher is... How do you hold a rocket launcher like this?
[24:01.76]What?
[24:04.05]I'm so confused.
[24:06.09]It's like a grenade launcher?
[24:09.47]Rocket launcher?
[24:13.71]Okay, well that's interesting.
[24:19.45]Alright, so it comes out... I get it.
[24:22.07]It comes out as like a little ball and then propels forward.
[24:24.70]Makes sense.
[24:26.34]It's like a bootleg piece of shit rocket launcher, but you know what?
[24:28.86]It's gonna get the job done.
[24:33.28]Still shoots them straight.
[24:34.20]Okay.
[24:36.34]Do a rocket jump?
[24:37.56]It's probably possible.
[24:41.52]The building explodes once you defeat it in a raid.
[24:43.96]Well, yeah, but wasn't it already destroyed in the ground?
[24:47.00]Why would it need to explode?
[24:49.80]Sitting around dodging mines.
[24:51.22]Alright.
[24:52.14]Let's all just calm down.
[24:53.30]I need to calm down.
[24:54.24]My blood pressure's a little elevated at the moment.
[25:02.57]That was fucking funny though.
[25:09.53]Propaganda.
[25:11.39]Always get rid of the propaganda.
[25:16.68]Drive over it again to pick up the free shit.
[25:20.82]I really like that mechanic.
[25:24.12]Is there any scrap left?
[25:25.06]Or did I already pick it up?
[25:25.76]Do you just grab it automatically when you run one of these over?
[25:27.96]I don't know.
[25:28.68]Whatever.
[25:33.56]Why can I not turn the car?
[25:49.76]I couldn't turn the car and then that happened What is okay honest to God man you guys are hearing that shit Some this some real annoying audio issues right now where it goes like it's like popping the my ears.
[26:11.58]Oh
[26:18.60]That's like, ow.
[26:20.54]That sounds like a mic breaking.
[26:21.72]Yeah, but that's like, that's coming from the game.
[26:30.22]I almost have complete, no, just spin it over.
[26:32.29]Don't, don't do this.
[26:35.47]Yeah, nice propaganda windmill.
[26:37.77]I love how it actually was propaganda.
[26:41.33]That adds to my stupid narrative of like, oh, the energy.
[26:47.27]Oil doesn't work.
[26:48.67]Clean energy doesn't work.
[26:52.61]No energy works.
[26:54.99]We need to go back to fucking carrying people.
[26:59.86]That's how it's really gonna be.
[27:00.82]We're gonna end up like Fred Flintstone.
[27:03.64]That's the real energy.
[27:07.04]We're gonna have to run our cars.
[27:08.31]Everyone in the backseat's gonna have to sprint.
[27:17.06]Alright, so that guy just got angry because I came up a little too fast on him.
[27:24.70]That guy was scared and that angered him, apparently.
[27:26.87]To a point where he was gonna do that and try to kill me.
[27:34.47]Energy.
[27:36.13]Don't- Just wait, guys.
[27:37.27]Just hold on.
[27:38.43]Everyone's talking about, like, energy, energy.
[27:39.89]Just wait, like, another fucking hundred years.
[27:42.17]Somebody's gonna be- Some fucking old moron's gonna be digging in his backyard.
[27:49.18]And he's going to hit fucking something.
[27:50.46]He's going to hit a solid object.
[27:51.50]He's going to be looking for coins.
[27:54.84]He's going to hit a solid object like... Oh, I'm just looking for gold coins.
[27:59.46]He's going to find some alien material.
[28:07.42]And it's going to be like the new energy.
[28:09.54]And it's going to be impossible to get rid of.
[28:19.91]That guy will make like 600 trillion dollars.
[28:26.09]And I can't break this.
[28:27.01]Like, you're telling me I can't drive into this?
[28:32.71]It's gonna be a thing that's like harder than steel, softer than fucking gold.
[28:39.19]It's gonna cost less than like tissue paper.
[28:41.23]And it's gonna be fucking gifted to us by the aliens.
[28:50.78]Get rid of this.
[28:52.62]Nobody can have this but me.
[28:57.87]Alright, let's get back to the show here.
[29:00.39]No, get in the car and drive in.
[29:01.69]No, you know what?
[29:02.09]Just get out of the car.
[29:04.23]I'm gonna use the hammer.
[29:11.18]Take out all the supports.
[29:15.36]I've gotten a lot of scrap just from running around.
[29:23.00]This is too much of a piece of crap for the rocket launcher.
[29:26.70]Can you tell me I can't break this?
[29:30.57]What are these wedged in?
[29:31.35]Is it because the ladder was in the way?
[29:34.91]I need to upgrade this hammer.
[29:40.49]There we go.
[29:47.38]Alright, let's take this guy out.
[29:53.90]Alright, let's keep moving.
[30:00.74]Let's go.
[30:00.96]I'm going to take his car because it's brand new.
[30:07.73]You going to get in?
[30:08.17]I don't think he is.
[30:11.06]Alright, why don't you get in?
[30:12.04]Use the super machine gun.
[30:17.61]Alright, well, if you're not going to be useful, then get out of the way.
[30:25.12]I love when somebody is on like the machine.
[30:28.56]Alright, I can get this one.
[30:34.23]Blow him up!
[30:38.39]Anybody behind?
[30:39.41]Actually, a lot of people behind.
[30:40.59]Let's keep going.
[30:48.10]Uh, let me just do the mission.
[30:49.32]We haven't done a mission in like more than an hour or two.
[30:53.14]Well, that's not the mission, but oh boy, oh boy.
[30:55.46]Okay.
[30:56.62]Well, looks like, uh, looks like we're gonna have to get out of here.
[31:06.65]Three, four, five.
[31:10.21]Is there anything in here?
[31:11.75]Well, who gives a shit?
[31:21.64]Ooh, my frame rate.
[31:23.04]My frame rate going down.
[31:27.90]Scrap.
[31:28.36]Give it to me.
[31:30.08]Give me the scrap.
[31:30.58]Give me the scrap.
[31:34.26]How is that?
[31:34.80]Let's just fucking use these.
[31:45.85]Come on.
[31:46.11]I got rid of that alien fucking technology.
[31:49.71]Got it.
[31:54.25]No, it's ours.
[31:55.61]We've claimed this territory in the name of the Resistance!
[32:06.74]There's so much going on, I can't even see.
[32:08.17]At least there's a lot of people here.
[32:13.07]I'm actually gonna be out of ammo.
[32:21.16]Alright, no more jokes.
[32:22.03]Like, I'm joking right now, and I need to be running.
[32:27.51]You know what I'm saying?
[32:28.15]Like, I'm doing a callback.
[32:30.47]And I didn't even say anything, but you guys know what the callback was.
[32:36.73]I should just get rid of that too, shouldn't I?
[32:42.52]You know what?
[32:42.92]I'm here.
[32:44.16]I might as well try to get rid of it with a rocket launcher or something.
[32:50.95]Okay, well, rocket launcher is pretty fucking great.
[32:53.35]No.
[32:58.17]How can you still be alive after that?
[32:59.55]I don't even know.
[33:02.61]Alright, where is it?
[33:03.27]Is it down this way?
[33:04.79]Straight ahead?
[33:10.91]You got behind.
[33:11.59]Where the fuck are you?
[33:15.97]I need guns.
[33:16.89]Give me some ammo.
[33:20.95]This lady just showed up with nothing.
[33:22.77]This old lady showed up and just got shot like three times, and now she's dead.
[33:27.04]Well, at least you got like gotten away.
[33:28.48]Alright, bring out the rocket launcher.
[33:33.66]Let's see what this thing can do.
[33:38.05]Pretty good.
[33:40.79]Pretty cool, actually.
[33:43.77]Nice.
[33:45.87]There it is.
[33:46.31]Chemical Depot Supply Office.
[33:48.11]That's too many words.
[33:49.65]That's too many things to be.
[33:54.07]Pick up the scrap.
[33:55.90]And then get the fuck out of here.
[33:56.96]Alright, now we can start the mission.
[34:02.26]If I can get out.
[34:07.91]Again, like I thought that was a... No, that's a member of the resistance.
[34:10.89]Fine.
[34:16.93]Let's do it.
[34:17.35]No, I have to hide.
[34:21.88]Are they here to help me?
[34:27.38]Of course.
[34:28.16]Of course this just happens now.
[34:29.36]I have to get this alert to green.
[34:34.36]While we start a war over here.
[34:39.07]No, it comes out like the brainless AI.
[34:41.81]Nobody even driving this car.
[34:43.29]Oh yeah, there is.
[34:46.95]Okay, you can get out and help, instead of holding the fucking horn down.
[34:53.90]Hey, get out of the way, I'm trying to go somewhere.
[35:00.48]Look at this- No, it's just chaos.
[35:05.29]Get out of the fucking way then!
[35:08.91]Get me in your car!
[35:10.81]I gotta go, I gotta get the alert to green.
[35:13.37]Oh, please!
[35:22.01]Get out of the way.
[35:22.81]Everybody, get out of the way.
[35:27.17]Take out that fucking propaganda.
[35:32.60]Get this thing to green.
[35:33.92]Ram this thing.
[35:37.20]Oh, well, that... And now this is gonna explode.
[35:41.76]Come on, come on, come on.
[35:42.56]Just like GTA, you turn around... Wow.
[35:45.65]Holy shit.
[35:46.83]Oh, come on.
[35:47.31]Fucking land on this guy.
[35:48.35]Please land on him.
[35:50.27]Oh, that would have been so... Oh.
[35:56.28]Imagine if that came all the way down and fucking crushed that guy.
[36:01.82]He's like a tourist bus.
[36:05.84]Aye, aye, aye.
[36:10.15]I just want to get away.
[36:10.99]I got to like drive away from this.
[36:14.63]You idiot.
[36:15.69]You idiot.
[36:17.39]You fucking idiot.
[36:18.89]Oh my god.
[36:20.97]Don't drive towards the bullets.
[36:22.75]Drive away from the bullets.
[36:26.64]I need to go hide in a mountain somewhere.
[36:33.72]Like up here.
[36:34.58]Just go up here.
[36:38.20]Go up here and find like a side street to go down.
[36:40.38]Just like in GTA.
[36:45.07]There.
[36:47.13]So hide like in somebody's alley.
[36:50.75]And they already know where I am.
[36:52.43]Of course they do.
[36:57.27]Come on.
[36:58.33]You guys are relentless.
[36:59.90]Leave me alone, please.
[37:02.04]They're relentless.
[37:03.70]I have nowhere to go.
[37:05.82]I gotta go down a fucking mountain alley to get away from these people.
[37:09.78]I have no bullets.
[37:10.92]Oh my lord.
[37:15.51]Get away from me, please!
[37:20.85]I can't even jump up this.
[37:22.31]Oh, it's over here.
[37:29.94]Get out of the way!
[37:35.98]I thought I could hide.
[37:39.50]Why did I leave the car?
[37:40.41]Because they could see me no matter where I go.
[37:46.54]Jesus Christ.
[37:56.91]Go to a safe house and reset the alert level?
[37:58.81]Wait, you can do that?
[37:59.51]There's like paint shops?
[38:01.97]Whatever, I'm right here.
[38:04.83]Were you trying to rocket jump over them?
[38:06.47]No, I was trying just to do a last-ditch effort to corner myself like a bear.
[38:14.00]And get shot by, like, fucking 30 people.
[38:17.10]That was my intelligent decision.
[38:18.34]I should have just broke the mountain.
[38:22.98]If you could do that, that actually would be fucking hilarious.
[38:25.06]If you could just, like, terraform the mountain.
[38:35.79]Alright, now I don't have... I have a green level.
[38:38.47]I'm not gonna be in any trouble now.
[38:42.36]Okay, that's it.
[38:44.22]Very nice.
[38:45.34]Let's just get to the mission and actually do this.
[38:52.20]Just like in Minecraft.
[38:53.38]Yep.
[38:55.44]That's right, guys.
[38:56.00]Just like in Minecraft.
[38:57.20]The world's greatest video game.
[38:59.13]Holy shit.
[38:59.87]Look at all that ore.
[39:07.71]Just like in that video game, Minecraft.
[39:10.37]Earth's greatest achievement.
[39:13.84]Isn't it gonna be so interesting when Notch is like 90 years old, they're gonna fucking wheel him up.
[39:20.54]And it's gonna be like the great video game awards of like 220 or whatever.
[39:26.76]Or 2020.
[39:27.26]You know, he's gonna wheel up there, he's gonna be like 98 in a fucking wheelchair and he's gonna be like... They're gonna be like playing trumpets and shit.
[39:40.00]World's greatest video game achievement!
[39:43.72]goes to Notch.
[39:47.22]And he's gonna fucking grab the mic and it's gonna fucking hurt everybody's ears and he's gonna say a bunch of fucked up shit in the mic.
[40:02.51]So in three years.
[40:03.25]2020 is only three years.
[40:10.45]Yeah, I was talking like 2-2-0-0.
[40:14.48]Like 2,220.
[40:14.92]Oh, we got more shit to get here.
[40:19.08]Let's see to get Pat now.
[40:23.00]We have to do the actual mission.
[40:28.38]Yeah, 2,220.
[40:29.06]Come on, do I have to speak more clearly?
[40:35.72]I gotta get that plasma.
[40:37.93]I'm getting scrap a lot faster, though.
[40:43.31]That's what I wanted to do last time.
[40:48.47]Notch is going to be 230... Yeah, because by that point... Guys, you don't understand.
[40:53.95]Notch is going to upload his consciousness into Minecraft.
[40:57.85]They'll pull him up.
[40:58.45]It'll be like his blocky face.
[41:05.20]It'll be him as a Minecraft character.
[41:08.36]Wait, what the fuck is that?
[41:11.54]Can you get sucked into those tornadoes?
[41:14.24]Alright, here we go.
[41:14.66]Oh, man.
[41:14.80]Steal a walker.
[41:16.38]Oh, man.
[41:34.30]That's cool.
[41:34.60]Maybe in a little bit.
[41:35.80]Maybe we'll do that.
[41:36.61]I don't want to do any cheats.
[41:38.05]I'm having fun with the game.
[41:50.51]Every time I introduce like cheats or a console the whole game like goes to shit, and then we can never recover I happen dark, but like I finished dark Messiah But once we brought in like cheats and console commands like that game like that it went south real quick Beat the game normally, but still like you know I was cheated a few times, but thank you though Kasi thanks for the bits as well the blue EDF crates give you scrap and
[42:15.35]Good to know.
[42:16.67]Gunther, thank you for the $10 earlier.
[42:18.29]Jerma, you've given me a lot more than $10 worth of laughs, but this is a good start to paying you back.
[42:23.43]Thank you.
[42:24.96]Well, Gunther, as long as you're enjoying yourself, no amount of money, I don't care.
[42:30.30]You don't have to give me money to pay me for like... I mean, it's alright.
[42:36.38]That means a fucking lot, though.
[42:37.98]I hope you know that.
[42:39.71]Curly Snail, thank you for the $5.
[42:42.01]Hey Germans, this is probably the last time I can sub slash give you money before I go off to uni and become a poor student.
[42:47.43]Just wanted to say thank you for the near year worth of entertainment streams and for the years before on YouTube and picking me up whenever I felt down.
[42:54.97]Thanks, man.
[42:56.34]Well, I'm glad you could get some enjoyment out of any streams or videos.
[43:02.18]I hope you're enjoying yourselves.
[43:04.50]I really do, guys.
[43:05.96]It means a lot.
[43:09.63]Alright, recover the walker.
[43:12.59]So we just gotta get in there, right?
[43:13.71]I guess I'm just gonna go over there.
[43:18.55]Yeah, and then, like, I mean, I've said this a lot of times before, but don't... If you, like, can't give money or something, don't, like, think that I somehow magically deserve all your money, you know?
[43:32.71]Any amount of money that anybody gives me is very appreciated.
[43:37.55]Don't ever feel like, oh man, I can't give you money anymore.
[43:40.98]That's totally fucking cool, man.
[43:42.86]Don't even worry about that at all.
[43:48.76]Why are you shooting me?
[43:50.54]You just made that really easy.
[43:54.44]You made that so easy.
[43:55.58]You laid down on the ground for me to be able to do that.
[43:59.05]And now all your friends are angry.
[44:04.39]Alright, how do we get up there without being seen?
[44:06.59]Is there a way I can sneak around?
[44:08.05]I think we have to go this way.
[44:14.29]That guy wanted me to run him over.
[44:21.77]I guess I have to sneak in through here.
[44:23.21]Alright, let's sneak in.
[44:30.51]Alright, we successfully snuck into the facility.
[44:43.42]Oh, come on!
[44:45.08]I can't sneak in here?
[44:45.94]You're telling me I can't fucking sneak in?
[44:50.56]Fine, I'll sneak in the old-fashioned way.
[44:57.07]Alright, get in.
[44:58.73]Holy shit.
[44:59.85]Are we actually getting inside of this thing?
[45:03.51]Oh boy, how do I use it?
[45:08.51]Okay, hold on a minute.
[45:09.35]I get, like, gorilla arms?
[45:12.13]WASD to move the walker.
[45:13.39]Press right mouse or left mouse to swing the arms.
[45:17.25]Press space or left control to sweep the arms.
[45:22.84]Oh my god.
[45:25.30]Are you shitting me?
[45:27.08]Oh!
[45:32.08]This is fucking awesome.
[45:35.09]It's like I sweep my hands across the table and like pull all the drinks with us.
[45:40.51]I gotta get this out.
[45:41.17]I gotta get this out.
[45:41.89]We can't, like, fuck around right now.
[45:48.80]Hey, how do I get this out of here?
[45:52.32]Where am I supposed to bring it?
[45:53.96]Bring it on in?
[45:54.48]You make that sound so easy.
[45:58.98]I hopefully... Can I get, like, sniped out of here?
[46:01.10]Oh...
[46:09.31]Shit's just blowing up all around me.
[46:10.59]I gotta move.
[46:12.31]We gotta just get out of here.
[46:13.31]Can I just walk through everything?
[46:18.09]Alright, I'm just gonna go this way.
[46:21.67]I'm just walking it out of the base.
[46:23.38]Like he told me.
[46:24.06]Like a good boy.
[46:27.50]Come on, I gotta like throw this guy in the air.
[46:34.40]I'm just like scooping him up.
[46:36.08]This is perfect.
[46:36.96]Alright, let's go.
[46:39.15]I'm right here.
[46:39.63]What do you mean get back in the walker?
[46:43.05]How do I get on there?
[46:43.81]Get on this ship.
[46:45.87]What do you want me to do?
[46:47.61]What the fuck are you doing?
[46:48.53]Why can't I do this?
[46:49.21]What do you mean let's go?
[46:52.07]I'm fucking right here.
[46:56.00]Get it?
[46:57.26]There we go.
[46:57.78]What the fuck?
[47:02.16]Hold off the enemy.
[47:05.32]Oh dear lord.
[47:08.35]That wasn't even an enemy.
[47:11.57]This is just pure destruction.
[47:12.89]I love it.
[47:15.78]Didn't miss one.
[47:16.32]I haven't missed one shot yet, guys.
[47:21.40]Yep.
[47:22.00]You heard it.
[47:22.40]You heard it.
[47:22.84]Not missed one shot.
[47:26.90]Haven't missed a shot.
[47:28.50]Those connect.
[47:34.49]Come on.
[47:34.69]I gotta get the points.
[47:40.49]Got it.
[47:40.75]Okay.
[47:41.25]At least I got one.
[47:46.75]Did I go through?
[47:49.96]Get that propaganda.
[47:50.60]Come on.
[47:53.42]Damn it.
[47:56.88]You gotta be shitting me here.
[47:58.06]Come on.
[48:05.08]That guy just got out of the car like nothing happened.
[48:08.99]There's so many opportunities to blow shit up and I haven't been doing it.
[48:12.27]Blow up the gas station.
[48:18.18]Oh god.
[48:19.80]Easy with that.
[48:20.48]I don't want to shoot these too close.
[48:21.96]Double tap!
[48:22.38]Double tap!
[48:22.94]Triple tap!
[48:23.98]Fuck!
[48:26.62]That would have been so cool.
[48:36.03]Dude, blowing shit up has never been so much fun.
[48:38.49]Really hasn't.
[48:44.44]Protect the drug.
[48:45.00]I'm almost ready to move on to the next zone.
[48:50.10]Very stealthy.
[48:51.22]I agree.
[48:56.80]Oh, unfortunate.
[49:06.38]I'm doing actually a pretty good job blowing up all these buildings that I couldn't do before.
[49:09.64]Couldn't blow them up before.
[49:10.58]Oh, what a disappointment.
[49:16.81]I couldn't get it.
[49:17.61]The truck is almost destroyed.
[49:22.07]So, it was that.
[49:30.72]You know, I shot that, but I didn't expect that to happen.
[49:36.47]They actually blew the bridge.
[49:38.07]I didn't really have anything to do with that.
[49:43.05]Now we can never leave.
[49:49.51]What did... Why?
[49:53.53]Why?
[49:59.85]Uncalled for, man.
[50:03.97]Here comes another guy.
[50:04.71]Do you know the bridge is out?
[50:07.46]What are you gonna do?
[50:08.04]Are you turning around because the bridge is out, or are you gonna go the other way?
[50:14.74]Yeah, at least the AI is smart enough to know that they can't go over the bridge.
[50:20.50]Yeah.
[50:21.32]Okay, for a second I thought the AI was, like, really dumb.
[50:26.66]Yeah, okay, just checking, just making sure.
[50:29.62]What's next on the list?
[50:33.17]Alright.
[50:34.41]We have to just get rid of 10 more EDF-controlled things.
[50:39.63]Or 10 points worth.
[50:41.97]Hmm.
[50:43.07]What's this?
[50:44.41]Use a reference point for travel.
[50:45.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:46.40]What is this, though?
[50:48.00]Collateral damage.
[50:48.74]Ride shotgun for Jenkins and destroy EDF property.
[50:51.32]You know, let's... This one's right here.
[50:55.52]Let's go to this one.
[50:57.70]It's literally right next to us.
[51:07.63]I can make it.
[51:08.11]Easy.
[51:10.63]We're good.
[51:12.83]Yeah, old... The bridge had bombs.
[51:16.82]Yeah, so what do these people do?
[51:17.96]They just end up turning around.
[51:26.43]Look at all these, this line of cars.
[51:30.07]Oh, they do go the right way.
[51:31.09]Okay.
[51:34.58]jump the bridge?
[51:35.26]There's no jump there.
[51:36.02]I wouldn't make it.
[51:36.58]I can go this way.
[51:39.36]Sneak across.
[51:41.84]Let's take the back roads.
[51:43.54]Because it is right here.
[51:44.40]I feel like I'm doing the thing in GTA 5.
[51:51.47]Where you ride a truck up Mount Chiliad.
[51:54.95]Because it's just like everything feels very similar to that.
[51:58.87]Okay.
[51:59.11]Okay.
[52:04.83]This should do it and then it opens up the next part of the game.
[52:06.69]At least that's how I understand things.
[52:13.77]Let's do this first.
[52:16.29]Mount Chiliad.
[52:18.83]What?
[52:21.43]Mount Chiliad?
[52:26.47]How do you guys say it?
[52:28.69]Chillad?
[52:29.27]It's Chiliad.
[52:33.11]It's a fucking French building.
[52:34.64]The French made it.
[52:37.02]The French, like, just dumped a bunch of sand.
[52:38.70]I have a lot of scrap.
[52:47.17]I could probably upgrade something.
[52:51.59]Hmm.
[52:52.29]Alright, well, let's go.
[52:52.75]Yeah, and then the guy, like, threw his flag into the ground and said, I proclaim this mauchilia.
[53:06.41]I get to use the walker again?
[53:10.05]Kill 60 people?
[53:11.31]Okay.
[53:12.03]Easy.
[53:14.34]No, this is different.
[53:16.12]This is different.
[53:17.26]I'm in like the fucking... I'm in the aliens machine.
[53:20.64]What?
[53:25.34]Oh my god.
[53:26.10]I get to be in a literal jetpack alien machine.
[53:33.17]This thing is... Okay, this thing is so much cooler.
[53:38.77]Is there no amount of interesting things that are in this game?
[53:42.79]Is there no bounds to that?
[53:50.10]Why would you go over the fucking edge?
[53:52.62]Come on, I gotta make this happen.
[53:58.96]Oh, this is great.
[53:59.92]I don't know if I'm gonna beat this though.
[54:04.32]I'm like blowing up too easily here.
[54:12.48]20 people?
[54:15.89]It's so overwhelming right now.
[54:24.03]Keep them focused.
[54:24.89]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[54:26.83]Just flipping cars.
[54:28.07]No big deal.
[54:28.65]Oh, I love that.
[54:35.11]And you can come up with a tomahawk.
[54:36.35]Flip them and then tomahawk them.
[54:37.88]Or no, just toss them in the air and have them explode.
[54:39.66]Perfect.
[54:43.70]This fucking can opener is like the best thing in the game.
[54:45.98]Flip him!
[54:52.94]Flip him!
[54:56.20]Halfway there.
[54:57.84]But I'm halfway dead too.
[54:59.02]That's the one bad thing.
[55:04.85]Oh god.
[55:08.75]35?
[55:09.03]I gotta move.
[55:11.27]I gotta get out of the way here.
[55:12.11]I'm gonna like die.
[55:17.46]I can't be, like, just taking punches like that.
[55:23.96]Okay, how about... Just come around now.
[55:25.65]I gotta stay here.
[55:33.11]Holy shit.
[55:35.85]Am I hiding in this?
[55:40.92]How do you fight this guy?
[55:42.40]You don't.
[55:42.96]You just lose.
[55:50.00]Keep going.
[55:51.16]Oh, it's gonna be close.
[55:55.94]It's gonna be close, guys.
[56:01.47]Go on.
[56:02.67]Go on.
[56:04.67]Go on.
[56:05.87]Almost there.
[56:07.79]What?
[56:08.21]There's just more trucks.
[56:09.21]I don't know what's happening.
[56:12.70]Oh, dear.
[56:15.22]Oh, dear.
[56:16.40]Come on.
[56:17.16]Two more.
[56:18.90]One more guy.
[56:20.83]I don't know who's still alive.
[56:22.28]These cars are all full of people apparently.
[56:23.90]Alright, I got it.
[56:28.60]I did it.
[56:28.90]It was that easy.
[56:35.27]That was actually kind of intense in the end there.
[56:37.95]Personnel detector unlocked.
[56:40.75]This is the upgrade table to purchase, unlock weapons and upgrades.
[56:43.56]That's how you unlock shit, huh?
[56:44.90]Okay.
[56:45.80]Well, they got to zero.
[56:50.21]I got 60.
[56:50.51]So that, I unlocked this.
[56:55.61]Um... This is just right here.
[57:03.50]I want to unlock more things, though.
[57:08.60]I have all my weapons and gear and stuff.
[57:10.94]Cool.
[57:15.52]I was trying to be a dick, and I dicked myself.
[57:19.36]Okay.
[57:22.29]If you complete all missions in a sector, you can't do any more guerrilla actions, really.
[57:25.57]Hmm.
[57:47.63]okay so if I if I do this then I can't do the other things in the area should I do some of those things first or is it no are we are we good should we just go thank you amish robot for the five bucks uh saying that you haven't missed a shot is the most surefire way to miss Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa it's true thank you amish for these five bucks also thank you ratbag for the bits been watching since late 2011.
[58:17.30]Thanks for everything, Star.
[58:18.94]My name is Jeremy!
[58:21.18]That's a different person!
[58:25.64]Thank you, though.
[58:30.47]Gorilla actions will disappear until you finish the story and then come back.
[58:32.89]Okay.
[58:35.75]Got him.
[58:41.55]A rat bag.
[58:43.03]Isn't that a fucking... That's from Shadow of Mordor.
[58:48.89]Well, let's just do it.
[58:53.11]Alright, so... Let's just go.
[59:04.32]Let's go get the bad guys.
[59:09.10]Everyone's fleeing.
[59:10.91]Everyone's fleeing.
[59:11.97]Don't hit me.
[59:12.53]I probably shouldn't be walking up the road.
[59:16.15]But I am.
[59:21.84]Well, I'm getting hell rained on me.
[59:25.14]Watch out for the garbage truck.
[59:26.82]Hey, they destroyed their own propaganda.
[59:28.51]I don't have to do it now.
[59:29.35]Thanks, guys.
[59:33.83]I'll pick up the scrap metal too, won't I?
[59:41.87]So, what's the plan here?
[59:45.26]Save those people and supplies.
[59:54.46]Well, I got too caught up in, like, destroying that stupid thing.
[59:57.36]Alright, save the people and supplies.
[60:00.34]You got it.
[60:04.12]People?
[60:04.42]Alright, save the people.
[60:05.79]Go.
[60:06.11]Alright, just walking into them makes them leave.
[60:09.61]Got it.
[60:10.19]So, is this completed?
[60:12.67]Alright, completed.
[60:13.23]Don't get yourself killed, lady.
[60:23.02]I'm just waiting for her to get, like, crushed.
[60:26.30]Alright, go on.
[60:28.22]Get out of here.
[60:29.08]This is no place for a human.
[60:37.87]Keep going.
[60:41.91]Save the supply.
[60:42.79]Well, I don't even know what... I'm just going by...
[60:46.44]I'm going by the exclamation points on the map.
[60:48.88]Well, my priority list.
[60:50.68]Come on, go, go, go, go, go.
[60:51.73]Get out.
[60:52.85]Get out.
[60:54.31]Run.
[60:55.17]Get out.
[60:56.39]Run.
[60:56.71]Thank you.
[60:58.37]I was about to throw a chair at this lady.
[61:00.15]Alright, you're gone.
[61:00.77]Good.
[61:07.39]In here.
[61:07.79]How are there ten tasks here?
[61:12.48]Am I missing something?
[61:13.22]There we go.
[61:17.75]Got it.
[61:18.21]Found some medicine.
[61:18.95]Mm-hmm.
[61:26.72]577.
[61:26.74]They're going to blow these buildings up.
[61:31.90]I might as well take the stuff, right?
[61:36.66]How are you?
[61:37.02]Alright, get out of here.
[61:39.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[61:48.56]Give me that thing!
[61:48.98]Give me!
[61:49.38]What is this thing?!
[61:51.44]Holy shit, I got like a giant spear now.
[61:54.10]Never- I'm never getting rid of this.
[61:55.26]How do I ca- how do I keep this?
[61:56.42]Wait, that- is that the hammer?
[61:58.15]What's going on here?
[61:58.77]I'm so- I'm confused.
[62:02.39]Uh, am I gonna be able to get this back?
[62:09.37]I don't know- did I just get rid of my fucking machine gun?
[62:16.37]This thing is insane.
[62:21.16]Holy shit in my pants.
[62:27.04]I don't want to die.
[62:35.17]Fuck you.
[62:35.63]No.
[62:45.10]Dude, that guy... I can't... You know what I'm laughing about.
[62:49.17]I can't even... You know what I'm laughing about a little bit here.
[62:54.21]Like, we're aware of it, alright?
[63:02.52]That's why you wear your fucking seatbelt, man.
[63:09.28]Let's just replace some of this.
[63:12.77]This thing is pretty badass, though.
[63:17.81]Just laughing about it a little.
[63:19.11]Just a little.
[63:20.27]Not very much.
[63:23.43]This thing is... Wait, what about this weird gun?
[63:25.73]Is that a rifle or is that like a weird gun?
[63:29.91]I can't even stop to think about this for a second.
[63:35.96]What is this?
[63:36.32]Weird gun?
[63:37.18]Okay, this is a weird gun.
[63:38.50]I don't own the weird gun.
[63:43.02]It's a weird shotgun.
[63:46.04]It's pretty great, actually.
[63:47.09]Really, this thing's... That's a lot of range on a shotgun.
[64:01.32]Run.
[64:01.58]Don't get hit.
[64:02.74]Watch it.
[64:03.12]Watch it.
[64:03.72]Watch it.
[64:06.46]It's a one-shot kill, too.
[64:07.70]This thing is... And there's, like, people over here.
[64:14.13]Good thing you guys are idiots.
[64:15.57]Otherwise, this would be difficult.
[64:16.59]Alright, couple more.
[64:20.23]And here.
[64:28.14]Let's get the ammo.
[64:29.34]Why not?
[64:30.88]This is a weird gun.
[64:34.34]It's like a pronged shotgun.
[64:35.70]Alright, where is this?
[64:37.72]Upstairs?
[64:38.32]Where the fuck is it?
[64:38.96]Come on.
[64:45.33]Pick this up.
[64:48.57]There's a guy coming up the stairs.
[64:53.33]Fuck it, let's just go this way and wrap around.
[64:58.61]That's far away.
[64:59.45]How far away is that?
[65:01.21]Oh, shit.
[65:03.30]That's, like, super far away.
[65:04.84]I gotta get in a car.
[65:12.56]Don't you idiots have cars?
[65:13.60]I don't think there's a car over here.
[65:16.48]Or more... I think this is a person.
[65:24.73]Wait.
[65:25.41]No.
[65:27.81]Around this way.
[65:28.85]There it is.
[65:29.39]There's the files.
[65:30.19]Oh, I thought I was going to pick up the whole filing cabinet.
[65:38.54]I got the filing cabinet.
[65:40.08]I'm ready.
[65:42.10]Is there no car?
[65:43.48]I need a car.
[65:44.88]That's so far away.
[65:50.16]Here we go.
[65:50.64]A car.
[65:54.57]Thanks for the car.
[65:59.73]This thing is nice.
[66:00.45]Does this thing have any guns on it?
[66:08.70]No, I don't think so.
[66:14.24]Alright, you can get out of the way now, please.
[66:20.92]That thing was just on me for way too long.
[66:22.63]That was on me for so long.
[66:23.77]Like, an irritably long time.
[66:29.57]It's a reverse tricycle.
[66:34.80]That barricade should have been able to be driven through.
[66:36.84]Come on.
[66:47.38]Alright, make it easy.
[66:49.64]Come on, let's make it real easy.
[66:51.14]Gotta go up.
[66:51.76]Ah!
[66:52.65]Ah!
[66:54.49]What?
[66:56.53]What?!
[66:58.19]What are you... A colonist was killed at the apartment?
[67:09.75]Are you fucking shitting me?
[67:17.61]I didn't do that, I drove into like a b-b- Oh man!
[67:24.93]Are you fucking kidding me?
[67:33.00]So hold on, are you telling me that a guy died up the stairs that I was in?
[67:38.42]And I have to do the whole thing again?
[67:39.70]Alright, I gotta go there first.
[67:42.42]I gotta go there first!
[67:45.29]I took too long?
[67:46.23]What?
[67:47.23]I walked in the building and in like three seconds the mission failed.
[67:54.26]Okay.
[67:55.68]I'm going up here first.
[67:56.66]Because like, if that happens again, I don't want to do that last.
[68:05.58]Like, forget about that stuff.
[68:06.52]That stuff is easy.
[68:07.84]This is the problem here.
[68:14.78]So I gotta... What if the person dies after I tell them to leave?
[68:17.28]Alright, here we are.
[68:21.44]Get in.
[68:21.72]Okay, here we go.
[68:30.96]I think the person's actually downstairs in this one.
[68:33.18]Alright, well... There, here you are.
[68:37.12]Alright, go.
[68:38.42]You're clear.
[68:42.93]This one too.
[68:43.43]This guy is upstairs, apparently.
[68:50.82]Don't die.
[68:52.06]Don't die while I try to find where you are.
[68:53.92]Alright, go.
[69:01.42]Get out.
[69:02.20]Please don't die.
[69:03.80]Okay, we're good.
[69:08.20]We're good, right?
[69:09.24]Good?
[69:09.72]Done?
[69:11.17]Done.
[69:11.73]Garbage truck.
[69:13.11]Hurry up.
[69:18.37]And I'll back it up to here and just do this whole bunch.
[69:23.92]I'm going the right fucking way.
[69:28.30]And I picked the worst possible vehicle to do this in.
[69:31.28]There was like a fast buggy right there.
[69:33.52]And I'm still in it.
[69:34.46]And I'm dedicated.
[69:37.05]I have to stay dedicated.
[69:44.33]Yeah, we're being a serious gamer right now.
[69:47.25]I don't have to do this again.
[69:48.19]You know, I'm passing it.
[69:49.85]Just go up and do this one.
[69:51.31]This three here.
[69:54.29]This one.
[69:54.77]Yeah, it's right here.
[69:55.49]Let's get this over with.
[70:02.48]Get out.
[70:07.78]Smash a couple of windows upstairs.
[70:14.44]Take it.
[70:18.58]Over the sofa.
[70:19.43]Into this room.
[70:21.49]Clean.
[70:22.09]Nice and clean.
[70:24.01]That was quick and clean.
[70:27.79]Through this wall.
[70:29.51]There's a wall already broken, but don't even matter.
[70:31.16]Right here.
[70:36.10]Get in.
[70:37.80]Nice and clean.
[70:44.20]What did I do?
[70:44.62]Where is it?
[70:50.82]Where is it?
[70:51.46]Is it the fi- I broke the data.
[71:14.35]That's possible.
[71:16.81]I can break the data.
[71:18.09]I can fucking... The important documents were destroyed because I broke the door down.
[71:26.94]Are you... Are you serious?
[71:31.04]Okay.
[71:39.53]Well, now I know.
[71:41.33]Even... Yeah.
[71:44.64]So things can do- oh my god.
[71:49.40]I hit the filing cabinet with the hammer, so the mission failed.
[71:55.18]Oh lord.
[72:00.47]You can't pick the fucking- I hit the filing cabinet with a hammer, I can't pick it up?
[72:06.93]Oh my god.
[72:07.97]Come on, man.
[72:13.11]I took the USB out too early.
[72:15.23]Well... So many things can go wrong on this mission.
[72:19.96]Do we understand this?
[72:22.38]Sometimes a random explosion is gonna destroy the filing cabinet.
[72:26.78]Sometimes a random person is gonna die.
[72:31.62]I might like break a wall accidentally and have it break the fucking mission.
[72:37.76]Holy hell.
[72:41.11]Alright, no fucking around this time.
[72:44.47]Get out.
[72:46.61]Building's coming down.
[72:47.53]Leave the building, please.
[72:51.21]You are right here.
[72:53.63]So now, I'm not gonna break anything.
[72:57.43]Don't you fucking dare.
[73:00.13]Don't you dare.
[73:01.36]Get out of there before this falls.
[73:02.58]Please get out.
[73:03.68]Alright, thank god.
[73:04.68]Don't go back in the building.
[73:05.92]You're going back in the building.
[73:07.60]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[73:08.16]It's over.
[73:08.56]It's not my problem anymore.
[73:12.23]Not my issue anymore.
[73:19.96]It's like taunting me, throwing those at me.
[73:21.66]Alright, do not break these buildings under any circumstance.
[73:27.45]This is a straight up dead serious mode.
[73:29.57]Nope, don't break anything.
[73:32.59]Don't hurt anyone.
[73:34.97]Watch out for the Tusken Raiders.
[73:39.32]I tried to make this quick.
[73:40.46]I tried to jump over the cliff last time.
[73:41.98]And I'm gonna do it again.
[73:44.44]But I'm gonna be careful this time.
[73:49.91]Here we go.
[73:51.81]Nice and easy.
[73:52.43]Don't break any walls.
[73:55.85]Otherwise, you're gonna be sad.
[73:57.67]I can break a window.
[73:58.67]But no.
[73:59.43]No.
[73:59.65]Go in the front door.
[74:02.65]That's a good guy.
[74:04.23]Just go in the front door and touch the machine.
[74:07.04]And it'll be good to go.
[74:08.26]Done.
[74:08.38]Done.
[74:09.84]Do the same thing.
[74:10.64]Alright, now that the data's good, I can break the wall to get out.
[74:13.05]I can exit that way, but not enter that way.
[74:16.35]This one's upstairs, so I can break this wall.
[74:23.81]There it is.
[74:24.59]Okay, this one's done.
[74:26.49]Only one more.
[74:29.29]We can break shit to get out, but not to get in.
[74:34.55]Go on the front door.
[74:37.45]Okay.
[74:38.15]Filing cabinets.
[74:40.07]Done.
[74:42.59]Complete the mission.
[74:49.08]Go, go, go, go, go.
[74:50.42]Forget that.
[74:50.92]Wait.
[74:56.91]I'm gonna say that that was alright.
[74:58.21]We'll pretend like that was totally fine.
[75:01.71]And that was all supposed to happen.
[75:03.57]That's good.
[75:11.18]Watch out.
[75:12.23]Here we go.
[75:13.05]Finish it up.
[75:14.01]Don't fail this.
[75:14.99]Why are you in the way?
[75:22.91]Let's make it happen.
[75:24.97]Be gentle.
[75:28.65]That's the name of this mission.
[75:30.67]They need to rename this mission, Be Gentle.

[77:36.11]There's a car.
[77:37.37]You dick!
[77:38.63]It's okay, this car still works.
[77:43.80]The car still is functioning.
[77:45.14]That would have been so disappointing.
[77:50.93]Wow, what a painful mission this was.
[77:52.75]Fight back?
[77:53.61]You want me to fight back there?
[77:54.93]That's a certain death.
[77:58.35]Alright, good to go.
[77:58.93]Ashes to ashes, complete.
[78:11.60]You know, you gotta pick your battles.
[78:12.96]That was not one of them.
[78:19.91]Cutscene.
[78:20.27]Gotta have talk.
[78:24.09]There's no sex scene.
[78:25.27]What are you talking about?
[78:44.22]It's an old GTX 260 from Nvidia.
[78:52.42]It runs games at 45 frames a second.
[78:59.64]Can't let them have it.
[79:00.26]It's a fucking relic.
[79:12.53]It's my GPU.
[79:13.96]It's my current GPU.
[79:18.08]Wow, did he already just said about the fucking Nvidia GPUs?
[79:28.33]Holy shit.
[79:30.21]That's like fucking slander.
[79:31.27]They should sue this guy.
[79:32.14]They should sue this fucking game company.
[79:33.62]They should sue the game.
[79:39.78]Nano Forge unlocked.
[79:40.96]Visit the upgrade table to purchase unlocked weapons.
[79:42.78]Okay.
[79:43.62]Warp to safe house.
[79:44.88]That's good.
[79:46.74]Visit the upgrade table to purchase... I gotta unlock that shit?
[79:49.40]Okay.
[79:49.72]What the hell was that?
[79:53.64]What was that?
[79:54.20]We just got like a fucking news feed.
[79:56.04]That was like Bloomberg.
[79:57.86]For one second.
[79:59.44]Okay.
[80:00.82]Apparently like the Dow Jones is down, I guess.
[80:05.82]Where are we now?
[80:07.18]Over here.
[80:08.24]I guess I can't go back to the...
[80:11.44]Let's talk.
[80:13.26]Let's talk.
[80:14.40]Let's see what you got.

[80:20.50]Rocket ammo.
[80:21.16]Multi rockets.
[80:23.16]Oh, damn.
[80:24.18]Heat seeking rockets.
[80:27.16]Nano forge.
[80:31.09]700.
[80:32.55]Personnel detector.
[80:33.73]Gorilla Express is the warp.
[80:35.39]Alright.
[80:35.75]Hold on.
[80:36.15]I got to piss.
[80:37.89]I got to pee.
[80:38.71]Give me one second.
[80:39.37]I'll be right back, guys.
[80:41.69]Go grab yourself a snack while I pee.
[82:33.96]OK.
[82:34.10]Turn that off.
[82:39.04]I have to go to the main menu again because I cannot change my settings.
[82:46.03]I have to go to the menu for settings.
[82:49.11]That's good.
[82:49.61]That's good.
[82:50.35]Alright.
[82:50.69]Let me just move out of here.
[82:54.47]Back it up.
[82:57.83]Save it.
[83:00.82]Save game.
[83:03.00]Badlands.
[83:05.46]Get to the main menu, make it full screen again.
[83:07.22]Because I can't, I have to like exit to the main menu to do this every time.
[83:16.17]Unfortunately.
[83:21.12]I never, wait, what do you mean I never shit?
[83:23.54]What are you talking about?
[83:25.96]What, you guys, do you guys think I'm gonna like go take a shit on stream?
[83:32.35]What are you talking about?
[83:33.51]Guys, I'll be right back.
[83:34.59]I'm going to go take a shit.
[83:36.69]I'll be gone for like 40 minutes.
[83:37.79]Are you serious?
[83:43.61]Alright.
[83:44.89]Let's go.
[83:48.15]A lot of people are saying buy the nano gun.
[83:52.65]Let's take a look at this.
[83:54.03]It doesn't even tell me what it does.
[83:55.47]Nano forge.
[83:56.47]700 fucking salvage.
[84:00.38]So this is worth doing?
[84:01.52]Because this is my entire bank account.
[84:12.06]Apparently it's worth it.
[84:13.67]I don't know what... NanoForge.
[84:16.93]Let's get it.
[84:19.71]Don't even know what it does.
[84:20.75]But that was my entire bank account.
[84:23.31]There's a cutscene for this item.
[84:28.40]We got a cutscene for this one.
[84:31.46]So is this a sniper rifle?
[84:34.26]Wow, that's fucking sad.
[84:36.02]$700 cutscene.
[85:01.14]No, it's a sniper rifle.
[85:02.68]That thing sucks.
[85:03.78]Thanks for the 700 bucks.
[85:08.45]It shoots explosive bullets.
[85:09.97]Why are you so shocked by that?
[85:12.65]Not bad for a can opener.
[85:14.15]I don't see why the EDF's chasing this thing so hard.
[85:20.73]If I can replicate... I have a rocket launcher that does the same thing.
[85:23.60]That's reason enough for the EDF to worry.
[85:30.70]rocket launcher was 400 less expensive this is just like got a special brand on it you know what I mean this is like an alienware computer it's like a thousand dollars more expensive
[85:57.67]It's an Alienware sniper rifle.
[86:00.38]Okay.
[86:01.00]So let's go look at it.
[86:02.04]Let's go check it out.
[86:04.18]I have an arsenal now.
[86:05.38]Let's change.
[86:05.96]Okay.
[86:06.10]I don't want to keep the charges.
[86:08.10]Assault rifle.
[86:10.78]I don't want the pistol.
[86:11.60]Rocket launcher.
[86:13.08]Peacekeeper.
[86:13.90]That's the... Okay.
[86:16.55]Nano rifle.
[86:19.67]Let's try this.
[86:20.97]And what happened to my... Didn't I unlock the...
[86:31.88]I thought I could pick... I thought you guys were saying if I picked up the weird weapons that those marauders carry, I can use them.
[86:43.55]Okay.
[86:45.05]Nano rifle.
[86:46.31]Let's give it a try.
[86:50.03]I can do it to people, it said.
[86:51.51]Let's see if this thing's worth it.
[86:59.42]What a great weapon.
[87:02.41]What a great weapon.
[87:05.25]It just puts like a cloud of like gas in front of their face.
[87:07.71]That's kind of cool actually.
[87:12.49]Alright, it's kind of cool.
[87:17.08]Alright.
[87:23.80]So it just shoots melted butter.
[87:25.59]Alright, that's nice.
[87:27.97]Now we got some more stuff to do.
[87:32.13]There's a mission all the way down there.
[87:33.55]Let's, you know, there's a couple of things here.
[87:34.95]Let's do some grill actions, right?
[87:42.76]It's kind of cool.
[87:44.30]It works on like EDF soldiers.
[87:45.86]Alright, well, we'll give it a go for a little bit.
[87:52.12]Fuck it, the melted butter gun.
[87:53.60]Yeah.
[87:57.11]Oh, we got some scrap metal over here.
[88:06.76]face on this thing.
[88:12.06]I jumped out and I hit my fucking head.
[88:19.78]Like, I bumped my head on the fucking bunk bed.
[88:23.54]I bumped his fucking head on the bunk bed.
[88:24.80]Yeah, well, these can't be destroyed, so let's go.
[88:33.73]Uh...
[88:35.46]I guess you can.
[88:35.98]They can be broken a little bit, these little purple ones.
[88:38.02]Strategically located throughout the world, apparently.
[88:50.59]Up here.
[88:53.86]Ooh, look at all these scrumptious fucking ores.
[89:00.26]I want to upgrade this.
[89:06.95]Why would you leave your car there?
[89:08.12]Probably because you got, like, attacked.
[89:09.46]That's all I can think of.
[89:16.98]Jump, dude.
[89:20.13]Okay.
[89:20.97]Two more.
[89:24.77]Twelve.
[89:27.51]I don't care about that.
[89:28.81]I want to do this.
[89:30.30]Actually, is that guy going to pass through here?
[89:32.56]He might.
[89:37.96]Oh shit, no.
[89:38.60]Okay, he is.
[89:39.22]Is he driving down this way?
[89:46.12]The traitor's just ahead of me.
[89:51.58]What?
[89:53.40]Pick up the data.
[89:55.74]Is it just automatically putting me on this mission, or is this part of the guerrilla action?
[90:04.84]Uh, well, I guess we're on this now.
[90:08.16]We're doing this, I guess.
[90:14.23]I didn't want to do this.
[90:15.15]I wanted to go do the gorilla action, but apparently I can see through mountains.
[90:21.25]I'm gonna sneeze.
[90:22.69]Oh, I'm sorry.
[90:24.63]I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it.
[90:30.14]I got it.
[90:33.36]What did I get?
[90:36.64]What mission am I doing right now?
[90:41.74]I was just over here.
[90:47.56]I gotta lose my alert level now.
[90:53.55]Alright.
[90:57.87]Thanks for the free money.
[91:01.45]Badlands complete.
[91:02.39]Minus 20.
[91:03.09]Interesting.
[91:03.63]Cool.
[91:05.23]I guess I'll take it.
[91:07.48]This one is what?
[91:10.42]Transport.
[91:10.94]Get the vehicle to a safe house.
[91:12.88]I hate these ones, but we'll do it.
[91:14.30]We'll give it a try.
[91:17.04]The trader got killed on his own somehow.
[91:20.92]Really?
[91:22.34]That's dumb, but alright.
[91:33.79]This game is fun.
[91:34.79]What a fucking fun game.
[91:36.01]Like, for real.
[91:42.50]Get this vehicle to the safe house.
[91:46.39]Okay, I got four... This is a long fucking... I gotta drive across the whole snake?
[92:05.41]Oh, boy.
[92:06.99]It's only 4,500 miles away.
[92:09.41]And I have 3 minutes and 55 seconds to do this.
[92:16.42]This ain't gonna happen.
[92:17.20]That's not even enough time to go across one zone.
[92:24.06]I'm already, like, almost done.
[92:25.54]It's already over.
[92:30.63]Look at all that fucking scrumptious fucking crunchberries over there.
[92:32.97]God damn it.
[92:33.45]We gotta go.
[92:36.08]Look how much further I have to go.
[92:39.58]I'm not even going to come close.
[92:45.18]Is it like a shortcut I can take?
[92:47.22]I don't think so.
[92:55.23]This is going to be so close.
[92:56.95]Just judging by minutes and thousands of feet.
[92:59.75]I have to get this down to 3,006.
[93:00.83]You know what I mean?
[93:03.23]We've got to go per second.
[93:06.11]I'm already behind.
[93:06.77]I gotta be at 2900 right now.
[93:17.85]Across the bridge.
[93:21.31]I didn't unlock fast travel, by the way.
[93:23.86]This is controlled by the EDF.
[93:26.90]Really?
[93:27.24]My fucking tire went through.
[93:29.38]My fucking tire went through the goddamn ground.
[93:43.09]What kind of a bridge do you have where somebody can drive across it and their wheel can go through it?
[93:48.24]Oh, nice spin out.
[93:49.34]It's over.
[93:50.04]I have to be going way faster than this.
[93:58.81]God damn it.
[93:59.49]There's no way.
[94:01.07]I have to drive through this?
[94:05.98]I'm already at half health.
[94:11.21]I better get a lot of money for this.
[94:21.15]I don't know if I'm going to do it.
[94:21.93]It's going to be real close.
[94:27.99]You can't.
[94:28.41]And you might blow the bridge.
[94:29.42]Not now.
[94:30.68]We've got way more important things going on.
[94:39.14]Getting close.
[94:42.02]The math says I don't make it.
[94:43.60]Yeah, I know.
[94:44.46]But we have to go against all the math odds.
[94:50.29]And the fucking bridge is gone.
[94:52.35]Of course it is.
[94:53.71]Of course the bridge is gone.
[94:55.37]It keeps everything that's destroyed, destroyed.
[94:57.60]I shouldn't be complaining about that.
[94:58.84]I should be happy, because that's really cool.
[95:00.80]That when you destroy something, it stays destroyed.
[95:03.28]But I'm upset about it now, because I couldn't drive over it.
[95:16.68]This is too intense for me right now.
[95:20.16]Propaganda.
[95:20.82]Forget about the propaganda.
[95:21.88]I don't care.
[95:22.76]It's staying up.
[95:26.34]40 seconds.
[95:34.17]No, come on.
[95:36.09]I'm gonna fucking choke so bad.
[95:39.41]I'm going to choke this.
[95:42.89]Get out of the way, please.
[95:47.24]No, come on.
[95:48.22]I gotta stay on the road.
[95:51.72]Of course, you fucking garbage trucks.
[95:53.50]Get out of the way.
[95:54.28]300 feet.
[95:57.45]They don't give you much time to work with, do they?
[96:00.01]Ah!
[96:03.83]Come on!
[96:05.09]It's not gonna happen!
[96:05.91]It's not gonna happen!
[96:17.42]Dude, one bump.
[96:18.32]Time matters.
[96:36.80]Like, I can't waste one second.
[96:51.25]Alright, I'm doing alright.
[96:59.19]Put on some music.
[97:00.07]No, I'm just trying.
[97:00.78]We're just going straight.
[97:04.40]I'm gonna make it this time.
[97:07.18]Going over like a little too many bumps.
[97:08.92]I've already fucked it up.
[97:10.28]No, I haven't.
[97:10.82]Don't say that.
[97:22.27]I'm just like panicking right now.
[97:26.71]Don't have to go on the road.
[97:27.55]Just go here.
[97:28.86]Straight line.
[97:31.26]Seconds wasted.
[97:31.96]It's alright.
[97:32.50]Don't worry.
[97:33.04]We're gonna be fine.
[97:33.66]Guys, remember I got fucked up here because I had to do this big turn?
[97:39.16]I'm not gonna get fucked up again.
[97:42.80]No, we've already done it.
[97:43.83]I've already made back the seconds that I lost last time.
[97:46.17]I lost like four or five seconds there.
[97:49.49]If there was splits on the screen, I'd be doing fine.
[97:56.39]Get out of the fucking way.
[97:59.09]I definitely have it this time.
[98:01.39]As long as I don't do anything bogus.
[98:03.37]Like, we're talking real bogus.
[98:05.03]Then I should be good.
[98:13.98]Here comes the bridge.
[98:14.68]Yeah.
[98:16.86]We're gonna be fine.
[98:17.66]As long as I don't do anything dumb.
[98:21.92]That's dumb.
[98:22.46]That's dumb.
[98:23.92]That was a dumb thing I did.
[98:25.00]And I'm, like, spinning out.
[98:29.28]Here he comes again.
[98:32.23]Go.
[98:33.91]I'm already made up for at least 10 seconds.
[98:41.33]I hit that guy apparently.
[98:42.27]Apparently my tire bumped into that guy.
[98:45.41]Don't ask me how.
[98:46.11]This better be worth it.
[98:53.87]I better get like a new weapon for this.
[99:03.17]Bridge.
[99:03.59]No, didn't we already go past the bridge?
[99:12.76]Or is it right up here?
[99:17.58]How is it my... I was talking and I forgot.
[99:21.11]Sorry.
[99:21.79]We already made up the time.
[99:24.43]I was fucking talking and I forgot that this bridge... Oh, no.
[99:27.19]Oh.
[99:29.47]Get out of the way, you perfectly placed scripted fucking enemy.
[99:33.03]I gotta weave in and out of this traffic now.
[99:41.98]This is gonna be close again.
[99:45.28]There's way more fire trucks on the road.
[99:46.82]Get off the road, people.
[99:48.36]Please.
[99:51.28]We're good.
[99:54.60]Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
[99:55.44]We got it.
[99:57.18]Just don't fly off a cliff or anything.
[99:58.88]Don't drive into somebody.
[99:59.90]I'm so paranoid.
[100:07.53]Are there way more cars on this road or am I crazy?
[100:13.86]Tell me I'm crazy.
[100:14.48]There are way more cars on the road.
[100:20.34]They know what I'm trying to do.
[100:27.28]It's right up here.
[100:28.64]Okay, we made it.
[100:33.57]Get over there!
[100:35.31]Get over there!
[100:36.55]Get over there!
[100:38.90]I'm in!
[100:52.87]Oh my fucking chest that actually I actually got scared that was like a horror movie What did I get for doing that absolutely fucking nothing well glad it was worth it Dude even when I was inside it was not I was still counting down to one oh My whole body hurts alright, we're good Do I have enough scrap to fast travel because I'm gonna need to oh
[101:21.75]Alright, we got fast travel.
[101:29.93]Gorilla Express.
[101:30.73]There it is.
[101:33.89]So, how do I do this now?
[101:34.65]I think I can do it as click on it or what?
[101:49.26]Press V to go to safe house.
[101:52.50]Yeah, let's go there.
[101:53.08]Alright, press V. V. Press V to go to the safe house.
[102:01.65]Press V. Press V to go to safe house.
[102:17.69]V still doesn't work.
[102:20.92]It's Y. Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[102:25.78]You tell me that's a fucking Y. That's a Y, guys?
[102:32.56]Huh?
[102:34.30]That's a V. What kind of command is Y that's never bound to anything?
[102:52.71]Let's see.
[102:53.17]Oh, yeah.
[102:53.57]I'm such an idiot.
[102:54.19]Would an idiot do this?
[103:05.66]You guys should have seen the end of the stream last time.
[103:10.50]Alright.
[103:10.80]Let's... We did that one already.
[103:13.36]I want to do that again.
[103:14.72]Fireworks mission?
[103:17.48]Earn salvage and take your destruction skills to the next level.
[103:19.50]Yeah, let's do this one.
[103:22.85]Holy shit, the streamer's brain is so big.
[103:25.71]Thank you.
[103:26.15]Appreciate that, dude.
[103:29.53]Thank you.
[103:30.03]Appreciate that one, dude.
[103:32.85]Mm-hmm.
[103:38.21]Shortcut.
[103:42.00]There's lots of ore up here.
[103:43.16]I'm gonna get it.
[103:44.14]Because we get the ore on this stream.
[103:47.80]You might watch a stream sometimes where they skip all this shit.
[103:50.68]Not me.
[103:52.11]I'm a completionist.
[103:53.51]When I start something, I fucking finish it.
[103:56.71]Except for half the games I've ever played on this stream, the book I said I was gonna write, and countless other things I've ever told you.
[104:06.36]I fucking complete things on stream.
[104:15.04]I beat Red Dead.
[104:18.86]Okay, look, I know I'm scatterbrained, and I know I sometimes don't complete shit that I start, you know, whatever.
[104:25.98]But, like, come on, the last, like, month of this stream, you gotta give me at least, like, a shred of credit here.
[104:33.31]We beat all of Red Dead Redemption and the DLC, we beat Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and we're gonna beat this game.
[104:40.03]That's three games.
[104:41.81]That's three games in three months.
[104:46.82]It's one game per month that we complete.
[104:53.52]Fell down.
[104:54.12]Maybe I should do that one.
[105:00.37]No, I'm too busy mining.
[105:01.63]I don't care about anything else.
[105:06.05]What a great accomplishment.
[105:07.35]Three games in two years.
[105:08.53]Book writing stream.
[105:13.11]Well, thank you, Podgefest.
[105:15.32]One more.
[105:19.23]There's one on the ground over there, but I'm getting sucked into this ore thing, aren't I?
[105:22.67]Just don't want him to roll off the cliff.
[105:32.07]I just keep getting sucked in every time.
[105:33.59]There's another two.
[105:34.83]I'm going to have to leave it.
[105:44.36]Where is this?
[105:44.96]Hmm.
[105:52.97]Let's do that.
[105:53.55]It's right here.
[105:55.79]Might as well.
[105:56.83]And I can get the ore.
[106:00.39]You know, I did beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[106:02.75]You are talking about something that I did do.
[106:08.88]And... We could talk about that until I'm blue in the face.
[106:14.24]We don't have to, though.
[106:20.76]What's going on with the music?
[106:21.66]What do you mean, what's happening with the music?
[106:23.46]The music's freaking out?
[106:26.85]What about Wirehead?
[106:27.75]You know what?
[106:28.53]That's true.
[106:29.27]Did beat Wirehead on stream as well.
[106:34.23]I've been completing things recently.
[106:35.63]Look, I take what you guys have to say.
[106:42.09]Obviously, this stream, like... I've heard the feedback.
[106:48.84]I've heard it.
[106:49.82]And I'm gonna fucking deliver.
[106:52.88]Sometimes we're gonna like pick a game that I'm having fun with and I'm gonna beat it.
[106:56.11]And sometimes I'm gonna play like fucking 16 SEGA CD games in a row and fucking burn the fucking console.
[107:02.95]That's gonna happen.
[107:04.55]Sometimes.
[107:04.91]Alright, use the building to use your... Okay, find the weakness to bring it down.
[107:12.56]Okay, whatever.
[107:13.32]We have a minute to bring the whole thing down.
[107:14.50]Let's go.
[107:14.80]I have one charge.
[107:19.52]What?
[107:22.98]One charge.
[107:28.40]Okay, well that didn't work.
[107:31.76]Apparently that wasn't the weak point.
[107:33.40]This is gonna fall on me.
[107:44.95]What is holding you up still?
[107:45.77]This thing?
[107:50.15]Watch out for the sarcophagus in here.
[107:51.51]What is still holding this thing in the... What is holding you in the air?
[107:59.59]What is still holding this building up?
[108:01.83]This one wall?
[108:02.71]Okay, that almost killed me.
[108:18.46]Alright, well, the goal was a minute.
[108:20.82]Pro was 15 seconds.
[108:22.16]Okay, what did I get for that?
[108:23.38]I got 75 salvage.
[108:25.20]Okay.
[108:28.49]I can do better than that.
[108:32.19]I can do better than that.
[108:33.01]We're gonna go and get... Ready?
[108:33.75]Here we go.
[108:39.15]Just gotta go around and get all the fucking supports.
[108:40.83]It's almost done.
[108:53.07]That's it, right?
[108:53.55]And then the middle.
[109:02.10]Get down!
[109:03.20]Get it down!
[109:08.22]We got it.
[109:10.42]No, there's still one thing standing.
[109:11.92]Really?
[109:12.28]Like, it's dead.
[109:12.82]It's done.
[109:13.14]I did it.
[109:17.28]Whatever.
[109:21.76]I got the 75 Salvager doing it.
[109:23.22]That's all I care about.
[109:24.04]Let's fucking go.
[109:24.78]Let's move on to... I don't want to do this.
[109:32.31]We got a long... Let's destroy some shit.
[109:34.49]Because, I mean, I have... Oh, boy.
[109:36.29]Okay, let's cause some problems here.
[109:43.37]Let's try the nano gun out.
[109:45.70]I have the thing carrying around for a reason, right?
[110:07.54]Every bone in my body would break Honestly every single bone in my body would explode My all your bones would be dust And your skull would pop off like a dandelion
[110:26.83]Well, these have machine guns.
[110:27.79]Cool.
[110:31.61]Yeah, too bad I didn't stick the landing.
[110:34.85]I'm only gonna get the silver at the Olympics.
[110:37.24]What is this?
[110:37.56]Alright, well, whatever it is, we're gonna do it because we're gonna get scrapped.
[110:46.82]Think inside the box and then bust your way out.
[110:49.28]Destroy the building using... I don't know what that is.
[110:54.20]I don't know what these are.
[110:54.94]Okay, here's...
[110:57.40]Okay, these are like... I don't know what these are.
[111:02.55]Are these like proximity mines?
[111:14.04]I guess.
[111:14.50]I have no idea.
[111:15.44]What are... I don't know.
[111:34.28]How do you blow these up?
[111:39.72]I don't know what these are.
[111:46.31]Do I have to make like a trail?
[111:47.31]I have no idea.
[111:52.74]Uh, well.
[111:54.60]Just punch it.
[112:00.39]So these are just things that can't be detonated.
[112:03.23]Well, how do I just lose?
[112:05.31]Yeah, okay, how do I?
[112:11.23]Yeah, let's go.
[112:17.32]So I just gotta make a trail.
[112:20.08]Make a chain, easy enough.
[112:22.10]Oh, I already got some help, so that's good.
[112:23.44]Let's go here.
[112:23.98]I'm gonna do just like a pyrotechnic person.
[112:35.80]This way.
[112:36.24]I'm putting these kind of close next to each other.
[112:39.46]Then we're going to watch the whole thing explode.
[112:43.56]It's going to be so cool.
[112:50.24]Eight more.
[112:50.70]I got any more I want to do?
[113:02.01]Whatever.
[113:02.59]Okay, here we go.
[113:03.47]Let's just see how this works.

[113:43.79]Five seconds from pro.
[113:46.43]That's how we do it.
[113:51.60]We go on a grind.
[113:58.80]Let's destroy everything here.
[113:59.88]Let's use our nano rifle.
[114:01.74]Here we go.
[114:02.18]Okay.
[114:03.12]Let's try and get rid of this shit without being seen.
[114:15.38]It's the first swear I've heard all game.
[114:18.63]Can I be real?
[114:19.35]That guy just said the F word.

[115:08.89]And see you next time.
[115:11.17]Well, not quite.
[115:14.05]These things are always so hard to destroy.
[115:15.57]They really are.
[115:16.23]These are like the hardest buildings to break.
[115:23.24]Like, I can take out an entire complex faster than I can this little pillbox.
[115:37.85]That's a scrap.
[115:38.55]Alright, let's start shooting some dudes.
[115:50.26]Okay, well, that's...
[115:58.74]Where am I getting shot from?

[117:08.20]What is holding you up?
[117:09.19]The ladder?
[117:09.65]Is the ladder actually holding you up?
[117:11.95]It was.
[117:12.41]The ladder was holding it up.
[117:17.41]Get out of the way.
[117:22.66]Pretty sick roll, but it didn't help you.
[117:23.88]Okay, we're good.
[117:25.28]We got a lot of stuff to destroy here, though.
[117:27.14]Let's go with in the corners.
[117:36.01]That'll blow that.
[117:38.45]Every inch.
[117:39.93]One in the middle.
[117:41.63]One right there.
[117:43.11]And a yoink-a-yoink.

[118:26.69]There is something in the air.
[118:27.61]Nano gun!
[118:30.44]I got it.
[118:30.70]Did I disintegrate the wheel?
[118:33.54]How do I get rid of that?
[118:37.52]I'm being chased by a Call of Duty fucking killstreak weapon.
[118:44.06]That's not doing anything.
[118:44.78]Are you serious?
[118:49.68]Okay, bye.
[119:02.35]Keep going.
[119:05.70]Killing spree.
[119:06.48]Give me your weapon.
[119:07.08]I don't know what you had there, but it looked pretty good.
[119:13.44]Same deal.
[119:13.94]I don't have... Alright, we're good.
[119:21.66]Is there another... Is this like GTA?
[119:22.93]Do they just keep coming back?
[119:24.25]Of course they do.
[119:30.43]Get me out.
[119:30.81]Wait, what is that?
[119:32.41]Can I open this?
[119:33.23]No.
[119:35.85]Get out of the building.
[119:45.56]At least that thing just... I guess I get to... It's like a Lego.
[119:54.42]Lots of people coming over here like a way too many for me to handle And this fucking the stupid hind is shooting at me.
[120:03.08]Oh My god, I'm stuck I'm stuck in here Get this bed away from me I Can't move it's too much debris.
[120:19.23]Oh

[120:22.87]They're all coming this way.
[120:29.75]Come on!
[120:30.53]Get it!
[120:31.37]Get that support!
[120:32.99]Get the support beam!
[120:38.61]Almost done.
[120:40.87]Ooh!
[120:43.89]Holy shit!
[120:47.42]Get out of the way.
[120:48.40]Move!
[120:50.54]I'm such a rat.
[120:53.81]It's such a mole thing to do.
[120:55.21]I love it.
[121:02.93]9%.
[121:02.95]6%.
[121:04.85]Get the fuck down!
[121:08.39]It's done.
[121:08.73]Holy goodness gracious.
[121:11.63]Move.
[121:19.62]He threw a grenade.
[121:27.29]I gotta keep moving.
[121:29.93]Through here.
[121:31.13]I gotta get rid of that stupid helicopter.
[121:33.47]I gotta, like, melt its wings.
[121:35.77]Whatever the hell I need to do.
[121:39.27]Suck that guy up into oblivion.
[121:43.01]Where's he at?
[121:43.55]Right here?
[121:47.23]Come on, get it!
[121:48.39]Go down, go down, please!
[121:51.97]Got it.
[121:53.53]It's kind of a delayed reaction for that thing to die.
[121:56.02]Alright, I can move.
[122:02.48]Oh wow, I just crushed that dude.
[122:03.86]Alright, let's keep going.
[122:05.80]I need to get a car.
[122:09.85]We got one more thing up here.
[122:10.75]Alright, there's a safe over there that I can replenish.
[122:17.36]Pick up all the scrap.
[122:18.20]There's nothing in here.
[122:18.98]There's another helicopter.
[122:22.66]Are you serious?
[122:26.84]Why is there another helicopter?
[122:28.10]Already.
[122:36.30]Bring it down.
[122:36.74]Come on.
[122:41.48]Bring it down.
[122:42.40]That's it.
[122:42.78]Bring it down.
[122:49.64]It's still up.
[122:59.34]Get out of here.
[123:02.67]Take it down.
[123:04.51]Take it down.
[123:06.89]It's down.
[123:07.67]Okay.
[123:09.13]Now run like the wind.
[123:11.41]I can't stick around here.
[123:12.65]I'm running into enemy territory.
[123:13.79]This is bad news.
[123:24.60]Because that thing is very useful, actually.
[123:26.02]Here comes another GTA helicopter.
[123:37.25]Like, is that... There's no animation to tell if that's, like, happening or not.
[123:40.71]It's weird, right?
[123:41.75]I feel like I don't want to shoot it to... Well, now I have to.
[123:47.63]Because, like, I'm going to lose.
[123:49.61]Like, I don't even... I'm dead, apparently.
[123:51.41]Like, how do you even indicate what you're even deleting?
[123:55.05]How many times do I have to shoot that?
[123:55.93]It doesn't... Do I have to shoot it four times?
[123:57.99]Like, it doesn't matter.
[123:58.59]Like, what?
[124:04.16]I guess you just have to shoot it four times.
[124:11.06]If I hit a wing, it'll crash in one hit.
[124:13.16]I didn't hit the wing one time there?
[124:16.83]I think it's just three shots every time.
[124:18.07]Well, whatever.
[124:20.25]Whatever.
[124:25.58]I want to change some of these weapons, though.
[124:32.04]Let's go in here.
[124:36.39]Am I stoned?
[124:37.77]No.
[124:45.23]I guess this is okay.
[124:46.31]It's not like I don't want it.
[124:47.43]It's four shots.
[124:49.92]I just want to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong.
[124:51.98]That's why I was hesitant.
[124:56.34]I think I want... Alright, we got the grinder.
[124:58.80]Is this thing... What is this thing?
[125:02.27]Hey, thank you, James.
[125:03.99]Derm of the skilled demolition man.
[125:05.19]Thanks for the bits.
[125:06.03]Thank you, King of Whales also.
[125:07.31]Use the nano gun.
[125:10.07]Hey, Magpie.
[125:11.73]Thank you for the $10.
[125:12.69]Say hi, Alex.
[125:15.19]What's going on, Alex?
[125:16.65]How you doing?
[125:19.13]Thank you, Magpie, for the $10.
[125:19.91]$10.01. $10.01.
[125:23.68]Harmony Accord, thank you for the $8.
[125:26.19]I literally have barrels, Jeremy.
[125:27.81]Barrels and tubs full of this horse pudding.
[125:30.53]If it's not you sending all this, then who is it?
[125:32.21]It's me.
[125:33.27]It's been me the whole fucking time.
[125:35.47]I've been sending that to you.
[125:38.77]Every time.
[125:39.83]It's been me.
[125:41.51]But thank you, Harmony, for the $8.
[125:42.45]Appreciate it.
[125:45.56]Rascal, thank you for the $3.
[125:47.44]This is definitely one of the most fun games you've played on stream, at least to watch.
[125:52.62]Also, tip.
[125:53.70]If you see a gunship and have the nano rifle, try to shoot the front wings.
[125:56.82]It'll one-shot and crash.
[125:59.24]Really?
[126:00.87]Okay.
[126:01.55]Well, thanks a lot, Rascal.
[126:05.37]I would agree.
[126:05.73]I love this game.
[126:08.99]This game is a ton of fun.
[126:11.13]Nano Enhancer.
[126:13.83]Okay.
[126:15.10]Ammo.
[126:18.08]I think I kind of want six charges.
[126:22.38]I'm going to get this.
[126:30.74]Rocket ammo.
[126:32.54]Multi rockets.
[126:33.34]505.
[126:36.61]This thing's expensive.
[126:39.13]I'm going to hold on to this shit for now.
[126:43.79]Get the grinder.
[126:44.25]No, we're not going to use the grinder right now.
[126:46.07]Maybe in a little bit.
[126:52.73]Make our way over there.
[126:59.76]Nano rifle is a projectile.
[127:02.78]So yeah, it has travel time.
[127:08.62]Shortcut.
[127:21.46]Mm-hmm Wow, there's too many of these to not get them Right, I mean this is this so many of them I'm so addicted to collecting these it's unhealthy Swing around this way good parking.
[127:44.22]Hey, there's no there are no signs here.
[127:45.75]Oh
[127:47.08]I don't see any signs of where I can and can't park my vehicle.
[127:50.74]Do you?
[127:51.92]I don't.
[127:56.27]True Minecraft player.
[127:57.35]I know.
[127:58.61]Like, when I see obsidian, I'm gonna mine it.
[128:08.66]Press V to travel to save.
[128:10.52]Stop that.
[128:10.98]Hey, don't make fun of the streamer.
[128:16.76]Hey, respect the streamer.
[128:19.48]Nobody ever give me any criticism.
[128:24.16]You bow down to me.
[128:26.35]Respect the streamer.
[128:28.49]If I do something dumb, don't ever say it.
[128:32.59]Ever.
[128:39.37]I gotta get that last dongle.
[128:40.61]Come on.
[128:42.92]There it is.
[128:43.46]Fucking break the backboard just like Shaq.
[128:50.75]Where's my car?
[128:51.61]Oh, over here.
[128:54.63]You missed a tinted rock.
[129:05.49]Interesting way to get in the car, that's fine.
[129:09.45]Flying dongle smash.
[129:10.61]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[129:19.17]Into the wild.
[129:21.28]We go.
[129:25.24]Obsidian is the most worthless thing to mine.
[129:26.72]Just use buckets and it's faster.
[129:29.65]Hey, you can play your version of Minecraft.
[129:31.23]I can play mine.
[129:31.79]That's the beauty of Minecraft.
[129:33.47]There is no right and wrong way to play it.
[129:35.23]Just like eating a Reese's.
[129:38.11]There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[129:39.37]Remember those commercials where the guys would, like, eat the hole in the middle and, like, Count Dracula took, like, a bite out of the middle?
[129:43.51]There's no wrong way to play Minecraft.
[129:47.78]If I want to break it in half and, like, smear it on my butthole and then, like, feed it to my... I don't do those jokes.
[129:57.43]I don't know why I'm doing them.
[130:00.69]I don't do those jokes.
[130:03.81]I don't use, like, sexual humor, okay?
[130:06.07]We're not doing that.
[130:08.25]What are we, lowbrow?
[130:10.15]No.
[130:10.33]Alright, why are you in here?
[130:17.59]What the hell are you doing in here?
[130:18.61]There's no reason for you guys to be sitting in your cars in here.
[130:23.87]This is like a cool tank.
[130:27.24]Cool tank.
[130:28.42]Okay.
[130:29.64]Let's get this going.
[130:30.36]Move out of the way.
[130:40.17]That guy has... That guy got in the tank.
[130:43.75]He's shooting at me from the tank.
[130:45.29]From said tank.
[130:57.10]Why didn't I get the tank?
[131:00.71]Why didn't I just get the tank?
[131:02.61]Why did I bypass the tank?
[131:05.09]Is there a reason for that?
[131:07.25]Should I have like, what was the fucking point of that?
[131:13.10]Get in the tank!
[131:16.40]I didn't even know, I've never seen that vehicle before.
[131:18.28]How am I supposed to know that's what it does?
[131:25.06]Just smeared the receipt.
[131:28.97]And I'm going back there in this stupid little buggy.
[131:31.79]This is such a mistake.
[131:38.86]I did say it was a tank, but I was only saying that because my vocabulary is so limited that that could have been anything.
[131:48.72]I just say tank.
[131:49.88]I just say car.
[131:51.16]I just say plane.
[131:52.12]And I just say boat.
[131:53.92]I don't say, like, the V2 rocket tank.
[131:57.09]I don't say, like, the mammoth tank.
[131:58.49]I say, I just say the word.
[131:59.85]I say what it is.
[132:01.57]And I say how far away from it it is from my body.
[132:04.85]Tank, 40 feet.
[132:05.69]That's all I know how to do.
[132:08.92]Plane, 200 feet.
[132:20.22]Same.
[132:23.04]Okay, why am I going in here like this?
[132:25.03]No, see, the dumbest thing always works.
[132:27.87]Don't you guys know?
[132:30.59]The stupidest thing that I always end up doing is the one that ends up working.
[132:35.89]I'm going to blow up the guitar.
[132:36.87]Okay, I thought that was a person in my game in voice chat.
[132:40.87]Honestly.
[132:42.65]We'll get the guitar on the way out.
[132:54.95]Look at it.
[132:55.31]I'm dodging bullets left and right.
[132:56.61]Yeah, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got!
[133:03.05]Where's the tank?
[133:04.77]The tank's not even here anymore.
[133:06.81]Get out!
[133:11.77]Okay.
[133:12.83]Well, at least we made it over here.
[133:15.75]One, two, three, four.
[133:20.43]Let's just, I can't, that guy has one.
[133:22.99]I guess try to get it off him.
[133:36.75]Why don't you just pull it off?
[133:40.94]You can easily just peel it off.
[133:42.48]Just take off your armor.
[133:46.42]I can't take off my armor.
[133:47.67]I'll get in trouble.
[133:49.43]I might get fired.
[134:00.51]49%.
[134:00.55]Come on, get it down.
[134:02.53]I hate getting hit by you.
[134:04.65]See?
[134:05.01]That's what I'm talking about.
[134:06.19]That's the vocabulary we're working with right here.
[134:09.19]I hate getting hit by you.
[134:15.48]There's my getaway.
[134:16.06]Did I just blow my getaway car?
[134:17.58]Are you serious?
[134:22.84]Stop it.
[134:23.22]Get out of that animation.
[134:32.10]Melted.
[134:35.82]Alright, that's done.
[134:36.72]Keep moving.
[134:42.81]Okay, good.
[134:43.41]You're with me.
[134:43.79]Good.
[134:44.09]Let's go.
[134:45.99]Wrap around this way.
[134:46.61]We're gonna melt the buildings.
[134:47.59]We're gonna do tactical melting here, guys.
[134:53.51]I'm not gonna get spotted.
[134:54.31]I'm gonna melt all this shit tactically.
[134:57.97]Open.
[134:58.15]Open.
[135:00.11]You're in the way.
[135:00.67]You're in the way of the animation.
[135:01.63]Please move.
[135:05.82]So, I need to get rid of that.
[135:09.34]See ya.
[135:12.82]I'm gonna very... Holy shit, that almost just killed me.
[135:15.72]From that far away.
[135:18.00]That's... I would've been shocked if that happened.
[135:19.82]Okay, so we got this.
[135:21.61]Just start deleting the whole building.
[135:22.57]Go!
[135:25.67]And get rid of this.
[135:38.37]Okay, we're out of ammo for that one.
[135:39.85]That's fine.
[135:40.29]Alright, we're getting surrounded.
[135:50.16]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[135:50.86]Give me the scrap.
[135:57.53]Spam the million dollar tech gun.
[135:59.65]Well, yeah.
[136:00.41]I mean, come on.
[136:01.43]We're at war right now, guys.
[136:05.83]We're at war.
[136:07.80]What would you have me do?
[136:09.20]Not utilize it?
[136:14.86]Alright, just get in here.
[136:15.72]Got the scrap.
[136:21.93]Get in here.
[136:26.43]Anything in here that I need to get?
[136:30.28]Oh, shithead.
[136:32.36]Okay, I don't...
[136:35.76]Fuck it.
[136:36.14]Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[136:43.11]So many people.
[136:46.33]I'm fucking surrounded.
[136:47.35]I'm gonna die.
[136:49.49]I'm gonna die.
[137:10.11]I'm just mowing people down.
[137:11.51]This is insanity.
[137:19.61]Come on, take out the supports.
[137:23.11]Whoa, it's already dead!
[137:24.87]No!
[137:25.78]What, it has like 50% left?
[137:27.28]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[137:28.96]Wow.
[137:30.02]I must have hit the right fucking thing.
[137:35.10]Get out.
[137:36.76]Get out.
[137:38.56]Get out.
[137:43.19]Wow.
[137:46.28]I must have hit the right thing.
[137:47.68]Holy crap.
[137:53.56]Stop killing the gorillas.
[137:54.92]Well, I can't help it.
[137:55.62]Why are they standing in the buildings?
[137:59.20]That had like 50% left.
[138:00.40]I'm surprised that actually worked.
[138:10.56]God.
[138:11.13]Here they are.
[138:11.49]Okay, good.
[138:11.85]We have friends.
[138:12.55]Do we have any bullets left in any gun?
[138:15.37]I got bullets in this.
[138:16.23]Okay, we have to be tactical about this.
[138:18.57]Last building over here.
[138:19.47]We gotta ram it.
[138:28.43]Well, I had that idea, and apparently you did too.
[138:30.96]And now I can't break this because I'm not going fast enough.
[138:33.12]Get away from the car.
[138:34.98]You fucking idiot.
[138:35.86]Like, honestly, why are you doing that?
[138:37.04]Get out of my way.
[138:40.67]This is not working as intended, so we're going to back it up again.
[138:44.24]And I might just have to leave.
[138:45.24]Okay, I'm running over plenty of friends.
[138:48.70]Go fast!
[138:52.10]It's not working.
[138:56.42]Come on.
[139:01.47]Come on.
[139:02.73]Come on.
[139:03.35]Oh, come on.
[139:07.47]Come on.
[139:09.13]It's a lost cause.
[139:09.79]This is like a thousand people there.
[139:25.72]Why you... Get... Get out of the way.
[139:38.34]God.
[139:39.24]Go.
[139:40.20]Get out of here.
[139:41.60]Get out.
[139:42.54]Fuck it.
[139:42.98]I can't do it.
[139:50.19]God damn it.
[139:51.13]Hold on.
[139:51.49]I'm not going to let it win.
[139:56.29]I can't let it beat me.
[140:04.04]Shit.
[140:04.28]I was trying to do something cool.
[140:19.53]Get out of the car.
[140:21.51]Get out of the fucking car.
[140:22.19]Get out.
[140:26.97]This guy's still up here.
[140:28.53]Is that guy gonna shoot for my... Is that guy gonna shoot the gun?
[140:32.28]I don't know if this guy's still alive.
[140:34.78]He may... He might be alive.
[140:38.34]I think he... No, I don't know.
[140:39.50]I think he might be dead.
[140:40.98]It's possible.
[140:41.72]It's possible he's still among the living.
[140:57.54]Die!
[140:59.14]Come down!
[140:59.86]These support structures are so hard to destroy.
[141:03.30]Well, you know what?
[141:03.76]Fine.
[141:03.92]Here's what we're gonna do.
[141:07.16]I'll make my own, like, bomb.
[141:14.31]Watch this.
[141:19.69]I'll make my own fucking bomb.
[141:26.48]Yep.
[141:32.98]Give me the scrap.
[141:40.08]Shit.
[141:40.44]Gimme.
[141:45.45]Got it.
[141:46.13]Cool.
[141:46.69]Nice.
[141:50.91]There's a guy in here.
[142:06.20]What is this?
[142:07.80]Drive the vehicle to the safe house.
[142:14.18]I can't even move the vehicle.
[142:17.40]I fucking wedged in.
[142:18.84]I wedged in.
[142:23.26]Get the vehicle to the safe house.
[142:24.70]Sure thing.
[142:30.61]Don't think that's gonna end up hap- no, uh, sorry, uh, not gonna happen, that's- we have to get out now.
[142:41.25]Okay, that's fine.
[142:43.19]Like, whatever.
[142:48.45]What happened?
[142:48.91]He did escape and exploded, okay.
[143:05.11]I failed the mission to escape and then my guy exploded.
[143:07.45]Oh well.
[143:10.11]Well, we destroyed plenty of stuff.
[143:13.20]So everything's fine.
[143:13.88]Actually, I'm glad I'm here.
[143:14.70]Wait, I blew the barrel up?
[143:24.25]Is that what happened?
[143:27.03]I blew the barrel up with my hammer?
[143:30.39]I've been trying this for an hour.
[143:31.71]Wait, what?
[143:33.23]I have not.
[143:35.61]There were like 15 of those blue things to destroy.
[143:45.11]Trying.
[143:45.51]We've been succeeding.
[143:46.47]I've been destroying them.
[143:49.29]The guy shot a barrel next to me.
[143:51.26]Of course he did.
[143:55.88]Let's go do a mission.
[144:01.88]So, yeah.
[144:02.24]We have been succeeding.
[144:06.58]Thank you, King of Wales, for the ten bucks.
[144:12.65]Sorry.
[144:13.83]Thank you, King of Wales, for the ten bucks.
[144:15.45]Buying bits is so much faster than watching ads.
[144:19.37]Thanks for the years of entertainment.
[144:20.45]Keep doing what you're doing.
[144:21.11]All money goes to the BF Fund.
[144:23.13]And it was not a tank.
[144:25.23]It wasn't a tank, okay.
[144:27.13]Well, thank you, King of Wales, for the ten bucks.
[144:28.68]Appreciate it.
[144:30.10]And then thank you, Purple.
[144:32.38]Only mentioning this because I know you'd love them, but in the back room of that gas station place opposite the pumps, there are rare super bombs that you can find in the wild.
[144:39.33]Really.
[144:41.07]Huh.
[144:43.65]That's interesting.
[144:44.27]Let's do this.
[144:51.15]Mm-hmm.
[144:52.09]Mission time.
[144:54.48]It's swirly bombs.
[144:55.30]Wild super bombs.
[144:56.08]Escort mission.
[144:57.52]Uh... Okay.
[144:57.76]Okay.
[145:25.91]Alright, right here.
[145:26.77]It's a good thing I've actually gotten rid of most of this stuff.
[145:33.41]Am I ever going to learn that it's hard to get in a car like this?
[145:38.85]I don't think I'll ever learn that.
[145:45.24]Into the free fire zone for a joke?
[145:50.28]Don't... I don't think so.
[145:52.68]We're too busy.
[145:58.86]We have to infiltrate a base and smuggle somebody out.
[146:03.11]Sorry, you had to dive out of the way, guys.
[146:10.49]Oh, no.
[146:13.37]I got a guy in the back now, and if that guy dies, then it's probably going to end the mission.
[146:21.16]So I have to be very careful with this dude in the back.
[146:24.38]Okay.
[146:28.70]Like, why?
[146:29.22]What is this?
[146:29.90]Why are you in the back, dude?
[146:32.81]Why are there stormtroopers now?
[146:34.01]Like, can you shoot them or something?
[146:39.59]This guy's real useless in the back here.
[146:43.90]Alright, cool.
[146:46.80]Thanks, man.
[146:47.24]Thanks for just holding on like it was a ride.
[147:00.32]Kill the vehicle guards before your car explodes.
[147:03.26]Because if I get out, I'm going to die.
[147:06.53]The car is going to explode.
[147:07.95]And this guy is dead.
[147:09.05]So we have to get everyone out.
[147:10.73]Everyone out.
[147:16.33]I hope none of my friends died.
[147:18.48]Okay, none of my friends died.
[147:24.50]Holy shit.
[147:31.79]We did it.
[147:32.29]Nice work.
[147:35.81]You guys sure do know how to shoot people.
[147:38.01]Make sure you don't miss any scrap.
[147:45.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[147:48.33]What happened?
[147:48.83]What are you doing?
[147:50.91]A certain person screamed and the car exploded.
[147:54.05]What are you doing?
[148:09.60]Protect the vehicle Okay this travel time I got a compensate for the travel time I'm gonna shoot the flying whales I
[148:24.63]There's a guy that we captured?
[148:29.97]What?
[148:30.85]Okay, well, you get out of the way.
[148:34.15]Look at all these.
[148:35.97]There's so many of them.
[148:36.97]We'll wait till they get...
[148:53.40]What happened?
[148:53.86]Did somebody- I said that- Oh my fucking lord.
[148:58.76]Oh shit!
[149:04.75]This guy's getting shot.
[149:09.03]Got it!
[149:09.49]Got the double tap.
[149:11.39]This guy keeps getting hit with bullets.
[149:15.23]He's going like- Oh my god.
[149:24.37]Why are we in the Free Fire Zone?
[149:25.91]First hit.
[149:26.57]Come on, hit it.
[149:27.68]Get it!
[149:44.10]I can't even... It's the firing data!
[149:48.20]I don't know who... Why is he screaming?
[149:52.84]What if I just got off?
[150:13.42]Bye.
[150:21.72]Goodbye.
[150:24.25]What is that?
[150:25.55]That's the moon, okay.
[150:32.65]Why are you going this way?
[150:35.97]This is not a safe way to go.
[150:41.13]Stop spinning me around.
[150:43.97]Stop spinning around.
[150:44.99]Drive in a straight line.
[150:46.53]Oh, it's so hard to aim up there.
[150:54.71]Ow.
[150:57.01]Ow.
[150:58.22]Where is it?
[151:01.92]Come on.
[151:02.52]Don't lose this.
[151:03.66]Don't lose.
[151:04.20]I don't want to do this shit again.
[151:10.54]Any more planes?
[151:13.82]Alright, we're good.
[151:23.24]One more ship.
[151:25.48]I think I got it.
[151:29.61]Did I get it?
[151:30.35]I'm pretty sure I did.
[151:33.93]Nope.
[151:34.73]Okay, there's a fucking hundred here now.
[151:40.70]She just used a Joker line.
[151:44.78]Jesus Christ!
[151:53.55]There's nobody even around.
[151:57.07]They're so far away, it's hard to even shoot them.
[151:58.71]Alright, he's gonna drive it.
[152:07.69]Wait, why?
[152:08.73]What was that?
[152:09.59]Why did we do that?
[152:10.55]Wait, everyone's just crouching.
[152:16.73]Hey!
[152:17.85]Holy God, that was so close.
[152:39.32]That was so close.
[152:41.42]Are they still over here?
[152:44.88]If that ended the fucking mission, I would have fucking cried, man.
[152:47.53]They all went over the edge.
[152:52.21]Rate this game so far out of 10?
[152:57.79]Someone just said fucking Blues Brothers shit right there.
[153:00.28]Yeah, it really was.
[153:02.30]They weaved so perfectly around to not hit us.
[153:06.51]Oh my god, that would have been so funny.
[153:12.99]Uh, a 9.
[153:13.45]Can I currently give it a 9?
[153:20.25]Almost done with this area, too.
[153:23.13]Well, we're right next to it.
[153:23.98]Might as well go for it.
[153:25.62]I'm gonna say like a... Like a 9.
[153:28.14]Like a 9.2.
[153:28.34]9.2, for sure.
[153:36.30]It's just super fun, like, arcade-y, interesting, addicting game.
[153:44.41]My only complaints about this game, they've been pretty few and far between.
[153:47.43]But it's mostly been... Like, really, really trivial stuff that's not a big deal.
[154:00.68]I like, I wanna just... The car can't drive now, fine.
[154:09.65]It's too hard to kill these things.
[154:11.55]It's too hard.
[154:12.61]We're going to do the big one.
[154:14.57]Is that guy still under the car?
[154:23.34]We're going to blow the bridge.
[154:26.20]Easy.
[154:26.62]I have a weapon that lets me take it down.
[154:30.18]Right?
[154:48.98]Okay, well.
[154:50.44]Sorry.
[154:51.45]Sorry about that one.
[154:55.13]You could have just not driven in a straight line.
[155:01.39]Where's the... Okay, get rid of the supports.
[155:09.12]Wasted ammo.
[155:09.76]Alright.
[155:10.30]Well, how... Shit, how do I get across this?
[155:14.18]No, I gotta jump.
[155:18.14]Alright, I'm gonna... This is gonna be like a construction job.
[155:21.58]I just gotta go down here and slowly take it out one by one.
[155:29.35]Okay, hold on.
[155:31.03]Not exactly what I intended.
[155:32.41]A lot of scrap down here.
[155:35.39]Alright, here we go.
[155:39.96]I don't think I can do that.
[155:43.82]Whoa, here's the guy.
[155:47.15]He's alive.
[155:48.33]They're both alive.
[155:50.31]Nice job.
[155:55.89]Move.
[155:57.55]It's not safe down here.
[156:02.71]There's a guy in the back.
[156:07.52]Can't destroy the concrete on the bottom, oh well.
[156:15.93]So I can't do this yet.
[156:17.65]So we're going to do this.
[156:20.74]Heavy metal.
[156:21.14]Defend the area from incoming EDF troops.
[156:22.78]That's easy enough.
[156:23.58]You just have to shoot people.
[156:26.74]Come on.
[156:27.00]Do it.
[156:28.06]Come on.
[156:29.36]Punch it.
[156:29.70]You can get up there.
[156:32.88]I could just walk.
[156:35.59]But I'm currently...
[156:39.25]I currently just, I don't care.
[156:40.91]I need to get up here and just drive on the road.
[156:43.46]I'm way in, I'm in too deep.
[156:46.20]I could have been there by now.
[156:52.12]If I just walked.
[156:59.75]I don't think I was going to drive through.
[157:05.53]Everybody's going after me.
[157:08.59]Ah, too bad you guys are intelligent.
[157:11.93]If only you were not intelligent.
[157:16.67]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[157:22.07]Just walk, okay?
[157:27.34]Just fucking walk.
[157:28.72]Get me out of here.
[157:31.44]I can't walk up this.
[157:37.36]Oh, come on.
[157:38.80]Please, I just want to get up here.
[157:47.69]Get out of the car.
[157:50.75]You fucking asshole.
[157:54.27]Give me my car back.
[157:59.42]I fucking love this game.
[158:03.06]Alright, let's go.
[158:07.95]We have to turn around.
[158:08.81]We can't go over the bridge anymore.
[158:10.37]Oh, no.
[158:12.91]Out of here.
[158:20.97]It's right here.
[158:26.64]Oh, well, thank you for the tank.
[158:28.54]Holy... Oh, destroyed vehicles.
[158:30.28]Oh, this is... Yeah.
[158:31.78]Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[159:11.91]What?
[159:12.19]Oh no, the sto- I left the area.
[159:17.38]I wasn't in the zone?
[159:18.46]Okay.
[159:35.05]Well, that explains that, I guess.
[159:41.36]Just stay in the circle.
[159:45.84]Just wait for them to come to me, apparently.
[159:47.42]I guess.
[159:55.42]That wasn't even an EDF vehicle.
[160:05.46]Oh my god Um well this I gotta drive And the guy in front of me now sure It's two shots to blow a car up
[160:36.70]It's too much going on I can't even fucking tell I'm gonna like have to leave the circle Everything is so loud I gotta do this like another five minutes Okay
[161:06.38]I'll do my best.
[161:10.49]Oh my lord.
[161:11.93]I gotta go.
[161:15.53]We're gonna drive this way.
[161:16.43]There's way too many things.
[161:17.57]This is just total Armageddon.
[161:22.05]Do you guys know what direction I'm even facing anymore?
[161:27.49]I've lost track.
[161:32.72]I need to destroy ten more.
[161:43.68]Their whole army is going down.
[161:49.05]And now they have a big tank.
[161:50.19]That's not fair.
[161:52.25]What?
[161:55.43]Okay, well.
[161:56.67]Alright, easy.
[161:57.47]Easy.
[161:57.79]Don't fuck this up.
[161:58.89]This is too- We're too close to fucking have this end.
[162:01.91]So please don't do this.
[162:05.47]It's gonna explode.
[162:06.31]Come on, 33.
[162:16.41]Okay.
[162:20.41]Is this scrap?
[162:23.73]Or does the scrap all disappear?
[162:30.30]If I died on 34, I would have been very angry.
[162:35.78]I guess everything just disappears.
[162:38.38]That's kind of sad.
[162:42.51]Oh, well.
[162:43.95]Get in the garbage truck.
[162:49.54]What's next?
[162:50.60]22.
[162:51.14]I guess I could go... I could go up or down.
[162:54.32]Let's just... We're here.
[162:55.10]Let's clear this one and then... That should be enough to get to the... That's fucking loud.
[163:01.94]Destroy the crane.
[163:02.78]Alright, fine.
[163:06.34]I'll destroy the crane.
[163:07.30]If I don't... This is going to be one of those things where everyone's going to attempt to go back to the crane.
[163:10.74]So I'm going to make sure I destroy the crane.
[163:15.00]You guys know that for the rest of the stream, you guys will always say, Go back to Crane!
[163:20.36]Oh my god, not like this!
[163:21.70]Crane!
[163:23.23]There you are.
[163:25.05]Now you can't say it.
[163:25.73]I'm so glad I'm alive.
[163:41.74]Scrap.
[163:44.86]Alright, there you go.
[163:45.94]There's your crane.
[163:50.10]Michael, go back to the crane.
[163:51.48]Why no crane?
[163:52.44]I just destroyed the crane.
[163:55.28]Don't give me that.
[164:02.15]Thank you, rascal, for the two bucks.
[164:05.33]And they say... Shoot out the Y beams underneath the bridge with a nano rifle.
[164:10.77]Are you making like a Y joke?
[164:11.89]A V and Y joke?
[164:20.54]I got the other crane, too.
[164:21.52]Nobody freak out.
[164:24.72]I destroyed another crate.
[164:27.72]I gotta, like, be more on top of that, man.
[164:29.52]I don't think I've even collected one of those the entire time.
[164:39.64]Freaking out.
[164:47.25]Let's do it.
[164:50.76]Let me get in here and make sure there's nothing in here.
[164:53.24]There's nobody chasing me yet.
[164:54.34]Okay, is that a crate?
[164:57.71]It looks like a crate.
[164:58.57]These look like crates, right?
[165:01.33]It's a crate, right?
[165:05.43]No, those are just like random suitcases.
[165:10.17]Crates?
[165:11.11]What's that?
[165:13.40]What is this?
[165:17.26]Uh...
[165:21.84]Okay.
[165:24.14]It's some kind of, like, shell.
[165:25.52]How is fucking happening?
[165:29.93]What?
[165:34.27]It's a fucking time gun.
[165:37.27]Wait, what the fuck was that?
[165:43.37]I just made a black hole.
[165:47.41]I thought it was gonna be, like, an explosive device.
[165:52.98]Chaos is a ladder.
[165:58.56]No, no, I don't have it anymore.
[166:03.50]Oh, come on.
[166:04.56]Where was that?
[166:06.18]I don't think I can even get it.
[166:07.12]Fucking vacuum cleaner.
[166:15.47]How was I supposed to know that was a vacuum cleaner?
[166:20.09]Oh my lord.
[166:25.56]Is it on a timer?
[166:27.06]Or does it have to be interacted with?
[166:29.97]I've set the seven points left.
[166:31.59]Let's just go.
[166:32.03]I can't break the bridge.
[166:36.03]Actually, I can break the bridge.
[166:37.77]But we're not going to do that yet.
[166:40.33]I'm going to go do this.
[166:53.75]Didn't work that time.
[166:56.84]Didn't work that time.
[166:58.50]I jumped out of it before, and it didn't... It made it... You know... Remember when I did that before, and I was fine?
[167:06.96]Not gonna do it again.
[167:15.81]Buy upgrades?
[167:16.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[167:16.99]Not yet.
[167:19.03]We're gonna do this mission, and then... Before the next mission, I'm gonna buy an upgrade.
[167:24.75]Wait, I still have one of the black holes?
[167:27.25]Wait, really?
[167:28.33]So what, I can black hole the bridge then, right?
[167:29.78]Holy shit, that's what we're doing.
[167:38.77]Where do I need to- I- I- I- You guys still might have one black hole.
[167:45.77]Oh, damn it, I do have one.
[167:47.28]Okay.
[167:49.02]To the bridge.
[167:53.23]I don't know, guys.
[167:53.81]Don't you think it would be more interesting if I was being chased by like 100 people?
[167:57.43]And I went to that bridge and I dropped it in the middle of the bridge?
[168:02.14]Yeah.
[168:03.40]Sorry, guys.
[168:05.56]I'm sorry.
[168:07.44]We're holding on to that.
[168:08.30]And I'm going to get a bunch of people to chase me.
[168:11.92]And then we're going to drop them in the black hole.
[168:20.73]Get up.
[168:22.80]Get up.
[168:24.00]Get up.
[168:25.60]You can do it.
[168:26.96]You can get up.
[168:28.22]I know you can.
[168:31.16]It won't turn around.
[168:32.42]I'm just stuck like this.
[168:36.14]Jesus Christ.
[168:42.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[168:42.89]Can I spin it now?
[168:44.25]Wait, wait.
[168:44.71]Easy.
[168:45.15]Watch this.
[168:45.75]Can I... Couldn't I do that before?
[168:47.31]Remember?
[168:49.57]I, like, tapped it.
[168:53.94]You guys don't think I'm fucking smart.
[169:00.52]Riveting gameplay.
[169:08.16]No, we're not using a black hole.
[169:09.68]Why am I going this way?
[169:13.58]Black hole is when I get chased by like 20 cars.
[169:16.49]And it's dropping right in the middle of the bridge.
[169:20.35]I'm holding on to that one for a while.
[169:26.40]Suppressive V. We'll do this one.
[169:31.34]We'll move on.
[169:39.45]Hey, Jenkins.
[169:46.55]Meet me over there.
[169:48.18]There's a guy coming.
[169:54.64]Where is he?
[169:58.60]Is that him?
[170:01.42]Okay.
[170:02.38]Get on his... Is he dead?
[170:08.15]No, that guy is.
[170:09.27]The guy that we're currently... Whose head we're running over with our car.
[170:13.29]Cause millions of credits worth of destruction to EDF facilities.
[170:16.62]Key buildings will be highlighted.
[170:17.78]Killing colonists penalizes you.
[170:19.10]Be careful.
[170:23.20]Alright, cause millions of...
[170:27.30]Cause a million dollars in damage.
[170:29.36]Come on.
[170:39.60]Got it.
[170:45.12]I gotta do 500 million dollars worth of damage.
[170:47.06]It's not gonna work that easily here.
[170:53.88]Oh, come on.
[170:55.76]Stop panicking and do it.
[171:01.86]I'm just gonna kill these guys, seriously.
[171:03.38]Honest to god, these guys just die.
[171:04.94]Just give them the fucking damage they need.
[171:13.17]There it is, get it.
[171:14.85]Almost.
[171:17.17]Nobody driving this car.
[171:27.00]Ow.
[171:30.29]Probably shouldn't be shooting the things right next to me.
[171:31.97]That's a bad idea.
[171:36.21]Propaganda.
[171:36.77]Got it.
[171:41.33]Don't let them hit us.
[171:43.40]Well, it's kind of hard when you're trying to destroy buildings and shit, dude.
[171:45.84]45.
[171:48.56]Just need to get 55 million.
[172:01.06]51.
[172:07.46]52.
[172:10.02]God damn it, the light post got in the way.
[172:11.56]55.
[172:17.90]Come on, 54.
[172:18.98]Come on.
[172:20.96]Oh, no.
[172:22.42]Is that it?
[172:23.30]Nope, thank God.
[172:26.32]Got it.
[172:29.61]I did it.
[172:30.39]Thank God.
[172:30.81]That would have been really bad.
[172:38.91]That's the first thing I thought we were turning the corner and that was gonna be it.
[172:46.98]Are we done yet, man?
[172:59.05]Can you go back home, please?
[173:04.25]I'd like to go home now.
[173:06.49]I'd like to go fucking home, please.
[173:13.07]This thing's gonna explode if you don't take us home soon, my man.
[173:18.57]This guy's just talking.
[173:24.73]What's he saying?
[173:25.51]What the hell is he even saying?
[173:30.14]Alright, get us out of here.
[173:36.07]You don't understand the notion of urgency, man.
[173:39.19]We gotta leave.
[173:41.43]It's just driving us into walls.
[173:42.75]Oh.
[173:49.66]Aw.
[173:52.26]Got it.
[173:53.88]You gonna go over that?
[173:55.72]Nope.
[174:09.26]Get the fuck out of here.
[174:10.94]I'm done with this mission.
[174:12.04]I want to be just over with it.
[174:13.94]This car's gonna blow up.
[174:16.76]We've had so many opportunities to just leave and now the car is gonna like catch fire.
[174:25.87]Please don't do any more damage to this car.
[174:27.31]Alright, we did it.
[174:30.29]70 million.
[174:37.75]No colonists died?
[174:38.85]Minus 40, and there it is.
[174:58.34]No, that's so predictable.
[174:59.42]I'm not going to kill him.
[175:00.70]That is like the most predictable thing I could do.
[175:04.47]Alright.
[175:05.41]Safe house.
[175:06.71]We have zero now.
[175:07.49]We can do the next mission, which is over there.
[175:09.19]Just do singularity this guy.
[175:18.36]What does it say?
[175:18.80]We'll go to the safe house.
[175:19.72]Alright.
[175:22.60]V. V.
[175:28.04]No, I'm not going to do it.
[175:29.38]That's too easy.
[175:33.04]Up an oasis.
[175:33.64]What's this?
[175:36.58]House arrest.
[175:37.12]Rescue captured colonists.
[175:39.46]You guys know how well this goes every time we do it.
[175:44.23]But why not?
[175:44.89]I'll do my best.
[175:56.22]I do need to... replace something here.
[176:01.86]Singularity Bomb!
[176:02.72]Am I gonna have 10 of these?
[176:03.62]10 of- or is that- okay.
[176:07.76]Wait a minute.
[176:14.58]I guess a 10 out of 10.
[176:15.86]I'm confused here.
[176:20.37]Let's put this back.
[176:23.55]Mmm... No.
[176:29.41]I'm going to store this for now.
[176:30.66]I don't want it right now.
[176:34.40]Let's put that on two... Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
[176:39.20]Two, three, four.
[176:42.25]That's fine.
[176:45.29]Okay.
[176:47.41]I cannot store a Singularity Bomb.
[176:51.18]Oh, fuck.
[176:52.90]Are you serious?
[176:57.10]Alright.
[176:57.76]I can't store it.
[176:58.44]I have to use it somewhere then.
[177:02.60]Get rid of the assault rifle.
[177:03.48]But I feel like I use the assault rifle a lot and use it to kill people.
[177:13.15]Let's go rescue.
[177:17.33]Free the hostages who are over here.
[177:22.36]Hostage rescue.
[177:23.92]It's not going to go well.
[177:24.96]I can tell you that for sure.
[177:28.81]I can easily just go pick up another one.
[177:31.42]But I can't store them.
[177:35.26]Oh, no upgrades.
[177:37.00]I want to have like a thousand scrap before I upgrade anything.
[177:41.46]What is that futuristic car?
[177:44.16]That thing looks awesome.
[177:49.35]I like how the vehicles actually do change.
[177:52.55]They can go either way.
[177:57.25]Welcome to Oasis.
[178:03.16]60.
[178:03.32]Yeah, I didn't kill the crane.
[178:06.07]No more cranes.
[178:06.65]I'm not going to destroy another one ever again.
[178:10.27]I'm going to use this because the people can get in the back of this car.
[178:12.97]I assume.
[178:13.43]Okay, free the hostages.
[178:34.58]Sneak around the back.
[178:43.11]Sneak around this one, too.
[178:44.77]Oh, god.
[178:49.83]Why are they running?
[178:52.85]Alright, just crack through this giant candy bar.
[178:54.65]Okay, well, you know what?
[179:00.85]Fucking that's not gonna work.
[179:07.91]Can I get any upgrades for this thing?
[179:09.17]I feel like it would be way better if I could upgrade it.
[179:11.51]Actually, not that bad.
[179:21.40]As long as I'm not stupid.
[179:26.31]God damn it.
[179:26.81]I shot the guy right in the back.
[179:27.69]And there's a guy next to him.
[179:28.61]Where is he?
[179:38.91]Don't throw grenades in here.
[179:42.47]Oh, Lord.
[179:43.41]You got idiots throwing grenades.
[179:47.01]Like, how the fuck am I... When people are tossing grenades up here.
[179:51.19]I'm so... And then I get those people everywhere.
[179:57.96]For the love of God.
[179:59.94]I'm about to drop a singularity bomb over here.
[180:11.76]I would love to.
[180:12.38]Here's an entrance.
[180:27.36]Why am I playing this like Rainbow Six?
[180:40.38]I do pretty well in this game besides Rainbow Six.
[180:49.61]I wish I was this good at FPS games.
[180:51.99]I thought that was a hostage.
[180:53.11]It wasn't.
[180:53.45]Good.
[180:57.37]Oh, I could have accidentally killed all those people.
[180:59.41]Okay, here we go.
[180:59.87]There's one.
[181:03.29]Two is over here, right?
[181:04.31]Alright, where's three?
[181:10.44]Can I give these guys a gun?
[181:11.10]Where's the third guy?
[181:11.98]Oh, God.
[181:12.80]Where's the third one?
[181:14.76]There are three hostages up here.
[181:16.21]Where are you?
[181:20.55]What the hell are you doing?
[181:25.94]Where's this third hostage?
[181:38.41]Where are you?
[181:41.07]Oh my god, there he is.
[181:42.79]Alright, out!
[181:44.19]Out the back door!
[181:47.51]Come on!
[181:47.99]Let's go!
[181:49.89]Don't- Easy!
[181:50.45]Come on!
[181:51.43]Come on!
[181:53.23]You idiots!
[181:54.33]Go!
[181:55.73]Look!
[181:56.55]Out!
[181:57.17]Out!
[181:57.98]Out!
[181:58.40]Oh, you fucking idiots.
[182:00.10]Like, we have a back door.
[182:02.98]Unbelievable.
[182:03.78]Like, why are you running this way?
[182:05.32]Go out here!
[182:09.82]What are you doing?
[182:11.30]Oh my god.
[182:13.70]Oh my fucking god.
[182:15.22]We could just walk out the fucking back door.
[182:17.36]And he's gonna die.
[182:19.69]You've successfully got us killed because you won't follow me out the back door.
[182:24.27]Like, I don't know what the fuck I have to do to make you guys understand to like walk with me out the back.
[182:31.55]I'm not doing that again.
[182:34.84]I'm just dead.
[182:36.26]Fucking great.
[182:41.32]I've ran out the back door that I made and all of them, all their AI was like, oh, he went outside.
[182:46.96]We have to go through the front door and run around the circle.
[182:51.71]Jesus Christ.
[182:52.63]I'm not doing that again.
[182:54.95]Apparently their AI pathing doesn't know how to walk out that door.
[183:11.81]Let's go to the mission.
[183:12.65]It's right here.
[183:13.97]Let's do it.
[183:23.82]Thank you, Todd, for the five bucks.
[183:27.54]I have yet to see a single gorilla.
[183:30.94]They're everywhere.
[183:31.68]We're all gorillas.
[183:36.28]Thank you, though, Todd.
[183:41.99]I need to get one of those George Jetson cars.
[183:48.29]I honestly think those rescue the hostage missions are probably like the hardest missions to do in the game.
[183:57.36]Because you have to hope that the AI... Oh, yeah, go free four fucking people.
[184:01.32]Go free three people.
[184:03.40]Hope they're not as brainless as you think.
[184:05.32]And they are.
[184:05.76]Every time they are.
[184:06.46]Give me that fucking Jetson's car.
[184:15.27]Give me that car.
[184:15.95]Oh my lord.
[184:16.57]Alright, it's okay.
[184:21.97]We have another one coming right here.
[184:27.34]Hold up as I want the Jetson car.
[184:29.52]Good, it's fast too.
[184:40.64]You think you can outrun a car?
[184:42.94]Judging by how slow some people drive in this game.
[184:45.48]I think so.
[184:57.19]Just curious.
[185:01.05]Anything in here?
[185:02.41]No.
[185:05.31]No.
[185:07.49]Not this time.
[185:11.26]Handles nicer too?
[185:11.96]Yeah, it kind of does.
[185:16.46]This might be the best car in the game.
[185:18.78]This is like... This is the Koopa.
[185:21.62]This is the Toad.
[185:23.62]Of Red Faction Guerrilla.
[185:25.84]Not too fast.
[185:26.74]Not too slow.
[185:27.96]Really good handling.
[185:30.77]You're not going to drive into walls like you are when you play Donkey Kong.
[185:34.75]You're not going to skid all over the place like when you play Yoshi.
[185:37.39]No.
[185:38.39]You're just calm and collected.
[185:40.95]High-importance target located.
[185:45.41]All these three things?
[185:46.23]Okay, well, easy.
[186:10.39]Smokestack!
[186:17.11]Might as well just use the hammer for this.
[186:18.41]Yeah, high importance.
[186:29.31]Oh boy.
[186:29.79]Easy.
[186:36.70]Get rid of this smokestack.
[186:44.44]Come on.
[186:45.26]One more.
[186:46.46]Wow, easy.
[186:52.69]Stuff in here.
[186:57.13]He's back with a car, Jack, to attack the smokestack.
[187:01.39]Pretty much.
[187:01.91]Nah, let's wrap around this.
[187:13.62]Well, you guys are in trouble, so bye.
[187:15.06]Alright, opportunity here.
[187:19.16]Get in the Ghostbusters car.
[187:24.90]Just shoot these.
[187:32.02]Why are you alive?
[187:38.68]Good.
[187:41.14]Free scrap everywhere.
[187:42.48]Pick it up.
[187:44.75]And then get in the Ghostbusters car and leave.
[187:50.99]That's kind of a lot.
[187:51.93]Yeah, let's go.
[187:58.63]Back in the enemy territory again, though.
[188:02.49]Uh, oh, smokestacks!
[188:05.68]Oh, come on!
[188:08.54]I'm gonna destroy all the smokestacks.
[188:10.86]That's the goal.
[188:21.14]Take him out.
[188:23.36]I'm gonna wrap around.
[188:31.26]Okay, easy.
[188:33.38]Gotta get out of this car.
[188:44.62]6 out of 12.
[188:46.92]Even more over there.
[188:48.50]Can I get all the smokestacks, like, right now?
[188:50.24]I'm probably going to get, like, an upgrade or something, right?
[188:52.82]Let's go over here.
[188:54.58]7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[188:54.90]Come on, I can't make it up this.
[189:04.55]I know I can, right?
[189:06.93]Some tactical jumping and I should be able to do this.
[189:09.63]Yep.
[189:11.13]Don't even need to go down there.
[189:13.26]Yeah, I do.
[189:16.30]Hmm, it's okay.
[189:17.26]8 out of 12.
[189:33.63]9 out of 12.
[189:34.23]And then wrap around and get... Don't fall from that height!
[189:51.82]Holy shit!
[189:54.44]That's a lot of EDF coming my way.
[189:59.16]That's like every bad guy in the game.
[190:01.11]It's alright, we just have to get this one.
[190:07.67]There it goes.
[190:09.93]Now we just have to get those last two that were on the other side.
[190:15.77]And that will be all 12.
[190:16.49]Alright, where are those?
[190:19.72]Over here.
[190:24.63]Singularity?
[190:25.29]No, I'm not going to Singularity.
[190:27.51]I need to use it for the bridge.
[190:35.50]Almost.
[190:36.18]There's eleven... I wonder what you get for doing this.
[190:40.02]Hopefully something good.
[190:40.94]Twelve out of twelve.
[190:44.11]Sixty.
[190:44.57]Alright.
[190:45.45]That it?
[190:46.41]Nothing else?
[190:47.97]No free cool thing?
[190:49.57]No schematic?
[190:50.49]No blueprint?
[190:52.43]Huh.
[190:54.01]Nothing.
[190:57.08]Well, oh well.
[191:00.90]Easy.
[191:12.23]Okay, we... Get me in this.
[191:15.85]Get me in here.
[191:16.75]Get in the car.
[191:20.22]Get in the car.
[191:22.64]That guy had his hands behind his back.
[191:25.80]I gotta escape.
[191:27.54]This is not escaping.
[191:28.80]This is not escaping.
[191:33.62]I wish I could find the correct path.
[191:39.62]I love how the AI is super relentless.
[191:45.64]Alright, bridge.
[191:49.13]Perfect.
[191:56.14]Right in the drain hole!
[191:58.09]Ooh!
[192:02.45]The whole bridge is coming down.
[192:04.67]Holy Jesus!
[192:05.61]Are you serious?
[192:10.77]Oh my god, I can't get away.
[192:12.58]Can I get that car?
[192:13.48]No.
[192:13.72]Give me your car!
[192:15.72]I'm confiscating this.
[192:20.12]That guy just got destroyed.
[192:23.98]This thing is slow!
[192:27.25]This is the slowest car in the game.
[192:29.57]I am punching it right now.
[192:30.63]I'm going as fast as I can possibly drive the fucking car.
[192:34.23]And you tell me it's this slow?
[192:37.87]Out with you.
[192:38.31]Out with you.
[192:38.75]Out with you.
[192:39.16]Out with you.
[192:40.04]Out with you.
[192:40.42]Don't prone.
[192:40.90]Go.
[192:48.06]What the fuck, man?
[192:49.44]What the fuck, man?
[192:51.40]Calm down.
[192:52.02]I need health.
[192:59.57]Who is shooting at me?
[193:02.11]I'm not even destroying these properties.
[193:04.29]Somebody else is.
[193:05.11]Oh my god.
[193:12.61]Somebody has a missile launcher.
[193:14.53]It's that guy with the tank.
[193:16.59]Okay.
[193:18.53]Nope.
[193:20.31]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[193:23.61]Uh, nope.
[193:24.35]Don't think so.
[193:27.00]Okay.
[193:27.54]Nope.
[193:29.56]We're getting into space now.
[193:30.94]I can't go over here?
[193:33.28]There's a wall here.
[193:34.02]There's an invisible wall.
[193:36.56]Can't go this way either.
[193:40.47]Am I going to be safe up here?
[193:41.51]Do they know I'm over here?
[193:46.65]This is the invisible wall.
[193:47.61]I don't think the AI is programmed to go over here.
[193:51.97]At least I hope not.
[193:54.57]I think one guy is trying to walk over there.
[194:02.54]Oh, you motherfucker.
[194:07.83]That's not gonna work.
[194:09.23]Why?
[194:10.07]Of all the things.
[194:16.41]Is this gonna do anything?
[194:17.55]Why is he getting this close?
[194:20.28]I can't even go over there.
[194:24.60]Oh, for the love of God.
[194:28.14]I gotta move.
[194:38.28]I'm in deep shit.
[194:39.04]Can I drive the fucking... Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[194:49.65]I couldn't even move.
[194:50.21]I was outside the map.
[194:55.93]Where even was that?
[194:58.77]You're telling me this is outside the map?
[195:04.10]What the fuck?
[195:09.78]apparently I was outside the I was out of bounds somehow and the hind flies out of bounds and I can't kill it no you know no no no I'm going I'm upgrading I'm upgrading the nano gun
[195:41.18]It's alright.
[195:41.56]We're safe.
[195:46.52]Okay.
[195:49.32]Remote charge count.
[195:50.64]Arc welder.
[195:51.12]Grinder.
[195:51.50]Proximity mines.
[195:52.18]Rocket ammo.
[195:52.72]Multi heat signal.
[195:53.50]Nano rifle ammo.
[195:55.56]Or nano enhancer.
[196:03.78]I can almost do both.
[196:09.80]Can you fly in this game?
[196:10.58]I don't think you can, actually.
[196:13.68]Let's get the ammo.
[196:16.56]And, let's see.
[196:19.42]Multi-rockets.
[196:20.44]Rocket ammo.
[196:23.42]Remote charge count.
[196:26.03]Oh.
[196:28.99]I should do this again.
[196:34.99]Rocket ammo.
[196:35.63]Okay, get the grinder.
[196:39.74]Persist enemy armor.
[196:42.41]So can I just run around with this and grind down buildings?
[196:50.05]I don't think I like the rocket launcher very much.
[196:54.69]Seems a little like they don't really care.
[197:03.48]Grinder ammo.
[197:07.40]I'm just curious what it is.
[197:08.66]I kind of want to know.
[197:15.36]I'm just interested to see what it is.
[197:20.02]Oh, get out of the way, car.
[197:21.98]Let's take a look.
[197:29.61]Remote chargers.
[197:30.25]I mean, the singularity bomb, I guess, kind of just taking up a space.
[197:33.33]Let's just see what it does.
[197:36.23]Grindr.
[197:41.18]It's another one of these.
[197:45.58]It actually just shoots a ninja star.
[197:50.18]You can only shoot one at a time.
[197:52.91]This thing seems pretty dumb.
[198:04.55]How dumb is this?
[198:09.39]Hmm.
[198:10.25]Pretty dumb.
[198:12.92]Let's put the nano rifle back on.
[198:18.02]Well, that was a waste of scrap, unfortunately.
[198:22.63]Machine gun is on.
[198:24.01]Singularity is on.
[198:24.97]I just don't have any charges now, but I need to use the singularity.
[198:33.41]Can't even hit buildings with it?
[198:36.37]Oh, well.
[198:38.52]Um...
[198:41.09]I need to go use the singularity.
[198:42.95]We gotta use it.
[198:47.25]Reload the safe.
[198:48.23]No, no, we, no, we, come on.
[198:59.36]Grind up somebody.
[199:00.96]I don't even want it on my bar.
[199:03.90]I'm gonna go blow up the bridge.
[199:09.22]I'm so far away from it.
[199:10.14]I could fast travel though.
[199:15.20]Go prevent the crash.
[199:17.62]Alright, I'll take the bridge out.
[199:22.36]Let's take out the bridge.
[199:32.28]Let's drop a super bomb on it.
[199:33.98]And then laugh about it.
[199:38.48]Slurp.
[199:44.76]Just shoot the supports.
[199:45.68]Yeah, but we want to grind.
[199:46.92]We want to do this ultra demolition on this thing.
[199:55.16]Am I going to use the jetpack?
[199:56.16]If I unlock a jetpack, then fuck yeah.
[199:59.71]The bridge is named after me.
[200:00.91]What are you talking about?
[200:06.55]It's just a bridge.
[200:16.84]It's a projectile, though, so it can cause a lot of... Oh, you see... Maybe, like, in a minute.
[200:21.56]Like, after we do this.
[200:24.87]Wait, what's the name of this bridge?
[200:26.75]That's what... Where do you see the name of the bridge?
[200:33.61]Okay.
[200:39.08]Look, I'm just fucking having a laugh about it, alright?
[200:41.44]Everyone calm down.
[200:50.10]Go back to the crane.
[200:56.48]Blow up my own memorial.
[201:00.00]That's not how it works.
[201:01.10]Hey!
[201:03.09]Somebody just shot a... Alright, this is perfect.
[201:05.51]Perfect.
[201:07.61]I'm gonna get aggro.
[201:09.57]Let's get a ton of aggro here.
[201:12.53]Here it comes, right?
[201:13.05]Get the aggro.
[201:15.59]Give me the aggro.
[201:17.38]God damn it.
[201:20.76]Alright, give me this aggro.
[201:22.54]Perfect.
[201:23.28]Perfect.
[201:25.92]Across the bridge with us all.
[201:27.45]All of us.
[201:27.77]Come on, follow me.
[201:36.01]I want you guys to come with me.
[201:37.49]Down this way.
[201:40.53]So I can singularity all of us on the bridge.
[201:44.89]Can I not pull aggro?
[201:45.69]Come on.
[201:51.28]Alright, I'm ready.
[201:54.58]Nobody came.
[201:56.08]Oh well.
[202:00.84]Alright, let's just get at least like four cars up here.
[202:02.80]Alright, right in the center of the bridge.
[202:09.31]Jesus Christ.
[202:11.93]Bitch.
[202:12.57]Alright, here we go.
[202:14.61]It's time for a singularity!
[202:27.58]It didn't even, like, do anything.
[202:30.59]It just ripped the guy out of the car.
[202:33.13]Now we're just gonna strategically get rid of the rest of the bridge.
[202:43.59]Almost.
[202:44.19]Get rid of this.
[202:48.73]63% We just gotta drop, like, all the support beams.
[202:54.39]Ooh, ooh, ooh, it's crashing.
[202:55.81]I hear it.
[202:56.19]I hear it.
[202:57.21]I hear it.
[202:58.93]Oh!
[203:00.51]Oh!
[203:01.83]Oh!
[203:02.01]I can't move!
[203:06.03]Oh my god.
[203:06.96]I think it's okay.
[203:08.84]Shit's falling.
[203:10.38]I'm getting fucking collapsed on.
[203:11.62]Is there an EDF?
[203:20.56]Oh!
[203:27.98]Come on, come crashing down already.
[203:32.53]Come on!
[203:35.65]What is even holding you up right now?
[203:37.17]This one little thing?
[203:38.47]Did somebody just fall?
[203:46.41]What?
[203:51.00]There it goes.
[203:52.17]See you later, bridge.
[203:52.85]Alright, where's the scrap?
[204:08.51]There's gotta be like a 10,000 scrap here, right?
[204:12.32]I got an achievement for doing that, too.
[204:21.41]Jesus.
[204:22.11]Alright.
[204:26.50]Alright, that was cool.
[204:28.26]R.I.P.
[204:28.88]R.I.P.
[204:29.24]My own bridge.
[204:32.80]Hey, that was fun.
[204:38.00]Can't believe I'm dead.
[204:39.16]The memorial bridge.
[204:42.33]Yeah.
[204:43.33]I'm dead, guys.
[204:45.29]Well, that makes sense.
[204:46.29]I would be dead.
[204:49.45]Doesn't this take place like a thousand years in the future?
[204:56.07]So of course I'm dead.
[204:57.54]I've accomplished so much in my life that I've been memorialized.
[205:02.82]Makes sense.
[205:12.12]The green dot on the radar.
[205:13.32]What do you mean the green dot on the radar?
[205:20.50]Yeah, what is that?
[205:23.44]What is this?
[205:26.82]What the hell is that?
[205:31.50]What is that thing?
[205:32.06]What is this green dot?
[205:33.76]What the fuck is that?
[205:39.68]This planet's gonna make me rich.
[205:44.30]All the deuterium has my name on it.
[205:47.69]But where the hell is my shuttle?
[205:50.01]They were due three days ago.
[205:53.59]Who cares about... What is... Blast from... Collect hidden radio tags to uncover the location of ultra-era bombs.
[206:00.85]This planet's gonna make me rich.
[206:03.56]All the deuterium has my name on it.
[206:06.98]But where the hell is my shuttle?
[206:09.30]They were due three days ago.
[206:17.39]Two more radio tags required for MOAB location.
[206:24.41]I can get MOABs in this game?
[206:28.12]What is this?
[206:32.02]Oh, it's like one of those pulse cannons.
[206:33.46]Alright, well, that's cool.
[206:38.84]The mother of all bombs.
[206:44.75]I think people are accidentally driving off the edge.
[206:50.24]Yeah, they sure are.
[207:00.72]No, it's not the right way.
[207:03.28]It's not the correct way.
[207:08.40]Anyone else?
[207:13.40]Is that guy still alive?
[207:14.34]Is that guy alive still?
[207:17.38]He might be.
[207:21.26]Okay, well.
[207:24.42]I mean, I kind of feel like we have to stay here.
[207:27.90]For like at least a few minutes.
[207:33.53]Anybody else gonna come over here?
[207:36.05]I might just go to the back.
[207:36.99]Oh, someone's alive still.
[207:37.73]Someone's driving.
[207:44.20]Oh, where are you?
[207:44.84]Come on.
[207:45.34]Alright, so here's what's happening.
[207:57.39]I gotta pee again.
[207:59.99]So, um... I'm just gonna go pee.
[208:04.64]And you guys can just watch.
[208:07.02]I'll be back.
[208:08.22]Good luck.
[208:09.28]We'll see if anybody else drives off the cliff.
[208:12.10]Let me use the bathroom.
[208:15.66]Be right back.
[208:22.77]I am leaving.
[208:24.43]See you in two minutes.
[208:36.52]Yeah.
[210:03.20]Did I miss anything funny?
[210:08.28]How many funny things happened while I was gone?
[210:15.64]The driver's all caught on.
[210:16.76]Did nothing happen?
[210:17.52]Nobody died.
[210:18.18]Nothing happened.
[210:22.01]Okay, well, that's unfortunate.
[210:25.99]Alright, let's go.
[210:27.69]I guess I'll take one of these fucking cars that are down here.
[210:37.57]You can't go that way, man.
[210:38.81]You're going to end up blowing all of us up.
[210:44.65]This guy's going to blow up.
[210:46.33]No, he gave up.
[211:00.91]Get out.
[211:02.41]Get out of here.
[211:04.19]Quick, run.
[211:12.39]Oh, man.
[211:14.51]This game is... This game actually might be perfect.
[211:17.75]No.
[211:22.88]They just... No.
[211:23.86]They keep coming.
[211:24.66]I just have to spawn more of them in.
[211:28.62]A couple of cars need to blow up and then more end up showing up.
[211:34.72]It will never end.
[211:36.58]As long as there are cars to spawn.
[211:39.38]We got to go up there is what has to happen.
[211:44.60]Yeah, we got to go up there.
[211:45.90]Cars will start spawning.
[211:49.06]Yep.
[211:51.38]Those are all just going to drive over the bridge.
[211:53.10]I should have went to the... Yeah, see?
[211:54.66]See?
[211:54.82]Look, somebody already spawned.
[211:59.94]And there he goes.
[212:05.40]Okay, see?
[212:06.00]Here we go.
[212:07.30]All we had to do was just get up here.
[212:09.00]So the cars can spawn.
[212:25.51]Okay, well there's one.
[212:27.87]Here comes more.
[212:28.47]Here comes another one.
[212:30.41]I gotta dump this one, though.
[212:31.31]Because this one's getting in the way.
[212:39.42]I'm gonna dump this one after this guy.
[212:50.73]Alright.
[212:51.39]Now it's clear.
[212:52.33]I mean, we could sit here for a long time.
[212:56.91]Some of them just turn around.
[212:57.85]Yeah, I don't know why half of them turn around and half of them don't.
[213:02.81]Oh, God.
[213:03.89]Oh, my God.
[213:04.67]Oh, no, dude.
[213:06.13]Oh, no.
[213:06.73]There's a guy in the back of your truck.
[213:11.06]Like, you wouldn't see that coming from a fucking mile away, dude.
[213:22.56]You wouldn't see that.
[213:25.98]It's like, for real.
[213:29.94]I don't believe it.
[213:31.50]These people are still alive.
[213:34.04]Nobody?
[213:34.32]Oh, here comes another one.
[213:47.39]No, wait, wait.
[213:48.11]There's another one coming.
[213:49.63]I can't, man.
[213:56.78]This shit is so fucking dumb.
[213:59.92]They're all trying to leave.
[214:06.84]You're not gonna go anywhere.
[214:07.98]Is there a plane coming over here now?
[214:11.85]Somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[214:14.01]Hold on a second.
[214:14.69]Hold on.
[214:15.77]This is important to look at this.
[214:16.99]Oh, they're getting out.
[214:21.15]They're getting out of their cars.
[214:23.39]Why are they all getting out and standing?
[214:28.08]No, no, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[214:31.02]Is one of these cars on fire?
[214:32.88]This one's on fire.
[214:33.76]That's why they're getting away.
[214:35.39]No, they're just gonna sit in this car.
[214:38.45]Oh no, this car is on fire.
[214:39.97]Let's go sit in the one next to it.
[214:44.55]Maybe that'll help.
[214:46.76]That might help.
[214:53.82]Is this thing gonna explode?
[214:56.88]I mean, there's a guy underneath all these.
[215:07.03]I don't know.
[215:07.43]It's not on fire yet, is it?
[215:08.63]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[215:14.53]I'll scare these people.
[215:19.10]Alright, well, this will work.
[215:21.96]They're still there.
[215:22.60]Alright, it's on fire.
[215:24.20]Holy...
[215:37.75]I just scared the shit out of myself.
[215:44.22]Population demoralized.
[215:45.58]Alright, I gotta get out of this.
[215:48.26]I'll be here forever.
[215:49.18]I'll never leave this area.
[215:54.27]Alright, time to go.
[215:57.43]Rapid demoralization.
[216:14.83]They're coming in like rapid succession again like it's just I have to look at it it's seriously it is another guy Alright, okay, we're done we're done we're done get me out of this I have to be done here because I Can't even move I keep standing up and getting hit I Don't now there is no escaping this I'm just consistently and constantly being attacked.
[216:40.37]Oh
[216:44.19]No, I don't think there's any getting out.
[216:45.37]Maybe if I press E. Oh, it's that easy.
[217:00.92]Just delete the car.
[217:02.24]Oh, no.
[217:02.58]Didn't work.
[217:02.94]Just melt the car.
[217:06.76]Alright.
[217:07.36]Good.
[217:07.68]There we are.
[217:09.86]Now we're good.
[217:19.89]Why have I found my favorite thing in the game?
[217:26.14]Out.
[217:27.18]We have to get out.
[217:28.86]Okay.
[217:30.12]It's done.
[217:30.98]We've completed it.
[217:31.68]It's over.
[217:32.14]We're not going back there.
[217:34.98]Sir Jimmy Jammer, thank you for the $100.
[217:39.70]Incredibly fucking generous.
[217:40.94]10,000 bits.
[217:45.59]And Sir Jimmy says, I just got out of the United States Air Force basic training and I got to tech school and bought a laptop.
[217:52.87]Seven and a half long weeks out with you, Jarmer.
[217:56.13]It's nice to be back.
[217:58.00]Basic was tough, but making people laugh is what got me through it.
[218:00.98]Thanks for all you do, Jarmer boy.
[218:03.24]Love your favorite airman, Jimmy Jammer.
[218:06.04]Well, thank you.
[218:08.32]First of all, thank you for your service.
[218:09.94]Thank you for your, you know, doing that shit.
[218:14.49]Basic training.

[218:45.14]No, the car's gonna blow up.
[218:52.50]No, no, I'm back in the hole.
[218:55.64]How did I get back here?
[218:57.84]This raider's here now.
[218:59.42]Where did you guys fucking come from?
[219:00.88]Did you know this was people here?
[219:02.22]Did you know this is where all the people come, like the ants?
[219:06.28]Get out of the fucking way.
[219:09.35]And give me this thing.
[219:10.11]Give it to me.

[219:44.87]But what about his gun, too?
[219:46.63]No, it's too late.
[219:48.71]It's a raider hotspot.
[219:56.98]Now that I have to go back...
[220:05.10]Just find me the easiest way to exit this.
[220:07.75]We blew a bridge up, and now I can... Oh, wait.
[220:09.37]Fast travel.
[220:10.11]I can just fast travel.
[220:10.97]We're going to go back to here.
[220:13.33]It's like it never happened, everybody.
[220:18.79]But thank you also to Snooze, who gave $5.
[220:22.81]Jerma made you fan art a few days ago, but I'm not sure if you ever saw it.
[220:26.29]Either way, I love your videos and your streams.
[220:28.75]Well, thanks, man.
[220:30.81]Thank you, Snooze.
[220:36.17]never leave I mean at some point you have to put the fork in it your pot roast is done alright uh there's two different places to go here I could do this or I could do this red faction orders for badlands or what's the V joke I thought it was V to fast travel it's actually y
[221:11.45]Sometimes you have to put your four in it.
[221:14.01]What?
[221:14.45]What did I say?
[221:14.97]Sometimes you have to put your four in it.
[221:20.00]Let's go to this one.
[221:21.80]We're in the Badlands still.
[221:25.76]Let me store this first.
[221:31.26]Do I have enough bits to do anything?
[221:36.96]Personnel detected.
[221:38.02]What does this do?
[221:39.16]It shows enemy troops.
[221:41.86]This is a waste of money.
[221:48.02]Should I just do this to get it out of the way?
[221:49.22]Just to have it?
[221:54.06]I mean, I have just enough bits.
[221:58.47]It detects personnel.
[221:59.51]Well, yeah, I know that.
[222:00.31]But, like, is it worth getting?
[222:01.33]I know what it does.
[222:02.57]I'm doing it.
[222:03.09]Those drones can't hide from you now.
[222:12.38]Alright, so let's store this thing.
[222:13.66]This thing's cool, but... I have a lot of cool things that I... Maybe I'll use... Alright, guys.
[222:24.38]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[222:26.64]We are going to use the saw gun.
[222:30.00]At least temporarily.
[222:30.74]I'm gonna keep the hammer.
[222:42.26]Pulse guns better than these.
[222:43.32]I want to try the saw blades.
[222:45.74]They seem like it could be kind of fun.
[222:46.88]I'm going to use the grinder.
[222:58.40]The later missions are going to be hard, so knowing where they are is good.
[223:02.13]Yeah, that was an early upgrade that I just didn't get.
[223:06.83]Might as well get it.
[223:12.40]Let's do this mission.
[223:13.60]Hooray.
[223:28.09]The last mission is... Wow.
[223:29.89]So the missions just get progressively more ridiculous, I assume, right?
[223:37.59]We'll see.
[223:43.60]This whole area is clear.
[223:46.84]What?
[223:47.22]GPS, why are you telling me to go that way?
[223:48.98]I mean, I could... You really want me to go all the way around that?
[223:56.76]Um, no.
[223:59.52]We are gonna go this way.
[224:01.06]I mean, we're gonna have to cut through a bunch of shit, but I'm not gonna go all the way around.
[224:09.48]Seems like a bad idea.
[224:23.65]This looks interesting.
[224:26.27]It's like a Dark Souls sewer.
[224:29.98]Um... High explosives and grit.
[224:34.06]The building blocks of Mars.
[224:35.40]Okay.
[224:36.54]Um... What do you want me to do?
[224:40.88]Destroy the building?
[224:41.92]What building?
[224:45.75]Didn't say I had like a... Where's my... I thought I got like a big guy for this.
[224:54.01]Okay.
[225:06.24]Okay.
[225:15.12]Where's the guy?
[225:18.12]Where's this machine?
[225:21.76]He's at the bottom?
[225:22.52]What the fuck are you talking about?
[225:25.60]I can do this.
[225:29.34]I'll do this.
[225:30.72]Watch this.
[225:38.09]Gotta cut it off the edges.
[225:42.69]It'll fall down.
[225:43.33]The whole thing will fall in a minute.
[225:49.67]Come on now.
[225:50.97]Take out the sides.
[226:01.26]Now it should, technically.
[226:02.74]Is this going to collapse now?
[226:14.91]Not really.
[226:17.31]Okay, so now what happens if I go to the other side?
[226:19.39]I only have three minutes to do this, by the way.
[226:22.77]Shit, that was my fucking plan!
[226:26.44]That was my plan and it's ruined.
[226:34.22]Ooh!
[226:38.36]Plan saved.
[226:40.04]Here he is.
[226:40.36]And this guy can fly.
[226:49.40]Let's do it.
[226:55.03]Hey.
[226:55.85]Hey.
[226:56.13]Hey.
[226:56.67]He can't fly.
[226:57.51]I'm trying to fly and he won't fly up.
[227:02.35]Boosters don't go.
[227:03.35]You can't fly with the boosters apparently.
[227:05.13]You just sink like a rock.
[227:06.74]You sink to the bottom of the fucking ocean like this cinder blocks on my fucking feet.
[227:11.20]You can't fly up.
[227:12.46]Okay.
[227:12.80]Well, we just got fucking ruined.
[227:14.54]And now I'm done with that one.
[227:22.41]And I was looking at chat and I almost just drove into the fucking... Walk on the pipes... You know, I could, but I'm too... No, we'll do that one later.
[227:31.47]Can I drive up this?
[227:43.07]There's another one over here.
[227:44.87]What are these weird tube missions?
[227:47.37]What is this one?
[227:52.61]Another one of these, like, what are they, like, slide down the slides?
[228:00.39]Okay, so it's... Let's just take a look.
[228:05.94]Alright, I get ten of these.
[228:14.12]What the hell was that?
[228:20.96]Whatever.
[228:21.42]Destroy the building.
[228:26.13]Shit.
[228:28.31]Like, these?
[228:29.61]Oh, okay, yep.
[228:30.33]I do have to destroy these.
[228:33.27]How the fuck am I gonna... Eventually do... I have to slide one of these down?
[228:45.56]I have to... Okay, this is not gonna go down.
[228:50.53]It's gonna stick.
[229:03.53]Okay, I get you.
[229:06.05]I get you, video game.
[229:07.21]Can we start over?
[229:07.93]Okay, start over.
[229:15.28]Okay.
[229:38.92]Damn it.
[229:50.59]We're going to do this.
[229:51.53]Almost didn't make that one.
[230:13.30]Oh, that, like, it's real awkward.
[230:15.57]You don't, your cursor, it's hard to determine where you're actually gonna throw these things.
[230:30.86]Okay.
[230:32.56]We gotta spread them out a little.
[230:34.52]Fuck!
[230:35.10]It's okay, it's good.
[230:35.80]We're okay.
[230:39.33]Alright, let's give it a try.
[230:43.25]And... Detonate.
[230:49.82]It's still there.
[230:58.62]I can't throw them.
[230:59.14]Okay, they're going to roll in the building now.
[231:01.23]Hopefully.
[231:07.39]Come on, roll in the building.
[231:08.51]Like, actually get in there.
[231:19.49]No, throw it.
[231:20.17]Oh, it actually went in.
[231:21.25]No, it didn't.
[231:22.10]I lied.
[231:33.38]Get in there.
[231:34.48]Okay, come on.
[231:36.58]Roll inside the building.
[231:44.02]Unstable.
[231:44.66]Unstable.
[231:45.12]Come on.
[231:45.44]Critical.
[231:45.74]Critical.
[231:46.02]Critical.
[231:46.28]Come on.
[231:48.47]shit alright hold on I can do it I can do it I'm like I'm addicted to this mission I have to do it I know what to do we gotta blow the door open first so let's go with like three
[232:20.48]There we go.
[232:21.12]This is just to open it.
[232:22.46]Okay, now they'll slide in, hopefully.
[232:26.86]That's the theory.
[232:27.46]Let's get a couple more in there.
[232:35.21]Walk down there and crowbar?
[232:36.71]I can't.
[232:37.17]I don't have access to my crowbar.
[232:44.55]Are they getting in the building?
[232:45.96]They're not sliding in there, are they?
[232:48.88]Shit..
[232:55.68]God, fuck you, game.
[232:57.52]I can get it.
[232:57.90]I can get it.
[233:02.87]Get back in the area.
[233:06.33]Throw it back up there.
[233:07.93]Jesus Christ!
[233:33.27]Get the fuck in there.
[233:34.86]Come on.
[233:43.70]Break down the front door.
[233:45.64]What happened there?
[233:46.90]What happened there?
[233:50.42]What happened there?
[233:53.44]Fucking God, why?
[233:56.73]Why is it changing every... I gotta... I'm about to go down the tunnel myself.
[234:15.20]This is the last time we're going to do this.
[234:22.31]This is the final time I'm going to do this.
[234:25.45]We're doing three at a time.
[234:29.41]Line it up.
[234:29.93]There it is.
[234:32.05]Sometimes it gets a little wonky, but that's okay.
[234:34.80]It's alright.
[234:35.34]Make sure it gets in the right spot.
[234:37.06]It's in the correct spot.
[234:39.44]I've lined that up perfectly.
[234:40.88]I'm in the same place as I was before.
[234:42.44]Now it's not even going to get down there.
[234:48.49]like what change what did I do so wrong knock that one okay we got it exactly what I wanted to do now wait put this one down same exact thing why am I holding this so weird and why am I so addicted to doing this alright that one got in the building good
[235:20.25]What the hell was that?
[235:20.91]Okay.
[235:26.46]Same thing.
[235:27.70]Get it down there.
[235:29.16]And... Getting close.
[235:35.99]This time we're going to do three.
[235:38.57]Don't screw this up.
[235:41.57]It was very close to screwing it up.
[235:48.23]Why does this one have to be so different?
[235:50.97]I swear to God, man.
[235:55.57]Oh, come on.
[235:58.17]I know I'm gonna blow off the pipe.
[236:03.82]Well, they're all going down.
[236:10.08]I can't even... I can't go get it either.
[236:16.52]I think it's still going to be okay.
[236:17.52]I think I'm still going to get it.
[236:20.55]Why am I aiming so low?
[236:21.47]Because if I aim higher, they fly out of my hand.
[236:24.65]They're all over the place.
[236:25.97]This should do it.
[236:29.05]Building is critical.
[236:29.95]I did it.
[236:31.03]I win.
[236:36.81]Thank God.
[236:38.23]Give me my 75 scrap.
[236:43.56]Holy shit.
[236:45.02]Alright, we're done with that.
[236:50.27]There are a lot of nodes over here for me to hit, so I'm going to go take these.
[236:57.43]Get a bigger bonus?
[236:58.13]No, we're getting away from that one.
[236:59.58]I'll be there all night.
[237:02.60]I will legit be there all day.
[237:11.25]By the way, can I say that I'm upset about the fact that I destroyed all those 12 towers and I didn't get anything for it?
[237:15.79]I'm not that happy about that.
[237:28.11]Nodes.
[237:29.81]That is right.
[237:30.25]There are good nodes everywhere.
[237:31.99]I almost have a third of the nodes in the game found.
[237:37.73]Which doesn't seem like very many.
[237:43.79]Going that way.
[237:44.27]Okay.
[237:50.32]Slurp.
[237:55.38]Nine out of ten game.
[237:56.38]Smoke stacks.
[238:00.26]No, I mean, let's just talk content-wise, right?
[238:04.81]Defend the area from the troops.
[238:06.29]No.
[238:06.65]Okay, I'm just going to turn around.
[238:16.18]Oh, perfect.
[238:19.40]Look at this perfect setup for me.
[238:22.64]It's almost like they watched the last stream.
[238:30.80]Eat this.
[238:39.70]Crazed man.
[238:41.54]Takes out fucking solar.
[238:45.30]You know what?
[238:45.66]Get on the fucking back of the gun.
[238:50.59]I can't... I can't move, but it's okay.
[239:00.16]Okay, they're not easy to run over, so never mind.
[239:09.24]At least we can get rid of those.
[239:12.63]Explosion.
[239:13.21]Good, good, good.
[239:14.37]Get the scrap.
[239:19.61]The future is cold.
[239:25.01]Come on, shoot it.
[239:26.39]Just hit it enough times where it can explode, please.
[239:29.99]There you go.
[239:32.11]Woo!
[239:36.15]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[239:40.36]Fighting for fossil fuels.
[239:42.24]No.
[239:42.36]Alright, we need to go... Turn around.
[239:54.71]It's very aggressive behavior.
[239:55.87]We need those.
[239:57.95]No, we don't.
[240:00.31]We don't need shit.
[240:03.41]You know what?
[240:03.89]Let's go back to wood.
[240:08.37]You guys remember when, like, wood was a thing?
[240:09.93]We used to, like, burn wood?
[240:11.93]We got plenty of wood.
[240:16.96]Wood.
[240:17.50]Wood.
[240:37.73]Okay, that's right there.
[240:40.39]Can you die in this game?
[240:41.31]Yes, you can.
[240:42.55]Very, very easily.
[240:43.41]Emergency response.
[240:49.28]Checkpoint 1.
[240:50.24]Kill the EDF.
[240:52.42]Let's go.
[240:52.94]Go!
[240:53.10]Kill the EDF.
[241:09.04]What is with this GPS right now?
[241:10.58]It wants me to turn around and go back the other direction and then turn around again?
[241:15.21]I guess.
[241:19.15]Uh, whatever.
[241:28.87]I wish I could aim this gun.
[241:31.71]That would be swell.
[241:40.96]Oh, that just bounces around in the room.
[241:42.64]This thing's actually kind of cool.
[241:48.27]It just ricochets around.
[242:01.24]Get it in the room.
[242:04.80]Okay, this thing... Okay, this thing... Never mind, this thing sucks.
[242:17.58]Yeah, you're fine.
[242:22.84]Did I get him?
[242:27.17]Okay, I got him.
[242:33.13]Yeah, this thing is real bad.
[242:41.30]This thing is not a good weapon.
[242:44.91]If it bounced around like crazy, like instead of rooms, maybe it'd be cool.
[242:49.05]But it doesn't.
[242:52.14]It's just a cookie gun.
[242:57.06]A lot of nodes.
[242:59.36]Kill the EDF at the checkpoint.
[243:00.64]Like this.
[243:13.19]What?
[243:16.31]There we go.
[243:18.53]Apparently that's all I had to do.
[243:23.46]Oh, if you upgrade it, it gives it ricochet.
[243:25.22]Okay, that's cool.
[243:28.92]Might be worth it, but I don't know.
[243:36.07]No, okay.
[243:37.37]For a second I was like, wait a minute, you can't move.
[243:38.63]You're fine.
[243:48.53]I get him?
[243:49.51]No.
[243:54.60]Melt this motherfucker.
[243:56.16]Oh.
[243:57.98]Alright, I'm trying to do something fun there.
[244:02.79]Oh, this thing sucks.
[244:12.07]I need my gun, man.
[244:24.14]Old-fashioned way.
[244:28.60]Gonna have to do this thing like it was old-fashioned.
[244:31.98]One more.
[244:44.97]Dead?
[244:59.14]Die.
[244:59.80]Please.
[245:05.70]Take his fucking head off.
[245:08.12]I didn't even get him.
[245:18.93]How many more?
[245:19.39]Two more.
[245:27.62]Jesus, man.
[245:31.78]Slow down.
[245:32.73]Slow down.
[245:33.25]Oh, he's going fast.
[245:34.67]I can't stop him.
[245:36.95]I need a car.
[245:40.31]He's just still going.
[245:41.23]Shit.
[245:42.41]He's going to make it over there.
[245:43.81]This stupid saw blade gun is a piece of shit.
[245:48.33]I don't even know why I fucking have the damn thing.
[245:54.34]I need to get a car.
[245:57.68]They're like a waste of a fucking slot.
[246:10.00]Fucking die.
[246:14.09]Delete this fucking weapon.
[246:16.67]I'm never equipping this fucking piece of shit thing ever again.
[246:22.19]Get rid of this.
[246:24.47]How do I do this as fast as I can?
[246:27.41]As fast as possible.
[246:29.43]Get rid of this weapon.
[246:30.27]Quick.
[246:34.51]Hurry.
[246:35.53]Hurry.
[246:35.77]Get rid of it.
[246:36.11]That's not the right way.
[246:42.69]How do I sell this thing?
[246:44.47]So it's never in my inventory ever again.
[246:53.62]Let's fucking go.
[246:55.31]Jesus.
[246:56.13]Crap.
[246:57.31]Pick up an enemy rifle?
[246:58.23]It's easier said than done when, like, there's a hundred people chasing me.
[247:02.17]Ugh.
[247:05.71]That thing sucks.
[247:07.83]I should have listened to you guys.
[247:10.75]You explicitly told me that's, like, one of the worst weapons in the game.
[247:13.41]And I'm like, oh, well, let me try it.
[247:14.75]It might be fun.
[247:16.47]And, like, Etalyx came in here and was like, oh, you didn't... Shut up, Etalyx.
[247:27.31]Stop being such a baby.
[247:28.29]I'm just kidding.
[247:28.85]It's a joke.
[247:30.39]It's just a joke.
[247:32.01]Or is it?
[247:33.85]Or is it?
[247:39.23]Trust the chat.
[247:41.13]I usually do.
[247:43.71]I usually do trust chat.
[247:44.91]Sometimes.
[247:46.13]For fun.
[247:54.27]We're back.
[247:56.65]Do it again.
[248:01.14]Get in here.
[248:02.70]We're just going to kill EDF.
[248:06.02]Go for it.
[248:06.64]We're going to go up here.
[248:09.26]Yep, that's the right way.
[248:10.52]Continue.
[248:13.22]I missed a chest.
[248:16.06]I probably did.
[248:16.78]Okay, let's just kill people.
[248:29.19]Let's just do the way we know how.
[248:38.90]The way we are trained.
[248:46.80]You're right here.
[248:47.51]Yeah.
[248:48.59]See ya.
[248:50.37]One more guy.
[248:50.91]I don't have to worry about shooting syringes at people.
[248:59.59]There it is.
[249:02.59]Let me just pick up this ammo.
[249:07.55]I could destroy this stuff, but no.
[249:08.93]That wouldn't be the mission.
[249:13.61]Get back in the car.
[249:15.91]Let's get in the tank.
[249:17.09]Well, this kind of tank.
[249:18.79]Super tank.
[249:23.75]Alright, let's go.
[249:25.17]Follow me.
[249:26.91]And be free.
[249:29.75]Mars GTA looks good.
[249:30.99]It is Mars GTA.
[249:33.29]It's a very good Mars GTA game.
[249:44.79]Slow down.
[249:45.43]Slow down.
[249:45.89]Don't do this.
[249:48.37]It's time for serious.
[249:50.47]You know, we could be serious.
[249:56.49]See ya.
[250:01.16]Okay, well, I've decided that we're just gonna do it like this.
[250:04.88]I don't know, I guess that's just EDF control, apparently.
[250:16.95]I don't know if that does very much for me, but whatever.
[250:24.47]Uh, I think you mostly lost.
[250:25.49]You nominate Just Cause 3 for a future stream.
[250:29.75]That might be fun.
[250:32.76]That could be fun.
[250:35.28]I can see that.
[250:36.76]No, I wanna... Why'd you just turn... You just turned on the engine again.
[250:45.21]Alright, well, that... That's not gonna happen.
[250:56.11]Well, we both just did the exact same thing.
[251:02.86]It's not under control.
[251:04.28]It's not under control actually I Would refrain from stepping on it.
[251:08.49]It's not under control in fact.
[251:09.87]It's absolutely not under control That guy's still living I can't even I can't even fucking I can't even I
[251:35.10]I'm not fucking around now.
[251:41.18]Don't run me over, please.
[251:42.92]What?
[251:43.80]Don't run me over, please.
[251:45.06]I tried to say please.
[251:52.70]I gotta make a... I gotta make a stand here.
[252:19.55]This thing kind of sucks.
[252:23.05]He just drove into walls.
[252:26.93]You're like me.
[252:28.13]We're very much alike.
[252:29.03]Only a couple more.
[252:36.03]Okay, I can get out there right now.
[252:37.23]I'm going to stay here.
[252:37.85]I'm not going to make any dumb moves.
[252:40.96]Let them come to me.
[252:47.12]There's the hero.
[252:47.94]He's dead.
[252:48.28]Two more guys.
[252:54.56]Okay, now I'm going to go over there.
[252:56.22]I'm going to kill him.
[253:03.61]Did it.
[253:06.97]Finally.
[253:09.51]Bonus morale and total self.
[253:10.99]Cool.
[253:11.13]148.
[253:11.15]Nice.
[253:22.41]This is right behind me.
[253:26.57]I might as well just do this right here.
[253:28.25]It's one of those devices right here.
[253:33.87]Yeah, just blow this all up.
[253:40.61]Just destroy this whole thing.
[253:47.64]Now I'm gonna get in the machine.
[253:49.78]Where did you guys come from?
[253:50.92]Already.
[253:57.14]Okay.
[254:00.49]Let's go!
[254:08.61]This thing is so much fun.
[254:09.91]I guess I could just ruin this whole thing.
[254:16.91]Yeah, I was ruining the whole thing.
[254:21.31]See ya later.
[254:25.03]How loud is this for you guys?
[254:26.26]Because I can barely hear myself think.
[254:34.32]Come on, get up!
[254:41.45]That guy just wanted to escape.
[254:45.25]It's alright.
[254:45.91]Let's go.
[254:46.31]Crush this place.
[254:48.87]Alright.
[254:50.95]Alright.
[254:51.23]Now we are going... Here.
[254:59.52]120 decibels.
[255:00.14]It's probably really loud.
[255:01.14]I'm sorry about that.
[255:09.26]Um...
[255:10.68]This thing doesn't really move that fast.
[255:19.09]But it is fun to jump things.
[255:20.03]I'm gonna take this bunker out and then go right to the mission.
[255:40.50]Easy money.
[255:44.72]Holy shit.
[255:46.79]I just, like, went.
[255:47.71]I'm just tackling this building.
[255:54.99]Doesn't even matter.
[255:56.61]Nothing matters.
[255:58.93]Just fly away.
[256:05.54]Plus three.
[256:06.38]Nice.
[256:09.68]I'm just a kid throwing my toys around.
[256:11.30]I'm going to have to get this off of, um... Red.
[256:17.34]Right.
[256:21.64]Sweep this guy.
[256:22.77]I'll just step on his head.
[256:26.27]That works.
[256:27.01]I might not be able to... I might have to get away.
[256:28.73]Yeah.
[256:30.93]They're just going to keep coming, aren't they?
[256:35.41]Goodbye.
[256:35.83]Uh...
[256:43.80]Damn it.
[256:44.68]I can't fly up there.
[256:45.50]That'd be so great if I could fly up and just grab this guy.
[256:50.48]Sneeze!
[256:51.42]Oh, I just sneezed all over my arm.
[256:53.60]Alright, I gotta go.
[256:54.24]I gotta get the... Ow.
[256:58.26]Up, up, up, up, up, up.
[257:00.32]Up, up, up, up, up.
[257:03.73]Up.
[257:07.15]Come on.
[257:11.23]No.
[257:12.03]Not gonna happen.
[257:14.88]That's not going to happen.
[257:16.41]I have to take this thing out, though.
[257:17.99]Because it's going to cause me... It's not going to stop.
[257:27.95]I was going to die if I didn't do that.
[257:29.03]I was in so much trouble.
[257:35.55]Okay.
[257:37.67]We're hopefully in the clear.
[257:45.22]Or maybe we're just getting even more surrounded.
[257:54.22]Where is, of course... I was trying to shoot the wing.
[258:09.01]There it is.
[258:13.41]I don't think this is going to work.
[258:16.25]I'm just surrounded.
[258:19.01]Everybody knows where I am still.
[258:22.07]How could you even know where I was?
[258:22.95]I'm like on a fucking mountain.
[258:29.21]Where am I supposed to go to get away from this?
[258:32.93]What the fuck, man?
[258:42.28]That was a good shot.
[258:43.48]Didn't kill anybody, though.
[258:49.35]Where's the nearest safe house?
[258:50.37]Should I just, like, teleport or something?
[258:53.79]Can I fast travel like this?
[258:57.18]No, I can't.
[259:02.22]Why is everybody doing Jerm of Moon?
[259:05.96]Let's go this way, I guess.
[259:06.90]Just running in circles trying to avoid this.
[259:09.73]I got reinforcements.
[259:16.03]Well, I don't, like, want reinforcements.
[259:21.45]I want to escape the EDF.
[259:25.17]Dude, I just want to commandeer the vehicle.
[259:29.82]Unbelievable.
[259:31.92]And now I can't even go back this way.
[259:33.53]Yes, I can.
[259:47.03]Alright, if you have a system like this... Okay, here we go.
[259:49.49]Here comes a complaint of this game.
[259:51.59]If there is an escape the people mechanic, where you have to get away and hide until you get to a better non-alert level, how can everybody see you wherever you are?
[260:02.68]How are you supposed to escape ever?
[260:08.18]Like, why even have this mechanic?
[260:09.42]It's impossible to get away from anybody.
[260:17.50]Like, I'm so far away now.
[260:19.70]Come on.
[260:25.91]I usually just drove until I lost them.
[260:27.71]Well, maybe I'll do that too.
[260:28.53]Yeah, I guess you just have to drive straight and fast.
[260:38.13]Well, now I'm almost, like, at the safe house.
[260:39.53]So, like, I might as well just turn around and refill my ammo and go back.
[260:47.85]There it is.
[260:49.94]Refill my ammo.
[260:52.44]And get the hell out of here.
[260:54.52]Don't kill anybody.
[260:55.46]Please don't hurt anybody.
[260:58.36]You're smart.
[260:58.78]You dove out of the way.
[260:59.66]Good for you.
[261:00.58]I don't have enough metal for anything.
[261:05.36]Remote charge count.
[261:11.11]Nano enhancer is 500.
[261:12.03]Let me just get a few hundred.
[261:15.73]Can I break something?
[261:18.37]I'm going to start smashing stuff until I get my way.
[261:20.43]You know what I mean?
[261:20.97]Nothing in there.
[261:25.74]I just got to break stuff until I get my way.
[261:30.62]Come on.
[261:30.88]There's got to be some random piece of junk around here.
[261:32.70]I can just get like a few, right?
[261:34.74]Never mind.
[261:41.43]Never mind.
[261:41.95]I've got EDF jet.
[261:47.41]spoiled streamer why am I spoiled I just want an extra 25. alright let's just take a nice car how long have I been streaming for I might I might call it a night here in the next like 20 30 minutes I want more scrap where four hours 22 minutes I haven't gone for a while
[262:16.56]Alright, let's do this mission and see where we're at.
[262:26.12]Good dental.
[262:32.83]This game is so much fun, though.
[262:36.33]It's a very, very satisfying game to play.
[262:43.65]Pass some scrap.
[262:44.41]Yeah, it's alright.
[262:51.71]Fast travel.
[262:52.95]To where?
[262:53.31]To here?
[262:53.63]I mean, that's the closest one, right?
[262:57.28]That's the closest place.
[263:05.48]Satisfying?
[263:06.04]EDF?
[263:08.98]Yeah, pretty much.
[263:12.65]What happens when you destroy everything?
[263:14.49]Well, then I think the game ends.
[263:16.67]That's gonna be the end of the game.
[263:19.63]It's like game over, right?
[263:25.90]Here we are.
[263:26.22]Can I fly one?
[263:26.74]No, of course not.
[263:27.56]Easy.
[263:27.82]You got it.
[263:28.12]Just need to destroy this stuff in the airfield.
[263:30.25]Up there.
[263:58.89]Is there anything besides a garbage truck here?
[264:01.85]What happened to my car?
[264:07.10]I want something besides the garbage truck.
[264:08.68]Hold on.
[264:08.98]I think I just passed something.
[264:22.77]Alright, clear the airfield.
[264:24.57]OK, I'm at the base.
[264:26.95]Avoid the guards if you can.
[264:30.79]Forward the guards if you can.
[264:32.15]Did he just say, oops?
[264:37.42]I think he just said, oops.
[264:41.74]They're still here.
[264:43.46]What?
[264:44.50]What is happening?
[264:45.30]What?
[264:45.84]Am I getting inside?
[264:47.60]What the fuck is happening?
[264:48.30]What am I doing?
[264:50.24]What?
[264:54.03]What?
[264:54.69]What did I just do right there?
[264:57.11]I'm so confused.
[264:59.49]Like, I just, like, okay.
[265:03.53]I thought I was gonna fly that.
[265:05.69]No, I have to go up and, like, rig them.
[265:09.21]And then they explode.
[265:10.61]Okay, I don't blow them up with my own... Like, whatever.
[265:14.42]What the fuck was that?
[265:19.02]I, like, planted a bomb on them.
[265:21.30]And then I didn't know how to detonate it.
[265:22.44]And apparently it just detonates by itself.
[265:31.84]Jerma lives in a state of confusion.
[265:33.14]Uh, when, like, when I don't know what the fuck to do, yeah?
[265:41.85]So apparently I have to sneak in here.
[265:43.65]But, like, there's a guy right here.
[265:49.38]Alright, don't turn on the alarm, dude.
[265:56.68]Avoid the guards if you can.
[265:58.98]These guys have, like, 5,000 meter field of view.
[266:10.05]There's one guard here.
[266:11.01]Let's see if I can get up behind him and smash him in the head.
[266:22.74]Where's this other guy?
[266:23.40]There's one there and then one across.
[266:28.27]No, he's just gonna see me.
[266:29.91]Oops.
[266:40.72]Being real stealthy.
[266:44.10]Stealth is a crucial part.
[266:45.84]There is no such thing as stealth in this game.
[266:47.64]It doesn't exist.
[266:53.53]Like, stealth does not exist.
[266:55.83]People will see you from across the whole map.
[267:10.69]How do I detonate that shit?
[267:16.93]Press V?
[267:19.77]Is there a detonate?
[267:21.79]I planted a bomb on it.
[267:25.73]What is going on right now?
[267:28.35]How do I detonate those?
[267:31.25]Okay, well, I got a better fucking idea.
[267:46.54]But why don't I just just do what what if I go up and plant them?
[267:51.12]That is the dumbest fucking way to do that mission just shoot them with the nanogun and they'll all disintegrate What just I could just sit across the fucking map and shoot them with a nanogun what's the point of that?
[268:06.77]The charges blow up and then reach 10 meters in altitude oh
[268:11.40]I'm just going to spam them with the fucking gun that I put money into.
[268:15.82]What's the point of any of that shit?
[268:20.66]Watch this.
[268:25.17]Hold your screams, everybody.
[268:28.03]I'm going to get up here and I'm going to beat this mission in 30 seconds.
[268:35.09]There's no such thing as stealth in this game.
[268:36.57]Why would they put a stealth mission in this game?
[268:41.23]I'll be fucking stealthy about this.
[268:45.09]Eat shit.
[268:45.99]One, two, three.
[268:46.97]Doesn't even work.
[269:02.69]Okay, it did work.
[269:04.15]What?
[269:13.64]It's like kind of working.
[269:25.21]I don't know what to say.
[269:26.47]Apparently it kind of works.
[269:27.81]Maybe.
[269:42.34]Where is he?
[269:44.83]I gotta make this shot count.
[269:45.97]Have to make this shot count.
[269:46.93]Right in the wing.
[269:48.33]Got it!
[270:00.63]I did get it.
[270:02.13]Y'all saw that.
[270:02.99]I got it.
[270:03.69]I actually got it.
[270:05.21]I did it.
[270:11.69]That light is right here.
[270:18.41]I win.
[270:19.53]Game over.
[270:34.52]Can't move.
[270:37.80]Okay, there's my goal.
[270:38.86]There's my girl.
[270:42.24]There's my girl.
[270:50.51]There's my girl.
[270:51.41]Right there.
[270:51.89]That a girl.
[270:55.65]That a girl.
[270:56.97]There it is.
[271:07.68]Morale bonus.
[271:08.38]There it is.
[271:09.06]Hooray.
[271:11.58]Badlands liberated.
[271:13.86]See you later.
[271:16.73]Level 2 armor.
[271:17.51]Thank god.
[271:23.87]That's actually worth purchasing.
[271:25.11]Alright, so... We can do up here.
[271:33.40]Let's fast travel to here.
[271:35.48]Get my... Let's do this next mission and then I'm going to end the stream.
[271:47.80]Excuse me.
[271:52.40]I'm about to break the... I'm about to start breaking walls down if I can't go the fuck out of my way.
[271:57.17]What a rage.
[271:58.51]Like, what a psycho.
[272:00.05]I didn't go in the front door, so I started swinging a hammer at somebody.
[272:03.69]Wow.
[272:06.15]I'm just a bag of shit right now.
[272:08.39]I'm a bowl of fury.
[272:14.04]Level 2 armor.
[272:14.72]300.
[272:14.74]Get it.
[272:14.92]Nice.
[272:24.69]Alright, we got a recharge.
[272:26.03]Cool.
[272:26.61]Let's do this and then let's go do that.
[272:31.95]And here we go.
[272:33.05]We will end the stream after this.
[272:38.59]We'll do this last mission.
[272:40.99]Oasis mission briefing obtained.
[272:42.19]Red faction order sure.
[272:45.56]Did the armor change the character model?
[272:48.74]I don't think so.
[272:56.77]I think it adds a couple of notches on his back.
[273:04.58]Only cowards wear level 2 armor.
[273:06.32]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[273:06.74]You want me to not wear armor?
[273:12.29]It does.
[273:12.73]Streamer is blind.
[273:14.09]No, streamer hit escape and got in a car and got to see his character model for four seconds.
[273:20.55]Let's see.
[273:20.91]It is different.
[273:34.85]Shut up, you know what actually Give me this give me this bus Is the guy still on this bus it's a guy's desire is it there's a guy there's a guy Oh my stomach
[273:58.31]You'd think that you wouldn't want to jump out of a moving car that was going that fast.
[274:01.57]But, you know, I ain't you.
[274:04.71]Sorry.
[274:05.11]I feel kind of bad about taking the bus now.
[274:09.88]That was a straight-up bail.
[274:11.92]Ay-yi-yi.
[274:16.14]I love how they both did it.
[274:17.00]They must have been together.
[274:20.44]They made that split-second decision.
[274:21.90]And then one of them did it, and the other one was like, Oh, great.
[274:24.92]I guess I have to do this.
[274:32.13]Take a Jetson.
[274:32.63]This is kind of a Jetson's car.
[274:35.53]In a way.
[274:37.01]In a roundabout way.
[274:37.77]There's a lot of materials here.
[274:45.00]Did not expect to get out of that side of the car.
[274:47.16]What a funny stream moment.
[274:48.44]Yeah, I agree.
[274:49.16]The owner is a contractor with access to the EDF security network.
[275:00.18]Our plan is to steal the access codes off his system.
[275:03.72]Mason, your job is simple.
[275:05.98]Keep the EDF away.
[275:08.08]Mystery mission.
[275:08.57]Block their approach along these routes.
[275:10.15]Here, here, and here.
[275:11.91]Hold them back until our team is clear.
[275:13.73]Alright.
[275:17.71]Last mission of the stream.
[275:20.26]Eliminate.
[275:20.74]Eliminate.
[275:21.10]It's got to be a better car here, right?
[275:29.09]There's no other vehicles besides the dumb mystery machine.
[275:34.13]Okay, fine.
[275:40.67]What about this?
[275:41.23]There's another one right there, right?
[275:42.47]Yeah, get out of here.
[275:44.43]I don't want this thing.
[275:49.07]But there is.
[275:50.93]There is one of these.
[275:54.71]You think I'm just not going to get in here?
[275:56.01]Are you going to have this available to me?
[276:17.67]Game's easy.
[276:18.70]It's the easiest game I've ever played.
[276:24.12]Where's the team?
[276:31.11]Why are we scrapping the mission?
[276:44.38]They turn the corner and they're like, ah, dude, you weren't supposed to fucking destroy the whole thing.
[276:48.89]Oh, fuck.
[276:50.39]Okay.
[276:56.19]Well, looks like we just have to kill EDF.
[277:00.43]Easy enough, right?
[277:04.23]Do not destroy, like, the burger joint.
[277:17.47]There we go.
[277:18.69]That makes it easier.
[277:21.13]Now I'm going to get inside of this thing.
[277:27.56]Yeah, I can't touch anything as a giant robot.
[277:29.30]It's really bad news.
[277:38.47]Alright, let's get to work.
[277:46.02]I'm headed towards the roadblock.
[277:49.64]There it is.
[277:52.72]Just flip cars.
[277:54.36]All I heard was flip cars over.
[278:00.53]Stop the incoming EDF.
[278:02.69]They come down this road.
[278:05.87]Oh, you better believe it.
[278:06.83]We're just going to flip cars over the edge.
[278:11.45]Why else would we do anything else?
[278:21.67]Gonna aim correctly and throw them over.
[278:24.09]That's all we're gonna do.
[278:26.59]This first line of defense is gonna go down, but I can't stop that.
[278:33.44]Keep going.
[278:35.26]You're driving over rocks.
[278:38.74]Nope.
[278:39.48]I feel like I have to do something about this.
[278:44.77]There.
[278:45.33]I did my part.
[278:54.74]I feel like there's too many reinforcements here.
[278:56.32]Is that guy stealing this car?
[279:03.93]Okay.
[279:09.12]From where, again?
[279:10.08]Like, from over here?
[279:10.88]Okay.
[279:15.12]For a mission being this late into the game, this is not that difficult.
[279:21.26]By the way, I thought those were my legs in the back sticking out.
[279:23.40]Like I was lying down.
[279:24.32]Those are my knees.
[279:25.38]I thought I was lying forward on my stomach.
[279:36.43]This roadblock is sort of actually in the way.
[279:46.55]Alright, see ya.
[279:54.21]Where is he?
[279:54.49]He's driving in a different direction.
[279:57.60]Well, I guess they're like spreading out.
[280:08.30]He's dead.
[280:11.33]They're just piling on top of each other over here.
[280:13.35]Uh-oh.
[280:14.51]Uh-oh.
[280:14.95]Uh-oh.
[280:15.27]Uh-oh.
[280:15.59]Uh-oh.
[280:15.85]Actually, that is an uh-oh.
[280:21.76]This is an uh-oh.
[280:22.48]And I just, I got like kind of bored and it was an uh-oh.
[280:24.76]Alright, like I got fucking bored.
[280:33.62]Because that's what happened.
[280:34.62]And like I, I, I, now I'm taking it for granted.
[280:46.28]Uh.
[280:46.36]Alright, I'm like, I gotta calm this down.
[280:50.69]I'm almost dead.
[280:52.85]What was that explosion?
[280:53.65]I think it's still alive.
[281:17.61]Did I win?
[281:19.81]I gotta get out of this.
[281:28.43]What's west of the factory?
[281:30.47]Stop the final assault.
[281:31.65]Where is it coming from?
[281:34.36]It's coming from here.
[281:35.10]I gotta go this way.
[281:49.35]Holy shit!
[281:56.39]Why would you make me get on this gun?
[281:58.67]Why would you want me to get on this gun?
[281:59.75]Get off this gun!
[282:00.43]Get off!
[282:01.90]Why would it tell me to get on that gun?
[282:05.14]For real?
[282:05.96]Why would you fucking tell me to do that?
[282:07.84]It's like, get on this thing, buddy!
[282:10.66]No fucking way.
[282:13.72]Go!
[282:14.10]Come on!
[282:14.54]Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
[282:16.24]Charlie and the fucking Chocolate Factory!
[282:17.74]Go!
[282:19.04]What happened?
[282:20.50]I just turned on sticky keys.
[282:29.72]My whole game is fucked up right now.
[282:34.17]I'm gonna lose this mission because of this.
[282:40.87]Un-fucking-believable.
[282:43.95]I gotta get out.
[282:49.70]fucking pain in the ass gave a license revoked what the fuck Microsoft why do you have sticky keys still after like two decades no one has ever used it and whoever has used it they're a fucking idiot like they're they're a dumb person and I lost and I like honest to god
[283:17.19]I know I can turn off sticky keys, but why does that fucking feature exist?
[283:27.45]And why did it, why was it pointing at the stupid fucking turret for me to get on?
[283:35.46]Oh my god, half of my fucking, my resolution is gone.
[283:41.54]Jesus Christ.
[283:45.44]Yeah, but hey, but delete, like, remove paint though, Microsoft.
[283:48.16]That's a great fucking idea.
[283:49.22]Hey, I have an idea.
[283:51.74]Uh, you know, sticky keys still fucking exist, but let's remove paint.
[283:56.19]Doesn't that sound like a smart fucking thing to do?
[283:59.25]That was already dead.
[284:10.01]Keep your eyes open.
[284:11.12]Our team should be there any minute now.
[284:16.16]I can't give you one reason why anyone would ever use sticky keys.
[284:23.27]It just exists for no reason.
[284:25.11]Like, nobody deleted the line of code for sticky keys.
[284:35.63]For some reason, it still exists.
[284:45.24]Salt bomb.
[284:46.18]It is a salt bomb.
[284:47.14]I can't even fucking believe it.
[284:48.62]It's been like 17 versions of Windows.
[284:51.73]You haven't figured out that, like, I would like to see how, like, if a person that uses that feature, I want to know who they are.
[284:58.32]I want to know what their name is.
[285:00.70]I want to know what they do for a living.
[285:02.30]And I want to know why they care about sticky keys.
[285:14.84]And I'm just on like tilt right now.
[285:19.15]Where is he going?
[285:20.01]Oh my god.
[285:20.91]Don't.
[285:21.35]He's just gonna drive over there.
[285:22.65]I'm so done with this mission.
[285:29.32]I really am.
[285:30.00]I'm just fucking done with this stupid fucking mission.
[285:37.20]Fuck off.
[285:38.77]I'm just gonna stay here.
[285:47.81]I forgot the robot.
[285:48.47]I don't want the robot.
[285:53.16]The robot is like... At that final mission, the robot's a pain in the ass to have.
[285:56.82]So I'm just going to do it like this.
[285:58.46]I'm going to make the fucking roadblock.
[286:03.89]And I went...
[286:11.04]No.
[286:11.46]God damn it.
[286:13.00]God damn it.
[286:15.44]I swear to God.
[286:17.54]Get in the fucking... Get in the car.
[286:32.43]Fuck you, game.
[286:36.64]God, cross the fucking bridge.
[286:58.75]Cross the bridge.
[286:59.97]I dare you.
[287:04.26]They're all so dumb.
[287:05.10]They won't do it.
[287:06.10]What do you mean we're under attack?
[287:08.74]Huh?
[287:12.52]How did they get over?
[287:13.18]I thought they didn't go over the bridge.
[287:22.03]I'm gonna lose the mission again.
[287:25.21]I'm going to bed after this, by the way.
[287:26.51]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[287:30.80]This is so stupid.
[287:32.56]They went like a different path this time.
[287:36.26]What a fucking joke.
[287:40.70]What like a pain in my dick, really.
[287:50.53]Where- they're going around the back.
[287:52.25]They're going all the way around.
[287:56.19]Why are they going all the fucking way around?
[288:01.34]Fuck this.
[288:13.73]Get out of here.
[288:14.86]I will sit here and spam on this.
[288:16.26]Population demoralized.
[288:17.36]Good.
[288:28.11]Explode.
[288:29.41]Goodbye.
[288:30.39]One more.
[288:31.79]One more guy.
[288:32.31]Oh, there's a rocket turret.
[288:44.86]Why don't you get on this rocket turret, buddy?
[288:47.58]Right?
[288:48.36]You want to get on this so they can drive right by me?
[288:54.81]Now they are going to drive by this.
[288:59.83]BabyRage.
[289:03.51]I can't screw this up.
[289:04.33]I have to hit every single one of these hits.
[289:08.29]I have to hit every single one.
[289:09.15]In fact, we're going to get this out of the way.
[289:11.09]Because this will get in the way.
[289:13.21]Whatever.
[289:14.83]I'm going to accidentally hit that wall.
[289:19.65]Come on.
[289:20.27]Bring it on.
[289:24.99]Look at this guy.
[289:25.55]He's freaking out.
[289:30.06]Okay, it's three hits per vehicle.
[289:33.37]Easy.
[289:34.39]Just hit every shot.
[289:35.31]Don't miss.
[289:40.05]Just don't miss.
[289:44.81]I can't stop them if they're idiots.
[289:46.08]This is actually going to be hard to hit anyone because they're so bunched up.
[290:00.65]Come on.
[290:01.49]Somebody got in.
[290:02.63]No, they didn't.
[290:03.01]I thought somebody just actually flew over the hill and got in.
[290:15.14]I'm not getting off this until I know it's done.
[290:16.62]I mean, don't let them follow us.
[290:23.02]Are they going the other way now?
[290:24.32]No.
[290:24.46]They're wrapping around here.
[290:29.36]One more.
[290:30.66]WAIT A MINUTE!
[290:31.08]THAT'S THE T- Okay.
[290:32.83]Oh!
[290:38.97]Alright.
[290:39.67]I win.
[290:42.07]I thought I just failed the mission.
[290:48.18]Six fuckin' morale.
[290:50.44]Six morale.
[290:53.75]Alright.
[290:55.17]Look at all this scrap.
[290:58.95]Get it all.
[291:01.41]That is a lot.
[291:02.03]I'm glad I can actually pick it up.
[291:11.24]I thought you just failed.
[291:13.50]I would have cried.
[291:14.28]Are we still going?
[291:20.79]Should I still stream?
[291:21.71]What do you think?
[291:23.13]Do you want to keep going?
[291:26.55]How many people?
[291:27.13]I know it's late.
[291:28.47]It's late right now.
[291:29.21]How many people are still here?
[291:32.65]Should we keep going?
[291:38.44]I'm tired.
[291:38.94]No, it was just that mission.
[291:40.34]I'm fine.
[291:40.74]I'm good.
[291:43.58]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[291:44.82]Alright, well, let's keep going for a little bit longer.
[291:51.06]There's plenty of stuff to do over here.
[291:54.94]How much more is left in the game?
[291:57.86]Those of you guys that have beat this game and played this game.
[292:01.44]What percentage am I done with the game, do you think?
[292:05.90]A little bit more than halfway?
[292:07.14]More than that?
[292:07.58]Something like that?
[292:11.59]I'm killing my phone battery.
[292:14.97]I'm like... I think more than halfway.
[292:22.35]Three-fourths.
[292:25.03]40-50%.
[292:25.35]Fifth of the way.
[292:26.99]I'm getting a lot of fucking different responses.
[292:30.45]You're like halfway done.
[292:31.97]10%, 5%, 40%.
[292:32.19]You're done.
[292:33.37]Alright, let's do this transporter.
[292:38.43]No, actually... I have to destroy stuff in this area.
[292:45.87]Let's go down here.
[292:46.58]Let's cause some problems.
[292:48.54]I need a... I need a refill, though.
[293:00.00]Oh, you're done.
[293:01.08]No.
[293:02.80]I am going to get hungry soon, though.
[293:03.98]I've been streaming for five hours.
[293:05.38]Alright, let's go for like... Well, just go until I'm done.
[293:10.93]I don't know when that'll be.
[293:11.63]I was hoping I could knock the chair over in here.
[293:30.67]Alright, we got Nano Enhancer.
[293:32.83]That's good, definitely.
[293:36.62]Does more damage.
[293:37.32]Let's refill and then blow up some shit.
[293:57.65]She's still sitting in the chair She actually still is in the chair She's permanently in the chair She's never going to not be sitting in this I wish I could pick this up
[294:27.08]Let's play golf with this lady.
[294:32.06]There we go.
[294:32.80]I saved her life.
[294:37.60]Where's the supply thing here?
[294:42.01]Nano rifle the chair.
[294:42.95]I actually could have done that.
[294:43.67]You're right.
[294:47.23]It's open.
[294:49.59]Refilled.
[294:52.05]Let's go over here and blow.
[294:53.75]Let's take this out.
[294:56.84]And then after we get rid of that, we'll go down here.
[295:01.00]Sounds like a plan.
[295:05.06]Still have a whole other zone in the game.
[295:07.12]Yeah, I can see there's probably another three or four hours in the game.
[295:16.66]No, no 24-hour streams.
[295:20.08]I can barely do five or six.
[295:21.86]I'm not going to be able to do 24.
[295:30.66]For a second I thought I just went through the windshield.
[295:34.08]I can get the drop on this.
[295:37.88]Let's go up the mountain.
[295:44.59]I know I can do it.
[295:45.41]I'm gonna just drop on them.
[295:50.77]Just like this.
[295:52.13]Right through the side door.
[295:58.45]It's already at half.
[296:05.73]Holy shit.
[296:07.53]Alright, well that didn't work.
[296:13.68]I thought that would have worked.
[296:14.86]Maybe I am getting tired.
[296:20.08]Maybe I am getting a little too tired.
[296:25.78]Tactical genius.
[296:26.58]It would have been cool.
[296:31.91]Well, that means it's almost done.
[296:32.93]Alright, no fucking around.
[296:34.21]Let's do it the right way.
[296:39.08]Take a break?
[296:39.68]Well, I mean, it's... It's, like, almost midnight here.
[296:42.68]I don't know if there is any breaks.
[296:46.24]Taking a break and coming back, I'm not gonna start streaming again at, like, one in the morning.
[296:50.86]Nope, we're just gonna go until I don't wanna go.
[296:58.00]See, that's what happens.
[296:58.72]One asshole causes, like, a five-car pileup.
[297:01.52]And then everybody's insurance has to get involved.
[297:03.92]It's never fun.
[297:09.74]Streaming one.
[297:17.94]Maybe I am not in the best shape.
[297:20.56]I just want to go through here.
[297:23.39]I just want to go through it.
[297:25.75]Let's go around.
[297:38.65]Oh, boy.
[297:45.39]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[297:46.63]I can't shoot through it.
[297:47.35]It's a grate.
[297:48.15]I have to smash through with my hammer.
[297:53.54]Oh, I'm dead.
[297:55.66]I think it's time to go to bed.
[297:58.52]I'm like just all fucked up right now.
[298:00.46]I can't even play.
[298:01.26]I'm tired and I'm hungry.
[298:11.45]I'll give this one more attempt.
[298:20.11]Trying to shoot through the chain link fence.
[298:28.65]So this thing's actually pretty cool.
[298:35.72]Food is really strong.
[298:37.56]I don't know what it's been lately.
[298:38.70]I don't know why.
[298:40.32]But I've been, like, not eating and turning on my stream.
[298:45.63]Like, I've been just not hungry before... Get out of the way.
[298:49.11]Like, I've just been not hungry before, like, 7 o'clock.
[298:53.60]Like, I've been like... I eat something in the morning, and then I'm like, nah, I'll be alright for a little while.
[298:58.92]And then it becomes stream time.
[298:59.88]Alright, let's try this.
[299:16.83]Eat a food sometimes.
[299:17.97]I know, right?
[299:22.59]Sound like an old man.
[299:28.73]I'm gonna get on top of the trash can.
[299:38.42]Dude, real good job shooting at that mountain.
[299:44.52]No loitering?
[299:45.24]Fuck you.
[299:47.59]I wish I could control this.
[299:48.51]I can't, though.
[299:49.05]Alright, I gotta kill the... I'm gonna hit... Oh, gas station.
[299:57.69]Destroy the gas station first.
[300:06.19]I still have plenty of armor in this thing.
[300:07.61]This tactic is kind of working in a very roundabout way.
[300:13.55]That's gonna explode.
[300:14.41]Alright, I gotta get out.
[300:24.89]Gotta get rid of you up there.
[300:31.61]Come on, you can do it.
[300:32.64]I know you can.
[300:36.80]Shit.
[300:39.52]Where is he?
[300:41.76]Is he sitting behind the lamppost?
[300:44.68]Recharge our armor.
[300:51.43]Don't crush me.
[300:53.30]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[300:54.04]Okay.
[300:55.20]So, here's where we start to pick at it.
[300:57.18]I don't even know where is he shooting me from.
[301:03.43]God.
[301:03.77]There we go.
[301:14.65]You're still alive.
[301:15.39]Alright, let's get it.
[301:26.58]See ya.
[301:26.98]3%.
[301:27.00]3%.
[301:27.02]3%.
[301:28.86]Get it.
[301:29.78]Come on.
[301:30.20]2%.
[301:30.22]2%.
[301:30.24]2% here.
[301:31.16]There it is.
[301:49.15]Alright, I got it.
[301:49.75]I did it.
[301:50.53]That's what I wanted to do.
[301:58.09]I gotta get off this.
[301:58.59]Someone's gonna come to the door.
[302:04.18]Oh, somebody is right here already.
[302:05.30]3% streamer.
[302:12.63]Pretty much.
[302:30.07]Somehow we stay alive.
[302:35.33]This thing is still going.
[302:36.71]Come on.
[302:38.32]Get rid of this damn thing.
[302:39.42]Why are these little boxes so hard to get rid of?
[302:43.60]That's not the correct way, but it's the way we're going.
[302:50.88]First try.
[302:51.48]First hit.
[302:52.08]Got it.
[302:52.30]I'm not going to let it beat me.
[303:03.87]I gotta get rid of this stupid little box.
[303:12.12]Come here.
[303:13.22]Just get me to the top of the hill and I will get this thing.
[303:16.56]Still had one charge.
[303:18.86]I think it's a lost cause.
[303:23.82]Lost cause?
[303:24.98]Yeah.
[303:26.42]Oh well.
[303:30.26]There it is.
[303:33.94]The nano thing does way... This thing is great now.
[303:36.94]Do I have to destroy the box?
[303:37.92]I do not have to.
[303:40.90]That did a lot though.
[303:41.76]Let's just head back to the... Let's head back to town.
[303:51.58]They're just as mean in GTA 2.
[303:52.87]You guys climbed all the way up that mountain.
[303:58.95]That's very, very admirable.
[304:03.11]Too bad it's not gonna help you.
[304:08.76]That was a jumping swing.
[304:13.98]I got that thing down to a fucking science.
[304:30.91]Alright, well I got to where I wanted to go.
[304:39.86]Don't have any salvage.
[304:43.14]Pretty scientific.
[304:44.00]Alright, I got my... Alright, I'm good.
[304:47.30]Let's go destroy this stuff.
[304:51.36]I can't stop.
[304:52.34]I'm, like, having too much fun.
[304:54.96]You guys can... Okay, what if I go get, like, a snack?
[304:57.96]Right?
[304:59.12]What if I get a snack?
[305:03.01]I could get, like, something and just eat it real quick.
[305:04.67]Right?
[305:04.81]Like, egg salad?
[305:07.88]This game's too much fun.
[305:18.29]Cheese nips?
[305:19.73]That sounds really good right now.
[305:23.45]I might do a snack break and then come back.
[305:29.80]Oops.
[305:33.64]Oops.
[305:36.79]I need to go to bed.
[305:37.31]I'm getting addicted.
[305:38.15]Isn't that like... Isn't that a good thing?
[305:40.43]That I actually enjoy this game very much.
[305:46.85]What's this?
[305:50.12]Yeah, I am.
[305:55.66]Oh, this is perfect.
[305:56.30]It's right next to each other.
[305:57.06]Alright, let's go.
[305:58.12]We're not going to get in the dumb bus.
[306:00.58]We're going to get in my hurrah-rah.
[306:06.51]fall asleep in the kitchen?
[306:09.55]I'm not gonna fall asleep in the kitchen, no.
[306:13.32]Addiction is good.
[306:14.22]No, I'm saying I... It's been a while since I've... I've wanted to just play a game.
[306:20.98]You know?
[306:23.74]Well, we're already losing.
[306:24.58]We're already losing.
[306:28.86]There's 21 people here.
[306:33.46]Oh, you didn't think I had the equalizer.
[306:35.86]It's me.
[306:36.54]Don't, nobody come in here.
[306:40.04]Let me just slide around.
[306:40.98]Alright, now I can get up.
[306:55.30]We're currently winning, good.
[306:59.85]Get the hammer out.
[307:00.57]This will make this way easier.
[307:03.37]No accidental killing.
[307:11.22]Six.
[307:12.30]Who's left?
[307:13.98]You over here.
[307:14.58]Whoa!
[307:18.18]Whoa!
[307:20.28]What the fuck?
[307:33.42]Why are there fucking raiders here?
[307:35.91]Give me a break.
[307:37.97]They just decided to show up randomly for no reason.
[307:39.87]They're just surrounding us.
[307:48.14]Let's go this way.
[307:53.22]Like, I can't tell who's, like, team... Are these guys on the other team?
[307:57.26]I guess so.
[308:04.59]Four.
[308:04.93]Three.
[308:08.91]Two.
[308:09.37]One.
[308:11.61]Where's the last guy?
[308:15.12]He's all the way over here.
[308:15.96]I'm going to jump and smash this dude.
[308:20.82]Look at all this.
[308:25.44]Lots of scrap.
[308:45.16]Stop being funny.
[308:49.16]Just went.
[308:51.06]Stop being funny.
[308:58.29]Oh, wait a minute.
[308:58.91]They were talking about this building.
[309:09.39]Holy shit, that was close.
[309:21.92]They were talking about this building.
[309:26.32]Speaking of buildings, why don't we get rid of the rest of these that need to be gotten rid of.
[309:29.95]There's that.
[309:37.27]Take care of this one.
[309:43.68]Melt the damn thing.
[309:51.40]Scrap.
[309:56.23]You still stand.
[309:59.13]Why do you still stand?
[310:00.39]There it is.
[310:07.89]Ooh.
[310:09.03]What's that?

[310:52.18]Like, try saying that word, ammunition, now.
[310:55.72]Nope.
[310:56.64]It's just ammunition.

[311:18.94]I knew it.
[311:19.64]It's okay.
[311:21.61]This place is almost done, by the way.
[311:24.98]Use the cheat you just got.
[311:26.98]We don't do cheats.
[311:37.23]Done.
[311:38.83]Good to go.
[311:50.35]This is a big place.
[311:51.37]I don't know if I have the firepower to take this out right now, but of course we're going to try because I'm dumb and I make bad decisions on stream.
[312:02.46]Why is everything made out of styrofoam?
[312:08.34]Good question.
[312:09.40]Look at all this.
[312:13.97]Look at all this.
[312:14.87]Let's see if I can get some ammo from these.

[313:35.89]Supports!
[313:38.79]Whoa!
[313:42.01]Alright, I only got about a hundred.
[313:43.67]Like, a little over a hundred left.
[313:47.66]Let's skedaddle.
[313:54.72]I'm gonna go that way.
[313:55.68]Actually, can I just go this way?
[313:56.96]Just crawl up the mountain.
[314:02.35]Of course I can.
[314:03.29]Why did I think I couldn't?
[314:05.83]And now this is gonna be a situation... I'm gonna die here.
[314:08.03]It's just... It's inevitable.
[314:10.04]But... Okay, I didn't think it was gonna happen that fast.
[314:33.14]20%.
[314:33.16]Come on, get it.
[314:34.24]Get at least one of these damn things.
[314:40.74]Destroy the vector tower.
[314:42.02]There's one.
[314:43.60]At least if I get both of these, I'll be happy.
[314:53.09]Almost.
[314:55.15]There's ammo right here.
[314:55.95]Uh...
[315:00.85]I'm gonna be... Holy shit, there's a lot of... Alright, we gotta escape.
[315:05.38]Let's go through the door.
[315:08.44]No, we can't go that way.
[315:11.32]I'm dead.
[315:12.28]I'm dead.
[315:12.80]I'm dead.
[315:13.78]No, I'm not.
[315:14.22]I'm still alive.
[315:14.86]I'm dead.
[315:17.38]Shocking that I'm still alive.
[315:18.46]I don't know how I made it out of that.
[315:23.09]I'm going to get all my health back, too.
[315:24.71]That's a big deal.
[315:26.59]Look at that fucking virus over there on the left side of the minimap.
[315:30.07]Look at this.
[315:30.45]It's insanity.
[315:31.77]How the hell?
[315:36.65]Get me through.
[315:37.07]This has got to be my escape route.
[315:43.70]Got it.
[315:45.68]One more.
[315:53.37]There it goes.
[315:55.63]Ooh, where's my escape route?
[316:00.74]Oh!
[316:01.46]Through the escape route.
[316:03.20]Whoa!
[316:04.24]Damn it!
[316:05.08]Oh, did I just blow myself up?
[316:09.46]I think I just blew myself up with my own thing that was down the ground.
[316:15.41]Damn it!
[316:16.63]Oh, that sucks.
[316:17.27]I would have had it.
[316:17.71]Oh, well.
[316:22.52]Oh, I'm so close to... Oh, that's awful.
[316:26.16]I'm so close.
[316:27.06]I have to do it.
[316:28.02]I've got to get rid of it.
[316:29.60]I'm so close to doing the last mission in this area.
[316:33.63]That one guy had to be outside the wall.
[316:35.85]Obviously, right?
[316:39.11]The one dude that for some reason is outside the wall in the one spot that he shouldn't be in.
[316:46.39]Thank you, PoachFest for the bits.
[316:48.10]And GummyMonk for the five bucks.
[316:49.34]Gonna be the last for me for a while, going on an adventure to get my shit together.
[316:54.50]First step is hoarding money like Scrooge McDuck.
[316:57.22]I still love all you guys, though.
[316:59.62]Well, GummyMonk, I wish you luck on your tactical Scrooge McDuck adventure.
[317:06.89]I'm sure everybody here will say, will support you.
[317:18.21]Am I gonna 100% the game?
[317:19.45]No, probably not.
[317:22.83]Just enough where I'm satisfied playing it.
[317:27.63]I love you, friend.
[317:29.87]Yeah, man, that's... Sometimes you gotta go on a soul search.
[317:34.68]I've been there.
[317:38.54]As I, like... As I, like, kill three people.
[317:40.82]Like, whoops.
[317:52.03]How about this?
[317:52.51]We're going to get to the end of this area.
[317:55.49]We're going to finish this zone.
[317:57.81]I think.
[317:59.99]And we will stop the stream there.
[318:11.39]Wait.
[318:13.07]What?
[318:13.21]This is a long way inside of this place.
[318:20.45]Just to go all the way around.
[318:23.82]No, don't get hit by those.
[318:25.04]I just got hit by like four of them.
[318:27.30]What a joke.
[318:29.42]What a fucking joke, man.
[318:31.30]That's not going to happen to me again.
[318:33.36]Get disintegrated.
[318:35.54]Dickhead.
[318:39.79]24 hours.
[318:40.69]No, I don't do 24 hour streams.
[318:44.27]Not a chance in hell.
[318:47.36]I think I can actually snipe this from all the way back here, hopefully.
[318:54.24]You never catch my streams because you're in Australia.
[318:56.12]Well, yeah, Australia is real.
[319:00.18]The time difference is like, what, 14 hours?
[319:04.12]It's like plus 14.
[319:05.64]You guys are literally living in the future from where I am standing.
[319:14.76]What's the future like?
[319:18.47]Because you guys actually are in the future.
[319:23.96]No, Vitalik, no.
[319:25.04]When I'm done with this, we're not streaming PUBG for like 24 hours.
[319:27.76]What are you on about?
[319:28.46]I haven't really been doing very much to this thing.
[319:38.10]Is this just a really dense building?
[319:39.44]Or am I just a really dense person?
[319:47.58]I think I might just be a really dense person.
[319:49.02]I feel like it shouldn't be taking this long.
[319:56.34]Okay.
[319:56.82]Well.
[320:08.50]Got it.
[320:09.74]Zero.
[320:14.22]Save Oasis.
[320:15.14]Sure thing.
[320:15.62]Let's go.
[320:23.01]Well, I can't I couldn't go on that you know what let's just get up here I Don't want that guy to shoot me on the way out Save Oasis there it is Thank you, excuse me I Don't use the hammer uh I use the hammer a lot actually it's just when I'm getting chased by like a thousand people I
[320:51.83]I'd rather be able to just shoot or throw the mines.
[320:55.41]I feel more comfortable that way.
[321:00.62]I can't drive through that.
[321:01.70]What is this, a tree in GTA?
[321:02.96]Come on.
[321:04.90]Thanks for the boost.
[321:08.46]Except not really.
[321:13.86]You can do it.
[321:14.48]I got faith in you.
[321:15.16]You can get over there.
[321:18.04]Just wait for the upgraded hammer.
[321:20.82]I know.
[321:21.24]I'm looking forward to that.
[321:27.58]Sun in my eyes, I can't see.
[321:29.00]Let's do a shortcut.
[321:34.96]Oh, wow.
[321:36.64]Whoa, you're going faster than I am.
[321:41.76]Is he still chasing me?
[321:44.38]No, he wouldn't.
[321:47.36]Are you kidding me?
[321:50.94]Are you fucking kidding me?
[321:53.36]There's an invisible wall over here?
[321:55.16]Alright, well, I guess we have to go on the road.
[322:08.23]I'm just gonna go on the road.
[322:09.03]I think that has an invisible wall over there too.
[322:10.63]There we are.
[322:17.26]Ten minute stream.
[322:22.30]The game can't go on forever.
[322:25.48]No, it cannot.
[322:28.21]But I'm gonna try my damnedest.
[322:37.21]Ayyyyup.
[322:39.67]That instantly lit on fire.
[322:41.06]That poor guy.
[322:45.50]Oh, now I need a car.
[322:47.56]Now I need a new car.
[322:51.86]God damn it.
[322:55.60]Now I'm on fire.
[322:57.88]Oh!
[323:01.94]It's alright.
[323:02.54]There's a car right here.
[323:03.80]It's a garbage truck, but you know, whatever.
[323:06.76]Keep your eyes on the road.
[323:09.34]No.
[323:11.10]Why would I keep my eyes on the road?
[323:13.62]Oh, look.
[323:13.96]There's like the mission.
[323:16.48]I win.
[323:16.96]Oh, shit.
[323:18.56]No, I didn't.
[323:21.21]That's not fair.
[323:21.71]He has a Ghostbusters car.
[323:22.93]I have a fucking dump truck.
[323:26.91]Follow the courier to its destination.
[323:28.67]He's gonna outrun me.
[323:29.87]I'm gonna drive into a fucking wall.
[323:31.15]Look at him.
[323:31.41]He's so much faster than me.
[323:32.31]Alright, he's right here.
[323:36.08]There's no way I'm gonna keep up with this shit.
[323:40.96]I may as well just jump in a different car.
[323:45.60]Like, I might as well just dive off and dive into this car.
[323:47.94]It's too late.
[323:56.30]I'm okay now.
[324:03.64]And he's going far away.
[324:04.52]Why am I even doing this?
[324:05.68]I'm supposed to be doing the other, the actual liberation mission.
[324:10.42]Not follow this guy in the car.
[324:12.42]They're already at zero.
[324:14.22]And I'm going to lose.
[324:14.98]I've already lost.
[324:16.58]Everyone's getting out of his way.
[324:19.00]Like he's a police officer.
[324:20.14]Is he a police officer?
[324:28.16]That's where we live.
[324:33.00]I don't care.
[324:34.18]Don't care.
[324:52.64]I think it's so far.
[324:53.92]Let's just teleport over here.
[324:55.66]I can't.
[324:59.57]The term is getting angry.
[325:01.57]Well, it's not that I'm getting angry.
[325:02.81]I'm getting upset.
[325:05.61]It's a small difference.
[325:15.48]Why is every car in this area slow?
[325:19.80]It's a bunch of garbage trucks and taxis.
[325:23.08]that drive 25 miles per hour.
[325:28.35]The tilt is real.
[325:31.51]No, I'm just gonna go get a better car and go finish this mission.
[325:41.75]Let me have breakfast and go to sleep already.
[325:48.78]I'm home!
[325:51.57]Hope I didn't kill anyone.
[325:52.99]No deaths.
[325:58.06]Jog it up for a success.
[326:01.84]Count fast grinder, explosive grinder, discs.
[326:05.00]I don't want any of this shit.
[326:06.04]I'm just going to get another charge.
[326:10.75]Somebody fire this guy.
[326:18.72]I don't want another garbage truck.
[326:19.98]Why is everything in this place terrible?
[326:26.54]Just give me a buggy or something.
[326:27.92]I actually have to take this thing.
[326:36.80]Well, in case you didn't care about a garbage truck, here's like another one.
[326:46.65]You know what?
[326:47.31]At least it does have a rocket.
[326:48.19]You're right.
[326:52.73]It's a very popular rocket.
[327:04.75]After this mission, that's going to be it.
[327:06.85]We've been going for a long time.
[327:08.59]And it is very late.
[327:10.25]And I do apologize that we've been going for like six hours.
[327:15.30]Into like way too late for a lot of people on a Tuesday night.
[327:22.78]But I do want to try to get as much of this done as I can, because I do want to beat it on stream.
[327:29.55]And depending on how much is left after this, I might... I might finish it tomorrow.
[327:36.53]I might just do, like, an off-schedule stream.
[327:39.89]There's a lot of nodes over there.
[327:41.08]Mm-hmm.
[327:52.32]going to beat Red Faction on stream?
[327:54.24]I mean, I do really like the game.
[328:03.96]But I don't know.
[328:05.06]I'm not going to guarantee you that there'll be a stream tomorrow.
[328:08.71]But depending on how much is left, maybe I'll finish it tomorrow.
[328:14.31]I'll ask you guys what you think.
[328:15.27]Hey, Jimmy Shoes, thank you for the $8.
[328:20.57]Germs, you're the man with the plan.
[328:24.93]Uh, sometimes.
[328:27.29]Other times, there's no plan at all.
[328:28.99]But thank you, Jimmy Shoes, for the eight bucks.
[328:30.43]Appreciate it.
[328:33.34]Thank you for the almost ten dollars.
[328:35.30]Eight dollars.
[328:37.74]Watch out for the clown car funeral.
[328:43.64]Why do I hate my fans?
[328:46.82]What happened?
[328:51.58]Here we go.
[328:51.88]Time to destroy them.
[328:52.54]Cool.
[328:52.74]I'm in position.
[328:53.10]Destroy the tank to the south.
[328:54.74]Alright.
[328:55.24]Well, I do have a rocket here.
[329:21.81]Go this way.
[329:22.65]I wonder if I can aim this correctly and shoot him.
[329:25.95]That would be ideal.
[329:32.74]There he is.
[329:34.46]Got him.
[329:39.18]Got him.
[329:42.85]What's left?
[329:43.29]Another one?
[329:45.85]Second tank is coming from this direction.
[329:49.78]But I gotta watch out for these guys.
[329:56.62]Not bad.
[329:57.98]Not bad for my first attempt.
[329:59.54]Not bad.
[330:00.86]Just gotta get this guy too.
[330:01.78]One more tank.
[330:11.85]Oh, it's two tanks.
[330:12.85]Well... You could have been a little more specific.
[330:22.97]I had to do that.
[330:30.32]Got one.
[330:37.00]I gotta get rid of it.
[330:37.78]Come on, get out of the way.
[330:40.60]Get out of the way.
[330:41.34]He's like propping me up, you stupid asshole.
[330:48.34]Why are you still alive?
[330:51.36]Why the fuck is this tank still alive?
[330:53.71]Holy shit.
[330:58.51]God.
[331:00.51]This is insanity.
[331:02.93]Destroy the remaining tanks.
[331:06.23]Sure.
[331:06.51]Looks like I got rolled over.
[331:13.88]Are you serious right now?
[331:16.74]Oh my god.
[331:18.72]Easy.
[331:22.27]I'm gonna have to disintegrate it, right?
[331:23.29]I have to disintegrate this tank.
[331:31.83]Jesus.
[331:32.31]I don't think that's working.
[331:52.25]Give me a fucking break.
[331:56.91]How fucking irritating.
[332:01.13]You know, I just wish I didn't have to drive back and forth.
[332:17.30]I gotta like drive around in fucking circles.
[332:19.37]It's just annoying.
[332:23.84]Can I steal this tank?
[332:27.30]There's nobody there.
[332:28.60]I have to destroy it.
[332:31.78]Apparently.
[332:32.66]Dude, when they just start pouring in from every direction, they're just a bunch of bugs.
[332:40.51]Like, there's no rhyme or reason for any of these people.
[332:45.15]When the ants start rolling in and the hive starts to swarm the baits, that's where it becomes a problem.
[332:51.31]Like, right now.
[332:51.81]Like, look at these dickheads.
[332:55.21]They're just everywhere.
[333:03.80]Give me that fucking thing.
[333:05.98]Out of my way.
[333:13.21]Get in.
[333:15.83]Where was this thing the whole time?
[333:19.39]Okay, combat.
[333:20.05]This thing's just like hidden over on the side of the road.
[333:25.25]Oh my lord.
[333:35.16]This thing's a little odd though.
[333:43.93]What am I shooting at?
[333:48.04]This thing is slow as shit.
[333:57.87]Oh my god, this stupid McDonald's toy.
[334:00.01]This dumb McDonald's toy is too... Like, come on, man.
[334:18.97]This fucking Happy Meal.
[334:28.32]Get it.
[334:28.64]My screen is shaking.
[334:33.06]Am I aiming in the right direction?
[334:39.27]Oh, my lord.
[334:40.85]Okay, you can't... This is like a model of a car.
[334:46.13]Go.
[334:46.39]Go.
[334:47.67]Come on.
[334:58.36]That was a good guy.
[334:59.10]No, just get over here.
[335:03.96]Just get to this little spot.
[335:11.23]Fuck you.
[335:15.39]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[335:16.57]Forget it.
[335:16.97]Forget it.
[335:17.31]Forget it.
[335:17.63]Just get to the right spot.
[335:18.59]Get to the right spot.
[335:19.51]I ain't gonna have this happen.
[335:23.03]Where is the tank?
[335:24.15]Okay, he's coming up this road.
[335:27.47]I got plenty of time.
[335:28.21]This thing is dead.
[335:33.97]Got it.
[335:46.48]Alright, we're still fine.
[335:48.02]We're still okay.
[335:49.42]I think I'm doing it correctly.
[335:51.72]There are so... This is what I was talking about.
[335:53.36]This is where the bugs come in.
[335:54.78]These cockroaches.
[335:55.96]They're all just cockroaches.
[335:58.96]Let me go intercept this dumb thing.
[336:06.48]There's another one?
[336:12.01]Go back to the crane, he says.
[336:14.59]Go back to the crane, he says.
[336:16.09]I will not.
[336:28.02]Here we are.
[336:29.51]Spam the hell out of this thing.
[336:34.59]Got it.
[336:37.51]Did I win?
[336:38.75]We won.
[336:40.13]Hey, there it is.
[336:42.17]Blitzkrieg complete.
[336:48.40]Oasis has been liberated.
[336:52.76]Do I still play golf with Burgah Boy?
[336:55.68]What are you talking?
[336:56.94]And there's a jetpack.
[336:59.68]Unlocked it.
[337:00.46]Everybody's been looking for it.
[337:01.82]There it is.
[337:04.88]We are free.
[337:07.81]Get me out of this dumb thing.
[337:09.85]That thing was fun, kind of.
[337:10.97]It was cool.
[337:11.83]I liked it.
[337:15.09]Alright.
[337:17.17]So.
[337:20.19]Over here.
[337:23.11]Free fire zone mission briefing.
[337:25.79]So I got to go all the way back here for the rest of the game.
[337:28.53]Alright.
[337:28.85]So that's going to be it.
[337:33.32]How much longer do we got?
[337:36.84]It looks like there is one or two, at least one large zone over here.
[337:42.22]Like one or two zones left.
[337:45.94]Hours wise, those of you guys that know where I am, what do you think?
[337:54.93]I'm just trying to gauge if I could, like, kind of clean it up tomorrow night.
[337:59.45]There's a lot left.
[338:01.98]Two to three hours.
[338:03.80]Six main missions left, maybe three hours left.
[338:07.00]Okay.
[338:10.70]Um... That was the last mission.
[338:17.49]That would be weird.
[338:19.28]Well, thank you for staying up.
[338:20.68]I know a lot of you guys, uh... You know, it's like 12.30 Eastern, so... A lot of you guys over the last couple hours have really wanted to go to sleep.
[338:30.85]Uh, so I'm not sure if I'm gonna stream tomorrow.
[338:33.10]I might continue this tomorrow.
[338:34.36]I wanna play Observer.
[338:35.86]That, like, horror game.
[338:37.48]The guys, the Layers of Fear guys made another horror game.
[338:41.42]So...
[338:43.15]I'm probably going to stream tomorrow night at some point.
[338:46.57]I don't know when.
[338:48.42]And then maybe we'll start Observer on Thursday.
[338:53.32]Maybe we'll do the whole thing.
[338:55.28]Etalyx is telling me about that.
[338:57.88]I'm seeing Etalyx in the chat say, wait a second.
[339:02.22]Why is that, Etalyx?
[339:07.03]Anyways, um, thank you, Multiple Mops of the Bits.
[339:10.82]Uh, use this money to accomplish your dream, whatever that may be.
[339:13.28]Use it wisely.
[339:15.12]Also, I caught Otto's Big Adventure 2 on HBO last night, and I can't figure out who stole the cookies.
[339:20.40]Will there ever be a Part 3?
[339:21.34]Uh, well, yes, there will be a Part 3.
[339:25.84]In 30 years.
[339:28.04]But, no.
[339:29.06]I'm not gonna tell you who stole the cookies, because it was me.
[339:32.95]I did.
[339:33.25]I ate all the fucking dog cookies.
[339:36.92]Because I have like a secret weird dog cookie thing where I eat them.
[339:40.54]I can't stop myself.
[339:43.54]Anyways, thank you all for watching.
[339:45.64]Appreciate all the subs and everything.
[339:48.11]And by the way, the solution for like subs and resubs is going to start being worked on.
[339:56.17]Very, very soon here.
[339:57.59]So like it actually is like going to get like worked on.
[340:01.45]So don't worry.
[340:01.99]I have not forgot about that.
[340:04.97]I've talked about it before, but, like, me and Blordow are, like, gonna have, like, a legit full-on, like, this is the plan.
[340:11.95]So, we'll get that going.
[340:15.22]Anyways, goodnight.
[340:16.56]I may see you guys tomorrow.
[340:18.20]If not, then I'll obviously see you on Thursday.
[340:21.56]Stay tuned.
[340:23.36]Goodnight, everybody.
[340:33.57]you
