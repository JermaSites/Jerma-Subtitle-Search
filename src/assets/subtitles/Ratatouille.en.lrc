[00:28.49]Just kidding.
[00:28.83]That's never happening either.
[00:29.71]That game doesn't even exist.
[00:30.87]How could it happen?
[00:35.18]Mystery game today.
[00:36.06]Fuck you.
[00:39.85]Lisa's amazing, asshole.
[00:41.45]I didn't say the game was bad.
[00:42.99]I just said I'm not going to stream it.
[00:45.43]I didn't say, hey, by the way, Lisa the Painful sucks.
[00:50.87]See?
[00:51.19]Now clip that one.
[00:53.44]Now I fucked up your clip.

[01:10.88]Thanks, Zoidberg.
[01:12.14]Hey, you're very welcome.
[01:19.19]Come on.
[01:19.99]Everyone's saying Ratatouille.
[01:23.35]Well, here's the thing about Ratatouille.
[01:25.99]I promised I would play Ratatouille on the 28th.
[01:31.99]But the problem is I didn't buy it yet.
[01:37.55]I said I bought it.
[01:38.47]I said I owned it.
[01:40.42]But that was just... It was sitting in my cart.
[01:43.46]So technically I did own it.
[01:46.66]Temporarily speaking.
[01:51.03]Liar.
[01:52.43]He's a liar.
[01:55.57]That's not how it works.
[02:00.47]Anyways, so what we're gonna do today is cuz it's a mystery game Let me just change the title of something Let's put the title to... How do you spell that?
[02:16.20]How do you spell that word?
[02:19.02]Alright Yeah, today we're gonna be playing a... I don't know I can't spell this fucking word How do you spell this word?
[02:31.14]Is it one A?
[02:33.48]Two A's?
[02:42.24]Nah, I keep my fucking promises.
[02:46.63]Ratatouille!
[02:48.35]Is that loud?
[02:48.87]How loud was that?
[02:59.39]I told you guys I was going to play this on the 28th.
[03:04.63]I keep my promises.
[03:06.45]I keep my promises.
[03:07.71]I do.
[03:09.61]This is the, the original.
[03:12.35]There's like a bandaid over here.
[03:15.26]This is Disney Pixar presents Ratatouille, the video game from THQ.
[03:22.50]I actually looked this up a little bit.
[03:24.48]This game apparently is fucking terrible.
[03:27.71]Every review place gave this game like a four.
[03:30.45]The game sucks, apparently.
[03:31.53]I don't even know.
[03:31.97]I don't understand what the joke here is.
[03:33.39]I think two people said play Ratatouille, and I was like, okay, fine.
[03:38.75]Well, congratulations.
[03:42.95]You and your friends made me play a game on stream.
[03:49.12]Hey, Slalom, thanks for the five community subs, and Frlitty, thanks for five subs, too.
[03:54.24]I appreciate it.
[03:58.16]I unironically love this game.
[03:59.74]I don't know why I'm so excited.
[04:01.54]I'm like a lightning rod right now.
[04:03.13]I'm like ready to go.
[04:04.05]I don't know why.
[04:05.05]This game's gonna be fucking terrible.
[04:06.41]You know what's funny?
[04:12.18]I've never seen this movie.
[04:13.88]Let's go.
[04:16.32]Sign in and continue.
[04:17.28]Yeah, I don't... Whatever.
[04:18.10]Who cares?
[04:27.54]No storage device has been selected, you know?
[04:29.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:31.70]It's fine.
[04:32.34]On the hard drive.
[04:35.35]You've never seen... I've never seen this movie.
[04:37.27]I swear to God.
[04:38.83]Oh, I can go right to the cheats if I want to.
[04:40.93]Let's play the story.
[04:45.56]Yes, for those of you that don't know, I just hit... I just hit accept on the first generated name that Xbox gave me.
[04:53.97]I didn't even care.
[04:54.71]What the fuck would I even care?
[04:55.99]What, do I need to be Jerma985 on here?
[04:59.63]My Xbox 360?
[05:00.27]You're about to start a new game.
[05:04.09]Would you like to continue?
[05:04.69]Yes.
[05:05.35]Select the charms for access to other areas.
[05:08.71]Oh, collect the charms.
[05:12.21]Okay.
[05:18.70]This is David's Xbox.
[05:21.70]Well, it's my Xbox now.
[05:24.88]Got it from third-party sellers.
[05:27.38]Thanks, Dave.
[05:27.94]Okay, cool.
[05:31.22]So far, so good.
[05:32.94]Kind of looks like, um, David Pi√±ata a little.
[05:37.20]Does this follow the movie?
[05:38.24]Do I have to watch the movie if I beat this game?
[05:40.38]Yep, you're clean, pal.
[05:45.69]Move it along.
[05:48.83]Yes.
[05:52.26]It's just the movie.
[05:58.46]Hey, little brother.
[05:59.70]Are you finished yet?
[06:02.11]Just about, Dad.
[06:02.95]Can't a rat work in peace around here?
[06:05.07]Wait, is Patton Oswalt the rat in the movie?
[06:08.65]Because we got to get those charms collected before her nap time's over.
[06:13.98]He is?
[06:14.20]Oh shit.
[06:15.92]This sucks.
[06:16.42]Turn it off.
[06:16.78]No.
[06:32.33]You know how much of a pain in the ass I was to get this game?
[06:35.21]Just a pain in the ass.
[06:36.87]A real pain in the ass.
[06:38.29]Oh, I thought he was, like, smelling his butt.
[06:42.52]I'm not gonna fuck this on and skip it in the beginning cutscene.
[06:46.62]That's not happening today.
[06:48.80]You know how much shit people gave me to make sure I played this game on today's date?
[06:59.46]Alright, here we go.
[06:59.94]Welcome to Remy's home, Mabel's farm.
[07:02.08]Here you'll learn what your job is in the colony.
[07:04.03]Follow Emily.
[07:06.77]Okay.
[07:10.21]This is a charm.
[07:10.83]Collect as many as you can to unlock rewards.
[07:14.19]Press A to jump.
[07:15.97]Okay, double jump.
[07:16.65]Is this a double jump in the game?
[07:17.61]Alright, that's kind of cool.
[07:19.57]This is an edge grab.
[07:22.64]God, remember when Xbox used to just give you fucking achievements for no reason?
[07:25.46]They just didn't even care.
[07:26.28]Jumping on the first stuff.
[07:27.87]Tail swipe.
[07:28.31]Okay, so it's just an attack.
[07:51.20]Okay, is this game like an hour and a half long?
[07:53.64]Please say it is.
[07:55.24]Unlock bonus pack one.
[07:59.92]It's desync?
[08:03.02]Me or the game?
[08:03.68]What do you mean?
[08:04.95]It should be... It's the game?
[08:11.21]Hold on.
[08:14.25]The game sound is all fucked up.
[08:16.19]Hey, Jerma Slugpog, thanks for the five community subs.
[08:18.65]Thanks for being an emote that'll be deleted in about three months.
[08:23.03]Sound is early.
[08:24.35]Hold on, let me fix that.
[08:28.91]How's this sound?
[08:29.51]You tell me.
[08:30.21]Alright.
[08:32.61]That was good, right?
[08:37.72]Alright, let's keep going.
[08:43.56]Slug Pog.
[08:44.56]I don't even know why it's activated.
[08:46.02]It's chili peppers?
[08:47.58]Are you cooking this game or are you just walking around and collecting coins?
[08:52.08]Ugh.
[09:07.84]Oh shit, this guy's dead.
[09:09.98]Go pull this to help him!
[09:11.66]Pick up an upris B. Okay, and then drop it here.
[09:13.06]Chili peppers can be used to destroy certain objects in the world to defeat enemies.
[09:17.12]Tail swipe and get away.
[09:44.10]Okay, cool.
[09:45.94]It's a little platforming game.
[09:47.90]Like every single video game that comes out that has a license.
[09:51.64]Some objects in the world will have a glow outline.
[09:53.66]This means that Remy was... What do I do?
[09:55.06]I'm convinced that every single movie and TV game that came out from like 1998 to 2010...
[10:11.03]It was all the same engine, same video game.
[10:13.13]They just put different assets sort of in the game world.
[10:16.20]It's all the same exact game.
[10:18.52]Oh, I can smell.
[10:21.44]Wrong?
[10:21.68]It's not wrong.
[10:24.28]They just shared the source code with every single movie that was within six months of release.
[10:34.13]They changed the coin in this game to like the cheese in another game.
[10:37.33]The cheese turns into like a star in the other one.
[10:44.46]Toy Story, yeah.
[10:45.62]Toy Story had like fucking action figures instead of coins.
[10:52.85]You can find out where to go next by using your sense of smell.
[10:59.09]Oh, nice.
[10:59.53]I'm so glad that there's like a fable tube.
[11:01.75]Just walk this way, idiot button.
[11:09.21]I almost fucked that up.
[11:11.71]Hold A to compress it?
[11:18.64]Oh, I see.
[11:19.12]Speaking of which, Jerma should play Dead Space 1 and 2 for October.
[11:26.05]I actually might do that.
[11:27.53]Whenever you come to a wall or a pipe, just jump towards it and grab on.
[11:32.23]Like this.
[11:33.83]Why am I playing this game right now?
[11:36.51]There's no reason to be playing this.
[11:38.90]There's so many things I can be playing right now.
[11:41.52]Day long.
[11:42.70]Meet you at the top, little brother.
[11:47.67]Grab, jump and press V. Cool.
[11:52.01]Okay, how long is the game?
[11:53.09]Somebody said it was... Oh, that's health.
[11:56.03]I don't have full health?
[11:57.11]This game is 40 hours.
[11:59.39]It's 20 plus hours.
[11:59.89]No, it is not.
[12:00.23]The only way this game is 20 plus hours is if level 1 through 10 was copy and pasted 30 times.
[12:18.34]A repel object will work on all swarms.
[12:28.07]Do I get to use the food?
[12:29.25]Please tell me I get to cook.
[12:31.29]You can't make a Ratatouille game and not have cooking.
[12:34.25]I don't want to just walk around and spray bugs.
[12:35.94]Did I die?
[12:41.70]Oh, okay.
[12:44.44]I was just waiting for like Dark Souls text to pop up and go like... The underbark.
[12:49.08]Alright, now what?
[13:00.07]Give me more instructions.
[13:01.03]Chili peppers can be used, yeah.
[13:08.88]Oh god, he's playing this.
[13:10.48]Yeah, I am.
[13:12.67]Because when I tell you I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it regardless of how detrimental it is.
[13:16.43]Let me get the strawberries.
[13:22.02]I don't hate it yet.
[13:22.90]I don't hate it yet.
[13:23.44]I kind of like it.
[13:24.06]I need another chili pepper.
[13:29.50]I know what to do.
[13:30.38]Enough here.
[13:39.77]Okay, can I ask a question?
[13:42.23]Is the reason why everybody wants me to play this game, regardless of how bad it is, because this is everybody's favorite movie here?
[13:48.77]That's why, right?
[13:49.93]And you overlook how shitty this game is because you love the movie so much.
[13:53.18]All you care about is the characters talking.
[13:55.24]Right?
[13:57.20]You're watching like a reunion show.
[14:02.38]You know that's kind of tired and old.
[14:05.60]But it's still your favorite character, so you like it.
[14:09.71]Cat has really bad taste.
[14:10.65]Use the ball.
[14:11.71]Alright, jump on the ball and press B. And you can squash the bugs.
[14:33.29]There are surfaces in the world that will hurt you.
[14:35.87]I can get on... Okay, I can use the ball to jump on surfaces that will hurt me like poison.
[14:41.65]Plus one letter grade coming up.
[14:44.53]Does this count?
[14:48.23]No, it doesn't count.
[14:49.33]The car actually has to turn.
[14:53.54]Oh, that's too bad.
[14:56.60]When do I get to grab onto the guy's hair and like, fuck with his brain?
[15:00.34]Like, pull his hairs and like, give him a headache.
[15:02.71]When does that happen?
[15:03.31]Graphics are actually pretty good.
[15:05.19]Yeah, they're pretty- they are.
[15:07.37]They're not bad.
[15:08.05]When does this come out?
[15:27.06]Jump towards any highlighted point and press B. Use the left stick to balance.
[15:34.71]Oh, okay.
[15:35.35]Like Tony Hawk manual.
[15:38.25]Easy.
[15:39.29]Just play Tony Hawk instead.
[15:41.45]No!
[15:41.51]I'm playing Ratatouille!
[16:00.04]Everybody thought that I was not playing this today, too.
[16:05.66]Everyone was convinced that I didn't buy it.
[16:08.31]Balance, what the fuck are you doing?
[16:13.25]No, no, guys, of course I did.
[16:16.95]Whoa.
[16:17.93]Sorry, I don't think you can fail this.
[16:18.91]This is not failable.
[16:24.20]Alright, cool, we're good.
[16:25.40]To climb a pipe, climb it.
[16:29.12]Alright.
[16:30.10]I'm interested so far.
[16:31.46]I'm interested.
[16:44.48]Check this out, Remy.
[16:46.19]Grab it, pull back, and release to launch yourself.
[16:49.01]It's a flinger?
[16:49.97]Now, watch the master soar away.
[16:55.72]A fucking eagle just scoops him out of the air with his claws.
[16:59.45]If you use the ratapult, stand underneath it and hold V. Sorry, Remmy, but you need 20 charms to proceed.
[17:17.85]What?
[17:21.08]Did I get softlocked in the tutorial?
[17:23.02]What do you mean I need 20 charms?
[17:30.08]I got paywalled?
[17:33.52]How did that even happen?
[17:38.92]How did that happen?
[17:45.18]What?
[17:46.48]What did I do wrong?
[17:47.27]I just followed his instructions.
[17:51.65]I missed the coins.
[17:53.35]I did?
[17:53.75]I thought I picked them all up.
[17:57.71]The water pump handle is stuck.
[17:59.11]Try jumping on it for a reward.
[18:01.71]Ooh.
[18:07.31]There's gonna be coins in here, right?
[18:09.91]That'd be.
[18:16.90]Fuck.
[18:23.38]I thought they would just collect.
[18:24.36]Yeah, I didn't know I needed them.
[18:25.40]I guess I need them.
[18:34.37]Am I good?
[18:35.43]Oh, that's a coin!
[18:38.11]One?
[18:39.65]Wait a minute, I need ten more coins.
[18:45.51]Ten.
[18:47.41]Did I just run past them?
[18:55.04]What do you mean five?
[18:55.92]Ooh.
[19:01.49]There's a charm hidden in the stump.
[19:02.65]Blow up the box.
[19:03.39]Oh, I get it.
[19:03.80]No, no, no.
[19:04.14]I was supposed to lose here.
[19:07.96]This is just a tutorial to explore and learn and figure out what happened.
[19:12.96]You'll need to use the rat on a ball to reach this charm.
[19:16.24]Right.
[19:16.53]Okay.
[19:16.83]Where's the rat on a ball?
[19:17.63]There's a ball.
[19:18.03]Is there a sprint button?
[19:23.45]You know, Remy, if you just used all four of your hands, you could probably go so much faster than this.
[19:32.21]Alright, there's this one.
[19:35.57]You can dash?
[19:36.69]Oh shit, you can.
[19:37.31]What did I just do?
[19:40.02]I failed it?
[19:45.60]No, I didn't.
[19:48.50]Oh, that's fast.
[19:51.36]This is literally a plot point.
[19:54.57]Collecting coins?
[20:00.73]I've never seen the movie.
[20:04.35]I know I'm going to piss off a lot of people when I say this, but I always saw Ratatouille as a filler Pixar movie.
[20:10.59]Like it was, oh yeah, they came out with like three or four every year or two.
[20:13.39]And it was like, oh, this is one of the filler ones.
[20:14.73]I don't need to watch it.
[20:16.15]I'm just, I'm not saying it's a bad movie.
[20:17.87]I'm just saying that's how I saw it when it first came out.
[20:22.55]Oh shit, what was this?
[20:26.09]Take that back.
[20:28.16]Look, I'm not saying that that's accurate.
[20:29.82]I'm just saying that's how I felt.
[20:30.80]What do I do with this?
[20:37.48]You know how Pixar and Disney came out with a shitload of 3D animated movies?
[20:41.29]There was like 30 of them over the course of 10 years.
[20:45.27]Some of them I was like, I don't know, I guess it's alright.
[20:47.29]I didn't hate the movies or anything.
[20:52.81]Apologize for that.
[20:53.63]I'm sorry!
[20:54.45]No, apologize for what?
[20:55.87]I didn't say anything.
[20:57.84]Oh shit.
[20:59.60]Find the valve and fix the sprinkler.
[21:02.70]What is this bullshit?
[21:03.48]I don't want to do this.
[21:06.72]Wait, chili pepper.
[21:11.92]There's one down here, right?
[21:16.74]You're a Disney hater.
[21:20.95]Look, once they announce the live-action remake of Ratatouille, then I'll care.
[21:24.37]How's that sound?
[21:29.05]Oh, you actually can do that.
[21:32.73]What?
[21:35.77]What just happened?
[21:36.31]Did I die?
[21:40.94]That was a trap.
[21:42.34]Alright, I need more coins.
[21:46.10]I got that one.
[21:49.52]I got that one.
[21:50.20]Alright, I get that one right there.
[21:55.92]Did I have to go trap?
[21:56.70]Yeah, what the hell was that?
[22:02.71]Alright, what do you want to see for a live action remake for Disney?
[22:12.79]Nothing.
[22:14.95]That's true.
[22:15.77]Who cares?
[22:16.39]That's right.
[22:20.66]Who fucking cares?
[22:21.64]Okay, once they made the third one in a row, it was like, alright, I don't care anymore.
[22:27.38]This is fucking stupid.
[22:29.66]You want cars?
[22:30.58]Okay, that would be actually pretty cool.
[22:33.17]I need to find a valve.
[22:37.45]You would have my attention with the... Oh, valve.
[22:43.76]Alright, wait, what happens if a rat fights a squirrel?
[22:57.27]Imagine looking out your window and seeing this in the backyard.
[22:59.05]What do you do?
[23:01.85]I would freak out.
[23:02.39]I'd be like, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[23:03.43]I would just go out and start clapping my hands.
[23:11.72]Really?
[23:12.34]Sucker punch.
[23:12.96]You fucking piece of shit.
[23:14.20]Nice sucker punch.
[23:16.06]I kicked your ass for like five straight minutes and then you're gonna go when my back is turned?
[23:19.34]Typical fucking squirrel move.
[23:20.62]Stop.
[23:22.53]Leave me the fuck alone.
[23:24.35]Give me this thing.
[23:28.13]Alright, come on.
[23:28.73]Come here.
[23:32.39]Get over here.
[23:40.97]Stop it!
[23:42.55]Hey!
[23:49.13]That's so stupid.
[23:50.05]Alright, get me out of this.
[23:56.49]Blow up the squirrel.
[23:59.53]That's evil.
[24:02.51]I'm gonna blow up the squirrel.
[24:08.75]Alright, so what the hell does that do?
[24:13.92]Yeah, well, let me get up there then.
[24:15.36]Oh.
[24:17.90]Oh, I think... Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[24:27.61]Um, can you... Why is it not spraying me?
[24:34.62]What?
[24:37.36]It feels like jump on these.
[24:46.43]This is fucking dumb.
[24:51.54]Do I really need to get more coins?
[24:53.42]What a tutorial this is.
[24:54.40]Alright.
[24:57.04]I didn't mean... I think these are friendly.
[24:59.22]Are you friendly?
[25:00.70]Yeah, I just have to... No.
[25:01.98]Oh, yeah.
[25:02.42]Of course not.
[25:05.10]Go get the chili bomb.
[25:11.54]Is this just what it's like when we're not looking?
[25:14.71]Like, ever read, like, Toy Story and shit?
[25:17.45]When Andy's not home, the toys have a bunch of fun and they play games with each other.
[25:21.98]In the animal world, when the humans aren't looking, they kill each other, they eat each other, they rip each other's heads off.
[25:33.97]Everyone thinks, oh yeah, when the animals are together, they talk and have fun adventures.
[25:37.95]No, no, the rat literally gouges out this little chick's eyes.
[25:40.96]With his hands.
[25:42.50]And then eats his brain.
[25:44.52]They can't make a movie about that, though.
[25:46.82]Alright, what the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[25:47.88]Is this something I can bounce on?
[25:57.10]Do I need to roll in here with the rollie?
[26:01.37]Wait, I see this thing up there.
[26:04.23]How am I a psycho?
[26:04.95]That's real.
[26:05.91]That's real life.
[26:07.49]That's what happens.
[26:10.61]Like, in real life, these two would not have a conversation about their taxes.
[26:14.41]The dove would come down.
[26:15.37]He'd get tail whipped.
[26:17.91]He'd get bitten in the face.
[26:20.15]The rat would lose its tail.
[26:21.25]This other rat would come over and start eating the other rat, even though they're both rats.
[26:39.17]No, it isn't Jeremy.
[26:39.89]You have to go outside.
[26:40.87]Come on.
[26:44.75]There's a hole over here.
[26:45.51]Hold on.
[26:47.49]Oh, there's a flinger.
[26:50.06]Play chess?
[27:00.82]Holy shit.
[27:01.96]Wait, I need to play chess.
[27:05.26]I had better wash up before I cook.
[27:07.94]Oh, my God.
[27:08.95]There's like a thousand coins up here.
[27:17.29]You collected weight to glide.
[27:18.55]I can glide.
[27:19.19]How do I glide?
[27:20.57]Just told me I can glide.
[27:22.36]Wait a minute.
[27:25.72]I can do a Mary Poppins.
[27:32.30]Oh, cool.
[27:36.21]I got 20 charms.
[27:39.49]I gotta go find Eddie.
[27:50.02]Rats.
[27:52.03]You looked in, by the way, you looked in your backyard to see this many rats.
[27:56.14]Eh.
[27:57.38]Probably time to actually put the trash out.
[28:00.32]Rather than skip it three weeks in a row.
[28:02.12]Because you, oh fuck, I forgot.
[28:03.52]And it's like already like, it's like already 8am.
[28:06.53]I can't get the fucking trash out now.
[28:08.11]I can already hear the truck coming down the street.
[28:13.71]What, am I going to go out there in my underwear?
[28:14.99]Like, hold on a second!
[28:19.29]I've thought about it before, but then you can't.
[28:21.00]You just can't do it.
[28:31.24]Yeah, and then you go over in your head.
[28:33.35]Is it embarrassing for me to go out there with messy hair and underwear and like a pair of socks or not have my trash out?
[28:41.99]Oh, fuck.
[28:43.27]I don't know.
[28:44.72]What if I get caught on somebody's like ring cam?
[28:48.90]I'll wait till next week.
[28:51.08]Well, I need your help.
[28:53.93]I'm getting huge Bugleberry vibes from that guy right now.
[28:57.60]Huge.
[29:29.96]A shotgun?
[29:31.04]Oh, I thought the old lady was shooting a shotgun out the... She has a shotgun!
[29:37.80]It is a shotgun!
[29:42.26]Holy shit, does this happen in the movie?
[29:47.41]Does this happen in the movie?
[29:49.63]Oh shit, FPS mode.
[29:57.47]Run, Remi, run!
[30:01.49]Why does the lady have a gas mask on and a shotgun?
[30:11.48]This actually does happen in the movie.
[30:13.58]Holy shit.
[30:21.16]Oh, okay, I have to actually run.
[30:25.66]Pick your step and stuff.
[30:29.81]Get it next time.
[30:34.15]Okay.
[30:36.02]Go faster.
[30:37.18]Step in this.
[30:38.74]Okay, it doesn't matter.
[30:39.46]Go.
[30:39.56]I'm trying to get her to step in the mouse trap.
[30:43.18]Wait, that doesn't do anything.
[30:50.95]Go.
[30:51.03]Okay, cool.
[30:51.37]Those mouse traps are for me.
[30:59.06]Didn't even touch that one, that was horseshit.
[31:05.73]God, now what?
[31:06.91]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[31:21.88]Oh, you- No!
[31:22.76]You lose speed!
[31:24.02]I'm dead!
[31:25.38]Sheik, being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[31:30.52]Imagine seeing grandma.
[31:31.88]Yeah, this game so far has been book out your window and be surprised.
[31:39.24]There's an old lady outside my window shooting at a moving book with a gun and a gas mask.
[31:50.38]www.hazello.com.
[31:52.60]New apartments in your area that are available now.
[31:55.24]Let's take a look.
[32:09.94]well at least I'm a good cook I got shot by the gun so you're telling me that there's a point in the movie where an old lady with a gas mask on is shooting at the rat with a shotgun you don't want to see this as a live-action movie
[32:36.75]Sure?
[32:37.73]Why didn't they do this one first?
[32:43.21]What did they do first?
[32:43.91]What was the first live-action remake when we were so excited about it?
[32:55.28]Shit, I missed it again.
[33:03.34]Cinderella?
[33:04.70]Oh, come the fuck on.
[33:05.98]Really?
[33:06.36]Get it next time.
[33:06.98]That thing is just in the way.
[33:08.32]That thing is just in the way.
[33:09.38]It wasn't Cinderella.
[33:11.80]Cinderella was like a daytime movie.
[33:14.40]Talk about like a real remade movie in a theater.
[33:17.90]It wasn't Cinderella.
[33:21.35]That was like a TV movie.
[33:24.13]Yeah.
[33:26.27]A lepison?
[33:27.73]Was it?
[33:35.71]Fuck, I'm looking at chat.
[33:36.88]Somebody said Tarzan?
[33:38.98]No, that was also like a TV movie.
[33:41.46]Made for TV.
[33:42.06]Cinderella was a made-for-TV movie.
[33:43.42]It wasn't in theaters.
[33:50.77]Stop looking at chat!
[33:52.91]Okay, honest to God, I'm going to beat this.
[34:05.14]I'm going to be quiet for a minute.
[34:06.10]I can't be one of those people that plays like a three hour long licensed movie video game.
[34:12.95]It takes like three hours to read, but I spend like 40.
[34:16.77]And I walked into that like on purpose somehow.
[34:19.13]And that one too, I don't even know how.
[34:20.27]I have muscle memory to do a fall joke.
[34:24.04]I swear to God, I don't even know why.
[34:25.92]I didn't do anything.
[34:26.96]I was trying to win.
[34:36.45]I'm ahead.
[34:39.89]Okay, I just tried to jump, but it didn't do shit.
[34:45.72]Jump!
[34:51.34]I'm like, there's no batteries in this fucking thing.
[34:56.79]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[35:01.67]Go!
[35:01.97]How big is Grandma's front yard?
[35:18.22]Oh, out of ammo.
[35:19.02]Sorry, Grandma.
[35:24.18]Sand Raider?
[35:26.34]Boom, baby!
[35:29.78]Collected a health container.
[35:30.88]Oh, so I got extra health?
[35:41.56]No reloading in the middle of combat.
[35:51.97]After the sewer, it's time to cook.
[35:53.41]Oh, this looks open and annoying.
[35:54.55]Alright, so does he read the cookbook now, or does he already know how to cook?
[36:14.13]And why does the rat already know how to cook?
[36:16.87]Where's his skillet?
[36:17.51]Where's his fucking burner?
[36:18.75]Where's his microwave?
[36:25.08]But how?
[36:26.90]You're not real.
[36:29.44]Why am I talking to an illustration from a book?
[36:32.56]Excusez-moi.
[36:33.73]I am Chef Auguste Gusteau.
[36:36.73]Excuse me.
[36:37.43]The ghost of Chef Bugleberry.
[36:39.97]Silence.
[36:41.57]And look there.
[36:46.29]don't you feel like if you grabbed the tip of his head and pulled him up strongly you'd make him look like a normal person oh what are you gross
[37:11.60]Feeding chum?
[37:13.16]To dogs on the street?
[37:14.50]This isn't in the movie.
[37:15.36]I think I can handle that.
[37:42.28]Turn on captions?
[37:43.30]Is it available?
[37:46.92]To find a mission, the compass can tell you where to find a mission marker.
[37:51.34]Oh, no.
[37:51.90]If you wish to begin a mission, you must start with the mission marker.
[37:57.22]I thought a mini mission beacon.
[38:00.28]What fun.
[38:00.90]Why don't you try a mini mission?
[38:03.86]Timed challenge.
[38:04.88]You want?
[38:06.28]Sure.
[38:07.40]Great.
[38:08.44]Two minutes to do something.
[38:10.04]I guess to follow him around.
[38:13.11]Alright, let's go.
[38:17.55]Timed chaos build.
[38:18.39]Do you remember 985?
[38:19.85]It's kind of slow.
[38:32.82]It's actually a name of a small like three part series I did.
[38:36.21]I thought it was going to be a huge hit.
[38:37.39]I thought that was going to be a huge hit for the stream.
[38:46.04]Minecraft was just getting traction.
[38:47.96]Everybody loved it.
[38:53.28]Didn't really work out so well.
[38:55.00]In my head, it was a little different.
[38:56.16]Wait, I need to collect these to get a mission.
[38:58.66]What's this fucking gate?
[38:59.52]This time gate shit.
[39:00.34]Currency gate.
[39:17.42]Oh, fuck.
[39:18.04]Wait.
[39:29.71]Why am I so heavy on the right?
[39:34.45]No!
[39:39.37]He's getting too far away!
[39:41.87]Stay- Oh no, you've lost the race!
[39:44.46]Let's start over!
[39:46.51]Oh, it's a race.
[39:47.99]I thought I was just following him.
[39:53.09]But I kind of need to see where he goes.
[39:55.27]I don't know where to go.
[39:56.07]Okay, you know when a really, really super pro player jumps off the edge, hangs on the edge, jumps off the edge, hangs on the edge just because they're bored and they know every inch of every second of the game?
[40:13.68]Pretend I was doing that.
[40:20.35]It's going to be a long stream.
[40:21.91]It is not.
[40:22.87]It's not going to be a long stream.
[40:25.59]I have a finite amount of time I'm willing to give to Ratatouille, the official licensed video game stream.
[40:35.28]I don't know what that is.
[40:36.26]I'm not sure if it's 20 minutes.
[40:38.84]Well, it's been 40, so that's wrong.
[40:40.90]Alright, I'll get it right here.
[40:47.06]It's been longer than that.
[40:54.40]Alright, come on.
[40:54.90]I can do it.
[40:55.29]Stop going to the right.
[41:00.82]Alright, don't fuck this up and I win.
[41:02.54]What the fuck is going on?
[41:20.53]Wait.
[41:20.73]I'm gonna do this.
[41:21.21]I'm gonna do this.
[41:21.75]Get it!
[41:21.99]I win.
[41:22.13]It does sound like Yoda.
[41:22.87]It kinda does.
[41:49.84]Not really, though.
[41:51.04]He did for a second.
[41:54.80]Soupy assistance.
[41:55.72]Alright, cool.
[41:56.64]Yes.
[41:58.94]I'm ready.
[41:59.56]I'm ready to have fun now.
[42:01.26]Here comes an actual cooking mission.
[42:05.30]Soupy mission.
[42:06.08]I mean, he kind of does.
[42:07.61]He did one word.
[42:08.91]It was like... Everything else was not Yoda at all, but I get it.
[42:23.26]The soup is terrible.
[42:24.30]Use the spices to fix the soup.
[42:26.70]Knock the cheese that is on the top shelf into the bucket below.
[42:29.56]Complete your tasks and don't let the chefs catch you.
[42:35.05]This is a hidey hole.
[42:36.99]If you're spotted by a human, you need to run inside of a hole.
[42:40.07]Alright, so let's... Oh, it's the spices.
[42:47.15]Okay.
[42:47.57]What if I've dumped
[42:53.51]It seems like that rat's gonna kill me.
[43:04.27]Oh, fuck.
[43:04.81]I broke it.
[43:10.38]Oh, they have to go over here.
[43:11.16]Okay.
[43:12.76]What if I just... Imagine that.
[43:16.86]Imagine jump-scaring the guy on purpose.
[43:22.28]You know you can fix that soup.
[43:24.27]What are you waiting for?
[43:25.29]It is kind of like Yoda, you're right.
[43:29.85]Same noise I just made.
[43:30.77]You say I can't even boil water?
[43:36.86]Fucking useless.
[43:40.84]I can do that, and I'm stupid.
[43:43.08]Alright, where's the next... Oh, here.
[43:49.25]I can't even boil water.
[43:53.21]Alright, come on, ding.
[43:58.03]I did.
[43:58.31]He just saw me.
[44:05.64]He just looked right at me.
[44:08.30]Alright, what's this?
[44:08.90]There's two more?
[44:09.46]Alright, there's two.
[44:11.02]Alright, there's one across.
[44:14.64]Okay, I gotta climb up and then go down.
[44:15.85]Okay, there's one over there.
[44:20.49]Blind him.
[44:22.32]You know you can fix that soon.
[44:24.38]What are you waiting for?
[44:26.00]You've been detected.
[44:28.04]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[44:35.91]What?
[44:42.93]He's that much of a psycho?
[44:44.27]Yeah, that's it.
[44:47.01]Okay, so can I go from here?
[44:50.43]Can I jump from here?
[44:55.18]Okay, I know where to go.
[44:57.58]How long do you stay over there for?
[45:00.71]Oh, up.
[45:01.17]Hold on.
[45:01.63]There's one over here.
[45:05.23]It's an invisible wall, of course.
[45:06.61]Oh, and this is bad.
[45:07.35]This is really bad.
[45:08.63]This is really bad.
[45:21.08]Okay, I'm alright.
[45:22.08]I'm okay, I'm okay.
[45:22.64]Am I stuck down here?
[45:23.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, in the hole.
[45:50.18]Okay.
[45:50.86]How do I get that one?
[45:55.23]What the fuck are you doing?
[45:58.01]Alright, there it is.
[46:00.45]The cream.
[46:01.03]I got it.
[46:01.23]Alright, there's only one more.
[46:03.11]Alright, now backstab him.
[46:24.00]This guy's name is Linguini?
[46:30.20]Like Paul Linguini?
[46:34.68]What the fuck?
[46:39.48]No, turn around, turn around, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[46:41.29]Camera, camera, camera, camera, camera, camera.
[46:44.21]I've never seen, I've never seen the movie.
[46:50.96]I have not seen this movie.
[46:53.74]I guess I could go that way.
[46:56.48]Which one should I get?
[47:04.20]The one up top or the one down here?
[47:05.33]I'm going to get the one down here.
[47:07.11]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[47:17.78]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[47:19.60]Hurry, hurry.
[47:20.96]Hurry.
[47:22.04]Hurry, hurry.
[47:22.90]You know you can fix that soon.
[47:24.50]Stop.
[47:25.02]Shut up, Yoda.
[47:28.71]I don't need this force ghost to tell me what to do every time.
[47:31.25]Alright, there it is.
[47:34.17]Got it.
[47:35.55]Four out of four.
[47:38.09]Now what?
[47:38.75]I wouldn't love a piece of cheese right about now.
[47:44.34]Now what?
[47:45.34]Quickly, find a place to hide.
[47:51.16]You need the last one regardless?
[47:52.76]You do?
[47:53.12]I need the cheese.
[47:57.74]Oh, bullshit.
[47:59.00]Is that the cheese over there?
[48:09.38]Is this the cheese up here?
[48:10.38]Alright, hold on.
[48:12.89]I gotta distract him.
[48:14.33]I'm gonna go- What's that timer?
[48:22.41]Alright, we're good.
[48:23.33]What can I tell you?
[48:25.69]I love good food.
[48:27.73]Soupy assistance mission completed.
[48:36.18]You know.
[48:41.92]Rip out the chef's tongue.
[48:43.38]Psycho.
[48:44.50]You.
[48:44.94]That's you.
[48:52.15]That guy's gonna unlock hidden bonus material?
[48:55.87]Oh, well done, Remy.
[48:57.19]Well done.
[48:58.71]Perhaps you can also use your nose to find other rats.
[49:03.63]Let's see.
[49:04.15]Dark, smelly, wet.
[49:05.94]The perfect place for a colony of rats.
[49:08.12]I thought he had a condo or something.
[49:11.48]Is that the end of the movie?
[49:12.46]He gets like a condo with the guy.
[49:15.24]You're back home?
[49:16.90]We thought we'd never see you again.
[49:19.42]Wait till Dad finds out.
[49:21.91]Remi.
[49:23.47]Thank goodness you're alive.
[49:25.45]Dad, it's great to see you too.
[49:27.63]But what are you doing here?
[49:30.16]We're here because of your harebrained scheme back at the cottage.
[49:34.74]It's hard to move a village, you know?
[49:37.74]I'm sorry, Dad, but I'm here now and I want to help.
[49:41.03]How do you know that but not his name?
[49:43.77]Follow me and we'll get to work.
[49:45.62]Guys, the main character that's an animal or some mutant or alien or something that lives at the end of the movie with the other main character in a weird kind of like odd couple scenario, that's half of every fucking movie that's ever existed.
[50:00.86]Every Disney Pixar or animated movie that ends like that, always.
[50:04.22]That happens in Bee Movie.
[50:06.40]Remember Bee Movie?
[50:08.04]He moves in with her at the end of the movie.
[50:10.38]Oh, it would be so nice if you could speak to your father.
[50:13.49]Finally.
[50:15.03]Oh, okay, okay.
[50:17.14]Does it happen in B-movie?
[50:17.98]Yeah, it does.
[50:18.46]Alright, let's sniff.
[50:27.61]Ah, what's that?
[50:29.25]Trash.
[50:36.85]Okay, when there's food, any food.
[50:39.71]If I order like takeout or something, or if I bring back something from cooking, you look over the side of where Otto's bed is and he goes, he goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[50:51.79]It's the cutest thing in the world.
[50:52.67]I kind of missed the force ghost guy.
[51:07.23]Where should I go now?
[51:09.63]I'm just gonna go this way.
[51:20.64]There he is, okay.
[51:24.60]Thank you.
[51:29.14]He's still around.
[51:31.74]He's gonna be a presence the whole game, isn't he?
[51:36.32]Alright, why can I smell my dad?
[51:41.63]Did I walk by him?
[51:54.32]Jumping is fun.
[51:55.00]Hmm, that's about it.
[51:59.75]Okay, I just I just put my hand up to my face and like did like a like I'm gonna talk into the microphone and I like touched my water on like my fucking hands and all and I got it on my face.
[52:10.26]I didn't like that at all.
[52:11.68]I hated that.
[52:12.18]I'm not doing that anymore.
[52:13.12]Don't like lean in and make like a here I'm leaning in doing a thing.
[52:17.16]Doesn't mean I'm gonna get water on my face.
[52:18.52]No, I burnt this thing off.
[52:19.81]It's fine.
[52:24.30]Shit, there's like 8,000 people there that just happened to say that.
[52:26.48]Like 2,000 of you know what I'm talking about.
[52:28.16]That's a funny joke.
[52:31.37]She's right here.
[52:33.59]How do I talk to my dad?
[52:35.89]Harris.
[52:39.11]Learn more about what's there.
[52:40.27]They feed dogs a bucket of scraps in the courtyard everyday.
[52:44.72]We need to get a hold of that bucket.
[52:47.84]Scare the dogs away from the courtyard.
[52:49.26]Find a coin in the bird's nest and bring it down to the courtyard.
[52:54.20]They're the gutter of clutter.
[52:57.60]I did that one.
[52:59.26]What, three light bulbs?
[52:59.88]Oh, God.
[53:00.12]I gotta do all these tasks?
[53:02.96]It is one cooking mission.
[53:20.29]Next game, please.
[53:21.61]I can't.
[53:23.43]I can't.
[53:26.45]I can't.
[53:26.83]Dude, the next game is... Oh, look.
[53:33.44]There's one already right here.
[53:34.90]Where's this one?
[53:36.36]Oh, no, no, no.
[53:37.44]I don't want to go back to the stink home.
[53:42.76]I already did that one.
[53:44.48]Oh, shit.
[53:44.96]A cat.
[53:51.19]Don't be afraid.
[53:52.07]Just go in.
[53:58.03]Now, I've got a bunch of Xbox 360 and Xbox games back here.
[54:01.52]Whatever it is, it's gonna be on Xbox.
[54:04.12]I'll pull something out.
[54:05.02]No!
[54:05.34]I'm playing Ratatouille right now.
[54:08.54]Talk about that later.
[54:14.80]Get me.
[54:16.81]Grab something?
[54:18.41]What's the point of this?
[54:21.51]What's the light bulb one?
[54:23.53]Oh, the dog.
[54:24.01]Scared the dog's way.
[54:24.65]I got it.
[54:28.36]What's going on?
[54:30.26]Why am I doing this?
[54:36.50]Stream the movie.
[54:38.36]I can't stream the movie of Rastatoni.
[54:48.22]How do I get up here?
[54:54.52]Fuck, there's something else here.
[54:58.66]Stream rationing.
[55:00.98]No.
[55:03.30]Hey!
[55:05.06]That cat just threw a fucking rock.
[55:12.86]This floating thing is called a mission marker.
[55:14.96]Alright, that's all I wanted.
[55:18.95]Here balls you.
[55:24.52]X-Men Origins waiting room.
[55:26.24]No, you can't.
[55:27.22]Listen.
[55:27.46]I bet you you're the same guy that said Ratatouille waiting room with a ResidentSleeper on it like six weeks ago.
[55:35.83]I bet you you're the same guy.
[55:39.10]I was playing a game, I was doing something, and I saw, like, ResidentSleeper, ResidentSleeper, Ratatouille for Xbox 360, Waiting Room, ResidentSleeper.
[55:45.73]And now I'm doing it, and here you are again.
[55:48.63]You can't keep moving the goalposts.
[55:50.69]I'm here.
[55:50.99]Find a way to scare the dog.
[56:01.09]Yeah, guess what?
[56:01.57]When I play X-Men Origins, Wolverine, whatever it is, the same person's gonna come in.
[56:06.33]They're gonna say, oh, man, you're fucking feeding frenzy for PopCap.com waiting room.
[56:11.77]It's not a bad idea.
[56:13.67]I'll take that idea soon.
[56:14.61]Alright, hold on.
[56:21.14]I gotta wait.
[56:21.52]This looks kind of hard.
[56:25.28]Find something to scare the dog quickly.
[56:28.30]Oh, well.
[56:31.54]What was it?
[56:31.96]Wasn't there acid?
[56:32.70]Saw a waiting room.
[56:34.92]Stop it!
[56:35.10]Find your way to the other side of the alleyway.
[56:36.84]Yeah.
[56:36.98]Boom beach waiting room?
[56:37.80]Isn't that like an iPhone game?
[56:38.68]Alright, we're good.
[57:00.58]What do I do about this?
[57:08.73]Oh, shit.
[57:10.15]I know.
[57:10.41]It's a steam valve.
[57:13.53]Fuck it, God.
[57:14.29]Waiting room.
[57:16.33]Jack and Dexter waiting room.
[57:17.55]Okay.
[57:18.11]I'm going to have to stop you on that one.
[57:20.60]I'm playing Jack and Dexter right now.
[57:23.96]I may as well.
[57:24.46]I'm playing the same game.
[57:34.73]I'm going now.
[57:35.55]It's not timed.
[57:37.21]Oh, shit.
[57:42.37]Wait.
[57:46.12]I'm going to fuck this up.
[57:46.90]No, I'm not.
[57:47.20]I'm good.
[57:48.68]Scared the dog.
[57:49.38]Knock off a tomato can.
[57:51.90]Peggle waiting room.
[57:52.60]I play Peggle on stream.
[57:55.86]Already done that, man.
[57:59.40]And why did you turn around?
[58:00.24]What was that for?
[58:06.31]more peggle.
[58:07.29]Nobody, you don't want more peggle.
[58:08.63]I know you don't.
[58:12.13]I extreme fevered almost every single level the last time I played it.
[58:14.91]What more can I do to impress you?
[58:17.81]You can't get like 20 extreme fevers in a row and then be like, yeah, I mean, you could do better than that.
[58:22.18]No, I can't.
[58:23.92]I cleared five levels in a row with one ball.
[58:28.34]I can't ever replicate that again.
[58:29.84]Find something to scare that dog quickly.
[58:37.36]What the hell?
[58:39.98]Oh shit, that was cool.
[58:42.34]What's down here?
[58:48.73]Oh, this is just a way to get back up here.
[58:52.57]A permanent environmental upgrade?
[59:06.47]I'm a one ball.
[59:08.45]Omega low.
[59:13.59]I'm trying to understand where you're coming from with this one.
[59:16.96]Club Penguin.
[59:22.38]No, you don't want... Okay.
[59:24.62]The special request video games.
[59:26.26]I think a lot of you have to understand...
[59:31.45]Okay, the special request games... It's really... It's like... Okay, right now... There are 82... Almost 8,300 people here right now.
[59:41.88]Four of you really want me to continue to play this.
[59:44.36]And you're like... You got your popcorn ready.
[59:45.96]You were like, holy fuck.
[59:46.88]I can't believe you're playing this.
[59:47.76]It's my favorite game ever when I was a kid.
[59:50.56]And that... And I'm doing that for you.
[59:53.12]You'll get yours.
[59:54.19]Eventually, you will.
[59:56.73]You will.
[59:58.36]You're gonna say, like, oh, dude, remember that game, Mischief Makers for the N64?
[60:02.86]Wow, you should play that, dude.
[60:04.08]I loved that game when I was a kid, and I'm gonna play it for you.
[60:08.42]One day.
[60:12.22]Fuck.
[60:15.89]I didn't see that.
[60:16.41]Sheesh.
[60:18.49]Being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[60:21.27]That was right on my neck.
[60:24.33]You must scare the dog out of the courtyard.
[60:30.66]Why even balance?
[60:31.60]Just fucking go.
[60:37.48]Onimusha waiting room?
[60:40.74]Onimusha?
[60:42.68]How do I know what that is?
[60:51.93]Got it.
[60:52.59]Nice.
[60:52.79]Alright, I'm good.
[60:55.57]Almost there.
[60:55.91]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[61:03.01]I hit B on it and it didn't do anything.
[61:08.93]I didn't miss the coin.
[61:13.57]Okay, that's one thing I will never play.
[61:15.85]I promise.
[61:16.25]Okay, you know how I said that like four of you are really excited that I'm here right now playing this game?
[61:21.54]There's probably like 3,000 of you here that would be excited if I played League.
[61:26.46]I don't care.
[61:27.28]I only impress like three people, not like 5,000.
[61:29.34]I'm sorry.
[61:39.65]Got it.
[61:39.97]Alright.
[61:40.77]I scared the dog.
[61:41.93]This is such an elaborate way for me to scare this dog.
[61:45.60]I guess I'm going to keep going.
[61:49.66]Oh, God.
[61:50.30]Minigame unlocked.
[61:51.08]What minigame?
[61:54.44]Play Neverhood.
[61:56.14]Maybe one day.
[61:56.70]I kind of like this game, though.
[62:04.07]I'm not kidding.
[62:05.89]Typically, by now, I would be like, let's do something else.
[62:10.68]Let's do something else.
[62:14.12]No, not today.
[62:14.54]I kind of like this.
[62:16.50]This is kind of fun.
[62:18.00]I don't hate this.
[62:19.88]What am I doing?
[62:26.57]Find a way to scare the dog.
[62:27.81]Wait, right here.
[62:29.05]This is it.
[62:35.16]I'm not going to kill the dog, right?
[62:43.05]The dog almost just got exploded.
[62:48.83]Oh, now.
[62:49.41]Bow wow.
[62:49.91]Mission complete.
[62:54.46]Do we do Jinx at the Sphinx?
[62:56.20]Right.
[62:56.46]Yeah, that's another one.
[62:58.10]That's another one.
[62:58.64]You'll see, baby.
[63:05.88]Somebody said worst stream contender.
[63:07.82]Get out of here.
[63:08.54]I'll get this request stream and get out of here.
[63:11.78]Ban that guy for real.
[63:12.76]I'm just like having fun playing Ratatouille.
[63:19.64]Get out of here.
[63:28.38]He's still playing this?
[63:31.26]Yeah, I want to play it.
[63:34.59]It took me...
[63:37.00]Hold on.
[63:37.24]Let me detuber that a little bit.
[63:39.24]It's gonna be like three months to get this game and find it and be like, yeah, I guess I'll pay $75 for it.
[63:46.29]No, I'm playing this for like another at least 20 minutes.
[63:51.55]The dog is gone.
[63:59.38]I can go.
[63:59.74]Yeah, we got dog shortcut.
[64:01.10]Unlocked.
[64:05.68]Those four guys don't even exist.
[64:07.36]Oh, they don't?
[64:08.52]Really?
[64:10.20]Really?
[64:10.95]Okay.
[64:11.83]Let's find out.
[64:13.35]Let's see.
[64:14.29]I'm curious.
[64:14.93]Hey, excuse me.
[64:16.39]Sit down for a second.
[64:18.77]Let's do a straw poll.
[64:20.77]Straw poll?
[64:21.48]Let's see how many... Okay, it's more than four.
[64:24.54]If this gets more than four votes for, yes, I like this game, keep playing it...
[64:30.52]Then we're good.
[64:31.14]If this gets less than four votes, I will change to whatever fucking cave you want.
[64:36.25]You ready?
[64:41.25]This poll is called.
[64:42.11]Here we go.
[64:45.63]You like this?
[64:49.43]Yes?
[64:50.89]No.
[64:52.04]Here we go.
[64:53.58]If this gets more than four votes.
[64:57.94]Oh, fuck.
[64:58.24]Alright, we're good.
[65:02.27]All I'm looking for is four yeses.
[65:03.87]Oh, would you look at that?
[65:12.76]Two, three hundred, five hundred, six hundred.
[65:16.56]It's 40% of you guys.
[65:17.30]42%.
[65:17.32]It's more than four guys, isn't it?
[65:30.17]Those are bots.
[65:32.47]Shitload of people are voting on this, by the way.
[65:34.39]We never get this much participation.
[65:36.93]It's like 3,000 votes right now.
[65:39.95]Find the chili peppers.
[65:40.87]Avoid the thief.
[65:41.47]Seven boxes left.
[65:42.51]Alright, let's go.
[65:43.35]Do a new poll.
[66:01.64]That's 45%.
[66:03.26]That's more than one.
[66:05.82]Dude, those four guys aren't even here.
[66:07.28]You're right.
[66:07.74]No, they were replaced by apparently like 1,300 people.
[66:14.13]People have spoken.
[66:15.61]The majority wants me to stop.
[66:17.09]But the large minority wants me to stay.
[66:20.83]And that's what we're doing.
[66:25.28]I never said this was a democracy right now.
[66:26.94]I said this was a one-guy moment.
[66:28.38]And there's 1,500 one-guys.
[66:37.09]Gotta clear the gutters.
[66:37.92]There was gerrymandering.
[66:49.15]Okay, I got to clear the trash.
[66:56.52]You're distracting me on purpose now.
[66:59.28]You're doing this to me?
[67:00.20]What is this?
[67:01.57]Robots?
[67:03.35]You're distracting me on purpose because you know that I'm going to be like, okay, I don't understand what to do.
[67:07.31]Well, way to go.
[67:07.81]So we're going to play Saw.
[67:12.01]I don't even say that.
[67:18.69]Guys even if I put saw in I don't even know where to start.
[67:22.39]There's like an hour left of saw alright Okay, are you listening?
[67:28.01]Are you listening?
[67:29.12]Are you listening?
[67:32.86]I will finish saw tonight.
[67:34.50]Okay.
[67:35.66]Are you alright?
[67:36.10]Are you good?
[67:37.66]Are you good?
[67:46.15]Alright.
[67:49.11]No way.
[67:49.45]Yeah.
[67:50.39]I will finish Saw 1 tonight so we can prepare for Saw 2 during the Halloween October month.
[67:56.50]Get that back.
[68:02.44]24-hour stream?
[68:04.58]It's only been one hour, so no.
[68:07.77]It's not going to be even close.
[68:14.28]This game is fucking sick.
[68:15.48]Actually, it's not even that bad.
[68:17.12]You guys need to give it a real chance.
[68:26.38]What?
[68:26.68]How much was left in Saw?
[68:28.54]Like one to two hours, right?
[68:29.92]There was like less than an hour or two, wasn't there?
[68:40.63]Four hours?
[68:41.35]No way.
[68:46.91]Jerma's chat fucking sucks, dude.
[68:50.17]Where did it go?
[69:01.02]At first, it just gave it.
[69:01.92]It was just like, oh, fuck this.
[69:06.36]I'm going to go a different way.
[69:07.11]Can I not jump?
[69:14.29]I'm gonna knock him out, pick it up, and then run.
[69:15.87]Here we go.
[69:24.26]Was it diminishing returns on the stun?
[69:43.60]World of Warcraft.
[69:45.43]Oh shit.
[69:45.89]I can do a double here.
[69:46.65]Please don't tell me I just screwed this up.
[69:50.93]Did I mess it up?
[69:53.41]I believe you must clear a path to the sewer grate.
[69:57.09]I think I screwed it up.
[70:02.49]Oh shit.
[70:03.21]Does it still work?
[70:05.35]Like Ghostbusters Remastered.
[70:06.97]I hope this still works.
[70:07.73]Does it have to be like in the indicator?
[70:15.26]Oh, thank you.
[70:18.75]Oh, I got something.
[70:26.03]Are there any good Ghostbusters games?
[70:29.01]Yeah, okay.
[70:29.59]That Ghostbusters game from 2008.
[70:31.61]It was pretty good.
[70:34.11]It was.
[70:34.49]It was alright.
[70:36.11]I wouldn't necessarily say it was the greatest game I've ever played.
[70:39.58]It was pretty good.
[70:41.24]I liked it.
[70:43.66]It did a good job.
[70:51.82]Can I drag the box?
[70:52.68]I don't think I can drag anything.
[70:53.76]Really get another double.
[71:02.36]Luigi's Mansion?
[71:09.19]Ah.
[71:10.25]Ah.
[71:11.83]Ah, no Luigi's Mansion.
[71:12.83]Not right now.
[71:15.63]Okay, there's only two more boxes and we're good.
[71:24.03]How funny is it that I played Mario Sunshine on the GameCube and they just decided to HD re-release it?
[71:32.31]When I saw that I was like, come on man.
[71:35.89]It's been like fucking 15 years.
[71:37.81]Like, what are you doing that after I play it?
[71:40.41]Hey, watch the stream.
[71:41.21]Nintendo watches the streams.
[71:44.69]Shit, I gotta go the other way.
[71:48.31]It's trash, is it?
[72:01.18]Yeah, because it's been confirmed that the head of Nintendo of Antarctica watches the streams.
[72:06.54]I've gotten DMs about it.
[72:12.36]How do I get this over there?
[72:17.80]What the hell?
[72:23.00]Can I not go that way?
[72:23.76]Can I drop this down?
[72:30.03]I can't throw it.
[72:32.65]Ow, fuck.
[72:33.37]Easy.
[72:41.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[72:41.98]Leave me alone, squirrel.
[72:44.60]Ignite it and then talk.
[72:45.56]No, I got it right here.
[72:46.50]This is the last two, right?
[72:47.52]Yeah.
[72:48.92]There's one more.
[72:50.54]Shit.
[72:54.93]Bro.
[72:55.51]MonkaS.
[72:59.41]Last one's down there.
[73:00.33]I got it.
[73:08.81]I know, dude.
[73:10.47]I have one box left.
[73:11.79]Are you watching the same person?
[73:15.72]Who are you talking to?
[73:16.44]It's obviously not me.
[73:24.34]Last one.
[73:26.74]Oh, I can walk it, right?
[73:31.25]Turn off the tutorials?
[73:33.35]Oh.
[73:33.45]Alright, am I gonna die if I fall from here?
[73:37.46]How much fall damage is too much fall damage?
[73:47.38]Wait, it's exploding.
[73:49.38]Oh.
[73:50.38]That's annoying.
[73:56.28]Fucking ruined.
[73:58.92]It's fine.
[74:07.83]Yoda is stupid.
[74:11.09]Uh, Yoda's not stupid.
[74:13.61]Yoda's one of the smartest Jedi ever.
[74:15.18]Alright, you cannot let it go at all.
[74:33.07]You cannot let it go at all.
[74:34.05]It has to be very gentle.
[74:36.23]Probably shouldn't even get this one, then.
[74:46.41]You're stalling for viewers.
[74:51.36]You think that's going to help me?
[74:52.94]Stalling in Ratatouille is going to help me with viewers?
[74:57.20]It's the other way around.
[74:58.85]I can't get this one.
[74:59.45]This one doesn't work.
[75:00.03]If I drop it, what happens?
[75:02.15]Of course.
[75:02.49]Fuck.
[75:02.95]Whatever.
[75:03.25]Let's go the other way.
[75:07.53]Oh, dude, he's definitely stalling to lose viewers.
[75:11.67]That's what you mean.
[75:13.21]No, you guys aren't going anywhere.
[75:15.11]You guys aren't going anywhere.
[75:18.98]I just like saw baited all of you.
[75:21.96]Now you're going to stay to the end of the stream.
[75:23.08]You're going to watch all the ads.
[75:25.28]You're going to watch.
[75:25.76]You're going to stay the whole time.
[75:26.94]You're going to keep my engagements up because you know Saw's coming at some point.
[75:31.34]It's saw baited.
[75:34.24]It's going to happen.
[75:34.98]I'm going to play Saw.
[75:35.68]You know what I am.
[75:39.07]Not yet.
[75:43.39]This is like, okay, I'm gonna go like activate a bounty for Saw and the whole time I'm gonna be streaming naked.
[75:51.03]Trying to get like 50,000 viewers here.
[75:53.45]Okay, now let's play Saw for the bounty.
[75:59.84]Have to have as many people here as possible so the sponsors think it's cool.
[76:13.06]Like I just stream naked for an hour and Then I turn the webcam off turn on saw it's a sponsored stream.
[76:19.11]There's 50,000 people here I call this guy that's sponsoring the stream.
[76:22.03]Hey come look at the stream man.
[76:23.07]There's a lot of people here right now Holy shit, man.
[76:27.41]That was a good idea to like have to sponsor that stream.
[76:30.30]There's 50k people here, dude.
[76:32.10]Oh
[76:38.53]And then 20 minutes, like 30 minutes later, I get banned.
[76:42.55]Hey, we're just checking in.
[76:43.77]We saw that your channel has been permanently removed.
[76:47.53]Huge numbers, though, by the way.
[76:48.83]Yeah, so what's that payout look like?
[76:53.49]Um, it's like $700,000.
[76:54.31]Okay, time to retire.
[76:55.27]Goodbye.
[76:55.45]Oh, what's that?
[77:12.27]Imagine having to negotiate that like in your contract or sponsorship or like if you do to claim this I
[77:35.17]Yeah, is it okay if I stream, like, you know, naked for an hour?
[77:38.45]And then if I hit, like, 100,000 concurrent viewers because I'm, like, the naked guy on Twitch?
[77:45.23]Because that still counts, right?
[77:47.10]If I immediately switch to your game.
[77:57.06]It has to.
[77:57.47]What's that for?
[78:04.54]Is this absolutely necessary?
[78:07.06]What's that for?
[78:12.74]Oh, I want to play Mafia.
[78:14.64]That's another thing I'm doing.
[78:16.06]Oh, shit.
[78:16.56]Let's do that tomorrow.
[78:17.18]Let's play Mafia tomorrow.
[78:19.28]The Mafia remake.
[78:20.22]I'm playing that tomorrow.
[78:23.32]Oh, yeah.
[78:23.62]Yeah.
[78:23.98]I'm playing Mafia remake tomorrow.
[78:26.12]Good call.
[78:26.85]Good call.
[78:27.69]Uh, there's nothing... Nothing there.
[78:35.38]I was going to play it anyways, but good call.
[78:37.77]Alright, what are the missions?
[78:38.89]I have like two or three more, right?
[78:53.64]Yeah, I want to play Mafia.
[78:56.98]I've heard it's good.
[78:58.48]I've heard it's very, very passable.
[79:01.04]Which these days, passable means good in the video game industry now.
[79:06.82]Six and a half out of ten is now a nine.
[79:13.42]In this new world we're in.
[79:14.86]Of video games.
[79:20.48]Ooh.
[79:21.54]Olives.
[79:22.02]Oh.
[79:22.78]Spit them out.
[79:23.46]Gross.
[79:25.49]Crush them up into oil and you got my attention.
[79:27.93]Not whole though.
[79:28.57]Disgusting.
[79:30.27]Cutting board calamity?
[79:35.86]Oh shit, there's a cooking mission.
[79:41.12]Would you date Remy if you were a rat?
[79:42.90]No.
[79:43.10]Did somebody say olive eating challenge or am I making that up?
[79:53.39]Smash 30 veggies before the time runs out.
[79:58.16]Oh shit, this is cool.
[80:02.86]I'm just a trash compactor.
[80:11.12]You should stream Dark Souls with... What is this spam?
[80:16.82]You should stream Dark Souls while naked and you start the camera resolution at like one by one pixel and every time you die the resolution doubles.
[80:22.14]I think it's a great idea.
[80:22.90]It's like a sword art online but instead of dying in real life you slowly get exposed to tens of thousands of people all over the world.
[80:32.72]That's quite the challenge.
[80:40.56]imagine you would be trying as hard as you could that would be a silent stream wait wait this is important to think about one by one pixel that doubles in resolution quality or that increases in how much percentage every time I die how long would it take before your penile area is visible how long
[81:08.00]1 times 1... How many pixels would it be for you to determine, like, the actual area?
[81:15.65]2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8... It would take, like, 5 deaths before I got banned from the fucking site.
[81:22.47]20 deaths?
[81:24.73]32 by 32.
[81:29.39]But it would have to be like wicked blurry too.
[81:30.95]And like every time you died after it got to like 32 by 32.
[81:33.38]How many times did I die in Dark Souls?
[81:36.90]Is what I'm asking.
[81:38.60]I think I died like 112 times.
[81:41.58]So not only would it be visible, but it would be in 4K by the time that I got to there.
[81:46.54]So that's not going to work.
[82:02.51]What a great idea.
[82:04.43]Jerma, your penis takes up one pixel.
[82:17.05]It's so, like, fucking rude.
[82:18.75]And, like, weird and gross and unnecessary.
[82:21.67]One pixel.
[82:34.46]Okay, let's keep going.
[82:47.59]Pixel dick.
[82:51.08]That's fucking funny.
[82:51.94]That's funny, alright?
[82:53.18]Whatever.
[82:54.60]You clicked on the mature audience thing when you got here.
[82:56.78]You're fine.
[82:58.73]We're all a mature audience here.
[83:02.91]You clicked it.
[83:05.48]Ooh, another one.
[83:17.60]One by one.
[83:18.50]A one pixel webcam that increases in quality.
[83:21.84]But you're naked.
[83:23.42]So you better not die more than 50 times in whatever game you're playing.
[83:30.32]That's such an unbelievable... That's like such a fucked up... Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[83:41.05]Where am I?
[83:43.97]I hate this.
[83:45.83]I hate this so much you have no idea.
[83:48.09]Where am I?
[83:50.15]Wait, what?
[83:54.16]All I heard was...
[84:04.85]Get it!
[84:10.85]Oh, this one sucks.
[84:11.83]I don't want to do this one again.
[84:13.13]Come on.
[84:26.26]This shit.
[84:26.92]Alright, do it again.
[84:29.49]Get it next time.
[84:33.39]Are you gonna play Hades?
[84:34.33]They put a huge Easter egg about you in the game.
[84:36.67]What?
[84:36.83]What are you talking about?
[84:40.35]It did?
[84:43.83]Alright, I gotta beat this.
[85:00.60]Where the fuck am I?
[85:03.43]That's jebaited?
[85:04.05]Why the hell would they... What is it?
[85:17.26]Is that just a monster jebait?
[85:18.92]Is that what you're telling me?
[85:24.16]Come on, I need two more of these damn things.
[85:27.21]Come on!
[85:31.15]Oh yeah!
[85:33.05]Come on, one more.
[85:33.97]What?
[85:37.95]Well, at least I'm a good cook.
[85:44.92]Oh, you sloppy piece of shit.
[86:08.30]There's 8,000 people here watching you play Ratatouille.
[86:12.62]I mean, yeah, I guess there is.
[86:14.09]That speaks to the quality of the video game.
[86:17.69]Right?
[86:18.15]People, you're interested.
[86:20.17]I'm interested.
[86:20.73]Now it's not time for Saw.
[86:23.47]Alright, I'm doing it.
[86:24.45]Let's go.
[86:27.39]1, 2, 3, silence.
[86:28.25]Silence.
[86:33.44]You have bots.
[86:36.42]If you, okay, if you think that I've been doing this shit for 10 years, and at year number 10 is the year that I decide to turn on bots.
[86:45.09]I don't know, man.
[86:45.75]I don't know what to tell you.
[87:00.92]Come on Alright left side Three more
[87:33.76]Hey, let's never do that again.
[87:35.92]I collected cream.
[87:58.70]Nice job, Twitch username here.
[88:02.77]Alright, what was I doing over here?
[88:04.03]Oh, I cleared the gutters.
[88:05.77]Now what?
[88:08.27]Ooh, I didn't get to the next mission.
[88:14.77]Springboard race.
[88:15.71]Get to the end.
[88:16.45]Sure, that's right.
[88:20.45]Oh.
[88:23.98]This is awesome.
[88:25.64]Okay, I gotta do good.
[88:33.56]Is it?
[88:35.12]Okay.
[88:36.66]What?
[88:37.08]Wait, is that implying that I'm going to show my hand in 15 minutes?
[88:43.56]I'm not going to do that.
[89:07.07]I need a... Where's the... I need a... Where's the other missions?
[89:14.13]I need more missions.
[89:18.05]I'm going to go back to the rat cave.
[89:20.13]Wait, no.
[89:20.49]Over here.
[89:20.77]Have I gone over this way?
[89:25.15]Shit.
[89:25.41]I can't go that way.
[89:26.01]Where should I go?
[89:27.57]No, I'm not doing a wart reveal.
[89:31.27]That's disgusting.
[89:32.25]And I don't want you to see that.
[89:33.38]It makes me sick.
[89:36.48]Thanks for signing up for this trial run of Twitch bot services.
[89:38.76]We hope you are enjoying your personalized ego boost.
[89:43.28]I'm gonna read the rest of that just because I feel like it.
[89:46.16]You have 30 days until your trail is over.
[89:48.73]If you are enjoying your service, sign up for our one-year activation plan.
[90:00.47]It actually said trail.
[90:01.61]I didn't say trial wrong.
[90:03.21]It was trail.
[90:08.31]Activate.
[90:12.15]Imagine if I, like, alt-tabbed.
[90:14.37]And you guys saw that I had a viewbot running.
[90:16.79]And it was, like, ten viewbots.
[90:20.71]Like, apparently I'm so... I need those extra ten people.
[90:24.51]Alright, what am I gonna do?
[90:25.59]Tell me.
[90:25.92]I wanna know the missions, dude.
[90:36.17]That was a repeated joke.
[90:37.11]Same joke.
[90:37.59]No, it's not.
[90:37.97]That's not true.
[90:38.91]That's not the same joke as last week.
[90:40.33]The joke last week was if I just revealed that I have view bots.
[90:43.58]Not that there were 10.
[90:44.86]I added to the joke from last week.
[90:53.90]That's not the same joke.
[90:55.93]It's not a repeat.
[90:56.59]No, it's not.
[90:58.49]No, it isn't.
[91:01.12]That was a different piece of humor attached to the same idea.
[91:13.06]And look at the rules, guys.
[91:14.17]Disagreeing with the streamer is a bannable offense.
[91:17.93]Don't do it.
[91:18.33]Alright, I can go up there.
[91:21.25]There's one here.
[91:21.87]Okay, there's one up there.
[91:23.01]I'm going to go up there.
[91:32.76]There's a menu up there.
[91:33.46]I can get it.
[91:38.68]Okay, yes.
[91:39.28]Good stream.
[91:40.34]Thank you.
[91:42.36]You think so?
[91:42.91]Nice.
[91:43.29]Good.
[91:44.01]Because if you didn't... You know what?
[91:47.57]Put my finger up and across.
[91:49.19]You know what I mean?
[91:51.01]You're out.
[91:53.25]Oh, right there.
[91:53.65]Okay, I see.
[91:58.73]A rat's gotta do what a rat's gotta do.
[92:01.98]That way.
[92:06.58]He's a murderer.
[92:08.88]No, I'm not.
[92:09.96]You're missing what I'm saying.
[92:12.38]And I'm dead.
[92:14.64]I just did an Olympic dive.
[92:16.58]Okay, I did just say.
[92:26.78]Worst link?
[92:28.00]I'm not clicking on any links right now.
[92:30.05]I'm busy.
[92:39.01]What's the fastest way?
[92:39.85]Okay, I see.
[92:40.57]We're going this way.
[92:44.83]Link sucks.
[92:45.36]Don't worry.
[92:45.88]I'm not gonna... Soulless Marvel video... Soulless Marvel 2020 video game waiting room.
[92:53.10]Soulless.
[92:58.96]Wait, is that the one where it's the porn actor versions of all the people?
[93:19.21]Get up there.
[93:21.09]Yes.
[93:21.51]What?
[93:21.71]What do you mean what?
[93:25.61]That thing was clearly turned off.
[93:27.11]Alright.
[93:33.99]Do not.
[93:34.31]We're going to go this way.
[93:45.19]Wait, coins.
[93:47.25]Shit, I'm actually, I like, I'm starting to actually unironically enjoy this game.
[93:51.13]You know what I mean?
[93:55.37]I'm unironically enjoying Ratatouille.
[93:57.51]Is that bad?
[93:58.13]That's kind of not a bad thing though, is it?
[94:00.31]I don't think so.
[94:06.32]I got a minigame.
[94:11.92]Seems like a solid 7 out of 10.
[94:13.00]It's a pretty solid 7 out of 10.
[94:18.56]This is where I want to be up here.
[94:21.88]Right there.
[94:22.24]Minigame.
[94:24.26]Daring Dash Stage 1.
[94:31.38]Was I lying earlier?
[94:32.40]I lie every day.
[94:35.97]Sometimes I lie about a lie I already told.
[94:38.85]So there's a double lie going on.
[94:40.15]And I don't know which one I actually tried to put off as real.
[94:43.13]What do you mean?
[94:45.07]This one again?
[94:49.23]Didn't I already do this one?
[94:59.45]I walked too far and went over the edge.
[95:01.85]That's how well I was doing.
[95:08.72]This one's way harder than the other one.
[95:14.12]Under... Underneath both of those, by the way.
[95:15.84]Good.
[95:31.24]Alright, this is fine.
[95:39.69]Yes, what'd I get?
[95:40.79]Chocolat.
[95:41.63]Great!
[95:48.05]Did your dog ever do that to your ear?
[95:59.40]Otto will be up in the bed sometimes, and I'll just kind of roll over, and I'll feel inside of my ear just... And I'm like... Have you explored all of the dream worlds?
[96:15.46]Oh, have I?
[96:22.88]Nice.
[96:23.22]Okay, there's another one.
[96:24.62]The ant army has invaded the courtyard.
[96:26.34]Clear the courtyard of ten ants before time runs out.
[96:33.22]Look at the courtyard of the 10 view bots.
[96:38.64]They got already lost.
[96:50.53]Shit.
[96:51.81]They have the same spider movement pattern in Binding of Isaac and that's why I hate those enemies.
[97:13.57]I could beat the hush with my eyes closed.
[97:16.77]But I will get hit in the first room five times by the same spider.
[97:19.62]Because of this.
[97:22.20]How many more?
[97:29.74]Three more?
[97:33.20]Reminds me of Madagascar.
[97:34.44]I mean, they're both just licensed video games.
[97:45.50]Look, that person just came in and what did they say?
[97:48.74]You guys told me I was wrong.
[97:50.79]You said I was like, you're out of your mind.
[97:52.61]They're all the same game.
[97:55.69]That person just came in and said, oh, well, this looks just like Madagascar.
[97:58.53]Remember, we talked about that.
[98:10.12]Rooftop rolling.
[98:11.18]Yes, let's do it.
[98:13.54]30G, nice.
[98:16.42]That I'm unlocking these for David and not me.
[98:20.24]Remember when you cared about this shit?
[98:21.46]Remember when you really, truly gave a shit about achievements?
[98:24.90]And you do the most asinine shit in the game to make sure you got like 100 points.
[98:28.58]I remember I played Viking for the Xbox 360.
[98:40.89]And I remember wanting, there was like an achievement to kill like 500 enemies.
[98:44.67]And I was like, I'm going to do that.
[98:45.51]I want to do that.
[98:46.91]This game sucks.
[98:47.53]I don't even care.
[98:49.27]I need to kill these 500 enemies to get the achievement because I want it.
[98:54.13]Find a way.
[98:54.71]Get the coin from the bird's nest.
[98:57.26]Bring the coin to the rain gutter and drop it down.
[99:01.30]Actually, Viking was kind of good.
[99:06.60]Wasn't Viking a good game?
[99:07.54]It was kind of fun.
[99:10.90]Oh, well.
[99:11.60]Viking was like God of War for the PS4.
[99:16.04]But kind of way worse, but still good.
[99:19.18]People are throwing books out the window at me.
[99:21.16]Okay.
[99:21.94]Honey poo waiting room.
[99:22.51]Sure.
[99:37.40]Hey, make sure you watch every single stream start to finish.
[99:39.81]Might happen.
[99:41.85]And watch every ad.
[99:44.31]What happened?
[99:44.67]You, new viewer here.
[99:45.57]Well, we looked at the poo stream.
[99:46.71]What could happen?
[99:48.21]Might happen.
[99:48.82]Just stay here.
[99:49.84]Don't leave.
[99:50.18]There was a 0.0001% chance that there was a poo stream, okay?
[100:01.78]There's also a 0.001% chance that you're going to get that, like, burning team captain, but you still opened 5,000 boxes.
[100:07.23]No, didn't you?
[100:08.37]Me too.
[100:08.75]Stay here.
[100:09.53]Oh.
[100:10.43]I got double force ghost.
[100:15.59]Where is it?
[100:32.09]It's on the rooftop.
[100:38.69]I apologize.
[100:40.93]I'm sorry for saying those two letters back to back.
[100:47.86]Food is good.
[100:49.58]Food is most definitely good.
[100:53.86]Oh, up.
[100:54.98]Get on the ball and go up the sludge.
[101:08.87]What is that link in chat right now?
[101:10.31]I have no idea.
[101:12.19]I'm not going to click it for at least a little while.
[101:17.55]Remus, your father said a coin is in the nest on the rooftop.
[101:21.93]I hope you're not afraid of heights.
[101:24.41]Me?
[101:25.31]Afraid of heights?
[101:26.13]Aren't I on the roof?
[101:27.01]Of course not.
[101:31.03]Can I climb this?
[101:33.37]I have to run into this with the ball.
[101:36.33]Shit.
[101:41.70]Alright, we're fine.
[101:43.80]Do you want to unlock the bonus pack?
[101:49.58]Click it.
[101:50.02]Okay.
[101:50.34]Fine.
[101:50.60]Let's see what you guys got here.
[102:07.73]Not bad.
[102:08.83]But, I mean, is it, is it really, is it that good?
[102:26.67]Oh shit, it's a one by one dick pixel.
[102:35.48]Wrong.
[102:37.67]Okay, well, what's the right one?
[102:38.81]Glover.
[102:43.53]If Jerma clicks this, he has to play Glover.
[102:46.67]You guys know that this is one of the first games I ever had for this N64?
[102:53.62]If Jerma clicks this, he has to play Glover.
[102:57.24]I did.
[102:57.60]I clicked it.
[102:58.04]Okay.
[103:11.24]Is the reason why you say Glover because you're watching me do the ball here?
[103:16.19]Don't you turn into different hands in this game?
[103:18.13]There's like five different hands.
[103:19.49]One of them's like a strong hand.
[103:20.67]One's like a quick hand.
[103:23.43]I remember this game.
[103:24.03]Are we going to play Glover now?
[103:32.92]Not right now.
[103:36.41]The N64 is one of the only consoles I have not really done on this stream.
[103:39.97]And there's a reason for that.
[103:42.36]Gotta save the best for last.
[103:47.88]We've done 3DO, SEGA CD, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox.
[103:54.86]No, we've not done any N64.
[103:55.86]Now why is that?
[104:12.95]Conker's bad fur day.
[104:14.65]No, that's illegal.
[104:15.31]You can't play the illegal one.
[104:17.97]I hope you're not afraid of heights.
[104:21.71]I think I've got this height thing under control, no problem.
[104:24.56]I hope you're not afraid of heights.
[104:27.02]Remy, your father is afraid of heights.
[104:30.56]The air vents lead to the nest.
[104:33.66]Sounds easy.
[104:34.13]I can smell the creation of the class.
[104:45.47]Yeah, isn't like, Conker's Bad, isn't like a sex scene in it or something?
[104:48.01]There's something in that that's not okay.
[104:50.07]There's like a sex scene in it or something.
[105:00.55]It's not.
[105:07.13]Ooh, this level's pretty good.
[105:08.17]This is a good level.
[105:09.59]This is not a game that's worth skipping, I'm sorry.
[105:17.83]Wait, should I check over here?
[105:22.43]Oops.
[105:22.91]Okay, we're good.
[105:24.54]I need the ball, probably.
[105:32.68]I think there's a respawnable ball here.
[105:41.81]Conker.
[105:54.91]stop get the wow so you guys don't know where the original conquer unbelievable people like minus twoing that because you think I'm just doing that like oh he made like a conqueror voice you've never played diddy kong racing then unbelievable that's unbelievable to me and that it makes me upset
[106:14.80]Unbelievable.
[106:16.30]You want me to play Conker's Bad Thursday, but you don't know what the origin of Conker is, and you don't know what that voice was.
[106:24.41]Really.
[106:25.63]You want me to play Conker's Bad Thursday, but that's it.
[106:28.21]You don't know anything else.
[106:30.69]Oh, I win this one.
[106:32.54]Oh, there it is.
[106:40.99]As you might imagine, you will deposit objects here.
[106:44.44]Simple, no?
[106:48.20]Minus four.
[106:48.86]Keep it up, buddy.
[106:51.52]Monkey, yes.
[106:54.33]Bring the coin to the rain gutter.
[107:01.87]Minus four.
[107:02.48]You don't even know how the minus system even works.
[107:19.14]I think there's like a problem with the minus system.
[107:20.72]Can we do the plus twos just to see if it works?
[107:23.42]I'm testing it out just to like see.
[107:26.08]-2.
[107:27.32]They did minus four and it like fucked up the algorithm a little bit.
[107:29.56]So we have to do +2 to even it out a little.
[107:37.90]If you can see my face right now, I just had the grossest face.
[107:41.11]Bonus pack.
[107:41.77]What's that even mean?
[107:47.75]I'm getting trolled.
[107:48.43]Stop trolling me.
[107:49.01]Now I'm getting trolled.
[107:49.63]Stop trolling me.
[107:56.29]Into the gutter.
[108:02.11]Done.
[108:03.63]Sick.
[108:04.65]I beat it.
[108:05.03]Yes.
[108:17.44]Good job.
[108:17.80]Rooftop rolling mission complete.
[108:20.44]Construction complete.
[108:22.02]Building.
[108:29.40]I think I only have one more mission to do.
[108:36.33]Jump it.
[108:39.63]I'm intrigued.
[108:43.73]Oh, this is for right now.
[108:44.79]I see.
[108:55.42]This is the joke stock for today.
[108:56.60]Alright, so it's been an hour and 50 seconds.
[109:00.66]Alright, I know that it's being gamed.
[109:02.16]I know you guys are fucking around.
[109:04.52]What happened, um... Okay, something was really, really funny.
[109:08.72]At like 20 minutes.
[109:11.61]And then at 21 or 22 minutes, something happened.
[109:15.71]Nobody was happy at 21 minutes.
[109:17.63]What happened?
[109:24.61]What did I do?
[109:27.09]It was a joke in the game.
[109:28.61]Stop doing that.
[109:31.93]You're crashing.
[109:33.00]Being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[109:35.16]Yeah, we were on a complete uptick here.
[109:37.64]And now everyone's manipulating the market.
[109:39.36]I still want to do the market thing.
[109:40.98]A lot more involved than I thought it was going to be.
[109:47.03]Let's see.
[109:47.83]Dark, smelly, wet.
[109:49.51]The perfect place for a colony of rats.
[109:57.79]Alright dad, now what?
[109:58.89]Now what?
[109:59.17]This is the first major encounter of the game.
[110:07.74]Well, I'm sorry.
[110:23.07]If you just did that, you just got manipulated, dude.
[110:26.94]You just got absolutely destroyed.
[110:30.82]You bought those calls?
[110:32.76]Let's say it was like $500 worth of calls.
[110:35.72]The second that you hit the accept button, they were worth $40.
[110:38.16]Damn.
[110:39.52]Damn.
[110:44.19]That's not good.
[110:46.51]Selene needs the handle to work the gramophone.
[110:49.33]Find the handle and bring it to her.
[110:52.58]Go to Emil.
[110:53.46]Lodge the coin from the gutter.
[110:55.20]Turn the faucet on.
[110:56.56]Clear the gutter.
[110:57.20]Alright, more of this bullshit.
[110:58.62]This is timed.
[110:59.20]This is fucking timed.
[111:00.38]I'm swearing, by the way.
[111:01.10]Shit.
[111:01.30]This is gonna be bad.
[111:02.98]I'm gonna mess this up like three times.
[111:25.91]I love this game.
[111:26.49]It lets me cook.
[111:27.27]Alright, got it.
[111:32.69]Now where does this go?
[111:33.77]Bring the handle to Selene, who is standing near the gramophone.
[111:35.87]Alright, get out of the way.
[111:37.11]Where's the gramophone?
[111:41.05]Oh, shit. ...
[111:55.73]Good.
[111:56.35]Turn it on.
[112:00.06]You can't just do -2.
[112:01.92]That poor guy is going to owe money.
[112:03.44]You're going to margin call the guy that bought 20 calls.
[112:06.20]Don't do that.
[112:14.93]Remember, you must find a way to the water faucet.
[112:18.11]Allay!
[112:19.99]What?
[112:20.57]You need to flood the gutter.
[112:21.75]Tie a rope to the faucet so it can be turned on.
[112:31.70]Hey, rope.
[112:37.41]Turn off the music.
[112:41.07]Why?
[112:41.49]What do you mean, turn off the music?
[112:44.49]Alright, that's done.
[112:48.55]Task complete.
[112:52.43]Last one is over here somewhere.
[112:54.15]What is it?
[112:54.45]Is it up?
[113:01.46]I'm going to dislodge the thing.
[113:03.64]This music sucks.
[113:15.14]It's whatever.
[113:15.64]You'll be fine.
[113:18.94]You don't like French bistro music?
[113:21.00]Why not?
[113:27.77]Where is this thing that I have to get?
[113:40.32]Where is it?
[113:46.52]I don't see anything.
[113:49.88]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[113:51.34]Oh, well.
[113:56.48]Great!
[113:59.62]Shit.
[114:05.63]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Selene can get it to work.
[114:10.59]Stop it.
[114:11.15]Selene.
[114:16.72]Turn on the gramophone.
[114:27.89]Stop saying -2.
[114:28.79]You guys are ruining everything.
[114:35.69]They're ruining everything.
[114:37.73]They're ruining everything.
[114:38.76]Ow, that hurts my head.
[114:47.58]It's over.
[114:47.90]What?
[114:48.10]Let me see.
[115:04.42]It's got so bad.
[115:09.45]If Jerma clicks, he has to spend Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[115:12.89]No.
[115:14.51]I will not do that.
[115:15.21]I'm sorry.
[115:15.57]That's never going to happen.
[115:19.94]Guys, I played Five Nights at Freddy's 3 on the iPad for no reason.
[115:23.22]Maybe it was 4.
[115:25.42]I installed it.
[115:26.00]I downloaded it.
[115:26.58]I bought it.
[115:27.06]And I played it for maybe 5 minutes.
[115:28.94]And then I deleted the app off the iPhone.
[115:31.22]Or the iPad.
[115:32.32]I didn't want to play it ever again.
[115:33.18]I was just like, this is stupid.
[115:34.02]Why did I buy this?
[115:34.56]Sheesh.
[115:50.42]Did I hit my jaw on the edge?
[115:53.66]Why?
[115:56.78]Did I just stone cold stun myself on the edge of the concrete?
[116:14.12]We're crashing.
[116:15.06]We're crashing the market.
[116:17.46]We're gonna crash the market.
[116:21.42]What you guys don't know is I sold at the top already.
[116:25.71]I don't care.
[116:26.97]Crash away.
[116:28.59]I can't.
[116:29.25]I made $14.
[116:36.40]We all know the Jerm of stock is only worth like a tenth of a penny.
[116:39.56]You guys can't just... Sheesh.
[116:43.92]Being a great chef sure isn't easy.
[116:46.12]Take that!
[116:52.83]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[117:02.68]Jerma Crash, yeah.
[117:04.20]Jerma, hey.
[117:05.62]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[117:06.82]Welcome to Jerma Crash.
[117:08.90]The series where I crash.
[117:10.30]Stop dying on these.
[117:12.80]The series where I lose all my money at the stock market.
[117:16.08]You blew my, you ruined my whole joke.
[117:17.94]The whole, the stupid ping pong thing.
[117:22.90]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[117:31.09]I have to pay attention to the video game.
[117:32.58]For the love of God, pay attention.
[117:35.50]Where did it go?
[117:37.22]It's alright.
[117:38.12]I got the Ren and Stimpy sound effect that came back into life.
[117:40.68]What?
[117:40.88]It's been a fall to almost two minutes.
[117:59.49]He's delirious.
[118:00.63]No, I just, I had a good Jerma crap joke and it got ruined.
[118:04.37]That was a good one.
[118:05.09]It would have been, but I got interrupted in the middle of it.
[118:08.75]Turn the music off.
[118:12.93]Shh, not too loud.
[118:14.73]What camera?
[118:16.25]Oh, why is there, why is it extra loud?
[118:20.90]What?
[118:24.12]There.
[118:28.91]Remember, you must find a way to the water faucet.
[118:38.58]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[118:40.46]Let me see if I can get it correct.
[118:41.38]I'll try it a few times.
[118:43.72]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[118:59.72]That's pretty good.
[119:02.28]I need to have a shittier mic, though.
[119:04.45]That'd make sense.
[119:05.69]Alright, so how do I get that coin?
[119:08.31]Okay, I gotta... Mary Poppins into the thing.
[119:10.81]Alright.
[119:18.08]Actually robot playing.
[119:19.38]Am I dead if I go in here with the ball?
[119:22.90]Nope.
[119:23.08]Am I dead if that showers off my head?
[119:26.72]Probably.
[119:43.91]Perhaps if you find ze handle to ze gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[119:50.73]Perhaps if you find ze handle to ze gramophone.
[120:00.13]I can do accents.
[120:01.99]Yeah.
[120:02.93]I can do, you know, French.
[120:05.99]Oh, you can?
[120:06.63]Yeah.
[120:07.89]Can you give me a little bit of a sample?
[120:09.83]Sure.
[120:11.21]I have to go to ze store today to get some of ze Tylenol.
[120:14.81]Ooh, very, very good.
[120:17.75]Very good.
[120:31.74]Remember, you must find a way to the water faucet.
[120:34.89]Allez!
[120:35.51]Mods, do something.
[120:36.73]What?
[120:39.51]What happened?
[120:40.37]Isn't everything okay?
[120:41.71]What's going on?
[120:52.08]Somebody added to his portfolio.
[120:59.52]Oh, be careful in the stock market.
[121:01.46]Seriously, if you like- we make like jokes about like, STOCKS and- be careful.
[121:04.89]Because what happens is when you- if you buy like a stock, let's say you have like an app or something, you have like a- you use like Schwab or whatever the fuck you use.
[121:13.83]You think you're a genius.
[121:16.13]You buy like five shares of fucking Toyota or whatever and it goes up like 4% and you make like 8 bucks, you're like, I'm the smartest man alive!
[121:24.72]I can't fucking lose!
[121:28.17]Then you make one bad call and you lose 500 bucks.
[121:33.31]Just be fucking careful.
[121:34.59]Don't do it.
[121:36.58]Be careful.
[121:37.18]Alright, how do I get this?
[121:44.46]It's lodged up in the sludge.
[121:46.17]I can't get it.
[121:47.83]Come back later.
[121:56.76]That music does... That music is hell.
[122:00.88]People are gonna... People are gonna want fake meat.
[122:04.62]Stop reminding me of my past fucking mistakes.
[122:07.81]I was so certain.
[122:10.03]So certain.
[122:11.81]I was not more certain than anything else in my entire life.
[122:15.03]Beyond Meat was worth like fucking like 40 billion dollars.
[122:18.17]And I'm like, there's no way.
[122:18.89]There's no fucking way that that's gonna stay.
[122:21.65]Like Beyond Meat was worth more than...
[122:25.05]Like every American manufacturing car company.
[122:29.71]It's more expensive than all the airlines combined.
[122:32.98]There's no way it's going to stay at like $300 a share.
[122:37.78]It did.

[125:28.29]Why can I go up all the way here?
[125:40.13]Okay, I saw somebody using an emote.
[125:42.57]It was a laughing face and a finger pointing.
[125:45.87]And it was like a cracking up face and a finger pointing and they wrote so bad, so bad, so bad.
[125:50.60]I don't know why it was making me laugh.
[125:53.26]I can't turn it off.
[125:54.12]I had better wash up before I cook.
[126:01.84]There.
[126:11.69]Tried.
[126:13.47]It's even worse.
[126:20.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[126:20.81]It was like a human finger.
[126:24.99]It was like a human finger pointing right at the screen.
[126:36.45]Finish the level.
[126:37.17]Dude, what are you... I'm trying.
[126:38.57]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[126:39.57]This game's one of the hardest games ever.
[126:41.21]This is one of those games that has a bunch of bugs and glitches and it's got tons of difficult platforming.
[126:47.49]It's one of the hardest games on the 360.
[126:48.61]It's one of the hardest things.
[126:56.53]Is it a Lemmy emote?
[126:57.61]Oh yeah, yeah.
[126:58.95]It's just like a pointing and laughing.
[127:00.69]It's just so like rude.
[127:03.66]So bad.
[127:04.54]Like pointing and laughing.
[127:12.38]Alright, guys.
[127:12.84]I need to be like 11 to figure this out, apparently.
[127:17.95]How do I get up?
[127:31.29]Just go up.
[127:31.91]That's what I'm trying to do.
[127:33.13]So bad.
[127:39.05]So bad.
[127:39.73]Omega.
[127:44.55]Holy shit, dude.

[127:46.68]Okay.
[127:49.46]This way?
[127:49.86]I need to wash up before I handle the food.
[127:57.24]I gotta go over there, but I don't think I can make it from here.
[128:05.96]I'm dead again.
[128:06.34]I'm dead.
[128:06.62]I'm dead.
[128:06.92]I'm dead.
[128:07.48]I'm dead.
[128:07.82]I'm a good cook.
[128:08.58]I gotta go pee.
[128:11.68]Great!
[128:22.49]Clockwork.
[128:23.45]No, not yet.
[128:24.01]Hold on.
[128:26.53]Do this one first.
[128:32.29]Mark Echoes.
[128:33.47]I played that already.
[128:35.39]You think you're pulling out some really, really obscure video game?
[128:38.07]I've done.
[128:38.39]I played that already on stream.
[128:40.77]I played the Mark Echo game already.
[128:43.09]Somebody link that person to where it is.
[128:46.99]Can I climb that?
[128:52.83]Perhaps a chili pepper bomb would help, huh, Remy?
[128:55.75]Perhaps a chili pepper bomb.
[128:57.60]I can climb this.
[128:59.24]Alright, let's go.
[129:12.75]I'm right back.
[132:19.18]Okay.
[132:20.08]I needed a drink, too.
[132:24.81]Take a little sip.
[132:36.33]I don't know why I'm laughing.
[132:37.23]There's no reason to be laughing.
[132:39.94]I don't know.
[132:40.24]I just... Somewhere in my head, I thought something was funny somewhere, and I just started laughing at it.
[132:46.20]I don't know why.
[132:48.48]There.
[132:50.56]Well, at least I'm a good cook.
[132:54.53]Great!
[132:57.93]I am just one of the weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[133:05.23]I know that already.
[133:05.96]I'm aware of it completely.
[133:06.78]Can you climb this, please, Remy?
[133:10.84]You fucking idiot.
[133:16.20]You guys think I say, like, fuck wealth?
[133:19.64]Are you fucking idiot?
[133:20.72]Yeah, I think I do.
[133:27.20]Almost got air shot.
[133:33.75]Oh, yup.
[133:34.47]Don't.
[133:35.39]Now what?
[133:39.37]There's so many roads that lead to nowhere.
[133:41.30]I thought I died.
[133:46.16]I'm okay.
[133:48.95]Break through the window?
[133:49.83]Are you serious?
[133:52.84]Are you kidding me?
[134:01.24]Was I really supposed to go through the window?
[134:04.02]Oh, fuck.
[134:04.76]I'll try it.
[134:05.14]I miss the music, don't you?
[134:15.93]I really miss the... Hold on.
[134:21.63]Okay.
[134:23.13]I miss the music.
[134:23.77]Don't shoot it.
[134:35.78]Through the window.
[134:36.30]That was wrong.
[134:44.06]Nice try, though.
[134:45.38]I appreciate it.
[134:52.18]Where do I go?
[134:53.14]There's one that's dislodged up there, but then... I have no idea how to... Force ghost.
[135:11.19]I've done that.
[135:11.65]I don't even know what the guy's name is.
[135:12.69]I have no idea what this guy's name is.
[135:19.11]The force ghost chef.
[135:22.32]His name is Ellas?
[135:24.06]Ellas.
[135:26.32]Oh, fucking... Wait, I gotta do it in an order.
[135:29.94]There's an order.
[135:34.45]You do the turn the phone on.
[135:37.92]Okay, you turn the faucet on.
[135:39.52]There's like three rats.
[135:40.82]Just die.
[135:41.68]Restart it.
[135:42.46]There's four rats.
[135:43.32]You turn on the phone.
[135:45.02]The phone lets you turn the faucet on.
[135:46.12]The faucet then lets you dislodge the coin somehow with one of your friends.
[135:49.77]I got it.
[135:50.27]Here we go.
[135:50.69]One, two, three.
[135:52.11]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[135:57.45]Perhaps.
[136:05.96]Reed Chatmore, sad boy.
[136:07.98]Why am I sad?
[136:10.82]Sad?
[136:11.28]I don't think I'm sad right now.
[136:15.54]I think I'm fairly happy right now.
[136:18.15]I'm very happy.
[136:20.81]Who said I was sad?
[136:21.55]I want that person timed out.
[136:23.07]I want that person timed out for a long fucking time.
[136:31.17]An hour.
[136:31.99]Oh, fuck.

[137:16.66]Something.
[137:20.10]All the water.
[137:30.71]Oh, shit.
[137:31.21]Okay.
[137:31.47]I got to blow this up.
[137:32.23]I got to blow this up.
[137:39.49]Okay, I needed a bomb.
[137:47.89]Ow, it hurts.
[137:48.49]I know.
[137:48.75]I'm sorry.
[137:52.10]Where's the cherry bomb?
[137:53.38]Wasn't it up here somewhere?
[137:54.44]I need a big view.
[137:56.92]Cherry bomb.
[137:57.44]Do you guys see anyone?
[138:00.91]I don't see a cherry bomb anywhere.
[138:07.64]Out here or no?
[138:08.96]Is it the very top?
[138:16.41]Is it?
[138:16.61]Is this absolutely necessary?
[138:20.77]Right there.
[138:23.29]Oh, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.
[138:25.43]Can somebody edit that for me?
[138:27.53]I know this is going to be a race for you guys to do this, but can somebody just take out all the times he says zip in like a 30-second video and just let me watch it on stream?
[138:40.29]No.
[138:42.41]Don't get fucking comboed.
[138:46.41]But where is this bomb?
[138:51.86]How do they can't get up there?
[138:54.64]I swear to God, if you kill me, I'm going to be so mad.
[139:03.25]There isn't one?
[139:03.97]There has to be.
[139:04.63]That's how you get that.
[139:15.96]I hate this fucking game so much.
[139:17.30]It's triggering my fight or flight response.
[139:21.34]Alright.
[139:22.66]Fast forward to ten seconds from now when there's a whole three monitor.
[139:25.24]I'm sorry.
[139:26.52]Where is this bomb?
[139:27.62]I need to blow that thing up down there.
[139:43.29]Don't make me quit this game.
[139:44.35]I like this game.
[139:45.83]I was having fun.
[139:49.26]Please get a guide.
[139:50.32]Open the dumpster.
[139:53.20]Dumpster?
[139:53.84]Alright, where's the dumpster?
[139:55.02]In this mission...
[140:05.20]Alright.
[140:05.76]Let me actually process what I just said.
[140:07.36]Next to the wall, near a cat, you will see a pallet over the gutter and a box.
[140:10.05]Climb on top of this and up to the blue highlighted pipe.
[140:41.00]You got it.
[140:41.80]I know what that is.
[140:48.34]You should watch the movie.
[140:49.18]It's good.
[140:49.72]peepoHappy.
[140:52.02]No, I probably won't.
[140:54.42]I'm serious.
[140:55.22]I probably just won't.
[140:55.98]When am I going to... It's so much like TV and movies and shit that I want to watch that I just don't have time for.
[141:01.45]How am I going to fit Ratatouille?
[141:04.39]How am I going to fit Ratatouille in there?
[141:05.61]I don't think I'm going to.
[141:09.11]Where's the box?
[141:12.98]There's the box in the gutter.
[141:13.86]There's the pipe!
[141:25.27]Other side.
[141:25.81]I see a cat.
[141:37.25]There's a box next to the cat.
[141:49.08]Okay.
[141:49.74]Box next to cat.
[141:52.62]Oh, shit.
[141:53.34]I found it.
[141:53.73]Okay, good.
[141:54.45]Didn't I do this before and I fell down?
[141:56.25]Oh.
[141:56.43]Oh.
[142:18.37]Oh, people are not going to like that one.
[142:20.23]I made it up here.
[142:22.91]Alright.
[142:46.93]Remember, Remy, you can use the rat ball to get over dangerous areas.
[142:54.68]Fake fan?
[142:56.06]No, I was doing that just to make you upset.
[142:59.56]Coin stuck in the gutter.
[143:00.40]Get the ball to Emily so he can dislodge it.
[143:05.54]Let's go.
[143:16.21]Where is he?
[143:20.47]Shit, I need to go up there.
[143:31.06]Why are you killing rats in the game?
[143:35.30]I'm not killing anybody.
[143:36.14]Ban that guy for an hour.
[143:39.26]Accusing me of killing something?
[143:40.60]What, you trying to get me in fucking trouble or something?
[143:44.18]Ban that person for an hour.
[143:49.11]I'm gonna die right there.
[143:53.84]Yes, I know, and I just tried to do it.
[143:57.62]What are you doing, video game?
[144:03.38]Oh, I hate when that happens.
[144:16.41]Okay, we got the coin.
[144:18.79]Final task.
[144:23.71]Is get coin.
[144:25.37]What can I tell you?
[144:26.19]I love good food.
[144:27.47]Okay.
[144:29.82]Oh my god, don't do it, please.
[144:31.38]I know you want to do like a TF2 scout thing where you jump off a really high thing and then double jump right at the very fucking bottom.
[144:40.04]It didn't work!
[144:43.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[144:59.32]perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone celine can get it to work I really I swear to god why would I want to do this again why would I want to do this again why I just was trying to skip time I had like one minute left I don't want to oh my god that hurt my head when I did that by the way not just yours
[145:24.23]Literally, why?
[145:24.83]I don't know.
[145:25.73]I thought it was really gonna work.
[145:27.13]I really did.
[145:27.73]I thought I could do, like, a scout TF2 thing where you jump off a... In Dust Bowl, where you jump off the fucking roof where the second turn is and you fall jump right before you hit the ground.
[145:37.34]Do the double jump.
[145:39.74]This is not the same game, though.
[145:41.28]Oh my god, I'm so annoyed.
[145:43.20]What have I done?
[145:43.76]Why did I do this?
[145:49.90]So unnecessary, but, like, I just fucking had to.
[145:52.44]Sorry, I know what to do.
[145:57.48]I thought I could double jump like boom right before the ground I really did it I tried it's gonna be fast don't worry I promise I just Spider-Man'd off the empire state building
[146:26.02]Holy shit.
[146:26.99]Okay, come on.
[146:31.71]Torture stream.
[146:38.55]Why do I always end up at the worst stream?
[146:40.62]What?
[146:40.84]Hey!
[146:41.12]Pay that person for an hour.
[146:48.94]God damn it.
[146:50.68]What if I... Okay.
[146:51.19]Okay.
[146:54.05]I don't know what you're talking about.
[146:55.41]I'm having fun.
[146:55.97]Ow, my chest.
[147:05.90]Ow, my chest.
[147:12.74]Sheesh.
[147:13.10]Ow.
[147:13.48]I need to settle down.
[147:14.08]That actually hurt.
[147:25.13]Why did I Empire State Building off?
[147:36.56]Why did I do that?
[147:37.04]That was so unnecessary.
[147:38.12]I wasn't even trying to be funny or anything.
[147:39.41]I really wasn't.
[147:41.95]Like, I wasn't trying to make a... Oh, that's alright.
[147:44.25]I'll get it.
[147:44.79]Right now.
[147:45.59]Don't... Just... It's okay.
[147:47.47]Don't let them... Don't let them see you upset.
[147:53.58]X, it's been two hours in this game.
[147:55.94]I actually have been having fun, though.
[147:59.94]Contrary to maybe popular belief, I've been having actually a pretty good time today.
[148:02.88]This has been fun.
[148:07.88]Words don't hurt.
[148:09.44]And you wear Gucci?
[148:10.18]If you said something like that, I have no idea what you were saying.
[148:18.00]I'm going to play Saw.
[148:18.98]I am going to play Saw.
[148:19.80]I need to beat this, though.
[148:25.48]Saw is coming up, I promise.
[148:26.92]This is my first stream, and this is great.
[148:35.55]Hey.
[148:37.71]Welcome to the stream.
[148:38.43]Thanks for joining.
[148:39.11]Thanks for hanging out.
[148:40.13]I typically stream Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
[148:46.52]4 to 5 p.m.
[148:47.76]Eastern.
[148:49.14]Maybe 3 p.m.
[148:49.74]Eastern sometimes.
[148:52.36]No one said that yesterday, did they?
[148:58.74]Oh, look at the logs.
[149:04.96]Yes, they did.
[149:05.38]Look at the logs.
[149:05.80]The paid actor.
[149:06.30]Seriously, this is really finicky.
[149:07.78]It just is.
[149:08.32]Good.
[149:38.17]CBD streamer.
[149:50.74]Sing the song, the new follower song.
[149:52.82]There is, I don't know.
[149:57.00]There is none.
[149:57.70]I don't remember what it even was.
[150:10.98]Hey, you're new.
[150:11.88]Welcome to the stream.
[150:14.00]It's such a dream or something like that, right?
[150:16.15]It's so fucking tiring.
[150:26.17]Okay, this time do not Empire State Building off the top.
[150:35.78]Some streamers do that.
[150:37.84]Yes, and when you do that five to six thousand times.
[150:41.90]I feel like that would get a little bit on your nerves.
[150:45.51]Do it.
[150:53.19]No, I'm not going to do it.
[150:53.99]I'm not going to jump off and do the double jump.
[150:56.33]Don't say that.
[150:56.97]Stop it.
[150:58.57]I'm going to go down normally.
[151:01.53]No, I'm not going to do it.
[151:02.39]I'm not doing it.
[151:03.21]I'm not going to do it.
[151:03.83]No, no, I'm not going to do it.
[151:05.07]I'm not going to do it.
[151:05.59]I'm not going to do it.
[151:06.11]I'm not going to do it.
[151:06.69]I'm not going to do it.
[151:08.17]I'm not going to do it.
[151:09.09]I'm not going to do it.
[151:09.65]It's been too long.
[151:10.89]I'm going to go.
[151:11.29]How do I get down normally though?
[151:14.26]Or this way?
[151:15.60]How do you actually get down from here normally?
[151:24.70]Is an umbrella where?
[151:29.57]Did I miss an umbrella up here?
[151:39.43]I don't see an umbrella up here.
[151:50.58]Was there?
[151:52.36]There is.
[151:52.76]He's blind.
[151:54.84]I'm so nervous.
[151:55.60]I actually don't want to fall off.
[151:59.10]Because if I fall off again, I have to turn.
[152:00.63]Oh, shit.
[152:01.11]There's an umbrella right there.
[152:01.99]You're right.
[152:02.25]Like, if I fall off again, I have to pivot the saw.
[152:05.63]I do.
[152:07.27]Another death here is inexcusable.
[152:13.22]Okay.
[152:13.90]Okay.
[152:14.40]Okay.
[152:14.80]This game is fucking with me now.
[152:29.45]Don't let go.
[152:30.17]Don't let go of A. Don't let go of A. Don't let go of A. Don't let go of A. It's sweaty, I know, but don't let go.
[152:41.17]I thought I died.
[152:42.03]I thought it was dead.
[152:42.87]I don't know why.
[152:43.35]I'm so used to hitting the ground and seeing a black screen.
[152:54.90]Alright, where's that coin?
[153:02.38]Where's the coin?
[153:06.08]Where's the coin?
[153:17.23]There's the coin!
[153:28.85]Bring coin... to...
[153:32.52]What do I do?
[153:40.27]I don't understand.
[153:58.65]What?
[153:59.41]How do I get up there?
[154:00.59]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[154:09.62]I have to go back up there and go all the way across.
[154:13.90]Up there?
[154:15.16]And get over there somehow.
[154:17.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[154:20.27]No, I refuse to.
[154:21.27]I'm not going to lose it.
[154:26.28]Full stream, buddy.
[154:26.88]Thanks.
[154:57.45]Shut up.
[155:02.61]Stop being chat, for God's sake.
[155:11.19]Okay.
[155:12.64]Why am I sliding?
[155:14.92]Stop sliding.
[155:15.76]Stop the slide.
[155:26.06]Good.
[155:26.56]I win.
[155:35.07]Hooray.
[155:35.91]Finally.
[155:37.23]Find a high spot.
[155:38.29]Okay.
[155:38.69]Are we still timed?
[155:39.71]It's still timed.
[155:41.65]Oh, fuck.
[155:42.11]I forgot about the slipperiness.
[155:46.00]Okay.
[155:47.62]Now I gotta go over here.
[156:05.40]It's just an anime character that got told anything slightly surprising.
[156:47.10]have a new viewer they're joining the stream they're gonna have a big super dream every day we get some new fans to our club perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone salim can get it to work
[157:20.67]Sunk cost fallacy.
[157:21.93]Sunk cost fallacy.
[157:22.99]Put another $500 into Beyond Meat.
[157:25.57]Put another $1,000 onto Beyond Meat.
[157:27.87]Sunk cost fallacy.
[157:28.59]Let's go.
[157:41.64]Saw.
[157:42.30]I'm going to play Saw.
[157:43.56]I will in just a minute.
[157:47.37]I'll probably stop in a minute.
[157:48.31]Just give me one minute.
[157:55.04]Get him away from the PC.
[157:56.60]He's good.
[157:57.56]Okay, fine.
[157:58.78]I'm away from the PC now.
[157:59.90]I got a wireless controller, motherfucker.
[158:02.56]I've got a wireless controller.
[158:06.86]You can't take it away from me.
[158:08.42]I could be in the other room.
[158:19.48]I could be anywhere.
[158:20.20]I could be on an airplane and still be playing right now.
[158:23.27]With the wireless technology that's in every Xbox.
[158:27.37]Isn't that the whole concept of the PS Vita?
[158:35.06]Couldn't you turn on your PlayStation 4 from your Vita and play a game on your Vita or something?
[158:46.87]Oh, I gotta go to the cat thing.
[158:53.10]That's a scary concept, by the way.
[158:54.50]Because if you do that, what if your Vita runs out of battery and you're on vacation?
[159:00.31]It's calling me.
[159:05.07]If your Vita runs out of battery and you're not going to be home for three weeks, does that shit just stay on?
[159:11.80]Does your PS4 just stay powered on?
[159:22.48]Did I say smite time?
[159:23.52]Why would I play smite right now?
[159:26.70]I need to complete this.
[159:27.88]I have to.
[159:28.28]I will have nightmares about me not being able to beat level 1's mode thing.
[159:36.81]GTA 4.
[159:37.89]No.
[159:46.16]Look at how much faster I'm doing this right now.
[159:47.96]Look.
[159:48.80]We're almost done.
[159:50.06]We're almost there.
[159:53.54]I can't believe I fucking fell.
[159:59.10]I can't believe I died.
[160:00.11]Okay, are the rat traps instant death?
[160:03.07]Or did I just have one cube left?
[160:05.41]I don't even know.
[160:10.65]They are instant death.
[160:11.83]Oh my god.
[160:20.25]Okay, Grover.
[160:21.04]I know.
[160:21.50]I know I can.
[160:22.36]Super Grover.
[160:22.98]Leave me the fuck alone.
[160:50.78]Should have used those Dave states.
[160:53.38]Provide it.
[160:55.64]Okay, coin is done.
[161:00.50]Now he's gonna go to the other side.
[161:01.60]I'm done.
[161:02.34]I've got it.
[161:03.92]I'm gonna go for the skip and I'm gonna... Fuck it, whatever.
[161:05.58]I'm going for the skip.
[161:06.22]I'm gonna go for the skip right now.
[161:08.04]I'm going for the skip right now.
[161:08.81]I'm gonna get it.
[161:09.21]I'm gonna go for the... Oh, don't get it.
[161:10.21]There's an umbrella up there.
[161:16.13]Shit.
[161:18.75]Just get the umbrella and float over there.
[161:22.01]Why would I do that?
[161:23.01]Oh, no!
[161:30.24]Wow!
[161:30.86]You can actually do that.
[161:31.84]Okay, I'm okay.
[161:32.72]I'm alright.
[161:35.72]Okay, now I have to get back up there.
[161:37.35]Stop it.
[161:39.13]I have to get back up to that.
[161:50.98]I'm gonna play saw.
[161:54.08]I'm gonna play saw.
[161:55.60]I'm sorry guys.
[161:56.44]I'm sorry.
[161:57.00]I betrayed your trust.
[161:58.56]I'm sorry I betrayed your trust.
[162:00.04]I'm gonna play saw now I'm sorry I betrayed your trust.
[162:08.77]Okay.
[162:09.01]I think the wireless controller is lagging I'm not even kidding
[162:20.43]It's- No, it is, it is, it is.
[162:21.65]Alright, it is, it is.
[162:22.45]I just pressed B. I'm fucking outta here.
[162:24.43]Turn, turn it off.
[162:25.35]Turn it off, turn it off.
[162:26.30]Oh, I have to beat it though.
[162:27.48]I wanna beat it so bad.
[162:28.50]I wanna beat it so bad.
[162:34.42]Oh, come on, man.
[162:36.76]Jump.
[162:37.54]Yup.
[162:38.18]Yup.
[162:39.33]Yup.
[162:39.95]I'm naked, but I'm gonna turn it on.
[162:41.79]I'm naked, but I'm gonna turn the webcam on.
[162:43.65]This is fucked up.
[162:45.09]Look.
[162:45.67]Look, I need everybody to see this.
[162:46.61]I'll just duck.
[162:47.63]I'll duck.
[162:47.95]I don't even care.
[162:56.53]Look, ready?
[162:56.87]Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[162:59.72]I need to wash up before I handle the food.
[163:05.66]I told you, the fucking controller's broken.
[163:19.21]It's not jumping!
[163:20.41]Look!
[163:22.89]What?! !
[163:27.72]Oh, wait a minute.
[163:43.53]Never a dull moment around here, huh?
[163:52.32]Stomach reveal?
[163:53.54]No, what are you talking about?
[163:55.40]I was ducking.
[164:10.14]In the reflection of what?
[164:20.87]Okay, that was me.
[164:22.71]That was me knowing that there was going to be a frame.
[164:26.65]So I blocked it with my hand.
[164:34.01]I knew there was going to be one frame because I had fucked up before.
[164:39.70]Shit, my foot.
[164:41.18]Alright.
[164:41.96]Give me a minute.
[164:43.90]I'll be one more break and I'm gonna move the saw.
[168:17.05]A really important question.
[168:18.15]Do we gain viewers?
[168:22.12]I gained like 300 viewers when I said I was gonna play Saw.
[168:26.82]What?
[168:29.04]I have an important question.
[168:29.84]This is really important.
[168:33.70]Do I even have like a save file?
[168:40.98]It's because you got naked.
[168:47.88]What are you trying to show me here?
[168:59.38]I can't even look at this image because... Hold on.
[169:01.90]Let me change.
[169:02.40]Let me see.
[169:12.15]He's freaking out now.
[169:14.59]He's laughing.
[169:19.11]Okay, that's my hand.
[169:24.74]Okay, guys, I'm going to break this image down.
[169:27.48]We're going to break this image down.
[169:29.40]That's my arm.
[169:36.03]This is my arm.
[169:42.55]New emote.
[169:44.21]That's my arm.
[169:45.69]By the way, if what you think... Wait, what am I wearing?
[169:48.41]A diaper?
[169:49.93]Am I wearing a bee's nest?
[169:51.88]Is my bee's nest... What are you talking about?
[169:54.24]That's like... I don't even know what that is.
[169:58.62]That's like my hair.
[170:00.56]That's like the top of my head.
[170:02.04]That's... Diaper.
[170:13.12]You think I would turn the camera on if I had this like bees nest ball sack on stream?
[170:18.07]Alright, let's go.
[170:18.73]He's sitting in his diaper.
[170:30.98]Okay, let me put saw in.
[170:32.90]Can I try?
[170:33.56]Can I?
[170:34.12]Hear me out.
[170:34.58]Can I play Ratatouille one more time, please?
[170:37.26]Can I just play Ratatouille one more time?
[170:39.49]Let me play Ratatouille one more time.
[170:40.93]Let me try to beat that part one more time, okay?
[170:43.83]And we're going to play saw.
[170:44.69]Alright?
[170:45.21]Yeah.
[170:45.89]Let me just do that level of Ratatouille one more time, okay?
[170:48.67]Okay, let's do the Ratatouille level one more time.
[170:54.45]I thought about it while I got a little bit of water.
[170:56.71]Let's try one more.
[170:57.43]I want to do it one more time.
[171:01.36]Then I'll never play it again.
[171:05.93]Does anyone remember if the Saw save file is on David?
[171:09.81]Or if it's on my account?
[171:10.97]I don't remember.
[171:11.43]It's on mine?
[171:20.15]It's on Tend and D Ragoon?
[171:21.93]Okay.
[171:23.56]What I can do is... Wait, is the webcam on?
[171:27.40]No.
[171:28.32]Is it?
[171:29.18]I'm fucking ducking.
[171:29.86]I don't know.
[171:32.52]No, it's not.
[171:32.88]Okay, good.
[171:33.22]Alright, we're going to do this one more time.
[171:40.63]Alright, last try.
[171:41.55]That's it.
[171:43.43]Look, I'm already going.
[171:44.11]I'm already there.
[171:45.33]I'm already like... Alright, here we go.
[171:47.65]Let's go.
[171:49.36]Final try, I promise.
[171:54.80]V's nest.
[171:55.02]V's nest.
[171:58.28]Dirty, like rotten pair of underwear is what that's in that image.
[172:02.00]Yeah, it's my hair.
[172:03.36]It's the light shining off the top of my head.
[172:05.94]Myth busted.
[172:06.80]Sorry, guys.
[172:07.86]I get to keep my Twitch account.
[172:10.16]For now.
[172:12.98]What can I tell you?
[172:13.82]Oh, wait.
[172:14.38]Should I have to play?
[172:14.90]Alright, let's go.
[172:20.26]I forget how to play.
[172:20.96]Alright, let's go.
[172:21.74]Let's go this way.
[172:22.24]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[172:28.97]And by the way, what's with this, like, Dark Souls 2 bullshit?
[172:31.85]The health bar.
[172:33.32]Have I died this many times that I can only go to half health?
[172:36.80]Do I need to take a humanity?
[172:38.30]Why do I only have four bars here?
[172:39.46]This is bullshit.
[172:40.28]I don't... Why?
[172:52.22]Perhaps if you find the handle to the gramophone, Salim can get it to work.
[172:58.01]I honestly thought it was your pubes.
[173:00.67]You do understand, I'd be gone.
[173:15.84]And I wouldn't be coming back.
[173:18.48]That would be the end.
[173:22.46]Everybody here, I'll be gone.
[173:28.02]That would be my final image.
[173:32.10]Would be my bee's nest ball sack.
[173:35.23]That would be it.
[173:37.18]And I would make a tweet.
[173:38.80]I'd be like, guys, yeah.
[173:41.33]It's been fun.
[173:42.11]No, these last like 10 years have been really, really interesting.
[173:44.41]And really, I've been a big fan of it and everything.
[173:46.13]It's been a lot of cool fun.
[173:48.55]Take care of yourselves.
[173:49.63]And yeah, do good in school and shit.
[173:52.69]And get good grades.
[173:53.69]And take care of yourselves.
[173:54.51]And eat well.
[173:55.88]And by the way, here's a link to my Patreon.
[174:04.46]Don't forget about me.
[174:08.95]Okay, now I'm going to do the cat thing.
[174:11.69]Is this absolutely necessary?
[174:15.02]There's a cat thing over here.
[174:21.72]Just pivot to OnlyFans.
[174:22.64]I believe we must clear a path to the sewer grate.
[174:33.66]No, dude.
[174:34.20]Oh my god!
[174:38.54]What are you doing?
[174:39.80]Stop moving.
[174:41.36]I'm sliding, I'm slipping.
[175:00.05]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[175:04.15]I believe you must clear a path to the sewer grate.
[175:08.32]I believe.
[175:14.30]What the fuck is happening?
[175:16.80]I'll get it next time.
[175:20.93]I can't beat a kid's game.
[175:21.71]I can't beat a kid's game.
[175:22.33]I can't beat a kid's game.
[175:23.33]I can't beat a kid's game.
[175:24.33]It's over.
[175:25.25]The disk is out.
