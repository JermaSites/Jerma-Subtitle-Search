[13:19.79]We're not gonna run out of fucking money this time.
[13:21.21]We have a hundred million dollars.
[13:22.45]That ain't gonna happen this time.
[13:26.66]Why are we all dressed the same?
[13:27.90]We need to have, like, a little makeover session.
[13:29.30]Alright, where's the advanced script office?
[13:34.61]See, we're in the year 2000.
[13:35.17]That means we have access to everything.

[16:27.46]Usually this doesn't happen, but thanks guys.
[16:32.10]Alright, make your script.
[16:33.88]The name of the movie is going to be not a comedy.
[16:39.23]We start with an action movie.
[16:43.93]It's going to be Renegade Realtor.
[16:48.33]And Gabe the Glue Man DeGrossi.
[16:49.75]No, no.
[16:50.25]Gabe DeGrossi is going to be the private eye.
[16:52.37]Like the detective.
[16:55.95]We need a better... I don't want to be in this movie.
[16:59.29]Dr. Roker is going to be in this movie instead.
[17:02.65]As Jack Rage.
[17:09.27]Gabe DeGrossi will be Private J. Killeen.
[17:13.04]And Barry, who doesn't have a last name...
[17:15.91]will be Harry Wyzycki.
[17:18.97]So who's the realtor?
[17:23.13]This is the realtor.
[17:24.47]He's going to be the... Dr. Roker will be the realtor.
[17:29.24]No, they don't need a stuntman.
[17:31.56]Freeform.
[17:33.40]Let's see what we can give them for clothes.
[17:41.72]Alright, what do we got?
[17:43.01]A cloud costume?
[17:44.39]No, he needs to be in like a private investigator outfit.
[17:47.77]Should he just be in a Ninja Turtles costume?
[17:53.97]Well, it's not a Ninja Turtles costume, but, you know.
[17:58.78]Alright, here we go.
[17:59.30]He'll be like an English Bobby.
[18:03.38]Okay, that works.
[18:05.28]Dr. Roker's a realtor.
[18:06.90]This is Renegade Realtor.
[18:09.63]Can't be in this 90s urban Santa Claus Bum costume, that'll be Barry.
[18:16.99]Yeah, this kind of looks like a renegade realtor He needs glasses though, otherwise, he's not Dr. Roker without glasses No, maybe this one
[18:38.72]bum costume?
[18:39.96]No, we're gonna have a bum, don't worry.
[18:42.08]It's gonna be Barry.
[18:48.57]Okay, where's the bum costume?
[18:53.21]Wait until we find something we like.
[18:58.60]What about dark werewolf costume?
[19:00.34]That's something we haven't seen before.
[19:08.32]I just want to see if there's any monsters.
[19:09.92]Let me see the monsters.
[19:11.92]Monster.
[19:13.72]Oh, wow.
[19:14.14]Look at all these new monsters.
[19:17.10]No, he'll be a ghost.
[19:18.08]He'll be a medieval ghost.
[19:21.32]Oh, my fucking God.
[19:22.32]What is that?
[19:23.06]Skeletons and shit?
[19:24.04]Look at all these things I have to play with now.
[19:26.88]What happened to Alien?
[19:32.25]It's just like a toxic Avenger in this movie.
[19:35.69]Is he getting bugged?
[19:39.08]21st century alien.
[19:42.08]Angel.
[19:44.28]There's so much now.
[19:45.66]There's so much.
[19:50.69]Okay, he kind of has to be a bunny rabbit at this point, right?
[19:55.71]Alright, fine.
[19:56.41]He's a bunny.
[19:57.89]There's a gold mine here.
[20:02.17]Okay, renegade realtor.
[20:05.63]We have a ton of extras already, so...
[20:10.67]I don't even know what this is in here for, but we always have to have a fucking weird freak creature, right?
[20:16.37]So Renegade Realtor has to start in, let's see, Urban City Street.
[20:21.86]No, Urban Office.
[20:23.96]Either Urban Office or... Miniature City?
[20:30.98]Yeah, we gotta get like a good shot of the Miniature City.
[20:33.87]On fire.
[20:43.92]Hey, yeah, the movie opens with the whole city on fire.
[20:47.50]That makes sense.
[20:51.36]Okay.
[20:56.05]What else can we do in the city?
[20:57.43]City explosions.
[20:59.27]What?
[20:59.53]Is this aliens are attacking?
[21:04.25]Are we gonna make ADF the movie?
[21:16.76]No, no, no, no.
[21:17.67]We can't go that far off the rails yet.
[21:19.27]It needs to be city on fire.
[21:20.39]Because this is like a post-apocalyptic world, you know?
[21:29.75]Head impact.
[21:36.05]Alright.
[21:39.80]Why would that be here?
[21:45.37]Yeah, it's to show you, like, the chaos in the city.
[21:48.95]It's gotta be somebody else.
[21:49.79]It's gotta be just, like, me.
[21:53.12]What's with my hair?
[21:54.34]Why do I have long hair?
[21:57.46]I did not give myself long hair like that.
[22:03.98]No, that's getting canned.
[22:05.34]That's getting shit canned.
[22:10.70]Okay, now we go to...
[22:15.24]Let's just see.

[22:46.59]Shoot.
[22:48.21]Okay.
[22:48.83]I think the movie just changed.
[22:51.05]I'm pretty sure the movie just changed.
[22:53.90]Yeah, it did.
[22:55.32]For sure.
[22:59.66]This is now a monster movie.
[23:08.03]A giant English Bobby.
[23:10.51]Yeah, a giant English Bobby.
[23:13.79]No, it's gotta be the renegade.
[23:16.17]Right?
[23:16.41]Or should it be the bunny?
[23:17.25]No.
[23:17.85]Fuck, who cares?
[23:18.65]Just him.
[23:22.85]Well, he's the renegade, right?
[23:25.55]Wouldn't it have to be him?
[23:33.10]Okay.
[23:36.24]I'm gonna do miniature city again.
[23:42.02]Car skid, car turn.
[23:46.94]This gotta be like monster crushes things, right?
[23:51.44]Monster confrontation?
[23:52.85]Two monsters?
[23:53.65]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[24:14.80]We're already a little bit fucking weird.
[24:17.55]Okay.
[24:32.91]Now we need like a... This really should be two monsters at this point.
[24:41.11]It should not be these two.
[24:44.14]Monster discovered.
[24:45.24]Monster KO.
[24:46.46]Oh, God.
[24:56.10]What?
[25:06.53]Let's see.
[25:11.27]Gage Realtor.
[25:12.47]Alright, now we need to have an explosion right here because he just fell.
[25:16.37]Alright, now we need City.
[25:22.57]Miniature City.
[25:27.83]And the mothership comes in.
[25:31.31]Wait, what?
[25:36.56]This needs to be Dr. Unker.
[25:44.00]Why is he falling down?
[25:44.90]There's not even any shooting sounds.
[25:51.60]Hold on.
[25:52.06]Keep this for a second.
[25:56.50]Miniature city.

[26:20.66]This is stupid.
[26:26.18]Alright, miniature city again.
[26:35.05]City fly through?
[26:38.87]That would be kind of cool to have it fly through.
[26:40.23]Mothership departs.
[26:44.74]Monster walk.
[26:46.41]Now we have to have another storyline going on of them trying to flee the city.

[27:14.18]So now, okay, we need some scenes on the ground.
[27:17.64]That's very important.
[27:20.78]So we need... Okay.

[27:45.50]You know what I mean?
[27:46.02]Sometimes there's chaos in the city.
[28:02.07]Sometimes there's a little bit of chaos when you're trying to escape a giant monster.
[28:05.39]I'm going to change the prop.
[28:11.72]I'm going to change the backdrop.
[28:16.10]This is going to be a cool car.

[42:32.30]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[42:33.95]That doesn't make any sense.

[42:39.95]Get rid of the gun.
[42:43.41]Okay, I need props.

[43:58.72]Like, what is this grudge going on in the city that we don't know if...
[44:09.76]Just another lizard?

[44:12.08]I don't know what it should be.
[44:14.40]No, it can't.

[45:01.02]The one that just bought the soda.
[45:04.96]Gorilla versus lizard.
[45:07.44]Ah, that actually makes sense.
[45:09.31]That actually makes more sense.
[45:12.46]The gorilla's driving the car.
[45:14.03]It's always a gorilla driving the car.
[45:15.55]What am I, crazy?

[49:08.00]Scrolling landscape.
[49:11.18]Nature city.
[49:11.84]Alright, I think that's all we can do here.
[49:16.84]We're gonna have to go...
[49:21.07]Alright, we need to go inside though.
[49:22.71]That's important.
[49:27.31]Monster discovered.
[49:32.76]Monster feet again.
[49:33.58]It was just the gorilla reading a book.
[49:42.50]Okay, we need to go inside.
[49:43.65]We need to go like in a bathroom.
[49:49.23]No, in the diner.
[49:49.95]In, like, the city diner.
[49:59.12]Someone's just having a... Someone throws a drink.
[50:11.33]No, that's fucking dumb.
[50:16.75]Goes into bathroom movie 2.
[50:20.31]No, somebody's got to get thrown through the fucking window or something.
[50:25.95]Fight.
[50:28.97]Dead body, give money.
[50:32.27]Jilt.
[50:34.39]Oh, here we go.
[50:38.61]No.
[50:40.83]Actually, I kind of like that.
[50:43.72]I kind of like that.
[50:53.92]uh oh my goodness oh yeah I like that a lot uh we need that's so stupid that's the worst scene in this whole movie for sure
[51:26.55]Turn with weapon, tantrum, kill zombie, surrender, shot injured, cigarette death.
[51:42.22]Someone slaps a drunk.
[51:54.68]Okay, so what you guys don't realize is what we're doing here is this.
[52:03.93]We're doing a green screen and we're putting this in.
[52:07.89]Absolutely.
[52:12.78]Because they're just big.
[52:15.06]You're led to believe that they're just very large.
[52:18.70]Green screen.
[52:19.10]Green screen.
[52:29.22]How do I pull them in?
[52:35.66]Can I just pull them in like that?
[52:38.69]Maybe not.
[52:43.37]I just need a stage.
[52:44.87]Yeah, that's what it is.
[52:45.53]Alright, stage slap.
[52:59.68]Okay.
[53:10.51]Alright, that works.
[53:14.07]When do the soldiers come in?
[53:15.21]I'm not sure.
[53:15.71]Alright, I need to, let's take a second here to get this shit squared away.
[53:23.48]This needs to be like here.
[53:27.95]And then this.
[53:28.93]There's so many shit.
[53:30.20]There's so many fucking things on the ground.
[53:31.56]That.
[53:42.81]Here.
[53:57.72]Okay, I think it's sort of in the right spot at this moment.
[54:06.29]I think so.
[54:11.08]End with the KO.
[54:14.84]Hold on.
[54:40.38]Wait, hold on, like they were just... Who's the dead guy?
[54:44.76]Why does a guy come in and die?
[55:07.85]Why does a guy just come in and die?
[55:10.65]I don't know Do not ask me about who the fuck these people are It's like a zombie?
[55:33.09]No, they're all ghosts They're all ghosts because they destroyed the whole city
[55:39.55]So all these people are ghosts and they're like celebrating the destruction of the city.
[55:51.08]That makes sense.
[55:58.98]No, that has to be an actual dead person.
[56:06.62]Make all them gorillas?
[56:07.54]No, there's too many gorillas in this movie already.
[56:17.01]What a plot.
[56:24.96]Yeah, this has to be... This is the bunny.
[56:28.84]The bunny didn't make it, apparently.
[56:33.38]The dead ghost.
[56:40.23]No, a skeleton.
[56:42.77]No.
[56:54.04]Alright, this needs to be in a ghost costume.
[57:00.25]Just like an angel, whatever.
[57:01.35]Wait, what?
[57:06.29]No, wait, what the fuck?
[57:07.67]Oh, right.
[57:13.63]No gorillas?
[57:14.29]Yeah, no gorillas.
[57:21.07]What the hell is going on here?
[57:30.86]Hello?
[57:31.36]There we go.
[57:34.79]No gorillas.
[57:35.85]No, there's like 10 gorillas in this movie.
[57:39.16]And don't worry, you didn't think that it was gonna not end with the gorilla reading a book.
[57:43.53]Well, it's not.
[57:44.75]Sorry to, uh... Sorry to make you wait.
[57:54.35]I confused the game.
[57:55.45]Yeah, I think I did a little too many.
[57:58.00]Uh, no, this is just a guy here.
[57:59.06]This is just a fucking guy here.
[58:00.40]They didn't kill this guy.
[58:07.31]He's just talking to a ghost.
[58:08.27]He's kissing a ghost, by the way.
[58:10.15]I'm not sure you guys see this or not, but he's... And why are they small?
[58:19.67]Why are they small?
[58:25.16]Oh, boy.
[58:28.02]Alright.
[58:30.28]First movie of the night, I believe, is done.
[58:42.15]End it with the ape reading the book.
[58:50.14]Let's see here.
[58:50.78]Is there anything else I can do?
[59:12.81]I'm sorry.
[59:13.95]I'm sorry.
[59:19.19]No, we can make the camera better than this.
[59:25.62]We can make the camera better than this.
[59:46.16]Okay, start position.
[59:48.60]And I believe we can go here, right?
[59:56.21]Does that work?
[60:03.05]No.
[60:03.17]I'm just gonna have to go back and delete this one.
[60:13.88]I think I got it.
[60:14.58]I think it worked.
[60:21.75]IG had not enough gorillas.
[60:32.50]Hold on, wait.
[60:37.08]I like this one better.
[60:41.27]Somebody placed a gas tank next to it when they didn't even see it.
[60:46.35]Yep.
[60:47.75]Somebody got their revenge on the monsters.
[60:56.20]And that's a wrap.
[61:01.28]That's a wrap.
[61:06.85]Alright.
[61:09.15]You get Dr. Ochre's pizza ads?
[61:10.81]Do you seriously?
[61:13.65]Now we need somebody walking away.
[61:18.59]No, no.
[61:19.19]I want it to be a mystery.
[61:20.83]It's over.
[61:23.07]It's a mystery.
[61:26.16]We are done.
[61:30.28]Alright, let's get it into casting.
[61:32.56]Oh shit, I gotta remember this.
[61:33.60]Okay, no, that's good.
[61:39.64]Begin casting.
[61:42.39]And here we go.
[61:43.19]You're doing your own stunts, you fucking little assholes.
[61:47.11]Alright, there's eight extras.
[61:51.51]It's gotta end with the book.
[61:52.57]No, no, not for the first movie.
[61:53.95]Not our first movie.
[61:56.33]And we need miniature city.
[62:01.01]Uh, hospital?
[62:02.25]Whatever, I'm just gonna make this shit.
[62:04.29]It's free anyways, who cares.
[62:05.45]I'm actually looking forward to this one.
[62:16.70]I feel like this one's gonna be fun.
[62:19.24]Alright, set.
[62:20.84]We need miniature city.

[62:33.88]I need urban commercial street.
[62:37.18]Alright.
[62:50.88]And I need a director.
[62:53.78]I don't have a director.
[62:56.06]Well, one of these random shitheads is gonna be the director.
[63:00.10]Alright, who wants to be a director?
[63:02.33]How about you?
[63:03.47]Aaron Asshole.
[63:04.85]You are now a director.
[63:05.85]Wait, why not?
[63:12.30]Come on.

[63:38.51]Movie crew.
[63:39.14]Alright, well, you're changing to director, buddy.
[63:41.94]Why can I not make this guy director?
[63:48.28]Hire him as a director first.
[63:49.84]Isn't that what I do?
[63:50.64]Just drag him in there?
[63:55.46]Oh, right.
[63:55.94]Okay.

[65:39.92]This is a three star script, by the way.
[65:48.05]It's shooting the whole movie right now while I sit here.
[65:55.75]So we're going to have to take a second.
[65:59.33]Oh boy.
[66:00.35]It's really chugging right now to film these scenes.
[66:06.88]Anyways, I guess I'll take this opportunity to... I actually can't even move.
[66:09.48]I'm lagging.
[66:13.89]Every time it hangs up like this, it's finishing another scene.
[66:18.66]I guess I have to just sit here.
[66:21.82]Whoa!
[66:22.32]Okay, it's ready.
[66:23.86]Ready for release.
[66:24.50]We're not releasing it.

[66:50.76]It's an old game and it's filming the scenes as we play them.
[66:58.00]Alright.
[66:58.74]Okay, obviously this is a movie.
[67:00.76]It has to be made.
[67:04.03]No, that music sucks.
[67:05.49]Get rid of that immediately.
[67:06.57]Goodbye.
[67:09.27]Trash this shit.
[67:11.75]Alright, the track has to start with something terrifying, something horrifying.
[67:20.24]Alien Planet might be alright.
[67:21.74]Let's see.
[67:30.23]Kind of.
[67:41.34]Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[67:50.28]Dark Horizon.
[67:55.47]Yeah.
[68:00.07]I like Dark Horizon.
[68:08.67]Then it goes into acid bass.
[68:30.01]You can't even hear it, it's so loud.
[68:35.75]This shit is so fucking loud.
[68:37.23]Alright, drop that volume a little bit.
[68:47.68]No, the acid bass is gonna come in a little bit sooner.
[68:54.51]Yeah.
[68:56.07]Because you think, oh, here we go, we're gonna dark horizon.
[69:01.77]Here we go.
[69:03.81]Alright, that works.
[69:08.88]What is this?
[69:13.76]Get away from me!
[69:14.72]Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
[69:16.50]I'll take everybody on!
[69:17.88]I'll kill you all!
[69:19.24]That's it, you're on!
[69:20.50]Oh, that's from like the last stream.
[69:31.56]We're going to have a bunch of noises because the world is being destroyed.
[69:41.20]Get away from me.
[69:41.94]I should just start with that.
[69:45.56]Alright.
[69:46.20]I'm going to put that in because it makes sense.
[69:54.96]And subscribe.
[70:09.54]Alright, that works too.
[70:15.94]We need people getting hurt.
[70:16.98]I'm running out of space here.
[70:20.86]That's so fucking loud.
[70:37.54]Alright, we're done with that.
[70:38.70]I'm not adding a bunch of fucking stupid sounds to ruin the movie.
[70:42.12]Delete this.
[70:45.67]We do this every single time.
[70:47.27]Every single time I put these stupid fucking sounds here and it just ruins the first ten minutes of the movie.
[70:51.47]Ten minutes.
[70:58.67]I'm so sorry.
[71:00.19]Alright.
[71:00.71]And then we need to...
[71:06.39]We need people screaming.
[71:07.73]Apparently this guy doesn't even care.
[71:23.28]Whoever's filming this with their iPhone camera doesn't seem to give a shit.
[71:26.92]He's outside of his window doing a panorama and he's like, whatever, who cares?
[71:30.92]Who gives a shit?
[71:35.68]And we need a... That's good.
[71:46.57]One more.
[71:58.62]This is so loud, man.
[72:00.80]Ah!
[72:05.95]Is that the same one I just did?
[72:07.97]Probably.
[72:08.43]There's nobody here.
[72:12.87]There's no other actors here.
[72:15.03]What the fuck?
[72:17.47]It's just a rabbit falling down.
[72:19.23]What the fuck is that?
[72:24.47]Okay, I fucked up again.
[72:25.71]Of course I did.
[72:28.38]Of course I did.
[72:29.08]Why wouldn't I fuck it up?
[72:43.53]I need breathing.
[72:50.05]Yeah, okay.
[72:51.47]Add some screams.
[72:57.61]Whoa!
[73:12.61]No.
[73:13.63]I've already done that joke where there's not supposed to be something where you... It's the same guy.
[73:23.86]The same guy that doesn't even care he's still filming this with his iPhone.
[73:40.01]What is it?
[73:41.16]Oh, right.
[73:42.00]Why does this look like shit?
[73:48.36]I forgot about that.
[73:51.44]I forgot about that.
[73:57.05]This is arm breaking.
[74:02.31]He catches the hand.
[74:05.43]So, like, right...
[74:08.76]Here, break.
[74:10.20]Snaps his fucking arm.
[74:13.02]And I have to have like... Nope, I'm not putting it in.
[74:27.97]I am not putting a fart in this fucking movie, I swear to God.
[74:32.21]Not doing that again.
[74:33.07]It's in every movie.
[74:35.02]No, no, no, no.
[74:37.62]What?
[74:47.60]Is there already a punch?
[74:54.01]Record a fart in real life?
[74:55.39]I don't have to.
[74:55.95]And then there's gonna be a gunshot right here.
[75:21.06]Gunshot, gunshot.
[75:22.20]Come on, where's the guns?
[75:23.78]Give me a gun.
[75:28.28]Explosion.
[75:29.02]No, that's not what I want.
[75:33.46]Weapon sound.
[75:33.98]There we go.
[75:42.41]This is one bullet.
[75:45.67]One bullet hits him and it kills him.
[75:50.37]I don't even fucking know what these... Okay, we're getting real fucking weird.
[75:54.63]Alright, let's just... No, we need another song.
[76:01.20]I don't even know what this one is.
[76:16.31]Turn this shit down!
[76:33.45]Lord.
[76:34.99]All out action.
[76:35.85]Let's try this one.

[76:51.49]Alright, all out action.
[76:56.29]And we get to here.
[76:57.09]And this is where we need some happy music.
[77:13.46]Okay, that's good.
[77:17.20]And that's it.
[77:18.17]We gotta add a couple more sounds.
[77:19.45]Hold on.
[77:42.00]Okay.
[77:44.46]This guy is filming again.
[77:45.66]He's just like, ah, whatever.
[77:46.54]I don't give a shit.
[77:57.32]Alright.

[89:02.22]Well, I never even saw Twilight.
[89:04.55]I'm assuming it sucks.
[89:06.61]Probably does.
[89:08.07]That's the joke, right?

[89:43.50]Thank you for the thousand bits.

[90:03.24]I appreciate that.
[90:03.90]You don't have to do that, though.
[90:06.95]And alright, let's keep going.
[90:10.41]Sorry, I need like another tea or coffee or something.
[90:12.69]My throat is killing me.
[90:15.86]Alright, guys, let's make another one.
[90:18.08]This time, I'm going to make a poll for the next movie we're going to make.
[90:25.24]And you guys are going to vote on whatever.
[90:27.19]This is what we're going to do next.
[90:29.27]What kind of movie?
[90:33.43]I'm just going to give like three different potential ideas.
[90:40.00]Uh... Trouble... Alright, this one's gonna be called... Uh, this one's gonna be called Time... No, Relative Time.
[91:06.98]Relative Time is gonna be like a time travel movie.
[91:12.31]singe singe is gonna be a horror movie singe relative time will be time travel or for my darling Cynthia and I guess you can guess that but that's gonna be that's gonna be a romance alright here's your choices
[91:43.21]Grateful.
[91:45.13]Take your pick what you'd like to see.
[91:50.71]What is the next movie?
[91:55.13]Beer.
[91:55.88]Went to sleep at 6 p.m.
[91:56.90]and woke up at 2 a.m.
[91:57.66]so I could watch your stream.
[91:58.62]Well, thanks, Gusty.
[92:00.32]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[92:03.84]What is the next movie?
[92:10.76]Who knows?
[92:15.71]Who knows?
[92:17.19]It looks like.
[92:25.07]How come I can't see the results of this?
[92:31.14]Yeah, I don't see any results.
[92:32.44]That's weird.
[92:36.06]Did it not show up in the chat?
[92:37.22]What the fuck is going on?
[92:40.16]No link.
[92:40.72]What?
[92:41.14]I just linked it like 10 times.
[92:43.12]What?
[92:45.15]Alright, Twitch.
[92:46.36]That doesn't make any sense.
[92:47.20]Can you see that?
[92:51.32]I just scrolled up.
[92:53.26]It's in the chat like five times.
[92:54.46]There's nothing.
[92:55.62]You can't see anything I'm writing.
[92:58.70]What?
[92:59.76]Can you guys see this?
[93:04.12]Did you guys just see how I just wrote hello?
[93:07.81]Well, what the fuck?
[93:09.15]How come it won't show the link?
[93:18.54]What?
[93:24.10]It showed up.
[93:25.58]I still can't see any... That's really weird.
[93:33.11]So you can see it now.
[93:34.85]Okay, that was fucking really weird.
[93:40.51]Huge chat delay.
[93:41.27]Well, no, I was writing it over and over again.
[93:44.03]The link just wasn't... I couldn't... The message wasn't going through chat.
[93:46.68]That was weird.
[93:52.17]Looks like relative time is going to win.
[93:53.77]Actually, this is pretty close.
[93:59.10]It's closer than I thought it was going to be.
[94:04.14]Time travel.
[94:04.82]That's going to be so hard to make.
[94:07.60]It's going to be impossible to make a time travel movie.
[94:14.25]Still no pull.
[94:15.51]I have no idea.
[94:17.65]No option for Rat Movie 3.
[94:18.57]If I'm going to make Rat Movie 3, I'm going to make it in 3D Movie Maker where it belongs.
[94:27.22]Another like 10 seconds or so.
[94:28.40]And we're going to make Relative Time.
[94:32.88]Unless Singe can somehow make up for the fact that Relative Time is kind of kicking ass.
[94:45.92]Like any of the other movies, we're coherent.
[94:47.90]Yeah, but now I have to be incoherent to be coherent in a time travel movie.
[94:54.07]Alright, 10 seconds and it's over.
[94:55.95]Relative time it is.
[94:57.09]We can use the sci-fi sets.
[95:06.61]Alright, that's it.
[95:08.78]Relative time it is.
[95:09.46]We're making a time travel movie.
[95:10.70]Thank you for voting.
[95:11.92]Much appreciated.
[95:18.26]When does Cementoads take Manhattan?
[95:21.92]Never.
[95:24.89]Okay.
[95:26.09]So, I guess we're going to use the sci-fi set.
[95:28.59]That would make the most sense.
[95:34.09]At least personally, I think that would make the most sense.
[95:38.69]So, let's go.
[95:41.86]We need to go to the script office.
[95:43.32]Advanced movie making.
[95:45.30]Advanced movie maker.
[95:46.24]Rear.
[95:49.50]This is a sci-fi movie, Relative Time.
[95:56.08]Freeform.
[95:56.66]Okay, it's starring me.
[96:01.61]I'm the lead role in this one, guys.
[96:05.67]And Barry will be a supporting actor for this one.
[96:09.91]And where's Hank?
[96:13.37]Where's Hank?
[96:15.38]Oh, here's Harold Sludge.
[96:17.76]Harold Sludge.
[96:19.36]Gotta get some cool sci-fi outfits.
[96:24.56]Let's see.
[96:25.72]Casual, formal work.
[96:26.92]Underwear, monster, futuristic.
[96:28.60]Here we go.
[96:35.65]Alright.
[96:38.55]Alright.
[96:39.23]I love this game.
[96:41.59]Here we go.
[96:43.11]Here.
[96:43.97]We start with the future.
[96:46.54]This is me in the future.
[96:47.42]That's fine.
[96:48.90]Yeah, of course, I got to be a little bit older.
[96:51.03]Gained a little bit of weight.
[96:55.01]Sporting actor.
[96:55.69]He's going to be also in... Futuristic.
[97:10.07]Why is a space officer uniform like a Civil War outfit?
[97:15.02]Don't ask me why.
[97:15.86]There we go.
[97:18.04]He's just being a stupid Star Trek rip-off shirt.
[97:24.01]He's fucking weird looking.
[97:29.17]And this last one.
[97:37.74]Gotta have an alien, right?
[97:47.11]Why is there an alien in this?
[97:48.11]I don't know.
[97:51.73]Alright.
[97:52.75]So.
[97:54.01]Time travel.
[97:54.75]We're in the future.
[97:55.35]We're going to have to go to... No.
[98:00.35]See, I'm going to pull a fucking Christopher Nolan on you guys.
[98:02.33]I'm going to pull a Christopher Nolan on you guys.
[98:09.79]We're starting at the end of the movie.
[98:10.75]Yep.
[98:10.83]And then we're going to have to figure out what happened.
[98:20.03]Yeah, here we go.
[98:20.51]This is the beginning of the movie.
[98:21.52]We have to figure out, like, why things are happening like this.
[98:30.76]That's fucking stupid looking.
[98:37.43]This is going to be, like, intense music right here.
[98:39.97]I'm, like, running on the rooftops.
[98:41.47]And this is, like, not really even the future, is it?
[98:54.65]Okay.
[99:24.67]Fall forwards, fall backwards, stay down, get up.
[99:32.64]Get up really slow.
[99:36.39]All stunts.
[99:38.59]No, this is like the end.
[99:39.67]This is like somebody's after him, but why, you know?
[99:56.30]another jump fire low run through the fire fire trap jump escape okay here we go skill novice object type pistol
[100:27.52]Who's screaming?
[100:30.50]Why?
[100:30.86]What?
[100:34.25]This has to be the alien.
[100:44.97]Why does he keep screaming like that?
[100:46.57]Okay.
[100:53.22]Rooftop.
[100:56.83]Now we need... I die here.
[100:59.50]Spoiler alert, guys.
[101:00.34]I die.
[101:18.07]Leap bound fast.
[101:19.73]Let's see.
[101:29.40]Yeah, that's him.
[101:30.90]I like this one.
[101:31.48]Okay.
[101:50.99]And then, oh no, I'm on the ground.
[101:52.39]I'm on the fucking ground.
[101:53.87]What do I do?
[102:14.36]Embarrassed, bestial, armed.
[102:17.08]No, bestial.
[102:20.42]Except this one has to be this one.
[102:27.68]I can't tell if that's me making that noise or the alien.
[102:38.21]Embarrassed?
[102:39.11]No, terrified.
[102:50.18]And then it's gonna freeze.
[102:51.46]And I'm gonna come in with a voiceover and go, how did we get here?
[102:55.26]Well, we're gonna have to start at the very beginning.
[102:58.48]Okay, so I need that.
[102:59.30]I need um, how do I take like a screenshot?
[103:08.56]Stage.
[103:11.47]I don't know how to take a screenshot.
[103:12.49]Let's do another scene.
[103:15.55]Where it's just like a long blank stare.
[103:22.13]Rooftop.
[103:22.59]I wonder if I can just do static.
[103:23.91]Yeah.
[103:24.57]Static.
[103:41.92]I want to just put somebody in there, though.
[103:44.72]Can I?
[103:48.06]Just do an establishing shot, yeah.
[103:50.21]Like a crane shot.
[103:53.15]Actually, I probably will just do a crane.
[104:06.91]You're probably wondering, how did I get here?
[104:09.45]Well, we're gonna find out right now.
[104:10.23]We're gonna go... It's, like, so short.
[104:12.21]I'm gonna have to put, like, another one in.
[104:40.45]Fucking on his groin.
[104:45.33]Perspective.
[104:46.17]There we go.
[104:48.51]Wait, what?
[104:51.89]I want to be on his face.
[105:04.66]Why is it showing my ass?
[105:08.28]Alright, time to fucking move the damn camera.
[105:13.58]Oh, this is perfect.
[105:14.32]He's just contemplating.
[105:16.80]Right there.
[105:19.66]Huge field of view.
[105:21.34]Oh, no.
[105:21.84]No, no, no.
[105:23.28]There we go.
[105:31.39]Alright, good.
[105:31.77]I'm going to take out... This is going to be hard to do, actually.
[105:42.85]Alright, good.
[105:43.21]This is gonna be a great fucking movie.
[105:47.71]Alright, so now we're back at the beginning.
[105:51.07]In my... In the subway.
[105:54.25]It all happened because of the subway.
[105:55.73]Like, I fucking jumped into a portal or something on the subway.
[106:03.84]Traveling.
[106:06.08]No, no fire.
[106:06.92]No, no, no.
[106:09.59]Subway sit.
[106:11.77]Subway passenger sits down in the seat in the left of the carriage.
[106:13.87]Yeah, I can like talk.
[106:18.84]I can't be in these clothes though.
[106:22.10]And I gotta be like not, I gotta be small.
[106:25.42]Why am I so fat?
[106:37.63]No, I don't want to be in a military outfit.
[106:43.10]Casual.
[106:44.90]There we go.
[106:45.48]There we go.
[106:46.06]Yeah, that's what I wear every day.
[106:47.22]That was just a regular guy.
[106:54.99]Doing regular guy things.
[107:08.66]My life changed forever.
[107:09.66]Okay, subway.
[107:18.87]Subway station.
[107:20.97]And here they come.
[107:26.21]Hold on, pick up weapon.
[107:27.23]No, we need like a portal or something.
[107:30.96]How am I gonna do this?
[107:36.13]Enter scanner?
[107:37.79]Yeah, perfect.
[107:44.87]That's Barry.
[107:48.99]He's looking for me.
[107:55.34]That's fucking so bad.
[108:12.05]And then he's probably like the union of federal investigators or something.
[108:18.27]Wrong outfit again.
[108:19.03]Okay, arrest.
[108:33.00]I gotta have me coming off the train.
[108:42.06]Okay, he's just in this now.
[108:43.94]He's just in the movie now.
[108:49.11]Alright, here we go.
[108:52.19]He just comes in.
[108:54.89]They're like magnums.
[109:01.72]And then I can throw it.
[109:02.36]Okay.
[109:08.90]Of course the alien's going to show up.
[109:10.42]Of course he will.
[109:13.10]I need me getting off the train.
[109:20.55]This wasn't going to be coherent.
[109:22.05]I'm telling you right now.
[109:22.77]Okay, I just need to have me walk off.
[109:30.21]Walk and talk to enter.
[109:31.57]Soldiers enter.
[109:36.46]Oh, fuck it.
[109:36.98]Whatever.
[109:37.54]They just have me now.
[109:49.03]Sure it is.
[109:49.77]No, it's going to make sense.
[109:53.45]Where did they even take me?
[109:59.73]No, I like the fact that I'm just kind of sitting on him like, okay, this makes sense.
[110:07.35]Alright, now we need a... Yeah, it's underneath the government building.
[110:15.79]Of course it is.
[110:23.11]Of course it is.
[110:33.35]Fight?
[110:33.81]No.
[110:37.38]Plank comedy?
[110:40.28]That doesn't work.
[110:43.60]No.
[110:43.86]Should I just put plank comedy here?
[111:01.11]Why are these people just kissing?
[111:02.45]Yeah, I get taken to court.
[111:17.42]Yeah, you gotta have a little bit of comedy.
[111:19.16]Okay, now this is...
[111:31.10]It's already off the rails.
[111:32.66]It's already off the rails.
[111:36.40]I want to make a coherent story, but I can't.
[111:43.88]It's too fun to make people just do shit.
[111:50.48]Where were we?
[111:51.88]This is the only stupid joke that's going to be in.
[111:53.64]Now we're back to fucking normal.
[111:56.94]Now they're inside.
[112:01.95]No, this is a bank.
[112:03.69]This is not correct.
[112:10.72]Yeah, but how do you know?
[112:12.58]How the fuck do you know?
[112:13.34]This is a time travel movie.
[112:14.64]That could have happened like fucking a year ago when they were friends.
[112:18.54]Well, got you there, don't I?
[112:24.38]Yeah, got you here, don't I?
[112:25.60]We're going to a bar.
[112:37.83]Yep, and now it's old me again.
[112:39.37]This is so long and so stupid.
[113:03.75]What the fuck is he doing?
[113:06.79]What is he doing?
[113:08.43]What is he doing?
[113:15.76]Okay.
[113:28.65]What time frame is this?
[113:44.82]Is this a random guy?
[113:46.44]Okay, this has to be just a random guy.
[113:55.54]Yeah, what time frame are we in right now?
[114:08.66]Is this a phone ringing?
[114:13.12]Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[114:19.41]And you know, that person has to be in a fucking chicken suit or something.
[114:31.45]No, this is like space alien shit.
[114:33.51]It's gonna be like a fucking auto-robot person.
[114:44.59]It's like, who is his friend?
[114:52.80]More brawl in the bar.
[115:05.20]Why is he smiling?
[115:06.10]That's so creepy.
[115:07.66]What the fuck?
[115:13.36]This is just the alien.
[115:30.81]No, that has to be the person in the robot costume.
[115:35.07]That is the person in the robot costume.
[115:51.70]Why would a fucking robot be drinking?
[115:53.68]This is the future, man!
[115:54.56]No, fuck!
[115:55.64]Whoops!
[115:58.82]What happened here?
[115:59.66]This is supposed to be me.
[116:06.26]Here we go.
[116:12.33]Why?
[116:12.53]Did I, like, change costumes?
[116:16.01]Hold on.
[116:16.59]What the fuck is going on here?
[116:21.64]Okay, yeah.
[116:24.12]Alien fights me.
[116:26.08]Yeah, smash.
[116:26.85]Alright.
[116:31.55]Yeah, okay.
[116:32.15]So what the fuck is the problem?
[116:36.11]This is not supposed to be me.
[116:37.05]This is supposed to be like extra number one.
[116:45.48]Wrong timeline.
[116:46.18]Yeah, we're going all over the place with timelines.
[116:48.20]You guys wanted a time travel movie.
[116:49.34]You're going to get it.
[116:59.41]And I'm going to be back here reacting.
[117:00.85]Okay, then I attack him.
[117:28.81]We need violence.
[117:30.93]Brawl 1.
[117:31.65]There's more?
[117:32.11]There's Brawl 2?
[117:32.93]If there's a Brawl 2, then oh my god, we have to have Brawl 2.
[117:38.97]Give money?
[117:39.63]I should pay him some money?
[117:40.72]No.
[117:40.82]Somebody comes with an axe.
[117:52.52]Fight zombies.
[117:52.94]Fight zombies.
[117:57.74]Why would you fire blanks?
[118:05.74]Guns sneak by.
[118:08.44]And then we're going to go back to the other timeline.
[118:16.82]Ass kick, crouch, shoot.
[118:21.31]Fight monster.
[118:27.27]Hold on, I want to see.
[118:29.75]Let's just go with Brawl.
[118:32.23]Brawl 1.
[118:32.71]It's just Brawl 1.
[118:34.35]God damn it.
[118:36.05]It's not Brawl 2?
[118:36.59]Oh!
[118:36.65]Whoa!
[118:51.08]These guys are so bad at shooting.
[118:53.14]No death.
[118:53.74]Oh, bar staff die.
[118:55.75]Okay, bar staff die.
[118:58.15]What?
[119:09.67]Yeah, because he was thrown over there.
[119:14.97]Okay, what the fuck?
[119:22.71]This is not... He needs to be over here.
[119:26.49]So Barry needs to be over here because he got thrown.
[119:29.23]Okay.
[119:33.83]Where's Barry?
[119:35.42]Barry needs to be this guy.
[119:39.02]And then the extra is this guy.
[119:48.18]I shot first.
[120:03.10]Okay, he was already back there.
[120:04.28]He's like, I'm fucking done, guys.
[120:05.88]Don't shoot me.
[120:06.92]Alright, who the fuck is this?
[120:10.66]Who the fuck is this guy?
[120:13.18]Okay, well, another alien is just right here.
[120:14.94]This guy's dead.
[120:19.24]Because we're in Tatooine, you know what I mean?
[120:21.54]We're in a Star Wars bar.
[120:35.46]Who shot first?
[120:43.49]Why is this robot guy my new best friend?
[120:56.03]They have to shoot this guy now, right?
[120:57.27]Alright, bang.
[121:02.29]Back to the municipal building.
[121:17.65]Hey, look at this.
[121:18.07]What time frame are we in now, guys?
[121:19.47]I love how we're doing this outside the municipal building.
[121:45.39]We're in the other movie.
[121:51.77]Why are there all these kissing noises?
[122:03.18]They're not even touching each other.
[122:05.78]No, I don't like that.
[122:06.42]We need to have like a judge or something.
[122:16.04]Crane feature?
[122:25.84]Fireman exit?
[122:27.08]Exit briefcase?
[122:28.24]No.
[122:36.63]I can't do this, but I want to.
[122:38.39]I have to.
[122:49.38]No, I don't have to.
[122:51.80]I know what I'm doing.
[123:01.40]That's what this was.
[123:04.14]We got married.
[123:04.76]And he was the pastor, and they were coming to get me.
[123:10.88]That doesn't make any fucking sense either.
[123:12.26]No, that doesn't make any sense.
[123:23.32]No, this is gonna... Back out here.
[123:34.25]VIP demands.
[123:38.27]Murder scene?
[123:38.91]Let's see what murder scene is.
[123:46.92]Wait, this makes sense because I did hit him in the head with the fucking brick.
[123:50.32]I hit him in the head with...
[123:53.10]Why am I taking pictures?
[123:58.26]No, this has to be this person.
[124:02.05]Because I did hit him in the head with a fucking log.
[124:04.19]I like this.
[124:17.63]Who cares?
[124:18.19]He seems like a detective.
[124:31.70]See, he's like, you don't know what happened.
[124:33.25]I'm not even sure.
[124:33.95]He got hit with a fucking log.
[124:35.97]No, I need a monster.
[125:10.11]I'm in the wrong clothes.
[125:21.18]Gorilla detective.
[125:23.12]Okay, fine.
[125:25.54]Might as well go totally off the fucking rail.
[125:32.49]You know, this game, it's so hard to keep track of all the scenes because they're just these like little squares.
[125:54.56]Back on the roof.
[125:56.88]Back on the rooftop.
[126:06.29]We need like a knife fight up here.
[126:11.83]Violence.
[126:17.52]This fight?
[126:18.08]No.
[126:18.28]Yeah, this fight.
[126:19.02]This fight will do.
[126:29.62]Was I in these clothes?
[126:43.51]This fight sucks.
[126:44.83]Gentle?
[126:45.39]No, we need, like, heavy fighting.
[126:52.55]Time travel.
[126:59.51]Yeah, a good time travel movie.
[127:03.14]All we're doing is seeing different timelines.
[127:04.94]I was talking about balancing dreams and dreams.
[127:14.34]What about extreme?
[127:32.03]This is not even that extreme.
[127:33.29]What about heavy?
[127:39.35]I like heavy the best.
[127:41.29]Because it has like the shit talk.
[127:44.80]I like the shit talk.
[127:46.62]Hey, you wanna tell me something?
[127:47.38]I'll tell you.
[127:50.97]Okay, now we're still on the rooftop.
[128:17.85]This is a different room Now we need the mothership to come in The mothership is gonna come in and shoot Where is it?
[128:37.69]It's a tiny little city corridor We needed to come in before that
[128:50.91]Street jungle.
[128:51.85]Where is it?
[128:58.58]Do I want to do that or do I want to do that?
[129:01.10]I'll do that.
[129:01.54]Fine.
[129:01.94]That makes more sense.
[129:04.88]Mothership arrives.
[129:08.66]Oh, shit.
[129:18.09]Yeah, that's better.
[129:24.03]And that's going to come in before they even fight.
[129:28.75]Mothership's going to shoot.
[129:39.15]Mothership attacks.
[129:48.24]Come on.
[129:56.86]And then he gets exploded.
[129:58.02]Okay.
[129:59.28]And then I need him, like, falling.
[130:04.85]This is gonna be so fucking bad.
[130:10.51]This is going to be terrible.
[130:14.16]Oh my god, no it isn't.
[130:15.28]What?
[130:20.12]What?
[130:37.66]It has to be me.
[130:46.28]Look at the way I'm falling.
[130:47.24]Alright, and then we're going to go from here to this one.
[131:04.55]No, not fall.
[131:05.57]Where is it?
[131:08.25]It's when you just like hit your face on the ground.
[131:17.92]Is it drop van drop off?
[131:21.30]No.
[131:21.50]I think it's head impact.
[131:26.18]Yeah, there it is.
[131:48.77]I like that when the message is like, WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?!
[131:51.41]I'm gonna need the, um, smother sh-

[134:35.90]And... Um... Gabe DeGrossi.
[134:45.18]We've connected the two movies.
[135:02.15]Helicopter formation.
[135:03.29]It's a spin-off.
[135:07.97]Now we get to see what actually happened.
[135:13.72]I don't like this one.
[135:23.64]Yeah, we're just going to put this one in.
[135:34.74]I think it has to be, like, an extra.
[135:39.55]What?
[135:39.87]Come on.
[135:43.51]Come on, what are you doing?
[135:52.16]Alright, we'll just pretend that this was the fucking monster.
[135:54.48]Because I can't, like... Oh, there we go.
[136:03.24]And then we're going to go back to the... We're going to go back to the very beginning, the subway.
[136:11.70]Where is it?
[136:12.13]It's like the English Bobby.
[136:21.99]Whatever.
[136:22.57]You just see the boots walking.
[136:31.60]Back to the subway.
[136:40.00]No, back to the alien world.
[136:52.93]Yep.
[136:53.69]Except I need to... This has to be me.
[136:57.64]Back in time, because remember they took me from the subway.
[137:15.19]Where is it?
[137:18.48]Where is it?
[137:19.00]It's just like the general, like, see, there it is.

[137:46.79]Yep.
[137:51.09]And what is this?
[137:51.67]This is back in time.
[137:52.89]Who the fuck is this?
[137:58.94]Who's this, like, regular-sized guy back in time?
[138:01.87]It's gonna be Dr. Roker.
[138:13.00]You guys think I could do a time travel movie?
[138:24.58]He has to be in like the Sith Lord.
[138:30.37]Can I get regular fucking glasses?
[138:32.93]Where's his mustache?
[138:35.83]Where are his fucking features?
[138:58.99]Yeah, he's in the mysterious.
[139:00.05]This needs to be an alien.
[139:21.25]Okay.
[139:25.47]We're still here.
[139:26.53]Alien world.
[139:29.11]This is when I fucking fight for my life.
[139:35.41]This is when I fight for my life.
[139:37.61]This guy didn't get out of the car yet.
[139:48.82]I put the bomb there when I was in the car.
[139:57.72]By the way, it was a taxi.
[140:02.26]Was it a taxi?
[140:07.72]Yeah, and then everyone freaks out and that's when the big fight is back in time.
[140:12.28]But I lose.
[140:16.41]Surprise attack.
[140:23.31]No, fuck, that's the wrong one.
[140:36.09]I'm just on a horse.
[140:38.95]Hold on.
[140:39.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[140:40.31]It is more.
[140:41.81]Soldiers attack.
[140:46.71]Soldiers attack.
[140:47.70]It's just all aliens.
[140:56.40]No, no, no.
[140:56.86]I don't like that one.
[140:57.62]Let's go down to the bottom.

[141:41.45]Like Dr. Oak was like, what the fuck was that?
[141:44.74]And then I pulled the knife.
[142:08.43]And then we get in the knife fight.
[142:11.84]This is all over the place again.
[142:13.54]I love it.
[142:16.70]Alien world fucking knife fight.
[142:27.95]What the fuck is going on with their hair?
[142:33.97]I don't understand the hair.
[142:42.98]Wait, his mustache is gone?
[142:44.20]This doesn't look like me at all.
[142:49.14]What the fuck happened?
[142:52.20]Why is this?
[142:52.68]No, this is Dr. Ochre's in my clothes.
[143:01.17]Oh, fuck.
[143:01.77]Whoops.
[143:04.57]Okay, well, this is supposed to be my clothes.
[143:22.52]What happened to his mustache?
[143:23.82]What happened to his hair?
[143:25.00]Yeah, it turns out it's just me.
[143:35.18]It was me.
[143:40.44]Oh, did he get him?
[143:42.35]He got him.
[143:42.83]But who got who?
[143:46.16]No, we gotta switch this around.
[143:46.98]I love how he changes fucking clothes every time.
[143:58.27]Like his face changes too.
[144:10.01]No, fucking come on.
[144:12.83]Should I have the alien head?
[144:13.71]Because it's like... No.
[144:20.30]Where does he get these glasses?
[144:25.35]Yeah, this is just like the plot from Jumper.
[144:36.20]Watch this.
[144:36.66]Ready?
[144:38.12]Dead.
[144:40.44]But guess what?
[144:41.80]This is the real me.
[144:43.08]And now we're back in... Now we're gonna go back to fucking the...
[144:50.72]Then this one aged on the alien planet and became the Dr. Elker that destroys the city.
[145:03.51]Okay, now we're back.
[145:04.41]Now we're going to go to the Starship Bridge.
[145:08.55]Because now we're going back into the real time.
[145:10.99]So this is inside the bridge.
[145:23.80]OK, we're going to have.
[145:29.00]Wrecked bridge.
[145:31.34]Take photo.
[145:35.58]Captain Hero.
[145:41.89]Yep.
[145:43.91]OK, so this is got to be me from the past.
[145:49.81]Who is now turned into.
[145:52.93]This is the Doctor Ultra me.
[145:55.17]This is the not me.
[145:56.41]No, wait.
[145:56.87]I'm confused.
[145:57.65]That's the real me.
[145:59.93]This is the cat.
[146:00.40]There we go.
[146:00.72]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[146:01.54]Okay.
[146:03.24]No, no.
[146:03.80]It's just an alien.
[146:07.74]These are all aliens.
[146:17.38]It's just they're all clapping.
[146:18.64]Yeah, we're destroying Earth.
[146:20.30]It's fucking great.
[146:21.15]It's fantastic.
[146:43.69]I don't think I can do anything else here besides, like, have the ship explode.
[146:51.51]Okay, now I want you to be an alien.
[146:54.31]There's one random lady here.
[146:57.73]I'm confused.
[146:58.59]Hey, guess what?
[146:59.31]So am I. Alright, here.
[147:04.45]No, let's keep changing.
[147:07.05]I don't want you... Listen, lady.
[147:10.69]You're supposed to be...
[147:14.36]I don't care.
[147:14.80]There's one random guy who gives a shit.
[147:17.14]Alright, where's like explosion?
[147:34.81]So I can show me shooting like a rocket launcher.
[147:44.18]There's no explosion on the ship.
[147:47.35]There's explosion reaction.
[147:53.31]Okay.
[148:00.56]Now that I have a big shot and made it into the donkeys video, what's the next step?
[148:05.56]I don't know.
[148:06.54]Is there a next step?
[148:16.13]Okay, now we need me shooting the rocket launcher.
[148:20.21]Is there even a rocket launcher?
[148:23.03]I don't think there is a rocket launcher.
[148:29.76]Let me look at miniature city.
[148:30.74]Is there like a... There has to be something.
[148:37.40]Helicopter leaves?
[148:39.62]No.
[148:42.37]Monster confrontation...
[148:46.53]I don't think there's like a mothership battle involved in a battle.
[148:51.07]What though?
[148:55.66]Maybe I can have it just explode?
[149:07.85]Not really.
[149:08.43]Uh, not really.
[149:16.78]I need to have me, like, okay, I'm gonna have the character on the bottom shoot like a gun.
[149:23.14]And then that's it.
[149:41.75]Car shootout.
[149:43.33]Here come the gorillas again.
[149:49.45]No nothing else because they have to be driving No, we need I just need to like shoot shoot gun shoot gun, I guess I can like change it, right This is gonna be so lame
[150:20.96]Uzi shotgun rifle.
[150:43.25]The gorilla drives by and shoots it.
[150:44.81]Oh, well, we'll see what that looks like.
[150:55.54]Don't worry, I got the gorilla in the car.
[150:56.98]I'm not gonna miss that one for sure.
[151:04.73]Who's making that noise?
[151:05.79]Okay, this is when they're clapping.
[151:23.89]And then this is...
[151:26.55]Yeah, the city's being destroyed, and then it explodes.
[151:33.20]Let's just see what it looks like when we do this.
[151:37.38]This is such a mess.
[151:39.60]This is going to be so fucking messy that it's going to be completely incoherent, but it's time travel, so it doesn't matter.
[151:48.83]Traveling vehicle.
[151:49.73]No, where was it?
[151:50.27]It was a city, right?
[151:54.28]Should I go back to the Starship Bridge?
[151:55.78]No, no, no, no.
[152:12.25]That's so stupid.
[152:16.51]Fast stop.
[152:58.27]Dammit, this sucks.
[153:02.73]Well, if somebody's driving a car, they have to be in the gorilla costume.
[153:07.28]Oh no, it's just gonna be aliens this time.
[153:13.36]No, then they're gonna get an accident.
[153:17.06]Oh, for the love of God.
[153:23.71]Son of a bitch.
[153:24.65]Am I actually gonna do this?
[153:33.43]Why do they always have to be driving the car?
[153:36.05]And why are they about to go get in an accident?
[153:39.19]Right after this.
[153:39.83]And then... And then they just crash.
[153:58.78]No, this is perfect.
[153:59.46]This is perfect.
[153:59.92]This is going to explain the beginning.
[154:12.47]There's no rhyme or reason to this shit.
[154:15.02]And why is he driving the other car?
[154:18.54]Why is the alien driving the other car?
[154:22.46]Did they get in two different cars?
[154:25.08]They got in two different fucking cars?
[154:33.71]God fucking dammit.
[154:36.87]Now they're just in two different cars.
[154:39.39]Wait, what?
[154:43.27]It's the crash from the other movie!
[154:49.26]Wait, what?
[154:50.40]It's the crash from the other movie.
[155:19.30]But he's not even driving the car.
[155:22.04]He's not even fucking driving the car.
[155:24.18]It's the alien.
[155:25.90]No, wait.
[155:26.86]What happened?
[155:32.68]I wish I could put a guy in here.
[155:34.85]I wish I could put a fucking passenger right here so it could be the alien.
[155:38.87]So badly.
[155:40.87]So fucking badly.
[155:42.01]I wish that could be an alien in the car with him.
[155:45.91]Ugh.
[155:48.58]I wish there was a guy in that fucking cab.
[155:50.70]Can I please put him in there?
[155:53.58]I can't.
[155:55.08]Just assume that this is an alien in this car.
[155:57.68]Okay, the alien gets out of that car and chases him.
[156:21.60]And then we have the beginning of the movie.
[156:24.34]Oh my god.
[156:28.45]My fucking god.
[156:37.27]This is too much for me, man.
[156:38.53]It really is.
[156:39.65]This shit is fucking too much for me to fucking handle.
[156:46.92]Alright, so we need the gorilla is here.
[156:50.30]Alien gets out and chases me, and that's the beginning of the movie.
[156:59.18]My fucking god, that's too funny.
[157:14.18]Why is... This, like, stupid gorilla suit joke, I don't think will ever get old to me.
[157:29.33]I love that he's not dead either.
[157:30.51]Wait, why does he get out of the car?
[157:45.37]I don't want them to both get out.
[157:55.39]Whatever.
[157:56.45]It doesn't fucking matter at this point.
[157:58.57]And then here comes the chase.
[157:59.63]And this is the beginning of the movie.
[158:22.80]Oh, come on.
[158:23.46]I can't reach that far.
[158:27.54]Alright, and then and then this is it this is the fucking end I'm done.
[158:48.47]I can't do it anymore.
[158:49.35]My brain is gonna explode It's too much
[159:06.98]Why does he have a shitty police whistle?
[159:11.38]No, what?
[159:38.20]It's not supposed to be the gorilla, it's supposed to be the alien!
[159:40.46]Oh, what the fuck is going on here?
[160:01.08]It's always the same damn orange car, I know.
[160:03.64]It's fucking too much for my brain.
[160:10.99]Okay, like this.
[160:11.59]Come on.
[160:11.93]This person right here.
[160:14.68]You.
[160:16.02]There.
[160:16.22]I have just too many scenes and it's so incoherent, guys.
[160:20.20]I don't know.
[160:20.70]Can I even do post-production to this fucking thing?
[160:23.53]I don't think so.
[160:26.89]It's too... It's all over the place.
[160:28.09]It's wicked long.
[160:28.79]It's wicked awful.
[160:29.67]This is... This is the last one.
[160:32.05]I can't make another one after this one.
[160:33.42]At least for a while.
[161:09.30]No.
[161:46.39]No, I can't do this again.
[161:49.19]I've said that so many times, but honest to fucking God, I can't do this shit anymore.
[161:54.98]It's not gonna happen again.
[161:56.26]This is the end of the movie.
[162:09.23]I don't think I can follow what's going on.
[162:12.49]This is awful.
[162:13.23]That was an alien driving the car.
[162:22.44]Wait, no, no, we gotta change props here.
[162:28.30]Nope.
[162:29.48]That one needs to be the orange one.
[162:48.57]No, we end where the other one left off.
[162:52.55]Where the fuck did that end up even?
[162:54.41]I don't even know.
[162:54.89]It was the rooftop one, right?
[163:00.05]What happened?
[163:00.37]What was the last thing on the roof?
[163:02.31]Oh, it was me being like, oh, yeah, but here's my story.
[163:08.29]Okay, so...
[163:12.26]It has to end with, on the roof, the alien getting killed.
[163:18.86]Rooftop.
[163:19.44]This is the last scene.
[163:20.98]And then we can put a wrap on it.
[163:42.81]No, I don't like that.
[163:44.69]Gorilla reading a book?
[163:45.67]No, there's already too many gorillas.
[163:47.34]There's way too many gorillas in this movie.
[164:20.69]What's the big surprise ending?
[164:22.68]After the mothership explodes.
[164:26.03]He just chokes the alien to death and throws it on the ground.
[164:28.23]The end.
[164:50.30]No gorilla reading the book?
[164:51.74]What?
[164:52.82]No, no gorillas reading the book.
[164:54.73]We can't end it like that.
[165:00.28]Here's how we'll end it.
[165:24.54]This is a dream.
[165:25.06]It was a dream by this guy, Barry.
[165:28.98]Who are these people that are supposed to be in here?
[165:33.61]No.
[165:33.99]No guy.
[165:34.59]No gorillas reading books.
[165:42.57]Surrounded by gorillas.
[165:48.36]It was all a dream.
[165:52.86]Crying gorilla.
[165:55.88]Yeah, I don't know why the extra people are here for no reason.
[165:59.62]Wait, what?
[166:01.00]No, that's it.
[166:01.90]This is already such a fucking mess.
[166:03.98]It's over.
[166:09.48]Alright, you want the gorilla reading the book?
[166:13.11]You really badly want the gorilla reading the book?
[166:15.29]Is that what you guys want?
[166:17.65]Fine.
[166:21.07]Okay, it's a gorilla reading a book at the end.
[166:23.85]No, it's a gorilla taking a bath.
[166:30.80]Is this what you guys want?
[166:48.23]Is this what you want?
[166:50.37]This is what you want.
[166:53.86]Is this what you fucking want?
[166:56.28]You want a gorilla taking a bath?
[166:59.18]You want a fucking gorilla in a bathtub?
[167:01.86]With like two other gorillas in the fucking room?
[167:13.67]No, no, yes, yes.
[167:14.81]You want a bunch of gorillas?
[167:24.57]I need him reading the book.
[167:25.76]I'll do him reading the book.
[167:28.08]I wouldn't mind it actually.
[167:45.42]Fine.
[167:45.74]Here you go.
[167:48.98]Random extra.
[167:50.54]He's reading the book.
[167:51.47]He's going to turn the page.
[167:52.23]He's going to laugh like he always does.
[168:03.87]And he's like, hi.
[168:12.58]Why'd he close the book?
[168:25.31]You didn't think I was gonna fucking end it on this, did you?
[168:58.48]You didn't think I was gonna end this piece of shit movie on this?
[169:00.66]I'm way too high right now.
[169:54.63]Movies over.
[169:57.61]Movies over.
[169:58.29]It's it.
[170:03.11]Hit sound.
[170:04.35]Yeah, that happens every time you hit alt.
[170:09.99]This is a piece of fucking crap, by the way.
[170:12.05]This is like fucking awful.
[170:14.91]It's over.
[170:16.79]Movie time.
[170:19.49]This is a four star script.
[170:23.01]It got even better than the last one, apparently.
[170:24.59]Alright, I need a director.
[170:32.93]I'm gonna get a random shithead to be a director.
[170:34.71]Now we need... A bunch of sets.
[170:44.88]Urban rooftop.
[170:47.30]Shit, god, there's so many.
[170:48.60]Do I even have enough room for this shit?
[170:52.97]I know I need Starship Bridge.
[170:57.83]I already have Miniature City.
[170:58.89]I need... No, a bar?
[171:06.59]I don't even remember what's in this.
[171:08.73]Municipal Building.
[171:13.78]Rooftop.
[171:16.48]There's no places for these sets.
[171:18.94]Oh, God.
[171:19.40]I'm really out of room here.
[171:28.76]Subway station, right?
[171:30.36]Holy shit, I'm gonna have to delete things.
[171:32.22]Uh, I need... Subway carriage.
[171:45.79]Is that all I need?
[171:46.39]Wait, I need, like, the exterior, right?
[171:51.99]Shack exterior.
[171:54.97]Save the game?
[171:55.49]I will, don't worry.
[171:59.88]I can't fit anything anymore.
[172:01.63]There's no space.
[172:02.43]I need to, like, fucking move some of these up here.
[172:04.05]That was the least efficient way to put something.
[172:11.43]I need... How do I pick you up?
[172:17.28]How do you pick shit up?
[172:18.92]Uh, how come I can't pick this shit up?
[172:32.96]It's such a bad layout.
[172:33.90]I always put them in random spots.
[172:37.02]Does anybody know how you actually pick up buildings?
[172:38.60]I can't seem to do it.
[172:41.80]You need builders?
[172:43.40]No, I don't think I even made any because this is sandbox mode.
[172:45.34]Alright, builder.
[172:49.69]I need like one builder.
[172:53.45]Okay, there we go.
[173:00.11]Okay.

[173:45.59]Oh.

[173:54.84]Fuck.
[173:55.12]This is going to be huge, isn't it?
[173:56.62]Maybe we can make some room over here.
[174:16.39]Too many sets.
[174:17.59]We have so many of these dumb sets.
[174:26.78]Holy shit, we're getting Jupiters.
[174:28.60]Jupiters everywhere.
[174:31.86]Is that enough room for alien world?
[174:39.89]I think so.
[174:42.57]There we go.
[174:44.01]Need extras.
[174:44.97]You know where to go.

[177:23.55]No, it is still shooting.
[177:27.31]Wait, need a urban shabby hotel room.
[177:32.29]Why did it not tell me I needed that before?
[177:34.98]May I have your attention, please?
[177:37.14]It is time we pulled the plug on one of our current releases.
[177:40.81]Nobody's watching it anymore.
[177:42.93]Shabby hotel room.
[177:43.77]Look at its tiny.
[177:44.57]It'll fit up here, right?
[177:46.83]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[177:47.61]Come on.
[177:52.78]It's still shooting.
[177:56.10]So many sets.
[177:57.20]This is going to be such a piece of crap.
[177:58.62]This is not going to be close to being funny.
[178:04.79]Post-production.
[178:06.07]You guys know the drill.
[178:11.34]No, that's not it.
[178:14.60]Wait, what?
[178:16.92]I always fucking forget where the hell these things are.
[178:20.64]I wish I could zoom out further.
[178:23.37]Is any one of these buildings, like, right here?
[178:24.65]There it is.
[178:26.09]Post-production.
[178:33.25]I forgot about all these random scenes that are going to take ages.
[178:40.09]Voice acting, don't worry.
[178:41.87]I'm going to do that first.
[178:47.02]So it's right here.
[178:52.34]I didn't put these lizard people in here.
[178:59.28]This music needs to shut the fuck up.
[179:04.00]We need new music.
[179:04.82]We're gonna go with a big package.
[179:09.17]I like it.
[179:16.94]Okay.
[179:28.94]You're probably wondering how I got in this situation in the first place.
[179:32.52]Well, it turns out it's not that easy of a story.
[179:36.31]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happens.
[179:38.73]Get right out.
[179:40.27]That's me.
[179:41.59]Jake Delaney.
[179:43.63]22-year-old scientist.
[179:45.17]Fuck.
[179:49.46]That's not... I forget.
[179:54.66]It takes so...
[179:57.23]You're probably wondering how I got in this situation in the first place.
[180:00.84]Well, it turns out it's not that easy of a story.
[180:04.68]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happens.
[180:07.04]Get right out.
[180:08.58]That's me, Jake Delaney, 22-year-old scientist.
[180:13.22]Fuck.
[180:22.04]I don't even know what happens here.
[180:28.48]Jake Delauney.
[180:30.34]22-year-old scientist.
[180:32.66]With a means of... Fuck.
[180:35.19]That's not gonna work.
[180:36.77]Come on, give me the other dialog.
[180:42.95]Wait, what?
[180:43.79]Whoa, what the fuck?
[180:47.75]Get that out of here.
[180:56.69]Okay, here we go.
[181:00.83]So you're probably wondering how I got in this situation in the first place.
[181:04.51]Well, it turns out it's not that easy of a story.
[181:07.31]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happens, right now.
[181:12.24]That's me, Jake Delaney, 22-year-old scientist with a means for pressure and trouble.
[181:20.47]And this guy right here, I just heard myself say fuck.
[181:29.70]I can't even, like, trim the clip.
[181:33.26]Let's try it again.
[181:34.04]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happens.
[181:36.46]Get right out.
[181:38.01]That's me, Jake Delaney.
[181:41.21]22-year-old scientist.
[181:43.15]Just got out of college and got my degree.
[181:45.73]But how did I know that I was going to see all kinds of trouble?
[181:49.15]I just wanted to be a student, for crying out loud.
[181:53.38]Turns out, in 2022 AD, being a student's not allowed.
[181:57.89]And well, start from there, that's where it all began for me.
[182:01.25]I got arrested by the International Unit of Disrespectful... No, this is all fucked up.
[182:12.96]That easy of a story.
[182:15.08]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happened.
[182:17.47]Let's do it right now.
[182:19.01]That's me, Jake Delaney.
[182:22.06]No, this is all fucked up.
[182:50.73]Can I cut that part off?
[182:52.75]Can I cut that off?
[183:01.47]How do I, like, get rid of that?
[183:02.53]Alright, I gotta get the last piece of dialog here.
[183:09.37]...units of disrespectful... Now, this is a society of intergalactic space creatures.
[183:16.67]And what's a guy got to do in that situation?
[183:20.29]I got caught for doing all... Why is this in this?
[183:26.57]And why is there a lady here?
[183:30.33]Why the fuck is there a lady... Again, for me.
[183:32.61]I got arrested by the International Units of Disrespectful... No, this is all fucked up.
[183:38.66]Society of Intergalactic Space Creatures.
[183:41.62]And what's a guy got to do in that situation?
[183:46.42]I got caught for doing all...
[184:03.66]Okay.
[184:08.04]For doing all... And you don't get taken lightly when you do bad things in the intergalactic society.
[184:17.51]And that's where our story begins.
[184:19.99]So sit back and relax while we talk about it.
[184:24.70]This clip is really long.
[184:33.26]I think it just fucking stops here.
[184:34.76]You can't get caught doing bad things by the intergalactic union.
[184:45.87]so sit back and relax and enjoy my story it takes place over multiple time periods just in case you didn't know this is relative time even though the title already happened I got caught for doing all
[185:13.05]You can't get caught doing bad things by the Intergalactic Union.
[185:17.32]So, sit back and relax and enjoy my story.
[185:21.46]It takes place over multiple time periods.
[185:24.68]Just in case you didn't know.
[185:28.03]This is Relative Time.
[185:31.65]Even though the title already happened.
[185:48.08]His fucking face.
[185:50.06]Acid bass.
[186:00.05]Where's acid bass?
[186:22.08]So that happens and I have to come back with more narration.
[186:29.38]Why the fuck is there a gorilla here?
[186:33.48]Get rid of acid base.
[187:02.16]Is that the Splatooey Saloon?
[187:04.08]Alright, what even- what the fuck even happens here?
[187:19.14]That's Jake!
[187:19.78]My manager!
[187:21.78]He ended up getting in- I- this- I can't even do this.
[187:25.14]I can't even fucking do this shit.
[187:27.54]Hold on.
[187:29.82]This has to start over here.
[187:35.29]Yeah, I guess it turns out a duo is better than a solo one.
[187:40.23]That's my manager, Jake.
[187:42.19]Good thing we got him.
[187:43.33]Fucking God, what do I even do here?
[187:45.31]It's too fast.
[187:52.22]Yeah, I guess it turns out a duo is better than a solo one.
[187:57.16]That's my manager, Jake.
[187:59.14]Good thing we got him.
[188:00.26]Fucking God.
[188:06.85]I gotta make this much faster.
[188:13.36]This shit is so loud in my brain.
[188:20.22]You're probably wondering who that is.
[188:22.12]Well, that's my manager Jake.
[188:24.22]Turns out, a duo is better than a solo one.
[188:27.84]We took the town on and painted it red.
[188:30.80]And then I became a photographer.
[188:32.94]One of the best in the world.
[188:35.36]Me and Jake were good friends.
[188:38.84]Up until that very fateful day, which happened in the past.
[188:44.26]I don't know.
[188:50.54]You're probably wondering who that is.
[188:52.60]That's my manager, Jake.
[188:54.54]Turns out, a duo is better than a solo one.
[188:58.16]We took the town on and painted it red.
[189:01.11]And then I became a photographer.
[189:03.24]One of the best in the world.
[189:05.66]Me and Jake were good friends.
[189:09.12]Up until that very fateful day, which happened in the past.
[189:15.07]We were good friends is all I can say.
[189:17.23]That's all I can say.
[189:18.13]We were good friends.
[189:22.65]He's not even in the rest of the movie, by the way.
[189:28.20]I'm done with fucking doing voiceover, by the way.
[189:30.68]It's over right now.
[189:35.17]...day, which happened in the past, and Jake got taken by the aliens, and never returned.
[189:41.92]So it was my destiny to try to find him, where he was!
[189:45.24]That is so wrong.
[189:53.93]Which happened in the past, and Jake got taken by the aliens, and never returned.
[190:00.25]So it was my destiny to try to find him, where he was!
[190:23.97]I think I'm gonna delete all these, by the way.
[190:30.36]This is gone.
[190:34.52]That's it.
[190:34.96]Now the movie is gone.
[190:41.26]We need some more action.
[190:48.45]Armageddon.
[190:56.51]I don't know.
[191:05.31]I could go back to acid bass.
[191:07.33]Yeah, we're going back to acid bass.
[191:19.51]Right here.
[191:24.77]Past!
[191:29.43]Fucking god damn.
[191:31.96]I don't know.

[191:44.47]Change title style.
[191:46.11]Audio options.
[191:47.07]No.
[191:48.21]Looks like I should be able to, right?
[191:50.31]The little snipper.
[191:56.75]I don't know.
[192:04.78]Let's get some sounds in here.

[197:33.45]I fucking promised, but really, can you think of a better spot for that?
[197:37.26]I can't.
[197:52.11]What the fuck is this?

[197:55.15]What is this?
[198:11.92]Wait, what?

[198:28.09]What?
[198:32.47]What is this?
[198:32.99]What happens here?
[198:38.00]We need more music, different music.
[198:41.18]Oh yeah, this is supposed to be me fighting myself.
[198:54.29]Ah!
[199:06.86]This is not good.
[199:08.86]This music sucks.
[199:14.79]Well, I just, what is this one?
[199:39.98]Alright, well, let's stand.
[200:00.35]Boo.
[200:03.01]Boo.
[200:04.07]This is the part of the movie that sucks, so people boo it.
[200:07.87]Once it gets to be right here.
[200:08.81]This part of the movie just sucks.
[200:10.43]It just does.
[200:11.59]And then we get to be... What?
[200:21.56]I need a huge explosion here.
[200:33.76]It already does shoot, doesn't it?
[200:37.41]I need like an explosion sound because this is supposed to be a rocket launcher.
[201:00.14]Right there.
[201:09.22]This fucking dumb music is playing.
[201:13.61]There's a rocket fire sound?
[201:16.25]What the hell is that?
[201:21.61]Laser, laser, laser, bullet.
[201:25.59]Bullet, bullet, shotgun, cock, rocket.
[201:36.14]If they tell what's happening this goes through So long to shoot this fucking gun it takes so long to shoot the gun And now we need rocket hit What?
[202:12.87]That's not even the right captain.
[202:18.65]What the fuck is going on?
[202:30.80]What the fuck?
[202:40.54]What is this?
[202:41.16]What is this?
[202:41.70]Oh, this is back to... Whatever this is.
[202:54.03]Yeah, this is the climax.
[202:58.51]Okay.
[203:00.33]I think we've done it.
[203:09.55]Okay.
[203:15.54]That's it.
[203:20.59]The movie's ready.
[203:24.75]Do some voiceover for the ending?
[203:26.17]Alright, fine.
[203:36.49]I'll have one last piece of dialog.
[203:42.35]Oh, fuck!
[203:45.22]Why did it do that?
[203:50.42]Just got out of college and got my degree.
[203:53.17]God damn it.
[203:55.31]Because I tried to drag this stupid fucking thing.
[203:57.55]I didn't save it, so.
[204:01.95]No, don't save the changes.
[204:07.41]Dude's dialog won?
[204:21.20]No, I'm not gonna use dialog one.
[204:34.27]As you can see, turns out the hero does win sometimes in these stories.
[204:39.21]I'm living proof.
[204:41.62]Buy Coca-Cola, buy Dr. Pepper, and buy Sprite!
[204:47.84]What?
[204:51.15]As you can see, turns out the hero does win sometimes in these stories.
[204:56.09]I'm living proof.
[204:58.50]Buy Coca-Cola, buy Dr. Pepper, and buy Sprite!
[205:13.33]That's the point of the movie, guys.
[205:15.23]Come on.

[205:28.86]Where is it?
[205:29.18]What's it called?

[205:38.20]Happy stride.
[206:11.59]This movie sucks.
[206:16.22]This movie sucks.

[207:31.09]Three, two, one.
[207:32.69]Action.
[207:43.90]Hello, Moto.
[208:27.67]You're probably wondering how I got in this situation in the first place.
[208:31.27]Well, it turns out it's not that easy of a story.
[208:35.11]Let's go ahead and start at the beginning, where it all happens, right now.
[208:39.02]That's me, Jake Delaney.
[208:42.08]22-year-old scientist, just got out of college and got my degree.
[208:46.40]But how did I know that I was going to see all kinds of trouble?
[208:49.83]I just wanted to be a student, for crying out loud.
[208:53.07]Turns out, in 2022 AD, being a student's not allowed.
[208:58.57]And well, start from there, that's where it all began for me.
[209:02.82]I got arrested by the International Units of Disrespectful Society of Intergalactic Space Creatures.
[209:11.12]And what's a guy to do in that situation?
[209:14.74]I got caught for doing all... And you can't get caught doing bad things by the Intergalactic Union.
[209:24.19]So, sit back and relax.
[209:27.03]And enjoy my story.
[209:28.69]It takes place over multiple time periods.
[209:31.53]Just in case you didn't know.
[209:34.89]This is Relative Time.
[209:38.50]Even though the title already happened.
[209:54.51]Ooh!
[210:24.50]You're probably wondering who that is.
[210:26.54]That's my manager Jake.
[210:28.48]Turns out, a duo is better than a solo one.
[210:32.13]We took the town on and painted it red.
[210:35.07]And then I became a photographer.
[210:37.21]One of the best in the world.
[210:39.61]Me and Jake were good friends.
[210:43.11]Up until that very fateful day, which happened in the past.
[210:48.54]I don't know.
[211:02.73]It's fucking too long.
[211:03.89]Ow.
[211:04.93]This is fucking crazy.
[211:07.31]Wee-hee.
[212:08.67]What is this?
[212:15.08]It's huge!
[212:33.80]Boo!
[212:37.32]Boo!
[212:37.54]Boo!
[212:39.04]Boo!
[212:40.72]Boo!
[212:41.56]Boo!
[212:41.94]Boo!
[212:42.94]Boo!
[212:45.38]Boo!
[213:02.42]Yay!
[213:03.26]Woohoo!
[213:05.04]Woohoo!
[213:07.02]Woohoo!
[213:07.82]Woohoo!
[213:13.23]Woohoo!
[213:43.58]As you can see, turns out the hero does win sometimes in these stories.
[214:08.96]I'm living proof.
[214:12.66]Buy Coca-Cola, buy Dr. Pepper, and buy Sprite!
[214:18.90]What?
[214:20.78]What is the noise?
[214:22.94]What is this noise?
[214:27.48]Why is there a crane in the background?
[214:36.28]Why is there a car in the background?
[214:43.04]Why is there a fucking car going the whole time?
[214:45.74]It was a loud engine the whole fucking second half of the movie.
[214:51.26]Ugh.
[214:53.14]Why?
[214:55.10]Would there be a car just driving?
[214:57.29]Ugh.
[215:00.67]The fucking fart coming out of the... It'll never not be funny.
[215:03.99]I'm so glad I put it in.
[215:06.51]I love this game so much.
[215:08.81]This is like the best game ever made.
[215:10.24]Ugh.
[215:15.60]If you guys want to know, this has crawled its way into one of my favorite games of all time, I think.
[215:21.98]It's just so fucking ridiculous.
[215:23.80]You can just make the most incoherent fucking mess.
[215:27.62]Ugh.
[215:30.38]Alright.
[215:32.40]How much money does it make?
[215:37.02]I don't think it says it yet.
[215:43.80]Seven months, 284,000.
[215:44.36]The crew, what a bunch of incompetent, inexperienced cretins.
[215:57.15]You have to squint to find a star name in this flick.
[216:02.91]The best sci-fi plot I've seen in a very long time by Look Films.
[216:07.70]Yeah.
[216:09.56]Ugh.
[216:11.64]A solid start in the sci-fi genre for Sandstorm Studios.
[216:14.91]Oh yeah, I called myself Sandstorm Studio.
[216:19.83]That was fucking fun.
[216:24.10]Oy yi yi.
[216:24.82]Alright.
[216:27.40]How much money did this one make?
[216:30.92]$660,000 for Renegade Realtor.
[216:33.73]And we'll see how much this one makes.
[216:38.29]Ugh.
[216:39.31]I love how half that movie just shouldn't have even been in there.
[216:43.48]If I took out, like, the knife fight and, like, the alien doctor outgrip bullshit, like, it would have been, like, actually a kind of competent movie.
[216:52.30]Yeah, it's sad that this is nowhere to be found, only on Amazon.
[216:57.66]I wish they would release this on Steam so more people could enjoy this fucking masterpiece of a video game.
[217:03.70]Oh, boy.
[217:07.52]Oh, my God.
[217:08.02]Anyways, I think that's going to be it for me tonight.
[217:11.55]I'm not sure I can, like, put the effort into another one.
[217:13.65]I'm, like, sick still.
[217:14.63]A little sick, kind of, still.
[217:17.27]I'm, like, just barely getting to that point where I'm going to be sick tomorrow.
[217:19.85]I know it.
[217:21.73]And that, like, just made it much worse.
[217:27.11]But thanks, everybody, for sticking around.
[217:30.57]I hope you enjoyed the two extremely high-quality features we made tonight.
[217:39.20]You'll go buy Coke products.
[217:42.52]But before I go, I do want to say a special thanks to... Let's talk about bits first.
[217:47.43]Renegade Coaster, 2,000 bits, 20 bucks.
[217:49.61]Thanks a lot.
[217:50.89]Please put this on the main channel with no explanation.
[217:53.29]I was thinking about just putting at least one or two of them on there, but people would be so... It would be like a slap in the face to my whole audience.
[218:02.57]Oh, yeah, and there's gonna be all kinds of great content on that channel.
[218:06.11]People are, like, waiting for a new video, and they get that.
[218:08.79]I feel like that would, like, make me mad.
[218:12.73]We'll see, though.
[218:15.11]But thank you, uh, Croacher, Jörg.
[218:16.89]Thanks, Croacher, for the five bucks.

[218:46.59]Well, I'm glad like this was a fun stream because there was a lot of set pieces that we didn't get to use last time, last week or two weeks ago, whatever.
[218:54.88]And I wanted to make sure we could at least get some of like the more like in the year 2000 type stuff you can do in this game.
[219:03.63]But thanks for the bits, dude.
[219:04.75]Thank you, uh, Wumple Doodle for the bits.

[219:21.54]Toddy Knows for 500 bits.
[219:23.86]Why does a scientist student have a manager who is one of the world's best photographers?
[219:28.87]I don't know.
[219:29.29]I just fucking said words.
[219:31.62]Ching, Ching, Ching!
[219:32.36]Ching, Ching, Ching, Ching, Ching, Ching, Ching, Ching!

[220:04.91]It was a little weird.
[220:11.01]That's it for the bits.
[220:12.12]Thanks a lot, guys.
[220:12.78]If you gave 100 or whatever, they never expected, but they can appreciate it for sure.

[220:20.94]Thanks a lot, dude.
[220:24.13]Alright, and for subs, before I go, let's see if I can turn this down.
[220:30.97]Out of all the Jerma 985s, you're my favorite one.
[220:36.42]Thanks, dude.
[220:38.12]Alright, Euclid, thanks for the sub, manned 4241 for three months.
[220:42.50]I felt like 45 minutes ago.
[220:44.36]I left like 45 minutes ago, and we're still on this movie.
[220:47.95]Well, I think it was worth it.
[220:50.23]Thanks for the sub.
[220:53.55]Thanks for the four months.
[220:55.98]Thanks a lot, guys.
[221:07.25]And with that, I'm going to say farewell to you guys.
[221:10.07]Thanks for sticking around.
[221:14.15]Have a good one.
[221:15.17]Have a good night.
[221:17.44]I hope you enjoyed the stream there.
[221:19.80]I just wanted to make sure I said hello to the people I missed over the last hour or so.
[221:26.04]Hey, have some more.
[221:26.80]Thanks a lot, dude.
[221:28.74]So, good night.
[221:30.12]Take care, everybody.
[221:30.76]I will save the game before I go.
[221:33.12]Make sure I do that if we play it again.
[221:36.08]Which, you know, I'm never ruling it out because obviously it's fun to make these videos and stuff.
[221:40.04]$666,000 and still going.
[221:45.32]But I will see you guys on Thursday.
[221:48.84]I might play Dead Rising 4 on Thursday.
[221:54.38]So you can probably expect that.
[221:56.17]If for some reason I don't feel like playing Dead Rising, we'll just do something else.
[221:59.85]But much love.
[222:01.09]Thanks a lot, guys.
[222:02.55]Have a good rest of your evening or afternoon, wherever you happen to be.
[222:06.95]Or early morning for some of you.
[222:09.83]Good night.
[222:10.31]Goodbye.
[222:11.67]Ta-ta.
