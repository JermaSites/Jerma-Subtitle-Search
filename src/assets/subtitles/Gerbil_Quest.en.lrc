[00:04.54]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:05.60]Jerma here, lost another bet.
[00:07.56]Yeah, Jerma loses bets every single one he makes.
[00:11.41]I bet MLC Stealth that corn grows from trees, like it hangs from trees like an orange, and I have to play this game because I lost.
[00:18.97]So what happened was, uh, corns don't grow from trees.
[00:22.15]In fact, my phone's ringing right now.
[00:23.43]Hold on, it's my dad.
[00:24.23]Let me answer it.
[00:25.93]Alright, so, take it easy everybody, we'll see you in... Hello?
[00:31.55]Hello?
[00:34.37]Just a regular little gerbil.
[00:36.67]Oh, so cute.
[00:37.41]I look like I've got a cute nose and I'm sniffing.
[00:40.29]What's that?
[00:41.01]What's that?
[00:41.25]You didn't think I was fucking Yoda?
[00:42.45]You didn't think I had a lightsaber like the Star Wars movies?
[00:44.54]What are you, fucking crazy?
[00:46.90]Oh, shit.
[00:48.12]Look out.
[00:49.46]It's the George Foreman grills.
[00:53.10]We gotta take them out.
[00:54.22]That's the plot of this movie.
[00:56.22]The George Foreman grills got brains and they came after the hamster clans.
[00:59.70]Press the button to deploy Mooch.
[01:01.95]Go, Mooch.
[01:04.33]Is this humans walking around in this game?
[01:08.55]Can I- can I shoot this guy?
[01:16.18]What is this?
[01:17.78]Let me shoot this guy, like, right in the face.
[01:19.94]He's shooting!
[01:20.68]What is this laser beam he's shooting at me?
[01:24.18]Please tell me I can, like, kill this guy.
[01:25.72]Come on, I'm gonna climb up on you.
[01:27.78]Oh, shit.
[01:36.82]No!
[01:39.56]This is so stupid!
[01:42.82]So, okay, I guess I can't hurt these guys.
[01:44.67]Oh shit, spider vacuum!
[01:53.53]Oh no, a spider vacuum!
[01:56.15]I will kill you!
[01:58.38]Hey!
[02:00.92]Hey!
[02:03.41]Put me down!
[02:04.03]What the hell is this?
[02:06.47]Where's he taking me?
[02:09.85]I just don't want to play this game anymore.
[02:11.77]I just don't want to- I don't want to do this anymore.
[02:13.31]Boo, there has to be some way you can get me out of this bed.
[02:16.10]Please, in the rule book or something.
[02:17.96]Let me see here.
[02:19.30]Please.
[02:21.87]According to section 54t paragraph 3 of the Agricultural Video Gamers Handbook, when one party accepts any type of corn agreement pertaining to and not exceeding corn, corn syrup, corn on the cob, corn flakes, or corn meal, neither party shall dismiss any form of the required conclusion unless brought before the Cincinnati Maze and Syrup Commission.
[02:46.59]No, no, no, rip it up.
[02:47.72]Rip that fucking book up!
[02:49.20]Rip that book up and throw it in the trash!
[02:50.74]Make the rules, Gemma.
[02:51.64]These are the rules.
[02:52.08]You do make the rules!
[02:54.48]What's coming down here?
[02:55.62]Is there... Uh-oh!
[02:58.86]It's a razor!
[03:04.07]Oh, you went through the... You went through it!
[03:05.89]That's what's happening!
[03:06.45]You went through the hole!
[03:09.17]Get out of my face!
[03:10.75]Go away!
[03:11.45]I don't want to deal with you!
[03:13.65]Fly!
[03:15.23]Fly!
[03:17.52]Darling, make sure you jump on the controls and pull it down.
[03:22.81]Good work, darling.
[03:25.13]Watch, he's gonna- ready?
[03:26.09]He's gonna start talking in a second here.
[03:28.05]All this dumb shit I've been saying in the last couple minutes, you'll hear it.
[03:32.15]Any second now.
[03:34.03]Watch, ready?
[03:34.87]When I jump on this... Here he comes.
[03:37.78]He's gonna start talking.
[03:41.40]What the hell is that?
[03:44.50]The giant coffee maker?
[03:47.76]Oh, you want to fuck with the ice coffee machine?
[03:49.74]How do I... wait, I need to scan it.
[03:52.45]Let's find out its weaknesses.
[03:54.79]Vulnerable to most weapons, this lumbering behemoth forms its own shield for protection, but will redirect the shield energy into a power attack.
[04:03.77]Alright, so just attack him.
[04:06.24]I can destroy this thing, right?
[04:07.40]Yeah, I can.
[04:08.74]I don't know if that's doing much.
[04:10.84]Nah, it's gone.
[04:12.06]You... Oh, boy.
[04:14.22]Almost dead.
[04:15.70]Almost dead.
[04:17.04]Do not... That almost killed me.
[04:21.87]Drop your shield!
[04:25.41]Die!
[04:27.23]You're dead.
[04:27.77]No, you're not.
[04:28.73]No, you're not.
[04:30.33]I am just being missed right here, guys.
[04:31.95]This is the most intense battle of the game so far.
[04:34.89]Gerbil versus coffee machine.
[04:37.55]You can't write this shit!
[04:38.93]You can't make a movie!
[04:39.81]Oh, this is a movie.
[04:40.95]Forgot.
[04:44.74]No!
[04:46.24]No!
[04:47.80]No!
[04:49.14]Come on!
[04:52.18]God, you fuck!
[04:59.05]Oh, he's... You've got to be kidding me.
[05:01.37]No, no, no!
[05:05.29]Darling, I'm hacking into the database.
[05:08.06]Here he comes, here he comes.
[05:11.78]Listen.
[05:13.10]I can see a vent leading from one of the storage rooms.
[05:16.48]Use Mooch for a quick recon and locate the exit.
[05:20.11]Mooch, my man, standing by your... Here he flies.
[05:25.41]Whoops.
[05:45.21]I'm going to take an early lunch.
[05:47.21]The conveyor belts aren't going to go backwards.
[05:50.17]A gerbil ain't going to just jump on the keyboard and press the button to make... We're not going to lose $200 million an hour.
[05:56.28]I mean, come on.
[05:57.38]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[05:59.08]Bill, you're fired.
[06:01.40]I really don't want to be the person to tell you this, but Bill, you are fired, dude.
[06:05.03]Look what you've done.
[06:06.41]Don't even show up tomorrow.
[06:08.63]All right.
[06:09.75]Let's make it count, huh?
[06:12.01]Let's do it.
[06:14.40]Don't run out of juice.
[06:17.48]Perfect.
[06:18.89]Now I gotta get the core.
[06:20.95]Core received.
[06:25.19]What?
[06:32.39]The power core is gone, because I fell- Where the fuck is the power core?
[06:38.94]What, because I fell off the edge?
[06:40.62]I thought it was like a cutscene.
[06:41.70]I didn't think I could actually die.
[06:43.95]And now I broke the game.
[06:46.27]So there was a core here.
[06:48.10]I took it and I fell off.
[06:49.00]And now I can't do anything now.
[06:52.66]Is it, can I hover, like, right here?
[06:54.80]Maybe it, like, fell down, can I grab it from, like, this crack?
[06:58.01]No, I can't.
[06:59.69]And that's it.
[07:00.65]I'm done.
[07:01.03]That's gonna be the end.
[07:01.87]Alright, we'll see you later.
[07:03.17]This has been Gerbil Quest.
[07:05.01]And I'm gonna give this game a four Burger Boy Snot Booger Pukes out of seven potential Burger Boy Snot Booger Bugle Boy Pukes out of eight.
