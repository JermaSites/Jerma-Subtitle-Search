[ve:61.1.100]

[01:05.28]Good evening.
[01:06.30]How are you?
[01:12.29]What are you doing?
[01:13.05]Alright.
[01:18.03]Cool.
[01:24.93]Today, we've got something very special.
[01:31.35]Or maybe it is.
[01:34.36]gonna be playing the wheel of time the video game I did not know that this was based on a 14 book series I thought it was just a one or two books in a TV show but there's a game that came out like 25 years ago and I was like you know maybe I'll stream for a few hours
[01:58.47]Let's see if these ads kick in so we can get rid of the pre-rolls.
[02:01.77]Let's see if it happens.
[02:02.87]Is it going to turn on?
[02:03.85]Are you going to cut me off?
[02:07.79]I know.
[02:08.37]You're going to watch WrestleMania?
[02:13.29]I don't even know what's going on in WrestleMania.
[02:17.86]What's going on in WWE right now?
[02:19.42]I don't know any characters.
[02:22.32]I don't know any wrestlers.
[02:27.51]They wrestle.
[02:29.29]Yeah, but I don't know.
[02:30.93]OK, every time I hear about wrestling, it's.
[02:34.47]The Undertaker is back.
[02:37.79]And The Rock is back.
[02:40.35]I just keep hearing about that somebody's back for like an evening.
[02:49.24]John Cena is back.
[02:50.76]Yeah.
[02:56.90]That's coming to my feed.
[03:02.22]Yeah, if this game sucks and if I hate it, then there is a backup.
[03:06.40]There is a backup.
[03:07.04]It's called Voodoo Kid.
[03:09.90]Looked very wild.
[03:10.84]We're going to play it eventually, but we'll see.
[03:14.16]Just want to hang out a little pre-Easter stream.
[03:18.86]I will not be live tomorrow.
[03:28.43]It's Easter today.
[03:30.37]Well, it probably is Easter for some of you.
[03:36.11]Easter and 420.
[03:36.83]You're going to stream from church.
[03:42.67]No, I'm not going to stream from church.
[03:44.53]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[03:53.22]Why not?
[03:53.96]I'm just not streaming tomorrow.
[04:04.53]The game is decent.
[04:05.27]The controls are straightforward on keyboard, but you may have issues with the controller.
[04:09.53]Yeah, I'm going to do keyboard mouse.
[04:20.33]I was looking forward to Bush Sunday.
[04:23.40]Well, no, we're doing.
[04:24.40]We're going to we're going to do.
[04:27.90]We're going to play itch.io stuff on the next weekend.
[04:32.00]I'm not going to call it that.
[04:34.78]I refuse to call it that, because when you start calling something something, it sticks, and then everybody just starts to call it that.
[04:51.27]And you can't say Bush Sunday, what if it's on a Saturday?
[04:55.81]Or if it's on Friday, I don't know.
[05:00.07]I do still want to get that Monster Rancher little tournament thing off the ground.
[05:06.54]And we've got the House Flipper Invitational coming up too.
[05:08.88]In like a month.
[05:09.42]A little bit more than... But yeah, just about a month.
[05:12.99]There's a lot going on.
[05:13.71]A whole bush month.
[05:29.63]You of all people aren't watching Wrestlemania?
[05:31.78]I... Alright, listen.
[05:34.14]I have not seen...
[05:36.97]I've not watched wrestling in probably 15 plus years, at least.
[05:43.77]Fake fan?
[05:44.47]No, it's called not a... No, don't call me a fake fan.
[05:47.81]I'm not a fan.
[05:49.58]Wait, no, I don't claim to be a fan.
[05:51.02]Alright, I think ads are running.
[06:00.57]Alright, be back in three minutes.
[06:02.13]We'll get started.
[06:02.77]Yeah, but I'm not a... I never said I was a current wrestling fan.
[06:12.30]I'm a fan back when the Ultimate Warrior used to sprint out and run as fast as he could and grab the ropes.
[06:22.33]I liked when Stoned Cold used to... They used to drink a beer and then stun people.
[06:38.47]You always pretend to like things and get called out for it.
[06:44.37]Okay, if I had been telling you guys over the last five years, oh, did you see the Royal Rumble last night?
[06:50.76]It was crazy.
[06:51.76]Dude, can you see?
[06:52.90]Remember when he jumped off the top rope and he went on the outside?
[06:56.08]If I was just making that up, then yeah, I haven't brought up wrestling to you guys in like probably 10 years.
[06:59.84]I said eight ads.
[07:04.62]Hell nah.
[07:06.86]That is a first time chatter, by the way.
[07:08.74]Ah, shit.
[07:10.08]That's a first time chatter.
[07:11.58]Ah, fuck.
[07:20.58]Are we gonna lose him?
[07:22.47]Ah, it's alright.
[07:24.49]Sorry.
[07:27.17]Hell no.
[07:29.67]That's a potential lost customer?
[07:36.26]What do you mean, customer?
[07:38.86]Wait, who's the customer here?
[07:53.29]Please explain the title.
[07:54.43]I feel the same way when you do those damn sponsored streams.
[08:02.46]Here's the thing, the sponsored streams...
[08:05.80]Sometimes it's just like, alright, whatever, I'm gonna do it.
[08:12.87]If it makes sense to me, I'm gonna do it.
[08:24.01]Put the ads to full blast.
[08:25.57]No way.
[08:27.49]It pays for all the bush lights and lava lamps.
[08:44.25]Lava lamps are cool?
[08:45.29]Oh, yeah.
[08:47.21]You need to buy a new LARPing sword.
[08:50.25]You show two swords that you got.
[08:55.41]You show two swords and everybody just thinks that you're a weirdo now.
[09:03.32]You've never been to a renaissance fair and been like, ooh, whoa, oh!
[09:07.38]Honey, look at that!
[09:09.04]Honey, that's a dagger!
[09:10.50]Wow!
[09:11.12]Can I see that?
[09:12.08]Can I hold that for a second?
[09:14.49]What do you think about this?
[09:16.90]Oh, look at the emblem on that, sweetheart.
[09:22.00]No, I'm not a dork.
[09:23.26]Well, okay.
[09:24.86]I don't know what you're doing here.
[09:25.74]Alright, let's do it.
[09:29.82]This is Wheel of Time.
[09:31.49]Welcome back, everybody.
[09:33.39]You didn't miss anything.
[09:34.27]We weren't talking about anything.
[09:39.93]There is an opening cutscene that I don't want to miss, so let's go ahead and bring it up over here.
[09:45.14]Uh-huh.
[09:47.18]Uh-huh.
[09:47.52]Alright, here we go.
[09:51.18]The Wheel of Time.
[09:55.49]You guys ready?
[09:59.07]I'm excited.
[10:09.70]Did anybody read these books?
[10:13.40]Oh, shit.
[10:13.68]It's the Elden Ring.
[10:17.03]Actually is.
[10:19.13]Oh wait, this is just the company that is the company that made it.
[10:28.56]Oh, that's not the wait.
[10:29.94]OK, replay intro.
[10:32.46]Let's replay the intro.
[10:33.54]Was that the intro?
[10:40.57]No, this is the intro.
[10:41.47]The wheel of time turns and ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.
[10:49.38]Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again.
[10:59.36]In one such age long past, the age of legends, mankind enjoyed a time of prosperity.
[11:07.73]Certain people, called Aes Sedai, were born with the ability to sense and channel the One Power.
[11:14.93]This was the energy at the center of the universe, the driving force of creation.
[11:20.50]Drawing on the One Power, the Aes Sedai could accomplish anything.
[11:25.60]Okay, cool.
[11:26.26]Why?
[11:26.34]Wait, Shaitan?
[11:53.74]Ooh, look out, it's Shaitan.
[11:57.47]The Dark One.
[11:59.99]Many flocked to the Dark One's banner, including 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai, known later as the Forsaken.
[12:09.17]It was only the 14th clan of the 14th book.
[12:12.55]Created by the Dark One out of nightmare.
[12:15.99]Trollocs and their horrific masters, the Myrdal.
[12:21.02]The war of the shadow had begun.
[12:23.40]Okay.
[12:24.82]So who are we?
[12:25.22]A man called the Dragon led an assault against Shale Gul, the location of the boar.
[12:31.69]Are we getting like all the books condensed into like one intro?
[12:36.09]He closed it off, trapping the Dark One and the Thirteen Forsaken on the other side.
[12:44.01]The dragon created a collection of palm-sized stone seals to contain the power that kept the prison closed.
[12:52.53]These seals the dragon entrusted to the remaining Aes Sedai.
[12:57.33]For years, the Aes Sedai kept the seals safe in the White Tower.
[13:03.35]But the Dark One had his revenge.
[13:06.60]Moments before his banishment, in a final blow against the dragon, he tainted the male aspect of the One Power.
[13:15.24]The taint drove every man who could channel insane and uncontrolled.
[13:21.46]These madmen rent the very Earth with their power.
[13:25.77]This time became known as the Breaking of the World.
[13:31.27]The women of the Aes Sedai rallied and eventually destroyed the male channelers.
[13:37.61]But many of the seals were lost in the chaos.
[13:41.04]Only two remained within the White Tower.
[13:44.10]To this day, the Aes Sedai search for the missing seals, but unknown to them, others search as well.
[13:54.58]What was, what will be, and what is may yet fall under the shadow.
[14:04.14]The Wheel of Time.
[14:05.82]Book one, chapter one of 460.
[14:09.02]Okay, single player.
[14:13.76]Uh, tutorial.
[14:17.49]Should we do the tutorial?
[14:19.39]End of the testing.
[14:21.51]Yeah, okay, we need to get introduced to the Wheel of Time.
[14:26.33]Elena, in order to be initiated into the White Tower, you must be tested.
[14:31.35]The artifact you see here is a special Tirangreal for this purpose.
[14:35.65]Huh.
[14:36.19]Walk through each of its arches in turn.
[14:38.80]They will bring you face to face with your greatest fears.
[14:42.44]Don't panic, but listen for my voice.
[14:45.56]I will guide you through.
[14:47.24]In this way, we start your training.
[14:49.36]So I gotta walk through the arches?
[14:50.75]This time is for what was.
[14:53.23]The way back will come but once.
[14:55.95]Be steadfast.
[14:58.47]Okay, so walk through the arch.
[15:02.25]This one?
[15:02.58]Well, I'm scared.
[15:03.78]What if it hurts me?
[15:09.21]Making me relive my horrible moments?
[15:10.71]What do I have to face?
[15:37.42]Wait, you're putting too much shit on the screen.
[15:45.13]Press move forward to run ahead.
[15:47.31]Up arrow.
[15:47.83]That's not it.
[15:48.77]Back.
[15:50.03]What?
[15:56.44]F5.
[15:57.48]F6.
[15:59.32]Oh, I just saved it.
[16:00.88]Jump.
[16:01.48]Press jump to jump straight up.
[16:03.42]Press jump.
[16:04.18]Will you let me listen to it for one more second?
[16:12.53]The exit is in sight, Elena.
[16:14.60]But out of reach.
[16:15.86]There must be another way to the arch.
[16:18.60]Steal yourself and drop your hurt, child.
[16:21.60]Take some of the roots that grow in this cave.
[16:23.86]They have healing properties.
[16:27.69]Can I go in here?
[16:28.33]A child, please come up from under the water.
[16:35.55]You're not supposed to be down there.
[16:37.94]I pressed space to not drown.
[16:40.76]Child.
[16:47.06]Child, please press W. The path is broken, so you'll have to leap over the holes.
[16:55.44]Be wary of the waves.
[16:58.23]Okay, is she like shaking me in real life to get this effect?
[17:03.39]Where am I?
[17:03.87]Is she shaking my shoulders to have this happen to me?
[17:07.96]Is this like being in VR?
[17:09.52]Oh, I gotta make this jump.
[17:12.58]Duuude.
[17:20.41]Got it.
[17:21.31]Nice.
[17:21.63]Okay.
[17:21.73]The way back will come but once.
[17:24.35]Walk through the arch.
[17:28.80]Did it.
[17:29.32]Easy.
[17:29.68]You've done well, Elena.
[17:31.12]But you've only begun.
[17:31.98]The second time is for what is.
[17:36.26]The way back will come but once.
[17:38.86]Be steadfast.
[17:40.28]Okay, so this is... Elena, your virtually non-existent ability to channel is crippling.
[17:48.56]Damn.
[17:49.34]Fear of failure has driven you to use Tirangreal as crutches.
[17:53.21]Yet you still hide from the world, doing research in the White Tower.
[17:58.19]Only the lure of new artifacts could draw you from the safety of the tower.
[18:03.27]These are the basements of a powerful dark friend who also collects Tirangreal, a collection protected by traps.
[18:10.88]Okay.
[18:11.38]Try the door, Elena.
[18:12.86]Although the lock doesn't bode well.
[18:15.12]Oh, no.
[18:18.39]So much for that.
[18:19.87]You must explore this storeroom for another exit or find the key to this one.
[18:25.05]Oh.
[18:25.19]Is it over there?
[18:31.41]What could be in the book of spells?
[18:34.11]Your experience allows you to identify the functions of new artifacts.
[18:38.11]What did I just get?
[18:38.83]When you pick up a Tirangrial, examine it to understand what you need.
[18:41.59]Stop going so fast!
[18:43.21]Researching your Tirangrial is very important.
[18:45.51]You should do so when you pick up a new artifact.
[18:47.47]Select Air Pulse by pressing 1, and then re- What was it?
[18:51.09]Research?
[18:52.67]Others open- How do I research this?
[18:54.87]What was it?
[18:57.09]F2.
[18:57.37]Open these crates, Elena.
[19:01.04]Here's the worst part about this teaching method.
[19:04.50]She is speaking to me directions and making me read directions at the same time.
[19:11.90]So, you've kind of, you've run it into a traffic jam here.
[19:16.02]By the way, I've got a quick story for you.
[19:19.47]I was in the grocery store again, and was walking around with the cart, and, true story by the way, and moving around, it was very busy, this is kind of, it was probably like three or four o'clock, so it's kind of a lot of people at the grocery store, and I noticed that three, I was on one of the outer aisles, so I was not in one of the aisles, and I'm going down, and I see, in my peripheral, two or three aisles up.
[19:43.62]some guys coming out of one of the aisles, and some lady was coming the other way, and they almost ran into each other.
[19:50.09]And what the fuck did that guy say?
[19:52.87]What did that guy say?
[19:53.99]What do you think that guy said?
[19:59.85]Oh, whoops, oh, sorry about that.
[20:02.21]Traffic.
[20:04.48]I swear.
[20:08.20]I swear to God.
[20:12.76]You are worsening people?
[20:17.41]No, I'm telling you.
[20:19.09]Look, is it possible that that's what I wanted to hear, so that's what I heard?
[20:23.69]Sure.
[20:24.80]But it was pretty clear.
[20:26.70]It was pretty clear.
[20:30.84]Was he 70?
[20:31.70]No.
[20:32.10]Probably in his mid-40s.
[20:38.78]That's default white man NPC dialog.
[20:41.48]That's fine.
[20:42.08]That's fine.
[20:42.96]I'm just telling you that that happened.
[20:45.49]Are you sure?
[20:47.09]Somebody said, was there a mirror?
[20:49.25]Like, I say it, and I think, no, how many mirrors would be in a grocery store?
[20:54.16]You're a weirdo.
[20:55.16]Well, no, I'm not.
[20:55.92]I just, I heard it.
[20:57.18]I was literally an island, I was two aisles down.
[21:01.92]Okay.
[21:02.74]Air Pulse pushes a small, quick weave of air directly in front of you at a very close range.
[21:08.59]If the blast of air strikes someone, the weave hits like a hammer, inflicting monstrous, destructive damage.
[21:17.55]Okay, replenishes power from the one source, so charges are not expended.
[21:21.22]Okay.
[21:21.40]So how do I use it?
[21:27.02]Oh, that's a gigantic menu.
[21:32.23]Somebody screenshot this?
[21:41.21]Cool.
[21:41.55]I have an infinite amount of these?
[21:46.66]Oh, dude.
[21:46.98]Alright.
[21:47.22]You stand all the way.
[21:47.82]Okay.
[21:48.06]I'm going to stand here.
[21:49.12]You stand right here.
[21:51.18]Okay.
[21:52.26]Now I'm going to use the little air cannon thing and I'm going to pull the thing back and go boom.
[21:55.04]Did it hit you in the face?
[21:57.40]Dude, it got me right in the face.
[21:59.42]Alright.
[21:59.64]No, no, no, no.
[22:00.22]Step back like 10 more feet.
[22:02.12]Right here.
[22:03.64]Okay.
[22:03.86]Now I'm going to stand here.
[22:04.81]Alright.
[22:06.27]I'm going to angle this down, like pretty down because it goes way up.
[22:09.49]Alright.
[22:09.71]Ready?
[22:09.85]Tell me if you feel it.
[22:14.97]Oh, dude.
[22:15.67]Oh, dude.
[22:16.49]I saw your hair go back.
[22:19.27]Yeah, I played with one of those.
[22:26.95]yeah alright so now I'm gonna use the air zooka to get rid of the lock okay I guess we're not doing that some crates hold items in this case what is this
[22:52.50]Okay, this is fire.
[22:53.44]After activating the Terrigal, it leaves a simple sphere of light.
[22:56.70]The sphere accompanies you until unraveled by a subsequent activation.
[23:02.93]Light sphere.
[23:03.61]Uh, cool.
[23:08.83]I'm dead.
[23:09.55]I'm just going to die here.
[23:11.67]I'm dead here.
[23:12.83]No, I think I'm dead.
[23:14.01]Air can't go through metal like this.
[23:14.97]I'm dead.
[23:33.17]Right now she is freaking out, banning through text, going, oh, shit.
[23:37.25]Oh, it seems you can't break it with air pulse.
[23:40.41]I should have taught you Hulk bar bend.
[23:43.05]Oh, my God, it worked.
[24:03.92]Let's go.
[24:04.16]Okay.
[24:04.26]Okay, just one charge.
[24:04.82]What does this one do?
[24:05.68]This is called Shift.
[24:06.48]Shift instantly moves you a few paces ahead of your current location.
[24:30.37]Oh, cool.
[24:31.09]This game is cool.
[24:31.96]Is it other books like this?
[24:34.06]This seems like kind of cool.
[24:35.22]Is it just like this?
[24:52.67]This trap is the deadliest one.
[24:54.73]A stream of fireballs prevents anyone from going further.
[24:58.13]However, the fire shield artifact here protects against both weaves of fire and fire-based environmental hazards.
[25:05.11]Take and use it.
[25:06.35]Then walk down this hall.
[25:17.50]Oh my god!
[25:18.28]What I got?
[25:20.78]What I got?
[25:21.28]The drink?
[25:21.82]The chalice?
[25:22.36]Ooh, this one's a heal.
[25:23.84]With each act, the heal... tatsies your health slightly?
[25:26.72]Oh, raises!
[25:48.16]Cool, it's 10 health.
[25:48.96]Alright, reflect.
[25:55.74]Okay, with one, three, okay, four is reflect.
[26:00.69]For a short time, reflect surrounds you with a shield that causes any weave that strikes it to bounce back at the originator.
[26:08.93]Ready?
[26:14.35]Boom.
[26:20.48]I got a new fireball?
[26:21.30]You're amassing quite the collection of Tirangreal.
[26:24.25]Why don't you use your new fireball artifact against this fort?
[26:28.71]That's like... Is that a fireball?
[26:30.19]What is that?
[26:31.53]That thing's... A big molten bomb.
[26:37.33]The arch is there, Elena.
[26:38.53]You must watch where you're walking, child.
[26:41.54]Now, quickly climb up the wall and leave this dreadful place.
[26:45.40]The arch won't stay forever.
[26:49.53]Oh shit, it came down and hit me in the fuckin' eye.
[26:51.83]A piece of shrapnel just hit me in the face.
[26:55.30]Alright, what if I shoot one through the portal?
[27:00.96]Oh dear god!
[27:08.45]Steady, Elena.
[27:10.07]You've endured much, but learned much as well.
[27:13.88]The worst.
[27:14.24]Uh oh.
[27:14.42]Okay.
[27:30.42]In this time, you are an emissary of the White Tower.
[27:34.11]A diplomatic mission brought you to Faldara, an outpost on the Borderlands, whose soldiers hold the forces of the Dark One within the Blight.
[27:43.15]They didn't expect the sudden, concentrated assault that overwhelmed the Keep.
[27:47.83]No doubt in search of you.
[27:49.98]Now it's only a matter of time until the Trollocs and Murdral find the chamber in which you hide.
[27:55.54]Because you cannot channel, you are forced to rely on the Sister and Warder accompanying you for protection.
[28:01.70]Wait, I have... They are outnumbered.
[28:03.57]Edit the environment?
[28:04.13]Your only chance is to set traps for the invaders.
[28:06.89]Hold on a second.
[28:08.81]Okay, F10.
[28:09.47]There is only one exit.
[28:10.61]What is going on?
[28:11.59]And the invaders are likely just outside.
[28:13.93]That's where they'll enter.
[28:15.33]Two paths lead from this door to the main room where you'll be.
[28:19.05]You must channel the invaders through one of the corridors in order to ensure that they'll encounter your traps.
[28:24.57]Place a makeshift wall to block the shorter path.
[28:36.10]Okay, block the short path?
[28:37.32]Oh, wait, that was the short path.
[28:45.40]Very good, child.
[28:46.92]Now place two spear traps along the remaining corridor.
[28:50.17]It's tight enough to make the spears effective.
[28:52.35]Okay, spear trap.
[28:55.59]Not there, child.
[28:57.05]Well, good.
[28:58.29]You, please.
[29:02.55]Good.
[29:03.13]Now place one more spear trap.
[29:08.45]Although damaged by the spears, the Trollocs won't stop.
[29:11.79]They will likely just become angrier and charge out of the corridor into the main.
[29:16.33]A pit at the opening might make a nice welcome.
[29:21.99]Now position your companions, the sister and her warder.
[29:25.63]Although it would be safest to keep them in the main room, you can place them anywhere.
[29:32.25]Okay, +2... Oh, I already put them down.
[29:38.97]Uh... Can I just drop him down?
[29:40.19]Okay, press 0 until the portcullis is selected.
[29:42.13]Activate the portcullis by pointing at the portcullis icon and pressing the portcullis button.
[29:46.92]What is a portcullis?
[29:47.90]Oh, that.
[29:48.20]Okay.
[29:48.32]Okay.
[30:04.22]Can I fight?
[30:04.94]So I just walk around as like a Minecraft creative editor?
[30:09.16]Like I can't do anything?
[30:10.24]What happened to my spells?
[30:11.14]Where'd he go?
[30:11.44]What?
[30:11.78]What do you mean go now?
[30:36.41]attack fight fight this guy oh my god they could throw what do I go what do I do what do I do what do I do
[31:11.19]What?
[31:11.41]How do I leave?
[31:12.49]Uh oh.
[31:14.01]That guy just hit himself in the face with a fucking axe.
[31:18.39]That guy was hiding.
[31:23.67]This game is crazy.
[31:26.57]You are washed clean, Elena, of all ties that bind you to the world.
[31:30.27]That guy was hiding.
[31:31.07]You come to us washed clean in heart and soul.
[31:34.19]You are sealed to the White Tower now.
[31:37.19]You are ready.
[31:39.99]You are washed.
[31:43.02]Alright, well thanks for the tips.
[31:49.32]Alright, I think we're good.
[31:53.82]New game, medium.
[31:54.78]Here we go.
[31:59.44]Another age, called the Third Age by some.
[32:02.89]An age yet to come.
[32:04.65]An age long past.
[32:07.71]A wind rises in the Dragonmount.
[32:10.19]The wind is not the beginning.
[32:12.32]There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.
[32:16.92]But it is a beginning.
[32:20.62]The wind dives down through the streets of Tarvalon.
[32:23.40]The city surrounded by the White Tower.
[32:26.24]Shutters slam closed in its wake.
[32:28.63]People hug their cloaks and race inside their halls.
[32:32.12]Without knowing why, they sense that the wind brings a chill.
[32:36.22]It has nothing to do with the weather.
[32:41.11]Elena Sedai, the keeper of the Chronicles of the White Tower, the right hand of the Amalan Seat.
[32:48.10]is touched by the wind.
[32:50.78]She shivers.
[32:52.96]Elena is Aes Sedai, but she can't channel the One Power more than a trickle.
[32:59.17]Because of this, some wonder if her friendship with the Amalum isn't the only reason for her position.
[33:05.47]But few can question her mastery of the Tower's collection of Tyr Angrial.
[33:10.69]Artifacts from the age of legends that can perform wondrous tasks with the one power without requiring the user to channel.
[33:20.52]Elina is of the brown Aja.
[33:23.74]How many people got off the ropes whipped out of this tower do you think?
[33:27.46]Some dedicate themselves to finding and eliminating men that can channel like the red or championing worthy causes like the blue.
[33:36.58]The Brown Aja is dedicated to the gathering and preservation of knowledge.
[33:42.80]It's no wonder that Elena finds herself working late into the night.
[33:59.61]What is that?
[34:01.11]A report from the expedition of Brown Aja sisters that I sent to the Borderlands.
[34:05.91]And?
[34:08.49]It's not good news.
[34:10.45]They used the maps I discovered, but haven't found anything resembling a cache of Tirangreal or one of the Quendler seals.
[34:17.41]Even worse, they've had some trouble with the local White Cloaks.
[34:20.75]Apparently, the garrison leader hates Aes Sedai.
[34:24.16]White Cloaks?
[34:25.46]That's a nickname for the army known as the Children of the Light, because of their White Cloaks.
[34:30.14]They're fanatics.
[34:31.80]They claim they're battling the Dark One, but most of the time, they just terrorize the public.
[34:36.58]I don't like their tactics.
[34:39.47]Jesus.
[34:41.61]Don't do the knuckle knock and then the fist knock.
[34:49.62]Stick with one.
[34:51.50]Oh my god!
[34:52.38]Who the fuck is this guy?
[34:55.66]Oh boy, shave that off.
[35:11.28]Dude's got fucking four Charlie Brown hairs on the bottom of his chin.
[35:16.73]Did he just kill her with the bookcase?
[35:34.44]I've been played for a fool.
[35:36.47]The seals aren't here at all.
[35:37.75]We can go back in time.
[35:48.26]Oh, never mind.
[35:51.98]We all grieve for the loss of Ciaran Sedai, my child.
[35:56.23]There are 14 books.
[35:57.03]Public knowledge inside of the tower.
[36:18.61]I believe that this was his first visit.
[36:21.15]But how did he get in?
[36:22.11]Skip, are you crazy?
[36:22.99]How'd he get to my room?
[36:24.11]Ah, yes.
[36:26.55]Despite the casualties, I doubt that he could have made it to your chambers without assistance.
[36:32.19]Assistance?
[36:34.12]Black Aja.
[36:35.72]I have no proof, so I want to hear none of this from you outside of this room.
[36:41.08]But I have suspected for some time that a few of our sisters have allied with the Dark Ones.
[36:48.06]Oh no.
[36:48.34]I cannot say.
[36:49.76]Not yet.
[36:50.32]Why are you telling me?
[36:51.48]I was the only one left alive.
[36:54.28]Wouldn't that implicate me?
[36:56.59]You're not Black Aja, child.
[36:58.83]I'd stake my life on it.
[37:01.01]In fact, I already have.
[37:04.17]This man was here to take our seals.
[37:06.45]Although I can't guess why.
[37:08.25]But he didn't even come close to success.
[37:11.08]I love the... I love the models.
[37:13.64]The 3D models look really... I love the way they look.
[37:16.30]Regardless, he did manage to murder our sisters and steal your store of Tir Angrial.
[37:21.74]And the whole tower knows about it.
[37:23.46]That reminds me.
[37:24.98]There was a panel in the wall of my chamber that I'd never come across.
[37:29.07]It held an unfamiliar Tir Angrial.
[37:32.85]Yes, I know.
[37:34.50]I put that panel in your wall back when it was my chamber.
[37:38.39]The artifact inside was very important.
[37:41.89]This is what we need to discuss.
[37:44.61]The sitters of the hall are understandably furious.
[37:48.31]Right now, they are scattering our Home Guard into the countryside to search for the assassin, which they do against my wishes.
[37:55.96]Don't mistake me, child.
[37:57.64]I'm just as angry as the others.
[37:59.32]Okay.
[37:59.80]But I hesitate to leave the White Tower with a skeleton force to come look for a needle in a haystack.
[38:05.88]And this man carries my artifact.
[38:09.14]If he is discovered by someone not true to the Tower, I understand.
[38:13.42]What do you want from me?
[38:17.12]I believe this is yours.
[38:18.96]It's a report found on your desk.
[38:21.32]Given the handprint, the man has obviously read it.
[38:24.45]The report claims that a seal might be located in the Borderlands to the west.
[38:29.31]Unreal 1 has issues with FPS and tick rate.
[38:31.79]It's going to speed the game up.
[38:33.17]He may need to lock the frame rate in the game options.
[38:36.51]Okay.
[38:36.61]My eyes and ears along that path have confirmed that he is indeed heading southwest.
[38:40.98]That did seem really fast, so I might have to do that.
[38:42.96]He surrounded himself with a regiment of Trollocs.
[38:45.86]This slows him down and will make it difficult to cross the Manetherendral River since he can't travel through Whitebridge.
[38:53.35]If you hurry, you should be able to overtake him in the woods outside of Shadar Logoth.
[38:57.84]Alright, let's go.
[38:58.94]Try to catch him before he reaches the city.
[39:01.28]You certainly don't want to be chasing after him inside of that cursed place.
[39:04.56]So I'm going to have to lock this EXE to what, 30?
[39:08.70]30 FPS?
[39:09.08]50 FPS?
[39:10.01]I can't channel the One Power more than a trickle.
[39:12.87]Even he knew that.
[39:14.41]I can't trust anyone else.
[39:16.89]You've been studying our Tirang Real for years.
[39:19.69]No one is more proficient in their use.
[39:22.52]These artifacts can make you as powerful as any other sister, if not more.
[39:27.26]Take whatever we have left.
[39:29.40]Be careful, though.
[39:30.76]He's obviously been trained to use Tir Angriel himself.
[39:34.17]Also, watch for any of our forces tracking the assassin.
[39:37.73]They may get lucky, and you must reach him before they do.
[39:41.89]Find this man and bring back what he has stolen.
[39:45.13]More than you know depends on it.
[39:47.37]Okay, so I need to... NVIDIA Control Panel Limiter does not work with the game.
[39:50.93]Okay.
[39:51.17]Alright, try to track down the assassin.
[39:52.41]Research what you carry by selecting an artifact.
[39:55.13]Alright.
[39:55.51]Cool.
[39:55.71]Can I do it in here?
[39:57.07]Okay, let's go to Hardware.
[39:57.65]VSync is on.
[40:18.64]Okay, hold on a second.
[40:25.32]So, if NVIDIA Control Panel might need a third-party app to do it.
[40:33.69]We'll see how it goes.
[40:34.43]Alright, I can do Air Pulse.
[40:45.66]Alright, so I gotta research some shit.
[40:49.11]It's only an issue at greater than 120 FPS.
[40:52.99]I have VSync on, but I'm at 100.
[40:54.71]Wait, what did I just get?
[41:00.19]VSync is on and I'm at 120 right now.
[41:06.60]What is this music?
[41:07.36]Can I go in the water?
[41:20.18]Okay, I can't go in the water.
[41:23.35]The GOG version may not be an issue.
[41:24.75]I played this week.
[41:27.39]Did not run into issues.
[41:28.23]This is the GOG version, so I wonder.
[41:36.33]Oh, shit.
[41:37.93]Investigation going underway here.
[41:41.93]I got the heal spell.
[41:42.76]Should I do it?
[42:00.18]This series is so violent.
[42:02.54]Power of wind!
[42:10.17]Alright, I killed him.
[42:20.28]Damn, I didn't know it was going to be this much blood.
[42:30.13]Oh my god!
[42:30.77]This person's got ribs around!
[42:32.21]This is a violent game!
[42:33.42]Okay, I made it across here.
[42:45.07]Can I help that guy?
[42:49.45]Oh!
[43:04.05]Alright, I do love how the big bad wolf strategy works.
[43:12.43]Leave any goodies in here?
[43:13.25]Ooh, what's this?
[43:15.58]Dart?
[43:16.44]I got dart.
[43:17.52]How do I use it?
[43:23.46]Okay.
[43:23.82]The dart, Terango, focuses the one power into a weak burst of energy.
[43:28.70]Although a single charge may not necessarily inflict much damage, the artifact can spray multiple darts at a victim in a very short time.
[43:35.48]I got 55 of these.
[43:39.30]Yeah, what is this?
[43:40.35]Is this like the official theme song?
[43:44.57]I love how this looks though.
[43:47.12]This is the type of video game that I want to...
[44:07.40]I got him.
[44:09.78]I thought that guy was friendly.
[44:14.16]Oh, it's a cookie.
[44:15.86]How do I get the cookie?
[44:18.30]Alright, I got the fireball.
[44:23.29]Are these infinite?
[44:24.23]I only have three.
[44:25.17]Let's go back to air.
[44:29.43]Save.
[44:34.97]I think that's crouch.
[44:38.95]Can I climb?
[44:46.54]Oh, wait a minute.
[44:46.98]What's that?
[44:50.64]I got... What was that?
[45:01.21]Why do I think standing this far away in blood... Breath is like a shotgun.
[45:13.66]How did you predict where I was going to go?
[45:26.62]Alright, save game.
[45:35.94]That's like a melee spell.
[45:38.95]I don't want to use all my darts, but how do I want to get this one?
[45:43.89]Can I sneak in here?
[45:52.92]Damn it.
[45:53.24]How do I get around there?
[45:55.96]Did you find the Elden Ring?
[45:57.10]What happened to my... Wait.
[45:58.84]What just happened to my darts?
[46:05.39]What?
[46:05.55]I left a bag on the ground?
[46:15.03]Wait, hold on.
[46:15.61]I can get up there from here.
[46:21.35]How did I do that before?
[46:24.40]How did I do that?
[46:36.98]Hold it.
[46:39.05]I feel like I pressed C before.
[46:43.15]What even is crouch?
[46:50.66]Okay.
[46:53.08]Turn left.
[46:53.64]Next hand.
[46:54.28]Previous hand.
[46:55.62]Drop item.
[46:57.50]Strafe.
[46:59.34]Where's crouch?
[47:00.40]Is there not a crouch?
[47:02.94]Maybe I have to hold right button?
[47:10.79]Drop item is control.
[47:13.63]How did I get up here?
[47:16.91]Maybe I wasn't supposed to be able to do that.
[47:27.97]Hey, relax.
[47:28.97]We haven't... Ooh.
[47:35.11]We're not even in the... We're not even in the first area yet.
[47:37.80]Chill.
[47:39.20]This game is cool.
[47:40.34]I like it.
[47:40.82]Alright, I got personal shield.
[47:48.98]Aye, look at that.
[47:50.90]More darts.
[47:51.54]Good.
[47:55.32]Yup.
[47:56.66]Okay.
[47:58.30]Look at all these secrets I'm getting.
[47:59.53]You wouldn't have fucking gotten these.
[48:00.61]Did I just hurt myself?
[48:04.53]Alright, I'm good to go.
[48:07.49]Boy darts.
[48:20.64]Holy shit.
[48:25.87]Death to the invader!
[48:27.54]Death to the ranger!
[48:33.76]Ranger!
[48:35.50]Oh yeah, you got yourself on your right butt of shit, didn't you mate?
[48:39.98]Why don't we take her to the street?
[48:42.48]Whatever they say.
[48:47.54]Oh my god.
[49:02.03]Can I do anything with this?
[49:08.22]Let's take it outside!
[49:09.62]Yeah, what the fuck was that?
[49:12.31]Hey!
[49:35.27]Okay, wait.
[49:40.29]This is where the guy's standing before.
[49:46.37]Oh my god!
[49:47.07]Is there experience points or anything?
[49:54.86]I think that guy spawned in.
[49:55.94]That was weird.
[49:57.14]That was actually kind of scary.
[49:58.42]This game is fucking sick!
[50:21.82]Why are they doing the FromSoftware dodge thing anytime you attack?
[50:31.49]Come on, man.
[50:41.45]Does this happen in the Wheel of Time?
[50:43.78]I thought it was a game about traveling through time and I thought it was like Doctor Who.
[50:49.43]Is that just wrong?
[50:50.21]They're eating people.
[51:03.62]This is basically how it all starts.
[51:15.27]That's a shitload of them.
[51:16.45]They're all chasing after one guy!
[51:21.70]This really is like Elden Ring.
[51:23.34]Some invader just aggroed everything.
[51:25.18]Just running around.
[51:26.20]I feel like I'm playing co-op Dark Souls.
[51:42.61]Oh my god!
[51:43.29]Okay.
[51:46.09]I don't want to use these yet.
[51:52.78]I definitely don't want to miss any items.
[51:54.94]Do you like Doctor 2?
[51:55.74]I've never seen a single episode in my whole life.
[51:58.53]Not one.
[52:00.59]Wait, no.
[52:01.29]I did see one episode where he went into a phone booth.
[52:05.33]And that was it.
[52:08.53]And then I changed the channel.
[52:16.47]Although that may have been Bill and Ted's awesome adventure.
[52:19.53]I'm not sure.
[52:20.25]I could be mixing them up.
[52:26.34]happens in every single episode yeah and he gets in and he goes um whoa gnarly dude he plays like an electric guitar in his hand like a air guitar how many have you guys not seen bill and Ted
[52:56.87]Where's boss?
[52:57.49]He missed though.
[53:31.90]And let me alone.
[53:45.70]Of course he has to do the wipe your fingers.
[53:47.34]Okay.
[53:47.44]This is definitely an excerpt from the book.
[53:49.10]Alright, so we're going to go through the city, the ancient city.
[54:20.12]Save it for sure.
[54:27.09]What the fuck was that?
[54:31.11]How many animals are up here?
[54:42.70]Ooh!
[54:48.94]Wait.
[54:49.12]I can get it through here.
[54:55.84]Nice.
[54:56.04]Alright.
[54:56.54]15 fireballs.
[54:59.45]I have 32 health.
[55:00.41]That's not good.
[55:07.59]I unironically like this game.
[55:09.09]I think it's fun.
[55:15.42]Rats.
[55:29.71]Should go the other way first.
[55:30.49]There's probably items.
[55:42.34]Okay, this is not the bitrate doing that.
[55:43.94]The game is doing this.
[55:48.24]Oh, what is that?
[55:53.64]The Seeker?
[55:55.14]More darts?
[55:55.64]What's the Seeker?
[55:58.36]Seeker launches an explosive projectile at a target, gathering speed as it hunts the target down.
[56:03.91]Okay, so it's a homing missile?
[56:05.93]Cool.
[56:07.51]I need heals.
[56:11.65]It's funny you're playing this like a tactical shooter.
[56:15.69]I mean, it is.
[56:16.95]Do you see how much dodging?
[56:18.63]This is like an old boomer shooter type game.
[56:25.32]Alright, let's go.
[56:29.42]It is an FPS, yeah.
[56:30.54]Alright, did I miss anything?
[56:42.77]What the fuck is that thing?
[56:46.43]I got it.
[56:52.53]I killed it.
[56:52.95]What is it?
[56:56.33]Oh!
[56:57.71]This book seems kind of cool.
[56:59.09]Is this in the TV show?
[57:00.09]Okay.
[57:15.82]Really actually needed this.
[57:22.99]Yeah, it's in the show.
[57:30.19]I don't know if there's monsters in it.
[57:34.34]I actually thought it was like a Doctor Who.
[57:35.84]Like, I'm going to pick the phone up and we're going to travel back to when George Washington was there.
[57:40.36]The Wheel of Time.
[57:44.38]And there are dinosaurs or something.
[57:45.88]I didn't know it was like this.
[57:46.68]Ah!
[58:00.91]Oh my god, I just smoked him!
[58:10.59]Oh shit.
[58:12.31]Do they have pathing all the way up here?
[58:13.77]No they don't, right?
[58:19.77]That's actually scary because they're gonna end up right next to me.
[58:22.44]Do they have pathing all the way up here?
[58:31.24]No?
[58:32.16]They're both right there?
[58:33.64]Is one riding on the other one's back?
[58:53.28]Oh my god!
[59:06.72]Yep.
[59:09.99]We're good.
[59:10.87]Nice.
[59:11.29]Perfect.
[59:18.03]It's kind of like Dark Messiah.
[59:19.65]It is kind of like Dark Messiah, except there's no kick people off of cliff.
[59:27.98]Excuse me?
[59:41.65]uh I'm gonna put the fireballs away for now coming up on the first break I'm very interested I'm gonna keep playing this dark messiah with guns I at least want to kill the boss and that guy might be a major story character in all 14 books what I'm describing might not even be possible but whatever
[60:20.35]Did I come this way?
[60:20.99]I think I'm going backwards.
[60:22.87]Can I make this jump?
[60:38.05]Oh, no.
[60:38.55]Can I jump from there?
[60:42.69]This game is hundreds of years ahead of the main story.
[60:48.89]Okay, there we go.
[60:51.66]I don't know anything about this series at all.
[60:55.54]Ooh, alright.
[61:06.03]Should I go to there?
[61:07.45]Or should I go to there?
[61:13.31]Ooh, nice.
[61:13.83]Okay.
[61:18.55]That hurts.
[61:23.23]More fireballs.
[61:23.91]What is that doing?
[61:28.84]We'll find out.
[61:29.36]Let's take a break.
[61:32.60]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[61:35.30]You've read the books on stream.
[61:38.43]Wait, it's two... It's 100 years before the main story.
[61:44.67]You guys seem to not have your Wheel of Time lore completely in check here.
[61:49.80]Is it 200 years after?
[61:50.92]Is it 100 years before?
[61:52.00]Is it in the middle?
[61:55.81]Be right back.
[65:15.45]and back looks like we got another 30 seconds or so it's implied and believe that time is a cycle but I'm not going to read that that might be like the last page of the fucking book I'm not reading anything about this whole series over here
[65:42.99]Somebody could just... And by the way, you're gonna get banned if you do that.
[65:53.37]It's a cycle.
[65:53.91]It's the last and the first page.
[65:57.95]Oh, damn.
[65:59.19]Okay.
[66:02.37]Damn.
[66:04.13]Look at you.
[66:04.53]Alright.
[66:08.54]I think I'm ready.
[66:09.62]Let's go.
[66:24.00]Maybe not.
[66:32.14]Sorry, but you don't you don't jump on a dart main like that.
[66:35.94]You're a melee strength build you gotta.
[66:38.28]I'm a luck dart X build.
[66:40.77]The stupidest fucking thing you've ever done.
[66:52.69]What?
[66:53.51]What the hell is that?
[66:56.15]What do I do?
[67:00.81]Okay, I'm like snaking myself.
[67:02.56]Do I blow it away with my own air?
[67:12.72]Oh, that sucks.
[67:13.40]That actually hurts.
[67:14.20]It's just following me the whole time.
[67:17.04]What am I supposed to do about this?
[67:21.33]What?
[67:28.31]Ow!
[67:29.61]What the fuck just killed me?
[67:31.81]You fucking camper.
[67:33.33]Fuck you.
[67:35.58]Get out of here.
[67:50.68]Nah, I ain't gonna go down that way.
[67:53.26]I ain't going down that way.
[68:07.35]Alright, this time I'm not gonna just sit around and get hit by this.
[68:13.69]Shield up.
[68:21.32]Am I good?
[68:32.40]Ooh, I got the shift spell.
[68:40.45]Let's go.
[68:41.01]Alright, left or right?
[68:52.90]Wait, don't do that.
[68:57.23]I jump around on this?
[69:01.61]No.
[69:06.76]OK, where do I want to go then?
[69:09.42]It's down here.
[69:11.46]Wait, isn't this where I came from?
[69:13.16]No.
[69:19.78]Wait.
[69:23.84]Wait a second.
[69:25.32]Is this where I came from?
[69:25.96]Do you ever read books on stream and consider doing a read-along of the Lord of the Rings?
[69:34.87]Uh, no.
[69:36.71]Use the shift?
[69:38.25]Oh, I gotta go back around and shift through this door.
[69:42.14]Right?
[69:42.36]I gotta get the thing, come down here, and then shift through this door.
[69:50.43]Still waiting on the typewriter stream.
[69:51.93]I will pay.
[69:54.89]How much you paying?
[69:57.86]Wait, did I fuck this whole thing up?
[69:58.90]Did I softlock myself?
[70:25.43]Okay, so you get up here.
[70:27.29]You get the spell.
[70:28.14]And then it's like, oh, go through the wall.
[70:29.86]But it just takes you back to the beginning.
[70:34.26]So why would I... Shouldn't I just come back down?
[70:36.64]And go through the door?
[70:39.00]Did I miss something?
[70:41.37]Hey, are you serious?
[70:44.87]Go use it elsewhere.
[70:45.73]That's what I mean.
[70:46.19]Just go back the other way I just came?
[71:04.13]Oh, it is blocked.
[71:05.03]So wait, so how the hell do I do that?
[71:08.13]Oh, great.
[71:12.90]Taking so much unnecessary damage.
[71:14.44]Alright, so I can shift.
[71:22.18]I'll shift through this and then... But that just puts me back at the... I can't get it more than once.
[71:29.38]Alright, so shift.
[71:29.88]Shift.
[71:31.69]OK.
[71:33.91]But now I. Yes, I have to.
[71:38.61]Do I have to jump around up here then?
[71:56.48]You just chill for awhile.
[71:58.32]Is it breakable?
[71:59.02]Maybe it is breakable.
[72:01.15]Oh my God, it's breakable.
[72:03.21]You are a genius.
[72:08.39]Nope.
[72:19.54]I had no idea what he was doing.
[72:21.26]It's OK, neither do I.
[72:30.11]Uh oh.
[72:32.33]Uh, I'm going to go this door first.
[72:35.45]Cookie coin.
[72:40.52]Then we're going to go.
[72:42.60]We're here.
[72:42.92]We're going to this door.
[72:46.40]No, not.
[72:46.88]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[72:48.00]Through here.
[72:51.20]Nope.
[72:55.37]Nope.
[73:08.68]Fucking kill him!
[73:09.80]What the hell?
[73:10.50]Why wouldn't he die?
[73:13.58]I shot that guy 9,000 times in his face.
[73:27.90]Hold on.
[73:37.78]Put the shield on.
[73:38.66]I'm using my homing missiles on this.
[73:53.57]Ooh!
[73:54.75]Secret rooftop area.
[74:03.91]I'm gonna get that heal first.
[74:07.58]Does it be a good snipe spot?
[74:08.68]Oh, actually it might.
[74:09.44]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[74:11.58]I'm a fucking seal.
[74:23.43]Ah!
[74:24.19]They can come up here?
[74:24.95]No, reset, reset.
[74:26.89]Can I reset it?
[74:39.86]I don't know if I could fly all the way up here.
[74:41.10]That's so stupid.
[74:41.80]Alright, so now let's get... There's so much shit over there.
[74:52.03]Another shield.
[74:55.53]Good.
[74:57.15]Alright, here it comes.
[74:57.87]Alright, where is he?
[75:13.39]I'm going to fall through this, aren't I?
[75:24.19]Save, save, save.
[75:25.13]I got it, I got it.
[75:33.84]Meteor the floor?
[75:34.56]It's not a bad idea.
[75:38.64]It's a good thought.
[75:52.82]What the fuck?
[75:53.88]That was the worst scare I've ever had in my life.
[75:59.30]That was awful.
[76:06.43]Something is sprinting at me.
[76:07.49]That was actually horrible.
[76:15.73]I just never...
[76:19.87]Who's... Nice try!
[76:37.56]Okay, can we take a second to figure out what the fuck just happened?
[76:40.32]Where'd that chalice go?
[76:45.37]Okay, Mickey, relax.
[76:46.81]Um, there's a lot of crazy shit happening.
[76:51.37]Save it.
[76:52.19]Okay.
[77:01.09]I gotta fight that guy that was on the stairs.
[77:04.16]There's a bunch of items I need to still get.
[77:05.46]I have- at least I have three heals.
[77:07.40]Okay, hold on.
[77:08.98]I got so turned- Give me a brick.
[77:25.81]Why'd you just get so turnt?
[77:27.51]Because it's... I got scared.
[77:31.61]Shit just creeps up on you in this game.
[77:39.71]Oh, not this asshole.
[77:57.11]Didn't go the right way.
[78:10.38]OK.
[78:11.28]Oh, that's a lot of stuff.
[78:13.26]Yeah, get it.
[78:16.93]I have ten heels now.
[78:18.33]I got so much.
[78:19.05]I got so many items.
[78:31.09]Sorry, didn't take damage.
[78:35.72]Dude, this game is fucked up!
[78:38.46]This is scary shit!
[78:39.80]This stuff just attacks you out of nowhere!
[78:41.64]This stuff can go through the walls, do you understand?
[79:00.39]Okay, another cookie.
[79:01.09]Good.
[79:04.59]Where is that guy?
[79:09.99]Oh.
[79:10.13]This city is a cursed maze.
[79:12.92]Blood and ashes, where is the exit?
[79:14.98]Stop, murderer!
[79:19.20]I agree.
[79:21.80]Witch, this is your fault.
[79:24.83]Did he just call me a bitch?
[79:26.41]I'm actually asking.
[79:27.87]Why didn't you just let me go?
[79:36.89]This game is crazy.
[79:38.05]I love it.
[79:40.26]A witch OK right?
[79:41.62]I'm a witch.
[79:55.18]The assassin has put himself in the heart of the web making progress.
[79:58.48]The streets of the city are deadly.
[80:00.10]The bowels are only worse.
[80:02.02]I can't imagine what they hide and I hope I don't find out.
[80:05.56]Wait a minute.
[80:07.37]There's multiple ways this can end.
[80:10.83]The longer the assassin evades you, the greater the chance that he will die before you regain the Terran Grail that he carries.
[80:18.76]So he can die.
[80:30.52]You stupid thing.
[80:37.74]Alright, I'm just going to go this way, whatever.
[80:40.10]Good pick.
[80:40.68]That was a good choice.
[80:43.15]Great choice.
[80:44.69]Good, yeah.
[80:45.45]Oh, good.
[80:46.89]Excellent.
[80:54.81]I almost did it again.
[80:59.03]Wait, they're all like this.
[81:01.65]Oh, shit.
[81:02.37]Am I going to drown under here?
[81:11.00]My teacher didn't tell me I could.
[81:23.07]Press this!
[81:30.73]I gotta find him and I gotta kill him quick.
[81:41.24]Wait, I can shoot those and they go away?
[81:42.60]Well, that changes everything.
[81:46.43]Guys, we're good.
[81:51.57]Do you want scanners for this game?
[81:55.29]Maybe pretty soon here.
[81:56.15]We might need some scanning.
[81:58.81]I'm good for right now, though.
[81:59.50]I haven't gotten too lost.
[82:09.39]I'm gonna blast the absolute hell out of him if I find him though.
[82:11.95]He definitely went up there.
[82:21.30]What is that?
[82:24.92]You got the decay.
[82:27.20]What is this thing?
[82:28.64]For a short while, decay slowly drains away both the target's health and the charges of all held artifacts.
[82:38.32]I'm saving that for the boss.
[82:54.49]Get that heal.
[82:59.31]OK, I'm gonna have only 10 heals max, I think.
[83:13.37]OK.
[83:15.21]What we got?
[83:18.48]Did I go down there already?
[83:23.10]Went through here.
[83:23.68]Let me just look over.
[83:27.88]Alright.
[83:29.30]Probably a lever I can pull, right?
[83:33.08]Why is my leg itchy?
[83:39.26]What's that sound?
[83:44.68]Okay.
[83:47.18]Progress.
[83:48.58]There's a lever right there.
[83:50.54]Two levers.
[83:52.01]Little puzzle.
[83:53.69]Let's go.
[83:54.27]Easy.
[84:09.02]How do I get the... Can I shoot them?
[84:20.79]Oh.
[84:21.97]Is it just open?
[84:23.27]I can't get the other side?
[84:24.07]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[84:31.40]There you go.
[84:41.82]Got it.
[84:45.67]Items?
[84:46.21]Yep.
[84:46.65]Come on.
[84:47.85]I think it's on his hammer.
[84:55.45]The streamer's brain is huge.
[84:58.14]Yeah, I know, dude.
[84:59.74]I just looked over a chat and somebody said jump on the door.
[85:03.58]And then I just did it.
[85:06.34]Why does the rain hurt me?
[85:22.01]That one didn't count.
[85:32.24]Why am I so jumpy with this?
[85:33.92]I thought it was acid rain.
[85:50.92]Alright, I gotta find this guy.
[85:51.98]Find him quickly, otherwise you're gonna get killed.
[85:53.62]Okay, I shot it once last time and it went away and it's not... It's here forever again.
[86:05.80]I don't get it.
[86:11.28]Puzzle!
[86:11.62]Secret!
[86:13.64]Dude, this is... I hate this!
[86:23.39]What the fuck?
[86:24.37]Stop!
[86:24.91]I gotta move.
[86:25.45]I just have to move.
[86:26.97]Even if there's items in the room.
[86:27.85]Whatever.
[86:28.15]There you are!
[86:33.79]No!
[86:34.15]Yeah!
[86:59.40]Fire alarm thingy?
[87:12.03]Am I in a Discord call with Poke right now?
[87:20.87]Don't drown, please.
[87:23.82]Excuse me?
[87:27.40]What are you talking about?
[87:33.31]I can't swim over there.
[87:45.29]Current is too strong.
[87:53.00]What am I supposed to do?
[88:03.62]Oh, hell yeah.
[88:05.88]Water shield.
[88:13.33]There's so much stuff under here.
[88:17.91]Come on, come on, come on.
[88:18.77]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[88:22.51]Go.
[88:25.63]Ah.
[88:28.42]Ah.
[88:32.59]Yeah, that's right.
[88:33.05]Get out of here.
[88:34.59]Punk.
[88:38.06]Scared the shit out of me.
[88:39.18]Not gonna lie.
[88:41.44]Alright, water shield.
[88:42.52]Let's research it.
[88:46.48]Ooh, I can swim with this.
[88:53.16]Hell yeah, let's go.
[88:59.86]What?
[89:15.96]Oh hey bros.
[89:31.05]It's ugly down here.
[89:33.67]Something in there for sure.
[89:37.81]I can't breathe.
[89:38.45]I cannot breathe under here.
[89:40.64]Wait, does the watershed let me breathe?
[89:45.71]I don't know.
[89:46.09]I think so.
[90:01.36]Fuck.
[90:04.76]Damn it, OK, I gotta I gotta I gotta I gotta I gotta talk.
[90:08.38]I gotta learn how to talk.
[90:28.15]I know you're down here.
[90:30.33]I know you're following me.
[90:33.45]You want those trinkets I stole from the tower, right?
[90:36.61]I hid them.
[90:38.15]I hid them somewhere in the city.
[90:40.01]You'll never find them.
[90:40.78]Where is he talking from?
[90:41.78]You'll see me, I said I. He's here.
[90:49.06]Worse than anything up above.
[90:51.10]And he knows I'm here.
[90:53.43]I can hear it coming for me.
[90:59.87]Why is he monologuing?
[91:01.41]Save me!
[91:30.46]Save him?
[91:30.98]I don't know where he is.
[91:34.50]He's not in that one.
[91:42.98]He's not- He's not in any of these!
[91:46.26]Where the fuck is he?
[91:48.00]Is that- Wait, is that him?
[91:51.14]You got the swap places trinket.
[91:56.07]Is he already dead?
[92:02.54]I gotta swap places with the enemy over there, right?
[92:13.66]Okay, swap places with you.
[92:17.39]Come here.
[92:23.85]Switches your position with that of your target.
[92:25.55]Swap places tricks any weaves that currently track you.
[92:28.71]Okay, so let's do it.
[92:34.97]Are you fucking kidding me?
[92:37.85]Sorry, I'm not supposed to be swearing, but... What do you mean he doesn't fit?
[92:55.64]Oh, that's bad.
[92:56.34]No, it's not.
[92:59.22]I'm fine.
[93:07.18]The uh, oh that was dangerously cheesy Ah
[93:35.28]That guy did so, um, no.
[93:36.44]That one doesn't count.
[93:47.19]They said there's a wheel of time game?
[93:55.92]Apparently there is.
[94:01.84]Yeah, this takes place 10,000 years after the fourth book in the series.
[94:07.80]There he is.
[94:10.62]Oh, no, that's not him.
[94:11.30]Never mind.
[94:18.02]What is this one?
[94:19.00]Fork?
[94:21.02]For a short time, Fork erects a shield.
[94:23.64]Although artifact weaves that penetrate this shield will affect you.
[94:27.45]A duplicate attack is launched back at the originator.
[94:31.17]I don't get it.
[94:42.60]It's just a mirror shield.
[94:45.17]Yeah, hello buddy.
[94:50.69]I'm not getting jump by anymore.
[94:58.49]OK, I think we're getting close.
[95:06.22]Definitely going to something going on in there.
[95:11.52]Hi.
[95:17.59]Spirit Shield.
[95:23.26]What does that do?
[95:25.08]Spirit Shield forms a barrier of the principle space that I've been attacking you.
[95:28.22]Alright.
[95:32.62]I'm just gonna throw grenades at him.
[95:42.63]That's what I'm doing.
[95:45.19]There he is.
[95:55.96]Holy shit.
[96:04.23]Run.
[96:08.81]I get this tons of.
[96:13.97]Spirit shield.
[96:15.41]Bomb cookie.
[96:18.67]Another spirit shield.
[96:23.70]Let's kill it.
[96:34.52]Oh my God, I'm almost dead.
[96:35.98]Oh yeah, eat this.
[96:59.36]Okay, I'm not doing this right.
[97:13.93]Okay.
[97:15.79]What?
[97:21.55]What?
[97:23.23]Oh my god, those are all my body parts!
[97:26.93]What a little shit!
[97:30.47]It's a boss fight after a boss fight.
[97:32.39]You dick.
[97:33.43]That's so unfair.
[97:34.39]Guy doesn't know where he's going.
[97:41.08]Hey, chat, is it this way?
[97:43.54]No, I went in there before already.
[97:46.76]I think it's the right door.
[97:50.23]No, I think I was here already.
[97:52.71]That boss was fun, though.
[97:53.51]I think it's this way.
[97:54.99]No, I don't remember.
[97:56.43]Have I been here before?
[98:00.86]Alright.
[98:02.06]I'm going to run and get the items.
[98:03.09]We already saw the cool animation.
[98:04.17]I don't care.
[98:05.79]I'm getting every item and I'm going to sit and just going to spam.
[98:16.45]Just get the item.
[98:29.83]I tried to jump over it like an idiot.
[98:49.62]That's a stupid idea too.
[98:50.66]Alright, here we go.
[99:19.01]Hey!
[99:21.43]Why am I already dead?
[99:22.53]Fuck you, stupid ass game.
[99:26.89]Okay, I'm gonna run away and save it.
[99:48.42]I'm not going to aggro him at all.
[99:49.94]I'm going to save it in the corner.
[99:52.32]Spam Seekers at him.
[99:54.88]Good thing I just did that.
[99:59.53]Did you spoil the whole book?
[100:03.47]Is this the last page of the book?
[100:06.46]This has got to be it, right?
[100:08.18]Oh, God.
[100:12.30]Here we go.
[100:30.23]Gotta be enough.
[100:30.75]Okay, did it.
[100:42.58]Where is he?
[100:53.09]Fuck you, I feel like I'm playing Quake.
[100:59.70]Wait, it's supposed to reflect the spell back.
[101:03.42]Okay.
[101:13.53]Why is it not working?
[101:15.95]Oh my God, this guy's got shit falling on him now.
[101:18.94]He's so screwed.
[101:21.44]He's going to be able to outrun this forever.
[101:41.91]Fuck it.
[101:42.29]I'm going back to Dart.
[101:43.23]I got him.
[101:55.27]That was so easy.
[101:57.84]What?
[101:58.10]Enough.
[101:59.20]Spare me.
[102:00.72]Light, you deserve to die a thousand times for what you've done.
[102:05.12]That was so simple!
[102:06.70]His voice is so familiar.
[102:08.60]You don't refuse Ishmael when he commands you, my dear.
[102:31.22]You're a dark friend.
[102:32.92]One of the elephants from Twinsman's Odyssey.
[102:36.47]And by the way you ordered those Trollocs around, I'd say you had some status.
[102:42.67]Trollocs don't obey pawns.
[102:44.87]They eat them.
[102:46.47]Status?
[102:47.89]Not anymore, I'd wager.
[102:50.23]Ishmael sent me to the White Tower.
[102:52.25]I was to walk in, steal a Quendalar seal, and bring it to him.
[102:56.39]Agents inside were supposed to lead me right to it.
[102:59.17]Simple.
[103:00.09]Bloodless.
[103:01.51]Instead, they led me to your chamber, nowhere near anything that resembled a seal, and forced me to kill a number of sisters in order to escape.
[103:09.80]Now I've been marked.
[103:11.80]I won't be able to go anywhere without looking over my shoulder for ice to die.
[103:16.56]My life is worthless.
[103:18.36]If you want pity, look elsewhere.
[103:21.16]I'm waiting for you to tell me where you've hidden my trinkets.
[103:24.84]Otherwise I would have put you down already like a rabid hound.
[103:31.24]You can't lie.
[103:33.36]All Aes Sedai are bound by the Three Oaths.
[103:36.63]Tell me that you'll spare my life, and I'll show you where the Tirangriel are.
[103:40.91]Otherwise, we'll be sitting here a long time.
[103:47.46]Why did you come here to hide?
[103:49.70]It's about the most terrible place I can imagine.
[103:52.10]Out of the pot and into the fire, eh?
[103:54.83]Aww.
[104:22.95]I suppose that's as good as I'm going to get.
[104:25.53]Let's go.
[104:25.93]Do I have a companion now?
[104:40.04]Just look!
[104:41.78]More gold than I've ever seen!
[104:44.08]More than I could have dreamed of!
[104:46.12]What can Ishamel offer that compares to this?
[104:50.15]I thought he was being sarcastic because there's nothing in the room.
[104:53.23]But it's back there.
[104:54.93]He's going to betray us right now.
[104:57.17]There's no way he doesn't.
[105:26.06]Alright.
[105:26.64]Was that a good thing or a bad thing?
[105:35.25]Didn't seem good.
[105:58.30]Why did that not happen to us?
[106:03.74]Who's this monkey?
[106:06.18]Okay.
[106:07.17]That was sad.
[106:12.03]He was just trying to help.
[106:38.21]He probably said everybody back up first.
[106:41.70]Thank the light.
[106:43.30]Keeper, we need your help.
[106:45.44]We tracked the assassin to this city, but found the entrance blocked by rock.
[106:49.62]We managed to find another way in further down the wall, but it might as well be miles from here.
[106:55.02]Shortly after we entered, a swarm of those horrible creatures attacked us.
[106:59.55]We might have been able to defend ourselves against them, but the mist itself rose up behind us and killed nearly half our number.
[107:06.83]We scattered.
[107:07.75]Many of our party were separated.
[107:10.03]Even now they're somewhere out there.
[107:12.35]The few here managed to stay together.
[107:14.73]Our original entrance is blocked, so we decided to make our way here and try to dig our way through the rubble.
[107:20.63]We've made a lot of progress, but I think the city knows we're here, and it's sending its monsters to destroy us.
[107:27.70]The UV wrapping looks absurd.
[107:28.60]Everything looks kind of crazy.
[107:30.04]Okay.
[107:30.26]Stay alive Until Dawn?
[107:31.30]Oh, this is one of those trap ones.
[107:32.39]Defend yourself and your troops.
[107:36.71]Attempt to gather more Terran Grail or search for the missing sisters and wardens.
[107:39.87]Okay.
[107:39.99]Okay.
[107:57.47]They're giving us some shit here.
[108:01.97]What?
[108:02.59]Oh, no, no, no.
[108:03.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[108:03.68]We're just going?
[108:06.76]Don't split up.
[108:07.24]Why is everybody splitting up?
[108:08.82]Don't split up, you idiots.
[108:10.14]Why are you splitting up?
[108:11.90]What's wrong with you guys?
[108:13.39]Oh, shit.
[108:14.23]Are you alright?
[108:15.85]I'm not alright.
[108:16.65]I didn't save it.
[108:18.01]I'm actually mad.
[108:34.15]I think I just killed somebody.
[108:35.73]Oops.
[108:36.57]I killed a friend.
[108:37.37]Um... Get out of the room!
[108:43.10]Wait, I can put down traps!
[108:46.96]What the hell is that?
[108:51.98]I'm electrocuting this guy!
[108:57.15]Oh no!
[109:05.28]Dude, this is like the end of the book.
[109:11.36]I'm gonna die.
[109:18.72]Okay, so what the hell, man?
[109:20.20]Let's go back to Dart.
[109:29.76]Dart is so much better than everything else.
[109:37.05]Now get out of this room!
[109:38.45]Get out of here!
[109:40.69]You fucking morons!
[109:53.29]At least he made it out.
[109:54.15]There's something in here.
[110:00.74]What is that?
[110:12.39]Alright, stay alive!
[110:18.39]They're just going to... You know, it's exactly... Whatever.
[110:23.29]I got chain lightning, personal illusion.
[110:26.97]They all just killed themselves in here.
[110:28.31]They walked in here and just got comboed by the floating shit.
[110:34.32]Okay, I'm getting ready.
[110:37.72]Chain lightning.
[110:42.31]What the hell is that?
[110:45.04]Excuse me?
[110:49.02]Oh my!
[110:57.79]Nice job!
[110:58.83]Nice job, honestly.
[110:59.93]Actually, nice job.
[111:07.79]Average raid finder group?
[111:09.11]Yeah, honestly.
[111:11.92]Give me all this.
[111:22.60]Don't watch out.
[111:25.75]Good.
[111:28.65]Stay alive.
[111:33.07]I think the top right is the time.
[111:36.05]I almost killed this person.
[111:46.07]The sky is getting lighter.
[111:47.27]Alright.
[111:52.14]Chain lighting.
[111:52.52]This is the worst spell in the whole game.
[111:58.80]This spell sucks absolute dick.
[112:01.26]What a shit spell.
[112:16.20]Chain lightning, except it's a melee spell.
[112:21.86]That just sucks ass.
[112:24.64]I have fire cookies.
[112:26.14]That is so much better.
[112:28.76]Only Sith steal in absolute dicks.
[112:33.93]What?
[112:37.69]What are you talking about?
[112:42.19]The light is almost here.
[112:44.47]Woo!
[112:45.69]Oh.
[112:49.47]Comboed.
[112:53.77]Alright, we're good.
[112:55.59]Getting overwhelmed.
[113:05.84]Getting overwhelmed.
[113:15.90]Ugh.
[113:21.13]Come on, she's gonna make it, right?
[113:25.14]We're almost there.
[113:31.96]You gotta stay alive.
[113:32.70]I need at least one person to stay alive with me.
[113:54.51]I think she died in here.
[113:55.21]What does the horn thing do?
[114:06.02]It's not clear how to use this artifact.
[114:07.58]No, but it does.
[114:09.20]Research reveals nothing.
[114:18.80]She made it out.
[114:24.84]You would have needed such a good computer for this in 1999.
[114:26.92]Yeah.
[114:27.36]A lot of cutscenes, too.
[114:35.01]In the chaos following the escape, I lost my companions.
[114:38.77]Oh.
[114:39.11]There was nothing to do but hope that they would eventually return to the White Tower.
[114:43.49]The trip back was long and difficult, especially alone and guarding the Ammerlands Tir Angrial.
[114:49.67]It took fully three weeks to arrive home.
[114:52.74]I was greeted by Tar Valon, the city surrounding the White Tower, in ruins.
[114:58.26]Nothing less than an army could have caused this.
[115:00.82]But what army?
[115:01.74]I was going to read the books, but after this, nah.
[115:03.88]I scanned for the White Tower, hoping against hope that it still stood.
[115:08.04]Thank the light it did.
[115:08.86]You should be more inclined to read the books after this.
[115:10.46]But besieged by countless Trollocs and Murdral.
[115:12.97]That told me some, but clearly my answers lay inside.
[115:16.43]I decided to sneak in.
[115:22.27]The books are great, unlike this mid game.
[115:29.89]I don't think this game is mid, I think this game is sick.
[115:37.07]Did I just sprint by everybody?
[115:39.81]Here you are.
[115:40.91]I was beginning to worry.
[115:42.09]Omerlin?
[115:48.19]What are you doing in the Omerlin's chamber?
[115:50.74]Uh-huh.
[115:50.90]Uh-oh.
[115:51.02]What was that?
[116:13.25]Keeper Elena, it is wonderful to see you alive.
[116:16.89]Why'd she just do that?
[116:17.71]I had my doubts about whether you'd return.
[116:19.95]Naturally, the situation here is quite distressing, but I expect you to remember that you are addressing a sitter of the hall.
[116:29.38]I require a certain amount of decorum.
[116:35.30]Of course, Sitter Sephiram.
[116:37.84]If you would be so kind, could you explain your presence here?
[116:41.72]That's what I'm saying.
[116:47.20]As you wish, Keeper.
[116:49.94]Shortly after the Dark One's army arrived in Tar-Valon, the Amaryllin called to council.
[116:55.84]She announced that she was giving control of the Tower's defense to Rizlin of the Blue, but only to hold until you return when she should defer to the Keeper.
[117:04.97]In the argument that followed, the Amaryllin seat disappeared.
[117:08.54]Not just from the council chamber, but from the tower, it seems.
[117:11.76]I feel like I had her hair for the last year.
[117:16.77]Rizlin has done an admirable job given her experience, but it's clear, even to her, that the hall should hold the responsibility of the tower's defense.
[117:28.30]When asked, Rizlin immediately handed over command.
[117:32.54]To that end, I've been searching for the tower's seals.
[117:36.52]To defend against the invaders, of course.
[117:38.86]The seals are the responsibility of the Amaryllis.
[117:41.92]You have no right to ransack her chambers.
[117:44.84]You have no claim to them.
[117:46.44]Where is the Amaryllis keeper?
[117:49.50]She cannot defend the seals if she is not here.
[117:53.36]We have reason to believe that the seals are what the invaders search for.
[117:57.80]I will keep this one safe, since I haven't run away from the danger like a coward.
[118:09.35]But I am here, sitter.
[118:12.07]And I've been given command of the tower by order of the Ammerlin Seat.
[118:17.34]Thank you for holding the seal for me.
[118:20.02]I'll see that it remains safe.
[118:28.16]Thank you.
[118:31.70]There's a giant fireplace.
[118:41.19]A big hearth like that?
[118:42.79]The invaders have broken through the front gate and turned the white tower into a battlefield.
[118:46.67]I would love to stand in front of one of those.
[118:50.45]The remaining warders and sisters have tried valiantly to defend the tower, but they are outnumbered.
[118:55.05]And while the gate lies open, Trollocs and Murdral stream inside to replace their dead.
[119:00.36]Although the outer gate may have been breached, there is an inner gate.
[119:04.04]If I can reach and close it, we may have a chance to destroy... Okay, so we're under attack.
[119:06.94]The main gate is not near.
[119:08.96]Located at the base of an adjoining tower, the bridges to this tower extend from the gallery.
[119:14.16]Fight your way through the library and get to the gallery, then cross to the other tower.
[119:20.77]Oh, hell yeah.
[119:21.29]I will do as you say.
[119:25.93]I will guard the gate.
[119:35.75]Somebody said, you good?
[119:39.84]Good to see you.
[119:42.94]We got a lot of troops here.
[119:50.39]Coming up on a break here.
[119:51.29]I'm gonna take it in a minute.
[119:55.05]I wish I could get a sword.
[119:56.59]Chain landing is awful.
[119:59.23]This one's amazing.
[120:01.12]Dart is amazing.
[120:03.22]Shield is amazing.
[120:06.05]What is this one?
[120:08.63]Personal Illusion.
[120:10.27]Weaves your image before you, an ethereal copy of you, and leaves it there to fool others.
[120:15.73]Okay, so it's just a... It's like a target dummy.
[120:20.20]Still don't know what this thing does.
[120:25.22]I can't even use it.
[120:25.84]Are you pledging your sword to me?
[120:36.17]Let's go.
[120:36.57]Sister.
[120:40.07]I'm over here.
[120:43.59]Sister.
[120:44.29]You alright?
[120:44.90]Alright, well, whatever.
[120:46.48]I am watching for intruders.
[120:49.24]This place is huge.
[121:00.13]There's not a door?
[121:00.85]Sister.
[121:02.97]Sister.
[121:04.57]Sister.
[121:16.81]Who killed him?
[121:22.67]Oh my god, this person has magic.
[121:27.12]Alright, I'll be back.
[121:29.44]See you guys in like three or four minutes.
[121:47.84]Somebody said fried egg.
[121:49.91]Jerma would not do this.
[121:51.37]What does that mean?
[121:51.95]Fried egg.
[121:55.65]Fried egg.
[121:56.25]I don't get it.
[121:56.75]What does that mean?
[122:00.46]I've seen that like five or six times over the last two hours.
[122:03.16]I don't get it.
[122:05.77]Alright, right back.
[125:27.09]have returned and I'm ready I'm gonna play this like another 30 40 minutes and then I want to try uh wacky races wacky racers or whatever
[125:57.38]Wacky race?
[125:58.18]Yeah, wacky racers.
[126:04.14]That sounds too wacky.
[126:08.63]Alright, let's go.
[126:10.17]Welcome back.
[126:10.57]Alright, so we have to defend the tower.
[126:14.41]I have to get through the library.
[126:16.27]So I gotta make sure I save it.
[126:20.99]Let's go.
[126:23.44]Whoa.
[126:24.18]Whoa.
[126:31.22]Where are they?
[126:32.60]I don't like this friendly fire.
[126:37.90]Nice.
[126:41.54]Okay, good.
[126:42.12]Let's keep going.
[126:43.45]Can you go that way?
[126:56.21]Triple.
[126:58.34]I'm coming.
[127:00.06]No, I'm not.
[127:00.84]Good luck.
[127:13.74]I played way too much Soldier on Team Fortress.
[127:15.79]I'm just trying to shoot them where their feet are about to be.
[127:24.69]What's that?
[127:26.78]Is that an item?
[127:27.54]I think it's just a magic lamp.
[127:32.98]What?
[127:33.92]Where?
[127:41.65]I think this is... Okay, you have it under control?
[127:49.05]I'm being very unhelpful.
[127:53.98]That sounded like a gun.
[128:08.24]Okay.
[128:09.76]Somebody's already got this completely under control.
[128:11.24]Oh!
[128:13.72]What the hell was that?
[128:20.49]It just exploded.
[128:28.83]Okay, what is this end delay route or whatever?
[128:45.71]Lightning tech is not bad.
[128:50.91]Lightning felt kind of terrible.
[128:52.81]Okay, I don't want to go this way.
[129:00.81]Where do I want to go?
[129:08.19]Oh, hold on.
[129:14.04]There we go.
[129:19.37]Oh no, that was too late.
[129:23.12]It was already an intense fight here.
[129:30.40]The whole battle already happened.
[129:32.09]It happened in five seconds.
[129:34.33]I just wasn't around for it.
[129:41.74]How do I get the hell out of here?
[129:53.45]You've been going around in a circle?
[129:54.95]Yeah, I know, but where... How do I get out of the circle?
[130:04.05]I gotta go up.
[130:04.93]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[130:14.03]Where's that staircase to go up?
[130:15.65]Not this one.
[130:16.07]Wait, can I... I can't jump from here.
[130:17.49]I tried that already.
[130:22.29]Is it over?
[130:22.69]It's right here.
[130:23.25]Up here?
[130:24.55]Then go up again.
[130:25.45]But how do I go up again?
[130:26.33]Alright, let's try this way.
[130:29.45]I guess maybe I'll just jump.
[130:31.91]Whoa!
[130:33.75]Why was that armed?
[130:35.91]Why was it armed?
[130:41.73]That was awful.
[130:42.51]No!
[130:43.45]Ugh.
[130:55.76]Explosive ward?
[130:59.40]As long as you are looking directly at a flat surface, activating the effects is a ward.
[131:03.68]Walking... Oh, it's a... Okay.
[131:07.47]It's a mine.
[131:07.85]So I'll put this down and... Turn the lights off.
[131:29.23]Come on.
[131:38.13]He's still alive, he's still alive.
[131:59.25]You piece of shit.
[132:00.05]Just walk on it so I don't... Oh my god.
[132:08.52]Fuck you.
[132:15.16]How do you still get away?
[132:25.35]Ugh.
[132:30.78]That's not gonna end that way.
[132:42.10]Nice jump!
[132:43.94]Damn!
[133:06.88]Yeah, good luck with that one.
[133:08.67]Where you going, huh?
[133:09.71]Where you going?
[133:11.89]Oh my fucking god, it's chasing me!
[133:14.13]What the fuck?
[133:15.55]What?
[133:16.01]Where'd he go?
[133:27.86]This is fucked up.
[133:29.98]This game is crazy.
[133:38.98]I don't even know what that spell even did.
[133:53.07]Keep the darts out.
[133:53.69]Alright, now I know what that means.
[133:58.97]What if I just say, who cares?
[134:13.62]Who's doing that?
[134:19.14]Swap places and then find target.
[134:23.38]Alright, swap places with this guy.
[134:35.66]I would love to see this guy.
[134:47.03]Is he okay?
[134:50.40]Yeah, right.
[134:51.36]Yeah, right.
[134:57.56]Oh, that doesn't look right.
[135:03.14]Was I not supposed to do this?
[135:22.80]I want him to blow up.
[135:24.62]Oh, fine.
[135:33.11]Now it's an obstacle for me.
[135:35.35]Wonderful.
[135:42.74]You play Dark Cloud?
[135:44.38]No, but I heard it was really good.
[135:45.38]I heard it's very fun.
[135:53.48]Wait, can I open this by... No.
[135:59.62]Wait, let's... Just out of curiosity.
[136:14.41]Okay.
[136:18.53]Oh my goodness.
[136:22.68]Yikes.
[136:24.04]That was crunchy.
[136:27.40]That was a long fall.
[136:34.10]I know.
[136:34.42]Maybe I shouldn't blow this up.
[136:41.07]Come on up.
[136:58.58]Get up here!
[136:59.02]He's still alive!
[137:16.16]I wanted to jump off the edge so bad.
[137:20.72]Where are you going?
[137:28.70]What a fucking idiot.
[137:45.77]Assist from the door?
[137:46.67]Those guys are actually really... Oh shit, I'm out of spells.
[138:06.41]Where?
[138:07.23]Oh shit, hold on.
[138:18.70]I put way too many down.
[138:36.98]Oh, are you still alive?
[138:39.98]That was... That was... So much explosion, man.
[139:21.37]Oh no.
[139:23.34]Another wizard dead.
[139:24.62]Turn the music up.
[139:51.65]These things are so good.
[139:52.53]I need... I need shift places.
[140:05.64]Or... No, no, no.
[140:06.32]Whatever it's called.
[140:07.10]You know the one.
[140:07.48]The one where you dash forward.
[140:11.34]Alright.
[140:11.64]I'll turn it up.
[140:12.24]Fine.
[140:20.62]There.
[140:28.81]This is rigged to explode.
[140:41.83]Oh shit.
[140:43.65]Wait, that's a good thing.
[140:48.13]Fire shield.
[140:51.36]Whirlwind all this is going to be awesome.
[140:54.00]OK, key to the gallery.
[140:59.56]There's so much stuff in here.
[141:00.48]How do I get out of here?
[141:10.13]What the fuck just happened?
[141:30.36]Those are all fireworks.
[141:35.01]I'm good.
[141:35.59]I'm good.
[141:36.29]Alright, I got the key.
[141:46.92]Nice.
[141:47.58]Alright, what else is in here?
[141:48.50]Alright, I gotta go all the way back.
[142:15.31]Okay, these explode.
[142:16.63]What you gonna do?
[142:20.54]Come on.
[142:25.68]You gonna jump?
[142:27.42]Why don't you jump?
[142:30.44]I'm right here.
[142:30.84]You can jump right into me.
[142:32.99]Dumbass.
[142:42.58]Okay, climb the tower.
[142:44.29]This is going to be a nightmare.
[142:45.21]This is going to be a nightmare.
[142:50.37]Let's put on fire shield.
[142:53.39]I want to try whirlwind.
[143:01.76]What?
[143:04.80]Turn around!
[143:12.35]That's a great team.
[143:13.47]That's a good team.
[143:14.39]ICC.
[143:15.07]You do the DPS.
[143:21.50]Except it doesn't help if you get stuck in the door.
[143:23.54]It would be more helpful.
[143:24.78]Turn around and fight, please.
[143:27.28]Fight this one.
[143:33.17]Get him.
[143:33.51]He's a free kill.
[143:34.61]Stab him.
[143:38.29]This guy's going to puke.
[143:47.34]Nice.
[143:47.58]Okay, good.
[143:50.00]Items in here.
[143:50.50]Are we good?
[143:52.18]Yep.
[143:52.72]Give me more tornado.
[144:01.83]Oops, sorry.
[144:13.05]Get him.
[144:15.99]Focus on one.
[144:28.44]OK, let's go.
[144:37.22]You good?
[144:40.70]Alright, I brought her back to life.
[144:47.74]Are you?
[144:53.34]Let's go.
[144:55.18]Come on, with me.
[144:57.42]With me!
[145:00.96]With me, let's go.
[145:07.98]You alright?
[145:08.30]Is that you?
[145:22.17]Look, it's me!
[145:29.27]That's too risky.
[145:49.46]I'm not doing it.
[145:57.18]That was dumb.
[145:59.51]I'm good.
[146:00.29]Alright, I made it.
[146:06.78]This is the next tower we had to go to.
[146:07.98]Any more helpers?
[146:22.15]Looking for helpers.
[146:22.89]Any more helpers in here?
[146:45.40]Is somebody behind me?
[146:47.92]Oh shit, just get out.
[146:58.39]Alright, that's actually- Yeah!
[147:01.43]Okay.
[147:14.68]No!
[147:16.19]What the fuck am I doing?
[147:17.39]Where's the- I don't know, last time I saved- Why did I go after him?
[147:27.36]I'm an idiot!
[147:28.56]It's okay, it's right here.
[147:44.46]I'll do it quick this time, don't worry.
[147:50.80]This thing sucks!
[148:27.37]That didn't even kill him!
[148:28.37]Okay.
[148:46.12]Wait, I gotta drop him further.
[148:49.96]Oh god, come on.
[148:57.02]Is that even hurting them?
[149:03.19]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[149:05.59]I'm going back to the beginning.
[149:06.61]I don't care.
[150:08.97]Eat shit.
[151:13.22]I actually followed him the whole way.
[151:20.71]No, this is not efficient.
[151:21.77]Oh, he exploded.
[151:41.63]He exploded.
[151:51.10]Is he too heavy?
[151:57.76]Wow, nice recovery, dude.
[152:04.44]Honestly?
[152:07.14]This is kind of annoying.
[152:36.86]Now we're good.
[152:42.34]Okay.
[152:44.34]Everybody relax.
[152:46.10]We're getting through it.
[152:47.30]Everything's going just... Alright, I got darts.
[152:55.65]It's my bread and butter.
[153:00.81]I wish I could trade.
[153:01.35]Trade?
[153:05.17]I got destroyed.
[153:05.97]I wish I could trade everything for darts.
[153:23.02]That dude, yeah, that dude was messed up.
[153:26.94]Items.
[153:29.88]Yeah, thank God for the darts.
[153:33.69]Okay, keep going.
[153:45.30]What's the boss in this one going to be?
[153:50.52]What the hell is that?
[154:06.28]God.
[154:07.94]OK, OK, OK, hold on.
[154:11.02]Reflex spell.
[154:13.14]Why is he running at me now?
[154:14.25]He's supposed to be casting spells.
[154:15.35]Why are they running at me?
[154:19.66]He's supposed to be a mage.
[154:43.62]Come on!
[154:44.20]This is the worst spell in the whole game.
[155:05.62]The guy was peeking, but I got him.
[155:23.76]What the hell?
[155:31.60]Where are these guys all coming from?
[155:33.09]What the fuck is going on?
[155:50.93]Are they all dead?
[155:51.75]Dude, a 420 stream would go so hard.
[156:00.15]I won't be live tomorrow.
[156:06.96]Oh, this looks like a boss room.
[156:08.42]Alright, I gotta get ready.
[156:12.86]I'm gonna put a... Okay, I gotta be ready.
[156:16.67]Put down an illusion.
[156:24.11]No.
[156:25.87]OK.
[156:28.57]I guess I'm good.
[156:29.17]What the hell is that?
[156:44.94]OK, we're good.
[156:47.10]What do these things do?
[156:52.64]You gonna be smoking weed tonight?
[156:54.65]Oh, no, probably not.
[156:56.55]Probably not.
[157:03.17]These things heal you?
[157:10.98]Okay, I need swap places.
[157:12.00]I did not expect me to have this many bombs.
[157:28.25]Alright, darts.
[157:36.62]Best spell in the game.
[157:38.50]Hands down.
[157:42.32]Alright, I think I got everything.
[157:51.77]What do I have to do?
[157:54.75]Is there like a interact or something?
[158:04.67]Oh OK.
[158:08.79]I think I did something.
[158:22.12]I was at buying this game right now.
[158:33.64]The one time electricity is going to be useful.
[158:37.82]OK, that was almost a whole magazine.
[158:44.75]That was almost a whole clip of electricity and he didn't even know.
[159:08.47]Watch the rafters.
[159:10.37]Yeah.
[159:11.17]Oh, I gotta make myself freeze.
[159:43.52]We start with this fucking bug money shit!
[159:49.66]Oh my god, freeze!
[159:51.08]Oh my god!
[159:51.80]Okay, what do I do?
[159:52.88]Heal.
[160:15.05]Whew!
[160:16.51]That spell is good!
[160:17.31]Alright, this door's locked.
[160:20.72]Okay.
[160:33.38]I'm in trouble?
[160:34.02]I have no heal.
[160:34.80]I got no heals.
[160:36.43]Go back and heal, but by the Andy roots?
[160:39.37]I can't go back.
[160:50.77]Okay.
[160:52.32]39 HP is not enough.
[160:57.44]I have no darts.
[160:58.28]I've got nothing.
[160:59.28]All I have is these shit spells that nobody wants to use.
[161:01.18]I gotta make it work.
[161:06.02]Alright, thank goodness.
[161:06.64]Alright, I gotta play really cautious because I don't really have anything.
[161:11.62]And I'm taking this game very seriously.
[161:12.91]You bet your ass I am.
[161:19.45]That's one seal.
[161:20.29]I need a key to get in this one.
[161:28.06]This won't open.
[161:29.78]It does open.
[161:30.30]I'm currently reading the series.
[161:38.20]I'm about to finish book 11.
[161:40.56]So you know what's going on.
[161:52.29]I knew it.
[161:57.13]These tight little corridors, I cannot do an explosion.
[162:01.37]This game is kind of hard.
[162:10.49]This game is fun.
[162:11.47]I like it.
[162:15.80]It's just a mess, but it's perfect.
[162:21.73]It's equal parts boomer shooter, equal parts stupid goofy game, and then... One of us is going to fuck up, and it's not going to be me.
[162:41.76]He hit me in the face with that.
[162:50.42]How are you still alive?
[162:54.58]Honestly.
[162:55.00]I'm going to have to do this.
[163:07.20]That face.
[163:08.00]Die!
[163:08.18]No!
[163:25.25]This is not good.
[163:26.27]I'm not sure I want to save it here.
[163:34.55]That's very good.
[163:36.63]Exactly what I need.
[163:37.37]What should I do?
[163:45.62]Should I go down?
[163:48.58]I think this is going to kill me.
[164:05.03]Oh, those are the things I need.
[164:06.35]I'm glad I exploded.
[164:12.95]Oh, thank goodness.
[164:28.18]Alright, but I... I didn't get everything, did I?
[164:33.66]I need to open that other seal.
[164:34.72]Is there anything else?
[164:43.60]There's got to be some other heal I can get, right?
[165:01.02]I gotta hit that lever.
[165:02.04]How do I get over there?
[165:02.74]People are getting killed by something.
[165:11.51]How do I get over there?
[165:12.35]Can I jump over there?
[165:14.93]Oh, there we go.
[165:16.17]Okay, I can get over there.
[165:26.50]We get keys to the gate.
[165:29.16]Nice.
[165:29.36]Nice.
[165:32.48]I want those items, though.
[165:35.16]Otherwise, I am dead.
[165:41.71]Shield is good, but that's not what I want.
[165:47.47]Damn it.
[165:47.90]How do I get over there?
[165:50.44]Can you freeze the fire?
[165:51.90]I don't think so.
[166:02.51]No, unfortunate.
[166:04.15]You need to jump there.
[166:05.09]Ooh, okay.
[166:11.72]Am I even on the right side?
[166:17.00]Oh, I... Huh.
[166:25.43]Huh.
[166:33.80]Well, I got the key.
[166:34.50]Whatever, I'm leaving.
[166:35.18]Oh, it's right here.
[166:43.53]Alright, that does that.
[166:49.73]Somebody's dying up here.
[167:09.91]I can go down.
[167:12.85]Nice.
[167:13.69]Cutscene.
[167:19.92]What am I doing here?
[167:35.85]Looks like a good coaster.
[167:42.13]The ancient Pepsi symbol.
[167:48.81]Drugs?
[167:49.15]Yeah, she's got a stash of, uh... Something.
[167:52.23]Looks like bread.
[167:54.19]To be honest, I would be- I would hide good bread like that.
[167:57.79]You're in a house- You got a household with a bunch of fuckfaces?
[168:00.39]Nah, I'm hiding good bread like that.
[168:01.75]Good fresh bakery bread?
[168:02.98]No.
[168:03.26]Ain't nobody gonna know what that is but me.
[168:06.38]Elena, Keeper of the Chronicles.
[168:08.62]The light send that your eyes find this message.
[168:11.70]I regret my absence at your return, but the Dark Ones' attack, both from outside and in, has forced me to ignore the Tower's defense in favor of the safety of our most sacred charge, the Quendalar Seals.
[168:25.24]I can trust no one.
[168:27.02]Sitter Sephiroth has gathered her forces and expelled those who could threaten her power.
[168:31.85]I fear the entire hall has fallen.
[168:35.51]As you know, only one seal can be carried at a time.
[168:39.21]Of the towers, too, I was forced to leave one concealed in my chambers.
[168:44.00]The other I brought to an ancient vault hidden in the basements of the tower.
[168:48.34]The safest place possible.
[168:50.46]I need you to come with all speed.
[168:52.80]These Tirangrial should lead you safely to me.
[168:56.17]Go to the deepest basement and invoke the Tracer.
[168:59.47]The artifact's power will reveal the trail to the closest seal, which will lead to the concealed entrance of the vault.
[169:06.64]From there, the way is riddled with traps.
[169:10.00]Detect traps will alert you to the most devious.
[169:13.70]I feel like you're serious.
[169:16.80]I can only hope that you've been successful in regaining what was stolen.
[169:21.01]If ever the tower needed that Tyr Angrial, it is now.
[169:31.52]I gotta burn the note, right?
[169:35.32]Don't do that.
[169:36.82]Don't do that!
[169:37.84]That's an ancient artifact!
[169:39.04]Oh my god!
[169:42.64]You don't want that to go into the museum after you defeat the evil?
[169:46.23]Put it in glass?
[169:47.01]What are you, crazy?
[170:01.48]What have we gained with this alliance?
[170:04.58]As soon as Ishmael started giving us orders, everything went wrong.
[170:08.71]We were doing fine alone.
[170:10.57]Soon the tower would have been ours.
[170:12.95]Ishmael is bringing it down around our heads.
[170:15.89]We brought his stooge into the tower as he commanded.
[170:19.00]We emptied the tower to search for this assassin as he commanded.
[170:23.74]Then with our forces spread throughout the countryside, he sends his army through the way gate to destroy us.
[170:30.00]If it weren't for that troublesome brown keeper of ours, he would have succeeded.
[170:34.03]Thank the light that our home guard is returning as we speak.
[170:37.71]But didn't this guy die?
[170:38.41]Who knows when Ishmael may attack again.
[170:41.33]If the Forsaken has his way, there won't be a tower to rule.
[170:47.09]You are... unhappy?
[170:53.48]This guy died in the treasure room.
[171:00.37]Oh, shit.
[171:00.91]He's got laser powers now.
[171:01.73]You misunderstand your places.
[171:04.05]Your reward is not the rule of this pitiful tower.
[171:07.71]Your reward is to serve Ishmael without hesitation, without question.
[171:12.91]If he were here instead of me, if he had heard your words, you would all be dead.
[171:18.64]Or worse.
[171:19.66]From what I see, you now have command of the tower, Sephiram.
[171:23.09]Do you think he'd relax if he drank a Coca Cola?
[171:39.32]It seems that the first disappeared with the Amaryllis seat.
[171:42.14]We suspect she is still within the tower, but we have been unable to find her.
[171:46.24]The second is currently in the possession of the Keeper.
[171:49.12]This is your tower!
[171:50.70]How far back do you have to go in history to prevent any conflict with, like, a Pepsi?
[171:54.54]You know what I mean?
[171:55.28]Like, back in, like, the, like, the, like, 1000 PC.
[171:57.65]Ishmael wants those seals.
[171:59.15]This should have been a simple collection.
[172:01.57]Your incompetence has compromised everything.
[172:04.63]Find the Amaryllis.
[172:06.63]Find the Keeper.
[172:08.25]Pepsi would start a war?
[172:09.19]I'm talking about if you went back to like 100 AD.
[172:25.68]and you had like a fresh ice cold Coca-Cola and you gave it to the king and you were like, stop all conflict and you can have this.
[172:31.70]He might be like, holy shit.
[172:33.48]What is this stuff?
[172:34.36]Whoa.
[172:34.54]This magical liquid.
[172:35.12]I'll do anything.
[172:35.96]We'll do anything.
[172:37.40]The elixir of life.
[172:38.36]He would invade to get it.
[172:54.55]Oh, no.
[172:55.65]Oh, no, that's not good.
[172:56.97]Yeah, he might be like, what are the ingredients of this?
[173:00.35]Tell me so I can invade every country that makes it.
[173:03.61]Ah, never mind.
[173:04.27]That wouldn't work.
[173:08.71]Yeah, that wouldn't work.
[173:16.23]They would probably hate it.
[173:18.46]There was no ice back then?
[173:19.68]No, I'm talking you go back with a nice... Yeah, you bring it back.
[173:23.79]The time portal opens.
[173:25.77]And you're about to go into 200 AD.
[173:29.30]And you're going to the throne room.
[173:30.40]There's a guy sitting there, and he's like, what is that appearing before us?
[173:34.17]And you go to your fridge.
[173:35.73]You get a nice frosted glass.
[173:37.79]Put a bunch of good bullet ice in it.
[173:39.61]Good bullet ice.
[173:40.37]Not like any of the bullshit.
[173:41.41]I'm talking good, clear, distilled water bullet ice.
[173:46.00]Pour a Coke over it.
[173:47.64]Get it nice and fizzy.
[173:48.96]Throw a straw in it.
[173:50.12]Walk in there and be like, King!
[173:53.44]Hold your men!
[173:56.29]I present to you an elixir of the gods.
[174:00.05]If he took a sip out of that, I feel like he'd do whatever you told him to.
[174:05.17]You could probably just change the course of all history.
[174:08.33]If you, uh... If you brought back, like, an ice cold Coca-Cola to, like, 40 AD.
[174:17.18]He would think it's poisoned?
[174:18.08]No, no, no, he would have, like, the poison guy drink it first.
[174:22.05]the poison tester would walk up, take a sip, and then probably go gall them, and just try to snatch it out of your hands, and then they'd kill him.
[174:28.31]And then he would know, wow, what is this?
[174:29.93]And then he would want to try some.
[174:39.18]If this ad shows up on TV, are you gonna... Yeah, this could be like a, this could be a Super Bowl ad.
[174:47.32]The king will be a celebrity.
[174:52.77]Yeah, the king will be Eugene Levy.
[174:55.18]Yeah.
[174:56.54]Oh.
[174:57.08]Okay, this could happen.
[175:07.44]This already was.
[175:09.49]No.
[175:12.67]You need to trademark that right now.
[175:13.91]Alright, so we need to...
[175:16.36]What do we got here?
[175:17.26]Invoke Tracer to discover the entrance to the vault.
[175:21.07]This is a lot of bullshit.
[175:22.45]Just walk around and throw shit at people.
[175:24.67]That's all I heard.
[175:25.25]Oops.
[175:36.91]I think this is a find it.
[175:38.29]Yeah, I gotta find it.
[175:39.06]What's that?
[175:46.02]That's the Bud Light Knight.
[175:49.68]Wait, does it- Okay, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[175:52.24]Does the Bud Light Knight go back in time and give a Bud Light to the king, and the king goes, Oh, frosty!
[175:58.57]And then- Wait, does this happen but with Bud Light?
[176:05.13]Yes, this actually happens?
[176:07.71]No way.
[176:08.31]Hold on a second.
[176:09.43]This is important.
[176:10.63]I need to see.
[176:12.89]So you mean to tell me there's a Bud Light Night commercial?
[176:15.22]Where this actually, where this happens?
[176:17.22]I'm looking it up right now.
[176:26.75]Commercial Bud the Bud Night.
[176:40.28]okay this is for the kid this is it right here bud night this is quality 360p that is not high quality
[177:07.96]This doesn't happen.
[177:15.74]This is not even close.
[177:23.23]No, this is not even close.
[177:29.87]They did the look there's a convenience store in the medieval times joke.
[177:35.99]No, no, I'm sorry.
[177:37.15]I'm sorry.
[177:39.11]Absolutely not even close.
[177:40.49]Not even close.
[177:41.23]Not even close.
[178:06.03]Sorry, guys.
[178:06.71]This hasn't happened yet.
[178:12.72]Hold on.
[178:12.94]Wait.
[178:13.22]It looked like there was another one.
[178:17.16]Wait, there's another one.
[178:17.76]This is a Game of Thrones one?
[178:22.72]How many are there?
[178:24.04]There's so many of these!
[178:28.70]There's ten minutes of Bud Knight ads!
[178:38.51]They did a crossover episode?
[178:42.86]There's a crossover episode with the Bud Knight and Tide.
[178:46.22]Oh, he got too popular.
[178:50.04]Oh, he got, he went, he went corporate.
[179:03.48]Yeah, he went corporate.
[179:04.60]Okay, so he got really popular then went corporate.
[179:09.24]There's like 15 of these.
[179:10.34]Okay, well anyways, apparently there was a Bud Knight that did this, but not with Pepsi or Coke.
[179:40.97]But with Bud Light, apparently?
[179:43.03]It's still not close to what I said.
[179:57.53]By the way, I don't endorse any alcohol.
[179:59.49]No alcohol is being endorsed on this stream at all.
[180:03.04]I was merely showing, showcasing what a story beat that I was thinking of.
[180:09.06]I don't endorse any alcohol in this stream, absolutely not.
[180:33.93]Show the weed night commercial?
[180:36.85]There is no such thing.
[180:48.37]Oh, okay.
[180:48.73]I have to follow this.
[180:49.45]I can't go this way.
[181:17.36]Is it behind the boxes?
[181:18.50]I can't seem to move them.
[181:24.47]Maybe that way?
[181:34.54]Fireball?
[181:35.04]I don't have any fireballs.
[181:37.42]Alright, well, it doesn't matter.
[181:39.74]This was a really fun one.
[181:40.64]This is great.
[181:42.44]But I'm going to take a break.
[181:43.16]We're going to come back and go play Wacky Racers.
[181:45.96]And we'll go from there.
[181:47.16]Maybe like another half an hour, hour.
[181:51.02]This is the Wheel of Time.
[182:01.63]You already played this.
[182:04.03]We're going to play it again.
[182:07.96]Have your back.
[183:00.57]By the way, the name of this game is called Wacky Wheels, not Wacky Racers.
[183:06.93]Just want to clarify.
[183:12.52]Be right back.
