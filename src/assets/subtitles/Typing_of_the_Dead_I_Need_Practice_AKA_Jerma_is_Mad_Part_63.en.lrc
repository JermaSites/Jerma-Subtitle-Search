[00:09.29]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:10.97]Jerma here.
[00:12.11]I apologize.
[00:12.85]I'm currently eating some Halloween candy because it's Halloween.
[00:17.17]And what better way to celebrate Halloween than to play, you know, Cipher and the Jedi Overkill.
[00:21.83]It just came out on Steam.
[00:24.15]So a couple things you- What's up, motherfucker?
[00:27.55]They met as adversaries.
[00:29.55]What the fuck was that for?
[00:31.45]A monster made them allies.
[00:34.65]So, The Typing of the Dead, as you can see, is a game about writing on your keyboard.
[00:40.61]You can only kill monsters if you type.
[00:42.85]You can't- there is no, like, shooty gun thing.
[00:45.87]There is no weapons.
[00:48.77]It's only your keyboard.
[00:49.93]What the fuck is that?
[00:50.93]GUTERRARIO?
[00:52.25]I don't even know what that is!
[00:54.18]I'm such a bad typer too, guys, I apologize.
[00:56.04]I have to, like, look at my keyboard, I suck so bad.
[00:59.04]But yeah, this game came out a long time ago, and they just re-imagined it.
[01:07.60]God, I'm so bad.
[01:10.59]God, I'm terrible at typing.
[01:13.31]Hey, you know what, let's make a Typing of the Dead video on a guy who can't type for shit.
[01:17.95]That sounds like a good idea.
[01:22.50]In the difficulty, you can make it much harder than this.
[01:26.44]I can't believe I have to look down every single time at my keys.
[01:29.28]That is so bad.
[01:30.46]I'm such a terrible, terrible typer.
[01:33.14]Flabwagon.
[01:35.56]So I think there's gonna be co-op eventually on this game.
[01:38.25]But it's good to see they actually brought this series back.
[01:42.25]Cut em down.
[01:46.83]Phew!
[01:47.33]Okay, we got through the first room.
[01:49.07]Can I reload?
[01:50.37]I don't think reloading really matters.
[01:51.97]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[01:52.47]There's gonna be a couple.
[01:53.17]There's gonna be a few coming through this door.
[01:57.57]God!
[01:57.99]I'm sorry I'm not, like, talking.
[02:05.88]This takes all of my brain power to be able to do this.
[02:10.02]What?
[02:11.06]What happened to the words that were just already there?
[02:17.80]But, if you are looking for something to help... I can't talk!
[02:26.82]If you're looking for... Okay, can I have a two-second break?
[02:32.00]If you're looking for some way to help your typing out, this is probably the game to do it, because you get to kill zombies in the same time, right?
[02:38.52]The best back rubs.
[02:41.68]This is actually helping me.
[02:45.79]This is helping my typing, guys.
[02:49.49]I'm becoming a type master because of typing of the dead.
[02:52.61]Oh shit.
[02:59.11]Shit!
[02:59.75]Fuck you!
[03:00.43]I love how I thought this was a great idea to make a video on this when I can't even pay attention to even talking.
[03:07.96]I'm such a brain dead fuck.
[03:10.14]I have to like pay complete attention to my keyboard and like nothing else.
[03:15.45]Oh, am I making a video right now, or am I trying to use my 100% of my brain to play this video game?
[03:22.31]I'm not sure.
[03:27.19]Well, those are for extra points.
[03:28.19]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[03:29.01]Uh-oh.
[03:35.24]Oh, boy.
[03:35.86]Hot diggity dog.
[03:40.56]I like how it gives you the... If you make an incorrect keystroke, it's not just gonna, like, make... Hold, wait, hold your fire.
[03:50.01]Mutilate.
[03:51.97]Civilian rescued!
[03:52.69]5,000 points, dude!
[03:54.71]Are you kidding me?
[03:55.41]Rack it up!
[03:56.41]Rack up the points!
[04:01.01]Whose head is that?
[04:04.30]I am such an old person.
[04:09.20]I am like 75 years old right now.
[04:11.48]Alright, type C-A-Y-N-I-D.
[04:17.65]Some of you guys can probably blow through this, and I give you a lot of props, because typing has never been my forte.
[04:25.99]I've never been able to really do it that well.
[04:29.89]I have a legitimate headache.
[04:31.58]What is this?
[04:32.26]What is this acting?
[04:34.04]Boss fight!
[04:34.54]Oh, I have to hit I. Shit.
[04:49.94]Oh my, I'm getting owned.
[04:50.82]This guy is owning me.
[04:53.66]I'm getting hit by every single thing.
[04:55.80]No!
[04:56.26]No, Z!
[04:57.36]There we go.
[04:58.10]There we go.
[05:00.76]I'm about to rage quit this game.
[05:04.32]About to rage quit this game.
[05:06.22]I'm about to put my hand through my monitor.
[05:09.14]I'm about to seriously... There's gonna be some serious rage in a second.
[05:14.32]Because of how awful, and how stupid I am, and how... Give me a chance!
[05:22.76]Just give me the gun.
[05:25.85]I'll take the gun.
[05:36.83]What's going on?
[05:39.98]I think they just made it way easier for me, because the game could tell I was having a ton of trouble.
[05:45.46]Look, look at how easy these words are now.
[05:48.86]We could tell that you, like, sucked ass.
[05:51.10]We're gonna give you, like, some wicked easy words, like am and okay.
[05:56.44]Whatever it is, just shoot it.
[05:59.21]Hopefully that trend keeps up.
[06:00.31]Look, oh, Sam.
[06:01.81]Hog.
[06:03.21]Tap.
[06:04.47]And I still missed it.
[06:07.79]I still missed it.
[06:09.19]Oh, we're back to being difficult now.
[06:11.42]That's so funny.
[06:15.64]What was it?
[06:16.06]C?
[06:17.60]B?
[06:18.46]Homework?
[06:20.68]D, you missed me.
[06:23.63]I wish I could do some better commentary, guys, but it is mildly pathetic that my brain can't do two things at once.
[06:29.03]I'm gonna lose again.
[06:31.07]I'm gonna fucking lose again.
[06:34.93]Can I have the wicked simple easy words again?
[06:37.85]Give me, like, two fro-fat easy words.
[06:43.00]Come on, man.
[06:47.00]Lullaby.
[06:47.94]Done.
[06:48.76]I did it.
[06:49.08]I beat the first boss in the Typing of the Dead.
