[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.80]Hello.
[00:05.02]How are you doing?
[00:05.72]That's good to hear.
[00:10.82]I'm doing pretty good too.
[00:13.74]Just hanging out.
[00:16.15]Loving up the PS4.
[00:16.83]Gonna do something I've wanted to do for a while.
[00:24.09]And that's play Days Gone.
[00:27.93]I know the reviews aren't that great.
[00:30.83]It's not a 10 out of 10 experience.
[00:35.97]But we're going to just throw a whole day away.
[00:42.86]Pretty good title, I think.
[00:45.06]But, hope you're doing good.
[00:48.46]We're going to get started.
[00:49.26]I'll give you the rundown for this week.
[00:54.74]Yes, we are very early today.
[00:58.38]That's because we're going to be very early tomorrow, too.
[01:02.74]Back-to-back days starting somewhere before 1 or 2 o'clock.
[01:13.25]EU streams.
[01:18.43]Stop being so early.
[01:21.36]I can't help it.
[01:22.12]Sometimes I have to.
[01:24.86]But yeah, so what's going to happen here is...
[01:27.73]I wanted to play Days Gone.
[01:29.75]It's a new game.
[01:32.03]It's got motorcycles in it, so that's an automatic plus one ladder grid.
[01:36.96]It's open world, zombies.
[01:38.62]This might be terrible.
[01:39.42]This might be fun.
[01:41.12]I don't know.
[01:45.99]This could be the worst game I've ever played.
[01:48.77]I'm willing to give it a try.
[01:51.30]So we're gonna go today and tomorrow.
[01:54.06]If Days Gone is fun, then tomorrow we're gonna keep going.
[01:58.65]If Days Gone... We actually just wasted a whole day.
[02:03.29]Then I won't play it tomorrow.
[02:05.27]And we'll do something else tomorrow.
[02:07.05]Then, Saturday and Sunday is gonna be Sam & Max Season 2 Episode 3 and 4.
[02:13.04]And... And... MS DOS Night 2.
[02:19.74]Told you I was gonna make that a weekly thing.
[02:23.27]That is the plan for this week.
[02:31.14]Porn 2.
[02:33.62]It sucks, but you may enjoy it.
[02:35.37]I'm going in with an open mind.
[02:40.15]I doubt it'd be the worst game you've ever played.
[02:43.01]I don't think it will either.
[02:46.62]It's very bland.
[02:51.43]So this is what, like the tasteless sponge of video games?
[02:55.96]Isn't this like 50 hours long?
[03:07.06]It's very playable, alright.
[03:09.33]It's a 50- it's a coin flip if it's gonna be enjoyable or not, okay.
[03:14.89]Well, let's take that chance.
[03:20.48]Days Gone.
[03:23.40]Yeah, I'd like to tell you, you ain't getting this one back.
[03:28.30]I really hope at the end of this stream I don't say, I wish I could get this day back.
[03:34.66]But, let's go.
[03:36.08]Days Gone, we're gonna start it.
[03:41.00]And here it comes.
[03:47.34]Days Gone.
[03:48.85]Here comes the opening cutscene.
[03:52.57]days gone more like eat ass yeah I know right all right wait wait why is there no sound should there be sound right now this should be right what a waste of a day I already know it's why it's waste look is this a loading screen
[04:25.33]Why do we have like the Witcher 2 base game level of loading screen?
[04:31.35]No, this is like the original Witcher.
[04:37.53]Do you guys remember that shit?
[04:46.46]What is going on right now?
[04:52.16]It can't be this long.
[04:53.36]That's the initial load time, right?
[05:10.75]I have nothing to say.
[05:12.13]I have nothing to tell you.
[05:13.19]I don't have anything.
[05:15.63]It's just a long loading screen.
[05:17.08]That's it.
[05:17.54]That's all.
[05:17.86]I don't have anything else to say.
[05:19.00]This better be good.
[05:27.66]No, I already put a warning in the title.
[05:32.32]You've been pre-warned.
[05:37.82]This is kind of, uh... This is unbelievable, though.
[05:45.74]I have class soon.
[05:47.06]You may as well just go... You know what?
[05:49.18]If you got class soon, you may as well just go study.
[05:50.92]Like, extra study time.
[05:56.15]I can't hear anything.
[05:56.83]Alright, brightness.
[05:59.79]This one needs to be brightened.
[06:01.89]Set your brightness so that Days Gone is barely visible.
[06:06.39]Now, I always hate that shit.
[06:07.88]It's never correct.
[06:09.08]I'm gonna go with, like, 7.
[06:09.68]Can I turn HDR on or off?
[06:16.64]Can I not turn it on?
[06:19.18]I can't even turn it on!
[06:27.84]I cannot hear anything.
[06:29.10]Is it because this is too low?
[06:34.35]Playing on seven brightness.
[06:36.55]What do you mean?
[06:37.15]I need to be able to see.
[06:43.03]Nobody plays these games at like two brightness.
[06:45.61]You can't see anything.
[06:47.15]It's impossible to play.
[06:49.61]Oh, there it is.
[06:50.05]All right, let me turn this up on my end because this is like, this is, this is bait.
[06:59.79]You know what I mean?
[07:00.31]This is bait.
[07:02.13]Okay, now I can hear it.
[07:05.27]Press any button.
[07:07.39]Days gone.
[07:08.15]Welcome.
[07:08.57]Here comes the options menu.
[07:10.23]Controls.
[07:10.83]Display.
[07:12.17]Oh, alright.
[07:16.46]I'm staying at 7 brightness.
[07:17.76]Audio.
[07:20.18]I mean, I don't know.
[07:20.94]Who cares?
[07:23.12]Dialogue.
[07:23.78]Sound effects.
[07:24.38]We'll just keep everything normal.
[07:25.48]I don't like the music being the same.
[07:28.60]Gameplay.
[07:29.46]Difficulty.
[07:31.02]Put it on.
[07:31.32]Just keep it on.
[07:32.40]Wait, there is no heart.
[07:34.64]Guys, this is no hard, so you can't make fun of me this time.
[07:41.88]You can't make fun of me.
[07:44.75]Normal is hard.
[07:47.35]Vibration off.
[07:48.81]This ain't 1995.
[07:49.81]We're just going to keep it like that.
[07:54.25]What else is there?
[07:55.33]User interface.
[07:57.63]XP indicators are off.
[07:59.04]Well, whatever.
[08:01.28]We're gonna get an entire huge tutorial.
[08:03.60]We're gonna get like a four to five hour tutorial.
[08:09.14]This is my last chance here.
[08:11.58]This is it.
[08:11.96]This is my final chance to like do something else.
[08:16.36]No, I'm... I locked it in.
[08:30.87]Hope that wasn't a mistake.
[08:35.89]It's a good game.
[08:36.77]I know.
[08:37.03]Why am I sitting here going like, oh, this is my last chance.
[08:42.58]This is it.
[08:43.12]After this.
[08:45.00]It's a video game.
[08:46.78]Relax.
[09:00.59]This is not my audition for American Idol.
[09:03.34]I'm gonna be okay.
[09:04.42]Like, it's a game.
[09:05.02]I'm just gonna enjoy it.
[09:05.97]This is my one shot!
[09:13.82]Yeah, she's burning up.
[09:15.28]The knife must have nicked her kidney or something.
[09:17.56]She's turned into something.
[09:19.22]Knife?
[09:19.86]How you doing, little sister?
[09:21.46]So stupid.
[09:22.48]It's this little... This little kid that's... Yeah, what did he say?
[09:27.01]Little kid.
[09:28.21]We need subtitles.
[09:29.07]Shit.
[09:29.31]Come on.
[09:40.58]Hold on, I can't do this yet.
[09:44.22]Wait.
[09:46.70]Wait, we need help.
[09:47.58]She's been wounded.
[09:48.54]What?
[09:48.80]What's wrong with her?
[09:49.76]Well, she's not... Whatever the hell's going on out there.
[09:52.26]She's been stabbed.
[09:56.19]Come on, man.
[09:56.57]You're an astronaut.
[09:57.33]You should know what to do.
[09:58.75]If we don't get her to a hospital, she's going to die.
[10:01.61]There are no more hospitals.
[10:05.37]hospitals you got uh doctors you got triage you got a mass unit oh look I'm just a grad student okay I I got volunteers okay that's the party store astronaut costume we're overweight okay I can only take two of you two
[10:34.73]That's the guy that comes to the party in the astronaut costume that was like $14 at the party store.
[10:45.36]He's smoking a joint and he takes the helmet off and he's like, I'm ready to hit the moon!
[10:50.30]Go.
[10:59.63]This chopper's going down.
[11:32.09]A big ring.
[11:34.57]That's a huge ring.
[11:45.30]I want this ring back.
[11:49.15]It took me 25 Captain Crunch box tops to get this.
[11:53.39]Make sure you bring it back in one piece.
[12:08.93]Okay, let me put the subtitles on.
[12:28.17]There was plenty of space in the helicopter.
[12:42.75]Hello?
[12:52.07]Anytime a game spends this, I think the game's hung up.
[12:54.79]Like, it's hanging.
[12:55.51]That's pretty much what I was going for in Dreams the other day.
[13:08.76]They did a kind of a better job than I did, but, you know, you can't be perfect.
[13:17.16]Freaker is all dead.
[13:19.00]Zombies are called Freakers?
[13:23.09]Sounds like a YouTube sub... community.
[13:28.55]Uh, plus one letter grade.
[13:37.24]Shit, she's alive.
[13:47.12]Alvarez, Alvarez, hey, Alvarez, what happened here?
[13:51.66]I mean, who did this?
[13:53.60]Was it, was it Rippers?
[13:57.50]No, his community is really nice.
[14:01.37]It wasn't Rip Van Winkle 22.
[14:05.95]It was Freaker, Freaker HD 1080p.
[14:26.43]Here we go.
[14:27.63]Gameplay.
[14:30.15]Chase down Leon.
[14:31.67]How do I drive?
[14:33.69]They didn't tell me how to drive.
[14:35.51]X to boost.
[14:38.96]It's actually kind of hard to drive this.
[14:42.84]How many boosts do I get?
[14:47.42]Oh, it's the Broomers versus the Zoomers.
[14:51.89]No shit!
[14:52.91]Can't have much!
[14:59.28]Just drive through the fire, it doesn't even matter.
[15:01.04]I feel like I'm going too slow.
[15:18.69]Subtitles, subtitles, subtitles.
[15:20.09]Alright, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:22.74]Display.
[15:25.44]Why can I not turn this on?
[15:26.60]Why would you even have this setting here?
[15:27.84]This is probably for PS4 Pro only.
[15:31.70]Language.
[15:33.12]Subtitles.
[15:39.74]There, I turned them on.
[15:57.60]Jerma, come to Brazil!
[16:16.78]65 mph on this road?!
[16:20.42]He laid his bike down.
[16:24.69]When landing, you can reduce bike damage by using L to angle your tires parallel to the ground.
[16:28.25]Give you the next tip.
[16:29.57]If you drift while turning, you can slide through corners and even do donuts.
[16:32.11]Give you the next one.
[16:33.51]Boil on the bike.
[16:42.20]Watch the gas tank.
[16:44.30]Cover me.
[16:44.60]I'm right behind you.
[16:48.38]How do you cover somebody with a shotgun from that far away?
[16:51.06]You may as well just shoot it in the air.
[17:06.65]We'll make it quick.
[17:09.07]Tracking.
[17:09.73]Press R3 to activate survival vision, which will reveal clues and other information about your surroundings.
[17:18.84]Does every game have to have this?
[17:25.00]I'm sorry.
[17:25.48]I'm gonna have to take a second here to explain.
[17:29.84]Why does every fucking AAA game have a spider sense?
[17:33.46]Why?
[17:38.00]What is causing this guy to have this?
[17:43.32]Every game is Batman.
[17:44.50]Yeah, but, like, why?
[17:46.60]What's, like, the story purpose for him to be able to see through walls?
[17:55.95]Tracking.
[17:56.55]While using survival vision, your DualShock 4 wireless controller will vibrate.
[17:59.99]I turned off vibrate.
[18:02.18]When your camera's facing a clue, depending on your distance to it, vibrations will increase or decrease.
[18:06.68]But I turned them off.
[18:09.72]Hold on, hold on.
[18:12.90]Shit.
[18:14.98]Alright, let me see.
[18:15.64]Okay.
[18:22.01]Do I seriously have to turn on the vibration?
[18:28.59]No, what?
[18:29.59]They're behind us.
[18:35.50]I don't need the vibration.
[18:37.18]I'll just look.
[18:39.70]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:40.30]Here.
[18:41.36]Down this way.
[18:41.98]Wait, I can see into the past?
[18:47.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:48.23]Hold on.
[18:49.61]I touched the blood.
[18:50.39]Therefore, now I can see the past.
[18:53.77]Wait, there's a Dark Souls bloodstain here.
[18:55.35]Let me see what happened.
[18:57.16]Watch out, watch out.
[18:58.18]He died by something over here.
[19:05.98]did he die by I have no idea he fell and died I think he was doing the meme where he jumped off the top to die and made sure he had the blood get down
[19:33.92]There's blips on the map.
[19:35.32]Can I, like, investigate?
[19:37.04]How do I take out the gun?
[19:38.52]No, it doesn't say boomer.
[19:40.14]Press X to hop over parkour style.
[20:05.27]I mean, the environments look pretty cool.
[20:09.83]Who shot him, Joe?
[20:11.71]Did I shoot him?
[20:12.99]Bleeding out.
[20:17.13]That's a hell of a way to go.
[20:18.19]It's slow.
[20:18.97]A lot of pain, but I suppose you know about that.
[20:21.36]She was still breathing when we found her, you piece of shit.
[20:23.58]I wasn't going to waste a bullet not on her.
[20:26.36]I'm on it for a second.
[20:26.98]I'm on it for a second now.
[20:28.62]Where's the stash, Leon?
[20:31.58]You can tell us.
[20:33.50]Unlike you, I can promise you we'll make it quick.
[20:38.96]Those don't look like you've been suffering for too long.
[20:41.28]Leon, he got a little problem.
[20:44.64]Why would you do that?
[20:45.56]I can smell your blood all the way down here.
[20:48.42]Now they'll smell me, because I'm stupid enough to put my hands all in.
[20:51.68]I don't want to part.
[20:53.32]He's alive.
[20:55.24]I guess he's going to find out.
[20:56.48]Fuck you.
[20:57.65]Goodbye, Leon.
[20:58.79]No, wait.
[21:01.16]Smears blood all over it with his hands.
[21:03.56]Is he a bad guy?
[21:05.92]We're the bad guy in this story.
[21:07.36]Do it.
[21:07.86]Do it.
[21:07.98]Do it.
[21:29.86]You goddamn liar.
[21:31.14]Do it.
[21:31.72]Do it.
[21:33.84]Fulfill your destiny.
[21:38.13]Holy foe!
[21:39.69]Oh my god, he actually did it.
[21:41.99]Well, welcome to the dark side.
[21:44.43]I mean, um... Hey, uh... Tuck's gonna need something for the bounty.
[21:57.49]You did the right thing, bro.
[21:59.45]You don't want to leave anyone to the freaks.
[22:01.79]Not even a piece of shit like Leon.
[22:05.55]I didn't even have time to make him a mask.
[22:13.29]Oh, no.
[22:13.82]Oh, God.
[22:14.30]I've not put him under pressure.
[22:15.50]I had six months to come up with Darth Vader.
[22:19.31]Uh, you are d-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
[22:49.61]Wait, are you telling me that there's a whole entire fucking crafting system?
[22:54.99]I'm gonna use my boomer vision.
[23:09.64]Come on, I can't like fail to pick stuff up off the ground tutorial.
[23:23.16]We'll make it quick.
[23:24.42]Will you?
[23:25.10]Are you sure?
[23:25.63]Where... I seriously need to turn on vibrations, don't I?
[23:43.06]God damn it.
[23:45.82]I hate vibrations.
[23:46.76]It makes me feel, like, ill.
[23:56.50]That didn't even help.
[24:08.01]Are you my dog?
[24:09.41]Are you pointing in the right direction here?
[24:16.02]It vibrates like you're on a hog.
[24:19.18]There's a dead guy in there.
[24:33.06]Sleeping bag?
[24:35.94]No, it's not the sleeping bag.
[24:36.96]Alright, where is this?
[24:49.45]I'm serious, where the fuck is this?
[25:05.10]That shit- that- what?!
[25:08.42]There wasn't even an indicator!
[25:09.58]Alright, why was there an indicator for the first one and no indicator for the second one?
[25:19.85]There was no square on the screen.
[25:21.03]Alright, he's- alright, we'll expand the medical category.
[25:30.87]Hold R1 to craft a bandage.
[25:33.07]How many can I make?
[25:35.51]He's gone.
[25:37.71]What?
[25:37.95]Alright, let's use the bandage.
[25:43.74]So you're gonna go in the wheel.
[25:47.00]Just hold R2.
[25:47.64]Okay, it's got a fucking wheel.
[25:53.75]We're really ticking all the AAA video game boxes, aren't we?
[25:59.18]Sprinting and rolling depletes your stamina.
[26:01.76]If you run out, you need to wait for it to recover.
[26:04.60]For a second I thought that said you need to drink water, and I was about to say no, don't make me do that.
[26:31.08]Died to loot wheel.
[26:32.40]Step back, step back.
[26:32.84]Get away from that.
[26:33.58]All it takes is a guy with a cigar in his mouth and you're done.
[27:05.09]I think I got a better idea.
[27:06.11]Let me just get it while we're out here.
[27:08.52]Can we ride this?
[27:13.22]Crazy Willy's isn't far from here.
[27:15.46]Let's just head over there.
[27:17.04]What are you thinking?
[27:18.00]We were going out hunting tonight anyway.
[27:21.90]Those are really light.
[27:22.72]Crazy Willy's is as good a place as any.
[27:25.60]Yeah, okay.
[27:27.38]Oh, we're doing bunk beds.
[27:33.33]Nice.
[27:33.87]I have no control.
[27:36.71]I just have to hold on.
[27:39.15]I say we head south, so we have a little bit...
[28:04.84]That just scared the fuck out of me.
[28:06.89]What the fuck would you do?
[28:08.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:12.33]Why did this just come up?
[28:13.47]What's going on?
[28:14.61]Hold on.
[28:14.97]You went too fast here.
[28:16.67]Swipe left.
[28:20.85]Did I press that?
[28:21.78]Maybe I pressed it.
[28:23.82]Swipe left.
[28:24.70]Can I go back?
[28:27.78]Swipe left or press R1 to view inventory and get info on gear, crafting supplies.
[28:32.10]Okay.
[28:32.22]Okay.
[28:34.01]Storylines menu.
[28:35.01]Swipe up or press R1 to view... Swipe up?
[28:39.95]So it's swiping.
[28:42.89]So we got skills... Okay, did I level up or something?
[28:49.73]No, no, it requires a skill point.
[28:52.27]Jesus Christ!
[28:53.93]What's happening?
[29:04.98]This is... That was scaring me.
[29:08.10]Oh, it's... Oh!
[29:10.10]Oh, that's what's happening.
[29:11.24]If you touch the... If you touch the pad here on the PS4, it opens the menu.
[29:17.31]Oh, I'm gonna scream about this later.
[29:24.77]I'm gonna be in the middle of a fight, and I'm gonna fucking, like, move my thumb and touch it.
[29:27.89]And it's gonna open, and I'm gonna scream.
[29:28.99]Come on, help me move it.
[29:34.71]Move the truck with our bare hands?
[29:36.15]Pushing vehicles.
[29:36.97]Some vehicles can be moved to clear a blocked path.
[29:38.64]Hold square to push them.
[29:40.88]Put tape on your controller.
[29:42.56]I thought someone was driving.
[29:50.42]Yeah, I don't know how this happened.
[29:55.54]I got stuck in the snow.
[29:57.08]Hey!
[30:09.39]He wanted to punch him.
[30:10.89]He wanted to punch that guy.
[30:12.07]He wasn't even aiming for me.
[30:16.66]What?
[30:17.74]Why?
[30:18.80]Why?
[30:19.22]Hold L in any enemy's direction and press R2.
[30:24.64]Choose a direction and then tap R1 to roll.
[30:45.94]I just slit everybody's throats.
[30:52.83]Okay.
[30:54.71]Anybody have any loot on them?
[31:01.17]Wow, Jake, you're a real psycho.
[31:04.91]I don't know what it is, man.
[31:05.79]I have to split their throats.
[31:12.41]No loot?
[31:12.91]Yeah, what's up with that?
[31:13.65]Dude, the best trope in all of media.
[31:27.70]It's definitely you punched a guy in the face you weren't supposed to punch in the face.
[31:31.96]Imagine like you punched your friend directly in his face as hard as you could because somebody ducked.
[31:37.83]Slowly.
[31:38.29]Okay.
[31:49.47]That would cause, there would be ripple effects for what that happened there for 10 years.
[31:55.87]You would never trust each other.
[31:56.97]There'd be a falling out months and weeks later.
[31:59.54]It would never, it would change your friendship forever.
[32:02.98]Yeah, a lot of good it did him.
[32:05.32]I'd rather be buried back with the goddamn pioneers.
[32:08.12]Yeah.
[32:09.40]Shit.
[32:10.02]Look at them all.
[32:11.06]Okay, go through the tunnel.
[32:12.14]This is the lot of them.
[32:13.62]They're thinking, hey, Mr. Fed, can we sit here and wait till the goddamn horde comes through and just kills us all?
[32:18.93]Bad way to go out, trapped in a shithole like this.
[32:21.17]Can we siphon some of the gas from these cars?
[32:27.67]That would be a real survival game.
[32:31.73]No, we just walked 10 feet for another cutscene.
[32:33.84]Why not just have the cutscene go through here?
[32:37.04]There.
[32:38.18]Come on, let's go.
[32:40.60]Wait, hold up.
[32:41.16]How many Molotovs you got left back here?
[32:42.78]Let's hit it on the way back.
[32:43.82]Leave it.
[32:44.18]Yeah.
[32:46.94]Somebody show the clip.
[32:47.73]Do it.
[32:48.47]I know somebody has that one.
[32:50.29]Do it.
[32:53.49]No, not the slap.
[32:54.51]I'm talking about the puke.
[32:55.89]Why?
[32:56.91]Why would you do the slap?
[32:58.29]Here we go.
[33:12.94]Two fucking enemies.
[33:13.94]What is this game?
[33:18.88]Can I play?
[33:25.46]I got to shoot twice.
[33:29.14]They could have done all this in one cutscene and then like just teach me how to shoot in two minutes.
[33:33.95]Oh, you're never gonna get this day back.
[33:41.63]You're never getting these days back, Jeremy!
[33:44.16]These guys are on the map.
[33:52.62]I'm being too harsh.
[33:53.38]They need to, like, teach people how to play.
[33:56.00]Do I have to get on his bike?
[34:06.51]I can't, like, there's no more enemies or anything?
[34:07.91]I'd have to get on the bike.
[34:09.90]He's just following me.
[34:13.79]Okay, if there's another cutscene here, I'm gonna be very, very... No, wait, are you actually just following me on the bike?
[34:22.27]I can't get on the bike.
[34:29.24]Oh, God.
[34:30.72]Why don't we just ride through?
[34:40.88]Ooh, there is loot.
[34:46.05]Oh shit, we can turn this off.
[34:46.93]I've played Left 4 Dead before.
[34:47.99]Can we steal something from here?
[34:54.27]You know anything about cars?
[35:00.14]Plus one scrap.
[35:02.30]Oh no, you unplugged the car from the outlet.
[35:07.26]How many bolts do I have?
[35:08.95]You're not getting your bike through there.
[35:10.96]Try that service tunnel.
[35:12.16]See if you can clear us a path from the other side.
[35:14.88]I got it.
[35:15.60]Just keep your headlight pointed that way.
[35:19.52]Please keep your headlight pointed at the objective, because I would have missed it.
[35:23.52]And I actually would have.
[35:25.53]I went too far up.
[35:27.35]Wait, hold on.
[35:31.77]This game probably has secrets.
[35:33.69]I shouldn't just be running through as fast as I can.
[35:39.11]Whoa, scary!
[35:42.55]Am I gonna have a fist fight with a zombie?
[35:47.28]Aw, that would've been so fucking funny.
[35:50.20]You redeem this entire first, like, 30-40 minutes of the game if me and that zombie have a fist fight.
[35:56.46]He, like, punches me in the face, like, three or four times.
[35:58.22]He gives a hand up like a boxer.
[36:04.48]Where's the flashlight coming from?
[36:06.09]Um, I think my eyes.
[36:10.46]Where's the flashlight coming from?
[36:16.88]No, it's just a spotlight.
[36:22.61]Oh, fuck.
[36:22.95]I was talking a lot of shit.
[36:23.87]He does have superpowers.
[36:26.38]I'm sorry.
[36:26.70]I retract everything I said.
[36:28.16]Never mind.
[36:37.38]Every barker has... has... what?
[36:40.46]Light eyes?
[36:41.08]Oops!
[36:50.00]Come on, get in here quick!
[36:50.96]We gotta get out of here!
[36:52.71]Let's go!
[36:55.27]No, let me... Shoot him!
[37:04.29]Shoot!
[37:10.29]Shoot him!
[37:17.21]He doesn't give a shit.
[37:18.98]He doesn't care if I live or die.
[37:20.96]He was pretending to help.
[37:25.82]That backwards side gun hold was just like, ah, whatever.
[37:30.18]I'll find another friend.
[37:31.76]That's a double.
[37:35.38]Is there a zoom in feature?
[37:40.53]They're blocking the bullets?
[37:43.75]He wasn't actually trying to block the bullets, was he?
[37:45.97]With his hands?
[37:47.33]I don't have any bullets left.
[37:54.68]Did I fail the tutorial?
[38:05.84]Another nest.
[38:08.83]Knife.
[38:09.51]Yeah, that's right.
[38:10.41]I have a knife.
[38:11.09]Ooh, you're gonna teach me how to throw a Molotov.
[38:13.25]Burn the Freaker Nest.
[38:14.31]Okay, well... Give him to me.
[38:16.41]You got any shit to make more.
[38:37.72]Alright, throwables category.
[38:41.35]There's rocks.
[38:42.59]Okay.
[38:44.79]So, I mean, there are rocks.
[38:51.82]With the Molotov equipped, hold L2 and aim, tap R2 to throw.
[38:54.86]Alright, so there's a nest right there.
[39:01.52]I don't have any bullets.
[39:02.58]I don't have any bullets!
[39:11.66]What are they doing?
[39:23.60]Oh, he got him!
[39:25.53]It's more fun to dodge around than it is to do anything else.
[39:34.33]Round one of zombies.
[39:37.17]Alright, get us out of here.
[39:39.63]I've been thinking about what you said about riding north.
[39:43.13]Just saying.
[39:43.73]You need to get away from here.
[39:45.23]Clear your head, you know?
[39:47.83]I'm collecting their ears for some crazy reason.
[39:51.01]Hell yeah, brother.
[39:52.09]Now you're talking.
[39:52.96]25.
[39:52.98]65 to 25.
[39:57.64]Sounds about right.
[39:58.58]You wanted a freak show.
[40:08.23]Shit, place is crawling.
[40:10.25]You got any more of those molotovs?
[40:16.27]Oh, I got an idea.
[40:17.05]Hey, you just scream as loud as you can over here off the bike.
[40:22.05]And wait till they all run over to you, and then I'll leave.
[40:26.11]Shit, we're going to need more ammo.
[40:36.09]What are you thinking?
[40:38.37]Wow.
[40:38.67]It's actually what we're doing.
[40:39.47]That's the real plan!
[40:41.95]Alright.
[40:42.21]He didn't leave the bike though.
[40:43.67]So he's gonna pull them and I have to get to the garage.
[40:46.61]I would laugh if he just crashed and flew off.
[41:10.03]I don't have any bullets, though.
[41:11.01]I'm gonna have to really play tactically.
[41:13.77]You got a death wish.
[41:14.97]Find Crazy Willy's garage.
[41:16.21]Go on.
[41:17.77]Get out of here, you little shits.
[41:25.36]Newts.
[41:26.58]Newts are skittish and usually stick to out-of-reach places like rooftops.
[41:29.82]They will attack if they sense you are low on health or if you invade their turf.
[41:33.33]Yeah, that's right.
[41:45.47]Oh, I'm invading their turf.
[41:59.62]Get away from me!
[42:09.39]What?
[42:09.67]What?
[42:11.11]What?
[42:11.43]They're like zombies!
[42:12.61]They're like aliens!
[42:16.64]Alright, hold on.
[42:17.10]So what on the screen here is... I didn't even hurt anybody.
[42:27.30]Alright, so we have to get into the garage.
[42:34.15]Bushes.
[42:34.53]Provide cover for stealth if you haven't been spotted.
[42:36.23]Remain crouched with circle to stay hidden and use rocks to create distractions.
[42:40.27]Okay.
[43:03.82]I didn't even need to use the... He didn't see me, I technically did it in stealth.
[43:11.62]Oh shit!
[43:30.57]Alright, you got a guy right there.
[43:31.83]I'm going to actually do the rest in stealth.
[43:33.90]I'm going to play this like a true video game.
[43:38.54]Watch this.
[43:38.94]Ready?
[43:41.58]Well, it takes the gun out immediately.
[43:42.94]I just want rocks.
[43:50.67]Does he see me?
[43:54.06]Can he see me?
[44:17.71]This is actually fun.
[44:19.15]This is a fun game.
[44:20.01]I can hear the alarm.
[44:33.54]No ammo.
[44:34.20]What?
[44:34.66]Oh, you have- I gotta stop fucking around.
[44:36.32]There's ammo in the game.
[44:46.89]Nice dodge, holy shit!
[44:54.06]What?
[44:56.28]Okay, so, there's a guy in here.
[44:58.95]Wait.
[45:05.43]Alright, no more fucking around, let's actually do this correct.
[45:17.94]Where'd the buddy go?
[45:19.42]Yeah, that's true.
[45:20.24]Where is he?
[45:21.96]He was riding around out here.
[45:24.18]Gas?
[45:25.02]Ooh, gas.
[45:47.66]Gas cans can be used to refuel your bike and generators.
[45:49.86]Wait, I can throw?
[45:52.74]Can I just pour it out?
[45:53.50]Holy shit!
[45:58.85]Drink the gas.
[46:07.23]Spark plug?
[46:10.65]Silence your guns by attaching a suppressor.
[46:12.51]Select a compatible gun on the survival wheel and press R1 to attach it.
[46:15.72]Did I get a suppressor from the car?
[46:20.44]That's a little odd.
[46:26.91]It's R1, right?
[46:29.61]R1?
[46:32.07]R1.
[46:32.21]Is that not... Am I not doing this right?
[46:40.75]Yeah, R1.
[46:44.01]R1.
[46:44.57]I don't know.
[46:55.15]I'm gonna blow that up.
[46:55.92]You know I'm gonna.
[46:57.96]Ooh!
[46:59.64]Yes!
[47:04.52]I need to try.
[47:07.92]No, I want to hit.
[47:08.68]I want to swing at it.
[47:11.72]I got a sick.
[47:13.16]A stick.
[47:15.05]Wait, hold on.
[47:15.97]I want to look around.
[47:23.73]What's in here?
[47:24.07]A spark plug?
[47:28.39]Maybe I don't have enough materials.
[47:32.23]Alright, there's something over here.
[47:36.93]Explosive objects will blow up when damaged by bullets or other explosives.
[47:40.48]So I can't, like, do anything with this.
[47:46.04]No, that's gonna explode.
[47:47.30]This is an explosive.
[47:48.12]I'm holding an explosive.
[47:49.15]If I throw an explosive at an explosive, it's at explosives.
[47:52.33]So I'm not gonna do that.
[47:53.05]Alright, let's just get in here.
[47:57.31]What do you mean, yes you can?
[48:03.10]Not real.
[48:11.27]Okay, see?
[48:12.41]It's plastic versus metal.
[48:13.97]It's not explosive.
[48:14.97]It's what's inside that matters.
[48:16.51]Alright, break it with the knife.
[48:24.69]Nope.
[48:29.94]Okay, we gotta get in there somehow.
[48:33.94]Up on the roof.
[48:38.34]Let's use our boomer vision.
[48:43.18]Shoot it.
[48:43.42]I don't have any bullets.
[48:45.34]I'm out of bullets.
[48:49.81]Baseball bat.
[48:51.19]Damage and durability.
[48:52.15]Oh, I want the bat.
[48:56.93]I love baseball bats.
[49:06.26]Can I throw stuff?
[49:07.36]Can I throw the bat?
[49:26.85]Imagine if it went through the cannon and exploded.
[49:28.61]Alright, we got any more Freakers?
[49:32.15]I don't think so.
[49:36.42]I need to bring this with me, though.
[49:39.82]I might need it.
[49:40.32]I don't see any more Freakers.
[49:48.26]No more Trunks?
[49:51.50]This is just open.
[49:55.32]Ooh, another Gas.
[49:57.61]No, I don't want that.
[49:59.19]Battery, though.
[50:01.33]Battery.
[50:01.90]Take the battery.
[50:12.24]I'm not going to drink the gas.
[50:21.01]It'll get sidearm suppressor.
[50:22.71]It'll give you energy.
[50:23.53]I don't think I... Why am I... Do I need to take this somewhere?
[50:27.17]Can I hold two?
[50:37.46]No.
[50:37.84]Which one has more in it?
[50:38.62]I'll take this one.
[50:45.46]Well, there's just a bunch of shit in here.
[50:48.96]Rag.
[50:50.70]Drink the bat.
[50:53.29]I gotta do something cool with this.
[50:58.27]I'm not drinking the gasoline.
[50:59.39]I'm going to blow the gasoline.
[51:00.72]I wish I could just dump the gasoline.
[51:02.08]Alright, that's fine.
[51:05.00]Let's just get out of here.
[51:06.66]And head into the back way of the garage.
[51:10.46]Here we go.
[51:13.96]Boarded up.
[51:15.24]Well, oh, never mind.
[51:16.24]We're going this way.
[51:17.04]I can't jump.
[51:22.54]Is there a way to go all the way around?
[51:25.90]Like, up there.
[51:33.07]Can't go away.
[51:34.25]Maybe, like, can I jump on these?
[51:41.83]Well, I have to go across there.
[51:43.43]So how do I get up there?
[51:44.71]The tree?
[51:45.23]Do I have to jump from the tree?
[52:03.76]Um... I don't see a ladder.
[52:13.60]You'd think there would be a ladder out here.
[52:23.82]I don't see a ladder.
[52:29.35]Well... Um...
[52:38.20]Do I push the car over here?
[52:41.47]Can I, like, shove the car over?
[52:42.75]He's just going to edit mode.
[52:50.51]Well, it looks like I'm going over here.
[52:54.52]Can I, like... No, don't go in the dumpster.
[53:00.28]I want to, like, climb the dumpster.
[53:09.98]Uh, well.
[53:15.26]Okay.
[53:27.13]Can I go up?
[53:31.39]Compelling climb to trash gameplay.
[53:45.94]Do I just need to shoot the lock?
[53:48.06]No, I don't.
[53:53.62]Look, they're making me go, like, all the way... Do I have to shoot the lock?
[53:59.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:01.05]They wouldn't do that.
[54:02.19]They wouldn't make me do that.
[54:03.05]I don't have any bullets.
[54:15.38]I need to use a different gun.
[54:17.24]I have no bullets.
[54:22.78]I can't even, like, attempt to do that.
[54:26.89]Poor gas on the lock.
[54:30.89]Alright, well... I'm... Let's try, I guess...
[54:43.77]Go to the left and climb up, but from where?
[54:46.67]Like over here?
[54:49.43]There's like nothing over here!
[54:57.94]Is it up this?
[55:09.77]Do I actually have to jump on this thing?
[55:14.05]Alright.
[55:35.24]I didn't... that was... I had to do that.
[55:39.28]They were coming after me.
[55:41.72]Alright, so let me get in here now.
[55:46.43]Is there, like, a hatch I can pull?
[55:47.63]Can I, like, move or break something?
[55:51.81]Move something?
[55:52.31]I mean, alright, yeah.
[56:08.35]So, I'm sorry I didn't know that I'm looking for a ladder.
[56:13.22]There's one, like, little grey shed that's sittin' on the side.
[56:18.02]That's the only place you can get up.
[56:20.56]Alright, let's get some cash out of the ATM, I think.
[56:41.45]Fucking money's worthless?
[56:42.79]Don't worry.
[56:43.27]I still got plenty of gold.
[56:44.41]Alright, what else is in here?
[56:53.06]Nothing?
[56:53.58]Nothing?
[56:54.00]Let's unlock the... First of all, let's get the shortcut open.
[56:57.36]That's important.
[57:02.21]Anything in the toilets?
[57:05.43]No.
[57:05.97]Yes, there is.
[57:12.43]Elevator next to Firelink.
[57:22.13]Now what?
[57:26.15]Find the fuel pump.
[57:28.33]Was it in this room right here?
[57:30.63]Gotta be a fuel pump in here somewhere.
[57:40.15]I found the fuel pump.
[57:43.19]Boozer, you there?
[57:45.13]I found the part.
[57:46.19]Dude, how long have you been in there for?
[57:48.39]There's 400 chasing me.
[57:51.17]I'm out of gas.
[57:58.96]You've been in there for an hour and a half, man.
[58:01.64]Boozman?
[58:03.98]God damn it.
[58:04.30]Hey, Boozman, I'm sorry.
[58:05.58]There was one shed that I had to climb up and I couldn't figure it out.
[58:08.50]I needed a bunch of friends to help me find it.
[58:12.01]What are you, fucking stupid?
[58:23.64]A couple thousand friends.
[58:28.52]Wait, what did I just do?
[58:30.30]Max.
[58:31.27]I have too many of these, I gotta craft some stuff.
[58:32.81]Hold on.
[58:40.09]Can I craft ammo?
[58:47.65]It's refined metal.
[58:48.89]Alright, let's go find Boomer.
[58:57.67]Hold on.
[58:59.53]Hang on, Boozman.
[59:00.28]I'm coming.
[59:00.64]What if it was my gas tank?
[59:05.66]Oh, he's up there.
[59:07.10]He's just doing donuts up there.
[59:12.06]Is he really just, like, spinning around in circles?
[59:18.76]Ah, you took way too long.
[59:22.09]Blind.
[59:23.07]Streamer's blind.
[59:24.41]He did this to me.
[59:28.23]These tats are dead symbols of a dead man.
[59:31.61]Dead symbols of the lost.
[59:34.03]Get off me, you son of a bitch's biker man.
[59:39.98]You must be brought low, biker man, for you are lost.
[59:48.92]What the hell?
[59:54.31]Ow!
[59:59.35]Get low, get low.
[60:01.83]Is that a song?
[60:02.75]Are they singing a song?
[60:09.85]You can enter cover by crouching next to it.
[60:11.38]Press circle to toggle crouch.
[60:16.01]So those are rippers.
[60:17.79]Shoulder swapping while aiming L2 press X to shoulder swap.
[60:23.98]These tats are dead symbols of a dead man.
[60:27.32]Dead symbols of the lost.
[60:30.58]Get off me!
[60:33.02]Mrs. Bikerman.
[60:35.61]You must be brought low, Bikerman.
[60:38.05]For you are lost.
[60:39.57]We are found.
[60:41.27]No!
[60:45.90]Let me make a couple things here.
[60:46.90]Let me just start crafting.
[60:49.14]I'm trying to hit him in the head with a rock.
[60:53.70]That may have been a mistake.
[61:18.13]I see.
[61:31.38]I was trying to throw a rock at my friend's head.
[61:34.26]I'm going to kill them all.
[61:35.20]Every fucking one of them.
[61:38.26]Oh, my god.
[61:39.46]Shit.
[61:39.97]Let me help you up.
[61:41.37]No.
[61:41.55]What's wrong with you, Doc?
[61:43.31]Get up.
[61:44.63]Fucking rippers.
[61:45.31]You got to go.
[61:48.04]Uh, with?
[61:50.22]What's with the crowd?
[61:51.02]It's us.
[61:51.32]Yeah, there they are.
[61:52.46]I needed like three or four thousand of them to figure out what to do.
[62:16.63]Streamer sucks.
[62:17.31]Game sucks.
[62:18.71]Idiot blind.
[62:19.53]That's what they're all screaming.
[62:32.22]He can't possibly be this bad.
[62:35.94]Next.
[62:42.26]He can't reach it.
[62:50.02]He's not pretending.
[62:54.86]Hey, dude, you all right?
[62:55.96]You okay?
[62:56.28]All right, here we go.
[63:07.66]Welcome to the game.
[63:08.40]I thought we'd never make it.
[63:13.96]Hey, why don't you wait out here?
[63:17.38]Let me make sure it's all clear.
[63:20.03]This guy's all fucked up.
[63:21.93]This is Ride to Hell Retribution, with zombies in place of the so-bad-it's-good factor.
[63:46.33]I mean, I can't make that assessment yet.
[63:48.87]Can we just dump hydrogen peroxide all over you?
[63:50.76]You're making me itch.
[64:14.75]All right, so Drifter is on the mountain.
[64:20.29]6% he's my brother.
[64:20.87]I'm 6% of the way through the story.
[64:31.66]New items.
[64:41.76]Primary.
[64:42.40]Sidearms.
[64:43.02]Special.
[64:43.70]Primary.
[64:44.60]Nothing.
[64:45.82]Sidearms.
[64:47.24]9mm.
[64:48.76]With the can on it.
[64:54.19]Okay.
[64:55.85]Crossbow.
[64:56.83]Good in stealth situations, its versatility goes up the more bolts you can craft.
[65:00.49]The crossbow has a longer reload time.
[65:05.78]Alright, let's put it on.
[65:15.29]Drifters on the mountain, return to your bike.
[65:17.97]But hold on.
[65:18.61]So this is where I store my weapons and items and stuff.
[65:22.05]What else is in here?
[65:25.35]Just a bunch of ammo.
[65:29.29]Why do I even have... The shot... How do I... I want to, like, reload that.
[65:40.81]Do I have to... It's one of those things where I have to walk out and then reload.
[65:45.33]No, it's locked.
[65:52.24]See, there we go.
[65:52.94]Okay, now reload the damn gun.
[65:54.52]Reload them all.
[65:58.70]And now take the ammo.
[65:59.72]Because I can take more ammo, right?
[66:02.04]Or no.
[66:06.01]Well, whatever.
[66:06.97]I thought I was going to be able to load the gun and take more ammo.
[66:11.11]Pick this one.
[66:11.91]Okay.
[66:14.79]Now what's this?
[66:17.90]Maneuver quickly through the safehouse gate to avoid letting enemies in.
[66:22.96]Wait, people can just come in?
[66:25.70]Heal.
[66:26.92]Oh, you actually... Okay, thankfully you can just press this button.
[66:31.72]So that's... Fully heal.
[66:34.03]Anything else in here I need to do?
[66:35.61]Or can see?
[66:36.15]It's just ammo, alright.
[66:41.23]Crafting bench or something?
[66:43.41]It's a bat.
[66:44.69]I'll take it.
[66:45.13]Alright, well, let's go.
[66:50.70]What do you mean?
[67:01.09]I can't just drive my bike?
[67:04.11]I can't drive his bike to my bike and somebody will get it?
[67:06.81]You can now create a new crossbow boat.
[67:10.24]By crafting them.
[67:11.86]Cedar saplings provide the wood and scrap makes the tip.
[67:14.92]Combine the two in the survival wheel.
[67:17.10]Alright, so I need saplings and scrap to make bolts.
[67:21.70]Makes sense.
[67:22.50]I can't even...
[67:34.67]I'm gonna shoot him in the head.
[67:41.58]Follow mission.
[67:54.69]Crossbow bolts are affected by gravity and will drop as they travel to the target.
[67:57.85]When shooting at something far away, aim higher.
[68:03.84]I gotta follow this guy.
[68:09.55]We just have to run behind him.
[68:12.79]Alright, he's in the base.
[68:13.81]We made it to the Fallout base.
[68:16.31]Clear the Marauder camp.
[68:20.28]You got it.
[68:22.64]Target the binoculars with up and press R2 to mark.
[68:26.00]Marking enemies makes it easier to follow their movements.
[68:28.20]Tracked human enemies will display their awareness levels.
[68:32.63]Alright.
[68:38.58]Let's just do it.
[68:42.63]How do I zoom in?
[68:44.17]L3 is zoom.
[68:46.75]Well, L3 is zoom.
[68:48.05]Okay, I'm walking towards them with binoculars.
[68:51.97]I saw L3.
[68:53.83]Technically, this is zooming in.
[68:55.53]It's just walking forward.
[69:00.19]Where are the others?
[69:16.19]That guy's alive?!
[69:17.70]Alright, where's the rest of them?
[69:56.99]I think I saw something.
[69:58.01]Yeah, well you may have.
[69:59.99]Stool leg?
[70:04.39]No, the weapon I had was better.
[70:06.43]Alright, got pistol ammo.
[70:12.70]Do I have an indicator over here?
[70:27.30]Wait, is some?
[70:29.13]Beside you!
[70:31.99]Beside you!
[70:55.83]That's a bird!
[70:56.41]Speaking of head... Well, neither are you!
[71:23.30]Regaining stealth.
[71:24.32]If you've been spotted by an enemy, get out of their line of sight and hide.
[71:26.82]They'll eventually give up the search.
[71:30.42]Really.
[71:44.77]I tried to backstab her.
[71:50.50]That's the last of them.
[71:53.86]All right, wait, wait, wait, let me check around.
[71:56.24]She was walking up backwards.
[71:59.52]Nothing else.
[72:01.64]Free shit.
[72:24.98]It's fucked up that you're killing their entire family for no reason.
[72:29.21]Well, it's not for no reason.
[72:30.63]It's to survive.
[72:31.29]I missed a rifle.
[72:40.40]Wait, there's a rifle?
[72:41.78]Am I getting baited?
[72:42.58]I don't know if I believe that.
[72:54.32]Bad weather can affect enemies' ability to see and hear.
[72:56.18]It can also affect the conditions of trails and roads.
[72:58.32]There's somebody over here.
[73:01.10]Swimmers are sensitive to light, feeding mostly at night or during heavy storms.
[73:03.94]Taking on more than one is death.
[73:06.58]Or something.
[73:19.59]It's not worth it.
[73:24.58]Will they have anything good?
[73:30.58]I might be able to get a stealth.
[73:31.38]Hold on.
[73:52.03]Got him!
[73:55.20]Alright, there's only one more.
[74:12.29]He was telling me to run.
[74:23.60]Why would I run?
[74:30.80]There's only one.
[74:37.52]It's raining all the time.
[74:38.66]All the rain.
[74:39.43]Rain, rain, rain, rain.
[74:41.79]Oh, shit.
[74:43.13]Is somebody right here?
[74:44.87]Oh, fuck.
[74:45.15]There is somebody right there.
[74:51.55]What about the rock?
[74:52.51]Go to the rock first.
[74:56.76]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[75:01.58]What the hell just happened?
[75:02.72]That was weird.
[75:04.06]Does he know I'm here?
[75:05.76]What is he doing?
[75:10.37]Oh my god, he's doing the golem.
[75:11.93]This is bad.
[75:13.45]I think I have to...
[75:33.00]What?
[75:33.73]Durability meter.
[75:34.49]Melee weapons found on the field break easily.
[75:36.73]Pay attention to the durability meter.
[75:38.93]If there's a blinking red icon, there are only a few hits left before it breaks.
[75:43.21]Oh, I still got a knife.
[75:50.04]Okay.
[76:00.20]Slide.
[76:00.97]Stay down.
[76:04.98]Give me my bike back.
[76:07.50]So we can continue playing the game.
[76:09.32]Alright, there's still two here.
[76:12.50]Give me the rock.
[76:17.39]No, you go that way.
[76:22.07]Melee stealth kill you.
[76:23.41]Car?
[76:24.93]Car?
[76:35.68]Always check the cars.
[76:38.20]Got the camp right here.
[76:43.43]Nothing in the boomer vision.
[76:44.35]I need to stop calling it that.
[76:49.21]Somebody see me?
[76:50.67]You wanna hear me?
[76:52.79]Rifle over here, rifle over here.
[76:54.69]What's this clip?
[76:56.03]Why is everybody clipping this?
[76:59.12]Oh wait, I can't watch that.
[77:01.22]Who cares about the rifle?
[77:10.95]Turn around.
[77:14.09]You, and then you.
[77:15.35]Am I getting experience for this?
[77:16.80]There's EXP in this game, right?
[77:22.10]Wow!
[77:24.56]He just dodged it!
[77:36.10]Melee in this game feels very good.
[77:38.20]To the point where you could just melee everybody.
[77:42.98]Uh, everyone.
[77:43.44]You can just melee anyone.
[77:50.34]Maybe that's just the initial enemy.
[78:00.80]Alright, so give me my bike.
[78:05.52]And let's move on.
[78:08.36]Somebody stole the bike.
[78:09.20]I have to keep going.
[78:13.84]My bike's gone.
[78:14.92]What a waste of 500 million dollars.
[78:18.80]I don't think it cost that much to make this game.
[78:21.24]I think it was more like... Fuck.
[78:24.24]Dammit, Copeland.
[78:25.40]It was probably like 40 million.
[78:26.68]Hey, you're from Copeland's cab?
[78:28.34]Where the hell is my bike?
[78:30.41]What?
[78:31.03]Hey, stop.
[78:31.71]Why?
[78:31.99]Goddammit.
[78:33.29]I didn't take your bike, man.
[78:34.47]It's clear.
[78:36.21]I'm not gonna kill you.
[78:37.77]Stop wearing it.
[78:38.43]Jesus Christ.
[78:45.75]You can't shoot him.
[78:46.69]It was aiming around him.
[78:48.29]Let's see if I can get one rock throw.
[78:57.39]Why would this guy be over here?
[79:05.96]There's no reason for this guy to be hiding here.
[79:07.54]Just waiting for me to come know that my bike is stolen?
[79:09.72]He's standing behind the car.
[79:17.95]That was a huge underhanded throw.
[79:22.26]Nobody can throw that far underhand.
[79:35.70]No overhead throws?
[79:37.02]That's kind of ridiculous.
[79:47.08]It's me!
[79:47.64]Open up!
[79:48.02]He's here!
[79:49.40]He's here!
[79:49.98]That's right, I am.
[79:54.70]Fuck no!
[79:55.44]I didn't mean to do that.
[79:57.10]They don't really care.
[80:09.53]Now he throws it over him.
[80:14.13]Should I just shoot this guy?
[80:15.24]Let me, like, make... Hold on.
[80:16.32]Let's...
[80:20.29]Can I craft a craft?
[80:21.13]Bullets, right?
[80:21.67]I don't think I can craft anything.
[80:22.79]Bolt, they don't have enough.
[80:25.83]I need cedar sapling.
[80:30.33]Well, we're just going to have to shoot people.
[80:31.57]Oh, I... This is... I just... We just go walk in.
[80:52.09]Yeah, that's where I'm headed.
[80:54.51]So it's just a town.
[80:55.51]Okay.
[80:56.57]I thought this was a bandit camp.
[81:00.63]I was about to go in here and just start shooting people.
[81:04.77]Alright, here's the kitchen.
[81:05.69]I'm trying to plan how to go in and kill people.
[81:11.83]Meat and plants can be collected and turned into encampment kitchens for trust and credits.
[81:15.05]Different types of meat and plants provide different rewards.
[81:18.10]Why does somebody always call me at the worst possible moment?
[81:21.20]Why do you have to call me?
[81:23.30]Okay.
[81:23.52]Are there animals in this game?
[81:28.34]I mean, I guess I saw the elk, but there's tigers and bears and shit.
[81:38.42]Okay.
[81:42.00]Bounties.
[81:47.42]Freaker ears can be collected and turned into new camp and bounty collected for trust and credits.
[81:52.25]Different Freakers have different rewards.
[81:53.87]Alright, so I can just turn these in for money.
[81:56.65]Swarmer Ear, Newt Ear.
[82:00.72]I guess we can just sell them, right?
[82:09.58]Is there any reason to not do that?
[82:12.60]Merchant.
[82:12.88]Hey, Manny.
[82:21.61]I haven't seen you in a while lately.
[82:24.20]Been too busy to notice.
[82:25.38]Nose down.
[82:27.00]Work hard, they feed you.
[82:28.12]Yeah, a camper's life.
[82:30.56]Yeah, a camper's life.
[82:33.02]I read a book once.
[82:34.30]Zen and the Art of Bike Repair.
[82:35.84]You ever read it?
[82:36.81]Nah, that book doesn't exist, man.
[82:40.61]Ran a shop.
[82:41.59]Farewell.
[82:42.57]Made all the grease monkeys read it.
[82:44.85]Being a mechanic requires great peace of mind and sense.
[82:48.92]Try working on an empty stomach.
[82:50.60]That'll focus your mind.
[82:51.74]Manny, I'm looking for a bike.
[82:53.28]Yeah?
[82:54.48]Oh.
[82:55.08]Hold on.
[82:56.76]You don't want that one.
[82:58.60]Why not?
[83:00.54]It just came off the truck.
[83:02.07]I mean, some dumb son of a bitch left it out in that shit.
[83:04.71]Rusted up good.
[83:05.91]It was me that did that.
[83:07.59]Fool the road that did no shit about bikes.
[83:09.85]Is that right?
[83:10.57]Yeah, that's right.
[83:11.95]Shot the hell out of this one.
[83:14.61]I just partied it out.
[83:16.91]Didn't even have a fuel pump we could have used that and fuel pump like this Okay, like this one man, oh, okay, okay See now when I said fool what I meant was The fools that bought that bike in see they didn't tie that shit down properly.
[83:35.66]So Like rattling around back there You were right about not getting this day back
[83:44.20]It's alright.
[83:44.80]We're just enjoying a new game, alright?
[83:47.95]What's with the big explosion meter?
[84:11.80]Is this guy flammable?
[84:15.20]Oh, no, I think that that's just the indicator for the quest.
[84:20.01]I thought this guy was flammable.
[84:30.28]Okay.
[84:38.62]I can't skip the optional dialogue, because when I touch the thing... Yes, I can.
[84:44.06]No, I'm not skipping it.
[84:46.76]Come on.
[84:48.00]My old man had only one home.
[84:50.10]The United States Constitution.
[84:52.83]He can only see us now.
[84:54.49]America.
[84:55.73]Land of the free.
[84:58.15]We are that.
[85:02.37]Saw Leon the other day.
[85:03.43]Yeah?
[85:05.93]He was bringing me something.
[85:07.63]Is that right?
[85:10.01]I'm not bored.
[85:11.49]I'm not bored yet.
[85:19.08]Oh, Leon.
[85:19.62]I'm not bored.
[85:25.86]Tell you what.
[85:29.78]You bring it to me.
[85:31.58]Just wait till I get on the car.
[85:33.50]You do that?
[85:34.86]Well.
[85:36.31]We'll see what we can do for you.
[85:37.53]I want one of your chapsticks.
[85:38.87]The bike.
[85:39.95]You have two of them.
[85:40.51]That your men stole.
[85:41.53]That your men parted out.
[85:43.43]Salvage, D. Salvage.
[85:45.78]All right.
[85:47.26]I'll try to keep that in mind.
[85:51.84]By the way, nice hat.
[85:52.98]What?
[85:53.68]No, this one.
[85:54.48]Don't you ever touch it.
[85:56.10]Hold on.
[85:59.47]Leon wore a hat like this, didn't he?
[86:01.41]I swear to God.
[86:02.19]Don't.
[86:03.91]You want to do business in my camp?
[86:06.34]Is it weird that I feel like somebody sneezed this story into my head last night?
[86:14.76]That's the only way I can describe it.
[86:31.20]is there was a storyline that somebody just, like, fucking opened up my head, just with a buzzsaw, pulled back my skull, and, like, took and just, and covered it up, and then shook my head and woke me back up, and I was like, oh, okay, I think I know.
[86:58.52]I mean, I'm not really paying too much attention.
[87:01.24]I mean, I am, but I guess there's only so much you can.
[87:03.40]Can we talk?
[87:16.23]Can't even talk?
[87:17.50]Why can I not talk?
[87:18.26]I can't believe there's no talk button.
[87:28.29]Alright, let me go to the... Hold on.
[87:29.53]Before I, like, go anywhere.
[87:31.81]Where's that, uh... The merchant.
[87:34.05]Yeah, they sell guns, ammo, and supplies.
[87:38.35]If you have enough credits of trust, you can buy shit.
[87:42.90]So, ammo.
[87:43.44]Pistol ammo.
[87:43.94]How much do I have?
[87:45.58]143?
[87:45.60]Let me buy ammo.
[87:49.98]Upgrades.
[87:50.46]Suppressor.
[87:51.58]Health.
[87:51.86]Med kit.
[87:52.88]Throwable.
[87:53.30]Ooh, grenades.
[87:54.00]Can't get them, though.
[87:56.22]locker oh you can go into your locker okay yeah all right look deep hold up I just want to say how sorry I am I I didn't know I swear you have any idea how much time I put into that bike it was a drifter bike manny I know I know I'll make a yacht waiting room I put together a new one you call this piece of a bike
[88:26.32]I did it.
[88:27.06]100% of the game.
[88:50.25]Plus a thousand trust.
[88:51.75]Gear.
[88:52.60]There we go.
[88:53.02]I can't wait to be doing that.
[88:54.34]Me and Boozer can't ride north till I fix up this bike.
[88:56.58]Get some better gear.
[89:00.16]Give me this bike.
[89:01.82]Finally.
[89:03.58]Ride to the Nero checkpoint.
[89:06.17]Let's go.
[89:08.15]Let's go!
[89:21.29]What are you doing here, man?
[89:22.21]God damn it.
[89:24.75]It's a bad game.
[89:34.17]I mean, we can't... I can't bump into somebody like that?
[89:39.25]Drift!
[89:40.07]Alright, so R2 and then circle.
[89:44.30]Booster, you there?
[89:46.08]Yeah, thank you.
[89:48.42]How you doing?
[89:49.08]How's the arm?
[89:53.16]Like I said, I'll be fine.
[89:56.05]I'm still going to head to that Nero checkpoint to find some sterile bandages, ointments.
[90:02.83]Can you fall off the bike?
[90:04.15]Sure, whatever.
[90:05.71]I'm going to go out and make sure the mountain's clear.
[90:08.96]No, those are third degree burns.
[90:10.86]You stay there, you rest, okay?
[90:12.34]I'll be there as soon as I can.
[90:14.12]I'm here.
[90:14.48]I guess.
[90:16.24]Only one way to find out.
[90:17.20]I guess I could do something.
[90:25.49]Yeah, yeah, I guess, I guess, I'll see what I can find, I guess.
[90:29.92]This is it, the Nero checkpoint.
[90:31.48]I gotta find some shit for boozers, huh?
[90:35.56]Hang out of the way!
[90:40.57]Alright, you can't, alright.
[90:41.75]Games is not, they're games, alright.
[90:49.65]Why even fight them?
[90:51.29]Just run into them.
[90:56.22]Quick save.
[90:56.75]Alright, keypad?
[91:03.71]Do I have the code?
[91:04.73]I gotta find the code.
[91:08.08]Okay, uh, restore power to the Nero mobile medical unit.
[91:23.86]No, I was trying to... What?
[91:26.66]I was trying to... Never mind.
[91:29.10]You know what I was trying to do.
[91:46.77]That's... I told you I was going to hit it.
[91:50.58]I told you I was going to not like that mechanic.
[91:54.58]My thumb was going to touch it.
[91:58.06]It won't start.
[91:58.60]It needs gas.
[92:01.30]I can get gas.
[92:01.94]I know what gas is.
[92:07.81]Just find a can.
[92:14.31]Saving game at the bike.
[92:18.11]Yes.
[92:19.25]I know about saving the game with a bike.
[92:22.33]I figured it out.
[92:26.13]Can.
[92:28.21]I just need a gas can.
[92:32.57]Dude, I really just love scavenging.
[92:38.47]This gives me flashbacks to when I played The Surge.
[92:42.39]Well, I'm going to have to disagree with you there for one reason.
[92:45.79]Because when I played The Surge, I was insufferably angry at the game.
[92:51.60]I hated every second of that game.
[92:54.20]So, I mean, I... I'm not, like, angry right now.
[93:02.18]I'm just kind of bewildered to try to figure out if I like it or not, you know?
[93:08.35]Bewilderment is the good way to describe this.
[93:14.12]Give me this stuff.
[93:16.64]Beer bottle, rag.
[93:17.66]Can I make this jump?
[93:24.77]You don't like it.
[93:25.43]Just get over it.
[93:28.83]That's not... That's not true yet.
[93:31.26]Hold on.
[93:32.22]You gotta give me like an... What did I just do that for?
[93:37.26]Just give me like another 30 minutes to tell you about my initial assessment of the game.
[93:43.54]Alright, where can I get gas?
[93:44.52]Probably over there.
[93:51.01]Can I just take it out of the bike?
[93:53.05]Can I put a hose in and just, like, suck the back of it?
[93:56.45]Found it.
[94:04.59]That's as far as you can throw.
[94:06.97]I need 20 hours for my initial thoughts.
[94:08.73]No, no, I just need, like, a few.
[94:21.42]We haven't even seen anything yet.
[94:23.56]All we've seen is... Who's this?
[94:25.77]Well, where are they?
[94:57.11]Oh, God.
[94:57.51]I need bandages.
[95:03.09]Can I stealth by?
[95:03.81]I probably can.
[95:14.54]Okay.
[95:15.61]I gotta, like, get in there.
[95:16.59]I don't want to go in the front door.
[95:21.27]Speakers!
[95:22.33]Where the hell are the speakers?
[95:24.33]I don't feel in danger right now.
[95:25.89]There's two people.
[95:26.87]If there were like a hundred people chasing me right now, I'd be like, oh no!
[95:33.38]There's two people.
[95:37.66]Toilet paper.
[95:40.87]And a drill.
[95:42.55]Neuro-injectors can be found inside neuro-medical... medical units at neuro-checkpoints.
[95:47.43]Use them to permanently increase your health, stamina, or focus.
[95:52.13]How would you inject yourself?
[95:55.44]Health, stamina, or focused shot skill?
[96:01.30]I don't know.
[96:01.74]This is a tough decision.
[96:03.79]Probably stamina.
[96:16.13]Alright, ready?
[96:16.47]I'm gonna press them all at the same time, and whatever one happens, happens.
[96:19.71]Ready?
[96:20.11]One, two, three!
[96:22.46]Health.
[96:30.42]There's a... some bed in here?
[96:32.00]Why would there be a gun locker here?
[96:38.89]This is weird.
[96:45.12]Speakers for the hell of the speakers.
[96:48.06]Are you just getting ready to pull up?
[96:50.27]Why?
[96:50.61]A few minutes ago, all the work we've been doing out here is a waste of time.
[96:54.33]Hundreds speakers on the highway on a farewell.
[96:58.66]There's no stopping that.
[96:59.68]We're pulling out.
[97:12.50]Alright.
[97:13.30]I'm trying.
[97:15.84]Don't even use a weapon, just swing.
[97:31.44]Speaker!
[97:33.62]This game really likes to say, son of a bitch.
[97:49.15]You missed.
[97:51.67]Oh, goddammit, just get out of my way.
[98:00.07]I have nitrous.
[98:00.81]Bruiser, goddammit, you son of a bitch.
[98:12.24]Come on!
[98:13.40]That was cool!
[98:15.13]When landing you can reduce the damage, angle your tires parallel to the ground.
[98:34.86]Did I have to freeze the game every time I want to tell you anything?
[98:41.52]Everything you say is fucking absolute...
[98:57.94]I thought it was a... I don't know what... I don't know.
[99:00.30]I just panicked.
[99:04.32]I panicked.
[99:11.55]I didn't really mean... I just panicked.
[99:13.57]I thought it was like an infected zoomer, whatever they are.
[99:18.30]Sometimes the best strategy is to run away.
[99:19.70]If you have stamina available, press L3 to sprint.
[99:22.36]Thanks for the tip on my bike at the checkpoint here.
[99:25.54]Thank you.
[99:25.90]Appreciate it.
[99:51.01]Come on!
[99:51.71]Get up there!
[99:54.67]Get up!
[99:56.95]Oh, fine.
[99:57.61]Don't let me have any fun.
[100:03.26]I was just gonna start shooting it and blow it up, but that was a bad idea.
[100:09.88]He's turning into a freaker as we speak.
[100:14.07]He's turning into a freaker as we speak!
[100:17.99]He's dead.
[100:37.81]And then you play him as a playable character.
[100:39.61]Actually, I do need help.
[100:41.69]I can't do this.
[100:42.37]I'll be better, okay?
[101:00.39]It'll be fine.
[101:01.31]Yeah, why would you leave a door wide open?
[101:04.85]This is Firewatch.
[101:06.75]It's the same thing in Firewatch.
[101:10.17]Bug the hell out.
[101:12.29]Goplin's camp.
[101:13.85]He's my brother, 12%.
[101:15.26]I have to keep Boozer alive.
[101:18.44]World's End.
[101:23.04]No starving Patriots.
[101:25.30]Locate the Cascade Radio Tower ambush camp.
[101:30.76]390 meters that way.
[101:32.38]I can't even jump off this either.
[101:34.72]I can't like jump off that and land.
[101:37.54]No, hold on.
[101:38.10]Let me... Okay, let's go.
[101:57.21]I love freedom.
[101:59.13]And environments.
[102:01.30]No.
[102:02.12]You go the right way.
[102:07.57]I would call this game in a trend of closed world games.
[102:10.77]Alright, let's go.
[102:36.38]Oh my god, what?
[102:36.92]I can't believe you hit that thing!
[102:38.06]I can't believe you hit the dog!
[102:58.56]That's it.
[102:59.34]I don't know.
[103:00.40]I want my open world freedom.
[103:01.88]I'm going this way.
[103:13.76]Something's wrong.
[103:16.12]Where's my bike?
[103:20.99]Oh.
[103:26.83]It does sound- that sound is so- it really is like waking up your grandfather.
[103:31.15]Instead of, I fell off my bike and it crushed me.
[103:34.15]Grandpa!
[103:37.40]Grandpa?
[103:39.86]Grandpa?
[103:40.42]Stop pausing the game!
[104:07.83]Use scrap to repair your bike.
[104:09.37]Approach the bike and hold circle to begin repairing it.
[104:12.75]I thought this was a town that I was supposed to go to.
[104:17.90]Alright, sounds good.
[104:25.51]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[104:27.19]Get off the bike!
[105:02.01]Okay, so I have $200 if anyone wants to sell me something.
[105:06.43]Sorry about all that.
[105:11.54]Ooh.
[105:12.88]Rifle, get, rifle, get, rifle, get, rifle, get, rifle.
[105:16.74]Germa, Germa, Germa, get, rifle, get, rifle.
[105:19.58]Okay, all right, man.
[105:27.26]Alright, so, uh, clear the ambush camp.
[105:30.77]Sure thing.
[105:31.63]So there's a couple more people here.
[105:32.63]Let me upgrade this.
[105:45.06]Video games.
[105:48.98]Ooh, wait, I need to repair the bike.
[105:59.18]No, give me the... Do I have it?
[106:06.17]Where do I... Where is... Do I have the rifle?
[106:09.87]It's on your back, idiot!
[106:28.49]That should be it.
[106:29.63]Is it repaired?
[106:30.21]I can fix this.
[106:33.63]No.
[106:35.94]I'm using scrap metal to fix it.
[106:37.84]Alright.
[106:38.88]Cool.
[106:40.32]I need to see.
[106:40.92]You know what I mean?
[106:41.60]I have to test and see if this works.
[106:44.22]This is more important than anything else in the whole game.
[106:46.03]I'm not going to sneak up on somebody.
[106:49.97]And we have to do the cool thing.
[106:53.23]The desperate thing.
[106:54.01]They have five million of these lying around.
[106:57.74]Because they want you to do this.
[106:59.26]And I'm gonna do it.
[107:10.62]Well, he did it.
[107:27.46]It works.
[107:35.10]By the way, that wouldn't even happen.
[107:37.18]Where am I?
[107:37.98]Am I all the way back here?
[107:38.88]I can fix this.
[107:42.93]Of course it works.
[107:43.99]It should work.
[107:53.36]Where did I end up?
[107:54.30]Oh, I have to do that again?
[107:58.80]I want you to do it.
[108:00.32]Yeah, it is.
[108:00.90]I'm going to turn off the headlights.
[108:08.50]This time, I'm not just going to drive straight in.
[108:10.22]I'm going to leave the bike at the door.
[108:13.72]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[108:14.92]Now, we're going to just clear the camp.
[108:16.84]We're going to do this nice and slow and skillfully.
[108:19.02]Come on.
[108:28.09]What am I holding?
[108:28.91]Is this a cocktail?
[108:29.97]Something's out here.
[108:35.23]Damn it!
[108:35.97]Burn, you asshole!
[108:37.07]Someone's hit!
[108:47.21]Where'd the hell he go?
[108:48.85]He's hiding.
[108:49.63]Look for him.
[108:52.61]Where's that coming from?
[108:58.49]No, he's dead.
[109:00.15]Uh, yeah.
[109:02.19]Someone heard something.
[109:03.51]What was that?
[109:07.45]Fuck.
[109:12.09]What was that?
[109:17.68]I didn't think you could actually hit them with the rock.
[109:21.54]Damn it.
[109:22.52]Where is he?
[109:29.71]um you move it back I need covering fire he's covering fire a squirrel dropped an acorn on me shoot to kill
[110:00.77]I'm just pelting this lady with rocks.
[110:02.39]Uh-oh.
[110:05.67]Who?
[110:06.27]Who found me?
[110:08.41]Is he shooting at her?
[110:11.05]Are you the one throwing rocks?
[110:17.28]Are they even shooting at me?
[110:24.34]He's flanking me.
[110:27.40]Oh.
[110:32.87]Alright, well I had my fun.
[110:33.77]I was supposed to do this stealthily.
[111:02.32]Hold on, let me search their bodies.
[111:03.82]Alright, this is what I'm talking about here, man.
[111:12.21]Get them both.
[111:14.71]I need ammo for this.
[111:15.45]I don't have any ammo.
[111:25.57]Can I even replace the... I don't think I can even replace the crossbow.
[111:29.77]It's a primary.
[111:31.37]Get rifle.
[111:31.75]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[111:33.19]Check this out.
[111:34.15]Alright, we're fine.
[111:35.03]There we go.
[111:37.67]Let's just take them out.
[111:38.52]Nice and slow.
[111:40.12]Do it right.
[111:40.64]They're throwing rocks at us!
[111:49.84]How many are them?
[111:51.05]I don't know.
[111:51.45]They might be 200.
[112:11.21]They shoot when I'm... You guys are really stupid.
[112:17.61]Is he pretending to be dead?
[112:24.96]They're playing a gigantic game of telephone.
[112:37.85]Hey, he shot me!
[112:39.35]And then distance.
[112:40.15]He's been shot!
[112:40.91]Somebody shot him!
[112:42.95]Somebody shot him!
[112:45.49]Boom!
[112:49.22]Oh God, what happened here?
[112:50.58]Yeah, kill him!
[113:03.73]Kill me.
[113:13.85]Alright, I think I just alerted the horde.
[113:17.97]Did I really?
[113:18.91]Oh fuck, hold on!
[113:36.12]Where is he?
[113:36.40]He's not here?
[113:40.46]Where's this guy?
[113:48.45]Got him?
[113:54.17]What do you mean, got him?
[114:05.00]Oh, fuck.
[114:06.74]Alright, hold on.
[114:07.80]This is my opportunity to do this.
[114:11.05]Watch this, ready?
[114:11.81]I gotta get this right.
[114:19.59]Go that way.
[114:20.20]Go that way so I can throw it in the fire.
[114:22.72]Who killed who there?
[114:23.76]I don't know.
[114:24.28]Did I die there?
[114:24.76]Who killed who?
[114:25.42]Hey, where is he?
[114:25.88]We got some tail.
[114:27.28]You know, we got moonshine.
[114:50.11]I stabbed myself in the stomach.
[114:54.23]He's gonna give the same spiel.
[115:06.85]I thought I saw someone out there.
[115:24.25]He tricked me.
[115:25.39]He tricked me.
[115:31.52]Wait, I'm gonna go get another one.
[115:32.74]Just stay there.
[115:34.34]He's dumb.
[115:35.06]I'll be fine.
[115:37.32]Is somebody in this building?
[115:43.16]Get in there.
[115:47.26]He's gonna come in here, isn't he?
[115:53.33]What's head level?
[115:53.85]Right here?
[116:05.59]Right... Whoa!
[116:06.67]What?
[116:07.87]I thought the gun... I thought the rock was a fucking explosive bullet rock for a second.
[116:15.41]Where'd he go?
[116:21.71]Get in here.
[116:33.79]Yeah, I'm in there.
[116:35.33]Come on in.
[116:36.39]Just step in the door.
[116:39.55]Step inside of here.
[116:46.46]Okay, he's gonna get covered.
[116:51.10]No, don't fall back.
[116:55.45]Get in.
[117:04.02]Did they seriously run away?
[117:04.98]Alright, that's enough.
[117:37.14]Alright, let's go.
[117:44.22]Let's heal, and let's get out of here.
[117:47.44]Exclusive?
[117:48.79]This is an exclusive game.
[117:49.93]This is a Sony PlayStation exclusive.
[117:52.75]You can only get this on the PlayStation 4.
[117:54.31]Alright, this has got to be the generator, but it's been shot to hell.
[118:06.02]Turn up the difficulty.
[118:08.67]I feel like that would make the game harder, though.
[118:12.45]It makes the game difficult.
[118:13.83]I don't want to do that.
[118:15.21]You've got to get a PS4.
[118:16.33]Get one!
[118:17.75]Oh.
[118:18.57]Hey.
[118:18.77]If you had bullets, I wouldn't be breathing, would I?
[118:23.53]You've been the one throwing rocks?
[118:25.20]Please, mister.
[118:28.50]I don't shoot women if I have a choice.
[118:31.32]Do I have a choice?
[118:32.16]I ain't got nothing.
[118:33.68]I got nowhere to go.
[118:42.10]You got that way.
[118:42.90]Well, there's your opportunity.
[118:45.60]Jesus Christ.
[118:48.60]There's always some way.
[118:49.80]All right.
[118:50.50]Let's see if they got an underground bunker around here.
[118:56.90]Investigate the bunker.
[119:03.30]I got nowhere to go.
[119:04.23]We all got nowhere to go.
[119:05.95]Bunker.
[119:06.45]Yes.
[119:07.29]Here it is.
[119:09.27]I mean, here it is.
[119:26.43]I can't even slide down.
[119:27.47]I can't fast go down.
[119:29.11]I can't really.
[119:43.42]Nothing in here besides the storyline.
[119:49.29]Stupid.
[119:50.61]Stupid!
[119:51.17]There it is.
[119:52.25]Had to get it right, sorry.
[119:54.37]91% that's an A-.
[120:05.03]Gear up for the ride!
[120:06.18]Me and Boozer can't ride north until I fix up this bike.
[120:08.78]Get some better gear.
[120:11.96]Craft unlocked.
[120:12.88]Ambush Camp Hunter.
[120:14.44]I can make people?
[120:19.17]Spiked bat.
[120:21.92]Yes, yes, oh yes!
[120:26.38]Newly discovered and craftable recipes are shown in the survival wheel.
[120:29.90]This'll come in handy.
[120:31.89]Yes, yes, yes!
[120:33.41]Dick, you there?
[120:34.27]It's probably nothing.
[120:35.73]Sounded like bike engines riding somewhere on the mountain.
[120:40.54]I just finished clearing it.
[120:43.69]Use a bunk at safe locations like bunkers or the safe holes to sleep in advance time.
[120:47.59]Some challenges like infestations can be approached differently depending on the time of day.
[120:51.58]Additionally, progress can be saved when near a bunk.
[120:53.60]I'm going to climb the tower.
[120:54.46]I'm just going to close my eyes for a little bit.
[121:21.66]I'm still on the phone.
[121:25.04]You know, you say some real fucked up shit and you sleep.
[121:26.78]I don't think I've ever heard somebody say they want to shove an ice cream up their ass.
[121:34.65]Cold side first.
[121:49.54]Alright, let's go.
[121:58.56]Get up.
[121:58.88]Oh, it's X. What the fuck?
[122:03.42]That sounds like a one guy comment.
[122:19.34]Hey, Dink, you okay?
[122:21.32]You don't sound like yourself.
[122:24.74]It's nothing.
[122:25.72]You know, I just let this drifter get the drop on me.
[122:29.18]Lucky for me, she was out of ammo.
[122:32.08]You know the game's boring when the streamer retorts to ass jokes.
[122:34.58]Okay, yeah, fuck.
[122:36.05]Yes, yes, I let her go.
[122:39.35]It's a climbable tower!
[122:41.11]It's gonna get you killed.
[122:44.41]Yeah, well, something's gonna do it, right?
[122:47.46]Alright, look at the O'Leary Mountain safe house.
[122:52.90]It's doing it for me, so don't worry.
[122:55.94]Where are they?
[122:56.48]I'm gonna head out there.
[123:12.87]There's no- I can't jump?
[123:13.89]Do I actually have to climb down this?
[123:38.58]I don't want to do the whole climb again.
[123:39.87]I can't slide.
[123:40.85]Oh, Jesus.
[123:42.35]I gotta get in shape.
[123:49.91]Leap of faith?
[123:50.69]Nah, but I mean, there's no... I can, like, not... I guess this is how you actually would do it.
[123:56.06]Yeah, come on, keep going.
[123:57.34]Almost there.
[124:05.48]Oh, shit's killing me.
[124:12.47]I just have to go up and down the ladder.
[124:24.35]That's it.
[124:26.16]Locate the camp.
[124:27.86]Can I call my bike?
[124:28.64]Can I whistle for my bike?
[124:42.28]Now you can fall off.
[124:44.92]Now you fall off and take damage when you fall.
[124:49.60]Took us this far to figure that out.
[124:51.19]Alright, there's a... Encore.
[125:05.42]Encore.
[125:07.88]Encore.
[125:14.52]I could do that.
[125:15.28]That's bullshit.
[125:17.00]I swear to God, I could fall down this.
[125:19.94]I could go down that.
[125:20.84]I know I could.
[125:28.93]Look, that was the difference?
[125:31.57]That's not much of a difference.
[125:33.03]I need my bike.
[125:40.83]Oh, fuck.
[125:41.99]Was my bike behind me the whole time?
[125:51.91]No, I'm not doing it again.
[125:52.87]It's not gonna be a third encore.
[125:56.18]No, it was right here.
[125:56.86]Okay.
[126:02.80]Alright, we're good.
[126:08.46]Let's move on.
[126:14.46]Wow, what the hell?
[126:17.76]Can I climb this?
[126:21.43]You wouldn't put a tree bent over like this if I couldn't just tightrope on it, right?
[126:25.42]I guess so.
[126:33.15]Gunfire.
[126:33.63]Does that mean anything?
[126:40.02]Who's shooting?
[126:57.82]Oh, that's the motorcycle doing that.
[127:07.65]I'm out of gas.
[127:11.31]Mechanics can repair or refuel your bike for a fee.
[127:13.65]The price adds up, so take care of your bike when you can.
[127:17.53]While your bike is idle, you can walk it backward or forward.
[127:20.64]If you're trying to be quiet or you're out of gas, you can walk your bike around as long as the path isn't too steep.
[127:38.74]How do I walk it?
[127:44.62]No!
[127:46.10]I have to walk the bike!
[127:48.48]No, I'm sorry, I have to... Leave me alone!
[127:58.39]I don't want anything...
[128:16.09]They're still fucking chasing me.
[128:17.33]I'm out of stamina.
[128:18.07]Alright, I have to... desperate.
[128:30.92]Please, just leave me alone.
[128:31.86]I don't want to kill any... I don't want to kill you!
[128:45.70]I have to.
[128:46.04]I have to.
[128:48.76]Unfortunately, I have to.
[128:49.60]Oh my god, he's faster than I can aim.
[128:57.13]You leaving?
[129:00.29]The stick aiming is slower than he can move.
[129:04.49]What the fuck?
[129:06.10]No way, dude!
[129:08.18]Oh my god!
[129:17.70]Alright, let me walk the bike.
[129:20.66]How do I walk the bike?
[129:23.42]Did it tell me a button combination?
[129:26.56]No, I'm out in front of the coin-operated toy in front of Walmart.
[129:38.92]It's too steep.
[129:41.90]No, it's not.
[129:48.02]No, I'm good.
[129:50.72]I'm on my tricycle.
[129:59.14]I see a gas station, I'm fine.
[130:07.59]On the road, where it's safe.
[130:12.15]And then I can just glide.
[130:13.13]Yeah, now I can just glide.
[130:14.03]I'm just coasting.
[130:14.75]Cool gameplay.
[130:42.32]I'll get there eventually.
[130:43.51]What happens if I leave the bike?
[130:47.81]Can I get the bike back eventually?
[130:49.35]Or is it one of those scenarios where I have to keep it with me?
[130:51.27]St.
[130:51.49]John to Copeland's camp.
[130:53.17]It's done.
[130:54.03]The radio tower's locked down and I've restored your radio uplink.
[130:57.83]Alright, here we go.
[130:59.05]Copy that.
[131:00.57]You may not see the value in St.
[131:02.30]John, but Radio Free Oregon is the only thing keeping us from turning into savages.
[131:08.94]A wheelchair would be faster.
[131:09.86]No.
[131:09.98]I'm just walking around.
[131:10.58]There's gotta be gas in here.
[131:11.52]There's gonna be gas.
[131:12.38]Gas?
[131:12.58]Come on.
[131:13.62]Ooh, fire axe.
[131:54.04]Can I craft gas?
[131:59.74]I'm not sure if I can craft... Can I craft?
[132:02.09]That's just a tractor.
[132:06.83]Pipe bombs.
[132:09.43]Pipe bomb, huh?
[132:10.43]Where did I get these?
[132:13.51]Holding L2 and aim to press the throw.
[132:16.90]Well...
[132:36.98]Is that gonna explode?
[132:46.34]Hey somebody's hit!
[132:55.41]It had nothing to do with the pipe bomb!
[133:11.67]I'm not unkillable.
[133:17.97]See, I can still play on normal.
[133:24.30]Do I have gas?
[133:27.82]Hey, hey, wait, wait, why am I already in combat?
[133:37.51]I can't die on the bike.
[133:39.05]That was a fucking marionette on my leg.
[133:42.15]Alright, here we go.
[134:04.65]Boozman, you awake?
[134:06.33]I'm heading to that camp you spotted north of the mountain.
[134:10.02]Maybe you should stop screaming shit and attracting people.
[134:13.26]It might be an ambush camp.
[134:17.16]Yeah, you just heard gunshots.
[134:20.28]I think they're shooting at me.
[134:23.05]I might be mistaken, though.
[134:26.99]Boozman, you were right.
[134:28.69]They set up one of the railroad tracks.
[134:32.28]No no no stop stop stop stop you're getting stuck stop getting stuck
[135:17.07]Okay, can I please just get out of here?
[135:24.77]He shot me.
[135:26.31]Why did he shoot me?
[135:40.05]I'm about to roll up in there and just start swinging.
[135:46.47]Alright, let me search.
[135:47.17]I gotta, I gotta... Just go, go, go, go!
[136:03.36]Just walk it this way.
[136:04.14]Who cares?
[136:04.60]I don't care.
[136:28.27]walking around.
[136:29.49]Not anymore.
[136:38.63]Oh, shit!
[136:39.37]Come on!
[136:43.14]Where are you, asshole?
[137:00.82]He has one of those too!
[137:01.56]Like a bear trap.
[137:14.26]What?
[137:32.54]Can he go in this?
[137:38.24]Just put it under him.
[137:46.78]Wait!
[137:46.98]Hey!
[137:47.40]How did he not go on the ground and catch my leg?
[138:00.85]Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[138:04.68]Oh my god, how do I have another one?
[138:08.07]Plus three bear trap, plus four bear trap, plus five, six, seven, eight, I just get infinite bear traps.
[138:35.80]I could sell these too.
[138:44.16]He's duping.
[138:45.70]He's resorted to duping.
[138:56.37]Alright, I'll do it with 50.
[139:04.92]50 is gonna be like 5 grand.
[139:06.22]Okay.
[139:19.42]Where's bear trap?
[139:32.96]So I don't have any.
[139:34.94]How do I not have any?
[139:38.76]Is it plus 50?
[139:39.30]He's got me flanked!
[140:06.07]Step in it!
[140:10.11]No!
[140:11.21]You're not gonna ru- Oh fuck, I have no ammo.
[140:22.07]Oh, you dick.
[140:23.73]Pick it up.
[140:50.33]You're talking about me?
[140:51.63]Yeah, nice job, man!
[140:52.83]Kill him!
[140:59.69]That guy sucked.
[141:00.29]He owed me 20 bucks!
[141:00.97]Alright, there's only one guy left, alright?
[141:13.40]This guy right here is two.
[141:15.74]We're gonna kill the guy with the handgun.
[141:21.92]Okay, give me the fucking bear trap I have to do this it's so important
[142:05.37]Where'd he go?
[142:07.36]Is he behind?
[142:07.70]Where is he?
[142:09.44]Oh, fuck, he's right there.
[142:17.72]Come on, do it.
[142:19.00]Just come over here.
[142:20.50]I need to see this.
[142:22.34]If it's possible.
[142:23.86]If not, then who cares, right?
[142:28.33]If I'm hidden for long and I feel like he comes out...
[142:31.49]Because he can't see me.
[142:34.79]Come on, come out.
[142:41.86]Oh, fuck.
[142:42.70]He's going, he's wrapping the other way.
[142:43.64]Give me, hold on.
[142:45.96]I'll take this.
[142:47.34]Where is he?
[142:47.62]He's right there.
[142:48.50]I don't think he knows where I am.
[142:54.10]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[142:55.20]Okay, here we go, ready?
[143:03.18]Oh my god, which way is he going?
[143:20.57]I haven't moved from this spot.
[143:21.49]How would you not know where I was?
[143:22.43]This is our opportunity.
[143:25.23]Here it comes.
[143:32.66]Should I just sneak up behind him?
[143:34.16]Okay, here's the plan.
[143:35.16]Ready?
[143:36.82]The plan is... Throw a rock.
[143:39.94]Sneak up behind him.
[143:46.91]He's not listening to the rock?
[143:50.61]I can't tell if he's... What's he doing?
[143:52.43]He's so erratic right now.
[143:59.74]He's not listening anymore.
[144:00.78]Okay, I'm going to try something.
[144:08.41]One, two, three.
[144:10.59]I don't know where he went.
[144:19.19]Where'd he go?
[144:20.85]Where the fuck did he go?
[144:22.13]Where did he go?
[144:23.09]Where did he go?
[144:26.55]Is he behind me?
[144:31.30]Where did he go?
[144:32.48]Is he behind the tent?
[144:53.41]God damn it.
[144:57.45]All right, well I tried, I tried.
[144:59.19]Oh fuck, I don't wanna do this again.
[145:03.13]Okay, I'm just gonna do this as fast as possible now.
[145:05.15]Find out when I get there.
[145:08.70]Dig it out.
[145:19.32]Hold on, I'll get it.
[145:20.00]Just wait.
[145:20.30]I'm gonna do it really fast.
[145:21.28]I'm gonna make sure I get this done, like, right now.
[145:22.88]Oh, I can't even go back.
[145:24.16]You have a shotgun!
[145:49.46]There's no way.
[145:53.14]No, fuck!
[146:09.62]What?
[146:11.00]No!
[146:11.62]No, take it seriously, please!
[146:15.86]Heal!
[146:16.76]Heal!
[146:17.66]Heal!
[146:18.41]Heal!
[146:19.11]Heal!
[146:19.51]Wait.
[146:47.84]in time.
[146:49.58]He's still, oh no.
[146:52.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[146:55.26]I went into the trap.
[147:07.05]What trap?
[147:08.65]I put the other one down to my left.
[147:10.49]I picked, didn't I pick that one?
[147:14.67]Here we go.
[147:15.65]This is for real this time.
[147:19.12]I always tend to pay attention to the guy that was on the cliff.
[147:27.34]I know I put the one down to my left, but I didn't pick the one up to my right?
[147:30.82]No, I want to go up here.
[147:34.00]What's with every game nowadays?
[147:36.04]Your hitbox is like five people wide.
[147:40.42]I want to go over here.
[147:41.78]It's like, you just want to run out here, all the way over here, and then stop?
[147:46.57]All right, here we go.
[147:47.13]Fucking mad because bad.
[147:48.97]Mad because bad.
[147:50.04]Mad because bad.
[147:56.47]Thank god I slid through it.
[147:57.85]I'll save it for later.
[148:24.14]What the hell?
[148:27.56]What the hell?
[148:27.92]What is this thing over here?
[148:28.76]There's no trap.
[148:35.38]Don't worry.
[148:41.44]Oh my fucking god.
[148:42.92]Now you have shotguns.
[148:43.95]Now you're shooting the shotguns with ease.
[148:52.55]I'll take that.
[148:54.86]No, give me the... They just always appear behind me.
[149:11.09]Okay.
[149:12.71]So... I need to stop fucking around.
[149:46.98]I have one bullet left.
[150:01.08]Dude, how many people are in this camp?
[150:28.95]How many bullets do I have?
[150:29.83]Is there ammo in here?
[150:30.49]What am I doing?
[150:34.24]No, I don't want this.
[150:35.80]I don't have ammo.
[150:48.03]What happened?
[150:48.75]Did I... Alright.
[150:50.19]I'm about sick of my incompetence here.
[150:56.49]What is... Yes, they set up on the railroad track.
[150:59.35]Okay.
[150:59.49]Kill everyone.
[151:02.59]And I...
[151:17.91]Give me my binoculars.
[151:25.19]I wanna, like, mark them.
[151:27.51]Give me my binoculars.
[151:28.95]Why can I not use my binoculars to mark people?
[151:31.59]They made such a big deal of that.
[151:51.74]No, I want the rock.
[151:55.84]Alright, what the fuck are you doing?
[151:59.19]Category distraction.
[152:00.89]Put the... What the fuck are you doing?
[152:02.55]Put the rock on!
[152:03.39]I want the rock!
[152:08.11]What the hell is going on?
[152:15.17]Do I not have any more rocks?
[152:25.86]Alright.
[152:26.60]Somebody's got to explain to me why I can't select the rock.
[152:40.39]It doesn't like me.
[152:41.99]I think I'm just going to go... I'm just killing them.
[152:43.89]Like, we're just going to kill them.
[152:45.18]I'm just going to kill them.
[152:45.80]I just have to make this... They're all right here.
[152:47.08]Watch this.
[152:47.44]Ready?
[152:47.70]I'm going to get one shot here.
[152:49.40]Kill.
[152:50.82]Dead.
[152:51.36]No, I hit him right in the head, though.
[153:01.72]Oh my god.
[153:12.95]If I just could put my fucking rocks on.
[153:32.99]I'm gonna make these count.
[153:34.73]Dammit.
[153:38.57]I'm gonna get closer.
[154:16.91]My God!
[154:24.96]Should've seen that coming.
[154:50.07]You sound like you're having fun.
[155:02.16]I am, actually.
[155:02.90]I have to keep Boozer alive.
[155:06.54]Unless I have to go back and walk my car.
[155:26.25]Boozer, he's done.
[155:28.09]Squad of camp.
[155:29.61]They won't be doing any more killing on O'Leary Mountain.
[155:33.52]Good.
[155:35.26]Deke, I should have been there.
[155:38.85]Another bear trap joke.
[155:40.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[155:43.28]Jeremy's fuming, dude.
[155:44.26]He's fuming.
[155:44.72]He's fuming.
[156:02.78]Let's go.
[156:03.24]There's no gas down there?
[156:04.98]Out of nowhere.
[156:06.16]Map.
[156:06.88]Where are we going?
[156:07.46]Storylines.
[156:09.43]You story progress, view gameplay rewards, and activate missions.
[156:31.78]So, Crazy Willy's Infestation, World's End, or Out of Chasing Leon, Out of Nowhere.
[156:40.23]Search the Pioneer Cemetery for Leon's drug stash.
[156:43.90]That's the one we're going to do.
[156:47.14]God damn it, I have to... 786 meters this way.
[156:55.17]Just give me some full-blown momentum.
[156:56.73]There's no gas down here.
[156:58.81]Let me just check.
[157:17.25]Better get walking.
[157:18.51]Yeah, I know.
[157:19.51]Better start moving.
[157:20.59]I can't, like, dump that in the tank?
[157:36.88]Imagine unironically thinking you were a GTA character.
[157:42.77]People living on the streets in boxes and tents because they couldn't afford the American dream.
[157:49.23]Some of those good people fought for this very country, only to have the biggest room ever.
[157:55.01]Maybe.
[157:56.45]PTSD doesn't stand for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[158:01.29]It stands for put them soldiers down.
[158:05.29]Nah, I don't think so, Cope.
[158:06.69]Not today.
[158:07.15]Alright, I need to go.
[158:09.55]Here we go.
[158:09.95]I see a car.
[158:10.71]I see a gas station.
[158:11.73]We just have to coast our way into it.
[158:14.36]Gas station right there.
[158:15.82]Cars.
[158:16.92]What the fuck?
[158:19.96]What was that?
[158:20.60]Why?
[158:20.74]What?
[158:20.98]I needed the gas.
[158:21.62]Who is it?
[158:22.24]Sniper?
[158:22.48]Sniper?
[158:35.67]What in the fucking name of God is happening?
[158:47.88]Give me that thing.
[158:49.80]Oh fuck, I have no more.
[158:56.77]Please, please, please, please, please, please heal.
[159:08.15]I don't understand why somebody just drove a flaming car down at me.
[159:14.79]Where was the car?
[159:17.41]What was the set?
[159:18.27]They just came out of nowhere.
[159:24.43]Some guns are so powerful that shots can pierce through multiple enemies with one round.
[159:28.70]Try lining up multiple enemies.
[159:29.98]Okay.
[159:31.82]A man come in.
[159:33.14]Drugged.
[159:33.48]Out of his mind.
[159:34.46]Shot the place up.
[159:35.56]Then he just took off.
[159:38.06]Give me my bike back.
[159:38.92]I needed that gas that was in this car.
[159:40.84]Alive.
[159:41.00]I have one bullet in this.
[159:41.96]I better be ready.
[159:43.60]Alright, let's get it up.
[160:10.41]How's this thing doing?
[160:11.97]You can't boost without equipping your bike with nitrous.
[160:15.73]Thanks.
[160:19.66]Alright.
[160:20.88]Let's go.
[160:21.26]I can't believe there's no gas over here.
[160:32.09]I'm gonna check down there.
[160:35.69]There has to be gas over here.
[160:36.75]Has to be.
[160:37.07]Look at... It's like a bunch of big gas tanks right there.
[160:47.03]Gas?
[160:52.67]Gas.
[160:53.43]Give me something to gas.
[160:55.64]Anything.
[160:57.54]Please.
[161:07.73]Gas.
[161:12.25]Gas.
[161:13.31]Bruh.
[161:13.97]No, no gas.
[161:20.38]Are you serious?
[161:31.03]It's just like lighter fluid.
[161:32.19]It's not gas.
[161:34.97]Oh, found it.
[161:36.47]Thank God.
[161:42.18]Fill it up and get me out of here.
[161:54.69]Fill it up!
[161:59.57]Alright, repair the bike, because I just got run over.
[162:05.21]Finally.
[162:05.61]It's gonna feel so good to actually be able to ride this thing again.
[162:12.17]Feels so different.
[162:18.37]Let's go.
[162:18.69]Nitrous, too.
[162:19.55]Right up here.
[162:22.51]Alright, clear the logging camp infestation zone.
[162:45.53]You just ran two stops out.
[162:48.87]That's fine.
[162:49.35]There's nobody here.
[162:49.99]I feel like it's just... Yeah, let's just... I'm cutting through here.
[163:02.50]I'm not gonna follow the road.
[163:03.92]The GPS in this game is dumb.
[163:06.38]It's a post-apocalyptic world.
[163:08.83]You don't have to follow the roads.
[163:21.38]shit can I jump it this is radio free oregon the truth shall set you free this earth is a gift for us all to use as we see fit to provide for ourselves and our families I'm not saying this it's the lord that gave us dominion over it
[163:43.52]But that wasn't enough for some men.
[163:45.69]They wanted more.
[163:47.45]When our fuel got low, they jacked up the prices so they could consolidate power into their own hands.
[163:54.39]So, we wanted to build dams for electricity.
[163:57.87]But their precious runs of salmon... Coke, Coke, Coke, shut the hell up.
[164:01.66]Return?
[164:02.06]What do you mean?
[164:02.48]Return to shore?
[164:06.18]What?
[164:09.86]What?
[164:18.75]you you can't be in water for more than three seconds so you drown closed world game coin it that's a new phrase man why can't you go in the water I mean very clearly I could go in the water there's even a swimming animation
[164:53.90]That's really odd.
[164:57.21]If you're gonna have a swimming animation in the game, what's the point of making it so you can swim for three seconds and die?
[165:07.69]Is this gonna happen again?
[165:10.36]Is it gonna trigger the random event?
[165:12.70]If I go over here?
[165:13.82]No, they're dead.
[165:18.38]That's weird.
[165:19.34]That's very weird.
[165:23.25]But, alright, good to know.
[165:30.30]So don't go in... What about the bike?
[165:33.00]I want to test something here.
[165:33.74]Hold on.
[165:38.78]So the bike can swim, but I can't.
[165:41.41]What if I go in a little deeper?
[165:42.65]I'm just testing.
[166:05.74]Can't get back on the bike.
[166:13.26]Um... Okay.
[166:14.67]Got it.
[166:17.15]Are we sure?
[166:27.26]Well, I'm not getting dragged under by something.
[166:37.19]You can retrieve the bike.
[166:38.31]Oh, that's good to know.
[166:41.31]Taken by the ground demon.
[166:44.73]I would believe that at this point.
[166:50.02]That's so odd.
[166:51.40]But why?
[166:53.32]Is this clear?
[166:54.04]Okay, back in the day, when you went into water, you just instantly died.
[166:58.38]You sunk through the earth and it instantly killed you.
[167:04.77]I'm treading water.
[167:05.65]Is it a weight thing?
[167:08.11]Alright, I'm gonna make... What the fuck, man?
[167:27.23]I'm at Corpse Disposal Site 13-Beta.
[167:28.43]Supervising me.
[167:29.11]Unloading a disposal cargo.
[167:30.53]You never get used to the smell, do you?
[167:43.34]Trains have been running non-stop.
[167:47.77]All the current sites are almost to capacity.
[167:50.07]I've put in wrecks to open up more thorough land for the wooden counters in DC, and I've stopped returning my calls.
[167:57.40]I gotta go around.
[168:12.75]How do I turn this off?
[168:15.81]This is the weirdest, longest voicemail I've ever received.
[168:26.34]What audiobook did I download?
[168:37.05]What is going on over here?
[168:42.73]Is this a random encounter?
[168:48.46]Water can?
[168:52.02]What is it?
[168:53.94]Upgrade?
[168:58.40]um no it's tracks okay let's take a look around oh look he dropped something okay let's see a drug vent what are these whatever they're called survival hit plants can be easily uh
[169:26.61]Where is it now?
[169:27.30]We lost the trail.
[169:32.14]Over here?
[169:36.79]What is it?
[169:39.87]Is that him?
[169:40.43]Should I be sneaking?
[169:56.43]What exactly am I looking for here?
[169:57.70]Am I looking for this person?
[170:05.48]What am I looking for you for?
[170:10.21]Found you.
[170:10.93]Oh, it was a bounty.
[170:13.43]Okay, I get it.
[170:36.40]Don't die from this, please.
[170:37.30]Okay, well, got the bounty.
[170:49.41]I would take point-and-click Batman over this.
[170:56.45]Come on, like, just give it a little bit.
[170:59.21]We're only gonna do this for, like, a stream, or maybe another one.
[171:01.84]No, we're not.
[171:02.30]We'll do this, this is day gone.
[171:04.74]One day gone.
[171:12.53]I gotta burn him out.
[171:13.35]I gotta make it safer to ride.
[171:14.83]What?
[171:14.95]What does that mean?
[171:18.59]I gotta burn him out?
[171:21.55]What am I burning out?
[171:23.95]Oh, I missed the... It was three out of three.
[171:25.72]Whatever.
[171:26.00]I don't want to do that.
[171:35.96]Water!
[171:36.24]It's water!
[171:36.62]No, it's not.
[171:37.08]It's a road.
[171:37.68]Okay.
[171:49.29]Pulling the camera all the way out here so we can wait till nighttime.
[172:00.67]Enter Pioneer Cemetery.
[172:05.85]Find the statue.
[172:23.62]I can't open that.
[172:26.58]I think it's going to alert the horde.
[172:30.58]Don't blink.
[172:39.59]Yeah.
[172:40.15]Scrap.
[172:40.65]Yeah.
[172:43.55]Yeah.
[172:44.65]Scrap.
[172:45.27]Yeah.
[172:50.23]Angel statue.
[172:51.27]Anybody see an angel?
[172:54.59]Angel, angel, angel.
[172:56.31]I don't see an angel, but I see this.
[173:01.97]Angel.
[173:05.82]Just you.
[173:06.70]Oh, hey, thanks.
[173:08.44]You're such a sweetie.
[173:15.52]No angel here.
[173:20.05]No ban.
[173:21.15]Why would I ban you for saying that?
[173:22.29]That was such a sweet thing to say.
[173:23.69]Leaving the mission zone.
[173:36.32]Leave the zone.
[173:37.16]No, I'm not going to leave the zone.
[173:41.24]I'm enjoying my closed world game, okay?
[173:55.62]Can I go in here?
[174:03.17]Could it be over this way or something?
[174:04.99]I don't know where it would be.
[174:09.97]I have 15 minutes to switch the game.
[174:13.57]There it is.
[174:13.89]Is that an angel?
[174:17.08]Let's see.
[174:17.58]No, I'm not switching the game.
[174:20.58]Weeping angel.
[174:23.27]I'm not... I'm playing this one.
[174:26.30]I'm enjoying my time.
[174:27.58]It's just a fun experience to check it out.
[174:32.62]Oh.
[174:35.08]It... Oh.
[174:39.76]I thought that was a person.
[174:40.87]I was about to go up and sneak and kill this person.
[174:46.91]Hmm.
[174:47.75]Hmm.
[174:53.00]Fucking helicopter?
[174:57.94]Take the cooler.
[174:59.12]What, I got a guy's kidneys?
[175:03.60]Boozer!
[175:04.82]Boozman, are you listening?
[175:06.16]You're not going to believe this.
[175:08.14]I just saw a goddamn chopper.
[175:11.60]Can't climb that.
[175:12.40]A chopper?
[175:13.62]What are you talking about?
[175:14.28]You can't climb this.
[175:15.70]A Nero chopper!
[175:16.96]It just buzzed right over me and acted like I wasn't even there.
[175:21.56]Get off of me I dropped the beer We're gonna get this to the tailgate party
[175:58.40]What are you doing?
[175:58.84]What do you mean?
[175:59.57]What?
[175:59.69]Get it back to the bike?
[176:00.43]To tie Stash to bike.
[176:16.24]Fucking god damn it.
[176:18.22]Wait, what?
[176:19.02]Whose bike is that?
[176:35.02]Why?
[176:35.94]Why?
[176:41.37]I'm not leaving the mission zone, okay?
[176:44.79]I promise you.
[176:54.57]Okay.
[177:00.20]No, if it failed me, I would have changed games.
[177:14.55]we were so close no come on let me just let's see what I can do investigate the helicopter uh what what helicopter
[177:41.91]He's talking to me?
[177:43.15]Who's keeping you hostage to play this?
[177:49.11]Heh heh.
[178:10.53]We all know you're a comedy genius, but I feel like maybe you've tapped this game for all it's worth.
[178:18.35]You guys don't have very much confidence at all.
[178:29.76]Now that the military's involved, let me, hold on, let me at least just... Come on, this game's 60 bucks.
[178:39.93]Dude, I bought the digital deluxe version too.
[178:41.89]This was like 90 bucks.
[178:45.69]They're immune to attacks.
[178:52.03]Okay.
[178:54.07]Now I'm getting where you're coming from, guys.
[178:56.89]Now I see what you're getting.
[178:58.01]I see what you're talking about here.
[179:00.67]I didn't see it before, now I do.
[179:07.48]I get it now.
[179:10.00]No, I didn't buy the digital deluxe.
[179:11.30]Why would I ever do that?
[179:19.20]No, I get... I know what you mean.
[179:24.11]I didn't... For a sec... Okay, I'm gonna line this up and get a collateral here.
[179:28.41]Let's try to get like... Let me try to get like four people in one shot.
[179:32.61]Stop.
[179:47.63]Don't look over.
[179:48.03]What the hell are you doing?
[179:48.73]Go investigate the rock.
[179:51.67]I want to line up like a quad.
[179:53.27]I can't use any weapons.
[180:07.77]Okay, I... I can't kill anyone.
[180:19.11]I can't attack anyone.
[180:20.57]Not even stealth kill.
[180:22.21]I just... Oh no, it's one of these...
[180:38.76]Fucking close, goddamn.
[180:40.08]All right, all right, okay, all right, all right.
[180:52.47]Listen, all right, just everybody relax.
[180:54.75]I know, I understand.
[180:55.97]Just hold on.
[180:57.65]I... I've seen the light.
[181:00.52]I've seen it.
[181:02.72]Yes, I can't even... I thought it meant, like, melee attack.
[181:05.42]But what is this shit?
[181:07.64]Why would you show me that thumbnail of a guy being stabbed in the neck for this mission?
[181:13.18]What the- why?
[181:13.98]I thought I saw the knife!
[181:15.19]Alright, so- oh man.
[181:34.53]Is this hidden?
[181:35.81]This counts as grass, right?
[181:44.00]Are you getting hungry?
[181:55.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[181:55.93]No, I'm fucking dumb!
[182:04.18]My flashlight is on!
[182:23.76]What?
[182:24.58]What the hell am I doing?
[182:26.73]Why am I reading this?
[182:40.32]What did the researcher go up there?
[183:06.01]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[183:08.17]In the helicopter?
[183:08.77]Do I have to take the helicopter?
[183:12.11]I don't know.
[183:12.47]I don't know.
[183:12.85]Just throw... Do I have to go in the helicopter?
[183:22.93]Where is he?
[183:27.77]I don't... I don't know where... This way?
[183:36.68]In the helicopter.
[183:38.00]Are you sure?
[183:38.28]I don't know if you're sure about that.
[183:39.94]Hold on.
[183:46.30]One.
[183:47.62]Two.
[183:54.36]I'm luring him.
[184:00.63]I'm luring him to me.
[184:08.88]Anybody hear any sound?
[184:10.82]Helicopter, go.
[184:13.66]You guys lied.
[184:38.90]Other side of the helicopter?
[184:40.16]Oh, fuck.
[184:56.52]I'm just waiting for it to be like, bing!
[184:58.54]You OK?
[185:11.53]Hugo's probably got a proximity alarm.
[185:13.85]Better not try to climb inside.
[185:17.55]Okay, well I just tried.
[185:28.59]Other side!
[185:29.91]Stop!
[185:44.33]It's not gonna- there's no alarm in there!
[185:47.82]It's at the back.
[185:48.86]It's not at the back.
[185:49.78]That's a tail.
[185:50.50]I have to find the guy in the white suit.
[185:56.82]It's this way.
[185:57.30]You guys lied.
[185:57.80]I have to just go this way.
[185:58.52]Here we go.
[185:58.90]One, two, three, go.
[186:00.56]Wait.
[186:21.50]Where'd the doctor go?
[186:22.38]This way somewhere, right?
[186:23.94]Oh my god, damn it.
[186:31.25]I swear to god if I have to go to the tail... Is it that guy right there?
[186:50.66]Down that way.
[186:54.41]There were people talking right next to the helicopter.
[186:56.39]Yeah, that's... I know, but I... I feel like I can... Can I just go down that way?
[187:01.36]Okay, stay low, stay low.
[187:09.80]Stay low.
[187:10.20]Okay, stay low.
[187:10.86]What are you talking about?
[187:11.66]I am.
[187:20.16]Do I... I feel like I have to... Hold on.
[187:24.04]Let me see if anyone's lying to me.
[187:43.18]You have to enter the helicopter from the top.
[187:45.22]It's not the helicopter.
[187:48.82]They went uphill on that west side.
[187:50.98]Yeah, like up here, right?
[187:54.72]Hold on.
[187:58.17]Up like this way?
[187:59.05]No, that's where I... West, not north.
[188:06.27]Okay, I'm gonna go...
[188:22.77]Just go west.
[188:23.65]I'm just gonna go west.
[188:24.45]I'm just gonna be tactical about this and just go.
[188:25.97]What?
[188:39.66]What do you mean something moved?
[188:41.99]Hide this bush quick!
[189:11.17]Up here.
[189:15.77]Go north-south!
[189:19.57]Oh, fucking god damn forced stealth game.
[189:22.35]There's nothing worse.
[189:27.43]I'm gonna... I gotta send him that way.
[189:38.22]You, like, go over there.
[189:41.66]Thank you.
[190:16.45]I was going the right way I was everybody just got in my head I was going the right way I was going past the helicopter I was doing it correct and everyone said no you're doing it wrong I was gone and then we're after all I went all the way back around the circle it's over here it's up there
[190:53.86]Please don't turn around!
[190:56.02]Don't turn around!
[190:57.40]I made it.
[190:59.12]Okay, now it's up here.
[191:00.38]They went this way.
[191:03.11]Oh!
[191:21.97]Get the fuck out of here!
[191:23.09]Leave me alone!
[191:23.69]They went right here.
[191:36.38]Oh my god, where do I go?
[191:39.98]No!
[191:40.98]What?
[191:41.36]There's nobody here!
[191:50.99]Where is this guy?
[192:00.54]I already went to the helicopter like three times!
[192:08.05]Is it over... There's a car over here.
[192:09.95]Is it this way?
[192:10.53]I think I was supposed to be tailing somebody.
[192:15.47]Oh.
[192:16.31]My.
[192:17.11]God.
[192:20.54]There's a fucking cave.
[192:23.28]No, there's no cave.
[192:33.45]One of those will fucking distract you.
[192:36.51]In the water?
[192:39.01]Like, down there?
[192:40.01]I went over there, it was nothing.
[192:45.61]Is it like a little spot I can go in here?
[192:50.19]Okay, hold on.
[192:52.69]But this just goes back up.
[192:57.76]Somebody open up a goddamn game, Janie.
[193:24.63]The map has a quest point.
[193:33.10]But... But what?
[193:35.82]No!
[193:37.64]This is out of the mission zone!
[193:39.53]This is out of bounds!
[193:43.33]The mission ends if I walk out here!
[193:59.55]Hold on.
[193:59.79]For the start of the mission, don't throw any rocks.
[194:01.84]Just follow the guy in the white suit.
[194:18.17]Alright, I just follow the guy in the white suit.
[194:23.31]Quit the game.
[194:23.79]No, no, no.
[194:25.18]I can't let it beat me.
[194:26.08]I have to win.
[194:31.71]Throw rocks at the guy with the suit.
[194:36.17]All right, where... Hold on, wait, wait, but where... Where's the guy in the suit?
[194:40.76]It keeps spawning me.
[194:41.70]It's soft-locking me here.
[194:45.12]Where is this person?
[194:50.62]Yeah, I hear you.
[194:51.04]Let me guess.
[194:52.86]You'd rather be in the film that way.
[194:59.24]Dude, the whole game is gray.
[195:01.10]I can't see anything.
[195:14.92]Go west?
[195:16.40]Like, that's... Okay, here I go.
[195:27.64]This is gonna lead back up to the spawn.
[195:34.28]Up the hill with the fence.
[195:35.41]No, that's bullshit because look!
[195:37.93]This is the start of the game!
[195:45.93]This is the beginning of the game!
[195:48.45]I've...
[196:32.56]Go north.
[196:33.44]Go north.
[196:34.22]You went everywhere but the right direction.
[196:36.72]Why do I have to follow the straight line path in an open world game?
[196:47.42]I can go left from here.
[196:52.80]The other fence.
[196:58.81]Look le- I mean, like, you're talking about overhea- Let me get the fucking binoculars here.
[197:02.13]Like, eek, eek, mark this guy.
[197:03.37]Like, you're talking about this way.
[197:06.41]What do you mean the other left?
[197:13.09]This is left!
[197:17.24]This way, like just go straight this way.
[197:19.30]Okay, where that little pixel is pointing is where you want me to go, right?
[197:22.84]Alright, okay, hold on a minute.
[197:30.81]I'm looking at the helicopter right now.
[197:32.61]To the left of this helicopter or to the right of this helicopter?
[197:41.29]Hard left.
[197:43.65]So this way.
[197:46.82]I don't know.
[197:47.96]Yes.
[197:48.38]No.
[197:48.72]Left.
[197:49.02]The back.
[197:49.92]Left.
[197:50.38]Left of the back.
[197:52.24]There's a cave right next to you.
[197:56.64]Where's there a cave?
[197:58.97]There's a cave.
[198:01.25]Where's the cave?
[198:02.65]I don't see a cave.
[198:08.45]I'm going for the... I'm going this way.
[198:09.73]Everyone said this way.
[198:10.56]Hard left.
[198:26.18]Give me area, give me!
[198:30.84]There's nobody in here!
[198:35.31]There's nobody inside the cave!
[198:49.63]There he is!
[198:50.01]There's a scientist!
[198:54.67]Going too far from the researchers?
[198:56.11]What are you talking about?
[198:57.07]He's fro- I've been... I've been far away from the researchers.
[199:14.41]No 2-0-0-0.
[199:16.02]Thought I heard something.
[199:23.61]Hold on.
[199:24.35]We can be friends now, can't we?
[199:38.36]Wait, now it wants me to clear the camp?
[199:41.92]I have to sit here and listen.
[199:43.71]Shit, where was I?
[199:57.90]No, stop it.
[199:58.38]Just let it in.
[200:15.61]According to the motion sensor planted by Lieutenant O'Brien, approximately 447 subjects have entered the cave this morning.
[200:24.60]Recommend sending a follow-up team sometime after 1900 hours to assess the cave's interior and further assessments.
[200:30.00]Spent the whole day on this mission.
[200:31.66]A whole day gone.
[200:34.32]Do I follow the researcher to continue eavesdropping?
[200:38.95]Stay close and out of sight.
[200:40.45]Oh, come on.
[200:41.53]Fucking hell.
[200:46.54]I don't- I really don't think anyone, and I mean anyone, that has ever played a video game in their whole life thinks- NO!
[200:59.09]Thinks this is fun!
[201:07.98]Following, force stealth follow and listen to somebody talk.
[201:12.27]Nobody thinks, I don't want to listen to this.
[201:16.19]I'm putting my... We have like decades of video game research and knowledge.
[201:26.72]They made whole games, like some of the Assassin's Creed games were this mission's the whole game.
[201:31.90]And everyone was like, oh here comes another escort, walk behind him and listen mission.
[201:36.40]High Desert Grotto, now designated Site 15.
[201:39.66]Trampling up grasses and plants at the entrance and the presence of footprints, see attached photos, indicate the site has been used for some time.
[201:46.67]Must be nice and cozy in there.
[201:50.13]According to the motion sensor planted by Lieutenant O'Brien, approximately 447 subjects have entered the cave this morning.
[201:58.87]Recommend sending a
[202:01.46]No, I can stomach this, but I can't... They have to have forced stealth because you have to listen to this.
[202:07.82]You can't just throw an axe at somebody's head.
[202:09.83]We have to hear this.
[202:10.85]We gotta go right here.
[202:26.14]And I asked if you were going in.
[202:28.35]Didn't say I was.
[202:30.07]These subjects are not sleeping.
[202:31.45]They're hibernating.
[202:33.01]Ever woken up a hibernating bear?
[202:35.37]No.
[202:37.03]Ever woken up a hibernating tree?
[202:38.09]Dude, I'm going to throw a rock as hard as I can at this person's face.
[202:41.23]I was one of the survivors at the White King mine.
[202:43.93]Jesus.
[202:45.55]Someone tear my buddy apart like he was peeling a banana.
[202:48.83]These suits protect you from a lot of shit.
[202:51.67]Quick, quick.
[202:52.25]No.
[202:55.06]No quitting.
[202:56.48]Hurry up, go back to DOS.
[203:02.20]No, he's not seeing me.
[203:12.53]That light is really close.
[203:13.91]Please don't see me.
[203:16.17]Okay, return to your bike.
[203:17.33]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[203:18.41]Get me to my bike.
[203:22.49]What's the fastest way to get over there?
[203:23.69]I didn't mark anybody.
[203:28.16]Um, shit.
[203:29.00]No, God!
[203:31.82]God!
[203:32.50]Why is this guy just here?
[203:34.61]Don't make me do it all again.
[203:40.17]Don't make me do it again.
[203:43.63]Oh, thank you.
[203:56.66]Yeah, I don't want any trouble.
[203:58.81]You saw that.
[204:03.92]You saw me do it.

[204:31.36]Get me back to the bike!
[204:33.68]Oops!

[204:41.72]Oh, no.
[205:07.59]Okay, come on.
[205:08.49]Get me the bike.
[205:14.85]No, he's gonna come over here too, isn't he?
[205:18.26]You stay all the fucking way over there.
[205:20.08]For God's sakes.
[205:27.26]Thank God.
[205:27.76]Get me out.
[205:35.19]Oh my god, it only took like 40 minutes.
[205:38.37]Holy shit.
[205:55.71]Better switch to a better game, or no dessert for you.
[206:03.20]Fuck all the quitters.
[206:04.32]All right, you know that one guy you're right Why is he still playing he admitted it's not I never said it wasn't fun.

[207:03.98]Increase the time that icons display in survival vision.
[207:07.51]Plants are displayed on the minimap.
[207:09.99]Provides a chance to retrieve some bolts that have been... I mean... I guess this one?
[207:25.57]Yeah.
[207:28.04]This one.
[207:39.65]This is not a sponsored stream.
[207:41.79]My contract would have been ripped in half.
[207:47.65]That phone call in the beginning of the stream would have been from the sponsor.
[207:54.52]We're just calling to let you know that the contract's been terminated.
[207:59.04]You said, fuck this dumb stealth mission, and you laughed at something.
[208:03.06]Hello?
[208:03.42]We were there.
[208:05.23]The whole camp was wiped out.
[208:07.75]Now, I know that, but I heard... I went into their LZ, and they... Wait, wait.
[208:13.23]You went into their LZ?
[208:14.83]What the... I'm just listening.
[208:17.91]On the radio.
[208:19.34]Talking about a man named O'Brien.
[208:35.30]You should play Photoshop.
[208:37.54]What do you mean Photoshop?
[208:42.28]I don't know how to use Photoshop that well.
[208:59.73]And he doesn't go off the bike.

[210:57.18]It's three and a half hours in.
[210:58.46]Come on.
[210:59.32]This stream's only gonna be like another three hours long.
[211:02.52]Four hours.
[211:03.38]We gotta stick with this.
[211:12.74]It's the only time you're ever gonna see this game.
[211:15.10]Don't you want to know if you want to buy it?
[211:18.48]I went right through that log.
[211:21.16]Shit.

[212:42.60]I don't know what to say.
[212:43.94]It's freaking out.
[212:45.38]I was gonna say Mario Yahtzee, but that's... Shouldn't have said it.

[213:32.35]That's true.
[213:34.05]And plus, this was what I wanted to do today.
[213:36.98]Look, I'll think about it, okay?
[213:38.04]Here's what's going to happen.
[213:38.64]We're going to play this a little bit more.
[213:41.56]And I'm going to go pee.
[213:43.02]It's three and a half hours.
[213:43.78]I haven't peed yet.
[213:44.54]It's a world record.
[213:52.87]Nobody said that?
[213:53.47]Yes they did.
[213:54.05]Scroll back.

[214:58.18]Can I not move this car?
[215:01.88]I can't move this car.
[215:03.44]No, that's not true.
[215:15.80]I can't move this car.
[215:16.86]No.
[215:17.96]I definitely can.
[215:18.52]I was gonna say, no.
[215:20.86]Obstructed by bike.
[215:24.35]No shit, huh?
[215:35.25]At least let us play with smart click.
[215:40.55]I'll think about it after I pick.
[216:02.71]Think faster!
[216:03.65]Okay, if there's another roadblock, I'm gonna quit the game.
[216:20.27]Good.
[216:20.37]Good.
[216:20.49]Another amount of gas.
[216:36.62]No roadblock.
[216:37.36]We get to stay.
[216:40.87]Boozer, you there?
[216:42.45]Let me at least turn this shit in.
[216:45.31]Hey, I'm here.
[216:47.71]We rode on a farewell.
[216:49.19]The Nero guy, the soldier, whatever the hell he was, who took Sarah.
[216:53.53]Gas?
[216:56.13]He had an ID badge.
[216:57.17]What was the name?
[216:59.87]Oh, Brian.
[217:01.17]You wouldn't shut up about it.
[217:02.75]All the way out to Three-Fingered Jack.
[217:04.50]I'm just running.
[217:05.98]Okay, he's alive, Boozer.
[217:07.44]He's alive.
[217:09.76]What are you talking about?
[217:11.42]We were there.
[217:12.00]The whole camp was wiped out.
[217:14.50]No, I know that, but I heard... Okay, look.
[217:16.88]I'm... What's... What are you doing?
[217:22.14]Why is it doing that?
[217:23.45]Wait, wait.
[217:25.47]You went into their LZ?
[217:27.33]What the...
[217:33.58]How do I call the bike?
[217:34.90]Recover.
[217:36.20]Bike is too far to recover.
[217:37.48]Oh, we're losing internet here.
[217:38.15]Get some sleep.
[217:38.67]Deacon out.
[218:03.13]Check the nerd camp for fuel.
[218:04.15]It's too far now.
[218:05.66]It's too far.
[218:06.18]There's a gas back there.
[218:31.75]Oh, just turn around.
[218:32.49]I can coast.
[218:34.53]Uh-oh.
[218:35.91]Boring, boring, boring streamer.
[218:39.25]No, just wait.
[218:39.77]Wait, just wait.
[218:40.19]Something funny could happen.
[218:41.29]Right here.
[218:41.57]Ready?
[218:55.86]Oh, shit.
[218:56.78]Not even the funny music will make them laugh.
[218:59.18]Freakers, not martyrs.
[219:00.56]Here it is.
[219:03.89]What do you?
[219:04.95]Oh, goddammit.
[219:06.43]Fuse blown.
[219:10.03]Where the hell am I going to get a fuse?
[219:14.35]Shit.
[219:14.99]Wrong way.
[219:17.43]What?
[219:18.54]I just want gas.
[219:19.24]I don't care about anything else here.
[219:20.88]Power's off.
[219:22.00]Figures.
[219:26.47]One of these days I'm just gonna turn the stream on during this.
[219:28.45]I'm just gonna be making balloon animals.
[219:32.13]Hey, the game sucks, like, boring.
[219:33.75]Come on, play something else.
[219:34.59]Oh, shit.
[219:34.99]I'm gonna turn the camera on.
[219:35.79]Just start making fucking dogs and stuff.
[219:38.19]Alright, we'll find the fuse.
[219:49.36]I just want gas.
[219:56.78]I don't even know how to make balloon animals.
[220:00.77]Thank God.
[220:01.11]All right, the stream can go on.
[220:06.03]It's right there.
[220:06.53]Just give it to me.
[220:08.89]It's right there.
[220:09.45]Just let me, just give it to me.
[220:13.77]I can see it.
[220:14.69]It's right here.
[220:15.89]That's gas, right?
[220:19.43]That's gas, gasoline.
[220:21.27]I'll take it.
[220:35.08]You guys actually have pretty good patience.
[220:36.50]I will give you that.
[220:40.93]We're going for about four hours.
[220:43.47]But it's been fun.
[220:45.29]You guys are really patient.
[220:46.55]What do you mean?
[220:49.55]How are they patient?
[220:50.73]No, we're not.
[220:51.29]No, we don't.
[220:52.63]I'm trying to give you a compliment.
[220:54.31]Now my turn.
[220:54.77]Give me one.
[220:55.07]What do you think?
[220:57.07]Mm-hmm.
[220:59.34]Your turn.
[220:59.78]Mm-hmm.
[221:01.02]Mm-hmm.
[221:08.84]Jump!
[221:12.22]A cool jump!
[221:35.70]Oh shit, not now.
[221:36.68]How did he get down here?
[221:39.53]He's down.
[222:14.71]God damn it.
[222:16.15]My frame rate dropped to like 20 frames a second and I didn't make the jump.
[222:20.40]I'm holding right trigger right now.
[222:24.30]If I don't make it this time... See this slowdown?
[222:27.60]Is it not catching my frames or something?
[222:29.40]No, I'm going to make it this time.
[222:31.74]Why would... Why?
[222:33.87]Why?
[222:37.01]No way.
[222:38.07]I need...
[222:49.66]You telling me I can't make that jump?
[222:51.56]It's like 15 feet.
[222:53.14]It's not even 10 feet.
[222:54.66]I'm hitting that jump.
[222:57.56]I'll show you how.
[222:59.98]You think I give a fuck right now?
[223:01.48]We're hitting that jump and I'm going over it.
[223:03.14]Hold on, I never did finish burning out this nesting zone.
[223:24.77]I did it!
[223:30.41]Oh, Freaker infestations.
[223:31.79]Did you know that the Freaker infestations are highly dangerous areas where Freakers can congregate to build their nest to hibernate during the day?
[223:37.08]Clear all nests to be careful about that.
[223:38.48]By the way, if you need anything else, just let me know.
[223:41.40]I smell a nest.
[223:42.22]It could be right here.
[223:52.16]Oh, I got Freakers!
[223:53.05]How's that, huh?
[223:58.29]Wait, I gotta check these houses, man.
[224:02.90]Hmph!
[224:42.72]Don't grab me.
[224:44.12]And then I gouge his eyes out.
[224:50.10]All right.
[224:52.20]Supplies.
[224:52.80]We're looking for ammo, snacks, bandages, anything of that sort, guys.
[225:00.33]If you see anything, make sure you holler at me.
[225:09.55]And if you see anything, in the comments below, let me know if you see something.
[225:15.95]So, yeah, guys, I was just chilling the other day, and I went to the ice cream store.
[225:20.92]And I got a chocolate ice cream, and I really liked it.
[225:24.28]What's your favorite ice cream?
[225:25.00]Let me know in the comments while I game engagements.
[225:28.63]Oh, okay, let's start the video now.
[225:29.79]So, hey, welcome to another video.
[225:33.99]Where's the...
[225:50.46]Where's my bike?
[225:51.52]What?
[225:52.28]I still have this stupid kidney here.
[225:58.46]Your old videos were that exactly.
[226:01.23]I'm able to look back and say, I've grown.
[226:05.45]Alright, that was weird.
[226:11.67]Because right when the internet died, this popped up.
[226:20.58]The second the internet tanked, I got like, hey, make sure you use your scrap on your bike.
[226:27.70]What the fuck was that?
[226:31.86]What is happening?
[226:37.36]I don't know!
[226:38.35]Get off of me!
[226:42.45]Gouge your eyes out!
[226:51.38]Why did I fly off the bike?
[227:07.31]I got clotheslined?
[227:08.49]Oh, I can repair the engine.
[227:11.52]This thing's fucked.
[227:13.48]Let's see.
[227:27.52]Get on.
[227:29.60]Get on.
[227:32.34]Driver location, price on your head.
[227:37.75]It was a tripwire.
[227:38.77]Oh, that's pretty clever.
[227:50.02]Engine is fucked, dude.
[227:51.12]Yeah, I know.
[227:53.32]I pulled over, though, and I fixed it.
[228:03.94]It's like a dirt bike path that I'm riding with a giant Harley motorcycle.
[228:11.29]Wow.
[228:11.71]There's just a fight here?
[228:14.26]Who's fighting?
[228:33.22]Will these guys be my friends?
[228:40.46]I wonder if I... Are these guys friendly?
[228:45.03]Alright, let's fight them together.
[228:45.97]There you go.
[228:54.87]Nice work.
[228:58.23]You and me are now a team.
[229:28.38]It was his fault.
[229:29.82]He dove into my bike.
[229:40.60]Three-point turn.
[229:43.04]Did he... Wait, did he turn into... I don't... Where did these people come from?
[229:53.42]I wonder... There's this thing on the mini-map.
[229:56.56]I wanna read it.
[230:00.81]What does this say?
[230:05.01]Three-fingered jack viewpoint.
[230:06.67]Old hot fingers.
[230:07.69]There's another person up there.
[230:21.42]Who is that?
[230:35.70]Alright, I'm getting the fuck out of this.
[230:39.18]Gimme my bike.
[230:41.90]That guy landed on the crown of his head.
[230:45.57]Oh my god, get away from me!
[230:47.43]That guy landed on- I died.
[230:57.51]Now, uh, now you die.
[231:09.89]stay down okay I'm gonna go look up here because this stuff up here those people were up here hanging out so what was even up here okay nothing nothing at all why was that guy standing up here all right I'm out let's go we're not almost there we're close
[231:41.26]I was supposed to save the guy.
[231:50.65]Well, I mean, he just walked off a cliff.
[231:55.21]I would love to pick those up.
[231:58.09]Yes, this is on PS4.
[231:58.81]This is exclusive to PS4.
[232:00.15]I cannot get this anywhere else.
[232:03.09]And speaking of cannot do anything else, I don't think I can go anywhere else.
[232:06.82]Maybe I can go this way.
[232:15.25]Can I go over this?
[232:17.56]No.
[232:19.84]I was thinking maybe there'd be a jump or something.
[232:24.68]Alright, well I have to go this way.
[232:26.04]I have to do it the right way.
[232:38.75]That's what I'm talking about.
[232:39.69]No, I don't.
[232:40.37]Can you do a wheelie?
[232:41.65]I don't think you can.
[232:43.23]Not that I've been able to do.
[232:44.48]Cave.
[233:10.01]Ah, it's not a cave.
[233:10.75]Shit.
[233:23.19]Can't go over this, I don't think.
[233:24.42]Son of a bitch!
[233:26.04]I can't go over that.
[233:27.18]I can't just break through that and fly off.
[233:30.26]God, that would be so cool, wouldn't it?
[233:31.76]How cool would that be if I could just fly over that?
[233:35.32]Be like... Whoa!
[233:43.73]It'd be cool.
[233:44.23]It would be cool.
[233:50.81]There's no way for me to jump over that.
[233:52.93]I wonder... I'm going the wrong way, but can I not wrap... No, it's a tunnel.
[234:00.57]Turn around.
[234:01.15]I'm not doing another tunnel.
[234:03.37]I'm not getting off the bike three times to push cars.
[234:05.37]We're just gonna go this way, then.
[234:21.65]I feel like the bike doesn't go that fast either.
[234:24.15]You know when you play GTA with your friends in multiplayer?
[234:34.32]And they do this thing where they cover the whole street in cars to try to block the road and fuck everybody?
[234:41.92]Why did somebody do this?
[234:56.15]Because, what about blocking the zombies?
[234:58.53]They can just walk around.
[235:09.16]Just let the engine explode.
[235:10.52]If the engine explodes, then that's the end of this game for me.
[235:15.46]Because then it'll be so humiliating, I'll have to stop playing.
[235:35.30]That's that's not it that's I have two binoculars put the binoculars away if you could that would be fantastic Okay, Terminator
[235:57.01]Goddamn.
[236:05.04]Bulletproof down jackets.
[236:09.18]That's not embarrassing.
[236:10.04]That's I got ambushed.
[236:25.94]Made it.
[236:34.38]Give me the cutscene.
[236:35.20]No.
[236:35.32]I thought it was going to go into a cutscene like it usually does.
[236:41.76]Here we go.
[236:43.84]Jump to fire.
[236:45.62]Nice.
[236:52.50]Let me in.
[236:54.26]Let me in.
[236:56.17]Let me in.
[237:04.70]No fun allowed.
[237:05.44]Alright, I'm gonna turn this in, I'm gonna take a piss, and we'll come back and figure out what we're gonna do.
[237:34.76]We won?
[237:35.50]What do you mean, we won?
[237:36.74]I have not made a decision yet.
[237:48.05]You can't preemptively say you win while you hold the ball while it's 7-7.
[237:54.51]And you're running into the end zone.
[237:56.75]You're 10 yards away.
[237:58.19]There's two or three people behind you about to tackle you.
[238:00.16]You can't say, we win.
[238:01.76]Because what if you get tackled?
[238:03.30]They're not going to look good.
[238:04.58]I keep telling you, everywhere you look, it's all one giant lava field.
[238:11.32]25 feet, solid rock.
[238:13.57]It'll take jackhammers to... I don't need a lecture, goddammit.
[238:18.31]I get it.
[238:20.41]No, you don't.
[238:22.01]But these people are hungry.
[238:24.59]Don't we have to at least see the 500 zombies?
[238:26.61]Remember E3?
[238:27.33]I don't give a shit.
[238:33.04]When are we going to get the E3 moment where there's like 500 of them chasing us from behind?
[238:36.94]Doesn't that happen?
[238:40.82]But this job's got to get done, whether it takes all goddamn year.
[238:46.42]It's not like we've got somewhere else to be now, do we?
[238:49.30]Wait.
[238:50.94]Not finished.
[238:52.20]We'll make it quick.
[238:52.98]Can we get Al?
[238:53.72]I've got things to do.
[238:55.36]Prippers.
[238:56.60]This morning.
[238:57.68]One of my men spotted a large group of them coming over the pass.
[239:00.00]And no one stopped them?
[239:01.40]How the f- Tucker, you know we're already spread thin.
[239:04.82]Are they headed north?
[239:06.68]Al!
[239:06.94]Are they headed towards us?
[239:09.79]Yes or no?
[239:13.57]I don't know.
[239:14.01]E3 isn't real.
[239:18.61]Maybe he knows.
[239:21.47]What the fuck are you up to now, huh?
[239:23.53]What's this about, huh?
[239:24.93]Damn it, Alki.
[239:26.49]It's not his job to know.
[239:28.16]It's your goddamn job to know.
[239:30.60]I can't be in two places at one time.
[239:32.76]You either want me here, running your dig, or you want me out there in the shit, chasing the Rippers.
[239:39.60]Go check the store, see how much ammo we got left.
[239:43.34]I'll tell Wheeler to watch the dig.
[239:45.93]What are you looking at?
[239:46.85]I don't know, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[239:48.65]Don't!
[239:48.79]I don't know, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[239:54.03]I can do that.
[239:54.41]I don't know, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[240:01.30]I thought that was a person's head for a second.
[240:02.68]I was like, why would you be handing a person's head to this person?
[240:08.36]Ride with me.
[240:11.20]Ooh, we're going to get a double mission here.
[240:13.08]All right, this is going to be good.
[240:14.44]We're in a golf cart, guys.
[240:15.70]Now you want me to quit?
[240:17.50]You want me to quit the game, or we're in a golf cart?
[240:20.16]The kind of people left out in the ship.
[240:21.70]Is there potential here?
[240:24.72]We lost two more to the people.
[240:27.84]It's not my problem.
[240:29.68]Finally, the game is good.
[240:30.62]Red... Rockstar added poker to Red Dead and you're playing this?
[240:34.32]I had to uninstall Red Dead Redemption 2 to install this game.
[240:58.33]It's not closer or further.
[241:01.99]Look, I'm not Boozer's old lady.
[241:03.71]He goes where he wants.
[241:07.97]Jesus.
[241:08.77]It's like 40 gigs.
[241:11.73]I had to uninstall right then.
[241:14.47]Just big game.
[241:18.42]Try using more gasoline.
[241:19.98]It burns faster, less fumes.
[241:22.28]Why is he waving?
[241:24.44]When it's all gone, what are you going to put in that bike of yours?
[241:27.06]Spit and sweat?
[241:28.95]Now what the hell is going on here?
[241:31.55]The count's off.
[241:32.39]Storage is missing food and some ammo.
[241:34.61]Jesus.
[241:35.63]Who was on watch last night?
[241:37.61]Give me control of the golf cart.
[241:39.15]Tonight, double the watch.
[241:40.43]This shit's starting to piss me off.
[241:43.11]You got it.
[241:44.77]Trouble in paradise.
[241:46.47]It's like I was saying.
[241:47.85]Camp's like a prison.
[241:48.83]Bunch of goddamn lazy liars.
[241:50.19]I don't think she's even... Her mouth's not even moving.
[241:51.53]Rapists and murderers.
[241:53.14]You know why that is?
[241:54.86]No idea.
[241:55.96]Because that's who we are.
[241:57.20]A freak show.
[241:58.74]Only folks survived were those mean enough, nasty enough to out-freak the freaks.
[242:04.56]The rest are here.
[242:06.04]Hope and I feed them, protect them, keep them nice and cozy and warm so they can sit on their asses and watch the world end.
[242:12.28]You, get your ass back to work.
[242:14.61]Don't make me go get Cyrus.
[242:16.25]We could have walked.
[242:17.87]We could have taken my motorcycle.
[242:19.91]It's cooler.
[242:20.77]Daytime is my time.
[242:23.47]Running this camp is not different than running a prison.
[242:27.05]I can't remember what you said.
[242:28.57]You were, you were what?
[242:29.73]You were a warden or something?
[242:32.87]Nothing so high and mighty.
[242:34.95]I was matron of the women's ward.
[242:37.41]You look like the sort who might have spent some time in the pen back in the day.
[242:41.95]Do we really have to do, like, follow Khadgar around in Shadrath City?
[242:49.12]Larson was on a run yesterday.
[242:50.96]Passed through Marion Fork.
[242:52.20]Every time we meet a new character.
[242:53.68]Young woman looked like, but he only caught a glance.
[242:56.67]He stopped to look around, but he never found her.
[242:59.57]Is he sure?
[243:00.55]Larson's been doing this long as you.
[243:02.75]He knows a person from a...
[243:05.99]You can skip this?
[243:07.61]How?
[243:07.77]He's getting beat up.
[243:08.71]Let me get in.
[243:38.02]Let me on that, come on.
[243:40.56]Come on, let me on my bike!
[243:41.72]Alright, I'm gonna go pee after we turn this in.
[243:57.75]We'll figure it out.
[243:58.59]Hm?
[244:06.38]One of my men escaped a ripper camp over by Iron Butte.
[244:12.61]Got tortured, like they always do.
[244:14.95]But this time, they kept asking me if he knew about it.
[244:18.01]Two bikers, two men, asking me if he'd ever seen them or heard of them.
[244:22.01]A lot of bikes around here.
[244:23.27]What's it got to do with me?
[244:27.15]He's never going to go pee.
[244:28.47]The ripper called a mongrel.
[244:29.39]How do you know I didn't already?
[244:31.15]How many drifters still flying colors around here?
[244:33.61]As if that shit matters.
[244:38.55]did have a coffee cup in here here's why you should never pee into a bottle or pee into a cup no matter what because you'll run into a scenario like I did um one time I was uh in a long road trip I was in the passenger side
[245:10.80]what I'm talking I'm talking about going pee into a bottle you can buy guns all right I see how it is
[245:36.02]Whoa, you guys must really be bored.
[245:37.20]You don't want to hear my, like... In the... When I was sitting in the passenger seat, I peed into a bottle story?
[245:43.71]Holy shit.
[245:47.75]Oh my goodness.
[245:53.84]You guys ever just test to see if it's possible?
[246:05.57]Oh.
[246:09.31]Choices.
[246:12.25]Bring the drugs to Tucker.
[246:13.27]Bring the drugs to Copeland.
[246:15.69]Manny promised to help restore your piece of shit bike.
[246:18.75]Weapons for sale.
[246:20.09]I want the bike.
[246:20.61]So I'm on a long road trip.
[246:22.59]Couple of buddies.
[246:45.52]There's no story.
[246:51.78]Now you see, the story is, if you want, this is the truth.
[246:56.48]Here's like a little tip for you guys.
[246:58.80]Anytime you tell a story that is not true, it's still true, but you're just making up a whole bunch of scenarios in the middle of it.
[247:07.01]So the real story is, in a Gatorade bottle, I don't know, maybe like seven years ago, I just had a full piss and pissed into the Gatorade bottle to see if it was possible.
[247:18.83]And I filled the whole Gatorade bottle up with pee and still had to go and had to like waddle to the bathroom to pee the rest into the toilet.
[247:30.68]So don't bring a bottle of Gatorade, a 32 ounce bottle of Gatorade by the way, big one.
[247:52.97]I think he's getting bored because now he's like he's telling made-up stories about peeing into bottles uh-oh I think we've crossed the line here hey let me tell you one time I like peed into a bottle I was passengers peeing
[248:22.78]I'm out of gas again.
[248:24.10]I'm gonna throw piss into the gas can.
[248:26.74]No.
[249:04.22]If you think I'm gonna actually answer the question that's being put into chat right now... You don't- you must not understand that this is a family-friendly streamer.
[249:24.61]The pee story.
[249:25.83]What time I peed?
[249:48.89]You see, what I was trying to do there is I was trying to make them jump off.
[249:53.79]I didn't think it was that far.
[249:57.09]That's not the stream.
[249:58.03]That's not the stream.
[249:58.91]The stream's still going.
[250:05.35]What does it cost me to stop playing this?
[250:06.85]No.
[250:10.04]All right, I'm gonna go pee.
[250:10.72]Let me pee and then contemplate my entire life.
[250:13.97]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[250:46.28]Hey, get your ass back to work.
[250:48.70]Hey, back to work.
[250:50.42]Hey, no, no, no, no, don't.
[250:58.11]I'm getting to work.
[250:59.29]All right, all right.
[251:01.09]Shit, shit, stop it.
[251:04.35]Hey, I'll be back.
[251:08.50]I'm gonna look around.
[251:09.96]All right.
[253:32.51]Can I just say something?
[253:36.23]Let me say something.
[253:37.19]I got, like, can we, I got something to say.
[253:42.85]The fact that there's, there are 3,200 people here right now, right?
[253:48.46]And even if you don't like the game, you think this is, you know, game's not great, you know, whatever, you're still here.
[253:57.94]Thank you.
[253:58.68]That's like,
[254:02.57]Let's keep playing.
[254:20.19]See, I'm like pulling your heartstrings here to make it so you are like, oh, yeah, yeah, that's good.
[254:26.15]Thanks, man.
[254:26.49]It's a good game.
[254:30.62]No, here's what's gonna happen.
[254:32.14]Alright.
[254:32.88]But I really do mean that, though.
[254:36.10]You know, people could, um, just leave.
[254:38.82]But... You're, like, having your fun, however you have it, right?
[254:45.40]We're going to... What's going on?
[254:52.41]Are you having fun?
[254:53.05]I actually am.
[254:54.11]I mean, it doesn't even matter what the game is.
[254:57.65]It's just fun just to dick around and have fun.
[255:00.19]Doesn't have to be the game any good.
[255:04.84]So we've been going for about four hours and four and a half hours or so.
[255:07.72]Just about another ten minutes or so.
[255:10.34]We are going to... Hear me out, okay?
[255:13.97]Are you hearing me out?
[255:17.11]Back to work.
[255:17.77]What is back to work?
[255:28.19]See if it was possible.
[255:29.25]See if what was possible.
[255:38.38]What is this?
[256:21.14]I'm laughing.
[256:25.07]Back to where we had to listen to that.
[256:28.63]I forgot to mute the mic.
[256:29.83]Who is fucking hurting me?
[256:38.81]Show us?
[256:40.83]Yeah, it's just the BRB screen.

[258:31.70]What's in here?
[258:34.85]Yeah, this is a Mario Yahtzee waiting room at this point.
[258:40.51]That's so fucking stupid.
[258:44.34]I'm never going to be able to repair this.
[258:51.49]Check out a site called TalkToTransformer.
[258:53.83]What is that?

[259:27.43]Like, stop.
[259:28.01]Like, do something else.
[259:29.17]We can play Mario.

[259:32.29]I gotta play this game.
[259:33.15]I'm having a great time.
[259:36.25]Back to work.

[261:09.29]Alright, let's go.
[261:10.15]I can get a weapon.
[261:14.89]Sell all the bear traps.
[261:16.19]I don't actually have any.
[261:26.76]Ammunition over here.
[261:27.52]Let me see if I can get a gun.
[261:34.15]Merchant.

[261:43.41]I can buy the repeater.
[261:45.45]I can buy a sidearm.
[261:47.87]I can... I already have this.
[261:51.25]22 repeater.
[261:52.31]Very low stopping power.
[261:53.27]Requires a lot of headshots.
[261:54.43]This is somewhat offset by ammo availability and quick fire rate.
[261:58.57]Repeater.
[261:58.93]1,000 bucks?
[262:02.21]Sure.
[262:03.67]That right there?
[262:04.69]Good piece.
[262:05.35]Thank you.

[262:11.96]Let's get some filled ammo up.
[262:14.60]Upgrade.
[262:15.16]Sidearm suppressor.
[262:16.66]Primary suppressor.
[262:18.40]Might as well.
[262:19.64]Good as new.
[262:21.07]And, okay, what about... I can't do grenades.
[262:24.37]Locker.
[262:26.47]Cool.
[262:27.95]Alright.
[262:28.81]Alright.
[262:29.81]Alright.
[262:31.17]Alright.
[262:31.63]Alright.
[262:31.87]Alright.
[262:32.05]Alright.
[262:33.84]Let's do one more mission and then I'm... I want to see the trail of zombies.
[262:37.62]And then we can move on.
[262:38.66]Okay.
[262:40.80]And then tomorrow... What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[262:43.58]What do you want to do tomorrow?
[262:46.18]Let's make our friend hangout plan for tomorrow.
[262:48.94]What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[262:55.33]Because, here, I'll tell you.
[262:56.25]I'll tell you.
[262:58.10]We've got Salmon Mac Season 2, Episode 3 is going to be on probably Saturday or Sunday.
[263:08.08]And then MS-DOS Part 2 is going to be the Saturday or Sunday.
[263:14.87]What is the best way for me to get out of here?
[263:23.35]I've got to get the heck out of here.
[263:28.47]Locate the Drifter.
[263:31.15]I guess, just get me out of here.
[263:33.69]This is really far away.
[263:37.57]Like, really far away.
[263:45.38]Rage 2?
[263:48.46]Um... I feel like two AAA back-to-back games like this in a row probably aren't very good to do.
[264:01.95]Can I get out of this tunnel?
[264:03.43]I don't know.
[264:06.96]We'll figure it out.
[264:09.44]This is AAA.
[264:10.24]This is as AAA as they come.
[264:11.72]This is a Sony first-party game.
[264:14.90]Exclusive.
[264:21.24]Why are these guys naked?
[264:23.90]Why are these guys naked?
[264:34.95]Were they swimming?
[264:35.63]Oh, I guess they just... they're just naked.
[264:44.03]Alright.
[264:44.29]Can I get out this way?
[264:47.54]Or do I have to... I can't just go up the mountain.
[264:55.22]I can't cross this.
[264:56.70]The bike's gonna get destroyed if I cross this.
[265:07.45]No, I'm not gonna ford the river.
[265:08.77]That'll be the last time you see this guy.
[265:11.31]We need to just get out.
[265:12.99]Alright, out.
[265:20.79]Finally.
[265:22.89]Are we out?
[265:24.53]We're making our way out.
[265:26.55]I think.
[265:29.63]No, we're not.
[265:31.56]I need to get back to this road.
[265:37.79]I guess we're just gonna go over here.
[265:56.90]Alright, good.
[266:00.47]Time for Mario.
[266:01.59]No, it's not Mario time.
[266:04.17]It's not Mario time!
[266:08.41]It will be very soon.
[266:09.31]I'm just going to do one more.
[266:12.91]Oh, why?
[266:13.79]Wasn't this just taking me over here?
[266:16.87]Wait.
[266:17.97]What is it taking me now?
[266:30.45]What's this Transformer thing?
[266:32.01]Talk to the Transformers?
[266:33.67]This is Radio Free Oregon.
[266:35.55]The truth shall set you free.
[266:40.61]Nope, not in the mood.
[266:45.92]You start the story prompt, it fills the rest of the story automatically.
[266:55.81]Wait, what?
[266:57.49]Shit, that's right, I gotta finish burning out these nests.
[267:00.01]Well, I don't have to finish anything.
[267:02.31]I don't have to do anything.
[267:04.05]You can just go.
[267:06.95]Alright, mission time.
[267:08.46]Then we're moving on.
[267:10.63]That sounds pretty cool.
[267:11.87]Alright, now we gotta go here.
[267:18.69]All the GPS's.
[267:19.87]Long ways away, huh?
[267:25.77]Well, I mean...
[267:38.94]fuel is at half already.
[267:40.10]It's because I was driving around in a circle trying to leave through the one opening that I could leave through.
[267:46.51]The one four-foot square I was allowed to go through to leave the camp.
[267:59.62]Uh, you seriously just did that to me.
[268:05.78]What a sniper.
[268:18.00]This person is seriously driving me fucking crazy.
[268:21.16]Should've gone back to work.
[268:28.14]Hey!
[268:52.65]he's gone by legendary game designer clive barker who made this game or bounties can use this
[269:17.76]Bob Barker.
[269:19.32]Dude.
[269:19.54]Seriously, this is the worst thing ever.
[269:26.31]I'm talking like even a tap, like a little touch.
[269:29.61]If you touch this fucking thing, you're mad Pokemon.
[269:35.61]Does the guy that made Zoo Tycoon made this?
[269:37.44]That's kind of a long way away from what Zoo Tycoon made.
[269:49.79]I got sniped again.
[269:50.73]I know you missed it because the internet sucks.
[269:55.99]But somebody jumped again and did the same thing.
[270:07.97]I don't know if anybody saw it, but it happened.
[270:23.91]Yes pick up the gas That fps drop and the lights come on
[270:44.11]Yeah, unfortunately we're stuck with the internet being bad very recently here.
[270:54.09]We usually hit this string of like a couple hours in a row.
[270:59.69]We drop like 20-30 thousand frames.
[271:04.10]So, more phone calls, more phone calls.
[271:07.40]Hello, hello, who is it?
[271:08.54]Yes, it's happening again.
[271:10.04]Problems are still here.
[271:29.02]oh that's not good
[271:44.01]I can land that, I know I can.
[271:48.39]God.
[271:49.17]Goddamn engine.
[271:50.93]I can land it.
[271:56.39]Why can't I?
[272:02.00]I thought I could minimize damage if I land flat!
[272:13.65]I guess not at terminal velocity.
[272:17.44]From that high, I think I still can.
[272:52.70]I just imagine, like, a fucking five-year-old that just doesn't understand how to drive and just keeps flying off the cliff.
[273:00.22]You should probably change to easy.
[273:01.49]And, you know, easy, I guess.
[273:03.65]What's that?
[273:04.27]I just want to drive the motorcycle.
[273:12.96]I can't believe this.
[273:13.88]You should change to easy mode.
[273:24.30]I can't make it.
[273:25.52]I have to accept it.
[273:30.21]Uh oh.
[273:34.01]My stomach hurts, hold on.
[273:35.35]Where's my health?
[273:36.71]Heal!
[273:41.85]I want to push you off the edge.
[273:43.41]Come on, off the edge!
[273:44.87]Oh, the one opportunity!
[273:46.03]There it is!
[273:46.83]Back!
[273:48.23]Do it!
[273:50.35]Go off the edge!
[273:51.37]Why is there an invisible wall here?
[273:54.04]Go off!
[273:56.14]Oh, come on.
[273:57.02]That's such bullshit.
[273:58.12]That would've been so cool.
[274:00.74]We could've... That would've been so cool.
[274:07.48]Can I get this?
[274:08.98]And back up, is the question.
[274:15.61]Yes, I can.
[274:17.43]Oh, yes, I can.
[274:23.37]Bullshit.
[274:27.64]I should be able to get down this.
[274:28.60]I need to go that way.
[274:33.22]Yeah.
[274:50.79]Now it's like a fucking YouTuber joke.
[274:53.31]I'm moving on.
[274:54.07]I tried to back up.
[275:02.34]I really thought I was going to back it up.
[275:05.64]Fucking wily coyote over here.
[275:07.52]Yeah.
[275:18.04]It was that simple.
[275:19.04]I didn't know there was going to be a place to go up here.
[275:21.96]It was that easy.
[275:23.74]It was so easy.
[275:30.15]I know the bike is slow, but I think it's because it's not upgraded.
[275:33.85]I'm pretty sure you can upgrade the bike and make it better and faster.
[275:47.27]Better, stronger, faster, faster.
[275:50.15]Slower.
[275:52.81]Faster.
[276:07.08]I'm sitting there looking at my internet.
[276:10.60]I'm looking over on the right side because it went down again and I took my eyes off the fucking screen.
[276:17.31]To look over here.
[276:18.41]I thought it was at zero.
[276:31.05]It wasn't zero.
[276:34.41]Alright, we're gonna have to have an angry phone call to Cox.
[276:38.18]Great.
[276:39.68]Every, like, three months I gotta call some internet company and be like, Hey, I'm a customer and I deserve to be treated right.
[276:49.09]Oh my goodness.
[277:11.07]Alright, we're almost there.
[277:19.33]We'll get there this time.
[277:23.08]Wait, what?
[277:28.74]There's no fast travel.
[277:29.96]Fast travel from map?
[277:30.78]Fast travel...
[277:42.29]Oops.
[277:53.43]Summon Soleri makes it way easier.
[278:02.85]Nobody told me I could fast travel.
[278:04.37]The game spent so long pausing the game to tell me I can repair my bike.
[278:08.83]But it never told me I could fast travel.
[278:16.33]Here we go.
[278:17.01]This is it.
[278:17.35]Then we can move on.
[278:18.45]Found some stuff.
[278:19.19]Found him.
[278:19.49]He's dead.
[278:49.41]Reloaded the bike.
[278:55.25]He hit this.
[278:58.21]Resident coma.
[279:00.91]That should be it.
[279:05.70]I hit it.
[279:08.54]I really did.
[279:12.86]Which way?
[279:16.28]Back on track.
[279:17.72]There he is!
[279:19.88]Biker bounty.
[279:20.98]Some bounty targets will stand and fight.
[279:22.52]Others will flee.
[279:23.14]Chase your target out and capture them alive to complete the job.
[279:25.18]Ramming into and shooting their bike are the best options.
[279:28.22]Keep your target alive.
[279:29.57]Silver helmet.
[279:30.81]Red gas tank.
[279:31.87]That's him.
[279:34.19]Where are you going?
[279:35.89]Get away!
[279:37.15]So you thought you'd ride into Copeland's camp.
[279:39.25]Shoot the place up.
[279:40.13]That about right.
[279:40.77]Kill a few folks.
[279:42.14]Take some shit.
[279:43.06]Just ride out.
[279:43.80]Take a shit?
[279:45.42]Chop it.
[279:46.68]How do I shoot from the bike?
[279:48.02]You would have taught me that.
[279:51.07]He was waiting for me.
[279:58.89]Bike combat.
[279:59.47]While on the bike, tap L1 to acquire a target and tap R1 to fire your sidearm.
[280:03.78]There it is.
[280:05.50]The size of your target displays how accurate you are.
[280:14.45]The smaller the vertical, the better your accuracy.
[280:19.58]Why would you say, ow, my bike?
[280:33.28]Ow, my bike!
[280:34.35]Did he shoot himself?
[280:42.51]Wait, who is talking now?
[280:45.53]Why did he fly off like that?
[280:47.95]I think he blew himself off.
[280:53.32]There we go.
[280:57.54]Bastards!
[280:58.18]How are they supposed to keep him alive?
[281:00.68]Is he alive?
[281:01.34]I don't think he's alive after that.
[281:03.19]What did you?
[281:10.81]He has a little bit of dirt on his face.
[281:15.86]He has like a smudge.
[281:31.86]Does it pick him up?
[281:32.96]They're spraying the Drifter.
[281:40.71]I'm... Okay, mission complete.
[281:44.55]Alright.
[281:45.71]Unlocked.
[281:46.09]Gear up for the ride.
[281:47.57]Copeland's Encampment Custom Accent.
[281:49.47]Hey, Drifter.
[282:01.11]Yeah, he's alive, but I won't promise you how long he's gonna stay that way.
[282:05.07]Deacon out.
[282:10.87]You tell him, Drifter.
[282:12.27]You tell him I said to go.
[282:14.75]Your ghost won't stop.
[282:19.75]There are rocks.
[282:20.51]That's what I'm doing.
[282:21.13]Oh, he knocked his helmet off.
[282:24.27]Talk to Deacon St.
[282:24.69]John.
[282:25.27]What?
[282:25.41]Are you listening?
[282:27.27]I talked to Alki the other day.
[282:29.09]Some of the other men.
[282:31.20]I know you've been doing runs for the camp.
[282:33.93]I just wanted to say thank you.
[282:36.83]I'm hitting him right in the face.
[282:50.85]St.
[282:51.05]John, this is Copeland.
[282:53.41]I haven't seen Boozer in a few days.
[282:54.95]He used to do runs for me, is all.
[282:58.77]I know you ride with him.
[283:00.62]Hi.
[283:00.84]Oh, no, no, no!
[283:31.18]OK, well.
[283:38.16]I tried.
[284:05.25]He's just made out of stone!
[284:09.01]Oh no!
[284:10.59]Stone men!
[284:22.97]I don't understand why I got up.
[284:37.23]There's no bullets in the gun!
[284:54.84]Stop smoking weed?
[284:57.84]What do you mean stop smoking weed?
[284:59.39]It's legal in Las Vegas.
[285:04.21]It's legal in Las Vegas.
[285:06.51]What are you talking about?
[285:07.17]I mean, like, what are you... Somebody thought I was going to do it.
[285:13.05]The thing that I do.
[285:14.09]All the time.
[285:20.68]I don't think so.
[285:25.92]Somebody knows what I was going to do.
[285:29.62]He smokes way too much weed.
[285:31.20]That's why he's, like, so, like, dumb, you know?
[285:33.08]He smokes too much weed.
[285:34.88]It makes him dumb.
[285:42.59]Fast travel, but hold on.
[285:48.25]Just needed to get some speed, that's all.
[285:50.96]I just needed some speed to hit the Stoneman.
[285:56.16]That's it, just need to let it, we need to go fast.
[286:01.06]Fast travel?
[286:01.78]Nah, we don't fast travel, we fuckin' slow travel in these parts.
[286:06.73]We just naturally don't.
[286:15.05]Hey, I'd rather be naturally dumb than unnaturally dumb.
[286:19.80]I don't need performance-enhancing drugs to be dumb.
[286:26.80]Hang in there, buddy.
[286:27.98]As soon as we get that arm patched up, we'll ride north, just like you said.
[286:31.19]I hope so.
[286:32.37]God, I miss you on the road.
[286:37.79]Just work on it.
[286:39.53]Perfect.
[286:40.37]That's what falls off the bike.
[286:41.63]And it's a red explosive.
[286:44.59]I still got some work to do on the bike.
[286:46.15]And we got to stock up on some gear.
[286:47.59]But once you're patched up, we're out of here.
[286:50.23]Freaking out.
[287:16.85]Oh, yeah, yeah go with a nice slow nice ammo nice and quiet shit I'll give you quiet Go ahead fellas
[287:44.29]I gave up the heck in the middle of that.
[287:47.45]I was gonna do really hard, and then I just got bored halfway through, and I was like, I can't.
[287:51.39]I'm doing it.
[287:51.75]I'm done.
[287:54.42]That was tongue-struck.
[287:55.40]It was the beginning.
[287:56.46]I was trying for it.
[287:58.86]Let's make some noise!
[288:06.10]Give me the first line.
[288:08.33]Can somebody give me the first line to Thunderstruck?
[288:13.07]I don't have any material.
[288:20.71]No, no, not Thunder.
[288:22.71]What does he say?
[288:23.67]The first line.
[288:30.37]Yeah, I know.
[288:31.01]It's like, .
[288:35.66]What does he actually say, though?
[288:42.05]Oh my god, I'm still alive!
[289:10.15]I gotta get on the bike, or I'm gonna die.
[289:12.50]Wait, rags.
[289:23.80]They won't let me die.
[289:26.82]Oh, finally we got a train!
[289:27.78]We got our first train!
[289:29.50]How many is it?
[289:29.88]One, two, three, four, five.
[289:33.70]Ready?
[289:46.28]Get out of the way, I'm trying to... Why am I still alive?
[289:52.88]Did it switch on easy mode?
[290:10.61]I'm done.
[290:22.80]Hey, just kidding.
[290:34.71]God damn it.
[290:43.05]Son of a...
[290:53.19]Deacon St.
[290:53.75]John, this is Tucker.
[290:55.49]Like I said before, I haven't seen Boozer's sweet face around these last few days.
[291:00.33]You sure he's all right?
[291:02.76]Keep it down.
[291:03.24]I'm sorry.
[291:03.82]Keep it down.
[291:04.76]What am I looking for here?
[291:06.38]Clear the infestation logging camp of infestations.
[291:10.08]You got it.
[291:10.84]One, two, three.
[291:11.82]That just didn't do anything.
[291:16.00]Like I said, I ain't his old lady, Deacon Albert.
[291:20.18]Can they get up here?
[291:25.66]Pretty good spot.
[291:35.08]Two.
[291:38.71]Where's Mario?
[291:39.57]Fuck.
[291:39.95]Hold on.
[291:40.25]Just wait.
[291:41.57]Just wait.
[291:41.91]Just have a little bit of patience.
[291:46.93]Have... You know, have five hours of patience.
[291:51.23]You know, just have a little bit of patience.
[292:08.75]Where you at?
[292:11.41]Where's the final two or three?
[292:20.40]Derma lied about Mario?
[292:24.23]Derma did not lie about Mario, because Mario's gonna come on the screen very, very shortly.
[292:29.11]In no time at all.
[292:30.57]You don't even believe how quickly it's gonna be on the screen.
[292:36.91]I'm going to title the stream Mario Yahtzee Rematch.
[292:49.28]Zero to... What?
[292:55.45]Clear all the nests.
[292:56.31]I don't think I even have any Molotovs to do that with.
[293:02.71]Do I?
[293:03.07]I think I threw them all being a dumbass.
[293:05.11]I got a use for you.
[293:12.08]I can only, like, how many can I craft?
[293:13.28]Just a few?
[293:13.90]Okay.
[293:19.59]Fire in the hole.
[293:21.55]Yeah.
[293:23.01]How'd you like that?
[293:23.97]Huh?
[293:24.37]Come on, you son of a bitch, just come on.
[293:25.55]Why are you like a bitch?
[293:29.18]I got ammo left.
[293:30.62]I got the load.
[293:36.72]Okay.
[293:41.43]Need more stuff.
[293:42.33]Hurry, hurry!
[293:45.50]Monster!
[293:46.38]Come on, I got double capped right there.
[293:59.48]Okay, one nurse done.
[294:05.90]How many more you got?
[294:09.45]Be brave, pile of shit.
[294:14.57]Be brave, assholes.
[294:16.27]Why are you saying that?
[294:24.70]There's another one probably over here.
[294:25.96]Okay.
[294:29.28]Oh, there's gotta be a nest.
[294:42.50]Did he say, oh no, I missed?
[294:44.65]Oh no, I missed.
[294:46.01]Shit.
[294:46.27]He's like way too pumped up for this right now.
[295:12.76]I need more bolts.
[295:14.42]Yeah.
[295:19.43]No!
[295:20.09]Fuck!
[295:20.67]No!
[295:20.83]I'm gonna die, because I'm gonna die.
[295:37.90]The night had maybe fewer freaks inside this nest.
