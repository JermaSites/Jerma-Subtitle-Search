[00:02.81]Where'd it go?
[00:05.79]Where'd it go?
[00:06.21]I just, like, lost my, uh... Oh, maybe... Did I?
[00:13.00]Oh, no, I am.
[00:13.60]I'm on, like, camera right now.
[00:14.90]Oh, jeez.
[00:16.10]What's going on, everybody?
[00:16.92]I'm, like, trying to set things up here.
[00:20.08]It's been a while since I put a facecam on a video, on a stream, so... Bear with me for a second.
[00:30.49]I'm going to find that.
[00:38.61]Go there.
[00:45.48]Cool.
[00:49.84]That's a long link.
[00:52.10]Holy crap.
[00:52.68]Okay.
[00:55.86]Good to go.
[00:59.69]At least I think I am.
[01:01.09]I gotta put this out onto Twitter, the Twitter space, so one second.
[01:15.02]Yo!
[01:17.98]This is a coffee, I know you might think I'm crazy, because I'm drinking a coffee at like 7... I almost pulled up my headphone, 7.30 at night.
[01:26.84]But I am crazy.
[01:29.24]So that's pretty much how we do it here.
[01:30.94]You guys know that.
[01:33.56]Let me... I got to figure out... Star told me how to do this.
[01:38.47]And I'm an idiot.
[01:39.13]And I just don't remember.
[01:40.55]So here's the link to the actual stream.
[01:43.43]I guess I haven't been doing that on Twitter.
[01:46.05]Oh, here comes the scary noises.
[01:49.88]I'm not looking forward to this, guys.
[01:51.78]Usually when I record these Scare Saturdays videos, I can kind of take my time and I can sit here and I can get ready.
[02:00.36]None of that in a live stream.
[02:01.62]I'm going to be playing live.
[02:03.05]So if you're watching this right now, if you don't know this is live, well, it is live.
[02:06.25]Oh, actually, let me rephrase that.
[02:07.35]If you're watching this on YouTube...
[02:09.31]Like, tomorrow, which would be Monday, which would be, yes.
[02:13.67]Then, this is not live, but it was live when I recorded it.
[02:17.88]But so is Facecam Fortress 2 and so is Scare Saturdays.
[02:20.20]Anyways, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore.
[02:21.48]Let's just keep going.
[02:25.64]Twitter.
[02:27.02]Tweet.
[02:33.57]No, why?
[02:33.99]I'm like default tweeting at somebody.
[02:35.89]What?
[02:35.99]What?
[02:39.74]Alright.
[02:40.44]Two seconds.
[02:42.96]Actually, you know what?
[02:43.84]Forget it.
[02:44.12]I'm doing it up here.
[02:46.71]I'm not going to do that on the phone this time because I can copy and paste this link.
[02:53.17]Twitter.
[02:58.55]Please sign into Twitter.
[03:03.43]I don't even know my password for Twitter.
[03:05.83]Oh my god.
[03:06.65]I don't even know it.
[03:08.07]I don't even know my Twitter password.
[03:12.09]Oh no.
[03:13.23]I haven't logged into Twitter.
[03:14.41]Because I just do it on my phone.
[03:16.05]I haven't logged into Twitter in like... In like months on the computer.
[03:21.10]Hold on.
[03:21.80]I think I have it written down right here.
[03:25.70]I do.
[03:26.20]Good.
[03:26.94]Good!
[03:28.36]Otherwise I would not have been able to log in ever again.
[03:36.35]Read that my writing is so bad.
[03:38.57]Okay Whoops Okay Now let me put the actual link to the stream now I
[04:07.92]Hey, streaming gray.
[04:12.16]Ah!
[04:14.67]That's such a long link.
[04:15.93]Oh my goodness.
[04:17.75]Alright, well, whatever.
[04:21.05]Whatevs.
[04:21.43]Let's see if it worked.
[04:27.27]Did it work?
[04:30.71]Oh, no.
[04:32.01]Am I, like, losing internet connection right now?
[04:33.75]No, I'm good.
[04:34.29]I'm good.
[04:37.67]Hey, did it work?
[04:38.66]Let's just check it to make sure this is the right link.
[04:41.50]Hey, it worked!
[04:43.76]Sweet.
[04:44.98]Alright, here we go.
[04:48.14]Now I can actually do this.
[04:49.50]I can actually link people to my stream.
[04:54.08]That makes me happy.
[04:57.29]One last little thing before we get started.
[04:58.97]I promised this would be the last thing, then we can go.
[05:03.21]I gotta put it on the Steam community.
[05:07.61]I'm getting nervous.
[05:08.51]I have to... Dude, if you saw the... If any of you guys that are in the chat right now saw the last Scare Saturdays from last week, this game really, really started to get messed up.
[05:18.69]Like, terrifying.
[05:19.95]Absolutely freaking terrifying.
[05:22.57]And I'm not looking forward to this next part.
[05:24.21]It's probably going to be like that for the rest of this goddamn game.
[05:27.89]So I'm a little antsy right now, as you can probably tell.
[05:32.11]Groups.
[05:33.01]Where am I?
[05:33.41]There I am.
[05:41.00]When did I say it was going to start?
[05:42.54]7.40?
[05:43.26]Eastern?
[05:44.52]I got three minutes.
[05:45.76]Alright.
[05:46.68]We're good.
[05:49.92]There it is.
[05:50.60]Alright.
[05:51.79]Almost 11,000 members in this Jerma's Inhumane Psychopaths.
[05:56.23]Wow.
[05:57.21]You guys are awesome.
[05:58.95]That's awesome.
[06:00.53]Let's make the announcement or event.
[06:04.55]New event.
[06:04.97]How do I do it?
[06:05.49]It's all new.
[06:06.01]There it is.
[06:23.84]Alright.
[06:25.68]Let's start playing gray now.
[06:28.73]Hmm.
[06:34.71]That's that.
[06:35.33]That is done.
[06:35.99]Here we go.
[06:38.23]Let me get the chat up here.
[06:50.50]Chat is there.
[06:52.26]Comments are being loaded.
[06:57.56]Okay.
[06:58.74]It's time to go.
[06:59.78]Can you guys hear me?
[07:00.39]How's the audio?
[07:01.37]I changed a couple things.
[07:02.33]Is the audio clear?
[07:04.39]Is it loud enough?
[07:06.45]I hope so.
[07:15.42]Hold on.
[07:15.74]What?
[07:17.44]Is that making footstep noise after I make the steps?
[07:24.52]I can't even open this door.
[07:25.34]Let's turn the audio up a little bit.
[07:28.04]Let's make this a little more scary.
[07:32.36]Oh, boy.
[07:36.95]Oh, boy.
[07:37.29]Oh, boy.
[07:37.55]Oh, boy.
[07:38.11]Okay.
[07:40.73]Where's my gun?
[07:45.07]Let's go.
[07:45.89]This door's locked.
[07:47.73]Oh.
[07:48.85]I can get in here.
[07:56.19]Looking at the chat.
[07:57.05]That's alright.
[07:57.57]Hey, at least I got all you guys here.
[07:58.99]Like, you guys here makes this a lot less terrible.
[08:02.29]Alright, it's just a fan.
[08:07.70]It's just a fan.
[08:09.40]Just a stupid fan.
[08:10.28]Okay.
[08:17.76]Not so bad.
[08:18.72]Why does everything have to be so dark?
[08:23.60]Don't do anything there.
[08:27.06]Can I turn this light on?
[08:28.82]Hey, I can turn the light on.
[08:29.90]Yeah, that does a lot.
[08:31.52]That didn't do anything.
[08:34.54]Oh my god.
[08:37.34]I don't have a gun.
[08:38.26]I don't have a gun.
[08:40.22]Seriously, my gun is like... These enemies are gonna drive me absolutely insane.
[08:53.57]I have no more bullets in this gun.
[08:54.89]I'm gonna die.
[08:55.79]I'm going to die.
[08:59.61]Wait, first aid.
[09:01.11]Oh, hell yeah.
[09:04.41]Oh, I just gotta keep touching it?
[09:05.45]Is that what I do?
[09:07.03]Apparently.
[09:09.35]Yes, hopefully this will be uploaded to YouTube.
[09:12.27]The last time I did a stream, it was not the case on YouTube, but hopefully this time it does, because this technically would be the next part of Gray.
[09:23.44]Do I really have to just sit here and just keep touching this?
[09:25.04]Okay, I'm good.
[09:30.34]Nothing in here.
[09:34.95]Those enemies.
[09:35.53]No.
[09:42.89]No, no, no, no.
[09:43.85]Can I touch that?
[09:46.22]Can I turn this on or something?
[09:47.80]No, that's not what it's for.
[09:50.52]What the hell?
[09:51.08]This guy's in like a kitty litter box.
[09:55.76]Man.
[09:58.68]Look at this guy.
[09:59.98]Look at this enemy.
[10:02.58]Holy crap.
[10:04.70]Give me a freaking break.
[10:09.73]I love how you guys in the chat are saying, behind you.
[10:12.87]Construction area.
[10:15.79]No.
[10:19.85]Something I'm supposed to do in here?
[10:22.41]I have no idea.
[10:26.45]No.
[10:26.79]Wait.
[10:27.11]Ladder.
[10:28.73]Go up the ladder.
[10:29.53]I'm guessing I gotta go through here.
[10:38.95]That would be the most logical thing.
[10:41.35]Is that a person?
[10:42.05]No.
[10:45.11]Can I get some more bullets for this gun?
[10:46.69]Instead of walking around with a pipe.
[10:48.84]That would be fantastic.
[10:52.76]Vent.
[10:52.90]Vent.
[10:56.72]Drop.
[10:58.18]Ah!
[10:59.02]Ah!
[10:59.44]What the hell is that?
[11:00.80]What the hell was that?
[11:03.10]That was like a black smoke cloud of death.
[11:10.72]Seriously.
[11:14.33]It's locked.
[11:14.97]It's locked.
[11:16.55]Everything is locked.
[11:21.07]Just stop breaking stuff.
[11:22.15]I don't even care.
[11:23.71]Smash all this stuff.
[11:30.18]No.
[11:32.56]No.
[11:34.44]Just a half an hour more?
[11:37.54]I'll be home soon.
[11:38.38]Just a half an hour more of just absolute nonsense and monsters and killing and hatred.
[11:43.39]That's fine.
[11:47.21]What?
[11:47.87]What?
[11:49.07]What?
[11:53.15]What?
[11:57.70]Oh my god!
[11:58.72]Oh my god!
[12:10.47]Stupid son of a... Gotta wash my hands now.
[12:15.33]They're all dirty.
[12:20.07]I don't like- I like don't know how to sit right- What?
[12:22.39]What?
[12:22.95]What?
[12:24.07]What?
[12:25.15]What did- That guy just-
[12:27.81]Why didn't he attack me?
[12:28.75]Why did he just come from behind me?
[12:33.07]Why?
[12:34.04]Why?
[12:35.38]I bet I have to go down there.
[12:36.50]I'm not going down there yet, though.
[12:37.68]Screw that.
[12:44.18]So, people were asking in the chat, or at least I saw a couple people said, What is this game?
[12:48.27]This is Gray.
[12:50.27]It's a mod for Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
[12:57.23]A guy just ran by me with a knife.
[12:58.89]Into here, into this room.
[13:01.95]He was like, he was like, what the hell is that?
[13:03.89]Hi.
[13:06.97]God.
[13:08.17]What is going on here?
[13:10.28]Run, run this way.
[13:11.32]I don't want to fight you.
[13:12.00]Please don't kill me.
[13:15.84]The door closed by itself.
[13:18.58]The door closed by itself, by the way.
[13:20.30]I didn't do that.
[13:20.90]Can I pick up his head?
[13:26.34]I apologize if the mic is like spiking when I scream, but I'm not changing the levels at this point.
[13:32.34]I'm too scared.
[13:35.00]Which way do I go?
[13:35.74]Left or right?
[13:36.28]Left or right?
[13:37.82]Left or right?
[13:38.74]Left.
[13:42.96]Still no bullets.
[13:43.80]Gotta break crates, somebody said.
[13:47.08]I saw that in the chat.
[13:48.14]Don't...
[13:54.88]How about break these boxes?
[13:56.26]Give me bullets.
[13:58.22]Come on.
[13:59.06]Break these stupid Donkey Kong barrels.
[14:11.03]Why won't it open?
[14:12.99]Dude.
[14:14.59]Oh, thank God.
[14:15.61]Batteries.
[14:16.81]Brighter flashlight.

[15:29.81]Wait.
[15:31.63]Hold on.
[15:32.87]Which one of these should I do then?
[15:36.57]This one?
[15:36.93]This is the auto-save.
[15:44.41]Oh, this is from the beginning.
[15:46.92]Oh, no freaking way.
[15:48.52]What about this one?
[15:51.72]Where's this window gonna take me?

[18:17.90]Let's go.
[18:19.79]Alright, I was here before.

[19:31.44]I already know.
[19:31.84]Yes, there he is.

[19:48.50]Save it again.
[19:50.83]Save it again.

[19:57.15]Close the door, I can't move, you... F-word.
[20:03.47]Thank you.
[20:06.87]Anybody?
[20:07.85]A guy pops out right here, I remember.
[20:10.61]I got a memory like an elephant.
[20:15.25]Yeah, see?
[20:16.07]This is the guy that killed me last time.
[20:18.75]What the hell?
[20:20.55]What the?
[20:20.87]That guy just murdered me!
[20:22.01]This guy just absolutely freaking murdered me!
[20:24.39]What am I supposed to do in that situation?
[20:27.72]Autosave!
[20:28.66]Load!
[20:29.46]Metro station!
[20:30.44]Go!
[20:33.56]That guy killed me in, like... How was I supposed to kill that guy?
[20:40.57]How was I supposed to kill that guy?
[20:41.87]Like, are you serious right now?
[20:46.71]Okay, seriously?
[20:52.37]How am I supposed to kill that guy?
[20:57.01]Do I have to, like, run away from that guy or something?
[20:58.95]That guy hits harder than anything I've ever played a game with.
[21:04.15]Save.
[21:04.75]No, don't save.
[21:06.28]There he is!
[21:07.58]I'm just jumping over him.
[21:08.34]Just run.
[21:08.76]I'm running from this guy.
[21:09.98]I don't... I can't!
[21:12.74]He's gonna kill me again!
[21:13.78]He's gonna kill me, literally, again.
[21:15.18]I don't know where to go!
[21:17.94]Is there bullets in here?
[21:19.58]Come on.
[21:20.51]Well, he's not looking.
[21:21.07]Give me the damn bullets!
[21:23.19]I have no words for what just happened right there.
[21:27.09]That was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[21:53.61]Oh, you know when Jerma, like, swears in a video that stuff's going down?
[22:00.92]Save it.
[22:03.62]Save game.
[22:10.20]I have no idea where to go.
[22:10.92]I, like, lost all, like, train of thought when that guy came at me.
[22:17.32]That, like, ultra boss that was, like, an actual just default enemy.
[22:23.74]What's this?
[22:24.16]Can I, like, fall through that?
[22:26.08]Apparently not.
[22:30.40]Through this door?
[22:31.36]Maybe?
[22:33.40]No.
[22:34.80]What?
[22:35.20]What?
[22:35.68]What?
[22:38.05]My goodness gracious.
[22:39.31]Okay, apparently it is... No, this is the ladder.
[22:41.91]It already goes down here.
[22:48.53]I've already been through here.
[22:50.15]I wish there was a map.
[22:50.95]I'm so confused right now.
[22:54.27]Out here?
[22:55.27]Maybe?
[22:57.49]I don't know.
[22:57.97]I have no idea.
[22:59.11]Yes.
[22:59.59]No.
[23:00.03]I just made it all the way out to where I was before.
[23:02.39]Congratulations.
[23:03.51]Time to go back in and go through the whole thing again.
[23:05.11]Yay.
[23:05.49]Here we go.
[23:05.91]Okay.
[23:07.19]Through here.
[23:09.35]Out through here.
[23:11.26]This way.
[23:12.86]Yeah.
[23:13.36]I remember that guy.
[23:14.36]Yeah.
[23:15.48]Boiler room.
[23:17.22]Nothing in here of interest except the big boiler.
[23:24.53]Through there.
[23:26.86]Through here.
[23:28.66]Yeah, I think it's... I think it's through here.
[23:32.96]No, it's not.
[23:33.38]This is where I... This is where I came from already.
[23:36.81]I'm so... Alright, left.
[23:40.47]No.
[23:42.05]Yes, this way.
[23:44.01]Yes, this way.
[23:46.30]Yes.
[23:47.76]This way.
[23:51.95]Yes, this way.
[23:52.91]No.
[23:54.13]This way.
[23:55.75]Let me go left.
[23:56.85]Can I even go anywhere?
[23:59.55]I think I'm just walking.
[24:00.19]Am I literally walking in circles right now?
[24:02.75]I am.
[24:02.99]Is there anything in here?
[24:06.61]I can't even do anything in here.
[24:07.68]Where am I supposed to go?
[24:11.34]I'm looking at the chat.
[24:12.12]Chat, help me.
[24:12.64]Where do I go?
[24:14.44]Backtrack?
[24:15.46]Am I going to go out back to where I was before?
[24:16.92]Okay.
[24:18.88]Okay.
[24:22.66]Just back out here then, right?
[24:25.20]And then, what, around the corner or something?
[24:28.14]Oh, okay.
[24:28.76]At the smoking door, I'm assuming.
[24:30.97]The door that is literally emitting smoke.
[24:34.15]God!
[24:34.55]This guy's gonna kill me.
[24:51.89]I'm gonna die.
[24:52.45]I have no health.
[24:55.15]Should I even, do I dare even save this game?
[24:57.87]I'm saving over like something else.
[24:59.75]How about like this one?
[25:01.56]This auto save that did me like no good.
[25:07.30]I need health.
[25:08.04]I'm gonna die.
[25:08.60]This game is hard, man.
[25:09.88]Holy crap.
[25:11.70]This is a hard freaking game.
[25:13.14]I'm gonna die right here.
[25:20.49]Oh, it's locked.
[25:23.21]What is that?
[25:24.65]Mod D... Oh, it's ModDB.
[25:26.71]It's a website.
[25:27.33]We download mods.
[25:29.07]Another guy's gonna come around the corner and I don't have any bullets.
[25:32.31]He's gonna kill me.
[25:33.19]I need to figure out... I need a new tactic here, guys.
[25:38.01]I'm dead.
[25:39.13]I'm dead by dawn.
[25:42.61]What?
[25:44.42]What the hell is going on?
[25:48.42]Oh!
[25:49.46]Kill her!
[25:50.30]Kill it!
[25:51.64]Kill it with fire!
[26:00.74]Can I, like, break out of the door?
[26:01.86]Oh, this is opening.
[26:03.64]Oh, I'm reading the chat.
[26:11.96]Oh, dear goodness.
[26:13.09]I...
[26:16.95]Save game.
[26:17.39]Save over the last one I just saved over.
[26:19.29]Where is it?
[26:20.31]Just one.
[26:20.73]I don't even know.
[26:21.35]Overwrite.
[26:25.67]What's with all these torture devices?
[26:28.59]I'm not comfortable until I have full health.
[26:34.87]Give me stuff.
[26:35.67]Give me something.
[26:40.03]Give me something to heal myself with, please.
[26:42.68]Please.
[26:45.08]Is that thing gonna open up on like a... Where am I supposed to go here?
[26:54.13]I can't open this door.
[26:57.41]Vent, maybe?
[26:57.97]There's a vent right here.
[26:58.87]I can't go through it though, can I?
[27:02.45]No.
[27:02.51]Do I have to go back in here?
[27:07.14]No.
[27:10.04]Looking for something to jump on, maybe.
[27:13.40]Or a vent.
[27:16.41]Or something.
[27:18.41]I can't even take out the drill.
[27:22.91]I don't know.
[27:24.21]Confused again.
[27:26.65]Up top there.
[27:31.23]Oh, that door opens.
[27:32.33]I just completely guessed that.
[27:39.84]Damn it.
[27:40.98]Damn it.
[27:44.24]Damn it, man.
[27:49.27]Cutscene.
[27:50.23]Autosave.
[27:51.53]Any semblance of logic or reason had fallen away.
[27:54.57]I had become lost within this place, seemingly cut loose from any landmarks of reality.
[27:59.29]The horrors I see appear to me as memories.
[28:02.43]Acts of unspeakable cruelty and evil long since committed, but as yet unpunished.
[28:08.57]Ooh, we're getting deep here now, guys.
[28:12.97]What's going on?
[28:13.95]Okay, there we go.
[28:14.67]Loading.
[28:17.33]X. Oh, you're going to put me in a room with two of these things with no health.
[28:24.30]I might as well just restart the whole game.
[28:27.76]Are these guys going to attack me?
[28:28.96]Maybe they only react to light.
[28:31.04]Let's just find out.
[28:32.14]Save game.
[28:32.44]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[28:37.95]Something's happening.
[28:38.53]No, I'm fine.
[28:39.65]Save game over this stupid one that I don't care about.
[28:43.99]Light.
[28:45.51]Alright, so they don't react to light now, apparently.
[28:47.45]Can I just kill them?
[28:49.32]No, they just disappear.
[28:53.00]Hmm.
[28:55.86]One second.
[28:57.10]Just one second here.
[28:58.54]I need to see something here.
[29:04.28]No.
[29:04.74]Whoops, whoops, whoops.
[29:06.74]I accidentally minimized the chat.
[29:12.36]There it is.
[29:13.98]Okay.
[29:18.21]Apparently people are saying be careful.
[29:20.87]I will take your advice.
[29:22.09]There's just a bunch of floating knives and scissors.
[29:25.55]I probably shouldn't touch those or I'm going to get hurt.
[29:29.21]No, they just disappear.
[29:31.98]Is there any help in the toilet seats?
[29:34.84]Seriously, come on.
[29:36.94]I need this.
[29:37.74]I need to be healed.
[29:40.64]Hello, lady of my dreams.
[29:45.88]What the hell?
[29:51.85]Oh, God.
[29:53.95]I do not want to fight whatever that is.
[29:55.39]I really don't want to fight whatever that is.
[30:01.26]Not looking forward to this, guys, at all.
[30:06.84]I need those things I can break for money.
[30:09.42]Money?
[30:10.44]What am I talking about?
[30:11.18]God, I don't want to go in here.
[30:20.03]It's too closed off.
[30:23.45]If I get rushed by somebody, it's over, guys.
[30:25.51]Hey, there she is again.
[30:30.49]Now we're talking.
[30:32.03]You see, now you're speaking my language.
[30:34.23]Give me a shotgun.
[30:36.50]That has infinite ammo.
[30:39.98]No, I don't want to go down there yet.
[30:44.48]Something's gonna... Something's gonna run out of here.
[30:49.25]I'm ready for you.
[30:50.13]I'm ready for you!
[30:50.59]Come on out!
[30:51.57]Come on, jump at me!
[30:52.21]Come on!
[30:52.51]I dare you!
[30:53.37]Jump at me!
[30:56.57]You can't go home.
[30:59.61]Why the hell not?
[31:00.19]Oh, great.
[31:01.03]I'm gonna do a chore for mom.
[31:08.16]I'm so dead.
[31:09.14]Play the game again.
[31:10.12]Over this one.
[31:12.30]Save.
[31:12.68]Overwrite.
[31:13.66]Here we go.
[31:15.78]They wouldn't give me a shotgun if I wasn't going to have to use it right freaking now.
[31:23.96]Okay.
[31:26.92]Hello?
[31:30.43]Everything is so dark.
[31:36.45]Where's my melee?
[31:37.77]No, I don't know what to take out.
[31:38.71]I don't know what to do.
[31:39.39]I don't know what to do, guys.
[31:43.05]Oh, no, no.
[31:50.66]Something's gonna sprint into this vent.
[31:53.28]I'm getting ready for it.
[31:59.78]Getting ready for it.
[32:01.22]What the hell is going on in this room?
[32:05.68]Is this blood just raining from the ceiling?
[32:08.98]Seven oh what oh Really let's just do the autosave it's probably right here So the question is Yeah, yep, I remember I remember don't worry lady So how do I how do I complete that do I need like a certain code or something?
[32:35.81]Oh?
[32:39.96]We're in a classroom.
[32:40.92]Okay.
[32:42.20]This is getting weird.
[32:47.85]Alright, students.
[32:48.65]Today we're gonna... The desks are gone.
[32:50.81]It's just a note.
[32:53.17]It was not an accident.
[32:58.83]Okay.
[33:13.30]How am I supposed to do that?
[33:14.24]Alright, I'm not going in that room.
[33:17.95]It just said it was not an accident and then people attacked me.
[33:21.31]That scared me a little bit because I wasn't expecting it because I forgot.
[33:25.29]No, I'm not going that way again.
[33:27.45]And I'm not going that way either.
[33:28.90]I'm going this way?
[33:31.76]Is somebody hanging right there?
[33:33.76]Yeah, they are.
[33:35.16]How pretty.
[33:36.76]Can I go this way?
[33:38.72]Okay.
[33:39.98]God, what the hell are you thinking, person?
[33:43.30]I can't even see right now, guys.
[33:52.69]I literally can't see anything.
[33:53.83]I feel like I'm playing Slender.
[33:54.99]I'm in, like, the woods.
[33:58.23]I seriously cannot even... I can only see, like, two feet in front of me.
[34:00.99]And I only have, like, 10% health.
[34:02.53]How am I supposed to beat this game?
[34:06.00]There's no sprint button.
[34:10.91]It's a dog!
[34:11.73]It's a rabid animal dog!
[34:15.15]That took way too many shots.
[34:16.49]If one of those guys touches me, I'm dead.
[34:19.56]Come on, man!
[34:20.98]I just killed one of you!
[34:22.38]There's no more bullets in that goddamn gun!
[34:27.58]Why don't they drop health?
[34:34.51]I'm dead.
[34:35.69]I'm gonna die right here.
[34:36.89]I'm dead right here.
[34:40.54]Another dog is going to jump out and it's going to kill me.
[34:42.36]Oh, it's okay.
[34:44.16]They take... It's over.
[34:46.96]It's over.
[34:47.52]Run.
[34:47.88]Can I just run?
[34:48.94]Just run from the goddamn thing.
[34:57.85]Let's look around at the scenery.
[34:59.37]Ooh, look at how beautiful things are.
[35:03.25]Oh, look.
[35:03.59]It's my little dog.
[35:06.12]Good thing it took three of you...
[35:09.30]This game is hard.
[35:10.10]I don't know how to heal.
[35:14.16]I'm not going anywhere until I find boxes.
[35:19.30]There's got to be somewhere I can get health.
[35:20.62]I mean, I only have this amount of health.
[35:23.72]I don't think I can do this unless I find some health first.
[35:27.24]I might have to go back to an older save.
[35:31.16]Because I don't think this is happening.
[35:38.46]I got to find health.
[35:40.43]That is the most important thing.
[35:41.69]But no, this is the classroom, isn't it?
[35:45.49]I need to be ready to put a handful of bullets.
[35:48.75]I need to complete one of these.
[35:51.35]Yeah, because see, here's like the room with like... Oh no, this is like the 76895 room.
[35:56.47]What the hell is that?
[36:00.58]Yeah, I need to... I guarantee you I need to know like a password.
[36:04.26]And I have to jump from number to number...
[36:07.06]Well, the first one is definitely seven.
[36:10.68]I gotta get to right there.
[36:12.60]You think I can do it?
[36:17.60]Wow.
[36:18.62]Oh.
[36:19.40]Oh, okay.
[36:20.60]Okay.
[36:21.04]I see.
[36:21.50]I see.
[36:21.94]I feel ya.
[36:25.14]I can go on two.
[36:26.24]I can't go on this one.
[36:28.52]Oh, yeah.
[36:28.97]I just figured it out.
[36:30.15]What do you know?
[36:31.13]Bang.
[36:33.11]Now give me health.
[36:34.27]I demand it.
[36:36.84]Save game.
[36:40.68]Okay, I gotta save right here.
[36:42.22]If there's a monster that comes out, I can kill it.
[36:45.02]I just have to be careful.
[36:45.83]Let's go ahead and open that door.
[36:49.33]Go ahead and break it open.
[36:50.35]I know you're gonna do it.
[36:52.67]What?
[36:52.83]It's like my living room.
[36:55.57]Please, health in the living room.
[36:57.21]Health somewhere in my house.
[36:58.71]This is somebody's house.
[36:59.87]I have no idea.
[37:00.31]Maybe it's not mine.
[37:02.89]Every door is locked.
[37:04.13]Let me guess.
[37:04.83]You're going to throw 500 monsters at me when I go through this door.
[37:14.48]I hear a regular dog.
[37:15.44]That scared the crap out of me.
[37:20.66]There's nothing I can really do.
[37:21.66]I'm going to have to just try and stay alive.
[37:24.49]It's going to be so difficult, though, because these things just do so much damage.
[37:31.95]Okay, there's a door.
[37:33.75]I gotta take things really... Get out of my face, buddy!
[37:39.33]Get plastered.
[37:41.39]Gotta stay alive, gotta stay alive, gotta stay alive.
[37:44.81]Gotta stay alive here.
[37:46.17]This is really important.
[37:47.53]I cannot die here.
[37:50.77]Alright, what the hell did I... What is that?
[37:52.97]What?
[37:54.56]Alright, I gotta make my way back out.
[37:57.02]Got to kill all the things... Yeah, come on!
[38:10.13]what yeah oh no it's my house all the enemies kill you instantly just like this ready hey buddy oh I should
[38:45.33]Oh, yeah.
[38:47.22]Go ahead.
[38:47.52]Come on out here and instantly kill me from like 15 feet away.
[38:50.06]Give me a headshot.
[38:52.68]A headshot doesn't kill him?
[38:57.27]God.
[39:01.25]I'm... There's nothing I can even do.
[39:03.23]I can't even play the game.
[39:06.09]Another one's gonna jump out right now and kill me.
[39:07.65]Watch this.
[39:07.97]Ready?
[39:08.25]Then five, four, three, two.
[39:11.25]Hey, yeah, watch this.
[39:12.17]I'm dead.
[39:13.93]Holy God.
[39:15.09]Okay, I'm still alive.
[39:22.58]Alright, this is my last try.
[39:24.12]This is my last try or else I'm gonna have to go back.
[39:32.34]This game doesn't mess around.
[39:33.24]This game is hard.
[39:40.39]Alright, I cannot take damage from this stupid baby thing.
[39:47.35]Did I get him?
[39:47.91]Good.
[39:48.77]Alright, I'm on a roll here.
[39:49.84]Come on.
[39:50.78]Oh yeah, touch the arm.
[39:52.38]I gotta shoot this guy right in his face.
[39:54.10]Don't get scared, he's right here.
[39:58.86]What the?
[40:01.48]How many bullets do I have?
[40:03.26]Good.
[40:04.34]Killed this baby, it jumps out right here.
[40:07.36]Gotta be ready for it, gotta be ready for it.
[40:09.90]It's in a split second.
[40:11.05]Come on.
[40:12.35]Come on.
[40:12.59]There you are.
[40:13.09]I see you.
[40:14.99]Yeah.
[40:15.65]Get out of my face.
[40:16.65]Do I have any bullets left?
[40:17.53]I have no idea.
[40:18.31]Is he dead?
[40:21.35]He's dead.
[40:22.60]Now get me out of here and give me health.
[40:25.06]Now.
[40:25.42]I command it.
[40:31.92]Really?
[40:34.12]Really?
[40:34.99]You're gonna put me back in this room without any health?
[40:41.54]Oh, that's pretty scary.
[40:42.50]But, yeah.
[40:43.42]Okay, so... I'm... How am I supposed to do this with this little health?
[40:54.59]I'm not a magician here, guys.
[40:56.25]Like, how am I supposed to do this?
[41:02.67]Save it.
[41:03.83]Yeah, I need ammo.
[41:06.54]Can I, like, break into the teacher's desk?
[41:08.20]Does she have anything in her desk?
[41:16.84]What is even hitting me?
[41:18.14]What?
[41:20.34]That guy wasn't here before.
[41:21.90]Yeah, it was not an accident.
[41:23.20]Cool.
[41:25.98]So I have to rebuild the body.
[41:27.31]That's what I'm doing.
[41:28.07]Well, I can't rebuild the body.
[41:30.13]Oh, good.
[41:30.39]We're in, like, a room full of these things that are just instantly gonna kill me.
[41:39.44]Good thing, like, the cranes.
[41:40.60]It sounds like a bunch of, like, goose...
[41:44.30]Oh, get out of here, you geese.
[41:45.62]Go, go, go, you stupid goose.
[41:47.14]Get out of here.
[41:56.11]Yeah, but I already used that health pack, didn't I?
[41:59.39]How often are you allowed to use it?
[42:02.15]Oh, what's going on with my frame right here?
[42:03.73]Oh, okay.
[42:06.43]Alright, backpack.
[42:08.20]How do I get to my backpack?
[42:12.28]I can't even, like, select it.
[42:16.09]Is there like an inventory button?
[42:20.39]I'm hitting 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[42:21.43]Where the hell is it?
[42:26.50]I can still use it.
[42:27.24]Alright.
[42:28.90]How do I use it?
[42:29.52]Hold on.
[42:36.94]Current objective.
[42:40.04]Weapon.
[42:40.36]Health kit.
[42:40.94]So use health kit is 8.
[42:46.72]It won't let me do it.
[42:51.89]I'm tapping 8 right now.
[42:55.53]Unless there's like a backpack button, but I don't think there is.
[42:58.25]See, when I hit 8, nothing happens.
[43:01.31]Yeah, I used the health pack already.
[43:02.79]I had to.
[43:03.17]I had like 5% health at some point halfway through here.
[43:07.76]I'm just in a lot of trouble.
[43:09.02]I might have to start from the beginning of this part.
[43:16.84]Can I just, like, run out of here?
[43:20.16]Is it, like, just, like, a run out of here?
[43:21.66]I'm just gonna walk around the edge, see if I can find a door.
[43:27.10]No.
[43:27.78]I have to kill all these things?
[43:30.26]This is not happening.
[43:31.50]This is just not happening.
[43:34.26]Maybe if I get, like, one... There's so many in here!
[43:40.96]Ring around the Rosie.
[43:41.90]If one of them touches me, I'm dead.
[43:46.81]Come on.
[43:47.47]Come on.
[43:47.69]Let's do a circle here.
[43:48.71]Come on, guys.
[43:51.97]I think this is gonna work.
[43:55.76]This actually might work.
[43:58.66]As stupid as this is... No.
[44:05.12]Alright, so this is what we're going to do.
[44:08.03]I'm going to go... I'm gonna go back here.
[44:14.19]How much health did I have back here?
[44:16.34]Did I have enough health back here where I can actually play the game?
[44:18.70]No, I didn't.
[44:21.36]Because this is this part right here.
[44:23.12]I need to find some health.
[44:24.66]That's just all there is to it.
[44:27.36]Because that's just not going to happen.
[44:28.78]I don't have my health kit.
[44:29.96]That's just not going to happen.
[44:31.44]Unless I can find some health.
[44:33.80]There is no health.
[44:36.88]I don't think there is any health.
[44:40.40]Is this just like not complete?
[44:41.76]That scared me.
[44:44.73]Break open every possible thing.
[44:48.98]No, can't break that.
[44:49.88]Can't break this.
[44:54.52]Yeah, I cannot get to that health pack.
[44:57.62]So, you guys, is it infinite?
[44:59.69]Should I be able to use this health pack?
[45:01.07]Or is it like a bug in the game right now?
[45:03.41]Could be.
[45:05.81]Could be.
[45:06.15]I don't know.
[45:07.39]Maybe this game is just like super screamingly hard.
[45:11.75]I picked normal.
[45:12.68]I'm pretty sure I picked like normal.
[45:16.00]Come on.
[45:17.20]Salvation is in these boxes.
[45:20.21]Is that a health kit?
[45:20.87]Did I just get a health kit right there?
[45:23.09]No, I got battery for the drill.
[45:26.41]Damn it.
[45:30.27]Use console and cheat some health?
[45:34.01]How do I do that?
[45:35.61]Can I actually do that?
[45:36.49]So I should be able to use this health kit, but I cannot.
[45:41.57]Is that correct?
[45:51.58]Yes, I am looking at the comments.
[45:55.47]So let's just say this is a bug and I can't use this health kit.
[46:00.77]Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[46:02.79]Should I just fill my health up right now?
[46:07.71]Oh no, it's a bug.
[46:14.79]Hold on a second.
[46:15.69]One second.
[46:16.27]I want to look this up and see if it's a bug or not.
[46:24.70]Because if that's not a bug, how are you supposed to beat this game?
[46:28.90]That's almost unbeatable.
[46:31.16]At least in my opinion.
[46:33.78]Let's go gray.
[46:40.43]Hmm.
[46:55.74]Trying to find like where I can get like more health I don't know Buddha mode Hack it for the sake of the live stream
[47:26.27]Yeah, I don't know.
[47:27.41]So I... How would I, like, give myself health?
[47:31.20]Health.
[47:32.24]Give.
[47:33.34]Me.
[47:33.82]Yes.
[47:34.50]Good.
[47:35.48]Unknown command line.
[47:39.12]If I should be able to use this... That's not cool.
[47:44.32]Yeah, I remember.
[47:45.72]Great, now I use the shotgun shell.
[47:47.40]Fantastic.
[47:49.40]Alright, so... What do I do?
[47:52.36]Type Buddha?
[47:54.62]Okay, there we go.
[47:57.37]Now what do I type?
[48:03.14]Height, width, x, y. History, peaks, group.
[48:09.56]So if I type Buddha into the console... I love how I might have to cheat to play through this game.
[48:22.02]Just Buddha.
[48:22.70]Buddha makes you invincible?
[48:25.72]Alright, guys.
[48:26.76]We might have to do it just for this part.
[48:29.30]Until I can find some health.
[48:30.24]Because I really cannot continue playing.
[48:32.04]Unless I can get some health.
[48:33.32]Because these guys hurt.
[48:35.05]I get killed in one hit from these guys.
[48:41.77]Alright.
[48:42.47]Let's do it.
[48:43.47]Let's just do it.
[48:44.43]I'm doing it.
[48:45.91]For the sake of the live stream.
[48:51.52]I'm going to do this just to get out of this area, so I can get some health.
[48:54.90]Because if that really is a bug, then that's unfortunate.
[48:59.04]Let's go!
[48:59.46]Oh, what's that?
[49:00.97]Buddha mode?
[49:02.19]Who wants a little bit of this?
[49:05.63]I'm not even... Hold on, wait.
[49:07.55]Somebody said hold 8.
[49:08.37]Yeah, holding 8 is not doing anything, as of right now.
[49:21.78]Oh, who wants to hack the game?
[49:23.50]Hacks, hack, hack, hack.
[49:25.40]Let's hack the game.
[49:29.41]Just until I can get out of this area.
[49:34.67]Because it's unbeatable unless I use the hacks.
[49:41.66]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[49:45.53]Yeah, I already know what's gonna happen.
[49:48.07]Let's just say... That didn't even work.
[49:51.65]Guys, that didn't even work.
[49:54.40]It didn't even work!
[49:56.92]Buddha Mode!
[49:57.56]This game is so hard that God Mode doesn't even work.
[50:04.36]Look at... Look at this!
[50:06.32]Look at this!
[50:08.14]Buddha.
[50:09.64]Buddha Mode is off.
[50:11.41]Buddha.
[50:12.03]Buddha mode is on.
[50:13.29]Okay, so Buddha mode is on right now.
[50:16.39]According to the game, I am unkillable.
[50:19.27]And would you look at this.
[50:20.71]I'm dying right now.
[50:30.20]Buddha mode is off.
[50:31.14]God.
[50:34.82]SP cheats.
[50:36.14]I can't believe I have to do this.
[50:39.22]SP cheats 1.
[50:41.56]And then... SP... Why?
[50:47.40]Why is this so ridiculous?
[50:50.04]Oh, a key.
[50:50.48]Okay, okay.
[50:51.92]So, I will not die.
[50:54.62]Wait, let me make sure I turn it back on.
[50:58.94]Buddha mode is on.
[51:00.80]I want to test this.
[51:01.66]So, I'm not supposed to be killable.
[51:08.91]Why am I wasting ammo?
[51:12.21]Okay, so it does work.
[51:13.11]That just scared the absolute crap out of me.
[51:16.35]Okay.
[51:17.73]This is great.
[51:19.45]Alright, mom or whatever.
[51:21.11]We're going to get you back together.
[51:23.56]Jerma just had to cheat.
[51:25.76]Let's just pretend that didn't happen.
[51:28.68]Can't go that way.
[51:32.57]Yeah, just until I can get out of this area, this is just, like, ridiculous.
[51:36.15]How am I supposed to beat this?
[51:38.60]Oh, teacher, teacher, somebody wrote a bad word on the chalkboard.
[51:41.80]Wait, there's supposed to be no desks.
[51:44.44]Okay, there we go.
[51:46.00]Yes, that was not an accident.
[51:47.20]Yeah, oh no, cool.
[51:48.42]Get out of here.
[51:55.77]Oh no, please don't hit me.
[51:58.39]No, you're in big, big trouble.
[52:02.29]I don't understand how you would do this without God Mode.
[52:06.54]How would you beat this part without God Mode?
[52:08.16]Like, I mean, if you play through the game like I was playing, just casually playing through, how are you supposed to beat that?
[52:13.75]That's just impossible.
[52:15.67]Unless you have, like, a thousand rounds in your gun and you have full health.
[52:19.91]Oh, wow, we really are putting it back together.
[52:24.53]Yeah, everyone's like, I can see the health pack.
[52:26.38]I can see it too.
[52:27.96]I can't go over to it though.
[52:29.64]And if I hit eight, it doesn't do anything.
[52:32.76]So I cannot heal myself.
[52:35.70]At least as of right now.
[52:37.72]And I have no more bullets in my guns.
[52:40.96]Well, this is turning out to be fantastic.
[52:42.97]Even with god mode on, I'm probably not going to be able to beat it.
[52:49.17]So where the hell am I supposed to go now?
[52:50.99]This way?
[52:52.97]Alright, let's finish this and give me some health so I can turn off... Wow.
[52:57.04]Yeah, I remember this part.
[52:58.14]This part with all the dogs.
[53:01.56]Health pack?
[53:02.14]Health pack.
[53:04.06]Give me some health.
[53:07.42]They don't mess around with the health in this game.
[53:09.14]This is ridiculous.
[53:10.96]Can I go in there?
[53:12.62]Probably not.
[53:14.11]Probably not.
[53:15.85]What program do I use to livestream?
[53:17.51]I use XSplit.
[53:19.49]XSplit.
[53:21.71]Now I can't see a damn thing.
[53:26.53]I really can't even see where I'm going.
[53:28.97]I'm trying to, like, peer in.
[53:30.07]This is so dark.
[53:31.71]There we are.
[53:32.09]Am I on, like, a road?
[53:33.88]No.
[53:34.18]I gotta get back over here.
[53:38.22]Remember, guys.
[53:39.14]If you wanna beat Gray, you gotta turn on God Mode.
[53:45.96]The amount of damage I would've just taken right there would've killed me if I had full health.
[53:51.51]Keep on going.
[53:52.35]Oh, look, another dog!
[53:53.87]Be my pet!
[53:54.61]Be my friend, doggie!
[54:05.44]Can I just type in... Someone said I can type in health 10?
[54:07.36]Didn't work.
[54:10.86]Something is blocking the door from the other side.
[54:13.74]Something is blocking the door from the other side.
[54:15.30]Let's get in somehow.
[54:17.24]Break in!
[54:18.66]Let's do a burglary.
[54:23.46]What the hell is that?
[54:30.16]Did I just pick up like a broomstick?
[54:34.86]What is this thing?
[54:37.48]Alright, it's like a mop.
[54:41.82]Get out of my... Dude, you can just club people with this thing.
[54:46.35]Holy crap.
[54:47.95]Wow.
[54:49.15]That thing's good.
[54:50.81]That thing's useful.
[54:54.01]I gotta get the chat back over here.
[55:00.30]Eight.
[55:00.94]No, I still can't use it.
[55:02.82]Just smash some desks.
[55:08.94]Any boxes?
[55:09.72]Anything?
[55:10.34]Okay, here we go.
[55:11.32]Here we go.
[55:14.00]Give me the health!
[55:14.76]Come on!
[55:17.10]Fill it up!
[55:19.54]Ladies and gentlemen, I can now turn off this stupid mode.
[55:25.46]We're gonna save game.
[55:27.92]Save game right here.
[55:29.58]And then we are going to turn off this mode.
[55:35.42]Buddha boat is off.
[55:39.10]There was only one of these every, like, 40 minutes.
[55:42.62]How fantastic.
[55:45.28]Alright, let's get ready here.
[55:46.16]Because now I don't have any way to save myself.
[55:50.27]Can I just hold this?
[55:51.19]Okay, I gotta...
[55:53.36]Alright, now I'm not protected anymore, so this is not good.
[56:00.32]Through here.
[56:02.88]Can I just knock these things over like a carnival?
[56:04.64]No.
[56:09.14]Definitely going to be something out here.
[56:10.50]I wish I could see anything.
[56:15.24]Is it still blocked?
[56:17.54]What?
[56:19.86]Okay.
[56:21.26]Okay.
[56:24.74]Wait.
[56:25.56]Oh, no.
[56:25.86]The door's blocked from the other side.
[56:27.46]Oh, there's a good thing.
[56:28.22]You just go right here.
[56:29.02]Hi.
[56:30.70]So, what?
[56:30.98]Did I miss something in here?
[56:31.80]I don't think I missed anything.
[56:35.02]Oh, yeah.
[56:35.36]There's a leg.
[56:37.16]Thanks.
[56:38.68]Alright.
[56:39.18]I've put you back together again, lady.
[56:41.50]I think you owe me something.
[56:42.56]What?
[56:52.37]Oh, Jerma, get the health outside.
[56:54.35]Oh!
[56:54.87]I missed more health?
[56:57.87]Great.
[57:00.48]I got health, though.
[57:01.16]I just got health.
[57:03.56]Whoa.
[57:04.54]Whoa.
[57:05.68]Whoa.
[57:06.10]Whoa.
[57:06.84]Oh, hello.
[57:09.00]Can I... What am I getting hurt by?
[57:10.77]Can I, like, hit her?
[57:15.37]What the...
[57:15.85]What?! !
[57:19.03]Oh my god.
[57:19.99]There's just like knives floating around everywhere.
[57:22.73]How am I supposed to... Why do I have such low health right now?
[57:31.47]Look at that.
[57:33.31]Bullets.
[57:34.85]No, not the damn drill.
[57:37.09]Pick up the gun.
[57:38.01]Oh my... Okay.
[57:45.98]This game is ridiculous.
[57:48.77]I had, like, full health.
[57:50.37]You try to tell me that in one second, like, I'm just gonna die.
[57:55.39]I apparently can't touch anything.
[57:58.83]Where is he?
[58:00.44]Wait, get over here.
[58:02.04]You little shit.
[58:05.10]I'm getting mad.
[58:08.68]I'm taking too much damage from everything.
[58:11.80]What?
[58:13.86]Give me the bullets.
[58:15.14]Where did they even land?
[58:18.06]Seriously, they're just dropping down through the floor!
[58:23.62]The bullets that I'm getting are dropping through the floor and not- Oh, hey bullets.
[58:29.53]Oh great.
[58:29.93]Yeah, this time they didn't fall through the damn floor.
[58:31.73]Oh great.
[58:38.79]Oh, maybe they'll- maybe they'll like fall through the world this time.
[58:42.17]Where is it?
[58:42.51]Where is it?
[58:42.83]Where is it?
[58:47.68]I just used every bullet.
[58:50.96]So what am I supposed to do?
[58:52.04]Like, jump from here to here?
[58:53.74]And like, hit this guy?
[58:54.46]Can I shoot him?
[58:56.88]Sure I can.
[58:58.18]Oh no, don't worry, he's like gonna just instantly kill me.
[59:04.08]Oh, cool.
[59:05.92]Oh, great.
[59:06.78]Time to restart it again.
[59:19.07]From this thing.
[59:19.63]From this stupid thing.
[59:23.17]Alright, let me... You might see a rage quit.
[59:34.96]We might get a rage quit.
[59:38.41]Alright, give me the crates.
[59:39.29]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[59:40.11]Okay, hopefully they don't fall through the center of the Earth.
[59:43.51]Just do it quick.
[59:44.29]Do it quick.
[59:44.77]Get them all.
[59:46.19]Do them all.
[59:46.91]Come on.
[59:47.31]Hit this guy in the face.
[59:49.95]Good, good, good, good, good.
[59:51.99]Uh, you know what?
[59:52.37]Just stop shooting this guy.
[59:53.75]No.
[59:54.17]This guy's gonna stop spawning.
[59:58.45]Get unloaded on!
[60:01.47]No, get... Come on, do it again.
[60:04.21]Alright, cool.
[60:05.66]He's dead.
[60:07.37]Load, load, load, load, load.
[60:09.57]Dead.
[60:10.35]Good.
[60:10.55]I love how they're just instantly dying.
[60:12.96]This is helping me a lot.
[60:17.50]Will you just get away from me?
[60:20.66]Alright, I need more bullets now.
[60:25.70]Man, everything just spawns so frequently.
[60:30.57]I don't want to get hit.
[60:35.07]These things just spawn so much, it's ridiculous.
[60:38.00]I need more ammo, and I can only get the ammo from the boxes.
[60:44.50]Oh my god, this is so stupid.
[60:47.92]Come on.
[60:50.22]There's apparently nothing in that one.
[60:51.68]I don't want to get hit by that.
[60:59.23]Where did the bullets just go?
[61:01.29]Why did they drop?
[61:03.55]I have 18 shots.
[61:04.77]I'm going to kill these three guys with 18 shots.
[61:06.71]No way.
[61:09.41]Good.
[61:09.91]Kill the other one.
[61:10.57]From long range.
[61:11.15]Come on.
[61:12.22]Get him.
[61:13.24]Come on.
[61:13.50]Come on.
[61:13.72]Come on.
[61:13.94]Come on.
[61:14.22]Come on.
[61:14.42]Come on.
[61:14.58]Come on.
[61:16.70]Come on.
[61:18.18]Get away from me.
[61:20.18]It's over.
[61:20.52]I don't have any bullets.
[61:21.57]I don't have enough shots.
[61:24.49]I did it.
[61:25.03]I did it.
[61:25.59]I just did it.
[61:35.00]Okay.
[61:37.12]Fine.
[61:38.22]You want to play this game?
[61:39.42]You want to play this game?
[61:41.06]We'll play this game.
[61:41.92]Come on.
[61:43.06]Somebody hurt me.
[61:44.22]Somebody just come and kill me.
[61:47.51]You aren't beating me this time.
[61:48.67]I'll just take every single crate.
[61:52.29]Even the ones that drop down into the Earth.
[61:57.35]And I'm killing every single one of yous.
[62:03.44]I love how just from me doing this, I still haven't like died the whole way.
[62:11.41]Yeah.
[62:12.05]No, don't waste those.
[62:13.05]Get out of my face.
[62:13.95]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[62:18.80]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[62:33.00]Where's the fourth person?
[62:35.74]Look at how many of these little things are all over the place.
[62:38.05]Um... Alright.
[62:39.55]Where's this fourth person I was supposed to be shooting at?
[62:47.45]I don't see anybody.
[62:49.77]Maybe she's up here.
[62:51.19]Give me the balls.
[62:54.87]Give me that.
[62:56.79]Um...
[63:03.89]Oh, now they spawn these guys.
[63:05.22]Oh man, this game is not possible.
[63:21.64]Oh, this is disgusting.
[63:29.47]Okay.
[63:36.45]Uh, health... Everyone's like, I can't believe you're cheating.
[63:42.23]Well, for the sake of the stream, I want to get past some of these parts that are, uh... That are very, very, very, very... If not impossible, then so difficult that I can't beat them.
[63:56.74]For the sake of the stream.
[63:58.84]I turned it off, don't worry.
[64:01.38]Uh, how do I get myself just health?
[64:03.72]Or should I just not even do that?
[64:08.30]Okay.
[64:09.94]Let's clean some dishes.
[64:14.40]So, why was I just drilling this person again?
[64:17.52]For some reason?
[64:18.20]I don't know.
[64:19.60]Turning it back on.
[64:20.32]Alright, the door's locked.
[64:26.74]The door's jammed.
[64:32.10]I... I think I did what I could.
[64:35.96]So what, I put her back together again?
[64:38.82]Humpty Dumpty?
[64:44.00]Where am I now?
[64:47.18]Starting a new life fresh from the beginning.
[64:55.08]Is it like my wife or like my daughter or something?
[64:57.30]What the hell is that?
[65:02.19]I left you with so many questions.
[65:04.75]But now I can help you.
[65:06.31]You'll find the truth in the basement.
[65:08.52]Find the truth in the basement.
[65:10.88]That sounds fantastic.
[65:16.02]Can I do that?
[65:17.52]That didn't work.
[65:20.23]Hurt me to a hundred.
[65:24.43]Oh, booted.
[65:25.57]I'm going to get booted from the game.
[65:29.49]Let's go to... I gotta keep it on.
[65:32.41]At least just for now.
[65:36.23]I actually did read in a lot of places that this game was way too difficult.
[65:42.00]That's what I read on a lot of mod forums and stuff.
[65:43.88]Before I even played the game, so... Now I know.
[65:46.94]This game is incredibly difficult.
[65:51.68]Body bags, huh?
[65:56.09]So what am I, like a serial killer in my off time or something?
[66:03.52]Alright, let's see if this person wrote it.
[66:08.69]Alright, give health 100 didn't work.
[66:15.81]Bathroom?
[66:17.75]No.
[66:21.09]Kitchen knife.
[66:23.82]Cool.
[66:26.28]Oh, do I actually, like, type it into here?
[66:30.32]Oh, let's see.
[66:37.84]No.
[66:44.06]That didn't work.
[66:47.66]Who's going to get stabbed in their face?
[66:50.04]Somebody is.
[66:51.66]Hopefully it's somebody down here.
[66:56.97]Somebody said do health kit.
[67:01.17]Nope.
[67:06.25]What was I supposed to do down here?
[67:11.65]Alright, F6.
[67:12.73]Save.
[67:18.36]What was that?
[67:21.04]I don't know.
[67:23.52]Break these.
[67:24.02]Nope.
[67:26.86]Alright, lady, you told me to go down to the basement, and I'm down in the basement.
[67:30.41]And I don't see dog crap down here.
[67:35.01]As I say that, I find the secret passage.
[67:39.61]Yay!
[67:40.11]Yay!
[67:41.68]Alright.
[67:45.88]So.
[67:47.80]I think.
[67:49.36]I'm going to.
[67:51.92]I think I'm going to transition to some TF2.
[67:55.48]At least right now.
[67:57.64]For the remainder of the stream.
[67:58.92]What is this place?
[68:00.12]Maybe not.
[68:00.82]Let's see.
[68:03.18]Currently in the.
[68:04.56]Oh, God.
[68:05.44]My head hurts.
[68:08.06]What the hell is that?
[68:18.21]Attempted to create unknown entity.
[68:19.75]Alright, let's just go.
[68:27.17]Well, that guy disappeared.
[68:28.09]And now I'm like, stop doing that!
[68:38.94]Oh, good thing I got bandages.
[68:41.52]That's gonna help a lot.
[68:49.23]Break stuff.
[68:51.53]Alright, once I get through this little area, I'm going to transition to some Team Fortress 2.
[69:03.58]No.
[69:04.42]I'm assuming this wooden wall can be broken out.
[69:06.50]No.
[69:11.71]No.
[69:15.51]No.
[69:22.93]Is there a light switch?
[69:23.71]Give me a light switch.
[69:24.53]Come on, now.
[69:25.03]Anything in here?
[69:31.37]Bunch of empty rooms.
[69:32.47]Whoever owns this place doesn't have a whole lot of stuff.
[69:35.21]Stop screaming at me!
[69:39.53]Oh, can I pick up that help?
[69:46.04]Uh, if I go around, probably.
[69:47.34]Gotta go around.
[69:53.91]No.
[69:55.40]No.
[69:57.98]Oh, look.
[69:58.28]A brick wall that's just in the shape of a door.
[70:01.58]That makes complete sense.
[70:02.56]Do I keep going down?
[70:07.18]Maybe.
[70:16.95]Alright.
[70:17.69]Made it.
[70:19.31]I made it.
[70:20.11]I made it.
[70:22.99]Another... Alright, we need some stuff.
[70:26.42]Good, I got bullets.
[70:28.28]Happy days.
[70:34.52]Sunday, Monday, happy days.
[70:36.96]Thursday, Friday, happy days.
[70:39.78]Sunday, Sunday, Sunday days.
[70:42.02]The weekend comes.
[70:43.32]Have some fun.
[70:44.50]Having some fun with you.
[70:46.30]These days are ours.
[70:48.68]Gotta stream and read those happy days.
[70:51.07]These days are ours.
[70:54.47]Okay.
[70:55.79]I can do this now.
[70:58.75]No longer protected.
[70:59.83]F6.
[71:02.05]Let's go.
[71:05.88]And a machine gun.
[71:08.28]Good thing I can have no ammo for this damn thing.
[71:29.16]That scared the absolute diarrhea out of me.
[71:38.49]Oh man, oh freaking man.
[71:42.79]I probably just scared everybody watching the stream because of that.
[71:48.73]Oh, my word.
[71:58.06]That is where I'm going to end Gray for tonight.
[72:01.84]I got it saved.
[72:05.06]My like teeth hurt from that last scare.
[72:12.19]I did not expect those enemies to be right around the corner.
[72:15.97]But hey, you know what?
[72:16.93]Whatever.
[72:17.20]That's a good note to go out on.
[72:19.58]So, screen's going to go black for a second.
[72:21.18]I'm going to load up some Team Fortress.
[72:24.12]And let's see.
[72:25.04]Don't worry.
[72:25.40]You'll still get to see my face.
[72:26.38]Don't worry.
[72:28.39]Quit.
[72:29.51]Are you sure you want to quit?
[72:30.41]I am absolutely sure about that.
[72:34.51]I am so positive about that.
[72:38.10]God, look at my... My face is, like, all red.
[72:40.32]I'm so, like, scared.
[72:41.26]My, like, nerves.
[72:42.00]My, like, sweating.
[72:44.18]My goodness.
[72:46.00]Let's go, like, big germicam.
[72:47.92]Hey!
[72:48.36]What's up, everybody?
[72:51.48]Alright.
[72:52.02]While we have that sitting there... Let's load up some Team Fortress 2.
[72:56.77]Why not, right?
[72:58.51]Play it for, like, 20 minutes or so.
[72:59.59]25.
[72:59.67]Whew!
[73:02.85]Gray, you are an impossible game, and you're incredibly terrifying.
[73:07.78]Great.
[73:09.50]Let's go.
[73:09.98]TF2.
[73:12.70]Steam.
[73:13.40]It's going to take a second or here, guys.
[73:15.24]It's going to take a second or here.
[73:17.28]You're probably going to hear the sounds, but you will not see the visuals.
[73:27.45]Alright, I need something to lighten me up a little bit.
[73:29.19]That was just scary and terrifying and impossible and hard and...
[73:36.43]Let's play some TF2.
[73:37.21]We can just have some good old-fashioned fun with TF2.
[73:41.23]Make sure my shirt's on straight, my tie's on right.
[73:54.87]What do I have?
[73:55.39]A new item?
[73:57.90]What?

[77:57.85]I just got it when I logged in.
[77:58.95]I didn't buy anything.
[78:00.01]I didn't pre-order anything.
[78:01.15]At least recently.
[78:02.71]What is this for?
[78:03.29]I'm trying to like... I'm trying to like change my settings and I just crashed out of TF2.
[78:13.28]Alright.
[78:14.82]That's one way for that to work.
[78:17.87]Okay, let's try this again.
[78:19.01]I was like, oh, change the style.
[78:22.85]Okay.
[78:27.03]Let me look at the chat.
[78:27.73]Let's chat.
[78:29.57]You bought Total War Shogun.
[78:32.47]Alright, so wait.
[78:34.51]They did another promotion for Shogun Total War?
[78:40.48]That's pretty weird seeing as how the game came out.
[78:43.24]A long time ago.
[78:43.88]Wait, are they trying to promote it or something?
[78:48.86]Let's get back into my server.
[78:53.64]Server's full.
[78:57.56]I have a reserved slot.
[78:59.10]All the reserved slots are full right now?
[79:01.48]Are you kidding me?
[79:04.88]Are you absolutely kidding me right now?
[79:09.88]Yeah, all the reserved slots are full.
[79:12.04]Oh, crap.
[79:15.46]Let's see.
[79:16.02]I can probably get in.
[79:22.14]No.
[79:25.38]No!
[79:28.26]Well, it looks like we're playing somewhere else.
[79:31.06]Because I can't even get into my own server.
[79:33.14]Oh, no.
[79:37.03]Bring this back up so you guys can see what I'm talking about.
[79:40.35]Hello.
[79:42.23]Mm-hmm.
[79:45.17]Let's try this again.
[79:50.34]No.
[79:50.68]Alright.
[79:52.86]So, we're... Oh, whoops.
[79:54.28]I just turned off my... Whoops.
[79:56.16]Hold on.
[79:59.32]Oh, there we go.
[79:59.90]Whoops.
[80:01.60]I use Direct Show to stream, so that's why it's probably just like... Wait, what the hell was that?
[80:06.78]Alright, how about... Free Frag.
[80:12.46]Now let's go to... Go to Doomsday.
[80:16.90]No, I don't want to go there.
[80:20.39]Good old Badwater on Untamed Gaming.
[80:24.93]Here is the IP.
[80:25.87]It's going to be on the screen right now.
[80:27.77]If you want to see it.
[80:31.67]and I'm going in I would put it in the chat but the chat goes so fast that it's it's very difficult to uh to put it at least on youtube hopefully they would change that I don't think they're going to though I'm almost out of coffee uh-oh is this crashing again are you absolutely kidding no no we're good we're good
[81:03.65]What the hell is this?
[81:07.13]Alright.

[81:12.77]I am dropping everything.
[81:13.85]Get back up there.
[81:16.75]Stay there.
[81:21.01]Hold on.
[81:22.39]Move over here.
[81:23.41]So I can see the chat.
[81:26.32]Thank you.
[81:28.78]Whoa, lag.
[81:30.08]A ton of it.
[81:33.62]My sensitivity, I forgot.
[81:34.70]I changed it.
[81:38.31]Mouse.
[81:39.11]It's three.
[81:39.71]It has to be up higher.
[81:40.53]There we go.
[81:42.45]Yeah, whenever I play Sniper, I put my sensitivity down.
[81:45.37]Because I always just overshoot everybody all the time.
[81:53.90]No!
[81:55.20]No!
[82:00.14]No team stacking.
[82:02.02]You got it.
[82:02.94]Don't worry.
[82:04.32]Scout's not gonna happen.
[82:05.16]Playing Soldier.
[82:07.44]Soldier.
[82:11.48]I'll play as Soldier and then I'll play as Spy.
[82:14.09]That sounds like a plan.
[82:18.51]What do I got?
[82:19.49]The whip?
[82:20.27]Let's go, man.
[82:20.93]Let's run super fast.
[82:25.65]Oh...
[82:32.25]You are not getting away from me.
[82:42.11]We're dead.
[82:45.53]Got the assist on that one.
[82:46.59]Don't know how.
[82:49.13]Boink!
[82:51.02]Need health so bad.
[82:56.02]I'll take it.
[82:59.50]I'll take it.
[83:00.14]Where's health?
[83:00.84]Any engineers over here?
[83:04.28]Oh, my server's empty now?
[83:05.23]Alright.
[83:06.49]After I die, I will move on over there.
[83:09.03]I just want to get at least one.
[83:10.27]Actually, no.
[83:10.81]I'm not going to abandon this team.
[83:12.53]Not yet.
[83:14.97]Heal me.
[83:16.71]Help me, Medic.
[83:20.77]And let's go.
[83:25.42]Nobody?
[83:25.70]You didn't hit anybody with that?
[83:26.58]Get him.
[83:33.90]Somebody behind us?
[83:35.98]Probably.
[83:36.52]Wow.
[83:37.04]I just saw a sniper fire.
[83:46.93]Oh.
[83:49.55]Oh, hi.
[83:50.07]Did I rocket jump?
[83:50.87]I know how.
[83:51.37]I could.
[83:51.65]Let's get up here.
[84:00.12]Nope.
[84:00.62]Nope.
[84:01.00]Sniper.
[84:01.34]I'm scared of you.
[84:07.79]Kill the cipher!
[84:10.89]Get a double!
[84:11.85]Run!
[84:12.75]Oh, you know what I can actually do?
[84:21.36]After this round, I can just blow out the server so it just kind of refreshes itself.
[84:27.84]Probably do that.
[84:29.08]Just to get in.
[84:29.84]But my TF did crash, so that was stupid.
[84:31.44]That was weird.
[84:33.70]Behind you in your closet.
[84:35.22]Oh!
[84:37.06]thank god I thought you were really there medic I'll take that it's a good clip sniper oh you think you're gonna shoot wow there's two snipers one over here one over there
[85:07.70]Oh, you got a backstab.
[85:08.50]Good job!
[85:13.42]For a second, I thought that Pyro just reflected something into my face, but no, it was a sniper.
[85:17.72]They got like three or four snipers on their team.
[85:19.32]Holy crap.
[85:26.24]We're doing alright.
[85:29.08]We're doing alright here.
[85:34.89]Respawn time.
[85:37.61]Jerma, what do you think of streaming on Twitch?
[85:40.81]I think a lot of things about it.
[85:43.63]Some of which I... I... I'm going to plead the fifth on this one.
[85:53.03]But I... Twitch is awesome.
[85:55.77]We'll just say that.
[85:59.53]We will just say that.
[86:03.41]But, yeah.
[86:04.55]Streaming on YouTube is... is good.
[86:08.83]But as a lot of you know, it has many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many problems.
[86:17.77]Now, I mean, I could go off for a long time, but for the sake of... We're playing TF2 here.
[86:24.68]And I love Team Fortress 2.
[86:26.90]We'll end with that.
[86:27.70]Kaboom!
[86:35.15]You know, I want to play as... I'm going to go Engineer.
[86:38.63]We need it.
[86:39.73]We need Engineer.
[86:47.44]Trying to find a cool name to read.
[86:50.52]Stipulation with just a holy mackerel?
[86:54.42]You know what?
[86:55.70]Oh, I will play... I know it.
[86:57.04]Whatever.
[86:57.32]Three spies.
[86:57.86]Let's do it.
[87:00.43]Three spies.
[87:01.51]Oh, no!
[87:01.95]It's going to crash.
[87:04.48]What the hell is going on?
[87:06.88]What in the name of... Am I still streaming right now?
[87:11.77]Am I still alive?
[87:15.43]What just happened?
[87:16.91]Are we still here?
[87:17.51]Did my stream just turn off?
[87:29.19]Okay.
[87:30.33]Did my stream just turn off?
[87:33.34]That was really, really weird.
[87:35.88]My whole computer just died right there.
[87:44.07]Oh, watch out, thing.
[87:46.47]Watch out, thing.
[87:47.99]It was just like, gajoon, gajoon, gajoon, gajoon, gajoon.
[87:50.17]Oh, watch out, thing.
[87:52.32]Did my stream turn off and turn on?
[87:53.64]Oh, no.
[87:53.80]Watch out, thing.
[87:56.71]Oh, please guys tell me that the stream didn't turn off.
[88:00.43]Did like the actual stream turn off or was I still here?
[88:02.90]Because if I still, if I wasn't here, it's not going to get uploaded to YouTube.
[88:09.66]Please tell me that it didn't do that.
[88:12.10]Because there's a whole lot of gray that people are not going to be able to see.
[88:23.53]Okay.
[88:24.39]Hey, everybody.
[88:25.97]Apparently we're back.
[88:28.99]Oh boy.
[88:31.65]Let's go to servers.
[88:33.65]Favorites.
[88:36.77]View info.
[88:40.47]See if I can't get into this now.
[88:46.68]Hey, okay, I'm getting in.
[88:47.62]That was really weird.
[88:50.61]I hope it didn't... Oh, thank God it didn't turn off.
[88:54.99]Because it would have been... Oh, thank goodness.
[88:57.99]Thank goodness I was still here.
[89:00.67]Because what happens is, if the stream turns off, like, let's say if I turn off the stream, or if the stream gets turned off or kicked off, I have to... It's going to, like, upload whatever that was to YouTube, or it might just delete it.
[89:15.42]So...
[89:16.87]Good thing that didn't happen.
[89:18.13]I would have been muy muy mad.
[89:21.58]However you say that in Spanish.
[89:26.06]Now everything's lagging.
[89:27.72]Big time.
[89:28.18]Hold on, guys.
[89:31.58]Why is it doing this?
[89:33.46]It's like capping me at like 10 frames a second.
[89:36.74]Did my computer just like break?
[89:38.84]I hope not.
[89:40.10]Did we get to see like a live showing of Jerma's computer breaking?
[89:44.28]We actually may have.
[89:46.81]Hold on a second.
[89:50.29]I need to restart Team Fortress 2, I think.
[89:52.23]Nope, nope, we're good.
[89:53.17]We're good.
[89:53.47]I think we're back.
[89:55.87]Are we... Okay, that's better.
[89:57.71]That was really odd.
[90:00.31]Whoa, Scout is just like in the base.
[90:02.43]Scout in the base.
[90:02.97]Red Scout, Scout, Red Scout, Red Spy in the base.
[90:07.50]Alright.
[90:10.32]No, no, no, no.
[90:11.02]Get over here.
[90:14.68]Get over here.
[90:15.28]Chat, I can't see the chat.
[90:20.47]The heavy is oblivious.
[90:21.69]That heavy is a spy.
[90:25.71]Yeah, so I'm in my server.
[90:27.61]If you can get in.
[90:29.39]Hopefully I don't crash this time.
[90:31.03]Because that would be very, very annoying.
[90:34.64]Whoa, spy.
[90:37.38]You are still alive.
[90:39.86]Not on the point anymore, fortunately for you.
[90:46.42]How are you not on fire?
[90:47.56]How are you not on fire?
[90:49.20]Damn it.
[90:52.92]How are you not on fire?
[90:56.87]Loose Cannon.
[90:59.17]Yeah, I crashed.
[91:01.23]Sorry, guys.
[91:02.27]Let's get back out here.
[91:08.69]Get back out here.
[91:14.73]The bookshop.
[91:16.46]Where you pick up your favorite books.
[91:23.68]No.
[91:27.56]Gotta kill people, gotta kill people.
[91:28.86]Where is people?
[91:31.06]There's people.
[91:33.77]Let me... Do I have the stupid rake on?
[91:35.77]Good.
[91:36.09]I thought I had the rake on for a second.
[91:41.61]You... Where you going, where you going, where you going?
[91:45.35]No!
[91:46.61]Lag!
[91:50.73]No!
[91:51.23]God!
[91:51.95]If I just jump down the right, he's gonna die anyways.
[91:54.87]Yes.
[91:56.94]Yes.
[91:57.78]Alright, you want a beatbox?
[91:59.68]Alright, I guess I owe you guys a beatbox, because the last, like, 15 minutes of the stream has been all screwed up.
[92:04.68]So what do you guys want to hear?
[92:08.09]How about, uh, let's see.
[92:09.99]I'm trying to think of a good song to do.
[92:15.37]I'm taking requests.
[92:18.89]So a spy behind me kills me when the spy in front of me is a spy and the spy behind me is a spy.
[92:24.48]Great.
[92:31.82]Off to sleep.
[92:32.44]Have a nice day.
[92:33.74]Well, thank you.
[92:34.44]You have a nice day too.
[92:35.78]Hope you have a good sleep.
[92:39.49]What is... Can we get these guys out of the spawn?
[92:45.95]Come here, I'll put you out.
[92:48.07]Is that Pyro still here?
[92:51.19]What is MLP?
[92:52.13]MLP Intro Theme Song.
[92:53.53]I don't know what... What is... Is that a game?
[92:57.09]Oh, I know what that is.
[93:00.55]I don't know the theme song, but I do know what you're talking about, I think.
[93:06.41]Is it Major League Ponies?
[93:11.10]No, I actually do not watch that show.
[93:12.62]I do not know really anything about that show.
[93:15.51]But, yeah, I don't know the theme song for that show.
[93:19.33]Get sprayed!
[93:22.03]Spray, spray, spray.
[93:25.73]You are a spy!
[93:28.89]Spies on top of spies in front of your spies.
[93:33.75]There we go.
[93:34.11]I didn't get him with that?
[93:36.71]Give me a break.
[93:39.31]Beatbox the TF2.
[93:41.07]After we either win or lose this.
[93:44.01]I will.
[93:46.21]Come here, you!
[93:46.99]Come here, you!
[93:47.55]Can I get you around the corner?
[93:50.99]Where are you going?
[93:53.01]Oh, I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[93:55.23]Oh!
[93:55.73]Get him with that.
[93:58.03]You are a spy.
[93:58.65]No, you're not.
[94:02.69]Now he got me.
[94:05.22]Alright.
[94:06.70]Hmm.
[94:09.12]Yeah, I did already play gray.
[94:10.16]Some people were asking.
[94:12.36]It got really, really hard, and then I rage quit.
[94:14.68]That's essentially what happened.
[94:19.04]Here we go.
[94:23.22]What am I doing?
[94:26.36]Do you believe in magic?
[94:27.58]That's the pyro thing, right?
[94:29.50]How does it go?
[94:29.96]I gotta think how it goes.
[94:31.56]Do you believe in magic?
[94:33.94]In a young girl's... Alright, I think I can do it.
[94:41.45]Wait, actually, it's going to lag out right here, so I'm not going to do it yet.
[94:43.90]Hold on.
[94:44.70]Give it a second.
[94:45.62]Until we load up the new server, because it's going to go... Oh!
[94:57.10]Hello.
[94:58.32]I told you.
[94:58.82]I told you it was going to happen.
[95:00.58]See, it does that, like, ring of death, and then the thing, like, barely loads.
[95:05.11]I hate when that happens.
[95:06.03]I need more coffee.
[95:09.49]Okay, here we go.
[95:11.10]Do you believe in magic?
[95:12.32]I don't even know how it starts.
[95:23.16]Can we load the server, please?
[95:26.51]Ain't no sandwich when she's gone.
[95:28.29]Oh, here we go.
[95:30.53]I'm going to put a little twist on it this time.
[95:41.70]Oh, I'm like singing it.
[95:43.00]What am I doing?
[96:19.96]That was alright.
[96:21.06]I don't think that was my best work.
[96:24.43]Let's go random.
[96:25.93]Medic!
[96:29.37]Now I just can't stop doing it.
[96:30.99]I can't stop doing it.
[96:40.05]Why do I feel like this setup time has been a really long time?
[96:57.00]Maybe that's because it has been a really long time.
[97:01.92]You want a high five?
[97:03.06]Sure.
[97:05.84]Now I got nothing to drink.
[97:07.06]This is not good.
[97:12.55]The last bit of coffee.
[97:22.01]We want to high-five.
[97:24.69]If I had the high-five tone, I would do it.
[97:29.15]We are Ubering everybody.
[97:31.11]Oh, the spawn!
[97:31.81]Wait, it's a Kritzkrieg!
[97:34.47]Alright, well, it's a Kritzkrieg.
[97:35.68]I'm an idiot.
[97:36.80]I thought it was a regular Uber charge.
[97:39.80]Oh my god, I'm so stupid.
[97:42.76]I'm like, oh, Uber out of the gate.
[97:44.98]Everybody gets crits.
[97:46.13]It didn't work.
[97:46.71]What am I doing?
[97:48.65]Let's go.
[97:49.79]Strange everything.
[97:50.69]Here we go.
[97:55.27]Pokémon Center beatbox.
[97:56.49]I don't know what Pokémon... I don't know how that goes.
[98:00.34]I know how, like, the theme song goes, I think, at least.
[98:07.00]Push this guy.
[98:07.64]Push it, push it, push it, push it.
[98:19.47]Heals all around the block.
[98:25.67]No, no spy.
[98:27.69]Come here, you.
[98:30.90]Oh my goodness, it's a Pyro.
[98:36.44]Come here, you.
[98:38.96]Everybody heal to full health.
[98:40.62]There's a spy just around here.
[98:42.20]I keep smacking right into his body.
[98:49.62]Medic.
[98:51.16]Yep.
[98:51.68]Yep.
[98:53.37]We're on an absolute roll.
[98:59.11]Heal him up.
[98:59.61]Heal him up.
[99:01.27]You are not dead by any means necessary.
[99:07.82]The heals.
[99:08.62]The heals are literally everywhere.
[99:12.88]Watch it.
[99:13.26]Soldier.
[99:14.26]Soldier up top.
[99:14.90]Soldier up top.
[99:19.08]Gotta watch out for spies.
[99:22.22]You know, we'll take it up here.
[99:24.36]See if we can't... Oh, I wanted to kill him.
[99:32.23]Abso-positive-alutely.
[99:35.89]We got two heavy, cart heavies, whatever.
[99:42.05]See you later.
[99:42.65]Whoa, that guy just like teleported.
[99:44.23]Did you see that?
[99:46.07]That guy just launched into me and teleported.
[99:49.09]How am I not Ubering that guy?
[99:50.54]My beam was on his face.
[99:53.02]I got you, Heavy.
[99:55.10]Don't jump off.
[99:56.12]Thank you for the sandwich.
[99:57.00]You are such a gentleman.
[100:03.63]I got you.
[100:05.07]Let's go in for some smashes.
[100:06.39]Come here, Demo.
[100:07.69]Come here, man.
[100:09.61]Oh, come here.
[100:11.13]At least he jumped off the edge.
[100:13.39]That's the least.
[100:14.47]At least he did that.
[100:23.20]Oh, who's getting booted?
[100:25.78]I love just riding that.
[100:28.90]What?
[100:29.50]How did you do that, sir?
[100:32.38]Let's get up there.
[100:32.94]Let's get up there and win, huh?
[100:39.09]I don't think you are... Yes, you are.
[100:40.39]You're real.
[100:40.99]One of you is not real.
[100:42.91]No, we... Do we really have... Who was he?
[100:48.97]I didn't even get a chance to see that.
[100:50.05]Was that one of the heavies?
[100:51.72]Because there was like five heavies standing there.
[100:55.74]Jeez.
[101:01.06]Come here.
[101:04.35]Watch out for spies.
[101:07.75]Whoa!
[101:08.39]I'm killing this heavy right now.
[101:13.03]Oh!
[101:13.71]Come here!
[101:15.17]I got backstabbed?
[101:16.14]Are you serious?
[101:17.46]I got backstabbed instead of killed by the machine gun heavy.
[101:22.23]That's what I get.
[101:26.09]That's what I get for being an idiot.
[101:27.77]Okay, move in, move in, move in, move in.
[101:32.83]Cabot!
[101:34.09]Cabot!
[101:34.68]I got faith.
[101:35.52]I got faith in you guys.
[101:39.14]The cart has almost reached the final terminal.
[101:47.90]Yes!
[101:49.52]We did it.
[101:51.30]Am I a Pats fan?
[101:52.64]Hell yeah.
[101:53.84]I love the Patriots.
[101:54.58]It's too bad.
[101:55.30]The Patriots are not really doing so hot right now.
[101:59.56]They're having some issues.
[102:02.55]We'll just say that.
[102:05.27]Alright, this is going to be my last round.
[102:07.75]And I'm going to call it a night.
[102:08.89]Let's play Engineer.
[102:14.15]Who wants a high five?
[102:15.29]No, actually I can't do that yet.
[102:17.17]No, put this down.
[102:17.97]Go.
[102:19.98]I don't even know what I have.
[102:20.84]You know what?
[102:21.16]We can high five.
[102:22.26]Or I can just accidentally taunt.
[102:23.58]That's one thing.
[102:26.63]I have to build my sentry.
[102:27.47]I'm sorry.
[102:27.89]I can't give high fives.
[102:34.05]Yeah.
[102:36.21]Teleporter.
[102:37.05]Drop it.
[102:37.73]Everybody, you have to put the teleporter down.
[102:39.23]Please watch out.
[102:39.95]Don't get hurt.
[102:41.51]Here we go.
[102:43.21]If I wasn't an engineer, I would high five you guys.
[102:45.23]I'm sorry.
[102:49.33]Look at this sniper.
[102:56.22]I never like to put my sentry over here.
[102:58.80]I like down there.
[102:59.62]I always just feel so vulnerable when it's up there.
[103:05.58]Let's put it right here.
[103:07.96]Guys, excuse me.
[103:09.04]The sentry has to go up.
[103:13.29]I can't put my equipment anywhere.
[103:17.17]Smack.
[103:19.98]Get that teleporter.
[103:24.64]Get this to level three.
[103:26.46]Level three.
[103:28.76]Just saw, I think that was a spy that got behind us.
[103:32.14]It was.
[103:34.62]Oh, you're going to get smashed.
[103:37.54]Wow, one health.
[103:42.48]I shouldn't have gone after him.
[103:43.40]What am I thinking?
[103:45.32]Sentry's going to go down.
[103:46.41]Please don't go down.
[103:49.36]I should have built the teleporter first.
[103:51.26]Oh, my.
[103:53.38]Sentry down.
[103:56.64]Sentry is freaking down.
[103:57.84]You know what?
[103:58.50]No, we're staying Engineer.
[103:59.28]We're going to go Combat Engie, though.
[104:02.20]Because I ain't putting up stuff just for it to go down.
[104:06.99]Let's go.
[104:07.33]At least I got a crit.
[104:19.87]I was about to just dump this on my head, whatever it was.
[104:22.93]Right out of spawn.
[104:24.41]Are you kidding me?
[104:28.29]That's not going to happen again.
[104:29.87]That will not happen again.
