[00:08.27]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.95]Jerma here with my PAX Prime thoughts slash wrap-up slash I'm home slash that's a lot of slashes, but I'm at my house now.
[00:21.24]PAX Prime 2012 is officially over and I've been asleep all day.
[00:26.60]Right now it is 10 p.m.
[00:28.34]Eastern Time on Monday.
[00:30.28]My plane arrived on
[00:32.97]Today, on Monday, God, it's such a blur, at 7 in the morning, and I went to sleep right when I got home at like 8 or 9 p.m.
[00:41.76]So this whole day has been a blur, and I'm looking at the screen right now.
[00:49.93]This shirt is on backwards.
[00:52.43]This shirt has been on backwards this whole day.
[00:57.44]Oh my god.
[00:58.60]Well, you know what?
[00:59.18]Hey, sometimes you do things that you don't mean to, and that's one of those things.
[01:03.64]But anyways, I want to give a huge shout out to all the guys that I met at PAX Prime.
[01:08.95]All the guys, all the YouTubers, all the fans, everybody.
[01:12.37]It was such a great experience, guys.
[01:14.57]And if you have never been to a PAX, you gotta get to one.
[01:18.67]Even at any gaming convention, whether it be Quake, Cont, PAX, they're all just so much fun.
[01:22.13]You meet so many cool people there.
[01:24.09]And I wanted to kind of transition that into this little compilation of clips I have here.
[01:29.54]It's about maybe four or five minutes long, just a goofiness in the hotel rooms of us just hanging out, going to different booths, and that sort of thing.
[01:37.06]So that's what's going to start playing right now.
[01:39.34]But before that video kicks on, I want to talk about this really, really quickly.
[01:42.92]It's just a small little giveaway I'm doing, and the light's kind of in the way.
[01:46.30]So this is for a Artemis skin, an exclusive PAX Prime 2012 Artemis skin.
[01:51.73]If you do not have SMITE and you still want to try and get this, then by all means go for it.
[01:57.24]I actually have a beta key I can give you if you don't have a beta key.
[02:01.26]But yeah, it's for the Smite Artemis skin.
[02:04.04]So leave a comment on this video if you want this.
[02:06.42]And if you don't want to enter, then just simply write a regular comment.
[02:10.06]But if you want to enter, make sure you put Artemis skin, colon, and then whatever your comment is, just so I can more easily decipher through the different comments.
[02:19.42]But yeah, that's for a little skin there.
[02:21.10]I got an extra one, so I figured I'd give it away.
[02:23.46]And that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[02:24.72]So enjoy the little compilation of clips I have here.
[02:27.71]And of course, take care, everybody.
[02:34.52]So this is the, uh, this is the line to get in to Saks Prime.
[02:38.66]It's ridiculous.
[02:41.52]So many people here right now.
[02:43.24]I mean, of course we got Shibby 2142 here.
[02:45.02]Hi, guys.
[02:46.98]And Morgan.
[02:49.60]The link will be in the description for all of them.
[02:51.58]All these people.
[02:52.74]Everybody's link will be in the description.
[03:07.88]That's so cool.
[03:09.62]Anatomy of a creeper.
[03:10.82]Oh, it's his brain.
[03:14.80]It's a connected dual.
[03:19.67]Oh, that's so cool.
[03:24.59]It's crazy.
[03:35.80]How's that working out?
[03:38.29]What's right click?
[03:42.30]What's right click?
[03:43.22]A little Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[03:46.46]What is right click?
[03:47.34]I don't know.
[03:48.34]You have a German 985 going absolutely ham.
[03:52.12]Sniper would be a terrible choice for you.
[03:55.46]German, German, German.
[04:00.13]It's like insane.
[04:27.12]Wait, what?
[04:27.90]Willyrex, happy face.
[04:29.44]Willyrex, happy face.
[04:31.62]Jesus, I love you.
[04:34.29]Like, he's legit a rock star.
[04:36.81]What a boss.
[04:38.69]Willyrex, if you're watching this video, shout out to you.
[04:41.69]Shout out.
[04:42.05]That shit is all Spanish now.
[04:43.21]I can say, oh my god.
[04:45.40]No, it's like Iayuda.
[04:47.56]Really, no.
[04:48.64]That's not it.
[04:50.04]So this is day three.
[04:52.30]of PAX Prime in Seattle, Washington.
[04:54.30]I just wanted to show you guys the view because it's actually pretty crazy.
[04:57.62]It's right next to a highway.
[05:00.10]So I'm on the 20th floor, which is pretty damn high.
[05:05.23]It's crazy stuff.
[05:06.55]Look at all those cars, dude.
[05:09.67]But no, I'm about to check out of the hotel right now.
[05:13.32]We're going to the smite booth right now.
[05:16.22]Are you vlogging?
[05:17.22]What do you think this is?
[05:18.26]Stop, guys.
[05:19.18]What are you doing?
[05:20.44]We're going to be going to the smite.
[05:21.94]Is this Jermon?
[05:22.58]Is this Orb?
[05:23.39]No, wait.
[05:23.85]One of us is Orb and one of us is Jermon.
[05:25.53]That girl is really cute.
[05:27.11]Who?
[05:27.37]Who?
[05:27.57]Who?
[05:31.39]What?
[05:39.04]We got some free play Call of Duty happening over here.
[05:42.57]Incredible orb on the sticks.
[05:45.15]Phase cross on the sticks.
[05:46.71]Oh, he's on the sticks.
[05:47.59]It's getting nasty with the sniping in here.
[05:50.07]Watch this kid play.
[05:51.01]He's really good.
[05:52.25]I've seen him before on YouTube.
