[04:59.08]Okay, I'm ready whenever you guys are.
[05:12.32]You guys can just do a match without me, because I'm gonna be like 5-10 minutes behind.
[05:15.43]The tutorial is not long, hurry up.
[05:17.87]Alright, I just sat down!
[05:19.09]Alright, hold, view map, continue.
[05:24.82]Tutorial's cheating, man.
[05:26.36]Is it?
[05:27.91]Is it?
[05:29.35]It's very quick, though.
[05:31.35]It's really fast.
[05:33.23]British has been disabled.
[05:35.02]It does not work for anyone.
[05:37.55]Yeah, but Indian doesn't work either.
[05:39.41]I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[05:41.27]What does that mean?
[05:42.68]I don't know, like, if I could, like... Like, it understands an Indian accent and a British accent.
[05:51.33]I guess so.
[05:52.61]So you go like, lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.
[05:58.82]Yes, actually.
[06:00.48]Kind of.
[06:01.51]no let's confuse them guys it teaches you do crafting and then you can also shoot fire and stuff I don't understand the crafting at all to be honest I think you just throw random stuff together yeah you put it like frog plus log equals a frog spear but you have to put them on the bench together okay frog log yeah
[06:26.84]Vinny was showing us a gif of a frog log earlier.
[06:30.57]Oh, that was so fucking loud.
[06:32.21]Oh my god.
[06:33.19]What, was that me?
[06:36.09]No, that was in my game.
[06:37.83]That was unbearable for me.
[06:42.12]Was that not bad for everybody else watching?
[06:44.54]I didn't, oh.
[06:46.59]In order to cast spells, you must speak the proper incantation while flipped to the proper page of your spell book.
[06:54.09]Flip your spell book?
[06:57.16]Fireball.
[07:11.40]Freeze.
[07:13.61]Many years ago, when I was playing Skyrim by myself, like not on stream, I set up the mod that lets you say like, and it would cast it for you and felt like the hugest nerd in the world.
[07:25.55]Was it cool?
[07:26.49]You had fun?
[07:27.81]It was not cool.
[07:29.00]I did not feel cool at all, but the game had so many hotkeys, I felt like I had to do it.
[07:34.43]I didn't even know that was a mod.
[07:35.63]That sounds awesome.
[07:40.08]Magic missile!
[07:41.72]Squeaks, the code didn't work.
[07:43.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:43.66]Hang on, let me try something.
[07:44.91]Got it.
[07:45.21]Alright, gotcha.
[07:45.97]Alright, I know how to play the game.
[07:49.29]I got a lobby up, if you guys want to join it.
[07:52.70]Would be happy to.
[07:53.68]I could have beat the tutorial.
[07:55.46]Should we hide our screens?
[07:56.98]Or does it show a code or anything?
[07:58.16]I think it's hidden.
[07:59.58]I think we're good.
[08:01.03]I think it does show the code when you put it in.
[08:03.87]Yeah, hide screen.
[08:04.67]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:08.28]The tutorial was way too hard for me.
[08:11.98]It's so hard.
[08:13.04]I can't join the private lobby.
[08:15.95]Lobby is full.
[08:17.69]Wait, what?
[08:18.65]Lobby's full.
[08:19.31]Yeah, I don't even get a message.
[08:20.92]I can't even join.
[08:21.86]Lobby is full or has already started.
[08:26.12]Yeah, I get that too.
[08:27.80]What?
[08:35.91]What?
[08:36.13]What if we invited each other through Steam?
[08:38.27]I wonder if that's... Maybe that'd be easier.
[08:41.84]Want to make a new lobby?
[08:43.82]Sure.
[08:44.28]Yeah, someone else host then.
[08:47.24]Oh, no, we, uh... There's no way to invite.
[08:51.67]Not it.
[08:52.21]Okay, I'll try.
[08:56.19]Poke seems to work.
[08:58.10]Uh-oh.
[08:58.60]No, it does show the lobby.
[08:59.62]It does show the lobby code.
[09:00.92]Oh, brother.
[09:02.84]Oh, do we need to go back?
[09:04.07]Do we need to back out?
[09:04.91]Should I go back?
[09:06.93]Just join quick, and we fill it, don't we?
[09:10.34]No, I can't cap the size, so it's going to get full.
[09:13.14]So we should leave.
[09:14.10]Okay.
[09:15.54]I don't want people casting penis spells like what we're trying to play, you know?
[09:19.62]So it's better.
[09:20.36]Are there penis spells in the game?
[09:22.97]I don't know.
[09:23.27]I've never played before.
[09:24.17]They're going to do racist spells.
[09:25.71]I don't want to hear racist spells.
[09:27.35]Oh, God.
[09:27.71]Those aren't spells.
[09:28.59]Those are not spells.
[09:33.82]Those are the worst kind of spells.
[09:39.06]Oh, my God.
[09:42.33]Help rejoining.

[30:32.49]I was in the mausoleum.
[30:34.30]Oh, shit.
[30:35.40]Nice.
[30:36.16]I got books here.
[30:36.98]I think you dropped one.
[30:38.38]What's that?
[30:39.78]Take one of those.
[30:40.81]How do I use it?
[30:42.21]How do I learn it?
[30:44.45]You just say it out loud.
[30:45.65]Don't say it out loud on me, I guess.
[30:47.75]Okay.
[30:49.92]We got to go find Ster.
[30:50.86]He's cheating.
[30:51.38]I got a little wisp.
[30:53.35]Oh, don't.
[30:55.29]I'm standing back.
[31:01.54]How do I drop the book?
[31:14.26]Dude, I just said how do I drop the book?
[31:23.86]Dude, I died ten times.
[31:26.70]That was crazy.
[31:29.06]Are we playing again?
[31:29.64]Turn the game up in OBS.
[31:43.06]Dude, it is up.
[31:44.72]It is up, like, all the way.
[31:46.82]I will brain blast you guys if it goes up higher than this.
[31:49.09]...
[31:54.85]Oh no!
[32:01.43]Why'd I just leave- why'd I get kicked from the lobby?
[32:08.89]Is it the same code?
[32:10.93]Oh, heading to Discord, okay.
[32:13.92]Started running around yelling Excalibur and running people through.
[32:22.77]Dude, I found Vinny and he's just looking at me.
[32:28.02]He goes, magic missile?
[32:29.30]Like question mark.
[32:31.97]Absolutely pierce them.
[32:32.99]You guys want to try a Coliseum mode 1v1?
[32:34.73]Yeah, let's do it.
[32:38.29]Can we all join and do that?
[32:39.35]Or is it like... I guess so because I just kept killing people.
[32:43.35]It was like Monster Rancher.
[32:44.27]I kept killing my teammates.
[32:45.62]It's like Monster Rancher.
[32:49.88]Dude, what happened at the end?
[32:50.62]Did Jerma say, did he cast a spell that killed both of you?
[32:54.13]I don't know.
[32:54.45]It was so loud.
[32:55.27]It scared me.
[32:55.91]Did you hear me scream?
[32:57.29]I asked, how do I drop the book?
[32:59.82]And that was dark blast and killed all of us.
[33:08.19]Is that, we're going to, your lobby here, Puck?
[33:11.86]Yeah, I'm waiting for y'all.
[33:16.29]Oh, Vinny's deafened.
[33:18.50]Yeah, I was accused of being a hacker.
[33:21.62]It actually looked like you were hacking.
[33:31.62]Oh, we're ready.
[33:32.34]Oh, we're all in.
[33:33.22]Perfect.
[33:33.76]Let's mute.
[33:37.15]GG.
[33:47.56]Oh, we're the same teams as last time.
[33:49.81]Oh, wait, no, no.

[36:32.95]Oh, do we actually have teams?
[37:07.33]You have to enunciate.
[37:10.10]I got both headphones in.
[37:11.26]That is a debuff for me.
[37:14.81]I lose like 25% speed, 30% intelligence, and I drop every stat with headphones in.
[37:24.79]Oh shit.
[37:33.81]Fireball.

[39:52.59]I'm on your team, I'm on your team, I'm on your team.
[39:56.77]I definitely killed more than four people, it's just they put a fireball.
[40:27.84]I kept trying to kill Criken.
[40:34.55]Are we going back to Discord?
[40:35.49]I think so.
[40:42.54]So how was that?
[40:43.88]That was fun.
[40:45.70]That was fun.
[40:46.06]That was awesome.
[40:47.22]Fun night, everybody.
[40:47.82]Thank you.
[40:48.72]I had a lot of fun.
[40:49.60]GG.
[40:50.25]That was a blast.
[40:51.81]GG's.
[40:52.93]GG's, everyone.
[40:54.96]GG's, guys.
[40:55.52]We did it.
[40:55.86]10 minutes.
[40:56.82]That was actually 10 minutes.
[40:59.70]Was that really exactly 10?
[41:02.89]9.58?
[41:03.21]9.59?
[41:03.71]10 minutes, right there.
[41:06.61]We got it.
[41:09.19]Alright, thank you, Matrina, for sponsoring my stream.
[41:11.78]Thanks, guys, for playing with me.
[41:16.71]That'd be pretty fun.
[41:19.71]Okay, you guys actually done?
[41:21.81]Yeah, I think so.
[41:23.33]Alright.
[41:23.69]Cool.
[41:24.21]Alrighty.
[41:24.90]It was fun, guys.
[41:25.60]I really enjoyed gaming with you today.
[41:28.26]Yeah, likewise.
[41:29.25]It was a blast.
[41:30.01]Same here, guys.
[41:31.03]Yeah, thanks to all of you for coming out and putting up with all the homework and stuff, but hope you had fun.
[41:36.76]It's fun playing with Squeaks and Craig and you're all gonna...
[41:40.13]Gotta have, like, the horsemen.
[41:42.57]The cavalry type shit, you know?
[41:43.78]Yeah, the cavalry.
[41:46.56]I don't know what I'm saying, but... Yeah, we're gonna end up having, like, seven or eight horsemen.
[41:50.81]And all we're gonna end up doing is, guys, we're just gonna end up doing, like, the Smash Bros.
[41:55.53]thing, where it's just, like, a recolor of, like, the character.
[41:58.58]You know what I mean?
[41:59.22]We're gonna add members.
[42:01.76]Where did Ster... Did Ster bounce early?
[42:04.70]Yeah, he said he had to leave.
[42:06.18]He was mad.
[42:06.70]He said he was mad because Jerm was hacking.
[42:08.81]Okay, gotcha.
[42:09.49]Yeah, I comboed him like so bad.
[42:11.73]Actually, if you go back and look at the VOD, I fucking annihilated him.
[42:14.48]I bombed, I threw a fireball at his feet.
[42:16.84]He popped up.
[42:17.46]I froze him in the air.
[42:18.36]Magic mistletoe before he landed hit him with another fireball on the way down.
[42:20.95]And I know I'm explaining this like a five-year-old's telling a story, but this actually happened and he left again.
[42:29.00]Well, good for him.
[42:31.97]Alright.
[42:32.69]I'll talk to you guys soon.
[42:33.69]Thanks for hanging up.
[42:34.25]Bye.
[42:35.65]See you.
[42:39.68]Oh, that was a fun day.
[42:42.56]I think I'll probably call it right here too.
[42:44.45]I think I got what I wanted out of this stream.
[42:46.45]I think it was a lot of fun.
[42:48.41]I think we'll just kind of put a cap on it.
[42:51.58]Is anybody still going to be live?
[42:53.40]Everyone we were just with?
[42:54.98]Anyone still going?
[43:04.66]Is Vinny still streaming?
[43:07.10]Poke and Vinny?
[43:10.01]Squeaks?
[43:17.20]Vinny's going to be doing Donkey Kong?
[43:25.15]Oh my god, I'm yawning on stream.
[43:26.43]I started to yawn and I immediately was like, don't do that.
[43:29.62]I just stopped it.
[43:33.41]Yeah, so I said Omega Gaming Week, but the results came back to determine that that was a lie.
[43:42.68]Whoa, yeah, holy shit.
[43:44.38]I just jumped out of the chair.
[43:47.51]I'll be live on Friday.
[43:49.37]So not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow.
[43:53.37]So, well, we will still do like three streams this week.
[43:56.88]I did say I want to do three or four streams this week.
[43:59.20]So we'll probably do Friday and Saturday, Friday and Sunday.
[44:02.32]We got something really cool going on on Friday morning.
[44:05.37]Friday stream is going to be very early.
[44:08.63]That's going to be like an 11 a.m.
[44:10.80]Pacific start stream because we're going to be hanging out with the House Slipper devs.
[44:18.20]The House Slipper devs are going to join us.
[44:21.64]And for like a half an hour.
[44:23.63]It'll be part of a much larger stream that I'll do.
[44:26.07]I'll play some other stuff.
[44:27.63]But, yeah, we're going to do like a Q&A with the devs.
[44:33.47]I apologize, mods, because I'm about to talk about the Discord channel.
[44:37.70]So, you know...
[44:39.68]Just don't be an idiot.
[44:41.02]Don't go in there and just write, like, pee-pee-poo-poo.
[44:42.77]You're going to get banned.
[44:43.85]Ban them if they do that.
[44:45.49]There's a Discord channel right now for the Q&A.
[44:49.78]If you have a question that you want to ask the House Flipper team...
[44:54.11]this is your opportunity to ask it.
[44:55.41]There's a lot of questions already, but, um, we're just going to, and we only have about 30 minutes.
[44:59.60]So, but if you really do have like a, Hey, I actually want to ask this, um, then you can use that channel.
[45:05.82]It is the house slipper QA channel.
[45:08.11]I know my Discord is pretty much not really active anymore, but it's good to use it for stuff like this.
[45:13.75]So that's Friday morning.
[45:16.82]And that is going to be it for me.
[45:20.08]Um,
[45:23.71]You said Vinny was still going?
[45:24.77]Well, we'll raid Vinny.
[45:35.04]Keep growing your hair?
[45:36.37]It's probably, uh, dude, somebody called my beard disgusting.
[45:39.71]I don't disagree.
[45:40.55]That's the funny, that's why I laugh so hard at it.
[45:45.54]Yeah, go say hello to Vinny, even though you just saw him.
[45:49.70]Um...
[45:53.07]But yeah, that was a really fun day.
[45:55.21]I'm glad people liked it.
[45:58.38]Anytime you do something like that where I'm not really sure how it's going to go, it's like, hey, this sounds kind of interesting that I would like to try to do.
[46:06.51]There's always the fear that it, oh, actually, people weren't really into that.
[46:11.89]But it sounds like everybody that played had a good time.
[46:14.82]So that's good for me to think and see because I'm just happy people had fun.
[46:24.54]I think it was a great tournament.
[46:25.36]We'll do it again.
[46:25.84]I think we can do another couple of brackets.
[46:31.75]Again, that was a lot of that was LegendCup.com.
[46:35.44]They helped out so much.
[46:36.50]You have no idea.
[46:37.16]They saved the entire tournament.
[46:39.08]I know I've shouted them out a few times here, but if you are a fan of Monster Rancher, it's a very active community.
[46:47.76]People are still doing it.
[46:48.54]It's a really fun game if you thought that was fun, if you've never really seen it before.
[46:52.79]It's a really fun, just cool, raise a monster.
[47:00.07]So thanks to the, that group, that team that helped a lot of that.
[47:05.70]So yeah, I'll see you guys on Friday, Friday morning, early.
[47:13.18]And we'll stream for the better half of the day too.
[47:15.40]I'll go from like probably 11 to at least like probably 4 to 6 hours.
[47:19.78]I'm going to start with a 30 minute house flip for Q&A.
[47:23.70]And I'll see you then.
[47:25.35]And then we'll stream on the weekend too.
[47:27.29]I did say Omega Gaming Week.
[47:28.69]So there needs to be at least 3 streams.
[47:34.95]Alright.
[47:35.30]Go raid Vinny.
[47:40.68]Have a good one.
[47:41.20]Take care.
[47:42.00]See you soon.
[47:43.85]Follow your mother.
[48:29.23]you
