[00:13.79]What's up?
[00:25.09]Oh, should I have to mute myself in here?
[00:26.50]I don't know how to do that.
[00:28.96]Hold on.
[00:29.24]Alright, I think I know how to do it.
[00:32.76]Okay, I think I'm muted in the game.
[00:35.76]How you doing?
[00:36.30]Hi, everybody.
[00:40.62]Welcome.
[00:44.55]Welcome to a VR stream.
[00:48.34]You know, I made a few promises and I'm gonna keep those promises.
[00:58.42]So what we're doing today is we're gonna act a little bit sus today.
[01:07.00]I'm playing Among Us VR.
[01:09.78]The sus guy is finally fucking gonna stream this game.
[01:12.48]I hope you're ready.
[01:14.47]I've rebranded the whole channel.
[01:15.89]And no, I didn't put any sub badges in because I know what you guys would do.
[01:21.09]You would go to every channel on Twitch and ruin the whole website.
[01:25.56]So we're not doing that today.
[01:26.98]There's tons of BT TV emotes.
[01:33.34]Why not?
[01:34.45]Because it would be a disaster.
[01:37.59]And on my mics, I'm still, I got COVID still.
[01:44.11]So I've never played this game.
[01:45.21]I did the tutorial really quickly.
[01:47.89]So all I know is that if I'm in the imposter, I have to kill people.
[01:53.45]And if I'm a crewmate, then I have to stop the imposter from killing everybody.
[01:57.45]Is everybody ready to get sus?
[01:58.53]I think we're still setting the lobby up, but hi.
[02:06.76]He did the tutorial, yeah.
[02:12.63]Hold on.
[02:13.07]And this is one day only, by the way.
[02:14.25]I'm not doing this ever again.
[02:15.09]Make sure I tweet this.
[02:22.30]Yeah, I ain't ever doing this ever again.
[02:26.20]Every emote that you're spamming right now, everything that you're doing, every single joke that you're making is not going to be allowed as of tomorrow.
[02:34.61]One day only.
[02:38.03]Watch me be really good at this game.
[02:48.89]It's only a one day event, it really is, yeah.
[02:54.33]I have to make sure I don't show the lobby code too.
[02:57.05]So the lobby I'm in right now, it's Kryken, Vinny, Ross, there's a bunch of people in here.
[03:05.26]And I think we're just kind of chilling, waiting to start.
[03:09.56]I'm muted right now in the game.
[03:11.89]But I'm gonna annoy- I'm gonna annoy the fuck out of everybody in this lobby, I can already tell you.
[03:20.02]I think- I think I'm- is something wrong?
[03:21.58]Something- I think I'm breaking the game or something.
[03:29.70]Yeah, they're talking to me in the game.
[03:31.34]Hold on.
[03:32.60]Alright, so it's time to get sus!
[03:37.19]Can you guys hear them?
[03:37.75]Alright, what's going on over here?
[03:43.10]I gotta make sure I don't show the room code, hold on.
[03:47.28]Oh good, we got 10 subs!
[03:48.96]We got way more than 10.
[03:54.12]Hold on.
[03:55.20]I don't want to show the lobby.
[03:57.02]Hold on.
[03:57.68]Okay.
[03:58.10]Hey everybody, what's going on?
[04:02.04]It's me, the sus guy!
[04:11.31]I'm doing the Deadpool voice.
[04:13.17]Alright, hold on.
[04:14.27]Before, I gotta make sure you can't see the lobby code.
[04:17.03]Because that's a really important thing.
[04:19.96]First of all, I gotta unmute myself here.
[04:21.44]Okay, I'm currently unmuted.
[04:24.54]I'm currently... I'm ready.
[04:26.83]I'm gonna stare at a wall, though, because I don't want to look at the room code.
[04:31.20]Okay, so here we go.
[04:32.24]Hold on, I can turn- You apparently can turn off the hands disappearing.
[04:36.40]Oh!
[04:37.38]Oh my god, you can- Yes, you can.
[04:42.73]Okay.
[04:43.03]Hey.
[04:43.75]Don't show the room code.
[04:44.77]Fucking idiot.
[04:47.71]I can't- I can't be trusted, I really can't.
[04:49.09]I have to just look at the wall.
[04:49.99]Something's in my eye already.
[04:51.03]How did something get in my eye?
[04:52.72]Ah!
[04:52.80]Oh, this is pretty sus!
[05:04.22]How do I change my name?
[05:06.12]Okay.
[05:06.36]Do I have to do that in the main menu?
[05:08.62]Hi, guys.
[05:08.96]No, no, no.
[05:09.70]You go to the settings menu, right?
[05:12.32]And then you go to gameplay, and then you scroll down one on the right, and then you unclick hide my username.
[05:18.18]Let's go.
[05:19.32]Oh, I got you.
[05:20.32]Okay.
[05:20.70]I don't want to see the room code.
[05:22.26]Yes, I believe I can.
[05:23.18]Hi, everybody.
[05:23.84]Hi, guys.
[05:24.20]Hello.
[05:27.44]What's up?
[05:27.90]Are you ready to play some Among Us?
[05:31.36]I'm ready.
[05:32.12]Alright.
[05:34.42]You look kinda cool.
[05:36.92]Where am I?
[05:37.66]There we go.
[05:38.66]He's tiny.
[05:41.47]So how do you play?
[05:44.15]Anybody know how to play this game?
[05:47.21]I didn't play the tutorial, man.
[05:48.55]I have no idea.
[05:49.29]So you just point?
[05:51.73]You just point?
[05:52.45]Yeah, you can point.
[05:53.23]It's pretty nice.
[05:53.92]Oh yeah, you can point.
[05:55.02]That's what you do.
[05:56.38]So how do we, is it just, do we just roll dice and who gets to play as, you know, the imposter?
[06:03.11]Pretty much.
[06:03.59]Ever played D&D?
[06:04.04]It's kind of like that.
[06:05.30]Oh my God, you make a triangle.
[06:07.34]Do we get to roll who gets to be the imposter or does it just pick a random person?
[06:12.32]How many people do we have?
[06:13.64]It's other people over here.
[06:14.52]Hey!
[06:14.70]Oh, I just... It's me.
[06:15.30]One day only, by the way.
[06:36.84]This is the only day we can call you Susky?
[06:39.00]This is the only day I'm going to allow it.
[06:41.28]Are you ready to get kicked out first every single round?
[06:43.96]Because it's literally the only bit.
[06:46.81]Sorry.
[06:52.50]This thing's too tight.
[06:53.90]This thing's too tight on my hands.
[06:56.46]It's making my hand shake.
[06:58.49]There we go.
[06:59.93]That's better.
[07:01.25]Are we ready to rock and roll?
[07:06.63]Are we ready to rock and roll?
[07:08.07]Hey, and by the way, subscriptions are appreciated.
[07:16.84]Today?
[07:19.10]I don't even know how to do this.
[07:22.75]I feel so fucking out of my element right now.
[07:25.45]I'm going to be very honest.
[07:26.23]I feel like I shouldn't be here.
[07:27.69]I appreciate that.
[07:42.11]Tell everybody!
[07:43.17]Remember!
[07:44.18]Why are any of us on the space station?
[07:46.62]It's true.
[07:47.14]Hey, you know what?
[07:48.28]Thank you.
[07:48.90]How about let's establish some backstory.
[07:50.46]What are we all doing here?
[07:51.44]Thank you, Vinny.
[07:52.12]Let's start with you.
[07:52.72]Okay.
[07:53.04]What are you doing here?
[07:54.22]I think I'm sent to do the, um, Arboretum.
[07:57.97]I want to regrow the plants and crops.
[07:59.81]He's in Arboretum.
[08:00.41]Very good.
[08:01.21]Would you like to join me in this charboard?
[08:03.21]Of course, yeah.
[08:03.87]I have a side objective, though.
[08:05.11]I'm killing everybody regardless of if I'm imposter or not.
[08:08.80]So keep that in mind as we move forward, everyone.
[08:10.82]Are we playing right now?
[08:11.96]We're just establishing some, like, stakes, you know, before we get into that.
[08:17.14]Oh, I thought we were playing right.
[08:18.59]I thought somebody was already the imposter.
[08:23.87]We could be.
[08:24.43]We could decide who's the imposter.
[08:26.01]Okay.
[08:26.55]Regardless.
[08:27.49]Yeah, we could.
[08:28.07]If you so desire.
[08:28.99]Yeah.
[08:29.93]This is great.
[08:30.75]It's like high school all over again.
[08:34.06]I mean, aside from sus guy trying to get subs.
[08:39.40]Dude, if you go to my story.
[08:41.06]Oh, go ahead.
[08:41.44]Sorry, I don't want to cut anybody off.
[08:44.06]I'm the captain of a previous vessel that crashed, and I was abandoned on a space station, and I had to say goodbye to my loved ones.
[08:53.50]And I got abducted by this one.
[08:55.50]And I'm trying to prove to you all I'm the captain.
[08:57.36]But actually, I don't have any credentials with me.
[09:00.14]Aren't you the guy who crashed his last spaceship?
[09:03.32]That's the thing.
[09:04.52]Hold on a second.
[09:05.64]I'll do better this time.
[09:08.12]Are you related to Tinky Winky from the Teletubbies?
[09:11.10]I'll never tell.
[09:12.24]Okay.
[09:15.26]That looks awfully like a TV there in the middle of your screen.
[09:18.22]Yeah, maybe we're all just weird.
[09:20.74]My TV's just my eyes, actually.
[09:25.84]Alright.
[09:26.40]Are we ready to rock and roll?
[09:27.47]Are we ready to rock?
[09:28.99]Yeah, we're ready to rock.
[09:30.07]Anyone else that wants to join, they'll join in the next round.
[09:32.45]Okay.
[09:33.01]Yeah, yeah.
[09:33.99]Good luck, everybody.
[09:34.77]Good luck.
[09:36.99]Hey.
[09:38.09]Be careful.
[09:38.73]If I'm the imposter, I'm killing you first.
[09:41.63]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[09:42.63]Shh.
[09:46.69]Oh, I, oh, wait, oh, wait, don't say any sounds.
[09:49.80]We can still hear everybody.
[09:51.16]Oh, shh.
[09:52.96]Hi, everybody.
[09:53.70]I'm muting.
[09:54.16]Mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.
[09:55.50]I'm a crewmate.
[09:57.00]What do I do when my screen is red and has a kill?
[09:59.22]What does the kill button do?
[10:00.46]Now we have to figure out how to do tasks.
[10:03.68]Hey!
[10:04.36]Yeah, don't mind me, guys.
[10:05.29]He's red.
[10:05.91]Get away from me.
[10:06.55]Oh, my God, this is so weird.
[10:12.05]What do we have to do?
[10:12.71]Where am I?
[10:13.43]Oh, there's missions, right.
[10:14.33]Like, I'm just trying to do my task, but now I'm tall because I'm standing, but if I'm sitting, I'm too small.
[10:19.17]Vinny, I'm coming with you.
[10:20.17]I feel like if this is... What are we doing here, Liam?
[10:21.51]Are we pumping?
[10:22.37]We're doing tasks.
[10:22.93]We gotta pump.
[10:23.67]Pump it?
[10:24.07]How do you pump?
[10:25.37]Uh, with your hands.
[10:26.50]Don't stand so close to me.
[10:27.64]My big yaoi hands?
[10:28.88]I don't know how to do this.
[10:32.00]Pretend I never said that.
[10:33.54]Yeah, I'm just gonna overlook that.
[10:36.08]I got it.
[10:36.48]Grab with the trigger and then pump, pump, pump.
[10:38.80]I did it.
[10:39.08]Okay.
[10:40.10]Unless you're sus.
[10:42.25]No, no, no, no.
[10:43.13]I got it now.
[10:43.79]I got it.
[10:44.31]Oh, fuck.
[10:45.59]I'm muted.
[10:46.05]I forgot.
[10:48.49]I've been muted this whole time.
[10:49.81]Ah!
[10:56.37]Shit
[11:18.80]So nobody can hear me.
[11:19.88]I said I was gonna kill him first, by the way.
[11:21.70]That's the funniest part about this.
[11:26.48]My first game ever, I fucking die immediately within 15 seconds.
[11:48.28]Fifteen seconds.
[11:49.20]Get rid of him.
[11:52.74]Get rid of him.
[11:55.00]Get rid of him.
[11:56.22]I'm the ghost of the fucking sus guy, and I'm going to make sure they pick you.
[12:08.56]Did I play wrong there?
[12:10.44]No way.
[12:10.68]He's going to get voted out.
[12:12.48]Get rid of him.
[12:13.28]Who are they voting for?
[12:40.00]That was so funny.
[12:41.50]That was so funny.
[12:42.44]I mean, I was literally pointing in your face saying, I'm gonna kill you first, and you fucking killed me in ten seconds.
[13:07.07]Do you hear them sounding like ghosts?
[13:09.37]Yeah.
[13:10.43]Like, we're the ghosts, but they sound so weird.
[13:13.86]So they can't hear us right now.
[13:15.74]No, they can't hear us.
[13:18.60]I figured the best way to get you acclimated to Among Us was to kill you instantly.
[13:22.79]Yeah.
[13:25.39]This game's kind of fun.
[13:28.21]Yeah, it's going to be good.
[13:30.01]We just have to betray each other and then, like, you know, ruin friendships, and it'll be great.
[13:35.50]Yeah, that's alright.
[13:40.98]So who's the other imposter?
[13:44.97]I don't know, actually.
[13:47.49]Oh, it doesn't show you?
[13:50.83]It might.
[13:51.39]I don't know how to find that information.
[13:52.97]Oh, we have tasks.
[13:55.18]Oh shit.
[13:55.64]How do we do- how do we do tasks?
[13:58.02]Okay.
[13:58.20]Oh, there's a task in here.
[14:13.29]Alright, so let's do some tasks.
[14:14.83]Let me get acclimated by this.
[14:16.07]How does this work?
[14:16.87]Okay, so what do I have to do?
[14:19.34]Yeah, well, we're dead.
[14:20.06]We can't do tasks.
[14:21.24]I'm dead, guys.
[14:23.88]I'm dead.
[14:24.92]What's happening?
[14:25.48]Did you vote for me?
[14:28.08]I did not.
[14:28.90]I skipped vote.
[14:29.79]I'm sorry.
[14:30.35]Did I do it?
[14:33.35]Did I do it?
[14:34.71]You do tasks.
[14:35.81]Do tasks, people are saying.
[14:37.07]Liars, do tasks.
[14:38.13]What, really?
[14:38.79]We can do tasks when we're dead.
[14:40.17]How do you do this?
[14:41.11]I guess you do.
[14:42.17]Yeah, you can contribute.
[14:44.47]Alright, I'm going to... I'm going to go navigation.
[14:48.65]Okay, I have to do something with data.
[14:51.83]You can't... What happened?
[15:02.39]I'm going to do my tasks.
[15:06.11]I gave up dead instantly.
[15:07.43]That's so funny.
[15:08.65]That's absolutely poetic.
[15:09.87]Alright, we're gonna head this way.
[15:14.87]That's a fucking imposter.
[15:16.07]I guarantee it.
[15:16.85]Yeah, there's no task done in here.
[15:21.91]There's an imposter right there.
[15:28.49]Did I fail it?
[15:31.13]Oh, I see.
[15:31.61]I gotta get it right in the middle.
[15:37.04]Done.
[15:42.28]Was he talking to?
[15:43.70]Oh, we're all streaming.
[15:45.64]I forgot.
[15:49.43]I completely forgot.
[15:50.71]Everybody's streaming right now.
[15:54.93]What else is there to do?
[16:00.13]You know, I feel like it's hard to get people alone, right?
[16:05.09]You have to get somebody kind of going down like a hall.
[16:30.91]True, that's true.
[16:32.51]And you have to be the very worst version of yourself.
[16:35.25]Yeah.
[16:35.83]Like, you have to be the sus guy.
[16:38.31]Oh, don't worry, I'm ready.
[16:40.83]I mean, if anybody in this lobby ever wants to talk to me again, I understand, you know what I mean?
[16:49.44]If you want someone to trust you, says a chat member, absolutely do not say you can trust me.
[16:53.74]That works.
[16:59.52]You've become the sus guy.
[17:01.64]Well, I mean, you kind of already sound like him.
[17:04.44]I mean, I kind of sound like him.
[17:07.67]Because I am him.
[17:09.03]Somebody said, hit the Luddy?
[17:11.69]Alright, how do you do it?
[17:17.09]Oh, so we can sabotage.
[17:18.96]When they start going again, if you use your map, you can click on... Oh, well, you can still do tasks because you're a regular... That's zero practice, by the way.
[17:34.57]this is bizarre hearing their voices like this is yes feels weird sorry over there's like my head's under water oh what imposter got depleted
[17:57.23]I didn't know where I was when the lights went off.
[18:22.29]It was a little spooky.
[18:25.59]It was a little scary.
[18:29.61]We were all scared.
[18:31.15]Maybe his body just did that.
[18:33.87]Have we considered that?
[18:35.15]Who is it?
[18:36.33]Who killed you?
[18:39.17]I don't know.
[18:39.61]Who killed you?
[18:40.37]Oh, Vinny.
[18:40.91]Maybe it was natural causes.
[18:43.36]Maybe heart fatigue or something.
[18:45.14]I only killed you, Jerma.
[18:47.42]I killed you and they immediately sussed me out.
[18:49.64]In a room that's that way.
[18:52.08]It scared the absolute shit out of me, too.
[18:53.77]I was not expecting it at all.
[18:56.33]I was like, oh, I can trust Vinny.
[18:57.68]I'm gonna, like, follow Vinny.
[18:58.78]I said, well, I was muted, but that's what I was saying.
[19:02.52]No, that was perfect.
[19:03.24]Oh, okay.
[19:03.60]Yeah!
[19:29.59]Achievement!
[19:32.91]I got an achievement.
[19:33.92]Play again, right?
[19:38.02]Don't look at the lobby.
[19:38.94]Okay, I won my only game of Among Us Impostor.
[19:41.26]I'm going to quit now.
[19:44.51]I got my one win.
[19:45.61]No, okay.
[19:47.05]The one win.
[19:48.49]It's awful.
[19:50.24]Don't look at the code.
[19:50.92]You feel the guilt.
[19:51.90]You feel the guilt.
[19:53.04]It's terrible.
[19:54.86]You hit the Yankee Splanky?
[19:56.36]Alright.
[19:56.82]I was in a room alone with you, and I felt bad.
[19:59.92]You did a very good job, though.
[20:01.22]You did an insane job, because we didn't even vote for you in the first round.
[20:04.34]Yeah, I'm very surprised.
[20:06.04]How about the hit the sussy?
[20:07.80]You got it.
[20:09.32]I can turn everything down.
[20:10.21]How's that better?
[20:38.15]Does that sound better?
[20:38.83]Better?
[20:39.11]Better?
[20:39.31]Okay.
[20:39.49]Hide the room code?
[20:40.66]Oh.
[20:40.80]Thank you.
[20:41.90]The other one is like, was it on the ceiling or on the floor?
[20:44.74]Yo, yo, yo.
[20:46.04]Dab me up.
[20:46.46]Dab me up.
[20:46.88]I could do it right here.
[20:47.78]You got it.
[20:48.16]Yeah, good dab.
[20:48.76]Good dab.
[20:49.24]Good dab.
[20:49.54]I gotta psych myself up.
[20:50.52]Okay, maybe not like that.
[20:51.36]You're positive.
[21:10.59]If you get imposter, you're gonna fucking do it, man.
[21:12.87]Yeah, this is pretty good.
[21:13.49]Like an imposter.
[21:14.47]Oh, I don't know what happened.
[21:15.63]I don't know.
[21:16.09]Yeah, he died.
[21:17.13]He fell down and he fell down.
[21:18.05]I don't know what happened.
[21:18.75]He hit his head.
[21:20.18]I got it.
[21:20.50]What's up?
[21:21.44]How you doing over here?
[21:22.36]A little weird that you're talking alone.
[21:24.60]I'm just, I was trying to, you know, figure out what I want to be and do.
[21:28.58]Okay.
[21:29.10]Okay, just making sure.
[21:30.94]Yeah.
[21:31.14]I'll trust him.

[21:32.60]I'm trying.
[21:33.00]I'm trying.
[21:33.42]Hey, how do I hide the room code?
[21:35.59]Splash your nose in your head.
[21:36.89]Oh, uh, ooh.
[21:38.07]Jerm.
[21:40.12]I've been looking at the ground.
[21:42.42]Gameplay?
[21:44.46]And then scroll down?
[21:45.92]Will it show it if I look at the screen?
[21:48.26]I like the little moving in place.
[21:49.95]It's so funny.
[21:50.95]Gameplay?
[21:51.31]Okay.
[21:51.57]Okay.
[21:51.71]I don't think I showed it.
[21:52.61]I've been looking down.
[21:53.43]I tried to walk over to my water in VR.
[21:54.79]Hold on.
[21:55.17]No, that's not how that works.
[21:56.03]Oh, I got a drink too.

[23:23.61]It's always good to be numb while playing Among Us VR, I've noticed.
[23:27.29]Oh, boy.
[23:28.39]Are you Jolly?
[23:29.41]So far.
[23:29.93]No, I feel good, though.

[24:22.30]Nice to meet you, too.
[24:23.52]Nice to meet you, too.
[24:24.30]We should be the first in Among Us VR to have a cool handshake.
[24:28.34]Yeah.
[24:28.65]No, wait.
[24:29.19]Are they doing that or are we doing that?
[24:30.35]Wait.
[24:31.98]Oh, I thought you were talking to me.
[24:35.20]Sorry, I'm almost 40.
[24:36.79]Ready?

[24:42.46]It's how you high five.
[24:43.42]It's a good shot.
[24:44.28]This is a good shot.
[24:45.90]Grandpa.
[24:46.32]Pretend we're not here.
[24:47.63]Pretend we're not here.
[24:48.23]Pretend we're not here.
[24:49.39]You guys are in your element right now.
[24:50.77]I took off my headset.
[24:51.47]Have you ever been turkey'd before?
[24:52.73]You know what turkey is?
[24:55.01]Oh, is that when you go to fist bump?
[24:56.73]How many people do we have?
[24:57.79]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[24:59.81]We got nine people?
[25:00.65]You go turkey and yell turkey.
[25:01.82]First person to turkey in Among Us we are.
[25:06.23]You can't hear it, but I'm clapping.
[25:07.37]You have to yell turkey.
[25:08.05]Oh, I see it.
[25:08.81]I get it.
[25:09.75]Turkey.
[25:10.41]Wow.
[25:11.39]Great work, everyone.
[25:13.95]Great work.
[25:14.53]Every single person over there.
[25:16.88]We move.
[25:17.32]You better be ready.
[25:18.32]Wait, no, no.
[25:18.68]Because if I get imposter this round, first time ever, it's going to be gun over.
[25:27.14]Ow.
[25:27.28]I hope I didn't kick anybody out.
[25:29.02]Oh, no, no, no.
[25:29.62]We did lose.
[25:29.98]We lost Kony.
[25:31.48]Oh, I got to change this.
[25:32.38]Are we good to rock and roll?
[25:33.14]Here we go.
[25:40.93]Who is he talking to?
[25:47.03]I'm talking to you guys.
[25:48.07]I'm talking to the chat room.
[25:50.39]Why did I just say it like that?
[25:51.31]It's really taken over.
[25:52.05]How many subs do we have so far?
[25:55.23]How many subs?
[25:56.01]Let's see.
[25:57.25]I don't know.
[25:58.55]At least 10?
[26:00.05]I have to update that.
[26:01.31]Hey!
[26:03.04]Hey.
[26:03.42]What's happening?
[26:03.97]This stream totally isn't going the way you thought it was going to go, is it?
[26:07.75]Well, I died in 10 seconds, the first round ever.
[26:11.53]It was not.
[26:13.85]It's impossible to have a conversation with anybody, especially your chat room.
[26:19.60]So what do you want to talk about in the three seconds that we have together?
[26:22.50]Here we go.
[26:24.56]Here we go.
[26:25.24]Good luck.
[26:25.78]Alright.
[26:27.40]Good luck, everybody.
[26:30.78]I'm taking a mental note of where every single fucking person goes.
[26:38.62]WHAT?!
[26:38.78]I thought somebody killed me!
[26:39.64]I was like, how?
[26:58.01]Don't really have like two emergency meetings
[27:18.72]How many emergency meetings?
[27:19.54]How do we skip?
[27:20.38]I am skipping.
[27:20.90]I'm skipping.
[27:21.42]I'm telling you, you gotta see where everybody walks, right?
[27:23.66]Somebody goes that way, somebody goes that way, somebody goes that way.
[27:27.18]Just watch.
[27:48.89]what do you think it would have been okay uh... alright I'm skipping the I'm going to be the uh... I'm skipping I'm skipping I'm still growing up in a bad that I think that it may be what I want to do that uh... what uh...

[28:22.85]Somebody follow him.
[28:25.50]You two.
[28:27.20]Somebody follow Blue.
[28:28.26]Is this like a choice that you've made to be mute?
[28:32.32]Vinny and Liam, you follow Kryken.
[28:36.77]Okay.
[28:38.09]I got my eyes on Blue.
[28:39.17]He can't speak, but I'm sure he agrees.
[28:41.41]Alright.
[28:43.05]I'm coming with you guys.
[28:46.15]Don't leave me alone with... Why am I going that way?
[28:47.93]Don't leave me alone with Vinny.
[28:49.13]Wait, what?
[28:51.59]Oh, shit.
[28:53.57]What do I do?
[28:54.10]Oh, okay.
[28:55.26]Straight.
[28:57.24]Oh, my... It sucks.
[29:07.32]Can I fight back?
[29:09.16]Hey, what's up?
[29:11.64]What's going on?
[29:14.62]I've never played this game.
[29:16.22]I don't know what room is what room.
[29:19.47]I was going to navigation because I want it.
[29:21.05]I'm going to navigation.
[29:23.37]No, you guys, two of you come with me if you want.
[29:24.77]It's fine.
[29:26.65]But I want you to get in front of me.
[29:29.93]Sure, sure.
[29:30.41]You know what?
[29:31.25]I got nothing to prove.
[29:31.89]I got nothing to hide.
[29:32.67]Go ahead.
[29:33.23]We can watch the door.
[29:34.27]We'll watch the door.
[29:34.95]You take care of your tasks.
[29:36.07]No one's coming through this.
[29:37.10]You're safe.
[29:37.58]It's these two.
[29:38.24]It's definitely these two.
[29:39.50]It's these two.
[29:40.38]It's definitely these two.
[29:41.36]It's definitely these two.
[29:42.26]It's these two.
[29:42.96]No.
[29:43.36]It's these two.
[29:44.32]It's these two.
[29:45.62]Help.
[29:46.80]I found imposters.
[29:48.04]I found the imposters.
[29:49.48]I found them.
[29:50.90]I found the imposter.
[29:53.10]I don't know what room I'm in.
[29:56.93]What?
[29:57.51]No.
[29:59.99]I won't tell anybody.
[30:01.25]I won't tell anybody.
[30:01.77]Just let me live.
[30:02.31]You're fine for now.
[30:05.43]Alright.
[30:05.81]Okay, okay, okay.
[30:07.67]We're good.
[30:09.03]We're good.
[30:10.49]Oh, shit.
[30:15.01]Emergency!
[30:16.49]Emergency meeting!
[30:18.20]Emergency meeting!
[30:19.96]Where am I?
[30:23.52]Hey!
[30:23.86]Hold on.
[30:24.74]Wait a second.
[30:37.31]listen I was I was walking around I don't I don't I don't know how to play this game right and oh I forgot their names okay so uh what's your name green here and what's your name
[30:54.74]Green and yellow cornered me.
[30:57.14]Alright, green and yellow.
[30:58.28]It's above my head.
[31:01.26]Okay, listen, listen, listen.
[31:02.34]Listen, important.
[31:02.99]We have name tags.
[31:04.03]They were chasing me around, screaming at me and shit.
[31:06.27]And they were like, hey, don't tell anybody.
[31:07.79]And I was like, I'm fucking running for my life and screaming.
[31:10.15]It's these two, or at least it's one of them.
[31:11.87]That does not sound like something I would do.
[31:13.33]One task, do one task.
[31:14.49]I went, okay.
[31:15.27]Are you alive?
[31:16.13]I went to go do a task and they both got like weirdly in a triangle pattern behind me.
[31:20.71]And I'm just sitting there going like.
[31:22.54]I'm like, why are they doing this?
[31:23.70]Why are they doing this?
[31:24.96]So it has to be these two.
[31:26.70]It's Charborg and Failboat.
[31:28.96]You're making a big mistake if you listen to him.
[31:30.92]Don't listen to a word that guy says.
[31:31.98]I'm telling you right now.
[31:32.71]I've known Charborg for years, and he's never done anything suspect whatsoever.
[31:36.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[31:37.23]I'm a nice guy.
[31:38.03]You said I was yelling at you.
[31:39.53]Is it possible that... I was being chased.
[31:45.98]and it doesn't show the imposter thing gone.
[31:48.38]That's insane.
[31:49.38]That's insane.
[31:50.22]Oh, we got five seconds of voting.
[31:52.58]I'm telling you, it's these two.
[31:54.22]This is insanity.
[31:55.78]No, don't skip.
[31:56.40]I'm telling you, they chased me around.
[31:57.54]It was weird.
[31:57.96]It was scary.
[31:58.57]Because it's funny.
[32:02.09]Well, I'm still alive.
[32:03.07]You are still alive.
[32:04.55]That's true.
[32:05.35]Yeah, that's what matters.
[32:06.57]Am I loud?
[32:07.13]I'm going to go take care of my task, guys.
[32:08.87]I think he was getting bullied.
[32:10.29]We're good.
[32:10.75]We're good.
[32:11.74]We got some work to do.
[32:12.80]I've got my eye on you.
[32:16.37]Hey, I'm cool, man.
[32:17.23]I think you might have been thinking of the other green guy.
[32:19.53]What?
[32:22.74]I didn't do anything.
[32:23.90]I've been doing my task.
[32:24.84]I haven't run into you once.
[32:27.08]I want to watch you do a task.
[32:29.68]Okay, come with me.
[32:30.50]Let me see where we got tasks.
[32:31.80]I'm going to follow right behind you, and I want you to do a task.
[32:33.88]Alright, right over this way.
[32:34.98]Come with me.
[32:41.80]I know it's you, and I'm going to convince everybody eventually, and eventually they're going to get on my side.
[32:45.98]I'm going to convince everybody eventually, but I'm staying far enough away from it.
[32:49.34]I am the imposter, and I'm going to kill you, and I'm going to kill everybody you know.
[32:53.39]Tell them.
[32:53.85]See if they believe you.
[32:55.43]Can I?
[32:55.89]Emergency meeting.
[32:57.45]Wait, there is a... I'm telling you, it's these two.
[33:01.41]I'm telling you, this is like fucking crazy.
[33:03.65]Why am I the crazy guy in the fucking horror movie that nobody believes?
[33:14.79]Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, listen.
[33:15.75]Vinny.
[33:16.47]They... Oh, boy.
[33:17.63]Fuck.
[33:37.97]It's wrong.
[33:38.97]They're just being weirdos.
[33:40.13]God damn it, man.
[33:43.09]You gotta be kidding me.
[33:56.55]Why were they chasing me around?
[33:58.37]It's because I'm a new player and oh, no, but it has to be one of them, right?
[34:02.34]They're going to vote Charborg out because I got my like weird fucking like maniacal talk.
[34:13.54]Oh, hi.
[34:16.78]I had it wrong.
[34:17.50]I had it dead wrong.
[34:20.67]I'm very curious what happens here.
[34:26.09]How's my volume?
[34:27.13]Should I turn it down?
[34:28.13]Should I turn me down and them up?
[34:33.06]Unicorn.
[34:54.47]Yeah.
[34:54.73]Am I good?
[34:55.31]Okay.
[34:55.47]Just turn them up.
[34:56.15]So who are they voting for?
[34:57.93]Oh, they're going to actually get it.
[35:11.95]I can't play these games man, I get too fucked up.
[35:15.93]Especially in VR, I get to untangle myself.
[35:18.33]That's so funny though.
[35:38.85]Yeah, he, okay, so Charborg was following me around making like goblin sounds.
[35:44.18]Like, I'm going to get you.
[35:45.80]Like, and chasing behind me and stuff.
[35:47.30]And I'm like, what the fuck?
[35:47.96]It's definitely him.
[35:49.92]But isn't that your job?
[35:53.80]Well, I'm not, I'm not.
[35:54.85]Resident Sus guy?
[35:56.33]Yeah, but I have to get the imposter first.
[36:00.49]I can't, I can't just play, you know, I can't just play the part.
[36:03.03]I have to be the part.
[36:06.39]It's kind of unfair.
[36:06.93]You're a better actor than I am.
[36:08.53]You've successfully portrayed yourself as a normal human being for years, which is a real skill.
[36:13.41]I wish I was half that good.
[36:14.63]I love how you're just like the resident ghost.
[36:19.61]How did you die?
[36:20.35]I said hello to Vinny.
[36:24.08]Oh.
[36:24.66]I actually ran away from everyone because when everybody's talking...
[36:31.37]I feel like we should have some sort of conch or something that we can pass around to everyone so everybody gets their two seconds to say something instead of everybody just screaming over one another.
[36:41.12]I guess that's what lobbies just turn into.
[36:43.42]Oh, we have to do tasks.
[36:47.91]Oh, yeah.
[36:48.75]You have to do stuff.
[36:49.83]So what does this do?
[36:51.81]Oh, you can't move.
[36:52.81]Hold on.
[36:54.41]Yeah, I think I have to click on the window.
[36:57.33]I think.
[36:58.31]Oh, yeah.
[36:59.57]Like people.
[37:00.06]Oh, hey.
[37:02.08]Okay.
[37:04.58]Wait.
[37:05.78]Alright.
[37:06.16]So what happened?
[37:08.06]Oh.
[37:08.36]Two dead?
[37:10.28]What?
[37:10.70]Oh, shit.
[37:11.52]Oh, no.
[37:12.20]It's weird when you're dead.
[37:14.18]Yeah, it's really weird.
[37:15.10]It's not just you worth a dime.
[37:17.88]So who got you?
[37:20.41]Vinny.
[37:20.91]He was in the captain's quarters.
[37:21.99]He was watching me the whole time.
[37:23.47]Then he slowly walked over and just fucking slid.
[37:25.81]He got me, too.
[37:28.55]That's so funny.
[37:29.23]So when you were being chased, was it Charmander or was it Vinny?
[37:32.37]No, it was you.
[37:33.33]Yeah, it was you.
[37:34.43]It was Charmander.
[37:35.79]Yeah, I was just chasing him and screaming at him and stuff.
[37:39.69]He was like, yeah, you and Philbo.
[37:42.10]You're like, yeah, we're the imposters.
[37:43.38]We're coming.
[37:43.70]We're going to get you.
[37:46.53]And they were hanging out together.
[37:47.52]And they had this weird triangle pattern behind me.
[37:50.75]And I was like, it was scary.
[37:52.93]I don't know what to say.
[37:54.41]I was acting on instincts.
[37:56.43]I let instincts take over, and that's what happened.
[37:58.48]I don't know what to say.
[38:00.88]I just panicked.
[38:02.32]I mean, it was funny.
[38:02.82]What you in for, man?
[38:21.47]Oh, this is funny.
[38:22.78]Okay, I get why people play this.
[38:26.28]I understand why people download this game now.
[38:28.80]What's this?
[38:30.22]They gonna get him?
[38:32.04]Nobody voted.
[38:32.86]Wow.
[38:33.50]Two still remain.
[38:48.53]Who's the other one?
[38:50.49]Alright, let me do some tasks here.
[38:55.25]Let me actually do, like, what I'm supposed to be doing.
[38:57.90]I'm just gonna do tasks.
[38:59.30]I feel like, okay, I feel like whoever the imposter is...
[39:12.58]Wants to get rid of, like, the loud guy, right?
[39:14.50]Like, just, like, let's get rid of that guy, because he's going to, like, fucking freak out and start screaming at people, right?
[39:19.22]You get rid of that guy.
[39:19.88]He's the annoying guy in the lobby.
[39:20.98]Me.
[39:22.18]Alright, how do I do this?
[39:25.92]Objective?
[39:26.42]Okay, so I got to learn how to do these.
[39:29.25]So what do I need to do?
[39:30.85]One, two, three, four.
[39:32.25]A lot of people.
[39:32.97]Oh, okay.
[39:33.17]Oh.
[39:33.35]Alright.
[39:33.59]I knew it.
[39:37.43]So it was...
[39:40.45]Oh my god.
[39:41.15]It wasn't even green or yellow.
[39:43.37]I need a drink.
[39:44.09]Where's my drink?
[39:45.25]How many subs came in?
[40:06.57]That was amazing.
[40:07.41]I'm going to stop talking from now on because he just won.
[40:14.56]It's amazing how well you can defend yourself with not saying anything.
[40:20.35]He really said, and I just was like, alright, fair.
[40:23.55]And also, this as well.
[40:24.71]Well, there's two hands for that one.
[40:26.71]Yeah, just put them in the other hand.
[40:31.61]It's in your ass.
[40:33.21]Okay.
[40:34.67]I got at least five.
[40:35.83]I got at least five.
[40:41.22]That's actually the amount.
[40:43.48]Remember, one day only, the sus guy plays Among Us.
[40:51.62]The omega sub goal out of five.
[40:54.31]I'm ready.
[40:57.05]I don't think you're in the right lobby.
[40:59.45]Oh, I didn't even take a sip.
[41:00.91]I don't want to run into anything.
[41:04.46]I appreciate it.
[41:05.00]Did Vinny just get kicked out by someone?
[41:08.08]Wait, Vinny got kicked out?
[41:09.65]Was it just a random guy?
[41:10.29]Was it just a random guy?
[41:11.35]Okay.
[41:11.89]I think someone shared that story.
[41:15.67]That's incredible.
[41:16.21]I may have done that.
[41:17.17]No, that dude came in and said, alright, who's ready to play some Among Us?
[41:19.91]And I was like, oh, this guy's... Okay, I don't know.
[41:22.39]It's possible that it was me.
[41:23.43]I didn't doubt it.
[41:24.39]Yeah, I didn't doubt it at all.
[41:25.35]That's why I'm bad at Among Us.
[41:26.60]Hold on, I gotta turn my mic down.
[41:27.98]You know, they're Among Us.
[41:29.48]Okay.
[41:29.66]I don't even know.
[41:31.14]Alright, so... Are we ready to rock and roll?
[41:35.38]Because I think there was a leak at some point, so the code is out there at some point.
[41:39.29]Are we redoing it?
[41:39.83]Can you hear me?
[41:40.39]We can hear you loud and clear.
[41:41.25]Oh my god.
[41:41.53]That was amazing.
[41:42.21]You defended yourself so well with hand gestures.
[41:44.25]Thank you.
[41:45.85]I did it somehow.
[41:46.49]Vinny, I'm never trusting you ever again.
[42:08.83]Listen, man.
[42:09.19]I'm sorry.
[42:09.41]I was hiding from two people.
[42:11.83]I know.
[42:12.41]I know.
[42:12.75]Dude, I saw Vinny alone in the cabin's quarters, and he just slowly walked towards me, and I was screaming, and no one was around.
[42:18.98]Oh.
[42:22.48]It's so scary.
[42:23.20]Alright, ready to go?
[42:25.70]I'm ready now.
[42:26.30]I don't know how to change my hair.
[42:28.34]That's okay.
[42:28.84]I'm fine.
[42:29.24]Let's do it.
[42:29.66]That's fine.
[42:30.02]That's fine.
[42:30.36]We roll.
[42:30.84]We move.
[42:31.20]We roll.
[42:31.52]I can't be doing with this.
[42:32.26]Too hot.
[42:32.46]Too hot.
[42:32.64]How you doing?
[42:33.02]Okay.
[42:33.16]No way.
[42:33.36]Oh, boy.
[42:33.58]Oh, dear.
[42:33.86]Okay.
[42:50.45]I'm gonna do my tasks.
[42:53.24]Me too.
[42:53.72]Okay.
[42:54.14]Somebody has to take care of that.
[42:55.54]They know how to play.
[42:56.16]They know how to play.
[42:56.86]I'm staying with somebody.
[42:58.16]I can stay with ten people.
[42:59.40]I'm going off.
[43:00.00]I'm going off.
[43:00.54]I'm going right.
[43:01.68]It's so dark in here.
[43:02.96]Is that where they go?
[43:03.50]I'm going to stay.
[43:04.02]Stay together.
[43:04.68]Stay together.
[43:05.66]They called the lights.
[43:06.26]They called the lights.
[43:06.94]They called the lights.
[43:08.67]You need this fail boat.
[43:09.67]You run real fast.
[43:10.83]Stay together.
[43:11.27]Why are we running so fast?
[43:12.57]Stay together.
[43:12.93]There's three of us here.
[43:13.81]One, two.
[43:15.19]Slow movements.
[43:15.99]Slow.
[43:16.45]Slow.
[43:17.29]Wait.
[43:17.49]Where am I?
[43:17.79]Just tap.
[43:18.13]Tap.
[43:18.43]Tap.
[43:18.55]Tap.
[43:20.69]That was so ominous.
[43:25.40]Hey guys.
[43:25.78]We're good, we're good.
[43:27.38]I just see green just... Hello.
[43:30.00]I'm gonna go in this corner.
[43:32.24]And I'm gonna watch.
[43:33.04]Pressing buttons.
[43:33.96]So I've got... It's good to watch your back.
[43:37.07]When you have nothing against your back.
[43:38.51]That's the strategy.
[43:41.47]So we're gonna get these tasks done, please?
[43:44.25]Yeah, yeah.
[43:44.91]I got mine done.
[43:46.20]I'm doing them.
[43:48.41]I'll watch the doorway, guys.
[43:49.89]No one's getting by me.
[43:50.87]Well, that one's not done.
[43:51.93]That might be your task.
[43:56.14]Is it mine?
[43:56.54]How does this work?
[44:00.42]Where am I?
[44:05.27]Hello?
[44:07.79]Hello?
[44:11.67]What?
[44:12.73]Hello?
[44:14.01]Can anybody hear me?
[44:18.19]What happened?
[44:21.35]Where am I?
[44:24.65]I think I got, like, sucked into the wall.
[44:26.29]Hold on.
[44:27.33]Can I... What is going on?
[44:39.11]Fix the sabotage.
[44:40.37]Okay.
[44:41.57]Um...
[44:52.14]You shouldn't have asked me to do that.
[44:54.04]Why did you ask me?
[44:55.05]You're just leading me around the entire map.
[44:57.03]How did you do that?
[44:57.87]How did you do that?
[44:59.05]I don't know.
[44:59.95]I trusted you.
[45:02.51]What happened to you?
[45:03.31]I don't want to be the imposter anymore.
[45:06.47]I went into the wall.
[45:07.49]I went into the wall.
[45:08.39]It was scary.
[45:09.26]You just walked through Hogwarts through the wall.
[45:12.28]I'm so happy, but at the same time, I don't want to be the imposter anymore.
[45:16.40]Are we going again?
[45:16.96]I have no idea what happened.
[45:18.72]I have absolutely no idea what that means.
[45:21.16]Get away from me.
[45:48.62]It's not me this time.
[45:49.70]It's not me this time.
[45:51.18]What happened?
[45:53.24]No!
[45:53.96]It's not me.
[45:54.84]I swear.
[45:55.40]Four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[45:57.88]Four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[46:00.07]Okay?
[46:00.83]It's impossible.
[46:02.59]It might be impossible.
[46:03.25]It might be impossible.
[46:04.07]It is.
[46:04.43]Please.
[46:04.77]But how funny would it be if you're voted out and it says one imposter remains?
[46:09.31]I swear to you it's not me this time.
[46:12.69]Four times in a row is statistically impossible.
[46:14.66]We need to stop goofing around, okay?
[46:17.98]No more goofing around.
[46:20.07]stop moving around I agree it's not me and I agree with any what it's been so much more around the corner of the room because it's not too much for the uh... it's been pushed over the rock if you believe that we have to be careful to talk to each other to get involved which of the skip the program if you if you do it your way it's not me how would you I swear to god it's not me again I think that hitting the emergency it's an emergency meeting you know I mean it's only for emergencies and only
[46:52.75]You're getting close If it's you again, I'm gonna be very mad I'm just telling you
[47:06.36]I just want to do my job!
[47:09.38]Are we skipping?
[47:10.79]Skip.
[47:11.55]I'm skipping.
[47:12.63]What are you doing?
[47:14.77]How do you do this?
[47:17.33]I only have one finger.
[47:19.51]Do an ET on me, bro.
[47:21.39]It's all I got.
[47:23.61]Nobody was ejected.
[47:25.11]Okay, we're fine.
[47:26.23]Okay.
[47:26.89]Okay.
[47:27.39]Okay.
[47:27.85]Now I'm going to make it.
[47:30.35]Task time.
[47:31.36]How do you do it?
[47:32.18]What tasks?
[47:32.68]How do I do tasks again?
[47:34.74]Jerma, press the button just to get the map, and go to those locations, and then just click in.
[47:39.53]I don't- I don't fucking understand what that means.
[47:42.09]Okay, so press the- what do you have, an index?
[47:45.96]Kill him!
[47:46.20]Kill him!
[47:46.66]Kill him!
[47:46.94]I can't do it!
[47:47.34]Kill him!
[47:47.60]I don't know how to do it!
[47:48.24]Kill him!
[47:48.54]Do it!
[47:48.74]Do it!
[47:48.86]I don't know how to do it!
[47:49.44]Kill him!
[47:50.08]How do you do it?
[47:50.56]Do it!
[47:50.84]Kill him!
[47:51.18]I don't know how to do it!
[47:52.20]30 seconds before you can kill!
[47:53.78]What?
[47:53.98]There's a cool down!
[47:55.22]There's a cool down!
[47:56.85]What?
[47:57.67]What?
[47:58.13]What?
[47:58.27]I heard there was a cool down.
[48:00.97]That can't be good.
[48:02.33]What the fuck?
[48:03.33]I did one task.
[48:04.65]Gather round.
[48:06.61]Gather round.
[48:07.03]Okay.
[48:07.56]Let's gather round.
[48:09.14]I'm going to tell you something, and you have to believe me.
[48:13.37]Don't believe a fucking word out of his mouth.
[48:16.73]This guy has killed me twice each time.
[48:19.77]He chased me around the cafeteria.
[48:21.98]Twice?
[48:24.10]What did you see?
[48:25.92]He chased me around the cafeteria.
[48:27.80]We were screaming in here.
[48:28.92]Did anybody hear me?
[48:31.03]No, this sounds like a lie.
[48:32.83]The last meeting was called was a little suspicious.
[48:36.70]I'm just saying, I'm saying you can, you believe me or not, but it's, it's, it's Jerma.
[48:40.46]Thank you very much.
[48:41.12]I'm here to do tasks.
[48:42.23]We're just spending all this time in meetings.
[48:43.57]What are we arguing about?
[48:44.27]What's going on?
[48:44.73]I don't know.
[48:45.17]Oh, there he goes.
[48:47.99]I've been chased around by him for literally an entire- the whole stream.
[48:51.17]Yeah, last time he got chased around, it was also a freaking juice call, okay?
[48:54.70]I see no one dead yet.
[48:56.10]I'm just telling you!
[48:57.44]Listen, I'm not gonna tell you why I think Charma did it, or is it- I'm not gonna say the reason why.
[49:03.00]You're too cool right now.
[49:03.98]Why?
[49:04.28]That seems like a thing you should say.
[49:06.44]He's literally calculated.
[49:07.63]He's cool and he's calculated, and he's trying to fucking get rid of me.
[49:11.15]You'll see later on, I guess.
[49:12.91]I mean, believe me, if you want.
[49:13.91]Dude, skip the phone.
[49:14.69]Like, what's the point?
[49:16.09]I like how people say things sometimes.
[49:18.83]I'm going back to work, alright?
[49:21.15]Yeah, let me do my task.
[49:22.45]Somebody... The spin guy's going to be right at the end of the day.
[49:26.18]The guy who says spin is going to be right.
[49:28.60]Somebody follow him.
[49:29.42]I'm afraid to be near him.
[49:30.20]Somebody follow him.
[49:31.34]Spin!
[49:31.54]Why don't you follow him?
[49:34.20]Because he's literally chasing me around the cafeteria.
[49:36.68]Spin!
[49:37.36]Alright, let me go.
[49:38.25]Spin!
[49:40.77]Are we all good?
[49:41.57]Wait, no.
[49:42.75]We're good to go?
[49:43.45]It's not, like, done.
[49:44.35]There we go.
[49:45.43]Alright.
[49:48.00]Good luck, everybody.
[49:49.02]Just don't spend too much time with Jeremiah.
[49:51.14]Alright, alright.

[51:52.59]Who was there?
[51:53.07]I saw Jerma.
[51:53.71]I saw Jerma.
[51:54.43]What?
[51:57.01]This guy killed someone.
[51:57.83]He was eating a body.
[51:58.81]We came in the room and he was eating a body.
[52:00.33]That's... Okay.
[52:01.45]Alright.
[52:01.81]Fine.
[52:02.01]What?
[52:02.31]Eating it?
[52:03.59]Look, all I know, it was dark.
[52:05.85]I was with Charborg.
[52:06.67]We were walking in the room.
[52:07.71]I saw Jerma.
[52:08.33]He went...
[52:09.71]And then, Trevor said, there's a body, there's a body.
[52:11.95]And so that's... Interesting.
[52:13.21]It was a yellow body.
[52:14.33]Interesting.
[52:14.70]Do you have anything to say to defend yourself?
[52:16.54]You two were together.
[52:17.52]That's funny.
[52:18.08]You two were walking around together.
[52:19.32]Well, yeah, we're just like... That is funny.
[52:20.96]We're just trying to, like, get... There are two imposters.
[52:24.60]Yeah, you've been following me around this whole time doing tests with me.
[52:27.92]Yeah.
[52:28.38]That's weird.
[52:29.18]So... This guy... That is kind of weird.
[52:31.60]I can't confirm.
[52:32.38]They were... Is that correct, Trevor?
[52:33.94]Just skip the vote?
[52:35.54]I'm voting for you, actually, is what I'm doing.
[52:37.66]Oh, yeah?
[52:38.12]Well, guess what?
[52:38.79]I'm going to skip.
[52:39.61]I think Jerma is suspicious.
[52:41.61]I am voting for him.
[52:43.19]How do you like that?
[52:44.57]I believe you.
[52:46.83]What do you think?
[52:47.53]Go ahead, say it.
[52:48.96]What do you think I am?
[52:51.28]I think you're an imposter.
[52:53.08]Okay.
[52:55.04]I mean, whatever.
[52:55.74]I'm voting.
[52:56.83]Saying okay is a good defense.
[52:58.41]All I'm saying is that I was chased around the cafeteria in the first five seconds of the game.
[53:03.78]People have been fucking with me the whole... Yes!
[53:11.39]I didn't know there was a cooldown to start the fucking game!
[53:14.89]I didn't know there was a cooldown!
[53:16.77]There's a cooldown!
[53:17.95]There's a cooldown!
[53:20.29]There's a goddamn cooldown!
[53:21.81]Face your sins.
[53:24.43]Face your sins.
[53:25.42]Wait, so was I just hanging with the two imposters at the bottom of the map over there?
[53:30.48]Incredible.
[53:32.25]I was hanging with them too.
[53:34.25]They stuck together.
[53:35.00]I didn't know there was a cool down.
[53:36.84]We were chasing Vinny around and I'm like trying to kill him.
[53:38.78]And I'm like, why can't I kill this guy?
[53:39.96]And then it was like, oh, there's a cool down.
[53:41.44]You can't do it.
[53:44.78]Is that why you told me to stay?
[53:46.66]Oh, I did.
[53:47.94]I should have done the tutorial.
[53:50.68]So how far is voice proximity because I was like holy shit, there's no way anybody knows I
[54:13.53]Oh, that's far.
[54:14.19]That is?
[54:14.63]Okay, but if you're behind a door... It is pretty far.
[54:16.74]Because we were running around in a circle here.
[54:17.92]Oh, yeah, if I go in here... If I go in here, then... It's like... We could even glide away.
[54:22.26]Then you can't hear me.
[54:23.38]No, no, no.
[54:23.84]I can hear him in there.
[54:24.62]I can hear him in there.
[54:25.68]Wait, what is... Well, it's because the door's open.
[54:28.02]Rambo, is that you?
[54:31.07]Yeah.
[54:31.63]What?
[54:31.87]I didn't know you were in this lobby.
[54:33.33]Oh, yeah.
[54:33.89]My username is HomeAlone.
[54:35.77]My username is HomeAlone2.
[54:36.87]Holy shit, how are you?
[54:38.35]I forget to change it on Steam.
[54:39.77]I'm doing good.
[54:40.95]I'm doing good.
[54:41.59]How are you?
[54:42.02]Oh, there it is.
[54:43.21]That's cool.
[54:43.57]I mean, you killed me, so not too good, but it's fine.
[54:47.08]It's like the other side of the station.
[54:48.24]I'm just glad it wasn't done on purpose now.
[54:50.60]Now I know.
[54:51.08]I can't believe you won with a sabotage kill.
[54:56.24]I think it's about to happen again.
[54:59.04]I'm going to be real.
[54:59.76]I think it's about to happen again.
[55:08.01]It's not fair.
[55:09.19]But it's not fair.
[55:10.47]What a lame way to lose again.
[55:12.49]I'm just saying.
[55:14.09]I didn't know there was a cooldown.
[55:16.21]That's so funny.
[55:16.93]That was a 45 second cooldown.
[55:20.20]That was a 45 second.
[55:22.96]You actually, that was a good cover though.
[55:25.02]You actually, you following, you running, yeah, that was a great cover on your part.
[55:30.70]What are your hands doing?
[55:31.84]Look at his hands.
[55:35.59]What's going on with my hands?
[55:36.85]I don't know.
[55:38.93]I'm okay.
[55:40.31]It's fine.
[55:40.75]It's okay.
[55:41.19]What happens if I throw my index controller, like, here?
[55:43.92]What happens?
[55:44.48]Is it just a floating hand?
[55:45.86]It's on the floor.
[55:46.74]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:48.48]My finger.
[55:49.38]It's like clock.
[55:49.78]Can I just walk away from my desk?
[55:52.97]Whoa, look at that.
[55:53.85]Hold on.
[55:55.92]Amazing.
[55:56.18]Do I just walk away from my hands?
[55:57.64]I wonder.
[55:58.16]Yeah, you can walk away from your hands, I think.
[55:59.62]Yeah.
[56:00.42]Oh no, it stays with you.
[56:02.62]Ew!
[56:03.08]Ew!
[56:04.10]Hey, hey there, Jolly!
[56:05.12]Get that handle going!
[56:06.96]You give me imposter again, and I'm gonna be ready this time.
[56:09.93]A little bit further in, man.
[56:11.01]A little bit in the coffee table.
[56:12.83]And just walk away.
[56:14.13]There you go.
[56:14.79]There you go.
[56:15.79]But it was a pleasure to meet you for the first time.
[56:17.67]Vinny had your back?
[56:18.63]Yeah, he did.
[56:19.35]You really know him so well.
[56:21.07]Vinny, I do appreciate the sympathy skip at the beginning.
[56:27.58]I had to call you out right away, but I'm glad that you got a chance to at least explain yourself.
[56:34.14]He just puts his hand on the table and walks away.
[56:36.82]Check this out.
[56:40.09]So funny.
[56:40.63]Listen, listen, listen.
[56:42.13]I got your back.
[56:42.81]I got your back.
[56:43.61]I appreciate it.
[56:44.97]I mean, I was chasing around screaming, how do I kill you?
[56:50.23]It's like a killer chasing you.
[56:55.29]How do I do it?
[56:55.71]How do I kill you?
[56:56.33]I don't know.
[56:56.75]Should I strangle?
[56:57.69]Should I hit you with a brick?
[56:59.37]What am I even talking about?
[57:00.39]It was amazing.
[57:01.23]It was like a Conan O'Brien bit.
[57:02.51]I loved it.
[57:03.03]He hasn't said anything in the chat.
[57:05.64]Did Connie just fucking die?
[57:07.62]There we go.
[57:08.48]Yeah, I don't see him.
[57:09.58]He hasn't said anything in the chat, so I'm not sure.
[57:12.38]He's probably trying to figure things out.
[57:13.90]That probably looks so stupid from an outside perspective.
[57:21.20]I'm just going to sit.
[57:23.44]It's kind of fun to stand and play this, but... Oh, it's really good.
[57:26.94]Connection issues on his stream, everybody.
[57:29.34]Oh, no.
[57:29.92]Oh, no.
[57:30.90]Do you want to do one and hopefully Kony will be back for the next one?
[57:33.90]Yeah, I guess so.
[57:35.70]Sure.
[57:35.94]Alright.
[57:38.50]I'm going to sip my drink.
[57:39.50]Alright.
[57:43.44]I didn't notice who else was in the room with Jerma and myself.
[57:46.94]Everyone make sure to stretch.
[57:50.72]That's some good shit.
[57:54.34]Time to go to work, everyone.
[57:55.12]Time to go to work.
[57:55.88]How are you doing?
[57:56.72]I hate being here.
[57:57.67]Yes, I was right behind you.
[58:07.87]I am going to go do my task, which is I have to go over here.
[58:12.15]I was the other imposter, and I was trying to tell him that there was a cooldown to kill.
[58:17.16]There's a 45-second cooldown.
[58:19.00]Can we all just go together?
[58:20.28]Yeah, we'll go together.
[58:22.38]No, no, no.
[58:22.92]I mean, like, everybody.
[58:23.96]We'll group up.
[58:24.90]And go back-to-back here.
[58:25.62]I don't know if everybody's going to go together.
[58:27.01]Alright.
[58:27.73]That's going to be hard to coordinate, but we can do us three.
[58:30.61]We'll try.
[58:31.07]Okay, so there's tasks this way.
[58:32.91]Yeah.
[58:35.58]Hey.
[58:36.02]What's going on over here?
[58:40.95]What the fuck you guys doing over here?
[58:43.49]I'm doing my task, I'm doing my task.
[58:45.11]I was doing a task, you were.
[58:47.91]Where is my task?
[58:48.77]Oh, it's here.
[58:49.85]Okay.
[58:51.17]Let me do this task over here.
[58:52.27]Task complete over here, guys.
[58:55.49]Thinking about it.
[59:04.58]It's really not great.
[59:05.50]Oh wait.
[59:05.80]This is the this is the thing that this is the vent you can use those right?
[59:10.13]Yes, no.
[59:11.33]I oh yes.
[59:12.27]What do you mean by yes?
[59:13.47]What did you mean by yes?
[59:14.57]You can use those you know what I mean
[59:17.91]I'm a light doer.
[59:18.91]I'm a light doer.
[59:19.41]I know you are, but what am I?
[59:21.61]Where did we go?
[59:22.11]Oops.
[59:46.41]Oh my god We weren't there we weren't there Tim Burton at his best Vinny you and I you and I were pretending to do tasks I pretended that you you would we could a joke about going through the vent and like would be funny if you got vented, right?
[60:12.93]What do you mean?
[60:15.50]Just let them mark it.
[60:16.18]It's the one that did it.
[60:17.88]It's orange.
[60:18.78]It's orange.
[60:19.54]What do you mean?
[60:20.20]I'm walking in.
[60:20.86]It was not me.
[60:22.42]Frykin, Frykin, come here.
[60:23.70]It's either that or Charlie.
[60:24.57]Tell me.
[60:24.93]Tell me what happened.
[60:30.01]There was a crossroads.
[60:31.33]I was talking to Charborg.
[60:32.77]I went in.
[60:33.09]I did a task.
[60:33.63]The lights were out.
[60:34.25]I come back out.
[60:35.12]There was a dead body, Charborg's body, and both dark blue and orange were standing over it.
[60:40.84]Orange starts sprinting towards me until someone else reported it.
[60:44.26]It was Criken.
[60:45.52]It was Criken.
[60:46.10]No, it wasn't Criken.
[60:48.69]It was Criken.
[60:49.17]No, no, no.
[60:49.63]It wasn't Criken.
[60:50.45]I think it was Criken.
[60:52.15]That sounded like a horseshit story.
[60:53.99]That sounded like a horseshit story.
[60:56.63]That was a horseshit story I think I think that was horseshit
[61:27.39]Alright, you got me convinced now.
[61:29.59]I see why everyone follows you around screaming now.
[61:31.32]I'm gonna join them.
[61:32.18]Alright.
[61:35.58]But wait a minute, what if it is Criken?
[61:36.96]I'm scared to... Penny... No, no one emergency!
[61:43.60]He went for me!
[61:45.29]He went for me!
[61:45.91]Jolly went for me!
[61:46.91]He waited until everyone else was out of the room and he went for me!
[61:49.49]Oh my god.
[61:49.97]Why are you laughing?
[61:50.58]Why are you laughing?
[61:51.26]Even if I was the person trying to kill you, I would have had a cooldown.
[61:55.04]So what would have been the point?
[61:56.42]I dodged it.
[61:57.38]I dodged it, and then I... Yep, it's Jolly.
[61:59.38]Jolly was waiting at the back of the room.
[62:00.78]He said, Crikey, in his Australian accent, and then he just starts power walking towards me.
[62:04.55]I think he was saying crikey.
[62:09.41]Oh, that's a different.
[62:10.25]I heard screams.
[62:11.55]Yeah, I heard some screams.
[62:13.39]I heard a few screams.
[62:14.36]I'm just saying I was a language barrier.
[62:16.56]Language barrier.
[62:17.12]Yeah.
[62:17.30]I can come over here.
[62:18.04]Alright.
[62:18.64]Tell me what happened.
[62:19.84]OK, so we finished voting out the last guy.
[62:21.84]Alright.
[62:22.40]I was about to leave the room.
[62:30.85]Everyone else scattered.
[62:32.42]I turn to my left.
[62:33.48]There's Pink Jolly.
[62:34.56]And he goes, cronk in.
[62:36.18]And then he starts power walking towards me, swinging his hands left and right in a kind of intimidating fashion.
[62:41.12]I run for the emergency button and smack it right before he gets around my neck.
[62:45.18]So what you're saying is he walked at you kind of funnily, and he was kind of a goofy walk.
[62:48.98]So that means it must be him.
[62:51.28]Yeah.
[62:51.56]If you've got a goofy walk, you're probably suspicious.
[62:53.94]But I do that every day.
[62:56.23]But I mean, all of us are goofy walking.
[62:57.69]You're making fun of how people walk?
[62:59.62]I do.
[62:59.92]I like do goofy walks.
[63:03.79]I don't think you're making fun of how people walk.
[63:07.03]I'm just saying that his walk had an aggressive... There was an aggressive energy to his walk.
[63:12.13]I think that you look kind of like Grimace today, so I think that it's you.
[63:16.52]No, come on!
[63:19.10]Please, I was right about the last guy.
[63:20.96]Surely I wouldn't be lying about the second guy.
[63:22.66]You gotta make the best of what you've got.
[63:24.30]What?
[63:24.64]Okay.
[63:25.25]Oh, shit, I forgot to vote for myself.
[63:30.67]Can I just please get my job done?
[63:32.17]I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[63:33.81]Oh, God.
[63:34.41]If it is you, if it's really you, I'm going to laugh.
[63:37.05]It's going to be funny.
[63:38.53]Hey, if it was me, this is the bigger brain that I have ever done in my life.
[63:42.16]Just keep an eye on Jolly, alright?
[63:43.38]Why am I still holding?
[63:44.58]Get this away from me.
[63:49.92]Oh, God damn it.
[63:50.60]I had a stupid fucking joke in my hands.
[63:53.76]Where?
[63:54.08]Oh, there's one more.
[63:55.02]There's one more.
[63:57.83]What are you doing?
[63:58.35]Oh god, there's another one?
[63:59.21]Why are there two?
[64:00.73]Oh god, we're gonna die again.
[64:01.59]Oh wait, oh thank god.
[64:04.07]Oh my god.
[64:05.25]Oh my god, we're okay.
[64:06.58]Stand across the whole room and talk to me.
[64:10.60]Stand here?
[64:11.30]Yeah, we should not be near each other.
[64:13.20]We're gonna decipher who's doing this shit.
[64:16.85]It's not me.
[64:18.11]I can tell you that much.
[64:19.09]I feel like I can trust you, because you would have probably killed me already.
[64:21.73]Yeah.
[64:22.93]I probably would have killed you by now, honestly.
[64:23.97]That's very true, very true.
[64:28.74]He just did it!
[64:30.10]He did it right in front of us!
[64:31.62]Okay!
[64:32.12]Well, I felt like it was the right moment.
[64:35.28]Here's the thing, though.
[64:36.42]He could have... That was, like, amazing.
[64:39.34]He could have faked his death.
[64:40.42]He could have faked his death.
[64:41.30]It was him.
[64:42.08]He was talking a lot of shit.
[64:43.28]He deserved it.
[64:44.88]I think he faked his death.
[64:45.79]I think he's still here.
[64:47.41]I'm voting for Criken.
[64:49.90]You know what?
[64:52.56]Yeah.
[64:52.90]We still got 10 seconds.
[64:54.16]Okay.
[64:55.18]It was not... It definitely wasn't... It was not Rambo.
[64:57.59]I'm telling you right now, we were literally in the same room.
[64:59.27]Yeah, I know.
[65:00.31]We could have killed each other easily.
[65:01.55]I think we're good.
[65:03.31]I think... Simply kill Jolly.
[65:04.85]I think it is you.
[65:05.53]Yeah.
[65:05.87]No, it is.
[65:06.53]Simply vote Jolly.
[65:08.01]Criken was telling the truth.
[65:09.04]For me, it's a bout of confidence that it's not me.
[65:11.44]Yeah, Jolly.
[65:12.22]It's Jolly.
[65:14.25]Hey the thing is, you have to remember right?
[65:31.87]So a lot of people are like, hey, what was that whole shit with Pykin?
[65:34.73]You shouldn't have done that.
[65:36.21]I got you to give a real account.
[65:38.33]You know what I mean?
[65:39.50]Oh, my God.
[65:40.12]Wow, you're right.
[65:40.62]That's so brave of you to ask me what happened.
[65:43.64]But when I questioned you, that was a real passionate, real reaction.
[65:49.05]That was a real reaction.
[65:50.47]You know my baseline.
[65:51.47]You know the baseline of what I'm like.
[65:52.53]As soon as you did that and Failboat saw it, I ran and screamed because I was like, one of us has got to survive.
[65:58.60]But instead of, it was you that killed him, but I was the one that took the bullet.
[66:03.50]You could have blamed Craig.
[66:04.54]You guys both could have been like, Craig, can you do this?
[66:06.62]You totally could have blamed Craig.
[66:07.87]But it was so clear.
[66:10.35]Like, to be fair, we were both walking together.
[66:13.48]You can always tell when somebody's kind of telling the truth.
[66:16.06]People have perfected this maybe in this game.
[66:17.74]I don't know.
[66:18.46]But the like, what?
[66:20.36]The like, what are you talking?
[66:21.82]It's like a real passionate reaction.
[66:23.66]You know what I mean?
[66:24.58]Like, I think you did it.
[66:25.38]Like, excuse me?
[66:27.49]That's how you can tell.
[66:28.15]I was just a witness to murder that no one believed.
[66:31.73]That's literally all that.
[66:32.65]Don't worry, Jolly.
[66:33.95]I'm not going to hold anything against you.
[66:35.47]That was fun.
[66:36.41]I was dead, yes.
[66:38.29]A good detective covers every base.
[66:41.27]Did Coney jump back in?
[66:42.53]No.
[66:42.89]What?
[66:43.09]I agree.
[66:43.55]Get this guy out of here.
[66:44.80]Get this guy out of here.
[66:47.26]Get this guy out of here.
[66:53.09]How do we get this guy out of here?
[66:55.29]How did he get the code?
[66:56.27]I don't know.
[66:56.69]It's been leaked at various times.
[66:58.33]Yo, he joined so we could see his name and then he left.
[67:01.77]Yeah, what do you think it meant?
[67:03.83]Ballfondler.
[67:05.14]I don't know.
[67:06.80]He's a basketball fan.
[67:07.84]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[67:08.90]Or like the movie Labyrinth where David Bowie does the thing with the balls.
[67:12.66]I want that guy banned in every chat.
[67:14.30]Every single person streaming right now.
[67:16.55]Are you talking to the vending machine?
[67:21.16]That's not a real person on there.
[67:23.34]You know that, right?
[67:24.56]You know that that's not a... That's not another guy.
[67:27.02]No, I was just... I was, like, leaning... Oh, fuck.
[67:31.51]Like, this is a person in the game?
[67:33.31]Oh, my God.
[67:34.63]Are you able to differentiate the two?
[67:37.37]PC is like breaking.
[67:37.90]It doesn't look like he's gonna be able to join yeah Nine or do we have one more?
[67:58.11]I could look for another one to build if you want, but we can also just keep going with what we got.
[68:03.44]Let's go, and then we'll see if maybe we can get someone else in here.
[68:06.64]I can't believe I got an imposter, and I fucked the whole thing up.
[68:08.68]Ross is playing with Snuffy at the moment.
[68:10.62]Oh my god, did I knock a drink over?
[68:12.24]What was that?
[68:12.95]Oh, no.
[68:13.51]Okay.
[68:14.07]Mike doesn't have VR, but alright, let's just go, and we'll figure it out as we go.
[68:17.61]Okay.
[68:18.55]Hey, if we need a tent, we can get my buddy Ballfondler.
[68:22.59]Did you know?
[68:26.65]I don't know about that one.
[68:30.31]Anybody but him.
[68:31.79]No, you don't want that guy in here.
[68:34.35]Oh, a task.
[68:34.73]Already a sabotage?
[68:35.49]Wait, which way is it?
[68:36.90]There it is.
[68:37.54]Yeah, two.
[68:37.88]Okay, okay.
[68:50.26]I can't do this.
[68:50.80]I don't know my shapes.
[68:51.48]You have to press the button.
[68:52.14]You have to press... Oh, it's the pattern.
[68:53.46]I got it.
[68:53.82]It's the pattern.
[68:54.20]Zero plus... Get out of the way!
[68:55.97]I'll do it.
[68:56.87]There, I got it.
[68:57.43]I got it.
[68:57.65]I got it.
[68:57.85]What?
[68:57.95]What do you mean?
[68:58.41]I got it. I got it. I got it.
[69:15.83]That's weird.
[69:16.17]He's a zombie.
[69:16.68]Yes That's weird.
[69:17.26]Why is his name red what?
[69:19.16]Your name is red whose name is red
[69:31.54]Wait, why is he red?
[69:32.68]I think that we should... I think we should skip the vote.
[69:36.45]I think we should skip.
[69:38.33]I think we should skip the vote.
[69:50.04]Somebody said we should skip.
[69:51.34]Can I re- Someone said we should skip.
[69:53.06]Yeah, we should skip.
[69:53.66]I did hear that.
[69:54.12]I think skip, but plus one sus to jolly.
[69:56.32]Yeah, that was weird.
[69:58.80]You've got one sus point.
[69:59.74]I swear to God, I will kill you again in a very public setting.
[70:02.72]I bet you will.
[70:06.20]Come again?
[70:06.78]One more time?
[70:08.30]Excuse me?
[70:09.48]Excuse me, what do you mean by that?
[70:11.86]Alright, I gotta take the sub goal off my stream before I fucking puke.
[70:15.06]Oh, for God's sake.
[70:16.02]What?
[70:16.24]Oh my God.
[70:18.99]Okay, wait, how do you do it?
[70:19.97]This ship is falling apart.
[70:21.18]You just match the pattern on the note.
[70:23.08]Every single person came.
[70:24.84]What the fuck is going on?
[70:31.02]Get rid of him.
[70:33.39]Get rid of him.
[70:35.57]Get rid of him.
[70:37.87]Guys, we're supposed to report dead bodies.
[70:40.17]You can't just keep reporting this guy because he's alive.
[70:43.88]We're going in an emergency meeting.
[70:45.84]Fuck this.
[70:46.74]Suckin' us all outta here.
[70:48.38]Please.
[71:04.52]I'm gonna skip the boat.
[71:05.71]Alright, we follow you.
[71:07.83]No, but there's a sabotage going on.
[71:09.01]We can't waste time.
[71:10.54]It's at the sabotage.
[71:11.40]It's at the sabotage.
[71:12.72]Jolly, you go first.
[71:14.65]Jolly goes first in front of everybody.
[71:16.81]Report your own body, Jolly.
[71:18.45]Just stay right there.
[71:19.93]Follow me.
[71:21.07]Follow me.
[71:21.83]Every single person get over here.
[71:23.81]Every single person get over here.
[71:26.23]This is Ballfondler's fault.
[71:27.87]I know it is.
[71:30.08]No, let him go first.
[71:31.06]That's not how we do it.
[71:34.06]Okay.
[71:34.94]Where's the body?
[71:35.58]Okay.
[71:36.00]Okay.
[71:36.38]Can any... Oh, my God.

[71:37.82]There's no body.
[71:38.48]Alright, guys.
[71:39.10]There's no body.
[71:40.56]Can you see the body?
[71:41.22]Somebody could kill right now and we would never know.
[71:44.71]Are you recording this yes, I am okay, so you can show us later.
[71:49.91]It's probably it's gonna be
[72:08.36]Yeah, probably.
[72:09.78]I saw my own body earlier, which was really out of body experience.
[72:14.05]Yeah, it messed me up.
[72:15.17]Fuck.
[72:16.39]I'm still recovering.
[72:18.01]Yeah, therapy.
[72:18.97]Yeah, therapy can't even heal that one.

[73:39.20]That's pretty cool.
[73:41.33]What's going on with you?
[73:43.43]I don't know, man.
[73:44.03]What's going on with you?
[73:45.31]You are in a weird spot over there.
[73:47.87]I don't know.
[73:48.23]What's weird about the spot I'm in?
[73:50.10]It's a real task.
[73:51.14]It's a real task.
[73:52.18]Why can't I speak to my friend from the corner of a wall?
[73:58.62]My tasks are complete.
[73:59.48]What about yours?
[74:00.00]I'm finishing up here.
[74:03.29]Okay.

[74:24.77]Let's kill Filbo.
[74:25.75]Let's kill Filbo.
[74:27.81]That'll fix it.
[74:29.25]I don't think I have any defense on this one.
[74:31.77]I blame Ballfondler for this whole thing.
[74:33.77]I blame Ballfondler for this.
[74:36.13]He's having premonitions.
[74:37.86]Guys, I can see the future!
[74:41.96]He's gonna be dead in admin in 30 seconds!
[74:43.66]First pink's gonna die, then red's gonna die.
[74:48.92]It's gonna be Ranboo, and then it's gonna be Char, and then it's gonna be me!
[74:54.35]See ya.
[74:55.01]Get him off the fucking ship!
[74:56.49]Get him out of here!
[74:58.13]Goodbye, premonition man!
[74:59.97]Who walked up to me at the end, because that hurts footsteps.
[75:01.83]Oh, premonition man, that sounds like a good movie title.
[75:03.51]It's time to sleep with the fishes.
[75:04.95]Except it's space, um... It's the space dirt, or whatever it is.
[75:11.45]I'll simply die.
[75:13.25]That's not what space turn is.
[75:15.90]Uh, Jerma, you gotta vote.
[75:17.56]Yeah, you just get rid of fail boat.
[75:22.02]That's fine.
[75:22.88]Alright, goodbye everybody.
[75:24.28]Hopefully I don't see any more bodies in hell.
[75:26.20]Oh, you know what would be so awesome?
[75:28.18]If we had an Among Us emergency meeting button cake for my birthday.
[75:31.22]Alright, well he's gone, so everything should be great.
[75:38.86]Okay.
[75:52.56]No, no!
[75:54.08]No!
[75:54.86]No!
[75:57.82]Stop!
[75:58.14]It's not me, I'm just fucking around.
[76:00.78]I'm trying to scare everybody.
[76:02.44]No, no, I don't like it.
[76:03.68]I'm just- I would've done it already!
[76:05.32]I would've done it already.
[76:08.37]Oh yeah?
[76:08.69]Yeah?
[76:09.21]What's stopping you now?
[76:10.03]It's pitch black.
[76:11.11]Because I'm one of your crew friends.
[76:14.93]Okay.
[76:15.77]No, I just was doing that to freak out, you know, like, you know, Vinny.
[76:18.65]You know what I mean?
[76:23.46]I am just playing.
[76:24.90]Just doing my task, guys.
[76:27.98]What did you do?
[76:29.80]What happened?
[76:30.50]I'm going.
[76:30.82]I'm doing my task, guys.
[76:31.80]I'm out of here.
[76:32.46]I'm going to do my... There's another person in this room.
[76:34.28]Okay.
[76:45.57]How do I even do this?
[76:47.71]How do I do this one?
[76:51.78]How do I do this mission?
[76:53.28]Somebody can help me do this one?
[76:55.60]What's going on?
[76:56.20]Do I have to stand still?
[77:00.04]I don't... Somebody has to help me do this one.
[77:05.68]Hey, fellas!
[77:07.70]Can somebody help me do... This is really suspicious, but can somebody help me do this?
[77:11.54]Yeah, what's up?
[77:12.33]I just don't understand how this one works, and I mean it.
[77:15.96]Okay, which one?
[77:16.76]This one over here with like the thing with the skin.
[77:20.16]You just have to not move.
[77:21.18]You have to stand completely still.
[77:22.50]I'll watch your back.
[77:23.16]Hey, don't worry.
[77:23.76]No one's coming in here.
[77:24.72]You're going to watch my back?
[77:25.81]Stay back.
[77:26.97]He's got a task to do.
[77:28.11]Vinny, you watch Kryken's back.
[77:29.09]Somebody watch Kryken's back and somebody watch Vinny.
[77:32.27]Oh, thank God, people.
[77:33.51]You've got to watch me.
[77:34.45]I got you.
[77:34.81]Okay.
[77:34.97]Jerma said that I should watch Kryken.
[77:36.73]Do you mind if I check where you came from to see if there's a body?
[77:40.35]Hey, don't come in.
[77:41.93]We got a task in here guys.
[77:43.13]You got to be chill.
[77:44.01]Okay, let's cross the little line.
[77:45.93]How does it?
[77:48.15]I think you just put your finger on it, and then you just stay still for like 15 seconds.
[77:52.38]Hey, don't cross the line.
[77:53.70]There's this Okay, okay, no entry.
[77:57.26]I'm sorry.
[77:57.72]Okay.
[77:58.00]Got it.
[77:59.02]Alright I trust you now because it could he said that he was gonna go over there to check to see if there's a body Anywhere because he doesn't trust me so yeah, well where's his where's his body now?
[78:10.29]Where's his body now?
[78:11.83]I don't know where his body is.
[78:15.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[78:16.23]I didn't make him a body.
[78:20.53]He told people to not follow him, which I thought was a reason.
[78:25.42]I mean, to be fair, where are you?
[78:28.56]Criken?
[78:28.96]Criken's still alive.
[78:30.22]He has to be.
[78:30.90]Yeah, no, Criken has to be still alive.
[78:35.58]Uh-oh.
[78:38.44]Criken, where did you go?
[78:39.82]Where did you go?
[78:40.56]There are two dead bodies.
[78:43.10]Yeah, I saw you go in there.
[78:45.46]To report them.
[78:47.33]No, no, no.
[78:47.99]You're right.
[78:48.43]I saw you report.
[78:49.61]Did you hear the escalation of the voice?
[78:51.53]The rest of us were together.
[78:53.19]Do you remember that entire show about the guy that could tell when people lied?
[78:55.99]Criken, I trusted you.
[78:57.55]Would I really walk in alone to a room and report bodies if I did the killing?
[79:01.31]What's the name of that show?
[79:02.56]That's a strategy.
[79:03.80]It is a strategy.
[79:04.42]What do you mean?
[79:05.68]No, he's like, you see what you did with your eye there?
[79:08.00]You see what you did with your eyeball there?
[79:09.60]It was an entire, they made like four or five seasons of this show.
[79:11.94]I think it's not Jerma.
[79:13.44]Lie to me.
[79:13.88]I was with Jerma.
[79:14.66]Sorry, he's talking to himself.
[79:16.30]I don't think it's you because when I walked up behind you, you genuinely were scared when there was someone else in the room, when it was Traber and you, which means I think it's most likely you and you.
[79:24.31]I think it's these two.
[79:24.93]Oh, wait, Jolly wasn't with us.
[79:26.11]No, no, no.
[79:27.13]I was with you guys.
[79:29.09]I can vouch I can vouch for like 30 minutes.
[79:31.99]It's not jolly.
[79:32.66]I can vouch I literally followed him.
[79:33.94]I was about you came from Somewhere that no one else was I traced your footsteps backwards right and then I found a body with the two dead bodies Jolly was with us almost the whole time came from the navigation panel.
[79:45.68]I didn't even go to down you were there the whole time Yeah, I never said where the bodies were I never said where the bodies were I think it's him That's where you that's where you were we saw you walk in there.
[79:55.23]Oh
[79:56.45]Yeah.
[79:57.29]That's where the bodies were.
[79:58.21]And I think you fucking left them there.
[80:01.15]How could I kill two people?
[80:03.35]You and the other guy.
[80:05.28]Oh, I don't know.
[80:07.72]I don't understand.
[80:10.32]I'm voting for.
[80:11.80]I'm sorry.
[80:12.90]I'm sorry.
[80:13.48]I don't think it's me.
[80:15.29]I mean, you were around.
[80:17.05]I'm suspicious of you.
[80:18.19]Yeah, how certain are you it's not you?
[80:23.91]Yes!
[80:25.87]Well, there you go.
[80:26.93]I'm sorry I doubted you.
[80:29.41]Thank you, thank you.
[80:30.99]Listen, I know you went off and I... You weren't moving.
[80:33.69]You could have been in the menu.
[80:34.63]You were in the menu.
[80:35.97]He was the only one not moving.
[80:36.73]He was in the menu.
[80:37.59]He was in the menu, I think.
[80:38.51]I'm still in the menu.
[80:40.01]Yeah, he's probably doing sabotages.
[80:44.35]Sabotage!
[80:45.21]I'll get the one on... Oh, shit.
[80:48.53]Oh, God, I gotta get this one.
[80:49.37]Did we get it?
[80:53.14]Don't leave me alone.
[80:54.04]Don't leave me alone.
[80:54.67]Don't leave me alone.
[80:56.93]Wait.
[80:58.17]Did you come out of that vent?
[80:59.89]No, I just fixed the sabotage.
[81:01.89]He did fix the sabotage.
[81:03.09]She did.
[81:03.45]What is wrong with you?
[81:07.09]I'm chill, guys.
[81:07.73]Sorry, I panicked.
[81:08.69]That was an amazing panic.
[81:10.19]I jumped to conclusions.
[81:11.73]Really, really nice of you to join us.
[81:13.61]Nice of you to join us.
[81:14.51]Hey, yes.
[81:16.21]Yeah, where were you, huh?
[81:17.61]How hard were you working to fix those, uh, sabotages?
[81:20.31]It is nice to join you.
[81:22.83]Yeah.
[81:24.03]Where did Vinny go?
[81:24.77]Let's, let's, we should all move together, huh?
[81:26.06]I gotta do my tasks, too.
[81:26.60]Right?
[81:26.76]Hey.
[81:26.88]You got a chance.
[81:27.30]You got a chance.
[81:27.86]Might as well take it.
[81:28.32]Might as well take it right now.
[81:29.98]You got it.
[81:30.28]Go for it.
[81:34.74]Let's see it.
[81:35.44]Come on.
[81:35.96]Do it.
[81:45.73]Do it, then.
[81:46.17]Come on!
[81:47.33]Do it!
[81:49.17]That wouldn't be right.
[81:49.99]The comedic timing is all off.
[81:51.37]See, why don't you do it?
[81:53.35]Oh, goddamn!
[81:53.77]I've told you!
[81:54.61]I knew it!
[81:58.51]Somebody find me!
[81:59.99]This is awful!
[82:07.77]The comedic timing!
[82:09.21]Oh my... Well, he did it.
[82:11.71]He did do it.
[82:12.29]I, uh, I... And, oh, they're gonna know.
[82:14.75]They're gonna know.
[82:16.47]We're about to lose!
[82:19.57]Did we get it?
[82:22.41]They got it!
[82:23.21]Oh my god, they actually got it.
[82:31.85]Where is everybody?
[82:34.25]I can't go that way.
[82:36.46]Am I just trapped here?
[82:38.76]How do I get out of here?
[82:40.95]Oh.
[82:43.49]To be me, man.
[82:44.37]I really don't want to be me.
[82:45.53]No.
[82:45.59]They got it wrong.
[82:47.09]I just taunted him.
[82:47.89]I walked up to him and I was like, I was like, why don't you fucking do it?
[82:51.73]I was like, do it already!
[82:53.11]And he did it.
[83:09.44]Oh, I got I want to listen in here.
[83:14.18]Yeah, yeah, and then he started chasing me he was Freaking me out if it's one of you dad's already an imposter who's gone to right which means it can't be one of us which means I Love this so much.
[83:28.31]I think it's jolly
[83:29.45]He's just quiet.
[83:30.59]He's not even speaking.
[83:31.75]He's not even defending himself.
[83:36.61]Look, he's got chocolate all over his face.
[83:39.52]He ate the whole cake.
[83:40.58]They're not even looking.
[83:41.38]He's got chocolate all over his face.
[83:42.66]He ate the whole cake and no one's even looking.
[83:47.63]I wish they could hear us right now.
[83:48.97]We do that with our fingers!
[83:50.55]We do that with our fingers!
[83:51.75]Hey, those fingers used to kill... He's my friend, I don't know why I actually... I'm... Good job.
[83:57.70]He ate the whole cake.
[83:58.34]We support him in the afterlife.
[83:59.78]I'm supporting him, okay?
[84:01.00]We can ask you to be a crewmate and all that stuff.
[84:04.98]No, no, no, no.
[84:05.84]I'm not going back to that lifestyle.
[84:07.38]No, no, no, no.
[84:08.72]I can't believe, if he wins this, that's going to be incredible.
[84:12.91]Yeah, it's a 3v1 right now.
[84:16.95]But to be fair, it seems more like they're just all arguing.
[84:20.17]He doesn't have to do anything, and he'll win.
[84:24.59]If he wins, I do nothing.
[84:27.02]If he wins, do anything.
[84:28.92]Oh my god.
[84:29.58]Oh my god.
[84:30.08]He's going to win!
[84:31.56]He's going to win!
[84:32.96]He's going to win!
[84:36.72]He was in the fucking menu when we were walking that time!
[84:39.26]He didn't leave the room!
[84:40.54]He just needs to kill someone, what is he doing?
[84:42.12]He just needs to kill someone!
[84:43.47]Please!
[84:44.11]Do something!
[84:44.93]Move!
[84:57.39]I got locked out.
[84:58.21]I got locked out.
[84:59.25]Oh
[85:28.24]I can't believe it.
[85:28.94]God damn it.
[85:29.58]I'm turning this off.
[85:30.24]That was funny for an hour.
[85:31.28]Why am I still dead?
[85:55.18]Why do I still have ghost sounds?
[85:56.60]I can't believe I taunted you and everything.
[85:58.42]The best part is you were sitting there the whole time.
[86:01.87]They were arguing back and forth for like 10 straight minutes and you're just going like this.
[86:25.98]You guys didn't even ask him a question.
[86:27.70]You didn't even ask him a question.
[86:37.69]Uh... I don't know, but Pissax is not one of us, so... Uh, he's one of his friends.
[86:42.71]What's his name's friend?
[86:44.15]Oh, he is.
[86:45.29]That's, uh... Let's start a new lobby.
[86:48.09]Yeah, new lobby.
[86:51.11]Does anyone know why Barstreet just hit a whip?
[86:53.57]Uh, he may have come from my neck of the woods here.
[87:00.01]Alright, new lobby.
[87:02.41]Am I... What happened?
[87:03.23]Did the game crash?
[87:07.97]The game crashed.
[87:10.75]Oh my god, it's so funny.
[87:15.09]Can I... I gotta get to the menu.
[87:18.39]Where's the menu?
[87:21.48]No menu?
[87:22.86]No access to the menu?
[87:28.02]I think I have to restart the game.
[87:29.42]Oh, no, we're good, okay.
[87:30.68]Failed to connect, alright.
[87:32.60]Alright, I'm gonna put the screen off for a sec.
[87:41.61]Because I don't want you to see the lobby code.
[87:45.05]Because I did that last time.
[87:46.05]Okay, give me one sec.
[87:50.02]How's everybody doing?
[87:52.56]Oh my god, there's like fucking 46,000 people here.
[87:54.82]I gotta play Among Us more often.
[88:04.68]Alright, let me...
[88:08.41]Please do the sus face.
[88:10.03]You got it.
[88:10.41]That's actually what it was.
[88:17.37]That was actually the face.
[88:25.59]They're making a new lobby.
[88:32.43]Lobby is currently going up.
[88:36.25]Cool.
[88:38.76]Give me one more second.
[88:44.28]Okay, looks good.
[88:46.09]Just making sure the stream looks good.
[88:50.57]Alright.
[88:52.73]Joining the lobby now.
[88:53.87]I'm going to memorize it.
[88:54.95]Is that a... Yeah.
[88:58.73]Okay.
[89:03.39]You guys can't see, right?
[89:04.37]No, okay.
[89:11.16]Is that correct?
[89:16.20]I believe that is correct.
[89:21.71]And...
[89:25.92]Hey, I think I had to leave because everybody was still in death.
[89:31.49]Like death.
[89:32.11]Oh, yeah.
[89:33.77]Yeah.
[89:34.61]Oh, what the hell?
[89:35.21]We have some weird like the colors are changed.
[89:38.41]Oh, no.
[89:38.79]Oh, my God.
[89:39.61]You're red now.
[89:40.89]You're blue now.
[89:42.53]Oh, I'm blue.
[89:44.11]You're blue.
[89:44.67]Sorry if it's loud.
[89:47.19]Twitter blue.
[89:47.99]Twitter blue.
[89:49.25]I'm blue.
[89:50.07]I'm back.
[89:50.75]I can't believe it happened.
[89:52.23]Eight dollars.
[89:52.93]Ha.
[89:54.47]Alright.
[89:55.83]Eight dollars.
[89:58.24]I'm ready to be the imposter.
[90:00.84]Hey, can you guys hear me?
[90:04.64]You have seven people in here?
[90:05.91]I can hear you.
[90:06.83]Okay, good.
[90:07.37]Thank God.
[90:07.85]I see six people.
[90:09.75]Who's the seventh?
[90:12.37]Alright, eight people.
[90:13.07]What the hell?
[90:13.59]I don't see anyone.
[90:15.57]Yeah, we're back.
[90:16.79]Oh, there we go.
[90:18.91]There we go.
[90:20.19]Oh, I'm pink now.
[90:22.75]No, that's correct.
[90:24.55]This is weird.
[90:25.81]I'm your color now.
[90:27.15]Oh, this is weird.
[90:27.75]Yeah, it is me.
[90:28.57]I've graduated.
[90:29.41]It's a bit weird you're playing with streamers you don't know too well.
[90:31.99]Guys, I don't like this.
[90:33.65]Me and Ross were playing Amogus VR in VRChat.
[90:37.39]We were absolutely playing with randos.
[90:39.81]I'll tell you what, though.
[90:41.37]I know Gascan.
[90:42.76]I know Liam.
[90:43.62]I know Zamsire.
[90:44.80]I know Failboat.
[90:45.56]I've met Failboat in person a bunch.
[90:48.12]Criken's a good friend.
[90:49.52]I know almost everyone here, like, pretty well.
[90:52.18]There's a couple, there's a couple dudes that I know.
[90:53.68]I really wish you could do finger guns.
[90:55.82]No.
[91:02.17]Alright, wait.
[91:03.37]We're missing anyone?
[91:04.45]Vinny.
[91:05.33]There we go.
[91:05.79]Yo, hi.
[91:06.53]Hello.
[91:07.19]Oh, that works.
[91:09.11]We combined the two.
[91:09.81]I'm here.
[91:10.87]Yeah.
[91:11.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[91:13.11]You got figureheads on?
[91:14.55]Yeah, you combine.
[91:16.61]We're missing Jolly.
[91:17.73]Oh, is this the TFT scout?
[91:19.43]Nice.
[91:21.12]Oh, wait, I don't want that.
[91:22.26]No, I mean, it's cool.
[91:27.74]It's cool, but I don't, I want to.
[91:29.14]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[91:30.40]It's cool.
[91:31.96]So point and thumb.
[91:34.30]Thumbs up and point.
[91:36.27]Oh, there we go.
[91:39.45]Who's moving?
[91:43.37]Don't move.
[91:44.59]I swear to God.
[91:45.81]Yeah, yeah, be careful back there.
[91:48.77]You got a gun.
[91:50.85]I don't wanna be in trouble, man.
[91:54.21]Bring out the gun.
[91:55.31]Fucking childish.
[91:56.07]Bring out the gun.
[91:57.48]Are you guys ready?
[91:59.54]Guns are not childish.
[92:00.94]I'll have you know that I'm being completely serious right now.
[92:03.66]I will shoot you.
[92:04.76]I simply will shoot you.
[92:08.41]I hope you guys are ready because I'm gonna get the imposter this time and then you're all in fucking trouble.
[92:14.62]Dan, can you hear me?
[92:16.18]I hear everyone.
[92:16.68]Make sure you can see me.
[92:24.21]Hold on, hold on.
[92:24.65]Guys, can everyone see me?
[92:26.13]Yes, I can see you.
[92:26.83]I can see you.
[92:27.51]It's just Dan.
[92:28.69]He's glitched again.
[92:30.09]Fail boat.
[92:30.51]What?
[92:30.89]Who's saying that?
[92:32.39]No, don't do this.
[92:33.58]What do you mean?
[92:34.02]Why is he?
[92:35.06]Uh-oh.
[92:35.70]Don't press it.
[92:36.58]I swear to God, don't press it.
[92:38.40]You can't see me?
[92:40.10]No, I hear nothing.
[92:40.88]Everyone get away from there.
[92:42.02]If you hit the button, you're wasting a very valuable resource.
[92:45.95]Don't.
[92:47.06]I'm gonna go do what I'm supposed to be doing.
[92:48.76]Okay, crewmates.
[92:49.40]You guys ready to do some tasks?
[92:50.62]Let's go to navigation.
[92:52.28]Stop.
[93:09.77]What was that?
[93:10.75]Guys, I swear I just heard somebody pull a blade out.
[93:13.78]No, I think I'm fine.
[93:15.28]I think I'm fine.
[93:15.66]That was weird.
[93:16.84]Okay, I'm gonna do this task.
[93:17.90]I'm alone, though.
[93:20.02]I don't like that.
[93:20.50]I gotta get done quick.
[93:23.76]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[93:24.64]Don't... I'm gonna... If somebody comes in here... Okay, how do I do this?
[93:28.50]I gotta... How does this work?
[93:32.43]What do I have to do?
[93:35.49]How does this one work?
[93:38.70]Do I have to get the pizza?
[93:39.40]How does this work?
[93:40.76]What do I do?
[93:45.38]Oh.
[93:46.12]There's no immediate issue.
[93:48.23]Hello?
[93:48.77]Hey.
[93:50.03]Hey, we never actually finished the slap game before, by the way.
[93:52.89]Yeah.
[93:53.49]You want to do it now?
[93:55.07]Yeah, let's do this.
[93:55.57]Actually, we can't see our hands.
[93:56.87]It doesn't really work.
[93:57.99]Oh, okay.
[94:01.29]I'm just getting away.
[94:02.37]I don't know.
[94:02.65]I don't trust anybody.
[94:08.36]Let's do the slap game, yeah?
[94:10.75]Let's do the slap game.
[94:12.21]AKA, he's going to do it, and then, oh, ha ha, and he's going to kill me when he does it, right?
[94:19.16]Anybody here?
[94:21.14]Oh.
[94:23.90]Okay, I'm going to go do this.
[94:38.82]Get away from me!
[94:42.08]Get away from me!
[94:42.46]Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away!
[94:56.65]Task complete over here.
[95:04.08]You've been at this task a while, Joey.
[95:06.86]I couldn't see it.
[95:08.52]Oh, they don't see that I'm fucking this up.
[95:11.35]They don't know that I'm fucking it up.
[95:12.21]Uh-oh.
[95:12.37]Okay, okay.
[95:15.31]Tasker down, Tasker down, Tasker down.
[95:25.16]I was in electrical, I walked past Vinny and Charborg, and then I heard a snap, and Charborg was dead.
[95:31.98]Who else was on the way down to storage?
[95:34.26]I don't know.
[95:34.84]I literally only saw you two.
[95:35.84]You know who was with you.
[95:36.95]It was Filbo.
[95:37.67]It was Filbo?
[95:38.25]100% Filbo was behind you.
[95:39.67]There's no ghost!
[95:40.27]Are you sure this isn't a strategy?
[95:45.49]My personal assessment is... He's over there in the fucking corner, isn't he?
[96:09.88]No, I cannot see you.
[96:10.68]I assume you're... Jolly.
[96:13.08]Well, I am, but I saw you kill someone.
[96:15.21]Come over here.
[96:16.03]What is he doing?
[96:16.61]Alright, Jolly always never says a thing during meetings.
[96:19.25]I can't see what even you did.
[96:20.51]Can we pause this?
[96:21.45]A little space, the final frontier bit.
[96:23.67]Sure.
[96:24.19]Yeah, and how's it going?
[96:25.45]Unintentional strategy from Vin just being visible to the imposter.
[96:31.32]Can't lose.
[96:31.90]That's the strategy, though.
[96:33.00]If you go look out the window while everybody argues, no one's going to point the finger at you.
[96:37.05]Hey, you're being awfully quiet again.
[96:40.69]Everybody, just hear me out one more time.
[96:42.55]Criken reported the body, but Failboat was literally right behind him.
[96:46.17]I swear, Criken, Failboat, please vote Failboat.
[96:49.02]Believe me.
[96:49.50]I can't believe you as much as I can see you.
[96:51.08]I can't believe it, man.
[96:51.70]Excuse me?
[96:52.32]That's three.
[96:52.80]That might be enough.
[97:01.80]Later.
[97:02.12]Oh, you got it.
[97:04.93]Got it.
[97:05.31]Nice job.
[97:08.09]You sure you didn't know who was behind you?
[97:10.45]No, I literally didn't see anyone else.
[97:11.83]Jolly, he was following you.
[97:13.29]He was ready to fuck you.
[97:14.17]This is following me?
[97:15.21]Incredibly important.
[97:16.11]Jolly just went by himself that way and didn't say a goddamn word.
[97:18.91]He literally walked through.
[97:19.77]He didn't even say goodbye.
[97:21.17]Didn't even say goodbye.
[97:22.31]And what do you know?
[97:23.35]Oh, what do you know?
[97:25.05]This is sabotage.
[97:26.25]Who the hell, I wonder?
[97:27.93]Let's call the meeting here.
[97:29.63]Yeah.
[97:30.19]No, we have to hit the- How do I have to get the sabotage first?
[97:36.16]Oh, shit!
[97:36.68]Oh, fuck!
[97:37.06]Yeah, he- he took off.
[97:41.04]I don't know- I don't know how- I don't know what this- I don't know what this means.
[97:50.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[97:51.91]I just- If I die, just let me know.
[97:53.93]I'm telling you, Jolly walked away by himself.
[97:57.17]Okay, so, alright, I'll keep an eye out.
[97:59.49]I'm not the imposter.
[98:01.16]Jerma, do me a favor.
[98:02.18]Um, when you go to this, can you click it?
[98:05.22]Yeah.
[98:08.38]Oh my god!
[98:11.94]Criken.
[98:14.40]Oh my god.
[98:14.96]Here's my counter-argument to you all.
[98:16.98]You!
[98:17.21]What is it?
[98:17.45]I was in a room with Criken and Zam.
[98:20.23]Would I not have killed you immediately for a fucking laugh?
[98:24.69]No, because then Zam would have reported you.
[98:27.52]Explain to us all Explain to us all in this room right now why you left first and you didn't say it gosh darn word.
[98:32.74]Oh
[98:52.08]Bro, my hands are so big.
[98:53.40]How come you left?
[98:54.08]How come you left first?
[98:55.07]It's kind of a sensory overload.
[98:56.93]Yeah, I was gonna say.
[98:58.89]Actually a good answer.
[98:59.93]Fuck.
[99:02.81]Actually a good answer.
[99:03.67]God damn it.
[99:04.21]Look, we were, we were, as soon as Jolly left, there was a sabotage.
[99:08.72]We all went to go fix it.
[99:10.08]Jolly, as we were leaving to hit this button, locks the door, and both of us were stuck inside with him.
[99:18.00]To be fair, you can lock the door from the map, so the imposter could have been anywhere to do that.
[99:23.17]Oh, you can lock the door from the map.
[99:24.91]Convenient timing.
[99:25.87]I don't know.
[99:26.21]Yeah, but also when you walked off and then sabotage happened, I don't know.
[99:30.69]It also could have been somebody just standing in the group, you know?
[99:33.71]I also think it's Jolly.
[99:35.49]I have no idea.
[99:36.01]Let's vote Jolly, because I don't think it's Jolly.
[99:38.55]We've got people to burn.
[99:39.85]It's okay.
[99:40.33]Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[99:41.59]Yeah.
[99:42.33]Well, I guess my... Craig, and I just gotta pay you back from before, sorry.
[99:46.83]Huh?
[99:47.87]Just in case.
[99:48.43]He voted on me!
[99:51.17]Just in case, I don't know.
[99:52.25]Oh, I'm sorry.
[99:56.47]It's Criken.
[99:57.39]Okay, I'm just gonna run this way.
[99:59.97]Why, bro?
[100:00.33]Because I voted on you that one time, everyone.
[100:03.35]Bro, new life rule, okay?
[100:05.19]You were with Failboat, and you reported the body as a strat because you saw me walk in the room.
[100:12.44]It is you who is the imposter.
[100:15.85]Wait, hold on now.
[100:17.21]We can't just jump to a conclusion here.
[100:19.63]We haven't even said anything.
[100:21.69]I'm going to say, Criken, it's been nice knowing you, buddy.
[100:27.37]What have I done?
[100:28.51]I reported the first body and I think we're sussing him out right now.
[100:34.47]Maybe you should practice this move.
[100:36.07]Practice this one.
[100:41.37]And then you voted Jolly.
[100:42.97]Listen, if it was between you and Jolly, and Jolly was not the imposter, then it is you who the imposter is.
[100:46.58]So I'm voting for you as soon as I can.
[100:48.70]In five seconds, four, three, two, one.
[100:51.28]I do not have a single thing to say to you anymore, friend.
[100:53.88]Vinny could have killed me, and we were in a room alone together, and he could have killed me.
[100:58.50]It was literally like a straight minute.
[101:00.96]As soon as I saw it and then you report another you are doing 4d chess, bro I'm just playing a good fucking crew man.
[101:05.77]Alright
[101:19.40]What?
[101:19.86]Don't give me a thumbs down.
[101:21.06]Oh, damn.
[101:24.38]I gotta make a decision here.
[101:25.73]Vinny's playing the long game here, and he's fucking calling people out and getting them out one at a time.
[101:30.25]You're deflecting.
[101:31.91]He could have killed me so many times.
[101:32.95]I deflected because my life's on the line, and you're fucking, you're suddenly throwing me under the bus.
[101:36.01]Vinny could have sold out Failboat to gain time.
[101:37.91]There is, there is some, your voice is doing a thing there.
[101:42.38]It's the same thing that I did when I was telling you the story about what happened when I was fucking being chased around.
[101:47.04]It's not me.
[101:48.02]I- I- I'm sorry.
[101:49.74]I'm sorry, but- I'm sorry, Criken.
[101:51.30]No!
[101:51.72]If it's not you, then... It's okay, man.
[101:53.22]We'll see you next time.
[101:54.36]Your eye twitched.
[101:55.74]Your eye twitched.
[101:57.70]Gotta go.
[101:59.02]Oh, okay.
[101:59.44]Woo!
[102:00.50]Alright.
[102:00.92]Criken, if our friendship has been irreparably damaged, I'd like to apologize.
[102:05.10]One more new lobby if I can't see Vinny.
[102:06.48]Body language.
[102:09.04]Alright, where's Vinny?
[102:10.00]We both get one.
[102:10.90]Alright, Vinny?
[102:12.68]Okay.
[102:13.06]Okay.
[102:13.74]I still cannot see Vinny.
[102:16.20]Hold on.
[102:16.44]I'm going to try and re-log.
[102:18.04]Let me try and re-log here.
[102:19.42]Oh, look at all these imposters.
[102:23.70]The game is tearing you all apart.
[102:30.50]This is for one day only, by the way.
[102:33.02]This shit ain't ever coming back.
[102:36.10]I wish I could rescind it.
[102:40.79]in your lobby are we going with this one now we're sticking with this one that's so sus dude BatChest there you are yeah and pony are you back a little bit slurry today it's going to be bad like that way I think he's still streaming it says he's still streaming I'm really close to the camera it's
[103:02.58]Vinny, please rerecord the Davies Gray songs with Redbox and make them better.
[103:05.85]You know what?
[103:06.31]What I should have done was just beeline it for Vinny instead of reporting the body that first time.
[103:11.17]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:12.79]Dude, that is the most backhanded request ever.
[103:14.81]Him being an actual TF2 spy.
[103:19.47]Like, I was just like, oh, I'm going to kill someone.
[103:21.39]Then Vinny's like, I've seen it.
[103:22.19]Do the imposter dance?
[103:24.02]I feel like it's you point your fingers or something.
[103:26.16]It's kind of like a something like this.
[103:29.76]I don't know.
[103:31.36]Probably.
[103:35.39]You guys having a good time?
[103:36.29]I know I'm not really checking in that often, but how you guys doing?
[103:38.21]You guys having fun?
[103:40.57]You guys enjoying yourselves?
[103:43.55]Well, enjoy it, because shit's getting fucking torn down tomorrow.
[103:49.60]I was just making my stream entertaining by watching yours.
[103:54.08]Hey, what?
[103:54.78]You're an entertaining guy.
[103:55.74]What are you talking about?
[103:56.62]I'm actually putting in the effort.
[103:58.55]I mean, I'm entertaining, but I'm also lazy.
[104:03.22]That was a weird sound that came out of my mouth.
[104:04.91]I'm sorry.
[104:06.09]Everyone probably heard it.
[104:06.91]I don't have a noise gate on today.
[104:12.11]How we looking?
[104:13.19]Oh my god.
[104:14.05]That's rude.
[104:15.23]Hands.
[104:16.25]Who are we missing right now?
[104:18.35]Oh, yeah.
[104:18.63]Who are we missing here?
[104:19.25]You didn't hear that.
[104:20.37]Can we harmonize?
[104:21.09]Yeah.
[104:21.31]Do you know the Beatles?
[104:30.45]um no but okay so okay are you can you do low or can you do high I can do low I have covid so I probably can't do highs but I can probably do like what would you call this what's that that's like I'd call that a bad song no that's baritone but it's uh oh no I'm just saying oh that's like that's pretty beautiful
[104:54.60]Can we harmonize?
[104:55.94]Can you guys do the dumb thing that I wanted to do?
[104:58.95]Tenor.
[104:59.27]Your tenor.
[104:59.77]Oh, that is what it is.
[105:00.63]How low?
[105:00.99]No, I'm thinking more kind of like... I've got a quest, too.
[105:03.63]Go ahead.
[105:05.11]That's beautiful.
[105:05.79]That's called music.
[105:06.49]Can you go that low?
[105:25.95]Ow!
[105:26.89]Ow!
[105:27.43]My fucking body hurts now.
[105:29.71]That's harmonizing.
[105:30.49]That's harmonizing.
[105:31.11]That's what they call music.
[105:32.43]That's what it sounds like in, like, the summertime out in, like, the woods.
[105:37.62]It's just like fucking frogs.
[105:38.60]Look at how woods you go to.
[105:39.84]Frogs and bugs.
[105:43.88]Frogs do that.
[105:44.68]The frogs when they throat sing, you know.
[105:48.13]Have you ever listened outside or at, like, in the summertime in a swampy environment?
[105:53.68]I'll go out to interview a frog just for you here.
[105:56.60]What kind of task are you doing right now?
[105:58.68]Um, I'm going... What's your end goal?
[106:00.54]My goal is to go to Reactor.
[106:03.16]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[106:05.66]I'm going to our side of the map.
[106:07.68]Okay, you got that one.
[106:08.77]If I'm going to spend time working on music, I'd have to be really interested.
[106:16.89]Vinny, did you do that?
[106:18.17]Sick.
[106:27.43]I don't fucking understand what's going on.
[106:34.39]What the fuck?
[106:54.78]Oops.
[107:02.27]The fuck is wrong with me?
[107:04.83]Oh, shit.
[107:08.93]Oh, shit.
[107:29.38]Okay, there's somebody with you, alright.
[107:45.80]I am currently with Charborg and I just saw Jolly go down through admin.
[107:51.32]What's your task?
[107:56.46]I have to go in here and flip this lever.
[107:58.08]You do.
[107:58.88]Interesting.
[107:59.28]Go ahead and do it.
[108:06.81]Thanks.
[108:07.53]You're welcome.
[108:09.57]Why are you so jumpy?
[108:10.05]I don't know, because we're alone together, and I don't know you.
[108:14.20]I don't know you, man.
[108:15.48]I don't know you.
[108:16.14]I don't know you.
[108:16.84]I'm chill.
[108:17.50]I don't know you.
[108:18.22]Alright, stay away.
[108:19.84]Stay at least five, seven feet away from me.
[108:23.24]God dammit, I knew it!
[108:30.92]Fuck!
[108:34.68]I knew it too!
[108:35.86]I knew it.
[108:36.40]Wow.
[108:38.12]No, that was good.
[108:43.18]That was good.
[108:44.98]Why?
[108:47.02]Bro, it was just a win button.
[108:49.26]I hate it.
[108:49.69]What?
[108:50.01]Is there a way to extend the time?
[108:52.63]Hey, am I, like, wicked loud when I scream?
[108:55.10]I hope not.
[108:55.96]Because, like, I didn't do, like, a noise gate today.
[108:58.36]I hope I'm not, like, screaming in your ears.
[109:01.24]Okay, good.
[109:04.87]Sorry.
[109:05.23]Oh, I knew it was Charborg, too.
[109:07.37]I was going to call the meeting next time we had the chance.
[109:09.94]Yeah, I just lied.
[109:12.46]It's scary.
[109:13.18]It's so funny.
[109:14.18]Because you were like, oh, I'm just doing my task.
[109:16.10]And there's nothing to do in that room.
[109:17.36]And I was like, wait, didn't that?
[109:18.90]I don't get it.
[109:19.74]And he looked at the screen for like one second and turned around and he followed me.
[109:22.48]I pretended to do it.
[109:23.30]I pushed a couple of imaginary buttons.
[109:26.30]I was like, that's like, is that even accurate?
[109:28.30]Four out of five.
[109:30.80]I was hitting the buttons.
[109:32.08]I hit four out of five buttons.
[109:33.53]It was zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[109:35.35]I hit zero, zero, zero, zero.
[109:39.51]I cost us the game.
[109:40.55]How long have we been playing for?
[109:41.51]I feel like time flies when you're the imposter.
[109:44.15]I don't think it's been that long.
[109:45.47]An hour and fifty.
[109:46.61]Cool.
[109:48.01]It's not too much.
[109:50.29]We're still missing some people, too.
[109:52.41]It's eight out of ten.
[109:53.60]We're missing Zam and... Are we missing people?
[110:02.16]Yeah, Zam's headset died and obviously Kony.
[110:05.92]Chat, what was I?
[110:11.51]What?
[110:12.41]Why does that keep happening?
[110:13.27]Because an imposter is making it happen.
[110:19.96]Oh.
[110:21.12]We got to fix it, otherwise we die.
[110:23.06]Oh, okay.
[110:24.40]That's the instant win button, basically, for the imposter.
[110:27.50]Instant win.
[110:28.40]So if that ghost is... What do you mean?
[110:30.01]Well, if you don't fix those things like we didn't before, they just win.
[110:34.69]You're not going to kill me, right?
[110:35.61]No, I'm looking for another person, so we're not alone together.
[110:38.83]Okay.
[110:39.01]Alright.
[110:43.00]Jesus.
[110:43.36]Alright, are you- are you doing your tasks, Jerma?
[110:46.05]Uh, I don't know what- uh, by the way, get- get outta here, got- you imposter just fucking got you, sus guy got you, motherfucker.
[110:51.87]...to the place, to the do, to the do the thing, then don't- Ask?
[110:55.92]Well, no, okay, I guess I won't do it.
[110:57.58]Okay.
[110:58.86]Who died?
[110:59.22]Hello!
[111:00.40]I mean, that was Vinny, right?
[111:02.42]Hmm.
[111:02.82]Oh, what?
[111:03.08]I saw.
[111:03.58]I saw.
[111:04.30]Interesting.
[111:07.60]I turned the corner, I was standing in the hallway, I saw Jerma go like this.
[111:10.55]I'm gonna do a representation, a reenactment.
[111:12.95]A reenactment?
[111:15.51]And he killed someone.
[111:17.51]And he sprinted in the opposite direction.
[111:21.18]I did see him run away from the body.
[111:23.78]Fucking porky pig.
[111:25.60]I was there.
[111:27.48]You did run away from the body, I saw it.
[111:29.46]You ran right into me.
[111:30.39]I didn't see a body.
[111:32.51]In what room?
[111:37.09]I have insane tunnel vision right now.
[111:38.77]I don't know how to play the game.
[111:39.73]Oh, he doesn't know how to play the game.
[111:41.81]It's been an hour and a half.
[111:44.26]I just had to ask Vinny.
[111:46.30]I just had to ask Vinny before his untimely death.
[111:56.44]You can't get rid of me.
[111:57.59]You can't get rid of me.
[111:58.35]I'm holding on.
[111:59.39]You can't get rid of me.
[112:00.47]I'm holding on.
[112:01.47]You can't get rid of me.
[112:04.41]I'm not going.
[112:05.37]I'm not fucking going.
[112:06.03]He says he doesn't even see a body.
[112:07.41]He doesn't even see him assuming.
[112:08.33]I ain't going.
[112:08.75]I'm not letting go.
[112:09.31]You're going to have to fucking kill me yourselves.
[112:11.57]Get him out of here.
[112:12.45]I'm not letting go.
[112:13.09]Hey, guys.
[112:17.29]That sounds funny.
[112:17.99]Okay, so let's skip the vote.
[112:18.93]Who knows who it was?
[112:19.77]We don't have any idea.
[112:20.77]Look at anybody.
[112:23.62]I think we should skip.
[112:26.21]Fuck this cake!
[112:27.87]I don't even want it anymore!
[112:29.99]My fucking fifth birthday party was ruined!
[112:34.77]Hey, how are you?
[112:39.83]No, I'm not good at this.
[112:41.22]Did I do good?
[112:53.24]You did great, champ.
[112:54.82]Good on ya.
[112:55.40]You did great at the ball game today.
[113:00.25]I did hit the ball.
[113:01.77]I hit a dribbler back to the pitcher, and I forgot to run to first base.
[113:07.25]Yeah.
[113:08.47]Oh, we have task, right?
[113:10.35]Oh, fuck.
[113:10.99]I can't move.
[113:12.97]Oh, I was talking to Vinny.
[113:14.15]Like, what an idiot.
[113:17.09]I can't do... Oh, when I was talking to Vinny, you know, right before he died...
[113:22.19]I deserve that.
[113:23.21]I swear to God, I swear to God.
[113:25.12]Dude, did you hear my explanation of what happened?
[113:27.68]Uh, no, but what I did hear was you, as you were stabbing me, you were saying really bizarre, like, demented, like, serial killer shit.
[113:35.34]So that was cool.
[113:37.88]Um, what was your explanation, Sharma?
[113:40.38]They asked, I mentioned how I had just talked to you.
[113:42.98]I was like, oh, when I just talked to him, and they were like, what do you mean just talked to him?
[113:46.46]Like, you were in the room with him.
[113:49.06]I was the only one in the room with you.
[113:51.33]That's like when I said I walked past your corpse when I first started playing the game today.
[113:55.71]It's not a good strat.
[113:56.83]Oh, he got him.
[114:01.23]Hey, welcome to the club, man.
[114:04.66]Yeah, I got killed.
[114:06.22]I tried my best.
[114:09.58]You know, I tried my best to defend myself by screaming as loud as I could, but it didn't work out in the end.
[114:14.80]Oh, man, this is funny.
[114:16.40]Sorry to hear that.
[114:18.88]I will say your meat bone is particularly strong.
[114:22.08]Look at this thing.
[114:23.48]Oh, my God.
[114:23.98]Wait, I can see myself.
[114:25.22]Wait, I'm going to put myself back together.
[114:26.52]Are you kidding me?
[114:28.32]This is a marketing scheme here.
[114:29.60]How have they not done this?
[114:31.12]Popsicle with the bone.
[114:32.70]The bone's the stick, and it's an Among Us character.
[114:36.62]Right?
[114:37.98]I would not want anybody... I wouldn't want to see people eating that.
[114:40.69]That would gross me out.
[114:41.99]Yo, like at the Boardwalk in New Jersey, they sell bootleg Amoguses.
[114:46.89]Like, it's real Amogus, but it's bootleg companies that probably don't have the rights to sell them.
[114:52.81]Jermo, we could sell the popsicles.
[114:55.81]Could we?
[114:57.81]I don't think we can.
[114:59.71]It's just a shape.
[115:01.39]It would just be green with a bone.
[115:03.67]You should actually get like a big ham leg with a bone sticking out and just carve it to look like an Among Us.
[115:11.54]That way it's a little more immersive.
[115:13.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[115:14.72]Does that save us?
[115:15.42]Yes, that saves us.
[115:16.16]That saves us.
[115:16.66]Oh.
[115:26.71]Do they have any idea?
[115:27.47]Yeah sure, okay buddy.
[115:28.01]The impression that you did earlier about- oh that was so goddamn funny.
[115:51.29]Which one, Jerm?
[116:00.00]He walked by my like this: ???
[116:02.46]Right.
[116:05.54]That was perfect. That could've been me talking.
[116:14.54]Is that Jerma says a chat member. No that's the sus guy.
[116:17.85]Yeah, a different person today.
[116:18.87]Boo!
[116:18.95]Boo!
[116:19.11]Hey!
[116:19.19]Are they gonna vote?
[116:19.69]Who are they voting for?
[116:47.93]Aiyo!
[116:49.76]No, they're not gonna get it.
[116:50.90]I can't believe it.
[116:51.38]Where was the body?
[116:51.82]I can't believe this.
[116:52.70]I did that, that's funny.
[116:53.66]I just pressed that.
[116:54.60]I did that, it was me.
[117:25.77]Finally.
[117:26.33]Oh.
[117:30.73]The official sussicle.
[117:34.13]Oh, this person's dead.
[117:40.27]So, if...
[117:51.08]If somebody dies here, can they see who even does it?
[117:53.38]Or could it be anybody in this, you know, five feet of each other?
[117:57.26]If he kills right now, would it be, like, somebody in the room, or would they see it?
[117:59.98]They can't see.
[118:00.58]Oh, they can.
[118:01.10]They can.
[118:01.40]They can.
[118:01.74]Tick-tock.
[118:02.10]Here comes the reactor.
[118:25.47]Oh, he's- yep.
[118:27.09]Yep, he knows it.
[118:28.79]He knows it.
[118:29.29]Oh, that's tricky.
[118:31.99]He's a- he's a tricky motherfucker, he really is.
[118:34.02]Yep.
[118:34.14]Yep.
[118:51.54]Oh, no.
[118:51.94]Yeah, this is bad.
[118:53.23]This is gonna end it.
[118:54.43]Oh.
[118:54.57]No, no, no.
[118:55.07]Don't do it.
[118:56.33]Don't do it.
[118:57.31]Don't do it.
[118:57.59]Okay.
[119:14.36]I'm just pressing buttons, man.
[119:18.02]I don't know.
[119:18.38]Sticking around back here, though.
[119:19.42]Ooh, if you catch up, you can get that kill right there and turn around and run.
[119:39.47]What's the strategy here by the way my streams, it's pretty awesome Okay, in that case I'll do my test
[120:09.47]Okay, now they're splitting up.
[120:12.69]Oh, this is it right here.
[120:13.71]This is it right here.
[120:15.41]He can do it right now.
[120:16.01]Oh, he's playing the long con.
[120:17.42]I think he's doing the long con.
[120:18.94]He's doing the vote.
[120:19.80]He's trying to vote her.
[120:20.62]Oh.
[120:33.89]Oh, it's diabolical.
[120:34.97]Wait, did you shut that down?
[120:36.61]Did I?
[120:37.43]No, I don't think so.
[120:40.00]Can I do that?
[120:42.40]I think you do it through the map.
[120:43.78]Oh, I can do that?
[120:45.08]Jolly, I will tell you, your audio is a little bit low.
[120:47.72]You're very soft-spoken, and I think maybe if you had a little bit more volume, I would have heard you.
[120:58.08]This is the end here.
[120:59.82]This is the end right here.
[121:00.72]Why is that door open?
[121:27.29]No, God.
[121:27.73]I think it's because we came through.
[121:29.29]Is it open when we go through?
[121:30.49]Where did he go?
[121:31.19]He's right there.
[121:31.67]Oh, boy.
[121:31.91]Oh, boy.
[121:32.19]Oh, that's it.
[121:32.91]Emergency meeting.
[121:33.55]That's game.
[121:34.13]That's game.
[121:34.43]Yeah, it has a bit...
[121:57.04]I was like just kill me so that way it could be interesting I love how you put yourself in such an impossible to find spot and then they both just walked in I don't know where the body is
[122:13.58]He's actually very good.
[122:15.64]He's very good.
[122:16.00]He's very, he's methodical.
[122:16.88]He's very methodical.
[122:25.25]He is, and he's also unassuming.
[122:31.95]Just drinking our beers, looking at them play.
[122:34.27]Do I look like I know what a JPEG is?
[122:38.72]I think Liam may have done it.
[122:41.90]I think Liam may have done it.
[122:43.22]I'm not sure.
[122:47.50]That was the most stressed I've ever been in my entire life.
[122:50.52]That was really close.
[123:12.85]There we go.
[123:13.33]I chose the wrong person to kill.
[123:14.86]I definitely chose the wrong person to kill.
[123:17.98]But then again, you two were together the whole time.
[123:20.06]It was impossible for me to get rid of anybody else.
[123:21.98]I was like, I'm just going to break away from the group.
[123:23.82]You left for just long enough to see if it could have been you.
[123:26.20]Yeah, oh god, no.
[123:28.77]I should have went for you as soon as I had the chance.
[123:30.99]That was such a good game.
[123:34.15]That was actually a good game.
[123:35.19]Thank you for the sabotages.
[123:36.35]That was really helpful.
[123:37.91]I was pressing buttons.
[123:38.79]I was pressing buttons for you.
[123:39.81]You were, yeah.
[123:41.48]Let me just check and see if anyone's rejoining.
[123:43.20]Oh, boy.
[123:43.60]Yeah.
[123:43.70]Oh, we got someone back.
[123:47.64]I have a portable charger hooked up to my headset now.
[123:51.11]Oh, hell yeah.
[123:52.55]Welcome back.
[123:52.99]What headset are you in?
[123:54.25]You played a great game, Liam.
[123:55.27]That was, like, fantastically good.
[123:56.97]You kept us guessing until the very last second.
[123:58.59]That was great.
[123:59.39]Yeah, I was like, okay, if we're all moving together as a four-person unit, it's not fun.
[124:04.01]I wanted to step away and be like, alright, if you kill me, it's gonna get real funny real fast.
[124:11.08]No, you were there, you were together, and then the button was called.
[124:16.34]It was like, if he's there, it's definitely you.
[124:18.56]It was like, ah!
[124:19.06]It was so funny.
[124:20.08]I saw both of you guys avert the milk.
[124:23.28]That just tasted like a rubber tire.
[124:25.51]That was weird.
[124:31.36]Some great high quality Among Us games happening.
[124:37.08]Are we doing another one?
[124:39.28]Are we all done?
[124:39.80]Yeah, I want to do a couple more.
[124:42.12]How do you turn that option off, chat member?
[124:43.80]This game is really good.
[124:44.84]I actually prefer playing this game.
[124:48.78]I'm down to play more.
[124:49.90]My chat said something like if you could turn the option off so that dead people don't know who the imposter is
[124:57.49]Like, you have no idea how to edit that.
[125:00.19]It's in the lobby tools, I guess.
[125:02.95]Lobby options.
[125:05.19]Probably under match, whoever's hosting.
[125:07.24]Who's in here?
[125:07.80]Look at this wonderful star field.
[125:10.78]There's a big dipper.
[125:11.98]Oh, okay.
[125:12.42]Wait, there actually is a constellation over here.
[125:14.36]What is that?
[125:15.19]All is there?
[125:15.77]Look at that.
[125:16.43]You have to be lobby leader.
[125:18.61]Alright, never mind.
[125:19.59]Oh, there is!
[125:20.53]It's one for real.
[125:21.29]Hey, hey, hey.
[125:21.55]I think that might be the red imposter.
[125:23.15]You know what I'm saying?
[125:24.21]That might be the red imposter.
[125:26.25]I didn't ask him.
[125:27.49]Someone in my chat said, I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.
[125:32.92]What is it?
[125:34.52]Someone in my chat just said, I'm surprised he's not playing with Jerma.
[125:38.56]That is surprising.
[125:39.16]Who's this guy?
[125:39.68]He's not feeling that well.
[125:40.74]Oh, I thought...
[125:45.23]Yeah, he's not feeling good, chat member.
[125:46.73]He's a little under the weather.
[125:48.17]Alright, guys, I think there's an impostor on my right.
[126:00.16]I'm just gonna go this way.
[126:08.35]You... that was weird.
[126:09.79]You creeped up on me and I'm about to fucking do an emergency meeting.
[126:13.83]I'm about to do an emergency meeting, I'm telling you right now.
[126:16.33]You step any closer, I'm going to press it.
[126:19.90]You step any closer, I'm going to press this button.
[126:22.50]I'm just being honest.
[126:24.38]God damn it!
[126:25.26]Did I get it?
[126:27.20]Did I get it?
[126:27.62]Did I press it?
[126:28.12]Did I get it?
[126:28.50]Did I get it?
[126:30.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[126:31.42]Don't let him talk first because he's going to sound much smarter than me and it's going to fuck everything up.
[126:36.05]No, no, no.
[126:37.33]Seriously.
[126:38.69]You were in the room with me.
[126:40.37]Hold on a minute.
[126:40.97]Jolly, what were you doing?
[126:41.91]Why didn't you leave?
[126:43.96]You were in the room, and you were in the room.
[126:45.66]I need everyone to listen, please.
[126:48.08]You were in the room, and you were in the room.
[126:49.76]And I walked this way, and there was... I turned around, Crike and Jump scared me.

[129:39.13]Why did he do that to me?
[129:41.43]Why did he do that?
[129:43.33]You weren't there.

[131:50.03]Okay, sounds good.
[131:51.01]Orange is at, I could kill you right now.
[131:52.99]I could do it right now.

[131:55.25]I don't know which one's next and the Simon says.
[131:57.51]Oh, just focus.
[131:59.27]Wait, this one.
[132:00.62]Nope, I got it wrong.
[132:01.90]Okay, it was down.
[132:04.14]Okay.
[132:05.24]Fuck, it's just a children's can do this.
[132:07.88]Clutch up.
[132:09.28]Are you kidding me?
[132:10.45]What the fuck?
[132:11.91]My controller died and someone killed this man behind me while I was fixing it.
[132:17.01]I'm telling you right now, it's our... Well, Sam was the only one I thought was a little suspicious, so I got nothing.
[132:22.34]It can't be him.
[132:24.70]It can't be me.
[132:25.60]No.
[132:26.14]Did no one else hear you screaming about my controller being dead?
[132:29.26]I did not.
[132:29.84]I did not.
[132:30.30]I did.
[132:32.12]But you were, Liam, you were trailing behind us.
[132:35.09]Hold on.
[132:35.99]Yeah, because we needed to fix the sabotage.
[132:38.15]I know, but you did this.
[132:38.81]This is what you did.
[132:39.27]Everyone look.
[132:39.69]This is what he did.
[132:40.61]He went like this.

[134:13.11]A pretty good way of running that.
[134:15.01]I guess.
[134:15.37]That's a good way to go.
[134:16.69]No, this is fun.
[134:17.61]We're good.
[134:18.11]I'm tangled.
[134:29.37]He's the genuine sus guy.
[134:31.61]You managed to make it reality.
[134:34.97]Oh, no.
[134:36.73]Well, no, I mean, hey, when you walk like this.
[134:42.16]That was so funny.
[134:44.44]I love the fingers.
[134:45.84]I know, I know.
[134:47.36]It was just completely sus.
[134:52.17]I'm down to play more if you are.
[134:53.45]Wait, were you good?
[134:54.61]Oh, you have a hand sticking out of your sussy belly.
[134:59.75]I wish I never said that.
[135:02.51]I wish you didn't either.
[135:03.99]I'll do a couple more.
[135:06.56]No.
[135:09.18]Yeah, I mean, we need Ballfondler.

[135:29.70]Okay, so I'm gonna go... Um, yeah.
[135:35.04]I'll do this.
[135:35.38]This one's taking a long time, what the fuck?
[135:45.72]Alright, I got that done.
[135:48.86]Jesus.
[135:52.87]Speak.
[135:53.95]Speak if you're here.
[135:54.89]Even though I just charted it, I guess it's good to, you know, redo my work.
[135:58.07]Exactly.
[135:58.57]I'm course correcting for you over here.
[136:01.77]I did my task over there.
[136:02.67]Okay, there we go.
[136:04.11]Beautiful.
[136:04.91]Is this one done?
[136:05.37]Congratulations.
[136:06.59]Thank you.
[136:08.56]What's the vent do?
[136:10.34]Wait, why'd you just look at that and then turn around?
[136:12.02]He just went in the vent.
[136:12.54]He just went in the vent.
[136:13.06]He just went in the vent.
[136:13.58]He just went in the vent.
[136:14.24]He just went in the vent.
[136:14.84]Oh my god, he actually did.
[136:15.54]He actually did.
[136:16.43]Oh my god!
[136:16.95]Oh my god!
[136:17.49]Report it!
[136:17.79]Report it!
[136:18.39]No one will believe you.
[136:20.67]Okay.
[136:20.97]He just said, no one will believe you.
[136:22.45]He just said, no one will believe you.
[136:23.65]You idiot!
[136:24.21]You dummy!
[136:24.71]You big dummy!
[136:25.67]I was there too!
[136:26.19]What are you doing with me, you little shy fucking thing?
[136:28.15]He went in the vent too.
[136:29.25]He vented.
[136:29.67]Who, me?
[136:30.11]Don't worry, Zam.
[136:31.11]I looked over.
[136:31.63]You were definitely doing a task.
[136:32.81]Wait, was he the one that vented or was there a different one?
[136:35.69]I think he vented.
[136:37.27]Wait, oh shit.
[136:39.79]Wait, wait, who was in the room with us?
[136:42.01]Who was in the room with us when we were?
[136:43.19]I was there with you.
[136:43.89]You were there, who else was in there?
[136:45.40]I did see you guys do tasks too, so.
[136:48.00]Who was, who went in the vent?
[136:49.52]I was down in shields.
[136:50.52]Vinny can confirm, I was pumping.
[136:52.28]Did you go in the vent?
[136:53.54]Or did you go in the vent?
[136:54.40]We were pumped.
[136:55.48]You can't ask them that, they're not going to tell you.
[136:57.84]I know, but who was in the room with me?
[137:00.06]I don't know.
[137:01.42]Who's in my room?
[137:04.94]It was you or you.
[137:05.93]I think it's you.
[137:07.85]It's you.
[137:08.19]Okay.
[137:10.09]Me and Rambo were in the room.
[137:11.63]Somebody vented.
[137:12.49]We said, holy shit, he vented.
[137:14.29]I don't know the one with the... The captain's room.
[137:17.41]The captain's room or something?
[137:18.47]Navigation?
[137:19.37]You vented.
[137:20.42]I saw you go in the vent.
[137:22.27]I was over in shields.
[137:23.95]Is there an event in shields?
[137:25.47]This isn't very complicated.
[137:26.85]Let me give my version of events.
[137:29.63]I see Jerma in navigation with Failboat and Ranboo.
[137:35.42]Jerma starts saying, he vented, he vented.
[137:37.60]And then while he's saying that, Yellow runs up and kills Ranboo.
[137:41.46]And Jerma goes, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[137:43.48]And then I report to the body.
[137:45.80]Okay, that's a fairly realistic interpretation, considering how I wasn't there.
[137:50.73]I was in shields.
[137:51.51]Vote, vote, vote.
[137:52.33]Yes, no, it's fail vote.
[137:54.61]It's fail vote.
[137:55.69]You can't see my name.
[137:56.73]You have no idea who I am right now.
[137:58.35]Thank you.
[137:58.79]I could never have done that as good as you did.
[138:02.54]You were just talking about venting for the last minute.
[138:07.12]Yep, there you go.
[138:10.16]It was very good explaining.
[138:11.40]Like a human.
[138:13.67]vent or yellow or orange one of those lighter I don't know yellow orange maybe I don't know you're ignoring the fact that you saw him literally kill I just I don't know man it's stressful okay well I can I can crack it I can trust you I can try I'm staying with you I can trust you what are you doing that for this is are you making a funny thing here
[138:41.55]I'm in storage with Criken, by the way.
[138:44.91]If anybody could hear me.
[138:50.50]I'm in storage with Criken.
[138:51.92]Criken and I are having a fun time.
[138:58.04]No, it couldn't have been you, because that couldn't have been you.
[139:00.75]You would have had to be in the menu.
[139:08.81]Loser said what?
[139:11.61]What is happening in here?
[139:12.43]We gotta fix this.
[139:13.68]He's kind of being weird.
[139:14.46]He won't talk.
[139:16.64]Okay, fixed.
[139:17.34]What do you mean, fixed?
[139:20.26]I just fixed the sabotage.
[139:21.74]No, you didn't.
[139:23.33]Yes, I did.
[139:23.89]What are you talking about?
[139:24.63]There's still another room.
[139:25.53]It's still counting down.
[139:26.95]It's counting down still.
[139:30.31]We're gonna lose.
[139:31.71]What?
[139:32.19]What happened?
[139:32.85]You guys just stood there for like two seconds.
[139:35.03]He was being weird.
[139:35.83]He wouldn't talk.
[139:37.23]You wouldn't talk.
[139:38.59]I killed in front of you.
[139:39.73]How did you think?
[139:57.68]He wouldn't talk to me.
[139:58.66]He was just being weird.
[140:00.60]It was fucking weird.
[140:02.89]I'm sorry.
[140:03.49]Good game.
[140:04.21]Good game.
[140:04.79]I should have went for the thing.
[140:06.79]I just wanted to see what he would do.
[140:10.33]What did he want to see what I would do?
[140:11.95]I'm scared.
[140:12.19]Ignored the sabotage thing.
[140:13.17]I thought you were going to kill me.
[140:22.59]I was more concerned about people knowing that I was in the room with you.
[140:24.94]This game is fun.
[140:25.84]This game is very fun.
[140:28.50]I mean, he's like behind me, like creeping up and looking at me.
[140:34.20]That's toxic, dude.
[140:35.54]I'm hosting the fucking room.
[140:36.72]What'd you say?
[140:40.89]He said kick Criken.
[140:43.03]He's trying to kick him.
[140:44.03]I'm gonna kill you first, alright?
[140:45.11]If you die first, it's literally me, alright?
[140:46.78]Criken.
[140:46.96]I got stuck in a vent that whole last round.
[140:49.26]I'm being gaslit.
[140:50.16]I couldn't get out.
[140:50.82]Mentally prepared.
[140:52.96]You can't say he's so bad.
[140:54.32]I'm being gaslit by my own crewmates.
[140:56.54]Fuck these creatures.
[141:00.50]People are like following me and like making noises behind me.
[141:05.33]Call O2 if you're funny.
[141:06.41]Call O2 if you're funny right now.
[141:07.61]If I die, it's Criken.
[141:08.41]He told me so.
[141:09.37]Call O2 if you're funny.
[141:11.84]No one's funny!
[141:12.70]Bunch of serious people in here.
[141:26.58]Please fix this.
[141:28.70]Please fix.
[141:37.81]Please fix.
[141:38.35]Is it fixed?
[141:40.41]Yeah, it's fixed.
[141:41.31]Alright, I was trying to... You're not the imposter, right?
[141:42.97]No, you would be dead right now.
[141:48.36]Criken, you told me if you were imposter, you'd kill me.
[141:52.22]I would, I mean, but you're not dead, are you?
[141:54.04]I mean, I don't want to... I didn't want to... I didn't mean to... I honestly... Skip, skip, skip.
[142:00.85]What do you have to say for yourself?
[142:02.45]This is very simple.
[142:03.31]What was that?
[142:03.83]Very simple.
[142:04.79]I was hovering my hand over it because I was scared that Criken was going to kill Vinny and I accidentally touched it.
[142:08.93]Skip.
[142:09.07]Skip.
[142:12.73]We were in this we were in the same room He was just creeping around behind Vinny, and I don't know you just think I'm creepy guy I'm just Vinny you can take the floor here cuz I don't know I

[142:37.48]I would skip.
[142:38.14]I did.
[142:38.48]Vinny.
[142:39.12]Vinny.
[142:39.36]Me and Criken had previous beef.
[142:40.91]It's fine now.
[142:41.51]Yes?

[142:56.00]Skipping vote.
[142:59.00]Skip the vote please.
[143:05.00]All we need is a mirror so we can touch our own faces when we look at each other. Oh that'd be pretty nice.
[143:09.00]I didn't mean to touch it.
[143:16.81]Alright.
[143:17.27]See you guys.
[143:18.31]It'll be a day of work.

[143:46.83]Baby, don't hurt me.
[143:48.15]Stay together.
[143:48.98]There's no reason to split up.
[143:51.64]I agree.
[143:52.04]Let's just go over here.
[143:53.20]Yeah, I'm sticking with Vinesauce.
[143:54.52]My good friend, Vinesauce.
[143:57.00]Criken, I'm sorry I have illed you.
[144:00.00]I have a license to ill.
[144:06.51]Can I get behind you here?
[144:07.51]I'm getting the silence right now.
[144:08.97]Scoot behind you.
[144:09.71]I'm sorry, man.
[144:14.55]All my tasks are on the other side.
[144:16.73]All my tasks are on the other side.
[144:18.05]This is a teleport, right?
[144:18.83]I can get quickly over there?
[144:19.79]Can you guys just click this right here?
[144:21.91]Just click that.
[144:22.93]Sure.
[144:24.37]See?
[144:25.19]Let me give it a shot.

[144:34.40]This is terrifying.
[144:35.54]He did it, he actually did it, he did it, he actually did it.
[144:38.48]He can't kill us, right?
[144:39.60]He actually did it.
[144:40.52]Press the button.
[144:40.92]Is this the cake or is this real?
[144:42.32]That son of a bitch.
[144:44.72]Oh, okay.
[144:46.94]Hold on one second.
[144:49.11]Hold on a second.
[144:50.07]And what's going on?
[144:52.15]What's going on?
[144:52.77]No bodies, no bodies.
[144:54.64]Let me take the floor.
[144:55.48]Let me take the floor.
[144:58.48]I was with Jerma and I was with Charborg.
[145:01.34]And I said, I just said, hey, can you guys go to the vent and click it?
[145:05.69]That way you can see if you're a sus.
[145:07.25]And you know what?
[145:08.35]Criken is the sus.
[145:10.57]What?
[145:12.15]It clicked on the vent, it clicked on the vent, and went inside.
[145:16.18]Is it these two?
[145:17.66]What?
[145:18.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[145:19.18]No, it's Charport.
[145:20.48]Guys, wait.
[145:21.06]Let me explain myself.
[145:22.44]Let me explain myself.
[145:23.51]Okay, how did you vent?
[145:24.87]Tell me how you vent.
[145:27.79]Let me live this round.
[145:28.89]Let me live this round, and I will kill Criken.
[145:31.65]It would be kind of funny.
[145:32.69]It would be kind of funny.
[145:33.47]That would be kind of funny.
[145:34.70]It would be funny.
[145:35.56]I mean, it's him.
[145:36.06]It's definitely, it's guaranteed to be him, but that would be kind of humorous.
[145:40.78]Please, I don't want to die.
[145:42.82]Guys, it's going to be so funny.
[145:44.42]He's going to die.
[145:45.16]Well, he had good logic just now.
[146:01.55]Oh.
[146:02.61]It's airtight.
[146:03.36]It's actually airtight.
[146:04.14]Well, we all know.
[146:04.76]We know who won it.
[146:05.66]There's two people in charport, though.
[146:07.18]Criken, I'm coming for you.
[146:08.58]No, please.
[146:09.28]You better run.
[146:10.60]You better run.
[146:11.40]Alright, alright.
[146:12.56]I kind of want to see this, actually.
[146:14.18]Can we all just watch?
[146:16.18]Let's just watch.
[146:18.64]Let's see.
[146:20.26]Let's see.
[146:20.86]Which room would you like to be in, Criken?
[146:22.54]I don't want to die, in general.
[146:23.94]I'm coming for you.
[146:24.98]This is going to be so funny.
[146:27.56]This is going to be so funny.
[146:29.38]There he goes.
[146:30.14]He just fucking did it.
[146:33.60]Now you believe that?
[146:34.99]Does anyone know what we do?
[146:37.59]He said he would kill Criken.
[146:38.97]He's killing Criken.
[146:39.77]We're fine.
[146:41.41]We're completely safe.
[146:43.41]We're completely safe right now.
[146:45.23]Don't worry.
[146:45.93]He's killing Criken.
[146:46.93]We can just chill.
[146:47.53]I want him out.
[146:52.34]You kind of just like pretended to not know that we all knew that it was him Anything that's a little weird what?
[147:19.79]No, I know I genuinely just forgot which green it was No, I just genuinely forgot which green it was I couldn't tell Can you can you stand by this vent and just just press the trigger?
[147:37.49]Yeah, sure.
[147:37.97]Yeah, sure.
[147:38.87]I can do that.
[147:39.27]Look look.
[147:39.79]I'm gonna press all my buttons Okay
[147:43.51]That'll sound like genuine button presses to me.
[147:45.63]There we go.
[147:46.07]See?
[147:46.63]I'm pressing buttons.
[147:47.36]See?
[147:48.84]See?
[147:49.14]I'm pressing the buttons.
[147:49.88]It's working.
[147:50.58]We're good.
[147:50.94]Okay, that's fair.
[147:52.16]That's good effort.
[147:53.52]Hey, look.
[147:53.97]He's coming at me.
[147:54.63]He's coming at me.
[147:55.19]He's coming at me.
[147:55.87]Hey, how are you?
[147:56.37]I'm watching you.
[148:02.42]What happened?
[148:02.94]I couldn't get him.
[148:03.64]What can I say?
[148:04.46]I couldn't get him.
[148:05.18]He was too quick.
[148:05.96]That was so funny.
[148:06.92]But you're still alive?
[148:08.41]No, no, no.
[148:12.29]He's out.
[148:14.07]No, he's out.
[148:14.77]He's out.
[148:15.81]Me and Failboat had a full deliberation for like a minute and a half, and you still haven't killed Criken?
[148:21.19]I was giving him a chance to talk, and then he just ran.
[148:24.06]You're bad at this game.
[148:25.06]I'm killing you.
[148:26.10]Alright.
[148:26.76]I understand.
[148:27.36]It's fine.
[148:28.04]Wait, how did you not kill him?
[148:29.88]You gotta be gone.
[148:31.08]I was just giving him a chance.
[148:32.02]I'm just good at this game.
[148:32.94]What can I say?
[148:33.96]You just avoided him the whole time?
[148:35.56]Green gang.
[148:36.44]Nice try.
[148:36.84]Good try, buddy.
[148:37.60]It was alright.
[148:38.82]You are a convicted felon, but it's okay.
[148:49.63]I think it's also possible to be you.
[148:51.17]Enjoy the rest of your round, everybody.
[148:52.73]It's not me.
[148:53.53]It's not me.
[148:54.89]It can't be me.
[148:55.51]Look at how many fingers I have.
[148:58.14]The other one is Home Alone.
[148:59.12]Don't you guys think it's kind of interesting?
[149:02.25]That nobody else died, cause oh wait, we're gonna wait for Criken to die, right?
[149:06.10]Got him.
[149:06.66]Got him.
[149:07.00]Got him.
[149:07.50]Got him.
[149:08.28]Got ya.
[149:08.72]Got ya.
[149:09.02]Got ya.
[149:09.70]Got ya.
[149:26.45]Yeah, I think I believe him.
[149:28.09]Why would he sell me?
[149:29.59]I believe him.
[149:32.35]I can prove it.
[149:33.23]I can prove it.
[149:33.99]Okay, I swear to you I can prove it.
[149:35.61]I can prove it.
[149:36.23]Watch me do this task.
[149:40.97]Somebody went that way.
[149:49.62]I'm here.
[149:50.52]I'm here.
[149:50.86]Kill me.
[149:51.40]Kill me.
[149:51.80]I'm here.
[149:52.52]I'm here.
[149:52.92]Kill me.
[150:05.88]Little bit of Arnold's voice.
[150:07.84]Stop being like a fucking weird comedian guy.
[150:09.81]Like, I've lost everybody.
[150:12.21]Oh, no.
[150:13.57]Oh, no.
[150:18.35]Quickly, hurry up.
[150:18.99]Okay, it is... Uh, quickly, quickly.
[150:23.67]Come on, I got it.
[150:25.41]You got it?
[150:26.75]I got it.
[150:27.55]Right?
[150:27.73]I did it, right?
[150:29.13]Yeah, I did it.
[150:32.03]I'll get him...
[150:33.94]Weird.
[150:36.20]I got it.
[150:36.50]I did it.
[150:37.70]I did it.
[150:40.85]What's happening?
[150:43.57]Calm down.
[150:44.31]Calm down.
[150:44.85]He's a little skittish, isn't he?
[150:48.49]Come here.
[150:49.05]Come to this.
[150:49.45]Yeah.
[150:49.73]What's up?
[150:49.95]What's up?
[150:50.21]What's up?
[150:50.55]I want to hear you click.
[150:51.75]Okay.
[150:51.87]I want to hear you.
[150:52.39]You want to hear me click?
[150:53.09]Okay.
[150:53.31]Okay.
[150:53.53]I got you.
[150:54.03]I got you.
[150:56.20]I clicked it.
[150:56.72]See?
[150:57.00]It didn't work.
[150:57.36]It's Home Alone.
[150:58.06]It's Home Al- WHOA!
[150:58.88]WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
[151:15.86]Uh I made it- everybody knows.
[151:25.86]Was it you?
[151:26.16]That was fucking demented.
[151:27.71]That was demented.
[151:34.35]Oh, yeah, no, sorry.
[151:35.69]Yeah, I had no idea.
[151:37.47]You were, like, you did the click noise, and I was convinced you were the sus.
[151:41.27]I just thought it'd be funny if I made a click noise instead of doing something.
[151:45.58]It was good, but I thought it was a complete omission of guilt.
[151:48.06]Time to vote.
[151:50.24]See, I'm guilty and innocent at the same time.
[151:55.68]I mean, you could do that.
[151:56.44]It may be a little bit late.
[151:58.42]Why would you want to be the imposter, you know?
[152:02.41]And when you kick me out, I'll do like a...
[152:05.15]I got room for one more.
[152:05.81]I'm getting a little gassed.
[152:35.96]COVID's kind of coming up here.
[152:38.19]Okay, I can't see.
[152:40.03]There goes the power.
[152:40.79]Okay, well.
[153:00.28]Task completed noise I've ever heard much Congrats, thanks Okay, so yeah, let's stick together.
[153:12.23]I mean like yeah, there's nothing better than that You know have concrete proof.
[153:16.97]Yeah, you have to go out on a win with this one.
[153:18.99]Oh
[153:20.53]And by we, which team are you referring to?
[153:23.67]The crewmates, of course.
[153:25.19]Of course, of course, because we are all crewmates.
[153:28.30]Of course.
[153:28.76]Hey.
[153:28.88]Are we all crewmates here?
[153:30.02]That one's easy.
[153:30.90]Is everyone crewmates here?
[153:31.94]Yeah, we're all crewmates.
[153:33.80]Everyone's got a good amount of fingers.
[153:35.16]Just a bunch of task doers.
[153:36.36]Just a bunch of task doers.
[153:37.42]Okay, well.
[153:38.83]We gotta go, we gotta go.
[153:39.71]We're all gonna die.
[153:40.65]We can't let them win.
[153:41.91]Another win.
[153:42.77]Another win off this.
[153:44.59]Shut up, guys.
[153:45.49]Come on.
[153:46.11]Get it together.
[153:46.75]Shut up.
[153:48.93]That's mean.
[153:49.75]I went the wrong way.
[153:56.73]Dude, I swear to God, I'm not doing this on purpose.
[154:09.35]Okay, okay.
[154:10.59]I was in a room with at least purple.
[154:12.68]I thought I saw a Criken.
[154:13.96]It's me, you, and there was one other.
[154:16.06]I think it was green.
[154:18.44]Which green?
[154:19.44]They're not going to admit.
[154:20.80]It was me, I was there.
[154:25.18]It's one of the three of us.
[154:26.42]I saw you.
[154:28.00]I did it.
[154:29.58]I killed him.
[154:30.43]And I did it like this.
[154:33.27]And I'll do it again.
[154:34.43]Look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't do it.
[154:36.57]No one died this time.
[154:38.17]We didn't die.
[154:39.95]No one died.
[154:41.79]I believe you.
[154:43.39]Pinky promise.
[154:45.37]It's been so long.
[154:46.57]Pinky promise.
[154:48.74]I actually don't think it was you.
[154:50.32]We now have no idea who it is, though.
[154:52.82]Trevor, why did you do it?
[154:53.60]He's just not a believer.
[154:57.52]I do have to say, though, that you are picking probably the worst person to be the person to confide in on this, so I think it was you.
[155:04.65]I hate you.
[155:05.19]Yeah.
[155:06.11]Uh, hey, uh, Bell Book did it.
[155:08.17]Yeah.
[155:09.95]Can I talk to you over here?
[155:12.05]I mean, you don't pick the sus guy, right?
[155:13.91]To be like, oh yeah, what he said is accurate.
[155:16.75]Yeah, this is my vouch right now.
[155:19.07]Yeah, I mean, that's incredibly sus.
[155:21.51]Yeah.
[155:22.13]There's like an interview going on over here.
[155:23.82]Hold on a second.
[155:25.52]Bell Book did it.
[155:28.33]I voted fail boat.
[155:28.91]But he might just be being a weirdo.
[155:30.67]Okay, that's perfect.
[155:56.61]Wait, so he's gonna kill red, so if red's dead, then it's charboard, and if not, then... I mean, we're good, right?
[156:01.65]Yeah, the proof is in the pudding.
[156:02.83]If red is dead... Yeah, you guys stick together, so if you die, then we'll know it's him.
[156:06.97]This isn't a weird plan where you guys plan for one of you to die.
[156:10.35]So you could be the one to point it out.
[156:12.03]I'm too stupid for that, I think.
[156:14.25]That one's locked?
[156:17.93]You're not gonna die on my watch, I promise.
[156:20.21]I'm just gonna, like, follow you.
[156:26.23]so I'm going to watch everything that happens from afar.
[156:28.41]Once I got a task, guys.
[156:29.89]Oh my god, I just touched something.
[156:31.57]That was weird.
[156:32.01]I felt like I touched something organic.
[156:34.21]That was weird.
[156:35.83]That was strange.
[156:36.29]How do you have organic stuff in your, like, computer?
[156:39.25]I don't know.
[156:39.67]I just, I tell you, I touched something and it was like an organic feeling.
[156:43.90]Wait, where is that?
[156:44.54]Where is that?
[156:44.88]Where is that?
[156:45.22]Where is that?
[156:47.82]Where is it?
[156:48.12]Where is it?
[156:48.68]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[156:49.96]Okay, okay, you're good, you're good.
[156:51.72]How do I do this one?
[156:52.68]I think the reactor may be melting.
[156:54.86]I got it.
[156:55.95]We're good.
[156:56.43]We're good.
[156:56.73]Great work, everyone.
[156:57.25]Great work.
[156:58.58]Great work, great work, great work.
[157:00.68]What's going on there?
[157:01.32]I walked in on Vinny and Zam.
[157:03.00]What are you guys doing?
[157:03.92]We just did the reactor.
[157:04.64]We're just doing tasks and finding out what Irma touched.
[157:07.74]Turn the power back on or whatever.
[157:09.32]Yeah.
[157:09.94]We're locked in here.
[157:11.53]Alright, never mind.
[157:15.97]Doing my task.
[157:17.13]Okay, I got a task in here, lads.
[157:19.09]Where'd Criken go, by the way?
[157:20.09]He was with us and then just kind of disappeared.
[157:23.58]Criken was with us for a second ago and then he just disappeared.
[157:27.01]Keep that in mind.
[157:29.07]Okay, I'm gonna get the lights back.
[157:32.07]Lights are back.
[157:33.45]Everyone still alive?
[157:34.21]Where did my buddy go?
[157:35.09]We're all still alive.
[157:36.84]Charborg is still alive.
[157:38.90]Hey, Charborg, have you seen Criken anywhere?
[157:40.68]Yeah, where's Criken?
[157:41.42]He ran up and said some suspicious stuff and then left.
[157:43.90]I think it's Criken.
[157:44.72]He's just kind of going off on his own.
[157:46.08]Who just locked us out of here?
[157:49.23]Who just locked us out of here?
[157:51.49]I didn't.
[157:52.37]I need to go here, though.
[157:53.67]How do we open this?
[157:58.07]There's no dead body in this room.
[157:59.95]There's no dead body in this room.
[158:02.88]Just so you guys know.
[158:03.88]I think it's Criken.
[158:04.58]Criken is just somehow just... Wait, where are you going?
[158:08.40]Wait, I didn't mean to go anywhere.
[158:10.34]I thought that was like a dramatic exit.
[158:12.34]What do you see in there?
[158:13.20]I don't know.
[158:26.33]He did it!
[158:27.07]Who did it?
[158:28.13]I was in the wall.
[158:30.55]It's red!
[158:32.31]It's red!
[158:33.45]I didn't see anything.
[158:34.19]I'm not kidding.
[158:35.89]Zamsire, do you have anything to say for yourself?
[158:38.63]Criken was running towards the body and it just fell on the floor.
[158:42.42]I don't know how else to explain it.
[158:44.54]I saw Criken walking down the hallway straight towards the guy and then he killed him.
[158:49.08]What?
[158:50.20]I saw you walk straight towards somebody, but then I went into a wall and it went all black and I didn't see anything after that.
[158:56.36]Okay.
[158:57.30]Here's what really happened, guys.
[159:00.91]So, my friend Rambu was over there and he was looking at me down a long hallway and I thought, what a great opportunity to do a jump scare.
[159:07.47]So I started slowly walking towards him like this.
[159:09.53]He starts screaming, right?
[159:10.76]He says, it's Criken.
[159:11.96]It's Criken.
[159:12.42]Criken's coming towards me.
[159:13.74]Then, out of nowhere...
[159:15.87]He explodes into blood, and red leaves the body on the floor.
[159:20.95]That's when I reported it.
[159:22.09]You can see that I reported it.
[159:23.93]Yeah.
[159:24.59]Yeah, see?
[159:25.03]You can see I reported it.
[159:26.03]This isn't blood.
[159:26.81]I actually can't corroborate this because I was in the wall.
[159:28.99]I saw him walk towards him.
[159:30.17]I watched the whole thing happen, and I know who did it.
[159:32.49]So who did it?
[159:33.55]I'm not going to say who did it.
[159:34.81]What?
[159:35.65]I know who did it, too.
[159:36.27]That's super cool of you, I guess.
[159:37.43]You know what?
[159:38.79]Let's all vote for who we think did it.
[159:40.61]Okay, that sounds good.
[159:41.83]And then what the...
[159:43.91]Okay.
[159:44.59]I don't know about this, but... I mean, I'm only going on information that I had.
[159:51.57]Which is you creepin', creepin' like this.
[159:53.97]Charlie, you hate me!
[159:54.81]You killed me!
[159:55.41]Take the fedora!
[159:56.53]I think it's the fedora, man.
[159:58.01]It's the fedora.
[159:59.00]It's literally the fedora.
[160:00.32]It's the fedora, man.
[160:01.60]What?
[160:01.84]Something about it.
[160:03.10]So then it had to have been you.
[160:04.86]It had to have been you, then.
[160:05.62]Wait, who else was in that room?
[160:08.26]Guys, it's either me or him.
[160:09.76]I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, buddy.
[160:11.30]I can't be sure which.
[160:12.66]Let's see if you're worthy of doing the imposter things.
[160:15.63]I am, I am.
[160:17.61]How likely are you to destroy your morals and your soul?
[160:20.05]I'll follow Red around the entire match.
[160:21.95]If I come back dead, if I'm dead next time... I'm going to start eating crackers really loud into the microphone.
[160:28.22]Somebody's got to get rid of me.
[160:29.92]Yes.
[160:31.16]See, just follow me.
[160:34.56]I will be doing my tasks.
[160:36.20]I'm just following Red.
[160:38.12]I'm worthy.
[160:43.35]Back me up.
[160:43.93]I'm telling you, he's about to kill.
[160:45.47]I am.
[160:45.75]I'm backing you up.
[160:50.29]I gotta stay far enough away.
[160:52.35]Just in case something crazy happens here.
[160:56.31]I got one more task.
[160:57.17]We gotta go.
[160:57.65]This guy's gonna kill me.
[160:58.57]Why are you leaving?
[160:59.77]What are you doing?
[161:00.60]Don't leave.
[161:01.70]Don't leave while you're split up like that.
[161:02.98]You're right.
[161:03.56]That was weird of you to do, by the way.
[161:05.26]Strange.
[161:05.84]I don't know why I did that.
[161:06.78]Very strange.
[161:09.30]That was a little strange.
[161:10.20]This guy's timer's about to be up.
[161:11.42]I can tell.
[161:11.90]Look at the way he's looking.
[161:12.62]He wants to kill.
[161:13.58]He's got bloodlust in his eye.
[161:17.85]In the menu, by the way.
[161:19.13]In the menu screen.
[161:21.44]In the menu screen.
[161:23.28]Oh, in the menu.
[161:24.74]Oh, look at me.
[161:25.24]In the menu.
[161:26.62]There we go.
[161:26.96]Yeah, it's here.
[161:27.44]I will do this.
[161:28.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:29.34]Did I do it?
[161:29.74]I did it.
[161:29.94]I did it.
[161:30.28]I did it.
[161:42.66]Yeah, I know you did.
[161:43.40]Exactly.
[161:43.92]I'm good.
[161:45.88]Tell me, have you sunk to the deepest depths of human depravity yet?
[161:50.42]I've sunk to the highest.
[161:53.36]Don't.
[161:54.29]That's weird.
[161:54.69]All the way up there.
[161:56.03]Not in the vent.
[161:57.13]Not in the vent.
[161:58.11]Alright.
[161:58.37]I got some tasks to do.
[161:59.23]I got to go do them.
[162:01.23]I would never vent.
[162:02.45]Not in the vent or anything.
[162:03.51]Okay.
[162:04.03]We're good.
[162:04.99]Let us see.
[162:05.93]Hey, look at this.
[162:07.77]He's kind of looking at me.
[162:09.33]Look at this.
[162:18.21]He's wondering how far you will descend into madness.
[162:21.79]How far will you go to win a match and lose your soul in the process?
[162:27.99]Let's see.
[162:35.26]Chad, I'm trying to turn him into the Joker.
[162:37.72]Let me have this.
[162:39.02]As I was saying, how far will you descend?
[162:41.42]Oh, shit.
[162:46.72]Do we do it?
[162:48.19]I just did that one.
[162:49.35]Wait, what?
[162:54.42]How do we... Where's the... Okay, we got it, got it, got it, got it.
[162:56.34]Oh, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[163:02.22]This is... I don't know.
[163:02.92]I actually don't know who it is.
[163:05.12]Yeah, I...
[163:06.96]It's definitely you, right?
[163:08.56]It has to be.
[163:09.52]It's not me.
[163:10.30]It can't.
[163:10.76]It's not me.
[163:11.54]I'd never do anything like that.
[163:13.61]Look, I believe you.
[163:14.37]Look at me.
[163:14.85]So I'm going to turn over here.
[163:15.81]We've known each other the past ten games.
[163:18.37]I'm the gosh darn captain.
[163:22.81]You remember when we were an imposter duo?
[163:25.11]You remember that?
[163:26.21]I do.
[163:26.49]It was pretty cool.
[163:27.21]We won that game.
[163:28.27]We won that game.
[163:29.03]We did win that game.
[163:30.31]Anywhere you want to go before you snap my neck?
[163:33.08]Anywhere you want to go before this happens?
[163:36.61]I think Ohio.
[163:37.77]Okay.
[163:38.75]Set a course for Ohio.
[163:40.03]Get that going here.
[163:41.23]Okay, and let's go ahead and drive, and okay, I'm ready.

[164:38.08]Wait wait, he won't kill me.
[164:40.42]I feel like 10 opportunities If this is him you said it was him Yes, you know me it is him guys.
[164:50.42]I saw him break someone's neck.
[164:51.68]I know it's him really really I'm so tangled up
[165:08.34]We must complete the tasks.
[165:10.54]Then we will win.
[165:17.19]Who is it then?
[165:18.33]Is it Vinny?
[165:18.81]I feel like I should be dead for like a... Are we gonna lose?

[166:20.17]Horrible.
[166:20.61]Shit.
[166:21.19]Please not me.
[166:21.91]Please not me.
[166:22.71]Please not me.
[166:23.17]Strange things start to happen.
[166:25.27]God damn it.
[166:27.83]I'm so happy that I'm not the imposter.
[166:29.47]This is awesome.
[166:30.05]Ooh, not again!
[166:30.73]I'm sorry, I hope I'm not making anybody sick, but I'm just so tangled.
[166:34.67]Okay.
[166:34.79]Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[166:35.57]I'm just gonna do tasks, you know what?
[166:54.46]Charge that up.
[166:59.74]Okay, that got that.
[167:02.76]Now I'm going to go down.
[167:06.54]This way.
[167:07.20]Okay.
[167:09.14]What's up?
[167:12.23]Hey, buddy.
[167:16.59]Hey, battle buddy.
[167:17.15]Hey, buddy.
[167:19.05]See anything suspicious lately?
[167:20.85]Not in this direction.
[167:23.01]What about that direction?
[167:25.38]On that direction.
[167:27.62]Okay, good.
[167:29.55]Good to hear.
[167:30.83]Good to hear.
[167:31.61]Guys, we got a task in this room.
[167:36.53]That was weird.
[167:37.01]Oops.
[167:38.85]That was weird.
[167:41.15]Weird.
[167:41.97]Okay.
[167:47.82]Where is it?
[167:48.50]Where is it?
[167:49.02]Oh, that's far away.
[167:50.42]That's far away.
[167:54.06]Please, not again.
[167:56.38]Please not again.
[167:58.28]If anyone can hear me, I'm doing the left one.
[168:00.52]Okay, I'm right behind you.
[168:02.52]I'm doing this one.
[168:03.06]I'm doing this one.
[168:03.62]Where's the other one?
[168:04.12]I've got to coordinate on these things.
[168:05.36]I got it.
[168:05.64]I got it.
[168:05.94]I got it.
[168:06.22]It goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[168:09.58]Okay, easy.
[168:10.80]Nice.
[168:10.96]Easy and done.
[168:11.48]Okay, good job.
[168:11.82]Easy and done.
[168:12.70]What?
[168:13.22]No.
[168:13.82]Shit.
[168:14.40]Fuck.
[168:15.08]No.
[168:15.42]Stupid.
[168:16.23]Idiot.
[168:16.73]What are you thinking?
[168:17.45]How?
[168:18.25]What?
[168:18.69]I trusted you.
[168:19.43]Ugh.
[168:24.79]But he did the task!
[168:27.67]He did the task!
[168:29.03]He did the task!
[168:31.51]He did the task!
[168:33.57]I watched him do it!
[168:35.01]And it stopped the meltdown, and I trusted him!
[168:40.75]I... I... What?
[168:44.76]He went, oh, boop, I did it, I did it, and then the thing stopped.
[168:46.94]So I was like, he had to have just done it!
[168:49.56]Oh... Oops.
[168:55.73]Did he?
[168:58.25]He saw that somebody else did it.
[169:01.03]He was walking around alone, too, saying, I'm going to go this way.
[169:03.74]Can you fucking believe this?
[169:04.94]Ridiculous.
[169:05.54]I mean, it could have been you, too.
[169:07.38]I shouldn't have given that explanation.
[169:09.50]You?
[169:09.70]No.
[169:09.80]No, no, no, you.
[169:11.24]No, it could have been, you know, the...
[169:25.16]He played you like a fiddle.
[169:27.30]Really.
[169:27.58]Nobody knows either.
[169:28.38]Nobody has any idea.
[169:29.10]I wonder who the other one is.
[169:30.18]Probably Criken.
[169:30.94]Oh, you know what?
[169:31.74]Tarborg was being weird.
[169:51.59]you went through eight stages of grief I was shocked I really didn't think it was I had no idea well I'm gonna do my tasks
[170:21.05]God dammit.
[170:24.51]I'm helping.
[170:30.49]I'm helping.
[170:34.87]Download.
[170:40.75]Is that one?
[170:41.15]What is that one doing?
[170:43.43]We can actually pilot the ship?
[170:47.26]What does this do?
[170:52.07]This is kind of fun.
[170:58.81]Cool.
[170:59.61]I know when my friend lies, and it sounds the same as when he's telling the truth.
[171:03.90]I think it's Criken.
[171:05.58]Hey, who's behind me?
[171:07.26]Mind, you know, sounding off real quick?
[171:10.60]Okay, that's cool.
[171:11.74]Just turn off the lights.
[171:12.38]That's fine.
[171:14.23]But I'm sure we're cool, because...
[171:18.82]No one's there, so we're all good.
[171:20.28]Maybe not.
[171:22.06]Oh, this could be acting.
[171:23.00]This could be acting.
[171:26.76]The other one was acting, too.
[171:28.38]Just alone, just talking.
[171:30.53]This is acting, I think.
[171:31.33]I'm so good at tasks.
[171:34.97]Oh, you're in trouble.
[171:36.29]Do one right now.
[171:37.49]I literally just did one.
[171:40.37]I was not looking.
[171:41.31]I'll follow you to the next one.
[171:43.56]Really?
[171:43.70]There it is.
[171:44.50]It was Vinny too.
[172:04.25]I was not expecting that.
[172:07.05]Let's go!
[172:08.55]I did not think.
[172:10.38]Just couldn't possibly.
[172:11.82]Just couldn't possibly.
[172:13.06]Shit.
[172:13.94]Who was pink?
[172:14.66]Who was pink?
[172:15.44]I had to become the light.
[172:17.64]Hello there.
[172:18.20]It was the pink on the hat.
[172:19.38]It was my heart.
[172:20.24]Oh my god.
[172:21.06]No way.
[172:21.26]You actually saw pink?
[172:22.10]Trickster.
[172:22.86]I knew I saw pink.
[172:23.58]I knew it.
[172:24.31]I can't believe.
[172:32.81]Why am I inside?
[172:33.81]This thing's like wrapping around me.
[172:35.07]Hey, high five.
[172:35.47]That was good.
[172:35.89]Good job.
[172:36.59]Good job.
[172:36.99]Good imposter.
[172:37.73]Oh.
[172:58.50]Excellent, excellent games.
[172:59.74]Yeah, I'm literally never doing this ever again.
[173:01.88]That was kind of depressing.
[173:02.74]Yeah, I mean, you never know, right?
[173:03.58]You never know.
[173:04.18]Maybe the Sus guy could come back and play a little bit more Among Us.
[173:25.37]You never know.
[173:25.91]I'm glad you could join us.
[173:28.67]No, this actually was a ton of fun.
[173:32.07]Yes, it was awesome.
[173:33.53]Absolutely fucking fun.
[173:34.76]Thank you for hosting, man.
[173:36.66]Hey, man, on a serious happy birthday.
[173:39.54]Thank you, I appreciate it.
[173:42.44]Yeah, that was way more fun than I... I never played this before, but actually, I'm a believer now.
[173:48.10]I'm an Among Us believer.
[173:49.99]That was a lot of fun.
[173:50.85]Thank you, seriously, everybody, for playing.
[173:52.61]It was.
[173:53.01]It was great.
[173:53.47]Yeah, thanks for playing.
[173:54.31]Thank you, guys, seriously.
[173:55.07]It was a lot of fun.
[174:17.76]Oh, let me get out of here.
[174:18.74]How do I leave the game?
[174:19.84]Well, I don't know how to leave.
[174:20.84]How do I leave?
[174:21.72]Oh, there we go.
[174:22.22]Oh, okay.
[174:22.46]There it is.
[174:48.65]Alright, guys.
[174:50.25]Yeah, I probably would have stuck around.
[174:51.37]How do I look?
[174:52.53]Let's see.
[174:53.15]How fucked up do I look?
[174:56.49]Probably pretty weird.
[174:57.25]I probably look fucking crazy.
[174:59.58]But no, that was a lot of fun.
[175:01.84]Channel's going to go back to normal, but thanks for participating, everybody.
[175:05.90]That was actually a blast.
[175:07.14]That was way more fun than I thought it was ever going to be.
[175:10.59]But I got to, like, go chill.
[175:13.11]I need to go get COVID out of my body.
[175:17.21]I hope it was a good time.
[175:18.31]I hope it was fun.
[175:20.45]Sus guy out.
[175:26.63]So I don't know.
[175:27.07]The next stream, I don't know when it's going to be.
[175:28.97]Probably a couple days.
[175:32.12]I really want to get better.
[175:35.36]So we'll see.
[175:36.44]Keep an eye on the sus.
[175:39.08]I know the joke was that I put a sub goal on the stream, but seriously, thank you, anybody that subscribed.
[175:43.84]It was...
[175:45.47]More for comedic purposes, but thank you.
[175:48.61]I'll see you guys later.
[175:49.47]Have a great rest of your night.
[175:52.11]Thanks, everybody that played.
[175:52.98]That was a good group.
[175:56.06]I'll see you guys in probably a couple days, two or three days.
[176:02.78]Take care of yourselves.
[176:05.48]There's going to be a lot of names here, probably.
[176:08.98]Let's see.
[176:10.34]Holy shit, how many people subscribed?
[176:17.89]Almost 1,400 subs.
[176:20.97]Jesus.
[176:21.37]1,400.
[176:23.17]No, no, no.
[176:23.61]More than that.
[176:25.92]Almost 2,000 subs.
[176:27.06]Holy shit.
[176:28.98]51 pages of subscriptions.
[176:31.98]Well, come on.
[176:32.86]At least I made a little bit of money on this stream.
[176:38.08]Actual sub farming.
[176:40.60]I will never do that again.
[176:42.32]Trust me.
[176:51.58]I'm going to put the headset down.
[176:52.56]Actually, no, I can't because you won't be able to hear me.
[176:58.19]I'll leave the SUS branding up for a few hours probably.
[177:01.65]Maybe later tonight or tomorrow I'll change everything back.
[177:11.16]Rip the SUS.
[177:20.37]You ever going to play this again?
[177:21.21]I know, I mean, the joke was that I wasn't, but maybe without the jokey branding and all the other shit.
[177:28.11]Maybe, yeah.
[177:30.08]The thing about me in VR, though, is I do it for like a week, and then I put it away for six months.
[177:35.68]So I really don't know.
[177:37.76]We'll see.
[177:43.31]Yeah, good night, guys.
[177:44.91]See you later.
[177:46.39]I'm not rating anybody, but there's a lot of people here.
[177:49.83]So if any of the other people that were in that lobby are still streaming, go sprinkle out around them if they're still live.
[177:55.27]Because that was a really fun group.
[178:04.90]And I'll see you guys soon.
[178:05.62]Good night.
[178:06.04]Goodbye.
[178:07.68]Take care of yourselves.
[178:09.64]See you later.
[178:22.59]you
[178:57.48]you
