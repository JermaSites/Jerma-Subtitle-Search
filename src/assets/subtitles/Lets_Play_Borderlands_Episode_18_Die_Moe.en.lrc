[04:24.15]Oh, my God.
[04:26.51]Man, I'm not doing... I'm doing 15 damage a shot while I'm evolving.
[04:34.68]That is bad.
[04:47.48]Go, bird.
[04:49.50]These guys are taking a lot of hits.
[04:50.58]Watch how he's gonna slam the ground.
[05:01.36]I'm lighting him on fire, man.
[05:02.76]Oh, shit.
[05:03.42]Shoot his mouth.
[05:11.45]Shoot his mouth.
[05:12.07]Here, try and launch bomb.
[05:12.93]Oh, God.
[05:13.33]Oh, Jesus.
[05:17.50]There's another one down here, too.
[05:18.78]I'm out of ammo and all my guns.
[05:20.68]Yo, let's at least try and get this one guy down.
[05:22.60]I need to go for ammo.
[05:24.72]Oh, shit, there's another skag.
[05:27.84]Man, it's Moe and Marley.
[05:30.17]Moe's at, like, almost half.
[05:31.89]Actually, he's at lower than half.
[05:43.42]Yeah, I'm pretty much out of ammo, too.
[05:53.65]You got a badass skag too.
[05:54.97]A lot of skags.
[06:00.21]Moe's running away.
[06:00.87]Oh, I'm going down.
[06:01.93]Oh yeah, I went down too.
[06:04.11]Come on, come on, come back here, come back here.
[06:07.34]Yeah, there we go.
[06:09.84]Take my hits.
[06:14.58]Oh no, ammo, are you kidding me?
[06:16.10]Oh, there we go.
[06:17.58]I was going to say, no way.
[06:22.42]give it to me, give me all this stuff.
[06:23.46]Come on.
[06:25.44]You killed someone?
[06:27.00]No, I killed one of the Skaggs.
[06:29.87]Moe's almost done, he's at like 30% health left.
[06:33.59]I have like nothing, no ammo, nothing.
[06:37.65]Do you want me to just kite him around?
[06:38.85]Do you want to run back and get some health or ammo?
[06:41.89]I need to see how I'm going to go about doing that because I'm completely out of everything.
[06:47.39]God.
[06:49.45]I'm getting tossed around.
[06:51.86]I've got to get out of here.
[06:55.80]I'm coming.
[06:58.17]No!
[06:58.91]Miss Alpha Skaggs is almost dead.
[07:02.21]Alright, run, run, run, run, run.
[07:06.71]It's just Moe and Molly.
[07:07.77]They're the only ones at the left.
[07:08.87]I want to take out Moe.
[07:18.78]I mean, I'm out of ammo already.
[07:22.97]I have a few shots of the revolver and that's it.
[07:24.69]You know what it is?
[07:32.60]We gotta shoot him from behind.
[07:33.60]That's what it is.
[07:34.68]It takes much more damage from behind.
[07:40.56]Come on.
[07:44.00]Alright, I got... Oh!
[07:47.95]Moe is about to die.
[07:48.77]No shit!
[07:50.45]Moe is, uh... I'm gonna kill Moe.
[07:57.44]I equipped the wrong shield.
[08:02.80]Oh my god.
[08:04.28]Bird, go.
[08:05.77]Moe is going to die in one second.
[08:11.09]Oh, you die.
[08:11.83]There we go.
[08:14.59]Alright, Moe's dead.
[08:15.71]Nice.
[08:15.91]Now we're just going to kill Marley.
[08:17.95]Now we're just going to do that all over again and kill Marley.
[08:31.13]Well, that was useful.
[08:34.67]Yeah, what it is, somebody's got to go from behind.
[08:36.91]Somebody has to go from behind.
[08:38.07]Oh, my God.
[08:38.71]Oh, boy.
[08:44.20]I have no ammo.
[08:44.78]That's the problem.
[08:49.18]I have six shots in the revolver, and, you know, I'm going to throw... I have an SMG, and it has, I think, like 300 rounds, so... You can just take it.
[09:00.97]I'm going to try and go and scavenge.
[09:03.29]I think there's a place where I can buy around here.
[09:11.09]Want me to go back up there to make sure he doesn't regen health or anything?
[09:13.65]Oh, yeah.
[09:15.82]Here, I'm going to... Oh, shit.
[09:18.74]Really?
[09:20.18]Skag whelp is coming after me.
[09:25.00]Why is there nowhere where you can buy ammo around here?
[09:27.90]It's kind of sketchy.
[09:31.61]uh... looks like molly is still here is yet for all he looks like he is at full health no way
[10:12.16]Let's see if I can get you, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[10:13.92]Nooo!
[10:15.80]Oh, got ya!
[10:28.16]Oh man.
[10:32.37]Oh!
[10:37.67]No, I'm dead, I'm gonna go down too.
[10:42.94]Use your health kits, we have more.
[10:45.40]I don't have no health kits left.
[10:48.42]Jesus.
[10:50.80]Kind of over our heads here.
[10:52.61]Not good.
[10:55.73]I don't know what we're doing wrong.
[10:57.19]Am I good enough for the rocket launcher yet?
[11:00.89]Oh, I mean, if we could kill him with the rocket launcher... Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[11:06.13]This is going to work out very nicely.
[11:08.61]Nice.
[11:09.57]Alright, let's do this thing.
[11:16.22]Yeah, let me just get another thing out.
[11:18.94]Just gonna pour a rocket into his face?
[11:21.68]Yep.
[11:22.38]Alright, I'll just go get him.
[11:26.16]You take the shot.
[11:28.72]Well, clearly I don't have any other ammo stuff.
[11:31.06]Alright, where is he?
[11:33.82]I don't know.
[11:35.72]Come here, Marley.
[11:38.37]It's kind of sad to kill him though.
[11:40.53]From Marley and me.
[11:42.75]Marley and me.
[11:44.89]Where is he?
[11:46.75]Ah, I don't know.
