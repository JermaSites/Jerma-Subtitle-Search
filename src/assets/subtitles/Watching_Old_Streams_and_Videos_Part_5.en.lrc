[00:04.69]Early Andy.
[00:05.49]No, right on time Andy.
[00:07.79]Precisely on time.
[00:12.13]2.01 Pacific time.
[00:14.97]How you doing?
[00:22.38]Well, 2.01.
[00:24.03]Okay, so in the time it takes to go from 2 to 201 is 59 seconds, right?
[00:33.15]So technically, if I show up at 2 and 58 seconds, I'm still on time.
[00:48.97]What, you're gonna like, you're gonna like look over my shoulder and see when I clock in?
[00:58.31]You know, like, what if you, like, just forget to clock in?
[01:00.17]Or what if you clock in, okay, what if you get there and you have to go to the bathroom or something?
[01:04.73]You're like, shit, I gotta, I gotta take a piss real quick.
[01:08.66]To me, okay, as your boss, right?
[01:11.30]I'm, as your boss, you've got, you've got, like, a 10-minute window there.
[01:17.08]And I'm talking before or after.
[01:18.54]It doesn't matter, right?
[01:19.20]Like, you've got, like, a 10- to 15-minute window where I don't give a shit at all.
[01:29.40]Did you clock in at like 2.08?
[01:34.74]I don't give a shit at all.
[01:36.24]I don't care.
[01:43.87]You know why I have that philosophy?
[01:47.45]Sometimes I'm two hours late.
[01:51.35]I'm two hours late, but you better be within 10 minutes.
[01:56.33]It's not.
[01:57.27]No, you could show up an hour late too.
[01:58.77]Alright, that's fine.
[02:05.25]What an excuse.
[02:06.09]No, I don't- I don't- Punctual- punctual- I'm not punctual.
[02:13.96]Look, shit happens every second of every day.
[02:18.54]Oh, you got something to do at like exactly at 2 p.m., right?
[02:22.46]Yeah, but like what if you need gas or something?
[02:24.16]Like, oh fuck, I didn't get gas.
[02:26.39]Just go get gas.
[02:26.95]I don't care if it's like 205, 260.
[02:28.60]I'm not going to look at the clock and wait for you.
[02:32.48]Now, if it's more than 30 minutes, then I'm going to text you and be like, is everything alright?
[02:36.98]Within 10, 15, 20, who cares?
[02:39.18]What are we doing today?
[02:47.16]That's a good question because it's going to be really fun.
[02:50.92]Today, we are going to be doing a stream, a special stream.
[02:57.58]did this about a year and a half ago two years ago and we're gonna do it again uh there's been requests to bring this back it's a really fun time I don't know what we're gonna get it's a gigantic gotcha of every single video and broadcast I've ever done now what does that mean so lazy luke
[03:20.39]Sort of the community webmaster here.
[03:23.17]Put together this kind of randomizer of everything I've ever done.
[03:26.25]A couple years ago.
[03:29.27]And we did it.
[03:30.63]And there's a... I think as of now, since it's been updated.
[03:34.56]The last year or two of streams has been put in here too.
[03:37.74]So we might get something that happened like a week ago.
[03:40.90]So what happens is... It's a little randomizer site.
[03:45.28]You click a button.
[03:46.86]And it's going to give you... A random...
[03:50.27]timestamp of a random VOD or video over the last 11 years and it totals out to be something like four over four thousand hours of video which is about 170 days so if you just let this go and just watch every single thing I've ever done it would take you 170 days straight 24 hours
[04:19.49]Which is weird to think about.
[04:20.81]I'm surprised there's that much even.
[04:22.79]It's weird.
[04:26.13]And we're gonna watch the whole thing.
[04:28.03]No, we're not.
[04:29.29]There's gonna be a few rules here.
[04:30.51]We better get cracking.
[04:33.13]No, just hold on.
[04:33.91]There's rules.
[04:34.49]You have to follow the rules.
[04:37.37]Rule number one.
[04:39.05]Each one of these has a timer of 120 seconds.
[04:42.93]I am thinking of making that higher or lower.
[04:44.87]I don't know.
[04:45.73]We have to kind of come to a community consensus on this here.
[04:49.75]I get five vetoes guess what you get five vetoes too because if chat is if chat really wants to skip something and there's a lot of people in the chat saying skip skip skip skip skip right we'll take a general consensus and we'll do a poll if you vote to veto that we means we skip but I think two minutes is too low if vetoes are in play
[05:18.54]Well, that's not gonna work.
[05:19.54]Well, then I just get five vetoes.
[05:20.84]Who cares?
[05:21.16]I'm in control of this ship.
[05:26.81]So, I get five vetoes.
[05:27.95]I gotta make sure I use them correctly.
[05:30.83]Five minutes?
[05:31.31]I think five minutes is too long.
[05:33.85]Three?
[05:34.66]Two?
[05:35.22]How long?
[05:35.58]What do you think?
[05:40.18]Five minutes is, like, as long as entire videos I used to make were.
[05:43.86]Three minutes?
[05:44.28]Yeah, three's good.
[05:44.96]Three's good.
[05:51.25]That's 180 seconds.
[05:54.77]So, we got a lot of Nancy Drew last time.
[06:00.85]And also, this is reverse vetoes, too.
[06:03.65]Right?
[06:04.06]If I want to stay for more than three minutes, we're staying for more than three minutes.
[06:08.98]Also, to make this a little more interesting, there's going to be a bingo card.
[06:18.25]Of various things that have happened over the years.
[06:21.49]You know what, let's just do this.
[06:23.07]Let's get over here.
[06:24.67]I pressed it one time and I will watch it for two minutes, okay?
[06:28.44]I promise.
[06:30.56]I want to show the board.
[06:32.44]We're going to make it even more interesting.
[06:38.12]Okay, so here we go.
[06:40.10]So, let's change that to 180.
[06:41.36]As you see here...
[06:48.62]Uh, a lot of these are very possible.
[06:52.81]If this shows up on the broadcast, we obviously have to put up a stamp on it, right?
[06:58.25]Like this.
[07:00.63]And if you get bingo, if bingo, big rigs in the background, I know.
[07:06.91]If you get bingo, then I didn't really think of, I don't know, I'll give 100 community subs.
[07:12.76]That sounds easy, right?
[07:15.05]How about this?
[07:15.39]I'll give 100 community subs if you get bingo.
[07:19.71]I'll give... Hold on.
[07:23.00]How much should I give?
[07:24.76]How many subs should I give?
[07:26.94]Let me think of how... Okay, hold on a minute.
[07:33.77]What's 250 subs?
[07:35.03]How much money is that?
[07:37.83]It's a lot, right?
[07:40.33]I can't do math in my head.
[07:42.21]It's...
[07:45.82]1,200 bucks.
[07:47.94]That's $2,500.
[07:52.02]1,200 bucks.
[07:52.49]1,250.
[07:52.61]Okay.
[07:53.57]Alright.
[07:55.11]If you fill the whole board, if we fill the whole board in this stream... By the way, I have to give a time limit on this stream because if we stay here long enough, we're going to fill the whole board in at least three or four hours.
[08:06.93]Horizontal row four is going to be so easy.
[08:10.72]You think so?
[08:12.87]I don't think doy- I haven't done doy doy doy that.
[08:15.83]Look, okay, we'll go over these, because I want to make sure this is really, really, very clear.
[08:20.25]Jack's moment is when I'm playing a game very, very well.
[08:23.10]Has to be incredibly clear.
[08:24.62]Not just like, oh, you jumped to that platform correctly.
[08:27.12]No, like a gamer moment, where it's like, holy shit, I can't believe you just did that.
[08:31.75]Look at me, poses, you know, I don't know.
[08:35.23]You know what I'm talking about.
[08:36.07]When I put my arms in weird places.
[08:37.73]Pog face, we know that.
[08:40.91]Rants are fine.
[08:41.93]Rants, you know, I just go off and start talking about something like crazy.
[08:44.23]And a rant is not me bringing up any topic.
[08:46.29]It's a rant.
[08:48.61]Ball joke, we all know that.
[08:49.73]That's when I deliberately fall off of a cliff to make everybody laugh and write LUL and make me, you know, feel happy.
[08:56.40]Character voices, any impression or character that I'm doing.
[08:59.46]One guy is you.
[09:01.61]auto is auto glitch you don't need a gambling is any gambling on stream uh it's I'm not gonna say that's like could that be debt oriented no I think that's on here isn't it no yeah okay yeah debt is already on here see debt ordeal gambling is not debt ordeal as well it has to be like I'm playing blackjack or I'm like gambling on the on stream
[09:28.90]Uh, naked is when I talk about, maybe if I talk about being naked, which happens a lot, uh, Drew Crew.
[09:37.12]It's, I don't think that's gonna show up, because there's another two years worth of streams.
[09:41.71]It just became way less likely, percentage-wise, that Drew Crew will show up.
[09:47.19]What else is, uh, could be on here that might be?
[09:50.83]You're saying an emote out loud is another one.
[09:53.43]If TF2 shows up, if a wrestling video shows up, or if I get scared.
[09:58.81]If you get bingo, 100 community subs.
[10:01.25]If you fill the whole board in three hours, I'll give 250 subs.
[10:05.99]How's that sound?
[10:13.15]You just did all, I know, I understand, bingo.
[10:16.11]I know, what about being high?
[10:18.92]No, that's not on here.
[10:20.80]A lot of community members helped with this.
[10:23.06]There's been a couple of iterations.
[10:24.62]Kind of just grabbed from a bunch of what people were talking about.
[10:27.24]Different mods, community members.
[10:28.42]So if you contributed to this, thank you.
[10:30.62]It makes the stream that much more fun.
[10:33.52]And I think we can go.
[10:37.39]So can we get maybe a link to this?
[10:39.35]You probably linked it a few.
[10:41.50]Three and a half hours or the deal is off.
[10:43.46]What?
[10:46.24]No, three hours is perfect.
[10:49.50]There you go.
[10:49.90]If you want to open it up and play for yourself, and if you want to open it up so you can scream at me when something happens.
[10:57.51]Are you ready to go through the ages?
[11:01.26]By the way, to test it, I was going back and forth with, uh, Luke last night.
[11:06.06]I've tested it a few times.
[11:08.07]And, um, I landed on a really, really kind of, like, cringey TF2 video that was, like, a live commentary, and I, like, hated it.
[11:14.01]So, I'm very ready to use my five vetoes.
[11:19.66]I'm so ready.
[11:21.16]I don't- I have to be careful, though.
[11:22.26]I have to see if I can stomach some of those older videos.
[11:24.36]Because if I can, then I can save my vetoes for something very important, right?
[11:30.37]alright so let's get this off make sure the timer is correct okay so this is three minutes and I did press it once already so this is I believe a youtube video of on the main channel is this the worst game this is okay are you ready I'm ready
[11:55.03]Let's go.
[11:55.79]In three, face cam.
[11:57.49]Not yet, if you're good.
[11:59.47]Three, two, one, go.
[12:05.18]Oh, look at how much fun this is.
[12:06.78]God damn it.
[12:07.30]That's not a voice, is it?
[12:08.32]Is that a character voice?
[12:10.21]It's almost a 90 degree angle.
[12:11.65]I gotta do it.
[12:15.68]That doesn't count.
[12:18.04]That's not a funny- I do that so often.
[12:20.58]Sick Tony Hawk ramp.
[12:22.44]That doesn't count.
[12:23.16]I'm playing on a half pipe right now.
[12:24.72]That's not a character voice.
[12:25.68]That's me doing me voice.
[12:27.26]Can we do like a 720?
[12:28.08]Just a game glitch?
[12:29.14]God damn it.
[12:29.98]No.
[12:30.50]Already?
[12:30.88]Hold on.
[12:31.22]Hold on.
[12:31.80]Alright.
[12:32.06]Fun's over.
[12:32.86]Go through.
[12:34.38]This is awful.
[12:35.22]I'll take game glitch is fine.
[12:36.86]Game glitch is fine.
[12:37.44]This game is fucking awful.
[12:40.10]Truly.
[12:41.14]Truly a disgraceful game.
[12:44.76]I can't think of anything worse.
[12:45.83]I really can't think of a game that's worse than this.
[12:49.11]Okay.
[12:49.91]This is not a rant!
[12:50.47]This isn't even a video game.
[12:51.27]No, it's not!
[12:52.07]It's not a rant!
[12:53.35]This is not even a video game.
[12:55.11]Oh, here, here's a bridge.
[12:56.69]Oh, good bridge.
[12:57.89]That was fun.
[12:59.13]Yeah, it was fun going over something with no detection on it.
[13:03.23]No, it's not a rant.
[13:04.13]That's complaining.
[13:05.59]I don't know, man.
[13:07.37]If somebody can tell me in the comment section a game that's worse than this... Can you think of one?
[13:13.37]It's going to be pretty tough.
[13:15.49]I can't think of anything.
[13:17.81]Not the... Oh.
[13:19.89]No, it's okay.
[13:21.35]Oh, look.
[13:21.63]There's my buddy.
[13:22.61]He's yelling on him.
[13:23.21]There's my friend.
[13:24.09]Hey.
[13:25.07]Hey, remember when you... You are a winner.
[13:29.51]Oh, hey.
[13:29.77]Don't worry, guys.
[13:30.73]You are a winner.
[13:33.16]We'll do random race.
[13:35.06]Oh, I wanna veto this already.
[13:36.06]Random race.
[13:36.82]Sounds like fun.
[13:37.94]No, that's not a voice!
[13:38.90]That's me going like this!
[13:40.32]That's not a voice, that's me just changing my voice to be, like, funny for a second.
[13:44.36]Alright, we're in like a- What?
[13:49.07]What?
[13:49.51]Three minutes is too long?
[13:50.83]No, I didn't do anything!
[13:53.05]Why did I just win the game?
[13:54.21]It didn't- I didn't even have a chance to move!
[13:58.45]What?
[13:58.67]Do it again!
[14:00.75]That was stupid.
[14:02.57]Alright, thanks for the win.
[14:03.57]I'll take the victory.
[14:05.05]I'll have my KD go up.
[14:06.63]Or my win-loss go up.
[14:08.69]This is old video.
[14:10.01]What the fuck?
[14:11.78]Stop doing this.
[14:13.26]Is it how much time is in the video?
[14:14.44]Random race.
[14:15.02]There's not even enough time in the video to get to the end of the timer.
[14:17.28]Stop giving me the victory automatically.
[14:19.94]This game is trying to tell me to stop playing.
[14:23.64]Ready?
[14:25.06]You are live.
[14:27.94]Alright.
[14:28.48]Alright, hold on.
[14:34.54]The timer's... The video's gonna end.
[14:39.33]Alright, so we have to go over this because people are freaking out about this.
[14:43.07]No, that is not... I understand that this is a game glitch, right?
[14:49.63]But, no, that doesn't count as a voice.
[14:51.85]None of that counts.
[14:57.69]Anger does not equal rant.
[14:58.67]That's correct.
[15:02.85]That's the prime of your career.
[15:07.13]I'm not cheating.
[15:07.95]That doesn't count.
[15:11.42]Alright.
[15:13.74]Let's go.
[15:14.22]Let's go.
[15:14.54]Here we go.
[15:14.88]Ready?
[15:15.04]Go.
[15:17.82]Where are we going?
[15:22.72]Oh, shit.
[15:22.96]I fucked it up.
[15:23.46]Alright.
[15:23.66]Here we go.
[15:27.15]People out of here.
[15:28.71]This is the movies.
[15:29.83]What happened to the... Oh, the timer.
[15:30.63]Oops.
[15:30.75]Who are these people?
[15:35.15]Extra, extra.
[15:35.85]No, we don't want this many extras.
[15:37.27]This is the movies part one.
[15:41.74]Oh, okay.
[15:44.30]That's fine.
[15:44.58]That's fine.
[15:44.86]Alright.
[15:48.66]Okay, we're in the bathroom still.
[15:51.10]It's not a problem.
[15:54.34]Somebody enter.
[15:55.18]Here comes the guy with the fucking axe.
[16:00.13]It's the same lady.
[16:03.19]It's a fall joke.
[16:04.01]Fine.
[16:04.51]Fine.
[16:04.73]Somebody comes in with an axe.
[16:09.22]Is it?
[16:09.80]Is it that same person?
[16:11.44]Yeah, it is.
[16:15.75]God damn it.
[16:16.57]Are you fucking kidding me?
[16:18.25]Hold on.
[16:19.13]There's too many people in the bathroom.
[16:23.81]Alright.
[16:26.57]Prop.
[16:27.75]Bashing object.
[16:28.72]I'm going to do free space too.
[16:31.74]I have to group these together so I don't have to keep pressing this.
[16:34.10]She walks in twice.
[16:36.96]She walks in twice.
[16:37.84]Only two more.
[16:38.76]That was someone who was going to get hit.
[16:43.68]Horror shot.
[16:44.26]Crane shot.
[16:46.87]That's not a laughing fit.
[16:47.96]No way.
[16:52.86]You know what a laughing fit is here.
[16:54.20]That's not it.
[16:56.44]No, it's going to be horror shot two.
[17:01.04]Now, where's the camera during this whole thing?
[17:04.70]Dress set.
[17:06.28]Oh, there's so much shit to do here.
[17:07.63]I can't wait to fucking like to spend a million years here.
[17:10.66]remember playing this this was so new oh god I missed this this is weapons I wish they would just make another one of these so bad okay um this is just the intro that's gas lighting you yeah how do we preview alright let's alright toggle to the free camera okay free camera
[17:40.41]I wish they'd make it redo this whole thing and make more intuitive controls.
[17:44.47]It would be so good.
[17:45.35]No, that's not.
[17:48.51]This is ready for casting.
[17:55.68]Maybe I should do those tutorials.
[18:02.12]I can stomach this one.
[18:03.13]I can.
[18:06.11]I just want to see what happens here.
[18:07.49]Do I have any more actors?
[18:10.86]Yeah, just knock on it.
[18:17.70]Where's our... 9... 10 seconds.
[18:22.76]Where the hell... Come on, these are our actors, man.

[18:36.25]You, climb up here with me.
[18:38.97]That's all.
[18:44.77]I hope this isn't a Jax moment.
[18:46.03]I hope not.
[18:47.15]I should have known.
[18:53.71]No, I'm gonna get pissed at this.
[18:54.79]I remember being really mad at this shit.
[18:57.11]I thought this was horrible.
[18:58.03]Yeah, I hated this.
[19:02.68]What's the fastest way to deal with this?
[19:06.96]What the fuck was that?
[19:08.82]Alright, this is a really good show you're putting on.
[19:12.58]That it's in vain.
[19:20.51]He just kicked his own- his friend.
[19:21.95]One goes down, get the other.
[19:26.94]No, that wasn't a voice.
[19:28.36]Not even close.
[19:29.06]Alright, gotcha.
[19:37.25]You look like a middle-aged magician.
[19:49.19]I actually can't believe that worked.
[19:51.09]I cannot believe that worked.
[19:54.56]Not wrestling at all.
[19:55.52]Not even close.
[19:56.46]Nice comedy movie.
[19:59.18]If anything, this is going to be me pissed off.
[20:06.47]What game is this?
[20:07.09]I don't know what game this is.
[20:09.85]You have an egomaniac mug?
[20:15.31]I don't know.
[20:15.73]Here's a hypothesis.
[20:19.05]A present from my mother?!
[20:20.11]Okay, so they cannot hurt me ever.
[20:23.26]Just wait for them to do that, and then they'll eventually hit each other.
[20:26.00]Like that.
[20:26.32]Just stand in the middle.
[20:28.78]And just hold R1.
[20:29.36]Wait till they... Did I take too long?
[20:34.21]Yeah, I bought this on my own free will.
[20:36.65]Yeah, they're identical.
[20:37.37]They're a mirror, so they're gonna run into each other.
[20:44.25]45 seconds!
[20:44.55]The motion captured real twins, man!
[20:51.76]Why did you play this but not Yakuza?
[20:53.40]I played this... I played this for like 25 minutes!
[20:55.88]That was close, but it doesn't count.
[20:57.28]No, that doesn't count.
[21:10.29]Alright.
[21:10.75]Throw knife.
[21:11.95]Cross the map.
[21:12.93]Throw Tomahawk.
[21:13.51]That's not a character.
[21:14.21]No.
[21:14.29]That's me.
[21:15.01]End of the fucking montage.
[21:17.49]End of the video.
[21:18.65]Tomahawk kill.
[21:19.29]Cross the map on Nuketown.
[21:20.42]Thank you very much.
[21:21.84]Imagine if I had Call of Duty reference on here.
[21:24.46]I'll put it in your montage.
[21:25.64]Funny.
[21:26.40]Montage joke.
[21:27.70]Alright.
[21:28.20]You get it.
[21:28.64]Fine.
[21:29.56]I like how I'm not even breathing or moving.
[21:31.82]GTA 4 multiplayer.
[21:32.78]Too much laughing.
[21:33.81]Instant headache.
[21:34.95]We know what's happening here.
[21:37.65]Statue.
[21:40.97]This is an old YouTube video.
[21:44.99]Just stay like that the whole time.
[21:46.77]Don't laugh, Jeremy.
[21:47.99]Don't laugh.
[21:48.89]This has got to be this part of this video where there's no laughter, right?
[21:51.98]Let's set up the joke.
[21:52.72]Don't do it, please.
[21:53.26]I'm just like delivering my statue to like the art museum.
[21:58.30]Don't do it.
[22:01.07]That's him laughing at me.
[22:01.85]It doesn't look like it.
[22:03.09]Oh, don't do it.
[22:04.67]Alrighty then.
[22:05.40]Let's go get a helicopter.
[22:07.06]Alrighty then.
[22:09.06]Alrighty then.
[22:09.92]These guys are so much fun.
[22:11.22]My car right now looks like... You know when your dog gets into one of your toys and absolutely ruins it?
[22:18.42]Yeah.
[22:19.10]What do you mean one of your toys?
[22:21.91]It's like this is the most messed up car I've ever driven in.
[22:24.87]One of your toys?
[22:27.07]Everything is exposed.
[22:28.09]What?
[22:28.47]Do I have a dog toy?
[22:29.55]I'm at the airport right now.
[22:31.45]Let me guess, that's you in that right now.
[22:35.60]That is you.
[22:36.34]You know, I'm like contemplating vetoing every YouTube one.
[22:39.70]What was that?
[22:41.16]What'd you do?
[22:42.20]What was that?
[22:44.54]I just ran you over.
[22:45.32]You just ran me over behind?
[22:47.97]No, laughing.
[22:48.87]This is great.
[22:49.61]I was driving so fast.
[22:51.15]Dude, on my screen, on my screen, I just insta-died.
[22:54.63]Nothing even happened.
[22:55.91]I just went like, eh.
[23:01.48]Look at these guys.
[23:05.75]What?
[23:06.35]What the hell was that?
[23:09.27]Nope.
[23:10.77]What just happened?
[23:11.74]Not me laughing.
[23:15.10]Oh, old YouTube, remember.
[23:17.08]If something remotely interesting just happened, slow it down and play it again.
[23:21.68]No.
[23:22.20]Where's my parachute?
[23:22.88]Where's my parachute?
[23:24.00]Good.
[23:24.36]Alright.
[23:25.22]So, meat.
[23:26.24]That thing is gonna kill a lot of people.
[23:28.97]I feel bad for whoever that lands on.
[23:31.13]What's with the, like, sad faces and shit?
[23:33.79]What am I doing?
[23:34.45]It's so scary.
[23:35.71]Who's it gonna land on?
[23:39.77]Alright.
[23:40.35]I'm parachuting down to the Empire State Building.
[23:42.43]Is that you right there?
[23:44.84]I don't think I'm gonna laugh that hard.
[23:45.97]Hey, what's up, stealth?
[23:47.89]Oh.
[23:48.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:49.99]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:50.89]No, this is not happening.
[23:51.69]You're not doing that.
[23:53.41]You're not doing this.
[23:55.35]I'm not even gonna be able to land on this thing.
[23:57.09]Oh, he's coming after me.
[23:58.07]That's what's going on.
[23:59.39]Stop shooting me, please.
[24:01.47]No, this is not gonna work!
[24:03.14]No!
[24:04.42]Before we do that, let's hope it works.
[24:06.36]I almost just fell off.
[24:08.81]Alright, boo.
[24:09.47]No laughing fit.
[24:10.52]In the video that's titled laughing fit.
[24:12.98]What are you doing?
[24:13.98]No, wrong way.
[24:14.70]I win.
[24:15.06]That was the wrong one again.
[24:17.06]What is this like?
[24:21.70]Alright, we're good.
[24:22.54]We're good.
[24:24.08]Five seconds.
[24:24.60]You better not shoot me off at the top of this.
[24:27.95]Oh my god, driving in sand.
[24:29.57]Yes!
[24:31.70]Okay, here's Hitman 3.
[24:34.06]Oh, look at the level this is.
[24:35.22]This is bad.
[24:36.26]Alright, we have to update the bingo board.
[24:39.10]Because... We had... We had something happen there.
[24:43.50]What was it?
[24:45.67]I'm gonna give you character voice, right?
[24:47.29]Because, I mean... Here comes the rant free space.
[24:52.75]Actually, let me put free space in now.
[24:57.89]Alright, so hold on.
[24:58.77]What are you guys looking for here?
[25:03.96]So, Vroomer and wrestling, that's, could happen very, I'll reset the timer, don't worry.
[25:08.24]Alright, let me see how, like, the path of where you can find the best.
[25:14.43]Okay, Vroomer might not happen.
[25:16.09]Wrestling might not happen.
[25:19.15]If you get laughing fit and you get rant, it's gonna be close.
[25:23.49]It'll be close.
[25:25.99]I really don't want to play this because this is like embarrassing because I get this is like actually like a part of this.
[25:30.69]This is a stream that I did where I was like pissed at when I turned it off.
[25:33.04]I was like, I fucking hated that stream.
[25:34.54]I fucking hated that game.
[25:35.98]Well, I love the Hitman 3, but this level.
[25:38.68]Well, I'm gonna, we're gonna do it.
[25:39.90]Should I veto it?
[25:40.60]I think I might veto it.
[25:42.26]I'm like actually, this is like the Surge 2.
[25:44.16]Like the Surge, right?
[25:47.02]Okay, here we go.
[25:47.82]Let's just go.
[25:49.00]Good luck.
[25:50.96]Hold on, let me group these together because...
[25:56.34]This is going to be a group.
[26:03.39]This is going to start to turn into hell if I don't do this.
[26:07.03]Okay, there we go.
[26:09.35]Alright, resetting timer and 3, 2, 1, let's go.
[26:11.49]I had to.
[26:30.49]Don't sell me the drugs right here.
[26:31.49]What are you stupid?
[26:33.17]Can I save it here?
[26:33.73]Okay.
[26:33.99]Thank God.
[26:35.67]You can listen to the tone of my voice.
[26:37.01]I'm already upset about something.
[26:38.53]Richard Nixon impression?
[26:39.47]Sure.
[26:41.04]It's already on there.
[26:46.16]It's already on there.
[26:50.48]In joke currency, fake money.
[26:52.30]Not real money.
[26:55.36]I'm so predictable.
[26:56.26]This is such a joke.
[27:01.95]Why does he drop it on the ground?
[27:05.64]You notice that?
[27:06.60]So give it to me.
[27:09.94]That's not one guy.
[27:11.06]No.
[27:13.08]Should I?
[27:17.88]You know, putting syringe on here wouldn't have been a bad idea.
[27:20.34]That's what I wanted to have happen last time.
[27:26.98]Get silent.
[27:29.59]Somebody will hear me if I stab him.
[27:33.14]Okay, I'm now the drug dealer.
[27:37.23]So now I have to walk up to one of these guys and sell drugs to him.
[27:41.81]I think we're missing the part where I go on the rant about it being a concrete level.
[27:46.69]Okay, which one of these guys does the drugs?
[27:48.54]Saved.
[27:48.84]Let's see if it's you.
[27:50.84]You were really high on this stream?
[27:52.90]No, I wasn't actually.
[27:53.94]I was lying to you.
[27:55.10]Because I didn't want people to think I was a moron.
[27:59.03]I was fucking probably stone cold sober on this stream.
[28:01.38]I said I was like high so people would think I wasn't like a moron.
[28:04.34]I have something for you, you might like.
[28:08.52]You think that, why wouldn't he, he should put on like a, like a... Ever since I started to tell you guys that I... 47 never puts a voice on.
[28:14.86]Its character voice is already there.
[28:15.71]Every time you disguise, he's just like, yes, I'm here, the chef, ready to serve you.
[28:20.99]You think if he was an assassin like that, why wouldn't you put a voice on?
[28:23.35]He's a liar.
[28:24.49]Put a voice on.
[28:27.05]Hey, would you like some drugs?
[28:30.74]Why do I have to just speak my normal voice?
[28:34.43]This guy doesn't want any drugs, I don't think.
[28:35.97]I just do so many voices.
[28:37.63]I'm probably so annoying to be at it for like a Thanksgiving dinner or like Christmas and shit.
[28:47.11]Like, at some point, I've never been recorded.
[28:50.19]And if I'm the most incredible assassin in the world, how do I... Nobody picked me up.
[28:55.88]I'm like a microphone in an office complex being like, the job is done.
[28:59.30]I just blew it.
[29:01.00]There we go.
[29:03.04]I got too close.
[29:03.58]I was talking.
[29:06.06]Not mad yet.
[29:08.83]Oh, that's right, when I shot that person.
[29:10.99]What is that?
[29:11.67]That's alright.
[29:12.77]That's not a rant.
[29:14.37]Order now.
[29:15.77]Oh, glue man!
[29:16.79]Well, I mean, you have like, you have like three weeks.
[29:19.81]Oh, shit, no.
[29:20.79]You can order in like three weeks if you want.
[29:23.80]This is wrestling.
[29:29.72]God damn it.
[29:30.42]Okay, hold on.
[29:32.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[29:36.12]Okay, so that's wrestling.
[29:43.42]Of course, the last three seconds of this fucking video.
[29:49.85]Vroom as well?
[29:50.81]When?
[29:51.97]There was not a vroom?
[29:52.83]What are you talking about?
[29:55.31]Got scared.
[30:06.22]You know, I've come to understand something about myself and about this stream.
[30:11.60]This is not a bingo card for things that have happened over the last 11 fucking straight years.
[30:18.94]These are things that happen every stream.
[30:25.02]Every single one.
[30:27.18]So besides maybe TF2 and maybe special event stream, this is just not a bingo card.
[30:35.81]This is just a checklist of things that I'm going to do every broadcast.
[30:43.61]You know what?
[30:44.15]Hold on.
[30:45.24]I want to watch the... Hold on.
[30:47.20]I want to watch this video.
[30:49.44]Pause the timer.
[30:52.81]I want to watch... This video is two minutes long.
[30:54.11]I just want to see this part.
[30:56.21]This is my first t-shirt ever.
[30:58.97]This doesn't count for anything.
[31:02.65]Yes, that's right.
[31:03.71]Glue Man, protector of the innocent, offender of justice, and warden of all that is good and kind, has finally caved into marketing pressure.
[31:12.38]It doesn't count to deliver this shirt to you.
[31:14.91]Buying this shirt will take you back to moments like these.
[31:18.35]Glue Man's Jerma Wrestling debut.
[31:21.01]As a 22-year-old newbie under the stage name G. Grossi, he made a real splash in his first match when he was nearly killed by Dogman, the magical dog magician, who at the time was considered at least partially blind.
[31:35.23]Each shirt does not come with a certificate of authenticity, but this might be what one may have looked like if they did.
[31:42.50]Signed and stamped by the father of all contemporary Jerma wrestling, George R. Glue Man Sr.
[31:48.60]himself.
[31:49.64]It is a true site of craftsmanship and quality.
[31:53.01]And again, no, you don't get one of these.
[31:56.27]How much does a t-shirt like this cost, you ask?
[31:59.61]Not $12,000.
[32:00.21]Not $8,000.
[32:01.14]Not even $5,000.
[32:01.84]That's a tired joke, but I still think it's funny.
[32:05.46]To get your very own Glue Man t-shirt, you need only one low payment of $20.
[32:12.16]Plus shipping and handling.
[32:13.12]That's not a spill joke.
[32:13.90]Take pride in owning a piece of Jerma Channel history.
[32:17.11]brag to all of your friends that you own a shirt whose depicted character has been deemed out loud as the worst character ever and useless by the individual who created him.
[32:28.24]These shirts are only available for a limited time and may never be available again.
[32:32.71]Yeah, they are.
[32:33.23]Head over to teespring.com slash glue man to reserve one today.
[32:37.93]All links will be in the description.
[32:39.76]Yeah, they're available.
[32:43.84]June 2015.
[32:45.38]Holy shit.
[32:46.02]That's a long time ago.
[32:47.22]What a lie.
[32:47.82]Well, I said they may... They weren't.
[32:50.90]From 2015 to like 2019.
[32:54.99]This shirt was gone.
[32:55.85]You could not buy it.
[32:59.09]You're old.
[32:59.55]Yeah, I know.
[33:00.57]Welcome to how old I am.
[33:03.47]Alright, you ready?
[33:03.99]Let's keep going.
[33:04.41]I just want to see that.
[33:05.31]I haven't seen that video in like six years or something.
[33:10.84]Where do we stand?
[33:13.73]Alright.
[33:15.05]A rumor ends this whole thing for me.
[33:16.97]Well, not really, but, you know, we keep going.
[33:21.27]Alright, let's go.
[33:22.95]Gonna start the timer back.
[33:24.77]Continue to go through the ages.
[33:27.65]Here we go.
[33:33.83]Oh shit, hold on.
[33:36.45]This is just the timer settings.
[33:41.97]Oops.
[33:43.54]How did I mess this up?
[33:45.78]How did I mess this up?
[33:46.44]What the fuck?
[33:52.79]Oh, there we go.
[33:53.19]Okay.
[33:54.03]Oops.
[33:56.85]Streaming the Nintendo- I gotta turn the camera off.
[34:03.10]Yeah, it's gonna be every single character.
[34:05.20]There's Bayonetta.
[34:10.00]I'm not on cam yet, though.
[34:13.32]It's a special event?
[34:15.38]No, it's not.
[34:16.02]This is 54, 50, this is like 60, 62 characters.
[34:19.88]This is not a special event.
[34:21.37]They do one of these every fucking 30 days.
[34:23.55]That's not a special event.
[34:29.11]Is this E3?
[34:33.31]You're going back down.
[34:34.40]I'm telling you, if I see Glover, I swear to God.
[34:37.88]They should have added Glover.
[34:38.86]I'll stand by that.
[34:40.38]Is it?
[34:41.06]God damn it.
[34:41.58]Fine.
[34:41.92]It's a special event.
[34:42.66]It is.
[34:44.18]Oh, here comes Gex.
[34:45.64]It's E3.
[34:48.08]All three Battletoads.
[34:52.11]Which E3 2018?
[34:54.73]God damn it.
[34:56.15]Yeah, okay.
[34:57.09]That's not just like a Nintendo Direct.
[34:59.17]This is like E3.
[35:03.59]What's the announcement, though, I wonder?
[35:04.77]Did they just unconfirm Luigi by putting him in an egg for eternity?
[35:10.99]That's not funny.
[35:12.45]What about the big reveal?
[35:13.83]Who's the new character?
[35:15.19]Who did they reveal in 2018?
[35:16.09]They're going to show him.
[35:17.15]They're going to zoom in on his face.
[35:19.89]There he is.
[35:25.78]That's right.
[35:26.76]Every fighter in Super Smash Bros.
[35:28.56]history is joining the battle.
[35:31.12]People are gonna think I'm, like, one of these weird Twitch channels that just streams random, like, TV shows and events and stuff.
[35:37.47]Like, why is this channel streaming?
[35:38.77]The 2018 E3.
[35:39.37]I'm not vetoing it with 60 seconds left.
[35:40.97]This is fine.
[35:41.45]He said it.
[35:57.92]Even so, your starting roster may be as small as the original Nintendo 64 game.
[36:04.27]No new characters?
[36:07.09]I want to know what I have to say about this though.
[36:10.71]I feel like I have a really shit take on this.
[36:13.77]Eight player battles are also making a return.
[36:17.23]See what happens when you pit many different fighters against one another.
[36:21.27]Most unbalanced video game.
[36:23.92]What exactly is this screen?
[36:24.54]It's me watching 4,000 hours of videos that I've ever made.
[36:26.52]You know what I mean.
[36:27.26]Do you have shit takes on everything?
[36:28.48]No, I don't.
[36:28.78]What about what I said about peanut butter?
[36:45.86]Link dons his champion's tunic from The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[36:50.08]His bombs are now remotely detonated.
[36:53.46]And his final smash- Where are we going?
[36:56.58]So, they still haven't fixed this, because I've tried to go back to DirectX 9 before.
[37:01.29]Right before I was going to do these commentaries, I tried it, and it still didn't work.
[37:05.21]I still was getting terrible frames per second.
[37:07.37]I've tried everything, so don't leave a comment telling me to change my video drivers or something, because I've already done it.
[37:15.87]So I come up behind this heavy, get him with a backstab.
[37:18.81]I want to talk about another tip.
[37:21.29]Look at what I have equipped right now as my disguise as a medic.
[37:24.88]I'm using the Bonesaw right now.
[37:26.76]You can switch what weapon you're holding in the disguise if you hit B while you're holding your different weapons.
[37:33.02]Too many spies walk around if they're disguised.
[37:35.20]Let's just say you're disguised as the medic, right?
[37:38.20]If you're walking around with a syringe gun out as the medic, as your disguise, people are going to know you're a spy because what medic walks around with a syringe gun when there's no enemies around?
[37:48.15]Exactly.
[37:48.99]So make sure you're aware of the different items that people are holding.
[37:51.53]But make sure you can face-stab people.
[37:54.45]So me and this sniper are going toe-to-toe.
[37:56.15]He covers me with the GR-Roddy.
[37:57.73]No, actually, what happened was, you fucked up, and somehow you killed that guy.
[38:02.58]And this revolver is really, really fun to use.
[38:04.34]It's really, really powerful.
[38:06.06]The whole point for me coming back here was to take out the teleporter.
[38:08.80]I figured it was going to take too long for the sapper, and I was right, because look at these people coming out to try and get me.
[38:14.00]I get away with my life intact, and I decloak right behind this rock.
[38:18.04]Like I told you before, this place is fantastic for decloaking, because look, nobody seems to know or care.
[38:24.35]So I'm following this line of people and this is where the Dead Ringer shines as you'll see in the next second or two here.
[38:31.52]get this engineer, get the sentry gun, pull out the Dead Ringer, run behind everybody, you know you're just gonna die, just use it, don't be afraid to take this thing out, get behind every single person again, make sure you don't be close right next to somebody, and you'll hear it, come right back up with the way I came originally, and we're gonna do it all over again.
[38:50.88]This time I get about three or four kills in a row, I get this engineer,
[38:55.03]Of course this is going to be outdated info.
[38:57.03]And the heavy he was healing.
[38:59.25]Pull it out.
[38:59.93]Rinse and repeat again.
[39:02.07]That's the best part about the Dead Ringer is if you have a set route, pretty much plan out a route you're going to take and just do it every single time.
[39:10.85]People are very, very ignorant to Dead Ringer spies.
[39:14.31]They never check and they always lose their ground whenever they're looking for you.
[39:17.93]So I get that sniper, I get this scout, pull the Dead Ringer out, we turn around, and we try and do it again.
[39:24.74]This engineer knows I'm around, he's starting to wise up a little bit to Dead Ringer spy, which is me.
[39:30.60]Cloak right behind these rocks, because it's awesome.
[39:35.00]Come up here, I try to jump and get that sentry, it doesn't work, it's too far away.
[39:38.60]And right here is a completely and totally horribly embarrassing thing.
[39:43.45]I gotta be right back.
[39:44.87]I actually have to be right back.
[39:45.77]I swear to God, I'm not kidding.
[39:47.91]I'll be right back.
[39:48.61]Just one second.
[39:56.55]I gotta clean this up before it stains.
[40:20.21]I'm not even muted, whoops.
[41:41.84]Alright, it's coming up.
[41:43.42]It's coming up.
[41:44.32]Just give me another minute.
[41:45.82]I think I'm okay.
[41:47.18]It's coming up. ...
[43:27.79]God damn it.
[43:28.87]I've been so good about keeping this area so clean that I dump a fucking coffee on the ground!
[43:35.78]Oh, I'm fine.
[43:40.78]Swinging a spy around, mocking my past self.
[43:44.96]It's like... Alright, wait, let's go.
[43:55.24]Okay, let's go.
[43:57.94]Finish the stream.
[43:58.67]Hurry up.
[43:59.09]I want to play Terraria.
[44:01.39]You just put me in a tab, man.
[44:02.81]That's alright.
[44:05.41]Just put me in a tab.
[44:06.09]Alright, we got to update the bingo card.
[44:15.28]Which... Goodness, okay.
[44:17.82]We have some new additions.
[44:23.67]TF2...
[44:26.58]This is actually filling up Jex too?
[44:31.31]Really?
[44:33.39]Because I got like three, four kills in a row?
[44:36.61]Alright, I guess that makes sense.
[44:43.45]Yeah, no, like, okay, getting three backstabs in a row as Spy in 2011...
[44:49.84]I mean, okay, this is important too.
[44:52.79]This was right after they changed the knife to be instant instead of it taking a full second to swing.
[44:58.35]That's not a Jex moment.
[45:00.85]Yeah, I disagree.
[45:03.12]I disagree.
[45:05.24]Right after this changed back in like 2010, 2011, Spy was insane for like a month or two straight because nobody was used to the fact that it took less than a second to stab somebody in the back.
[45:18.87]But I will give you the special event.
[45:20.57]Oh, no.
[45:22.93]I just have to... By the way, this doesn't count.
[45:25.43]I'm just giving you a reference.
[45:27.42]When I say something like, MonkaS.
[45:30.12]Or like, oh, PogChamp!
[45:31.40]Like, yeah, that... This is going to end pretty quickly, I think.
[45:34.22]Alright.
[45:37.96]Let's get the timer back here.
[45:38.80]And continue.
[45:51.21]In three, two, one, we move.
[45:54.05]Like five people, guaranteed if he has more than a few shots.
[45:57.71]And he can land them.
[45:59.15]Far too often I'll see engineers standing by their sentry guns with a glowing bright shotgun, just doing nothing.
[46:07.10]I feel like if you start to heal those people and tell them over mic, hey, how many revenge crits do you have?
[46:12.44]Oh, I got 17.
[46:15.08]Hey, you want to go kill the whole team right now?
[46:17.17]It's like a no-brainer.
[46:19.11]I have five videos.
[46:20.43]That was me building the sentry gun, and it took about 30 seconds maybe.
[46:24.35]Nothing happened.
[46:24.85]I didn't die.
[46:25.41]It was just really boring, so I didn't want to have you guys have to sit through that.
[46:29.32]But killing that sniper right there, people freak out.
[46:31.96]I've said this before in other gameplay commentaries, that when you get hit by a crit, when you get shot in the stomach by a crit, whether it's a rocket, whether it's a shotgun, doesn't matter.
[46:40.91]You freak out a little bit, and you go, okay, there's crits, I gotta run by.
[46:44.31]Oh, by the way, one shot kill right there.
[46:46.93]You sound like an asshole.
[46:47.73]You guys know what I mean, right?
[46:49.07]When you see a crit screen, when a medic pops a crit screen on somebody, and their weapons are glowing...
[46:54.42]You immediately go, here comes crits, I'm gonna die.
[46:59.08]The same thing can be said about somebody that has a frontier justice that's glowing.
[47:03.18]Even when I'm not playing Engineer, I could be playing Soldier, or I could be playing Spy, and if I see the glowing shotgun, I go, oh shit.
[47:13.49]And I either back up, or I go for another target.
[47:16.13]That's what goes through everybody's mind.
[47:18.77]So this is the second century that's built to completion now.
[47:21.53]Get a few kills.
[47:22.31]That spy was definitely a Dead Ringer.
[47:24.38]You can always tell when a spy's a Dead Ringer when you shoot them one time from far away, and it does two damage, but it magically kills them.
[47:31.32]So Dead Ringer spies, I do that too, though.
[47:33.56]Everybody does that.
[47:34.40]Look at how messed up my hair is.
[47:35.76]So I got four kills on this sentry, and I kind of do something really, really outrageous.
[47:40.93]And these are tips.
[47:41.87]And not recommended to most people that are playing Engineer, because we have this one point, we only have three minutes to go, and I destroy the sentry to get the crits.
[47:52.64]I'm such a greedy bastard.
[47:54.04]No, that's not a bad idea.
[47:55.54]Oh, this is a good idea.
[47:56.44]Yeah, let me just destroy the sentry.
[47:58.10]You build it immediately.
[47:58.72]But if you're quick enough...
[47:59.78]If you can get a sentry built back to completion pretty quickly, especially when I have that dispenser right there, a full level 3 dispenser, I'm not worried about it at all.
[48:08.65]Right now, I'm just curious.
[48:09.73]I want to try and look around, try and get some more kills.
[48:11.95]Soldier right in his face, 180 damage.
[48:14.09]Remember how I said that before, 180.
[48:17.07]looking around, perusing, seeing if I can get a shot on somebody, get a kill.
[48:20.46]I miss a few times, but I get the kill on him anyways from long-range crit.
[48:24.28]Guys, don't be afraid to do this.
[48:26.60]If you're afraid to do this, if you think you need to stand by your sentry at all times and guard it with your life, I mean, that's true, but it's not true enough where you can't go have a little bit of fun.
[48:36.99]Remember, a spy is going to try and backstab you and take out your sentry and all your buildings.
[48:42.56]So what happens if a spy just saps all that stuff right now?
[48:45.52]The map is small enough where I'm gonna be able to get back to at least one or two of my buildings, preferably the dispenser, or maybe even the sentry.
[48:52.86]It's really not a- Okay, where are we going?
[48:54.06]Go, go, go.
[48:54.60]I need to, like, feed this guy drugs so he doesn't die.
[48:58.11]Surgeon simulator.
[48:59.21]Almost, almost!
[49:00.97]No, come on!
[49:01.91]Alright, where's the syringe?
[49:05.59]Where- there it is, there it is, come here!
[49:06.63]Yes, I played the funny YouTuber games when they came out.
[49:12.33]Yes!
[49:13.78]Yes.
[49:14.82]We're good.
[49:15.40]We are good.
[49:16.92]Just need to cool it here.
[49:18.30]I'm vetoing this.
[49:19.50]Don't want to lose the hearts right here.
[49:21.76]You already know what this whole video is.
[49:24.26]Protect the heart for the time being.
[49:26.72]Okay, the doors are closed.
[49:28.88]Veto.
[49:29.70]I don't think anybody's gonna do this.
[49:33.34]I think I just wasted like two hours of my time.
[49:36.57]Would you do it?
[49:37.25]I would never do this.
[49:38.19]This video is awesome, actually.
[49:40.76]Except for this guy.
[49:41.86]Except for this guy.
[49:43.58]Please be the only brainless motherfucker in here that's gonna do this.
[49:46.15]Watch this shit.
[49:46.89]He's doing it.
[49:47.49]He's doing it.
[49:48.19]Follow him down.
[49:49.93]Oh!
[49:50.39]He's gonna crash into people!
[49:52.89]Is... Is he alive?
[49:55.67]Did he make it into the pool?
[49:57.39]This video was a lot fun to make.
[49:58.23]He made it in the pool!
[50:00.13]It's safe.
[50:00.69]It works.
[50:04.55]Come on.
[50:05.35]Let's go.
[50:06.05]Fall joke?
[50:10.27]Yeah.
[50:10.45]I gotta get a good view of this.
[50:11.99]It's already there, though.
[50:12.95]This is too long sitting here waiting for this.
[50:14.55]Here we go.
[50:14.89]Let's see what he does.
[50:16.73]See ya!
[50:17.53]Oh, God!
[50:21.42]Oh, he made it.
[50:22.10]He made it.
[50:24.06]Yeah, and Kevin MacLeod music.
[50:26.60]Ta-da!
[50:28.16]We all used it, man.
[50:29.32]Anybody else?
[50:30.53]Anybody else?
[50:32.55]Pause it.
[50:33.67]See, he is about to jump off this high dive right now.
[50:37.24]And he thinks he's going in the pool.
[50:40.22]Well, what we're gonna do is we're going to replace... Let's replace part of this pool that he's about to dive into with, you know, just, you know, just like that.
[50:50.77]Let's just see what happens.
[50:53.35]Let's see what happens to this guy.
[50:58.45]Oh, don't tell me you wouldn't do it either.
[51:00.35]Yeah, you would do the same thing.
[51:02.41]There he goes.
[51:07.46]He landed!
[51:07.88]What?!
[51:10.30]Where- it's this kid right here!
[51:11.44]He landed.
[51:13.56]Are you serious?!
[51:15.80]You're completely fine after that?!
[51:17.85]I'm not hungry.
[51:18.61]Here you go!
[51:21.15]He's fine!
[51:24.25]All he has to say is, I'm hungry coming through.
[51:27.95]Beach Hut was really good value.
[51:30.37]I'm not that hungry right now.
[51:32.01]He's shocked by his own video.
[51:33.09]You just jumped off of a 5,000 foot platform into the ground.
[51:38.01]And you got right, what are you, fucking Spider-Man?
[51:40.26]I made this video like nine years ago.
[51:41.88]I don't remember.
[51:44.32]Oh shit, we're at the end.
[51:44.90]That was a good one, I liked that one.
[51:46.90]Alright, the timer doesn't matter for this one.
[51:51.12]Alright, are we good?
[51:51.94]Are we updated?
[51:57.34]Yeah, we're up, dude.
[51:58.86]No bingo yet.
[52:01.52]Mm-mm.
[52:03.34]You'll know when it's actually rant.
[52:05.66]You'll know.
[52:06.74]We won't even have to have an argument.
[52:07.98]We won't even have to talk about it.
[52:10.14]It'll be so, so obvious.
[52:15.22]Alright, let me, uh... Let's go.
[52:16.76]You ready?
[52:18.28]Get the timer reset.
[52:20.38]And let's go.
[52:20.80]Uh... Okay.
[52:25.33]Okay.
[52:28.76]The end of this video?
[52:29.78]The last one second?
[52:34.62]Okay, let's keep going.
[52:39.28]Year one almost done.
[52:43.52]This is a Stardew Valley stream.
[52:46.19]Or tonight.
[52:46.59]I'm just gonna make a couple more planets.
[52:49.15]Holy shit, this is old.
[52:50.27]I can't believe I'm actually doing that, by the way.
[52:59.93]Veto?
[53:00.91]Why?
[53:02.97]These Batwings sell for a lot, if I remember correctly.
[53:06.52]I'm not wasting a Veto.
[53:08.20]I already have four Vetos left.
[53:10.04]Why am I going to waste a Veto on this?
[53:13.80]Oh, God.
[53:14.48]I don't care how boring this part is.
[53:16.86]I'm not wasting a Veto.
[53:19.66]We have a Veto.
[53:20.76]You're going to have to vote for that.
[53:24.44]You have to vote for it.
[53:26.58]Jeez.
[53:30.40]I hate these little dust mites.
[53:31.44]They're the worst.
[53:33.92]They're too erratic.
[53:35.38]This stream sucks.
[53:36.10]Hey, Stardew Valley is like where I started, okay?
[53:38.46]On like streaming.
[53:39.86]On Twitch.
[53:40.24]Do I have any more food?
[53:44.89]Eat this.
[53:45.25]I'm gonna have to go down here and stand.
[53:49.73]This is like one of the best video games ever made.
[53:51.23]You believe me?
[53:51.73]It's a fishing pole.
[53:53.49]You scared the shit out of me.
[53:54.45]I thought something happened to me.
[53:56.86]Why did I have that selected?
[54:02.57]What a fun game.
[54:04.11]I love... Boring Andy.
[54:06.93]Look, you do understand it's everything.
[54:09.49]We could get me sitting there.
[54:12.49]You could get like the credits of a stream and I would have to stay there.
[54:16.92]You might get like the end credits of a random stream.
[54:20.50]It's very possible.
[54:21.24]But truth be told, this is the most enemies I think I've seen in the game so far in one room.
[54:25.50]Whoa.
[54:26.76]We got a veto?
[54:27.58]Dwarf scroll two.
[54:28.44]I already got dwarf scroll three.
[54:31.39]That's a worse version of the spell that I heard.
[54:33.00]No, look at all these no's.
[54:34.36]I ain't going anywhere.
[54:37.34]Look at all these no's.
[54:40.38]That one looks different.
[54:42.07]Is it gonna explode?
[54:46.11]You know what I mean?
[54:46.75]Look, he's doing the thing that all enemies do right before they blow up.
[54:49.21]There's 50 seconds left.
[54:50.71]We're gonna take that long.
[54:57.61]It's so weird, like, just looking into, like, a weird telescope into the past.
[55:01.15]It's weird.
[55:03.67]How come my voice got higher?
[55:04.85]Can something please be better than my broken trident?
[55:07.65]New microphone, and I aged 10 years.
[55:09.29]I think the speed is cool.
[55:10.87]I want to see what it looks like.
[55:11.77]You know, this weird thing happens when you get older.
[55:13.98]Your body changes.
[55:16.10]You don't stay, like, 25 for your entire life.
[55:18.30]This is a stab.
[55:19.90]You age a little.
[55:21.10]Your vocal cords get a little different.
[55:22.74]You get a little gravelly.
[55:24.64]Your microphone settings might change.
[55:29.44]Did I say +2 speed?
[55:30.42]Is that actually making me faster?
[55:32.89]I can't even tell.
[55:33.87]Where are we going?
[55:35.97]Where are we going?
[55:39.95]Casino Inc.
[55:40.65]Part 2.
[55:42.45]This is a banger.
[55:43.25]I know that for a fact.
[55:56.93]Storm, storm the Pasta Italiano.
[56:01.89]Okay, guys.
[56:05.00]Oh, this part.
[56:06.66]To Pasta Italiano!
[56:08.64]They all go and start like a war at the restaurant.
[56:15.50]This game is so good.
[56:17.85]We gotta corner the chef market.
[56:20.15]This game, this was the funnest thing I've ever done.
[56:24.28]You need to extend the time for this one.
[56:25.80]Because then I'll be the only restaurant.
[56:34.03]No, no.
[56:34.45]The casino games are there, but I'm not playing them.
[56:36.07]It's a heavily guarded fortress.
[56:38.83]This is an RTS now.
[56:46.74]Why is somebody on the ground?
[56:49.58]You're hit, man.
[56:50.18]Okay.
[56:50.34]This is top tier.
[56:50.94]This... Okay.
[56:53.99]This was nominated for like best streams of the year last year, right?
[56:58.01]People loved this.
[56:58.89]I did too.
[57:03.42]Oh, they're all in.
[57:04.54]Okay, wait, maybe we should extend.
[57:05.76]Okay, let's extend this.
[57:07.08]This part's insane.
[57:08.48]You're Hitman.
[57:09.60]Everybody's here.
[57:12.28]Peter Baldwin.
[57:14.38]Mr. Hoffman.
[57:15.82]Mr. Nolt.
[57:17.14]Mr. Bingham.
[57:20.58]Paul Strebling.
[57:22.50]There's so many people here.
[57:23.90]There's so many people here.
[57:25.88]Madison!
[57:33.56]Doesn't somebody like just start attacking?
[57:34.96]Just all stand over here.
[57:41.44]They like burn this place down like five times, don't they?
[57:44.10]Without me doing anything.
[57:52.96]Oh, who cares?
[57:54.61]I don't care about anything right now.
[57:57.59]Besides... Wait, I think they're getting keen on this.
[58:01.87]Oh, they have a security guard there, right?
[58:05.23]One of your staff has died.
[58:06.41]Alright, who's going to take the shot?
[58:09.49]Who's going to make the first shot here?
[58:10.53]I remember just being in a different room or something and just hearing that through the microphone.
[58:16.80]It's just like, what the fuck is going on?
[58:19.18]Alright, Mr. Jurgens.
[58:22.09]Mr. Jurgens.
[58:23.91]It's all hitmen.
[58:24.86]Oh yeah, we were taken out their restaurant.
[58:26.48]Chef Bako is in your sights.
[58:33.16]Mr. Jurgens.
[58:36.59]Fire.
[58:37.19]Good.
[58:38.81]Oh my god.
[58:39.67]They're all... What just happened?
[58:42.27]What happened?
[58:53.70]How many am I putting down?
[58:55.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:56.24]Oof.
[58:56.48]Oh, wait.
[58:57.04]Counter-strike.
[58:58.64]Oh, my.
[58:58.84]No, no, don't.
[58:59.56]Don't.
[58:59.86]I want a raise.
[59:07.05]I want a raise.
[59:24.20]By the way, this is like, if you've never played Casino Inc.
[59:28.14]Get out!
[59:28.94]This is like one of the best games ever made.
[59:31.66]It's so fun.
[59:32.64]It's so much fun.
[59:33.52]It's the most absurd fucking game ever.
[59:37.22]No, no more hitmen!
[59:39.05]Stop coming in!
[59:41.57]That laughing fit?
[59:42.37]Oh my god.
[59:42.99]Okay, if a chef walks out that fucking door.
[59:45.47]If a chef comes out that door, then this place is owned by a trillionaire.
[59:51.39]Doesn't even matter.
[59:53.70]Not quite.
[59:56.76]If a fucking chef opens this door.
[60:00.58]Does it happen?
[60:01.35]I don't remember.
[60:01.83]Can we extend to find out?
[60:06.89]I'm curious.
[60:21.00]Oh no, they all just go in the elevator, right?
[60:25.47]So many people in that elevator.
[60:32.69]Extend?
[60:33.25]No, no, we're not just gonna extend this one over and over again.
[60:41.26]We have, we have 170 days straight, 24 hour periods of videos to see, so.
[60:58.30]What was this guy doing?
[61:05.18]Alright, we're going.
[61:05.90]Let's go.
[61:06.40]Let's go.
[61:06.68]Come on.
[61:06.96]Come on.
[61:22.86]There it is.
[61:24.08]There it is.
[61:25.82]What is this?
[61:27.40]What is it?
[61:29.96]What's happening?
[61:31.11]What's happening?
[61:32.99]Retaliation.
[61:36.81]It was the old guy.
[61:38.31]I forgot about this.
[61:39.01]What the fuck is this?
[61:41.83]Oh.
[61:48.24]He took like seven shots.
[61:54.63]I'll include it.
[61:58.39]Alright, alright, alright.
[62:06.19]They burnt the place down again.
[62:09.64]Remember, I just attacked this place.
[62:12.44]And then they got back to normal, and then they started a fire again.
[62:14.80]For those of you that didn't see this stream, this restaurant was on fire two days a week.
[62:20.14]They burnt this place down two days a week.
[62:21.32]It was fucking ridiculous.
[62:23.86]Okay, I need to fucking relax.
[62:27.17]Alright.
[62:28.05]Why is it he just walked in?
[62:31.31]Alright.
[62:31.59]He just walked in.
[62:32.29]I'll give it to you.
[62:33.55]Who was the old guy that was shooting people in my new family-friendly place?
[62:42.14]No!
[62:43.50]It can't be!
[62:44.80]It can't be!
[62:45.78]Okay.
[62:45.92]So that is... This is not bingo, right?
[62:47.60]No!
[62:48.12]I don't think so.
[62:49.01]Not yet.
[62:49.29]Where's the laughing fit?
[62:54.35]God damn it!
[62:55.37]You're getting close.
[62:56.33]You're getting really close.
[62:57.51]Fucking God!
[63:02.53]Naked.
[63:03.45]Of rumor.
[63:04.21]Saying an emote out loud.
[63:05.43]I just get, like, in my ear.
[63:07.09]Like, I can only get text.
[63:09.38]Oh, one of your staff is dead.
[63:11.68]What?
[63:12.72]What are you talking about?
[63:14.14]Excuse me?
[63:14.72]Oh, one of your staff is dead again.
[63:17.16]What?
[63:18.18]Gambling?
[63:18.64]No, no.
[63:19.54]I have to gamble.
[63:20.42]It's not gambling on the screen.
[63:22.92]It's me gambling.
[63:24.30]Different.
[63:26.00]Alright, let's go.
[63:30.28]Razor death adder.
[63:32.00]Wrestling.
[63:36.44]And here comes next.
[63:37.48]Already on there.
[63:38.82]Next is number 12, almost to the halfway point.
[63:41.02]What year is this?
[63:42.04]Oh, Jerma's short.
[63:43.70]2K18.
[63:44.38]No, it gets clotheslined, not over the top ropes, but just barely into the ropes.
[63:47.81]Oh, this is like the chat meme rumble, right?
[63:50.29]Still two planets in here.
[63:52.53]And remember, the planets are in here just to make this more difficult for the shit memes.
[63:56.33]Remember.
[63:56.63]Yeah, alright, this is the meme one.
[63:57.61]It's really important to remember.
[64:00.08]If a planet wins, and there you go, laughing about it a little bit, just a small amount, just eliminated Jerma Jupiter.
[64:06.02]Who is this?
[64:06.68]Who is this?
[64:07.08]It gets that much easier for one of these shit memes to stay alive.
[64:12.07]Who's the guy with the green hat?
[64:14.51]At number 13.
[64:17.73]I didn't say an emote.
[64:18.59]Who's still in it?
[64:19.85]Who still could be in it?
[64:21.47]What emote?
[64:21.91]What are you talking about?
[64:23.09]No, I didn't.
[64:23.85]What did I say?
[64:26.02]Jerma short, maybe persevere through this whole thing.
[64:28.18]Jerma late.
[64:29.72]Oh, what the fuck?
[64:30.24]Could stay in it and persevere through the whole thing.
[64:33.52]Or could he just get eliminated by himself?
[64:35.88]I'm going to play semantics here with you.
[64:37.56]And there goes jermaSaturn.
[64:38.76]The planets are gone.
[64:40.70]There are only, I believe, two more planets.
[64:44.01]Never mind.
[64:45.19]Jerma getting as far up on the ropes as he can, like I said previously.
[64:47.97]And Jerma laid his mic and nexted here.
[64:50.67]He does not.
[64:52.63]No, that's not true.
[64:54.45]He's got a huge, gross foot in his mouth.
[64:57.15]Okay.
[64:57.91]Stops it pre.
[64:58.93]No, no, no, no, no.
[64:59.65]Is he gonna reverse it now?
[65:00.65]He spins him around.
[65:01.57]That's 100 subs.
[65:02.71]Big belly to back suplex.
[65:03.73]Stick around.
[65:04.33]I'm doing it at the end of the stream.
[65:06.40]Somebody saved the planet.
[65:07.94]Piledriver, that move is illegal.
[65:10.34]Bingo.
[65:10.96]Jerma just did a move that has been banned since 2002.
[65:13.36]You understand?
[65:16.28]That's how fucked up and angry and desperate he is.
[65:19.38]Fine, it counts.
[65:21.38]Loud P coming in at 14.
[65:23.92]I'm not vetoing.
[65:24.82]It's only 60 seconds.
[65:25.57]Come on.
[65:28.44]I think a lot of people want to see Loud Peace survive.
[65:30.08]I don't think we're going to fill the whole board, though.
[65:33.22]Actually, I could do with any of these.
[65:35.89]Except for short, Jerma.
[65:37.51]And next.
[65:38.87]These characters are so fucked up looking.
[65:40.89]Oh, my God.
[65:41.63]The countdown.
[65:44.59]The face is still not in here.
[65:46.81]Spread across the right side of the face.
[65:48.27]Sensor bar was in here first, right?
[65:51.72]Here comes Acid Face.
[65:52.56]Overall, it's possible.
[65:53.38]It's possible.
[65:53.92]Just pretend it's here.
[65:54.58]There's still another two hours left, at least.
[65:56.74]Oh, I gotta do it.
[65:58.25]Fine.
[66:00.41]There's no music shit, right?
[66:01.53]I gotta do it.
[66:02.03]You gotta do the music.
[66:07.09]Again, I want to reiterate to people that may have just... Oh, there goes Next!
[66:09.91]Next is gone.
[66:10.21]...that just got here or that don't know what the hell we're doing.
[66:12.27]Thank goodness.
[66:13.15]This is a website that is set up to randomly play a video and a random timestamp... That was loud.
[66:18.67]...of every broadcast and every video I've ever done.
[66:20.89]He's got the speaker in his ass.
[66:22.67]Next is gone.
[66:23.82]It's 4,100 hours.
[66:24.46]Get it out of your system now because it's not going to be there today.
[66:26.20]We could get anything.
[66:27.68]Extend now.
[66:28.28]Here comes the censor bar.
[66:29.88]At number 16.
[66:30.16]Where are we going?
[66:32.24]Dark Souls Remastered Part 8 Bonus.
[66:38.57]This is where I need to remember again.
[66:40.11]It's the... You go up.
[66:44.55]Through the... Is this going to the tree?
[66:47.77]Oh, this is going to be some massive anger.
[66:51.93]Water wheel, whatever the hell it is, right?
[66:56.55]I sound really deflated here.
[66:57.87]Oh, fuck.
[67:02.57]I don't have the thing.
[67:03.53]This is Blighttown.
[67:04.59]You got a really good possibility for a rant here.
[67:10.35]I don't have the thing.
[67:11.49]Yeah, I gotta go this way.
[67:16.17]You died to pinwheel.
[67:19.57]The old sub sub.
[67:20.11]Do you play PvP?
[67:20.85]Uh, this is PvP.
[67:21.92]PvP and multiplayer.
[67:24.38]Just kind of messing around in multiplayer.
[67:26.02]What?
[67:28.56]When did I- I did that?
[67:32.48]Who did I PvP?
[67:39.30]This is remastered.
[67:40.80]Dark Souls Remastered.
[67:42.24]So this is like the last... I'm trying to wonder where this would fit.
[67:47.00]I just know it will, so...
[67:54.52]Alright, now from here I gotta go up.
[67:55.74]That's the origin of the sub sound.
[67:58.02]That's from Monster Rancher.
[68:00.74]That is one of the sounds a monster makes.
[68:03.24]And everyone thought it was really funny because it sounded like Tim the Tool Man.
[68:08.71]That was kind of funny.
[68:16.55]It just became the sub sound for like three or four years.
[68:20.48]We'll close it up.
[68:22.36]It's not me?
[68:22.84]No, it's not me.
[68:27.13]Wait, you guys thought that was me?
[68:29.17]See how many people can... Red phantoms only.
[68:32.43]Pull them all in.
[68:34.27]No.
[68:35.64]That's a sound file from Monster Rancher.
[68:38.72]I gotta keep going up.
[68:40.18]Right?
[68:40.58]Keep going up.
[68:47.75]I think we're safe on this one.
[68:48.91]This is just me walking around and boringly filling dead air.
[68:51.69]It's perfect.
[68:55.44]Perfect for you guys to not get another bingo.
[68:56.77]That's how you go to get the... the soul, but I don't even really want it.
[69:00.71]I'm really surprised we have not seen an end of the stream bit reading.
[69:06.77]Why are my feet yellow?
[69:07.77]Because the whole character's yellow.
[69:12.22]That's kind of actually surprising.
[69:19.99]Up one more.
[69:21.05]Is this a 12 year old Let's Play of Dark Souls?
[69:23.29]No, this actually is a probably two year old Let's Play of Dark Souls.
[69:26.17]This is the remaster.
[69:27.52]Again.
[69:27.96]I am completely lost.
[69:33.16]There's no way I'm getting out of this.
[69:36.82]We did that very silently.
[69:38.30]We all knew.
[69:39.00]You dicks.
[69:40.00]This is an old one.
[69:40.66]It's just me and this weird hermit guy back here now.
[69:46.93]I like this video.
[69:48.45]I'm fighting through.
[69:49.65]He's bringing rats.
[69:53.41]Too bad rats is not one.
[69:54.63]Is it?
[69:55.01]We're doing it.
[69:55.65]Also, we're wearing bandanas and look like pirates.
[70:00.30]Okay.
[70:00.92]Star, you're not allowed to look.
[70:03.10]Not allowed to look?
[70:03.98]No, because you're the burger judge.
[70:05.32]There's people coming in.
[70:06.30]There's customers.
[70:07.76]I'll talk the people down.
[70:08.60]You gotta show them to their seats.
[70:10.00]I'll lower their expectations.
[70:11.63]Lower their expectations, because they're going to probably throw up after eating one of our burgers.
[70:15.54]I wonder, did it get to the part where it was- where's this in the video?
[70:17.34]That's pretty far in.
[70:17.84]Oh, I picked something up.
[70:18.68]Hold on.
[70:18.94]Yeah, still, we have to make burgers.
[70:20.24]We have to make our own delicious cheeseburgers.
[70:22.34]By second rule.
[70:22.98]Alright, so- By second rule.
[70:24.82]Start with the bun.
[70:26.08]And, hey, I have- Everyone get away from each other, because we're just going to knock into stuff.
[70:30.32]I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.
[70:32.78]This game was so fun.
[70:33.96]I missed this show.
[70:34.65]My burger station is going to be right next to the sink.
[70:38.51]In the bathroom.
[70:39.61]Yeah.
[70:40.37]I'll be in the bathroom.
[70:43.46]With my, oh, well, the cheese is completely, my cheese seriously is just like a black tile.
[70:48.57]If you want a little bit of context, just a little bit.
[70:51.83]I texted Star.
[70:53.29]Hey, well, get out of my station.
[70:54.57]Hey, get up.
[70:55.11]I need you to help me make a video.
[70:57.03]You dick.
[70:57.57]He didn't even, he literally didn't even like get a glass of water.
[71:00.40]He rolled out of bed.
[71:00.86]Son of a bitch.
[71:01.44]He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.
[71:03.58]I was like, hey, please get up and help me make this video.
[71:05.08]And he's like, I don't, oh, okay.
[71:06.42]And I was like, thank you.
[71:07.24]Oh my.
[71:08.30]Uh, never, um.
[71:12.28]Star, just pretend like you didn't hear that.
[71:15.40]What are you doing back here?
[71:16.88]How are you, like, multiplying these bacons, Star?
[71:19.36]Jeremy, come back here.
[71:20.74]What?
[71:21.58]He, like, wasn't even participating.
[71:23.24]I know how to break everything.
[71:25.24]Where are you?
[71:25.78]He's, like, duping.
[71:28.12]He's just duping shit.
[71:29.40]What the hell?
[71:31.86]How did you get all this bacon?
[71:32.86]I'm the Baconator.
[71:33.68]I'm the Baconator.
[71:34.96]Who's under the ground?
[71:36.00]Jeremy, you're under the ground.
[71:37.08]What the fuck?
[71:38.16]Oh, no.
[71:39.02]Who's under the ground?
[71:42.19]I'm gone.
[71:42.91]I was so hard on that.
[71:46.61]Where am I?
[71:49.33]I don't know.
[71:51.21]Somebody else fell.
[71:56.79]Who just fell?
[71:59.17]You went whizzing by my screen.
[72:03.39]Aww.
[72:04.85]I like that one.
[72:06.41]That was a lot of fun.
[72:07.19]I like that one a lot.
[72:08.04]That was bingo.
[72:16.64]No, no, we still have just one.
[72:20.76]No singing.
[72:22.02]No wait, no Drew Crew, which I'm happy about.
[72:25.76]Let's go.
[72:29.44]I'm not, well, I'm not happy that I don't, I'm just happy that it's not going to give you another space.
[72:33.70]That's pretty cool.
[72:34.70]So again, ready?
[72:35.22]Watch this.
[72:35.58]Hey, Boo Boo.
[72:36.45]Boo Boo, look it.
[72:36.97]I got like nothing in my hand.
[72:38.77]Hey, ready?
[72:41.50]Otto has not- Otto has not shown up on- on screen yet.
[72:47.20]There he is.
[72:47.95]Otto!
[72:48.05]Like, I thought this was some big stunt.
[73:02.12]Whoa, I jumped over a thing that was like five feet off the ground.
[73:07.10]Somebody help me, please.
[73:09.16]Oh, Otto.
[73:09.78]I need your help from the two dogs.
[73:12.46]Oh, you.
[73:13.44]Oh, I'm sorry.
[73:14.80]I just made you do that.
[73:16.58]Are you alright?
[73:18.48]Aw, Boo Boo.
[73:21.34]Boo Boo, you're getting stuck.
[73:23.36]You'd break your back, dude.
[73:24.53]Look at how young and handsome Otto is.
[73:27.19]Don't do that at home.
[73:27.95]You'll die instantly.
[73:32.46]Vuvu.
[73:36.76]Vuvu is a great dog.
[73:39.08]Well, okay.
[73:40.59]The video's over.
[73:43.79]Where does that leave us here?
[73:47.27]Okay.
[73:50.51]That's also 2013.
[73:50.99]2013.
[73:51.03]That's not a Jex moment.
[73:52.37]No, it's not.
[74:07.01]Okay.
[74:08.63]You're really looking for a Vroomer.
[74:13.41]Vroomer is really the only way you can get anything again.
[74:18.41]Replay the video.
[74:20.38]No, that's not how it works.
[74:24.56]It's only a matter of time.
[74:25.38]It is actually, it's possible.
[74:27.20]There was a lot of times that happened in Vegas.
[74:30.70]This is taking from every single arc.
[74:34.36]This is taking from Boston Arc, Vegas Arc, Vegas Arc 2, right?
[74:39.13]Alright, let's keep going.
[74:49.75]Where are we going to go next?
[74:52.20]That's the question.
[74:52.78]Nitro!
[74:54.92]Whoa, the Nitro is kind of crazy.
[75:00.16]Road Redemption.
[75:01.81]Nitro again.
[75:03.19]This is not a rumor.
[75:07.12]It's okay.
[75:07.78]I'm still alive.
[75:09.68]I can still do this.
[75:10.68]No, this is not a rumor.
[75:11.76]Let's go, you son of a bitches.
[75:16.47]Total carnage.
[75:19.49]Oh, boy.
[75:21.59]Did you see how much stuff just got crashed?
[75:24.54]Did you see?
[75:27.56]Oh my god!
[75:31.78]No, seriously.
[75:33.44]Laughing fit is a free space.
[75:34.48]This is like tactical intervention.
[75:37.27]I'm having more flashbacks.
[75:39.99]I'm just kidding.
[75:42.16]You know, I saw the Jerma laughs at car crashes compilation.
[75:45.52]It's like four hours long.
[75:46.10]So I have to attract cops?
[75:47.64]I already have like a thousand cops.
[75:54.01]Oh, I don't laugh at just car.
[75:56.21]Okay.
[75:56.73]I laugh at, it's the end of the video.
[75:58.61]I don't laugh.
[75:59.17]Okay.
[75:59.43]I don't just laugh at car crashes.
[76:01.04]Okay.
[76:02.38]I laugh at just chaos, like just carnage.
[76:06.60]Chaos is like just anything that's absurdly happening makes me laugh.
[76:11.60]That's just the way it is.
[76:13.44]Anything.
[76:16.18]Car like crashes in a game are just like absurd on their own, right?
[76:21.00]Where are we going?
[76:21.68]Ears are fine.
[76:22.24]This is another movie screen.
[76:24.54]What's going on with his mouth?
[76:25.44]I think I'm going to veto this.
[76:32.67]I don't know what's happening with his mouth here, but whatever.
[76:34.47]Because we're going to sit at a character creator for three minutes.
[76:40.67]Veto.
[76:41.79]I'm using my second veto.
[76:45.97]I have three more.
[76:46.51]Go.
[76:47.29]Go.
[76:51.59]I don't even remember playing this game.
[77:07.42]I don't even know what this is.
[77:14.84]Who's left?
[77:17.70]One guy?
[77:23.19]Jax?
[77:23.59]No, this is easy.
[77:30.29]I could have been fine.
[77:35.91]One guy?
[77:36.21]Nope.
[77:36.87]Has to be one guy in chat.
[77:47.67]You said one guy.
[77:48.63]No, it has to be a reference to one guy in the chat.
[77:53.48]Am I stuck here forever?
[77:54.36]I need to, like, leave this building.
[78:00.86]Get me out of here.
[78:01.60]I'm stuck here forever.
[78:02.50]I can't leave.
[78:02.96]This game was decent.
[78:04.28]I just... I have no memory of this.
[78:07.16]Why?
[78:11.83]Die, please.
[78:12.55]How come I don't know... I... I don't know who... This is not even me playing.
[78:20.46]Dick shot purgatory.
[78:21.72]That's where we are.
[78:23.12]I can't get out.
[78:25.70]There has to be like an exit, right?
[78:27.16]Like to the kitchen?
[78:29.90]That was so stupid.
[78:31.42]What am I supposed to do?
[78:32.58]How do I get out of this?
[78:40.48]Is that guy running from me?
[78:41.53]I don't know.
[78:41.95]I can't tell.
[78:43.72]I don't even know what's going on.
[78:45.44]This is never-ending enemies.
[78:46.51]I need to escape.
[78:47.63]What the fuck?
[78:58.69]I had to play the whole thing again probably.
[78:59.78]How far into the... Okay, this is 39 minutes into the... Oh boy, this ends in 20 minutes.
[79:04.76]Get me out of here.
[79:06.10]Get me out.
[79:06.68]I just need to find the exit.
[79:08.22]It's upstairs.
[79:08.88]It has to be here.
[79:11.99]I only streamed this game for an hour.
[79:13.26]I don't think I need- I think I need to kill everybody.
[79:15.00]I don't think there is an exit.
[79:20.56]There's no exit.
[79:23.44]We're just gonna sit here.
[79:26.94]We're just gonna sit here.
[79:30.85]This is okay with me.
[79:32.31]I think I found the secret.
[79:34.89]God, zombies, staircase.
[79:38.19]It does.
[79:38.59]Yeah, it is the way to do it.
[79:40.03]I went.
[79:40.37]We're good.
[79:44.92]I think this is one of the Xbox 360 streams of the stairs.
[79:49.38]What happened?
[79:51.90]So whatever you guys want to see first, I was like into that one.
[79:55.26]But tonight, tonight, tonight we have obviously.
[80:01.65]What is this?
[80:02.15]Late Shift.
[80:02.73]Something else we're doing.
[80:04.03]Oh, this is the FMV game.
[80:05.15]Let's get this down here.
[80:06.73]Alright, we're going to be playing Casino Inc.
[80:09.66]Look, I don't know anything about this game.
[80:11.06]I saw it on Steam.
[80:12.88]I saw it actually on Amazon first and I was seeing if it was on Steam.
[80:15.44]Oh, if he only knew.
[80:16.60]Right.
[80:16.80]This game is going to be fucking stupid.
[80:18.28]But there are a couple of options.
[80:19.51]We have a couple of game sucks options.
[80:21.17]Oh, if he only knew.
[80:22.01]So don't worry.
[80:24.63]I was talking about how that could be like, eh, maybe it looks like it sucks.
[80:27.07]Let's turn this off and bring this up.
[80:32.30]Should be working now.
[80:33.46]And here's the one problem with this.
[80:36.06]Let me get my CLR visor back on.
[80:37.80]Okay.
[80:40.26]It's going to be really hard for me to see any, like, bits.
[80:44.28]And, like, right when I say that, the second I say that, here comes fucking Glue Man.
[80:49.46]Like, the second I talk about how I can't see bits, all of a sudden fucking Glue Man comes up, the fucking Jerma suplex.
[80:55.38]Oh, shit.
[80:55.88]That's right.
[80:56.24]I forgot about the animated bit stuff.
[80:59.21]Thank you, KXZ.
[81:01.29]501.
[81:01.37]And thanks a lot for the bits.
[81:03.07]Also, thank you to Stix Renegade.
[81:06.09]And you know, James Big Mac.
[81:07.97]Who could forget James Big Mac?
[81:10.61]I think KXC's went through.
[81:12.67]I'm not sure Stix's went through.
[81:14.99]Because they were being utilized.
[81:17.13]We're not going to say anything.
[81:18.21]Just pretend some of those suplexes were from you.
[81:19.89]Stix.
[81:24.33]Pretend some of those were from you.
[81:25.25]Banking subs, yeah.

[81:27.91]Remember when I used to thank you?

[81:31.68]Each.
[81:33.00]And KXZ says, let me just get this up.
[81:36.24]Is it going to work?
[81:37.16]Come on now.
[81:38.48]KXZ says, right now?
[81:40.04]Are you kidding me?
[81:40.66]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[81:41.60]Are you serious?
[81:42.94]Let the bits flow, lads.
[81:45.59]You're here right now.
[81:46.67]Mod James.
[81:47.69]No, no, we're not doing this joke tonight.
[81:49.79]No, that joke is done.
[81:50.85]What's going on, James?
[81:51.61]We're not doing that.
[81:53.27]But KXE, thank you so much.
[81:54.53]And also, thank you to Styx.
[81:59.60]I have that also.

[82:05.00]Glad to know you're alright from it.
[82:07.06]Much love also, by the way.
[82:07.98]Who is talking?
[82:09.96]What?
[82:17.52]No, no, the winks are only for when they're in stream.
[82:20.20]Somebody gave like $450 earlier.
[82:21.92]Who's talking?
[82:22.80]When it wasn't online.
[82:24.24]Okay, I'm going to veto this if it doesn't end in 10 seconds.
[82:26.44]Alright, 20 seconds.
[82:27.92]Um, I have no idea.
[82:29.10]I didn't see it pop up or anything.
[82:30.42]Okay, those of you, everybody that was, okay.
[82:33.08]Before this ends.
[82:34.46]Thank you.
[82:35.86]Thank you.
[82:36.90]$4,500.
[82:36.98]This is back when I used to read things.
[82:39.18]Alright, let's get this going.
[82:41.17]I'm not going to extend this, no.
[82:43.87]Uh...
[82:44.83]The gum you like is coming back?
[82:46.67]What gum?
[82:47.31]Wait, is it gum that I liked?
[82:48.97]No, we're not extending.
[82:49.91]Go!
[82:54.42]Uh-oh.
[82:58.24]Uh-oh.
[83:01.76]Although this is a really relaxing part, so I think we're fine.
[83:04.45]I think we're good.
[83:12.79]This is gonna take two minutes.
[83:14.09]I can't move by the way.
[83:15.37]Oh sh- God damn it.
[83:16.35]I'm so sorry.
[83:17.09]I'm trying to move.
[83:18.34]Do it again.
[83:18.76]Pfft.
[83:22.10]Picked a perfect place.
[83:23.74]I just like cut them off.
[83:26.24]My hair is permanently messed up from when I smashed the coffee into the ground.
[83:33.02]From the top.
[83:36.10]I could veto this, but I'm not gonna.
[83:38.96]Go outside wide.
[83:41.62]It's alright.
[83:42.06]They're gonna do it again.
[83:42.88]Again is a joke.
[83:44.28]I'm not doing it again.
[83:45.33]I want to hear the whole thing.
[83:46.97]Come on, guys.
[83:54.91]Let's work this patience.
[83:58.67]P-break?
[83:59.01]No, I'm good.
[83:59.95]Extend it or suffer the consequences.
[84:01.41]No, no.
[84:01.99]This is not how the game works.
[84:03.59]It's a 10-minute song.
[84:07.95]You should take a break.
[84:08.85]You should go BRB.
[84:11.07]No, I'm fine.
[84:15.23]Oh, that's why you're saying that.
[84:16.19]Easy, chat.
[84:16.97]Easy.
[84:19.07]Easy.
[84:19.29]Don't make me get the spray can.
[84:21.61]Don't make me get the fucking spray can.
[84:23.08]If everyone wants to talk shit... Stop it!
[84:28.02]What the fuck is he doing?
[84:34.56]That's to get the shit out of me, and I did it.
[84:40.69]nitrous oxide by webcam.
[84:44.25]Holy shit.
[84:46.37]I look like deranged.
[84:48.95]I look red and sweaty and what the fuck?
[84:53.57]Your cat just like freaked out.
[84:54.98]103, not 114.
[85:00.34]Oh, I'm so glad this is not in the middle of me freaking out.
[85:02.86]The bumblebee level.
[85:03.62]Actually, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[85:05.82]Let's go.
[85:06.22]I want to see what simple does.
[85:07.40]Just out of curiosity.
[85:09.14]Simple.
[85:09.78]What does it do?
[85:10.38]Did I beat the game?
[85:11.40]I think I beat the game.
[85:12.99]Yes, that's true.
[85:13.57]I just want to see what simple does.
[85:18.41]Like, is it really simple?
[85:20.43]Now you know how we feel.
[85:23.89]Not really.
[85:25.07]I mean, it's pretty simple.
[85:27.71]It's fairly simple.
[85:30.64]Damn, when's the DLC for this game gonna come out?
[85:32.83]I'm looking forward to that.
[85:34.17]2024?
[85:34.21]It was canceled?
[85:34.71]No.
[85:34.77]No, it wasn't.
[85:35.25]Are you serious?
[85:35.85]No.
[85:35.95]That can't be.
[85:36.29]Fantastic!
[85:36.55]I really love you, Jay!
[86:00.10]Who's that Pokémon?
[86:01.86]I veto this one, I think.
[86:07.02]I have three more videos where I think I'm vetoing this.
[86:11.92]This is a veto.
[86:13.66]Hey guys, I'll trade you my holographic Charizard for your holographic Shmee.
[86:18.28]No, I'm vetoing this one.
[86:19.46]This one's vetoed.
[86:20.20]It's vetoed.
[86:22.04]A holographic Shmee is worth like, is worth like $500,000.
[86:28.25]You're gonna try to rip me off right now?
[86:30.91]There's only one in the world, but I've got the one with Japanese text.
[86:35.56]Do you really?
[86:36.74]Do you seriously have that?
[86:39.38]Did you guys ever, like, play Pokémon trading card games?
[86:41.86]Do you seriously have that card, though?
[86:43.14]Because I kind of want it.
[86:45.25]With the Japanese text.
[86:50.14]I hope I'm still funny like 10 years later.
[86:51.70]Oh my goodness, man, are you okay?
[86:53.74]That went right into his mouth.
[86:55.18]Dude, are you alright?
[86:56.14]Please get me to a doctor!
[86:57.12]I'm sorry, just chill out.
[86:58.56]I gotta pull the arrow out, though.
[86:59.72]Um... Hold on, just don't talk.
[87:01.72]Get it out of me, mate, come on!
[87:02.86]I'm trying, dude, I'm really sorry I did that.
[87:05.39]Oh my god, fucking help, guys, help, please.
[87:07.27]I fucking murdered this guy.
[87:11.01]Turbo, where are you?
[87:12.85]Gotta get you away from the scene of the crime.
[87:14.67]It was alright.
[87:15.03]I wanna see your trophy, person.
[87:16.91]Oh, he's gone, it's too bad.
[87:18.05]It was absolutely heinous looking.
[87:20.79]No.
[87:23.39]Was it a sniper?
[87:25.03]Is it this boo?
[87:27.21]Alex?
[87:27.39]Man, that took a lot to do that.
[87:29.17]That took a lot to do that.
[87:30.01]This was the old crew.
[87:30.81]Alright, I found nobody.
[87:32.90]Nobody scared the spy.
[87:34.88]I found a spy.
[87:36.06]It's guaranteed that he's a spy.
[87:37.96]Where are you?
[87:38.64]Just don't like scare him.
[87:39.60]Don't scare him.
[87:40.38]He's running really slow.
[87:41.16]He doesn't think I know he's a spy.
[87:43.06]I don't know where you are.
[87:44.32]He's a scout.
[87:44.94]Don't kill him.
[87:46.06]I loved this so much.
[87:47.63]Oh, you're right behind him.
[87:48.35]Just following around a spy that was you, Boof.
[87:54.44]Baby Shpee.
[87:55.66]I loved it.
[87:56.16]It was amazing.
[87:57.06]I'm sorry.
[87:59.26]Nothing will ever replace how much fun you could have in Team Fortress.
[88:04.50]I don't give a shit who says otherwise.
[88:06.70]Nothing will ever replace it.
[88:07.86]I'm really sorry.
[88:10.00]I'm playing shithead Natascha Gibbers.
[88:12.46]Team Fortress 2 is every single drug ever made combined into an oral pill that you take.
[88:17.69]Oh boy.
[88:18.55]And it's every single thing.
[88:20.73]It's every single drug ever made.
[88:21.95]Okay.
[88:25.38]Don't do what I was going to do to you, you punk.
[88:28.72]Only 20 seconds.
[88:29.30]I'm good.
[88:30.98]Wait.
[88:34.24]What?
[88:34.48]Why?
[88:34.70]What did I just kill?
[88:37.20]Random crits.
[88:38.56]What?
[88:39.02]I'm so confused right now from that.
[88:40.78]10 seconds.
[88:42.32]Here we go.
[88:44.36]No, that's an accidental Jax.
[88:46.13]That's not a real Jax.
[88:48.47]Scout on point.
[88:49.21]Scout on point.
[88:50.89]Scout on point.
[88:52.35]Screw it.
[88:55.01]Uh oh.
[88:55.23]It's going to get scooped up there.
[88:57.67]This is going to be a ramp.
[89:01.47]For sure.
[89:01.75]I remember this.
[89:02.69]Everyone called me an idiot.
[89:04.35]It's going up.
[89:06.71]Up here.
[89:07.03]Okay.
[89:12.79]Then it goes that way.
[89:15.18]That's going fast.
[89:19.92]This game was a lot of fun though.
[89:20.94]I like this.
[89:21.36]And then...
[89:30.01]Smarties are great, yeah.
[89:32.17]They're very delicious.
[89:33.81]If you eat them, I wouldn't put them anywhere else.
[89:38.14]I've done this, like, this is such a nervous habit.
[89:44.06]I remember reading the chat and people saying, like, can't even solve a simple puzzle.
[89:47.36]Like, seriously, dude, I'm, like, actually worried about you.
[89:49.94]Like, I'm worried about you, dude.
[89:51.09]Like, no, we're not fucking around.
[89:52.33]And I got, like, pissed.
[89:54.49]I think I get actually pissed here.
[89:55.79]Hopefully it doesn't happen in the next minute, too.
[89:57.79]It's exhausting pretending.
[90:04.46]Scoop it already.
[90:05.44]Come on, man.
[90:06.22]Oh, I'm going to have to do this again.
[90:08.26]Alright, come on.
[90:17.33]There's timing.
[90:18.15]Where did he go?
[90:19.05]I think I'm in the clear, though.
[90:20.19]Shit, I think I fucked it up again.
[90:22.42]I think it's like another two or three minutes after this at least.
[90:25.76]Because I was here for like 30 minutes.
[90:29.01]Hey!
[90:31.99]Kid, what the fuck?
[90:34.47]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[90:39.37]Extend it?
[90:40.41]Way too early, alright.
[90:42.05]I'm just giving you a free space if I do that.
[90:45.61]Alright, fine.
[90:47.23]You get your reverse veto.
[90:48.45]This is number two, by the way.
[90:54.76]Timer officially extended.
[90:56.22]That's your second veto.
[90:58.38]And it counts for a reverse veto as well.
[91:02.28]So you only have three more of these left.
[91:03.34]What is it?
[91:16.09]That was dumb.
[91:16.73]What the hell happened?
[91:18.05]Oh, here we go.
[91:19.29]Once I start getting quiet, I start talking like this.
[91:21.95]Yeah, what happened there?
[91:23.05]What happened?
[91:23.33]What's going on?
[91:23.97]Like, what the fuck?
[91:25.23]That's the fucking stupid.
[91:25.99]Whenever you hear me start to do that, that's when, like, you know that I'm probably red off camera.
[91:30.18]And I'm looking over here, like, right here, and I see, like, holy shit, I did this in fucking ten seconds.
[91:35.62]I think this actually is the one.
[91:36.60]This dude's a fucking idiot.
[91:37.60]Like, this dude sucks.
[91:38.59]Like, how does he have this many viewers and shit?
[91:40.61]Like, when I start to see that, I'm just like... Ugh!
[91:52.88]You just have to laugh it off a little bit, and then once you realize that you don't know what you're actually doing, and everybody else does, you start to, like, stamp your feet like a little baby.
[92:02.62]Go.
[92:36.70]I got this.
[92:37.10]Yeah, this is the one.
[92:38.70]Got it.
[92:39.20]It's not the one.
[92:42.26]What an idiot.
[92:43.16]Holy shit.
[92:44.71]Oh, my God.
[92:45.51]Seeing that again was fucking so bad.
[92:48.09]But, like, it's a big hole to fit it in.
[92:51.01]Holy shit.
[92:51.41]I really thought that's what you did.
[92:57.45]Wow.
[92:58.63]But I... Come on.
[92:59.57]Anybody could have made that mistake.
[93:07.67]Okay, I thought the arrows were talking about, like, I, like, you, like, tilt this.
[93:12.30]Tilt it.
[93:13.04]Well, look, you gotta tilt it around and get it in the middle.
[93:17.62]Those old stupid toys.
[93:19.14]I thought it was like, tilt, tilt it, tilt it around, get it in the middle.
[93:21.89]I didn't, okay.
[93:27.19]I think I fall off here, too, and it escalates.
[93:29.47]Alright, I'm gonna give you another extend.
[93:30.97]I'll give you one more for free.
[93:36.60]I'll give you another one for free.
[93:38.33]Shit.
[93:42.09]I thought it was just like, oh, get it in the hole.
[93:44.56]Didn't he say get it in that hole, too?
[93:46.66]Didn't he say something like that?
[93:48.06]Like, oh, make sure you get it in the hole.
[93:49.44]Didn't he say that?
[93:53.94]You fell off.
[93:55.18]Yeah.
[93:59.79]I think at this point, when I mess this up again...
[94:06.67]What was that?
[94:08.33]What happened?
[94:14.80]Congratulations!
[94:16.06]You solved the puzzle!
[94:20.00]It took a ton- Oh, no, wait.
[94:21.66]412.
[94:21.68]4-1-2-2-5.
[94:21.82]4-1-2-2-5.
[94:22.02]What's going on?
[94:23.25]I thought it was 4-1-1-2-5.
[94:33.94]Oh, that's right.
[94:35.26]We did an elaborate thing where I made people go skip around the VOD and shit, right?
[94:42.83]I completely forgot about that.
[94:45.79]We did the VOD puzzle.
[94:47.99]Oh, yeah.
[94:52.28]Why did I pull the controller out?
[94:56.60]I specifically remember everybody hating this bit.
[95:00.14]I thought it was genius, and everybody was like, this sucks, dude.
[95:02.84]Just play the game.
[95:04.12]I was putting, like, little clues and hints.
[95:05.90]Imagine not solving it.
[95:07.52]To, like, go to a specific point in the VOD, right?
[95:10.56]It was four hours and, like, 12 seconds or something, right?
[95:14.37]And, like, the whole idea.
[95:15.17]Congratulations, you solved the puzzle.
[95:17.07]You did it.
[95:17.99]You did everything possible.
[95:19.45]It was funny as a VOD watcher.
[95:20.99]Yeah.
[95:26.61]screaming on here is yelling on here no it's not we're good congratulations we're good by the way uh I just did that into my chair and I've been sitting on this
[95:56.50]Oh yeah, that's disgusting.
[95:59.34]I don't know why, yeah, I got up, I put my face directly into the bottom of the chair.
[96:04.96]I don't want to scream because that's way too loud.
[96:08.16]I'm like, I gotta muffle it somehow.
[96:11.49]Yeah, it was gross.
[96:13.09]I realized it was fucking vile.
[96:18.69]I think I'm in the clear.
[96:19.35]We're not extending it again.
[96:20.29]We're good.
[96:21.50]Oh, okay.
[96:23.10]You ate your own ass.
[96:26.57]Alright, where are we going?
[96:30.05]No, we're not extending.
[96:32.77]You got to see at least that part.
[96:34.33]Let's go.
[96:34.67]Where is it?
[96:35.85]Alright, okay.
[96:37.31]...into the stars and torn into a thousand pieces.
[96:40.73]But if this spell was intended to destroy, it does not.
[96:43.31]You are caught by the stars and held.
[96:45.95]This is it.
[96:48.85]Oh, I love this game.
[96:50.91]What an amazing game.
[96:53.75]What?
[96:55.25]Come on.
[96:56.57]By the way, if you have not played Sorcery, it's on everything.
[96:59.54]It's on iOS, Android, Steam, everything.
[97:03.08]No!
[97:05.72]Jesus Christ.
[97:07.72]No!
[97:07.94]Go get it and please, for the love of God, play the game.
[97:11.62]If you want a list of like, oh, what's your top five games of all time?
[97:16.24]Sorcery is up there.
[97:18.02]No, no, no.
[97:20.66]Oh, no.
[97:22.60]At least probably like number four or three.
[97:26.85]You're just refluxed.
[97:27.93]I don't... Whatever.
[97:28.59]I'm drinking coffee.
[97:29.29]Whatever.
[97:34.02]Son of a gun.
[97:40.60]I have to go all the way back up there.
[97:42.10]I sound kind of pissed off, though.
[97:45.87]Where is this?
[97:46.47]This is... I can't rewind.
[97:47.75]Rewind.
[97:48.49]Rewind.
[97:48.89]Okay.
[97:50.51]Rez is the only other spell that can counter death.
[97:54.01]Yeah, but there's nothing to Rez.
[97:58.98]And the text made it seem like that was what I needed to do.
[98:01.58]I know.
[98:02.14]They're so good, too.
[98:02.66]I wanna scroll up.
[98:03.76]I think the fourth one's probably the worst.
[98:05.12]No rewinds.
[98:05.73]Didn't it say, like, oh, you're held in the stars?
[98:07.61]It was correct.
[98:08.73]The fourth one has so much weird shit that you have to do, right?
[98:11.13]But, like, Sorcery 1, 2, and a lot of 3 are phenomenal.
[98:16.89]Spellify, it's just telling me that, okay.
[98:18.48]So it's dock, file, tell, zed.
[98:24.76]When, how long ago was this?
[98:27.94]I figured it was just going to put me in front of her.
[98:30.67]2014?
[98:31.89]No, 2015?
[98:32.89]This was 2016.
[98:33.83]This is one of the first... I'm just going right back there and see what happens.
[98:37.13]Well, no, because this wasn't out yet, right?
[98:38.93]When I started streaming.
[98:40.09]This came out a little bit further after I started streaming.
[98:41.99]I just want to see if we can get in there.
[98:43.11]2016?
[98:43.29]Yeah.
[98:44.81]We're doing a speed run.
[98:47.39]Eatbox?
[98:48.09]Hello, yes, I'm a guard captain.
[98:49.47]How nice to meet you.
[98:51.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah, make a move.
[98:53.43]What's the actual best game of all time?
[98:54.89]Hi, guys.
[98:55.35]I don't know.
[98:58.74]Yeah, alright.
[98:59.26]Bye-bye-bye.
[98:59.84]Return the salute.
[99:00.56]See you later.
[99:01.02]Fucking Mario Paint.
[99:01.44]Thank you for your encouraged... Encourager, yeah.
[99:04.58]Beat that guy up.
[99:05.30]Kick his ass.
[99:06.12]Nice work.
[99:06.50]Good luck.
[99:06.96]We're safe here.
[99:07.34]Good luck.
[99:10.20]No, the correct answer is Team Fortress 2, Diablo II, World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, Bloodborne, Sorcery, uh...
[99:29.48]Something like that.
[99:31.94]Keep going.
[99:33.18]Three seconds.
[99:34.56]This is a right pain in the ass.
[99:35.69]Dorsey is not top five.
[99:36.73]Ban that person for at least five seconds.
[99:38.45]I never wash my hands.
[99:40.15]Let's touch some people's food now.
[99:43.60]Hey, how you doing?
[99:44.66]What can I get you, miss?
[99:45.60]Yes, hi, how you doing?
[99:46.52]I'd like a regular burger with some tomato, some onion, a little bit of lettuce, a medium well burger, please, thank you.
[99:53.54]A little bit more onion, a little bit more lettuce, and can you please toast the bun, please?
[99:57.94]Thank you.
[99:58.41]Yes, yours absolutely, sweetheart.
[100:01.97]Toasted fucking bun.
[100:02.99]I'll give you a toasted fucking bun.
[100:09.16]Flipping those bodies, oh so right.
[100:12.48]You don't wanna screw up anybody's order tonight.
[100:15.93]Because if you do, you're gonna get fired from this job that you need so much.
[100:23.05]Where do you go to find ketchup?
[100:26.31]It's sitting right in front of you, you don't know that much.
[100:29.46]And you squeeze from your bottom to make sure it all comes out to bake.
[100:35.00]Hey, I was having a fucking moment right there.
[100:38.80]Alright, just want to be clear on this right now, because there is some confusion.
[100:42.35]You did not want a complete head of lettuce between two pieces of bread?
[100:47.39]No.
[100:48.39]Well, what the fuck did you want?
[100:50.74]Look, I get it.
[100:51.56]I understand you're upset.
[100:52.92]It's taking a while to get you food.
[100:55.10]Everybody chill out and just listen for a second.
[100:57.38]Nobody cares, okay?
[100:59.29]They're right back at you, dickhead.
[101:01.13]But anyway, I am the only person working here.
[101:04.31]Don't you see that?
[101:05.51]My boss is a cheap son of a bitch.
[101:07.37]He's not going to hire anybody else.
[101:08.83]I'm doing the books, I'm doing the cashier, and I'm doing the cooking.
[101:12.53]How fucked up is this?
[101:14.37]Actually, it is.
[101:15.15]Right?
[101:15.85]Wow.
[101:16.29]That is pretty fucked up.
[101:17.99]That's terrible.
[101:18.65]I know.
[101:18.99]Like, where are all the other workers?
[101:22.55]Seriously, all this game has taught me is how much it sucks to work in the restaurant business.
[101:28.98]Like, I don't ever want to do this.
[101:31.18]I never want a restaurant job in my life because of how fucking awful this is.
[101:36.48]And I give two thumbs up to anybody that is doing a restaurant job right now.
[101:40.66]This is ten years ago.
[101:41.56]And if you'll excuse me for one second.
[101:48.92]What is this?
[101:51.00]Yes, I would like two large cheese pizzas.
[101:54.02]And I want them crispy on the bottom.
[101:56.20]Not like last time when I didn't get them crispy.
[101:59.22]You understand?
[101:59.84]Oh, I see what I'm doing.
[102:01.35]And I also want some free drinks too.
[102:03.73]Otherwise, I'm going to complain to your boss.
[102:06.51]Dickhead.
[102:08.29]I get it.
[102:08.97]I see what I'm doing.
[102:09.49]Alright, we'll do singing.
[102:14.83]Was that video 2013?
[102:24.52]That was a rant, too?
[102:25.64]Oh, shit.
[102:29.04]That actually might be a rant.
[102:36.27]Could be.
[102:38.29]Nope, it wasn't.
[102:39.47]Because that was not... Oh, shit.
[102:42.11]Frog Detective.
[102:42.55]Alright, hold on.
[102:43.23]I gotta get this.
[102:48.48]No, what you doing in my Wellington?
[102:50.10]No, stop it.
[102:51.26]Stop it.
[102:51.97]What you doing in my Wellington?
[102:52.93]No, don't.
[102:53.81]TikTok.
[102:55.45]Alright, what do we got?
[102:57.75]I need two more pies.
[102:59.01]What was that?
[102:59.59]What was it?
[102:59.89]Did you see that?
[103:05.27]Where is it?
[103:06.06]Where is it?
[103:06.34]Oh, it's literally right here.
[103:09.80]Hello, is anyone home?
[103:14.18]Sounds like somebody's inside, but I shouldn't intrude on.
[103:16.54]I'll come back another time.
[103:19.68]Oh, they're doing something weird and gross on TikTok.
[103:23.08]What you doing?
[103:23.62]No, stop it.
[103:24.80]What you doing to my Wellington?
[103:25.86]Stop.
[103:26.67]Don't do that.
[103:28.71]You're a detective.
[103:31.33]Yeah, and I'm detectiving.
[103:33.47]People don't know what I'm doing there?
[103:36.83]That's not me doing an impression of Gordon.
[103:40.18]That's not me doing an impression.
[103:42.94]That's like, that's what he does on TikTok.
[103:45.13]He just like tells people that's, they make Wellingtons and like send him like an M&M's Wellington and he goes, that's my Wellington.
[103:51.61]What are you doing?
[103:52.11]Stop.
[103:52.43]Wow, wow, wowie, wowie, wowie.
[103:54.29]Singing?
[103:54.75]Oh shit, you're right.
[104:00.87]Look, idiot.
[104:01.97]Look, idiot.
[104:02.73]I thought I was, I don't know.
[104:03.61]I thought he was talking to me.
[104:04.33]Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[104:06.39]I honestly thought that somebody was saying that to me.
[104:08.01]Like, you were calling me an idiot and I heard you or something.
[104:10.43]That was weird.
[104:10.81]Look, he's stupid.
[104:11.87]Look, he's stupid.
[104:15.37]Shut up.
[104:16.25]I'm mad at him.
[104:17.05]Like, I'm fucking annoyed with him right now.
[104:19.09]Is that weird?
[104:19.63]Is this, like, a weird thing to say?
[104:20.99]I, like, I'm pissed off at what I just said.
[104:22.53]I'm annoyed by that.
[104:23.53]Alright, um... Right, we gotta do... Singing...
[104:34.45]A rare doy doy doy is going to have to show up here for you to get another one.
[104:38.15]I don't think you're going to get another bingo.
[104:40.37]By the way, every bingo is another 100 community sucks.
[104:44.61]It's a lost pie.
[104:45.23]I need one more.
[104:46.43]There's a huge deer in the water.
[104:47.81]Take rant off.
[104:48.43]I can see the deer in the water.
[104:49.73]Okay.
[104:50.59]That's fair.
[104:51.11]Because that was not me ranting.
[104:53.19]That was the character grandpa ranting.
[104:55.81]Right?
[104:57.37]I mean, the rant was... I feel like it's justified rant.
[105:01.58]But that was not necessarily me ranting.
[105:06.02]Got it.
[105:07.64]And go.
[105:09.64]The rant has to come from... The rant was a bit... Alright, well let's get this off.
[105:15.50]We can see what's going on here.
[105:19.38]Okay.
[105:20.38]Frog Detective, this is really fun.
[105:21.86]Is Frog Detective 3 out?
[105:24.54]What?
[105:25.48]I know they were doing another one, weren't they?
[105:30.60]Not yet?
[105:31.16]Alright, what do you want?
[105:33.15]Uh, here are your pies.
[105:33.91]We gotta bring the voice actor back.
[105:34.99]All five of them.
[105:38.38]And... It's very simple.
[105:41.84]There's like two buttons to this game.
[105:43.42]There's a punch, and there's a kick.
[105:45.32]And apparently there's a jump.
[105:46.30]Yeah, there is.
[105:47.12]Hit fighter.
[105:47.54]That's just beautiful looking, by the way.
[105:49.54]Come here, you fat fuck.
[105:53.60]No!
[105:54.83]Look, your health's in the top left.
[105:57.05]I gotta beat this guy!
[105:58.97]I got five, he's got five.
[106:01.32]It's over.
[106:01.80]I lost.
[106:02.08]That was the game, by the way.
[106:04.88]A nine-minute video?
[106:06.68]Another really stupid thing that you're probably going to realize is each one of these guys has the same stupid sound when you pick anyone.
[106:15.89]I just picked this guy.
[106:17.11]Ready?
[106:17.33]Listen to this.
[106:21.25]Look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way.
[106:26.23]I don't remember any crowd being, like, sepia-tone in my life.
[106:32.22]Alright, hold on.
[106:32.64]I might be able to pull this out.
[106:33.62]I might be able to pull this through.
[106:35.14]I feel like we've already seen the whole video.
[106:36.36]Did you see the little spin kick?
[106:39.82]I think we've seen the whole video already.
[106:40.96]This is like the tutorial.
[106:45.12]Oh, damn it.
[106:46.10]Damn it.
[106:46.48]I got it.
[106:47.38]I got it.
[106:48.44]Alright.
[106:49.72]That's the first time I've ever beat that guy.
[106:51.93]So, that's a good thing.
[106:53.53]Why am I on a forklift?
[106:56.13]How do you say it?
[106:56.89]Match two.
[106:57.33]You guys ready?
[106:58.79]Match two.
[106:59.45]Sepia, right?
[107:00.75]Look at my health!
[107:02.82]What?
[107:04.68]Why did I start with that little health?
[107:06.84]Sepia.
[107:08.54]That's correct.
[107:09.00]What are you talking about?
[107:10.45]That's Sepia.
[107:15.73]I'm just surprised this is a nine minute video.
[107:18.02]Okay, I have 65 health.
[107:22.59]I'm gonna start the next fight with 65 health.
[107:25.08]It's too late to veto this, but I want to.
[107:26.86]That's fucking bullshit.
[107:29.80]That is absolute, complete, utter crap.
[107:32.88]Look at this guy has 260 health.
[107:35.72]This game is not possible to complete.
[107:38.12]You can't complete this.
[107:39.20]That actually is bullshit though.
[107:41.02]How would you ever be able to do this?
[107:44.10]It doesn't make any sense.
[107:45.02]It doesn't make any sense why that would ever be a thing.
[107:50.60]Every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life, this is Street Fighter 1, this is Clay Fighter, that's like a staple of all fighters.
[108:00.81]Why would you ever remove that?
[108:02.53]Why would you ever not do that?
[108:04.45]Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round.
[108:07.84]Why would you remove that from this game?
[108:10.14]That's what I don't get.
[108:11.16]I don't understand that.
[108:11.96]Okay.
[108:14.50]You got it.
[108:14.84]This game is so fucking stupid.
[108:22.88]I just want to get past the first two guys.
[108:25.01]You're a fighting game expert.
[108:27.01]But that's true, though.
[108:28.19]You started a new round.
[108:29.35]I don't even know who made this game.
[108:32.79]All I remember is playing Super Nintendo and the arcade.
[108:35.77]This was in the arcades.
[108:38.49]How much money do you think people wasted on this server for more than 15 seconds?
[108:43.55]Let's see if I can do it.
[108:46.85]Is that you?
[108:47.21]Are you the pyro?
[108:48.25]Nope.
[108:50.03]TF2.
[108:50.47]Nope.
[108:52.01]Another rare TF2 video.
[108:54.29]Oh, your pathetic little grenades just bounce off my manly chest.
[109:01.41]Come on, shoot me again.
[109:02.37]Didn't work.
[109:03.89]It didn't even work.
[109:05.25]Wow.
[109:06.58]I didn't know it protected against that.
[109:08.44]I am completely protected.
[109:09.82]Yeah, that's Ster.
[109:10.96]Okay, let's see how long you stay alive at the mid-fight.
[109:14.07]Why was I so jaded?
[109:14.98]If I die at this mid-fight, I have to, like, drink the rest of my iced coffee as fast as I can.
[109:19.10]I feel like I've been jaded since I was, like, fucking 19.
[109:21.42]God damn it, why did I just say that?
[109:23.24]I don't think that's ever changed.
[109:24.42]That was not a good idea.
[109:25.36]That was, like, 12, that was, like, 10 years ago.
[109:27.12]That'll hurt your head.
[109:28.12]Don't hide in the corner, either.
[109:30.62]No, I'm going up balls to the wall.
[109:33.16]This is happening.
[109:34.49]I cannot die here.
[109:35.67]Here we go, baby.
[109:37.13]Smoke it.
[109:38.13]That was a terrible jump.
[109:40.59]I still try to see the good in things.
[109:42.07]I do.
[109:43.35]Smoke it.
[109:45.47]Get this pyro out of here.
[109:48.79]I lived.
[109:49.17]I don't have to drink my iced coffee as fast as I can.
[109:52.68]Disciplined emotional.
[109:53.56]That's right.
[109:56.00]That is absolutely correct.
[109:57.80]I thought you didn't have that much health.
[110:01.48]It's okay.
[110:02.98]It's okay.
[110:03.66]I've died from like 30 scouts since hitting F9.
[110:06.24]What's this warning for?
[110:09.09]I have like jello vision right now.
[110:11.47]Oh, okay.
[110:11.99]That is like kind of horrible to look at.
[110:13.25]Did you do something to me?
[110:14.47]No, I didn't do anything.
[110:15.37]Did you like give me drugs?
[110:16.78]What's going on?
[110:17.52]Oh my god, this is bad.
[110:20.24]This is bad.
[110:21.40]This is real bad.
[110:23.48]Seriously.
[110:26.12]Alright.
[110:27.77]Hey.
[110:29.13]Tell me when you respawn.
[110:30.59]You guys can have a comeback.
[110:31.85]TychoRC.
[110:38.18]Are you about to give me, like, 100% credits and no clips?
[110:42.08]You got really weak eyes.
[110:43.22]Are you respawned?
[110:44.14]I am spawned.
[110:44.98]I am spawned.
[110:45.82]Actually, I kind of do.
[110:46.46]Good luck.
[110:47.48]What is this thing?
[110:49.34]Oh, no.
[110:49.74]Do it again.
[110:50.14]I walked into, like, a friggin' resupply.
[110:53.07]What is going on?
[110:54.47]Oh.
[110:54.91]What does this thing mean?
[110:56.09]What are we talking about?
[110:57.03]What does this thing do?
[110:57.71]Oh, that title makes sense.
[110:59.01]Because I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[111:00.81]Oh, dear lord.
[111:02.69]Oh, boy.
[111:03.21]Oh, no.
[111:04.59]Oh!
[111:09.26]Still didn't even kill him.
[111:10.30]People are going to think I'm a legitimate hacker.
[111:14.20]I can't believe I got killed.
[111:15.18]That was unbelievably bad.
[111:19.48]Some pyro blew the rocket back.
[111:23.46]I went spy because I was going to try and kill you while you were like that.
[111:26.82]Dude, I died within 10 seconds of me having that thing.
[111:32.02]Alright, let's go.
[111:33.31]10 seconds.
[111:34.15]I don't know if I can trust you.
[111:35.91]Let me have it again.
[111:37.25]How do I know if I can trust you?
[111:39.73]Alright, this time I promise I'll make use of it.
[111:44.11]Mordhau.
[111:45.07]I thought it ticked damage on you.
[111:50.26]Because I don't play Battle Royales.
[111:52.16]I've played a Battle Royale like twice.
[111:53.86]Oh, I can't believe he's not one of these streamers that plays Battle Royale every day.
[112:00.50]What?
[112:03.35]I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle.
[112:05.95]I mean, this guy streams Battle Royales 5,000 hours.
[112:09.43]I can't believe you didn't know.
[112:11.45]I didn't know.
[112:19.78]It was just gray.
[112:21.78]I thought it was going to battlefield me and turn me around.
[112:26.04]You know when it goes like... Please get back to the playing field in five seconds.
[112:33.37]There was a battle royale.
[112:34.47]I forgot there was excuses.
[112:36.68]That's not an excuse.
[112:37.58]Hey, Etalyx, I did really well.
[112:44.54]I was killing people.
[112:45.44]I just walked out of the circle and died instantly.
[112:48.03]I don't think he's even going to call.
[112:50.79]He needs to know.
[112:51.79]How many times have I called him?
[112:53.87]You know what I'm getting realization here?
[112:56.23]Like, I'm going to call him.
[112:57.37]I'm going to call him.
[112:59.72]How many times have I called Etalyx?
[113:01.20]I'm calling him right now.
[113:02.26]Like, with a complaint about something.
[113:04.76]Yo.
[113:05.48]Probably has me muted.
[113:07.10]The Battle Royale circle thing instantly killed me.
[113:09.74]I was doing well.
[113:10.48]I was in the last six.
[113:12.92]Did you get, like, chased and you... Etalyx is just the friend that, like, if I have something I gotta fucking vent about... Answer the phone.
[113:21.40]I'm about to word dump soup on you.
[113:23.48]I don't play Battle Royales.
[113:29.18]Hold on, so you, like, you strolled casually into the fog?
[113:32.76]Is that what happened?
[113:33.26]And maybe it's because I'm afraid to do that to anybody else.
[113:35.66]I was doing so good, too.
[113:36.68]Like, okay, there are tons of people that I talk to on, like, a weekly basis, right?
[113:40.36]Like, whatever.
[113:41.60]Can you cue us, too?
[113:42.64]I don't do that to other people.
[113:44.38]I only, like, call Etalyx to let me, like, let me fucking tell you something.
[113:47.78]Can you understand what's going on here, Etalyx?
[113:50.04]Oops.
[113:51.41]Party.
[113:52.27]Home.
[113:53.29]Am I logged in?
[113:54.93]Probably not.
[113:57.21]Alright, maybe I can see you.
[113:58.31]Are you, like, in the game?
[113:59.75]Oh, there we go.
[114:00.29]I think I can just add you.
[114:03.99]Uh, what's your name?
[114:04.53]You know, actually, do that to, like, my mother, too.
[114:06.89]Stixon.
[114:07.43]I'll be like, Ma.
[114:08.07]Stixon.
[114:08.81]Listen to me.
[114:09.61]Do you understand, Ma?
[114:10.33]Like, Ma.
[114:11.83]And she'll be like, yeah, of course.
[114:13.39]Mm-hmm.
[114:14.27]Should've got it, right?
[114:17.73]Uh... Alright, well, Rance is already there.
[114:21.01]Anger is already there.
[114:23.21]I don't see you in the party list here.
[114:26.08]no no look at me which is that I got an invite but it's not actually like an accept invitation no naked can you join off me he's ignoring us I'm not ignoring more what what he has no friends because this game is you know this game is uh based on a true story written by dimitri 2033.
[114:53.06]This is back to back.
[114:53.80]Alright.
[114:54.68]Oh, do you guys remember this?
[114:55.66]Oh my god, I forgot about this stream.
[114:58.10]Oh boy.
[114:58.56]Um... I couldn't get past the tutorial in this game and I was fucking freaking out and livid.
[115:04.55]Are you okay?
[115:05.83]No, not right now.
[115:07.97]I'm fucking angry right now.
[115:09.47]Yeah, this is bad.
[115:10.43]This actually is really bad.
[115:11.13]Fighting against bad internet and now I'm fighting against, like, my streaming software being a piece of shit.
[115:17.83]Ugh, new game.
[115:18.67]Wait, no.
[115:20.15]You guys can see this, right?
[115:22.00]No, you're not.
[115:23.22]You guys can see this, right?
[115:24.50]You're not jaded.
[115:25.34]I just want to make sure that that's possible.
[115:27.14]You're a positive guy.
[115:28.52]You can see this?
[115:34.05]Okay, good.
[115:35.82]I couldn't get past the tutorial and it was pissing me off.
[115:38.02]I was playing on like the hardest difficulty because you gotta play on the fucking hardest difficulty because you're on stream.
[115:42.20]You're a streamer.
[115:42.92]If you don't play on hard, then everybody's gonna laugh at you and like blow snot rockets at you like on their screen.
[115:48.02]I'm gonna make my own fucking internet.
[115:51.05]I'm gonna make my own streaming software, my own internet in my own house.
[115:53.95]I'm gonna build my own house with my bare hands.
[115:56.17]Holy shit.
[116:00.46]Fuck this.
[116:00.88]I ain't, like, having somebody else have to, like, run my life.
[116:03.64]You know what I mean?
[116:04.08]I'm gonna build my own house.
[116:05.38]I'm gonna make my own bank.
[116:07.78]I'm gonna make my own bread.
[116:09.39]I'm gonna make my own milk.
[116:12.91]What the fuck am I talking about?
[116:14.17]Can we talk about that for a second, by the way?
[116:16.89]So, if you don't know, I was in a snowstorm.
[116:19.23]A pretty bad one.
[116:21.25]And... I don't know what it is with people.
[116:24.14]But for some reason... Why do people buy bread and milk?
[116:31.62]What's the bread and milk story there?
[116:33.16]Still, explain it to me.
[116:33.92]You go to a grocery store.
[116:34.66]It doesn't matter what grocery store you go to.
[116:35.98]Go to any grocery store before like a snowstorm or before like a hurricane or something.
[116:40.54]Especially like a snowstorm.
[116:41.44]I don't understand.
[116:42.41]You're going to eat a bunch of bread for like a day?
[116:45.87]I wouldn't eat bread.
[116:47.15]I won't be able to eat a loaf of bread in two days.
[116:50.91]Three days.
[116:51.39]Four days.
[116:53.01]Why do people... What, are you just chugging milk in your basement?
[116:55.77]Why do people buy bread and milk?
[116:57.26]Why don't you buy like food?
[116:58.94]What's going on there?
[117:02.60]To eat where you can eat a bunch of bread?
[117:04.20]Why wouldn't you get like a fucking a dozen Chef Boyardee cans?
[117:10.38]Like a jug of milk?
[117:11.03]It's only bread and milk.
[117:11.95]It's nothing else.
[117:19.13]You go to any other aisle in the grocery store and it's full.
[117:23.22]But people are gonna just slam, eat like loaves of bread and chug milk.
[117:29.68]I still don't get it.
[117:32.42]What the hell are you doing?
[117:37.60]Who the fuck drinks milk on a regular basis anyways?
[117:42.03]I'm glad we're getting away from this one.
[117:45.79]The thing.
[117:46.53]Oh god.
[117:47.99]I can just shit my pants now.
[117:50.49]I can just buy new pants and then buy a new chair and then buy a new floor.
[117:53.68]What?
[117:57.04]What the fuck?
[118:00.09]That was next level.
[118:01.67]Seriously.
[118:02.59]That's just been three in a row of me just fucking furious.
[118:06.18]Phylactery's still coming in with another 10,000 bits.
[118:11.32]The almighty dollar.
[118:17.34]I gotta move my hair.
[118:18.06]He's deranged.
[118:18.42]Thank you.
[118:29.94]What am I about to do?
[118:31.59]Holy fuck.
[118:38.17]Oh, this is a nine and a half hour stream.
[118:39.95]Jesus.
[118:40.53]New top.
[118:41.43]Yeah.
[118:42.64]I can't even look over there.
[118:43.90]That's an insane amount of money.
[118:46.70]Oh, this is when.
[118:47.32]Yeah.
[118:47.46]Alright.
[118:48.38]I'm going to be.
[118:48.80]I'm vetoing this one.
[118:50.07]Time for some free samples from Trader Joe's.
[118:53.07]That's right.
[118:53.53]We're going to go in there and go.
[118:54.45]We're going to go around the mall and get like the free samples from all the food court places.
[118:59.34]I want to veto this because I'm going to talk about like people are subbing.
[119:02.04]And I don't want anyone to sub.
[119:04.88]Don't sub right now.
[119:05.98]Even if it's for a joke.
[119:06.90]I'm speechless.
[119:09.20]I have no idea what to say.
[119:13.54]Thanks for the fucking crazy amount of money.
[119:16.67]You guys are awesome.
[119:17.39]Yeah, this goes on for like 10 minutes, I remember.
[119:19.16]I'm vetoing it.
[119:19.50]I'm going to try to beat this video game.
[119:21.54]Veto.
[119:23.02]I mean, this is one of my favorite streams ever.
[119:24.56]Link the jermaMustard website.
[119:26.48]It's going to be crashed.
[119:27.98]Alright, where do I need to go?
[119:29.30]I got to go plant the C4 on the hangars, which is upstairs, right?
[119:34.01]Ban people that sub.
[119:37.55]Which way do I go?
[119:38.25]From here?
[119:45.60]I think we're over it.
[119:46.68]I think it just happened like five minutes ago.
[119:50.04]And this is the post reaction, right?
[120:00.91]I remember having one health at some point.
[120:02.79]This whole game was a mess.
[120:07.23]Is he dead?
[120:08.99]I think I need him, don't I?
[120:10.37]What are you doing?
[120:11.56]I had like a clenched teeth, clenched ass this entire time I played this game.
[120:20.50]This, uh, gap... The guy's like dead.
[120:25.30]You actually just did that.
[120:27.22]I need this guy, so I'm gonna heal him.
[120:28.71]But what are you hiding behind the door?
[120:30.41]Alright, ten seconds, let's go.
[120:36.01]Okay, let's keep going.
[120:41.99]Anything else in here that I can grab?
[120:45.34]I got a shave, man.
[120:46.04]I look young.
[120:46.96]Little rift area thing.
[120:48.28]Orcs Must Die impressions?
[120:50.66]But this thing right here has to be protected, and these doors over here, if you look in the top right of the screen, this door is going to open, and this door down here is going to open as well.
[120:59.74]What's going to happen is orcs, hundreds and hundreds of orcs are going to pour out of those places, and you have to defend them.
[121:07.47]You have to kill them all.
[121:09.65]or else they're going to take that over.
[121:11.05]Back when YouTuber also automatically meant journalist.
[121:14.13]One way is with your crossbow and you can shoot it like this.
[121:17.27]It has a couple of little features too.
[121:18.91]You can do like a stun or stuns in place.
[121:20.05]I don't know why we all thought that.
[121:21.65]But the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is because you have all these things you can put down
[121:28.01]So I have started to upgrade, or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap, and I use the super boom barrel, but I'm not going to use that right now because I'm going to use the arrow wall.
[121:38.06]As you can see, customization is really, really interesting in this game, and look at how many spells you're going to actually end up getting.
[121:44.56]It's a whole lot of fun, and as you'll see, what I'm going to do here is play... Oh, it's going to sink!
[121:49.48]Is he trying to kill me?
[121:56.70]I remember this game.
[122:04.10]Alright.
[122:05.74]I get it now.
[122:06.70]America's Funniest Home Videos?
[122:10.58]Oh yeah.
[122:15.63]I played this for three hours?
[122:17.73]Can you hear the fucking furious tapping?
[122:20.72]Dodge, right?
[122:21.20]How do I dodge?
[122:25.82]You just saw this one.
[122:29.04]This game is really fun.
[122:29.98]I want more games like this that are just fun and funny.
[122:33.84]I don't care if they're like 60 plus hour experiences, 100 hour experiences.
[122:39.16]I would gladly pay $40 to $60 for a game that even if I get three to six, whatever, four to six hours of enjoyment from it,
[122:48.70]I just want a game that's fun though.
[122:51.61]I don't have to have like a legend on a mini map with like 15 different keys on the legend.
[122:59.13]You know what I mean?
[122:59.65]Like, oh, there's like the turn in.
[123:01.21]There's like the side quest.
[123:02.45]There's the collection.
[123:03.19]There's the other collection.
[123:04.71]There's the side mission for the collection.
[123:07.40]I don't care.
[123:08.70]It's going to be a fun game.
[123:10.32]I'll pay the money.
[123:15.73]That's a number 98 opinion.
[123:18.39]I can't go forward.
[123:19.29]I can't go left or right.
[123:21.39]Maybe that's scripted?
[123:28.18]Talk shit.
[123:28.90]Talk shit.
[123:29.60]Talk shit.
[123:30.28]Why are you chanting that?
[123:36.08]It's like he's chanting in the back.
[123:37.72]Just like, come on, talk more shit.
[123:41.99]Talk, shit, talk.
[123:42.86]Alright.
[123:45.70]Alright, okay.
[123:46.84]Yeah, I hear you.
[123:49.36]Okay.
[123:51.16]I think that if you make a game that's even two to three hours long but has some replayability and shareability.
[124:00.09]Think about that.
[124:00.95]You want to share this kind of shit?
[124:02.47]Like, let's say it's only like a four or five hour game.
[124:05.85]Your ability to want other people to enjoy it is another reason to pay the money.
[124:13.69]I cannot tell you the last time, and I fucking mean this, the last time that I paid for a AAA game and I wanted somebody else to play it too.
[124:24.86]I like wanted to share it with somebody.
[124:26.68]Nope.
[124:27.66]Has not happened in a very, very long time.
[124:30.97]You play some of these AAA games that are like 60 bucks and you just want to forget they existed.
[124:35.99]You enjoy them for like a couple hours and you forget they exist.
[124:39.94]I want to be able to tell everybody about this shit.
[124:41.84]Like remember Stardew Valley?
[124:42.74]You remember like telling everybody how fun Stardew Valley was and you gotta fucking play it.
[124:46.92]You gotta play it.
[124:47.71]That doesn't happen.
[124:49.27]$60 is worth it to me if I can share it with people.
[124:57.01]That's a Reddit take.
[124:59.09]You just maybe stubbed my toe.
[125:03.60]I just stubbed my toe right here.
[125:05.54]And that's your fault and I want you banned for at least 10 seconds.
[125:12.41]I can probably try to... What is this game?
[125:14.47]Clone Drone in the Dangerous.
[125:16.00]Oh, I remember this.
[125:16.44]This is actually kind of fun.
[125:22.54]I think I was playing with people in the chat, wasn't I?
[125:24.14]Yeah, it's like a lightsaber robot game.
[125:32.89]Watch out for the train.
[125:42.88]Oh!
[125:43.48]Wanting to connect with other people is the least Reddit take.
[125:49.25]Uh-oh, spikes.
[125:50.43]Oh, I just got dunked on.
[125:51.79]Holy shit, that was bad.
[125:53.41]Alright, now I know what I'm doing.
[125:55.93]I got slammed dunked on.
[125:57.85]I'm going with the hammer here.
[125:58.63]I probably should have done armor, but I got another chance here.
[126:05.00]Where is he?
[126:05.46]Up there?
[126:06.23]Games, for me, are all about being able to, like, want to play them, to show them to people.
[126:12.85]That was one of the reasons for, like, the original YouTube channel.
[126:16.33]We actually are doing a chase game.
[126:17.57]I wanted to show people something because I thought it was really cool and fun.
[126:20.65]Like, I really liked it, right?
[126:23.57]Oh, shit.
[126:24.77]Oh, shit.
[126:27.57]If I can't be confident to tell you how much I want to, like, share an experience with you or, like, tell you that you should try something... Alright, here we go.
[126:36.76]Huge hammer.
[126:37.98]And armor.
[126:39.92]See if we can't sail the deal here.
[126:41.77]Or he might sail the deal.
[126:42.49]He wanted to show people how to backstab as a spy.
[126:44.53]Well, because spy was literally my favorite thing in the world.
[126:46.11]That was like my favorite thing ever.
[126:49.49]Jerma's reddit take.
[126:50.44]Holy shit, that was sick.
[126:51.24]This game looks good.
[126:52.56]This game actually looks pretty fun.
[127:01.95]Smogged.
[127:02.43]Yeah, get smogged.
[127:04.23]Good game, dude.
[127:04.91]Seriously, that was a ton of fun.
[127:06.04]Alright, this will be the last one.
[127:07.48]I'm going to take a piss break and come back and we'll do challenge mode.
[127:16.16]You say it like you haven't played it before.
[127:18.92]I don't know.
[127:20.72]I forget everything.
[127:24.81]I don't remember anything that I ever do.
[127:26.47]Ever.
[127:27.55]That's why these streams are so weird to me.
[127:30.65]I don't remember saying any of these words.
[127:37.94]What's this game called?
[127:39.06]This game is Clone Drone in the Danger Zone.
[127:42.64]I'm going to go in aggressive.
[127:45.43]I think we're gonna get into the BRB, though, after this next one.
[127:47.87]Unless I veto it.
[127:48.83]For this experiment to work, we've gotta win three times.
[127:53.88]We did once.
[127:54.82]Not more.
[127:55.16]A lot of TF2.
[127:55.60]We can do it again.
[127:56.96]Ooh, gotcha.
[127:59.70]Oh, I can't do that shit anymore.
[128:01.04]Ooh, gotcha.
[128:03.35]This is gonna be a second win.
[128:04.51]This is gonna be a second win.
[128:05.29]I can't do shit like that.
[128:06.71]Alright, this is win number two.
[128:08.53]And I don't even need to make an edit, I don't think.
[128:10.95]Because that was, like, two seconds.
[128:14.44]So we can just keep talking about, like, I don't know, the weather.
[128:17.52]Jax, no.
[128:17.88]It's got a dead sunny out right now.
[128:19.28]Overcast right now.
[128:20.82]It ain't bad.
[128:21.50]Edit Andy.
[128:22.48]It ain't very good either.
[128:23.40]Blast from the past.
[128:24.01]What is this about?
[128:24.65]Well, I know how to play Territory Control.
[128:27.27]Don't worry.
[128:27.97]I've played it before, Val.
[128:28.95]Hydro?
[128:29.41]Let's do it again.
[128:31.39]Oh, it is Hydro.
[128:31.95]In the same, like, two minutes, let's get the third victory on Hydro.
[128:36.95]And then I can go eat, like, a banana.
[128:39.17]Right.
[128:39.47]I think I had to do this on my server because nobody played this.
[128:42.63]So, like, why not, right?
[128:43.85]Why wouldn't you eat a bunch of bananas?
[128:45.21]Why are there this many people in this one tunnel?
[128:48.33]That's right.
[128:49.61]This is like... We're gonna win.
[128:51.83]Did we get a bingo?
[128:52.79]You got one.
[128:54.13]I'll show you the updated card.
[128:55.55]I didn't do anything.
[128:56.29]I didn't do anything.
[128:57.85]Still looking for a boomer?
[128:59.13]Still looking for a Jex moment?
[129:02.77]Naked?
[129:03.07]Dude, what?
[129:06.30]Uh...
[129:07.73]Who played hydro? Uh, I mean, some people did.
[129:09.00]Let's do it again, third time's a charm let's go.
[129:14.00]You've only been naked three times. I've been naked-
[129:16.00]No, not- no edits. We're not doing any editing right now. I wanna- I wanna see for myself if it's possible to get a trifecta on hydro in less than like 4 or 5 minutes.
[129:20.00]I've been naked if it's possible four or five hundred times on stream. I've been naked probably-
[129:26.00]Okay, how many how many streams have I ever done? A thousand?
[129:31.00]I've streamed about a thousand times.
[129:35.45]I've been naked seven or eight hundred of those times.
[129:40.10]I'm just not on camera.
[129:41.94]How did we just win the game?
[129:46.10]It's just chaos.
[129:47.70]Well, not naked, like with no clothes on, but like no shirt or like shirt.
[129:55.27]And you know what?
[129:56.05]I'm not.
[129:56.73]I need to shut the fuck up right now.
[129:59.41]Things are just happening.
[130:00.61]I'm going to get myself in trouble.
[130:01.45]I need to shut up.
[130:02.31]And we're going to win.
[130:03.87]Quiet.
[130:04.39]Yeah.
[130:06.13]Stand up right now.
[130:07.11]You did it.
[130:07.83]No.
[130:09.35]You won.
[130:09.97]Alright.
[130:12.11]We got to the end of this video.
[130:13.17]I'm going to pause it.
[130:13.87]I'm going to take a beer.
[130:14.39]I'm going to go pee.
[130:18.57]Why would I ever turn a webcam on if I didn't have pants or underwear on?
[130:24.29]Are you guys out of your mind?
[130:26.80]The risk?
[130:27.44]I told you about the dream that I had that time.
[130:30.37]That's a reality for me.
[130:32.29]I had a dream one time, for those of you that are new, where I was sitting here talking, and I stood up for a second, and I was naked.
[130:41.50]And for a tiny little frame, like, okay, this is weird.
[130:45.48]I mean, you clicked a mature audience warning.
[130:47.36]I don't give a shit.
[130:48.62]For, like, one little frame, my, like, my dick was on camera.
[130:52.91]For, like, a... Stop it.
[130:54.99]Stop talking.
[130:56.95]For, like, a... It was, like, a little... Like, a tenth of a second frame.
[131:02.05]And... Like, nobody said anything.
[131:05.64]I looked over at the chat.
[131:07.08]And it was, like, I realized what had happened.
[131:08.56]I was, like, holy shit.
[131:09.40]I think, like, my dick was just on camera.
[131:11.14]My, like, balls were on camera.
[131:12.78]But nobody was saying anything.
[131:14.18]And you know for a fact that if that happened in real life, it would be...
[131:19.09]Dick! Dick! Dick! I can see his dick! Dick! Dick!
[131:20.00]You know what I mean? That's all it would be.
[131:23.00]So I didn't see that.
[131:24.00]So I was sitting there going: Holy shit, did nobody see that?
[131:25.00]I like but I can't even address it.
[131:27.00]I have to like delete the VOD but if I delete the VOD wouldn't that be like kind of suspicious?
[131:32.00]I was like how did nobody see that?
[131:34.00]So I was like freaking out about it I was like: Fuck man, I think people saw that.
[131:37.00]And then I woke up.
[131:38.00]So I've had that dream before where it was like: Okay, ready?
[131:41.00]Like, I stood up for a second, I like stretched my back and we're talking like right... like dick right here.
[131:49.67]Like, just right... Just... And I... It was like, holy fuck.
[131:54.24]I think my camera was small enough where I don't think anybody caught it, right?
[131:56.86]Alright, I'll be right back.
[131:59.69]I'm gonna pee.
[132:00.53]I'll see you in a minute.
[132:21.37]Thank you.
[135:20.50]Okay, what's happening?
[135:24.38]Also, by the way, just to make sure everybody's aware, as of probably next weekend,
[135:32.32]Nominations are going to open up for the best and worst award show.
[135:42.49]Start to get the categories ready.
[135:44.73]It'll be in the Discord.
[135:51.20]The Dollhouse is going to auto-win every category.
[135:54.52]Well, I'm thinking of potentially just graying out the Dollhouse.
[136:03.11]Because we'll end up with the Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King.
[136:07.02]Where it wins every category at the Oscars.
[136:18.72]Have it be its own category.
[136:20.36]Yeah, that makes sense.
[136:28.79]So instead, we'll only have four streams to choose from.
[136:31.43]What?! !
[136:34.42]What do you mean four streams?
[136:37.98]It should be a moment from that stream.
[136:39.86]Yeah, that... I'll get some good categories.
[136:42.46]There are only four... Okay.
[136:57.73]And stop the music.
[136:59.19]Sorry, that's probably jarring for a lot of you.
[137:00.35]I apologize.
[137:02.50]we're coming back we're going to do how long they're gonna uh we're gonna click it again because we need to kind of recalibrate here it is currently there are 40 more minutes remaining uh I'll add another I'll add 10 more minutes so there's 50 is an hour we'll just call it an hour because the brbs for you to get any more bingos
[137:23.03]What's the BRB music from?
[137:25.03]That is from Blordow, an incredibly talented individual.
[137:29.83]He's made all the music, pretty much, for this channel.
[137:32.03]All the art.
[137:32.59]Literally, the BRB screen you're looking at right now was made by Blordow.
[137:36.64]Oh, by the way, let's talk about this for a second.
[137:40.68]Blordow is currently, we talked a day or so ago, Blordow is making four new BRB screens, and they're going to be seasonal, which, holy PogChamp, right?
[137:53.83]Four new BRB screens.
[137:55.70]And I just kind of told him.
[137:57.86]More music.
[137:59.70]He's going to make a bunch more tracks.
[138:01.74]We're going to get more Blordow music.
[138:03.64]At least probably four or five more.
[138:08.92]I'm telling you.
[138:10.52]Let me be the first to tell you.
[138:13.40]When Blordow eventually gets hired.
[138:16.04]For doing like a fucking.
[138:17.90]Game soundtrack of the year.
[138:19.32]Like whatever.
[138:19.95]Whenever it is.
[138:20.41]Because it's going to happen.
[138:22.91]I just.
[138:25.70]We knew first.
[138:27.44]We knew here first, right?
[138:30.32]We knew first.
[138:34.00]It's going to be so awesome to be like a Blordow hipster when he wins fucking game soundtrack of the year in like five years.
[138:45.86]I liked him.
[138:46.56]I knew it.
[138:46.90]And I liked his music before you did.
[138:54.44]I'm excited to see what he makes.
[138:59.57]You're going to be gatekeeping.
[139:02.25]I'm just kidding.
[139:02.89]I'm not going to do that.
[139:11.85]You can't.
[139:12.21]The world is ending in 2022.
[139:13.17]That's
[139:28.66]Why are you saying that?
[139:36.54]Why do you say that?
[139:37.11]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[139:44.75]You have a setting selected that makes YouTube videos come up much more often.
[139:52.28]It's part of the site.
[139:53.86]I wanted to make sure that YouTube videos had an equal chance to show up.
[139:57.58]It still is, I think, like 25% chance, though.
[140:00.64]Because last time, last time we did this, I just was doing the random, and it was like 2% chance to get a video.
[140:09.47]So now what it does, I believe, is it picks the video file first, and then picks a timestamp.
[140:16.75]That's kind of how I imagined it now.
[140:20.85]So, I think before it just picked, like, a timestamp.
[140:24.51]Now it picks a video file, then the timestamp.
[140:27.31]So, that's not rigged.
[140:29.59]That's exactly how it probably should be.
[140:30.95]Are you gonna stream Elden Ring?
[140:37.63]Now fuck that game.
[140:41.85]Alright, um, let's go.
[140:45.29]Let's go.
[140:49.64]Of course I am.
[140:51.46]I can't fucking contain my excitement for that game.
[140:54.28]Alright, let's put the timer back on.
[140:58.98]Here we go.
[141:00.67]Let's just remind everybody about the bingo card that currently stands.
[141:10.53]I don't think it's going to happen again.
[141:15.07]Going over these?
[141:15.79]No.
[141:15.85]No.
[141:19.16]You need a significant moment for some of these to happen.
[141:28.76]Who's your favorite Game of Thrones character?
[141:30.06]Varys.
[141:30.36]I don't even know why I answered that.
[141:32.12]That show is fucking complete.
[141:33.34]No one cares about that anymore.
[141:38.80]Didn't HBO come out with the trailer for the new series they were going to do and it had four likes on Twitter?
[141:45.04]I got, like, retweeted, like, eight times.
[141:47.51]I don't even remember.
[141:48.15]Something like that.
[141:48.63]I don't even remember.
[141:56.25]Stop pretending?
[141:57.19]Pretending about what my favorite character is?
[142:00.88]Do you want to know something funny?
[142:03.34]Okay.
[142:04.14]This is a confession.
[142:04.88]We're going to do confessional right now.
[142:07.42]The amount of... Okay.
[142:08.48]The amount of times that I've watched... And I don't even know why I still do this, but I just do.
[142:14.43]The amount of times that I've watched the Varus... Okay, hold on.
[142:17.54]These are spoilers for Game of Thrones.
[142:19.50]Spoilers for Game of Thrones, the series.
[142:22.02]I'm just going to tell you.
[142:22.82]Okay, here we go.
[142:23.38]Here it comes.
[142:24.50]If you don't want to hear a spoiler, why?
[142:25.54]Who cares?
[142:26.10]The show's over.
[142:28.49]Varus visiting Ned in the dungeon.
[142:31.27]Both times.
[142:33.59]I've probably watched collectively, and I'm not kidding.
[142:36.11]I'm being desperately, completely truthful with you.
[142:39.84]I've watched that scene on YouTube.
[142:43.95]Probably four or five hundred times.
[142:47.19]Total.
[142:48.31]Over the last five plus years.
[142:51.67]I don't even know why.
[142:52.29]I just get... I know every single line by heart.
[142:55.09]I know the whole thing.
[142:55.75]I don't even know why.
[142:56.45]I just like it.
[142:57.57]I like that scene.
[142:58.45]I don't know why.
[142:58.89]I swear to God it's been four or five hundred times.
[143:06.78]You quote it all the time.
[143:09.06]I believe.
[143:10.22]I'm telling you.
[143:12.60]Recite it.
[143:22.37]Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
[143:26.31]Merus?
[143:27.49]No, I'm not doing this!
[143:28.52]No, I'm not doing this!
[143:37.79]Oh, no, not so much, my lord.
[143:40.29]Men have been known to die of thirst in these halls.
[143:43.51]Hide it.
[143:44.31]Push it away.
[143:55.87]Keep going?
[143:56.33]I don't think I can.
[144:00.32]Let me see if I can actually do this.
[144:07.24]I've seen 500, but I'm like on the spot and I'm kind of nervous.
[144:10.58]I don't want to do this.
[144:11.44]And then it goes, okay, men have been noticed in these halls.
[144:19.60]I'm going to mix them together, but who cares?
[144:23.51]What madness has led you to tell the queen the truth of Joffrey's birth?
[144:29.12]Madness of mercy.
[144:31.24]As you might say for children.
[144:35.36]Mercy.
[144:36.32]I'm done.

[144:50.94]Hold on.
[144:52.06]Am I going to get sued if I dub this?
[144:59.81]If I can see it, I can do it.
[145:01.75]And I'm not kidding.
[145:06.15]No, no, no.

[146:55.50]Oh, man.
[146:55.94]This is an opportunity for another 200 community subs.
[147:01.20]I think I know what happened tonight.
[147:03.18]So, like, the TV bit brought us up to an 11.
[147:06.69]And then I played this fucking boring game.
[147:09.09]And it brought us down to, like, a 4.
[147:11.19]So, I think I understand what happened here.
[147:15.46]We started off at an 11 and we came down to like a three and a half.
[147:18.76]What, like energy wise?
[147:20.06]I'm a vampire.
[147:26.20]I remember that was... That was like a really hyped up game, wasn't it, from what I remember?
[147:30.45]Admits it was boring.
[147:31.31]I'm not... I don't think that.
[147:33.47]I forget what the story with that was.
[147:35.93]At the opening credits, the huge fight scene happens.
[147:39.88]And, you know, Jackie Chan is taking on like 30 people.
[147:43.22]It's the new Jackie Chan movie.
[147:44.68]Credits open.
[147:45.72]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[147:47.56]Through the... Guy brings a ladder up.
[147:49.58]He dives through the ladder.
[147:50.86]Hits the guy in the face.
[147:51.89]Swings the ladder around.
[147:52.85]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[147:53.75]Four guys around go flying through windows.
[147:55.97]Explosions everywhere.
[147:57.53]And then the rest of the movie is Jackie Chan at a desk writing letters for an hour.
[148:05.54]That's the rest of the movie.
[148:06.92]That's what happened today.
[148:07.66]That's what this movie was.
[148:10.70]That's what happened.
[148:14.47]nice elevator pitch for your show or movie he was writing his Christmas cards for the rest of the movie for three hours alright we're looking for well I'm not looking for this because okay naked jex it has to be a real jex moment under these moments the movie was too interesting in the first like 12 minutes and then I was writing Christmas cards for four hours
[148:44.43]Alright, 20 seconds, let's go.
[148:47.09]What the fuck is he saying?
[148:47.81]Okay, let me translate.
[148:49.93]The game was exciting for the first 10 minutes, and then it was terrible and boring for the next two hours.
[148:55.54]Lenny face?
[148:58.84]What the fuck?
[148:59.70]That's old.
[149:00.68]That's very old.

[149:03.89]Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[149:06.85]Oh, an exit.
[149:07.67]An exit.

[149:11.51]Yeah, what you got on me?
[149:12.43]Nothing.
[149:13.15]You prick.
[149:15.99]Oh, ha ha.
[149:16.77]If this ha ha oh god in the title, this is bad.
[149:21.01]Ouch.
[149:28.87]I had no idea how this game even worked.
[149:30.83]And I thought it was terrible.
[149:31.69]I thought this game was awful.
[149:33.42]I didn't even pay attention to any of that.
[149:35.79]I was too busy laughing at my, like, stupid jump.
[149:38.01]Yes, I'll do it, sure.
[149:40.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[149:46.75]Yeah, screw your family.

[149:56.72]Oh, I didn't know you could do that!
[149:58.18]I didn't know you could do that!
[149:59.28]What?
[150:00.63]Oh no!
[150:02.37]Was I not supposed to do that?
[150:03.63]Hog face, no.

[150:09.56]Wield right weapon two-handed.
[150:13.00]Oh, I can use this as a two-hander?
[150:14.84]Oh, great!
[150:15.34]Yeah, let me use it.
[150:16.26]Get, dude!
[150:17.04]Dark Souls is a series where you have to unplug your head from the Matrix to understand even why people play it.
[150:21.67]I'm fighting in a stupid hallway!
[150:23.49]I can't even swing my sword.
[150:24.89]Get...
[150:27.61]Back in like 2012, 2013.
[150:28.27]You are so annoying.
[150:30.68]I should have just gotten rid of you when I had the chance.
[150:32.18]This was not as popular as it is now.
[150:34.70]Back in like 2010, 2011.
[150:35.98]This is the lamest fight ever.
[150:39.01]No, don't kill me.
[150:40.27]This was just like, why the fuck do people like this?
[150:42.73]I don't even understand.
[150:43.31]This game sucks.
[150:43.79]Where's the bonfire?
[150:45.21]I didn't even get it.
[150:46.31]Like, I was like, why did I die so easily?
[150:49.55]Like, what's... I have to start over again?
[150:52.67]Like, this was... I thought this was stupid when I first played it.
[150:57.00]I had to pull the cord out of the back of my head and go, wait a minute, this is incredible.
[151:00.82]I have to play this.
[151:02.28]It took like a year after this video.
[151:05.24]Not gonna be an idiot.
[151:07.25]Oh, that does so much more damage.
[151:09.07]I had the exact same experience.
[151:10.71]Yeah.
[151:12.06]I want to know the actual statistic of people that played Dark Souls when it first came out, or Demon's Souls, said, I don't get it, and then came back two years later and played it again.
[151:22.98]And was like, holy shit, this is my favorite game ever made.
[151:25.64]It's probably a shitload of you.
[151:32.90]What does that even do?
[151:33.64]I can't even do it.

[153:18.97]Yeah, well I got like a bunch of fucking chest and back problems.
[153:24.45]Hey, hey, hey, Jerma from like four years ago, thanks for the fucking curse.
[153:30.18]Take it off.
[153:33.24]Take it off.
[153:36.19]I know there's a fucking goddamn goblin or like genie or something watching this right now that put that curse on.
[153:41.83]And you're sitting there going like, oh, yes.
[153:45.07]Take it off now.
[153:46.64]Take it off.
[153:53.75]We're still good.
[153:55.27]Goblins aren't real.
[153:56.17]Yes, they are.
[154:05.46]You best start believing in ghost stories.
[154:08.49]Because I'm a... I am a goblin.
[154:10.33]That's... whatever.
[154:11.75]Fuck off.
[154:13.15]That's so rude.
[154:23.80]So rude.
[154:25.90]It was just a joke, everybody.
[154:28.03]Relax.
[154:30.23]I'm kidding.
[154:30.85]Oh, my God.
[154:31.65]I'm kidding.
[154:35.79]Is Santa real?
[154:36.63]Yes.
[154:37.31]Who else puts the presents under my tree?
[154:38.77]What was I going to say?
[154:39.39]It's like my mom and dad?
[154:40.55]Okay.
[154:45.03]Let's go.
[154:45.43]I got a ninth.
[154:47.07]You know what?
[154:47.43]Let's just leave it on.
[154:52.37]Whatever.
[154:54.55]What's next?
[154:58.23]Overused Santa joke?
[154:59.23]I mean, it's like getting to the holiday season.
[155:04.40]They're in style right now.
[155:07.16]Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission.
[155:09.52]No, not that one.
[155:10.28]The one after that one.
[155:11.12]Because the corridor mission is stupid.
[155:12.46]Earth Defense Force 5.
[155:13.16]What kind of support equipment do we eventually get?
[155:16.27]I wonder if I call Etalyx in this stream.
[155:18.27]And he's in it.
[155:18.73]I don't know.
[155:20.41]I don't remember them having support.
[155:27.09]I don't recall.
[155:27.75]Alright.
[155:29.34]Let's try the bolt gun.
[155:31.82]Oh, okay.
[155:32.80]You're hurting me.
[155:34.16]I am?
[155:34.46]Oh, this guy... EDF teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated weapons get upgraded.
[155:40.50]So I guess if you find the same weapon again... This game was so much fun.
[155:44.00]That's cool.
[155:46.16]I remember we were going to play this a shitload.
[155:49.25]And we just never did ever again.
[155:52.17]This thing is actually really great.
[155:55.61]It's a great single target weapon.
[155:56.57]Didn't they come up with another one?
[155:58.35]But it wasn't EDF, it was like EDF.
[156:00.21]Dragonlance was a good choice.
[156:01.43]Whoever suggested it, thanks for the suggestion.
[156:03.07]I don't even know what it is.
[156:03.89]It wasn't a numbered one.
[156:04.65]It doesn't go that far though.
[156:07.53]What's the new one?
[156:08.79]EDF 6 is coming out?
[156:10.93]Well, we're going to have to play it.
[156:14.15]Three new ones?
[156:15.15]Holy shit.
[156:17.61]I love these games.
[156:18.69]It's just shoot shit.
[156:21.55]Iron Rain sucked.
[156:22.55]That's what I'm thinking of.
[156:23.77]I'm not seeing very many crates.
[156:25.13]It was made by a different studio, right?
[156:26.43]It's so slow.
[156:27.47]These are so heavy.
[156:31.04]Wait, what?
[156:31.58]It says there's one right here.
[156:32.46]I'm doing this because I look tiny.
[156:36.16]If I don't frame myself correctly, I look really small.
[156:39.38]If I frame myself like this, I'm fucking huge jacked.
[156:42.32]I'm like handsome and shit.
[156:43.32]You know what I mean?
[156:45.62]Six would be good.
[156:46.20]Alright.
[156:48.72]This definitely doesn't feel harder.
[156:55.86]Crap.
[156:57.48]This is just playing the game.
[157:02.96]What happened to you being jacked?
[157:06.30]I mean, I was in the gym four or five days a week.
[157:10.31]That's what happened.
[157:10.81]I stopped doing that.
[157:12.97]I got kind of a mystery illness.
[157:15.87]Made it hard to really do stuff like that anymore.
[157:20.34]Now I just eat food.
[157:22.42]I'd rather just use the other lightning gun.
[157:27.83]I missed the 500 sub celebration video.
[157:31.07]30 more seconds.
[157:31.89]Chunky Andy.
[157:32.51]Alright, here we go.
[157:34.77]You've got about 30 minutes to fill the rest of those slots.
[157:50.13]It's so hard to aim.
[157:52.17]Yeah.
[157:52.83]You don't see it anywhere to buy?
[157:54.17]Yeah.
[157:54.47]For some weird reason, this game is not featured anywhere on the PlayStation Store.
[157:57.69]You have to go looking for it.
[157:58.43]No, you have to, like, look for it.
[158:00.00]What's up, man?
[158:00.28]You have to, like, purposefully search it.
[158:03.30]Oh, God.
[158:03.70]In 2018, you have to search it.
[158:05.20]Should I explain what we're doing again?
[158:06.40]I think I've done it a few times.
[158:17.38]Man, that was crazy.
[158:18.58]I can't believe that just happened.
[158:22.18]I hope it doesn't happen again.
[158:26.98]Protect me, my BS.
[158:30.62]Protect me.
[158:31.38]Where are they going?
[158:34.28]They don't have any weapons.
[158:36.90]They don't even know where they're going.
[158:38.62]Oh my god.
[158:42.67]They're awful!
[158:44.45]They're not even attacking anything, they're just running!
[158:48.93]You guys suck!
[158:51.85]Come on, do something!
[158:54.88]Somebody do something!
[158:57.14]Is this a classic?
[158:58.10]A classic comedy?
[158:59.06]This guy's like... Get him!
[159:02.24]Get him, Bia!
[159:02.88]This is a shorter video than I thought it was.
[159:04.38]Yeah, you wanna fuck with the Bias?
[159:06.70]Who gave you the fuck?
[159:08.80]This goes out to the brokenhearted.
[159:12.36]We already have singing on there.
[159:14.68]Don't worry.
[159:16.83]It's my life.
[159:19.17]And it's now or never.
[159:22.77]I don't want to live forever.
[159:25.73]Not bad.
[159:26.15]He hasn't talked this whole time.
[159:33.45]I died with God mode on.
[159:37.18]I have no control over my character.
[159:38.86]I'm just on fire.
[159:42.88]How are you going?
[159:47.42]It's a dinosaur!
[159:49.79]What?
[159:50.11]It's a dinosaur!
[159:51.51]Wait, there's a dinosaur?
[159:53.47]Yes!
[159:54.29]What the fuck?
[159:55.45]Oh, he has like a gun up there?
[160:03.40]I forgot about this.
[160:10.65]Oh, man.
[160:12.81]Back in the day, when I remember Ster used to hit me up and say, hey, I downloaded too many mods and my computer crashed.
[160:22.69]Would you like to play GTA?
[160:23.72]I was like, yeah, sure, of course.
[160:29.23]All these videos of all the weird mods and all, like, just the asset replacements, the character replacements.
[160:36.69]GTA 4, I think, is my favorite GTA, probably, out of all of them.
[160:42.42]But I can't ever go back and play it ever again.
[160:46.42]It's... It's... I can't.
[160:49.26]I'm just imagining a car flying by and like an elephant and a giraffe falling out with parachutes on.
[160:54.66]And like 500 explosions going on behind me and like I can't die and shit.
[160:58.74]Like I can't play it anymore.
[161:00.48]I have over modded to the point where I can't even enjoy it.
[161:03.73]Same thing with Skyrim.
[161:08.49]You wanna play a character I've never played before and like know how to play this fucking game?
[161:11.75]Like this character?
[161:13.69]You got another complaint stream.
[161:14.75]That's too much pressure.
[161:22.40]I hated this game too.
[161:25.02]I really hated this and I didn't want to say I hated it because I knew a lot of people liked it and I didn't want to be like the contradicting Andy.
[161:33.42]What?
[161:33.58]And everybody would be like, oh, you fucking just suck at it.
[161:36.30]Like, I hated this.
[161:38.56]Actually, this is great.
[161:39.30]Can I go back like years later so I can tell you what I was really thinking?
[161:42.74]I hated this game.
[161:44.08]Yes, you casual.
[161:46.46]Ban that guy for life.
[161:47.54]For real.
[161:48.00]Like, give that guy the first real full full ban that I've ever given.
[161:53.09]Ban that guy fucking fu- I don't want to ever see that guy again.
[161:57.13]Damn.
[162:02.21]I hate this game.
[162:03.54]I really do.
[162:03.90]You know, just turn the chat off.
[162:05.46]I don't want to know.
[162:06.98]Turn off the chat.
[162:08.60]We were doing two v2s and we were getting destroyed.
[162:10.76]No Ster was like carrying hard and I was dying and getting mad I don't do that.
[162:15.18]I'm kidding.
[162:16.34]I'm curious.
[162:17.16]How does it play out?
[162:22.03]Get shield bad
[162:41.66]Shield is broken.
[162:42.60]Shield guy's broken.
[162:45.04]Still?
[162:45.28]Holy, should you hear that exhale?
[162:49.15]Oh my god.
[162:55.83]Is this game still servers?
[162:57.63]Is this server still live or is this like Wii shopped?
[163:00.89]Is this game still live?
[163:06.79]I'm gonna beat this guy.
[163:16.08]You got revenge.
[163:16.86]Oh, man.
[163:17.24]I thought I fucking killed him.
[163:19.75]Hold on.
[163:20.13]I fucking brought that guy's health to zero.
[163:22.69]You can cancel out of literally anything with revenge mode.
[163:26.89]So mid-grab, he probably had one health.
[163:29.04]That dude, I stabbed him three times with zero health.
[163:31.62]And then he pressed triangle and got all his health back and couldn't kill him.
[163:34.50]Round two.
[163:36.02]What?
[163:36.60]Yeah, why is that in the fucking game?
[163:38.66]Wow.
[163:39.26]What the fuck is the point of that?
[163:40.41]No, explain that to me.
[163:41.67]Ubisoft, I want an employee to explain that to me.
[163:43.45]Hey, would you like an explanation?
[163:44.83]They added that mechanic into the game to help you win against multiple enemies.
[163:52.75]Karen.
[163:53.39]And yet he was able to build revenge in a 1v1.
[163:57.55]I am kind of a gamer Karen, aren't I?
[163:59.29]How the fuck am I gonna beat this motherfucker, seriously?
[164:05.61]I want somebody from management to tell me.
[164:07.28]I want a written letter about it.
[164:11.18]Oh, we just did this.
[164:14.38]The next room contained an old writing desk under the Der Hatchet family crest.
[164:19.39]On the desk were many items of interest.
[164:20.97]Too recent, Vito.
[164:22.05]No, I'm not wasting my last Vito on this.
[164:24.31]I loved this.
[164:26.13]This was a ton of fun.
[164:26.87]Old coins, wine, cryptic runes.
[164:31.59]Decipher the runes?
[164:33.46]But it's our Vito.
[164:34.34]Are you guys going to use one here?
[164:36.34]That'll leave you with two.
[164:38.56]The candle lit itself, and a funky phantom friar floated into the room.
[164:46.40]No, Vito?
[164:51.88]This guy looks friendly, okay?
[164:53.48]Burn his papers.
[164:55.16]Enjoy wine and candlelight.
[164:57.01]Are you naked here?
[164:58.37]I don't... He's snapped his fingers.
[164:59.95]I extinguished the candle in a glass of the house vino.
[165:02.97]Why not extend?
[165:03.77]Why?
[165:04.09]This stream was a week ago.
[165:06.23]What?
[165:07.59]Why would I extend the stream?
[165:08.71]You can just go... I didn't want to kill him.
[165:10.33]He just wanted to hang out.
[165:11.57]Six days ago.
[165:12.31]Oops.
[165:12.77]Well... Sorry.
[165:15.39]I won?
[165:15.67]I couldn't mute.
[165:17.81]What's the deal?
[165:19.83]Half of these monsters come up to me.
[165:21.65]Very non-hostile.
[165:24.22]I guess we're staying to watch the stream that just happened.
[165:29.54]You gonna do a Thanksgiving stream?
[165:30.74]No.
[165:34.16]Music room.
[165:34.98]I wanna go to the music room.
[165:38.66]Dude, your voice sounds different.
[165:40.36]What happened, dude?
[165:41.12]You sound completely different.
[165:43.62]Quickly leave the cellar.
[165:44.86]Search the cellar.
[165:45.64]Where's the music room?
[165:46.46]You sound like older.
[165:48.34]From now.
[165:53.48]You sound wicked jaded.
[165:56.73]What floor, please?
[165:58.53]Dude, you sound wicked jaded.
[165:59.85]Music room.
[166:00.27]You sound jaded.
[166:04.05]Whistle happy tune.
[166:05.27]First floor.
[166:05.73]Say second floor.
[166:07.62]Second floor.
[166:09.00]We're already on the first floor.
[166:09.76]I'm going to use my last veto.
[166:11.06]You guys won't.
[166:13.93]The second floor looked dark and uninviting.
[166:16.99]It's only another 50 seconds.
[166:21.70]Pick a room at random.
[166:23.24]Find the kitchen.
[166:25.34]Waste your veto.
[166:26.13]No.
[166:30.45]Good eats.
[166:32.11]The room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort.
[166:35.29]Running out of time?
[166:36.03]Well, you got about 20 minutes.
[166:39.10]Oh, there it is.
[166:41.04]See, the reason why you should be using your vetoes as a collective chat room if you have three, you still have three.
[166:46.22]Because you're looking for bingo here.
[166:48.78]And I'm telling you right now, you're not going to get it here and you have about 25 minutes.
[166:52.26]So you need to really kind of get your act together and skip some of these streams that are three minutes of just wasted time.
[167:00.03]Let's go right.
[167:00.67]Let's see.
[167:01.71]I'm just telling you.
[167:02.94]I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something odd about the woman in the kitchen.
[167:07.03]Here we go.
[167:10.95]That's why you haven't seen me lately.
[167:13.17]But I'm coming right back at you with this DayZ gameplay.
[167:16.71]And I've been playing this game for the last three weeks or so.
[167:19.81]And something to remember, something of note.
[167:22.15]I've died every single fucking time I've ever played this game.
[167:25.43]So I don't have any ghillie suits or any sniper rifles or anything like that.
[167:30.17]But I live on the edge.
[167:31.20]I live dangerously, as you see right here, walking down the main road.
[167:34.52]This was new to me.
[167:35.04]I don't remember this.
[167:35.52]What if somebody comes over there and tries to shoot you?
[167:37.34]Well, I'll knock his fucking teeth out.
[167:38.82]That's what's gonna happen.
[167:40.08]Please don't kill me.
[167:41.10]Please don't kill me.
[167:42.48]I'm so scared.
[167:43.65]I don't know what to do.
[167:45.25]I don't even have a weapon.
[167:46.25]I might as well just stand still while somebody kills me.
[167:50.76]You see, the real reason why you play this game is so you can roleplay.
[167:54.59]So let's start that right now.
[167:55.95]Vito, uh... This tower has stood here for over a thousand years.
[168:02.45]And it don't look rusty.
[168:04.01]You have to vote for this.
[168:06.65]Oh, wow, this is unanimous.
[168:08.96]And this was owned by... Alright, alright, it's unanimous.
[168:12.14]The great captain of England.
[168:14.08]Alright, you get... Alright, we're going.
[168:16.64]You got it.
[168:17.72]Done.
[168:20.24]I am currently on my way.
[168:23.29]Hey.
[168:26.27]Jeffrey.
[168:27.69]Jeffrey, I need to talk to you.
[168:28.83]Where are you, lad?
[168:35.69]I'm currently bleeding and profusely from the face and I need some bandages.
[168:41.23]I need some help here.
[168:42.15]I'm having fun playing.
[168:48.06]I haven't played in a long time.
[168:48.76]Is everybody even listening to me?
[168:52.53]Hey, hey.
[168:53.29]Look, let's work together.
[168:54.37]Come here, buddy.
[168:55.15]Come here.
[168:59.75]You didn't get scammed.
[169:01.29]I'll add three minutes to the timer.
[169:03.37]You didn't get scammed.
[169:08.86]I promise you didn't get scammed.
[169:10.94]Oh.
[169:13.76]Into the Warcraft 3 custom map thing on Battle.net, the only thing you would see was Dota.
[169:20.55]Dota 3.6, Dota 3.06 All-Stars, Dota, Dota, Dota, Dota, Dota.
[169:24.51]That's when everybody really started to get into it.
[169:26.87]And I was, let's just face it, I was really bad at it.
[169:29.65]I tried it a few times, I tried to play for a couple hours on the Dota games, and I would just get rocked.
[169:35.69]And...
[169:36.57]It kind of turned me off for the rest of my life.
[169:38.74]I'm not wasting a veto.
[169:39.28]I think that was when I was probably 16 or 17 years old.
[169:42.12]I'm not wasting a veto.
[169:42.80]It was a long time ago.
[169:43.90]But it turned me off from MOBAs.
[169:45.10]I never really wanted to get started in them again.
[169:46.64]League of Legends, they all kind of were the same.
[169:50.54]They were all that Warcraft 3 Dota that I was terrible at.
[169:53.11]Wait, you're vetoing?
[169:54.05]But now, along comes this game called Smite, which I wasn't really that excited for.
[169:58.73]I didn't really read up too much about it.
[170:00.09]I just knew it was a new MOBA coming out.
[170:01.75]But when I think of MOBA, like I told you guys before, I think of League of Legends, Han, I think of Dota 2, and it just kind of was like, I don't want to play it.
[170:09.88]The world did I know that this game was WASD to move, all third person, click to shoot,
[170:17.96]Using the default scattergun, the Crit-a-Cola, and the Sandman.
[170:22.49]This is the first time I've ever equipped the Sandman in a commentary ever.
[170:27.31]And not just a commentary.
[170:28.99]I haven't put this thing on probably since it came out back in like 2008 or 9.
[170:33.87]Whenever they released this thing.
[170:35.43]I haven't used it once since then.
[170:37.77]This is also on CP Gravelpit, and it's on defense if you couldn't already tell.
[170:43.12]Now here, let me tell you why I'm playing Scout.
[170:45.32]Scout on Gravelpit on defense is really, really awesome.
[170:49.38]Because if you can see in the bottom of the screen, they have to capture these two.
[170:53.90]This is a good one.
[170:55.90]Oh, fuck!
[170:56.54]We have to do it again.
[170:59.42]Wheelman?
[171:03.22]He'll die, don't worry.
[171:08.34]God damn it.
[171:09.16]They're like little mice.
[171:10.58]You ever try to catch a mice with your bare hands?
[171:12.27]There you go.
[171:13.65]He's dead.
[171:14.79]Two minutes.
[171:15.55]Oh, shit.
[171:16.43]This way.
[171:17.71]Lose him down an alley.
[171:24.11]I can't believe we skipped.
[171:24.86]Not perfect.
[171:25.16]Almost perfect.
[171:27.66]Look at how shitty this looks.
[171:29.00]My streams.
[171:29.96]My god.
[171:30.16]This is like 2,000 bitrate.
[171:31.08]This is like 2015.
[171:36.74]This is back before, like, they raised the cap.
[171:39.54]Left again.
[171:43.14]Left again.
[171:43.50]I think I'm running fucking circles, you know what I mean?
[171:49.62]This is rumor and doi doi doi.
[171:51.74]No, it's not.
[171:54.77]Rumor has to be somebody driving by.
[171:56.17]It's like, perfect dick idiots.
[171:59.93]The download counts towards the hour.
[172:01.77]No, it does not.
[172:04.19]You still don't stream in 1080p?
[172:06.37]That's because you need a higher bitrate to go higher than 720p.
[172:11.02]If you don't have a higher bitrate, then it looks like shit, especially if you're at 60fps.
[172:14.78]I don't stream at 30fps.
[172:16.56]Get it!
[172:17.88]Go, please.
[172:19.58]Go.
[172:19.82]I think the cops are teleporting, by the way.
[172:26.17]Wearing the fence.
[172:29.85]The fence is now part of the car.
[172:33.12]Nice.
[172:33.60]That works.
[172:36.71]Transcoding Andy.
[172:43.58]Oh!
[172:44.86]How far away is this?
[172:45.60]Why can't you raise your bitrate?
[172:46.86]I see people do 1080 and 60.
[172:48.98]Come on.
[172:49.63]They probably have a streaming PC.
[172:50.55]They're probably streaming at more than 6,000.
[172:51.95]Do it.
[172:54.35]6,000 bitrate, 1080p, 60 FPS.
[172:56.65]It doesn't look good in motion.
[172:58.77]Please get there and do it.
[172:59.87]It doesn't look good in motion.
[173:01.35]12 seconds.
[173:02.26]If you're doing 30, you can do it.
[173:04.70]You can do it.
[173:06.78]I have a 3090, yeah.
[173:09.84]I don't want to... Get in the circle!
[173:11.96]Get in the circle!
[173:13.76]Holy shit, relax.
[173:15.10]What the fuck was that?
[173:16.38]My mic peaked.
[173:21.39]What the hell was that?
[173:22.35]Yeah, I think you guys are in trouble.
[173:24.35]I don't think you're gonna get another 100 subs.
[173:26.17]You got about 15 minutes.
[173:27.57]At 5.15.
[173:39.86]That's it.
[173:42.20]You're looking for gambling.
[173:43.22]You're looking for Drew Crew.
[173:44.12]You're looking for a wink.
[173:44.90]You're looking for naked.
[173:46.41]You're looking for a Vroomer.
[173:47.41]A Vroomer driving by.
[173:48.71]You're looking for an extreme Jex moment.
[173:53.15]And even if you get Jex, you still need to get the naked moment, too.
[173:56.81]It's a different game.
[174:01.26]We go to Tokyo.
[174:02.78]Chocolatier?
[174:03.34]Not yet.
[174:03.62]10 out of 10 game, by the way.
[174:05.08]I need to go to Kono.
[174:08.53]Is it a grandma game?
[174:09.43]This is a pretty damn fun grandma game.
[174:11.73]It was.
[174:12.75]I don't care.
[174:13.39]Grandma games can be fun.
[174:14.55]Are you kidding me?
[174:15.33]Uh-oh.
[174:19.90]There is gambling in this.
[174:21.64]What?
[174:23.44]You are a grandma.
[174:24.54]Fine.
[174:26.20]But is it right here?
[174:28.22]It's too early.
[174:34.09]Yeah, I don't think... It's a different island.
[174:36.09]Be careful here.
[174:36.49]If you use your last life here, you have one more.
[174:37.90]Do you have two more?
[174:50.39]Take 120 cases of your Tart of the Moon to Zach.
[174:53.99]I think the gambling happens very, very much further in this mod.
[174:58.21]You have two more.
[174:58.83]You can either extend or you can veto.
[175:01.33]I'm staying here because I don't have any.
[175:04.18]Everybody else hates it, but he's keeping me in business.
[175:07.82]It's too late, yeah.
[175:12.02]You could veto this.
[175:13.00]120 cases.
[175:13.38]Well, I have to get that ready.
[175:18.60]It's far too early for gambling, even if you extend it twice.
[175:20.60]God damn it.
[175:21.32]What do I need?
[175:21.94]Tar to the moon is such a pain in the ass.
[175:26.24]No, no, no.
[175:26.68]I'm just burning the clock right now against you guys.
[175:29.39]Okay, I need 125 lemons.
[175:32.21]I hiked the ball and just went down.
[175:33.53]Fucking lemons.
[175:39.25]Okay, let's go.
[175:41.41]We need to hold, hold.
[175:43.71]Oh, it's so late to do a veto now.
[175:45.79]That would be a waste.
[175:47.59]Run the clock.
[175:49.33]TikTok, run the clock.
[175:51.01]I'll take lemons, please.
[175:52.39]I need 125 of them.
[175:54.17]Too late now.
[175:57.55]Oh, I love how this is just so slow.
[175:59.05]There's nothing happening.
[176:00.17]This is perfect for me.
[176:02.27]Perfect.
[176:02.61]What did I just buy?
[176:12.80]Let's get a reminder here.
[176:15.73]It just looks like a lemon.
[176:17.67]No, look at me either.
[176:18.85]I do that every other stream.
[176:20.59]I'm surprised you haven't seen it yet.
[176:21.65]It looks like a lemon.
[176:22.89]I just clicked it and said go, whatever.
[176:25.07]There was a part where click maps were on every stream too.
[176:27.81]I got $860,000.
[176:28.71]Who cares?
[176:29.15]Let me extend.
[176:33.88]I'm making Tar of the Moons.
[176:36.44]I can do better than 21 though.
[176:37.96]I seriously can.
[176:38.56]Okay, come on.
[176:52.25]This is gambling.
[176:53.07]No, it's not.
[176:53.53]Well, we're going to go for it.
[177:02.75]Hopefully this pirate doesn't like me.
[177:07.90]And... Oh, this is absolutely not going to happen.
[177:11.36]Nope, that ain't happening.
[177:13.40]Make our way back again.
[177:14.26]Oh, we've seen a lot of vetoes here.
[177:16.46]You have until 5.15.
[177:17.02]And...
[177:19.40]Can we do it?
[177:20.62]Although, wait a minute.
[177:21.28]Hold on.
[177:21.56]I'm not going to say anything.
[177:22.56]And here we go.
[177:23.10]I'm not going to say anything.
[177:24.60]Nobody pay attention to me.
[177:26.00]Oh, I'm done.
[177:26.66]Okay.
[177:27.04]There's a lot going on here.
[177:28.00]This is going to be tough.
[177:30.56]Oh, you bumped him right into me.
[177:31.44]By the way, if a Vito does come through, you get the full 180 seconds again.
[177:35.82]Just make sure you understand that.
[177:39.03]Oh, God, no.
[177:40.41]He got in the way.
[177:42.35]Cactus Canyon was so good.
[177:46.21]Oh, get him out of here.
[177:47.69]This seems pretty unanimous so far.
[177:51.38]You give me that over and things are going to change.
[177:56.14]Oh.
[177:57.47]Thanks for hanging out.
[178:00.63]Run up the stairs on all fours.
[178:02.01]I can do that.
[178:02.83]No, I'm not going to do that.
[178:04.51]I'm not going to do that.
[178:08.45]Slide down the stairs.
[178:09.55]You want me to make a sled and go down the stairs?
[178:11.60]What are we looking for?
[178:12.68]What do you mean we have a chance?
[178:15.04]What am I going to use for a sled?
[178:18.24]You know, I could probably use the
[178:20.78]I can probably use the bed sheet.
[178:23.28]This is the dumpy?
[178:23.84]That might actually be possible.
[178:24.78]That might actually be easy.
[178:27.22]Use the whiteboard.
[178:29.11]Oh, shit!
[178:30.49]Okay.
[178:31.25]Oh, right.
[178:32.95]How long is this?
[178:37.01]Oh, no.
[178:37.45]That gives opportunity here.
[178:46.44]What am I doing?
[178:51.66]Oh shit, it's an extension.
[178:55.62]What a weirdo!
[178:56.40]What are you doing?
[178:57.04]Oh no, it's gonna happen, isn't it?
[179:20.40]I don't know when it happens though.
[179:24.86]Just looking to see how much fucking shit was in there.
[179:26.98]There was like a bunch of costumes.
[179:31.95]Why is this VOD so shitty?
[179:39.65]Do I know that I'm live?
[179:41.17]Why does it look like I don't even know the camera's on?
[179:47.67]Did I think I turned the stream off?
[179:48.79]Nothing in there.
[179:54.68]Browse the subreddit.
[179:55.64]No, I don't want to browse the subreddit.
[179:58.76]Let's just make like a fucking dinosaur out of clay.
[180:00.96]I don't have any clay.
[180:02.38]I can't even hear it.
[180:03.84]Make a dinosaur out of clay?
[180:10.02]No, I don't... Yeah, I know.
[180:21.02]I'm extending it.
[180:21.64]It's already gone.
[180:27.32]Play rock, paper, scissors.
[180:28.36]Okay, we can do that.
[180:34.92]Ready?
[180:37.14]Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
[180:40.86]I won.
[180:42.62]First person that wrote something was paper, and I won.
[180:46.30]You were so thin and young.
[180:49.24]This was like three years ago, guys.
[180:53.03]It's tied.
[180:56.06]I don't know.
[180:56.70]Will it happen in the next three minutes?
[180:58.80]Dude, I need to put the mic back up to my mouth.
[181:00.42]What am I doing?
[181:00.88]You aged like milk.
[181:02.10]Um, excuse me.
[181:03.02]I don't think so.
[181:20.07]I think I've aged like a fucking, I've aged like fucking blue cheese, which is moldy and old, but it's fucking delicious.
[181:24.60]What is that?
[181:25.06]What is this on me?
[181:26.98]This is fucking a ghost ectoplasm.
[181:35.97]What the fuck is that?
[181:37.81]There is a ghost in here.
[181:39.62]He slimed me.
[181:44.14]That was like a cobweb.
[181:45.36]That was like a spider web.
[181:46.72]That was fucked up.
[181:51.42]I didn't say anything.
[181:52.42]You didn't hear anything.
[181:54.56]I actually kind of like this little microphone.
[181:57.60]Right?
[181:58.64]I like it.
[181:59.16]It's fun.
[182:02.98]There's a spider in here somewhere probably.
[182:04.57]I probably ran it over when I was doing the fucking sick sled move that you guys just saw.
[182:10.55]You're drunk as fuck in this.
[182:12.05]Am I?
[182:12.31]Do a ghost hunt stream.
[182:16.47]Wait, is this where I do the magic trick?
[182:20.86]Oh, this is where I do the magic trick where I unplug my router on camera and plug it back in and like it turns the stream off but it like doesn't, right?
[182:28.74]I just disappear?
[182:29.12]You extending again?
[182:29.62]Oh, this is risky.
[182:30.04]I can't do a house tour, guys.
[182:46.00]I can't believe that worked.
[182:46.86]I unplugged the Ethernet from my router.
[182:48.97]I would need four people to lift it up.
[182:51.35]And I would plug it back in and sprint out of the fucking room, and I would just disappear.
[182:55.33]Why was that happening?
[182:59.47]Did you see how this just scraped my nose?
[183:07.91]All in?
[183:08.21]We're trying to do anything right now.
[183:11.62]I have been trying to kill time here for, like, a fucking hour almost.
[183:15.84]And it's still not working.
[183:21.50]Look at me.
[183:21.94]Yeah, it's off.
[183:25.92]Do I, like, pretend to take my shirt off?
[183:27.00]What happens if I do this?
[183:28.66]Like, can you guys hear my stomach?
[183:31.38]You want me to do, like, an endoscopy?
[183:34.30]Let's see if you guys can hear inside my, like, esophagus.
[183:46.66]Could you hear it?
[183:53.10]That was loud inside?
[183:54.10]Hold on.
[184:00.32]What are you doing?
[184:01.04]He is screaming.
[184:17.69]I hear screaming.
[184:24.59]Everybody's waiting for it.
[184:25.35]I don't know if it's going to happen, though.
[184:28.75]Ears are dead.
[184:29.47]Really?
[184:30.77]I turned it down so low, too.
[184:32.07]I'm so sorry.
[184:32.77]Blame.
[184:32.91]Blame Comcast.
[184:43.93]This is such a cursed stream.
[184:48.41]It was gross.
[184:49.53]It probably was.
[184:54.06]How was my birthday?
[184:55.92]It was pretty sick.
[184:57.60]So, wait.
[184:58.34]Okay, hold on a second.
[185:00.34]If... You guys are out of extensions.
[185:04.30]That's it.
[185:07.33]You're not going to see the thing you think you're going to see.
[185:13.92]Let's play a game called What President Are You?
[185:17.69]From the side profile.
[185:22.97]What president am I?
[185:27.49]What are you talking about?
[185:33.34]Lincoln?
[185:36.68]I would say probably Jefferson.
[185:39.04]Grover Cleveland?
[185:39.68]I saw Grover Cleveland.
[185:42.78]You were fucked up three years ago.
[185:44.42]Wasn't I this fucked up?
[185:45.00]I could be a pretty good Lincoln, I think, from this angle.
[185:49.30]Lincoln had a full bald head, right?
[185:52.70]Did he?
[185:53.70]No, Lincoln had a ponytail, right?
[185:56.45]So Lincoln had a bun ponytail up here.
[185:59.47]Okay.
[186:00.93]If you get another one, I get another one.
[186:06.69]If you get another one, I get another one.
[186:10.04]You really want to make that trade?
[186:13.54]Do you want to extend?
[186:15.45]Put it up.
[186:21.11]So, um... You got 10 minutes.
[186:28.22]I know what Abraham Lincoln looks like.
[186:29.52]I can close my eyes and see him.
[186:32.38]Uh...
[186:34.03]Big eyes up here.
[186:35.87]Two big eyes.
[186:38.39]Blue fur.
[186:39.13]Is he Cookie Monster?
[186:40.29]His mouth opens like this.
[186:41.95]What?
[186:43.49]He's got the no nose.
[186:45.65]And he's eating cookies.
[186:48.78]Eating cookies a lot of times.
[186:49.64]Are we doing it?
[186:51.20]Right?
[186:51.64]Okay.
[186:53.82]Okay.
[186:54.20]No, that's right.
[186:55.72]You guys want to see it so bad.
[186:56.82]I don't know if it's going to happen, though.
[187:00.38]I get another one, too.
[187:01.69]No, yeah, that's correct.
[187:03.33]I just closed my eyes and that's what I saw.
[187:05.53]Among Us character on the whiteboard?
[187:07.59]A side profile of red?
[187:16.76]Do some quizzes.
[187:17.88]Is that what you mean?
[187:18.54]I'm not prepared to do any quizzes.
[187:20.66]I'm just going to go rage eat.
[187:23.42]That's so fucking funny.
[187:25.54]I'm going to go just rage eat.
[187:28.07]No, I'm not supposed to be angry about this.
[187:29.87]Oh, by the way, everybody.
[187:31.11]I have a lot of work to do.
[187:32.50]You've got so much work to do.
[187:33.46]You've extended.
[187:34.78]But I've received into my bank account a veto.
[187:37.76]We'll do a BuzzFeed quiz.
[187:39.20]Interesting.
[187:40.34]So I can veto this right now.
[187:42.18]Interesting.
[187:44.42]Well.
[187:44.86]Huh.
[187:50.73]You don't need to know when I want to use my video.
[187:52.71]I could use it whenever I want.
[187:53.57]Typing into Google, BuzzFeed quiz.
[187:57.35]And I don't even care what the first one is.
[187:59.30]This is the one we're going to do.
[188:02.16]Okay, take this.
[188:03.00]It's a pizza quiz.
[188:04.04]Take this pizza quiz.
[188:05.54]That's when I punch the camera.
[188:06.44]We'll reveal your mental and actual age.
[188:11.93]Okay, hold on a minute.
[188:12.81]Let me get this on screen.
[188:14.87]We're going to do a pizza quiz.
[188:16.05]That would be stupid.
[188:16.81]Nobody gets anything.
[188:20.59]Let's see if they can get it.
[188:24.84]Like this.
[188:25.36]Let me just get it on the stream.
[188:27.34]I'm going to hold it.
[188:28.86]Because I know everyone's waiting for, like, the Lugami poses and shit that I'm going to do.
[188:32.48]But I don't think it happens.
[188:33.70]Or I think it already did happen.
[188:35.44]Okay.
[188:35.72]Pizza quiz.
[188:36.54]There it is.
[188:38.30]Yeah.
[188:42.09]I think you guys screwed.
[188:43.69]They're going to get my age here.
[188:45.33]They're going to get my mental age and my physical age, apparently.
[188:48.03]Somehow.
[188:49.41]Somehow.
[188:51.33]She was laying on the whiteboard.
[188:52.89]Oh, you guys are... You guys just blew through two extensions.
[188:56.53]Three extensions.
[188:57.95]It's over.
[188:58.41]And you gave me a veto.
[188:59.75]It happens at 29 minutes.
[189:00.53]Oh, no.
[189:00.69]Oh, no.
[189:00.87]Alright.
[189:15.25]It was an opportunity for like a pose.
[189:18.57]I think this still is an opportunity.
[189:19.67]We got meat lovers, seafood.
[189:22.65]Who the fuck is ordering seafood on their pizza?
[189:24.87]Yeah, I agree.
[189:25.95]That's weird.
[189:26.43]What's on there?
[189:28.46]I don't like that.
[189:29.08]Dinosaur feet on here.
[189:32.54]No, absolutely not.
[189:39.30]Supreme.
[189:39.95]That's a bad take.
[189:41.19]Whatever.
[189:41.47]What is Supreme?
[189:42.51]It's fine.
[189:43.03]It could be a bad take.
[189:44.09]There's no meat on here.
[189:46.18]Meat Lovers sucks, it falls apart.
[189:47.46]It's like you're eating a lasagna.
[189:49.10]Barbecue chicken, mmm... close.
[189:51.04]Barbecue chicken's alright.
[189:51.74]Pepperoni, that's pretty good, but who the f- Who the fuck was put- who put the olives in there?
[189:56.20]Box.
[189:59.28]Slime Rancher?
[190:00.80]What else should I do here?
[190:03.60]I could buy another plot.
[190:04.94]Wait!
[190:07.20]They're actually my- I'm- Oh, shit.
[190:08.59]This was peak.
[190:09.23]The overgrowth.
[190:10.03]Let's go!
[190:11.48]Yeah, let's just peek like poses and doy doy doys and shit.
[190:14.12]I might get rid of this.
[190:15.00]Oh, yeah.
[190:15.46]I remember I softlocked myself in here.
[190:17.93]Right, okay.
[190:18.83]So what's over here?
[190:21.33]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[190:22.41]Why is the camera so bad?
[190:23.49]It looks awful.
[190:26.33]Get a rooster, get a rooster.
[190:27.21]Well, there's no roosters over here, but hold on.
[190:33.03]What plots?
[190:34.95]It's always been this bad?
[190:36.67]Not this bad.
[190:38.09]I built this area myself.
[190:40.79]I'm just dumping an entire coffee on my ground, on my desk and everything.
[190:43.37]I already did that.
[190:44.59]This just makes me feel cool.
[190:46.57]I still can't believe I actually did that earlier, like a couple hours ago.
[190:48.83]Remember, get a rooster.
[190:51.75]I will.
[190:53.78]That sucks because it's been so clean in here.
[190:55.60]It really has.
[190:56.46]And now it's going to be like gross coffee.
[190:58.06]It's not about coffee spills.
[191:00.47]I don't know what the vile, disgusting properties like enzymes in coffee or whatever, but when you spill coffee and it dries, it smells like that dirty fucking ass garbage can.
[191:12.83]It's disgusting.
[191:18.40]Milk, I don't put milk in my coffee, but it still does that.
[191:21.28]It just smells like just decaying dead flesh or something.
[191:26.66]I'm going to clean this again when I'm done.
[191:29.71]You look so young.
[191:31.07]Dude, this was like seven months ago.
[191:34.63]This was not that long ago.
[191:36.33]I just have a shaved face.
[191:37.15]I have a shaved face and a haircut.
[191:38.09]Whatever.
[191:55.19]I got a lot of money.
[191:55.79]I'm going to do MK3, MK2, whatever it is.
[191:59.01]It's kind of weird, though, because you guys have a real-time vision of decades plus of my life.
[192:04.95]So there will be a point where I kind of look old, right?
[192:07.64]Maybe it's starting to happen.
[192:10.48]You have a barometer of a decade plus of on-camera shit.
[192:16.61]You'll be able to know the moment that I turn old.
[192:19.55]Pulse wave feature to your backpack.
[192:22.86]You got fatter.
[192:25.34]Yeah, I know.
[192:29.36]Get a rooster.
[192:29.94]Oh my god, guys.
[192:32.91]I meant remind me to get a rooster.
[192:34.77]Not spam.
[192:36.01]Get a rooster.
[192:40.29]Take these out.
[192:40.77]Will be.
[192:41.45]Okay, grandpa.
[192:48.14]Hey, look, I'm telling you, I'm almost, I'm getting closer to 40.
[192:53.04]If I can keep this up, look, if I can look.
[192:55.12]Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito.
[192:56.90]Vito, Vito.
[192:57.98]What the fuck?
[192:59.27]Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito.
[193:01.27]Vito, Vito, Vito, Vito.
[193:17.48]Or what's that called?
[193:19.68]Oh god, I don't have any ammo.
[193:20.80]I'm out of eaters.
[193:21.66]God, get this spy out of here.
[193:30.53]No, keep him off the cat.
[193:32.79]What's in there?
[193:33.83]Listening to that shit.
[193:36.89]Was I just asking what your pregnancy cravings were?
[193:39.94]What am I talking about?
[193:40.98]Yeah, this teleport is still up.
[193:42.84]What is wrong with me?
[193:44.96]What the fuck, Jeremy?
[193:46.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[193:48.28]What's wrong with you?
[193:50.34]I can smell you.
[193:51.92]I can smell you from a mile away.
[193:53.76]I can smell you getting off the elevator.
[193:56.72]Oh, wait, that's from Home Alone.
[193:59.22]Oh, come on.
[194:00.36]Nobody has any vetoes left.
[194:01.66]We just... Getting off the elevator.
[194:03.94]Oh, you was here last night too, wasn't you?
[194:06.06]What was it?
[194:06.86]You was here.
[194:07.71]And you were smooching.
[194:10.31]You were smooching all over everybody.
[194:14.43]That is such a fantastic movie.
[194:16.23]I remember this.
[194:16.63]Happy New Year.
[194:19.03]Keep the change, you filthy animal.
[194:20.71]That's a spy.
[194:21.75]Wow, we have like four snipers sitting in the back here.
[194:24.11]I just got clubbed.
[194:26.19]I got the spy.
[194:26.75]Oh, save my century.
[194:27.53]Thank you.
[194:28.03]Marcus Van Machinery, you are...
[194:30.86]Machinery.
[194:31.90]Yeah, machine.
[194:32.68]Am I even saying that word right?
[194:34.68]Alright.
[194:35.54]I'm feeling generous.
[194:35.98]For the longest time, I didn't know how to pronounce the machinist with Christian Bale.
[194:40.15]I thought it was called the mechanist.
[194:41.39]We each get two more vetoes.
[194:43.83]The mechanist.
[194:44.65]Let's go.
[194:44.95]We each get two more vetoes or extensions.
[194:47.91]Oh, my God.
[194:48.75]That guy is... Neil, let's go.
[194:51.09]How is that guy still up there?
[194:53.31]Yeah, he had nowhere to go.
[194:54.21]The gates closed behind him.
[194:57.30]We're supposed to be over?
[194:58.58]Oh yeah, we're supposed to be over, but I did my ultimate extension.
[195:02.94]Use 1 to go back.
[195:04.36]That's not how this program works.
[195:09.12]No deal?
[195:09.85]What do you mean, no deal?
[195:11.03]This is the bonus round.
[195:15.15]We're in bonus round territory.
[195:24.65]Look.
[195:26.60]Look at how close you are.
[195:29.42]You really want to throw the opportunity away?
[195:31.36]I mean, you already won once.
[195:32.56]Alright, let's go.
[195:34.00]No deal means the stream turns off.
[195:37.82]Have you guys figured this out?
[195:40.49]You guys, double or nothing.
[195:52.98]Wait a minute.
[195:54.97]Okay, hold on.
[195:57.55]What do I get?
[195:58.13]Wow, that is crazy.
[196:00.87]So if you get... Okay, how about this?
[196:03.09]We're going to remove all... Here's what we're doing.
[196:06.47]We're going to remove all vetoes, all extensions.
[196:10.73]Nobody can do shit.
[196:12.39]I'm going to do the randomizer five more times.
[196:16.09]If it hits... Actually, I want to veto this one.
[196:20.42]Why is...
[196:22.19]Why is the world shaking?
[196:28.49]I can hear noises that I don't like to hear.
[196:31.09]I'm not naked.
[196:32.19]I'm just sunburnt.
[196:35.77]What's that?
[196:37.37]What's this like fairy dust on the ground?
[196:39.07]Oh, is this roller skates?
[196:46.93]Sick.
[196:47.15]I got like the roller skates.
[196:49.27]I can compete in like the roller derby.
[196:51.55]I'm not naked.
[196:52.43]Alright.
[196:54.01]No vetoes.
[196:55.01]Five.
[196:55.55]This included this one.
[196:57.61]Four more rolls and that's it.
[196:58.87]I don't know what it was back in the old YouTube days.
[197:06.21]I was always red.
[197:07.11]It was always just sunburned.
[197:09.23]Every single video.
[197:11.77]Turn the flashlight off.
[197:12.44]Turn the flashlight off.
[197:15.74]Scare is already up there.
[197:27.71]If I still had a veto I would get rid of it right now I swear to God It's gone.
[197:32.59]What is what is that?
[197:36.50]It's not there anymore is this before your nose job Just tensed up I feel lifted 200 pounds of weight I
[197:51.14]I just did all my reps for like the week.
[197:53.67]Excuse me?
[197:54.25]Because like the thing with like the flaming Dr. Doom skull was looking at me.
[198:03.58]You look like a...
[198:06.69]There's just no, I just don't know where I'm going.
[198:08.89]Why aren't you buff anymore?
[198:10.59]I don't know.
[198:11.21]Because I'm in my 30s.
[198:11.87]There's no indication of where you're ever supposed to go in the game.
[198:14.35]I'm in my 30s.
[198:15.31]Because in this video, I'm like in my mid-20s, and I'm fucking jacked and sunburned.
[198:20.53]I had so much vitamin D in my body that it was making my skin red.
[198:24.10]My name is Jerma.
[198:26.16]Okay?
[198:26.62]I'm in my 30s.
[198:27.14]I would like to sell you some land.
[198:34.04]What is- Ah!
[198:35.62]Oh!
[198:41.04]Who are this?
[198:44.84]Did you see that?
[198:45.58]Is that a pog?
[198:47.50]That's a pog.
[198:53.04]Oh, no.
[198:55.56]It's a pog face.
[198:56.80]It's a pog.
[198:58.82]Oh, no.
[198:59.46]This is getting hard now.
[199:07.60]Ayayay.
[199:08.56]How long has it been?
[199:10.08]I've only been recording for five minutes!
[199:15.13]Well...
[199:18.04]It doesn't do anything.
[199:19.47]It's just kind of there for fun.
[199:20.95]Everyone got a new hat, too.
[199:22.31]New sunglasses.
[199:23.85]New, uh, new hat and stuff like that.
[199:27.59]Oh, snooze.
[199:28.79]Oh, snooze.
[199:29.41]This is gonna be fucking boring.
[199:30.91]I can't veto this.
[199:31.53]You can get all these items if you pre-order Deus Ex, the new Deus Ex game.
[199:35.45]Or, you can find them in drops, and they are craftable.
[199:37.96]If I laugh at this, I will give a hundred subs.
[199:39.78]Because I want a Deus Ex anyways.
[199:42.00]So, let's get into this, guys.
[199:43.58]Here, we're gonna start with the Engineer and the new Engineer items.
[199:48.09]Let's start by saying that this is a very, very odd mechanic.
[199:50.95]Take a look at my ammo count down there.
[199:53.13]It takes 60 ammo to shoot it.
[199:55.47]You do not have a clip anymore.
[199:57.10]There's no reloading.
[199:58.10]There's no reload time or anything like that.
[200:00.94]It's just 60 metal to shoot that gun, and it's 35 metal to shoot the new pistol.
[200:07.79]very very weird mechanic because you'll find that you'll have no more metal left to shoot the gun and you're kinda just like oh crap now what do I do it's gonna take a lot of getting used to but for a combat engineer this will be a awesome new item especially the new shotgun because how many times have you been able to not place a mini sentry down when you wanted to because you didn't have enough ammo or metal see look at my ammo count 113 96 you shoot you lose but you gain it's weird
[200:35.82]Then this new item here, this new pistol, it electrocutes people.
[200:38.80]It's very, very odd.
[200:40.20]Hopefully we can figure this all out, guys, in the near future, in the next couple weeks.
[200:44.02]It works on buildings as well.
[200:46.38]So if you shoot a building, I believe point-blank it gives you, let's see here, I think it's 80 to 85 metal per point-blank shot.
[200:55.52]So I electrocute this sniper.
[200:56.96]It's kind of a weird mechanic.
[200:58.68]It's like a Tesla coil, kind of.
[201:01.11]I didn't want to show myself lose.
[201:03.09]I was getting killed.
[201:03.57]And I cut.
[201:19.88]But the problem here, guys, is you have to be a good shot.
[201:23.32]If you miss all the time, if you're not good with the shotgun, I do not recommend you try and get this item because you will just lose metal over and over again.
[201:31.65]So I get a little assist with that thing.
[201:33.69]It's very weird.
[201:35.37]See, 60, 60, 60, 80, 80.
[201:37.46]It's very, very cool.
[201:38.24]See, look.
[201:38.90]See how this thing is spreading?
[201:40.02]The electrical charge is spreading around.
[201:41.92]Maybe it's a new spy check mechanic.
[201:43.46]Maybe you can check for spies.
[201:45.40]I'm not sure yet, guys.
[201:46.44]This is the first time I've ever played with it.
[201:48.96]Just want to make sure I get you guys some cool gameplay with it so you see exactly how the item works.
[201:53.55]I haven't tried to destroy any projectiles with it yet with the pistol because I didn't really have a chance, to be honest.
[202:00.01]So trying to get that to work, I'm assuming that it's sort of like a reflect.
[202:04.11]You just click once and that's it.
[202:08.14]Let's move on to the spy.
[202:09.22]This is really, really cool.
[202:10.50]You'll see here.
[202:10.94]I think I'm alright.
[202:11.94]I decloak next to this sentry over here.
[202:14.00]It doesn't matter.
[202:14.54]Like I said, it can be a mini sentry.
[202:16.04]It can be a big sentry.
[202:17.62]Backstab the engine.
[202:18.28]Thank God.
[202:19.02]Okay.
[202:20.06]Please.
[202:21.21]Thank God.
[202:22.89]People were saying these clips are so bad.
[202:24.43]Most of you fucking guys wake up at 5 a.m.
[202:28.75]No.
[202:30.93]Some of you do.
[202:34.84]E3 2019.
[202:35.42]I don't believe that at all.
[202:38.44]Yeah, most of us get up at 5.
[202:40.69]No, most of you get up at like 11, 10.
[202:44.93]You know why?
[202:45.75]Some of you, especially during the summertime.
[202:48.35]You know, I've got demographics.
[202:50.82]I actually do.
[202:54.20]I know.
[202:54.72]Exactly how old most of you guys are.
[202:56.30]I count Olaf hair.
[202:58.18]I look so much worse.
[203:00.74]And that's it.
[203:01.66]Fuck.
[203:03.71]I look so much better over here.
[203:05.03]I'm getting that haircut again.
[203:07.47]College age is what a lot of you guys are.
[203:09.83]You guys are in college.
[203:11.97]When I was in college, I didn't get up till fucking like 6 p.m.
[203:18.90]So.
[203:19.40]You look dirty.
[203:20.34]Oh, yeah.
[203:20.58]We get up at five every day.
[203:23.10]I don't look dirty.
[203:23.98]Who's older?
[203:24.58]Sorry.
[203:26.16]The data says otherwise.
[203:31.11]How do we know how old you are?
[203:33.53]I just have a beard.
[203:34.29]I have morning classes.
[203:36.49]Not right now.
[203:38.28]I wink here?
[203:39.08]Are you in high school or college right now?
[203:45.18]You're out.
[203:45.58]Far into this.
[203:48.95]You're out of school.
[203:50.59]You got up at like fucking 8 o'clock this afternoon.
[203:52.93]Hugh Hefner?
[203:53.93]I use it as afternoon.
[203:55.85]You got up this afternoon at 8 o'clock.
[203:58.61]That's how you can tell I fucking stay up really late.
[204:01.39]8 p.m. is like in the middle of the afternoon.
[204:03.47]Old Jerma smells better.
[204:04.79]I don't think so.
[204:08.24]I think we smell about the same
[204:09.00]I stayed up all night I was thinking about doing that because I didn't want to miss this because I really did not want to tell everybody-
[204:15.00]We got three more that I was going to be here at nine o'clock in the morning and just not show up. So I was like fuck-
[204:19.00]Left Jerma is creepy. Why? Because I'm wearing a bathrobe?
[204:25.00]I thought about it. No, I- I slept, I did.
[204:29.00]There's no wink.
[204:30.00]I would have been delirious.
[204:35.98]Lipstick?
[204:36.86]No, it's called my lips are always dry, so I have to always put an application on.
[204:41.36]Like now.
[204:41.90]Well, why didn't you?
[204:42.52]You should have gone to bed.
[204:43.18]I have a lot of different looks, guys.
[204:53.64]Although I haven't worn a suit in probably 10 years.
[204:56.42]12.
[204:56.90]Oh, you should do that.
[204:58.16]I've done that before, and it's... I just... Okay, do you remember the first 15 to 20 minutes of this stream?
[205:06.91]Go watch it.
[205:07.75]It was only... It looked like you drank blood.
[205:09.67]Do you remember?
[205:10.99]Go watch that.
[205:12.17]I was sitting here, just turning the stream on, just barely had woken up, and I'm just like... I was weird.
[205:18.62]I was a weirdo.
[205:20.70]Gonna cap it, there's no reason for me to be here.
[205:22.00]I'm gonna try and pick off people that come out of the spawn.
[205:24.00]And nobody really comes out, they all go the other direction-
[205:26.00]Alright, again, no reactions at all. Zero emotion or I'll gift a hundred subs.
[205:31.00]Trying to find somebody that- I can't shoot that guy, can't shoot that guy, so I just go over to the right side of the spawn.
[205:36.00]And I end up getting a heavy.
[205:37.00]He just kind of comes out and he just- bang! Gets him right there.
[205:41.00]That's going to be the end of the gameplay guys.
[205:43.00]Thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate all the support you guys give.
[205:46.00]It's over.
[205:47.00]So I'll see you all next time, take care everybody.
[205:51.10]That was a great gameplay.
[205:53.92]That one doesn't count.
[205:57.15]Yeah, actually does not count.
[206:02.95]Oops.
[206:05.15]It's not over.
[206:05.59]No, it's not.
[206:06.45]That doesn't count.
[206:08.84]Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demoman with the stuff that's on the screen right now I believe it's the strange lock and load the charge and charge and the Eyelander strange Eyelander and of course the other hats and crap the miscellaneous whatever a battery canteen I don't want to give advice no it's an advice video not really to do about the game it's an advice video what's the advice Fortress 2
[206:34.07]Specifically, how to get better at landing your pipe.
[206:36.82]Oh, no, no, no.
[206:37.66]Really anything in this game that has travel time.
[206:41.12]Oh, no.
[206:41.28]This is not really going to talk about hitscan, although this will probably help you out with your skitscan.
[206:47.42]What the hell was I going to just say?
[206:48.96]With your hitscan as well.
[206:50.63]But it's mainly going to focus on the travel time things like the Demoman Pipes, all the rocket launchers, and even the syringe gun.
[206:57.81]This could probably help you out with the syringe gun as well.
[206:59.91]And what it is, it's TR Walkway.
[207:03.76]I didn't know anything about this map for the longest time.
[207:06.70]And just very recently.
[207:08.06]Wait, we don't have that.
[207:08.96]There was no deal.
[207:11.96]It's a map you can play pretty much by yourself.
[207:13.70]Deal begins now.
[207:14.26]And it's been shooting bots.
[207:15.78]No laughing.
[207:16.20]And it might seem like the most mundane, boring thing in the world.
[207:20.01]But it actually is pretty addicting.
[207:21.63]They just keep coming out.
[207:22.69]You're on the red team.
[207:23.43]They're on the blue team.
[207:24.55]And it's just they walk in a straight line straight at you.
[207:27.11]And you can kind of make some adjustments.
[207:29.33]You can make them do jumps.
[207:30.27]You can make them move in a different direction.
[207:32.83]It's pretty fun. You'll find yourself just sitting there for what seems like hours shooting at these bots.
[207:39.00]And it's so important that you do this for a while and you practice inside a TR walkway-
[207:43.00]This good advice, what's wrong with this?
[207:49.82]This is not cringe.
[207:50.70]This is actually good advice.
[207:51.90]You'll go, oh, this guy's moving in the direction that I'm used to.
[207:55.02]I know where I'm supposed to place this because I know exactly how it's going to move.
[207:59.19]I know how the trajectory is going to go, and it's going to hit the guy, and he's going to die.
[208:02.83]And I'm going to get more points, and I'm going to do better in Team Fortress 2.
[208:06.85]And I mentioned why it's so important to be-
[208:08.00]Good advice is cringe.
[208:11.00]Because everybody always says that to get better at the game you gotta play, you gotta practice to get better. You just play and you get better.
[208:19.00]But it can be pretty damn hard sometimes, because when you get into a server and there's a bunch of people that are way better than you, you're not gonna get to practice your rocket launcher shots.
[208:27.00]Because they're gonna just kill you in less than a second-
[208:29.00]So true.
[208:30.00]And you're gonna start to feel bad. So what did- the bots don't attack back is the main thing.
[208:34.02]They just move and you can practice and it's a way better environment and a way better place to get comfortable with the way that these weapons actually work.
[208:42.00]That's right, yeah, of course it is.
[208:42.00]And you don't have to feel so pressured by going up against these guys that have been playing forever that know everything about every class.
[208:50.00]You can take your time with it and just sit sort of in a corner and just get used to the way the items-
[208:54.00]Guys, TF2 was out for three weeks after I made the- you know- I- come on.
[209:00.44]The game came out two weeks ago according to this video.
[209:04.62]But my pipes landed with Demoman has gone up significantly.
[209:08.94]Alright, we got two more.
[209:10.00]Told me I had a bigger purpose.
[209:12.18]He said, I'm gonna give you mortality and send you back to Earth to solve the world's problems.
[209:20.07]And I said, okay, send me back.
[209:23.35]Roger that.
[209:24.55]And I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for Baby Ninja Frog People.
[209:30.70]And I befriended the frogs.
[209:33.24]And they said, thank you.
[209:34.86]And I said, except for one frog named Timmy.
[209:37.56]He used to make fun of me.
[209:39.06]I can't veto anymore.
[209:40.68]He's dead.
[209:41.88]He's been dead for 70 years.
[209:43.35]Holy shit, has it really been that long?
[209:44.89]Hold on, let me look at my calendar here.
[209:47.19]the fuck are these drawings there's Jerma's birth there's uh my birthday wow really it's been like 82 years since I killed timmy hope his parents aren't that mad at me whatever let's get back into this so I got a job selling old shoes or I don't know you can put whatever you want here because I didn't have a job for the last like probably 40 years
[210:09.60]I got a job at a fishing dock.
[210:11.72]I was the guy that peeled all the fish's scales off.
[210:14.70]I used to eat them.
[210:15.92]It might be weird to a lot of you guys, but do you think I give a fuck?
[210:19.24]And then came my adult life.
[210:22.82]Um...
[210:26.01]There's context for these videos.
[210:27.63]I'm about to pause this motherfucker right now and drop some knowledge on you all, okay?
[210:47.31]Alright, listen to me.
[210:49.11]Alright, hold on a minute.
[210:51.49]Hold on, we're going to pause this.
[210:54.72]We're going to pause the timer too.
[210:57.90]It doesn't matter.
[210:58.28]There's not even that much time left in the video.
[211:00.02]Okay, so a long time ago, I had this character named Grandpa, right?
[211:05.13]Grandpa, I made videos for Machinima.
[211:08.13]And they did really, really well.
[211:09.95]I made, like, Grandpa as an MLG Pro.
[211:12.51]And holy fuck, people loved it.
[211:13.77]It got, like, 200,000 views.
[211:16.53]And remember, I was, like, a... I think I was, like, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 views a video on my YouTube channel.
[211:23.39]So, holy fucking smokes.
[211:25.48]I just leaned into it.
[211:26.66]I leaned into it hard.
[211:28.06]And I made, like, fucking 20 of these.
[211:30.88]So, I was like, holy shit, people like this.
[211:32.70]I'm going to keep making more of these Grandpa videos.
[211:37.28]So that's why this is here.
[211:38.68]People wanted to know more about him.
[211:43.14]Guys, I canonically killed this character twice.
[211:46.39]Grandpa's dead.
[211:48.39]He's canonically gone from the universe.
[211:52.65]Back into heaven, and then here's a funny story, guys.
[211:54.98]I was in Moses' science class, and guess who sits behind me but God himself.
[212:00.26]I walked up to him after class at his locker, and I just simply asked him, God, you know, could I have like five more years on Earth?
[212:07.03]And I had to trade my fucking Lunchables for it, but I'm here.
[212:10.33]There we go.
[212:13.87]Don't even need to do that.
[212:14.73]Uh-oh, it's Super Toothless Joe, whatever his name is.
[212:23.70]These guys freak me out.
[212:25.39]These guys are scary.
[212:27.13]This is a long time ago.
[212:30.17]I've had all the Warhammer games for a pretty long time.
[212:34.72]Super.
[212:35.82]Super.
[212:36.42]If you are a fan of RTS, I would highly recommend you get the original Dawn of War.
[212:44.30]I wasn't a fan of Dawn of War 2.
[212:45.47]This is bullshit.
[212:47.15]Old Isaac better than new Isaac.
[212:48.31]I thought Dawn of War 2 was a good game, but I don't think it was nearly as good as Dawn of War 1.
[212:53.05]What is this?
[212:54.45]And Grandpa tries.
[212:55.47]Just quit following me, dude.
[212:58.80]Come on.
[212:59.14]Come right here.
[213:00.20]Come on.
[213:00.88]You want to talk about leaning into it?
[213:02.60]Come on.
[213:03.08]Same era.
[213:03.64]Candy and soda and... Holy shit.
[213:06.38]This is the same era.
[213:07.70]I wasn't making that up.
[213:09.88]We were going to have a party down there, but you didn't feel like coming.
[213:13.41]We need to find that part.
[213:17.81]Fuck the timer.
[213:19.15]I'm freezing this.
[213:21.83]I'm literally gonna find where Grandpa plays because I want to show you guys what it really means to like grab onto something and fucking lean into it.
[213:28.24]In the title.
[213:35.68]It's in the title of the video, so that means you know it's about 4 to 10 seconds in the actual video.
[213:41.09]It's probably less than 20 seconds in the actual video.
[213:44.81]Where is it?
[213:47.05]Didn't they come out with a new map?
[213:50.47]Coldstream?
[213:52.23]Or Cold... Where's Grandpa?
[213:56.49]You know what?
[213:58.32]We might even do it again.
[213:59.88]Good position.
[214:00.90]Dimes.
[214:03.32]Lean into the sus guy.
[214:04.42]You don't think I've learned my lesson by now?
[214:09.70]Um, I've learned my lesson.
[214:13.10]Third or fourth room and I died.
[214:14.82]Whatever you're gonna do.
[214:15.68]Okay, so here we go.
[214:20.39]Up, down.
[214:21.09]That is it.
[214:22.17]Isaac.
[214:23.23]What's that?
[214:25.31]Just come down.
[214:27.29]Okay, let me just get over here.
[214:28.67]Get down here.
[214:28.95]You gotta play by- His grandpa's gonna play as-
[214:36.11]I want to know if it was requested.
[214:39.69]Gosh, darn it.
[214:40.93]If it was requested, I'm off the hook.
[214:49.96]Well, that's...
[214:52.34]If it was requested, I'm off the hook.
[214:53.86]So now we know what's gonna happen.
[214:55.88]His grandpa's gonna play as question mark, question mark, question mark.
[214:58.90]Shit, no.
[214:59.38]And that's gonna be the end of the stream.
[215:00.58]Jeremy, no.
[215:01.48]Somebody requested it.
[215:02.12]They're gonna go get grandpa.
[215:02.96]Grandpa can come in.
[215:04.13]And he'll sit down.
[215:04.77]He'll talk about how he loves this game.
[215:07.09]Not requested.
[215:09.17]We'll see what happens.
[215:10.19]Oh, goddammit.
[215:11.09]Hey, grandpa!
[215:13.39]Hey, you gotta get down here.
[215:14.31]You gotta play Binding of Isaac right now.
[215:21.00]unsolicited, unsolicited theater kid that just like needs to just perform and he doesn't care.
[215:29.59]Binding of Isaac.
[215:31.19]What's that?
[215:32.89]Just play it.
[215:33.67]Just sit down and play.
[215:35.19]Okay, I'll sit down.
[215:35.99]There we go.
[215:38.37]Okay.
[215:39.37]Hello.
[215:40.23]Let's play The Binding of Isaac.
[215:44.81]What?
[215:45.97]Did I just eat shit?
[215:47.95]What the hell was that?
[215:50.47]Alright, so what are the controls in this game?
[215:53.89]Up, down, left, right.
[215:56.01]Okay, so here we go.
[215:57.27]Up, down, left, right.
[215:59.27]Okay, good.
[216:00.77]Let's go this way.
[216:01.71]If I interact with myself like a dozen times, then it's pretty... I'm not upset about it.
[216:07.18]That's a spider.
[216:08.02]This game is stupid.
[216:10.22]What a dumb game.
[216:12.28]So, you just killed spiders and that's it?
[216:14.48]This is stupid.
[216:16.66]Why would you ever play this game?
[216:18.18]Okay, let's keep going.
[216:20.67]Oh, he's going to walk into it and die.
[216:23.01]And there's the title.
[216:24.73]Oh, that hurts you.
[216:25.57]There's the title.
[216:28.50]Am I going to die?
[216:29.60]Let's just go.
[216:30.28]Okay.
[216:31.14]I'm going to beat this entire game right now.
[216:33.16]Please stop, Jeremy.
[216:34.82]We need to suffer.
[216:35.78]We must suffer.
[216:38.56]Okay, so look, do I have like a farm right here?
[216:40.72]Or pet spiders?
[216:41.68]Okay, hey spiders.
[216:43.32]So today, I'm gonna feed you some little bugs and you're gonna eat them.
[216:49.50]Again.
[216:49.86]I'm gonna shoot that.
[216:52.58]So how do I, is this like a simulator?
[216:55.00]How do I get out of here?
[216:56.30]Lazybeam.
[216:57.20]Holy shit, it keeps going.
[216:59.16]Oh, this guy, what is with this guy?
[217:01.19]Okay, so how many lives do I get?
[217:04.05]I'm not going to do anything.
[217:05.03]I'm not there anymore, are they?
[217:06.47]See, I'll do it again.
[217:07.17]Get rid of all the stupid goddamn bugs.
[217:09.59]Did he die?
[217:11.23]What happened?
[217:13.84]Hello?
[217:21.18]See you later.
[217:21.92]We're doing it again.
[217:25.43]We're going to do it again.
[217:26.25]Go.
[217:30.09]Get out of my way!
[217:32.21]Get out of my way!
[217:32.93]There's actually this one Grandpa video that I really like.
[217:36.04]He plays Super Meat Boy, he dies in the first level, and he throws the controller through the window.
[217:40.78]Anybody find that one?
[217:41.74]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing.
[217:43.86]I'm telling you, I leaned into it.
[217:57.25]A lot of you guys stayed on this channel for Grandpa.
[218:02.47]Actually, you know, I can't talk shit about Grandpa.
[218:04.21]He literally launchpad my entire career online.
[218:09.29]If it wasn't for Grandpa, I don't even think I would have grown at the rate that I did.
[218:14.23]I really don't think so.
[218:16.45]I went from, like, 5,000 view YouTuber to, like, getting hundreds of thousands of views on videos because Grandpa was in them.
[218:24.12]It springboarded my whole career.
[218:26.22]I can't hate Grandpa.
[218:28.82]I can't.
[218:32.60]Somebody found it?
[218:33.10]Okay, well, we'll watch it in a second.
[218:38.66]Let's go.
[218:39.42]We have two more, and then that's it.
[218:41.52]I'm done.
[218:49.47]Here we go.
[218:54.07]Turn the timer on.
[218:55.19]We got two more of these.
[218:57.41]No, don't turn that off.
[218:58.61]You idiot.
[219:01.81]Invasion stuff, Jerm versus Star, and The Binding of Isaac.
[219:06.79]Yeah, that's a game that's really easy just to turn your brain off.
[219:11.90]If Grandpa shows up, I'm fucking leaving.
[219:15.12]For the last, like, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, I'm gonna play Diablo 3.
[219:20.77]Just kind of run around and swirl when people maybe.
[219:25.27]Maybe I'll play like Hearthstone and be terrible.
[219:27.77]No, I'd veto this whole thing.
[219:29.50]Hold on a second.
[219:30.24]In fact, delete this stream.
[219:32.12]Delete it.
[219:32.96]Like, what's the point?
[219:34.12]Get rid of this.
[219:34.54]Do you remember versus Star versus TF2?
[219:38.66]Wait.
[219:38.92]Do you remember versus Star versus TF2 and Binding of Isaac?
[219:42.17]What's that title supposed to mean?
[219:45.29]I don't have a game to show you.
[219:46.31]Look at this old, like, starting soon screen.
[219:52.53]I can either play Hearthstone and be terrible, Binding of Isaac, or Diablo.
[219:57.49]Which one?
[220:00.29]Those are all awful choices.
[220:02.45]Honestly, if I'm in the stream, I'm hitting the X. And I'm going to warn you guys.
[220:07.52]Watching me play Hearthstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy.
[220:11.40]I didn't even hear that.
[220:12.02]I've been gone for at least 30 seconds.
[220:16.09]I'll come back and see if he's playing Isaac later.
[220:17.97]I'm going to do one of those fancy polls that you see from time to time.
[220:26.62]He couldn't do comedy without Grandpa.
[220:29.34]Grandpa was sort of an outlet to be a weirdo.
[220:35.86]It really was.
[220:36.74]I didn't even, guys, I didn't, there was a period from when I first started doing YouTube videos.
[220:42.70]I started out kind of, like, vulgar.
[220:45.26]Like, I did, like, vulgar, like, swears and stuff.
[220:47.64]And then, like, six months after I started YouTube, I went to no swears.
[220:54.38]Completely, like, PG, PG-13.
[220:56.60]I didn't say, like, fuck.
[220:57.68]I didn't say shit.
[220:59.24]I said, like, crap.
[221:00.06]And, like, oh, like, freaking and stuff.
[221:02.16]I didn't swear.
[221:04.24]I used grandpa as a means to just say and do whatever I wanted.
[221:08.79]And you have 30 seconds to vote, by the way.
[221:13.20]You have 30 seconds to vote on this poll.
[221:15.22]Because it's grandpa.
[221:16.36]It's not me.
[221:20.26]It was a period of, like, at least a year or two where I didn't swear.
[221:22.40]And then, Ster made a video of all this, like, footage.
[221:27.16]Ster made a video of all this footage of, like, him recording me and, like, being, like, me freaking out and, like, saying swears and just kind of uncensored.
[221:37.30]And then I couldn't be that guy anymore.
[221:39.76]know what I mean when you have me like calling Ster like a piece of garbage and I'm like I I want to like attack him with like a hammer or whatever like I'm gonna put cigarettes out like you know what I mean like you can't be the guy that doesn't swear anymore after that right well I could not keep that up after that it was exposed so
[222:04.78]Why are these trees made out of fucking sheets?
[222:07.54]Give me a real tree, please.
[222:09.40]God damn it.
[222:11.06]How could you get mad at me?
[222:11.68]They're not even real trees.
[222:12.60]What the fuck are these?
[222:13.59]What are they?
[222:14.29]How do you get mad at Minecraft?
[222:15.53]How do you get- I'm working with a fucking knife and I'm stabbing a motherfucker in the chest, I swear to God.
[222:23.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[222:25.19]What?
[222:26.32]What is he saying?
[222:37.00]What?
[222:38.44]You were shit-faced?
[222:43.04]Fucking eat my asshole.
[222:44.32]Seriously, my god.
[222:46.97]I have to feed her this one.
[222:52.45]What the hell was that?
[222:53.03]An apple?
[222:53.81]Fucking shove it up your ass.
[222:54.81]Who cares?
[222:56.54]How do I eat it?
[222:59.92]What's wrong with me?
[223:00.92]Why am I so mad?
[223:14.79]Where's pgjerma?
[223:16.15]Blamester!
[223:17.55]He caught me on camera talking about, like, cigarette butts being put on, like, my dick and shit, and I was over!
[223:22.62]I turned into this guy!
[223:24.12]I would have been, like, PG Andy!
[223:26.56]I brought, I, I, what, my career, I don't know what my career would have looked like after that.
[223:31.56]Digging straight down.
[223:32.60]Yeah, that's fine.
[223:33.78]We'll be fine.
[223:37.10]I would probably have, like, a hundred million views on my videos playing Fortnite.
[223:42.95]I would have been like, I don't know.
[223:44.62]What would I have done?
[223:53.72]If I didn't go down that route, what road would I have been on?
[223:59.75]He's still here.
[224:00.29]Okay.
[224:02.41]I ain't going to fuck this up again.
[224:08.43]Ster saved this channel.
[224:11.71]I don't think I would have done that, though.
[224:14.35]Now let's go get some goddamn armor.
[224:16.55]What do you say?
[224:17.03]Well, I don't know.
[224:17.81]I can't tell you the different multiverses.
[224:20.99]Would I have... Okay, if Ster didn't make Jerma is Mad 1, 2, 3, and 4... Make how?
[224:26.35]Would I have been playing Among Us and leaned into the sus guy?
[224:33.35]Jesus.
[224:35.47]That's something to think about.
[224:42.10]What is that noise?
[224:42.82]What the fuck is this noise?
[224:45.96]Why does this look like ass too?
[224:47.72]Okay.
[224:48.52]Keep going.
[224:49.51]It's so blurry and like zoomed in.
[224:52.75]What do you say gamers?
[224:54.21]Just wait.
[224:55.07]Just give me a minute.
[224:55.67]Alright.
[224:57.11]This is the final one.
[224:57.94]We're ending on this one.
[224:59.26]This is it.
[224:59.62]Whatever it is.
[225:02.75]In the description.
[225:04.17]It's a horror game.
[225:05.31]Oh my fucking god.
[225:06.01]And apparently it's one of the scariest damn games ever made.
[225:10.02]Now, I don't do well with these types of games.
[225:11.94]And as you can see, I'm down the first flight of stairs and I already don't want to play.
[225:16.28]Is that a... Is that a can of easy cheese?
[225:20.28]In case something crazy happens.
[225:21.76]What's that can of cheese?
[225:23.88]So, let's get started.
[225:25.99]And to try not to psych myself out while I do this, I'm gonna give you the...
[225:31.33]backstory of the game.
[225:33.99]So, pretty much, this game... I already don't want to do this.
[225:39.45]What's this room?
[225:40.32]This is my old room.
[225:41.78]From like 12 years ago.
[225:44.40]19 year old Jerma... No, not that young.
[225:48.68]He said he did it on coffee breaks.
[225:50.86]And it's a stairway...
[225:58.25]Somebody's coming behind me right now.
[225:59.67]Unmade bed?
[226:01.37]Yeah, who cares?
[226:02.63]Unmade bed?
[226:03.45]Who gives a shit?
[226:04.01]This is really all you do.
[226:07.37]God.
[226:08.09]God damn it.
[226:10.13]Who fucking makes their bed?
[226:11.37]Nobody.
[226:14.79]I can't stop moving now.
[226:16.13]This is literally acting.
[226:16.97]I'm faking this whole thing, aren't I?
[226:18.25]Look at me.
[226:19.59]I don't know how long.
[226:20.37]Dude, this could last less than three minutes.
[226:23.48]This could end.
[226:24.10]I might just rage to quit.
[226:32.84]Look at how I do look so young though.
[226:34.63]I was probably 25.
[226:35.93]Maybe 25, 26.
[226:36.09]Jesus.
[226:36.33]Why are you so caked?
[226:38.61]Because I was in the gym every day.
[226:54.79]And the goal is to see how far you can go down, how many stairs you can go down.
[226:59.47]I'm at floor number six and I'm almost ready to just quit this game.
[227:06.22]And it messes with me too.
[227:07.94]I keep on repeating myself probably, but that's because I am terrified right now.
[227:12.54]You look like you sniffed radioactive material.
[227:15.18]Having somebody else in the room with me, let alone a game like this.
[227:18.22]It's called, I don't, I didn't white balance my cameras.
[227:21.79]And the screen is like green.
[227:27.63]floor eight extend alright fine no I need like ten people in the room with me to all be like hanging out because this is just this is me by myself with headphones on how was that yeah which sucks I it's okay here's thing it's a lot different streaming a horror game then recording a video for a horror game because like I don't feel alone when I stream it but I am alone when I record it that's the worst part about this stuff is getting just loud and horrible
[227:57.36]It's different.
[227:58.12]It is.
[227:58.30]You look like you're wearing eye shadow.
[228:05.11]I think I just have that.
[228:05.83]I'm just young.
[228:06.59]You just don't know when.
[228:24.29]So, I'm gonna... If you hit escape, you end the game.
[228:28.25]Hitting escape ends it.
[228:29.91]Yeah, I know that everybody... The meme was, like, you have a toilet paper roll and, like, lotion behind you.
[228:36.72]And, like, a can of Easy Cheese.
[228:38.80]I don't know.
[228:39.12]Whatever the fuck that is.
[228:42.56]I don't know if it's in this video or not.
[228:43.86]Is that toilet paper back there next to the bed?
[228:45.56]Oh!
[228:51.72]Oh, my God.
[228:59.67]You knew it was gonna happen at some point.
[229:01.07]You just didn't know when.
[229:01.91]I'm at floor 20.
[229:03.15]I wanna- I'm done.
[229:04.11]Floor 20.
[229:05.31]Floor 20.
[229:06.44]I've lost that accent in the last 10 to 15 years.
[229:09.48]Holy shit.
[229:10.62]Can't give up that easily.
[229:12.32]This stuff is gonna get much- I don't even wanna go down.
[229:22.16]God.
[229:22.60]This is not even that long of a video.
[229:24.36]God.
[229:25.76]You bastard.
[229:28.08]You son of a bitch.
[229:34.45]You have a Vegas accent now?
[229:36.17]There is no Vegas accent.
[229:37.87]I don't think I'll be able to... I don't think I'll be able to go past 30.
[229:41.79]We want 10 more clips.
[229:43.72]What is that?
[229:44.66]It's the shadow of the... That's the first time I saw that.
[229:48.82]There's no more timer?
[229:49.78]Where is it going to go?
[229:52.86]Timer was fun.
[229:53.98]I'm giving 100 community subs from the bingo.
[229:57.31]No more bingo.
[229:58.55]We'll just play some.
[229:59.87]We'll do it like 5-10 more times.
[230:04.46]Let's kill that timer.
[230:06.26]See, the shadows are really starting to mess with you now.
[230:08.88]Like, the shadows are really starting to kick in and really starting to freak you out.
[230:11.79]This shows you just how much horror games have evolved in the last 10 years.
[230:15.97]People were freaking out over a little mask on a staircase.
[230:22.17]In Outlast 2, you, like, birthed a demon baby.
[230:26.61]I can't even look at the screen.
[230:27.85]I can't.
[230:29.06]I seriously can't look at the screen.
[230:32.74]My whole body is, like, hurts right now.
[230:34.61]What did I turn off?
[230:40.85]What is that?
[230:41.55]That's a face.
[230:43.23]Oh my god!
[230:43.91]That's, like, that's not even, like, scary anymore.
[230:49.46]That's, like, just a guy.
[230:51.10]Alright, what's on the back there?
[230:53.00]What is that?
[230:53.56]It's, like, a fucking orange juice.
[230:55.72]It's, like, a...
[230:58.87]It's like an orange juice.
[231:00.88]A fucking Omega Bible.
[231:03.14]What's this Omega Bible?
[231:04.70]Like, I don't know what this is.
[231:07.62]What is this?
[231:09.46]A Minute Maid?
[231:10.26]Like a hairspray?
[231:11.46]A huge thing of lotion, tissues.
[231:14.86]I don't know what this even is.
[231:17.22]I think this is cheese.
[231:18.30]No, this is like, no, what is this?
[231:20.41]It's like oil for your car?
[231:23.20]What is this spray?
[231:25.08]Like CBD spray?
[231:27.30]This is a padlock.
[231:28.97]This is a fucking padlock.
[231:30.89]I don't know what that goes to.
[231:32.49]Coffee mug.
[231:33.17]I don't know what all this stuff even is supposed to be.
[231:38.17]I have no idea.
[231:42.39]There's a shelf here with... I don't know what this... Is that a bell pepper?
[231:47.59]It's a car?
[231:48.27]Guys, I have no idea.
[231:52.47]You just didn't have it together at all.
[231:56.45]Hold on, what's it- do I move to see the other side?
[231:58.47]Let me see the other side.
[232:01.05]Is this like a fucking- is this like cigarette juice?
[232:06.43]Was I dipping and like spitting tobacco into this thing?
[232:09.19]What is that?
[232:12.71]Is it dog food on the ground?
[232:14.31]What was- hold on.
[232:15.70]What is this?
[232:16.22]Is it like rat shit down here?
[232:19.06]What is this?
[232:19.52]What are these pellets?
[232:23.50]I don't.
[232:24.34]Guys, I have absolutely no idea.
[232:26.06]It's soy sauce.
[232:28.18]Hold on.
[232:28.60]Oh my god, Jeremy.
[232:34.68]Hold on.
[232:35.06]Move.
[232:35.97]Move the head.
[232:36.41]I think that's cologne.
[232:40.75]Move.
[232:44.09]Is this a candle?
[232:47.27]I think this is like Vic's vapor rub.
[232:52.45]Oh boy.
[233:08.84]This Listen to me.
[233:10.74]Okay.
[233:11.02]This is really important.
[233:12.08]I don't know why this is in the room I have no idea what it's doing in the room But listen, this is dog vitamins.
[233:19.85]I
[233:24.38]This is a big pump of omega-3 for dogs.
[233:30.02]I don't know if I was eating this.
[233:31.16]I don't think I was eating this, but I mean, it's possible I might have been.
[233:35.48]I don't think I was eating that, but like... It's a huge pump for... It's not lotion.
[233:41.97]It's literally fucking dog vitamins.
[233:51.48]I don't know why it's so big.
[233:54.32]It's exposed.
[233:55.52]It says it was omega-3 dog pump vitamins.
[233:58.52]I have no idea what that is, and I don't even know what the hat was either.
[234:01.38]It's like a gas station hat.
[234:02.72]I don't know what that even is.
[234:03.84]I can't even make out what the fuck this is on my head.
[234:09.71]Is this like a, like, valvaline?
[234:13.25]What is this?
[234:19.31]Okay.
[234:23.06]Is this like a Jiffy Lube hat?
[234:27.56]I don't even know what that is.
[234:28.75]Okay, we're going to do another one.
[234:33.99]Let's just go again.
[234:34.85]Oh, nice dusk.
[234:43.21]There's a Jax moment.
[234:44.13]We can add it.
[234:55.03]Why did you have dog vit- I don't know.
[234:58.67]Stuff just kind of accumulates in random places.
[235:01.08]Yeah, and the tissues and the dog vitamin lotion was in a really weird place, I understand.
[235:12.30]But I'm not- I wasn't just sitting there, I- Oh my goodness.
[235:25.33]I don't think I was eating it.
[235:30.41]It had to be a reason why it was there.
[235:33.84]Right next to the bed, though.
[235:35.00]What is it doing there?
[235:39.41]Keep a timer on so you don't stay for too long.
[235:42.39]I can keep an eye on it.
[235:45.32]It was lotion?
[235:46.18]It was not.
[235:47.18]What lotion company do you know that makes a weird, gigantic, like, coffee syrup pump like that?
[235:54.35]That's that big with a long neck?
[235:56.27]They don't make it like that.
[235:59.41]With the yellow front?
[236:02.15]No, they don't have, like, the big, long, fucking turkey neck.
[236:05.97]It wasn't lotion, it was dog vitamins.
[236:09.25]It was a dog vitamin omega-3 pump.
[236:12.11]That's a lot.
[236:14.59]We are now at creations.
[236:18.07]Something else that's kind of funny to note, and I will give you a little bit more ammo to fire at me.
[236:23.81]The tissue box was empty.
[236:25.11]It depends.
[236:26.09]Wow.
[236:27.13]Must have been really fucking good.
[236:28.29]Must have been really going for it.
[236:30.01]There's nothing left in there.
[236:31.05]I got the hallowed health.
[236:32.95]Yeah, how do you respond to that?
[236:39.11]God.
[236:39.45]Alright, well, this is me playing Dusk, whatever.
[236:41.60]I'm good at this game.
[236:46.09]Oh, this is a classic.
[236:46.91]I love this one.
[236:52.96]Has this game seen any updates?
[236:58.02]I feel like this game is really fun.
[236:59.70]Where's the other wrestler?
[237:11.25]Oh, they were invisible.
[237:13.01]Right, I forgot.
[237:14.11]They're invisible.
[237:20.66]You can make the characters invisible.
[237:28.58]Wrestling Empire got an update?
[237:30.12]Yeah, that game was the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[237:34.06]Alright, let's go again.
[237:37.17]Skip.
[237:38.82]little set of clips here.
[237:40.06]Especially in this first one, I killed like nine people in a row.
[237:43.56]And really, after playing with this for maybe an hour or two, I think it took me maybe an hour to get this gameplay.
[237:49.16]So after playing with this for a little while, I've come to the realization that I want to do this with the Carnivorous Kunai.
[237:56.28]Get a backstab on somebody and just go for the headshots.
[238:00.01]Alright, fuck off.
[238:01.63]Yes!
[238:02.21]This guy's shitfaced, so he'll be easy.
[238:09.03]I love it.
[238:09.47]Classic.
[238:10.73]I want to just, please, I need to make, I want more of these.
[238:16.56]I would pay a hundred dollars retail for one of these.
[238:19.68]Another one.
[238:22.28]I would pay a thousand dollars.
[238:23.18]No, that's way too much.
[238:23.96]I'd pay, I'd pay a hundred bucks for one of these.
[238:27.08]I'm planning on it.
[238:29.14]Did he just not even shoot the gun?
[238:33.64]There's a time for living.
[238:34.68]There's a time for dying.
[238:36.40]And your time has come.
[238:41.31]Is it in the book?
[238:41.85]IT'S IN THE BOOK!
[238:42.63]I KNEW IT WAS IN THE BOOK!
[238:43.67]I KNEW IT WAS IN THE FUCKING BOOK!
[238:45.33]And now I lost, and it's over.
[238:50.31]Man, I wanna- okay.
[239:00.12]I wanna, like, see some other streamers play these games, you know what I mean?
[239:03.01]Top quality acting job, lady.
[239:05.87]Which one is it?
[239:06.79]Remember when we talked about sharing things?
[239:12.09]I would love to see other people play this.
[239:14.17]I want to watch streamers play this.
[239:16.67]Seriously, she ran out of there with a Scrooge McDuck bag.
[239:19.15]You're not going to fool me.
[239:21.13]What about this guy?
[239:22.03]Vinny is a connoisseur of old, obscure, interesting shit.
[239:25.87]That doesn't surprise me.
[239:26.75]He has a 500 fucking IQ brain.
[239:28.15]That does not surprise me.
[239:28.93]That guy missed.
[239:35.83]That guy shot the ground.
[239:37.14]They shoot the ground.
[239:39.84]This is stupid.
[239:40.28]That guy shot directly into the dirt.
[239:42.04]Why is that guy a quick draw, fast McGraw?
[239:45.76]No, we need to gatekeep.
[239:47.12]No, shut up.
[239:49.03]No gatekeeping video games.
[239:51.59]I have no idea what this guy just said.
[239:53.01]Hold on, wait.
[239:55.19]That's one of my favorite lines.
[239:57.47]So your mama let you come out and play today.
[239:59.49]Why is that guy a quick draw, fast McGraw?
[240:02.84]That doesn't make any sense.
[240:07.94]I have no idea what this guy just said.
[240:09.36]Yeah, this could be... Imagine trying to get the fastest record in the world here.
[240:14.30]She's going to be quick.
[240:21.95]Oh, there's a mattress, right?
[240:23.95]You see that mattress behind her?
[240:26.37]That's like a stunt mattress.
[240:30.31]I love it.
[240:31.85]I'm glad you fell on that stunt mattress inside of a saloon.
[240:34.93]Don't you shoot it out of his hand?
[240:43.31]I forgot about that one.
[240:44.49]That was a channel meme five, six, seven years ago for a long time.
[240:48.82]You can't tell somebody to holster the gun and then shoot.
[240:56.64]Come on now.
[240:56.96]Wasn't that a sub sound for a while?
[241:02.37]It was, wasn't it?
[241:02.95]Yeah, it was.
[241:04.29]Alright, moving on.
[241:05.13]2014.
[241:08.21]This was such a pain in the ass to edit.
[241:31.34]Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way.
[241:35.24]Meanwhile, Grandpa, not paying any attention to who's behind him.
[241:38.64]That's Batboy with a clothesline.
[241:41.45]He's supposed to be dead.
[241:42.91]Batboy is supposed to be dead right now.
[241:45.35]But for some reason, he just snuck up behind him.
[241:47.05]Is he even supposed to be in this?
[241:48.79]He's not.
[241:50.23]Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet is over on the left side fighting right now.
[241:56.01]And Batboy is in the ring.
[241:57.35]Does this even qualify as a match anymore?
[241:59.11]I'm not sure.
[242:00.00]So back after 2013, it wasn't just a rumble.
[242:04.70]It was like, oh, I want to do a bunch of matches and have a big storyline.
[242:10.38]And the thing about the old wrestling, like WWE 2K14, 2K13, you know, the good ones where before they've ruined everything and the game was a piece of absolute steaming fucking garbage.
[242:22.07]So before that,
[242:24.17]You could, there was like these little like clip mode where you could put wrestlers in and make a little scene.
[242:33.81]And you could create and craft these weird, it was like the movies.
[242:37.89]Where it's like, here's a scenario, who do you want to be as, like mannequins are standing in and you can just make up your own little storylines.
[242:45.69]There were like dozens and dozens of clips.
[242:50.17]And then they made it a sports simulation Madden game that we just update the roster and the game breaks half the time.
[242:55.77]It was so good.
[242:57.77]It was awesome.
[242:58.45]Half of the clips that you see in these old Jerma Rumble videos were sort of stringed together in that weird sort of puzzle of putting a little scene together.
[243:03.83]And I would cut it and I would put it into the actual match.
[243:20.71]See, they were just wrestling, but this was edited in.
[243:24.23]This was not just part of the match.
[243:26.11]I had to go in and piece this together.
[243:28.01]It was so much fun to do.
[243:28.75]And then they got rid of it.
[243:29.73]Poor grandpa.
[243:48.86]The new one coming out - I am going to hold my breath completely.
[243:51.00]Hold on.
[243:53.00]I think if we can't get a hold of captain crunch, no one's heard of him in like six weeks and the egg went to dinner with his wife and it's gonna have to be you in the ladder match. It is.
[243:59.00]You just tell me when to go I'm ready I'll be here I'll be in the backstage I'll be ready whenever you need-
[244:06.00]What a bunch of bullshit.
[244:08.00]Oh yeah that's when I was huge.
[244:11.00]This is still going on? This is still going on backstage? They're still beating the out of each other?
[244:15.00]What, he's gonna put his head in a car?
[244:19.18]I'm going to hold my breath on any new wrestling game that comes out, because I feel like they've lost their way completely across every single piece of media.
[244:28.70]From the shit that's on TV, from the shit that you play in your home on your console, they've lost their way 100%.
[244:35.07]Some of these new organizations are starting to try to be a little bit more fun and interesting, but no.
[244:40.63]No, I'm going to hold my breath.
[244:44.52]You go back to the way that, like, kind of, they used to do this shit back in, like, 2013, 2012, 2014.
[244:49.80]I know that the company that used to work on these games split off.
[244:54.81]Right?
[244:54.95]Was it AKI?
[244:56.55]Whatever it was.
[244:57.07]What's the name of the company?
[244:59.45]They said, we keep making the same fucking game over and over again.
[245:05.64]And...
[245:07.73]It's Yuke's, yeah, Yuke's.
[245:08.71]A.K.A.
[245:08.97]I was the other company that worked on it, right?
[245:11.79]They made like a statement saying, hey, we're going to make our own wrestling game, we think.
[245:15.69]Because we just keep doing the same shit with these WWE games.
[245:19.71]I have such high hopes, but I don't want to have, like I'm holding my breath again, that they're going to bring this kind of crazy shit back.
[245:28.67]And yeah, THQ, everybody gave shit to THQ, but man, wasn't that kind of like a turning point when THQ went away?
[245:37.28]I feel like we lost a lot of kind of really wacky, creative, fun shit that that studio was doing.
[245:45.13]The people gave a lot of shit to THQ.
[245:46.86]Ah, their games are fucking terrible.
[245:48.06]They're like 7s out of 10, 6s out of 10.
[245:49.96]They're like kind of shitty and dumb.
[245:51.90]I look back at the catalog that THQ had.
[245:53.76]It was pretty phenomenal.
[246:01.08]And I even remember being one of these people that's like, oh, THQ went out of business.
[246:04.42]Ah, whatever.
[246:04.88]Who cares?
[246:06.17]I guess they were okay.
[246:08.07]But if you actually go back to see the influence that they had on the industry and all the stuff that they were making, it's like, holy fuck, they had a lot to do with why shit was even, people were even making fun games in the first place.
[246:25.94]It was one of the last remaining AA studios.
[246:28.24]Yeah.
[246:28.38]Yeah.
[246:34.08]I wish they would make a revival.
[246:35.32]I wish somebody would buy them and just let them kind of go again.
[246:41.56]It's kind of like a weird... THQ Nordic is making a comeback.
[246:46.81]Yeah, I hope so.
[246:49.85]It's the new revival.
[246:50.75]What are they making?
[246:51.29]What are they working on?
[246:51.85]They're doing TimeSplitters 3.
[247:02.62]Destroy all humans?
[247:04.46]Yeah, I hope so.
[247:05.38]Because they were just really creative, funny things and fun stuff.
[247:09.29]Look, we've kind of gotten into this mode in video games now where I think a lot of these companies are taking themselves way too seriously.
[247:18.55]Like everything's being taken way too seriously.
[247:22.13]It's got to be like this.
[247:23.01]It has to be like this.
[247:23.79]It's got to get done.
[247:24.55]It's got to be like... I kind of miss like when devs kind of just fucked around and made fun shit because they wanted to.
[247:33.92]The indie scene is still doing that, right?
[247:36.64]But it's almost like there's just two.
[247:39.06]It's like indie games and just AAA games, right?
[247:41.75]It's like we lost that AA kind of mentality.
[247:44.05]I hope it comes back.
[247:51.57]Anyways, let's press the button again.
[248:02.90]How can you say the AA studios don't exist when Game Freak still makes Pokémon?
[248:07.18]Ah, but Pokémon is like a monster property owned by Nintendo.
[248:13.02]I mean, I can't speak to... Oh, that was an insult.
[248:16.25]Oh, okay.
[248:16.77]That was an insult.
[248:18.77]It's okay.
[248:21.35]That was insulting.
[248:22.49]I get it.
[248:23.23]Okay.
[248:24.57]I'm going to click the button.
[248:29.81]Yeah, oh, please don't kill me.
[248:31.45]Please, please don't kill me.
[248:36.37]I'm gonna, no, he's gonna get away.
[248:38.29]Here, if you think that that's, like, stupid.
[248:41.65]That's, like, one of the most catchiest songs I've ever heard in my life.
[248:44.75]What is?
[248:45.75]So, I'm sorry, I listen to that sometimes.
[248:47.25]What song?
[248:47.93]I need to know.
[248:50.46]Of course, I listen to Freddie Dredd, too.
[248:53.16]Freddie Dredd's music.
[248:55.32]I'm just saying that because he just gave 50 community subs.
[248:57.64]I don't care.
[249:04.47]care enough to tell you that.
[249:11.37]Aren't you curious?
[249:12.27]Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
[249:15.25]Oh, based.
[249:16.43]That's my kind of music.
[249:17.57]Based.
[249:18.95]Yep.
[249:23.03]Absolutely 100% based.
[249:24.29]Wait, we have to actually feed the fire?
[249:30.96]Alright, open.
[249:31.34]Open.
[249:33.43]Okay, before we start baking, the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature.
[249:36.79]I'm glad we did this again.
[249:37.71]The thermometer on the left side of the oven.
[249:42.29]As time progresses, the oven will slowly run out of fuel.
[249:44.48]Make sure to add logs from time to time to keep the fire going.
[249:47.08]The pizza one, right?
[249:51.90]Get it in there.
[249:52.36]To do it again?
[249:52.86]Alright, get it in the green.
[249:55.91]Yeah, I want enough time to pass where we don't overdo it, though.
[250:01.33]A wood-fired pizza?
[250:02.25]Yeah, that's the best.
[250:03.78]Again.
[250:05.81]Dual comm with Shibby2142.
[250:07.69]There might just be a GG right here.
[250:10.26]Yeah.
[250:12.12]It's kind of rolling through.
[250:13.50]By the way, let me just tell you this right now.
[250:15.14]I remember this video.
[250:16.02]Let's go take that last point.
[250:17.44]I remember this specifically.
[250:18.64]And you know why I remember this specifically?
[250:20.22]Because this was like a holy shit.
[250:21.42]This is a big deal.
[250:22.78]Shibby... This is back when I had like 500 subs on YouTube.
[250:28.59]Back in like 2010, 2011, whatever it was.
[250:30.83]Shibby was killing it.
[250:31.91]Shibby had like 30,000 subs.
[250:34.51]50,000 subs.
[250:36.05]And he like reached out.
[250:37.87]He was like, hey, maybe we should do a video sometime.
[250:39.59]And I looked at his channel and I was like...
[250:41.73]It's like, holy shit.
[250:42.90]This guy, this guy, this is a god.
[250:45.32]You've got 50 fucking thousand subs on YouTube.
[250:47.70]Are you kidding me?
[250:49.50]Oh, yeah.
[250:50.82]Oh, sure.
[250:51.42]We'll make a video.
[250:54.41]Shibby then went on to work at Machinima.
[250:58.19]And then he started working at other companies.
[250:59.57]And he's like in the industry now.
[251:02.82]Like, I think like talent management shit.
[251:08.74]Shibby's a good dude.
[251:10.98]I've talked to him recently.
[251:15.12]He was always really supportive of the channel.
[251:18.93]Even when he moved on to do the stuff in the industry.
[251:20.95]We would talk, we would hang out.
[251:25.93]I was really excited to do this because I was like, holy shit, this is a huge YouTuber.
[251:31.67]We would just want to sit in the rain all day.
[251:35.34]Oh, stereotyping a city.
[251:37.42]Oh, damn.
[251:39.37]And, by the way, I'm nervous in this video.
[251:41.25]I'm like, holy fuck, I better be funny and good.
[251:42.89]I have to, like, be good.
[251:43.63]Like, I'm gonna be medic and just, like, heal him.
[251:45.86]I'm gonna heal the fuck out of him as medic and hopefully he likes me.
[251:48.26]I'm gonna switch demo.
[251:49.24]We got three medics right now.
[251:53.31]It's down, it's down.
[251:54.41]Oh, maybe if I do good and I heal him and we have a good conversation, he'll talk to me again.
[251:58.19]Oh, another one!
[251:59.27]Look at how much fun he sounds like he's having.
[252:00.92]This is awesome.
[252:01.66]Yes, he's having fun.
[252:02.44]He's kidding me.
[252:05.42]75 FOV.
[252:06.56]Yikes.
[252:07.12]That's right.
[252:08.28]This is 70 FOV.
[252:12.04]Default weapon Andy.
[252:13.18]This is before they did an update where the Demoman got new items, guys.
[252:17.38]The Demoman didn't even have new stuff to play with.
[252:19.65]This is just the game.
[252:20.45]Go, go.
[252:21.15]Come on, shibs.
[252:24.05]Oh, Gabe's doing work.
[252:26.15]We got this.
[252:26.65]We got this.
[252:28.31]Where's that sentry?
[252:29.91]Not true.
[252:30.47]I think it... I don't remember the Demoman had a new item.
[252:32.59]He's trying to move it up here.
[252:34.37]If there was, there was only like one or two.
[252:35.65]There's so many guys.
[252:37.23]You have the... Oh.
[252:37.89]Oh, wow.
[252:38.43]Yeah, but there probably was only like three items.
[252:44.36]Oh, teleporter and sentry's down.
[252:46.44]Oh.
[252:50.40]What was the point of me getting...
[252:52.61]I remember this.
[252:53.11]This game is awful.
[252:56.95]Sticky spamming in a pub.
[252:58.87]That just scared the shit out of me.
[253:01.77]The you left the menu sound scared the fuck out of me.
[253:05.58]I can't even see what's going on.
[253:10.24]I feel like I'm shit-faced watching an old CRT TV.
[253:15.82]With one eye open.
[253:16.66]Lying down.
[253:21.24]So what is the key for?
[253:23.28]This is the last one, whatever it is, we're going out on it.
[253:27.41]Play it really at all, but kind of a little bit, because we're going to talk about something today that I noticed.
[253:32.97]And it's when you notice these things that you start to go, why the hell am I doing that?
[253:37.17]And it freaks you out, because you start thinking about it every time you do it.
[253:40.02]What I'm talking about is weird, obsessive-compulsive habits that we have when we play video games.
[253:47.00]Oh no.
[253:47.62]It doesn't have to be just Team Fortress 2.
[253:49.26]It doesn't have to be just an MMO or an action game.
[253:52.32]This is across the board.
[253:53.62]It's just a different quirk.
[253:55.71]It's just a different compulsive thing.
[253:57.67]Con.
[253:58.11]Yeah, I know.
[254:00.43]Ooh.
[254:05.22]This game was a... This was awesome.
[254:07.14]I loved this game for a while.
[254:08.36]Oh, there we go.
[254:09.50]He's doing it.
[254:10.92]No, I did it again.
[254:11.92]The rock is back in Ohio.
[254:14.68]I keep doing that.
[254:15.60]I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing.
[254:17.72]It was just one hit kill only railgun.
[254:20.86]It was so much fun.
[254:21.86]Okay, good.
[254:23.66]Good.
[254:23.86]I didn't like... Rats instagib.
[254:24.74]No, I didn't.
[254:25.14]I didn't click.
[254:30.92]Bring this back.
[254:32.56]Bring this game back.
[254:36.64]I mean, this game was fucking unbelievable.
[254:41.19]Should I bring this back?
[254:44.05]New Twitch meta, you think?
[254:45.37]I think it has an opportunity to be one.
[254:48.03]I hit the fucking pole.
[254:50.32]I hit the pole.
[254:51.20]This really could be one of these kind of new meta Twitch metas.
[254:54.08]Alright, hold on to this thought.
[254:59.63]Imagine the tournament type shit you could do.
[255:02.75]Tournaments with this would be insane.
[255:06.63]You should have seen that shot from my perspective.
[255:08.77]I'll work on it.
[255:09.21]From my perspective, it looked like I hit you.
[255:13.40]You could do kind of like a bunny hop rocket jump.
[255:16.30]I am ready to go.
[255:18.52]Yeah.
[255:18.64]Think you're going to pull that on me?
[255:20.24]You're going to pull a me on you?
[255:21.48]You're going to pull me on you?
[255:23.34]You got to hit up Ludwig.
[255:24.32]I'm not going to pull me on you.
[255:27.73]Ludwig, I've got another harebrained idea for you.
[255:31.63]It's called Rats Instagram.
[255:33.17]Get 40 people to fucking show up.
[255:39.06]You're just sitting behind the goddamn couch like a freaking prick.
[255:42.58]Alright, last one, whatever it is, is it?
[255:46.36]Classic.
[255:47.34]We're leaving on this.
[255:48.06]I know, I realize it's Adam Sandler.
[255:50.70]Oh.
[255:50.80]Oh.
[256:08.92]Oh, this clock is broken.
[256:12.51]Oh, it's all over me.
[256:17.39]Oh, what do I do?
[256:19.11]Reparo.
[256:21.79]Oh, come on now.
[256:23.01]Can you use the sight?
[256:25.12]Yeah.
[256:26.84]What the fuck is this?
[256:30.84]No, one more.
[256:33.22]Nah, this isn't a bad game.
[256:34.48]This is weird.
[256:35.12]I was just making a reference to the fact that all the recent Tony Hawk games have been fucking awful.
[256:39.87]What is this?
[256:41.47]This game just is a thousand times more difficult than Tony Hawk.
[256:44.83]Skate 3?
[256:47.79]I didn't play this.
[256:48.63]Let's go back to the marker.
[256:53.62]I don't... This is not even my video.
[256:55.32]I think this is wrong.
[256:56.60]I think the... It's somebody else's stream, I think.
[256:59.46]I don't think I have enough speed here.
[257:02.66]No, I don't.
[257:06.00]Let's do a pumpy.
[257:06.62]Yeah, this is not even my... I didn't stream this.
[257:10.72]Alright, let's go.
[257:16.11]This is what, okay, for all the new viewers, this was considered one of the worst streams I've ever done.
[257:24.36]Okay.
[257:25.54]I spent... How long is this?
[257:27.66]Two hours and 32 minutes and it's just me being bad and talking about how the game sucks.
[257:32.20]And... Skate 3 is considered one of the greatest skate simulators ever made.
[257:37.07]And I was so salty and I talked about how the controls sucked and the game was fucking awful and shit.
[257:43.41]Yeah.
[257:43.85]This is one of the worst streams I've ever done.
[257:45.67]Putting myself in a really stupid awkward position.
[257:47.81]Let's find it.
[257:48.39]Only because I wouldn't want Demon Days to... Let's find it.
[257:53.94]I'll- I'll own it.
[257:54.60]Don't press A, press F. No.
[257:59.71]And then... ...fucking things to do.
[258:03.71]Demon Days is a good album.
[258:04.73]Why can I just never have any responsibilities and just play skate and learn how to play it and do good?
[258:09.61]He beat me up, apparently.
[258:12.52]Okay.
[258:13.64]Well...
[258:17.66]Jesus.
[258:18.26]But, yeah.
[258:19.38]Make that shit?
[258:20.56]When do I... Am I, like, misremembering this?
[258:22.82]Don't I talk about how I hate this whole thing and this game is a terrible... Alright, you gotta stop doing that, man.
[258:36.67]Speed here.
[258:37.59]I don't?
[258:39.25]What?
[258:41.47]Damn it.
[258:46.48]Alright, last one.
[258:47.26]One more.
[258:47.58]How do you manual?
[258:49.38]You're a concern with this item.
[258:51.08]Nope.
[258:53.18]Oh, now I'm dead.
[258:54.51]What the fuck?
[258:55.53]Who did this?
[258:56.53]Channel trailer?
[258:57.75]I don't want to alarm anybody here, but I'm sorry.
[259:00.43]I may have taken a shit in your house.
[259:02.30]Being one of the top ten players in the world.
[259:05.58]That's right.
[259:06.14]This is Jerma's grandfather here.
[259:08.31]Not Jerma.
[259:08.99]He's not as good as me.
[259:10.25]He can't give you the tips.
[259:11.73]He can't give you the strategies that I can.
[259:14.15]So let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world.
[259:17.29]I've not seen this in a long time.
[259:19.16]Get the fuck out of here, buddy.

[262:11.31]Welcome to the channel.
[262:11.92]Let's go.
[262:12.30]What can you expect?
[262:13.56]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[262:14.87]Oh, hey, what is going on, everybody?
[262:16.29]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[262:18.07]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[262:22.17]Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[262:25.09]I don't know what a statue is that'll play this game.
[262:28.01]I don't play Call of Duty.
[262:29.31]I just, like, wanted people to think I did.
[262:30.43]What was that?
[262:30.81]You were gonna bang?
[262:31.37]What?
[262:31.67]What were you gonna do?
[262:32.58]You were gonna bang me?
[262:33.38]Is that what you said?
[262:34.84]Oh, there we go.
[262:35.82]Oh!
[262:37.78]That's incredible orb, by the way.
[262:40.26]I'm getting this trip down memory.
[262:42.58]That's incredible orb.
[262:43.90]Incredible orb was such a fucking awesome dude.
[262:46.04]I remember, you want to know something funny?
[262:47.50]Here, listen to this.
[262:48.08]He still streams, too.
[262:48.66]I gotta fucking, like, raid him.
[262:49.77]He's from Sweden.
[263:02.88]So we just never stream at the same time.
[263:04.02]So here's the thing about Incredible Orb.
[263:06.50]Here's some tips.
[263:08.08]Not tip, but here's some insight for you.
[263:09.86]Incredible Orb is the only person.
[263:13.23]One of two people that I have met through YouTube and content creation that's ever met my parents.
[263:21.29]Yeah.
[263:22.94]Nice machinima shirt.
[263:23.82]Yeah.
[263:26.95]I literally have nothing but, like, swell things to say about Incredible Lord.
[263:31.16]I just, like, was just a class act.
[263:33.64]And I'm sure still is.
[263:43.60]Take it home.
[263:45.09]Remember, this is cute.
[263:48.73]Oh, man.
[263:54.74]He just ran a bunch of marathons.
[263:56.14]Yeah.
[263:57.26]See, he kept doing the healthy shit.
[264:00.28]I remember us having conversations about lifting and being healthy and working out.
[264:04.85]And I turned into an insect person.
[264:07.69]I turned into a bug.
[264:10.25]I turned into a big fat beetle person.
[264:15.47]And he's out here running marathons.
[264:18.54]Oh, good.
[264:19.28]That's good.
[264:21.55]The sway!
[264:22.35]The sway!
[264:22.63]I put a, in my channel trailer for YouTube 10 years ago, strafing.
[264:52.81]That's just strafing.
[264:55.31]In case you didn't know.
[264:57.69]Well, you non-gamers that don't know that pressing A and D makes you step left and right without needing to move your mouse.
[265:08.12]That was so important that I make sure everybody knows that I thought I was such a brilliant, smart motherfucker.
[265:15.81]I thought I was so goddamn gifted.
[265:19.21]That was in the four minutes of real estate.
[265:22.81]Of small amount of real estate that I had.
[265:26.65]To show you.
[265:27.19]To make sure you knew I was a gamer.
[265:29.01]And it worked.
[265:30.49]I was good.
[265:33.55]Also.
[265:34.73]Put Smite in the channel trailer.
[265:35.91]Because I thought I was going to play it every day.
[265:37.25]And it was going to be my new game.
[265:38.17]Otto.
[265:41.58]What else is he... I think there's Burger Boy in this.
[265:44.40]Yeah, he misses the table.
[265:45.45]Grandpa!
[265:45.69]There he is.
[265:46.69]Turn it up.
[265:47.57]Turn it up.
[266:13.09]Yeah, Burger Boy's in this video.
[266:13.99]Alright, let's go.
[266:14.55]I forgot about this.
[266:15.41]Okay, so Burger Boy... There's a video on my channel of Burger Boy in a Twinkie eating contest.
[266:18.15]And he... There was a little...
[266:39.97]Okay, this is some context.
[266:41.95]So, Burger Boy and Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy, two different people, by the way, they did a Twinkie contest for 15,000 subs on the channel, and Burger Boy won.
[266:51.95]It's a disgusting video, and I don't even know why it's still uploaded.
[266:55.46]So, after the video's over, Burger Boy's the champion.
[266:59.96]And there's like maybe like four or five Twinkies that are left that he didn't eat.
[267:04.54]And he went to swing his hand down to smash them.
[267:07.23]And this is like a hard just like granite countertop.
[267:11.71]He misses the Twinkies and he smashes his fucking hand.
[267:15.91]Smashes it and like destroys it.
[267:17.61]Listen to this.
[267:19.72]That was a hard granite countertop.
[267:26.93]and I think after that he's like ow and the other person's like I'm sorry I missed it I didn't I'm sorry I missed it oh yeah I threw a cake in his face hi guys today we're gonna create a washer dryer on jerome's channel there
[267:52.74]A spoonerism?

[268:09.77]The Germs.
[268:10.85]That's not what we call them.
[268:12.75]You idiot.
[268:13.77]They're the Germamites.

[268:23.27]So take care, everybody.
[268:25.11]The Andes.
[268:26.14]No, you're not Andes.
[268:29.34]Oh, that was so much fun.
[268:38.41]The Drew crew.
[268:41.81]Alright.
[268:43.03]I'll see you guys later.
[268:44.79]That was the trip down memory lane through the ages.
[268:48.51]If you want to play with this, you can.
[268:52.36]It exists right now.
[268:53.60]If you'd like to mess around and just go find a random timestamps of random videos, it is available for anyone to use.
[269:00.80]We have somebody can please link the website.
[269:04.78]Everybody thank Lazy Luke.
[269:07.20]Lazy Luke is the one responsible for putting this together.
[269:11.42]Just like he did last time.
[269:14.46]Also did it this time.
[269:15.27]Updated it.
[269:16.11]Gave a few more control panel things.
[269:17.53]Lazy Luke obviously knocked it out of the park again.
[269:21.99]And there it is.
[269:22.43]Jerma.org slash random.
[269:26.83]Go ahead.
[269:27.63]See if you can find some more quality cringe content.
[269:35.22]We'll do the outro now.
[269:36.72]I'll hang up in another few minutes.
[269:43.24]Thanks to all the subs.
[269:43.95]Thanks, everybody.
[269:45.33]The next time I will be live will be... That's a good question.
[269:50.21]Oh, no.
[269:50.35]I think I broke my... Did I break the... Oh, shit.
[269:54.87]I broke the credits.
[269:57.15]Oops.
[269:59.01]The website is down.
[270:03.29]Well, you can't all go do it at once.
[270:07.53]If everybody goes and does it at the same time.
[270:10.62]Oh, that's why the credits don't work.
[270:14.08]Because the credits are linked to the same web server, I think.
[270:16.96]Oh, oops.
[270:18.50]Well, you guys broke it.
[270:23.14]Well, shit.
[270:23.52]Well, thanks for the subs, everybody.
[270:28.41]I'll see you guys probably in the middle of the week.
[270:30.03]Keep an eye on the sus.
[270:31.11]Maybe like midweek, Wednesday or Thursday, maybe.
[270:35.21]Alex and I still do need to play Resident Evil 6, which I just got to figure out when we're going to do that.
[270:40.34]We'll see.
[270:43.46]Let me get my stuff up here and... Yeah, I've been around for a while.
[270:49.38]I've been around for a long time.
[270:51.16]Sometimes I forget just how long it's been.
[270:54.28]When I watched videos of me when I was like 25.
[270:58.20]It's a weird feeling.
[270:59.32]It's kind of odd.
[271:03.78]But it's cool.
[271:06.31]I'm glad it still exists.
[271:07.26]That it's still there.
[271:08.26]100 subs?
[271:13.74]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[271:15.14]Oh, yeah.
[271:15.50]Let's go.

[271:16.20]Let's go.
[271:16.48]You're right.
[271:17.02]I forgot completely.
[271:17.98]Let me do that right now.

[272:19.31]Bing?
[272:22.21]What do you mean, Bing?
[272:35.97]What a great investment.
[272:44.71]Raid?
[272:44.99]Yeah, we'll do a raid.
[272:46.77]Is it Vinny streaming?
[272:47.51]Let's go say hi to Vinny.
[272:49.97]Oh, by the way, I need to make the- No more raid song bullshit.
[272:53.88]That's probably annoying the fuck out of everybody.
[272:56.38]No more raid song shit, please.
[273:00.20]No more raid song.
[273:01.52]Stop doing that.
[273:03.42]Every time I raid you guys, not raid you guys, but every time I raid with you guys, I look over at the chat and I can feel the eyes glaring over from the other streamer.
[273:13.05]Glaring over at it and being like, they're fucking saying raid song and I'm not gonna do it.
[273:18.33]No more raid song.
[273:19.57]No more.
[273:20.27]No more.
[273:22.29]Or you're grounded.
[273:23.55]You're grounded.
[273:25.55]You're grounded.
[273:27.78]In fact, you're grounded anyways.
[273:29.54]Because I know that some of you are going to do it.
[273:31.54]You're grounded anyways.
[273:34.22]You're preemptively grounded.
[273:37.73]But yeah, please go say hello to Vinny.
[273:39.27]What are they doing?
[273:41.21]True Crime New York.
[273:43.13]I think we actually saw a clip from this game.
[273:46.99]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[273:51.14]Keep an eye on the sus.
[273:51.92]Thanks for watching.
