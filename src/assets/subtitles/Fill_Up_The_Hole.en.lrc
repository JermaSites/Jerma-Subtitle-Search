[00:11.71]Hey, what's up?
[00:16.52]The music is kind of, I guess, a little eerie.
[00:21.63]Oh, no intro.
[00:22.59]New computer.
[00:23.75]This is a sad moment.
[00:27.36]Hey, when are you going to play Deadlock?
[00:28.46]I'm not going to play Deadlock.
[00:30.32]Okay.
[00:30.99]That's it.
[00:31.23]You're not going to ask me that the first thing I do when I start.
[00:44.16]How are you?
[00:45.98]Hello, everybody.
[00:46.78]How you doing?
[00:50.89]I'm doing pretty good.
[00:52.99]Hope you've been well.
[00:57.97]I'm back here for a little bit.
[01:00.82]We're going to be streaming for the next three straight days.
[01:06.38]What?
[01:08.37]I'm going to stream today.
[01:09.19]I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[01:11.69]I'm going to stream Saturday.
[01:18.52]Is it actually an Omega gaming weekend?
[01:20.86]Well, not necessarily.
[01:27.39]There will be streams on three days, but each one of these streams is probably only going to be like two to four hours long.
[01:35.04]We're going to go with it like a three to five hour mark for most of these streams.
[01:41.37]And it's probably going to be like that for the foreseeable future.
[01:47.78]New PC, that's right.
[01:48.88]I'll talk about it on... Hey, I'll talk about it on Saturday.
[01:51.40]I'm fucking excited.
[01:59.05]Yeah, we're going to play with the horsemen today for a few hours.
[02:02.09]We got a couple games.
[02:03.82]I know they're all playing Deadlock right now.
[02:07.64]I started my... We're supposed to start at 2.
[02:10.52]I wanted to just be live because we got to catch them so they don't join another game.
[02:16.61]You know what I'm saying?
[02:21.65]No more 3090.
[02:22.47]No, no more 3090.
[02:24.09]That's right.
[02:30.50]And actually, okay.
[02:31.60]So I, this is for Saturday, but I'll give you a little bit of a preview.
[02:38.27]Uh, Saturday is going to be, there's going to be a sponsor on Saturday.
[02:40.93]It's only going to be for an hour, but it's the computer and something else.
[02:49.11]What do you tell me what fucking sponsor I got on Saturday?
[02:55.09]I finally made it!
[03:00.18]Uh... I got a Predator Orion 7000.
[03:03.40]It's a beast.
[03:08.59]And... Game Pass.
[03:11.38]I'm gonna be sponsored by Game Pass.
[03:13.80]How fucked up is that?
[03:20.33]I've only been talking about it, positively, for three and a half years.
[03:26.85]Yeah, so we'll do that on Saturday.
[03:38.83]I love people.
[03:39.51]It's like I got married or I had a baby.
[03:42.04]People are like, ooh, congratulations, man.
[03:44.86]Oh my God, what?
[03:46.35]No.
[03:46.75]Did you really?
[03:48.41]Congratulations.
[03:57.53]But that's Saturday.
[03:58.31]We're not doing that right now.
[04:00.83]We'll do that on Saturday.
[04:03.06]But the music you're hearing right now... Let's just go.
[04:04.88]Here's a plan.
[04:05.36]Ready?
[04:06.46]We're going to play Fill Up the Hole until the horsemen are ready.
[04:10.85]Then we're going to play Odd Remedy.
[04:14.69]And maybe that Drive Horizons game?
[04:19.82]It's called Fill Up... That's the name of the game.
[04:21.08]It's called Fill Up the Hole.
[04:25.59]I'm going to miss the stream on Saturday, but I hope it sucks.
[04:30.48]Oh, no, that's not... Wait, is that... No, wait, wait, wait.
[04:32.72]Hope it... What?
[04:34.66]Is this a word?
[04:35.63]Hope it... Off?
[04:37.37]What is that?
[04:41.81]Alright, so that's what we're doing today.
[04:43.47]We're waiting for the Deadlock Boys to be ready.
[04:46.48]Well, it's two o'clock is what we all agreed on.
[04:50.16]And then tomorrow, I got a banger for you tomorrow.
[04:53.76]We're going to play Restaurant Empire tomorrow.
[04:57.70]It is a top-down simulation game.
[05:01.65]It's an old one.
[05:03.87]And it looks crazy.
[05:09.72]I'm very excited about that tomorrow.
[05:13.86]And then Saturday, we're going to do some Predator Orion stuff.
[05:19.11]As well as some Game Pass stuff.
[05:20.49]And then we'll play something else for a few hours after.
[05:24.12]But that's kind of cool.
[05:25.42]That's happening.
[05:26.32]Been in the works for a while.
[05:28.72]You got an RTX?
[05:29.90]I got a 5080.
[05:30.61]There's a 5080 in here now.
[05:33.19]I'm a 5080 gamer.
[05:38.70]Is it going to be like Pasta Italiano all over again?
[05:41.02]The game looks absolutely insane.
[05:43.37]Okay, here's something I will tell you.
[05:48.63]Let me go to the game because this is just like a weird screen to have on right now.
[05:57.49]How come you can't see it?
[06:00.72]Oh, that's, that's why.
[06:03.72]Uh, okay.
[06:04.56]So, the computer I had before, dude, every time I would turn on a game or my stream, it would sound like a jet engine in here.
[06:16.74]That 3090 was just at 100%.
[06:22.55]I tried to fix it.
[06:23.57]I tried to do everything I could.
[06:24.77]Should I do relax mode?
[06:29.20]My room would heat up to like 85 degrees.
[06:32.11]That thing was a space heater.
[06:38.93]I was gonna play this for like 20 minutes.
[06:41.26]Alright, there's a hole that gives money when trash is thrown into it.
[06:44.64]Press the info button under the portal to create a peon who can help you.
[06:47.88]Okay.
[06:52.95]Oh shit, that was one out of four.
[06:57.81]Oh, okay.
[06:58.13]Get a new peon.
[07:00.13]and I got dude this is I'm in a spaceship right now I have a new setup I'm gonna like show it to you on Saturday but like I feel like a streamer now I feel like a real streamer this keyboard is awesome I got like multiple monitors here I've got a I've got a predator orion 7000 I feel like a real streamer it's like that's weird to me I need to get used to this
[07:27.10]He's got gamer mode engaged.
[07:28.94]I knew it was going to take me a while to get used to.
[07:34.01]Okay, right click and drag to move the camera.
[07:36.25]Oh, okay.
[07:39.80]So they pick up trash and they throw it in the hole.
[07:41.94]Okay.
[07:44.32]More trash will be needed.
[07:45.40]Press the build button to construct a new building.
[07:52.21]Dude, I love these games.
[07:54.58]Oh, you just throw it down here.
[07:57.07]He needs help.
[08:00.47]You made the blueprint for streaming.
[08:02.04]I feel like a real streamer.
[08:05.18]I didn't make the blueprint for streaming.
[08:08.91]I downloaded OBS and stumbled my way through settings.
[08:12.71]And followed the advice of other people that were doing it too.
[08:18.12]I love incremental games.
[08:19.04]This is so fun.
[08:21.26]Okay, so let's get some... What do I need?

[08:56.05]I don't even know what that is.
[08:57.89]I know it's a Hollow Knight adjacent kind of game or something, right?
[09:04.12]I don't even know what it is.
[09:05.14]It's like a Hollow Knight sequel.
[09:07.86]I swear to God, I don't know what it is.
[09:11.83]I know that everyone loves it and everyone's important.
[09:14.35]People have been waiting for it and they just kind of announced it.
[09:18.74]It's Hollow Knight 2.
[09:21.97]bake game pass fan don't you dare say that to me you have any idea don't you I am the ultimate game pass fan okay alright I got 38 bucks let's build a factory some buildings require workers press the plus button oh that we get workers now okay cool uh what does this do okay produce trash oh so this makes trash
[09:52.12]+2 rage bait.
[09:56.87]Somebody said, what the fuck is this shit?
[09:59.24]Is this the first time you've ever been here?
[10:00.72]I love these kind of games.
[10:02.58]And I'm just killing time before the horsemen show up.
[10:08.68]Said every Christian ever.
[10:29.47]they don't say that your mic is fucked up what the four horsemen is gonna how many horsemen do we have four maybe five six we're gonna have like eight horsemen eventually
[11:00.10]We're going to end up having like 15 horsemen.
[11:05.63]We got so many friends of the horsemen.
[11:08.61]You got five, but three.
[11:27.92]We're good with four for now.
[11:35.47]Criken Squeaks.
[11:39.99]Okay.
[11:40.31]I love how you got Criken Squeaks, Northernlion, and then Queso.
[11:45.72]Oh, the team is expanding.
[11:53.91]We're good with what we got right now.
[11:55.95]That's fucking hilarious, though.
[12:00.13]Alright, I need more workers here.
[12:06.33]How come there's only one person?
[12:07.29]Oh, they're all here.
[12:08.45]They're all producing trash.
[12:13.28]Okay, there's a rock in the way.
[12:14.36]Remove the rock to make more space.
[12:15.98]Oh, shit.
[12:16.40]Okay.
[12:18.76]This is... PM will drop trash in the storage.
[12:20.78]Workers will throw the trash into the hole.
[12:22.23]Okay.
[12:26.07]So they drop it here and they throw it back this way.
[12:28.55]Can you have multiple of the same building?
[12:33.55]I have tons of trash right now.
[12:34.52]I need more workers.
[12:37.75]I got six okay level one maybe I should just make a bunch of these you should vote somebody out every time you get a new horseman no we're not doing that the 15 horsemen of the apocalypse
[13:08.16]Uh, I think I'm making too much.
[13:14.37]What are you doing?
[13:15.91]What is that?
[13:22.78]I have to clear all these rocks.
[13:23.92]Maybe I should get you off of this.
[13:29.17]You said that like Cathy Mitchell.
[13:39.30]Oh, actually, he's just filling up.
[13:40.56]That's cool.
[13:46.88]How come you don't stream as much as Ster?
[13:49.12]I heard Ster has been playing Deadlock every day for like 10 hours a day.
[13:53.37]I heard he's just going crazy on it.
[14:01.68]Alright, 82 bucks.
[14:02.18]I gotta clear this.
[14:02.76]How do I get this out of the way?
[14:06.72]Oh, okay.
[14:07.26]A worker has to get rid of it.
[14:10.62]Can I only have one worker do this?
[14:22.66]Maybe I should... Wait.
[14:23.90]Allow or prevent outside peon from dropping trash into the catapult.
[14:27.06]Maybe I should allow it.
[14:32.33]Should I allow that?
[14:34.52]Alright, I'm going to go with...
[14:37.77]That's maxed out.
[14:39.07]What if I bring this to level 2?
[14:40.87]Oh, here we go.
[14:44.47]There we go.
[14:44.81]Nice.
[14:45.35]Okay.
[14:45.57]Now I got 9 peons.
[14:52.38]Is Deadlock still in Alpha?
[14:56.08]Or did they put it in Beta yet?
[15:05.57]It's very early access.
[15:07.35]I feel like
[15:08.16]I probably would care about it when it got closer.
[15:17.02]Okay, can I build here?
[15:18.58]Get that last rock!
[15:22.73]Somebody said it's never coming out.
[15:24.95]It's definitely gonna come out.
[15:26.67]What?
[15:36.90]What's wrong?
[15:37.54]What's wrong?
[15:39.22]What's an earthquake?
[15:40.16]When the hole is full, an earthquake will empty it.
[15:42.89]Destroy all buildings and remove money.
[15:44.83]What?
[15:45.05]75 plus 75.
[15:46.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:48.56]I don't want to do an earthquake.
[15:59.40]So is this like prestiging?
[16:02.24]I think I have to do this.
[16:09.50]Oh shit.
[16:10.26]Okay.
[16:11.20]So we just keep going.
[16:15.33]Alright, cool.
[16:15.69]Let's build a house.
[16:19.71]Let's build a catapult and a factory.
[16:24.78]I get it.
[16:25.32]So you just keep doing it.
[16:28.70]Do level two house.
[16:32.06]This is cool.
[16:36.87]So now I have a 1200 capacity.
[16:44.21]Running out of trash.
[16:45.11]We need to make more trash, right?
[16:52.52]Alright, now I got 9 out of 9.
[16:53.57]63 to do this again.
[16:57.79]I feel like I want more workers.
[17:03.96]We're T-4 minutes away.
[17:06.79]From the horseman showing up.
[17:12.27]Oh, this makes more money.
[17:33.88]Hey, those four minutes can't go fast enough.
[17:35.80]Time that person up.
[17:43.79]Alright, now I can have 12 workers.
[17:45.15]29.
[17:51.46]How much do I have?
[17:52.08]26?
[17:58.26]Top right.
[18:01.45]Oh!
[18:02.17]Unlock upgrade tree.
[18:04.10]I'm so glad I saw that person.
[18:06.96]Dude, you got a 50-80.
[18:07.86]You're playing Fill Up the Hole.
[18:09.26]I'm just killing time until we play the game we were going to play today.
[18:15.85]That is kind of funny that this is the first game that I do play, though.
[18:18.09]You're right.
[18:22.31]Okay, so what do I want to do?
[18:28.66]How does this allow peons to rest, get happy, and produce trash?
[18:33.73]I kind of want that.
[18:36.82]Oh, I need two shards.
[18:39.00]I only have one.
[18:42.81]Cool.
[18:42.93]Alright.
[18:48.11]This is making the trash.
[18:50.64]There's already too much.
[18:51.44]I need more workers.
[18:59.31]Alright, come on.
[19:01.12]Why can't you pick that up?
[19:03.06]It's a blue shard.
[19:16.77]Hey, can you ask Holly if she could style your hair Victorian style and you come into the stream with your iconic Victorian era hair?
[19:25.10]I'll do something weird before I cut it because I'm going to cut it soon.
[19:31.97]And I'm cutting it all off.
[19:33.93]Sorry to say.
[19:45.38]Alright, clear that up.
[19:48.28]You going bald?
[19:49.00]No, I'm going... I'm going 2018, Jeremy.
[19:59.11]2018, 2019...
[20:02.44]Going to be a little bit shorter.
[20:03.39]Return of the mustache here.
[20:10.01]Something like that.
[20:30.67]Don't do that.
[20:31.26]It'd be like babysitting their dad without their facial hair.
[20:39.71]Are you implying that you guys are going to cry?
[20:41.27]Am I going to pull up and show that and you guys are just going to start crying?
[20:52.88]I can't have more than one person here.
[20:54.21]Wow, that was loud.
[21:00.00]Two trash per worker.
[21:02.23]Level two.
[21:04.45]I guess it just increases the storage.
[21:11.78]Born too early to explore the stars.
[21:13.24]Born too late to see Michelangelo.
[21:15.86]Born just in time to see you.
[21:21.03]That does not sound like a great thing.
[21:24.23]Okay, that doesn't sound like...
[21:31.10]I feel like there's better people to put there.
[21:41.03]Born too early to see Galileo.
[21:43.91]Born too late to see the future.
[21:47.74]Born just in time to see this dickhead play this game.
[21:59.51]Are we getting an earthquake?
[22:09.83]I want to see the future, though.
[22:11.10]That's too bad.
[22:11.62]You got me.
[22:18.37]You got me.
[22:22.60]You got me.
[22:26.47]You got me.
[22:36.43]Dude, space travel will be so interesting.
[22:38.49]Once we can travel the stars... You got me.
[22:52.81]King Henry smelled?
[22:55.35]I don't know anything about anything.
[22:59.67]That was the first thing I could think of.
[23:09.01]You're depressing to watch?
[23:10.35]What?
[23:10.61]No, I'm not.
[23:17.72]This is getting kind of full.
[23:25.51]Which is kind of like a public hanging.
[23:30.30]Get him!
[23:31.50]Get him!
[23:33.62]Get him up there!
[23:37.46]He put two points in strength!
[23:40.85]I wanted him to put those in agility!
[23:43.45]Get him up there!
[23:45.59]Yeah, I can see it.
[23:54.14]Ooh, house or factory?
[23:58.39]House.
[24:02.57]Whoa, what happened?
[24:03.89]Whoa, whoa, what happened to my house?
[24:05.60]What did I do?
[24:07.11]What happened?
[24:07.69]It destroyed itself?
[24:09.54]Wait, why did that happen?
[24:13.82]Did I click destroy?
[24:15.25]Oh, it has a durability.
[24:16.47]Shit.
[24:16.81]Okay.
[24:21.62]Oh my god, it does have a durability.
[24:23.06]This game's addicting.
[24:33.39]Come on, I need that.
[24:39.80]More people can be in the house.
[24:42.10]Wait, they... That's cute.
[24:45.21]Oh, they drop the stuff, though.
[24:58.25]Can I do anything with these?
[24:59.90]Whoa.
[25:02.14]That sounded like a fake.
[25:03.14]I'm sorry.
[25:09.26]Hey, did you play Deltarune?
[25:10.42]I haven't played it.
[25:11.23]I haven't even opened it.
[25:12.11]I'm sorry.
[25:12.57]I haven't.
[25:14.49]I don't even know what the main menu screen looks like.
[25:16.61]I haven't played it.
[25:21.88]Hey!
[25:31.11]You played the first two chapters?
[25:33.47]That's true.
[25:35.19]It was a long time ago, though.
[25:43.01]alright I think we'll get one more earthquake before we start playing the other game alright factory is up earthquake coming up do I even build the house because it's all going to get destroyed anyways in a minute
[26:14.17]It's 2-0-5.
[26:15.65]Did they start another deadlock match?
[26:17.89]Are they deadlocking right now?
[26:26.04]That scares the shit out of me every time.
[26:31.09]Is Vinny going to be playing with you?
[26:32.05]I want to watch him instead.
[26:33.87]Yeah, go watch him.
[26:34.81]He'll be live.
[26:50.35]He's live right now.
[26:51.27]Well, that person's not a real Vinny fan then.
[26:53.91]They would have already known that.
[26:56.76]You would have already known that he was live.
[27:10.28]Alright, I'm just going to get workers.
[27:18.05]Why is your taste in games so different than your fans?
[27:20.90]I don't know if that's accurate.
[27:26.57]I don't think I even have taste.
[27:30.64]I'll eat anything.
[27:33.08]I'll eat anything once.
[27:41.47]This one's pretty scrumptious.
[27:47.05]Alright, earthquake coming up.

[27:54.62]Yeah, I've eaten goat cheese once.
[27:55.82]Or twice or three times and I'm like, I don't like it.
[28:00.04]I think, uh, are we ready to do this?
[28:03.09]I can save the game, right?
[28:09.13]I'm going all in on the houses.
[28:14.18]That's an L take.
[28:15.16]I think goat cheese is one of the most disgusting substances on Earth.
[28:22.25]Oh, here we go.
[28:22.65]Earthquake.
[28:27.70]Alright, before we do the earthquake, I'm going to call Vinny.
[28:31.94]I'm going to talk shit about the other two.

[29:44.80]uh I'm looking right now I don't see him you don't see him oh he said he was going right now okay alright cool well you're always welcome at my stream where I think Ben Franklin is in hell I don't know why he would be but it's something to do with lightning you know what if Ben Franklin didn't invent the lightning key we wouldn't be online right now dude Ben Franklin invented way more that's the everybody says that
[30:13.77]Ben Franklin invented so much shit.
[30:18.18]It's crazy, Ben.
[30:19.04]He invented glasses.
[30:22.19]The bifocal was invented by Ben Franklin.
[30:25.43]I didn't know that.
[30:26.34]I didn't know that.
[30:27.56]He... Swimmies.
[30:28.88]You know, swimmies that you jump in the pool with and you float and you have swimmies on?
[30:32.11]Ben Franklin invented those.
[30:34.19]That's cool.
[30:35.59]I heard he invented deadlock.
[30:40.94]How have you been the past couple of weeks, Jerm?
[30:43.95]I've been pretty good.
[30:44.75]I'm just kind of existing, getting some stuff done.
[30:48.15]I have a new computer, a whole new setup too.
[30:51.17]What made you go for a new setup?
[30:54.06]Well, my old computer was a piece of shit.
[30:56.64]It kept having problems.
[30:58.56]And then I got sponsored with a new computer.
[31:03.59]Damn.
[31:04.13]Good for you, man.
[31:06.63]Is it good?
[31:07.52]it's yeah I mean I'm using it right now screaming on it right now it seems pretty great cool well good luck enjoy you know Jerma you you know you mentioned that game I played where the kid went into the the jet engine yeah so I play I don't know if you you caught it but you can use your new computer to play it if you need to and uh it's called how I became a freak how I became a freak yeah it's really good
[31:38.72]When you did that, that was for people that don't know.
[31:41.85]Can you explain a little bit what that was?
[31:43.17]Because it seriously is one of the coolest little inventions I've ever seen.
[31:46.27]Rivals Ben Franklin's inventions, but... Clearly.
[31:49.64]Yeah.
[31:50.18]And it's also, you know, if you don't get a chance to experience it, I could always send you a file if you're interested.
[31:54.72]It's like an hour long, another episode.
[31:57.29]It's even better than the one you saw.
[31:58.83]Really?
[31:59.11]But it's called Choose Your Own Nightmare.
[32:01.87]And it's basically like a choose your own adventure, interactive story from the late 90s.
[32:06.68]And it's like...
[32:07.85]You know, uh-oh, this weird kid came to stay with me and my parents and he's got superpowers and he's weird and he's evil.
[32:16.00]Uh-oh, he's going to start a cult.
[32:17.60]Do I join him?
[32:18.33]I did see that one.
[32:19.31]I did see that one.
[32:20.89]Yeah, so that's the one that you saw, but How I Became a Freak is about someone who looks in a magic carnival mirror and becomes a freak.
[32:30.19]And there's a freak tent, there's aliens, there's bugs, and there's rot, and there's clowns.
[32:37.90]And it's superb.
[32:39.98]This is really good.
[32:41.67]Yeah.
[32:43.53]That's what I've been up to.
[32:46.21]Yeah, yeah.
[32:47.33]Always sunny episode.
[32:50.24]I love shit like that.
[32:51.88]I saw you doing some of the Flash stuff, too.
[32:57.89]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[32:58.39]I like Flash stuff.
[33:00.11]love that stuff I am so happy because I recently kind of got into this pick of um trying to get a bunch of retro stuff like old old stuff dude I got a couple of cool things I got a in the box like original not sealed or anything um the Mario brothers atari game the actual physical atari game really yeah I've been on like a retro collection pick recently Mario atari game
[33:31.13]Was it a lot?
[33:31.95]Or was it just kind of like... No, it was like... It was like it was up there.
[33:37.04]It wasn't like thousands of dollars, but it was like, you know, it was like a hundred.
[33:40.32]Something.
[33:41.53]No, but if it's a collector's item that you like, I mean, why not?
[33:44.47]And it seems like it's kind of rare.
[33:46.13]Dude, this thing is fucking cool.
[33:49.84]It's not a hundred thousand.
[33:50.86]It's like a hundred.
[33:52.23]I spent like a hundred bucks on it.
[33:56.42]That's cool.
[33:57.02]But it's like the full box.
[33:58.33]It's a box.
[33:58.87]It's a manual.
[33:59.43]It's everything.
[34:00.13]It's a beautiful cartridge in there.
[34:02.07]I'm super into it.
[34:04.31]Yeah, that's... When I go to RetroCon, I've been to like a couple retro gaming conventions.
[34:09.48]They have a lot of that stuff there.
[34:11.09]It's usually, you know, like the prices are a little bit inflated, but I feel like they've evened out a bit.
[34:16.47]So that's cool though.
[34:18.80]I'm not going to go too crazy with it because obviously I don't want to... Because you can get really wild with that stuff.
[34:25.62]I got a bunch of cool little you know they were like five bucks each like I got a bunch of these little like pac-man the original pac-man atar and they were loose too and they're kind of all beat up I got this awesome one I got pigs in space the atari game yeah it's so this thing is beat the fuck up dude it looks like somebody put it through the washing machine but I I'm I'm on like an atari collection kick and those are like five bucks like 10 bucks for each each one of them
[34:52.57]Yeah.
[34:53.11]And it's like, if it's beat up, it has more character.
[34:55.47]Yeah.
[34:55.71]It's like, I agree.
[34:56.37]It's like a guitar.
[34:57.79]You know, I got like really, um, when my guitars get like little bumps or like cracks in them, I'm like, damn it.
[35:04.42]And then people always tell me it's character.
[35:06.80]So now I just beat them up on purpose.
[35:11.50]Make them, uh, this one in particular that I got on that same topic.
[35:16.19]It's, I think the game is called Zaxxon for the Atari.
[35:20.45]Oh yeah.
[35:21.11]Yeah.
[35:21.23]It's a, yeah.
[35:22.57]yeah this is it's the box right it's the full box um this thing is literally it came out it had to have come out of grandma's attic it is dirty it's like cigarette colored it's crushed the box is awful isn't it if I were to get this graded the person grading it would think I was playing a prank on them they'd be like why the they'd be like why'd you bring this here um it is so up that I would be playing a prank on somebody uh that would be doing it so
[35:50.38]But I'll show it on stream one day here.
[35:54.20]Yeah.
[35:54.78]I've been on a big kick of it.
[35:57.11]Cool.
[35:58.23]Yeah, it's a fun-ish hobby.
[36:00.37]I have a couple things.
[36:01.45]You know what?
[36:01.79]People give me cool stuff at cons.
[36:03.77]Once in a while, I got a Blade Runner laser disk.
[36:07.34]I got the Blade Runner game because people just know I like that stuff.
[36:12.82]Cool.
[36:13.52]Yeah, just any weird old game that I've played on stream, people tend to bring to me.
[36:18.11]Or I...
[36:19.72]Uh, terrible games that I've played, which I don't want.
[36:22.19]I give them back.
[36:23.43]Like Devil May Cry 2.
[36:24.47]I don't want that.
[36:26.71]Why not?
[36:27.27]You don't want Devil May Cry?
[36:29.21]Uh, not two.
[36:30.47]One is good.
[36:31.20]Three is good.
[36:32.14]Five is good.
[36:33.08]Don't want one.
[36:33.98]Or two, rather.
[36:34.68]What's the one that I played that exploded everybody's ears and was horrible?
[36:38.10]The three?
[36:42.03]My chat's saying three.
[36:43.29]Yeah.
[36:45.81]That was fucked up.
[36:47.37]I can't believe that.
[36:48.41]Yeah, I caught it.
[36:49.33]That's a good clip.
[36:50.23]I like that clip.
[36:52.89]Are they still playing Deadlock?
[36:54.70]Are we just going to sit here while they play Deadlock?
[36:57.22]Okay, you know what?
[36:59.38]It's like eating the whole cake.
[37:00.95]It's like, have a piece of cake.
[37:03.35]Yeah.
[37:05.51]Yeah, they've submitted to the throes of addiction.
[37:09.36]Alright.
[37:10.48]Well, I'll tell you what.
[37:11.22]I'm going to start a server.
[37:13.43]Oh, wait.
[37:14.71]Bug Remedy?
[37:15.27]Whatever it's called?
[37:16.51]Yeah, give it a shot.
[37:17.60]Let's see what we can do.
[37:18.50]Maybe we'll get in there and we'll learn the game so we can explain it to them.
[37:22.40]You know what I'm saying?
[37:23.69]Let me make sure this saves because this game is fun.
