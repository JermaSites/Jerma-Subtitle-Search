[00:55.60]Hi.
[00:57.96]Welcome to the show.
[01:03.06]It's me, Jeremy.
[01:05.80]Ooh.
[01:08.50]Hi, guys.
[01:11.52]It's me.
[01:12.84]I just said that.
[01:15.18]Otto, what are you doing?
[01:15.78]Stop.
[01:18.12]We're going to play Metro tonight.
[01:20.48]Welcome to another stream.
[01:23.68]Otto.
[01:24.72]Otto.
[01:26.04]Otto, get down.
[01:28.04]Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[01:31.26]Hey, get down.
[01:34.49]Why are you, what are you doing?
[01:35.75]Leave it alone.
[01:37.93]We're going to play Metro tonight, Metro 2033.
[01:41.17]If you are curious.
[01:45.23]Explain the late.
[01:48.21]I'm always fucking late.
[01:49.87]I was watering my plants outside.
[01:53.86]What is fucking, what the hell is he doing?
[01:57.15]So anyways, I've never played Metro 2033, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
[02:05.37]How do we know this isn't pre-recorded?
[02:08.71]Because I'm right here.
[02:10.26]It's like Santa is going to sit on auto.
[02:13.00]No, he's not.
[02:14.88]You waited 22 hours for me?
[02:16.78]Why are you waiting that long for me?
[02:19.00]You know my stream schedule.
[02:21.22]It's 7-ish p.m.
[02:23.26]Eastern Standard Daylight Time.
[02:27.29]Hi, baby.
[02:28.20]Dab on stream.
[02:28.94]No, that's not going to happen.
[02:32.78]Why would it be late?
[02:39.36]Hey, hey.
[02:40.95]All right.
[02:42.75]Stop it.
[02:45.37]Will you stop this?
[02:47.33]Get over here.
[02:48.37]Come on.
[02:48.67]Come over here right now.
[02:49.81]Over here.
[02:51.37]Come over here.
[02:55.19]Alright, wait a minute.
[02:57.67]You come right over here right now.
[02:59.09]Sit in your bed.
[02:59.71]There's a bed right here for him.
[03:02.59]He's like, he's like up this thing's ass.
[03:06.39]Alright, well, I'll be right back.
[03:07.91]I'm going to grab a drink.
[03:09.09]We'll get started.
[03:10.23]I'll see you guys in like two fucking seconds.
[03:12.34]Give me one second.
[03:29.12]Come on.
[03:29.54]Get out.
[03:30.04]Come on.
[03:31.46]Go that way.
[03:32.84]Just go stand over there.
[03:34.42]No, no, no.
[03:36.03]Out.
[03:36.63]Out of the room.
[03:37.65]Get out of the room right now.
[03:40.01]Get... No, I don't... I know we shared a trash grilled cheese last night, but I don't have any more.
[03:47.39]No, I... What?
[03:53.21]Will you fuck off?
[03:55.49]I don't get...
[03:57.69]Leave... Like, leave him alone.
[03:59.81]Why?
[03:59.89]I don't even, like, have... I have no explanation as to why the fuck he's doing this right now.
[04:15.60]Yeah.
[04:18.98]You know, he's kind of freaking me out, so...
[04:22.69]Anyways, we're going to play Metro.
[04:24.05]Let me just move this down.
[04:26.55]I've said it like fucking 30 times already, but it's okay.
[04:32.41]Metro!
[04:33.37]Here it is.
[04:34.53]Hopefully you can see it on the screen.
[04:37.95]Play on Ranger mode.
[04:38.89]I don't know what that is.
[04:43.22]I have absolutely no idea what that means.
[04:44.44]We're just going to do new... Whoa!
[04:46.02]Bright screen!
[04:48.98]Survival or Spartan?
[04:52.40]Am I excited for the Boba Fett movie in 2019?
[04:55.08]Oh, shit!
[04:57.20]I saw Star Wars.
[04:58.49]I saw Star Wars The Last Jedi.
[05:01.67]I didn't like it.
[05:02.27]All right, so choose your play style.
[05:04.91]We're going to do with ammo and... Spartan or survival?
[05:07.61]Which one?
[05:09.49]Which one should I do?
[05:13.88]No spoilers?
[05:16.32]Without spoilers, I'm going to...
[05:19.64]Without spoilers, I'm going to give you guys my review of Star Wars The Last Jedi.
[05:28.20]It's alright.
[05:29.28]It was a solid movie.
[05:31.58]If you want me to place it somewhere, I'll put it in like... Alright, here's like The Empire Strikes Back.
[05:38.21]Everybody knows that.
[05:39.39]Here's like Return of the Jedi.
[05:40.91]They're kind of neck and neck a little bit.
[05:42.15]Maybe like here and here.
[05:44.53]Last Jedi's here.
[05:47.36]Not even on the fucking screen is where it is.
[05:51.81]Anyways, what should I be playing?
[05:55.59]Survival is OG?
[05:56.45]Alright, I'll do survival.
[05:59.99]With ammo... I'm just going to do the original mode.
[06:05.12]Deadlier combat, more challenging stealth.
[06:07.32]I don't know about this one.
[06:08.48]I don't know if I like this idea.
[06:13.10]Resource management?
[06:16.28]What about Spartan?
[06:17.74]Enjoy the more forgiving combat and stealth experience of Mestro Last Light.
[06:25.75]We'll do the way the game is supposed to be played.
[06:29.25]Survival is the real one.
[06:30.15]Let's do it.
[06:31.17]We're going to do normal.
[06:31.88]We're not going to do any bullshit.
[06:33.20]Every encounter presents a series of challenges.
[06:38.08]Alright.
[06:42.22]I've got to get him out of this room.
[06:43.28]He's freaking me out.
[06:44.82]Will you stop this?
[06:46.68]Come with me.
[06:47.16]Come on.
[06:48.04]Up here.
[06:48.97]Come on.
[06:51.17]I know it's weird.
[06:52.11]I know.
[06:52.79]You've got to get out of here.
[06:55.13]Come with me.
[06:55.49]Come on.
[06:56.31]Come on.
[06:56.97]Let's go.
[06:59.31]You know where to go.
[06:59.89]Go on.
[07:01.19]Oh, is the door closed?
[07:01.89]I'll get you.
[07:02.29]Hold on.
[07:04.66]Come on.
[07:06.68]Let's go, dog.
[07:10.74]Come on.
[07:11.28]Go, go, go, go, go.
[07:13.64]Go up there, dog.
[07:34.08]Oh my god, he moved!
[07:55.00]Can you fucking imagine?
[07:59.48]What if I walked in here?
[08:01.26]And he was like turned this way.
[08:03.79]That'd be so fucking funny.
[08:09.45]All right, anyways.
[08:12.07]Give me a second.
[08:13.60]Otto just had to get the fuck out of here.
[08:14.60]He's been a weirdo.
[08:17.32]All right, Ranger.
[08:18.00]No, we're just gonna do hardcore.
[08:19.82]Oh, thank you.
[08:22.58]Oh, yeah, you good?
[08:23.79]We good?
[08:24.83]We're good.
[08:25.31]Perfect.
[08:26.47]Hey, watch out for the Santa.
[08:27.57]He's going to fucking, like, he's going to start to move on you.
[08:29.49]Wouldn't that be fucking terrifying?
[08:32.95]Uh, well, it actually scared the shit out of me this morning when I, like, walked in.
[08:36.80]Oh, when you walked in?
[08:37.52]I wasn't even expecting it.
[08:38.94]Yeah, because I thought you were in the office.
[08:40.92]And it, like, scared the shit out of me.
[08:43.38]Fucking God.
[08:44.68]All right, see you soon.
[08:47.20]Fucking Santa.
[08:47.86]Do you want this in here?
[08:49.19]No, no, keep it closed.
[08:50.75]Keep it open.
[08:51.09]All right, let's go.
[08:54.57]Alright, let's go to... Go!
[09:00.73]Camera correction!
[09:02.09]I left the drink upstairs and I never brought it down.
[09:08.08]Let's go.
[09:08.54]I don't know what the fuck I'm thinking.
[09:12.64]I brought a coffee down here first.
[09:14.68]And I left this up here.
[09:15.54]Am I really doing coffee and booze?
[09:20.74]Is this how much of a fucking weirdo I've become?
[09:27.17]Let's go.
[09:29.23]I was supposed to pick Ranger.
[09:33.31]Why?
[09:36.87]I don't think I'm supposed to do that.
[09:43.77]I have to do vodka for this game?
[09:47.39]I don't have any vodka.
[09:49.55]I would have just got a coffee and then was like, oh, can you grab me like a beer too?
[09:53.42]Like a fucking sicko.
[09:55.98]Alright, Metro Electro!
[09:58.09]Use your mouse to look around.
[10:00.79]This is a dark game.
[10:02.41]This shit is really good, by the way.
[10:05.17]Do I really have to go back and pick Ranger?
[10:08.05]Why do I have to do that?
[10:23.74]We'll have to get through the military outpost.
[10:26.22]WASD.
[10:27.70]Of course, like every other video game in the world.
[10:30.64]Yes.
[10:31.72]Yes.
[10:32.92]Yes.
[10:36.16]Am I really going to get shit for this if I don't do this?
[10:42.60]Okay.
[10:43.20]Alright.
[10:43.58]Alright.
[10:44.22]Okay.
[10:44.78]Everybody calm down.
[10:46.90]Okay.
[10:48.60]We'll do Ranger.
[10:49.24]Fine.
[10:50.66]Survival.
[10:52.40]Ranger.
[10:53.97]The HUD and UI are limited and hints are disabled for increased immersion.
[10:57.59]Your enemies do more damage, but so do you.
[11:00.15]Combat is tense.
[11:03.92]Every bullet counts.
[11:04.60]Here we go.
[11:09.78]Increase the brightness a little bit.
[11:12.54]I like that.
[11:13.22]I like it when it's a little bit more bright.
[11:15.44]Did you guys just fuck me so bad?
[11:16.74]What happened?
[11:17.10]Did you guys just screw me?
[11:17.88]Huh?
[11:19.95]Huh?
[11:23.11]Hey, cheers to that.
[11:31.71]This is dangerous.
[11:33.06]Don't do this.
[11:35.12]Don't ever do anything that I do on camera.
[11:38.52]All right, we're Ranger.
[11:39.76]So right now he reaches down and he goes, Ranger!
[11:44.14]And he grabs my hand.
[11:45.56]Is the face cam too fucking big?
[11:46.62]It kind of is.
[11:47.42]Do we even need the fucking face cam right now?
[11:53.09]I feel like I don't even want this on.
[11:58.07]Ready, watch.
[11:58.73]Ranger!
[12:03.79]Ranger!
[12:04.25]No, it's gotcha.
[12:05.47]Gotcha.
[12:06.82]Yes, yes.
[12:07.40]Okay, of course you need the face cam.
[12:08.88]Sure.
[12:09.30]Okay.
[12:09.60]Alright, WASD.
[12:10.04]Toggle.
[12:10.40]That's not what I like.
[12:11.22]I have somebody set up.
[12:11.98]Open the gate.
[12:12.44]Okay.
[12:23.74]Just turn on the faucet.
[12:25.68]Just like a regular shower head.
[12:28.52]Am I like insane or am I getting frame drops in this game right now?
[12:35.56]I might be insane.
[12:36.24]How's the audio?
[12:38.74]Am I too loud?
[12:39.46]Is it too loud?
[12:40.00]Is the game too loud?
[12:40.86]How are we too loud?
[12:43.84]How do you crouch?
[12:44.62]Control.
[12:45.08]Yeah, dude.
[12:46.01]Something weird here.
[12:54.04]Something don't feel right.
[12:58.83]Game is too quiet.
[12:59.61]Well, the game is like running.
[13:01.37]It's like really stuttery.
[13:06.87]Like really stuttery.
[13:08.24]Hold on.
[13:14.10]No motion blur.
[13:14.78]I'm going to turn tessellation off.
[13:17.50]Maybe I should turn v-sync on.
[13:18.62]I'm going to put it on high.
[13:25.97]Did that fix it?
[13:28.25]No.
[13:29.71]Fuck, man.
[13:33.19]This is running like shit.
[13:36.35]What the F is tessellation?
[13:37.52]Tessellation is when the ground, uh... The ground, like grass, and, uh...
[13:45.74]and snow is multiplied like ten thousand five hundred million times and and you can like dig down deeper like uh you know like the sims not the sims uh roller coaster tycoon you know you can like dig down into the ground it's like that's what tessellation is it's the ability to dig down what is that well I want to be oh I was looking at the wrong direction what is wrong with my guy oh
[14:12.88]Alright, well, this is a werewolf game.
[14:14.10]Got it.
[14:14.78]What's wrong with my guy?
[14:15.70]I'm just, like, choking.
[14:20.09]Oh, I gotta put a gas mask on.
[14:21.33]Got it!
[14:24.55]Well, I'm currently having trouble with this game's frame rate.
[14:31.77]Like... It's hard for me to pay attention.
[14:37.51]I got the ga- I got it on.
[14:38.37]I figured it out.
[14:39.38]I'm out of bullets.
[14:40.66]Do I have another gun?
[14:43.15]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[14:45.14]Like, stab somebody?
[14:49.24]I have no bullets.
[14:50.68]So they weren't kidding, and actually they were like, oh, by the way, when you play on Ranger mode, it's gonna be fucking really hard.
[14:57.16]I gotta fix this.
[14:57.80]This is unplayable.
[14:58.88]I'm gonna have to turn on something else.
[15:03.20]V-Sync.
[15:04.60]Let's turn off, like, let's turn, like, the... I can't even turn this off.
[15:09.79]Oh, boy.
[15:18.52]Somehow that's worse.
[15:21.52]No, that's way worse.
[15:23.60]Oh, come on, man.
[15:24.92]Really?
[15:26.20]You're going to pull this shit on me right now.
[15:29.95]Hold on.
[15:35.65]PhysX.
[15:36.45]What do you mean PhysX?
[15:43.55]Wait, there's a PhysX?
[15:47.81]Advanced physics.
[15:49.47]You need to restart the game.
[15:50.77]Okay.
[15:52.97]What?
[15:54.99]Alright, go back.
[15:57.17]Let's quit the game again.
[15:59.75]Sure, I'd love to quit the game.
[16:02.17]Turn it off and turn it on again.
[16:03.31]What the fuck is it?
[16:09.45]Seems like it's going to be kind of fun.
[16:11.57]But this time I'm not going to just hold the button down.
[16:13.79]You know what I mean?
[16:16.41]Yeah.
[16:20.90]Yeah, deep silver.
[16:22.82]We all know.
[16:28.72]Unplug.
[16:32.40]Is that what he gave 50 bucks?
[16:33.52]I can't see it.
[16:34.00]I need to see it though.
[16:39.34]Metro Redux is inspired by true events.
[16:41.68]Well, that's fucking interesting.
[16:43.76]Alright, let me just make sure this worked.
[16:45.96]We might have to panic.
[16:47.64]We might have to panic play a different game.
[16:52.69]It's technically not a video setting.
[16:54.74]It's weird.
[16:55.18]All right, hold on.
[16:56.18]Let me move this out of the way.
[17:00.08]Rafrod, thank you for the $50, dude.
[17:03.12]Make sure your bald coin miner isn't still running in the background.
[17:07.97]Don't worry, my bald coin miner is not currently running.
[17:13.53]It's all good.
[17:13.93]It's turned off, but thank you so much, Rafrod, for the $50 fucking dollars.
[17:19.72]Alright, please work.
[17:20.74]Because I would like to play this game.
[17:27.77]That did?
[17:28.09]Did that do it?
[17:29.37]I think that did it.
[17:32.05]Yep.
[17:33.51]Alright, so note to self, my computer cannot handle advanced physics.
[17:38.92]So I only have... How many bullets do I have?
[17:41.14]I don't even know how many bullets I have.
[17:44.38]They don't even tell me how many fucking bullets I have!
[17:52.07]Just keep going.
[17:57.29]It's so stuttery on your end.
[17:58.77]Is it really?
[17:59.15]What do you mean it didn't fix?
[18:00.39]It fixed it for me.
[18:01.47]Yeah, PhysX is a... I deleted PhysX, so it works fine.
[18:12.58]Hold R. It's definitely running way better.
[18:16.98]It's bad for you guys.
[18:18.68]It's actually bad for you guys now.
[18:21.99]What?
[18:32.70]Move the face cam.
[18:34.60]Look, why don't I just like go like, let me just turn off the face cam for now.
[18:37.34]You don't need it right now.
[18:40.74]You know, we don't need the face cam right now.
[18:43.17]It's just getting in the way.
[18:47.79]Seems like nobody's home.
[18:52.25]Who said that?
[18:55.17]Well, everybody loves face cam nowadays, huh?
[19:01.03]Don't worry, I just want it off for like a few minutes.
[19:05.57]I want it off for five minutes, alright?
[19:09.98]I'll put the fucking gas mask on, dude.
[19:12.10]Alright, here they come.
[19:13.94]Here come the aliens!
[19:15.86]Oops.
[19:17.12]Bullets count.
[19:22.66]Okay, don't waste ammo.
[19:30.73]How many shots in the head does it take to kill one of these rats?
[19:32.29]I don't know what that shotgun that guy has.
[19:38.53]That thing seems way better.
[19:42.85]I'm dead.
[19:43.95]I died.
[19:51.81]Slideshow?
[19:54.11]Stop it.
[19:54.85]Stop saying that.
[19:55.75]Is that true?
[19:56.45]Are you guys like fucking with me right now?
[20:07.46]What?
[20:10.90]Oh my fucking god.
[20:20.76]It says I haven't dropped any frames.
[20:23.40]It was fine till I had to shoot.
[20:24.76]Well, that's such a pain in the ass.
[20:28.72]It only happened when I was shooting the zombies.
[20:30.60]All right, let me... Wait a minute.
[20:32.73]Turn V-Sync off?
[20:33.65]V-Sync is off.
[20:35.37]I think it's like an OBS problem.
[20:40.13]Yeah, I get what the fuck is going on.
[20:46.18]Nobody fucking move.
[20:48.42]I'll be right back.
[20:49.54]Nobody move.
[20:50.19]I'm not even kidding.
[20:50.99]I'm literally turning the stream off and on because OBS sucks asshole sometimes.
[20:58.53]We're going to try this.
[20:59.21]Ready?
[21:00.09]You tell me if that fixed it.
[21:03.69]You tell me.
[21:08.97]Are we good?
[21:12.67]You tell me if it gets any worse.
[21:21.10]I gotta like, do something, move around.
[21:26.58]Seems better.
[21:33.23]Stop moving my fingers.
[21:35.41]Alright, here we go.
[21:36.17]This is the real test right here to see if I have to restart the stream.
[21:42.21]Let's see what happens.
[21:44.63]Here comes the gas mask.
[21:49.90]Turn on fraps.
[21:51.03]Alright, I'm gonna shoot the gun.
[21:54.91]Oh, how we doing?
[21:58.81]We're gonna wait till like more of these rats get on screen.
[22:07.41]How we doing?
[22:08.17]Is it fine?
[22:12.47]It's alright so far?
[22:14.99]It's just bad.
[22:15.67]What the fuck?
[22:20.34]I can't even tell what you guys are even saying.
[22:22.12]I think you guys have been fucking with me the whole time.
[22:33.23]It might be this area.
[22:36.85]No, you gotta pull it together.
[22:42.55]Okay, you got it.
[22:50.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[22:51.27]So you're telling me that I was about to turn off the stream.
[22:56.90]I was about to turn the fucking stream off and on to change the setting and you guys are just fucking with me this whole time?
[23:14.96]I like that.
[23:15.76]Okay, honestly, I thought the moon was just aiming at him.
[23:19.30]Doesn't it look like that?
[23:34.09]The game's just badly optimized.
[23:35.47]Well, I mean, it is running perfectly for me.
[23:42.52]Like, it couldn't be running any smoother for me right now.
[23:52.76]Can I get on the back of that?
[23:59.57]It's OBS.
[24:00.27]Just restart.
[24:03.88]God damn it.
[24:09.26]It's definitely something to do with how I'm capping it through OBS.
[24:13.20]I mean, I could try this.
[24:17.38]Let's give something else a try here.
[24:18.92]Hold on.
[24:21.02]Let's do... Let's do this.
[24:27.25]I'll give you my preview back.
[24:29.39]You guys tell me if this causes any concern.
[24:35.18]Hey, look, there you are.
[24:35.82]All right, let me see.
[24:39.30]No.
[24:40.66]God damn it.
[24:41.58]Really?
[24:43.84]That's so annoying.
[24:48.30]Lower the graphics quality?
[24:49.50]That's not what's going on.
[24:50.32]It's running perfect.
[24:51.22]It's running like crystal clear for me.
[25:06.84]The FPS drops for two seconds.
[25:15.51]Well, if it gets to be unbearable, I'll try something else.
[25:22.11]Why does this shit randomly fucking happen to me?
[25:26.60]I don't understand.
[25:30.98]Why do some games just become un-fucking-bearable when they're captured?
[25:37.29]Stay calm and shoot the zombies.
[25:39.17]Put it on a t-shirt.
[25:42.67]Alright, so can I get on the machine gun?
[25:47.05]Oh, there's a guy already sitting on the toilet machine gun.
[25:54.30]I'm dead.
[25:56.10]I just did like two front flips.
[26:01.44]What is going on?
[26:10.51]okay watch out for the gargoyle oh no nice slideshow so that was that was in the future okay go play world of warcraft
[26:40.15]It gets bad for five seconds.
[26:42.51]I might just have to drop my OBS preset with this game for some reason.
[26:50.26]We'll see.
[26:52.32]I'm drinking Sprite Cranberry?
[26:54.02]That's not Sprite Cranberry.
[26:57.08]I mean, you're close, you're close.
[26:59.24]I think I just crashed the game.
[27:01.27]No, we're good.
[27:02.33]So it's Down East Cranberry.
[27:07.65]It's fine here.
[27:08.27]It's fine because we're looking at a pre-rendered image, aren't we?
[27:11.49]Am I going to play Monster Hunter World?
[27:16.03]Absolutely.
[27:19.70]Monster Hunter World is the 2017 most anticipated game for 2018.
[27:21.32]That's a pre-recorded image.
[27:39.71]Uh, copy.
[27:41.71]Doodles.
[27:43.32]Handkerchiefs.
[27:46.66]Oh, wow.
[27:48.38]That's pretty revolutionary for a game that came out in 2014, right?
[27:52.72]You can turn it off and on lights and stuff.
[27:56.16]Can you turn this off too?
[27:56.90]No, of course not.
[28:01.28]Have I read the books?
[28:01.92]I have never read the Metro books.
[28:05.69]All I know is that it's a fairly well-received game.
[28:10.43]How do I level up?
[28:10.87]Metro 2033 is your favorite book ever.
[28:11.81]I've never read it.
[28:35.38]Okay, let's do this, too.
[28:37.17]We might have to be a, like, fucking medium streamer.
[28:41.47]And I can't turn this off.
[28:43.91]Am I about to be a medium fucking streamer?
[28:48.05]I guess I am.
[28:52.63]Yep.
[29:00.08]Mommy, do we need to report?
[29:02.06]My brother is in the hospital.
[29:04.80]What about Alexei?
[29:06.86]He was at the outpost.
[29:08.74]No visitors.
[29:09.82]No visitors.
[29:10.88]Okay.
[29:12.48]Alright, for a second, I thought that was... Oh, never mind.
[29:16.86]Didn't fix it.
[29:18.12]Come on, Alex.
[29:19.34]Hello, Artyom.
[29:21.16]This is just one of those magic games that when it's captured by people, sometimes it just don't fucking work.
[29:27.90]Not much improvement.
[29:32.97]God, when will this ever end?
[29:36.21]I can't take it anymore.
[29:40.47]Alright, well I'm going to try something.
[29:45.61]Nobody, don't move.
[29:46.89]Nobody move.
[29:50.95]Nobody move.
[29:53.51]Nobody move.
[29:54.11]Here's what we're going to do.
[29:56.47]I wonder if I can do it.
[29:57.42]I might not have to turn the stream off.
[29:58.76]I might not have to do it.
[30:00.52]Hold on.
[30:02.71]Nobody fucking move.
[30:05.95]Can I do this while the stream is on?
[30:07.53]If the stream turns off, I'm coming right back in 10 seconds.
[30:14.34]Nobody move.
[30:14.78]There we go.
[30:19.18]Is it possible to do this midstream?
[30:21.40]Let's find out.
[30:25.65]Nobody move.
[30:30.03]There we go.
[30:35.81]Did I have to turn it off?
[30:36.67]Are we good?
[30:42.85]Did that do it?
[30:43.64]Are we good?
[30:44.04]I don't think I have to turn the stream off.
[30:49.12]Maybe I do.
[31:00.32]No, it didn't do it.
[31:01.38]I have to turn the stream off.
[31:07.83]Whatever.
[31:14.17]Why is everything black?
[31:17.08]It's Hunter.
[31:17.72]Mutants don't knock first.
[31:19.02]Open the damn gate.
[31:22.82]Stream dead.
[31:23.56]Stream's live.
[31:24.22]I mean, I can look over and I can see the CPU.
[31:30.92]It seems fine, but... Welcome to Exhibition, Hunter.
[31:38.34]Watch it.
[31:43.56]I will never come back here again.
[31:45.44]What's up?
[31:48.19]Oh, it's crazy.
[31:48.99]It's snowy.
[31:50.65]There are giant rats.
[31:52.03]Okay.
[32:06.15]This guy's dressed like a fucking World War I pilot.
[32:08.37]Is he a World War I pilot?
[32:09.57]Yeah.
[32:09.85]Take the card.
[32:10.35]What card?
[32:10.65]Oh, it's the Star Wars movie?
[32:12.19]It's all 6.1 out of 10.
[32:35.90]6.2.
[32:35.98]I didn't move that fast.
[32:37.02]Hey, hey, hey!
[32:37.46]Let me in there!
[32:37.86]What?
[32:38.08]Why are you blocking me off?
[32:39.44]And get that fucking moon sniper away from me.
[32:41.24]What do you want me to do?
[32:42.14]Give me a weapon?
[32:43.70]Can I burn his face with a cigarette?
[32:47.31]I don't think so.
[33:07.01]Get a gun.
[33:08.29]Get a gun.
[33:09.55]Where's the gun?
[33:11.68]Gun inside the guy's bag?
[33:14.46]Where's the gun?
[33:15.54]Where's their gun?
[33:16.68]Alright, there's a monster in here now.
[33:22.63]I thought I was ringing that bell.
[33:23.77]I was like, why is my left click a bell?
[33:33.41]Never paying attention.
[33:34.84]I'm sorry.
[33:35.80]I've been spending the last 20 minutes being told my stream is unwatchable.
[33:39.82]So, like, sorry I didn't listen to where the gun was.
[33:46.91]Headshot.
[34:05.37]Only when enemies are on screen.
[34:07.55]Oh, you mean like 95% of the whole fucking game?
[34:10.87]Headshot.
[34:34.53]I really wish I could, like, enjoy this video game.
[34:37.05]And not have to worry about the fact that it can't be fucking captured through OBS.
[34:43.97]Because apparently my computer's not good enough, even though that's absolutely not the fucking case.
[34:49.37]Where's this fucking blue locker?
[34:55.89]I would love to, like, immerse myself in this fucking video game.
[35:04.06]Orange locker?
[35:06.12]Oh, this thing!
[35:07.70]Hooray!
[35:08.24]That guy did- that guy did a smite- that guy- that was just Fenrir from Smites 3.
[35:22.52]That guy's still alive.
[35:41.01]Shit.
[35:42.67]I'm alright.
[35:53.13]Alright.
[35:56.13]I'll be right back.
[36:00.49]I'm turning the stream off and turning it back on.
[36:01.98]This is fucking stupid.
[36:03.50]I don't want the stream to be like the frames to drop every fucking 18 seconds.
[36:07.86]I'll be right back.
[36:09.20]Nobody go anywhere.
[36:35.45]Fucking horse shit.
[36:44.43]Give me a goddamn fucking break.
[36:51.22]Somebody just said troubleshoot before the stream.
[36:54.08]Alright, let me tell you something.
[36:55.96]My game is running perfect.
[36:57.92]I look over on OBS, it's perfect.
[37:01.29]It's something weird going on with how it's getting pulled into Twitch.
[37:05.89]There's no way I could have troubleshooted this before this stream.
[37:08.09]It's literally an impossibility.
[37:10.09]So let's try again.
[37:11.39]How's it now?
[37:23.63]the dark ones are not simple mutants they're homo novice the next step in evolution you've heard about survival of the fittest guess what good good are we good what's happened to you alex you can go like lambs like my streaming machine has a crack in it whatever life I got with teeth and claws
[37:45.01]Don't need to have a short temper about it.
[37:47.19]You must be new around here because this shit happens like once a week.
[37:52.49]Let's wait for the monsters to come on screen and for my game to go to 10 frames a second.
[38:23.04]You can't drop frames if you never turn the stream on.
[38:36.13]But I have zero drop frames.
[38:49.26]Tell him what's happened to me and what's stirring in the northern tunnels.
[38:54.22]Show this to Miller so he knows I've sent you.
[38:57.28]That's some good cider.
[38:59.26]Don't let me down.
[39:02.31]If we are to survive, this threat must be eliminated, no matter the cost.
[39:09.81]Turn the FPS counter on.
[39:24.55]This is my first time ever playing Metro 23D3.
[39:26.62]Yes.
[39:27.08]Ever.
[39:28.78]I have not played it for one second.
[39:36.40]Overlay is not even working.
[39:41.95]Well, it seems like a fun game so far.
[39:45.61]The same exact shit happened with Assassin's Creed Origins.
[39:48.11]I don't know what it is sometimes with games and trying to stream them.
[39:52.55]They just don't fucking work.
[39:53.33]Yeah, but this game is good.
[39:55.03]That's the difference.
[39:55.85]I would assume.
[39:56.37]Probably, right?
[40:18.61]Let's go.
[40:18.91]Too many people talking at the same time here.
[40:23.35]Can I ride the tricycle?
[40:24.99]There's a lot of... I've heard there's a lot of replayability in this game.
[40:28.43]A lot of different endings.
[40:50.59]Is this where I buy supplies?
[41:00.57]Bathroom?
[41:05.49]Nope.
[41:06.03]That's number nine.
[41:07.17]That's the amount of frames my stream was.
[41:12.76]Everyone just like talks while they're doing things.
[41:15.68]This lady is just sweeping and talking.
[41:18.12]Everybody has like demons in their head.
[41:21.09]Listen to this.
[41:23.63]Who are they talking to?
[41:28.13]Everyone's having a conversation inside their own head.
[41:30.09]She's talking to the broom.
[41:34.26]Are we in a prison?
[41:46.06]Let's see how many people are actually speaking to themselves.
[41:49.30]Two gold bullet guns?
[41:50.86]Two golden bullets?
[41:51.84]This thing's taken apart.
[41:54.84]Hey, hey, hey!
[41:57.11]Easy, kid!
[42:01.75]Is this kid chasing this other kid with a hammer?
[42:07.17]Why are no adults doing anything about this?
[42:17.21]Alright, Jesus Christ.
[42:23.25]You know, it's Russia.
[42:25.41]Alright, move out of the way.
[42:27.21]Let's do it.
[42:30.31]Go to the armory and get geared up.
[42:31.87]Holy shit, dude.
[42:33.71]Wow.
[42:33.85]That guy was excited.
[42:47.33]Armory, right?
[42:48.07]Does that say armory in Japanese?
[42:49.65]I mean, bro, it's Japanese.
[42:50.87]Alright, we got submachine gun.
[42:52.45]That's what they call the bastard gun.
[42:54.43]Sure.
[42:54.53]Okay.
[42:54.71]Can I have it?
[43:20.77]Could I have that gun?
[43:34.40]How do you pick up the gun?
[43:37.46]Okay, it's hold E, not press E. So it's hold E for gun.
[43:46.21]Okay, here's your universal fucking...
[43:51.95]Give me a break, guy.
[43:54.45]Like, I pressed E and you have to hold the button down.
[43:57.95]Yeah, give me the gold.
[43:59.65]I would love to.
[44:00.39]Uh, does this use ammo?
[44:02.11]Take a look at that.
[44:02.53]That's a fucking bullseye.
[44:23.22]What's this thing, shoot batteries?
[44:26.00]Oh, I get it, because it's like post-apocalyptic and shit, so they don't have any bullets anymore.
[44:29.48]You shoot AA batteries.
[44:31.70]I get it.
[44:32.06]That's, well, resourceful, right?
[44:34.83]Especially if they're dead.
[44:35.59]If they're drained batteries, like, that makes perfect sense.
[44:38.33]Alright, let's go.
[44:48.36]Mm-hmm.
[44:49.46]Guy with the guitar?
[44:52.22]Hey, play me that one song.
[44:53.34]Alright, let's just get out of here.
[44:59.38]What do you got for me?
[45:00.88]What do you got, boss?
[45:03.47]Good.
[45:09.48]I take his gun if I hold e that our station is creating an alliance with ria we're sending them a couple of rail cars with humanitarian goods some weapons and some miscellaneous gear that's the cargo you'll be looking after it's not a very long trip it should not be why did I get a good I got a good boy point one thing before you go I can see that you look up to hunter
[45:32.69]Pick up the vodka.
[45:33.35]Who's on that?
[45:34.75]I don't know.
[45:35.67]Come home!
[45:36.79]Oh, it's actually my dad.
[45:38.79]Alright, let's go.
[45:40.25]Come home and get the caravan and come home, my son.
[45:42.54]Alright, here we go.
[45:43.40]Mm-hmm.
[46:04.85]I gotta go... Is there like a menu?
[46:13.57]Or what?
[46:16.79]Wow, look at these pigs.
[46:18.89]That's interesting.
[46:19.51]Do I get a pig companion in the game?
[46:22.02]Okay.
[46:30.96]What the hell am I... Am I holding a notebook like a telephone?
[46:41.64]What am I doing with this?
[46:44.32]No, no, the lighter.
[46:46.46]I'm ready.
[46:46.94]It's a boombox.
[47:00.59]Nice bullet lighter.
[47:01.77]That's like Boston subway system.
[47:03.61]Yeah.
[47:03.93]Wait, is this one of those old school cartoons where you go like this?
[47:25.92]That's so cool.
[47:26.52]Can I do that?
[47:26.92]No, I want to do that.
[47:28.18]I want to do this.
[47:28.72]How come only one guy does this?
[47:30.80]Shouldn't more than one person be doing that to help out?
[47:55.09]I gotta go get the Jedi.
[48:04.55]We're gonna get ambushed.
[48:07.05]This guy's gonna get, like, attacked.
[48:16.11]I used to make regular trips to police, but getting there now requires a lot of luck.
[48:20.52]That or being from the city.
[48:21.62]Oh, I'd love to ride that thing.
[48:23.36]Hanza connects to the whole metro and has a lot of stations, but doesn't welcome outsiders.
[48:29.34]That guy's dead?
[48:30.60]This guy?
[48:31.29]You have to go through the Reds, the Nazis, or your regular bandits.
[48:35.55]Is that a cane or is he just taunting?
[48:38.71]If they're not fighting everyone else, they're warring with each other.
[48:41.21]Are people just walking this?
[48:44.68]Why didn't we just walk?
[48:45.52]That seemed like it was very, very close.
[48:53.03]This is almost like we're, like, hazing this guy.
[48:55.45]Yeah, you're gonna get us into that wagon, and you're gonna push us, like, 500 feet, you little shit.
[49:03.66]You have to use the service tunnel bypassing Alekseevskaya.
[49:09.51]I'm having trouble hearing him.
[49:10.55]Open it, please.
[49:12.38]You know, I need, like... There.
[49:14.66]It's one of those games where it has a spatial audio, so sometimes I don't hear what half the people are saying.
[49:37.47]Because having two earphones in makes me want to throw up.
[49:39.61]Who's that, like a Disney World employee?
[49:44.81]Alright, here we go.
[49:54.50]There were no batteries in there, thank god.
[49:56.44]Alright, this is just an on-rails shooter.
[50:02.45]We reloaded?
[50:05.37]If you help push the labor, we'll get there sooner.
[50:08.23]Okay.
[50:10.44]Okay, Eugene, you go help the men.
[50:12.20]We should move faster here.
[50:13.78]You watch the back, aren't you?
[50:15.00]Is this game a real shooter?
[50:16.06]I'll help.
[50:16.62]That way we'll get to Riga in no time, right?
[50:19.12]No, we should get out of here sooner.
[50:20.94]I know it's not.
[50:21.54]I'm just kidding.
[50:21.92]It's scary when they're around.
[50:23.52]And I pity them.
[50:24.80]Them?
[50:25.98]Who, who, who them?
[50:27.46]Can you hear them?
[50:28.36]We?
[50:29.24]Who do you mean, them?
[50:30.98]What are you talking about?
[50:31.90]What are we looking for?
[50:33.28]What the hell is going on?
[50:35.81]Watch the back?
[50:36.51]What's going on with this guy's head?
[50:43.70]What is going on?
[50:44.64]Why is everybody like getting their brains melted?
[50:55.61]Did I lose?
[51:00.52]Alright.
[51:12.39]You gotta watch out for the Enderman.
[51:15.77]That's your one and only Minecraft reference you're gonna get in like a year.
[51:22.21]This is just the Death Stranding trailer.
[51:27.44]It is.
[51:44.11]Bumped into the fucking pillar.
[51:47.45]I thought he, like, cross-checked the pillar.
[51:51.31]That would have been perfect.
[51:53.71]So now I have alien powers.
[51:54.89]Right.
[52:02.42]This is Inception.
[52:03.38]We all gonna wake up on the airplane?
[52:07.06]Oh, fuck.
[52:07.76]I hope everyone's seen Inception.
[52:10.13]Fuck.
[52:11.41]Hang it down, aliens!
[52:13.07]I'm gonna miss.
[52:14.17]Whoa!
[52:42.42]Was that supposed to happen?
[52:45.46]What was- E!
[52:48.26]Press E!
[52:48.84]Wha- I could've saved him?
[52:58.27]Are you serious?
[53:00.27]Oh, fuck.
[53:03.98]Ah!
[53:11.21]Oh shit, I'm trying to aim down sights.
[53:12.49]Here they come.
[53:21.35]Another one.
[53:24.75]Jump right in the air.
[53:27.72]Come on, jump.
[53:33.56]One more jump.
[53:34.26]Jump in front of me.
[53:35.16]Third time's the charm.
[53:35.82]Come on.
[53:40.92]What am I waiting for?
[53:41.54]We're almost at the roadblock!
[53:43.46]Just a little bit left, come on!
[53:44.84]Come on!
[53:50.09]Alright, I thought that guy... Oh shit!
[54:01.11]Is that supposed to happen?
[54:05.84]I don't know what's supposed to happen, what's scripted and what's not scripted.
[54:18.85]I'm gonna get shot.
[54:19.94]Oh god, I should probably run.
[54:21.42]I should run towards them, right?
[54:24.26]It's me!
[54:25.26]It's just me!
[54:25.96]Don't shoot me!
[54:26.64]Uh, you're very clearly shooting through me.
[54:33.35]Get me up there.
[54:37.09]Burn.
[54:45.17]Nice work!
[54:47.94]Alright, let me just take out the revolver right now.
[54:49.67]That's the best weapon of choice, I think.
[54:50.95]Yeah, I think I need a drink, too.
[54:53.35]You know what I'm saying?
[54:57.45]That was fucking cool.
[54:58.59]That was cool.
[54:58.99]This game's cool.
[55:00.57]Glad it took us like an hour and 12 minutes to get it to work on stream.
[55:03.65]But that was... That's pretty cool.
[55:11.30]Is more of the game like that?
[55:12.20]Or did they blow it all in the first 10 minutes?
[55:15.77]It gets better.
[55:16.61]Well, good.

[62:25.50]What the fuck?
[62:27.24]Here's a computer.
[62:40.10]I think my neighbor might be like watching fucking wrestling.
[62:50.89]I must have a tab open.
[62:52.03]That was fucking weird.
[62:59.37]Anyways.
[63:01.23]Let's go.
[63:02.77]Let's continue.
[63:03.65]Wait.
[63:14.58]It's the game?
[63:16.16]Why would there be that in the game?
[63:17.22]I wouldn't be able to hear that through my headphones.
[63:26.17]The nearest neighbor for me is over a mile away.
[63:28.67]Do you think I live in like a gated community?
[63:31.51]Where the fuck do you think I live?
[63:32.59]Yeah, the nearest neighbor is like fucking two miles down the road.
[63:54.51]Push that forward.
[64:05.09]I'm a rich man, a rich streamer.
[64:17.27]Queen of hearts.
[64:18.43]I mean, spades.
[64:19.15]I mean, uh... Spades.

[64:25.19]The handcart ride is over.
[64:26.11]Let's go.
[64:32.90]I didn't just shoot.
[64:33.52]You did.
[64:35.30]You did that.
[64:38.10]I'm gonna let him use as much ammo as I possibly can make somebody use.
[64:41.17]...groups of people.
[64:42.99]But if you're alone, watch your ass.
[64:51.84]I need to search the environment for ammo and shit.
[64:54.33]I've missed so many already.
[64:56.63]Well, let's start searching.
[65:00.51]Why am I in slow motion?
[65:01.25]Alright, here we go.
[65:01.87]Search the environment.
[65:02.61]You got it.
[65:03.09]See?
[65:04.17]Get the bugs off my face.
[65:09.80]I just dropped... Did I just drop out six perfectly good shots?
[65:15.32]I think I did.
[65:16.84]I think I just dropped like six real like regular bullets.
[65:35.21]Level 3 helmet.
[65:37.75]Wait, I gotta check in this room.
[65:43.19]Nothing in there.
[65:46.51]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[65:48.31]Body.
[65:51.14]He has a couple of flares on him.
[65:55.14]Anything else?
[65:56.62]No, that's... What happened?
[66:00.98]What was that?
[66:03.46]Watch it.
[66:16.00]Stop dropping all the bullets out.
[66:21.54]I'm supposed to be following that guy.
[66:23.56]Wait a second.
[66:24.18]Wait a minute.
[66:24.60]Wait a minute.
[66:24.98]Wait a minute.
[66:27.30]Where's that guy go?
[66:30.18]I'm supposed to be following him.
[66:40.88]I'm putting my gas mask on.
[66:42.29]I think I feel like I need it.
[66:56.09]Shit.
[66:56.85]Caravaners.
[67:01.13]What difficulty is it?
[67:01.90]This is Ranger.
[67:02.60]Take the gas mask off.
[67:04.28]I just wiped my mouth.
[67:05.42]That's the gas mask.
[67:06.16]Don't disturb the cans.
[67:09.12]What is this?
[67:09.60]Fucking Home Alone 2?
[67:25.01]Watch your step.
[67:26.15]Any crunch or crack will give you away.
[67:28.55]Oh, no.
[67:33.32]Sure was a bad idea, wasn't it?
[67:38.94]Oh, a trip wire.
[67:40.96]An excellent way to get rid of the blind and daredevils.
[67:44.42]You get rid of you.
[67:49.16]They ain't going to get rid of me.
[67:50.37]They barricaded themselves.
[67:52.09]Short, we need to get closer.
[67:55.58]You got it.
[68:08.75]I'm fine.
[68:19.80]Turn off the stupid strobe light!
[68:29.80]I think that guy just said Ale Cuisine from Iron Chef.
[68:33.61]Ale Cuisine!
[68:39.47]Got him.
[68:45.72]Got him.
[68:47.74]Two down.
[68:51.50]Nice!
[68:58.37]That was like playing PUBG with somebody that knows what they're doing.
[69:02.78]I was in a squad with somebody that knew how to fucking play PUBG and I'm like the scared loser noob friend that they brought along to have like a conversation with.
[69:13.59]How do I heal?
[69:14.21]I did like the dumb shit in the beginning.
[69:16.01]What's the heal button?
[69:17.69]Let me heal.
[69:18.35]What is it?
[69:21.29]Uh, controls.

[69:35.84]Don't be an idiot.
[69:45.70]This reminds me of Stalker.
[69:52.21]is going on over there.
[70:04.69]Okay.
[70:12.52]A lot of fucking guys over there.
[70:33.08]One more, come on.
[70:37.94]I thought he was dead for a second.
[70:40.30]Oh my god, I'm shocking this guy in the fucking face.
[70:47.39]I don't know how I missed the first shot.
[70:50.51]What are you doing still alive?
[70:55.15]There's so much stuff I have to loot too.
[71:00.42]There's so much shit here, hold on.
[71:03.27]Don't leave without me.
[71:10.62]Just press E on everyone.
[71:13.52]You know what I'm saying?
[71:14.38]E for everyone.
[71:22.45]I just picked up a different gun.
[71:27.35]I only have one of these left.
[71:34.81]Alright, we did E for everyone.
[71:36.51]We're good to go.
[71:36.95]Intense, man.
[71:41.88]And there's a safe here, too.
[71:43.92]Can I break into it?
[71:44.68]No, I guess not.
[71:49.68]Metro Electro, man.
[71:50.55]This is fucking cool.
[71:53.99]Oh.
[71:55.63]Alright, get him.
[72:05.41]I'm so used to this.
[72:06.29]I hope I'm not fucking blowing it right now with the reloads.
[72:17.43]Move forward.
[72:20.35]Any more bodies to... Any more bodies to collect?
[72:31.13]Oh, turn that shit off.
[72:33.00]Pliers?
[72:33.34]No.
[72:36.36]Take off the gas mask.
[72:41.97]Okay, I thought G took it off.
[72:45.33]G wipes it.
[72:54.01]Loot everything, I'm trying to look around.
[73:03.12]Firewood, Kennedy's open, no.
[73:07.19]Some documents.
[73:09.87]I have a lot of shotgun shells, I think.
[73:11.23]I should be fine.
[73:17.05]Why would you do that?
[73:17.87]Why would you turn them all off?
[73:20.46]Okay, those are gas mask filters.
[73:23.96]Oh god, where are we?
[73:24.76]Alright, we're good.
[73:31.70]Change the difficulty.
[73:32.69]Why would I change the difficulty?
[73:48.31]He says as he jumps into the fucking murder lake.
[73:57.10]I'm not changing the difficulty.
[73:59.90]It's staying.
[74:00.52]Not even a difficulty change.
[74:08.46]Can't fix that.
[74:11.55]Alright.
[74:11.79]Shut it all off.
[74:13.61]Turn it all down.
[74:14.55]Shut it down.
[74:15.51]I don't know why I keep turning the lights off.
[74:17.89]This time I'm not going to miss the jump.
[74:44.85]I just got lazy.
[74:45.69]I thought I was actually going to make it.
[74:46.77]I'm going to turn the light off.
[74:50.11]Maybe that'll help.
[75:03.30]Maybe I will keep it on.
[75:07.10]Wait, can I keep moving or what?
[75:09.72]Oh, monster.
[75:13.35]What the fuck, dude?
[75:18.01]Why?
[75:19.55]What?
[75:31.69]You fucking deal with it.
[75:47.23]Always check your periphery.
[75:57.44]Fucking god damn it!
[76:02.78]Where are they coming from?
[76:04.67]Oh my god.
[76:05.63]I didn't know there was going to be more than one.
[76:19.28]I'm getting on top of the fucking game here.
[76:20.72]Gotta jump over here.
[76:21.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:22.70]Nice.
[76:22.96]Cool.
[76:23.38]Very cool.
[76:23.84]Another one.
[76:27.41]Hello.
[76:27.93]How are you?
[76:28.57]Nice to see you.
[76:31.13]Where am I getting hit from?
[76:32.03]Is that guy still alive?
[76:48.75]Can I loot these guys?
[76:49.47]They don't have anything, do they?
[76:50.97]No, of course not.
[76:56.92]I have plenty of bullets.
[76:59.80]Okay, I thought I could fall through there.
[77:00.82]I thought they were going to trap me.
[77:02.53]This is the slowest I've ever seen somebody run up a flight of stairs in my life.
[77:14.37]Where?
[77:14.85]Where are they coming from?
[77:15.57]I hear them sprinting.
[77:17.13]Oh god.
[77:17.93]Oh god.
[77:18.47]From what angle?
[77:19.28]Every angle?
[77:19.80]Or just one?
[77:20.22]Oh, they're coming from the front.
[77:22.84]Big guy.
[77:29.53]Come on, dude!
[77:30.19]Come on, dude!
[77:30.89]Come on!
[77:34.55]Where's my help?
[77:41.74]That's Ranger difficulty.
[77:42.80]Makes them run upstairs slower.
[77:47.38]Anything?
[77:57.73]Anything?
[77:58.31]Got something on your body?
[77:59.25]Yep.
[78:02.61]Lights off?
[78:03.03]Okay, they're playing the creepy violin.
[78:09.19]That means something's going to happen here.
[78:14.44]What is that?
[78:15.34]It's a rock.
[78:15.96]Never mind.
[78:30.39]Is that like sweat or is that water?
[78:31.89]Why would it be sweat on the outside?
[78:34.66]Oh, shit.
[78:37.46]Where?
[78:44.61]Oh my god!
[78:47.57]What a waste of fucking ammo.
[78:48.65]What a waste of ammo.
[78:58.42]That was a pretty good move on his part.
[79:02.80]That was a pretty nice tumble.
[79:06.19]Alright, let's go!
[79:07.71]Come on, hurry!

[116:25.75]Change the difficulty.
[116:29.33]Somebody said, I gotta move this too.
[116:30.73]I'm gonna move the face cam to a different spot.
[116:32.55]It's in like a fucking annoying spot, isn't it?
[116:34.43]Like over here?
[116:34.91]We'll go like this.
[116:37.43]We'll condense it just so you can still see like Santa because that's like...
[116:41.87]The creepy guy behind me.
[116:42.96]Is that better?
[116:43.38]That's better, right?
[116:48.36]Is that in a better spot?
[116:54.96]Press T. No, I just like screwed in some more, uh, some juice.
[117:01.29]Okay.
[117:05.33]Top right would be best, but I'm like not looking the right way.
[117:16.44]Check the safe?
[117:17.34]I thought I couldn't open the safes.
[117:21.76]Oh, not when they're special.
[117:23.28]Okay.
[117:36.75]Where is he?
[117:48.34]That's why I don't like having the face cam on.
[117:51.12]Clip that and look at what I just did.
[117:57.37]That's why I don't do fucking face cam.
[118:03.59]Can you not?
[118:04.23]I'm fucking sorry.
[118:10.60]Look at what I just did with my face.
[118:12.66]That's why I don't like having it on.
[118:27.37]What?
[118:28.69]Like, save the game?
[118:37.97]Save.
[118:38.73]Save it.
[118:39.75]Save your game.
[118:47.65]Toilets?
[118:48.01]Anything?
[118:49.74]Nothing.
[118:52.44]I'm going to try not to scream when the next thing... The reason why I'm screaming...
[119:01.68]What the fuck was that?
[119:05.72]Playing hide-and-go-seek with my niece again.
[119:07.63]Fucking Enderman.
[119:22.09]He's got some stuff on him.
[119:23.27]All right, the game saved.
[119:31.06]Can I go out this window?
[119:31.96]I mean, the shadows are going like crazy, right?
[119:36.74]Can I break through?
[119:37.40]No.
[119:39.82]Why did it say even here?
[119:50.18]Can I shoot out the window and just like hit the guy?
[120:00.83]Guess we're going down here.
[120:05.74]God, here comes the fucking jumpscare again.
[120:07.40]I'm not gonna yell, I swear to God, I promise.
[120:19.35]Where is he?
[120:29.07]What's wrong?
[120:38.88]What is this thing?
[120:41.79]Do I want this?
[120:59.94]Oh, he's waiting out there for me.
[121:05.53]Looks cool.
[121:06.05]I think we're gonna keep this.
[121:12.58]Hold R. What am I holding R for?
[121:22.73]Am I... Is this a super soaker?
[121:31.09]I'm overcharging the Super Soaker.
[121:32.88]Is this gonna kill me if I go down here?
[122:29.10]Okay.
[122:29.88]Uses steel balls.
[122:32.20]Well, I don't have any more of those.
[122:34.43]Not infinite ammo.
[122:36.73]Well, can I... Where's the fucking gargoyle?
[122:45.34]I can't hide in the van.
[122:47.12]That's such horseshit.
[122:47.90]Why can I not hide in there?
[122:48.84]Alright, we have to do some Super Mario fucking platform shit here.
[122:57.10]Dammit.
[122:57.66]Fuck me, dude.
[123:01.70]Great.
[123:02.32]Okay, cool.
[123:03.46]Where am I?
[123:05.02]Made it across.
[123:05.82]No, I didn't.
[123:14.29]The gargoyle isn't even moving.
[123:22.01]The fuck was that?
[123:23.09]Who's shooting?
[123:25.16]Obviously I need to let go like through the building and out the window or something I don't think I can even go that way Can I just go to the left and go up or something That would like make the most sense to me like there's a way to get out back there I
[123:53.01]Use the quest marker?
[123:53.97]I have to go that way.
[124:00.50]I'm just a fucking dumb streamer.
[124:03.60]I'm wasting all the filters.
[124:14.43]Get the monster to fly me out.
[124:20.96]Had five minutes left of that filter.
[124:22.80]It's interesting because I don't have that on my screen because Everybody told me I have to play Ranger which deletes your HUD.
[124:30.65]I've never played this game before Everybody calls me out for being stupid when basic shit like like how much air you have in your filter left I've never even known what that is Because I was told I had to play it on Ranger first I
[124:57.08]No, I can't turn it on now.
[124:58.24]If I turn it on now, that's going backwards.
[125:13.61]So, I have to go through this building and around.
[125:15.93]That's like the only way.
[125:16.72]That's the only possible way I can get around this.
[125:18.94]Unless there's another way to keep going down here and around, which I don't think there is.
[125:21.76]I mean, maybe there is.
[125:27.70]I don't... No, this is not.
[125:29.64]That's the only way I can go.
[125:31.54]I have to go, like, over here.
[125:47.25]Like, I need to go in here.
[125:48.27]I can't move that.
[126:01.73]I'm just going around in circles.
[126:07.78]Yeah.
[126:08.84]I'm up here.
[126:10.60]There's gotta be some way to go around.
[126:12.98]No, it wants me to be, like, right here.
[126:16.85]You want me to go, like, out there?
[126:22.75]I can't, like, squeeze through this.
[126:38.51]Alright.
[126:39.65]I was already up here.
[126:42.53]Why is the game saving right now?
[126:57.65]I remember the bathroom.
[126:58.59]Yeah, we were like already up here.
[127:03.99]God put this dumb thing down what a waste of fucking time How do I just look at my watch Wrap around here.
[127:29.24]Oh fuck.
[127:30.02]There he is.
[127:30.48]Oh
[127:32.26]Can I get him?
[127:33.61]Get to... Okay.
[127:38.71]Get to Paulus.
[127:39.73]Find a ranger named Miller.
[127:42.51]Okay.
[127:43.13]Why?
[127:44.59]Okay, put this down.
[127:46.13]Don't burn it.
[127:46.67]Alright, I have to hold Y to see what time it is.
[127:53.98]Okay.
[128:01.38]Got him.
[128:04.01]Oh, shit.
[128:06.85]Are you kidding me right now, dude?
[128:08.59]Why?
[128:08.91]Where did you?
[128:09.51]Alright.
[128:29.33]Use the silenced gun.
[128:30.99]There's no more bullets in that gun.
[128:35.43]So I have to go that way.
[128:39.56]Put the fucking thing down.
[128:42.54]Oh my god, why is this M?
[129:05.46]Press M for me lighter.
[129:08.58]Press M for me lighter.
[129:09.79]Oh, shh.
[129:19.91]Loot the body.
[129:20.71]Fucking give me a break.
[129:27.54]Give it to me.
[129:29.14]Give that to me.
[129:31.94]I can click.
[129:32.40]I'm looking at it right now.
[129:36.67]Can I not take that?
[129:37.63]I can't take that.
[129:39.19]That's just there for show.
[129:43.19]I cannot pick up the government cheese, alright?
[129:45.35]I can't get it.
[130:05.31]No?
[130:06.84]This game said there was stealth involved, so I'm gonna try it.
[130:16.68]What?!
[130:18.23]I can't move!
[130:35.81]What is going on?
[130:36.76]Alright.
[130:49.16]I got picked up.
[130:51.08]I got picked up by the fucking gargoyle.
[130:54.08]He was apparently behind me.
[130:56.72]Oh my lord.
[130:57.73]I got scooped up by the gargoyle.
[131:03.15]So we're just gonna shoot him.
[131:05.14]We're gonna just shoot.
[131:06.12]I'm just gonna land the shots.
[131:07.22]I'm gonna fucking shoot.
[131:08.62]Let's go, motherfuckers.
[131:10.14]Headshot.
[131:11.08]One.
[131:11.72]Headshot.
[131:12.24]Two.
[131:12.76]Come on over here.
[131:13.38]Guy on the right.
[131:15.28]Guy on the left after.
[131:29.17]You can't go on the ground like that!
[131:40.08]2x scope on a pistol.
[131:41.09]I don't know what I was fucking doing.
[131:42.25]I didn't even know this was in the game.
[131:43.47]I didn't even know this was possible.
[131:45.07]Guys, I did not know that these, like, upgrades were even possible.
[131:50.79]Right?
[131:51.04]Like, so, I go to the fucking store, and I'm like, oh, I would like to buy an item, please.
[131:55.32]I don't even know what this was.
[131:56.36]I'm just testing it out.
[131:57.14]I'm just testing.
[131:58.36]It's just a test.
[131:59.08]Like, everybody's freaking out.
[132:01.51]Now I gotta go get the cheese up there.
[132:29.23]Oh, you fucking dumb.
[132:33.37]Dad, give it to me.
[132:33.97]All right.
[132:34.49]Yeah.
[132:35.01]Eat it.
[132:36.05]Bingo.
[132:45.43]Anything in the car?
[132:46.99]No, just go.
[132:48.15]Get me inside again.
[132:49.71]Anything in the giant treasure chest?
[132:51.15]No, probably not.
[132:58.99]Crouch his head.
[132:59.53]Alright.
[133:05.40]Move the fish person out of the way and get in here.
[133:14.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[133:15.63]We got more stuff.
[133:16.89]I don't have any bullets in here, huh?
[133:20.99]Or do I?
[133:29.24]How do I see how much actual ammo I have?
[133:30.78]Is there a way for me to even know?
[133:34.40]How can I even see how much ammo is in the gun?
[133:37.46]Is it 43 or am I just wrong?
[133:50.21]What am I doing?
[133:53.65]Oh, I just put on a new gas mask?
[133:56.23]Hold M and right click.
[134:01.40]That's five.
[134:01.84]I fucking hate that lighter.
[134:04.56]I don't want the lighter.
[134:06.08]Why can't the lighter be bound to M?
[134:14.72]I gotta shine the light on the end of him, right?
[134:17.48]To make him go away.
[134:23.95]Pump it up.
[134:32.82]Where are we going?
[134:35.17]This way, apparently.
[134:36.21]Uh, why is it kind of like a gun here?
[134:42.55]Okay.
[134:45.23]That was just like a flashback.
[134:52.50]Alright.
[134:53.00]All I have to do is just find the guy.
[134:55.84]I hear somebody.
[134:56.92]Oh, no.
[134:57.88]Give me the slide.
[135:04.45]No, they're just running.
[135:06.36]Is that the only one?
[135:06.96]Oh, I thought somebody was doing... I thought somebody was doing like a come over here, flash the light in the window thing.
[135:16.52]That's what that looks like.
[135:17.96]It has to be.
[135:18.70]I think it is.
[135:21.52]No, that was somebody... No, that's not somebody getting my attention.
[135:23.36]I thought it was.
[135:23.86]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[135:31.10]Oh, come on.
[135:31.40]I hear like gunshots and bullets and stuff.
[135:48.06]Alright, where to now?
[135:49.46]Up there.
[135:49.88]Let me just check the back office here.
[135:52.42]Make sure there's no fucking shit everywhere.
[135:55.30]You know what I'm saying?
[135:56.86]Root beer.
[135:59.12]All kinds of root beer.
[136:01.44]No, it's not beer.
[136:04.20]Why would it be root beer?
[136:05.05]This is Russia.
[136:14.59]Back room.
[136:33.75]I'm so dead!
[137:01.16]So many people came in here.
[137:03.26]That was like 12 dogs.
[137:06.06]They weren't here before.
[137:08.38]Don't tell me I'm bad.
[137:09.68]I might be not good, but there was like a dozen fucking monsters in here.
[137:16.97]And there's not even anything in this, I gotta like hide back here.
[137:22.51]There's nothing even back here.
[137:26.31]There was no reason to come all the way back here.
[137:29.71]Let me break.
[137:32.10]Why were they in here?
[137:32.90]There's one.
[137:38.78]They're just perched.
[137:41.51]Fucking prairie dogs.
[137:47.33]Do they see me?
[137:48.15]They can't sense me or anything, right?
[137:53.45]Up here.
[137:53.79]I guess we're going this way.
[137:59.35]This is the way I came in, isn't it?
[138:03.51]No, I gotta go back here.
[138:09.83]I fucked with their beer last time.
[138:11.51]Oh, I hear somebody shooting.
[138:18.71]Is this my opportunity?
[138:19.41]Should I break a window and, like, run?
[138:27.41]I feel like I have to shoot this guy.
[138:30.69]Is there a silent kill?
[138:33.43]Is this like a stealth backstab or something?
[138:36.45]They might be.
[138:41.46]Yep.
[138:42.92]That was silent.
[138:44.66]Nobody even knew I did that.
[138:47.06]I think I need to heal, too.
[138:51.63]Yeah, I do.
[138:58.75]Keep going this way, right?
[138:59.93]Yep.
[139:12.44]I'm so paranoid out here.
[139:17.69]Fucking Seagull!
[139:22.39]Got him.
[139:27.45]Shit.
[139:28.33]Why did I do that?
[139:37.54]I'm safe.
[139:38.98]Oh, no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not.
[139:40.12]Back this way, back up, back up, back it this way, this way.
[139:41.84]Which way are they going?
[139:47.16]I'm good.
[139:56.69]They all ran down here.
[139:57.61]Oh, there he is.
[139:58.67]Is he eating something?
[140:00.33]I have a grenade, right?
[140:01.03]How do I throw grenades?
[140:01.87]What's the grenade button?
[140:18.12]He can't come down here, can he?
[140:28.09]He won't be able to make it down here.
[140:31.39]He knows where I am, though.
[140:32.31]Where's the objective?
[140:33.49]Straight ahead.
[140:36.69]Okay, go now.
[140:43.82]Why did I take the mask off?
[140:46.04]There it is!
[140:47.62]Alright, I made it.
[140:52.50]Somebody just threw a fucking grenade at me.
[140:54.54]What exploded?
[140:56.86]Put the gas mask on.
[140:57.98]Oh, shit.
[140:59.29]I don't have any more gas.
[141:07.69]Get out.
[141:09.27]Get out.
[141:10.09]Go.
[141:10.59]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[141:12.57]I have to go.
[141:17.81]Give me the gas!
[141:28.99]It's on my mouth.
[141:30.63]Two times.
[141:34.22]I'm fine.
[141:36.46]We can just do that whole thing again.
[141:37.60]Although, I'm out of gas.
[141:41.82]I need... I need gas.
[141:44.12]No, I don't have any.
[141:45.10]Does he?
[141:45.40]Does he?
[141:45.72]He might...
[141:52.09]Where's like the actual goal?
[141:53.27]I need to get to the goal.
[141:54.11]It was that room.
[141:55.95]Get there before I breathe to death.
[142:03.98]Which way?
[142:04.42]Which one?
[142:05.32]Down here.
[142:06.40]I gotta get over the mine.
[142:25.65]I tried to jump it.
[142:36.26]No, I was trying to loot the guy.
[142:38.02]I don't even know if I fucking looted him.
[142:41.70]I have no idea.
[142:42.36]I've lost control.
[142:46.87]Press E on the wire.
[142:51.02]There we go.
[142:51.38]Okay.
[142:52.60]And I can take it, too.
[142:53.62]That's fucking cool.
[142:54.64]Nice.
[142:55.76]This one over here, too.
[142:56.44]Alright, that's not gonna do anything good.
[143:03.44]Let's heal.
[143:12.53]What are these tripping... Nothing's even tripping.
[143:18.10]I ain't even fucking tripping right now.
[143:25.74]Okay, lots of random shit in this room.
[143:27.02]I'm gonna do my due diligence and try to find it.
[143:31.62]That was really close.
[143:34.06]Oh no.
[143:37.46]I'm out of... Put it back on.
[143:42.20]Put it back on.
[143:47.08]Okay, I think... Bye, Bruce.
[144:11.08]Okay.
[144:11.42]Why is this music playing?
[144:16.75]Why is this a Tarantino movie?
[144:19.69]What's the point of the music?
[144:23.55]Is that him?
[144:24.25]Is that a recording of him playing this?
[144:30.47]Okay.
[144:38.18]Back out we go.
[144:40.47]After I search the area.
[144:52.17]I can still hear the music.
[144:55.00]It's a really nice recording you have there.
[144:58.66]Go down.
[144:59.26]Alright, this is where I fucked up before.
[145:01.06]I hear gunshots.
[145:06.40]I'm locked and loaded.
[145:15.11]Good to go.
[145:15.49]Anything else down here?
[145:16.41]I can still hear the music.
[145:21.05]No, there's just a bunch of radiation down here.
[145:22.59]Glad I'm stepping in it.
[145:24.61]Like a smart fucking moron.
[145:30.54]Like I'm still alive?
[145:32.20]No.
[145:36.60]Got anything on you?
[145:39.21]Doesn't seem like it.
[145:45.23]Why is this music still playing?
[145:47.46]Do I have to find the music?
[145:57.04]Can I take his mask?
[146:06.77]No.
[146:13.92]Okay, I'm going to run out of air again.
[146:16.96]What have I got for air?
[146:18.98]Five minutes?
[146:21.69]Okay, I don't think I have... No, I don't have five minutes.
[146:23.93]What's going on with my guy?
[146:26.93]I need to learn how to read this.
[146:29.89]Five minutes.
[146:31.75]That's not... It says five minutes again.
[146:33.89]It still says five minutes.
[146:34.99]I'm not doing that correctly.
[146:54.24]Over here.
[146:54.92]Watch out for the aliens.
[146:57.38]I can't read a clock hand.
[146:59.26]I mean, I can read a clock hand, but... What?
[147:03.02]What am I looking at here?
[147:04.98]It says 10 o'clock.
[147:07.90]Is this a watch?
[147:10.15]Oh, shit!
[147:16.33]Glad you made it.
[147:17.57]Glad you were a goner.
[147:18.67]Glad, uh... That's okay.
[147:21.25]We are almost there.
[147:22.59]Just one quartet left.
[147:31.27]Is this a watch?
[147:33.71]That's a watch!
[147:35.91]It's always 10 o'clock.
[147:45.91]Where?
[147:48.57]Oh yeah, right there.
[147:51.30]How do we kill the first gremlin you see in Gremlins 1?
[147:57.34]It's the green hand.
[148:06.19]It's the orange bar.
[148:07.19]Right now it's almost at zero, right?
[148:11.49]I didn't even... Folks, there was no opportunity for me to know what the fuck was just happening.
[148:17.75]Sorry about that, folks.
[148:19.46]Folks.
[148:19.82]Folks.
[148:29.10]I took the fucking mask off.
[148:37.78]You just fucking take care.
[148:38.78]I'm gonna breathe to death right here.
[148:41.05]This is where I breathe to death.
[148:42.43]I have no gas.
[148:49.03]I'm dead.
[148:51.03]I'm gonna die.
[148:57.22]How long can I stay alive out here?
[149:03.02]I can't put it on.
[149:05.51]I can't put my mask back on.
[149:16.97]If you're out of... I can't put it back on.
[149:23.66]I'm out of filters.
[149:28.01]I have to just take care of this, like, now.
[149:29.45]I don't have any filters.
[149:30.97]Is there any filters anywhere, like, around here?
[149:33.14]Why the fuck would there be?
[149:33.94]Just don't... I'm just gonna sit still and shoot.
[149:43.71]Just don't move.
[149:50.93]Yeah, don't eat yellow snow.
[149:52.23]I know, it's funny.
[150:02.50]What if I just don't move?
[150:09.89]Now I'm dead.
[150:10.39]I'm so dead.
[150:27.26]Can I heal or anything?
[150:28.28]No.
[150:29.10]Nah, it's over.
[150:30.62]I'm dead.
[150:35.99]I deserve this for spending my money on a scope.
[150:41.99]I didn't even understand like what the core concepts of the game were.
[150:45.53]I'm gonna take it off.
[150:47.27]I'm gonna put it on right before I suffocate.
[150:49.84]And then do it again.
[151:01.24]All right, put it on.
[151:03.70]One, two, three, take it off.
[151:09.32]Okay, and put it on.
[151:21.57]One, two, take it off.
[151:34.57]Run!
[151:36.54]Take it up.
[151:48.30]Puppet.
[151:52.21]Put the mask on.
[151:52.93]Put the mask on.
[151:53.53]Alright, let's go.
[151:57.13]Let's go.
[151:57.39]Let's go.
[151:57.67]Get out of there!
[152:02.81]No!
[152:10.41]Come on.
[152:44.75]Reload this now so I don't have to do it.
[152:49.31]I do know the strat.
[152:50.27]Why are these not fucking reloaded?
[153:17.25]do I have to do this calm down I calm the down calm down all right can we go go can we go
[153:46.56]They're here.
[153:48.24]Let's go.
[153:48.72]Hightail it back.
[153:49.24]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[153:53.65]Let's go.
[153:53.87]All right, I made it.
[153:56.23]Nice.
[153:56.41]All right.
[153:58.33]Now... Let me breathe out of your mask for a second, dude.
[154:05.80]Please.
[154:09.97]Let me, like, okay, well, you know when you're underwater, and, like, there's only one scuba tank, and I don't have any air in my tank left, but you have half a tank?
[154:19.01]You come over to me, and you go... And then you put it back, and we keep going.
[154:29.16]Listen carefully.
[154:30.44]The bandits control this station.
[154:32.32]We need to move quietly and take a look around.
[154:34.34]No gas mask, right?
[154:35.14]If you don't see my friends, we get the hell out of here.
[154:40.29]Does he have a gas mask on?
[154:43.75]No, he's not wearing his mask.
[154:44.67]Thank God.
[154:45.17]Oh, I'm so happy that I don't have to... I'm good.
[154:56.14]I just got past the worst part of the game.
[154:57.80]What do you mean?
[155:13.71]Well, I got all of his stuff now.
[155:20.22]I was just trying to throw a grenade.
[155:30.34]I was just desperately trying to do it.
[155:33.42]Take me to your leader.
[155:39.58]Where else would you like to go?
[155:43.80]Okay, that's enough.
[155:47.10]You seeing this ship?
[155:49.43]Move it.
[155:50.31]We'll finish this later.
[155:52.09]Move it!
[156:12.54]Why do I have that thing?
[156:19.20]Okay.
[156:26.06]Well, now I have this.
[156:28.66]Thanks for the AK.
[156:32.22]And no gas mask, but that's okay.
[156:34.51]Nothing else, right?
[157:02.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[157:03.78]You all know it wasn't going to happen.
[157:04.92]We're fine.
[157:07.16]No, I want this.
[157:13.87]Put that back on.
[157:19.03]Take the AK and the pump gun.
[157:21.37]I don't have any bullets for the pump gun.
[157:23.41]And plus, I have too much money in that thing.
[157:30.30]No, I don't...
[157:32.95]I need to like sell the scope on this.
[157:34.39]There's only... There's two ways to go.
[157:37.36]I can go this way too.
[157:43.22]Where... What happened?
[157:52.14]What happened?
[157:54.73]Are they shooting at somebody else?
[158:00.54]They're shooting at each other right now.
[158:01.98]No, they're shooting at me.
[158:02.62]They're shooting at me.
[158:19.47]Somebody said use throwing knives.
[158:28.04]I'm fine.
[158:53.91]What happened to that guy?
[158:59.23]Did that guy die from my throwing knife?
[159:15.31]What happened?
[159:22.13]I didn't want to hit Q, I wanted to hit fucking Tab.
[159:25.47]Tab is right fucking next to Q. Why do I... See that... Are they walking into the cans and it's killing them?
[159:53.02]Is that what the fuck is happening right now?
[160:07.55]Are you fucking kidding me?
[160:12.87]Why am I invisible?
[160:13.77]What?
[160:25.79]I don't... We gotta move.
[160:30.81]What if I just get... It really is home alone.
[160:37.00]It really is home alone.
[160:38.66]Alright, let's do this.
[160:44.98]Let's do this over.
[160:47.83]It actually is home alone.
[160:49.91]That's why they're dying.
[160:55.67]You know what?
[160:56.09]Fuck it.
[160:56.85]Let's just get over there.
[160:58.73]Watch this shit.
[161:10.08]Watch this.
[161:15.14]Come on.
[161:16.12]Somebody trip it.
[161:17.66]I want to watch somebody... I want to watch that happen to somebody.
[161:30.84]And my light is off.
[161:38.48]Okay, here we go.
[161:41.24]I need to go straight ahead, but that ain't gonna happen with that many people there.
[161:44.00]I gotta turn these lights off.
[161:48.04]Okay.
[161:50.17]So far, so good.
[161:51.03]Good thing I got the scope.
[161:53.75]Yikes.
[161:57.31]Any people?
[161:57.71]I got a guy over there.
[161:58.81]Do I have that throwing knife?
[162:00.89]No, I don't.
[162:01.31]I just have incendiary grenades.
[162:06.97]Why would you shoot immediately?
[162:13.08]Can I hide here?
[162:24.85]I'm in a fourth grade spot, but I think the fourth grade spot is going to work.
[162:28.16]No, it isn't.
[162:45.95]I'm so dead.
[162:54.01]Why did that guy go like this?
[162:59.15]Who put a katana through that guy's chest?
[163:02.90]He's like, oh shit.
[163:11.16]Great stealth.
[163:12.64]I don't know if this is a me problem.
[163:19.20]Where am I supposed to stealth?
[163:22.32]I can't even peek.
[163:23.12]Can you peek corners?
[163:31.85]They're killing each other.
[163:33.19]Okay, well that makes sense.
[163:36.79]What do you mean, who the fuck is that?
[163:40.38]Why can they see me?
[163:41.46]It's almost like they're wearing things that are killing them on their chest.
[163:49.00]Oh, god damn it.
[163:50.08]Of course, here he comes.
[163:50.82]I'm going for a knife.
[163:59.55]Where is this guy?
[164:00.09]The guy disappeared.
[164:01.75]The guy disappeared.
[164:02.47]That guy did a magic trick.
[164:03.69]He's not here.
[164:04.65]Which way did he go?
[164:22.15]You just, you can't hear me turn that off.
[164:37.42]There's very clearly somebody here.
[164:38.82]Which way is he gonna go this way?
[164:44.38]That guy said he's taking too many shrooms?
[164:49.28]Got it.
[164:50.66]There is a backstab.
[164:54.06]I didn't know if there was.
[164:54.92]Can I drag the body?
[165:02.21]Ah, must be on too many mushrooms.
[165:04.87]Oh, fuck.
[165:06.91]This guy watching TV?
[165:12.29]Shit, don't look over here.
[165:17.76]Oh, shit.
[165:24.23]So far so good.
[165:26.27]Now where's the save button?
[165:40.14]He shed out a gun.
[165:42.66]How do I get by these guys?
[165:47.91]They're just staring down here.
[165:50.63]It's almost like, is there a way to wrap around?
[165:52.45]There's like two guys here.
[165:53.45]I'll go this way for a second.
[165:57.87]Turn off the lanterns.
[165:59.91]I'm going all darkness.
[166:11.42]Too many shrooms.
[166:14.28]You guys are doing a lot of drugs.
[166:21.03]I think there's a guy in here, right?
[166:22.29]Or down here?
[166:22.69]I can't wait for the Metro 2033 shpee joke.
[166:36.59]What are you talking about?
[166:39.35]What are you doing?
[166:40.19]I forgot.
[166:42.37]Okay, we're good.
[166:51.15]I've done too many things correctly to fucking blow this.
[166:58.39]We're going lantern to lantern.
[167:07.86]How many people are up there?
[167:14.52]Don't die to the trap.
[167:20.37]Good thing somebody just said that because I was about to walk right down that thing.
[167:25.15]I was about to get hit right in the face by that and blow everything.
[167:29.26]Save the game?
[167:29.88]I can't.
[167:30.36]There is no save the game.
[167:31.68]It does it automatically.
[167:32.38]I mean, I guess I could go 1-2 right now.
[167:37.49]That's too loud.
[167:39.69]No.
[167:42.05]No, take this off.
[167:44.85]Is he coming down here?
[167:52.40]F5 is a quicksave?
[167:53.98]No, it ain't.
[167:56.06]You just lied to me.
[167:57.48]You just lied to me.
[168:12.15]How did that miss?
[168:14.65]How did I miss him?
[168:16.29]It went right by his face.
[168:19.79]Yeah, too many shrooms.
[168:24.61]Actually, that's good.
[168:30.35]Shit.
[168:30.83]Oh, shit.
[168:32.23]You're doing too many drugs, dude.
[168:33.71]Too many shrooms.
[168:34.61]Oh, fuck.
[168:43.06]Where's the other guy?
[168:56.43]Oh, God damn it.
[169:00.69]No!
[169:32.27]I'm so disappointed.
[169:34.25]Are you still alive?
[169:36.13]What's this guy doing?
[169:37.85]What is going on right now?
[169:41.45]What's wrong with this guy?
[169:46.76]Alright.
[169:50.90]We're good.
[169:55.46]What?
[169:58.84]I don't have to even do anything.
[170:01.87]If I just run around enough, they'll do it to themselves.
[170:13.91]Where?
[170:14.37]Where?
[170:21.72]Give me his ladle.
[170:22.32]Give me his ladle!
[170:37.83]Take, take, take, take it all.
[170:38.97]Take, take, take, take, take.
[170:40.90]Take it.
[170:41.40]Take it all.
[170:49.82]Oh, fuck.
[170:55.49]Damn, I can't believe it.
[171:23.46]Knife, good.
[171:26.03]Couple knives.
[171:27.73]Make sure they're on.
[171:33.19]Anything else in here?
[171:33.83]I don't think so.
[171:35.25]We're good.
[171:43.44]He just front flipped into me and died.
[171:53.11]Okay, let's keep going.
[171:59.29]Who cares if they can see the light?
[172:06.52]Don't let him shoot.
[172:07.75]Did he throw it?
[172:08.33]He did throw it!
[172:10.15]God damn it!
[172:33.99]Why would you check to see me?
[172:35.83]Because he put his hand up and I shot him and then it was over here.
[172:39.61]The animation didn't even happen.
[172:40.97]He didn't even get to... It's time to go.
[172:45.23]Here we go.
[173:04.41]Time to go!
[173:04.83]Hey, what the fuck was that?
[173:23.56]Reload!
[173:23.74]Got him, Pete!
[173:24.74]Surround him!
[173:25.04]I'ma fuck it around.
[173:25.50]Play it in normal.
[173:26.44]No, I'm... I had an opportunity.
[173:28.14]I just, like, watched the stupid fucking thing come all the way down.
[173:35.41]I'll get it.
[173:36.17]Just, I'm not gonna dick around this time, I swear to God.
[173:38.49]We're going fucking straight up, like, FPS.
[173:41.18]FPS ability right here.
[173:55.31]Ha ha ha!
[174:53.75]What the fuck?
[175:43.66]Why is there a grenade?
[175:45.02]Let's look for the bitch.
[176:22.23]That guy exploded.
[176:23.03]That guy's limbs came out.
[176:24.25]Okay, they're dying.
[176:27.66]Let's go.
[176:36.58]Okay.
[176:50.69]How did they even know?
[176:51.49]How did they even see?
[176:57.56]Where are you shooting from?
[176:58.70]Oh, the fucking light.
[177:48.31]Where is this guy?
[177:49.93]Is he up top?
[178:02.56]He's got a sniper rifle or something.
[178:13.81]Eat shit.
[178:17.03]Ready, and three, two, one, go!
[178:37.12]What's that a trigger for?
[178:40.66]Monsters.
[178:41.16]Okay, there's monsters in here now?
[178:46.60]I'm going to go in here.
[178:48.57]Can I open this door?
[178:51.09]Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.
[178:52.17]They're going to get up.
[178:54.51]The monster's going to get up.
[178:56.91]Right?
[178:57.39]I mean, they have to.
[178:58.61]Why else would they be in here like this?
[179:02.35]What is that?
[179:06.07]Oh, that's new.
[179:14.21]What is this thing?
[179:24.31]Okay.
[179:26.05]Pretty nice.
[179:26.85]I guess I'm gonna have to take it.
[179:31.67]Turn this off.
[179:39.79]Pretty good.
[179:40.17]Alright, what- I gotta disable that shit.
[179:45.17]Okay, it was a bomb.
[179:49.31]Where to?
[179:50.85]Down?
[179:56.93]Going down.
[179:58.93]No, gas.
[180:01.07]Put on your mask.
[180:03.49]No, put on your mask, dude.
[180:05.43]Put on your fucking mask.
[180:07.95]I can't put on my mask.
[180:08.99]What is that thing?
[180:09.77]What is that thing down there?
[180:12.97]It's ammo.
[180:13.53]Just get it.
[180:14.61]Just pick it all up and go.
[180:20.21]Go, get up, get up.
[180:24.81]Climb the ladder.
[180:27.87]No fucking way I was going to say they're not going to do that shit to me right now.
[180:33.49]Straight ahead.
[180:35.25]And just like that, we finally get to leave.
[180:39.63]Why would you take that long to shoot him?
[180:57.61]You had so much time to shoot him.
[181:08.54]You can keep your weapon down, young man.
[181:11.42]Look at new character.
[181:12.26]What was that?
[181:15.23]What is making this noise?
[181:16.25]What's with the bang?
[181:17.25]Oh, they're trying to break in the door.
[181:18.36]Food?
[181:44.61]I don't know if that did, but I guess, okay.
[181:48.05]All right, I will follow you, but first let me just look in the diary.
[181:51.11]Let's open up our, is there a knife in there?
[181:53.75]There is, but I can't take it.
[181:57.11]Random shit on the table.
[181:58.43]Pencils, pens, notebooks.
[182:02.55]Let's go.
[182:06.95]Use the Estes soup.
[182:09.47]Drink the Estes soup.
[182:19.55]Jerma seems irritated.
[182:20.85]No, I'm not irritated.
[182:23.15]I'm fine.
[182:28.25]I'm good to go.
[182:32.25]So where to now?
[182:39.99]Caution.
[182:41.21]High voltage.
[182:45.36]Mission failure.
[182:46.00]Am I enjoying the game?
[182:55.31]The game actually is pretty fun.
[182:57.85]This difficulty is hard, but it's not like impossible.
[183:02.03]It's... It's fun.
[183:24.46]What?
[183:26.87]I listened to the music for too long and it fucking hurt me?
[183:33.17]He's like, whoa, man, what did I tell you?
[183:35.35]I told you not to do that shit.
[183:41.61]Some say it's the voice of the tunnels.
[183:44.52]No reaction, I mean.
[183:45.56]To be a form of psychic influence.
[183:50.08]I had an internal reaction.
[183:51.20]I was like, whoa.
[183:52.98]I know this tunnel.
[183:57.91]I know what he's done.
[184:01.34]Oh god.
[184:02.44]Not another tunnel.
[184:04.10]With monsters and zombies.
[184:07.06]They're all going to charge at us.
[184:08.36]What is that?
[184:08.94]It's just a shotgun.
[184:15.81]Throw this thing to trash.
[184:20.65]Is that not reloaded?
[184:24.54]We'll listen to the pipes again.
[184:26.76]Okay, fine.
[184:34.14]It's not happening again.
[184:34.86]No, there's one of the things.
[184:36.45]Okay.
[184:56.54]I still don't have... I need to go back to the market.
[185:01.10]Am I going to need to use my gas mask again?
[185:03.88]Because I'm kind of way down in the no man's land right now.
[185:09.00]What is it?
[185:09.32]Don't... I just wasted two bullets.
[185:17.18]Great.
[185:21.51]Did he actually react to me shooting him though?
[185:30.41]Just a couple of skulls.
[185:36.95]I'm not afraid of spiders.
[185:45.87]How come you're not helping me do this?
[185:47.12]Are you going to do anything about this, or what?
[185:58.10]Oh, I finally...
[186:03.73]Not a use for the lighter.
[186:04.69]I'm going to have to put the mask on.
[186:10.46]I cannot complete the game.
[186:12.30]I'm going to keep the lighter out.
[186:21.62]Chicken!
[186:31.71]Chicken!
[186:35.18]That was close.
[186:40.36]Where's the train?
[186:41.86]I like the atmosphere of this game.
[186:43.46]Feels like...
[187:04.40]Feels like a fully complete experience.
[187:07.88]They don't put you too long in one spot.
[187:09.78]They don't, you know, like down in the tunnels the whole game.
[187:11.90]You're not outside in like the blurry, eye-blearing snow.
[187:16.80]They switch it up on you a little bit.
[187:17.96]I like it.
[187:22.28]Freeze and look forward.
[187:27.00]A battle raged here long ago.
[187:30.28]The Defender still manned their stations.
[187:33.72]So throw a grenade.
[187:35.16]So you're saying throw a grenade down.
[187:41.12]Okay, I'm following.
[187:45.61]No, he's saying a prayer.
[187:46.61]The way is shut.
[188:13.11]Oh, damn it.
[188:16.21]I was a little too late.
[188:17.45]Everyone's praying in the chat.
[188:23.90]Hey, can I get some praise in the chat, please?
[188:28.68]Wasted a grenade.
[188:31.64]Did I waste a grenade, or was that a perfectly good use of a grenade?
[188:35.34]Hold on.
[188:35.96]I got it.
[188:47.52]This game just started to get very deep on me here.
[188:53.06]Free stuff!
[188:58.20]What else you got in here?
[188:58.84]I need a compressor.
[189:05.69]I need a compressor.
[189:17.47]Oh no, you've rustled some cans.
[189:19.89]Here they come.
[189:20.83]Here comes the horde.
[189:23.41]Speaking of the horde, you know what game's coming out soon that I can't wait to play?
[189:26.07]That I'm really actually excited for?
[189:29.03]It's Vermintide 2.
[189:30.21]That looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.
[189:34.18]And it's coming out soon, too.
[189:35.82]It's now coming out at the end of the next year.
[189:38.66]It's coming out soon.
[189:46.16]Something around the corner?
[189:52.76]Oh, our ecto reader can hear them.
[189:59.88]Why are they on fire?
[190:07.74]Do I have fire bullets?
[190:09.22]What's going on with this?
[190:16.24]What he meant to say is he can't wait for Metro Exodus.
[190:20.43]That would probably be cool too.
[190:23.65]Hold on.
[190:24.21]Bodies and shit.
[190:25.91]Put this down.
[190:30.65]I'm like in danger.
[190:31.47]Okay, let's go.
[190:37.41]You're using military ammo.
[190:42.35]How do I change the ammo to not being the crazy ammo?
[190:49.74]Holding R is different ammo.
[190:54.47]What just happened?
[191:00.77]I'd like to go down here Hold R That clip looks exactly the same R
[191:30.53]Hold left mouse button.
[191:33.49]Why do you not have a HUD?
[191:34.27]Because I'm playing on the ranger difficulty.
[191:40.76]He has to hold left mouse button.
[191:44.60]Yeah, let me hold left mouse button.
[191:45.96]That'll fix it.
[191:52.63]You can feel it coming, I see.
[191:54.37]That's a rare talent.
[191:55.37]You should use it.
[191:56.89]Don't move now.
[191:58.76]Don't move.
[192:04.46]Why?
[192:06.04]Why are we not moving?
[192:06.74]Is something in here?
[192:13.85]Let's go.
[192:14.11]What are you talking about?
[192:15.21]Don't move.
[192:16.23]What do you mean don't?
[192:17.09]I thought the game just broke.
[192:18.73]Why do you want me to not move?
[192:22.32]Oh, God.
[192:22.88]It's like a lightning enemy.
[192:24.37]I can smell you.
[192:27.69]I can smell your breath.
[192:28.89]Don't move.
[192:36.76]Man, come on.
[192:37.24]No photos.
[192:41.08]Can we move yet?
[192:45.50]Of course, this is an anomaly.
[192:50.88]Of course they put anomalies in this game.
[192:56.82]Huh?
[193:07.01]So hold on.
[193:08.17]So they made...
[193:15.77]They made Metro and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[193:21.93]So this is just a more FPS, not RPG.
[193:26.69]Well, I mean, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[193:27.89]isn't FPS.
[193:30.65]This is more like an action-oriented S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[193:33.37]Like a full-on action FPS game.
[193:37.50]I guess.
[193:37.96]I don't know.
[193:39.24]It's a different dev.
[193:40.96]The devs split off.
[193:42.14]I see.
[193:44.78]So is there a... So we got Stalker.
[193:50.22]Is this Stalker Cash?
[193:52.26]Which one is which?
[193:53.10]Is it like infighting between the two?
[193:55.60]Do people think one's better than the other?
[193:57.67]Ah, shit.
[194:03.01]What?
[194:03.17]Oh, great.
[194:07.55]Get ready.
[194:08.67]The beasts come again.
[194:11.91]They respect each other.
[194:12.79]Okay, let's go.
[194:22.49]Why would I even turn that on?
[194:26.41]Can the NPC colleagues die?
[194:28.45]I don't know why I just called it a colleague.
[194:32.58]Because, like, let him just do all the work.
[194:40.66]That's too close.
[194:41.40]Too close!
[194:52.23]That's still the currency ammo.
[194:53.41]God damn it!
[195:06.78]Any more behind us?
[195:09.42]So I just don't have any more ammo left on that.
[195:10.74]Okay.
[195:13.40]Stop shooting money.
[195:14.18]I just wanted to test.
[195:14.78]I just didn't know if it's still shooting the right one.
[195:17.20]Or the bad one.
[195:18.69]There's no need to interfere.
[195:20.51]We got another wave, another horde coming.
[195:23.15]Turn around, dude.
[195:25.03]We have a problem here.
[195:25.89]I didn't do that.
[195:26.43]He did.
[195:30.40]What is this bright-ass light?
[195:33.12]I thought we're not supposed to move here.
[195:34.60]All right.
[195:38.10]Well, let's go.
[195:40.98]So that's how it goes.
[195:41.80]Yeah.
[195:45.30]Ammo coin.
[195:46.52]Yeah.
[195:46.82]Let's like mine some fucking stalker ammo.
[195:50.11]No, this isn't stalker.
[195:50.89]Some metro ammo coin.
[195:58.49]Ooh, secret.
[195:59.46]10 IQ streamer.
[196:06.32]Deaf streamer.
[196:09.06]What are you guys talking about?
[196:12.76]overused joke.
[196:13.62]Oh, I'm overusing that like crazy.
[196:15.50]I'm not going to be able to make that joke in like fucking six months because the whole thing's coming down.
[196:21.59]You know what I mean?
[196:22.17]I'm going to use as many Bitcoin cryptocurrency jokes as I can because in 2019, that whole thing is coming down.
[196:29.54]So...
[196:44.50]I'm just kidding, it's a joke, it's a joke.
[196:49.16]You have found one secret cache in the whole game.
[196:52.67]It's all right, we're gonna take the lawn mower to his basement to figure it out.
[196:58.17]Yeah.
[197:01.65]I'm ready for ya.
[197:02.31]Told ya.
[197:08.52]The monster's attacks have been unrelenting.
[197:11.56]Most people have abandoned the station.
[197:13.46]The unfortunate few who remain have nowhere else to go.
[197:18.60]Oh no, I got some beeps.
[197:19.43]Okay.
[197:19.99]His name is Khan.
[197:29.93]German police play stalker eventually.
[197:34.82]I still have the other two to play as well.
[197:37.00]There's so much in those games.
[197:40.95]Those games are... They require a lot of attention, don't they?
[197:44.85]Oh.
[197:45.55]Whoops.
[197:52.29]That's not going to do anything, is it?
[197:55.12]Please don't do something.
[197:55.76]Please don't do it.
[197:57.00]Sorry.
[197:57.30]It's just a firework.
[197:58.40]Hey.
[198:04.23]Give me his Diablo 2 Hephaestus's Hammer unique item that you use at level 5.
[198:08.63]Right here.
[198:09.41]Right here.
[198:09.83]No?
[198:09.97]You know what?
[198:10.93]Okay.
[198:11.81]You don't?
[198:12.23]You sure?
[198:12.67]Okay.
[198:24.67]Move it into the left tunnel as far as you can, then run for it.
[198:28.51]The explosion will be massive.
[198:30.75]As for the crossing, it's already been buried once.
[198:33.45]That looks like the Nosalises have dug through the cave in.
[198:36.87]There was an area close by.
[198:38.51]It must have been left open.
[198:40.17]Try locking or collapsing it.
[198:42.43]I'll stay here with the survivors.
[198:43.97]Hey, buddy, you got a face like a catcher's mitt.
[198:46.08]You all right?
[198:46.94]What am I going?
[198:52.72]Can I buy something from any of you guys?
[198:56.60]No, I'll just take it.
[198:57.40]That's fine.
[199:07.46]Okay.
[199:10.28]Go.
[199:10.86]Get him.
[199:13.18]He needs to go forward.
[199:14.15]Here we go.
[199:17.55]I'm just going to the objective.
[199:25.59]I don't even need the fucking ADR, you know what I mean?
[199:35.77]Boom.
[199:36.39]Nope.
[199:44.50]Gasoline.
[199:46.56]That's what we're looking for, right?
[199:50.80]Got it.
[200:02.18]Oh, come on!
[200:12.70]Where'd that guy go with the cheese?
[200:14.46]There was a guy with an extra cheese that I could have taken.
[200:16.14]Where the fuck is he?
[200:18.87]Where's the extra cheese?
[200:19.57]The guy had an extra cheese.
[200:21.11]There it is.
[200:26.93]Now what?
[200:28.97]Across the way.
[200:30.75]And here?
[200:32.85]Nope.
[200:34.69]What's going on with my screen?
[200:44.47]Nothing else.
[200:45.19]Where else am I going?
[200:47.29]You want me to go this way?
[200:50.21]I guess I'm going this way.
[200:52.75]No ghost rain.
[201:27.48]Go!
[201:31.70]Dump the gasoline, burn it.
[201:33.05]Alright.
[201:36.95]Is this a bomb?
[201:38.67]It is.
[201:49.01]Kaboom!
[201:54.77]Blow the debris.
[201:56.46]Why is it not exploding?
[201:57.36]Why is it not exploding?
[201:58.42]Okay.
[202:00.02]Everything's fine.
[202:21.60]I didn't know that was going to be like a nuclear blast.
[202:24.53]I thought this would be far enough away.
[202:25.77]It's a video game.
[202:26.65]Am I far enough away now?
[202:34.15]Yes.
[202:41.06]Okay.
[202:42.20]Now we go back in a tunnel.
[202:46.16]Yeah, the explosion will be huge.
[202:48.56]They say that in every game.
[202:52.90]That's like, oh, watch out, the explosion's going to be fucking massive, mate.
[202:57.37]It's like, it's always just like a little dicky thing and they put like a little Unity explosion in.
[203:01.05]This game was made in Unity.
[203:09.17]I did it!
[203:14.45]Now what?
[203:18.68]There's more.
[203:19.58]Okay.
[203:28.05]Is there somebody?
[203:28.55]What's going on over there?
[203:30.07]No.
[203:30.41]Okay.
[203:38.61]Two bombs.
[203:41.19]Is that actually what's going on?
[203:42.56]Do I actually need to do two bombs?
[203:46.68]No.
[203:46.80]There's stairs over here.
[203:47.60]I gotta go up these stairs.
[203:50.12]There actually might be two bombs.
[203:52.10]I would not be surprised.
[203:59.16]Oh, God damn it!
[204:03.24]Shoot them!
[204:03.94]Shoot them!
[204:04.30]They're behind me!
[204:05.08]I got some guys behind me, please!
[204:07.44]Fellas!
[204:08.56]Fellas!
[204:14.18]Why are you two not doing anything?
[204:16.26]Attack!
[204:22.62]Not actually fucking kidding me.
[204:24.28]Are you serious?
[204:27.14]Shoot him in the head!
[204:29.47]Are you people fucking stupid?
[204:46.27]Why do I have to go alone?
[204:48.83]That seems so unfair.
[205:06.25]All four of their backs are turned.
[205:08.89]All four of them.
[205:36.00]Why are you hiding there?
[205:36.94]Fuck off!
[205:42.80]What do I gotta do here?
[205:48.40]What does it want me to do?
[205:51.66]Is it gonna blow the tunnel?
[205:52.76]Alright, we're fine.
[206:03.02]Let's go.
[206:08.70]This game was made in Game Maker Pro.
[206:11.38]What does it say?
[206:12.28]The Witcher 3 was made in Unity.
[206:13.04]Witcher 3 was made in Unity.
[206:14.12]He just threw a grenade down behind him.
[206:30.77]The Smithy is an independent station, so it should be no problem.
[206:34.87]But the Reds... I gotta sell a lot of shit.
[206:37.31]They are building a new society, complete with all the lovely police state bonuses, like people informing on their neighbors.
[206:45.84]The Smithy look for an acquaintance of mine.
[206:49.38]Andrew, the blacksmith.
[206:51.44]Mention my name.
[206:52.88]He'll give you a hand.
[207:02.48]Alright.
[207:02.92]I don't know what the point of that was.
[207:17.61]Disrespect the fucking shrine.
[207:20.23]Disrespect the shrine.
[207:21.41]Blow out all the candles.
[207:22.31]Disrespect everything.
[207:24.51]This is like a weird cult in here.
[207:26.95]This is where the demons are coming from.
[207:36.79]Why are you not blowing these out?
[207:37.59]This is more like they're summoning Satan.
[207:45.29]Doom prequel.
[207:46.19]I know, right?
[207:46.71]This is like the room where all the aliens come from.
[207:49.28]I've seen aliens.
[207:57.84]Wait a minute.
[208:00.94]Oh, no, these are not like demon.
[208:02.42]This is not like a demon cult.
[208:03.80]All right, come on.
[208:04.50]Give me a break here.
[208:06.27]Every time I'm in a video game, I've ever gone to a place where there's a bunch of candles in a room with, like, music playing in the background.
[208:12.77]It's been a demon shrine.
[208:14.63]So... I'm sorry about that.
[208:19.01]That wasn't cool.
[208:20.69]I thought it was a demon shrine. ...
[208:36.40]They're using you as a sacrifice to power the... I just went downstairs.
[208:40.14]It would make sense.
[208:41.72]That would make some sense.

[209:41.55]Thanks for the entrance.
[209:49.10]Careful, kid.
[209:50.48]Our free station is under the watchful eye of the Reds.
[209:54.50]Paranoia is a new game in town, so keep yourself below the radar.
[209:57.69]You understand?
[209:59.99]You understand?
[210:00.43]I think I just had an American southern accent.

[211:01.41]Why is he standing there?
[211:13.58]Follow me!
[211:15.08]Come follow me, guy!
[211:16.38]I want to sell something first.
[211:22.52]I don't think I can.
[211:25.02]That was not the same guy.
[211:26.12]Yes, it was.
[211:26.68]Hold on.
[211:27.36]That wasn't the same guy.
[211:29.68]Yes, it was.
[211:31.32]Wrong, dude.
[211:32.02]That's the same guy.
[211:33.36]That's the same fucking bald hitman looking asshole.
[211:46.45]Oh, you got me right in the left part of my thigh.
[211:48.89]Watch.
[211:49.67]There he is.
[211:52.94]Follow me!
[211:56.87]It might have been a different bald guy.
[212:03.07]We're not running that fast.
[212:10.79]I can't do that.
[212:14.59]I'm getting lit the fuck up right now.
[212:18.51]Come on, you gotta give me a break.
[212:19.37]The guy had the same jacket, the same hairstyle, bald...
[212:29.38]Why is this probably a portal?
[212:31.88]This is Portal 2.
[212:32.66]Stop, you punk!
[212:41.18]If there's still a god left in our world, that day, he was with me.
[212:47.55]I had been rescued by Han's friend, Andrew the Blacksmith.
[212:52.63]He would prove to be my ticket out of the communist station.
[212:57.46]But the only way goes through a goddamn battlefield.
[213:00.44]The front line between the Reich and the Reds.
[213:03.50]You'll need a disguise.
[213:05.18]Take these overalls, put them over your clothes.
[213:07.45]Take these overalls.
[213:09.75]A Russian disguise.
[213:11.03]A pair of denim on your bottom half of your body.
[213:15.21]Why are you guys doing this?
[213:16.23]Why are we doing this?
[213:17.21]Once the troop train has passed the roadblocks, you're on your own.
[213:35.03]Alright, past the 22X.
[213:46.52]Up, up, down, down, left, right, B, A, start.
[213:50.34]Alright, gotta go past the 22X, and then... Once I get there... Maybe I can buy a few things.
[213:58.94]Oh, we're not supposed to be seen together?
[214:01.60]Is that what's going on?
[214:02.52]Everyone was just looking at me.
[214:10.64]Oh, he's trying to jump on his back.
[214:12.48]Alright, I want to buy and sell.
[214:17.60]Buy and sell.
[214:18.14]I think it's this way.
[214:19.42]I have 57 twine twacks, so... First aid.
[214:21.15]I don't know.
[214:21.71]I don't need medkits.
[214:35.79]Secondary.
[214:37.81]I don't need this shit.
[214:38.57]I already have enough.
[214:39.91]Get out of my life.
[214:41.11]What about you?

[215:06.81]Filters.
[215:07.23]Where do I buy filters from?
[215:08.61]Who sells filters?
[215:09.84]You?
[215:17.94]This fucking asshole does not sell filters.
[215:22.80]This is Ranger.
[215:26.15]He can't buy filters.
[215:29.33]Wait, I can't buy filters?
[215:34.71]This first guy right here.
[215:37.82]I don't have filters.
[215:38.46]What are you talking about?
[215:43.44]Fight.
[215:43.64]We're going to fight.
[215:50.00]No, they're just play fighting.
[215:55.64]I can't buy filters at this station.
[215:59.32]Oh, well, that's annoying.
[216:01.90]What time is it?
[216:03.56]I got to get prepared for tomorrow.

[217:08.21]Fuck it.
[217:08.61]I'm just kidding.
[217:09.85]They might just stay up there.
[217:11.67]I might keep this room decorated like Christmas for like six months.
[217:20.34]It should be a lot of fun though.
[217:21.34]We're going to like play Christmas music.
[217:24.75]Going to have a few drinks.
[217:27.54]a tree.
[217:28.32]It's going to be super fun.
[217:29.53]It's going to be super like family friendly.
[217:32.55]You know?
[217:32.79]That's what I'm talking about.
[217:33.57]We're all about family friendly tomorrow night.
[217:43.04]Yeah.
[217:43.40]Eternal Christmas.
[217:46.84]Just get a real get a real tree.
[217:49.82]I wanted one.
[217:51.22]It was going to be like bent and fucked up on the top there so I wouldn't be able to do it.
[217:57.89]Family friendly.
[218:00.91]So get it out now.
[218:03.53]This guy does not sell filters.
[218:07.46]You can't buy filters here.
[218:10.96]But I actually really think this game is a lot of fun.
[218:13.62]So it's been about four hours, four and a half hours or so.
[218:18.05]When do we start?
[218:18.61]I had to restart the stream.
[218:22.47]But, yeah.
[218:26.64]I'm going to call it a night because I want to prepare.
[218:30.72]Yeah, I streamed for about an hour and 15 minutes before I had to turn it off.
[218:35.83]Yeah, you guys are all going to have fun.
[218:39.99]More like two.
[218:40.81]I've already been streaming for three.
[218:42.91]And I was streaming for an hour before I had to restart the stream.
[218:48.84]The first hour and a half was bullshit.
[218:51.26]It was still live.
[218:52.24]I was still sitting here.
[218:53.14]Yeah, the decoration stream is tomorrow.
[219:01.47]Yeah.
[219:03.07]Like I told you guys before, he's like... Everyone's talking about Santa.
[219:08.17]Like, he's... I'm going to be decorating, like, around him.
[219:12.09]He's going to be sitting here.
[219:14.51]Originally, there was supposed to be... Like, there was going to be a tree here, and I was going to do, like, a second tree.
[219:22.63]But he's kind of in the way.
[219:25.79]Maybe I'll put some stuff on him.
[219:26.81]I don't know.
[219:27.74]I'll make him look a little bit...
[219:30.16]Maybe I'll make him look a little jollier.
[219:33.48]Use him as the tree?
[219:34.82]Maybe I'll wrap some lights around him or something.
[219:36.66]I don't know.
[219:37.00]We'll see.
[219:37.34]It'll be fun.
[219:42.09]But, with that being said, I'm going to... I'm going to call it a night because I am getting kind of tired and I do want to prepare for the stream tomorrow.
[219:52.21]Even though I've said that like four times now.
[219:54.83]You have the same shoes?
[219:55.59]Oh, no.
[219:55.83]These aren't even shoes.
[219:56.64]These are slippers.
[219:57.28]These are the real deal.
[220:01.16]These are like house slippers.
[220:03.52]I like to wear house slippers because they feel comfy.
[220:08.70]Let's move this over here.
[220:10.13]And go from here.
[220:14.09]Move that.
[220:20.23]Yada, yada.
[220:21.47]OK.
[220:23.52]So let's go over some of the bits.
[220:27.10]Thank you for joining me.
[220:27.98]Thank you for sticking around.
[220:29.10]I know that that first like 30 or 40 minutes was kind of a disaster.
[220:34.43]But kind of how it fucking happens on my stream.
[220:38.57]I think I've just accepted the fact that like my stream just always will have problems no matter what happens.
[220:43.83]And like even if I try to set up and try to fix them, it's just going to... It just sucks.
[220:48.65]So...
[220:50.00]um thank you so much for uh putting up with the first like not even true it wasn't even that big of a deal it was just kind of like once we got into um metro it was like frame ready and shitty the disaster artist of twitch tv well all right metro's fun metro's a fun game I'll be going back to it after christmas
[221:19.01]I'll probably finish that and... I want to play Alpha Protocol, too.
[221:23.09]Alpha Protocol seems like a really dumb fucking game that I could have a lot of fun with.
[221:32.08]Tommy Wiseau of Twitch.
[221:33.92]Come on!
[221:35.64]I'm a little more, I think, self-aware than that.
[221:43.15]PsyOps?
[221:43.67]I actually looked up PsyOps.
[221:44.91]That's like a PlayStation 2 game.
[221:47.18]I don't even think I can get that to run on Windows.
[221:49.96]I think it came out for Windows, but I'm not even sure I can get it to run.
[221:52.30]I have to go buy it from Amazon or something.
[221:57.63]Anywho, let's go over the bits from tonight.
[222:02.29]There were a lot.
[222:04.75]There were a lot.
[222:07.33]You know, today we're going to go newest to oldest today.
[222:10.93]We're going to go newest to oldest.
[222:12.77]So that'll make a little bit more sense.
[222:15.03]Thank you.
[222:15.49]If you're just, if you're taking off, thanks for sticking around.
[222:18.01]Much love to you.
[222:18.65]See you tomorrow.
[222:19.97]Tomorrow around 8 p.m.

[222:36.30]But we're going to go newest to oldest tonight.
[222:47.84]The Rebecca Black of Twitch.

[223:25.10]Thank you.
[223:27.22]Depends.
[223:28.29]Some days I think I look all right.
[223:29.85]And some days, some days I have like a dirty fucking mop on my head.
[223:38.08]Then some days I need a haircut.
[223:39.80]And some days, like, half my face gets, like, blocked out so you can't, like, see how fucking ugly I really am.
[223:44.91]You know what I'm saying?
[223:47.99]You think this is fucking not intentional to have, like, this big shadow cast on my face?
[223:52.51]And I have the hair fucking come down like this?
[223:54.17]You know what I mean?
[223:55.67]Well, whatever.
[224:01.13]Someone's coming in the room and... Oh!
[224:03.23]You just got squelched.
[224:08.37]Oh, you actually want to bring him in here?
[224:10.02]Yeah, I wanted to bring him in here so he could say, Merry Christmas.
[224:13.30]What are you wearing?
[224:14.72]I found this.
[224:15.34]It's like a fucking robe.
[224:16.58]Yeah, I think this is yours.

[224:33.48]Oh, here's your boy.
[224:36.71]There he is.
[224:39.03]There's the dog of mine.
[224:41.15]You can't even see him.
[224:44.21]Yeah, it's because your settings are so low.
[224:45.99]Can I hold him?
[224:48.56]Yeah, just take the smelly dog away.
[224:53.58]Wait, do you want him to leave?
[224:56.94]She's like, do you want him to fucking leave?
[225:00.08]No.
[225:01.27]I mean, if you want, do you want me to give you a chair?
[225:04.55]I would give you Santa's, but he's sitting in it right now.
[225:07.57]No, I don't want to sit anywhere that he's been sitting.

[233:02.01]Kaltari, thanks for the 250.
[233:04.59]Since you're definitely 100% going to destroy your office tomorrow.
[233:08.15]And by the way, a little bit of a jab there.
[233:11.52]Office is in quotes.
[233:14.46]Tomorrow, use these bits to buy some paper towels or something.
[233:17.06]I don't know, a charity.
[233:18.90]You guys have this like grand scheme in your brain where I'm going to show you.
[233:25.22]Here's what you guys think is going to happen, right?
[233:27.49]I'm gonna squelch this.
[233:28.81]I'm gonna quell this right now.
[233:31.24]Tree's right here.
[233:32.86]Jerma decorates the tree.
[233:34.38]Oh, and he's got all this shit on it.
[233:35.68]And there's all these plugs and all these cords.
[233:37.96]And he fucking pushes it over and the thing explodes.
[233:41.59]That's not gonna happen.
[233:42.61]The tree's not gonna fucking fall over.
[233:45.13]It's not gonna crash.
[233:46.27]There's not gonna be any, like, dude, I'm working with, that's a glass.
[233:52.76]You can't fuck with glass.
[233:54.10]You can't fuck with... Ornaments will hurt you.
[233:56.87]You will get hurt if you fuck with an ornament.
[234:00.37]I'm not going to trash... This room has seen such awful shit over the last... Just paint and...
[234:07.48]Pissin and then blood.
[234:09.48]No, none of those things have been on the floor.
[234:11.36]I've not Went right to that, but that's not how it's out.
[234:15.38]But whatever there.
[234:16.20]Thanks for the 10 bucks I just like pee over here like in the corner somewhere.
[234:23.90]Oh my god There's been piss and blood, you know, it's not a big deal Thank you though But I don't know what errorless what one of my favorite streams was I
[234:38.27]I like pretty much every stream I do, but sometimes I stop and I'm like, eh, I didn't really like that.
[234:44.91]SwaggyBot, thanks for the $5.
[234:47.73]Just out of surgery today, and I love being able to watch your streams.
[234:50.57]Thank you so much for being amazing.
[234:53.13]Whatever it is, I hope you're recovering nicely, SwaggyBot.
[234:57.73]Whatever kind of surgery you had, I hope you a swift and total recovery.
[235:01.09]So thank you so much for the $5.
[235:03.81]Destroying the office.
[235:06.80]Aegis, the Protector, thanks for the $1.
[235:09.00]I'm still offended that you didn't like Steins Gate.
[235:14.90]You wanna know why I didn't like Steins Gate?
[235:25.35]That's why.
[235:38.84]That's why.
[235:45.84]Anyways, thank you for the $1.
[235:53.10]Into the Metro, thanks for the $1.
[235:54.80]I assume your comment's going to be a Metro.
[235:56.34]Will you be playing Metro Last Light?
[235:57.88]Maybe.
[236:00.78]I was starting to feel that a little bit.
[236:05.53]Near the end there, I was having a lot of...
[236:09.26]having a lot of fun.
[236:10.35]So I could assume that maybe if I'm having like a, what's going on with my lip over here?
[236:18.37]I don't know.
[236:18.83]Like the shadow is casting like my mouth.
[236:21.39]Maybe I'm just like weird looking.
[236:22.50]I don't know.
[236:27.56]Maybe if I still have fun and I want to play it some more.
[236:30.62]But thank you so much.
[236:32.08]We will see.
[236:32.56]And then the 2018, we got
[236:38.58]Exodus?
[236:39.60]What is it called?
[236:41.66]Metro 2038 Extraction Point.
[236:44.38]Can't wait to see it.
[236:46.88]But anyways, I got lost there.
[236:49.45]Like, I got lost.
[236:52.41]I was inside my own brain, lost, searching.
[236:55.29]I have no idea who the fuck I was.
[236:56.89]Absolutely no idea.
[236:58.09]Thank you, though.
[236:59.21]Alto Train, thanks for the $1.50.
[237:01.02]I guess you're really rushing through those stealth bits.
[237:05.88]I kind of was.
[237:08.15]Lost in the sauce.
[237:11.01]Thank you, Knock, for the $1.
[237:13.27]If your watch is blue, that means you're completely visible.
[237:15.73]If you're trying to stealth, you have to turn off almost every single light source.
[237:19.77]Get a silencer for the revolver.
[237:22.22]However, the sound of breaking lanterns will alert guards, and even your silent shots are audible if they're close enough, like six or seven feet.
[237:30.74]I know I'm making you read a lot today, but I don't want you to have bad impressions.
[237:33.82]No, I don't have a bad impression of Metro.
[237:37.57]You would have heard it.
[237:39.16]You would have heard me like lose my mind about this game.
[237:41.38]I would have been like, oh, it's fucking stupid.
[237:43.06]This game's fucking stupid.
[237:44.68]It's dumb.
[237:45.26]Like, oh, like fucking terrible controls.
[237:47.08]Like sloppy.
[237:47.90]Like you guys know like the typical like complain dog shit that I do.
[237:51.52]You know, it's, it's, I didn't do any of that.
[237:54.98]I was having like a good time.
[237:56.50]It was a fun, it's a fun game.
[237:58.86]But thank you.
[237:59.32]I appreciate the advice.
[238:01.24]Never trust a purple.
[238:01.82]Thanks for the $5.
[238:02.64]Little known fact, the 2X scope can be used as an air filtration device.
[238:09.95]I don't think that... That's not real.
[238:11.99]But thanks for the $5, dude.
[238:14.29]Jellox11, thanks for the $5.
[238:16.30]Merry Christmas, you goofball.
[238:17.56]Thanks for being the most entertaining streamer on Twitch.
[238:20.46]Thank you.
[238:21.40]And my favorite YouTuber.
[238:22.52]That's a two-piece.
[238:24.06]Keep up the great streams.
[238:25.24]I'm gonna.
[238:26.68]Just you watch tomorrow.
[238:27.60]I'm gonna be decorating a fucking tree, dude.
[238:30.40]What is wrong with me tonight?
[238:32.32]I swear, I don't even know what the fuck I'm even saying anymore.
[238:34.95]I've like lost my fucking mind.
[238:37.29]Thank you, though.
[238:37.77]I appreciate it.
[238:39.17]You know, I think I'm excited.
[238:40.33]Because Christmas is close.
[238:42.69]And tomorrow's going to be a really fun stream.
[238:45.73]And I'm excited.
[238:47.74]I want to get up.
[238:49.32]I want to get up and fucking go.
[238:51.38]And just do it and play the music.
[238:52.94]Wear the hat.
[238:53.46]I got a fucking funny hat.
[238:54.32]I got a fucking funny vest.
[238:55.30]I'm going to be wearing a reindeer vest.
[238:57.36]It's going to be fucking fantastic.
[238:59.00]You're going to love it.
[239:00.92]Or you're going to hate it.
[239:02.58]Half of you are going to love this stream.
[239:04.13]And half of you are going to hate this stream.
[239:06.84]And the ones that love it are going to be like, oh, well, that was cool.
[239:09.04]I loved it.
[239:09.48]And the ones that hate it are never going to watch another one of my pieces of content ever again.
[239:12.98]So, I mean... It's going to be a 50-50 split, I think.
[239:19.96]We're going to be satanic?
[239:24.81]Shut up and fucking destroy the tree.
[239:29.05]No, it's not going to happen.
[239:31.53]No, you guys... I'm obviously just kidding around.
[239:33.27]It'll be a chill...
[239:35.91]fun, just relaxing stream.
[239:37.18]I'm looking forward to it.
[239:39.68]But thank you to Never Trust Purple again.
[239:41.30]No, you gave $5 and I just read it like it didn't happen because I'm stupid.
[239:47.87]Chowderhead, thank you to Chowderhead for the $1.
[239:49.71]Germa, it is I, the walking seagull.
[239:51.37]Are we on the seagull thing again?
[239:56.82]German, it is I, the walking seagull genocide.
[239:59.39]I have watched you shoot at many of those bastards in this stream, and I am happy you have joined me in my spree of avian-related murder.
[240:07.27]If you drive like 30 minutes up 1A, I have a baseball bat for you.
[240:16.72]I ain't whacking any birds with bats.
[240:19.36]Like, that's not going to happen.
[240:20.68]But thank you, Chowderhead, for the incredibly terrifying message about killing birds.
[240:29.79]Cheeseburger, thanks for the 35 cents.
[240:32.19]Futurebound TV, thanks for the five bucks.
[240:34.35]Jeremy, you're going to play Last Light after this.
[240:36.05]A lot of people want me to keep playing this.
[240:40.17]I probably will.
[240:41.94]I don't see why I won't continue to play it.
[240:45.18]I don't know why I won't.
[240:47.14]There's no reason why I would stop.
[240:49.30]So... Unless I run into a wall in 2033 that makes me hate the fucking game, then we'll just probably blow through all of them.
[241:00.61]When does the one in 2018 come out?
[241:04.67]Last Light is fucking garbage, in your opinion.
[241:06.59]Really?
[241:08.21]Huh.
[241:09.59]Well, we'll see.
[241:12.05]Maybe no Ranger next time.
[241:13.35]That was my own fault.
[241:14.51]I listened to chat make fun of me for being a bad video game player.
[241:17.33]And I was like, I'm going to show them.
[241:18.43]I'll prove them that I'm a good fucking.
[241:19.89]And it just was, it was, it was a total waste of time.
[241:23.21]No, it wasn't.
[241:23.61]It was fun.
[241:24.63]It was a waste of time initially because I didn't even know how to like read my fucking vitals on my watch.
[241:30.97]So we'll see.
[241:33.69]Thank you Stookifier for the 50 cents total.
[241:37.07]Stotham, thanks for the $1.
[241:38.37]What does He-Man drink?
[241:40.41]He-Brews.
[241:42.62]That ain't even a joke.
[241:44.18]That's just like you're just saying that he brews.
[241:47.50]I'll give you a B- for that one.
[241:49.60]That's a B- because that's a meta humor joke.
[241:52.02]I'll give you a B-.
[241:53.56]Cheeseburger, thanks for the $1.
[241:54.64]I love you.
[241:55.10]Well, thank you.
[241:55.56]I love you too.
[241:56.18]Thanks a lot.
[241:56.60]Appreciate it.
[241:59.73]Future Bound TV, again, gave $10 and says...
[242:06.07]bitches because that's the thing that they say back and forth.
[242:10.65]Thanks to that guy.
[242:11.31]Hey, thanks to fucking that guy.
[242:13.97]I didn't even catch his name.
[242:15.03]Thanks for the sub.
[242:16.25]Hey, thanks to that guy too.
[242:19.74]Icky, icky, icky, sticky, whatever his name was.
[242:24.14]I'm so bad with subs, man.
[242:26.84]I feel so bad about it.
[242:31.26]So many people subscribe and shit and
[242:34.69]I just, I have a lot of subscribers now and it's like, I fucking feel terrible that I don't like acknowledge them every day as much as I should.
[242:42.44]Like that guy.
[242:45.34]There he goes.
[242:48.62]2016 Jerma.
[242:51.64]I'm doing great with it.
[242:52.61]I like, and then look at that one.
[242:56.95]It's a martial art.
[243:00.03]We've touched upon it before, but just for the people that don't know that might not have seen why I don't do it anymore, is because the amount of subs and resubs that come in during streams versus the amount of bits, it might even be pretty close now in regards to what happens more often.
[243:22.48]Do bits come in more or do subs come in more?
[243:24.88]But I think a lot of random bits come in and a lot of random subs come in that
[243:30.30]a large portion of this stream if I were to stop and it would be just reading names and especially if I'm in the middle of playing something I have such trouble concentrating anyways so I don't want my stream to turn into just like half playing a game or half doing a like IRL shit like I mean obviously this is what we do now is at the end of the stream I kind of hang out and just read them all except for the subs but
[243:58.65]Well, like now, but this is like the end of the stream is over.
[244:01.23]The stream technically is over right now.
[244:02.91]This is just kind of the wind down at the end of every stream that I do where I just kind of hang out and talk and read the bits.
[244:11.82]But it's sometimes this takes just just to show you like, I mean, obviously, we go off on tangents a lot, like during these end of the stream things.
[244:20.41]But
[244:21.81]If you see how long sometimes it takes just to read through Brit, these British, these fucking British people, you know what I mean?
[244:28.58]You know, if you see how long it takes to read through these sometimes, sometimes it's like 30 or 40 minutes.
[244:33.08]So imagine if like just during the stream, 40 minutes of bits was read in the middle of the stream rather than like at the end when it's nothing's going on, you know what I mean?
[244:46.76]But hopefully I'm scatterbrainedly describing my point there.
[244:52.11]Anyways, thank you to Cheese Riot for the $1.
[244:56.99]You should nail that Santa down just in case.
[245:00.79]He ain't going anywhere.
[245:01.55]He's fucking really heavy.
[245:03.67]I told you, it took like three people to get him in here.
[245:06.65]It took at least three people to get him in here.
[245:09.67]My neighbor had to help.
[245:11.11]Like, that's how fucking hard it was to get this guy in here.
[245:15.61]Punch him.
[245:20.12]punch him?
[245:20.56]You don't want to punch Santa?
[245:25.78]Oh.
[245:27.96]He's... I think he's moving.
[245:30.84]Well, whatever.
[245:33.43]What's he made out of?
[245:34.23]I don't know.
[245:34.71]He's made out of, like, fucking bricks.
[245:38.05]This thing is, like, fucking 300 pounds.
[245:43.31]But, anyways.
[245:44.81]Thank you to Cheese Riot.
[245:47.05]I'm not going to nail him down.
[245:47.97]He's too heavy.
[245:49.21]Alto Tran, thanks for the $1.45.
[245:50.61]Santa comes to life on stream and he shits his pants.
[245:55.07]Well, maybe that's what I'm smelling because then your donation message would make fucking perfect sense.
[246:05.08]Techno Toast, thank you for the $1.
[246:06.38]I thought it was Christmas, not Halloween.
[246:07.90]Hashtag charity, thank you so much.
[246:10.68]It's both.
[246:11.22]Every holiday is the same holiday for me.
[246:14.78]Bill New, thanks for the bits.
[246:16.16]That's called a video, Jeremy.
[246:19.58]Haunty You, thanks for the 450 last bits.
[246:22.42]Merry Christmas, Jerma in chat.
[246:24.38]Merry Christmas, Haunty You.
[246:25.98]We'll see you tomorrow, hopefully, if you're still around.
[246:28.22]If you don't have anything to do, if you don't have any obligations to do, then please come and hang out.
[246:33.31]8 o'clock plus-ish Eastern Standard Time.
[246:37.61]Eastern Standard Time.
[246:39.87]Alpha Gamma, thanks for the $4.00.
[246:44.08]Uh, there's all my bits and now I vanish.
[246:47.65]And he's gone.
[246:48.17]Well, actually he gave $5 because there was one right before that too.
[246:51.83]Uh, and he says, thank you AlphaGamer again.
[246:55.11]I'm the money giving goblin, but you don't take direct payments.
[246:58.45]So here's bits instead.
[246:59.62]And now I vanish.
[247:00.54]Well, you came back and you gave another $4.
[247:02.78]So you're still here.
[247:04.28]Is he still here?
[247:06.28]He just wrote something.
[247:07.27]He's still fucking here.
[247:09.01]I can see him.
[247:10.91]Dragon Breath, thank you so much for the $25.
[247:14.29]25 bucks from Dragon Breath, 75.
[247:18.41]I'm here to share all of my bits I've collected from ads.
[247:21.15]No joke, this is all ad money.
[247:24.62]Damn.
[247:26.16]How many ads do you have to watch to get $25 in bits?
[247:30.22]That's a lot of fucking money.
[247:31.58]That's a lot of ad.
[247:33.10]What is it, like 0.2 cents for one watch of an ad?
[247:39.86]That's going to be PM, not AM, PM.
[247:42.86]That's a lot.
[247:43.92]Holy shit, man.
[247:45.66]You're a very important figure in my life and bring me laughs even in the darkest times.
[247:49.80]For that, I love you and everything you've ever done for your fans.
[247:52.64]Merry Christmas to you and Kim, and I hope you finally get that hair and height growth tonic in your stocking.
[248:00.36]Maybe.
[248:01.84]I didn't eat enough green beans when I was like fucking five, all right?
[248:05.07]I ate Captain Crunch every day for lunch.
[248:07.95]I ate Captain Crunch every day.
[248:10.34]for lunch and dinner.
[248:12.50]Because, like, it was the only way my parents could force me to eat vegetables and food.
[248:17.41]I was so obsessed with Captain Crunch, I would come up to fucking dinner, and my mother would have made something fucking wonderful.
[248:24.69]Chicken, rice, uh, you know, uh, ziti, broccoli, you know, my mother's a fantastic cook.
[248:32.75]And I would need it.
[248:34.85]And she would have to bargain with me with Captain fucking Crunch for me to eat food.
[248:41.73]So I would sit there and be like,
[248:45.96]I'm not eating this unless I have Captain Crunch and she would fucking cave and she would give me like a tiny little like shit serving of cap like, you know, like like a like a cat treat version.
[248:56.28]She would give me like a cat treat sprinkle of Captain Crunch and that's how I would eat it.
[249:00.28]And I think I thought I was playing her.
[249:02.08]I thought I was playing my mother with that shit.
[249:04.86]Like, oh, yeah, she don't even fucking know.
[249:06.50]I'm like, dude, look at this.
[249:07.50]I'm eating Captain Crunch for dinner, motherfucker.
[249:09.74]You know what I mean?
[249:10.26]She's like, oh, yeah, well, you got like four pieces.
[249:14.18]I was a little shit.
[249:15.00]I was a terrible little shit.
[249:16.26]I was an awful little fucking devil person.
[249:19.10]And in my teenage years, I was a fucking, even more of a mutant demon fucking child.
[249:23.58]I already talked about this in a video.
[249:27.46]Well, it's real.
[249:29.03]This is real shit.
[249:29.77]I used to like fucking eat Captain Crunch every day.
[249:34.95]Wow, death ad or elite ad?
[249:39.97]That's what I'm saying.
[249:41.91]Pay no attention to the paint on there.
[249:45.08]DeathAdder.

[250:30.55]I'm seeing a lot more claws than palms here Like what do you guys grab people I
[250:38.58]No, you palm it and you rest.
[250:40.18]And this is the best mouse to palm.
[250:41.94]It's one of the biggest palm mouses.
[250:47.58]Where are we?
[250:49.05]Oh, thank you, by the way.
[250:50.73]Dragon Breath, thank you so much.
[250:51.89]You probably watched like 700 ads.
[250:57.39]Thank you so much for doing that.
[251:01.43]I can't believe somebody would be willing to do that for me.
[251:06.07]I wish you and all your loved ones an extremely happy holidays.
[251:09.91]Merry Christmas.
[251:10.45]Thank you so much.

[251:18.28]And then they did a heart.
[251:19.84]And they also gave another three.
[251:20.86]That's $5.50 here a few hours ago.
[251:23.80]Merry Christmas, chat, from Haunty U. There they are.
[251:30.30]Zowie's the best claw mouse.
[251:32.90]Well, I like palming.
[251:36.48]It feels a little more comfortable for long sessions, especially if you're going to play or even if you're working for more than like three, four, five hours.
[251:43.32]It can be really taxing on your joints to claw.
[251:48.25]Haunty, again, thanks for $4.
[251:49.93]Thanks for the awesome streams.
[251:51.11]Thank you, Jaunty.
[251:53.75]Happy holidays to you.
[251:54.47]Merry Christmas.
[251:55.41]Happy New Year.
[251:58.29]the holidays in a row you know whatever they are there's a lot of them in a row first it's thanksgiving ivory thanks for the one dollar call santa he's tied up in the trash can sharing stale toast with otto please also pet otto and tell him he's been a good boy well I mean otto sometimes does like get into the trash it can be really really annoying and it's you know obviously you don't want to
[252:22.55]have an animal get into the trash, because what's in the trash, so you try to tie it a certain way, you try to put it in a place where he's not going to get to it.
[252:28.20]But sometimes, it just happens.
[252:32.30]And last night, the trash was gotten into, but it didn't look like Otto got into it.
[252:37.77]It was really weird, actually.
[252:44.23]It was very clean.
[252:45.37]It wasn't typically ripped apart.
[252:46.77]It was very clearly whatever was in it.
[252:50.02]It was obviously Otto or the cat.
[252:51.38]It was probably the cat.
[252:52.58]But it looked like they rifled through for quite a while.
[252:56.20]So I don't know.
[253:00.81]But that's strange that you bring that up because I was thinking about that like a few hours ago.
[253:07.32]Anyways, thank you to Holeof1zombie for the $5.
[253:09.82]Genius.
[253:11.31]I think you're referring to me.
[253:12.79]Thank you.
[253:13.13]I've been called that before sometimes.
[253:17.63]StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[253:18.83]Hey, don't tell me but surprised... Hey, don't tell me but surprise me with a happy birthday cheer.
[253:24.71]Shh.
[253:25.39]Keep it a secret.
[253:26.33]Stix will not accept it.
[253:29.95]Happy birthday, Styx.
[253:30.65]Your birthday's, like, coming up.
[253:32.88]Okay, wait.
[253:33.22]I've got to surprise you.
[253:34.32]I'll do that, like... I'll say happy birthday to you, Styx.
[253:37.50]Like, January 3rd.
[253:39.86]That's, like, way after your birthday.
[253:41.76]But, like, I'm going to do a surprise.
[253:42.96]Because you, like, thought I was going to do it, and I didn't.
[253:44.72]And you're like, fuck.
[253:46.44]You didn't do it.
[253:47.02]And then, like, January 6th.
[253:49.36]There it is.
[253:49.72]Surprise.
[253:50.04]I'm going to fucking turn the webcam on and scream at it.
[253:52.07]You're going to be so surprised.
[253:57.87]Thank you, though.
[253:59.73]And obviously, Captain Kurosuchi.
[254:02.61]I want to make sure I say the name right.
[254:05.43]Captain Kurosuchi.
[254:08.00]Thank you for the $100 earlier.
[254:09.56]We got it before, but again, that's fucking incredibly generous.
[254:12.94]Thank you so much.
[254:14.66]Ouch.
[254:15.36]Thank you so much for the $100.
[254:18.82]Happy holidays.
[254:19.64]Merry Christmas.
[254:21.19]Max Man Manus.
[254:22.75]Thank you for the $1.
[254:25.43]You turn off the HUD with Ranger difficulty.
[254:27.53]Not like this.
[254:29.98]I know.
[254:31.14]Laferral, thanks for the $1.
[254:32.47]Germa, you should have seen the movie Downsizing instead of Star Wars.
[254:36.75]I think you would really relate to it.
[254:45.30]Why?
[254:45.62]Why is that?
[254:46.66]Why?
[254:47.08]Oh.
[254:47.74]Oh.
[254:55.90]Thank you, Matherin, for the $5.
[254:57.06]You said...
[254:59.43]The Last Jedi was very low on the Star Wars tier list, but I can't imagine it's worse than the prequels, is it?
[255:04.18]No.
[255:05.22]It's not.
[255:07.02]It is not.
[255:09.46]It's a good movie.
[255:11.20]And without getting really spoilery or talking about The Last Jedi, it's just like... Alright, so they made The Force Awakens.
[255:20.48]And it feels like The Force Awakens and it feels like The Last Jedi is not...
[255:28.63]the sequel to the force awakens does that make any sense it feels like the last jedi was like they took all like the stuff that they brought up in the force awakens and then said who cares and they made a different movie does that make any sense I hope that makes sense it's not like it doesn't feel like a sequel to the the last one episode seven
[255:57.87]It was like Guardians of the Galaxy.
[255:59.17]Yeah, there was a lot of random Guardians of the Galaxy humor.
[256:04.79]I don't know.
[256:10.99]Here's the thing with things that people love, right?
[256:14.13]And this happens in the video game world too.
[256:16.06]This happens in all forms of media.
[256:18.54]When somebody loves something and you say something about it,
[256:25.52]You may as well be outside my fucking house with like knives and torches.
[256:30.98]You know what I mean?
[256:33.18]We live in this climate where if somebody loves something, watch out for those fucking eggshells.
[256:42.41]Because if you say something about that Force Awakens movie, boom!
[256:48.07]See you later.
[256:50.11]The whole world will come after you.
[256:53.61]Gotta love the internet.
[256:56.39]I'll eat you alive.
[256:58.88]But... I would put The Last Jedi... And I really like... I really hate to say this, but I think The Force Awakens was a better movie.
[257:09.96]Are they coming?
[257:10.36]Are they here?
[257:10.78]Are they here?
[257:12.02]Oh, shit!
[257:13.56]Look!
[257:13.86]The doors!
[257:14.36]They're all fucking coming in with knives!
[257:16.55]I'm dead!
[257:17.07]I'm gonna lose!
[257:22.55]Wait, what?
[257:26.03]What is, what is this?
[257:32.72]Oh, that's weird.
[257:33.42]Okay.
[257:37.88]So I like, I'm like, I'm like a squirrel.
[257:39.52]Like I was just like talking and then I saw like a shiny object and was like, oh, what's that?
[257:44.72]Joke alert.
[257:45.20]No, there's no, no jokes.
[257:46.86]There's no joke alert.
[257:48.26]Every time I, we, all right.
[257:51.65]Every time like,
[257:54.51]If I like start to, this is what happens when you're like a fucking dickhead like me, right?
[257:59.11]Everything I say has to be a joke.
[258:01.85]Incoming joke.
[258:02.69]Like, no, like there's no incoming jokes.
[258:06.63]Here it comes.
[258:07.45]Fucking being Mega Man for Halloween.
[258:20.62]You want to see how I do a cheap Mega Man costume?
[258:22.74]Just like this.
[258:33.08]Spray paint it blue.
[258:37.66]Thank you to Peaceful Haley for the $1.
[258:41.42]I saw The Last Jedi and I loved it.
[258:43.04]Here we go.
[258:43.44]Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but it gave me feelings of the older movies.
[258:48.86]And it made me happy.
[258:49.68]Kind of felt like a kid watching it.
[258:50.98]I guess Luke just made the whole movie for me.
[258:56.40]And the fact that it seems they're wanting to take the story into other directions that we might not.
[259:01.34]Yada, yada, yada.
[259:02.76]Yada, yada, yada.
[259:04.24]Let's move away from Star Wars.
[259:05.86]But thank you so much.
[259:07.24]I just don't want to talk about Star Wars anymore.
[259:08.50]And I saw a couple of ha-has in the chat.
[259:09.76]Ban those people forever.
[259:12.06]I want them gone forever.
[259:13.80]And if they ever talk ever again, I will personally contact Twitch TV staff and have them permanently, permanently IP banned from my chat.
[259:25.25]You understand?
[259:25.75]If I see another... Okay, fine.
[259:29.11]If I see another 4,000 to 5,000 ha-has in this chat before I leave, then that's fine.
[259:35.43]You're all going to be permanently internet protocol banned from my fucking chatroom.
[259:42.72]You're on a VPN?
[259:43.56]You don't think I know how to get through those?
[259:47.92]That's a real ha-ha.
[259:49.60]Come on, man.
[259:50.20]Give me a break.
[259:51.88]VPN stands for
[259:54.92]Very passable network.
[259:57.26]Come on, that's like in the hacker forums.
[259:58.50]You don't know that?
[259:59.16]Come on.
[260:00.54]Jesus Christ.
[260:02.58]Rafra, thanks for the $50 before.

[260:25.81]Oh, they're laughing at me.
[260:28.74]Just wait till we kill the memes.
[260:30.24]Just wait till we kill the fucking memes.
[260:32.16]You guys are going to be so sad.
[260:33.60]Because if you think I'm fucking around, I'm not fucking around.
[260:37.62]We're going to kill all these fucking little fun little memes.
[260:41.24]And then if you do them, you're timed up for 30 minutes.
[260:46.01]You can attack my honeypot anytime.

[265:19.42]Yes, they did.
[265:20.70]I swear to God, every time I look over in this fucking chat, I see somebody tells me to punch Santa in his genitals, like in his genital area.
[265:29.06]There it is.
[265:31.72]Didn't even need to look for fucking two seconds.
[265:33.56]There it is again.
[265:35.85]Strange.
[265:38.07]Oh, and somebody wrote something way fucking worse about the genital area.
[265:48.53]Just leave him be.
[265:50.47]There is no Santa joke.
[265:55.43]It's just there.
[265:58.19]And I'm going to let him just hang out until... I don't even know what the fuck I'm going to do with this thing.
[266:06.82]I'm really going over this in my brain.
[266:09.00]This appeared at my fucking door.
[266:12.14]What am I going to do with this?
[266:15.01]This thing is huge.

[266:36.90]Tomorrow's the Christmas stream and then I'm gonna be gone from... So tomorrow, so technically today it's midnight.
[266:45.92]So after tomorrow's stream, that's it for me for at least the next like three or four days.
[266:51.63]There's not going to be a stream on Tuesday.

[267:20.45]Anyways, thanks everybody for watching.
[267:23.09]Much love, much appreciated.
[267:25.88]Before we go though, a couple more Dedo.
[267:28.24]Thank you, Dedo, for the $5.35.
[267:31.92]I feel like I haven't given bits in a while, but I was in a bad space and missing streams, but it feels better now.
[267:38.59]I just want to see you make my day so much better.
[267:40.03]Thank you.
[267:41.87]Uh, you don't, you don't have to correlate giving me money to, um, you know, missing streams and I haven't given any money in a while.
[267:51.72]That's all right, man.
[267:52.48]That's okay.
[267:53.26]I just, I hope you feel better.
[267:55.36]I hope that your, uh, your days, you go day by day getting better.
[267:58.64]So thank you so much for the $5, but do not ever feel like you have to correlate that with watching the stream ever, please.
[268:06.39]You being here is enough fun is enough for me.
[268:09.27]So
[268:11.42]Much love to you.

[268:23.11]Somebody gets it.
[268:25.33]Toby Muerto, thanks for the visit.
[268:26.45]Do your parents ever watch your streams?
[268:27.79]No.
[268:29.59]Maybe like once or twice.
[268:31.99]Like my mother's watched my streams.
[268:34.51]And then like, well, that was weird.
[268:37.51]And she like clicks off in like four minutes.
[268:39.19]So she doesn't like watch the streams.
[268:42.81]And to close this out, we have... A lot of people just came in.
[268:52.45]Hey, look, somebody right there.
[268:55.65]Somebody right there.

[269:33.59]And then it's gonna be all over the fucking internet of me like grabbing Santa.
[269:39.19]Oh, look, there already is an image of me when I was like searching his pockets the other day, yesterday.
[269:44.87]I like put my fucking hands on like around him and like, and all of a sudden it's like all over the internet.
[269:48.35]I'm getting like DMs.

[270:26.79]Like I told you, 90% of everything I ever say is just having fun and dicking around.
[270:30.69]I hope none of you guys take half the things I say seriously.
[270:34.97]I love you guys all.
[270:35.67]You guys are all fucking awesome.
