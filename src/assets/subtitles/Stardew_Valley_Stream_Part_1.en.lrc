[00:17.56]Can you hear my dog eating this little bony ass?
[00:21.76]It was so quiet.
[00:22.62]All you can hear is like... Hold on, can you hear it?
[00:28.26]Let's turn this off.
[00:37.51]Is it good?
[00:49.41]Alright.
[00:53.99]Second sick day in a row.
[00:55.41]Second day I get to catch Jerma stream.
[00:57.08]Well, I hope you feel better, man.
[01:03.22]What do you got?
[01:03.60]What are you sick with?
[01:04.24]You got the flu?
[01:06.76]You got the cold?
[01:07.76]What is it?
[01:16.69]I'm just gonna wait for people to trickle in.
[01:20.49]And we're gonna play this game.
[01:24.45]I know nothing about this game.
[01:26.53]I'm just jumping on the bandwagon.
[01:28.83]Right?
[01:32.90]I've heard this game's really fun.
[01:35.22]And it's kind of like old Harvest Moon-esque gameplay.
[01:40.28]Gonna give it a try.
[01:41.08]If I don't like it, if I'm not into it, then we can just play something else.
[01:44.02]I can finish Layers of Fear.
[01:46.34]I can play some Overwatch.
[01:48.88]You know, whatever, right?
[01:54.30]You got the flu?
[01:56.82]Well, rest up.
[02:03.60]There's not very many options in this game.
[02:06.88]It's kind of just audio off or audio on.
[02:11.44]Or full screen, not full screen.
[02:20.29]Can I grow some babies?
[02:22.81]I can't grow babies.
[02:26.62]I don't have the soil for that.
[02:27.80]I just want to say out of over 500 people you're subscribed to, you're my favorite.
[02:35.89]Well, thank you.
[02:39.27]How are you subscribed to 500 channels?
[02:43.54]I'm lucky if I'm subscribed to like 30.
[02:51.38]Alright, I think people are trickling in now.
[02:53.48]Let's go ahead and get started.
[02:54.74]Don't people need to see how you start the game or something?
[02:58.68]Does that matter at all?
[02:59.34]Well, whatever.
[03:03.06]Let's just go.
[03:09.99]How's the audio?
[03:10.65]Should I lower it?
[03:26.93]Dog, of course.
[03:27.67]I mean, cats are cool, but, you know, dogs rule.
[03:40.25]I'll lower it.
[03:49.56]Better?
[03:57.24]Uh... Well, it's a farm, right?
[04:02.68]We're gonna go with carrots.
[04:03.72]My favorite thing's carrots.
[04:10.31]Should I make it look like me?
[04:12.37]Where's the chicken here?
[04:13.31]Oh, there we go.
[04:14.01]Perfect.
[04:14.39]Should I just be blue?
[04:24.27]Now, I'm going to hate this after a while.
[04:25.77]I'm going to pick up some... There, that's fine.
[04:37.07]I've got to get it close enough.
[04:41.30]I'm starting to get gray hair.
[04:42.26]Yeah, I am going gray.
[04:52.31]I gotta get rid of this Super Mario look.
[04:53.83]I don't really like this.
[04:54.59]If we're gonna go with a Super Mario character, we're gonna go with Luigi.
[05:03.91]No, let's make him... Let's go with these colors.
[05:07.93]Regular pants.
[05:08.97]Jeans.
[05:12.33]What is this?
[05:15.92]Oh, I can turn him around.
[05:20.54]That's a very boring shirt.
[05:21.86]I don't like that shirt.
[05:24.82]Is that a skull?
[05:29.54]Should I go with the Charlie Brown shirt?
[05:32.44]I think I'm going with Charlie Brown.
[05:36.49]I don't have any facial hair.
[05:40.01]Yeah, none of this works.
[05:47.83]Wait, is this duckbill?
[05:50.71]Give me a duck?
[05:51.51]Is there a frog?
[05:54.09]Aww.
[05:57.78]Wait, do I still have, like, a beard?
[06:00.28]No.
[06:06.48]Don't start playing this game, man.
[06:07.80]You're gonna get sucked in.
[06:10.58]Well, don't worry.
[06:11.16]Can we skip the intro?
[06:14.53]You can't skip the intro.
[06:15.53]I've never seen it before.
[06:20.55]Should I put the duck bill back on?
[06:24.31]Yeah, the duck bill's going on.
[06:26.59]We're gonna have to go with duck Charlie Brown.
[06:28.11]I like that better.
[06:28.75]It's too boring.
[06:29.67]We're too plain.
[06:31.47]Plus, I have the chicken hair, too, so that makes even more sense.
[06:35.13]That's good.
[06:36.43]Okay, let's go.
[06:36.99]Is this Santa?
[06:46.00]Do I get a special present from Santa Claus?
[06:49.38]And for my special grandson.
[06:55.40]I want you to have the sealed envelope.
[07:00.07]I can't just tell you what it is.
[07:02.59]Take it.
[07:05.81]No, no, don't open it yet.
[07:06.79]Have patience.
[07:09.31]Why does he have a sword?
[07:10.57]What's that with that fucking sword up there?
[07:14.63]Listen closely.
[07:16.25]There will come a day when you feel crushed by the burden of modern life.
[07:24.09]I take a long time to say sentences, and your bright spirit will fade before a growing emptiness.
[07:29.45]Jeez, Grandpa, you're getting real heavy here.
[07:32.51]You're getting a little too deep, Grandpa.
[07:36.61]When that happens, my boy, you'll be ready for this gift.
[07:41.20]And please take my Arabian saber off the wall and go kill your grandmother.
[07:47.10]Is that 20 years later?
[07:54.45]Oh boy.
[07:56.01]JoJo, join us, thrive.
[07:57.53]Work or rest?
[07:59.95]Do I need to do something here?
[08:04.41]Terminated.
[08:06.82]It's Woody!
[08:07.22]That's Woody from Toy Story!
[08:09.26]What is he doing here?
[08:10.02]Oh, well, this is the best job ever.
[08:13.02]I get to work with Woody from Toy Story?
[08:16.48]And Skeletor?
[08:17.96]Come on!
[08:25.52]I guess I'm not happy.
[08:29.81]Should I open up the envelope?
[08:30.93]Can I go back to work?
[08:38.19]Dear Greg, if you're reading this, you must be in dire need of a change.
[08:42.19]The same thing happened to me long ago.
[08:44.09]I lost sight of what mattered most in life.
[08:46.73]Real connections with other people and nature.
[08:49.55]So I dropped everything and moved to the place I truly belong.
[08:52.95]The North Pole.
[08:54.89]I've enclosed the deed to that place, my pride and joy.
[08:58.09]Greg's Farm is located in Stardew Valley on the southern coast.
[09:03.11]It's the perfect place to start your new life.
[09:06.10]This was my most precious gift of all, and now it's yours.
[09:10.14]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[09:15.56]And, Radio Vidya, and yes, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[09:23.05]Thanks for the sub, welcome.
[09:25.60]Okay.
[09:26.04]Let's go.
[09:26.36]Let's quit my job.
[09:29.64]Alright, we're on a bus.
[09:30.52]We're on our way.
[09:31.14]Do I drive the bus?
[09:55.34]No, this is just a cut scene.
[09:56.92]I'm excited right now, I really am.
[10:05.57]Why am I like this excited, why?
[10:07.57]It doesn't make any sense.
[10:15.30]I'm so happy, I'm ready to play this game.
[10:21.24]Hey, you must be Greg.
[10:22.56]I'm Robin, the local carpenter.
[10:25.09]Mayor Lewis sent me here to fetch you and show you the way to your new home.
[10:29.25]He's there right now tidying things up for your arrival.
[10:33.81]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[10:37.07]DJ Gabraham.
[10:39.43]DJ Gabraham.
[10:41.29]Thanks.
[10:41.57]Welcome, man.
[10:44.25]Oh boy.
[10:45.81]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[10:48.56]The calzone monster just subscribed.
[10:50.70]Thanks, guys.
[10:52.08]Welcome to the jock-shock-shock-jockers.
[10:56.24]Greg's farm.
[10:57.18]Okay.
[10:57.46]This place is a mess.
[11:02.11]This is the Citizen Kane of games.
[11:05.53]Sure, it's a bit overgrown, but there's some good soil underneath that mess.
[11:08.63]With a little dedication, you'll have it cleaned up in no time.
[11:13.14]Oh man, I'm gonna have to clean this place up.
[11:15.36]I can't wait.
[11:16.66]I can't wait to do yard work.
[11:21.20]Here we are, your new home.
[11:25.88]There he is, this Lewis.
[11:28.16]Ah, the new farmer.
[11:30.70]Derpy of Derpy.
[11:32.24]Welcome, welcome, thanks.
[11:36.82]Welcome.
[11:37.30]I'm Lewis, Mayor of Pelican Town.
[11:39.74]You know, everyone's been asking about you.
[11:42.15]It's not every day that some little shit moves in.
[11:44.69]It's quite a big deal.
[11:49.85]So, you're moving into your grandfather's old cottage.
[11:52.65]This is a good house.
[11:53.41]It's very rustic.
[11:54.81]And by rustic, that's in quotes because it means it's shit.
[12:04.03]Rustic, that's one way to put it.
[12:05.33]Crusty.
[12:06.01]See, I told you crusty might be a little more of a way to put it.
[12:09.91]Rude!
[12:12.63]What a funny, happy game.
[12:15.41]Don't listen to her, Greg.
[12:16.39]She's just trying to make you dissatisfied that you buy one of her house upgrades.
[12:24.60]How anime of her.
[12:27.02]Anyway, you must be tired from the long journey.
[12:28.98]You should get some rest.
[12:30.50]Tomorrow you have to explore the town a bit and introduce yourself.
[12:34.11]Townspeople would appreciate that.
[12:37.01]See you later.
[12:37.59]I'm getting out of here.
[12:42.33]Oh, I almost forgot.
[12:43.43]If you have anything to sell, just place it in this box.
[12:46.08]I'll come by during the night and collect it.
[12:48.26]And I also might take stuff from your house at night.
[12:51.50]Because I'm a fucking cat burglar.
[12:52.92]Alright, I'm done.
[12:54.12]No more voices.
[12:54.84]We're just gonna play.
[13:00.54]Hey, handsome.
[13:01.10]Oh, hi.
[13:06.30]W-A-S-D.
[13:07.22]Oh, it's a W-A-S-D game.
[13:08.24]Skill shots!
[13:09.84]I told you I knew it.
[13:11.47]Oh, fuck.
[13:11.87]What did I pick up?
[13:13.25]Decorative bowl?
[13:14.57]Decorative... Decorative bowl.
[13:19.49]Decorative... Decorative bowl.
[13:22.57]Right?
[13:24.03]Decorative bowl.
[13:27.20]Am I on drugs?
[13:27.92]Why am I not saying... Decorative bowl.
[13:30.08]Done.
[13:30.26]Alright, let's pick this up.
[13:36.51]Oh, no, hold on.
[13:37.49]You can play with the controller.
[13:38.45]Are you kidding me?
[13:41.71]Oh, done deal.
[13:43.19]No, turn this off.
[13:47.26]There we go, options.
[13:49.62]How do I turn off my gamepad?
[13:54.02]1400 by 900.
[13:57.23]That's not what I want.
[13:59.39]Hold on, get rid of this.
[14:04.17]Okay, now the control's not going to be moving around.
[14:05.61]Alright, should I just make this full screen and make it 1920x1080?
[14:08.94]Okay.
[14:13.36]No, full screen.
[14:17.14]What's going on here?
[14:20.89]There we go.
[14:22.77]1920x1080.
[14:23.73]Let's get some real good graphics in here, you know?
[14:28.67]There we go.
[14:31.34]Auto run?
[14:31.84]I don't even know if I want that.
[14:32.92]I don't even know if I want any of these things.
[14:38.48]That's probably a little better.
[14:41.88]Dialog, footstep, full screen, menu, taskbar, controller, rumble, get out of here.
[14:47.21]Okay.
[14:49.07]I'm just going to go.
[14:49.97]Did that screw everything up over here?
[14:51.31]Or does that look fine?
[14:52.47]I think it looks fine.
[14:58.78]Champagne has always been celebrated for its existence.
[15:02.04]Jerma is... Oh, come on now.
[15:08.10]I've never talked about my sexual preferences before, guys.
[15:15.72]I can move these things around?
[15:17.77]Thanks for subbing, though.
[15:23.51]I guess you can just move stuff around in your house.
[15:26.54]Look at this old-ass TV.
[15:32.24]How can I upgrade my TV?
[15:33.14]Because that thing sucks.
[15:33.88]Do I have to smash this with a hammer?
[15:43.32]How do I open my present?
[15:49.13]Spanky Pants 420!
[15:49.97]Well, we're just going to leave it because I don't know what the hell is going on.
[15:58.89]Thanks for seven, dude.
[16:01.33]Look at this.
[16:02.25]I get to clean everything up.
[16:03.31]This is so cool.
[16:04.61]What do I do first?
[16:10.26]Did you see that?
[16:10.98]Did you see how satisfying it was to hit the grass?
[16:17.97]Do you only have one mouse button?
[16:20.55]Do I?
[16:21.55]What are you talking about?
[16:27.15]So what do I do?
[16:27.75]Do these all?
[16:29.07]So this is like a shovel?
[16:32.55]Okay.
[16:34.17]That's a scythe.
[16:40.02]Holy shit, this game looks boring.
[16:42.44]Somebody just said.
[16:45.10]I'm just checking it out.
[16:48.34]That's what we do.
[16:48.78]We check out games.
[16:53.16]Ah, I just picked up some wood.
[16:59.88]It's a relaxing game.
[17:01.16]We have to... A frog!
[17:03.74]Please tell me I get pets.
[17:04.58]If I get pets, I'm going to love this.
[17:08.94]Uh... I'm assuming I need to pick to get the stone.
[17:12.07]Yep.
[17:13.93]What does this mean?
[17:15.27]Journal.
[17:17.89]It would be a nice gesture to introduce yourself around town.
[17:20.57]Some people might be anxious to meet the new farmer.
[17:23.29]I gotta go meet people?
[17:26.13]There's like 30 people I have to go meet.
[17:27.63]Is this The Sims?
[17:34.20]Should I go do that?
[17:34.82]What's in my mailbox?
[17:40.58]I feel like the game wants me to go do that.
[17:44.44]Oh my god, this place is a fucking mess.
[17:49.34]I need to repair this.
[17:50.08]What happened over here?
[17:50.70]Alright, let's go meet people.
[17:55.06]Let's go do what the game told me to do.
[18:01.79]Just look at the sign.
[18:02.57]Don't hit it.
[18:06.29]Bus stop and then Pelican Town.
[18:07.74]Well, we want to go to Pelican Town.
[18:08.94]That's where everybody is.
[18:11.26]What's that?
[18:14.28]Oh.
[18:15.36]That's from Super Mario 2.
[18:16.38]I just got the Super Mario 2 item.
[18:25.85]Can I trash this place?
[18:27.54]Can I cut these things down for my own profit?
[18:30.40]Probably not.
[18:32.34]Okay, here's a person.
[18:33.52]Act natural.
[18:36.86]This is interesting.
[18:39.32]White Fang!
[18:45.64]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[18:47.44]Did I just give that guy something?
[18:48.70]Hey, I'm Sam.
[18:52.78]Good to meet you.
[18:53.38]Yeah, give me my seeds back.
[18:56.23]It's a couple logs.
[18:59.99]Oh, I already gave him a gift.
[19:01.67]What an awful gift.
[19:03.97]I gave that guy a handful of seeds.
[19:06.30]If somebody gave that to me as a gift, I would throw it over my shoulder.
[19:10.76]After he left.
[19:11.38]Alright, what do you want?
[19:13.16]You want some wood?
[19:15.29]I guess everyone has different tastes.
[19:17.97]Oh, you're welcome.
[19:20.25]What about you?
[19:20.67]You want one of these?
[19:21.25]Oh, I guess I'll take it.
[19:23.43]Yeah, you will.
[19:23.97]What about you?
[19:25.59]Glasses guy.
[19:26.76]No, glasses guy definitely wants a rock.
[19:30.70]Hmm, are you sure this is healthy?
[19:33.04]Yeah, I'm sure.
[19:34.54]Go put it to good use.
[19:37.76]Let's go over here.
[19:40.09]How do I put this down?
[19:40.89]There we go.
[19:47.89]Alright, let's take a look.
[19:50.95]Where's the jermaMoon emote from?
[19:52.59]It's the moon.
[19:54.57]It's Grandpa's birthday this Sunday.
[19:57.01]I gotta get him something special, like a rock.
[20:01.59]Vincent's birthday at the egg festival?
[20:03.19]This is fucking cool!
[20:04.31]Look at this, there's an egg festival!
[20:07.39]I gotta be ready for this.
[20:08.35]I need to get good clothes.
[20:09.69]I need to freshen up.
[20:15.49]Do you have any dialog options with people?
[20:18.55]That's right, I heard someone new was moving into the old farm.
[20:21.00]Yeah, it's me.
[20:23.50]Hey, take a bush.
[20:25.94]What am I supposed to do with this?
[20:26.94]I don't know, what am I supposed to do with this?
[20:31.30]Do you want one?
[20:33.84]No, I got cleaning to do.
[20:36.02]Get out of here.
[20:37.03]Put this down.
[20:39.73]See, I met the townspeople.
[20:40.89]I can go back and clean up my residence.
[20:48.82]Whose dog is this?
[20:49.88]Where is he?
[20:51.98]There's a lot to explore in this game, too.
[20:53.38]That's kind of cool.
[20:56.43]Whose house is this?
[20:57.07]That's either P-Man or Pie-Man.
[21:00.07]Thanks for subbing.
[21:00.45]Welcome to the family!
[21:13.37]Alright, well I've succeeded in giving people rocks and sticks.
[21:17.15]Hi.
[21:18.45]Oh, did you want something?
[21:21.33]Kinda.
[21:21.61]I'm just gonna plunge- You know what I'm gonna do?
[21:26.01]I'm gonna drop like a bunch of bushes in her fucking bedroom.
[21:29.83]You're not good enough friends with Penny to enter her bedroom.
[21:32.80]Fine.
[21:34.54]I'm just gonna give you ants.
[21:39.00]What's with the Safari music?
[21:44.57]I want to go clean up.
[21:46.09]I don't even have any enough money.
[21:47.23]I gotta sell my stuff to Grandpa.
[21:48.65]There's so many people to meet.
[21:55.80]How many people have I... I've only met five people?
[21:59.52]What are you talking about?
[22:00.22]I've, like, talked to seven or eight, at least.
[22:03.53]Welcome to our little community, Evelyn.
[22:06.05]Oh, Granny!
[22:06.99]Oh, thanks, Granny.
[22:07.75]See, look.
[22:09.37]What?
[22:10.63]There's that many people?
[22:13.18]I think I'm just going to be anti-social and not care.
[22:17.67]You are how I imagined.
[22:20.47]That's not very nice.
[22:22.25]You must be Greg, the new farmer.
[22:23.41]Oh, hi, Caroline.
[22:27.61]Oh, look, it's little Vincent.
[22:30.69]Mama says not to talk to strangers, but you seem okay.
[22:33.03]Well, look, little Vincent, Mama also told you not to talk to people that give you things, either.
[22:37.46]So here, take the Mario 2 plant.
[22:43.22]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[22:45.78]Pickle of death.
[22:48.12]Welcome to the shit stains.
[22:52.39]Enjoy your stale stay.
[22:58.15]How likely is Jerma to make actual progress here?
[23:00.80]That's a good question.
[23:01.68]We're going to make progress right now.
[23:04.58]We're going to go back.
[23:05.18]I don't need to go to the bus.
[23:06.80]Wait, what's that?
[23:09.00]Daffodil.
[23:14.22]I like it though.
[23:15.00]Something about this is fun.
[23:17.50]I like walking around as Charlie Brown Duck.
[23:22.82]Ah, you see like the noises?
[23:24.24]See how relaxing that was?
[23:30.41]No, I need to use the pick.
[23:33.79]One at a time.
[23:34.33]One thing at a time.
[23:34.81]Let's get rid of all the rocks and shit.
[23:44.04]So there's a day-night cycle.
[23:45.46]I don't want to miss Lewis's birthday.
[23:46.86]That's really important.
[23:47.72]I've got to get him a really good present, too.
[23:49.24]Now, can I plant anything here?
[23:57.13]Do tools have durability?
[23:58.35]Or can I just walk around and hit everything?
[24:03.53]Two wood.
[24:11.98]All these noises sound like Terraria.
[24:14.58]It is kind of like a little Terraria vibe.
[24:16.17]The way you swing the axe.
[24:17.61]You're starting to feel exhausted.
[24:21.93]Do I have any energy drinks?
[24:23.77]Isn't that how games like this work?
[24:28.43]Don't I have food I can eat to make me ten times stronger?
[24:32.57]I don't like that.
[24:37.40]Get this over there.
[24:40.94]Why have I not figured out how to open this?
[24:42.36]Alright, well I'm exhausted.
[24:51.63]270.
[24:51.65]Okay, so should I just go to bed?
[24:59.03]I don't know.
[25:03.87]It won't let me go to sleep.
[25:04.77]Should I plant my daffodil?
[25:10.06]Eat the daffodil.
[25:14.36]I hope it wasn't poisonous.
[25:17.22]That didn't do anything.
[25:19.96]Can I eat the bush?
[25:24.12]Should I not have eaten that daffodil?
[25:31.21]You don't have any... There you go.
[25:34.07]Alright, give me my stones here.
[25:37.59]Take some coal, too.
[25:39.34]And the bush.
[25:39.86]Alright.
[25:43.02]Should make some money.
[25:48.82]Starting to get dark.
[25:52.99]Probably not.
[25:55.75]Day two, you have died from daffodil poisoning.
[26:03.99]Alright, it's time for bed.
[26:05.19]It's 7.50 p.m.
[26:06.53]That's when people go to bed.
[26:07.45]Do skeletons come... Do zombies come out at night to try to kill me?
[26:18.20]Oh, shit.
[26:20.54]Okay, okay, I'm going.
[26:21.94]I'm going.
[26:25.92]I'm going.
[26:26.36]It was that easy?
[26:32.25]I feel like I did that a hundred times.
[26:36.41]Here's a little something to get you started.
[26:37.99]Alright, parsnip seeds.
[26:39.73]Plant these in the spring, takes four days to mature.
[26:45.95]If you want to become a farmer, you have to start with the basics.
[26:48.18]You use your hoe to till the soil.
[26:51.30]Then use a seed packet on the tilled soil to sow a crop.
[26:55.14]Water every day until the crop is ready for harvest.
[26:58.28]Okay.
[27:01.50]Until the... Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[27:07.07]God, your name is hard to say.
[27:11.23]Psychoblite?
[27:12.49]Psychobliat.
[27:14.85]2015.
[27:14.91]Welcome.
[27:16.91]Time to go to bed.
[27:17.63]Let's go.
[27:22.39]There we go.
[27:23.35]Made 71 cents.
[27:33.22]Alright, now I understand.
[27:35.01]Let's go plant some seeds.
[27:36.71]I don't want to waste all my energy.
[27:38.21]I didn't realize I even had that.
[27:42.04]Hello there.
[27:42.58]Just got back from a fishing trip.
[27:43.56]You should come down to the beach sometime.
[27:46.90]You can fish too.
[27:48.90]Oh.
[27:50.08]Alright.
[27:51.80]So how do I plant these?
[27:52.74]Used to cut grass into hay.
[28:00.30]Used to dig and till soil.
[28:01.51]Here we go.
[28:02.59]There we go.
[28:03.01]Okay, let's go.
[28:07.90]I'm gonna do it right next to the house.
[28:11.56]I have 15, right?
[28:12.20]That means it can go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[28:16.32]Oh, this is awesome.
[28:24.27]This is awesome.
[28:28.49]I can't wait to have a gigantic farm.
[28:30.29]And I'm gonna neglect the shit out of it probably and lose.
[28:38.23]Gonna water them too.
[28:39.01]Yeah!
[28:44.27]It's just like a real farm, except you don't have to do anything.
[28:50.07]Shit, don't waste it.
[29:00.92]Look what I did!
[29:02.34]Look at that!
[29:04.70]And in like a few months I'll have parsnips to eat.
[29:11.08]Oh, fuck.
[29:16.24]So, okay.
[29:17.60]Now I go back to town.
[29:21.27]To the beach.
[29:21.71]Someone named Willy invited you to visit the beach south of town.
[29:24.27]He says he has something to give you.
[29:27.29]Oh, I gotta go.
[29:27.89]Before 5pm.
[29:31.33]Holy shit.
[29:31.87]Somebody in chat just made a good point.
[29:33.05]Is it even spring?
[29:35.11]Oh, no.
[29:36.45]I hope it is.
[29:38.45]No, it's spring, right?
[29:42.72]Well, I gotta check my calendar.
[29:45.08]Is it spring?
[29:49.85]I think, yeah, no, it has to be.
[29:51.05]I think it has to be.
[29:55.49]Give me the bird.
[29:57.09]You can actually grab- you see that?
[29:57.95]I can grab him for a second.
[30:05.48]One spring year- okay, yeah, I remember seeing that too.
[30:09.58]So where's this beach?
[30:12.13]Is there something about a beach?
[30:16.71]Can't wait for the next plot twist.
[30:21.44]We could go in the sewer?
[30:22.44]Fuck the beach, let's go in the sewer and be Ninja Turtles.
[30:24.68]That's too bad.
[30:27.34]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[30:36.17]Captain Blalby.
[30:38.27]Captain Blalby.
[30:40.88]Thanks for hanging out.
[30:41.54]Thanks for subbing.
[30:43.42]Welcome.
[30:45.66]He's going to give me a fishing rod.
[30:46.64]It's going to be so cool.
[30:47.42]I can't wait.
[30:49.38]This guy's fucking dirty.
[30:50.36]I heard there was a newcomer in town.
[30:53.35]Good to finally meet you.
[30:55.73]Didn't he have something for me?
[30:58.63]I'm still trying to unwind for a month on the salty seas.
[31:02.03]There was a big haul.
[31:02.89]I sold a lot of good shit.
[31:03.63]Look at his blue eyes.
[31:04.55]Wow.
[31:05.15]Matches the ocean.
[31:07.31]Finally saved enough to buy me a new rod.
[31:10.07]So take my old one.
[31:11.11]Yep.
[31:17.23]Okay, cool.
[31:21.60]Legend of Zelda.
[31:22.92]I like it.
[31:24.78]Bamboo pole.
[31:27.98]He's going to teach me how to fish.
[31:29.08]There's good water here in the valley.
[31:32.10]All kinds of fish.
[31:36.30]Shop's back open.
[31:37.08]Come by if you need any supplies.
[31:38.59]I'll also buy anything you catch.
[31:41.61]If it smells, it sells.
[31:44.65]That's what my old pappy used to say, anyhow.
[31:48.53]So if I fish here and I can pick up stuff and sell it over there and I can buy things, it's just gonna be, you know, whatever.
[31:57.84]So... Using the water to catch a fish.
[32:05.53]Oh, okay.
[32:06.17]I need to hold it.
[32:10.50]What a terrible cast.
[32:13.24]Now, how come nobody told me how to do this?
[32:14.84]Hold on.
[32:15.12]I think it will here.
[32:17.09]No.
[32:18.39]No.
[32:25.65]Try to... Oh, pull it up.
[32:28.62]Click to raise bar.
[32:30.30]Release to lower bar.
[32:31.54]Help bar... I don't even know what that meant.
[32:32.96]What is it saying?
[32:34.08]Click to raise bar.
[32:35.04]Release to lower bar.
[32:36.10]Keep bar behind fish.
[32:37.50]Okay.
[32:45.87]Like, keep it on the fish?
[32:48.47]Oh, okay.
[32:49.05]I get it.
[32:51.85]A herring.
[32:52.55]Eight inch herring.
[32:53.45]Let's go again.
[33:12.70]We got one!
[33:14.54]It's a big one!
[33:15.86]Oh, fuck.
[33:18.44]Bye.
[33:21.42]I'm almost out of energy, too.
[33:23.96]Okay, what's a herring worth?
[33:26.82]Wait a minute, I can eat this.
[33:31.15]Plus 13 energy, 5 health.
[33:33.09]Could I cook it?
[33:34.97]What do I get for selling it?
[33:37.63]Oh, that's a better pull.
[33:39.11]Trout soup.
[33:42.30]I guess I'll just give it to him, right?
[33:45.90]I want to sell you my fish.
[33:46.92]There we go.
[33:52.95]So that was... Yeah, that's worth it.
[33:55.19]See if I can get another one.
[34:00.99]Try a different spot.
[34:04.99]My god, I'm going to be, like, obsessed with this game.
[34:09.95]I'm gonna be such a loser.
[34:12.27]I'm gonna just only play this game and not do anything else for the rest of my life.
[34:19.33]You're gonna come back in 12 years and I'll still be fishing here.
[34:28.36]Got it.
[34:29.02]Okay, now I gotta keep it here.
[34:30.48]This is actually fairly difficult.
[34:44.09]This is going to be a big one.
[34:44.81]I can tell.
[34:52.61]That much fight for a one-inch sardine?
[34:55.79]The herring was easier to catch.
[34:59.70]The herring was easier to catch.
[35:02.78]I could go buy a pack of those.
[35:04.42]That's right on the beach.
[35:10.44]What a big one.
[35:18.53]I'm almost out of energy.
[35:20.65]How did I... How am I out of energy?
[35:22.09]It's 1 o'clock.
[35:24.67]Where's the coffee you can drink in this game?
[35:26.17]Seriously.
[35:33.32]There better not be another sardine.
[35:39.84]It's a sardine.
[35:40.50]Alright, come on.
[35:41.14]Let's go.
[35:42.24]Just fucking eat these.
[35:49.32]More energy, eat it again.
[35:54.96]So am I just going to be out here?
[35:56.77]Fishing?
[35:57.95]Losing energy while fishing?
[36:02.13]And eating to gain energy?
[36:05.35]Nah, that's where all the little shitfish are.
[36:07.23]We're going to a different spot.
[36:11.57]We're going to Willy's secret spot.
[36:15.50]Right by the turd rock.
[36:18.96]All the fish hang out at the fucking turd rock.
[36:26.59]Guarantee it.
[36:27.07]This is going to be like a 20-incher.
[36:35.91]Swallow all the bones.
[36:37.14]Eat all those bones.
[36:42.80]It's going to be a big one.
[36:50.52]This fish is not even fighting at all.
[36:53.32]Okay.
[36:55.28]It's an anchovy.
[36:57.64]The as-gross worst cousin of sardine.
[37:02.80]What about, can I get a crab?
[37:03.72]No.
[37:10.39]Right on the shallow end of the beach.
[37:17.67]Give me a king crab.
[37:19.27]I know they're in season.
[37:25.39]This is long time fishing.
[37:30.72]It's gonna be another anchovy.
[37:32.30]It's not even fighting me.
[37:35.76]Put up a fight.
[37:42.39]Alright, I'm going to cook these things.
[37:45.85]Hold on a second.
[37:51.91]Fuck!
[37:53.23]There's all this broken down wood and shit.
[37:55.00]I can't pick it up?
[37:55.60]I have to be able to pick that up, right?
[37:57.84]I'm too tired.
[37:58.52]Eat a fish, quick.
[37:59.24]No, I gotta cook.
[38:00.44]I'm cooking it.
[38:03.18]No, I don't want to eat it.
[38:04.32]Put it away.
[38:07.10]Okay, yeah, I can break these.
[38:10.88]I cannot break them.
[38:12.52]I probably can, but I'm not doing it right.
[38:17.06]Who lives in this shack?
[38:20.50]Only Elliot's friends can enter.
[38:21.84]What is this?
[38:26.20]No, I wanted to... 300 pieces of wood?
[38:32.91]I have to eat this fish now.
[38:36.51]I can at least walk back to my house.
[38:38.27]Am I unhappy?
[38:43.64]You're very unhappy.
[38:49.04]I'll hold on to that.
[38:52.04]Oh, hi.
[38:52.74]My name's Greg.
[38:53.31]I'm the new fisherman in town.
[38:54.69]Mm-hmm.
[39:00.86]Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you too, Fabio.
[39:02.54]Bye.
[39:04.02]Wait a minute.
[39:06.20]Do you like fish?
[39:09.32]Yes, he likes it.
[39:10.82]He liked it.
[39:11.64]See, he's almost in love with me.
[39:14.67]He's so close to being in love with me after giving him that fish.
[39:22.87]Okay, let's go rest up.
[39:28.35]Oh, he died.
[39:30.75]Who are these people that died?
[39:34.03]It's old and faded.
[39:37.71]Our beloved Mona.
[39:42.80]That's another language I don't know.
[39:45.94]Probably says something.
[39:46.66]You want me to shovel him?
[39:57.29]Yeah, I can't do anything else or I'm exhausted.
[39:59.87]I need to go back to bed.
[40:02.63]Where's the Metal Gear Solid cigar?
[40:04.56]I need to fast forward four hours.
[40:11.30]When I smoke it, it needs to go... I can't even do it.
[40:24.34]Well, I'm learning now, right?
[40:26.66]Oh, geez.
[40:29.52]Oh, it's a secret pond.
[40:31.68]I found a secret pond.
[40:42.53]You bet you guys didn't know about this.
[40:45.99]I just threw it in the deep end, too.
[40:47.05]Is there a can of soda in there?
[40:54.89]I don't want to drink this.
[40:56.87]It says trash.
[41:04.94]That's disgusting.
[41:09.16]That's disgusting.
[41:10.16]Why would you drink that?
[41:15.03]I just found this unopened Coke at the bottom of the ocean or the lake.
[41:19.85]I think I might drink the whole thing.
[41:27.20]There's just sodas down here.
[41:30.26]This is the soda well.
[41:32.40]Are there any fish in here?
[41:33.32]Or is this just people threw their cans of coke in here?
[41:35.76]If I get another can of soda, I swear to God.
[41:41.37]Oh, I got a newspaper.
[41:52.17]What does it say?
[41:53.78]Can I read it?
[41:55.26]Can I eat it?
[41:58.87]Alright, one more before it's time for bed.
[42:05.29]Oh, shit.
[42:07.49]I wasn't paying attention.
[42:09.23]I'm too tired.
[42:09.89]Quick, drink the energy drink.
[42:12.34]We're fishing out here all night, boys.
[42:16.40]Whatever I find that's edible in here, I'm gonna eat it.
[42:32.52]Come on.
[42:36.25]What is this trash, trash?
[42:38.67]No, I'm exhausted.
[42:39.81]Time for bed.
[42:46.39]I love my guy's face right now.
[42:49.21]Oh god, what an awful day.
[42:51.23]What a terrible day that was.
[42:52.64]I didn't do shit.
[42:54.96]I watered a few plants.
[42:57.75]I drank a bunch of 45-year-old soda cans.
[43:00.13]I have indigestion.
[43:05.33]Here.
[43:06.98]I got you something.
[43:08.60]It's an old newspaper.
[43:13.98]Hold on a second.
[43:15.26]I got something better.
[43:15.96]You've already given her two gifts this week.
[43:21.03]Would you classify those as gifts?
[43:22.47]I don't think so.
[43:30.14]I found an old soggy newspaper for you, Carol.
[43:34.92]Oh my god, I'm so slow.
[43:39.68]So that girl's not going to like me, huh?
[43:41.94]Well, scratch her off the list.
[43:44.68]Of potential mates.
[43:51.34]How is my house over here?
[43:53.02]It's getting too dark for me to even remember.
[43:57.08]Go.
[43:57.36]Go!
[43:57.90]Come on, I have a can of water.
[44:00.74]Drink the watering can.
[44:01.62]That'll get some energy.
[44:05.44]He didn't drink it.
[44:07.21]He just spilled it a little bit.
[44:11.71]Whose house is this?
[44:13.33]This is somebody's castle.
[44:17.39]Oh, God.
[44:19.61]I'm the new guy.
[44:20.41]I don't know where I'm going.
[44:25.49]Oh, shit.
[44:26.57]Can I eat the seeds?
[44:31.76]Okay, now I know.
[44:33.30]It takes a couple of days, right?
[44:35.72]I know that it takes a ton of energy to plant things and to water things.
[44:43.13]Shit, it's going to be midnight.
[44:44.81]That's when I turn into a gremlin.
[44:46.69]I've got to get back.
[44:48.83]Where's my compass?
[44:50.45]Oh, shit.
[44:51.75]No.
[44:51.97]No.
[44:54.59]This is where I turn into a mouse.
[44:56.09]What happens in Cinderella?
[45:01.79]I don't even know if I'm going the right way.
[45:05.02]Can you die?
[45:07.58]Because if you can die, I'm probably going to die right here.
[45:12.18]I'm so lost.
[45:15.52]Do I actually have a map?
[45:17.21]Oh my god, I have a map.
[45:19.85]Why didn't the old guy tell me about that?
[45:23.29]Shit.
[45:24.03]It's up there.
[45:38.12]I'm gonna pass out Eat a seed I can't eat the seeds.
[45:48.37]What about the trash?
[45:49.39]Will it keep me going for like at least another five minutes?
[45:56.73]I'm not even fucking close.
[45:59.17]I'm not even close.
[46:00.52]I'm not even close.
[46:07.18]It's gonna take me till 5 a.m.
[46:09.08]to get back up there.
[46:09.78]Are you serious?
[46:11.42]This town is fucking tiny.
[46:13.18]Oh wait, I am here.
[46:13.77]I just did an update.
[46:19.81]What are you doing out here this late?
[46:21.53]It's two o'clock in the morning.
[46:22.51]What are you doing?
[46:25.73]Go to bed.
[46:28.44]Are you kidding me?
[46:32.06]I'm almost home.
[46:35.06]Oh, no.
[46:38.25]I'm right outside my door.
[46:39.65]I'm back.
[46:45.47]Okay, so hold on a second.
[46:46.79]I'm back in my house.
[46:50.57]What happened?
[46:53.44]Did somebody find me?
[46:57.35]Dear Mr. Greg, last night a Joju team member found you incapacitated.
[47:01.43]A medical team was dispatched to bring you home safely.
[47:04.47]We're glad you're okay.
[47:06.94]You've been billed 60 gold for this service.
[47:11.74]60 gold?
[47:13.74]That's a racket.
[47:17.82]Okay, go back to bed.
[47:22.72]I don't have energy to sleep.
[47:24.49]Go to bed at 6 a.m.
[47:29.71]Full energy.
[47:30.63]Boom.
[47:31.35]There you go.
[47:33.05]All I needed to do is do what Peter Parker did that one time.
[47:37.36]Spider-Man slept for two days straight and he got his powers back.
[47:39.98]Remember?
[47:40.28]That's what happened.
[47:41.66]I just did that.
[47:42.16]It just happened.
[47:42.64]And it was raining, so these things got plenty of water.
[47:47.72]Is this ready to be picked up?
[47:54.06]No, not quite.
[47:54.60]I'm just gonna water them again.
[47:57.34]Keep an eye on my energy bar this time.
[48:00.52]Didn't it say four days?
[48:01.26]Or has it been like three?
[48:10.37]Alright, things are looking up.
[48:12.47]I figured out the basics.
[48:15.37]I had a fever dream and I passed out in the middle of my town on the first day I got there.
[48:19.15]Alright, things are looking good.
[48:26.19]So I can do a little bit more cleanup, right?
[48:28.55]That's probably what I should be doing.
[48:32.75]Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[48:39.78]No, that's not the right tool.
[48:47.18]Oh, that's satisfying.
[48:50.69]Do you see how satisfying that just was?
[48:52.67]Alright, after I clear this area in front...
[49:02.28]That's it, I'm gonna conserve my energy.
[49:05.81]Got some mixed seeds.
[49:07.29]Can I plant those?
[49:08.15]What if I plant those over here?
[49:12.73]What is that?
[49:15.05]Water it.
[49:18.99]Get this out of the way.
[49:19.79]Get this tree out of my view.
[49:25.43]This thing's seriously taking up my view.
[49:30.38]Nice.
[49:31.87]Oh, look at all that!
[49:32.71]That made such a great noise, too.
[49:39.15]Can I get rid of the stump here?
[49:43.84]Okay.
[49:45.38]Let's chill out for a second.
[49:46.56]I have this whole thing situated.
[49:48.52]Mr. Slin.
[49:49.62]The Mr. Slin.
[49:51.56]Hey, what's going on, dude?
[49:52.56]Welcome to the family, Mr. Slin!
[50:03.08]Let me think about this for a second.
[50:07.69]I don't want to just sell the wood.
[50:08.81]Can I sell the trash?
[50:11.79]Is he gonna be mad at me for doing this?
[50:15.13]That's the only thing I'm gonna leave in there.
[50:17.93]Yeah, I came to pick up your supplies and there was just a hunk of shit in the box.
[50:22.47]I ain't gonna come back and do this anymore if you keep doing that.
[50:28.11]Okay.
[50:28.63]Well, I found a daffodil.
[50:36.43]Um, let's go to town.
[50:37.89]It still wants me to... Water every day until the crop is ready for harvest.
[50:46.08]Well, I just have to kind of chill until I can do that.
[50:48.76]That's the first, like, tutorial.
[50:54.39]I might as well meet some more people while I have the energy to do so.
[50:56.89]Oh, hold on.
[50:59.35]We've got a... We've got a quest.
[51:07.19]fish help wanted jody is in need of a quartz where am I gonna get a quartz I'm scared to accept this because I don't know what okay I'll fine I'll take it where do we get a quartz oh I have two days where do you find quartz what even is quartz

[51:42.70]Yeah, Jodi would be real thankful when she doesn't get that delivery because I have no idea where to go to do it.
[51:53.99]Oh, whatever.
[51:54.29]I'm going to go.
[51:55.11]Have I even gone in here?
[51:59.15]Can I buy quartz from this guy?
[52:02.55]Backpack upgrade.
[52:03.71]Oh, that's cool.
[52:05.35]Don't have enough money.
[52:09.28]Uh, potato, oh, potato seeds, cauliflower.
[52:11.90]12 days.
[52:15.93]Parsnip, plant these in the spring, takes 10 days to mature, but keeps producing after that.
[52:23.80]Yields multiple beans per harvest.
[52:29.62]Maybe I should get cauliflower.
[52:36.62]Thank you for not arresting Jerma the Madman.
[52:43.16]I'm gonna get some cauliflower seeds.
[52:45.88]Inventory full.
[52:46.68]Well, here, take a daffodil.
[52:47.98]I don't fucking want this dumb thing.
[52:51.38]Take some sap, too.
[52:53.42]Give me some cauliflower.
[52:58.21]Do four.
[53:00.59]Tulip?
[53:02.65]Holy shit, there's a lot of stuff here.
[53:05.55]Sugar?
[53:09.19]Oil, there's a lot going on.
[53:10.83]Flooring?
[53:13.92]Six thousand, these are worth thousands.
[53:19.76]Can you make alcohol?
[53:25.18]New patch of grass.
[53:30.28]Oh, shit.
[53:31.88]No, I'm trying to put it back.
[53:33.02]Well, we're going to have some new grass.
[53:41.87]I don't want to run out of water.
[53:42.89]Where do you refill water?
[53:48.74]That's a question for the ages.
[53:51.28]This guy doesn't have it?
[53:55.26]Where's the well?
[54:03.70]Grasshopper is supposed to be good this year.
[54:05.66]That's the trash!
[54:14.36]I didn't want to water the trash can.
[54:16.00]I wanted to open up the trash can and take out the two-day-old burrito.
[54:21.90]Hey, happy birthday, by the way.
[54:23.37]How was your first night in the old cottage?
[54:27.75]Your grandpa used to complain about the rickety old bed, but I think deep down he actually loved that house.
[54:36.77]Go fuck yourself.
[54:37.61]I don't care.
[54:44.16]I'm going through people's trash.
[54:46.11]What a scumbag.
[54:48.19]Ooh!
[54:49.27]A pine cone.
[54:52.59]Uh... Hey, I'll... I can get a pine tree?
[54:59.22]Fuck.
[54:59.88]Here, take a rock.
[55:00.68]Alright, I'm good.
[55:03.82]Let's go.
[55:08.52]I don't want that rock.
[55:09.26]Who cares?
[55:09.68]Uh, I haven't gone over here
[55:15.33]Let's go explore up there.
[55:16.13]I haven't seen anything up there.
[55:22.41]I need a stash.
[55:29.05]Have I talked to you yet?
[55:31.03]I think so.
[55:32.15]I think I gave you.
[55:32.75]Was that the person I gave the trash to?
[55:33.88]I actually don't remember.
[55:41.52]Fuel your life.
[55:43.06]The Jojo Mart.
[55:43.81]Here we go.
[55:45.31]This is definitely where I can steal the car.
[55:46.81]It's just going to be Grand Theft Auto.
[55:53.23]Look at the supermarket.
[55:56.75]Wow.
[55:58.68]Silly sauce.
[55:59.36]I haven't talked to this guy yet.
[56:02.74]Shane's hard at work.
[56:03.48]He doesn't seem interested in talking.
[56:08.50]What a dick.
[56:19.22]Where's the water?
[56:25.49]Salt?
[56:27.85]Coconut meat?
[56:29.15]Mmm.
[56:30.19]Can I steal from the register?
[56:34.05]Hey kid, the name's Pam.
[56:39.77]Joja Cola.
[56:41.35]Cola Light.
[56:46.43]Well, you guys have the same shit.
[56:47.43]I don't want your stuff.
[56:51.47]I don't join clubs.
[56:51.97]I'm a lone wolf.
[56:52.45]Or something like that.
[56:53.29]Still need to do the quartz thing.
[57:15.42]I should go check out my parsnips.
[57:18.86]Get me out of here.
[57:19.38]I'm just walking around a grocery store.
[57:25.88]Cola's seven.
[57:26.46]Yeah, you can catch the cola for free.
[57:27.77]What are they talking about?
[57:28.57]There's a cola well north of town.
[57:39.21]I want to go up there.
[57:40.47]So we go to the road and then bang a right.
[57:44.69]Okay.
[57:48.14]Can I get there around here?
[57:54.06]I got plenty of energy.
[57:58.70]Can I get up there this way?
[58:03.14]I don't think so.
[58:03.66]I don't even want backpack slots.
[58:10.19]Is this game fun so far?
[58:12.75]Yeah, if you like doing tasks...
[58:18.02]Do you like doing... I don't want to say mundane tasks, but I do.
[58:23.57]Planting seeds and talking to people.
[58:26.95]Selling stuff.
[58:27.51]It's very relaxing.
[58:29.01]It's very much a relaxing experience.
[58:32.21]Oh, we got a weirdo up here.
[58:33.43]He's staring at the stars.
[58:36.19]Who are you?
[58:40.05]Upgrade house?
[58:42.10]Oh, man.
[58:44.52]This seems to be a lot to do in this game.
[58:51.71]You're not good enough friends with Sebastian to enter his bedroom.
[58:56.29]Look how creepy this looks.
[58:58.84]I'm sitting outside of this kid's bedroom.
[59:01.62]Staring.
[59:04.04]Come on, let me in your bedroom.
[59:06.38]I'm the new farmer.
[59:13.03]You're number 14 on my list.
[59:17.45]I'll get you later.
[59:24.37]There we go, we can go over here for mine.
[59:32.02]Straight up, it looks like.
[59:36.12]Oh, can I help you?
[59:37.16]Wrong.
[59:38.48]Where's the dynamite?
[59:47.07]What's that?
[59:50.35]Can I go the other way?
[59:52.36]Why am I blocked off here and I can't talk to this guy?
[60:00.94]Okay.
[60:03.30]Well.
[60:05.72]There's an old hermit over there.
[60:10.51]I'm going to get overwhelmed by this game.
[60:14.51]There's a million places to go.
[60:20.13]Can I even get up there right now?
[60:27.46]Well, okay.
[60:28.98]Can I cut this tree down?
[60:30.18]Am I going to get arrested?
[60:35.16]Who gives a shit?
[60:36.68]Come find me.
[60:43.40]Oh, for the love of God.
[60:46.97]I just wasted all that.
[60:52.35]Oh, shoot.
[60:55.53]Oh, more people.
[60:59.69]Hey.
[61:01.33]Greetings.
[61:01.89]I'm Dementus, local scientist and father.
[61:04.44]Thanks for introducing yourself.
[61:05.48]Yeah, you're very welcome.
[61:08.14]There he is.
[61:08.46]This is the computer kid.
[61:09.14]I told you I was gonna find you.
[61:13.20]Oh, you just moved in, right?
[61:14.22]Cool.
[61:15.16]Yeah.
[61:27.99]Alright.
[61:28.25]It was nice seeing you.
[61:37.22]Hello?
[61:37.68]Have you met everyone in town yet?
[61:40.30]That sounds exhausting.
[61:41.30]It is, Robin.
[61:42.18]It is very exhausting.
[61:45.66]Look, when I move into a new place, I don't have a list of people.
[61:48.76]I don't have to meet every single person and talk to them.
[61:52.62]People usually avoid their fucking neighbors.
[62:00.46]In fact, I would think the guy would be pretty weird if he were to be walking around talking to every single person, like walking up into their houses and trying to get them to have a conversation.
[62:11.05]Let's go home.
[62:12.53]I got more shit to do.
[62:15.19]Can't go that way.
[62:16.23]Fuck.
[62:20.28]Can I go this way?
[62:21.64]Yeah.
[62:23.76]I can plant my cauliflower seeds.
[62:27.82]That should be fun.
[62:37.08]And we are at my farm.
[62:46.16]Bus stop.
[62:47.58]So you can go to other towns.
[62:48.69]That's kind of cool.
[62:49.23]I have it live.
[62:53.23]It's only 9pm.
[62:54.95]The night is young.
[62:55.61]Let's clear some more shit up.
[63:05.98]Cut this tree down.
[63:07.13]Shake it.
[63:07.45]Make sure there's no birds in it.
[63:10.51]Okay.
[63:11.67]Be nice if you can hit it.
[63:19.67]This time it didn't go into water.
[63:25.02]Oh, shit.
[63:25.30]I'm losing stuff here.
[63:26.32]I gotta sell... Pinecone.
[63:28.84]Pinecone.
[63:31.02]I want this tree to be... Right here.
[63:40.39]I think.
[63:40.65]There's a bunch of stuff on the ground that I can't pick up.
[63:45.74]There we go.
[63:46.18]Sap.
[63:46.40]Okay, let's add some grass, right?
[63:50.84]Okay.
[63:56.82]Okay, you can take these.
[64:00.04]And take this.
[64:02.62]And that's all you can take for now.
[64:05.56]These should be ready to eat tomorrow.
[64:08.57]I'd be surprised if they weren't.
[64:10.33]Where do I want the cauliflower?
[64:11.63]How about right here?
[64:18.77]How many do I have?
[64:19.89]Four?
[64:20.97]Whoops.
[64:21.51]Too many.
[64:21.97]Too many spots.
[64:23.75]One, two, three, four.
[64:27.15]Get the can.
[64:32.29]Alright.
[64:32.57]It's time for bed.
[64:34.27]We're gonna wake up to a feast of parsnips tomorrow.
[64:44.78]Yeah, all serious farmers plant at 11 p.m.
[64:53.62]Sap times five.
[64:55.76]Trash.
[64:57.56]Only 15 gold?
[65:01.04]Alright, let's see.
[65:02.40]Let's have a feast.
[65:04.70]I'm gonna invite all my friends over.
[65:06.08]They're gonna be so... Fortune teller.
[65:14.38]I see a glimmer within my scrying orb, a shard of knowledge from the future.
[65:18.48]Spirits are very displeased today.
[65:20.02]They'll do their best to make your life difficult.
[65:22.12]Really?
[65:25.12]I don't like that very much.
[65:29.87]Hey, get the fuck out of here!
[65:31.85]Are you serious?
[65:34.45]What?
[65:36.07]He just took one of my... They're not ready?
[65:39.15]Are you kidding me?
[65:41.41]They're not ready to eat?
[65:45.01]bullshit and he took one and I'm gonna be out of water shit alright I need water can I fill it up right here yeah
[66:14.75]What even is this?
[66:19.85]How's my tree doing?
[66:22.37]Not good.
[66:22.79]Alright, let's smash some more stuff.
[66:31.13]Your axe isn't strong enough to break this stump.
[66:33.76]Oh, that's too bad.
[66:37.90]I'm like leaning forward.
[66:38.70]I've been leaning forward this whole time just peering in.
[66:46.97]We can get the swing.
[66:48.95]We can do the cleave.
[66:59.26]Okay.
[67:02.14]I wanted to make a little path here.
[67:04.95]Mail.
[67:06.43]Keep finding cool stuff.
[67:07.23]My backpack is full.
[67:08.47]Does this sound like you?
[67:09.25]Well, Pierre has got you covered.
[67:10.75]Stop by Pierre's General Store today and check out our affordable 24-size backpack.
[67:14.43]See you soon.
[67:17.34]To our value, George and my customers, our team members have removed the landslide caused by our drilling operation near the mountain lake.
[67:24.10]Okay.
[67:27.50]Oh, that's the... That's the... thing that was blocking the... Oh, shit.
[67:35.50]I think I ran out of time on this delivery.
[67:38.36]No, I can still do it.
[67:39.34]Let's go.
[67:42.26]Move, move, move.
[67:46.17]You gonna go shower for a bit?
[67:46.99]When I come back, I expect me to have a grown literal forest.
[67:50.93]I don't know if that's gonna happen, dude.
[67:52.98]It would be... It would be hard-pressed.
[67:55.34]Oh!
[67:55.76]It's his birthday?
[67:56.56]Did I forget it?
[67:58.22]I think I forgot it.
[68:01.70]Oh, hi there.
[68:02.28]You forgot my birthday.
[68:08.96]What an eyesore.
[68:13.63]What's wrong with it?
[68:14.53]It's dated.
[68:15.01]It's vintage.
[68:18.05]This is the Pelican Town Community Center, or what's left of it anyways.
[68:25.57]It used to be the pride and joy of the town, always bustling with activity.
[68:30.73]Well... Now just look at it, it's shameful.
[68:37.14]These days the young folk would rather sit in front of the TV than engage with the community.
[68:43.44]But listen to me, I sound like an old fool!
[68:47.75]JoJo Corporation has been hounding me to sell them the land so they can turn it into a warehouse.
[68:53.39]Pelican Town could use the money, but there's something stopping me from selling it.
[68:56.71]I guess old timers like me get attached to relics.
[68:58.57]Sell it.
[68:59.75]Sell it.
[69:00.51]Level it.
[69:01.51]And then put that money into our schools.
[69:05.17]You know what I mean?
[69:06.07]If anyone else buys a JoJo Co.
[69:09.21]membership, I'm just gonna go ahead and sell it.
[69:11.89]I say sell it, level it, build a school.
[69:15.57]Put that money into our schools.
[69:21.33]Oh no, I'm going to get... I'm going to get emotional when I go in here, I think.
[69:27.24]Yeah, I'm going to get... Oh, I'm getting emotional already.
[69:29.32]Don't sell it.
[69:30.62]Don't sell it.
[69:32.38]There's history here.
[69:33.92]Look at all this history.
[69:38.21]Vincent and Jazz must have been playing in here.
[69:42.05]This place is even more dilapidated than I remember.
[69:45.49]What the fuck is that?
[69:53.45]Okay, this is getting supernatural.
[69:54.51]I thought this was a farming game.
[69:59.03]Now I'm definitely selling it.
[70:01.49]This place is haunted.
[70:03.46]Wait a minute, but if I sell it, maybe the ghosts and the spirits will haunt me.
[70:09.04]I don't know.
[70:13.60]See, look behind you, old man.
[70:15.53]Oh, I don't see anything.
[70:16.39]You must be dreaming.
[70:22.93]You're worrying me, Greg.
[70:25.83]Look, I think I'm going to head home.
[70:27.50]I need some lunch.
[70:28.74]And you're really freaking me out.
[70:29.94]You need to go see a doctor.
[70:31.10]I'll keep this place unlocked from now on.
[70:35.22]Maybe you can help catch that rat.
[70:38.32]Let's catch him.
[70:40.88]Let's catch the rat.
[70:44.53]Come back and explore this building.
[70:45.87]I'm already here.
[70:46.39]I'll stay here and do it.
[70:49.67]Let's go.
[70:50.81]I got all the time in the world.
[70:53.29]Get your sword out.
[70:56.11]And let's lap that thing's head off.
[71:01.90]Hmm.
[71:02.82]Interesting.
[71:05.88]Oh, interesting.
[71:06.76]Look at this.
[71:07.18]A big safe.
[71:07.92]Any money?
[71:10.05]Any cash?
[71:13.53]Ah, what's down here?
[71:14.57]The old musty basement.
[71:16.53]What's that?
[71:17.33]An old stove.
[71:19.75]The plot thickens.
[71:24.59]Would you look at this over here?
[71:25.37]Oh, there's a bulletin board.
[71:26.23]Ah, just like they used to put up on the school board.
[71:28.33]Ooh.
[71:29.41]Old fish tank.
[71:30.01]Can I take these?
[71:33.99]Can I plant in here?
[71:36.61]Can I turn this place into... Can I take this place over with foliage?
[71:39.65]What's this?
[71:43.40]Can't do anything with this stuff.
[71:44.72]Look it.
[71:45.06]There he is.
[71:46.72]Weapons ready, boys.
[71:49.42]Weapons are ready.
[71:59.16]There's an alien.
[71:59.80]There's an alien language.
[72:05.46]What does that mean?
[72:06.16]Put a rock on him?
[72:09.02]No.
[72:09.32]Okay.
[72:09.58]Well, whatever.
[72:09.90]Let's go.
[72:16.10]Alright.
[72:16.60]So remember, note to self, there is an alien language in here.
[72:20.78]There's an alien village or something from 20,000 years ago.
[72:27.03]Cool.
[72:27.49]Did I look up here?
[72:28.51]Not really, but whatever.
[72:29.59]I'm wasting time.
[72:33.35]Let's go.
[72:34.27]Any dogs in here?
[72:35.54]No.
[72:40.80]So where am I right now?
[72:41.74]Right here?
[72:45.80]If I go right, I can go straight up.
[72:48.75]That should be cleared, right?
[72:49.81]The mine is cleared now?
[72:52.01]From my understanding.
[72:55.35]No, I don't want the daffodil.
[72:56.35]I already have no room.
[73:02.49]It's on to the mine.
[73:06.17]What is the little house inside the house?
[73:08.07]Yeah, I know, really.
[73:09.84]Watch out.
[73:11.26]It's the deranged old man.
[73:12.42]A stranger.
[73:15.10]Hello.
[73:22.72]This doesn't really do much for me.
[73:25.85]Oh, you guys want expensive stuff.
[73:27.14]I remember the good old days when people would accept rocks and like them.
[73:33.34]So there's the mine.
[73:34.04]I gotta do this now.
[73:37.82]Before I lose.
[73:38.74]There's a lot of people in this game.
[73:44.23]Hmm.
[73:44.35]This guy's got a cape.
[73:51.97]We're just peering down into this old mine shaft.
[73:53.98]It's been abandoned for decades.
[73:57.87]Still, there's probably good ore down there, like quartz.
[74:01.61]But a dark place undisturbed for so long, I'm afraid ore isn't the only thing you'll find.
[74:05.37]Monsters, okay.
[74:08.13]Take this, you might need it.
[74:09.71]Gun.
[74:12.67]You actually do have a weapon.
[74:16.01]Take my trusty gun.
[74:17.01]My name's Marlin, by the way.
[74:20.42]I run the Adventurers Guild right outside.
[74:23.30]I'll keep an eye on you.
[74:25.00]Prove yourself, and I might think about making you a member.
[74:28.06]But he wants you to be a member.
[74:33.76]Well, now I have this.
[74:34.50]Your pickaxe isn't strong enough to break this yet.
[74:41.62]Okay.
[74:42.98]Well, I guess I'm just going to go down.
[74:48.91]Where are the enemies?
[74:53.95]I guess there are none here at the moment.
[74:55.27]Let's stop breaking stuff.
[74:57.03]Quartz.
[74:58.13]Look at the quartz.
[75:01.13]Stone.
[75:01.59]Ooh, another way to go down.
[75:07.56]Geodude.
[75:10.02]You received a Geodude.
[75:15.14]Can I just throw this crap down?
[75:16.99]Why do we still have parsnip seeds?
[75:21.05]What the hell am I doing with these?
[75:28.83]Is that a quartz?
[75:31.44]Just get this... Just throw this shit out of here.
[75:35.38]How do I throw it away?
[75:40.32]How do I just get to my inventory?
[75:41.52]There it is.
[75:48.44]I don't care about that.
[75:49.94]No, I don't want to pick it up.
[75:51.40]Throw it away.
[75:54.68]Copper ore.
[75:57.25]Well, I'm getting a lot of interesting things.
[76:00.21]I actually have a health bar now.
[76:12.83]Come on, give me a quartz.
[76:18.49]Where's the shiny quartz?
[76:21.51]It's coal, I think.
[76:25.55]I smashed up this whole damn place.
[76:32.01]Hold on.
[76:34.85]Uh... Get rid of... Fuck, I can't really get rid of... Is that quartz on the ground right now?
[76:44.23]I just want to see.
[76:45.49]I'm just curious.
[76:46.65]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[76:49.29]No, it's coal.
[76:51.07]Forget about the coal.
[76:51.73]The copper's probably worth more.
[76:53.05]Let's go down.
[76:57.20]Here are the little slimy guys.
[76:58.24]Ooh!
[77:02.68]Ooh, they dash!
[77:07.43]Turn the other way and fight!
[77:14.13]These little slimes are giving me such a pain in the ass.
[77:16.03]Kill them!
[77:17.41]Are you serious?
[77:20.02]I didn't expect the enemies to... That's definitely a quartz.
[77:24.40]Get rid of this thing.
[77:25.04]Throw it down.
[77:30.82]No, it's a slime.
[77:33.32]Monster loot.
[77:39.53]What do I have here that I can just throw on the ground and not care about?
[77:42.13]That's the question at hand.
[77:50.65]I should have cleaned up my inventory before coming down here.
[77:53.29]That was a mistake.
[78:00.75]I'm not gonna die.
[78:01.61]I'm gonna be alive for a very long time, don't worry.
[78:06.25]I'm gonna sell all this shit to Grandpa.
[78:16.75]Okay, that looks like... that looks a little different to me.
[78:24.44]But I need to get rid of... something.
[78:32.24]Does that look quirky to you guys?
[78:38.06]Looks quirky to me.
[78:43.56]Come on, do your dash.
[78:52.28]Oh my god, where is my better weapon?
[78:55.40]These things take forever to kill.
[78:56.72]These things take so long to kill.
[79:04.34]Should I throw down the dragon egg?
[79:05.42]I don't know.
[79:11.19]What about parsnip seeds?
[79:12.21]Who gives a shit?
[79:12.91]I just want to see what happens.
[79:17.59]This is copper.
[79:18.43]It's all copper.
[79:21.07]Damn it.
[79:28.53]Let's kill the flying bug.
[79:30.43]He died in one hit.
[79:32.46]That guy dies in one hit.
[79:35.61]Do the slimes die in like 40?
[79:44.24]Copper?
[79:46.54]Bug meat.
[79:49.04]No.
[79:50.58]Copper's probably worth more.
[79:52.70]I gotta get out of here.
[79:53.44]I gotta come back tomorrow.
[79:56.58]I'm out of energy.
[79:58.38]Yeah, let's go.
[79:59.18]I'll come back tomorrow.
[80:05.17]Get rid of your slime.
[80:07.77]Should I... Can you eat it?
[80:08.89]No, you can't eat it.
[80:14.57]Oh, the bug meat!
[80:15.84]Maybe I can eat the bug meat.
[80:18.92]Let's eat the bug meat.
[80:23.80]No, I can't eat the bug meat either.
[80:25.18]Uh...
[80:34.94]Organize.
[80:36.74]That's probably a little bit better.
[80:40.16]Social is the map.
[80:42.68]Crafting.
[80:43.26]I mean, can I break these down?
[80:45.68]50 wood.
[80:52.13]I mean, I don't want a wood path, gravel path.
[80:54.49]I'll do that later.
[80:58.29]I'll come back.
[81:00.12]We'll take the bug meat over the slime.
[81:06.08]I didn't get the quartz.
[81:06.86]I failed the mission.
[81:08.76]Unless it's like, can I get one more swing on one of these?
[81:10.74]Whatever.
[81:16.75]Let's go.
[81:18.93]It's not going anywhere.
[81:21.79]There's plenty more copper up here.
[81:25.83]Let's go.
[81:32.14]Can I go in the cart?
[81:34.50]Oh, it's out of order.
[81:38.15]Nothing works in this mine.
[81:39.11]Well, at least I have a lot of things to sell now, even though I can do things with them, probably.
[81:48.36]Bars, I can make bars.
[81:54.93]I can wrap all the way around, can't I?
[82:01.03]Go...
[82:08.71]Ashley, do you like my Charlie Brown duck?
[82:18.12]I had a lot of fun making this one.
[82:28.55]Down and around.
[82:29.45]Let's go home.
[82:31.05]When have I got my car?
[82:32.52]So I can just speed by this.
[82:42.74]Are these cows sleeping?
[82:45.02]Hey, cows.
[82:50.14]Who lives in there?
[82:52.24]Who lives in there?
[82:58.64]Oh, shit.
[83:01.04]What?
[83:05.11]How did I go the wrong way?
[83:06.59]Isn't it, like, right there?
[83:09.49]Oh, my fuck.
[83:13.30]I thought I could just walk up, but apparently not.
[83:17.28]It's time to pass out.
[83:18.26]Let's pass out.
[83:19.43]Pass out.
[83:20.37]Pass out.
[83:24.51]That's why you clear the farm so you can do that?
[83:26.23]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[83:27.51]Yeah, I want to drive a bulldozer.
[83:41.86]Can't go that way.
[83:46.84]I can go this way, though.
[83:48.19]Hey, look at that.
[83:57.70]I'm not going to pass out.
[83:58.42]I'm not that tired yet.
[84:02.17]It's 11 o'clock.
[84:06.01]Alright.
[84:07.71]It's time to throw some of these things in here.
[84:11.89]Throw that in there.
[84:13.65]I think I'm going to hold on to this.
[84:15.46]Blacksmith can break this.
[84:16.40]No, I need money.
[84:17.50]Who cares?
[84:19.18]I don't care how bad of an idea this is.
[84:20.68]There's wood and stone everywhere.
[84:22.30]Give me money.
[84:24.48]Give me money, Grandpa.
[84:26.36]I don't care if I just did something really dumb.
[84:27.95]I need hundreds of thousands of dollars right now.
[84:35.09]Wow, that's worth a lot.
[84:41.75]Wait, the stone is not worth?
[84:43.18]Are you serious?
[84:47.66]That's not worth anything?
[84:51.02]Well, at least I can... There we go.
[84:53.38]I finally can pull up my stuff.
[84:57.36]Hi, Clint.
[85:00.00]I'm breaking some rocks open and finding ore.
[85:01.92]That's good.
[85:07.31]Thanks for telling me.
[85:08.45]Thanks a lot, Clint.
[85:09.21]Thanks for letting me know this.
[85:11.35]After I threw it all in the trash.
[85:15.21]X just said, hey, by the way, I noticed.
[85:17.45]I looked in your trash and I saw that you threw away a bunch of valuable stones.
[85:21.58]Hey, I took them, by the way.
[85:23.00]They're mine now.
[85:24.26]But here, let me tell you that you can use them.
[85:27.94]Break.
[85:32.26]Learned how to craft a furnace.
[85:34.04]Excellent.
[85:37.40]Smelt metal bars, the bars can be used for crafting, construction, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[85:43.28]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[85:47.51]Racnir.
[85:49.43]Welcome, thanks for subscribing.
[85:50.45]Enjoy your stay.
[85:54.91]When you smelted a few copper bars, consider having me upgrade one of your tools.
[85:58.15]It can make your work a lot easier.
[85:59.49]I just got like fucking ten of them!
[86:02.15]Where were you yesterday?
[86:05.29]Where were you yesterday?
[86:11.11]Explore the mine.
[86:12.45]Reach level 5 in the mines.
[86:15.29]And if you're going to keep mining, you should build a furnace.
[86:17.23]Craft a furnace.
[86:19.13]Okie dokie, but first I have to do this.
[86:22.13]Parsnip.
[86:23.01]Yeah!
[86:25.90]100 gold!
[86:28.70]Let's go.
[86:28.98]Let's get them all.
[86:29.94]I can't wait to eat these.
[86:35.30]Nice.
[86:36.48]Oh, that was so much fun.
[86:37.46]That was so much fun doing that.
[86:39.10]Wait, what does that mean?
[86:41.84]Why is there a star next to this one?
[86:45.02]Is this an elite parsnip?
[86:50.84]Wow, okay, that's cool.
[86:51.86]So there's different varying qualities?
[86:55.67]Interesting.
[87:00.91]I still don't know what this is.
[87:01.87]That's my tree.
[87:04.67]Not doing so well.
[87:09.08]My sources tell me you've been poking around inside the old community center.
[87:12.24]Why don't you pay me a visit?
[87:13.98]My chambers are west of the forest lake in the stone tower.
[87:18.70]Okay, well that's the guy.
[87:19.82]I know who that is.
[87:20.52]Let's rearrange my house for a second.
[87:26.83]I want the fireplace.
[87:28.97]I want to be able to watch TV.
[87:29.95]You know what I mean?
[87:37.16]So I can just I just want to be lying in bed with the TV on with my eyes upside down.
[87:43.93]This needs to be over here.
[87:48.91]There.
[87:49.17]And then carpet goes over here in front so you can wipe your feet on it.
[87:56.74]Plant goes right underneath the painting.
[88:03.57]That's much better.
[88:09.47]No, I can't even sit down at this table.
[88:12.23]There.
[88:14.17]Alright, much better house.
[88:19.54]Fortune teller.
[88:22.54]A new viewer has joined us.
[88:24.44]Somebody else is watching the Twitch stream.
[88:28.14]Spirits feel neutral today.
[88:29.54]The day is in your hands.
[88:30.64]Okay, let's go.
[88:32.62]I've got to buy some more stuff.
[88:38.00]Now, can I...
[88:40.65]plant some of these?
[88:42.17]What are you supposed to do with these now?
[88:44.51]Sell them?
[88:46.87]Do I go to the town and sell these?
[88:49.51]Or do I eat them?
[88:52.71]Is the world just my oyster?
[88:53.71]Can I do whatever I want?
[88:54.63]Alright, well, let's find out.
[88:58.55]I need to make a furnace.
[89:05.99]Where's the crafting...
[89:09.44]furnace is 20 copper ore and 25 stone so I need to go back to the chest yeah I want to build one of these I want a chest because there's some items here that I don't care about let's let's get let's just let's go for an adventure of getting items you know what I'm saying I'm gonna get a bunch of wood and a bunch of stone
[89:38.76]I need a bunch of wood.
[89:39.74]And a bunch of stone.
[89:46.22]That works.
[89:47.98]I'll probably get it here.
[89:51.81]I wouldn't be surprised if I get it all here.
[90:02.21]Timber!
[90:02.59]24.
[90:02.61]I need 50.
[90:16.02]Almost there.
[90:21.61]Wrong tool.
[90:28.67]I can clear down here, right?
[90:29.80]Because that's where the lake is.
[90:31.40]Let's take a look.
[90:40.04]So where are we now?
[90:44.78]The lake is down there.
[90:46.29]Well, here's a lot of stone.
[90:47.19]I can work on this.
[90:48.45]I feel so accomplished right now.
[90:52.89]Oh, what?
[90:54.93]Come on.
[90:57.63]There's another Geodude.
[91:06.78]Now, I want to make the wood thing first.
[91:08.88]We'll do the wood first.
[91:09.70]Because I'm closer to making a chest than I am a furnace.
[91:17.67]You can have a huge farm.
[91:23.12]Almost there.
[91:23.56]One more tree and I'm going to go make the chest.
[91:24.98]And put some of these items that I'm not using right now in it.
[91:35.36]Alright, let's make a chest.
[91:36.30]It's going to go in the house.
[91:38.84]Don't step on the crops, you'll ruin them.
[91:43.62]Crafting.
[91:44.62]Chest.
[91:46.62]And...
[91:49.40]Put it there.
[91:49.86]Whatever.
[91:50.22]Put those on the ground for now.
[91:52.10]We can go right here.
[91:59.51]There we go.
[92:01.79]Hey!
[92:02.37]A chest!
[92:04.03]Finally, I can put the fishing pole... I can put... I'm gonna save these.
[92:10.79]Do these go bad?
[92:11.43]Will these go rotten in a few days if I don't eat them or something?
[92:16.78]Put the sword in there.
[92:17.62]I'm not doing anything with the sword right now.
[92:19.38]Not doing anything with the hoe.
[92:25.69]These are the three tools I need.
[92:27.09]Okay.
[92:29.25]Hopefully those don't go rotten.
[92:30.87]I like the music.
[92:39.59]So now I need to cut down... I need to make a furnace.
[92:48.11]Okay.
[92:48.27]Raising animals?
[92:49.83]Are you serious?
[92:50.63]Go be the wizard!
[93:18.13]okay let's do some stone I need how many stone 25 stone what's my energy like well let's here's what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna get the stone here please attack the thing I want to attack well here's the lake right
[93:49.01]Now I have a way to come up from the lake.
[93:51.53]Which is a good thing.
[94:01.29]Make sure I actually have a way to move.
[94:03.14]If I come up from here, I can go this way.
[94:06.60]Yada yada yada.
[94:09.06]And here's my farm.
[94:10.66]Okay.
[94:12.06]I've cleared it.
[94:12.56]I have clearance.
[94:20.89]Do I care about anything else?
[94:22.78]What is this?
[94:23.22]It's a tiny little tree.
[94:24.02]Look at this tiny tree.
[94:32.42]Sixteen.
[94:33.02]I'm almost out of energy, though.
[94:36.42]I'm going... You know, screw it.
[94:38.47]I'm selling these.
[94:39.87]I'm gonna go and I'm gonna sell them.
[94:40.97]Let me see how much I can get for them.
[94:43.85]And we're gonna take the sap, too.
[94:44.95]I'm gonna sell all this shit.
[94:48.57]I need money.
[94:51.71]I need cash, man.
[94:56.61]I better get enough to be able to buy something cool.
[95:05.98]That's a pond.
[95:06.60]Oh, I'm gonna get the rabbit.
[95:10.40]Can I shake the bush?
[95:12.04]Come on, where is he?
[95:13.14]He was just in here.
[95:13.84]Oh, well.
[95:19.86]Help wanted.
[95:20.26]I need a smallmouth bass for a soup I'm making.
[95:27.91]I don't know if I want to fish right now.
[95:29.21]Let's just see how much I get for this.
[95:30.45]43 gold.
[95:35.55]350 for 10.
[95:35.95]50 for 25.
[95:36.23]Come on.
[95:37.04]Your price is a little steep here, man.
[95:51.97]Will I get a better deal if I go to somebody else or if I put them in the box?
[95:54.50]I don't know.
[96:00.36]Maybe I'll just sell these ones and the sap and I'll just keep the super one.
[96:03.40]I can buy some other seeds too.
[96:11.74]Well, I should probably buy seeds.
[96:19.67]I'm going to buy more.
[96:24.52]Let's get rid of these.
[96:27.48]Buy a bunch of seeds.
[96:33.29]And replant them.
[96:40.99]That was $3.50 for those.
[96:42.38]If I put these in the box, I wonder how much they're worth.
[96:50.52]We're going to box it up.
[96:53.76]And just see what we get for it.
[96:56.52]If it's any worse.
[96:57.12]Did I talk to you yet?
[96:57.72]I think I did.
[97:05.03]This game is so... I feel like I'm not accomplishing anything, but I'm accomplishing things.
[97:11.03]Okay, whatever you say.
[97:15.97]Like, I feel like I'm not doing anything, but I'm doing things.
[97:19.16]I'm getting things done.
[97:22.11]Actually, let me take a look at this.
[97:23.33]Let me talk to the farm person.
[97:25.75]This place is big and confusing.
[97:31.68]What?
[97:34.18]How are you going to let me in if I can't even talk to you?
[97:39.22]Can I go in this kid's room?
[97:41.59]No.
[97:43.45]Fine.
[97:48.11]Well, screw it.
[97:48.69]Let's just go home.
[97:50.09]I want to put these in the box.
[97:56.12]That's the whole experience.
[97:58.43]You know what kind it is.
[98:03.33]You are right.
[98:06.33]I should have chopped the door down with the axe.
[98:09.33]Am I Jack Nicholson?
[98:11.75]Okay, here we go.
[98:12.75]It was $3.50 to sell them to the shopkeeper.
[98:16.60]We're going to take our chances with Grandpa.
[98:19.74]I'm not going to sell this one.
[98:24.40]So where was that blacksmith?
[98:27.81]He said he could do stuff, right?
[98:29.27]Let's plant these.
[98:39.22]And water them up.
[98:44.10]This farm is such a piece of shit right now.
[98:45.82]Remember, you have to start somewhere.
[98:49.48]My grandfather started with parsnips and he moved on to carrots within three weeks.
[98:55.03]Need to build a furnace.
[98:56.37]Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
[98:58.70]What's going on with this tree?
[98:59.68]Did I screw something up here?
[99:00.72]This really is not... Oh, fuck.
[99:10.31]Oops.
[99:14.03]I'm kind of out of energy.
[99:14.89]I'll fish for a little bit.
[99:20.10]Give me my rod.
[99:24.76]I'll put my prize possession in here for now.
[99:31.93]Don't step on the plants.
[99:33.19]I'll try not to.
[99:35.39]I don't want to kill everything.
[99:37.65]I'm going to get the big mouth bass and I can walk right over to the guy and give it to him.
[99:49.72]Let's go, baby.
[99:54.93]Can you die?
[99:55.47]Yeah, you can.
[99:57.23]There is a zero health.
[99:59.29]I actually don't know what happens, but you can get to zero HP.
[100:03.40]I don't know what it means.
[100:04.16]I'm sure you have to pay that company, like, money.
[100:06.16]I thought that was a spider.
[100:14.66]Go.
[100:21.53]What the hell?
[100:24.09]Stop giving me crap.
[100:27.40]I need a big mouth bass.
[100:29.40]Fuck.
[100:33.01]No, I'm getting tired.
[100:33.69]I'm getting tired.
[100:34.55]I don't want to get tired.
[100:42.21]Come on.
[100:44.73]Where's the big mouth bass?
[100:47.83]Another piece of fucking driftwood.
[100:53.51]If you die, it's game over.
[100:54.79]Save.
[100:55.11]Deleted.
[100:55.47]That would suck.
[101:04.45]It's getting late.
[101:07.59]Broken CD?
[101:09.67]It's a Jojenet 2.0 trial CD.
[101:11.51]They must have made a billion of these things.
[101:13.05]Okay, I better get back.
[101:17.60]I gotta get in my bed.
[101:19.00]It's getting to be bedtime.
[101:21.64]More broken CDs.
[101:22.50]Well, maybe Grandpa will want these.
[101:28.82]Catch a Red Volk?
[101:32.97]Why would there be a bass in a lake and not a river or the ocean?
[101:35.71]That's a good point.
[101:39.99]I'm talking about my pond outside of my front door.
[101:44.49]It definitely does not have bass.
[101:47.60]But we're gonna get rid of these glasses.
[101:52.27]Here.
[101:54.03]Take the CDs too.
[101:56.25]Alright, moment of truth.
[101:57.67]How much were those parsnips worth if I put them in the box rather than go to town and sell them?
[102:04.20]We shall see.
[102:04.78]Alright, come on.
[102:09.06]Big money.
[102:09.94]Big money.
[102:11.46]What happened?
[102:13.73]Trees sometimes drop seeds plus one axe proficiency?
[102:16.71]New crafting.
[102:17.47]Wild seeds.
[102:18.33]New crafting.
[102:19.37]Field snack.
[102:21.02]Oh, I can make a Snickers bar.
[102:23.44]Level one mining plus one pickaxe.
[102:25.64]Cherry bomb.
[102:26.46]Ooh.
[102:30.22]Alright, same exact price.
[102:32.98]So no matter if you put them in the box or you don't put them in the box, it's the same price.
[102:39.51]So, whatever.
[102:39.95]I was hoping Grandpa would give me the family discount.
[102:49.01]Well, now I have some money to play with.
[102:51.97]I'm just gonna go blow it at the casino.
[102:54.45]Is there a casino in this game?
[102:57.27]I'm putting $640 on red.
[102:58.37]Okay.
[103:03.51]I'll take this with me.
[103:05.59]Take the sword.
[103:07.09]Put this shit in here.
[103:10.91]I'll keep the watering can.
[103:13.39]Okie dokie.
[103:14.77]Let's water my plants and let's go back into the cave and fight the monsters.
[103:26.94]Did somebody tell me not to step on them?
[103:30.52]Probably shouldn't be doing that.
[103:34.49]That has taken so long to grow.
[103:36.47]What is that thing?
[103:40.89]These have taken a long time, too.
[103:42.03]Where's my fertilizer?
[103:43.45]Is there something wrong with these?
[103:48.53]Fill it up.
[103:55.67]Okay, everything's watered.
[103:56.65]Get my sword out.
[103:59.35]I have this in case I need to eat it.
[104:03.93]Let's go get some stone and some copper so we can make a furnace.
[104:11.78]Sounds like a plant.
[104:15.27]I have to tenderize the plants with my feet.
[104:20.92]Just stomp all over them.
[104:22.96]Now, what do these things mean?
[104:24.66]These little, like, holes I see in the ground.
[104:26.22]I feel like these can... I can uproot these or something, somehow.
[104:31.71]They're all over the place.
[104:34.25]Whatever.
[104:34.51]Uh, I'm gonna go up and around.
[104:42.99]Oh, I gotta, like... I gotta get a better posture.
[104:45.57]Oh, look at this!
[104:46.51]Is this purified water?
[104:50.79]Well, I'm going to dump my dirty pond water in it.
[104:52.66]Infect the whole town.
[104:55.30]You know what?
[104:58.98]I will take these.
[104:59.60]I feel like I can do something with these, and I'm not doing anything with them.
[105:06.58]He loved the casino.
[105:07.48]There actually was a casino in Harvest Moon.
[105:09.32]I hope there's one in this.
[105:10.44]I can't wait to play it.
[105:12.16]I can't wait to blow all my money.
[105:13.24]It's going to be fantastic.
[105:19.80]Shake the tree.
[105:22.06]What?
[105:23.78]I don't block the tree.
[105:24.88]Shake it.
[105:28.15]That's a pretty tree.
[105:28.85]I don't want to cut that one down.
[105:34.53]Up and to the right.
[105:40.58]Is that going to leave me there?
[105:43.16]Yeah.
[105:47.18]There's Harry the Hermit.
[105:53.58]What the hell is this thing?
[105:57.86]What is that?
[105:59.14]This game's fun!
[106:05.26]What a fun little game!
[106:10.04]Back to the depths.
[106:11.00]Let's do it.
[106:11.47]Okay, I can... I can afford to do this.
[106:21.71]Just need stone and I need copper.
[106:24.45]Well, I should be breaking the red ones, right?
[106:27.66]The ones with the little crystals in it, the red crystals.
[106:31.66]But I do need stone, too.
[106:42.53]Where's the... There it is, copper.
[106:45.33]Maybe 25 of each, right?
[106:50.02]That shouldn't have missed.
[106:54.04]I'm just gonna go down.
[106:57.64]Okay.
[106:59.08]Watch out for the slimes.
[107:05.20]Yeah, go ahead.
[107:06.08]Do a dash again.
[107:07.18]You little shit.
[107:10.15]There's your slime goo.
[107:19.07]What is that?
[107:21.61]Is there a monster in there?
[107:22.33]Is Oscar the Grouch gonna come out of that?
[107:29.20]I really thought that was gonna kill me.
[107:31.60]Cave carrot.
[107:32.58]Don't want that.
[107:34.32]Can I plant that?
[107:35.00]I wonder.
[107:40.24]I wonder.
[107:53.63]Okie dokie.
[107:58.24]Looking for the ones with the crystals in it.
[108:00.46]I don't want to lose exhaustion here.
[108:08.34]Let's keep going.
[108:12.80]There we go.
[108:13.14]Here's some discolored rocks.
[108:16.70]There's one down there.
[108:17.54]Yeah, there we go.
[108:26.33]Really?
[108:26.57]I just walked into that?
[108:27.79]Hey, I'm getting bug meat, guys.
[108:33.19]That bug meat was worth more than planting.
[108:37.82]If I picked up two pieces of bug meat, that's worth more than me spending five days planting parsnips.
[108:44.26]I'll just hang out down here.
[108:45.12]I'll be the fucking cave dweller.
[108:57.22]No bug meat?
[108:58.30]Aw.
[108:59.86]Whoa!
[109:01.60]That's not an actual rock.
[109:05.90]He makes a cool noise when you hit him.
[109:07.04]Anything?
[109:16.63]Okay.
[109:18.31]Ooh, what's that?
[109:22.33]And look at all this stuff.
[109:23.03]I don't even know what it is.
[109:25.29]I'm gonna eat it.
[109:25.71]I'm gonna eat this.
[109:29.77]Give me some more energy.
[109:31.39]Nice.
[109:31.79]Okay, now I can pick up.
[109:35.14]Get rid of this slime.
[109:37.04]Slime is useless to me right now.
[109:40.32]What is this?
[109:41.94]Topaz!
[109:44.04]Ooh.
[109:46.90]Fucking daffodils.
[109:47.74]Get rid of these, too.
[109:53.54]Amethyst?
[109:54.00]These are definitely worth more than daffodils.
[109:57.94]Shit, I shouldn't have brought that.
[109:59.52]Can I- should I just eat the fucking dirty carrot?
[110:03.17]Yeah.
[110:05.81]It's just a snack, right?
[110:06.81]Let's eat it.
[110:09.87]And we got hardwood.
[110:13.15]Special kind of wood with superior strength and beauty.
[110:17.86]Okay, well.
[110:19.34]We're down here for a reason.
[110:22.38]Specific reason.
[110:23.06]I need copper.
[110:23.38]Copper.
[110:29.76]Lock him in.
[110:30.24]Lock him in.
[110:30.68]He's just completely locked in.
[110:34.20]You get stuck like that again, dummy.
[110:41.23]Hopefully there's more copper up here.
[110:45.39]Ooh.
[110:51.05]Four.
[110:53.75]What's with these two ways to go down?
[111:03.08]There's a lot of stuff here.
[111:03.90]Hopefully I can sell that for something.
[111:07.50]Oh, what is that?
[111:08.00]I don't know.
[111:09.85]Alright, I have enough stone, right?
[111:18.05]It's 25.
[111:23.86]Shit, ow.
[111:29.66]Look the right way, please, when you attack.
[111:39.30]Ooh, what's that?
[111:41.28]I gotta go buy the extra backpack.
[111:43.82]Seriously, I'm out of room at all times.
[111:45.90]I don't know why I brought all this junk with me.
[111:49.93]Get rid of the dinosaur egg for a second.
[111:51.27]What is this?
[111:51.65]Cherry bomb.
[111:52.13]We're just gonna use it.
[111:55.25]Fuck it, I'm throwing it over here.
[111:56.17]Okay, that did... That was a lot.
[112:05.26]I did not expect it to do that much.
[112:12.63]Bug meat.
[112:14.09]Ladies and gentlemen, we found some bug meat.
[112:22.17]I'm gonna pick this up.
[112:28.64]I just... I need more room!
[112:31.44]I need more of everything.
[112:42.56]No, throw this away.
[112:45.68]Oh my goodness, will you fucking throw it away and just leave it away?
[112:48.06]Hey, there's the quartz.
[112:52.69]Found it.
[112:53.03]I wonder if I can sell it for a lot.
[113:06.53]No, that's worth a lot though.
[113:08.32]I don't know how much this stuff is worth.
[113:14.50]I could drop this, but I don't even know what this does.
[113:24.24]Have I been drinking again?
[113:25.30]I'm drinking a coffee right now.
[113:28.98]Total earnings, 920 gold.
[113:29.64]Well, we're going to...
[113:42.03]Throw this down because I want the bug meat.
[113:44.07]The bug meat is a guaranteed 200 plus gold.
[113:48.41]And now I'm just going copper hunting.
[113:50.01]You know what I'm saying?
[113:52.70]If I can get more bug meat then.
[113:54.48]Hell yeah.
[113:56.00]But we're not going for it.
[113:58.10]We're going for copper.
[113:58.90]Because I can get stone really easily.
[114:02.08]Bug meat.
[114:03.63]That's like 500 gold.
[114:08.17]I could throw the tools away but how much is it for a tool?
[114:10.31]Are they expensive?
[114:14.70]There's copper down here.
[114:20.68]That's a crit.
[114:21.54]You can tell because of the yellow number.
[114:24.98]I don't even know what any of this shit is.
[114:30.77]Do the mission at hand.
[114:32.41]I can always come back down here.
[114:34.67]I need 25 copper.
[114:40.27]Forget about everything else.
[114:41.39]Even if it's something important.
[114:42.39]I can always come back.
[114:46.16]I have plenty of time.
[114:54.12]Shit.
[114:59.84]Any more?
[115:00.26]I don't want to... I don't want to fuck with those guys right now.
[115:04.90]Just go down again.
[115:08.39]Where was it?
[115:08.75]Over here?
[115:09.61]Right here.
[115:14.75]Well, there's the...
[115:17.75]Reach level 40.
[115:23.05]Yikes.
[115:23.99]Okay.
[115:26.42]The elevator works now?
[115:27.18]I just want to test it.
[115:33.54]That's cool.
[115:35.80]So this is the ARPG version of the game.
[115:40.15]Where... It reminds me of Fate.
[115:42.71]You guys remember Fate?
[115:49.57]Alright, we're on the quest for copper.
[115:51.49]That's the only thing we want to do here right now.
[115:54.87]No copper, no thank you.
[115:59.34]Shit.
[116:02.50]There is no copper here right now.
[116:07.66]So now I have to find the way to go down.
[116:13.08]Underneath one of these rocks.
[116:18.83]Another couple batches.
[116:20.26]I should be good to go.
[116:22.80]Come on.
[116:23.12]Where is it?
[116:27.96]Don't want to run out of energy either.
[116:32.14]Oh, shit.
[116:32.56]It's 11 o'clock.
[116:34.38]It's like 10.30.
[116:35.02]Uh-oh.
[116:36.84]Uh-oh.
[116:41.20]I need to go further.
[116:42.24]One more.
[116:42.85]One more.
[116:43.47]One more.
[116:43.81]It's okay.
[116:44.13]Even if it's going to be like 1 in the morning.
[116:45.51]I've got plenty of
[116:48.43]Shit, I have to go home.
[116:50.41]I have to go home.
[116:51.59]I do.
[116:53.29]I can't pretend like that's going to happen.
[116:57.58]Am I going to put my unedited streams up on YouTube?
[117:00.18]Nope.
[117:01.34]I am not going to do that.
[117:04.52]You can watch the VODs on Twitch.
[117:06.24]It's the full uninterrupted... What is this?
[117:14.11]I already have one of those.
[117:18.93]That looked like a pearl.
[117:19.69]I thought that was like a diamond.
[117:22.80]Oh, shit.
[117:23.56]Okay, we gotta go, go, go, go, go, get out of here.
[117:26.32]No, no, no, no.
[117:28.26]I can't tell what isn't a wall right now.
[117:37.77]VODs disappear in 60 days.
[117:41.25]That is true.
[117:43.86]But...
[117:45.95]I mean, a couple of months I think is long enough time to watch it if you wanted to, right?
[117:52.35]Unless like something really interesting was happening.
[117:55.93]Because my YouTube channel is mostly for edited stuff.
[118:02.03]At this point, I would say.
[118:06.30]Is there anything else?
[118:07.24]Can you do anything at night?
[118:09.28]Is there something specific I can do at night?
[118:14.12]I'm sure there is.
[118:18.31]I'm going to pass out again.
[118:19.21]Are they going to take money out of my fucking bank account?
[118:28.20]Oh, don't pass out again.
[118:30.60]Don't do it.
[118:32.46]I can't even.
[118:33.28]I hate when it's dark because everything molds together.
[118:35.34]I can't even see.
[118:35.88]Where's my lantern?
[118:40.46]I'm going to pass out.
[118:41.14]It's over.
[118:42.70]I'm so close.
[118:46.96]I'm right there.
[118:48.84]I'm gonna pass out at my front door again.
[118:52.12]That's what's going to happen.
[118:59.57]Get in the bed!
[119:00.07]Get in the bed!
[119:03.75]No, no, no, don't go to bed.
[119:04.91]I have to put some of the- I have to put the bug meat in the box.
[119:09.65]Oh shit, I'm in my bed, it's okay.
[119:11.32]I'm falling asleep, I didn't do that.
[119:16.39]Okay, we're good.
[119:16.95]I was in my bed.
[119:23.07]I was in bed and I was lying down.
[119:24.43]I know there's a lot of stones scattered around your farm.
[119:28.88]We could build a well.
[119:33.26]Okay.
[119:34.80]I already have water down there.
[119:35.86]A thousand gold.
[119:37.70]Do you want me to pay a thousand gold for something I already have?
[119:40.95]No, thanks.
[119:44.93]You can slay ten slimes, you'll have earned your place in my adventurer's guild.
[119:49.15]I haven't killed that many.
[119:52.45]So I'm going to assume, if it's raining, you don't have to water your plants.
[119:56.78]Right?
[119:57.02]Alright, let's put the bug meat in here.
[120:07.59]Nothing can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum.
[120:11.77]Fuck that.
[120:15.39]I'm in cash right now.
[120:19.15]We're all about the money at the moment, guys.
[120:22.01]Donations to the museum can come much later when I have more than $600 in my savings account.
[120:33.22]Alright.
[120:36.48]Let me get rid of some stuff.
[120:41.99]Or not get rid of it.
[120:43.32]Put it away.
[120:50.20]I don't need the watering can.
[120:53.26]I don't even need the axe.
[120:55.94]I just need these two things.
[120:57.41]Alright.
[121:03.45]Back at it.
[121:05.27]What's with my energy?
[121:06.29]Are you kidding me?
[121:09.61]Do I have to go to bed again?
[121:17.73]I probably should just go back to bed.
[121:23.38]I'm going back to bed.
[121:24.04]I have stuff to sell.
[121:27.24]I'm going back to bed.
[121:29.80]Good night.
[121:32.39]See you tomorrow.
[121:40.97]The fuck?
[121:47.35]One of these was worth 200 gold last time.
[121:55.96]What's the deal?
[121:56.50]Are you kidding me?
[122:05.80]Bugmeat was worth like $150,000.
[122:06.70]Must have been the Geodude.
[122:17.90]What an unstable market.
[122:20.62]These are getting close.
[122:25.21]I'll water them and then leave.
[122:29.95]It was the Geodude?
[122:30.95]Was it really?
[122:31.41]I thought it was the Bugbee.
[122:43.04]So do I age in this game?
[122:44.12]Am I gonna get old?
[122:53.79]Alright, let's do it.
[122:54.99]Put this back.
[122:59.91]How much was the bigger backpack?
[123:02.79]Let's find out.
[123:06.61]I'm curious.
[123:14.35]How much can I sell the ore for?
[123:15.91]Yeah, when is the egg festival?
[123:17.06]Isn't that soon?
[123:20.14]Oh shit, I missed that guy's birthday.
[123:25.02]I told myself not to miss it.
[123:27.16]Oh, shit.
[123:29.06]I missed his birthday.
[123:30.26]Oh, no.
[123:35.94]Well.
[123:38.12]Wait, did we do something for his birthday?
[123:42.15]I kind of want a dog.
[123:53.09]I want an animal of some sort.
[123:59.43]Let's go back to the mine.
[124:01.75]Do what I'm supposed to be doing.
[124:05.25]Sorry I slept your birthday.
[124:06.51]I slept an entire day.
[124:07.99]Yeah, your birthday was, uh... I'm sure it was great, but I was asleep from 7 a.m.
[124:16.37]till 7 a.m.
[124:19.72]Fucking open your doors.
[124:25.32]Just go.
[124:30.15]I want this 25 copper.
[124:33.07]It's very important.
[124:44.46]Somebody explained why he has a Charlie Brown shirt.
[124:48.10]I picked it.
[124:50.40]I went through all the various t-shirts and this is the one that spoke the most to me.
[124:59.52]Is that the museum?
[125:00.22]Might be worth checking that out at some point.
[125:08.04]After this.
[125:14.69]Five.
[125:20.43]Now I have a full inventory available to me.
[125:23.57]I'm just going for the good shit.
[125:30.09]Where is the copper?
[125:33.03]Where are the coppers?
[125:39.99]Not seeing any
[126:00.54]I'm on the big rocks.
[126:10.99]At least I can get the quartz.
[126:18.73]Steve, you just really hit me two times.
[126:20.29]Three times?
[126:22.79]Use the quartz as defense.
[126:32.02]Damn it.
[126:33.88]They really hide the copper down here, huh?
[126:36.90]Oh, this is a good one.
[126:42.65]This is like a rare one.
[126:43.41]Look at that.
[126:43.71]I got a rare.
[126:45.13]There we go.
[126:50.69]Let's go down.
[126:54.29]This is what I'm talking about.
[126:55.29]Look at this.
[126:55.65]Look at this cream of the crop.
[127:01.82]He's going to be locked over here.
[127:08.56]Can you fucking die?
[127:12.60]I might actually get it right here.
[127:13.54]I hope so.
[127:21.41]And one more.
[127:22.81]What's that?
[127:28.53]Yeah, I got it.
[127:29.95]I can finally make a furnace.
[127:31.03]But I don't even need to leave.
[127:34.35]Who says I need to leave?
[127:39.32]Earth crystal?
[127:42.84]Oh, my game lagged.
[127:51.43]I can probably make some bars.
[127:56.11]I'll take that.
[127:59.64]Ooh, what's that?
[128:02.00]That looks pretty rare to me.
[128:02.89]Yeah, that's just an amethyst.
[128:12.45]Should I donate some of these to Gunther?
[128:13.89]I feel like I should.
[128:16.06]Come here.
[128:26.81]I kind of want to just go back.
[128:27.65]Yeah, I'm running out of energy.
[128:29.81]I'm using... Stop swinging so much.
[128:35.79]2 p.m.
[128:36.93]That's a good time to take a nap.
[128:37.89]What do you think?
[128:40.73]Nap time?
[128:48.70]Yeah, I got to go back.
[128:50.46]It's time to go back.
[128:51.18]I'm running out of energy.
[128:52.78]And I have what I need.
[128:53.80]Go up.
[129:09.26]Maybe I will donate one of these to Gunther.
[129:11.48]Definitely not the rare one, but maybe this one can tell me more about it.
[129:15.84]Where's the museum?
[129:23.93]Museum, museum.
[129:26.35]Community center.
[129:29.35]Mayor's Manor.
[129:30.37]The blacksmith.
[129:31.05]Sit down.
[129:36.01]Wait, is the museum up here?
[129:41.37]I should have paid attention to what that guy said.
[129:42.95]There's a saloon.
[129:45.77]Definitely go in there.
[129:46.49]There's the Adventurer's Guild.
[129:50.55]Where is the museum?
[129:51.89]Is that building up there?
[129:58.31]Let's find out.
[129:59.61]I've never been up this way.
[130:00.73]I guess I'll talk to this guy.
[130:04.68]I've not come to ridicule you.
[130:05.84]Why would I do that?
[130:06.46]I'm going to go in your tent.
[130:12.37]Now this is pretty damn claustrophobic.
[130:14.19]I'm out of here.
[130:20.32]I guess I can't even go this way.
[130:23.32]Back down to reality.
[130:30.44]Let's go down there and donate some stuff.
[130:34.87]I'll give you a donation.
[130:36.65]Why not?
[130:37.85]Tell me more about it.
[130:47.91]I hope I get a car soon.
[130:51.30]Please tell me I get some type of vehicle.
[130:56.24]I'm leaning back in my chair right now.
[130:59.92]I'm leaning so far back.
[131:01.42]I hope you guys can still hear me.
[131:08.39]I'm just relaxing.
[131:10.09]My feet are up.
[131:16.13]Down here.
[131:19.86]This looks different.
[131:24.50]You tell me you're not open.
[131:25.53]Don't even tell me he's not open.
[131:30.37]What is Captain Crunch doing here?
[131:36.35]There he is.
[131:42.18]I guess you make this guy's museum.
[131:49.79]You found something?
[131:50.55]Let me see it.
[131:51.13]I hope he... He's just not taking shit, is he?
[131:58.56]It's very old.
[131:59.36]I'd love to study this in greater detail, but it's yours.
[132:01.56]I've got a favor to ask you.
[132:05.82]Would you consider donating any new artifacts or minerals that you find?
[132:08.60]Sure.
[132:09.88]Okay.
[132:21.11]I can do that.
[132:22.63]I'll bring him to the front desk.
[132:28.97]Hello.
[132:31.29]Donate to the museum.
[132:33.21]I'm giving him the regular quality one.
[132:35.05]Do I actually have to put it down somewhere?
[132:37.78]No, I can put it right there.
[132:38.82]Okay.
[132:47.56]Archaeology.
[132:48.18]Gunther asked if you'd consider donating and you did.
[132:53.80]I thought he was going to tell me more about it.
[132:55.52]I thought the whole point of that was he was like, oh, by the way, you can use that to make a special snake sword.
[133:03.86]Can I take it back?
[133:08.07]I, like, want this back.
[133:12.27]Should I donate this to him?
[133:16.09]No, you got what you wanted, Gunther.
[133:17.39]I have a thousand dollars.
[133:18.33]I'm out of here.
[133:34.30]If I find things, I can give it to them.
[133:38.20]That's okay.
[133:38.90]That's fine with me.
[133:40.92]This is closed.
[133:44.71]What are these things?
[133:45.27]Kind of bobbing around.
[133:48.19]That's not how donations work.
[133:55.13]Well, I thought he was going to tell me more about the jewel.
[134:00.70]I guess he kind of did.
[134:01.50]Oh, yeah.
[134:07.38]I can go to the wizard.
[134:10.30]What's on this board?
[134:12.83]Vincent's birthday is coming up.
[134:14.57]Make sure to give him a new rock for his...
[134:19.44]Initiation.
[134:20.34]Kill the slimes.
[134:21.66]Reach level 40.
[134:22.46]Go meet the wizard.
[134:24.14]Reach farming level 1 and craft a scarecrow.
[134:28.04]Maybe I'll do that.
[134:32.89]I can get animals.
[134:36.47]I do need to make a furnace.
[134:37.41]That's important.
[134:38.27]I have the materials to do that now.
[134:42.05]Actually, I'm gonna go do that right now.
[134:43.15]And then we'll go to the wizard.
[134:49.80]Yeah, Ronnie, that's what I was thinking.
[134:50.88]I was going to donate to him, and he was going to say, Oh, thank you for your donation.
[134:54.58]By the way, you must know, this crystal is so old, and it has great capabilities.
[135:00.98]I'm not going on the bus.
[135:04.68]You can use that to socket a shield.
[135:10.24]Okay, furnace.
[135:13.84]Furnace.
[135:14.20]Should I put this in the house?
[135:18.18]Is it going to burn my house down?
[135:21.77]I hope not.
[135:24.41]Let's put it right here.
[135:33.21]Move some of this other shit around.
[135:34.40]I need to pick a house.
[135:38.92]How do I get a bigger house?
[135:41.38]Whatever.
[135:41.74]Who cares?
[135:46.80]Put the dog ball next to me.
[135:47.94]I want to make things.
[135:48.86]Craft.
[135:53.08]Okay.
[135:54.50]Campfire.
[135:57.50]Torch.
[135:59.48]Furnace.
[136:00.14]Cherry bomb.
[136:04.70]Alrighty.
[136:07.82]Skills.
[136:11.15]So do I just drag and drop these in here?
[136:14.01]Yeah.
[136:15.71]That makes a loud explosion noise.
[136:20.87]How long does it take?
[136:25.90]Chop chop, let's go.
[136:26.68]Oh!
[136:32.49]I didn't do that.
[136:35.57]Did I lose those?
[136:36.37]No, don't even tell me I lost them.
[136:41.33]What the fuck?
[136:51.31]No!
[136:53.40]I'm going to bed.
[137:00.80]Five copper ore and one piece of coal in the furnace to produce a copper bar.
[137:03.76]I just did that.
[137:07.02]It's gone.
[137:09.50]Fucking... Here you go, Grandpa.
[137:16.25]Take all this.
[137:16.91]I don't even care.
[137:17.57]I'm just fucking mad now.
[137:21.03]Take this, too.
[137:21.71]Take the slime.
[137:23.73]Take the stone.
[137:27.47]I don't even care.
[137:28.21]I'm going to bed.
[137:30.21]Good night.
[137:31.79]Good freaking night.
[137:44.98]That wasn't worth it.
[137:45.84]That was worth it, but this wasn't.
[137:53.82]Smelting level expert.
[137:56.33]Oh, I'm so mad.
[137:58.42]I'm so mad.
[137:59.38]It should have popped out of the back.
[138:00.44]Like, it should have shitted out of the back like an old dinosaur toy that you squeeze on.
[138:05.62]Fuck this painting.
[138:09.27]Sell this thing.
[138:10.51]Oh, great.
[138:12.91]Your dog's gonna shit all over my lawn now?
[138:17.17]You see this dog here?
[138:24.86]I found it sitting outside the entrance to your farm.
[138:26.77]I think it's a stray.
[138:27.75]Poor thing.
[138:28.21]Aww.
[138:29.91]Maybe he'll be my best friend.
[138:32.27]Seems to like this place.
[138:33.73]Hey, um, do you think that this farm could use a good dog?
[138:38.21]Of course!
[138:38.75]Uh, no.
[138:48.88]It's gotta be good.
[138:57.12]There you go.
[138:57.46]Dogbendio.
[139:01.68]Dogbendio.
[139:02.40]Except it's a U. Couldn't have named it Otto.
[139:16.01]That name sucks.
[139:20.07]Where is he?
[139:23.96]Get away from the furnace.
[139:24.84]Get away from the furnace.
[139:26.50]That's not a good place for you to be, boy.
[139:27.98]You don't want to be standing next to the furnace.
[139:30.36]Here.
[139:32.10]I'll put some treats in here.
[139:33.04]Do I have to buy dog food?
[139:41.33]How do I... Can I interact with him?
[139:42.31]Where is he going?
[139:46.45]Hey, boy.
[139:46.71]You want to watch some TV?
[139:47.79]You want to watch some TV?
[139:49.35]Okay.
[139:50.85]Oh!
[139:56.59]Where is he?
[140:00.69]Get out of there!
[140:04.24]Get out!
[140:04.78]Okay, now you can move.
[140:12.24]I was about to be real sad.
[140:20.63]It's dead.
[140:21.11]It's not dead, he's alive.
[140:22.11]He was just hiding.
[140:29.37]Why does he want to be inside the TV?
[140:32.01]He really is gone.
[140:35.99]Wait a second.
[140:38.71]Where did he go?
[140:39.41]Did I break him?
[140:40.17]No.
[140:45.27]Oh, he's up here now.
[140:48.76]Okay.
[140:51.20]Don't scare me like that.
[141:00.29]Oh, this season's crop sure did come in well.
[141:06.09]Damn, that took forever to make that potato.
[141:09.51]That was an eternity.
[141:13.41]Can I feed him one?
[141:15.67]Hey, I got a turnip for you.
[141:16.75]Come here.
[141:21.30]No.
[141:21.92]I want to feed the dog a parsnip.
[141:26.02]No.
[141:28.56]Can I give him a potato?
[141:31.11]I guess not.
[141:34.29]Well, we're just going to sell these.
[141:39.21]Because who cares?
[141:39.85]We'll see what the potato's worth, because that took fucking forever.
[141:49.92]Give me the watering can.
[141:53.53]Give me the watering can and one of my plants for a second here.
[142:05.62]Okay.
[142:06.64]This time, do not fuck it up.
[142:15.61]It's the kid's birthday today?
[142:17.99]What am I supposed to do?
[142:19.69]What does he want?
[142:21.05]For his birthday?
[142:22.17]Can we bring my dog into town and let him pet the dog?
[142:27.22]Copper bar.
[142:37.14]What the hell is it?
[142:41.26]Did I like accidentally like click, click, click, click and accidentally got away from it?
[142:45.53]Whatever.
[142:45.93]I have a bar now.
[142:50.91]Campfire.
[142:55.13]I guess I could just make it wood fence.
[142:58.19]Gate.
[142:59.18]Wooden path.
[143:00.22]Gravel path.
[143:03.34]Let's get some of this.
[143:09.29]Let's spruce the place up a little bit.
[143:13.69]I'm going to make a gravel path here.
[143:17.61]Ready?
[143:32.20]That looks like shit.
[143:33.26]Okay, well, whatever.
[143:34.02]This is where the path is going to
[143:39.38]Pick that up.
[143:39.88]Pick it up.
[143:45.54]I don't like that over there.
[143:50.89]You know what?
[143:51.59]Here.
[143:51.69]Grandpa, take these.
[143:53.49]Maybe you can get some use out of those.
[143:56.31]Take a bush, too.
[143:57.21]Okay, water.
[144:11.84]Fill up the can.
[144:14.38]Alright.
[144:19.74]What is he doing back there?
[144:28.36]Where's the dog?
[144:30.88]What's next?
[144:33.12]Oh, I know what's next.
[144:34.40]I'm buying a backpack.
[144:38.04]Let's get some good crops.
[144:39.00]Let's get some expensive crops.
[144:43.17]Where's the little kid?
[144:44.96]It's his birthday today.
[144:45.70]Where is he?
[144:48.74]You want me to give him a copper bar?
[144:50.10]Here you go, sonny.
[144:52.06]It's a pure copper bar.
[144:55.22]No one ever gave you a present like this before.
[144:56.94]I don't know where he lives.
[145:08.98]I truly don't know where he is.
[145:16.20]I just read in the chat.
[145:18.18]No water for the dog.
[145:19.72]Whoops.
[145:21.22]Hold on.
[145:21.54]Should I go do that?
[145:22.24]He'll be okay.
[145:24.66]I'll go get him water.
[145:25.42]Hold on.
[145:25.88]I know it's his birthday.
[145:31.60]Looking for a herring.
[145:33.78]I can get that.
[145:35.52]How many days?
[145:38.62]Two days for a herring?
[145:40.02]Easy.
[145:44.74]You closed on Wednesday?
[145:47.73]What an odd fucking time to be closed.
[145:52.23]Middle of the week.
[145:52.89]What the hell is this place?
[146:04.46]Can I take some of their equipment?
[146:09.36]You're not good enough- the guy lives in a hospital?
[146:18.39]I can wash my hands in this thing.
[146:21.17]It's full of used syringes, dirty swabs, and little nozzles.
[146:26.35]Okay.
[146:27.25]Whatever you say.
[146:27.87]It's a sample jar.
[146:32.00]Somebody peed in that jar?
[146:36.68]I don't want to read any of that.
[146:42.76]The place is closed.
[146:44.32]I need to find this little kid.
[146:47.39]I need to give that kid a youth syringe.
[146:52.03]Where is he?
[146:53.97]What is this hangout spot?
[146:55.77]I'm giving him a campfire.
[146:57.79]That's probably... Wait, that's not a good idea.
[146:59.15]Hey, little kid, do you want a campfire to play with?
[147:04.25]Or a sword?
[147:05.67]There he is, there he is.
[147:08.47]How do I approach this situation?
[147:12.81]I want to look for bugs, but mom gets mad when I'm all dirty.
[147:15.77]It's a tough choice.
[147:23.15]Uh, he wants a bug?
[147:27.87]How do I... Oh, fuck!
[147:31.27]I gave him a piece of copper.
[147:34.39]Yeah, that was your birthday present.
[147:39.38]Well, enjoy that precious stone.
[147:54.21]Happy birthday kid here's a swirly Why would he be mad about that honestly If somebody walked up to a copper is expensive If a dude came up to me on my birthday that I'd never talked to and handed me a chunk of copper worth like a hundred bucks He's serious a hundred dollars to a seven-year-old is like 20 grand.
[148:19.32]Oh
[148:23.61]Alright, where do I buy a backpack?
[148:26.21]Will this guy talk to me yet?
[148:31.08]Will somebody talk to me?
[148:36.66]I don't think I'm making any friends, guys.
[148:44.53]It's a nugget, not a... That's a chunk.
[148:46.81]That is a big chunk.
[148:52.38]Oh, screw that.
[148:53.04]Wait, blacksmith.
[148:53.66]I want to see what this guy has to tell me.
[149:01.91]9am to 4pm.
[149:05.21]You guys and your weird hours.
[149:07.87]What business opens at 9 and closes at 4 and it's not like a Sunday?
[149:10.85]I just want a backpack.
[149:18.94]Where do I buy a backpack?
[149:20.02]And is the store open?
[149:26.50]Somebody just went in here.
[149:28.00]Somebody just went in there.
[149:29.16]I'm going to bed.
[149:34.35]See you guys tomorrow morning.
[149:39.21]No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[149:39.97]I need to fish.
[149:42.59]I gotta go get a herring.
[149:43.35]12 p.m.
[149:43.43]to 12 a.m.
[149:55.68]Somebody just said to go to the saloon.
[149:56.94]That is exactly what I'm doing.
[149:58.20]Is that it right there?
[150:02.80]Which building is this?
[150:03.58]Mayor's Manor Saloon.
[150:04.70]No, it's up there.
[150:12.02]Let's do it.
[150:12.44]Let's get drunk.
[150:15.39]Oh, yeah.
[150:16.01]Okay, buy a couple of rounds for me and my friends.
[150:24.45]I spilled a whole bucket of milk on the floor today.
[150:26.15]It was horrible and such a waste of my poor Belinda's hard work.
[150:31.29]That's too bad.
[150:33.87]I'm too young to be mopping around a place like this.
[150:36.39]I'll say that.
[150:39.55]Can I get you anything?
[150:40.25]Yeah.
[150:47.48]How do I buy something?
[150:50.40]Magic rings, huh?
[150:54.71]When's the bad guy gonna come in?
[150:57.63]Beer.
[150:57.95]400 gold!
[151:04.83]400 gold for a glass of beer.
[151:12.00]Beer is more... One beer is more expensive.
[151:15.82]Almost two times more expensive than a plate of spaghetti with sauce.
[151:22.07]You are running a real shit show here, dude.
[151:27.36]A full pizza is 600.
[151:31.86]Hash browns?
[151:33.74]Omelet recipe?
[151:34.81]Oh, eggs.
[151:39.27]Maki maki roll?
[151:42.59]Oh, look at pancakes.
[151:45.07]I'm buying some pancakes.
[151:46.05]You have to, right?
[151:52.12]Coffee.
[151:52.84]Yeah.
[151:53.20]No.
[151:53.76]No.
[151:56.34]I need to get a backpack.
[152:02.97]I think a backpack was about a thousand?
[152:06.97]Something like that?
[152:12.15]Look at that empty gaze.
[152:14.78]You're not good enough friends with this guy to go break into his bedroom.
[152:18.12]Please.
[152:29.48]I thought that was gonna be way more upbeat than it is.
[152:31.22]Alright, I'm not gonna lie.
[152:45.39]These are absolutely not songs that would be played in a bar.
[152:50.94]Imagine if you walked into a bar, and this is the song that was playing over the loudspeaker.
[152:59.67]It would be a fight.
[153:00.57]Somebody would get in a fight.
[153:03.27]The whole bar would start rioting.
[153:09.99]At least I have pancakes.
[153:14.44]Some guy across the bar would be like, Where the fuck is Led Zeppelin?
[153:18.46]What is this shit?
[153:20.24]And then somebody else would be like, It's Artsy.
[153:21.82]Come on.
[153:22.12]Calm down, buddy.
[153:22.94]And then all of a sudden, just out of nowhere, he's gonna snap.
[153:25.41]He's gonna start attacking somebody.
[153:32.94]Alright, I need to get a herring.
[153:34.63]I'm going to wake up tomorrow morning real super early and go get a herring.
[153:45.43]Let's go down.
[153:48.13]Well, I gave the kid a birthday present that he didn't like.
[153:50.60]That was the entire day today.
[153:55.81]I'm glad I spent my entire day finding that kid and him being disappointed at getting a ton of free money.
[154:07.68]Oh shit, my dog.
[154:09.66]Is he okay?
[154:10.06]Let's see if he's alright.
[154:12.46]I'm gonna feed my dog pancakes.
[154:20.55]Here boy, have some nice hearty meal today.
[154:23.25]Have some pancakes.
[154:29.23]Oh, yeah, yeah, where is he?
[154:30.17]Let's see, I'll fill up his bowl.
[154:34.33]See, I did it.
[154:34.93]There we go.
[154:37.81]Okay, dog.
[154:42.40]Oh, look, there he is.
[154:43.28]Shh, I don't want to wake him up.
[154:50.56]Oh.
[155:17.59]level up level up level up I can make a scarecrow now and I can make fertilizer finally a potato is worth 430 gold damn damn that's a lot of money how much starting to rake in cash you know what I'm saying
[155:47.07]Now let's cook those pancakes.
[155:50.35]No, I want to cook them.
[155:51.77]I want to extra cook them.
[155:57.73]That actually scared me.
[155:58.97]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[156:03.22]Tiger Lotus, thanks for something.
[156:05.92]I haven't heard that in a while.
[156:07.04]That really actually startled me.
[156:11.44]But welcome.
[156:13.74]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[156:15.89]Can I see some moons in the chat, please?
[156:28.97]Oh, that's the total.
[156:30.39]The potato is the only thing I put in there, isn't it?
[156:34.73]Did I put all those things in there?
[156:36.76]I guess I did.
[156:38.62]I lost my favorite axe.
[156:39.58]If you find it, please return it.
[156:40.50]I'm having a tough time without it.
[156:41.88]There's 250 gold.
[156:45.21]How the fuck am I supposed to know where this is?
[156:47.55]I guess I'll take it, but where... Robin's lost axe.
[156:51.93]Last time she remembers using it, she was cutting wood south of Marine's Ranch.
[156:55.69]Marnie's Ranch.
[157:02.97]There's Marnie's Ranch.
[157:04.73]Let's go find it.
[157:07.07]Oh, fuck, no, I have to get... Okay, we're gonna go to Marnie's Ranch, wrap around, get a herring.
[157:15.08]There's too much to do in this game.
[157:17.02]It's too overwhelming.
[157:20.12]I do have my pancakes when I get in a dire need.
[157:22.65]Gonna water that shit.
[157:37.69]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[157:41.03]Catman1900, thank you for subscribing.
[157:44.93]Welcome to the wonderful group of athletic trapeze artists.
[157:58.34]Wait, my dog.
[157:58.98]Here.
[158:01.78]See, I remember.
[158:05.21]Orson Welles was the original.
[158:06.52]Yeah, he pretty much was.
[158:07.84]Okay.
[158:10.16]Let's go south of Maureen's farm.
[158:14.82]Let's go find the axe.
[158:16.86]Swing around.
[158:19.42]Get the herring.
[158:21.58]Swing for the fences.
[158:22.28]Okay, so it's down there.
[158:31.33]What if the axe is better than what I'm using?
[158:32.59]Can I keep it?
[158:35.71]Here's the ranch.
[158:40.05]This is down here somewhere.
[158:41.11]Oh boy, that's potential for a lot of searching.
[158:55.45]Trevor, you got to clean up the shit around you.
[158:56.89]I know there's just a lot to do.
[159:01.52]There's a lot.
[159:02.06]I found it.
[159:05.99]You found the lost axe.
[159:07.03]Better return it to Robin.
[159:08.03]Alright.
[159:15.07]Where does Robin live?
[159:17.76]Jodie, Kent, Emily, Hayley.
[159:22.16]George, Evelyn, and Alex.
[159:26.36]Clinic.
[159:30.46]Marnie's Ranch.
[159:31.76]Leia's Cottage.
[159:36.14]Where does this fucking person live?
[159:37.22]Oh, and I gotta pee.
[159:48.90]Down here?
[159:52.88]Oh, I got it.
[159:53.36]Is that toilet paper?
[160:01.70]There's a bunch of trash down here.
[160:09.26]Alright, if I pause the game to go pee, will it, will time go forward?
[160:13.49]No, it's paused, okay.
[160:15.69]Alright, I'll be right back.
[160:17.03]I need to pee.
[160:18.97]I have to pee, pee, pee.
[160:21.53]So, hold on to your seats.
[160:24.00]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[160:27.78]And, and I'm gonna get a snack.
[160:32.22]Might be crackers.
[160:34.33]Might be cheese.
[160:36.12]Maybe I might even get a couple of steak tips or something.
[162:52.79]I'm back.
[163:00.11]And you know what I got?
[163:03.49]You know what I got?
[163:06.17]The best snack ever.
[163:10.21]The best one is not pancakes.
[163:14.12]I learned how to mute your mic.
[163:15.92]For what?
[163:18.08]What am I muting for?
[163:31.86]You know what?
[163:32.14]I think that's just going to be a running gag.
[163:35.11]I'm just not going to mute my... Even if you can hear the toilet flushing, that's fucking hilarious to me.
[163:40.63]You know why that's funny?
[163:42.61]Because for somebody that's never watched this stream before ever, right?
[163:48.55]If they come in just right now, and there's nobody here, there's nobody here streaming, and in two minutes they hear a toilet flush...
[163:57.92]That is absolutely hilarious to me.
[164:00.34]Because they're probably going to leave.
[164:01.42]They're going to be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[164:05.34]I just heard like a toilet flush.
[164:06.90]Is this person playing games?
[164:10.56]And then they leave.
[164:22.07]Something about that is so... I don't know.
[164:24.45]I'm never muting my mic ever.
[164:29.71]What was I doing?
[164:30.25]Oh yeah, I had to go get a fish.
[164:37.30]I should make a sub sound, a toilet flush.
[164:43.14]Can I cast my line into this dirty sewer?
[164:46.10]Oh, no I can't.
[165:13.37]I'm trying to eat as quiet as I can.
[165:29.00]Here we go!
[165:32.92]Oh, it's a fucking crazy one!
[165:41.84]That was hard.
[165:42.78]That actually was really hard.
[165:48.16]A herring, come on.
[166:00.75]Oh damn, a sunfish.
[166:02.03]That's not a herring.
[166:10.84]Alright, so we're going to do a snack Q&A.
[166:15.20]What is this snack I'm eating right now?
[166:18.02]That's so vague.
[166:19.04]How would anyone ever get that?
[166:20.27]What a terrible game show that would be.
[166:24.61]In fact, I was going to tell you because that was a stupid idea.
[166:28.13]It is the Keebler Club Crackers with the cheese in the middle.
[166:33.65]You know the little sandwich crackers?
[166:37.30]It's those and they're amazing.
[166:42.85]Ooh, that thing's 13 inches.
[166:45.43]Damn, that's big.
[166:46.41]Yeah, it's the club and cheddar sandwich crackers.
[166:57.34]Not the peanut butter ones.
[166:59.40]Forget about it.
[167:00.82]Cheese on cheese.
[167:02.78]Really?
[167:08.48]13 inch chub.
[167:10.90]How did I miss that?
[167:12.98]I actually missed that.
[167:13.96]Out of all the things to miss, I missed that one.
[167:19.92]No, I'm going to a different spot.
[167:20.98]I need a herring.
[167:31.97]Oh, the French champagne.
[167:34.77]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[167:42.50]Oh my god, my game just was crashing there.
[167:44.24]That was crazy.
[167:50.55]Herring.
[167:52.49]No.
[167:53.49]You know, I got a herring down here.
[167:56.01]Maybe I should go back down there.
[167:56.97]I'll give it one more go.
[168:11.82]Oh, this is a weakling.
[168:14.58]Can you get better at fishing, Paul?
[168:15.96]Eventually, I'm assuming you probably can.
[168:18.88]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[168:24.44]Your wishes just subscribed.
[168:25.92]Thanks, Lopin.
[168:26.66]Your three wishes.
[168:30.93]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[168:37.39]Darth Buttcrust, welcome back.
[168:42.00]With your three... three months.
[168:46.62]Much appreciated, both of you.
[168:47.76]Thank you.
[168:50.60]Thank you.
[168:51.01]Oh boy, here comes another one.
[168:55.77]Subbed for flush.
[168:58.81]Well, you know, sometimes you subscribe because somebody flushes their toilet on stream.
[169:04.77]This is the toilet stream, so thank you.
[169:09.21]I need a herring.
[169:09.91]No more of this garbage.
[169:15.00]I need a herring, herring, herring.
[169:21.26]We're gonna change our fishing spot, although I'm getting some pretty good fish here.
[169:27.91]I need a backpack too, there's so many things to do.
[169:33.17]Spice Soup.
[169:36.31]Welcome to the toilet, streamers.
[169:39.17]Thank you very much, enjoy your stay.
[169:42.55]Enjoy me struggling with this really easy fish.
[169:47.43]There's a 16-inch chub.
[169:50.23]Now that's impressive.
[169:53.52]That's impressive.
[169:58.92]I caught a herring down here.
[169:59.96]So I'm going to go down there.
[170:02.26]It's Thursday.
[170:05.39]Can I walk up here?
[170:13.37]Although I can eat these, I can sell them.
[170:17.09]I can't believe one person made this.
[170:23.40]Is this a lake?
[170:23.96]Doesn't this connect to here?
[170:24.84]I mean, this is where I was fishing.
[170:27.44]This is not a... I mean, this is technically part of the bigger picture, right?
[170:33.90]Whatever.
[170:35.66]Give the axe back.
[170:36.42]Isn't she down here?
[170:36.98]Or is she up here?
[170:41.98]How long do I have to do that?
[170:45.28]I don't think I... Yeah, I have a time period on this one.
[170:47.52]I don't think the Lost Axe has a time limit on it.
[170:55.34]Do it.
[170:58.30]Almost there.
[170:59.96]What the hell is this?
[171:03.80]This really is Animal Crossing.
[171:04.84]This is... Actually, this is like an Animal Crossing with more things to do.
[171:10.36]As odd as that sounds.
[171:11.53]Alright, where is this person?
[171:15.12]Archaeology office?
[171:15.98]No.
[171:17.44]I want to go down to the dock.
[171:19.66]What's the fastest way to get to the dock from here?
[171:21.44]No, I missed it.
[171:27.96]It's down here.
[171:30.06]Right?
[171:31.06]I think so?
[171:31.45]I don't know.
[171:32.07]It's weird to look at that map.
[171:34.55]Yeah, it's this way.
[171:38.49]Whoa.
[171:40.21]Whoa, clamps.
[171:42.17]Is there a pearl in here?
[171:48.37]I don't know.
[171:50.27]Um... Oh shit, there's clams everywhere.
[171:53.98]Yeah, eat the horseradish.
[171:58.24]Pick up more clams.
[172:01.58]Sell these things.
[172:04.74]Muscle?
[172:06.61]Why do I have this trash?
[172:08.15]Am I serious?
[172:13.96]Stop.
[172:15.34]I hated this when it happened in that Minecraft video game, and I don't like it now.
[172:18.95]Is there a way I can make that stop happening?
[172:20.81]Okay, let's try over here.
[172:32.96]Will I be streaming Overwatch tonight?
[172:36.43]I don't know.
[172:37.17]I'm having fun doing this.
[172:39.34]Maybe later.
[172:40.16]Maybe tomorrow or something.
[172:41.34]I don't know.
[172:42.46]I'm relaxing, hanging out, playing this at the moment.
[172:45.90]I don't know.
[172:47.64]We'll see.
[172:47.96]What does the thing at the top mean?
[172:54.10]Is that like a treasure chest if I touch it or something?
[172:59.04]I'm confused.
[172:59.70]For right now, we're doing this.
[173:07.83]I can also play Lay's of Fear, too.
[173:10.72]That's another one.
[173:12.60]Whoa, I went way too high.
[173:23.52]Those worms in the ground.
[173:26.35]There's some Nightcrawlers over there.
[173:27.61]I should get them.
[173:32.47]Sardine.
[173:32.99]I'm running out of space.
[173:35.91]Should I eat the pancakes?
[173:40.75]No.
[173:45.55]I'm running out of rum.
[173:50.37]Eat the algae.
[173:53.49]It'll make you feel better.
[173:56.29]It'll give you indigestion.
[173:59.85]I'm gonna go off the actual duck.
[174:06.34]Zemarian or Riot?
[174:07.64]Are you kidding me?
[174:09.42]Zemarian?
[174:16.19]I think we had enough of that game.
[174:20.71]Yeah, why do pancakes make you better at foraging?
[174:22.37]That doesn't make any sense.
[174:23.03]Maybe because they're so delicious, it just gives you extra power?
[174:33.98]What the hell is this doing?
[174:38.60]Okay, well that was really easy.
[174:39.78]22 inch halibut.
[174:44.32]I have a lot of fish.
[174:50.68]What do I do here?
[174:51.66]Can I eat the muscle?
[174:54.72]No.
[174:55.42]Let's sell this.
[174:55.98]Can I sell it to him here?
[174:58.74]No, I don't want to gift it to him.
[175:00.20]I want him to buy it.
[175:00.84]I just got to pay for it.
[175:07.41]I really want you to pay for this, but I need to get rid of it in my inventory.
[175:10.75]Yeah, you're welcome.
[175:19.78]Where is that herring?
[175:20.62]I'm running out of time here.
[175:38.13]Let this be the herring I need so I can get my money and move on with my life.
[175:44.27]Herring?
[175:45.57]Yeah!
[175:47.83]Herring, herring, herring, herring.
[175:49.97]Who wanted it?
[175:50.61]Delivery.
[175:52.67]Pam.
[175:54.09]Bring Pam a herring.
[175:57.82]Shit, it's late at night.
[175:59.40]Doesn't Pam live in one of these houses?
[176:02.42]Jody, Kent, and Sam.
[176:05.98]Home of George, Evelyn, and Alex.
[176:12.21]That's my house.
[176:14.33]I still haven't visited the wizard.
[176:18.05]Shit.
[176:23.18]Does she just hang out in the saloon?
[176:26.62]What do these buttons do?
[176:28.60]With the weird statues on them.
[176:33.85]Alright, Pam, I got your fish for you.
[176:37.91]Where's the bar?
[176:38.61]Right here.
[176:42.51]Ah, don't crash.

[176:47.84]Pam?
[176:49.24]I have something for you.

[176:55.12]Hey, I have something for you.
[176:58.02]It's a herring.
[177:01.90]This is a big one, too.
[177:03.80]Herring.
[177:05.96]No!
[177:07.19]Give her the herring.
[177:09.53]If I just ate the herring in front of her, that would suck so bad.
[177:16.09]It does look perfect.
[177:24.71]90 gold.
[177:27.17]Okay, Pam.
[177:30.72]Zero out of 10.
[177:34.10]Zero out of 10, and I just brought you a big succulent fish.
[177:37.50]Pam, what the heck is up with that?
[177:42.52]Zero out of 10.

[178:43.02]You know, I think I'm just gonna drop these fish in the, uh...
[178:48.12]Will Grandpa take these and will I get good common value for them or should I sell them to the fishermen?
[178:56.65]I'm afraid to do this because they're all rare.
[179:00.33]Somebody in chat please guide me on this one because I'm about to put them all in.
[179:08.58]While I eat one of my Keebler crackers.
[179:11.74]Discuss.
[179:25.88]I'm getting a mixed response here.
[179:46.95]Kill grandpa?
[179:49.75]It's the same wherever you go.
[179:53.73]Fish out people too.

[185:27.92]Jazz seeds, oil, vinegar... Who had it?
[185:31.48]Was it not this guy?
[185:34.93]Who the fuck sells the backpack?
[185:40.97]Is it not the general store?
[185:42.05]I thought it was the store.
[185:43.01]Like, this general store.
[185:50.93]Malt flooring, cherry sapling...
[185:57.33]What the fuck is it?
[185:59.37]I don't want wallpaper.
[186:04.30]Oh, that's... That... Come on, why did you... Bullshit.

[186:18.18]Okay, so I have an inventory of 24 now, right?
[186:21.27]Yes, I do.
[186:23.41]Look at that.
[186:24.23]Perfect.
[186:27.60]You guys can say whatever you want, but if you're selling a backpack and I talk to you and you don't list the backpack... Sneaking, sneaking, sneaking, sneaking.
[186:39.23]Sneaking, sneaking.
[186:40.83]I got him.
[186:42.97]The game's crashing.
[186:46.53]What can I do in here now?
[186:49.09]This guy's got a church in his house?
[186:51.31]What's that?
[186:51.61]Take it.
[186:53.47]Get it.
[186:59.23]I don't know what they're doing here.
[187:05.42]What can I do?
[187:06.08]What can I do in here?
[187:06.78]It's a fine looking day.
[187:08.92]It sure is.
[187:09.42]Those donuts?
[187:18.23]No, no, no, no.
[187:19.43]Alright, get me out of here.
[187:20.67]What's that?
[187:23.61]To Mr. Pure, it pains me to do the bare of bad news, but I feel obligated to inform you
[187:28.66]Oh, something happened.
[187:30.66]Something with Jojo Mart is in some degree responsible for your predicament.
[187:34.94]There's a lot going on, whatever.
[187:36.24]I'm not gonna read somebody else's mail.
[187:41.28]Let's go.
[187:45.02]Was I even supposed- I was allowed to go in there the whole time, wasn't I?
[187:47.45]I think so.
[187:52.77]What do you want?
[187:55.81]Definitely gonna... Oh, you better believe I'm gonna go into the egg hunt tomorrow and I'm gonna destroy everyone.
[188:02.77]Actually, you know what?
[188:03.33]I could buy... Let's get some crops.
[188:08.80]Expensive ones, too.
[188:12.28]Uh... Bean starter?
[188:15.92]Ten days in the spring.
[188:19.19]Alright, we're doing it.
[188:20.15]Grows on a trellis.
[188:22.97]What does that mean?
[188:25.43]Let's just buy a shitload of them.
[188:28.71]About nine of them.
[188:29.33]What does that mean, a trellis?
[188:32.47]What does that word mean?
[188:33.27]What does that word mean?
[188:34.39]I'm not missing the egg fest.
[188:38.95]It's only one o'clock.
[188:51.39]I can marry all these people?
[188:56.90]Magic beans.
[188:58.74]Thankfully, I picked up the magic bean kit.
[189:02.18]Oh shit, I didn't water these.
[189:03.12]Are these dead?
[189:07.71]Why do they look dead?
[189:14.37]Where do I plant these?
[189:19.59]On a trellis?
[189:26.09]Trellis is a wooden structure that vines and stalks grow on.
[189:30.27]So can I not plant them?
[189:31.45]I don't get it.
[189:32.69]Looks like I can.
[189:33.65]Holy shit.
[189:37.23]Come here, dog.
[189:37.97]I got you.
[189:39.01]I got you.
[189:42.76]He's just freaked out.
[189:48.04]I got him.
[189:48.50]He's fine.
[189:48.98]I watered him.
[189:51.44]So what happens if I plant one here?
[189:52.56]Will it actually do anything?
[189:56.49]Oh, okay, it doesn't... Okay, whatever.
[189:57.97]So I'm going to have to increase this.
[190:09.47]I thought I had to build a certain device or something.
[190:14.63]But I do need to get my hoe.
[190:18.64]There it is.
[190:28.28]Okay.
[190:31.24]I can make fertilizer now.
[190:32.94]Did I do that?
[190:33.42]Let's do some watering.
[190:42.07]Calm down, dog.
[190:45.51]Is he stuck up there?
[190:54.58]and there is about 700 gold spent let's hope they get it let's hope we get some good yields okay uh I want to be well rested for the egg festival load up on water and I kind of want to see what it takes to wild seeds
[191:20.68]Basic fertilizer to improve soil quality a little, increasing your chance to grow quality crops.
[191:25.42]Mix into tilled soil.
[191:27.84]Two sap.
[191:29.24]Well, let's go knock some trees down.
[191:33.81]Look at the axe.
[191:34.41]I'm going to cut trees down for about four hours game time.
[191:51.28]Oink.
[191:59.26]Gimme gimme gimme.
[192:02.49]It's an acorn there.
[192:06.43]Do I plant the acorns?
[192:07.57]I'm gonna assume that's what I do, right?
[192:15.99]Plant the dog?
[192:19.07]That wouldn't be very nice.
[192:28.94]Got a lot of wood.
[192:32.28]I'm sure I can do something else with this besides the fertilizer.
[192:44.57]Let's go make some fertilizer.
[192:46.61]One more tree.
[192:57.14]I'll call it a day.
[193:02.74]Water the pond?
[193:03.58]I just took water out of it.
[193:09.58]Oh, there's a big log in the way.
[193:11.44]There's a big log clogging up my drain.
[193:19.08]So I'm assuming I have to do that before I plant things, right?
[193:22.89]I would have to take a guess and say that.
[193:33.06]Let's see.
[193:36.14]Do I have to... Uh... I'm gonna... I'm going to just assume that that's what I have to do, because I don't want to waste this.
[193:48.16]But it doesn't look like I can plant it.
[193:51.28]No, okay, yeah, I can.
[193:54.86]So what happens if I do it now?
[193:57.64]Okay, it must be added before planting.
[194:00.22]Oh, shit.
[194:01.04]Uh...
[194:02.41]Okay.
[194:03.27]Can we plant like a... I need to plant something here now.
[194:05.77]Do I have any seeds left?
[194:09.83]Shit in my pants.
[194:11.19]That is a wasted one.
[194:15.90]Alright, get rested up for the egg festival.
[194:19.12]That's really important.
[194:30.65]No, I need that.
[194:32.47]Okay.
[194:32.65]Let's get a good night's sleep.
[194:36.27]Time for the egg festival, guys.
[194:43.36]Oh boy, I'm excited.
[194:44.30]I thought that was a real dog.
[194:55.57]Don't worry, I won't forget.
[194:56.63]I'll get him.
[194:58.71]I'll water the dog.
[195:00.31]Don't worry, guys.
[195:07.23]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[195:08.21]Hey, you want some water?
[195:11.68]Yes, you do.
[195:12.14]Of course you do.
[195:13.66]Alright, egg festival.
[195:17.08]I am looking forward to this.
[195:18.48]By the way, I've had these pancakes in my inventory for about six days.
[195:25.68]At what point do they get old and gross?
[195:28.74]Today's festival is being set up.
[195:29.80]Come back later?
[195:30.42]I know, that's what I want to do.
[195:37.34]Do I have to kill, like, three hours again?
[195:39.95]Am I seriously going to be the guy that just stands outside of places and looks?
[195:50.61]Well, what else can I even do right now?
[196:01.46]Not much.
[196:01.86]I guess I can clear.
[196:03.12]I don't want to lose all my energy.
[196:07.13]I guess there's nothing much else I can do.
[196:14.71]Get rid of the stumps.
[196:18.61]There's my good dog.
[196:20.39]Hey, little good dog.
[196:21.79]Mr. Good Boy.
[196:23.13]Yes, you're Mr. Good Boy.
[196:24.03]I'm gonna assume it's 9am.
[196:28.80]Just throw that out there.
[196:35.28]Alright.
[196:36.30]Put this shit away.
[196:37.04]I need to pick up eggs.
[196:41.16]I'm gonna keep these, because I might need them.
[196:50.73]You never know when you're gonna need to smash somebody's skull with a pickaxe, so... I'm gonna keep that, too.
[197:05.96]Really?
[197:08.04]It's definitely 9 a.m.
[197:08.92]It has to be, right?
[197:10.16]There it is.
[197:10.62]Oh, here we go.
[197:12.56]Look at this stuff.
[197:15.30]I have $2, by the way.
[197:16.66]I should have saved up money.
[197:17.51]Oh, strawberry seeds.
[197:24.09]Shit.
[197:27.39]Oh, I want those so bad.
[197:34.78]Does this cost any money?
[197:36.52]Is it a free buffet?
[197:39.66]What is Super Mario doing?
[197:44.10]Fried eggs, boiled eggs, poached eggs, deviled eggs, scrambled eggs, chocolate eggs, you name it!
[197:48.55]Oh, I'm in heaven right now.
[197:49.77]And everybody's here.
[197:50.55]Look at all these friends.
[197:53.21]All these friends are here.
[197:55.03]Oh, wow.
[197:55.63]Who's this guy?
[197:59.56]How can you not be happy about eggs?
[198:06.84]This fruit punch is unusually good.
[198:11.76]Taking breaks from work can make you more productive in the long run.
[198:14.94]Yes, it can.
[198:15.44]I've been up since dawn coloring eggs.
[198:19.70]It's always my favorite part of the season.
[198:21.86]Well, this is where I can talk to everybody, right?
[198:23.36]Just make sure I click on every single person.
[198:27.73]Do you think everyone's ready for the egg hunt yet?
[198:29.23]No, not yet.
[198:31.41]I need to meet everybody in town here.
[198:38.52]Who am I missing?
[198:39.40]Who have I not talked to?
[198:40.26]Let's do rotten egg toss.
[198:45.30]I just need to make sure that you guys are all in my social circle.
[198:48.32]I don't care about anything else.
[198:49.38]Just add me on Facebook.
[198:51.06]That's all I care about right now.
[198:56.53]I don't think I bet you.
[198:57.25]Nope.
[198:59.13]What'd he say?
[199:00.13]I need that protein for my legs.
[199:05.59]Pam spiked the punch.
[199:10.98]I love this game.
[199:11.78]They're talking about eggs.
[199:13.78]And how good for you they are.
[199:16.06]They're right.
[199:16.58]Okay, hope I didn't talk to these people.
[199:24.90]Yeah, I always look forward to this shit.
[199:28.46]Yeah.
[199:30.39]I'm gonna kick all you guys' asses at this egg hunt.
[199:32.71]You don't even understand.
[199:33.61]I'm an expert at these things.
[199:38.79]Oh, Pam's shit-faced.
[199:43.89]Flint.
[199:44.15]I already talked to you.
[199:46.62]Okay.
[199:48.56]Only a couple more people over here.
[199:49.76]I've already met you.
[199:51.64]I don't think I met you.
[199:54.80]And I know you.
[199:55.36]Let's go on with the egg toss.
[199:59.02]I'm ready, Grandpa.
[200:00.99]Let's do it.
[200:04.89]Alright, everybody.
[200:06.57]Prepare yourselves.
[200:17.85]Alright, let's go.
[200:31.56]I'm ready.

[200:40.28]I'm winning this.
[200:42.30]Got one.
[200:43.94]Get out of here, you little punk.
[200:46.44]There's another one.
[200:48.50]How do I get back there?
[200:52.88]Can I cut the tree down?
[200:57.24]Give me that egg!
[201:00.04]I need to win this.
[201:04.05]I have to prove that I'm the best town person.
[201:11.15]Look at this idiot.
[201:11.77]He doesn't even know where he's going.
[201:13.69]I've already got four.
[201:17.76]What's the prize?
[201:21.75]You're gonna put an egg that close to the sewer?
[201:23.19]That's gross.
[201:26.75]One sec!
[201:26.99]Give me it!
[201:28.55]Fuck.
[201:28.97]Okay, I got six.
[201:34.00]I had to.
[201:34.36]Come on.
[201:34.64]I had to have won.
[201:35.20]I was going up against children for crying out loud.
[201:40.30]If only I could get you kids to pick up litter this efficiently, we'd have the cleanest town on this side of the green sea!
[201:47.46]And now, the winner of this year's egg hunt...
[201:52.20]Greg.
[201:53.80]No!
[201:55.16]How many did she get?
[201:56.20]What?
[201:59.52]Here's your prize, Abigail.
[202:00.76]What?
[202:01.08]I want a prize.
[202:01.74]That's it?
[202:07.26]That's it.
[202:15.01]I didn't even get to eat.
[202:18.55]What a waste of a day.
[202:23.12]Alright, goodnight.
[202:30.34]There's no way she could have gotten more than me.
[202:32.80]Somebody cheated.
[202:33.52]Somebody in the town is stacking the deck.
[202:35.20]Give me the watering can.
[202:48.11]I wish you told me how many she got.
[202:52.54]Then I would know for sure if it was a legitimate game or not.
[202:58.20]Oh, don't forget the dog.
[203:11.37]She was card counting.
[203:13.73]Yeah, she was.
[203:15.92]It's called bullshit, is what it's called.
[203:18.54]Alright, what's on the to-do list?
[203:23.36]Let's go meet the wizard.
[203:25.92]Meeting the wizard seems like a good use of my time.
[203:28.82]Wait a minute, hold on.
[203:31.86]Didn't I talk to everybody?
[203:38.54]There's still people I haven't talked to?
[203:44.18]I know the wizard's one of them, but... Goddamn.
[204:02.64]down I forgot how I got there last time a squirrel out of that tree you don't want to come down fine I almost ate the pancakes can I give the pancakes to the squirrel it'd be fun
[204:42.24]Mine the tree.
[204:44.50]I gotta go this way.
[204:49.86]Come to the egg festival.
[204:52.12]We're gonna let the children win, like always.
[204:55.16]When the adult should be winning.
[204:56.93]Look, I had more eggs.
[204:58.15]The adult should win.
[205:06.73]Keep going this way.
[205:07.55]Oh, bada-bing.
[205:10.39]Bada-boom.
[205:15.67]Still going the right way, I hope.
[205:19.23]I hope so.
[205:19.83]What's this traveling circus?
[205:27.13]Whoa.
[205:30.54]Albacore?
[205:31.06]A thousand gold.
[205:36.98]That's a lot.
[205:39.54]Cave carrot is worth a thousand?
[205:40.98]I don't understand.
[205:47.66]I think this woman might be a moron.
[205:50.54]She has two cave carrots that are identical.
[205:54.61]These are identical.
[205:55.65]One of them's a thousand.
[205:59.31]Did you just forget to cross this one off?
[206:01.53]Why is this one 600 gold more?
[206:02.69]Increases the chance of finding treasures.
[206:09.42]I don't want to put that on.
[206:13.54]I can't catch any fish.
[206:14.42]Why is this one 700?
[206:19.17]And a tomato.
[206:22.69]Oh, starfruit.
[206:27.36]Rare seed.
[206:29.48]Takes all season to grow.
[206:36.14]Well, what about, can I talk to the pig?
[207:00.55]There's a new pond I didn't see before.
[207:10.03]The Mario... Yeah, that was going like... What does this guy have to say?
[207:23.96]Ah, come in.
[207:26.30]He's got this fucking Satanic guy?
[207:28.22]Is it a satanist symbol?
[207:31.66]I am Rasmodius, seeker of the arcane truths.
[207:37.33]Mediary between physical and ethereal.
[207:40.19]Ethereal, ethereal.
[207:41.59]Master of the seven elements, keeper of the sacred.
[207:44.59]You get the point.
[207:48.19]And you, Greg.
[207:49.49]The one whose arrival I have long foreseen.
[207:51.27]Here, I'd like to show you something.
[207:58.99]Behold.
[208:02.22]Oh, it's these little things again.
[208:03.34]We're going to get some more... We're going to have some more lore?
[208:11.78]Yes, I have seen one before.
[208:16.75]The Junimos?
[208:20.65]Mysterious spirits.
[208:21.65]These ones, for some reason, they refuse to speak with me.
[208:23.73]Well, that's because you're, like, torturing one.
[208:31.72]No reason to fear them?
[208:32.54]Well, I've been killing them.
[208:34.34]I've been slashing them with a sword for about two hours now.
[208:37.20]Oh, he's going to talk about the scroll.
[208:46.47]This guy's going to disappear.
[208:49.09]See?
[208:49.79]Told you.
[208:51.61]I knew it.
[208:51.97]So what does it say?
[209:04.05]The language is obscure, but I was able to decipher it.
[209:06.41]What does it say?
[209:08.70]We, the Junimos, are happy to aid you.
[209:12.14]In return, we ask for gifts of the valley.
[209:13.84]If you're one with the forest, then you will see the true nature of this scroll.
[209:24.93]Yeah.
[209:25.17]I just want to go fishing and I want to plant seeds and shit.
[209:32.29]Sniff sniff.
[209:34.95]I thought he was gonna jump in.
[209:36.89]I thought he was actually jumping into the cauldron.
[209:41.07]Come here!
[209:47.61]My cauldron is bubbling with ingredients.
[209:50.39]Baby fern, moss grub, caramel, top toadstool.
[209:53.91]Can you smell it?
[209:56.26]Oh, it smells gross.
[209:58.12]Ugh.
[209:58.78]Am I actually gonna drink this shit?
[210:02.64]Can I refuse it?
[210:05.85]What a fucking idiot.
[210:06.45]Why would you do that?
[210:08.81]Why would you do something like that?
[210:10.60]He just met this guy five minutes ago.
[210:13.98]He killed me.
[210:17.42]He's gonna put me in his dungeon now.
[210:26.37]Okay.
[210:41.55]Did you see the trees?
[210:45.15]You gained the power of forest magic?
[210:50.55]This game keeps getting weirder and weirder.
[210:58.40]Okay.
[210:59.10]Well, thanks.
[211:00.98]Thanks for the weird drink, buddy.
[211:02.96]Appreciate it.

[211:12.91]Kill slimes.
[211:13.95]Still have to talk to people.
[211:20.91]Forest magic, aka going into the woods and eating drugs.
[211:24.76]Yeah, exactly, Ronnie.
[211:28.28]I guess I'll make a scarecrow.
[211:29.92]Seems like the next thing I should do.
[211:36.00]I wish I had my fishing pod.
[211:37.65]Fishing pod?
[211:39.53]Fishing rod.
[211:44.23]Back to the farm.

[213:10.97]It's like a rundown house over here.
[213:15.74]What is this?
[213:23.10]Whatever this once was, it's now in ruins.
[213:24.78]I'm assuming I can build something here eventually.
[213:28.33]Wow, what's this?
[213:31.83]A cave!
[213:32.13]I want a cave!
[213:40.10]What a crock of shit, there's nothing in this cave.

[214:35.82]What's the radius?
[214:36.50]Is that going to be good enough?
[214:43.68]That should... 8 tiles?
[214:45.06]1, 2, 3, 4... Yeah, that should do it, right?
[214:57.65]Sure.
[214:59.41]My gamepad disconnected.
[215:00.59]Yeah, that was... I don't know why.
[215:01.57]It was odd.
[215:03.17]Otto, what are you doing?
[215:07.49]Hey, real life dog, what are you doing over here?
[215:16.76]That cave is where you find Mewtwo after you beat the game.
[215:20.90]Well, that would be something.
[215:25.60]Wood fence.
[215:29.09]Okay, this is what we're doing.
[215:32.37]Plant a maple tree.
[215:33.79]Maybe I should just do that.
[215:37.47]That's what I'm gonna do.
[215:39.37]I'm gonna put that somewhere.
[215:47.44]Like, is this actually gonna grow?
[215:49.64]Did I need to, like, sow it?
[215:52.76]It doesn't say I needed to.
[215:53.66]Alright, we're gonna make another patch.
[215:58.87]We're gonna increase this patch.
[215:59.99]And what was this?
[216:02.15]I don't even know.
[216:03.31]This looks like shit, too.
[216:04.63]This looks so bad.
[216:05.51]I need to fix that up, too.
[216:10.01]I gotta do a lot of fixer-uppers.
[216:16.98]Let's go with this.
[216:20.60]Put the sword away.
[216:21.48]Nah, the pancake's gonna be put away.
[216:23.94]And the wood.
[216:25.32]And the stone.
[216:27.60]Give me the hoe.
[216:28.22]What are you chewing over here?
[216:32.40]Oh, he's got his little bone.
[216:33.14]Alright, let's make another field.
[216:38.63]Let's do it.
[216:42.58]That's going to be where I can do that.
[216:44.32]Over there, that one.
[216:46.50]And that's going to come over here.
[216:54.33]What crop is going to go right here?
[217:03.01]Something else is going to go right there.
[217:04.29]I'm going to put a fence down here.
[217:06.65]Huh!
[217:08.71]Huh!
[217:09.85]Huh!
[217:11.91]I almost forgot.
[217:13.63]I seriously almost forgot.
[217:15.64]I need to do this.
[217:16.24]I can't put a fence here if I don't have this.
[217:24.96]What does it take to make that?
[217:25.92]Like gravel?
[217:29.56]One stone.
[217:30.15]Okay.
[217:35.53]I need to finish that.
[217:37.95]Because it is a huge eyesore.
[217:42.80]It's just fucking awful.
[217:47.51]Plant C4 there.
[217:50.27]Something tells me that's not going to be in the game.
[217:53.63]But, you know.
[217:54.13]Do I have any stone in my... Big?
[218:07.58]Yeah, I do.
[218:11.45]Let's make some gravel.
[218:18.39]Okey-dokey.
[218:18.89]It's going to come down here like this.
[218:29.52]Straight down.
[218:30.16]Like this is going to come over here.
[218:50.47]Alright, it's coming along.
[218:53.07]It's coming along.
[218:58.55]I gotta go to town and get some stuff.
[219:02.37]Because I have fertilizer now.
[219:08.73]Jesus Christ, that looks like shit.
[219:26.16]No, it's this.
[219:26.86]It's these stupid things.
[219:27.96]They're ruining everything.
[219:30.24]They're going away.
[219:31.70]I'm redoing it.
[219:32.60]I'm going to redo it.
[219:33.70]Hold on.
[219:34.10]Hey, Rome wasn't built in a day, okay?
[219:40.60]It took them like seven days.
[219:46.66]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[219:50.52]Give me a second.
[219:51.52]It's time for bed.
[219:52.90]Do I have anything I can sell?
[219:58.12]I still have these pancakes.
[220:05.47]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[220:08.75]Morty Ragey.
[220:09.91]Morty Raggy.
[220:10.59]Whatever your name is.
[220:11.41]I think it's Morty Ragey.
[220:14.84]What's going on?
[220:15.32]Thanks for subbing.
[220:17.36]Welcome.
[220:20.32]Please don't rage at me.
[220:25.27]I'm going fishing tomorrow.
[220:26.19]And we're going to sell all kinds of fish.
[220:30.37]And then I'm going to buy more seeds.
[220:32.13]Hey, dog.
[220:40.08]Time to fish.
[220:50.45]Okey-dokey.
[220:53.79]I'm going to be spending a lot of time fishing, by the way, guys.
[220:57.17]I'll never rage at you, my love.
[220:59.63]Well, I appreciate that.
[221:01.64]Because I'll never rage at you either.
[221:04.80]But thanks for something.
[221:12.40]You know, I really like this game.
[221:14.85]Because... It's, um...
[221:21.51]I'm progressing very slowly.
[221:23.74]And I might be playing like shit right now.
[221:26.10]Like, I'm playing like shit.
[221:28.40]But it takes a long time to do things, and you kind of just have fun walking around, looking at stuff, getting crops, expanding your farm.
[221:39.59]This is fun.
[221:41.37]I'm enjoying this.
[221:45.26]Have I been watching this for four hours?
[221:47.84]Have I been playing for four hours?
[221:49.64]That's a shock to me.
[221:53.76]What is he doing?
[221:54.36]Look at his face.
[221:55.08]He gets all red.
[221:58.56]And his eyes turn black.
[222:04.06]You know what?
[222:04.44]Let's try to get a fish in here.
[222:10.20]I've subbed eight times and he's never said anything that thoughtful to me.
[222:12.90]Red Ranger.
[222:13.53]Oh, come on now.
[222:16.35]I've said many times that I thought that you were a fantastic person.
[222:24.87]Come on.
[222:30.51]More trash.
[222:31.09]Alright, we're doing one more try.
[222:32.88]I feel like there's only trash in here.
[222:36.54]Cast it.
[222:36.92]What are you doing?
[222:40.02]Those are his hands?
[222:40.88]Those don't look like hands to me.
[222:58.02]Alright, nothing but trash in here.
[223:00.96]Yeah, see, look, ready?
[223:02.40]I'm talking about above his hands.
[223:05.94]Those are his hands, but what's above the hands?
[223:08.16]His eyes turn black.
[223:12.30]See?
[223:13.56]See?
[223:14.98]Here, Grandpa, take a bunch of fucking garbage.
[223:18.67]Haha, dummy.
[223:19.33]Alright, I want to fish down here.
[223:24.65]Especially in this lake.
[223:34.03]You thought I was making the exclamation point sound?
[223:37.51]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[223:40.03]Not me.
[223:46.61]Grandpa doesn't want that shit.
[223:49.50]Well, he's gonna throw it away for me.
[223:51.88]I think of that thing as like a garbage can and a please sell this, Grandpa.
[223:55.40]I'm going to the lake over here.
[224:03.51]It's all about the fishing.
[224:10.89]What are we gonna get in this pond?
[224:16.51]Already?
[224:17.03]Wow.
[224:20.31]Gotta go, Jerma.
[224:20.94]Work tomorrow well.
[224:23.08]Good luck, Avenger, with your work.
[224:26.78]Hope you get a fucking raise.
[224:27.96]I hope you get a times ten raise tomorrow.
[224:32.59]Hold on, wait a minute.
[224:33.91]Water's bubbling over there.
[224:36.39]In my World of Warcraft days, it will tell me that that's where a fish is.
[224:40.73]Oh, come on!
[224:55.01]Lookit, there's like a bunch of bubbles!
[225:14.06]We got a hit.
[225:14.50]Oh, that was easy.
[225:23.48]Smallmouth bass.
[225:24.30]Wasn't somebody looking for... Somebody was looking for one of these, weren't they?
[225:33.27]Those bubbles are just somebody drowning.
[225:35.17]Ignore it.
[225:37.52]Well, now I can't ignore it.
[225:38.50]I'm gonna have to call the police.
[225:40.92]Where's the local sheriff?
[225:45.73]More trash.
[226:02.42]I still have no idea what this game is.
[226:03.92]It's a farming life simulator.
[226:08.90]You plant crops.
[226:09.88]You sell them.
[226:12.44]You pick up dirty newspapers.
[226:15.00]Alright, well those bubbles are gone.
[226:17.78]Geez, instantly.
[226:27.98]15 inches.
[226:30.86]It's not a rare one, but I'll take it.
[226:36.09]The guy drowned.
[226:38.09]Yeah, well, I guess it's not my problem anymore, is it?
[226:41.77]Never was my problem.
[226:49.44]More trash that I don't want.
[226:57.94]What would you class yourself in the morality scale?
[227:00.20]I have no idea.
[227:09.53]Maybe chaotic good, I would say.
[227:12.13]If I were to do it myself on a D&D sheet.
[227:20.89]Maybe.
[227:21.17]Although I haven't played Dungeons & Dragons in probably 10 years.
[227:32.27]And I played it one time.
[227:36.17]Annoying good.
[227:38.80]Did you just call me annoying?
[227:39.76]What the heck, man?
[227:41.98]Hey, Sally.
[227:46.90]No, I'm not looking... Look, here.
[227:47.82]Do you want to... Yeah, take a broken CD.
[227:53.41]Trust me, you'll like it.
[227:55.05]Who's on it?
[227:56.19]It's a Jojana 2.0 trial.
[227:57.51]Look, they don't even make these anymore.
[227:58.69]This is vintage.
[227:59.29]You can sell this on eBay.
[228:02.73]Ew, this is icky.
[228:05.75]Well, just sell it.
[228:06.74]Go sell it.
[228:14.38]Want more fish, please?
[228:25.63]Oh, he tried to sneak attack me right there, huh?
[228:30.91]I guess this is where the bass are, huh?
[228:32.75]Smallmouth bass.
[228:39.43]How do I like my grill?
[228:41.19]I'm not eating a grilled cheese.
[228:45.13]Although that doesn't sound too bad right now.
[228:53.11]I'm gonna change spots after this.
[228:54.77]There's probably gonna be another bass.
[229:01.28]And it is.
[229:01.66]Alright, moving on.
[229:04.50]New spot.
[229:10.14]Isn't there a lake or a river right here?
[229:12.10]Yeah.
[229:12.26]Let's go to the river.
[229:16.43]Cast a line right here.
[229:20.10]Why not?
[229:26.36]I can eat the algae, can't I?
[229:30.00]Yeah, just eat it and get some more energy.
[229:33.59]Just eat them all.
[229:43.02]Say smallmouth bass ten times fast.
[229:45.81]Smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass, smallmouth bass.
[229:58.73]Close.
[230:02.65]That actually helped a lot.
[230:07.97]I feel much more energetic from eating the algae.
[230:23.78]It's a new sunfish.
[230:24.60]Ooh, record.
[230:26.80]Whoops.
[230:27.60]No, that's fine.
[230:32.22]Stream Pepsi, man.
[230:35.78]Isn't that game where you just kind of run into traffic and push people over and stuff?
[230:39.85]Don't you just sprint?
[230:43.33]You run through people's houses and shit.
[230:45.51]Something like that.
[230:47.31]Something along those lines.
[231:02.24]Smell mouth ass.
[231:04.02]That's not what I was saying.
[231:09.75]Take off the duck bill, please.
[231:12.09]I don't think I can.
[231:12.77]I believe that's permanent.
[231:15.03]19 inch chub.
[231:26.92]New record.
[231:32.26]Maybe I'll make some money.
[231:33.20]Yeah, it's not part of me.
[231:41.85]I can't take it off.
[231:46.63]Wait.
[231:48.03]Okay, that's what that means.
[231:50.33]Cool.
[231:51.11]Shit.
[231:51.71]Alright, I...
[231:53.94]That's the first time I ever did that.
[231:55.82]So you have to do that and still catch the fish.
[231:58.78]I thought it was making me go up there and catch that instead.
[232:01.84]So fuck, now I know.
[232:03.12]Damn.
[232:03.53]I would have got it too.
[232:04.91]I would have got it.
[232:20.90]Boink.
[232:25.16]That's new.
[232:30.56]Last cast and I'm going to bed.
[232:38.62]Do I have enough inventory for the fishes?
[232:39.90]I believe I do.
[232:43.03]Drink that up right now.
[232:45.13]Yeah, I got plenty of room.
[232:51.87]Get me out of here.
[233:00.22]Yummy.
[233:02.48]One more for good measure.
[233:12.43]Grow your chub to 19 inches with this one weird trick.
[233:24.42]Here we go.
[233:26.26]Last fish of the evening.
[233:28.22]I'm gonna go make a grand.
[233:35.23]17-inch jib.
[233:36.05]Let's make our way back home.
[233:44.01]Still people I haven't talked to.
[233:45.07]I don't know how that's possible.
[233:46.10]I'm running out of quests.
[233:56.90]Gotta get more of those quests.
[234:03.43]Put these in the box.
[234:05.13]Go to bed.
[234:05.85]Buy more seeds.
[234:09.29]And then the cycle repeats itself.
[234:13.05]I got one more opportunity right here.
[234:14.25]Come on.
[234:25.92]Give me something good to eat.
[234:35.23]Just gonna throw that in the box for Grandpa.
[234:40.70]Maybe he'll appreciate it.
[234:43.50]Yeah, here's a bunch of dead fish.
[234:44.72]Oh, Grandpa, also, there's an energy drink in here for you now, too.
[234:55.65]Uh, there's more.
[234:57.59]Yeah.
[235:02.60]Okay.
[235:04.40]Let's go to bed.
[235:11.14]What did I make on those fish?
[235:12.06]Come on.
[235:12.26]Give me big money.
[235:12.84]Big money.
[235:13.22]What the fuck was that?
[235:16.60]I can put bait now?
[235:32.28]Not bad.
[235:33.85]Not a bad takeaway.
[235:34.81]At least now I can afford seeds.
[235:42.15]An explosion was heard in the night.
[235:45.73]Is this turning into Earthbound?
[235:52.22]Those are ready to pick up.
[235:55.20]Dear neighbor, I hope you are feeling settled in your new home.
[235:56.88]I am writing to let you know that Pierre's store is now selling fertilizers.
[236:01.26]I can make them.
[236:09.84]What the hell is this?
[236:14.61]This just crushed a bunch of shit!
[236:17.71]I'm coming to that realization right now.
[236:20.35]Are you serious?
[236:20.99]That took out half my crops.
[236:27.27]These things have taken... It has taken so long for these to grow, too.
[236:34.42]What on Earth?
[236:35.10]Why are there meteors in this game?
[236:40.61]Dog shit.
[236:41.33]I'm definitely not gonna be able to break it with this.
[236:46.92]Yeah.
[236:47.86]Now I have this giant eyesore in the way.
[236:49.42]There you go, buddy.
[237:01.43]Who's shit in here?
[237:02.37]Who pooped?
[237:02.83]Oh no, I planted that.
[237:07.17]Right.
[237:12.81]I don't even know where I can even put this.
[237:15.03]Does it have to be on tilled soil?
[237:17.49]It's out of season.
[237:20.13]So I can just hold onto it then, whatever.
[237:21.77]I'm gonna go buy, sell these cauliflowers and buy some seeds.
[237:33.72]Yeah, the moon, the moon came down.
[237:35.20]I got killed by my own moon.
[237:37.54]What are you eating over there?
[237:43.79]Quest.
[237:46.59]Require a sardine for potion making.
[237:50.35]Those are actually pretty easy to find on the dock.
[237:53.72]Oh my god, I have to sit here again.
[238:00.21]Some people would pay a lot of money to get a giant ugly rock in their yard.
[238:03.19]That's true.
[238:05.61]But how much?
[238:15.98]hey we can go in now and sell our things and buy more things I'm not controlling the character right now okay what's going on
[238:44.81]50% off your purchase at Jojo Mart?
[238:48.61]50%?
[238:48.75]Oh, he's trying to run him out of business.
[238:54.39]He's trying to run him out of business.
[238:56.84]What a dick.
[239:06.00]Oh, that's not... Alright, how much are we talking here?
[239:14.72]You can blame them.
[239:15.32]JoJo Corporation is clearly the superior choice.
[239:17.29]Soon the whole town will realize that.
[239:20.79]Oh my god.
[239:21.97]What a diabolical asshole.
[239:28.77]Should I go buy stuff at 50% off?
[239:36.70]How much do these sell for?
[239:38.00]Ooh, that's a lot.
[239:39.58]700.
[239:40.92]I will take that.
[239:44.74]That was a really good turnaround.
[239:45.76]I'm going to do cauliflower again.
[239:49.41]I think I had eight slots.
[239:56.07]Now, what about tulips?
[239:59.13]No, kale?
[240:02.68]Maybe we'll do kale.
[240:04.78]Yeah.
[240:05.90]Let's get some kale.
[240:12.64]See, I'm a good person.
[240:13.56]I bought from the independent guy.
[240:19.49]Had a huge loss for myself.
[240:22.11]But it's alright.
[240:22.53]We're gonna make a bunch of plants.
[240:25.31]Cherry bomb his house.
[240:29.89]I swear to god, if any more moons land on my property, I'm going to have a fit.
[240:39.94]Such bullshit.
[240:40.70]I can't even move it either.
[240:42.00]What a joke.
[240:42.58]Let's put the fertilizer down.
[240:47.21]Where's my fertilizer?
[240:47.99]This is... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[240:51.39]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 8.
[241:11.80]fertilizer okey dokey now what does this do okay so it makes it have a better chance for you to grow better crops I get it oh that's how we're gonna do it
[241:40.23]There it is!
[241:40.79]Maybe I'll get some good crops from this one.
[241:43.53]And over here... I can put a little bit of fertilizer down.
[242:00.38]Spring.
[242:12.56]Mmm, we got lots of money gonna be rolling in here soon.
[242:16.84]Lots of cash.
[242:17.66]Actually, I'm probably gonna laugh if a meteor lands on all this.
[242:24.62]There's like three meteors that land tomorrow.
[242:26.00]I'm just doing this because I have to.
[242:32.60]It needs to be all soiled up for me.
[242:38.78]I'm gonna water this too for fun.
[242:40.50]And this.
[242:42.98]And the dog.
[242:43.94]Alright.
[242:46.50]Okay.
[242:48.56]We're good to go.
[242:51.12]What's on the list?
[242:52.46]I could go on the mine.
[242:55.78]I could... I don't know.
[243:00.42]What do I want to do?
[243:08.12]What is what?
[243:10.44]Spring foraging bundle?
[243:14.32]exotic forging what the hell is all that I guess if you put those in the community center you get a bundle oh I just bumped the mic I'm sorry
[243:39.96]Alright.
[243:40.26]Uh, what do we got for a time in real life?
[243:43.50]7.30?
[243:43.52]7.30?
[243:43.90]Uh, is it 7.30?
[243:45.26]Yes, it is.
[244:12.21]Only four hours.
[244:16.73]Sardine.
[244:17.47]No, forget about the wizard.
[244:21.01]We got a scarecrow.
[244:29.44]Sounds like I got a maple seed out of the trash.
[244:30.94]Nice.
[244:40.05]Try casting a little bit more.
[244:43.68]I... If I get a sardine, I will go deliver it.
[244:49.76]Only if I get a sardine from here.
[244:51.04]I probably won't, though.
[245:01.07]Bass.
[245:03.77]Am I close enough to the ocean?
[245:10.02]Whoop!
[245:16.72]How much is a scarecrow again?
[245:25.95]Yeah, upgrade the pick.
[245:26.81]How do I upgrade the pick?
[245:27.63]I have to go to the blacksmith, right?
[245:33.00]How much money was that?
[245:33.84]Alright, I'm gonna upgrade the pick, and then I'm probably gonna stop streaming.
[245:41.96]So to upgrade the pick, I'm going to need money.
[245:44.75]So I'm going to have to sell the stuff I have or... Is that an egg?
[245:52.09]Whoa!
[245:52.33]I just got some berries out of that.
[245:57.78]Cool.
[245:59.48]What is sticking out here?
[246:07.38]Here.
[246:10.29]What?! !
[246:13.26]Are you serious?
[246:16.40]That was a fresh berry that I picked and I brought over to you.
[246:18.70]I thought you were going to be... Why does everybody hate everything?
[246:23.20]Everybody hates shit.
[246:25.28]No one has been happy of my gifts.
[246:27.93]Now, granted, half of them have been trash and garbage, but that was a good gift.
[246:39.37]Smells awful.
[246:41.75]That's all you can tell me?
[246:43.13]It smells awful?
[246:47.01]What a horrible town.
[246:52.97]Jeez.
[246:59.23]Sardine!
[247:00.89]Go for the sardine.
[247:03.23]You have to give them gemstones?
[247:10.19]Wow, so these guys have really expensive taste, huh?
[247:15.93]You know, I'm a townsperson, and I'm really friendly, but I only like people if they give me rare gemstones.
[247:25.52]You know what I mean, honey?
[247:29.74]You picked berries for me and gave them to me out of the kindness of your heart?
[247:33.55]I wanted an emerald.
[247:34.83]It's like deer.
[247:40.31]Come back when you get me a diamond, your lousy neighbor.
[247:46.81]Do I have anything I can give this guy?
[248:04.05]Here, take a fish.
[248:04.77]You want one of these?
[248:11.27]I'll put a fish on display for you.
[248:15.01]There you go.
[248:18.97]Where's the fish room?
[248:21.29]It doesn't exist.
[248:26.23]Fine.
[248:28.27]Well, you can just... Is that a... Is that dynamite?
[248:34.17]That's a book.
[248:34.59]Oh, there you go.
[248:35.80]There's another book.
[248:36.46]Bye.
[248:38.00]Bye.
[248:45.54]I need to get down.
[248:48.65]Down, down, down.
[248:50.81]Time to lean back again.
[248:51.79]Any more shit I can pick up?
[249:01.53]Ooh, oysters.
[249:02.95]Ooh!
[249:05.84]That's got a gold star on it.
[249:06.98]That's the first time I've seen that.
[249:15.90]cool I wonder what I can sell it for fire I wonder what's inside
[249:45.25]It's getting late.
[249:45.87]It's already in.
[249:49.75]Let me just turn this in immediately.
[249:51.88]Go back to the house.
[249:53.66]Oh, you stupid fish.
[249:54.68]Stop it.
[249:57.84]Stop doing that.
[250:02.20]Oh, what a red herring.
[250:04.14]What a red herring!
[250:06.53]That's gold too.
[250:07.23]Fuck, nice.
[250:10.09]I just realized what my character looks like.
[250:12.77]You want to know identical who this character is?
[250:15.95]It's Butthead from Beavis and Butthead.
[250:22.78]Exactly who it is.
[250:27.52]The shirt might even match too.
[250:42.12]I can cast my line farther than you, buddy.
[250:51.15]Shit.
[250:53.79]I wonder what happens when you get perfect.
[250:55.47]Does that just give you a higher chance of, um... My fishing must have gone up because I'm just getting a lot of rares and legendaries.
[251:22.95]Sardine.
[251:24.99]Shit.
[251:30.36]Running out of time.
[251:31.16]It's not the length of your fishing pole, it's how you use it.
[251:39.56]That's true.
[251:54.67]I think he's closed.
[252:01.87]This one's a real bastard.
[252:06.53]Seriously, this guy is a total bastard.
[252:08.35]18 inches.
[252:26.01]the other guy gave up he's just like I'm not catching anything I'm going to bed I got pretty much one more shot after this to get a sardine sardine no it's a herring come on like one or two attempts
[253:05.40]It's already in.
[253:06.58]It's already in.
[253:09.66]Maybe it's time of day.
[253:12.30]This is probably the last one before I gotta be careful.
[253:15.37]Of dying.
[253:19.45]Out in the wilderness in front of this guy's house.
[253:22.09]Gonna pass out in front of the guy's church.
[253:24.47]Wherever this is.
[253:25.81]Fish shop.
[253:33.49]Oh, the good thing is I'm gonna make a lot of money.
[253:36.79]These two goldfish should be... I got it.
[253:40.55]Okay, don't fuck this up.
[253:42.97]I got like a treasure chest.
[253:43.80]I don't know what the hell that is, but I'm going to find out right now.
[253:49.04]Halibut, 14.
[253:52.92]A bunch of coal.
[253:53.62]That's an awful treasure.
[253:56.19]That is not a good treasure.
[254:03.31]That's the type of thing that you would tell a little kid Santa Claus was going to give them.
[254:11.77]Sardine is a daytime fish.
[254:13.02]Yeah, I just figured.
[254:15.88]But this is my last seat.
[254:19.18]What did I do?
[254:21.20]Okay, let's go.
[254:22.60]Quickly.
[254:23.54]Back home.
[254:32.47]Yeah, why were the coals separate?
[254:34.31]It's probably something to do with RNG, like a roll or something.
[254:42.04]No, don't get stuck.
[254:50.28]It's gonna be close.
[254:51.86]I only have about... 20 minutes.
[254:56.89]Here she is again.
[254:57.53]She's always out late at night.
[255:00.03]What's your deal?
[255:05.83]Go.
[255:08.47]Go.
[255:10.31]Get in the house.

[256:29.63]What the hell is that?
[256:30.53]What is he talking about?
[256:33.53]I need money.
[256:40.62]Oh yeah, hub site!
[256:41.46]I'm gonna eat this.
[256:51.14]That's useful too.
[256:53.79]Last couple of fishes, close it up.
[256:55.33]Let's water our plants.
[257:04.25]I'm surprised that these are still not ready.
[257:08.15]How long did those have to take?
[257:10.17]It's kind of ridiculous.
[257:11.23]You know what I'm saying?
[257:17.43]Those things better be worth a lot.
[257:26.85]Drink it all in.
[257:35.29]Can I... What can I... Can... Yeah, let's, like, talk.
[257:39.57]Can the dog do anything else?
[257:40.49]I wonder what else the dog can actually do.
[257:50.69]Okay.
[257:53.42]Still people I haven't met.
[257:58.16]I'm gonna... I guess I'm gonna go visit... I don't have any money.
[258:00.64]So there's no point in me going to try to get a house when I have no money.
[258:06.50]So we're going to go pee again.
[258:11.40]In the game and in real life.
[258:16.83]Into my toilet.
[258:17.49]There it is.
[258:19.77]Alright.
[258:20.17]We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[258:21.97]Take a break.
[258:22.41]Take a bathroom break.
[258:25.75]I'll see you soon.
[260:55.72]Welcome back.
[260:57.94]When you piss in the game, you piss in real life.
[261:07.10]You know what?
[261:07.62]I know what you guys are hearing.
[261:08.74]You want to know what you guys are hearing?
[261:11.92]Would you like to know what you're actually hearing?
[261:14.86]You're hearing the drain.
[261:16.28]Because I'm downstairs right now in my place.
[261:20.60]And the drain is right here.
[261:22.54]Right?
[261:22.78]So it's like...
[261:24.52]Flowing down the drain.
[261:28.58]You understand?
[261:35.48]I'll give every excuse I need to give.
[261:41.78]No, that... Come on.
[261:48.31]Let's go.
[261:53.91]Yeah, it was a pretty good hydrated piss.
[261:55.51]It doesn't do that, no.
[262:00.23]Okay, what was I doing?
[262:03.09]What the hell am I doing?
[262:07.18]Something about a... Something about a York Peppermint Patty?
[262:10.88]Something like that?
[262:14.54]What is Doug Mendi... What is this guy's name again?
[262:17.98]Doug Bendigo?
[262:21.80]Why is my energy such shit?
[262:25.32]I don't get it.
[262:28.38]Just eat it.
[262:38.32]I just peed directly down the drain.
[262:39.90]Hmm.
[262:47.19]What did I want to do?
[262:48.17]Oh, this.
[262:48.61]Okay.
[262:50.67]I can make bait.
[262:51.35]Um...
[263:03.05]I'll go back in the mine.
[263:04.71]We're going to go back to bed, though.
[263:05.71]Time to go back to sleep.
[263:10.56]2.20pm.
[263:10.88]That's a good time to go to bed.
[263:14.74]Ooh, that's a lot of money.
[263:21.48]200 gold.
[263:22.56]Really?
[263:22.82]I feel like these would be a lot more.
[263:30.80]But I got a lot.
[263:31.70]That's enough for me to be able to continue on my quest to upgrade my pick.
[263:38.04]That's what it was going to be.
[263:38.90]Upgrade the pick.
[263:41.11]Just remembered.
[263:42.21]Just forget it out.
[263:52.91]Are these ready to pick up?
[263:55.24]What the hell?
[263:58.91]These things had better be worth a lot.
[264:03.51]My god!
[264:04.39]Yeah, that's probably true.
[264:27.93]This is sort of like a next-gen Harvest Moon.
[264:38.05]Okay.
[264:39.63]Time to go upgrade the pick.
[264:43.19]Still might need a few hundred bucks.
[264:47.42]Let's go look at the job board and see what we can do.
[264:59.07]Is there anything we can do?
[264:59.79]There is something.
[265:07.74]Oh, it's Pam's birthday.
[265:10.32]Pam's birthday today, right now.
[265:12.44]And she should be liking me.
[265:16.66]I can do that.
[265:17.13]Don't I already have one?
[265:17.87]I gave it to Grandpa.
[265:20.57]It's alright, I'll fish one out of the ocean for him.
[265:22.99]Oh, it's her birthday.
[265:24.97]What can I give her?
[265:28.49]Okay, I'll come back.
[265:30.91]She's definitely gonna be in there.
[265:34.73]Two thousand gold and five copper bars.
[265:36.93]That's a lot!
[265:40.56]Let's get this guy coke.
[265:41.44]I can either buy one from Jojo Mart or I can fish one out of a lake.
[265:51.56]Am I really gonna start dating Pam?
[265:53.76]Is that what's gonna happen?
[266:04.51]Have I gone to this lake yet?
[266:05.58]I'm not going to give her a copper nugget.
[266:10.88]She hated that last time.
[266:11.98]Yeah, it was her, right?
[266:13.08]No, it was the little girl.
[266:13.96]Ooh, somebody.
[266:23.45]Look at that.
[266:24.59]First try.
[266:26.79]Who wanted this?
[266:29.51]Pierre.
[266:30.49]Yeah, the guy in the shop.
[266:31.59]Look at that.
[266:32.11]First try.
[266:35.90]I knew it was gonna happen, guys.
[266:37.58]I knew it.
[266:42.38]Where's this shop?
[266:43.01]Oh, it's right in front of me.
[266:49.97]Hey, Pierre, I've got something for you.
[266:53.09]It's a Nuka-Cola.
[266:56.99]Here you go.
[266:59.20]Hey, it's like a judge call.
[267:00.28]Oh, thanks so much.
[267:01.62]I can't even leave to buy a 75 cent drink.
[267:04.06]Thanks.
[267:04.34]Here's what I owe you.
[267:05.20]A fucking hundred bucks.
[267:12.24]I really appreciate that, even though I probably sell these here.
[267:21.34]Okay.
[267:22.88]Look, this guy's got to have some respect for me at this point, right?
[267:27.96]I bought... I had... There was like two or three opportunities where this guy would like me.
[267:32.52]I purchased shit from his store when the big money business guy came in.
[267:37.18]I got him a Coca-Cola when he wanted it.
[267:38.94]Immediately.
[267:40.81]And nobody likes me.
[267:41.57]Why doesn't y'all like me?
[267:43.81]Why does nobody like me?
[267:49.37]You think that'd be one out of ten by now?
[267:54.74]I don't get it.
[267:57.83]Let's toss the old pigskin around, man.
[268:02.29]Come on.
[268:03.29]Toss it at me.
[268:07.14]I just want to make friends.
[268:09.08]Why does nobody want to be my friend?
[268:10.20]Let's go kill some slimes.
[268:12.96]I don't even have a sword on, do I?
[268:15.68]No.
[268:15.90]Well, I did that quest.
[268:20.07]What do I do?
[268:21.05]I need to wait for my crops to come out so I can make money.
[268:23.45]What the hell are you doing?
[268:31.43]It's also Pam's birthday in an hour.
[268:33.39]Alright.
[268:36.80]I'm going to bite the bullet here.
[268:39.82]Once this is open and once I can go in... I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna buy Pam a drink.
[268:48.15]She's always in the bar.
[268:49.91]She's always hanging out here.
[268:52.01]I'm gonna buy her a drink.
[268:53.73]It's 400 gold.
[268:56.35]And I'm going to give it to Pam.
[268:58.71]Happy fucking birthday.
[269:10.03]So we're going to wait.
[269:10.53]This place is empty.
[269:24.60]I guess, can I just wait outside the door?
[269:26.30]Is this the bartender?
[269:30.42]Yeah, I could.
[269:31.68]Get over here, quick.
[269:32.84]Come on.
[269:35.26]Hey, don't go out all day.
[269:37.18]Let's go, buddy.
[269:40.59]Look at that.
[269:41.05]It took him 30 minutes to walk out of his bedroom to the front.
[269:45.94]Unbelievable.
[269:48.26]That's just unbelievable.
[269:54.56]Give me something.
[269:56.56]Do I have to stay on the other side?
[269:57.75]Okay.
[270:00.55]400 gold.
[270:02.93]Buy it.
[270:04.39]Pam, happy birthday.
[270:07.57]Where are you?
[270:09.65]Come here.
[270:13.38]No, it's Penny.
[270:16.64]But you don't have Pam.
[270:21.04]Pam, you in here yet?
[270:24.58]No.
[270:26.92]Where is she?
[270:32.67]Here's this dude.
[270:35.45]I can't talk right now, young.
[270:36.71]Should I give it to this guy?
[270:42.47]What's going on with this TV?
[270:46.53]This seems like a fire hazard.
[270:54.86]Okay, you've had enough time.
[270:55.94]You're definitely in here now.
[270:59.32]Nobody's even... I have to track her down.
[271:04.30]It's 2 o'clock.
[271:05.18]We're getting later on in the day.
[271:08.71]Where is she?
[271:12.72]If I don't find her, I just spent $400 on a beer.
[271:18.68]Come on.
[271:20.46]Do you live in one of these houses?
[271:26.89]No.
[271:28.55]She lives in the trailer?
[271:30.95]Well, she's gonna come to the bar.
[271:36.64]Let's go this way.
[271:41.55]Yeah, RIP 400 gold.
[271:42.39]If I can't find this... I'm starting to get angry.
[271:48.82]I'm starting to get really mad at this stuff right now.
[271:54.23]I'm gonna flip out.
[272:00.81]And away we go.
[272:01.79]Okay.
[272:05.23]There she is.
[272:06.31]Hey, I know you're working right now.
[272:09.11]I had one too many caramel porters at the saloon last night.
[272:11.68]Go away.
[272:17.14]Can I interest you in a drink?
[272:22.42]I feel like I shouldn't give this to... Why did she tell me to go away?
[272:24.70]I have to be nothing but nice to this person.
[272:29.21]I've been nothing but nice.
[272:30.67]And I brought her a drink at work.
[272:33.65]And she tells me to go away.
[272:41.02]What happens if I give this to her?
[272:42.16]Maybe I shouldn't do it right now.
[272:47.24]I'm going to wait until she gets off work and she's in a better mood.
[272:49.54]Is she leaving?
[272:52.96]Where's she going?
[272:54.86]Follow her.
[272:55.74]Follow her.
[273:01.82]You're gonna accept this beer.
[273:04.00]At some point.
[273:06.38]Here's she going.
[273:08.50]Good afternoon, Abigail.
[273:11.95]Why are you so nice to her?
[273:14.59]She told me to fuck off and she's telling her have a nice day.
[273:20.65]What did I ever do to you besides nice things?
[273:25.92]I've done at least one or two errands for this person.
[273:31.28]There she goes.
[273:32.32]She's going to the bar.
[273:33.84]Okay, here's my chance.
[273:35.18]Here's my chance.
[273:35.64]Okay, here we go.
[273:38.06]Give me the usual.
[273:39.00]Yeah, I got you.
[273:40.92]I got you.
[273:42.30]Don't worry.
[273:44.32]Oh, is it my birthday today?
[273:45.38]I guess it is.
[273:45.92]Thanks.
[273:46.24]This is nice.
[273:48.60]Yeah, you're very welcome.
[273:51.16]Oh, she's... I've been looking forward to this beverage all afternoon.
[273:58.31]Three out of ten.
[274:00.13]Three out of ten.
[274:03.39]Me and Pam are gonna be hanging out.
[274:05.82]She's gonna be my best friend.
[274:09.74]See, she already likes me.
[274:10.54]She's the only person in town that likes me.
[274:13.10]Nobody else does.
[274:16.26]Zero out of ten.
[274:18.62]Zero out of ten.
[274:22.24]Should I buy her another drink?
[274:24.34]Do I have enough money?
[274:25.68]Can I sell anything to, like, buy another beer?
[274:27.48]Yeah, I'm gonna buy her a salad, too.
[274:30.08]Here, here you go.
[274:32.26]Hey, look, I bought you a drink, and here's a nice dinner.
[274:36.95]I've already given Pam a gift today.
[274:39.43]Oh, shit.
[274:40.39]Well, it's her birthday.
[274:43.59]I should be able to... Well, here, I just bought a salad for you.
[274:45.70]Yeah, you're welcome.
[274:50.34]You fucking don't like me.
[274:53.67]Alright boys, Pam it is.
[274:55.45]She's the only friend I'm gonna have.
[275:00.34]That's our only friend.
[275:13.50]Hello, Greg.
[275:15.88]What the hell am I doing now?
[275:18.10]Besides getting shit on and spending almost a thousand gold for no reason.
[275:28.08]You think it's the duckbill?
[275:29.90]It probably is.
[275:30.90]Could be.
[275:36.47]I'm supposed to be saving money, too.
[275:40.43]Well, time to go fishing again.
[275:41.59]Time to go fishing, guys.
[275:56.70]I can, like, invite her over for dinner.
[275:59.55]We're just gonna drink beers for dinner.
[276:01.05]Hey, you wanna come over for dinner?
[276:03.45]Yeah, I'm just serving beer.
[276:05.41]That's it.
[276:07.33]In an edible glass.
[276:13.57]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[276:18.43]Madman7.
[276:20.90]Subscription hype.
[276:21.92]Subscription hype.
[276:23.44]Sub hype.
[276:25.68]Thanks.
[276:27.08]Thank you, I appreciate it.
[276:30.78]I appreciate the support.
[276:33.96]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[276:35.48]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[276:37.46]You didn't, I was bowing there, thank you.
[276:39.92]Give me the trash.
[276:42.76]Everybody throws out maple seeds for some dumb reason.
[276:46.65]Why?
[276:47.33]They're useful.
[276:51.29]I'm just gonna sit here and fish.
[276:54.23]Until it's bedtime.
[276:57.30]And then please, God, can I sell the crop that's on the left.
[277:01.57]And then have some money.
[277:03.43]Go into the mine.
[277:04.03]That's not what I wanted.
[277:14.19]Invite Pam over for champagne?
[277:15.35]I would.
[277:16.71]If she would come over.
[277:17.39]This one's gonna be perfect.
[277:23.68]Perfect.
[277:23.96]Come on.
[277:24.30]Perfect.
[277:25.94]Perfect!
[277:35.96]Has Jerma's Farm improved over the two hours since I've been gone?
[277:38.44]Have the beans grown?
[277:39.46]The beans have not grown.
[277:40.98]In fact, they were crushed by a giant alien boulder.
[277:49.08]A meteor hit my farm and it landed on those beans.
[277:52.45]So, who knows if they'll ever grow at this point.
[277:57.77]Ooh.
[277:59.67]Fuck.
[278:01.51]Come on, get up there so I can open that.
[278:07.36]Come on, come up here.
[278:08.24]Get up here.
[278:08.82]Thank you.
[278:11.24]Shit.
[278:13.52]Is my line gonna break?
[278:14.48]I hope not.
[278:16.10]I need to get this almost full before I go back up.
[278:21.62]Got it.
[278:21.84]Alright, something good out of that chest.
[278:28.27]Give me money.
[278:29.63]Somebody, some pirate had to throw a bunch of fucking gold in the trash, right?
[278:34.99]Bait.
[278:40.85]Can I attach these?
[278:47.98]How do I attach this?
[278:55.66]Is there a way I can put that on the fishing pole?
[279:00.22]Or does it do it automatically?
[279:01.42]I guess not.
[279:07.24]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[279:08.70]It's getting late.
[279:10.84]Hopefully I have beans to pick up.
[279:12.80]Ooh!
[279:14.91]Nope.
[279:15.15]No, no, no.
[279:15.41]Let me try it again.
[279:20.13]Almost, almost.
[279:24.95]Nice.
[279:25.19]That's two in a row.
[279:32.89]Ooh!
[279:35.25]Whoa!
[279:38.39]A diamond.
[279:40.33]I got a diamond.
[279:43.20]And I got a level 11 dagger.
[279:48.54]This has got to be worth something.
[279:52.90]What do I do with this?
[279:54.04]Should I sell it?
[279:54.56]Should I throw it in the trash?
[279:55.48]Like give it to my grandfather?
[279:58.40]Should I donate this?
[280:02.41]We're going to be rich.
[280:06.28]I knew I should have stayed up past my bedtime and fished.
[280:09.87]Right in the spot.
[280:10.51]This is the spot right here, dudes.
[280:15.53]Give it to Pam?
[280:17.57]No, I am not giving Pam a diamond.
[280:22.77]Or am I?
[280:26.05]Am I gonna give Pam a diamond?
[280:31.32]I kind of want to look it up and see how much it's worth, because if it's worth like 5,000 gold, I'm not giving it to somebody.
[280:36.70]It's mine.
[280:39.54]As Gollum would say.
[280:44.35]We want shit.
[280:45.31]We need shit.
[280:47.67]Filthy hobbitses.
[280:49.81]Don't touch my fucking diamond.
[280:54.72]We want shit.
[280:55.74]We need shit.
[280:56.62]We want shit.
[281:05.00]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[281:12.46]How much is it worth?
[281:14.77]750?
[281:14.79]750?
[281:16.07]Am I gonna go propose to Pam?
[281:23.43]Sell it and buy Pam two drinks.
[281:32.50]It's a fucking diamond.
[281:35.95]I can't believe that's true.
[281:37.87]A diamond is enough to buy two beers at the saloon.
[281:44.11]So what would you rather have, Pam?
[281:46.21]Two cheap light bud lights or a diamond?
[281:52.39]A cut diamond?
[281:55.67]Well, you know, I probably would go for the diamond, maybe.
[281:58.95]No, I'll take the two beers.
[282:01.49]What do you want?
[282:01.97]Leave me alone.
[282:02.62]What the fuck?
[282:05.86]Here, take a piece of driftwood.
[282:07.18]Feel better.
[282:07.60]I don't like this.
[282:11.24]Well, then, here.
[282:12.14]Take some fucking algae.
[282:15.71]Fuck off.
[282:17.29]Everyone's such a dick.
[282:19.75]Does everybody have to be so mean?
[282:24.26]Get four salads.
[282:25.16]Think about your options here.
[282:26.06]You can get four salads.
[282:32.75]Last chance.
[282:33.13]Come on.
[282:34.73]1230.
[282:35.85]There's definitely something weird in here at like midnight or after midnight.
[282:38.69]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[282:42.63]Before I pass out.
[282:43.15]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[282:45.35]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[282:46.31]Give me, give me, give me.
[282:48.05]Give me.
[282:49.69]Give me.
[282:50.81]Oh, it's a newspaper.
[282:53.75]Shit.
[282:54.27]Go.
[282:56.15]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[283:01.29]Come on.
[283:03.13]Come on, I gotta dump these things.
[283:05.12]No, I don't want to dump the diamond.
[283:08.36]Uh, do I have anything else?
[283:11.36]Yeah, I do.
[283:15.06]Okay, go to bed.
[283:16.98]Get in bed.
[283:19.12]Get in bed.
[283:20.24]Ah, made it.
[283:23.34]Level three fishing.
[283:25.32]Crab pot?
[283:28.88]Okay.
[283:36.84]30 gold for a sunfish?
[283:41.09]Alright.
[283:42.07]This should be the day that I have crops able to be picked up.
[283:48.93]At least I hope so.
[283:51.65]These are still not ready.
[283:55.05]These things are fucking still not ready.
[284:02.76]Guys, wait a second.
[284:08.38]I think they are ready.
[284:11.08]I think they've been ready for a long time.
[284:19.11]I think they've been ready for a real long time.
[284:28.04]Right?
[284:28.44]I think I'm supposed to do... Shit.
[284:31.82]I was really, really cocky right there.
[284:33.78]I thought for real that was what the...
[284:39.71]I was wrong.
[284:40.43]It's okay.
[284:42.83]I was wrong.
[284:50.19]Sometimes you're wrong.
[284:56.73]So what the fuck is taking those so long?
[284:58.59]Oh, I'm so angry about that.
[285:00.35]I'm so mad about that.
[285:01.58]Why is it taking so long?
[285:04.64]Are those 12 days or something?
[285:07.54]It's crazy.
[285:11.09]I need to expand, I need money.
[285:12.99]I need to get this off my lawn.
[285:19.63]Hey kid, here's the recipe for a little treat my pappy used to make.
[285:23.41]Cook it slow, cheese curls.
[285:25.57]Uh, how are you doing, sweetie?
[285:30.51]I've missed you so much since you left.
[285:31.78]I hope the farming life is everything you hoped for.
[285:34.48]Aw, cookies, thanks, Ma.
[285:36.50]Aw, I love you, Ma.
[285:39.78]I have a request for you.
[285:40.58]I need fresh cauliflower for a recipe I want to make.
[285:42.78]Could you bring me... No, I can't.
[285:46.20]Because I just... They're not ready.
[285:49.40]How many days is that?
[285:50.10]Bring me some raw materials.
[285:57.26]Maybe I can expand your house.
[286:01.74]Kitchen.
[286:02.64]Oh.
[286:05.89]There's too much to do and not enough crops being made.
[286:08.65]Okay, and you know what we're doing?
[286:13.41]Guess who the cookies are going to.
[286:17.35]Guess who's getting these cookies.
[286:18.33]That would be Pamela.
[286:31.35]Pam's getting these cookies.
[286:36.57]Special delivery.
[286:38.42]Is this her house?
[286:44.20]Wait, what is it?
[286:48.20]There she is.
[286:51.86]You know, I've been thinking.
[286:52.64]I wish I had a hobby.
[286:53.50]Something to do other than hanging around at that saloon every night.
[286:56.86]Well, I got something for you.
[286:59.66]Here's some cookies.
[287:04.08]You did good with this one, kid.
[287:05.60]Thanks.
[287:10.39]Come on.
[287:10.83]Do you have any ideas?
[287:19.92]Fishing?
[287:20.28]I just gave you cookies.
[287:30.11]Does she like me enough?
[287:30.79]Can I go in her room?
[287:34.55]Whose house is this?
[287:37.65]You're not good enough friends with Penny to enter her bedroom.
[287:40.07]So why are you here?
[287:43.71]What?
[287:44.45]Where do you actually live?
[287:45.77]And why are you just sitting on somebody's couch watching TV?
[287:48.45]Enough of this.
[287:49.71]Come with me.
[287:50.15]Come on.
[287:53.09]Let's go.
[287:53.55]Get up.
[287:57.67]You see what's on my head right now?
[288:00.64]This could be yours.
[288:02.54]You could get one of these too.
[288:04.70]All you gotta do is follow me.
[288:06.58]Come on, Pam.
[288:08.48]Come on, Pam.
[288:11.26]Oh, Jesus.
[288:12.90]I thought I, like, stabbed her in the face.
[288:19.18]That's her daughter?
[288:20.72]She doesn't have a room in the house?
[288:26.55]Hey, Grandpa, look what I got.
[288:28.95]No, I'm not giving him a diamond.
[288:33.81]Come here.
[288:37.69]Am I wasting energy?
[288:38.47]Hey, look what I can do.
[288:44.43]I don't know you.
[288:46.24]Well, here's a stuff for your science class.
[288:52.46]It's a gift I gave you.
[288:53.58]It's maple seeds.
[288:54.54]See, watch.
[288:55.04]You go like this.
[288:59.31]She just left.
[289:02.63]I wasn't done talking to you.
[289:06.58]Come back here.
[289:08.19]Hey, you kids.
[289:11.77]You digging the dirt?
[289:14.69]Yeah, yeah.
[289:15.91]Let's have a seat.
[289:17.73]Let's talk about things kids like.
[289:20.73]Do you like diamonds?
[289:23.59]Little Victor, do you like diamonds?
[289:26.25]What about knives?
[289:29.48]You want some bait?
[289:33.32]What if I gave this to him?
[289:34.94]He'd probably shit his pants.
[289:38.41]This guy would absolutely shit his pants.
[289:39.65]He's gonna shit his pants.
[289:40.59]I'm gonna do it.
[289:41.67]No, I'm not.
[289:42.11]Fuck that.
[289:43.17]What if I get another one?
[289:46.18]This is going to Pam.
[290:03.31]Tomorrow, I'm going into the... No, we're going back to the mine.
[290:06.12]I have a lot of space.
[290:06.78]I have a lot of room.
[290:07.31]I'm going to just mine the shit out of everything.
[290:19.05]I'm going to eat this.
[290:19.75]Just eat it right now.
[290:25.53]The whole thing.
[290:26.18]Even his bladder.
[290:29.86]And let's make our way to the mine.
[290:31.10]I have plenty of room.
[290:32.90]I've got a lot of room.
[290:35.81]Just don't lose the diamond.
[290:42.37]That is so depressing.
[290:45.89]Pam is the only person in the whole town that wants me to exist.
[290:53.25]I've given this person two gifts this week.
[290:57.40]Everybody hates me.
[290:59.74]And even the person that I've been courting, that I've been talking to and spending a lot of time with still barely even likes me.
[291:04.44]It's a 3 out of 10.
[291:07.09]You rate somebody a 3 out of 10 if you really don't like them and you don't ever want to see them.
[291:16.51]That is an insult to be a 3 out of 10.
[291:20.84]I should be insulted.
[291:29.64]Oh, that's how you dig.
[291:39.70]Well, let's go to the mine.
[291:40.60]Hopefully I can get some shit.
[291:46.14]Can I get up there this way?
[291:52.66]Gonna wrap around.
[291:53.46]Wait, and Pam isn't single?
[291:56.29]What do you mean Pam's not single?
[291:57.43]What are you talking about?
[292:01.75]She's using me for the free beer?
[292:03.07]Are you kidding me?
[292:04.43]How do you know this?
[292:04.99]What's your source?
[292:08.77]What's your source?
[292:11.11]Get out of the way.
[292:11.97]Get out of my fucking way.
[292:14.87]I'm a little sore from work yesterday.
[292:16.51]I've already given her a gift today.
[292:24.32]That's how generous I am, guys.
[292:25.58]I don't even remember giving her a gift.
[292:30.30]Apparently I've given her something.
[292:33.24]Sorry I was so cranky and I screamed at you for being alive and living in the town and giving us crops.
[292:44.39]Let's make our way back down.
[292:46.50]What exactly do I want to do?
[292:50.34]Three iron.
[292:52.47]I just have to progress down and pick up stuff.
[292:57.29]I could use a torch too.
[292:58.69]Let's go.
[293:12.57]There's a new enemy down here.
[293:13.91]I have a trident, though.
[293:16.71]Insta-kill.
[293:19.17]This is so much better than what I had before.
[293:20.90]This is a joke how much better this is.
[293:25.34]Really.
[293:32.59]What a joke.
[293:32.99]It used to take me a full 60 seconds to kill these things.
[293:40.94]Although it doesn't have a slash, it's a stab.
[293:44.26]Whatever, who cares?
[293:44.96]Uh-oh.
[293:49.66]Starting to run out of light.
[293:57.91]It's just gonna get progressively darker, isn't it?
[294:02.55]I would assume.
[294:03.28]I would assume.
[294:08.82]Take that.
[294:17.44]excellent time is it five I got plenty of time I got all the time oh journal updated what I get you successfully dispatched 10 slimes now you can enter the adventurers guild now there's like a bunch of different groups doesn't matter which one I join is this like a Dark Souls covenant

[295:03.92]What level is this on the miner's map?
[295:11.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[295:12.74]Easy, easy.
[295:17.73]Cherry bomb.
[295:19.82]Interesting.
[295:20.26]Hmm, interesting.
[295:24.60]You have a good day now.
[295:36.08]Well, I'm gonna have plenty of stone.
[295:47.02]This is a narrow corridor.
[295:54.14]Boink, boink.
[295:55.24]Ooh, a Geodude.
[296:02.00]How much copper do I have?
[296:03.58]And what is it?
[296:04.10]Two.
[296:04.44]Oh, I'm almost out of energy.
[296:05.50]Hold on, slow down.
[296:10.48]Do I have anything else to eat?
[296:16.65]Uh, I don't think so.
[296:19.61]Man, I ran out fast.
[296:22.47]That was real fast.
[296:25.44]I gotta get out of here.
[296:28.52]I gotta get out of here.
[296:31.90]One more, one more jewel.
[296:34.84]Alright, get me out of here.
[296:35.58]No, I can kill these things and get some EXP bonuses.
[296:45.48]Alright, go.
[296:46.77]Out, out, out, out, out.
[296:49.67]Out with it, out with it.
[296:53.05]Out with it.
[296:54.05]Where are your friends?
[296:56.53]Where are your friends?
[297:00.45]Perfect.
[297:03.55]Now hopefully I can sell some shit.
[297:07.62]Alright.
[297:07.92]I need to give me a second here.
[297:11.24]Hold on.
[297:11.52]I'm going to get to the house first.
[297:13.18]No, I can pause it.
[297:14.58]I'm going to make a pole.
[297:15.28]I'm going to do a straw pole here, guys.
[297:17.34]This is very important.
[297:26.60]Extremely important.
[297:45.03]Okay.
[297:50.41]Here is the straw poll is extremely important.
[297:57.88]What do I do?
[298:01.72]I gotta get rid of this thing.
[298:08.08]Wow, unanimous.
[298:10.49]This is unanimous.
[298:14.47]Already 75% sell that shit.
[298:15.67]Only 25% want me to give it to Pam?
[298:16.75]That's funny.
[298:30.72]That is pretty funny.
[298:36.13]It belongs in a museum.
[298:39.55]No, I'm not giving it to a museum.
[298:40.81]That's a lot of cash.
[298:43.67]That's a ton of cash.
[298:47.37]That's the amount of cash between not getting strawberry seeds and getting strawberry seeds.
[298:55.88]You understand?
[298:59.30]You understand here?
[299:02.72]Alright, well, unanimously, it looks like we're going to be doing that.
[299:08.98]So thank you for voting.
[299:12.25]Even if a bunch of people decide right now, we're going to get rich.
[299:17.35]So let's get rich.
[299:24.77]Oh, hold on.
[299:25.25]I screwed something up.
[299:26.43]There we go.
[299:28.07]Now I can see.
[299:33.11]Should I just put it in the trash?
[299:34.79]I feel like somebody's going to steal that out of the dumpster.
[299:37.99]Won't somebody steal that?
[299:43.19]Wait a minute.
[299:43.53]Isn't somebody in here?
[299:45.27]There's that little guy.
[299:49.98]Let me just go in here for a second.
[299:53.42]Didn't I learn magic?
[299:58.34]Crafts room?
[300:00.94]Oh, that's what this is.
[300:03.63]Okay.
[300:06.01]I get it.
[300:19.69]The museum will give you money?
[300:22.07]How much?
[300:25.21]Top dollar?
[300:25.69]If it ain't top dollar, then I'm not sure I want to be interested.
[300:33.12]We'll see tomorrow morning.
[300:41.61]We'll see when we wake up what I decide to do.
[300:52.80]Sleep tight, crops.
[300:55.84]See you in the morning.
[301:03.49]What's going on?
[301:11.38]Something tells me I'm not doing something right and I can actually pick these up now.
[301:17.06]Am I crazy or what?
[301:19.09]These have been here for so long that I feel like I am an insane person.
[301:40.45]Am I an insane person?
[301:43.59]I don't know.
[301:50.25]You could give it to Pam, see if it gives you seven hearts, and if she doesn't, murder her and hide the body.
[301:56.88]Just, like, hit man.
[301:59.12]Have to, like, drag her into a ditch somewhere.
[302:01.88]And, like, some guy sees me do it, and he's like, hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[302:05.50]And I kill him and then hide him in a bush, too.
[302:10.44]And I progressively end up killing everybody in the town.
[302:14.20]By the way, dog is just stuck over there.
[302:16.56]Get out of there, dog.
[302:18.71]Yeah, I'll help you.
[302:20.19]Alright, go.
[302:24.55]You're free.
[302:34.25]I feel like I'm doing something wrong here.
[302:38.45]Alright, let's... So I get money if I give it to the museum?
[302:46.31]Assume her identity.
[302:48.21]Alright, I got one shot at this.
[302:56.86]I'm just curious as to what it's worth.
[302:58.14]I'm not gonna sell it.
[303:00.36]Oh my god, will you just open the doors?
[303:10.53]Oh, damn!
[303:11.09]Yeah, let's do that!
[303:13.41]Don't I have that?
[303:15.49]Oh, yeah!
[303:16.21]Fuck yeah!
[303:17.05]Fuck yeah!
[303:17.77]Fuck yeah!
[303:18.45]Fuck yeah!
[303:23.02]He gives them back!
[303:23.90]How long do I have?
[303:29.88]Two days?
[303:30.32]I already got it!
[303:31.56]I already got it!
[303:32.26]You know what I'm saying?
[303:35.77]Copper ore, look at that!
[303:36.73]Already done.
[303:41.30]What is this talking about?
[303:45.54]Let's go do that right now.
[303:48.60]Where's Clint?
[303:49.90]Blacksmith?
[303:58.08]20 ore.
[304:01.97]I'm locked into something else.
[304:04.47]I'm locked in, guys.
[304:05.65]I'm ready.
[304:07.41]Whose house is this?
[304:09.57]Okay, here we go.
[304:14.03]Ladies and gentlemen, we're putting the diamond on display here.
[304:17.77]How do I give it to him?
[304:28.61]What do I do?
[304:32.87]I'm holding a precious stone.
[304:33.93]How do I give this to him?
[304:36.83]Donate to museum.
[304:55.82]Did it Where's my money?
[305:01.94]Where's my bonus gold?
[305:04.42]Where's my bonus gold everybody?
[305:05.77]Where's my bonus that I was promised?
[305:10.69]I didn't get shit.
[305:11.53]I didn't get anything for that.
[305:13.47]I got nothing
[305:16.81]I didn't get anything.
[305:20.53]He didn't give me anything.
[305:21.23]I didn't get any money.
[305:22.13]I didn't get any gold.
[305:22.83]I didn't get any recipes.
[305:25.53]I just put it on a shelf.
[305:26.41]Oh, you fucking snake.
[305:38.46]Why did I do it again?
[305:40.74]Why did I do that again?
[305:41.86]There was no reason to do that.
[305:43.08]Why did I do that again?
[305:43.70]It doesn't do anything to you.
[305:49.75]Fucking God give it back.
[305:52.25]I'm deleting my safe.
[305:53.27]I'm deleting the new save point But now you can look at it anytime you want yeah, I can't touch it though.
[306:06.17]It's technically mine.
[306:07.11]I should be able to take it back oh
[306:14.06]Sell that shit.
[306:15.20]Donate.
[306:15.58]Well, I was under the impression that when you donated, he was like, Wow, what a big rare find.
[306:19.53]Here's $25,000.
[306:21.25]No.
[306:29.44]Is this... Is this motherfucker for real right now?
[306:34.60]This guy for real?
[306:35.36]No.
[306:37.81]Doesn't seem like you have anything to donate to the museum.
[306:40.74]Better get out there and do some treasure hunting, huh?
[306:43.12]Look at this condescending asshole.
[306:45.06]I just gave him a diamond.
[306:53.09]Unbelievable.
[306:57.81]Everybody in this town hates me.
[307:01.88]Literally nobody likes me.
[307:05.24]I walked in with a diamond as big as my head, and that guy still doesn't like me.
[307:12.19]Now I'm just upset.
[307:14.51]Uh... Why do I... I thought I... Nobody even likes me in this town.
[307:25.64]Me and Pam are gonna grow old together.
[307:32.58]Can I buy a better fishing rod?
[307:46.29]Really?
[307:46.59]I am so irritated now.
[307:55.63]Don't worry, I'll find them.
[307:56.43]I'll get another diamond.
[307:58.37]It won't take long.
[308:05.18]Just fucking smash his stuff.
[308:12.30]Cam isn't single.
[308:15.00]Yet.
[308:20.29]She's gonna drop that zero and come to a hero.
[308:28.39]Look, I'm gonna water this plant.
[308:29.59]Oh, look at how nice I'm being.
[308:41.58]Well, I kind of am at a loss right now, so we're just gonna...
[308:47.15]Make a cherry bomb.
[308:49.25]We'll make a bunch of two cherry- three cherry bombs.
[308:54.43]Wait a second.
[308:55.73]I have an idea.
[308:56.17]It's just crazy enough to work.
[309:05.25]It's crazy enough to work.
[309:15.99]Check this.
[309:23.63]We're gonna get rid of that rock in my front lawn.
[309:31.49]Oh, you need a better pickaxe to get rid of this rock.
[309:36.48]Oh, do I?
[309:39.48]Let me introduce you to a good friend of mine.
[309:45.84]The cherry bomb.
[310:07.61]These things are never gonna fucking grow anyways, and you know it.
[310:11.23]See?
[310:13.20]Get rid of them.
[310:14.62]I want new plants here.
[310:36.87]What was I doing?
[310:37.48]Water these fucking plants.
[310:40.54]They're already watered.
[310:41.32]I don't even... I need to sell these.
[311:01.94]What else can I do here?
[311:02.84]Let's go to the blacksmith and...
[311:06.81]Let's just, you know what?
[311:08.03]Here.
[311:09.00]I know what I'm going to do with these.
[311:14.66]Delete the last save.
[311:15.98]Those things weren't growing.
[311:19.52]Am I crazy?
[311:20.94]Or seriously, did I plant those in real time, in real life, like three fucking hours ago?
[311:27.41]Am I crazy?
[311:28.73]Tell me I am.
[311:30.59]Tell me I'm crazy.
[311:33.51]Tell me.
[311:36.24]I would believe you.
[311:49.02]You're crazy.
[312:02.12]That's a double whammy.
[312:02.97]That's a double whammy.
[312:23.24]How long do I have?
[312:24.00]Two days?
[312:24.36]I'm just gonna fucking start smashing shit in my house where the TV color is.
[312:36.05]Yeah, fuck this.
[312:38.17]This TV is going to the front lawn.
[312:40.37]Where it belongs.
[312:43.53]I'm just gonna give this fucking TV to someone.
[312:45.64]I'm just gonna put this TV in somebody's house.
[312:56.11]Who wants an old tube TV?
[313:04.94]I'm just gonna put it in the bar.
[313:12.84]Come on, let me put a TV back here.
[313:14.54]What can I say?
[313:19.72]Can I give the TV to Grandpa?
[313:25.98]Give the TV to the museum.
[313:32.68]He's gonna be like, get out of here.
[313:35.86]I'm gonna bring it to the museum.
[313:40.97]Where's the museum?
[313:45.87]There it is.
[313:48.99]Hold on, wait, I think it's too late.
[313:50.33]When is it closed?
[313:50.89]6 p.m., it's closed.
[314:01.95]A lot of fucking rampage.
[314:09.99]It's like putting dog shit and lighting it on fire in somebody's doorstep.
[314:21.22]Alright.
[314:22.58]Back to square one.
[314:26.31]I'm okay.
[314:26.71]I got three bars now.
[314:27.69]Don't worry.
[314:29.75]Everyone should just chill out.
[314:31.62]I can still do this.
[314:33.70]Just gotta go to the mine.
[314:34.66]No more cherry bombs.
[314:45.43]Just get me out of here.
[314:49.23]Insanity is gone.
[314:57.73]What a joke that last couple of minutes just was.
[314:59.99]What a joke!
[315:02.19]I was on the right path.
[315:03.09]Yeah, I don't want any memory of this.
[315:08.44]I don't want any memory of this.
[315:09.60]I'm moving the next bit of crops down here.
[315:13.36]I don't want to even think about this stupid fucking alien egg.
[315:18.06]So we're gonna go down here.
[315:22.86]Just nice six.
[315:24.10]Nice and easy.
[315:26.18]We'll do eight.
[315:27.54]Right here.
[315:29.53]Right here.
[315:32.31]Okay.
[315:35.09]Okay.
[315:40.08]It all started with the diamond.
[315:41.96]I blame donating the diamond.
[315:43.16]That put me on a path of destruction.
[315:57.92]I still have a day to get 20 copper, and that's exactly what we're going to do.
[316:01.22]We're going to salvage this, don't worry.
[316:11.61]These are almost done.
[316:13.29]I can tell.
[316:15.11]Once they get the sideshow Bob hair, that means they're almost done.
[316:20.75]Why do I still have the fucking TV in my backpack?
[316:25.05]I can't even give the TV to Grandpa, either.
[316:32.29]Alright, I need to store a lot of shit.
[316:36.93]Get rid of the fishing pole, the bait, the cherry bomb.
[316:39.23]Actually, keep the cherry bomb.
[316:41.67]Copper bar, the watering can, the side, the food, the coal, the stone.
[316:49.68]Okay.
[316:51.18]I'm ready to go get copper.
[316:54.32]I am ready.
[316:58.96]What happened to my pancakes?
[317:03.21]I still have.
[317:03.81]Yeah.
[317:04.29]Okay.
[317:05.23]These pancakes are more than a week old at this point.
[317:10.31]Back to the mine.
[317:13.12]I still have all of today.
[317:14.62]It's only 7 o'clock in the morning.
[317:20.44]Let's do this.
[317:21.93]Okay.
[317:22.57]Where is Clint?
[317:24.13]I see he's the blacksmith, right?
[317:25.33]9 a.m.
[317:26.13]to 4 p.m.
[317:26.71]I have until 4 p.m.
[317:30.63]I gotta hightail my ass to the mine right now.
[317:39.72]Quickest route.
[317:41.04]Quickest route.
[317:45.38]Can I get some moons in the chat?
[317:49.67]I guess if you want.
[317:55.98]Alright, so realistically, at around 2pm, 3pm, I gotta go to him.
[318:02.96]Hope I can get there in time and get enough of the ore.
[318:05.86]I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[318:12.53]It's gonna be close.
[318:13.69]Let's hope I can get there in time.
[318:20.69]Looking for copper.
[318:21.37]Copper only.
[318:22.13]Copper only.
[318:27.08]I don't care about any of the little slime people.
[318:28.78]Good.
[318:29.02]Hurt me.
[318:29.36]Don't care.
[318:29.72]Oh, fuck off.
[318:48.33]No copper here.
[318:52.15]Come on.
[318:52.67]Where's the way to go down?
[318:57.37]Nice.
[318:57.69]Go.
[318:59.27]Here we go.
[318:59.83]Come on.
[319:01.59]Give me a couple of these in a row.
[319:03.60]Two.
[319:07.72]Five.
[319:15.82]Itch him.
[319:16.26]Scratch him with a fork.
[319:17.02]Okay, I can get out of there easily right there.
[319:23.96]Anymore?
[319:24.28]There we go.
[319:27.16]Almost halfway there.
[319:34.96]Nope.
[319:35.26]Go.
[319:36.54]Down, down, down, down, down.
[319:37.40]Quickly.
[319:37.68]Oh, look at this gold mine.
[319:43.83]Nine.
[319:44.15]There's a way to go down.
[319:51.35]Give me another one.
[319:52.09]There's another one right here.
[319:54.12]I'm gonna make it.
[319:55.64]I'll be good to go.
[319:56.86]So close.
[320:00.74]There's another one right there.
[320:04.38]No fucking around.
[320:07.86]No messing around, please.
[320:11.60]I'm gonna say two more.
[320:13.46]Two more big ores.
[320:14.20]There's only left down here.
[320:27.56]What about this one?
[320:29.00]Go!
[320:33.90]He closes at 4 o'clock, right?
[320:37.19]Three more.
[320:39.93]Three more, then get me out of here.
[320:47.41]Come on.
[320:48.03]I need one more of those little batch of...
[320:58.35]I need two more, please!
[321:10.49]Give me two more!
[321:15.85]I'm so focused right now.
[321:19.17]And I don't even think I'm gonna get it.
[321:31.13]Gotta be shitting me.
[321:40.56]1pm.
[321:45.56]Dog, you pricks!
[321:52.19]Give me the way down!
[321:53.07]Give me the fucking other one!
[321:58.83]Before this was a waste.
[322:05.78]Change!
[322:06.24]Change the... Change!
[322:11.96]Pancakes.
[322:13.35]Eat them.
[322:18.87]Shit.
[322:20.45]It's over.
[322:21.73]It's definitely over.
[322:25.09]What is this?
[322:25.49]Boots?
[322:27.74]I don't want boots.
[322:28.48]I don't want boots.
[322:31.14]I don't want leather boots.
[322:32.26]I want a...
[322:39.52]Bomb it.
[322:40.52]Bomb it.
[322:44.67]Get me the fuck out of here.
[322:48.63]Get me out of here.
[322:49.07]Get me out of here.
[322:49.51]Get me out.
[322:49.83]Get me out.
[322:56.32]Alright, I need the fastest route possible to right here.
[323:01.18]I think it's down here.
[323:06.41]Wait a second.
[323:06.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[323:07.16]Which one is he?
[323:07.80]Which one is he?
[323:09.24]Is he the blacksmith or is he the adventurer's guild?
[323:11.28]I remember one of the guys has a fucking mustache.
[323:12.94]That's all I remember.
[323:20.51]That's all I remember.
[323:22.83]Go.
[323:27.73]Wait, where am I?
[323:28.19]Where am I?
[323:34.54]Can I put these boots on?
[323:36.06]I don't think they do anything.
[323:45.72]Fuck!
[323:46.88]It's gonna be at the wire!
[323:49.38]Come on!
[323:52.52]I need to go down.
[323:53.38]And then to the right.
[323:57.70]Am I gonna make it?
[323:58.26]Is this a- Please tell me this is like a shortcut. 3.30.
[324:09.49]It's down.
[324:12.43]Oh, God!
[324:15.11]Get me in this!
[324:15.93]Get me in!
[324:19.39]I did it.
[324:19.69]Huh?
[324:27.32]What's going on?
[324:30.92]That's Clint.
[324:31.32]This is Clint, right?
[324:33.09]Is this Clint?
[324:39.90]Right at the wire.
[324:43.94]Yes!
[324:44.60]I got him back.
[324:45.90]And I got money.
[324:47.73]Boink.
[324:53.17]Okay.
[324:53.49]What can I do you for?
[324:54.35]I have three gold bars?
[325:03.45]Or copper bars?
[325:07.84]I'm almost there.
[325:10.33]I'm very close.
[325:11.69]I'll have the five bars.
[325:12.77]I just need the 2,000 gold.
[325:14.77]I can probably get that tomorrow.
[325:17.71]Does he sell anything else?
[325:21.17]He sells iron ore.
[325:22.51]Coal, gold ore.
[325:23.25]You sell weird things, man.
[325:27.31]Two Earth crystals.
[325:29.63]Coal.
[325:33.45]Technically, I could give him two of these.
[325:34.91]Yeah, why not?
[325:36.55]Who gives a crap?
[325:38.94]Closer to my goal of 2,000.
[325:39.82]Oh.
[325:50.59]Donate the boots?
[325:55.93]Are they just on right now?
[325:57.41]Or do I have to equip these?
[325:58.55]Oh, I have to equip them.
[326:02.26]So that's plus one immunity plus one defense.
[326:04.96]Sure.
[326:07.28]Thanks.
[326:11.67]Donated all?
[326:15.13]Oh, process the Geodudes.
[326:16.73]Process the Geodudes.
[326:18.24]It's closed.
[326:20.30]It's closed.
[326:22.34]He's closed.
[326:25.76]Oh my god.
[326:26.60]I was too busy being caught up in all that dumb shit.
[326:29.56]I'll do it tomorrow.
[326:30.37]Don't worry.
[326:30.81]Hopefully I can make enough money where I can upgrade this tool and get this stupid rock off my land.
[326:42.90]Get it off my land.
[326:50.02]Three sunfish.
[326:52.14]90 gold.
[326:53.28]No thanks.
[326:55.30]That's nothing.
[327:00.18]No, I don't want to buy any seeds.
[327:05.65]Let's make it early to bed, early to rise.
[327:10.65]Struggling to make ends meet.
[327:15.03]There's nothing I can really give you.
[327:16.33]Sorry.
[327:18.99]R.I.P.
[327:19.31]Dog the dog is fine.
[327:22.95]He was sleeping.
[327:32.78]See, I'll show you.
[327:33.38]He's going to be fine.
[327:34.82]There he is.
[327:35.16]He's fine.
[327:36.28]See?
[327:38.97]I'll go get him some water and then I'm going to bed.
[327:49.31]There you go.
[327:51.81]I didn't forget about you.
[327:55.53]Drink up.
[327:58.35]By sleeping, you mean dead.
[327:59.73]He's fucking fine.
[328:01.74]Look, he's up there being a dog.
[328:03.14]See, he's shaking.
[328:06.04]Let's see, he was like... Okay, time to sell a bunch of stuff.
[328:13.98]Oh, I got a lot of these Geodudes.
[328:16.68]Sell, sell...
[328:19.77]Sell the rusty sword.
[328:20.83]I don't care about that.
[328:29.81]Okay, we're selling a bunch of stuff.
[328:32.15]I have three of these, right?
[328:37.41]I need two more.
[328:45.52]Any second now.
[328:48.46]any second now.
[328:56.38]Shit.
[328:56.80]I need a coal.
[329:00.97]Ah, shoot.
[329:03.59]Alright.
[329:03.83]Put the bug meat in here.
[329:06.53]Put the monster slime in here.
[329:11.69]Fiber.
[329:14.47]The sword that I'm never going to use because this thing is so much better.
[329:22.46]Can I not?
[329:26.58]I guess I can't.
[329:27.32]Do I have to sell that at a shop or something?
[329:29.40]Because I can't put it in the box.
[329:34.66]Whatever.
[329:38.40]Early to bed, early to rise.
[329:44.93]Level two mining.
[329:45.67]I can make a staircase.
[329:50.42]Plus 5 HP, I can craft a sturdy ring.
[329:52.77]Oh, I got nothing.
[330:01.09]I got nothing for that!
[330:02.01]These are ready!
[330:14.12]These are ready!
[330:16.08]Oh.
[330:16.14]I need to cut them down with the scythe.
[330:23.92]Alright, big takeaway right here.
[330:30.91]Kale.
[330:37.45]Interesting.
[330:40.35]Let's sell the kale.
[330:43.07]Yeah, there's an asteroid in the yard now.
[330:56.54]Are these going to make it through into the summer?
[331:04.20]I hope so.
[331:04.80]To town we go.
[331:18.40]I have five.
[331:20.46]Now I just need two thousand gold.
[331:23.30]And I can get this thing off my wand.
[331:29.78]What happened to the crops near the asteroid?
[331:32.74]Something really bad.
[331:34.58]Something very terrible.
[331:37.20]And I'm not comfortable talking about it.
[331:41.10]Unfortunately.
[331:47.06]Come on, let me get like 2,000.
[331:52.09]Flower dance?
[331:57.61]No, we're not doing that again right now.
[331:59.19]I want to get this thing off my property.
[332:07.19]Yeah, I may or may not have set off a bomb next to them, trying to get rid of the asteroid, and I got rid of all my crops.
[332:15.12]Yeah.
[332:17.18]Unfortunately.
[332:22.12]Yet again, we are staring into the shop's window.
[332:26.79]Yeah, and I got the Geodudes to do as well.
[332:36.20]Is this guy doing the same thing?
[332:37.34]Wait, no, that was the owner?
[332:44.07]Wait, who?
[332:46.39]This guy was so confused.
[332:50.17]He was just like, what is this person doing?
[332:55.84]Ooh, that's a lot.
[332:57.48]$9.90.
[332:58.92]I will definitely sell them.
[333:02.50]So close to $2,000.
[333:03.09]Well, I can sell a little bit of ore.
[333:06.97]Yeah, I'm going to have to go stag to the flower dance.
[333:13.61]You know, I haven't heard that terminology in a long time.
[333:19.08]Going stag.
[333:19.94]What does that even mean?
[333:22.32]I know it means alone, but stag?
[333:26.14]Oh, we're gonna go down here.
[333:33.25]Yeah, nine kale worth more than a diamond.
[333:36.25]Bullshit.
[333:43.07]Alright, guys.
[333:43.85]It's time to upgrade the pickaxe.
[333:50.43]I fucking just sold all of them.
[334:01.15]What?
[334:01.69]I was trying to sell them individually.
[334:03.23]Did I not right click?
[334:06.61]And it wasn't even worth... It wasn't even worth a hundred?
[334:11.57]Not even worth 100 for like 20 fucking ore?
[334:15.94]And you sell them for 50 a piece?
[334:17.52]Fucking open up my Geodudes.
[334:27.26]Yeah, crack it open.
[334:31.92]Dwarvish Helm.
[334:36.43]Oh, yeah.
[334:37.09]The curator will want to know about that.
[334:39.05]What a waste.
[334:45.45]Oh, what's that?
[334:48.64]A ring?
[334:50.12]Thunder Egg.
[334:50.74]Oh, what the hell is that?
[334:58.32]It's green, son.
[334:59.93]Jamborite?
[335:02.84]Alright, I'm slowly making them back.
[335:06.67]A book?
[335:07.29]An old book?
[335:08.71]Granite?
[335:11.27]And coal.
[335:14.07]Okay.
[335:15.43]Well.
[335:17.51]150 for a jamborite.
[335:22.40]Interesting.
[335:26.68]I kind of just want to sell these things.
[335:29.74]Yeah.
[335:30.84]Yeah.
[335:33.41]Yeah.
[335:34.37]Okay.
[335:35.58]Give me... Upgrade my tool.
[335:41.12]Copper watering can or copper pickaxe.
[335:43.42]Used to water crops that can be refilled at any water source.
[335:47.24]Don't I already have a watering can?
[335:50.67]Used to break stones, copper... No, we came here for this.
[335:53.11]This is what we're going to do.
[335:57.79]Oh, fuck.
[335:58.21]I have to wait a couple days?
[335:59.09]Are you serious?
[336:05.48]I belonged in a museum.
[336:07.30]Oh, I got a helmet, didn't I?
[336:08.36]A dwarvish helmet.
[336:12.15]Well, it looks like I know where I'm going.
[336:13.57]I guess I'm going to the museum again.
[336:16.69]I feel like there's something else I should be doing while I'm down here.
[336:30.70]Time to fish.
[336:35.39]That belongs in a museum.
[336:41.07]Well, guess I'm already done.
[336:48.66]No, no, no.
[336:52.18]Hold on a minute.
[336:53.76]I want to talk to him.
[337:00.21]I said he'd be really interested in this.
[337:04.23]Do I have to donate it?
[337:06.23]For him to be interested?
[337:07.15]Well, fine.
[337:10.22]Here.
[337:11.14]Tell me about it.
[337:13.26]What the f- Come on, dude!
[337:19.29]Do you have to be so silent about everything?
[337:34.98]He walled himself in with books.
[337:36.48]He knows you're gonna try to talk to him.
[337:37.94]So what?
[337:38.20]I don't get it.
[337:38.62]Dwarvish helmets.
[337:40.56]One of the helmets commonly worn by dwarves.
[337:43.47]Okay.
[337:43.89]The thick metal plating protects them from falling to reason.
[337:48.37]I could have told you that without needing to donate this.
[337:54.84]Hey, you want to bring that dwarvish helm to the curator.
[337:58.49]He might have more information.
[338:01.35]The dwarvish helm was worn by dwarves, and it was put on their head to protect from stuff that was going to hit them in the head.
[338:09.35]Good.
[338:10.83]Good knowledge.
[338:15.57]Thanks, Gunther.
[338:18.25]Hmm?
[338:26.13]No, I'm taking my egg and we're getting out of here.
[338:27.83]Alright, what's next?
[338:31.81]What's on the list?
[338:32.43]Uh, enter the Adventurer's Guild, go deeper in the mines, get an animal ore.
[338:41.94]There's one person I haven't talked to.
[338:43.37]Who is it?
[338:45.83]Who's the one talents person I haven't spoken to?
[338:53.28]I have no idea who that is.
[338:55.12]Who I have not talked to.
[339:03.49]Well.
[339:05.47]I think this is a stopping point.
[339:08.45]It's been like six hours now.
[339:11.60]Something crazy like that.
[339:13.32]Are you the last person I haven't talked to?
[339:17.06]Shit.
[339:22.41]Check your Facebook and find out who you didn't talk to.
[339:27.91]Let's get to like a stopping point.
[339:34.22]I've already spoke to this guy.
[339:42.60]Oh yeah, you can go to the heart page.

[339:58.28]Where is this lady?
[339:59.20]Could be looking for the blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl.
[340:06.73]Wherever she may be.
[340:12.73]I don't think she lives here.
[340:13.47]What about in here?
[340:23.96]Nope.
[340:30.15]Check your social links.
[340:35.93]Town Square.
[340:41.29]Lonely Stone.

[342:05.34]Well, maybe I'll do that too.
[342:11.77]First, I want to see what's up in this area because I haven't seen it.

[348:10.05]Everyone's saying cooking stream?
[348:12.05]I don't have the capabilities to do that.
[348:18.43]I don't have a webcam in my kitchen.
[348:19.89]When does the museum open?
[348:26.72]Almost time.
[348:35.39]Please no cooking.
[348:36.23]I'm not going to do a cooking stream.
[348:39.76]I physically can't do that.
[348:42.06]Oh my god, my game is about to crash.

[349:33.03]I can't even physically do that.
[349:39.45]Use your CPU heatsink.
[349:40.55]I don't think that would go so well.
[349:42.55]Alright, you got my shit?
[349:47.83]Still working on your pickaxe.
[349:48.95]It won't be ready today.

[350:19.16]I might.
[350:20.38]Depends.
[350:20.92]I might finish Layers of Fear or maybe I'll play this or Overwatch or something.
[350:23.90]I don't know.
[350:25.36]Or I might stream in a couple days.
[350:26.46]You'll see me soon.
[350:27.76]So, much love.
[350:30.20]Thanks again to all the new subs and all the old subs and all the viewers, everybody.
[350:34.20]Take care.
[350:34.60]Have a good evening.
[350:37.46]And bye-bye.
