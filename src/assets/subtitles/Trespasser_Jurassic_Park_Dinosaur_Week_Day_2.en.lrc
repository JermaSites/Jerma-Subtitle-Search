[00:36.04]Hey!
[00:37.46]Hey everybody.
[00:40.58]Little early today by about ten minutes.
[00:43.78]Sometimes you're early though.
[00:46.62]Most of the time you're late.
[00:48.36]Sometimes you're early.
[00:51.66]Gonna have to have an early.
[00:54.16]Like a hashtag early.
[00:56.61]Exclamation point early.
[00:57.69]I'm not gonna see it very often so it better be something cool.
[01:05.27]Tonight.
[01:07.07]As you could probably imagine.
[01:09.18]Tonight we're going to be doing more dinosaur stuff.
[01:13.84]I tested everything.
[01:17.00]Shit fucking works.
[01:19.55]I spent like 72 days making sure this works.
[01:23.70]Because this one was the one that didn't work last time.
[01:26.02]And I think it's the most important one.
[01:28.90]Because this game looks like it's going to be very fun.
[01:32.06]The game we're going to start with, the game we're going to play for the most part, but mostly for tonight, is a game called Trespasser.
[01:38.34]Jurassic Park Trespasser.
[01:43.80]Looks very interesting.
[01:46.34]Who knows if it's going to be any good, but that's kind of the risk we take on these streams.
[01:53.22]Actually checking beforehand.
[01:54.40]I actually checked last time.
[01:55.52]But I had to download like a mod to make this work.
[01:59.10]I had to do all kinds of like... You know what I mean?
[02:04.85]Is the snake still on the wall?
[02:05.71]Yes.
[02:07.63]The snake is still on the wall.
[02:08.97]I have not found it yet.
[02:11.23]So, I'm just waiting for people to trickle in.
[02:13.69]I just made a tweet.
[02:14.91]Thank you, fellow beer.
[02:15.71]For your subscription.
[02:21.91]Is this a Game Socks?
[02:22.75]I don't think so.
[02:24.10]I think this one's actually going to be fun to play.
[02:26.44]This one's going to be interesting, I think.
[02:27.88]I hope.
[02:28.30]Who knows?
[02:30.64]Alright.
[02:31.54]I'll be right back in about two minutes.
[02:33.44]Get yourself comfortable.
[02:34.58]We begin shortly.
[03:21.71]Okay, let's get this going.
[03:23.75]Turn this off.
[03:25.15]Move this over here.
[03:27.55]Here comes a loud noise.
[03:29.11]We're doing loud noises tonight, so here we go.
[03:33.42]Welcome to Trespasser.
[03:36.26]Trespasser.
[03:37.28]My name is John Parker Hammond.
[03:39.82]I was born on March 14th...
[03:44.92]I was about to scream.
[03:45.72]I was about to fucking scream because I thought it crashed.
[03:47.69]There we go.
[04:09.71]The dinosaurs.
[04:10.17]There it is.
[04:10.49]There's the gross candy that you can buy.
[04:12.13]Oh, and there's like a gross egg you can buy too.
[04:31.65]You know those candies with bugs in them that are in like the sugary, salty amber?
[04:35.35]That's what that was.
[04:36.47]But it was not all so easy or so simple as it appeared.
[04:41.19]And seldom hears the true history of such events.
[04:44.88]What happened at the place where the world changed?
[04:47.80]In Gen Files Chapter 11, we're bankrupt.
[04:50.46]What were the reasons?
[04:52.68]What was the cost?
[05:06.05]DreamWorks Interactive presents... A tell-tale game.
[05:11.86]Lord Richard Attenborough and Minnie Driver.
[05:17.58]Trespasser.
[05:21.91]Dog's tail.
[05:26.01]That was kind of... Alright, well that was... Here we go.
[05:29.73]I already did the settings.
[05:30.77]We're all good.
[05:32.32]New game.
[05:34.30]Don't need to spend any time doing this shit.
[05:35.78]I was prepared today.
[05:36.62]This is my laundry list.
[05:38.82]This is my grocery list.
[05:42.06]This is all my bills I haven't paid.
[05:45.69]Your watch is going to come in and be like, I was a detective.
[05:48.27]It's me.
[05:48.75]Here's my story.
[05:50.21]This is the movies.
[05:52.71]You're probably wondering how I got here.
[05:57.95]This is just that movie.
[06:00.30]Hey, Walter P. Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[06:06.52]I can't see what you said, though.
[06:07.86]I will in a minute.
[06:10.74]That's my manager.
[06:14.63]What?
[06:14.87]Somebody's puking?
[06:15.71]What the fuck is going on?
[06:17.53]Somebody just puked in that bathroom and now we're crashing!
[06:23.48]What the fuck was that?
[06:43.21]Huh?
[06:44.89]Huh?
[06:45.67]Huh?
[06:47.73]Alright, apparently, apparently, here we are.
[06:52.57]There's the, there's the plane.
[06:56.33]That is a small plane.
[06:59.85]Was I riding on top of this plane?
[07:03.21]That's a giant person.
[07:05.73]Wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, there's the door.
[07:08.53]There's the random, like, old-timey wooden fucking door.
[07:11.41]What?
[07:14.36]Alright, that's how you look around.
[07:17.68]Nice plane.
[07:18.26]Alright, your adventure begins here.
[07:20.98]Where the fuck is going all of my hand?
[07:31.03]Alright.
[07:32.09]Apparently you can just like put your hand down.
[07:33.73]We're gonna go this way.
[07:39.36]look down for oh oh oh you got me press q to press q to jump no we're not I'm not I'm changing that the second I'm able to q to jump can I like pet the rock why do I feel like I'm four feet tall
[08:03.47]Okay.
[08:04.07]Press A and D to step left and right.
[08:05.94]Sure.
[08:06.94]Like every other video game that ever existed.
[08:09.98]Press Z to crouch.
[08:12.74]No, dude.
[08:13.54]Z is crouch and Q is jump.
[08:15.90]We're changing that.
[08:17.03]In fact, we're changing it right now.
[08:18.11]Let me just get shot with a gun first.
[08:20.73]Hold on.
[08:22.37]Sidestep, jump, space, crouch, C, rotate, arm.
[08:28.00]What do you mean rotate, arm?
[08:33.49]I guess we'll keep that again.
[08:34.47]Throw.
[08:34.89]I mean, F is fine.
[08:37.47]Use and fire.
[08:40.25]E?
[08:42.73]Rotate wrist?
[08:46.51]Wait a minute.
[08:47.25]Is this like Surgeon Simulator?
[08:49.27]What the fuck are they talking about?
[08:52.05]Move, hand, grab, drop.
[08:53.39]What is this game?
[08:54.35]I thought this was like a Jurassic Park game.
[08:57.79]Stow and retrieve is going to be like F. Throw is going to be G. Okay, hold on.
[09:05.26]Are you serious?
[09:12.60]Are you trying to tell me that I'm gonna have to do some fucking weird surgeon simulator shit with this?
[09:18.71]What was the other one?
[09:19.29]I'm just walking with a broken arm.
[09:26.35]Okay.
[09:27.79]How do I get this off?
[09:30.10]There we go.
[09:30.70]You can use your hand to move and carry objects.
[09:32.54]Okay.
[09:34.14]Can I pick this?
[09:35.58]Pressing holding the left mouse button.
[09:38.06]Oh god, somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[09:39.49]Hold on.
[09:41.25]Hold on.
[09:41.69]Oh god!
[09:43.61]There we go, now I can see.
[09:46.49]Okay, now I can actually see.
[09:50.09]Oh, we're good.
[09:51.51]Sir Jimmy, thank you Sir Jimmy Jammer for the 50 bucks.
[09:53.98]I thought I had my quality on high, not 480p.
[09:57.24]Oh, this is an old shitty game.
[09:59.59]So, your graphics are fine, I assure you.
[10:02.03]But thank you so much, Sir Jimmy.
[10:04.19]You're one of those... You're one of those high contributors.
[10:07.51]Thank you so much, man.
[10:08.89]And then SticksRenegade gave 20 bucks.
[10:10.87]German, what's your favorite dino?
[10:13.85]What's the weird dinosaur that's in the water?
[10:15.45]It's like a Loch Ness Monster?
[10:17.41]You know, like the Loch Ness Monster dinosaur?
[10:19.31]Whatever it is.
[10:19.85]I don't know what it is.
[10:20.34]It's called like a... It's called like a telepio, like telepathicio, whatever.
[10:24.10]I don't even know what the fucking thing's called.
[10:25.78]But thank you, Sticks.
[10:26.66]And Walter!
[10:27.54]Thank you, Walter P.,
[10:29.32]Uh, it says, I thought Dr. Ochre was a germa joke until I saw it in the store today.
[10:32.96]I bought it and it was quite good.
[10:35.22]Yeah, it was quite good.
[10:36.04]Alright, let's pick this up.
[10:40.80]Oh, yeah, good job.
[10:41.84]I can just, like, drag this shit around.
[10:45.28]Hey, guys, welcome to Jurassic Park.
[10:51.23]Come here.
[10:51.69]Get... This, honestly, is just, like, Octodad.
[10:58.48]You guys want to play Octodad?
[10:59.36]Because that's what we're doing.
[11:06.65]That is so dumb.
[11:09.35]Pick up the 2x4.
[11:13.15]Good.
[11:13.41]Hold the left mouse button and move the mouse to wield it.
[11:16.71]Are you shitting me?
[11:18.97]Oh my god, this is incredible.
[11:21.00]Please tell me I can bash somebody's fucking skull in with this.
[11:23.94]This is the best game ever made.
[11:25.48]Who hates this game?
[11:26.62]How dare you hate this game?
[11:33.48]I thought this was going to be... Oh, this is going to be fantastic.
[11:36.17]I can already tell.
[11:38.91]Good.
[11:39.11]Try picking up some other items.
[11:41.25]Where is it?
[11:41.67]Is it like in my body?
[11:42.63]I'm going to crouch.
[11:46.59]Get the paint can.
[11:49.93]Can I just like whip this?
[11:56.87]What?
[11:57.13]Oh, I'm storing items.
[12:07.30]I'm not sure what that's doing, but whatever.
[12:08.99]Yeah.
[12:15.97]Okay, let's just keep walking because this thing's like kind of fucked up in my hand right now.
[12:21.91]Dude, imagine like a Hitman game like this and there's a guy right there like next to the wall.
[12:25.92]And I just fucking mash his head in.
[12:31.62]Oh, you can throw shit too.
[12:32.62]This is fantastic.
[12:36.25]Oh my god.
[12:38.61]Yeah.
[12:40.03]I think we found the best game of the week so far.
[12:43.17]Sure thing.
[12:43.77]Okay, where do we go?
[12:45.58]Just keep going up?
[12:47.16]I guess.
[12:51.98]What does this remind me of?
[12:52.96]Was I supposed to do something else over here?
[13:00.22]I love how my hand goes inside of itself.
[13:01.72]Well, we don't even need that shit, but maybe I have to do something else here.
[13:04.38]Look down.
[13:05.33]I know, I know.
[13:06.21]Yes, I know.
[13:08.71]I know.
[13:09.03]This is a female character.
[13:10.95]I know.
[13:11.63]I get it.
[13:14.29]Feel free to practice running and jumping.
[13:15.85]Okay, I'm ready to move on.
[13:20.95]Why do I feel like I'm not running, by the way?
[13:24.94]This side up.
[13:30.86]Okay, that's a broken, that is a broken fucking hand.
[13:34.47]That shit just, I just got destroyed.
[13:36.17]That broke my fucking whole hand.
[13:38.29]That crushed me.
[13:40.27]I need to go to the hospital after that one.
[13:42.80]How much did Minnie Driver make for this movie?
[13:58.62]I can't, I'm stuck out of this.
[14:02.29]Am I taking the door with me?
[14:04.31]How strong is mini driver by the way?
[14:07.75]This is like not something a person can do.
[14:09.65]Can I throw the door?
[14:15.38]No fucking way.
[14:17.34]That's perfect.
[14:20.18]Hey, how about this?
[14:23.20]Shit.
[14:23.34]All right, firearms.
[14:25.07]What is this, where are there firearms?
[14:30.75]This is so sloppy.
[14:31.79]All right, here we go.
[14:32.49]There's a gun right here.
[14:36.27]Dude, do I have to hold?
[14:37.11]Look at this wrist.
[14:39.43]You can aim the gun using the sights.
[14:42.11]Dude, don't.
[14:44.15]You have to do that?
[14:47.75]How the fuck am I supposed to use this?
[14:51.59]Does anybody have any idea how I'm supposed to use this gun?
[14:55.83]How do you fire the gun?
[15:03.49]So that's what that feels like.
[15:09.43]This is going to be fucking so good.
[15:11.05]I can't even wait.
[15:12.25]Wow, whoops, dropped it.
[15:15.27]Give me back.
[15:16.03]Where am I?
[15:16.81]I'm stuck in the fucking crate.
[15:20.39]Six left.
[15:23.67]Six left.
[15:24.81]Six left.
[15:28.68]I love this game already.
[15:29.74]This game is perfect.
[15:32.02]No, pick the fucking gunner.
[15:35.78]Oh my god, I love it.
[15:37.20]I love this game.
[15:37.94]We're not done.
[15:39.40]We're not gonna stop playing this game for a while, guys.
[15:41.42]I hope you understand this.
[15:44.83]Like, do you guys fucking understand that this shit, we're gonna play this for a long time?
[15:51.03]It's a fucking baseball bat, too.
[15:52.59]Where's the gun?
[15:58.23]How did I... Six rounds.
[16:00.89]Six left.
[16:02.55]Jesus Christ!
[16:04.49]I dropped it and the gun fired.
[16:05.85]Five rounds left.
[16:07.53]God damn it.
[16:10.17]Please pick up the fucking gun.
[16:11.63]Pick the gun up.
[16:12.56]Pick it up and keep it in your fucking hand.
[16:15.02]Get it!
[16:16.18]Get the gun.
[16:20.12]I'm like stuck in the door.
[16:21.96]My arm is bent the wrong way.
[16:23.86]Okay, use your superhuman strength and get this fucking thing out of here.
[16:28.44]Open the door, please.
[16:29.58]Open it.
[16:30.68]Open it.
[16:33.32]Okay, get it.
[16:35.32]Get the gun.
[16:36.58]Three shots.
[16:37.46]Yeah, three shots.
[16:38.72]Good.
[16:40.18]You, like, drunk bitch.
[16:42.59]To strike with an object, pick up the object and press the space bar.
[16:46.91]Oh, God, that's not the right.
[16:48.13]That's not even...
[16:58.80]And then space is jump.
[16:59.86]Q... Hold on.
[17:01.45]What is... Let me look at the controls for a second.
[17:06.77]This is ridiculous.
[17:08.45]Rotate wrist is shift.
[17:10.15]Throw E. F is stow and retrieve.
[17:14.55]Okay.
[17:17.01]Control is rotate.
[17:18.09]Shift is rotate.
[17:19.02]E is use.
[17:23.19]And F is store.
[17:24.35]Okay.
[17:26.93]So that means like I... There.
[17:29.10]So E... This apparently is swinging the bat.
[17:35.00]G is throw.
[17:35.94]Store.
[17:36.40]I'm going to store that.
[17:37.48]Now where's the gun?
[17:39.55]Okay.
[17:40.27]Now this too.
[17:42.83]Store this.
[17:45.29]Alright.
[17:45.71]So now I got the bat.
[17:47.81]That's how you use that.
[17:48.59]Cool.
[17:53.14]This is good.
[17:53.96]We're good.
[17:56.42]Just wait till we get to our first... I dropped the bat.
[17:59.02]The bat got stuck on a tree.
[18:01.98]Do I have like a knife in my body?
[18:03.74]What is in my left side of my chest right there?
[18:08.38]God, you fucking idiot.
[18:10.09]Please pick up the bat.
[18:11.51]Keep it in your hand like this.
[18:17.51]Okay, good.
[18:27.41]This game is perfect.
[18:29.69]Can they remake this game, please?
[18:31.05]I want this game remade.
[18:35.43]Engine.
[18:36.61]Some kind of... Wait.
[18:40.11]International Genetic Technologies.
[18:41.99]Why am I holding it like this?
[18:43.23]That was the company from the dinosaur trial.
[18:45.67]Okay, fine.
[18:46.09]After the trial, that old guy, John Hammond, wrote a book.
[18:49.58]He said it was somewhere in Central America.
[18:52.08]My name is John Parker Hammond.
[18:54.62]I was born on March 14th, 1928.
[18:56.50]Oh, shit.
[18:58.34]Oh, no.
[19:00.40]Oh, God.
[19:01.78]If this works, I swear to God.
[19:03.03]This is Site B. If this works.
[19:04.71]This is John Hammond's lost world.
[19:16.89]It didn't work.
[19:17.77]It didn't work.
[19:24.09]I gotta switch it.
[19:27.20]I gotta switch it like this.
[19:28.90]Okay, that's better.
[19:32.58]I already... Oh, this game.
[19:34.26]Oh, shit.
[19:34.58]I hear a dinosaur.
[19:38.05]I hear a dinosaur.
[19:40.89]Don't worry, guys.
[19:41.75]We have a baseball bat still.
[19:48.36]Oh, damn it!
[19:49.66]I was trying to... Well, that gun's fucking... The gun's empty.
[19:53.47]Great.
[19:55.55]At least I can swing with it.
[19:56.65]Fuck!
[19:57.71]I was trying to do... That's what I was trying to do.
[19:59.57]I was trying to go like this, and it shot the gun.
[20:01.45]Fuck this.
[20:02.79]Let's go.
[20:02.97]Right here.
[20:18.02]I hear loud noises, by the way.
[20:20.93]Am I about to fight a dinosaur with a baseball bat?
[20:24.47]I don't remember this being in the movie.
[20:28.83]Yes, I have an idea.
[20:30.41]I'm going to go after the giant dinosaur with a shitty wooden t-ball bat.
[20:35.32]That sounds like a plan.
[20:37.48]Holy fuck.
[20:38.88]Wow.
[20:39.06]Wow.
[20:41.46]Wow.
[20:45.63]That's so cool.
[20:46.43]Let me go.
[20:46.77]I want to go look.
[20:48.07]Wait.
[20:50.47]I don't want to do that.
[20:51.31]Oh, that shit again.
[20:53.09]Thank God.
[20:53.66]I fucking just thought to do that.
[20:55.44]Okay.
[20:56.46]Imagine if I didn't do that.
[20:57.36]Oh, the Brachiosaur.
[21:15.86]I got it.
[21:17.34]It's stuck in its loop.
[21:18.88]Can I have that back?
[21:29.06]I need that back!

[22:56.51]Are you trying to... Look at that texture up there.
[23:02.60]Am I not supposed to go this way?
[23:08.26]Alright, hold on.
[23:12.60]What is run?
[23:14.04]I was supposed to look at that.

[23:51.60]Am I going to get more voiceovers?
[23:52.98]I knew all along this was a stupid idea.
[23:55.14]They're probably out drinking right now.
[23:58.36]Okay.
[23:59.90]And?
[24:01.36]And who?
[24:02.06]They're probably out drinking right now.

[24:48.60]I think I'm...
[24:53.48]What is going on?
[25:02.27]What is happening to me?
[25:06.15]He just sits there like he eats.
[25:17.45]What is he taking?
[25:28.63]That scared the fucking shit out of me.
[25:31.57]She's like, yeah, no, she's probably out drinking.
[25:34.23]And then there's like a dinosaur.
[25:37.99]I don't think I'm prepared for this.
[25:44.43]Like, you know what I mean?
[25:45.05]Like, I need a gun.
[25:46.85]Brachiosaur.
[25:48.61]Oldest of our recreations by 50 million years.
[25:55.14]And?
[25:55.96]And who?
[25:56.66]Probably I'll drink it right now.
[25:58.84]Oh, this is great.
[26:01.54]And who?
[26:17.76]He really did it.
[26:19.60]Okay, I need to learn how to actually use this.
[26:22.20]It's E. E is swing.
[26:29.01]But it doesn't do anything.
[26:30.93]Looks like it's made out of rubber.
[26:37.67]Whatever.
[26:38.03]Okay, this time, be prepared.
[26:41.23]of the random dinosaur.
[26:47.62]No, not this again.
[26:49.02]And I drop the fucking bat immediately.
[26:54.00]Pick up the bat, please.
[26:55.22]Pick it up.
[26:56.08]And bring it up here.
[26:57.71]Have it.
[26:58.89]Oh my god.
[27:00.11]Okay.
[27:01.01]I'm ready.
[27:02.45]I'm ready for him.
[27:03.19]Can I have two bats at the same time?
[27:05.23]He comes from back here.
[27:06.07]He just like jump scares you.
[27:11.94]I'm gonna go in the truck.
[27:12.70]I'm, like, safe in the truck, I think.
[27:16.41]Save.
[27:22.03]Let's go.
[27:22.31]Alright, where is he?
[27:24.56]I'm just gonna, like, just mash his head.
[27:33.74]Where is he?
[27:36.11]Use my gun?
[27:36.61]I don't have a gun anymore.
[27:39.61]Where the fuck is this stupid, like, velociraptor?
[27:41.71]There he comes.
[27:45.33]Where is he?
[27:45.73]I don't know.
[27:46.71]Oh my god, I hear him.
[27:52.49]Where is he?
[27:53.71]I'm so scared to go over here.
[27:54.77]There he is.
[27:55.05]Okay.
[27:56.89]Come on.
[27:58.09]Put your face right here, buddy.
[28:00.24]And I'm gonna, I'm going, I don't know, the game just crashed.
[28:02.28]Oh my god, something's going really horribly wrong right now.
[28:06.36]Hold on.
[28:08.52]I'm at like one frame a second.
[28:10.48]What happened?
[28:11.88]What is happening?
[28:12.50]Okay, we're good.
[28:22.05]Get the gun?
[28:22.51]Where's their gun?
[28:23.15]Is there a gun in the car?
[28:25.91]Oh my god, there's a gun right there.
[28:32.09]Okay, here we go.
[28:34.86]Just show yourself.
[28:36.43]Show yourself while I point like a sloppy drunk at you.
[28:39.39]Come here.
[28:40.29]Where is he?
[28:40.57]Alright.
[28:43.81]Here we go.
[28:47.88]Got him!
[28:50.18]Okay, he's dead.
[28:59.26]Store this.
[29:01.98]Go grab it.
[29:03.80]Get that.
[29:04.94]Store it.
[29:08.22]Give it a bat too.
[29:12.80]Harvest the flesh.
[29:16.79]Alright, we're good.
[29:19.97]Something tells me the melee weapons are absolutely useless.
[29:29.86]Melee seems like something I don't want to do.
[29:33.33]Oh, what are you thinking?
[29:36.33]Giving me, like, a Super Mario 64, like, platforming thing.
[29:40.21]Great.
[29:43.37]Oh, my God.
[29:44.69]This movement is so sloppy already, you're gonna put a fucking Mario 64 Bob-omb World thing here?
[29:54.51]Made it.
[29:54.91]Alright, what's in here?
[29:55.95]Another gun.
[29:57.17]Alright, store this.
[29:58.10]Give me this one.
[29:59.34]Empty.
[30:00.82]That's fine.
[30:04.79]Can I only hold two things at once?
[30:07.21]I think I can only hold two things.
[30:09.36]Empty.

[30:39.29]I'm very aware of it.
[30:41.33]Look at this.
[30:41.71]It's just like... Your arm just acts like... It's just so stupid.
[30:47.40]Like, look at... Who would ever use a gun like this?
[30:51.64]I just heard something.
[30:55.50]That sounded like a saber-toothed tiger.
[30:57.52]Eight shots.
[31:01.63]Oh, goddammit.

[31:45.02]There's way more to see here.
[31:50.47]That missed.
[31:52.45]Is he running away?
[32:00.52]Does she have to count down?
[32:01.92]Do you have to count down like that?
[32:03.23]She's like, five, four, three, two.
[32:05.13]No one would count how many shots they had.
[32:18.76]The technology, the real trick of it, is still in there.
[32:21.88]Shit, I'm not going to make this.
[32:23.12]A darkened room in an empty building with an empty floor.
[32:27.39]It waits.
[32:29.03]The flashpoint, the origin of Jurassic Park.
[32:32.17]I got two guns.
[32:36.45]Save.
[32:37.85]Save, save, save, save, save.
[32:43.45]Yes.
[32:45.29]Now, you gotta shoot him in the head.
[32:47.01]Just like every other video game.
[32:48.93]Go for the head.
[32:51.53]They come up behind.
[32:52.11]You hear the noise and he comes to the right.
[32:53.84]He's gonna be behind this rock.
[32:55.56]Line up the shot.
[32:56.22]Where is it?
[32:57.48]Right here, right?
[32:58.18]Yep, there he is.
[32:58.74]Okay, line it up.
[33:08.04]What's wrong?
[33:09.04]What is he doing?
[33:11.64]Is there like limb damage in this game?
[33:13.78]Did I just hit him in the leg?
[33:14.74]Because he's kind of walking like he has a spaghetti up his ass.
[33:22.89]Is he doing that on purpose?
[33:26.55]Oh my god, please shoot him!
[33:33.48]What on earth are you doing?
[33:45.17]He was doing lunges.
[33:46.53]He was doing lunges.
[33:49.14]All I did was I just caught that guy in the middle of an exercise.
[33:52.80]He wasn't even trying to kill me.
[33:54.32]He was just doing lunges.
[33:55.28]Okay, we're good.
[34:02.82]How many shots do I have in this?
[34:05.46]Where?
[34:06.06]Where are you?
[34:07.02]I have another gun, too.
[34:09.08]Where is it?
[34:13.07]Where is he?
[34:13.59]Okay.
[34:16.57]Save.
[34:20.37]This game is fucking awesome.
[34:22.21]Yep.
[34:26.39]Velociraptor.
[34:34.39]We're getting over to the park entrance, I believe.
[34:36.91]I believe this is the park entrance.
[34:39.49]Here it is.
[34:44.57]Site B. Welcome to the research facility.
[34:49.93]Well, make sure no one's going to creep up on me.
[35:00.58]I missed, like, a bunch of bits, too.
[35:02.89]I will get to those bits in a second.
[35:05.71]I need to get to, like, a place where I can stop.
[35:09.03]I gotta feel like there's probably, like, a gun up here or something, right?
[35:12.36]Or... Do I have to, like, press this button?
[35:16.66]Okay, great.
[35:17.86]Well...
[35:20.23]Welcome to Site B, an InGen research facility.
[35:24.05]For centuries, mankind has wondered about the dinosaurs, the largest land animals ever to have lived.
[35:29.79]What's with this guy's voice?
[35:33.33]Am I supposed to do anything with this?
[35:37.91]Is like a train gonna come in here?
[35:43.98]Apparently not.
[35:45.50]Guys, I have another gun.
[35:47.10]Don't worry.
[35:47.42]I have another gun.
[35:48.18]And there's a fucking lead pipe right there.
[35:49.64]Are you kidding me?
[35:50.38]Yeah.
[35:52.40]Give me that.
[35:54.35]You can reach that.
[35:56.11]You can absolutely reach that shit.
[35:57.53]Please just grab it.
[35:58.51]You're right there.
[36:02.81]Well, might as well get the fucking other gun.
[36:05.52]Do I even want this?
[36:07.84]I was going to get one shot.
[36:16.74]Shoot the barrel.
[36:18.80]Why?
[36:19.00]So it can explode and kill me and you can laugh at me?
[36:21.86]I don't think I... Wow.
[36:30.35]Really?
[36:31.53]Wow, that doesn't even do anything.
[36:36.49]I thought we were going to get a funny stream joke right there.
[36:39.29]No, apparently not.
[36:42.62]That's it.
[36:44.77]Oh.
[36:46.37]Fuel, huh?
[36:49.17]I really thought we were gonna get a funny stream joke.
[37:01.16]Sorry, guys.

[37:21.99]I do want to say thank you.
[37:23.23]I don't know why names aren't popping up, but somebody gave 420.
[37:25.23]Somebody gave 200 bits.
[37:27.71]They said, Jerma, I love that new heart tattoo on your left boob.
[37:30.69]Brings out your eyes.
[37:31.56]Well, thank you.
[37:32.48]I don't know why they're not showing the names right now, but Steb, thank you for the $5.
[37:35.80]This is that one TF2 mod that makes your entire body jiggle bones.
[37:41.86]It does kind of look like that.
[37:43.42]Kuzon, thank you for the $5.
[37:44.87]Your health bar is on your left

[38:08.02]I so badly want to shoot myself.
[38:10.30]Like, it might be possible.
[38:11.76]It really might be.
[38:12.36]This game is so stupid.
[38:13.26]Like, it's so broken and shit.
[38:16.30]Let's see.
[38:17.06]There's got to be the right way I can do this while I'm walking, maybe.
[38:21.32]One shot left.
[38:23.06]I have to give this a really good attempt here.
[38:27.62]One shot.
[38:34.20]Alright, let's go.
[38:35.20]One shot.
[38:37.54]Do it?
[38:38.96]It's hard.
[38:39.50]I can't do it.
[38:40.12]She keeps dropping it.
[38:45.05]The only way this is possible is if this can turn here, and that goes up like this.
[38:59.59]One shot left.
[39:00.90]And I... Okay.
[39:02.88]Five rounds left.
[39:04.22]Fuck it.

[39:48.37]Alright, we're going to try.
[39:50.17]Here we go.
[39:50.55]This is the moment of truth, guys.
[39:56.50]I'll get it.
[39:57.44]I'm just trying to figure out how to use this gun.

[41:07.18]Here we go.
[41:11.26]Damn it!
[41:13.04]One shot left.
[41:14.10]That's it.
[41:19.16]This has to happen.
[41:21.45]I'm sorry, guys.
[41:22.53]Welcome to the joke.

[42:02.93]The horse is not beaten yet.
[42:04.01]I don't care.
[42:04.41]We're going to give this two more attempts.
[42:12.60]One shot left.
[42:24.74]One shot.
[42:26.10]God damn it.
[42:27.65]All right, fine.
[42:29.17]It's definitely possible though.
[42:31.71]If this were a YouTube video, I would be here for four hours.
[42:40.12]Here we go.
[42:40.82]This is the spot.
[42:42.06]This is the spot right here.
[42:45.12]That's it.
[42:46.30]What?
[42:47.02]Five shots.
[42:48.56]Damn it!
[42:49.00]That was right in my fucking face.
[42:51.19]That was right in my face.
[42:52.51]You saw that it was curling right in my... That's it.
[42:57.65]Five shots.
[42:58.39]Why am I spending so much time on this?
[43:00.77]Why do I want to do this so bad?
[43:07.20]Five rounds left.
[43:09.73]Alright, it's over.
[43:10.89]Alright, let's go.
[43:11.86]That's it.
[43:12.76]It's over.
[43:15.94]There'll be a better spot.
[43:16.88]You know what?
[43:17.60]Because you know why?
[43:18.12]There's other guns in this game.
[43:19.26]There'll be like a shotgun where I can just turn it and shoot myself.
[43:21.27]Don't worry.
[43:22.97]The joke is not dead.
[43:24.05]I refuse to say.
[43:24.83]Oh, by the way, the level ends here, so who cares?
[43:47.41]Am I dead?
[43:48.03]Or have I just given up?
[43:50.03]Am I dead or is my leg just broken and I don't care?
[43:52.90]That's not that far of a fall.
[43:56.76]I think I just don't care.
[43:57.82]I can still move my head.
[44:13.53]Hey, remember this joke?
[44:18.33]Hey, remember this one?
[44:22.76]Five rounds left.
[44:27.48]One.
[44:28.24]That's it.
[44:31.40]Alright, let's go.
[44:36.13]Tried shooting yourself and ended up just falling to your death.
[44:39.95]I know, like what in the name of God?
[44:45.25]Yeah, here's the new God.
[44:46.05]Let's keep playing the game.
[44:47.13]Let's go.
[44:50.35]Eight shots.
[44:51.17]Eight shots.
[44:51.63]Here's an opportunity.
[44:52.41]Here's another opportunity.
[44:54.49]You guys thought I was done with that shit?
[44:58.23]Eight shots.
[45:00.59]You guys thought it was over.
[45:04.51]Seven shots.
[45:06.71]Four, two, one.
[45:10.47]Alright, now we're really done.
[45:13.75]Let's go.
[45:16.43]I so badly want to just turn this into my face and have me just fall over.
[45:19.48]Alright, enough.
[45:24.46]Enough.
[45:24.72]Enough.
[45:24.96]I get so locked in, guys.
[45:26.14]I can't help it.
[45:34.31]Let's go.
[45:34.71]Alright.
[45:36.13]No more joking around.
[45:37.17]Let's actually move to the next area.
[45:42.97]What do you mean, fix the controls?
[45:43.89]What do you mean?
[45:44.89]Wait, what's wrong with the controls?
[45:48.32]Move backwards, X. Move forward, wait, what?
[45:53.71]What the fuck is going on here?
[45:57.73]Why is move, walk forward and run forward are different?
[46:00.75]I'm gonna make it two.
[46:04.62]Like, what?
[46:06.08]No, this is gonna be dumb.
[46:07.32]I don't wanna walk forward.
[46:08.80]We're gonna make walk forward two.
[46:13.71]An idea brought me awake one morning in New York.
[46:16.51]I almost didn't write it down.
[46:18.22]Okay.
[46:19.14]Whatever.
[46:19.46]I hear something.
[46:26.42]I hear something.
[46:28.32]You better watch out for those dinosaurs.
[46:31.10]Hey, Sticks Renegade, thank you for the ten bucks.
[46:33.30]If a mosquito sucked the blood of a dinosaur one hundred million years ago,
[46:40.20]The insect is then covered in tree sap, which, over the millennia, becomes amber.
[46:49.65]Are you shitting me right now, guys?
[46:51.59]I'm doing that again.
[46:52.43]And you know why I'm doing that again?
[46:53.37]Because that's a chair.
[46:55.15]That's a chair that breaks when you throw it.
[46:56.73]I'm chairing a fucking dinosaur.
[46:57.97]I'm saving it right there.
[46:59.23]You've got to be kidding me.
[47:01.93]Uh, yeah.
[47:03.01]You don't think I'm gonna save that and fucking WWF chair a dinosaur?
[47:06.26]An idea brought me awake one morning in New York.
[47:09.10]I almost didn't write it down.
[47:11.28]Give me a break.
[47:12.94]It's a breakaway chair.
[47:18.54]What if a mosquito sucked the blood of a dinosaur 100 million years ago?
[47:25.63]Guys, uh... The insect is then covered in... We have some experimental data here.
[47:32.55]I'm sure you guys all know what the experiment is.
[47:40.66]The chair broke when I touched it.
[47:45.42]That's such bullshit.
[47:47.81]Like, honest to God, really.
[47:56.23]What if a mosquito sucked?
[48:05.80]What if a mosquito sucked... What if a mosquito sucked the blood of a dinosaur 100 million years ago?
[48:20.39]The insect is then covered in tree sap, which over the millennia becomes amber.
[48:26.75]Got it.
[48:29.09]Got it.
[48:29.83]Got it.
[48:30.58]Got the chair.
[48:33.93]Oh, here comes Austin with a ball bat.
[48:36.03]He's got a chair.
[48:37.87]Oh, my God.
[48:39.15]Don't do it, Austin.
[48:40.73]Don't do it, Stone Cold.
[48:43.23]Shit.
[48:51.50]This is very anticlimactic, by the way.
[48:54.14]He's just looking at me like, what the fuck are you doing?
[49:15.28]Eight left.
[49:16.72]Seven.
[49:18.04]Five.
[49:18.60]Three.
[49:18.78]One.
[49:19.30]Empty.
[49:20.06]Die!
[49:29.46]What if a mosquito sucked the blood of a dinosaur 100 billion years ago?
[49:36.59]Look, that didn't happen.
[49:37.79]What are you guys talking about?
[49:40.59]I've reloaded.
[49:41.33]Over the millennia?
[49:43.39]Becomes amber.
[49:48.81]You guys thought, no, see the dinosaur's fine.
[49:51.69]See?
[49:54.19]He's fine.
[49:54.71]He's not like mad at me or anything.
[49:57.33]See?
[49:57.79]Can I pet him?
[49:58.75]Let's pet the dinosaur.
[50:00.63]See?
[50:01.91]Oh, he's such a good boy.
[50:02.98]See?
[50:04.02]I'm being friendly to him.
[50:07.12]Oh, what a good dinosaur.
[50:08.36]Oh, you want me to rub your belly?
[50:10.76]Oh, you love when I rub your belly.
[50:14.04]Such a good boy.
[50:31.27]What about your tail?
[50:31.85]Do you like when I rub your tail, too?
[50:33.26]Okay, bye.
[50:40.16]Slap?
[50:40.46]What are you talking about slaps?
[50:43.14]I was not slapping the dinosaur.
[50:44.40]I was just running my hand up and down his back.
[50:53.50]We haven't even gotten to the meat and potatoes, man.
[50:54.96]We're just still outside the research facility.
[50:56.64]But I need to have my gun out.
[50:58.99]The gun being out is very important.
[51:02.17]We haven't even got into Jurassic Park yet.
[51:06.27]Save.
[51:10.85]What if a mosquito sucked the blood of a dinosaur?
[51:20.78]This shit doesn't do anything.
[51:21.94]Like, why does this not do anything?
[51:25.00]I'm trying to make like a fucking stream joke.
[51:27.96]I'm trying to make everyone think I'm a fucking funny streamer.
[51:30.31]Because I was going to have that blow up next to me and be like, whoa, what?
[51:33.15]What happened?
[51:34.17]And I can't fucking do that anymore now.
[51:36.27]How are people ever going to think I'm fucking funny?
[51:38.19]No one's going to think I'm funny anymore because I didn't do the fuel explosion thing.
[51:41.17]Let's go.
[51:55.41]Play this in VR?
[51:57.13]This game's like almost 20 years old.
[51:59.11]I don't think it has VR support.
[52:02.88]I can play on the seesaw, though.
[52:04.00]That is a good thing.
[52:07.46]Okay, let's go.
[52:11.42]Open the doors to Jurassic Park.
[52:19.39]Wait.
[52:21.81]What?
[52:24.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:26.61]What just happened?
[52:29.46]Did I go around in a circle?
[52:31.56]Did I go around in a circle?
[52:34.04]Did I?
[52:37.98]Why didn't anybody tell me I was going backwards?
[52:39.98]When did I start going backwards?
[52:44.53]Huh?
[52:47.95]Is it because I, like, reloaded?
[52:49.31]I know, it's because I reloaded the game, like, three times.
[52:51.17]Where's the Stegosaurus?
[52:52.77]What the fuck just happened?
[52:59.45]Ooh, new gun.
[53:00.03]Why didn't anybody tell me I was going the wrong way?
[53:08.89]Okay, so... Alright.
[53:11.15]Let's just go up here.
[53:14.35]Funny stream joke.
[53:16.09]So where am I supposed to go?
[53:19.23]I am not in control right now.
[53:27.42]Honestly.
[53:28.20]Come on.
[53:30.04]I could go all the way up here, but I can't go that way.
[53:42.82]Oh, fuck it.
[53:43.92]Just go, please.
[53:44.64]There's the Stegosaurus.
[53:50.35]So, up there.
[53:50.89]I'm not going to shoot him.
[53:57.17]Don't worry.
[53:57.69]Nobody has to freak out.
[54:00.03]I'm not entirely sure where the hell I'm supposed to be going, though.
[54:01.87]Like, over here, I guess.
[54:05.62]Surf level.
[54:10.30]What the fuck is this game?
[54:11.32]This is... Okay, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta bogey.
[54:16.46]Here we go.
[54:18.00]Gotta line this up.
[54:18.90]One shot, one shot in the head.
[54:20.23]He's so slow.
[54:20.97]He's so stupid.
[54:22.79]He, he, oh, he... Oh, is he dead?
[54:35.24]You know what's funny?
[54:35.68]People are actually going to think this is a VR game.
[54:40.92]If you came to this stream right now and you had no idea what was going on, this is a VR game.
[54:45.24]Let's just pretend it is.
[54:46.20]Should I just put... I'm going to put the VR helmet on and turn on face cam.
[54:49.43]And just everyone's going to think it's VR.
[54:50.65]Yeah, we'll do that in a minute.
[54:52.25]Sunlight angled down through the dusty air in Norman's office and I leaned against a solid oak table as I outlined my plans for international genetic technologies.
[55:08.33]Can I not... Did I lose the gun?
[55:12.93]I think I lost the gun.
[55:15.71]Got it.
[55:18.63]Um... Tell us what you see, though.
[55:26.58]I'll make it work.
[55:27.80]I'll make it work.
[55:29.50]What am I supposed to do here, by the way?
[55:32.54]Eight left.
[55:34.52]One shot left.
[55:38.73]I look like Slender Man.
[55:40.81]Yeah, this is an extremely long arm.
[55:43.66]Well, you know what?
[55:44.28]Just... I want the board.
[55:55.44]I mean, I kind of need this.
[55:59.41]I got it.
[55:59.71]I got it.
[56:00.01]I got it.
[56:00.25]I know what to do.
[56:10.07]Come on, that was perfect.
[56:11.17]What the fuck is this?
[56:12.49]What is this?
[56:12.87]Is this a bike helmet?
[56:15.35]Can I put it on?
[56:18.23]I want to put the bike helmet on.
[56:19.37]I can't put it on.
[56:25.29]I have to smear it on here.
[56:32.87]I know that's what I have to do.
[56:38.31]And even if that's not what I'm supposed to do, like, I'm gonna do it, because that's what we're doing.
[56:46.23]This really is Surgeon Simulator.
[56:48.33]With the dinosaurs in it.
[56:55.55]Oh, eat shit.
[56:57.27]You guys thought I had to knock the boxes down.
[56:58.82]Oh no, Gerber, you're an idiot, you have to knock the boxes down.
[57:01.74]Oh yeah?
[57:02.14]Did you see the fucking real professional gamer way to get up here?
[57:05.68]I did.
[57:07.99]Eight shots.
[57:13.05]Those wrists.
[57:14.65]Octodad with guns.
[57:21.56]It was the flowering of an ambition born 50 years ago.
[57:24.68]50 years struck.
[57:26.46]By the way, this girl is strong.
[57:30.46]I couldn't pick up a rock like this.
[57:37.60]Okay, well neither can she apparently.
[57:39.82]I love that you can just grab everything random.
[57:41.62]That's so cool.
[57:47.34]My character has a wedding ring.
[57:49.46]That must mean that she's married.
[57:54.60]All right, I see what could be a pretty big encounter here.
[58:00.27]It's just one of these guys, but these things are annoying.
[58:05.41]One shot.
[58:07.04]Okay, now I don't have to kill these.
[58:10.26]I don't have to kill them.
[58:12.14]In fact, I can just throw a basketball at his fucking head and maybe it'll kill him.
[58:15.61]Yep.
[58:19.55]We're going for a basketball kill.
[58:25.01]Think I can shoot the hoop and win?
[58:27.74]Alright, I'm going for it.
[58:28.84]I'm going for a basketball kill.
[58:32.04]I'm riding the dinosaur.
[58:33.74]I'm riding the dinosaur.
[58:36.46]At least I got to ride the dinosaur, mom.
[59:01.81]At least I got to ride the dino!
[59:05.97]No!
[59:06.61]No, stop!
[59:09.17]The world's going black!
[59:13.48]And I saved it all the fucking way back here.
[59:14.94]I became the dinosaur, yeah.
[59:33.05]Next, please?
[59:34.05]Oh, God, no way!
[59:37.99]Next?
[59:38.79]This shit is fucking crazy.
[59:41.12]Dude, we haven't even got to the... We're, like, not even inside.
[59:48.42]You guys want next before the T-Rex shows up?
[59:51.68]Are you guys crazy?
[59:57.70]Load the save.
[59:58.36]Wait.
[60:01.52]I thought it automatically loaded the save.
[60:03.50]Yeah, I was gonna say, what the fuck was that?
[60:05.46]Why did it not, like, load the save?
[60:06.62]It is the flowering of an ambition born 50 years ago.
[60:10.46]50 years' struggle come to this.
[60:14.64]Where did my left arm go?
[60:15.56]I don't know, that's a good question.
[60:20.36]I got it, I got it!
[60:21.55]I thought it was gonna, like, load my save automatically when I died.
[60:25.63]We have to go for a basketball hit here.
[60:28.35]This is actually really important.
[60:32.25]I gotta get a slam dunk dinosaur kill.
[60:38.37]Alright, I'm gonna walk here.
[60:39.24]It's two, right?
[60:40.40]Sneak, no.
[60:41.02]I can't sneak up on him.
[60:49.46]Alright, that obviously ain't gonna work.
[60:53.90]Oh my god, please.
[61:03.48]No, that was so all over the place.
[61:05.17]We're just going to kill the dinosaur.
[61:07.59]We're just going to kill the dinosaur.
[61:08.61]We're just going to kill... That's it.
[61:09.63]It was the flowering of an ambition born 50 years ago.
[61:12.97]He got it at the buzzer.
[61:13.85]50 years struggle.
[61:14.79]Come to this.
[61:15.71]Basketball week.
[61:16.79]Hey, thanks, Sticks Renegade, for another $10.
[61:18.43]It says Michael Germa.
[61:22.47]Thank you, Sticks, again, for your $10.
[61:26.24]Thank you also to Dr. Pigeth for the $5.
[61:29.06]Happy fake real birthday for the third time.
[61:32.12]Cody still sucks and I still love you.
[61:34.02]Well, thanks, man.
[61:36.71]Thank you very much.
[61:38.49]Why would they put the basketball there?
[61:46.03]No, hold on.
[61:47.13]I'm actually going to hold a shotgun in one hand.
[62:13.48]Five rounds left.
[62:20.93]Five rounds left.
[62:24.57]One shot.
[62:26.31]That's it.
[62:27.95]That's it.
[62:28.59]God damn it!
[62:31.57]Oh no!
[62:34.49]Oh, no!
[62:35.87]Oh, what?
[62:36.34]And I didn't fucking save.
[62:39.14]I didn't save back... Fuck!
[62:41.42]Dude, I'm so used to autosave being a thing in, like, the last 30 years.
[62:47.16]That, like, when I don't... I'm going to get that to work.
[62:52.79]And everyone's gonna laugh.
[62:54.51]It's gonna be one of those things that people look back on and they go, Dude, remember when Germo, like, turned that on himself and it was crazy!
[63:03.92]Okay, just stay there.
[63:04.90]Like, I don't want anything to do with you right now.
[63:07.40]Save the game.
[63:08.82]Right here.
[63:10.62]Let's try it again.
[63:12.14]Everyone's gonna be like, holy shit, dude, did you see what this guy did on his stream?
[63:15.06]I don't think that was even possible.
[63:24.97]Six rounds.
[63:33.69]Guys, and then I get to live forever, right?
[63:35.71]Like, I, like, lived in infamy on Twitch TV as the guy that, like, figured it out.
[63:43.79]Five rounds left.
[63:45.69]Five rounds left.
[63:50.66]No, get... I don't want this.
[63:53.22]Five rounds left.
[64:01.81]Five shots.
[64:07.23]God, come on.
[64:18.14]All right, bye-bye, we're done.
[64:23.53]Give me the shotgun and we're moving on.
[64:24.75]Let's go.
[64:37.26]Almost had it.
[64:38.70]Yeah, almost.
[64:42.60]By the way, is this like too loud?
[64:43.86]I can't even tell.
[64:45.76]Hey, thanks for the five dollars.
[64:46.72]I don't know why your name keeps getting deleted.
[64:48.80]But it says, when's the next comb stream?
[64:50.10]Whatever that was, thank you for the five dollars.
[64:54.06]Appreciate that.
[64:55.32]The next comb stream is going to be whenever I feel like doing a comb stream.
[64:59.48]Whenever that ends up happening.
[65:02.46]Left or right?
[65:02.92]Let's go right.
[65:09.97]You can always tell when you're going the right way when Dr. Moreau starts saying a bunch of weird shit to you.
[65:17.88]When I experimented on the dinosaurs and I started cleaning their teeth on a daily basis, I was curious to what kind of plaque they had.
[65:26.10]I guess we go down here?
[65:43.67]Oh, whoa!
[65:44.11]Look at this!
[65:46.37]Are we gonna get to see a fight here?
[65:48.63]I gotta help the Triceratops!
[65:52.29]I gotta help the Triceratops!
[65:53.83]I got you, buddy!
[65:56.67]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[65:57.53]I gotta save the Triceratops!
[65:59.52]Get away from him!
[66:00.86]Get... What is going on?
[66:03.50]What's wrong with my hand?
[66:08.34]I got you.
[66:10.52]Alright.
[66:11.32]You and me are now best friends!
[66:26.14]I want to ride him.
[66:34.28]That's what you get to do in these games.
[66:35.46]You ride the dinosaurs.
[66:39.75]Come on.
[66:39.99]Is there an invisible wall behind his tail or something?
[66:42.21]Come on.
[66:43.39]That's bullshit.
[66:44.75]I should be able to get on his tail.
[66:47.29]I think there's an invisible wall on top of the dinosaurs.
[66:49.67]Wow, no fun.
[66:51.87]Got it.
[66:53.75]Okay.
[66:54.83]Now, go.
[66:56.95]Mush.
[66:57.91]Go that way.
[66:58.57]Go to the left or something.
[67:02.32]Go on.
[67:03.26]Let's go.
[67:08.98]What are you doing?
[67:09.66]Come on.
[67:11.42]Go on.
[67:14.86]Move.
[67:15.98]There we go.
[67:18.51]You guys didn't think there was a fucking dinosaur riding in this game?
[67:21.49]Good job.
[67:28.80]Alright, move.
[67:30.18]You can do it.
[67:32.14]I have faith in you.
[67:36.96]Good boy.
[67:38.24]What a good boy.
[67:39.82]Oh, he's such a good boy.
[67:41.04]I love petting my good boy.
[67:48.99]Oh, I'm falling off here.
[67:50.71]Oh god, this is like, this is seriously just the last guardian.
[67:55.15]Alright, how do I make him, like, Trico, go that way.
[67:59.43]Oh god, he's moving fast.
[68:06.31]Where is he going?
[68:09.62]Where are you going?
[68:10.24]You can't go this way.
[68:11.18]Trico!
[68:16.46]Trico!
[68:18.94]Striker!
[68:19.56]How are your teeth doing?
[68:23.74]See?
[68:24.10]He would never bite me.
[68:25.07]Look!
[68:26.59]My hand is right in his mouth.
[68:27.63]He would never bite me.
[68:28.49]He's my little boy.
[68:30.65]He's my good boy.
[68:31.59]See?
[68:36.13]I think my good boy might be broken.
[68:38.31]I think something happened to my good boy.
[68:39.71]I don't think he works anymore.
[68:43.27]I think my good boy might have just turned into a good boy statue.
[68:48.30]Oh no, there he is, see?
[68:49.04]Good boy, good boy.
[68:51.58]Okay, we'll leave.
[68:58.66]I just wanted to play with my good boy for a minute or two.
[69:01.67]Six left.
[69:03.05]No survivors, by the way.
[69:04.51]I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[69:06.47]I'm kidding.
[69:09.03]He needs to charge his battery.
[69:10.45]Somebody has to plug his USB mini in.
[69:12.93]Six left.
[69:18.42]Where the hell am I going?
[69:22.77]Over to the waterfall?
[69:28.91]What's the Triceratops name?
[69:30.23]Trico.
[69:31.61]Thank you for the five dollars, Action Sloth.
[69:34.35]Also, thank you to Magpie for the ten bucks.
[69:38.62]And they say, uh, if you got your dog a clown car, it would be considered an automobile.
[69:42.82]Kappa.
[69:43.86]Uh, probably, yeah.
[69:46.10]Thank you for the ten bucks, Mac.
[69:47.08]Is this an animal?
[69:47.72]It was even an animal.
[69:49.18]What is she even saying right now?
[69:50.62]Yeah, I think it is.
[69:51.92]Is this seriously out of reach now?
[70:08.72]The gun is out of reach.
[70:09.76]I can't get it.
[70:10.22]I can't crouch in the water.
[70:16.00]Okay.
[70:16.40]Well, that gun's gone.
[70:18.44]Is this like a turtle?
[70:19.20]I'm going to take a turtle with me.
[70:21.24]No.
[70:21.52]Okay.
[70:22.82]That's fine.
[70:24.92]Well, down to just the shotguns.
[70:28.22]We're down to just shotguns.
[70:35.32]The water is loud as hell.
[70:41.94]Can't get my gun.
[70:42.92]My boobs are in the way.
[70:47.24]I gotta fix my wrist.
[70:48.26]Hold on.
[70:52.72]I thought that was a dinosaur.
[70:53.70]It's just a piece of... It's like a twig.
[70:55.16]Phone.
[70:55.64]Oh, thank God.
[70:56.66]Phone.
[70:56.94]Okay.
[70:58.56]Do I have to use the phone?
[71:02.29]Phone.
[71:10.20]Oh, hold on.
[71:11.38]All right, I gotta make a phone call.
[71:12.96]Oh, hold on a second.
[71:16.32]I gotta make a quick phone call.
[71:17.96]Did it work?
[71:22.94]Yeah, is that mom?
[71:24.40]Mommy?
[71:24.86]The main switchboard is temporarily unattended.
[71:27.64]Please contact your supervisor.
[71:29.20]That's fucking awesome.
[71:30.82]Let's do 911.
[71:45.49]Come on!
[71:46.67]Help me, there's dinosaurs!
[71:52.63]Come on!
[71:54.29]The main switchboard is temporarily unattended.
[71:56.99]Please contact your supervisor.
[72:00.45]Wait, how do you... How do you do jingle bells?
[72:04.47]How do you do jingle bells?
[72:07.19]Hold on.
[72:08.73]Hot cross buns, right?
[72:12.83]It's 3, 1, 2... Alright, carry on.
[72:30.30]I tried... I just tried to call 911.
[72:32.06]It didn't work.
[72:34.90]Last time I'm gonna try 911.
[72:42.80]You can't do it, guys.
[72:44.18]I'm not gonna sit there anymore.
[72:45.12]You can't do it.
[72:46.10]3, 4... No!
[72:46.76]No.
[72:47.04]There's another thing.
[72:47.82]There'll be like 10 more phones in this fucking shitty game.
[72:50.40]And that rock was way, way bigger than it looked on the ground.
[72:53.60]But it's okay.
[72:54.55]What about this one?
[72:55.15]Is this a fucking potato rock?
[72:57.41]A carrot rock?
[72:59.79]No, only one carrot rock.
[73:02.29]Okay.
[73:04.59]I gotta go up here.
[73:16.33]We're saved, we're saved, we're saved.
[73:23.16]Jump on the stumps to get up there.
[73:28.06]Watch this, yeah.
[73:29.46]You ready to see the gamer at work?
[73:32.99]You ready to see a fucking real gamer, guys?
[73:35.11]Like, watch this.
[73:36.05]I want to see, like, a ton of praise when I get this done.
[73:38.35]Because watch this.
[73:38.91]This is like a glitch, a little glitched out event here.
[73:44.54]I had it.
[73:45.48]Look at that shit.
[73:46.68]Oh, look.
[73:47.50]Jerma can't get anything done right.
[73:49.32]Jerma can't do anything right, except for that.
[73:50.72]I just got exactly what I needed immediately.
[73:56.47]Yep.
[74:08.17]Don't fall off.
[74:09.97]Get over here.
[74:24.10]Everyone right now is just like... Everyone right now is just like, fuck man.
[74:27.79]If only I could be as good of a gamer as him.
[74:33.97]Alright, bye phone.
[74:37.67]I definitely have to push these down because it's going to be fun.
[74:40.77]I hear another dinosaur.
[74:41.69]That's good.
[74:44.67]Where's the last one right there?
[74:45.89]Alright, I'm going to try to drop one of these on his head.
[74:52.32]When he gets close enough, I'm going to crush his head.
[74:56.50]Come here.
[74:57.46]Come on.
[74:58.88]Get right underneath here.
[75:00.58]So I can just drop this piano on you.
[75:04.80]Come on.
[75:06.98]Come on.
[75:09.02]Come on.
[75:10.78]No, no, no.
[75:11.16]Don't go that way.
[75:11.76]Come up this way.
[75:17.25]Alright.
[75:17.49]Is he underneath?
[75:19.11]He's almost underneath.
[75:21.58]Which way is he, though?
[75:23.34]There he is.
[75:24.14]Come on!
[75:24.52]Back here!
[75:24.94]Back here!
[75:25.24]Back here!
[75:25.52]Back here!
[75:25.78]Come on!
[75:34.52]No!
[75:35.14]Shit!
[75:35.48]I lost it.
[75:36.54]I got him.
[75:37.30]It actually hit him.
[75:38.93]I didn't even mean to do that and it still hit him.
[75:40.41]It's okay.
[75:46.55]Alright, where is he?
[75:49.09]Well, that's gone.
[75:51.55]He's gonna hate me, isn't he?
[76:15.58]He's gonna-
[76:28.21]Just like that, it's over.
[76:32.39]Hold on.
[76:32.79]What the fuck is happening to me?
[76:38.66]You forgot to save?
[76:39.46]I saved.
[76:46.95]I love how they're moving me around.
[76:48.39]Shit.
[76:52.29]I so badly want one of these guys to pick me up and like... This is like fucking horrible.
[77:01.15]I saved it back here.
[77:01.98]We're good.
[77:03.64]Was it worth it?
[77:05.20]I didn't think I was gonna die right there.
[77:08.86]I didn't think I was gonna... Oh, shit.
[77:13.76]I didn't... I gotta remember that I need to save every fucking 30 seconds.
[77:23.60]Come on, fall, fall.
[77:25.10]I don't want to do that.
[77:28.42]I hope there's like scientists in this game.
[77:30.34]Because holy shit, man.
[77:32.26]I want to throw a board at like a fucking scientist's head.
[77:34.88]This would be game of the year.
[77:37.22]This would be game of the year 1999.
[77:38.70]If I could like whip a fucking brick at a scientist's head.
[77:47.04]Okay, so don't, you can't just jump off.
[77:49.06]I need to go over here.
[77:50.99]Easier, easy, easy, easy.
[77:53.45]That almost killed me, I think.
[77:54.69]But it's okay.
[77:55.82]Just need to come over here.
[77:57.98]There's a gun right there, but I'm just going to shoot him right in the head.
[78:00.72]Come on.
[78:03.86]I need to be... Again, he's turning into the turkey now.
[78:06.34]That's fine.
[78:07.18]There's one more.
[78:07.78]I don't want to use that.
[78:15.07]I don't want to use this thing.
[78:18.03]Six rounds.
[78:19.23]Yep, yep, yep.
[78:21.33]Okay, here he comes.
[78:21.97]There's two of them.
[78:23.31]Save.
[78:23.97]Thank you.
[78:24.81]Thank you very much.
[78:25.79]Yes, I will save.
[78:28.31]You got it.
[78:29.73]Now, aim it up.
[78:32.61]That got all fucked up right there, guys.
[78:42.58]That got all fucked up.
[78:43.34]And there's another one, like, behind me.
[78:44.74]No, there's not.
[78:45.16]I don't know what the hell that was then.
[78:46.50]No, he's dead.
[78:49.90]There is one more, though.
[78:52.97]Yeah, there he is.
[79:01.51]Perfect.
[79:03.49]Absolutely perfect.
[79:05.29]Couldn't have been any better.
[79:07.33]You find me a streamer that could do that better.
[79:11.65]Ain't gonna fucking happen.
[79:17.94]Recoil on the revolver, but none on the shotgun.
[79:20.50]Yeah, that seems a little odd.
[79:27.88]three left.
[79:34.45]We're almost inside of Jurassic Park.
[79:37.25]It's gonna happen really soon.
[79:40.07]Just you... For a second I thought that was going to kill me.
[79:47.19]I was about to be very upset.
[79:52.44]More box... More stupid box platforming.
[79:54.86]Can't wait for this.
[79:57.00]Something up there.
[79:59.55]What is that?
[80:00.29]That's like a different... That's a new gun.
[80:03.28]Oh, boy.
[80:03.64]I know.
[80:03.98]Okay.
[80:04.42]So... Okay.
[80:08.30]We're throwing rocks up there, right?
[80:09.58]That's what it wants us to do.
[80:16.79]Oh, look at that.
[80:17.49]Come on.
[80:17.95]Where did that come from?
[80:29.23]Come on.
[80:29.65]I'm going from the other side.
[80:41.79]Just like Jenga.
[80:42.91]Make the whole damn thing fall down.
[80:44.11]There we go.
[80:49.63]And what was it?
[80:51.15]It was... Oh, nice.
[80:56.51]This is like... Wait, what if it hasn't been used?
[81:00.80]How many bullets are in it?
[81:01.60]That's an odd way to put that.
[81:03.76]Okay, so I want this and I want the shotgun.
[81:08.58]Five rounds left.
[81:09.76]Okay, good.
[81:10.92]Five rounds left.
[81:11.92]Hasn't been used.
[81:13.32]Hasn't been used.
[81:14.14]Okay, so what happens if I use it?
[81:15.16]Okay, now what does she say?
[81:21.32]Five rounds left.
[81:24.44]Full clip.
[81:26.79]That doesn't help.
[81:28.45]That doesn't help.
[81:38.14]Shave my hair?
[81:38.94]What do you mean shave my hair?
[81:40.94]I need the box now.
[81:42.65]Oh, that's annoying.
[81:44.31]Just throw this up there.
[81:45.03]I'll get it.
[81:47.49]Please tell me that that made it.
[81:48.43]I'm going to be so fucking mad if it didn't.
[81:52.51]Come on.
[81:52.83]Push it.
[81:53.11]Move it.
[81:53.47]Like that.
[81:58.52]That's fine.
[82:00.91]She's very strong.
[82:02.59]Very strong.
[82:04.48]There we go.
[82:06.16]Saving it.
[82:07.80]I see a lot of dinosaur bones.
[82:09.06]I think we're gonna get our first T-Rex.
[82:11.10]What do you guys think?
[82:16.56]Hey, Kaiju brother!
[82:19.06]Looks like a wet noodle of an arm.
[82:21.64]It is.
[82:23.18]It is a very noodle arm.
[82:26.66]We got an open field here.
[82:27.56]We might get... I think this is our first real encounter.
[82:29.40]I think this is the boss.
[82:32.43]What do you guys think?
[82:33.05]T-Rex boss?
[82:35.23]I got plenty of guns.
[82:37.41]Big open field.
[82:38.30]It's definitely going to be like a Tyrannosaurus.
[82:45.76]No.
[82:46.86]It's just a Brontosaurus.
[82:49.25]We've already seen these before.
[82:50.81]A lost world is a sort of scientific myth.
[82:55.63]An evolutionary scenario in which an ecosystem is isolated and preserved.
[83:01.03]Do the VR joke.
[83:01.53]The rest of the world changes.
[83:03.35]I'm gonna do the VR joke.
[83:04.59]What are you doing here?
[83:06.11]Ancient species survive.
[83:09.69]Yadda yadda yadda.
[83:11.29]Yadda yadda yadda.
[83:12.90]Yadda yadda yadda.
[83:15.03]Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[83:16.63]Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[83:18.23]Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[83:19.87]Okay.
[83:21.87]Oh no, it's Alan Watts again.
[83:23.78]You see, if you didn't know, the universe is made up of 20,000 different species.
[83:29.94]One of them is the Tyrannosaurus.
[83:34.64]And... What is he doing?
[83:41.00]You see, one of these monsters...
[83:50.96]That won't get annoying.
[83:53.22]No, it will get annoying.
[83:54.06]That's why I stopped doing it.
[83:57.40]In the winter, we began building the supports for the elevated transit system that would unify the island.
[84:03.16]Hold on.
[84:04.02]Concrete towers rose through the jungle canopy.
[84:08.29]Around 10.
[84:09.77]Around 10.
[84:10.59]I can't even carry this.
[84:14.35]What am I supposed to do with that?
[84:15.71]Like, seriously.
[84:17.93]How am I supposed to do this?
[84:22.95]I didn't save it either!
[84:23.79]I didn't save it!
[84:29.22]Dammit.
[84:31.92]I thought I could pick that gun up.
[84:35.71]I can't pick that gun up, it's too heavy.
[84:41.11]Well, now I know.
[84:41.81]Now I know that my weak ass fucking wrists can't pick that up.
[84:44.63]It's the only gun I haven't been able to pick up.
[84:46.40]But I can pick up giant rocks and huge 400 pound boxes.
[84:50.58]That makes sense.
[84:51.14]Oh well.
[85:01.06]Imagine if I could zoom in on myself.
[85:04.96]Zoom in on myself.
[85:06.56]And just blow my face.
[85:07.82]I don't want to fight these things, but I'm gonna.
[85:09.60]Oh, God.
[85:09.92]Yadda, yadda, yadda.
[85:23.07]This is not a good position to be in.
[85:27.13]And like, so this is like, honest to fucking god, and now there's no ammo.
[85:43.08]What just happened?
[85:48.28]I don't even know what happened.
[85:57.16]Okay.
[85:59.06]I'm not reloading it.
[86:00.40]I don't even care.
[86:03.84]I shot myself?
[86:06.10]By the way, guys, reload?
[86:08.39]What is reload?
[86:09.19]Because I can't do it.
[86:10.17]She just says yadda yadda yadda.
[86:16.83]What is reload, then?
[86:20.94]Replay.
[86:22.20]No, there is no reload.
[86:25.72]R is yadda yadda yadda.
[86:27.93]I just got to get up here.
[86:35.78]I'm going to clear these guys out.
[86:37.22]Here comes one.
[86:39.28]This is not even the right spot.
[86:41.00]Here we go.
[86:41.30]Here comes another one.
[87:00.72]Seriously fucking please die.
[87:03.66]Okay.
[87:06.84]In the winter we began building the supports for the elevated transit system that would unify the island.
[87:13.43]Concrete towers rose through the jungle canopy.
[87:23.87]How the fuck are you supposed to use this?
[87:28.69]Honest to God?
[87:29.57]How the fuck are you supposed to use this?
[87:32.15]It gets like that.
[87:39.73]Hold on.
[87:41.33]Hold on a second.
[87:53.40]Quickscope.
[87:54.38]There is no rhyme or reason for this gun.
[87:58.74]You can't even zoom in with this thing.
[88:06.69]This doesn't... Why would it be like this?
[88:13.57]Four bullets.
[88:15.11]Let's head it.
[88:15.53]Can I knock this over?
[88:23.91]Four shots.
[88:25.25]Three left.
[88:30.98]Come on you motherfucker aim it down One shot one shot left one shot Empty empty god damn it empty empty ah I can never get it to work God damn it feels about half ah Oh, well, I tried I
[89:06.16]You had one shot.
[89:08.13]Pretty much.
[89:10.63]This is so sloppy, by the way.
[89:12.03]How the hell am I supposed to... I guess like that.
[89:23.30]No, nothing worse than an empty gun when you want to shoot yourself in the head.
[89:26.26]Yeah, I know, really.
[89:29.52]Oh, God.
[89:30.02]Just put this away so I can get my hand back out.
[89:34.17]Now I have to, like, push this, right?
[89:39.97]I'm going to sneeze.
[89:41.43]Coming up out of the southern base in the Atherton Causeway would bring visiting scientists north from the southern beach.
[89:47.39]I dropped the shotgun because it was empty.
[89:50.26]There's nothing left in the shotgun.
[89:53.18]By the way, one fall from here.
[89:55.38]They certainly were serious about their monorail.
[90:00.66]I knew it.
[90:01.04]I was going to say, I'm going to fuck this up.
[90:04.20]Save it.
[90:05.04]Screw this.
[90:05.90]We're just going to save state.
[90:06.94]They certainly were serious about their monorail.
[90:11.33]See?
[90:11.72]And that's why we did it.
[90:12.74]That is the reason why we did that.
[90:14.68]That's why we just did that.
[90:15.88]Thank God I did it.
[90:17.30]Wow.
[90:18.58]They certainly were serious about their monorail.
[90:21.18]Fuckin' break.
[90:26.04]Wow.
[90:27.32]They certainly were serious about their monorail.
[90:33.50]Can I not make this jump?
[90:35.24]Wow.
[90:35.54]I don't understand.
[90:36.60]They certainly were serious about their monorail.
[90:40.29]I'm hitting an invisible fucking wall.
[90:43.38]Whatever.
[90:49.62]When do I get into Jurassic Park?
[90:51.16]I'm outside on the fucking monorail.
[90:53.02]I want to go into the... Cool.
[90:58.69]This really is like a trip to the dentist.
[90:59.99]You're right.
[91:07.67]My...
[91:10.00]Was that supposed to jump scare me or something?
[91:11.38]Like, why is it doing that?
[91:15.68]Hold on.
[91:15.98]Okay, I just wanted to see if I could move it.
[91:29.84]Because that would be fucking hilarious.
[91:32.51]You're already inside?
[91:33.37]I'm not in Jurassic Park right now.
[91:35.07]I'm in the outside.
[91:36.83]Welcome to the initial Disney World when you go on the monorail and you look at all the rides.
[91:45.81]I didn't... No.
[91:46.55]I didn't want to do that.
[91:49.05]God.
[91:49.69]Has the fucking pipe gone... No.
[91:52.40]It's right there.
[91:57.68]Like this.
[91:58.38]And then down.
[91:59.10]And then I can use it as a weapon.
[92:01.08]Perfect.
[92:03.04]There is like an outhouse down there.
[92:04.34]What is in there?
[92:05.20]If there's a gun in there, I might have to go down there.
[92:06.62]Can anybody tell?
[92:08.76]No.
[92:10.20]It's just a shitty outhouse.
[92:12.22]Hit myself with a pipe.
[92:23.34]You guys hear that?
[92:23.90]Oh, it's just this guy.
[92:26.20]It's just that useless fucking enemy.
[92:33.93]Use that to jump.
[92:38.61]Use this to jump.
[92:42.55]Shotgun down there, though.
[92:44.35]Okay, good.
[92:44.61]There's a way to get up.
[92:47.65]I gotta be... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:49.11]This is gonna kill me.
[92:56.36]Oh, yes.
[92:56.94]Okay.
[92:59.02]There's a gun here, too.
[93:01.34]Dude, why would you even carry around a melee weapon?
[93:03.98]This is so awful.
[93:06.37]Like, watch.
[93:06.73]Let me just, like, hit this fucking dinosaur with my pro bar.
[93:10.69]Oh, I missed.
[93:13.13]That means I'm dead.
[93:15.51]Wish I had a fucking shotgun.
[93:17.63]Eight left.
[93:33.95]Oh, fuck.
[93:35.43]I have half a clip.
[93:39.55]The roof?
[93:42.01]What do you mean the roof?
[93:46.50]What are you guys talking about?
[93:48.90]I got seven shotgun shots.
[93:50.10]Why would I need to go to the roof?
[93:56.56]I have two great weapons.
[93:59.83]I'm not going to go trade any of these in.
[94:01.17]Why would I do that?
[94:06.39]Roof of shotgun.
[94:07.49]What are you talking about?
[94:12.14]What is this?
[94:12.80]Are you talking about this?
[94:13.50]There's nothing in there.
[94:18.60]Is there like a president here or something?
[94:20.24]What are you guys talking about?
[94:22.34]There's nothing there.
[94:24.38]Oh, the roof of the outhouse.
[94:25.96]Well, who cares?
[94:26.94]There's an AK.
[94:31.03]How the hell do you guys know that?
[94:34.01]Did I just not see it?
[94:39.47]Oh, it's too far away.
[94:40.53]Nope, it's over.
[94:41.90]We're gonna move.
[94:45.34]Nah, I ain't going back all the way back there.
[94:46.78]Are you kidding me?
[94:52.44]I think I barely just got that.
[94:54.00]You think I'll be able to get... No.
[94:55.14]I'm just leaving it.
[95:07.98]None of this shit.
[95:15.80]It's just, hey, look, all the guns I'm gonna get later on anyways, so who cares?
[95:19.75]We're about to get to the next part of the level.
[95:20.97]Hey, don't even matter, because all your guns disappear after the end of the level anyways.
[95:24.39]Remember last time?
[95:28.07]You guys should remember that.
[95:29.33]Ow!
[95:32.79]Ow!
[95:34.90]Alright, keep going.
[95:43.84]Resident Evil 7 DLC.
[95:47.03]You're the worst trespasser streamer ever.
[95:50.75]Yeah?
[95:51.69]Well, isn't that just too bad?
[95:53.41]I'm the only trespasser streamer.
[95:56.79]Ain't no fucking competition.
[95:58.23]I'm all you got.
[96:01.61]See?
[96:01.93]Look.
[96:02.69]I don't have any weapons.
[96:04.19]They all disappear anyways.
[96:06.94]Oh, look at that.
[96:07.88]What's this?
[96:09.06]A free sick gun?
[96:11.90]All you guys were complaining about it?
[96:14.06]And a military-style bike helmet?
[96:16.12]Hmm.
[96:19.64]1981.
[96:20.91]I stumbled out of the helicopter already beginning to sweat and looked around at the lush forest.
[96:26.75]The wet leaves.
[96:30.49]Accident.
[96:35.37]Accident.
[96:35.75]It's okay.
[96:38.49]Really?
[96:43.37]The first task was genetic recovery.
[96:46.42]This is Wilford Brimley.
[96:48.60]No, it's still the same enemy.
[96:54.06]What the fuck are you doing?
[96:55.62]What is going on with this gun?
[97:16.70]Great work.
[97:18.22]Great fucking work.
[97:19.42]The first task was genetic recovery.
[97:22.37]Acquiring Jurassic or Cretaceous Amber, extracting preserved DNA, and reassembling the complete sequence.
[97:36.36]The first task was genetic recovery.
[97:39.34]Requiring Jurassic or Cretaceous Amber, extracting preserved DNA and reassembling the complete sequence.
[97:46.57]This is so stupid.
[97:48.01]Bringing it up to the well, we called it.
[97:50.55]Okay, goddammit, please.
[97:54.13]No, don't start turning my wrist around, please.
[97:58.82]What have I done?
[97:59.44]I was trying to, like, center it.
[98:00.90]There we go.
[98:05.77]This is a stealth mission.
[98:07.73]German.
[98:08.21]No.
[98:08.41]No next.
[98:08.97]Guys, this is... I'm in this one for the long haul at this point.
[98:18.52]I need to see what else is in this game.
[98:22.46]It's important.
[98:22.82]Whatever.
[98:23.16]Whatever.
[98:36.52]Really?
[98:39.96]Honest to God, those are not hitting him?
[98:41.60]What the fuck, man?
[98:46.93]Come on!
[98:48.49]Whatever.
[98:52.03]Whatever.
[99:17.96]God dammit man, this gun is a piece of shit by the way.
[99:22.20]It's so hard to hit anything.
[99:25.44]What the fuck?
[99:26.64]Why did that kill itself?
[99:30.79]God, man.
[99:32.73]This really is playing Octodad.
[99:34.97]This is just Octodad with one hand.
[99:48.25]Hey, never trust a purple, thanks for the ten bucks.
[99:53.09]I just got here and I'm crying.
[99:54.31]What the fuck is this game?
[99:55.45]This is Trespasser, man.
[99:57.57]This is the game I was trying to get to work two days ago.
[99:59.93]Okay.
[100:07.19]Oh, nice VR game.
[100:13.35]Alright, well, there's gotta be a reason why I would come up here.
[100:17.03]Eight shots.
[100:19.97]What is going on?
[100:23.65]Okay.
[100:25.85]Why am I freaking the fuck out right now?
[100:30.95]I'm going the long way.
[100:35.55]May I go to the bathroom?
[100:36.45]Yes, you may, Axian.
[100:37.99]You may go to the bathroom.
[100:41.11]This is a shotgun?
[100:42.49]Or is that a rocket launcher?
[100:43.63]Why would I think this is a rocket launcher?
[100:47.91]What the fuck am I talking about?
[100:50.19]Okay.
[100:55.36]Into the water we go.
[100:56.26]I just want to get to the Tyrannosaurus.
[101:07.98]That is the most important thing.
[101:09.53]It just is.
[101:16.19]Six.
[101:16.67]Five.
[101:18.21]That's never going to get old.
[101:18.95]Hey, Sherbert.
[101:21.17]Thank you for the $10.
[101:21.99]Jerm, I've been watching you forever.
[101:22.97]Without you, I wouldn't be doing YouTube.
[101:24.81]Thank you.
[101:25.19]Well, Sherbert, that's fucking awesome of you to say.
[101:30.54]I'm glad you're doing YouTube.
[101:31.98]Hopefully, you're doing well.
[101:33.04]Hopefully, things are going well.
[101:33.86]Hopefully, you're enjoying yourself.
[101:35.18]Hopefully, shit's going good.
[101:37.52]Just like this one.
[101:43.83]I haven't saved it.
[101:46.93]Where's the gun?
[101:47.69]He took the gun.
[101:52.07]He took the gun too!
[101:53.07]Gun!
[101:53.31]Helicopter?
[101:55.07]Shit.
[101:58.25]What is going on right now?
[102:11.96]There's, like, so many guns over here.
[102:13.24]Good.
[102:13.38]I don't... Jesus.
[102:17.96]My god, please.
[102:25.01]Ugh!
[102:28.79]Oh, what the hell happened to my... Did my stream just die?
[102:33.49]No.
[102:34.21]Hold on.
[102:35.21]My chat's dead, though.
[102:37.01]Hold on.
[102:37.33]I gotta reload chat.
[102:40.08]Let me just reload my chat real quick.
[102:42.48]I don't know why, why the fuck does this happen, like, lately?
[102:47.29]Lately, my chat just, like, doesn't work anymore.
[102:50.53]Just, like, I have to, like, refresh it, like, five times a stream.
[102:53.39]It's kind of annoying.
[102:55.71]Actually, very, very fucking annoying.
[102:58.92]Alright, let's go.
[103:00.12]Back to it.
[103:03.68]Save.
[103:04.40]Save it.
[103:04.70]Yes, okay.
[103:10.14]I can see you now, don't worry.
[103:10.98]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[103:15.04]Uh, let's... How much was in the... Only two left.
[103:17.70]Only two left.
[103:18.76]I don't want this fucking thing.
[103:22.35]How much is in here?
[103:22.93]About a dozen.
[103:23.79]A dozen, okay.
[103:25.35]Let's get the regular gun then.
[103:26.75]I thought that was my left hand.
[103:29.43]Alright, keep going.
[103:33.87]Did I hear about these changes to Twitch?
[103:36.11]What, uh... What are the changes to Twitch?
[103:42.19]I mean, I've heard about some, like, new features coming out.
[103:46.21]Besides that.
[103:52.29]Besides that.
[103:54.29]Hold on a second.
[103:58.18]My, like, mother just texted me.
[103:59.70]Hold on.
[104:07.14]What did my mother just say?
[104:16.29]No, I gotta talk to mom for a second.
[104:40.68]Alright.
[104:48.68]Alright, we're good.
[104:49.70]Don't worry.
[104:50.04]It's just my mommy.
[104:51.50]She just wanted to know something.
[104:58.26]She's doing well.
[105:01.58]Joke incoming.
[105:02.30]No, there's no joke.
[105:03.50]My mother just texted me.
[105:05.65]There's the joke.
[105:12.17]Tell your mother you're busy.
[105:13.43]I just told her.
[105:13.95]I said, hey!
[105:14.51]I answered her question.
[105:15.23]I said... Uh-oh.
[105:17.97]We have a different one.
[105:19.73]This one has... This one's poisonous.
[105:21.41]That's how you can tell when it has the red stripes on it.
[105:23.97]New enemy type.
[105:25.49]Poisonous velociraptor.
[105:27.30]Did I just scare him away?
[105:29.36]What is he doing?
[105:43.00]Is he not hostile?
[105:44.72]No, he definitely is.
[105:49.72]I don't know.
[105:50.22]I'm kind of scared.
[105:51.58]If I don't have to shoot... God damn it.
[105:55.60]Jesus!
[105:55.78]Don't you... Don't you do that.
[105:58.22]Okay.
[106:16.34]Alright, we're good.
[106:20.10]Save it.
[106:20.78]You're right, save.
[106:24.91]He tripped, he like flipped over the thing.
[106:31.03]I've yet to find out what the purpose of these things is, though.
[106:34.07]These things is, these things are.
[106:36.76]No real reason to do, I mean, maybe there's like a shortcut.
[106:39.86]We aren't doing the shortcut, we're doing the general route.
[106:43.30]We're taking the scripted general route.
[106:49.87]Give me a fucking rock, too.
[106:51.49]I feel more safe when I have a rock in my hand.
[106:55.20]See?
[107:18.92]It's nine.
[107:24.02]Yeah.
[107:24.56]Okay.
[107:31.26]How is it shaking around so much?
[107:42.41]Got him.
[107:43.33]Thank God.
[107:45.65]What?
[107:50.97]I was in heights.
[107:52.11]Phone day.
[107:54.01]Alright, I wanna get inside.
[107:55.46]Where's the other dinosaurs?
[107:58.16]I'm sick of shooting little velociraptors.
[108:12.59]Can we have a new... And what's with all the random guns?
[108:14.55]I'm just realizing this now.
[108:15.85]Whose guns are these?
[108:16.57]You fucking stay right there.
[108:17.89]Hold on, can I... Can I push that on him?
[108:40.12]The raptor took shape inside its egg and I watched it on the ultrasound monitor.
[108:44.04]It looked like a ghost.
[108:45.86]Give me a second here, guys.
[108:46.82]This is important.
[108:48.10]We are going that way, I think.
[108:49.42]I'm going to see.
[108:49.92]Eight shots.
[108:55.44]No, fucking I don't care anymore.
[108:58.52]Shoot the truck, but that's wasting money.
[109:00.20]I don't want to waste any fucking bullet money.
[109:05.00]Fine, I'll shoot it.
[109:05.70]You want me to waste it?
[109:07.19]I only have eight shots in this gun.
[109:10.07]Okay, I'll do it.
[109:10.67]I just like, bopped him on the head.
[109:36.71]I don't care how far back this is, this is important.
[109:41.90]It's nine.
[109:47.36]I don't care, guys.
[109:48.52]We have to do this.
[109:49.97]I want to see what happens.
[109:58.29]It's right here.
[109:58.81]Don't worry.
[110:01.73]It's nine.
[110:02.37]Eight.
[110:06.49]Six.
[110:07.17]Five.
[110:13.75]November 1983.
[110:16.29]There's a rock under the truck.
[110:19.35]Look at it.
[110:19.91]Okay.
[110:21.93]I'm going to save it here.
[110:22.63]Don't worry.
[110:26.23]You know what she sounds like?
[110:28.43]You know when your MacBook tells you what time it is?
[110:32.05]It's five o'clock.
[110:34.23]Ready?
[110:34.41]What happened to the shotgun?
[110:43.32]When she goes... It's three o'clock.
[110:48.88]Right?
[110:50.46]Here we go.
[110:59.05]I don't have a Mac.
[110:59.89]I just know what a Mac does.
[111:01.29]Alright, so let's get rid of you.
[111:03.49]Let's actually like... Let's do this together.
[111:06.28]Get out of here.
[111:10.16]This is my show.
[111:28.45]Okay, car falling on me doesn't hurt me.
[111:32.29]That's good to know.
[111:33.49]Remember, kids, if a car falls from 150 feet in the air and lands on you, you're going to be fine.
[111:42.50]I need to do a little bit more research here.
[111:43.86]The raptor took shape inside its egg and I watched it on the ultrasound monitor.
[111:48.40]It looked like a ghost or a puff of smoke.
[111:56.44]I wanted to see if he still died.
[112:06.75]Look out!
[112:07.19]Look out!
[112:07.41]Look out!
[112:08.09]Oh!
[112:08.23]Somebody said, look at the rock.
[112:24.24]Why?
[112:25.48]Not this one.
[112:26.30]The other one.
[112:27.50]What's with this rock?
[112:28.48]What's with this walk?
[112:31.96]Why am I looking at this rock?
[112:33.08]I don't understand.
[112:39.85]Why do you want me to look at the rock?
[112:45.95]Not those rocks.
[112:47.73]What rocks are you talking about?
[112:50.79]Ow.
[112:51.45]Rest.
[112:53.10]Look closer?
[113:09.52]That's what you wanted me to look at?
[113:12.96]Looks like seven.
[113:14.00]Some, like, shitty Steven Spielberg, uh, like, rock over here, whatever it is.
[113:23.64]Steven Spielberg didn't even have anything to do with this game.
[113:25.95]Seven shots.
[113:31.67]Oh, she's not there.
[113:32.59]They're minerals.
[113:34.63]Alright, let's go.
[113:36.63]Gotta duck.
[113:38.15]I knew I had to duck there.
[113:42.23]Whose tombstone is this?
[113:44.52]Let's see what it says.
[113:48.41]Here lies.
[113:48.93]No joke.
[113:55.40]German couldn't come up with something fast enough, so he threw it.
[113:58.79]Money throw.
[113:59.35]He was very involved in this game, was he really?
[114:01.87]He was like super involved in this game.
[114:28.35]Hold on, hold on.
[114:29.19]Give me one second.
[114:33.23]Oh, shit.
[114:36.56]We're going to confuse people now.
[114:40.54]Give me a second.
[114:42.08]We're going to confuse people.
[114:43.12]Hopefully this doesn't crash the fucking game, but it probably will.
[114:46.31]Place your bets.
[114:48.95]Here we go.
[114:59.60]second.

[116:14.24]I gotta go by my sense of smell here.
[116:18.13]Why did I just think it was gonna happen?
[116:20.23]Okay, here we go.
[116:21.85]This is not a normal situation.
[116:27.45]Okay, this is like tricky, guys.
[116:29.19]I hear music.
[116:37.91]I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing.
[116:48.49]I don't understand what I'm supposed to be looking at.
[116:59.46]Shit!
[116:59.64]This is so hard!
[117:08.85]There's an actual T-Rex!
[117:31.67]Get this shit off me.
[117:33.19]Get off me.
[117:34.02]Get off me.
[117:35.56]Hold on.
[117:37.44]Why did the T-Rex have to fucking show up right there?
[117:45.72]Oh my god.
[117:47.22]Okay, well.
[117:48.73]We're going back.
[117:49.43]We're going back.
[117:50.01]Okay.
[118:05.40]What am I supposed to do about the T-Rex?
[118:08.66]Am I supposed to do something in particular?
[118:12.49]What am I supposed to do?
[118:14.59]Where am I supposed to go?
[118:17.15]Where is he going?
[118:21.77]Is he coming from me?
[118:23.03]I can't even tell.
[118:48.79]That's it.
[118:49.27]What happened to the music?
[118:54.81]Oh, God.
[118:55.57]Oh, wait.
[118:55.91]There's a shotgun up here.
[118:58.41]Empty.
[118:59.09]No, that's my gun.
[119:05.21]I think we just have to run.
[119:06.37]Tyrannosaurus rex.
[119:08.59]Tyrant lizard.
[119:10.57]They reigned for 25 million years.
[119:13.77]He grew seven of them.
[119:15.59]The seven rulers of the island.
[119:24.65]God damn it!
[119:31.28]What?
[119:32.10]This little shit is hurting me.
[119:33.44]Come on.
[119:33.88]I don't have any weapons.
[119:40.21]He's kind of a dumbass.
[119:41.23]That's okay.
[119:45.63]We're just going to keep going.
[119:50.50]There's definitely going to be a bazooka down here.
[119:52.74]Further down.
[119:54.73]And despite what we've been led to believe, the T-Rex was not a scavenger at all.
[119:59.43]Where is he going?
[120:00.77]Why does the T-Rex look so little?
[120:05.11]Use the truck.
[120:07.27]Oh my god, you're fucking right.
[120:11.12]You're right.
[120:11.92]If only I had any notion that that could have... Oh man, that would have been so awesome.
[120:16.06]If I dropped the truck on his ass.
[120:17.18]That would have been so cool.
[120:20.02]Oh well.
[120:27.15]Another T-Rex.
[120:29.39]What is that?
[120:29.81]No, that's like a T-Rex that got his head closed in a book.
[120:42.00]Wait, hold on.
[120:43.24]What is he doing?
[120:43.94]Why did he just sit like that?
[120:50.62]Does he see me coming?
[121:00.74]These things aren't aggressive, right?
[121:03.02]Aren't these things the friendly T-Rexes?
[121:06.75]I think they are.
[121:09.05]These things don't attack on sight.
[121:11.95]Good.
[121:17.31]Okay, well, we're fine.
[121:26.88]I hope it doesn't attack me.
[121:31.79]It's a herbivore.
[121:39.05]Why are you here?
[121:40.65]Come on, please save me.
[121:41.91]Save me, book T-Rex.
[121:43.65]Come on.
[121:44.73]Come on, please.
[121:46.05]Fight him.
[121:46.45]Fight him, come on.
[121:47.51]Fight him, you fucking weird looking giraffe.
[121:48.99]Fight him.
[121:50.35]Come on, go for it.
[121:51.26]Fucking help me.
[121:52.86]Save me.
[121:55.12]Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.
[122:01.54]No, they're just like walking.
[122:04.43]What are they doing?
[122:05.15]This is a standoff?
[122:06.01]Come on.
[122:08.34]He's stalking him.
[122:11.44]nine shots what are you doing no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no please okay use this as cover he won't be able to get me it's not
[122:57.45]He's like, hey!
[122:58.59]Did you see that little thing he just did?
[123:02.57]Is he done with me?
[123:03.32]Okay.
[123:04.02]I wasted all that ammo.
[123:05.90]What was that little jump?
[123:08.80]Get out of here.
[123:09.46]Please get away from me.
[123:12.50]Oh god, he's still chasing me.
[123:14.34]This is not good.
[123:15.24]This is not good.
[123:17.02]He's gonna run at me like right now.
[123:18.18]Okay, we're good.
[123:19.04]Let's just stand off.
[123:21.94]I want these two to fight.
[123:27.53]I feel like they can fight, but they just don't feel like it.
[123:32.77]So, we're just going down here.
[123:34.85]Fuck it, whatever.
[123:36.73]They're just looking at each other over and over again.
[123:41.51]Wait.
[123:43.13]Hold on.
[123:46.45]He's doing the thing that cats do when you see them, like, you turn the light on, they're in a room that you don't... Okay, he's coming for me again.
[123:52.41]Not enough time to make, like, a joke.
[123:56.30]He can't even fit down here.
[123:59.98]I'm gonna be safe because he's not gonna be able to make it down here.
[124:10.75]I want him to come down here, actually.
[124:14.79]Save?
[124:15.23]Oh shit, you're right.
[124:16.01]Save.
[124:19.89]I want him to come over here.
[124:22.21]What the fuck are they doing?
[124:25.43]Alright, I want him to follow me down here.
[124:29.47]I don't think he's going to be able to make it down here.
[124:31.07]It's going to be funny.
[124:31.75]Because he's going to be doing the stupid cat-chicken thing.
[124:36.21]Come on!
[124:38.07]Get over here!
[124:39.37]Why are you being such a weirdo now?
[124:44.74]Why are you being so strange now?
[124:46.44]You were being so aggressive earlier.
[124:47.70]Now you're just being like a curious little kitty cat.
[124:51.24]You want to smell that?
[124:52.38]There he goes.
[124:56.41]That rock's too big.
[124:57.37]Okay, too big.
[125:00.53]There we go.
[125:08.57]Come on, follow me.
[125:10.33]Come on.
[125:11.77]Come on, you sack of shit.
[125:12.95]Get down here.
[125:16.88]Alright, fuck off.
[125:18.22]I'm not doing it.
[125:19.28]Let's go.
[125:22.46]He's too stupid.
[125:24.10]His brain can't figure out to walk over here.
[125:29.68]Yeah, bye.
[125:37.49]Is this like human bones down here?
[125:39.09]This just turned into a horror game.
[125:43.99]What is in here?
[125:44.55]Is that open?
[125:56.99]I've got somebody's shoe.
[125:58.45]I'm going to have to keep that.
[126:00.55]And I'm also going to take somebody's leg bone as a weapon.
[126:02.51]Alright, that works.
[126:07.65]I want to see if I can slap this open.
[126:09.85]This looks like a care package or something.
[126:12.93]Whatever.
[126:13.27]This is just getting in the fucking way.
[126:19.72]Get the hell out of here.
[126:23.30]Taking out the bone.
[126:24.84]Oh no, I don't have the bone.
[126:25.96]I have the shoe.
[126:28.53]I'm gonna be like an old grandmother and just start whacking.
[126:31.01]Or I'll be stuck in the wall.
[126:36.71]I actually am stuck in the wall.
[126:39.11]Interesting.
[126:39.55]I don't want to lose the shoe though.
[126:41.34]Alright, I got the shoe.
[126:48.00]Spin my wrist around so my hand's not broken.
[126:56.38]There's no way I can not have a broken wrist.
[126:59.58]By the way, this just kind of looks like my foot is in the air.
[127:03.78]Doesn't that look like I'm just holding my leg up?
[127:09.27]Get the gun!
[127:10.87]What gun?
[127:11.87]Wait, what?
[127:14.63]Was I too busy being stuck in a fucking wall that I couldn't see the gun?
[127:21.31]Where's their gun?
[127:28.58]Where the hell do you guys see a gun?
[127:32.38]On the roof?
[127:37.12]Oh, this gun.
[127:39.22]The little PP7.
[127:39.93]There's an SMG near the bones.
[127:44.45]Is there?
[127:44.81]No, there's not.
[127:50.75]Get this fucking shoe out of here.
[127:52.37]Like, seriously.
[127:57.44]Can I open up the door of the car?
[127:59.30]No.
[128:03.62]Whatever.
[128:07.60]I don't see... Guys, I don't see anything.
[128:11.04]I did get this thing, though.
[128:12.58]So that's good.
[128:15.98]There's a bazooka in the T-Rex.
[128:18.28]Now you're just joshing me.
[128:22.04]Shoot box.
[128:22.82]Good idea.
[128:24.26]That might actually work.
[128:29.41]No.
[128:30.11]That didn't work.
[128:31.53]Just wasted ammo.
[128:37.71]Oh, man.
[128:38.49]They didn't think this part through.
[128:41.85]They didn't think this, like, wedgie-ass particle shit through.
[128:46.07]Wait, what's that up there?
[128:48.27]Am I gonna get jump-scared?
[128:50.63]Maybe.
[128:54.94]More bones?
[129:06.61]And somehow he's not dead.
[129:09.41]Somehow he's not dead.
[129:12.77]Somehow he's still alive.
[129:14.88]And they're his friends.
[129:18.16]Don't ask me how, I shot him like four fucking times.
[129:22.40]And now I don't get anything.
[129:24.50]And now there's three of them.
[129:27.80]despite what we've been led to believe the t-rex was not a scavenger I'm stuck here oh my god I'm stuck in this stupid oh my goodness gracious
[130:01.14]Oh my, fuck me.
[130:06.16]Didn't say, like, dude, this place sucks.
[130:09.73]Steven Spielberg, like, forgot to smooth out the ground so you get stuck in it every fucking ten seconds.
[130:17.71]Look at this.
[130:18.55]Somebody forgot to come in and use, like, the blend tool.
[130:21.81]Because you get stuck on these.
[130:39.15]Press E to open the box.
[130:41.53]Press E on box.
[130:42.59]It doesn't do anything.
[130:54.85]Guys, it doesn't do anything.
[130:56.08]It's just a shitty prop.
[131:01.33]And despite what you may believe, the T-Rex was not a scavenger at all.
[131:06.45]We clocked one at 50 kilometers an hour.
[131:12.92]Feed the box of the T-Rex.
[131:18.78]No, don't get stuck here.
[131:19.90]I get stuck there every time.
[131:21.22]And despite what you may believe, the T-Rex can run very, very fast like a cheetah.
[131:30.82]Isn't that interesting?
[131:32.34]Fuck you.
[131:42.87]Stupid-ass dinosaur.
[131:43.95]Get out of my life.
[131:52.31]Son of a... Son of a gun.
[132:09.72]Don't get stuck.
[132:11.04]Don't get stuck, just run by them.
[132:14.06]That noise is so terrifying and loud.
[132:16.11]Despite what we've been led to believe, the T-Rex was not a scavenger.
[132:25.03]We clocked one at 50 kilometers an hour.
[132:27.96]What is going through the ground here?
[132:29.30]Nice one.
[132:42.63]Please jump down here Please jump down here.
[132:54.24]I did it on purpose.
[132:55.08]I want I want one of them to jump down here and die You know one of them might come over here and die It's right there don't worry
[133:14.02]I'm stuck.
[133:17.74]I did do it on purpose.
[133:18.54]You think I would take fall damage three times like that in a row?
[133:23.62]No.
[133:26.08]You know, despite what you guys believe... Shit, he's still behind me.
[133:30.51]Alright, he's too dumb to follow me down here, I think.
[133:41.77]Yeah, he is.
[133:42.41]His AI won't let him do it, I don't think.
[133:45.11]We'll find out when we go down a little further.
[133:46.71]Are you smart enough?
[133:50.68]No, you're not.
[133:51.24]Okay, we're good.
[133:57.18]Remember Dark Souls 2?
[133:58.36]Look at this terrain.
[134:00.50]This is just awful.
[134:03.01]This is fucking Castle Griffinstein level of spider web video game.
[134:12.30]This is just, this is just something.
[134:14.48]Oh my god.
[134:20.99]Can I?
[134:25.43]God, that was horrible.
[134:26.61]Alright, we're going up even higher.
[134:30.05]A lot of bad guys that way.
[134:35.68]I don't want to go over there.
[134:40.94]Save, go to, yeah.
[134:43.08]Good call.
[134:52.15]Uh.
[134:55.07]Alright, I guess we just keep going.
[134:58.92]You tell me I gotta get up this awkward, jagged mountain?
[135:02.12]I'm not sure I can do this.
[135:06.48]Can I do this?
[135:09.18]Huh?
[135:09.58]Why are you playing this music right now?
[135:13.39]Why are you playing this really loud music?
[135:15.43]What's going on?
[135:21.99]Last time this happened and I'm stuck.
[135:26.15]What is going on?
[135:34.34]Okay.
[135:37.54]How am I supposed to get down here?
[135:51.12]Was it because I saw the propeller?
[135:52.18]Was that supposed to scare me?
[135:56.38]Oh no.
[135:56.82]A helicopter.
[135:59.68]Oh no.
[135:59.94]A helicopter crashed here.
[136:06.23]Honest to fucking god.
[136:07.19]Please.
[136:07.59]It's half gone.
[136:27.84]Hasn't been used.
[136:30.50]Hasn't been used.
[136:32.75]Don't... I don't... He's not gonna come after me.
[136:37.07]Just go.
[136:37.53]Get the fuck out of here.
[136:41.41]God, please.
[136:42.55]You fucker.
[136:43.23]What?
[136:43.35]Oh.
[136:47.60]No, I don't want to go back this way.
[136:49.14]I want to go over here.
[136:49.92]Oh my god.
[136:51.34]This terrain.
[136:53.04]This terrain.
[136:54.58]Steven Spielberg.
[136:57.04]You sincerely fucked this one up.
[137:00.54]The game's fun, but like... What's with this awful terrain, man?
[137:11.73]Save it.
[137:17.85]These VR controls are so bad, I know.
[137:21.49]When do I get to drive a car?
[137:24.82]You know?
[137:28.64]I'm looking for the vehicle combat, because that's gonna be fun.
[137:32.04]When does that happen?
[137:36.54]Have my phone remind me every five minutes to save?
[137:38.82]It's actually, like, not a terrible idea.
[137:43.42]I have to be getting close to the facility, right?
[137:48.37]Was it AK into the helicopter?
[137:49.75]Was it really?
[137:50.15]I just missed it.
[138:05.84]There is no facility.
[138:09.40]There has to be.
[138:10.94]Oh yeah?
[138:11.34]There's no facility?
[138:12.07]Well, when I look in the back of the box, I see a facility.
[138:17.19]I see a little indoor area.
[138:18.37]I see an indoor facility area.
[138:19.63]I think that guy was chasing me the whole time.
[138:30.78]Uh, this way?
[138:32.64]I guess?
[138:38.93]I guess we're going over here.
[138:59.38]I had to do it.
[139:05.26]I just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[139:09.26]I wanted to see if I, like, bounced.
[139:10.42]I wanted to see if I bounced.
[139:13.47]That's it.
[139:20.33]There is a box over there.
[139:21.15]You're right.
[139:27.70]Where am I going?
[139:31.91]I don't think I'm going the right way.
[139:33.35]Something's not right here.
[139:35.17]Maybe the back where the big tree trunk is?
[139:40.96]There is no health meter.
[139:41.96]There is no HUD.
[139:54.41]Um... Yeah, I kind of... Don't drop that.
[139:58.73]Full clip.
[140:08.38]I don't understand.
[140:08.92]I mean, like, logically I would, like, decide to do this, right?
[140:18.35]I guess.
[140:20.23]But what does this even do for me?
[140:23.73]The health meter is your boob tattoo?
[140:25.21]Oh.
[140:27.17]Okay.
[140:30.03]Where on earth am I going?
[140:31.17]Really?
[140:34.89]Really?
[140:41.37]Come on, play something for me.
[140:44.74]Play like a clip for me so I can know if I'm going the right way.
[140:46.88]What do you mean he fell for it?
[140:54.30]What are you talking about?
[140:55.24]Where am I?
[141:00.52]Where the fuck am I supposed to be going right now?
[141:07.68]I am back where they stopped developing the level.
[141:13.72]Look at this.
[141:16.42]They didn't even care to clean up back here.
[141:21.02]It's just a mess.
[141:27.43]Well, let's see what's up here.
[141:34.61]Come on, get up there.
[141:36.22]Shit.
[141:39.72]I don't think I can get up that.
[141:42.88]Nope.
[141:44.18]Oh well.
[141:47.26]Oh, it's so close!
[141:50.92]It looks like... I think I am up there, but I think there's an invisible wall.
[141:57.16]Yeah.
[141:58.88]Invisible wall.
[141:59.86]What?
[142:01.36]A little bit over here.
[142:12.37]I need to find civilization.
[142:21.20]Wrong way.
[142:22.50]I mean, what was the right way?
[142:25.14]Didn't seem like there was a right way.
[142:29.42]Get on Google Maps.
[142:31.72]I know, really.
[142:32.22]Alright.
[142:35.64]Well, I don't know.
[142:41.10]This looks like the right way.
[142:42.15]No, it looks like the wrong way.
[142:47.43]How's my health?
[142:49.39]It's full.
[143:01.55]I really wish the movement speed was increased by like 500 million percent, by the way.
[143:07.09]How far back do I need to go?
[143:08.16]I don't know.
[143:11.28]I'm just gonna reload.
[143:12.32]Just load.
[143:12.78]Load when I was like in the right spot.
[143:17.72]So like I could go that way or like which way?
[143:23.92]I don't know.
[143:24.30]I'm so turned around.
[143:25.00]This is why I want like a fucking compass or something.
[143:28.69]All this whole entire area looks the same.
[143:33.67]Like, where was I even supposed to be going?
[143:41.01]I was going the right way.
[143:42.91]What?
[143:45.17]What?
[143:47.42]How are you?
[143:47.76]That's what I was thinking.
[143:48.48]Like, cross the tree, but it didn't look like I was even supposed to go over there.
[143:51.04]Because I went over there.
[143:58.18]F1 for help.
[143:58.96]Yeah, F1 just says, I gotta keep going.
[144:07.51]Don't... Don't break your arm.
[144:09.49]Alright, I mean, like, I can go... Like, this way?
[144:19.02]Should I, like, just... No, that's not the right way.
[144:21.02]Okay, I thought that was just a truck backing up.
[144:28.39]I'm just gonna go over here.
[144:36.77]I don't know.
[144:39.64]Alright, well there's a... I don't know how you got up here.
[144:44.82]Don't ask me.
[144:45.30]This is not safe for you.
[144:57.06]He's gonna fuck this up, isn't he?
[144:58.36]Just waiting for you to ruin this whole thing for me.
[145:08.70]Don't.
[145:09.38]Don't even come up here.
[145:10.38]He's gonna get up on the tree.
[145:14.08]Ugh.
[145:21.29]He's alive.
[145:23.13]He lived through that.
[145:27.01]Yeah, he's alive.
[145:27.87]He's okay.
[145:29.23]Don't worry about him, guys.
[145:33.75]Over there?
[145:38.74]How did he even get over here?
[145:39.82]That's what I want to know.
[145:41.46]I guess I'm going to go this way.
[145:47.78]Can't see my boobs are in the way.
[145:57.92]Yeah, gotta go up the rocks.
[146:00.75]What the fuck is this level design?
[146:05.75]What is this level design, really?
[146:07.65]Like do I have to climb?
[146:08.97]There's no way I have to go up here.
[146:15.00]This is like somebody made like Dark Souls.
[146:18.34]But didn't connect anything.
[146:23.88]What?
[146:24.96]There's no way I'm supposed to climb this.
[146:29.40]There's no fucking way.
[146:32.92]I'm not supposed to go up here, guys.
[146:38.46]I don't see how this is a possibility.
[146:51.48]What the fuck?
[146:55.44]Read chat?
[146:56.46]I'm reading chat!
[146:59.20]I don't know where you guys are telling me to even go.
[147:03.96]There's no indication of where the fuck anybody's supposed to be going in this game.
[147:07.74]There's just shit everywhere.
[147:15.25]If I do have to go this way, then this is fucking moronic.
[147:28.38]I don't have to actually go up here, do I?
[147:30.44]This is the sloppiest piece of shit if this is the real way to go.
[147:35.15]It can't be.
[147:38.27]Everyone keeps telling me to hit F1.
[147:39.69]This is what happens when I hit F1.
[147:42.53]Jungle.
[147:43.25]Keep going until I find civilization.
[147:44.87]I can do this.
[147:59.38]Illusory.
[148:00.14]I'm doing the right thing?
[148:01.40]No way.
[148:03.59]no fucking way am I doing the right thing just keep going what this is not I guarantee you I'm gonna get to this and it's gonna be you guys are just fucking with me and I wasn't going to go over here see look look at this this is just the end of the world it's like a minecraft chunk I'm gonna look down it's gonna be a bunch of shit I'm gonna see like diamonds that I can't get to
[148:36.52]No, no, I'm sliding.
[148:37.88]I'm sliding, I'm sliding, I'm sliding.
[148:39.15]I can't stop.
[148:40.09]I'm sliding right now.
[148:41.25]I'm holding W. If I don't hold W, I'm gonna slide.
[148:45.31]No, this is not the right way.
[148:49.63]I'm sliding off.
[148:50.41]I can't go forward.
[148:51.33]Thank God.
[148:52.27]Save.
[148:56.64]This is not the right way, guys.
[148:59.30]How would this be the right way?
[149:11.75]Are you serious?
[149:13.79]This was the right way the whole time?
[149:18.19]It's the right way.
[149:22.84]Wow.
[149:23.52]That's fucking unbelievable.
[149:28.62]That's truly unbelievable, actually.
[149:31.78]Why would they make you go up that?
[149:34.18]That looked like the bad, developed part of the world.
[149:36.86]Alright, hold on.
[149:38.06]Wait, wait.
[149:38.30]We got important shit going on.
[149:48.36]Can't wait to use this fucking thing.
[149:50.16]Can't wait.
[149:50.76]Did I get him?
[149:59.60]I can't tell.
[150:02.67]And now I just pissed off the, like, bearded T-Rex.
[150:06.71]No, sorry.
[150:07.15]I just pissed off the bad guy from Gremlins.
[150:09.79]One of the bad Gremlins just got angry with me.
[150:22.91]There's no reason for this to be in the game.
[150:26.54]This shit is so bad.
[150:27.78]I don't think you guys understand how impossible this is.
[150:35.38]There's no way to turn this.
[150:37.10]This really is worse than a VR game for controls.
[150:53.90]Fucking kidding me.
[151:01.54]Okay, I can get him right there.
[151:03.18]Right there.
[151:03.70]There's no way.
[151:13.21]Nearly empty.
[151:14.41]Nearly empty.
[151:15.63]Oh, well.
[151:18.39]Almost gone.
[151:22.79]That's it.
[151:23.63]Good.
[151:24.50]Good for you.
[151:25.42]Nice job.
[151:26.32]Full clip.
[151:27.80]Cool.
[151:31.29]Full clip.
[151:33.71]Well, can we drive it?
[151:35.39]Oh, cool.
[151:36.53]Give me that.
[151:36.97]I'll use this now.
[151:39.39]And that T-Rex has a very, very, very bad leg.
[151:42.41]I can't drive the car, unfortunately.
[151:46.20]But I will unload this clip on this guy.
[151:49.00]Because he's almost dead.
[151:49.78]And I'll get the kill.
[151:51.16]But first I gotta get rid of you.
[151:55.14]Okay, now you.
[152:00.28]Got him.
[152:03.53]Game over, I win.
[152:06.35]Gremlins 2 can be over.
[152:10.97]That was so anticlimactic.
[152:15.56]I can't drive because there's no wheels?
[152:16.86]Yeah, well, what are you doing?
[152:20.30]Okay, for a second I thought his hands weren't supposed to be up there.
[152:24.68]Ayayay.
[152:28.20]Left or right?
[152:29.34]Um... Let's check what's in here and then go right.
[152:33.12]Yeah, the stream's over.
[152:35.06]We can successfully end the stream.
[152:38.35]I beat the T-Rex.
[152:43.73]Anything in here?
[152:44.31]Of course there is.
[152:45.07]It's an Uzi.
[152:45.69]And there's a sledgehammer too.
[152:46.73]And there's another T-Rex.
[152:47.51]That's not a T-Rex.
[152:53.84]I mean, we have to take the sledgehammer.
[153:08.04]First maybe useful melee weapon.
[153:19.59]Nice.
[153:20.67]Sledgehammer.
[153:25.20]I'm going to bash somebody's head in with this thing.
[153:27.24]Okay, restore that.
[153:33.04]And we're going to take the... Yeah, I don't want this.
[153:35.92]Give me the other one.
[153:39.28]Okay.
[153:39.77]Um, I guess... I'm gonna take a little pee break here, guys.
[153:45.45]I have to pee.
[153:47.37]Pee break.
[153:48.43]I'll be right back.
[153:50.79]Take this opportunity to go refill your drink.
[153:52.64]Go take a piss.
[153:53.34]I'll be back in, like, five minutes.
[155:43.00]Okay.
[155:44.66]Let's keep going.
[155:45.42]There we are.
[155:52.49]Let's make it back over.
[155:53.67]Thank you for your patience.
[155:56.69]Thank you for your patience.
[156:01.62]So, I guess we're going this way.
[156:03.74]What is that?
[156:15.72]Okay.
[156:16.70]Nice.
[156:17.96]Keep that for later.
[156:19.64]Okay.
[156:33.77]Let's go.
[156:36.49]Sometimes you just gotta reach out and grab it, right?
[156:38.25]Sometimes you just gotta reach out and touch it.
[156:43.30]I do want to fix this so my wrist is in the right spot.
[156:46.46]Like this.
[156:49.00]That's not the right spot.
[156:50.26]But, you know.
[156:52.46]I don't care.
[157:02.81]There we go.
[157:04.95]There we are.
[157:08.21]Please, ghost.
[157:09.59]Broken down truck.
[157:11.52]Alright, I want to try to get a melee kill.
[157:20.21]Am I ever going to do a 24 hour stream?
[157:22.21]Definitely not.
[157:31.24]Alright, so, as you guys can see, don't ever use a melee weapon.
[157:39.87]Melee weapons are completely useless.
[157:43.09]They don't do anything.
[157:45.23]It's just, when you use a melee weapon, it says, hey, please kill me as fast as you can.
[157:56.06]True melee combat.
[157:57.12]Yeah, I know.
[157:59.92]Let's throw it at him and he won't do anything.
[158:01.48]That's fine.
[158:01.86]What was the point?
[158:06.63]Okay, I don't even want to shoot this guy because I don't think there was even a point of coming over here.
[158:10.69]Nothing in the... God.
[158:13.42]Nothing in the truck.
[158:14.12]Nothing inside the truck, right?
[158:18.46]What else?
[158:18.90]Nothing over here?
[158:20.14]So there's no reason to come over here.
[158:26.26]No.
[158:26.36]Okay.
[158:26.90]So we're going to go the other way.
[158:35.61]Feels full.
[158:37.46]It's the attitude that's bringing you down.
[158:39.30]What do you mean, the attitude?
[158:40.40]What attitude?
[158:40.88]I have an attitude.
[158:51.43]That dinosaur has not loaded his AI in.
[158:55.62]These two dinosaurs down here are having an AI loading issue.
[158:58.90]We're going to go see what the problem is.
[159:02.50]I'm going to see if we can solve it.
[159:03.60]There we are.
[159:07.27]Hey, we're okay now.
[159:11.71]Oh my god.
[159:12.29]He blew a fuse in his brain.
[159:40.77]Can you seriously just please just fall down and do the thing that you do when you die?
[159:48.36]Please follow the power lines.
[159:50.10]That's what I'm doing.
[159:50.62]There you go.
[159:51.10]Somebody put a brain from a worm inside a dinosaur.
[160:10.32]Just unload?
[160:11.18]No, you can't reload the gun.
[160:14.44]You only get like 10, 12 shots at each gun.
[160:16.71]It sucks.
[160:21.45]Nothing.
[160:24.73]Whole lot of nothing.
[160:34.18]Why is the road so fucked up?
[160:35.72]What is that?
[160:38.58]Oh god, that's like an airplane.
[160:41.53]For a second, I thought it was GLaDOS.
[160:44.13]Yeah, I made a reference to, like, fucking GLaDOS.
[160:47.15]I know.
[160:48.48]I know.
[160:50.56]I'm sorry that I just did that.
[160:52.06]I'm sorry.
[160:52.34]You were here to hear that.
[161:06.25]Lots of guns on that plane.
[161:07.97]Let's check out this first.
[161:11.76]Haha, cake lie.
[161:13.08]Hahaha.
[161:15.10]I know.
[161:16.26]I was trying not to make it.
[161:17.98]My body just kind of had to do it.
[161:21.65]Cool.
[161:24.11]That was fun.
[161:24.75]Oh, really?
[161:24.99]It hasn't been used.
[161:25.47]Good.
[161:25.57]I'll use it.
[161:25.91]Hey, remember this joke?
[161:44.91]Alright, let's go to the plane.
[161:47.83]It scared my cat.
[161:50.53]It scared your cat.
[161:56.51]That is actually really funny.
[161:58.63]That's very funny.
[162:03.15]VR joke?
[162:03.69]We already did the VR joke.
[162:13.52]Please just go up the fucking side.
[162:17.13]Oh, this fucking Spielberg.
[162:20.33]Go back to E.T.
[162:23.97]Yeah, where's the E.T.
[162:24.95]game?
[162:26.55]What happened to that one, Steven?
[162:28.72]Mr. fucking Spielberg.
[162:29.84]Yeah, landfill.
[162:31.38]That's what I thought.
[162:32.00]Ugh.
[162:47.26]I need to get over there.
[162:49.33]Did that just say my birthday?
[162:50.73]Did that just say that they released the first Raptor in September of 1985?
[162:54.67]That didn't just say that, right?
[162:56.39]Am I crazy?
[162:56.71]It feels about half.
[163:20.63]Oh my god, I just want to get up there.
[163:28.03]Yes, I was the fire.
[163:29.21]What's today?
[163:29.95]Is today April 22nd?
[163:30.51]Yeah.
[163:30.95]No, April 22nd.
[163:31.57]Happy birthday.
[163:32.19]Yeah, my birthday was like last week.
[163:33.79]No, I can't even get up that.
[163:48.65]By 1987, the first of them had reached full size.
[163:52.84]The ecosystem of another era began to reassert itself.
[163:56.36]Ugh, this is so annoying that I can't just walk up here.
[164:00.23]Finally, now let's go to the airplane.
[164:19.34]I wish that would actually do damage.
[164:21.58]Because I don't think it does.
[164:22.60]Save.
[164:24.46]New save, just in case I can't win.
[164:31.02]Okay.
[164:35.29]Why'd they make the raptors first?
[164:36.33]I don't know.
[164:39.63]Maybe because they're the easiest to let loose?
[164:42.63]Maybe?
[164:46.30]What?
[164:46.56]What are you on?
[164:48.75]Huh?
[164:50.17]Why am I doing so much yawning?
[164:54.28]There's definitely some stuff in the plane.
[164:56.34]Why wouldn't there be?
[164:57.00]I can tell because the loud-ass music just started playing.
[165:10.71]Well.
[165:13.33]That's pretty good.
[165:18.58]That guy's ribcage.
[165:19.50]Okay.
[165:22.18]That was so disrespectful.
[165:25.26]I'm so sorry.
[165:25.88]I need to give this guy like a proper burial now.
[165:29.22]Let me give you a proper burial, dude.
[165:36.50]What's this?
[165:44.69]I lost his head.
[165:45.77]Whatever.
[165:46.09]Fuck this guy.
[165:57.95]The dinosaurs have anti-aircraft technology?
[166:00.43]Alright, well, let's just keep following the power lines.
[166:10.54]Who leaves a ribcage on a plane?
[166:11.92]Me.
[166:15.52]At least I have one of the good guns, though.
[166:17.04]I hope this lasts.
[166:20.19]I really don't want to use it on this piece of shit enemy, but, you know, let's just see, like, how... I fucking hate that.
[166:25.53]I hate when that happens.
[166:31.10]That is the loudest gun in the game.
[166:33.26]By far.
[166:34.48]So, sorry guys.
[166:35.68]Sorry your ears are about to explode.
[166:37.02]Holy shit, that is awful.
[166:50.75]This thing better have like 5,000 bullets.
[166:58.88]Not really, like a base-boosted gun.
[167:00.14]This thing is just insanely loud.
[167:04.88]What's at the end of this, I wonder?
[167:07.52]Hopefully it's the indoor part of the game.
[167:15.25]Yeah, I gotta say, I'm getting kind of sick of the... Getting kind of sick of the random raptors that are on the green path.
[167:29.48]I want to go inside and see the other NPCs.
[167:35.70]There's another person in the game.
[167:36.84]There has to be another NPC.
[167:38.06]There was two people that said was in the game.
[167:40.47]David Attenborough and Minnie Driver.
[167:43.29]So where's David Attenborough's character?
[167:44.71]Oh, he's the narrator.
[167:45.49]No, he's not.
[167:46.75]Wait, David Attenborough's... Is there just me in the game?
[168:03.26]I think it's just me and this other guy.
[168:04.92]I thought David Attenborough had, like, a different voice than this.
[168:15.29]That's not David Attenborough.
[168:16.53]He's the guy that... He's the one that talks like this about the ants.
[168:20.03]The ants have their brains consumed by wild mushrooms.
[168:23.95]Oh my god.
[168:24.83]Fuck off.
[168:26.63]And he took it out of my hand.
[168:27.71]I fucking swear to god that is what...
[168:30.67]And when the mind-controlled mushrooms take over the ants, something miraculous happens.
[168:37.57]You guys have seen that.
[168:41.33]Dan Aykroyd.
[168:42.03]All right, new level.
[168:46.03]This has got to be it.
[168:49.48]Coffee.
[168:52.12]Shower is coffee.
[168:53.94]Air conditioning.
[168:56.32]That's what you guys are looking for.
[168:57.42]I know it.
[168:58.12]I'm certain of it.
[169:01.66]There's your joke.
[169:03.82]Ow.
[169:08.30]Everyone was waiting for that.
[169:14.48]German, no.
[169:15.46]Please stop dropping the gun, you awkward fucking asshole.
[169:19.84]Ugh, just put it away.
[169:20.58]You climbed the dumb thing.
[169:26.98]How am I supposed to go up the giant catapult?
[169:32.53]Yeah, I'm trying to figure this out too, man.
[169:37.89]What?
[169:39.93]Oh, you stopped.
[169:47.48]Okay, let's go.
[169:50.04]On to the next level!
[169:52.68]Here we go.
[169:53.52]Look it, we finally made it to the city.
[169:59.72]This is what I wanted to see.
[170:11.02]Here we go.
[170:14.02]I see a church.
[170:15.66]I see a fire department.
[170:17.28]This is going to be cool.
[170:20.66]Look at how much stuff.
[170:21.33]This is going to take a long time to load.
[170:22.59]There's going to be a lot of assets in this world.
[170:24.43]Guarantee it.
[170:31.89]Maybe we can finally put a face to the voice.
[170:33.71]Uh-oh.
[170:44.14]Uh-oh.
[170:51.58]Uh-oh.
[170:55.77]It's so close.
[170:58.25]It's so close.
[170:59.25]Come on.
[170:59.87]This is what we came here for.
[171:01.09]This is why we came here.
[171:08.76]There's a lot of stuff in this church.
[171:10.86]We're gonna go in there and there's gonna be like 30 dinosaurs.
[171:17.47]Ah, okay.
[171:18.35]It just, the disk stopped spinning.
[171:24.80]Shit.
[171:31.87]Oh, well.
[171:35.57]Hmm.
[171:43.76]Uh, it actually did crash.
[171:45.64]It did crash.
[171:46.52]So, give me a second here.
[171:52.61]My name is John Parker Hammond.
[171:59.45]Alright, what did I end up?
[172:06.09]Fuck.
[172:06.71]This is so far away.
[172:12.90]This is actually really fucking far away.
[172:16.10]Well, it's alright.
[172:16.84]We'll have a good discussion.
[172:18.54]Let's have a good discussion about something.
[172:20.34]What's in the news lately?
[172:28.74]Get this thing out of the fucking way.
[172:31.70]I guess I could go through some bits.
[172:32.72]Hold on.
[172:33.06]Let me make sure I didn't miss anybody.
[172:36.81]Hey, Captain No-Beard.
[172:37.99]Thank you, Captain No-Beard, for the five dollars.
[172:39.35]Appreciate that.
[172:41.47]And you say?
[172:42.73]Spielberg was actually very involved in the development of this game.
[172:48.89]Well, that's cool.
[172:53.32]In the jungle, the forest, and the mountain, three raptor tribes... Didn't say... Well, it's okay.
[172:58.82]I'm not that... ...and seven T-Rex chose their dominions.
[173:05.11]How do I like my eggs?
[173:06.07]Over easy.
[173:07.63]Either over easy or scrambled.
[173:10.66]None of the sunny side up bullshit.
[173:14.00]None of the sunny side up bullshit.
[173:15.98]I don't like a runny egg.
[173:17.88]Runny egg is gross.
[173:19.24]Means it's not cooked all the way.
[173:21.28]Right?
[173:21.48]Runny egg means it ain't cooked.
[173:22.72]Ow!
[173:35.73]I got an over easy with a firm center.
[173:41.40]Over easy, firm center.
[173:45.64]And that's the bottom line.
[173:54.71]What's your perfect Sunday?
[173:55.93]I don't know.
[173:59.64]You know, chilling back with a couple of drinks with the girl, you know, you know how it is.
[174:13.17]All right, please don't fuck up.
[174:22.40]Save it right here, just in case.
[174:26.11]Alright, don't give it any time to think.
[174:27.35]Just go.
[174:27.67]Don't give it any time to think.
[174:29.02]Don't give it any time.
[174:29.56]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[174:31.80]Load.
[174:33.14]Come on.
[174:33.70]It got further than last time.
[174:35.60]Yes.
[174:36.41]Yes.
[174:36.77]Okay, good.
[174:39.69]Now we're in the city.
[174:42.03]Any guns immediately?
[174:43.07]No.
[174:47.95]This is a shitty linear Fallout with the dinosaurs.
[174:51.45]Uh, well, no, I'm gonna stop you there.
[174:53.71]This is... Do you see how I'm shooting the gun?
[174:56.93]This is a shitty VR game that doesn't have VR.
[175:00.16]This is a shitty non-VR game.
[175:01.70]This is a door.
[175:04.16]Can I just open the fucking door?
[175:08.30]Yeah.
[175:09.28]I guess I can.
[175:09.78]There's a phone in here.
[175:14.52]No, get it open.
[175:16.30]Security system.
[175:17.14]Phone.
[175:18.26]Looks like that's still active.
[175:24.10]What's the... I'm not gonna be able to do this if I try.
[175:27.52]B19L1E.
[175:30.14]Okay, B... No, fucking... Okay.
[175:46.56]B?
[175:50.83]1, 9?
[175:51.09]Or is that L?
[175:55.11]Oh my god.
[176:00.19]B?
[176:00.71]1, 9.
[176:01.41]Or is that G?
[176:06.31]Oh my fucking god, no!
[176:14.20]This is not possible to do.
[176:18.13]Okay.
[176:20.71]Is it 13?
[176:20.91]Is that 1, 3, 1, 9, L?
[176:23.32]I don't fucking know.
[176:24.18]B?
[176:31.84]B?
[176:32.14]1.
[176:33.68]Oh my god!
[176:46.89]Get me in this fucking door.
[176:56.15]Three, one, seven, six, one, three, one?
[176:58.59]No, I'm gonna do what I did first, but it's like, honest to fucking God.
[177:12.21]Is that all letters?
[177:14.45]Big lie.
[177:16.43]That's what it says, it says big lie.
[177:19.21]I know how you get a door open, you do it the old fashioned way.
[177:31.61]B. Holy shit, guys.
[177:45.40]This actually is, like, not possible.
[177:51.48]You know how I have to do this?
[177:52.63]I have to do this, like, operation.
[177:55.03]I have to play operation.
[177:57.70]B. People saying two, four, four.
[178:16.92]Two, four, four, five, four, three.
[178:19.21]How the fuck am I gonna get to the five?
[178:21.43]How am I gonna get to the five without hitting four again?
[178:27.17]God damn it!
[178:27.87]2, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3.
[178:28.55]2... 2... 4... 4... 5, 4... 3.
[178:30.53]That's not right, guys.
[178:32.15]That ain't right.
[178:35.27]3, 1, 7, 6, 1, 8.
[179:10.20]Okay, you know when you're like shit-faced?
[179:19.14]If you were like shit-faced trying to figure out your home security code.
[179:24.63]This is what you would do.
[179:25.51]This is like you have one eye closed leaning in with one eye open.
[179:29.89]No!
[179:39.64]He's like, oh, what's my room number again?
[179:41.98]Like, leaning in with a fucking, I don't know.
[179:45.13]What the fuck was it?
[179:45.95]317618. 3...
[180:11.51]One.
[180:14.79]Seven.
[180:17.61]Six.
[180:19.13]One.
[180:24.39]Eight.
[180:25.63]Oh, fuck.
[180:26.09]How do I get the eight?
[180:27.31]Oh, no.
[180:28.15]I don't want to hit the zero.
[180:32.51]I got it!
[180:35.19]Get the fuck open.
[180:36.39]And give me a gun.
[180:37.96]Eight shots.
[180:40.17]Get me the hell out of here.
[180:41.05]Dr. Wu!
[180:42.25]Can I get in here?
[180:43.35]Come on, here are the new NPCs.
[181:06.66]Why is this playing the Kindom... This is just Kingdom Hearts.
[181:10.49]Remember when you, like, picked what Keyblade and what you do with your friends, right?
[181:13.43]It's like, oh, what kind of person are you?
[181:16.59]Are you somebody that protects your friends?
[181:18.03]Or are you somebody that just dives in solo?
[181:20.40]That was the music.
[181:21.00]And now I can't move.
[181:21.74]I'm stuck in here.
[181:52.37]No.
[181:54.99]Eight shots.
[182:24.66]Un-fucking-believable.
[182:28.04]Un-fucking-believable.
[182:32.77]Unbelievable.
[182:46.72]I'm trying so desperately to just end it.
[182:50.34]Three.
[182:54.46]Two.
[182:56.66]One.
[182:58.96]One shot left.
[183:00.43]Last chance.
[183:02.67]God damn it!
[183:06.05]Where even am I?
[183:06.81]No!
[183:34.73]318, 317, 138 or something.
[183:36.70]Wait a second, what?
[183:44.14]Hold on.
[183:45.52]What is this?
[183:49.34]It's because I didn't high-five Mei Ling.
[183:52.89]That's true, I didn't.
[183:56.87]You're telling me I could jump over this the whole time?
[183:58.43]Really?
[184:00.41]Really?
[184:04.23]I can just make a jump here.
[184:07.87]Okay.
[184:08.17]Alright.
[184:12.08]That's fine, I'll go in the tube.
[184:18.96]Um... That's fantastic.
[184:25.86]Here I come, see?
[184:29.10]I have to choose what, uh... Listen.
[184:35.26]Right now it's telling me about the Heartless.
[184:49.23]I've realized something about this game.
[184:51.51]Once you get out of their, like, LOD range... What the hell was that noise?
[184:56.32]Did you just hear that eagle?
[184:57.70]I just heard a fucking bald eagle swing by me.
[185:00.66]I don't think I can get in here.
[185:01.86]It's unfortunate.
[185:18.19]How can I not get in the bus?
[185:23.71]Don't be safe, let him suffer.
[185:26.55]That's not nice.
[185:30.50]Somebody didn't make it to the house.
[185:32.32]Somebody fucked up their house.
[185:36.26]Now you guys, you can make the Fallout joke now.
[185:38.13]This is like the Fallout 4 settlements.
[185:41.03]You know why it looks like the Fallout 4 settlements?
[185:44.51]Because that feature was fucking stupid and nobody used it, so nobody did any buildings.
[185:49.92]Just like my Fallout set up, right guys?
[185:53.34]You know, because that feature was fucking stupid and nobody used it, you know what I'm saying?
[186:04.42]Hey, there's a soda machine.
[186:10.96]What the hell?
[186:11.42]It ate my dollar!
[186:13.21]It ain't my dollar!
[186:13.81]I wanted a Mr. Pip!
[186:16.05]That was a $100 joke right there.
[186:17.87]You guys just didn't even see it.
[186:22.79]The fuck am I supposed to be doing here?
[186:24.99]I guess the operation center.
[186:25.99]I need a phone.
[186:27.35]Okay.
[186:27.59]We're gonna go into the saloon.
[186:28.59]Okay.
[186:38.92]Uh...
[186:45.18]How did I even get it?
[186:45.91]This is the men's bathroom.
[186:51.37]Where are you supposed to go?
[186:52.25]You're supposed to piss on the floor?
[186:53.55]Is this giving somebody... Is this hurting everybody?
[186:57.75]I can't even be in here.
[186:58.41]This is actually giving me claustrophobia.
[187:02.76]Another good bathroom that's been utilized.
[187:04.74]I'm going to throw up being in these rooms.
[187:06.02]I'm not kidding.
[187:13.92]This is actually making me sick.
[187:18.90]No, I gotta get out of here.
[187:20.34]I actually have to get the fuck out of here.
[187:21.96]I would throw up if I stay in here any longer.
[187:23.28]I'm not kidding.
[187:25.50]Give me the bath.
[187:26.81]I gotta get the fuck out of this room.
[187:28.29]I'm serious.
[187:28.79]I'm about to throw up.
[187:29.33]I'm not kidding.
[187:32.39]I am being as dead serious as I can.
[187:36.07]Oh.
[187:37.89]Oh my god, that hurt.
[187:47.99]Oh man, I actually do feel sick right now.
[187:49.93]I feel actually sick.
[187:51.25]What the fuck?
[187:54.49]Why am I going back up here?
[187:58.90]My fucking stupid baseball bat.
[188:02.74]Just blocked me from jumping up there.
[188:06.40]I don't even care.
[188:07.32]Just get me to the phone.
[188:08.50]I'm sick right now.
[188:14.50]If I walk in this room, I'm gonna get sick.
[188:16.58]I'm gonna fucking puke if I go in here.
[188:20.32]What was that?
[188:27.48]The biotechnicians were compensated for living in exile.
[188:32.21]High pay, luxury housing.
[188:34.33]Guy, get me off.
[188:35.81]Dennis wanted computer time and money.
[188:39.01]Henry wanted his state of the art entertainments.
[188:41.39]These were the elite.
[188:43.56]who could have gone anywhere to work hard to keep them here.
[188:46.42]It's like a Twilight Zone episode where he's in this town with no people and the guy's really an astronaut.
[188:52.33]Finally a toilet.
[188:59.11]I made it.
[189:06.04]I made it!
[189:08.52]Oh no!
[189:09.94]No, not another puke room.
[189:15.52]I don't know where to go.
[189:24.25]This way?
[189:26.73]Do I have any weapons?
[189:36.27]Shit.
[189:37.71]Oh, not another fucking puke room.
[189:40.15]What is this?
[189:40.61]I'm in the bathroom.
[189:42.27]No, don't go in there.
[189:43.19]Oh, there's a soda can machine.
[189:49.30]Oh.
[189:53.94]I'm just gonna make it up there.
[189:55.74]Fuck this guy, I don't care.
[190:00.43]Just gotta get up here and then I finally can make it to Jurassic Park.
[190:07.35]Who thinks this is funny?
[190:10.57]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:14.71]Open the door.
[190:15.49]Get in.
[190:15.77]Get in the facility.
[190:16.63]I made it.
[190:16.95]Thank God.
[190:17.21]Public notice.
[190:17.57]Mountain shop for data transfer.
[190:18.49]I don't care.
[190:18.87]No, this...
[190:33.03]All these fucking rooms are the same goddamn funhouse puke rooms.
[190:37.93]Oh!
[190:39.11]Animal control.
[190:40.95]What the fuck is in here?
[190:41.83]Oh, look, it's another throw-up room.
[190:44.73]It hasn't been used.
[190:45.61]Animal control.
[190:46.35]There's machine guns in here.
[190:56.38]Radio room, right?
[190:57.86]That's where I need to go.
[190:58.60]Just get in here and...
[191:06.63]That's it, I'm dead.
[191:09.06]Apparently.
[191:09.44]Listen, I can't get into the security room.
[191:13.00]Come on, I'd like to hack it, right?
[191:14.60]Just hack it.
[191:16.24]Hack it or something.
[191:16.98]Fuck me.
[191:24.59]What do I do?
[191:26.29]Maybe a phone.
[191:37.46]Give me a second here.
[191:40.60]Really?
[191:41.45]Like, shut up, dog.
[191:43.59]Shut up, dog.
[191:59.40]Eh, not a big deal.
[192:00.10]Just some animal control.
[192:04.28]I need to get to a phone.
[192:09.83]Broken.
[192:11.51]No radio, no phone, no satellite.
[192:15.67]That's it, I'm dead.
[192:24.29]Six rounds.
[192:27.81]Phone.
[192:29.34]I really am.
[192:30.02]Like, something about that pushed me over the edge, guys.
[192:33.62]And I, like, don't feel well.
[192:36.92]I might have to, like, end the stream.
[192:41.73]If there ain't a fucking phone in this dumb shitty diner.
[192:44.13]It's just bathrooms.
[192:48.91]That door wasn't even a door.
[192:50.99]That door wasn't even a door.
[192:52.22]That wasn't even a fucking door.
[192:54.16]Somebody got lazy.
[192:56.34]Come on, there's gotta be a phone in the back of the diner.
[193:00.22]Why is he talking?
[193:00.98]That's not a door either.
[193:02.96]That wasn't a door either.
[193:06.93]Dude, who ever paid this contractor?

[198:52.52]I'll stop at the stop sign.
[198:53.76]Look both ways.
[198:56.86]Tiles are cracking, smeared with windblown dirt and animal tracks.
[199:01.56]Thick tree roots are pushing up through the asphalt.
[199:04.39]I don't want to fuck around now.
[199:05.33]This is the worst time for me to mess around.
[199:07.07]It'll cause too many problems for myself.
[199:09.07]Beginning to erase all trace of us.
[199:14.44]This idiot just walking around with a keycard in his hand.

[199:21.81]So loud.
[199:23.33]Okay, now what?

[199:45.39]Are they all on?
[199:46.21]Okay, they're all on.
[199:56.86]I don't know.
[199:59.87]I think I did it.
[200:00.57]I did it, right?
[200:01.89]Gate A. Please tell me.
[200:07.17]Okay.
[200:07.69]That's fine.
[200:08.69]Whatever.
[200:08.97]I don't even know what that does.
[200:14.14]That's not the right way.
[200:14.84]Fuck.
[200:16.78]Wait, what do you mean that's not the right way?
[200:18.04]There it is.
[200:18.48]Where's my... I gotta lean back in the chair.
[200:21.08]I don't care where the gun is.
[200:24.14]I can't read the clipboard.
[200:25.00]It's too much.
[200:26.36]I'm about to throw up.
[200:32.27]Get Cameron's front door keycard back from Woo.
[200:36.53]And... John Hammond All, North Gate, West Gate.
[200:51.27]I'm not, I'm not kidding.
[200:52.45]This is seriously causing me problems.
[200:55.55]Alright, just go back to Dr. Wu.
[201:00.35]Fight it.
[201:00.75]Why am I so pukey?
[201:01.47]Because when I walk in these internal rooms,
[201:19.50]When I go inside, that same texture, that off-white on every single wall, the rooms are so little.
[201:27.12]Okay, well, there's a gun.
[201:34.53]Do I have a gun, though?
[201:36.91]I have two guns.
[201:39.39]Six left.
[201:40.55]Six left.
[201:40.95]Got it.
[201:47.76]Alright, we're going to see if I can go into Dr. Wu.
[201:50.06]And then we're going to see where we're at.
[201:53.11]And then I might need to go check my brain.
[201:56.77]I'm going to have to go plug something into my head and see what my level is.
[202:00.41]Okay, Dr. Wu is all the way back here.
[202:04.51]Dr. Wu's gate.
[202:05.89]I'm going to get surrounded by these stupid things.
[202:14.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[202:21.42]not doing anything.
[202:23.16]Did anybody figure out what happened with this monster?
[202:31.36]I killed him apparently so well that he stopped moving.
[202:34.90]How was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[202:36.72]He's not dead.
[202:42.47]This just turns them into statues.
[202:44.05]What is this doing?
[202:47.71]What the fuck is happening with these people?
[202:50.80]He's still alive.
[202:51.52]Uh... Are these tranquilizer guns?
[203:04.58]Yeah, these have to be tranquilizer guns.
[203:16.95]It really is a freeze gun.
[203:18.39]Yeah.
[203:19.59]Well, now I get my revenge.
[203:23.67]You are gonna take one of these.
[203:26.34]Oh, what's the matter?
[203:28.82]Oh, somebody... Ooh.
[203:31.90]Somebody can't do anything about this, can they?
[203:33.86]You little dick.
[203:46.43]I love how that's just kind of mildly irritating him.
[204:03.95]Radio phone camera the string Okay, bye I want to fucking kill him with this so bad.
[204:23.20]Oh god.
[204:23.58]He's got my hand.
[204:24.56]He's got my hand.
[204:25.14]Oh
[204:33.07]You guys think this is going to be like that?
[204:36.23]When I get back here?
[204:38.17]Alright, that's Dr. Wu's gate.
[204:44.27]Hold on, this is important.
[204:49.21]Can I kill him with a basketball?
[204:52.67]Right.
[204:55.23]If killing him is possible with a basketball, I want to be able to do it.
[205:04.99]The basketball's gone.
[205:12.98]I'm just, like, using this as a sponge and cleaning it.
[205:20.39]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[205:26.19]What?!
[205:28.03]Hey, hold on!
[205:35.27]Was he just pretending?
[205:37.59]That one was just pretending.
[205:39.07]He didn't actually... Oh, my God.
[205:48.72]No, no.
[205:49.66]Where am I?
[205:50.22]Where is that save?
[205:51.34]I don't even know.
[205:52.00]Ugh.
[206:04.95]Oh no.
[206:07.70]I don't want to have to do this shit again.
[206:40.94]I want to catch this in midair.
[206:41.84]Alright, if I catch this in midair, then I'll keep playing, okay?
[206:55.38]Oh!
[206:56.42]That was so satisfying.
[206:59.18]You guys have any idea how fucking satisfying that was?
[207:01.14]Alright, I'll do it one more time.
[207:13.98]I love how somebody in the chat just wrote, God damn it.
[207:18.28]Somebody just wrote, God damn it.
[207:19.98]They didn't want to see this anymore.
[207:30.58]If you do it again, I have to stream Spore for seven years.
[207:37.68]Alright, we're going to do this and we're actually going to get out of here.
[207:40.40]We're going to get to Dr. Wu's place.
[207:45.34]And once we get out of it, then we'll move on.
[207:48.02]But we're going to get to Dr. Who's first.
[207:52.59]Once that happens, then I'm going to take off.
[207:58.67]It's so loud.
[207:59.61]All right, we go beep boop bop, beep beep beep beep beep beep.
[208:02.13]Beep boop bop.
[208:03.51]Boop.
[208:04.52]Beep boop beep beep beep.
[208:05.66]Okay, there we go.
[208:09.84]Give me that key card too.
[208:10.56]I don't know if I'm going to need it again.
[208:13.80]Alright, let's go.
[208:14.66]Forget about the stupid dinosaurs and move.
[208:23.71]Wait, I got them all.
[208:24.45]I got them all.
[208:26.35]What do you mean A?
[208:29.33]A. What do you mean A?
[208:30.03]What?
[208:30.15]What?
[208:30.29]What?
[208:30.55]What?
[208:30.75]What?

[208:31.21]What?
[208:31.37]What?
[208:31.53]What?
[208:35.98]I didn't press A?
[208:36.36]What do you mean press A?
[208:42.99]Press A, you baboon.
[208:44.53]What?
[208:46.21]I didn't press them all?
[208:49.43]No.
[208:52.89]I pressed it, right?
[208:57.85]How long do I have to hold this for?
[209:03.26]OK.
[209:12.66]Grab an AK?
[209:13.30]No, I don't want an AK.
[209:17.26]No, I can't be in there anymore.
[209:18.48]Okay, yeah, I will.
[209:23.08]It was, uh, like, pest control, right?
[209:25.25]Yeah.
[209:30.37]Ugh.
[209:37.51]Alright.
[209:38.49]Just go into Doctor Wu and see where we end up, and then I'm gonna be done.
[209:44.88]This is starting to actually hurt my... Best pest control?
[209:47.74]Best pest control?
[209:49.14]Save.
[209:49.56]I will!
[209:49.84]I need to get one of the slowdown guns though.
[210:11.44]Do I need that?
[210:11.96]I don't think I need that anymore.
[210:14.12]No, I want one of the slowdowns.
[210:15.18]I want one of the time guns.
[210:16.45]Get out of here.
[210:21.69]It's important to have one of these.
[210:33.20]My brain has slowed down.
[210:36.72]After I feel like I'm gonna puke, I need to just sit still and be like, I don't say any words.
[210:43.67]I have no words to say.
[210:48.83]I need to try something.
[210:53.37]Okay, he's gonna stand still, right?
[210:59.72]That one fell.
[211:01.73]Okay, I want to get them all over here.
[211:03.23]Save it.
[211:04.91]Not doing that again.
[211:08.63]Okay, get them all over here.
[211:10.53]We're going to try something.
[211:12.69]Come on.
[211:20.09]Come on!
[211:24.72]Ah!
[211:25.18]Wow!
[211:25.58]Why did you come out so quick?
[211:26.54]Why did you come out so quick?
[211:29.23]What?
[211:31.86]What the fuck?
[211:39.22]That's why I saved it.
[211:40.18]You know what?
[211:42.76]Fuck this guy.
[211:51.89]Fuck you.
[211:54.43]Bullshit.
[212:10.09]Why do some of you take so much longer than others?
[212:11.94]Alright.
[212:15.48]So, it was over here.
[212:16.80]This is where Dr. Wu was, right?
[212:22.70]Why is she saying this again?
[212:28.04]I wanna see you guys flip the fuck out when I get this first try.
[212:39.62]I tried.
[212:46.21]Dude, the three stooges slap?
[212:48.65]What do you mean?
[212:51.69]That was in.
[212:54.45]We could have gone in.
[212:57.47]So here's the gate.
[212:58.29]Where's gate A?
[212:59.93]This is not even the right gate.
[213:04.61]I need some, like, red keycard?
[213:07.45]What is this nonsense?
[213:09.73]What is this?
[213:12.49]I don't like this.
[213:13.99]This backtrack, walk around in circles bullshit.
[213:16.23]I don't know if I like this very much, guys.
[213:22.67]Oh, no.
[213:29.71]Oh!
[213:38.72]Over here?
[213:47.05]Different keys?
[213:47.75]I don't know.
[213:48.05]What is this different key nonsense?
[213:51.25]Can I get into this?
[213:54.31]I can.
[213:54.60]Okay, I can get in here.
[213:58.44]Five shots.
[214:04.92]Alright, this, this, I, we're going in a new house.
[214:07.54]I don't like going in new places.
[214:10.68]Alright, we're gonna leave.
[214:11.78]We're gonna leave this outside.
[214:13.04]Okay, that phone don't work.
[214:15.68]Uh...
[214:38.14]Nice pool.
[214:38.70]Alright, well, there's a red keycard here.
[214:44.38]It's gonna be, like, in his bathtub.
[214:46.60]No, it's not.
[214:47.88]Ugh.
[214:49.82]Gotta lean back.
[214:50.82]Where is this red keycard?
[214:56.43]Red keycard.
[214:57.19]Your house is so bad!
[215:04.91]I've seen better houses made in Minecraft than your house, Dr. Wu.
[215:11.64]This is a Minecraft house.
[215:23.23]Anything in there?
[215:28.35]No.
[215:34.17]Get the keycard and get me the fuck out of here.
[215:41.57]God.
[215:42.89]Go.
[215:44.19]Anything?
[215:44.75]Who cares if there's anything in here?
[215:47.47]I don't care.
[215:47.99]Open the door.
[215:48.59]It's half gone.
[215:49.47]I don't... Ah!
[216:00.37]Just leave it.
[216:00.91]Leave it.
[216:01.41]I don't care.
[216:01.85]Leave it.
[216:03.34]Leave it.
[216:04.56]Oh, my God.
[216:05.36]I almost puked.
[216:12.42]I'm giving this, like, five more minutes.
[216:15.67]Thank you, Foxysauro, for the 15 bucks.
[216:17.15]You're a champion, MLG Gamer.

[216:35.58]When I came to London, I had neither fortune or education.
[216:38.78]All right, there better be something in here.
[216:39.78]No connections.
[216:41.48]Nothing.
[216:42.14]This is the end of the game, right?
[216:43.22]This door doesn't open.
[216:50.76]I can't open this door.
[216:51.54]It's half gone.
[216:59.50]Okay, I'm done.

[218:54.65]All right, where do I go?
[219:01.94]I don't know where to go.
[219:03.98]We're going to go up.
[219:10.58]It's a creepy bed.
[219:11.56]There's no mattress in here.
[219:18.72]I slept on a dirty wooden frame.
[219:22.87]It was better for my back.
[219:26.29]I also kept a loaded snub-nosed handgun.
[219:30.47]Just sitting out in the open.
[219:32.92]Which was really fucked up because I had a bunch of people that lived with me and who knows who could have found that and used it.
[219:39.50]I just kept it sitting out in the open next to the bed.
[219:45.43]My research...
[219:48.04]My research is more important to you than you are important to me.
[219:52.37]I knew that was... You know what?
[219:55.71]I fucking knew that was going to happen before I saved it.
[219:59.81]How do I... I don't want to go back down the stairs.
[220:01.45]How do I do this without dying?
[220:08.00]Like that.
[220:08.96]Perfect.
[220:11.62]Just fucking slime down the side.
[220:13.54]Get me out of here.
[220:16.45]I have the diskette.
[220:20.04]Do I still have it?
[220:20.82]No.
[220:21.14]I dropped it.
[220:24.88]Where is it?
[220:25.28]I fucking like panini pressed my... My hand and it's gone.
[220:43.26]There.
[220:43.54]Give me the fucking... It's right there.
[220:51.34]I'm hungry.
[220:59.61]Stop dropping it!
[221:03.65]I want to be able to see it at all times, so I know I don't drop it.
[221:08.21]Where do I go?
[221:10.76]What do I do with the disc?
[221:28.08]What if I go now?
[221:28.64]Does anybody have any idea?
[221:32.34]In the office?
[221:38.84]What are you talking about, lady?
[221:55.45]I want diet soda, juice boxes, and cartoons.
[222:01.31]That's what you miss the most?
[222:03.93]Not, let's say, your family members?
[222:07.12]Or your friends?
[222:09.72]What's the number one thing you miss, Mini Driver?
[222:12.46]Eh.
[222:13.86]Cartoons.
[222:15.88]You don't, like, miss your fucking husband?
[222:19.38]Or your dog?
[222:20.55]Dog?
[222:25.61]I'm going the wrong way, probably.
[222:33.86]Is it possible to kill yourself?
[222:35.76]We actually have tried like 25 times.
[222:38.90]It seems like it's possible, but it's very improbable.
[222:55.46]Copy machines?
[222:57.22]Copy machines?
[222:59.75]Who misses copy machines?
[223:03.15]Damn man, I really wish I could get off this dinosaur island.
[223:05.85]I really miss making copies at the fucking fax store.
[223:12.77]Where the fuck am I going?
[223:22.06]I just heard a bunch of noise.
[223:23.08]And there he is.
[223:25.02]Get out of here.
[223:32.21]I'm walking in circles.
[223:33.33]I know.
[223:33.73]I know.
[223:35.41]Wait a minute.
[223:36.07]Computer?
[223:37.59]Computer?
[223:38.17]Is there a computer in here for me to stuff this in?
[223:40.02]Is there a desktop computer?
[223:42.34]Computer?
[223:44.28]No.
[223:44.78]It's just a puke room.
[223:46.66]It's another vomit room, guys.
[223:47.98]There's nothing else in here.
[223:50.48]Three shots.
[223:56.67]Nope, puke room two.
[224:03.35]Stupid.
[224:07.68]Floppy disk is for the mansion.
[224:09.26]Don't even fucking tell me that.
[224:13.20]Don't tell me that shit.
[224:14.42]Is that for real?
[224:17.48]Do I actually have to go back to the mansion?
[224:18.90]Because if I have to go back to the mansion, I'm going to reload the area.
[224:22.68]Is it in the mansion?
[224:23.58]It is?
[224:24.40]Okay.
[224:39.81]Pick it up, you fucking idiot.
[224:45.87]Just a hole here to his kitchen.
[224:49.81]Bunch of broken stairwells.
[224:54.29]A dirty bathroom.
[224:55.56]That didn't go in.
[225:07.79]I didn't go in.
[225:09.43]I can't get in.
[225:13.01]There's no fucking computer in here.
[225:14.87]And I lost the disk.
[225:16.89]I don't see it.
[225:25.58]Six left.
[225:29.24]Get me down.
[225:29.78]Against the wall, my whole body shook.
[225:36.37]Alright, I'm gonna take... I'm out.
[225:37.63]I'm out.
[225:40.15]We might pick this up another day.
[225:43.07]Backyard Q... My brain can't handle any more of this after about four hours.
[225:53.06]The floppy disk has the highest quality texture.
[225:58.79]We'll pick it up from here.
[226:04.27]I'm so close.
[226:09.14]You played this game for four hours.
[226:10.62]Yeah, I did.
[226:11.44]It was too entertaining.
[226:12.64]I had to.
[226:17.90]It's not difficult.
[226:18.84]I think you're just bad.
[226:21.71]Well, I think when items are just scattered around in somebody's backyard, I have to walk around in circles looking for them.
[226:31.05]Also, the game controls like
[226:35.71]The game controls as if somebody put their hands on my neck and squeezed as hard as they could while I was wearing a bucket on my head.
[226:45.20]That's how it feels to control the game.
[226:48.10]I like it.
[226:48.90]I actually do like it.
[226:49.64]I do like the game.
[226:59.94]Oh, and somebody's like blowing snots in my mouth.
[227:03.81]Why would that be a thing?
[227:04.57]I don't know.
[227:09.94]I saved it, right?
[227:10.88]Yeah, I did.
[227:13.50]Oh, alright.
[227:14.14]Before we go, though... Let me do... Hold on.
[227:16.64]Let me make sure... That's saved.
[227:18.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[227:21.52]Oh, game sucks?
[227:22.16]No, no, no.
[227:23.16]That was like... That was fun.
[227:27.26]I just like... After a while, this game is seriously... Especially when we started going indoors, it was making me feel sick.
[227:35.78]But... Thank you, everybody!
[227:39.85]for watching.
[227:40.57]This game was a lot of fun.
[227:42.13]I feel like there were some fun, uh... fun moments.
[227:46.71]Fighting the monsters was fun.
[227:47.91]I'm calling them monsters for some reason.
[227:49.39]I don't know why.
[227:49.73]I'm just, like, tired.
[227:51.05]It's very unique.
[227:53.42]It was cool.
[227:54.02]I like it.
[227:55.26]Anywho, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[227:57.30]We will pick up, uh... We're gonna start with a different game tomorrow.
[228:01.72]Another dinosaur-themed game.
[228:05.08]And depending on how that goes, we... There's, like, two or three dinosaur options.
[228:10.96]As we continue Dinosaur Week.
[228:16.62]And... Yeah.
[228:19.68]Wrong clip.
[228:21.96]Wait.
[228:24.60]I am tired.
[228:27.23]Stream over.
[228:27.81]Not like starting soon.
[228:29.21]Good night, guys.
[228:33.09]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[228:34.85]See you guys tomorrow, same time.
[228:37.55]But I do want to say thanks to...
[228:43.32]Made that shot first try.
[228:44.84]Thank you, everybody.
[228:46.84]Thanks to all the new subs, all the old subs, everybody that gave some bits.
[228:51.48]We're going to start with a new game tomorrow, but we might come back.
[228:54.44]Good night.
[228:54.82]Good luck.
[228:55.66]See you guys tomorrow.
[228:56.48]Much love.
[228:57.24]Bye-bye.
[229:42.47]you
