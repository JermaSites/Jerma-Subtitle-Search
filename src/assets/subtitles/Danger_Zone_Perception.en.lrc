[04:53.86]Now what?
[04:55.26]Thanks for the million dollars.
[05:01.14]This is Burnout 3, but worse.
[05:03.58]Taxicab?
[05:04.14]Your taxicab ain't worth 60 grand!
[05:07.96]You're trying to tell me that a taxi cab is... The Kelly Blue Book value of a taxi cab is not more than a Chevy Cruze.
[05:15.24]I'm sorry.
[05:18.50]Let's go.
[05:20.72]Training simulation complete.
[05:22.86]That's the whole training, by the way.
[05:25.30]I know how to play the game now.
[05:27.00]Hmm.
[05:27.87]Okay.

[05:34.77]Oh, there better not be.
[05:38.57]Wait, do I have to frogger this?
[05:42.35]I'm gonna lap my ass off if I have to frogger one of these levels.
[05:46.97]Easy, I know.
[05:47.39]Just get in a car accident.
[05:48.32]I get it.
[05:50.12]Hit the target number of vehicles to earn a Smash Breaker.
[05:52.48]Use Smash Breaker to increase score by blasting nearby vehicles.
[05:55.54]Use the explosion to move your car around and wreck more havoc.
[06:02.25]Alright.
[06:04.67]How do I Smash Breaker?
[06:17.28]Why does my car explode?
[06:24.47]Okay Cool so it's a left click This is burnout meets Tony Hawk.
[06:34.84]This is just guys.
[06:35.68]This is just the tutorial Way more shit going on here
[06:43.82]How do I do, like, a... Oh, whatever.
[06:46.02]Let's just go.
[06:46.46]Let's get through this.
[06:49.34]Alright, so you can do the smash breaker.
[06:50.72]There's only two more tutorials.
[06:52.10]There's not much else to learn.
[06:56.40]Watch, this is gonna be like... Oh, it's gonna be power-ups.
[06:59.54]Of course it is.
[07:00.02]There's one of them's money.
[07:04.14]So I have to avoid the cars.
[07:06.25]Okay, I get it.
[07:11.39]Collect metal pickups for score bonuses.
[07:12.91]Collect all bronze and silver to... Oh, man.
[07:16.82]So you... I have to drive... It's not about crashing cars.
[07:24.54]Okay, hold on.
[07:26.72]So I have to avoid the cars.
[07:29.22]I thought this was supposed to be like crashing the car game.
[07:33.72]Alright, so it's going to pick up the coins.
[07:36.88]Don't get in any car accidents.
[07:38.52]I can do that.
[07:41.20]Or, like, can I do that?
[07:49.93]They got it in an accident.
[07:50.87]I didn't have to get in one.
[07:56.97]What the fuck?
[08:00.52]Oh, I forgot to get the last gold coin.
[08:02.28]Oh, well.
[08:06.10]I get it.
[08:06.46]You pick up the bronze ones, you get the silver ones, you get the gold ones.
[08:13.68]There's one more thing to learn, and then we're done.
[08:19.71]De-resolution.
[08:22.17]You're going to put school buses in here now?
[08:23.97]Come on.
[08:31.12]We've removed the safe zones around the intersection.
[08:33.58]Push other vehicles off the edge of the road for a knock-off score bonus.
[08:36.42]If you fall off the road, it's game over.
[08:37.72]Okay.
[08:41.62]Can I move the camera at all?
[08:44.38]Doesn't look like it.
[08:47.76]Just gotta get the money.
[08:49.72]Don't crash!
[08:50.48]It like told me not to do what I'm doing.
[08:54.13]I can't even reverse.
[09:03.81]Why can't I reverse the car?
[09:05.13]This is rear-wheel drive!
[09:09.23]I'm stuck here.
[09:11.87]When am I gonna get my showstopper?
[09:19.07]I failed the fucking tutorial.
[09:24.89]How do I turn the car- How do I- Good.
[09:31.65]We're fine.
[09:32.93]We're good.
[09:36.61]Almost made it.
[09:41.74]Alright.
[09:42.40]No, this car seriously drives like shit!
[09:47.75]Oh my god!
[09:51.25]Turning the wheels is impossible.
[09:54.71]Don't ever turn the wheels.
[09:57.47]Ever.
[09:58.93]Trust me when I say that.
[10:01.10]I need to slow it down.
[10:02.44]This is like oil all over the ground.
[10:04.92]Which one of you fucking Mario Kart assholes dropped the oil slick?
[10:11.02]We gotta avoid those.
[10:13.22]Pick up the cash.
[10:16.08]There is no reverse, by the way.
[10:17.92]There literally is not a reverse in the car.
[10:20.30]That's fine.
[10:22.02]Thanks for the shitty car that has no reverse.
[10:30.22]Now it's time for a showstopper!
[10:31.56]Alright, I understand.
[10:39.60]I know, I get it.
[10:44.85]There's the tutorial.
[10:47.38]Don't have to get the pickups.
[10:48.24]That's fine.
[10:48.76]Now let's let training simulation complete.
[10:51.71]There's another one, I think.
[10:55.79]No, this is just the first one.
[10:56.85]Okay, we're good.
[10:59.85]Yeah, let's just crash everything.
[11:01.27]Yeah, I get you.
[11:02.65]Wait a minute.
[11:02.99]No, this is different.
[11:05.21]I skipped that too.
[11:06.20]It wants me to go off the jump.
[11:12.78]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[11:16.41]GO TO THE SCHOOL BUSES!
[11:17.31]Jesus Christ.
[11:30.66]There wouldn't be THIS many- Why do I still have- Why am I still up with a blowup?
[11:41.47]Alright, I win.
[11:48.50]Alright, cool.
[11:53.20]This is like burnout?
[11:54.07]Yeah.
[11:55.13]Oh, wait.
[11:55.51]I think this actually was the first level.
[11:58.15]Was it?
[11:58.43]I think I got the gold medal.
[12:03.03]Yeah, cool.
[12:05.03]Hey, take a look at that.
[12:07.83]350th in the world, guys.
[12:12.63]Come on.
[12:13.67]Give me something.
[12:14.17]Let's keep doing it.
[12:22.16]Impact protection.
[12:23.08]Now, what do you want me to do?
[12:30.98]You already did.
[12:31.82]Please ensure safety belts are securely fastened.
[12:34.10]Okay.
[12:34.94]I gotta get 7 million.
[12:35.74]Who's the best in the world?
[12:37.39]This guy with 16 million.
[12:38.45]You got it.
[12:38.79]Let's see if I can do this.
[12:45.79]Alright, we're gonna go straight up and then... Nope.
[12:52.27]I almost just got in a tiny fender bender with that guy.
[12:59.18]Showstopper!
[13:04.30]Get it?
[13:04.56]Where are the other cars?
[13:14.71]Come on, get over there!
[13:19.99]There we go.
[13:22.40]What I need?
[13:23.02]7 million?
[13:24.48]How close am I?
[13:26.04]Like halfway there.
[13:30.19]Is this the whole game?
[13:31.25]I don't know.
[13:33.89]Guys, I don't know.
[13:34.97]We've been live for 13 minutes.
[13:37.85]And I think we've seen the entire game.
[13:39.43]I don't know.
[13:44.21]Maybe we have.
[13:45.67]Let's see.
[13:50.67]Next?
[13:51.07]No!
[13:52.03]We're not doing next.
[13:53.93]Look at this.
[13:54.27]Look at this mini golf course that we're on now.
[14:03.03]See?
[14:03.39]Hot wire.
[14:03.85]You may suddenly encounter intense heat.
[14:05.39]Smash breaker.
[14:09.45]It's just burnout.
[14:10.17]We have to get to at least somewhere halfway through.
[14:15.22]They didn't expect me to go this way.
[14:19.80]Off the jump.
[14:25.00]And... Get it.
[14:26.10]God damn it.
[14:29.98]It's okay.
[14:30.36]We're okay.
[14:34.33]Just turn this way.
[14:40.17]Come on.
[14:40.69]Get over there.
[14:41.91]Roll over there.
[14:42.67]Come on.
[14:43.17]You can do it.
[14:43.65]I want to do that again.
[14:46.89]No, I'm doing it again.
[14:50.36]Just play Cars 2, the game.
[14:58.06]I didn't realize it was gonna be right here.
[15:05.59]Hey, you guys voted for Danger Zone!
[15:12.53]Really?
[15:15.11]Come on.
[15:16.27]Come on!
[15:19.04]Somebody else get in an accident!
[15:21.66]Somebody else do something, please.
[15:25.38]Where's the one fucking idiot that's gonna drive right into this?
[15:28.06]Oh my god.
[15:30.52]I did no such thing.
[15:40.89]You picked this.
[15:43.95]This was voted for like a hundred and sixty times.
[15:52.45]Come on, go look at the thumbnails.
[15:53.57]This looked like a fun game, didn't it?
[15:56.25]Didn't this look like a fun game?
[15:58.97]It is fun.
[16:01.33]Just gotta wedge yourself in there.
[16:06.16]I don't know how it's possible that these all didn't explode.
[16:13.40]This could have been a sniper ghost warrior.
[16:15.68]It still could be a sniper... Guys, that still could be a sniper ghost warrior stream.
[16:24.70]It is kind of addicting, though.
[16:26.17]I'm not gonna lie.
[16:26.79]Alright, I'm gonna thread the needle here.
[16:33.17]Right?
[16:36.74]Come on, come on!
[16:38.00]There it is!
[16:40.66]Why did I... I just got, like, so fake excited about that.
[16:46.84]Come on, hit me!
[16:49.81]Oh, like, there it is!
[16:51.80]That wasn't even fun.
[16:53.10]I just pretended it was fun.
[16:59.82]Come on, come on, keep it going.
[17:02.21]Just three million more dollars.
[17:03.81]It's okay, I think we still won.
[17:14.15]Yeah, we got it.
[17:17.51]The truth comes out.
[17:20.91]I didn't even make it?
[17:22.47]How did I not make it?
[17:26.83]I didn't even look at it.
[17:28.56]Alright, we're not doing the jump anymore.
[17:35.18]I need to cause way more problems.
[17:36.78]I need to get way more of those gold jewels.
[17:40.30]And a couple of these crash boxes.
[17:41.66]God fucking damn it.
[17:49.32]Alright, launch me all the way over there.
[17:50.74]Come on.
[17:51.50]And then let me do it to the... Come on!
[17:53.70]I need like 5 million, right?
[17:57.00]Nice, there it is.
[17:58.60]I did not need close to 5 million.
[18:04.20]That guy's just on a fucking camping trip.
[18:07.08]No, it's okay, I'm fine.
[18:11.58]My favorite part about games like this is the fact that like... Random people just drive straight...
[18:20.90]Just play Burnout Paradise.
[18:28.82]I'm still 315th in the world.
[18:31.32]How much is it to win?
[18:36.19]Six million.
[18:37.01]Holy shit.
[18:38.25]Really?
[18:39.95]God.
[18:45.45]I'm not sure what to do about this.
[18:47.41]I mean, you have to go off the jump.
[18:50.20]Just not, like, super fast.
[18:51.40]Let's slow it down.
[18:56.79]If you guys had any idea how fucking... How bad that is.
[19:00.69]Even hitting the brakes.
[19:01.87]That was not intended.
[19:08.92]I'm not gonna go... Fireballs in the rear view.
[19:11.08]What the hell was that?
[19:11.62]What does that say?
[19:14.59]We're gonna grandma this.
[19:15.61]We're gonna go off the fucking jump grandma style.
[19:18.55]I'm not gonna fucking run.
[19:20.10]I can't be going that fast.
[19:23.32]What is that like this fast?
[19:26.30]It's not gonna do it.
[19:27.64]It's okay.
[19:29.46]We got a break here.
[19:30.27]God fucking damn it.
[19:36.67]I just got pulled over.
[19:48.22]Hey, I got a combo breaker.
[19:57.92]Must we get it?
[19:59.18]I would laugh my ass off if I actually got it.
[20:03.20]No.
[20:04.30]I'm actually, guys, I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kind of addicted to this.
[20:09.67]I'm actually having fun right now.
[20:15.64]This is not a non-enjoyable experience for me.
[20:19.46]I'm liking this more than the Surge.
[20:21.59]I mean, that says something, right?
[20:24.77]Alright, that's definitely fast enough.
[20:27.87]Oh, you fuck!
[20:29.76]Alright, don't get hit by the magic school bus!
[20:31.44]Wait, wait, wait!
[20:34.92]I got my smash breaker.
[20:47.17]God damn it!
[20:51.31]How long can you keep this up?
[20:52.63]I'm trying to figure out how to do this.
[20:56.73]That tells me you have bad taste.
[21:00.21]No it doesn't.
[21:04.71]I did not have any fun.
[21:06.31]I didn't do that!
[21:07.77]I swear to fucking god!
[21:09.77]The car just started like... Oh my god, I'm so angered right now.
[21:14.13]I'm having fun.
[21:15.33]We're having fun in this room.
[21:17.54]Don't try to tell me I'm not having fun.
[21:22.60]I think it's like the mouse.
[21:23.83]When the mouse moves.
[21:27.31]How much longer?
[21:27.87]You know what?
[21:28.33]Fuck it.
[21:28.75]I'm gonna stream this for like an hour.
[21:31.19]Everybody like hates this shit so much.
[21:33.23]See?
[21:33.47]Alright, just get the money.
[21:37.21]Weaving in a traffic.
[21:42.98]This is... There we go.
[21:44.12]I got two of these now.
[21:47.36]That has to be it, right?
[21:48.38]Times 12.
[21:48.72]Give me the other one.
[21:51.70]Come on.
[21:52.86]Nice.
[21:53.24]Come on, come on, come on.
[21:54.06]Somebody go over here.
[21:54.60]Get over here.
[21:54.92]Get it, get it, get it.
[21:59.76]Come on.
[22:00.80]Times 13.
[22:01.66]Get it.
[22:02.00]Did I still not do it?
[22:09.07]This guy is driving so slow.
[22:11.13]Did I not do it?
[22:13.73]He's just going to drive into it right now.
[22:23.53]I didn't do it.
[22:28.18]Does anybody understand what I'm doing wrong here?
[22:30.26]I just did so many things.
[22:35.04]Six million for bronze.
[22:43.52]I don't understand.
[22:45.08]I guess you have to go over the jump?
[22:47.10]You have to.
[22:49.00]There's no other way to do this.
[22:50.98]And then somehow I have to get all this money.
[22:53.38]I guess.
[22:55.48]No, I made it.
[22:55.92]Okay.
[22:59.10]There was a crash.
[22:59.96]I wasn't a part of that crash.
[23:01.06]We're good.
[23:03.17]Just get the money.
[23:04.15]Get triple combo breakers.
[23:06.71]Good.
[23:07.23]Get the other one.
[23:09.17]These people are literally doing this on their own.
[23:11.17]That's fine.
[23:11.73]Get them all.
[23:12.95]And then smash breaker number one.
[23:17.61]Give me that big gold one.
[23:22.46]2.5 million.
[23:26.12]And you tell me I didn't do it.
[23:29.40]How is this possible?
[23:30.24]I've destroyed every car and I picked up all the money.
[23:34.14]How did I not do this?
[23:36.04]How have I still not beaten?
[23:37.48]It's less than the last time.
[23:44.14]How is it less than the last one?
[23:46.82]I got all the money.
[23:47.70]And somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[23:54.86]Thank you, Warfan, for the $50.
[23:58.48]Protip always tried to crash into some of the first cars.
[24:01.14]Stop trying to be cute.
[24:02.40]Well, I'm not trying to be cute.
[24:05.80]Also, I've been watching your streams on YouTube for ages and finally decided to wade into the filth.
[24:10.87]Jesus.
[24:12.11]Can't wait for your big videos this year.
[24:13.95]Keep doing what you do.
[24:15.49]Smiley face.
[24:16.15]Well, thank you for the $50, Warfan.
[24:19.01]Appreciate it.
[24:19.83]I'm not trying to be cute.
[24:20.71]I thought, what do you mean crash?
[24:22.61]I win?
[24:24.15]I won.
[24:26.70]Pretty cute fucking streamer, if you ask me.
[24:32.72]Alright, listen.
[24:33.18]No need for median, so we just jump the median.
[24:36.51]Okay.
[24:40.07]Burnout probably costs less and would be more enjoyable.
[24:44.76]I mean... I'm kind of having fun, though.
[24:49.22]That's the thing.
[24:49.72]I don't hate this.
[24:53.86]Obviously, we're gonna go off the big jump.
[24:55.74]That's the bait, right?
[24:56.58]That's why we're not supposed to go off this one.
[25:02.02]Whatever we are.
[25:08.79]I didn't even do anything over there, and there was already an accident.
[25:15.41]What's the minimum I need?
[25:19.87]Come on, push me.
[25:25.63]Refund for Burnout 3.
[25:31.26]I don't think I won.
[25:31.92]3.5.
[25:36.96]That's not going to cut it.
[25:45.11]You guys don't... Do you think I'm pretending to have fun?
[25:47.09]No, I'm having fun.
[25:49.07]This is a fun game.
[25:53.83]Let's try to...
[25:56.62]I mean, I just did the exact same thing.
[26:00.02]I crashed into the wall.
[26:08.52]I mean, I get... I gotta like get to the other side and do a smash man.
[26:15.75]God damn it.
[26:16.47]That's not gonna make it to the other side.
[26:21.11]Okay.
[26:22.88]Is that gonna... Come on, keep going.
[26:25.30]No, that's not gonna cut it.
[26:27.20]Oh well.
[26:31.28]I think you're always pretending to have fun.
[26:33.24]Why would I be pretending to have fun?
[26:35.74]What, you think I'm pretending to have... Did you see the Surge stream from Friday?
[26:40.56]Are you sure about that?
[26:42.38]You think I'm, like, always pretending to have fun?
[26:44.42]Did you watch that stream on Friday?
[26:51.78]I don't know about that.
[26:54.56]This one is a bait.
[26:55.74]But I gotta, like, accidentally... Here we go.
[26:59.80]Just get it.
[27:00.22]Touch it.
[27:01.49]Didn't get it.
[27:02.81]Great.
[27:03.17]Oh, well.
[27:04.31]Let's get the explosions.
[27:08.99]Star pileup.
[27:12.19]Get launched to the other side and do it again.
[27:14.07]Except there's no cars coming now.
[27:17.37]It's worse than last time.
[27:24.01]That was so much worse that I won't even dignify it loading the rest of that.
[27:30.51]It's going to be a one hour stream.
[27:31.63]What are you talking about?
[27:32.62]We're going for at least a couple hours.
[27:34.22]At least a few hours.
[27:43.15]Come on, I need to get this... God damn it!
[27:47.26]God damn it!
[27:49.08]I just actually got angry at that.
[27:54.12]Just because we're not gonna play this game doesn't mean this could turn into a... Oh, no.
[27:59.03]No, wait, wait, wait.
[28:00.27]What are we spamming right now?
[28:02.45]Alright, fuck that one.
[28:03.23]I'm going for this one.
[28:06.41]I gotta, like, push the median, right?
[28:08.63]No.
[28:11.31]It's hilarious you kids talking shit about Jermba.
[28:13.71]You wouldn't say this shit to him at LAN.
[28:15.43]He's jacked.
[28:17.25]Not only that, but y'all... But he wears... I can't even read it.
[28:21.54]He wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants, and hangs with the hottest dudes.
[28:26.46]Y'all are pathetic.
[28:32.73]What?
[28:32.99]I don't understand this.
[28:35.07]What is this?
[28:41.48]So I think I have to land on top of this guy.
[28:45.32]That has to be a problem right now.
[28:49.90]And then that's going to take me over to the other side.
[28:52.88]But it doesn't work.
[28:55.60]I guess it just kind of worked.
[28:58.50]And I got another Smash Mouth.
[29:03.49]That did it, right?
[29:04.15]Come on.
[29:04.81]That had to have done it.
[29:08.25]What did I need?
[29:09.85]Like five and a half million?
[29:10.75]Come on.
[29:11.89]Get there.
[29:12.35]That's bullshit if it's not true.
[29:13.43]I just did everything I needed to do.
[29:19.53]What was the minimum?
[29:20.15]5.4?
[29:22.61]Give me some bonuses.
[29:26.87]More.
[29:28.68]Silver cash.
[29:29.24]Come on.
[29:31.44]Got it.
[29:31.90]Got bronze.
[29:32.38]Nice.
[29:40.75]If I had to describe me in one word, it would be fresh.
[29:44.43]Well, thank you.
[29:46.15]Hey, thank you, Base Scoop, for the $5.
[29:49.23]Jerma Jupiter, Jerma Next, Jerma Jupiter.
[29:51.75]No, I purchased this video game, and you damn well believe I'm going to give it a little while before I give you my final opinions.
[29:58.57]The game's not good.
[29:59.67]It's awful.
[30:01.40]But you're going to damn well get my opinion from this after an hour of playing it.
[30:05.30]Don't buy this.
[30:20.58]No, no, I didn't want to go to the other side.
[30:22.16]Maybe I did.
[30:23.53]Maybe I did.
[30:25.21]Come on.
[30:25.71]Come on.
[30:25.97]Come on.
[30:26.17]Come on.
[30:26.37]Come on.
[30:26.63]Come on.
[30:30.31]Keep moving.
[30:34.43]I just want to get to the blast over there.
[30:36.03]I don't care about any of you idiots.
[30:37.38]I don't think I got it.
[30:44.64]No, the game's not bad.
[30:45.48]I'm kidding.
[30:47.98]This is a fun little game to, like, show your friends, like, to have your little brother come over and, like, mess with it, right?
[30:56.02]This is one of those games where, like, you have, like, a little brother and you're like, hey, you want to learn about, like, driving?
[30:59.55]And they're like, yeah.
[31:01.21]And you're like, oh, take the wheel.
[31:03.47]And then they go, ahhh!
[31:05.29]I don't ever want to drive ever again!
[31:06.59]And you go, haha, got you, little bro!
[31:08.59]Haha!
[31:08.87]And they get scared and you, like, get your friends next to you, like, yeah!
[31:17.28]My little brother is a little shit, you know what I mean?
[31:19.25]And then your mother comes downstairs.
[31:20.25]She's like, fuck you.
[31:21.19]You can hear her coming down.
[31:22.69]You know, you can hear your mother coming down the stairs because you did something fucking bad to your little brother.
[31:26.37]It's just like, and you're like, oh shit, oh shit, hold on.
[31:30.21]And then she comes down.
[31:30.83]She's like, what the fuck are you doing in here to your fucking little brother?
[31:36.49]You're like, nothing.
[31:37.23]I just was just playing a game.
[31:45.99]And then you look like a little sh- you look like a little wuss, like a little shit in front of your friend.
[31:50.41]And you're like, fuck, my mom just like came in and like totally like blew that up.
[31:57.47]Now my like friend's not gonna like invite me to the fucking pool party on Sunday.
[32:01.11]Ow!
[32:09.92]Come on!
[32:10.78]Now we're gonna go on the Mario level.
[32:13.26]Give me that five and a half million.
[32:16.89]Ooh, somebody had some spicy food.
[32:19.33]That was not funny.
[32:20.29]I just made a spicy food joke.
[32:23.95]Get me the fuck out of here.
[32:25.07]Revoke my Twitch license.
[32:28.27]Am I drunk?
[32:28.85]No.
[32:28.97]Drunk.
[32:30.25]What the hell are you talking about?
[32:35.87]By the way, how am I, like, chaining these together?
[32:37.41]Like, winning each one of these levels?
[32:40.00]Took me, like, seven tries.
[32:42.84]I didn't win this one.
[32:44.34]I just jinxed myself.
[32:53.94]You don't like my shitty jokes?
[32:56.60]Why not?
[33:06.35]Oh my god, I hate that turn.
[33:07.81]I hate the turn.
[33:10.63]I'm restarting.
[33:11.35]I don't like the turn.
[33:16.01]Partaking in the devil's lettuce?
[33:17.33]No.
[33:27.08]Why am I getting fail fished?
[33:28.22]What did I do wrong?
[33:29.62]That means I did something wrong.
[33:32.86]Look, I didn't do anything.
[33:34.34]I swear to God.
[33:35.16]And now I can't fucking reverse the car.
[33:37.82]It's only forward in this game.
[33:41.09]Did they forget to add backwards?
[33:43.47]How do you make a car game and forget to add backwards driving?
[33:47.77]Is that possible?
[33:48.53]What did I do wrong?
[33:49.17]What's going on?
[33:55.66]I must be doing something wrong.
[34:01.50]Real drivers don't need reverse.
[34:03.22]It's probably there by design, actually.
[34:07.28]Gear shift?
[34:07.94]What do you mean gear shift?
[34:17.09]It's a manual?
[34:17.91]No, it's not.
[34:18.65]This is like an arcade driving game.
[34:21.09]There's no fucking gear shifting.
[34:29.26]Stop being cute.
[34:30.16]I'm not.
[34:30.70]Go buy this game and take a turn.
[34:32.04]You'll see.
[34:37.14]See?
[34:37.34]Like, go buy this game right now.
[34:38.88]Everybody that... Oh, 2,000 of you go buy this game right now and take a left turn.
[34:41.92]Can I get a different car eventually?
[34:49.54]I feel like I deserve it.
[34:55.76]Oh, I think I won.
[34:57.73]Come on.
[34:58.91]Oh, I win.
[35:00.49]Somebody's boat just got fucked up.
[35:01.75]I won.
[35:06.14]Sponsored.
[35:08.28]No, I don't take money from companies.
[35:11.26]I don't take money from companies, guys.
[35:13.04]What do you think I am?
[35:23.36]9 million.
[35:24.96]Thank you, Dr. Fudge, for the $5.
[35:26.38]Also, game sucks.
[35:27.50]Thanks for the $5.
[35:28.45]I mean, game, I'm okay.
[35:30.35]We're okay with the game right now.
[35:32.53]It's alright.
[35:35.63]Dr. Fudge, again, thanks for the $10.
[35:37.87]$15 in total so far.
[35:39.65]Remember, pro tip, hit the cars.
[35:42.94]Also, tell more dysfunctional family stories and you get a score multiplier.
[35:48.64]Yeah.
[35:51.02]Thanks, dude.
[35:51.96]Oh, but thank you to Brotagonist.
[35:54.50]Your jokes are 11 out of 10.
[35:55.56]Thank you.
[35:57.14]I appreciate that.
[35:58.14]I work very hard.
[36:00.10]I work very hard on it.
[36:04.19]How much money did they pay me?
[36:06.57]I'll tell you right now.
[36:08.07]A little bit of a ballpark of the bottom left number.
[36:11.17]You know what I mean?
[36:11.65]And by the way, that's in...
[36:19.21]I don't know.
[36:19.55]I'm trying to think of a currency that's very, very hot.
[36:23.95]Oh, it wants me to go down the big slide.
[36:25.21]Okay.
[36:28.03]We can do the big slide.
[36:30.59]And we got a Wii Frogger.
[36:40.86]What is like 16 million dollars in a currency that's worth like 5 bucks?
[36:50.91]I had to have done it.
[36:52.21]What was it?
[36:53.38]15 million?
[36:53.68]12?
[36:54.20]10 million?
[36:56.68]Get there.
[36:58.24]Get there.
[36:58.94]Come on.
[37:00.54]It's not going to get there.
[37:05.26]No.
[37:06.70]Maybe with a bonus?
[37:07.48]If I had enough bonuses?
[37:13.85]Don't think I did it.
[37:18.96]I'm just barely shy.
[37:23.18]Now park on the hill.
[37:30.30]Maybe I should park on the hill.
[37:37.12]I just need to weave.
[37:39.07]I want to get all the collectibles.
[37:40.61]I'm going to 100% this game.
[37:41.55]Just kidding.
[37:50.31]That guy was straight up.
[37:53.81]That guy was just like glued to the ceiling.
[37:57.28]No!
[37:57.90]I gotta get over there.
[37:58.78]I have to use the Smashbox.
[38:06.98]Come on, dammit.
[38:09.66]It's not gonna get there.
[38:12.60]I have to go fast.
[38:14.99]It's not gonna happen unless I go really fast.
[38:19.90]Vermintide.
[38:22.84]That was a really fun game.
[38:25.30]Vermintide was awesome.
[38:27.22]It just, um... I didn't like the item system.
[38:30.34]I thought it was terrible.
[38:31.50]The item system was awful in that game.
[38:33.88]Really, really awesome idea.
[38:35.06]Absolute zero out of ten execution.
[38:41.06]Keep going.
[38:41.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[38:42.73]That's all going to be smashed up.
[38:44.21]Now I'm right here.
[38:45.75]Perfect.
[38:46.33]Right when these idiots come right at me.
[38:52.89]You've got to get me close, man.
[38:56.09]10-14, come on, do it.
[39:00.91]Wait, do I lose if I do that?
[39:02.35]I don't lose the game, do I?
[39:04.35]No, I don't.
[39:05.39]I do, don't I?
[39:06.11]Oh, you fucking dumb game.
[39:10.31]That's unbelievable.
[39:11.17]If you, like, fall down, you lose.
[39:16.69]If you fall off, you lose.
[39:18.26]What?
[39:19.83]This is gonna be so hard to do this without falling down.
[39:23.29]How do they expect you to get that done?
[39:33.13]You can't fall off?
[39:34.33]That's, what?
[39:37.37]Now I'm so paranoid.
[39:38.31]Oh my god.
[39:43.73]Snoozy Liz.
[39:54.92]I'm having fun though.
[39:56.30]I need to get like in front of this.
[39:58.72]I have to miss this first one.
[40:00.68]It's not what I wanted, but it's close enough.
[40:06.26]Might still work.
[40:06.84]Let's have to get to the other side.
[40:11.87]Not gonna happen.
[40:15.01]You gotta bounce from this side to the other side.
[40:17.83]Without falling off.
[40:19.27]Because somebody that made this game thought that was a good idea.
[40:23.35]But if you fall off the edge, it's over.
[40:25.05]You just instantly lose.
[40:28.25]I'm having fun though.
[40:35.35]There we go.
[40:39.65]Do it again.
[40:42.13]Give me this one.
[40:43.63]Get me over there.
[40:44.33]There it is.
[40:44.75]Come on.
[40:45.03]Come on.
[40:45.89]I gotta hit this.
[40:46.43]I'm gonna get the next one.
[40:50.63]And then give me that 12 million.
[40:53.94]Give me that 12 million.
[40:57.36]Don't fall off the edge, please.
[41:01.88]12 million.
[41:03.14]12 million.
[41:04.84]Get me 12 million.
[41:06.98]No.
[41:07.88]No.
[41:11.02]What?
[41:11.88]I'm going to get a bonus.
[41:12.76]I have to.
[41:13.16]I got it.
[41:15.22]I definitely got it.
[41:15.96]One of the bonuses will take care of it.
[41:21.50]Taking care.
[41:21.94]We're good.
[41:26.22]I'm gonna, like, beat this whole game.
[41:30.80]We're indoors now, it seems, no?
[41:32.88]It's a huge jump.
[41:37.29]Okay, this is... What?
[41:40.23]Oh, God.
[41:42.57]Well... This just got way more difficult.
[41:47.61]Okay.
[41:49.99]Okay.
[41:52.32]Does this game have any music?
[41:53.64]I don't think it does.
[41:54.52]It did not mute.
[41:56.00]There's no audio setting.
[42:06.14]Oh, God.
[42:07.12]Hit it!
[42:11.68]Okay, we're moving.
[42:13.04]I gotta make it all the way down.
[42:15.36]Into one of these holes?
[42:24.37]Apparently.
[42:24.91]Oh, there it is, people.
[42:28.07]Come on, explosion, explosion.
[42:31.09]Hit me with the thing.
[42:34.97]I don't think I did it.
[42:35.67]That's what I have to do, though.
[42:42.63]Whoa, carnage.
[42:43.53]This is a literal crash mode in Burnout 3.
[42:49.01]I know.
[42:54.42]No, I didn't do it.
[42:55.56]What do I need?
[43:02.02]12 million.
[43:02.90]God damn.
[43:09.67]12 million.
[43:19.77]I can't see.
[43:20.44]I wish I could turn the camera right now.
[43:27.23]Let's get this side too.
[43:28.23]Hopefully I can get over there.
[43:33.68]Shit, I didn't get it.
[43:40.02]Ah, damn it.
[43:41.02]Hopefully I can cause some problems down there though.
[43:44.84]I don't... It's not going to be enough.
[43:49.59]Is Burnout 3 on Steam?
[43:50.93]I have no idea.
[44:00.75]This is the same streamer that wouldn't play Spore because he said it was bad.
[44:05.17]What are you talking about?
[44:06.65]We didn't play Spore because it was going to give people, like, aneurysm.
[44:10.29]Did you watch that stream?
[44:13.60]You guys watched my streams, right?
[44:14.72]You remember that?
[44:15.14]Remember how fucked up that was?
[44:16.30]Literally hurting people.
[44:22.63]That was a stream that was actually hurting people.
[44:28.70]I just, I totally fucked that up.
[44:30.40]Like, worse than I've ever fucked up anything in my life.
[44:34.08]And now I've fucked it up even more.
[44:38.47]No, it's not gonna do it.
[44:39.59]God damn it.
[44:43.43]Ugh.
[44:47.65]Somebody do something really dumb.
[44:48.82]This guy's still driving.
[44:49.92]Come on.
[44:57.08]Oh my god.
[45:00.34]I'll get it.
[45:00.72]Is it a toilet?
[45:05.46]Another happy landing?
[45:07.78]Yeah, pretty much.
[45:12.03]Playing Vermintide was my favorite streamer.
[45:13.43]It was the best part of that game.
[45:15.75]Well, thank you, Fox Fury, for the five bucks.
[45:18.59]Vermintide was awesome.
[45:20.55]It's just, their item system was just... It was too hard to get anything in that game.
[45:25.91]And the things that you got weren't all that different.
[45:33.56]I'm randomly rolling like a piece of shit.
[45:36.82]This has the one written all over it if I can get this.
[45:38.34]This is the one.
[45:41.02]This has the one written all over it.
[45:43.17]This has the one written all over it.
[45:47.65]Come on.
[45:48.75]This has the one written all over it.
[45:51.61]This is the one.
[45:52.69]Known as fuck.
[45:58.72]Come on.
[46:00.00]Come on.
[46:01.50]Eat shit game.
[46:02.64]Crash.
[46:03.14]More crashes.
[46:05.84]Get to like 11 or 12.
[46:06.52]Come on.
[46:07.26]Come on.
[46:12.28]Do it.
[46:15.74]It's gonna happen, right?
[46:20.28]Yeah.
[46:29.91]Why are you like this?
[46:32.18]I missed it by fucking 400,000.
[46:33.72]I need a break.
[46:38.20]What do you mean, why am I like this?
[46:47.65]Next, next.
[46:48.19]Just wait.
[46:48.67]Everybody calm down.
[46:50.63]Don't worry.
[46:52.55]I'm at that point where I have to beat this.
[46:55.91]It's got me.
[46:56.97]It's got me by the balls and it won't let go.
[47:02.17]No, don't hit me off the screen.
[47:03.63]Do not Super Smash Brothers me right now.
[47:11.62]I still have like 80%.
[47:12.56]I'm alright.
[47:18.34]No!
[47:20.50]I hate that.
[47:21.82]That sucks such an asshole.
[47:23.28]Really it does.
[47:24.64]That like fucking ruined the whole thing.
[47:25.96]Like why even have the things up here?
[47:28.87]Why have those things up top?
[47:32.73]Don't you want people to download the game and like it and want to keep playing it?
[47:35.75]No, no, no.
[47:39.39]What do you mean no?
[47:45.65]It's got me.
[47:46.65]I can't let go.
[47:48.49]I can't let go of my own balls.
[47:49.75]It's got me.
[47:57.38]God, I suck.
[47:59.46]I blew that so bad.
[48:00.82]I might as well just give up right now.
[48:04.58]Only like the... I'm so angry.
[48:13.87]Would you like this more if it was a mobile game?
[48:15.87]Probably.
[48:20.46]But, I mean, I have been playing this for just about an hour now, and I haven't stopped.
[48:26.06]And how many complaints have you heard?
[48:27.48]Not very many.
[48:29.67]I've not given that many complaints to the game.
[48:34.65]I mean, it's very basic, and... It's not like the... Look, this shit ain't gonna win any rewards.
[48:46.50]You know what I mean?
[48:47.26]This game ain't going to win any awards at the Streamys.
[48:49.80]At the Shortys.
[48:50.36]Whatever they're called.
[48:52.80]And I would have done it.
[48:53.42]Oh my god.
[49:02.02]This ain't going to win a Grammy.
[49:08.57]What are the Streamys?
[49:10.35]What's the goal?
[49:11.43]Trying to do $12 million worth of games.
[49:19.00]I haven't complained that much about this.
[49:20.34]I'm having a good time.
[49:24.06]You guys think I'm having such a bad time.
[49:25.56]I'm not.
[49:32.51]I just... Nah, I'm in no man's land over here.
[49:35.95]This is over.
[49:42.63]Watch this be the one for some dumb reason.
[49:47.08]I would totally laugh my M-O-A-O.
[49:49.66]Whatever that saying is that you kids say.
[49:54.25]Hey, what's that thing that you kids say?
[49:57.23]Laughing about it.
[49:58.13]I'm laughing about it.
[50:02.13]I-L-A-B.
[50:05.14]I-L-A-B.
[50:08.14]I. I'm laughing about it.
[50:23.99]Gimme!
[50:29.77]No!
[50:30.59]Fuck!
[50:31.73]I can't!
[50:34.03]Now I just have to watch it.
[50:35.25]I don't want to watch it.
[50:35.91]I want to participate in it.
[50:40.41]How have I done that much damage?
[50:41.77]Look at how I'm so close but so far.
[50:43.75]This would have been the one.
[50:44.84]So close but so far.
[50:45.62]Somebody touch me.
[50:47.04]Somebody put their hands on me.
[50:48.80]Come on!
[50:50.50]Please somebody put their hands on me and just move me.
[50:55.20]Fucking laughing about it.
[51:08.91]I can't stop though, guys.
[51:10.07]This is fun for me.
[51:11.21]Direct myself to the explosive while you're airborne.
[51:18.87]You know what?
[51:19.35]It's probably a better idea, but, like, I can't go that far.
[51:21.76]See how far I go?
[51:22.50]I can only go, like, that way.
[51:25.46]And then I smash-melt.
[51:27.00]And then I hopefully roll into this one, and I smash-melt the other lane.
[51:32.06]And then I grab this.
[51:35.44]And then make my way down here.
[51:36.60]This is the one.
[51:40.75]This has to be the one.
[51:41.53]It has to be.
[51:42.09]There's no way I'm not gonna get it.
[51:45.75]Get out of the way.
[51:46.25]This truck is in the way.
[51:48.26]I'm laughing about it.
[51:48.92]I got it.
[51:51.57]Not only did I get it, I really got it.
[51:54.91]I got it so bad that I'm gonna get more points.
[51:56.93]I'm good.
[52:05.89]Okay, we can move on finally.
[52:06.87]Jesus.
[52:07.01]Cool.
[52:18.34]Keep it up.
[52:19.58]Oh, I just figured out why you guys are saying next.
[52:23.32]I get it now.
[52:25.95]I love how this guy in chat, cheetah, cheetah faces, just says he's very, very polite about it.
[52:31.51]And like, he's very polite.
[52:33.41]Just says next now, please.
[52:35.69]He's so polite.
[52:39.35]They're so polite about it.
[52:41.33]I have to like listen to that person.
[52:42.73]They were so polite.
[52:46.90]Next now, like, question mark, like, please, question mark.
[52:51.49]You know, it's nice when somebody's nice to you.
[52:53.01]What's the point of me doing what I just did?
[53:00.83]That jump is so meaningless.
[53:07.75]I'm sensitive.
[53:13.45]I'm not sensitive.
[53:16.00]I'm gonna have sensitive teeth.
[53:21.46]Let me tell you something.
[53:22.20]A guy my age, nothing scares me.
[53:25.82]When I'm on the field, and I'm throwing those balls, nothing scares me.
[53:28.96]Except for one thing.
[53:34.22]Sensitive teeth.
[53:39.74]I didn't lose.
[53:49.20]Somebody got it.
[53:49.98]Somebody got it.
[53:50.50]Somebody actually got that.
[53:53.34]Somebody said Brett Favre.
[53:54.30]They got it.
[53:54.72]You are now my fucking new favorite person.
[53:56.64]You actually got it.
[53:59.36]It was like three people that got that.
[54:01.60]Unbelievable.
[54:02.32]You people are my... You're my favorite people in the world now.
[54:10.79]How much do I need?
[54:17.94]I need to know.
[54:18.90]I need to roll around.
[54:19.54]It's probably 12 million.
[54:24.56]I'm not gonna do it.
[54:25.44]I gotta get there faster.
[54:32.89]Everyone knows that commercial.
[54:34.45]No!
[54:35.39]Everybody didn't say that!
[54:38.37]I saw one guy wrote that.
[54:41.65]One person.
[54:43.64]And there are... I mean, look at how many people are here watching.
[54:46.10]Did you see how many people are here?
[54:49.34]There's like 200,000 people watching this stream and one guy says that?
[54:52.83]That's kind of ridiculous.
[54:57.13]See, 2.038 is what I see.
[54:57.91]That's 200,000.
[54:58.23]The period is not 2,000, it's 200,000.
[54:59.31]I got silver for that, by the way.
[55:01.37]Wasn't paying any attention.
[55:03.23]Yeah, it's 2.03k.
[55:18.91]to dot with 3k.
[55:19.95]I'm glad some of you guys have math degrees and figure that shit out.
[55:26.21]Okay, need 10 million.
[55:36.84]Nobody is here again.
[55:37.94]You're talking to a cactus.
[55:44.06]Well, they're not kidding when they say that it's oncoming traffic.
[55:52.82]I gotta get up there much faster.
[55:54.00]Also, I'm gonna, like, turn it down a little.
[55:57.14]I mean, this is, like, probably hurting all the little old ladies' ears that are watching the stream.
[56:01.86]You guys didn't know, I have, like, a pretty hard, like, high, large demographic of elderly that watch.
[56:07.33]Don't want to be too loud on them.
[56:10.11]Hey, Mint, thanks for the three bucks.
[56:12.45]The classic worst and best stream at the same time.
[56:17.25]Come on, this is not... We're having a fun time right now.
[56:20.65]This is a fun stream.
[56:23.93]If you don't think... Okay, let's take it to a vote.
[56:29.17]If you have... No, we're not going to do that.
[56:31.29]Because there's going to be spamming in the chat.
[56:35.79]It's going to be in the air.
[56:40.88]Get it.
[56:41.10]Come on.
[56:43.54]I got it.
[56:44.04]Okay.
[56:44.42]Good.
[56:45.04]I need to get up there.
[56:45.86]That's what I need to do.
[56:46.86]Come on.
[56:47.02]Fuck.
[56:51.67]Bounce over to here.
[56:52.43]And I went over it.
[56:56.13]I went over the fucking thing.
[56:57.83]Unbelievable.
[56:58.71]What am I going to do again?
[57:01.59]Nay, nay, nay.
[57:02.73]No, no, no, no.
[57:03.73]See, this isn't fun.
[57:07.93]Okay, hold on.
[57:08.57]Is it not fun for you or is it not fun for me?
[57:10.71]Because right now, I'm having fun.
[57:22.38]That'll take me over to here.
[57:26.70]Good.
[57:26.94]That'll cause a lot of crashing that way.
[57:29.53]Got it again.
[57:30.65]Alright, I should get it this time.
[57:32.29]What was it?
[57:37.25]12 million?
[57:37.53]Bounce me this way.
[57:41.43]Shit.
[57:42.72]That really fucked me up, but it's alright.
[57:44.12]Yeah, I'll get it.
[57:44.72]I got it.
[57:48.28]This isn't a good game to stream.
[57:50.16]What?! !
[57:51.98]What do you mean this isn't a good game to stream?
[57:54.02]There's like car accidents and explosions.
[57:56.95]Isn't that what you guys want?
[57:59.47]I thought like the twitch.tv audience wanted like a streamer that was gonna scream while there was like cars driving around and explosions everywhere.
[58:07.29]Am I doing it wrong?
[58:09.33]Should I play Hearthstone?
[58:10.33]Because that's the other way.
[58:12.80]There's only two ways to stream on twitch.tv.
[58:14.88]Cars exploding and Hearthstone.
[58:17.34]There's no other streams.
[58:18.42]There's no other way to stream.
[58:31.49]You're not screaming.
[58:32.53]Fuck, you're right.
[58:33.15]I'm not doing it right.
[58:33.89]I got gold for that one, by the way.
[58:37.87]More jokes.
[58:39.15]That's not a joke.
[58:40.11]That's the real deal.
[58:47.61]Don't you guys know there are only like three... There are only four games on Twitch.
[58:52.32]Hearthstone.
[58:54.04]Counter-Strike, Pub Battlegrounds, like, whatever the fuck that game is.
[59:02.47]And... Hold on, I really blew this.
[59:06.33]And League of Legends and Dota.
[59:09.05]And, like, Minecraft.
[59:11.23]No, Minecraft?
[59:11.77]No, no.
[59:12.37]And that's it.
[59:14.11]Because League, Dota, Counter-Strike, Hearthstone, and Pub Battlegrounds.
[59:21.75]Those are the only games.
[59:23.03]You can't play anything else.
[59:23.89]Don't ever do it.
[59:26.47]Minecraft.
[59:30.09]And Overwatch.
[59:32.67]And... Dark Souls.
[59:38.00]And... Um... It's like... Call of Duty.
[59:46.02]Battlefield.
[59:48.86]Smite.
[59:51.33]People playing Titanfall Final Fantasy is going right now pretty well.
[59:57.57]Old classic games like Mario 64.
[60:04.68]There's only a few games on Twitch.
[60:07.30]I'm reading them to you now.
[60:12.87]He's browsing the list.
[60:15.57]Hold on.
[60:15.91]Everyone calm down.
[60:16.93]Let's take a look at the fucking top games.
[60:19.29]Here we go.
[60:20.92]League of Legends, Pub Battlegrounds, Counter-Strike, Global Offensive, Hearthstone, Overwatch, GTA 5, Friday the 13th, Dota 2, H1Z1 King of the Hill, still for some reason, don't ask me why that is, IRL,
[60:39.03]Minecraft!
[60:39.71]See?
[60:40.51]World of Warcraft and Minecraft.
[60:41.95]Minecraft is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[60:46.93]It is number 12 on this list.
[60:48.87]Don't tell me Minecraft was incorrect when it's right there.
[60:53.65]Come on.
[60:57.82]I was told that Minecraft was a bad answer.
[60:59.60]Like, if we're playing Family Feud, Minecraft is going to get dinged up there.
[61:03.36]It might be like the 8th or 9th slot, but it's going to get dinged.
[61:06.66]It was not a bad answer.
[61:14.63]play it then no I don't want to play Minecraft this fucking turning in this game makes me want to seriously piss I mean I will very shortly here and now I lost my own thing hold on rat simulator is it still loud for the old people
[61:42.17]You wouldn't mind seeing Friday the 13th?
[61:44.15]I played it on Friday.
[61:44.93]It's fun.
[61:46.15]It's a fun game.
[61:46.95]I'll give you my opinion.
[61:49.11]Sorry, guys.
[61:49.67]I hit D on my keyboard, which means I peel out.
[61:54.41]Anyways.
[61:55.35]Friday the 13th feels like... I can only pay attention to this.
[62:00.34]I have to just... I'm going to take my headphone out for this one because it's very important.
[62:05.66]Friday the 13th, the game, feels like
[62:09.63]The multiplayer mode in a really cool Jason game.
[62:14.53]Where you actually play a single player campaign as Jason.
[62:18.36]And that's the multiplayer mode of that game.
[62:25.43]That really didn't need to... That wasn't that collective of a thought, but there you go.
[62:36.51]Like, can you imagine if, like, Friday the 13th, the game was actual, like, cutscenes, and you... I'm never pressing D ever again.
[62:49.76]I'm never pressing D again.
[62:53.24]Single player isn't out yet.
[62:55.44]It's cool.
[62:55.92]Okay, it's really fun.
[62:58.58]I'm going to be one of those pieces of shit that's like an uninformed person.
[63:03.88]So I am extremely uninformed.
[63:06.26]I didn't play Dead by Daylight, which it's kind of the same game, right?
[63:10.69]So if Dead by Daylight is the same kind of game, and I didn't even crash the car, I was just driving it.
[63:20.62]I don't have any opinion on, like, oh, wow, Friday the 13th, it's so good!
[63:25.54]But Dead by Daylight is... Like, is the same game.
[63:29.23]But isn't that game, like, supposed to be more fleshed out?
[63:31.49]Isn't there more stuff to do?
[63:32.61]I didn't make any money.
[63:36.07]Okay, let me pay attention for one second.
[63:40.59]Dead by Daylight is bad.
[63:41.61]Okay.
[63:44.18]So they both can, like...
[63:48.50]Dead by Daylight was a lot less complicated.
[63:49.96]Okay.
[63:52.50]Like, I just have no idea.
[63:53.64]I haven't played one second of that game.
[63:54.90]So I can't really give you, like, an opinion.
[64:02.50]Like, oh, wow, it's so great.
[64:04.73]It's the same game.
[64:07.91]This one's going to be very hard, actually.
[64:09.37]Just seeing how this is playing out.
[64:12.03]Somebody hit me.
[64:20.19]Fucking avoided me.
[64:21.45]Don't ask me how.
[64:25.99]How much do I need for this?
[64:27.33]12?
[64:27.35]Do I need 12 million for this shit?
[64:31.59]I don't.
[64:31.95]Do I?
[64:33.43]Feels like not possible.
[64:34.73]Let's see.
[64:39.96]It is 12 million.
[64:40.76]It's definitely 12 million.
[64:44.56]Shit.
[64:49.63]No, it's 7.5.
[64:50.53]I can get that.
[64:54.81]Dead by Deadlight is okay.
[64:56.31]I only played it when it was free.
[65:04.18]I just gotta get shit started and get out of the way.
[65:07.14]Really, that guy just fucked up everything.
[65:10.26]That guy blew it all.
[65:11.44]Like, big time.
[65:14.60]Might still get it.
[65:19.02]If I can get over to the other side quick enough.
[65:22.08]Still a chance.
[65:26.62]Keep going, come on.
[65:32.13]Nope.
[65:33.35]Oh, maybe.
[65:36.45]Come on, come on.
[65:37.13]More explosions.
[65:37.67]More, more, more, more, more.
[65:44.56]Shit, I might not get it.
[65:46.62]Why is he still playing this toilet set?
[65:52.03]This is not a toilet simulator.
[65:55.17]Fuck.
[65:58.61]Try Overgrowth.
[66:00.61]I'll give you an opinion about Overgrowth.
[66:03.37]That game's been... That game's been in alpha, I think, longer than I've been alive.
[66:13.91]Somebody told me to sideswipe and what you don't realize is that this game, if you like turn your car, you can't play the game.
[66:22.55]Unfortunately.
[66:23.11]I wish it wasn't the case.
[66:24.33]Nah, I gotta retry.
[66:33.83]I remember Overgrowth was a thing in closed early alpha back like five years ago.
[66:39.10]Or like six years ago.
[66:41.00]Is that game still in alpha?
[66:45.42]Guys, the fucking Nightmare Before Christmas took like eight years to make.
[66:50.03]When this game actually launches, is it gonna be fucking as good as The Nightmare Before Christmas?
[66:54.13]Hope so.
[67:02.40]Shit.
[67:02.98]Bad spot.
[67:03.62]I gotta move.
[67:10.66]Gotta wait for the next train of cars.
[67:12.82]Ah, they're getting stuck back there.
[67:13.92]Not good.
[67:14.28]I have to go over there and blow it up.
[67:19.29]Right in, right in here.
[67:21.29]There it is.
[67:25.62]I like James and the Giant Peach more.
[67:31.80]The game looked kinda cool.
[67:33.22]You fight as like little rabbits, right?
[67:38.13]You jump around as a rabbit.
[67:39.73]And you have like, sloppy hands.
[67:42.79]You make stew.
[67:48.70]Yes, I am still playing this game.
[67:50.84]Why is that such a shock to everybody?
[67:54.36]I can't, like, play this dumb game?
[67:57.30]Why not?
[68:00.16]Why is it so hard to believe that this fucking idiot that's sitting in this chair right now wants to keep playing the game where you just run into cars?
[68:08.98]I'm not a smart man, okay?
[68:10.62]I never claimed to be.
[68:12.50]But... But my IQ... Excuse me.
[68:16.15]Let's talk about this for a second.
[68:18.55]My IQ was tested.
[68:21.21]Because they thought I was... My parents thought there was something wrong with me.
[68:25.79]I had my IQ tested twice.
[68:28.93]And my performance IQ was off the charts.
[68:31.53]No, no, no, excuse me, that was not correct.
[68:34.31]My performance IQ is very low.
[68:36.76]Alright, hold on a second, let me just crash a couple of cars!
[68:41.30]And then we'll talk about it.
[68:46.16]Look at how big my IQ is!
[68:49.38]I like smashing in your cars.
[68:51.08]Oh, that was fun.
[68:55.43]I want to be a brain surgeon.
[68:59.19]I might actually win.
[69:19.82]Okay.
[69:26.46]Did I win?
[69:27.56]I got it.
[69:28.30]Alright, anyways, so... My IQ has been tested twice.
[69:32.83]I'm gonna give it to you straight.
[69:33.81]This is as real as I'm ever gonna get on a stream, okay?
[69:37.87]My IQ when it was first tested was like 126.
[69:41.33]Okay?
[69:41.53]It was like... It was 126 when I was like 14.
[69:49.90]I did terrible in, like, middle school and high school, by the way.
[69:52.60]I was just too fucking smart for them.
[69:55.69]But hold on.
[69:56.15]It was tested again.
[69:56.89]It was tested again.
[69:58.79]Hold on.
[69:59.47]Everybody quiet for a second.
[70:01.39]It was tested again in college.
[70:02.85]I did, like, an extensive... And by the way... By the way!
[70:06.29]Everybody that's watching right now an IQ test is not one of those like fucking pop-up windows Where you go like I would like to see what my IQ is calm and it's like fucking takes you three minutes No, and I a real IQ test takes like fucking six hours It's like hundreds of fucking pages.
[70:23.14]You don't just like open up like a shitty web page Www.com or no, it doesn't work like that.
[70:30.37]It's like a fucking seven hour test So like don't come to me
[70:36.29]with this bullshit so I went so here you go I was a 126 when I was like 14 or something right I got tested again in college went down to 124 lost a few brain cells in college and I'm gonna be straight with you if I took it that was like 10 years ago if I took that test again right now I'd be like 116 I'm losing brain cells I'm becoming less intelligent I just am I know that I am
[71:06.00]So, I mean, I would say I'm like 118.
[71:09.29]Like 119.
[71:10.15]I mean, I'm losing brain cells at a rapid rate.
[71:13.25]So, it's only a matter of time before I'm down to like 65.
[71:17.17]I'm going to be 65 IQ when I'm 65.
[71:21.29]That's fine.
[71:21.73]I'm going to be old.
[71:22.39]Who cares?
[71:22.81]It doesn't matter.
[71:26.13]Who the fuck do I have to impress when I'm 65?
[71:27.35]Nobody.
[71:34.34]You're aging rapidly.
[71:40.79]Do an IQ test on stream right now.
[71:42.91]No, that's like a very tedious, like... It's a very tedious process.
[71:46.81]You have to be very focused and you have to be chewing double bubble.
[71:50.94]I have to chew d- Excuse me.

[72:11.05]There's nobody- I'm looking at the fucking car.
[72:14.75]I need to- I need to chew double bubble.
[72:16.97]It has to be double bubble, by the way.

[72:19.67]He sucks.
[72:20.13]His comics aren't funny.
[72:21.63]And I'm glad he's dead.
[72:24.81]None of this bullshit.
[72:40.56]Bazooka Joe, the cartoon character!
[72:43.47]Don't you guys understand?
[72:44.01]Don't you know who that is?
[72:46.67]And stride gum, all these like new age gums, like who the fuck?
[72:49.81]Why would you have that?
[72:54.32]Stride gum, they try to be so edgy and like hippy dippy with this bullshit.
[72:59.02]No, double bubble is the best bubble gum.
[73:01.36]Don't ever say otherwise.
[73:03.50]Or you and I are gonna have a big problem.
[73:07.96]So yes, I have an above average IQ.
[73:10.55]I do.
[73:10.81]I'm not going to pretend like I don't.
[73:13.77]I don't have to lie to you guys.
[73:16.05]It's like, right now it's probably like 118.
[73:17.53]Would you like me to get the documentation?
[73:22.82]I could find it.
[73:23.22]I'm going to call up my old professor.
[73:26.28]Professor Gunglestein.
[73:27.42]He's the one that fucking did it for me.
[73:36.09]Stop.
[73:36.71]Stop what?
[73:42.13]how it chews to feel yeah how it chews how it chews to feel how it feels to this look at this fucking high IQ in fucking in orbit how it feels to chew five gum oh it's like sexual I'm like lying down in like this like all these orbs vibrating all over my body what the fuck are you doing it's gum double bubble only buy that only buy double bubble support those companies did I win
[74:16.81]I did.
[74:27.52]What about Hubba Bubba?
[74:28.52]Eh.
[74:28.64]I don't know about that.
[74:30.76]Double bubble.
[74:37.01]125 was above average.
[74:38.29]When I took the test...
[74:40.67]Maybe they got a different test nowadays, but like 1.25 was considered like a highly intelligent person.
[74:46.11]By the way, isn't like 1.40 or 1.50 considered like your brain is so big that you can like manipulate time?
[74:54.97]So, okay, so you've got 1.60 is I can literally manipulate time with my brain.
[75:01.15]And I was at 1.26.
[75:02.33]I mean, pretty fucking good.
[75:04.82]Guys, come on.
[75:19.98]High IQ still playing this game.
[75:22.68]I don't have a high IQ.
[75:24.22]I have an above average IQ.
[75:26.28]I never said it was high.
[75:26.94]Where are you guys getting that from?
[75:31.25]There's a difference between a high... A high IQ would be like 130 plus.
[75:34.47]Like 140.
[75:35.11]I have an above average IQ.
[75:37.15]I never said it was high.
[75:43.99]Here we go.
[75:45.91]Semantics.
[75:46.93]Ha ha ha.
[75:50.23]I know, right?
[75:52.41]What am I doing here?
[75:53.25]No brakes?
[76:00.57]I guess I just kind of have to thank Luff for ruining everything, truck.
[76:11.12]It was actually kind of good that that happened.
[76:16.10]I didn't do it, though.
[76:16.78]I gotta go down each level.
[76:21.13]Nobody tell IQ... Nobody... God damn it.
[76:23.35]I'm just proving that I'm an idiot.
[76:25.33]Nobody tell Jerma that IQ doesn't matter.
[76:27.97]I know that.
[76:29.69]I prefaced this whole thing by saying that I know.
[76:32.70]I'm just gonna be real.
[76:34.60]IQ doesn't fucking matter.
[76:35.96]You can have 145 IQ and like just sit there with like a VR helmet on all day with your thumb up your ass.
[76:42.18]I know.
[76:42.52]Because that is me.
[76:45.34]I do that.
[76:45.82]And I have a fucking very, very above averagely high IQ.
[76:51.16]Look, I know that you could have, like, 160 IQ and just be hitting your head against a wall.
[76:55.50]And, like, somebody asks you, why are you doing that?
[76:57.08]And you're like, for science.
[76:58.58]And you're like, okay, but that person's fucking crazy.
[77:06.88]That sounds like something in 126... I don't even... Whatever you said.
[77:13.61]Thank you, Tub, for the... Hold on, let me... I'll say thank you in a second.
[77:23.48]I missed out on that whole thing.
[77:25.97]I missed out on everything.
[77:27.15]We're restarting.
[77:34.57]IQ is based on an outdated idea of intelligence.
[77:36.83]But what do they use now?
[77:38.95]Like MCAS?
[77:39.69]Like, are you serious?
[77:44.18]Like all the standardized testing bullshit they do now?
[77:47.62]Which, by the way, I'm totally against, by the way.
[77:51.08]Standardized testing.
[77:51.78]Education is a dynamic thing.
[77:54.08]Want me to talk like politics with you guys?
[77:55.44]Education is dynamic.
[77:57.64]We don't base it around like a fucking test you take.
[78:00.08]I had a lot of issues with the MCAS.
[78:01.50]Let's talk MCAS.
[78:03.24]Get out of my fucking parking spot.
[78:04.69]I'm busy.
[78:05.13]Alright, well I lose.
[78:17.08]Razor IQ test.
[78:22.95]High IQ streamer bashes standardized testing.
[78:29.79]Stop with the IQ.
[78:31.75]We don't need education politics.
[78:33.51]Oh god, what have I done?
[78:35.91]Is this a meltdown stream?
[78:36.85]Every stream is a meltdown stream.
[78:38.12]Don't you guys know that?
[78:43.98]Somebody got... What do you mean bingo?
[78:47.66]What do you mean bingo?
[78:53.24]Who's playing bingo?
[78:54.84]I just saw like three bingos.
[78:58.74]Shit, I gotta get this.
[79:02.86]I gotta stay down here.
[79:06.22]Come on, give it to me.
[79:07.06]I got one more breaker.
[79:09.93]That's it.
[79:14.25]I'm still playing this piece of... It's like eight, isn't it?
[79:17.43]Fuck me, it's eight.
[79:19.27]I hope not.
[79:19.91]Well, maybe I'll get some bonuses.
[79:26.21]They made a bingo card.
[79:27.45]Oh.
[79:29.21]Okay.
[79:29.53]Well, there's a bingo card.
[79:33.05]They play your stream with that TV at the local old folks home.
[79:36.31]Alright, I got silver.
[79:36.91]I'm good.
[79:42.45]I'm like, actually, I'm enjoying this.
[79:44.10]I'm enjoying this.
[79:44.90]This is a very good... I'm having a lot of fun on this stream.
[79:52.20]Like, I'm enjoying this game.
[79:53.94]It's not as bad as everybody's saying.
[79:55.14]It's bad.
[79:56.52]It's not recommended.
[79:57.44]But, like, sometimes you just need a game to play while you hang out with your fucking 5,000 friends.
[80:02.00]You know what I mean?
[80:03.26]Are we all going to go off the jump?
[80:13.23]Well, apparently not anymore.
[80:15.59]I'm, like, driving like a dickhead.
[80:18.07]At least I still got it.
[80:26.85]Where's my car?
[80:27.65]What?
[80:30.91]2,000 is not 5,000.
[80:31.37]I've never said that.
[80:34.75]So, never said 5,000.
[80:36.99]Never came out of my mouth one time.
[80:47.91]I did not say 5,000.
[80:55.45]I would appreciate if, like, people would, you know, cut that out.
[81:04.42]Never said five thousand.
[81:12.15]Stop lying to us?
[81:12.85]What do you mean stop lying?
[81:19.91]You find a clip of me saying that.
[81:21.45]And I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
[81:23.49]I don't see any clips in the fucking chat.
[81:25.32]Sorry.
[81:26.06]Never happened.
[81:30.12]Shit.
[81:35.52]I'm just watching this.
[81:40.95]I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
[81:43.25]If I hear myself saying that I said 5,000 people.
[81:52.53]Let's take a look.
[81:53.51]Okay, fine.
[81:54.61]I'll play your game.
[82:01.54]Stop lying to us?
[82:02.34]What do you mean stop lying?
[82:07.74]It's not her.
[82:09.32]You find a clip of me saying that.
[82:10.88]Yeah, you didn't find it.
[82:12.36]You just clipped what I just said.
[82:15.77]You clipped what I just said.
[82:17.37]That's not me saying it.
[82:26.17]It's a wrong clip, guys.
[82:27.03]Let's check this one.
[82:34.75]Saying that I said 5,000 people.
[82:38.04]Yeah, again, not correct.
[82:39.76]Let's take a look.
[82:44.34]Okay, fine.
[82:45.48]I'll play your game.
[82:50.00]This is not it.
[82:50.50]Stop lying to us?
[82:53.08]What do you mean, stop lying?
[82:54.65]I didn't, this is wrong.
[82:55.61]You guys don't have the actual clip.
[82:57.17]To what I just said.
[82:58.39]That's not, that's not me saying it.
[83:00.01]No, we're not doing that joke again, by the way.
[83:01.99]We're not going to, we're not going to do that joke.

[83:18.06]Saying that I said 5,000 people.
[83:21.58]Yeah.
[83:22.70]Wrong again.
[83:25.02]That's fine.
[83:30.36]No one's got the right clip.
[83:36.61]People are just linking the clip of me saying it.
[83:40.53]I don't see the right one.
[83:42.93]You've done it once already.
[83:44.39]No.

[88:10.77]Play funny clips to spice up boring stream.
[88:17.20]What?
[88:17.90]Boring stream?
[88:20.90]Come on.
[88:27.20]I need to have my... Okay, I'm back.
[88:29.94]No, this is not even the right fucking Twitch channel.
[88:33.17]Who owns this channel?
[88:34.73]Because they're in deep shit.
[88:40.87]Okay, we're good.
[88:43.06]Let's play.
[88:43.60]Let's continue Danger Zone.
[88:47.00]We're already this deep.
[88:48.70]We're in too deep, guys.
[88:52.10]We got in way too deep.
[89:02.79]Oh, I forgot to say thanks to the people that gave bits and subs and everything.
[89:12.26]I think I should leave all these guys alone.
[89:18.44]Yeah, I'm gonna leave them alone.
[89:19.40]Try to land right on here.
[89:20.58]And then... No, that was bad.
[89:22.62]I can't see.
[89:26.06]I wish I could look underneath me.
[89:28.48]Well, here we go again.
[89:34.01]I'm not going to get it.
[89:43.06]I need to hit that one all the way to the left.
[89:48.02]Next?
[89:48.40]No.
[89:51.87]Is that a bird?
[89:52.87]Or do I hear like a siren?
[89:53.87]I don't know.
[90:00.35]I have to hit that one.
[90:03.60]This game is burnout without the fun.
[90:05.78]Come on.
[90:06.56]Be nice.
[90:08.20]The whole dev team is here watching.
[90:12.96]In fact, like, I wouldn't be surprised if 2,000... There were 2,000 people on this dev team.
[90:19.35]So, like, there's only 200 of you here.
[90:21.55]You're outnumbered by the fucking dev team.
[90:23.39]2,000 strong.
[90:27.19]Mastodon Entertainment.
[90:31.21]God fucking damn it.
[90:43.32]I'll work on this game.
[90:46.22]I have to hit the one all the way to the left.
[90:49.44]I... Alright, we're still okay.
[90:54.22]Except we're not.
[90:55.16]We're actually not at all.
[90:58.30]Good job on the game, you guys.
[91:00.44]Everybody's... I just... That's so funny.
[91:04.29]That's fucking hilarious, actually.
[91:07.89]Okay, good job, guys.
[91:08.95]Hey, Frank, you wanna grab me like a slice in the office?
[91:13.80]Hey, is Carol in here yet?
[91:16.68]Yeah, we're all watching this one random fuckface play our game.
[91:19.58]There's thousands of us in here.
[91:24.01]Guys talking about what you're doing this weekend.
[91:27.37]Good job, everybody.
[91:35.27]We'd really like it if you stopped playing our game, Jeremy.
[91:37.27]You're not representing what it could be.
[91:45.74]I know that guy.
[91:46.82]I love that Easter egg you put in level 12.
[92:04.25]I love that Easter egg you put in level 12, Mike.
[92:06.91]Hey, by the way, Mike, now that I got you here, why did you sleep with my wife?
[92:17.32]And then we gotta like time people out.
[92:19.48]Fucking come on.
[92:20.58]I gotta pay attention.
[92:22.42]I'm not paying any attention.
[92:24.10]And it's causing distress.
[92:29.18]Good ol' dirty mic.
[92:43.34]Right off the edge.
[92:49.74]That's what I needed.
[92:50.82]Yes.
[92:51.52]Got it.
[92:52.46]Okay.
[92:52.80]That should be good.
[92:54.50]This should take me to where I need to be.
[92:58.44]I hope.
[92:58.78]I need to cause accidents.
[93:05.05]That should cause a lot of accidents.
[93:08.41]And somehow it's less than the last time.
[93:11.25]Don't ask me how.
[93:15.82]Good guy, Ty.
[93:16.50]Thanks for the $3.
[93:17.50]I'd rather watch Skate 3.
[93:19.81]Well, Skate 3 is not set up and I've never played that game.
[93:22.63]So you're gonna have to rather watch it from some other extremely intelligent streamer.
[93:29.29]Are there a lot of them?
[93:30.75]I don't know anything about streamers.
[93:33.31]Tell me your favorite streamers, guys.
[93:36.59]Who are they?
[93:39.78]Who are your favorite streamers?
[93:44.20]And don't put me on that list because we already know.
[93:46.64]I'm number one.
[93:56.25]I'm done with you.
[93:57.23]Whoa, what?
[93:58.21]Come on.
[93:58.73]What?
[93:59.15]I'm done with you.
[94:00.01]What did I do?
[94:03.07]I'm done with you.
[94:05.56]That just like made me sad.
[94:06.80]That actually made me sad.
[94:09.86]Somebody just like in plain text, no capitals, no punctuation, just said, I'm done with you.
[94:16.44]Fuck, that hurts like more than if somebody like called me a million names.
[94:21.01]God, I'm like up on the rafters.
[94:29.81]I've seen a lot of Vinny.
[94:31.41]I've seen a lot of Vinny in Vinesauce.
[94:37.95]I trust you guys.
[94:45.61]You know, I think I actually have watched Vinny stream before.
[94:49.88]I think I've watched Vinesauce.
[94:52.38]At some point in my incredibly boring life.
[94:56.98]I sit in a watch like fucking paint dry.
[95:00.52]You know what?
[95:00.80]I'm not watching paint dry.
[95:04.91]I'm not contemplating fucking neurophysics.
[95:07.85]I'm watching Vinny Vinesaw.
[95:10.85]I think I got it.
[95:18.84]I don't watch any streamers.
[95:19.70]I really don't.
[95:28.80]It's still not enough.
[95:30.79]What the fuck?
[95:31.73]How much is it?
[95:34.49]What?
[95:36.47]Oh my god, it was 9 million.
[95:37.89]I hate my life.
[95:39.77]I hate my... I hate my digital fake car life.
[95:48.39]I'm comparing Vinesauce to watching paint dry?
[95:51.27]No, I didn't.
[95:51.83]I said that's what... Wait a minute.
[95:53.93]I said that's what I do.
[95:56.21]I didn't say that has anything to do with what they're doing.
[96:03.39]I just told you guys one of my hobbies.
[96:05.41]Don't doctor a fucking video of me saying that, come on.
[96:11.05]We all saw how easy that is.
[96:24.48]Don't doctor the facts.
[96:34.18]I gotta get over there.
[96:34.84]I have to get this one.
[96:38.74]And then I have to get this one too!
[96:39.98]Come on!
[96:41.58]Got it!
[96:42.62]Nooo!
[96:44.24]Shhh, it's over.
[96:47.02]And there's no saving this one.
[96:51.94]I gotta go all the way across.
[96:59.42]The implication was that Vinny was the last resort.
[97:01.74]No, that's not what the implication was!
[97:08.29]At least Vinny actually gets 5,000 viewers.
[97:11.82]Hey!
[97:13.68]I never said that!
[97:15.12]Don't turn this on me, I'm your fucking grandpa here!
[97:18.20]Okay?
[97:18.86]Don't talk about, don't yell at your grandfather like this shit.
[97:26.59]It's not about the viewers, it's the motion of the ocean, alright?
[97:34.87]I don't know how many viewers, you could have 10 viewers, you could have 20,000 viewers.
[97:38.12]It's the motion, it's how well you do.
[97:44.14]No, I don't have any, what are you talking about?
[97:46.40]I'm sure he's a fucking swell guy, I don't know anything about him.
[97:49.36]I'm sure they're all swell guys.
[97:50.65]I'm sure they're all fucking cool.
[97:51.67]I don't know, I don't know anything.
[97:53.37]Don't doctor any images of me.
[98:03.57]Don't make Twitch drama for me.
[98:05.62]I'm not prepared for that.
[98:06.70]I'm too old and frail for that.
[98:07.96]I didn't make it.
[98:16.59]It's about how much money you can scam?
[98:18.33]What?
[98:21.60]This is not a joke.
[98:22.58]This is not a gag.
[98:23.51]We want you to play something else.
[98:27.73]I kind of like this dynamic, though.
[98:30.23]The fact that all you guys, like, fucking hate this.
[98:33.59]It's kind of funny.
[98:35.97]You know, does anybody else think that's funny?
[98:37.29]That, like, everybody fucking... I hate this.
[98:39.57]But I'm still here doing it.
[98:40.45]Imagine you rear-ended somebody and they fucking exploded.
[98:45.93]Fuck.
[98:55.13]I gotta get even more speed.
[99:03.03]This might be okay if I can hop over there.
[99:09.80]Got it.
[99:10.24]Come on, come on, come on!
[99:12.86]No, this is so sloppy.
[99:16.26]This is way too sloppy.
[99:19.81]It would have been it if it wasn't so sloppy.
[99:22.21]In fact, it still might be okay, but it was sloppy.
[99:26.45]Nope.
[99:38.12]Sloppy.
[99:43.20]We'll get it though, don't worry.
[99:54.91]This game is making no sales because of this stream.
[99:58.09]I'm not trying to get, like, sales for the game.
[100:00.09]I'm not like a salesman here, guys.
[100:08.57]Why would I be a salesman for this game?
[100:12.69]It's fun enough.
[100:13.27]I'm having a good time.
[100:14.73]Except this is definitely not the one.
[100:19.14]Wait, it might be.
[100:22.32]Why did I just get that?
[100:23.06]That doesn't make any sense.
[100:27.16]This actually might be it.
[100:27.90]Come on.
[100:28.22]Give me nine million.
[100:29.06]Nine million.
[100:29.52]Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.
[100:30.50]Come on.
[100:33.96]Nope.
[100:40.01]I need more momentum.
[100:49.19]I'm only doing this for the big check I cash every month.
[100:52.93]Usually spent on clown makeup and spaghetti.
[100:58.75]No, I don't... Come on.
[101:00.87]Don't paint me as that.
[101:01.79]Don't paint that picture.
[101:06.40]That's enough speed.
[101:09.20]That's enough speed, for sure.
[101:16.25]It's gonna be close.
[101:17.25]No, I'm not even there.
[101:18.61]I don't like this level, really, at all.
[101:23.07]I have to get this explosion, though.
[101:24.45]There's too many cars that aren't getting hit.
[101:28.87]Come on.
[101:30.31]No.
[101:34.54]Need more thrust?
[101:37.62]I'm doing something wrong for sure.
[101:39.98]I don't know what though.
[101:44.44]I won't chat about paint.
[101:49.15]You moaned out of boredom?
[101:50.75]Oh god.
[101:51.89]That's not a good thing.
[101:56.35]It's a bad thing.
[102:02.70]Is there more to this game or is this it?
[102:04.94]What you see is what you get here.
[102:08.82]This is pretty much the game.
[102:16.71]Fucking... I had to land on this dumb school bus.
[102:22.01]Great.
[102:25.17]God damn it.
[102:25.74]This would have been close too.
[102:27.18]I have to beat this.
[102:28.02]I have to beat this level.
[102:28.86]I really do.
[102:29.26]I have to.
[102:38.28]You like the theory that I made this game?
[102:40.72]No.
[102:41.12]Well, I didn't.
[102:42.18]It's alright to burst your bubble.
[102:51.31]It's 4 AM and I want you to play another game.
[102:55.37]Alright, I just did- I did a double explosion.
[103:02.32]Come on, really?
[103:06.36]Ah, this is gonna be so good, too.
[103:07.60]I just need to be moving in the other way.
[103:09.16]Fuck.
[103:13.20]Ah, I'm so close, but so far.
[103:14.56]Oh, well.
[103:20.11]That's so unfortunate.
[103:21.03]5,000 explosions.
[103:30.48]Is he still playing this game?
[103:31.83]He is.
[103:33.43]Unfortunately, he is.
[103:34.29]I appreciate your concern, though.
[103:42.94]He's been doing the same shit over and over again for 30 minutes.
[103:49.90]I'm just gonna move over to the other side now.
[103:51.82]See if I can roll over here.
[103:53.30]Yeah, I got another Smash Breaker.
[103:54.40]This should be it, because a lot of shit's going on over there.
[103:59.17]Come on.
[103:59.77]This is it.
[104:00.53]This is the one.
[104:03.17]Here come the cars.
[104:10.74]That's it.
[104:11.48]Got it.
[104:13.36]Finally!
[104:13.74]I can actually move the hell on.
[104:15.44]I can't believe this took 2,000 people to make.
[104:19.86]Yeah.
[104:20.52]That's a lot of people.
[104:31.07]New game plus.
[104:32.33]Can we stop now?
[104:39.51]This should be the main stream game.
[104:42.57]I wonder how many levels.
[104:44.33]After this I want to go look and see how many levels there are in this game.
[104:49.74]We're going to check.
[104:54.22]I voted for perception.
[104:55.82]We're still going to... I'll check that game up before I stop streaming.
[105:01.53]After this level, we're gonna see just what this game is.
[105:06.91]Just what this game entails.
[105:07.87]Come on.
[105:18.86]I'm gonna need a lot of points, I assume, for this.
[105:25.86]So much going on.
[105:28.38]God.
[105:29.52]I want to go forward, not backwards.
[105:30.74]Come on.
[105:32.31]Shit.
[105:38.15]What was the minimum for here?
[105:39.21]There's 2,000 people watching you play this shit.
[105:46.80]Yeah, I guess there is.
[105:57.26]That was very fucking easy.
[105:59.94]Alright, let's go to the main menu.
[106:01.36]Let's take a look here.
[106:04.58]Single player.
[106:05.22]There only is single player.
[106:13.66]Guys, we're about to beat the game.
[106:17.88]I have to beat the game.
[106:20.78]We're so close.
[106:27.48]Snap out of it always look at how close we are We're gonna get to the very end we're gonna get the big rainbow road we're gonna win It's not worth it Stop it.
[106:46.61]I'm an agony.
[106:47.25]I'm at the end of the game.
[106:49.83]I'm gonna beat this fucking dumb game I
[106:54.36]You understand?
[106:54.84]Like, I will be one of the only people on Steam to beat this game.
[107:02.22]I'm gonna lose my 5,000 units.
[107:10.19]Wow, that was actually pretty cool.
[107:16.17]Get me over to the other side.
[107:17.01]Nah, I didn't make it to the other side.
[107:20.73]You gotta sneak through the, uh, corridors there.
[107:25.21]I'm the only person on Steam to own the game.
[107:27.57]I don't think so.
[107:32.03]13 million.
[107:33.13]Chat is so dramatic.
[107:39.59]They're not.
[107:40.91]I love chat.
[107:43.68]How could you not like chat?
[107:47.94]Sneak over here.
[107:55.59]Damn it.
[107:56.73]I should have held on to that.
[107:58.39]I shouldn't have... I should have not done that.
[108:00.26]I'll get it this time.
[108:10.52]Holy shit, is this the guy that beat Danger Zone on stream?
[108:17.13]I lost 100 viewers.
[108:18.67]Quick, change while you still can.
[108:27.28]Get the one in the middle.
[108:28.02]Move over here.
[108:30.68]Nice.
[108:31.18]Okay.
[108:31.95]Perfect.
[108:32.93]I am ready for 13 million points.
[108:34.55]Just wait for this to pass.
[108:39.53]Here they come.
[108:42.43]And... There it is.
[108:53.35]He got more viewers.
[108:55.29]Did I?
[108:56.59]Did I actually?
[109:04.05]Why did the levels get... The levels got easier.
[109:05.81]We're going to beat this game on stream.
[109:16.01]We're going to beat the game.
[109:20.98]There's only like six more levels, guys.
[109:23.61]Not even.
[109:26.97]Look, this one's cool.
[109:33.54]Listen to the Jermamites.
[109:34.66]Well, what do you guys want?
[109:55.15]What do you guys want?
[109:58.47]Um... Okay, I didn't do anything, but hopefully this helps.
[110:04.85]Who wants four?
[110:06.39]Is it possible to unsubscribe?
[110:10.72]Come on, don't say that.
[110:12.96]You don't mean that.
[110:13.66]12 million.
[110:29.56]I didn't even- I- How the fuck did I not make the jump?
[110:34.98]What the hell was that?
[110:35.94]There we go.
[110:57.00]That's what we needed.
[110:57.84]Right there.
[110:58.18]Come on.
[110:59.14]Come on.
[110:59.48]How are there no accidents up there?
[111:05.68]You told me the traffic is fine up there right now.
[111:09.90]No fucking way.
[111:14.23]What a joke.
[111:18.95]Got one car with that.
[111:26.79]leave this game.
[111:30.23]I looked it up.
[111:30.85]Only 65 people have beat Zone 3.
[111:33.62]God damn it.
[111:36.38]Cough twice.
[111:38.16]Cough twice if the devs are blackmailing you.
[111:43.52]They're blackmailing me.
[111:49.38]I pressed W. You know what I was going to say.
[111:59.76]The game is a sinking ship.
[112:08.82]I'm actually kind of hungry right now.
[112:11.81]Sometimes you just... Wait.
[112:12.59]Sometimes these don't work.
[112:18.93]It's been two hours, Jeremiah.
[112:20.01]I know, I know.
[112:20.85]But, like, I'm at the point... I'm at the point where I have to complete it.
[112:29.47]You know what else is on the list here, guys?
[112:31.57]Sniper Ghost Wolf 3.
[112:35.35]And Perception.
[112:38.23]Whatever the hell that game is.
[112:39.31]I actually might give up.
[112:50.08]I might give up real soon here.
[112:56.05]I might have to give up.
[113:01.12]God, I want, like, cheese right now.
[113:02.68]I'm trying to do this dairy-free thing.
[113:05.12]It's not really working for me.
[113:07.58]I need my cheese.
[113:08.36]I gotta have my pops.
[113:10.70]I'm in pain in the ass.
[113:17.45]I'm in a fucking pain in the ass.
[113:18.91]I still can drive the car right off the cliff.
[113:32.52]Alright, you win.
[113:34.88]You guys win.
[113:36.72]Wait, hold on.
[113:37.34]What?
[113:38.82]This is locked.
[113:46.63]There's only two more levels, guys.
[113:48.73]I just have to beat this one.
[113:49.67]There's only two levels left.
[113:53.07]Right?
[113:55.27]Yeah, there's two levels left.
[113:58.83]You guys didn't win.
[114:11.46]55th place with zero points.
[114:13.86]That's remarkable, actually.
[114:16.91]That is remarkable.
[114:27.08]You want to see the credits to see if I'm in the credits.
[114:30.58]Why does it not work sometimes?
[114:35.88]Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[114:45.27]Yeah, this is crash mode from Burnout, except the only difference is it's like two and a half hours long.
[114:50.25]Why does this not work?
[114:55.92]I don't know.
[115:07.89]Thank god.
[115:08.39]Alright, this has got to be the one.
[115:10.37]Oh my god!
[115:11.23]Pfft.
[115:20.80]Okay.
[115:21.90]Let's open up that other game.
[115:25.21]There's another game that we have tonight.
[115:27.99]Alright, are we playing Sniper Ghost Wolf?
[115:32.13]Should I play Sniper Ghost Wolf?
[115:37.08]What do you guys think?
[115:41.12]I'm going to give you guys a poll.
[115:49.72]Let's do this drop hole thing.
[116:13.16]Alright, guys.
[116:13.52]What do you want to see for the next, like, hour and some change?
[116:20.20]Which one?
[116:28.20]We got Sniper Ghost Wolf 3 or we got Perception.
[116:35.77]Apparently it's a spooky game or something.
[116:41.15]While you guys figure that out, I'm going to go use the restroom.
[116:44.95]I'll be right back.
[116:47.15]Please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle.
[116:50.79]I know.
[116:51.85]I know that was lame.
[116:52.52]I'm sorry.
[116:52.94]Goodbye.
[116:53.22]I'll be right back.
[119:52.07]I'm back.
[119:55.31]Nobody tell me nobody.
[119:56.17]Okay.
[119:56.71]Nobody tell me I'm seeing great.
[119:58.33]What's that mean?
[120:00.47]Alright.
[120:01.33]Last time.
[120:04.65]Last time somebody said don't say anything.
[120:06.06]Somebody gave me $100.
[120:06.52]Did I get $100 again?
[120:07.40]Nope.
[120:07.56]What are you talking about?
[120:17.84]What did I do?
[120:23.81]I didn't do anything.
[120:24.71]I went and I peed.
[120:30.61]What's the poll look like?
[120:32.47]You guys want to see the blind game?
[120:35.22]I guess that's what we're doing.
[120:36.18]So let's try it.
[120:41.60]Wait, wait, wait.
[120:42.98]Vinish came over here?
[120:44.26]And I was on a BRB screen, so he was like, wow, this stream sucks.
[120:48.94]And he left.
[120:52.96]That's so funny.
[120:57.93]Clown facecam?
[120:58.83]I'm not doing a facecam.
[121:07.19]No one tell him what.
[121:09.05]Vinny hates me.
[121:09.80]What did I do?
[121:10.28]He said he has a higher... He probably does have a higher IQ.
[121:13.54]He's a smart person.
[121:14.70]Alright, hold on.
[121:29.20]I don't even, my facecam's not even plugged in.
[121:31.32]Look, if it gets scary, I'll plug it in.
[121:37.92]What the fuck are you eating, somebody?
[121:40.08]Sam.
[121:43.38]It's one of those freeze pops.
[121:44.80]You guys remember freeze pops?
[121:48.22]It's one of those, alright.
[121:49.92]I gotta think of a title.
[121:56.30]What's a good title for this game?
[121:57.86]How about no facecam?
[122:00.35]Unwatchable stream.
[122:01.47]It's an orange Reese pop.
[122:10.58]I love these things.
[122:13.76]Motivated.
[122:18.36]I'm such a stupid asshole.
[122:19.76]I keep closing this.
[122:20.78]Okay.
[122:31.05]Um, I was just gonna write namaste.
[122:34.65]Why?
[122:34.99]I don't know why that just popped in my head.
[122:38.67]Like, namaste.
[122:42.19]Alright, so I'm just moved over here.
[122:44.39]I'm actually kind of scared.
[122:45.41]Something just fucking moved right here.
[122:47.59]What is that?
[122:51.21]Don't ask me.
[122:56.06]Don't ask me.
[123:03.00]It might be the snake.
[123:03.73]I don't know.
[123:09.70]I'm going to get this game ready.
[123:11.04]Give me like two more minutes.
[123:47.29]Give me an extra two minutes on top of the two minutes.
[123:49.59]I'll be right back.
[123:52.80]This is like something's all borked up over here.
[123:54.66]Hold on.
[124:10.19]I'm so sorry.
[124:11.11]I'm so sorry that happened.
[124:12.19]Every game is loud.
[124:13.01]I'm so fucking sorry.
[124:15.77]That was so goddamn loud.
[124:17.15]Give me a hold on.
[124:22.31]Okay, by the way, I'm going to see a lot of what faces because this is just what face.
[124:27.55]Look at this lady's face.
[124:32.18]That's just the female what face.
[124:35.14]Alright, I'll be right back.
[126:19.15]What's in this little bag?
[126:20.29]What do we got in here?
[126:21.85]Is that a fucking chicken dinner?
[126:27.13]It is.
[126:30.57]Nice.
[126:30.91]I have like a whole fucking chicken dinner right here.
[126:34.52]Oh my god.
[126:35.08]Okay, this is gonna be hard because I'm gonna like eat dinner and play this game.
[126:39.54]Should I just turn on social eating and play a scary game?
[126:45.70]How does that work?
[126:51.45]Social eating scary game.
[126:54.77]No, this is, this is, this is going to be good.
[126:56.97]This is like, I think this is enchiladas.
[126:59.87]Damn.
[127:01.05]Hold on.
[127:01.41]Let's take a look.
[127:02.17]Alright, let's do that.
[127:03.89]Is anybody like here, like don't like when people eat on stream?
[127:08.71]By the way, somebody gave me $50 five minutes ago.
[127:12.96]Black Eagle 1250.
[127:13.76]Thanks for the 50 fucking bucks.
[127:15.64]And they say, no one tell them.
[127:17.18]I don't, well, I don't know what it was.
[127:20.61]Anyways, thank you to Mad Ninja for your $2.
[127:26.09]Your cat threw up.
[127:26.89]What do you do?
[127:28.17]Some cats puke sometimes if they eat too much, eat too fast.
[127:31.24]Just, you know, mix a little bit of dry food in with the wet food and don't give them so much food.
[127:36.48]People feed their pets a little too much.
[127:38.42]Look at the guidelines on the back of the bag.
[127:39.84]It'll tell you exactly how much you should be feeding your pet.
[127:42.70]Dogs, 20 to 25 pounds, you know, should get like a cup of food a day, maybe a cup and a half.
[127:48.37]It's on the back.
[127:48.89]Just read the guidelines and your pet will be okay.
[127:51.39]Thank you.
[127:53.65]Thank you for...
[127:56.50]Somebody else gave some money.
[127:57.38]Garth Brooks gave $5.
[127:58.82]Thanks, Garth Brooks.
[127:59.56]Your music is terrible.
[128:01.55]But love your stream, Jerma.
[128:03.01]It's the most patriotic, God-living stream on Murph Twitch.
[128:06.23]Your music's pretty good.
[128:06.97]It's okay.
[128:07.57]I'm not a fan.
[128:08.51]I don't like it.
[128:11.95]Don't tell Vinny.
[128:12.85]What is going on right now?
[128:21.47]I don't know.
[128:21.85]What is happening?
[128:23.01]Thanks, the dude.
[128:26.80]Watch the shit game for two hours to watch another shit game.
[128:30.70]You love Garth Brooks.
[128:31.40]I don't hate Garth Brooks.
[128:32.62]I don't find his music to be worth listening to.
[128:35.14]For me.
[128:35.68]Me personally.
[128:37.63]This game is going to be fucking loud.
[128:39.53]Let's give it a try.
[128:40.99]I need my facecam.
[128:41.89]Sorry this is taking like a million years.
[128:43.27]I'm not going to play this game.
[128:44.93]I'm going to play this game as long as it takes me to eat the dinner on stream.
[128:49.94]There you go.
[128:52.08]Take that for what you will.
[128:54.60]Plus, I look like shit today.
[128:57.34]I look really ugly.
[129:00.81]I don't look good.
[129:03.27]How am I going to eat enchiladas and stream a fucking video game?
[129:07.87]It's not even possible.
[129:14.47]Enchiladas are messy.
[129:15.83]You can't pick them up.
[129:16.57]It's not like a finger food.
[129:17.41]It's not like a hot dog.
[129:21.75]I'm going to get this all over me.
[129:26.21]What the hell is this plugged into?
[129:28.09]Get rid of it.
[129:32.67]Okay.
[129:37.31]Let's get this up on the screen here and see what this looks like.
[129:40.13]Let's see how fucking bad we look.
[129:41.43]Let's see.
[129:48.43]Hey!
[129:51.13]Holy shit, I'm like... Where's this going?
[129:55.85]Nice, like, pompadour chicken hair.
[129:57.25]I mean, like, always.
[130:01.35]Just going down here.
[130:02.19]Oh, my hair is bad today.
[130:04.78]Real bad.
[130:12.10]What is this hair?
[130:12.82]This is like Cogsworth's hair from the fucking Beauty and the Beast.
[130:17.77]By the way, this t-shirt, I don't know who this company is.
[130:20.00]I got this at PAX.
[130:20.94]I got this fucking at PAX East.
[130:23.70]I don't support this company.
[130:26.04]But there you go.
[130:26.68]Play Advanced.
[130:28.34]They could sell drugs and I would not even fucking know.
[130:30.48]I swear to God.
[130:30.96]Alright, let's move this down here.
[130:35.65]No, you go over this way.
[130:39.29]I just gave a company a shoutout and I have no idea who they are.
[130:43.45]Something tells me that's a bad idea.
[130:52.50]Like that.
[130:53.98]Yeah, yeah.
[130:54.50]Let's get my nice, like, twirly, like, oily chicken hair in the right spot.
[131:01.24]Okay.
[131:01.64]And let's eat.
[131:09.37]Okay.
[131:10.45]We're going to change the lighting in here, too.
[131:12.82]I don't like it.
[131:15.56]I don't like it.
[131:19.90]This suddenly became the best stream ever.
[131:21.76]Why?
[131:25.38]Hope this isn't too loud.
[131:26.64]Let's get my headphone back in.
[131:28.44]Show the food.
[131:28.94]I gotta take it out first.
[131:30.36]Hold on.
[131:32.52]I got a sweaty face.
[131:33.62]I'm sure I do.
[131:35.30]Don't worry.
[131:35.58]I'm aware.
[131:38.33]So we got until I'm done eating my dinner.
[131:39.99]I'm getting real fucking scary now.
[131:47.13]Okay.
[131:48.49]Okay.
[131:50.93]You move over here.
[131:51.74]I don't like you there.
[131:53.36]Stay there.
[131:56.08]Like, I wasn't prepared to do a facecam, guys.
[131:57.60]I really wasn't.
[132:01.70]You think I had, like, this in the cards, you were wrong.
[132:07.63]And why is this, like, it's, like, reversed?
[132:09.43]I don't know.
[132:11.21]Fuck it.
[132:11.47]Who cares?
[132:11.83]Let's eat.
[132:20.12]How do I get the game going?
[132:22.02]I forget how to do that.
[132:26.18]I'm turning into Dennis Reynolds.
[132:30.22]He's cool.
[132:31.08]He's a nice guy.
[132:32.12]He's not a nice guy.
[132:32.88]He's a bad guy.
[132:35.74]Alright, I need to open this.
[132:37.18]I can't see anything anymore, by the way, guys.
[132:39.00]Okay, here we go.
[132:39.56]Let's show you what I got.
[132:41.18]This is like, I don't know if you can see, this is a full enchilada dinner.
[132:54.21]Is there a whole onion in here?
[132:57.81]I'm not going to be able to play this game while I eat this.
[133:00.99]This is actually going to be really interesting.
[133:03.35]Oh, this is salsa.
[133:04.05]Okay.
[133:04.29]It says thank you, thank you, thank you.
[133:09.75]Here, take a look.
[133:12.69]Watch it fucking cascade down.
[133:14.19]Yeah, I got a whole onion too.
[133:19.69]What's in here?
[133:20.07]Alright, new game.
[133:25.60]Is this wicked loud?
[133:31.44]I think it is loud.
[133:32.13]What is this?
[133:34.17]Chipperinos.
[133:34.69]I need a fork.
[133:51.42]I need a fork.
[133:51.96]Give me one second.
[133:53.02]I gotta go get a fork.
[133:57.41]Got to get a fork.
[133:58.09]Be right back.
[135:15.62]Alright, this room smells like diarrhea.
[135:20.46]Like, I'm going to be honest with you right now.
[135:22.30]This room smells like somebody pooed in the room.
[135:28.25]Alright, here we go.
[135:28.87]Get our fork.
[135:31.09]How do I play this game?
[135:34.41]Alright, here we go.
[135:38.39]Let's play perception.
[135:40.85]Ow, my ears.
[135:42.76]When you're blind, you learn a thing or two about trust.
[135:45.96]Nice.
[135:46.40]Yeah.
[135:46.88]Trust.
[135:47.78]You learn who to trust.
[135:49.30]This is a famous actress.
[135:56.75]You learn what?
[135:57.77]I'm watching a fucking movie right now.
[136:00.99]What's this sound?
[136:04.41]A fan.
[136:04.71]Good.
[136:05.27]Good.
[136:08.25]What's in front of the van?
[136:09.79]I don't know.
[136:11.37]Cassie, sounds are how we see.
[136:15.43]Listen, tap your can.
[136:23.58]It's a coffee mug.
[136:26.28]Excellent.
[136:26.80]Though you are without sight, that does not mean you cannot see.
[136:34.45]These are good.
[136:34.83]Oh!
[136:34.99]Boston!
[136:35.31]Boston!
[136:36.05]It was food down my throat.
[136:37.27]It was food stuffed down my throat.
[136:38.90]That's why that sounded like shit.
[137:07.63]Oh, that was bad.
[137:08.67]That was real bad.
[137:09.79]I can't fucking, it's like, this is a fucking dinner.
[137:22.16]So I have to, like, burp to, like, see shit in front of me?
[137:28.88]This is good.
[137:44.77]If somebody just said I look like Herman Munster, then it's fucking causing me anxiety.
[137:53.30]Oh my god, this is fucking too much.
[137:56.34]It's going off.
[137:57.06]I can't fucking do it.
[138:10.91]Hold on a second, let me just fucking get this correct.
[138:14.95]You look like Herman Munster.
[138:17.85]Oh my fucking god, that's so funny.
[138:20.82]That is like the fucking best insult I've ever heard.
[138:23.36]Oh my god.
[138:25.24]That was fucking hilarious.
[138:41.61]I can't play this game and eat.
[138:43.29]It's not possible.
[138:44.21]This isn't like fucking Hearthstone, okay?
[138:47.43]You want a fucking Hearthstone streamer, go watch Hearthstone.
[138:51.17]It's in the top 10.
[138:54.00]We're in the bottom 20 percentile on twitch.tv, okay?
[138:58.42]Oh, it's fine.
[139:12.70]Come on.
[139:17.59]Come on.
[139:20.07]What did I do?
[139:21.61]Oh my god, I didn't even do anything.
[139:24.01]Graphics medium, excuse me.
[139:25.47]We have a fucking 1080 now.
[139:32.06]Okay, that's good.
[139:36.62]Audio, let's get that game volume dropped just a little bit.
[139:39.51]Like, that's good.
[139:44.60]There we are.
[139:45.12]Alright, let me take one more bite.
[139:56.96]Where's the Herman Munster can?
[139:59.42]Oh my god, that's fucking hilarious to me.
[140:04.05]Oh, that's so funny.
[140:04.97]I really do look like Herman Munster right now.
[140:13.48]I could be Herman Munster for Halloween and I would kill it.
[140:15.92]Ew, fucking gross.
[140:18.00]Get some fucking manners.
[140:19.17]Alright, here we go.
[140:26.03]Get this thing in the right spot.
[140:29.56]Okay.
[140:32.14]Close that.
[141:01.65]How am I blind, by the way?
[141:03.49]I can see real well.
[141:06.73]Is this just Gone Home?
[141:08.60]I remember this shit from Gone Home.
[141:11.88]Sorry, just, like, blow some gas out.
[141:15.82]You'll see, like, ten feet in front of you.
[141:17.16]That was kind of scary.
[141:32.73]Am I a person or am I a fucking bat?
[141:36.60]I guess I'm a bat.
[141:45.62]That wasn't scary.
[141:48.26]Deep breaths, Cassie.
[141:50.26]You're here for a reason.
[141:53.29]In my dreams, I always see a rope, a ticket, an apple, and an axe.
[142:00.51]Maybe start there.
[142:05.27]That wasn't scary.
[142:06.31]I mean, that was a little odd.
[142:08.97]That was a little strange.
[142:09.91]It was abnormal, but it wasn't scary.
[142:11.59]Okay, you guys can see the game, right?
[142:17.45]Okay, good.
[142:24.90]Herman fucking Munster.
[142:26.98]Oh, I can't wait to like... I'm going to be Herman Munster for Halloween this year.
[142:36.37]The book.
[142:37.73]Okay.
[142:37.91]PlayElectronics.com!
[143:10.40]PlayAdvanced.org!
[143:11.41]You can just spam this.
[143:30.58]Streamer's gonna eat like fucking real jalapeños?
[143:33.92]Fresh jalapeños on stream?
[143:36.04]No way!
[143:38.60]Oh, whoa!
[143:40.26]Whoa, my God, it hurts!
[143:43.25]Whoa!
[143:44.35]Whoa, crazy!
[143:46.23]Crazy strip!
[143:47.05]That actually kind of sucks.
[143:52.00]Have I gotten to a point where I'm so bored right now that I have to do that?
[144:11.55]Holy shit, he did it.
[144:17.26]What am I supposed to be doing right now?
[144:23.56]I wasn't paying any attention at all.
[144:28.69]Eat a raw what?
[144:29.39]I don't even know what the hell that is.
[144:37.49]This door is locked, right?
[144:38.97]Okay.
[144:40.75]Yeah, it is.
[144:46.55]How much did this game cost for you to wear your space bar out faster?
[144:49.49]It's actually true.
[145:02.96]Jesus Christ!
[145:06.10]You really do clank around.
[145:30.97]It's supposed to be scaring me right now, but I'm not taking it seriously.
[145:33.55]I owe you an Advil?
[145:51.71]Why?
[145:52.95]What did I do?
[145:58.12]I don't like eating on... Why do people like to do this?
[146:00.60]Why do people do this?
[146:03.56]Why do people do this shit?
[146:05.05]I don't want you to watch me eat like fucking chimichangas.
[146:08.73]I need the music box to help me fall asleep.
[146:14.71]It's a new house.
[146:17.43]I'm scared to go.
[146:23.16]But I love this song.
[146:29.62]But that face came back on now.
[146:31.54]I want to bring this into a movie theater.
[146:41.60]I wish I'd left that one.
[146:50.59]There you go.
[146:51.11]It's back on.
[146:51.61]Everybody calm down.
[146:52.51]Everybody can stop freaking out now.
[147:08.17]Everybody close your eyes.
[147:10.03]Close your eyes.
[147:10.57]This is just what you hear when you go into like a youth basketball court.
[147:16.34]You know when there's like, like fucking 10 basketball games going on at the same time?
[147:20.72]And it's like there's like fucking 30 teams playing at the exact same time.
[147:25.27]And it sucks and like you want to get out as soon as possible.
[147:27.17]It's like horrible to listen to.
[147:32.57]I got the rope.
[147:35.27]Whoa!
[147:39.15]Get that coffee.
[147:41.81]Yeah.
[148:11.77]Jesus, that's loud.
[148:12.75]King bed.
[148:13.11]That's pretty nice.
[148:15.49]I can sprint now.
[148:17.13]I've read a book on how to run.
[148:46.50]That really is a basketball game.
[148:53.03]Larry Bird.
[148:53.67]I don't know what the fuck is going on right now.
[149:04.60]I'm not treating this game seriously like I should be.
[149:14.92]Oh no, fresh, fresh frost.
[149:16.66]I feel like I'm going through this very quickly.
[149:33.93]We're missing all the scary parts because I'm going too fast.
[149:36.66]Honey, can you grab the pills you prescribed me for morning sickness?
[149:42.52]I left my purse in the car.
[149:49.37]That way.
[149:57.87]He's not even chasing me.
[150:35.95]Alright, now where?
[150:40.68]This is going to actually give me a headache.
[150:44.26]That leg.
[150:44.82]Boom!
[150:45.96]Boom!
[150:57.47]Hit him with the stick.
[151:00.01]I can't take the stick.
[151:00.85]I need to go up there.
[151:03.97]What the fuck?
[151:04.47]Is there a microphone in there?
[151:05.39]What does it want me to do?
[151:06.33]I'm going for a ride, apparently.
[151:09.97]I have like a scanning device.
[151:29.16]I've been quiet, by the way.
[151:32.69]Why have I been so quiet?
[151:33.51]Because I'm trying to eat.
[151:35.17]Patient.
[151:35.91]Breyer.
[151:36.63]Galicia.
[151:38.27]20 milligrams Fluxodine.
[151:40.09]Tabs.
[151:41.37]Instructions.
[151:42.41]Take twice daily with water.
[151:45.37]Dr. Richard Breyer.
[151:48.97]Was it Richard Breyer?
[151:51.60]Like the famous comedian?
[151:55.40]Dr. Richard Breyer.
[151:59.98]I would listen to Richard Breyer.
[152:12.23]So guys, I just want to make sure you're aware of this.
[152:15.68]We left the car crash game for this.
[152:20.72]How bad do you feel about that decision?
[152:23.38]I need answers.
[152:25.36]I just got here and this shit's messed up.
[152:29.72]I'm onto something.
[152:31.94]And I'm starting to think I'm having these nightmares for a reason.
[152:36.77]Message sent.
[152:39.78]Pick up some potatoes?
[152:40.62]No.
[152:41.96]Slide down the railing?
[152:53.00]I'm not being fair to this game, by the way, guys.
[152:54.82]Not at all.
[153:04.74]I'm not being fair.
[153:05.95]I'm being very unfair.
[153:16.15]I want to see that monster again though.
[153:17.76]I don't know where the radio is coming from.
[153:26.96]Got it.
[153:48.44]Give me the code right here.
[153:49.36]But the amount of fucking streamers watching right now.
[155:14.18]Thanks everybody for watching.
[155:18.82]Thanks everybody.
[155:36.49]Wait, we're not done.
[155:37.39]You thought it was over.
[155:42.68]You thought it was over.
[155:45.22]Huh.
[155:46.40]Oh, wow.
[155:46.80]He's done streaming.
[155:48.02]Nope.
[155:51.44]Got ya.
[155:52.58]We're not done yet.
[155:57.66]I'm gonna give you an Easter egg.
[156:01.38]I'm gonna do this.
[156:14.64]You guys are going to get an Easter egg stream, right?
[156:21.41]God damn it.
[156:24.63]I should have been downloading this once when I fucking said that dumb joke.
[156:32.97]Are you ready for your Easter egg stream?
[156:36.90]Oh, here.
[156:41.98]Fucking never mind.
[156:44.55]I was gonna play NBA 2K15, but it's a fucking 60 gig file.
[156:52.18]So never mind.
[156:52.92]Uh, yeah.
[156:58.78]That wouldn't stream like this.
[157:01.48]Uh, one sec, let me... Oops.
[157:07.79]I was gonna play like one full game of NBA.
[157:12.13]But yeah.
[157:13.97]I didn't... I was not fair at all to this game.
[157:16.07]Like, at all.
[157:17.09]This game deserves, like, another chance.
[157:19.86]But not tonight.
[157:20.96]Because I... I gotta eat my fucking chimichangas, man.
[157:23.76]They're getting greasy and... They're getting slimy.
[157:29.06]Anyways, uh... Thanks for sticking around.
[157:39.58]We got, um...
[157:42.88]We got some stuff going on on Thursday.
[157:46.22]It's gonna be... Friday night's gonna be an IRL stream.
[157:50.59]Friday's gonna be IRL.
[157:52.57]I've been something stupid I've been working on.
[157:54.07]Hopefully you guys think it's funny.
[157:55.57]And if you don't, then, like, my fucking career is over.
[158:01.79]No.
[158:02.13]Good night, guys.
[158:02.85]Thanks for playing.
[158:03.68]Thanks for playing.
[158:04.10]You didn't play anything.
[158:04.78]I played and you watched me crash fucking cars for two and a half hours.
[158:09.79]But anyways, have a good night.
[158:12.13]See you all on Thursday.
[158:16.00]Something special coming on Friday, I promise.
[158:18.76]And I've promised you things before and I always let you down.
[158:21.18]But not this time.
[158:21.76]I'm not going to let you down this time.
[158:22.82]Except I probably will.
[158:25.28]Have a good night, guys.
[158:26.92]Thanks for sticking around.
[158:29.24]And also thank you to Slade7 for the 1500 bits.
[158:32.82]Again with a single earbud.
[158:33.96]I have to have a single earbud.
[158:35.06]I have to.
[158:37.75]I'm a fucking weirdo.
[158:39.85]Gundad, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[158:41.05]They don't say anything.
[158:41.67]They just said cheer 10 bucks.
[158:43.55]Thanks a lot, man.
[158:44.39]Thanks for the $10.
[158:46.97]Mad Ninja, again with $2, says, what's a perception?
[158:50.77]It's when you perceive something.
[158:54.47]It's me, Lum, gave $4 a little while ago.
[158:57.67]The game was so boring, I started playing Solitaire on my computer.
[159:00.30]Please stop.
[159:02.44]Well, I did.
[159:03.76]I did like an hour after you said that.
[159:06.40]But thank you.
[159:09.33]Big Marsh also gave $5 a little while ago.
[159:11.75]Thanks, Big Marsh.
[159:13.19]Grizzly1620 gave $4 as well.
[159:15.40]Give us a poll whether we should go to the next game or not.
[159:23.56]Maybe.
[159:26.06]But, yeah, I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[159:28.28]Much love.
[159:29.42]Hopefully a little short today, but it's okay.
[159:32.58]Sometimes this is what we do over here.
[159:34.28]We go really short and then we go really long.
[159:38.48]Like, my stream on Friday was, like, five hours.
[159:42.97]And my stream tonight's, like, not even three.
[159:45.19]We're all over the place.
[159:46.91]But good night, everybody.
[159:49.83]Take care.
[160:11.50]Thank you.
