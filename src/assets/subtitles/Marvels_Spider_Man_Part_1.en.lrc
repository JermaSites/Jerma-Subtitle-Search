[02:18.52]You're not allowed to say the game is boring because I haven't played it yet.
[02:21.30]I haven't even pressed X. I have held the controller in my hands.
[02:27.29]This is what we're doing today.
[02:28.55]We're playing Spider-Man.
[02:30.17]And I've been waiting for this game...
[02:32.60]I've been waiting for this game for like a year.

[03:27.26]Tom Clancy presents Insomniac presents Spider-Man.
[03:31.74]With help from Sid Meier.
[03:34.76]Amazing, friendly, or spectacular?
[03:36.48]Friendly.
[03:36.87]This setting is for players who want to enjoy the story without challenging.
[03:40.01]No.
[03:40.83]This setting is for players who like a balanced experience with some challenge.
[03:43.81]This setting is for players who enjoy challenging combat and needs to be stronger.
[03:46.49]We're going right for the middle road.
[03:49.33]Now, too far this way, too far that way can cause some problems.
[03:53.44]We're going right down the middle.
[03:54.98]Isn't that interesting?
[04:01.67]Can I change it halfway through?
[04:02.91]I'm not doing spectacular.
[04:07.39]I'm not doing friendly.
[04:08.17]I'm not doing spectacular.
[04:09.11]We can change it in the options.
[04:13.07]Invert up and down.
[04:13.83]Off home theater.
[04:17.21]What?
[04:17.71]Television headphones.
[04:19.85]No.
[04:20.21]Where's mono?
[04:21.65]I only have one headphone in.
[04:24.50]Narrow dynamic range for television only speakers.
[04:26.80]That sounds pretty good.
[04:30.08]Why would I turn invert on?
[04:36.83]Television, right?
[04:37.57]I'm not putting invert on.
[04:41.75]No.
[04:42.37]Television off.
[04:47.25]Subtitles are going to be on.
[04:47.97]Yeah, that's about my headphones, but I don't... This is for you guys, because it's going to sound weird for you, because I only have one headphone.
[04:55.69]Inverted spectacular television.
[04:57.36]No, we're going to have subtitles on.
[05:00.82]That's good.
[05:01.52]Okay.
[05:02.18]Continue.
[05:05.01]Uh, is this disable parallaxing?
[05:09.39]Subtitle in the background.
[05:10.73]I think we don't need to do any big subtitles.
[05:13.49]No, you guys can read.
[05:14.29]You guys are good.
[05:14.75]Let's just go.
[05:20.58]I'm ready.
[05:22.08]Spider-Man.
[05:23.32]It's my favorite character.
[05:26.88]I can't wait to hear the voices.
[05:28.80]There's probably great acting in here.
[05:33.24]Skip puzzles this puzzles in this game Oh, is my actual real favorite marvel superhero supervillain in this game don't spoil that don't spoil it for me, but is he in it?
[05:55.27]Does it do the whole history does it get bit

[06:23.05]I was too fast.
[06:23.79]Is that Norman Osborn?
[06:29.51]Let's see your doodles.
[06:30.69]You think I kept my high school notebook?
[06:34.71]Actually, it's kind of funny you said that.
[06:35.71]It might be somewhere.
[06:38.25]My high school notebook might be just in my, like, parents' house somewhere.
[06:45.49]Rhinos, Rampage, Vultures, Squawks.
[06:51.37]Okay, here we go.
[06:54.67]Fisk Tower.
[06:55.53]Fisk.
[07:05.27]Whoa!
[07:06.53]That's the biggest superhero move I've seen.
[07:08.31]He doesn't wash his clothes?
[07:13.67]Oh, there's the Fitbits.
[07:14.83]The Spider-Man Fitbits.
[07:15.95]I get it.

[07:30.18]No.
[07:34.64]So how long have we been Spider-Man?

[07:39.88]I'm going to get evicted.
[07:45.21]This is it.
[07:46.43]This is the part that everybody was talking about.
[07:48.09]I got to get the swing around New York.
[07:53.83]Here we go.
[07:54.13]It's going to seamlessly go into a cutscene.
[08:00.89]Any second now.
[08:03.28]Any minute now, we're going to seamlessly go out of the cutscene.
[08:07.36]New powers here, look.
[08:10.14]Levitation?
[08:10.94]He might have learned that from Doctor Strange.
[08:13.85]This is fucking awesome.
[08:16.89]Wow.
[08:27.19]Swing it around, New York, baby!
[08:36.18]While holding, press X to jump and gain speed.
[08:41.94]Can I grab onto the helicopter?
[08:46.64]Yeah, this feels great.
[08:47.32]This is so cool.
[08:47.93]I can't believe we took him this long to simply make one of these.
[08:49.95]You guys really gonna puke?
[08:50.89]I think I'm gonna puke.
[09:05.63]I think I'm gonna puke.
[09:07.49]I don't think I can play this game for more than like 10 minutes.
[09:14.56]I'm just kidding.
[09:15.12]This is fun.
[09:16.64]Alright, 100 times square.
[09:22.46]Web zip is great for maintaining altitude.
[09:24.32]Ooh!
[09:26.19]And for turning in the air.
[09:27.09]Uh, hello?
[09:28.03]Parker, where are you?

[09:31.84]Holy shit, that's ten community subs from Spectac.
[09:34.04]Uh, yes.
[09:35.00]Sorry, yes.

[10:12.85]Bring in the hammer.
[10:13.93]The hammer?
[10:14.45]Who's the hammer?
[10:29.02]That's the Rhino, right?
[10:32.75]That's the Rhino!
[10:34.05]Oh, whoa!
[10:35.27]They redesigned him!
[10:37.01]They've redesigned Rhino!
[10:38.03]He's like a big, bigger guy now!
[10:39.91]Oh, no, he's dead!
[10:40.97]He's dead!
[10:42.57]Okay, well, that was fucking kind of cool.
[10:44.05]That's one boss done.
[10:51.50]Now, here I come in for the kill.
[10:54.78]Alright, here we go.
[10:56.00]Morning.
[10:56.92]Web strike.
[10:58.84]Okay, it's... Your spider sense will flash around your head to warn of incoming attacks when you see this.
[11:03.86]Get ready to dodge!
[11:06.58]Okay, so just like Batman.
[11:09.10]Does triangle work too, or does it always have to be... I guess that's how it works, huh?
[11:16.43]L1, R1?
[11:17.89]What the fuck?
[11:19.85]Okay, that was cool.
[11:24.31]Wow.
[11:26.91]Well, if there was a video game that felt fun to play, this would be it.
[11:29.79]No, I was going to say this is a rhino.
[11:38.08]Oh, there's two rhinos.
[11:41.32]I couldn't do it.
[11:41.82]I'm sorry.
[11:44.60]So you press circle and dodge to dodge to the side.
[11:47.16]Okay, that makes sense.
[11:49.33]Web up enemies is R1.
[11:50.17]Man, Fisk has a lot of guys on his payroll.
[12:02.69]Press X then go to the woman leap off mood.
[12:05.79]Like that.
[12:06.87]Okay.
[12:07.05]This is fucking funny shit, man.
[12:09.22]Oh, I love Spider-Man!
[12:09.86]How long until my energy just drains here?
[12:12.52]What am I doing?
[12:44.25]See, I distracted that guy to a point where I could get a clean kill.
[12:47.55]Here we go.
[12:47.97]That's Times Square.
[12:48.71]So, what happens if I just don't... What happens if I let go?
[12:57.74]Do I just land?
[12:58.22]Can I run?
[13:13.92]Imagine somebody didn't know what spider-man could do you go for the tutorial you just stop running Sounds like reviewers just like spider-man that's kind of cool.
[13:24.08]All right, let's play Just like every other kind of third-person game cool, man, how's it going you can say hello to people Can I run faster
[13:43.42]You go the whole game and then finally somebody one of your co-workers comes up taps you on the shoulder Hey man, have you like pressed R2 the whole game?
[13:49.57]No, try it It just sprints That is sprinting
[14:02.46]Alright, how long can I play the game without being Spider-Man?
[14:04.74]Can I just be a guy in suit that can punch well?
[14:07.66]Yes!
[14:07.82]My title is swinging around New York.
[14:09.72]Swinging.
[14:09.98]Oh, swinging around.
[14:11.24]And I'm just running.
[14:12.44]I don't even use the web.
[14:13.42]Hehehehe.
[14:31.39]Is Spider-Man like Batman?
[14:38.01]Like, does he learn to kill people as Spider-Man?
[14:42.12]Clear the atrium.
[14:42.78]Oh, he can just do that.
[14:48.08]That's cool.
[14:48.38]Alright, let's go!
[14:51.15]Build focus by attacking enemies.
[14:52.57]You do more damage when you have more focus.
[14:55.62]Increase your combo count to gain focus faster.
[14:57.42]Earn bonus focus during air combat.
[14:59.16]Okay, I killed that guy.
[15:00.61]What happened to this guy?
[15:02.69]Whoa!
[15:02.99]That's fucking fun.
[15:04.91]Now my combo meter!
[15:07.51]Quick!
[15:27.08]Whoa, Jesus!
[15:27.98]I gotta use Triangle more often.
[16:01.04]I got a full focus bar.
[16:02.14]That means I can use special moves.
[16:08.26]You can pull back up on people.
[16:09.50]That's so cool.
[16:10.08]Is this a bad?
[16:12.61]Is it a good guy?
[16:13.15]I think that was a good guy.
[16:15.15]Maybe not.
[16:18.19]Use focus to heal.
[16:18.95]The more focus you have, the more you will heal.
[16:22.33]Just down Zip move This is so much fucking fun, dude
[16:49.41]Oh my god.
[16:49.93]I don't even know what I did.
[16:51.79]That was just fun.
[16:52.53]If you focus hard enough, you'll get what?
[16:58.59]He can't do that.
[16:59.91]He doesn't have super strength.
[17:02.52]Does he?
[17:02.86]Yeah, he does.
[17:12.64]Climb the wall.
[17:13.22]See, this is cool.
[17:13.58]I can just run.
[17:14.54]Enter.
[17:14.74]This really did turn out good.
[17:16.42]I'm impressed.
[17:16.90]Yeah, this is... So far, I mean, yeah, this is like the, hey, look at how cool this game is tutorial, but we'll see.
[17:21.07]Can I run in here?
[17:21.77]Okay.
[17:42.50]Do I have to press buttons and comms and metal gear?
[17:45.08]Oh boy, here we go.
[17:45.60]Oh, that was cool.
[17:46.75]You stay up there for a little while, huh?
[18:21.04]He can't even move.
[18:23.78]He can't even move.
[18:24.60]He couldn't even defend himself.
[18:26.86]A full focus bar can be used to perform a finisher that instantly knocks out an enemy.
[18:32.55]How do I do that?
[18:35.15]So you press these two together.
[18:36.59]Oh, okay.
[18:38.15]Do I have to finish it or does it just play it out?
[18:41.45]Okay, well that works.
[18:42.65]Let's do it.
[18:51.88]Oh, I can only do that a few times.
[18:53.12]I can't get it.
[18:54.28]Just to recharge.
[18:57.54]Woof!
[18:58.84]Dude, that was a sick soccer kick.
[19:01.44]This is fucking awesome.
[19:02.56]Uh, come here!
[19:18.55]She's probably healed.
[19:19.65]Do I have to hold it?
[19:21.45]Oh, no.
[19:21.75]I don't have any focus.
[19:24.43]All right, find the server room.
[19:29.73]Okay, so I got a scanner?
[19:34.35]Okay.
[19:38.17]Enter the server room using the sneaky way.
[19:41.83]Like this way.
[19:46.54]Zip into the vent.
[19:50.54]There we go.
[19:50.92]I have to aim it?
[19:54.60]No, that was weird.
[19:58.70]Okay, let's go.
[19:58.98]Spidey scan.
[19:59.36]Wait, what is that?
[19:59.92]Who's Fisk?
[20:00.32]What Spider-Man villain is that?
[20:01.88]Vent takedown.
[20:02.40]Alright, here we go.
[20:19.46]Okay, that guy died.
[20:21.88]That guy's dead.
[20:23.46]You don't survive that.
[20:24.18]He pancaked up on the ceiling.
[20:25.68]There's no way that guy's still alive.
[20:37.24]Anybody else to do that to?
[20:43.75]I went the wrong way?
[20:45.27]How did I go the wrong way?
[20:49.50]How did I do that?
[20:55.45]Was I supposed to drop down or out or through?
[20:58.21]Oh, have I already fucked this up somehow?
[21:05.44]What did I do wrong here?
[21:06.90]Did I already screw this up already?
[21:13.93]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[21:16.97]Lost in a one-way street.
[21:18.43]How did I get so turned around up here?
[21:22.20]What?
[21:24.20]Quick, don't let him near the PS4!
[21:30.86]I'm playing Spider-Man on there!
[21:34.95]I can't believe he actually showed up!
[21:36.49]Uh-oh, I'm dead.
[21:49.06]Hey, I'm good.
[21:51.62]Gotta access that console before everything's gone.
[21:54.84]Access the console.
[21:58.20]Let's see just how good their security is.
[22:00.02]I was in the vents for five minutes.
[22:01.46]I forgot the latest kernel patch.
[22:04.48]Who's that?
[22:09.55]Says the guy frantically erasing his search history.
[22:11.93]After all these years, you are still just an ignorant child.
[22:18.74]Is that supposed to be Kingpin?
[22:20.04]I like that tie.
[22:27.31]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[22:31.03]I don't want to lose any money.
[22:32.33]Air launch.
[22:32.75]Yep.
[22:33.27]Throw me the air.
[22:34.89]Yank enemies.
[22:36.85]What's he trying to tell me to hold?
[22:41.19]I mean...
[22:43.40]Oh, you hold it, okay.
[22:44.24]Assholes.
[22:44.52]Assholes, hey!
[22:44.84]Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
[22:45.58]Okay, not today.
[23:14.16]We're good.
[23:16.32]Anybody else coming in, or does it exit through the front door?
[23:21.87]No, there we go.
[23:22.73]I had to investigate.
[23:24.77]Zip.
[23:24.99]Uh-huh.
[23:26.85]The guy with the guns are the guys who have to take off first.
[23:32.18]Okay, that guy just eluded my body.
[23:36.70]You like the fireworks?
[23:39.40]We got more where that came from.
[23:48.29]Anybody else?
[23:49.25]You still alive?
[23:51.23]Goodbye.
[23:51.49]What, a death counter?
[23:52.71]Why would I put a death counter?
[23:56.90]I haven't died once.
[23:58.14]I like the boys.
[24:01.14]Good actor.
[24:16.25]It's pretty nice verticality in these first levels, by the way.
[24:22.27]Okay, that's a lady.
[24:23.81]Never mind.
[24:24.59]These are all just... Okay, these are random people.
[24:26.11]They're fine.
[24:29.99]I can pull this.
[24:33.35]Oh, God.
[24:33.73]Don't jump scare me like that.
[24:37.12]Any more things I need to drag?
[24:38.32]Any more things to click and drag?
[24:42.80]Over here.
[24:45.43]I got a fire extinguisher.
[24:47.05]That can put it out, right?
[24:48.83]No.
[24:54.01]I just turned around in a circle again.
[24:58.34]I swear to God, guys.
[24:59.84]I swear to God.
[25:02.04]It's the colors.
[25:02.86]It's when the levels are the same color is when I can't do it.
[25:07.45]What am I missing here?
[25:09.54]Oh.
[25:13.10]Okay.
[25:14.44]Never mind.
[25:15.61]Oh, wait.

[26:36.43]I can't do the vents.
[26:37.19]Somebody else has to do the vent levels.
[26:39.55]That's the only thing I can't do.
[26:42.97]Wait, what was that?
[26:48.80]Are we losing frames?
[26:51.04]Oh, great.
[26:53.56]Hey, here's the good thing though.
[26:54.80]Everyone would be really happy there.
[26:56.04]You never have to deal with that again.
[26:57.74]I never have to deal with that ever again in like two weeks.
[27:04.86]Uh-oh, rocket launcher.
[27:05.54]I can grab it from mid-air, right?
[27:11.56]See?

[27:15.60]Is he gonna do it again?
[27:16.78]Okay, I actually have to... I want to grab it from his hand.
[27:21.77]Oh, that doesn't work.
[27:22.57]What?
[27:23.75]Oh, come on.
[27:24.37]Really?

[27:43.19]Anybody else?
[27:46.13]Nope.
[27:47.21]Oh, shit.
[27:47.60]Oh, shit.
[27:47.88]Oh, shit.
[27:48.08]There is somebody else.
[27:48.64]Oh, my God.
[27:48.94]Just do it.
[27:49.26]Just do it.
[27:55.14]Okay.
[27:57.98]Okay.
[27:58.44]Okay.
[27:58.98]Okay.
[27:59.32]Here we go.
[27:59.68]Check this out.
[28:02.97]No one's done that yet.
[28:03.75]I'm the only one that's done it.
[28:04.97]Where is he?
[28:05.51]I'm sorry.
[28:07.96]Where the fuck is this guy?
[28:27.71]Where is he?
[28:32.49]It's like blended in over here.
[28:33.89]Oh, Jesus.
[28:34.55]Okay.
[28:38.07]Oh, yeah.
[28:38.37]I have R3.
[28:38.87]That's right.
[28:44.60]Hello.
[28:44.84]I like to come in.
[28:46.40]I just almost hurt myself.
[28:49.42]Parkour.
[28:50.52]Oh, that was fun.
[28:58.18]I can't jump out the window?
[29:00.34]Why?
[29:01.54]Come on.
[29:01.90]It's Spider-Man.
[29:02.56]I should be able to jump out the window.
[29:04.46]Not deal with this shit.
[29:07.98]Don't attack the fucking statue.
[29:15.05]Dodge onto a wall.
[29:16.27]Okay, you got some really bad times with these tutorial things here.
[29:19.27]Dodge onto a wall and press to perform an off-the-wall attack.
[29:21.83]Alright, hold on.
[29:29.58]I'm gonna die.
[29:39.16]No, I'm not.
[29:40.48]Don't say that.
[29:42.20]Come here.
[29:43.60]Let's heal.
[29:44.42]Bomb squad.
[29:45.31]Am I missing secrets and shit?
[29:46.95]Should I be paying more attention to that?
[29:54.56]That was quite an entrance.
[29:56.12]No secrets?
[29:58.12]I should put my glasses on.
[30:04.63]They're too dirty.
[30:05.23]I can't.
[30:06.05]I knew it.
[30:06.39]I knew the way the guy was talking.
[30:09.27]We're gonna unmask him and it's gonna be the lizard.
[30:14.85]Like, how could I have not known?
[30:16.83]Shield enemies block attacks from the front, but are vulnerable from the back.
[30:23.19]And then you'd go underneath and start fighting.
[30:25.11]Guy with the guns had to go first.
[30:26.53]And web this guy up.
[30:27.47]Whoa!
[30:28.73]You're back alive!
[30:29.39]That was fun.
[31:06.80]Oh, that was cool.
[31:08.18]Finish him!
[31:12.84]Who am I calling now?
[31:17.60]Is she the bad guy?
[31:22.25]Alright.
[31:23.43]Please tell me this is going to be one of those little boss fights where I just have to punch him one time.
[31:31.17]Right?
[31:31.39]Because he's like a big fat guy.
[31:32.49]I don't have any superpowers.
[31:33.46]I just have to slap him and he'll go like, and he'll fall down, right?
[31:47.92]Writing your memoirs?
[31:49.46]Don't forget the hyphen between spider and man.
[31:52.92]I think I'm stupid.
[31:53.44]Get the chopper ready.
[31:54.86]I won't be long.
[31:57.86]See, he's... No, this is gonna be... Look, watch.
[31:59.88]I'm surprised you made it this far.
[32:01.92]Is he Two-Face?
[32:02.52]Was that Harvey Dent before he becomes Two-Face?
[32:05.99]Ends now.
[32:07.43]He's gonna flip the coin and choose... He got fat.
[32:09.71]Holy fuck.
[32:11.75]Well, that wasn't a coin.
[32:14.85]I know it's Kingpin.
[32:21.08]The fight is robots.
[32:25.32]Now, one thing that the game's missing, I think, is every time you swing, it should be like, YAH!
[32:38.03]I'm sorry.
[32:39.01]I'm sorry.
[32:40.05]I'm sorry.
[32:42.01]I'm sorry.
[32:45.22]You gotta give me at least one, right?
[32:46.92]Okay, now.
[32:50.26]Oh, let's see.
[32:55.16]That would get so annoying.
[32:56.18]Oh, I can yank it.
[32:58.28]I see.
[33:02.09]Hold on.
[33:06.04]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[33:09.37]Okay, wait till the next pass.
[33:16.91]No, my machines!
[33:24.69]Five subs from Spectag.
[33:26.31]He's giving a shitload tonight.
[33:27.61]Thank you so much, dude.
[33:29.29]Here we go.
[33:39.76]I told you.
[33:40.34]Oh, never mind.
[33:49.14]It's just a fat guy.
[33:56.23]This is not fair.
[34:03.53]Tiresome annoyance!
[34:14.48]It's a broken hand.
[34:15.38]How?
[34:15.98]How would that make any sense?
[34:17.86]It's Spider-Man.
[34:21.03]Oh, here we go.
[34:21.49]Here comes a real boss fight.
[34:22.59]Ow.
[34:22.67]Okay, I gotta pay attention to him.
[34:46.98]Whoa, he throws shit.
[34:47.92]Okay.
[34:48.42]Okay.
[34:48.68]Pay attention.
[34:50.36]Oh, okay.
[34:50.88]Pay attention.
[34:51.46]Whoa.
[34:52.92]Oh, my God.
[34:54.11]Okay.
[34:54.41]This just turned up.
[34:55.93]Ta-da.
[34:56.47]Dialed.
[34:56.91]This dialed up.
[35:01.81]I can't... Oh, boy.
[35:02.47]I can't swing in here?
[35:07.11]Oh, I'm dead.
[35:08.93]So, R2... You can't swing in here.
[35:14.71]I tried to R2.
[35:20.53]I have to jump first.
[35:22.15]Oh, well, that makes sense.
[35:22.89]Okay.
[35:30.65]Woof!
[35:33.89]How is he beating us?!
[35:35.41]How is he beating us?!
[35:37.05]Ah, fuck!
[35:39.11]I have to, like, web him up first before I do anything.
[35:48.51]Jesus Christ!
[35:52.96]Where the heck are the guns?
[36:02.98]Woah!
[36:03.38]Holy shit!
[36:21.66]Oh my god!
[36:23.20]Oh fuck, this is hard.
[36:29.56]Oof.
[36:34.10]I gotta wrap him up first.
[36:36.50]Immediately.
[36:36.96]You know what?
[36:37.26]Fuck his guards.
[36:37.88]No, what are you doing?
[36:40.74]Get him.
[36:47.11]Holy shit, this is intense for the first level.
[36:54.46]Jesus Christ!
[36:56.22]Alright, hold on.
[36:58.70]Are these guys shooting in here at me?
[37:00.26]And I can't... No.
[37:01.62]That's what's freaking me out.
[37:04.72]Oh my fucking lord.
[37:05.92]Holy shit.
[37:07.20]I'm already dead again.
[37:24.68]Let's go this way.
[37:28.21]He's obviously right fucking where I land.
[37:37.47]Jesus, get away from me, motherfucker!
[37:39.05]Jesus.
[38:01.24]Where are we going?
[38:01.82]Here, this way.
[38:04.70]He just like whips shit.
[38:10.92]Give me this.
[38:15.46]Jesus Christ.
[38:20.71]Oh, don't lose this.
[38:43.49]Give me something over here.
[38:58.18]Woo!
[39:05.21]Yep.
[39:14.70]There we go.
[39:15.24]Nope.
[39:16.41]Don't break my back, please.
[39:17.41]Whoa, what am I doing?
[39:20.91]Okay, I have to wait until he goes in a circle.
[39:27.57]Oh, shit.
[39:28.39]That was... Okay, I have to wait.
[39:30.40]Oh, goddamn QTEs.
[39:32.36]Give him the DDT, quick.
[39:48.68]We did it.
[39:50.88]Alright.
[39:52.04]Turn off?
[39:52.82]You can turn off?
[39:54.62]Alright, that was awesome.
[40:06.09]That was no joke there.
[40:08.33]They don't just go, oh yeah, here, learn how to do the moves.
[40:10.81]Good luck.
[40:13.52]That was cool.
[40:14.06]That was a lot of fun.
[40:21.16]Finally off to Rikers, huh?
[40:22.30]Now to cut his tie off.
[40:22.88]You know, I think you've got more enemies in there than I do.
[40:25.18]If you think this will be more than a minor... It's like Tony Stark.
[40:28.64]That's where he lives in there.
[40:30.36]Good luck, Willie.
[40:31.39]I have a feeling you're gonna need it.
[40:32.73]Idiot!
[40:34.97]I'm the one who kept order in this city!
[40:38.87]One month!
[40:39.93]In one month, you'll wish you had me back!
[40:42.81]You know, he's not wrong.
[40:46.54]The Kingpin is heading to prison.
[40:48.76]End of an era.
[40:52.09]Welcome to Spider-Man, okay.
[40:56.81]So, 4100 experience points.
[40:59.41]Okay, we're good.
[41:03.17]Health increased, plus 1.
[41:04.29]You got, of course, the skill points.
[41:06.37]Of course there's a skill tree.
[41:08.01]Oh, my god, there's a Diablo 2 skill tree.
[41:12.97]Skill points are awarded when you gain enough experience points.
[41:14.71]Press X to continue.
[41:16.37]Complete missions and defeat enemies to get XP and more skill points.
[41:20.19]Innovator, Defender, Web Slinger.
[41:24.54]Hmm.
[41:25.40]Okay.
[41:27.72]Press Circle, Dodge just as your Spider Sense turns blue to counter enemies with a web shot to the face.
[41:35.14]I mean... I feel like this is very useful.
[41:40.44]hold square while in the air to swing kick enemies and send them flying yeah this is the one I didn't even look at the other one what was this in the beehive well trying to grab and throw webbed and electrified enemies they can be tossed into other enemies or walls cool
[42:06.44]I feel like I want this first, though.
[42:08.54]That would come in handy a lot.
[42:11.18]Timing window for perfect dodge.
[42:14.35]Right as an attack lands, generate bonus focus.
[42:16.27]So this is just timing your attacks without mashing.
[42:20.81]So this is a throw move.
[42:21.97]It's a combo.
[42:22.47]You just do punch and then grab.
[42:23.97]Okay, that's also very useful.
[42:29.39]Web zip a second time without losing altitude.
[42:31.33]That's good for travel purposes.
[42:33.63]All these are cool.
[42:37.15]I heard this game really makes you feel like Spider-Man.
[42:40.03]Well, you would be correct.
[42:41.23]Okay.
[42:47.66]My other job, get to work.
[42:53.24]Cool.
[42:56.80]Point launch is icy.
[42:57.88]So I have to actually, is this like a Sims thing where I have to actually get to work?
[43:02.40]I'm almost there.
[43:03.52]Blocks away.
[43:05.93]Sorry.
[43:06.09]I was just feeling like Spider-Man 2 and I didn't do it right.
[43:14.13]The Sims 5.
[43:14.51]The Sims 5.
[43:14.83]Busting out.
[43:34.11]Hold L3.
[43:34.57]Whoa!
[43:40.41]That's so cool.
[43:42.63]You know, the game really needs to be like Spider-Man.
[43:46.64]What about up here?
[43:47.14]Can I just climb?
[43:54.94]OK, I'm just seeing what happens.
[43:55.88]Spider-Man!
[44:03.29]Am I going to use this gameplay footage?
[44:04.57]What if I do this?
[44:07.23]I just scare everybody.
[44:17.64]I got plus five experience.
[44:23.93]I'm just scaring citizens.
[44:28.35]Can I shake somebody's hand?
[44:31.79]That's so funny.
[44:35.15]And... Are you really him?
[44:36.37]Why don't I just demonstrate?
[44:37.93]Oh, ow, oops.
[44:45.92]Right over here.
[44:53.85]Mm-hmm.
[44:54.81]Right here.
[44:56.25]Dive bomb into my office and I'm not even late.
[45:10.94]What do you mean, what I what?
[45:13.44]I'm sorry I'm late.
[45:19.22]Stock octopus?
[45:19.92]You started without me.
[45:26.84]The grant committee's director will be here soon.
[45:28.80]Otto!
[45:33.18]It's fine, Parker.
[45:34.24]I invented this equipment.
[45:35.35]I think I can handle it.
[45:37.52]It's funny how they all say that right before they turn into a monster.
[45:42.54]I'm waiting for somebody to actually be able to handle it.
[45:48.48]I know my own equipment.
[45:49.42]I think I can handle this.
[45:50.24]As long as I wasn't late.
[45:52.15]Stop!
[46:06.58]Are you okay?
[46:08.08]Another setback.
[46:15.17]Is he wearing a seatbelt?
[46:16.49]But we're close.
[46:19.07]He is.
[46:19.79]He's got a seatbelt on.
[46:26.85]Is anyone hurt?
[46:27.61]No, it was all my fault.
[46:29.03]The energy levels exceeded our expectations.
[46:32.89]From a certain viewpoint, that's a very positive development.
[46:35.41]That's not my hairline.
[46:36.53]Let me break.
[46:38.33]I assure you, in the next phase... Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[46:41.44]Oh, is it?
[46:42.68]It is, isn't it, huh?
[46:43.96]Is there somewhere else we can discuss this?
[46:48.17]Maybe you should take the rest of the day off, Peter.
[46:50.75]But we'll talk later.
[47:00.46]I have Spider-Man's hairline.
[47:01.76]Yeah, it's wonderful.
[47:02.72]I actually have to work.
[47:04.58]Test the arm.
[47:05.28]Ooh, it's like a drone.
[47:07.50]This thing sucks.
[47:34.61]Let's see what's wrong with you.
[47:41.89]Steam controller.
[47:45.41]Octavia... This is a puzzle.
[47:46.49]Here we go.
[47:46.87]This is why Skip Puzzles was in this.
[47:53.57]Diagnostic test report following.
[47:55.77]Servo control power... Damage.
[47:57.87]Connect servo motor.
[47:58.85]Power motor.
[48:01.47]Oh no.
[48:04.56]If I had been here to do the pre-check, I would have caught this.
[48:08.60]Power control for the armor is damaged.
[48:10.02]Well, if you see this, that means you're going to see it another hundred times.
[48:13.43]Create a connection between the green start pipe and the orange end piece.
[48:17.55]Okay.
[48:20.93]How do I rotate?
[48:31.16]I can't pick it up.
[48:34.69]Why can I not move?
[48:35.25]Why are these locked?
[48:41.00]Oh.
[48:42.10]Okay.
[48:43.46]Now I get it.
[48:46.04]So I have to go from here to there.
[48:47.40]I thought I could move these around, but I can't.
[48:50.52]Alright, let's go.
[48:53.51]I need to... Can I move this?
[48:57.33]Yes, I can.
[48:57.93]Okay, cool.
[49:00.03]Put another one there.
[49:09.99]No, it's not that one.
[49:11.01]Maybe that one is this one.
[49:17.24]Do I get an arm now?
[49:24.76]No, not again.
[49:27.93]Some circuit pieces only allow connections from specific directions.
[49:32.54]Right.
[49:33.02]Okay.
[49:33.70]So.
[49:34.44]That makes... Okay.
[49:35.30]I see them on there.
[49:36.76]This... We gotta go down.
[49:40.62]Can I go like this?
[49:41.88]No.
[49:42.00]It has to go like that.
[49:44.90]I can do just down.
[49:45.82]I can do down again.
[49:48.34]But no.
[49:48.58]It has to come through there.
[49:49.46]That's not gonna work.
[49:50.66]So we have to eventually go through here.
[49:53.75]And then down.
[49:54.15]Let's just build it backwards.
[49:58.03]No.
[49:58.27]That's not it.
[50:00.71]This one can do it.
[50:05.63]No.
[50:08.61]That one will do it.
[50:10.29]And that does it.
[50:10.91]Alright, so then I go from here.
[50:12.17]This one does not belong here.
[50:16.96]Nope.
[50:17.30]Stay alone.
[50:20.78]Okay.
[50:26.48]Okay.
[50:29.06]And that should be it, right?
[50:30.48]Yes, it is.
[50:30.92]Okay.
[50:35.48]Have to do that again.
[50:37.38]Now rebalance the voltage.
[50:41.36]Turn on skip mode.
[50:46.36]How often do I actually have to do these though?
[50:50.14]Set the power volts, you must also meet its charge requirement.
[50:54.96]Some circuit pieces provide a positive or negative charge.
[51:00.62]Okay.
[51:02.39]So I need to meet the charge requirement.
[51:05.28]This has to be positive.
[51:07.14]This has to be negative.
[51:08.36]This also has to be positive.
[51:09.50]Okay, that's it.
[51:17.45]No.
[51:18.07]That's not it.
[51:20.27]I need more power.
[51:26.29]Alright.
[51:30.13]I don't think I need to turn that off.
[51:35.62]I mean, you are going to fall asleep during that, but it works the brain a little bit.
[51:41.40]Let's see if that worked.
[51:44.14]It also extends the game an extra, like, probably two hours.
[51:49.29]Now let's try.
[51:50.13]Can I extend the arm?
[52:04.04]All right.
[52:04.92]Twitch plays robot.
[52:06.40]Twitch plays robot.
[52:07.21]Come on, guys.
[52:07.61]Let's see it.
[52:31.31]Hey, hey, hey.
[52:32.58]Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[52:35.12]No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't turn it off!
[52:37.22]Hey!
[52:45.81]Doc's been testing new materials for the prosthetics.
[52:49.09]He asked me to review his work if I had time.
[52:50.67]Circuit projects are now available in the lab.
[52:52.51]I probably won't be doing very many of these.
[53:00.31]Was that Windex?
[53:00.89]Can I clean the window with Windex?
[53:03.76]Use spectrograph.
[53:04.68]Oh, is there another one of these?
[53:08.92]Unknown substance spawn.
[53:10.14]Oh, there's more of this shit.
[53:14.44]Your goal is to identify the unknown substance by its absorption spectrum.
[53:21.92]Use fragments of the unknown substance and try to match up the absorption lines in the spectrum.
[53:28.07]Press L to move your cursor.
[53:28.93]Press X to line up a fragment.
[53:31.07]Press X to pick up a fragment.
[53:33.73]Okay.
[53:34.61]Well, this one has three.
[53:36.65]Place the fragment into an available slot and try to match the absorption lines.
[53:42.80]This is obviously fairly easy.
[53:44.84]For now.
[53:45.92]I'm going to do it.
[53:52.36]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[53:54.91]Peter.
[53:55.11]Peter.
[53:55.23]Peter.
[53:55.37]Don't tell Harry.
[53:55.91]Okay, I did it.
[53:57.05]Substance found.
[53:57.59]Do I get points for this?
[53:58.11]I'm just... I'm curious of what I need to expect.
[54:00.05]Should I?
[54:00.27]No.
[54:00.53]I'll come back to this later.
[54:01.69]I'll come back to this later during my 100% completion of the game.
[54:09.30]Let's go.
[54:26.26]You know how much I sacrificed?
[54:35.06]I missed a secret?
[54:35.76]God damn it, did I?
[54:41.71]There's an experience bonus for doing them all.
[54:44.31]I would imagine.
[54:49.87]My other job, earn 250 experience.
[54:50.89]Cool.
[54:55.18]Ring.
[54:55.38]You're going to annoy this person in this apartment.
[54:57.69]Put bird shit all over my window.
[55:00.85]That's right, it's bird shit.
[55:02.13]That's cool.
[55:02.57]You thought I was going to go, didn't you?
[55:24.78]Huh.
[55:25.48]Looks like Jameson's got a new episode out.
[55:27.42]I wonder what my number one fan thinks about the Fisk takedown.
[55:32.38]Mm-hmm.
[55:34.86]This is Just the Facts with J. Jonah Jameson.
[55:37.77]Whoa.
[55:38.87]Oh, that would be so... I don't know.
[55:43.49]I could not handle doing that.
[55:44.71]...former publisher of the Daily Bugle.
[55:46.41]Hey, plug the book.
[55:47.59]End.
[55:48.86]And as always, if you order Mr. Jameson's book, Spider-Man, Threat or Menace, within 24 hours of our broadcast, you'll get an autographed copy at no extra charge.
[56:01.18]Welcome to Just the Facts with J. Jonah Jameson.
[56:04.67]So, you know when you drive around in GTA, and it's just the most relaxing thing ever?
[56:10.95]It's kind of like that.
[56:16.80]Remember if you keep with the title everyone's like what the fuck is your title?
[56:21.19]This is just adds to every review of this game.
[56:22.81]You said award-winning reporter The first paragraph has one of those lines in this game That's just every single review and that's how I feel too Let's do a dive bomb
[56:41.83]We're going to have a game on the street.
[56:43.79]But does that web-headed moron give a damn?
[56:46.25]Of course not.
[56:47.51]He got on TV.
[56:48.45]He makes you feel like Spider-Man.
[56:51.61]Yeah, well, I can get copper pipes without paying kickbacks now.
[56:54.51]Want to go up on the building?
[56:55.93]I'm on the webhead side.
[56:57.66]And you'll be singing a different tune when three new mobs are lining up to charge you triple for that same punch.
[57:02.26]This is really going to fucking freak him out.
[57:03.46]Or just break your legs.
[57:05.20]I have to bird shit at least like four people's windows.
[57:07.14]You know what I mean?
[57:08.62]Let me get you to say something nice about me.
[57:14.77]Hacking minigame?
[57:15.61]No, not another one.
[57:16.51]There's not going to be another hacking minigame.
[57:17.81]This is a bad update video.
[57:30.75]Fair enough.
[57:31.93]So, why'd you call?
[57:32.97]I'm just waiting for him to, like, balls himself one of those times.
[57:36.31]You know what I mean?
[57:37.11]And he's just like, oh, goddammit!
[57:38.93]He rolls over.
[57:39.77]Like a skateboarder.
[57:41.99]Worth it, though, right?
[57:44.52]It was.
[57:44.86]Until an hour ago.
[57:47.70]When the system went down.
[57:49.66]Citywide.
[57:50.86]Every tower.
[57:52.10]How?
[57:52.94]They tell me someone sabotaged the central server, and now all the towers are offline.
[57:57.22]Okay.
[57:58.82]Inside job?
[57:59.92]maybe we'll figure it out later right now we need to get the towers back online fast and you called me oh that's sweet I called someone I could trust turn it back on the signals are scrambled and we have no idea how to fix it you break it you buy it I thought you trusted me all right go turn on the five beacons let's take a look at this tower
[58:27.72]Oh, no, no, no.
[58:29.12]It's going to be one of the... It's going to be another... Okay.
[58:35.29]Match the wavelengths.
[58:40.15]Okay, one goes this way.
[58:41.09]Okay, I get it.
[58:41.49]There it is.
[58:58.88]What a hacker.
[59:02.82]You do this in the Arkham games?
[59:03.96]I was thinking about this the other day.
[59:08.04]We got an Arkham Spider-Man game.
[59:10.40]We have an Arkham Combat Middle Earth Medieval kind of swordplay game.
[59:17.51]Please God.
[59:18.57]Where the fuck is the Star Wars Lightsaber Arkham Battle System game?
[59:22.09]Imagine that shit.
[59:29.57]All right, look at a crime in the area.
[59:31.89]There's one right down here.
[59:37.11]It's a twist on the classic formula.
[59:38.75]I would love a lightsaber game that had the Arkham-style combat.
[59:43.65]You know, tough as nails.
[59:47.13]Tough as nails on the player.
[59:54.40]Pretty sure these guys didn't forget their keys.
[60:00.05]Enemies with melee weapons block most attacks, but are vulnerable to air launch attacks, webs, and throwables.
[60:06.32]So throw them in the air, and then box his ass.
[60:08.78]So, like that.
[60:10.26]He wants me to do this.
[60:18.36]Throw him down.
[60:26.88]Aww, he's trying to do something fun.
[60:27.80]Can they hurt each other?
[60:36.99]Karate kick Gamer down Summer I get it.
[60:55.41]This is you just have to do get a crime token Thanks for that Now I'm seeing an assault near you
[61:01.41]Come on, that's cute.
[61:02.93]That's cute, guys.
[61:04.93]Come on.
[61:05.31]Why are these people all on the ground?
[61:07.89]Oh, I think it's because I did something bad.
[61:09.65]You know, you can't tell me that that wasn't cute, okay?
[61:32.34]so you're the snitch back off creep yep she's the one the snitch leave me alone there we go be quiet lady don't touch me web strike right from behind no I'm gonna yep roots will block your melee attacks use webs and throw balls to make them okay so there's a lot of different enemy types here
[62:04.72]You know, one thing that's going to take a little bit of getting used to, that I've noticed, is I'm playing it, the Arkham games, right?
[62:11.71]When you see the, it's always triangle, always Y. So it's flipped over in my brain.
[62:17.42]I'm trying to press triangle when I see the thing over my head.
[62:19.56]I wonder if I can change that.
[62:22.54]I probably can, right?
[62:25.76]Can I change that?
[62:31.85]I don't, maybe I can't change that.
[62:39.88]Oh well.
[62:40.89]I'll just have to get used to it.
[62:56.50]You are just all over the place, aren't you?
[62:58.09]God damn.
[63:27.98]Oof, I didn't get it.
[63:28.83]Whoops.
[63:36.33]Whoops.
[63:41.17]There we go.
[63:46.90]Whoa, there's a gun involved?
[63:48.26]Save the hostage before time runs out.
[63:50.00]Use the L to aim at the target and press R1 to disarm them.
[63:58.76]and rip his eyeballs out.
[63:59.74]I'm not going to let it run out.
[64:05.86]All clear, ma'am.
[64:07.60]Imagine if it was a gruesome bolt of his eyes, just incredibly detailed, ripped the fuck out of his skull.
[64:13.45]Have you got somewhere to go?
[64:15.65]I can take care of myself.
[64:17.91]I'm sure you can, but just in case, there's a place called the Feast Center.
[64:21.89]Seen it.
[64:22.89]I don't want charity.
[64:24.09]They got the best wheat cakes in the city, hands down.
[64:27.98]You know, there's no continuity between the front and back of his suit.
[64:43.61]The front- the back of that suit is a tick.
[64:47.15]That's a full- that's a tick that just dined on your blood.
[64:50.51]That's a full body tick.
[65:02.60]Jesus.
[65:05.40]That takes practice.
[65:06.82]You don't just get to do that one day.
[65:10.30]Seriously.
[65:11.26]Spider cop spies his destination.
[65:14.59]A second surveillance tower.
[65:16.97]No, this is the other tower.
[65:18.31]Narrating yourself?
[65:20.01]What?
[65:20.53]No, of course not.
[65:22.79]The chief never did understand spider cop.
[65:25.29]Thought he was a loose cannon.
[65:27.17]Already regretting this.
[65:30.01]See, you guys don't like that.
[65:31.75]I like that.
[65:36.05]I think that's cute, okay?
[65:37.63]All right.
[65:45.47]Hold L2 and aim, and then... You have to fix the signal.
[65:48.83]What?
[65:50.33]Oh, why am I creeping over like that?
[65:51.63]This has to come a lot further this way.
[66:06.25]Almost, almost, almost.
[66:07.81]That's close.
[66:13.02]Get all the towers right now.
[66:14.40]I'm doing it.
[66:15.32]I'm going.
[66:22.29]Citywide activities.
[66:24.43]Picking up RFID.
[66:33.83]That's some interesting... Some big brother shit right there, don't you think?
[66:44.89]Alright, where is it?
[66:45.92]In the building over here?
[66:51.94]What is it?
[66:56.32]Oh, it's right there.
[67:02.27]No.
[67:03.03]It's...
[67:09.19]What am I doing here?
[67:12.98]City?
[67:13.28]Am I supposed to be on the ground?
[67:14.52]Is this one of those things I have to find in the area?
[67:20.28]Or am I just... Am I stupid?
[67:25.50]Oh.
[67:25.80]Okay, it's a backpack.
[67:28.43]Oh, wow.
[67:30.03]One of my old backpacks from high school.
[67:32.73]Forgot I attached tracking dots to these.
[67:37.09]How was I supposed to know that's what I was looking for?
[67:38.71]That's the first time I've ever seen that.
[67:40.19]I wonder how many of these are scattered around the city.
[67:44.75]Find backpacks or earn backpack tokens, which you can spend to craft beer.
[67:48.11]Okay, nice.
[67:49.64]Spider-Man craft beer!
[67:50.64]Okay, so you can just look everywhere.
[67:58.58]Cool.
[68:01.90]No other... I have no other skill points.
[68:08.93]For a second, I thought this was a costume.
[68:10.17]I was like, hold on.
[68:11.65]That would be odd if I could put this on.
[68:15.13]Perfect Dodge.
[68:15.87]Yeah, we already know how these work.
[68:21.34]How can you play this game and not get the 50 backpacks?
[68:25.26]Benchmarks.
[68:28.60]First date.
[68:29.98]First view.
[68:32.70]What?
[68:35.11]This is the menu to Fiorito.
[68:40.66]Personal pizza for $9.50.
[68:43.32]That's not bad.
[68:46.30]First date... Okay, I guess I don't understand what this is for.
[68:51.15]It's just random little toys.
[68:53.71]Research tokens, landmark tokens, photograph iconic locations.
[68:59.77]Open and complete research stations.
[69:01.79]Clear enemy bases.
[69:03.30]Resolve crimes.
[69:04.76]Do a challenge.
[69:05.54]Get a backpack.
[69:06.26]There's a lot of shit here.
[69:11.48]Download just the facts.
[69:21.51]Do I have to download it or do I own it?
[69:30.99]Got a robbery a few blocks away.
[69:32.86]Robbery.
[69:33.22]Spider cops on it.
[69:34.52]Part man, part spider, all cop.
[69:40.61]to download it first right over here and attack you get a suit for the backpacks that's cool hey fellas
[70:07.92]That's just not fair.
[70:10.68]That was such a great little scene.
[70:12.05]What are you supposed to do?
[70:14.21]You're in a little enclosed space van.
[70:15.67]That would be a bad place to be.
[70:22.49]Come here.
[70:27.14]Did I do it?
[70:27.66]Oh, there's a car pulling up.
[70:31.62]What?
[70:32.22]Get the car.
[70:33.42]No, pick up the car.
[70:34.46]I can't.
[70:35.39]No, I don't want to.
[70:37.53]Pick up the car.
[70:39.07]Pick up the car.
[70:39.83]Where's the... Do I need to unlock that?
[70:41.17]That's cool.
[70:47.54]Armed robbery stopped.
[70:48.34]Can I shake anybody's hand?
[70:55.49]Been doing a little thinking, Yuri.
[70:57.33]Policing's a young man's game.
[70:59.41]Yes, yes, he's here, yes.
[71:00.85]There's no spring chicken.
[71:02.91]Please be going where I think you're going.
[71:05.13]As of today, Spider Cop is officially retired.
[71:09.35]Oh, thank God.
[71:10.51]I need a drink.
[71:10.94]I just cut myself off.
[71:11.86]We'll all drink tonight, Yuri.
[71:13.64]Drink to the memory of Spider Cop's tireless... Yuri?
[71:18.20]Yuri, you there?
[71:18.86]I guess the emotion of the moment overwhelmed her.
[71:29.69]Just run up it.
[71:35.62]Alright.
[71:37.02]Turn this one.
[71:39.02]De-scramble.
[71:43.42]Didn't even need a second to do that one.
[71:48.10]Towers reveal collectibles, challenges, and side missions on the map.
[71:52.95]That's super cool.
[71:57.53]Level 3.
[71:58.49]Melee damage increased by 10%.
[72:02.43]Just a passive bonus?
[72:03.29]Nice.
[72:03.39]Just pluck them, dude.
[72:04.17]Don't leave them in there.
[72:04.97]Go back to the... Guess I'm going back.
[72:20.97]If you have, like, four chest hairs, guys, pluck them.
[72:23.05]It looks strange.
[72:23.41]So this is random shit I can just do.
[72:25.10]So what, I get a couple hours to kind of just chill and do whatever?
[72:28.46]Sounds like he's left the lab for the day.
[72:30.84]Good time to work on my suit in private.
[72:50.88]Oh, so I get privacy here.
[72:56.37]I missed a tower.
[72:57.97]Oh, but... Yeah, yeah, let's get it.
[73:01.77]All right, let's get it.
[73:02.83]Did he scramble?
[73:03.49]It's actually this one.
[73:04.91]I knew that.
[73:30.18]Towers in Greenwich.
[73:36.70]There's a lot of things opening up on the map here, though.
[73:39.02]Wait, a backpack!
[73:47.39]Wait, come back.
[73:51.93]It's down here?
[73:54.37]Okay.
[73:55.77]Backpack located!
[73:59.98]But where?
[74:01.70]Where is it?
[74:04.02]Ooh, there it is.
[74:08.12]Oscorp visitor pass.
[74:09.66]Got a backpack token.
[74:13.39]55 backpacks total.
[74:16.07]That's pretty neat.
[74:17.35]Should I get the other tile?
[74:18.11]God damn it.
[74:18.73]I'm going to have to do... I'm going to do law.
[74:19.97]Where?
[74:20.43]Actually, I'm going to do that.
[74:29.51]You give me too many things to do.
[74:34.71]Alright, car crash.
[74:37.81]Somebody hurt?
[74:41.33]Where are you?
[74:41.79]Are you in the car?
[74:43.47]Alright, I'm here.
[74:48.38]Sir, I need you to calm down.
[74:51.22]Just stay calm.
[74:51.90]Stop hitting the... Don't do that.
[74:53.24]You're not underwater.
[74:54.18]Don't do that underwater anyways.
[75:04.77]Extra flash.
[75:05.53]Alright, where's the other person?
[75:06.73]No, I'm not gonna do that again.
[75:11.35]It's already crushing him.
[75:12.23]Oh, he's fine.
[75:35.31]Do I hold my hand out?
[75:36.03]Is this like a tip thing situation?
[75:40.43]Spider-Man walking around doing this shit in the city is like the bellhop taking your bags upstairs.
[75:43.68]You give them like a $10 bill, right?
[75:50.60]I'm being evicted.
[75:52.47]Those of you that are saying, whoa, what are you talking about, Jeremy?
[75:54.59]You just saw them.
[75:55.53]I'm getting evicted from my fucking apartment.
[76:06.55]You can just high-five people.
[76:07.83]That's so funny.
[76:09.13]Alright, let's get the other tower.
[76:09.97]I love when the music picks back up when you get in the air.
[76:21.22]A break-in.
[76:24.52]Break-in in Little Italy.
[76:25.76]Let's look at these backpacks.
[76:27.10]Oh my god, somebody...
[76:30.17]I have fucking ADHD, guys.
[76:31.35]This is not going to go well.
[76:33.23]Well, I'm not going to do another mission for the rest of the game.
[76:36.47]Little Italy, where is it?
[76:41.86]Come on, Little Italy.
[76:43.06]Let's get to the top here.
[76:47.56]Let's get the tower.
[76:53.82]That was too late.
[76:57.38]They just reported it.
[77:09.54]Okay.
[77:10.60]More backpacks.
[77:14.02]If it was Boston, I'd know where to go.
[77:17.96]No, I wouldn't.
[77:18.46]I don't know every single street and every address in the state of Massachusetts.
[77:29.55]And plus Boston... Boston is a really fucking weird ass confusing city anyway.
[77:37.74]You know what city's not confusing?
[77:41.20]Las Vegas!
[77:47.21]Wait, something going on here.
[77:48.03]There's people here.
[77:53.21]Oh, it's a drug deal.
[77:55.97]Okay, cool.
[77:57.21]I mean, that's not cool, but you know what I'm saying.
[78:00.82]Web throw three objects at enemies.
[78:03.10]There's one.
[78:09.48]There's two.
[78:11.54]And... And let's get a combo meeting.
[78:14.94]Alright, I already got them both.
[78:24.35]I gotta remember, that always, that keeps them there.
[78:32.43]Nice.
[78:33.55]Who's the last guy?
[78:41.10]I mean, you're not wrong.
[78:41.74]It actually is not fair.
[78:42.63]This ain't even fair!
[78:47.49]Okay, got some crime tokens.
[78:48.05]Another, uh, up here?
[79:08.19]That was actually a legal drug deal.
[79:09.99]How do you have a legal drug deal?
[79:16.87]I want to get up high.
[79:17.71]Wait, I mean, I don't have to do the thing.
[79:22.11]Where?
[79:22.29]I don't see it.
[79:29.75]Damn it.
[79:30.93]I want to break up the crimes.
[79:31.95]I mean, I have to do the thing where I stand on the Empire State Building and jump off, right?
[79:35.99]That's what everybody does.
[79:39.82]I know you've probably seen it like a hundred times by now, but I haven't.
[79:46.67]Those guys are scary.
[79:49.09]Right there.
[79:59.52]They were selling sidewalk chalk.
[80:07.05]It's not too easy.
[80:08.91]There it is.
[80:09.39]There it is.
[80:09.69]Skip, skip, skip.
[80:10.09]I don't care.
[80:10.77]The crime's happening right here.
[80:11.63]Right there.
[80:20.26]How?
[80:20.54]Is it on the... What?
[80:23.58]Holy shit.
[80:25.74]How did they get up here?
[80:27.80]What?
[80:28.14]Yeah, let's meet on the fucking roof.
[80:32.71]How did they get up here?
[80:38.29]Throw three objects.
[80:39.25]I need three objects to throw?
[80:43.89]Yes, do that.
[80:47.37]No!
[80:50.09]I didn't break it up.
[80:51.61]Still got the combo, though.
[80:52.41]It's fine.
[81:02.85]That guy's dead.
[81:05.01]He fell off the roof.
[81:06.89]You good?
[81:12.14]Alright, so I kind of need to help you out of here.
[81:14.22]How can you get down?
[81:14.94]I guess you could go up here.
[81:17.66]What are we doing up here?
[81:18.50]Alright, they've got another tower over here.
[81:30.86]Same way as... There's no scenario where that would be... I'm not going to guess.
[81:38.25]Nope, we're doing that.
[81:45.96]Oh, stolen car.
[81:46.82]Stolen car!
[81:47.48]I have to jump on the car, right?
[81:50.62]Stop the car without taking damage.
[81:55.21]Stop the car.
[81:55.93]Whoa, he's got a gun!
[81:57.61]Okay, hold on.
[81:58.55]I failed it.
[82:02.46]Okay, hold on.
[82:04.28]I'm trying to drive the car.
[82:05.36]Okay, I get it.
[82:06.26]Oh, well.
[82:14.92]Wait till he comes out again.
[82:15.76]How many people are in this car?
[82:26.61]Oh, come on.
[82:27.71]No.
[82:27.93]That would have been so much better if I just threw him out.
[82:33.45]Oh, those people.
[82:38.34]Well, that was fun.
[82:44.54]You can go.
[82:44.96]You guys are fine.
[82:47.26]I already did it.
[82:49.29]You don't have to do anything about it.
[82:50.25]I did it already.
[82:56.81]Are they actually thinking they're going to get the guy to come out of the car that I just killed?
[83:02.38]Okay, all clear.
[83:03.00]Good.
[83:03.24]Thank you.
[83:03.62]Let's go.
[83:04.78]Oh, I gotta go this way.
[83:11.17]Hearing the people still scream is... I mean, wouldn't you?
[83:14.39]I would scream if a guy did this.
[83:19.08]If Spider-Man was real.
[83:20.12]Because think about how many people in the city probably think he's not real.
[83:22.56]Imagine you just looked up in the sky one day and Superman was flying over your house.
[83:30.10]You would scream.
[83:40.07]Even if you thought it could be real.
[83:42.15]It'd be like an urban legend.
[83:51.04]Backpack.
[83:54.48]Title joking aside, do you enjoy the web slinging?
[83:57.54]It looks nerve-wracking?
[83:58.52]No, it's very clean.
[84:02.76]Because you can queue up when you want to actually throw the web out.
[84:06.72]So, hold on, I'll show you in a second.
[84:09.20]First I have to
[84:12.57]Let me do this first.
[84:15.54]And by this, I mean find the backpack.
[84:17.14]Whoa, wait a minute.
[84:21.98]Is it... Is it up on the top?
[84:24.14]It is on the top.
[84:27.42]Nice.
[84:27.83]Dumpling recipe.
[84:28.59]That's cool.
[84:32.61]So what I'm saying is, it's not like, Oh shit, I gotta do it now!
[84:34.47]I gotta do it now!
[84:35.65]There are only... There are predefined places where you can put the web, it feels.
[84:42.66]So it's not a scenario where you have to aim.
[84:44.54]I'm not aiming the web.
[84:46.35]It's latching onto a predefined place in the building.
[84:48.59]And there's no fall damage.
[84:52.39]So you're... You'll be just fine.
[84:55.51]What is this?
[85:01.74]Uh... I guess we're going to the top of the police station.
[85:11.17]Oh, okay.
[85:11.81]Hi.
[85:13.75]The network is down.
[85:15.97]Look, I know you've been hacking into our crime system towers.
[85:19.53]Wasn't me.
[85:20.57]I mean, what towers?
[85:22.21]I don't mind.
[85:23.45]In fact, I need your help.
[85:25.14]I think someone's jamming the system, and they must be using multiple jammers to cover the full frequency range.
[85:30.34]Could you take a look?
[85:32.30]I guess I'll figure it out.
[85:33.14]If you help, I promise I won't tell anyone you're hacking us.
[85:35.98]I prefer to call it sharing, but sure.
[85:39.66]Jamming device is destroyed.
[85:40.58]Okay, so there's... It's just over here somewhere.
[85:42.90]Jamming dis... Alright, just gotta find it.
[85:44.36]Yes, that's true.
[85:45.15]By the way, I knew this before coming in here, but it is really, really cool...
[86:11.48]playing it and seeing it in real time.
[86:14.20]His voice lines change if you are standing still or walking.
[86:22.91]They have two or three different voice lines.
[86:24.93]One for I'm not exerting any effort and one for I'm swinging around.
[86:31.45]That's really awesome.
[86:33.21]Hearing it in real time is much cooler than just watching a video of it.
[86:36.43]Alright, so they've got up here.
[86:37.83]There it is.
[86:41.87]Oh, my God.
[86:42.48]I use Reddit, too.
[86:43.46]Oh, what?
[86:44.52]What?
[86:44.84]Oh.
[86:45.24]Okay.
[86:47.50]Well, let's do... I'm going to throw these guys off the edge.
[86:49.66]Can I?
[86:50.08]Not yet.
[86:54.87]Yes, I can.
[86:59.75]Get off that.
[87:09.32]I'm trying to throw him off the edge, but, you know, I'll just use the cover.
[87:13.18]Don't do it!
[87:20.89]I just got his gun!
[87:40.12]Whoa!
[87:40.94]Was that a grenade?
[87:42.02]I have no idea what I just did.
[87:44.10]Okay, I'm so confused at what just happened there.
[87:46.72]But it was cool.
[87:47.66]I'm trying to do that again.
[87:59.12]Alright, I'm too much focused on trying to pull a grenade out of somebody's hands.
[88:03.31]Here we go.
[88:12.93]Oh, damn it!
[88:13.81]No!
[88:17.75]Gotta take out the jamming device.
[88:19.39]Wait, what?
[88:23.77]That jammer's still messing up police communications.
[88:27.46]Ouch.
[88:29.36]That was horrible.
[88:34.54]Shotty workmanship.
[88:35.58]There's another one over here.
[88:38.54]I saw his parachute.
[88:41.43]I just took out a jamming device.
[88:42.93]That do anything?
[88:44.21]No, but like I said, there's probably a bunch of them.
[88:47.68]Makes sense.
[88:48.32]These little side missions, as kind of samey as they could be.
[88:53.70]I've not gotten bored yet.
[88:56.38]There's been a situation where I've gone, nah, I don't want to.
[88:59.61]I haven't done the next story mission.
[89:00.67]I'm just having fun.
[89:01.39]Let's do it.
[89:07.21]Where are they?
[89:07.77]On the other side of the building?
[89:09.33]Is there a creep mode I can do?
[89:13.76]Now they're all the way up.
[89:18.48]Nope.
[89:21.80]Hold on.
[89:22.90]Can I pick somebody off?
[89:29.40]No, I guess I screwed it up.
[89:32.28]That guy.
[89:36.86]I wonder what that was.
[89:37.80]Come on over here.
[89:45.91]I want to throw him off straight down.
[89:50.41]This guy's coming to investigate.
[89:51.37]I'll get him.
[89:51.69]And then I have to be facing this way.
[89:55.53]With every ounce of my exertion.
[89:57.39]I'm going to throw him down as hard as I can.
[90:10.52]Okay, here we go.
[90:16.86]Aw, why'd he pull them down?
[90:17.78]Dammit.
[90:22.95]Oh god!
[90:26.99]Oh my god!
[90:27.33]I'm gonna die!
[90:27.93]I'm gonna die!
[90:28.79]Don't die!
[90:29.57]Don't die!
[90:33.56]I'm gonna die!
[90:34.20]Holy shit!
[90:35.76]Don't die!
[90:36.38]Don't do it!
[90:39.48]That's a grenade!
[90:40.42]That's a grenade!
[90:41.50]I'm dead.
[90:46.46]ah fuck I should just throw it back at him the jammers emit a signal I can detect well at least I get I start here through the financial district and hunt for a signal found a stigma just need to follow it all right let's make it happen here at a jamming party and didn't invite
[91:21.64]What was that?
[91:23.14]I'm so confused.
[91:24.22]Why are people flying around?
[91:26.10]That was awesome.
[91:35.21]Holy shit.
[91:45.49]That takes a lot.
[91:46.23]If you can hit by any of those bullets, it's half your health.
[91:49.92]More than it.
[91:54.61]Where the fuck are you?
[92:03.25]Jesus Christ!
[92:05.82]Ayayay!
[92:08.48]Is there a guy up there?
[92:09.98]What am I?
[92:10.56]Hold on, what?
[92:14.42]Oh.
[92:24.02]I'm losing, I'm dying, but I'm having a lot of fun.
[92:27.38]I just leveled up.
[92:28.14]No, no, this is not even making me angry.
[92:31.62]That's... The snipers.
[92:32.28]I see, okay.
[92:32.66]Well, not up here.
[92:33.62]Okay, well.
[92:34.12]It's that guy.
[92:36.97]Alright, I see the sniper.
[92:51.76]There you are.
[92:52.56]You assholes.
[92:53.35]There you guys are.
[92:54.37]Okay.
[92:55.71]Let's go.
[92:56.05]I'm going to sneak up on... I'm going to pull this guy off the building.
[93:09.47]Is there a hitman situation here?
[93:12.02]Can I 47 this guy?
[93:13.96]Yes, I can.
[93:17.60]Oh, what?
[93:17.92]What?
[93:20.44]No, that's not what I wanted to do No, you didn't see me
[93:59.06]That's what I want.
[94:00.08]That's all I wanted.
[94:01.62]Can I throw from over here?
[94:02.54]Come on.
[94:10.62]No, that's gonna go all the way to the bridge.
[94:17.43]Now I can do this without a problem.
[94:19.23]Instantly dead.
[94:34.77]That's cool.
[94:38.36]I didn't get it.
[94:38.78]You got Davey.
[94:47.24]You got Davey.
[94:48.24]They got names.
[94:54.01]I love that.
[94:55.53]Just need to get rid of the jammer.
[94:59.23]Sometimes breaking stuff is the answer.
[95:01.53]Very cool.
[95:01.87]Very cool.
[95:03.74]Davey, no.
[95:05.62]I leveled up, though.
[95:08.60]Let's see, new skills.
[95:13.88]This is going to take me a minute.
[95:16.06]Grab and throw webbed and electrified.
[95:17.68]See, that... Okay, I don't even... I kind of don't need to look at anything else.
[95:22.96]Right?
[95:28.10]Web throw knocks enemies down during the wind-up.
[95:30.92]Very useful.
[95:33.19]Perch takedown range.
[95:36.17]You can pull them all the way up.
[95:39.07]Yank small arms like pistols.
[95:42.97]Heavy arms.
[95:44.13]Stealth takedowns generate much more focus.
[95:45.85]This actually is a stealth takedown.
[95:49.34]That was an awesome Hurricane DDT.
[95:55.26]You can whip them around in a circle like a blender.
[95:58.30]Brute enemies can be grabbed and thrown when webbed.
[96:00.98]Holy shit.
[96:03.99]Throwing objects damage.
[96:04.87]Everybody... You can throw rockets back at people.
[96:09.94]Get that now.
[96:10.94]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[96:12.32]Let me just take a look.
[96:15.96]I've been doing this probably like 50-60% of the time.
[96:20.21]So that's useful.
[96:20.83]This one also will be very useful.
[96:24.11]Timing window for perfect dodge.
[96:26.87]You can do the throw here.
[96:27.48]Ground strike.
[96:28.14]Ground strike.
[96:32.12]Cool last stand the slowest time before you die very useful I Have two skill points dumbass I'm I'm looking through the skill tree what I I'm gonna spend them both What what Second finisher on basic enemies, that's cool
[97:01.35]This looks like travel.
[97:03.73]Air attack deal additional damage.
[97:05.79]Well, I kind of want this.
[97:07.43]Because I want it.
[97:08.59]I'm going to do this and I'm going to do the perfect hits.
[97:10.95]Because that's very useful.
[97:16.86]So, press just as an attack lands to generate bonus focus.
[97:23.54]Improves focus gain at higher combos.
[97:26.32]I feel like these two here, or these three are probably completely necessary.
[97:33.12]Might as well get him out of the way first.
[97:38.46]Extended, uh, skit swing.
[97:40.84]I could get this too, but later.
[97:44.87]Alright.
[97:45.13]Last one is over here.
[97:46.09]Cool.
[97:46.21]Oh, speed freak.
[97:46.75]Speed freak.
[97:47.19]Was I going very fast?
[98:05.25]Get a co-op juke and chat.
[98:06.97]Oh, yes, we did.
[98:09.25]Those are always the good ones.
[98:10.23]Spot up here.
[98:10.73]Like up there.
[98:11.23]That's as high as you can go.
[98:14.45]Come on, Spidey.
[98:14.81]All right, let me take a gander at what's going on here.
[98:34.42]Just this one area.
[98:36.62]Alright, let's fuck him up.
[98:39.10]Oh, whoops.
[98:42.83]I have to grab you first.
[98:45.61]No, apparently not.
[98:48.03]That guy's got a gun.
[98:55.56]Alright, let's grab you around this way.
[98:56.90]Go ahead, blow those guys up.
[99:02.81]Shit, I didn't even know that guy was there.
[99:04.83]Okay.
[99:07.49]You got it.
[99:07.97]I gotta knock some of these guys in the air right now.
[99:19.14]Oh, jeez.
[99:19.86]Oh, jeez!
[99:20.40]I don't think that's ever gonna get old.
[99:43.31]Dead?
[99:43.65]Good.
[99:44.85]Nope.
[99:45.21]There we go.
[99:48.61]Only one guy.
[99:56.41]Watch him out.
[99:57.67]Come on.
[100:05.09]Oh, come on!
[100:08.21]Oh, damn it!
[100:10.26]I was really hoping that was gonna work.
[100:15.15]Oh, just like a little nudge.
[100:23.71]What the fuck was that?
[100:28.21]Will you just trip already?
[100:31.67]You're embarrassing me.
[100:32.97]Oh god, just fucking fine.
[100:44.91]Aw.
[100:45.17]I didn't forget.
[100:51.30]I was trying to do a cool thing.
[100:56.16]The network is down.
[101:00.86]Check out activity on the dock.
[101:04.35]Great.
[101:05.49]Any more info on Fisk's man or those outfits?
[101:08.33]No, but the system's reporting unauthorized activity down by the dock.
[101:12.29]I'm sending coordinates now.
[101:14.03]I'll check it out.
[101:15.95]Kind of far away.
[101:17.81]Oh, god.
[101:18.85]Time limit?
[101:23.92]Straight down.
[101:25.12]Max velocity.
[101:32.66]You know, in real life, if you did that, both your arms would instantly break and probably rip off.
[101:40.73]Guys, people can hardly do a rope swing in front of a lake.
[101:44.37]People break their arms jumping from like four feet.
[101:49.05]You'd be like, here I go!
[101:49.87]This is going to be so much fun!
[101:52.29]Then you'd have to be gone.
[101:57.43]Spider-Man, real life.
[101:59.12]He is 10%.
[101:59.38]All right.
[101:59.84]Defeat the smugglers.
[102:00.82]All right, so here's my plan.
[102:13.07]Oh, there's a boat.
[102:16.29]That's cool.
[102:16.81]Okay, hold on.
[102:17.33]We got a guy here.
[102:18.01]Guy right in front, right?
[102:20.15]Is there a guy right there?
[102:20.81]The only guy that's right there.
[102:21.91]Let's fucking... Let's shit on this guy.
[102:24.92]Okay.
[102:30.36]Let's shit on that guy's head.
[102:33.30]Hold on.
[102:33.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[102:36.01]Let me try to do a stealth mission here.
[102:44.86]I can't, hold on, I can't grab that?
[103:08.91]Why can't I, I wanted to grab the helicopter.
[103:24.54]He's done.
[103:24.96]There's only one guy left right here.
[103:28.40]Alright, I'm gonna snap this guy's neck.
[103:34.82]Told you.
[103:35.56]Just broke his neck.
[103:36.76]Let's investigate.
[103:44.79]Batman can't kill who the Spider-Man can.
[103:46.63]Well, I'm not actually killing people.
[103:48.15]Uh-oh.
[103:54.83]It was a trap the whole time.
[104:00.22]It was just a trap the whole time.
[104:01.56]You.
[104:01.80]I'm just gonna get rid of you immediately.
[104:09.25]Let's do it.
[104:10.27]A hundred times combo meter.
[104:11.61]You ready?
[104:44.98]No, and I did it!
[104:45.90]I did it!
[104:46.40]I dodged it!
[104:47.00]Wait, that guy's still running after me.
[104:48.50]Oh, whatever.
[104:56.34]Oh, fuck.
[104:56.66]Watch out for that thing.
[104:58.63]What happened to it?
[104:59.91]I have no idea.
[105:00.29]Oh, god.
[105:20.47]They're still hurting each other.
[105:21.65]I tried to get away so bad.
[105:29.04]That dive is gonna... I'll laugh at that every time.
[105:48.19]I got blasted into the ocean.
[105:49.82]Yeah.
[105:52.14]They carry assault rifles?
[105:53.10]This looks oddly fun for a Spider-Man game.
[105:55.84]Good.
[105:55.94]I mean, so far, what has it been, like two hours?
[106:17.33]I've done one story mission.
[106:18.67]Or two story missions.
[106:22.71]This is great.
[106:23.81]I'm having a great time.
[106:30.89]I'm gonna... I have to... No more distractions.
[106:32.39]I'll do the story mission.
[106:33.87]But for the backpack right here.
[106:35.69]So, like, come on.
[106:37.31]It's right here.
[106:38.83]And there's one right over there too.
[106:39.89]Right next to that backpack.
[106:40.89]So let me get these two backpacks and then we're gonna go and do the story mission.
[106:43.74]Just wait.
[106:53.41]The hell is it?
[106:55.65]It's like on the flag part?
[107:03.90]There it is.
[107:05.54]Blending it.
[107:08.24]Graphing calculator.
[107:09.36]Cool.
[107:10.62]ADHD TV.
[107:15.56]I'm sorry, but look.
[107:18.57]They just have to get the ones in a row here.
[107:20.33]And then we can just go as fast as we can to the next story mission.
[107:29.85]It's right there.
[107:31.73]Oh, that's really far away.
[107:32.83]Never mind.
[107:33.19]Let's go to the store.
[107:41.56]I skipped the lore.
[107:42.44]It's okay.
[107:50.07]All I care about is the...
[108:00.36]Okay.
[108:00.94]Where are we here?
[108:02.30]Is it up?
[108:02.64]Is it down?
[108:07.32]Get up there, dude.
[108:07.82]What are you doing?
[108:09.68]It's probably all the way up.
[108:14.16]Right?
[108:14.36]It's going to be on the big statue.
[108:15.50]I don't hear any beeps, though.
[108:24.89]There it is.
[108:28.41]Right here?
[108:29.47]We have a possible kidnapping.
[108:31.15]Proceed to two bridges.
[108:32.78]Over.
[108:36.64]Where is it?
[108:37.96]OK, now I hear the beeps.
[108:45.98]There it is.
[108:47.00]Grave concerns about the risk to civil liberties posed by the police department's crime system and their omnipresent powers.
[108:56.00]Backpacked Open Science Trophy.
[108:57.49]Here's the lore.
[108:57.81]I'll spin it around for you.
[108:58.39]I skipped it.
[108:58.95]I'm sorry.
[109:00.23]Alright, now we can go.
[109:00.79]Why does this guy have a gun?
[109:02.45]Okay.
[109:02.57]Wait, there's random assassins?
[109:25.37]That guy did not do a great job.
[109:27.19]Let's go.
[109:32.90]Stop skipping.
[109:33.80]I'm sorry.
[109:35.32]I have to apologize.
[109:36.24]I just can't.
[109:36.66]I have to.
[109:40.84]I'm out of my mind.
[109:41.68]I have to skip the things that I skip.
[109:43.52]What?
[109:44.02]Just whatever.
[109:44.56]You don't understand.
[109:49.91]Save the game?
[109:50.37]All units, narcotic sale report in progress.
[109:59.30]Oh, that was fucking fun!
[110:00.81]Oh, get out of fucking town here.
[110:03.07]No!
[110:03.57]That was going so well.
[110:04.41]Run for the car?
[110:27.57]Wait, what?
[110:27.85]Come here!
[110:28.21]Come out through this side.
[110:33.24]Yep.
[110:33.50]That's the driver.
[110:40.42]There we go.
[110:55.06]Cool that there's more than one animation required.
[110:57.61]I didn't do it.
[110:58.75]It hurt me.
[110:59.25]I got crushed.
[111:01.11]Hey, you did it.
[111:01.87]Nothing puts a pep in my step like halting an illegal drug deal.
[111:06.87]That's a cream.
[111:09.13]This one right here.
[111:15.28]Where is it?
[111:15.68]Right on the edge there.
[111:16.92]No, don't perch.
[111:24.32]Right there.
[111:27.90]There's another crime, too.
[111:29.06]Here, here's your lore.
[111:31.10]Sorry!
[111:31.30]This is a great game.
[111:31.98]Okay, the crime is gone.
[111:32.70]There's another... Hold on, there's a... Okay, you took a child, right?
[111:35.40]You took, like, a seven-year-old.
[111:36.34]And you brought him into a room.
[111:54.91]And you put every candy and every cupcake and every ice cream flavor that's ever existed.
[112:01.46]And then their homework is ten tables in front of them.
[112:05.40]Past everything.
[112:07.60]That's what this is.
[112:08.82]I'm so- I can't do my homework right now.
[112:10.36]You put every kind of fucking candy here.
[112:15.23]Who's here?
[112:17.19]There's a crime here.
[112:18.47]What's up?
[112:25.77]Attack three enemies from behind.
[112:30.01]I can do that.
[112:31.00]Oh, that was bad.
[112:36.32]Web three enemies to a wall.
[112:57.90]Do I have a third person here?
[113:00.46]I can't.
[113:00.76]Alright, I gotta web these guys to a wall.
[113:02.53]That's like the easiest way to do that.
[113:05.75]Kinda have to push you over there a little bit.
[113:14.29]Nope.
[113:17.66]Come back over here.
[113:19.70]This way.
[113:21.82]Oh, what?
[113:24.50]I have to get the super completion.
[113:26.80]Can I, like, web throw him into a wall?
[113:34.97]Okay.
[113:36.13]I mean, that... I got it!
[113:42.05]Okay!
[113:42.55]He got it!
[113:43.55]He stuck on a wall somewhere!
[113:44.93]That took a long time.
[113:56.50]Oh, that's bad.
[114:02.98]The Lula bounces.
[114:04.40]I lost one of my two pairs.
[114:07.68]Shit.
[114:09.59]Almost.
[114:12.01]Oh, that doesn't... That doesn't... Hold on.
[114:28.78]Alright, do I eat the Milky Way or the Twix?
[114:36.07]The Milky Way or the Twix?
[114:37.03]Milky Way.
[114:37.43]Is there a car up here?
[114:52.67]No.
[114:56.68]Punch!
[114:56.96]Punch him!
[114:58.34]I gotta land on him!
[114:59.08]Punch somebody!
[114:59.58]Here we are!
[115:06.97]Now what?
[115:40.44]This is, this is, this is the funnest game ever.
[115:44.92]Right in this buddy.
[116:09.83]I didn't even care about the objective.
[116:12.65]Gotta be a special kind of crazy to rob a storefront in the city Spider-Man protects.
[116:17.00]This is... We'll see.
[116:20.58]We'll see.
[116:21.36]I mean, we might have something that's higher up than House Flipper for the year.
[116:25.55]Because, I mean, obviously House Flipper is number one, right?
[116:33.71]It doesn't matter what.
[116:38.68]Go back to the guy.
[116:39.44]There's a guy?
[116:39.84]What do you mean there's a guy?
[116:40.81]Let me just get the beacon.
[116:56.50]Let me get the beacon.
[116:57.40]There's a vehicle pursuit.
[117:00.18]No, just don't even...
[117:03.12]Just forget it.
[117:03.92]It's gonna come right by me.
[117:05.32]I can scramble this and then get it.
[117:06.94]I can scramble the Twix, and then I can go get the Skittles.
[117:11.49]Quick, come on.
[117:18.93]Let's go, let's go, go!
[117:28.56]Losing them.
[117:30.38]Oh, yeah?
[117:32.77]Hey, how are you doing?
[117:35.47]Last one.
[117:38.85]Let's see what I gotta do.
[117:47.45]Throw him out.
[117:48.09]Block the car.
[117:48.79]Got him.
[117:59.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:00.45]You still alive?
[118:01.61]Yeah, you are.
[118:02.01]Okay, what?
[118:30.00]But do you feel like Spider-Man?
[118:37.64]I mean, no.
[118:39.74]But I don't have to feel like Spider-Man.
[118:41.52]I just have to feel like I'm controlling Spider-Man.
[118:44.10]Right?
[118:50.99]Right here.
[118:57.01]I'm Spider-Man.
[119:01.44]Alright, let's get, uh, this is, I promise I'm done after this.
[119:04.02]I promise.
[119:04.97]I'm gonna go to the actual story mission.
[119:18.05]Unless there's a backpack right here.
[119:20.71]Don't forget about the crime.
[119:21.69]Can't solve them all.
[119:24.31]I'm sorry, you can't solve all the crimes.
[119:28.06]There's two there, though.
[119:28.74]They're trying to tempt me so bad.
[119:29.78]No, you cannot do it.
[119:30.50]You can't solve them all.
[119:37.39]Don't tell me there's a backpack.
[119:38.21]I don't care.
[119:38.51]I don't even want to know.
[119:52.36]Don't.
[119:52.80]Don't.
[119:53.10]I don't care about the backpack.
[119:55.22]Just go into the house.
[119:56.08]I've had a broken suit this whole time.
[120:05.49]I was supposed to repair my suit an hour and a half ago.
[120:12.33]This is the first cutscene in an hour.
[120:21.88]Try to walk out the door.
[120:24.98]Swipe my badge.
[120:30.70]Good, we get to slow down.
[120:32.28]I get to do another one of those little mini games.
[120:35.82]sneak in my spot no fuck that table I want to get back to doing the other thing repair the suit am I going to do 100 probably not but this is the best game that's come out this year so dr octavius I uh what you got there I know it's only been two hours but I know you'd be here let's be real what are you working on oh just a side project
[121:06.23]So, wait, this is where he finds out.
[121:07.37]Of course.
[121:10.01]It's you.
[121:10.47]I don't know what you're talking about.
[121:12.31]Oh, come on, Parker.
[121:13.31]It's obvious.
[121:14.44]Let me explain.
[121:15.24]I only wish you'd told me sooner.
[121:16.38]I wanted to.
[121:19.52]But I was afraid that if word got out, my family might be in danger.
[121:25.66]Yes.
[121:27.97]I guess if you design his equipment, you're bound to be a target, too.
[121:32.59]Yeah.
[121:34.65]Yeah.
[121:36.67]oh your secret safe really didn't put that together did you well I'll leave you to it it's so obvious you're the guy that makes the suit check your oh no it had to have been a lie
[122:05.98]check your email he declared war during an email I wonder if that's ever gonna happen I hope this isn't how doc fires me oh otto wrote that peter the revelation of your second job as spider-man suit crafter is that the right term is a reminder of the good man and partner you are
[122:33.93]No matter how hard you work, you still find time to help others.
[122:38.23]I hope you don't mind, but I noticed the suit was a bit damaged, and I took the liberty of sketching up some of my own improvements.
[122:45.63]Attached are a few ideas I had on how you could enhance his suit and help protect Spider-Man, who does so much for this city.
[122:52.98]Looking forward to the incredible work that we are doing and changing the world together.
[122:57.18]Your partner and friend.
[123:01.32]I'm not a good elf.
[123:02.20]I'm not a good elf.
[123:03.94]I'm a gnome!
[123:05.56]Right?
[123:06.18]Right?
[123:06.38]That's where that belongs?
[123:07.54]White spider, huh?
[123:15.87]Okay.
[123:22.27]I'm actually sad I just said that out loud.
[123:27.33]Because now I'm going to keep that dumb meme
[123:34.43]You can make advanced suits.
[123:38.52]It's everywhere.
[123:39.12]It's all I see.
[123:43.04]I feel like I'm getting gnomed out in public too.
[123:46.44]People on their cell phones putting them in my face.
[123:49.98]I went to Starbucks the other day and I ordered a coffee.
[123:53.56]Just a simple, I'll take just a small cold brew, just with ice, please.
[123:59.12]The lady rang me up.
[124:00.96]And right before she took my money, she just fucking played the video on her phone.
[124:05.98]And I got the coffee for free.
[124:08.29]She just put the coffee... It's getting... It's getting bad.
[124:11.53]This needs to stop happening.
[124:22.07]Are you... Are you okay?
[124:25.26]I'm... I'm just fine.
[124:26.50]Alright, hold the crafted advance suit.
[124:31.69]New suit and suit power unlocked.
[124:35.51]Crafting a new suit auto-equips the new suit power.
[124:37.69]Press X to continue.
[124:38.45]Suit power.
[124:40.95]Suits can also be upgraded with suit mods.
[124:42.79]Unlock and equip suit mods here.
[124:45.37]Complete side missions and activities to unlock suits, suit powers, and suit mods.
[124:50.45]Did you just give me like a disgusted face when I said cold brew?
[124:55.74]What?
[124:56.48]No, you can't be serious.
[124:58.52]That's the best way to drink an iced coffee.
[125:03.13]Don't deal with that.
[125:04.86]Cold Brew is wonderful.
[125:10.20]Use tokens to create suit mods.
[125:12.50]Suit mods increase utility and boost your offense and defense.
[125:15.93]You can equip three of them at the same time.
[125:17.47]All right, nice.
[125:21.59]Cold Brew.
[125:22.83]Cold Brew, yeah, come on.
[125:25.81]Cold Brew is where you don't heat up the beans.
[125:30.60]You put the crushed up beans in cold water.
[125:34.28]And it takes about like 14 to 15 hours.
[125:41.20]There's my new suit.
[125:44.96]Who am I talking to?
[125:47.05]I mean, there's no one in this room, right?
[125:52.95]So, no one in person.
[125:56.07]But there are, what, 37,000 people here?
[126:03.95]Do I get extra speed?
[126:08.61]Here we go!
[126:09.74]I love this fucking move.
[126:23.18]I wish I could do it more often.
[126:32.15]This is fun.
[126:33.29]Swinging around.
[126:33.87]There we go.
[126:34.23]Now his back has a spider on it.
[126:35.21]I'm gonna tick.
[126:35.65]You see that spin?
[126:36.99]Alright, let me slow down.
[126:37.83]So I got... Let's just do the mission.
[126:39.45]That felt good.
[126:39.95]That felt real good.
[127:06.24]Dude, I know.
[127:07.98]Is this a joke?
[127:08.74]Is this like somebody make a funny meme or something here with this, like, do you feel like Spider-Man?
[127:13.59]Somebody had to, right?
[127:20.87]I'm going to dodge three times.
[127:32.01]That's right.
[127:32.45]You can't.
[127:33.90]Dodge under.
[127:34.40]Here we go.
[127:35.36]No, that's a dodge over.
[127:36.22]Come here.
[127:40.46]I'm going to dodge under you.
[127:42.86]No, that's dodge over.
[127:44.80]Oh, you.
[127:45.89]Whoa, you.
[127:52.35]What?
[127:52.49]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[127:57.55]Come on.
[127:57.77]I'm just going to do it one more time.
[128:05.41]Go on, go through his legs.
[128:07.43]There we go.
[128:11.51]Nope.
[128:14.28]Why am I looking at the chat right now?
[128:17.42]Does he punch and then slide?
[128:23.04]There we go, okay.
[128:25.69]Suit power.
[128:29.41]What is my suit power?
[128:42.34]I guess I have infinite?
[128:43.86]Okay.
[128:44.74]You have to punch and then slide.
[128:48.42]Just a super heal.
[128:49.28]Okay.
[128:49.80]Let me see here.
[128:55.92]Suit.
[128:58.60]Suit power.
[128:59.54]Hybrid biomembrane rapidly generates focus for a short time.
[129:02.40]Okay.
[129:04.48]Suit mods.
[129:06.11]Do I have any?
[129:06.77]I do.
[129:08.59]Gadget attacks generate focus.
[129:12.31]Reduce incoming melee damage.
[129:16.59]Ah, it costs backpack tokens.
[129:24.99]Classic suit repaired.
[129:26.74]Noir suit.
[129:28.52]Scarlet spider suit.
[129:29.78]I want this one.
[129:32.70]Can't need more tokens, though.
[129:37.52]Leap into the air and web everything in sight.
[129:41.65]Enemies no longer call for backup when alerted.
[129:43.39]What about this one?
[129:47.04]Nothing.
[129:47.38]No associate.
[129:47.92]There's no suit power.
[129:51.32]Okay.
[129:51.62]Well... I kind of like the focus generation one.
[129:55.82]What about can I change the suit power?
[129:57.10]No.
[129:58.22]I will put the mods on.
[129:59.20]Can I... Is this a scenario where... Do I get to keep them forever?
[130:03.19]Or are they locked in here?
[130:08.05]I'm kind of scared to do it.
[130:13.51]You can change the power.
[130:15.57]You have to keep them in there.
[130:16.41]You can mix and match everything.
[130:17.35]Okay, cool.
[130:19.47]Well, I definitely want that.
[130:22.46]Suit power can change as well.
[130:23.66]That's cool.
[130:26.36]So I can only put these two in.
[130:27.42]So this is reduce incoming melee damages.
[130:29.32]Cool, why not just have it?
[130:33.46]I need a landmark token.
[130:37.88]So less damage and generate with focus.
[130:40.82]Cool.

[131:27.57]Selfie!
[131:27.71]I didn't skip that.
[131:29.31]That was the end of the conversation.
[131:48.18]Alright, let's go.
[131:51.65]There wasn't very much room to dive while I'm there, but that's okay.
[131:54.41]Alright, where am I going?
[131:55.03]Up there?
[131:56.57]Not that far.
[131:57.07]Right there.

[133:17.51]I'm going to do this.
[133:18.53]Let's upgrade.

[133:21.99]Just do them both, right?
[133:23.63]Crime tokens?
[133:24.21]Might as well just do them both.
[133:28.79]I don't see why not.
[133:29.72]I'm going to have to use them eventually.
[133:34.58]I can do this too.
[133:36.24]Adds two shots to the max web shooter.

[134:39.96]Is there a crunch?
[134:46.73]Two out of five.
[134:49.33]Are they gonna climb up?

[136:45.92]I gotta get the guy with the gun.
[137:14.68]Is that guy dead?
[137:16.08]He might be.

[137:57.88]Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way.
[138:02.77]Not gonna get a fire grenade.
[138:11.81]Where'd he go?
[138:12.65]He's up there.
[138:15.31]Oh, use the suit power.
[138:16.29]Fuck, I forgot.
[138:26.55]Your new suit power comes with a suit power.
[138:29.13]Your new, yeah, you know.
[138:31.40]Suit power will give you special abilities.
[138:32.72]Your current suit power continuously builds focus.
[138:34.70]Once used, your suit power will regenerate.
[138:38.30]Like that.
[138:39.30]So now we can just do it.
[138:40.26]Why'd you run by me?

[141:43.47]Fisk has more construction sites throughout the city, vetting their fronts too.
[141:47.24]Keep an eye out and report in if you see anything suspicious.
[141:52.26]Complete more Fisk hideouts around the city to earn more base tokens.
[141:56.68]So that's where the word base comes from.

[143:08.12]So I can do either.
[143:08.94]It doesn't matter.
[143:11.31]Enemies no longer call for backup when alerted.
[143:13.14]I guess that's kind of cool.
