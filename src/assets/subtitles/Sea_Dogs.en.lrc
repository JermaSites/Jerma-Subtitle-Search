[01:57.37]I think I might be getting sick too.
[02:01.69]So it might be a sick stream in the near future or today.
[02:06.19]Got a little bit of a headache.
[02:08.81]Hey, sometimes you get a headache, right?
[02:14.63]You strike me as a man who smokes a cigar on the subway train.
[02:19.37]No, I don't smoke, man.
[02:25.12]Alright, I'm going to get my dog down here.
[02:27.74]And then we're going to get started.
[02:30.14]I have a poll for you all to vote on for which game you want to see.
[02:40.50]What do you want to see?
[02:41.33]Because there are some options.
[02:46.47]While you vote on that, I will be right back in a couple minutes.
[02:52.24]Buy yourself a cigar.
[02:53.32]Thank you.

[05:47.93]Is that what we're doing?
[05:48.73]I don't know how good this game is.
[05:53.51]I just saw it on Steam and I was like, you know what?
[05:55.95]I'm gonna put it on the damn list.
[06:03.08]Hmm.
[06:09.57]Hold on one second, making a tweet.
[06:19.30]Can you see my dog?
[06:20.74]That sounds like I'm doing that.
[06:22.22]Hold on a second, guys.
[06:26.42]I'm just making a tweet.
[06:33.39]It sounds like I'm just wolfing down food.
[06:38.24]Yeah, as I'm starting at 2 p.m.
[06:41.29]I just gotta like finish my burrito lunch really quick.
[06:54.17]I love everything about that.
[06:59.68]I microwaved a bunch of tacos.
[07:05.70]That's my dog eating a treat.
[07:10.79]How long is it going to take me to write this?
[07:12.11]Come on, geez.
[07:14.95]I'm so old.
[07:16.07]I'm so old.
[07:20.33]It just took me 10 minutes to write one sentence on my smartphone.
[07:28.52]Alright.
[07:30.92]So what does it look like?
[07:31.98]What does it look like, huh?
[07:39.07]We might not be in this game for very long.
[07:43.93]Judging by the fact that I don't know.
[07:46.07]It might be a piece of crap.

[08:07.93]That's surprising to me.
[08:11.76]Somehow.
[08:15.60]I'm going to mute the audio because it might be extremely loud.
[08:18.30]So give me one more second.
[08:59.10]Why would we not play Sea Dogs?
[09:03.46]Actually, it has a good reviews.
[09:05.33]Thank God I muted.
[09:06.37]Thank God I muted the stream.
[09:09.37]Because this is like a UFO landing inside my brain.

[09:23.23]Shit.
[09:24.21]Hold on.

[28:43.64]I'm looking for Michael de Montfort.
[28:46.06]Where is he?
[28:48.46]What do you need of him?
[28:49.40]I am his brother.
[28:50.92]My father told me that Michael is in trouble.
[28:54.70]Oh, this is... This is not... His finger was just clipping through the dialogue box.
[29:00.06]That was outrageous.
[29:01.56]I've never seen something like that before.
[29:02.78]Uh, you know, you look very suspicious to me, so I'm arrest... Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[29:10.04]I don't remember Monsieur de Montfort having any brothers.
[29:12.19]You know, Monsieur, you look very suspicious to me.
[29:14.85]I'm arresting you for further investigation.
[29:17.61]Lieutenant, detain this man.
[29:22.43]Yield your weapons right away and follow us while I'm up the creek.
[29:27.87]Yeah, follow us while we, like, fucking walk around in circles and accidentally bump into each other.
[29:32.83]I'm in prison, though.
[29:38.02]This just went from 0 to 100.
[29:39.98]How do I get out of here?
[29:45.00]I don't have much time.
[29:49.01]Who is this dude?
[29:49.95]Why is like fucking Benjamin Franklin here?
[29:52.30]That's not Benjamin.
[29:54.04]Why have you put me in prison?
[29:55.45]It's inappropriate.
[29:56.27]I am the French nobleman.
[29:58.85]Listen to me, young man.
[30:00.48]Don't interrupt me.
[30:01.32]You're talking with the governor general of the French colonies in Caribbean archipelago.
[30:04.86]I forgive your tone only because of your ignorance about who you really are talking to, but I'd recommend you to be more restrained.
[30:10.86]Oh, forgive me.
[30:12.28]Oh, better now, your previous question.
[30:14.14]You were considered by mistake a Spanish spy and put under arrest until your status is clear.
[30:19.26]Blasted Castilians has become more active recently.
[30:22.18]There I ordered to detain all suspicious people.
[30:25.61]But we know who you are.
[30:26.53]You are really Charles DeMar, brother of Michael DeMar.
[30:29.15]Even though you have different last names.
[30:31.07]And I personally came down here in order to release you.
[30:33.21]And you are yelling at me like a little boy.
[30:34.89]Pardon me.
[30:35.29]Let me out, please.
[30:36.24]Yes, you are.
[30:36.78]But I want to talk privately with you before a sergeant will open up your chamber.
[30:39.74]Do you know that, little brother, you're one of the most worthless warriors in the order and put away custody?
[30:45.32]I know.
[30:45.72]Yes, I know this.
[30:46.60]Glad to hear that.
[30:47.22]I want you to know that as much as a pauper could you tell me to open the door.
[30:50.25]Yes.
[30:50.77]Yes.
[30:51.27]Yes.
[30:51.65]Yes.
[30:52.21]Please wait.
[30:52.67]Yes.
[30:53.23]Yes.
[30:53.81]Yes.
[30:55.75]Anybody get any of that?
[30:58.45]Any of it at all?
[31:01.43]I'm out of the prison.
[31:04.94]I'm out of the prison.
[31:08.72]How did I get out of the fucking cell?
[31:12.12]It was just like, okay, you know what?
[31:13.74]Here's a loading screen and we're gonna put you on the other side of the door.
[31:21.51]Where?
[31:22.05]I need like a weapon.
[31:23.03]Who is this guy?
[31:25.63]I'm not guilty.
[31:26.41]I don't give a shit about you.
[31:38.16]Am I playing sorcery?
[31:39.60]What did this guy say?
[31:51.09]I'm not guilty.
[31:52.25]I don't give a shit about you.
[31:56.98]Why can't I, like, set any of these people free?
[31:59.74]I am not guilty.
[32:00.83]Shut up.
[32:04.29]What a bastard.
[32:06.21]I can't believe that.
[32:07.23]I'm gonna get a fucking headache.
[32:14.45]You can pass.
[32:15.01]The warden gave his permission.
[32:18.05]Okay, good.
[32:22.15]You know, they could have skipped this entire sequence.
[32:24.13]If you're going to get released immediately, there's no reason to be down here.
[32:33.94]I want to bash this guy's brains in with a hammer.
[32:37.00]I am the prison warden.
[32:39.78]What do you need here?
[32:42.18]Oh, nothing special, you know.
[32:43.39]Just looking around the city.
[32:44.39]I just wandered here on occasion.
[32:51.66]Uh, you're not really... not really sitting in that chair.
[32:56.22]Not really sitting in that chair.
[32:59.40]In fact, you're like, you're like, Prenus is like, in the table.
[33:02.42]And these guys don't seem to have a problem with that.
[33:06.44]Why am I in like, first person mode?
[33:11.21]So I just leave?
[33:12.13]I guess I can just walk out.
[33:25.37]What was the point of any of that?
[33:28.57]I'm just back where I started.
[33:29.66]It's like I got the wrong dialogue option.
[33:41.26]I wanna look at, like, the controls.
[33:42.50]Because if I can just pull out my sword, somebody's dying.
[33:47.86]Controls on land.
[33:50.32]Okay.
[33:52.12]Okay, yeah, we can press E.
[33:55.79]We can press E. E doesn't work.
[34:00.79]He's not doing combat mode.
[34:03.29]Uh, I don't... I want information.
[34:08.81]I got nothing to ask you.
[34:09.75]Okay.
[34:10.77]Well, I want to go into combat mode.
[34:14.46]Controls on land.
[34:17.84]Perform action.
[34:18.84]Move forward.
[34:21.70]Switch to running.
[34:22.58]Toggle combat mode.
[34:23.64]Drink elixir.
[34:24.32]Drink antidote.
[34:27.73]Loot corpse.
[34:33.17]Okay, well, maybe I can't do anything here.
[34:36.01]My sword is gone.
[34:41.65]Oh.
[34:42.13]Well, that would probably explain it, then.
[34:47.06]Why did it just... It just went into, like, Resident Evil mode.
[34:51.94]Okay, you gotta stop that shit.
[34:54.38]Jeez.
[34:56.58]I'm in the church now.
[35:04.41]I'm looking for my brother.
[35:07.33]Sorry to interrupt the service.
[35:13.17]Welcome to our holy abode, my son.
[35:15.57]Hello, father.
[35:16.85]You're not my father, and don't you ever address me that way again.
[35:22.50]Oh, you blasphemer!
[35:23.74]Away with you!
[35:24.72]Don't you dare to defile our lord's temple with your presence!
[35:30.09]And I and so did not gather here to say long.
[35:33.05]That guy's neck just broke like three times.
[35:42.90]Is there something you need?
[35:44.20]No, nothing, father.
[35:45.12]I just insulted your entire practice.
[35:47.14]Alright, now let me talk to him again.
[35:53.51]Go away from the temple.
[35:55.27]To us with you not about what to talk.
[35:58.91]Yeah, fuck you.
[36:04.74]Greetings.
[36:05.36]My name is August.
[36:06.24]Do I have to just find the fucking random guy?
[36:13.36]I want to find the road somewhere.
[36:15.20]I want to know more about the locals.
[36:16.52]I want to know what they say about one person.
[36:19.80]Well, farewell.
[36:24.08]Geez.
[36:25.44]I got a feeling this is gonna take me a while.
[36:27.86]And I and so did not gather here to stay too long.
[36:31.85]Yeah, that is what was just actually said by some random dude.
[36:40.85]You tell me I can't go into, like, punch face mode?
[36:48.80]Alright, well, we didn't go down here.
[36:52.20]So many random fucking streets.
[36:54.50]The harbor office.
[36:57.44]Oh, the game is not sorcery, by the way.
[36:59.34]Hold on.
[37:01.98]So much, like, nonsense.
[37:03.24]I'd have to, like, change the actual name of the game.
[37:08.13]Sea Dogs.
[37:08.83]Is it even on Steam?
[37:11.85]I don't think it is.
[37:13.09]Well, there's Sea Dogs.
[37:14.81]Technically, I guess it is there.
[37:18.01]A version of it, at least.
[37:22.77]Let's change the title too.
[37:28.82]CDawg stream.

[42:17.53]So pretty stacked right now.
[42:18.90]And wanted to share the love.
[42:20.62]Any chance of seeing your unedited past streams on the second channel?
[42:25.92]Sorry, I had to take a second.
[42:26.68]I thought this girl was fucking strangling me.
[42:29.28]I thought she was putting her hands around my neck.
[42:30.62]I had to look at the other screen.
[42:33.32]But I love watching the VODs in my spare time.
[42:35.26]Yeah, I don't know.
[42:36.04]It depends on, like, if a lot of people really want to see that.
[42:38.88]Then I would do it.
[42:39.74]Or, like, maybe, uh, maybe Mackerel could do it.
[42:43.50]But that's not something I, uh... I don't know if I'll... Eh.
[42:47.39]I've always, like, not liked the idea of full VODs on my channel.
[42:51.75]She just, like, fucking shook her head at me.
[42:56.75]I'm stuck in the fucking door!
[43:02.21]My god.
[43:05.51]If I could take my sword out right now, it would go through this lady's head.
[43:10.01]I'm kinda sick of this already.
[43:15.78]Oh shit!
[43:16.36]I thought we were just gonna see a naked lady and I was about to freak out.

[45:21.67]That's Benjamin Franklin.
[45:23.97]You're a pretty cool dude.
[45:24.91]Thank you, thank you.
[45:27.18]Shawn Michael, you're a pretty cool dude too.
[45:34.72]High quality gameplay.
[45:36.35]What is this?
[45:38.11]Order of Malta.
[45:38.93]This has got to be where I find my long lost brother.
[45:40.95]I knew I wasn't going to get it right.
[45:49.39]There's so many people.
[45:52.64]There's so much information here.
[45:53.82]I've come to see my brother.
[45:58.94]Michael de Montfort.
[46:01.11]Michael de Maupre is under watch in one of the cells and held prisoner.
[46:04.85]So he's telling me Michael de Maupre is one of the guys that I walked by in the cells and said, I don't give a shit about you.
[46:19.10]One of the cells and held under the personal order of Chevalier Philip de Ponce.
[46:24.59]Descend down to the lower tier.
[46:26.87]You will find the casemates there.
[46:31.68]Where is that?
[46:32.28]What does that even mean?
[46:33.24]Is that here?
[46:34.04]Yeah, I don't understand either.
[46:42.70]I'm taking this guy with me.
[46:49.51]No, I'm not.
[46:49.87]It's way too difficult to move people.
[46:55.47]So I have to go back to the cells.
[46:59.93]What a crock of shit.
[47:02.48]Oh, wait a minute.
[47:03.20]Is it down here?
[47:03.96]There's just booze down here.
[47:08.98]Is that him?
[47:12.36]Um... Is that him?
[47:16.70]No, that's him.
[47:19.31]That's him.
[47:19.69]Found him.
[47:23.42]Okay, Charles, I'm not done yet.
[47:25.56]You had the gall to manipulate our father's feelings to serve yourself.
[47:29.48]So, you know, I came to this hellhole in this sweltering heat where the mosquitoes literally chew you to death.
[47:36.59]Not for you, but for our poor father.
[47:39.79]Really, Charles?
[47:40.47]Since when do you care about your family?
[47:41.83]Let's be honest, brother.
[47:43.15]Everyone in Paris knows who your father is.
[47:46.07]Who is your father?
[47:46.85]You may carry a family name of Des Moines, but you don't want to have De Momper named Dishonored.
[47:53.74]But in that case, you won't be able to use your lineage in order to tell everyone fictional stories about your heroic deeds, am I right?
[48:00.38]The doors of the best houses of Barry will be closed for you, and they won't let you come a mile closer to the law.
[48:07.22]Do you really believe that you... Are they just going to let us talk?
[48:10.86]Oh, a criminal.
[48:11.82]You're a criminal, brothers.
[48:14.12]A conflict.
[48:15.20]The conflict that's brewing between brothers.
[48:18.43]Oh, yes, straight from the bed.
[48:19.29]It's a married girl.
[48:20.55]Oh, am I correct, Charles?
[48:21.67]Hey!
[48:22.15]Hey!
[48:23.17]Alright, brother, we've bobbered words.
[48:25.79]That's enough.
[48:26.31]I agree that I'm not perfect, but you're no angel either, Charles.
[48:30.54]This really isn't the time to quarrel.
[48:32.32]We've both got one... We've got to say... Let's get out of here.
[48:36.44]Officially, it sounds like the expenditure of the society's money.
[48:39.07]It's much deeper.
[48:39.87]You've taken your organization's money.
[48:41.37]Shame of you.
[48:42.71]Yeah, I told you.
[48:43.57]Please, don't.
[48:44.25]Dear brother, I have to know right now.
[48:45.83]What do you think?
[48:46.71]Fine, I had received the money for a very dangerous and delicate operation which is supposed to shift political balance into the Caribbean.
[48:52.52]Oh, God, it's fine.
[48:53.98]How do you do?
[48:55.68]Yeah!
[48:56.76]One million?!
[48:58.00]You're kidding!
[48:59.04]Do I look like somebody in a joking mood, dear brother?
[49:01.20]God damn it!
[49:02.34]A million and a half?
[49:03.80]Ooh, that's gonna have to be a lot of money.
[49:05.90]God damn it, what the hell?
[49:07.54]Oh, yeah, what the fuck?
[49:09.04]This is... Sorry, brother, it slipped out.
[49:11.04]I said, fuck you.
[49:12.61]Let's proceed, brother.
[49:13.51]As I said, yeah, looks like I'm staying here for a while.
[49:15.83]I'm all ears, Michael.
[49:17.69]Just like... This is just so all over the place.
[49:24.98]A million bits.
[49:28.34]Yeah, one million bits.
[49:32.52]Okay, so... Let's make our way to the point.
[49:44.51]Okay, so we got all the way over here first to actually him to tell me what's going on.
[49:49.39]I'm willing to listen to your advice, but not your foul insults.
[49:55.71]You need to own a ship.
[49:57.99]You know that, right?
[49:58.77]Life is intertwined with the sea.
[50:00.21]A man with his own ship is an endless horizon of earning.
[50:02.27]But yeah, I'm a sailor.
[50:04.95]No, then it's time to become one.
[50:06.47]What?
[50:07.59]You've got no other choice anyway.
[50:08.85]You didn't think of becoming a port office clerk or registering into a garrison, did you?
[50:12.58]No, then you'll be a captain.
[50:14.66]What a turn of events in my career!
[50:16.68]And where will I find myself a ship?
[50:22.43]There's an excellent lugger held up on our shipyard.
[50:24.91]It isn't very big, but it's a very comfortable boat just right for making the first steps to be a sailor.
[50:29.93]It's only $5,000.
[50:30.52]I place a deposit of 5,000 bits with the help of my friends.
[50:36.06]Make your way to the local shipbuilder and tell him that Michael de Montparnasse sent you.
[50:42.58]So we gotta go to the local shipbuilder.
[50:48.42]Earn the rest $20,000.
[50:51.77]How do I get... This guy in jail is telling me all this stuff.
[51:00.02]There's money lying behind every bush.
[51:02.71]You got to know where to look.
[51:05.19]Zap him?
[51:06.61]No, really.
[51:12.11]Oh my lord.
[51:14.37]Titles mean shit here.
[51:15.99]Okay, my immersion's broken.
[51:18.97]Work, fight, steal just like anyone else.
[51:22.23]Hire a crew.
[51:24.49]You won't be able to steer the boat in the beginning, so you'll need a navigator.
[51:29.71]Oh boy.
[51:30.33]I gotta go to the tavern.
[51:33.05]I gotta...
[51:38.36]So I don't look like a moron.
[51:39.36]Okay, so what do I... Find a man there by the name of Fady.
[51:44.24]He owns his own house and his own mortgage.
[51:48.04]Repays that he lost quite... What do you mean to get... I can't take this anymore.
[51:56.70]I can't take this anymore.
[52:00.56]You'll be grateful later, brother.
[52:01.86]Finally, that crap again.
[52:03.26]I won't let you down.
[52:07.27]Oh, boy.
[52:11.25]Go to the shipbuilder.
[52:14.75]Wherever the hell that is.
[52:17.49]How do I even get to my inventory?
[52:19.20]I know I can do it.
[52:27.84]Like, where's the quest log?
[52:29.24]It keeps talking about a quest log.
[52:32.05]M?
[52:34.89]F2?
[52:35.03]Is it actually F2?
[52:42.32]I'm gonna change that to, like, J. I didn't want to take a screenshot.
[52:50.42]Alright, well, I... Oh, there we go, there we go, there we go.

[54:01.17]Going to the tavern.
[54:03.40]Okay.
[54:04.90]Let's put that away just for now.
[54:07.16]We're going to put that away.
[54:09.56]Just in case we need to cause any trouble.
[54:15.11]I'm so tempted.
[54:16.59]I'm very tempted to just fucking murder this guy.
[54:22.81]No, no, we gotta be smart.
[54:24.40]Let's get out of the fucking cell.
[54:29.58]It's so hard to control this game.
[54:36.17]I wanna do it.
[54:36.79]I'm gonna shoot him.
[54:39.05]How do I pull out the gun?
[54:41.85]No, I want to pull the gun out.
[54:44.87]Why am I swinging like there's a dump in my pants?
[54:47.70]Okay.
[54:51.04]There's no dialogue option.
[54:52.66]The game fucking crashed.
[54:59.20]Fuck.
[55:00.78]Fuck.
[55:03.20]Ugh.
[55:12.06]Right when it started to get interesting.
[55:14.83]Right when it started to get actually worth looking at and talking about.
[55:23.37]Close your ears.
[55:24.79]No, you never mind.
[55:25.26]It's okay.
[55:29.92]Continue.
[55:31.16]Time machine four.
[55:36.67]What?
[55:38.81]What?
[55:43.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[55:47.51]What the fuck is this shit?
[55:53.89]Um... None of the time machines can be, like, started.
[56:05.72]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[56:14.51]Oh, no.
[56:24.95]I don't care.
[56:25.47]45.
[56:25.49]Maybe we have to start a new...
[56:46.23]Fuck this whole town!
[56:56.14]Why can't I swing?
[56:57.88]Swing!
[56:59.26]Swing the sword!
[57:00.38]What the fu- What's that guy doing in the back?
[57:15.25]Hold on, I can do this!
[57:18.62]Do I have a gun?
[57:19.32]Don't I have a gun?
[57:36.60]Oh, that's it!
[57:37.54]You just die!
[57:41.66]You just die!
[57:44.07]There is no new game.
[57:51.90]Gunnery and musketry.
[57:57.99]Time machine 46.
[57:58.67]This time, I hope we have a gun.
[58:06.15]I picked a musket guy.
[58:13.32]Oh, what's that?
[58:14.56]Who is this guy?
[58:20.15]What?
[58:20.95]Why is this guy in the way right now?
[58:28.77]I just shot him!
[58:30.71]I just shot Friatuk in the back.
[58:33.09]I don't even know how I did it.
[58:34.13]I'm already dead.
[58:41.80]I'm dead already.
[58:47.33]I don't even know what the fuck that was.
[58:50.64]Alright, give me- I gotta give this one more shot.
[59:04.45]After a dangerous- After a dangerous- Oh no, there's another random NPC.
[59:14.98]Okay, save game.
[59:17.66]Save.
[59:19.02]Yeah, okay.
[59:19.50]You have to manually save everything.
[59:26.83]What am I doing?
[59:32.07]I can't get off this guy.
[59:37.48]I'm just fucking following this guy right now, and I won't stop.
[59:41.30]All I did is to take four screenshots.
[59:48.01]I can't get off of him.
[59:53.28]There's nothing to do.
[59:54.64]I have to follow this guy forever.
[59:55.72]I don't know what I did, but there's a loading screen.
[60:01.66]I'm just gonna follow this guy to piss.
[60:04.36]Look at the right.
[60:06.01]I turned into an NPC.
[60:07.09]No.
[60:14.64]Please, stop following him.
[60:20.85]I don't... Hold on, I think I got it.
[60:22.13]I think I got it.
[60:25.24]Nope, I didn't.
[60:26.10]I did not get it.
[60:31.90]I don't know what button I pressed.
[60:41.98]I keep following the acceleration.
[60:50.60]Okay, honest to God.
[60:51.68]Put it away.
[61:03.99]Put the sword away.
[61:04.85]I was just kidding.
[61:06.79]We're done.
[61:07.27]I'm done.
[61:07.87]I'm out.
[61:10.00]I'm done.
[61:14.93]I'm done.
[61:15.97]We're moving on.
[61:18.96]You wanna pull?
[61:20.42]Here's a pull.
[61:22.24]I'll give you a new pull.
[61:23.14]Am I gonna try this game again and actually try to play it?
[61:28.50]Or are we moving on to a different game?
[61:33.30]Because I don't know.
[61:34.22]I got locked out.
[61:39.71]I can't believe I fucking died.
[61:48.61]Alright, you guys can decide.
[61:49.93]Because I don't know.
[61:58.79]Here, here, what do you think?
[62:02.19]What am I doing?
[62:03.25]Am I doing a new game?
[62:04.46]Or am I trying it again?
[62:07.24]Am I going to give it a real, actual, real another try?
[62:23.98]Oh, boy!
[62:26.06]Seadogs.
[62:31.44]Wait, you guys didn't like Seadogs?
[62:36.71]So, everybody voted for this game and it sucked.
[62:41.81]Oh, that's too bad.
[62:48.15]Uninstall it.
[62:50.05]You know, there might be, like, a decent game there.
[62:52.03]Like, if you really gave it the time.
[62:56.33]Alright, let's open a new game.
[62:59.23]Let me, like, close this one.
[63:02.21]Fucking permanently.
[63:09.52]Hey, sometimes you gotta check.
[63:16.78]Sea Dogs is supposed to be, like, a good game.
