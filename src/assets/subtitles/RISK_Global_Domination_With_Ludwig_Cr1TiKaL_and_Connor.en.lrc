[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.11]Hey, what's up?
[00:07.24]Hey, what's up?
[00:10.62]How you doing?
[00:11.16]Hey, Germo.
[00:12.32]Good to see you.
[00:13.02]I'm a whole day early.
[00:13.92]I don't know what's going on with the schedule, man.
[00:20.12]I really don't understand.
[00:21.56]I mean, I don't have a schedule.
[00:23.62]What?
[00:24.20]What?
[00:27.22]The sus has been so wrong.
[00:28.98]I show up a day early or a day late.
[00:36.24]If the sus says like 4 o'clock on a Tuesday, I might just be... That means Monday at 8 o'clock Pacific or Thursday at 2 o'clock Pacific.
[00:48.99]The sus has been just so all over the place.
[00:52.19]But yeah, we're streaming right now.
[00:56.41]Let me just briefly go over what's going on before I hop on a call.
[01:00.79]First of all, hi.
[01:04.55]Second of all, gonna be playing Risk tonight.
[01:08.17]That's right, the board game Risk.
[01:11.98]online with other streamers.
[01:15.24]I believe so far, I believe we have, it's me, Ludwig, Conner Eats Pants, and Critical.
[01:22.31]So far, that might be it.
[01:24.47]That sounds like a pretty pog group, by the way.
[01:31.67]And then we're going to play DOS.
[01:36.28]So, that's the plan.
[01:39.21]Let me jump in this call.
[01:40.73]So I don't really play Risk that often, but I'm pretty good.
[01:46.45]Risk with a resident sleeper face.
[01:49.59]No, no, you can't resident sleeper Risk until six hours has gone by and everyone wants to go home.
[01:58.11]Gentlemen, how are we?
[01:59.35]I cannot hear anything.
[02:01.70]One sec.
[02:06.40]What happened?
[02:06.90]Why can I not hear anything?
[02:09.17]My audio is fucked up, man.
[02:10.99]Hold on.
[02:11.79]Hold on.
[02:18.99]How can I not hear this?
[02:24.43]Oh, my headphones are unplugged.
[02:27.15]I'm going to hire a pro audio technician.
[02:41.91]What is going on with this audio?
[02:46.74]Oh shit, I think I have like a DOS game open.
[02:51.98]I think a DOS game's open, that's what's going on.
[02:55.16]Hold on.
[02:57.70]Okay, we're good.
[03:08.43]If he has smoothies and stuff for nutrients, then maybe.
[03:13.10]But no calories at all?
[03:14.82]You just don't make that?
[03:20.11]I don't know how much he weighs.
[03:21.85]There's a couple people that have done no eating for like a year, but they were extremely obese and were fine, but they supplemented nutrients.
[03:30.11]I see.
[03:31.67]But Mr. Beast isn't like super out of shape or anything like that, so I just don't see him being able to pull that off.
[03:37.72]We got a good crew.
[03:38.96]This is a really good crew.
[03:39.94]I'm excited.
[03:40.96]German, what's the longest you could go without eating four Big Macs in a row?
[03:45.16]Without eating four Big Macs in a row?
[03:47.58]We'll just do your normal McDonald's order, I guess then.
[03:50.41]I mean, I get McDonald's maybe once every 10 days.
[03:54.67]I'd say probably... I'd say 11 days.
[03:56.67]That's actually pretty reasonable.
[03:59.31]Yep.
[04:00.03]That's fair.
[04:02.07]Uh, gamers, does everyone have Risk?
[04:04.61]Is it Risk Global Domination, the free one?
[04:07.31]Yeah, that's the one.
[04:08.15]Okay, I'm downloading now.
[04:12.05]Um, Ludwig, I don't know why you're so quiet.
[04:14.95]Oh, am I?
[04:15.63]I... Sometimes this problem happens.
[04:16.91]Oh, let me...
[04:18.39]is this better oh there you go turn myself up a bit I can hear you I don't have a cloud lifter that's why I thought that uh the music playing right now was I'm doing dos games after this I thought that I had dos games open in the background because this song is playing and I realistically thought it was like a midi dos game music it is what is it what else is it it's in something else
[04:46.60]But it is, it is a terrible, but also amazing song.
[04:50.92]Is that like... When was the last time anybody here played Risk?
[04:59.46]I've never played Risk.
[05:00.66]You've never played it, really?
[05:02.37]I've never played it.
[05:03.65]I had the old Risk game on the PlayStation 1 when I was like eight, but all I did was mash a couple buttons every now and then and gave up.
[05:14.27]I guess it's pretty self-explanatory, right?
[05:16.69]You just roll dice at each other?
[05:19.81]Yeah, I didn't even know they were dice in the game, so this is going to be real wild for me, I think.
[05:24.06]Are there, like, power-ups?
[05:27.14]Is this classic Risk, or is there, like, can you do wacky shit?
[05:35.67]Don't know what.
[05:37.57]Thanks for your sub, Kylor.
[05:45.13]Hey, I got Donut Walled.
[05:46.71]I got Donut Walled.
[05:48.80]It's alright.
[05:49.50]He's busy.
[05:50.02]He's setting up stuff.
[05:54.74]I know nothing about this game.
[05:55.86]Alright, let me explain.
[05:57.58]Very briefly.
[05:59.70]It's a map of the world.
[06:02.44]We get to place troops.
[06:05.38]For instance, I'm not going to say this on camera in front of them, but I'll say it on camera in front of you.
[06:11.40]Australia, if you hold Australia, you get to at least watch your friends destroy each other and hang out for like an hour and just sip like a Coke.
[06:19.03]That's what I used to do.
[06:20.75]I would just take, I would have Australia in that like southeastern region, which you could only attack from one place.
[06:28.16]And I would just drink like two Cokes and be able to at least participate for a while.
[06:31.60]So that's kind of what I'm going to try to do.
[06:34.22]But yeah, it's country.
[06:36.16]You claim country.
[06:37.46]Yeah, I'm in game.
[06:37.96]I'm ready to ride.
[06:40.25]I think there's probably a code we're going to use, right?
[06:42.64]I imagine.
[06:44.64]True.
[06:48.32]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[06:49.06]I went to get headphones.
[06:50.28]How the fuck are you guys?
[06:51.38]It's good to see you guys.
[06:52.56]I'm doing great.
[06:53.86]Yeah, doing great, man.
[06:54.94]Hope you're doing well.
[06:56.03]Yeah, it's been great.
[07:00.35]This game is loud.
[07:02.13]What is your strategy?
[07:03.25]What are you guys thinking of strategy?
[07:04.81]Because I have one.
[07:06.97]I've never... Well, no, I played this game one time.
[07:10.66]uh on the eighth grade field trip on the way on the bus on the way to dc um okay that was it none of the three of you it turns out haven't played this game much at all I mean no I actually have some experience I just played this all the time really I did I mean I can't say I'm very good but I I understand the basic kind of what's going on
[07:30.84]I've played a good amount of this game, but the reason I asked you three in specific is because usually the way it goes is alliances form and bitter rivalries start.
[07:41.64]But I picked the three people who I think I could never get mad at ever.
[07:46.41]Oh.
[07:47.11]In hopes that it will lead me to a global domination.
[07:50.41]That's really sweet of you to say.
[07:52.53]Also, the three least experienced players I know, which just was coincidental.
[07:56.67]Yeah, no, that's fair.
[07:59.52]Let's see how you feel at the end of this, Thump.
[08:00.90]Uh, okay, okay.
[08:03.80]Let me boot up, let me boot up.
[08:05.74]I take this, uh, I take this incredibly seriously, and, like, I'm sorry if you guys, if I say, like, talk a bunch of shit and call you names and stuff, I don't mean it.
[08:14.66]Oh, it's fine.
[08:15.40]That's what makes it fun.
[08:19.41]Do you think, do you call me a name, make it like a funny name?
[08:25.12]I'm excited.
[08:25.66]I haven't played this in a long time.
[08:27.92]So for rules, I'm going to turn off manual placement.
[08:30.38]It'll automatically place all of the things for us.
[08:34.10]The basic way risk works is we will evenly divide at the start all the territories.
[08:39.69]That means I can't pick.
[08:40.39]Random where you land.
[08:42.11]And then you have to move your forces around.
[08:44.43]It'll make sense when we're in it.
[08:47.59]Random is hard because you could be anywhere.
[08:51.90]I think the worst part about Risk, though, is placing ships and soldiers for, like, an hour.
[08:59.27]Yeah, it can take a while.
[09:01.33]Yeah.
[09:02.87]Do we know how to join yet?
[09:05.51]Yeah, I'm getting a code for you guys right now.
[09:07.95]Are we going to have to get this off the screen for a sec?
[09:11.53]I think I can just invite you guys.
[09:14.74]L Ludwig is online.
[09:16.78]Yeah.
[09:17.28]Are you offline, Connor?
[09:18.08]Not yet, are you?
[09:23.14]Alright, I invited Connor.
[09:28.14]Invites.
[09:28.76]Do I even have you on Steam?
[09:29.96]I pray, because we did that whole thing where we played like 18 games together.
[09:35.29]You used five tokens to join.
[09:37.55]Oh, wait.
[09:37.87]Here it is.
[09:38.19]Here it is.
[09:38.99]I used five of them.
[09:39.99]I bought the game.
[09:40.97]Should I not have bought this game?
[09:42.69]It was free.
[09:44.05]Yeah, but they said there was a timer for the amount of times you could play or something.
[09:47.35]I don't know.
[09:48.11]Oh, yeah.
[09:48.43]I think it's like a freemium model.
[09:49.85]I sent a code, by the way, in the chat.
[09:52.28]So you guys could join off that.
[09:53.52]I think I joined?
[09:55.28]Yeah, you're in Connor, you're in.
[09:57.84]I can't show my screen just yet, so no one sees the camera.
[10:00.48]Oh, they tripped me up on that one.
[10:02.58]It said, do you want a tutorial?
[10:03.80]I said no.
[10:04.44]Then it said, do you accept our terms?
[10:05.84]I said no.
[10:06.22]Now I'm kind of fucked.
[10:09.66]That was a big move from them, I'm not going to lie.
[10:12.80]You don't accept the privacy terms, so you just can't play.
[10:17.22]Now it knows I'm lying when I say accept.
[10:20.52]I believe we're all in.
[10:21.68]Are we good to go?
[10:25.76]Yeah, prepare for battle.
[10:26.58]Let's do it.
[10:32.68]Oh god.
[10:33.30]Okay.
[10:33.82]That's me.
[10:35.62]Is that like a family?
[10:36.80]No, dude, when I used to play Team Fortress 2, I used to have to hide my name because if people saw that it was me playing, they would just like five pocket medics would be on me and then eight snipers would join the other team.
[10:50.30]This is a messy map.
[10:52.48]Well, now they're gonna know your gas gun.
[10:53.90]Where am I?
[10:54.28]Colors are on the right.
[10:57.38]So, it's probably best for camera to be on the left.
[10:59.44]Okay.
[11:00.38]Top, left, middle-ish is both good.
[11:02.88]I'm red.
[11:04.26]Let's make it smaller.
[11:05.64]Do I need to do something?
[11:06.78]Yeah.
[11:06.94]So, the timer's at the top of the screen, Connor.
[11:08.74]That's your turn timer.
[11:09.64]You can see it moving.
[11:10.66]Right now, at the start of a turn, you have some troops you can place.
[11:13.74]So, you have to click on a blue territory and add troops to that territory.
[11:19.25]So, yeah, you just bulked up Eastern U.S.
[11:22.21]in Xinjin.
[11:23.79]Now you can attack, which is pretty straightforward.
[11:27.67]Usually, you want to attack anything with a lower number than your number adjacent to it.
[11:32.19]Oh, that makes sense.
[11:33.53]So, like, maybe you could attack Mexico.
[11:36.66]I can't attack Mexico.
[11:37.54]Let me do that.
[11:39.14]You could invade the rest of Russia with your Russian.
[11:41.38]Seems like I can only... Oh, I see.
[11:42.96]I see how you do it.
[11:44.16]Yeah, I'll take Mexico.
[11:45.92]You have to have at least...
[11:48.99]You have to have at least three... You have to leave at least one person on a country, right?
[11:52.51]That's how it works?
[11:53.19]Yes.
[11:53.65]Yeah.
[11:54.07]I would like Venezuela as your territory.
[11:56.69]Oh, okay.
[11:57.01]I should have done that.
[11:58.07]Yeah.
[11:58.29]So, it's a dice roll, right?
[11:59.45]And so, you just sometimes lose the dice roll, and that's how it determines if you win or lose the battle.
[12:04.14]Oh, I really want Venezuela though.
[12:06.02]Well, you could attack it again, and then again... No.
[12:09.80]You could use Peru.
[12:11.30]Be careful here.
[12:11.96]Hey!
[12:14.99]There it is.
[12:15.57]Getting too thin though.
[12:17.14]Great turn.
[12:18.38]That was a great turn.
[12:19.64]And now the final move you get to do is you get to move pieces to a final area.
[12:24.06]So if you wanted to like stack one area to be really strong, you could... I got the Venezuela card.
[12:30.76]You do get cards when you conquer a territory, and then you can use those cards and cash them in for big troop bonuses.
[12:36.35]This is going to be hard because... This is Ludwig.
[12:40.99]I will take over my home of Australia.
[12:45.50]I'm so mad that you decided to do that.
[12:46.96]That's exactly what I was going to do.
[12:48.78]What?
[12:49.32]Yeah.
[12:51.80]You're not green, are you?
[12:52.78]I am green.
[12:53.82]And now I can't... I can't even... I might as well just leave.
[12:56.79]I didn't know.
[12:57.75]I didn't know.
[12:59.17]If only I knew.
[12:59.87]Let me... Oh, this is tough now actually.
[13:02.97]What do I do?
[13:04.21]We're going Africa.
[13:05.27]I'll do this.
[13:06.65]I can definitely claim this completely.
[13:10.88]Do we want to attack the Philippine Islands?
[13:13.25]Wait, so why did you want to play with us if you said you can't ever be mad at us, right?
[13:17.73]You're just going to feel bad whenever you attack us now?
[13:20.07]No, I feel great about that.
[13:21.50]I feel bad losing.
[13:22.58]Yeah, that's the worst feeling.
[13:24.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:26.74]Oh, I got an Argentina card.
[13:29.00]So if you hold a continent, you get extra placement in the Fortify round, right?
[13:34.26]Yeah, I believe they'll tell you if you get the whole continent.
[13:37.06]But like if you get all of South America or all of Africa, all of US, any of those, you get like a bonus.
[13:44.19]Okay.
[13:45.19]What is the green, the right of the bottom of South America?
[13:48.39]What is that?
[13:49.65]That country?
[13:50.33]I have zero clue.
[13:51.69]They just made one up.
[13:52.73]Yeah, what is that?
[13:54.37]What is that?
[13:55.45]It's a Mauritius Islands.
[13:57.45]It's Atlanta.
[13:58.67]A Falkland Islands is what it's called?
[14:01.05]Mmm, Falkland.
[14:02.33]Oh, you can choose how much dice you want to roll, right?
[14:04.11]Okay.
[14:04.97]That's Atlantis.
[14:06.33]Yeah, you could, you could lower the amount.
[14:08.30]Oh.
[14:09.18]Hang tight, Egypt.
[14:11.06]All we got.
[14:13.08]No!
[14:13.78]That's the leader if I've ever heard one.
[14:15.98]No, now nobody, nobody go anywhere.
[14:17.78]Secure this because this, this is, this is border here.
[14:21.90]If you enter Europe, there will be repercussions.
[14:25.51]I'm trying to just, I'm trying to stay here in this, uh, in Africa.
[14:30.31]I'm trying to, I, I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to, whoever's here, I'm coming for you.
[14:36.09]No, you don't want, you don't want to fuck with Congo.
[14:37.93]I'll tell you right now.
[14:38.80]We're strong.
[14:41.78]Oh shit though.
[14:42.44]I have, who's blue?
[14:44.92]That's Connor.
[14:46.46]That's me.
[14:47.24]I can only roll two.
[14:50.35]Oh yeah, because you want to leave one on your island.
[14:51.79]Connor.
[14:53.37]Yes.
[14:53.55]Do I have to do something?
[14:54.37]Alright, you want to give me, uh, you want to give me Africa and I'll leave you alone in South America?
[14:58.49]Yeah, yeah, you can have it.
[14:59.70]Okay.
[15:00.84]An alliance.
[15:02.04]Okay, so.
[15:03.46]Do I, like, do I need to do something like give it to you?
[15:05.24]No, just, just leave next room.
[15:07.42]Oh, okay.
[15:08.16]Alright, I'm going to be aggressive.
[15:12.12]Wait, what?
[15:14.92]How do I...
[15:20.18]Wait, what are you confused on?
[15:21.08]You have to click the country you want.
[15:22.16]Somebody said, I'm glad Jerma finally made some friends.
[15:26.59]I've got fucking plenty of friends.
[15:30.93]You're in the top, Charlie.
[15:34.22]You're third through.
[15:35.06]Okay.
[15:36.81]I love you.
[15:37.87]I'm like a 7-year-old that's like going to school for the first time.
[15:42.15]Maxing out that to 7 and then taking like, you know, Northern Russia is a good idea.
[15:47.04]But you gotta go fast.
[15:47.70]You're losing time here.
[15:48.58]Alright.
[15:49.28]I'm taking America.
[15:50.00]Whoa!
[15:50.38]I didn't want to do it.
[15:52.68]Oh.
[15:52.96]Whoa.
[15:53.78]I feel threatened up there.
[15:54.84]Alright.
[15:55.42]You gotta go next to the bottom.
[15:57.04]Alright.
[15:58.14]And then you attack.
[16:00.02]Okay.
[16:00.56]I'm coming.
[16:01.78]Lovely Lady Liberty.
[16:03.31]The Canadians need to calm down.
[16:08.60]I own that.
[16:09.66]Whatever that is.
[16:11.52]What?
[16:12.64]What is this country?
[16:14.68]You got to attack Charlie.
[16:17.74]I got one.
[16:18.20]The quickest one, although it's less measured.
[16:22.93]I think I'm getting it.
[16:25.67]It's Greenland?
[16:26.99]2v2.
[16:27.57]Let's go.
[16:29.01]This is not Greenland.
[16:32.88]So wait, if you have one, you can never fight like two, right?
[16:37.27]Yes.
[16:38.75]One can never fight because they have to stay home.
[16:41.09]So then you roll for like, what's the random aspect?
[16:45.78]Like when I pick somebody to fight.
[16:47.54]To fight your two troops, we both get two dice?
[16:50.18]Yes.
[16:51.37]And if your die rolls are higher, you win.
[16:53.99]But if mine are higher or it's a draw, I win.
[16:56.43]So I think there's an attacker's advantage.
[16:58.06]Maybe it's a defender's advantage.
[16:59.70]And you have to move at least three troops if you attack with three die.
[17:05.22]I'm going to give Ukraine four troops because I stand with Ukraine.
[17:09.75]So the strategy is if you roll with one die against somebody with one, you won't have to take all your troops.
[17:19.64]It's Defender's Advantage.
[17:20.56]I lied.
[17:20.82]Sorry.
[17:21.02]Excuse me.
[17:23.81]So, wait.
[17:24.43]Chairman, what did you want me to do?
[17:25.97]I'm... Okay.
[17:26.85]I'm willing to let you have whatever that green spot over there is.
[17:31.45]Oh, the Falklands.
[17:32.54]Yeah.
[17:33.08]You take that, but I want... So, do I attack it?
[17:35.08]Attack it.
[17:35.62]Alright.
[17:35.88]Well, what you could do is you could attack... Who's red?
[17:38.02]Is that a... A Madagascar.
[17:41.20]You could help me out there and knock that down a little.
[17:44.72]I think you should go for bottom left, Connor, because then you get all of South Africa, or America, and you get a bonus.
[17:49.17]So you should attack the Falkland Islands.
[17:50.91]But you have to go quick.
[17:51.51]Your turn's almost over.
[17:52.19]Oh, okay.
[17:56.41]And then move all your troops, so then Germa will come in.
[17:58.89]You see how it's, like, blue outlined?
[18:01.09]Like it's a YouTube thumbnail?
[18:04.03]Yeah.
[18:04.63]A booger just came out of my nose when you said that.
[18:06.27]I don't know why.
[18:08.41]I swear to god.
[18:10.03]Oh.
[18:10.49]Okay.
[18:12.43]Alright, alright.
[18:14.51]Time?
[18:14.99]So my whole turn is done.
[18:17.47]Oh, I should not have done this.
[18:22.87]You know what?
[18:23.35]Let's just keep it simple.
[18:26.63]Let's just send three.
[18:27.66]The Kiwis are too strong.
[18:30.02]Told ya.
[18:30.76]Wow!
[18:31.54]Yep.
[18:32.68]I'm sending two.
[18:34.52]Not enough.
[18:35.30]We need a whole army.
[18:39.57]And I will not attack you in South America, Connor, because I appreciate our alliance that we have forming here.
[18:46.23]There's no way New Zealand could just go all the way over there.
[18:49.31]Connor, I don't appreciate the diplomacy with this other general here.
[18:54.64]He can't get me to travel.
[18:57.62]We couldn't even get over here.
[18:59.02]Your boats would sink.
[19:01.04]Okay, since you threatened us, we've decided to attack.
[19:03.26]I didn't threaten you.
[19:03.70]I just said your boats would sink.
[19:05.28]Well, to prove that our boats wouldn't sink, I came and attacked.
[19:08.81]That's not cool.
[19:09.19]That's not cool.
[19:10.85]I'm just trying to show you that if you give me a little lip, then I will attack.
[19:14.81]I dare you.
[19:16.35]See what happens.
[19:17.03]They're crazy down there.
[19:18.79]You haven't even heard of them.
[19:20.23]I refuse to be goaded.
[19:21.44]It's perfect.
[19:23.78]All right, let's fortify.
[19:25.06]Let's fortify up.
[19:28.85]Uh, and let's, let's actually, let's bring him back home, huh?
[19:33.03]Oh, ooh, wow.
[19:35.17]So if you see in the, in the middle of the left, by the way, you get these cards.
[19:38.63]And if they're all three the same or all three different, you get a different bonus.
[19:42.94]It says it on the right.
[19:45.76]You can cash them in.
[19:46.56]All right.
[19:47.02]I'm going, I, I gotta, I gotta get a, I gotta get, this is Madagascar.
[19:50.46]I'm going for it.
[19:52.17]No.
[19:53.37]Have mercy.
[19:54.21]I've got to have Africa.
[19:55.73]I need those points.
[19:56.79]Charlie, you win this.
[19:57.52]Don't even be worried.
[19:58.62]Oh, yeah, I do.
[20:00.32]Let's go, baby.
[20:00.98]No.
[20:02.08]Hold on.
[20:03.84]That one didn't count.
[20:07.96]Not enough.
[20:09.89]All right.
[20:10.33]Come on.
[20:11.01]1v1.
[20:11.25]It's 1v1.
[20:11.91]1v1.
[20:13.11]Let's go.
[20:13.65]Oh, I thought I won.
[20:15.47]I thought you did too for a second.
[20:18.95]All right.
[20:19.27]Okay.
[20:22.69]So now I gotta be careful because... Lovewick, you're orange, right?
[20:30.40]I am.
[20:33.42]He's not a nice guy.
[20:34.38]I am a nice guy.
[20:36.25]I reply to diplomacy very well.
[20:39.35]The people of Argentina disagree.
[20:42.13]The people of Argentina can suck it.
[20:44.29]Whoa.
[20:53.04]I didn't know I had such a presence up there in North America.
[20:57.70]I've been also ignoring all my troops up north.
[21:04.64]I feel good.
[21:07.44]Oh, man.
[21:09.71]How does that?
[21:10.83]I'm coming in again.
[21:11.51]I don't really know what I'm doing, but this feels good.
[21:14.45]You're not doing bad.
[21:15.05]It's a 1v2 here, though.
[21:15.99]It's kind of a risky fight.
[21:17.15]Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
[21:18.35]Why is it?
[21:19.01]How do I back out when that happens?
[21:20.29]I'm just going to keep swinging on everything.
[21:21.81]I've gone mad.
[21:24.36]I like how you thought about asking and then just said, screw it, I'll just fight everything.
[21:29.98]I'm doing it live.
[21:31.44]Charlie, I will stay here with Iceland and be a barrier for you.
[21:36.88]Yeah, I wouldn't attack here, Charlie, because you're going to lose a lot of troops.
[21:41.16]You might want to fortify them and bring them south and try to attack the Mexican border.
[21:45.32]That sounds like something an enemy would say.
[21:47.27]Oh, I had it.
[21:49.61]Yeah, I had it.
[21:51.73]I see.
[21:52.61]I didn't have a choice.
[21:55.73]I'm willing to be kind of a shield here for you.
[21:58.25]To make it so nobody can come in.
[22:00.75]How do I fortify?
[22:02.92]Click on the place you want to bring troops to, and then, yeah.
[22:06.04]Geography.
[22:06.84]Alright, so do I use my cards right now?
[22:10.16]You can decide.
[22:11.24]Your cards, I think you have to have three, and they have to be matching.
[22:14.06]Oh, I see.
[22:15.64]And I would tell you right now, don't tell everybody if you have a match, because people will know that you're about to drop cards to get troops.
[22:23.07]I see.
[22:24.03]Yeah, I don't have any matches.
[22:26.54]I believe it's one of the same three or one of each, right?
[22:31.66]I have like zero matches.
[22:34.96]Oh, there we go.
[22:37.64]I'll do that.
[22:39.57]Going for the whole U.S.
[22:40.65]here, huh?
[22:41.51]Oh, I lost?
[22:43.91]Well, that sucks.
[22:45.35]East Coasters fight strong.
[22:47.49]We're fine.
[22:47.99]Everything's fine.
[22:51.31]charlie it's looking rough I think you might have to focus on uh on europe but no ludwig how did you get this many troops already europe hasn't been attacked and I'm very sad in australia I said your borders are weak in the chat ban that guy please get him out of everywhere bottom here he doesn't have a youtube damn it only fortify over or can I fortify the ones
[23:21.57]Because you can't leave.
[23:23.49]Because if they left, then the territory would be open.
[23:26.07]Oh, I'm like moving people adjacent.
[23:27.87]Okay, now I get it.
[23:29.31]Yeah, fortifying is basically moving troops from one section adjacent to another section.
[23:33.90]Oh, shit.
[23:34.20]You can only move many numbers to small numbers.
[23:37.94]Cool, I did it.
[23:38.56]Is there a report feature in this game?
[23:41.06]What would you be reporting?
[23:44.59]Who's reporting?
[23:46.04]If you click on people's avatars, you can, like, make an alliance.
[23:49.14]Like, report this user.
[23:50.64]Is that what that is?
[23:52.18]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[23:52.98]Presumably, if they're acting awry, I guess.
[23:58.78]Watch out, by the way.
[23:59.44]Give me some reports later if you come from Argentina again.
[24:03.63]Ludwig, you're doing the exact same thing I want to do.
[24:05.75]This is like the guarantee that you can hang out with your friends for an hour and like watch them just destroy each other while you just drink like a coke.
[24:13.16]And then eventually when everybody gives up, you're fine because like you at least got to hang out with your friends for a little while.
[24:18.22]I have a nice iced coffee here.
[24:22.88]Charlie, what do you want to do in Europe here?
[24:24.60]Glad I held on to that one until I was on the call.
[24:29.11]I am a big Scandinavia fan.
[24:31.17]And you're a big Scandinavia fan.
[24:32.81]I love that for you.
[24:35.57]Charlie, what if I give you a proposition here?
[24:39.23]Wait, I messed it up.
[24:41.09]I clicked the wrong one.
[24:43.01]Let me help you get Asia.
[24:48.97]Hear me out.
[24:49.53]I'm going to show you.
[24:50.45]Look up north.
[24:52.21]We're going to get real thin soon.
[24:54.91]We're going to spread real thin.
[24:56.79]And you can have this whole territory.
[24:59.00]And then maybe you just back out of Asia.
[25:00.74]You see how these are all ones?
[25:03.32]I give you free reign to kill all these troops.
[25:07.27]Ah, that's very generous.
[25:09.41]Yeah, you know, I just figured it'd be nice.
[25:13.73]And I get Europe, you get Asia.
[25:15.97]It's a simple deal.
[25:18.59]Let me marinate on it.
[25:19.47]I'll talk to my board of war generals.
[25:22.45]I unfortunately have some bad news for everybody over in North America.
[25:26.94]Listen, there was a mistake.
[25:28.86]Our alliance was very short-lived.
[25:31.84]I'm about to potentially have eight troops up here, and I'm about to come all the way through North America, and I would like to be talked down, by the way.
[25:41.10]Please don't do that.
[25:42.28]What if you didn't?
[25:45.54]The only reason our alliance ended was because I thought that your character model was Ludwig because I thought he looked the most like Ludwig.
[25:52.12]That's fair.
[25:53.80]That's hurtful to me.
[25:55.06]I don't think it's fair.
[25:56.27]Are you just fortifying no attacks?
[26:04.75]What is he thinking?
[26:05.93]I don't know.
[26:06.41]I'm trying to think.
[26:07.45]Let's go.
[26:09.09]Wow.
[26:10.78]Holy shit.
[26:11.86]You made a strong enemy today.
[26:14.21]You took Australia.
[26:17.45]I told you that before the call started.
[26:19.13]I typed a DM in Discord.
[26:21.19]Hey, dude, I don't really know what I'm doing.
[26:23.07]Can I have Australia?
[26:24.05]And you're like, yeah, that's cool, bro.
[26:25.58]And then you just took it.
[26:26.30]So I'm going to fucking attack.
[26:28.40]I thought Africa would be good enough for you.
[26:29.88]I'm sorry.
[26:30.66]I thought that would be good enough.
[26:31.94]And I think you also needed Australia.
[26:35.54]Clearly you have some British roots here.
[26:38.04]Never satisfied, huh?
[26:44.12]Didn't you pee on food earlier?
[26:45.22]I peed and then ate food.
[26:50.80]Someone did say you peed on my food earlier and I was confused why you would do that.
[26:57.69]A lot of people are really confused right now.
[27:02.40]All right, Charlie, you're going for America.
[27:03.90]Oh, you got seven.
[27:04.94]Oh, damn.
[27:05.42]You might be able to clean the whole continent up.
[27:07.85]Yeah, it's looking good for me.
[27:09.51]I think you can move south and eliminate Connor's troops.
[27:12.97]And I'll eliminate Jerma and Greenland for you.
[27:15.27]Don't do that.
[27:17.49]You can say I'm going to try.
[27:19.30]You can't say it's guaranteed.
[27:21.96]We hold strong here in the western United States.
[27:24.86]This is where I do my best work.
[27:26.54]Very patriotic over there.
[27:29.38]This is a pretty...
[27:32.52]50-50 chance.
[27:33.34]I feel good about my odds here.
[27:35.66]50-50, baby.
[27:40.70]Why did I lose and I was three against one?
[27:43.71]I lost repeatedly with three against one.
[27:46.71]But he didn't lose once.
[27:49.51]Yeah, that is a good point.
[27:51.29]He's kind of crazy with it.
[27:52.74]So it's always better to fortify your troops at entry points, which there's a lot of in the U.S., but it's mostly Greenland, and you don't have to worry about that because I'm taking care of it.
[28:00.26]I can only... Oh, I see.
[28:01.96]It's only adjacent ones.
[28:03.40]Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[28:04.46]I'm going to roll the dice, Ludwig.
[28:08.86]Let's see how it works.
[28:12.52]There we go.
[28:13.42]All right, Connor.
[28:14.86]I'll figure this out.
[28:16.10]Don't count me out.
[28:35.38]Connor, wouldn't it make more sense to get the south first?
[28:37.68]You just gotta trust me here.
[28:39.12]What a shitty leader this is.
[28:41.84]I'll make an Elijah with you!
[28:43.94]I'm kidding!
[28:44.96]Like, what am I, in the fucking fourth grade?
[28:46.72]Like, you can't... Yeah, I don't know why, uh, Connor, I keep... I keep doing the thing where I put my hand out, and when you go to shake it, I, like, put my hand up and put it over my hair.
[29:02.15]I don't know why I keep doing this to you.
[29:05.21]all right it happens what is earl I'm taking earl we needed an earl boys uh I can only move people there apparently oh wait that's what I wanted to do you got to break up australia that's just just free two troops every time
[29:28.03]Okay, you're sitting with Africa, and you're saying, like, I have a smaller continent.
[29:34.36]There's, like, five borders here on Africa.
[29:37.30]You have one that can be attacked.
[29:39.90]When I tell you I am sitting on an infantry, cavalry, and artillery, I mean it with the utmost sincerity.
[29:45.61]Oh, all right.
[29:49.35]Oh, I didn't get the fortify.
[29:51.19]I see now.
[29:51.69]I get it.
[29:51.97]Let's do this.
[30:01.94]Guys, we might need to unite here.
[30:10.08]Because this is kind of getting a little ridiculous, don't you think?
[30:14.57]Yeah, it's getting a little scary.
[30:15.85]I mean, he's coming in here.
[30:18.19]Whoa.
[30:19.32]Greenland.
[30:20.28]Yeah, yeah.
[30:21.14]Not worried about him though.
[30:21.90]Not worried about him.
[30:23.72]He's coming for you, Charlie.
[30:24.84]Like, this is not... No!
[30:26.42]Oh, yeah.
[30:26.98]Yes, he is.
[30:28.32]Slanderous.
[30:29.02]Charlie, when I am attacking Alaska, I do it with the absolute plan of leaving it for you, alright?
[30:35.34]I'm not even... I'm not even interested anymore.
[30:38.62]Okay, fuck yeah.
[30:42.11]And I'm just going to fortify some troops right over... Maybe here's good.
[30:47.55]It's a good section, I think.
[30:50.09]It is.
[30:50.63]And I insist you get the rest of America here, Charlie.
[30:55.31]Yeah.
[30:55.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:56.25]I think that's the play.
[30:58.03]Can you have your men just stand down?
[31:00.67]I could do it next turn, not this turn.
[31:03.35]Okay.
[31:04.37]Hey, Ludwig.
[31:05.65]Uh-huh.
[31:08.65]Oh, no.
[31:13.11]There's no winners.
[31:13.81]I'm French.
[31:15.21]We never surrender.
[31:16.21]It's our thing.
[31:17.11]Well...
[31:19.00]Where are all your troops, though?
[31:24.21]Oh, shit.
[31:27.69]Where'd they go?
[31:28.29]Looking pretty thin there, Jerma.
[31:33.61]Looking pretty thin.
[31:34.99]I am looking a little thin, but guess what?
[31:36.66]I'm not going to let you sit here with 11 troops sitting here on the coast.
[31:40.34]It's not going to happen.
[31:41.54]You thought I was going to attack.
[31:42.74]No, they're tourists.
[31:46.70]They're just passing through the Mediterranean.
[31:51.53]Okay, that's a threat.
[31:53.45]Oh, it very much should be taken that way.
[31:55.19]A lot of troops in India, huh?
[31:58.79]I thought it was more of a pacifist nation that happened to have nukes.
[32:05.41]Well, you understand, fellas, he's trying to just amass like 30 troops in Europe so then he can just go out and just get everybody.
[32:13.74]This is his plan.
[32:15.28]What?
[32:16.88]I resent this.
[32:18.14]I took... I got... I got in the way there.
[32:21.70]That's what happened.
[32:23.97]Charlie, I would throw some troops.
[32:27.15]Take down any of my ports.
[32:29.05]They're all for you.
[32:30.55]You want Greenland or Alaska?
[32:33.51]The southern border seems to be the most... Liar.
[32:35.79]He's a liar.
[32:37.11]I'm taking the southern border here.
[32:42.37]Um...
[32:43.80]Who do I want to fight, though?
[32:45.84]You should fight Ludwig.
[32:46.92]He's been like a bully and like a bad guy.
[32:49.14]I'm moving my troops out.
[32:51.11]Yeah, he's giving me NA.
[32:53.09]We've already formed the alliance.
[32:54.45]I think maybe... Maybe just make some moves over here.
[32:59.87]I'm kind of just being like an annoying notification on Connor's phone at this point.
[33:06.34]You could get the area in the top right where I am.
[33:09.62]Because then you'd have the border that connects to the U.S.
[33:12.96]How do I... Oh, you're right.
[33:15.10]You're right.
[33:15.94]The one that connects to Alaska.
[33:17.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:17.96]That's a good place.
[33:22.03]All right.
[33:22.43]Now I'll just hang out.
[33:23.43]Hold North America's a lot.
[33:26.61]You get, I think, five each turn, right?
[33:29.35]Yeah, America's juice.
[33:30.41]I think it's one of the biggest.
[33:32.73]It's in Asia, which is impossible to hold.
[33:34.37]Mm-hmm.
[33:41.82]Ganner.
[33:43.03]Ganner.
[33:43.51]A lot of troops in Europe, Ganner.
[33:46.29]Oh my god.
[33:46.71]I could literally... What?
[33:49.77]Are you considering?
[33:51.25]Connor, the whole time was a joke.
[33:52.35]I know I've been pinging you a lot of times.
[33:56.31]I sent you a request.
[33:58.13]I got this, guys.
[34:03.05]What do you got exactly?
[34:04.19]I got a big plan here.
[34:11.10]I'd recommend.
[34:11.74]Okay, fair enough.
[34:13.26]Do you want a recommendation here?
[34:22.07]Oh.
[34:22.29]I'm not going for New Zealand.
[34:25.85]Wait, did you?
[34:26.65]A little too late.
[34:27.41]I like those guys.
[34:32.05]Oh, there's four.
[34:35.21]All right.
[34:36.53]Oh, no.
[34:37.69]Not Perth, though, huh?
[34:38.62]Leave Perth alone.
[34:40.53]how do I go back uh you can't unless you fortify oh they're coming charlie he's coming fortify uh how do I do this I don't know I don't know where I'm moving okay I say the turns are short where do I want to go yeah well they're 120 seconds I don't want to make it on her because yeah yeah we're just slow
[35:09.42]I mean, it's pretty thin though, right?
[35:11.62]I could like just kind of... No, but I have an alliance.
[35:14.24]I could get 10 troops instantly if I wanted.
[35:16.28]I could go through Europe.
[35:17.47]You know what?
[35:17.95]Let's do a play here.
[35:19.55]I could go down here.
[35:20.63]Like through here.
[35:21.23]Well, two troops.
[35:23.87]Two more.
[35:25.79]This is so vulnerable though.
[35:26.85]Like I can't just leave this.
[35:27.43]You're not witnessing the plan here.
[35:28.43]It's all right.
[35:33.39]It's all right.
[35:37.76]Okay.
[35:38.22]Well, now you're in a lot of trouble because that plan now, you attacked.
[35:41.88]We're, by the way, Connor and I are working together.
[35:44.74]We have an alliance.
[35:47.60]Got some strong troops down there, Connor.
[35:50.17]Yeah, they're really energized after we did the Argentino.
[35:54.55]Those are the Argentinians.
[35:55.83]They moved over there.
[35:56.65]Okay.
[35:58.13]That's right.
[35:58.53]That's right.
[35:58.87]Next turn, we're going to go sicko mode.
[36:02.31]Me and Charlie are going to go crazy.
[36:04.27]Yeah, that's when we're gonna get wild.
[36:06.57]Charlie, check the bottom left to make sure those cards... You might have a... Yeah, I might have a little something.
[36:13.05]Something in the tank, you know?
[36:13.93]Something to really take out someone else.
[36:21.19]13?
[36:21.51]Let's go.
[36:23.47]Holy shit.
[36:26.31]Okay, I'm getting this back, first of all.
[36:29.11]You know what?
[36:29.49]I now respect you for that.
[36:30.85]Honestly, I got it as more of a motivation for you than anything.
[36:35.01]I could see that.
[36:35.73]And by the way, you could request an alliance if you wanted to.
[36:40.37]I wouldn't mind because I feel like South America is an enemy of both of us.
[36:43.51]I'm going to need a confirmation on that, by the way.
[36:47.75]Ludwig, I'm just still going.
[36:48.83]I haven't seen a notification on my screen yet.
[36:51.44]A notification is sent!
[36:52.38]A notification is sent!
[36:54.10]Avoid Iceland!
[36:55.68]Okay.
[36:56.60]Let me think.
[36:57.08]Oh, okay.
[37:01.72]I will accept this alliance if you can do the first one sentence of the 4Kids one-piece intro.
[37:12.70]The original intro?
[37:13.52]The 4Kids version.
[37:16.44]And I have to sing it?
[37:17.42]You have to sing it.
[37:18.70]Just the first part.
[37:20.33]That's all I'm looking for.
[37:21.05]I promise.
[37:22.54]There was a man named Gold D. Roger who was the king of pirates.
[37:26.74]He was wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
[37:29.72]That's enough.
[37:30.12]And these were his final- That's enough.
[37:32.05]No.
[37:32.43]No lines.
[37:33.57]What do you mean?
[37:34.55]That's enough.
[37:36.95]That's abuse of power.
[37:37.89]It's abuse of power.
[37:38.67]That's enough.
[37:39.95]I was- I'm sorry.
[37:40.87]Honestly, I was looking for a yeah, yo, yeah, yo, but yeah, I didn't get it.
[37:44.31]That's not the first line then.
[37:48.83]I didn't get what I wanted.
[37:49.98]It's like the seventh line.
[37:51.36]Like the seventh.
[37:58.34]I would've Gaio Yayo'd like all day, chat.
[38:01.80]I would've been one of the biggest Gaio Yayoers.
[38:04.44]Charlie, it's your turn.
[38:05.15]You're- you're- Yeah, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
[38:09.27]He actually did the intro.
[38:11.57]The- the- the- Alright, I might have to give him another chance.
[38:15.99]Give it up, give it up.
[38:21.32]Oop.
[38:21.44]Where you heading?
[38:36.42]He's not attacking anybody.
[38:37.56]He's being like a nice guy.
[38:40.01]Consolidation.
[38:40.99]I like that.
[38:42.39]You could move the three and the four in Europe, or you could move the two in America to add to the one, to the five, four, I mean.
[38:49.55]So it's five?
[38:51.27]Yeah.
[38:53.08]Like the Montreal Mandis to the California carries?
[38:58.28]Why does it go back?
[38:59.16]Wait, how do I make it at five?
[39:00.60]I can't move them down.
[39:03.01]Really?
[39:04.43]Yeah.
[39:06.59]Well, that's not bad.
[39:08.30]That's not bad, so.
[39:10.56]You guys with more than three cards, doesn't the amount of troops go up?
[39:16.04]It's not progressive.
[39:17.02]It's fixed.
[39:17.60]Oh, okay.
[39:17.88]It's fixed.
[39:19.86]Connor, it seems like you're adding a lot of troops around me.
[39:22.14]Yeah, I am.
[39:23.32]Connor.
[39:24.98]Why?
[39:26.88]The Argentinians are pissed, man.
[39:28.84]I told you.
[39:29.44]I'm surprised that the guy from the Yoinky Splinky GIF would have a Twitch channel.
[39:40.30]Because we're defending our homeland?
[39:43.30]They're just really upset.
[39:44.38]That's the one that goes... I've seen it.
[39:50.63]Consider this.
[39:57.66]That's right.
[39:58.06]Wow.
[39:59.20]Wow.
[40:02.86]Now you're just fighting a fight.
[40:05.96]We're just going all over.
[40:07.12]I'm actually kind of getting scared of Connor.
[40:10.50]You've made a grave mistake today.
[40:13.14]This might be where I turn.
[40:14.10]This is the heel turn on Connor, I think.
[40:15.46]I'm figuring out how to play this game.
[40:20.39]Oh, okay.
[40:26.99]Game of Thrones.
[40:27.79]Connor here.
[40:31.99]Should I do this or should I wait?
[40:36.95]Let's do it.
[40:37.31]Let's do it.
[40:40.09]Only six?
[40:40.59]I thought it was ten.
[40:45.38]No, I'm holding those other ten.
[40:47.14]Oh, okay.
[40:47.46]I see.
[40:48.22]For like a later arrangement of sorts.
[40:56.24]Oh, there's a lot of troop movement down there.
[40:59.84]Easy win.
[41:02.02]Shit.
[41:02.46]Easy win.
[41:04.58]They're fighting hard.
[41:05.42]You've pissed them off.
[41:07.56]They're quite upset.
[41:09.68]What is going on?
[41:10.36]Oh my god.
[41:10.96]You're getting destroyed.
[41:12.83]That was quite the war.
[41:14.07]Alright.
[41:16.25]Well.
[41:21.41]Alright, man.
[41:24.41]Alright.
[41:25.27]Well fought.
[41:37.66]Okay.
[41:38.66]I should have... Chad, I should have... You should have what?
[41:44.52]I... Talking about... Thinking of the members... Thinking of the Prime.
[41:54.71]You don't have that.
[42:02.93]Whoa.
[42:05.65]Not cool.
[42:07.68]Whoa.
[42:08.82]Wait, that's my ally.
[42:10.38]Oh, wait a minute.
[42:12.21]I want to rethink your allies here.
[42:13.81]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[42:16.13]A bit blood hungry here.
[42:17.41]Oh, stop.
[42:19.67]Hey, hey, hey.
[42:20.39]I misclicked.
[42:24.25]You misclicked three territories.
[42:26.33]I need new glasses.
[42:28.34]I think that's the problem.
[42:31.70]Yeah.
[42:34.88]Alright, well you really need glasses if you think you're gonna beat me in Greenland.
[42:40.68]Or Iceland.
[42:41.76]Fuck!
[42:42.00]Okay, um... Just trying to, uh... Connor, sorry, what happened was... I forgot to tell you, I was gonna send you, uh, you know, documents about it that we both signed.
[42:51.69]Mm-hmm.
[42:53.23]Um, about how I was gonna come through Europe.
[42:56.16]I just did, uh, the FedEx must have not have got it through in time.
[42:59.62]Oh, okay.
[43:00.00]Yeah, I mean, the people would have, like, appreciated, like, a little warning.
[43:03.67]Yeah, it kind of feels to me, Connor, from an outsider's perspective who is totally unbiased and a journalist in degree and nature, that he was attacking you and lying.
[43:14.65]I mean, that would be pretty crazy.
[43:19.61]Honestly, look at the border that you and I have here in South America and Africa.
[43:25.07]I could have gone that way and broke up your points and stuff.
[43:28.38]I just was trying to claim the territory here.
[43:33.34]I don't understand you mentioned it look connor you come through asia I that's all right I'll let you that's fine with me oh okay really yeah then why did you re-fortify india to to the middle east all right whoa western us let's calm down I would no don't bring them all over oh charlie no all the alliances are gone it seems
[43:56.98]Charlie, you brought them all over.
[43:57.94]I would fortify and bring them back.
[44:01.38]I have absolutely no defense against that, by the way.
[44:04.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[44:05.97]Oh, yeah.
[44:07.37]This is the dream, then.
[44:08.59]He caught me red fucking handed, and I just didn't talk, so we're moving on.
[44:13.11]I win that.
[44:13.79]That's cool.
[44:15.25]That's right.
[44:16.27]It's not over.
[44:16.70]It's not over.
[44:18.73]Oh, that's a slaughter.
[44:20.77]Keep going.
[44:21.99]One more.
[44:22.29]One more.
[44:22.53]Connor, you're losing every round.
[44:24.95]There we go.
[44:27.05]Secret strat is you break into their first border so they don't get their bonus.
[44:30.79]That's big.
[44:31.65]All right.
[44:31.93]I like that.
[44:32.63]Don't go down there.
[44:33.73]Don't go down there.
[44:36.60]You're out of time.
[44:37.30]No.
[44:38.22]Oh.
[44:39.61]Wait.
[44:39.97]Oh, I see.
[44:40.81]Oh, no.
[44:41.53]Oh, no, Charlie.
[44:42.31]The good news is, since you didn't break in, he can't use the three troops that are just big chilling in Peru.
[44:49.89]True.
[44:51.47]Actually kind of genius of you in a way.
[44:54.71]Oh, God.
[44:55.77]Wow.
[44:56.49]That's big.
[45:02.89]I can easily reach some catfish.
[45:04.75]We're pulling for you, by the way, over here in Australia.
[45:08.54]I appreciate the brothers overseas.
[45:13.35]What is it?
[45:13.65]I don't know what I'm doing.
[45:14.87]You're losing.
[45:16.57]Charlie, you kind of had a bad draw too.
[45:18.14]You started like half in Canada, half in Asia.
[45:21.18]It was kind of a hard draw.
[45:22.16]Yeah.
[45:22.78]Chad was saying I got a really bad start, but I've also never played the game, so I didn't really do anything right either.
[45:29.26]I mean, what I'm witnessing is absolute soldiers.
[45:32.34]Yeah, these are warriors here with a pure heart.
[45:35.10]Fighting the tyranny of oppression.
[45:36.91]No.
[45:37.03]There we go.
[45:56.57]What a mistake.
[46:00.37]I look over at the camera sometimes and I'm just like, I'm like the Grinch.
[46:04.91]What am I going to do here?
[46:07.55]Oh, you're going to attack the Argentinians again?
[46:09.58]Yes.
[46:10.16]Yeah, I bet that'll come back to bite you.
[46:11.38]They're going to piss them off.
[46:13.70]Wait, you're going across the ocean here?
[46:17.48]Oh, now they're livid.
[46:21.29]This is a very bad play, Ludwig.
[46:23.05]You barely can hold the territory.
[46:24.42]There's like insurrections everywhere.
[46:25.84]That's what I say to them.
[46:27.44]You want to talk about bad plays?
[46:28.52]Check this out.
[46:29.14]Occupy the whole thing.
[46:30.48]Check this out, JermaEatsPants.
[46:33.33]That's not us.
[46:34.99]Come on!
[46:36.93]Nope.
[46:37.19]Not gonna happen.
[46:38.55]Yeah!
[46:46.53]Do you see what's right next to you, though?
[46:48.31]Do you see the big 1-0 that's right there that's about to just steamroll all the way through Europe here?
[46:56.17]I think that may have been a mistake.
[47:00.97]No.
[47:05.09]You're dumb.
[47:11.30]Oh, I could not have been a better card.
[47:14.18]There's no way we just got that card.
[47:16.42]There's no way we just got that card.
[47:18.08]Oh, guys.
[47:18.58]I just checked my card.
[47:19.86]Did you guys see this card that I got?
[47:21.56]Okay.
[47:22.06]You got one card total.
[47:23.24]You guys see this card that I'm holding?
[47:25.72]Feels like this is a lie.
[47:27.76]This card is insane.
[47:29.20]Oh, my God.
[47:29.78]Why do you know we hold strong in Portugal?
[47:33.23]We hold strong in the UK.
[47:36.33]Oh, no.
[47:36.65]This whole thing's coming down, man.
[47:37.87]I'm sorry.
[47:42.44]We don't budge from Iceland.
[47:49.89]Are you attacking Connor?
[47:52.53]No.
[47:52.77]Don't attack that.
[47:53.49]That's like... I don't even know.
[47:54.35]I'm going to be honest.
[47:55.01]I had nuclear five guys up there.
[47:56.45]I just learned that.
[47:58.69]I had not seen them the whole game.
[48:00.37]Okay.
[48:00.89]Well... Don't attack them because they're... They're cool, I think.
[48:03.97]Okay.
[48:04.79]I'm not going to get the bonus if that exists though.
[48:08.29]We can like... We'll figure something out.
[48:09.81]I'll like move them.
[48:10.77]Okay.
[48:12.73]All right.
[48:13.19]Okay.
[48:13.49]That sounds good to me.
[48:14.63]All right.
[48:14.89]We all misclicked, Jerma.
[48:15.99]That's the thing.
[48:18.19]Greenland is North America, right?
[48:19.51]Technically, like, it's... Where is it?
[48:21.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:22.06]It's in North America.
[48:22.84]It's not part of it.
[48:23.70]Well, I'm going to make it so you can't fortify this because I know you're going to turn cards in and put, like, 30 troops here.
[48:26.92]I wouldn't do that.
[48:27.90]I wouldn't do that to you.
[48:28.60]That's absolutely what you're going to do.
[48:30.12]So I'm going to go back here.
[48:31.32]Oh, I get the bonus if I hold a continent.
[48:34.64]And I'm going to make you have to have the really kind of hard and annoying decision of needing to potentially go through Charlie to get over here, which you're not going to do that.
[48:45.15]You guys have an alliance, right?
[48:46.07]You made a big mistake.
[48:48.82]Huge.
[48:53.50]History will remember your errors.
[48:58.02]Hawaii would never attack the Western United States.
[49:01.20]Well, I think they're reclaiming it.
[49:04.88]If you want to bail on America and go Asia, Charlie, I wouldn't blame you.
[49:11.31]All right.
[49:11.77]Well, might as well just hit Japan.
[49:13.09]Because fuck it.
[49:19.04]Because the US is looking thin and there's... There's a lot of territories in Asia to win here.
[49:29.08]Asia is pretty spread out, pretty thin, huh?
[49:32.05]And Europe.
[49:35.55]And Africa.
[49:36.11]Oh shit, that's all me.
[49:42.15]I think I'll take care of the southern part of China if you want to go for the northern part right now.
[49:46.42]No, no, no, no.
[49:47.68]Yeah, no fortify.
[49:48.42]I think it's also good.
[49:50.47]Why can't I take... Oh, my God.
[49:52.25]Why can't I take troops from there and put them in Japan?
[50:00.44]It should be just one.
[50:02.48]If they're connected, that's weird.
[50:16.84]oh I just do not understand what's happening it's called the new argentinians I don't understand though like what I'm looking at why am I losing because you're rolling dice and if the dice number is lower I thought it was higher though well mine were higher than those and there's one like joker die that looks lower but what is blitz what does that mean people are saying it's used blitz
[50:42.21]It's like an attack that basically just rolls for you automatically several times.
[50:47.53]I love it.
[50:49.33]Instead of individually rolling each time.
[50:51.47]Oh, okay.
[50:54.73]But it sends all your troops, so it can be devastating if you lose.
[51:00.38]Oh, okay.
[51:00.78]I see.
[51:02.40]It's just auto-attacking, yeah.
[51:06.24]Good job.
[51:06.66]Hey!
[51:09.36]We were holding up over there.
[51:10.75]Okay.
[51:13.24]I just need one good card.
[51:15.43]I don't know why Connor's headhunting me so hard in this one.
[51:17.81]I don't know.
[51:18.27]I don't know.
[51:18.81]I don't get how this works.
[51:21.23]I just got a clicking or whatever it lets me click on.
[51:26.15]Uh... Oh, I ran out of time.
[51:30.12]I know exactly what he's going to do.
[51:31.18]He's going to try to come from... He's going to New Zealand over... No, I know he's going to do that.
[51:35.46]I was trying to figure out how to like fortify it.
[51:37.36]I was clicking on the wrong thing.
[51:39.92]I think my plan...
[51:43.25]is a little deeper than you might expect.
[51:45.83]Hmm.
[51:48.01]Okay.
[51:48.15]What are you doing?
[51:52.83]You're leaving that many?
[51:59.78]Don't do it.
[52:00.90]Don't do it.
[52:04.18]Don't do it.
[52:05.42]Come on.
[52:06.64]You're not gonna make it across.
[52:09.19]No.
[52:09.97]No, you're not gonna make it across.
[52:14.33]Don't do it.
[52:15.81]Stop right here.
[52:18.11]Got it.
[52:21.64]This is perfect.
[52:24.66]Perfect.
[52:29.76]I told you not to fuck with them.
[52:31.24]I'm falling apart.
[52:34.06]Yes!
[52:34.30]That was huge though.
[52:35.50]Oh, next turn.
[52:36.12]Next turn, boys.
[52:40.50]Oh my god.
[52:40.94]He got... Oh, if I could... If I could have... Okay.
[52:44.96]Alright.
[52:45.30]Okay, the good... Okay, we... I've got an idea as well.
[52:55.63]Um... Ludwig, you're actually in a lot of trouble right now.
[53:00.49]You made a big mistake.
[53:02.75]Huge.
[53:03.59]I don't know.
[53:04.03]I don't think so.
[53:05.73]You don't know how high I can fly.
[53:08.83]I've seen that movie.
[53:11.09]Hey, Charlie.
[53:11.57]I'm going to let you have Asia if you just say Ludwig sucks.
[53:16.53]Oh my god.
[53:17.22]I can't do that.
[53:18.56]You'll have to just take Asia from me.
[53:20.86]I could never betray an ally.
[53:22.00]You can just have it though.
[53:24.86]No, no.
[53:27.82]You're not going to continue.
[53:29.99]You're not going to... It's a mistake to keep going.
[53:35.81]One more and it's over for you.
[53:40.35]Whoa.
[53:41.79]Jesus.
[53:42.71]I'm just saying, Ludwig has almost nothing on the board at this point besides Australia down here.
[53:48.75]So, I mean, like, somebody could literally just swoop in.
[53:50.75]I mean, like, Charlie, I know you have an alliance here, but from Japan, if you fortify that, you've got a pretty good idea here, I think.
[53:57.87]That's true.
[53:59.17]Well, I'm in a good position strategically.
[54:01.03]I also control all the anime exports.
[54:03.65]That's true.
[54:04.83]We've been longtime partners in buying a lot of anime up from you, okay?
[54:08.53]It's been buy, buy, buy.
[54:10.60]The trade is heavily in your favor.
[54:12.04]I wouldn't get rid of me as a partner.
[54:13.88]Oh, no.
[54:14.24]I completely agree.
[54:15.12]It's been an invaluable partnership.
[54:16.80]Hey, German.
[54:22.25]Yeah?
[54:23.99]See those five guys up there that would give you Europe?
[54:26.27]Mm-hmm.
[54:27.47]Can I move them to Greenland?
[54:30.42]Absolutely.
[54:30.86]All right.
[54:50.07]You're fucked, you're all ones?
[54:53.43]Look at everybody else, though.
[54:54.59]If I get to keep some of these, I'll get a lot of cards.
[54:57.56]Just making Japan the strongest nation?
[54:59.54]Yep.
[55:00.18]I'm locking Japan down.
[55:01.78]I love that.
[55:06.24]There's actually a lot of ways you can go from Japan, too.
[55:08.34]So that's like a pretty central area.
[55:10.04]Yeah, it does get Australia, Asia, and US.
[55:15.42]Yeah.
[55:17.86]Noticing a lot of green on this map, fellas.
[55:19.87]You want to talk about that, Connor?
[55:22.99]Uh... I mean, yeah, he's my ally.
[55:25.63]He's, like, cool.
[55:26.71]What if we make an ally ship?
[55:29.55]I'll... Before you make a move... Let him talk.
[55:33.03]Consider my words.
[55:35.91]But, like... I don't think so.
[55:39.14]I haven't even told you what my plan is.
[55:41.18]What's your plan?
[55:43.38]You just lost all your troops in that fight.
[55:45.38]Shit.
[55:48.39]They just wanted to show you that they were pissed.
[55:52.71]Yeah, that's fair.
[55:54.99]Connor, leave me Alberta.
[55:57.28]No matter what.
[55:58.12]Oh, thank God.
[56:00.70]Connor, you gotta ask for his Crunchyroll login info.
[56:04.90]His Crunchyroll?
[56:05.46]Oh, yeah.
[56:06.26]What's your Crunchyroll login?
[56:07.22]That's the deal.
[56:10.76]The price is too heavy.
[56:12.62]Devastating.
[56:13.68]He's a tier one just chiro.
[56:17.14]All right.
[56:18.28]This is going to be tough for everyone.
[56:25.46]Let the record show I tried.
[56:27.80]Dude's got five territories.
[56:33.86]Don't laugh at that, Jeremy.
[56:34.82]It's not that.
[56:35.85]It's hurtful.
[56:36.85]Well, it's funny because I was attacking you, so I feel good about that.
[56:40.49]Me and Connor are.
[56:41.77]Yeah, he did that.
[56:42.93]Imperialist of you.
[56:45.49]Is it?
[56:45.97]Oh, is it my turn?
[56:46.99]Yeah.
[56:47.26]Oh, yeah.
[56:47.54]Oh, my God.
[56:48.38]Oh, my God.
[56:48.68]Oh, my God.
[56:48.94]Oh, my God.
[56:49.20]Oh, my God.
[56:59.26]Go ahead.
[56:59.69]Put them in New Zealand.
[57:01.07]I dare you.
[57:01.77]Okay.
[57:05.17]I dare you to attack Argentina.
[57:06.71]I dare you.
[57:09.45]Oh, you want the southeast back, dad.
[57:14.81]For two troops a turn.
[57:32.92]Okay.
[57:33.62]You can have it.
[57:37.87]Psyche.
[57:38.95]Oh, okay.
[57:40.23]I just did like a concerned face in my webcam.
[57:41.97]Gotcha.
[57:43.07]Gotcha.
[57:43.99]Oh, that's good for me.
[57:44.97]That's good for me.
[57:51.19]I can't make it to K-Town.
[57:52.33]It's spreading myself too thin.
[57:55.41]Plus, the more green around me, the worse things go.
[58:00.17]More money, more problems.
[58:02.13]You know what I mean?
[58:02.59]That's true.
[58:09.81]All right, Connor, I need this.
[58:11.29]I need your... Yeah, take the one up there.
[58:13.71]The little one guy.
[58:14.69]Okay, I don't want to put too much.
[58:20.13]Okay, I got to hurry up.
[58:21.59]Yeah, I was giving you the one guy.
[58:22.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[58:27.78]What are you doing?
[58:30.52]Time's ticking here.
[58:33.36]South Africa.
[58:34.50]Okay.
[58:35.02]What is this place?
[58:37.40]Please, I don't want you steamrolling in here.
[58:42.08]The Falklands will never fall.
[58:44.84]You just gave them up.
[58:47.84]No, they're fine.
[58:48.66]He's all of Europe and Africa.
[58:50.73]How many is that per turn?
[58:54.71]Plus eight.
[58:57.43]He gets plus eight from that.
[59:02.19]Oh, my God.
[59:03.90]Oh, my God.
[59:05.54]I'm looking at the troop output right now.
[59:08.22]Connor, 18.
[59:09.12]Me, 22.
[59:09.94]Charlie, 17.
[59:11.04]Jerma, 34.
[59:11.74]He's got as many as Charlie and Connor combined.
[59:16.34]How do, uh, how do you finish the game?
[59:19.42]Uh, you don't, you own the world.
[59:21.04]Somebody has to win.
[59:22.88]Oh.
[59:23.56]Charlie, big head.
[59:24.54]I understand now.
[59:25.91]I thought there was like a turn thing.
[59:28.29]All it takes is, is, is, yeah, this is where it starts.
[59:30.71]This is where it starts to get kind of annoying.
[59:31.81]This is where I come.
[59:32.73]There's a problem.
[59:34.96]Big Man, I'll take care of South America.
[59:38.00]Okay.
[59:38.54]I'm going to grab Alaska from you.
[59:40.24]Yeah.
[59:40.60]Please.
[59:40.90]Please.
[59:42.18]That's perfect though.
[59:43.14]You got to go quick.
[59:43.56]You got to go quick.
[59:44.74]Perfect.
[59:47.26]We're fine over here, guys.
[59:48.10]What the fuck?
[59:48.88]You guys are going to go quick, Charlie.
[59:50.32]I am.
[59:50.82]What the fuck?
[59:52.24]Use the Blitz function.
[59:53.70]This is Blitz.
[59:54.42]This is Blitz.
[59:54.94]Is this not Blitz?
[59:55.58]No, you're doing the individual dice.
[59:56.72]You got to go right.
[59:58.52]Oh.
[59:59.50]Bring it back.
[59:59.98]Bring it back.
[60:01.05]Oh, no.
[60:01.35]The time.
[60:02.80]Charlie, the time.
[60:04.04]I'm going.
[60:04.56]I'm out.
[60:05.24]What the fuck?
[60:05.84]Why did that go?
[60:06.82]Tom, I'm out.
[60:07.80]Fortify, fortify.
[60:08.52]You're good.
[60:08.80]Just fortify.
[60:09.88]Tom, I'm out.
[60:10.98]Next turn.
[60:12.10]I don't understand what's happening.
[60:13.91]You could bring him over to Asia, honestly.
[60:15.19]It's not a bad idea.
[60:16.05]Ditch the US.
[60:17.23]Too late.
[60:18.03]I got four troops.
[60:21.97]You watch out.
[60:22.83]Oh, no.
[60:23.47]He just uses cards, Chet.
[60:25.03]Yeah, I use the cards.
[60:27.87]Well, then.
[60:29.37]Okay.
[60:34.28]Okay.
[60:38.86]The scariest part is Jeremiah has five cards.
[60:42.82]You should not be scared.
[60:45.86]That was the most terrifying thing you've ever said.
[60:49.75]You should have heard your tone right there.
[60:51.57]Was it scary?
[60:52.85]Yeah.
[60:53.61]Oh.
[60:54.41]It's like a horror movie.
[60:55.19]You're like, you should not be scared.
[61:03.73]You know, I've never won a game of Risk in my whole life.
[61:07.93]Really?
[61:08.47]Never.
[61:09.25]Because the way you're playing Connor for a fool right now makes me double-check that.
[61:15.60]I'm... Where did you get that from?
[61:18.86]Are you kidding me?
[61:21.68]You have him as your... He gave you Falkland Islands.
[61:25.08]He has no territory of two.
[61:27.10]It's been the worst partnership in the history of partnerships.
[61:30.45]I've seen worse.
[61:32.20]Well, no.
[61:33.32]South America.
[61:34.32]Connor's held South America for like the whole entire game.
[61:36.82]I haven't gone over there.
[61:39.17]We've been trading stuff here.
[61:41.43]Alright, I have to make this move.
[61:49.35]For the betterment of my people.
[61:51.36]That's a little cringe.
[61:52.14]Everybody's cringing at you, like all the viewers.
[61:57.90]Actually, it's kind of crazy.
[61:58.68]It's ridiculous, yeah.
[62:00.20]Well, everybody's like looking at you funny right now.
[62:02.60]They're not doing that, right guys?
[62:03.44]You're getting really weird looks.
[62:05.88]I don't feel like that's... I hope that's not the case.
[62:07.66]I just got a text from my mom.
[62:09.95]What does it say?
[62:14.91]Ludwig is cringe.
[62:16.55]Send that message.
[62:19.05]I mean, she's not... Is she wrong?
[62:21.67]First of all, happy Easter, mom.
[62:23.82]Happy Easter.
[62:24.56]Have a good Easter.
[62:26.94]I agree.
[62:28.42]And then they're like, they're like tongue hanging out crazy.
[62:31.80]Like the face, right?
[62:33.78]You don't use emojis like that with your mom.
[62:36.40]What?
[62:37.34]You use the tongue out crazy face emoji in a casual conversation to your mom.
[62:43.77]It's kind of like a silly emoji.
[62:45.01]I feel like that one's fine.
[62:49.23]It's like that ahaha XD.
[62:52.51]I've seen my mom use that emoji.
[62:53.89]Do I have to post it in chat?
[62:58.47]Jeremy, it's my turn.
[62:59.27]It's your turn.
[62:59.81]Okay.
[63:00.23]Excuse me.
[63:02.76]You said the emote before?
[63:03.92]Hold on, I got... Oh, I... You're wasting time here.
[63:07.86]No, I just wanted to see it.
[63:09.04]By the way... Excuse me.
[63:13.72]I'm not fucking around now.
[63:16.42]No, we win this fight.
[63:17.10]We win this fight.
[63:17.98]No, you don't.
[63:18.80]Oh, Dylan!
[63:20.74]Yes!
[63:22.80]They did pretty good there.
[63:24.16]Yeah, that was a very well-fought group.
[63:27.25]You can do this!
[63:29.35]For Jakarta!
[63:31.47]Fight!
[63:34.91]Blast!
[63:35.87]Thanks for not breaking the alliance, man.
[63:39.49]The people there appreciate it.
[63:45.87]That was huge.
[63:46.46]That was huge.
[63:51.41]We can stomp Connor out of the Americas.
[63:53.65]Yeah, that's the plan.
[63:54.79]But I've also got good strats.
[63:58.54]Oh, I love this.
[63:59.62]Japan to, oh, Mike, the wraparound Alaska.
[64:02.90]Oh, the door reach around.
[64:04.72]We're going to be all right.
[64:06.06]Oh, my.
[64:07.91]Everything's fine, guys.
[64:08.89]Connor, you assured me.
[64:10.27]You assured me that you were going to be able to handle North America.
[64:15.35]No, I said I'd be able to handle Argentina, and then that didn't work very long.
[64:20.80]I said the Falklands, and to be fair, they're still there.
[64:23.82]They are, yeah.
[64:26.40]They are actually still there, you're right.
[64:30.28]Oh, this is actually kind of bad.
[64:33.01]You left Mexico.
[64:34.29]Wait, how do I go?
[64:34.91]Wait, I can't go back?
[64:36.09]No, when you were traveling north, you had to have left troops in eastern US.
[64:41.99]Oh, what the fuck?
[64:42.91]It's okay, it's okay.
[64:43.53]I'll sweep through.
[64:44.05]I'll sweep through.
[64:45.25]I'll finish the job.
[64:46.07]I'll finish the job.
[64:47.55]Chin up, King.
[64:48.55]It was a great fight.
[64:50.37]My Argentinian troops will demolish him.
[64:53.34]He will only have Asia as his frontier.
[65:05.30]Unlucky.
[65:07.15]Connor, you got cards?
[65:09.03]Alright, alright.
[65:10.15]There we go.
[65:10.61]There we go.
[65:11.49]There we go.
[65:34.86]Well, this really decides how the game's gonna play out here.
[65:38.12]However this goes.
[65:44.46]It's an error.
[65:45.30]It's an error!
[65:48.06]Oh, an Absolute Wonder!
[65:52.46]Yes!
[65:53.24]Oh, that's bad.
[65:55.62]You shouldn't fight this, Connor.
[65:56.88]You shouldn't fight this.
[65:59.09]Well, what if like I did?
[66:01.10]I don't know these are some rabid warriors out here I don't know what they're capable of that was a mistake I I don't know why I feel like you're eating with your hands right now like you're eating like chicken with your hands
[66:23.05]You got one giant turkey leg that they serve at Disneyland.
[66:25.99]I just have it here.
[66:26.87]You're just sitting there eating chicken wings, and you've got barbecue sauce all over your hands.
[66:30.57]Is that accurate?
[66:32.03]I'm not even holding the bone.
[66:33.17]That's the worst part.
[66:33.75]I'm just holding the meat part of it.
[66:38.53]Jamma, jamma, jamma.
[66:39.91]Hi.
[66:41.69]You have made several errors today.
[66:45.40]You're probably aware of that, though.
[66:50.95]Someone said Ludwig is 100% a Disney adult.
[66:56.07]Not a Disney adult.
[66:58.41]I just happen to go to Disney a lot.
[67:00.34]Oh, man.
[67:00.68]Whoa.
[67:01.16]Chill.
[67:01.54]Uh-oh.
[67:05.28]Leave him alone, man.
[67:07.86]Charlie, I leave you the rest of North America to take care of.
[67:10.47]All right.
[67:14.15]That was too far.
[67:16.20]You're gonna go with 3v3?
[67:17.08]No, you're not.
[67:18.20]That would be weird.
[67:20.16]That was too far.
[67:20.90]I don't even need to.
[67:21.58]That's the thing about it.
[67:23.08]That was a little... A little cringe is what people are saying.
[67:25.98]Let me check my phone.
[67:28.34]Don't check your phone again.
[67:29.86]It's a message from Dad.
[67:31.60]No, it's not.
[67:33.46]What'd he say?
[67:33.96]I can't get into my email.
[67:36.54]I need help getting back into my email account.
[67:38.56]I don't fucking know, Dad.
[67:39.48]Like...
[67:40.35]Okay.
[67:40.77]All right.
[67:40.99]Just a regular.
[67:41.69]That's not bad, though.
[67:42.41]Yeah, it's not bad.
[67:42.97]My dad said Ludwig is cringe.
[67:44.65]That's not... At the exact same time, he happened to message you.
[67:48.29]Yeah, he said that.
[67:49.63]Coincidentally, in the exact same minute that Jerma's father texts Jerma.
[67:54.86]It's not that big of a coincidence.
[67:55.90]I mean, things happen.
[67:57.10]It's an awfully large coincidence.
[67:58.72]You don't dare go through that.
[68:00.04]All right, I'm here.
[68:01.06]You don't dare do this, Jerma.
[68:02.92]There's a Prime Keebler in the...
[68:06.57]I want a German.
[68:07.67]How about an alliance?
[68:08.51]Hey.
[68:08.83]Oh, okay.
[68:09.69]Hey, what's going on here?
[68:11.01]What is it?
[68:12.53]What is it?
[68:12.89]Connor failed you in the Southern front.
[68:16.06]I can hold South America and leave you Africa.
[68:19.92]I will also heed Europe to you.
[68:22.00]I won't interrupt.
[68:23.46]You leave me some... Don't believe his lies.
[68:25.66]I'm not even going to listen at all.
[68:27.15]I mean, this is just like... The tone of your voice was like, I'm doing... I'm making this up.
[68:31.75]Yeah.
[68:32.95]The tone of your voice was, I'm making this up.
[68:35.33]I will literally sing any song you want if you don't go any further.
[68:40.05]I would actually take that deal.
[68:41.77]Firework.
[68:42.35]Firework.
[68:42.79]Firework right now.
[68:44.38]Baby, you're a firework.
[68:48.06]That's pretty good.
[68:49.12]He's trying to have a pretty good job.
[68:54.32]Okay.
[68:55.52]Alright.
[68:56.26]Thank you.
[68:57.34]You're welcome, man.
[69:00.18]Alright, I'm satisfied.
[69:01.56]Do you have Pepe Pains on YouTube?
[69:03.84]Oh, yeah, we got that.
[69:06.84]Yeah.
[69:17.75]I'm seeing mostly feel strong man's over here, though.
[69:19.83]Why do you bring it up?
[69:20.85]People are, there's a lot of Pepe Pains.
[69:22.67]Right, right, right, right.
[69:23.81]Next time, he's going to have to drink a glass of milk when he does it, too, at the same time.
[69:29.83]Otherwise, I'm invading.
[69:37.56]Hey, Charlie, what about an alliance?
[69:40.36]Charlie, you got to get rid of that five.
[69:42.31]Yeah.
[69:43.47]You could, you could attack on both six fronts though.
[69:46.18]Like you could pepper him down with the Alberta troops.
[69:49.00]Finish him off with the, with the Montreal.
[69:51.28]No, they're good.
[69:51.78]They'll stand strong.
[69:52.90]I'm going in.
[69:53.98]Oh no.
[69:54.70]No, they're good.
[69:55.74]Stay strong boys.
[69:57.18]Stay strong.
[69:58.28]That's us.
[69:59.02]Just barely.
[70:00.20]I can't.
[70:00.62]Oh my God.
[70:02.09]Stand strong, Mexico.
[70:04.29]Interesting thing you can do is leave nothing but Mexico.
[70:08.39]Honor, I'm going to have to eat you.
[70:09.19]You're going to have to what?
[70:10.81]I'm going to have to eat you.
[70:11.48]I think I'm going to have to eat you.
[70:13.22]You might have to, but I think I'll be okay.
[70:16.72]I think so.
[70:17.18]It really depends what's going on here because if somebody kills you, they get your cards.
[70:23.67]Well, I don't have any good cards.
[70:25.67]I mean, look, if I consume you, I might get a match, and then I could take them both on.
[70:31.19]Connor, how are you even handling this negotiation?
[70:33.90]You said ooh to him eating you.
[70:37.06]Yeah, I mean, we lost the Falklands.
[70:40.12]We're kind of in a low morale.
[70:41.70]I mean, you could do, you get something to do in Asia here maybe, but I'm afraid that Charlie's going to eat you, and then Charlie's going to get your cards.
[70:50.05]All right, that's fair.
[70:51.74]What do you mean this is fair?
[70:52.56]He's eating you and you're saying that's fair.
[70:55.24]Well, we lost the Falklands, man.
[70:58.16]He lost his will to fight.
[71:00.84]This is Stockholm Syndrome.
[71:02.10]You lost to Jerma and now you're saying it's fair that he eats you.
[71:06.24]I missed them.
[71:09.36]Japan, let's go!
[71:10.88]Connor, I'm going to have to eat you.
[71:14.97]I don't like Japan, guys.
[71:18.35]Alright, guys.
[71:18.71]I'm going to fortify here.
[71:22.66]Can I just, like, can I, like, get, like, a boat and, like, move all of Asia to Mexico?
[71:28.88]Just get everybody out somewhere.
[71:30.64]Where's the boat card?
[71:32.12]You actually might be okay.
[71:33.68]You actually might be okay.
[71:39.52]Jesus.
[71:40.92]What do I do?
[71:43.96]If you go down to, like, two territories, though, Connor, I might have to eat you.
[71:48.21]No, that's fair.
[71:51.42]such a bad fight to take I have to do it I have to do it come on baby yes all right well you lost a lot you lost a ton I don't even want to hear your words the people of the southeast hate you what do you think you're a terrible leader you just killed like all of them you know this is nobody even in australia even watches your stream
[72:15.25]Like, they watch my stream, is what I've been told.
[72:18.13]No, many Australians enjoy content.
[72:21.97]I just think it's bullshit.
[72:27.84]Gnar.
[72:29.00]They didn't even have TikTok there.
[72:33.66]Damn it.
[72:33.94]Okay.
[72:35.40]All right.
[72:35.76]This is so ugly.
[72:39.95]There's just so many ways I can get... Okay.
[72:42.21]Okay.
[72:44.12]I've got to go for this.
[72:46.00]If I can get this done, then I can get it done.
[72:47.76]I'm going to try.
[72:48.42]Oh man.
[72:54.36]There it goes.
[72:56.75]I've got to go for it.
[73:05.79]Nice.
[73:11.11]Defend the Mexican border.
[73:12.39]If you attack, I return.
[73:15.45]Are you going to attack anyways?
[73:16.53]No.
[73:19.80]Hang strong, Americans.
[73:21.74]I don't know if I want to do this, though.
[73:25.28]If you push America, that is my ally.
[73:27.52]Oh, I think I can get the game now.
[73:32.81]When I kept fighting, I kept losing everybody.
[73:37.21]You kept just having one person in a whole area, and you'd have a huge area with one troop max.
[73:43.58]I thought people wouldn't feel threatened.
[73:46.06]They'd be like, oh, there's just one guy there.
[73:54.54]Can I trust you to handle Greenland, Charlie?
[73:57.82]I don't know if I can take Greenland just yet.
[74:01.62]I think I'm going to just need to grab Mexico first.
[74:03.98]All right, grab Mexico and amass troops.
[74:06.80]I will distract Jerma.
[74:09.84]Stand strong, Mexico.
[74:17.15]You have some kind of plan.
[74:25.11]I trust the one guy there.
[74:28.17]Imagine this one dude beats six troops.
[74:32.59]All right.
[74:33.55]Wow.
[74:34.01]He fought valiantly.
[74:35.59]Jesus.
[74:35.75]He did a good job.
[74:40.28]He died with honor.
[74:44.52]Oh, I have a plan, chat, and it is...
[74:50.03]merciless, actually.
[74:52.07]Connor, you have an opportunity to... Here's the play.
[74:55.30]Do you want me to tell you what the play is?
[74:57.00]Or do you want to back and forth here?
[74:59.88]If you go after Charlie right now and thin him out, I could eat him.
[75:07.65]That's true.
[75:08.09]Alright.
[75:10.25]I could go across North America, get those cards, and I could get your cards, too.
[75:16.87]It's good.
[75:19.10]It's not good.
[75:19.74]His plan always involves killing you and you keep saying it's good.
[75:22.68]That's diplomacy.
[75:26.58]We lost our will.
[75:29.26]You're like a robot.
[75:33.28]Not Japan.
[75:35.51]Hang strong, Hawaii.
[75:39.83]Yeah, go team.
[75:42.10]I'm just being real.
[75:42.74]Okay, if Connor had the territories that I have, I would be saying the same.
[75:46.52]I'd be like, look, come get the cards from me and go on.
[75:50.23]And our alliance can go on to victory.
[75:52.99]It won't even give me an option to fortify.
[75:54.93]There's nothing to fortify.
[75:56.23]It's all a bunch of one guy.
[75:58.23]Connor, it's been a pleasure playing with you.
[76:02.28]You're not going to knock me out this turn.
[76:03.84]No, he's not.
[76:05.28]Everybody would be like, that's cringe, Ludwig, if you did that.
[76:07.72]Oh, my God.
[76:11.31]That's a lot though.
[76:12.05]You're not going to be able to go all the way up.
[76:15.29]28 guys?
[76:17.25]That's not cool.
[76:19.23]Shit.
[76:20.21]Don't do it Ludwig.
[76:21.41]He's got to do all of this.
[76:22.83]He's going to spread out.
[76:23.51]No.
[76:23.77]It's not going to happen.
[76:25.35]You got to like leave me Hawaii.
[76:28.19]You never deserved Hawaii.
[76:32.35]You got to leave me like... What is this?
[76:36.43]Kamchotchka.
[76:38.81]Kamchotchka comes with me.
[76:39.88]You got to leave that one.
[76:45.41]You got this, guys.
[76:46.33]All right, that was kind of cringe.
[76:52.35]Stop saying it's cringe.
[76:54.15]It's cringe.
[76:56.57]A lot of people are cringing.
[77:07.89]Wait, I believe for why I'm... Oh!
[77:11.70]Wait, I don't even have an avatar.
[77:13.18]I thought the question mark was like a mechanic.
[77:17.20]I don't even have a guy.
[77:17.96]He gets your cards.
[77:20.94]I'll scan a friend request on my way out.
[77:24.80]Wait, it made me leave the game.
[77:26.19]Wait, it kicked you out of the game?
[77:27.33]I think.
[77:28.87]I think you should be able to spectate, no?
[77:31.29]Unless I probably just clicked the wrong thing.
[77:33.57]I can just stream on Discord if you want.
[77:36.63]You guys ready for this one?
[77:38.91]What's your big plan?
[77:40.05]My big plan is this.
[77:43.33]No, Charlie!
[77:45.31]Jesus Christ.
[77:47.35]I'm sorry, Charlie.
[77:48.39]I have to go this way.
[77:50.03]I was just about to save America.
[77:52.05]You seem really torn up about it, Jeremiah.
[77:53.97]Oh, God.
[77:55.67]Thinks he's some king?
[77:58.61]Even in death, he thinks a soldier's king.
[78:01.23]Oh, petty.
[78:02.39]Petty.
[78:03.17]It is.
[78:04.61]It's very petty, but I don't want you to get a bonus for this.
[78:07.16]Oh, grow up.
[78:08.10]Also, Peru.
[78:08.96]What is that for?
[78:10.24]What are you doing?
[78:11.55]Just to fuck with you.
[78:14.69]Don't regret that.
[78:17.35]Yes.
[78:18.45]Yes.
[78:19.94]We still have a chance.
[78:24.78]I want to make sure I don't do this wrong.
[78:33.33]What if you defend this?
[78:34.15]I'd laugh so hard.
[78:35.39]You might.
[78:36.89]You actually might.
[78:40.24]Come on, boys.
[78:43.96]For lovely Lady Liberty.
[78:45.58]Hey, Letter, can you give me like 500 subs?
[78:52.93]Expand upon that idea.
[78:53.87]It's like a joke.
[78:55.49]No, it doesn't sound great.
[78:56.63]I feel like it's supposed to... After your dad called me cringe too, I feel like no.
[79:00.40]He's like, he doesn't know what Twitch is.
[79:02.04]He doesn't get it.
[79:03.16]Jeremy, you made a big mistake.
[79:04.43]I get to come back.
[79:07.15]Jeremy, you made a big mistake.
[79:09.39]Wait, what?
[79:09.93]What happened?
[79:10.27]What happened?
[79:10.59]What's going on?
[79:11.10]You ran out of time.
[79:12.40]Out of time?
[79:12.92]What do you mean run out of time?
[79:13.92]Where should I go?
[79:14.80]Where should I go?
[79:15.58]Off of the screen.
[79:17.87]Charlie, you should fortify one area as much as possible.
[79:20.71]Yep.
[79:21.45]And it shouldn't be... It should be an area... Leave Western USP.
[79:26.13]I'm going to adopt that, and I'm going to attack his 10 troop.
[79:28.53]You should try to attack his 11 if you can.
[79:30.68]If you can't, escape to South America.
[79:32.48]I will give you refuge there.
[79:33.82]Yeah, I think I'm just going to head to South America.
[79:36.34]Head to South America.
[79:37.78]I will protect you.
[79:38.38]All right.
[79:39.16]Thank you.
[79:39.62]I'm here to come.
[79:41.80]I am flabbergasted.
[79:43.14]Or you can fight 11 and 11.
[79:44.54]I'm flabbergasted right now.
[79:46.14]I don't... Would this help you, Lud, if I did 11 and 11?
[79:49.08]It would help me vanquish the rest of him, yeah.
[79:51.30]Because I'll take the 10 on.
[79:52.27]I can't.
[79:52.77]It's impossible.
[79:54.01]I was winning.
[79:54.67]We stay in sight.
[79:55.39]Alright, I'm not a bitch.
[79:57.33]This is for you, Lud.
[79:58.19]We stay in sight.
[79:58.85]Our alliance.
[79:59.75]Our alliance.
[80:00.15]No!
[80:00.35]Ah!
[80:01.11]Ah!
[80:04.36]Alright, okay.
[80:05.58]Alright.
[80:07.51]It's not that bad.
[80:08.67]It was a good fight.
[80:10.63]This is winnable.
[80:13.23]Yeah, so now you just need to protect Mexico for me.
[80:17.59]Which I will.
[80:18.61]Motherfucker is gonna eat you, Charlie.
[80:20.93]He's gonna get all your cards.
[80:23.28]No, he's gonna go up to the western United States.
[80:27.40]He's gonna strike you from there.
[80:29.44]I can't believe I ran out of time.
[80:33.99]That was some very sad... Okay, how do we do this?
[80:39.85]I think we go here.
[80:44.92]Ooh.
[80:46.38]Why is there a hearthstone timer on risk?
[80:48.76]It takes a minute to figure out where you're going to go, first of all.
[80:51.60]I agree.
[80:52.96]We're getting roped?
[80:54.12]Hearthstone roped in the game?
[80:55.88]Game would have looked a lot different if I had more time.
[80:58.08]Fuck.
[80:59.98]All right.
[81:00.90]Oh, jeez.
[81:02.61]Charlie?
[81:03.90]Just leave me Mexico.
[81:05.22]It's all I need.
[81:06.16]That's such fu- I fucking have that win!
[81:10.34]I win that!
[81:11.42]That's so fucking stupid.
[81:12.96]No longer.
[81:13.90]Charlie, if I let you live, he's gonna kill you and win the game.
[81:17.35]You don't know that.
[81:18.15]You don't know that, Ludd.
[81:19.23]Charlie.
[81:20.77]I don't have any cards, by the way.
[81:22.63]I used them on my last turn.
[81:23.95]I will not kill you.
[81:24.47]You get nothing for this.
[81:25.13]I will not kill you.
[81:28.72]I've been in this spot, Charlie.
[81:31.47]I will do everything.
[81:32.64]You had value.
[81:33.38]I have nothing for you.
[81:34.52]I have nothing for you.
[81:38.10]I will protect you.
[81:39.42]I'm going to come through here.
[81:41.10]I promise I will not consume that one area that you have.
[81:46.45]All I need is Mexico.
[81:48.57]I didn't kill you, Charlie.
[81:50.31]I left you alive, as you can see.
[81:51.63]Thank you.
[81:53.79]Charlie, I'm leaving you alive.
[81:55.39]Oh, thank you.
[81:55.93]We fought so desperately.
[82:00.63]Okay, I have this timer.
[82:07.99]What's your plan, wise guy?
[82:09.35]You are not leaving him alive.
[82:10.70]You're lying!
[82:11.42]Holy shit.
[82:13.06]You lied.
[82:14.00]You're not allowed to lie in war.
[82:17.17]It's one of the war crimes, the major one.
[82:19.39]Yeah, it's a Geneva Convention violation.
[82:22.10]Charlie, he's gonna kill you.
[82:23.04]He's gonna kill you, Charlie.
[82:23.82]No, he's not.
[82:24.22]He wouldn't.
[82:25.22]No, he's beelining towards you with six bullets.
[82:27.32]But he's gonna stop.
[82:28.34]It's like when Godzilla was destroying the city, but then they all held hands, and he's like, all right, I'm done here.
[82:40.92]Wait.
[82:41.96]No, you're not thinking about going.
[82:49.43]man of my word oh my god thank you we in new mexico in mexico thank you might as well be new mexico at this point it's been shifted around so much
[83:06.11]All right, so I just want to make sure we're aware that I left you alive.
[83:10.73]I could have taken your cards.
[83:12.23]That's right.
[83:12.63]That's right.
[83:13.79]I won't forget that.
[83:14.47]Well, let's not forget about who left you alive in the first place.
[83:17.35]I border surrounding you.
[83:18.81]We've had an alliance for years now.
[83:20.47]I know.
[83:20.85]We've been tight for a long time.
[83:24.10]He was whining about that, though.
[83:25.26]He was like, oh, but Charlie, I don't know.
[83:27.14]He's going to go up there next turn.
[83:29.04]That was what he said.
[83:29.98]Remember that?
[83:30.77]I do remember that.
[83:32.20]We're just happy existing out here, honestly.
[83:34.24]We're just happy to be here.
[83:36.30]By the way, if you attack Charlie here, Ludwig, that's a declaration of war across everywhere else for me.
[83:44.96]Is that right?
[83:59.95]We'd be the only two remaining.
[84:00.97]Of course, we'd be declaring war on each other.
[84:05.70]Ludwig, you play this game like a nerd.
[84:10.28]You just gotta put everybody in one spot.
[84:12.04]I don't think that's what you got in you, necessarily.
[84:15.38]How cool guys play it.
[84:17.69]Are you cool guys?
[84:18.39]Yeah.
[84:18.87]Yeah, that's fair.
[84:23.35]Yeah, thanks for completing the gift counter five-step challenge, trooper.
[84:51.35]Really?
[84:54.03]No?
[84:54.59]Okay.
[84:59.87]Whoa.
[85:00.77]Holy shit.
[85:02.07]Wait, how did they move that way?
[85:03.99]They can go across any territories that connect.
[85:06.45]And so they went all the way across through Madagascar or New Zealand.
[85:15.00]So, but I couldn't move people on a boat from the north of Asia to Mexico.
[85:19.52]Okay, sure.
[85:20.44]That's fine.
[85:23.58]No, you're not!
[85:25.66]German, you wouldn't.
[85:28.25]I'm thinking.
[85:29.97]You're thinking about killing a Mexican army.
[85:32.39]No, he's not.
[85:33.43]That's not going across his mind.
[85:34.75]He's looking at going for you.
[85:38.27]Going through Hawaii.
[85:39.11]I'm just concerned.
[85:39.71]I don't think he's thinking about 6-6 in Hawaii.
[85:42.17]I don't think he's thinking about that.
[85:43.27]Well, I'm concerned about Hawaii, because you can just walk right in.
[85:47.83]Exactly.
[85:48.41]Hawaii is a big threat.
[85:50.75]Hawaii is pretty threatening.
[85:53.21]Wait, why are you?
[85:54.35]Motherfucker, you gotta be kidding me.
[85:57.93]Are you guys kidding me?
[85:59.21]I lost seven troops and you lost two.
[86:01.67]Oh no.
[86:03.13]Unbelievable.
[86:07.07]Don't worry, we in Mexico won't forget that.
[86:10.19]Charlie, what I want you to do is I want you to attack me so you get a card.
[86:15.62]So then you might get a turn in the next round.
[86:17.32]And then you might be able to clean this up because he's going to kill me next turn, I think.
[86:20.76]Okay, all right.
[86:21.53]Come up through North America.
[86:23.37]All right, I'll swing through.
[86:29.07]What are you doing?
[86:29.99]No, no, no.
[86:30.83]I don't want to do that.
[86:33.51]Oh my god, that was scary.
[86:35.41]Oh my god.
[86:36.27]Mexico is on high alert right there.
[86:37.97]People of Mexico are freaking out for a second.
[86:40.33]Alright, I'm coming.
[86:42.13]What do you need me to take from you?
[86:43.75]The western United States?
[86:45.93]Whatever you can get here to be able to fortify because he's going to come for both of us right now.
[86:49.62]I'm not coming for Charlie.
[86:50.84]He's making it in us against... I'm not against you, Charlie.
[86:53.82]I've done nothing to protect you since day one.
[86:57.08]So what do I need to get a card?
[86:58.68]You need to get one area.
[87:00.32]It doesn't matter what area, any area at all.
[87:02.39]Winning it gives you a card.
[87:03.49]Okay, I'm just going to take this one for the card then.
[87:06.01]And I'm going to bring all of my boys back to Mexico.
[87:11.71]I can't do that, I see.
[87:12.91]Okay.
[87:13.59]No, you can if you end the attack and then you do fortify, I think, right?
[87:17.55]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[87:19.83]Nice.
[87:20.85]Big strat, big strat.
[87:24.44]Then you got an opportunity after this turn.
[87:26.36]Ludwig has cheat engine on.
[87:28.16]I'm watching his screen.
[87:29.02]He's like seeing different numbers.
[87:32.01]It's the overlay gunner.
[87:33.15]Show your task manager right now.
[87:37.83]36.
[87:39.67]Oh boy.
[87:40.11]This is bad.
[87:40.57]How do I do this?
[87:43.56]The Congo will hold strong.
[87:45.22]It's got Asia.
[87:50.26]Asia is what?
[87:50.78]8?
[87:51.04]11 should do.
[87:56.96]Guys, we can't let Ludwig win.
[87:58.30]He's, like, not cool, guys.
[88:02.51]Mexico will be the last place standing, mark my words.
[88:05.99]That's my dream.
[88:07.65]My dream is that I don't get all the areas.
[88:09.39]I get all of them except for Mexico.
[88:12.36]A perfect world.
[88:13.60]And then you have a card turn in, and you just wipe out everything, Charlie.
[88:18.46]I did get a card out of that.
[88:20.38]I wonder if you have it.
[88:34.93]Ludwig, are you trying to kill me this turn?
[88:38.27]What?
[88:40.37]No.
[88:41.11]South Africa, hold.
[88:43.96]I think you're going to kill me this turn.
[88:47.04]Sure, Ma.
[88:48.02]He's going to be okay.
[88:49.72]You got that five down south that it's a little too strong at the moment.
[88:54.34]But your time will come.
[88:55.80]Wipe me out.
[88:56.18]Leave me that one.
[89:00.59]Yeah, leave me the one.
[89:03.17]You have a few here.
[89:11.80]Wow.
[89:12.02]Leto gave a bunch of ones on the map.
[89:13.72]Looks really stupid.
[89:24.84]That was... That was noble.
[89:31.46]I'm going to try to block him from coming this way.
[89:38.54]Do you have a turn in?
[89:40.89]I missed it by one, but we have heart.
[89:43.73]We have heart here.
[89:45.79]Okay, if you can kill me, you probably should because you'll get my cards.
[89:51.07]He can take South America.
[89:54.13]Oh my god, you can.
[89:55.25]I can take South America.
[89:58.51]And it's the only thing I can do here.
[90:02.77]Oh my god.
[90:04.47]I'm abandoning Mexico.
[90:05.97]I'm coming.
[90:07.57]He's in the back before, Charlie.
[90:09.03]No, I can't.
[90:10.47]I can't.
[90:11.45]Charlie, you deck me here and it's done.
[90:13.23]But you're going to kill me anyway, Lud.
[90:15.86]You don't care about Mexico.
[90:17.06]I know it's Mexico.
[90:19.46]But if you come for me, I'm coming for you.
[90:21.42]I have no choice.
[90:23.42]I'm coming.
[90:23.76]I'm fleeing.
[90:26.76]It's not just gonna be the Mexicans.
[90:28.74]There it is.
[90:29.68]It'll be the Western Californians.
[90:32.28]The Nova Scotians.
[90:34.88]I'm getting the fuck out.
[90:35.94]I'm gonna get everyone, Charlie!
[90:38.70]That's okay.
[90:39.24]That's okay.
[90:39.56]Argentina's back under freedom rule.
[90:40.74]I'm the psycho though, right?
[90:42.22]From the beginning.
[90:42.84]Remember I was the one?
[90:44.84]No!
[90:45.26]Oh, it's a shame.
[90:47.24]No!
[90:56.63]Oh my god.
[90:58.68]I drew Exodia.
[90:59.80]30 of them.
[91:04.62]I'm telling you, I'm gonna be the last guy here over in Canada with a stick in my hand.
[91:11.16]Mexico won't fall.
[91:14.16]Let's find out.
[91:18.64]Oh no.
[91:22.10]No one's even like trying to fight.
[91:24.74]Just wait.
[91:25.18]Watch Mexico.
[91:25.85]It's going to go from 18 to 10.
[91:26.85]This is going to be such a noble battle.
[91:31.57]Let's go, Mexico!
[91:32.79]There it is.
[91:36.87]Hey, they got their one.
[91:37.89]They did their part.
[91:38.91]They did.
[91:39.65]It's been a pleasure, Charlie.
[91:41.43]We don't know it's over yet.
[91:43.58]Oh, the Western Knight.
[91:45.02]No!
[91:51.94]It's bad.
[91:52.32]It's got so many cards.
[91:53.50]Yeah, this is bad.
[91:58.86]Oh, please.
[91:59.36]Oh, that's cringe.
[92:03.73]Oh, what the fuck?
[92:04.41]It just sent me back to the main menu.
[92:06.89]Yeah, that happened to me too.
[92:07.91]A little bit of streaming and a discord.
[92:10.29]Oh, is he?
[92:10.75]Okay.
[92:16.30]I can just pull up his stream.
[92:17.86]I won't be able to put this on screen.
[92:23.44]Oh, you want to do it?
[92:24.14]You're going to leave that?
[92:26.91]You're going to leave Canada there?
[92:29.22]That's cringe, Ludwig.
[92:33.55]Give you one turn.
[92:34.21]Alright.
[92:38.97]Like the four of us are just gonna run at you with like pots and pans and sticks and shit and rocks.
[92:44.98]Here we go.
[92:48.36]Like a bunch of polar bears.
[92:50.62]Let's go!
[92:54.42]Ow!
[92:56.60]Well, we got nowhere to go.
[92:58.82]GG.
[92:59.76]GG.
[93:00.38]People saying this is so humiliating.
[93:09.30]No, it's not.
[93:12.00]This is exactly why I invited all three of them to play.
[93:16.22]Process the results.
[93:21.31]I needed that!
[93:26.66]Yeah, the running out of time was it, right?
[93:30.98]You definitely win if you don't.
[93:33.35]I don't know if I would have won.
[93:34.85]If you betray Charlie and kill him, you win for sure.
[93:38.05]I was hoping.
[93:38.85]You don't really win with that.
[93:44.79]Your friend invites everybody to play their favorite game and he just kicks everybody's ass.
[93:48.56]And then everybody's like, we're around, but he's having a great time.
[93:53.86]We're just happy to be here.
[93:55.81]yeah yeah that's kind of what I'm going for uh do you do you guys want to do another one that's just the us I'm down yes just the u.s it's just the u.s it breaks it up by states though oh okay uh and I'll increase our turn timer is actually 90 seconds to 120. do you want to try manual placement
[94:19.45]Yeah, let's do it for the United States one.
[94:21.23]That shouldn't be that long.
[94:25.38]Is progressive card bonus better?
[94:26.68]You were mentioning that that is what you usually play.
[94:29.22]Games end a lot quicker because it goes from like 3 to like 6 all the way up to 30, I think.
[94:36.17]Are you making a new game?
[94:38.05]Yeah, yeah.
[94:39.25]Should I do Fog of War?
[94:40.91]It seems kind of interesting.
[94:42.94]Oh, that worked.
[94:43.42]It limits visibility of territories to only the ones around you, so you don't know who owns what else.
[94:48.84]That sounds awesome.
[94:51.16]I will do progressive, fog of war on, and manual placement.
[94:53.94]We're going to get crazy here.
[94:54.86]Oh, I got to fix my steam real quick.
[95:00.04]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[95:00.62]Please do.
[95:01.65]Please make sure that shit works.
[95:03.35]I'm going to put the code in our group chat.
[95:06.09]Very good.
[95:11.41]I got to spend five tokens to join.
[95:14.51]Jerm, you don't really read your chat and listen to them a lot, right?
[95:17.59]It depends.
[95:18.57]Actually, I do sometimes.
[95:20.05]Why?
[95:20.55]Oh, okay.
[95:21.23]Well, I just open it up and I see people saying like, oh, I instantly killed Ludwig.
[95:24.96]You know, but like... Passes in the past.
[95:28.00]A lot of people are saying that.
[95:29.76]It's a new game.
[95:31.18]Yeah.
[95:33.67]Guys, let's keep the Ludwig hate to a minimum, guys.
[95:35.53]He's a cool guy.
[95:36.33]Guys.
[95:38.63]You farming bat chests or actual sympathy here?
[95:40.89]He's a cool guy.
[95:43.11]No.
[95:43.61]Guys, stop saying that about Ludwig.
[95:45.69]I love Ludwig.
[95:46.33]Stop saying that.
[95:47.67]Stop.
[95:49.17]I can't repeat that.
[95:51.81]I didn't leak the code stuff.
[95:59.86]I heckin' love Ludwig.
[96:04.59]I can hear the bad chest.
[96:05.81]I don't even need to... You don't got to say it at that point.
[96:08.45]Ludwig, can you do the gift Connor 500 subs challenge?
[96:15.00]I don't... It's like a trend.
[96:16.82]I guess I don't know how it works.
[96:18.74]Like a trend.
[96:19.34]A lot of people are doing it.
[96:21.09]Who are, like, some other people, like, just for influence?
[96:23.34]Like, uh... Um, like, MrBeast.
[96:28.36]I did it.
[96:29.64]You, like, MrBeast.
[96:30.40]Jerma did it.
[96:31.04]Jerma did it.
[96:31.46]MrBeast did it, and you talked MrBeast.
[96:32.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[96:33.34]I'm sorry.
[96:33.68]Let's not... Tycuno did it.
[96:35.24]Jerma, you did this?
[96:36.36]I did it already, yeah.
[96:37.22]You did it.
[96:37.94]How does the challenge work?
[96:40.78]You just gift Connor 500 subs to Conrad's fans.
[96:43.56]That's it.
[96:45.52]You can also, like, do, like, the gift Connor 5 subs challenge, like, if you, like, don't have that much money.
[96:51.05]You just like be a part of something.
[96:54.33]You know what?
[96:55.13]Sign me up.
[96:57.65]Gift Connor.
[96:59.90]Five.
[97:00.58]I mean, if like, it depends on like your yearly like net income though.
[97:04.64]Like if you like, you gave one sub.
[97:07.92]Challenge accepted, Connor.
[97:09.24]Did you see it?
[97:09.88]One sub is not a challenge.
[97:11.11]Five dollars.
[97:13.93]So.
[97:16.23]Give Connor five dollars challenge.
[97:17.85]Everybody's saying Ludwig's cringe.
[97:19.45]Okay, that doesn't feel nice after you usually say, hey, thanks for the gifted sub, Ludwig.
[97:23.24]I really appreciate it.
[97:24.70]I owe my chat like 150 community subs.
[97:28.34]All my cards, all my PayPal, everything gets declined from Twitch now.
[97:31.42]I don't know why.
[97:32.56]Yeah, it does happen to me a lot.
[97:34.24]Grumpy Grim did the five sub challenge.
[97:36.19]Wow, Grumpy Grim is more money than you, Ludwig.
[97:38.17]I had to get a new credit card just to do that.
[97:39.63]Are you serious?
[97:41.37]Yeah, because it kept getting declined.
[97:44.54]And so I have like, I got a, there's a specific, uh, it's actually kind of insane, but there's a specific bank that gives you a credit limit based off your followers.
[97:53.22]Very dystopian.
[97:55.91]Oh yeah.
[97:56.73]Yeah.
[97:57.37]That's my bank.
[97:59.43]Give me the biggest.
[98:00.33]Yeah.
[98:02.01]Cause I had a thousand dollar credit limit before them.
[98:07.03]Wait, hold on.
[98:08.13]Does that mean that you have like, uh,
[98:12.39]How many millions of followers do you have?
[98:16.13]Well, it depends.
[98:18.93]Like one on Twitter, a couple on YouTube.
[98:21.75]It's not like a dollar a follower.
[98:24.96]Oh, shit.
[98:25.50]I was going to say, what?
[98:27.22]No, it's just the credit limit is based off those numbers.
[98:31.50]They have some algorithm.
[98:32.92]Oh.
[98:34.36]So they increase it if you have a more substantial following.
[98:39.27]Really?
[98:39.55]Mm-hmm.
[98:40.97]Yeah.
[98:41.52]yeah they did that for me and like they gave me like a credit limit way over like anything that I'd ever need like it was just ridiculous and then I definitely don't get anywhere near that so now they text me like weekly they're like we're bumping up your limit today like go for it have at it maybe have some fun and I I don't ever do it what is your charlie I'm gonna stop streaming maybe that'll help too
[99:04.44]This happened with Elden Ring, too.
[99:05.98]I don't know what's going on.
[99:09.52]It's just Steam games are flickering?
[99:12.31]Yeah, that's an understatement.
[99:13.93]It's a full strobe.
[99:15.79]You can't see it on stream.
[99:17.21]It's just on my monitor.
[99:20.97]Is it just the game, or could you play through OBS?
[99:26.23]Yeah, like I could play through the OBS, but it's, yeah, just the game.
[99:30.46]I guess you can't play through OBS because you have to click on the game.
[99:32.72]I didn't think about that.
[99:34.22]Oh, true.
[99:34.66]You guys like Elden Ring PvP stuff?
[99:41.71]Oh, yeah, you messaged me about that, Jerem.
[99:43.05]I still have to set that up.
[99:44.25]Yeah, because I have confirmed I think it could work.
[99:49.28]I think Elden Ring PvP always looks great.
[99:51.81]You know who really wanted to do that, actually?
[99:53.19]It was Sykkuno.
[99:55.67]Really?
[99:55.89]Yeah, really wanted to do it.
[99:57.69]Because they did something somewhat similar to you.
[100:01.09]Do you know the streamer Mii Young?
[100:03.03]Yeah.
[100:03.84]She played Elden Ring like you play Pokemon, where she would throw out her Pokemon, Sykkuno and Toast, and they would fight the boss and she would run away.
[100:12.50]Yeah, that's, like, exactly the kind of thing that I want to do.
[100:15.62]I want to do a night where we get, like, a bunch of streamers that pick, like, champions from their community.
[100:21.91]And we throw them out where they have to fight in, like, a PvP setting.
[100:26.17]And we get, like, up to maybe, like, three to five, like, champions from the community.
[100:29.53]Uh-huh.
[100:30.89]And we are essentially, like, trial by combating each other.
[100:34.25]Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[100:35.03]I like that idea.
[100:36.26]That's cool.
[100:38.12]I think the only thing that's...
[100:41.23]I guess, no, it should be easy enough.
[100:42.29]I was going to say, like, making sure you summon the right person, but you can just read the name and confirm it.
[100:47.42]You have to confirm it beforehand, right?
[100:49.44]Where it gets weird is, so you can summon two gold cooperators and one invader.
[100:57.47]So if we had more than four or five streamers, they'd have to be multiple games going on.
[101:04.09]Because if only four people can be in a game, the two people that are going against each other, so like two streamers, one streamer would summon as a gold sign the other streamer, and then summon that streamer's person as another gold sign, and then they would have to summon an invader that was on their team.
[101:23.89]It's very, very confusing, but I think it would work.
[101:27.19]Yeah.
[101:28.27]It sounds harder to do with many people.
[101:32.98]Like if you had a group of eight doing it or something.
[101:34.66]Yeah.
[101:36.28]Because only two streamers could get their fighters in at once.
[101:39.10]I feel like the setup will be the most... Maybe it's possible.
[101:42.22]Or one gold, two red.
[101:44.20]The setup would be a little weird, but it would theoretically function correctly.
[101:52.60]But I've got at least two or three people in mind that I know would be great competitors.
[101:57.46]You have like warriors already?
[101:58.86]Oh, yeah.
[101:59.91]I'll have to run my own event to get my own warriors.
[102:03.25]Yeah, I was going to say, whoever wanted to do it, you'd have to have at least, you know, try to get whatever the number would decide, like three to five champions.
[102:12.32]So they'd probably have to be people that, because I don't know, where do you draw the line of, oh, I'm going to get like an Elden Ring PvP guy to come in and just wipe the floor with everybody.
[102:24.85]I think everyone should understand and keep it fun, you know?
[102:27.47]Yeah.
[102:29.57]barf drinker absolutely is one of them I gotta try I've honestly after that stream ended I was like hey do we know who that is because like I really like want them on my team connor you think you can do this challenge could you eat this in 90 minutes for 3500 challenge destroyed
[102:52.43]What does that look like?
[102:53.05]A couple large fries, four Big Macs.
[102:56.36]Was that 20 nuggets?
[102:56.96]40 nuggets, I think.
[102:57.96]40 nuggets and four Cokes.
[103:01.88]Yeah, three medium cokes and a large coke.
[103:03.32]90 minutes?
[103:03.94]Probably not, honestly.
[103:05.06]I don't think I can do that.
[103:06.08]Yeah, we're trying to track down the real Barf Drinker.
[103:09.92]It's gonna be like, alright, it's gonna be hard.
[103:11.66]Because now, now, like somebody just said, a thousand of you just went to Ranala and changed your name to Barf Drinker.
[103:21.85]So, we'll figure it out.
[103:23.83]If we do it, it's just a fun idea.
[103:25.69]We'll see.
[103:27.23]and how I never spend near the limit.
[103:29.57]My last text to them was beginning of the year.
[103:31.71]They said, we're starting off the year with a challenge.
[103:34.71]They said, spend 5K by next weekend to unlock a surprise.
[103:38.79]And I never responded.
[103:41.09]What is your credit limit with them?
[103:44.14]Say again?
[103:45.32]Is your credit limit high with them, like much higher than the other stuff?
[103:48.00]Yeah.
[103:49.46]My credit limit, I have two credit cards.
[103:51.22]For my credit card, it's $1,000.
[103:55.17]And for this credit card, it's $100,000.
[103:56.23]Give me one second.
[103:57.42]I'll be right back.
[104:00.58]This is really tough.
[104:01.76]You're good, big man.
[104:02.66]All right.
[104:03.62]Give me one second.
[104:04.28]Yeah.
[104:05.28]Yeah, that's with the social follower credit limit bank.
[104:10.26]I would be kind of scared of that in a way.
[104:14.22]$100,000?
[104:14.74]To fear.
[104:17.16]If you need to purchase like a $20,000 statue of like Jackie Chan, perhaps.
[104:21.33]That's true.
[104:22.41]Just put it on the card.
[104:28.07]That's crazy.
[104:29.37]But I can only use it for business stuff.
[104:30.93]I can't like... Oh, yeah.
[104:34.71]Taking my card of... Trader Joe's.
[104:40.21]$100,000 credit limited Trader Joe's.
[104:41.77]Like, yeah, I guess I'll take... I guess I'll take every tiki masala you have in the store.
[104:47.44]It's like a Mr. Beast title.
[104:52.34]That is kind of like a Mr. Beast title.
[104:54.48]How long do you think you could go without eating food, Jerma?
[104:57.92]um until I die or no no honest like like without dying like like right now if it was like a challenge you had to go as long as you possibly could before you cracked how long do you think that would go I could probably 24 hours
[105:17.02]And then you crack?
[105:18.18]I'd crack after a day.
[105:19.20]I'd crack at, like, probably 22 to 24 hours.
[105:21.64]I think so.
[105:23.56]Ludwig, I'm telling you, my hunger strike-a-thon is going to break the internet, man.
[105:27.09]People are going to be tuning in from all over.
[105:29.53]I'm going to be like, I need to get Connor 1,000 subs so he eats.
[105:33.47]And then, like, I'd do it.
[105:35.07]I think it's a bad idea.
[105:36.81]People would be like, this guy's got to eat food.
[105:38.63]And they'd be subbing.
[105:39.89]But don't you think people might say, Connor, you are exploiting your viewers by threatening to go starve yourself to death.
[105:48.68]That's why they're giving it.
[105:49.74]I'm not threatening it.
[105:50.46]It's not a threat.
[105:50.98]It's going to happen.
[105:51.52]It's a plot.
[105:52.66]Okay.
[105:54.04]If I don't get the sub goal, I'm just not going to eat.
[105:56.90]That's worse.
[105:57.96]I would say that's worse.
[105:59.10]I can't get his head stuck in the french fry box.
[106:02.65]If I don't get these subs, I'm just not going to eat.
[106:07.19]Wait, get off.
[106:07.81]That's worse.
[106:11.03]Okay, sorry.
[106:11.63]Yeah, no, I'm not gonna eat food unless I get the sub goal How many people are just gonna go to that till they can just be like I'm just kind of out of here Well, the hope is that you know people would show up and be like on the same team as me If they band together and don't pay, would you really not eat for days?
[106:33.51]Hold on, I don't need to just see Bumper with the... I could not go more than one.
[106:37.74]12 hours would be hard.
[106:38.56]More than 24 hours would be impossible, I think.
[106:41.54]This is a great picture of Bumper, by the way.
[106:42.94]He was, like, jumping around the table trying to get this thing off.
[106:48.87]Would you cat get into the french fries?
[106:50.83]Yeah.
[106:51.25]He got his head stuck in...
[106:54.92]Jerm, I mention it because Mr. Beast called me today and he wants to do a video where he doesn't eat for an extended period, but like a month's worth of time.
[107:02.46]A month in a row of not eating.
[107:04.66]Yeah, yeah.
[107:05.73]I think you die in seven days.
[107:07.53]Like, don't you die in like four days?
[107:10.63]I think I thought you could go like a month.
[107:12.49]Yeah, I thought it was like three days for water.
[107:14.07]Don't do it again, bumper.
[107:16.30]30 for food.
[107:16.84]That's water.
[107:17.40]Okay, yeah, water is seven days.
[107:19.88]But I think it's like, also, you probably need a bit of training for 30 days.
[107:23.30]Like, I don't think you... What about, like, vitamins or nutrients?
[107:26.68]Any nutrients at all?
[107:27.80]I imagine it's no calories, but probably, like, you know, a Flintstones gummy vitamin.
[107:35.04]I don't know.
[107:35.62]I wouldn't know if I would do that.
[107:37.00]If you guys want to find out how long it can go, tune into the Hunger Strike-a-thon after, like, a month when the sub goal gets to, like, 10K for, like, food and eating.
[107:45.20]It's based on your body fat.
[107:48.97]Oh, yeah.
[107:49.47]That's what Charlie was saying.
[107:51.31]You'd probably feel awful after... I don't know.
[107:55.23]I can't even imagine doing that for more than even a couple of days.
[107:58.59]I don't know.
[107:58.99]I feel like they're terrible.
[108:01.64]Yeah, he wanted to do it with people, so he asked me, but I don't think I'd make it more than a week.
[108:07.36]But I think, like, a week I could do.
[108:11.82]What about, like, organ damage?
[108:15.27]Oh, yeah.
[108:15.79]No, that's part of it, I think.
[108:19.55]Although my aunt did this where she didn't eat for, I think it was like three days.
[108:23.84]She fasted, which I don't think is that uncommon.
[108:26.98]And it's cool because it resets your palate and then you get a baby's palate.
[108:31.36]She hated coffee and alcohol and smoking, even though she did all those before.
[108:37.38]And she just liked what she did as a kid.
[108:42.77]Like, fasting is, you know, it's something people do, but, like, a month straight of not eating anything?
[108:49.93]A full month?
[108:53.15]Yeah.
[108:55.51]Three to seven days, I think, isn't that rare in the fasting world, right?
[109:01.41]I know absolutely nothing about fasting.
[109:03.33]I just know that you cannot survive more than a month without food.
[109:13.26]My mom used to do 48 hours every year or so.
[109:18.62]What point does... I don't even... I'm trying to even think what would even happen after like three weeks straight.
[109:24.11]You would have to have some form of nutrients.
[109:25.45]You have to.
[109:26.95]Yeah, I think you have to have like... But maybe you do... You know what?
[109:31.05]I don't know if it's... Those IV fluid drips.
[109:36.28]But no eating?
[109:36.68]You're just going to do like an IV bag every few days?
[109:39.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[109:42.17]Like the ones influencers use after crazy parties.
[109:44.99]At what point is it just sad?
[109:46.17]You're just watching Mr. Beast like in pain.
[109:48.83]He's like, oh, guys, I got the IV today.
[109:50.89]Yeah, I think I think what they keep it light by having Carl Jacobs come in with a big old like McDonald's order.
[109:59.21]Then he eats in front of him and then they go, oh, Carl.
[110:04.15]Oh, Carl.
[110:04.97]Thanks.
[110:06.09]I don't know about all that.
[110:07.07]I don't know if I would not be able to do that.
[110:10.83]I was like, even just like doing the IV bag for nutrients thing, I kind of would rather just eat like a banana.
[110:17.92]Well, yeah, obviously, yeah.
[110:21.94]Like, oh, yeah, here, we're going to do like just like a vitamin and nutrient IV.
[110:26.67]Can I just have like a coconut water instead?
[110:28.61]Like, I think that's, I would rather have that.
[110:31.11]Could I just have food with nutrition?
[110:35.81]Boys, I don't want to hold you up any longer.
[110:37.55]You can just play without me.
[110:38.62]I cannot fix this.
[110:39.80]I've tried literally fucking everything.
[110:41.66]It is just not working.
[110:44.98]Alright, you want to try restarting or you just want to call it?
[110:49.14]Uh, I can try restart.
[110:51.44]I don't see why that would fix it, but I can give it a try.
[110:54.68]Yeah, we're cool.
[110:55.54]We can turn it on again.
[110:56.94]We can chill for a little bit.
[110:57.98]It's all good.
[110:58.30]Run it.
[110:59.04]I linked you guys a type racer if you guys want to get a little crazy here.
[111:02.54]I'm not very good at this.
[111:04.30]Charlie, you could also just play through OBS for now.
[111:08.21]Well, I'd still need to click into the game.
[111:10.61]Uh, that's true.
[111:14.15]Uh, well, we can try that.
[111:16.97]I can try just playing through OBS.
[111:19.47]Let me try one last thing with the refresh rate, even though I know that won't fix it.
[111:24.38]The dude that just keeps spamming.
[111:30.06]This guy in my chat says he fasts two weeks every three months.
[111:34.00]And you have to drink water, take vitamins, and have salt.
[111:37.60]And it only works if you have stored fat.
[111:43.11]I got enough medical problems, man.
[111:44.61]I don't think I'd want to, like, cause another one somehow.
[111:47.89]Yeah, no, that's fair.
[111:50.27]Who am I in with?
[111:50.97]Is this Connor?
[111:51.61]It's me, yeah.
[111:52.93]Alright, Connor, you quick?
[111:55.01]Yeah, well, I don't know, actually.
[112:00.20]No, I'm not quick.
[112:06.74]Yeah, that's also... I would also want to be careful of, like...
[112:13.29]We would need doctors and like medical staff kind of nutritionists be able to like kind of really really advising that.
[112:22.91]Like I would be scared to do that personally.
[112:33.01]You need professionals?
[112:35.77]No doctor would say to do that.
[112:40.73]I love the background menu music, yeah.
[112:47.20]Yeah, I've never fasted or anything.
[112:49.36]Well, okay, that's not necessarily true.
[112:53.38]I have done a small fast because I was trying to see.
[112:59.24]And by small, I mean like not even a full day, like one day.
[113:03.69]Because back when I was having all the medical problems in like my chest and back and shit It was like I'm gonna just eliminate literally everything and just drink fucking water and see what happens And I started to slowly introduce foods and stuff To see if it was something I was eating something that was causing a problem like that, right?
[113:24.22]But never I never did it for any other reason That was literally like not even 24 hours
[113:32.39]It was like to start an elimination diet, essentially, to slowly put in foods and spices and... Is it a food additive?
[113:39.59]Is it like gluten?
[113:41.03]I was trying to figure that out.
[113:44.91]No, that was not Gandhi.
[113:47.13]Alright, I'm fucking back.
[113:49.31]You good to go?
[113:49.63]I'm ready.
[113:51.11]Loot it up!
[113:51.75]Alright, so this is America.
[113:53.43]This is going to start out a little differently because we're going to be placing our troops.
[113:57.99]So, just try to make it pretty speedy here because this can take a long time if not.
[114:03.24]But when it's your turn, you can just place one troop.
[114:05.42]I'm ready.
[114:05.72]Okay, okay.
[114:08.60]So, what's the card thing that's different?
[114:11.06]It's progressive.
[114:12.12]I don't know, Jeremiah.
[114:12.84]Do you know?
[114:13.30]You might be able to explain it better.
[114:14.56]So if you turn your cards in, it's the first person to turn it in gets the worst one because it's only going to be like three troops.
[114:22.93]Oh, so it always gets higher.
[114:24.33]Every time somebody turns it in, it goes a little bit higher.
[114:29.05]Okay.
[114:29.85]I will claim Ohio.
[114:33.08]I'll take Florida.
[114:33.96]Okay.
[114:36.04]Okay.
[114:38.00]I was going to take Georgia, but if Charlie's going to take Florida, I'll take Texas.
[114:46.34]Oh, it's fog of war, so I can't see.
[114:48.04]We shouldn't be saying this out loud.
[114:49.18]I forgot about this.
[114:50.12]Oh, you can't see.
[114:52.06]That was the whole point of fog of war.
[114:54.15]I'm just going to use this as like a places that I always want to like have wanted to travel to.
[115:00.91]That sounds fun.
[115:02.09]So we place 30, so we have to do 30 of these turns, right?
[115:05.43]yes well uh are there only 30 states no there should be all 50 here no no but we have 30 troops I think you're gonna fortify after we pick enough yeah yeah so you don't stack them I believe he goes out to pick new territories oh has nobody clicked that
[115:34.89]That's weird.
[115:36.61]I'm closing my eyes and just picking territories at random.
[115:40.81]I'm insulted that they've, like, combined some states.
[115:56.28]Oh, interesting.
[115:56.98]I can't even see who got the territory.
[115:59.13]Oh, it's a secret.
[116:01.17]It is a secret.
[116:04.82]Secret secrets are no fun.
[116:11.79]The Hampshire's not too small.
[116:12.75]It's an important state.
[116:16.85]Oh.
[116:22.27]I have a plan.
[116:22.79]Don't worry.
[116:23.15]People don't know that this is a plan.
[116:27.80]There is a plan.
[116:53.76]Oh, quick turns.
[116:54.66]Hi.
[116:56.24]How does this work?
[116:58.69]Because I feel like there's no way that some of you have not clicked on this.
[117:07.89]I'm curious what you're referencing.
[117:11.36]We'll see soon.
[117:11.94]We'll see soon.
[117:21.20]I feel like if there's a question mark when I clicked, then it's probably like someone took it, right?
[117:26.07]Yeah, I'm just shocked that... This is shocking.
[117:40.80]What version of the US map is this?
[117:44.04]You should be able to see the black outlines, and those are the territories in this one.
[117:49.08]um yeah what's going on over here in uh on the this big like hole I I think it's just like the rocky mountains is that just that's just the mountains I think they did it so like um colorado wouldn't be in such a shit spot because it'd be connected by like seven states or something oh okay they marked up like the whole spot where the unabomber was hiding too yeah don't go there
[118:38.44]Uh, that works for me.
[118:41.62]I'm gonna have a shit state at the end.
[118:58.37]Alright, alright.
[119:01.51]This is where I think we fortify.
[119:03.92]It is fortify phase, yeah.
[119:20.48]I feel like this is going to be very, very hard for whoever decided to go in the middle.
[119:30.50]No, why would that be?
[119:33.36]You're surrounded at all times.
[119:35.82]Is this me?
[119:36.54]A very good spot, I think.
[119:38.08]This is red.
[119:40.40]You have 19 troops you have to place.
[119:41.64]Is it making you do all of them at once?
[119:45.40]Charlie, are you placing things right now?
[119:46.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:47.40]I'm placing, I'm placing.
[119:48.26]Okay, okay.
[119:48.72]It's making you do all of them?
[119:49.92]yeah oh oh we go in order oh my god just you right now I think you have to do all of them okay this is I'm just gonna presidential race okay there you go sorry they can take everything that's not this feels like he was saying the south there
[120:17.10]Electoral map.
[120:18.90]We'll see who becomes president.
[120:26.59]Oh.
[120:28.05]It's all Jeb.
[120:31.93]I see.
[120:39.38]Somebody said DOS died for this?
[120:40.76]DOS did not die for this, because after this, we're playing DOS.
[120:43.80]I'm doing it tonight.
[120:46.16]All right.
[121:03.01]all right oh my jeez he hates europe dude in like two or three hours it's gonna be eu stream anyways
[121:30.31]Okay.
[121:30.91]All right.
[121:31.41]Now we see a bit of the map here.
[121:33.47]Why?
[121:33.73]Why do we see so much of the map?
[121:34.59]What do you mean?
[121:36.95]It started.
[121:38.08]How come some of these are fog of ward, though?
[121:40.42]You can only see adjacent areas.
[121:42.94]Oh, okay.
[121:43.36]I get it.
[121:43.66]I get it.
[121:44.70]Yeah.
[121:49.04]Okay.
[121:49.68]Whoa.
[121:50.25]Whoa.
[121:50.57]Chill, man.
[121:54.85]I mean, it's obvious what I have to do here.
[121:57.15]Let's chill out, man.
[121:58.03]Let's not go anywhere.
[121:59.17]Jeremy, you're green?
[122:00.47]Yeah.
[122:00.59]I don't think there are any alliances here.
[122:01.95]I think this is the only one.
[122:03.17]We got one place.
[122:03.99]It's a fresh game.
[122:05.57]It's a brand new game.
[122:06.52]This is a new day.
[122:07.18]New day, new dawn, new battles.
[122:12.45]Who's red?
[122:13.21]Oh, you're going to regret that.
[122:15.23]I like listening because I can't see anything.
[122:20.95]It's actually way worse as a stream experience, but funnier.
[122:23.81]Oh, you guys can't see anything?
[122:25.75]You're going to regret that.
[122:27.37]Jesus Christ.
[122:28.79]I have not seen a thing happen.
[122:31.79]I was adjacent to it, so I could see it.
[122:36.59]Don't do it.
[122:40.62]Okay.
[122:44.31]A little fortification happening.
[122:45.63]I love that.
[122:46.53]There is.
[122:48.41]Charlie, I've sent you an alliance.
[122:49.81]Have you seen it?
[122:51.09]Oh, I see it.
[122:51.61]Yes, yes, yes.
[122:52.57]Oh, all right.
[122:53.01]Well, hey, gas can.
[122:56.26]Alliances, but it's just one country.
[123:02.15]Oh!
[123:03.55]When I'm allied, I get to see all the new map.
[123:07.33]Oh, shit!
[123:08.09]Let's go!
[123:09.71]Yeah, Gaskin, you're gonna wanna be my friend here, man.
[123:12.23]You wanna see the map.
[123:13.33]That's actually pretty advantageous.
[123:16.88]Did you just take Boston?
[123:19.14]No.
[123:20.30]That's fucking bullshit, dude.
[123:21.46]Alright, kid.
[123:22.38]Listen, that's fucking stupid.
[123:24.04]Alright, fucking listen, kid.
[123:27.22]I'll see you outside any dunkies anytime.
[123:29.38]Oh, shut the fuck up.
[123:30.02]You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.
[123:36.07]It's actually frightening it away.
[123:39.27]Oh, good expansion.
[123:40.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[123:41.49]I mean, I kind of feel like I can just... Go.
[123:52.62]Here.
[123:52.82]Mm-hmm.
[124:00.73]Mm-hmm.
[124:11.02]By the way, if you see the... The graph bar on the left, they're toggles.
[124:18.89]And you can click them for more info.
[124:22.09]Like how many points every section gets you.
[124:24.53]Oh, okay.
[124:25.95]Like New England only gets you one point here.
[124:27.55]It's kind of shit.
[124:28.91]But the best one's the Heartland.
[124:33.74]Oh.
[124:34.72]Why is Nevada in the Rocky Mountains?
[124:37.66]Oh, chill, Dez.
[124:41.63]No, it has mountains.
[124:43.65]Is it in the real world?
[124:44.63]What is in the real world?
[124:46.80]It's southwest, considered, right?
[124:51.42]I guess it is, right?
[124:52.46]Yeah, like in Arizona.
[124:55.94]We have an alliance, right, Lud?
[124:57.68]Oh, it's one of the strongest alliances that have ever been formed.
[125:00.48]Okay, then yeah, I'm going to... I haven't broken it off.
[125:03.10]I have no dreams of it.
[125:04.34]All right.
[125:04.70]I'm going to be real quick.
[125:09.65]All right, so yeah, that would say we should really take the heartland here.
[125:14.23]Yeah, that's a good call.
[125:22.29]You've just made a powerful enemy with Nebraska.
[125:27.24]No, they're chill.
[125:27.82]They like us.
[125:28.54]We're like boys.
[125:29.26]We were one of the finest governments they ever elected.
[125:31.96]Actually, our office was very well liked.
[125:41.60]Hmm.
[125:41.74]Jeremy, I'm going to let you go across Oklahoma and Arkansas, I think.
[125:47.43]I think the plan is you should probably take that.
[125:53.05]You know, let's take it to DMs.
[125:54.15]How did you just steamroll Louisiana like that?
[125:57.56]It was 4-5 and you only lost one troop.
[126:00.18]That's the power of Texas.
[126:01.92]What the fuck?
[126:04.54]You did only lose one.
[126:05.76]That was fucked up.
[126:15.08]This is a really interesting election map.
[126:23.29]Yeah, it was a weird year.
[126:25.47]This is an interesting presidential year.
[126:35.49]Just, uh, let me keep the heartland here.
[126:37.41]Yeah, this is big.
[126:41.62]This is either... Oh my god!
[126:44.30]This is a very bad move or it's a very good move.
[126:46.44]It depends on how the... How Arkansas does here.
[126:49.58]Whoa.
[126:50.06]It looks like we're just rolling over, so... Jesus Christ.
[126:56.17]That was good.
[126:56.55]That was decent.
[126:57.05]You went even.
[126:57.43]That was pretty good.
[126:58.29]Yeah.
[126:59.71]I wouldn't encroach on my territory here, Jerma.
[127:03.79]Yeah.
[127:07.63]That's probably what I do.
[127:12.96]There's just a queen in the Midwest.
[127:14.50]What the heck?
[127:15.05]Yeah, it established that.
[127:17.35]How did you get 15?
[127:20.37]What?
[127:21.85]I have three territories.
[127:24.49]That's cringe.
[127:25.39]That's everything that's cringe.
[127:28.63]They're still on that?
[127:30.21]Yep.
[127:30.47]They're all like beating that immediately when you said that you have that much territory.
[127:39.85]Cringe.
[127:41.54]All right, this is good for me.
[127:42.56]I need to win this.
[127:45.24]Oh, fuck yeah.
[127:46.02]All right.
[127:48.00]That's all.
[127:51.25]Uh, what do I want to do here, actually?
[127:55.31]Shit.
[127:56.95]Just, like, keep Arkansas fortified, I think.
[127:59.09]Like, we've been through a lot.
[128:01.22]I think it would befruits me to kill Oklahoma.
[128:10.86]You can probably take this whole region here.
[128:13.20]Oh.
[128:13.30]I'm not trying to spread too thin, though.
[128:15.66]Whoa.
[128:16.86]Don't do it, Ludwig.
[128:18.80]I leave the south for you, Charlie.
[128:20.70]Okay, yeah, I'll come through the south.
[128:26.73]I'm just Union Jack here.
[128:27.97]I don't believe in Manifest Destiny.
[128:30.47]Oh, okay.
[128:34.87]All right.
[128:38.69]Coming down with it?
[128:43.90]All right.
[128:45.31]Won't be two.
[128:45.77]Won't be two.
[128:46.63]You win this.
[128:47.75]I think you just fortified.
[128:51.07]I don't think you.
[128:51.85]I don't know.
[128:52.65]Louisiana.
[128:53.53]They get wild down there.
[128:55.49]I get wild.
[128:56.24]I get wild.
[128:56.96]They get a little wacky.
[128:58.06]I might.
[128:59.02]I might.
[129:00.32]Do your special move.
[129:01.18]Go team.
[129:04.27]No, Texas is a little too scary.
[129:06.11]How do I call off an attack?
[129:07.29]I had a 0% chance of winning, so.
[129:10.15]Zero?
[129:11.13]Yeah, it was actually zero.
[129:12.62]It was 2v2, though, right?
[129:14.24]It was 1v2, but Texas is apparently just fucking nasty with it.
[129:18.62]Oh, the misery.
[129:19.20]Yeah, Texas, they don't forget.
[129:20.34]Oh, wow.
[129:24.24]I didn't realize.
[129:25.02]Is that Alabama?
[129:27.42]It's Alabama on the left, right?
[129:31.25]You can only be attacked from Louisiana.
[129:33.17]That's actually pretty good for you.
[129:36.67]Yeah, you actually can.
[129:40.35]I don't really know what I do here.
[129:45.77]Hey, I'll cede to you the Midwest.
[129:48.73]Or at least not the Midwest.
[129:49.73]The Heartland, I should say.
[129:51.57]Yeah, I'd like to keep the Heartland.
[129:52.89]I'm just kind of happy there.
[129:57.05]Everybody's having a good time.
[129:58.37]You can send those six around to wrangle up.
[130:00.89]I freely seed both Nebraska and Arkansas.
[130:07.62]We appreciate that a lot.
[130:11.10]What state is this, Chad?
[130:14.40]Is this even a real state?
[130:15.97]This gets weird, though, real quick, because, Connor, I have to go through you to attack anybody.
[130:22.43]Well, you can go through Oklahoma and Arkansas.
[130:24.35]I can, but if you claim that, then you get bonuses.
[130:27.18]No, I don't want it, though.
[130:30.20]No.
[130:31.58]I don't get any bonuses, because I need New Mexico and Arizona, too.
[130:36.02]Well, then let me try to surround you from the left and bottom, so then they can only come at you from one side.
[130:43.61]Yeah, I gave you Oklahoma and Arkansas last round.
[130:47.71]I didn't care for those.
[130:48.35]It's a little concerning down here, that's all.
[130:51.02]Yeah, I got you.
[130:52.26]Um... Okay, I'm gonna end my attack here, I think.
[130:56.36]Everybody's in good spirits.
[131:03.22]I gotta move troops down here.
[131:04.30]If I have any.
[131:11.17]Everybody's pals.
[131:17.19]The Union's together.
[131:20.99]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta come through here.
[131:29.87]It's alright.
[131:39.70]Hi bumper.
[131:40.84]I'm just trying to figure out what the... This is gonna get ugly.
[131:46.58]This is actually really ugly already.
[131:51.29]Scary situation.
[131:52.13]We... We're just in a tough spot.
[131:56.05]We don't have any of the East.
[131:58.55]Oof, oof.
[131:59.25]Big reinforcements there.
[132:03.57]Oh my god!
[132:04.57]Yeah, Ludwig was cheating.
[132:08.38]Okay, let's do this.
[132:11.70]Actually, no.
[132:12.26]Let's do... You know what?
[132:15.72]You know what?
[132:17.32]I think I do like Arkansas.
[132:20.53]Let's do an even fight.
[132:21.87]Ludwig, you should, like, give up, like, a whole territory to, like, make it interesting.
[132:26.39]Let's do an even fight here, Jerma.
[132:28.30]Okay.
[132:29.32]You coming into, uh... I'll take it.
[132:32.22]Oh, Jesus.
[132:34.04]Big.
[132:35.12]Very big.
[132:37.85]Just because I'm bitter, I've taken Minnesota.
[132:46.18]What the fuck?
[132:46.74]What did I do?
[132:48.12]I'm bitter.
[132:49.36]What did I do?
[132:50.52]It was bitterness.
[132:52.13]What were you bitter about?
[132:53.79]Losing against Jerma.
[132:56.51]I'm not Jerma.
[132:57.93]It's like pick on someone your own size.
[132:59.54]Because I lost to Jerma, so I was like, okay, I need to win now.
[133:06.79]Wasn't gonna try to fight him again.
[133:07.99]I'm really scared of... Charlie, you're just steam rolling through the whole south here.
[133:13.55]Yeah.
[133:15.45]I didn't get any good cards.
[133:17.51]I like when he says, yeah, as he adds troops.
[133:23.84]I'm coming through Texas.
[133:24.98]These guys fucked me in the ass earlier.
[133:26.54]I want revenge.
[133:27.98]They'll hold you strong.
[133:29.66]Oh, baby.
[133:30.50]They folded.
[133:33.52]Alright.
[133:35.26]This is bad.
[133:37.90]We're in a tough spot.
[133:38.92]Yeah, we are.
[133:40.86]It might be in our best interest to, like, not work with each other and instead get different allies and, like, break them up.
[133:46.80]You might have to turn around and get rid of me and my cards.
[133:49.22]Depends on what he does here.
[133:51.56]Okay.
[133:53.44]I think... Oh, wait a minute.
[133:56.74]Hey, Charlie or Ludwig, any of you guys want to, like, be my pal instead of, like, one or the other?
[134:00.84]If you get Arizona, you get the whole territory.
[134:02.26]Yeah, yeah.
[134:03.06]I think I'm going to have to do that.
[134:04.36]Let's play it safe.
[134:05.66]I'm going to grab that.
[134:08.57]oh a lot of ones on the west coast huh thankfully it's so kind of isolated that you have you have to go through everybody to get over here yeah you get the stretch then uh oh what's my play here all right we're
[134:35.63]I don't know.
[134:36.89]The Heartland is just not much of a Heartland at this point.
[134:40.59]What has he got up in Michigan and this area?
[134:45.08]Minnesota is three.
[134:46.40]It looks like I can't even see Michigan.
[134:48.88]Illinois has got 11 right there.
[134:50.36]I think that's Illinois.
[134:52.08]Yeah, it's Illinois.
[134:54.18]Oh, there's no border there.
[134:55.96]You'd have to go up.
[134:58.53]You got to go through Minnesota.
[135:00.94]He's probably got nothing in this area.
[135:03.70]This whole area up here with Indiana, no way.
[135:07.75]He's got nine in Wisconsin, actually.
[135:09.37]Oh, my God.
[135:10.07]Oh, that's bad.
[135:11.41]Which is like, you know, it's not really cool.
[135:14.37]It's because we're big Rodgers fans over here.
[135:19.71]thought you were doing a thing where you knew we couldn't see so you just oh look here's I got 11 troops I got 20 troops right here and you got all ones I think what's better is you can't see and then you go in and there's a shit ton of troops you want to like alliance uh just leave me the heartland you know it sounds like it's just an alliance then I'd just be stomping out germa
[135:43.96]Honestly, you guys can make whatever alliances you want, but keep in mind, you're going to have to attack each other to get over here.
[135:51.24]So you're going to have to figure that out.
[135:54.78]I think Charlie goes by south and I go by north.
[135:57.28]Yeah, that might be the play.
[136:01.05]The cards are about to become a big factor soon, especially because they're progressive.
[136:05.11]Don't do that.
[136:07.75]Okay, Jeremy, I think I'm just going to step into your territory a little bit.
[136:12.39]Excuse me?
[136:13.41]I think I'm going to have to step into your territory a little bit.
[136:15.68]I'm a little scared.
[136:17.00]I got to want to like spread out a little bit.
[136:21.10]Connor, what do you think about the Rocky Mountains?
[136:23.62]You've always been like a Rocky Mountain guy to me.
[136:26.36]I've never been there, but I do get that vibe, yeah.
[136:29.64]You're there now.
[136:30.87]Is it nice?
[136:31.31]A lot of people have said that about me.
[136:33.51]Lud, would you give me, uh, Arkansas over there if I helped you collapse in on, like, the Nebraska, Minnesota area?
[136:41.85]I'll do you one better.
[136:42.95]I'll move out of Arkansas.
[136:44.33]Oh, that's even better.
[136:45.07]Fuck yeah.
[136:47.11]Guys, you gotta leave me alone.
[136:48.33]Okay, well... Journal, I still consider this a lines-on.
[136:54.45]Like, I just needed to move.
[136:56.43]Yeah, that's true.
[136:58.05]That's true.
[136:59.87]I'm just scared.
[137:01.33]I'll see what I can do down here.
[137:06.30]Let's go.
[137:07.20]Oh, Jesus.
[137:08.32]German, no.
[137:09.04]Don't do this.
[137:10.36]What the fuck?
[137:11.26]Why do none of my troops fight?
[137:13.80]Fuck.
[137:14.66]Thank God.
[137:15.54]Finally, someone with some balls here.
[137:17.38]Thanks, New Mexico.
[137:18.28]That second push was bold.
[137:22.38]They didn't do anything!
[137:24.06]Me and Charlie are not prospered for a civil war.
[137:26.34]We're very allied right now.
[137:28.21]Yeah, no, this is tight.
[137:30.61]Chairman, you could accept the request ticket if you want to see where it is.
[137:34.71]Right.
[137:36.41]It's back on.
[137:37.23]We're friends.
[137:38.09]We're friends again.
[137:41.72]Counter.
[137:42.84]You've been getting 15 every round.
[137:43.80]This is over.
[137:48.12]Honestly, we should all just collaborate to get rid of Ludwig because he's got 50 troops.
[137:52.33]Charlie, Charlie, consider it.
[137:54.63]Charlie, I think you should actually consider it.
[137:56.21]Ludwig is literally stomping everybody because he's three territories.
[137:59.67]Yeah, that's true, but I can't survive on my own.
[138:03.37]I have to suckle his bosom.
[138:04.23]This is what happened last game, though.
[138:06.89]You can survive, though, because we'll be on your side.
[138:09.07]I don't know.
[138:10.73]He's scary.
[138:11.71]We're a very strong part of the country.
[138:14.34]Charlie, you wouldn't betray me, right?
[138:15.96]No, I wouldn't.
[138:16.60]I couldn't.
[138:18.39]What happens when it's just down to you two, and he's got, like, 50 troops on the board, and you've got Texas... Cringe.
[138:26.15]He's gonna come for you.
[138:27.05]He's gonna end it.
[138:28.79]Now he has the Heartland, too, which is worth plus five.
[138:31.16]This is bad.
[138:33.16]Then it's just all a matter of, you know, we did our best down here in the South.
[138:38.72]At least I still have a...
[138:46.41]Wow, I have Wyoming and Montana.
[138:53.02]You sounded so excited about that.
[138:54.50]I think that's like the smallest segment of the population.
[138:57.93]I have like eight guys, like eight people.
[139:04.67]You just reacted the same way as if you had found in the fridge you're really hungry and it's like taco leftovers from six days ago.
[139:11.84]It's all that I have left.
[139:12.92]And it's just like, yeah, well, I got these tacos that I didn't eat.
[139:17.54]Gotta be excited about something in the world.
[139:19.54]All right.
[139:27.31]All right.
[139:27.61]We're doing great.
[139:28.29]We're doing great.
[139:28.95]I have three.
[139:32.01]You can live another day if you just go east.
[139:35.21]I was living...
[139:36.81]My hope was right that I was going to get three cards and I just turned them in.
[139:40.82]But the problem is none of my cards match.
[139:42.32]So now I have three cards and three soldiers.
[139:48.95]So the card turn in was three?
[139:53.89]I don't have anything to use.
[139:57.40]Uh, wait, there we go.
[140:00.12]Sure.
[140:00.28]Let me just take Kansas back.
[140:01.52]Uh, no, it's like maybe that.
[140:09.72]Wait, the march across the- nevermind.
[140:14.54]I used to like Ludwig, but for some reason this game makes me hate him.
[140:18.14]The burning gash.
[140:19.54]Yes, I agree.
[140:20.55]You just got a new hater, apparently, from this game.
[140:24.43]Is this a chat message or are you saying this?
[140:27.23]Oh, that's a chat message.
[140:28.01]That is a chat message.
[140:29.25]Somebody's very upset about this.
[140:31.49]Hey, they're up in arms.
[140:32.73]I feel like I just made good alliances in great war tactics.
[140:38.76]I said I used to like Ludwig.
[140:39.94]Now I only like Aatrox.
[140:41.10]Yeah.
[140:41.40]Now I feel that, man.
[140:49.28]Honestly, we've got to do something.
[140:50.54]We've got to do something.
[140:51.32]Yeah.
[140:51.48]We've got to make a big move.
[140:52.48]We've got to make a move.
[140:53.30]We have to.
[140:53.74]That's all right.
[140:57.32]That's good.
[140:58.18]I'm just trying to break him up.
[140:59.28]That's it.
[140:59.88]That's all I'm trying to do.
[141:02.90]Minnesota, maybe?
[141:04.26]That's just one, right?
[141:06.33]Don't fight that.
[141:10.60]Holy shit.
[141:11.44]Everybody has to go after Ludwig, otherwise it's over for everybody.
[141:14.06]Charlie, you gotta switch up.
[141:16.02]I see what's on his board, by the way.
[141:18.48]If I did try, I couldn't win.
[141:20.14]No one can win anyways.
[141:22.39]I'm playing for second, boys.
[141:27.24]I have amassed an army on Massachusetts.
[141:31.05]Yeah, he put the troops in deep.
[141:34.21]If I see one teabag, they're losing their shit.
[141:37.59]If you go for whatever state that is, Kansas and Colorado, we're going to burn all the farmland.
[141:44.30]You're going to get nothing out of it.
[141:46.68]You're going to burn the crops?
[141:48.20]Everything's gone.
[141:49.22]It's going to be unusable.
[141:51.49]Whatever.
[141:51.87]I'm fine over here.
[141:55.05]45% of the whole U.S.
[141:55.95]economy is over here in California anyways.
[141:58.33]I'm fine.
[141:58.85]If I was in my own country, I'd be the 7th richest country in the world.
[142:06.47]It is your fortifying right now.
[142:07.69]Are you fortifying something over there?
[142:09.25]Oh, shit.
[142:09.61]I didn't know it was my turn.
[142:13.27]It's not much for us to fortify.
[142:14.44]No, it's not much.
[142:15.42]Sorry about that.
[142:19.79]Charlie, neither of us are attacking you because we know how this ends, right?
[142:22.83]Like, we're... You're the only hope.
[142:25.39]I don't think you guys understand.
[142:26.69]There's... There's just... We're just... We're running them thin as much as we can.
[142:31.41]Hey, leave Montana.
[142:35.19]Make it interesting.
[142:38.39]Wait, actually leave Montana, though.
[142:42.05]It'd be, like, cringe if you took it.
[142:43.15]Because then I'm out of the game.
[142:45.20]That was cringe.
[142:46.48]Oh.
[142:46.70]Oh.
[142:53.25]Oh, I think this is a little Manifest Destiny here.
[142:57.69]Sorry, I'm offline.
[142:58.61]The alliance is over.
[142:59.61]That's what it just said.
[143:00.33]Holy shit.
[143:00.83]This is insane.
[143:05.88]I want to see this board because I'm very curious.
[143:09.44]It's insane.
[143:10.10]I can see it now.
[143:13.76]Here, Germo.
[143:14.84]I made an alliance with you except that you can see.
[143:22.04]Thirteen over in- yeah that- okay.
[143:23.90]Yeah.
[143:25.80]Made that like analogy of like your friend who invites you over just to kick your ass in the game earlier.
[143:30.46]You gotta let me spin one more out there.
[143:32.67]Alright.
[143:35.65]I'll leave one.
[143:38.13]You don't wanna fuck with the south, I'll tell you right now.
[143:41.29]We get- we get rowdy down here.
[143:43.27]He left Jeremy, he didn't leave me.
[143:44.89]Charlie, I'm coming.
[143:45.69]I'm coming.
[143:46.95]Yeah, he did leave me and he didn't leave you.
[143:48.58]I- I did leave him.
[143:51.03]but just as an insurance policy.
[143:54.01]What a fucked up weird election map.
[143:55.47]Yeah, I was like the one independent party that spent every cent that I own in one state.
[144:04.39]I think I could win here.
[144:05.71]I went to every single county in the entire state and shook every single person's hand to make sure that I got this one state.
[144:16.90]This is so stupid.
[144:21.04]You made a big mistake leaving Florida alive.
[144:23.37]All right.
[144:26.89]All right, gentlemen, what you got?
[144:28.31]Florida.
[144:31.43]I'm fucking coming.
[144:34.57]Oh, my God.
[144:35.81]Yeah.
[144:36.25]The Florida Gambit.
[144:38.23]Hey, hey, come get me.
[144:40.43]Come kill me.
[144:41.05]Come kill me.
[144:41.53]I'm coming.
[144:43.55]I'm working my way over.
[144:44.39]That's actually genius.
[144:45.75]You get those cars.
[144:46.61]You get my cars.
[144:47.39]You'll have to go through New Mexico.
[144:55.26]Oh, I can't attack Arkansas from here?
[144:56.66]Okay.
[144:58.26]Louisiana it is.
[144:59.66]I hope you get a turn in.
[145:01.38]We're coming in.
[145:02.04]We're coming in.
[145:02.50]I'm coming.
[145:04.08]I'm coming.
[145:04.54]Hold strong, New Mexico!
[145:06.64]Go Oklahoma and then go to Colorado, I think.
[145:09.83]No, no, you just go.
[145:10.75]I can make it.
[145:12.67]I can make it.
[145:13.55]Turn in.
[145:14.01]Come on.
[145:14.49]Go around.
[145:15.85]Come on.
[145:16.67]Hold strong.
[145:17.49]Hold strong, German army.
[145:19.01]Squirming.
[145:20.53]Yes!
[145:21.47]There it is.
[145:21.95]There's hope.
[145:25.78]It's a mutual agreement.
[145:27.50]Oh shit, I can't watch anymore.
[145:29.60]No, you have to click spectate on the bottom left.
[145:31.96]Yep.
[145:32.52]Are you good?
[145:33.32]Uh, there's no reason to push any- Move one guy.
[145:41.53]I wish I got you- I wish I got you to turn him.
[145:45.21]Oh, put him back!
[145:46.01]What the fuck?
[145:46.59]What?
[145:47.05]Oh god.
[145:47.75]Eh, it's fine.
[145:48.91]He's got- What?
[145:51.71]New Mexico's pretty strong.
[145:54.17]Oh my god.
[145:57.90]I'm pushing you all the way back to Florida.
[146:01.26]Not if New Mexico has anything to say about it.
[146:03.47]I'm doing the thing Cotter said.
[146:08.23]Stand strong.
[146:17.41]The first game, I was hype on it.
[146:18.88]This one, I'm sad.
[146:21.88]You won't get through Florida this easily.
[146:23.72]All right, I'll give you one more turn.
[146:26.26]Yeah, I was going to say, you got to do the, like, the gentleman rules, which is, like, you guys are playing a baseball game with a friend, and it's like, oh, hey, hey, just throw the ball, like, into the outfield one time.
[146:36.11]Like, I got to go on first base, and then you try to score, like, run all the way home.
[146:39.81]Did you guys ever do that?
[146:42.09]I didn't do that, but I hear you.
[146:43.09]I've never played baseball with my friends ever.
[146:45.29]Yeah, I understand what you're saying, at least.
[146:47.43]You need, like, a lot of friends to play baseball in, like, a group, right?
[146:50.67]Yeah, I think we stuck to, like,
[146:54.12]throw the ball into the outfield and then like I'm gonna run around and go home yeah like just commit an error oh wait it's my turn oh this is sad your age is showing go florida all right this is our last stand
[147:19.42]I'm coming for Georgia.
[147:20.86]I'm on first base.
[147:21.84]We're down by two runs.
[147:23.72]Guy at the plate is up.
[147:24.94]He like bunts.
[147:26.12]Roll the ball into the outfield.
[147:28.44]Give us a chance.
[147:29.31]Come on, gentlemen's rules.
[147:30.19]I have a 0% win on all fronts, but stats have been wrong before.
[147:38.79]Yep, I'm coming.
[147:40.89]Wait a second.
[147:41.87]Oh my god, the last guy.
[147:48.75]oh there it is all right fortify there build up I just put the strongest soldier we had there master chiefs in florida 61 dude I'm sorry guys I'm sorry
[148:13.44]I think me and charlie's alliance was a little too strong at the start I didn't get out of the south I think the game there's so much strategy to literally picking where you're going uh like at the start yeah and then people were just kind of we're just clicking there was like there's like a real method to it that we should probably figure out it's a little bit of a strategy where you want your uh where you want your boys to be fog of war makes it harder to
[148:37.88]yeah the I actually think that's why I was able to run throughs because I had an alliance with charlie and I could see all the the map because our alliance I'm missing gas can't have friend request uh you guys don't want to play a third one do you I'm game for whatever I'm down if we like have like a setting maybe do better settings on that
[149:02.76]There is a map called Castle, and it's just one castle.
[149:11.32]And you own different sections of the castle.
[149:15.45]Cool.
[149:17.15]All right.
[149:18.89]Interesting.
[149:20.27]Or this one's also kind of interesting.
[149:25.75]E-Buyland.
[149:33.87]Alright, we'll do one free buy.
[149:36.89]So wait, was manual placement good or bad?
[149:41.91]It's okay.
[149:42.87]I mean, auto makes it go faster.
[149:45.35]Yeah, auto is definitely faster.
[149:47.78]Okay, let's do auto.
[149:48.40]Was fog of war good?
[149:53.00]No strong opinion for me.
[149:54.98]Probably not.
[149:56.86]Thanks a prime, Zach.
[149:58.48]I'll keep it off.
[150:00.52]And then... Progressive card bonus, I'll keep on.
[150:03.86]Alright, code is in chat.
[150:11.62]We'll make this the finale.
[150:13.44]That was good.
[150:16.38]Playing MDOS games.
[150:17.82]I thought my fucking computer blue screened.
[150:19.96]Like, this thing just took up the whole screen.
[150:21.86]And this one line of text.
[150:23.08]I was like, my computer.
[150:23.82]I was about to say, sorry, I gotta go.
[150:28.65]Alright, there's the code.
[150:32.51]I don't want to show anybody.
[150:38.01]Where do I use it?
[150:41.02]Where you have every time, no?
[150:45.22]I can invite you personally.
[150:47.32]Hold on.
[150:48.46]I invited you personally.
[150:49.38]Where do I go to profile?
[150:52.14]Oh, here it is.
[150:52.60]Hold on.
[150:54.55]Hold on a little bit.
[150:58.56]Oh, don't leave.
[150:59.26]What the heck?
[151:02.61]Did not mean to leave the game.
[151:03.51]I'm sorry.
[151:07.45]Hey.
[151:16.28]Here we go.
[151:27.13]Can you send me another one of them?
[151:30.55]Uh, the invite?
[151:31.71]Yeah.
[151:32.45]Uh, it says already sent.
[151:34.37]Oh, okay.
[151:34.96]Hold on, I can join.
[151:35.94]I think.
[151:39.08]Spend five tokens.
[151:41.06]There.
[151:41.34]Alright, let's go!
[151:42.92]I bought an alien guy.
[151:45.48]Alright.
[151:46.12]Alright, totally random.
[151:48.11]It's just, uh, uh, E-Biland is a bunch of islands.
[151:51.27]A bunch of islands?
[151:55.27]E-Biland.
[151:56.77]Yeah.
[151:57.27]Yeah, like the streamer.
[151:59.07]Is it like a
[152:00.45]a collaboration I don't think so but that'd be crazy oh my little alien guy was so cool okay all right so it's ludwig and then charlie with the same colors that's good I'm glad it's been consistent the whole time yeah and then connor and then jerma there's just like normal rules or what's weird
[152:25.43]The only thing that's weird is it is weird islands and progressive cards.
[152:36.39]Yeah, I don't know this map.
[152:38.45]Yeah, I don't either, to be honest.
[152:41.30]But I do think I want this.
[152:45.36]I got to go pee real quick.
[152:46.54]I'll be right back.
[152:47.26]My turn's in like three turns anyways.
[152:48.26]Yeah, you got time.
[152:50.16]Oh, I want to control barbecue.
[152:51.68]You're back.
[152:55.48]I also realized we were playing with kind of a cringe rule.
[152:59.52]That was cringe.
[153:00.70]It wasn't true random dice rolls.
[153:04.62]Yeah, you would know.
[153:07.65]That was cringe.
[153:11.77]It was hurtful, if anything.
[153:12.87]That's cringe.
[153:22.39]I knew those dice weren't random.
[153:23.59]I knew something was in them.
[153:25.77]He knew there was a little... They were weighted.
[153:27.62]A little trouble afoot.
[154:01.09]Big man, it's you?
[154:02.63]Yeah, I'm thinking I'm trying to figure out the best plan of attack for me here.
[154:06.79]Wait, the names of these lands are all literally like Spanish YouTubers.
[154:10.46]Wait, are they?
[154:11.54]Yeah.
[154:12.74]Dude, I think this might just be a map Ibai actually made.
[154:16.58]Or it's like Ludwig land.
[154:18.69]I want that.
[154:21.67]Did Ibai get his own map in this game chat?
[154:30.34]It was in the map description.
[154:32.60]That's crazy.
[154:35.76]Oh, my God.
[154:42.83]I feel like I'm already losing.
[154:44.97]Did he earn, like, sales?
[154:47.39]What?
[154:48.99]Wow.
[154:49.69]Yeah, that's what balanced dice remove.
[154:54.36]Or random dice remove, I should say.
[154:55.78]I am back.
[154:57.22]Technically, one soldier could beat an army of 100.
[155:04.76]Why would they call it E-Myland?
[155:06.90]Makes sense.
[155:10.08]Did you get something like the Steam Workshop?
[155:12.84]No, I just had it.
[155:14.08]I don't know.
[155:14.58]I've never played it before.
[155:15.40]It was just in my maps.
[155:16.78]I didn't have to download it.
[155:18.22]I think you just did a partnership with the game.
[155:20.64]Oh.
[155:22.54]That's pretty cool.
[155:22.94]Is Connor saying all the map names or just different YouTubers?
[155:28.91]All the different islands.
[155:29.85]Well, they are.
[155:31.83]Yeah.
[155:32.45]Different Spanish YouTubers.
[155:34.61]Are they?
[155:36.13]Apparently.
[155:36.69]It's like barbecue.
[155:39.35]If you hit the graph in the top on the left bar, and then you hit the globe icon, it'll show you them all.
[155:46.91]Oh, okay.
[155:47.30]I was going to say there's like industrial pier, tech plant, industrial cargo.
[155:52.36]Those are interesting names.
[155:53.78]No, no, no.
[155:55.46]Yeah, he goes by Block A. Yeah, go team.
[156:09.31]No.
[156:11.67]Don't spread yourself too thin, Connor.
[156:12.83]Fortify.
[156:13.67]Yeah.
[156:14.09]I have no idea where I'm going to go here.
[156:22.20]It is an interesting map.
[156:25.80]Hmm.
[156:29.09]Oh, that's not what I meant to do.
[156:31.05]That's not what I meant to do at all.
[156:33.71]Alright.
[156:34.67]You have actually a great start at the top, that 2-4-4.
[156:36.87]I do.
[156:38.07]I don't know if you missed this, but the dice are true random now.
[156:45.63]True random?
[156:47.30]Yeah, before it was balanced.
[156:49.94]It was the saddest fucking thing.
[156:51.32]I threw four against one and lost.
[156:54.04]Oh, God.
[156:54.60]Yeah.
[156:56.18]Okay, well...
[156:59.07]Oh.
[157:03.36]I mean, I guess I could just try for this.
[157:06.58]Blue has no idea what they're doing.
[157:08.02]Oh.
[157:17.59]Yes!
[157:20.49]Oh my god.
[157:21.90]The restaurants up there from me are very strong.
[157:24.50]You don't want to fuck with those chefs.
[157:26.34]I think I just lost the game.
[157:28.14]I think true random, you don't want to do Blitz because you could just lose your entire army in one fell click.
[157:34.87]Oh my god.
[157:36.45]He lost like everybody.
[157:39.63]You did not lose the game.
[157:41.65]You got the guy in the bottom aisle with the 3-3-2.
[157:44.02]Because you can do the same thing in return as well, right?
[157:46.32]Yeah, that's true.
[157:47.50]Oh, that's so demoralizing.
[157:49.86]I can't feel good.
[157:51.68]Those are the strongest chefs in the seven seas.
[157:54.14]Don't feel bad.
[157:54.88]Yeah, it's like some one-piece chef.
[157:58.33]Cool.
[157:58.77]Let's see.
[157:59.15]All right.
[157:59.39]Well, it could work in the reverse then, couldn't it?
[158:07.39]My boys are too struggling in this one Well, I'm going to end there because I'm very concerned about having no oh god, okay Good game.
[158:19.21]All right We're going over here Hey Charlie
[158:25.09]yeah yeah listen I'm thinking an alliance all right I like I think red's cool I'm I'm trying to take on during the bottom right maybe how has he already got plus nine everybody ludwig just every time just gets in an area and just starts building massive stacks so early we gotta get rid of this now and I'm gonna bring it up to the board blue you're blue okay guys
[158:55.83]We should... We should get rid of Ludwig because he's already building like huge stacks already.
[159:00.90]I'm also open to that.
[159:01.66]I'm open to like three versus one.
[159:03.36]Yeah.
[159:03.96]We can try and gang up here.
[159:06.74]Hey!
[159:07.40]I'm very much open to that.
[159:08.42]Hey, relax everybody.
[159:10.16]Come on.
[159:10.86]Hey, come on.
[159:11.98]It's been an overwhelming cry out from the audience today that yellow has been cringe.
[159:16.50]I think you are the audience who's been saying that.
[159:19.40]We cannot let him get to three, four wins in a row.
[159:22.82]No way.
[159:25.26]I agree.
[159:25.96]It'd be impressive though.
[159:26.88]Let's kill him.
[159:27.98]You'd almost be like, wow, great job Ludwig.
[159:30.62]It would be impressive, but... It's been a pleasure watching you succeed so, so much.
[159:40.58]Get him.
[159:40.87]Let's do one of these.
[159:43.79]What are those dice?
[159:49.34]What just happened?
[159:51.54]What happened there?
[159:52.14]You didn't lose any troops on that fight.
[159:54.18]Those are my alien dice, Ludwig.
[159:55.70]Those are my alien dice that I bought.
[159:58.44]You have like a new avatar.
[160:00.26]Yeah, he's a little alien guy.
[160:01.58]The dice look weird.
[160:03.72]They're hard to differentiate.
[160:05.34]They have weights in them.
[160:06.18]Okay, let's... I kind of messed up here, to be honest.
[160:25.96]How much is that prison area up there giving you a turn?
[160:30.22]So, if you click on the left bars and then you click the globe, it'll show you.
[160:34.61]Oh, okay.
[160:34.89]There it is.
[160:35.71]It's plus four.
[160:36.47]Damn.
[160:37.47]It's the smallest on the map.
[160:39.17]Although, I don't think the map is very balanced.
[160:40.79]Like, Ondra should be giving way more than six.
[160:43.97]I'm going to take the bottom left here, but after that... The fact that he gets five is crazy.
[160:49.20]After that, I think we start teaming up a lot.
[160:51.84]Yeah.
[160:52.62]They're all you.
[160:55.92]So I'm not going to do Blitz.
[160:58.44]Yeah, I think Blitz is a mistake.
[160:59.78]I was normal rolling.
[161:01.90]Yeah, so he's got to go like two, one, one.
[161:05.21]I mean, it's always better to do three because you just have better odds.
[161:07.61]Wow, I'm going Blitz.
[161:11.19]I mean, you immediately won, so fair enough.
[161:18.31]Perfect win again.
[161:19.00]All right.
[161:20.88]There it is.
[161:21.26]There you go.
[161:24.18]And we will not attack each other.
[161:25.48]Charlie, you still need the little boat up there to get the bonus for that area.
[161:30.55]What boat?
[161:31.43]The one I'm on.
[161:33.57]Yeah, the five and the one on the left, so my one at the bottom there.
[161:36.59]Oh, what?
[161:37.53]Oh, no.
[161:38.19]That's not good.
[161:39.63]So, Charlie, if you click on the three, the bar graph on the left, and then you click the globe and make it yellow, it'll show you the outline of everything.
[161:46.91]Oh, okay.
[161:47.65]I see.
[161:49.91]Unlucky.
[161:50.45]Unlucky.
[161:50.83]Didn't know that.
[161:53.63]Thanks for the biscuit.
[161:59.64]When is your turn, Ludwig?
[162:00.93]Okay.
[162:02.51]I know exactly what you're doing.
[162:04.59]Wait, what do you think I'm doing?
[162:05.93]Talk to me.
[162:06.59]You're going... I mean, you're going to take a buy, right?
[162:10.31]Right, yeah.
[162:10.79]Very obviously.
[162:12.45]And then you're going to go from there.
[162:13.82]I think you're going to go up.
[162:15.74]I don't think you're going to go down.
[162:16.68]There's way too much going on down here.
[162:18.08]You're going to go up.
[162:18.52]You're going to wrap around.
[162:19.40]Try to go to the top right.
[162:20.28]You're going to try to secure the top right.
[162:21.92]And then you'll have two flanks.
[162:24.78]I think...
[162:27.45]Can I be honest with you, Jerma?
[162:29.79]You sound like a crazy person right now.
[162:31.64]I am happy and content with just my two Isles, Ibai and Ilohuan.
[162:39.48]That's it for me.
[162:42.77]He's going top right, so we need to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening.
[162:46.37]I disagree with it vehemently.
[162:49.23]Slanderous, almost.
[162:51.98]He's back.
[162:55.08]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[162:56.44]Oh, Jesus.
[162:58.41]That's rough.
[162:58.81]What just happened?
[162:59.83]No, I was just taking the bottom right.
[163:02.01]Need the boat, though.
[163:04.17]How do you have your hand in every one of these things?
[163:09.43]Luck of the draw, I guess.
[163:10.76]I don't know.
[163:12.50]To claim the territories, you have all the boats, your presence on every boat.
[163:18.18]I do have a lot of boat presence.
[163:21.27]Yeah, I like to say mobile, I guess.
[163:22.73]I'm kind of a pirate at heart.
[163:23.79]I like, uh, you ever see the show One Piece?
[163:25.68]It's one of my favorite shows.
[163:26.76]I think it's why.
[163:27.70]Yeah, it's a great show.
[163:28.76]Are you caught up on that?
[163:30.76]There's no way, right?
[163:32.96]Uh, I've seen like maybe three episodes total 15 years ago.
[163:39.10]That's all you need.
[163:40.08]And you gave it the rating great show?
[163:43.72]Yeah.
[163:44.88]Jerm, I'm trusting you on top, right?
[163:46.78]Yeah, oh yeah.
[163:47.16]Everybody's friends, everybody's pals.
[163:50.03]Yeah, I would say you should probably take it.
[163:53.29]Yeah, maybe at some point.
[163:57.57]Charlie, I'm going to leave that Revan alone.
[164:00.01]Okay, okay.
[164:01.23]It looks like you guys are all talking amongst each other.
[164:03.53]Listen, we're going to have to start planning ahead here.
[164:06.83]Yeah, this is getting scary.
[164:08.77]Do you want to team up with me, Jerma?
[164:15.96]Really?
[164:17.30]Interesting.
[164:18.32]Like you mean it?
[164:20.29]I don't know if that's super beneficial, though.
[164:22.83]I don't think it's beneficial for you at all right now, Jerma.
[164:25.21]No.
[164:26.05]No, I'm sorry.
[164:27.61]I'm sorry.
[164:28.93]No, I'm sticking.
[164:29.79]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[164:31.49]No, I'm sorry.
[164:32.23]We need to get him out of here, and then we see what's left.
[164:34.61]Wait, you're not attacking Ibai, are you?
[164:37.66]I'm considering some of my options here.
[164:39.98]That would be foolish.
[164:42.08]Well, I mean, I've got a time limit here, so talk to me.
[164:44.24]What are your terms?
[164:46.26]Don't attack Ibai.
[164:47.12]I don't attack any other territory except for Ibai.
[164:51.92]Are you going to attack Charlie or Connor?
[164:54.10]No.
[164:54.84]They're going to attack us.
[164:55.67]I'm only taking the one piece on the boat.
[164:58.59]Think about it.
[164:59.21]It makes sense.
[165:00.79]Your one piece on the boat.
[165:02.15]Take everything I have over there, by the way, too.
[165:04.49]And Whirlybee.
[165:05.41]I don't even care about those lawyers.
[165:06.81]I hate them.
[165:11.24]It's one of those can't live with him, can't live without him situation.
[165:13.24]You can take those two, honestly.
[165:15.08]I don't want to.
[165:16.30]I'm kind of afraid because you're spread out too thin.
[165:21.21]Yeah.
[165:21.57]No, I think that's fair.
[165:25.23]What do we got out of there?
[165:26.65]He'll get it.
[165:27.11]He'll get it by, but that's all right.
[165:28.07]He'll get it by.
[165:28.45]Okay.
[165:39.70]He's got so many troops.
[165:40.56]It's ridiculous.
[165:41.68]I'm trying to think of a strategy we could pull off here.
[165:47.67]I'm just in the process.
[165:48.59]Charlie, Charlie, I have an idea.
[165:49.99]What's the idea?
[165:50.59]Hit me.
[165:51.05]This involves all of us.
[165:52.09]Okay, Charlie, on the top there, you have five, right?
[165:54.79]Yeah, yeah.
[165:55.69]You could move one of those up to that port at the top left.
[165:58.81]That is one of Jerma's.
[166:00.51]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[166:01.07]And then you can go all the way around and fight Ludwig at the back.
[166:04.84]Yeah, it's going to be a 4v4.
[166:06.04]Or at least we have like a border there.
[166:10.70]Oh, yeah.
[166:11.44]That is a... That's a massive vulnerability right there.
[166:24.95]Not attacking?
[166:27.20]Nah, I wouldn't dream of it.
[166:28.74]He's got so much, man.
[166:29.70]He's got so much already.
[166:35.34]I might go for that risky maneuver.
[166:37.98]The old backdoor reach around.
[166:41.37]Guys, hey, I'm a pacifist.
[166:43.95]You know?
[166:44.19]I'm coming in.
[166:45.43]Oh my god.
[166:45.89]That's big.
[166:49.75]Charlie, you know how I left you in the bottom left here.
[166:52.05]I have 11 guys.
[166:53.19]I didn't even touch you.
[166:54.57]Yeah, but that's because you knew how strong the hearts were of those sailors.
[166:57.89]I'm coming in.
[166:59.49]The prison holds!
[167:01.55]Oh no!
[167:02.31]That was good.
[167:02.91]That was good.
[167:03.35]Oh, scary.
[167:04.35]The prison junction holds.
[167:07.51]Um...
[167:09.43]He's got the 11 right there that he can move up, but he cannot attack you with that 11 right now.
[167:15.44]He would have to fortify first.
[167:17.78]Don't get block C. No, come on.
[167:21.88]You might just want to leave him there and just see how he plays it.
[167:24.94]Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to take this whole thing and stay low.
[167:33.30]What color?
[167:33.80]I am green currently.
[167:37.89]Yeah.
[167:38.41]Should I even bother getting block A and B?
[167:40.35]Where is that?
[167:43.10]I think you consider block A or B. I think you stay right there just because if you go down to... Yeah, I can't take block C. I know that for sure.
[167:54.44]I was wondering if it was worth for block A and B, but probably not.
[167:58.78]If he's going to fortify up here, he'll do it.
[168:01.09]So even if you take one of them, he'll do the other one.
[168:04.85]Yeah, true, true, true.
[168:08.04]And I know he can hear us right now, but you know what?
[168:09.70]Who cares?
[168:10.08]Hey, what are you guys talking about?
[168:13.46]Fun games.
[168:16.68]Alright.
[168:21.63]He's going to attack from Ibai.
[168:23.59]I think he's trying to get this boat.
[168:26.23]He wants to be able to have this attack front from the boat.
[168:32.14]That's where his reserves are going.
[168:44.11]There it is.
[168:46.87]We win these?
[168:49.19]That's big.
[168:49.83]That's big for us.
[168:50.51]Yeah.
[168:50.67]We needed that.
[168:51.65]Fair enough.
[168:52.09]We needed that really bad.
[168:54.66]Okay.
[168:55.62]Um...
[168:59.79]We need this.
[169:01.15]That's big.
[169:02.25]No, it's not.
[169:02.69]We lost.
[169:03.41]Oh, that's... That's all right.
[169:06.20]No, there's an opportunity because I can put some troops up there and I can get rid of it.
[169:12.74]You're getting rid of my loading dock?
[169:15.58]Yeah.
[169:16.64]I mean, come on.
[169:17.60]It's a loading dock.
[169:18.98]These men need jobs.
[169:21.16]That's a vulnerability.
[169:22.32]That gives you an opportunity to come in.
[169:23.82]You could put 15 troops there and just wipe us all out.
[169:26.90]They have families, Jerma.
[169:30.56]Alright.
[169:31.26]Charlie's an ally.
[169:31.92]I'm gonna just pull something, you know?
[169:38.05]Alright.
[169:45.47]Should I... I gotta at least put one here.
[169:48.68]To get rid of the loading dock.
[169:56.34]I win this fight.
[169:56.96]I want you to know.
[169:57.58]You're not winning a 1v1 against my loading dock soldiers.
[170:00.01]You're not.
[170:01.35]Then I've got to get rid of them.
[170:02.47]I've got to load up something here.
[170:03.92]These are blue-collar men.
[170:05.24]You think a processing plant worker's beating me?
[170:11.82]Let's do the one I know I need to do first here.
[170:13.57]We're going Blitz mode.
[170:16.29]Good win there.
[170:17.43]Good win.
[170:18.03]Very good.
[170:18.97]Very good.
[170:19.97]Alright, two in a row.
[170:23.49]Oh my god.
[170:23.79]That's huge.
[170:24.51]We lost again.
[170:25.75]I keep thinking we win.
[170:26.93]I keep thinking we win.
[170:28.37]That's huge.
[170:28.79]That's huge.
[170:29.55]I'm optimistic.
[170:37.01]oh man that's huge I love the that's huge it's surely you won't like fortify up there though you don't even want it can I even bring can I bring anybody up there I can yeah you can bring those boys I need to get we can't just let him steamroll this
[171:07.60]It would be awfully dumb of Ludwig to even try to take the top right because he's worried about the top left.
[171:12.55]And the bottom left.
[171:13.55]Yeah, we've got him on his heels.
[171:15.91]Charlie, you might be able to take it by next turn.
[171:20.13]If I push from where?
[171:21.85]Oh, from the three, yeah.
[171:24.91]If I push from the restaurant.
[171:27.62]Yeah, that'd be huge.
[171:30.92]Well, now he's afraid.
[171:31.88]That's how we know he's terrified.
[171:33.22]They were in his head.
[171:34.96]That's what we wanted him to do.
[171:37.63]Watch these soldiers hold for us at the prison junction.
[171:43.41]For my city.
[171:43.93]Oh!
[171:46.63]Boys, please!
[171:47.66]God!
[171:48.42]Yes!
[171:48.80]Good fight.
[171:50.76]Hey, they're trying.
[171:51.34]They're trying.
[171:52.66]He lost a little bit there.
[171:54.18]He did.
[171:54.48]He lost a little.
[171:55.10]I did take a casualty.
[171:56.12]I did take a casualty.
[172:02.14]Um, what do I want to do next?
[172:08.62]I hear that, like, the Yellow Nation, like, they don't really, like, want to fight.
[172:11.83]Like, they're, like, tired of war.
[172:15.27]But they don't want to, like, go back over there.
[172:16.61]Talking about my people?
[172:17.87]Yeah.
[172:21.17]Oh my god.
[172:21.85]You just got, oh my god.
[172:23.07]You just got absolutely annihilated by my Filter Bay workers.
[172:27.09]That's, that's big.
[172:28.53]It was a 92% chance.
[172:31.71]Yeah, we don't believe in numbers over here in Filter Bay.
[172:34.87]It's huge.
[172:36.35]Actually huge.
[172:38.61]A 92% chance.
[172:40.59]Yeah, it means nothing to us.
[172:41.93]In the drain.
[172:43.15]I'm just coming in.
[172:44.77]I'm just coming in.
[172:45.49]How about that?
[172:46.40]How about that?
[172:47.36]Oh, wow.
[172:48.62]How about that?
[172:49.56]Oh, baby.
[172:50.02]This might be it for me, boys.
[172:52.08]I really needed to stomp them out there.
[172:53.88]That's tough.
[172:55.06]That's tough.
[172:55.65]Maybe I should have just kept the 11.
[173:01.48]Okay.
[173:02.04]I don't love that.
[173:03.24]Come on.
[173:03.52]My three hold, though.
[173:04.48]Imagine.
[173:05.56]Imagine block C. They won't do it.
[173:07.70]They won't fight with any motivation.
[173:10.46]How do I know which one I'm putting here?
[173:15.64]You attack first, and then you place troops after.
[173:19.90]Okay.
[173:21.48]I think we're good, right?
[173:23.02]Nice.
[173:29.16]Alright.
[173:30.40]Do we want to take Ibai from him?
[173:32.93]What's worth more?
[173:34.63]Ibai's worth more.
[173:36.23]Okay.
[173:41.13]What would be crazy is you get damage on both, so then he has no bonus.
[173:45.58]They're squishing me out.
[173:47.08]Oh, I sent all my troops.
[173:48.30]That's okay.
[173:49.66]They're squishing me out, boys.
[173:52.70]Oh, it's over for me.
[173:55.60]We've learned.
[173:56.24]We're working together now.
[173:58.34]Sounds like you're in the middle of a really great stretch.
[174:03.86]I'm getting my backside pushed in by you three.
[174:15.73]Not to stress you out.
[174:17.49]You guys saying betray someone now?
[174:20.57]I am in no position for betrayal.
[174:23.97]I don't own any territory.
[174:26.30]I own no territory.
[174:27.56]I have to sit this out for a while.
[174:32.63]And I'm going to make the, I'm going to, I'm going to make Charlie and Connor.
[174:36.29]I'm going to be like, yeah, I don't know, man.
[174:38.01]I don't know any territory.
[174:39.15]So I'm not the one to use to attack.
[174:41.15]And I know.
[174:44.42]Oh, God damn it.
[174:46.68]Charlie.
[174:48.10]Whoa.
[174:48.84]Why did you get 10 troops?
[174:49.90]Oh, you have all the bottom, right?
[174:51.60]I'm a gamer I wasn't gonna say anything about it I thought that that timer sound I thought ludwig was you like really excited hitting your knee on your desk this is just because like he messed up there no no I just thought the whole time you were like like using your knee like to hit because your discord indicator would pop up and I thought that was you making that sound yeah yeah
[175:19.54]Like I thought he was going like, like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap under his desk.
[175:23.82]Like really like excited.
[175:24.72]There it is.
[175:28.72]Brave.
[175:29.72]The loading dock.
[175:31.46]The blitz incident.
[175:33.91]We'll always remember the blitz incident boys.
[175:35.77]Yeah.
[175:36.17]I mean, I'll roll over here for you.
[175:38.63]All right.
[175:44.21]The order didn't make it down to the troops, unfortunately.
[175:50.14]Yeah, yeah.
[175:51.86]Oh, well.
[175:54.66]That's huge.
[175:55.98]That's huge.
[175:57.74]I don't know.
[176:05.96]Do this, I guess.
[176:06.72]Move one of those guys.
[176:12.14]I don't have enough for that.
[176:13.64]Okay.
[176:14.98]Ludwig intercepted the letter along the way.
[176:18.95]What I can do here is, Charlie, I can weaken it by... Oh, yeah.
[176:25.47]Good idea.
[176:29.19]So then you'd be able to easily take it by.
[176:33.78]And then I would kind of settle up at Cristini.
[176:38.04]Cristini.
[176:38.40]Cristini.
[176:40.25]okay yeah so that's a very tranquil space yeah so I'll do what I can here you guys are like adding letters oh excellent work it's a perfect fight my men didn't even hold a chance
[176:55.37]The warehouse holds, so don't even try.
[176:57.81]Okay.
[176:58.03]They also fell immediately.
[176:59.47]All right, so now you can handle this potentially down here.
[177:04.29]I don't know what he's going to do with troops, but he can't put very many.
[177:07.59]Yeah, he's in a tough spot right now.
[177:09.67]I've got it pretty locked down, except for bottom left.
[177:12.62]We're a little weak down there.
[177:17.14]I'm going to just sit back here.
[177:22.58]All right.
[177:23.62]Let's do...
[177:26.27]do this first let's do this second let's I think this is important to do you're throwing your points in the trash yeah I mean I look I don't own territory they do I have to play nice for a while and then I'll settle up here build up some troops and then I can make a move I can't make a move right now
[177:52.46]You don't want a repeat of what happened down there at Filter Bay, Lud.
[177:55.48]I'm telling you right now.
[177:57.58]I'm agreeing with you.
[178:06.26]Those Filter Bay boys are built different.
[178:08.59]You might want to just avoid them entirely.
[178:11.91]Thanks, ResubZain.
[178:12.63]Uh-huh.
[178:23.46]It's not about the points it's about sending a message I think I just have to stop here.
[178:38.54]I don't think of the opportunity to keep going You think you're funny
[178:49.31]Somebody in chat said that.
[178:50.45]I was just reading.
[178:52.81]I am the actor.
[178:53.68]They were the writer.
[178:55.76]I'm you.
[178:57.22]That's Filter Bay.
[178:58.10]Yeah, this is a card.
[179:04.82]You can really make something happen here.
[179:07.70]Yeah, so maybe just lock down ebuy.
[179:12.27]So let's give like that.
[179:22.47]Wow, that's a lot.
[179:24.27]Take it from him.
[179:25.15]That is a lot.
[179:27.17]Kill him.
[179:28.95]You're a little too excited here.
[179:39.58]Charlie, check your DMs.
[179:41.68]DMs?
[179:42.68]You'd like to distract me?
[179:43.90]Is that what's going on?
[179:44.75]No, just see on your screen.
[179:45.55]There should be some there.
[179:47.51]Oh, a little alliance?
[179:48.71]He's trying to pull all the alliances back.
[179:50.19]You guys have been allied the last two games.
[179:51.89]You're allied the last two games.
[179:53.43]Check this out.
[179:54.09]You see that message?
[179:55.79]Oh, that was very positive.
[179:58.15]Where should I put the last troops?
[179:59.03]Where should I put the last troops?
[180:01.41]Oof.
[180:01.97]You're going to want to fort.
[180:04.35]Yeah, hold on.
[180:09.05]Um... I wouldn't... Don't listen to him.
[180:12.07]He's gonna... You guys are gonna have an alliance, and he's gonna build a bunch of troops, and then it's gonna be like, oh, look, Ludwig won again.
[180:17.59]He, like, conquered the whole entire place for, like, the fourth time in a row.
[180:22.46]I guess I have a question for you, Charlie.
[180:23.96]Have you been having fun?
[180:25.82]Oh, yeah.
[180:26.88]I mean, so does it seem that bad if Ludwig wins again?
[180:30.60]You know?
[180:31.00]Like... Well, Ludwig winning has been kind of fun.
[180:35.70]That's what I'm saying.
[180:36.97]If it's been fun...
[180:39.03]I have it a fun time.
[180:43.73]You know what?
[180:44.63]You seem and I like this is going to come off like a little aggressive, but you seem perfect for you by like that's your place.
[180:52.98]I don't even want to have a piece of it.
[180:56.66]He's he's switching up.
[180:58.28]It's trusting guys.
[180:59.42]So you are you careful now?
[181:02.30]Yeah, it was the bottom, right?
[181:03.72]I think I'm going to take top right.
[181:06.28]Bottom right gives six alone.
[181:10.08]Yeah, I think I'm going to take the top right here.
[181:11.62]Oof.
[181:17.57]Oof.
[181:18.79]Okay.
[181:20.47]This is actually really scary.
[181:22.85]I'm going to come across, guys.
[181:25.21]I'm going to be a nice guy about it, though.
[181:26.63]I'm being cordial to everybody I take from.
[181:29.56]I'm in some trouble.
[181:30.22]I have united all of you in one simple goal of vanquishing me, but...
[181:37.07]If I'm looking at the map right now, Charlie and Connor are just dwarfing you, Germo.
[181:42.78]Yeah, but that's okay.
[181:45.44]I'm getting a territory here next turn.
[181:47.00]Yeah, we're like pals.
[181:47.90]We're all cool about it.
[181:49.76]Yeah, I'm going to be going for Christine.
[181:53.64]Oh, he can't.
[181:54.92]Okay.
[181:55.62]Are you really getting that?
[181:56.81]I don't know if you're getting it.
[181:59.11]Best of luck, I guess.
[182:00.75]I mean, I don't hear any terms from you.
[182:05.33]I'm not saying any terms, because I don't feel like I'm the one who's gonna lose first.
[182:08.87]I think you are.
[182:10.53]Interesting.
[182:11.04]That's huge.
[182:11.44]I think you need to come to me in this spot.
[182:14.60]That's huge, yeah.
[182:16.22]Fucking huge, man.
[182:25.87]You have to have cards or something, right?
[182:32.90]Oof, eight troops.
[182:34.32]That's pretty big.
[182:36.20]That is pretty big.
[182:37.06]Alright, I, uh, I'm gonna grab, uh, Christianity.
[182:43.45]We all cool with that?
[182:46.33]We okay with that?
[182:47.41]It's Charlie, you gotta talk to him.
[182:49.65]Oh, I'm fine.
[182:50.29]Wait, what are you- I wasn't listening.
[182:51.39]What was that?
[182:51.95]I'm going for Christianity.
[182:53.70]He said he was gonna attack Christianity, and then he won.
[182:55.54]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182:56.56]Okay.
[182:58.91]You cool with him taking E-Buy?
[183:00.41]Not E-Buy, but... No, no.
[183:01.95]I'm just going for a Christina D. I was switching it up.
[183:04.51]I don't know.
[183:04.87]This guy's a little... Bit of a loose character.
[183:07.59]Okay.
[183:14.36]Oh, smooth.
[183:14.76]It is smooth.
[183:15.72]Beautiful.
[183:16.14]I'm very sorry.
[183:16.78]I did not want to do that, but... Trying to have some troops, you know?
[183:25.78]Hold on.
[183:26.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[183:29.07]I'm just making sure there wasn't any orange down here that I missed.
[183:34.61]I'm not looking.
[183:36.49]You were peeping.
[183:37.69]It's okay to peep.
[183:39.96]Alright, now I actually get some troops.
[183:48.60]Yeah, guys, this is where I just build troops.
[183:50.95]I put like 60 people here eventually just sleeping in the back.
[183:55.29]And then I've run over everybody in the last five minutes.
[183:57.67]I'm gonna have like a hundred troops on one spot.
[183:59.62]The fight on tank bay.
[184:01.90]Oh my god.
[184:03.02]They're all going to fight each other.
[184:04.12]I'm going to be sitting right here.
[184:05.62]It's a bad start.
[184:07.28]We trade one for one.
[184:08.82]Round two.
[184:09.20]Come on, Tank Bay.
[184:10.12]Tank Bay.
[184:10.82]Oh, let's go.
[184:11.80]Tank Bay.
[184:12.52]Tank Bay.
[184:13.56]They don't want to be back under your rule, man.
[184:15.42]Come on.
[184:16.16]Tank Bay.
[184:16.80]No!
[184:17.60]Yes.
[184:18.06]Oh, that's very bad.
[184:19.60]We went two here.
[184:20.18]Good.
[184:20.64]Damn it.
[184:20.98]Come on, Tank Bay.
[184:21.50]Two more.
[184:21.84]Two more.
[184:22.74]Damn!
[184:23.82]He's strong.
[184:24.68]He's strong.
[184:27.27]All right.
[184:27.73]All right.
[184:28.79]One more.
[184:29.17]Finish him off!
[184:29.95]Damn it!
[184:31.41]Huge.
[184:33.04]Alright.
[184:33.32]That's alright.
[184:33.88]They fought pretty well.
[184:34.76]They fought pretty well, honestly.
[184:40.89]You lost way too much there.
[184:41.77]You got nowhere to go.
[184:42.27]Yeah.
[184:44.81]You got nowhere to go.
[184:45.75]Don't worry about what's going on over here.
[184:47.09]I just want you to know.
[184:49.07]Next turn, I'm about to go sicko mode.
[184:53.62]Really?
[184:54.02]That scares me.
[184:54.82]I don't like him saying that.
[184:56.54]It's going to be crazy.
[184:57.38]Last time he said that, it was bad for us.
[185:02.61]It'll be like something taught in history books.
[185:04.03]It'll be like the sicko mode war.
[185:08.61]One of the quotes will be like, that was huge from a fallen commander.
[185:11.87]What are we going to do with this, the bottom one?
[185:15.57]This one here, this werelib?
[185:19.08]We have to, somebody's got to claim that.
[185:20.48]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[185:23.04]Those are points that are not being used.
[185:24.70]Big man, big man.
[185:29.51]Jerma, I'll cede it to you in exchange for an unbreakable alliance.
[185:33.78]Big man, you're not coming in.
[185:35.86]Just hold the borders.
[185:37.86]Yeah, no, no, I'm not coming in.
[185:43.04]But what if I was?
[185:45.16]I think it would be bad for you.
[185:46.99]But what if I... But what if I was?
[185:51.21]I would...
[185:52.59]Highly recommend.
[185:54.25]What does the not cringe alliance think?
[185:56.07]Do I crash in?
[185:57.07]Cringe alliance.
[186:00.45]Let's confer with the cringe alliance for a second.
[186:04.49]I think you could do it, but just be careful.
[186:08.19]It'd be crazy.
[186:08.67]It'd be a wild move.
[186:10.89]On his next turn, he might sweep down here and take out barbecue.
[186:16.40]He does have three cards combined.
[186:18.40]What do you want me to do, boys?
[186:20.76]You tell me.
[186:21.22]I think hold.
[186:22.74]Yeah, that's a good idea, Jerma.
[186:24.58]He wants you to hold.
[186:28.24]I actually kind of do sound like that.
[186:29.48]You're right.
[186:30.72]It's probably not this turn.
[186:32.51]I'm just going to hold for this one, actually.
[186:34.01]I think Jerma's right.
[186:35.87]Jerma actually speaking some facts today.
[186:38.39]Don't catch me out to the Dunkin' Donuts.
[186:42.55]Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.
[186:43.67]I haven't been to Dunkin' Donuts in like four years.
[186:45.59]All right.
[186:48.49]Hogging the airways here, Jerma.
[186:49.47]Come on, please.
[186:51.89]You want Alliance?
[186:55.69]Whoa, Connor seems a little hungry.
[186:57.27]No, no, I'm just taking the top right.
[186:59.63]That's what we all agreed on.
[187:01.13]What's that five doing down there?
[187:02.57]Are you attacking?
[187:03.41]I'm just going to protect my voters.
[187:04.83]The cringe alliance.
[187:06.03]I guess, yeah.
[187:06.83]It seems like you're attacking Riven today.
[187:08.27]Do I need to use these?
[187:09.37]Do I have to use my cards now?
[187:11.36]yellow could kind of get a little wacky on the top left or top right over there kind of crash into that back yep that backbone over at prison and I can't because then I will get absolutely demolished and back ranked by e-buy raid terror uh what oh I guess I have to do this I have to use these oh yeah yeah you get max five cards max five cards
[187:37.48]Oh my God, Connor, you have such a big attack coming up.
[187:39.40]I can feel it in my bones.
[187:40.54]Holy shit.
[187:41.00]It's okay.
[187:41.22]It's okay.
[187:41.62]I'm not... Listen, we're all guys.
[187:43.16]We're all boys.
[187:44.25]We're just keeping it together here.
[187:46.95]Just some fortifications.
[187:48.11]A couple of guys fortifying.
[187:50.28]A lot of fortifications almost.
[187:52.68]Connor looks, by the way, impenetrable right now.
[187:57.80]Don't let this snake influence you.
[188:01.11]Hey, I'm sitting here, and I'm seeing who's going to write the history books, and his name's Connor Reespans.
[188:07.05]Germination will be forgotten fast.
[188:10.77]Don't listen to him.
[188:11.67]Don't listen to him.
[188:12.35]Contributed tons to science and history and culture.
[188:15.97]You're not attacking here, Connor, are you?
[188:17.86]No, no, no, no.
[188:20.23]We're just keeping everybody.
[188:21.37]We're just hanging out.
[188:22.30]Everybody's friends.
[188:23.82]Everybody's pals.
[188:31.20]Yeah, don't be fooled by this nonsense.
[188:32.97]He's got 16 troops.
[188:36.63]That's more than I have.
[188:37.45]There we go.
[188:41.97]Nobody bumping their legs, eh?
[188:50.60]Okay.
[188:52.88]I think somebody has to take this bottom one.
[188:55.34]Are we okay that I can, uh, taking, um... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[188:58.34]Really?
[188:59.20]Really, B?
[188:59.52]Of course.
[189:00.46]Okay.
[189:02.17]Let's make sure that's confirmed before I go for it.
[189:03.63]Okay.
[189:16.61]Oh, shit.
[189:16.99]I did this wrong.
[189:22.14]Oh, I lost a lot.
[189:23.90]Alright, I accidentally did not... It's okay.
[189:28.52]It's fine, it's fine.
[189:30.34]No, it's fine.
[189:45.61]It's a big, scary number.
[189:46.91]Twelve.
[189:48.37]Oof.
[189:49.41]Oh, my God.
[189:51.67]Whoa, whoa.
[189:54.31]Blitz!
[189:56.31]You don't want to come through filter bay.
[189:59.21]They don't like you there, Ludwig.
[190:00.47]They don't appreciate you.
[190:01.91]It's not going bad for me so far.
[190:03.11]I don't want to take this, though.
[190:18.12]No, DOS was not murdered.
[190:21.42]After this, I think this is the last game.
[190:22.77]I'm going to play some DOS after this.
[190:24.91]It's only 10 o'clock.
[190:25.55]It's not late.
[190:27.35]Where do I want to bring it to?
[190:30.51]I think I... I might have to...
[190:47.57]Where are you going?
[190:52.84]If you attack that, don't do it.
[190:55.24]I'm not even thinking about that, Connor.
[191:00.70]I think it's kind of fucked up we're doing the tri-lay right now.
[191:02.77]This is a little fucked up.
[191:04.57]I think it's a little messed up.
[191:05.97]Oh, shit.
[191:11.27]That car turning was ridiculous.
[191:13.51]None of us are liking that.
[191:14.51]We're all like allies.
[191:17.43]Are you fucking kidding me?
[191:19.83]I made that mistake before.
[191:21.30]Oh, it still worked out for you?
[191:26.04]Very spread out, though.
[191:26.96]You could essentially do the same exact thing that he just did.
[191:42.51]Huh?
[191:43.65]Yeah.
[191:43.85]We could do the same exact thing.
[191:45.65]I could just march through your back line.
[191:48.06]Yeah.
[191:48.48]No, I'm seeding Elo Juan.
[191:51.94]Oh, yeah.
[191:52.94]Okay.
[191:55.44]I have moved to the bottom left.
[191:57.16]I feel uncomfortable in seeding Elo Juan.
[191:59.60]I think you guys have done a bad job of controlling Connor, and I think his top right control...
[192:04.82]Somebody said the psycho play is to immediately right now turn and take this right side from Charlie.
[192:10.45]Oh, that's a bad idea.
[192:13.19]Charlie then immediately gets these.
[192:16.29]I mean, he's got 24 troops over here.
[192:17.81]I'm toast.
[192:19.47]I need to wait another few turns before I make any decisions.
[192:22.81]I want you to know that.
[192:24.57]That's fine.
[192:25.63]I still I need this, though.
[192:31.33]I'm marching.
[192:31.97]I'm marching.
[192:32.63]That's all you.
[192:37.42]Oh, this is good for me.
[192:38.10]Your troops are going to be spread here.
[192:39.16]You're going to have like three in A, B, and C. Oh, it's going to be ugly.
[192:49.61]How do I stop that from happening?
[192:51.52]You can't.
[192:52.04]You got to have at least three when you leave a territory.
[192:54.00]It's weird.
[192:55.44]You can't do just one after you get something.
[192:57.90]Unless you bring them all with you.
[193:01.02]This DM Connor.
[193:03.52]That's super weird.
[193:05.18]Yeah, I think it is intentional.
[193:07.74]There can be no betrayal until Ludwig is gone.
[193:10.84]Don't you understand?
[193:11.38]Because if I betray Charlie right now, Ludwig's still there.
[193:15.25]And Ludwig's going to be like, Oh!
[193:18.93]See what happened?
[193:19.69]You see what happened?
[193:20.55]He'll scream and then the two of them will kill me and Connor.
[193:24.75]I'm telling you right now, that's exactly how it's going to play out.
[193:26.65]That's exactly what will happen.
[193:31.30]I have to be careful.
[193:39.48]Oh, back-to-back hard.
[193:42.25]Wow.
[193:42.81]He's rolling like a god.
[193:44.09]Oh, Connor, I think you can take him out here.
[193:45.85]That's what I'm thinking, man.
[193:46.75]That's what I'm thinking.
[193:48.11]Oh, shit.
[193:49.17]I'm thinking.
[193:50.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[193:52.19]That's what I'm thinking.
[193:52.97]I think we closed this one out from him.
[193:54.95]I think you're closing this one out as a whole, Connor, to be clear.
[193:58.51]Oh, my God.
[193:59.58]I think Connor runs rampant.
[194:01.30]We're going to keep the march going.
[194:03.02]It's a GG situation for all of us here.
[194:05.42]I want you guys to know.
[194:06.82]No, no.
[194:07.96]Woah, woah, what the fuck just happened?
[194:11.16]Woah, I don't know, I just- People at BBQ were not happy about Team Point Bears.
[194:16.55]Holy shit!
[194:17.83]They were liking the new rules.
[194:18.75]We don't like blue in BBQ!
[194:20.01]That's what we say, it's a phrase.
[194:22.19]They do say that.
[194:23.17]Oh my god, you lost.
[194:24.21]Oh, you made a mistake.
[194:25.19]You skipped silo B. It's a blunder!
[194:29.26]This is stupid.
[194:30.34]He skipped silo B, what an error.
[194:32.46]It doesn't make any sense.
[194:34.42]Wait, no, I didn't.
[194:35.60]Oh, no.
[194:36.10]Well, no, because you have to go back, and now you have to leave three troops because you went back.
[194:39.48]I think you're still okay, though.
[194:43.12]No, it's over.
[194:43.89]You're not getting all of me.
[194:45.11]I want you to know you've left me alive, which will be your downfall.
[194:49.47]That's all right.
[194:50.21]At least I kept my allies alive.
[194:53.87]Damn, that fight over there at barbecue was one for the history books.
[194:58.57]Inspirational, huh?
[195:00.37]How about that?
[195:01.43]They fought hard.
[195:02.09]They really did.
[195:02.80]A lot of men died.
[195:03.68]A lot of good men.
[195:09.13]Well, when you think about it, at the end of the day, there's no country for it.
[195:14.83]Oh, there's a timer, isn't there?
[195:16.52]Oh.
[195:18.60]Wow.
[195:19.78]It's right through bay for you.
[195:21.44]Not even close.
[195:23.78]Oh, I ran out of time.
[195:27.19]Okay.
[195:31.33]German, can I make a deal with you?
[195:34.41]It depends.
[195:36.61]Hear me out first.
[195:37.95]I'm getting to that stage where Ludwig is pretty much on the ropes.
[195:42.71]He's got really nothing here.
[195:44.39]He's got this little bit.
[195:45.99]It's pretty desperate.
[195:47.55]He has one card, so he's got nothing.
[195:50.23]One of you guys will take that card.
[195:53.42]He's got nothing, Jerma.
[195:54.51]He's got nothing.
[195:55.25]Essentially, what I'm going to have to say is I'll just... I'll take these two down here.
[196:00.15]I'll take Whirlybee now.
[196:02.67]You guys can finish.
[196:04.59]One of you will finish him off and get his one card.
[196:07.41]I will chill here in the middle until we find out our next course of action, which we'll figure that out when we get there.
[196:14.72]Okay, I like that.
[196:17.36]I don't.
[196:18.44]Can I chime in?
[196:19.16]I don't like that.
[196:20.10]So what would you suggest?
[196:22.42]I would suggest you not only get yourself a little bit of Whirlybee, invade also Revan and Ondar.
[196:32.16]Weaken them all.
[196:32.86]All right?
[196:33.28]This is your time to dominate.
[196:36.26]Just get one on each.
[196:38.10]They don't need the bonus.
[196:40.73]You're running out of daylight, by the way.
[196:42.03]You got to roll.
[196:42.45]Oh!
[196:46.01]Jeremy, you gotta take that port and probably just two there.
[196:50.51]We'll just give that to you.
[196:51.69]Yeah, I'll take that for now.
[196:52.91]I'll take that for now.
[196:57.01]I was relocating your troops.
[196:58.05]I bought a one city beer yesterday.
[197:00.96]Whoa!
[197:05.00]Ayo!
[197:07.02]What's he doing?
[197:14.28]I gotta make a move, man.
[197:15.18]Gotta make a move in war.
[197:16.06]He's making a move.
[197:16.82]He's making a crazy move.
[197:19.72]All right.
[197:20.40]All right.
[197:21.06]All right.
[197:25.52]Big man.
[197:30.47]You want some of that land bag, Lloyd?
[197:31.79]I mean... Okay.
[197:35.83]Big man.
[197:37.81]Charlie.
[197:38.15]I don't know where he is.
[197:41.94]Charlie!
[197:42.28]He's quiet.
[197:43.94]No, did he go to the bathroom?
[197:47.80]He didn't see any of that.
[197:50.28]Okay, nobody say anything.
[197:51.33]Don't say anything.
[197:52.05]Just tell him, I'm gonna tell him my cat walked across the keyboard.
[197:54.17]Big man, big man, I need to arrange an alliance with you.
[197:57.41]Oh, what the fuck just happened?
[197:58.71]Jerma invaded your land and is threatening to take the rest of it.
[198:02.11]I need safe harbor.
[198:04.42]Can you provide me with safe harbor?
[198:07.40]Why did Jerma attack me?
[198:08.66]He literally just attacked you.
[198:10.72]Because Connor is dominating and he wants to win.
[198:14.26]He's actually a snake.
[198:15.84]I'm asking you, will you provide me safe harbor?
[198:18.68]He's whispering lies.
[198:20.42]I'm asking for just one.
[198:23.53]Charlie, I had to attack here because his plan is he's going to try to wrap around to try to kill.
[198:30.97]You had a one here where my eight is right now.
[198:35.73]I needed to fortify this section in the top left because he has six.
[198:38.35]He's going to come through.
[198:39.73]You're worried about my six!
[198:42.21]My six!
[198:43.29]Charlie, here's the thing.
[198:44.45]I want to take prison junction and I want you to save me from demolition and misery.
[198:50.79]I went to tinkle.
[198:51.67]I didn't see what actually happened.
[198:53.11]I don't know what kind of diplomatic snakery was done here.
[198:57.17]Oh my god.
[198:57.91]Nothing on my end.
[198:58.85]Nothing on my end, I pray.
[199:00.83]Okay, you know what?
[199:01.76]Charlie, I am hiding.
[199:03.99]On block A. Still attacking, by the way.
[199:05.77]I told you this is what he was doing.
[199:06.67]I'm not attacking.
[199:07.31]I'm trying to find safe passage.
[199:09.21]Oh, fuck.
[199:11.69]You can choose to stomp me out like a goddamn piece of meat.
[199:17.23]Ty, look, he's blocking your troop movements, man.
[199:19.83]No, I'm not.
[199:20.29]I'm block A. I'm block A. Block A doesn't block anything.
[199:22.47]That's the thing about block A. He can't get his 12 up to the top left.
[199:24.89]He can't get him over there.
[199:28.15]Charlie, you are on threat of extinction right now.
[199:30.34]I don't know what to do.
[199:31.56]I am not going to attack anymore.
[199:35.02]The whole purpose was to get here to make it so you couldn't go over here because there was one troop here.
[199:39.20]I'm coming up into... Take back E-Buy.
[199:42.32]Exactly.
[199:42.66]Take back E-Buy.
[199:43.42]Take it back.
[199:43.92]Take it back E-Buy.
[199:45.64]I will get out of E-Buy.
[199:47.08]I mean, 39 troops is a lot.
[199:48.46]Don't stop at E-Buy.
[199:49.86]All right?
[199:50.28]You can take a little bit of Cristinini.
[199:52.32]I'm thinking.
[199:52.86]I'm thinking.
[199:54.37]I think you have to invade a bit of Cristinini.
[199:57.17]He's a madman.
[199:58.73]You could also go south too.
[199:59.83]A little bit of south action wouldn't hurt you.
[200:02.65]Fighting that eight would be bad because that's a lot to lose potentially.
[200:06.05]I fought eight one time in barbecue and it was a mistake.
[200:08.60]You win this eight.
[200:09.58]You win.
[200:10.72]You sure do, but you also get two cards if you get rid of Ludwig right now.
[200:17.70]But remember the Alamo.
[200:22.14]I know what I need to do.
[200:23.88]Don't forget what happened in Mexico.
[200:25.22]He's making a huge play here.
[200:26.74]I know what I have to do.
[200:28.39]You're running out of time.
[200:29.23]You're running out of daylight.
[200:30.01]You got to Getty Byland before the end of this turn.
[200:34.62]Holy, holy shit, man.
[200:35.70]That was huge.
[200:37.24]You also should invade Whirlybee.
[200:38.92]You shouldn't kill me.
[200:40.02]You have to Getty Byland.
[200:41.30]I have to.
[200:42.30]No.
[200:42.48]It's not going to save you.
[200:44.04]Charlie, no.
[200:44.91]It's a crazy fight.
[200:45.71]No.
[200:46.57]Huge.
[200:47.59]Yes.
[200:47.77]That was huge.
[200:49.03]I can't believe that just.
[200:50.23]Oh, no.
[200:51.15]Oh, huge.
[200:51.81]Remember.
[200:55.02]That's huge fucking huge fucking huge Oh my god, he's gonna say huge huge What is the fucking huge that thing I keep hearing is it this is bad for you Jerry?
[201:13.26]It's not a huge for you
[201:15.17]This is fucking huge.
[201:17.37]When you cross the filter bay, boys.
[201:19.87]Huge, huge.
[201:21.65]Oh, my God.
[201:24.47]Connor is going to run over some cities.
[201:27.25]Connor is going to take over all of Charlie's board at this point.
[201:30.66]No, you have to finish Ludd off first.
[201:33.22]I equalized it.
[201:37.22]Connor, you should go from the south and just chew through.
[201:41.42]Block A is scary Connor, be careful.
[202:02.06]All right.
[202:02.70]Go for block A last.
[202:03.64]It'd be honorable.
[202:04.20]They're weak.
[202:04.60]They're scared.
[202:05.44]I don't know how I got here, but I'm in this Discord call, and I don't know how I got in here.
[202:10.09]I don't know how I got here, but I'm in this Discord call, and I don't know how I got in here.
[202:13.87]You guys were so worried about me being the big monster.
[202:16.63]Why won't this go lower?
[202:17.71]See, now we're in a weird situation.
[202:18.89]I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but I had so many help, I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[202:25.59]I don't know how I got in this Discord call, but I had so many help, I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[202:31.79]Did you click spectate?
[202:32.49]It's on the bottom left.
[202:33.27]No, I clicked the goddamn arrow.
[202:35.19]I don't know how I got this Discord call, but I had somebody help.
[202:38.93]I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[202:40.63]Who the fuck is that?
[202:45.40]Yeah, I'm trying to find it.
[202:48.88]Who's talking right now?
[202:49.90]Who's talking?
[202:50.70]Why is it not on the thing?
[202:52.10]Someone typed in chat, Jerma's worst joke coming up.
[202:59.03]I already did it.
[203:00.17]And it was the worst joke because nobody reacted to it.
[203:02.83]Oh, you're wasting my turn.
[203:06.46]Oh, yes.
[203:07.54]Wait.
[203:07.80]Hold on.
[203:08.82]That's Ludwig in my head.
[203:09.56]He's wasting my turn.
[203:10.58]Who's screen sharing me?
[203:12.43]I need one screen share.
[203:13.99]He was trying to bait me, man.
[203:16.51]Can anybody hear me?
[203:19.66]Charlie?
[203:19.94]Yep.
[203:20.42]What?
[203:21.48]Can you screen share me?
[203:22.70]No, I didn't screen share you.
[203:23.74]I don't know how I got- Wait, no, you said, can I?
[203:25.40]Somebody help, I got the wrong- No, it's gonna definitely flicker my game, I already know it.
[203:29.08]Connor?
[203:29.98]No, you baited me.
[203:31.34]What do you- I just need- I'm out of the game!
[203:33.22]What do you want from me?!
[203:34.28]I can't bait you!
[203:37.02]It won't let me screen share the game, it's not an application.
[203:41.61]guys I think I got in the wrong discord call I don't know how I got here I got the wrong server id I don't know what's happening if somebody can troubleshoot with me share your screen guys I think I got in the wrong discord call I don't know how I got in here I got the wrong server id I don't know what's happening if somebody can troubleshoot with me do the whole thing share the whole thing don't be shy oh yeah are you oh you screen sharing yeah okay
[204:05.32]I'm going to have to go, I think.
[204:07.28]Guys, I think I got the wrong Discord call.
[204:09.34]I don't know how I got in here.
[204:10.26]I got the wrong server ID.
[204:11.26]I don't know what's happening.
[204:12.00]If somebody can troubleshoot with me, I think I have to go up here.
[204:14.18]Who is that guy?
[204:16.19]What a weird guy.
[204:16.93]This guy's weird.
[204:18.61]A lunatic.
[204:19.17]Was that somebody in the call?
[204:19.93]Who was that?
[204:21.33]Sounds like an absolute loony for sure.
[204:35.76]Oh, we didn't even put up a fight.
[204:37.26]I didn't have time to strategize last time.
[204:38.92]I was too busy trying to figure out a screen share.
[204:43.30]Oh, my God.
[204:43.82]We're not even fighting anymore.
[204:45.02]This can't be anything except for a gun.
[204:50.83]What happened, right?
[204:52.01]I thought Charlie was going to be... It was going to be me and him.
[204:55.53]Jerm is having a crazy rally right now.
[204:58.83]Charlie lost almost all his army trying to kill me.
[205:01.44]That's true.
[205:02.04]I did.
[205:02.36]You made a mistake.
[205:06.86]I think I gotta stay like this.
[205:08.04]I don't think I can do anything else.
[205:08.96]Who is this guy?
[205:11.02]Oh shit!
[205:11.90]I didn't know it was still on!
[205:13.66]It's been on for hours now.
[205:17.17]I forgot your old voice.
[205:26.68]Connor's troop count is outrageous.
[205:28.34]I mean, the good thing is he thoroughly messed up trying to kill me off.
[205:34.33]Charlie, I think your best bet here is to... That's so embarrassing because...
[205:38.21]I don't think you can beat me.
[205:40.09]I don't think you can fight those.
[205:41.63]Really?
[205:42.39]Like, I was just talking like that?
[205:44.07]I don't think so either.
[205:44.95]I think if you protect the byland, specifically the bottom left of the byland, that's your best bet.
[205:51.89]It's supposed to be like a guy is just talking and I'm talking normally.
[205:55.75]You know what I'm saying?
[205:57.03]No, because you can band together and fight.
[206:00.45]Does German want to attack you because he knows you are his ticket to winning?
[206:03.58]What the fuck have I done?
[206:04.56]I don't know.
[206:05.96]I don't know.
[206:08.11]I mean look I've got I got five cards yeah he could he could pull out something crazy he has to cash out 20 troops next turn and if I'm telling you whoever wants to come for me I think if you go bottom left to be my land that's square next to the boat here's the thing I've seen me throw these before like I wouldn't say this game's done
[206:34.75]Everyone's making good points.
[206:36.25]I'm not listening to him.
[206:37.23]Let's ride.
[206:39.79]Madness.
[206:41.66]I'm actually embarrassed for you.
[206:44.28]It was an error.
[206:45.84]God damn it.
[206:47.32]Go to the right.
[206:47.84]Right side.
[206:48.16]He's more greed than man.
[206:48.80]Alright.
[206:49.08]Alright.
[206:49.98]Alright.
[207:03.31]stretched thin like a pizza I take everything with me I would be careful though this is coming up there germa's actually jerma could die connor could kill jerma connor could win this turn actually you have a lot of faith in me no no because you also have the cards in the bottom left connor oh I do
[207:32.80]I should not have told you that.
[207:34.88]They were placating me so bad, too.
[207:37.38]Like, oh, who's that weird guy?
[207:38.88]What will kill you is your indecisiveness.
[207:40.70]I had no idea.
[207:41.71]That's true.
[207:42.19]Oh, my God.
[207:47.85]25 troops, wow.
[207:49.53]That's a lot of troops.
[207:50.67]That'll never be enough to break us.
[207:55.21]I mean, it is enough.
[207:56.68]I just don't think he's quick enough to break you.
[207:58.70]That's another great point.
[207:59.76]Let's just laugh, I guess.
[208:00.88]I mean, I don't know.
[208:02.20]I guess we'll just kind of placate that he's doing this thing.
[208:04.22]We're trying to put troops down, but, you know, whatever.
[208:07.78]It would be sad if Jerma dies before being able to cash in those cards.
[208:10.38]I'm just taking up here, you know?
[208:14.11]I mean, if you do, you're going to get five cards, which is a guarantee.
[208:18.79]Whoever kills me, gets the last hit, is guaranteed to win the game.
[208:23.50]Yeah, because you immediately get to re-up.
[208:25.82]You get to re-pop for another 30 troops, probably.
[208:31.58]Just keep it moving.
[208:33.08]Yeah, you're going to have to go all the way here.
[208:34.80]Keep the guys going.
[208:35.72]Here we go.
[208:44.97]uh here we go these guys are gonna come over here speed that's the problem here we go all right guys we're just gonna keep moving around one bad blitz this is it that's it that's it I'm so sorry man
[209:01.29]You're a good ally.
[209:02.49]I think the new country that's the whole world, I think it's going to be really good for the people.
[209:06.75]I'm really glad that you got the cards, though, because we've had an alliance the whole time.
[209:12.14]Yeah, for sure.
[209:12.82]To be clear, you've all had an alliance the whole time to kill me.
[209:16.00]Yeah, it was pretty poetic.
[209:17.44]It was like in Code Geass where the world united against Lelouch.
[209:20.62]Yeah, it was actually like that, except it wasn't an honorable thing that I was doing.
[209:25.88]Oh, I see what's going on.
[209:28.08]It was more like a sad thing.
[209:29.54]Everyone hated me.
[209:31.35]It was like World War II.
[209:34.93]Timer's moving real quick.
[209:36.29]You're going to have to finish me now or never at all.
[209:39.92]I'm just clicking.
[209:42.70]Oh, we took 10.
[209:44.40]That was a huge win at Tech Plant.
[209:47.64]The problem is Connor doesn't care about his men.
[209:49.10]He'll throw them into harm's way.
[209:50.54]It's all right.
[209:51.04]They're fighting for the good of the Republic.
[209:53.81]I have three cards myself, actually.
[209:56.39]I hope they're correct and not like misaligned.
[209:59.11]No, they're not correct.
[210:01.73]Oh my god.
[210:03.89]Let me get over there.
[210:06.05]You don't have cards, do you, Charlie?
[210:08.09]He's got three.
[210:11.09]He left you.
[210:11.99]Oh my god.
[210:13.91]That could be bad.
[210:14.95]That could shift some things around.
[210:17.41]Oh my god.
[210:18.05]I don't know how I got in this discord.
[210:20.17]Somebody help.
[210:20.59]I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[210:25.85]I don't know where to put him.
[210:26.65]You okay, Bumper?
[210:33.24]Connor's cat can sense something's wrong.
[210:35.08]Yeah, he's pissed.
[210:38.70]I muted.
[210:39.30]I did that for you guys.
[210:40.58]We were saying speed is of the utmost importance.
[210:42.80]You are not showing that off today.
[210:44.84]Hold on.
[210:45.50]Hold on.
[210:49.10]I can't believe that just happened.
[210:51.08]Yikes!
[210:51.90]Did he lose a lot?
[210:53.06]He lost about like 15 men to one troop.
[210:56.02]They fought hard there, man.
[210:57.58]They love their country.
[210:58.80]Ghost of Keeve.
[210:59.46]I'm biting my lip so hard.
[211:04.39]You're not going through this, are you?
[211:06.13]You got to stop.
[211:06.89]You got to stop.
[211:07.61]No, no, no, no.
[211:08.37]I'm just taking this boat.
[211:10.41]Why would you take the boat?
[211:11.61]Oh, you left yourself open.
[211:12.91]Oh, no.
[211:13.59]Oh, don't.
[211:14.35]No, no, no, no.
[211:15.27]He's playing like me.
[211:18.33]A little foolishly and ghoulishly, you're correct.
[211:21.31]We're fine.
[211:23.03]The problem is you have one card and Connor has four.
[211:28.49]My biggest concern is invading and then somehow misaligning the invasion to where there's just a hole.
[211:34.90]Yeah, like those 15 troops you can't access in Christmas Eve.
[211:37.68]I'm going to get you guys banned from everybody's channel.
[211:40.46]I like our odds here.
[211:41.36]What are you doing?
[211:42.08]Don't be fucking weirdos.
[211:49.04]I don't even know what I do.
[211:51.10]You'll- you'll never find us.
[211:53.00]I've spread us all over the continent.
[211:55.36]It's gonna take- one of you guys just has to go and do it in one shot.
[211:58.56]That's the only way it's gonna work.
[211:59.83]I think, yeah.
[212:00.65]That's the only way.
[212:01.47]Oh!
[212:02.97]Bumper!
[212:04.07]I still can't believe what happened over there at fucking barbecue.
[212:07.61]Oh yeah, you could edit that 15.
[212:20.04]There.
[212:21.18]You got to do it in one go.
[212:24.34]Where did I put everybody?
[212:25.14]There we go.
[212:25.40]You'll never get me in one go.
[212:26.60]I actually agree.
[212:29.00]Did you troubleshoot that guy's Discord?
[212:30.54]I mean, we tried.
[212:31.49]We're fighting so hard.
[212:32.79]Yes.
[212:33.41]They took three.
[212:33.93]They took three.
[212:34.99]Three for one.
[212:36.87]The whole camera just glitched.
[212:38.95]47.
[212:39.53]It's actually attacking me.
[212:40.65]The whole game doesn't want to see me win.
[212:43.65]No.
[212:43.73]They're rolling you right now, Charlie.
[212:45.53]Filter Bay is going to stand strong.
[212:47.15]They always do.
[212:49.43]Carrier aft seems like a good spot.
[212:53.29]Shit.
[212:55.38]He's not winning this turn.
[212:57.30]He can't.
[212:57.64]There's no way.
[212:58.20]There's no way.
[212:58.94]Not with Filter Bay.
[213:00.04]There's no way.
[213:01.48]Oh, and he leaves five in landing for no reason.
[213:04.20]Because I don't know how this game works.
[213:08.49]There we go.
[213:10.05]Strategically avoiding Filter Bay.
[213:11.61]Oh, my God, dude.
[213:13.43]What the heck happened?
[213:16.35]I can't even attack that one.
[213:20.13]Oh my god.
[213:22.91]He found his 47 troops.
[213:28.96]Oh my god, dude.
[213:31.20]What the heck?
[213:32.80]You're gonna regret this.
[213:34.82]There's a lot of people just spread out.
[213:37.01]You do have like five men per island.
[213:39.29]Oh my god, dude.
[213:40.77]What the heck happened?
[213:41.83]Dude, I think you're in the wrong Discord.
[213:44.74]Oh my god.
[213:45.96]Oh my god.
[213:46.96]Oh my god, dude.
[213:48.44]What the heck happened?
[213:50.78]Man, filter bays lost the will.
[213:52.85]Jesus Christ.
[213:54.79]They're so tired of fighting at this point.
[213:57.35]They have only known war.
[213:59.25]Way too many leadership changes.
[214:01.45]I'm not doing it again, I promise.
[214:02.79]You live one more turn here, Charlie.
[214:05.01]Yep, and I'm going to make the most of it.
[214:07.05]I got three troops, and I'm getting the fuck out.
[214:12.01]Wait, I think I can win this.
[214:13.75]If you just snake around and wait till you get a card turn in, he might not be able to catch you.
[214:18.44]Yeah, I think that's the play.
[214:19.86]Yeah.
[214:21.86]I think I'll go for that.
[214:23.80]He just has so many troops.
[214:29.70]And they're all over.
[214:31.65]They are.
[214:32.29]You know what?
[214:32.83]You're right.
[214:37.08]Somebody said wrong discord dude.
[214:41.10]Haha That might shift things I'm not pressing the button to do that again, so I'm just letting you know I promise it's done No, I know you yeah Ludwig you saying that cuz you're like he's that's gonna get him going he's gonna press the sound I forgot to attack that one now me I
[215:05.42]42 troops.
[215:06.80]It's not enough.
[215:09.78]A lot of guys there.
[215:10.92]Feels like it's enough, Charlie.
[215:13.36]Watch.
[215:13.96]I've strategically positioned us on the optimal battlefield.
[215:19.87]You know what?
[215:20.51]I think he didn't do enough here.
[215:21.83]I think industrial cargo lives.
[215:25.53]18's not enough.
[215:26.75]Oh, he messed up!
[215:28.13]This game is so... Wrong Discord.
[215:33.66]How did he make any fucking sense?
[215:35.86]Hey, dude, I got into your call.
[215:38.62]Like, what are you talking about?
[215:40.92]How are you supposed to possibly do that?
[215:43.42]Oh, you fool.
[215:44.12]You'll never beat us here.
[215:46.24]Another mistake.
[215:47.75]Challenge us anyway on the disposal cargo.
[215:52.56]Alright.
[215:52.92]I need these guys to die.
[215:54.55]Oh my god.
[215:55.89]Wait.
[215:56.39]This is so dumb.
[215:57.19]Why can't I move them?
[215:58.85]Oh, Charlie.
[215:59.73]Charlie, you could make it to a card turn.
[216:02.09]Guys, I'm so close to it.
[216:05.66]Alright.
[216:06.00]Oh, he's figured out how to fortify.
[216:07.86]Wait, that's it?
[216:10.22]I can't move other guys?
[216:13.64]We're making a run for it.
[216:16.36]I'm going to try and take refuge.
[216:17.96]In the middle of this embarrassing joke arc here, somebody goes, hey, dude, you playing Stanley Parable Deluxe?
[216:23.84]Your boys are lacking resolve.
[216:25.76]Yeah.
[216:26.32]Good, good, good.
[216:29.17]They believe in you, man.
[216:30.89]They believe.
[216:34.97]You'll get a card.
[216:39.83]All right.
[216:40.87]I just need disposal cargo to hang strong, and that's all.
[216:45.74]If they beat the 15, which is possible.
[216:50.66]Oh, disposal cargo, we need you now.
[216:52.88]Oh, forgot to intern.
[216:55.97]Connor's gonna get like 40 troops though.
[216:58.89]30.
[216:59.05]Oh my god.
[216:59.85]Not good enough.
[217:00.89]I give them like... I'll say that.
[217:04.31]Ooh, mistake.
[217:05.45]Underestimating.
[217:06.35]I'm fine.
[217:07.31]Underestimating, Connor.
[217:08.51]It's okay.
[217:08.79]I believe in these guys.
[217:10.07]Oh, you think disposal cargo with anything less than 50?
[217:12.55]I believe... Listen, there's a lot of resolve on the blue side.
[217:18.39]Oh, Cristinini lives!
[217:20.47]Oh, it's one and done every time.
[217:22.31]Oh, we did it.
[217:24.33]We did it.
[217:25.11]Alright, it's all up to disposal, Cargo.
[217:26.93]Alright.
[217:27.29]Can this happen, boys?
[217:28.55]This is the fight here.
[217:29.61]These are the, these are like sport.
[217:32.43]Oh!
[217:32.57]They did take ten.
[217:33.92]Yeah, they fought.
[217:34.60]They fought.
[217:35.50]Good game.
[217:35.92]Valiant.
[217:36.42]Valiant.
[217:36.96]It's because they fought the alien guy.
[217:39.70]Yeah, pay to win, I guess, huh?
[217:41.84]Yeah, I suppose so.
[217:43.18]I mean, the dice was weighted.
[217:46.42]All right, well, GG, gamers.
[217:49.20]You all did valiantly, destroying me.
[217:53.10]Really just dismantling me as a human.
[217:55.30]Kind of had to, though.
[217:55.92]We had to.
[217:57.42]You can't win three or four in a row.
[217:59.09]You know, it's fair.
[218:00.11]It's fair.
[218:00.83]I got a token!
[218:02.63]Nice.
[218:04.41]That's the worst part about this.
[218:05.61]I haven't gotten a single token.
[218:08.49]Alright, gamers.
[218:12.65]I gotta head out.
[218:14.08]I gotta go too.
[218:15.18]That was fun, boys.
[218:15.92]Take it easy, everyone.
[218:17.04]Thanks for the games.
[218:17.74]That was a lot of fun.
[218:20.30]See you later, guys.
[218:20.96]We'll see you guys later.
[218:27.84]Oh, wrong Discord.
[218:28.78]Is there somebody over here?
[218:32.03]He's like, all right, dad.
[218:32.95]That's like dad.
[218:36.90]Dad makes that joke.
[218:37.94]You know what I mean?
[218:38.42]Like, oh, hey, fellas.
[218:40.00]I know you're having a pretty good World of Warcraft sesh, but how do I get in here?
[218:45.32]And then I have to go.
[218:46.76]I'll be like that.
[218:47.46]Dad.
[218:49.36]And I have to get up and be like, don't embarrass me in front of my fucking friends.
[218:56.77]And then dad's like, what?
[218:59.75]I was funny, what?
[219:02.33]I actually am like dad.
[219:13.04]Dad, that's not funny at all.
[219:19.46]20 minutes of DOS incoming, Pog.
[219:20.96]Alright, what do you guys want to do?
[219:22.82]What do you guys think?
[219:24.76]Here's the plan.
[219:26.26]Plan A. Plan A.
[219:30.52]I'm not high.
[219:31.56]I don't get high on stream.
[219:32.60]I haven't got high on stream in like a year and a half.
[219:35.78]We... Okay.
[219:38.40]We do DOS right now for like a couple hours, two or three hours.
[219:43.53]Or we come back tomorrow, do DOS tomorrow at a normal time.
[219:48.85]What do you think?
[220:00.20]Can we get a poll?
[220:02.98]I will be playing DOS longer tomorrow.
[220:06.56]Or we can go hard tonight and I stream till like 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.
[220:13.16]Then that means there is no stream tomorrow.
[220:15.90]If I stream till like 2, 3 a.m.
[220:17.49]Pacific, I'm not going to stream tomorrow.
[220:21.65]Tomorrow is better.
[220:22.39]I've seen a lot of tomorrows.
[220:29.13]Do both.
[220:38.81]Normal time, by the way, would be 4 o'clock Pacific.
[220:43.63]That was fun, though.
[220:46.91]I'm really enjoying the kind of just jump in a game with a bunch of just buds.
[220:52.13]That's fun.
[220:55.99]Connor raiding.
[220:59.77]A fellow ally.
[221:00.49]To the right.
[221:03.21]And I'm probably about to send you somewhere else.
[221:07.26]You're all about to go somewhere else.
[221:08.64]Because the poll looks like it's unanimous.
[221:13.58]That tomorrow is when I'm going to stream.
[221:19.99]Is Charlie still streaming?
[221:26.28]Yeah, we'll do it tomorrow.
[221:26.96]We'll just do it tomorrow at 4 o'clock.
[221:28.84]We'll do some DOS.
[221:35.91]Yeah, tomorrow's probably better anyways.
[221:37.43]Instead of keeping everybody up until 2 o'clock in the morning, we'll just start tomorrow at 4 Pacific.
[221:41.54]Yeah, that's better.
[221:42.16]That's the plan.
[221:47.51]Uh, yeah, thanks to the Raid Corner.
[221:50.05]Obviously a lot of fun to play with you.
[221:51.79]As always.
[221:53.11]So I'll just send you guys immediately here to... Is Ludwig still streaming too?
[221:57.33]We'll see you off for the night.
[222:09.34]Charlie's still on.
[222:12.10]Alright.
[222:13.43]We'll send you guys to Charlie.
[222:16.31]I'll see you guys later.
[222:17.51]Thanks for watching.
[222:18.22]See you tomorrow.
[222:21.20]Good night.
[222:22.78]Goodbye.
[222:25.88]That was Risk.
[222:27.66]I didn't play DOS.
[222:28.60]I know it says that in the tweet and potentially even in the title.
[222:35.64]If Ludwig's still streaming then some of you run over there.
[222:39.48]I will officially be slash raiding Charlie.
[222:47.13]Very, very fun.
[222:48.99]Didn't win, but you know, hey, I did okay, I think.
[222:52.29]It's more about the journey than it is about the destination.
[222:54.36]Come on.
[223:06.22]I got a lot of DOS games.
[223:07.58]A lot.
[223:12.07]One would say too many.
[223:13.21]So it's actually kind of good.
[223:17.48]It's good that we're not doing this tonight because I might stay up till like 3 a.m.
[223:25.71]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[223:27.75]Good night.
[223:28.23]Goodbye.
[223:28.99]Take care of yourselves.
[223:32.29]See you tomorrow.
[223:55.37]I don't know how I got in this discord call, but I had somebody help.
[224:09.21]I got the wrong server ID, I think.
[224:31.89]you
[225:06.76]you
