[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.73]hello good afternoon how are you I'm doing good I'm doing good I'm doing alright I need to address something very very quickly right off the bat at the very beginning of this stream
[00:31.78]I said a while back, a long time ago, that Sands would never be in Undertale, and I guaranteed it.
[00:44.58]So now I have to eat a shoe.
[00:49.10]I don't know what kind of shoe it has to be.
[00:50.76]I know that I said I was going to eat a full shoe on stream if Sands was confirmed, and
[00:59.88]He was last yesterday.
[01:03.31]I mean, Smash.
[01:12.69]Not Undertale.
[01:15.67]It's Smash Brothers, yeah.
[01:17.43]Oh, no, no.
[01:18.17]Sans is in Undertale.
[01:23.31]What a surprise that is.
[01:24.57]Yeah.
[01:28.83]And, I mean, like, crap.
[01:32.55]Hey, Jolo, thanks for the five community subs.
[01:37.33]Eat a Jordan?
[01:40.49]Yeah, someone will find a clip of me saying, I will eat a shoe if... But thanks for the five subs.
[01:55.09]And so the shoe-eating stream will be on...
[02:00.10]Uh, March 12th, 2020, mark it on your calendar.
[02:13.60]I ain't gonna eat a fucking shoe on stream.
[02:17.48]Anyways, how you doing?
[02:18.25]Uh, today, yeah, so Sans is from Undertale, is in Smash Bros.
[02:22.45]We actually talked about this last night.
[02:24.27]And, that's, okay, cool.
[02:25.71]That's really, I couldn't, I could never have imagined...
[02:29.42]Wow.
[02:30.14]Oh, that's pretty interesting.
[02:31.30]He is... Although, he's a Mii costume.
[02:35.59]So... I think that means I only have to eat 50% of the shoe.
[02:38.97]You know what I'm saying?
[02:46.05]I can cut it in half, right?
[02:58.10]You just eat a sock instead.
[03:02.87]No, I ain't eating any clothes.
[03:05.87]Imagine, like, I eat a fucking shoe.
[03:08.63]And I have to go to the doctor.
[03:12.43]What seems to be the trouble, Jeremy?
[03:14.85]Um... Well, you know Sans from Undertale, right?
[03:18.65]Oh, it's my favorite!
[03:22.58]Yeah.
[03:23.24]Let me guess.
[03:24.66]You bet that he wouldn't be in Smash.
[03:26.00]Me too!
[03:26.50]And he, like, shows an x-ray of his stomach, and he's got a shoe in there too.
[03:30.63]And I'm like, Doc, oh, damn, geez, what, are you serious?
[03:33.97]He's like, I know, right?
[03:35.25]And I'm like, why did you eat the whole shoe?
[03:37.33]And he looks at me and he's like, what do you mean?
[03:39.11]Why would he eat the whole shoe?
[03:40.27]He's a Mii costume.
[03:42.81]Oh, shit!
[03:43.53]And, like, then he holds up my x-ray, and I got a half a shoe in there.
[03:46.11]We both laugh.
[03:47.35]And then I make a lifelong friend.
[03:49.20]So I'm okay with that.
[03:58.09]Anyways, we're gonna do more Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
[04:01.01]This is the final.
[04:01.87]This is the finale.
[04:07.52]Is it gonna be the last stream of this game?
[04:08.84]Because we're probably gonna get to the end.
[04:10.82]Now, this stream of Mario might be... Like, I don't know.
[04:17.84]It might be three hours to finish this.
[04:19.40]It might be six.
[04:22.77]And you say, you're right, I do have another story for you.
[04:26.35]Another story.
[04:27.49]But I had a few dreams.
[04:29.97]And one of them is really, really weird.
[04:31.59]And I need some people in the chat to try to explain to me what the fuck this dream meant.
[04:36.33]Because it is outrageous, okay?
[04:40.66]So, I fall asleep.
[04:43.18]And my brain tends to do this thing when I go to bed.
[04:47.14]Where... If I wake up... Let's back up.
[04:51.70]I gotta back way the fuck up for this.
[04:54.30]If I go to sleep for more than three or four hours and wake up for some reason, whether it's I have to... I gotta pee or something, or like, oh, I just kind of rolled over or, you know, any reason, I will fall back asleep like six more times.
[05:11.90]Each one of those times that I fall back asleep, I'll wake up.
[05:14.82]Fall back asleep, I'll wake up.
[05:16.28]There is a new episode of Dream TV on.
[05:18.91]Every single time.
[05:21.57]Number one, why does that happen?
[05:30.18]It's just boom, boom, boom.
[05:31.92]New episode of TV.
[05:32.88]New episode.
[05:33.30]You're changing channels.
[05:34.04]Anyways.
[05:37.08]Anyways.
[05:39.20]The first dream was terrifying.
[05:41.82]It was fucking scary as all hell.
[05:44.34]So I'm in the backyard of some... I don't know where I was.
[05:47.47]Some friend's house.
[05:48.33]Somebody said... That kind of detail don't matter.
[05:51.51]There was a barbecue.
[05:54.23]It was me and friends and maybe his family.
[05:57.65]Cool, wow, we're in the backyard.
[05:59.24]It's grills going.
[06:01.12]And in the distance above, all the way up in the sky,
[06:06.84]Something was strange about the sky.
[06:09.02]I'm like, what's going on with the sky?
[06:10.79]You know when you just know in a dream that something bad is going to happen?
[06:15.97]Nothing happened yet.
[06:17.19]I'm just like looking at the sky.
[06:18.87]Oh, something's wrong up there.
[06:20.01]No, there's not.
[06:20.61]Why do you know that?
[06:21.47]Why is your brain giving you the spoiler before it happens?
[06:25.70]Anyways, about five to ten seconds later in my dream reality...
[06:30.47]giant fucking boulders were tiny tiny tiny in the sky like three four five six of them at a time and these things are rapidly falling towards Earth and I'm just like are those those are really far away but they're coming in real quick I baby I think I should probably run because those are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger if they were going like 600 000 miles per hour
[06:55.52]And I'm just, like, fucking, I start sprinting.
[06:58.96]Sprinting to my left.
[07:01.08]Boulder is flying down, just takes up the entire sky at this point, and, like, crash to my right.
[07:08.07]And I, like, just barely Super Mario'd out of the way.
[07:11.93]Two more, like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[07:13.67]Like, asteroid fucking raining hell.
[07:16.61]More of them come.
[07:17.55]I look up.
[07:18.26]I'm safe.
[07:19.04]No, I'm not.
[07:19.94]What the?
[07:20.52]Whoa, there's more.
[07:21.58]Like seven more are like starting to come into picture.
[07:24.76]I look forward.
[07:26.13]Otto is right in front of me.
[07:28.67]And I'm like, wait, Otto, Otto, Otto.
[07:31.77]And he starts running towards me.
[07:34.04]And I'm like, and I go to pick him up, and I scoop him up, and boom!
[07:39.26]Another asteroid lands right where I just picked him up, and I'm like, we just barely got away.
[07:42.72]I'm running around with Otto, like, this fucking asteroid's landing everywhere.
[07:45.72]I'm doing, like, all these jumps, like, double jumps and shit to get away from them.
[07:49.99]I ended up lying on my back with Otto, and...
[07:54.48]like a QTE cutscene scenario, where it's like, there's one, roll left, left.
[08:00.84]There's another one, roll right.
[08:02.35]Ow, my hand.
[08:03.47]There's another one, roll right.
[08:06.09]I'm doing QTEs looking at the sky.
[08:07.75]It was freaking me the fuck out.
[08:09.35]I woke up.
[08:11.70]That was weird.
[08:13.88]Oh no, everybody okay?
[08:17.64]Ugh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
[08:18.84]Hold on, let me go, I gotta get some water.
[08:20.95]I gotta drink.
[08:22.47]Okay.
[08:23.45]Mmm.
[08:24.61]That was good.
[08:25.09]That was weird.
[08:26.07]Goodnight, back to bed.
[08:27.85]I change the channel.
[08:29.47]I wake up.
[08:30.93]And there's a device in front of me.
[08:33.39]This device had two cylinders on the top.
[08:38.30]And in the middle was some machine.
[08:40.44]Some kind of machine.
[08:40.94]I don't know what the fuck it was.
[08:42.98]But it was a machine.
[08:45.04]That processed your piss.
[08:48.78]And I knew that, I knew what the machine was, and what this thing did is it processed your piss not by a computer, but it got sent to my Reddit for them to process and tell me what illnesses I have.
[09:05.08]So, this device, you're supposed to pee into a pee collector, pour it in, and my Reddit will tell me, give me a spreadsheet of all the fucking illnesses I have.
[09:21.06]So, I am supposed to be doing this.
[09:24.36]Oh, I guess this is what I have to do today.
[09:26.84]Yeah, I'm doing that.
[09:28.06]I want to know some things.
[09:29.94]But I don't want Reddit to know.
[09:32.70]But I don't know.
[09:33.54]That's kind of personal.
[09:37.64]So, Otto just peed into the cup.
[09:40.71]And gave it to me.
[09:41.83]I just took it from him.
[09:44.09]And I poured Otto's pee in there.
[09:46.95]Like, hey guys, coming in my pee.
[09:48.51]Here it is.
[09:52.90]And they, like, Reddit started to decipher all these problems that I had.
[10:01.64]And there were, like, comment threads about, man, this is, like, kind of weird.
[10:06.25]This doesn't seem like anything that we've ever seen here before on Reddit, like, on the Jerma Reddit.
[10:10.95]And I'm like, uh-oh.
[10:12.15]Oh, they know it's dog pee.
[10:13.37]What do I do?
[10:14.19]Like, I didn't want them to know that, like, I... It was, like, this weird social thing where, like, it's, like, a social media thing.
[10:22.23]And I was trying to circumvent me doing this?
[10:25.74]I have no idea.
[10:33.09]So, then...
[10:37.13]Then I... This is where it gets weird.
[10:40.29]So, like, I go, oh, let me try it again.
[10:43.62]And I don't know why, I don't... Look, you can't explain why you do things in dreams, but you just do.
[10:50.54]So this time, because people were starting to get a little, like, oh, what's going on here?
[10:54.24]This isn't... I don't think this is your pee.
[10:56.52]I did, like, half dog pee, and then I just... I just peed directly into the tube at the same time.
[11:06.76]And I'm like hoping that that was going to solve that problem.
[11:17.87]And then I woke up.
[11:22.38]Oh, I have to pee in a thing?
[11:23.94]What?
[11:24.60]Oh, that was weird.
[11:26.14]Strange.
[11:29.50]Okay, time to look at the water.
[11:34.81]Okay.
[11:36.11]That's better.
[11:37.93]Time to go back to bed.
[11:40.43]Change channel again.
[11:44.77]This one I don't remember that much.
[11:46.91]I have almost no memory of this one.
[11:48.37]All I remember is I was a blacksmith.
[11:51.41]That's it.
[11:51.85]I don't know anything else.
[11:58.84]I don't know what I was doing, what I was making.
[12:02.21]But I had this big... It was like a butcher's... It was like a butcher's cape.
[12:10.30]And it was like all butchery.
[12:12.06]And I had like big butcher gloves on.
[12:14.75]And I was like making... I was making something for somebody in my like blacksmithing store.
[12:22.99]And then I woke up and the sun was up.
[12:29.63]I don't... I... That's three separate TV shows that I jumped into halfway through the episode.
[12:38.30]Like, I walked in on a friend or a roommate watching the end of a movie three times.
[12:46.14]Like, the culmination, the asteroids are falling, here's the big climax of that movie.
[12:52.87]Dreams don't make any sense.
[12:54.95]No one will ever be able to tell us what they actually are.
[12:57.47]Ever.
[13:00.81]No one.
[13:01.31]I don't care if you want to explain it spiritually or scientifically.
[13:07.95]What the fuck?
[13:08.69]Why does that happen?
[13:11.23]Why can't we see inside of our own heads when we're sleeping?
[13:23.63]I don't know.
[13:28.79]To see a blacksmith in your dream represents inner strength and endurance.
[13:32.67]Perhaps the dream is telling you that you need to strike while the fire is hot or act while you have the opportunity.
[13:43.18]Okay.
[13:44.04]What does asteroids falling into Earth mean?
[13:47.44]Help me out here.
[13:55.25]Holy shit, somebody gave a lot of money.
[14:03.14]Holy shit.
[14:03.84]Alright.
[14:04.28]Hold on.
[14:05.84]I was too locked into telling my dreams.
[14:11.96]But we had Jerma lied about eating a shoe thanks to five community subs.
[14:15.50]Definitely.
[14:15.98]That's absolutely a lie.
[14:17.14]So I'm glad you made that account.
[14:18.68]Thanks for the five subs.
[14:21.14]And MVM Matt gave $100.
[14:23.02]10,000 bits.
[14:23.14]Thank you, MVM Matt, for the 10,000 bits.
[14:24.58]100 bucks.
[14:35.31]Huge amount of fucking money.
[14:36.19]Thank you for the incredibly kind message, Matt.
[14:40.23]And thanks for the hundred bucks.
[14:41.43]I only know how to be me.
[14:42.17]I don't know how to be anybody else, so I don't think that'll change.
[14:44.84]But thank you.
[14:45.14]Really appreciate that.
[15:07.18]To see an asteroid in your dream represents a spiritual message from above.
[15:10.22]You're about to be enlightened with some knowledge.
[15:12.90]Alternatively, it signifies a brainstorming of ideas and thoughts.
[15:16.14]If the asteroid hits the Earth, then it indicates that your idealistic notions are deteriorating or being shattered apart.
[15:25.47]Huh.
[15:27.17]Which one of those things confirms Sans for Smash?
[15:31.79]Alright, what about peeing?
[15:32.79]Okay, what about... Good luck with this one.
[15:35.77]peeing into a device that Reddit will tell you what illnesses you have, being embarrassed about that, and having your dog pee go in there instead, and then mixing your pee and your dog's pee in there to try to throw them off.
[15:49.88]What does that one mean?
[15:56.20]Another hundred bucks just came in.
[15:58.04]This is from Phylactery Lich.
[16:03.77]Thank you, Phylactery, for the hundred bucks back-to-back.
[16:05.67]It's okay, Jerma.
[16:06.35]I also have weird dream episodes sometimes.
[16:11.32]They can be weird.
[16:12.50]Dreams, I... Dreams, I... You ever get to the point where you have a dream, and you... you don't want to dream, and you'll do everything possible to get out of the dream?
[16:24.21]Wanna know what works for me?
[16:25.91]If you really wanna get out of a dream, this is real knowledge that I'm gonna drop on you here.
[16:29.86]This is a secret recipe to get the fuck out of a nightmare.
[16:33.00]You wanna know how to do it?
[16:36.58]You... close your eyes tight.
[16:40.74]And open them.
[16:42.23]If you blink, if you make you, if you blink in a dream tightly, if you go close your eyes tight, tight, tight, close your eyes, close your eyes, tight, you'll get up.
[16:52.74]In the dream, if you do that, do that.
[16:54.52]Consciously close your eyes.
[16:56.24]Blink, blink, blink.
[16:57.24]You'll get up.
[17:05.71]I just tried that.
[17:06.39]It works.
[17:07.01]See?
[17:09.45]Welcome back to reality.
[17:17.19]I'm talking to the mods of the speedrun academy.
[17:20.83]We determined you've broken too many rules for this run, so we cannot use this for the archive.
[17:26.01]Oh.
[17:26.89]Thanks.
[17:27.74]Thanks for the heads up.
[17:29.34]Thank you, though, to the both back-to-back $100 donations in 10,000 bits.
[17:34.28]By the way, I do have to say it because I'm a live streamer, okay?
[17:38.43]I'm a live streamer, therefore I have to say this.
[17:43.29]No, fuck it.
[17:43.83]I ain't gonna say it.
[17:45.33]No.
[17:46.09]You've already heard it a thousand times.
[17:47.23]Why would I... Why do I need to be the person to tell you this?
[17:53.47]You know?
[17:54.33]Every single livestream... I'll give you a hint.
[17:57.07]Every stream you have watched, every single one, in the last, like, four or five days, has said this word.
[18:05.32]And told you about it.
[18:06.40]So this has just been redundant information by this point.
[18:14.23]Sans is in Smash.
[18:15.27]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:21.67]I'll give you another hint.
[18:24.73]It is partnered up with a failing company that's closing all their stores.
[18:32.28]Take a guess.
[18:45.00]He hates this.
[18:46.52]No, I'm just saying.
[18:47.60]When was the last time you went into one?
[18:51.90]I haven't been in one.
[18:53.39]I'm just being real.
[18:55.29]I'm being realistic.
[19:01.61]Yesterday.
[19:05.18]I'm just being real.
[19:09.50]A day ago.
[19:19.15]Hey, who are you?
[19:20.47]You can't just barge in here.
[19:32.04]What is he talking about?
[19:34.18]What the fuck is he talking about?
[19:36.35]Alright.
[19:38.15]Everybody settle down for a minute.
[19:40.75]Here we go.
[19:45.36]Over the course of September, if you're a new sub, your Tier 1 subscription will be 50% off.
[19:57.95]Partnering up with Subway to... I'm actually... I'm not entirely sure what they're doing and what they're... why it's with Subway.
[20:14.23]It's only if it's your first time subbing, and I don't think community subs do it either.
[20:19.68]Why is it Subway?
[20:20.54]Do you get like a Subway sandwich or something?
[20:22.26]I don't get it.
[20:29.00]Okay.
[20:31.22]Beginning September 3rd at 1pm.
[20:33.60]In partnership with Subway, we're offering 50% off new tier 1 subscriptions.
[20:36.60]Alright, but what is Subway doing?
[20:41.35]I'm actually, I'm actually curious.
[20:43.21]Was it just there?
[20:45.45]Are they... Oh!
[20:51.43]Don't forget those bonus bits!
[20:53.78]Subway is throwing in 10% more bits when you cheer 10 or more.
[20:57.82]Thanks to Subway.
[20:59.20]Subway will be gifting subscriptions to various channels.
[21:01.92]Make sure to tune in of who they gift a sub to.
[21:05.82]And tune in when Subway launches their own Twitch channel.
[21:10.37]Wait, why is Sub... what?
[21:14.63]Why is Subway making a Twitch channel?
[21:21.69]Is this like the great rebranding of like 2020?
[21:23.89]Should I... Alright, I gotta play Mario RPG.
[21:37.48]Jerma, why don't you get sponsorships?
[21:39.74]I don't know.
[21:40.72]Rewind fucking five minutes.
[21:41.80]Alright, so...
[21:51.90]The last thing we did, we've been told that Mallow is not a frog.
[22:01.51]And that Mallow is, in fact, a giant bird who's in here.
[22:05.31]So who's the fucking faker?
[22:06.67]I'm in a weird mood today.
[22:08.07]I can already tell you that.
[22:14.34]So now, what was the actual... Okay, I've got to go.
[22:17.20]Let's talk.
[22:18.48]I used to work in the castle.
[22:20.46]You should see the way she hits poor Dodo.
[22:23.02]What a horrible wife he must have.
[22:24.30]That's fucked up.
[22:27.04]Alright.
[22:27.68]Did I buy anything from here?
[22:31.60]Say, you have that I'm looking for something to look in your eye.
[22:33.26]What can I do for you?
[22:33.93]I think I already bought stuff, right?
[22:36.85]Yeah, mega glove, war fan, you already got it.
[22:44.05]What was I doing here?
[22:45.11]I forget the next part of this.
[22:49.39]Wait, what was the last thing I did?
[22:52.17]Used to be so small.
[22:52.99]Now look at him.
[22:54.63]How do we get into that castle?
[22:56.19]I gotta remember this.
[22:58.11]King Nimbus loves statues and birds.
[22:59.61]He has scads of them in the castle.
[23:02.27]I think we have... Yeah, I remember.
[23:03.95]We gotta talk to, like, the sculpture person.
[23:08.77]You know about the royal bus?
[23:10.34]I do, actually.
[23:12.70]If you read this, I'll give you $50.
[23:13.72]Okay.
[23:13.94]Just did.
[23:22.56]Yeah, I thought, doesn't somebody... I swear that somebody recognizes... Mallow here.
[23:34.29]Wahoo.
[23:36.57]Yeah, this is it.
[23:37.31]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[23:43.34]Who's that?
[23:44.84]Hey, look, it's me!
[23:47.32]Oh, you mean that?
[23:48.52]That's King Nimbus.
[23:49.62]When he was, uh, young... Huh?
[23:55.36]What the?
[23:56.56]Who are you?
[23:58.69]Hello, my name is Mallow.
[24:00.37]And this is my friend Mario.
[24:03.77]Mallow?
[24:05.63]So it is you, my boy.
[24:08.55]It's been so long, my... You've become a splendid young prince.
[24:14.06]I'M A PRINCE?!
[24:16.48]WHAT?!
[24:18.32]I'm really a prince?!
[24:32.15]Mario, you're great at impressions.
[24:38.34]Wow, Mario, that was some mystique level shit there.
[24:41.26]Uh, yeah, I get it, I guess.
[24:43.34]You were raised by frog fuchsias.
[24:47.49]There's no question about it, you are without a doubt Prince Mallow.
[24:53.59]Mario, look at me, I'm a prince!
[24:57.43]I knew Valentina was up to something.
[24:59.39]I just didn't know what.
[25:01.21]That must mean that the king really isn't gravely ill.
[25:07.30]Then let's go inside the castle and save my mother and father!
[25:10.40]Right now!
[25:14.58]Hey, who are you?
[25:15.58]You can't just barge in here.
[25:26.29]Wait.
[25:27.03]I have an excellent idea.
[25:28.85]Get over here.
[25:34.98]Are you ready?
[25:35.36]Yes.
[25:38.24]Just stay still for a little while, okay?
[25:39.88]It won't take too long.
[25:52.77]There.
[25:55.96]Don't move.
[25:57.98]You're gonna be a statue for a little while, okay?
[26:01.56]Let's get going.
[26:03.86]Eternally Gaming just gave $50.
[26:06.02]A deal's a deal.
[26:09.28]You actually did it.
[26:10.67]I can't believe you actually did it.
[26:14.17]Well, I guess that, that, yeah.
[26:16.79]That's true, you did.
[26:20.11]If you keep, that means I have to eat a shoe.
[26:22.51]I don't like people doing the things they say they're gonna do.
[26:29.08]But thank you.
[26:29.78]They say a deal's a deal.
[26:30.58]Anyway, I gotta say that I think you're a great comedian.
[26:32.40]Watching you play games can be painful, but you're undoubtedly a pioneer in streaming.
[26:37.38]Love your creativity and talent as a comedian.
[26:43.37]Well, thank you.
[26:48.23]I appreciate that.
[26:49.39]Thanks a lot.
[26:50.01]If you think that I'm a good comedian, I...
[26:55.56]I hope you have fun.
[26:57.38]And if you are, then you are.
[26:58.76]And if you aren't, then I'm sorry.
[27:01.02]Hopefully you do next time.
[27:03.86]Painful at video games.
[27:07.29]Whatever.
[27:08.75]I do fine.
[27:09.63]I do fine.
[27:11.95]I'm doing just fine.
[27:17.51]What did you want to be when you grew up?
[27:18.67]A magic wand maker.
[27:21.25]Like for magicians and shit when I was in preschool.
[27:24.01]Well, thank you Eternally Gaming for the $50, and yeah, you did hold your word.
[27:31.87]I'm delivering Valentina's latest order to her.
[27:35.99]You may enter.
[27:38.41]Hey, wait, here goes the... Hey, this doesn't look like Valentina at all.
[27:47.50]Oh, that's because this is a statue of Alatina's nephew, Mariota, okay?
[27:56.53]Alright, proceed.
[28:06.94]There it was.
[28:07.26]Remember that noise I was waiting for this whole time?
[28:11.74]It just happened.
[28:12.56]So everyone thought I was crazy.
[28:13.56]I got lots of question marks last time.
[28:19.53]That was close.
[28:20.53]I didn't think we could just get through that one.
[28:22.57]There is no such person named Mariota.
[28:29.35]There it is.
[28:29.65]I don't even have to do it.
[28:34.23]Oh, now this is lovely.
[28:36.79]My beauty simply shines forth like the sun.
[28:40.33]Only you can make something this stunning.
[28:44.17]Thank you, your majesty.
[28:46.66]I'll be on my way now.
[28:49.28]Halt!
[28:52.22]What, may I ask, is this ugly thing?
[28:57.80]Oh, shit!
[28:59.38]That's my latest masterpiece I created just for you.
[29:03.12]It's called A Plumber's Lament.
[29:07.31]Observe the thick mustache covering the sad, innocent smile of a simple fool.
[29:13.95]And the sideburns conveying his blue-collar roots.
[29:19.38]and the legs well defined.
[29:21.84]Strong.
[29:23.05]The legs of the masses.
[29:25.21]Is it to your liking?
[29:29.85]Hmm.
[29:31.59]I consider myself something of an art buff, and I've got to say, this is spectacular.
[29:38.59]Garo, only you could have created sculptures with such gentle beauty and raw power.
[29:45.48]Thank you, your majesty.
[29:46.72]I'll be on my way now.
[29:51.14]Wink wink.
[29:52.24]Nudge.
[29:55.11]Spectacular.
[29:57.57]Dodo.
[29:58.25]Dodo.
[29:59.57]Don't just sit there like a roast.
[30:01.07]Hurry and carry these in.
[30:05.58]Dodo.
[30:06.16]Ow.
[30:10.74]Step on it.
[30:25.65]Uh-oh.
[30:27.43]Dodo.
[30:33.64]Oh, I remember this part.
[30:40.23]This is the pretend to be the statue part of the game.
[30:44.06]Haha!
[30:52.91]I love this part.
[30:53.53]Yeah, this part is just so... It's just... It's so cute.
[31:01.43]Dodo!
[31:04.45]Did you display the statues properly?
[31:07.51]Fine.
[31:08.27]Now polish them to a fine luster and make them a tribute to my beauty.
[31:14.32]Oh, shit.
[31:15.76]Pay attention to me.
[31:17.22]Hurry up and don't let me catch you dozing again.
[31:25.62]Uh-oh.
[31:26.90]Dodo's in a pretty bad mood.
[31:28.94]Keep up your statue disguise and jump to avoid getting picked.
[31:33.10]Get ready.
[31:34.30]Are you ready?
[31:35.02]Because he's coming right now.
[31:48.95]He's already... No, I told you the blue is the mouse.
[32:03.91]He missed!
[32:12.89]Ooh... Uh-oh!
[32:15.97]Did he catch me?
[32:31.19]I did it!
[32:44.94]Picked up a feather.
[32:47.56]I believe this is an accessory.
[32:51.68]Speed up by 20.
[32:52.60]Ooh.
[32:56.33]Peach has the EXP booster on.
[32:57.89]Now, I'm... I'm... I think...
[33:01.49]I think that somebody in the party just has to have this on.
[33:08.69]I don't think it has to be somebody in the actual fight.
[33:12.98]I'm almost certain of that.
[33:15.80]Can somebody confirm with me, please?
[33:19.50]Somebody has played this game five or six hundred times like I have?
[33:26.34]No.
[33:30.06]Why not?
[33:32.17]Maybe.
[33:32.45]Fuck you.
[33:33.27]Alright, well, thanks for the help.
[33:35.03]And then, uh, I've never played it.
[33:36.44]Okay.
[33:38.58]Yeah, give it to me.
[33:39.24]If you read this, yes.
[33:44.10]One guy.
[33:46.96]I don't even know what this game is.
[33:48.48]Alright, we're gonna test it.
[33:51.14]By the way, why is Mallow in the party?
[33:53.78]That's just... Excuse me.
[33:59.19]What are you doing in here?
[34:00.85]So let's test it out.
[34:01.81]Uh, the feather also is very, very good.
[34:05.39]So, Peach can have the feather on.
[34:06.67]Troopa Pin, yup.
[34:08.59]Amulet's still good.
[34:10.05]Ghost Metal, I think maybe... No, keep the Amulet on.
[34:13.74]Keep Mallow, keep Mallow, keep Mallow.
[34:16.32]Guys... Mallow doesn't have any stuff.
[34:19.84]I didn't buy his shit.
[34:23.08]Look, he even... He's got Mega Pants on.
[34:25.12]Like, he has shitty pants on.
[34:27.92]Keep Mallow or Riot.
[34:32.00]No.
[34:33.96]Maybe if I get to go back to town, I'll switch him out.
[34:36.60]Does that make you happy?
[34:42.73]Only the person holding it gets double EXP.
[34:44.59]They don't have to be in the party.
[34:45.61]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[34:47.01]So Mallow currently is getting double experience.
[34:50.09]I'm absolutely exhausted.
[34:53.51]Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[34:57.68]I hate being a guard.
[35:00.73]Valentina only gives us the most boring jobs to do.
[35:05.57]But I guess this beats Dodo's job.
[35:09.41]Dodo has to polish Valentina's statues every single day.
[35:14.80]This is how I would do it.
[35:23.54]Oh, hey.
[35:27.23]Tell me something.
[35:27.83]Do statues move?
[35:30.89]Now statues don't move.
[35:33.41]Then, uh, explain this.
[35:37.65]It's one of those high-tech, uh, lifelike, realistic ones.
[35:42.33]Let's get out of here.
[35:53.18]Hey, here we are.
[35:55.10]Actually, let me go.
[36:01.01]Yeah, we can go pretty much anywhere.
[36:02.83]Got that flower tab.
[36:03.79]Sick.
[36:03.97]Let's get a fight.
[36:13.29]Boom.
[36:14.05]Big Yoshi, big Yoshi, big Yoshi.
[36:18.36]What are you talking about?
[36:20.70]This is an absolute unit.
[36:32.44]absolute unit koopa alright level 16 totes duel it's time we pick we pick we pick we pick we pick hold on wait wait wait wait wait I gotta I didn't even put the extension turned on alright you guys can you guys can now click on it
[37:05.16]Absolute unit.
[37:08.89]Imagine being that much of a fucking unit.
[37:12.73]By the way, if you don't know how this works, you enable the extension and click on your screen.
[37:23.24]By the way, for the entire month of September, that's right, if you go outside,
[37:32.18]It's going to be a little cooler than it was last month.
[37:35.48]Fall is starting.
[37:37.80]Buy a jacket.
[37:38.36]Thank you for voting.
[37:39.38]Magic attack 72.
[37:40.20]Alright, what is this over here?
[38:04.01]Oh, that's right.
[38:04.69]He's a fan.
[38:05.29]Okay, let's go up this way.
[38:09.38]I got the tab.
[38:10.02]That's what I wanted.
[38:10.60]Actually, you know what?
[38:12.56]I want to go up.
[38:16.96]Because the fan blows, and... I'm going to wait for the fan to turn on.
[38:21.31]I think I can actually wrap around this fan.
[38:23.39]Oh, get out of here.
[38:24.85]Leave me alone.
[38:42.76]Come on, Mallow.
[38:43.34]Level up.
[38:45.52]I want to get rid of that.
[38:48.94]Genoblast, it just wipes out everybody.
[38:50.92]330, 330, 330.
[38:51.00]Mallow.
[38:51.28]Nope.
[38:51.50]It's Bowser.
[39:07.27]Level 16, 136, 144.
[39:08.95]No one's at 200 HP yet, which concerns me.
[39:13.83]By the way, if you click on Bowser, that counts as a middle vote.
[39:20.97]So, yes, we've made that clear already.
[39:47.06]Okay.
[39:47.26]Fine.
[39:47.42]That works.
[39:47.68]127 attack power, that's so much.
[39:49.00]That's too much.
[39:49.54]Got it.
[39:50.08]Nope.
[39:50.34]Okay, I couldn't block that for some reason.
[40:22.24]Okay, that was weird.
[40:30.98]Miss.
[40:32.72]I don't like that.
[40:33.26]I don't really think I'm going to kill it with the next punch, so I'm going to defend.
[40:45.55]Everyone's okay.
[40:46.33]Okay.
[40:53.16]Let me try a jump.
[40:58.70]Thank God.
[40:59.38]Jesus, that was the hardest fucking enemy in the game.
[41:03.77]I think that actually probably was the hardest thing I've ever faced in Super Mario.
[41:15.16]Look at that dodge!
[41:18.39]I was thinking about just getting hit over and over again and dying, but then I saved, like, too long ago.
[41:23.68]I didn't want to do that whole thing again.
[41:34.52]Pop.
[41:36.24]No!
[41:36.64]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[41:50.33]Heavy Trooper's ready to launch.
[41:54.15]If you let the Heavy Trooper launch, I believe everybody dies.
[41:57.91]That's 62.
[42:02.78]That's 64 EXP for Malwa.
[42:06.48]Malwa's gonna overlevel everybody.
[42:24.07]More magic.
[42:25.13]I should just give it to Bowser.
[42:29.41]Yeah.
[42:29.97]Okay, after this I'm gonna switch it over to Bowser.
[42:31.73]Because Bowser's gonna be unstoppable.
[42:39.77]You guys got all the flowers.
[42:40.95]Nice job.
[42:46.97]Eighty-four.
[42:47.71]Alright, let's give it to Bowser.
[42:52.11]We're gonna spread this thing around.
[43:00.91]Hey, wait a minute.
[43:01.45]It's locked.
[43:01.85]Ooh!
[43:03.73]Do you like that dodge?
[43:04.71]Whoa!
[43:05.53]He's like right up me.
[43:09.53]Awww.
[43:12.23]Jawful sleeping.
[43:14.23]Not for long.
[43:17.37]I love this character, by the way.
[43:18.39]He's just a fork.
[43:25.49]No!
[43:31.79]Oh god.
[43:34.53]Dropless sleeping again.
[43:35.63]We just genoblast everybody from here till the end of the game.
[43:41.15]That's how this works.
[43:46.64]Don't run.
[43:47.68]Don't run!
[43:50.50]Good, because these guys drop good stuff.
[43:51.92]44 coins.
[44:01.77]Grab this.
[44:02.67]Here it is, another tab.
[44:03.67]The bird cage is right in the way.
[44:13.42]It's okay.
[44:16.27]You know what I'm gonna do.
[44:17.51]Oh no, I ran out of power points.
[44:20.11]That's alright.
[44:35.42]Truffles awake!
[44:47.01]I'll be honest, that's the face that I make too, when I just wake up.
[44:50.43]If somebody just wakes me up abruptly... You kind of sit there like, wait, does this remind them real?
[45:01.18]Ow!
[45:13.17]Why are you taking so much damage now?
[45:16.07]Oh, dude, that face went laughing my ass off.
[45:20.15]Is this experience?
[45:21.02]It is!
[45:21.48]Alright, this is important.
[45:22.44]Follow it.
[45:23.10]Pay attention!
[45:23.54]Click over to the new tab!
[45:25.46]It's the right one, I think.
[45:27.44]Don't take my word for it, though.
[45:36.91]Am I wrong?
[45:38.57]Don't listen to me.
[45:39.71]Use your own judgment.
[45:51.37]Alright, I'm gonna go with the- Alright, I hope you're right.
[45:56.59]How are you guys right every fucking time?
[45:58.99]I don't understand.
[46:01.07]How can you get that every single time?
[46:05.36]You have not been wrong once!
[46:21.45]We're gamers, unlike you.
[46:23.21]Well, maybe some of you are, because 15% of you clicked on Peach's face.
[46:28.87]So, come on.
[46:29.97]Give me a break.
[46:30.47]You have to go to the bathroom?
[46:32.75]Can I stop for a second?
[46:35.00]Yeah, go on.
[46:35.96]You have 30 seconds to go pee, whatever you're doing.
[46:56.27]I should just change games before they get back.
[46:59.75]And just act like nothing happened.
[47:01.29]What are you talking about, man?
[47:02.91]Like, with Super Mario RPG, no.
[47:22.91]We're playing Dead Cells!
[47:24.69]Are you alright?
[47:26.19]What are you talking about?
[47:34.42]Go download a save file from somewhere.
[47:36.60]There's like 7,000 hours in the game and I have every ability and shit.
[47:48.09]Switch to XCOM and name everybody Mario, Malo, Peach, and Bowser.

[48:25.22]Because, like, only 14%.
[48:33.66]How many people went into the voting booth and, like, sneezed on the paper and, like, moved their pencil and just left?
[48:39.96]How many people went into the voting booth in the last election and just, like, put, like, a marker on, like, the letter T?
[48:54.63]This is... This is the... Okay.
[48:59.23]10, 12, 12... 8%, 8%.
[49:05.91]They just take the pencil and leave.
[49:11.55]What did you do in the voting booth?
[49:13.37]Well, I... I drew a smiley face.
[49:17.81]And there was some calligraphy on the... On the voting ballot, and I circled it.
[49:23.39]Did you vote for anything that was supposed to be voted for?
[49:26.82]What?
[49:28.54]No, a left calligraphy gang.
[49:31.42]And then they walk away.
[49:33.04]Okay.
[49:39.26]Oh, I guess we're going with power.
[49:51.13]No, I gotta pay... Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

[50:40.03]You go in, like, you go in whatever the ballot, whatever you're voting for.
[50:44.54]And you kind of, it's like, one, two, three, four, five, right?
[50:47.92]I just imagine, like, some old person just, like, speaking like a confessional through the wall.
[50:55.80]Hey, who are you voting for?
[50:57.96]I don't know what to do.
[51:02.86]Can I see your paper?
[51:04.14]I didn't study.
[51:18.39]I didn't study this test.
[51:29.86]Holy shit, there's a lot of corns.
[51:31.32]Ooh, and watch.
[51:33.06]Click, click, over here, over here, over here.
[51:36.51]I know which one it is.
[51:36.99]It's the middle, I think.
[51:37.83]That one's gonna be...
[52:01.23]Yoshi and Yoshi are both selected.
[52:07.96]Yoshi and Yoshi.
[52:09.66]You guys are wrong.
[52:13.32]We lost all that experience.
[52:14.48]You shouldn't have listened to me.
[52:27.80]What's double of... Can you get double of zero?
[52:30.26]No, that's math, Jeremy.
[52:32.00]That's math.
[52:32.64]It doesn't work that way.
[52:38.10]No, I'm just going to do it now because I keep forgetting to do it.
[52:46.05]You should have just clicked on Yoshi.
[52:49.05]I should have.
[52:49.45]It's fine.
[53:05.87]Um, I know you guys are saying, oh, big chunky guy, big chu- big, uh, chunky chewy guy, whatever, right?
[53:14.98]No, that's a hamster that has a shell on it as like a funny little joke.
[53:21.52]That's just a hamster, guys.
[53:23.02]That's not a Koopa Troopa.
[53:34.42]Oh fuck, is everybody dead?
[53:38.82]He didn't do it, okay.
[53:53.27]God, I can't even say what you said.
[53:55.93]What is wrong with you guys?
[54:00.33]I'm laughing, I'm laughing, I think it's funny, whatever.
[54:02.55]I don't have any mushrooms.
[54:19.35]No, that's not what I read.
[54:21.49]Couldn't die.
[54:22.49]Come on.
[54:25.91]Here we go.
[54:27.07]Back to cheating.
[54:34.83]That's not what I laughed at.
[54:35.83]No, it's not.
[54:50.40]We get a lot of experience though here.
[54:52.92]This is pretty cool.
[54:54.56]Oh, I found everybody.
[54:55.83]I used to be a guard here until Valentina snatched away all my keys and gave me the boot.
[55:10.70]Guess I won't be needing this master key anymore.
[55:13.14]Would you like it?
[55:16.00]Alright, here you go.
[55:17.16]Just don't tell me what you're gonna do with it, okay?
[55:23.66]Do you know that there are hot springs around here?
[55:25.56]Mm-hmm.
[55:27.66]Ooh, you're no fun.
[55:28.48]I wanted to be the first to tell you.
[55:31.85]Go on, take this.
[55:33.91]Flour jar.
[55:36.55]A dip in the hot springs would perk up the king in a jiffy.
[55:41.39]Hey, did you know?
[55:42.59]Valentina's got a huge egg in the middle room.
[55:46.07]It spits out eggs from time to time, and sometimes when you shield yourself, the eggs will ricochet off of you.
[55:53.89]How do you know this?
[56:01.57]Okay, through here.
[56:11.63]I thought he was an NPC.
[56:22.59]Those of you that don't want Geno in Smash, after seeing that, okay.
[56:28.20]Sans got in before Geno.
[56:46.00]I'm just imagining the posts.
[56:48.27]Sans from Undertale gets in before Geno like a laughing fucking laughing guy.
[57:12.19]Gino isn't in Smash, but Sans gets in?
[57:15.17]Compilation of celebrities laughing hysterically.
[57:19.14]In an image.
[57:49.29]You're mad.
[57:50.07]You're one of them that's mad about Sans.
[57:52.91]Holy shit, Bowser's leveled up again.
[57:54.91]Whoa.
[57:58.03]Why would I be mad about a character getting put into Smash Bros?
[58:02.66]Really?
[58:04.70]Why would I be angry that somebody gets to be happy that somebody that they like to play as or have cared about gets to be in one of their favorite games?
[58:13.04]Why would that make me angry?
[58:16.45]No, I think that's great.
[58:17.81]Alright, where we going?
[58:21.09]He's mad.
[58:21.81]He's just... Ooh, nice.
[58:22.97]This is a tough one.
[58:24.85]I thank you, WingusDingus69 for the 10 community subs.
[58:46.10]Thank you for the 10 subs, Wingus Dingus.
[58:47.91]Come on, pick one.
[58:48.73]Pick one!
[58:49.19]You're going back and forth here.
[58:50.77]Okay.
[58:51.29]You've decided.
[59:18.44]Thank you for going.
[59:19.56]I'm going HP.
[59:20.91]Ooh, HP was not the right choice.
[59:23.03]HP, wrong choice.
[59:25.63]One.
[59:25.81]That's not good.
[59:33.35]No, stop it.
[59:34.27]Leave me alone.
[59:34.91]I just want the treasure.
[59:38.29]Thank you.
[59:43.95]There's the key.
[59:44.75]Leave you... Uh-oh.
[59:50.77]Look what I get to do again.
[59:52.14]I get to make 150 to 200 people leave the stream.
[60:01.44]La dee da.
[60:03.32]Here you go, big eggy.
[60:05.81]I'll give you plenty of nutrients so you'll grow up to be big and strong.
[60:09.03]Oh, oh.
[60:13.25]Mario's already here.
[60:15.41]He's a fast one, he is.
[60:21.17]It won't open it's not Let me try I'm so lonely.

[61:53.05]Thank you.
[61:54.81]Again, ultra jump.

[62:12.58]Shit!
[62:14.62]Tee hee.
[62:15.78]Ouch, you're hurting me.
[62:17.48]Now it's my turn.
[62:19.24]Get it while it's hot.
[62:26.46]Too many subs.
[62:27.90]Too many subs.
[62:28.60]That's 69 subs.
[62:29.92]None of those are half off.
[62:32.08]I hope you're aware of that.
[62:34.34]That's 69 subs from Phylactery Lich.
[62:41.36]69 subs.
[62:42.22]Too many subs.
[62:46.18]Thank you, though, Phylactery.
[62:47.20]That's an absolute shitload.

[62:58.97]So this one's for you.

[63:07.39]Fuck.
[63:07.67]113 damage.
[63:28.58]I'll get it.
[63:32.02]But, oh, seriously, Phylactery, that's... You're encroaching on like 500 fucking subs on the channel.
[63:38.95]Something insane like that.
[63:41.75]I have to get this, come on!
[64:00.17]Dammit, I keep getting stopped at like 19, 20.
[64:05.60]You have to beat Cairo Toby.
[64:11.56]Well, it's never a competition.
[64:12.94]Alright, again.
[64:44.97]Alright, I've had enough.
[64:50.16]Nevermind.
[64:54.20]15!
[64:54.22]15!
[64:54.36]I know!
[64:54.74]I gotta get 30!
[64:59.67]Come on!
[65:00.23]I'm out of points!
[65:03.41]Ow.
[65:08.17]Alright.
[65:10.06]Alright.
[65:10.62]Alright, ghetto.
[65:19.65]Peach really is incredible I used to fill my inventory with junk Okay, here we go
[65:41.20]no so those of you that don't know the timing of the jump changes after 12 to 15 jumps what ends up happening is it shrinks to about like two pixels after 15 or so so trying to find the timing is very hard I'm gonna do it oh I'm never gonna let you go you're just too cute
[66:18.44]Castle Key 2.
[66:21.07]I'm never gonna give you up.
[66:23.35]I'm never gonna give you up.
[66:26.91]Come on, like, just hold the stick.
[66:28.61]Hold the stick in your hand, jump, swing.
[66:33.47]It's all you need to do, Mario.
[66:34.77]Come on.
[66:45.15]We're all good.
[66:49.24]I forgot.
[66:51.46]Oh no.
[66:51.92]It's a Pinwheel.
[66:52.62]Oh no.
[66:52.88]It's a Pinwheel.
[66:53.54]Come on.
[67:35.07]Right at that 15, 16, it goes down to like one pixel.
[67:40.94]God.
[67:41.38]I didn't get 30 on Pinwheel.
[67:50.35]I know.
[67:50.89]I'm an idiot.
[68:04.11]Ooh, that was a lot of coins.
[68:07.60]Uh-oh, we've got an issue here.
[68:10.48]This is luck, too.
[68:16.82]Mario.
[68:18.80]Look, there's a note.
[68:19.46]Let's read it.
[68:24.68]King Nimbus is resting in bed.
[68:27.36]Absolutely no running in the heart.
[68:29.87]From Queen Valentina.
[68:32.20]This can only mean that mom and dad are in here.
[68:35.30]Oh, but it's locked.
[68:37.94]Leave it to me.
[68:40.86]Looks like it's up to me to get us out of yet another jam.
[68:44.54]Feast your eyes on this show of brains and brawn.
[68:50.98]Stand back.
[68:56.89]Wait!
[68:57.45]Wait a minute!
[68:59.29]If my dad's really bedridden, we shouldn't make so much noise.
[69:04.16]We need another plan.
[69:07.58]I guess we should find Valentina and force the truth out of her.
[69:12.48]Uh, Bowser, I don't want to tell you this, but, you know, I'm pointing at my nose.
[69:19.74]I'm, like, looking at you.
[69:20.58]I'm looking at you.
[69:21.20]Direct eye contact.
[69:22.23]Hey, like, touching under my nose.
[69:24.09]Like, wipe.
[69:24.83]Like, wipe under your fucking nose, dude.
[69:26.73]Like, we're, like, at a party.
[69:30.71]But what about the door?
[69:39.80]Listen, you.
[69:41.00]Never, ever talk to the leader of the Koopa Troop like that.
[69:44.82]Oh, I hate that.
[69:49.35]I'll ignore it this time, but don't let that happen again.
[69:55.21]Queen Valentina?
[69:56.01]Queen Valentina?
[70:20.69]It's like someone's reading a book to kids.
[70:26.40]No, but the only difference is I would be, like, falling asleep halfway through.
[70:36.56]That's what my mother used to do.
[70:38.84]She would start to pass out, like, fall asleep while reading stories.
[70:48.74]Uh-oh, heavy troop is coming in.
[71:02.52]Here we go.
[71:04.98]Queen Valentina.
[71:05.97]This is what my mother would do.
[71:08.57]So she'd, like, do voices and stuff.
[71:09.97]That Mario creature who beat up Smilax is here.
[71:14.09]Mario?
[71:16.37]What does a Mario look like?
[71:19.13]Well, it is a bushy mustache, long sideburns, and a pair of mean-looking legs.
[71:23.35]Hmm, I have a feeling I've seen this Mario before.
[71:31.87]And I'd be like, Mom?
[71:32.77]Uh, wait, yes.
[71:36.24]That was the statue that Goro just delivered.
[71:39.74]What are we going to do?
[71:40.68]What are we going to do with Valentina?
[71:43.36]Well, we certainly aren't going to listen to your pointless chatter.
[71:45.48]Hmm.
[71:48.99]Mom, what happens next?
[71:50.39]Frankly speaking, I'm not going to worry without this key.
[71:53.83]The king can't go anywhere.
[71:54.81]This is real.
[71:58.60]This happened.
[72:05.82]I'm not telling a joke.
[72:06.80]This is reality.
[72:07.74]This has happened.
[72:10.84]My mother worked hard, okay?
[72:12.84]Give me a break.
[72:14.44]Hush!
[72:19.05]I said shut up already.
[72:23.53]What the?
[72:24.39]That isn't a statue.
[72:25.83]That's Mario.
[72:28.82]Valentina, hand over the key now.
[72:33.28]My leg.
[72:38.28]How utterly rude.
[72:39.48]And who in the blazes are you anyways?
[72:43.06]Me?
[72:43.38]I'm the real Prince, that's who.
[72:46.54]Brat.
[72:47.69]How dare you listen in on a private conversation?
[72:52.27]Private?
[72:53.70]Private?
[72:54.10]Everybody in a 10-mile radius could hear you.
[72:59.22]If you're going to be this rude, I'm simply going to leave.
[73:02.18]So long, chumps.
[73:07.42]Hey, Valentina ran away.
[73:09.77]I shall fly the coop too.
[73:20.20]Uh, I think we've kind of missed the boat here.
[73:23.64]So we better get moving too.
[73:25.38]Let's go!
[73:26.16]Get her!
[73:34.96]Uh, ooh, didn't mean to do that.
[74:02.03]I think Dodo is cute.
[74:03.25]Dodo is cute.
[74:05.05]Here comes the launch.
[74:08.39]Somebody leveled up?
[74:10.65]No.
[74:33.11]See that nice dodge?
[74:38.15]Oh fuck!
[74:39.23]I forgot this was here!
[74:45.14]I just killed Dodo!
[74:46.48]Oh shit!
[74:47.70]Dodo!
[74:48.84]No!
[74:49.20]Oh, poor Dodo!
[74:53.59]I just starred him!
[75:05.02]Hot springs are up ahead, but only royalty can go there.
[75:07.64]You don't look like royalty.
[75:12.98]Alright, I... what have I got?
[75:17.24]I have, like, items.
[75:20.32]Max mushroom, max mushroom, honey syrup.
[75:22.14]I have way too many honey syrups.
[75:23.90]I'll do the flower jar, though.
[75:26.31]I'll take it.
[75:28.11]Froggy drink, Carol Carol cola.
[75:34.20]Okay.
[75:35.08]Shall we?
[75:42.49]Queen Valentina!
[75:46.89]Queen Valentina, is the king showing any sign of improvement?
[75:50.55]And how is his wife, the old queen?
[75:53.22]And Tubby, I mean Prince Mallow, where is he hiding these days?
[75:57.56]You know what I think?
[75:58.22]I think... Get out of here!
[75:59.96]The truth... Let me tell you... You know what I think...
[76:07.63]Pipe down, all of you.
[76:09.91]I have better things to do than listen to your half-wit opinions.
[76:13.68]And look, while I've been wasting my time listening to your endless chatter, Mario has managed to find me.
[76:22.44]Dodo?
[76:23.54]Dodo?
[76:26.06]Oh, that bird has a permanent brain cramp.
[76:29.04]Dodo, do you hear me?
[76:29.88]Get over here now.
[76:30.62]I need some help entertaining Mario.
[76:33.74]So move it!
[76:35.00]Come over here now!
[76:40.04]Please, I killed him.
[76:42.36]Dodo?
[76:43.64]Dodo?
[76:45.82]Where are you?
[76:48.63]Don't just sit there.
[76:49.39]Help me!
[76:49.79]Uh-oh.
[76:56.93]One-on-one.
[77:02.43]Gino versus Dodo.
[77:05.57]Uh-oh.
[77:06.55]Can't do anything besides attack normally.
[77:18.42]Toy versus a bird.
[77:21.30]Yeah.
[77:22.42]What an exhilarating fight this will be.
[77:29.10]Wait!
[77:34.93]We're all good.
[77:41.00]Uh, Valentina kind of looks like Hey Arnold.
[77:43.94]I'm just realizing this for the first time.
[77:46.60]It's like Stewie Griffin.
[77:48.98]Or Hey Arnold, but Stewie Griffin.
[77:59.21]The same, like, squished head.
[78:01.87]Alright, here we go!
[78:27.70]No!
[78:27.82]17 every time!
[78:28.58]Ah!
[78:40.43]No, I'm trying to- the timing's so hard!
[78:49.49]I'm trying to change it up.
[78:52.01]It's after 16 is where it becomes one frame, I believe.
[79:02.82]Where's my emulator where I can slow down time, like how everybody did this?
[79:11.12]Dodo, how could you lose already?
[79:13.94]Oh, come on, get over here.
[79:25.44]Uh oh, drain beam.
[79:26.86]Are we doing alright?
[79:33.22]Geno still can't do anything.
[79:34.66]Alright, we're gonna go for... We're gonna go, we're gonna go for Dodo first.
[79:39.55]Sorry.
[79:44.11]Oh shit.
[80:15.19]Stop hurting him.
[80:16.25]He's hurting me!
[80:18.87]Uh, somebody stick a mushroom here.
[80:23.14]No, I'll be fine.
[80:26.28]It's a max mushroom, why would I do that?
[80:47.14]How many was that?
[80:49.58]How many was that?
[80:50.22]18?
[80:53.02]Fuck.
[80:53.44]Uh oh, this is bad.
[80:57.36]This is really bad.
[80:58.18]Peach is dead.
[80:59.42]Um... No, Peach is alive.
[81:06.45]This is more important than Genome.
[81:12.89]Ow.
[81:20.03]Do it only with sound cues.
[81:21.41]That actually might be a better idea.
[81:23.85]Oops.
[81:37.32]Oh, sick.
[81:37.80]I just got 18!
[81:38.34]Alright.
[81:43.56]Peach can't do any heals.
[81:46.82]I'm gonna try doing it with sound next time.
[81:49.15]Should I do Lucky Jewel?
[81:51.13]I think it's time.
[81:52.51]Lucky Jewel, you ready?
[81:54.45]At the end of this, you guys have to get it right.
[81:57.23]It's time for Lucky Jewel.
[82:04.85]Lucky.
[82:05.89]There it is.
[82:09.05]We are doubling something here.
[82:19.82]You gotta use your shit.
[82:21.81]I hold onto these items so much, it's just stupid.
[82:31.59]Boom.
[82:40.68]2-11.
[82:40.92]See you later.
[82:53.42]Isn't Lucky Jewel infinite?
[82:54.42]Is it?
[82:54.64]I thought it was just one time.
[82:55.66]I'm gonna do this only with sound.
[82:59.20]You ready?
[82:59.76]It didn't help.
[83:18.98]What was that?
[83:26.69]20.
[83:27.03]Shit.
[83:28.95]I don't believe this.
[83:31.95]The show's over, folks.
[83:33.71]Dodo, let's get out of here.
[83:37.15]Alright, those of you that are not paying attention, I need you to pay attention now.
[83:41.22]So, come back over here.
[83:43.30]Because this is important.
[83:51.98]Whoa!
[83:56.02]There we go.
[83:57.50]This is... This is 200 coins and 40 experience.
[84:00.40]So we're gonna get 80 experience.
[84:02.91]You ready?
[84:03.27]This is important.
[84:06.89]Here we go.
[84:13.56]Which one?
[84:19.10]We're gonna... The whole team will level up if we do this.
[84:22.44]And by we, I mean you.
[84:24.52]And by you, I mean 3,000 people here.
[84:25.79]All of you.
[84:26.43]Okay.
[84:27.87]Alright, this is pretty unanimous.
[84:30.05]Good.
[84:45.13]it's 80 experience so that's a hundred and that's bowser's gonna level up like at least once bowser's doubling his exp that's 160. feature level 17.
[85:11.32]Nice job, guys.
[85:12.08]You did it.
[85:13.24]You get it.
[85:13.60]You did it.
[85:13.86]You did it.
[85:14.34]I'm very, very happy.
[85:15.16]Very grateful.
[85:23.28]More power.
[85:26.08]What stat is good for Peach?
[85:29.08]I would say, reliably, magic, damage, magic, defense, and HP.
[85:41.71]Not long.
[86:02.21]Somebody says, hey, I have another question for you.
[86:04.83]Has anyone really been far even has decided to use a Google want to do look more like?
[86:09.05]If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.
[86:10.61]Uh, yes.
[86:17.99]Magic it is.
[86:19.37]Everybody levels up today.
[86:20.68]Here comes another one.
[86:21.50]Bowser, level 18.
[86:22.10]Alright, we gotta take this off.
[86:23.58]Bowser's gonna be over-leveled, but that's good.
[86:25.70]We're gonna need it.
[86:30.67]Bowser Crush.
[86:32.07]He has learned.
[86:32.55]100%.
[86:32.57]Wow.
[86:32.73]That was almost 200 clicks at 100% on the left side.
[86:35.93]That's pretty remarkable.
[86:37.55]And it's not even close, so...
[87:02.47]139.
[87:02.53]Hmm.
[87:10.75]Great.
[87:11.09]They're gone.
[87:14.51]Hmm.
[87:15.73]Hurry, let's go after her.
[87:16.61]I know she has a key.
[87:20.99]Ow.
[87:22.73]Ow.
[87:24.73]Huh?
[87:24.97]Mario, look.
[87:32.14]I didn't mean to eat that.
[87:45.91]That's cute.
[87:47.61]That's very cute.
[87:54.41]How adorable.
[87:57.79]Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Mario.
[88:01.75]and my other travel companions.
[88:05.75]I say, how did we ever thank you enough?
[88:08.85]I'm Balos Thor, King Limbus.
[88:12.62]Hello, everyone.
[88:13.74]Thank you so much for looking after my dear child.
[88:17.34]Allow me to introduce everyone.
[88:20.52]This is Princess Toadstool from Mushroom Kingdom.
[88:24.46]Ah, I haven't heard so much about you.
[88:25.94]May I have your autograph?
[88:29.22]Don't embarrass Junior, dear.
[88:32.50]Oh, never mind.
[88:34.02]And who is this gentleman over here?
[88:37.13]This is Super Mario.
[88:39.19]He helped me from the start.
[88:41.51]Why, I sincerely thank you for the bargain, Mario.
[88:46.91]You don't mean THE Mario?
[88:49.37]The Jumping Mario?
[88:51.19]Autograph, please.
[88:54.45]That's quite enough, dear.
[88:56.96]Okay, alright.
[88:58.16]Show him just a little jump.
[89:00.70]A tiny one will do.
[89:04.13]Do the thing, Mario.
[89:06.79]Make us all happy.
[89:11.03]Fantastic!
[89:12.91]Show me ever getting later.
[89:16.38]And who do we have over here?
[89:19.64]This is Bowser, leader of the Koopa Troop.
[89:24.06]Another famous person.
[89:25.22]This was too much for me.
[89:27.43]I must have your autograph.
[89:30.25]Dear, behave yourself, please.
[89:33.28]No, not even a scribble?
[89:35.06]Okay, alright.
[89:36.14]Fine.
[89:37.40]Yes, yes, yes, I'm quite forgetting my manners.
[89:39.70]Well, what do we have over here?
[89:43.09]This is Gino, who I told you about before.
[89:47.21]Oh, yes, the story about the Star Street.
[89:49.23]Oh, how awful.
[89:52.67]That's Star Road.
[89:57.06]By the way, a little before Valentina took over, a large star fell into the volcano.
[90:02.02]Oh!
[90:03.12]Hmm.
[90:04.00]Well, the dreaded Tsar Dragon inhabits the volcano.
[90:07.90]It's going to be tough for getting a star out of there.
[90:11.30]Perhaps all of you working together could handle that beast.
[90:15.62]Why, when I was young, I... Yes, dear.
[90:19.07]Yeah, okay.
[90:19.61]Now, once at the volcano, find Hinopio.
[90:23.79]He'll be able to help you.
[90:28.33]You be careful, Mallow.
[90:31.55]Okay, Mom.
[90:32.63]But I probably won't come back until we find the star.
[90:34.59]What do you got back here?
[90:45.02]Any treasures for me?
[90:45.96]Yeah.
[90:49.18]Yep.
[90:50.02]Mm-hmm.
[90:51.17]There it is.
[90:52.29]Flower tab.
[90:53.13]I'll take it.
[91:01.06]Okay, so now I'm gonna do something that a lot of people don't know exists, and even if you do... That's just the way it is.
[91:10.60]I ain't gonna use it.
[91:14.62]Not yet.
[91:14.98]Oh, the bird.
[91:19.54]There is a secret that I'm about to get.
[91:20.96]And there's a debate whether or not you should actually put it on or not.
[91:27.76]The king gave me another job as a guard.
[91:30.71]Prince Mallow!
[91:32.55]Thank you so much.
[91:33.97]We were able to rescue my father with the key you gave us.
[91:36.93]Don't mention it.
[91:38.20]Besides, it was you who actually rescued him.
[91:41.96]Good luck in the future.
[91:44.00]You too.
[91:45.66]Prince, uh... Here, this is from me.
[91:52.22]Please, take it.
[91:54.26]Flower jar.
[91:58.27]Did you know that there are hot springs?
[92:00.43]Yes, I know.
[92:04.79]That's a PogChamp moment right there, I would say.
[92:08.32]Yeah, all the statues are back to normal.
[92:09.86]This is no longer a bad play.
[92:11.58]Look at this.
[92:12.04]Look at this.
[92:18.06]Everybody.
[92:20.98]This statue, it seems so unworldly.
[92:25.73]Came to see the King's statue collection.
[92:27.37]I tell you it's remarkable.
[92:36.15]It's very cool.
[92:38.95]Alright, let's go in here.
[92:53.30]Go pawn the statues.
[92:54.54]Why would I do that?
[93:01.69]What happened?
[93:02.09]I left.
[93:02.39]Did he eat the shoe?
[93:03.15]Uh-huh.
[93:09.12]He missed it.
[93:09.64]I had to delete the clip, though.
[93:16.12]I deleted the VOD.
[93:18.48]Alright, everybody.
[93:20.18]If you don't want to be spoiled on Super Mario RPG's Secrets of the Seven Stars, a secret in the game, please do yourself a favor and you should have played this game ten years ago.
[93:47.25]No, not 20 years ago, because it was re-released like four times 10 years ago.
[93:52.99]I was too young.
[93:53.77]Uh-oh, busted.
[93:58.95]What do I do?
[93:59.61]What to do?
[94:00.01]What to do?
[94:00.39]I'll give you this fertilizer if you let me go, okay?
[94:07.10]Receive the fertilizer.
[94:17.78]He just shit in a bucket and gave it to you.
[94:20.26]Well, maybe so.
[94:25.66]Ready?
[94:26.78]Let's go!
[94:29.02]Let's go.
[94:29.82]Let's go.
[94:30.50]Let's go.
[94:31.10]Do it.
[94:31.82]But first, let's go to the hot springs.
[94:36.70]Hey, you're the real prince!
[94:37.58]Sorry about the misunderstanding before.
[94:39.00]There's no way that fat bird could have been a prince.
[94:42.85]No big deal.
[94:44.19]Anyway, do you think you could let us through?
[94:46.59]Of course.
[94:48.46]Go right ahead and enjoy yourself.
[94:51.50]But be careful not to fall into the volcano.
[94:56.57]Let's go relax.
[95:02.05]This part of the game... I remember every time I did this, I always wanted to go take a bath.
[95:16.78]Too hot.
[95:19.40]Well, you did it wrong, Mario.
[95:20.36]You're supposed to go in feet first, and then after two minutes you put your legs in.
[95:24.86]Then you put your butt in.
[95:25.82]After five minutes you put your, like, stomach in.
[95:28.24]You don't just go all in.
[95:34.18]Danger!
[95:34.64]Beyond the cliffs is the volcano.
[95:36.95]Yeah, but we're not doing that yet.
[95:42.89]I've got some secrets to do.
[95:54.53]Here we go.
[95:58.69]Have pants for Mallow to buy?
[96:02.32]Not yet.
[96:05.28]In a moment.
[96:05.78]Remember the seed we gave to this guy?
[96:15.66]Like, four or five hours ago?
[96:17.64]And by that I mean, like, stream four or five hours ago?
[96:21.08]Here we go.
[96:27.30]Oh, short attention span.
[96:28.00]Will you give it to me?
[96:28.82]Sure.
[96:28.96]I'll plant the seed.
[96:58.32]Then give it fertilizer.
[97:05.69]Nothing's happening.
[97:10.81]Oh!
[97:13.03]What?
[97:14.21]What?
[97:15.33]This is amazing.
[97:17.37]This is unreal.
[97:17.93]This is just like winning the lottery, only without the taxes.
[97:19.85]I mean, this is like falling out of an airplane without a parachute and hitting a crowd of geese in a mirror who break your fall.
[97:23.32]Wait a minute, my buddies are about heavy gardeners rather than your mothers.
[97:25.08]I'm going to be famous.
[97:27.06]You think it could use a little more fertilizer?
[97:31.24]Oops, maybe not, huh?
[97:36.79]This will get me in Happy Gardener monthly magazine.
[97:43.07]Don't mind if I climb this.
[97:44.32]Hey, what do we got here?
[97:51.00]Hmm... Boom!
[97:54.24]You got the lazy shell, and you got the lazy shell.
[98:00.99]Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're paying attention, because this is the best armor in the game.
[98:09.75]Besides one other item, I believe.
[98:11.39]Look at those stat changes.
[98:17.75]To give you a little bit of a look at that 63 defense and there's also a weapon look at that 198 damage Now anybody can wear the lazy shell and it essentially what it does is it makes that person 100% unkillable and
[98:44.23]Whoever wears the lazy shell will not fucking die.
[98:49.13]It is impossible.
[98:52.81]It's great.
[98:54.83]It's really good.
[98:57.33]But we're not going to use it right now.
[98:59.88]It's cheating.
[99:01.34]I will use the weapon.
[99:03.68]Or will I?
[99:05.64]Maybe.
[99:05.98]I don't know.
[99:07.00]Should I?
[99:10.24]Not this early.
[99:11.42]Not this early.
[99:16.45]Look at the magic attack, though.
[99:19.25]It makes you completely useless.
[99:22.55]It drags you down so hard in magic and attack, but it makes the person unable to die.
[99:28.78]Give it to Peach?
[99:29.40]Yeah, I will.
[99:31.20]I will, eventually.
[99:31.94]But I just... I have it.
[99:34.28]I have it.
[99:35.65]I have the two, essentially, best weapons and the best items in the game.
[99:40.42]So, you know, I'll use it when I need to.
[99:43.80]Like, when I fight Koolex.
[99:48.60]Because I'll fucking win!
[99:50.64]I will beat Koolex with the lazy shell on.
[99:59.91]Because that's how everybody beats Koolex.
[100:04.69]Hey, shit, use item.
[100:06.03]I will.
[100:07.86]Hold on, there's more to see.
[100:11.10]Not yet.
[100:11.84]Just hold on a minute.
[100:19.44]So there are a few more areas left to go.
[100:24.54]Use that item or I'm going to go to sleep.
[100:26.10]Have a good night.
[100:27.86]I'm going to use it.
[100:41.97]You're using hacks on Culex.
[100:44.77]That's not... It's in the game.
[100:49.65]It's in the game.
[100:50.65]Alright, I have to... I gotta pee.
[100:58.59]No, I'm gonna hold my pee for a minute.
[101:00.05]Let me get to the next town.
[101:01.55]Alright, I gotta go to the hot springs and then go down.
[101:06.59]But, I'm gonna buy the pants.
[101:08.09]No, I'm not.
[101:08.49]Why would I do that?
[101:08.99]I'm about to go to a new area.
[101:25.81]Time for the volcano.
[101:26.80]I love that.
[101:32.95]I also love this song.
[102:03.53]The bass guitar is objectively the best instrument.
[102:07.60]I think it's one of the most important instruments.
[102:14.08]I think it's one of the most important ones.
[102:29.26]Bracer.
[102:29.62]I have some of the items I gotta get rid of.
[102:32.07]Because we are getting towards the endgame here.
[102:43.65]You know what I'm saying?
[102:49.24]Oh!
[102:49.80]That just kind of creeped up on me.
[102:56.52]Mario, leveled up.
[103:02.98]Very good, very good, very good.
[103:03.94]Where does Mario RPG sit on my favorite all-time games list?
[103:09.10]There are five, probably, that are all in the same spot.
[103:13.86]Power.
[103:36.76]I cannot decide.
[103:37.84]Gino Flash!
[103:38.43]That would have been a really cool Final Smash.
[103:40.81]You'll see it.
[103:41.47]I'll show it to you.
[104:06.73]Alright, super.
[104:07.93]87 magic tech.
[104:08.81]So we gotta go this way.
[104:10.15]How much money do I have?
[104:11.11]999?
[104:11.19]Almost.
[104:11.41]663.
[104:11.43]Why don't we take a look at it?
[104:12.71]This is Genoflash.
[104:37.81]The ultimate move.
[104:47.68]He turns into a cannon and he shoots out the sun.
[104:52.38]It sucks.
[104:59.22]What?
[105:07.21]It doesn't suck.
[105:10.91]Look, I'll show you again.
[105:14.79]That's 440 damage.
[105:15.57]It sucks?
[105:16.29]440 damage?
[105:18.85]Have you been counting?
[105:40.38]Oh, you gotta jump.
[105:42.86]Ah, come on.
[105:45.46]I can get it.
[105:46.38]That's really group hug, huh?
[106:06.93]Ah, I gotta get rid of all these things.
[106:20.73]We're gonna have to fight, like, two things back to back to back here.
[106:23.04]It's alright, I'm just gonna genoblast them.
[106:27.10]Just gonna do that twice.
[106:41.63]Get rid of Peach and use Bowser.
[106:43.27]When I get a new weapon for Bowser, yes.
[106:45.99]But his current weapon right now, uh... Hurts everybody's eyes.
[106:50.02]That's the sad truth.
[106:56.32]Alright.
[107:01.06]Didn't get it.
[107:05.44]Got it.
[107:06.12]Yes!
[107:06.78]Okay, how are we doing on health?
[107:07.84]Not great.
[107:18.15]What am I gonna do with stream points?
[107:20.27]I'll figure out something.
[107:23.41]I don't think I even have access to them right now.
[107:25.29]Aren't they in, like, beta?
[107:33.24]Shit.
[107:37.62]I think I would do something stupid, where... You know, some... Okay, you know, remember when Pepsi had the thing where you could get the jet for, like, a hundred million Pepsi points?
[107:49.13]But what if like, what if like a hundred million Jerm of Twitch points, like I like, I like flew out to like your neighborhood and we like went and got lunch.
[108:00.10]You need to get like a hundred fucking million.
[108:08.12]That's some, that's some bullshit.
[108:10.16]I, I, I come, I come to your house!
[108:19.19]No, that's some, like, Nickelodeon shit.
[108:24.32]Nickelodeon presents Nicktoons!
[108:26.06]Come to your neighborhood!
[108:28.20]I think they did something like that before, didn't they?
[108:29.86]I think they did.
[108:47.71]I think you get 10 points per half hour.
[108:49.69]How long is that?
[108:55.03]That may be like four to five hundred years.
[109:03.16]A hundred million coins and we get to like... miss.
[109:21.47]Bowser, level 19!
[109:25.67]Where to?
[109:31.55]Just pull the coins.
[109:40.12]Once again, chat is split on HP.
[109:43.18]Well, if Bowser is eventually gonna get the Lazy Shell, then...
[109:48.84]I would start focusing on defense.
[109:54.88]But that's just me.
[109:55.74]And it's you picking, so... Okay.
[109:57.14]Ah, come on.
[109:57.94]Frog coin up there.
[110:20.04]Like that.
[110:20.86]Bingo.
[110:21.88]Shit.
[110:22.40]380.
[110:22.50]I gotta take a maple syrup.
[110:26.61]Or do I?
[110:31.63]No, I got a flower jar.
[110:36.83]I'll just use that.
[110:53.07]Go pee?
[110:54.55]Yeah, I will.
[110:55.03]Once I get to the new save point, I will go pee.
[110:57.47]I promise.
[110:59.93]But I gotta get these frog coins first.
[111:05.16]What the hell is this thing?
[111:21.84]Where is it?
[111:23.12]What plane is this on?
[111:24.24]Oh, it was forward.
[111:32.47]Come on, I already killed them.
[111:54.70]Damn it.
[112:32.53]I can't go that way.
[112:36.67]Hey, listen.
[112:38.43]Listen.
[112:39.05]Listen, guys.
[112:39.87]I can't jump from here.
[112:42.55]Okay, there was an invisible wall there.
[112:43.77]I promise.
[112:44.17]I swear to God.
[112:45.07]I swear on everything.
[112:46.57]I do... Rewind.
[112:48.79]I actually tried to jump.
[112:50.07]Did you see it?
[112:50.49]I swear to God.
[112:52.06]Go back.
[112:52.44]Rewind.
[112:57.46]I tried.
[112:58.44]I did.
[112:58.74]I swear to God.
[113:03.22]Uh-oh.
[113:04.76]I wasn't ready for this.
[113:11.85]I tried to jump over there.
[113:12.85]It didn't work.
[113:14.55]I tried.
[113:18.84]You can lucky jewel every single time.
[113:43.04]I bet I haven't used that at every single boss.
[113:47.62]I did not know that.
[113:49.91]This monster is getting furious.
[114:07.02]Get rid of him.
[114:08.91]Gone.
[114:09.03]Nope.
[114:10.83]Shit.
[114:15.43]Va va voom!
[114:16.65]Oh no, wait!
[114:19.27]I think that kills somebody.
[114:20.91]No, it doesn't.
[114:23.44]I have to take a... No, I don't.
[114:26.10]Wait a minute.
[114:29.28]Should I summon Yoshi?
[114:30.44]94, 15.
[114:36.09]I'm going for it.
[114:36.59]This is a bad idea.
[114:37.83]Really stupid, but he'll die right now.
[114:39.27]Yep.
[114:39.69]Okay.
[114:40.65]Once again, defense up.
[114:41.83]We're fine.
[114:43.11]Just block it.
[114:46.92]I have a flower jar.
[114:47.86]I don't want to waste anything.
[115:11.75]Lucky, I didn't even need to use it.
[115:16.79]Killer Crocomar, I just get $50.
[115:20.29]5,000 bits from Killer Crocomar.
[115:22.27]Thank you, Crocomar.
[115:25.15]Huge money drop.
[115:26.31]Big bits.
[115:29.13]Sam and Max died for this, and I'm okay with that.
[115:31.35]As long as you do all the Paper Mario series.
[115:33.94]Also, you better jex it out on Q-Logs.
[115:39.88]Yeah.
[115:40.41]I do want to finish Sam & Max, but... I do.
[115:44.09]I didn't really like Season 3.
[115:45.89]The first episode just didn't do it for me.
[115:50.17]I will finish it.
[115:53.52]Jerma lied about finishing Sam & Max Season 3, Episode 2 through 5.
[115:56.72]Just make the username now.
[115:58.20]Alright, let's double the coins.
[116:00.08]You paying attention?
[116:05.49]Which one?
[116:21.94]I wasn't looking.
[116:22.56]Do it again.
[116:23.02]I'm gonna go with the audience here.
[116:25.46]31% says left.
[116:26.82]Let's go.
[116:27.43]And you got it wrong.
[116:28.41]It's okay.
[116:29.51]We didn't lose anything.
[116:30.57]We tried.
[116:31.13]It was very close.
[116:36.99]I need to use that flower box.
[116:43.71]There it is.
[116:45.55]81.
[116:45.61]Nice.
[116:45.91]Alright.
[116:46.85]I still have to go back to... I gotta bring this to the guy.
[116:51.43]Okay.
[116:52.45]So that means... Let me do this.
[116:53.33]That's fine.
[117:04.07]But am I gonna play Paper Mario?
[117:05.75]I don't know.
[117:07.57]I don't know.
[117:14.22]Alright, time to pee.
[117:14.72]I'll be right back.
[119:51.41]Anybody notice anything weird about Jerma's P this time?
[119:53.75]Yeah, I guess you tell me.
[120:04.06]We're also getting to one of my favorite parts of the whole game.
[120:09.92]And I cannot wait to act it out for you.
[120:31.33]And then we have the series of doors which you guys are gonna pick.
[120:36.25]Lots of chat participation coming up in the next 45 minutes or so.
[121:09.35]No, I wanted to jump.
[121:10.59]I forgot to jump right at the end.
[121:29.62]Here comes the anger Tree Stump is furious The monster's getting furious I forgot to refill my drink I'm so focused on peeing Peach, level 18
[121:59.68]Psych Bomb.
[122:00.96]I'm not sure I've ever used this move.
[122:05.87]Is that the final, uh, is that Peach's final smash?
[122:08.67]Alright.
[122:11.55]Flower, or, I wish I could click the flower.
[122:30.43]Maybe it would give him something.
[122:42.78]Go underneath the frog, stone frog?
[122:44.62]Can I do it?
[122:46.33]Can I go underneath the stone frog?
[122:48.49]Lift up, stone frog, whatever.
[123:03.22]Let's get rid of you.
[123:03.92]Can I?
[123:04.26]You know what?
[123:05.27]Psych bomb.
[123:06.47]Let's do it.
[123:10.79]Alright.
[123:18.30]Why does Peach have bombs?
[123:21.40]Migraine.
[123:32.55]I think that does all of their health.
[123:34.13]We're gonna have to check in on that.
[123:36.71]Oh, another one of these?
[123:42.02]Yeah.
[123:42.74]Dammit.
[123:44.58]Special... Did I land on the thing?
[123:55.63]Or... Goddammit.
[123:56.65]It's alright.
[123:56.99]Genoblast.
[123:57.97]Genoflash!
[123:58.61]Let's go.
[124:07.04]Everybody.
[124:08.90]In one go, let's see it.
[124:11.64]Oh, that always feels good.
[124:12.88]18 for Mallow.
[124:23.73]Star Rain.
[124:24.95]Mallow's final move.
[124:29.85]How close am I to the end?
[124:32.02]Um, this is the second to last, well, no, this is the three, there's two more areas after this area.
[124:39.72]Technically.
[124:41.34]So.
[124:42.93]We're at about the 85 percentile through the game.
[124:48.01]We're nearing the end of the game, yes.
[124:51.31]We're late again.
[124:57.19]Let me sleep.
[124:59.83]The stream just started two hours ago.
[125:07.11]Let me sleep!
[125:08.25]Ah, shit.
[125:09.31]Here we go.
[125:11.25]It's 4 a.m.
[125:11.89]here.
[125:13.67]Well, it's like 5.30 here.
[125:17.23]P.M.
[125:40.83]Let me sleep.
[125:42.51]I'm so tired.
[125:54.33]Big bits.
[125:55.07]More big bits.
[125:56.13]More.
[125:58.81]More.
[126:02.87]550 bucks from Killer Crocomire.
[126:05.37]That's 100 bucks from Killer Crocomire so far.
[126:09.00]Crocomire?
[126:10.82]Big money.
[126:12.82]Huge cash drop.
[126:14.88]Shit, I was trying to do something sneaky.
[126:21.47]And they say, uh, don't act like you didn't evade that Paper Mario question.
[126:27.21]Oh, if I was... Didn't I say I was probably not gonna do it?
[126:31.30]I think I said that, like, a couple of streams ago, maybe?
[126:36.50]I don't have any plans to play Paper Mario.
[126:38.00]Let's just put it that way.
[126:39.66]So... But I didn't have any plans to play this, did I?
[126:44.21]Somebody actually said that I said I was gonna... The only reason why I would stream this game is if I had, like, a mental breakdown or something, right?
[126:52.79]I never planned on ever thinking I was gonna do this.
[126:55.29]So, I don't know.
[126:57.34]Uh, evading the quest... I just said the answer was probably no.
[127:02.30]That's me answering the question.
[127:05.04]Evading the question would be, are you going to play Paper Mario?
[127:09.02]And then I say, well, you know, it actually is supposed to be raining.
[127:13.91]I think it's supposed to rain tomorrow.
[127:18.07]And then I just go back to normal.
[127:21.49]That's it.
[127:30.04]Stop evading the question.
[127:31.58]Barrio's... Oh, good for Barrio.
[127:35.46]He's now level 20.
[127:36.02]They also say, keep up the good content and hope you do the dunk tank stream before winter rolls in.
[127:41.67]I'm not sure if you've been here, but September 21st is not just going to be a dunk tank.
[127:46.37]It's going to be like a six-hour carnival with a shitload of chat-controlled carnival games.
[127:52.53]September 21st, hope to see you there.
[127:58.57]But thank you.
[127:59.55]Seriously, Crocomar.
[128:01.59]That's a lot of fucking money.
[128:03.00]Too much money.
[128:12.79]Rose and dunk tank?
[128:14.33]Nah, it'll be too cold to do it then.
[128:28.59]Oh wait, 9?
[128:29.43]13?
[128:30.50]No.
[128:34.02]I feel like you guys don't care about this anymore.
[128:37.54]Because once we've gone majority clicking right flower, I think that I should just start picking these.
[128:43.35]Because, like, that's majority right flower.
[128:49.29]I think the novelty may have worn off.
[128:54.45]Hold on, I think Otto is like, is Otto trying to get in here?
[128:58.28]Hold on.
[129:40.81]Okay.
[129:42.09]Sorry about that.
[129:43.75]I just heard him bark.
[129:44.51]He was barking at my bedroom door.
[129:47.31]Not here.
[129:49.70]Because the bedroom door was closed and he wanted to go and lie down in his bed in the bedroom.
[129:55.24]Bowser at 152, 153 attack.
[129:57.26]Sounds pretty good.
[130:11.35]You probably could have heard that.
[130:14.71]Usually I can get away with a full burp under my breath, but everything was quiet, and you probably just heard that completely.
[130:23.36]I need a... It was like, cue the music to zero.
[130:31.94]Hopefully nobody heard it.
[130:43.46]Oh, okay.
[130:44.52]Backfire.
[130:46.22]Ow.
[131:18.81]I want, like, another coffee.
[131:20.69]I'm gonna have to feel like that.
[131:22.75]Anybody have to feel like they want two coffees?
[131:26.02]Ultra Flame!
[131:26.78]There it is.
[131:27.22]I think today might be a two.
[131:35.08]It's like five.
[131:36.42]It's like six o'clock.
[131:40.95]You can't drink coffee after six.
[131:43.65]You can't.
[131:44.19]Like, that's bad.
[131:46.62]Alright.
[131:48.54]That is too late.
[131:49.60]I'll go get, like, a water.
[131:51.87]Next break.
[131:58.03]Alright, if right flower click becomes more than 50%, I'm gonna start just picking these.
[132:08.82]Green tea.
[132:09.92]You know what?
[132:10.38]That's right, I could just get tea.
[132:27.23]What do we have the tea here?
[132:28.35]I wonder I think I have some green tea Alright, well I'm gonna start picking my uh my own stuff then Because I mean that's just too that's too much hey Hey there

[135:18.11]Royal Syrup is like a full... Pick me a Bracer.
[135:21.23]Probably use that soon.
[135:23.41]Yoshi Cookie, I haven't used it.
[135:25.95]The Bright Card, what the hell am I... I gotta get rid of these three.
[135:28.40]I gotta go to the Mushroom Guy after this.
[135:34.68]Pure Water?
[135:36.36]Yeah, I'll get rid of this.
[135:37.46]I'm not gonna use it.
[135:38.88]That's why I care.
[135:41.11]I got some maximum.
[135:41.75]I'm going to get a couple mid-mushrooms.
[135:46.95]Just in case I don't use peach.
[135:50.03]Mid-mushroom, maple syrup.
[135:52.61]That's fine.
[135:53.03]That's good.
[135:53.65]We're fine.
[135:57.16]Alright.
[135:59.38]We've got a pretty cool collection over here.
[136:02.14]If you didn't know, here's a little bit of a gamer trivia.
[136:06.18]Here's the Star Fox.
[136:07.98]Um...
[136:09.62]The Star Fox, the Arwing.
[136:12.05]Cool.
[136:12.95]Then you got F-Zero.
[136:14.93]Pretty cool.
[136:16.25]And... I don't know what this is.
[136:18.69]I have no idea.
[136:25.71]What's the one on the way to the right?
[136:30.20]Metroid ship?
[136:31.44]I don't think I've ever seen what the outside of the Metroid ship looks like.
[136:35.43]I didn't really play that much Metroid.
[136:36.98]I really didn't.
[136:38.38]I was a fan of some of it, but not all of it.
[136:40.84]What?
[136:42.72]I don't know.
[136:43.06]I just tried to pretend I cared about that franchise, but I do.
[136:45.56]But I don't.
[136:46.04]But I do.
[136:46.86]Because it's a cool franchise.
[136:47.94]Alright, here we go.
[136:49.99]First try.
[137:12.31]It's Yoshi!
[137:13.25]It's Fire Yoshi!
[137:17.96]The Tsar Dragon!
[137:22.48]Why do I have two saves?
[137:23.38]Because I freaked out.
[137:27.30]I did play Metroid Prime.
[137:29.52]But... I don't... I didn't play very much of it.
[137:37.03]No, that fucking hurts.
[137:37.85]I didn't dodge that.
[137:40.30]Alright, here we go.
[137:41.08]I'm gonna do Ultra Flame on the Flame Dragon.
[137:43.54]That would be a stupid idea.
[137:44.68]I'm going for it!
[137:45.24]30 jumps, right now!
[137:57.21]Nope.
[137:57.77]Not even close.
[138:17.01]Tsar means emperor in Russian.
[138:30.68]Oh.
[138:30.80]240 damage.
[138:32.72]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[138:35.52]I'm gonna get it!
[138:36.84]Here we go, let's get it!
[138:40.04]Oh!
[138:51.56]fire type having a water type move.
[138:54.40]Stupid.
[138:54.90]God damn it.
[139:16.02]It's so hard.
[139:16.90]Fuck.
[139:25.48]You're never going to get between 15 and 20.
[139:27.68]It takes this hyper zen-like way to focus.
[139:37.05]Imagine doing 100 of those.
[139:43.29]I didn't block that again.
[139:44.27]Alright, come on.
[139:48.57]Please.
[139:49.59]Please.
[140:05.83]I don't understand.
[140:06.97]I'm doing it, like, the second it hits, like... What's the most I had?
[140:10.15]20?
[140:10.17]That was good, I just got that out of the way.
[140:14.09]Alright.
[140:49.08]God damn it!
[140:50.32]I'm getting so mad about this.
[140:53.36]It's so ridiculous.
[140:54.68]Oh!
[140:54.98]I think we can die if I'm not careful here.
[141:17.63]Okay, I'm gonna take my headphones out.
[141:20.71]It can be super jump too.
[141:21.65]Alright, headphones coming out.
[141:23.17]I'm just doing it by sight only.
[141:24.51]That didn't work.
[141:30.21]That was not good.
[141:30.99]That didn't work.
[141:33.55]It's alright.
[141:40.25]I don't even care.
[141:52.04]Nooo, just heal yourself.
[142:13.34]What the fuck?
[142:14.78]I can't do it without the- I gotta put the headphones back in.
[142:17.62]Shit, man.
[142:19.11]That's so hard.
[142:50.03]It's 15 every fucking time!
[142:51.65]One thing I've never achieved in this game is that.
[143:11.84]I've never been able to do it.
[143:24.83]I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna like jump with the motherfucker, I swear to God.
[143:43.28]Get fit with Mario.
[143:47.13]Here we go.
[143:47.81]No, I can't even do it.
[143:49.27]I used all my points.
[143:51.54]Desperately trying to achieve it.
[143:53.50]374, that's insane.
[144:13.65]I did it!
[144:14.93]Got the star.
[144:19.09]Getting close.
[144:20.03]Only one more to go.
[144:30.36]I'll be taking that, thank you.
[144:33.44]Huh?
[144:40.69]Hmph!
[144:42.11]We got the star!
[144:45.61]Now we're amazing!
[144:49.86]We're unbeatable!
[144:53.52]We're gorgeous!
[144:56.90]You'd better leave now, chumps!
[145:05.51]Get back here!
[145:12.51]Hey, Rhett!
[145:13.47]Look down there!
[145:14.63]That's gonna be the ugliest mustache I've ever seen!
[145:18.49]Ew, gross!
[145:20.88]That guy's worse looking than that Claude Mario!
[145:24.82]That is Mario, you idiot!
[145:27.84]Listen, everyone!
[145:28.86]We gotta get this star out of the blade immediately!
[145:31.82]We'll deal with Mario later!
[145:41.35]Hey Red, careful with this.
[145:43.19]You're all thumbs.
[145:44.77]Go!
[145:45.35]One, two, three, four, five.
[146:15.90]Where's the blade?
[146:18.02]He'll be here.
[146:19.84]Are you sure?
[146:21.48]Relax, people.
[146:23.76]Mario's here.
[146:25.96]He's too late.
[146:27.41]Now, where's the blade?
[146:29.77]Shut up already.
[146:32.83]Wrong voice.
[146:34.69]Finally.
[146:41.39]We fight for evil.
[146:44.17]We live for disorder.
[146:46.43]We like what we do.
[146:49.05]We struggle for chaos.
[146:52.21]We are... This Star Piece gives people hope.
[147:05.28]It needs to be destroyed.
[147:06.66]That was all five of them talking at the same time.
[147:12.76]Oh, well that's funny.
[147:13.48]Do you know what?
[147:19.22]Ow!
[147:20.04]Alright, who we going for?
[147:21.88]Who, who, who, who, who?
[147:23.37]Let's go for... Green!
[147:25.13]Uh-oh, Gene's dead.
[147:27.85]Nope, not quite.
[147:49.84]Oh shit, a healer!
[147:51.36]A HEALER!
[147:52.26]I'll teach you how.
[147:57.90]Boom!
[147:58.56]Come back!
[148:15.90]The pick-me-ups are specifically for Peach.
[148:25.85]Thank you.
[148:30.61]He's dead.
[148:31.31]He's gonna hit him again!
[148:33.36]Don't do it!
[148:34.22]Alright, I need a group hug.
[148:41.94]Oh, he's dead again.
[148:46.59]Bad.
[148:47.37]Bad.
[148:47.57]Very bad.
[148:48.17]Very bad.
[148:48.65]They're just gonna pick me up.
[148:49.45]I have to.
[148:50.93]And I'm gonna genoblast again.
[148:59.86]That would've probably killed him.
[149:01.14]Alright, let's go.
[149:02.42]Genoflash.
[149:03.52]Let's fucking just burn them all up.
[149:06.68]Let's take out like two or three more.
[149:17.57]Uh-oh.
[149:21.55]Sleeping?
[149:21.99]It's alright, give her a hug.
[149:23.95]Yo, Red!
[149:25.31]What?
[149:26.93]I broke my shades!
[149:29.25]Serve your right!
[149:29.93]Uh, hey, Red!
[149:33.19]What?
[149:34.83]I've got a headache!
[149:38.25]You're totally out of shape!
[149:51.11]Bad leader.
[149:51.77]Just insults his team.
[149:53.23]This is not good.
[150:00.05]It's okay.
[150:00.98]Do I have any Abel juices?
[150:04.27]Oh, hey, lucky jewel!
[150:05.83]No, no, no, not until I'm almost done.
[150:10.86]Oh.
[150:14.14]Alright, we can take out Ping.
[150:19.87]Just one punch to knock it out.
[150:25.05]Ah, red!
[150:26.51]What?
[150:28.03]My makeup's running!
[150:30.37]Then change brands!
[150:34.95]Ultra Flame.
[150:35.35]Let's do it on... I'm going to do it with Yellow.
[150:38.39]Not very much, but it should be... No, not enough.
[150:42.63]It's a shit brand.
[151:02.12]Alright, get out of there, Peach.
[151:03.36]Come on.
[151:04.90]Mario can't do this on his own.
[151:06.88]In fact, Mario can't do this on his own.
[151:08.50]So Mario's going to do a mid-mushroom.
[151:25.26]Oh, dead.
[151:25.78]No?
[151:26.08]Body slam!
[151:26.38]Now he's dead.
[151:27.12]Okay, Peach, please?
[151:28.34]Peach, recover.
[151:30.12]Okay, thank you.
[151:31.18]Come on back.
[151:53.05]That should be it for you.
[151:59.93]Hey, yo Red!
[152:00.17]What?
[152:00.33]I'm hungry!
[152:00.71]Chew on your tongue!
[152:16.66]You guys really are in, like, shambles as a group.
[152:19.36]Ow.
[152:19.50]That was zero.
[152:23.28]Good.
[152:24.50]And...
[152:45.34]Enough.
[152:46.74]Now I'm angry.
[152:48.84]It's time to finish this.
[152:50.96]Formation, hop!
[152:54.74]Here we go.
[153:00.15]Going after the Transformer here.
[153:05.07]No, I'm gonna keep that.
[153:07.87]Let's just attack.
[153:18.33]oh my god I psyched myself up force beam energized maximum charge now fire the breaker breaker beam I feel like I think I remember this is bad it is very bad almost one hit kills everybody
[154:09.06]Did I do it?
[154:24.57]How many was that?
[154:25.13]How many was that?
[154:25.69]How many was that?
[154:26.24]How many?
[154:26.70]Is that a lot?
[154:28.52]Did I do it?
[154:29.02]Is that 30?
[154:29.24]Did I do it?
[154:31.98]I did it!
[154:33.32]Oh, I did it!
[154:36.56]I did it.
[154:36.86]Retro- 36?
[154:40.03]Oh, shit.
[154:41.87]Alright.
[154:42.85]Nice.
[154:44.80]Wow.
[154:47.08]I did it.
[154:52.80]Now get a hungry.
[154:54.26]That's the next step.
[154:56.70]You have to just, like, zone out.
[154:59.68]Uh, I need to.
[155:04.78]Let's get some apples.
[155:08.46]Everybody at full health?
[155:11.89]Uh-oh.
[155:12.17]I don't know.
[155:12.63]Is everybody... This might kill everybody.
[155:14.47]Is everybody healed?
[155:15.07]Uh-oh.
[155:15.29]That was... Alright, that was... Could have been pretty bad.
[155:18.87]Group hug.
[155:20.29]Peach may be the best character in the game.
[155:40.73]Recharging.
[155:41.43]I wonder, let me just do like a Geno Flash or something.
[155:44.23]Nah, that's probably not gonna do much.
[155:45.63]Just keep doing basic attacks.
[155:51.01]145 damage this time.
[155:51.83]That's really good.
[155:53.01]Everyone's at full health.
[156:01.02]There it is.
[156:02.50]This isn't possible!
[156:04.78]We are invincible!
[156:10.63]Can this be happening to the Axum Rangers?
[156:16.20]Only 17 experience.
[156:41.97]Hang in there, Axum Rangers.
[156:43.78]Why are you cheering on the bad guy?
[156:48.98]One left.
[156:54.40]And then those seven combine into one, and then you need to do that six more times.
[157:02.01]Six star pieces have finally been collected.
[157:04.55]Where could that last star piece be?
[157:20.73]alright now we can do a couple of things there's one or two things I need to clean up first before we continue on to the end game oh I need to go to where's the mushroom guy
[157:52.21]Which town was Mushroom Guy in?
[157:56.35]Moleville?
[157:58.11]Marymoor?
[157:59.59]I don't remember.
[158:00.05]Seaside Town?
[158:01.19]I think it's Seaside Town.
[158:05.88]Am I going to get the Lazy Shell?
[158:10.18]Got it.
[158:14.58]I think it was over here, because it was the other side, this way.
[158:18.44]Mushroom Boy!
[158:20.93]You have any mushrooms?
[158:21.75]I do.
[158:23.01]Hey, you don't have any mushrooms.
[158:24.30]What the fuck are you talking about?
[158:32.26]Come on.
[158:34.68]Is this the guy?
[158:37.20]I could've... Okay.
[158:57.47]Let's see if we can make you look a little more snazzy.
[159:01.27]No, that's not.
[159:01.87]So I'm just going to get rid of these then.
[159:07.05]I thought we could use these over here.
[159:12.55]Uh, I know I can do something in Mobile.
[159:13.69]Uh, right.
[159:25.10]I think I can, there's like my egg, right?
[159:26.94]The mystery egg now.
[159:28.02]I can give to this guy?
[159:30.18]I can sell something to him.
[159:32.66]Good to see you again.
[159:33.46]I'll show you my inventory.
[159:34.40]A metal plate.
[159:37.12]Don't know what it's used for, but I'll sell it for 300 coins.
[159:40.54]I'll take it.
[159:41.04]Nice doing business with you.
[159:43.98]That's all I got.
[159:49.59]I think that is... There it is.
[159:54.71]The Fryin' Pan.
[159:57.54]There's Peach's best weapon, I believe.
[160:04.23]It's a PUBG frying pan.
[160:08.45]Yep.
[160:17.21]I think that's all I can do here.
[160:18.75]This guy doesn't have anything else.
[160:21.97]Didn't- I have no inventory, okay.
[160:25.81]Am I gonna fight the Final Fantasy boss?
[160:27.11]Yes.
[160:29.94]The carbo- I remember this is incredibly convoluted.
[160:32.82]The carbo cookie.
[160:34.36]You go- you actually can get a carbo cookie.
[160:37.08]You go through this really annoying process to get a carbo cookie.
[160:40.10]It's like trading a bunch of shit and getting rid of money.
[160:42.59]You give it to this little kid.
[160:45.10]And nothing interesting happens.
[160:48.59]You actually can just... I mean, spoiler alert.
[160:53.33]She gets off the bucket.
[160:55.57]And then you can go in the bucket.
[160:57.15]And I think it just takes her to the river.
[161:02.20]I forget how to even do the Cargo Cookie.
[161:05.08]Would you like a shiny stone?
[161:06.24]No.
[161:11.91]But it means you helped her.
[161:15.62]Figure it out.
[161:16.62]Figure it out.
[161:20.16]Hold on.
[161:20.68]I gotta keep the game progression going.
[161:28.03]If you help her, it sets off fireworks.
[161:30.23]Oh yeah, the end credits.
[161:31.11]If you do the five secrets right.
[161:32.60]Alright, let's go up here.
[161:35.38]Let's do this.
[161:35.86]Figure it out, you idiot.
[161:41.57]Alright, let's sell some stuff.
[161:42.69]Let's restock.
[161:44.59]And get on with it, right?
[161:48.75]Gorefan.
[161:49.59]Imagine I sold that.
[161:50.87]That's the thing about these old games on old consoles.
[161:55.21]If I were to accidentally just press A, that's it.
[161:57.69]I would have to reload and save.
[162:01.66]Megapants.
[162:02.26]Get rid of these.
[162:03.10]Keep the work pants in case I want to.
[162:04.66]Fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy.
[162:07.28]First, these can stay.
[162:15.38]I'll get another couple maple syrups.
[162:20.14]I want at least two pick-me-ups, because you've got to be careful.
[162:25.72]Give Peach the lazy shell, I'm begging you.
[162:36.17]I'm about to sell the damn lazy shell.
[162:39.34]If you don't have patience with me.
[162:45.48]30 jumps, right.
[162:45.86]I've got to go back to Macho Town.
[162:46.74]You won't do it.
[162:59.26]No, I won't, because that's the crutch.
[163:01.80]If I can't beat Kulex.
[163:08.53]Just can't seem to find the casino.
[163:09.85]I'm so tired.
[163:11.09]I've been walking around all day.
[163:20.06]Come to Great Guy Casino.
[163:21.36]Three jumps and a bright card will get you in.
[163:23.30]Sorry, but no chomps allowed.
[163:27.49]Three jumps, a bright card, and no chomps.
[163:29.25]What is this?
[163:30.45]I already know that.
[163:31.25]I already know that.
[163:34.55]Thanks, Colbert.
[163:42.30]You guys are the fucking Colbert bullshit.
[163:53.09]Let's go back to Monstro Town.
[163:56.67]And get our item for doing 30 jumps.
[163:59.32]And then we have to do 100.
[164:14.04]No, I don't want to go in there.
[164:16.40]I don't want to go in there.
[164:17.74]Don't go in there.
[164:20.80]I heard your record for jumping stands at 35 right now.
[164:23.98]Wow, you did it.
[164:24.60]You made it over 30 jumps.
[164:26.06]Here's your prize.
[164:26.74]Attack scarf.
[164:33.09]This thing is insane, by the way.
[164:38.29]Look at this thing.
[164:42.03]So comfy, it'll make you jump.
[164:46.04]So now, I can... Feather or... Geno, I like speed on Geno.
[165:00.62]Actually no, speed on Peach is better, because you can just do more stuff.
[165:07.34]Now the real impossible, destructive play here is Attack Scarf, Lazy Shell.
[165:21.43]Where's the laser shell?
[165:25.39]I sold it.
[165:27.47]I sold it and I saved the game.
[165:30.14]Oh my god.
[165:32.04]Okay.
[165:37.94]What do you got for a ghost medal?
[165:39.52]Maybe I should give the ghost medal to Gino.
[165:42.28]Because the amulet's kind of old at this point.
[165:45.41]Let's give... Hmm...
[165:49.95]Yeah, let's do it.
[165:51.89]Hey, thank you, JermaSucks, for the five community subs.
[165:54.06]Appreciate that.
[165:59.80]Thanks for the five subs.
[166:04.06]Ooh, you know what I can do, though?
[166:05.52]Here's what I can do.
[166:07.85]It's sensei time.
[166:11.53]I think I might be okay.
[166:12.89]This might be worth trying again.
[166:20.06]Because I've leveled up like four or five times.
[166:28.91]You also get another insane item.
[166:30.27]Let's try this again.
[166:31.71]You wish to challenge me?
[166:32.41]Yes.
[166:35.67]Let's see if I can do it.
[166:42.67]106.
[166:42.69]Good.
[166:43.17]That's a good start.
[166:48.88]Frying pan.
[166:53.43]Zero, that's good.
[166:55.09]Oh, fuck.
[166:56.85]Alright, it doesn't- didn't instantly kill him.
[166:59.23]That's good.
[167:00.31]That's not a bad thing.
[167:05.97]I have enough to take one hit.
[167:12.08]Mario's gonna be the one doing all the damage.
[167:19.68]I missed it.
[167:20.64]Sorry.
[167:21.58]Triple kick!
[167:24.67]Zero.
[167:24.97]Good.
[167:25.51]Perfect blocks.
[167:26.67]Perfect.
[167:30.16]Let's see how much damage she... That's not good at all.
[167:34.24]Alright, we're gonna have to play supportive roles here.
[167:37.00]And we're going for 100 jumps right now.
[167:38.36]I'm gonna get it right now, guaranteed.
[167:42.43]I was just talking, that's why I bumped it up.
[167:45.85]We just gave a lot of subs, hold on.
[167:54.44]Nocturne.
[167:55.96]Thank you, Nocturne Acetern, for the 20 community subs.
[168:01.22]Thank you.
[168:03.88]That's a huge sub drop.
[168:08.57]Thanks a lot.
[168:13.55]Congratulations to all of you that got one.
[168:19.28]Really appreciate that, though.
[168:20.65]That's a shitload of subs.
[168:22.65]A lot of people are fucking subbing.
[168:24.99]Even just like tier one.
[168:25.97]I know we make the jokes about the whole September thing, but there's a lot of people that sub today already.
[168:30.41]Just straight up.
[168:32.05]So, thank you guys.
[168:33.57]Guaranteed here it is.
[168:34.29]Fucking knocking the fucker off.
[168:53.78]Damn it!
[168:54.18]I fucking had it.
[168:54.80]I had it.
[169:01.36]You know what I have to do?
[169:01.98]I have to lean back in my fucking chair.
[169:05.23]I gotta lean back in my chair and just stare at the wall.
[169:20.72]I'm gonna go for it.
[169:21.46]I'm gonna try it each time.
[169:22.34]Let's see if I can get close.
[169:23.06]If I can do over 50.
[169:23.66]No, there's no way I'm gonna do 100.
[169:28.14]I'm leaning fucking back.
[169:40.06]No.
[169:40.60]No.
[169:41.00]No.
[169:41.34]Not in the zen mode.
[169:48.05]That one frame.
[169:49.09]I gotta catch it.
[169:51.04]How did I do thirty fucking five?
[169:52.60]I have no idea.
[169:56.02]Ooh.
[169:56.26]Okay, let's group up?
[169:58.80]Yeah.
[170:16.00]It's very hard.
[170:17.14]Oh, yeah, it is.
[170:20.44]240.
[170:20.72]Uh-oh, good thing I had those pick-me-ups, because that's what I- that's why I wanted them.
[170:33.32]No, just get rid of it.
[170:34.34]Just do this.
[170:35.00]I'm not gonna waste the materials.
[170:37.18]Whew!
[170:38.90]Simply amazing!
[170:42.14]Whoa.
[170:46.09]You are stronger, champion.
[170:49.05]No doubt about it.
[170:50.78]My reputation was staked on this last fight, so I've lost the title of sensei.
[170:57.28]From today, you are the sensei of this dojo.
[171:01.82]Please take this belt, which only the highest ranking fighter in the dojo can wear.
[171:09.53]Good.
[171:10.29]Good for you.
[171:10.85]You did it.
[171:11.25]You got a jinx belt.
[171:12.09]Nice job.
[171:13.91]We will rename the dojo Mario Style Dojo and incorporate your jump technique into the training.
[171:28.90]Jacker and I will start our training immediately.
[171:30.88]1,000 Warp Up Jumps.
[171:34.84]Ready?
[171:35.86]Begin!
[171:38.38]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[171:46.14]That's so cute.
[171:46.78]Alright, so now we have the Jinx Belt.
[171:50.04]Which is a huge amount of attack and defense.
[171:58.32]Probably better than both of these.
[171:59.68]Although I wonder if the Feather is better than the Trooper Pen.
[172:10.58]Give her the shell!
[172:13.84]No.
[172:17.68]No.
[172:17.98]Give it to her right now.
[172:28.97]I'm not... Just wait.
[172:30.49]We don't need it yet.
[172:32.85]You want me to break the game?
[172:34.19]I'll break the game eventually.
[172:35.99]But we're doing a blind playthrough.
[172:43.30]Supported by 500 attempts where I was a- 500 times.
[172:47.78]Alright, let's get out of here.
[172:51.04]I got my jinx belt.
[172:52.68]Cleaned up the stuff I needed to do here.
[172:54.31]Got the attack scarf, so I am good to go.
[172:57.43]Okay.
[173:01.73]It's time to go to the final arc of the video game.
[173:15.19]We are encroaching on the final probably hour or two.
[173:20.65]Depends on how badly I get destroyed by QoS.
[173:27.78]That's such an ENFP thing to say.
[173:29.58]I have no idea what the flying fuck you're talking about.
[173:36.28]But, alright.
[173:40.84]Let's go talk to the king.
[173:52.57]ENFP pants.
[173:55.19]ENFP pants moment.
[174:06.24]And... we did it!
[174:07.26]What was this voice again?
[174:10.79]Mom!
[174:11.11]Dad!
[174:13.51]Were you able to find the star, dear?
[174:16.09]Yeah.
[174:16.83]The Axe and Rangers took it away from us, but we got it back again.
[174:20.98]Well, that was much wonderful.
[174:22.72]Now the star, all stopping, can be repaired, right?
[174:28.22]I guess not.
[174:28.76]You're still missing a piece, I take it.
[174:32.92]The last star?
[174:34.34]Wait.
[174:35.52]The only place left to look is in Bowser's Keep.
[174:39.52]Yeah, we know.
[174:40.67]But there's no way to get in.
[174:41.75]Believe me, we tried.
[174:45.12]Yes, yes, even Mario can't jump that far.
[174:49.62]Alright, I'll let you use... That's it, dear.
[174:56.06]You should use the royal bus.
[175:00.52]Yes, well, the time has come for you two to make the bus.
[175:07.01]Why, when I was your age... Really?
[175:10.83]Are you sure it's alright?
[175:13.93]Of course, dear.
[175:14.95]I've ordered the repairman to have it fixed by the time you leave.
[175:19.75]You simply have to help Mario and the others get that last star.
[175:24.53]You bet, Mom.
[175:25.99]Come on, Mario.
[175:27.15]Let's go.
[175:27.53]500 male voices, one female voice.
[175:32.81]Yeah?
[175:44.10]Alright.
[175:51.39]How do I rectify that?
[176:03.83]I have... I... I... It's either this.
[176:07.79]This.
[176:08.87]This.
[176:09.15]This.
[176:12.59]Well, I... What do you want me to do?
[176:18.31]Yes.
[176:19.02]Oh, hi.
[176:19.86]Hey, it's me.
[176:20.80]Fucking hey.
[176:22.40]I'm apparently doing a female voice right now.
[176:27.06]What do you want me to do?
[176:36.63]The bus has finally been repaired.
[176:38.89]We can start operating again.
[176:43.12]Oh, Prince Mallow!
[176:45.48]We want to go to Bowser's Keep.
[176:46.66]Could you give us a little piece?
[176:49.72]I've heard the story from King Nimbus.
[176:51.78]You'll be there in no time.
[176:58.17]Here it comes, here it comes!
[177:10.58]How's the engine running?
[177:12.60]It's pouring like a kit.
[177:16.06]Did you take Prince Mallow to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?
[177:19.77]Of course.
[177:21.03]I can't wait to get this thing running again.
[177:23.87]Come, Prince.
[177:24.55]Hop on board.
[177:34.42]All aboard.
[177:36.56]We're off.
[177:40.95]That's just Pac-Man with a mustache on.
[177:42.82]And he rips it off, and it goes... Pac-Man joins the battle!
[177:46.42]Are they gonna make it?
[178:09.20]Are they gonna make it?
[178:10.38]Are they gonna make it?
[178:11.44]Are they gonna make it?
[178:12.38]Are they gonna make it?
[178:13.40]I'm trying to figure out more voices to do.
[178:16.48]You know what I mean?
[178:19.53]Ah, the scent of boiling lava.
[178:21.57]It's so nice to be home.
[178:23.35]Smithy's gonna pay for stealing my splendid castle from me.
[178:46.28]Oh, dude, everybody is so pumped up.
[178:48.11]Everyone's so leveled up and pumped up.
[178:50.85]I love it.
[178:56.11]Why did you tell Nintendo to put Sans in Smash?
[179:04.64]Guys, the last time I used my Twitter... Um...
[179:11.25]I was talking about how I dropped my fucking pajama pants drawstrings in the toilet.
[179:16.42]When did I do this?
[179:17.30]When did you think I did this?
[179:25.04]Good dodge.
[179:33.93]Ooh.
[179:35.13]Ooh.
[180:01.13]Here comes the launch!
[180:02.23]Alright, here we go!
[180:05.83]No, I fucked it up.
[180:08.11]The catacombs were there before, I have no idea.
[180:12.33]I must have just gotten locked in.
[180:38.79]I don't want to miss any secrets.
[180:55.10]Ooh.
[180:57.10]Zero.
[180:58.49]I want to get it so bad, but I've never been able to do it.
[181:01.03]In my whole life, I've never been able to do it.
[181:03.83]It's so sad that I can't do it.
[181:11.90]Alright, let me try again.
[181:18.78]Damn it!
[181:21.28]Every time I get to 16, my finger just goes, dude, clicker!
[181:49.51]Oh, my God!
[181:50.65]Oh, my God, it's so hard.
[181:56.45]I got... Because Mario just tries to blend into your brain after like 20, 30 times.
[182:40.58]37?
[182:40.62]Alright, I'm gonna try it one more time.
[183:05.89]I can only press a button on one frame 37 fucking times in a row before I lose my mind.
[183:15.00]What was that?
[183:15.82]An item?
[183:18.58]What'd I get?
[183:33.98]I'm just going to throw this shit away in a minute.
[183:37.40]Do the sound alone?
[183:38.88]I'll try sound alone again.
[183:41.72]I actually had the headphones out for that one.
[183:43.07]When I did 37.
[183:43.83]Croco!
[183:44.51]Uh-oh.
[184:00.02]Hey, Mario.
[184:02.48]Did you remember to use a save point?
[184:04.64]There's plenty of danger up ahead, so it's best to save now.
[184:08.44]You need anything?
[184:09.80]I got some items to sell.
[184:13.13]The heel turn.
[184:15.77]The heel to face turn.
[184:26.68]Chat, don't tell him his webcam is on.
[184:31.03]That'd be fucking funny.
[184:35.35]Is this on?
[184:36.07]Alright, I'm getting rid of these.
[184:38.71]Maple syrup.
[184:40.03]Alright, I'm gonna get some...
[184:56.24]Just in case.
[184:57.82]Yeah.
[184:58.42]Alright.
[185:00.50]Alright.
[185:03.54]Your webcam is on and it's pointed at your mushy feet.
[185:12.95]Mushy feet?
[185:15.49]What the fuck?
[185:21.59]that's supposed to mean welcome to there are six doors do you need an explanation uh sure why not for all of you of the six doors two open into action courses you can handle a lot of action right two others will lead you to battle courses and you're good fighting right
[185:50.21]The last two opened onto puzzle courses.
[185:52.65]No sweat for a great puzzle solver like you.
[185:55.39]Right?
[185:56.77]Good puzzle solver.
[185:59.47]Once you choose a course, there's no turning back.
[186:03.39]You get only one way.
[186:04.73]The only way to know what's behind the door is to walk through it.
[186:09.26]You must pass four of the six courses to move on.
[186:13.48]Good luck.
[186:13.96]You're going to need it, I know.
[186:15.52]Just trust me.
[186:21.88]Which door do you want me to do?
[186:24.68]This is actually going to be harder than I thought.
[186:27.29]This is going to be harder than I thought.
[186:29.37]Shit.
[186:29.63]Alright, let's do... Fuck.
[186:31.59]Actually, I don't know if we can do this.
[186:49.18]Because I can't really zoom in, because... I have to, like... Hold on.
[186:55.66]This is gonna be a pain in the ass, but I'm gonna do it.
[187:02.04]There you go.
[187:03.16]Where are we going?
[187:16.91]Which door?
[187:18.81]Choose wisely.
[187:45.37]so so
[188:22.91]What are you guys clicking?
[188:23.75]What are you doing?
[188:30.57]Alright, looks like we're going five.
[188:37.78]Into five we go, but now I have to fix this.
[188:41.14]This is what I was afraid of.
[188:59.43]Okay, five.
[189:02.16]Hey, hey, hey, it's me, the Quizmaster, and it's quiz time.
[189:11.92]Do you need an explanation?
[189:15.34]I'll give you 12, count them, 12 questions.
[189:19.00]If you're right, the block you're standing on will move up one, but if you blow it, you got down two.
[189:25.59]You have five seconds.
[189:28.55]If you can't answer, you'll move down.
[189:31.73]Reach the eighth step within 12 questions and you've won.

[190:03.15]Mulville, Forest Bay, Star Hill.
[190:05.25]Mulville.

[192:00.92]46, final answer.
[192:10.28]Piece of cake!
[192:14.16]Uh-oh.
[192:15.24]Now for something completely different!
[192:18.23]Boo, Goo, Bones, and Kip completed in a triathlon.
[192:23.13]The triathlon included swimming, cycling, and a marathon.
[192:27.89]It's up to you to guess
[192:29.92]Which place each person came in?
[192:32.40]Listen well, you're only going to hear the story once.
[192:42.37]I came in third place for swimming.
[192:45.95]So Boo, third place for swimming.
[192:50.05]I came in third place for swimming.
[192:53.06]Goo, I out rode Bones on my bike and Bones was never able to pass me.
[193:02.13]Boo, third swimming, Goo, passed Bones on cycling.
[193:08.95]And Bones was never able to pass.
[193:12.61]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[193:20.49]Okay, so this is third.
[193:21.41]Hold on.
[193:22.79]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but finally ended up in the same place.
[193:26.81]He was in fourth place, fourth of the bike race.
[193:29.27]Goo was third place in the bike race.
[193:31.44]He might have been second, though, just because he didn't pass him doesn't mean anything.
[193:37.92]But finally ended up in the same... Okay, what about Fish?
[193:41.12]I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events, but two others beat me in the marathon.
[193:49.63]I came in third for swimming.
[193:52.37]I fell into fourth... Okay.
[193:58.07]So he's fourth, so fourth in both.
[194:04.31]So he's in fourth place.
[194:06.37]He's in third place for swimming.
[194:10.20]I out Rowan's bonus, my bike.
[194:11.66]Okay.
[194:12.32]What about you?
[194:12.66]What did you do?
[194:15.16]So I use your, okay.
[194:15.82]So you're first.
[194:19.32]No, two others beat me in the marathon.
[194:21.70]Are you first?
[194:34.56]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[194:45.75]But finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[194:49.20]But what about the marathon?
[194:59.71]I think the fish is first or second.
[195:02.74]Two others beat me in the marathon.
[195:03.76]So, where did you go in the marathon?
[195:07.37]What did you do in the marathon?
[195:12.13]We only have one piece of evidence for the marathon.
[195:21.90]Yeah, two others beat me, so you're in either third or fourth place.
[195:26.80]For the marathon.
[195:31.53]That's the only information we have.
[195:32.83]So who won the marathon?
[195:42.16]Hold on.
[195:42.54]I'm going to draw this.
[195:43.48]I have to draw this.
[195:56.18]Hold on.
[196:02.83]Give me one second.
[196:03.49]I actually do have to, like, write this out.
[196:05.97]I have to put this on another monitor, though.
[196:12.31]Okay, so... Let's go back here.
[196:20.70]I don't want to lose this, because I'll lose.
[196:28.99]And I don't want to restart it.
[196:34.76]Okay, so let's do, let me get this right.
[196:38.96]Let's get paint captured so you can see it.
[196:40.82]Might as well.
[196:47.19]Paint.
[196:48.87]Okay.
[196:54.29]Here.
[196:56.45]Alright, so.
[197:02.65]So we got three events, right?
[197:07.15]So we have marathon, swimming, marathon, and cycling.
[197:27.84]Why is it so huge?
[197:42.30]okay that's fine so swimming so boo came in third for swimming so we're gonna do this one two two okay so swimming so this is boo boo came in third place for swimming
[198:09.10]I out-rode bones on my bike and bones couldn't pass me in cycling.
[198:17.08]Okay.
[198:18.52]I fell into fourth place during the bike race.
[198:20.44]Okay.
[198:29.54]But finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[198:35.48]Fourth place.
[198:38.79]I hate this fucking trick question wording.
[198:41.19]But finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[198:45.23]What do I mean as I did in the swimming event?
[198:51.15]I was in fourth place during the bike race.
[198:54.67]But finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[199:01.76]But where did you place in the swimming event?
[199:03.86]We don't know that.
[199:13.96]So, you know, then you're in fourth.
[199:16.00]You have to be in second place, then.
[199:20.68]Just because you fell into fourth place doesn't... So Goomba wins.
[199:24.08]Goomba won the cycling.
[199:28.42]There's no other alternative.
[199:33.77]It's a trick question bullshit.
[199:42.51]And then, so you're second place in the swimming event.
[199:49.29]There we go, okay.
[199:51.86]So bones, um... I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.
[200:05.56]Hold on, I gotta fucking move these.
[200:07.70]These are all fucked up.
[200:13.68]I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.
[200:17.10]So you're third place.
[200:19.38]So Boo... No, Boo's third place in swimming, so you'd have to be last place.
[200:26.06]So Bones was not last place in the cycling event, so this is... So the two fish came in last in swimming and cycling.
[200:37.63]But Bones said he was in last place.
[200:42.18]No, I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but I finally ended up in the same place as I didn't, so you didn't, you didn't end up in fourth place.
[200:57.81]What is, does Boo have any of, Boo, I came in third for swimming, that's it, we know that.
[201:02.80]I, okay, I out-rode Boo.
[201:06.62]I placed the same in the, in the swimming and cycling events, but, okay.
[201:10.32]Okay.
[201:13.14]Two others beat me in the marathon.
[201:14.54]So you have to be here.
[201:20.95]One of these two places.
[201:22.03]Two people beat you.
[201:24.47]One of these two.
[201:32.41]I got Bones here.
[201:33.23]Bones is second in swimming and cycling.
[201:40.78]If he was fourth, who would be the...
[201:48.86]So then Bones is down here.
[201:54.40]How do I get- I have to delete that.
[201:55.92]That's fucking me up.
[202:06.81]But then who is fourth in cycling?
[202:16.41]Did you win the swimming event?
[202:31.86]so fit so we got fish would be last in cycling because and then so you'd be last in swimming too fish one swimming because he's a fish that doesn't that's not how this works
[203:00.16]The fish is definitely going to be last in swimming.
[203:02.80]So here you go.
[203:03.44]We've deduced it.
[203:04.18]So then now... Boo.
[203:10.47]I got cycling done.
[203:14.99]Use Excel instead.
[203:17.31]I don't even have Excel.
[203:23.11]Fish is last in swimming.
[203:29.68]I'm telling you, it's correct.
[203:33.58]Let me see.
[203:34.78]Fish.
[203:35.83]Let me just look at it.
[203:37.07]Fish is there.
[203:38.25]Is everybody there three times?
[203:48.88]He's a fish.
[203:49.84]But that doesn't matter.
[203:50.60]Alright, I'm going to...
[204:01.02]I think I got it.
[204:03.00]Call me the master.
[204:03.87]Okay.
[204:05.57]In the order they came in.
[204:11.59]This is for the... Okay.
[204:14.12]Let's just fucking guess.
[204:44.84]I looked it up and I googled it and it was wrong.
[204:46.82]I googled it.
[204:47.57]It was a Reddit thread and it was wrong.
[204:49.93]The Reddit thread was wrong.
[205:17.42]Mario won't get up.
[205:18.44]Why won't Mario get up?
[205:20.60]Okay.
[205:23.12]Imagine cheating and losing.
[205:33.77]Okay, let's do it again.
[205:34.95]I gotta do all this shit again.
[205:38.99]Cycling was the second event.
[205:40.47]Yeah.
[205:41.71]Just get this off the fucking screen.
[205:55.56]What's the first monster you see in the pipe vault?
[205:58.42]I don't know.
[205:58.92]I don't remember.
[206:00.54]Sparky, I think?
[206:01.22]Alright, this is... I gotta move this back to normal.
[206:15.43]This is why I didn't want to resize anything.
[206:19.09]What is Rainy's husband's name?
[206:20.89]Raz?
[206:21.34]Yeah.
[206:23.89]Yardovich is what?
[206:25.67]A breed of cattle.
[206:26.53]A boss.
[206:27.97]What technique does Bowser learn at level 15?
[206:29.75]That would be Crusher.
[206:33.18]Fit to screen.
[206:33.98]I don't want to do that because it's capturing.
[206:35.82]I'll show you what happens if I do that.
[206:37.50]Fit to screen does this.
[206:40.16]Because it is an old game being pulled through HDMI.
[206:44.06]The wonders of technology.
[206:52.67]What the fuck is it doing now?
[206:55.90]Okay, what's the name of the sunken ship?
[206:58.14]Johnny.
[207:00.88]What does Balon really like to turn people into?
[207:02.69]Scarecrows.
[207:03.27]A man getting his picture taken.
[207:05.77]A bear boy hates what?
[207:06.57]Getting his picture taken.
[207:09.45]Who is the leader of the Axum Rangers?
[207:11.07]Red.
[207:12.61]Hey.
[207:16.13]Alright, we have to do more counting, I think.
[207:20.97]Time to count.
[207:27.15]Wait, I already did this, right?
[207:29.83]Yeah, I know this one.
[207:31.77]Oh, I think he's gonna change it up.
[207:33.52]Isn't it the same number, though?
[207:40.28]13.
[207:44.89]Was it 13?
[207:45.63]Was it 13 or 14?
[207:46.67]Oh, fuck.
[207:47.15]I think it was 14.
[207:49.17]Okay, that didn't count the one under here.
[208:01.47]Alright, I'm ready.
[208:02.13]43?
[208:02.15]43 or 44?
[208:08.57]44?
[208:08.69]I think it's 44?
[208:31.38]Yeah!
[208:33.57]Now here we are again.
[209:00.01]Oh no, wait, they changed!
[209:02.47]I out-rode Kip on my bike, and Kip was never able to pass me.
[209:06.89]I came in third for swimming.
[209:08.93]No, it's the same thing.
[209:12.25]It's just different people.
[209:13.83]I fell into fourth place during the fight.
[209:15.65]See?
[209:15.77]Oh, the fish is in first place for swimming!
[209:17.61]No.
[209:22.99]Okay.
[209:26.69]Kip is the fish.
[209:32.84]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but finally ended up in the same place I did in the swimming event.
[209:37.63]I'm not cheating.
[209:38.35]You can't cheat.
[209:39.95]Just guess.
[209:40.41]There's a 1 in 4 chance.
[209:41.35]No, there's not.
[209:41.85]It's like a 1 in fucking like 32% chance.
[210:40.69]Alright.
[210:42.94]I don't have Excel.
[210:44.78]I can't use Excel.
[210:45.92]I don't own it.
[210:47.02]Okay, here we go.
[210:47.62]I'm going to do this one.
[210:48.98]I'm going for it.
[210:50.04]Here we go.
[210:51.56]I came in third for swimming.
[210:55.78]I'm just going to write it.
[210:56.42]It doesn't matter.
[210:56.98]It's easy for me to do it like this.
[210:59.10]This is goo.
[211:00.74]Third for swimming.
[211:01.50]That's all I need to know right now.
[211:02.48]I don't care about anything else.
[211:03.96]I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events, but two of those beat me in the marathon.
[211:07.58]Two people beat you in the marathon.
[211:10.69]So that means you have to be in third place for the marathon.
[211:12.60]You have to be.
[211:13.32]If two people beat you in the marathon, that's two and one.
[211:16.52]Bones, you're number three in the marathon.
[211:17.94]Got it.
[211:18.50]Locked in.
[211:24.08]Let me know.
[211:28.50]Three people would have beat you in the marathon if you were in fourth place.
[211:31.14]What are you talking about?
[211:34.08]That's locked in.
[211:38.56]Okay, let's get some more info.
[211:41.53]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but I finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[211:47.77]Bike race, so fourth place in the bike race.
[211:51.07]Wait, what did Boo do?
[211:54.99]I out-rode Kip on my bike, and Kip could never pass me.
[212:06.80]I was in fourth place in the cycling event.
[212:14.12]But I finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[212:17.66]Where did you end up in the swimming event?
[212:20.50]Fourth?
[212:21.20]Third?
[212:21.64]Fourth or second?
[212:22.61]Probably second then, right?
[212:23.51]You had to be second.
[212:27.13]That makes sense.
[212:37.32]So now we've got this info.
[212:41.18]Alright.
[212:45.25]Nice.
[212:45.75]Okay.
[212:46.37]Now, let me know.
[212:57.01]No, second in the marathon.
[212:58.19]Second in the marathon, right?
[213:08.32]Yeah, I wrote it in the wrong place.
[213:09.40]Everybody settle down.
[213:10.74]I wrote it in the wrong place.
[213:11.82]Okay.
[213:20.53]But I finally ended in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[213:26.54]Second fucking place?
[213:27.72]Fourth place?
[213:41.16]I think he is in second place.
[213:42.20]Alright, hold on.
[213:42.60]What about Bowens?
[213:43.16]What about, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[213:44.80]What about Boo?
[213:46.56]I out-road Kip on my bike, and Kip... So you're in first place.
[213:53.26]Or second place.
[213:59.02]Boo has to be in first place.
[213:59.96]You have to be.
[214:08.39]So Boo is in first place in cycling.
[214:11.60]That means Kip.
[214:17.81]Boo could also be second.
[214:19.25]Let's just do that.
[214:22.23]So Kip had to get second.
[214:23.41]So why is everybody screaming at me?
[214:32.10]Kip was fourth in cycling.
[214:33.68]What?
[214:35.31]We are dumb.
[214:36.25]No, what?
[214:38.21]Kip was second.
[214:40.05]I'm going with this.
[214:40.79]Kip is second in everything.
[214:41.99]I agree.
[214:44.05]So that leaves us with what the hell did Bones do?
[214:46.26]I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.
[214:51.54]So fourth place.
[214:56.02]He says he's... No, no, look, look, look.
[214:58.50]I fell into fourth place.
[215:00.42]Don't listen to that bullshit.
[215:01.60]That is a trick.
[215:03.71]I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but I finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.
[215:11.25]That is a fake bullshit.
[215:19.73]Come on, I'm trying, look at it, that's what it says.
[215:23.30]It's a fakeout.
[215:24.56]Don't believe it.
[215:25.62]Now you got me all messed up.
[215:26.82]Where am I going?
[215:28.42]Bones.
[215:29.36]I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.
[215:31.67]What, did we have them over here?
[215:33.67]Okay.
[215:35.59]Two others beat me in the marathon.
[215:37.77]Swimming and cycling events.
[215:40.51]So you're in last place.
[215:42.34]Because then... Goo, what'd you do, Goo?
[215:46.20]I came in third for swimming.
[215:47.42]So yeah, you came in third here, too.
[216:02.76]He can't.
[216:04.76]I out rode Kip on my bike.
[216:06.57]Okay.
[216:08.45]I placed in the same, I placed the same.
[216:15.07]It's a 50-50.
[216:17.38]Two others beat me in the marathon, yeah.
[216:20.50]One, two.
[216:20.72]Not one, two, three.
[216:33.75]Alright.
[216:37.51]Who is in first place in the marathon, then?
[216:39.55]It has to be Boo.
[216:40.70]No.
[216:44.02]I think it is Boo.
[216:50.96]I think it's Boo, Kip, Bones, and then, um, Goo.
[217:01.50]I think that's it.
[217:07.20]I think that's correct.
[217:15.60]I'm going for it.
[217:16.10]Boo, kip, bones, goo.
[217:20.69]Boo.
[217:24.77]Kip.
[217:28.43]Bones.
[217:32.42]Goo.
[218:13.77]Correct.
[218:16.35]You got a rock candy.
[218:18.40]Lame.
[218:19.02]Alright, time for a new door.
[218:30.98]We might need that again.
[218:38.46]For every percentage that clicks on number five, one minute is deducted from the final amount of time I stream tonight.
[218:48.19]Just making sure you guys are aware of this.
[219:00.78]That also includes Mario as well.
[219:05.76]Here we go.
[219:15.35]At least 28 minutes.
[219:16.27]50, 60, 70... Okay, again, more than an hour is being removed from the stream.
[219:36.56]57 total minutes have been deleted from the end of the stream.
[219:39.90]So that means it's been about four hours.
[219:41.70]If I was gonna stream for like six, six and a half, I'm only streaming for fucking five.
[219:50.17]30 40 alright you okay there isn't alright for one time only so that was over 50 minutes that you guys just deleted for one time only if 100 of you click on Mario's nose I will I will negate what just happened it has to be 100
[220:35.10]some people just want to watch the world burn 10 10 that what a great experiment 10 of all people clicking I mean you that you're talking about 10 of people just like yeah chaos carnage
[221:13.30]Trolls.

[222:34.77]Once again, once again, once again.
[222:35.97]Do it again.
[222:48.96]Can we do a revote?
[222:49.84]I accidentally clicked on the follow button.
[222:53.07]Well, it's a good thing you accidentally clicked on the follow button, because that's how you were able to chat.
[222:57.51]So, um, it's good that you did that.

[223:34.90]It was going to be that.
[223:35.80]It was.
[223:36.22]It was just going to be that.
[223:40.38]Guys, that has happened 20 times in a row.
[223:47.18]Do you really think that this is going to be the one outlier where they don't... The 21st time.
[223:53.20]It's not going to be power.
[223:56.10]no way 26 nothing can't block that once again the screen's a little cut off I'll fix it in a second
[224:34.47]why I didn't want to resign I'm not I'm just gonna pick next door the next door is streamer's choice it's upside down mic muted oh I mean I definitely shouldn't scream into it then
[225:10.12]The Forkies are enraptured.
[225:30.03]The Forkies have come.
[225:31.49]To their senses.
[225:32.21]I gotta heal after this.
[225:38.77]Shall I just do it now?
[225:53.29]Peek mic, peek mic, peek mic.
[225:57.58]Okay, I'll peek the mic for your birthday.
[226:01.12]How's that, son?
[226:14.41]It is my birthday.
[226:16.17]Now, the person that said that, whenever their birthday is, and I already know that person's birthday.
[226:24.22]Because I remember their comment from July saying, it's my birthday, dude.
[226:31.90]And I was like, happy birthday.
[226:32.98]So now for next July.
[226:34.42]Gotta wait until July.
[226:52.10]Yeah, I don't want to peek my mic.
[226:53.08]I don't like peeking my mic.
[226:54.06]It hurts people's ears.
[227:01.53]Princess Peach has reached 19.
[227:03.59]Alright.
[227:08.18]Just getting it over with.
[227:20.13]So I got a question for you guys.
[227:21.33]So if I ever did a stream where I peaked the mic, like, and it was a full peak for like four seconds, and then I sampled that peak and made it four and a half hours long, how many viewers would that stream have?
[227:42.07]Would that stream have more or less than a thousand people there?
[227:58.42]Less than a thousand?
[228:01.20]I think that would be at... I don't think that would have more than 350 people there.
[228:20.81]Am I just sitting there listening to that?
[228:25.65]You can just mute.
[228:29.24]Yeah, you could.
[228:30.08]Never mind.
[228:33.26]You would come to that... You would open that stream and immediately hit the mute button.
[228:37.78]It'd be like... Oh, what's going... Hey, let me check out... Let me check out Jerma985's livestream.
[228:47.08]That sounds like a cool idea.
[228:48.20]I'm just opening the webpage right now.
[229:04.71]the fuck man that was fucking stupid that is how long it would take oh sorry hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on let's get this hold on
[229:38.96]Let's get a let's get a good representation of this Just give me something
[230:12.31]Alright, what?
[230:13.27]It's like Samsung phones, right?
[230:17.83]What's the current Samsung ad that plays on Twitch?
[230:35.26]Hold on.
[230:42.99]Everybody has ad block.
[230:44.83]You can't tell me what the current ad is.
[230:46.57]This will do.
[230:59.50]This will do.
[230:59.96]Who cares?
[231:00.30]Alright.
[231:04.02]Alright.
[231:05.94]Welcome.
[231:08.54]New viewer.
[232:14.89]Wait, you guys didn't get the joke there?
[232:16.95]All ads are broken.
[232:18.36]You can't close them.
[232:19.48]And half of them are fucking muted or way too loud.
[232:44.86]Okay, so you see... For some reason... No, no, no, I wanna do a super jump.
[233:00.14]What the fuck?
[233:15.08]Explain the joke, Peter.
[233:17.26]Alright, I'll give you a joke.
[233:19.60]Watch this.
[233:32.47]God damn it!
[233:33.57]I'm fucking so mad.
[234:03.88]Why are you doing this?
[234:05.58]Why is it so hard to do this?
[234:14.40]It's so fucking hard to do that.
[234:23.31]What, I get 37 one time?
[234:30.15]You super- that was super jump.
[234:34.07]That was- that wasn't super- I thought that was super jump.
[234:35.83]That wasn't super jump?
[234:40.32]That's super jump!
[234:55.93]Why?
[234:56.83]Why God?
[234:58.37]Tell me.
[235:00.17]I want an answer, God!
[235:22.35]God!
[235:22.79]I'm trying this one more time, and now I'm not.
[235:32.44]Never mind.
[235:39.27]What am I trying to do?
[235:39.97]Uh, I'm trying to jump with Super Jump a hundred times on somebody.
[235:49.47]The game changes the timings.
[235:53.33]based on how many times you've done it in a row so for instance if you know jump 1 through 10 is the same jump like 12 to 20 is different and then like jump like 18 or 20 to like 100 is one frame
[236:27.58]I don't fucking understand.
[236:39.09]Eleven is tricky.
[236:45.00]And the game is 60 FPS.
[236:47.00]Yeah, it is.
[236:55.35]Bye.
[237:19.95]Oh my god, why is it doing it now?
[237:22.29]How do I go from doing 37 of these to I can't even do more than 10 now?
[237:27.75]What?
[237:57.21]I'm gonna listen to a fuck tutorial.
[238:00.72]I need to do this.
[238:04.10]Why is the audio coming out of my dumb, stupid, shitty BenQ monitor?
[238:13.10]That's not fair.
[238:14.58]BenQ is like, there's actually... I like this monitor.
[238:22.57]I really like this monitor.
[238:28.30]Okay, hold on.
[238:29.42]Why?
[238:29.66]What happened to my sound effects?
[238:31.27]Why do I have no sound?
[238:32.39]I don't care.
[238:37.33]I'm not... No.
[238:37.85]That's gonna... That's gonna get... That's gonna... Look.
[238:40.17]Mario does power.
[238:43.09]Geno...
[239:14.38]What is it doing this for?
[239:16.82]I don't understand.
[239:19.20]I swear.
[240:17.12]I... don't understand what's changed.
[240:18.82]This is making me RAPIDLY angry, by the way.
[240:36.85]Did you just heal?
[241:15.80]I'm going to turn, I'm going to hit it as fast as I can.
[241:17.90]That's not going to help it.
[241:21.63]That's not going to help me.
[241:25.77]I guarantee it.
[241:28.61]It's not going to help me.
[241:34.01]Whatever.
[241:51.59]I do have the lazy shell, but it's cheating.
[241:54.79]I only cheat versus QX.
[241:56.01]Or, you know, whatever.
[242:00.41]Maybe I'll just put it on.
[242:04.66]I got a lot of health.
[242:28.67]Holy shit, I should have done Lucky.
[242:32.33]Alright, I'm going against it here.
[242:34.89]I'm doing Bowser HP.
[242:36.31]I'm sorry, it's my turn.
[242:41.68]Bingo, we got... Drill Claw!
[242:46.90]That is... Bowser's best weapon.
[242:54.99]Bowser can now come back into the party.
[242:58.85]Bowser has the lazy shell.
[243:02.67]We're also gonna give Bowser... Give Peach the shell.
[243:09.16]I want Bowser to have the most damage.
[243:11.36]Alright, this is okay.
[243:12.72]Alright.
[243:14.06]It's time.
[243:15.46]Alright, everybody relax.
[243:16.80]Settle down.
[243:17.30]It's time.
[243:22.81]Geno's gonna take a break.
[243:26.39]Bowser's back.
[243:28.91]Bowser has the drill claw.
[243:29.97]Bowser also is going to put on the work pants.
[243:35.15]And I want Bowser to do such an insane amount of damage.
[243:39.68]I want the attack scarf on Bowser.
[243:41.52]Oh, you can't wear it, Bowser.
[243:42.86]What?
[243:44.60]Really?
[243:44.84]Kind of ruins my whole plan.
[244:02.49]Let's give the XP booster to... Let's give it to Geno.
[244:04.79]Oh, Jinx Belt.
[244:05.37]There we go.
[244:05.73]Yeah.
[244:09.04]You can put on the XP booster, Geno.
[244:17.60]There we go.
[244:20.25]Bowser's now insane.
[244:27.81]Lazy Shell is not going on just yet.
[244:31.70]Give her the shell.
[244:32.47]Give her the shell.
[244:33.21]Give her the shell.
[244:33.97]Give her the shell.
[244:34.71]Give her the shell.
[244:35.47]Give her the shell.
[244:36.29]Give her the shell.
[244:37.67]No.
[244:38.79]No, I can't.
[244:43.02]Alright, can you guys click these from here?
[244:45.70]Let's find out.
[244:46.28]Hold on.
[245:01.14]Can you guys make it from here?
[245:03.74]Just try.
[245:04.82]Just try.
[245:10.56]Make it pinpoint.
[245:12.78]Be very accurate.
[245:23.86]Pretty good accuracy.
[245:29.22]17% on 6, but what is it on between 3 and 4?
[245:34.95]What is it?
[245:35.29]What is it?
[245:35.71]9% want me to leave.
[245:38.21]And it looks like that's a giant circle on 4.
[245:48.41]That's what I'm going to have to go with that one.
[245:52.35]That's a giant circle on 4.
[245:54.92]Thank you for voting.
[246:00.20]More combat.
[246:00.94]Alright, we got... Do I have any AoE?
[246:13.57]Peach has AoE, right?
[246:14.45]Yeah.
[246:19.26]That was terrible.
[246:29.89]350 damage.
[246:31.25]Oh yeah, Bowser is scaring the monsters.
[246:38.93]It's Bowser, run!
[246:53.21]Cowards.
[247:03.88]And Bowser, one hit kill.
[247:04.94]Let's see.
[247:08.32]Oh.
[247:10.07]Damn it.
[247:11.59]It's close.
[247:15.69]You have more than 500 HP.
[247:17.71]Do you?
[247:23.49]Now, Bowser's minions are not very loyal.
[247:24.92]Unfortunately.
[247:30.36]Unfortunately.
[248:13.31]How do you miss?
[248:28.32]How do you punch a ghost?
[248:29.96]You know what?
[248:30.66]You got me.
[248:32.70]You got me.
[248:33.49]It's true.
[248:41.30]What?
[248:42.18]Oh, it's the wrong one.
[248:43.98]Wrong one, Jerry.
[248:45.28]Wrong one.
[248:45.96]Let's see if I can get them all.
[249:17.72]100 coins?
[249:19.24]Whoa.
[249:28.86]Again, nooooooo.
[249:42.14]That was so bad, I can't even fucking believe it.
[249:47.39]Is the FPS, like, going up and down, like, crazy or something?
[250:09.88]Oh, that's an excuse?
[250:11.02]Oh, it absolutely is.
[250:15.54]I'm trying to make up excuses as to why I can't get that frame.
[250:23.91]Why did I get this game?
[250:24.65]Because this is one of the top five best games ever created.
[250:29.31]You know, changed my mind.
[250:31.67]Not gonna happen.
[250:49.97]What are the other four?
[250:52.60]Maybe I'll tell you one day.
[250:55.52]Diablo II.
[250:59.91]Mario RPG.
[251:02.03]Team Fortress 2.
[251:04.39]Chrono Trigger.
[251:08.07]And the Neverhood.
[251:23.23]And if you really want to, bump off the Neverhood and put in Bloodborne.
[251:28.87]It's probably more accurate at this stage.
[251:42.20]Bloodborne, yeah.
[251:43.76]I truly believe that Bloodborne is one of the best video games ever made.
[251:49.58]I truly believe that, I do.
[251:59.98]Now, if only they made it run at 60 FPS and put it everywhere else, then I think it would probably take that.
[252:22.43]I would even take a PS4 Pro patch.
[252:42.64]What about Super Frog?
[252:44.82]Well, Super Frog... No, I'm not going to go there.
[252:59.15]It's the best game that could come out of a cereal box.
[253:13.59]No, he's not voting anymore.
[253:14.81]No, we're past, we're beyond the voting stage.
[253:20.04]Yeah, I got them all.
[253:29.73]Boom.
[253:43.42]Star beep.
[253:47.30]Isn't that an emote?
[254:14.88]The final fight incoming.
[254:16.90]It's against... Nope.
[254:19.16]Is there another one of these?
[254:20.22]No, there isn't, right?
[254:23.07]I don't think there is.
[254:23.73]Are there three?
[254:32.07]Oh, that sucks.
[254:32.87]I hate that.
[254:33.37]Now I have to do it again.
[254:34.69]Ah, finally.
[254:48.40]Is there another door?
[254:50.64]No, it's not.
[254:52.32]Star gun!
[254:53.10]Hey!
[254:53.92]Look what I found.
[254:56.69]That is Geno's best weapon.
[255:02.81]The star gun.
[255:07.27]It goes... Exactly like that.
[255:13.53]Alright, there's only one more I have to do.
[255:14.73]You don't have very many choices.
[255:16.71]You have one, three, or six.
[255:20.72]You should be able to click these really fucking easily because they're so spread out.
[255:23.89]I don't want any excuses for this one.
[255:47.82]Looks like all the way at the end.
[255:49.12]32%.
[255:56.38]Okay.
[255:56.58]Number six.
[256:08.85]Got ten tries.
[256:12.99]Well, there goes one.
[256:24.65]Oh no, and I'm losing money for these too?
[256:27.41]Oh, the jump is so far.
[256:32.54]Oh no.
[256:46.74]Holy shit, man.
[256:51.31]The thing is, there's only one distance you can jump.
[256:53.93]Okay, I got plenty of coins.
[256:58.95]Five chances.
[256:59.67]It's all fucking reversed.
[257:13.40]Pick me up.
[257:14.46]Throw it away.
[257:14.90]Am I gonna get camped?
[257:32.11]Flower tab.
[257:32.63]Alright, I gotta bring these guys back here.
[257:45.67]Oh, you stupid idiot.
[257:47.07]Come on.
[257:47.87]What?
[257:48.13]Oh, that's bullshit.
[258:01.11]What's this?
[258:02.29]Max mushroom, get rid of a mid mushroom.
[258:08.25]Oh!
[258:08.31]What is that?
[258:12.22]Rock candy.
[258:13.56]Uh, get rid of a mid mushroom.
[258:20.46]I'm definitely at 99, 999, 99 coins, right?
[258:23.08]Yeah.
[258:23.83]Don't even pick, why would I pick up the coins?
[258:24.99]Well, it's the frog coin.
[258:28.41]Only frog coins.
[258:34.22]Five chances.
[258:38.68]Secret.
[258:41.12]Where?
[258:44.84]Where?
[258:51.29]Where?
[258:52.01]We missed a secret back in Ancestors.
[259:03.37]Nice.
[259:07.39]I gotta be a completionist.
[259:08.47]Okay, I got it.
[259:12.82]Alright, try not to mess this up.
[259:15.84]I have five attempts.
[259:21.20]Oh, I almost just missed it.
[259:22.59]Oh, okay.
[259:23.17]I gotta be careful because... God damn it!
[259:26.11]That's a... I knew that was gonna happen.
[259:46.05]Alright.
[259:51.84]Now the flower tab, good.
[259:58.92]Alright, this is gonna be tricky.
[260:03.16]What's this?
[260:04.00]Royal syrup?
[260:04.90]Just get rid of the maple syrup!
[260:06.76]No!
[260:07.60]Get rid of the mushroom.
[260:27.95]Oh fuck, I hit my head and I'm gonna fall all the way down It's okay I gotta get it.
[260:51.94]It could be something cool
[260:56.02]Oh my god, fuck you.
[260:58.30]Stupid platforming bullshit.
[261:04.03]Oh!
[261:04.59]Okay, what is this?
[261:33.88]Ooh, good.
[261:35.29]Get rid of pure water.
[261:36.19]These things are worthless.
[261:41.65]Sonic Symbol!
[261:43.57]That is Mallow's greatest weapon.
[261:48.90]Sticky Glove.
[261:49.84]Sonic Symbol.
[261:51.92]Nice.
[261:59.12]It's time.
[262:02.10]To go.
[262:03.34]Save point.
[262:05.26]Good.
[262:07.14]Nice.
[262:12.80]Mallow in.
[262:14.76]Alright.
[262:20.41]Mallow in.
[262:23.97]Mallow in.
[262:25.19]Geno in.
[262:26.47]Nope.
[262:34.90]His fire pants on.
[262:35.98]Give him the lazy shell.
[262:36.84]I'll give it a try.
[263:14.43]This is Smithy's castle.
[263:17.14]No trespassers allowed.
[263:51.21]That was so much damage.
[263:52.41]I wanna see if this does.
[263:54.49]I can jump more times with the star than I can with Mario.
[264:23.11]He's dead, stop.
[264:25.15]He's fighting.
[264:40.50]That's my child?
[264:45.48]My child?
[264:57.95]He brought a Jinx.
[264:59.95]Wait!
[265:01.53]Jinx is supposed to be on our team!
[265:12.22]That's okay, he's gone. 140.
[265:35.66]Boom, boom.
[265:36.64]One more hit, that should be it.
[265:44.96]Kamek raised Bowser.
[265:46.81]Hmm.
[265:58.60]That's... That's... Bajie Koopa!
[266:02.46]Huh?
[266:03.02]Where am I?
[266:04.84]Bowser?
[266:05.48]Hello.
[266:06.74]How have you been?
[266:07.38]I, uh, made it back here somehow.
[266:11.62]But it seems like I've been brainwashed or something.
[266:15.04]I can't seem to remember anything.
[266:17.36]Have I done something wrong?
[266:18.57]Uh... Don't worry about it.
[266:23.59]Let's just put it behind us.
[266:25.65]It's great running into loyal Koopa Troopa like you.
[266:29.76]Oh, I'm glad.
[266:31.34]Looks like you've got some tough new troopers now.
[266:35.55]But my magic can still help you.
[266:39.23]What's this?
[266:48.75]This magic treasure box will never run out of coins.
[266:52.49]Just keep on hitting it.
[266:54.93]I'll be here if you need me.
[266:56.99]Come by whenever you need to rejuvenate your HP and magic.
[267:02.14]What?
[267:05.94]Guys, you'll never know what I found.
[267:41.67]He's still hanging around?
[267:43.15]Oh, you want more items, huh?
[267:45.05]Since I'm in a good mood.
[267:47.09]Just remember, I can't always be coming to your rescue, you know.
[267:50.73]If there's anything more you need, best to buy it now.
[267:53.63]Well, you certainly have.
[267:58.24]Hero shirt, prince pants, star cape, heel shell, royal dress.
[268:02.24]Get it all.
[268:11.83]Hero shirt.
[268:13.21]Bang.
[268:15.43]Prince pants.
[268:17.15]Thank you.
[268:19.43]Heel shell.
[268:25.28]Yeah.
[268:28.62]Star cape.
[268:31.76]Royal dress.
[268:34.96]Lazy shell.
[268:36.81]Nope.
[268:38.81]It's time.
[268:43.26]Let's talk.
[269:20.12]You wanna see how crazy this thing is?
[269:21.52]Well, you'll see.
[269:24.11]We're gonna go with the original three.
[269:53.44]What do I got for items?
[269:56.66]Froggy drink.
[269:57.67]Royal syrup, royal syrup.
[269:58.83]Max mushroom, max, max, max.
[270:00.09]I need some more syrups.
[270:02.15]I'm getting rid of the bracers and the energizer.
[270:04.51]And, like, the pure water and all that crap. ...
[270:25.32]I'm gonna keep this.
[270:26.90]Use it on Culex.
[270:28.54]Alright.
[270:29.40]Let's get some more Royal Syrups.
[270:31.79]Or more Maple Syrups.
[270:34.21]That's good.
[270:37.43]In fact, I need... I'm probably... I need the Syrups more than I need... You gotta use Yoshi at some point, too.
[270:45.31]Mmm... Yeah.
[270:53.44]Yeah.
[270:57.41]FP is way more important to me.
[271:04.45]This is the part of the story where Krakow says, see ya.
[271:26.14]Fill me up.
[271:33.39]Wait, where's the save point?
[271:37.54]I can always... No, I got plenty of money.
[271:53.79]I don't need money for anything anymore.
[271:54.87]Oops.
[272:06.91]There's the lazy shell.
[272:10.58]It's just one of those big, chunky guys.
[272:32.98]Gino, level 20.
[272:37.68]I'm gonna go... Power.
[272:42.23]That's right.
[272:43.23]I've selected.
[272:49.45]Thank you.
[273:07.11]Here we go.
[273:09.03]It's time.
[273:10.13]We're in Bowser's castle in the throne room.
[273:21.80]Ah, so you are the notorious Mario.
[273:25.69]I am impressed you made it this far.
[273:27.99]I didn't think you could.
[273:31.99]Oh, feisty little fellow.
[273:34.49]Untie me.
[273:35.93]But this is the end of the line.
[273:38.43]Now you've got to deal with me and God.
[273:49.72]This lazy shell, this motherfucker.
[274:02.15]The boomer.
[274:04.90]Oh, what's that?
[274:05.58]You can't even hurt me!
[274:08.56]I am unstoppable!
[274:10.28]Although, I can't hurt you either.
[274:19.22]Is this the final boss?
[274:20.98]You guessed it.
[274:21.98]This is the final encounter of the game.
[274:29.22]This is the dastardly villain known as Smithy.
[274:44.42]No!
[274:45.00]The one person... Okay, good.
[274:46.04]That's fine.
[274:50.23]Just do the Groove Heel.
[274:55.39]Oh, shit.
[274:55.83]That's right.
[274:56.21]Her magic is terrible now.
[274:57.78]Because I put the Lazy Shell on her.
[275:01.98]Forgot about that.
[275:20.00]Let's do an Ultra Flame.
[275:21.52]Now that you're blue, might as well.
[275:39.82]You're blue now.
[275:42.60]Another group hug. 69.
[275:51.35]That's so much damage.
[275:54.57]Nice miss.
[276:05.59]This is absurd.
[276:08.05]I can't be defeated by them.
[276:11.04]I won't let this happen.
[276:13.64]I will not fall in battle.
[276:19.06]Having an attack.
[276:25.53]I don't need your sympathy.
[276:27.93]I am a soldier.
[276:29.75]I am prepared to go.
[276:33.43]Take a dive, Chandelier.
[276:39.90]See you later, kids.
[276:46.79]Boomer!
[276:49.34]Oh, poor mother.
[276:52.02]But not to worry.
[276:52.98]A little fall isn't gonna hurt you.
[277:01.92]Alright, Mario.
[277:03.69]I'll lead you to the top.
[277:05.81]We must hurry to the appointed place.
[277:09.85]Hang on tight.
[277:11.07]And away we go!
[277:29.14]Increasing speed!
[277:43.88]Next up, the top floor!
[277:47.22]Please fasten your seatbelts and... Wait a second.
[277:51.18]There are no seatbelts!
[277:52.58]I killed them!
[277:54.84]I killed all three of them!
[277:57.68]Why didn't they trust me?
[277:58.46]I'm a bad guy!
[277:59.12]I've been in the castle for fucking the last six months as a bad person!
[278:09.25]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
[278:17.81]The Eye is protecting Exor.
[278:40.03]One.
[278:40.19]They're all so overpowered right now.
[278:44.20]I have all the best items in the game.
[278:49.58]Except for that.
[278:50.16]That was painful.
[278:50.88]That was very painful.
[279:04.51]Uh, yes.
[279:05.75]This is... This is the meme boss, and by meme boss I mean... This is the boss that you can kill in less than five seconds.
[279:15.66]Uh, Geno can kill this boss in less than a second.
[279:20.45]I just figured we would... I don't... You want to see how... I want to play it this way.
[279:29.45]X-Horse protection is gone.
[279:36.38]Yes, you can do 9,999 damage to this boss with Jim.
[279:39.82]And everybody knows that.
[279:42.17]So, I mean, that's like a thing... That's like in every top 10 did-you-know-gaming lists.
[279:49.45]It's like number 6 on every single one of them.
[279:53.74]So, I mean, are you really that shocked?
[279:55.10]Do you need to see it?
[280:09.17]Bam.
[280:09.37]That slow down.
[280:10.17]I gotta give her the mouth.
[280:31.08]Alright, that's bad.
[280:32.90]First bad thing that happened.
[280:36.38]I mean, you're gonna come back with like 20 health.
[280:38.00]95, that's fine.
[280:56.44]Let's do one of Bowser's fun moves.
[281:05.03]The Crusher.
[281:05.74]Uh-oh, that hurts.
[281:08.52]Let's do a group hug.
[281:16.20]Knock out the... Don't... Knock the mouth out.
[281:18.02]The mouth is annoying.
[281:19.71]It does too many moves.
[281:20.59]There we go.
[281:22.39]Take out the other eye, too.
[281:35.07]Alright, other eye.
[281:43.86]Come on.
[281:44.20]I want the whole thing down.
[281:46.03]I want to shut down his whole computer.
[282:02.79]Come on, shut off his whole computer!
[282:06.38]Done.
[282:12.82]He doesn't stand a chance to me with my best items in the game.
[282:17.14]Oh no.
[282:19.62]Uh.
[282:33.30]Everyone's fine.
[282:33.84]Go for the guy.
[282:35.32]Go for the XO.
[282:38.66]Use Yoshi?
[282:39.52]Alright.
[282:40.42]No.
[282:41.14]Let's use Yoshi for the real fight.
[282:42.82]You know what I mean?
[282:44.80]I'm going to use Yoshi.
[282:45.37]We're going to use everything on Kill Exit.
[282:46.97]You want to use Yoshi now?
[282:54.39]Oh shit.
[282:55.15]I forgot.
[282:55.73]You guys don't know.
[282:56.37]You haven't played this game.
[283:00.19]I'm sorry, I just... shit.
[283:03.41]Oh shit!
[283:04.51]Oh no!
[283:05.15]Guys, there's like two more hours in this game.
[283:10.84]Uh oh, gunk ball.
[283:32.29]Oh, is everybody alive?
[283:36.38]Everybody's fine.
[283:38.40]Alright, do you want me to reload the save and kill this boss in one hit?
[283:58.10]Sure, why not?
[283:58.76]Yeah, that'd be cool.
[284:11.02]So, the Geno World timing is, like, I think right when it comes out of his hand, right?
[284:14.44]It's, like, right when it just comes out of your fingers.
[284:17.86]You have to go through Boomer and cutscenes again?
[284:19.56]Yeah, that's true.
[284:22.09]There's a weird timing on it.
[284:27.07]as it leaves the screen so it's right when it goes right when it leaves
[284:57.08]Don't reset?
[284:57.90]I won't.
[285:01.44]Once I finish everything I want to do... Maybe I'll... Next save that I do is going to be a different slot.
[285:06.97]And maybe before I end the stream, we'll just go try and do it.
[285:10.83]It'll be one of those after things that we do.
[285:16.59]There we go.
[285:19.39]Alright.
[285:21.52]I think we're getting to the end of this boss...
[285:29.10]Yep Sucked up Peach, level 20 Shlop
[286:04.43]Do you know where this leads to?
[286:07.78]It looks like Exor is the contact between the two worlds.
[286:11.72]In other words, if we follow this road, we'll find Smithy.
[286:17.81]So what's keeping us?
[286:19.85]Hang on.
[286:21.75]Hey, I only joined so that I could get my castle back.
[286:25.13]I'm not going to be dragged along in this stupid hunt.
[286:28.53]This is as far as I go.
[286:31.02]I'm going to gather my troops and rebuild my castle.
[286:34.57]And you, Mario, you're an official member of the Koopa Troop.
[286:38.84]It's your duty to help with the repairs.
[286:42.56]Bowser, you're completely missing the point.
[286:47.52]I ought to rip your stuffing out.
[286:50.58]No, think about it, Bowser.
[286:52.46]This sword connects the two worlds, right?
[286:55.64]Yeah, so?
[286:57.66]Even if we defeat Exor, there will be other weapon beasts to follow him.
[287:03.89]Your castle is at your entrance point to your world.
[287:07.41]In short, they'll be back.
[287:10.77]Is that what you want?
[287:13.41]Ah.
[287:14.75]Well.
[287:17.21]Eh.
[287:19.07]More weapon things coming to take over my castle?
[287:21.95]What about my privacy?
[287:24.97]Yikes.
[287:26.37]This isn't good at all.
[287:27.33]In fact, this stinks.
[287:29.95]But I can't just be pals with these cretins.
[287:32.85]I've got an image to keep up.
[287:37.49]I got it.
[287:39.47]No one insults the Koopa Troopa and gets away with it.
[287:42.25]I've got a bone to pick with this Smitty guy.
[287:45.55]Come on, Mario.
[287:46.49]We'll teach you a lesson.
[287:49.16]Bowser needs Nord?
[287:52.20]I'm so sly.
[287:55.00]It looks like we're together on this one.
[287:58.38]Let's-a go.
[288:26.37]VPN.
[288:31.88]No!
[288:39.91]We can't see that.
[288:48.65]Good thing I have this safe so we can go from here all the way back to where we were.
[289:03.52]Z-L-Z-R?
[289:04.87]What do you mean Z-L-Z-R?
[289:07.87]Z-L-Z-R?
[289:13.83]Rewind.
[289:14.51]You're on the classic.
[289:15.15]What do you mean rewind?
[289:16.39]I can't rewind.
[289:17.15]I mean rewind on the classic.
[289:18.44]How do I do that?
[289:21.92]Can I rewind on the classic?
[289:25.28]Hold Z... I don't have Z-L-Z-R.
[289:30.24]Hit reset.
[289:39.03]What's that?
[289:46.47]Save?
[289:49.01]Stop, stop, stop.
[289:49.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[289:56.30]Hit X. Rewind?
[289:59.20]How far?
[289:59.66]Wait, is this for real?
[290:01.92]I'm scared.
[290:02.40]What does that mean?
[290:12.51]Don't listen to one fuck- what if I hit X, what happens?
[290:19.05]Don't.
[290:21.06]Hit Y, make a save state just in case.
[290:23.50]Okay.
[290:24.98]Now let's rewind.
[290:27.60]Is this gonna be fucking bad?
[290:33.33]What the hell is happening?
[290:36.33]What is going on?
[290:38.45]What?
[290:52.88]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[290:53.48]Okay, I'm gonna come in.
[290:56.63]I'm gonna come in right here.
[290:58.65]Right... You can actually time travel in it.
[291:02.87]It records the whole thing?
[291:06.51]I didn't know you could do this.
[291:09.15]Alright, so come in right... now.
[291:14.09]Wow.
[291:20.41]What?
[291:20.67]What?
[291:23.34]That's insane!
[291:28.08]I didn't know you could do that.
[291:34.56]That's so cool.
[291:39.05]Alright.
[291:40.93]Here we are.
[291:41.77]I'm good.
[291:54.32]You created a time paradox.
[291:55.48]No, I didn't.
[291:58.16]I came back in the second I was about to create a save, which therefore would have created a new timeline.
[292:06.12]So I came in on the current timeline and stopped right before a new timeline was created.
[292:11.22]Therefore, I'm playing in that last timeline.
[292:15.34]I made sure that I did that correctly.
[292:21.28]The other timeline is doomed.
[292:23.26]We don't care about that one.
[292:26.08]We're not in that one.
[292:42.09]The other... You killed the other timeline.
[292:44.84]No, that time... That's scary.
[292:47.78]I don't like that.
[292:51.02]Um...
[292:53.21]No, that timeline... Alright, so let me think about this for a second.
[292:57.06]So we were walking, we were playing.
[293:01.32]And then I needed to go back in time, so... I went back... So the Mario that was walking forward... I'm not gonna... I don't have a PhD, I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[293:14.19]I don't care.
[293:20.34]Oh, for those of you that are curious, these little guys here give the most experience in the whole game.
[293:23.86]And there's a place where you can farm them to get to like 300 million levels.
[293:26.32]Oh my god.
[293:50.60]Rewind every time you miss a jump out of a hundred.
[293:57.79]You can't make me do that.
[294:00.08]Oh my god.
[294:39.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[294:49.49]Fuck!
[294:50.81]That's too hard to do that.
[295:05.62]That's impossible to do that.
[295:07.10]No way.
[295:10.14]You're creating a whole bunch of doomed timelines?
[295:11.80]Who gives a shit?
[295:12.48]1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... It's... No, no, no!
[295:24.12]You fucking idiot!
[295:26.96]I'm trying... Who cares about all these other people?
[295:35.51]Can I speed it up?
[295:40.17]It's 12, so on 11 I have to come back.
[295:42.09]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[296:14.29]This is a lot!
[296:15.85]Oh, hold on!
[296:26.64]What?
[296:28.56]Okay, here we go.
[296:36.83]I'm just- I'm connecting timelines.
[296:42.63]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.
[296:46.57]I'm coming in.
[297:18.77]Was that 40?
[297:19.43]40.
[297:19.45]43 jumps.
[297:21.85]Alright, let's- I gotta come.
[298:08.50]For 940, I'm coming in.
[298:11.24]Shit, I lost, I lost jumps.
[298:30.73]Timer in the top right?
[298:31.79]I, yeah, but I did sit here for a second.
[298:46.76]Just coming at five seconds.
[298:49.94]Okay.
[298:55.38]Okay.
[298:57.24]Okay, I don't know how many that was.
[299:05.38]I don't know, we have to count, right?
[299:20.73]What am I doing?
[299:22.08]I have to do this.
[299:23.92]I am this far into this.
[299:26.25]It's the only way.
[300:04.32]Me!
[300:12.13]Why can't I just have... Why do I have to... That was 46?
[300:19.09]Oh my god.
[300:26.34]Just, like, go make a hamburger or something.
[300:28.08]Like, just come back in five minutes.
[300:44.18]Those of you that don't know what's going on, if you do a hundred of these in a row, you get the best armor in the whole game.
[300:50.12]It's like a secret.
[300:56.65]Okay, I'm done.
[300:57.79]I'm done.
[300:58.47]I can't.
[300:58.85]It's impossible.
[301:10.13]You gotta do this shit 100 times in a row.
[301:14.33]Create a save state every jump.
[301:16.97]Every time I... Okay, wait, that's a good idea.
[301:18.42]Alright.
[301:22.98]How do I... I have to come in and then do what?
[301:26.34]Come in and then hit... Save state the battle part.
[301:31.10]Wait, okay, what if I save state right here?
[301:35.99]Like, I'm gonna hit start, save state.
[301:42.83]Oh my god, oh my god!
[301:45.29]I'm about to fucking rip the controller out of my hands.
[301:49.07]I couldn't do it fast enough.
[301:53.20]Save state the battle?
[301:54.70]No, I can't do that.
[301:55.56]Because that loses all 46 of these jumps.
[302:16.66]Just hold on.
[302:17.65]I'm gonna try this.
[302:49.54]Press and hold.
[302:53.22]What happened?
[302:54.18]What did I just do?
[302:59.33]What just happened?
[303:00.59]How do I unlock this?
[303:04.93]What?
[303:10.17]What the fuck is going on?
[303:33.86]I lost 20 jumps.
[303:35.52]No, I didn't.
[303:47.64]I'm done.
[303:53.45]I'm done.
[303:54.39]I save-stated it right here and I fucking fell off the motherfucker.
[303:58.73]No, man.
[303:59.57]No.
[304:00.15]Nope.
[304:01.31]Nope.
[304:02.19]No.
[304:03.07]That's it.
[304:08.63]I'm not doing that.
[304:11.70]I don't care if I never see 100 jumps.
[304:13.48]That shit's fucking impossible.
[304:19.77]100 frame perfect jumps.
[304:21.59]No.
[304:23.47]I ain't doing it.
[304:23.91]I've never done it.
[304:24.51]I've never done it once in 15 years.
[304:25.73]I ain't gonna do it.
[304:41.90]Ah, here's the room, by the way.
[304:46.38]No, I can't.
[304:47.32]It's too... That's too fucking hard to do that.
[304:56.60]That's what you said about the five... Yeah, but the 5,000 points in the Game Boy game wasn't... Coming down from the air, loading into a save state.
[305:30.76]Ah, there's Mario's best weapon.
[305:36.93]Although, I do have the Lazy Shell, so I don't think it's gonna be... I don't think it's gonna matter.
[305:42.33]No.
[305:43.39]The Ultra Hammer.
[305:45.77]The Lazy Shell is better.
[305:52.58]That's how everybody does that.
[305:55.22]They open up their emulator and they slow time down to like a tenth of 60 seconds.
[306:01.84]And it's just... It's right when Mario's shoe touches the enemy.
[306:26.44]It's Mario.
[306:27.90]It's Mario.
[306:29.28]How did he get in here?
[306:31.28]We better do something!
[306:46.14]Time is marching on.
[306:47.58]Doom.
[306:48.58]Rebirth.
[306:55.20]It's three o'clock, time to recover.
[307:06.34]Gotta take out the heads first.
[307:11.59]Uh, everyone's good.
[307:29.07]Oh no, he's destroying every timeline.
[307:38.04]He's even destroying the clock that controls the time.
[307:42.32]I know.
[307:43.36]I'm a sick fuck, aren't I?
[307:57.46]Oh, does Bowser have any other moves?
[308:05.01]Fear roulette.
[308:07.11]Oh, it's dinner time.
[308:13.41]Don't forget the math puzzles.
[308:14.87]What do you mean, math puzzles?
[308:23.12]Math puzzles?
[308:32.46]Time to break.
[308:32.96]Alright, let's, uh, let's get Peach back.
[308:37.18]Doesn't she have the lazy shell?
[308:45.05]Yeah.
[308:46.29]But... Uh, the lazy shell cannot protect from instant death.
[308:53.25]Unfortunately.
[308:59.68]Come back Bowser, please!
[309:19.15]I can't believe Bowser's fucking dead.
[309:30.99]He's dead again.
[309:48.56]Oh, by the way, anybody that, like, comes back and says, oh, did he do the 100 jumps?
[309:51.87]Just say yes.
[309:52.57]That was gonna take, like, 34 minutes.
[309:59.37]That shit was gonna take the rest of the night to do that.
[310:06.69]I had to pull the plug.
[310:07.97]I had to.
[310:27.38]You played the Beatle game for an hour?
[310:29.48]Yeah, but the Beatle game, that was like mind-destroying.
[310:34.66]Trying to do that hundred jumps thing in the middle of a jump, going to different timelines.
[310:47.30]Jeremy's a fucking quitter.
[310:52.56]It was the same thing.
[310:53.66]No, I can't just, I can't.
[311:00.05]Level 20 finally, good Oh no Look at all these crafted characters
[311:42.17]Maybe at the very end of the stream, I will lose my fucking mind and try to get it done.
[311:49.59]But not right now.
[311:50.85]I want to get through the rest of the game first.
[312:15.60]21.
[312:15.64]What am I gonna do?
[312:16.20]Koolex!
[312:18.26]Very soon, actually.
[312:20.14]Very soon.
[312:25.70]I want that item.
[312:38.97]Nooo!
[312:43.29]Good avoiding.
[312:44.05]Good dodging.
[312:46.12]Aaaaah!
[312:47.52]Hey!
[312:50.88]Stop!
[312:51.34]I'm trying to move.
[312:52.51]Stop!
[313:00.73]Annoying.
[313:36.02]Time to fight all the bosses again.
[313:38.48]Remember these guys?
[313:39.50]Remember this guy?
[313:53.74]Wait, we got to 100?
[313:54.60]I was tabbed out.
[313:55.30]Yeah.
[314:00.78]How was your burger?
[314:12.99]I wanted to get to 200.
[314:13.47]Aww.
[314:13.65]No, I thought I could get the peach to go.
[314:35.85]Speaking of burgers, you know what I had recently that I actually thought was pretty good?
[314:47.27]Alright, you ready?
[314:50.57]You know what I ate that I thought was actually pretty damn good?
[314:57.67]Hopefully nobody laughs at me for this.
[314:59.59]The Beyond Burger.
[315:03.85]It was pretty good.
[315:09.30]Subway?
[315:10.52]No.
[315:15.02]It's actually really damn good.
[315:18.18]I went in like a total dick.
[315:24.66]I didn't believe at all.
[315:26.76]I was one of those people like, okay, because I'm serious.
[315:29.75]Every fake meat I've ever had sucked.
[315:34.07]It was fucking terrible.
[315:36.66]I don't know what they do to the beyond meat, the beyond like fake meat, but it is the closest thing I've ever had.
[315:49.74]How am I missing so many?
[315:51.14]And then the ghosts, right?
[315:56.04]I'm gonna leave.
[315:56.62]There's too many sponsorships and you didn't jump a hundred times.
[316:08.80]Why can't we please just kill these things?
[316:11.87]Die!
[316:13.83]Ah!
[316:14.15]Royal syrup.
[316:14.75]Maple syrup.
[316:39.42]The Beyond Burger.
[316:44.60]Where is this trying to go?
[316:48.55]Oh, wow.
[316:49.29]That just was bad.
[316:50.05]What the fuck?
[316:51.19]I panicked because I didn't know what was going on here.
[317:01.54]What's going on here?
[317:08.30]Max mushroom.
[317:09.20]Um... What am I gonna do?
[317:30.77]Second boss.
[317:36.60]Out of... I was going to say money.
[317:39.98]Auto is extra savory.
[317:42.28]Good, just keep hitting them.
[318:15.27]How long until the game ends?
[318:17.13]Well, the game... The game ends very shortly.
[318:22.47]But... There's a very specific thing that I'm going to do.
[318:26.09]I'm going to try to beat the... The Impossible Burger Boss.
[318:35.52]And then I'm going to... No, I'm not.
[318:36.96]I'm not going to try to jump 100 times.
[318:41.63]That's like 600 people left during that.
[318:45.12]You want me to do that again?
[318:59.03]You told them to.
[319:00.67]No, I didn't tell them to leave.
[319:01.75]I told them to make some food and come back.
[319:04.45]I said come back in five minutes and it'll be done.
[319:06.77]It's been 20 minutes and nobody came back.
[319:09.78]They found something better to do.
[319:21.70]Told him to leave.
[319:23.26]No, I didn't I said go like if you don't just go make a hamburger and come back How long does it take to make a hamburger?
[319:33.50]Actually depends It takes a fucking hour to make
[319:49.73]That's so funny You gotta defrost it
[320:20.95]What do you mean, defrost it?
[320:24.39]Alright, now this is the time of the stream where I go get Kill-Lex!
[320:33.75]Because we're getting to end game here.
[320:48.28]Is there a way out of here?
[320:51.81]I forget if there's a way out of here or not.
[320:59.38]I think I actually have to go back.
[321:02.89]It's alright.
[321:22.70]Yeah, you just lost the ground beef.
[321:23.86]You don't get those shitty Costco patties, do you?
[321:28.44]No, I just get, like, grocery store hamburgers.
[321:47.28]You store it at room temperature?
[321:48.32]No, I... I eat it.
[321:51.34]Within, like, a few days, I get it.
[321:55.45]Behold, they've taken the bait!
[321:59.81]I guess I can spare a few minutes.
[322:02.03]Maybe they'd like to play.
[322:12.78]End of bubble.
[322:30.42]They throw a bunch of bosses at you here at the very end.
[322:34.28]This was a RPG trope back in the day.
[322:43.05]You kind of had to go through a bunch of shit before you got to the end.
[322:56.00]God, I love it.
[322:58.02]I love this game.
[323:02.51]fun game just to play.
[323:20.84]I think there is a way for me to get out still.
[323:29.23]Phew, what weaklings.
[323:31.31]How shameful if they were to defeat me.
[323:33.33]Oh yeah, I forgot about this.
[323:45.18]It's clobberin' time!
[324:00.52]Oh, fuck.
[324:05.32]Sued.
[324:08.77]Mr. Alfredson?
[324:11.15]You're going to jail.
[324:17.77]There it is, I did it.
[324:18.43]It's right before it goes in.
[324:24.52]That's much better.
[324:25.16]Alright, uh, the Mad Adder or Domino?
[324:29.14]Let's go for Domino.
[324:32.14]Since he's the one controlling the device, why not get him to shut it off?
[324:36.21]Right?
[324:48.36]Everyone's taking a lot of damage.
[324:52.36]If you do 100 jumps, I'll give you $100.
[324:54.31]I can't do it.
[324:56.43]I mean, I will painfully attempt to do it a few times at the very end of the stream.
[325:01.50]But not right now.
[325:14.16]Don't kill Mario, please.
[325:22.54]Dooboo Puck.
[325:30.76]I have to do it on my first try?
[325:33.96]Well, I can guarantee you that's not gonna happen.
[325:51.15]The highest I got legit was 37.
[325:53.64]Or like 39 or something, right?
[326:09.43]Inflating the number?
[326:10.23]No, it was 37.
[326:17.36]It wasn't... it was fine.
[326:19.08]Ooh, that was big.
[326:24.36]That's 436 damage.
[326:25.20]Bingo.
[326:29.76]Yeah, the clock, these two guys, all the random physics experience.
[326:33.98]Alright, let's see if I can do this on my own.
[326:39.81]What's going on?
[326:40.27]I don't find that to be very fair, but that's okay.
[326:45.99]Peach 21.
[326:46.39]I want to do regular defense with Peach, I think.
[326:50.95]No.
[326:51.81]Magic.
[326:57.67]So we are now at this stage where I believe I can... Alright, yeah.
[327:02.17]This... I'm at the... This is the end of the game.
[327:04.87]So... Let's go.
[327:07.28]It's time...
[327:10.27]I'm gonna save it here.
[327:11.21]I'm gonna go back.
[327:20.40]See if I can make it back quickly.
[327:22.34]Oh my god.
[327:23.82]We're gonna try to kill, uh, get rid of, we're gonna try to fight Kulitz.
[327:29.50]It's not time for 100 jumps.
[327:32.80]That's after the game is finished and the credits roll.
[327:35.86]And I'm, I'm, you know what?
[327:38.69]That's not gonna happen.
[327:41.61]That's gonna be a waste of time.
[327:50.15]Do it on Culex.
[327:52.23]Is it Culex or Culex?
[327:54.48]Or Culex?
[327:55.58]What's the name of this song?
[328:06.18]It's called the March of the Dachshunds.
[328:11.18]At least that's what my mother used to call it.
[328:18.30]It's like the doggy, like, march song.
[328:20.90]Please run away.
[328:24.28]Alright, we did it.
[328:39.55]My neck just ripped up to the ceiling because I got caught by this.
[328:51.05]I made that noise up into the sky.
[328:53.29]First try, good.
[328:59.06]Come on, fall.
[329:00.76]Do it.
[329:05.84]What the fuck?
[329:06.54]I didn't do anything.
[329:14.42]I gotta do this quick.
[329:15.48]Let's go.
[329:16.87]Oh my god.
[329:19.25]I've lost step.
[329:20.03]Which is certain at this point.
[329:32.50]I wonder what the percentage is to do that.
[329:34.80]What's the actual percentage to run away in games like this?
[329:37.56]Especially this one.
[329:38.18]I don't think I've ever known.
[329:59.26]Alright, almost done.
[330:01.18]Just gotta get past this part.
[330:05.28]Good.
[330:11.14]Actually, that's better, I think.
[330:12.82]Because now I can... Oh, shit.
[330:15.48]What the fuck is in here?
[330:17.27]Alright.
[330:19.93]I didn't know that was in here.
[330:30.39]Alright, we're so close to being able to attempt Culex.
[330:33.77]Where's this... where's this going?
[330:51.11]Oh.
[331:01.48]I might be asking, why am I making another one?
[331:04.16]Well... Because Koolex... I'm gonna have two timelines.
[331:12.67]We're gonna have a beat the game timeline.
[331:15.01]To see the credits.
[331:15.67]And then we're gonna have a Koolex timeline.
[331:18.69]I think.
[331:19.81]That's not what I wanted to do.
[331:28.58]No more timelines.
[331:40.53]Am I gonna get turned?
[331:59.86]Alright.
[332:01.62]I said, alright, like five times.
[332:04.06]Okay.
[332:04.42]Alright.
[332:05.26]Alright.
[332:07.48]Alright.
[332:09.98]Here we go.
[332:12.92]The gate.
[332:14.42]Let's go back and fight Mr. Coolix.
[332:23.26]I think we're equipped.
[332:24.26]We're leveled up.
[332:30.54]Let's just take a look at what we got.
[332:32.38]Bowser, Mario, and Toadstool.
[332:36.95]Lazy shell.
[332:39.09]Lazy shell.
[332:40.83]Ghost medal, jinx medal, tax scarf.
[332:42.65]I think we can just give it a go.
[332:44.99]I'm going to save it over here.
[332:49.79]Let's see if I can beat him.
[333:11.56]Greetings.
[333:13.33]I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.
[333:17.89]I have crossed into this dimension to fight for the Dark Mage.
[333:21.59]But this world is uninhabitable for me of my kind.
[333:25.05]I must return to my old world.
[333:28.37]Before I go, though, I would like to challenge your strongest knight.
[333:34.49]Will you accept my challenge?
[333:37.99]Will you enter combat against me?
[333:43.82]Engage.
[333:48.14]I am matter.
[333:49.54]I am antimatter.
[333:51.13]I can see your past.
[333:52.99]I can see your future.
[333:55.07]I consume time.
[333:56.77]And I will consume you.
[333:58.17]So we've got Kill-Lex, Wind Crystal, Earth, Water, and Fire.
[334:08.55]We're gonna go with Water.
[334:09.81]One of these takes a lot of damage.
[334:11.17]We're gonna go with Water Crystal first.
[334:24.87]Alright, we got that's not bad they all of them do like two or three moves each This is me from the other timelines I didn't even get a chance Didn't even get a chance.
[334:45.60]That's why we've got come back and I got the timing down.
[334:48.48]Correct.
[334:50.04]It's right There
[335:04.18]Come on.
[335:04.72]We gotta get rid of that water crystal first.
[335:07.48]I can't even hurt Peach.
[335:17.15]I'm sorry.
[335:18.77]You know what?
[335:19.43]What the fuck does this do?
[335:25.03]I don't know.
[335:27.49]Defense up.
[335:36.42]Don't do it, Amario.
[335:37.84]Peach.
[335:40.14]Not good.
[335:43.39]Amario's going to die here.
[335:46.51]Oh, thank God.
[335:47.99]Would you look at that?
[335:48.65]Alright.
[335:49.43]Let's do group hug.
[335:50.37]No.
[335:51.77]Hmm.
[335:52.83]Yeah.
[335:56.53]Damn it.
[335:56.89]I missed it.
[336:05.31]Pop it.
[336:05.61]Come on.
[336:11.27]Uh-oh.
[336:11.51]I can throw up the candies, the fire bombs, rock candies and stuff.
[336:26.10]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[336:27.10]I'll do that.
[336:34.64]Time for Yoshi?
[336:36.18]Well, maybe in a minute.
[336:40.35]No, I gotta bring back Mario.
[336:41.51]Oh, fuck.
[336:49.85]What happened?
[336:52.39]Auto-peed.
[336:53.47]Don't even do this.
[336:54.48]Don't start this bullshit again.
[336:55.96]60 damage with the lazy shell.
[336:58.08]That's fucking insane.
[337:01.52]The last time people said, like, auto-peed at the house, and I, like, ran downstairs and, like, nothing happened.
[337:20.58]Kulex is a genus of mosquitoes.
[337:22.72]Alright, that's good.
[337:27.50]We just need to get rid of the crystals, because they cause all the damage.
[337:34.00]Mario, okay, there we go.
[337:36.36]Peach is seriously just here to bring people back and to heal.
[337:41.28]And to stay alive, I mean, obviously I have to be careful.
[337:49.46]That was weird.
[337:49.86]That took a long time.
[337:51.54]Oh, come on.
[337:52.18]I didn't even know I got attacked.
[338:04.45]Pop it.
[338:12.17]Bro luck just gave a hundred bucks.
[338:17.12]I'm fighting bits.
[338:18.82]Yes, I am.
[338:19.36]I got some bad news.
[338:23.37]I don't know if I will complete the challenge, but thank you.
[338:26.25]Thank you on the congratulations.
[338:28.03]And thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[338:45.01]Now you have to do it.
[338:46.49]I will give it a real attempt.
[338:48.49]I promise.
[338:55.32]God, it's still there.
[338:56.42]I almost want psychopaths if I know how much health they have.
[339:03.06]He paid you a hundred fucking dollars for that.
[339:04.91]You have to.
[339:06.51]I'm gonna try.
[339:15.17]Damn, that hurt.
[339:24.69]How much health does Peach have?
[339:25.69]101.
[339:25.71]Just get rid of the blue crystal.
[339:28.81]No!
[339:45.73]he does it a hundred times oh you're pathetic turbo I can do it got it one down yeah I can do it oops uh sorry hold let me rewind let me read my time for a minute
[340:17.86]This is actually much harder than it looks.
[340:20.66]Sorry for making fun of you earlier.
[340:29.11]How do you do this without the lazy shell?
[340:30.55]You don't.
[340:34.19]Which one of them takes damage?
[340:38.16]This one does.
[340:38.74]One of them takes... I think they all do.
[340:51.91]You have to get him a bunch of rock candies.
[340:54.79]Yeah.
[340:57.33]You just get like 15 rock candies and just use them all in a row and heal the fuck out of everybody and hope you win.
[341:17.53]Speaking of those... Ah, rock candy!
[341:20.69]Let's go ahead and use it.
[341:26.61]200.
[341:26.69]I'm gonna do it again.
[341:37.43]You know what?
[341:37.85]Let's get Yoshi out here, too.
[341:39.45]Come on out, Yoshi.
[341:41.57]What do you think?
[341:44.27]For the first time, let's see what Yoshi... Let's see what Yoshi does.
[341:48.10]Come on out, boy!
[341:51.66]Let's do it to... Right to Coolix!
[341:53.67]Let's go!
[342:06.60]He did it!
[342:07.52]He did it!
[342:08.18]He wins!
[342:18.44]Yeah, I think he took a candy or something.
[342:26.99]He stole something from Kulix.
[342:30.29]Damn, that fucking hurts.
[342:32.19]Uh, he stole... What did he take?
[342:37.89]Yoshi candy.
[342:40.95]Yoshi candy?
[342:41.67]Are we just gonna go for it?
[342:47.45]Wait, where's my rock candy?
[342:57.77]Got a freebie!
[342:58.30]I can do it again!
[342:58.78]I was going to say, this is how you lose the game.
[343:06.98]Even with Lazy Shell, if Peach gets transformed, and then she gets melee'd twice, it's over.
[343:14.47]That can't happen.
[343:21.53]Uh, does Group... How do I... Can I... Does Groupon get rid of, um, status effects?
[343:28.21]Yes, it does.
[343:28.63]Jesus.
[343:28.75]78?
[343:28.79]What is this bullshit?
[343:29.47]34?
[343:29.49]What is this horseshit?
[343:30.57]I have to go for another one.
[343:48.95]I think it's magic.
[343:49.47]You have to do magic damage to it.
[343:51.78]But nobody here really has very much magic damage.
[343:53.98]Rock candy?
[344:05.27]Yeah, I don't think I have any more rock candies.
[344:07.29]I have fire bombs, though.
[344:09.59]Let's see if I have any more.
[344:11.20]Oh, no, I just got the preview.
[344:12.16]You're right, yeah.
[344:27.17]There it is.
[344:28.11]Alright.
[344:29.37]And let's do the fire bomb.
[344:30.91]Go for it.
[344:36.69]Use all my items.
[344:37.45]This is the hardest boss in the game.
[344:39.48]The actual last boss is not even close to as hard as this.
[344:52.14]Let's heal Mario.
[344:58.97]Did I miss that?
[345:06.49]Alright, what's next?
[345:07.11]Probably... Earth.
[345:07.67]Yeah.
[345:08.00]That 360... Let's burn this.
[345:11.94]Yoshi candy?
[345:13.04]Alright, I'm gonna use the Yoshi candy on Mario.
[345:30.56]Wish me luck.
[345:31.08]I actually don't even know what this does.
[345:40.95]100 HP.
[345:47.63]Kills you instantly.
[345:48.51]That'd be bad.
[345:52.81]Flashed.
[345:58.38]Come back.
[346:15.32]You know, in all the years that I've played this game, I don't know what that does.
[346:21.84]It doesn't seem to do anything.
[346:23.34]The Shredder.
[346:24.92]Does it take FP?
[346:27.24]Does it... I don't know what it does.
[346:31.57]It takes away all your buffs.
[346:32.81]Um, okay.
[346:40.54]What is this song called?
[346:41.80]Ah, this song is probably just called Koolex's Fight Theme, I'm assuming?
[346:47.19]Koolex Battle?
[346:47.91]Final Fantasy IV boss theme?
[347:11.24]Uh, everyone's fine except Bowser.
[347:21.68]And then we'd have to deal with only Culex.
[347:25.31]It shouldn't take very long.
[347:26.21]It's the crystals that give him all the power.
[347:30.03]Did I do lucky?
[347:32.23]Just in case I don't remember.
[347:33.21]Did I?
[347:33.65]Let's do it.
[347:50.34]Shit, I missed it again He thinks Nintendo made this game, but Nintendo did not make this game
[348:07.69]This is a Squaresoft game.
[348:16.16]Nintendo just said, Alright.
[348:20.24]This is before the Enix merge.
[348:33.23]It's a Square FromSoftware game.
[348:37.16]I don't know why did that hurt my head thinking of the thing you just said.
[348:40.48]It's a From Soft Square software.
[348:42.80]I have no idea what you said.
[348:43.95]I said it, but I'm freaking out now.
[348:52.41]Flame Crystal going down, and then it's just Culex.
[348:54.51]And then you get something.
[349:04.06]Let's let Peach give it a whirl.
[349:07.50]66 damage, not bad.
[349:19.66]Alright.
[349:20.87]Just you and me, Koolex.
[349:26.09]And what do I want?
[349:27.39]Let's just whack him.
[349:35.80]You don't have any of your cool gadgets anymore.
[349:40.88]You just are going to take damage until you're dead.
[349:51.11]Bowser is in trouble.
[349:52.65]It's alright.
[349:56.17]Just do the group.
[350:11.87]He doomed this world by breaking the crystals.
[350:17.72]Well, maybe his world.
[350:21.78]My world's gonna be alright, I think, because we're not in my world right now.
[350:25.28]We're very clearly somewhere else.
[350:31.88]He rented out an apartment in Monstro Town and made a big black hole over here.
[350:36.11]This is not even Monstro Town.
[350:37.31]Did I miss that?
[350:56.93]Won't be long now.
[350:57.65]Another two, three rounds should be it.
[351:01.17]348.
[351:07.08]Goodbye.
[351:07.72]244 EXP.
[351:07.82]Double it.
[351:25.02]Pay attention, because this is like 500 experience.
[351:27.94]Here we go.
[351:34.32]Hahaha.
[351:54.20]Oh shit, that's kind of split.
[352:00.00]I don't know guys, that's... Okay, alright.
[352:10.00]That's a majority.
[352:13.18]Ooh! Nooo.
[352:49.59]Twenty-one.
[352:50.16]Might as well keep it up.
[352:53.70]Twenty-four.
[352:55.68]He got so high because he has this thing on.
[353:02.79]22.
[353:02.87]How is her reg- her regular defense is terrible.
[353:06.21]I'm gonna go- I have to- she has to get a couple of points in that shit Not like it matters, the game's over Everybody leveled up from that Your spirit is strong Thank you, brave knight
[353:30.95]I will treasure this memento of my journey here.
[353:34.56]Perhaps in another time, another game, we may have been mortal enemies, but as part, as comrades in arms.
[353:47.49]Take this.
[353:49.29]Treasure it as a keepsake of our fight.
[353:55.51]Kulak's decided.
[353:57.45]On his own.
[353:58.34]Nobody told him to do it.
[354:00.26]He gave a quartz charm to Mario.
[354:04.82]Beautiful stuff.
[354:11.71]Farewell, Champion Knight.
[354:23.50]It's blue text I got, and plus, it's fun to make people very angry at me.
[354:27.14]Alright, so that's Guilexi.
[354:31.76]Close the door.
[354:32.28]There's the quartz charm.
[354:37.74]Shining source of power.
[354:40.65]Now, it might look like it's not very good.
[354:49.09]And in fact, I'm not even entirely sure exactly what this does.
[355:22.64]220, 205.
[355:22.78]I'm ready.
[355:25.40]Deal 50% more damage and take 50% less damage and prevents instant death.
[355:28.85]Well, that's incredible.
[355:32.33]Use Geno.
[355:32.85]Bowser sucks.
[355:34.55]Alright, hold on.
[355:37.03]For the final... Geno has to be in the party for the final fight.
[355:42.06]I agree.
[356:44.10]Okay.
[356:45.96]Here's the final party.
[356:47.56]The original three from the very beginning of the game.
[356:50.57]Malo, Geno, and Mario.
[357:06.66]Plus, I'm gonna have to be fair with my party here.
[357:10.36]Peach has been in the party for the last, like, six or seven straight in-video game hours.
[357:18.58]Bowser was in the first.
[357:20.06]You know, we have not seen very much Mallow in that party.
[357:23.42]It's Mario and two nobodies.
[357:35.71]Heals?
[357:36.49]Malo has a heal as well.
[357:37.26]Let's go!
[357:46.08]You have to make your party who is currently playable in Smash.
[357:55.16]Come on.
[357:56.87]You're gonna... You... Really?
[357:58.91]Really?
[358:00.85]That's not a very nice thing to say to me.
[358:03.21]You know I'm a HUGE Geno fan.
[358:24.55]Sans got in Smash before Juno.
[358:26.41]Yeah.
[358:26.73]LOL, Juno didn't get in Smash before Sans.
[358:35.95]Funny.
[358:46.58]Gino's in Smash as a costume.
[358:47.85]No, he's not.
[358:48.75]He was in the old one.
[358:50.51]Why did you make him in the new one with the costume?
[358:53.31]What's going on there?
[358:54.11]Why can't they just put the costume in the new one?
[358:57.70]Why?
[359:02.74]That doesn't seem right.
[359:21.45]Blame square.
[359:22.21]That's so much damage.
[359:28.73]Okay, this is going to be embarrassing how quickly I beat this last boss.
[359:32.83]This is the final boss of the game, and I'm going to steamroll the final boss.
[359:53.34]I don't.
[360:31.80]That's a cool looking enemy.
[360:32.74]Hold on.
[360:33.35]Oh, if you want to see how the other final moves look like, this is Geno's final attack move.
[360:44.34]Shoot stars out of his hands.
[360:46.04]I'm going to beat the boss in like fucking three rounds.
[360:48.24]I'm going to do 1500 damage a turn.
[361:08.23]nine hog a lot of experience mallow that's why okay what do you got let's get you over 150 HP
[361:35.26]Peach would have done more.
[361:36.16]Absolutely.
[361:37.10]Peach is a better character, but that's the thing.
[361:44.46]I need to get some screen time for Mallow, because I want to see his other moves.
[361:49.35]Didn't he get a new super special move?
[362:12.78]Oh, come on!
[362:13.52]I thought I had it.
[362:14.86]It's alright, we'll kill him in two hits.
[362:16.16]Um... Why is Mellow so bad?
[362:47.91]That attack power is not... 4?
[362:50.08]A damage for A?
[362:52.06]That doesn't seem correct.
[362:54.54]He's wearing armor, right?
[362:55.50]My finger slipped.
[363:22.82]Ice Bomb.
[363:23.54]Cool.
[363:26.66]I can use that.
[363:28.48]There we are.
[363:30.14]We can get rid of this, because that's just this playthrough.
[363:32.54]I'm kind of confused what the other ones are for.
[363:35.03]I think one of them is to do the Geno Whirl.
[363:36.57]Okay, let's go.
[363:48.33]Production is on schedule.
[363:50.53]This despite the fact that Mac, Boyer, Yardovich, and the Axum Rangers were defeated.
[363:55.85]At this rate, Smithy will have a new army in no time.
[363:59.59]A new army?
[364:01.07]You can't be making more weapons.
[364:02.43]Haven't you caused enough trouble already?
[364:05.33]Oh yeah?
[364:06.55]Who are you?
[364:08.51]This is Mario.
[364:10.21]Give up now or you still have a chance.
[364:13.84]Shut down production now or I'll stomp you.
[364:17.64]What did you say, you little puffball?
[364:20.86]Mad Mallet!
[364:22.13]Trash him!
[364:45.46]Alright.
[364:46.50]Let's see what you got.
[365:02.85]This is not the final boss.
[365:18.76]It's Shovel Knight.
[365:23.20]Ah, that is actually Shovel Knight.
[365:28.23]He just needs to be blue.
[365:40.98]22.
[365:43.66]Let's round out.
[365:45.90]I need this.
[365:47.84]Mario is so bad in regards to magic.
[365:51.26]Ha.
[365:51.88]Hope you learned your lesson.
[365:54.21]We're almost here, Mario.
[365:55.79]Come on.
[365:56.17]Where do you think this starts?
[366:04.01]Nothing happened.
[366:11.52]Huh?
[366:12.36]What's with the funny face, Mario?
[366:14.58]Oh, I know.
[366:15.38]You're trying to make me look, aren't you?
[366:17.44]I'm not going to fall for that one.
[366:20.36]Wait, help!
[366:21.30]Help me!
[366:22.00]Help me!
[366:22.57]Help me!
[366:23.11]Help me!
[366:23.65]Help me!
[366:25.85]Oh, that was scary.
[366:27.41]I guess the green switch controls are the cranes.
[366:33.63]Mario!
[366:35.80]No, Mario!
[366:40.04]I...
[366:41.73]I hate to beat the whole game.
[366:43.09]All these things respawn.
[366:46.85]I finally made it here.
[366:49.73]Let me help you.
[366:51.59]Mario.
[366:55.18]Princess.
[366:58.88]I'm sorry I snuck out without telling you or the Chancellor.
[367:02.90]I just wanted things to get back to normal.
[367:05.06]I wanted to do my part to help.
[367:09.76]Princess.
[367:11.68]Yeah, that's... That's it?
[367:14.12]Any job that lets me help both Mario and the princess is worth doing.
[367:17.56]My voice won't do it.
[367:18.56]I'm trying to do that.
[367:19.85]I can't do it.
[367:21.81]You're gonna help both of us.
[367:24.25]Well, I carried all I could.
[367:26.55]Now what can you use?
[367:37.40]I got maybe a couple of these.
[367:38.76]Maybe a couple of these.
[367:39.59]A couple of these.
[367:41.59]That's all I need, man.
[367:44.29]Toad, I really don't want to say this to you, but... You wasted all week getting here.
[367:50.91]I don't need any of this stuff.
[367:52.36]I was alright.
[367:54.38]I just came from beating Culex.
[367:55.80]He's a Final Fantasy IV boss.
[367:58.44]I don't need any more mid-mushrooms.
[368:00.00]I'm sorry.
[368:00.98]I'm buying them because I'm going to feel bad for you.
[368:06.47]This is for you.
[368:07.04]Oh, raw candy.
[368:11.82]Thanks, Toad.
[368:23.33]Thank you, Toad.
[368:25.63]We're almost there.
[368:27.21]Come on, let's go.
[368:28.11]Let's show him.
[368:30.01]Toad has joined your party.
[368:32.18]Why wouldn't Toad be in the party?
[368:36.14]I'm just thinking about this, and this is kind of strange to me.
[368:40.11]There are five party... Why wouldn't you get a nice, clean, rounded six?
[368:46.25]Or even seven, with Luigi.
[368:48.67]That's confusing.
[368:54.26]Here's your report.
[368:57.66]Sir, Drill Bit will be finished on time.
[369:02.84]We're ahead of schedule.
[369:05.64]We'll make Smithy proud.
[369:09.31]Good work, everyone.
[369:11.21]The harder we work, the stronger Smithy will become.
[369:15.27]It's me, actual Shovel Knight, this time.
[369:19.19]The weapons we manufacture here will be just think of it.
[369:24.42]When Smithy takes over Mario's world, we can do anything we want.
[369:35.42]Funny.
[369:36.40]Someone just did a funny joke.
[369:40.98]Not so fast.
[369:42.58]You sure are a cocky bunch.
[369:51.73]I rule this world, don't you forget it.
[369:54.91]It's Mario.
[369:56.69]Mac 2 and Yardovich 2 didn't stop him.
[370:02.75]No, no leave Mario out of this I'm the only one you need to worry about not him Mario you're about to make the longest jump of your life You're ignoring me Oh, it's okay we'll get it with the genome flash
[370:36.49]Shovel Knight Goddess is smashed before Geno did.
[370:46.58]I'm going to start handing out permabands.
[370:50.72]Cut it out.
[371:14.96]That sucked.
[371:20.57]Mallow might actually not be very good, huh?
[371:28.78]Damn.
[371:29.28]I might have to bring back Peach.
[371:45.22]I just did use a spell.
[371:48.42]Ah, well.
[372:00.73]Like, uh...
[372:15.99]Like the moon over... Like the... Like the moon over the day.
[372:22.78]My genius and brawn are lost on these fools.
[372:26.60]That's a small haiku that I wrote.
[372:28.90]It had nothing to do with the game.
[372:30.08]I just, as the narrator, decided to come in and give you some knowledge.
[372:46.95]Oh, everybody hates that so much, and like, I can't stop doing it.
[372:54.95]You there!
[372:56.31]Are you the one in charge here?
[372:58.27]Do you know what your weapons have been doing to our world?
[373:01.17]Stop this nonsense at once!
[373:07.15]I'm afraid that isn't possible.
[373:09.47]Any dissent against Smithy will be dealt with by immediate meltdown.
[373:17.38]Meltdown?
[373:18.60]You can't scare me.
[373:19.32]I've got Mario by my side.
[373:22.23]Dissenters will be eliminated.
[373:24.71]Production will continue.
[373:50.72]I really... I really hope I... I really hope there's no more blue text in the game.
[373:56.53]I hope that's the last of the, uh, of Narrator Blue Text Trump.
[374:09.51]Mallow... You are so bad!
[374:32.99]Oh, that's right, he does have the Lazy Shell on, so that makes him almost 100% useless.
[374:40.33]Right.
[374:40.83]Malo cannot have this.
[374:42.59]It makes him almost totally useless.
[374:45.37]He only has HP Rain, though.
[374:51.15]Yeah, I guess I've got to bring in Peach.
[374:53.20]This is the worst spell.
[374:58.06]It's his final move!
[374:59.22]It's like the best, it's his final smash!
[375:14.25]That was scary.
[375:15.85]But we can't run away now.
[375:17.70]We've got to kick these lowlifes out of our world.
[375:44.98]We're going straight up just absolute DPS.
[375:56.28]Wartstrom, Jinx, Bell, Tax Carp.
[376:00.71]Jerma, you're using the wrong spell.
[376:22.90]Mario.
[376:25.10]I'm surprised to see you here.
[376:28.32]This is the end of the line for you.
[376:31.28]This is the closest you'll ever get to Smithy.
[376:34.38]So savor the moment.
[376:38.58]You'll be fodder for my incredible invention.
[376:41.72]The gun yoke.
[376:54.34]I just don't want him to see it.
[376:55.38]You know?
[376:58.32]I don't want him to see us destroying his invention.
[377:03.34]Ow.
[377:05.12]This is a DPS.
[377:07.34]You see what I'm saying?
[377:08.84]You see what I'm talking about here?
[377:11.24]We're doing pure hundreds of damage each second.
[377:15.18]How much DPS is this?
[377:23.40]Well, we're down to about, like, 12.
[377:28.06]I think it's, like, we're about 5 damage per second at this point.
[377:55.91]If only Peach could heal.
[377:57.67]But I'm not going to need it.
[378:07.02]Pure DPS.
[378:14.58]All three of them might die right now.
[378:19.33]No.
[378:20.17]We're good.
[378:26.82]Sometimes it's that was you so quick that was Damaged The production line hasn't halted look Mario this is where the weapons come from This must be with Smitty makes his weapons I
[378:57.61]Define the last star piece and stop the factory.
[379:01.55]We've got to defeat him first.
[379:04.13]Mario.
[379:05.84]There's no turning back now.
[379:07.98]Are you ready?
[379:11.08]Our quest is almost over.
[379:13.56]And when the time comes... Come on.
[379:19.87]Let's get this show on the run.
[380:06.01]Here we go Here we go Joel Joel just came in with a raid right now Right at the perfect moment What's going on everybody?
[380:31.56]Thanks Joel.
[380:32.50]Hope you had a good stream
[380:34.78]We are currently finishing Super Mario RPG.
[380:37.06]This is the, uh, by the way, hold on, wait, wait, stop, uh, um... If you've never played Mario RPG before, uh, you just walked into the theater in the last ten seconds of, like, Infinity War.
[380:50.47]I'm, um... Okay, so, this is the la- this is the final battle of Mario RPG.
[380:58.46]Here we go.
[381:01.88]Uh, welcome!
[381:02.98]You ready?
[381:06.02]Turns out it's fuckin' Santa Claus.
[381:08.78]Hey!
[381:10.88]There's the last star piece.
[381:17.41]What, huh?
[381:20.51]Already finished your tour of the factory, huh?
[381:23.61]Alright then.
[381:25.22]How about a little demonstration?
[381:28.26]Hey, yo, Smitty!
[381:34.06]Stop making those things and hand over the star piece now.
[381:39.76]Yeah.
[381:41.23]Huh?
[381:44.37]Oh, so you're the Mario.
[381:47.09]Looks like we're going to have a little dispute over this star.
[381:53.49]Just hand it over and get out of my castle.
[381:57.42]My, my, we're a little touchy today, aren't we?
[382:01.62]You know, I'm actually growing rather fond of this place.
[382:07.93]Please, don't make us go through anymore.
[382:10.15]Just give us the star now.
[382:15.87]Better yet, why don't you give me all of your stars?
[382:21.84]Then I could easily conquer the world.
[382:24.91]Then we can get rid of all these wishes and create a world filled with weapons.
[382:34.04]Over here now, I'll crush you all.
[382:43.01]Oh, why can't we have five people at the party?
[382:44.79]Here we go, best song in the game.
[383:07.36]Sledge.
[383:11.44]That didn't hurt.
[383:13.32]That should- you know what, just keep- just keep healing.
[383:20.86]Let's shut off your... weapon foul, I think.
[383:23.96]That's probably a good idea.
[383:32.61]First time we've seen that move.
[383:33.85]It hurts!
[383:36.03]Everybody but Peach, obviously.
[383:39.47]Uh-oh.
[383:49.60]That's all you made?
[383:51.56]Well, that's kind of... That's kind of shitty, I'm not gonna lie.
[383:56.83]You can make anything.
[384:04.93]Let's see what this does.
[384:13.21]What do you think's been making all these bad guys for the whole game?
[384:24.86]You know, when I was younger, I truly did not understand that he was, like, a Smith.
[384:31.80]I thought he was, like, that was a last name.
[384:33.78]Like, oh, it's Smitty!
[384:36.04]Like, his name was, like, Dan Smith.
[384:39.77]I did not get it when I was, like, 12 or 13.
[384:49.04]Dan... Dan Smithy!
[385:02.80]I didn't get it when I was 26.
[385:03.81]Alright, that's a little different.
[385:08.57]I wanna... okay, it's shut off now.
[385:12.57]Let's get rid of that little guy, because now he can't make any more.
[385:16.49]That's a one-hit KO.
[385:29.26]I just got it.
[385:33.13]Oh, so he's like a blacksmith.
[385:36.57]Oh.
[385:41.19]Really?
[385:41.63]Hold on, wait a minute.
[385:47.36]You're telling me Dan Smith is a blacksmith?
[385:50.38]That's fucking crazy.
[385:52.16]That's crazy.
[385:55.14]That was pretty good.
[386:13.73]Mega drink.
[386:14.55]Let's let, let's let Peach get a little fucking shot in there.
[386:26.56]Did I already beat the hardest boss?
[386:33.62]I did.
[386:34.04]I did.
[386:35.34]Uh, no, let's just keep it up.
[386:54.59]Calm down, Smitty.
[386:56.27]Your head looks like a geyser.
[387:00.93]Don't get so worked up.
[387:03.13]Think of your blood pressure.
[387:08.85]We just built this yesterday, and the foundation's very weak.
[387:13.61]So stop shaking the floor.
[387:17.77]How utterly annoying.
[387:23.77]Huh?
[387:25.45]What the?
[387:27.73]How in the heck?
[387:32.72]Fuck!
[387:35.06]Fuck!
[387:35.72]Fuck!
[387:36.34]Shit!
[387:36.98]Fuck!
[387:37.72]Oh shit!
[387:39.10]Oh!
[387:40.50]Ow!
[387:43.56]No!
[387:53.96]I'm burning.
[387:55.60]I'm sinking.
[387:58.98]Never have I been so wronged.
[388:01.75]It is time.
[388:03.77]I will show you my real form.
[388:07.21]I will show you my true power.
[388:09.35]I will teach you respect.
[388:12.43]And I shall have my revenge.
[388:43.37]I can take you all... at the same time!
[389:00.59]Now this is actually the best song.
[389:42.96]Can't block it.
[389:43.63]Uh, let's shut him off.
[389:52.29]Yoko Shimomura was pumping out bangers before Kingdom Hearts?
[389:55.14]Oh, yeah.
[389:55.76]Oh, he's supposed to heal.
[389:58.68]Oh, let's go with an Ultra Jump.
[390:23.57]Cat!
[390:24.93]Move!
[390:34.23]That was so mu- Beach has the lazy shell on it.
[390:36.69]You know how much damage that is?
[390:38.70]In fact, let's, uh...
[391:00.37]582 damage.
[391:01.49]That was big.
[391:11.73]582.
[391:14.68]Back to the... Oh, no.
[391:15.64]Stay there.
[391:16.06]That's fine.
[391:19.90]This thing takes the most damage.
[391:21.38]I might kill you before you even get a chance to go to the end of the phase.
[391:24.58]Just keep doing over 500 damage each hit.
[391:30.13]These specials are no reason to.
[391:33.57]They do way more, like Mario does five, they might, doing like a super jump or an ultra jump or a flame is only gonna do like 200 damage to this guy.
[391:42.66]Same thing with like Geno at this point, like Geno blast, Geno blast, they're just not worth doing.
[391:46.36]You can just do so much more.
[391:47.90]446, that's it.
[391:48.96]It's over.
[391:49.70]I just beat the game.
[391:54.13]I am burning with power.
[391:56.23]No, I'm just kidding.
[391:57.07]That wasn't live.
[391:57.73]I thought that was it.
[392:20.95]And we're gonna change to the mailbox.
[392:25.31]Or whatever the hell that is.
[392:26.25]Is it a treasure chest?
[392:41.88]I know.
[392:42.92]That's a mailbox, ever since I was a little kid.
[392:45.58]Can't be anything else to me.
[392:51.00]Uh, there's a really weird looking one, isn't there?
[393:13.89]Isn't there a fourth one that we haven't seen yet?
[393:18.70]There's the mailbox, the tank, the magician head, and I think there's another one.
[393:27.83]Getting close.
[393:52.07]And... no, that's not it?
[393:53.77]Alright, well, this is at least 2,000-3,000 damage here.
[393:57.17]Let's Groot Bug it.
[394:00.35]690 damage for one attack.
[394:16.24]That might be the... I mean, I'm gonna be real with you.
[394:18.46]That might be the single biggest damage attack I've ever done.
[394:25.89]With just a standard attack, it was 700 damage.
[394:31.13]Oh shit, you're right!
[394:31.93]You're right, you're right, you're right!
[394:32.75]I forgot!
[394:33.55]I still have these!
[394:34.77]Uh... Carioco Cola!
[394:39.45]Quick, use them before the game ends!
[394:46.02]seven hundred thirty eight my body and head are burning it's not possible I don't believe it I'm finished and done for
[395:23.40]Come on, Mario.
[395:26.27]Send the last one way up.
[395:55.07]His hands look like McDonald's french fries.
[395:58.13]Don't ruin this.
[395:58.91]This is a very emotional part of the game.
[396:03.33]All seven pieces.
[396:15.78]Thank you, everyone.
[396:19.08]The Star Road is back to normal.
[396:22.30]And...
[396:43.50]oh here we go goodbye
[397:26.00]Take care, guys.
[397:28.85]You'll never fucking see me again.
[397:34.53]But, I heard, just please, just beg Sakurai for me to be in the next game.
[397:40.65]Put me in something else, please.
[397:41.93]Did you see my hand cannon?
[397:44.25]Did you see my finger guns and shit?
[397:51.32]This is all I got.
[397:53.52]I'll say, uh, somebody please.
[398:16.35]He was a cool guy, wasn't he?
[398:28.91]Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[398:30.21]This is important stuff!
[398:34.43]Hooray!
[398:35.05]I am the king now!
[398:42.52]Haha!
[398:44.16]Yay!
[398:45.34]You ain't ever gonna see me again either!
[398:48.52]Bye!
[398:48.98]My story's complete!
[398:50.12]There's no reason to keep this going ever again!
[399:04.14]I like this part.
[399:08.78]Story is complete though, I guess.
[399:16.70]Fucking Johnny Jonathan Jones gets more screen time in the end than Geno.
[399:21.98]They'll put him in Smash.
[399:23.62]He'll be a fucking assist trophy next year.
[399:34.69]Wait, is that implying that he poisoned Yoshi?
[399:43.18]Oh, we didn't complete Todovsky.
[399:56.69]There was one more song to do.
[399:57.87]Oh, oh well.
[400:16.06]They're perfect for each other, aren't they?
[400:19.06]Thank you for playing.
[400:23.64]Hey, guys.
[400:46.41]Remember that guy that's in the green shirt?
[400:50.66]Brother to the guy we played all game?
[400:54.30]There he is!
[400:55.16]It's Luigi!
[401:02.31]He's been running the marching band the whole game!
[401:11.75]Let's go!
[401:12.31]Let's go!
[401:24.79]There's- there's Malo.
[401:26.23]Get outta here!
[401:43.50]Please don't make Let's Go a thing.
[401:53.46]Why would I ever do that again?
[402:05.20]It's too late.
[402:08.14]I love the little pixel characters, like Croco.
[402:25.88]Balloons!
[402:27.60]His booster on the train!
[402:46.07]And the Snippets and the Beatles.
[402:48.87]I remember these guys.
[403:03.73]What's at the very end of this?
[403:05.81]All the bosses?
[403:06.71]We're gonna see Mac.
[403:08.48]Yes, we are.
[403:09.22]There they go, all of them.
[403:36.53]Mac Yardovich Boyer Smithy Blade John
[404:07.07]And there's Gino.
[404:09.59]You thought it was over.
[404:10.85]You didn't think we were going to get a Magic Kingdom Disney night light-up LED parade.
[404:16.68]Well, I'm sorry.
[404:21.02]You were wrong. ...
[404:36.17]This is adorable.
[404:37.01]Oh, it's, yeah, it's great.
[404:38.83]It's wonderful.
[404:47.70]Even the toads have glowing hats, yeah.
[404:53.72]I just want this to be real.
[404:57.88]Why can't that be, like, a Super Mario one?
[404:59.58]It needs to be a Nintendo theme park.
[405:07.08]They will be yeah Goodbye gino
[405:51.93]One, two, three, four.
[405:55.57]There's the fireworks.
[405:56.33]Come on, where's the finale?
[405:59.57]Did I not do enough secrets?
[406:00.64]Oh, I didn't do the carbo cover.
[406:18.13]Toad.
[406:49.68]The end.
[406:53.10]He became a D. Why did you do that, Geno?
[406:57.27]Why did you turn yourself into a D and explode when you could have been in like 15 other games?
[407:01.91]Was it really worth being the D?
[407:03.11]People would have got the picture.
[407:03.97]They would have understood.
[407:06.49]So you panicked right there.
[407:07.39]You ran at it like juice.
[407:08.25]You got to the end.
[407:09.97]And you freaked out.
[407:10.55]That's the end.
[407:40.06]This is going to make me cry, bro.
[407:45.25]Yeah, that was Super Mario RPG.
[407:50.15]It's one of my favorite games ever.
[407:52.41]I'm so happy to be able to play it with all of you.
[407:59.56]So thank you for sharing one of my favorite things ever.
[408:05.54]I'm going to go try to do 100 jumps like twice, and then I'm going to give up.
[408:08.57]And end the stream.
[408:32.12]No, what the fuck did I just do?
[408:34.38]Did I just open up Star Fox?
[408:44.30]Okay.
[408:50.26]I'm gonna mute all sound.
[408:53.33]I'm gonna take this out of my headphones.
[408:55.83]And I'm gonna do it just by sight alone.
[409:05.12]That's not gonna work.
[409:06.02]It should, but it shouldn't.
[409:08.94]Don't mute.
[409:09.74]Hold on.
[409:09.96]Hold on, hold on.
[409:11.00]I don't even know fucking how many that was.
[409:40.61]21.
[409:40.65]This shit is fucking impossible.
[409:51.78]32?
[409:57.62]I don't know how... How in the name of God does somebody do this a hundred times in a row?
[410:06.80]reliably every time I can't even imagine you've got to be you've got to see the world in not only do you probably because you see the world in 4k and everything is slowed down by like 72 percent 4d world alright hold on let me I'm gonna try a different tactic here
[410:43.53]No.
[410:45.69]It's a simple tempo.
[410:46.69]It is not.
[410:49.31]The timing changes to essentially a single frame after, I believe, 12 jumps.
[411:00.96]It is not a tempo.
[411:04.17]It does not have anything to do with the sound.
[411:06.51]It has nothing to do with the tempo.
[411:08.51]It's about... Because it changes.
[411:22.04]It's the same window every time, but that window is so small.
[411:25.72]I'm going to try doing it a little bit after.
[411:36.01]Let's see.
[411:42.01]No, you can't do it after because you lose the frame data from... You can't do it.
[411:53.53]Just push Y. Look up the YouTube tutorial.
[411:59.06]I'll look it up after this.
[412:12.17]Poor Bowser.
[412:19.23]The tutorial is useless, is it?
[412:46.69]I wonder.
[412:48.81]Because essentially, from my understanding, right when you can see Mario's shoe, right there, there, right there, that's when you're supposed to press it.
[412:58.58]But I feel like I'm doing it.
[413:00.96]At least after you get past 15.
[413:09.24]The shoe is the key.
[413:20.80]What the fuck?
[413:28.58]I'm gonna try this like two more times.
[413:34.13]I feel like the area as well.
[413:37.17]Like the background image is like adds to a problem.
[413:49.45]Because I got to 37 against the Axiom Rangers.
[413:51.69]How?
[413:55.75]Oh, I'm out of juice here.
[414:00.03]Hold on, let me see something here.
[414:05.28]I need to plug this in.
[414:06.74]Alright, let me try to get at least a 20.
[414:17.50]Because it actually, the timing changes two times.
[414:22.40]It's like the middle coming down for the first like eight and then it shrinks from like eight or something to like 15 and then it shrinks to tiny from like 18 all the way up.
[414:37.82]I remember looking this up years ago.
[415:14.19]Make a robot that pushes the button at the exact time.
[415:19.10]If I have any leftover cash, maybe.
[415:33.02]Alright.
[415:35.87]I can say there's no chance in hell I'm going to do this a hundred times.
[415:40.77]On a single frame.
[415:42.15]This is not going to happen.
[415:52.38]Oh, that attitude?
[415:53.26]Oh, not ever.
[415:56.14]What if I spam it?
[415:57.74]You know what I mean?
[415:58.78]Does that matter?
[415:59.72]Let's see what happens.
[416:02.18]Nope.
[416:08.37]I'm going to watch the tutorial.
[416:11.07]I want to see if I have this correct.
[416:12.83]I want to make sure I have it correct.
[416:26.09]Super jump tutorial.
[416:34.14]Okay, let's put it on here.
[416:48.56]OK.
[416:55.14]Is it on the screen?
[417:00.05]alright super jumps I'm gonna see if I can help out people having trouble getting the timing right with these jumps some people are usually a lot of people say they can't get up raises get an accessory that only Mario can wear that raises all of the super uh your stats benefits as this image will attack phone
[417:32.44]The bars you see represent the earliest time you can press Y to jump, depending on how many jumps you've done so far.
[417:38.36]The yellow bar is the first through about the sixth jump.
[417:41.24]After the sixth jump, this timing bracket will shrink down to where the orange bar is, which represents the seventh through about the fifteenth jump.
[417:49.57]The orange bar is the earliest you can hit the Y button at this point.
[417:54.26]The red line represents the final timing change that messes people up.
[417:57.86]You have just a couple frames to make your marks, so you gotta be perfect.
[418:01.56]Notice that the bars have lined up with Mario's feet, so the button press is occurring when Mario is literally on top of the enemy, and not right before like with the orange bar.
[418:10.47]This is the first jump we're looking at, so I'm going to continue the footage in slow motion while counting the jumps and actively showing you the timing changes.
[418:20.51]Fuck.
[418:21.51]This is a lot of info.
[418:22.23]Six.
[418:22.31]Seven.
[418:22.51]Okay.
[418:22.83]Eight.
[418:22.99]Nine.
[418:23.19]Eleven.
[418:23.45]Twelve.
[418:23.62]Thirteen.
[418:23.94]Sixteen.
[418:47.21]Alright, I'm gonna go to 25 because I don't need to animate 44 jumps.
[419:04.89]I feel like that's what I'm doing, though.
[419:06.51]Fuck!
[419:09.09]Alright, let's...
[419:16.88]So after... Let's see, so it's... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... What the fuck?
[419:30.96]I didn't change anything!
[419:32.22]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm just going... Press my button to see where you need...
[420:10.69]Five, six, seven, eight.
[420:21.78]God damn it, man!
[420:46.39]I am trying so fucking hard.
[420:50.83]This shit is fucking ridiculous.
[420:55.71]I also have to take into account, like, the delay going... into... You know, that, there, you know what?
[421:04.75]That is very possible.
[421:07.03]The tiny little delay going from the Super Nintendo into the Elgato into my monitor.
[421:17.12]Uh-oh.
[421:19.36]That's true.
[421:20.23]That makes, like, a little bit of sense.
[421:24.27]That makes sense.
[421:25.25]It does.
[421:26.45]As to why it can't be, like, super duper ultra hyper hyper hyper perfect.
[421:32.41]It's because of that.
[421:35.05]Maybe.
[421:38.45]Don't do it visually?
[421:39.17]Well, you can't do it with audio.
[421:48.61]Um... Change your timing.
[421:54.50]Yeah, but I'm... That's... Just change your timing, forehead.
[421:58.58]That doesn't work as easy as you think it does.
[422:02.57]I'm losing two or three frames.
[422:14.25]So that means I'd have to do it, like, two or three frames early, right?
[422:20.22]That's the theory?
[422:29.89]Let me see what happens if I try to, like, a hair early instead of trying to do it right when he lands.
[422:34.05]Let's try it again.
[422:35.43]Alright, this is the final attempt.
[422:59.54]Is the Elgato fucking screwing me up here?
[423:02.38]I'm gonna, hold on.
[423:03.36]I'm gonna, I'm going for a, I'm gonna delete the game.
[423:06.95]I'm gonna turn my webcam so you can see.
[423:08.55]I'm going right from, I'm going from the Super Nintendo right into the monitor and I'm turning my fucking camera on webcam so you can see.
[423:16.57]I wanna see if that helps.
[423:17.30]I'm real, I'm actually curious about that.
[423:30.88]Because I'm going... Let's go out of here.
[423:32.82]Alright, hold on a second.
[423:35.85]And you know what?
[423:37.15]The stream's over right now anyways, right?
[423:38.98]Like, the stream's over.
[423:40.75]I'll see you tomorrow.
[423:42.03]Etalyx and I are going to play Man of Medan tomorrow.
[423:46.99]That like horror co-op.
[423:48.55]Choose who lives and choose who dies.
[423:51.32]So that should be fun.
[423:52.56]But let me go to the bathroom.
[423:53.98]Let me come back.
[423:54.50]I'm going to switch this up.
[423:55.72]And we'll do like the after stream party.
[423:58.92]Where we do this and we'll read bits.
[424:01.35]So I will see you guys very soon.
[426:59.03]you
[428:04.99]Why does this look like such shit?
[428:11.41]Oh no, it looks alright.
[428:16.43]Okay.
[428:17.34]You guys can't hear anything, and neither can I. What is going on?
[428:27.42]Why did it just do that?
[428:34.45]Why did it just do that?
[428:35.63]Why does it look like this?
[428:36.53]No.
[429:00.91]No, I just, I just, I'm just incapable.
[429:03.59]I'm just not, I'm just in-fucking-capable.
[429:06.28]Alright, we figured it out.
[429:08.14]Just incapable of doing the hundred super jump, uh, thing.
[429:32.06]Did you sit on the screen?
[429:37.14]Why is this boss so fucking hard?
[429:41.33]I know, I keep doing my moves to him, but I keep doing zero damage.
[429:52.39]Now, I can 100... If somebody said, Jeremy, I will donate to you right now.
[430:01.11]$10,000 if you do this.
[430:02.77]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[430:04.27]I feel like I didn't change anything.
[430:29.85]It feels like my timings are getting lost somehow.
[430:32.52]This is the last attempt, and I'm out of here.
[431:05.81]Ooh!
[431:07.53]That was fucking pretty good.
[431:27.30]So what I started doing there is I started to press Y right as I was touching the top of his bulbous head there.
[431:39.43]Like right when I started to graze the top of his head as I'm pressing Y. Oh fuck, what am I doing?
[432:31.77]I had to itch my fucking face.
[432:33.23]Turn it off.
[432:43.71]Four, five.
[432:55.87]20, 21, 22, three, 34, 25, 26, 27.
[433:38.26]I gotta do this 50 more goddamn times.
[433:44.81]You know what I'm gonna do?
[433:45.61]I'm gonna press start, like, now.
[433:49.73]You know what I'm saying?
[433:53.46]Let's see.
[433:53.88]If I get to 75, I'll do it.
[434:01.32]I'm gonna stop it at about, like, three seconds left.
[434:05.15]I'm gonna try to get it on the way up, not the way down.
[434:23.80]Fuck!
[434:24.86]No!
[434:25.62]How many was that?
[434:31.74]Was that 60?
[434:32.12]Alright, same thing.
[434:40.63]I'm gonna stop at about three seconds, four seconds.
[434:46.49]Why does this look so fucking stupid?
[434:52.81]Why does it look like that?
[434:53.69]Alright, here we go.
[435:17.93]Oh, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[435:20.05]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[435:26.26]I'm at like 60.
[435:27.04]It's the viewing angles on my monitor.
[435:50.89]Well, hold on.
[435:54.20]Put the webcam on top of my head.
[435:55.70]But then I can't focus.
[436:09.71]It's so hard to fucking do that.
[436:12.05]It's so hard to get that, like, exact frame.
[436:14.11]Like, oh, an optical!
[436:15.92]Oh my god, I'm gonna scream.
[436:20.22]What the hell is this?
[436:29.29]Where am I?
[436:41.52]No, that doesn't even help.
[436:48.36]I can't put this anywhere.
[436:49.22]Alright, I'm going to hold it in my fucking mouth after this.
[437:11.26]Can I stream off?
[437:17.99]Can you guys hear me?
[437:24.63]Why can I see the chat?
[437:50.58]What the fuck is going on?
[438:39.39]Hello?
[438:44.84]What the fuck?
[438:45.36]What the hell was that?
[438:50.76]I have to give up.
[438:53.26]No, I think everything's up.
[439:07.11]Hello?
[439:07.57]What the fuck is happening?
[439:14.50]What is going on right now?
[439:17.98]This is going in and out so fast, but my internet's not turning off.
[439:22.01]I think this is like an OBS or a Twitch issue.
[439:45.98]Damn it.
[439:48.43]I don't even know how much that is.
[439:49.47]I think I'm at like 78.
[439:50.05]I'm at 78 or something.
[440:39.37]Okay, here we go.
[440:49.68]It's the second one!
[440:54.70]I can get the fucking first one, but the second one just sucks!
[441:21.33]This viewing angle is so bad.
[441:23.55]I can't.
[441:32.59]I'm going to go into the camera settings.
[441:40.97]I got it.
[441:41.67]If I don't get 10 each time I do this.
[441:51.91]Why?
[441:52.37]Oh, I wasn't even paying attention.
[441:54.61]I'm done.
[441:55.09]I'm out of here.
[441:55.59]I'm fucking leaving.
[441:56.72]I'm not doing this again.
[441:57.46]This is too much.
[442:02.24]This is too much actual, like, living pain.
[442:07.63]Trying to spring in a hundred of these fucking things.
[442:18.37]I'm too close, but it's so, so hard to do what I'm, the stupid way that I'm trying to do this.
[442:27.03]Oh, you can't even see it.
[442:27.73]Never mind.
[442:33.35]I have, if I don't come within like 15, I don't even know how many I've done.
[442:39.59]I can see you shirtless.
[442:40.67]No, I'm not shirtless.
[442:41.65]I got clothes on.
[442:53.25]Alright, here we go.
[442:57.67]Oh my.
[444:00.83]Can you guys not hear me?
[444:03.23]Oh shit, I was muted that whole time, I think.
[444:05.85]I'm sorry.
[444:06.33]I've been talking for, like, at least a full minute.
[444:08.80]Two minutes.
[444:11.22]Wait, was I- I wasn't muted.
[444:12.24]I was muted?
[444:15.17]I'm not still playing.
[444:16.59]Oh my god, I was just talking for so long.
[444:20.23]Alright, so... That was Mario RPG.
[444:26.98]Thanks for watching.
[444:27.46]I'm gonna do the bits.
[444:30.68]Shouldn't take us too long, because we didn't have... I don't think this will take us more than 20-30 minutes or so.
[444:39.61]I wouldn't tell anyone if you use GameShark.
[444:41.29]It's all good.
[444:42.53]Hey, Snixx Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[444:45.75]Here's an update to that sticker car I showed you a month or two ago.
[444:52.23]Oh, your sticker car.
[445:00.24]Jesus.
[445:04.00]What if you ever need to repaint the car?
[445:18.68]When are you going to do another jumping session here?
[445:21.12]I'll show you.
[445:22.72]Thank you for the $5 sticks, Renegade.
[445:26.96]We'll show your bumper sticker car.
[445:33.40]We've got a lot of angles here, too.
[445:43.74]Where is it?
[445:44.38]There it is.
[445:53.64]So what, you added stuff on the front here?
[445:59.88]This is like mini NASCAR.
[446:03.90]Holy shit.
[446:12.19]This is like, is this too many?
[446:22.74]Is this too... I mean, yeah, I think it is.
[446:26.82]I think that's too many.
[446:30.56]Never too many.
[446:36.11]Where's the Jerma985 sticker?
[446:37.47]What the heck, man?
[446:41.05]Thank you.
[446:42.27]And good luck with your soon-to-be-potential polka dot card.
[446:54.74]Thank you to Drummage Door for the $2.50.
[446:58.76]Now, you might be experiencing RPG fatigue, but since you enjoyed this so much, you might want to check out Barkley Shut Up and Jam.
[447:06.23]It's a free, humoristic, post-apocalyptic basketball RPG.
[447:11.13]You can play it even if you don't know much about basketball.
[447:15.26]I have heard of that game.
[447:19.69]But I think we're going to be away from RPG games for a little bit, just for a little while.
[447:27.54]Because this was three streams in a row.
[447:30.94]So I want to take a break from role-playing games while we do some other stuff.
[447:35.72]The old, I'll look into it, yeah.
[447:42.66]But thank you.
[447:43.14]Hold on, my chest burps.
[447:49.53]P.S.
[447:49.81]You won't play Lisa RPG, you uncultured brute.
[447:53.53]I don't think I will.
[447:55.63]Not on stream.
[447:58.81]But thank you to Gunther for the $5.10.
[448:01.15]Here's to September.
[448:02.21]Thank you.
[448:04.17]Thanks for the $5.10.
[448:05.43]Thanks for your subscription that you did twice.
[448:10.39]$5.10.
[448:10.59]An anonymous cheer.
[448:13.36]Thanks for the $2.50.
[448:15.75]They don't say anything.
[448:16.57]Just anonymous.
[448:17.91]And they cheered.
[448:18.39]$2.50.
[448:18.83]Thank you to Halo Softboy for the $2.49.
[448:28.45]I'm not supposed to be reading this one.
[448:32.43]Excuse me.
[448:33.07]You're breaking the rule here.
[448:39.82]I saw the two and I saw... Uh-oh.
[448:46.88]But, I mean, I'm already here.
[448:49.46]So, what you're saying is... It was a 500 IQ dream.
[449:25.15]You're heading to Vegas tomorrow.
[449:26.09]I need advice.
[449:27.63]Don't spend a lot of money.
[449:29.59]Eat at Hash House.
[449:30.25]I'll go on the link.
[449:32.59]And don't stay out too late.
[449:36.32]Take it slow.
[449:40.72]But thank you Halo Softboy for that good dream interpretation.
[449:48.66]Thank you, Zion.
[449:50.42]S-A-W-S-D.
[449:51.96]Zion Sways.
[449:54.44]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[449:55.66]Jerma, why are you in the first edition Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folo from 1981?
[450:00.48]The one on the right even looks like you.
[450:03.01]How ancient... How ancient are you?
[450:07.61]Oh, this is like a... Jerm... It's like a goblin or something.
[450:23.10]This is the first edition D&D?
[450:27.14]The one on the right looks like me.
[450:31.51]And it's a Jerm lane.
[450:34.05]I... I mean, that is kind of the way my head is shaped.
[450:43.28]My ears don't look like that, though.
[450:44.42]I got better teeth than that.
[450:45.86]My nose is a little more crooked.
[450:47.68]And I got a nice full... I got a fuller jaw than that.
[450:49.92]But I do see what you're saying.
[450:54.62]But thank you for the 10 bucks.
[450:56.18]Thank you, Seven Layer Wario, for the $5.
[450:58.16]Hey, would you say happy birthday to my partner, Wes?
[451:01.40]Happy birthday, Wes.
[451:02.80]If you get this.
[451:03.78]Probably birthday is potentially day after birthday, but happy birthday yesterday.
[451:09.25]Hope you had a good one, Wes.
[451:11.89]And thank you to Seven Layer Wario for the $5.
[451:17.71]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the $2.50, Garfield.
[451:21.09]Jerma, guess whose birthday it is.
[451:22.45]It's Garfield's birthday today.
[451:23.59]The real one or yours?
[451:26.29]The comics say it's June 19th, but that's just one of Jim Davis's funny goof-ups.
[451:31.76]He got it wrong 41 years in a row somehow.
[451:34.56]Oh, that's interesting.
[451:37.10]Anyway, Jerma, as a birthday Garfagraph, can you sing a rat birthday song?
[451:41.50]Jerma, one guy, or maybe just a regular birthday song.
[451:43.90]Maybe an original.
[451:48.57]I ain't gonna sing the birthday rat song.
[451:51.50]I will say happy birthday to Garfield.
[451:55.13]What a swell guy.
[451:57.87]Happy birthday to Garfield.
[452:01.83]Whether it's cake or pie.
[452:04.19]Happy birthday to Garfield.
[452:07.16]We owe you much.
[452:12.80]Happy birthday to Garfield.
[452:15.64]Coming in in the clutch.
[452:18.19]Happy birthday.
[452:22.76]Thank you, Ryan the Giant, for the 10 bucks.
[452:28.18]Thousand bits.
[452:32.38]They said, Oswald Fattenswild from the Gallup Gazette.
[452:36.64]Can you tell us how today's stream is going to affect the rest of your season?
[452:44.70]Well, I didn't do the 100 jump.
[452:46.21]I didn't do the 100...
[452:49.46]Mario Super Jumps.
[452:50.94]So I think that's going to negatively affect me in the short term.
[452:54.38]But in the mid to long term, I think we're going to be just fine.
[453:04.94]Hey, Wiki, this thanks with three bucks.
[453:06.74]Oh boy, we're riding the royal bus.
[453:08.73]Where are we dropping?
[453:12.27]I read that.
[453:13.55]Thank you, Wolfgang, for the five dollars.
[453:16.07]Ex-vacation better be in the next Jerma Rumbler.
[453:18.09]I swear I will cause a massive riot.
[453:22.78]Probably.
[453:24.10]That's going to happen before the end of the year.
[453:29.70]There were an insane amount of subs tonight.
[453:32.68]Insane, insane, insane.
[453:35.59]There were probably at least two, three, or four hundred subs tonight with community subs involved, too.
[453:41.18]Is sub-temper actually causing a big sub-explosion here?
[453:51.29]Let's take a look at how many.
[454:01.13]Yeah.
[454:05.79]Oh, didn't the stream turn off?
[454:09.20]The stream did- the stream turned off.
[454:12.00]Remember?
[454:12.58]Like, twenty- what, an hour ago or so?
[454:15.44]Was it an hour, two hours ago?
[454:16.84]It went to like, zero.
[454:20.66]We might have lost a few.
[454:26.79]Yeah, cause this is like, just the subs from the current livestream.
[454:32.19]Did it stay on?
[454:33.87]Oh, okay.
[454:35.66]Was that five minutes ago?
[454:37.08]Was it five minutes ago?
[454:40.87]But still, it's a lot of... I mean, I can look over and see the subscriptions.
[454:45.41]This is a shitload.
[454:49.78]But... Thank you, all of you.
[454:56.48]Thank you for subscribing.
[454:57.38]I'll see you tomorrow.
[454:59.26]We're gonna do Man of Badan, the horror game.
[455:03.67]It's sort of just a one-and-done experience.
[455:07.19]We'll go.
[455:10.08]No, I want to watch my chat flourish.
[455:11.04]That's pretty good.
[455:11.76]You're coming up with these on the fly here.
[455:17.13]Also, thank you to Joel for the raid.
[455:20.43]I don't know if anybody's still here from that, but... It is very late, but... The...
[455:39.61]Thanks a lot.
[455:41.23]Thanks to everybody that was watching Joel's stream for sticking around for as long as you did.
[455:47.33]Maybe we'll see you again.
[455:51.10]Also, Phylactery Lich.
[455:55.98]50 more dollars from Phylactery Lich.
[455:59.48]Loading up a huge amount of money still.
[456:04.35]Weeks later.
[456:05.57]Phylactery is still giving insane amounts of money.
[456:10.57]Judging by how many people... Because here's the thing, this is kind of testing the waters.
[456:12.59]I said this the other day.
[456:13.21]But... I... Me...
[456:30.48]I sometimes think, oh, is that too slow?
[456:34.17]Is doing like a RPG stream too not interesting to people?
[456:39.65]Is that, you know, three streams, four streams of turn-based combat?
[456:44.29]And I kind of get in my own head and go, I don't think people are going to like that.
[456:48.84]It's boring.
[456:49.38]Is it boring?
[456:50.18]It is boring.
[456:50.70]Jeremy, is that boring?
[456:51.58]I think it is.
[456:52.06]No, it's not.
[456:52.46]I think maybe somebody would like it.
[456:54.63]So this was a test to see.
[456:56.55]And it looks like this went great.
[456:59.23]This went really, really well.
[457:05.02]So I'm just judging by how many people were happy with the game and thought that this was a good string of streams.
[457:15.31]My concern was always, is it going to get a little too draggy, a little too boring for people?
[457:18.67]But maybe it did for some.
[457:22.40]So I probably will continue to do some of these other games, but not immediately.
[457:26.51]There's a lot of things I want to do in the meantime.
[457:34.45]I'm glad that people enjoyed them.
[457:37.17]People thought they were fun.
[457:38.55]Because I love this game.
[457:42.23]Except for the 100 jumps.
[457:44.15]But I already admitted that I wasn't going to be able to do that.
[457:47.24]And I tried to time travel and do it.
[457:50.32]Still couldn't do it.
[457:51.14]You know, you have to admit when you're incapable of doing something.
[457:54.54]But that's my time.
[457:57.85]will see you guys tomorrow and right at the very end swenix gave five dollars right at the very end here thank you swenix they say hey Jeremy I just wanted to thank you because recently I lost my job as an art director I've had for some time due to the department I work for filing for bankruptcy I'm really sorry to hear that I was watching your Xbox camera green screen stream when it happened watching you in that fat suit cheered me up in a lot uh cheered me up a lot as stupid as it sounds
[458:31.59]I can't imagine having a long-term career that you've had for a while that because of a company's bankruptcy or insolvency or something, it's just kind of, that's it.
[458:45.56]I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[458:47.82]Hopefully you can find something else in the field that you can quickly turn back around.
[458:51.94]It seems like if you had that much experience, it shouldn't be that hard.
[458:56.60]Hopefully not, but seriously,
[459:02.32]Anything that can make you happy or anything that can cheer you up on these streams, that means way more to me than anything else.
[459:12.46]Good luck to you.
[459:16.86]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[459:19.89]Etalyx and I are going to play Man of Medan.
[459:22.33]Good night.
[459:23.77]Take care, everybody.
[459:26.15]See you real soon.
[459:28.17]Ta-ta.
[459:33.79]Thank you.
