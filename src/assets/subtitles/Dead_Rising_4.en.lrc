[01:29.11]Hi.
[01:31.63]I don't look like I'm late today.
[01:33.15]I look like I'm a minute or two early.
[01:39.69]What about that, huh?
[01:49.42]Let's get some last minute stuff set up.
[01:51.06]I'll be right back.
[02:10.75]Alrighty.
[02:11.87]So, as you probably saw by the title, today...
[02:37.01]Today, I don't know why that restarted, but I want to make sure it was lower.
[02:40.74]Today, we're going to do Dead Rising 4.
[02:42.14]I'm going to start it, at least, and see if I'm having any fun with it.
[02:45.68]And if I'm having any fun with it, then I'll keep playing it.
[02:47.66]If it's, you know, then I won't do it on Thursday.
[02:52.00]Important to note, I feel better tonight, sick-wise.
[02:56.03]But the one major factor that's going to put into play here to how long I can stream is how bad my fucking face hurts.
[03:05.18]I have, like, one of those sinus headaches where your eye and your teeth and your eyebrow on one side of your face all hurt.
[03:14.87]And it's like, I wanna, I wanna, like, ooh, ow!
[03:20.37]Owie, that was a little, did you guys hear that?
[03:24.09]Okay, that, that hurt.
[03:26.99]It looks like I have other problems besides that.
[03:34.13]That was like, it just broke my jaw.
[03:38.67]But, alright, we're gonna switch over to the game.
[03:40.44]You guys are gonna get to see, this is a reveal of my Xbox One user account name, by the way.
[03:47.02]I don't think this has ever been seen before.
[03:53.18]Let's go over there.
[04:03.43]Oh, God.
[04:03.95]Somebody just gave money.
[04:06.09]Oh, my God.
[04:06.58]Somebody's giving money already.
[04:08.12]It's already a money stream.
[04:11.28]Carl Monty just gave $100 and they say a Dead Rising hype.
[04:16.86]Well, thank you, Carl.
[04:17.82]$100.
[04:19.12]Yeah, I don't even think you can add me.
[04:26.50]And you know what this is?
[04:28.55]This is what we call, ladies and gentlemen, this is the default, please give me an Xbox name, because I don't give a fuck what it is.
[04:42.00]I, like, didn't give a flying fuck what my Xbox... You know why?
[04:46.18]Because there was never a world where I was ever going to use this online for any reason ever.
[04:52.17]Oh, shit.
[04:53.11]Hold on.
[04:54.55]I gotta, like, turn the... Hold on.
[04:55.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:57.41]Oh, that stream's not starting yet.
[04:59.45]Stream is not... We're not starting the stream yet.
[05:01.97]Hey, remember this?
[05:04.13]Hold on.
[05:06.57]Wait, what?
[06:33.58]How the fuck do I do this?
[06:36.68]I never use my Xbox One.
[06:42.58]I'm assuming it's under... I'm just going to put it on a child lock.
[06:50.09]Am I going to child lock myself?
[06:51.35]I think I am.
[06:54.91]I think I got it.
[06:57.79]Yeah, I think I got it.
[06:58.49]I put a child lock on my own system, I think.
[07:01.27]It might have worked.

[08:12.27]No, no.
[08:12.71]System on, but notifications off.
[08:18.31]I think I did it.
[08:19.43]I think I did it.
[08:23.17]They like to hide this shit, don't they?
[08:25.48]Microsoft.
[08:26.66]What the heck, man?
[08:29.98]Alright.
[08:31.30]Here we go.
[08:33.74]That should fix the problem.
[08:40.20]Not that it was a problem.
[08:41.76]But, you know.
[08:44.36]Uh, shit.
[08:45.10]God damn it.
[08:48.29]I need to get a capture card, too.
[08:49.55]Like, a real capture card.

[09:05.74]That is extremely generous of you.
[09:09.32]Hopefully, this is a good game.
[09:11.19]Hopefully, it's a good stream.
[09:13.41]Because somebody already paid $100 for it.

[14:52.50]It's like a different gun.
[14:55.00]Shoots like balls of lightning.

[25:52.77]Oh my god.
[25:59.79]Get some pictures.
[26:00.39]Okay.
[26:00.57]You got it.
[26:01.09]I got some pictures of you.
[26:01.93]Do you think I have done this before?
[26:07.23]You know, she turned like in the perfect place.
[26:10.78]Oh, you just shot that guy.
[26:11.64]Did I get it?
[26:16.22]I'm crouching.
[26:18.00]What the hell?
[26:18.92]Nice.
[26:22.42]What's going on here?
[26:23.78]Let's go find out what else we got.
[26:33.50]Damn it, I wanted to get a good shot of her face.
[26:35.12]Alright, explore the base.
[26:36.56]Let's go.
[26:36.76]Yeah, I'm just creating evidence.
[26:40.44]That's really all I'm doing, you're right.
[26:46.32]Can I jump over this?
[26:48.06]I'd say I could vault over things.
[26:50.22]Apparently not that thing.
[26:53.83]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[26:56.51]Somebody's gotta fix that!
[27:00.41]Fucking F.
[27:09.38]Oh, we got another cutscene.
[27:12.13]That was so anticlimactic because it went to a black screen first.
[27:15.91]We could have done a little better than that, Capcom.
[27:24.51]F, what?
[27:29.67]Tch.
[27:37.30]Alright, just fucking beat it up like you're supposed to.
[27:44.05]Can I, like, stomp it?
[27:46.13]Ah, yeah, we've got another violation over here, guys.
[27:49.53]Sorry, I'm gonna have to take a picture of this.
[27:53.03]Do I have- Okay, am I gonna run out of space?
[27:55.93]I really hope so.
[27:57.33]Hope so.
[27:57.71]No, I hope not.
[28:06.03]Since when is it dead?
[28:07.69]Oh, we got a wrench.
[28:09.44]Wanna take a picture of this?
[28:13.52]Wait, coffee!
[28:14.84]Coffee!
[28:15.22]Alright, this is gonna open.
[28:20.53]Water inventory's full.
[28:24.05]Apparently I can't carry more than a few things.
[28:29.27]Whoa!
[28:29.49]I thought you were gonna open up the door in front of me.
[28:32.72]What the hell?
[28:33.14]I don't know which door you're gonna open up first, please.
[28:37.79]I'm so glad I can actually hear this shit.
[28:39.29]12 hit combo, sick!
[28:52.64]Alright, I gotta get a picture.
[28:55.90]Got it!
[28:57.48]A+.
[28:59.46]Thanks for the D. Oh, that's a good kick, I can utilize that kick very often.
[29:13.30]I like that, that's a cool move.
[29:20.32]Keep the hit counter going, you get to do skill moves, okay.
[29:26.35]This is a... what is it?
[29:27.69]Electric prod.
[29:38.75]Bring up your melee, your weapons inventory by holding right for ranged weapons, up for melee weapons, and left for thrown weapons.
[29:44.65]Quick swap weapons by tapping.
[29:45.93]Mm-hmm.
[29:48.95]Okay.
[29:49.25]So you can hold up on the... Yeah, alright.
[29:55.41]If you don't have any ranged weapons, don't have any thrown weapons, eat to restore health.
[30:03.08]Alright.
[30:03.54]How do you go down?
[30:06.25]Got it.
[30:08.81]Crank it.
[30:13.06]Just get right in the middle of him.
[30:19.90]Come on, I got too high.
[30:20.76]I gotta do my visceral attack.
[30:21.78]Alright, that was nice.
[30:23.77]Something tells me this is M.A.S.H.
[30:28.73]X the video game.
[30:36.15]Kind of is, but you know, it's fun to slay zombies.
[30:39.03]Just like old times.
[30:41.33]Hang on.
[30:42.83]I'm coming down.
[30:43.71]His payment, 10 bucks from Obey the Kitten.
[30:46.58]Here's payment for my first month's subscription to Dorkube.
[30:49.88]Well, thanks, dude.
[30:51.34]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[30:53.10]Mick, I forgive you.
[30:54.92]This is way better than mini-golf.
[30:58.33]So mini-golf is like the joke here, huh?
[30:59.73]Alright, I can take a picture of that.
[31:00.61]That's like not evil scientist shit.
[31:03.48]Come on, there's like a torture device right there.
[31:20.89]Thank you, Rainbow Dash, Obey the Kitten, Dark Star, Great Head for the 1335 bits.
[31:26.34]Merry early crimbus, Jermaine.
[31:27.66]Put these accumulated ad bits towards buying a new wheelbarrow.
[31:32.12]I have plenty of wheelbarrows.
[31:33.22]I don't need any more than this.
[31:34.36]Let's go.
[31:39.16]Keep going.
[31:41.22]Midget Gummy Bear, thank you for the four months.
[31:42.79]Or three months.
[31:44.83]Aubrey Smith, thank you for six months.

[31:54.43]Lilypads for three months.
[31:56.83]Thanks, you guys.
[31:58.91]Take a photo of the device.
[31:59.79]I already did.
[32:14.32]Shit, I wanted to get, like, her in every picture.
[32:18.50]But, you know, we're not gonna do that joke anymore.
[32:22.09]Better angle.
[32:22.69]What the fuck are you talking about?
[32:36.92]Okay.
[32:38.64]Alright.
[32:39.87]I thought I just had- I didn't know I had a beetle.
[32:41.81]Hold on, wait.
[32:42.49]Oh boy, that's so stupid.
[32:50.17]I'm gonna utilize this to its fullest extent, hopefully.
[32:56.52]God, what, like, dead eyes he has.
[32:58.20]Alright, let's go.
[33:03.02]Take a photo of the clamp.
[33:03.96]Ah, I gotta take... Alright, can I get a selfie of this one?
[33:05.91]I hope so.
[33:06.37]Come on, turn it around.
[33:16.58]I love that you can do that.
[33:21.88]And that actually counted for me.
[33:23.89]That's so stupid.
[33:25.77]Let's put the wrench back on this thing.
[33:27.09]It's about to die.
[33:36.39]Watch out.
[33:36.97]I gotta get a picture of this.
[33:41.64]Zombrex, this stuff suppresses zombie-ism if you get bit.
[33:45.25]Yeah, but everyone's immune to the parasite now.
[33:48.03]Shit.
[33:49.11]Where do they even get these zombies?
[33:51.73]Look, we don't need all the answers.
[33:53.19]Just enough to sell the story.
[33:54.85]Come on, let's keep moving.
[33:55.87]No friendly fire?
[33:56.47]How not realistic.
[33:57.18]Yeah.
[34:00.82]Hey, thanks a lot, Bill Clinton.
[34:04.54]For yourself.
[34:10.36]headache pills.
[34:10.96]I actually need those in real life.
[34:12.72]Yeah, it's really neat.
[34:18.84]Look for evidence.
[34:40.01]Alright, gotta find evidence.
[34:43.14]Oh, wait a minute.
[34:44.26]There's somebody's watches over here.
[34:46.08]There's somebody's watch.
[34:48.30]Oh no, that's the keyboard.
[34:49.90]It must be the watch.
[34:53.46]Okay.
[34:54.34]Cutscene!
[34:54.92]Here we go!
[34:59.64]Physically, she's symptom-free.
[35:01.24]Now, that's a big improvement.
[35:03.78]Otherwise, no change.
[35:05.38]Why am I looking at this?
[35:08.01]It looks like my friend's mother.
[35:08.81]Hi, Def.
[35:34.92]Alright, let's go game.
[35:36.88]I didn't buy this game to do a fucking murder mystery.
[35:44.43]I bought this game to kill zombies.
[36:10.62]Ugh, gross, Frank.
[36:11.80]He's got no underwear on?
[36:12.52]Whoa!
[36:12.66]What?
[36:14.00]Analyzing?
[36:15.86]How does me taking... What the fuck?
[36:18.85]Okay, I take a picture of the door and I can open it now.
[36:40.48]Alright.
[36:46.95]Alright.
[36:55.04]Thank you, UltraViolent and CP159.
[36:56.48]Thanks for the sub.
[36:57.38]I thought that was supposed to be in the past.
[37:07.28]Nah, I gotta do it in a karate move.
[37:08.43]That should be worth at least like 40 points.
[37:09.73]Let's fucking go.
[37:12.37]Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[37:13.43]Did that just say interrogate the zombie?
[37:16.23]Yeah, so what happened?
[37:39.59]Oh, actually I have to come over here and get you.
[37:43.65]I gotta lure the zombie and then incinerate.
[37:47.88]Go on, go over there.
[37:50.28]Go get the giant turkey leg.
[37:54.36]And goodbye.
[37:54.90]Okay, that's like so morbid.
[38:07.90]E?
[38:08.58]What does E mean?
[38:09.56]Wait, what?
[38:11.99]Did I get her?
[38:12.43]Do I have to do it again?
[38:13.69]Who wants barbecue?
[38:15.79]No?
[38:16.71]No one?
[38:17.49]Holy shit, Frank.
[38:18.97]This is some atrocity level shit going on here and the best you can do is crack wise?
[38:23.53]That is unfair.
[38:24.61]I have photographed things and thought about things.
[38:26.90]I can't do it again.
[38:27.52]You don't actually care what's happening to these people, do you?
[38:30.32]Look, let's just get what we can for and get out of here.
[38:33.78]Okay?
[38:34.16]Okay?
[38:35.00]Okay?
[38:36.00]She's gonna jump up and grab me in the leg or something.
[38:37.86]Watch this.
[38:38.54]Mmm!
[38:39.36]Great fry!
[38:40.54]Well, never mind.
[38:41.53]That was gonna be like a... Gah!
[38:42.65]She's got me!
[38:43.89]Nope.
[38:50.47]God.
[38:50.71]Uh-oh.
[38:52.29]Look at all this.
[38:53.63]I need pictures.
[38:54.89]Of everything.
[38:56.52]Oh, okay.
[38:59.84]It just wants me to take that.
[39:00.96]Got it.
[39:01.98]Their faces are all the same.
[39:04.18]Any others?
[39:04.74]Oh, boxes, no?
[39:05.72]Take a picture of the fridge?
[39:08.22]Take a picture of the... Alien thing?
[39:11.42]Oh, there's a guy in there.
[39:15.22]Uh-oh.
[39:19.46]Is this Resident Evil?
[39:22.58]Or is this Dead Rising?
[39:26.61]Just open up the fridge and take the fucking free money.
[39:31.97]Oh, barbecue ribs?
[39:32.81]Just eat them.
[39:35.67]I can only hold two health potions at the moment.
[39:39.50]Anything else in the fridge?
[39:40.34]Oh, freezer there is.
[39:43.62]I can't really take it, so who cares?
[39:48.10]Is this Morse code?
[39:49.10]I don't like... I don't care.
[39:49.86]Yeah.
[39:49.96]DNA test results.
[40:05.15]They're cloning people, manufacturing fodder for zombie research, experimenting on them, imprisoning them.
[40:11.92]Vic, this story's gonna win us every award on the planet, so please, please, just stay focused long enough for us to get out of here.
[40:19.52]Is this even the same?
[40:20.16]This doesn't even look like Frank West.
[40:21.92]I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.
[40:23.31]This is supposed to be Frank West?
[40:26.65]That's someone crying.
[40:27.75]Vic, we have what we need.
[40:29.91]Let's go, now!
[40:32.17]Vic, stop!
[40:34.31]What are you doing?
[40:34.81]You're going off on your own, don't you know?
[40:35.91]In every horror movie that's a bad idea, you're gonna get yourself killed.
[40:45.86]Well, that's creepy.
[40:49.92]What a shot.
[40:53.32]Oh, yeah.
[40:54.36]That's really good.
[40:56.30]Alright, what a weirdo.
[40:58.40]What the hell are you doing?
[41:06.35]What happened to get the story and get out?
[41:12.45]Stay calm, Vic.
[41:13.45]That's what I said.
[41:14.07]Stay fucking calm.
[41:15.09]Now you put us both in danger.
[41:17.23]I'm a reporter!
[41:17.85]Oh shit, a human!
[41:19.93]Run!
[41:20.43]Oh no, military!
[41:48.22]Wait, since when?
[41:53.76]Oh.
[41:55.60]Blueprints.
[41:57.42]Yeah, they unlock the ability to create combo weapons.
[41:59.59]Once a blueprint is acquired, the required components will glow blue.
[42:03.69]Making them easier to find.
[42:04.99]Okay.
[42:06.79]Okay.
[42:07.29]Create a combo weapon.
[42:09.43]Okay.
[42:18.47]Use R to select a combo ingredient.
[42:21.83]Okay, that looks like a combo ingredient.
[42:26.03]Use R to choose ingredients, then plus A to combo.
[42:31.01]That plus that equals that.
[42:32.15]Now I've got a super grenade weapon.
[42:39.53]Alright, let's go open the door and let's go kick some ass.
[42:53.08]That's what I'm talking about.
[42:57.23]Send that guy to the moon!
[43:07.45]I feel like... I feel like this is just too... They went to like 100 in the first fucking 20 minutes of the game.
[43:18.76]What if I happen to like throw plates at people?
[43:25.91]I kinda miss not being very good.
[43:28.13]Remember when you used to pick up kitchen knives and stuff and that was the only thing you could do?
[43:42.14]The first weapon you get in the game is a grenade sledgehammer.
[43:56.68]They're almost all dead.
[43:59.70]Any more?
[44:00.06]Oh, a couple more.
[44:06.57]I did it.
[44:06.97]I killed 200 zombies, man.
[44:11.67]Zombie apocalypse.
[44:13.95]Is there anything else I can do here?
[44:17.95]There's still a zombie left.
[44:21.62]Where?
[44:23.94]Oh, there's one guy over here.
[44:27.99]Sorry, he's dead.
[44:28.67]I win.

[44:53.88]Okay, yeah, let's just put a point into something.
[44:58.02]Melee weapons.
[45:00.80]No, just combo guide shit.
[45:02.46]Alright.
[45:03.38]How do I... I have one skill point.
[45:08.89]Unlocks critical hits with all melee attacks.
[45:10.89]Okay, well, what about fortitude?
[45:14.95]Unlocks slow health regeneration.
[45:19.43]Anything over 30 is middle-aged.
[45:20.99]What?
[45:22.13]That's not true.
[45:25.22]You're talking like 40, 45 is middle-aged.
[45:32.02]I ain't middle-aged yet.

[50:06.95]How well you work with others.
[50:08.79]Oh, well, shit, that's never been my strong suit.
[50:21.55]Kind of stuffy in here, don't you think?
[50:22.85]A little fresh air.
[50:31.16]I really thought that would work.
[50:35.06]Alright.
[50:35.46]Well, it seems I have some time on my hands.
[50:36.90]What do you want to talk about?
[50:39.21]I know who you are.
[50:40.83]Colonel Brad Park, commander of the ZDC.

[50:52.83]soil.

[51:05.08]How long has this been going on?
[51:06.58]Going on six weeks now.
[51:08.44]Really?
[51:10.06]It's a long time to silence an entire town.
[51:12.96]Not for them.
[51:15.06]Who?
[51:15.96]The Pentagon.
[51:18.14]Oh, shit.
[51:23.93]What did you see there?
[51:27.49]You know what I saw.
[51:28.15]I just, like, ruined the cutscene.
[51:29.27]Nobody knows, Frank.
[51:31.89]The only reason I found out is because somebody screwed up and passed me a top-level report.
[51:39.22]This reservist training center, I have yet to see anyone who's actually stationed there.
[51:46.91]All communications in and out of the town are gone.
[51:50.01]Hell, the satellite photos have been updated in four months.
[51:52.51]He's kind of stressed out.
[51:53.51]Maybe he should call it relaxation hotline.
[51:58.83]But all that pales in comparison to the mystery of why you, Frank West, are teaching a goddamn night class instead of being two steps ahead of me on this.
[52:10.72]anybody care about any of this by the way just out of curiosity does anyone in this all the 1900 people that are here I quit does anyone care about a goddamn thing either one of these two people is saying right now do you know how many outbreaks I've been part of how many I've covered and what thanks have I got huh nothing no thank yous no flowers just a contact book filled with dead people national headliner award 2006
[52:38.10]You exposed the first zombie outbreak on U.S., so I photographed the whole thing.
[52:41.72]You got some medals, a few letters behind your name.
[52:44.02]Honorary, of course.
[52:44.76]Yeah, but let's get to the point.
[52:47.50]Three weeks later, I tried to expose the Pentagon and the entire U.S.
[52:50.90]government for their involvement with it, and they bury me!
[52:56.35]Because you didn't have sufficient evidence.
[53:01.16]You come with me to Wilmette.
[53:03.46]We expose this bullshit.
[53:05.34]And you do it right this time.
[53:07.36]Frank.
[53:07.96]It's drop all to skip it.
[53:09.20]By the time I do that, it'll be over.
[53:10.66]I just want to throw a plate at a zombie.
[53:17.02]No.
[53:18.58]And then I can end the stream.
[53:20.10]I'm going to throw a plate at a zombie.
[53:21.46]The stream's ending.
[53:24.92]They're in for some big gains.
[53:28.79]Maybe even win back something.
[53:32.19]But actually, I'm surprised that you let an amateur rip this up from under you.
[53:39.84]What the hell are you talking about?
[53:43.16]This is one of your students, isn't it?
[53:45.56]What the fuck?
[53:46.54]Did you show me like a nude picture?
[53:50.12]I think you... Whoops.
[53:52.34]Oh, wait, that's a picture of him?
[53:57.41]Vic.
[53:59.24]That was like so stupid.
[54:01.14]That just like interrupted a very dramatic scene.
[54:03.40]Why?
[54:03.74]Why the fuck?
[54:08.44]Can I kill a zombie yet?
[54:14.99]Hell of a team you've assembled.
[54:19.41]Coming up on Willamette.
[54:27.73]Nobody looks like... Nobody does that, by the way.
[54:29.59]That's something I've realized.
[54:30.39]I want to get this off my chest.
[54:32.49]Anytime somebody's looking at something in the distance, and... No, okay, hold on.
[54:35.27]They can shoot us down with a rocket launcher first.
[54:36.79]That's important to note.
[54:38.51]Nobody holds their hand up like that.
[54:41.88]Have you ever seen somebody hold their hand up and, like, put it up, like, fucking to their brow to see something far away?
[54:46.64]No, no one ever does that.
[54:48.16]Why?
[54:53.82]Wait, what?
[54:59.53]Alright.
[55:01.79]Let's do it.
[55:02.97]Dead Rising 4.
[55:04.13]Been waiting a long time for this game.
[55:08.83]If it's sunny... It wasn't sunny.
[55:10.13]That was overcast.
[55:14.46]Thank you, Dr. Ganglina, for the 10 months.
[55:16.80]I missed the baby.
[55:17.66]It was a cutscene.
[55:19.74]I just didn't want to talk over it.
[55:21.02]I'm still in a cutscene, but it's okay.
[55:25.96]Make you lactose cow for 8 months and dragon breath for 10 months.
[55:28.98]Thanks a lot guys.
[55:37.97]Yeah, why do you keep saying wakey wakey?
[55:42.27]That just was so... out of place.
[55:43.37]Alright, let's go.
[55:45.63]Me and you.
[55:45.93]Defend Brad.
[55:46.25]The bass guitar!
[55:59.46]No, no, I'm supposed to be gun guy.
[56:00.58]I'm supposed to be gun guy.
[56:07.67]Where is he?
[56:10.09]Is he just in there somewhere?
[56:11.23]I don't even know where he is.
[56:16.19]Where is he?
[56:16.65]Oh, he's right there.
[56:22.35]I couldn't even see him.
[56:23.25]Bully knife.
[56:31.62]Stop crawlers.
[56:32.32]Okay, I got it.
[56:37.87]Ooh.
[56:40.47]Hey, Frank!
[56:45.19]Is it too loud?
[56:45.91]How is it?
[56:46.63]Get him off me.
[56:51.79]Give me the chair!
[56:57.33]How do I... Can't you throw shit?
[57:01.14]How do I throw things?
[57:03.56]Oh boy, Capcom, if you removed the ability for me to throw objects, you're getting an angry letter.
[57:12.41]It's good?
[57:13.27]Okay.
[57:18.07]It's loud.
[57:18.61]Hey, I'll do this.
[57:27.38]That's probably better.
[57:28.94]Now that we actually can... Eh, I'm going to turn this down too.
[57:35.97]They removed it?
[57:37.65]Shut up.
[57:39.41]Shut up.
[57:39.79]No, honestly, shut up.
[57:41.43]You can't be... No way.
[57:44.41]It's like I can unlock it.
[57:45.37]Hold on.
[57:46.15]I'm about to stop playing the game.
[57:49.63]That's a deal breaker for me.
[57:55.58]Okay, improve critical hits.
[57:58.70]Improve jump attack.
[58:00.09]Where's throw?
[58:00.73]Where's throw?
[58:06.65]Grapple, double strike, skill move, melee fury.
[58:15.75]Major vehicle.
[58:16.53]Okay, well, you can drive cars, so hold on.
[58:18.53]I gotta stay in the game now.
[58:22.06]Yeah, we're gonna stay in the game.
[58:23.50]You can drive cars.
[58:24.22]That means I have to stay in the game.
[58:25.20]Sorry, guys.
[58:26.48]Uh, but yeah, that's, um... You can't throw melee.
[58:31.66]What the fuck were you thinking?
[58:33.47]What?
[58:33.67]That's, like, one of the most fun things you could do in the other games.
[58:35.93]Unless that you guys are wrong.
[58:37.83]Alright.
[58:40.17]We need cover.
[58:40.77]That hotel looks good.
[58:44.71]Eh, three stars are best.
[58:46.23]You ever stop clowning.
[58:47.83]I should take a good look around.
[58:48.63]Holy shit, that's ridiculous.
[58:49.67]Fine, just meet me at the hotel.
[58:52.42]Alright, meet Brad at the hotel.
[58:53.36]Where's the, um... Don't you usually have, like, a timer in these games?
[58:59.12]Don't you have, like, three days or something in-game to beat them?
[59:04.82]Have we not gotten to that point yet?
[59:08.10]Meet Brad at the hotel.
[59:09.04]Okay.
[59:09.32]There's an encounter.
[59:11.81]Encounter!
[59:18.59]Can't just kill people, too?
[59:27.73]They removed the timer.
[59:29.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[59:31.79]Hold on.
[59:33.37]What is Dead Rising?
[59:35.43]What is this game?
[59:38.11]You can't fucking throw shit and there's no timer?
[59:42.97]Come on.
[59:44.74]Let's see what she has to say.
[59:49.78]I'm gonna die.
[59:56.72]Alright, you wanna get down or you?
[59:58.10]No, I gotta kill all these people.
[60:00.12]Why do these people have skulls but the ones next to them don't?
[60:15.78]Oh fuck, I like, I'm actually gonna die.
[60:19.48]I'm like actually gonna die here.
[60:26.31]Like, when does she think I've killed the zombies to free the survivor?
[60:29.77]Alright, well, what the fuck is going on here, lady?
[60:33.46]Why don't you just jump down?
[60:36.66]I hope she just gets eaten.
[60:40.84]I, like, need... Alright, well, I'm gonna have to come back because I don't have any health.
[60:47.97]I can't climb back up, though.
[60:49.03]Okay, yeah, I can.
[60:51.23]Sorry, lady.
[60:54.71]Well, I tried, but the game just kept loading more zombies for me to attack.
[60:59.01]What do I even have?
[61:00.85]Do I need to kill every zombie in the building?
[61:10.29]Oh shit!
[61:13.24]No, I wanted to do this!
[61:16.80]You know how to kill every zombie in the fucking building.
[61:24.74]Can I get this grayscale off me?
[61:26.20]Um, what happens if you die?
[61:31.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:32.19]Hold on.
[61:32.41]There's, like, molotovs here.
[61:35.89]Can I throw these?
[61:39.27]How do I throw these?
[61:47.03]That's not how you throw.
[61:54.00]It's like down or something, isn't it?
[61:56.02]No, I just drank like a shitload of booze.
[62:00.18]How do you actually throw?
[62:01.00]Hold on.
[62:04.18]Let me just figure out how to throw.
[62:06.28]It's left on the D-pad to get it, but how do you actually throw shit?
[62:11.97]Wait a minute.
[62:12.31]Hold on.
[62:16.59]Controls.
[62:18.94]You can't throw molotovs?
[62:20.50]No, you can't.
[62:24.82]You can't even... What?
[62:28.22]Shut up.
[62:28.88]No, I don't believe that for a second.
[62:34.85]No, I don't believe that.
[62:36.65]There's no fucking way.
[62:38.51]I'm just not doing it right.
[62:39.59]Somebody!
[62:43.77]Anybody!
[62:52.59]No, I'm just not doing it right.
[62:59.09]I'm just not doing it right.
[63:02.09]I gotta go to the fucking... How to throw.
[63:11.06]Hit right trigger.
[63:11.70]That's what I'm doing.
[63:16.52]You have to punch with it?
[63:18.91]No, you don't.
[63:20.06]Yeah, right trigger's not doing anything.
[63:21.32]Left trigger... Okay, alright.
[63:23.00]It's left bumper.
[63:23.96]It's left bumper.
[63:25.40]Got it.
[63:28.70]God damn.
[63:31.54]Alright, will you talk to me?
[63:39.56]Eat shit!
[63:39.76]Alright, I'm gonna try left bumper with the, uh... The other thing.
[63:48.63]Game saved.
[63:49.79]Yep, game saved.
[63:50.91]Alright, I gotta kill this one more person.
[63:53.48]Nope, I gotta kill all of you.
[64:17.15]You get down?
[64:17.77]You just keep saying nice.
[64:20.63]How many more zombies do I have to kill before you get down?
[64:24.09]What?
[64:26.96]Oh my fucking god, this is so stupid.
[64:29.10]I have to go kill those ones and it aggro's more over here.
[64:33.08]That I have to now kill again.
[64:38.54]Give me the chair.
[64:39.06]I'm throwing the chair.
[64:39.84]No, can't.
[64:53.32]No, why?
[64:55.60]Why?
[64:58.94]This is never gonna fucking end.
[65:00.96]Oh my god, it finally ended.
[65:03.58]Where are you going?
[65:04.24]Please come over here.
[65:09.40]Good thing she's just in the way.
[65:10.39]That's it.
[65:12.19]Okay.
[65:13.25]I got like some pee-pee.
[65:14.07]I can't throw this?
[65:25.98]Alright, well, um... Kind of want to do some survivability here.
[65:30.95]Okay.
[65:33.47]No, I want to be shoot guy.
[65:34.03]Damage with pistols?
[65:34.65]Sure.
[65:34.81]Sure.
[65:53.58]Do I actively avoid mayonnaise?
[65:55.64]No.
[65:57.26]Mayonnaise is good in certain situations.
[65:58.78]What is going on?
[66:07.13]Get out.
[66:11.21]I really wish I could throw things.
[66:13.71]Alright, let's go meet this guy at the fucking banquet.
[66:15.99]Whatever the hell we need to do.
[66:20.37]It's only 100 meters this way.
[66:27.44]Climb.
[66:34.30]Okay, go ahead.
[66:35.78]Go ahead and climb it, sir.
[66:41.71]You guys hear me going like... I really want to get this awful gray tone off the screen right now.
[66:59.88]Wait, does that mean if you can't throw plates, the stream will never end?
[67:03.49]Oh, shit.
[67:05.21]That's right.
[67:07.55]What do I do?
[67:08.03]I'm really surprised they took that out.
[67:11.28]I wish.
[67:20.74]Roofed climbing.
[67:22.52]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Lano589 for the six months.

[67:55.07]Blueprint for crossbow, blam, so what the hell?
[67:59.69]Okay, drink a lodge soda.
[68:00.85]At least I can fill up completely here.
[68:08.10]Propane tank.
[68:13.98]Okay, now it's telling me how to throw things.
[68:15.81]I was gonna say, I never got the tutorial.

[68:40.67]Sledgehammer.
[68:41.39]Alright, can I make something here?
[68:49.79]Yeah, I can make this thing again.
[68:55.51]What else can I do?
[68:57.83]Alright.
[68:58.39]You have guns over here.
[68:59.55]I saw.
[68:59.93]Oh, shit.
[69:07.50]I could do the propane tank thing with that, couldn't I?
[69:10.04]Oh, fuck it.
[69:10.58]Whatever.
[69:10.84]I think I still can, actually.
[69:22.05]Alright, let's make the 4th of July gun.
[69:31.14]Microtransactions for each one thrown.
[69:33.42]Yeah, I'm still sick.
[69:35.25]Not as bad as I was a couple days ago, but...
[69:38.14]Like I said previously, all I really have now is a lot of congestion.
[69:42.08]And my fucking face just is killing me.
[69:44.52]Especially the left side of my sinuses are all fucked up.
[69:47.80]But, I think I took everything I could take.

[73:27.81]And now I need to find out why.
[73:28.83]And I'm not going to be able to do that with some flatfoot holding my leash.
[73:32.36]No offense.
[73:33.48]Alright.
[73:34.30]I'll head into town.
[73:35.30]We'll get to relief efforts.

[73:37.44]God damn it.
[73:38.08]You clued me in.
[73:39.34]Yeah, if I get time.
[73:41.42]Alright, I'm out of here.
[73:42.48]There's a militia forming out in West Ridge.
[73:44.75]I definitely don't want that thing.
[73:45.97]Later, bros.
[73:46.53]It's a funny cannon.
[73:48.49]Good luck to you, West.
[73:50.55]Plunder.

[74:24.63]Electric wreath.
[74:25.79]I don't want that.
[74:29.78]That's the dev room.
[74:32.22]Thank you, Shadowbolts, for the 500 bits, dude.
[74:35.64]And Mukimari, thank you.
[74:38.92]Hey, Handshoes, thanks for the eight months.
[74:40.36]Lano589, thanks for the six months.
[74:42.76]Ahon, thanks for two months.
[74:44.16]Thanks.
[74:44.96]Welcome.
[74:46.88]Uh, I think I leveled up, didn't I?
[74:48.78]Yeah.
[74:50.28]Alright, I kind of need to fortitude.
[74:52.88]Let's just do that.
[74:53.80]Yeah.
[74:56.21]Health regen.
[75:05.22]Whatever we say.
[75:06.42]Who cares?
[75:12.24]Why am I not playing with somebody else?
[75:13.19]Because there's no campaign co-op in this game.
[75:20.01]Whoa!
[75:20.43]Somebody's right next to me.
[75:21.11]Can I actually get in the go-kart?
[75:25.09]Are you shitting me?
[75:28.70]I did say this was redeemed because you can drive cars.
[75:35.66]I'd love to get in that car.
[75:36.72]That'd be really, really great.
[75:38.14]Let's see what the execution is.
[75:46.19]Yeah, let's go.
[75:48.37]Press R to accelerate?
[76:00.63]Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!
[76:03.93]These car controls do not feel like they should be car controls.
[76:08.13]I mean, we're gonna beat this.
[76:14.82]Right?
[76:19.38]I hope so.
[76:19.88]I think I just can't hit it that many.
[76:22.01]Just avoid them and I'll do it.
[76:29.71]Alright, that was fucking stupid.
[76:30.97]Um, obviously taking this thing.
[76:54.88]Why would I not take this stupid little shopping cart?
[76:57.87]Oh, I got back on the track.
[76:59.21]Hold on.
[77:02.51]Alright, let's keep going.
[77:09.77]Find the mall security center.
[77:17.36]Catch up with Vic.
[77:21.49]Blueprint?
[77:23.33]Was there a blueprint in there?
[77:24.95]I kind of just didn't even give a shit.
[77:26.27]I just saw this and I grabbed it.
[77:33.67]It's like blending in with the ground.
[77:36.49]I thought something was supposed to glow.
[77:39.59]Alright, well let's make the kilowatt.
[77:49.88]Alright.
[77:52.29]So what the hell does this thing even do?
[77:54.87]Press to launch the vehicle's weapon?
[77:56.99]Kind of don't want to use it yet.
[78:01.21]Does anybody else feel like I'm so tiny in this thing?
[78:08.26]Alright, let's try it.
[78:11.80]Shoot like little laser balls on springs.
[78:16.40]Here it is!
[78:16.80]What's your problem?
[78:18.04]Holy shit!
[78:21.93]Wasn't there a really big fat lady that was in Dead Rising 2 that rode around one of these things?
[78:31.57]What the hell are they?
[78:33.73]What are these guys?
[78:39.27]It's just like random survivor people?
[78:44.70]Can I like help these guys?
[78:50.98]I'm going to assume these are probably bad.
[78:52.23]Yeah, they're bad guys.
[78:53.05]Of course they are.
[78:54.29]Why wouldn't they be?
[78:55.37]Hostile survivors.
[78:57.65]Okay.
[78:59.49]There are other players.
[79:02.75]Oh, I missed.
[79:22.68]What do the snow globes do?
[79:23.86]I have no clue.
[79:26.94]Yeah, the zombie computer salesman.
[79:31.42]I remember Dead Rising 3 was a lot of fun.
[79:34.63]It was like stupid, but it was stupid fun.
[79:36.37]Come on, get down.
[79:48.11]Still alive?
[79:53.38]I'm just gonna eat the snack so I can full health.
[79:55.44]Why not?
[80:00.50]Scissors.
[80:00.92]What is that?
[80:01.46]Holiday cracker?
[80:02.48]Is this like wrapping paper?
[80:08.62]I don't want that.
[80:16.05]Is that the servo head?
[80:17.29]No.
[80:24.11]Doesn't look that bad.
[80:25.87]No, I'm sure it's fun.
[80:29.51]Somebody's in here.
[80:32.33]Can I get in here, or are you just stuck in the fucking wall?
[80:35.14]You're hitting me through the wall.
[80:36.30]Alright, can I kill you?
[80:37.04]Can I hit you through the wall?
[80:42.94]Get out of here, swamp thing.
[80:44.44]Alright, wait.
[80:48.10]Come on.
[80:50.87]Do what you just did, so I can get a good picture of it.
[80:56.07]Oh, fuck you.
[80:56.67]Fine.
[80:59.33]Where is Molotov?
[81:04.03]Can I only hold three of these?
[81:04.93]I think I can only hold three.
[81:05.94]There's a Magnum here, too.
[81:10.88]What other ranged shit do I have?
[81:13.38]T-shirt launcher.
[81:14.30]Let's just see what it does.
[81:18.69]This is kind of dumb.
[81:20.33]Give me the shotgun instead.
[81:28.54]Cash register.
[81:29.30]See, you can like throw these things.
[81:31.66]No, okay.
[81:32.82]Alright.
[81:35.12]Oh well.
[81:37.43]That's a major, major issue with this game if that's the case.
[81:43.03]It was fun just to do whatever you wanted.
[81:44.73]Fun just to whip shit around.
[81:47.76]I want to put on new clothes.
[81:49.80]Maybe the tuxedo.
[81:53.35]Yeah, I'm going to be playing Resident Evil 7 in VR.
[81:56.35]It's going to be my first ever VR experience.
[81:59.99]That should be fun.
[82:01.25]Spear.
[82:04.35]Okay, this is probably really good.
[82:10.34]It shoots t-shirts.
[82:11.30]Yeah, but it shoots t-shirts.
[82:12.20]It's not going to hurt anybody.
[82:15.30]Business casual?
[82:16.74]No.
[82:17.76]Stay with the tuxedo.
[82:18.60]Let's just go to the mall center.
[82:30.22]That's a lot of people.
[82:32.20]That's a lot of enemies.
[82:33.89]Let's... Might as well, right?
[82:36.41]Throw the snow globe, too.
[82:47.08]Alright, now that I attracted everybody's attention... Okay, well, let's just go.
[82:55.18]Forget it.
[82:57.83]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[82:58.37]What's that?
[83:02.48]That's not what I wanted.
[83:04.44]Okay, I got a cruise tanning safe key.
[83:12.38]I'm not sure what that means.
[83:14.58]It's like a... key for a store?
[83:24.63]Whoa!
[83:25.69]Why did I pick up the Santa?
[83:27.89]What?
[83:28.11]Okay, I don't want the Santa Claus.
[83:34.02]There's a blue marker over here.
[83:35.86]Doesn't it usually mean that there's an event or something?
[83:41.40]Somebody in here?
[83:50.94]Don't mind me, I'm just gonna be tanning in here.
[83:52.82]Wait, what?
[83:58.19]Are you serious?
[84:01.74]Get out of here!
[84:02.30]I have 45 scheduled minutes in this thing!
[84:06.02]Get the fuck out of here!
[84:09.60]That is so stupid.
[84:20.01]Oh shit, I abandoned the car!
[84:21.45]Oh fuck!
[84:24.03]Oh my god, there's so many!
[84:25.81]There's so many!
[84:27.49]There's so many!
[84:30.88]I am fucked in here, by the way.
[84:34.28]How am I gonna get out?
[84:38.72]Alright, I gotta fucking think of a strategy here.
[84:45.36]Foolproof strategy, here we go.
[84:48.62]Go!
[84:51.30]Use the basketball for distraction!
[84:52.40]And then drop a couple grenades!
[85:04.52]Am I beating him with the grenade?
[85:05.74]Alright, eat some dinner.
[85:12.64]I left my go-kart.
[85:17.39]It's too late.
[85:18.15]There'll be another one, don't worry.
[85:24.43]There's something else in there I can probably do, but it's too dangerous at the moment.
[85:27.22]Fuck it, let's just go.
[85:28.94]See, look, there's another one.
[85:29.92]I'm fine.
[85:31.24]I'll just get in this one.
[85:44.48]Here comes a cutscene, I'm gonna assume.
[85:51.22]Woo!
[85:56.83]Pickin' me the hammer instead.
[86:06.74]Clear out the shelter.
[86:07.64]Ah, here's the shelter.
[86:08.61]Okay.
[86:11.77]Nice tan.
[86:12.39]Yeah, it is pretty nice.
[86:13.29]Too bad it's getting covered up with a goofy superhero costume.
[86:17.27]The second I'm able to do that.
[86:21.93]Let's just clear it out.
[86:25.21]How many food?
[86:25.63]I have one food.
[86:26.33]Floor.
[86:26.71]Let's just go.
[86:30.19]That's not a normal cell.
[86:32.58]Uh, shotgun.
[86:33.28]I already have a shotgun, don't I?
[86:37.32]That thing's really powerful.
[86:38.40]Uh, I'll just swap it out with the magnum.
[86:46.91]What are you?
[86:47.53]Hey, what?
[86:51.83]That guy doesn't make any sense.
[86:53.57]It's just a guy.
[86:54.52]Oh, well, cutscene.
[86:55.58]Do you remember the car?
[86:57.92]Well, I'm not gonna bring it in here.
[86:59.26]It's like a cutscene and shit.
[87:00.42]I'll get it when I go out.
[87:09.26]Oh, that's the guy.
[87:11.02]That's the random dude that had to die in the Star Trek episode.
[87:16.91]Oh.
[87:17.87]What?
[87:21.93]Come on.
[87:22.43]Give me a second.
[87:32.47]Fresh zombies.
[87:33.87]I think I have leveled up.
[87:43.08]How do I open this shit?
[87:47.78]Come on.
[87:48.42]Let me in.
[87:56.41]Kill the fresh infected.
[87:58.85]Clear out emergency shelters to unlock vendors and to provide a safe haven for survivors who meet out in the world.
[88:04.12]Vendors sell goods such as combo weapons or maps in exchange for scrap.
[88:07.64]Rescuing survivors will level up the emergency shelter and improve vendor.
[88:10.40]Okay.
[88:12.18]Most shelters run a network connecting them to the Megaplex.
[88:14.79]Clear a shelter and you'll find a Megaplex access door in the basement.
[88:19.45]Cool!
[88:25.21]Oh, another sandwich!
[88:26.65]Cool sandwich!
[88:29.24]Orange juice.
[88:31.28]Okay.
[88:32.98]Let's clear it up.
[88:36.78]What the hell is going on?
[88:44.07]I'm trying to karate kick him.
[88:57.61]is happening right now?
[88:59.01]I want to hit the guy in the ground.
[89:00.19]Alright, I declare you have to hit, press Y and then B. Okay.
[89:08.99]Yeah, that's very finicky.
[89:19.22]You have to be like right in front of him like this and it's Y, right?
[89:22.14]Why is it not hitting him?
[89:25.22]This dude clearly is on the ground.
[89:26.96]Okay.
[89:27.26]You gotta be in, like, the perfect fucking spot to do the stomp on the ground, apparently.
[89:35.03]Okay, game, please.
[89:37.17]I'm very clearly standing above this guy.
[89:40.87]Now do a karate kick forward!
[89:43.57]Oh my fucking god.
[89:44.89]I'm about to drop a fucking grenade on this guy.
[89:49.06]Everyone in this, like...
[89:53.18]What the fuck?!
[89:54.70]Can I stop this guy?!
[89:56.12]He's dead!
[89:59.13]No, he's not.
[90:00.93]There's no sto- I can't stop him.
[90:03.35]It's a finicky piece of shit.
[90:04.69]I can't do it.
[90:09.95]These people are screaming for help while I'm trying to figure out how to step on a guy.
[90:19.06]Help!
[90:23.49]Okay, there we go.
[90:30.70]Please help us.
[90:34.00]This motherfucker can't figure out how to stop.
[90:39.62]I can buy things from this guy?
[90:45.45]Oh boy, here we go.
[90:46.17]Upgrades purchased?
[90:54.98]Zero to eight.
[90:57.36]Why would I spend money on this?
[90:58.40]Because it's... Oh.
[91:07.91]Oh, come on.
[91:10.81]Don't tease me like this, game.
[91:12.17]I want these right now.
[91:15.59]Screw it.
[91:21.91]Good old $2,000 shirt.
[91:23.25]Yeah, I know.
[91:24.47]It's a little ridiculous, if you ask me.
[91:26.01]I think I can level up.
[91:28.31]Did I get a new blueprint, too?
[91:38.87]No, two points.
[91:39.59]Alright.
[91:40.37]Let's go into Fortitude.
[91:41.43]Let's take a look.
[91:45.59]Improves dodge, movement speed, and responsiveness.
[91:50.19]Healing from food increases max health by 50 points.
[91:54.37]Let's do that.
[92:04.35]Critical hits with shotguns.
[92:05.79]Yeah.
[92:08.92]They have a huge spread and it's probably going to be very, very useful in the time going on.
[92:16.55]Have I been watching... Oh, no.
[92:18.45]It said, Hey, Dermot.
[92:18.99]I've been watching since 2014.
[92:21.69]And always love you.
[92:22.87]Have a wonderful night.
[92:23.61]Well, thanks, dude.
[92:24.41]Thanks, Metallic Trees.
[92:26.89]Thank you, KJ8000 for eight months.
[92:29.17]Check in to see Dermot in his underoos beating up zombies with a hammer.
[92:33.26]Quality entertainment like this is why I keep subscribing.
[92:37.54]I'm glad you're enjoying it, dude.
[92:40.56]SNVWVW for three months.
[92:42.58]Mr. Lobster Man Speed Weed.
[92:44.84]Damoli, Stoked Gamer, and Handshoes.
[92:47.07]Thanks, guys.
[92:49.87]Welcome fucking back.
[92:51.25]Alright.
[92:53.45]Locate Vic's hideout, which is apparently right here.
[92:57.73]Vehicle vendor?
[93:00.03]Ooh.
[93:03.30]Toy car?
[93:04.98]I can get on one of these things?
[93:08.56]I kind of want to get on a balancer.
[93:10.98]Except make sure I don't forget it.
[93:14.97]Boogie monster?
[93:15.75]Alright, these things are getting a little out of hand.
[93:20.09]Alright, I'm getting a balance over $3,000.
[93:29.70]Where is it?
[93:33.58]What a waste of fucking money.
[93:35.06]Why did I just do that?
[93:38.08]That was such a fucking waste.
[93:43.43]I'm not even gonna use that.
[93:45.53]I'm gonna barely utilize that.
[93:47.03]Large wrench.
[93:47.71]Yeah, I want that instead of this thing.
[93:58.67]Holy shit, this thing sucks.
[94:05.21]This thing sucks total ass.
[94:08.76]Glad I bought it.
[94:12.39]Alright, let's open the door.
[94:21.96]Ah, drama!
[94:24.85]Hey!
[94:26.01]You been here long?
[94:26.87]You know anything about a reporter named Vic?
[94:29.67]This just doesn't work.
[94:31.87]This doesn't look right.
[94:33.03]I'm going to fuck this up and fall off a cliff or something.
[94:35.65]This thing is so annoying to control.
[94:38.50]Investigate.
[94:39.84]Okay.
[94:40.00]Get out and take pictures.
[94:58.02]Oh, Vic's handwriting.
[94:59.88]What does it say?
[95:04.35]Cute.
[95:05.15]I am too lazy to walk.
[95:06.35]Don't really like to take pictures of all this stupid shit.
[95:13.25]I can't believe it.
[95:13.77]He used the sink one time.
[95:15.18]Unbelievable.
[95:23.08]Alternate vision.
[95:25.60]Spectrum.
[95:26.08]Like, what the fuck does it want?
[95:31.90]Okay.
[95:35.74]I'm gonna take a picture of a computer or something now.
[95:41.64]Oh, here we go.
[95:47.44]I'm gonna take a picture of the computer.
[95:51.79]I'm assuming this is the computer.
[95:53.15]Unlock it.
[95:54.07]Ah, it's gonna tell me to please give me the code with your stupid code.
[95:59.23]Mm-hmm.
[96:01.28]Wait, what?
[96:02.38]Password.
[96:04.51]What?
[96:10.77]Is that a password?
[96:11.45]No, that's like an emergency broadcast.
[96:12.95]Wait, what's this?
[96:16.89]It was like freaking out for a second.
[96:25.91]Wait, why is my...
[96:29.43]Hey, there's a clue in my new shitty scooter.
[96:32.63]What?
[96:32.93]I don't understand.
[96:37.62]Wait, is it on?
[96:38.30]Hold on.
[96:38.72]Move out of the way.
[96:42.68]I slipped.
[96:51.50]Clue detected.
[96:52.64]Oh, no.
[96:52.84]It's over here.
[96:53.66]Okay.
[96:58.76]Ugh, there's the password.
[96:59.86]Okay.
[97:03.79]Go type it in.
[97:04.67]Who am I talking to?
[97:07.33]This guy's like me.
[97:07.87]I just talk to myself all the fucking time in my car and shit.
[97:28.76]Look at how bright this light is.
[97:30.52]That's such a bright light.
[97:32.28]Get to the mall entrance.
[97:33.61]Wait.
[97:37.31]Talk to the survival.
[97:38.15]You can't tell me to go to a mall entrance and then talk to a survivor, man.
[97:46.63]Yeah?
[97:47.23]You need something from me?
[97:48.51]What is it?
[97:49.81]Heard you talking to yourself.
[97:50.91]You're heading to the front entrance.
[97:53.31]You should take the garage towards Medieval Village.
[97:56.15]Every other way's been sealed off since the military showed up.
[97:59.35]Careful, though.
[98:00.57]Those idiots with the gas masks have built some kind of stronghold out in Medieval Village.
[98:06.46]You better go ready for a fight.
[98:08.82]You better stock up while you can.

[98:52.38]Ow, my eyes.
[98:53.24]No.
[99:05.06]Can I not take that thing with me?
[99:08.56]Didn't give me an option to open the door when I was on it, did it?
[99:17.33]Yeah, that was me.
[99:18.07]Sorry.
[99:20.79]Can I?
[99:21.18]Let me leave with the fucking stupid Paul Blart machine.
[99:27.22]Why did I buy this?
[99:29.04]What the fuck?
[99:35.18]Can I go a different way?
[99:36.28]Alright, let's go.
[99:39.57]Let's get out of here.
[99:46.75]I should really renew my license.
[99:49.89]Yep, those are popular.
[99:54.53]I didn't... I didn't... What?
[99:56.49]There was no... Okay.
[99:58.73]Apparently, this just opens.
[100:00.57]You got it.
[100:03.45]What just happened?
[100:04.85]I looked over and there's a black screen now.
[100:06.45]I was going to read like a sub.
[100:07.69]Um, this looks very... Where's my gun?
[100:09.89]Wait, I didn't want to get off this.
[100:13.44]Oh, boy.
[100:25.76]That one's stupid.
[100:29.20]Alright.
[100:30.61]Okay.
[100:31.51]I'm gonna be fine.
[100:32.95]Don't worry.
[100:34.05]Everything's gonna be fine.
[100:42.63]Oh, cool.
[100:43.15]Thanks.
[100:43.93]There's beards in here.
[100:46.87]Definitely taking the pitchfork.
[100:49.39]And I'm full and everything else.
[100:54.55]Let's go.
[100:56.23]Nice.
[100:56.45]See that jump?
[100:56.99]That was a pretty sick jump.
[101:00.81]Can I shoot off this thing?
[101:05.74]Encounter.
[101:06.40]Hold on.
[101:07.62]Hold on.
[101:08.44]There's a person over here I can rescue.
[101:13.12]And then they can give me more items in the shop.
[101:14.72]Did she just say someone damn straight?
[101:22.00]Yeah.
[101:22.38]Alright.
[101:32.84]Hey, it just looks like I'm naked from the behind.
[101:41.47]I would get off this thing, but I kind of don't have to.
[101:51.33]This is lame.
[101:52.09]Hey, thank you!
[101:55.01]I got you with the scooter!
[102:01.14]What's my reward?
[102:06.12]Yeah, what's the reward?
[102:08.83]I've learned my lesson.
[102:10.05]I'm heading to a shelter where it's safe.
[102:12.31]I already have one of those.
[102:14.59]I don't want this.
[102:16.23]Yeah, I don't need... I don't want this.
[102:18.13]I already have two of these now.
[102:19.57]Whatever.
[102:28.34]Poplar 3 looks weird.
[102:31.78]It is a weird movie.
[102:39.45]Get... What are you hitting?
[102:44.35]You're not actually hitting the... Honestly, here.
[102:48.69]You're not gonna let me bring this in?
[102:54.56]You gotta be shitting me.
[103:01.13]Wait, hey!
[103:01.99]Get off!
[103:02.67]Get off of it!
[103:03.67]Get off!
[103:09.02]Ah, fuck!
[103:14.44]It's so dark, I can't see anything.
[103:26.17]I can't fucking see!
[103:28.73]I hope I'm winning the game.
[103:34.17]I need some bracken up kills.
[103:41.04]Level 8.
[103:42.56]I wanna... What's the thing I can level up to get so I can hold more healing items?
[103:46.22]I really want that.
[103:49.30]Oh, by the way, that little stupid scooter was $3,000.
[103:51.75]Remind me to never buy that again.
[103:54.75]Because that thing sucks total ass.
[104:01.23]That thing is a piece of shit.
[104:02.77]Alright, let me steal somebody's fucking bank information.
[104:06.43]Get the fuck, get out of here.
[104:07.53]$4,000?
[104:07.63]Okay, never mind.
[104:08.87]Four fucking grand in that machine.
[104:10.31]Is it the jackpot?
[104:10.97]Shit!
[104:11.15]She's way ahead of me.
[104:30.60]Let me investigate some of these bathroom doors.
[104:34.87]Gym bag?
[104:38.79]Of course, why wouldn't there be like a basketball and boxing gloves in the gym bag?
[104:43.47]I'm swapping out these because I don't... That thing's stupid.
[104:46.00]It's too overpowered.
[104:46.96]It's dumb.
[104:47.44]I'd want to be like the shitty idiot with the boxing gloves.
[104:51.42]I want to be the shitty idiot with the tomahawk.
[104:53.60]You know?
[105:09.44]Okay, why ah Okay, I get it.
[105:14.06]I Don't know for some reason Can't pick that back up Dual swords.
[105:19.30]Okay.
[105:19.44]I want to be the idiot with the dual swords.
[105:20.94]You know, I mean Now this really is blood-borne
[105:39.23]Let's see what it looks like.
[105:40.51]Right in the skull.
[105:42.45]Ooh!
[105:44.11]That's pretty nice.
[105:44.73]Alright, for a second I just freaked out because I thought I lost my, um... Segway.
[105:53.04]But no, it just exploded because it sucks.
[105:55.44]Thought everyone was going to make fun of me for a second.
[105:59.06]Why can I put this on my head?
[106:02.17]I don't know.
[106:07.33]By the way, this game is like dark as shit, isn't it?
[106:09.31]I feel like I want to turn it up.
[106:15.08]Mana potions?
[106:17.96]Oh, yeah.
[106:19.12]Give me that.
[106:20.30]T-Rex head.
[106:21.00]Put it on.
[106:25.54]I can't put the T-Rex head on.
[106:27.26]There has to be a way.
[106:30.49]No, I can... It's funny.
[106:31.51]I can put it on a zombie, but I can't wear it.
[106:33.15]Watch.
[106:33.97]Watch.
[106:40.24]That's not fair.
[106:41.02]Okay, well that's alright.
[106:49.70]I'm okay with that.
[106:51.46]I'm okay with Mr. Sharkman.
[106:56.73]I can't be the Triceratops with a shark on him.
[106:59.69]Executioner's hood.
[107:02.75]Caveman.
[107:08.58]Alright, this is like really creepy.
[107:10.14]No.
[107:11.72]Okay, I gotta like the caveman.
[107:18.90]Caveman or the... Ah, no, the matador for sure.
[107:23.02]Definitely the matador.
[107:27.62]Yeah, it's jebador.
[107:34.58]I wish I could be the matador with the fucking triceratops head.
[107:42.73]The Geico caveman.
[107:46.36]No, see, now I'm gonna be like, THE MATADOR!
[107:50.30]DUAL WELDING!
[107:54.58]Such a fucking cool cosplay!
[108:01.39]I can't pick up the Christmas tree because I have to unlock being able to lift a Christmas tree.
[108:07.43]Wow.
[108:09.19]That's pretty lame.
[108:10.93]If I do say so myself.
[108:12.12]Alright.
[108:14.10]Why is there a chainsaw in a toy store, by the way?
[108:18.04]Seems really unsafe.
[108:24.78]Wait, hold on.
[108:25.52]Can I be a pirate with the caveman?
[108:29.33]No, come on.
[108:30.47]Alright, well, we're going matador costume.
[108:37.77]Pirate hat.
[108:44.57]That works for me.
[108:47.12]For now.
[108:47.40]And then we're going to take the Dancing Santa.
[108:54.42]Get rid of the brass knuckles, stupid.
[108:56.18]Alright, what does the Dancing Santa do?
[109:00.02]Let's find out.
[109:09.31]Dancing Santa.
[109:14.84]No, it just attracts them, I get it.
[109:17.94]Eh.
[109:19.36]IDIOTS!
[109:19.80]This is why, just to talk about grinding, I'm gonna grind some cash here.
[109:29.71]Yeah, how does this move?
[109:40.22]I got plenty of health, I got plenty of stuff.
[109:43.26]Encounter nearby.
[109:52.20]Look, I'm sick, okay?
[109:53.22]I can't help it.
[109:54.34]I can't help that shit.
[109:56.14]I can't.
[110:03.17]Hey, look, I'm gonna have to kill zombies to free the survivor.
[110:06.19]Like the other fucking three I've done.
[110:15.89]This game is dark.
[110:30.04]I hope they're not all like this, because this is real boring.
[110:34.15]The person stands up.
[110:38.27]And why are they always up on a thing like that?
[110:41.68]If I remember correctly, in the other Dead Rising games, the survivors sometimes were, like, covered by zombies, like, being attacked and eaten and shit.
[110:50.86]No, everyone's just on, like, safe, high ground, and waiting for you to kill the zombies to get, like, the free shit that they want.
[110:59.28]Alright, what, what, hold on, there's too many zombies around.
[111:03.19]I can't see in this gray game, hold on.
[111:06.85]What do you need, what do you got?
[111:09.20]Oh, you got a fire starter.
[111:12.84]Okay.
[111:24.36]Turn up the gamma?
[111:26.00]I feel like that won't even help.
[111:27.04]I feel like that would just make it look ugly.
[111:32.51]No, back up.
[111:36.91]I mean, let's...
[111:41.04]Yeah, that did not really help.
[111:42.03]Let's go to the medieval village.
[111:50.97]What the hell is in there?
[111:57.51]Oh, actually, I don't like this.
[112:01.39]Give me the other thing.
[112:04.16]It's too slow.
[112:05.82]This thing's at least slow, but it's extremely broken and stupid.
[112:16.31]Yoga mat?
[112:17.03]I just want to get at least a second where I can pick up one of those balls.
[112:25.64]Alright.
[112:26.34]What is in here?
[112:28.24]Yoga ball.
[112:30.70]I wanted the yoga ball, not the mat.
[112:32.54]This bat sucks.
[112:33.40]Why would I even want this?
[112:34.56]It's not a plate.
[112:35.28]I can't throw it.
[112:35.94]I'm just going to build up like 100 hit combo on this guy with the mat.
[112:46.27]Alright, this shit, that's a waste of fucking time.
[112:48.29]Let's just go.
[112:50.43]Hold on.
[112:59.80]That wouldn't hurt you.
[113:00.54]That would just mildly irritate you.
[113:02.92]Alright, let's go.
[113:04.58]Move on.
[113:04.94]There's a bag here I can open.
[113:20.15]Get rid of this.
[113:21.93]Back to the ranch.
[113:22.59]Alright, open the bag and let's go.
[113:34.79]There's $67 in there.
[113:36.00]Remind me never to do that again and just to rob ATMs.
[113:39.04]Because why would you ever just open a... Why?
[113:43.46]Get out of here, you fucking random zombies.
[113:47.40]Where are they even coming from?
[113:48.20]What the fuck?
[113:48.70]Who's raining the zombies down?
[113:49.82]Who's placing them?
[113:51.45]Which one of you guys has been admin powers right now and is doing that to me?
[113:55.23]Count it out.
[113:56.73]Not cool.
[113:57.15]Give me the other cupcake and get me out of here.
[114:04.48]Let's go.
[114:15.53]I think in here.
[114:16.13]Frickin' mannequin leg.
[114:20.95]Got it.
[114:21.19]Nice.
[114:24.34]Blanca mask.
[114:24.94]Can I put that on?
[114:25.92]I really thought I could.
[114:29.20]Coat hanger.
[114:29.68]Can't throw it, so what's the point of picking it up?
[114:34.42]Hmm.
[114:37.28]Some dumb wreaths.
[114:39.88]Can I knock it in these?
[114:43.22]Eh, whatever.
[114:43.66]Let's just go.
[114:53.12]And let's go!
[114:56.47]Tricycle.
[114:57.65]From the second game.
[114:59.21]Yeah, the third game.
[115:01.55]Oh, watch out.
[115:01.97]There's maniacs nearby.
[115:03.13]Oh.
[115:06.15]Antagonize the hostile survivors.
[115:09.33]Got it.
[115:34.27]You got it.
[115:34.71]That show was the shit.
[115:59.94]Did I antagonize them enough?
[116:02.80]I guess I didn't antagonize them enough.
[116:06.11]Let's try antagonizing them more.
[116:07.33]The world should end more often.
[116:09.61]What the fuck do I do?
[116:18.05]Okay, can you... Did I... Did it work?
[116:22.31]Oh, I... What?
[116:23.61]I did not know the historical shithead society was in town.
[116:39.74]well if queen Sandra is half as inbred as she sounds then she's my kind of lady
[116:57.19]Your mother was a gopher and your father smells of body spray.
[116:59.81]Hey, open up so I can teach this old... Yeah, open it up.
[117:07.76]Shit, shit, shit!
[117:09.60]Hey, Tin Man, I'm not the bad guy here.
[117:15.42]Bleed!
[117:18.04]You sucked.
[117:20.28]You were fucking terrible.
[117:23.50]What makes you think your friend's gonna do any better?
[117:28.92]Whoa, hey.
[117:29.90]Who?
[117:30.50]Where?
[117:31.54]Who?
[117:35.44]I have skill points.
[117:36.20]Hold on.
[117:42.04]Fortitude.
[117:42.90]No, Fortitude.
[117:45.62]Another point into health.
[117:50.19]And... The shotgun damage.
[117:54.69]Let's just be shotgun sickos.
[118:00.60]One more point.
[118:02.17]Oh, the handgun one.
[118:06.09]I think we're golden.
[118:07.57]I have three shots in here.
[118:14.64]She's up there.
[118:15.26]We're going to play this really, really, really, really well.
[118:18.22]Ready?
[118:22.56]Sprint!
[118:28.73]I killed that lady so bad her mask fell off.
[118:32.48]No, that just happens.
[118:34.82]I can't, like, brag anymore.
[118:36.40]I don't care.
[118:37.86]Whatever.
[118:38.14]What is this other person that apparently is over here?
[118:50.11]Oil?
[118:51.79]I'm still playing the music.
[118:52.75]I can't seem to see anybody, though.
[119:00.22]Huh?
[119:01.60]Can I take that guy's full suit of armor?
[119:03.00]Uh, I'll eat.
[119:12.79]Mace.
[119:14.35]Sword and shield?
[119:15.29]Oh, hell yeah.
[119:19.32]Cool.
[119:20.40]Alright, let's keep going.
[119:23.66]Go, go, go, go, go.
[119:24.88]I guess I just have to go around.
[119:27.58]Oh, that's where these people are.
[119:30.18]There's one more bad guy all the way around.
[119:32.04]On the mini-map.
[119:33.84]No, no, they're just here.
[119:35.38]They're just here.
[119:37.14]They're just here.
[119:44.09]Who is this guy?
[119:45.29]What are you doing, buddy?
[119:47.57]You're just causing problems now.
[119:51.60]Didn't hurt him.
[119:56.50]Can't take out the sword and the stone.
[119:57.80]Nope.
[119:59.36]I have to be in an exoskeleton suit.
[120:01.68]Bullshit.
[120:07.96]What else is here?
[120:08.60]Cash register swap.
[120:09.86]No, there's a lot of shit.
[120:13.19]Halberd.
[120:13.75]That's not how you use a halberd, man.
[120:17.61]You really gotta swing it in a circle.
[120:19.21]Ooh!
[120:21.74]Hold that thought, everybody.
[120:23.82]Scimitar.
[120:26.69]Scepter.
[120:27.37]Alright, let's get a full... This thing's almost broken anyway, so let's get the rapier.
[120:36.45]My outfit actually works now, doesn't it?
[120:39.59]Oh, no.
[120:40.15]Let's get the... Now this really is Dark Souls.
[120:45.84]This'll do.
[120:49.48]Dude, I know how to do Dark Souls 1.
[120:51.36]The speed run, you gotta use the rapier first.
[120:53.45]Or Dark Souls 3, sorry.
[120:54.39]There's a blueprint.
[121:01.51]Acid ball, okay.
[121:04.65]Crossbow.
[121:08.24]Battle axe.
[121:09.26]Arthur's helmet.
[121:14.34]That sucks.
[121:21.64]Well, we're just gonna go.
[121:24.58]My stupid golden helmet.
[121:30.02]Portable stereo.
[121:31.22]Pitchfork.
[121:32.96]I feel like I can eat.
[121:34.12]Yeah, lots of food over here.
[121:36.99]Cool.
[121:37.71]Whatever.
[121:38.15]Let's just move.
[121:40.49]Oh, look out.
[121:41.37]Bad guys.
[121:42.27]Okay.
[121:49.13]Carry that axe in her head.
[121:51.07]Ooh, crossbow, let's try it.
[121:59.75]Right in the head.
[122:06.41]Zombies take more hits than the actual super humans.
[122:11.09]Let's swap this out.
[122:13.10]Get a fresh one.
[122:17.40]Helmet doesn't matter.
[122:21.09]Hair dryer.
[122:22.23]Let me get some food.
[122:26.67]Oh, a tomato.
[122:29.51]See ya.
[122:33.01]Oh, yeah.
[122:34.23]Get back on a tricycle.
[122:44.76]Where am I supposed to be going?
[122:46.32]Over on the mall entrance over here?
[122:55.03]Are you shitting me right now?
[122:59.18]I should have done something.
[123:02.62]Okay, your weapon is way cooler than mine.
[123:05.68]This guy just like helped you do that.
[123:22.77]Sorry, Sandra.
[123:23.63]There can only be one knight of the round table.
[123:28.70]And it's me!
[123:30.02]You know, it's just not a real apocalypse without at least a few whack jobs.
[123:32.46]You need to stand back up to die.
[123:37.60]Level 10.
[123:39.78]This really is Dark Souls.
[123:42.26]Except in Dark Souls, you can't sit in a wheelchair.
[123:50.80]This just doesn't even fit.
[123:57.75]Did she drop anything?
[123:58.47]She didn't drop anything.
[124:03.26]Where's her cool sword?
[124:04.34]Where's her boss weapon?
[124:09.62]Get that sword.
[124:11.32]Where the fuck did she even... Where is it?
[124:19.09]I don't see a flame sword anywhere.
[124:21.27]Come on, old girl!
[124:26.48]That's what you fucking get.
[124:27.68]It's by the blood?
[124:33.74]Where, this way?
[124:37.94]No, there it is.
[124:38.43]Okay, cool.
[124:50.49]Okay, well, that just happened.
[124:53.62]Now, Vic seemed to think the outbreak started at the mall's front entrance.
[124:57.12]Better go check it out.
[125:00.06]Go to the front entrance.
[125:01.32]Alright, while we go here... God damn it.
[125:04.15]No, the... I don't want to waste this.
[125:12.01]This thing's so much faster.
[125:16.48]Oh, I like it.
[125:22.10]There's an encounter.
[125:29.80]Where are you?
[125:31.32]I should make him walk.
[125:39.02]Oh, somebody's standing up on a thing.
[125:40.10]I need to run over with my tricycle.
[125:43.11]Ow.
[125:43.97]My face.
[125:49.01]I got it.
[125:49.47]Don't worry.
[125:50.70]Here's the strategy, guys.
[125:55.10]You just slowly drive over everybody.
[125:59.02]Eventually, you'll get to a position where you'll win.
[126:01.02]That's all you gotta do.
[126:10.63]Merry Christmas.
[126:15.43]Why risk injury?
[126:17.83]You don't have to.
[126:22.82]What happened to my helmet?
[126:36.33]Mmm, two more left.
[126:37.33]Come on, hurry up!
[126:45.56]That's it, right?
[126:46.10]Ugh, god.
[126:46.84]Alright, why don't you give me my money?
[126:54.84]What is it?
[126:57.44]A blambo!
[126:58.42]Oh, I have one of those already.
[127:00.97]But thanks.
[127:02.63]You gave me extra ammo for mine.
[127:06.23]Come on, what the fuck?
[127:10.65]That's such a piece of shit.
[127:12.23]Where's the timer?
[127:13.13]This game just doesn't have a timer.
[127:19.34]Damn, no timer.
[127:22.98]I was waiting for the tutorial to be over.
[127:30.24]Watch out!
[127:32.44]Humans!
[127:37.30]Watch out!
[127:38.92]Humans!
[127:40.64]Headshot.
[127:41.08]Watch this.
[127:41.47]Three.
[127:42.91]Two.
[127:43.59]No, come on.
[127:44.13]Come on.
[127:44.65]Right in the fucking head.
[127:45.51]I know I can do it.
[127:48.47]I would have done it.
[127:49.51]Hold on.
[127:49.79]I can get it.
[127:50.19]I can still get a headshot here.
[127:53.95]No, there's like a wall in his way.
[127:55.25]What the hell am I talking about here?
[128:03.01]I know I can do it.
[128:04.85]I know I can.
[128:08.92]God damn it!
[128:14.06]I know I can!
[128:17.08]The Star Wars music is playing!
[128:18.40]That's how you know something's going down!
[128:26.99]What is happening?
[128:36.70]What?
[128:37.02]I just... Why was that not actually hitting?
[128:43.95]Is there a shield right here?
[128:50.69]Can we call a timeout?
[128:52.41]Just a little one.
[128:55.97]Oh no, more military!
[129:00.27]Military's in... Nice aim!
[129:14.48]Come on, I'm on a controller!
[129:17.82]It's not easy.
[129:19.75]It's not easy being cheesy.
[129:21.47]Get rid of the crossbows.
[129:24.23]Give me my shotguns.
[129:29.68]Give me the assault rifle, you fucking idiot.
[129:34.02]Wait, actually, I can... What can I do this?
[129:35.34]Combo?
[129:36.72]Ooh!
[129:37.68]Lambo!
[129:42.31]Nice.
[129:42.59]Alright, well, then I'm replacing this stupid Lambo with another machine gun.
[129:49.87]Wait, the... What?
[129:52.55]Did you hear that?
[129:54.97]That was my heater.
[129:56.75]My heaters are even pissed at me.
[130:00.62]Alright, I can do this.
[130:20.08]What is he doing?
[130:21.00]I hit him in the head with that.
[130:22.32]He's just backing up over here.
[130:33.98]What the fuck was that?
[130:41.46]I hope I do it to this guy and he does the same thing.
[130:46.33]Ah, damn it.
[130:48.59]I need more flare guns.
[130:49.51]That's the funnest thing this whole game.
[130:54.19]I bopped him on the head and I actually gave him a mental problem.
[131:00.49]Like, you remember in South Park when Cartman, like, hits his little buddy on the head with, like, a wrench?
[131:05.12]That's what just happened.
[131:07.62]How do I fuck with this guy, too?
[131:08.96]Come on.
[131:09.38]I'm gonna throw a snuggle up with this guy.
[131:20.47]That didn't work.
[131:30.03]Come on, don't aggro him yet.
[131:32.61]Perfect.
[131:38.95]Who's... It's not even hurting him?
[131:44.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[131:55.14]What are we doing here?
[131:56.20]What am I doing right now?
[131:58.19]Go get him!
[131:59.69]Go fucking get the guy!
[132:05.54]Honest to God!
[132:06.36]That was so stupid!
[132:07.98]Oh, it did hurt him.
[132:25.24]Don't you fucking know shit when you pick it up.
[132:28.58]Alright, watch this, guys.
[132:29.54]You want to see fucking like a 10 out of 10 move?
[132:31.58]Here it comes.
[132:33.84]Here it comes.
[132:34.58]10 out of 10.
[132:37.13]Why?
[132:37.53]Why?
[132:39.43]Why?
[132:52.88]Okay, I'm glad we're both fucking idiots.
[132:54.92]I'm glad we're both total morons.
[132:58.24]This guy was running around in circles.
[133:00.64]He couldn't understand it.
[133:08.72]I'm trying to pick up the coffee.
[133:10.04]Shut up, game.
[133:10.34]Jesus.
[133:18.31]Can I get in this?
[133:19.19]Please tell me I can get in the giant truck.
[133:21.65]Oh.
[133:22.97]That's funny.
[133:25.37]Was he trying to dodge around me?
[133:26.83]Is that what it was?
[133:29.98]Do I have this on easy or something?
[133:33.84]Tag to keep... No.
[133:34.82]I have to do this.
[133:39.30]What a dumb feature to put in this game.
[133:43.14]If that just wasn't in this game, like, I'm sure nobody would care.
[133:46.59]By the way, I haven't taken very many pictures, have I?
[134:03.32]I'm only doing this because at the end of the game, it's going to be like, oh, take a look at your photos.
[134:08.12]And I'm going to be really upset that there's five chairs in a row.
[134:19.30]This is part of a... We'll take the keyboard.
[134:27.96]Why not?
[134:28.84]Oh, hold on.
[134:33.90]Slicing beauty.
[134:36.16]Propane tank in a knife.
[134:38.84]Well, I have a propane tank.
[134:42.02]And I believe this... Is this a knife?
[134:44.84]Not really.
[134:46.69]I have a bow and knife, don't I?
[134:47.93]No, don't.
[134:48.29]You fucking idiot.
[134:51.77]ball.
[134:52.13]Is that a knife on the corner?
[134:56.67]There it is.
[134:59.64]Just drop the fucking stupid-ass ball.
[135:02.72]Now it's in the way, and I'm not going to be able to pick up the knife.
[135:04.98]There's a folding chair in the way.
[135:06.20]I don't see what this does.
[135:10.65]Alright, combo.
[135:15.25]Make it.
[135:22.21]So what does this do?
[135:23.03]Man, I can barely make myself a sandwich.
[135:25.31]Okay, it's just like a giant explosive thing?
[135:29.32]Well, I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later, right?
[135:34.30]Flaming sword, we're going to hold on to that.
[135:35.70]Let's just take the scimitar out.
[135:38.26]And go in the quarantine room and progress the way.
[135:41.00]Let me get another, take another propane tank.
[135:42.68]I'm going to need it for something.
[135:45.24]Not the fucking ball.
[135:46.88]The ball was on the other side.
[135:49.48]of the room.
[135:50.64]Why?
[135:50.84]I still have it.
[135:52.24]I still have the ball.
[135:54.24]Put the ball down.
[135:59.49]Alright.
[136:01.51]Cell phone.
[136:04.21]I want to pick up the cell phone, not open the door.
[136:06.88]Starting to annoy me.
[136:15.59]While I have a second here, I want to say thanks to Hunley the Fool for two months.
[136:20.28]Based in Space Mr. Sneak Man.

[136:34.81]I got into the stream.
[136:35.57]Are you feeling any better?
[136:36.43]You at least don't sound like you're dying anymore.
[136:38.49]No, I'm alright.
[136:39.25]I'll be better by, like, Thursday or Friday.
[136:41.57]I think I'll be 100%.
[136:43.43]Voido, thank you for the new sub.

[136:54.88]Purple gave 200.
[136:55.36]Thanks, guys.
[136:57.92]Bunch of people came with 100 bits.
[136:59.08]You guys are fucking awesome.
[137:02.52]Let's go.
[137:05.25]Well, set my balls on fire.
[137:07.29]What the shit happened here?
[137:14.78]What?
[137:17.70]I want to take like a picture of this, isn't it?
[137:19.28]I'm supposed to be taking a picture of this shit.
[137:20.60]No!
[137:20.88]Two pictures and a key card!
[137:22.26]Oh.
[137:23.89]Hold on, I'm analyzing.
[137:31.31]God.
[137:34.19]We figured it out.
[137:34.95]Open.
[137:40.16]Investigate the area.
[137:42.46]No.
[137:55.47]More of this shit.
[137:59.59]Chemicals, yeah.
[138:00.45]Dump the chemicals on this dead motherfucker's body.
[138:06.58]Wait, can I do something with these?
[138:13.20]Right, I can do... Can I add to this?
[138:20.32]Does that just make another one?
[138:21.78]This better work.
[138:23.36]Okay, now I just have two.
[138:25.44]Okay.
[138:28.41]Well, let's get a picture of you.
[138:35.43]These military assholes were investigating what happened here.
[138:40.95]Oh, God!
[138:41.73]Somebody just gave fucking a hundred bucks!
[138:45.82]What am I doing?
[138:46.34]I'm throwing all my weapons on the ground.
[138:47.66]No, stop it.
[138:48.44]Stop it.
[138:48.70]Hold on.
[138:49.00]Uh...
[138:50.65]He missed it.
[138:51.45]He missed it.
[138:51.91]No, I was just... Hold on.
[138:52.75]Hold on.
[138:53.11]I'm sorry.
[138:56.07]Holy shit.
[138:56.61]Who just gave a hundred fucking dollars?
[138:59.01]Mr. Sneakman.
[138:59.81]This is bake-staved.
[139:03.17]Back-staved.
[139:05.81]Dude, Mr. Sneakman, that's fucking insane.
[139:11.83]Money stream.
[139:12.63]It just has to say back-staved.
[139:20.73]Well, regardless, man, that's... $100 is a lot of fucking money.
[139:25.27]Alright, I'm gonna have to... This is a joke specific to you.
[139:29.84]You get a $100 joke.
[139:30.20]Are you ready?
[139:30.58]Shit.
[139:42.21]Uh, hold on.
[139:42.53]I got a burrito.

[139:43.41]We got my improv class.
[139:44.21]Improv.
[139:44.45]Got a burrito.
[139:45.65]Uh, throw some words on here.

[139:47.93]Okay.
[139:48.17]Uh, I'm in an office building.
[139:49.75]I'm an office guy.
[139:51.35]Office building.
[139:51.83]Set it down.
[139:52.23]Uh, typing away at the keyboard.
[139:54.15]Uh, one of my co-workers comes up with a burrito.
[139:56.39]Hey, Tim.
[139:57.21]Uh, here's a burrito for you.
[139:58.28]Oh, thanks, man.
[139:58.78]Thanks for the burrito, man.
[139:59.54]Where'd you get it?
[140:00.18]At Qdoba?
[140:01.14]Yeah, I did.
[140:02.26]Ha, fuck you, Tim.
[140:04.24]And then I take a sip of the coffee.
[140:06.02]Oh, that was worth it.
[140:06.68]Wait, what?
[140:09.34]And then I steal a computer from work.
[140:17.32]I'm sorry.
[140:17.76]Thanks, dude.
[140:18.28]That's fucking very generous of you.

[141:07.03]That's me.
[141:07.57]I'm God.
[141:10.05]You understand?
[141:11.87]Would a God hold two toasters like this?

[141:52.93]I hope so.
[141:54.27]Alright, let's go.
[141:55.91]Hey, that's my job.
[141:56.63]Oh, wait.
[141:56.83]I'm going to take the camera out.

[142:04.91]Are you getting warmer?
[142:05.93]Hold on.
[142:06.49]Hot, cold.

[143:03.18]Isn't this fun?
[143:04.16]Hey, remember that fun game you were just playing?
[143:15.25]Well, we don't do that anymore.
[143:16.79]Do this.
[143:18.65]Oh, look at that.
[143:23.92]God.
[143:24.60]What the hell am I even looking at?
[143:26.16]Yeah.
[143:27.42]Soldiers didn't do this.
[143:29.02]Joke's off the rails tonight.
[143:31.71]Oh, shit.
[143:32.05]It's Gary.
[143:32.51]Oh, my God.
[143:34.09]Look at this.
[143:34.61]I've been trying to get in here for weeks.
[143:37.77]Holy shit.
[143:39.53]You've seen too much.
[143:41.27]What are you doing?
[143:42.29]Get out of here.
[143:43.31]Calm down, pal.
[143:44.57]There's plenty to go around.
[143:45.77]Okay.
[143:50.56]Sorry it is up.
[143:52.24]My scene.
[143:52.98]Beat it.
[143:55.29]Oh, you're Frank West.
[143:58.98]You're the hero of Willamette.
[144:01.06]Hey, man, name's Darcy.
[144:02.54]We should totally work together, you know?
[144:04.90]Share the story.
[144:06.52]Right.
[144:07.70]Seriously.
[144:08.64]Oh, you have to meet my girlfriend.
[144:10.66]I wish, man.
[144:11.40]It would be fucking so great.
[144:12.84]She's got a podcast.
[144:13.68]It's really popular.
[144:14.50]Oh, she's got a podcast.
[144:15.60]Have you ever had acid in your face before?
[144:18.90]Obscurus?
[144:19.94]Try it.
[144:20.22]I swear it's ecto-cooler.
[144:21.90]Yeah, Paula's an expert on them.
[144:24.65]Old Town.
[144:26.19]Now it's a Warcraft game.
[144:27.75]Funny streamer.
[144:28.57]Oh, my God.
[144:30.15]Frank West.
[144:30.57]I can't believe it.
[144:31.67]I know.
[144:32.62]It's so cool, isn't it?
[144:33.92]Now imagine if that happened.
[144:35.52]I wasted two bullets.
[144:36.64]I'm sorry.
[144:53.08]Okay, new, new, new, new, new.
[144:54.86]Tactical briefings, okay.
[144:57.28]Yeah, who cares about any of this?
[144:59.26]We got new points.
[145:00.00]Three points.
[145:01.66]In the... Please, game.
[145:05.89]Shooting.
[145:07.43]What do I need for this?
[145:10.73]I need to be level 15.
[145:11.97]Well... Fuck that, then.
[145:15.11]Survival.
[145:15.51]I don't have anything in survival.
[145:19.63]Might as well... mmmm.
[145:22.63]Do I really care about any of this shit?
[145:27.63]$100 joke stream. Bonus peepee.
[145:34.63]Who cares?
[145:36.63]In photography mode the controller will vibrate when something-
[145:39.63]I turned off vibrating controller so that's not gonna help.
[145:45.63]Increases- alright this is what I'm talking about. Food inventory slots. I want this.
[145:53.69]Yeah.
[145:54.99]Even I'm gonna go down this whole damn tree just because, you know.
[145:58.93]When crafting a combo item, there's a chance that the scrap is generated.
[146:01.51]Increase the speed and effectiveness of sneak kills.
[146:04.29]Wait, that can do sneak kills?
[146:08.76]Brawling, I probably should just put, yeah.
[146:12.78]At least get the first tier of everything.
[146:15.70]Otherwise, you're kind of just shitty.
[146:19.65]Spencer's taking off.
[146:21.57]Where's Spencer going?
[146:22.37]Sorry, I almost broke the stream chat.
[146:24.73]Oh, well.
[146:25.33]Spencer, I hope the cookies are delicious.
[146:26.65]Thanks for hanging out, dude.
[146:29.63]Who turns off vibration?
[146:31.16]I don't like it.
[146:32.28]It's like... You know what I'm saying?
[146:40.96]Alright, beat chapter one.
[146:42.78]I seriously thought that was his dick.
[146:47.95]It's his hand.
[146:48.57]I was about to say, what are they thinking?
[146:50.63]I thought that was his fucking balls and penis.
[146:52.59]It's his hand.
[146:57.69]I quickly learned two things.
[146:59.85]One, Vic's been here for goddamn weeks, and she took an interest in this paramilitary group and the goings-on at the mall's front entrance, which, and this is the second thing I learned, turns out to be the bloodiest, ugliest, weirdest thing I have ever seen.
[147:15.64]Definitely not front-page material, depending on the publication.
[147:19.10]It is front-page material.
[147:20.42]I am front-page material.
[147:22.30]But they sure ain't handing out blankets either.
[147:24.79]So I'm heading into Willamette.
[147:29.69]This looks like a fun story mission in this whisper stream?

[148:13.66]52-year-old intern, yeah.
[148:15.42]Can I get another vehicle, please?
[148:17.80]Goddamn, my fans are weird.
[148:33.53]Can't take any of these cars.
[148:35.51]Wow.
[148:38.42]I just heard a rat, I think.
[148:39.28]Eh, who cares?
[148:42.62]Oh, actually, I do care because I can hold more.
[148:45.98]I can hold more tomatoes.
[148:53.18]What's in the back of the truck?

[149:31.05]Okay.
[149:57.58]Move two vehicles and hold B to combo them.
[150:05.94]Maybe I don't want to.
[150:06.82]Maybe I just want to take this one.
[150:11.77]That significantly shrunk that car.
[150:13.25]Wow.
[150:13.69]You've never done this before, have you?
[150:15.63]I only took shop class to meet girls.
[150:17.57]Well, I think my chances are better on my own.
[150:19.77]This thing sucks.
[150:20.59]Give me the giant tank.
[150:23.07]Uh, thanks.
[150:25.00]How do I shoot it?

[153:03.65]Holy shit.
[153:04.59]Look at the stuff in here, guys.
[153:11.80]What do we have here?
[153:12.84]Exoskeleton suit.
[153:15.64]Are you kidding me?
[153:17.02]Okay.
[153:17.38]What do I do with this?
[153:17.94]How do I use this?
[153:20.08]What do I do?
[153:25.22]What?
[153:27.12]Oh boy!
[153:35.10]Take out the gun!
[153:36.18]Take it out!
[153:46.43]Alright, I gotta move.
[153:47.99]I gotta move.
[153:55.37]Holy shit.
[154:00.54]There's another thing in here.
[154:01.38]I gotta get the melee weapon too and then get out of here.
[154:07.34]Alright, get back in.
[154:08.70]I don't want to lose this just yet.
[154:11.52]Get me in the car.
[154:14.60]What the fuck just happened?
[154:17.62]Why did it all come off?
[154:20.58]What?
[154:20.86]Ahhhh!
[154:26.06]Why?
[154:27.12]I wanted to get in a car!
[154:30.54]What the flying fuck?
[154:33.32]You gotta be kidding me.
[154:36.17]It's not gone, right?
[154:39.77]I wanted to get in a car, so my exoskeleton suit exploded.
[154:43.87]Give me a fucking break.
[154:45.15]It's not even here.
[154:45.76]That is so dumb.
[154:49.28]Words can't even describe how angry I am right now about that.
[155:00.17]Can't drive with the XL suit on.
[155:03.35]And this is going to explode.
[155:04.89]Okay.
[155:06.13]Well, it's been fun.
[155:08.81]Good thing I even got back in the stupid car in the first place.
[155:18.16]Now we walk.
[155:21.98]You can't ride cars with exosuits?
[155:23.96]Well, it would have been nice if it just said, I can't ride cars with exosuits.
[155:27.88]Not, it peels off my skin now.
[155:32.11]There's an event over here, too.
[155:42.81]Destroy this guy's equipment.
[155:44.11]Okay.
[155:45.27]Okay.
[155:50.56]That was easy.
[155:51.12]Holy shit, there's a lot of you.
[156:05.69]Somebody... They just exploded for some reason.
[156:15.52]What did that do for me?
[156:18.62]Will you please?
[156:25.53]No, there's two idiots over there.
[156:26.79]It's alright, I'm fine.
[156:28.77]Is that honey?
[156:31.23]Fancy liquid nitrogen.
[156:33.37]Oh my god, will you fuck off, zombie?
[156:38.50]You're really ruining this for me.
[156:39.70]I thought it was gonna explode!
[157:06.20]He even apologized before he exploded.
[157:09.19]I'm sorry!
[157:10.25]I'm sorry!
[157:15.03]Fancy liquid nitrogen.
[157:16.27]Alright, well I don't want that.
[157:22.26]Well, kind.
[157:22.86]Alright, let's go.
[157:32.57]That's so disappointing that I can't have my Exoskeleton.
[157:35.53]Bugged Millennium Boy.
[157:40.43]Chainsaw.
[157:40.87]I can't pick any of this up.
[157:43.15]It's so depressing.
[157:48.86]Nailgun.
[157:49.34]That's not even... That's not even close to being as fun.
[157:52.22]Ooh, Flare Gun.
[158:06.42]Nice, they're homing missiles.
[158:08.08]Did I lose my rocket launcher?
[158:11.81]No.
[158:17.57]Okay.
[158:17.99]Continue.
[158:21.37]I missed my bake stave?
[158:23.81]Mr. Sneak Man, you missed it?
[158:25.85]Ten bucks?
[158:27.55]Time for another joke.
[158:28.93]Oh, shit.
[158:29.43]We're going to do a... Okay, this is a $10 joke.
[158:32.58]$10 jokes are not $100 jokes, you know what I'm saying?
[158:38.49]Here you go, here's your $10 joke.
[158:40.13]Here it comes.
[158:48.98]That wasn't the joke?
[158:49.92]Okay, I promise that wasn't the joke.
[158:51.60]I thought I just blew myself off the screen and disappeared.
[158:54.86]Hold on, I'll give you a $10 joke in a second.
[158:59.51]Don't shoot that here.
[159:01.77]That's an explosive, too.
[159:03.05]What the fuck are you thinking?
[159:08.91]Meet up with Paula.
[159:09.71]Paula, where are you?
[159:10.55]Are you in the truck?
[159:12.99]I have a $10 joke to do.
[159:16.19]Hello?
[159:21.01]Paula, I'd appreciate it if you opened the door.
[159:37.06]Alright.
[159:41.24]Psst!
[159:42.05]Frank!
[159:42.23]Over here!
[159:44.45]Bugs at the door.
[159:45.75]I gained a skill point.
[159:47.97]Let's put it in.
[159:53.61]Ice-based crits.
[159:55.53]Durability of vehicles.
[159:56.81]Yes.
[159:59.90]And... And... Fortitude.
[160:04.72]We'll put another one in Fortitude.
[160:07.50]More HP.
[160:10.78]Another 10.
[160:11.52]Hold on a second.
[160:14.12]Alright, Mr. Sneakman has given 20 more dollars.
[160:18.04]CGF gave money too, and now he needs another joke.
[160:20.69]He needs a good joke.
[160:21.71]He gave $120.
[160:22.43]Holy shit, dude.
[160:24.29]Alright, hold on.
[160:25.43]I gotta really think of something funny then.
[160:26.73]Damn.
[160:28.37]Multitrip also gave 1,000 bits.
[160:29.81]They say, ooh, daddy.
[160:32.21]Alright, thanks, dude.
[160:33.11]I appreciate the 10 bucks, man.
[160:36.60]Mew gave 360.
[160:37.66]Here's the rest of my bits.
[160:38.56]Merry Halloween.
[160:39.26]Thank you, dude.
[160:43.12]And on the sub front, we've got Megacarp for 10 months.
[160:47.33]I'm Mint Me.
[160:50.67]Thank you for two months.
[160:52.39]Much appreciated.
[160:54.45]No, this is not going to be worth it.
[160:55.69]This is 1,500 more bits.
[160:56.21]You guys are fucking money men.
[161:01.77]15 bucks from Carl.
[161:03.55]Alright, fuck.
[161:05.43]I gotta think of something funny to do right now.
[161:07.23]It's gotta happen right now.
[161:08.09]It's gotta happen within the next 10 seconds.
[161:11.64]Fuck.
[161:12.30]Okay, hold on.
[161:13.20]Give me a countdown.
[161:14.24]Give me 30 seconds.
[161:17.12]Give me a minute.
[161:17.62]Give me 40 minutes.
[161:18.38]She just said I could do it for 40 minutes.
[161:20.92]Okay.
[161:28.07]This is a cutscene here.
[161:28.89]You gotta give me a minute.
[161:30.19]Yeah, I realize no one listens to me unless I'm yelling all the time.
[161:33.57]And also... No, it's a cutscene.
[161:35.42]It doesn't count.
[161:36.90]So, if you're ready to listen, maybe you should look around and see what Obscurus was doing here.
[161:42.36]Right.
[161:43.32]I will.
[161:44.80]Thank you.
[161:46.78]No, I don't want to do this.
[161:48.14]I can't make... Goddammit.
[161:57.50]I don't want to do... this shit right now.
[162:01.12]Shit!
[162:02.60]Doesn't count, yeah.
[162:03.60]Multi-trip, thanks for the ten bucks.
[162:07.36]I have to do this for like another ten minutes.
[162:09.12]So you're gonna have to give me a second here.
[162:17.73]We don't want to be let down.
[162:18.79]I won't let you down.
[162:24.79]But first I need to aimlessly walk around.
[162:30.34]And like take pictures of things.
[162:34.82]What am I looking at here?
[162:35.88]I don't even know.
[162:38.00]Point of interest detected.
[162:39.38]Oh, it's the stupid map, right?
[162:40.68]Yeah, of course it is.
[162:44.57]Thinking of a joke.
[162:45.33]Person of interest.
[162:46.91]I know who that is.
[162:47.95]Is it an obscure?
[162:49.05]Hold on.
[162:49.49]Is it Obscurius?
[162:49.97]That's from fucking Harry Potter.
[162:57.88]It's an obscurial.
[162:58.78]We're tracking a Harry Potter villain?
[163:01.88]Ten dollar joke!
[163:11.25]Oh, who- who wants a joke?
[163:20.49]Hurry up or I'll bake stave you again.
[163:22.33]I know, that was an obscurial.
[163:23.93]I just did a Harry Potter joke.
[163:29.06]Hey, what is... We're tracking an Obscurial.
[163:32.61]Is Eddie Redmayne going to come down here with a briefcase?
[163:35.01]$20 joke.
[163:37.28]I got it.
[163:52.78]Cold medicine.
[163:53.44]Hey, I need that cold medicine right now.
[163:55.38]They knew I was going to have it.
[163:57.58]They knew I was going to need that cold medicine.
[164:00.83]What else is in here?
[164:02.11]Ooh.
[164:06.23]A canister.
[164:08.07]New joke.
[164:08.69]Oh, fucking God, no.
[164:09.89]You don't want money for jokes.
[164:12.19]But thank you for the $11, I'm me.
[164:13.01]I'm mint.
[164:17.03]The filing system is so 1985.
[164:18.83]Okay, well, can I please get... I'm trying to take a picture of the filing system, but, you know.
[164:26.04]You know.
[164:32.90]Why do I need to be closer to this?
[164:34.42]Okay.
[164:34.64]Need jokes now.
[164:35.24]Well, that's an $11 joke, so...
[164:48.78]What?
[164:49.18]Is that a person?
[164:54.06]God damn it.
[164:55.18]I hate this part of the game.
[164:56.40]Filing cabinets just open up every filing cabinet.
[164:59.06]This is... This is...
[165:17.19]It looks like Obscurial is searching through the filing cabinets.
[165:19.63]A plus.
[165:22.47]Oh, man.
[165:23.11]Now, let's see.
[165:29.66]Put up the light again, please.
[165:37.80]Yeah, but maybe the Obscurial came in here.
[165:41.82]I know.
[165:42.48]I know.
[165:42.68]I have to look in the filing cabinets.
[165:54.02]This is really hurting my body.
[165:55.28]I know.
[165:58.15]Oh, look!
[165:58.41]You found a blank piece of paper!
[166:04.47]Hooray, you can leave now.
[166:08.61]That was a 12 out of 26 cent joke?
[166:24.32]Why'd the chicken cross the road?
[166:28.42]She's trying to get to the McDonald's.
[166:31.45]Sniper.
[166:31.63]Time for a sniper.
[166:32.07]Time for a sniper.
[166:32.45]Vitamins for a healthy boy.
[166:54.09]Find the drug store.
[166:57.15]Okay, that whole thing could have been summed up in, like, less than five minutes.
[167:01.71]I'm glad I walked around in the dark with a camera.
[167:06.34]Key.
[167:06.50]What was that?
[167:23.89]It's like a... pirouette.
[167:25.87]A pirouette.
[167:26.45]What is it?
[167:26.73]A- a- a- clea?
[167:31.73]Get out of the way, you fucking wankers.
[167:34.73]Oh my god.
[167:38.73]You don't have to shelter. Sure, why not?
[167:40.73]I should go back to my shelter, shouldn't I? And buy some things.
[167:46.73]That's a hundred meters away?
[167:52.66]Why? Are you putting this this far away from me?
[167:57.14]I have a drugstore to find.
[168:03.63]I can't go in the front door, can I?
[168:04.87]I guess I can.
[168:07.53]Clear it out.
[168:08.61]Clear out the shelter.
[168:11.37]Please get down!
[168:16.56]Here comes the cleaner!
[168:30.54]Got it.
[168:33.38]What's left?
[168:33.80]Anything left?
[168:38.13]Bad guys downstairs?
[168:52.39]Oh, shit.
[168:53.07]He's still alive.
[168:56.20]Alright.
[168:57.40]New shelter.
[168:58.82]Very cool.
[169:02.63]Whoa, cool catchphrase.
[169:03.76]Like, here comes the cleaner.
[169:05.18]It wasn't a catchphrase.
[169:07.64]I was just describing what I was and what I was doing.
[169:11.96]Come on, man.
[169:16.66]Are there any survivors that actually are in here?
[169:20.46]Because I actually want to try to buy some things.
[169:24.95]Give me the dinner bell.
[169:25.63]There actually is a bell, isn't it?
[169:34.13]Uh, any food in here?
[169:35.75]Cooking oil.
[169:38.74]Coffee pot.
[169:39.82]Cell phone.
[169:41.42]Well, I get 500p.
[169:42.94]Here comes the cleaner.
[169:47.38]That wasn't a joke!
[169:50.10]I was stating what I was doing.
[169:52.63]That was not- I didn't describe that as a joke.
[169:56.23]Hey, you want a joke?
[169:56.95]Here.
[169:57.19]Don't open this shit inside!
[170:00.73]It's gonna be bad luck!
[170:05.67]Can't open it.
[170:06.31]Joke's ruined.
[170:06.83]Never mind.
[170:07.77]No more jokes.
[170:08.31]We're done with jokes.
[170:09.61]We're moving on.
[170:15.73]I'm gonna bell somebody.
[170:19.93]Okay, what can you do for me?
[170:23.67]Mustache?
[170:24.63]Should I get a... You can't even see the mustache underneath my fake beard.
[170:33.29]Now go kill some zombies.
[170:35.18]Vehicle vendor.
[170:35.88]This is what I'm talking about.
[170:38.46]Sedan.
[170:38.90]Uh-huh.
[170:40.78]Yeah.
[170:41.24]Perfect.
[170:42.58]I will take the dumb Ford Focus.
[170:46.82]What is this thing?
[170:48.12]This thing's got teeth.
[170:49.00]Uh...
[171:06.25]Fuck, I wouldn't have bought the stupid shitty sedan.
[171:08.13]I would have held on to the other thing.
[171:12.17]Alright, close.
[171:12.83]Weapon vendor.
[171:14.08]What do you got?
[171:17.28]Permanent upgrades.
[171:20.76]Chuck and chop?
[171:23.50]Acid grenade plunger lure.
[171:26.74]Well... Ion cannon?
[171:33.99]You can't put Ion Cannon on this list and not have me get it.
[171:36.67]I'm buying the Ion Cannon.
[171:42.60]Why not, right?
[171:43.12]Of course I'm gonna buy it.
[171:45.92]Renegade Costa, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[171:47.46]We're not done with jokes.
[171:52.24]Thank you, Renegade.
[171:53.04]Thank you.
[171:53.98]Never trust a purple again with 10 bucks as well.
[171:56.14]The third floor corridor is off limits to all first years.
[171:58.64]Aww.
[172:04.46]Let's get Fappy, thanks for the sub.
[172:06.27]Elac 18, thanks for two months.
[172:07.65]Megacarp, thank you for the ten months.
[172:10.13]I think I already got you, but thanks.
[172:13.55]Ion Cannon, let's get it.
[172:18.23]Hehe, Nut Blaster.
[172:21.93]Alright, let me take a very hard look at this stuff.
[172:24.29]I have one more slot for ranged.
[172:27.71]My melee is... I still haven't even touched these.
[172:29.91]Still have the Flamesword, which I'm still afraid to use for some reason.
[172:35.65]Alright, let's just go.
[172:37.25]I got my car again.
[172:38.07]Here's another key.
[172:43.37]What's in here?
[172:45.35]Nothing.
[172:47.65]Well, let's take the dinner bell and go outside.
[172:49.48]Get rid of the dinner bell and replace it with something good.
[172:52.00]We're crying out loud.
[172:54.52]Like a giant broadsword.
[172:56.50]Like a giant broadsword.
[172:57.88]Yeah.
[173:00.22]That works.
[173:04.72]I like my setup.
[173:05.58]What do I got for ranged?
[173:06.52]A grenade, liquid nitrogen, and some nails.
[173:12.84]Put the grenade up there.
[173:14.55]Pull out the broadsword.
[173:16.75]And let's go.
[173:18.37]Let's get in my brand new car.
[173:22.30]Good joke.
[173:24.66]Well, you're gonna get some high quality jokes now because we're getting in a car.
[173:28.21]Don't you know?
[173:29.39]Car equals comedy.
[173:31.67]Car equals comedy every time.
[173:38.43]For instance, for instance, that's some comedy right there.
[173:40.77]I wanted to leave and it closed on my face.
[173:48.98]Why is it trying to tell me over here?
[173:57.11]A snowmobile?
[174:00.39]Fuck, I just got this dumb sedan.
[174:01.85]You're gonna give me a snowmobile?
[174:08.35]Shit, really?
[174:11.54]Ow.
[174:16.68]What is even here?
[174:17.38]Apparently something in here that's important, I guess.
[174:27.90]It's a giant cannon.
[174:30.72]Shield.
[174:33.48]Clothes.
[174:34.16]Newsy.
[174:35.30]No, I like a knight.
[174:37.34]What's upstairs?
[174:37.98]A bunch of random shit.
[174:48.63]Letter opener.
[174:54.01]Cold medicine.
[174:54.63]Hey!
[174:56.25]Die.
[174:56.64]Stay there.
[175:06.62]What is in these blue?
[175:07.24]Is this just a point of interest or something?
[175:08.88]Is there anything in particular that is in here that I should be looking for?
[175:17.30]There's a chest.
[175:17.78]Hey, there's a bunch of stuff in this random zone.
[175:22.29]Cough syrup.
[175:23.05]I'll just take it.
[175:23.93]Fill myself to full.
[175:24.69]You're not going to take the pirate cannon?
[175:28.31]I can't.
[175:28.69]I don't have the exoskeleton suit.
[175:31.07]It broke because I wanted to drive a car.
[175:37.50]Okay, let's... It's a thing I can open with a key I found?
[175:42.75]Really?
[175:43.01]Hmm.
[175:45.91]I wonder where that is.
[175:46.59]A lot of doors.
[175:50.23]A lot of boxes to open.
[175:54.19]Oh.
[175:58.65]Welcome to the let's open up every single draw stream.
[176:01.77]Hope it's enjoyable for you guys.
[176:13.09]That just actually scared the shit out of me.
[176:14.31]I didn't think there was a person on the stairs.
[176:15.57]Damn.
[176:18.09]Um... Star said I was funny.
[176:24.55]Well, he's a nice guy.
[176:34.64]A lot of kills.
[176:35.78]That's good.
[176:37.28]I'm having a great time.
[176:38.40]Well, that's good.
[176:41.53]Well, if you don't think I'm going to take the comedy hammer, you're crazy.
[176:44.07]It'll take one joke to go.
[176:51.00]Well, let's swap it out for the comedy hammer.
[177:03.38]See, it already is funny.
[177:04.16]It makes funny noises.
[177:09.14]Is it third floor?
[177:09.82]Is it really?
[177:10.98]Oh, God.
[177:15.32]Get up there quick.
[177:22.02]Third floor?
[177:22.84]What are you talking about?
[177:29.51]Third floor?
[177:37.03]I don't see a third floor.
[177:43.13]Joke?
[177:43.39]Did I just get joked?
[177:44.29]Somebody joked me.
[177:55.69]Quality noise, gamer.
[178:02.66]Sedan, don't forget your fucking car.
[178:08.98]Wait, but let's see which one is cooler, though.
[178:10.60]That's the problem.
[178:16.02]This thing is way cooler.
[178:20.96]Like, this thing is just so much cooler.
[178:22.90]So much faster and sleeker.
[178:24.58]The wall?
[178:25.00]What the heck are you talking about?
[178:27.02]What wall?
[178:27.36]I don't know.
[178:28.52]Should I take the sedan?
[178:52.28]Go back to the third floor.
[178:56.72]There is a third floor, but I don't think it's accessible.
[179:01.12]The stairs were behind the wall.
[179:02.94]Break the wooden wall.
[179:04.30]I hope I'm not getting ju- uh, uh, juked again.
[179:07.34]Am I getting joked again?
[179:11.83]I got fucking joked again.
[179:15.61]Alright, that's it.
[179:18.13]We're done.
[179:18.91]Get in the fucking sedan.
[179:19.87]Let's go.
[179:25.74]I got joked again.
[179:26.56]Didn't even get the car again.
[179:32.06]We got him again.
[179:40.58]We got him again.
[179:42.92]Back in the sedan.
[179:45.43]Where the Christmas music plays?
[179:50.49]Oh shit.
[179:53.33]Gonna go in the drugstore.
[179:54.11]This is a drugstore, right?
[179:55.47]Fucking get comedy hammered!
[179:59.57]Come on, do it!
[180:00.07]This thing sucks.
[180:08.15]I say that as it's being incredible.
[180:09.69]What am I talking about?
[180:10.77]Can't get in that way.
[180:17.56]Climb the truck.
[180:18.46]Definitely.
[180:19.00]Watch out for the rats that are on the hood.
[180:28.04]No, give me the mall.
[180:28.82]The mall's just better.
[180:29.96]Um... Getting to the apartment.
[180:36.37]Well, I don't think I can even... Can I, like, shimmy up there?
[180:40.57]It's probably around the backside.
[180:47.13]Into, like, the alleyway or something, right?
[180:49.83]Yeah, I would assume.
[180:53.36]Watch out!
[181:01.03]I just got hurt because I ran out of stamina.
[181:04.57]Acid Mall?
[181:05.73]I can only... Well, Acid Base?
[181:07.09]You want me to Acid Base?
[181:17.46]Yeah, let's do it.
[181:21.96]I didn't think about the sedan.
[181:22.82]I know it's right back there.
[181:32.91]So it's just a regular mace, but with annoying particle effects on it.
[181:36.48]Okay, well, that's cool, I guess.
[181:47.03]Acid face?
[181:47.71]Nah, why did I bring up acid face?
[181:51.89]Thank you, Darren, for the five dollars.
[181:53.79]You want a joke?
[181:57.86]Blueprint.
[182:04.00]Beers.
[182:07.83]Ice sword.
[182:08.19]That's kind of cool, I guess.
[182:10.89]Kind of.
[182:12.69]Cereal.
[182:19.41]Rotten food in the fridge.
[182:22.37]Somebody was keeping $1,100 in their fridge.
[182:23.61]God.
[182:23.71]Damn it.
[182:50.66]This is so... This is so shit.
[182:58.52]Like, let's be real.
[183:05.94]Oh, they have a secret Dexter's laboratory lair.
[183:10.16]What?
[183:13.31]Zombie safe public rooms.
[183:14.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[183:18.21]Each room is highly secure and requires a unique access card to open.
[183:21.91]Look for white Rook protection stickers to indicate where a panic room might be located.
[183:26.08]Alright.
[183:29.76]It's locked.
[183:33.54]Can't get in there.
[183:40.24]Well, it was inevitable to have a dumb Christmas sweater on.
[183:44.92]Wait, what?! !
[183:47.56]Third floor was the panic room.
[183:50.72]Come on, I know it wasn't.
[183:53.32]You're just gagging me again.
[183:59.10]Um... Well, we have to take pictures of stuff.
[184:05.77]Santa's sleigh...
[184:31.92]It's the blood, obviously, right?
[184:33.44]Don't I have to take a picture of the blood?
[184:35.96]What the fuck are you trying to do to me, man?
[184:38.02]Somebody puked.
[184:48.49]Okay, yeah, somebody puked.
[184:49.55]Got it.
[184:56.14]Well, there's the safe.
[184:56.96]The key for the room.
[184:59.28]Let me just go in there.
[185:11.33]Take any more pictures of the guy's bed?
[185:13.05]Oh, a clue detected somewhere.
[185:24.15]The shower.
[185:24.61]What the fuck am I taking a picture of?
[185:30.40]The boxes?
[185:30.92]Like, who cares?
[185:32.36]Someone's a shutterbug.
[185:35.10]Some kind of ritual murder.
[185:36.36]Oh, boy.
[185:52.50]So a Shatterbug means there's like a picture.
[186:01.87]Take a picture of like the World War II boat.
[186:03.41]Ooh, a gun!
[186:12.62]Gun!
[186:23.79]What the fuck am I supposed to be taking a picture of here?
[186:27.03]Like the window that you jumped out of?
[186:30.93]Oh, God.
[186:35.99]Can't quite make up a subject here.
[186:46.25]Holy shit.
[186:48.01]No zombie could have done this.
[186:50.15]I thought that was funny.
[186:51.79]Whatever they're hunting, I think it's hunting them back.
[186:54.75]Okay, I thought, honest to God, I thought that was a lamp.
[187:00.40]Sounds like they're fighting something.
[187:01.92]I wonder if I can listen in.
[187:02.80]When I was over here, right?
[187:04.24]Okay, so when I was looking this way.
[187:07.84]Let me see.
[187:08.24]Let me get it to be.
[187:08.90]See, that's a lamp.
[187:11.32]Look it.
[187:12.82]That's a lamp.
[187:22.63]Yeah, you guys wanted jokes?
[187:23.77]Got ya!
[187:30.99]You're a wizard, Jesse.
[187:33.51]Ow, shit, I'm so sorry.
[187:35.59]Yeah, got you guys.
[187:36.47]Got you with that fucking joke.
[187:40.03]You guys are waiting for a joke?
[187:43.71]You guys are trolling me?
[187:44.97]You guys are making me go up to the third floor?
[187:48.85]Well, guess what?
[187:49.53]I couldn't find that guy, could I?
[187:54.54]Hey, it's Paula.
[187:55.54]While you're out there, I need you to write down a few stories for the podcast.
[187:59.28]If I get around to it.
[188:00.81]Aye, I'm sending you what I got.
[188:02.67]Now go forth, Apostle Frank.
[188:04.45]Get the story.
[188:05.41]Find the truth.
[188:06.35]I'll call you later.
[188:10.95]God damn it.
[188:11.55]That's at least a $5 joke right there.
[188:13.59]Mr. Sneak Man, $50.
[188:15.09]Jesus, dude.
[188:17.19]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, man.
[188:19.31]And Sam with $10 as well.
[188:21.66]Tell me a heartwarming story.
[188:22.76]Alright, a heartwarming story is
[188:26.05]You know, the acid hammer got in the way.
[188:27.55]Look at this.
[188:27.99]Remember, I'm using the acid hammer and it's clouding my vision.
[188:33.73]Look at it.
[188:34.09]See?
[188:35.59]It's completely blocking it out.
[188:38.87]Look at that.
[188:39.81]You can't even see that shit.
[188:44.21]Alright, let's get me out of here.
[188:47.89]Use this and buy a new lamp.
[188:51.31]Oh, God.
[188:51.99]You guys are fucking too much.
[188:55.31]Thank you for the bits, guys.
[188:58.29]Multitrip, 10 bucks.
[188:59.77]Purple with more.
[189:00.85]Sneakman with 50 bucks.
[189:04.77]Mew.
[189:05.49]Mewkimari with 5 bucks.
[189:07.36]You guys are fucking too much.
[189:09.02]Darren gave 5 bucks too.
[189:10.72]Tenant gave 2 bucks.
[189:13.34]Jesus.
[189:18.87]Yeah, I'm gonna... I'll do the sword.
[189:22.25]I'm just going to throw this shit out the window because I don't fucking even care what it is.
[189:25.39]I'm tossing it because I have three of them.
[189:29.39]That didn't go out the fucking window.
[189:30.91]Did it?
[189:32.01]No, it didn't.
[189:32.98]It didn't go out the window as planned.
[189:38.16]Okay, it's not going to happen apparently.
[189:42.78]Because I can't throw it.
[189:43.62]You just drop it.
[189:48.20]Here we go.
[189:51.92]Come on!
[189:52.78]Fucking get in there!
[189:54.04]Get the dome down!
[190:00.15]Ah, well.
[190:01.83]Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you do it.
[190:04.75]That's how you don't get it done.
[190:05.99]Game designers' comfortable shoes.
[190:07.67]Give me the sword.
[190:15.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:17.68]Is it liquid nitrogen?
[190:21.21]Don't I have liquid nitrogen?
[190:23.13]What the fuck happened to the liquid nitrogen?
[190:29.19]I guess I don't have the liquid nitrogen anymore.
[190:33.16]Third time's the charm, I know.
[190:36.00]I'm gonna get rid of this.
[190:37.06]Let's get the fire starter.
[190:38.12]This thing's pretty good.
[190:42.98]Ah, there it is.
[190:48.29]Ice sword.
[190:57.00]I got plenty of great weapons now.
[190:58.42]Let's use the ice sword.
[191:01.23]Got the shotgun.
[191:02.19]I got a lot of powerful stuff.
[191:06.61]I'm ready.
[191:09.07]Let's get the hell out of here.
[191:15.77]Not the blambo.
[191:16.95]Fuck the blambo.
[191:20.45]Blambo is... I don't like it.
[191:21.89]It's dumb.
[191:25.00]Can't pick that up.
[191:26.62]It's gonna break my legs if I jump down here.
[191:28.14]I thought it killed me.
[191:33.86]That was actually kind of scary.
[191:36.53]Ah, no, no, no.
[191:37.25]Let's just go.
[191:39.63]Where's my sedan?
[191:45.67]There's my sedan!
[191:48.38]Holy fuck, this thing is incredible.
[191:53.60]Wow.
[191:54.98]It's too good.
[191:57.29]I thought... Did the zombie just get in the car with me?
[192:00.35]Didn't that look like a zombie got in the front seat?
[192:06.41]Event nearby.
[192:07.11]They always throw these dumb events.
[192:08.35]I don't want to do them, but fine.
[192:09.57]We'll do it.
[192:24.62]Hey, we got our suit back!
[192:28.92]Look what we get!
[192:36.47]Power suit!
[192:44.79]Get in it!
[192:51.04]Now this time, don't get in a car.
[192:55.22]Do not get in a vehicle.
[193:06.19]Pick up this thing.
[193:07.51]Get the two weapons.
[193:08.39]And let's get on out of here.
[193:12.75]Let's go.
[193:16.10]What is this?
[193:19.28]Is this another event?
[193:23.67]Okay, I almost just did something really bad.
[193:26.47]Oh, you want an exosuit fight, buddy?
[193:32.94]Well, aren't you just a stupid idiot?
[193:54.53]Am I suplexing this guy?
[194:10.86]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[194:12.56]YB, YB, YB, YB!
[194:14.48]Suplex him!
[194:17.20]I can't suplex that guy.
[194:32.36]That does not fucking hurt this guy at all.
[194:34.35]Like, wow.
[194:35.61]That's unbelievable.
[194:36.39]That is no damage.
[194:38.81]What?
[195:08.42]Why did I die?
[195:19.05]Shouldn't I have, like, popped out of the suit?
[195:20.49]I thought I was going to pop out of the suit.
[195:21.63]There was a suit in there.
[195:25.67]Yeah, I ran out of power.
[195:26.53]That doesn't mean I die.
[195:27.53]Well, whatever.
[195:28.11]We're right here.
[195:37.13]I got the suit back, don't worry.
[195:39.29]This time, I'm going to shoot the guy in the back.
[195:41.07]Alright, let's do it.
[195:54.62]I know why I died, because of the flamethrower, but I didn't expect that when the power suit was at zero power, you instantly die.
[196:03.63]And it looks like I popped out and I'm in the fire and the fire instantly killed me.
[196:06.65]Those are the Super Mario Brothers?
[196:08.09]This power just drains, doesn't it, huh?
[196:37.67]Investigate the rumors.
[196:38.65]What is this?
[196:39.03]Is that the same thing I just did?
[196:47.90]That would suck to see me, like, right now, wouldn't it?
[196:54.42]Ooh!
[196:55.70]Funny little ride!
[196:56.52]I can ride the kitty ride!
[197:09.26]This is so stupid.
[197:14.35]Okay, that was fun.
[197:15.25]Get out.
[197:21.77]Go get the cannon?
[197:26.68]Cannon was in like the medieval store, right?
[197:33.68]Yeah, thank god it doesn't break in the kitty car.
[197:35.18]I would have been very upset.
[197:41.21]This thing's just gonna break.
[197:44.29]Like... Investigate the room, like, what the fuck?
[198:00.24]You don't get this thing for very long, huh?
[198:06.67]Well, I guess... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[198:08.17]Give me this!
[198:10.05]I got the parking meter now, sick!
[198:11.74]Alright, use it!
[198:31.45]I destroyed the equipment.
[198:33.53]Maybe I should check that out.
[198:45.92]Is there another one in there?
[198:48.36]That guy just disintegrated.
[198:56.79]This gun is incredible, by the way.
[198:58.73]What a gun.
[199:00.01]What a weapon.
[199:04.77]Oh, papa.
[199:12.64]Nothing else of value, I don't think.
[199:20.13]Couldn't throw a grenade in this room.
[199:24.67]Alright, what have I got?
[199:26.01]First aid, just heal up.
[199:32.52]I thought that was just my naked ass.
[199:34.36]I thought that was just my butt cheeks.
[199:38.30]Beer.
[199:40.56]Alright.
[199:42.44]I like the ice sword the best, I think.
[199:48.98]Sledgehammer?
[199:49.62]No, fuck it.
[199:50.30]Let's go with handgun.
[199:54.85]Flash grenade.
[199:55.93]What is that?
[199:57.77]Cell phone?
[199:58.43]It's just more lore shit.
[200:00.97]Let's just go to the firehouse.
[200:07.51]Pretty sick.
[200:08.05]Damn it.
[200:12.25]Damn it.
[200:16.27]Take a look what's on that counter.
[200:17.34]This is like the giant cannon.
[200:24.04]Discover what happened.
[200:26.22]And by discover what happened, I mean take a bunch of pictures of stuff while you stand still.
[200:33.24]Machine gun.
[200:33.79]No, I'll keep the ice sword.
[200:42.45]Snowman mask.
[200:43.31]Yeah.
[200:46.94]I need to take more pictures.
[200:47.74]I gotta take, like, selfies and shit.
[200:51.70]Holy terror.
[200:53.66]Computer plus what?
[200:54.66]I don't think that's computer.
[201:04.84]There's an assault rifle there, though.
[201:15.99]I don't think I even want it.
[201:22.76]Ah, let me guess.
[201:23.60]Take out your camera.
[201:28.36]Well, there goes the helmet.
[201:29.50]Now I have a goalie mask on.
[201:36.12]Do the thing.
[201:37.10]Do that thing that you do.
[201:38.18]Alright, I'll do the thing.
[201:40.08]Ooh, it's an exosuit.
[201:44.73]For free.
[201:55.90]Well, now what?
[201:59.18]Go down the fireman pole?
[202:03.84]I guess so.
[202:04.62]Come on, give me some shit.
[202:10.37]Give me some shit to do with this thing.
[202:22.10]I don't see anything.
[202:25.20]So I'm just gonna beat the shit out of people who are locked in here.
[202:30.40]Camera, I wish you would be in the right spot!
[202:38.98]Dead?
[202:44.05]Who's left?
[202:46.63]Alright, this was supposed to be a fallback point for Obscurus, so who brought all the zombies?
[202:52.21]Or what?
[202:54.90]No, I have a power suit!
[202:57.78]I have a power suit on!
[202:58.87]Don't put me in this... I don't want to take pictures, I have a fucking power suit!
[203:05.17]Ugh... Alright, my power suit's gonna break off now because I have to take pictures of the firetruck.
[203:18.04]My Instagram.
[203:22.68]Leaves their stuff everywhere.
[203:25.14]Like a fly caught in the web.
[203:26.85]Okay.
[203:31.65]Well.
[203:34.75]Look, a guy!
[203:36.99]Is that a lamp?
[203:37.79]Oh shit, cool lamp!
[203:42.16]Something ate his face skin off and hung him here.
[203:44.42]Hold on.
[203:50.02]That's not right.
[203:52.99]What's making that horrible noise?
[203:56.49]What the fuck?
[203:58.39]Oh, it's... Okay, that scared the shit out of me.
[204:09.04]Alright, I get it.
[204:09.68]I know what happened.
[204:10.48]I understand.
[204:11.10]LMG.
[204:11.46]Yeah, I'll... I'll swap the LMG with, uh, nothing.
[204:15.40]Because I have two good stuff.
[204:18.70]Get the computer.
[204:21.88]Well, let me, like, obscurials leave their stuff everywhere.
[204:24.84]This is so fun.
[204:32.64]No, that was just a coin.
[204:37.12]Alright, I... I'm, uh... It's gone too far.
[204:43.89]To a point where... I'm saying obscurial and I'm looking for, like, Harry Potter magic.
[204:53.48]I'm looking on the ground for, like, goo.
[204:55.04]Like, I'm looking for magic shit.
[204:57.18]Because the word Obscurus.
[205:00.14]It is buried into my brain now.
[205:01.68]Uh, well, yeah.
[205:07.95]We're taking the fireman's outfit.
[205:11.33]Oh, now we're gonna be fireman guy.
[205:15.13]It does.
[205:18.91]Really fat.
[205:26.52]Not bad!
[205:32.92]Ooh, a ball bat.
[205:40.20]And we're in there.
[205:43.04]Search.
[205:43.50]1400?
[205:50.15]Obscurus leaves their stuff everywhere.
[205:52.73]Where's the stuff?
[205:53.85]Looking for stuff.
[205:54.63]It's gotta be like those boxes, right?
[205:57.94]And there are like obscurus boxes somewhere over here.
[206:04.54]Boxes.
[206:05.02]Come on, that's like obscurus' stuff, right?
[206:08.51]Apparently that's not obscurus' stuff.
[206:17.05]Maybe it's like upstairs somewhere.
[206:18.53]Oh, a computer!
[206:28.00]Get me out of this mode.
[206:31.44]Computer and... What is it?
[206:33.48]Oh, come on.
[206:37.12]Computer and... Well, we're going to make the Holy Terror.
[206:41.58]Um... Let me just catch up on some stuff here.
[206:58.45]Yeah, sorry, the reason why I'm missing so many subs and bit notifications is because I usually can hear my computer audio, but because I have it plugged into this monitor,
[207:12.27]I have my headphone plugged into this monitor.
[207:15.61]So I can't hear the notifications.
[207:18.05]Because I don't want speakers to play out and, you know, you'll hear it like twice, essentially.
[207:24.02]So I apologize for that.
[207:26.26]But, uh, thank you for the bits to... Mr. Sneakman, I think, gave another 10 bucks.
[207:33.99]Sam gave 5 bucks.
[207:37.39]Thanks, guys.
[207:37.99]Thanks.
[207:40.22]And they say, what do they say?
[207:41.46]It's a thanks for the joke.
[207:44.46]That's what I'm here for.
[207:47.97]Uh, CS Slipball23, thanks for the three months.
[207:51.35]Callisto Lancer, thanks for two months.
[207:54.31]Long time fan.
[207:55.33]I've been enjoying your stream since your new schedule.
[207:57.73]Cheers.
[207:57.99]Well, thanks, man.
[207:59.09]Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying the stream.
[208:01.61]Let's Get Fappy already got you, but never tan for three months.
[208:03.84]Will you come to my birthday party if I arrange a clown car pickup?
[208:06.18]Yes.
[208:06.26]Yes.
[208:09.25]It has to be a clown car, though.
[208:10.65]I am not showing up.
[208:12.53]Guaranteed.
[208:13.03]Alright, so what is this Holy Trinity thing?
[208:16.60]What is it called?
[208:17.08]Alright, this thing looks weird.
[208:22.12]Alright, investigate this stuff.
[208:23.28]I'm just... Where's the easy mode button?
[208:27.02]To, like, just skip this dumb shit that I don't want to do in this game.
[208:32.83]Open.
[208:33.47]Please tell me it's not... Is it in here?
[208:35.33]Give me a break.
[208:40.76]Holy cooly.
[208:41.14]Holy cooly.
[208:41.38]Let's go to the junkyard.
[208:42.19]Can I climb up this?
[208:43.19]I don't think so.
[208:44.47]Get me out of here.
[208:45.11]Oh, my goodness.
[209:12.97]Be nice if you didn't run into every wall on the way there.
[209:16.67]Drop the ice sword?
[209:17.53]I got it.
[209:20.01]I got the ice sword.
[209:32.57]Just saw Rogue One.
[209:33.37]I actually saw Rogue One, too.
[209:34.65]And I gotta say... If that movie did not have the title Star Wars...
[209:44.88]and didn't have, like, the Star Wars characters that you all know and love, that could have been a random action movie.
[210:02.73]Go to the junkyard.
[210:07.77]Oh, gas station.
[210:08.97]Here's your hundred dollar joke.
[210:10.83]Gas station, gas station.
[210:12.79]You know what that means.
[210:17.15]That was severely disappointing.
[210:24.04]The whole thing was supposed to blow up.
[210:25.32]Are you shitting me?
[210:28.37]Nice gas station.
[210:30.59]Give me the little baby toy car and let's get out of here.
[210:47.96]No, put that away.
[210:49.00]Put that away.
[210:49.72]Put that away.
[210:51.22]Maybe I should take a seat.
[210:57.17]Oh, loot the supply crate.
[210:59.23]Sure.
[211:00.73]Thanks for the car.
[211:01.59]You really should be more careful.
[211:07.34]What am I doing?
[211:08.12]What are you doing?
[211:12.44]Get up there and shoot.
[211:18.39]Shoot the gun!
[211:19.23]I can't even turn it around.
[211:22.57]I can't turn it around.
[211:24.31]I'm pretty much just hanging out in here.
[211:31.83]Of course, of course it's fucking on fire.
[211:34.97]Get out of the way you fucking idiots!
[211:39.23]Get away from that thing!
[211:43.00]Hey, it's alright.
[211:43.59]There's an exoskeleton bug millennium boy in here.
[211:45.67]Don't worry, everybody.
[211:48.01]He just hit me in the face.
[211:50.25]Hey, don't worry, everybody.
[211:52.64]There's an exoskeleton bug millennium boy in here.
[211:59.42]Ooh, minigun, minigun.
[212:02.35]Matilda Axe.
[212:16.03]Boss fight.
[212:16.47]Give me a boss fight.
[212:17.61]I'll take care of it right now.
[212:25.62]Investigate the room.
[212:26.32]Why is it still there?
[212:27.98]No.
[212:29.56]No.
[212:33.79]I don't give a fuck about any of this.
[212:40.22]Do you see the timer down here on the lower left, lady?
[212:50.46]Alright.
[212:54.88]Infiltrate the junkyard.
[212:56.30]Thanks.
[212:59.85]Precious time was just completely wasted.
[213:03.87]Crouch?
[213:04.09]What are you talking about?
[213:04.69]I have an exo-fucking-skeleton-bug-bloody-in-body.
[213:10.73]Who's next?
[213:15.55]Got him!
[213:17.94]Precious time!
[213:18.60]Precious time!
[213:19.10]Go, go, go!
[213:22.22]Precious time!
[213:37.93]Here we go.
[213:38.31]I wish I didn't have to talk to that stupid lady for fucking three minutes.
[213:43.19]It's gonna- Yeah, I'm just gonna wait.
[213:45.29]This is dumb.
[213:45.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[213:49.38]Just wait till I get my fucking pulse rifle.
[213:53.34]Wait till the fireman shows up.
[213:54.66]Wait till- Hey, here comes- Here comes the cleaner!
[214:09.60]Get cleaned up.
[214:19.95]I just, I want, I want the first save kit game.
[214:23.97]Game.
[214:29.13]Classic phrase.
[214:32.16]Alright, boys and girls.
[214:34.66]Ready for the cleaning duty.
[214:42.49]Idiot.
[214:42.79]Huh.
[214:50.22]What's that?
[214:51.08]Something stinks.
[214:52.74]Smells like shit.
[214:54.80]Clean it up!
[215:09.33]What's in here?
[215:12.05]Blocked.
[215:16.07]Alright.
[215:20.70]Gotta find the way in.
[215:22.02]Off the back of the horse.
[215:23.00]Go on the back of the horse and jump off.
[215:25.64]No.
[215:25.86]What about over there?
[215:26.40]Nope.
[215:29.50]Can't even... Wait.
[215:32.18]Somebody is coming over here.
[215:33.23]Hey, watch my six.
[215:45.75]Am I gonna play Turtle Ball 2?
[215:46.99]Titanfall 2?
[215:48.91]Um... I just went right through his body.
[215:56.47]Uh, probably not.
[216:00.73]Probably not.
[216:03.28]Exciting locked door game.
[216:08.18]This gun is so good, though.
[216:09.84]What a great gun.
[216:12.38]Just... It's like 6 out of 10, you know what I mean?
[216:17.76]I'm going to do a little bit of Call of Duty.
[216:19.04]I learned this in my Call of Duty days.
[216:22.49]That they're on, like, fucking point B. They're going!
[216:33.33]Clear.
[216:36.58]Super health kit.
[216:40.66]Okay, there's nothing really even in here.
[216:45.82]Six skill points out of ten.
[216:52.60]That was good.
[217:03.60]That was very, very good.
[217:05.90]That was really good.
[217:10.22]I like that.
[217:17.02]You can zoom in with R. Okay, I guess.
[217:26.97]Survival.
[217:27.47]Here we go.
[217:29.41]Melee slot.
[217:30.41]Thank you.
[217:37.39]Fortitude.
[217:37.99]Let's see what else I can do in here now.
[217:40.70]More health or reduce the amount of damage taken from melee attacks.
[217:43.30]You know, that's probably a good thing.
[217:46.70]What's this one?
[217:47.94]Total stamina.
[217:48.67]Yeah, we'll do that.
[217:49.47]I'm gonna do that twice, actually.
[217:53.79]And we'll do that as well.
[218:02.47]Might as well.
[218:03.85]Uh, no, I don't have any points left.
[218:07.63]You don't use pistols?
[218:10.43]I'm doing it for the future, man.
[218:11.89]I gotta, like, be ready for pistols.
[218:13.13]What do you mean I don't use pistols?
[218:14.82]Look it, I got...
[218:17.23]No pistols.
[218:18.79]Not one equipped on me right now, but it's for the future.
[218:21.27]It's to make sure I'm, like, rounded out.
[218:23.37]Look, when I get the magnum, like, the good magnum, damn, it's gonna be fucking awesome.
[218:29.71]Well, I didn't expect to get, like, the fucking proton pack.
[218:33.91]Oh, hi, Star.
[218:36.12]Copy that.
[218:36.58]We'll be there shortly.
[218:38.56]Let's go.
[218:39.58]Because who gives a shit about this game's stupid storyline?
[218:44.10]Thank you, TwitchyDove, for the ten months.

[219:21.08]There's your $20 joke Mr. West
[219:34.31]Oh, and you can't throw things in this game, Star.
[219:37.17]Star, there is no throwing things.
[219:38.61]You cannot throw.
[219:41.01]Unless it's a... Hold on, there's a fucking boss here.
[219:43.89]Time to bring in the... Hey, I'm a firefighter.
[219:50.51]Yeah, time to bring in the fucking fire cleaner.
[219:52.56]Hey now, come on.
[219:55.22]Let's just sit down and talk about this, alright?
[220:05.23]It sucks to be you, doesn't it?
[220:10.29]You can't block this, man.
[220:13.85]Yeah, you gotta walk right to the fuel tank.
[220:15.51]What a dummy.
[220:22.10]What a fucking dummy, you know what I mean?
[220:25.32]Come over to this one, too.
[220:26.80]Come over here, you Metal Gear Solid boss.
[220:28.48]Didn't you do this in, like, a Metal Gear Solid game?
[220:31.06]Made him, like, walk over to stuff.
[220:34.45]Like, explosive things.
[220:35.47]No, he's just... he's a total moron.
[220:48.28]Please hit him one time!
[220:49.96]Nope.
[220:50.80]We're gonna make a cleaning... Throw in the cleaner joke!
[220:53.94]Kaboom!
[220:58.54]Hey!
[220:59.56]Somebody needs a cleaner!
[221:00.86]Kaboom!
[221:05.92]What?
[221:06.22]What does he want me to do?
[221:08.56]Oh, shh.
[221:09.40]Come on.
[221:10.72]Fuck.
[221:11.02]He wanted me to take a picture of him.
[221:16.28]Oh, well.
[221:33.36]Those bastards took Darcy.
[221:35.10]You see which way they went?
[221:36.34]Westridge, I think.
[221:38.44]You're going after them, right?
[221:40.02]You'll save Darcy?
[221:41.64]Uh, probably, but not on purpose.
[221:45.56]Okay.
[221:45.78]I'll see if I can figure out where they were going.
[221:48.29]Thank you, Daselka, for the sub.
[221:50.35]And based stick for two months.
[221:52.65]1920 salesman, thanks for the bits.
[221:55.41]You are everyone when they are high?
[221:57.65]What?
[222:00.75]But I'm not high, though.
[222:05.15]Go to Westeros.
[222:06.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:08.29]I'm high on life, man.
[222:10.63]I can please kill her.
[222:18.80]Mmm, chemicals?
[222:20.88]Can I make anything with these chemicals?
[222:24.33]Still have not used that.
[222:26.41]I'm glad I made it.
[222:28.03]I don't have anything.
[222:29.83]I've had those boxes of nails for like three hours now.
[222:38.29]Am I ever going to use them?
[222:39.44]Who will ever know?
[222:40.24]No, actually, I'm going to expend this last shot right here.
[222:44.54]Just so you can see how cool that gun was.
[222:47.14]And now I'm going to go get the assault rifle that was, what, over here?
[222:52.88]Right here.
[223:03.01]Open.
[223:06.07]Say hello to my little friend.
[223:07.17]Alright, I'm getting tired of the Junior League News Club.
[223:10.55]I need to focus on what's going on here.
[223:13.99]Just get me in the giant crane.
[223:15.57]Get me in the snowplow.
[223:17.68]Oh boy, I get to be in a snowplow.
[223:20.10]Get out of the road!
[223:28.02]Fireman and the Snowplow.
[223:29.48]It all makes perfect sense from here on out.
[223:34.98]Do you see how far away I have to go?
[223:36.36]I have to go 1,000 minutes away.
[223:39.20]How do I see the map?
[223:41.76]I don't even know.
[223:42.16]I'm going the right fucking way.
[223:43.77]What is my life right now?
[223:46.19]Where's the map?
[223:47.97]Okay, I need to go straight all the way down through Old Town to West Ridge.
[223:56.71]This is a fairly large map, actually.
[223:59.59]Alright, let's go this way.
[224:00.63]Just straight down the road.
[224:01.55]Just follow the road.
[224:03.33]Drive the snowplow all the way down here.
[224:10.75]Did they change his voice actor?
[224:12.37]This doesn't even look or sound like Frank West.
[224:15.86]Hey, Brad.
[224:17.04]Obscurus is hunting something.
[224:18.98]I honestly think it's some kind of horrible zombie monster.
[224:23.03]I don't even want to care.
[224:25.37]There's a survivor in there.
[224:28.12]You guys know how to do this.
[224:29.32]It's easy.
[224:29.72]Snowplow people.
[224:30.90]Can't take that word seriously.
[224:32.84]Need some acid base.
[224:36.56]There's a guy in there.
[224:37.48]Hold on.
[224:37.92]Can I... What happens?
[224:53.25]I need to know this for scientific research.
[224:58.05]Hold on.
[225:01.79]This is gonna take forever, by the way.
[225:03.23]They're gonna keep aggroing.
[225:19.53]Just don't aggro anymore.
[225:21.43]Just gotta get clean headshots on everybody.
[225:25.37]You fucking stupid asshole.
[225:27.07]See, this is what I'm talking about.
[225:28.03]This is the shit I was just talking about.
[225:30.98]Can I just open the fucking door?
[225:32.22]How is it locked?
[225:35.70]What a real... You know what?
[225:37.28]Just take out the fucking sword.
[225:39.16]What am I doing?
[225:39.64]I did not want to do that!
[225:41.34]You know what?
[225:41.72]I did.
[225:44.10]I did want to do that.
[225:45.48]I did want to do that.
[225:46.83]I did want to do that.
[225:51.87]I love how he's just cheering me on.
[225:53.05]What are more of these stupid things that I gotta kill?
[226:09.56]Will you open the door now?
[226:10.50]Yeah, they're dead.
[226:15.36]They're dead!
[226:27.46]Why, game?
[226:29.32]Why?
[226:29.86]There's clearly nobody alive here.
[226:35.26]What, is this a random guy that's iced?
[226:40.47]Fucking trying my patience.
[226:41.77]This random guy that's iced is not dead.
[226:45.03]Where?
[226:46.79]Where?
[226:48.17]Where?
[226:48.37]I don't... Where is this guy?
[226:52.69]Oh my fucking god.
[226:56.57]Well, why was it telling me the skull- why was it- the fucking skulls were still there?
[226:59.79]Because the skulls mean you have to kill these things before the door opens.
[227:05.81]You can't fault me on that one.
[227:07.07]This is just bugged out shit dumb bug.
[227:11.19]Did he just get in that car?
[227:18.26]He didn't get in the car.
[227:26.38]Hey, you can't fault me on that one.
[227:28.90]Every other instance I've been like, I was just tunnel vision trying to get rid of the skulls.
[227:36.27]What'd you leave in here?
[227:36.97]Did you like shit in a box in here?
[227:41.57]I'm gonna pick up the flame sword.
[227:43.07]Everybody calm down.
[227:44.71]I'm gonna pick up the flame sword.
[227:46.31]I promise.
[227:55.30]Alright, what do we got?
[228:06.55]Fog, fog, fog, fog.
[228:09.45]These shit's money.
[228:14.20]Interesting.
[228:18.80]Backseat, backseat, backseat, you suck.
[228:23.70]Just listen to the Christmas music.
[228:24.84]You'll all feel better.
[228:25.54]I don't care about the event.
[228:28.38]I'm done.
[228:29.82]Whoever's stuck in their fucking dumb giant cage could just die there.
[228:33.40]I don't care.
[228:33.84]We have a mission to do.
[228:35.48]Are the skulls going to be there forever?
[228:42.88]Probably.
[228:48.46]Now come smooth jazz.
[228:55.94]this is I'm gonna go left and then I gotta get back on the road
[229:15.10]This is not a way I should be going.
[229:17.04]No, that's a wall.
[229:18.42]That's a wall.
[229:19.39]Alright.
[229:20.13]Just wanted to be sure.
[229:22.91]Just wanted to be sure.
[229:24.07]Don't go over the edge.
[229:27.05]Just wanted to be sure that you could possibly, you know, go that way.
[229:31.09]Am I going the right way now?
[229:33.11]I am.
[229:40.79]Straight this way.
[229:46.03]Oh yeah, eat shit!
[229:49.51]Yeah, eat shit.
[229:50.11]200, 190.
[229:50.15]This thing's really chugging right now.
[229:57.16]Come on, just get up the hill.
[230:16.77]Get up the hill!
[230:19.43]Get out!
[230:20.82]Get out!
[230:24.76]Stop pushing people and dive!
[230:29.22]It's alright, there's a snowplow here.
[230:30.38]We're good.
[230:37.77]That better buff out!
[230:43.03]Well, I made it.
[230:54.36]Close the door as you get out.
[230:56.16]You gotta have manners.
[230:56.90]Alright.
[231:07.40]Ah, bullshit.
[231:07.90]I clearly jumped off the back of that truck.
[231:09.32]Unbelievable.
[231:09.88]Shit.
[231:15.37]Thank you Primrose the Great for 12 months.
[231:26.09]Full year.
[231:26.85]Thank you, dude.
[231:33.18]Thank you Manumation's 1920 salesman Mr. Sneakman and Danger Illustrated again for the bits.
[231:39.58]Good old 100 bits.
[231:44.07]So what, I wake up and I have to escape from the cell that they put me in, right?
[231:48.39]They're gonna take pictures of me?
[232:01.72]Shit, it's Albert Wesker.
[232:03.36]Oh, yes.
[232:06.02]What's your business here?
[232:07.30]It's me, Wesker.
[232:08.60]What in hell are you doing here, boy?
[232:09.68]I have a beard now, though.
[232:10.50]What the hell are you talking about?
[232:11.90]What am I doing here?
[232:12.91]Seven minutes.
[232:13.79]Pig-smelling idiots drugging me.
[232:15.21]Oh, smells like pigs in here?
[232:16.23]Get the fucking cleaner.
[232:17.05]Alright, that's moving on from that one.
[232:20.45]Yes, I work for National Geographic.
[232:22.33]They sent me up here to shoot the local indigenous vermin.
[232:25.37]Oh, look, I found you all.
[232:30.48]Great.
[232:31.86]Two.
[232:33.22]Which?
[232:33.84]What?
[232:34.84]They send us two goddamn reporters.
[232:36.92]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
[232:39.36]Vic?
[232:39.80]Is Vic here?
[232:40.28]Is she with you?
[232:43.27]Not really, but I'm kind of her professor.
[232:46.95]So you got pull with her?
[232:49.21]Theoretically, yes.
[232:53.11]We ain't nothing but good, honest people here.
[232:55.96]Before this, I was a rancher.
[232:57.23]I mean, plumber, auction caller, a butcher.
[233:01.42]Now we're soldiers.
[233:02.60]Frank, world ain't the same place.
[233:07.11]You want to stay in Willamette?
[233:08.83]You want to take your pictures?
[233:10.85]You're going to have to be a soldier too.
[233:13.02]My soldier.
[233:14.50]This Vic bitch?
[233:17.30]I took her in.
[233:18.78]Shared our supplies with her.
[233:20.80]Then she wasn't nothing but questions.
[233:22.62]All about our raids on these military assholes.
[233:25.52]What?
[233:26.06]Where?
[233:26.70]How many weapons we got?
[233:30.02]I thought she wanted in.
[233:31.04]I thought she wanted in.
[233:33.58]Now...
[233:34.66]And my raiders are out there pinned down in a goddamn ambush because they knew that we was coming.
[233:39.17]Okay, okay.
[233:39.85]I get the problem.
[233:42.55]I can deal with it, right?
[233:44.91]Thank God.
[233:45.39]You know why I don't have a face cam?
[233:46.93]Because of fucking situations like this.
[233:50.23]It just showed us the close-up of the fire helmet on.
[233:52.29]He looked like a fucking idiot.
[233:53.90]No, listen to me.
[233:55.06]These people are up to something, okay?
[233:56.60]I need to find out what it is.
[233:59.86]Well... This guy does look like a Sims 2 character.
[234:03.04]Anyone who might
[234:06.94]Hey, go back to being a default male from The Sims, you fucking dickhead.
[234:11.45]Listen, I'm your best option, okay?
[234:17.35]Let me go and deal with this.
[234:18.85]That's so gross.
[234:21.19]Sorry, Sneak Man, I'm disgusting.
[234:22.91]I wonder.
[234:28.34]Yeah, let's.
[234:29.96]Let's.
[234:32.00]I can't wait to take a picture of this guy's face.
[234:35.70]You're one of mine now.
[234:39.78]Give him the details.
[234:41.12]Alright.
[234:50.04]Where is he?
[234:51.16]Well, this is... Oh, boy.
[234:54.93]Oh, boy.
[234:59.45]Come on, West.
[235:00.27]Let's go.
[235:01.37]We gotta help our people.
[235:08.75]Alright.
[235:10.43]I just gotta rank C. That's like the highest fucking picture I've taken because of this.
[235:17.62]He's not happy.
[235:21.70]He's like... He's like leaning in.
[235:28.46]What are you doing?
[235:32.92]Are you shitting me?
[235:34.68]He actually like wanted to do that, didn't he?
[235:39.21]Wow.
[235:41.13]Fucking sicko.
[235:45.92]He did the thing that... Okay, when you go out with your buddies... Like somebody has a camera and you lean your fucking face in with that stern look on your face.
[235:56.98]You get over the shoulder.
[235:57.78]That was perfect.
[235:58.48]Alright, I have all this stuff.
[236:03.09]I don't need any of these things.
[236:04.17]Unless there's a blueprint here.
[236:10.33]Newspaper.
[236:11.36]What?
[236:14.08]It's obviously going to teach me a new blueprint.
[236:15.70]Bon bomb.
[236:17.48]Holiday cracker plus an explosive.
[236:20.00]Okay.
[236:22.06]Well, let's make a bon bomb.
[236:31.65]Okay.
[236:33.21]There's five of these.
[236:35.84]It's a melee weapon?
[236:36.80]How is that a melee weapon?
[236:42.53]Uh, chain, cement saw... Ah, let's just... I really don't want to replace anything, but... Oh, is this thing cool?
[236:52.79]Kind of.
[236:57.84]How long am I going to be streaming?
[236:58.78]Uh, I don't know, maybe like another hour.
[237:01.92]Go till like midnight eastern.
[237:05.32]Please play an ad so I can support you.
[237:07.38]This is an ad-free channel.
[237:10.20]I do not play ads.
[237:11.10]I never show ads on this channel.
[237:13.25]The only ad that you'll get on this channel is if you load the channel sometimes, I guess.
[237:19.93]But I do not play mid-stream ads ever.
[237:25.71]Alright.
[237:27.19]Alright.
[237:28.53]What's the story?
[237:29.57]Compared to the other Dead Rising games, how do I think this one holds up?
[237:31.79]Um...
[237:35.17]I don't get it.
[237:36.25]Why are you guys poking that particular badger?
[237:38.44]I don't know.
[237:39.00]This isn't even like a Dead Rising game.
[237:41.56]It's like weird.
[237:43.18]This is a fun kill zombie simulator.
[237:49.70]But I feel like they took out a lot of the things that made Dead Rising like a Dead Rising game.
[237:56.46]This is like a... I don't know.
[237:57.70]Three was alright.
[237:59.40]Three wasn't like...
[238:05.28]No, it's... I mean, obviously, the first two games were... You know, good.
[238:13.87]Not that this game is not good.
[238:16.27]Simulator joke, yeah, I know.
[238:22.08]I mean, like, the timer, like, I don't know.
[238:24.36]I feel like there's just no...
[238:27.21]The survivors, too?
[238:28.71]Weren't the survivors much more interesting in the other games?
[238:32.17]I distinctly remember, um... The people you run into were, like, crazy people, and they were, like, all kinds of weird things and weird shit going on.
[238:41.08]All, like, the random survivors I've run into so far are just like, Help!
[238:44.82]I'm standing on a kiosk!
[238:49.18]Thank you!
[238:49.76]No one's really been interesting.
[238:55.54]But I mean, it was kind of like that in the other games too, but not to that extent, I don't think.
[238:59.16]Alright, let's just go.
[239:07.41]Hey, couldn't you kill, like, anybody in the old Dead Rising games?
[239:14.88]It feels like they just made a... Like, just fucking have fun killing people playground.
[239:26.46]How do I get out of here?
[239:29.07]I'm gonna go right.
[239:29.87]I just fucked up their car.
[239:43.52]Oh, uh, whoops.
[239:47.54]Come on.
[239:48.74]Come on, game.
[239:49.34]Let me have this.
[239:50.94]Let me fucking kill Otis.
[239:52.14]Fuck.
[239:52.60]It's Dynasty Warriors with zombies.
[239:55.24]It is.
[239:56.50]Is that guy mad at me for doing that?
[240:00.58]What?
[240:19.96]Plus, the biggest offender, the hugest offender for me is you can't throw things.
[240:27.83]I want to throw the computer.
[240:32.43]I don't care about the shelter.
[240:36.78]I just want to go to find Hammond.
[240:38.82]Just get this part of the game over with.
[240:48.31]Sounds like someone fired the first shot.
[240:50.78]Hang on, engineer.
[240:51.36]There's not a way to get out of that.
[240:53.06]Wait, what?
[240:55.42]She's getting lit up?
[240:58.68]How long can she hold out?
[241:00.14]Get her.
[241:02.42]Hold on, get my camera.
[241:07.86]Conspiracy?
[241:08.63]I need a better angle.
[241:14.93]That's not a good angle, hold on.
[241:24.70]Wait.
[241:25.18]I just wanna get on top of it.
[241:34.69]I just wanna get up here!
[241:36.47]I'll save you, don't worry.
[241:42.57]Get on there.
[241:43.41]You can't jump up on the tractor.
[241:44.87]What kind of game is this?
[241:45.89]Dead Rising 2, you could!
[241:49.36]Okay, she's getting very quietly.
[241:56.98]Okay.
[241:58.11]This is just kind of sad at this point.
[242:02.75]They're shooting her so much that she's swimming in the gate.
[242:12.22]Alright, I think we've had enough of this.
[242:13.36]I'll go get her.
[242:13.84]I thought that was a guy.
[242:26.23]I thought that was a guy.
[242:27.65]I really thought that was another guy.
[242:29.79]How do I get in there?
[242:30.45]I've got to stop them from shooting her.
[242:35.54]Don't worry.
[242:36.68]Don't worry, dear.
[242:37.44]Help is on the way!
[242:51.04]You can choke him.
[242:59.46]Choked him.
[243:03.50]Okay.
[243:04.94]Well, that was... interesting.
[243:10.89]Saved you.
[243:11.25]Only at 50% HP.
[243:13.37]Wow.
[243:17.72]Only 50% HBA.
[243:19.57]You have like 400,000 health.
[243:26.95]Is that rocket launcher a toy?
[243:30.09]Wait, hold on.
[243:30.93]There might be some shit in here.
[243:32.58]I know I have to follow her, but she can take 10,000 bullets.
[243:35.76]I'm sure she'll be fine.
[243:36.58]Anything in here?
[243:44.47]Come on.
[243:45.11]Secret behind the... No.
[243:50.02]No secrets.
[243:51.28]Oh well.
[243:53.88]Clear out the shelter.
[243:54.73]No, I'm busy.
[243:56.67]Can you tell I'm busy?
[243:59.91]Is she losing health?
[244:00.79]I can't tell if she's losing health or what.
[244:03.63]Defend Obscurus.
[244:04.51]Defend them now.
[244:06.41]It's not a magical power.
[244:07.43]Stop thinking it is.
[244:26.09]Oh shit, now she has a health bar.
[244:27.29]Of course, now she has a health bar.
[244:28.51]Great.
[244:30.45]Please move the thumbstick down.
[244:31.57]Oh my god, I'm kicked out.
[244:32.56]Oh my fucking god.
[244:36.02]Console gaming.
[244:38.06]It's the fucking future.
[244:45.30]Seriously, I'm very clearly aiming.
[244:48.14]Like, now my camera's changing to the other shoulder.
[244:57.19]Fucking controller aim.
[245:04.13]Oh, there's a handgun!
[245:05.29]Look at that.
[245:06.17]Look at how good this handgun is now.
[245:09.93]You guys didn't think I'd ever find a handgun.
[245:11.13]Well, I did.
[245:11.51]Uh-oh.
[245:14.77]I have to fight one of those big guys.
[245:15.89]Wait, we gotta pre-fire.
[245:20.89]Wrong fucking way, and he's coming in with the axe hot.
[245:26.23]Where's my suit?
[245:30.37]Thank God he's a moron.
[245:32.91]What a moron.
[245:33.59]No, no, no!
[245:46.44]Ah!
[245:54.55]Holy shit, that was so stupid.
[246:02.07]Jesse.
[246:04.17]Thank you, Mr. Sneak Man, for the $4.
[246:06.26]Appreciate it, man.
[246:08.20]Water isn't wet, thanks for the bits.
[246:09.44]Antigen pee, thanks for the $150.
[246:13.12]And thank you to bb88kingwild for two months.
[246:17.25]Ends with a gorilla reading a book.
[246:18.33]It always does.
[246:19.55]Thanks for the two months, dude.
[246:20.45]Dryer, thanks for the two months.
[246:22.39]VindexTV mode now, whatever.
[246:25.27]For two months.
[246:25.75]Thank you guys for the resubs and the bits and all that shit.
[246:31.53]You guys rule.
[246:34.92]You guys rock.
[246:37.62]Yeah, I talked to Vic.
[246:39.70]She said you were around for the first outbreak.
[246:42.23]This game looks bad.
[246:44.17]Well... It ain't great.
[246:46.91]It ain't great.
[246:47.25]Let's just call it at that.
[246:50.07]It ain't great.
[246:50.79]It ain't good.
[246:51.55]It ain't good either.
[246:52.99]Um...
[247:07.07]Let's just put it this way.
[247:08.07]It ain't good.
[247:09.19]It ain't great.
[247:10.98]You can deduce from there how you feel about it.
[247:13.96]Is it bad?
[247:14.46]No, it's not bad.
[247:15.10]This is not bad.
[247:16.22]This is not a bad game.
[247:18.80]It ain't great.
[247:26.33]Alright, so end of the darn.
[247:28.29]End of the darn.
[247:31.71]Good work, guys.
[247:32.89]We're alive.
[247:36.98]Hockey stick?
[247:37.76]Cool.
[247:40.34]Ooh, gotta take that handgun.
[247:46.42]Yeah, I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
[247:52.45]But if I'm gonna be honest, if I'm gonna be real here... Actually, let's make an ice sword.
[248:00.21]Let's talk about how, um...
[248:02.91]Didn't really... didn't really change much... from the world of... like... I don't know, I think there's like a... we're in a new generation now.
[248:15.76]It's been like a couple years.
[248:16.86]I feel like they could have done... they haven't really done anything that's... different at all.
[248:23.40]This is kind of just the exact same game as 3.
[248:27.56]Except... not 3.
[248:31.55]They did like a couple of things that are a little different.
[248:34.99]It's a game.
[248:35.41]Alright, where am I going here?
[248:36.57]Where the fuck am I going?
[248:38.41]Oh boy, oh boy.
[248:39.28]Well, okay.
[249:01.76]That's a far way away.
[249:05.54]So I gotta go backwards, and then bang a right, and then stay on that road.
[249:09.68]I'll keep an ear on their radio channels.
[249:11.60]See what turns up.
[249:12.78]That'd be a real help, Brad.
[249:14.08]Thank you.
[249:19.97]And they took out, like, the... There's no campaign... Wasn't there a campaign co-op in Dead Rising 3?
[249:25.83]Am I crazy?
[249:26.53]I feel like me and Star played this game, like, in the campaign.
[249:30.31]I wanna make sure I'm going the right way.
[249:34.20]To the right, and then straight up.
[249:46.39]Go.
[249:47.01]I mean, there's co-op, but I don't think there's campaign co-op.
[249:55.90]I think it's kind of like Watch Dogs 2.
[249:59.14]Where they just throw you in the open world and say, go have fun.
[250:04.21]I want the sedan.
[250:06.15]It's faster.
[250:06.49]Get in the car!
[250:07.21]Vent nearby.
[250:11.16]Do I dare?
[250:33.52]Fine, I dare.
[250:36.50]I'll destroy the obscurial.
[250:39.75]Plus, there's an exoskeleton suit over here.
[250:43.27]Might as well just do it.
[250:44.39]Well, that guy just fell into my car and threw it.
[250:46.51]Alright, I'm glad.
[250:56.58]You did a great job, guy.
[250:57.76]You fell down and died on top of this.
[251:00.56]Good work.
[251:05.83]Handgun.
[251:06.43]Grenade.
[251:07.91]What do I have for ranged?
[251:12.36]I can take another ranged gun.
[251:18.32]I have a lot of money, too.
[251:19.26]Alright, give me the exoskeleton suit and we'll see what we can do with it.
[251:32.77]I want to get in the suit, not be on top of the suit.
[251:37.64]You don't sound like I'm enjoying... No, I'm enjoying the game.
[251:39.62]I'm definitely like... It's definitely fun to do this stuff.
[251:49.30]But... Like we said... Wait, destroy the equipment.
[251:53.12]Okay.
[251:57.33]Oh, come on!
[251:59.11]Come on!
[252:02.91]Come on.
[252:03.41]I gotta get up there.
[252:04.11]Oh, you got... I don't care.
[252:07.14]We don't have time.
[252:07.78]Let's go.
[252:08.06]I don't give a shit.
[252:11.30]We're going in the darn.
[252:16.79]Going into the darn.
[252:18.23]That's really far away.
[252:23.19]I can't grab onto the edge in this dumb suit.
[252:34.07]I'm not even gonna make it over there in time.
[252:38.20]There's a ladder on the side?
[252:39.28]Well, it's too late now.
[252:42.96]Well, we already are on the way to the darn, so it doesn't matter.
[252:49.90]Please let me get there so I can utilize it for a second.
[252:52.74]Let's see what damning evidence you're hiding.
[253:02.77]Go kill the soldiers!
[253:04.35]New level, 23.
[253:09.10]Why would you throw up your nades right there?
[253:15.56]You're trying to get us all killed?
[253:17.62]Must be execute for this.
[253:24.26]This is pretty cool.
[253:31.82]Gonna explode.
[253:32.82]And I'm gonna go... No, I didn't say Ura.
[253:47.39]I want the thing underneath it.
[253:50.35]You know.
[253:52.55]I know that can't be picked up without an exosuit.
[253:54.57]I want the health pack.
[253:57.51]I can't even walk forward right now.
[254:00.21]I can't leave.
[254:01.40]That's in the way, apparently.
[254:05.56]Okay.
[254:06.94]I'm trying to just get me out of the fucking van.
[254:17.17]What's a boy to do?
[254:18.93]What's a boy to do?
[254:24.41]I can't leave.
[254:24.97]I'm stuck here forever.
[254:31.74]Okay, I got out.
[254:37.78]It was seriously in the way.
[254:40.64]Alright.
[254:44.63]Well, I'm glad that thing got out of the way or despawned or whatever, so now I can pick up the health kit and not get stuck in the back of the van.
[254:52.75]And, hey, that's funny that I was not even... I fucking accidentally just pressed down, so that whole thing was not even worth doing.
[255:01.83]Okay.
[255:02.81]Well, it doesn't even matter.
[255:04.19]There was, shit was everywhere.
[255:05.53]What the, who cares?
[255:06.81]When there's health packs every five fucking feet.
[255:09.24]Who cares, right?
[255:11.34]Oh, you got the Willimate Hydroelectric Station Locker Key.
[255:19.36]Let's just go.
[255:21.88]Open.
[255:22.66]Come on.
[255:25.80]Hello?
[255:25.96]Who's in there?
[255:29.26]I, um...
[255:30.38]Oh, there's a light in the corner.
[255:32.57]Yeah, let me help you out with that light.
[255:33.97]I wonder...
[255:58.58]Cool.
[255:59.62]Dude, this is gonna be in the dark, man.
[256:01.23]Are we still talking?
[256:07.07]That's kind of funny.
[256:08.21]Are we still talking?
[256:10.03]Alright, let's go turn on this stupid thing.
[256:12.21]Let's use the game's dumbest gimmick.
[256:16.67]Find them.
[256:17.33]Where's the switch?
[256:18.45]You said it was over in the corner somewhere?
[256:22.97]Does he, like, have anything on him?
[256:25.67]Turn on the lights.
[256:28.50]Where are the lights again?
[256:30.74]Did he say he was in the corner?
[256:32.54]I wasn't paying any attention to what he said.
[256:36.22]You think he said, like, lights are... I missed everything because I was so mad that I had to use the gimmick in the game.
[256:49.63]Where are the lights?
[256:53.67]Shouldn't there just be a light switch, like, right there?
[257:01.47]Get those lights on.
[257:06.91]Why is there just a light switch?
[257:12.59]Up here?
[257:13.59]This thing?
[257:14.11]Up here?
[257:20.80]I don't... What the fuck?
[257:22.78]Oh, graffiti!
[257:23.76]Cool!
[257:26.24]Doggy or this one?
[257:36.59]I need someone to tell me if I'm missing something here, because... I don't see any lights.
[257:43.96]I see a chair.
[257:47.50]He said it, and I was just too busy not paying any fucking attention.
[258:09.45]Oh my god, Frank!
[258:13.36]I got kidnapped!
[258:14.40]Hey Darcy, how's it going?
[258:17.34]Getting a little over your head, huh?
[258:19.35]You came to rescue me?
[258:21.57]You really are the savior of Willamette.
[258:24.48]Did you guys make that up, or is there a cult somewhere I should be leading?
[258:27.77]Oh, man, no, no.
[258:29.07]Obscurus is in a panic about this monster.
[258:31.87]I think they know something about it.
[258:33.67]Something we don't.
[258:35.59]Was this shit in the other games?
[258:37.69]I don't remember there being, like, this... This type of thing in the old games.
[258:45.60]Am I crazy, or is this just bad?
[258:48.76]I don't know.
[258:50.60]Regain your strength.
[258:51.73]I got this.
[258:58.57]Yeah, now watch this fucking movie.
[259:01.85]Oh, God.
[259:10.48]Take more pictures of stuff.
[259:18.12]See, to me, this feels like... ...bloating the game to make it last longer.
[259:24.11]It just does.
[259:29.08]This is a request to send more exosuits to Warwick.
[259:31.80]For heavy combat, this monster's too fast to be strong for regular use.
[259:34.48]It says they've been hunting it since before the outbreak occurred.
[259:59.30]Can I leave now?
[259:59.94]Fuck, I didn't get it.
[260:01.46]He did this wicked weird face.
[260:03.00]Getting points for this.
[260:25.17]The monster?
[260:26.25]Find the trap.
[260:27.25]Well, you're being left there.
[260:28.79]Sorry, dude.
[260:30.05]Snake!
[260:30.27]Ah, I wasn't quick enough.
[260:57.03]Let's just get to the end there.
[260:57.93]So there's a monster now?
[260:58.89]Sticky bomb.
[260:59.63]Okie dokie.
[260:59.87]First aid kit.
[261:19.33]open that okay alright okay I don't have skill points I do have skill points putting them into the car yeah we want good cars back to fortitude more max health is always a good thing and you know probably at this point probably this now
[261:48.08]Shooting.
[261:48.50]Let's put a... I don't have any more points.
[261:51.80]So let's go fight the fucking monster.
[261:58.09]Is this a bad guy?
[261:58.73]That's a bad guy, isn't it?
[261:59.77]Yeah, it is.
[262:09.81]Does that kill them?
[262:10.55]Or is that just like a... Oh, you choked him out for a second.
[262:13.05]Give me the .50 caliber.
[262:20.79]Point at me target spotted he's missed four times already, but I'm gonna make sure I point at him What a fucking dummy Don't want that Way to go
[262:51.13]You can't... You are such an idiot!
[262:57.06]What a total dumbass.
[263:02.42]I've never seen an enemy that stupid in a video game.
[263:05.42]I don't think I have.
[263:06.36]Do not screw it up this time.
[263:14.44]Go, go, go!
[263:14.66]Wait, what?
[263:15.14]Check it out!
[263:15.54]Engage!
[263:20.90]I fucking can't.
[263:23.24]Who is he?
[263:24.26]Where is he?
[263:25.08]There he is.
[263:25.48]This aiming is gonna drive me up the fucking fence.
[263:33.16]Gonna drive me up the wall.
[263:34.26]I'm fine.
[263:37.64]A lot of forgiving health too.
[263:50.52]Please have there be something really cool at the end of this.
[263:53.82]I'm really hoping that's gonna be a huge, gigantic monster.
[264:12.33]Oh, you fucking bastard!
[264:13.55]Just forget the guns!
[264:15.55]Fuck the guns!
[264:18.56]There's a million health packs, who cares?
[264:20.46]Okay, I kinda care now.
[264:42.81]They kinda keep just coming out of nowhere though, that's the weird thing.
[264:47.37]They just are appearing out of nowhere.
[264:48.99]I'm gonna go with the spike bomb.
[264:58.08]Alright, I hear that now.
[265:03.50]Come on, give me a monster.
[265:08.47]Give me a horrible monster.
[265:16.06]I'm taking my sweet ass time.
[265:26.83]Here we go.
[265:38.77]Move, aim with the mouse.
[265:39.73]This is on Xbox One.
[265:41.78]This isn't on Windows, unfortunately.
[265:46.00]I was told the Windows Store is the worst experience ever.
[265:49.32]So I kind of just didn't even do it.
[265:51.38]Are you going to take the monster away from me after introducing it?
[265:59.80]Please break out.
[266:01.38]Break out of the back and fight me.
[266:04.35]No.
[266:07.65]The boss fight is just a regular guy probably.
[266:09.93]This guy.
[266:10.31]I think he can see me.
[266:14.37]Yeah, he can see me.
[266:15.07]Pretty sure.
[266:18.07]Yes.
[266:20.73]What a monster.
[266:24.56]Alright.
[266:48.33]Okay.
[266:49.40]Remember when you did this already?
[266:51.66]Well, way, way, way, way, way.
[266:53.88]Where did you guys come from?
[266:58.46]Quick, guys!
[266:59.60]The dude with the minigun!
[267:01.38]Just run at him!
[267:07.94]There's just shit going on everywhere.
[267:23.61]I think there's like power packs around, right?
[267:35.32]Oh, Lieutenant.
[267:37.92]Uh-oh.
[267:44.97]Uh... Uh-oh!
[267:48.45]Hello!
[267:49.63]Pick up the health cat.
[267:50.47]No, don't pick up the health cat.
[267:54.47]No, what did I just pick up?
[267:55.35]I picked up like a hard drive.
[267:57.00]Give me like the axe, thank you.
[267:58.40]No, give me the machine gun.
[268:00.85]Get the first aid kit.
[268:26.85]This is fucking stupid.
[268:36.76]I can't fucking do it right now.
[268:51.67]Give me the railgun.
[268:55.13]I'm just so jaded at that shit right now.
[268:57.03]I'm gonna die.
[269:04.17]Come down here again.
[269:04.91]Let me do that same stupid fucking thing.
[269:14.57]He's taunting
[269:44.68]This is real stupid.
[269:46.76]This is like top fucking five.
[269:49.48]Stupid.
[269:51.40]He just comes down, puts his hands up and goes... And then he runs away.
[270:05.32]Give me the axe.
[270:06.20]I wonder if he's the real guy.
[270:13.92]I'm gonna drop down.
[270:15.48]One more idiot.
[270:36.13]Come on, you fucking idiot.
[270:40.16]Alright, get a picture quick.
[270:45.59]Picture.
[270:47.99]Ooh, brutality.
[270:52.19]Brutal, brutal.
[270:54.94]Ooh, let's get another one.
[270:57.44]Oh, wow.
[270:58.82]Unbelievable.
[270:59.38]Let's take a look at night vision mode.
[271:01.68]Way to go.
[271:04.22]Ah, bad cameraman.
[271:07.33]Bad cameraman.
[271:11.68]In Old Town I learned that Obscurus was hunting something
[271:29.09]Like, there was no time.
[271:30.49]There was no fucking time.
[271:32.20]I just forgot.
[271:32.58]Ow!
[271:32.72]Ow!
[271:53.84]That guy jumps down and cries like a little bit, and then he runs away.
[271:57.66]That was like the third boss fight, technically, right?
[272:00.15]Do you guys remember in the other Dead Rising game, the lady that's at the buffet?
[272:03.55]The crazy lady on the motor, like the scooter that's eating at the buffet?
[272:07.23]Where is that?
[272:21.19]Where's the people?
[272:22.23]Where's the weirdos?
[272:23.11]Where's the freaks?
[272:24.10]Where's the interesting shit?
[272:27.00]It's just been guy in a suit with a gun.
[272:32.26]Unless I'm just not even close to the first.
[272:34.75]I don't know.
[272:51.75]That's really missing.
[272:57.05]The military guys in the suits.
[272:59.53]They're still here.
[273:00.69]There's still people here, I guess.
[273:02.47]Sounds like a man.
[273:28.21]I feel like this is the Resident Evil 6 of Dead Rising games.
[273:31.67]If that makes any sense to you guys, hopefully it does.
[273:34.99]Oh well.
[273:35.75]In before the monster is like a guy in an exosuit.
[274:04.06]Let me pursue the convoy.
[274:06.22]Let's just see what happens if I actually get to that convoy.
[274:09.74]Are there any cars or anything that I ran by?
[274:13.14]I probably walked by.
[274:14.00]There's a jump right there too.
[274:17.83]I think I left the car back there, but who cares.
[274:19.87]And then the soldiers come in.
[274:32.35]A lot of cool things over here that I'd love to jump on.
[274:42.70]Is that a chainsaw?
[274:43.64]I don't want a chainsaw.
[274:48.12]Please jump the fence.
[274:48.78]Please jump the fence.
[274:49.50]Yay.
[274:57.87]When I pursue this convoy, we'll see if I'm going to keep playing.
[275:00.65]I wanted to stop at around midnight anyways.
[275:02.35]We've got like another 20-30 minutes.
[275:04.87]That's enough to see what's in the truck.
[275:10.40]What the hell is going on here?
[275:14.04]We've got to keep going, keep going, keep going.
[275:16.56]Ooh, watch out for the helicopter.
[275:18.42]It's the military.
[275:21.34]You know that they're always involved.
[275:22.60]I sure do love the smell of burning corpses.
[275:27.67]I can get in there, can't I?
[275:30.72]Can't get in this?
[275:36.18]Apparently, I guess I can't get in this one.
[275:39.38]There's military people everywhere.
[275:43.94]Get off me!
[275:47.95]Resident Evil 5 was fun.
[275:48.89]Yeah, I like Resident Evil 5.
[275:51.89]I think it was the start of them going down the road of this is now a third person shooter game.
[276:00.01]But I thought it was fun.
[276:01.99]Especially the co-op.
[276:02.67]You could have a friend play through the whole game with you.
[276:05.29]I thought it was good enough.
[276:06.59]Don't get out of the way, you stupid idiots.
[276:18.91]Yeah, that's true.
[276:19.91]I have not been able to throw a plate yet, so I can't like stop the stream.
[276:29.99]Can I get in that sedan?
[276:30.89]I don't think so.
[276:39.00]I'm so close.
[276:45.04]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[276:47.61]No, it's just giving me... It's just a breadcrumb trail.
[276:50.05]Come on!
[276:52.51]Pursue... Keep, like, pursuing the convoy.
[276:54.43]Just keep going this way.
[276:55.45]If I could get in the school bus, this would make the game, like, five times cooler.
[277:00.78]Get out of here!
[277:10.00]Why am I putting my hands in the air?
[277:20.97]Get me to the battlefield now.
[277:23.30]I'm ready.
[277:26.88]Isn't Dead Rising supposed to be really goofy?
[277:30.30]Goofy is a good word, but... I guess maybe the word we're looking for is interesting.
[277:43.07]No, it's this way.
[277:46.29]Is this some kind of escort mission?
[277:49.05]While I trail this, I'm going to say hello to some subs.
[277:55.89]Thank you to Pogo Loco for three months.
[277:58.61]As long as packages keep missing their delivery date, Jerma keeps getting subs.
[278:03.78]Wait, what?
[278:07.98]Thank you, Pogo.
[278:10.75]Also, Tickle the Fat, thank you for your sub, and War Void for eight months.
[278:16.64]Is leftover tapioca good?
[278:18.38]I don't think I've ever had tapioca in my whole life, so I wouldn't know.
[278:23.63]Thanks a lot, guys.
[278:24.43]And also, thanks to Never Trust a Purple, thank you for the bits.
[278:35.53]Mr. Sneak Man for 400.
[278:37.97]Rayburn 99.
[278:39.69]Lord Walden, you try hard.
[278:42.83]Sling Max.
[278:44.02]And Dark Moshi.
[278:45.40]Thank you for the bits, guys.
[278:48.06]I am going to play Resident Evil 7 when it comes out on launch.
[278:50.56]I'm going to be in full VR.
[278:53.98]It's the first time I've ever really experienced VR.
[278:56.66]It is going to be horrible.
[278:57.90]But it should be fun.
[278:59.69]Alright, what happened?
[279:00.55]He broke out.
[279:01.17]I can't believe it.
[279:01.87]He's a monster.
[279:02.79]Look out.
[279:04.15]Something like that, right?
[279:05.71]I need morphine.
[279:07.23]There's some at the North Peak safe house.
[279:10.07]If you grab me a few hits, I'll tell you what we were hauling.
[279:13.31]Wait, what?
[279:14.99]Alright, alright, I'll think about it.
[279:23.23]When's the big monster reveal?
[279:24.77]Oh, come on.
[279:25.87]I drove all the way back here.
[279:32.73]It drove all the way to go the other way.
[279:34.56]Because some guy wants some drugs.
[279:41.74]The next box is a helicopter in an exosuit.
[279:49.99]What am I looking for?
[279:50.67]Uh...
[279:57.68]Alright.
[280:00.24]I think I may have hit my wall here.
[280:01.70]I'm gonna have to go all the way back to where I was before.
[280:13.61]Thanks.
[280:14.77]Well, I guess not all the way.
[280:16.67]Okay, if it was any further than this, I would have stopped playing it.
[280:22.21]I was getting really close to stopping.
[280:24.80]I still am.
[280:28.26]Search for the morphine.
[280:30.12]This is another safe house, isn't it?
[280:35.96]Just drop fucking bombs everywhere.
[280:37.62]Even if I get hurt, who cares?
[280:40.12]Clear it out quick.
[280:42.10]Are you working out in here, zombies?
[280:49.66]Does everyone just die, explode?
[280:52.56]Morphine, morphine, morphine.
[280:54.14]Where is it?
[280:58.95]Go get it.
[280:59.47]At least I'll get another safe house.
[281:11.40]This person's unhidden.
[281:16.14]They're not still alive, are they?
[281:18.06]No.
[281:22.26]Locked.
[281:25.78]Watch me have to take a picture of the morphine.
[281:42.27]Okay, well, that's different.
[281:46.84]Extreme Metal Gear?
[281:47.66]That's actually... I was thinking about Extreme Metal... Oh my god, my nose is so stuffed right now.
[281:54.74]Hold on.
[281:55.58]I'm sorry.
[281:56.08]I apologize in advance.
[281:56.98]Give me one second.
[282:03.70]Sorry about that.
[282:06.38]Morphine.
[282:07.50]Okay.
[282:09.97]I really should just clear this out.
[282:11.91]Where's the other zombies?
[282:17.07]You guys didn't die from the explosion?
[282:18.33]What?
[282:19.84]It's not it.
[282:29.23]this more.
[282:30.27]By the way, this acid base, or acid, you know, this thing, has lasted a long time.
[282:39.79]Where the fuck is this guy coming from?
[282:49.10]Where's the hive?
[282:51.18]Okay, okay.
[282:53.84]Alright, okay.
[282:58.02]Okay, what is up here?
[283:08.94]Oh yeah, good, great, great.
[283:11.52]Floating in goddamn outer space!
[283:15.67]What?
[283:16.11]God!
[283:27.18]Why are you all here?
[283:36.84]It's safe, I promise!
[283:38.28]There's only like two zombies!
[283:39.80]You guys are gonna be fine, trust me!
[283:48.64]Who's still alive?
[283:50.34]There's a guy up here that's in the corner, I bet.
[283:55.12]Oh, boy.
[283:56.16]Okay.
[284:02.86]Neutralized.
[284:03.48]You were supposed to be dead.
[284:26.28]Get me the fuck out of here.
[284:29.85]Get me the fuck out of here.
[284:30.89]I don't even care about anything right now.
[284:33.35]I just want to know what the monster was.
[284:35.58]Tell me what the monster is.
[284:36.36]I'm going off the jump.
[284:42.26]As a human.
[284:49.09]At least I skipped it.
[284:50.13]Alright.
[284:52.97]What's the monster?
[284:53.55]I can't see so good.
[284:57.78]You're a good man, West.
[284:59.70]But look, I can't tell you what we were hauling.
[285:02.75]But didn't he just tell me?
[285:05.23]I can say that Command, they were calling it a recovery op.
[285:09.69]We were shipping it out of town for R&D purposes.
[285:12.46]Interesting.
[285:13.96]Okay.
[285:15.00]Yep.
[285:15.90]Find a blanket.
[285:17.58]There's some booze here.
[285:18.68]Just...
[285:31.93]Well, that's gonna be it.
[285:37.17]That's gonna be the end of the stream.
[285:42.90]Oh, shit!
[285:44.16]Investigate the wreckage.
[285:45.60]There's a fire over here.
[285:53.16]Pull the camera out, please.
[285:57.24]Fucking do it.
[285:58.50]Do what I say, Frank.
[286:02.36]Do it!
[286:03.88]Fucking do it.
[286:08.04]He won't fucking do it.
[286:09.02]He won't take the picture in the fire.
[286:12.50]Alright, am I still on fire?
[286:13.36]I gotta get on fire.
[286:14.76]And then... Go.
[286:18.12]No, it's not gonna happen.
[286:21.02]Well, yeah, that's gonna be it.
[286:23.94]Uh... Well, let's take a look at my photos, cause I mean, let's just see.
[286:28.22]I took a hundred and seven... Alright, let's go.
[286:31.63]We'll start.
[286:32.89]Toggle the info.
[286:35.41]Here are my photos.
[286:39.97]I can't scroll through them.
[286:44.91]I have to select them individually.
[286:49.36]Wait, what?
[286:52.10]You'd think that that would be something that you'd want to have... I have to select them individually.
[287:00.05]Well, that killed this whole thing.
[287:16.20]I just...
[287:22.30]This is my favorite one.
[287:27.66]That's the best one.
[287:30.82]Oh, what the fuck?
[287:31.54]I take a picture of five chairs?
[287:33.26]What?
[287:34.16]Why did I do that?
[287:35.22]That's weird.
[287:41.37]This one's pretty good, too.
[287:51.71]No, remember when that happened?
[287:52.69]Remember when she was trying to get through the grate?
[287:58.42]There's a picture of the monster that I didn't get.
[288:02.88]Here's the guy that was flying away.
[288:04.68]That was not bad.
[288:16.66]Alright, well... There's Dead Rising 4 for you.
[288:24.99]Um... So for Thursday, I'm not sure I'm gonna play this again.
[288:31.43]I don't know, I kind of want to know what the monster is.
[288:35.73]But is that enough for me to play the game?
[288:37.15]Probably not.
[288:39.21]I'll just go, like, YouTube it or something.
[288:43.01]Final consensus on the game... It's a fun action game.
[288:46.65]It's not a fun Dead Rising game.
[288:49.95]And by fun action game, I mean it was cool to shoot zombies sometimes.
[288:59.92]Yeah, I didn't really have a whole lot of expectations going in.
[289:03.52]It's not like I really like... Oh, fuck, I was so looking forward to this game.
[289:07.26]No.
[289:09.34]I just figured it would be fun to try it.
[289:13.14]Look, I didn't dislike my... I talked about it before.
[289:15.24]I didn't dislike my time in the game, but... The game's not that good.
[289:21.01]I would just say.
[289:22.63]Play Dead Rising 1.
[289:24.53]Or Dead Rising 2.
[289:28.37]It was pretty average.
[289:29.57]Yeah.
[289:32.40]If you could throw objects, the timer was there, and they actually had interesting characters, then I would say this is a recommend.
[289:42.88]At this point right now, this is a not recommend for me.
[289:46.98]Do not spend $60 on this game.
[289:50.47]I would recommend that.
[289:54.55]Even if they had, like, cool creatures or monsters or, like, the psychopath thing.
[290:02.93]I feel like they made a third-person shooter.
[290:07.33]Well, yeah, like Dynasty Warriors.
[290:08.62]Somebody mentioned Dynasty Warriors with zombies, and that's pretty much what I could agree with.
[290:17.30]But thanks, everybody, for coming out.
[290:21.79]I will see you guys on Thursday.
[290:24.57]I don't have any plans to do anything tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow night.
[290:28.96]But Thursday, Friday, we'll be at it again.
[290:31.24]I might start on Thursday the Warlock on Firetop Mountain, which is another Steve Jackson game.
[290:39.12]So if you liked Sorcery, if that was what you're into, we might start that new Steve Jackson game on Thursday.
[290:46.00]Or we'll do something else.
[290:49.04]But thank you.
[290:50.24]By the way, if you want to know, if you're curious, there is a Discord now.
[290:57.85]There is a open to the public Discord.
[291:01.13]It's not just sub only.
[291:03.44]There are sub only rooms and there are sub only places you can go to.
[291:08.10]But if you want to hang out in the Discord, I'm sure one of the mods has already linked it a couple times.
[291:14.26]If you connect to Twitch, you can use the emotes and stuff there.
[291:17.19]There was just a lot of, um... A lot of people wanted it.
[291:21.03]A bunch of people were saying, oh, you should have a Discord.
[291:22.47]You should have a Discord.
[291:23.13]Get a Discord.
[291:24.79]So, if you care about it, there's a lot of great people that hang out there, so... It's there.
[291:30.26]I don't necessarily, uh... I don't, like, run it.
[291:33.44]I kind of... It's like an officially supported, unofficial, official Discord server.
[291:39.48]So, it's ran by the mods and the community, so...
[291:44.57]Hope you enjoy it.
[291:45.13]I love how I had mentioned... Yeah, let me mention that in the last 10 fucking seconds in the stream.
[291:55.10]Hey, that's 10 seconds.
[291:56.30]Stream's about to be over.
[291:57.77]Hey, you know, I have a Discord now.
[292:01.91]How do subs get in the sub?
[292:02.84]There's just a sub only room.
[292:04.10]When you link your Twitch, I believe the server does a refresh every hour to see who's subscribed and then you get the sub only benefit.
[292:13.48]But it is not a sub only Discord.
[292:16.22]It's open to the public.
[292:18.42]Don't make me have to change that.
[292:22.60]Let's just put it that way.
[292:25.21]The same rules apply in the Discord that they do here.
[292:28.61]Just don't be a psycho.
[292:31.64]The obvious stuff applies.
[292:32.94]Just fucking... You know, just be chill.
[292:37.84]And with that, take it easy, guys.
[292:40.74]Well, no, stream's not starting soon.
[292:42.22]That's the wrong video.
[292:43.86]I'm trying to play this video.
[292:47.28]Good night.
[292:48.00]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[292:49.94]Take care, everybody.
[292:51.34]Thanks for coming out.
[292:52.12]And... Thank you, George Maka, for the three months.
[292:55.18]TotallyNotCoconut.
[292:56.64]Coleman172.
[292:57.06]Vandal.
[293:01.02]Thank you, free subs.
[293:02.72]Thank you, Purple for the bits.
[293:03.60]Thank you, other guys, for the bits tonight.
[293:05.00]It was a bunch of money that came through.
[293:06.32]Have a wonderful evening.
[293:11.47]See you guys Thursday.
[293:13.05]Good night.
[294:03.15]you
