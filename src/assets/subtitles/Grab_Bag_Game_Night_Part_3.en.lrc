[00:37.72]Oh, man.
[00:43.06]I put too much milk in my coffee, and it's already causing me distress.
[00:55.63]What's going on?
[00:56.15]How are you?
[01:01.91]Why coffee and not cocoa?
[01:02.93]Cocoa.
[01:06.82]I'm a coffee first beverage kind of guy.
[01:12.04]What that means is the first beverage I have every single day is coffee.
[01:17.92]Every day.
[01:19.36]That is the first beverage.
[01:21.62]Maybe water.
[01:23.16]Water will be good too.
[01:29.00]Maybe like six to eight ounces of water.
[01:33.30]Flush out the system.
[01:35.52]And then, usually it's just a black coffee.
[01:39.40]Like 30 minutes later, 20 minutes later.
[01:40.90]You're going to get osteoporosis.
[01:46.35]There's so much shit wrong with my body, I don't care.
[01:49.41]Can I just be honest with you?
[01:55.19]Oh no, I don't want that.
[01:55.83]Osteoporosis.
[01:56.27]Osteoporosis.
[02:02.25]Hey, uh, black coffee is not bad for you either.
[02:05.27]Have you seen the studies?
[02:07.45]Have you seen the studies?
[02:10.95]Isn't it good for your liver?
[02:13.13]Have you seen the studies, by the way?
[02:19.27]Yeah, don't drink ten of them.
[02:22.82]How many of these things do we have to talk about where if you just drink one...
[02:28.86]Every few days or like once in the morning or every other day.
[02:32.65]Don't drink 10.
[02:35.97]Have you seen the studies?
[02:41.35]Alright.
[02:41.81]I'm being weird, but that's fine.
[02:43.77]Kind of a weird day.
[02:44.69]What about bush light?
[02:46.18]Oh, okay.
[02:48.66]I get it.
[02:57.09]But yeah, so let's talk about it.
[03:00.45]I did just say milk.
[03:02.09]I think today was kind of a funny day.
[03:03.75]I felt like making a latte.
[03:06.19]I just took espresso and put a little bit of oat milk in it.
[03:11.32]A little bit of sweetness.
[03:14.82]Mix it up with some ice.
[03:18.66]I kind of felt like shit a couple days ago and yesterday.
[03:21.30]I feel bad because the horsemen, we were supposed to do a stream yesterday.
[03:24.74]And I kind of just couldn't.
[03:28.37]I did not feel great.
[03:29.27]I had kind of a bad headache.
[03:33.63]But I'm doing fine.
[03:34.99]I'm doing better today.
[03:35.67]I would say much better today.
[03:41.06]So I had to cancel on the horseman.
[03:45.52]But it's all good.
[03:46.82]I think we're going to do something again on Tuesday?
[03:49.36]Monday?
[03:49.63]Probably Tuesday?
[03:52.45]Maybe Wednesday?
[03:53.59]We'll get something going.
[03:58.77]So today, after the ads start, of course, we're going to be doing some more old stuff.
[04:05.91]I only played for like three hours a couple nights ago.
[04:08.19]I wanted to do at least six.
[04:10.96]I was kind of in it.
[04:13.06]But I didn't really feel great.
[04:15.42]There's a lot of stuff to play.
[04:16.54]Some of these I think you're going to be very excited about.
[04:18.48]Some maybe not so excited about.
[04:19.74]We'll have to see.
[04:25.37]Yeah, let's let the ads play out.
[04:29.61]And I'll see you in three minutes.
[04:32.89]Let's hope they actually start.
[04:33.91]I'm going to stay here.
[04:34.59]That person in pre-stream made fun of me for this.
[04:39.70]But it's okay.
[04:41.98]Did you drink milk today?
[04:42.84]I mean, I'm drinking a coffee with a milk substitute in it.
[04:47.62]Does that count?
[05:02.45]But they actually started on time.
[05:04.87]That was a first, by the way.
[05:07.20]I have ran ads at the beginning of the stream for the last two months.
[05:10.84]That's the first time I think it's ever happened when it said it was supposed to.
[05:14.28]Alright.
[05:16.53]I'll be back.
[05:17.27]Give me a few minutes.
[08:17.80]Hello?
[08:18.42]I'm back.
[08:20.46]Uh, yeah, I did hear about the, and I, what I mean hear about, I saw the Grimace and, um, other McDonald's character Minecraft ad.
[08:31.63]I wanted to get the council's take on it.
[08:37.51]What's even in it?
[08:38.07]What's in the, the Minecraft McDonald's meal?
[08:48.88]It's a what?
[08:49.78]It's a chicken jockey?
[08:56.25]What's a chicken jockey?
[09:00.15]Am I saying something bad?
[09:01.79]I don't know.
[09:05.72]I don't wa- What do you all- A hundred people just wrote that!
[09:09.38]I don't know what the fuck I'm even saying.
[09:11.78]What did I just say?
[09:17.58]A hundred people wrote that.
[09:19.12]I thought that's what it was.
[09:20.44]It's a movie reference.
[09:22.10]Oh, okay.
[09:23.07]I don't know what I'm saying.
[09:28.73]My houses in Minecraft are two types of dirt.
[09:34.51]And I get excited when I have wood floors.
[09:38.15]Alright, you guys ready?
[09:38.69]We're going to start it off... We're going to start off with a car game.
[09:43.89]Not going to play Death Trap Dungeon right away.
[09:49.05]Oh, it's... Okay.
[09:51.05]I see.
[09:55.22]I forget what the name of this one is, but it looks very interesting.
[09:58.48]We'll just say that.
[10:05.48]Opening it now.
[10:07.07]I think the volume should be fine, but you never know.
[10:09.77]Just be careful.
[10:10.63]Let's find out.
[10:17.84]It says, SRS Street Racing Syndicate.
[10:23.21]Ah.

[10:31.63]Okay, Pac-Man does not condone driving erratically.
[10:37.62]This is fucking loud.
[10:50.23]Nice.
[10:50.95]You know when you get all the drill sounds, it's going to be a good one.
[10:54.48]I hope we get to design a car.
[11:05.52]This is every 13 year old's favorite car.
[11:14.18]I always thought this was dangerous.
[11:16.02]Standing in the road like this.
[11:18.98]Holy shit, I thought they ran over.
[11:29.39]Automatic letter grade.
[11:30.17]Well, it's a driving game.
[11:36.90]I don't think even street racers drive this erratically, by the way.
[11:41.26]This is incredibly dangerous.
[11:47.95]holy shit people are getting hurt no no no turn turn
[12:10.21]Alright, so who wins the race?
[12:12.27]I don't even know who won.
[12:12.95]I think Yellow Car?
[12:21.97]Put your hands up.
[12:23.34]Wanna put your hands up.
[12:24.72]Wanna just stand up.
[12:26.20]Wanna put your hands up.
[12:27.56]Everybody just stand up.
[12:29.92]Oh dear.
[12:31.04]Yeah.
[12:36.83]This is going to be a... Okay, let's do new profile.
[12:43.57]It doesn't matter.
[12:44.35]How about just me?
[12:50.04]Not a single man in any of these advertisements, by the way.
[12:53.34]This is okay.
[12:57.12]Apparently.
[13:05.77]Uh, how loud is it?
[13:06.59]Should I turn it down?
[13:08.17]What the fuck is going on?
[13:09.51]Alright, hold on.
[13:15.19]Let me turn it down a little.
[13:16.63]Are we sure this is a car game?
[13:27.18]It's still loud.
[13:29.12]Is that better?
[13:31.25]Better?
[13:33.43]Better?

[14:25.56]The cops popped Eddie last night for street racing.
[14:28.41]What?
[14:28.75]Man, if we don't run, I'm out three Gs.
[14:33.03]You're right.
[14:35.31]Who am I?
[14:35.65]I thought I was the cameraman.
[14:37.19]I'm not the hired cameraman.
[14:38.29]I'm now driving the car.
[14:39.23]Okay.
[14:39.73]I guess it's me driving this.
[14:40.72]I don't know how to drive.
[14:42.88]I don't know what button it is.
[14:44.42]We need 3000?
[15:05.76]Okay, I guess it's up on the arrows.
[15:07.60]I don't know how to brake.
[15:15.03]They're in first place already.
[15:16.27]The cameraman's better.
[15:16.95]Look at how far away everybody is already.
[15:25.10]Actually kind of handles pretty good.
[15:26.40]I'm not going to lie.
[15:30.53]Somebody right next to me.
[15:31.55]Should I crash into them?
[15:33.73]Is there a handbrake?
[15:34.43]I should probably look at the controls.
[15:43.33]I love how the first race, by the way, we're on... Oh my god, I can't talk and do... I cannot talk and drive.
[15:48.65]I'll get it back.
[15:52.86]Uh, the... Hey, by the way, I want you to go on the level one Mario circuit.
[16:00.62]I already passed the guy, it's fine.
[16:09.53]It's actually funny, I'm a very silent driver.
[16:11.77]I'm like, I usually kind of keep my mouth shut while I drive.
[16:15.83]Sometimes I'll say a few things.
[16:20.43]How do I use the, what is it, nitrous?
[16:22.05]What is that?
[16:22.49]I think that's brake.
[16:36.90]It's actually kind of hard to lose, I'll be honest.
[16:40.26]Woo!
[16:40.88]Alright, am I gonna get the three Gs?
[16:50.01]First place, right?
[16:50.65]That should be three Gs.

[25:03.41]And then engine tuning.
[25:09.29]I'm a Greddy guy, you know what I mean?
[25:10.46]That's my brand.
[25:11.72]I don't even know what that does.
[25:18.46]I think Greddy just has a... I think the reputation is just a little bit better.
[25:22.10]It has more... I like the torque that it has.
[25:24.00]I like the give that it gives.
[25:25.46]I like the fact that it allows the engine to get the fuel a little bit easier.
[25:33.62]I just, like, swallowed really hard.
[25:35.14]Okay.
[25:35.80]Uh, brakes.
[25:37.49]Brembo.
[25:38.65]Yep, that's a good brand.

[26:34.80]Let's do it.
[26:35.76]This thing is going to be sick.
[26:38.77]Let's go.
[26:40.67]I don't want to spend all my money.
[26:46.91]This thing is... Look at this thing.
[26:49.71]Imagine getting picked up.
[26:51.62]Imagine you're going to go on a date and somebody pulls up in one of these.
[26:56.24]I want to get a sticker.
[26:58.74]I want to get a sticker that says Greti inside.
[27:02.90]Right on the door here, right there.
[27:12.62]I don't want to crash because what if I... What is this?
[27:15.98]That's not what the crew race is.
[27:30.24]You looking to make a reputation for yourself?
[27:32.82]Yeah?
[27:33.74]Adrian challenges you to a point-to-point race.
[27:36.67]The stake is $750.
[27:37.49]Wait, I have to put the money up?
[27:40.31]See you at the finish line.
[27:43.19]I'll be waiting.
[27:44.87]Oh, shit.
[27:46.61]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[27:47.83]Where's the finish line?
[27:52.23]Get fucking lost.
[27:54.03]Ready, inside.
[27:54.85]There are other cars on the road.
[28:04.74]Oh shit man, I didn't know he had Greddy!
[28:09.30]And he like... He pulls up to the finish line like that.
[28:27.91]He's right up my ass.
[28:32.77]Okay, do all cars get nitrous or do... I feel like he's going to use it.
[28:43.03]I'm going... How am I going... I'm going 100 miles per hour right now.
[28:45.67]That doesn't feel like it.
[28:55.66]Watch that turn.
[28:59.94]That's... That was tight.
[29:02.85]Gotta use it here.
[29:08.71]Did he beep at me?
[29:09.29]You better not pass me.
[29:10.95]Please don't.
[29:14.38]No!
[29:14.68]You just proto-triggered me.
[29:15.92]Don't do that.
[29:16.46]I got him.
[29:21.38]I got him.
[29:21.68]He crashed.
[29:26.44]I'll take 700 bucks, please.
[29:33.84]Here we go.
[29:40.27]2400.
[29:40.31]That wasn't even the crew race.
[29:45.56]Shut up.
[29:45.90]Who's we going to be?
[29:59.67]The hell was that?
[30:00.35]That's distracting.
[30:08.86]We do polls for races?
[30:10.36]Um, if they can happen fast enough.
[30:12.18]Alright, I don't want to do that one again.
[30:13.48]I want to actually do this storyline.
[30:20.82]I still feel like it's too loud.
[30:21.88]Am I crazy?
[30:26.22]I dropped it a shitload.
[30:38.87]Feels a little bit better.
[30:43.88]You're crazy, but it is also loud.
[30:52.36]Turn that shit up, dude.
[30:58.41]That was the lamest way I could have said that.
[31:08.78]Hey, turn that shit up.
[31:10.94]That was like a bad actor.
[31:13.28]Alright, let's go.
[31:14.26]Do I have any nitrous?
[31:15.18]Do I have to buy it every time?
[31:17.70]I want to put shit like that on my car.
[31:30.76]This is a nemesis battle.
[31:33.89]Okay, respect.
[31:35.48]I need to put up 1,000.
[31:37.30]I have 100 HP, which I feel like if my health goes to zero, I'm going to be in trouble.
[31:44.96]This one's 125 HP.
[31:45.79]150 HP is probably the best.
[31:48.27]That's a lot of health.
[31:49.35]Maybe I should put the anti's a little higher.
[31:53.17]I can only do this one.
[31:54.25]Okay.
[32:00.93]How much is to repair the car?
[32:03.19]My car was already fucked up.
[32:05.27]Let's go.
[32:11.11]Wait, what's going on?
[32:13.17]Brian, Mike, and Adrian are in the race?
[32:16.21]Who am I picking?
[32:16.81]Who, uh, except, oh.
[32:18.79]This guy's putting up $1,700 and his car is a piece of shit.
[32:28.15]Let's take this guy up on his wager.
[32:29.37]This guy, look at this.
[32:30.05]Zero to 60.
[32:30.33]His top speed is dog shit.
[32:32.87]He's not going to get there.
[32:39.50]Mine is dog shit too.
[32:41.42]Yeah, but I mean, he's not going to make it.
[32:42.88]Bet against Adrian.
[32:50.90]I don't think I can.
[32:51.58]I don't have enough money.
[32:54.34]I can only accept Mike's wager.
[32:55.92]I'll accept Brian's wager.
[32:58.74]Look at this car.
[33:00.28]Oh, wow.
[33:01.62]Yikes.
[33:02.26]Okay, let's go.
[33:11.55]They do that thing.
[33:13.37]They do that with the... It's like the fucking night elf thing.
[33:16.54]Do you know what I mean?
[33:17.10]The night elf like dance thing.
[33:27.91]What is happening?
[33:32.57]Alright, second place.
[33:34.83]Why are you taking the turn like a grandma?
[33:40.53]Get out of the way.
[33:45.25]One, two.
[33:46.03]I said one, two.
[33:47.13]Stand up.
[33:47.79]One, two.
[33:49.53]I'm getting points for doing cool shit.
[33:51.39]Alright, hold on.
[34:05.34]hey one two that was a huge drift nice swerving I'm playing keyboard driving it stinks
[34:33.62]Now that's what we call racing.
[34:36.10]Big.
[34:36.76]Alright, just don't lose first place and I'm good.
[34:55.45]He's right here.
[34:56.30]I'm going to have to break him.
[34:57.88]I have to break.
[34:58.42]I have to break and just smash into him.
[35:02.64]Where is he?
[35:02.92]I don't know.
[35:04.52]How do you change camera?
[35:06.39]He's right here.
[35:10.21]I can feel his shadow encroaching me.
[35:17.50]No!
[35:33.47]You want to be in a back position anyways in the last lap.
[35:37.08]It's just like Mario Kart.
[35:37.98]You don't want to be in first place.
[35:38.92]And look, why would you want to be in first place?
[35:44.93]I'm staying right behind this guy until the last second.
[35:59.60]Zero to 100 in two seconds.
[36:01.52]Okay.
[36:02.68]No, that's actually not what he's doing.
[36:11.11]Good.
[36:11.47]Clean.
[36:14.03]Clean.
[36:14.43]Come on.
[36:14.89]Come on, you little Jetta.
[36:16.21]Come on.
[36:17.97]Cross it.
[36:22.24]Oh, he's right behind me.
[36:24.04]Oh, yeah.
[36:26.78]Oh, my car's kind of fucked up.
[36:32.70]I guess I got 10,000 points.
[36:33.76]I feel like I was just like kind of coming on the way back from the grocery store and I decided to participate.
[36:50.79]I got a thousand respect points, 750 bucks.
[36:54.03]Oh, Brian.
[36:55.83]Brian losing.
[36:56.89]Wait, can I, I want to view the replay.
[37:02.07]Toggle filters?
[37:05.65]What filters can I do?
[37:07.08]I clearly tried to hit that lady.
[37:16.02]Well, I'm showing the evidence right now.
[37:18.48]Toggle filter.
[37:19.44]I guess I'm just seeing from the back.
[37:25.76]Oh, that was awful!
[37:33.35]I'll listen to Jetta.
[37:37.73]Where's the camera?
[37:45.12]Okay, I'm not doing that filter anymore.
[37:51.62]You can see the guy tailing you from the back, yeah.
[37:55.54]I want to see when I, when I brake checked him off.
[38:03.83]I love features like this.
[38:05.03]Okay, to all you game developers out there, please listen to me.
[38:10.35]It doesn't matter.
[38:11.07]I know you're probably sitting there thinking,
[38:13.78]No, but like what if it sucks?
[38:15.45]What if it's like kind of broken?
[38:16.59]What if it like doesn't... We don't care.
[38:20.19]Being able to watch stupid shit like this, if it's not going to add much time to the development process, I assure you we want it.
[38:28.42]We want it.
[38:29.22]It doesn't matter what the game is either.
[38:30.48]It could be any game.
[38:31.72]Forget about driving games.
[38:33.96]This could be anything.
[38:34.70]It could be a shooter.
[38:35.39]It could be a football game.
[38:36.31]It could be... It could be anything.
[38:39.83]It could be an action-adventure game.
[38:41.53]You let me replay the last five minutes from all these different pre-baked camera angles.
[38:47.77]I assure you... Look at that.
[38:49.17]You're probably going to be like, oh, no, that didn't look good.
[38:51.19]I don't care.
[38:51.53]It looked great.
[38:52.23]It looked great, actually.
[38:58.28]Alright.
[38:58.60]I think I break check him right here.
[39:07.20]You can feel the paranoia, too.
[39:09.71]This is right now.
[39:10.27]I'm going to the right behind me.
[39:11.45]I'm sorry.
[39:11.89]Oh my God.
[39:12.09]They're right behind me.
[39:21.45]Okay.
[39:21.75]Well, we got to see it.
[39:26.18]Cool.
[39:26.34]Alright.
[39:27.40]I'm into it.
[39:28.64]I think we stay with this one for another few minutes.
[39:30.92]We're going again.
[39:34.64]Race two.
[39:36.12]Wait, the car is wicked fucked up.
[39:41.25]Let's go, Adrian.
[39:42.61]Wanna fuck around?
[39:43.21]I'll put two... That's all my money.
[39:44.47]I don't give a shit.
[39:44.99]My car's a beat up piece of shit right now.
[39:47.68]You think I care?
[39:48.58]Alright, I can't... I actually can't screw around.
[39:59.94]Still fucked up?
[40:00.64]I think the front is still messed up.
[40:05.10]This is just a square, by the way.
[40:16.59]Microphone 2, 1, 2.
[40:18.49]Microphone 2, 1, 2.
[40:19.13]Sometimes you gotta take out the competition!
[40:25.43]I have $2000 on the line on that guy.
[40:40.86]Alright, this is a quick one.
[40:48.13]Don't let him pass.
[40:48.67]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[41:01.72]7-10 split.
[41:02.18]Here we go.
[41:02.52]Taking this turn a little too wide, Adrian.
[41:25.60]I'm being way too aggressive.
[41:35.72]Good alright, just keep it right here.
[41:37.06]Don't do anything stupid.
[41:37.80]He spun out.
[41:38.72]He literally flipped over.
[41:41.00]I'm just looking how far ahead I am.
[41:42.00]They all cry.
[41:42.58]I can't wait to see that on the replay.
[41:43.80]Hey hey froze.
[41:45.52]Can't wait to see that on the replay.
[42:04.08]Don't pass me.
[42:05.36]Don't pass me!
[42:06.92]Yeah!
[42:07.76]We're good.
[42:08.57]Alright, I'm getting kind of loaded here.
[42:24.14]Alright, I wonder how much it costs to repair this.
[42:26.24]Should I just buy a new car?
[42:40.43]Do you want to see the replay?
[42:41.41]I kind of do.
[42:41.83]This one was quick.
[42:59.81]Mike broke even?
[43:01.45]Oh, did Mike bet somebody else?
[43:10.69]I like this one.
[43:11.53]I like this game a lot.
[43:13.47]It's trying to be exactly what it set out to be.
[43:16.51]I just got scared of my own replay.
[43:21.40]It's exactly what it set out to be.
[43:24.56]It's just a racing game where you just drive the car and you just make money.
[43:37.07]Why are they riding on the sidewalk?
[43:43.52]These people suck.
[43:45.99]No wonder I'm winning every race.
[43:47.53]These guys are driving on the curb.
[43:54.72]Did you play Burnout Paradise?
[43:56.82]I played one of the Burnout games before, didn't I?
[44:01.00]They are really fun though.
[44:08.10]Yeah, I played Paradise for probably like a few hours.
[44:11.94]Oh, the webcam driver's license.
[44:13.60]Oh, that's right.
[44:14.32]I forgot about that.
[44:19.02]Yeah, I had like a bathrobe on.
[44:20.94]Hey, it was Sunday afternoon gaming.
[44:31.14]Sunday afternoon gaming, okay?
[44:34.81]Alright, I think we got what we wanted out of this.
[44:36.39]Alright, so now what?
[44:38.95]Is there one more maybe?
[44:40.15]Okay, this is the last one.
[44:43.87]Oh, Adrian's out of money.
[44:45.41]Adrian, this was $1,700 before.
[44:47.61]Now it's $1,300.
[44:52.84]We're about to wipe Adrian out.
[44:58.22]It's Friday?
[44:58.76]No, I'm talking about like when I was in a bathrobe.
[45:01.66]That was like Sunday afternoon gaming.
[45:14.23]How come he keeps accepting because I think he's good.
[45:16.07]I think he thinks that he's going to win.
[45:17.41]This one actually is kind of tough.
[45:21.46]That's a sharp right turn here.
[45:34.97]Yeah, that is a monster right?
[45:36.57]It's OK.
[45:41.90]Did I get minus points for that?
[45:43.64]Is that considered bad sportsmanship?
[45:44.86]I should have kept the nitrous.
[46:00.28]Big points.
[46:00.76]Catch the drift in the back.
[46:04.22]It's alright.
[46:10.91]As long as I get it straight away, I'm good.
[46:21.67]Plan your attack.
[46:24.70]Plan your course of action.
[46:26.36]There we go.
[46:26.66]Alright.
[46:26.86]Let's take this turn height.
[46:31.40]Better.
[46:35.08]Fuck, I tried to crash my move.
[46:41.30]I'm sorry.
[46:46.19]Alright, this is the last lap going up.
[47:12.41]This is gonna be hard though.
[47:17.48]That turn sucks.
[47:20.68]I gotta catch a lot of ground right now.
[47:22.22]Gonna take this pretty wide.
[47:33.77]That was actually good.
[47:37.07]That was actually good.
[47:46.50]Come on!
[47:49.16]He's got a faster car than I have.
[47:58.78]He's right up my ass.
[48:01.38]Come on!
[48:02.18]That's a 3 for 3.
[48:03.20]3 out of 3.
[48:04.12]Got them all.
[48:23.17]It's not up my ass.
[48:24.07]It's on my ass.
[48:27.51]He's right up my ass.
[48:29.91]He's right on my ass.
[48:31.11]You say it however you want.
[48:32.11]We can all say things a little bit differently.
[48:37.20]I just won every single race.
[48:46.62]Let's see what happens.
[48:50.82]A new respect challenge is available.
[48:52.40]Congratulations.
[48:57.29]Oh, okay.
[48:58.55]I need to repair the car.
[48:59.27]Go earn some cash.
[49:04.24]Okay.
[49:04.80]I get 10 grand.
[49:05.10]Uh, I need to... Where's the garage?
[49:06.16]This thing is beat up.
[49:35.57]I was trying to see.
[49:37.09]What do you mean warning?
[49:41.67]Why is there a train?
[49:51.26]Oh, I think that I think the police actually by just being illegal.
[50:12.94]Okay, apparently this is not illegal.
[50:16.28]What's horn?
[50:23.95]Oh!
[50:34.58]I guess because I bumped him?
[50:43.14]There's two on me!
[50:45.64]What is that billboard?
[50:46.76]What the hell is that?
[50:49.56]That was like a poster that people had on their wall in college.
[50:52.44]They drove by me!
[51:05.51]$350 for committing a traffic violation.
[51:21.76]I thought I could sneak through here, but you can't.
[51:24.70]Alright, I need to get to... Where's the map?
[51:33.04]Whoa, wait a minute.
[51:36.54]Crew meets?
[51:37.68]Go win some cash at the... Oh, wait.
[51:39.50]I can meet up with the crew?
[51:40.46]I kind of want to meet up with the crew.
[52:02.36]Pull over!
[52:03.47]Pull over right now!
[52:04.25]I thought he was gonna drive away from me.
[52:18.71]Wait a minute, hold on.
[52:22.40]I need to know.
[52:23.72]Is there diminishing returns on committing crimes in this universe?
[52:28.12]Like, if I do something, am I just going to be $100?
[52:30.59]Is it going to eventually go to $0?
[52:42.36]Alright, let's test it.
[52:43.48]I need to see.
[52:44.08]We need to know.
[53:19.07]Okay, we're either about to get in trouble or we found gold.
[53:22.33]It does keep going down.
[53:48.44]Okay, so theoretically I could get this to zero.
[53:53.10]Drive behind the car and flash lights to race?
[53:56.30]Wait, what?
[53:57.77]Race me, race me.
[53:59.03]How do I do that?
[54:09.34]Clutch is left shift.
[54:11.18]Oh, I can change view.
[54:14.96]High beam is F. Okay, I can do C. Alright, got it.
[54:25.32]That's actually so much better.
[54:26.22]Okay, what was it?
[54:28.28]It was... What was the button?
[54:30.98]I forgot already.
[54:35.69]Yeah.
[54:37.07]Is he challenging you to a point-to-point race?
[54:38.99]Sure.
[54:39.21]What do you got?
[55:08.19]Get the fuck out of here.
[55:09.33]Oh, thank you.
[55:09.83]In my chat, they put the controls.
[55:31.09]That's good.
[55:35.71]You can't see through this car.
[55:49.66]Literally God is driving this car for me right now.
[55:57.32]Watch the road, I'm watching.
[56:10.93]Ooh.
[56:11.13]I felt a little bit bad about what I just did.
[56:15.20]I felt a little bit bad.
[56:16.86]I had to drive the other way.
[56:20.04]They're so far behind.
[56:21.75]They're so far behind.
[56:22.85]I crashed into a tree.
[56:43.63]How do you drive like this?
[56:45.87]Let's be him.
[56:46.71]I just won.
[56:49.15]Alright, I think I'm satisfied.
[57:10.54]I'm satisfied with this one.
[57:11.90]It was a good hour.
[57:13.74]Wait, there's a highway.
[57:17.87]I think this list deserves a couple of claps.
[57:21.05]Yep, for sure.
[57:22.27]That was fun.
[57:22.95]Let me check this out.
[57:25.91]Is there actually a highway?
[57:37.18]It seems kind of...
[57:40.37]The world seems pretty big.
[57:42.61]What is that?
[57:50.50]Oh no.
[57:51.20]Don't- You gonna do the thing?
[57:52.52]So, you're the new guy around here, huh?
[57:55.14]Thought you'd come see if I wanted to hook up with you, right?
[57:58.16]Well, if you can prove to me you're not all show, then maybe I'll think about it.
[58:03.36]That's not why I came over here, but, um, sure, okay.
[58:05.78]Score the required respect points within the time limit.
[58:08.28]I'm waiting.
[58:09.60]How much time do I have?
[58:10.24]I have one minute?
[58:11.84]Come on, this is fucking cool!
[58:25.24]That's not cool?
[58:27.26]That's not cool enough.
[58:38.40]What's cool?
[58:39.33]What do I have to do to be cool?
[58:42.37]I have 30 seconds to figure it out.
[58:49.11]That was a huge drift.
[58:55.44]How is that not cool?
[58:56.38]That was a huge drift.
[58:58.70]Where is she?
[59:00.28]Okay, 10 seconds.
[59:00.92]What do I do?
[59:10.40]I don't know, flash my lights?
[59:11.30]I don't know.
[59:11.64]I don't understand what I need to do.
[59:13.06]Hold on.
[59:36.79]The hands on the hips thing.
[59:41.35]What do I have to do?
[59:43.51]I need 35 respect points in one minute.
[59:48.82]Did I get any points?
[60:08.70]Go fast on the opposite lane.
[60:15.63]Get some speed first.
[60:19.63]I just drove by her fast.
[60:26.51]That was a near miss, come on.
[60:39.60]Oh, I got four points for... Okay, I get it.
[60:42.68]I get it.
[60:44.58]Nice try, cowboy.
[60:46.26]You come back when you're shooting straight.
[60:50.36]She can't see you if she's down the highway.
[60:52.41]I thought I had to be near her.
[60:53.55]She had to see it.
[60:54.89]Alright, last attempt and then I'm going to take the first break.
[61:00.87]And we'll move on to the next one, which is going to be very interesting.
[61:03.78]Okay, let's go.
[61:09.80]So I gotta do drips, I gotta do- I gotta get air.
[61:11.52]Let me try to do a drip.
[61:13.18]I gotta get off this straight away.
[61:26.25]That was just a regular shit turn.
[61:27.79]Okay, I- How was that not cool?
[61:47.90]I just went up on two wheels!
[62:00.89]That was cool!
[62:02.91]This lady doesn't know what she's talking about.
[62:08.86]Automatic four-wheel drive Andy.
[62:10.26]Is that the problem?
[62:21.89]Automatic, alright, whatever.
[62:25.47]Ah, you're driving a Jetta, that's the problem.
[62:30.73]Well, I can probably get a better car and come back there.
[62:37.97]It said flash me.
[62:42.42]He doesn't want to race anymore.
[62:44.60]Oh, he doesn't want to drive anymore either.
[62:58.86]I thought when I did this, it was gonna go right to the cutscene.
[63:06.91]The last time I did that, when I got near, I just flashed and we went right to a cutscene.
[63:34.09]You're going to play Voices of the Void?
[63:36.63]Yeah.
[63:38.43]I'm kind of holding on to that one for when I really want to just dive into it.
[63:47.56]As I heard, it's one that you want to do.
[63:49.32]So why would these not?
[63:50.44]Come on, you're missing.
[64:08.82]What's the top speed of this thing?
[64:15.10]120?
[64:16.12]Wait, I lost him?
[64:17.42]Oh, it's doing the GTA thing.
[64:22.82]Alright, I'm going to take my break.
[64:28.75]I'll see you.
[64:31.13]See you in a minute.
[64:37.49]Back in three minutes.
[64:44.27]Let's see if it's 100 bucks.
[64:52.79]Come on, ads are going to start.
[64:53.89]Come on!
[64:56.15]What is it?
[64:57.45]Whoa, that's a lot.
[65:00.98]Never mind.
[65:01.86]My theory is wrong.
[65:02.80]See you guys later.
[65:30.78]Thank you.
[67:07.16]Thank you.
[68:01.52]Thank you.
[68:42.88]How's it going?
[69:05.95]Alright, the next one we're going to play.
[69:07.97]I don't know how long we're going to be in the next one because I did open it for a second and it was really, really broken.
[69:16.81]It was all messed up.
[69:17.81]I don't know.
[69:18.21]We'll have to see.
[69:27.22]The one we got coming up is called Venom Codename Outbreak.
[69:33.80]It is a first person shooter.
[69:36.66]And it felt like it was not going to run very well.
[69:45.97]Let me just get it open.
[69:48.05]I'm going to keep it on the BRB screen because when I tried to open this last time, it was pretty painful on the eyes.
[69:55.83]So let me just open it first and then we will switch over.
[70:06.47]I don't know how loud it's going to be either, so just be aware.
[70:11.65]The opening cutscenes do not work.
[70:13.70]I've tried a bunch of stuff to get them to work.
[70:16.14]I have no idea.
[70:22.87]But you should be able to see this.
[70:25.95]How are we doing?
[70:26.39]Can you see it?
[70:47.34]This is not what I was talking about, by the way.
[70:48.86]You'll see.
[70:49.46]No.
[70:49.52]Grenade!
[70:52.24]Watch out!
[70:57.90]Oh, shit!
[70:59.72]Yeah, can't think what's going on with them.
[71:03.01]Alpha Squad, cease fire.
[71:04.77]You have your own guys at that.
[71:15.71]I think it's like it's supposed to be like like predator.
[71:18.27]I don't know.
[71:27.52]Oh my God.
[71:30.67]That's the kind of reaction I'd have.
[71:48.00]How big is this thing?
[71:48.86]Is it invisible?
[71:49.48]Oh, it's like a little thing.
[71:51.60]Oh wait, it's like mind control?
[72:17.48]Oh, okay.
[72:18.10]It took over my brain.
[72:26.79]Okay.
[72:27.29]Oh, God.
[72:28.83]Oh, boy.
[72:30.33]Oh, dear.
[72:32.51]Oh, boy.
[72:32.93]This is all kinds of fucked up.
[72:35.03]Oh, goodness.
[72:38.65]Okay.
[72:39.89]So, this is an issue, as you can tell.
[72:42.78]This is what I saw when I tried to open it for the first time.
[72:47.37]Uh, so, I cannot change, really, any options.
[72:51.63]And I don't even know why I clicked that, because that was a huge mistake.
[72:56.33]I've tried to open this in DX Wind.
[73:00.35]I've tried to open this with, like, a bunch of different shit.
[73:02.43]I was tweaking this for, like, half an hour.
[73:04.91]Uh... I can't even lower the volume, I don't think.
[73:10.48]I don't know where the volume is.
[73:11.62]I think it's game option, graphic option, controls.
[73:15.56]I don't know if there is a volume.
[73:17.30]How are we doing on volume?
[73:18.30]Is it bad?
[73:26.91]It's probably going to be really fucking loud.
[73:30.91]I can see single player.
[73:37.01]Just send it.
[73:45.80]It's an outdated DLL wrapper.
[73:48.38]Oh, shit.
[73:52.30]Okay, I think we just send it and fucking who cares, you know what I mean?
[73:55.12]Like, we're gonna play this game for 15 minutes.
[73:59.47]Here, I can select team.
[74:09.08]Who should I be?
[74:14.34]Okay, I guess I have these two.
[74:21.86]This one, okay, this is a sniper.
[74:25.88]I'm just sending it.
[74:31.41]This looks okay.
[74:32.37]EG Voodoo seems to be commented.
[74:34.25]Okay.
[74:34.67]I think it looks alright.
[75:12.14]Okay, what did we... That sounded like somebody just read phonetic English.
[75:16.34]Do you know what I mean?
[75:16.96]Like, said their lines phonetically?
[75:19.34]Something near the car.
[75:20.56]Oh shit.
[75:20.98]Okay, scout the area.
[75:46.46]Oh shit, it's in his head!
[75:47.24]This thing is in his head!
[75:50.66]Who shot him?
[75:51.02]What?
[75:51.16]We're under attack!
[76:17.10]Alright, I got him.
[76:21.74]Ugh!
[76:28.76]Can I investigate?
[76:32.98]You're not infected too, right?
[76:38.94]What do we do?
[76:39.35]You need to test him?
[76:50.52]This guy's not infected.
[76:52.42]Wait, he's not coming with me.
[76:59.98]Is there like a... Wait, what?
[77:03.20]Wait.
[77:04.18]Oh, for a second I thought he died.
[77:05.31]I was like, what killed you?
[77:07.81]Do I just keep going?
[77:08.63]Okay, damn, list of objectives have been updated.
[77:17.07]Okay, scout the area.
[77:29.68]The stalker devs made this.
[77:31.96]Ah, cool.
[77:34.32]Oh, we got a car up here.
[77:39.02]There's a jump.
[77:42.50]I love the fact that he's just kind of a bag of leaves.
[78:08.57]OK.
[78:12.41]Nothing.
[78:13.93]Do I have to keep this guy alive?
[78:18.06]Scan the area.
[78:19.88]Could be bugs here.
[78:28.67]What is it?
[78:32.37]Wait, is it friendly?
[78:33.69]You friendly?
[78:37.33]Friendly?
[78:42.05]I don't think so.
[78:48.56]What is he saying?
[78:49.48]Oh shit eggs.
[78:55.08]Where where where where?
[79:07.82]Problem?
[79:08.42]What do you need?
[79:10.10]Oh, that fucking hurt more than getting shot!
[79:14.76]Where are you?
[79:15.18]Good?
[79:15.36]Where'd he go?
[79:20.62]I don't know where you are!
[79:23.64]Ow!
[79:25.26]Don't creep up on me like that.
[79:26.70]I think we got it.
[79:41.17]What is he shooting at?
[79:42.13]Alright, is something still in here?
[79:45.31]I think this guy's brain is just fucking fried right now.
[79:49.94]There's nothing here.
[79:50.74]We're just playing music, shooting at nothing.
[79:57.36]The music is so loud.
[80:12.40]Oof.
[80:12.72]That one hurt.
[80:13.76]Oh, oof.
[80:28.86]Information concerning what's happening here.
[80:30.40]Explore the ruins of another block.
[80:31.80]There may be something valuable there.
[80:47.93]I love this game.
[80:51.45]I love hanging out with my friend too.
[80:56.81]You can edit the INI.
[80:57.77]I actually kind of like the crunchiness.
[81:10.44]I can drop the audio at the desktop level here in a second.
[81:14.96]I'm afraid to hit alt tab.
[81:21.33]The UVs on the gun are all fucked up.
[81:22.92]It's see-through.
[81:30.96]I'm gonna die from fall damage and I haven't even... No one's hurt me.
[81:36.79]Am I out of bullets?
[81:43.03]It's just space-age tech, yeah.
[81:44.49]Alright.
[81:46.93]Do I dare?
[81:49.37]Do I dare, uh, hit the alt- hit the Windows key to try to drop the volume by like 30%?
[82:03.08]No.
[82:03.78]Too risky.
[82:05.98]I could save the game.
[82:06.74]I don't think I can.
[82:13.47]Alright, you tell me if it becomes too much of a problem.
[82:18.00]Oh my god, it's actually gonna kill me!
[82:20.06]Alright, there's something apparently in here.
[82:34.34]Don't shoot.
[82:35.48]Please don't shoot.
[82:36.84]I'm not infected.
[82:44.33]Okay.
[82:45.91]How do I do that?
[82:46.81]Follow me, Doc.
[82:47.81]Okay.
[82:49.78]Watch out.
[82:50.10]This guy's not infected.
[82:51.20]Wait.
[82:51.58]Check his head.
[82:52.02]Check him.
[82:52.28]It's clean.
[82:54.74]Come on.
[83:13.41]Is this the thing all over again?
[83:14.67]It kind of feels like it.
[83:22.54]I just... Oh, it's a laser gun!
[83:25.86]Okay, back up.
[83:27.52]Can you hide somewhere, please?
[83:29.00]You're freaking me out.
[83:29.90]You're giving me anxiety.
[83:44.13]There's a bag of leaves.
[83:45.17]I love it.
[83:47.01]Oh shit!
[83:48.37]Music!
[83:48.75]Music!
[84:02.97]Got it!
[84:12.95]This game is 24 years old.
[84:14.65]That's unbelievable.
[84:16.01]Doesn't it feel so weird to see?
[84:17.17]For those of you that are kind of in my age range, it is.
[84:24.86]What did you do?
[84:26.70]Valuable information was lost.
[84:42.79]Who killed that guy?
[84:43.89]I wonder where the... Okay.
[84:57.10]I know what to do, though.
[85:03.91]Shit.
[85:04.83]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[85:05.73]I know where to go.
[85:10.46]I'm gonna speedrun it.
[85:23.55]The menu screen looks old.
[85:24.95]The menu screen looks broken.
[85:33.32]Can I get a different gun?
[85:34.22]I can switch it to laser.
[85:39.94]And then it has to charge?
[85:40.90]I don't think I have anything else besides a live laser submachine gun.
[85:43.84]Oh wait, sniper gun.
[85:50.43]Sniper might be perfect.
[85:57.03]Uh, I'm never unequipping this.
[86:17.46]Call of Duty World at War is retro now.
[86:20.28]Yeah.
[86:22.65]It is crazy.
[86:24.83]It feels really weird to think about that when I was... How old was I?
[86:29.07]Like 17?
[86:30.15]16 or something when this came out?
[86:31.48]17? 17?
[86:42.15]Kill it!
[86:42.47]Kill it!
[86:46.49]Kill it!
[86:48.25]Kill it!
[86:49.20]Shoot it!
[86:50.82]Shoot it!
[86:52.48]Shoot it!
[86:53.34]What are you doing?
[86:54.12]Okay.
[87:08.85]In place search.
[87:11.67]Let's go.
[87:17.39]Final Fantasy 10 is 24 years old.
[87:26.11]What I think is interesting too is.
[87:29.21]Over the last 10 years, graphics have gotten better.
[87:33.28]But not really the magnitude of change that we saw from Super Nintendo to N64.
[87:40.48]From N64 to like PlayStation 3.
[87:45.06]PlayStation 3 to Unreal 5, right?
[87:49.40]I don't know.
[87:51.67]What does the game world look like when... Just listen to this.
[87:56.61]I want to be able to talk.
[87:58.39]Don't look at the screen.
[88:00.28]What happens in 20 or 30 years, as graphics kind of plateau a little bit maybe, I don't know what the next revolution is in graphical fidelity, but it's going to be interesting that when you think about 30 years ago, oh yeah, it was like... If I have people playing trumpets and... That's going to be interesting when 30 years ago is going to be high fidelity shit.
[88:28.83]When you think about old stuff, it has that old kind of in quotes on it.
[88:35.38]It's old.
[88:36.10]It's clunky.
[88:37.64]It's not that put together.
[88:39.20]It's a hundred kilobytes.
[88:42.96]It's going to be really weird when people grow up with incredibly high fidelity things.
[88:47.74]And when they think back to what is old, it will be potentially what is new.
[88:55.20]Crazy.
[89:00.64]Super Mario is going to end up being Beethoven type shit.
[89:06.52]Because when you think about if you grow up with like a really high fidelity graphics, everything is amazing looking.
[89:12.54]It's not really old.
[89:14.48]It's just.
[89:16.34]I don't know how you can describe it.
[89:17.80]Shoot this guy.
[89:19.26]Did he throw his gun?
[89:20.24]Alright, I have to be careful.
[89:24.34]I'll take cover.
[89:32.57]It's a third person though, of course there is.
[89:35.19]And I am not going to use it.
[89:47.94]Where is it?
[89:50.49]No, fuck you.
[89:51.47]I don't want to die.
[89:52.39]What is even hitting us?
[89:53.25]There's somebody behind us.
[90:11.73]Alright, keep this guy alive.
[90:12.55]Alright, let's go.
[90:13.17]Oh shit, it's doing that thing again.
[90:17.26]Get out of the way.
[90:21.60]Sorry, kill him.
[90:41.03]Holy aim!
[90:41.81]No!
[90:42.25]You shot him!
[90:43.58]Alright, I'm gonna move on.
[90:44.82]I have to move on.
[90:45.52]I have to move on.
[90:46.32]This guy's too hard.
[90:47.14]He's doing graphic problems.
[90:48.28]Uh, okay.
[90:56.30]I see how that one is fucking awesome, though.
[91:00.10]I actually really liked it for what it was.
[91:01.85]I've enjoyed that a lot.
[91:03.71]Might not sound like it, but I thought it was great.
[91:08.79]Let me get out of this now.
[91:17.60]Uh oh.
[91:27.08]Hello?
[91:27.76]Okay.
[91:29.94]Uh, the next one is called Dark Rift.
[91:39.37]I think this is a fighting game.
[91:41.65]It looked wild.
[91:48.09]Make sure the volume is at a decent level because all these games are loud.
[91:52.17]So let's just put it there.
[91:55.76]Dark Rift incoming.
[92:03.00]Oops.
[92:09.26]And can you see it?
[92:13.42]Can you see it?
[92:15.97]Yes, you can.
[92:16.71]Okay.
[92:20.73]Now the question is, can I use controller for this one?
[92:24.65]Fucking Zordon.
[92:36.25]The Dark Rift.
[92:37.13]YES!
[93:06.25]I already love it.
[93:08.19]I am so happy.
[93:09.95]They did, I told you they did this shit 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[93:13.04]Bring this back.
[93:13.94]Bring it back.
[93:16.90]Make me excited to play your game.
[93:18.60]Make me excited to see the title pop up.
[93:20.24]What is this bullshit nowadays?
[93:22.86]Bring this back immediately.
[93:29.20]Okay, how about, uh, I guess I have a controller in my hand.
[93:32.16]It seems to work.
[93:38.36]I'm going to be... Okay.
[93:41.08]I didn't press any buttons.
[93:44.28]It picked this guy for me.
[94:12.11]That's got a long ass intro.
[94:17.71]Oh wait, we're going.
[94:19.65]Gore versus Zen Murren.
[94:33.22]Alright, I feel it.
[94:36.42]This is a grab too.
[94:37.06]Okay, let's get a grab.
[94:43.82]Can't grab?
[94:50.52]It's a Mortal Kombat clone?
[94:52.36]This is not a Mortal Kombat clone!
[94:54.46]I'm gonna beat this whole game right now.
[95:03.80]With gore.
[95:11.11]Good guarding.
[95:20.37]dominated again oh it's best that free to wait that's a three wait alright he woke up jump attacks
[95:41.73]I'm not gonna lie, this game's fun.
[95:44.33]I am not lying to you.
[95:45.35]This is fun.
[95:49.90]I can see suddenly, you know, turn it up with the boys and the big bowl of popcorn in the middle.
[95:59.40]Okay, Nikki.
[96:03.29]I kind of want to get the intro for everybody else.
[96:07.91]They went off on like a four paragraph wall of text about my life.
[96:24.01]I'm that dickhead that does this in Smash Bros.
[96:39.71]Bring it on.
[96:51.00]Start with the grab.
[96:56.88]Protect that guard.
[96:58.80]Up and over.
[97:02.49]Good.
[97:03.33]Switching directions up.
[97:04.87]Walk.
[97:06.03]Walking.
[97:07.11]Grab.
[97:07.87]Grabbing.
[97:14.77]I gotta get like a better combo going.
[97:17.63]There we go.
[97:31.78]Okay, you can do Street Fighter type moves.
[97:38.89]That was a good uppercut.
[97:43.92]Always go for the grab if you're up against the pressure zone.
[97:47.10]I don't know, shut up.
[98:04.94]I'm trying to do moves.
[98:13.44]I gotta keep my flawless streak up.
[98:23.23]I'm trying to do like a Hadouken.
[98:36.35]Of course you're a gore main.
[98:39.99]Gore versus Demonica.
[98:44.30]Oh, that's a good combo, hold on.
[98:51.04]Oh fuck, I'm in trouble.
[99:03.99]Get that out of here.
[99:14.03]Fuck.
[99:15.75]No!
[99:16.01]Alright, first loss.
[99:21.29]I hate losing the first hit.
[99:31.38]I could do way more blocking and this is where it actually just became real.
[99:41.15]Get out of here with this shift change shit!
[99:50.36]Good.
[100:11.87]That was legendary blocking, by the way.
[100:18.17]No!
[100:25.96]Start off with that every time.
[100:27.86]Chump.
[100:28.22]That's a chump move.
[100:44.09]No!
[100:45.57]You're doing the grab spam?
[100:46.97]How do you feel about that?
[100:48.25]I added, like, seven words to your sentence.
[100:52.77]I added, how do you feel about that?
[100:54.03]Like, why?
[101:06.40]Did you?
[101:08.24]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[101:11.56]I got it, I got it.
[101:13.03]Fuck.
[101:16.19]I don't even have a move list.
[101:44.10]Am I gonna play this like Elden Ring?
[101:50.68]Ah, jumped over me.
[102:08.85]Yeah, I just got so much smarter.
[102:18.27]He's doing combos and springing together moves.
[102:20.69]I don't know any of my moves.
[102:24.01]I can reach with him.
[102:45.70]You can't beat it.
[102:46.76]Yeah, and it gets to a point where you cannot win in a fighting game using the I'm 11 strategy.
[102:53.35]And the I'm 11 strategy is, I know there are four buttons.
[102:57.27]I know hitting this yellow one makes me go like that.
[103:01.19]I know that if I hit this green one, it makes me go like that.
[103:05.71]Doesn't work anymore when you get to a certain level.
[103:09.18]You can do the 11-year-old strategy.
[103:11.58]Like, oh, this green one, when I press it twice, it does that.
[103:13.76]And if I press the green one twice, and then the yellow one, it wants to start having other movements.
[103:20.72]That's GG.
[103:21.68]Get up.
[103:21.92]Get up.
[103:40.88]What is this fucking horse shit?
[103:41.98]Just get him!
[103:50.15]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[103:51.51]Turn it back on.
[103:55.84]Fuck.
[103:58.02]Yeah, you start with that shit every time.
[104:04.30]By the way, my connection to this guy is so bad, too.
[104:06.26]I'm so fucking annoyed.
[104:07.06]I'm playing somebody from, like, fucking Japan right now or something.
[104:12.32]My ping is, like, 300 or 400.
[104:13.08]I thought they fucking fixed this, like, two or three patches ago.
[104:19.22]I selected NA.
[104:20.56]I selected NA West.
[104:22.93]That's so annoying.
[104:25.57]I'm pressing these and it's happening two or three seconds, like, at least a second later.
[104:34.29]you're on wi-fi that's a myth I'm gonna lose alright let me restart battle commence he went down last time that's so annoying
[105:06.81]You need to give up?
[105:08.41]Shut up!
[105:08.77]He's got so much more stronger damage than I do!
[105:17.44]Alright guys, I'm playing as Green Thanos, okay?
[105:22.40]Where's my power?
[105:27.32]I would have picked Green Thanos in the beginning?
[105:29.81]No, I would have picked, um... I don't know, the guy that was making the slime.
[105:35.19]I saw him for one second on the screen.
[105:43.73]I'm so slow!
[105:48.39]What the fuck was that?
[106:23.20]no I was bringing it back too much what the timer continue alright last ride I'm done
[106:52.41]I learned a new combo.
[106:57.80]Oh my god, this sidestep dogshit.
[107:10.41]Does he know the game is at x3 speed?
[107:14.47]What are you talking about?
[107:15.15]What do you mean the game is at 3x speed?
[107:23.73]Are you serious?
[107:28.27]No, it feels pretty clean.
[107:31.56]The timer is fast.
[107:34.06]Wait.
[107:36.22]Wait, this is wicked fast.
[107:37.64]This is wicked fast.
[107:40.04]Wait, why is it in times three speed?
[107:45.21]No, you're full of shit.
[107:46.41]I think that's just the way that old games were.
[107:52.04]Am I actually playing at x5 speed?
[107:54.14]I'm playing pretty damn good for somebody playing at x3 speed.
[108:07.99]Oh my god, he just dialed on me.
[108:14.82]It's probably locked to the frame rate.
[108:17.32]Oh shit.
[108:19.83]the intro was normal the and here is gore and he loves hockey and he likes to go on long walks that was not times three speed you need to cap your FPS uh big deal going on right now
[108:54.73]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[109:05.88]What the fuck?!
[109:08.00]Yes!
[109:12.50]I just looked up gameplay, this is so fast!
[109:15.38]Battle commence!
[109:19.41]Yeah, this is how the pros play it.
[109:22.61]We don't waste any time.
[109:44.72]Come on, I gotta get him.
[109:46.48]Ah, fuck this.
[109:47.16]Alright, I'm out of here.
[109:48.17]This game is fun, but ah, fuck this.
[109:53.75]One more, one more, one more, one more.
[110:14.42]I can't believe I didn't see anything wrong with this.
[110:17.18]I thought it was just normal.
[110:49.33]I can't leave the game.
[110:50.07]Oh, there we go.
[110:56.26]I was flying at times five speed.
[110:58.16]A lot of old timers that I actually wait, is it actually that fast?
[111:14.90]It was way slower.
[111:17.30]Yeah.
[111:19.62]That's so funny.
[111:23.64]Okay.
[111:25.86]I still enjoyed my time in it.
[111:27.12]I still had fun.
[111:30.54]Okay, the next one is called Perfect Weapon.
[111:37.93]Perfect Weapon.
[111:47.27]I will show it to you in just a second.
[112:00.62]Can't see anything yet.
[112:02.04]I'm really glad I turned that down.
[112:03.30]OK, what we got?
[112:12.56]Can you see?
[112:13.04]Hold on, let me wait for the splash screens go by first.
[112:22.61]Hang out for a second.
[112:27.70]Because sometimes they... Here we go.
[112:45.67]Game name is Perfect Weapon.
[112:58.19]Okay, you think that a guy that was a fighter like that would... Screenshots may vary by platform.
[113:09.23]Screenshots may vary by platform.
[113:18.98]Oh, okay.
[113:19.90]This is a controller game, maybe.
[113:21.70]Uh, I... Hold on.
[113:32.52]Okay, up, down, left, right, jump.
[113:35.76]Crouch is shift.
[113:37.56]And this punches and kicks.
[113:39.02]A, S, Z. A, S, Z, X, F, N. Okay.
[113:44.63]Just in case the controller doesn't work.
[113:48.33]This is times three speed.
[113:49.33]Hey, this is, by the way, this is considered one of the worst games of all time.
[113:58.83]Alright.
[114:00.15]Looking forward to it.
[114:01.04]Okay.
[114:01.38]Okay, what do I do?
[114:44.25]Oh shit, okay.
[114:45.15]Do I have to fight these wolves?
[115:01.18]It doesn't matter how much martial arts training you have, a fucking wolf is gonna kill you.
[115:08.49]Oh shit, I did it.
[115:09.33]Hold on.
[115:17.60]Okay, what is this thing?
[115:18.72]Does this get energy?
[115:23.04]Experience points?
[115:23.98]I don't know.
[115:24.32]Which way do I go?
[115:26.62]I'll go down.
[115:33.51]Okay, hold on.
[115:34.15]That's right punch.
[115:35.31]Okay, this is left punch, left kick.
[115:39.31]Right kick.
[115:41.39]Right punch.
[115:42.27]No.
[115:44.08]That's jump.
[115:45.90]This is crouch.
[115:47.28]That's all I know how to do.
[115:55.55]This controls so badly, by the way.
[115:58.31]The dog's just itching his head.
[116:02.79]Can I just avoid him?
[116:05.05]Doesn't even look... He looks friendly.
[116:08.65]Like there's a guy now.
[116:23.53]Dude, that's great.
[116:28.95]Okay, hold on.
[116:32.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:33.81]I can't die.
[116:37.88]I'm slowly losing health.
[116:39.10]I think it's because it's cold out.
[116:51.15]I gotta go, I'm losing health.
[116:53.22]The satellite dish.
[117:04.54]This is just like, cruel.
[117:05.76]Will you just kick him already, please?
[117:18.81]Okay, what is it showing me?
[117:29.07]What the fuck do I do?
[117:29.81]How do I get this off the screen?
[117:38.10]I want to go into normal mode.
[117:39.36]There we go.
[117:39.76]Okay.
[117:42.48]Okay, norm... Normal mode is just slower.
[117:46.48]It's slower walking and slower running.
[117:51.96]You can only jump if you're in fight mode.
[117:53.46]What are you doing?
[118:01.37]No, run!
[118:01.93]Walk normally!
[118:03.43]Walk normally!
[118:19.07]Oh shit, fight mode!
[118:19.77]Fight, fight, fight!
[118:29.25]He didn't even die!
[118:32.37]Why'd he do that?
[118:41.01]He's still alive.
[118:43.97]How do I do a leg sweep?
[118:56.44]Okay.
[118:57.96]Going good so far.
[118:59.14]How do I get this overlay off the screen?
[119:12.39]You can't?
[119:14.75]Is it tab?
[119:15.39]Oh, it is tab.
[119:28.57]Okay, that's a dead end.
[119:29.33]Where have I not gone?
[119:35.39]I love how he runs for two seconds and then stops.
[119:46.30]Like, why are you running for one second?
[120:01.77]It's tank controls, but also not tank controls.
[120:04.31]It is painful.
[120:06.27]Can you please mute the music as part of the experience?
[120:11.43]I can't.
[120:17.27]Ooh, item.
[120:29.25]We need to get out of the ice level.
[120:34.15]rocket ship part okay that alright so we got to go okay I got to go up and then to the left I think I have no idea I don't know where the hell the game wants me to go no way no go to the big glowing blue temple yeah we have to explore everything else
[121:02.96]Alright, we're gonna be in this one for a little while.
[121:05.56]For sure.
[121:06.27]Without doubt.
[121:11.71]Alright, big temple.
[121:13.49]It's a big part of the game here.
[121:29.18]It took so long to get over here.
[121:33.64]Where am I?
[121:34.02]Okay, let's go.
[121:36.90]Alright, there's a lot of enemies on the screen, everybody.
[121:47.49]Good.
[121:55.78]Can I have a cut too?
[122:03.02]I have not saved the game.
[122:04.00]I don't even know how.
[122:16.61]Does he have a gun?
[122:24.79]Wow, I just won two- I just- I windshield wipered that guy's head.
[122:37.36]Elf?
[122:38.74]Alright, which way should I go?
[122:39.46]This way?
[122:54.38]The dog is just mauling that guy.
[123:08.59]What's going on?
[123:13.81]I don't want to fight these guys.
[123:21.07]But let's go.
[123:23.15]Yeah, block that.
[123:40.03]Alright, I'm coming up on a break.
[123:42.71]Uh... Unfortunately, I have to leave you with this music because I cannot... Tabbing this game I think would be a disaster.
[124:01.32]Ooh, look at that health.
[124:09.15]No way.
[124:20.05]Wait, hold on a second.
[124:25.10]That's not in my head.
[124:33.30]I thought that high pitch sound was in my head.
[124:36.10]I thought it would that because I get I have a little bit of ringing in my left ear.
[124:39.97]That's in the game.
[124:44.23]Holy shit.
[124:45.33]OK, yeah, I thought that was in my head.
[124:51.35]There we go.
[124:56.40]I genuinely thought that was... Why is that in my head?
[124:58.60]Alright, beer beat.
[125:07.16]It's good now, right?
[125:16.03]Okay.
[125:17.85]I'll be back after the ads.
[125:19.01]See you guys in a few minutes.
[125:22.45]That's crazy, though.
[125:23.33]I really thought that was just in my own head.
[125:26.82]I'm looking over at me and I'm like, dude, turn it off, turn it off.
[125:29.00]I'm like, what?
[125:29.46]What's wrong with it?
[125:30.06]Be right back.
[129:37.20]Hello.
[129:39.56]I'm going to grab another snack.
[129:42.11]It'll be like another minute or two, maybe.
[133:27.95]Okie dokie, I am back.
[133:30.77]I am ready.
[133:31.35]Yeah, so OK, if I turn the music all the way down, will it still be there?
[133:36.36]That's the question.
[133:38.98]Let me open up my bush light.
[134:14.03]It's a soda, I'm just kidding.
[134:14.97]Alright, so... Yeah, I really thought that that shit was in my head.
[134:19.73]Okay, so let's do a test then.
[134:23.16]If I go like this... So, can you hear it?
[134:28.72]If I go like here... Like really low?
[134:42.36]Oh, what if I hold on a second?
[134:43.82]Oops.
[134:52.72]Okay, sorry.
[134:53.34]Alright, let's see what happens.
[134:57.65]Can you still hear it?
[135:07.75]Not really.
[135:08.09]What about now?
[135:20.15]Wait, I was hearing an IRL noise.
[135:21.83]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[135:23.22]I was like, wait, what am I hearing?
[135:28.28]This is one of the most well-documented, well-reported shitty games of all time.
[135:37.83]Okay, so I gotta go... Where am I going?
[135:39.17]This way?
[135:42.97]No way.
[135:51.67]Am I going the right way?
[135:52.47]I have no idea.
[135:53.53]No, no, no.
[135:55.53]Am I?
[135:55.79]I forgot where I was going after I just ate like a fucking... I just put a chicken cutlet in my mouth.
[136:04.92]No, I think this is correct.
[136:12.23]You're the professional.
[136:20.12]It's kind of quiet now.
[136:22.00]Yeah, well, I don't want to hear that sound either.
[136:24.78]So it's going to stay on.
[136:26.50]We're keeping it low.
[136:28.08]Oh shit, here we go.
[136:30.08]What the hell was that?
[136:41.46]Somebody said I've played this before.
[136:43.22]I've played this before?
[136:44.52]When?
[136:47.84]I have no memory of playing this.
[136:50.42]In 2018?
[136:50.50]No, I did not.
[137:13.37]You said that you loved it.
[137:14.65]I didn't.
[137:16.21]There's no way I played this.
[137:17.37]I would remember some of this.
[137:25.23]You did.
[137:25.57]You played it in 2018.
[137:26.93]You did.
[137:33.39]You have a full three-hour YouTube video.
[137:36.37]What?! !
[137:43.59]I can crouch.
[137:47.51]Run and jump.
[137:48.10]I don't even know how I did that before.
[137:49.76]What the fuck?
[137:50.66]This is insane.
[137:51.72]No way.
[137:53.12]I've played this like eight years ago.
[137:56.40]I don't remember this at all.
[138:00.52]No, that's not a jump.
[138:04.10]How far did I get?
[138:10.66]Wait a second.
[138:11.30]Wait a second.
[138:11.84]Hold on.
[138:12.42]Everybody relax.
[138:24.21]I want to see something.
[138:24.97]This is very important to me.
[138:31.30]Hold on.
[138:34.76]This is incredibly important.
[138:51.36]I want to watch a little bit of this, and I want to see.
[138:54.31]Remember, I've told you guys this a few times, but when you play games, I've played so many games over the last, let's call it, decade, that when you see shit like this, it's genuinely unbelievable.
[139:13.04]This is unbelievable.
[139:13.76]This video was uploaded like fucking eight years ago, seven years ago.
[139:24.06]Run and jump?
[139:24.64]I don't even know how I did that before.
[139:27.44]I think it's because it looks so different because it was PlayStation 1.
[139:30.74]It's even crustier.
[139:35.76]This is, I felt like I, okay, I felt like I was on like a drug trip when I played this or something.
[139:40.45]Because I do not, if you told me, hey, I'll pay you a million dollars if you get this right.
[139:45.33]Did you play this before?
[139:46.05]I'd say, no, of course not.
[139:48.27]Eat them?
[139:48.71]I don't think I can eat them.
[139:51.57]How does it play out?
[139:52.31]Has anybody ever played this game?
[139:56.61]Apparently me.
[139:57.47]Apparently I did.
[139:58.21]I think so, right?
[140:01.39]You'd assume.
[140:03.61]Is the high-pitched whine in this one?
[140:09.54]I can't tell.
[140:11.98]Well, I guess I'm going to live out the rest of my life.
[140:19.72]I want to see if it plays out the same way.
[140:20.90]Do I say the same jokes?
[140:21.70]Do I say the same thing?
[140:29.97]I don't understand.
[140:30.87]I wish I knew what the fuck was happening.
[140:31.97]Okay, that's pretty accurate.
[140:34.11]The edge here, it decides to play the dance music.
[140:38.50]No way.
[140:40.26]You should play this again.
[140:41.74]Is there a jump?
[140:42.52]Eight years.
[140:43.04]Is there a combination I can do?
[140:47.16]We can't hear it?
[140:49.31]The camera moves as fast as you do.
[140:54.59]Look at the map.
[140:55.49]Looks like I can go over here.
[140:58.32]The map is different though.
[140:59.70]Hold on.
[141:00.24]Give me a little bit of slack.
[141:01.48]The map is different.
[141:03.16]It looks... The one we just played is a lot less crunchy.
[141:06.12]There has to be something I can do.
[141:08.40]There has to be.
[141:10.20]How did I jump over him last time?
[141:11.38]What was the combination?
[141:15.58]Wait.
[141:16.65]There's a very high probability that I just quit the game.
[141:20.48]And I get frustrated and I say, fuck this one.
[141:25.31]What is this?
[141:25.99]What am I looking at?
[141:27.01]Select?
[141:27.73]I might just quit the game right here.
[141:32.51]Look, it's showing me this now.
[141:34.79]And you just keep saying, no way.
[141:35.96]I have to be able to get on these rocks.
[141:40.96]No way.
[141:42.14]No way.
[141:44.12]Okay.
[141:45.08]Okay.
[141:45.54]I...
[141:48.77]He keeps saying, no way, but then he doesn't.
[141:51.66]You can't even hear the audio.
[141:54.20]Get over there.
[141:56.86]Oh my god, please.
[141:58.64]No, no, don't go.
[142:00.12]Why is he walking across this?
[142:01.80]Your voice is different.
[142:10.39]Ten years have gone by.
[142:15.71]Alright.
[142:16.23]It's been seven and a half, almost eight years.
[142:17.89]Yeah, I aged.
[142:23.45]You can tell I hate it, too.
[142:24.41]You can tell I hate it.
[142:34.94]Yeah, this is probably an old microphone, too.
[142:36.66]How do I stop from jumping?
[142:39.14]Get over there.
[142:40.64]Oh, my God.
[142:48.13]I did it!
[142:49.03]I made it over here!
[142:52.56]Now what do I do?
[142:54.40]Jesus!
[142:55.76]That was funny.
[143:01.48]Fight!
[143:02.10]Fight!
[143:03.34]Oh my fucking god.
[143:05.20]I'm gonna lose.
[143:12.26]Do I quit?
[143:14.40]We didn't see this.
[143:29.73]Now that I know what to do let me just get over there.
[143:32.51]Okay, but do I though?
[143:37.15]This music is the music is perfect.
[143:39.54]No, we'll give that I just quit I
[143:47.14]Why do I quit?
[143:48.04]I need to hear the reason.
[143:51.91]This one's going to be terrible.
[143:56.53]This is a classic.
[143:57.37]We're going to keep the classic of good games for later.
[144:01.93]What is this?
[144:06.05]Oh, man.
[144:07.79]Yeah.
[144:08.69]This one is a guaranteed 10 minutes.
[144:10.74]That's a different menu, too.
[144:12.10]Look at how different the menu is.
[144:14.55]Not far yet.
[144:15.51]Venture.
[144:16.26]I know what to do now.
[144:21.18]Why can I not select anything?
[144:26.66]I'm pretty sure this is a sign.
[144:28.27]Because it will not let... Alright, moving on.
[144:31.09]Wow.
[144:31.71]You gotta be kidding me.
[144:32.75]That's unbelievable.
[144:34.03]I thought that my computer just fucking crashed.
[144:36.95]In like real life.
[144:38.90]Alright.
[144:40.98]Here we go.
[144:42.94]Alright, uh... Well, I think that's a sign.
[144:46.98]I think that's a sign that we should probably move on from that one.
[144:50.00]That was called Perfect Weapon.
[144:52.70]And... Yeah, I think we should probably move on.
[144:55.85]I think that's a pretty good sign.
[144:56.73]Alright, um... What's next after that?
[145:04.19]I feel like I just... I feel like I... I don't know.
[145:07.89]When you play so many things, you see so many things.
[145:11.76]How about this one?
[145:12.48]This one is called... Ah, do I, do I just, do I go into this one?
[145:21.91]This one could, we could be here for a while.
[145:23.42]It's a Dracula game.
[145:25.08]Yeah, fuck it, let's do it.
[145:26.70]This one's called Veil of Darkness.
[145:37.42]Let's adjust the volume, because this one is probably pretty crunchy.
[145:41.14]If I need to back out, I will.
[145:42.92]Please tell me if it sucks.
[145:44.48]If the audio is bad, definitely let me know.
[145:46.02]Because that's the problem with these old games.
[145:50.03]Yeah, that's painful.
[145:54.29]That's the brown noise.
[145:58.93]Oh my god!
[146:00.46]Okay, stop!
[146:04.78]You played this one too?! !
[146:13.75]No, I didn't play this one.
[146:14.79]I would've remembered this.
[146:20.77]Have I played every video game and we're just looping back around ten years later?
[146:27.79]You also quit this one, too.
[146:34.81]Jesus!
[146:35.67]And if the... Wait, what?
[146:36.91]This is insane!
[146:41.44]No, you guys can do that to me with every- Okay, this has to- The audio has to come down.
[146:45.08]Hold on a second, guys.
[146:46.10]I'm sorry.
[146:50.96]That's gonna give my brain some trouble.
[146:53.77]That's better.
[146:57.15]No, you guys can now say that with every video game now.
[146:59.41]And it's just not gonna be true.
[147:06.19]Okay, I think that's me.
[147:16.46]Okay, I just got grabbed.
[147:17.56]Veil of Darkness.
[147:18.56]1993.
[147:23.92]This frame rate... Okay, the last frame rate we had was times 3?
[147:30.51]Are we sure this is not, like, .03?
[147:33.61]You've flown your small cargo plane through just about everything.
[147:42.65]A flight over the dreaded Carpathian Mountains, deep within the heart of ancient Romania, was of little concern.
[147:55.44]You do not even see the danger lurking within the sickly green hue of the sky or the darkening clouds.
[148:03.68]Unfortunately, you have not gone unseen.
[148:05.96]Evil unknown to the modern-day world watches from the mist-enshrouded valley below.
[148:09.66]From his stomach, apparently.
[148:17.38]Where is this crystal ball coming from?
[148:24.07]Okay.
[148:35.34]What, does he cause like a plane crash or something?
[148:37.30]I don't get it.
[148:38.76]Or was he just flipping channels?
[148:41.06]Tingling creeps up at the back of your neck as you are engulfed in a cold chill.
[148:49.24]Suddenly, all the gauges begin to spin out of control.
[149:04.17]Struggling, you barely manage to pull your plane out of the dive.
[149:07.17]Oh, so we're fine.
[149:08.47]He was just fucking with us.
[149:16.69]I guess that's annoying to him, apparently.
[149:28.86]Go, Batch.
[149:29.58]Go fuck with him.
[149:32.24]Why can't he just do it?
[149:33.24]He just did it before?
[149:38.87]We just crashed into them!
[149:40.55]No, they weren't destroyed by the bats.
[149:42.67]I crashed into them.
[149:43.35]This guy's a fucking asshole.
[149:57.03]Amazed that you are still alive, you stagger from the wreckage.
[150:09.05]The last of your strength wanes as you fall to the Earth, unconscious, helpless, as unknown hands reach out to grasp you.
[150:26.99]Do I?
[150:27.13]Okay
[150:57.40]Do I have to do something?
[151:08.12]Fable.
[151:10.66]My head.
[151:11.06]I feel like I was just slammed by a speeding truck.
[151:16.97]I'm a little dizzy, too.
[151:19.75]Perhaps you should lie back down.
[151:21.11]Father said it's a miracle that you're even alive.
[151:24.15]Nah, I'll be alright.
[151:27.27]who are you where the hell am I last thing I remember father will explain everything he asked to see you as soon as you regained consciousness as for my name it's deirdre and you are my name is one I guess you should take me to your father we don't want to keep him waiting do we
[151:52.79]Father wishes to speak to you alone, so you'd better go by yourself.
[151:55.75]I'll stay here and tidy up a bit.
[151:58.57]You can find Father in his study.
[152:00.24]Just go down the stairs in the hall, through the first door to your right, and enter the room straight across the first floor hall.
[152:07.26]I would appreciate if you wrote it down, because hold on.
[152:10.10]Down the stairs in the hall, through the... Okay, down the stairs, through the first door to my right, and then straight across the first floor hall.
[152:21.80]down the hall down this hold on down the stairs through the first door on the right downstairs first on the right straight through thanks I'm sure I'll find my way maybe after I get some answers we'll have a chance to talk some more I would like that but knowing father he'll leave you little time to flirt with his only daughter why am I coughing
[152:53.42]Nothing to hit?
[152:54.14]Okay, there's a punch.
[152:59.00]You'd better not keep father waiting.
[153:00.18]He's most anxious to talk to you.
[153:06.25]Why aren't we the violent one?
[153:07.91]You can punch people.
[153:12.79]Oh, fuck.
[153:13.16]Give me that.
[153:17.98]Okay, wait.
[153:18.36]It's equipped.
[153:18.78]How do I unequip it?
[153:23.34]I'm just holding the knife!
[153:25.22]Okay, how do I, uh... Nothing to take, nothing to take.
[153:41.25]Okay, I'm just gonna leave.
[153:45.91]I just threw the knife!
[153:48.97]Okay, this game's gonna be cool.
[153:51.35]I get it.
[153:53.69]Would you like to play this game with full, simplified, or easy combat?
[153:56.88]I'm probably going to say simplified.
[153:58.08]Okay, by the way, no, you haven't.
[154:01.96]I'm going to Cream Corn, who is a resident expert.
[154:07.76]If the resident expert says I haven't played this, then I definitely haven't.
[154:11.13]Full?
[154:11.69]No!
[154:12.07]It's probably going to be impossible.
[154:23.02]Easy.
[154:23.28]It's not worth it.
[154:23.96]I'll just do simplified.
[154:32.21]This is an old game.
[154:32.97]It's probably going to be hard.
[154:33.79]Alright.
[154:35.79]There are like eight doors.
[154:36.83]Down the stairs.
[154:44.97]Wait.
[154:45.47]Is this somebody I need to talk to?
[154:49.34]So I've heard.
[154:55.46]I believe he's waiting for me.
[154:57.24]Yes, he is.
[154:57.70]So please don't keep him waiting.
[154:58.82]Mr. Kristoffergic is a very busy man.
[155:02.89]Bye.
[155:12.79]Why can't I type?
[155:13.47]Bye.
[155:14.33]Alright, first door on the right.
[155:20.90]And then... straight across?
[155:25.42]Is this him?
[155:25.84]No, I haven't.
[155:29.04]Nor have I ever seen such a machine.
[155:49.26]Sir, or airplane.
[155:49.82]Airplane.
[155:50.28]I would appreciate it if someone could show me where I crashed.
[155:53.84]I would like to take a look at my plane.
[156:07.11]Sure.
[156:07.23]How could I say no?
[156:08.87]Your daughter quite possibly saved my life.
[156:10.61]What do you want me to do?
[156:30.64]Some time ago, I lent a fine carpenter's hammer to a fellow villager.
[156:33.83]Good tools are hard to come by in the valley, and Edward hasn't made an effort to return the hammer to me.
[156:40.73]Would you go to him and get the tool?
[156:42.06]I would ask Ivan to do this, but there are many more important duties to which he must attend.
[156:48.71]Okay.
[156:49.83]Don't call me that.
[156:50.43]I never liked it when people called me sir.
[156:52.97]My name is One.
[156:53.59]Forgive my lack of manners.
[156:54.31]My name's... Kirill.
[157:23.24]I hope we get another music track.
[157:25.98]Because I don't know how much longer I can take the... I gotta get Hammer from the town.
[157:40.36]I would love to know how to get out of here.
[157:46.06]Wait, should I talk to him?
[157:48.78]Mr. Kruzovich is in the study if you wish to speak with him.
[157:53.11]That may be true.
[157:55.49]Nevertheless, spend the coins wisely.
[158:32.07]This track is worse.
[158:40.58]What's wrong with the tone?
[158:49.51]This track is scratching my brain.
[158:51.37]It really is.
[159:03.46]Nothing to take.
[159:09.92]Sound of a plugged in head- oh shit, there's blood here.
[159:12.81]Porn fabric.
[159:20.21]Nothing to take.
[159:26.07]Ah, I can't take it anymore.
[159:27.13]How do I- how do I turn the music off?
[159:42.18]The disk options menu?
[159:43.82]Hold on.
[159:44.42]Let me turn this off.
[159:52.08]It's a dying Tamagotchi.
[159:53.49]Fuck, I want to play this one too.
[159:54.57]It's just this hurts.
[159:58.71]What if I drop the volume by a lot?
[160:08.57]It's too much.
[160:09.43]I can't.
[160:12.72]I have to exit this game.
[160:13.58]I have to get out.
[160:14.44]I can't lower it any more than this.
[160:19.68]I just force quit the game.
[160:20.52]I had to.
[160:27.65]I actually was interested in that one too, but I can't take the tinnitus music.
[160:37.43]Dude, what the hell?
[160:42.16]Okay.
[160:44.09]Don't worry, we got plenty more.
[160:45.09]It sounded like it was broken.
[160:51.63]Get the no audio patch.
[160:58.35]Okay, the next one coming up is called Cyclones.
[161:01.83]Uh, this one has FMV in it.
[161:03.47]That's why I was interested.
[161:05.12]Even if it's just the opening cutscene, I don't care.
[161:08.32]We're gonna enjoy it together.
[161:11.38]Let's get the audio in a good level.
[161:14.68]And let's see how it goes.
[161:22.05]It's kind of loud.
[161:26.09]Let me fix that.
[161:39.99]Okay.
[161:40.54]Should be much better.
[161:50.28]presents a Raven Software game.
[161:54.26]Raven Software?
[161:55.04]Why do I know that?
[161:56.20]Why have I heard that?
[162:05.17]Yeah, this one is C-Y-C-L-O-N-E-S.
[162:08.83]Cyclones.
[162:09.51]Mother Earth.
[162:10.79]Since the dawn of life, she has protected her children from the ravages of a hostile universe.
[162:17.45]Until six months ago.
[162:21.38]At that time all Earth learned what the lunatic fringe had been insisting for years We are not alone in the universe We were about to receive our first open visit from creatures who have been secretly studying our planet for decades And let me guess they're fucking hostile I can't wait till aliens land and they just want to like share their wheat recipes with us
[162:50.36]No, they're destroying the planet.
[162:51.48]They're just shooting lasers at it.
[162:54.10]Destroy everything.
[162:54.95]Kill all humans.
[163:03.65]What does an alien race gain from destroying all of our buildings?
[163:06.73]You know what I mean?
[163:07.27]Like, I don't get it.
[163:21.44]Because they're doing it for fun.
[163:24.72]Who is that?
[163:28.68]That is like... Wait, are these... Part perfect ass.
[164:01.96]Okay.
[164:04.46]Ooh, quick reflexes on the Cyclone.
[164:14.72]Sidearm.
[164:18.59]It's like somebody's really shitty Robocop costume.
[164:25.35]Okay, this is... Here we go.
[164:26.43]Cyclones.
[164:27.91]1994.
[164:27.95]Strategic Simulations.
[164:33.79]Welcome to AI Central Command, Havoc.
[164:36.55]I've read all of your test specifications and technical results, and I'm looking forward to getting you into action.
[164:42.98]I'm Catherine Hayes, Director of Operations and Chief Strategist for Advanced Idea Corporation.
[164:49.08]I assume your beta programming has prepared you for the level of performance that I will demand.
[164:54.39]Let me introduce my staff.
[164:56.73]This is Commander Trevor Shane.
[164:59.13]The most decorated soldier in this or any other theater of war.
[165:03.29]Commander Shane is AI's weapons and- Is that a bunch of camo panels behind her?
[165:08.68]Communications and intelligence officer will be your eyes and ears.
[165:12.60]Call me Dee Dee.
[165:13.84]If that's alright with Director Hayes.
[165:18.10]A target droid?
[165:20.78]Cyclones will chew them up and spit them back in our faces.
[165:25.59]I'm not willing to entrust more lives-
[165:29.10]He's supposed to be in a costume.
[165:30.66]He's supposed to be in a costume with a bunch of, like, white hair, and he's supposed to be, like, an old general.
[165:34.12]They just didn't get a costume.
[165:35.38]Havoc was designed to infiltrate places and accomplish missions that no squad of humans would have a prayer of.
[165:42.06]Your terminals are clear to review Havoc's technical and test reports.
[165:46.26]Our job is to provide Havoc mission briefings and support.
[165:50.01]This is a little-ass room, too.
[165:51.57]Commence phase one briefing for codename Lost and Found.
[165:56.94]This mission will separate the men from the... whatever.
[166:02.65]Havoc unit will be phase-shifted to coordinates Alpha-Bravo 100-100.
[166:06.33]And once penetration of the outer walls has been achieved, Havoc unit will conduct a search and destroy sweep of the area.
[166:16.74]All enemy combatants encountered will be neutralized.
[166:20.70]Primary mission objective, find hidden entrance into lower-level AI lab.
[166:27.37]Security doors that are located in this area require the correct code keys to allow access.
[166:34.01]The location of the keys are unknown... That sounds like he's doing like a Rick impression.
[166:37.53]...that may have already fallen into enemy hands.
[166:40.43]I'm just waiting for like a... Intelligence reports that the Cyclones may have a heavy weapon in the area.
[166:50.31]Okay.
[166:51.61]There might be a heavy weapon in the Cyclone area.
[166:59.17]It's not even sync?
[167:04.39]Uh, initiating combat program, one alpha.
[167:10.35]Okay, should I just... I think I have to do the... I have to do the tutorial.
[167:15.63]Your game will not be saved.
[167:16.95]Please save before running the tutorial or your game will be lost.
[167:21.29]You don't give a fuck.
[167:25.87]Welcome to Cyclones.
[167:26.75]This is where we show you some of the basics of the game.
[167:31.99]Right click on doors to open them.
[167:33.75]Okay.
[167:41.13]Some doors require keys, right?
[167:42.87]Exactly.
[167:45.47]This is the video they play in the line for the roller coaster.
[167:47.58]That's actually true.
[167:49.78]Actually true.
[167:55.10]We talked about that before, right?
[167:57.08]How that's like those videos.
[167:58.44]Wait, I need to pay attention.
[168:00.34]Position cursor over item and right click to use items, okay?
[168:04.68]Right click and view to close inventory.
[168:06.40]Alright, so it's right click.
[168:07.40]I gotta pay attention.
[168:07.98]Hold on.
[168:09.44]I already drank all of my drink already.
[168:11.06]I just got this.
[168:11.90]Okay, so you have to move.
[168:20.71]It's like old light gun controls, but it's a first person shooter.
[168:41.89]Left click to shoot.
[168:42.87]Don't shoot the barrel!
[168:43.61]I feel like this one's going to be good.
[168:46.73]I got high hopes for this one, seriously.
[168:47.95]It's going to be a boomer shooter, doom kind of game.
[169:05.36]Okay, yeah.
[169:05.80]Right click it.
[169:06.50]Right click it.
[169:06.96]Whatever key you have, right click it.
[169:18.53]Enjoy the game.
[169:19.11]I love that.
[169:19.61]That's so cute.
[169:23.69]How do I... Oh, new game is down here.
[169:32.11]Going on medium.
[169:36.98]I was like, why is it?
[169:37.86]Where is it?
[169:43.56]I got a break coming up in about 15 minutes, so I'll get a new drink then.
[169:46.20]Alright, so here we go.
[169:53.20]These are bad guys, right?
[170:04.03]Am I already dead?
[170:18.10]You have to go to the edges of the screen to turn.
[170:25.05]Wait, saber gloves ready?
[170:27.39]How do I strafe?
[170:45.72]Ciao.
[170:58.35]I don't want the saber gloves.
[170:59.25]These things are weak.
[171:06.17]I need an armory key pass.
[171:13.92]Okay, proceed with caution.
[171:18.46]This is kind of... I'm proceeding with caution here, right?
[171:37.75]I think I'm almost at ammo.
[171:38.37]I have one bullet left.
[171:42.08]Is that accurate?
[171:46.16]I like this one.
[172:00.11]Oh, shit.
[172:00.93]Actually, you do run out of ammo.
[172:02.60]Cool.
[172:09.16]Got ya.
[172:09.34]Do they have ammo on them?
[172:20.94]Damage critical.
[172:23.20]Oh, that's not me doing critical hits.
[172:24.74]That's the game saying that I'm gonna die in a second.
[172:53.95]Yeah, this is the map.
[172:58.15]Wait, wall, door, ceiling.
[173:05.91]It's a really detailed map.
[173:09.90]But it kind of does look like a snake rattle and roll level for the Nintendo.
[173:13.86]I don't really know exactly what I'm looking at.
[173:22.50]Yeah, or like a Kirby Dream Course, Beth.
[173:24.36]Alright, nobody had a key.
[173:35.27]The golden eye sound.
[173:42.94]Armory sector B. Wait.
[173:49.06]Oh, thank goodness.
[173:49.68]Okay, hold on.
[173:51.48]50 shots in this now.
[173:55.23]Maybe it's outside.
[174:06.34]Oh, that is a Doomguy outside.
[174:08.22]This guy's huge.
[174:14.58]What do I do?
[174:17.22]Oh, he was easy.
[174:17.80]Never mind.
[174:19.76]Did he drop something?
[174:21.56]I got a bio kit.
[174:30.94]Oh, it's a health pack.
[174:31.76]Okay, so now... That's the... Alright, cool.
[174:35.85]What is that?
[174:37.19]Yep.
[174:37.89]Save.
[174:40.53]Empty slot.
[174:41.17]Yes.
[174:43.15]Cool.
[174:46.19]And a game description.
[174:56.22]Oh, I fucking crashed.
[175:02.41]No, I could stay that way.
[175:03.11]Yeah, it's definitely out here.
[175:11.58]Anyone else?
[175:24.49]Also, I do love the music, but it's time for it to come down.
[175:32.34]That's better.
[175:39.15]No?
[175:42.83]I feel like it's better this way.
[175:44.21]I can actually play the game and concentrate on what I'm doing.
[175:49.04]That's scary in there.
[176:03.62]This is a good one.
[176:04.26]I like this one.
[176:08.70]Those are not eyes staring at me.
[176:16.91]A lot of shit in here.
[176:26.92]Mech kit.
[176:32.88]Another mech kit.
[176:34.06]Health pack.
[176:36.16]Bio kit.
[176:44.72]I'm looking for the key card.
[176:50.35]It is very dark.
[176:53.43]What does a mech kit do?
[176:54.55]I'm afraid to use it.
[177:04.85]Armor repair.
[177:06.07]Oh, okay.
[177:06.41]Cool.
[177:06.59]I think it's not in there.
[177:09.88]Is it somewhere I haven't been?
[177:18.02]Been in here.
[177:21.38]What about... Wait, maybe down here.
[177:28.25]There's a little section over here too.
[177:30.51]The shelves had some more stuff.
[177:31.55]Did it?
[177:31.81]It's just kind of dark.
[177:35.84]Let me move my legs.
[177:37.02]There we go.
[177:47.53]You're right.
[177:48.81]Another bio kit.
[177:52.05]Got a lot of these now.
[177:52.93]Come on, red keys.
[177:55.53]Armory key's gotta be in here.
[177:56.73]Has to be.
[178:00.59]Gotta be, right?
[178:09.17]Maybe not.
[178:11.71]I'm full now.
[178:12.29]I can save the game.
[178:13.69]Can you please play Nightmare Kart?
[178:35.28]I have wacky races.
[178:41.75]That's something I want to play.
[178:44.29]Wacky, wacky races, wacky racers.
[178:47.58]That's close enough.
[179:00.49]I need a key.
[179:03.81]Shit.
[179:09.63]Did I miss something down here?
[179:18.99]What about Robocop?
[179:22.93]I thought about Robocop again.
[179:32.54]Maybe it dropped off one of these guys.
[179:47.84]Oh, that's a door I didn't open.
[179:55.44]What'd you drop?
[179:55.86]I think there was a second one here.
[180:07.61]Where is he?
[180:13.07]This is bad.
[180:28.69]How do you not hide something right here?
[180:29.85]Hey, remember when in RoboCop?
[180:33.41]Yep.
[180:48.18]There's nothing in there?
[180:49.46]How is nothing in that little spot?
[180:52.96]Impossible.
[181:00.28]Can I destroy the boxes?
[181:01.28]Let me see.
[181:01.76]I can jump, but I can't jump up here.
[181:08.76]Unless there's a spot I can go here.
[181:19.72]Nope.
[181:28.31]There's a lot more to see, though.
[181:35.14]turret what the fuck is hitting me oh my god oh my god oh boy shit I had to use all of my heat no that can't be I this they're probably such a finite resource
[182:13.63]Is that not going to die?
[182:14.41]I'm wasting so much ammo.
[182:37.70]Oh, blocking mechanism must be online.
[182:56.91]No key card.
[182:59.97]Has to be in this room then.
[183:03.84]I can jump up these aren't.
[183:07.40]Time for some platforming.
[183:14.20]That looks like a card to me.
[183:18.15]Maintenance key.
[183:20.85]Nice.
[183:21.07]Alright.
[183:21.63]That was back upstairs.
[183:26.05]Save it here.
[183:30.18]I got a break coming up here in a minute.
[183:31.92]I'm going to stay on this one because I think it's fun.
[183:45.52]I do want to get a refill of a drink too.
[183:50.19]But let me get up there.
[183:56.79]Are they killing each other in the hallway?
[183:58.09]But I do not.
[184:01.59]I think this is where I need to go.
[184:16.06]Good, OK.
[184:18.96]I only have 16 bullets, but I gotta be careful.
[184:22.08]I'll be back.
[184:24.89]I'm not going to save it there because I feel like it took too many shots.
[184:32.22]Yeah, be back in a few minutes and I'm going to get a new drink and we'll come back to cyclones in a minute.
[190:43.27]Okay.
[190:44.83]I'm back.
[190:58.89]I am here.
[191:04.12]Oh shit.
[191:04.50]I forgot my drink.
[191:05.44]One sec.
[192:20.62]Okay, I am back now.
[192:21.56]Let's continue our playing session of Cyclones.
[192:26.86]Alright, what was I doing?
[192:33.64]Where was I going?
[192:34.32]Alright, down here.
[192:46.48]I got a Coca-Cola.
[192:49.54]One of the little baby cans.
[192:55.21]It looks dangerous.
[192:55.93]Why?
[192:56.09]How much longer do you think you're going to stream?
[193:08.51]Oh, a couple hours.
[193:09.77]Two or three hours, something like that.
[193:11.87]I want to get through at least one or two more games.
[193:16.24]or I don't know like I said sometimes hold on a second here this guy's gonna kill me shit I'm out of ammo uh sometimes I get in the game and want to play for four hours sometimes I get in the game and want to quit in 10 seconds
[193:44.11]Alright, now I go all the way back.
[193:53.83]Do you think I'll make it back?
[193:55.77]Do you think I'll remember how to get back?
[193:58.35]Uh, good question.
[193:59.49]Wait, there's more.
[194:01.89]Wasn't there more?
[194:02.41]I think that's it.
[194:06.74]That's it.
[194:12.58]Oh, fuck.
[194:15.55]Why is it like this?
[194:16.15]I don't know.
[194:20.56]I'm just going to go.
[194:26.42]This looks like a screensaver.
[194:27.70]I mean, kind of.
[194:30.82]I think it's all the way back up, right?
[194:36.27]Which door is it?
[194:36.77]This one or this one?
[194:42.79]This one?
[194:44.02]Yep.
[194:45.64]I'm sorry.
[194:46.22]I'm so jumpy.
[194:47.08]And that's my... I'm sorry about that.
[194:49.44]It's literally a standard enemy in the game.
[194:52.97]And I'm acting like it's fucking Jason running behind me.
[194:55.73]I'm gonna die.
[194:56.29]I am dead.
[195:02.94]These things fucking destroy you.
[195:05.36]Okay, I need ammo before I go in here.
[195:14.23]Maintenance key?
[195:17.09]Oh man, this is far away.
[195:18.57]Is it?
[195:36.44]Open!
[195:36.76]Oh wait, I can't open that.
[195:43.59]Where was this?
[195:44.39]It was back up the stairs, maybe?
[195:45.73]And there was a door.
[195:48.75]There was the two or three blue guys.
[195:52.77]Where was it?
[195:53.97]Fuck!
[195:54.75]I didn't think I was gonna die right there.
[195:59.83]No, this is way too far back.
[196:01.05]This is where I just was.
[196:04.11]Where was it?
[196:09.56]Check the map.
[196:12.08]Yeah, good luck reading this!
[196:22.19]I don't even know where my character is.
[196:29.42]It's down here and then it's a little door to the is it this one?
[196:33.64]No, it's there.
[196:34.28]It's down here.
[196:35.72]OK, everybody stop freaking out.
[196:37.64]It's just a game relax.
[196:40.10]I'm saving my ammo.
[196:53.36]Okay.
[196:55.52]I want all the ammo.
[196:56.42]I want all the good shit here.
[196:58.76]Then I'm going to use the gun upstairs on the drones.
[197:10.11]There was a secret room right here.
[197:11.31]Uh-huh.
[197:14.67]Alright, save it.
[197:44.25]Okay.
[197:45.43]Did we drop anything?
[197:47.81]No one's dropping ammo.
[197:53.11]Wrong button.
[197:56.53]Alright.
[197:57.49]I am ready.
[197:57.91]I got a save point.
[198:03.04]Go back.
[198:06.92]Let's go.
[198:07.58]Alright.
[198:10.82]I gotta clear at least level one.
[198:12.00]Can I really call myself an older gamer if I can't beat the first level of Cyclones?
[198:25.49]Every bullet counts here.
[198:31.83]These guys can kill you in literally one second.
[198:34.30]It's incredibly nerve-wracking gameplay right now.
[198:37.56]I'm incredibly nervous.
[198:48.20]A lot of good shit.
[198:50.52]Nice.
[198:52.62]Photon chain gun.
[199:04.14]Ah, do I not have the photon chain gun?
[199:09.09]I just have ammo for it.
[199:10.13]Alright, that's fine.
[199:17.83]Find it later.
[199:27.62]Oops.
[199:29.74]How did I get turned around, Andy?
[199:38.95]I got full ammo in this thing.
[199:46.81]Patron scans show most weaponry missing.
[199:50.97]But is it telling me I forgot a bunch of shit?
[199:54.17]I think that's a game saying, hey, you've... No, no, no, no.
[199:56.92]It's right there.
[200:04.14]Photon chain gun.
[200:07.88]Nice.
[200:08.12]Alright.
[200:16.25]Oh yeah?
[200:16.97]Hold it up camera tripod?
[200:20.98]Ready to stuff it into somebody's face?
[200:24.70]Now I have access to the elevator.
[200:35.33]Now is the elevator the thing that was where the turret was?
[200:37.57]I actually don't remember.
[200:55.94]Turn that music up.
[201:06.17]Nah.
[201:10.01]Nah.
[201:13.44]Alright, elevator's on.
[201:14.28]I don't even know what that is.
[201:16.26]Does anybody have any idea what this thing is?
[201:23.97]Did I have it right?
[201:24.67]Was it actually in that spot?
[201:27.13]Is this the elevator?
[201:34.80]This thing is pretty sick though.
[201:35.84]Alright, I'm going to take this down to 300 ammo and I'm not going to use it anymore.
[201:44.68]In fact, no.
[201:46.16]I'm only going to use it when I need it.
[201:50.68]I got 63 in this one.
[201:52.86]Let's go.
[202:06.02]I got a lot of stuff.
[202:11.12]I don't know.
[202:17.42]Why am I being prepared for this?
[202:29.88]Boss incoming?
[202:38.33]Alright, well that's... I think this is it right here.
[202:41.74]Alright, let's go.
[202:45.86]Wait, is this the entrance?
[202:51.56]Alright, man, let's go.
[202:52.50]It's time for the boss fight.
[202:53.80]That's the entrance.
[202:54.66]I walked in there 25 minutes ago.
[202:58.93]I think it's the thing down here.
[203:07.06]What was that?
[203:07.46]It was where the turret was, I think.
[203:10.98]Good luck remembering that.
[203:18.73]Where was that shit?
[203:23.11]Why am I... Why even look at the map?
[203:24.53]I don't even know where to start with that.
[203:26.92]I probably could sit there and look at it, but you can't zoom out.
[203:39.61]I think it's this way.
[203:42.47]Yep.
[203:42.63]Alright.
[203:43.69]And go.
[203:47.99]Did I miss every shot?
[203:52.50]No.
[204:02.05]Yeah.
[204:04.45]I just beat the game.
[204:05.93]Major Ducharme, commence phase two briefing.
[204:09.57]It's very important that you mark the location of all alien craft, weapons, and cyclones that are destroyed or disabled.
[204:15.73]This allows AI's recovery team to go in and study any new opposition encounter.
[204:21.63]I do appreciate the PlayStation 2 USB headset.
[204:25.05]Havoc unit will switch to combat tactic Echo Delta search and rescue.
[204:30.05]Neutralization of enemy units will continue as conditions dictate.
[204:34.02]Intel reports the security elevator located on this level has been sabotaged.
[204:38.47]Havoc unit must seek an alternative route to the lab's other sectors.
[204:42.58]Also located somewhere on this level is Objective-1 Bravo, the hostage.
[204:46.80]Objective-1 Bravo must be rescued alive.
[204:49.56]I repeat, alive.
[204:50.96]Reason?
[204:51.74]The hostage is the only known living holder of the BioLink key, which is used to access Hangar 18, which holds an alien ship.
[204:58.24]I want to make a game like this so bad.
[204:59.45]A BioLink key will only work with the full cooperation of the key holder.
[205:03.13]So any stress being felt by the holder of such a key is felt by the key and will prevent the key from functioning.
[205:08.67]This small security measure is why the Cyclones have not recaptured the ship.
[205:12.86]If he's under any stress at all, the key won't work.
[205:14.71]Cola machine.
[205:15.15]I love when they add stuff like this.
[205:16.33]Does it work?
[205:17.09]I tried to burp so silently.
[205:40.16]I tried to burp silently, but it- that was a- it backfired massively.
[205:45.24]Uh, that was a very- that was like a acidic, like- that was an acidic burp, and I had to- I had to let it out.
[205:52.60]I'm drinking a Coke, and it was- you know when you get that like acidic burp?
[205:55.30]I just didn't want to burp in the microphone, and that was a disaster.
[205:57.84]This guy just breathes in vapors.
[206:06.01]I burped in my mouth, and then inhaled the vapors, and it made me sick.
[206:10.94]Alright, where is this guy?
[206:44.26]You guys have insane weaponry!
[206:54.68]Damn, alright.
[206:57.89]Game's not a joke anymore.
[206:58.87]Not that it was in the beginning, but... What is that?
[207:09.45]Looks like a dog.
[207:18.16]The Doom monster, if I've ever seen one.
[207:32.49]I keep doing this, and this is... Bottom left corner is inventory.
[207:37.49]This is not inventory.
[207:38.71]It also says I, but... Red inventory.
[207:43.91]Thank you.
[207:44.25]Alright.
[207:46.73]Relax.
[207:47.97]Relax.
[207:48.57]You're fine.
[207:49.15]Relax.
[208:01.04]Secret.
[208:09.26]What is this for?
[208:15.47]This is cool for 1994.
[208:19.19]I think this is... Honestly, this is pretty clean.
[208:21.53]This is really clean.
[208:23.85]Well put together.
[208:24.49]The guns are fun.
[208:26.69]I actually don't mind the system of the... It kind of changes it from an FPS to a... Like a... I don't know.
[208:35.23]I like it.
[208:35.91]It's not aggravating.
[208:37.39]I feel like it could have been, but it's not.
[208:41.41]This one gets an A. This is a clap for sure.
[208:43.23]This one gets an A.
[208:48.00]Alien pistol ammo.
[208:49.12]Okay, I gotta find the alien pistol.
[208:58.31]Is this a boom or a doom?
[209:04.01]Uh, this is definitely a boom.
[209:04.87]Alright, what have I seen so far?
[209:16.00]Uh, okay, cool.
[209:19.76]Take the ceilings off.
[209:20.98]That was what the problem was.
[209:22.20]I had the ceilings on.
[209:23.28]I had The Sims feature where you had the roof on.
[209:26.68]Now I can actually see the rooms.
[209:40.95]Okay.
[209:41.97]This isn't really... I think this is not really helpful.
[210:00.48]I feel like there's something I can do in here.
[210:01.76]There's got to be something I can do in here.
[210:03.72]What is the point of this?
[210:04.38]Holy shit.
[210:14.76]Do you see what's going on right now?
[210:19.46]Ah, that's so cool.
[210:25.98]So, I want to go...
[210:33.58]So where am I?
[210:34.32]Am I right there?
[210:35.06]I can see this, this two dogs.
[210:42.10]Where am I?
[210:42.66]Is that me right here?
[210:46.01]This right here?
[210:49.19]I want to go like left out the door and then left again.
[210:52.51]Okay.
[210:54.51]This is where I'm in this room right now.
[210:58.48]So we need to go outside of here, go right into the door, and then go right.
[211:13.23]And I'm really glad I learned how to read that map, because how would I have ever done that if I didn't start reading the map?
[211:22.86]Hollow wall detected.
[211:32.67]Can I shoot through it?
[211:46.34]Wait a minute, where does that put me now?
[211:49.55]You're the yellow on the map?
[211:53.79]Wait, what?
[212:01.85]Confused.
[212:02.33]I can't do anything with this.
[212:07.61]Well, now I know that there's walls I can go through.
[212:09.69]There's an area that I just haven't gone at all.
[212:34.01]Down here.
[212:39.51]Even though I grew up after these kind of games came out, it still looks cool.
[212:43.16]And I'm sure it was super innovative at the time.
[212:45.76]Oh, for sure.
[212:46.30]Yeah.
[212:48.96]During the 3DO streams, we've talked extensively about how a lot of these game developers were paving the road as they were walking on it.
[213:01.20]The amount of shit that they had to do in the background to make that light look like that.
[213:07.86]They were doing magic.
[213:18.95]Alright, I feel like I'm missing something though.
[213:23.49]They had no point of reference at all.
[213:24.88]Yeah.
[213:29.36]It's a really interesting concept.
[213:32.31]genuinely kind of, and I don't mean this as a negative term, but kind of having no idea what's going on and no idea what you're doing.
[213:41.71]It's just like, wait, we have this new technology that lets us do kind of stuff like this in a computer?
[213:53.34]Like, let's just, they made it up as they were going along.
[213:55.58]Alright, there's another empty room.
[213:59.70]What is going on here?
[214:03.57]And we laugh, we, you know, we poke fun at some of these titles, right?
[214:07.17]Like, oh, like Siberia.
[214:10.37]That shit was fucking hard, man.
[214:11.95]That stuff was not easy.
[214:23.92]ID Engine is the first real solid 3D engine.
[214:28.22]Man, how many... how many hairs on the top of all those devs' heads were just disintegrated coming up with this from the fucking scratch bottom level?
[214:40.21]Uh, I don't know where to go.
[214:40.95]It's very clearly this way, but like I... You know the secret door?
[214:47.85]Here?
[214:48.51]I think it's right there.
[214:54.44]Turn around and go straight.
[215:02.10]I'll find it eventually.
[215:05.44]Not like on one of these walls, right?
[215:12.75]John Carmack somehow kept a full head of hair.
[215:24.04]I kind of don't know where to go.
[215:25.00]Alright, let me like actually pay attention to where I'm walking.
[215:29.20]Rather than doing the Minecraft build the wall and put... Okay, I made it.
[215:33.46]Right?
[215:33.84]Yeah, I made it.
[215:34.72]I haven't been here.
[215:35.78]Right?
[215:37.10]I have.
[215:38.10]Right?
[215:38.60]No.
[215:39.00]Fuck.
[215:46.59]I can't go that way.
[215:47.43]Alright, if I go straight through here
[215:56.25]This looks like a weird, I can't, this probably, is there a wall I can go through there?
[215:59.05]It looks weird.
[216:01.80]Okay, this way.
[216:03.10]Then left at the intersection, like through the door.
[216:08.74]Left at the intersection.
[216:13.17]So, around, I'll just do it again.
[216:14.91]Let's just go like this.
[216:17.23]Left at the intersection.
[216:18.19]Okay, then...
[216:25.28]Straight through this door.
[216:28.36]And then like down here.
[216:29.44]So straight through the door and then wrap around left.
[216:37.40]Oh, fuck.
[216:37.90]Where am I?
[216:38.30]Wait, where am I?
[216:38.86]What direction am I facing?
[216:47.87]Wait, where the hell am I going?
[216:49.15]Where am I?
[216:49.69]I feel like it keeps changing where I am on the map.
[217:12.94]How did I get the- It has to be a door that's hidden, right?
[217:19.11]Bang a left.
[217:21.17]And go left.
[217:25.49]And then... Into this door.
[217:30.57]Here.
[217:33.58]And then the back of wall?
[217:34.78]Shit!
[217:40.38]Shit!
[217:42.76]I thought there was going to be a fake wall right here.
[217:48.18]Walking back and forth through three, four different rooms.
[217:51.31]Yeah, but see, look, like how, like what the hell's going on here?
[218:02.31]How do I get like in here?
[218:03.62]This is where the office chairs were.
[218:07.54]That was a secret door, but I can't go...
[218:18.94]I don't know.
[218:19.24]I have to take the elevator?
[218:21.24]The elevator didn't work.
[218:23.78]Did I not power the elevator?
[218:30.24]Yeah, we'll move on.
[218:32.30]I only wanted to beat the first level anyways.
[218:34.18]I think it's great though.
[218:36.00]I just, for some reason, cannot figure out how to get anywhere else.
[218:43.44]Wait, maybe like one of these control room things?
[218:55.67]What room is this?
[218:56.25]I don't know.
[219:02.30]I almost got lost in my two hallway middle school.
[219:04.58]It happens.
[219:13.21]I think it's like here.
[219:15.95]There already was a secret door that led to nowhere.
[219:18.25]Alright, I'm going to give it 10 more seconds.
[219:29.89]Damn it.
[219:40.12]It's in here.
[219:42.52]Out of, wait, object out of range?
[219:44.32]What do you mean out of range?
[219:49.17]What?
[219:51.89]Is there a button on the desk?
[220:03.21]Why did it say object out of range?
[220:04.57]I don't get it.
[220:21.17]I'm too stupid.
[220:22.15]Alright, that was Cyclones.
[220:26.45]It was an A+.
[220:31.81]Maybe the draw?
[220:34.01]It's alright.
[220:35.24]I want to do some more anyways.
[220:40.36]You got stuck in the same place eight years ago.
[220:42.24]I didn't play this eight years ago.
[220:46.10]That was a very good one though.
[220:47.56]Excellent job to all the Cyclone developers.
[220:50.03]The FMV was wonderful.
[220:52.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[221:05.66]Alright, what's the next one?
[221:08.30]Um, this one's gonna be long.
[221:12.08]This is gonna be a long one, so I hope you're ready.
[221:15.72]This might be the last one we do tonight, depending on if it's very good.
[221:19.11]It probably is very good.
[221:24.01]This one's called Curse the Eye of Isis.
[221:28.89]It is a Resident Evil-like...
[221:32.38]It's a survival horror game, and I'm ready to get locked in.
[221:36.26]Turn your lights off in your fucking house.
[221:44.86]Here we go.
[221:54.29]It's kind of loud, but whatever.
[221:55.43]I'll turn it on.
[222:07.35]You'll be able to see it in just a second.
[222:14.06]This is a controller game.
[222:18.02]I did already come in here and turn the volume down, but I might need to go a little bit more.
[222:21.34]How's that?
[222:29.26]Like that?
[222:32.01]Like that.
[222:37.36]We good?
[222:43.78]How's that?
[222:50.14]Perfect.
[222:54.53]Alright, new game.
[222:59.15]London in 1890.
[223:08.65]The Museum of Great Britain.
[223:10.49]New exhibition of ancient Egypt.
[223:18.38]Yeah, the game's called Curse, colon, The Eye of Isis.
[223:22.15]It might not even be in the fucking directory on Twitch.
[223:39.27]I don't know if I'm a thief or... Am I the thief?
[223:56.02]Dude, that was awful!
[223:57.62]I'm so glad I turned it down!
[223:58.98]Oh no, the curse!
[224:06.42]The curse of Isis!
[224:13.60]Climbing back up the rope is crazy.
[224:18.02]That takes some real strength.
[224:26.61]No, no, don't get the janitor.
[224:27.99]Come on.
[224:29.33]Don't get the janitor.
[224:30.09]What did he do?
[224:42.90]Sorry, sir.
[224:43.66]I'm afraid the museum's closed to the public.
[224:47.02]That's alright.
[224:48.08]I'm due to meet a colleague of mine.
[224:49.72]She promised me a preview tonight.
[224:52.46]I'm afraid there'll be no previews this evening, sir, and possibly no opening tomorrow.
[224:56.59]All museum staff are currently helping us with our inquiries.
[224:59.35]Right next to his ear.
[225:01.09]Thank you.
[225:01.75]Now, sir, please go home.
[225:03.57]My officers will deal with the situation.
[225:12.65]Alright, well, we're going in.
[225:13.43]The door's not even locked!
[225:21.04]They did not even try to prevent somebody from going in.
[225:27.20]Sir, get away from the premises, please.
[225:28.70]And don't even try the door.
[225:30.96]Don't try the wooden, plywood, hollow door.
[225:38.01]Okay, we can do this.
[225:45.45]Yeah, that was kind of scary.
[225:46.73]Okay, that's your menu.
[225:51.19]That's map.
[225:56.53]Seems like, okay, I get it.
[226:00.36]Why does everything scare you?
[226:01.92]Because loud, abrupt sound effects scare anybody.
[226:05.26]What was the last time you heard a loud, abrupt sound effect and you didn't go, woo!
[226:17.43]Okay.
[226:18.31]A security booth is beyond this door, but it has been hastily padlocked from the outside.
[226:21.99]That is very curious.
[226:24.68]That is very curious.
[226:31.46]The new Egyptian collection is due open tomorrow, the sign says.
[226:34.12]Okay.
[226:39.22]A heavy oak desk, deep scores, and scratches surround the brass keyhole on one of the top drawers.
[226:44.47]Someone has tried to force it open.
[226:48.54]Need a key.
[226:50.00]Brass keyhole.
[226:56.93]You found an oil lamp.
[226:58.05]Do you wish to take it?
[226:59.45]Yes or no?
[227:00.53]Yes.
[227:01.21]I think that, okay, that's a yes.
[227:03.31]You took the lamp.
[227:07.39]This is gonna be scary.
[227:09.95]Get ready.
[227:14.16]The laboratory.
[227:21.77]I gotta turn it up.
[227:30.25]I gotta turn it up.
[227:34.43]Or do I?
[227:35.45]Some of the sounds feel like they're too low.
[227:39.62]Some of them feel like they're not... Whatever.
[227:48.66]What's that?
[227:55.89]Gentlemen?
[228:04.96]Where's the water?
[228:07.36]There's no water in this museum?
[228:09.84]What did you stick your head in there?
[228:10.78]I don't get it.
[228:13.49]How are you playing this game, by the way?
[228:15.21]How physically am I playing it?
[228:17.63]It is on GOG.
[228:19.37]You can get this on Good Old Games.
[228:20.37]There's gonna be a key in the toilet.
[228:24.03]Watch this.
[228:29.24]Oh, I can hold this up.
[228:41.38]There's no key in the toilet.
[228:42.92]What kind of game is this?
[228:43.70]Oh, what's that?
[228:47.69]You found some menthol.
[228:49.07]Do you wish to take it?
[228:51.63]You've taken the menthol.
[228:54.59]Menthol?
[228:56.11]Like mint?
[229:00.37]Oh, this is disgusting.
[229:06.38]Wait, what did that say?
[229:07.92]The stench exuding from the ancient plumbing system makes you feel quite ill.
[229:12.74]They were using this in ancient Egypt.
[229:14.70]That's disgusting.
[229:15.78]Wow.
[229:15.88]I'll tell you, you know what I want?
[229:19.35]I want a, uh, I want the urinal to, I want to change the urinal forever.
[229:24.79]I don't, I want a P into a hole.
[229:27.61]I want there to be a big open hole, and I want the hole to be, so see where my feet are right now?
[229:33.24]I want the hole to start in front of me there, and I want the hole to go, let's call it like seven, six or seven feet deep.
[229:42.45]I want it to be a per- I don't want any splash.
[229:46.10]I want to just pee into a hole and then have it get collected down to the bottom of the drain and shit.
[229:51.44]And then get, um, cleaned up or something somehow.
[229:54.45]I- one of the things I hate the most about a urinal is the piss splash back.
[230:00.37]It just- you're peeing into a porcelain wall.
[230:04.55]And I don't want to have piss splash back on me.
[230:07.85]Somebody else's piss that pissed on top of someone else's piss two hours ago, and then somebody pissed on that.
[230:13.38]And don't even get me started on like, well, what about the splashing pads?
[230:16.68]Those don't do anything.
[230:17.82]Those just make them foam and get gross.
[230:27.25]Wait, there's another door.
[230:29.55]You pee on the side.
[230:31.11]I've done this.
[230:32.41]We've had this talk before.
[230:35.95]Ladies, public toilets.
[230:36.79]The door is locked from the other side, okay?
[230:41.28]We have been using what may as well be ancient technology to pee.
[230:46.64]We have had the iPhone come out.
[230:48.56]We have had dozens of video game consoles come out.
[230:52.22]We've had computers can generate themselves.
[230:56.95]We have LED, LCD.
[231:00.65]Lighting technology.
[231:01.85]We have lamps.
[231:03.98]You mean to tell me that the only invention, the only, only invention in the bathroom world are these just urinals that sit on the wall?
[231:16.45]I don't, I don't understand.
[231:17.41]Why have we not developed a better public bathroom?
[231:27.57]Yeah, look, okay, go from the outhouse to, okay, forget modern plumbing.
[231:32.41]Modern plumbing is a big deal.
[231:34.35]That's a huge deal.
[231:36.23]I'm talking about since the invention of modern plumbing, we just stopped.
[231:43.14]Yeah, that porcelain wall that you piss into, it's fine.
[231:45.52]That's exactly the way it should be.
[231:46.74]No, this should be something that, like, accepts the piss that goes into, like, a receptacle that doesn't even touch you.
[231:57.25]Uh-oh.
[232:04.34]That did scare me.
[232:13.39]I am Abdul Waheed, sir.
[232:15.09]I am honored to have worked with your father on his many expeditions in my country.
[232:19.72]You know my father?
[232:21.68]I've never heard him talk of you.
[232:23.46]Can we get the camera to be up a little higher?
[232:26.56]Please, Darian.
[232:27.64]He knew me well enough to entrust me with these papers.
[232:29.97]See, they are written in his own hand.
[232:32.27]You must take them and read them quickly, for his words will help you much faster than mine.
[232:37.82]Library.
[232:38.18]Library.
[232:59.52]Locked the atrium.
[233:00.36]That's the only way through.
[233:01.40]Is this a save point?
[233:02.58]Or is he going to go... And then an alien is going to burst out of his chest.
[233:05.88]Okay.
[233:06.08]Smelling salts.
[233:06.50]Do I just do drugs in this game?
[233:08.20]I don't get it.
[233:30.08]He found a letter.
[233:30.76]Alright, here we go.
[233:31.44]Is that all he wrote?
[234:00.49]That can't be it.
[234:01.55]Yeah, that cannot be it, right?
[234:03.33]Okay, there we go.
[234:03.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[234:08.02]What adventures we could have had.
[234:09.92]The things you will see in your lifetime I can scarcely envisage.
[234:14.08]Envisage?
[234:15.30]Envision?
[234:16.68]But it is a journey you shall make without knowing the people who brought you into this world, which causes me more pain than anything else which has occurred in my later years.
[234:25.59]I would never speak ill of my dear sister, Elizabeth, having cared for you since my incarceration in this hideous place.
[234:32.66]She has promised me that you have been informed of the full details of how I came to be here.
[234:37.78]young as you are you must understand that the pursuit of knowledge can carry the gravest price I only wish she had relented in her refusal to let you visit me I console myself with the thought that you shall not spend your life under the veil of a lie of what became of me the hospital has refused to let me continue my research they do not understand the urgency with which our work must be completed
[235:02.57]They call themselves doctors, barbarians.
[235:05.79]I cannot tell you what acts in the name of science they inflict upon us here.
[235:10.84]And they consider me mad.
[235:13.06]They destroyed all of my research, save for my journal, which I know is in safe hands with my companion Abdul, who I trust with my life and was with us when the evil witch destroyed our family.
[235:25.31]and was released.
[235:26.85]He alone can guide you, Darion.
[235:28.77]He has forgiven me for the way I acted, knowing it was not my will that made me do what I did.
[235:34.98]And he will have faith in my son too, had I known what I know now.
[235:39.61]Dearest Darion, you must continue our work.
[235:42.25]Your mother, my beloved wife, knew what we were doing was right.
[235:46.09]I know you will find strength where I failed, and that you shall undo the errors we made.
[235:50.71]Darion, my son, it curses upon our family.
[235:54.82]You alone can end the madness and end it you must before it consumes you too.
[235:59.44]But do not underestimate his power.
[236:01.68]Be true to who you are, your loving father, Stanley Dayne.
[236:20.52]Okay, there we go.
[236:28.00]Ed McMillan released a trailer for his game today?
[236:30.78]Eugenics, the one he tried to get in contact with you, but you didn't do anything.
[236:38.14]Wait, what?
[236:40.32]Oh, you mean on Twitter?
[236:41.24]Yeah, on Twitter.
[236:43.12]Yeah, I buy Twitter DMs.
[236:45.52]I really kind of don't look at them.
[236:54.25]Who just died?
[237:02.40]Poor devil.
[237:08.87]Constable is dead.
[237:09.91]There is no sign of violence.
[237:11.09]Only his face frozen in terror.
[237:24.40]Wait, did I say that?
[237:25.85]Okay.
[237:42.30]Yeah, I like deleted my whole presence from social media.
[237:45.22]Look at my Twitter.
[237:45.78]I haven't tweeted in like two and a half years.
[237:56.49]How do you fight?
[238:02.07]Can I fight this guy?
[238:02.85]What do I do?
[238:09.92]Oh my god!
[238:10.34]He runs!
[238:13.52]What is he doing?
[238:15.14]What is he doing to me?
[238:16.60]What is he... He's just strangling me in the corner!
[238:23.09]What do I do?
[238:27.02]I can't move.
[238:27.74]He's just struggling.
[238:43.48]I think I have to get out of the corner.
[238:45.56]I'm stuck here.
[238:59.35]Press C?
[239:00.61]What is that?
[239:02.11]What is that on the controller?
[239:04.49]No, that's lamp.
[239:05.63]That's hold lamp up.
[239:30.10]uh oh great no dude I can speed run it I know where to go I know where to go you know so now that I think about it too I think I told you guys like at some point six months ago
[240:00.52]I left a lot of people on read.
[240:02.46]There were people I had to reach back out to that I was like, hey, sorry, I fucking didn't say anything for like a year.
[240:07.12]I just kind of disappeared.
[240:20.73]Okay.
[240:21.75]Get the lamp.
[240:36.97]Go get the menthol, that'll be good.
[240:59.95]This doesn't open.
[241:02.75]Small price to pay to never use social media.
[241:09.40]Yeah, I mean, I... Social media is fine.
[241:11.76]Like, I don't... I don't hate it or anything.
[241:13.49]I just don't really use it, and... I think I may... I talked about this a long time ago, but... The... The nature of social media is kind of... If you have... If you have, like, an account, it's almost like, okay, well, you... Now you have to talk.
[241:32.56]You gotta say stuff.
[241:33.64]You have to.
[241:34.28]I mean, it's Jerma985 here.
[241:37.56]Why have you not said anything?
[241:47.36]I think there's a lot of pressure on social media to participate in everything.
[241:51.84]And I kind of was just like, I don't really want to do that anymore.
[242:05.08]The best post was a Thanksgiving dump.
[242:08.72]And that's all that has to be there too.
[242:22.18]Okay.
[242:24.44]Wait, this is where you actually save the game.
[242:30.01]Why did I not do this?
[242:33.55]I even said he was the save point, too.
[242:37.67]Are you saying that you're depressed?
[242:41.72]No, no.
[242:42.16]No.
[242:47.03]I'm just saying it's... The pressures of social media are real.
[242:52.89]They are.
[242:53.98]Not just for me.
[242:55.10]Not just for like, oh, I'm a Twitch streamer and I have a million followers.
[242:59.22]I think it's on a lot of people.
[243:02.40]It's on everybody.
[243:07.37]Okay, I saved it.
[243:15.61]That guy dies.
[243:24.88]do what you want who cares yeah that you know what that's and that's you know what exactly what my mindset is now you understand when I came back to streaming for a lot how about what I what I tell you right I'm just doing whatever I'm gonna do we just just do you whatever that is that's what I'm that's it it is what it is
[243:56.40]Alright, we saw this.
[243:57.26]He turns into a monster.
[244:03.81]Poor devil.
[244:06.99]Staring at the pigeons in the park.
[244:13.18]I'm coming up on a break, but before I... I'm going to stay with this one because I think this one's going to be fun.
[244:19.66]Wait, this is social media.
[244:21.14]That's right.
[244:23.16]Well, I think this more as a...
[244:26.66]Video product, right?
[244:32.47]Yeah, I told myself this couple years ago.
[244:34.79]I was just like, hey, I'm not going to pay attention to very much.
[244:38.21]I'm just going to.
[244:39.81]And I kind of fucked off.
[244:40.61]I did.
[244:41.41]Obviously it worked at off brand.
[244:43.05]It took some time to do that.
[244:45.23]But.
[244:46.69]Yeah, I kind of fucked off and I'm back here now.
[244:50.79]What's up?
[244:54.48]Now, hey, well, I'll leave you.
[244:55.48]I'll leave you with that.
[244:58.26]Forever.
[247:04.71]What is up?
[247:20.90]Alright, so he's about to get up.
[247:22.50]He's about to attack.
[247:23.18]Alright, so do I just run away?
[247:35.50]I think I just have to run.
[247:45.94]He gets up.
[247:51.83]Alright, I don't have a weapon or anything, so get out.
[248:02.17]He runs really fast.
[248:07.47]Oh my god, please.
[248:08.15]You can't open the door, right?
[248:37.74]OK, let me save the game.
[248:38.72]OK, now let me see if I can go buy him.
[248:57.93]I appreciate the Resident Evil map.
[249:01.95]I can still hear him running.
[249:13.23]Okay.
[249:13.71]Alright, I got by.
[249:22.52]That does not work.
[249:24.04]That does not work.
[249:28.14]Can I at least read what it says?
[249:29.22]No, we're not doing that.
[249:44.94]I just was seeing if I could go up it.
[249:47.54]And now I'm stuck here again.
[249:48.42]Alright, well just strangle me already!
[249:51.71]And let me just redo it!
[249:53.99]I don't... I'm just gonna let him just kill me.
[250:08.59]How do you get stuck in the same exact spot again?
[250:22.48]This gotta be like a punch or a push, right?
[250:27.16]I can't... I can't... No, I can believe I ended up here again because I did the same thing and I tried to open the door.
[250:32.08]It's alright, we're right there.
[250:41.67]I knew he wasn't gonna finish Chrono Trigger.
[250:44.11]Well, I got news for you.
[250:46.71]That is precisely what I'm doing tomorrow.
[250:53.25]Alright, so I can't do anything over there.
[250:59.48]Nothing useful.
[251:02.26]No boards or something.
[251:03.14]I can't like put a board up.
[251:26.07]I knew you weren't gonna have a public domain, Movie Night.
[251:31.48]What do you know?
[251:32.08]Um... Oh.
[251:50.50]You have found some bullets.
[251:51.58]Do you take them?
[251:52.42]Yes.
[251:54.50]What about a gun?
[251:56.74]Some kind of hired thug.
[252:02.60]Something is coming out of the toilet!
[252:03.78]Something's coming out of the toilet!
[252:10.83]You don't have three toilets lined up like this unless you can do something weird, right?
[252:20.32]Discolored water?
[252:30.87]I think this is still locked.
[252:37.89]Now what?
[252:44.22]Should I go back in the bathroom?
[252:50.60]Ah!
[252:51.82]Okay, this got scary actually.
[252:55.19]Oh god.
[252:55.63]Uh...
[253:00.62]Nothing.
[253:04.14]They're so fast.
[253:05.18]This is not like Resident Evil.
[253:06.24]This is way worse.
[253:07.12]This is way harder.
[253:07.98]This is ten times more scary than Resident Evil.
[253:15.68]Oh shit.
[253:16.56]Now they're gonna use that in the fucking Steam page.
[253:19.92]God damn it.
[253:23.50]They're gonna quote that on the Steam page.
[253:35.26]I mean, I said it.
[253:36.48]I... I said it, so... Wait, what, am I gonna pretend I didn't say that?
[253:41.19]That's why it's called a quote.
[253:43.53]I said it.
[253:43.91]I mean, it's not like some of those quotes that you see that are... It's like, dot, dot, dot, dot, wonderfully.
[253:55.61]But, like, the dots before it were, like, an unbelievably, wonderfully horrible experience.
[254:07.80]How do I get- I need a gun.
[254:15.91]They gave me bullets, but they didn't give me a gun.
[254:17.71]Those are dots after, actually.
[254:24.55]Yeah, well, you know what I mean.
[254:32.30]Where's a gun?
[254:36.40]Back in the bathroom?
[254:38.40]The bathroom did start glowing.
[254:50.11]He doesn't have a weapon on him or anything.
[254:54.03]Gonna do the spooky toilet thing.
[255:04.17]Did I miss something?
[255:05.68]Is something in my inventory a gun?
[255:09.18]This is a heal.
[255:12.42]I'm browsing.
[255:12.98]I thought it was a candy bar.
[255:22.86]Check the constable.
[255:25.72]Oh, the one that was... Okay, yeah.
[255:28.28]I feel like I checked it before, but I'll go back.
[255:33.83]What's the spooky toilet thing?
[255:34.93]Dude, go back and watch.
[255:37.65]Should we tell him?
[255:39.15]Go back and watch.
[255:40.57]Five, ten minutes ago.
[255:41.31]It was so messed up.
[255:43.91]I don't even want to remember it.
[255:45.63]It was so awful.
[255:47.89]I don't even want to think about it again.
[255:49.07]It was just genuinely upsetting.
[255:52.79]I don't even want to think about it.
[255:54.17]It was genuinely upsetting.
[255:56.65]I'm sorry.
[255:58.90]I'm sorry, everybody.
[256:08.33]I've been playing this game for 10 hours and I don't know where a gun is!
[256:35.92]You found a truncheon!
[256:38.93]I got a truncheon.
[256:42.92]What's a truncheon?
[256:47.38]That looks like a truncheon to me.
[256:49.80]How do I equip it?
[256:52.92]OK, it's on.
[257:03.55]Oh yeah, now we're playing.
[257:13.97]It's a European baseball bat.
[257:30.11]Oh no, another one.
[257:32.18]Fuck!
[257:38.32]I hate this Resident Evil camera angle shit.
[257:44.24]I keep scaring myself by going to the menu.
[257:55.91]Oh, come on!
[257:59.29]You found a padlock key.
[258:00.65]I know where that goes.
[258:02.21]Oh, yeah!
[258:03.31]This game is fucking good.
[258:04.77]Don't you love it when you just solve a puzzle?
[258:18.30]E3 dialog?
[258:30.95]Go kill the other guy that's down here.
[258:34.17]Oh, that was the other guy that was down here.
[258:39.55]No, they don't do E3 gameplay for single player stuff, do they?
[258:44.72]Why not?
[258:45.30]That's kind of fucked up.
[258:46.68]Why is it not E3 commentary for se- I want there to be somebody hanging out and just being like... Hmm... scared and nervous.
[258:58.75]Got this bat here.
[258:59.49]I wonder if I need to go... Yep.
[259:08.33]Okay.
[259:09.15]Ah, that's so- when they do this immersive camera angle.
[259:14.61]Fire!
[259:15.01]That's just a... Well, I guess like if you... Wait, if you're playing the game by yourself, why would you be doing that if you're not a streamer?
[259:23.94]Or making a YouTube video?
[259:25.28]Yeah, why would you do that?
[259:28.00]That's not realistic to 95% of people that are probably watching E3.
[259:33.00]Or getting any of those trailers.
[259:37.32]Would you just think that the person was just like a crazy person just talking out loud for no reason?
[259:44.17]Talking to somebody else, hanging out in the room.
[259:45.81]Well, I think at that point, you're kind of just annoying.
[259:50.59]If I'm playing a game with somebody... This is the weird thing about streaming and why content creation is so bizarre to me in a lot of ways.
[259:57.55]If I was doing what I'm doing right now, in the room with you right now, if there was less than three or four people in the room, and I'm just sitting there talking about everything that I'm doing and make... People are going to be like, hey, bro, like, I don't... I don't want to hear all this.
[260:14.20]Like, lightbulb!
[260:15.36]Lightbulb!
[260:16.02]Look out!
[260:16.48]Lightbulb!
[260:16.82]I don't- wait, do I- I don't do that anyways.
[260:19.11]Do I say, like, lightbulb?
[260:20.55]Oh, fire!
[260:25.27]I guess sometimes, maybe.
[260:32.11]You do do that.
[260:38.40]Oh, shit.
[260:40.94]Why is it- what's the- why is the thing gonna- How do I- what do I do?
[260:47.40]Get a yellow marker on him.
[260:55.30]Get away from me!
[260:55.84]Get away from me!
[260:57.90]Get away from me!
[261:00.54]Actually, get away from me.
[261:02.88]Ugh.
[261:04.24]Mist.
[261:08.58]Yellow mist.
[261:11.88]Door.
[261:23.55]Lightning!
[261:25.25]What the heck?
[261:29.03]I have the key, you fucking idiot game.
[261:43.50]Wait.
[261:52.71]That was a great look behind.
[262:05.21]This guy's just writing on his notebook.
[262:33.49]Give me the statue, give me the statue, give it to me!
[262:36.45]Take all the stuff, take everything.
[262:38.97]To all Knight staff, concerning the new exhibition to be unveiled this Thursday, we have received word that the Egyptian embassy wishes to have its own representative, Mr. Abdul Wahid, to personally approve our arrangements for the protection of all exhibits, particularly the Eye of Isis.
[262:58.78]All night staff are therefore instructed to assist reviews wherever possible.
[263:04.25]And to show the utmost alertness, this exhibit is one of the most anticipated in the museum's history.
[263:09.23]We do not wish our guests to have the slightest concern as to its safety while under our care.
[263:14.59]However, do take care to ask for identification before offering service.
[263:18.74]In the event of requiring access to prohibited areas, please ensure Victor Kemble, head of night security, is present.
[263:25.60]As always, he will be the only person on duty with a full set of exhibition keys.
[263:28.78]He is not to be disturbed unless absolutely necessary.
[263:34.92]As the last-minute preparations are still underway, be aware that museum staff will be operating within allowed areas up until the night prior to unveiling.
[263:42.89]If you are unsure at any time, please contact Miss Victoria Sutton, who has a full knowledge of all approved exhibition staff at work during the exhibiting sessions,
[263:53.22]Finally, I wish to remind you that the staff rooms are only the... Yeah, whatever, whatever.
[263:57.27]No one else caught, whatever.
[263:58.73]Leaving mugs on, whatever.
[264:01.11]Whatever.
[264:02.25]Well, those caught napping behind... Whatever.
[264:04.36]That is all.
[264:05.80]Nathan Wolfe, museum director, whatever.
[264:23.13]Got the key.
[264:31.13]Got the key.
[264:34.17]Now I'm going to be thinking about that all day.
[264:39.72]Oh no, the E3 guy hates the game?
[264:41.84]Yeah, I'm not selling it very well, am I?
[264:47.48]I'm not selling it.
[264:52.44]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[264:59.79]Oh, wrong door.
[265:13.74]You're the reason E3 disappeared?
[265:15.40]What did I do?
[265:16.36]What did I do?
[265:21.03]What did I do specifically?
[265:23.05]What do you mean?
[265:23.53]I did that.
[265:27.67]Yeah, I watched it in my underwear a few times and said, oh, this is kind of goofy.
[265:33.61]And I cheered at a few of them.
[265:35.08]What did I do?
[265:35.58]How is me watching E3 in my underwear and making three comments about one of the games?
[265:47.40]Done.
[265:50.76]Gone.
[265:54.16]Shoot one cross.
[265:54.86]Yeah, it's too much pain in the ass to reload.
[265:58.70]Found a note.
[266:03.45]Next time I won't miss.
[266:09.65]OK.
[266:16.42]It's gonna end up being a good character that's trying to help us and warn us about things.
[266:25.55]Look.
[266:27.03]Wooden door, I guess.
[266:28.15]I don't know.
[266:32.81]Gas up there.
[266:33.51]I don't care.
[266:43.38]A hallway and then... So a torture exhibition.
[266:46.52]A history of law enforcement through the... I don't... Whatever.
[266:57.73]Lay them both back and tell me that that was not the same exact voice line.
[267:01.39]I win.
[267:09.45]Where do I go?
[267:15.21]Depressed E3 host.
[267:21.19]Yeah, you don't want to use this one for your E3 presentation.
[267:24.79]Yeah, guys, over the last couple of years, I just fucked off and ignored everybody and fucking... I don't give a fuck, you know, whatever.
[267:32.42]Like, no, can you please talk about the game?
[267:34.14]Go into the atrium.
[267:35.04]No, no, no, don't talk about this.
[267:51.17]Why won't you stop talking about food?
[267:54.24]You feel a coldness, evil, yet you're captivated by the unearthly aura.
[267:58.68]Do not be deceived.
[268:02.56]Uh, I'm not gonna, in real life, if I see floating yellow gas, I'm not gonna run over there and be like, ooh!
[268:11.29]Oh, I wonder, is this food?
[268:12.63]Where's this coming from?
[268:13.35]Oh, you know what?
[268:14.17]I think it's probably barbecue.
[268:16.77]Who's gonna fucking do that?
[268:19.22]Do not be deceived by the disgusting floating yellow odor.
[268:23.33]Oh, wait, whoa, you could have fooled me!
[268:24.89]It's a video game, bro?
[268:36.93]I don't care, it needs to be real!
[268:48.05]The soil is dry and the leaves riddled with parasites.
[268:51.13]Ugh.
[268:51.83]Whoever cares for it has neglected their duty.
[268:53.69]Ooh.
[268:57.61]You would start floating with your eyes closed as you sniffed.
[269:04.09]Oh, what the fuck?
[269:05.51]Presented by Archie Duke, Lord Mayor of London, 1796.
[269:08.53]The plaque reads...
[269:16.62]What the fuck did I just do to the statue?
[269:25.86]Okay.
[269:27.50]Oh!
[269:28.92]Gun.
[269:34.56]I need to save the game right now.
[269:41.42]A tremendously powerful weapon.
[269:52.93]We found some bullets.
[269:54.29]Yeah.
[269:54.83]Just want to let you know, if you're here... I'm armed!
[270:13.74]That would be a good time to... Turn around and...
[270:22.85]Put your tail between your legs and fuck off!
[270:27.05]Oh my god!
[270:27.61]Oh my god, somebody got hurt!
[270:28.67]Oh my god, I'm gonna run!
[270:31.27]Oh my god!
[270:47.99]He's running.
[270:52.01]Oi!
[271:05.79]I got the torture room key.
[271:15.01]These goons seem to be looking for something or someone.
[271:22.94]Okay, the natural history exhibition lies behind this door, but it's locked.
[271:37.02]No, you've ruined it.
[271:38.17]Cut.
[271:41.06]Back up.
[272:01.28]Alright, do you think you'd break all your bones?
[272:02.95]Do you think you'd break both your ankles if you ran and jumped from the top of that as far as you could at the bottom?
[272:08.49]Sick.
[272:19.55]Where's the torture key?
[272:23.33]I think it's maybe back in the atrium.
[272:37.15]Are you still doing the E3 bit?
[272:38.69]No, I'm just a livestreamer.
[272:41.47]We don't ever stop talking.
[272:44.17]Because we're terrified that if we stop talking, you'll leave.
[272:47.83]You'll find somebody better and more entertaining and more funny than me!
[272:52.84]So if I stop speaking, you're just gonna leave!
[272:57.04]I can't stop!
[272:59.36]See?
[274:23.52]I think I found it.
[274:24.22]Yeah, I think I got it.
[274:25.58]Can I just take stuff from here?
[274:26.76]What the f- No, I want to take that.
[274:54.34]Why can't I take... He said, do you want to take stuff from his inventory?
[274:56.82]Why can't I... Do not shoot him.
[275:00.84]I would have been able to get it.
[275:07.93]Sobriety test.
[275:08.69]Please spell the alphabet backwards as fast as possible.
[275:11.83]Z-Y-X-W-T-Q-S-R-T-K-L-M-O-P...
[275:24.36]M... H, G, I, C, B, D, A... Close enough.
[275:42.97]I just got arrested.
[275:45.03]Apparently.
[275:47.87]Get in the car, sir.
[275:57.78]How do you do that?
[275:59.82]Oh my god.
[276:00.54]I saved it, right?
[276:09.75]The torture room.
[276:10.69]Look at all this fucked up stuff.
[276:14.85]What are they doing to people in here?
[276:16.23]They're torturing that guy.
[276:27.81]I don't know.
[276:52.07]It seems this hideous contraption was recently disturbed, but it is shut tight.
[276:56.81]You know, this wasn't even used in ancient Europe, whatever.
[277:01.09]This wasn't even used.
[277:02.74]It's fake.
[277:03.80]Shut up, Jerma.
[277:04.42]You're an idiot.
[277:07.06]Okay.
[277:11.90]I don't want to waste the bullets.
[277:26.91]Oh no.
[277:29.43]The most heinous contraption of all of medieval Europe.
[277:36.76]A chair!
[277:37.20]I must sit in the chair.
[277:42.66]Oh, the agony!
[277:43.34]A metal chair.
[277:45.78]It's cold!
[277:48.39]It's cold!
[277:51.31]Help me!
[277:57.71]Be careful.
[278:01.01]This guy's gonna get out and attack me.
[278:11.45]There's a rusty bolt.
[278:12.64]Do you wish to release it?
[278:18.72]Yes.
[278:18.92]No!
[278:21.68]No, you fool!
[278:35.99]Nice instructions.
[278:42.21]There's a bolt on the side of Stocksby.
[278:44.20]Please release it.
[278:46.40]Oh, hold on.
[278:47.74]By the way, let me make sure this is really clear.
[278:51.90]There's another bolt that will cut off my head and release gas into the room.
[278:55.80]They're right next to each other and they're both identical.
[278:57.68]But be careful.
[278:58.30]Press the right one.
[278:59.48]The one that releases me.
[279:06.20]Oh.
[279:07.04]My.
[279:08.54]God.
[279:12.43]What the hell is this?
[279:13.59]It's a fucking death pendulum.
[279:19.69]No human should ever be subjected to such devilish treatment.
[279:27.22]That thing is gonna get me right in the head.
[279:38.37]The way the camera is set up right now, there's not a chance in the hell that when I press this button, this doesn't go right through my head.
[279:46.76]There's no way.
[279:49.32]There's absolutely no way.
[279:53.13]I have to see.
[279:53.77]There's a small hole.
[280:00.83]Maybe not.
[280:18.45]Okay, well it's not this way.
[280:21.03]This game is pretty great, actually.
[280:22.99]I think this one is an absolute winner.
[280:24.77]I'm loving it.
[280:26.18]This is good.
[280:37.00]Oh shit, that's going on the Steam page.
[280:54.41]Go back to the Iron Maiden.
[281:03.94]Whoa!
[281:06.12]You weren't kidding.
[281:06.72]I just walked up to this and it didn't do that.
[281:17.06]You found a rusty crank.
[281:25.25]How devilish.
[281:30.55]Oh, is this thing that you lay down and it stretches you back out?
[281:33.79]You know what's funny?
[281:34.31]I actually... I like want someone to do this to me.
[281:39.21]Does this sound weird?
[281:41.82]I want someone to do this to me, but stop.
[281:44.56]At a particular place.
[281:49.68]I want to lay down and be connected to this and have it be like...
[281:56.11]And then it's like, oh, oh, okay.
[281:57.55]Stop right there.
[281:58.21]It would feel nice up until a certain point.
[282:12.36]As long as it was safe, I guess.
[282:20.31]It kills you.
[282:21.33]Yeah, it kills.
[282:21.91]I'm saying do it very lightly.
[282:27.92]This is wicked fucked up.
[282:31.00]Actually... Uh... Ow.
[283:00.37]Uh-oh, I think I fucking broke... I'm moving the health bar.
[283:11.11]I thank you.
[283:17.17]You died to the chiropractor?
[283:19.07]Wait, is this an item?
[283:20.11]Is it an item?
[283:20.78]No.
[283:25.02]What do I do with this?
[283:27.10]Wow!
[283:27.52]Whoa!
[283:28.26]Wowie!
[283:44.46]Why does the main character look like you?
[283:48.04]Because he's a white guy with brown hair.
[283:52.26]Okay, there you go.
[283:54.49]He's a white guy with brown hair and a thin face.
[283:56.49]Alright, dodge.
[284:16.49]Yeah!
[284:18.80]Alright, do I get anything else from this?
[284:19.76]I'm gonna save it.
[284:24.04]I thought that was gonna hit me in the head.
[284:28.76]Abdul!
[284:29.44]Abdul!
[284:31.52]You have no idea what I've seen!
[284:33.02]Abdul, please!
[284:39.10]Abdul.
[284:40.28]There was a guy in there.
[284:40.90]There was two guys in there.
[284:41.86]There was somebody in the Iron Maiden.
[284:42.94]There was somebody with the Iron Maiden.
[284:44.84]And then there was somebody that was attached to the fucking thing and it chopped him in half, Abdul.
[284:49.49]And then there was other people in cages up there on the top of the rafters.
[284:52.45]It was fucking crazy, man.
[284:54.72]I don't know what else to do.
[284:55.38]I don't know what to tell you, man.
[284:56.30]Do you have any menthol I can breathe in to help me?
[285:14.05]He's doing his machinima arc?
[285:16.29]Machinima bit?
[285:26.68]Uh-oh.
[285:30.42]You're addicted to mint?
[285:31.24]That's fair.
[285:39.09]Smelling salts?
[285:46.37]We're really reliving the 2010s.
[285:48.27]Well, don't you understand?
[285:50.55]All of you that grew up with the Machinima stuff, I am now doing, I am doing the remakes here.
[285:57.48]I am doing, I am hitting your nostalgia by doing a 2010 style playthrough of this game.
[286:04.12]See how ahead of the fucking curve I am right now?
[286:09.06]I am going to pull that back, and you're going to have nostalgia for 10 to 15 years ago, and I'm bringing it to you right now.
[286:22.58]Open up, open up in there.
[286:24.65]Damn, I nearly had her.
[286:27.15]Quit you idiots.
[286:28.31]Find a key to this door.
[286:30.60]I'll make sure she don't double back this way.
[286:55.54]What the fuck?
[286:56.30]I'm still loading the gun!
[286:57.56]I shot him in the fucking head!
[287:03.27]I shot the guy behind him?
[287:07.45]Oh!
[287:07.51]Don't move.
[287:18.10]Give me all your money.
[287:19.22]And I want you to leave this place, and I don't want you to ever come back, and I want you to take that World of Warcraft blunderbuss piece of shit, turn it sideways, and shove it up your ass.
[287:50.03]Saving the bolts.
[288:04.22]I'm crazy!
[288:05.02]I'm crazy!
[288:05.76]I'm crazy!
[288:06.72]I'm crazy!
[288:07.78]I'm crazy!
[288:08.28]I feel like if you charge somebody screaming that with a club in your hand, I feel like you're gonna fuck them up a little.
[288:32.19]I'm having way too much fun with this game, honestly.
[288:34.33]It's just, I don't know, it's doing it to me.
[288:36.17]I don't know why.
[288:36.77]Uh, library or should I, let me try the library.
[289:21.41]Stream's been a lot of fun.
[289:22.09]I'm going to try some of these games out later.
[289:23.83]That's good.
[289:26.93]Like we said earlier... A lot of these games are... They are labors of love.
[289:34.24]They really are.
[289:37.80]I really do think that this was an... I know I'm going to... That's quite a take, Mr. 40-year-old.
[289:43.66]I think a lot of games back 20, 10, 20, 30 years ago... I think a lot of them were just labors of love.
[289:57.55]Is that for the... all the way at the beginning?
[289:59.73]Even if they weren't very good.
[290:01.09]That's the thing.
[290:01.52]Even if they weren't that good.
[290:11.78]And then we could go... You want to go down this road of what happens when art becomes publicly traded?
[290:18.15]Yeah, we could go down that road and... Okay, we're going to go down that road.
[290:41.31]Now let's go down that road.
[290:42.73]No, I'm not going down that road.
[290:45.95]That road's got potholes all over it.
[290:47.29]It's bumpy.
[290:48.93]Somebody pulls up next to you on the road, rolls that window down, says, hey, roll yours down too.
[290:53.07]Yeah, you look over.
[290:54.19]Fuck you!
[290:55.76]Oh, by the way, I'm going to crash into you too.
[290:58.46]What are you doing?
[290:59.50]No, I'm crashing into you.
[291:11.52]One of these books is slightly out of place.
[291:23.21]Can you please go a day without crashing out?
[291:26.37]Watch the Chrono Trigger streams!
[291:28.43]That's me with my fuckin' hand down my pants.
[291:31.40]Like, just sittin' there like Al Bundy, alright?
[291:55.90]None of you even know what Al Bundy is?
[291:57.67]Fucking kids today.
[292:00.63]These kids today.
[292:01.85]This game is unironically good.
[292:16.90]It is.
[292:22.76]Why do you do this to us?
[292:25.49]Oh, the mods.
[292:26.25]Yeah.
[292:26.75]Oh.
[292:28.27]Right.
[292:28.67]Uh.
[292:30.13]Yeah, sorry.
[292:30.69]Did I tell you that a long time ago when I was a kid?
[292:45.96]I thought... Can I kick this down?
[292:49.60]I can't Dark Souls kick this down?
[292:53.24]Uh, I... That song... I thought it was... I don't know why.
[293:01.83]This is because I was a kid and I didn't know.
[293:04.33]I thought they were saying... Love and cabbots, love and cabbots.
[293:11.77]Go together like a horse and cabbots.
[293:16.63]I thought they were saying... Carrots.
[293:20.47]But, like, carrots.
[293:22.35]Lovin' carrots.
[293:29.30]It's kind of like, carrots.
[293:32.66]Today, we finally enter the tomb.
[293:34.40]For years, we have waited for this moment in the last few months of the dig.
[293:38.00]Perhaps the most arduous of all.
[293:43.33]with my wife at my side we shall take the next steps into a place where man has not set foot for nearly two thousand years who knows what treasures await us what knowledge is to be imparted it is beyond imagination just like have a cow and and it's like chickens and stuff and
[294:06.29]And I'm like, wait, what are you doing?
[294:08.25]Just like have a cow.
[294:10.77]Call it Bessie and love the cow and enjoy the interesting life that you have.
[294:22.11]And plant like an apple tree and watch it grow.
[294:24.89]God damn it, watch it grow.
[294:29.62]It takes like 150 years for an apple tree to grow.
[294:32.08]I'm making that up.
[294:32.76]I lied to you.
[294:33.52]I have no idea.
[294:34.36]It's probably 10.
[294:37.65]Constructed by Smith & Co.
[294:38.93]of Plumstead, a well-known manufacturer of quality safes.
[294:43.99]Did you take DMT on one of the breaks?
[294:46.03]No.
[294:50.77]I'm just having fun.
[294:56.41]You have found the West Wing Corridor Key.
[294:58.40]Do you wish to take it?
[295:00.34]Yes.
[295:02.80]I haven't saved in a long time.
[295:09.80]Right when I need you.
[295:10.44]Come on, Abdul.
[295:14.27]Yes!
[295:15.07]Oh, Abdul.
[295:17.11]To the rescue.
[295:17.67]I love this guy.
[295:23.35]Have you said anything about why facecam isn't on?
[295:33.40]Yeah, I smashed my webcam.
[295:34.92]I did it on cam.
[295:35.84]I just was like,
[295:37.30]Look at this!
[295:38.36]Look at this, Den!
[295:39.46]Look at this!
[295:40.26]I just, like, kind of smashed it a bunch.
[295:47.80]Such valuable books should surely not have been abandoned in such a fashion.
[295:50.67]Yeah, I was like, gaze upon this, Den!
[296:00.23]Gaze upon this!
[296:07.81]But ironically, this is something I didn't realize at the time, to show that disdain for that, I had to have a webcam on me.
[296:16.27]So I had to buy another webcam to be on webcam smashing my webcam.
[296:21.85]I just didn't realize that that was kind of, I had to buy another one.
[296:26.37]And it's still set up.
[296:27.07]It's right here.
[296:28.61]I might use it from time to time every so often.
[296:36.46]Like, wouldn't it make sense, you know, horror games and random fun days or whatever?
[296:46.53]This is technically a horror game.
[296:49.23]It has stopped and there's a small crank in the glass case.
[296:51.49]The hands read 826 PM.
[296:57.44]Somebody remember that, please?
[297:04.36]13 left, 2 right, 6 right.
[297:06.35]Somebody remember that?
[297:08.19]Remember both those two things, please.
[297:38.64]Strong oily odor is coming from the painting, but it must have dried years ago.
[297:42.04]Alright, where, let me look at the map, actually.
[297:45.94]I got a key.
[297:52.58]I got West Wing key, desk drawer key.
[297:58.76]Will fit the drawer in Victoria's desk.
[298:00.68]Alright, the West Wing key.
[298:09.36]I got another break coming up, and it is likely to be the last break today.
[298:14.46]And I'm gonna really make the Chrono Trigger fans very sad.
[298:19.14]Uh... Because I think I want to keep playing this.
[298:24.55]I'm having a ton of fun playing this.
[298:30.43]So we will start with this tomorrow, and we will end with Chrono Trigger.
[298:37.09]Now, if you were to have a- if you were to collectively pull the webcam footage of everybody that's watching right now, how many of you at the same time just said, Yeah, right.
[298:46.99]Like, yeah, okay.
[298:48.95]Whatever.
[298:49.37]It was probably in unison.
[299:07.09]You never keep your promises.
[299:08.61]I will play Chrono Trigger tomorrow night.
[299:11.03]I will.
[299:14.79]I gotta get back out.
[299:15.41]Wait, I gotta get back out to the west wing.
[299:22.26]This is locked too.
[299:25.48]What the heck?
[299:30.20]And Zakuza 0.
[299:30.94]It's fair.
[299:40.11]That's fair.
[299:50.40]Main staircase.
[299:51.20]Okay.
[299:52.58]Now I was gonna say, how can I not go in here?
[300:10.70]What do you order when the ice cream man visits you?
[300:13.50]Oh, hold on.
[300:14.52]I'm coming up on the break here, so that's going to take a few minutes to talk about.
[300:18.11]You're going to get a real rant today.
[300:23.51]Oh, here it comes.
[300:27.85]Everybody set up a new chair.
[300:40.59]This is locked.
[300:43.73]Now what isn't?
[300:44.23]I don't want to get a cut scene.
[300:50.87]We're going to stop right there because there's a guy.
[300:59.39]I heard you blow a snot bubble and it popped.
[301:05.50]You can chill.
[301:09.79]Yeah, we'll go for like another half an hour or so, 45 minutes.
[301:12.79]I'll get to the next major area and save it.
[301:15.91]I am in this one for real.
[301:19.49]I'm loving this big time.
[301:21.06]The other games were great too.
[301:23.02]Just this one's doing it for me.
[301:25.48]And when you catch it, the best part about these old games is when you find one after you play, oh, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten of them in a row.
[301:32.30]It's like, wait, I got one.
[301:34.94]And I'm going to play this one probably all the way through.
[301:41.11]So last break of the evening I will be back.
[301:45.56]See you in a few minutes.
[307:30.73]I'm back.
[307:31.95]And I didn't even say that their ads playing.
[307:35.96]I admit I gotta run him again.
[307:37.18]I should I gotta run another.
[307:39.66]I gotta run him again.
[307:40.84]We didn't know they were going on, so I have to run again.
[307:47.72]Where am I going?
[307:51.27]Right here we go.
[308:07.87]I have not had... I have not healed one time.
[308:09.79]How long have I been playing this game?
[308:11.07]Like two hours?
[308:14.79]The reigning monarch of Victoria.
[308:16.47]Her stony gaze does little to lighten your heart.
[308:22.21]Button on the back.
[308:24.55]Oh, ice cream.
[308:25.73]So when you hear...
[308:34.51]And you run out there, you run out there and you push all the kids aside.
[308:37.11]No, me, me, me!
[308:47.96]Uh, there are a few options.
[308:49.40]There are... What's he... I thought that... Is that... Oh, it's not me.
[308:57.01]I thought he was... I don't know how I thought he was strangling me.
[309:08.68]Okay.
[309:11.70]So, he puked.
[309:16.50]It is... in this exact order.
[309:20.86]It's the tier list, right?
[309:21.96]Because usually that... a lot of ice cream trucks... By the way, for all you weirdos here, all the weirdo fucking people, I have to make this statement.
[309:31.06]No, I haven't gone to an ice cream truck in probably 25 years.
[309:35.41]So like, oh, when I went to the ice cream truck like yesterday, why is he so weird?
[309:39.50]Just shut up.
[309:41.00]Okay?
[309:41.52]And listen.
[309:44.52]Here's in this particular order.
[309:48.88]If they have it, and by the way, when you look at the ice cream truck, it says... Oh, there's an X on this.
[309:53.81]We don't have this anymore.
[309:54.67]Fuck.
[309:54.99]Okay, I gotta go to the next tier.
[309:58.62]Tier number one is the Spider-Man ice cream bar with the bubblegum eyeballs.
[310:04.80]Or I will take a Sonic the Hedgehog substitute or a SpongeBob substitute.
[310:10.51]That is number one.
[310:11.39]That is S tier.
[310:13.55]Anything else I don't care about.
[310:15.31]If those are not there,
[310:19.43]Then it goes down the list.
[310:21.99]Down the list, we've got now the Rocket Pop.
[310:26.25]The red, white, and blue Rocket Pop.
[310:28.72]It's a super easy choice.
[310:30.32]It's wonderful every time.
[310:32.14]That's probably, I'd say, next.
[310:35.80]After that, it is the Shark Lemon Bar.
[310:39.04]The Shark Bar.
[310:41.31]The Lemon Lime Popsicle.
[310:44.74]If that is unavailable, then we go to Choco Taco.
[310:48.66]The problem with Choco Taco is why it's always kind of, that's up there for me, but it's always near the bottom of the up there list.
[310:54.60]Mainly because you take a bite out of it and it disintegrates into your hands.
[310:58.99]You take a bite of a Choco Taco and like a nuke goes off in your fucking living room.
[311:03.07]Like it's just, that's just the way it is.
[311:06.37]So if you're going to be going somewhere or doing something, you don't want to get it all over you.
[311:12.11]There it is.
[311:12.71]That's my list.
[311:17.59]In fact, they don't even make the shark popsicle anymore, and I know that some people have tried.
[311:24.72]Some companies have tried to formulate it, and... Oh, look, we make our own version of it.
[311:29.34]It's not the same.
[311:31.38]It had a very distinct lemon... I was going to say... I don't want to say this because it sounds like I'm saying something derogatory about it, but I'm not.
[311:42.76]I don't want to say this because it's going to sound like I'm making a derogatory statement against this particular food item.
[311:49.02]But no, but it's why I like it.
[311:53.84]It's like super, yeah, zesty.
[311:55.82]It's like, it's, it almost tastes like... Gun.
[312:02.82]I was going to say shit for a second.
[312:05.13]I was going to say shit.
[312:06.03]I was going to say shit because this guy was going to get up.
[312:10.65]Good thing I said gun.
[312:20.41]It tastes like shit!
[312:33.13]Do I not have a key?
[312:37.95]Dude, this is like the second time you... You hit enter too early.
[312:48.89]Desk draw key.
[313:11.78]Okay, where's this gone?
[313:19.88]I can't get in there?
[313:20.54]What is this?
[313:21.08]What?
[313:25.21]Come on.
[313:28.79]Uh, but yeah, it's like a citrus... Like... Like, yuck.
[313:37.19]It tastes like... But in a good way.
[313:55.63]Gun is worse than the club.
[313:57.34]Can I just tell you?
[313:57.84]He would have been already dead if I clubbed him.
[314:01.68]And I just, I can miss.
[314:02.66]This gun is terrible.
[314:10.36]He's still alive.
[314:11.16]This is officially worse than hitting him with a club.
[314:30.32]Okay.
[314:34.54]Let's check on the switch too.
[314:35.62]I don't know.
[314:40.13]I don't know shit.
[314:40.95]Okay.
[314:56.20]Gun's probably better for bosses.
[314:58.54]That's possible.
[315:02.23]You mean like right now?
[315:02.91]Because that was a scary noise.
[315:05.55]Is this sarcophagus?
[315:26.04]700 bucks for a .4 upgrade is crazy.
[315:42.59]Do you support Bilbo Baggins?
[315:48.31]No.
[315:49.49]Bilbo Baggins is a fool.
[316:00.30]And his grandson Frodo.
[316:03.22]Both fools.
[316:05.28]But alas, they're very important fools.
[316:14.24]So, yeah, whatever.
[316:17.26]Frodo's his nephew?
[316:20.48]We don't give a fuck.
[316:21.72]We don't give a fuck.
[316:22.92]We don't give a fuck.
[316:33.41]Somebody said, I do.
[316:38.91]Gun.
[316:39.29]Somebody's firing.
[316:51.89]I think I was supposed to get scared by that, but I controlled the game so poorly.
[316:55.24]He's actually kind of weird.
[316:59.84]Oh, he's moving weird.
[317:01.62]I don't like it.
[317:11.36]And you're going to put a second one behind him?
[317:15.26]Give me the amulet.
[317:27.78]His head is gone!
[317:28.72]Shoot his head off!
[317:44.40]Bro, you can't handle the amulet?
[317:45.58]Yeah, I can.
[317:48.69]If you gave me the one ring, I could handle it.
[317:50.79]I think I could, for sure.
[317:51.56]I mean, yeah, you'd probably watch me just be like, Slay them!
[318:00.46]But I'll be fine.
[318:02.75]Slay them all!
[318:03.19]Slay them all!
[318:18.60]You would pee your pants and run away.
[318:20.12]No, I wouldn't.
[318:25.56]I... would become a dead nox!
[318:43.47]I would be Venom, but good.
[318:44.69]Yeah.
[318:46.05]Uh-oh.
[318:48.51]That's not good.
[318:51.33]The worst scare of them all.
[318:53.83]Stuck in the game environment.
[318:59.39]Heavy sarcophagus, stones, it's edges... Great.
[319:11.99]If I got in, I can get out.
[319:23.86]If I got in, I can get out.
[319:25.14]Damn it!
[319:55.04]Get a chance to see Minecraft.
[319:57.14]I highly recommend it.
[319:58.90]And they said it was violent.
[320:01.07]I don't think it was violent.
[320:02.41]I played the game so well, too, and I have to go back to the old save?
[320:06.57]I actually was playing really good, and that's not like I'm dying and losing because I'm playing bad.
[320:14.47]I might have to, though.
[320:18.35]I think I'm actually screwed here.
[320:30.66]I believe.
[320:33.58]Well, I was going to stop soon anyways, and this is the stopping point, so I might as well really try it and get out.
[320:43.25]I walk up this.
[320:44.70]Is this intentional?
[320:46.58]It feels weirdly intentional.
[321:04.06]I think it's over.
[321:11.85]That's unfortunate.
[321:14.47]Maybe shoot the gun?
[321:15.29]Spin, maybe?
[321:15.87]I gotta catch the lip.
[321:24.32]That bottom lip is what I have to catch on.
[321:40.95]There's gotta be an angle.
[321:41.75]I mean, I got in, right?
[321:58.02]No, I think that's it.
[322:00.18]Come on!
[322:03.13]Do pause buffering?
[322:12.49]It's a good idea.
[322:12.95]Alright, well, remind me tomorrow not to do this.
[322:23.55]If you see me go near this thing, we need a red alert.
[322:26.73]Because I will walk in the same sarcophagus.
[322:28.39]Because we're absolutely playing this tomorrow.
[322:34.40]And I'm going to keep going on it.
[322:36.68]And then we can play Chrono Trigger.
[322:43.56]I'm having genuinely a good time with this.
[322:44.90]This is a very fun game.
[322:47.06]Wait.
[322:52.02]I thought it was right there.
[322:55.60]Looks like I'm kind of clipping through it a little.
[322:58.64]I wasted so many bullets though, no.
[323:01.36]Alright, we'll be live tomorrow.
[323:03.20]Starting probably around the same time.
[323:06.44]Like 1.32pm.
[323:16.01]4D element was violent, not the movie.
[323:18.33]Oh, OK.
[323:18.79]I was going to say how that.
[323:20.69]Minecraft movie doesn't sound violent.
[323:24.80]Yeah, about tomorrow to 2 o'clock.
[323:27.88]Picking this up exactly where we left off.
[323:29.44]I actually might even just walk over to where the sarcophagus is.
[323:40.99]Thanks for sticking around.
[323:41.85]Thanks for watching.
[323:44.46]Oh, by the way, there will be... Polly and I actually sat down and did a full breakdown and rundown of all the emotes and all the animated slots that I have on the channel.
[324:02.31]Because subs have not gotten anything in two to three years.
[324:06.37]And before that, it was like six.
[324:09.45]So I'm kind of starting the process now of having like 25 new emotes.
[324:15.28]I want a bunch of animated emotes.
[324:17.28]I want to make some funny ones.
[324:19.70]At least, you know, funnier than the, you know, ancient nine-year-old memes that are still available.
[324:28.75]Whatever gets removed at my discretion will end up on a BTTV.
[324:36.25]So you're not going to lose most of them.
[324:37.95]They'll just go to BTTV.
[324:40.97]There's a lot more relevant things that are worth putting an emote in the chat for.
[324:47.44]I broke down this three or four emotes that are used on this channel.
[324:52.06]Every other emote is used when I bring it up.
[324:54.74]It's the only time it's ever used.
[325:05.85]The planets better not be leaving.
[325:07.71]The planets will always be a sub emote.
[325:10.03]Always.
[325:17.77]Those things can never, ever go away.
[325:21.33]There's too much sentimental value on those.
[325:23.35]Oh my God.
[325:23.73]I don't know.
[325:24.75]The credits are supposed to be rolling.
[325:35.66]Okay.
[325:35.90]Sorry about that.
[325:41.41]Hey, credits.
[325:49.27]I want to give some more value to the subs.
[325:57.94]So 20 to 25 new emotes of different things.
[326:00.60]I want at least a few more animated ones.
[326:13.34]Right now, what you get for subbing here is just... Hey, remember this joke from nine years ago?
[326:19.95]Oh, yeah.
[326:20.43]Okay.
[326:23.59]I guess when sub-only chat happens twice a year, you get that, too.
[326:37.41]need some auto yeah there will be a few auto related ones there's even um excuse me uh leaking an emote already one of the animated emails is going to be auto crunch or auto auto talk it's going to be give auto a treat and film it so when he's like opening his mouth and closing it and animate it so it's a gif of just like open up close up and open to close
[327:03.78]Because I want more emotes to be used that are relevant, that make sense to use.
[327:08.92]Like, for instance, jermaTV, that emote, what is the purpose?
[327:14.54]It's just, oh, hey, remember that time where I fell down with a TV?
[327:18.18]When do you use that?
[327:19.04]What moment is that?
[327:20.52]When do you do that?
[327:31.42]When technology is crushing you.
[327:39.34]It's when you get crushed by something in the game.
[327:41.12]If you remove jermaTV, I'm gonna unsub.
[327:51.06]Yeah, I... I... It'll be on BTTV.
[327:55.49]Maybe I'll keep it, just to make myself angry sometimes.
[328:04.19]Don't remove this.
[328:04.85]Don't remove that.
[328:05.43]Don't remove that.
[328:05.99]Don't remove that.
[328:08.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[328:12.59]Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow around two o'clock.
[328:14.53]We'll get back to this and then possibly some Chrono Trigger.
[328:21.23]Yeah, keep that in your head.
[328:35.15]Possibly when I get tired of.
[328:38.87]Curse the island of.
[328:42.70]Curse it's curse the eye of ISIS.
[328:46.28]When I get sick of that game.
[328:48.96]We'll play corner sugar, but who knows?
[328:50.22]I don't know.
[328:50.54]I had a lot of fun with it.
[328:51.22]I want to maybe I'll beat it.
[328:52.72]Can't imagine it's that long of a game.
[328:54.06]Probably like 10 to 15 hours, maybe 30 or 40 hours.
[329:07.31]Yeah, had a fun one.
[329:08.25]Good time.
[329:08.97]Hope everybody had a good time.
[329:11.59]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[329:18.92]Remind me to, I gotta like, okay, now thinking about like the Twitter thing again and thinking about my social media presence on all these accounts that I have.
[329:26.05]I need to like put in like the Twitter, like my Twitter bio, like, hey, like archived guy or something.
[329:33.49]I don't know.
[329:42.35]I think it still says, like, oh, hey, man, like, videos and streams frequently, and here's my email, and here's the business email, and here it is, and I'm live fucking four days a week.
[329:52.24]I mean, I kind of am, but... Oh, also, also...
[330:11.91]Go subscribe to the second channel.
[330:14.66]Do we have a link to the second channel here?
[330:16.04]I think it's down there somewhere.
[330:18.44]Second channel is putting out some uploads.
[330:22.91]A lot of uploads going out there now.
[330:25.19]That's the official highlight channel.
[330:28.11]Go sub to the archive channel.
[330:29.97]They've put a lot of shit up there too.
[330:36.58]What happened to your first channel?
[330:37.54]The first channel is a museum.
[330:39.38]It is never to be used again.
[330:45.71]Do I have a link to the YouTube second channel?
[330:52.05]I think it's down in the description.
[330:55.79]Yeah, it definitely is.
[330:56.48]It's down in the description.
[330:59.76]Go follow that channel if you don't for more Jeremiah985 content.
[331:09.21]They've been putting up a lot of stuff recently, so.
[331:14.24]You ever going to make another video?
[331:15.38]I've wanted to.
[331:20.28]I made that mac and cheese video and I just was, I was just making it and laughing at like sound effects.
[331:27.71]But I wouldn't call that a real video.
[331:32.37]That was like just me messing around and having fun while I was not really live or doing anything.
[331:54.26]Yeah, the Jerma, the it's the Jerma stream archive, I think is the title.
[332:01.04]I'm going to put that down there too.
[332:02.20]I'm going to, there'll be a, I'm doing a revamping of some of my, um, that down there kind of about me page.
[332:09.71]I'm just going to clean it up a little bit, add some things, add some more links.
[332:16.33]I'm not going through a, I've been doing this for far too long to be like, oh no, now that I like retired two years ago, came back to streaming a little bit.
[332:24.98]And I'm in this new period where I'm just doing whatever I want and whatever.
[332:27.80]I don't care.
[332:28.24]I don't know if it's time for a rebrand.
[332:30.64]That doesn't make any sense.
[332:31.86]Like I'm just here doing it for however long I want to do it.
[332:38.74]So, I'm just going to clean it up.
[332:40.09]Make it look a little more modern.
[332:42.93]Because some of the things... Oh, subscribe and get the egg emote that nobody uses.
[332:52.93]Just going to do a little spring cleaning.
[333:09.11]I'm still having a lot of fun with it.
[333:11.80]Like I said, coming back, I just said I'm going to have fun and I'm going to do whatever I want and now we're doing it.
[333:21.84]I'm having a great time.
[333:23.36]It's been fun.
[333:36.32]And all I had to do is say, I don't care.
[333:42.97]And I had my little disappearing act.
[333:49.69]I think for good reason, too, though.
[333:51.66]Sometimes you just need to disappear.
[333:57.00]And however long I do this, I don't know.
[333:58.64]I don't know either.
[334:00.38]But I'm just going, and I'm just having fun.
[334:11.89]Take it easy.
[334:12.51]See you tomorrow.
[334:13.24]Have a good rest of your night.
[334:16.79]Give your mother a call.
[334:19.61]See you.
