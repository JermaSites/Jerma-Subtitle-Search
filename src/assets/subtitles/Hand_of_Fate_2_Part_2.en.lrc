[ve:60.16.100]

[01:01.95]Good evening.
[01:03.33]Hey.
[01:04.61]How are you?
[01:05.53]Hey.
[01:13.64]And that's it.
[01:14.52]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[01:15.48]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[01:17.54]Enjoy your night.
[01:18.52]And bye.
[01:19.10]No.
[01:19.84]Hi.
[01:20.24]How are you?
[01:23.08]So.
[01:24.65]My name's Jeremy, and we got some things to play tonight.
[01:28.00]And we don't have a PC to build, but here's the PC to build.
[01:30.14]It's tomorrow, even though I said, uh, yesterday that it was gonna be tomorrow.
[01:35.82]And then the day before that, or two days before that, it was supposed to be on Wednesday.
[01:39.70]And then, like, a week ago, I said Sunday.
[01:42.75]So, like, there's a magic... There's a magic force at play here that keeps making this push forward a day every day.
[01:50.77]But... But...
[01:54.15]That's over.
[01:55.03]That's over now.
[01:56.37]It's done.
[01:56.83]Tomorrow is the actual day.
[01:59.29]There was one thing I had to get right.
[02:02.58]One fucking thing I had to get right.
[02:05.02]And I think I got it right.
[02:06.72]So tomorrow is the day.
[02:10.52]Tomorrow's the day.
[02:13.70]And you will see why tomorrow.
[02:16.94]Because... I'm not gonna say a damn thing.
[02:20.32]Look, tomorrow's the PC build stream.
[02:23.44]You'll understand tomorrow.
[02:24.98]There you go.
[02:25.44]That's all I'm going to say.
[02:26.14]I'm not going to be in a clown suit, although I wish I would.
[02:38.59]Sometimes I feel like a clown, you know?
[02:46.11]We're going to play Hand of Fate again.
[02:47.72]So we're pretty much just going to swap around...
[02:51.08]flip it.
[02:52.02]So you got today was going to be Hand of Fate.
[02:55.18]Tomorrow was supposed to be Hand of Fate, but now it's today.
[02:57.76]So tomorrow's PC build.
[03:01.54]Guess what, guys?
[03:02.64]Friday doesn't change.
[03:04.12]Condemned 2 is going to be Friday no matter what.
[03:07.86]And yes, tonight we are playing with Twitch integration.
[03:11.71]Twitch integration.
[03:17.37]So I hope you guys are ready to make me have like minus 10 HP every fucking 10 minutes.
[03:23.60]I can't wait for that shit.
[03:28.38]I say we kill him as revenge.
[03:35.17]Now, you'll see tomorrow why this took a little extra time.
[03:42.43]And that's all I'm going to say.
[03:45.79]Why don't we just go?
[03:47.78]Hey, Styx, thanks for the $1.
[03:50.36]Hey, Jerma, how are you today?
[03:51.26]I'm doing good.
[03:52.38]I'm doing great.
[03:52.94]Because I solved the riddle that I needed to solve for this PC build stream.
[03:58.78]The riddle has been solved.
[04:00.38]You know like the Rubik's Cube, where the kids have the Rubik's Cubes these days, and they get it in like four seconds, and they get a world record, and they get it on YouTube, and everyone's like, talks about how cool it is, and it's like, whoa, what an achievement.
[04:10.20]Like, I solved my own personal four-second Rubik's Cube.
[04:14.06]And I got it, and I like...
[04:16.28]It's crazy how they do that, by the way.
[04:19.78]They're allowed to look at it for five seconds, right?
[04:22.99]And you put it down, and then they start the timer, and you grab it!
[04:29.09]It's done.
[04:30.67]It would probably take me like six days to solve a regular Rubik's Cube.
[04:44.60]Wow, what did I do loud?
[04:47.26]I'm sorry Okay, yeah, honestly, I don't even know how to fold my laundry That's true.
[04:59.08]I don't know how to do that.
[04:59.86]I
[05:01.46]I don't understand how to fold laundry.
[05:04.32]Let me ask you guys this.
[05:05.16]Let me ask you something.
[05:06.58]When you guys do laundry, do you just kind of like crumple it up into laundry balls and then pick it out of there and hold it in front of you?
[05:17.08]I hold the t-shirt, if I'm doing a t-shirt, I hold the t-shirt in front of me, grab it with my chin, and then pull the arms forward, fold them, and then grab the bottom and pull that up.
[05:29.42]And I make like a weird cube.
[05:32.50]That's not the way you're supposed to do it.
[05:36.72]Sometimes I just dump it onto the floor.
[05:38.57]And pick it up off the ground.
[05:41.45]Because you can see it.
[05:42.57]It's all strewn out about.
[05:43.97]You can see where the pants are.
[05:45.49]What pants do I want?
[05:46.83]Not these ones.
[05:47.29]Not these ones.
[05:47.99]These ones.
[05:49.17]And you go... You shake them out.
[05:51.55]That's shaking out from the pant legs.
[05:53.05]And they're ready to go.
[05:55.16]They're ready to be put on.
[06:00.16]Anyways, this is Hand of Fate 2.
[06:02.78]What do you say we give it a try?
[06:06.73]Remove that.
[06:09.75]But I'm doing well today.
[06:10.99]I am.
[06:13.27]I had some rest.
[06:15.44]I took a little nap.
[06:16.52]I had some food.
[06:17.20]I'm okay right now.
[06:21.42]Hanging laundry in the closet is too much work.
[06:23.66]It is!
[06:26.29]You know how long it takes to put clothes on a clothes rack and a hanger and shit?
[06:32.84]Too much time for me.
[06:35.86]So we're not going to do this one because I've... Me and this guy have a little bit of a history that I don't want to do that one right now.
[06:43.68]So we're going to start with the Emperor.
[06:47.55]And there is Twitch integration.
[06:50.55]I don't know exactly what that means.
[06:55.60]I have absolutely no idea.
[06:56.66]It takes five minutes.
[07:00.68]No, not when you have... Okay, five minutes for, like, what, five?
[07:04.68]It takes about 60 seconds per piece of clothing, right?
[07:10.39]So if it takes you, like, a full minute to, like, get it where you want it, put it on the arms and hang it and then look at it while you're putting your fingers on your mouth, like, hmm, do I want it right there?
[07:18.99]No, the green's got to go with the greens and the red's got to go with the reds.
[07:24.36]Takes about a full minute.
[07:25.34]And then, so if you have 500 pieces of clothing... That takes you... That takes you 500,000 minutes.
[07:31.49]I don't want to do his thing.
[07:35.07]Let's... Actually, why not?
[07:37.37]Let's do some new cards.
[07:39.92]Ones that I didn't do yet.
[07:40.74]I thought I did most of them.
[07:45.76]Actually, no.
[07:48.17]This guy, besides the dice, this guy sucks.
[07:51.83]I don't like this guy, except for his bonus dice.
[07:58.97]That's good.
[08:01.67]The shield and the range, this guy can just not get hit.
[08:06.24]Yeah, we're doing that.
[08:08.68]We can continue his quest.
[08:10.94]We still have to beat Burning Building, we still have to beat Kartofka, we still have to beat Market Thief, we have to beat everything.
[08:17.97]I want to beat those gnomes.
[08:19.41]Fuck the gnomes.
[08:20.01]I want to win that card.
[08:20.89]Let's see.
[08:25.03]The Old Maiden's free stuff.
[08:27.29]I didn't figure out this one yet, really.
[08:30.81]Watchtower and... Friendly and Keeper.
[08:41.37]One more, right?
[08:46.24]This one is like an easy win kind of What the hell are you guys doing Sometimes I just look over at the chat and I'm just like what the hell is happening I see you guys doing like a hashtags hashtag like join We haven't even done the Twitch integration yet Let's get some weapons in here
[09:18.95]Ruby Ring, Ring of Food.
[09:20.29]Yeah, that's fine.
[09:21.31]Let's do five.
[09:26.23]No.
[09:29.68]No.
[09:32.14]Axe.
[09:33.16]Let's take it with us.
[09:33.76]Alright, here we go.
[09:37.54]Thieves have stolen a relic from the Emperor's Palace.
[09:41.01]Hmm.
[09:41.21]Hmm.
[09:41.51]Okay.
[09:41.67]Okay.
[10:08.87]Well, let's just start it.
[10:10.36]Twitch integration is on, so you're gonna get your ABCs here.
[10:13.66]I can't wait to get, like, fucked.
[10:24.17]It's gonna be fun.
[10:25.07]Here we go.
[10:27.17]No, don't do it yet.
[10:29.97]Don't do it yet.
[10:30.67]Don't do it yet.
[10:31.15]Don't do it yet.
[10:31.67]You guys are gonna vote accidentally.
[10:33.57]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[10:36.10]Don't do- Don't hit A. You're gonna accidentally vote for something in about five seconds.
[10:54.81]recruitment drive.
[10:57.03]The surreal voice of the town crier rings out across the market square.
[11:01.27]The Emperor himself seeks adventures, Guild members.
[11:04.95]Urgent expedition vital to the safety of the Empire.
[11:09.56]You spot a crowd of travelers weighed down with weapons and tools lingering nearby.
[11:15.36]The Empire is offering a reward just to set off on the expedition.
[11:20.84]Even more if we make it back.
[11:23.34]That's how desperate they are for help.
[11:26.55]The dealer adds a gold counter to the map.
[11:30.75]Okay, a gold counter.
[11:34.23]The Empire does not ask for much.
[11:36.37]Cast your vote.
[11:37.12]But in the end, they take everything.
[11:39.42]You guys, I get to get free stuff?
[11:42.63]Oh my god, okay, cool.
[11:44.38]I'll take the plus 20 fucking gold, please.
[11:50.12]Look at this.
[11:54.48]On arriving at the gates of the royal palace, an armed escort leads you directly to the emperor's chambers.
[12:00.01]The emperor remains still and silent as his chief council lays out the expedition.
[12:06.37]few relics from the last age still endure in this world we had one in this very room until last night it's a it's a it's a girl she gestures to an empty pedestal not only must you reclaim the stolen symbol of our power we ask that you gather its three sibling relics uh okay explain that you're ready no who stole the artifact
[12:33.08]Okay.
[12:33.26]Let's look at the pedestal.
[12:35.36]I believe you can only vote once, so... An ornate pillow sits atop a stone pillar in the dust.
[12:40.31]You make out the shape of a jagged blade.
[13:03.31]It was a ceremonial sword.
[13:05.17]It sat for decades under our protection.
[13:07.65]We're not protecting it, you understand.
[13:10.19]What?
[13:11.53]Oh, you just, like, told me two completely different things.
[13:14.81]We're protecting those who would try to possess it.
[13:17.64]The blade is cursed.
[13:19.04]Its venom strikes both wielder and foe in equal measure.
[13:24.44]So it's a chaos blade.
[13:26.78]You got it.
[13:27.48]I'm ready to go.
[13:29.08]Hold it, Venturer.
[13:30.60]It took skilled and dangerous thieves to steal the artifact.
[13:33.92]We need to ensure you'll be safe out there.
[13:36.42]See our training officer on the way out.
[13:38.06]Alright, did I win?
[13:40.16]When do I get it?
[13:40.52]I don't think I get that gift for a long time.
[13:43.91]I think I have to play the game for like an hour before I get that.
[13:58.95]You are greeted by Captain Estrella Fiore.
[14:00.95]Okay, well...
[14:20.59]I did not even need to take it.
[14:30.50]Okay.
[14:31.34]So these are just better versions of the dual blades.
[14:35.42]Stun Thief.
[14:35.84]Perform six strikes that cause stun to Thieves.
[14:38.92]Stunned enemies take 150% damage when hit.
[14:42.06]Okay.
[14:43.32]So if you repost a Thief, they deal more damage.
[14:45.93]You got it.
[14:46.65]Put it on.
[14:52.34]Oh my god.
[14:59.24]Well, this opened up a lot.
[15:03.92]Your quest takes you far away from the city.
[15:05.90]Vast wild lands stretch out before you.
[15:09.85]Your companion reminds you of the Emperor's mission.
[15:13.15]One relic was stolen by brazen thieves.
[15:15.13]Another is in the clutches of a shady merchant.
[15:17.97]One is enshrined in a tiny northern village.
[15:20.35]As for the last, who knows?
[15:22.39]Alright, well, we're going to do this.
[15:29.47]How come other people... Who's playing Monopoly with me?
[15:33.65]You got the guy, you got the dog, you got the thimble, and you got the house, the hotel.
[15:40.17]What are those?
[15:42.98]Are those the relics?
[15:44.50]No.
[15:45.60]Alright, let's just go around the circle like a spiral.
[15:49.70]The open wilds.
[15:52.53]The wilds are welcoming.
[15:53.45]They're bounty plentiful.
[15:55.87]In the bed of a river, you find some discarded coins.
[16:00.45]Okay.
[16:04.69]Ah, shit.
[16:06.77]That sucks for you, buddy.
[16:08.35]You just landed on Baltic Avenue.
[16:11.57]oh wow if I land on your space it's gonna be like a three dollar rent get the out of here even with like four hotels on those it's like a hundred bucks I'm about to get on park place baby park place attention leaves the disaster I will buy that inch of the wilderness is peaceful come on that was funny
[16:35.93]The wilds are sometimes treacherous and harmful.
[16:38.63]Hey, listen.
[16:40.23]He who owns the railroads dictates the pace of the game.
[16:45.25]Don't ever forget that.
[16:48.25]You pluck some juicy wild berries from a thorn-covered thicket.
[16:51.94]The realization they are poisonous arrives far too late.
[16:55.76]Ow.
[17:00.17]Alright, let's keep going.
[17:01.70]Gnomish exchange.
[17:04.42]Okay.
[17:04.88]Here come... I get to do the voice again.
[17:12.06]Remember last time?
[17:13.50]I get to do this again.
[17:14.22]Alright, let's get a different... What's a gnome voice that I could do?
[17:20.03]Gnome voice.
[17:21.81]Um...
[17:23.47]It's so typical to do that.
[17:24.93]We'll do that one.
[17:25.55]Yeah, sure.
[17:25.91]Help, vile humans.
[17:29.17]A horse calls out as a dozen small horses leap from the trees around you.
[17:32.33]It takes a moment to realize they are gnomes.
[17:34.96]Dirty, poorly armed gnomes.
[17:36.34]A few hold spears, but most have only a rock or a sharpened stick.
[17:40.86]We seek arms to defend ourselves, a gnome declares loudly.
[17:44.96]Hand over some of your equipment and we'll release you.
[17:47.68]We can even pay you something.
[17:50.62]I'll give you some food for a helmet.
[17:53.11]Now, give me some armor and I'll give you a health potion.
[17:56.71]The gnomes all loudly shouting their own offers, trying to drown each other out.
[17:59.47]Alright, I have to give them something.
[18:02.81]So, I'm gonna give you a shitty warrior's axe.
[18:06.53]Because... Who cares?
[18:10.60]You know, who cares?
[18:11.72]This thing sucks.
[18:15.08]You surrender the equipment to the gnomes, satisfied, they offer payment in return.
[18:20.46]Alright, well, that's... I did not know that was gonna happen, so this is... Wow.
[18:25.68]Okay, remind me if I ever need money that this card is, like, free money if you have a shitty weapon.
[18:31.84]The gnomes retreat to the forest with their prize and soon begin fighting over it.
[18:35.66]You gain two fame.
[18:40.68]I have that equipped already.
[18:42.60]Twitch chat integration!
[18:43.76]Hey, vote on something!
[18:45.00]And, like, 30 minutes later, I'll see ya.
[18:48.76]Look, we're doing a spiral, like I said.
[18:51.51]I have no food.
[18:52.41]Starvation has been the end of many adventurers.
[18:55.29]What?
[18:56.69]Oh, I need to like camp and trade.
[18:59.95]On the longest night of winter, the townsfolk of Steigle set up around a large, huge bonfire to celebrate the victory of light over darkness.
[19:07.29]The one night the empire turns a blind eye to the outlawed use of magic.
[19:10.93]So how do you actually do this card correctly?
[19:15.99]Quick, change your votes to C. Change your votes to C. I'm going to have too much money.
[19:22.17]You join a group of peasants close to the fire.
[19:24.15]Taking a sip, the woman beside you offers you a goblet.
[19:27.21]You politely accept the pungent potion and take a quick swig.
[19:30.47]Warmth rushes through your body and you fall into a deep hypnotic... You get fucked up on drugs.
[19:37.01]You need a blessing card to do this one.
[19:40.15]Well, you actually can change your vote.
[19:45.72]That's self.
[19:47.06]What kind of election is this?
[19:53.59]You guys just get to sit in the booth?
[19:57.11]You guys get to sit inside of the booth and watch the news to see what president looks like they're gonna win.
[20:04.00]A sweating traitor comes up to you, jogging in from the darkening wilds to join your campfire.
[20:13.79]Thank God you're here.
[20:14.87]I don't know how to start a fire.
[20:16.09]It's my first time traveling ever.
[20:18.90]Let's trade.
[20:20.00]Buy some food.
[20:20.64]I have a lot of money, so we're gonna just buy it all.
[20:23.97]And you guys are about to gift me some food.
[20:29.85]Yeah, and, like, not only, like, an election, this is just, like, this is, like, insider trading in the stock market.
[20:37.72]I don't, I do not want that.
[20:38.78]That's good.
[20:43.32]Like, I told you guys the price of the next stock that was gonna climb, and we're all gonna get arrested.
[20:50.61]This is fine, break camp.
[20:51.55]Alright, I told you, spiral.
[20:57.31]Friendly innkeeper.
[21:00.91]Back to A. Buy, buy, sell, sell.
[21:08.96]This really is the stock market.
[21:10.10]I'm looking at the chat, people are like, go to A, A, quick, get A. No, no, no, back to C.
[21:19.81]No, no, no, stay on, stay on C. Stay on, oh, no, A. You actually, no, no, I have enough money.
[21:27.05]Welcome back, my friend.
[21:28.09]The innkeeper greets you warmly, yeah.
[21:30.63]Buy food.
[21:32.46]Uh-oh, look at this.
[21:34.32]Yeah, he's, he's crashing the market.
[21:37.54]Back to A. Quick, make this worth it for me.
[21:43.48]Back to A. Let's crash the fucking market.
[21:49.13]I got a lot of food now.
[21:49.99]No, I want five more food.
[21:52.23]I need a lot of food for this mission.
[21:59.53]I'm good.
[22:04.48]Let's keep going around the spiral.
[22:08.48]Alright, here we go.
[22:09.34]I'm gonna get it, right?
[22:10.72]Good fortune.
[22:12.20]Here we go.
[22:13.72]Here's another one.
[22:15.85]Alright, this one is minus 15 health, minus 10 gold.
[22:19.05]No, no, don't sell.
[22:20.21]Don't sell.
[22:21.17]We just bought stocks.
[22:22.27]You don't sell it immediately.
[22:32.38]It's just the stock market.
[22:33.60]If you put the stock market in your blanket, it's my life.
[22:36.52]Now, the wilds are sometimes treacherous and harmful.
[22:41.70]Don't hurt me.
[22:43.18]Oh my god.
[22:43.84]While traversing a dangerous cliff face, you slip and lose your footing.
[22:47.58]Though relatively unharmed, the same cannot be said of the pack of traveler's rations that broke your fall.
[22:54.15]Oh, shit.
[22:54.73]Sorry, just one food.
[22:55.59]Alright, we're about to see the, uh, we're about to fight the thimble, whatever this is.
[23:01.77]More treacherous wild.
[23:02.46]The wild is sometimes treacherous and harmful.
[23:04.88]You pluck some juicy wild berries from a thorn-covered thicket.
[23:07.96]They are poisonous.
[23:12.00]So, you're stuck.
[23:14.54]Oh, let's damage the streamer.
[23:17.52]Oh, here we go.
[23:24.28]Sell.
[23:29.93]Uh, yep.
[23:30.79]Somebody bumps into me.
[23:32.27]Somebody takes my shit.
[23:34.37]I lose 10 gold.
[23:36.55]That's okay.
[23:39.04]Where are they?
[23:44.03]I have no idea.
[23:45.85]I think it was... I'm never gonna get this.
[23:52.52]Oh wait, hold on, I can ask the audience!
[23:54.90]I can ask the audience!
[23:56.40]So now you guys can't give me shit if it doesn't work, okay?
[24:03.18]I don't know if a Regis can just ask the audience.
[24:10.55]Alright, I was gonna say four.
[24:14.28]Should I go with the audience?
[24:20.54]I'm gonna go with the audience.
[24:23.09]You guys fucking... Come on!
[24:27.81]Thanks a lot, audience.
[24:37.81]I don't think I should listen to the audience, considering that, like, I... You're gonna get it wrong just as many times as I got it wrong.
[24:48.60]Yeah, I lost $10.
[24:50.46]I'm never going to get that one.
[24:53.30]I got plenty of food.
[24:54.24]We're good.
[24:54.74]Keep going around the corner.
[24:55.77]Dangerous wire.
[24:57.49]Well, we're going to fight.
[25:00.33]Light weapons are weak against Empire armor.
[25:02.07]I don't have anything else, so we have to just go.
[25:06.35]Let's fight.
[25:10.47]Dude, that's so funny that you guys could just vote for that forever.
[25:14.27]And you can change your vote forever.
[25:16.97]There's not going to be a chat.
[25:22.29]You guys should just open up somebody else's channel and chat in there.
[25:28.98]Cutthroat's blades.
[25:29.68]A lovely pair of fine blades fit for the finest gentleman.
[25:32.24]Well sharpened, well cared for, and deadly.
[25:36.93]Here we go!
[25:41.85]Oh, I can't even hurt these guys.
[25:46.37]Oh wait, I forgot to play the game.
[25:47.41]I forgot how to play this game.
[25:56.13]Alright, come on, magician.
[26:06.50]Stop that blocking.
[26:08.84]Oh my god.
[26:09.58]Why did I just look at the Twitch integration?
[26:15.54]Oh boy!
[26:16.12]Alright, give me my shield.
[26:28.17]He surely wasn't lying about these not working well against these guys.
[26:41.79]Although I do keep thinking that those projectiles are bad.
[26:48.31]Oh, the super is not bad.
[26:55.81]What?
[27:02.94]And you go on 47% to 45% for 20 more gold.
[27:03.98]I love how that 7% of you want to take $10 from me.
[27:12.63]And you're not going to change your vote.
[27:15.13]Like, come on.
[27:16.91]Let me ask you something.
[27:18.47]The 6% of you that have not changed your vote from A, what are you, voting for Ralph Nader?
[27:28.40]See, now I talked about it, so now the stock goes up.
[27:30.38]The price goes up on that stock.
[27:42.64]No, I don't want equipment.
[27:46.52]Oh, shit.
[27:47.10]Ralph Nader's gonna win the presidency.
[27:49.96]Hold on, wait.
[27:50.80]Cartographer, open wilds.
[27:52.14]Alright, it's not down that way.
[27:59.78]Uh, how am I doing?
[28:01.60]I'm okay.
[28:03.86]Open wilds.
[28:10.03]The delightful aroma leads you to a troop of hardy morals.
[28:13.39]Use them to prepare a nourishing meal.
[28:15.03]Nice.
[28:16.47]You guys didn't even need to vote for that, and I got it.
[28:20.43]More dangerous wilds.
[28:23.47]One-handed weapons are recommended against northerners.
[28:26.18]This is where I want to put on this shit.
[28:31.70]Winter's Bane.
[28:36.96]Let's kick some ass.
[28:44.08]What was wrong with C?
[28:44.84]What happened to C?
[28:45.52]You see the game I'm playing, guys?
[28:51.02]What happened to C?
[28:51.72]Like, nobody cares about C anymore?
[28:53.04]This shit is so stupid.
[29:12.21]Oh shit, wait, Swamp Thing is here.
[29:18.81]I forget.
[29:23.19]Come on, Swamp Thing.
[29:33.79]And... goodbye.
[29:37.87]Right in the back.
[29:38.77]Stick it to him.
[29:40.09]Suck it to him.
[29:46.49]Vote B. I think in the long run, I think B is going to win out here.
[29:51.55]You battle with resolve.
[29:56.23]And you gain an equipment card.
[29:57.45]Okay, okay.
[29:59.15]Ring of food?
[30:00.03]I'm going to do ring of food.
[30:02.78]Because I'm going to be walking around all over the place.
[30:10.08]Health potion.
[30:10.66]Gain 20 life.
[30:12.36]Um...
[30:14.67]I'm going to discard this to get food.
[30:18.27]Alright, here we go.
[30:21.25]Let's see what the house does.
[30:24.21]Temple relic.
[30:27.83]The village of Dunkirk is unremarkable, save for a tiny, near-forgotten shrine.
[30:36.19]Here you find another relic resting on a dusty altar.
[30:39.25]An old woman greets you.
[30:41.57]So the Monopoly pieces are the relics?
[30:49.34]I see you are interested in our relic.
[30:53.13]Local legends tell of a time when a great hero will come to claim it.
[30:58.69]Until then, it remains here under our watch.
[31:05.00]I'm that hero.
[31:06.56]The woman scoffs.
[31:08.74]You are not the hero we were promised, though I do sense greatness within you.
[31:14.32]I speak of nobility in you.
[31:17.79]Return to us when your soul burns brightly.
[31:20.81]Alright.
[31:25.11]That's fine.
[31:26.26]I got plenty of time.
[31:27.10]What do I need?
[31:27.48]Fifteen fame?
[31:29.79]You leave the temple behind planning the return once you've achieved greater fame or are better prepared for a fight.
[31:34.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:41.22]I wanted to... I can't go that way.
[31:47.94]So it is these.
[31:49.38]You fucked up my whole route here.
[31:51.24]My whole route is screwed up.
[31:53.32]Burning building.
[31:53.95]Alright, here we go.
[31:57.23]Kill A, fuck B, marry C. You hear shot?
[32:08.00]Alright, let's go in the burning building.
[32:12.98]Flames and smoke billowing out of its upper room windows.
[32:15.22]A crowd is formed.
[32:18.52]I'm gonna brave the fire myself.
[32:21.81]Alright, let's do it.
[32:23.29]Yeah, I know.
[32:23.87]So... We need to get... Just one of these two will be okay.
[32:27.83]Okay, there's one.
[32:28.79]Good.
[32:29.01]Confirm or choose again.
[32:30.43]One of toil.
[32:30.94]I don't get it.
[32:32.24]Confirm, right?
[32:32.72]What?
[32:51.69]Yeah.
[32:52.07]Oh, okay.
[32:52.53]I can re-spin.
[32:53.75]I get it.
[32:54.01]Alright, I got it.
[32:57.27]So I rescued somebody.
[33:02.18]Through a haze of smoke, you find the woman's youngest daughter crying under a bed.
[33:06.00]You coax her out, scoop her up, and carry her out of the blaze.
[33:10.08]Give me that coin.
[33:12.55]A villager rushes to your aid.
[33:14.25]Thank you, brave adventurer.
[33:15.65]I can take it from here.
[33:17.21]But be warned, the building is not safe.
[33:18.79]It will soon collapse.
[33:21.60]The woman embraces her child and turns to you once more.
[33:24.38]My husband!
[33:25.10]Did you see my husband?
[33:27.74]Yes.
[33:28.76]Go save the husband.
[33:29.80]I can get this.
[33:31.44]Or maybe I can't.
[33:33.04]Now it's going faster.
[33:33.90]Oh, shit.
[33:38.19]I'm not gonna... Yes, redraw!
[33:43.33]Got it.
[33:44.29]Oh, yes!
[33:44.77]Thank God.
[33:47.25]I gotta get this one more time.
[33:55.58]You find the woman's son attempting to find his way out through the smoke and flames.
[33:58.56]Grabbing his hand, you lead him back through the building.
[34:02.54]A villager rushes to your aid.
[34:03.50]Thank you, Brave Adventure.
[34:04.46]I can take it from here.
[34:05.24]But be warned, the building is not safe.
[34:07.05]It will soon collapse.
[34:09.45]The woman embraces her child.
[34:10.85]Where's my husband?
[34:16.27]Oh, goddammit.
[34:17.25]I don't even know where to stop this.
[34:19.59]I wasn't even close!
[34:21.05]I wasn't even close!
[34:22.93]Oh my, how the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[34:28.88]Perhaps you should have taken your time.
[34:32.60]You hear a shrill cry as a beam in the next room collapses.
[34:35.45]The fire claims a victim.
[34:40.61]While you were unable to save everyone, the villagers are grateful.
[34:43.41]Good thing I didn't get hurt.
[34:44.77]That's so hard to do, that whole thing.
[34:48.17]Let's go do this because I now have the fame for it.
[34:50.95]Now I'm famous enough.
[34:55.12]Yep, here.
[34:56.20]Claim that I'm the hero.
[34:58.06]The woman examines you for a moment before falling to her knees in prayer.
[35:01.44]You have arrived.
[35:02.58]Justice foretold.
[35:03.92]Our savior.
[35:06.46]You got the dark ring.
[35:11.11]The new wielder of this item will gain a curse.
[35:13.65]And I can't get rid of it.
[35:17.34]Corrupt healers lose gold whenever you receive life.
[35:25.92]Good thing we have the ring of food.
[35:27.70]Looks like bees back on the menu, boys.
[35:36.09]The relic is cursed.
[35:37.65]Who would want to steal such a thing in the first place?
[35:39.85]Let's just continue my route that I was doing.
[35:45.22]Actually, I'm gonna go up.
[35:47.54]Shifty sales sense of trust for wandering merchants True bargains are rarely found with those who are find the traveling salesmen wandering the wilds their wares Okay, buy the relic negotiate a better price Well, okay, so here's what's gonna happen everyone vote for B. I'm gonna go down and then back up Make your best offer if you win the price will reduce by the total of the dice if you lose he may refuse to sell the relic to you and
[36:19.92]I gotta think about this.
[36:20.60]No.
[36:20.76]Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[36:22.46]So, B, I'm gonna go down, and then up, and then I'll have, I'll have, uh, 20 extra dollars.
[36:29.26]So, do not, that's really close right now.
[36:36.60]So, here we go.
[36:37.16]I'm gonna go down, and then I'm gonna go up, and I'm gonna get 20 gold.
[36:44.90]Let's not forget, he pushed his PC stream build three times.
[36:50.61]No, forget about that, because that's happening tomorrow.
[37:00.70]What happens if it's a tie?
[37:04.54]It doesn't matter, I still win.
[37:20.34]The wilds are sometimes treacherous and harmful.
[37:22.38]Now we go back and I haggle and I buy it.
[37:31.84]It's poisonous.
[37:32.54]I'm going to take a little damage.
[37:33.49]My axe health, that's not cool.
[37:37.27]Now I'm going to go back up.
[37:38.85]And this is where we haggle.
[37:41.43]And we get our relic.
[37:42.77]Negotiate a better price.
[37:45.59]Alright, haggle.
[37:46.53]Let's reduce the price.
[37:49.92]We need to get more than five.
[37:51.50]It's going to be so easy.
[37:55.62]Okay.
[37:57.24]Relic price reduced by eight.
[37:59.36]Negotiate.
[38:01.86]Got some rare things on sale, stranger.
[38:05.52]They like Resident Evil 4.
[38:06.54]It's a great game.
[38:07.28]I don't blame them for making a reference.
[38:10.88]Let's haggle again.
[38:12.23]Vice 12.
[38:16.79]Oh.
[38:17.89]Oh, shit.
[38:21.68]Oh, shit.
[38:23.90]Try it again.
[38:24.58]Come on.
[38:26.48]Oh, eat my ass.
[38:27.62]This is bad.
[38:31.83]The merchant takes offense at your attempts to take coin.
[38:33.97]The salesman will no longer sell the relic.
[38:36.15]Alright, well, now I'm just going to take it.
[38:44.37]Despite your threat of violence, the merchant seems nonchalant.
[38:48.25]He smiles and says...
[38:50.99]One does not operate this far from civilization without insurance, stranger.
[39:01.10]You ready yourself for combat.
[39:03.36]These are a bunch of thieves.
[39:06.00]So we're going to have to use the cutthroat blight.
[39:14.50]Looks like minus 10 health is currently winning.
[39:18.91]Yeah, have you guys ever heard of B on your keyboard?
[39:22.92]Capital with a hashtag?
[39:24.28]That's a lot of B. This is a lot of fucking... Okay, I can't fuck this up.
[39:29.14]Take this slow and smart.
[39:34.12]Okay, I apparently was... Stop!
[39:46.61]What?
[39:49.87]These fire wielders gotta go.
[39:54.27]Ow, geez.
[40:00.78]And then the ninjas have to go.
[40:01.78]Well, these things are way more useful against these enemies.
[40:10.81]For sure.
[40:23.86]Ayah!
[40:31.36]Oh, come on, I was gonna do the fucking thing, man!
[40:35.25]Alright, go get Princepy!
[40:38.67]He's gone.
[40:42.98]Hey, thank you, Clink!
[40:44.90]For the one dollar.
[40:48.05]Uh, they say.
[40:49.39]Not this time.
[40:50.28]What happened?
[40:51.02]Before you give away everything that is critical, you cannot hope to win.
[40:54.84]What happened?
[40:55.56]What happened?
[40:56.02]What happened?
[40:56.36]You are your own worst enemy here.
[40:58.10]After dispatching his bodyguards, you turn toward the shifty salesman.
[41:02.86]What?
[41:04.82]Someone in the Empire must really want this back.
[41:07.70]He says while gently rolling the relic in his hands.
[41:10.44]I imagine I could make someone very unhappy by doing this.
[41:14.98]He throws the relic to the ground and crushes it under his foot.
[41:23.72]Why?
[41:25.74]Can I slit this guy's throat?
[41:33.54]While I... I'm so... okay.
[41:37.37]While I'd have preferred to profit from this encounter, I'm willing to settle for petty revenge.
[41:49.22]So... That's... Alright.
[41:53.66]Well... I guess you have to pay for it.
[41:58.80]You have to pay for that, which relies on haggling a price down with dice rolls.
[42:05.55]If not, then you can't win it.
[42:09.01]He smashes it like a child.
[42:11.37]Like an angry child, he breaks it.
[42:17.23]Dangerous Wilds.
[42:20.73]One-handed weapons there.
[42:21.77]Northerners that are about to attack.
[42:24.16]So let's put on this Winter's Bane.
[42:29.62]And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:33.24]Let's go.
[42:39.37]I'm about to lose 10 health here in a couple steps.
[42:41.31]That's good.
[42:43.91]Look who's talking.
[42:48.70]And it's Empire and Northern as well.
[42:50.98]They're working together.
[42:54.52]Am I, am I like reuniting all the clans?
[42:59.99]Yeah, this real fucking asshole.
[43:02.51]We usually hate each other and want to take over each other's lands and shit, but... Fuck this guy.
[43:15.46]The northerners are so easily dispatched with the Knight's Bane, whatever the hell this thing is called.
[43:19.72]Oh, what?
[43:30.97]No eye invisibility frames?
[43:35.09]Bullshit.
[43:38.67]So what are you voting for?
[43:39.61]You're voting for the top right?
[43:41.20]A, B, or C?
[43:44.42]You're voting to take 10 health from me, give me 10 health, or remove 3 food.
[43:51.63]I can discard this for food.
[43:54.53]I'm going to.
[43:55.07]I have a lot of food now.
[44:00.31]Just in case you guys try, just take it from me.
[44:04.75]Distressed Damsel.
[44:07.55]Yep, this is the one that you gotta get over a 14 dice roll to help her.
[44:12.24]Let's get it.
[44:16.45]Well, that's not gonna work.
[44:22.67]Oh my god.
[44:25.88]No.
[44:26.52]Come out, boys!
[44:28.38]I don't wanna... A group of bandits spring out.
[44:36.65]He's trying to sway the health away.
[44:38.93]Don't fall for it.
[44:50.11]Yeah, so I have a question.
[44:51.55]Anybody that knows how twitch.tv works.
[44:55.75]Is there a way that those messages won't show up in chat?
[45:00.84]I think they have to, because it won't get recorded.
[45:03.24]Because there's like currently a Hand of Fate bot that's in the channel, right?
[45:09.24]Or like part of the channel right now.
[45:11.00]Doesn't it need to record all the data?
[45:13.66]I guess it has to be like that, huh?
[45:16.53]Oh my god, I'm like not paying attention.
[45:23.89]You have to filter it with VT... TV.
[45:27.25]Oh my god, I'm like reading- Stop reading chat and fucking fight!
[45:37.41]Better better Twitch.
[45:38.41]Better twitch.tv Okay Yeah, I mean well that that that's good.
[45:43.29]So I guess there's no if you're on like if you're on like BT TV Then I guess you can like blacklist those so they don't like show up in your chat, I guess But with that search for valuables
[46:03.12]Seven sup a sip seven their Star Trek character named seven like literally called seven of nine Victory you were learning for fame five food three food Cool, and let's just keep going around and I guess we have to talk to that guy Let's go up
[46:32.76]The wilds are sometimes treacherous.
[46:35.75]Watch out.
[46:36.63]You fell and lost some food.
[46:38.25]Alright, what's it going to be, guys?
[46:44.04]Oh, I lost 10 max health.
[46:48.71]It's alright.
[46:49.19]Because now it doesn't matter what you choose.
[46:52.19]I win.
[46:53.67]I gain no matter what.
[46:55.07]So, choose whatever you want.
[46:57.51]I would say... I would say C is probably the most worthy of your investment.
[47:07.54]So this is his questline.
[47:09.52]This is the continuation of his quest.
[47:11.76]The journey comes with some confusion regarding logistics and food.
[47:16.07]What do children even eat?
[47:17.85]Molocalypse Head cried.
[47:19.66]In the end, you managed to bring the mage children safely to the Madmen near Forstford.
[47:25.38]Their home is an ominous-looking building with high gates, barred windows, and faint screaming coming from within.
[47:31.10]It passes as an asylum, disquieting... Disquaintly... Disquieting... Disquietingly... Well, what the... What word is that?
[47:41.93]Disquitely... Disquaintly... Disquaintly...
[47:45.92]Right.
[47:46.70]We'll just drop these little munchkins off and be on our way to get to that cure.
[47:51.00]Milocalypse leads your ragtag bunch to the main door before turning to you and saying seriously, Please, perform the secret knock.
[48:00.59]Wrap the door in ten quick bursts or knock a tune.
[48:05.55]I would... That's this.
[48:07.31]That's... Is that ten?
[48:12.08]That's what I would do.
[48:14.54]Hold on.
[48:20.88]Let's do it.
[48:23.06]Wrong!
[48:25.46]Then he merely pushes open the unlocked doors.
[48:28.85]You are met by two tall men, identical twins, dressed in patterned nightgowns.
[48:35.53]Ira of the Vale told us you'd be coming, one of the twins says.
[48:38.91]I'm Barry, and this is Mary.
[48:40.91]They call us the Mad Men, but it is only a name.
[48:44.30]They shove you aside and hurry the children indoors.
[48:47.90]We're good sorts, aren't we, Barry?
[48:50.03]His twin nods as he brushes the children's hair and hands them nightgowns.
[48:54.85]Yes, indeed, but sometimes I forget we're merely acting, and I do mad things like setting that farm on fire.
[49:00.87]Keep the raffles off our trail, though, don't it?
[49:03.21]Mary nods as he brings out a plate of warm spiced breads.
[49:07.64]As the children warily settle down to eat spiced breads and butter, Mary asks you a favor.
[49:13.12]Well, in your own glaring out this place, hasn't been an orphanage for a long time, has it?
[49:17.94]Not fit for children.
[49:19.06]Not at all.
[49:19.46]Not fit for children indeed.
[49:20.40]The monster's in the burning rooms, Barry.
[49:22.30]Barry notes while cutting carrots.
[49:25.67]Hmm.
[49:30.47]Extinguish the burning room or kill the monster.
[49:40.16]I'm going to say the burning room.
[49:42.92]Because if I don't extinguish the burning room, then the whole place is going to light on fire.
[49:48.47]Monster can be dealt with.
[49:49.37]He's probably reading a newspaper in some room somewhere.
[49:54.45]Extinguish the room.
[49:57.87]As you approach the stairs, a man in rags rushes past and barrels into an adjacent room.
[50:03.35]He peers at you with mad eyes.
[50:07.02]That would be Freda.
[50:08.50]He kept trying to climb Frostborn's clock tower, and so they sent him here.
[50:11.60]He's harmless.
[50:13.32]Frida slams the door closed, then open, then closed again.
[50:17.70]You arrive at the burning room.
[50:19.80]The room is literally on fire.
[50:21.84]Everything has been reduced to ash inside.
[50:24.14]Somehow, magic is keeping the fire contained within.
[50:26.86]Hmm.
[50:34.96]Uh...
[50:38.58]I'm gonna ask him what to do Perhaps that's the answer he points to a chubby lizard like creature the size of a small dog It watches you cautiously from the corner of the room a Fire salamander a hatchling at that I'd have thought them long extinct Try to placate the flame creature Fuck
[51:08.59]Lord I Would say I'm gonna say it's one of these two I think it's two but I don't know Look at how spread out the chat is on this This is so evenly everybody is so evenly incorrect.
[51:31.93]It's remarkable.
[51:32.77]I
[51:41.80]I was gonna say two.
[51:51.33]Alright, I'm going for it.
[52:01.32]The fiery creature stares at your offer but refuses to budge.
[52:04.12]Can we do it again?
[52:07.66]Try to placate the frame creature.
[52:09.73]Okay, we can do it again.
[52:13.43]It's three.
[52:14.25]I don't even need your help.
[52:16.27]God damn it!
[52:33.00]You've been at it so long that the creature now appears less afraid and more bored of your presence.
[52:37.29]It sniffs around the ashes for something to eat.
[52:43.69]I lost so many times without getting a huge failure that I can do it again.
[52:56.54]He's just... I'm sitting there.
[52:58.14]Okay, right now, I have my knees bent.
[53:01.30]I'm staring at him with my hands out and clapping on my knees being like, come here.
[53:06.92]Come here, listen.
[53:08.28]Come over here, little good boy.
[53:09.70]Come here, Mr. Good Boy.
[53:10.84]And he just doesn't care.
[53:12.16]He's just like, oh my god, this guy's fucking annoying.
[53:20.69]I'm gonna have to go with the audience on this one.
[53:24.63]Yep.
[53:28.19]And they didn't.
[53:29.53]Is that your final answer?
[53:31.96]You coo and offer cake to the fat little lizard.
[53:34.82]Intrigued, it waddles over to the doorframe, licking its lips.
[53:38.42]You notice the flames recede as it approaches.
[53:42.28]The fires have been extinguished, but the room continues to smoke and smolder.
[53:45.82]We're okay.
[53:50.78]We can go in now.
[53:52.89]With the salamander calm, the flames recede and the room becomes cool enough to enter.
[53:56.75]The chubby creature clambers up your leg, snuggles into your arms, gibbering softly to itself.
[54:04.52]The little beast gags and convulses in your arms until, with a tiny squawk, it coughs up an item that drops painfully onto your toe.
[54:13.34]That's a big item.
[54:14.44]Oh, of course.
[54:16.78]Okay, well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.
[54:23.83]Cool.
[54:25.01]On the advice of Melocalypse, those ones are prone to spontaneous combustion.
[54:30.42]I would let him go.
[54:32.04]You release a little creature outside.
[54:34.62]It gives your palm a warm little lick before it patters away to the cliffs nearby and jumps and dies.
[54:42.18]With that dealt with, you return to the kitchen.
[54:46.54]Mary boils sheets in a massive steel vat while his brother prepares radishes for the stew.
[54:51.06]I already like these two.
[54:53.32]Their tummies full of warm bread, the children find comfortable spots around the kitchen to nap.
[54:59.25]Go kill the monster.
[55:01.35]Barry leads you down to the cellar door.
[55:04.54]It's in there.
[55:05.44]I've had to resort to going down to town to buy our pickled vegetables.
[55:09.14]They scream like banshees when I ask them what blood they've pickled them in, though.
[55:14.09]Barry closes the door behind you.
[55:16.20]You follow the steps deep beneath the fortress until you find yourself in an underground cave.
[55:21.16]You hear a guttural moan.
[55:25.36]Well, this guy is going to be easy.
[55:29.38]Easy.
[55:32.27]Hey, how's that vote coming up there?
[55:34.01]You're going to see the outcome in another 30 minutes.
[55:41.29]Get the new hammer.
[55:43.13]We got the giant, we got the judge gavel.
[55:46.11]Speak softly and carry a huge piece of iron on the end of a stick.
[55:50.79]And I judge you... Guilty!
[55:58.90]Criminal justice system works!
[56:04.54]Oh god, darn it!
[56:11.71]Yes, I lose gold when I'm healed.
[56:13.21]I have a curse.
[56:19.55]I think we are going to get this, though.
[56:21.27]You poke at the dead thing to see if it holds any treasure, but find nothing of value.
[56:25.43]Melocalypse rubs his shoulder nervously as he gazes into the creature's cold, dead eyes.
[56:31.98]Well done.
[56:32.80]You've win.
[56:34.24]Congratulations, you've win.
[56:36.77]You yell across the table that the stew is delicious.
[56:38.91]What?
[57:04.25]He says there's too much carrot in the stew, Malocalypse joins in.
[57:08.62]The madmen look at each other confused.
[57:11.54]No, we can't marry you.
[57:17.84]Yes, I will marry you, Malocalypse replies.
[57:19.94]He reaches for his lute.
[57:22.90]It's real, Armstrong Wood.
[57:25.43]Thank you for noticing.
[57:31.79]Hee-hoo, ha-ha, hee-hoo, hoo-hoo, hee-hoo.
[57:34.44]What's your opinion of it?
[57:35.68]General calamity, isn't it, Berry?
[57:37.84]Berry shouts as he hands out hunks of bread.
[57:40.52]Berry nods.
[57:41.82]I wouldn't think they saw bad if only they didn't try to kill us all, magic folk.
[57:46.01]Not to mention what they did to those poor lizardmen.
[57:50.67]I remember when my silk trader was a lizardman.
[57:54.07]Now they're all dead, except for the bloke holding the city.
[57:58.63]Weren't the lizardmen wiped out centuries ago?
[58:04.18]Barry scratches his crooked nose.
[58:05.74]At least you think he did.
[58:06.78]He's so very far away.
[58:10.34]Yes, it has been a while, hasn't it, Brian?
[58:13.48]With the problems resolved, Mad Men insist you stay for supper.
[58:17.22]Seated on opposite ends of a comically long dining table.
[58:20.06]Yeah.
[58:22.48]Finish eating supper.
[58:25.45]As you finish your stew, Molocalypse brings out his loot.
[58:29.73]After the second song, the Mad Men politely suggest that it's time for you two to leave.
[58:35.28]Children giggle at the bard's silent word.
[58:41.62]With the mage's children peering out behind them, the madmen near forced forward wave goodbye from their front door.
[58:47.94]You gain fame.
[58:48.84]As the door closes, your companion collapses on his hands and knees, blood oozing from his mouth.
[58:54.55]He pulls himself wearily to his feet and groans.
[58:58.63]This cure can't come soon enough, coin slave.
[59:06.27]As they say, let's get it.
[59:10.61]The open wilds are welcoming their bounty plentiful.
[59:14.03]You feel soothed and reinvigorated by your own exploration.
[59:17.52]You gain 15 health.
[59:20.54]Take it.
[59:22.82]I'm losing money, but I need that health.
[59:25.10]Let's get this relic.
[59:26.76]Stolen relic.
[59:29.25]One more.
[59:29.65]Who hired these thieves?
[59:31.39]That is the true question.
[59:37.28]Just hold them off for a couple of minutes while we ready the horses.
[59:50.97]Thieves evade heavy weapons.
[59:52.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:53.68]I already made that joke.
[59:55.36]Can't do it again.
[59:55.92]Let's do this one.
[59:59.40]Eight people.
[60:01.34]Just gotta fight eight people.
[60:12.49]You guys have had that vote going the whole time.
[60:15.45]They all escape.
[60:18.49]Well, that's good to know.
[60:19.42]I'm going to have to make this quick.
[60:27.26]Stunt, stunt, stunning, stunning.
[60:28.30]Stunning.
[60:29.76]Stunning.
[60:36.41]Wow, I took too many hits there.
[60:46.45]Come here, come here, come here.
[60:48.33]I'm not gonna get it.
[60:48.81]I'm not gonna get this.
[60:50.73]I'm not doing enough damage.
[60:53.07]It's gonna be close!
[60:57.59]It's gonna be close!
[60:59.65]Ooh!
[61:07.96]I thought this was Shadow of War for a second.
[61:10.00]It doesn't feel like it.
[61:13.76]You've recovered a relic, you gain 4 fame.
[61:15.32]After clearing out the thieves' camp, you quickly locate the relic.
[61:18.30]That's not a lot of time.
[61:22.68]God, they don't fuck around with the combat encounters in this game.
[61:25.77]They really don't.
[61:26.67]And they did in the first game.
[61:27.93]I complained about that last night.
[61:31.47]How it's just balls to the wall sometimes.
[61:35.97]But, man, is it much more interesting and much more difficult than the last game.
[61:41.31]The last game was brainless when you got to these combat encounters.
[61:47.59]At least that's cool.
[61:50.39]The new wielder of this item will gain a curse.
[61:52.29]Let's see what it is.
[61:55.63]Lose equipment whenever you gain a curse.
[61:57.35]It's called Gremlins.
[62:00.90]The gathered relics begin to vibrate and hum, then glow with an eerie, unnatural light.
[62:05.90]The mage's tower.
[62:08.15]is now over here.
[62:09.59]Your eye is drawn to a similar glow emanating in response from a distant tower.
[62:15.51]Do you think they're trying to tell us something?
[62:17.77]Let's get moving.
[62:19.14]Head to the magus tower and find the final relic.
[62:23.34]Well, let's go.
[62:24.40]I just realized something.
[62:34.73]Oh.
[62:37.77]vote keep voting guys hey thanks what what what well this is exploiting if I'm not if I would be exploit okay okay okay don't no no no you guys no no I don't want to do this one don't don't do the fuck I have to do one which is the worst the least worst
[63:12.58]Just finish the fucking run.
[63:13.62]Nice work.
[63:13.94]Oh lord.
[63:44.91]no just just no success spin the cheese wheel as you climb the tower stairs a voice calls down from above
[64:09.95]Do you even know why you're here?
[64:12.07]How much did they tell you when they ordered you out into the wilds?
[64:17.23]Well, they sent you out here like a dog after a bone.
[64:22.11]You continue to wind your way up the tower.
[64:34.95]You finally reach the top of the tower.
[64:37.90]So you seek the final relic, the mage says.
[64:59.40]She looks upon you down and says, Are you clumsy, you foolhardy?
[65:04.30]I cannot tell.
[65:05.90]You've come this far, but you failed to bring the relics intact.
[65:09.57]And yet you continue your little errand.
[65:13.23]She holds out her hand.
[65:15.11]I guess you've come for this.
[65:18.58]Take it, but be warned.
[65:21.18]Its curse will sap your strength and your will to fight.
[65:24.58]And combat is inevitable, I'm afraid.
[65:28.11]or you could let me cave it.
[65:30.96]But should you best me, it will be lost to you forevermore.
[65:43.26]Hm.
[65:50.91]I just, I'm just gonna take it.
[65:55.03]Ragnar's cursed blade.
[65:59.13]I'm gonna take it.
[66:02.06]Take it.
[66:04.88]The new wielder of this item will gain a curse.
[66:10.92]Fate's toll.
[66:11.52]Lose three gold after every encounter with a dealer's mark.
[66:18.00]The relic is heavier in your hands than you expected, and its presence clouds your thoughts.
[66:24.13]The mage laughs.
[66:28.39]Your imperial masters would be most proud.
[66:33.13]Prepare to meet your fate.
[66:37.17]You struggle to lift your weapon as a group of thieves join the fray.
[66:50.98]So what does this mean?
[66:54.22]I think it looks really cool.
[66:59.46]Relic thief mage.
[67:00.34]This mage went to extraordinary lengths to gather these relics.
[67:02.84]Mages shoot projectiles from a distance.
[67:05.42]You have to evade.
[67:07.34]What?
[67:07.88]Come on, I'm confused.
[67:13.49]Don't I have it equipped?
[67:20.15]Oh shit!
[67:20.55]That shit is burning on the ground!
[67:21.83]Burning on the ground, folks!
[67:23.05]Ladies and gentlemen, burning on the ground!
[67:24.37]Whoa!
[67:25.37]Don't lose!
[67:29.76]Did not realize those things were burning on the ground still.
[67:34.18]Wow, she's fast.
[67:37.88]That happens quick.
[67:43.13]I gotta get rid of her little lackeys, man.
[67:50.03]That's it, right?
[67:52.99]Wow, she just like one...
[67:58.07]I blocked it, okay.
[67:59.21]Easy.
[68:02.53]Easy.
[68:03.75]Oh my god, how am I supposed to get over to her?
[68:07.47]She's surrounded.
[68:09.46]She has these little traps everywhere.
[68:12.04]Can I pull out a gun?
[68:13.74]Okay, here we go.
[68:14.82]Let's get in there.
[68:23.63]Oh, please.
[68:30.37]Alright, just wait till this is gone, and then go after her.
[68:39.59]Is he gonna teleport?
[68:40.89]What's happening to my body?
[68:46.55]Oh, this lady sucks.
[68:49.60]You suck.
[68:51.28]This is stupid.
[68:52.42]No, goddammit.
[68:53.60]Okay, well...
[69:03.75]Burgah Boy technique, I'm done.
[69:15.75]Dead.
[69:24.71]Yeah, sometimes you just gotta go for the Burgah Boy technique.
[69:27.37]That just has to happen.
[69:34.34]Though you failed to recover all the relics, you were able to keep them out of the hands of thieves.
[69:38.87]You journey back to the Imperial City to deliver your report.
[69:43.67]Captain Estrella meets you at the city gates.
[69:47.11]I'll take you straight to the Chief Counsel.
[69:50.01]She'll be eager to examine what you've brought back.
[69:53.29]On your walk to the palace, you explain that while you didn't manage to secure all the relics, you assure her that they are all destroyed or lost.
[70:01.37]save your excuses for the council you were sent to bring them all back the chief council takes your news like bitter medicine well I guess this is what happens when we send mercenaries and yokels to do a proper job be gone now before I question your loyalties
[70:25.07]Yay!
[70:26.23]We got the sun, the moon, and the big blue house!
[70:32.73]Empire context, the palace armory, exploring the wilds, a winding trail, and deadly forest.
[70:44.51]And we got... Gambler's Jewel!
[70:48.18]The Lord's Dyad, the Lord's Duodenum.
[70:51.30]Billy Clubs.
[70:52.42]And Mercenary Guard, we already have that.
[70:55.47]For befriending the Empire, your supply has been added to.
[70:58.51]Brigand's Blade.
[71:08.97]For making the Mad Men's Orphanage livable for orphans.
[71:13.55]The Cure.
[71:14.11]And that's that one.
[71:24.58]Mm-hmm.
[71:26.28]I'm skipping this one.
[71:27.52]This one gave me so much pain and anguish.
[71:32.91]And I was tired last night.
[71:34.41]And I'm going to say that's another reason why.
[71:36.61]But no.
[71:39.01]I'm just going to skip this one for now.
[71:40.81]We already know how this one plays out.
[71:43.09]So I want to do ones we haven't seen.
[71:44.85]So we're going to do the Lovers or the Chariot.
[71:47.35]Let's go with the Lovers.
[71:50.75]I guess I cannot take a Companion.
[71:56.97]The lovers.
[71:57.83]Keep Oswin safe from his murderous lover.
[72:02.55]Undead lackeys.
[72:03.99]Oswin's lover will send an army of skeletons to bring him back.
[72:08.41]Share food.
[72:09.12]If he is with you, Oswin will eat one food every step if he is injured.
[72:15.46]Crowd control.
[72:16.12]Dominate a fight with artifacts.
[72:17.96]Okay.
[72:20.18]I don't have, uh, I don't have Miloklips.
[72:22.28]Don't have him.
[72:23.80]Deadly Forest.
[72:24.74]This one is a super danger card.
[72:26.78]I don't think I want to do that right now.
[72:28.02]Eh, fuck it.
[72:28.92]No.
[72:29.42]I have this random companion here.
[72:31.96]A Winding Trail.
[72:33.28]Empire Contacts.
[72:35.14]Exploring the Wilds.
[72:37.20]The Palace Armory.
[72:39.52]We have to win Burning Building.
[72:41.68]And Market Thief.
[72:42.70]We have to beat these.
[72:44.06]It's just a 75% chance to lose.
[72:50.67]Get this one out here too.
[72:55.01]Fine.
[72:55.31]A couple more.
[72:58.35]We'll do fame and shame and innkeeper.
[73:03.08]Get the new items in there.
[73:04.20]Billy club.
[73:10.02]Winter's bane is always good.
[73:12.14]No.
[73:15.67]Still haven't seen this one.
[73:17.17]Mercenary garb.
[73:19.43]The Lord's Duodna.
[73:20.91]The Gambler Jewel.
[73:22.67]The Ruby Ring.
[73:23.27]Still haven't seen it.
[73:23.89]Uh, Cardinal Blade.
[73:30.52]Take the Hammer, too.
[73:36.72]Yeah, that's fine.
[73:40.66]And for supplies, we're gonna take extra food, and... You can't go wrong with just the default Soldier's Sword.
[73:47.55]You just can't.
[73:51.01]Let's give it a try.
[73:56.52]In three, two, one.
[73:59.08]Start the encounter!
[74:02.65]I gotta get a good voice for this guy.
[74:05.21]And that's how we fell in love!
[74:26.16]In retrospect, the potatoes had nothing to do with it.
[74:29.75]I merely wished to speak with their starchy beauty.
[74:33.89]Three moons ago, you came into the company of Oswin the Potato Farmer.
[74:40.83]He grabbed your arm and explained that his beloved wanted to send him to the final death so that they could be together in eternity.
[74:49.98]His desperate eyes and the promise of his family's magical sword convinced you to accompany him.
[74:56.11]Now you walk the road to his village where he claims that he will be safe from his dearest sweet potato.
[75:03.25]The farmer gnaws at a raw potato.
[75:06.27]Coinslave, could we visit my kin on the way to Nightshade Corpse?
[75:10.81]Rumor had it he's made some kind of exploding ball.
[75:14.47]He scribbles a note on your map.
[75:19.81]Fucking shit-faced John Wayne.
[75:24.36]The farmer crunches thoughtfully on a potato.
[75:29.84]Ask him if visiting his uncle is necessary.
[75:32.74]No, but he tends to get quite crabby if I don't visit while I'm in the area.
[75:38.69]What happened to his farm?
[75:40.31]Oh, my farm isn't here.
[75:41.81]It's in Nightshade Cops, where we're headed.
[75:44.97]I was merely visiting this city for the region's biannual root vegetable festival.
[75:51.15]Let's go.
[75:53.50]You wonder just how easy it will be to keep Oswin alive.
[76:01.28]Exploring Doodads.
[76:04.69]You arrive at an overturned cart propped up by a large log.
[76:08.87]Well, here we are.
[76:11.17]Oswin knocks on the top of the cart.
[76:12.63]Uncle, it's Oswin.
[76:15.96]A goblin, poorly dressed as a human, scurries out from behind the cart.
[76:20.20]You note no surprise on either Oswin nor the goblin's face.
[76:25.24]Oswin, my boy, have you come to see my exploding doodads?
[76:28.98]And before anybody can agree or protest, the goblin pulls a lit bomb from his robe and flings it into the forest.
[76:35.46]The bomb explodes spectacularly against a boulder.
[76:39.66]You there, watch out for monsters.
[76:42.40]This forest is simply ripe with them.
[76:45.41]He taps on his staff into the ground, and undead begin to crawl from a swirling portal.
[76:51.27]What?
[76:53.37]The goblin gives you a senile smile as he places a bomb in your hands.
[76:58.61]He pats Osmund on the arm, then jumps into the portal with a little whoop.
[77:05.49]Okay.
[77:09.81]Holy purification.
[77:11.63]Holy bomb.
[77:12.35]Throw a bomb that causes 80 damage to undead.
[77:16.45]focus.
[77:16.75]This artifact requires careful aim.
[77:19.51]Powerful combat item with a limited number of uses.
[77:23.08]Uses.
[77:24.26]Infinite.
[77:25.90]Okay.
[77:26.86]So, let's... Alright.
[77:30.22]The portal closes, leaving you surrounded by the walking dead, holding a bomb and with a potato farmer at your side.
[77:37.36]Kill the skeletons with the artifact to progress.
[77:43.09]Is this game worth buying?
[77:43.89]Yes.
[77:44.69]Absolutely.
[77:52.31]I would say so.
[77:53.29]There he is.
[77:53.61]There's Oswin.
[77:57.43]His love for potato is unrivaled and unyielding.
[78:00.01]Okay, right bumper is the artifact.
[78:06.82]So, right bumper.
[78:07.96]Okay, so it's like a... Alright.
[78:12.30]You actually have to aim it.
[78:15.92]Enemy type, it seems.
[78:16.86]Skeletons.
[78:17.68]Does it do damage to me?
[78:34.82]Exploding doodads.
[78:37.28]I'll take that.
[78:38.64]I'll take that.
[78:39.50]Osman's uncle appears behind you without a sound, taking the curiously enchanted bomb from your hand and replacing it with a near identical one.
[78:51.83]Oh.
[78:53.23]So it does have three uses.
[78:55.08]Alright, so he just gave me one with a small amount of uses.
[79:00.70]He then gives you both a forceful pinch on the cheek and disappears under the overturned cart.
[79:05.61]Osman seems wholly unperturbed by the happenings.
[79:10.57]You continue on your journey.
[79:13.97]Oh lord.
[79:14.13]I think it's three.
[79:14.79]I'm pretty sure it's three.
[79:44.11]But it's either three or four.
[79:47.92]Thank you, Farken, for the $1.
[79:50.16]Can I say coffee, Cheetos, chicken?
[79:51.62]I just did.
[79:52.48]Thank you.
[79:53.76]Coolcat, thanks for the $1.
[79:54.58]Hey, Jimmer, can you shout out my sister?
[79:56.30]It's her birthday.
[79:57.02]Her name is A. Hashtag A. Oh, well.
[80:01.65]Happy birthday, hashtag A. I see what you're doing there, but it's not going to work.
[80:07.69]It's not going to work.
[80:08.21]Everyone's way too intelligent for that.
[80:11.39]Thank you.
[80:12.35]Thank you, Clink, again.
[80:15.06]Uh, I didn't read your message there.
[80:16.64]Thank you, Clink, for the $1.
[80:17.36]Hey, Jeremiah, having trouble getting this midterm paper written.
[80:21.27]Can you give me a kick in the rear to help me be motivated?
[80:25.25]Uh, yeah.
[80:26.85]It's called... Just write, depending on how long it is, set small goals for the paper over the next, like, six hours.
[80:38.06]Right?
[80:39.20]So what you want to do is you want to write like, let's say the paper is like three pages long.
[80:44.68]Or like four pages long.
[80:47.04]Write half of one page.
[80:49.72]Go get a snack, take a break.
[80:51.88]You know?
[80:52.88]Blow your nose.
[80:54.46]Hang up for like a little bit.
[80:55.94]20, 15, 20 minutes.
[80:57.83]Write the second half of page one.
[81:01.03]Do that for the next like 70 to 30 hours.
[81:02.89]70 to 100 hours.
[81:05.91]No.
[81:07.45]Take frequent breaks.
[81:09.51]And just try to write it one bit at a time.
[81:12.83]If you try to write a paper in one sitting, you're going to pull your hair out.
[81:17.69]I've done it a thousand times.
[81:19.20]It's not cool.
[81:23.04]That's the best way to write a paper, in my opinion.
[81:26.62]Write one minute, one hour break.
[81:30.22]You could say that.
[81:31.70]But thank you.
[81:32.24]Thank you also, StixRenegade.
[81:33.42]Thank you, Stix!
[81:36.45]Thank you.
[81:40.93]And I think that is all caught up.
[81:42.89]Well, right now, Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[81:45.92]Hey, Jeremy.
[81:47.70]Notices my facecam.
[81:48.92]What's this?
[81:49.70]With that, like, bulge face.
[81:53.66]Thank you Alright, so we got uh everyone is painfully painfully, but it's okay We're gonna ask the audience and you guys were wrong.
[82:02.14]I was gonna pick three you heard me say it I should I you guys have only been right one time can we be very very clear at this?
[82:09.27]The ask the audience has only been correct once I Would have been correct at least three out of four of these times.
[82:15.99]I was gonna pick three I
[82:21.93]In the hubbub, somebody loops a bag over your head, tying it tight.
[82:25.96]You struggle for a while before passing out.
[82:30.34]When you come to, Osman and his skeletal kidnappers are gone.
[82:34.34]Osman is in trouble.
[82:46.07]Chat is always right, because Osman's time is limited.
[82:52.21]Does this go down in real time, or does it go down per card?
[82:58.26]Per card, okay.
[82:59.04]General store.
[83:00.80]I don't really have much.
[83:02.78]Can I buy anything here?
[83:04.58]No.
[83:04.88]What do I got for equipment, though?
[83:08.42]Let's just sell this immediately.
[83:09.88]Alright, so hold on.
[83:12.84]I gotta use this against northerners.
[83:13.80]No.
[83:13.88]No.
[83:20.11]No, I guess I could buy food.
[83:22.21]Wait, what are you guys going to give me here?
[83:25.69]You guys are already giving me food.
[83:29.65]What is A here?
[83:31.71]What is that?
[83:32.97]Why is that the Angry Sun from Mario 3?
[83:34.91]I don't know what that means.
[83:39.56]Let's buy 3 food.
[83:45.70]That works.
[83:49.33]Alright, let's get Oz.
[83:50.11]Let's get Oswald.
[83:51.25]Terrible things stand between you and your quest.
[83:55.98]Following tracks and hearsay, you find Oswin hanging from a ledge far above a gaping ravine.
[84:01.36]Oh, thank the gods!
[84:05.28]Quick!
[84:06.12]No, this has got to be way more intense.
[84:08.90]Oh, thank the gods!
[84:10.38]Quick, help me up before they return!
[84:12.02]They think I'm dead!
[84:20.89]The Lord giveth and hashtag B takes it away.
[84:30.25]Always one?
[84:31.15]No, don't always vote for one.
[84:35.73]No, those of you guys that are always saying one, you're the guy that goes to the casino and puts... You're the guy at the casino with the roulette table that takes...
[84:45.62]five dollars and puts it on the same two or three numbers every spin and then holds his hands in the air with his fingers crossed going like that guy loses every time that guy never wins
[85:14.96]I didn't even... I was gonna try to, like, prove a point there.
[85:18.84]Oh, well.
[85:20.52]Oh, no.
[85:20.82]That was our failsafe there.
[85:22.03]It's one.
[85:42.81]Always vote for one, right?
[85:44.65]It's one.
[85:45.31]It's definitely one.
[85:49.99]And we are at a very... We are at a complete consensus.
[85:52.75]Almost 50... More than 60% of the people also think so.
[85:59.56]This is a true ask the audience.
[86:07.54]We're gonna kill this guy.
[86:09.60]As you struggle to keep him aloft, a potato falls from his haversack.
[86:13.16]He twists in concern and you lose your grip.
[86:16.02]You catch onto Osman's haversack, tearing it open.
[86:19.02]Potatoes pour out and Osman cries a cry of despair.
[86:26.97]It's three.
[86:34.77]It's not one!
[86:36.49]Stop pointing for one.
[86:38.35]It's probably- It's three.
[86:41.43]It's not one.
[86:43.31]I'm almost- I'm almost certain it's not one.
[86:45.75]It's three.
[86:50.51]Oh my god, he's dead!
[86:54.82]Your heart jumps to your throat as Oswin slips from your grip and drops into the ravine.
[86:59.90]You dragged poor Oswin out of the river.
[87:07.30]Oswin pokes a pile of bones.
[87:20.90]He looks quite pleased for a moment before remembering that the skeletons were trying to kill him.
[87:27.20]He's in pretty high spirits for literally being dropped off a cliff.
[87:31.12]You keep a close eye on the potato farmer.
[87:32.85]Surely you think he won't get kidnapped again.
[87:36.09]You gain four famine.
[87:36.89]You can heal Oswin at the campfire.
[87:41.35]We're going to go ahead and do that right now.
[87:46.45]The road to Nightshade Cop's wins through forest and small towns.
[87:51.07]A small peasant family journeying to the capital joins your campfire.
[87:56.64]She has the most beautiful face, you know.
[87:59.10]And in the evening, we talk about potatoes until the sun came up.
[88:10.28]Just the thought of it makes me silly.
[88:15.72]Let's get him to- I got nine food.
[88:17.98]Hey, vote for- get me some food.
[88:20.12]We're gonna heal him back up.
[88:21.40]That was your fault, chat.
[88:23.24]You guys did all the fucked up voting and now like you have to make up for it by voting for C. I'm not keeping him at that health.
[88:32.16]I'm not gonna give you guys that opportunity.
[88:35.22]Alright, that's good.
[88:35.82]Let's break camp.
[88:43.04]Empire contacts.
[88:45.45]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[89:01.18]Hold on.
[89:02.96]Hold on.
[89:03.30]My mother just texted me.
[89:05.04]Let me see what she said.
[89:07.97]Let me see what Ma said.
[89:10.17]Hello, Ma.
[89:18.27]We're good.
[89:21.69]Okay.
[89:24.28]Don't I want to know what A does?
[89:25.44]Not really, because what if it does something bad?
[89:28.50]Okay, you visit your contact in the Imperial Armory.
[89:33.60]You must be planning for trouble if you're coming to me for help.
[89:37.44]Tell me, who are you hunting?
[89:39.36]I'll see what I can find in the vault of contraband items.
[89:44.97]Corrupted or undead, right?
[89:49.93]I mean, we're not fighting thieves.
[89:52.39]Thieves, undead, it's undead.
[89:54.05]But I guess they're not even here.
[90:00.30]I'm going to go with corrupted because the closest thing is the undead.
[90:08.81]I don't think undead are corrupted, but we're definitely not fighting these guys.
[90:16.37]You outline your plans to hunt corrupted.
[90:19.65]Something came in just yesterday.
[90:21.13]Hmm.
[90:22.99]Give me one sec.
[90:25.69]Well, there it is.
[90:26.19]The Lord's Dewanda.
[90:29.33]I could get in a lot of trouble if anyone finds out I took it from the vault.
[90:33.15]I'll have it sent to you when I can.
[90:34.45]Okay.
[90:39.70]I get it later?
[90:43.02]These cards will put it... Oh, okay.
[90:44.94]Just adds it to the deck.
[90:47.46]So it just goes at the top of the equipment deck.
[90:48.92]That's cool.
[90:50.95]You leave the armory.
[90:51.91]That's cool.
[90:54.22]Okay, here we go.
[90:56.57]Here we go.
[90:57.97]Guys, we're running into the burning building.
[91:01.67]We have to do this.
[91:03.65]Let Oswin attempt the rescue.
[91:06.73]Hey, Oswin, get in there and go save those kids.
[91:12.48]No, brave the fire myself.
[91:14.96]I can't even use your guys' help.
[91:17.54]I have to win.
[91:19.04]I'm not going to do it.
[91:23.47]It's not going to happen.
[91:26.05]I need to get extraordinarily lucky.
[91:27.89]Go in again.
[91:28.57]Go back into the burning building.
[91:32.53]It's going to spin faster.
[91:33.83]And here we go.
[91:34.59]Alright.
[91:38.07]Here it comes.
[91:38.99]I have one opportunity and it spins really fast.
[91:41.21]And I have to stop it so early.
[91:46.24]Yeah.
[91:47.14]Please go find my husband.
[91:48.66]Third time's the charm.
[91:50.24]Strike three, you're out.
[91:51.10]This is it.
[91:51.78]Aye yi yi.
[91:55.54]Oh my god, fucking god damn it.
[91:57.62]That's so... That's such a... God.
[92:11.31]I keep killing this lady's husbands.
[92:15.00]Maybe this is the world telling you, lady, to stop getting remarried.
[92:22.06]Your husbands keep dying in fires.
[92:29.11]Whatever.
[92:30.55]Oh shit, he's eating the food.
[92:32.01]Hey!
[92:33.24]Get me that food!
[92:34.82]I need it now.
[92:36.74]He's eating too much.
[92:39.42]He's eating too many foods.
[92:44.83]You arrive at a village during their market fair.
[92:47.31]Enter the fair.
[92:51.17]Vegetables spill from baskets and the air has a cozy smell of fresh baked bread and butter.
[92:56.79]Osman immediately wanders off.
[92:59.38]No, no, no, no.
[93:00.32]He's gonna get kidnapped again by skeletons.
[93:03.44]But we're gonna play the strength game.
[93:04.72]Who cares?
[93:05.98]God damn it.
[93:08.72]Behind a counter sits a small boy fussing over a puppy.
[93:12.28]He holds out a heavy wooden mallet.
[93:14.55]Ten gold to play.
[93:15.83]If you win, you can draw from the prize hat.
[93:19.50]I don't have any money.
[93:20.08]I don't have any money, so just go find him.
[93:24.42]You spot Oswin trading a fistful of gold for a meager sack of vegetables.
[93:29.04]The stall owners are very clearly bandits.
[93:31.42]They chuckle and count the coins not believing their luck.
[93:35.72]Oswin tries to jam a potato in a sack already full to bursting.
[93:39.96]He looks up and gives you a little wave.
[93:43.50]You worry about the road ahead.
[93:48.38]I feel like if you do one of those... You awaken one morning to find Oswin completely vanished.
[93:54.84]He's gone.
[93:55.54]I don't have any food.
[93:57.44]Alright, I'm taking this step and I want three food.
[94:02.58]Alright, go ahead.
[94:03.40]Give me food.
[94:04.48]His time is limited.
[94:05.27]He takes ten damage.
[94:07.79]I'm going to get this food right now.
[94:10.01]Look at that.
[94:11.55]Beautiful.
[94:13.53]Beautiful.
[94:14.67]Alright.
[94:16.53]The palace armory is holding a special promotion for the nobility.
[94:21.27]The guards bow to you as you enter.
[94:24.67]Welcome.
[94:25.87]You'll be pleased with what we have in store for you today.
[94:29.73]I don't have any money, so... The store man presents you with a truck filled with equipment.
[94:34.75]A fee of 10 gold will allow you to enter the promotion.
[94:36.95]I need money.
[94:39.34]It's a goddamn scam.
[94:43.60]Friendly innkeeper.
[94:44.38]I don't have any fucking money.
[94:46.48]What about the rumors?
[94:49.67]You ask whether any interesting guests have stayed at the inn.
[94:52.25]The innkeeper lets you look through the lost property box to see if anything useful has been left behind.
[94:57.05]Oh, baby.
[94:59.46]Oh, baby.
[95:00.38]It's just medium armor.
[95:04.92]What do I have for a weapon now?
[95:08.40]I'm going to take the armor.
[95:18.33]Uh, leave.
[95:22.33]Alright.
[95:22.95]Exploding doodads.
[95:24.27]You run to Osman's goblin uncle.
[95:25.85]He beckons you over to a tree stump.
[95:28.53]As you approach, he places two items side by side on the stump.
[95:34.73]One will make your enemies your friends.
[95:36.28]The other is poison.
[95:37.80]Which shall you drink?
[95:38.58]Quickly, quickly.
[95:39.32]Choose, choose.
[95:39.74]There's a bomb in a bottle marked poison.
[95:45.39]One will make your enemies your friends.
[95:46.49]The other is poison.
[95:47.81]Which are you going to drink?
[95:54.36]This is the old switcheroo.
[95:55.74]I'm going to pick in the bottle.
[95:59.36]This is a trick.
[96:00.92]I'm going to drink the bottle of poison.
[96:03.14]Because there's no way that this is real.
[96:07.34]Pick up the bottle.
[96:09.71]The goblin nods gleefully as you unstopper the bottle and drink the thick liquid.
[96:14.42]It tastes of butter loaf and sweet berries.
[96:16.60]You don't feel any different.
[96:18.70]Just as you go to laugh of the absurdity of it all, the goblin smacks hard on your hand with his staff, breaking your finger.
[96:32.87]Satisfied with the proceedings, the old goblin gives you a little wave and climbs up a nearby tree.
[96:38.11]The bomb still lies on the stump.
[96:40.53]You pocket it and look up to see skeletons emerging from the thicket.
[96:45.87]Poison.
[96:49.27]Okay, hold on.
[96:52.43]Throw a bomb that causes enemies to fight on your side for 10 seconds.
[96:56.55]Does not affect elite enemies.
[97:02.85]I wonder which is more useful.
[97:05.67]This one seems more useful.
[97:08.05]Because it's not just for undead.
[97:11.47]So...
[97:13.44]The Holy Bomb is cool, but it only works on one enemy type.
[97:16.96]This will work on anybody.
[97:19.54]It only has three uses, though.
[97:24.64]Yeah, I'm going to keep this one.
[97:28.03]Well, I'm going to have to test it.
[97:29.51]No, I'm not going to use it.
[97:34.25]But these are skeletons.
[97:35.73]True, but who's to say that this is probably not going to be the only enemy type in this whole deck, this whole encounter, the whole mission.
[97:47.24]Returned.
[97:48.04]Raised from endless sleep to fight once more.
[97:50.04]Skeletons are weak, but come armed with an assortment of equipment, making preparations for combat challenging.
[97:55.27]Vulnerable to holy.
[97:58.37]So, here we go.
[98:03.09]It's just... What are they doing?
[98:06.97]Guys!
[98:08.89]Can somebody fight someone, please?
[98:10.69]Fight each other!
[98:12.82]No!
[98:13.30]What?
[98:14.54]Why were they not fighting each other?
[98:15.80]And why couldn't I hurt them?
[98:21.87]Okay, that was kind of lame.
[98:30.23]Thankfully, they're really weak.
[98:36.04]Oh, I turned... Okay, so I turned them all.
[98:40.64]Why couldn't I...
[98:47.46]All I did was make them all friends.
[98:50.02]And that was it.
[98:55.41]I have... Okay, well, so... At least give me some credit here.
[98:58.27]I did just bowl a strike.
[99:01.39]I shouldn't have bowled a strike, is what you're saying.
[99:04.29]Okay, well, whatever.
[99:08.25]You continue your journey wondering how you'll next encounter Oswin's goblin uncle.
[99:13.47]I'm out of food.
[99:14.19]Uh-oh.
[99:19.14]This is not good.
[99:22.04]I need food.
[99:27.66]This is not... It's all negatives up there on the top right.
[99:30.15]God damn it.
[99:32.55]You find Oswin surrounded by bandits, swinging his pitchfork wildly and threatening to use their tailbones to kill the farm.
[99:41.51]Light weapons are recommended against... See, thieves!
[99:43.31]Here, so it's not just undead.
[99:46.18]That's all I have, so... Let's go.
[99:53.91]If I need to throw the friend grenade, I will.
[100:02.05]Oh, fuck.
[100:02.43]Watch out, dude.
[100:02.95]This guy's got a friend grenade.
[100:08.24]It's an ordinary sword.
[100:11.42]He's already at, like, half health.
[100:32.38]Still one of those guys back there?
[100:36.00]I tried to block that and it didn't work.
[100:45.88]Aye, aye, aye.
[100:59.84]right to the stomach why do all the songs he does become 90s boy band songs what are you talking about what are you talking about you search the bodies for anything you've used food I don't need that I want food 10 food unbelievable
[101:21.54]You keep a close eye on the potato farmer, surely you think he won't get kidnapped again.
[101:26.41]But, uh, let's heal him.
[101:30.85]Heal Oswald.
[101:31.69]Why do I keep calling him Oswald?
[101:33.43]Let's get him to, like, 70-something.
[101:38.52]No, 68's fine.
[101:40.72]No.
[101:42.14]Look, I'm gonna look back at this and I'm gonna be like, I'm glad I gave him that last one.
[101:46.53]No trades.
[101:47.67]Break him.
[101:55.12]Fame and shame.
[101:55.88]I don't even have any money.
[101:56.96]I picked all these things that need money.
[102:01.08]Did we get kidnapped again?
[102:02.88]We just woke up from the last camp.
[102:06.68]You wake one night to the sound of... So what?
[102:08.70]I just stood up.
[102:10.13]I saved him.
[102:11.81]We left the campfire and somebody grabbed him from behind with two hands and covered his mouth and dragged him into the woods again.
[102:17.43]Okay.
[102:18.07]Okay.
[102:20.29]Yet more skeletons are attempting to kidnap him.
[102:22.77]Okay.
[102:23.53]Let's just get out of this.
[102:26.71]It's one or two.
[102:31.54]It's always one.
[102:33.80]Always vote one.
[102:40.74]Although a lot of you guys think it's three.
[102:44.42]This is pretty split here.
[102:49.29]I don't know.
[102:49.93]I thought it was one.
[102:55.20]I was gonna say one, really.
[103:13.25]Oh, the fucking way down there.
[103:16.43]Chat was right?
[103:17.33]No.
[103:18.29]Hold on.
[103:19.33]A majority of chat was not right.
[103:22.70]A bunch of chat was correct, but a majority of chat was wrong.
[103:27.86]As well as me.
[103:29.38]It's never one.
[103:30.26]Why do I keep picking one?
[103:33.42]One, two, three.
[103:34.86]One, two.
[103:35.26]Doesn't matter.
[103:35.72]He's gonna take... A bunch of... A horde of skulls.
[103:40.43]Great.
[103:47.95]Number one is a meme.
[103:48.87]Don't pick it ever.
[103:49.85]Okay.
[103:50.91]Actually, that's good to know.
[103:54.86]I haven't voted once, so I'm always right.
[103:58.64]That's true.
[104:00.00]Hey, Animos!
[104:00.92]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[104:02.14]Hey, Dermot, thank you for giving me laughter through the years.
[104:03.92]Wish you much happiness and success.
[104:09.11]Okay, hold on.
[104:10.41]Wish you much happiness and success with the owl face.
[104:15.47]Well, thank you, Animos.
[104:17.70]Annie Moos for the 10 bucks.
[104:19.84]Appreciate it.
[104:22.09]Gaming Trickster, thanks for the $1.
[104:23.27]Jerma, you didn't read my bits with proper pronunciation.
[104:25.67]Please go back and read it again.
[104:26.95]This time with all the W's.
[104:29.29]O-W-O.
[104:34.17]I still don't understand this.
[104:40.16]That's an owl face or like a guy's... That person has two penises.
[104:47.73]I don't understand.
[104:48.65]Okay, so that's funny.
[104:49.45]It's like two balls and that guy has like two dicks.
[104:54.18]Is that why it's funny?
[104:55.26]Is that the joke?
[104:59.98]I mean, whatever.
[105:03.76]That's very, very disproportionate balls to penis, by the way.
[105:06.59]Double penis.
[105:08.19]Why am I talking about this?
[105:09.41]What is this?
[105:09.95]We're done.
[105:15.89]Thank you also to Vape Game Bill Clinton for the $5.
[105:20.62]Loving the stream tonight, Jerma.
[105:23.60]Thanks, man.
[105:24.02]Appreciate it.
[105:24.54]There we go.
[105:32.73]Laugh at the funny joke.
[105:33.75]Uh-huh.
[105:37.13]I don't know what the hell it is.
[105:38.55]You guys think I'm some kind of meme knower machine.
[105:43.89]I'm old.
[105:45.23]Remember.
[105:45.53]Oh god, they're going to keep... You know what?
[105:53.78]I got three people.
[105:55.26]Whatever.
[105:56.04]This was going to get real bad real quickly.
[106:09.22]He's like almost dead.
[106:11.43]Back up, back up, back up.
[106:15.51]No, just back up dude, you're gonna die.
[106:19.05]Mistake, it's a mistake if you don't... This dude is gonna die, like legit dead.
[106:29.60]Of course the one guy that's... I had to use it, I had to.
[106:38.02]No!
[106:38.40]Stay away from him!
[106:41.46]Oh, goddammit.
[106:42.24]Stop reviving.
[106:47.58]Am I being throttled?
[106:49.62]Uh, what do you mean?
[106:57.26]You rummage through the bones to find anything useful.
[106:59.02]Food.
[107:01.18]One equipment.
[107:04.10]Okay, did... Oh, there it is.
[107:06.89]What does this do?
[107:10.01]Defeat a corrupted enemy to cause a short stun to all nearby enemies.
[107:14.62]Reduces the swing of the precision gambits of the metronome.
[107:19.64]Or... No, I'm with the sword.
[107:21.92]Yeah.
[107:23.54]We just need to take this.
[107:25.05]This is much better.
[107:29.49]Nothing else.
[107:30.39]Free food.
[107:31.23]Come on, give me another card.
[107:33.31]Osmund brushes himself off seemingly undisturbed by the repeat kidnappings.
[107:37.70]Persistent, aren't they?
[107:40.38]Okay, we have to heal him.
[107:41.34]He's got 22 health.
[107:48.68]Heal Oswin.
[107:50.93]Do it like another... That's good.
[107:56.11]Yeah, okay.
[107:56.91]37, that's terrible, but... Can I buy?
[108:00.09]I don't have anything to sell equipment.
[108:03.55]Why only two?
[108:09.83]Sell this.
[108:10.35]I don't have any more of these left.
[108:26.07]Just get rid of this.
[108:26.71]There's nothing in here.
[108:29.65]Equip this.
[108:31.27]I'll be able to buy one food.
[108:35.54]Yes.
[108:35.74]Yes.
[108:39.27]Oh, man.
[108:39.81]Buy food.
[108:40.33]I can buy one.
[108:44.61]Alright, let's heal him.
[108:46.57]You get to eat one more time, dude.
[108:53.70]Okay.
[108:53.98]42 health.
[108:55.62]Break camp.
[108:57.50]Let's go.
[108:57.86]Okay, lost three.
[109:01.09]Oh, I lost three food.
[109:02.71]You guys just... Okay, now... Well, the run's over.
[109:07.31]Okay, great.
[109:08.03]That's good.
[109:09.51]Minus three food after all that.
[109:11.93]Now it's not completable.
[109:18.27]Can you claim this token?
[109:21.62]Twitch chat integration.
[109:24.20]Once every 30 minutes, the run ends.
[109:28.93]Okay, get this right for me.
[109:30.47]Get this right.
[109:31.01]I want everybody to pay attention.
[109:32.21]If you're watching right now in a different tab, hey, get the fuck off Reddit for a second.
[109:35.51]Get over here.
[109:36.27]Everybody.
[109:36.83]All 2100 of you.
[109:38.47]Everybody.
[109:40.03]Stop watching something else.
[109:41.65]Get away.
[109:42.25]You're watching probably like one or two streams right now.
[109:44.34]Get over here.
[109:46.08]Can you hear me?
[109:47.94]You writing that paper?
[109:49.30]Where's that guy that's writing the paper?
[109:50.92]Get over here.
[109:52.22]Get this right because we're going to lose.
[109:53.96]Here we go.
[109:54.44]Pay attention.
[109:55.46]Focus.
[109:59.19]What?
[110:02.45]What happened?
[110:03.57]What the fuck?
[110:03.95]What happened?
[110:04.45]What?
[110:05.63]I just made everybody pay attention for no reason.
[110:07.25]What?
[110:07.43]I don't have any money.
[110:09.10]Oh my fucking god.
[110:18.66]There's nothing.
[110:20.52]I don't have anything to steal.
[110:22.72]Oh, this is over.
[110:23.94]Give me the five food.
[110:25.38]Give it to me.
[110:27.60]We've been on this mission for like 40 minutes.
[110:30.12]You want it just to end right now?
[110:32.88]Yeah.
[110:34.62]Enter the inn.
[110:37.54]Oh, goddammit.
[110:40.36]Osmund disappears briefly and returns with a potato pasty.
[110:43.45]You watch him take a bite with gusto.
[110:46.77]Oi!
[110:48.01]A growl echoes from across the inn.
[110:49.63]A hulking northerner grabs your companion by the arm.
[110:53.33]That was my pasty, little man!
[110:58.75]The potato farmer looks up at his furious assailant, then down to the crisp, warm pastry.
[111:04.34]To your exasperation, he appears to be considering eating it anyways.
[111:07.58]Alright, we're gonna try to... We're gonna do diplomacy here.
[111:12.06]Because I need food.
[111:13.60]And maybe I can end up eating it.
[111:16.36]Calm down.
[111:19.97]I had enough.
[111:20.67]Wait.
[111:20.85]Oh my fuck!
[111:21.29]I fucking panicked!
[111:22.09]Oh!
[111:32.04]I panicked.
[111:34.40]I was waiting for like the other boards to come and I panicked.
[111:38.23]Don't ever panic.
[111:39.89]You draw your weapon and the northerners respond in kind.
[111:41.99]As they rush towards you, you see Oswin hastily shove the rest of the pastry into his mouth.
[111:47.65]Fuck.
[111:48.21]It's over here.
[111:50.81]Maybe I can loot their bodies.
[111:52.05]This might not be a total loss.
[111:58.06]This might not be a complete and total loss.
[112:00.61]Oh, this is so... He's dead.
[112:01.93]This is over.
[112:02.33]This is over here.
[112:07.50]Look good.
[112:07.84]They're watching one by one.
[112:08.92]Keep it that way.
[112:17.20]Keep it that way.
[112:18.67]We are in a bar, so that makes sense.
[112:30.37]Don't go for him!
[112:31.53]Don't go for him!
[112:32.57]Wow, that was a great, great move.
[112:35.25]See, he didn't panic.
[112:36.17]I did.
[112:40.91]Oh, don't kill him!
[112:46.15]He's doing a great job.
[112:50.56]Oh, shit!
[112:51.72]No!
[112:54.16]Run away, dude!
[112:55.54]Run the other direction!
[112:56.46]Run the other direction!
[112:58.32]Ooh!
[113:02.73]Don't you dare!
[113:12.26]Please let me loot their bodies for food.
[113:14.08]At least let me get that.
[113:18.20]The remaining northerners limp away, muttering threats as they go.
[113:21.83]The inn's patrons back away nervously as you return to your seat.
[113:25.83]You rest a while before continuing your journey.
[113:32.76]I need to... I have to sell... I have to sell things.
[113:36.61]I have to.
[113:38.99]Sell equipment.
[113:40.95]I have to get rid of, like, the sword.
[113:42.75]I gotta... Everything must go.
[113:49.42]Everything must go.
[113:52.04]At least... Like, this.
[113:54.70]No, I have to keep that.
[113:55.66]Fuck, the blade...
[114:02.49]The armor, the blade.
[114:04.63]Sell the bombs.
[114:05.33]No, there's going to be a final encounter with undead.
[114:07.79]It's going to be the queen undead.
[114:14.20]Keep the sword.
[114:20.60]Sell the bomb.
[114:26.91]Getting rid of the armor.
[114:31.89]Walk around three times for food?
[114:35.08]I can't... Look, I can't... There's nowhere I can go.
[114:37.94]If I walk forward right now, I'm gonna take a bunch of dan... I'm gonna die.
[114:42.38]I can't.
[114:45.42]Buy food.
[114:46.30]What can I do?
[114:46.76]I can buy one.
[114:47.66]No, I can't.
[114:48.13]Can't buy anything.
[114:55.59]Had to be done.
[114:56.57]Unfortunately.
[115:01.55]It had to be done.
[115:05.14]Sad, but it had to be done.
[115:08.60]Alright, let's go.
[115:10.22]I want to heal him, but I... God damn it!
[115:17.42]Okay, here comes the uncle again.
[115:22.83]What?
[115:22.99]That wasn't what I was supposed to do.
[115:24.33]To B, we go.
[115:27.77]No, don't go to B. Stay on A.
[115:30.72]If you go to B, then we have to start over.
[115:34.56]And you don't want that.
[115:35.84]You want to see the rest of the encounters and shit.
[115:38.94]You don't want that to happen.
[115:40.08]Don't vote for B. A vote for B is a vote for the devil.
[115:44.89]You run into Oswin's goblin uncle.
[115:47.05]And I say that and it goes up by like 3%.
[115:49.25]You fucking assholes.
[115:50.87]Look at the amount of dickies in this chat right now.
[115:54.15]Look at these dickies voting for B while I talk.
[115:56.39]And slowly it's coming back to where it should be.
[116:00.68]Really, what was it at?
[116:01.50]17%?
[116:01.84]18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25?
[116:04.82]You're telling me there's 8% Dickie in my chat here?
[116:14.23]9%?
[116:14.35]10%!
[116:14.37]Getting close to 10% Dickies in my chat.
[116:17.09]Welcome back to the game of life and death.
[116:21.09]Good to know.
[116:22.11]I'm glad to know that 10% of you guys are Dickies.
[116:25.87]That's fine.
[116:30.76]The goblin reaches out a wrinkled hand.
[116:32.96]An artifact, if you will.
[116:35.23]Give him one of your artifacts.
[116:36.27]I don't have anything.
[116:38.95]You don't have any artifacts.
[116:39.91]The wrinkled goblin nods his head.
[116:41.75]Such is life.
[116:44.75]Oh, he's dead.
[116:47.11]Please put him right next to me.
[116:48.19]He got kidnapped.
[116:48.96]Thank God he's right next to me.
[116:50.68]Oh my God, that's so lucky.
[116:52.56]That's the luckiest fucking thing that could have happened.
[116:57.19]If he was even one other space to the right, it's game over.
[117:03.97]Get him.
[117:07.19]You find Osman on the road, shoved along by the northerners from the dainty fox.
[117:17.64]As you near, you overhear him expounding his passion for potatoes to his captors.
[117:24.43]Alright, one shouts at him to be silent, another draws a weapon.
[117:27.09]Try to defuse the situation.
[117:30.37]You rush forward with your weapon sheathed.
[117:33.44]Alright, guys.
[117:41.56]This makes or breaks the whole run.
[117:44.72]So we gotta get it right.
[117:46.34]I honestly do think it is one.
[117:53.81]Shit.
[117:55.13]It's one or three.
[117:59.71]Alright, those of you guys that voted for three, how confident are you that one is also a success?
[118:16.94]Not at all.
[118:19.45]I do watch the cards.
[118:26.29]There it is.
[118:27.47]Bingo.
[118:30.02]Your joke about the owl and the hay bale results in raucous laughter.
[118:34.10]The northerners let Oswin go free.
[118:39.62]You keep a close eye on the potato farmer.
[118:41.04]Surely you think he won't get kidnapped again.
[118:44.12]Alright, we get to take a step here and we get that plus five health.
[118:49.02]Thank you.
[118:50.16]Thank you, guys.
[118:51.14]Thank you.
[118:52.52]Five food is going to go a long way.
[118:54.18]Now we're at the general store.
[118:56.94]Is there anything else I can sell?
[119:01.96]I think I have to.
[119:05.06]I have to.
[119:05.62]You're going to take it away immediately?
[119:09.03]I think I have to sell the sword.
[119:10.25]I think I do.
[119:11.17]Honest to God, I'm going to have to use my gamer skills to beat enemies now.
[119:15.03]Because we're eating too much food together.
[119:22.25]So that will get me four more food.
[119:35.03]I'll camp if necessary.
[119:38.98]Oh no, we ain't doing this.
[119:40.36]Not now.
[119:40.84]We're not doing the extraordinarily...
[119:51.87]Crazy difficult mission right now.
[119:56.06]Sorry.
[119:59.12]No, I'm not going to do it.
[119:59.94]We're going to lose.
[120:03.06]No, I'm not doing it.
[120:03.84]Leave.
[120:04.02]I ain't doing it.
[120:06.16]That's for another time.
[120:07.00]Okay.
[120:13.01]It's five food if you don't.
