[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.41]What's up?
[00:03.63]How's everybody doing?
[00:06.03]Welcome back.
[00:07.33]Hello.
[00:14.47]Hey!
[00:17.22]So today, on today's stream... Alright, you know when you're at a game's title screen?
[00:25.66]And here, I'll just show you.
[00:27.28]When you're at a game's title screen, and usually you got...
[00:31.20]Usually you get, like, a minute before it goes to, like, the automatic cutscene demo thing.
[00:35.96]That's not happening here.
[00:37.62]It keeps cutting me off.
[00:39.08]And it keeps fucking with my... It keeps fucking with my head.
[00:41.17]Alright, so I'm gonna go here to make it so it doesn't do that.
[00:43.69]There we go.
[00:44.65]Anyways, we're still... Hold on.
[00:49.11]This isn't Dead Rising.
[00:50.37]Is that what the title is?
[00:51.35]I didn't put... No, okay.
[00:54.96]I thought... For a second, I thought the category was Dead Rising.
[00:58.22]I was like, how did I fuck that up?
[01:01.97]We're gonna play Beautiful Joe.
[01:03.05]I've been trying to play this game for like two months.
[01:06.85]And just was like, you know what?
[01:07.71]I feel like playing it today.
[01:09.89]We'll probably play today and tomorrow.
[01:11.49]I'll probably beat this fucking game.
[01:13.27]You know what I mean?
[01:16.21]I'm probably gonna play President Evil.
[01:19.93]I'm probably gonna play Resident Evil 3 next week.
[01:23.72]That's the plan.
[01:25.00]Is to just do that first thing we do next week.
[01:30.24]I probably can get that done in one stream.
[01:35.19]But something else that we're going to try to do this week.
[01:38.23]We talked about it two days ago.
[01:40.75]And I want to give it a try.
[01:41.65]We're going to watch a movie.
[01:47.81]On Friday, probably.
[01:50.73]On Friday, we're going to do a watch party stream.
[01:55.35]It's going to be a piece of shit.
[01:57.39]I'm going to be very honest with you.
[01:58.93]I've got to be up front with you.
[02:00.57]It's going to be a shitty experience, probably.
[02:04.17]But I'm going to do it.
[02:06.86]I'm gonna stream on Friday.
[02:08.16]We're gonna just do like a just chatting stream for like an hour or so.
[02:13.22]And then we're gonna use that time to pick the movie we're going to watch.
[02:18.08]And then we're gonna do it.
[02:20.70]That's the plan on Friday.
[02:23.42]I don't think we can do A Bug's Life.
[02:27.84]I'm not sure that's available.
[02:35.49]Where are we gonna watch it?
[02:36.47]I think we can just do it here.
[02:40.64]Can't we just do it here?
[02:43.92]That's like the point is we all watch the movie together.
[02:52.34]Is it gonna be TOS?
[02:53.16]No, it's actually, it is terms of service.
[02:56.80]It's part of the terms of service.
[02:59.18]You can watch a movie on Twitch.
[03:01.24]As long as you use their feature.
[03:03.70]And I mean, nobody uses this feature.
[03:05.66]We'll give them some good feedback.
[03:07.62]We'll be like, oh, hey, this thing sucks.
[03:09.83]Or, hey, this thing sucks, but here's some other things you could add to it.
[03:13.01]Alright?
[03:17.63]I'm gonna do some more research on it over the next day or two.
[03:19.75]Let's watch Ratatouille.
[03:25.60]I gotta see what's available.
[03:26.88]We'll pick a good one.
[03:29.93]People have to pay to watch.
[03:32.83]You do?
[03:38.89]It's Prime only.
[03:40.73]Oh.
[03:43.43]Well... I... We're still gonna try it.
[03:48.69]I wanna try it.
[03:50.71]I wanna give it a try.
[03:51.53]It's US only?
[03:54.65]Why is it US only?
[03:58.46]It's Prime only and US only.
[04:00.44]I'm actually going to tell you, it's Nevada only.
[04:05.84]I wonder if I can set that up.
[04:10.23]I still want to try it though.
[04:14.15]He hates EU.
[04:15.21]You guys in EU are going to be looking through the window.
[04:18.41]Like, there's a party going on in there!
[04:21.67]No, actually no, you won't be doing that.
[04:23.79]There'll be blackout shades on the windows.
[04:28.10]You'll just know that there's a party going on inside.
[04:30.53]I'm sorry.
[04:33.25]Yeah, you'll have, like, big earmuffs on, so you can't hear anything, and, like, just, uh, there'll be shades on the window, so you're gonna be... That's kind of sad.
[04:41.13]I'm sorry.
[04:47.30]Don't blame me!
[04:48.36]Blame... It's a Twitch thing!
[04:52.40]They're the ones that... They're the ones at fault, not me!
[04:57.00]He really hates us.
[05:04.35]This stream was sponsored by... No, it wasn't.
[05:07.65]Alright, anyways, let's get going.
[05:09.55]We're gonna do Viewtiful Joe.
[05:10.61]If you've never played Viewtiful Joe, I got... People were giving me question marks, and they were saying, like, minus two and shit.
[05:17.27]I was doing references to this game, and they were like, wow, I can't even understand how many of you have never seen this or played this game.
[05:22.71]As I said in the chat, Henshin a go-go, baby!
[05:27.37]And it was like, what the fuck?
[05:29.31]Shut up.
[05:29.71]What are you, dumb?
[05:30.85]Bad?
[05:31.51]What is this reference, huh?
[05:33.63]And I'm just like, wow, I guess I am pretty old, huh?
[05:37.70]We're going to revive Beautiful Joe right now.
[05:42.76]Let's go.
[05:43.80]You're about to see why this game is so beloved.
[05:49.56]This game is awesome.
[05:51.17]It's fast-paced.
[05:52.75]Action.
[05:53.63]There's voices.
[05:54.41]There's voice acting.
[05:56.17]There's characters.
[05:57.51]There's boss fights.
[06:00.01]And there's time manipulation.
[06:02.89]Whoa.
[06:04.51]Some of you just freaked out.
[06:08.70]doing that so we're gonna get started welcome everybody let's play beautiful joe stop fucking doing that new game let's go kids or adults this is hard or easy and this game is very hard but I can't pick I can't pick the kids
[06:32.14]Because if you're on Twitch and you pick the difficulty that says kids, you're not gonna live that down.
[06:42.37]Let's go.
[06:44.97]Oh, by the way, Beautiful Joe's about, like, movies and shit.
[06:46.67]Cool.
[06:50.81]And it's got an awesome soundtrack.
[06:52.13]The soundtrack's fucking, like, 10 out of 10.
[06:54.29]Alright.
[06:55.41]Cool.
[06:56.51]Here's the cutscene.
[06:58.45]This hurts my head looking at this.
[07:05.21]All right, this hurts.
[07:08.54]Should we just do audio only for this part?
[07:11.40]I actually can't look at this.
[07:20.34]Fuck, it's giving me a headache.
[07:24.13]He fights against the dark forces of evil.
[07:28.22]Or what is right.
[07:29.82]This is all that Blue has ever wanted.
[07:32.68]To do the right thing.
[07:34.93]Come on, Blue.
[07:35.81]You have to save the world.
[07:37.09]We can't do it without you.
[07:40.37]Joe, is this your idea of a date movie?
[07:43.65]I had a more romantic time eating popcorn in the lobby.
[07:46.87]Joe, honey.
[07:47.75]Oh, by the way, Dee Bradley Baker, that's the goldfish on American Dad.
[07:51.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Sylvia, cut it out.
[07:55.61]I said cut it out.
[07:56.97]They don't show these old movies all the time, you know.
[07:58.85]I've been looking forward to this forever.
[08:00.53]Well, I've been looking forward to this for a long time, too.
[08:03.72]We haven't been out on a date in forever.
[08:11.24]You can't do this, uh, you can't do that in a movie theater.
[08:14.56]You can't, like... Alright, it's fucking hurting my head again.
[08:24.74]No, you can't do that in a movie theater.
[08:34.93]What do you mean we can't hear it?
[08:35.97]Yes, you can.
[08:41.77]Wait, you can't see or hear?
[08:43.25]Oh, what?
[08:46.43]Oh, man.
[08:48.24]Can you hear it now?
[08:49.60]What the fuck?
[08:55.20]Hey, I've seen this scene before.
[08:56.76]All right, whatever.
[08:57.36]You know why?
[08:57.86]Because this flick hit the screens way back when we were still little babies.
[09:01.68]But that guy in the blue mask, I know I've seen him some... Whoa!
[09:09.19]This game's so good.
[09:11.95]No, stop that!
[09:12.87]Just look away, Jeremy.
[09:15.54]Look away, Jeremy.
[09:18.00]That's an actual seizure warning for real.
[09:21.94]This probably was bad.
[09:41.03]It's a 4D movie.
[09:57.98]4D.
[10:00.90]Joel, the hero.
[10:03.39]Here comes the music.
[10:04.11]Here it comes.
[10:04.57]Here comes the best song in the whole fucking game.
[10:06.15]Oh, my nostalgia meter is going up the charts.
[10:12.52]My moustache meter!
[10:13.88]Hey.
[10:25.08]Wait a minute.
[10:27.90]Am I... Am I inside the movie?
[10:30.47]Correct, my young friend.
[10:33.49]I am Captain Blue.
[10:36.01]I am no longer able to fight because I have been defeated.
[10:40.11]You must take my place as the new action hero.
[10:44.08]That voice, it really is Captain Blue.
[10:48.38]Wow.
[10:49.50]You're the new hero.
[10:50.30]Can I get your autograph?
[10:51.62]No, I am already gone.
[10:54.84]I beg of you to take up the torch of justice, young movie lover.
[11:00.74]Now go.
[11:01.80]The world is in danger.
[11:03.90]Your lady friend is waiting for you.
[11:11.14]Is he gonna say it?
[11:14.07]Is he gonna say it?
[11:18.37]Say it.
[11:18.85]Say it.
[11:21.03]Oh, he didn't say it yet.
[11:26.36]We got huge money that just came in.
[11:27.78]All right, here it comes.
[11:34.02]Joe saw the skull icon that indicated the incoming attack, but it was no match against Joe's smooth moves.
[11:39.63]Joe effortlessly ducked to evade the lethal attack.
[11:46.79]And if he goes for the legs, but if you hit up... Ow, my eyes.
[11:55.15]When you've had enough, press the Z button.
[11:56.55]Here we go.
[12:02.21]Oh, I remember this game so good!
[12:11.92]It's a side-scrolling beat-em-up time travel game.
[12:22.06]Alright, nice.
[12:23.16]This game's so good.
[12:24.20]I'm so fucking happy.
[12:25.70]Yeah, it's crusty because we're in the middle of a fucking pretend movie, guys.
[12:31.50]Oh, fuck, that hurt.
[12:35.45]Alright, hold on.
[12:43.61]We had a huge money come in.
[12:44.39]Let me see it.
[12:46.00]We had 5,000 bits from SirCanine.
[12:48.66]50 fucking dollars from SirCanine.
[12:50.81]What?
[12:51.53]Definitely not resubbing, shaking my head.
[12:53.03]Read the first letter of each line, then watch this.
[12:55.09]What?
[12:55.37]Read the first letter of each line.
[13:17.75]What?
[13:19.89]J-T-L-S-J-J-B-S-I-D?
[13:29.16]I don't understand.
[13:33.76]Read the first letter of each line.
[13:37.90]And watch this with a wink.
[13:42.45]Is that a code?
[13:44.50]What is that?
[13:46.08]Uh, thanks for the $50.
[13:47.63]It's just gibberish.
[13:49.57]Oh.
[13:53.15]I'm, I'm... And then ChunkyBaloney gave $50 back-to-back two fucking huge bits.
[13:58.67]ChunkyBaloney says, That's probably not gonna happen, but thank you for your generosity.
[14:24.15]Thank you both of you.
[14:24.87]That's fucking insane.
[14:26.13]That's huge money right now.
[14:27.51]I haven't even been streaming for 10 minutes.
[14:34.67]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[14:35.77]This is on adult.
[14:36.57]I have to be fucking actually careful.
[14:40.07]I'm gonna die.
[14:40.71]I died.
[14:42.94]I got like taken out of the game.
[14:44.08]I was reading.
[14:44.76]I was paused.
[14:46.32]Then we go.
[14:47.00]Here we go.
[14:52.16]Let's start it over again.
[14:54.29]And who's fucking cheeseburger?
[14:58.96]Oh shit, give me this.
[15:01.98]Ugh, I can only get two.
[15:09.34]Oops.
[15:10.12]Alright, you fight people in waves.
[15:18.55]I'm feeling it.
[15:19.03]I feel it again.
[15:24.13]You can uppercut too, just like in Mortal Kombat.
[15:25.79]Do you think he'll be in Smash?
[15:33.77]Do you think they'll make a beautiful Joe 3?
[15:36.49]And actually utilize this fucking franchise and how good it is?
[15:39.37]You sure?
[15:40.95]You don't think so?
[15:42.77]Capcom has it.
[15:43.69]Well, Capcom's been on, like, the upswing here.
[15:59.34]Alright, this is the first tutorial boss.
[16:00.56]I bet this game is harder than Dark Souls.
[16:12.95]Oh, fuck.
[16:13.35]That hurt.
[16:15.55]It actually is.
[16:16.13]I know it is.
[16:16.55]It actually is.
[16:17.07]I didn't jump over it?
[16:24.22]Just kicked his ass.
[16:28.43]I'm getting A's.
[16:29.33]Okay, just so everyone's aware that Not in a million years Capcom can't even remember what Ken looks like
[17:02.01]Now I get to be the superhero, and I get ten times faster speed, ten times faster attacks, ten times faster punches.
[17:09.56]And I can go like that!
[17:13.70]You can slow down time now.
[17:15.44]And, by the way, there's a speed-up time.
[17:17.56]Spoiler, I just fucked up the whole game for you.
[17:26.24]This is one of the best games on the GameCube.
[17:35.80]You can punch through people and shit.
[17:37.20]This is going to be fucking awesome.
[17:40.94]Like this.
[17:41.24]Ready?
[17:45.02]I love it.
[17:50.60]You got to string combos together.
[17:51.90]You guys love combos.
[17:58.66]This game is like crack.
[17:59.82]Yes, it is.
[18:02.25]I'm glad some- I'm glad some of you guys understand, like, that's- Well, I don't want you to- I don't want to promote, like, smoking crack.
[18:21.61]Oh, isn't there a dodge, too?
[18:25.11]There's like a- there's like an- I was gonna say there's an INDOOR dodge.
[18:29.56]No shit.
[18:36.53]There's no blood in this game?
[18:37.79]Yes, there is!
[18:38.35]There's no blood.
[18:46.26]It's fucking everywhere.
[18:47.30]I just turned it off.
[18:51.22]Wait, give me those.
[18:52.02]I need these V-Bucks.
[18:55.00]I think that's actually what they're called.
[18:56.59]I really think they're actually called V-Bucks.
[18:58.09]I really do think so.
[19:03.05]Shit, I'm terrible.
[19:04.71]Wait.
[19:12.55]Turn on blood.
[19:15.15]Fuck, I have to get them.
[19:20.82]Here, I'm going to squeeze you like an orange.
[19:25.12]What the fuck are you talking about?
[19:31.79]Whatever, I don't care.
[19:34.45]And there's the container.
[19:39.69]I just jumped into that.
[19:45.60]Stopped him.
[19:49.93]Oh!
[19:50.53]Give me the coin.
[19:53.69]Of course there is.
[19:55.11]What are you gonna do?
[20:03.88]It's so fluid.
[20:04.54]The combat is so fucking fluid.
[20:06.18]I know it's the easiest thing to say.
[20:09.14]That's like the simplest fucking way to describe any video game.
[20:11.70]I mean, it's so fluid.
[20:15.29]What'd I get?
[20:15.61]And... Damn it!
[20:24.57]Come on!
[20:27.38]No!
[20:28.34]Oh, wait a minute!
[20:28.98]I can do this!
[20:29.74]I can cheat!
[20:33.16]I forgot I could cheat.
[20:44.05]Alright, now we're gonna do, uh, burger.
[20:45.69]Burger.
[20:45.97]And burger.
[20:47.93]Oops.
[20:53.06]He's cheating, he's cheating, he's cheating.
[20:54.54]I know.
[20:59.90]You missed it.
[21:01.14]I'll get it again, hold on.
[21:04.26]He sucks at cheating.
[21:07.30]You can't suck at cheating.
[21:08.94]You either cheat or you don't.
[21:11.50]Like, if you cheat, you just get, you win.
[21:20.85]Alright, full health.
[21:21.43]Where is it?
[21:21.79]There it is.
[21:22.23]Alright, now let's go again.
[21:24.31]Let's do B. Check.
[21:36.22]Ooh, whoa.
[21:36.68]I didn't even know this was here.
[21:40.74]Oh, I can get them all.
[21:43.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:43.76]I'm not done.
[21:45.37]Oh, I got a D on time because I spent it all doing the fucking...
[21:51.12]I don't even need to slow down time for this.
[21:52.38]Maybe I should.
[21:53.38]Oh god.
[21:53.92]Can they get hit by that too?
[21:58.83]I got 30 beautifuls for that one.
[22:05.45]Oh, by the way, Sekiro stole this from this game.
[22:23.00]Oops.
[22:27.04]Oh, it's so much fun!
[22:29.32]And just wait till I fucking get the flow.
[22:31.44]When I get a good flow, you'll know, because I'll scream.
[22:36.75]Oh, I can break this fucking thing.
[22:38.75]Why would I swear?
[22:39.53]What's the point of swearing there?
[22:40.73]That doesn't do anything.
[22:41.35]There's a double jump, too.
[22:42.89]Well, I didn't know that till right now.
[22:46.94]Oh, I forgot that you can double jump into this shit.
[22:49.56]Seems like he hates this game.
[22:51.86]It sucks.
[22:58.35]and oh I don't want to don't get cocky this guy's kind of kicking my ass oh my god he's gonna kill me
[23:32.81]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[23:34.57]Oh, right, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember.
[23:37.61]Fuck it, alright, right, right, I remember.
[23:39.15]If you get hit when you're... I get it, okay, I remember.
[23:44.70]If you get hit... If you get hit while you're in slow motion, you actually dodge it.
[23:49.76]I forgot about that.
[23:50.56]Where was my fucking... Alright, stop fucking making noise for no reason and play the game.
[24:08.37]There we go.
[24:08.77]Get the fuck out of here.
[24:18.09]Where's my dive kick?
[24:20.17]Was this game even any- okay.
[24:23.72]I was gonna scream, is this game even any good to like push out a bunch of energy?
[24:32.06]I was just gonna scream out a bunch of energy for no reason, but I'm glad I didn't.
[24:37.15]Alright, we're good.
[24:37.71]Let's beat this guy.
[24:40.15]I think I can punch the bullets back, too.
[25:02.05]Oh, fuck.
[25:02.41]That's not how you do it.
[25:08.67]Come on!
[25:09.23]I can't hit it.
[25:16.41]Fuck.
[25:18.85]I can't do this right.
[25:19.53]I'm not punching it?
[25:28.33]How am I not pun- It's gotta be like exact.
[25:31.99]Let me try to- Let me get this right.
[25:34.88]There we go.
[25:36.94]Alright, it's gonna be much more queued.
[25:41.38]There we go.
[25:41.94]I get it.
[25:42.32]I got it.
[25:42.64]Let's go.
[25:50.95]What?
[25:51.71]Give me that book.
[26:03.79]Why are they all using guns?
[26:05.07]Eh, it's kinda not fair, you're right.
[26:12.65]Is there- is there a Crack Stash today?
[26:14.05]I don't think- I don't think there's a Crack Stash today.
[26:20.94]I think that's just normal, uh, I think that's just normal chat, uh, chat is strange.
[26:29.74]Alright, I got them all.
[26:30.78]22 out of 50, that's bad.
[26:35.08]C... ahhh, crappy.
[26:38.24]C for crappy.
[26:40.52]Kick him back.
[26:57.96]What the fuck is a crack stash?
[27:01.43]It's when you have crack stored somewhere in your house.
[27:07.95]I guess.
[27:13.37]Hold on, I'm concentrating.
[27:15.34]I can't really say much because it's a concentration game.
[27:18.58]It's okay.
[27:29.70]Can I land on this?
[27:31.74]No, I can't.
[27:32.36]What the fuck?
[27:32.74]What do you mean can I land on this when it's slow?
[27:34.66]What?
[27:35.32]How would I be able to do that?
[27:39.98]Oh, right.
[27:40.40]I'm turning him off.
[27:41.61]That's cool.
[27:44.45]Right, because you're slowing down time.
[27:45.79]Now this is fucking cool.
[27:50.17]Don't watch this.
[27:51.13]Why would I click a random video?
[27:55.11]I'm not gonna click on, like, a random fucking video.
[27:58.15]Especially when half of you say, don't watch this.
[28:08.05]Like, you're giving me a warning already.
[28:09.66]Wait, can I... I can get up there.
[28:12.76]It's very much to the benefit of getting as many of these V-Bucks as you can, and I'm gonna keep calling it that, I don't care.
[28:18.66]Because it gives you the extra, uh, power bar.
[28:24.71]So hold on.
[28:25.95]How high can this go?
[28:31.29]Fuck, really?
[28:31.85]How do I get up there?
[28:37.19]Oh.
[28:38.07]Well, that makes sense.
[28:41.71]I really think that's what they're called.
[28:43.83]They're like video bucks.
[28:45.37]Yeah, I think they are like the bucks.
[28:46.63]I think that's really what they're called.
[28:50.94]Streamer's gonna get juiced.
[28:57.38]All right, I need a king.
[29:11.24]Ooh.
[29:11.52]I don't know if face came on, please.
[29:19.40]No, I don't like the way I look today.
[29:24.52]I don't like the way that I look today.
[29:25.64]I don't want to move face cam right now.
[29:27.54]I don't like the way that I look today.
[29:39.91]I heard a rumor that you live in a suitcase.
[29:41.45]Is that true?
[29:42.91]Yes, of course it is.
[29:43.47]I'm not going to hide it anymore.
[29:45.47]I live in a suitcase.
[29:48.39]Very big suitcase.
[29:50.23]It's about as large as a house.
[29:51.45]This is a house-sized suitcase, so... Costs a lot of money.
[30:01.50]Oh, you got the key.
[30:06.24]Let's go!
[30:12.60]Alright, I'm about to get my ass kicked over and over and over again from the level boss, because that's what the hard things in this game is, are trying to get the level boss, trying to beat it, and I'm going to get my ass kicked!
[30:25.71]Although I might get another bar.
[30:26.87]I will.
[30:27.35]Alright, time to get my ass kicked!
[30:35.68]Oh, it's the helicopter.
[30:36.74]Fuck.
[30:46.02]All right, I have to move.
[30:49.52]He comes flying by.
[30:51.06]You punch the, uh, things.
[30:52.98]I don't think I can hurt him yet.
[30:55.30]Okay, here we go.
[30:55.66]Fuck.
[30:57.74]All right, I got it.
[31:01.20]I'll get it.
[31:01.46]I'll get it.
[31:01.80]I'll get it.
[31:02.12]Here it comes.
[31:05.55]Come on.
[31:06.03]Come on.
[31:09.09]Yes.
[31:09.69]Good.
[31:12.55]This game is just like Nintendogs.
[31:14.00]You know, you know it is.
[31:15.02]You know it is.
[31:15.60]It actually is.
[31:26.10]Oh, fuck.
[31:26.82]I just ran.
[31:27.54]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[31:28.36]Oh.
[31:32.45]Shit.
[31:35.13]Okay, I gotta kill these guys and not take damage from this shit.
[31:40.09]Oh, wait.
[31:40.27]Here we go.
[31:46.03]There it is.
[31:47.33]And there it is!
[31:54.72]Fuck.
[31:54.84]Okay, it's gotta be in the right spot.
[32:00.94]God damn it.
[32:02.80]Don't do it.
[32:04.24]Don't do it, please.
[32:05.10]Don't do it.
[32:05.48]Don't do it.
[32:06.88]Is there a hamburger over here?
[32:10.32]I gotta jump up, I think, and be in the right... Where is he?
[32:17.23]Nope.
[32:17.45]Alright, I gotta punch him up.
[32:20.39]I'm dead.
[32:23.05]Oh, that was so lucky.
[32:24.11]Alright, I'm dead.
[32:26.59]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[32:28.77]I'm not dead.
[32:32.85]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[32:35.05]I need a hamburger right now.
[32:40.05]What? Aw I fucking walked into it. I'm dead.
[32:45.96]Pleaaaa-

[33:00.35]Did I not punch it? Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[33:09.35]Ah! Goddammit.
[33:22.35]Wait, where am I?
[33:26.57]Wait, what?
[33:29.01]Wait, is it... This is the beginning of the whole fucking entire level.
[33:35.05]Oh, shit.
[33:36.47]So, me dying just to test out how the game worked?
[33:39.57]Oh, that was not very good, was it?
[33:44.72]Because you're on adult mode.
[33:45.94]Oh, right.
[33:47.28]Oh well.
[33:48.05]Oh, let's do it better.
[33:56.87]Well, now I'll get all this shit now.
[33:58.25]That's good.
[34:04.23]Really?
[34:12.63]We're never gonna see level two?
[34:15.64]I just started playing like 10, 15 minutes ago.
[34:18.10]There we go.
[34:41.95]Yeah, I started streaming 30 minutes ago, but I didn't start playing until like 15 minutes ago.
[34:45.84]Alright, I'm not going to get hit one time from this fucking guy.
[34:55.06]Watch this, ready?
[34:55.64]He's dead.
[34:59.57]Level 2.
[34:59.95]Yeah, well you are in a level 2 waiting room.
[35:03.81]Because we're going to get there eventually, and then you're going to get called in.
[35:06.23]You're going to get called into another waiting room for level 3.
[35:16.37]And that cat's going to keep going forever.
[35:21.07]Get off me.
[35:21.47]What the fuck?
[35:21.99]Alright, I want to fill up my beautiful bar.
[35:44.18]Next game waiting room.
[35:45.54]Well, you're gonna have to wait a few days.
[35:46.90]Because this is what we're playing.
[35:51.20]You're gonna be in the waiting room for a couple days.
[35:54.71]Sorry to let you know.
[35:55.69]It's a sleepover time.
[36:18.18]Why do you have so many shitty magazines in here?
[36:19.94]To drive you fucking nuts on purpose.
[36:22.86]Because I know that you're going to be sitting there going, what the fuck does he have?
[36:29.67]Why is there like fucking Better Homes and Gardens from like 2004 here?
[36:33.19]It just is.
[36:34.05]That was the one I got for free.
[36:43.91]I got that one for free.
[36:50.41]I don't even need health.
[36:52.84]I want the money though.
[37:00.84]No, I want the money.
[37:01.58]I want the money.
[37:02.08]I want the money.
[37:02.56]I want the money.
[37:03.00]I want the money.
[37:08.51]Give me the money.
[37:15.33]Worth it.
[37:16.69]I don't need health.
[37:27.50]Alright, got it.
[37:36.11]I don't need the health.
[37:38.79]Alright, let's go.
[37:49.61]Nightbot is a little cocky lately.
[37:52.35]What does that mean?
[37:56.04]Ooh, Nightbot's acting a little cocky.
[38:09.60]All right, I don't want to... I got full health.
[38:11.95]Full everything.
[38:12.57]Time to fight that hind.
[38:22.56]I didn't even have... I had one bar by this point.
[38:26.47]I was playing looking shitty.
[38:30.01]I'm gonna have three bars by the time I get there.
[38:36.25]See you later.
[38:38.53]Remember how much I was going... What the... I don't want to... What the fuck?
[38:42.05]Plenty more.
[38:46.42]I'm gonna get fucking V for beautiful right here.
[38:55.79]Anymore?
[38:56.15]Yup.
[38:57.58]Alright, time to go.
[39:07.56]You want me to increase the FOV?
[39:09.76]Sure.
[39:10.62]Did it work?
[39:20.91]Didn't- How?
[39:21.61]That's weird.
[39:23.33]I'm gonna return the computer.
[39:26.37]I'm gonna send this fucking computer back where I bought it.
[39:37.23]Uppercut him, fuck!
[39:38.03]Alright, no losing to the helicopter here.
[39:41.49]I'm gonna concentrate the fuck out of this guy.
[39:49.46]He's emulating.
[39:51.04]Why is that even... Alright, I got a question for you guys.
[39:54.10]Why is that...
[39:56.46]So, when I told everybody that I wasn't emulating, they went, What?
[40:00.92]Are you fucking stupid?
[40:02.24]What are you dumb?
[40:02.99]Why are you not emulating?
[40:04.65]Ah, you should be emulating.
[40:05.79]What a fucking idiot.
[40:07.37]And now, when I'm on an emulator, which I'm not, but if I'm on an emulator to you guys.
[40:13.59]He's on an emulator.
[40:14.93]What a fucking idiot.
[40:16.23]He's not even on original hardware.
[40:20.92]You see how there's no winning here?
[40:31.53]I still got it.
[40:32.87]No, I didn't punch the thing.
[40:36.59]The only move is to not play.
[40:38.35]There we go.
[40:52.08]That's correct.
[41:03.25]Alright, give me another bar!
[41:05.03]I need at least three or four bars for this.
[41:07.56]I'm on adult mode.
[41:10.72]Crappy, but it's alright.
[41:11.72]45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
[41:16.36]Turn my voice down?
[41:22.30]I think you're the only person in the history of this entire livestream that's ever told me to turn my voice down, not up.
[41:30.88]And we're talking over the course of like seven years.
[41:35.14]That's a very interesting statement.
[41:46.01]Die!
[41:46.57]Why are you still alive?
[41:47.50]Fuck off!
[41:59.72]Whoa, dude, relax.
[42:07.47]Dude, you need to relax.
[42:19.24]Die.
[42:24.74]He doesn't know he's even muted.
[42:28.23]Is there fucking nudity in this game?
[42:34.65]Cool.
[42:36.71]Oh shit, there is.
[42:38.49]Whatever.
[42:40.49]I didn't even look at it.
[42:41.11]I didn't even look at it.
[42:46.53]Come down.
[42:46.91]Kick him down.
[42:47.55]Kick him while he comes down.
[42:48.45]When he comes down, kick him.
[42:49.53]Whatever.
[43:05.46]Bye.
[43:08.88]Grimma won't put face cam on because he's wearing a bra.
[43:12.86]What would that have to do with face cam?
[43:15.76]What would that have to do with having a face cam on?
[43:21.99]It's not, uh, like bra cam.
[43:25.81]Alright, I got three.
[43:27.27]Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, this is, this is hard shit.
[43:30.47]Somebody said they guaranteed I wouldn't beat the first boss.
[43:32.17]Well, that person's about to be dead fucking wrong.
[43:39.57]Oh, come on, really?
[43:42.98]Go.
[43:46.44]Shh, quiet.
[43:46.82]Everybody quiet.
[43:52.72]Come on, get over here!
[43:58.00]That's not gonna work out.
[44:04.12]Oh boy, this is bad.
[44:10.12]I feel like I have to-
[44:18.07]Give me the juice, give me the juice, give me the juice, give me the juice while they all- I gotta kill them all.
[44:20.31]Give me the juice, give me the juice!
[44:21.51]Fuck you!
[44:21.69]God damn it!
[44:41.93]Ah! Agh.
[44:50.36]God damn it.
[44:51.06]This is fucking hard.
[44:52.36]I forgot this game's hard.
[44:54.81]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[45:12.38]You literally said it's harder than Dark Souls earlier.
[45:14.14]Yeah, I know, and it is.
[45:16.32]It is.
[45:27.33]I'm doing this so wrong!
[45:28.49]I can't even make it so I don't get hit five or six of them in front of me.
[45:38.64]I'm going too early, fucker, hold on.

[52:52.55]God, this game's so fucking good.
[52:55.80]If I keep saying that over and over again, people will be like, oh, this game must be good.
[52:58.40]They keep saying it's good.
[52:59.90]It has to be a good game, then.
[53:01.26]Saying it out loud, they can go like, wow, this is fucking good.
[53:03.33]I should like it too.
[53:06.03]Instead of saying, magazine waiting room.
[53:14.39]Oh, dear.
[53:14.81]What is this?
[53:15.33]Oh, boy.
[53:16.39]What?
[53:16.53]Don't kill me.
[53:18.14]Don't kill me, Captain Tutorial.
[53:49.82]No!
[53:51.19]Cut!
[53:51.53]Cut!
[53:51.91]Cut!
[53:54.69]Ready?
[53:55.87]Action!
[53:56.33]Damn it.
[53:58.03]It's all right.
[53:58.43]We're right here.
[54:03.31]That's the beat level two.
[54:14.32]Just kill them!
[54:15.32]Just kill them!
[54:32.57]Excuse me.
[54:39.27]Alright, let's go.
[54:40.19]Let's go, Grandpa.
[54:44.37]Chooses adult and plays like a kid.
[54:45.85]I love it.
[54:46.55]Shh.
[54:47.97]Oh, motherfucker.
[54:48.49]Gotcha!
[55:22.21]I'm not a kid.
[55:26.43]Stop.
[55:28.36]Look, I beat him again.
[55:30.84]I'm not a kid.
[55:32.66]I just did the thing that when you like, when you go out to fucking dinner, and there's a kid's menu, and you're with somebody that's like, eight.
[55:42.32]He's like, oh, what do you want?
[55:43.66]Here's the kids menu.
[55:44.91]I'm not a kid.
[55:46.89]Yes, of course, but here is the four chicken tenders and the macaroni and cheese.
[55:50.95]That's what you like.
[55:53.09]I just did that exact thing.
[55:54.15]All right, Mach Speed.
[55:57.25]Joe grilled every poor soul that stood in his way with his blazing knuckles with electric fast combo attacks.
[56:02.05]He can smash through even distant targets.
[56:05.89]You get super speed.
[56:12.53]It's fast motion.
[56:14.83]So you can go like this.
[56:19.46]Cool, huh?
[56:21.58]You're button mashing.
[56:22.94]Yes, of course I am!
[56:33.91]And you have to use them together.
[56:35.95]Pay attention.
[56:37.45]Jeremy.
[56:42.23]Who cares?
[56:43.11]Just do the one wicked fast one every time.
[56:45.31]Did I see the smash leaks last night?
[56:49.59]No, I didn't see the smash leaks.
[57:01.40]Chicken tendies waiting room.
[57:11.76]Dude, what the fuck?
[57:12.64]Where's the chicken tendies waiting room?
[57:17.40]Can't even fucking see me, dude.
[57:28.95]Can I go up?
[57:31.07]No.
[57:34.60]Craft mac and cheese waiting room.
[57:36.66]Oh, what do I do?
[57:37.64]What do I do?
[57:38.06]What do I do?
[57:38.50]What do I do?
[57:38.94]What do I do?
[57:40.28]I have to run away from it, probably.
[57:44.20]Oh, I'm... Fuck.
[57:47.79]I missed things.
[57:48.91]Oh, whatever.
[57:49.41]I'm not going for a 1,000,000% playthrough.
[57:52.19]Fuck.
[57:52.89]I'm mad about that.
[57:53.51]I'm actually upset.
[58:00.61]Everybody do something.
[58:01.39]Whoop.
[58:07.86]That's a good bonus
[58:25.49]I need to do a Minecraft Let's Play, not ever in a hundred million years.
[58:30.81]In one hundred million years, maybe.
[58:34.75]So, like, dinosaurs would have to, like, we'd have to get dinosaurs to roam the earth again, and go extinct again, before I play a Minecraft Let's Play.
[58:46.78]And then it'd be like, we'd have to caveman, cavemans go through everything again.
[58:54.72]And then maybe... Maybe after that it would progress.
[59:00.12]Flip it.
[59:00.36]Get outta here.
[59:10.63]Another one of these... Oh god, what do I do?
[59:18.38]Slow down?
[59:21.42]Whoa!
[59:30.41]Sorry, I got the food.
[59:31.11]It's all I care about.
[59:32.76]Bad.
[59:33.64]B for bad.
[59:34.66]Here I'm going on a rant waiting room.
[59:42.41]Imagine going to a doctor's office and it's just me.
[59:46.03]Like you have an appointment.
[59:47.99]And it's like, oh yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Albertson.
[59:51.27]I have a 2.30.
[59:52.02]Yeah, go ahead, have a seat.
[59:54.12]And you wait there for like 30 minutes and people come in and go.
[59:56.62]And I just fucking rant at you when you come in.
[60:00.26]I have a stethoscope on my neck.
[60:01.98]I never check your fucking blood or anything.
[60:03.50]I never check your heart or anything.
[60:05.12]You just sit there and I'm just like, you know what?
[60:07.08]I was at the fucking drive-thru yesterday.
[60:08.83]And it's like a 30 or 40 minute session where I just rant to you.
[60:11.27]And then you leave.
[60:15.15]Why do you want that?
[60:23.80]Let them all on fire.
[60:26.42]Yeah, you gotta let them all.
[60:27.32]Did I get it?
[60:31.95]Not quite.
[60:32.45]Oh, set them.
[60:33.47]Uh... Eh.
[60:43.51]That open?
[60:44.69]That shit open?
[60:45.45]Open!
[60:46.21]Fucking open!
[60:54.18]Wow, they were all on fire?
[61:00.04]Wait, is this the room?
[61:00.82]Oh, there's one more over here.
[61:02.24]There's one more.
[61:03.68]I didn't realize it was a fourth one.
[61:19.59]I didn't realize it was a fourth one.
[61:26.12]I did it?
[61:27.30]Wait.
[61:29.10]There's no save point here, though.
[61:30.28]That's not good.
[61:30.86]What should I do?
[61:33.06]Can I buy another life?
[61:43.15]Boomerang.
[61:43.97]A smooth move that lets you use the V-emblem like a boomerang.
[61:46.73]Hold down the punch button.
[61:50.19]Hmm.
[61:54.21]I'll get it.
[61:54.59]Should I save?
[61:56.09]Yeah, I'm gonna save up.
[61:58.99]I feel like I should buy another life.
[62:01.99]Because there's no save point here.
[62:03.31]You know what I mean?
[62:06.50]I feel like I'm gonna need that.
[62:07.90]Alright, just don't die.
[62:12.40]Just don't lose.
[62:14.22]Just don't lose.
[62:27.17]All right, I almost got a full gauge I love that toe oh
[62:57.73]Oh, that's great.
[62:59.47]Oh, I don't like this already.
[63:04.29]Dark Fiend.
[63:06.65]Dark Fiend.
[63:28.10]Gotta play right.
[63:28.44]Isn't there a shark in this one?
[63:29.94]He freaks me out.
[63:30.44]The shark does.
[64:00.85]turns into bats good good
[64:38.40]Do I have to get them all?
[64:39.28]I wish I had that.
[64:44.86]What's that boomerang move?
[64:45.66]I didn't do it.
[64:46.22]Whoa, easy.
[64:47.08]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[64:58.59]Whoa!
[65:10.71]Just kick the shit out of him with this move.
[65:13.61]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[65:25.30]We're fine.
[65:31.10]Did he hit me?
[65:36.26]Holy shit.
[65:36.64]Okay, I'm alright.
[65:42.06]One more?
[65:43.02]He's dead.
[65:43.46]Fuck this guy.
[65:47.86]Dead, dead.
[65:56.60]Dead.
[65:57.70]Yeah, dude.
[66:17.12]Sorry to wake you up.
[66:19.34]You can sleep as much as you want now.
[66:21.64]I just had to.
[66:22.24]Joe wanders into the world of the movies and gallantly fights evil to rescue Sylvia.
[66:28.62]With the help of his superior strength, he is able to reign triumphant over the dastardly bad man, Charles III.
[66:36.53]Why am I a psycho?
[66:38.93]Is she safe?
[66:40.07]Is she even alive?
[66:41.95]Intolerable anxiety tears at Joe's heart.
[66:45.50]What did they do to her?
[66:47.54]Hmm, what would be a good hero name?
[66:51.12]I never thought this would be so hard.
[66:54.96]Searching for Sylvia, Joe tries to track clues as to her whereabouts.
[66:59.26]Little did he know that the clues would only lead him to more problems.
[67:03.69]The next episode is some like it red hot.
[67:08.63]See you there.
[67:14.00]A-A-V-A-A-C-B-B-B-A-B-B-B.
[67:17.98]Pretty good report card, if you ask me.
[67:28.55]Okay, goodbye.
[67:34.31]Episode 2.
[67:42.63]I love this song so much.
[67:44.05]Alright, what we got?
[67:45.93]I want more health.
[67:46.76]I'm gonna need it.
[67:47.72]5,000, mmm... Ooh, combo in the air.
[67:50.14]Combo in the air.
[68:11.85]That's way more important.
[68:12.79]And I'm gonna get an extra life, because I'm a fucking loser.
[68:24.28]What?
[68:24.44]That was loud and crunchy.
[68:31.26]This is DMC?
[68:32.67]It's made by the same people that made that, so that makes sense.
[68:49.76]Here we go.
[68:50.77]This is where the combos start to fly like rain.
[68:55.87]Go all the way.
[69:23.08]Boink.
[69:24.26]Oh, it's so much fun to play.
[69:25.70]Say it again, you may as well thank its goal!
[69:27.62]Say it again, Jeremy!
[69:28.64]Say it again, say it again, say it again!
[69:31.04]Why do you need to say it again?
[69:31.94]Whoa.
[69:51.08]Do it!
[69:52.32]Ahhhh!
[69:52.80]x4 I didn't... What?
[69:59.56]I was ducking.
[70:00.38]I was ducking.
[70:05.51]Can anybody swing?
[70:17.25]Oh!
[70:18.03]I can't even see what's happening on the screen.
[70:36.02]Alright, will you fuck off?
[70:45.43]Kill him.
[70:45.75]Because he's not even on the screen.
[70:48.97]That's what's going on.
[70:49.51]This dude's not even on the fucking camera.
[70:53.83]Alright.
[70:54.87]Whatever.
[70:55.21]Can I keep going this way?
[70:58.80]I don't think I can.
[71:01.78]This game is so good.
[71:02.80]Yes, it is.
[71:03.54]It is so good.
[71:05.43]Ooh.
[71:06.47]What was that?
[71:08.65]What was that big red V thing?
[71:11.29]Okay, well, whatever.
[71:15.54]Well, I know what to do here.
[71:16.34]Eh, kind of.
[71:32.75]Whoa.
[71:34.15]Wait, there's something down here.
[71:39.68]Whoa, what the fuck just did?
[71:43.24]Oh, it's one of the- it's the guy with the- Okay, what the fuck is up with that?
[71:47.40]Give me the burger.
[72:05.86]Close that gap.
[72:07.42]Oh, he's dead.
[72:12.21]What the fuck?
[72:13.43]There's another guy.
[72:21.53]Fuck outta here.
[72:24.10]Alright.
[72:24.30]Oh, a time.
[72:25.32]Please.
[72:30.22]A-A-D.
[72:33.09]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[72:33.97]I know people are gonna say I missed something, but it's alright.
[72:45.08]Dude, can't you already see his fucking moves in Smash Bros?
[72:49.35]Like, that's his upbeat.
[72:51.15]We already know what it looks like.
[73:14.01]You're too slow.
[73:17.09]Am I?
[73:19.51]Oh, yeah?
[73:20.05]Am I?
[73:26.61]Yes.
[73:27.35]I need a hamburger.
[73:34.31]Everyone does the same thing in Smash.
[73:38.60]That's not accurate.
[73:40.58]Can I go down?
[73:43.46]Oh, fuck.
[73:43.94]Okay, hold on a second.
[73:45.46]This is just a... Oh.
[73:49.00]Wait, can I... Shit.
[73:58.98]Hold on.
[73:59.34]Can I hit them both at the same time?
[74:00.53]No!
[74:01.53]No!
[74:14.16]Dude, you're down B?
[74:16.04]Have a down B. I don't have the power up yet.
[74:23.16]That's unfortunate.
[74:24.16]Oh well.
[74:29.99]He lacks critical information.
[74:33.09]Yes, he does.
[74:44.79]He's gonna be a Mii costume when they add Phoenix Wright to Smash.
[74:50.65]What on earth would they add Phoenix?
[74:52.42]Ah, I can't say that.
[74:53.30]They added a fucking Wii Fit trainer.
[74:55.90]Right?
[74:56.38]Like, that doesn't work.
[75:07.72]Did you just hit me?
[75:19.20]Kick him in the air, kick him in the air.
[75:20.18]Now I got... Oh, I went the wrong way.
[75:23.12]What an asshole.
[75:30.93]No!
[75:31.63]How do I avoid that?
[75:44.17]What?
[75:57.66]Don't die!
[75:58.50]Don't die!
[75:59.36]Ooooooh!
[76:09.74]Alright, I got it.
[76:10.32]He's down.
[76:10.60]BB!
[76:10.68]I just realized he's got, like, a big fat stomach.
[76:14.61]VBD?
[76:14.77]What time zone is that?
[76:37.85]Uh, virtual something time.
[76:40.25]The final VFX power is on!
[76:43.43]Check out the extreme zoom on that good-looking Joe.
[76:47.19]Watch his enemies freeze.
[76:48.41]Okay, Joe, you got their attention, now give them something to look at!
[77:03.02]Oh, I can do it now!
[77:04.02]I can do it now.
[77:06.02]You can do the zoom.
[77:06.88]The pose.
[77:07.40]Is he doing the pose?
[77:10.10]He ascends like a raging twister and his descent makes the world shine.
[77:13.14]The light of Joe is the hammer that smashes through the darkness of evil.
[77:18.34]Jump!
[77:19.98]Uh-huh.
[77:23.21]Back down again.
[77:24.13]Cool.
[77:26.95]Alright, let's go get it.
[77:38.94]That's cool.
[77:39.46]Alright, let's go get that activation thing.
[77:52.06]How do I do it?
[77:52.52]How do I go?
[77:53.24]Oh, that's how.
[77:53.76]Okay, I get it.
[77:58.18]Let's go back and do that thing.
[78:02.96]He sounds like he hates this game.
[78:04.47]What?
[78:07.25]How do you tell if I like a game?
[78:09.61]How does that work?
[78:15.42]Here we go, ready?
[78:24.38]Secret!
[78:25.81]You beat the game in a single stream.
[78:27.39]Now that's... I see where you're going on this one.
[78:30.25]I see what you're doing here.
[78:40.39]What?
[78:40.63]Oh, come on.
[78:41.71]It went through the fucking wall.
[78:44.01]Can I get up there?
[78:51.50]Oh, I can, I can, I can.
[78:52.30]Okay, go on.
[78:57.96]Gotta go like this.
[79:00.89]Oh, I can only do it twice.
[79:03.39]Shit, how do I get up there?
[79:10.25]Just fill up the shit Okay, is that it Oh, well, I guess I have to stay here is this poisonous Oh, there's a fucking laser right here
[79:42.59]Don't!
[79:43.31]Ugh.
[79:56.55]You have to zoom with the C-stick.
[79:59.77]C-stick zooms.
[80:02.11]Alright, I gotta run by this really fast.
[80:05.74]This is a lot of free V-Stuff.
[80:09.48]This is working out pretty well.
[80:12.67]Almost have the second little unlockable.
[80:16.25]Oh, bad.
[80:25.43]Zoom's breaking me out a little.
[80:27.11]Oh, shit.
[80:29.00]Fuck.
[80:32.26]Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[80:44.24]Did I miss one?
[80:45.97]Get the fuck off me!
[80:47.71]I'm gonna hit that.
[80:48.37]Oh!
[80:51.07]Where?
[80:51.35]Oh, I'm down at the bottom.
[80:55.11]Okay.
[80:55.61]Um, come down here.
[81:01.25]Get down here!
[81:07.33]Where the fuck is it?
[81:15.08]There it is.
[81:17.72]I wouldn't care, but I'm so close.
[81:26.08]Just go for it!
[81:42.60]I need help.
[81:44.44]You are crappy.
[81:46.50]That's alright.
[81:50.35]There's so many fucking bats everywhere!
[82:01.82]Okay, that comment was actually pretty funny.
[82:04.14]Like, what the fuck was that comment?
[82:06.43]That comment was so stupid.
[82:09.75]That comment said, what did it say?
[82:11.29]Hold on.
[82:14.24]Jeremy, you can't play Beautiful Joe.
[82:16.54]You haven't played VR in so long.
[82:18.36]Why won't you play VR?
[82:19.60]Beautiful Joe goes brrrr.
[82:22.77]Okay, I have to pay attention.
[82:28.37]That was the dumbest thing ever.
[82:33.33]It was just fucking nonsense.
[82:38.82]You can't play Beautiful Joe.
[82:39.88]Beautiful Joe, you haven't played VR in so long.
[82:41.87]Why wouldn't you play VR?
[82:42.69]A Beautiful Joe comes first.
[82:46.63]Alright, turn this shit off!
[82:49.85]I need to plug this in.
[82:50.73]How do I pick this up?
[83:02.52]There's a plug on the ground.
[83:03.70]How do I do this?
[83:08.80]Is it better?
[83:09.22]Is this gonna kill me?
[83:17.97]He hates completing games.
[83:19.23]He missed V-Bucks.
[83:20.33]Is that not even the same plane?
[83:23.25]Bingo!
[83:28.31]Oh god.
[83:39.69]Whoa!
[83:40.01]All right, I gotta pay attention to what guy this.
[83:53.58]Who the fuck are you?
[83:57.16]Stop screaming.
[84:06.20]Dodged it twice.
[84:08.72]Magic!
[84:12.04]That didn't hit him?
[84:15.56]Fire!
[84:17.92]Fire!
[84:21.10]Oh my god, you're f***ing pissing me off.
[84:27.24]Alright, get him!
[84:35.95]Oh my god, I held the button down too long.
[84:41.84]Just do it slow
[85:16.40]Oh, sorry.
[85:17.20]Somebody said he's dead?
[85:19.82]Is he?
[85:21.84]Is he, though?
[85:27.50]Oh, is he, though?
[85:28.34]How do I get this?
[85:35.40]Oh, I have to zoom in on this, don't I?
[85:39.98]I want food.
[85:50.58]Heck, I should say sorry.
[85:53.08]I can see it just fine.
[85:56.67]I don't even need this.
[85:58.59]Thanks for the blue again.
[86:01.69]Again.
[86:02.31]Ah, I want money too.
[86:03.17]No, don't do three in a row!
[86:15.45]You have to- You haven't played VR in so long.
[86:18.58]Why?
[86:18.98]What the fuck?
[86:19.56]This is bullshit.
[86:20.66]Beautiful joke goes brrrr.
[86:28.04]Can I put- Can I put that as like my favorite comment of the year?
[86:34.76]We'll go back to VR in a little bit.
[86:38.03]In a little bit, just relax.
[86:43.01]How do I get this box?
[86:49.71]How do I get this?
[86:59.16]Zoom.
[86:59.88]Can I get it?
[87:01.62]I can't get it.
[87:05.10]Zoom.
[87:05.58]It doesn't work.
[87:13.28]Just Mach Speed.
[87:15.36]Had to hit it with a Red Hot.
[87:17.66]By timing the Slava Shave with the Mach Speed attack.
[87:19.82]That's not gonna work.
[87:21.77]You have to hit enemies.
[87:22.79]Jump jump!
[87:29.75]When am I gonna stream on Zoom?
[87:31.05]I don't even know what that is.
[87:39.66]Alright, here we go.
[87:40.96]Back to normal.

[87:46.56]Uppercut.
[87:47.04]Slide.
[87:47.88]Slide attack.
[87:48.56]Uppercut.

[87:51.46]Are you kidding me?
[87:53.69]How did that happen?
[87:59.63]Two of these people are driving right now.
[88:08.28]Come on.
[88:12.40]Huge jump.

[88:34.37]Jerma, please.
[88:35.11]Play a game.
[88:35.55]Jerma, I'm begging you.
[88:36.65]Jerma, hello.

[88:38.15]Jerma, please.
[88:38.71]Hello.
[88:39.03]Jerma, play something else.
[88:47.71]You can't just play what you find fun with the fans, and we want VR now.
[88:52.99]You haven't played VR in so long.
[88:57.56]Hold on, I'll put this on the screen.
[89:21.06]That's just like, what the fuck is this?
[89:26.72]It's the money.
[89:31.26]Oh, I want to get up there.
[89:36.35]You can't do this.
[89:37.11]We're the fans.
[89:37.71]We want this.
[89:39.07]You haven't done it in so long.
[89:42.15]Oh, wait.

[92:06.65]All right, we're gonna do this again?
[92:19.07]How do I get over there now?
[92:21.48]I missed the cool thing.

[92:46.70]I'm in a funny laughing mood now.
[92:50.52]Now he's padding for time.
[92:56.10]Did I just get hit by the fucking bus while I was on the bus?
[93:07.76]How long do I have to sit on this board?
[93:15.60]How long do I have to hold the button for?
[93:20.48]Did that work?
[93:42.55]You have to get the thing to go really fast and then you have to speed up time Don't do speed just just only slow really
[94:10.03]Let's go!
[94:24.17]Maybe just don't hold it down, just tap it a little bit?
[94:38.50]Okay, that's weird.
[94:46.89]Shit.
[94:47.25]Oh, I can get it.
[94:51.79]Wait, what?

[96:44.19]Ah!
[96:44.51]I got it!
[96:44.91]No, I didn't.
[96:45.33]What?
[96:46.58]Stop flexing into the camera!
[96:53.72]That shit distracted me so fucking much that I think I just lost it.
[97:42.73]Oh, I thought he was gonna go all the way around to the other side.
[97:46.21]Fuck.
[97:47.22]I didn't know he was gonna turn around that quickly.
[97:50.38]Fuck.
[97:51.62]Whatever.
[97:55.50]Alright, that's fine.
[98:01.72]I still don't understand why I can't hit that thing.
[98:03.54]Alright, well I got full health.
[98:23.17]Come on, you fucking idiot.
[98:39.24]Do it!
[98:40.14]Do it!
[98:43.48]Why did he not do it?!
[98:45.25]Took so long to swing at me!
[99:00.82]Did I just actually get hit?
[99:02.10]You motherfucker.
[99:03.02]You gotta be kidding me.
[99:06.25]Oh my god.
[99:06.87]I gotta sit up.
[99:07.45]I'm being fucking stupid.
[99:14.63]I can't just... Okay.
[99:15.73]Come on.
[99:21.23]Come here.
[99:21.47]Do it.
[99:22.33]I'm gonna attack.
[99:22.85]This way.
[99:35.74]That's what I wanted to see.
[99:40.41]Ah!
[99:57.72]Ooh, okay, I got one hit.
[100:10.06]I can't cheat like that.
[100:11.26]It's alright.
[100:16.19]There we go.
[100:20.45]There we go.
[100:22.43]Whoops.
[100:22.69]Stupid dumb fucking idiot.
[100:28.34]Stupid dumb fucking idiot.
[100:29.20]Stupid fucking idiot.
[100:32.04]Alright.

[100:38.58]Why am I not fucking hitting anybody?
[100:40.36]Ah, what?
[100:40.86]Oh boy, this is bad.
[100:53.73]It's okay.
[101:06.08]It's alright.
[101:06.96]I got it.
[101:14.05]What am I doing?
[101:14.63]Don't jump into it.
[101:15.37]What are you fucking crazy?
[101:22.54]I went, I wanted to go the other way.
[101:40.02]God, that was fucking hot.
[101:56.60]Everybody said he wasn't gonna get angry?
[101:57.76]I don't think I'm getting angry.
[101:59.76]I think I'm getting... I'm getting involved.
[102:03.53]Getting involved.
[102:09.53]Alright, I got points.
[102:10.31]I need to spend these points.
[102:13.24]Take two.
[102:13.72]Even if all your lives are gone, restart from the point where you died.
[102:15.92]That's pretty good.
[102:16.74]That's really important.
[102:20.66]How often can this be activated?
[102:28.72]That's a lot of V-Bucks.
[102:29.84]Yeah, but... Buy more life?
[102:35.58]Yeah, that's true.
[102:36.62]It's probably a one-time use.
[102:43.77]I actually don't remember.
[102:44.63]It might be.
[102:49.63]Alright, Shocking Pink.
[102:52.14]Should I try this?
[102:55.04]Let me get the Vroomerang.
[102:57.92]Hold down the punch button.
[103:01.68]Do I have enough for another life?
[103:05.62]No.
[103:05.78]I have enough for... I'm getting it.
[103:10.99]I don't even care.
[103:32.30]don't get hit okay that's good advice a rhino hotel all right this is maybe this is what we have to fight I'm getting strange flashbacks right now of this level specifically the boss of this level and being very upset
[104:01.83]Something about it, I don't know what it was.
[104:04.07]Something about this though.
[104:05.41]Alright, how do I do this kick thing?
[104:06.75]Oh, it's a bomb.
[104:07.99]How do I use it?
[104:08.53]Do I just kick it?
[104:10.43]Oh shit, it just sits there.
[104:37.07]Where's he going?
[104:38.51]What if Reddit was real?
[104:40.40]Reddit is real.
[104:41.86]Reddit is a real website.
[104:42.88]I remember playing Beautiful Joe 2 when I was a kid.
[104:49.38]Those were some good times.
[105:00.07]Really?
[105:00.37]I turned it off right when I got hit.
[105:01.69]Just talking to you.
[105:15.75]I want Beautiful Joe 3.
[105:16.73]I think all of us do.
[105:18.99]Anybody that's really ever played this series definitely is, like, so... just wants one so bad.
[105:25.99]I don't think we'll ever get one, unfortunately.
[105:27.60]It's the sad truth.
[105:31.06]It is the sad truth.
[105:33.18]Oh, didn't go up there.
[105:36.30]Red Hot Rumble is good.
[105:37.30]I never played it.
[105:37.96]That's the one where they did, like, a Smash Bros., right?
[105:44.57]Oh, I can't sit on that?
[105:50.08]Can I not stand on that?
[105:56.56]I cannot stand on that, huh?
[105:59.76]Oh, that's annoying.
[106:01.64]Doesn't work at Capcom anymore.
[106:07.57]No!
[106:13.37]Wait.
[106:22.18]to knock these down?
[106:23.98]What am I missing here?
[106:27.94]How old was I when this came out?
[106:29.68]I was 17?
[106:30.22]Was I?
[106:31.26]What am I supposed to do here?
[106:42.87]Oh, I've been missing subs!
[106:45.25]I've got seven community subs from DedoDedo.
[106:48.35]Thanks for the seven subs.
[106:49.17]We also had five from JermaSucks.
[106:52.44]You know, that guy sucks.
[106:55.88]Thanks to the two of you subs.
[106:57.60]He hates subs.
[106:58.60]Ah, there we are.
[107:01.28]I knew I'd find it eventually.
[107:10.38]Why is he so mean?
[107:12.39]What was I mean to a viewer?
[107:13.51]When was the last time I was mean to a viewer?
[107:19.17]What a dumb thing to say.
[107:30.56]Okay.
[107:31.14]Can I get over there?
[107:32.16]I still don't get that.
[107:39.31]I don't understand.
[107:40.69]How do I go to the other plane?
[107:43.47]He's evil.
[107:59.32]You're always on the same plane.
[108:00.60]Yeah, but how come I can't go on the same, on that, that, the same plane as the yellow box?
[108:05.68]That's what I'm saying.
[108:11.19]He asked me if a card was mine, and it wasn't.
[108:13.15]This is the worst stream.
[108:25.60]Ooh, I see something over there!
[108:30.19]get to hit the enemies into the background boxes.
[108:31.91]I was trying to do that earlier.
[108:33.89]I guess I'm just not good enough at it.
[108:35.71]Okay, now.
[108:40.71]Got a key.
[108:55.48]Double red hot kick.
[108:56.38]Oh!
[109:02.77]Beautiful fucking kill.
[109:03.61]You know, I will say, though, I'll kick it off with the VR stuff.
[109:13.65]We will probably put that helmet back on sooner than you think.
[109:16.33]Because, like I said, over the last, like, probably two or three weeks of sitting down less, I've actually started to feel a little bit more loose and I've been feeling a little better.
[109:28.28]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[109:39.04]get it come on slide oh that's you just hate to see that double all right what do I do with this
[110:06.82]The green screen?
[110:07.46]Yes.
[110:08.38]The green screen stream will be sooner than you think it will be.
[110:15.76]Soon.
[110:17.24]Probably within the next 30 days.
[110:25.18]I hope so.
[110:26.28]That's what the plan is.
[110:32.71]I gotta knock you into that shit.
[110:42.84]Did I not?
[110:43.48]Oh, really?
[110:45.02]Reloading?
[110:51.78]Fire!
[110:53.60]Fire!
[110:56.11]I wanna knock you into this.
[110:56.93]Alright, here we go.
[111:00.17]I'm gonna try to knock you into this shit.
[111:02.81]Nope.
[111:03.39]I gotta get an uppercut right here.
[111:09.63]Fuck!
[111:11.31]No!
[111:13.31]Hey, sorry I'm late.
[111:13.99]Start the stream over.
[111:14.83]Alright.
[111:16.17]Hey, what's going on guys?
[111:17.11]How are you doing?
[111:17.71]So what did I find here?
[111:18.46]I'm gonna lie about Hulk.
[111:20.86]I didn't lie about Hulk.
[111:25.92]Hulk is being delivered.
[111:28.45]At some point.
[111:30.49]In the future.
[111:44.62]I don't get our hopes up about Hulk ultimate destruction.
[111:52.10]I'm not gonna.
[111:53.90]What makes you think I would get your hopes up about Hulk ultimate destruction too?
[111:57.50]Should I be concerned about this?
[112:16.20]Oh, there's a bomb!
[112:16.64]Am I good?
[112:30.44]Oh, I gotta do this before it gets over here.
[112:31.90]Oh shit, I get it.
[112:39.65]Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[112:49.00]Oh my god, really?
[112:49.76]Oh no!
[112:58.56]No, I need to... God damn it!
[113:02.39]God damn it!
[113:09.19]It's almost here!
[113:10.03]It's here!

[113:29.04]The Hulk is here.
[113:30.12]Hulk is in the building.
[113:35.16]Come on.
[113:46.85]Come on.
[113:52.26]Why do I need to slow that down?
[113:53.39]Is this the bomb puzzle?
[113:56.33]No, this is not the bomb puzzle.
[113:58.57]It's not the bomb puzzle.
[114:00.19]Alright.
[114:03.17]It might be the bomb puzzle.
[114:04.95]Got it on the first fucking try.
[114:06.37]No, I didn't.
[114:20.80]I just got hit four fucking times in a row, I think.
[114:23.94]What just happened?
[114:24.58]Do something.
[114:29.10]Swing at me.
[114:36.61]I know what to do.
[114:44.65]Got it.
[114:45.11]No, I didn't.
[114:55.27]Oh shit, this is the hard one.
[114:56.40]This is the one they were talking about.
[114:57.92]Oh, okay, you gotta do it slow the whole time.
[115:02.84]Slow!
[115:05.64]Just get out of the fucking way.
[115:07.70]Oh, you're annoying.
[115:08.40]Shit.

[129:53.97]Get the fuck over there so I can hit him with the red hot kick.
[130:00.63]Oh, that was pretty good.
[130:04.27]That was what we call pretty good.
[130:05.61]This dude thinks we're real.
[130:12.91]You are.
[130:18.41]Alright, I did that for one person.
[130:20.09]I don't want that.
[130:22.12]Health.
[130:29.98]I want the HP.
[130:33.30]Good.

[130:49.27]Joker made it into smash before beautiful joe.

[130:53.39]What's up with that?
[130:56.57]People drive has way more fans me burger boy A hundred of you That's optimistic
[131:22.21]That's optimistic?
[131:23.51]I don't think it is.
[131:24.31]People love this character.
[131:25.31]This is like one of the most beloved GameCube characters ever.
[131:27.89]Alright, boss time.
[131:40.04]I got two chances to not fuck this all up.
[131:44.95]Just don't mess it up.
[131:50.25]Oh!
[131:51.61]Ugh.
[131:53.52]Oh, we're good.
[131:56.70]Okay.
[132:00.98]Alright.
[132:12.20]Here we are.
[132:12.84]We're gonna get an opportunity to get another beautiful dog.
[132:23.62]Oh, that was pretty good.
[132:31.28]I love when you just do that side swing slash.
[132:34.30]You know, none of you know what I'm talking about.
[132:35.88]I don't even know what I'm talking about.
[132:39.88]All right, got it.
[132:49.43]Come on.
[132:57.54]Make a pizza?
[133:00.48]You think I should make a pizza?
[133:05.47]I love pizza.
[133:15.73]And speaking of pizza... I'm gonna go pee.
[133:20.40]I know that it makes no sense, but we're at a breakpoint here.
[133:22.50]I'm gonna go pee up your back.
[133:23.84]See ya.
[136:17.06]Hey.
[136:21.67]Everyone needs what?
[136:22.83]Photos?
[136:24.45]We can play Patapon 2.
[136:25.33]I gotta play Patapon 1 before I play Patapon 2, don't you think?
[136:28.65]Doesn't that make more sense?
[136:33.86]Alright, I got money.
[136:40.98]Hmm...
[136:43.91]Double the rate of recovery on your VFX gauge.
[136:46.11]That's so good.
[136:49.71]That's... I would say that's probably the most important thing in the whole game.
[136:54.91]Mach speed.
[136:55.89]Have up to four of yourself appearing and moving at mach speed.
[136:58.58]Mmm.
[137:06.08]In slow, dodge enemy attacks and zoom in.
[137:08.56]So dodge and then zoom.
[137:09.58]This is also take two.
[137:12.10]And I need to...
[137:12.85]I'm gonna go with Mox Speed.
[137:22.33]Mox Speed and... I'm not gonna use this shit, I don't think.
[137:29.40]Another health?
[137:30.72]Take the extra health?
[137:32.06]Or the take two?
[137:33.78]Take two, oh god.
[137:37.12]Take two, oh god.
[137:41.83]Should I?
[137:46.12]Take two now.
[137:46.84]Alright, I got it.
[137:48.70]Is there a save point?
[137:54.40]Of course there's not.
[137:56.26]Alright, I gotta play well because there's no save point here.
[137:58.30]I gotta do this right.
[138:00.95]I got two chances to beat this.
[138:03.39]Otherwise I can do the whole thing over again.
[138:04.83]I'm ready.
[138:07.61]J. This is the sucky room.
[138:14.73]Oh.
[138:17.01]This one's the one that sucks.
[138:28.43]Wait.
[138:30.27]I- I do remember this.
[138:34.77]I remember getting so... That- the- the- the- the screaming.
[138:38.99]He says the same line over and over again.
[138:42.27]Yep, I remember this, and you end up falling all the way down.
[138:44.43]You hear him say, Yeah, I remember this.
[138:47.53]Here we go.
[138:58.94]Oh, God.
[138:59.74]Okay, so hold on.
[139:01.18]This goes up here, and then it's got a light, and then...
[139:17.14]Get used to hearing that.
[139:27.80]Up the wall.
[139:29.72]He's going to block.
[139:33.31]He's going to get it.
[139:43.97]Don't touch it hold on
[140:12.49]It's gonna explode it's gonna explode it's gonna explode it's gonna explode Oh
[140:43.03]You just have to nudge it with your body.
[140:46.72]There you go, ready?
[140:52.58]Oh, you piece of shit!
[140:58.14]Alright, I need a full charge here.
[141:11.09]Fill it up.
[141:13.05]And then I gotta wait till it's full.
[141:20.78]It's a good sub sound if I still had him.
[141:22.66]Got it.
[141:37.43]Okay.
[141:38.09]Good.
[141:38.59]Cool.
[141:39.25]Uh, Zorro Carlos gave 10,000 bits.
[141:41.23]I just got $100 from Zorro Carlos.
[141:44.35]Thanks for the $100.
[141:44.91]He said,
[142:00.46]Since then, I took some therapy and have successfully recovered from my very, very long depression.
[142:05.39]I've now been accepted into an art school to study animation.
[142:07.75]That's fucking awesome.
[142:09.55]And once again, I want to show you my appreciation for being a light in those dark times.
[142:14.86]Thanks a lot, Carlos.
[142:16.74]I wish you the absolute best.
[142:18.34]I'm glad you have gone on the path here.
[142:23.40]Sounds like you're doing pretty good.
[142:25.21]That's really great to hear.
[142:30.96]Nice fucking work.
[142:32.20]Awesome.
[142:35.62]Getting into a fucking school.
[142:37.52]Studying shit.
[142:38.72]Animation.
[142:39.20]Maybe you can try animating this.
[142:51.37]Ego.
[142:52.47]Immediately.
[142:53.37]Maybe you can try animating me.
[142:55.76]Is that an ego?
[142:56.98]Fuck.
[142:58.48]I gotta like
[143:01.22]I'm gonna, like, go on a fucking mountain retreat or something.
[143:04.64]I'm gonna, like, get on the top of the mountain and just breathe.
[143:07.14]And then maybe it'll go away, right?
[143:14.40]Well, that will go away.
[143:16.82]Will I still... Will I be on the mountain just being like, ah, alright, I see how it's supposed to be now.
[143:22.71]And then when I'm, like, on the car driving home...
[143:26.67]There's a red light.
[143:27.89]And I'm just like, why is this red light red?
[143:29.25]It should be green for me.
[143:31.21]I should have a fucking green light right now.
[143:33.06]Why is this red?
[143:34.84]Because that's probably going to happen.
[143:36.54]Because that happens every time I pull up to a red light.
[143:40.60]But thanks for the 10,000 fucking bits, dude.
[143:42.22]I'm glad you're doing well.
[143:43.64]And then Chunky Bologna gave 20 community subs because they said if I did it in 5 minutes, they were going to give 20 subs.
[143:49.98]And there they are.
[143:57.45]There they are.
[143:57.95]Thanks a lot, Chunky Baloney.
[144:00.33]I love this guy.
[144:04.51]Save!
[144:26.83]Iron Ogre, Hulk Davidson.
[144:44.98]I'm gonna get my ass kicked Here we go
[145:17.52]What do we do?
[145:18.22]Pause.
[145:18.62]He's going this way.
[145:19.62]He's going to swing up!
[145:26.60]Alright, he blocks.
[145:27.48]Wait until he swings.
[145:34.24]Don't get cocky.
[145:35.10]He's a tough boss.
[145:35.86]Alright, I'm running out of power here.
[145:41.17]Oh god, what's he doing?
[145:46.35]Oh, he just whacked him.
[145:48.29]Whoa!
[145:48.59]What's that?
[145:49.76]He's doing a move?
[145:51.60]Oh, he's got missiles and shit.
[146:03.86]He blocks it?
[146:04.42]Okay, I have to knock him down and then... What the hell is this?
[146:10.30]More of these?
[146:12.78]Oh, I'm on fucking fire!
[146:14.04]I think I have to run fast to get that off.
[146:23.84]Because he blocks.
[146:31.61]I have to make him... Okay, I gotta get him off guard.
[146:34.49]Ready?
[146:34.67]So here we go.
[146:35.07]Check this out.
[146:37.12]Here we go.
[146:39.18]Boom.
[146:48.72]He's going to go for it.
[146:49.44]He smashes his head.
[146:50.84]And that's when you go like this.
[146:51.92]And I missed.
[146:53.70]And I... That's okay.
[146:57.84]Give me that shit.
[147:00.81]Wow, that hurt.
[147:03.07]I want that... Ah, fuck.
[147:09.01]Swing at me, mother of pearl.
[147:14.41]He's going to run?
[147:24.38]Oh, fuck.
[147:25.02]Please.
[147:25.36]Swing.
[147:33.56]Did I jump around him?
[147:34.62]I guess you jump behind him.
[147:40.35]No, I guess it's going alright.
[147:41.51]Fuck.
[147:49.63]Okay, here we go.
[147:50.97]Swing.
[147:54.96]It's a real wink?
[147:55.88]It can't be a wink.
[147:56.92]There's no such thing as a real wink right now.
[148:07.30]No!
[148:07.54]I'm too far away!
[148:08.86]I'm doing alright.
[148:11.36]Slow and steady.
[148:27.07]I have more than what?
[148:28.77]I just got killed in one hit!
[148:32.81]Why did I look over a chat?
[148:33.83]What was the point of that?
[148:35.95]I wonder where they're staying.
[148:36.89]Did he throw his axe?
[148:57.54]Why the fuck would I look over a chat in a game that you have to pay attention to every second of the game?
[149:02.24]Why would I do something like that?
[149:03.82]It was going so well.
[149:07.25]Alright, just don't get touched.
[149:44.04]Back it up!
[149:45.80]I can't believe he just almost killed me!
[149:49.50]Oh shit, what does that do?
[149:59.67]Can I...?
[150:02.22]OOOOH!
[150:03.10]He was gonna swing!
[150:09.20]I thought he was gonna catch me in mid-air.
[150:22.02]Fire, man, fire!
[150:23.44]I'm alive!
[150:41.93]Oh my god, it's take two!
[150:43.71]Take two!
[150:44.36]I'm so glad I bought it.
[150:58.62]Two men.
[151:14.80]That didn't even fucking hit him!
[151:23.17]Alright, don't be greedy.
[151:27.85]He's finally zooming.
[151:29.71]Frog!
[151:40.43]Oh my fuck.
[151:47.16]Where is he?
[151:48.48]Where is he?
[151:48.76]Where is he?
[151:49.04]Where is he?
[151:49.34]Where is he?
[151:52.22]He's over here.
[151:57.94]I had to fucking block it.
[152:07.87]Why am I wasting this ball?
[152:09.89]Jeremy, what are you doing?
[152:13.65]Just do it the way I was doing it before.
[152:29.89]What am I fighting for?
[152:34.09]What is happening?
[152:35.20]This cannot go on.
[152:37.86]What am I fighting for?
[152:39.38]Oh, wow.
[152:51.79]Just figured out how to fucking fight the boss.
[153:20.18]You can't handle it, you can't handle it!
[153:21.34]Uh-oh.
[153:28.02]Uh-oh!
[153:28.34]Uh-oh!
[153:35.00]What, he was in the air!
[153:36.25]Fuck no!
[153:50.88]Smart plays only.
[153:51.68]Okay, don't be fucking stupid!
[154:15.53]Fuck!
[154:16.37]No!
[154:16.67]No!
[154:17.45]No!
[154:33.81]Where is he?
[154:34.95]Oh!
[154:39.64]I'm fine.
[154:56.44]Where's the fire?
[154:56.92]Where's the fire?
[154:57.42]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[155:01.34]There's a fire, fire, fire.
[155:02.24]There's a fire, there's a fire, fire, fire.
[155:03.80]Okay.
[155:12.29]Break it.
[155:12.89]Where's his... He's dead.
[155:25.03]You little punk.
[155:29.38]That was way more intense than I think it should have been.
[155:34.56]That's a pretty good YouTuber reaction.
[155:37.10]I'm amped the fuck up!
[155:54.56]The shadow, seeking to stretch their evil power to the ocean itself, had planted a bomb in the underwater city of Moon.
[156:02.10]Oh, I remember this.
[156:02.66]Yeah, this guy.
[156:03.44]Water was starting to flood the city.
[156:06.03]Thousands of lives were at risk.
[156:08.25]Joe had no choice but to abandon the search for Sylvia and race to rescue the innocents of Moon.
[156:15.88]This is horrible.
[156:17.22]I can't even read this junk.
[156:19.24]But more importantly, a superhero needs a super ride.
[156:23.81]Pretty bad handwriting.
[156:26.87]And embarks on a mission to save the underwater city.
[156:30.79]Don't forget to see the next installment, Two Million Leagues Under the Sea.
[156:36.43]Till then, ta-ta.
[156:39.62]B-B-B-B-C-B-A-A-B-B-B-C-C-C-B.
[156:47.32]Okay.
[156:47.58]We did it.
[157:15.46]That was a terrible streamer.
[157:17.56]I haven't continued since the tutorial level.
[157:20.40]What are you talking about?
[157:21.12]I don't have enough for anything.
[157:32.85]Just save him.
[157:45.96]It continued on the tutorial level.
[157:49.54]Yes, I did.
[157:53.91]Two million leagues under the sea.
[158:02.70]Wait, what?
[158:04.26]Oh, this is awesome.
[158:06.44]It's like Cuphead.
[158:15.32]Plenty of practice on this one.
[158:16.34]I played Ikaruga.
[158:28.53]Oh, I can do a huge bullet.
[158:32.55]Ooh, hey.
[158:37.33]Oh, it's like a dodge.
[158:38.01]Okay.
[158:38.31]And I have... Oh, alright.
[158:39.59]That's cool.
[158:48.53]Can I do rapid fire?
[158:49.29]This is the hardest shmup.
[159:02.66]That's enough.
[159:03.42]What do you know about odd shmups, dude?
[159:07.48]Alright, I'll go.
[159:21.38]Hit them back at them.
[159:22.28]Hit them back at them, please.
[159:23.58]You should play Touhou.
[159:35.14]It's harder.
[159:36.34]That's fine.
[159:43.31]Man, I can't move.
[159:53.44]What's that?
[159:54.92]Oh, super!
[159:57.18]Just spam!
[160:12.32]Alright, I'm good.
[160:13.28]Oh, I upgraded my bar.
[160:14.38]Cool.
[160:21.63]And... Ooh, what?
[160:22.73]Hit the guy underneath?
[160:23.63]What?
[160:32.34]What does it do when you slow down the bomb?
[160:33.88]Just explodes a bunch.
[160:35.62]Oh, that's nice.
[160:36.68]Ooh, get him.
[160:49.18]I'm getting too overconfident with that.
[160:52.11]Okay, that just almost instantly killed me.
[160:54.55]Oh my fucking lord.
[160:55.89]Are you serious?
[161:01.38]Okay, he's getting... He's getting kind of out of control.
[161:11.09]Okay, we're good.
[161:11.59]We're fine.
[161:11.87]We're fine.
[161:12.39]Hold on.
[161:17.90]Hit him.
[161:18.54]Good.
[161:18.80]Alright, bomb.
[161:21.46]Ah.
[161:22.18]Gah!
[161:23.94]What did you get for cheating to Ikaruga?
[161:27.00]What do you know about Ikaruga?
[161:31.85]Yo, he just walked out of the screen.
[161:33.53]Of course I can't hit him now.
[161:37.65]Alright, you're being a real dick.
[161:38.73]Like, come into the frame so I can shoot you.
[161:44.48]You're being a dick.
[161:47.57]Finally.
[161:57.20]Oh boy.
[161:58.88]Okay, we gotta go slow.
[162:00.76]Slow him down, slow him down, slow him down.
[162:02.78]We're gonna go like this.
[162:06.34]We should be able to get a bunch of them with a couple of bombs.
[162:12.21]Pretty sick.
[162:18.06]And... Not bad.
[162:26.79]What's he doing?
[162:28.67]More of this shit.
[162:29.47]That's fine.
[162:34.46]Can I just drop it on his head?
[162:36.24]Ooh, okay, I get it.
[162:44.84]Holy shit, that feels good.
[162:46.50]Okay, don't fucking blow it here.

[187:42.43]Turn the bomb thing off.
[187:43.95]I can't.
[187:44.41]It's part of the video game.
[187:46.43]Punch?
[187:50.79]Okay.
[187:54.64]Alright, I don't understand what the hell this one's doing.
[188:00.10]Why does it look like I'm not wearing my glasses?
[188:03.68]For effect.
[188:30.11]Yeah, that was... Okay.
[188:32.47]Alright. Alright.
[188:36.98]I wish the game looked like this this entire time.
[188:38.76]I really don't think you wish that.
[188:41.10]Thanks for making the screen dark.
[189:12.71]Die! Oh!
[189:23.85]Burger! Thank you.
[189:30.19]Nooo! I'm fine.
[189:47.66]Jerma, there's a bomb that needs to be disarmed.
[189:53.48]I know.
[189:53.91]Alright.
[189:57.63]I'm gonna put it in fucking C-mode only mode.
[190:21.24]Thank you.
[190:21.66]I only have 29?
[190:31.97]Well, I didn't need this, did I?
[190:33.05]I only have one more health before I am so dead.
[190:37.79]I hate these rooms.
[190:38.65]They're the worst.
[190:39.22]I don't like this level.
[190:40.38]Let's add this level and delete it.
[190:51.62]Alright, caught him in the air.
[191:00.14]I need to regenerate.
[191:04.63]Regenerate, regenerate, regenerate.
[191:09.91]There it is.
[191:11.85]There we go.
[191:13.27]Times two.
[191:14.65]Oh, let's knock him over there.
[191:15.89]Yep.
[191:22.69]Swing at me.
[191:23.45]Where'd he go?
[191:24.67]He's dead.
[191:26.81]Yes!
[191:27.43]Alright, 20,000.
[191:28.47]What do I need?
[191:29.29]I need 30,000.
[191:31.95]Shit.
[191:32.09]Don't miss any secrets.
[191:53.47]This bomb has been off for a solid 30 minutes.
[191:59.81]Yes, I know.
[192:00.41]I wish I could turn it off.
[192:03.59]But I can't.
[192:04.24]I'm stuck here.
[192:23.23]I love this game, but I didn't like it when sections like this were in it.
[192:26.32]Yeah, I think this is annoying, but it's still part of the video game.
[192:28.72]You still enjoy yourself.
[192:32.60]You don't want people in chat to think you don't like this game.
[192:35.26]Be careful.
[192:35.76]I don't want them to think I don't like it.
[192:48.26]I want this guy in Smash Brothers.
[192:49.54]You think I'm going to be like, water levels suck.
[192:52.50]No, I'm going to be like, that's water level 6!
[192:55.99]Oh my fucking god.
[193:01.33]I missed.
[193:03.27]Okay.
[193:07.85]Alright, this is where it gets a little embarrassing.
[193:12.39]Trying to rush it.
[193:13.37]I know you're trying to rush because... I know.
[193:16.07]I get it.
[193:17.15]Trust me, I'm there.
[193:18.46]I'm with you there.
[193:19.14]It's actually me that's here.
[193:22.61]And I did it again.
[193:23.57]And I'm just trying to get the fuck through this as fast as possible.
[193:27.52]Is Leon Kennedy going to be in Smash?
[193:36.78]No, he's not.
[193:38.42]Is Leon Kennedy in Smash?
[193:40.52]What just happened there?
[193:44.17]What just happened?
[193:46.53]He was on it.
[194:01.87]You know, we can move on with our fucking lives.
[194:22.19]Oh, I can't even see the fucking ticker up top is blocking the stew.
[194:26.66]Why does it have to be up here?
[194:27.78]What's the point?
[194:29.44]No, it's all right.
[194:30.64]It's okay.
[194:31.42]It's cool.
[194:32.42]It's all right.
[194:33.18]It's okay.
[194:34.12]It'd be beautiful.
[194:34.68]That's cool.
[194:38.12]I just took damage.
[194:38.90]I just got so mad that I just took fucking damage.
[195:01.31]Get me the fuck out of here.
[195:02.79]Give me this credit card.
[195:08.95]Holy shit.
[195:10.27]I did it.
[195:12.00]Don't worry guys, I did it.
[195:12.92]That was a pain in the ass.
[195:21.72]Now what?
[195:26.40]I gotta go back?
[195:33.01]Now go back.
[195:34.01]Of course.
[195:45.74]450 beautiful's good.
[195:54.10]Oops!
[195:55.83]We're fine.
[196:08.50]Pack it up.
[196:11.34]Finally, full health.
[196:12.16]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[196:14.69]Good.
[196:15.97]Don't.
[196:18.87]What do you mean, slow?
[196:21.21]Slow, I... What is it?
[196:29.54]Want me to hit it in there?
[196:48.23]Why are you telling me to go fast?
[196:56.48]No, the thing was telling me to go slow.
[197:10.54]But he's Omega LOL so bad.
[197:12.58]He wouldn't have done that.
[197:13.30]He doesn't even know what this game is.
[197:16.50]You came in here five minutes ago and you were like, I don't know what this is, but this guy's shocked.
[197:20.74]Yeah, you don't even know what this is.
[197:30.57]Don't make me laugh.
[197:40.13]I'm probably missing out on so many crunchies.
[197:45.91]This is a shitty Kirby game.
[197:47.11]Imagine having such a, such a poor attitude.
[197:52.06]That you think that.
[197:55.96]Such a bad attitude to have for beautiful Joe.
[197:59.64]Whoa.
[198:00.92]Okay.
[198:01.12]That was dumb.
[198:01.96]I agree with you.
[198:12.44]What does that have anything to do with Kirby?
[198:16.91]Only 24,000.
[198:17.11]Shit.
[198:17.41]What do I do?
[198:23.52]Should I get another life?
[198:24.96]No, it's I have to win.
[198:27.46]I probably should get the cheeseburgers to get full health.
[198:30.61]I can't do the VFX yet.
[198:31.81]They'll have 30,000.
[198:32.65]So I gotta wait.
[198:38.51]Should I get some health?
[198:40.49]Max health?
[198:41.81]No, I'm probably going to get health before the boss.
[198:45.37]Oh, I gotta be good.
[198:46.15]This is a boss.
[198:49.48]Take two?
[198:50.12]No.
[198:51.62]I can't.
[198:52.24]It's too much money.
[198:56.38]Beautiful Joe is a good game.
[198:57.40]It's just not a good Kirby game.
[199:00.26]I can agree with that.
[199:01.26]Alright, just play good.
[199:05.79]Play good.
[199:07.94]I'm just gonna try to play good.
[199:09.26]Just play good.
[199:10.02]Go.
[199:10.56]I'm gonna go.
[199:10.84]Here we go.
[199:12.66]Play good.
[199:16.82]This is the guy that goes, What are you doing over here?
[199:21.03]Yes, I swear to God.
[199:21.87]People are gonna be like, oh, that makes sense.
[199:25.01]Fuck.
[199:25.45]I think this guy's hard.
[199:30.79]This guy's scary from what I remember, too.
[199:32.52]He scared the shit out of me when I played this before.
[199:36.20]Because he goes like, ah!
[199:37.54]And he's...
[199:48.17]grand bruce wait wait wait that sub goes to your hideout
[200:13.65]No, never mind, okay?
[200:16.65]But yeah, you have to know, mate, we need that girl for our destiny planned to escape.
[200:25.33]Movie land.
[200:26.95]And rules.
[200:31.12]I think it actually does a Jaws theme song, too.
[200:33.01]It goes like...
[200:46.41]There we go.
[200:47.83]He throws up trash.
[200:50.14]That's a GameCube.
[201:20.48]Ooh.
[201:27.80]Oh, God.
[201:28.39]I can't... Get out, get out, get out!
[201:32.83]Get him off me!
[201:35.07]Now we're underwater.
[201:35.87]Fucking fantastic.
[201:42.28]Where is he?
[201:47.00]Oh.
[201:48.12]Ah!
[201:48.78]This is what I'm talking about!
[201:54.42]Oh, he... I get it!
[201:55.24]I get it!
[201:55.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[201:56.86]He grabs a bomb.
[202:02.74]Don't get too cocky on this guy.
[202:07.44]D'oh!
[202:08.64]Yep.
[202:15.83]It's so stressful!
[202:19.19]Where is he?
[202:28.54]Look for the bombs.
[202:34.24]Okay.
[202:35.02]Over here.
[202:36.26]He's gonna go... Did he get one?
[202:40.59]He got one.
[202:44.81]What?
[202:45.21]Oh.
[202:47.87]Alright.
[202:48.03]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[202:49.05]Down, down, down.
[202:53.61]He's so fast.
[203:01.47]I don't like it.
[203:02.85]Okay, wait, wait.
[203:03.35]Just kick him in the head once.
[203:06.49]Where'd he go?
[203:18.02]Where is he?
[203:19.62]Where'd he go?
[203:24.10]Oh shit.
[203:27.24]Where is he?
[203:28.42]There he is.
[203:32.67]Right here.
[203:36.73]He'll jump right into it.
[203:39.62]He got one.
[203:44.86]Shit.
[203:45.36]Back it up.
[203:46.06]Back it up.
[203:46.60]Back it up.
[203:47.12]Back it up.
[203:55.01]Oh, fuck.
[203:55.71]No, I jumped into it.
[203:56.61]I'm so mad.
[204:07.57]He's healing?
[204:08.46]Oh, fuck, he is healing.
[204:16.24]I gotta... Grab this one right in front of you.
[204:31.75]Oh, that's not good.
[204:41.09]I'm dead.
[204:42.33]Oh, god damn it.
[204:45.35]He sucks.
[204:46.97]This is the last chance.
[204:49.90]He heals on the water.
[204:50.72]I gotta get him out of the water?
[205:07.61]Oh my god, I'm trying to get the fuck away.
[205:12.17]Oh, this is bad.
[205:13.05]This is very, very, very bad.
[205:15.61]Right here.
[205:28.04]Grab it.
[205:30.10]Alright, get out of the water.
[205:43.39]Dude, holy shit!
[205:54.13]Where are they?
[205:56.61]Right here.
[205:57.00]Just go right into it.
[205:58.18]He's gonna go right into it.
[205:59.02]Run, two, three.
[205:59.96]Am I... What's going on?
[206:10.72]Huh?
[206:16.74]Oh my god, where the fuck is he?
[206:17.98]Get out of the water.
[206:27.84]Shit.
[206:28.76]Okay, I need a good one.
[206:29.58]I need one that's right in front of him.
[206:31.56]Why is he not doing it?
[206:32.18]Come on, dude.
[206:37.12]Do the... Alright, right here.
[206:43.14]What?
[206:43.38]He went a weird way!
[206:44.30]Oh!
[206:46.96]Wow, I thought he went a fucking wicked weird way!
[206:54.40]Jesus Christ.
[206:59.01]Good placement, Ryder.
[207:09.27]God damn it!
[207:18.26]Oh, I'm in.
[207:19.14]Oh, he's healing again.
[207:20.28]He's at full fucking health, guys.
[207:22.19]This is insane.
[207:25.53]Holy shit.
[207:30.55]He just regen to full health.
[208:02.22]Oh, come on.
[208:03.02]What is with this placement?
[208:14.39]Get out of the water.
[208:25.66]Where'd he go?
[208:26.64]Don't come with a fucking... Oh, come on.
[208:30.40]What the fuck?
[208:31.86]He's just regenning.
[208:33.76]What?
[208:35.40]I'm dead.
[208:36.98]The whole level has to happen again.
[208:42.17]Oh, this is painful.
[208:47.49]Oh, no.
[208:48.85]Wait!
[208:50.39]Hold on.
[208:54.07]Do I get to try from right there?
[208:59.62]Do I get to try from right there?
[209:00.72]Do I?
[209:08.30]I think I do.
[209:08.80]I think it's right there.
[209:21.73]Yes.
[209:22.99]Oh, this is beautiful.
[209:24.07]This is absolutely beautiful.
[209:25.35]I was about to be very mad.
[209:26.37]I'm not even mad.
[209:27.09]I'm excited.
[209:28.07]Phew.
[209:31.48]they actually give it to you.
[209:32.42]Because this guy's hard, man.
[209:34.16]They're going to make you do the whole level again.
[209:35.50]It's a hard game.
[209:45.85]I'm going to zoom in and do more kicks.
[209:48.39]I know.
[209:54.45]We do have to watch a bit.
[209:55.47]No, we don't.
[209:55.81]Alright, let's go.
[210:13.09]That's alright.
[210:13.69]It's okay.
[210:14.35]I got cocky for no reason.
[210:15.77]But here comes a... Look at that.
[210:33.76]Good start.
[210:34.44]Really good start.
[210:35.33]Oh, man.
[210:36.21]What's he doing down there?
[210:43.94]What the fuck's he doing down there?
[210:47.04]I'm right over here.
[210:48.08]Right in front of me.
[210:49.26]Right here!
[210:59.75]Oh shit!
[211:00.35]Oh shit!
[211:00.69]I don't even know what direction he's in!
[211:09.06]Is he regenning?
[211:16.07]He's gonna run into this one right here.
[211:21.71]Which one are they fucking going to?
[211:23.19]Which one?
[211:23.81]This one right here!
[211:27.71]Hello?
[211:36.41]Ah!
[211:36.75]Where?
[211:37.01]Where is it?
[211:37.66]Where is he?
[211:38.92]You... Come on!
[211:40.44]What the fuck?
[211:48.11]Give me that full one!
[211:49.25]Wah!
[211:59.92]No!
[212:01.96]Oh god, this guy sucks!
[212:04.50]He's so scary, it's fucking making me panic!
[212:19.15]Get the fuck off me!
[212:27.21]Little TNT!
[212:33.76]Jesus!
[212:34.66]Go!
[212:36.00]No!
[212:41.92]He's not gonna regen, right?
[212:50.01]Ay!
[212:51.07]Ay!
[212:51.41]Ay!
[212:51.63]Ay!
[212:52.35]Ay!
[213:01.09]God dammit!
[213:08.94]Where is it?
[213:09.54]Ah!
[213:09.60]Get the fuck outta here!
[213:24.22]Is he regenning?
[213:26.75]Nope.
[213:31.31]Oh my god, what happened out here?
[213:37.43]Holy shit!
[213:42.32]What the fuck is happening?
[213:43.76]Anybody know?
[213:47.90]No!
[213:50.86]No, no, no!
[214:15.74]Okay, now get the fuck out.
[214:21.66]Where'd he go?
[214:26.06]Oh, shit, man.
[214:26.80]Here we go.
[214:29.76]Stay right here.
[214:31.48]Oh, please just don't hit me.
[214:41.24]Get the fuck out.
[214:42.34]Get the fuck out.
[214:43.00]Get the fuck out.
[214:43.64]Get the fuck out.
[214:44.16]He's gonna get me.
[214:45.28]Shh.
[214:57.59]Gah.
[215:11.97]Get the fuck away from me, sir!
[215:14.78]Don't you regen.
[215:16.06]Don't be a fucking asshole about this.
[215:18.30]Oh, you can't be serious.
[215:21.70]Don't move.
[215:22.18]He's gonna hit the one right fucking here.
[215:27.00]I am excruciatingly upset by that.
[215:31.16]I thought he was gonna get the hitbox.
[215:41.70]Oh my god dammit, this is fucking STOOOP!
[215:52.49]This is RNG fucking bullshit!
[215:59.43]Did I not hit-
[216:18.17]Where the fuck did he go?
[216:19.95]Oops, get out.
[216:26.60]Give me a good RNG.
[216:29.68]That's not what I wanted.
[216:34.86]It's good, good, good.
[216:49.38]Oh no, he's gonna ram me!
[216:52.16]I gotta stop.
[217:01.59]Get out of the zoom in.
[217:18.03]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[217:20.79]He's panicking and there's nothing he can do about it!
[217:24.23]He's about to be in deep shit!
[217:25.99]He's about to be in deep shit!
[217:28.32]Hey!
[217:51.28]I can't even speak.
[217:53.04]It's too scary.
[217:57.22]Okay, we're still in this one.
[218:24.96]I'm still in this!
[218:25.82]You put a bomb next to me, man!
[218:46.10]Hello?
[218:46.76]Where is it?
[219:08.97]Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[219:10.97]It is a guy!
[219:12.45]Okay, I gotta make... This is more... Get the fuck out of my life.
[219:20.84]That was horrible.
[219:25.40]I didn't even have any words.
[219:26.92]I couldn't even speak.
[219:27.93]That was fucking hard as shit.
[219:29.01]That was insane.
[219:29.71]My whole body is, like, on fire right now.
[219:34.71]That was fucking hard as shit.
[219:36.17]What was the last part?
[219:37.61]Uh, what did I just say?
[219:40.42]Uh, I said... This guy's coming after me.
[219:42.46]I only have to hit him two or three more times and I win.
[219:46.46]And what good RNG placement.
[219:47.46]I think that's what I said.
[220:03.09]Will this trail eventually lead to Sylvia?
[220:05.83]Will the ship become the next Noah's Ark for Joe?
[220:08.99]Or will he become the next bait for Moby Dick?
[220:12.39]To find out, don't miss the next installment of Beautiful Joe, The Beautiful Escape.
[220:19.44]Oh, that guy was horrible.
[220:22.60]Oh, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.
[220:31.12]And it's a save point.
[220:32.22]Ugh.
[220:33.99]Praise be to the light.
[220:41.21]You're bad.
[220:41.83]That's fine.
[220:45.15]That's fine.
[220:45.69]That's okay.
[220:47.43]I'm playing on the fucking hard mode, dude.
[220:56.35]Nevermind, I'm grounded because you said dick.
[221:00.77]Well then, get out of here.
[221:04.44]You're gonna get in even more trouble.
[221:06.42]You're gonna get in so... You're gonna get in trouble again.
[221:09.08]Alright, VFX turbocharger.
[221:12.82]Got it.
[221:13.48]Yes.
[221:17.87]All the money we have.
[221:21.35]That's rude.
[221:23.97]No, it's just realistic.
[221:26.85]That curtain comes up and it's Mario 3.
[221:46.31]The beautiful escape.
[222:11.83]Wow, that's a... a missile coming out Can I get up there?
[222:25.93]No.
[222:27.17]Missile incoming
[222:31.01]Nice dodge nice dog.
[222:32.73]That was pretty good Can you the buttons can either Oh, bye-bye Another one coming.
[222:54.80]Oh shit floor guide
[222:58.69]Bridge, machinery room, engine room.
[223:01.19]Be careful for dangerous stuff.
[223:03.81]Alright, so we gotta go up into the engine room.
[223:05.35]We gotta go up into the bridge.
[223:12.84]Yeah.
[223:14.06]Okay, that was a little odd, but whatever.
[223:19.62]Where did it put me?
[223:22.70]Okay, I'm confused right now.
[223:23.88]I just got knocked off around the whole level.
[223:32.55]Alright, let's go.
[223:34.77]Up to the engine room.
[223:35.69]Well, we gotta go down.
[223:37.30]Okay.
[223:38.24]I think I can bring that other thing with me now.
[223:42.36]There's one back here, right?
[223:46.10]Oh, shit.
[223:48.44]Oh.
[223:49.10]There's some toys.
[223:52.29]Ah, there we go.
[223:56.39]I want to get hit by this.
[224:03.74]Oh, wait.
[224:03.94]Do I have to protect it?
[224:04.94]I didn't even see what happened to it.
[224:05.76]Oh, shit.
[224:05.92]Okay, I have to bring it down with me.
[224:06.68]Okay, let's go.
[224:24.77]Come here. Come here.
[224:24.97]Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[224:25.19]Down down down down.
[224:36.72]Alright, now we gotta go up.
[224:41.44]Whaaaat?
[224:47.48]Oh, come on, man.
[224:53.26]Oh, this is sad.
[224:54.16]I kinda wanna just die and then continue because having one health here is bogus.
[225:02.93]I would consider this to be pretty bogus, you know what I mean?
[225:20.65]I get hit once and I'm dead.
[225:21.73]Hopefully there's food up here.
[225:27.06]Oh, you fucking blew it.
[225:30.69]Come on.
[225:32.03]Come on!
[225:32.99]Come on!
[225:43.46]Oh, you gotta get on.
[225:44.24]What the fuck?
[225:46.02]What the fuck?
[225:47.66]Why was I going through it?
[225:49.77]Why did it go back?
[225:53.01]What?
[225:53.61]What?
[225:55.87]What?
[225:56.87]I, huh?
[225:59.25]No.
[226:01.81]Uh, I, that's bad July right there.
[226:04.79]I don't, I don't, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I want a better shot at this.
[226:10.67]Just kill me.
[226:11.99]I gotta get up.
[226:12.83]This is the beginning of the level.
[226:13.77]I can't be down one health, one continue already.
[226:18.71]That'd be bad.
[226:21.09]Just kill me.
[226:26.55]Look, I got no clothes on.
[226:27.99]Attack me.
[226:30.47]I got no suit on, whatever.
[226:31.75]You take double damage, right?
[226:33.29]Alright, this is it.
[226:47.00]Kill me.
[226:49.10]Kill me.
[226:49.64]Kill me.
[226:50.18]Kill me.
[226:50.67]Kill me.
[226:51.87]Kill me.
[226:54.17]Kill me.
[226:55.47]Kill me.
[226:57.11]Ow.
[226:59.01]Kill me.
[227:00.51]Kill me.
[227:03.66]Kill me.
[227:05.70]Kill me.
[227:06.10]Kill me.
[227:06.50]Kill me.
[227:06.84]Kill me.
[227:07.24]Kill me.
[227:07.60]Kill me.
[227:09.34]Oh!
[227:10.28]Oh!
[227:11.04]Oh!
[227:12.00]Oh, I can do that myself.
[227:13.00]Why do I... I could have just gone... No!
[227:21.48]Why do I have to pretend?
[227:23.56]Go!
[227:31.28]Fucking crunch, man.
[227:33.29]It's killing me.
[228:07.50]All right, I'm gonna get hit in hell.
[228:36.51]The audio is muted.
[228:38.01]Oh, shit!
[228:42.54]Something's fucking wrong with me tonight.
[228:46.44]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[228:47.90]Yeah, I'm fucking... I'm losing my fucking mind.
[228:53.81]We're gonna get Bugleberry?
[228:54.93]Well, I don't mean... It's funny that you say that.
[228:59.21]It's funny that you say that.
[229:01.17]It's funny that you say that.
[229:02.46]Because you're a hero.
[229:09.40]Alright, let me get to a save point, and then I'm gonna go to- I'm gonna get up and move around.
[229:13.54]Remember, those of you that don't know, the new German NA5 streaming schedule is four to five hours a week.
[229:20.16]No, that's not it.
[229:21.89]That would be fucking terrible.
[229:23.89]That would mean not even streaming.
[229:25.55]That's four to five hours.
[229:29.97]Four to five hours a week.
[229:32.50]Oh, boy.
[229:33.10]Well...
[229:45.07]It takes me more time to brush my teeth, take a shower, and take a shit than a four hour a week.
[229:51.25]How long do you think it takes a week to take a shower, brush your teeth, and take a shit a week?
[229:57.50]I'm going to say it's probably like...
[230:02.99]what is about ten minutes in the shower like five to ten minutes in the shower two to four minutes to brush your teeth and then about 15 to 45 minutes depending on what you ate last night okay I'm getting hit too much so you're talking about like an hour what like 15
[230:26.76]15 minutes, 30... What about like an hour and 20 minutes a day?
[230:31.13]You're only like taking a shit and like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.
[230:34.71]Yeah.
[230:35.47]So that would be... Yeah.
[230:37.09]That makes sense.
[230:37.99]What do you eat?
[230:38.89]Well, sometimes you just want to hang out in there.
[230:54.86]People that say that... No, you guys know.
[230:57.98]You know my stance on this already.
[230:59.78]Anybody right now that's saying, like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[231:02.32]No.
[231:03.28]It's okay.
[231:03.72]You can pretend on the internet.
[231:05.86]It makes sense.
[231:06.69]Like, you can pretend on the internet.
[231:08.55]You can be anybody on the internet right now.
[231:15.19]But all of us here know.
[231:17.29]We don't have to... We know.
[231:19.62]I know that there might be, like... There might be, like...
[231:22.42]I don't know.
[231:22.78]You might be trying... Hold on.
[231:24.02]I can't fuck this up.
[231:24.76]Give me a second.
[231:25.22]Alright.
[231:30.04]What were you saying?
[231:34.93]Why is Jerma beating up toaster sprudels?
[231:38.93]Toaster sprudels?
[231:41.61]Oh, they look like toaster sprudels?
[231:44.21]What?
[231:50.50]I don't want to screw this up again.
[231:52.52]Where's the bomb?
[231:54.06]What's the thing?
[231:54.74]Bob-omb-bill?
[232:00.96]I know what it is!
[232:01.98]Get down here.
[232:14.57]Bob-omb-bomb-bill, right?
[232:17.17]Bullet-bill.
[232:21.41]Okay, and excuse me.
[232:23.35]Excuse me.
[232:23.89]Why?
[232:24.65]Excuse me.
[232:26.59]What is going on here?
[232:28.15]Why can I not get on this?
[232:29.09]Excuse me.
[232:34.30]Excuse me.
[232:36.52]Excuse me.
[232:56.90]Wasn't it just... Wasn't it there?
[232:58.34]It was right here.
[233:03.13]The fan... Yeah, the thing was right here.
[233:05.45]I have to drop it down into the fan?
[233:08.99]Oh, this is bogus.
[233:13.46]Call this a monumental pain in the fucking balls, is what we call this.
[233:19.68]Okay, come on.
[233:40.29]I mean, I'm not gonna miss those.
[233:46.29]No crack stream today, guys.
[233:47.61]That was me two hours ago.
[233:49.57]I'm not sure there's a stream that happens now that's not a crack stream.
[233:52.71]You know what I'm saying?
[233:53.39]I think we've gone too far.
[233:54.33]I think we're past the point of no return.
[233:58.22]I mean, at this point, like, I open up chat and, like, people... I see... I just see wild, wild shit.
[234:09.79]Finally.
[234:15.85]I see the most wild shit.
[234:19.70]Stuff that I would never even repeat out loud.
[234:22.88]For instance, did the shrinking curse work on your penis?
[234:28.63]Right?
[234:29.37]Like... You want me to say that?
[234:41.36]Uh, I'll tell you.
[234:41.96]I was... So... It's not gonna happen, because it's just... I think it's a little too... It might be a little too much for... For her, because, I mean, she... Like, she has... She's like, that's not what her Twitter is for.
[234:58.86]But I asked Kim if she would write...
[235:03.14]Hey, I don't know what the fuck's going on, but Jeremy's dick is way smaller.
[235:07.26]And, like, it was kind of there.
[235:10.04]Like, it was there.
[235:11.50]Maybe.
[235:14.48]But that's, like, I think that might be too much.
[235:18.88]Maybe.
[235:19.10]Alright, what the hell is...
[235:26.26]Because of all the curse stuff, I thought it might be funny.
[235:29.12]But then it's like, who actually would think that was funny?
[235:31.94]I don't know.
[235:37.36]She was like, yeah, I'll do it.
[235:39.44]And I'm just like, yeah.
[235:42.42]You could.
[235:43.18]Yeah.
[235:43.65]And then I was like, eh, maybe you shouldn't.
[235:46.15]Maybe you shouldn't.
[235:58.36]Three, two, one.
[236:05.26]Wait a minute.
[236:07.00]All right, cool.
[236:28.84]Just go for it!
[236:31.46]Forehead!
[236:36.54]What's the boss of this one?
[236:37.86]Uh-oh, new enemy!
[236:48.03]What's this new enemy do?
[236:54.49]Cut, cut, cut!
[237:05.13]Well, how am I supposed to know what this new enemy does?
[237:07.71]Does anyone know where I am?
[237:11.64]How am I supposed to know what the new enemy does?
[237:20.90]If you don't do a song, I won't give any bits.
[237:23.86]It's okay.
[237:25.11]Take care of you.
[237:25.99]Give yourself some money.
[237:28.05]Hey, keep your money.
[237:28.63]All right?
[237:29.45]Keep it.
[237:29.67]It's yours.
[237:30.53]Give that money to me.
[237:32.15]What the fuck?
[237:38.41]Jeez, man.
[237:42.48]Gotta hit him in the bum?
[237:44.66]Oh, wait.
[237:45.18]Now he's a different character.
[237:49.47]You gotta hit him in the space wheel?
[237:54.42]I'm not sure what hit him in the space wheel means.
[238:05.00]No, I need those.
[238:13.05]Ooh, little TNT!
[238:17.07]Ah!
[238:18.50]Ah!
[238:19.68]Little TNT!
[238:22.78]Little TNT!
[238:30.42]Kane!
[238:31.94]He's your brother, Kane!
[238:33.32]I'm gonna do it really loud.
[238:38.98]Ka- Ka- Hold on.
[238:42.46]Ka- Kane!
[238:46.54]He's your brother, Kane!
[238:49.82]Got it.
[239:10.01]I see... You missed one?
[239:11.45]It's alright.
[239:13.09]I see the evil in your eyes!
[239:16.75]And you know...
[239:18.91]My Undertaker will destroy!
[239:21.62]I don't want, like, this, like, I'll fucking probably, I'll, this, I don't know.
[239:25.71]I'm about to do this.
[239:29.13]Hey, we got a save point.
[239:29.99]You know what that means.
[239:31.54]Bye.
[239:39.12]What am I going to do with OnlyFans?
[239:40.14]I'm not going to do an OnlyFans account.
[239:42.95]This channel has like 6,500 subs right now.
[239:46.37]Why would I ever do an OnlyFans?
[239:48.83]What the hell would I do that for?
[239:51.41]This channel has over 6,500 subscriptions.
[239:56.31]Would there be a reason for me to open an OnlyFans?
[240:02.41]That's for your fans.
[240:09.89]What?
[240:12.27]He's bragging.
[240:13.31]No, I'm telling you that there's no... Why would I have another place for you to... Hey, you know, I have... There's a shitload of you that sub to this channel.
[240:21.60]And there's like thousands of you.
[240:23.12]Hey, all of you do that again over here this time.
[240:26.62]But keep the Twitch one going too.
[240:28.24]You don't do two.
[240:29.64]I want like three Netflix subscriptions of you subscribing and fanning to me on four different websites.
[240:40.22]Oh, by the way, on one of these websites, you're paying like $5, $10 a month.
[240:46.24]And maybe I'll do a Facebook post every maybe two or three weeks.
[240:51.50]And then maybe I'll do a video for like two minutes going, Hey, what's up, my supporters?
[241:01.84]Thanks.
[241:03.08]Thanks for triple dipping.
[241:07.40]How does he not know?
[241:08.32]What?
[241:13.07]It's not like a Patreon.
[241:19.64]What is it?
[241:19.96]How do you have a website called OnlyFans?
[241:24.14]And it's not like a fans like... Sign up to make money and interact with your fans.
[241:37.31]That's what the tagline is.
[241:41.39]This is OnlyFans.
[241:43.16]Sign up to make money and interact with your fans.
[241:49.14]How it works.
[241:52.16]Look, this is just like a person on camera.
[241:55.49]Anyone can earn.
[241:56.73]As far as we're concerned, if you use one's social media and produce your own content, you should be using OnlyFans, right?
[242:02.05]Whether you're uploading tutorials, tips, behind-the-scenes footage, or endless selfies, right?
[242:07.58]That's what this...
[242:12.59]What are you guys talking about?
[242:18.23]Number of followers.
[242:20.09]Okay, how many followers do I have?
[242:23.96]I have 200.
[242:24.98]Let's just round it up to 300,000.
[242:26.64]Okay, how many number of followers?
[242:28.58]No, number of followers?
[242:29.24]Okay.
[242:30.32]My monthly subscription price is $15 a month.
[242:33.04]That's fucking outrageous.
[242:37.24]You could earn between $45,000 and $225,000 per month.
[242:39.20]What?
[242:39.30]Hold on, wait a minute.
[242:40.00]Wait, you could earn $200,000 a month based on an estimate between 1% and 5% of your followers subscribing.
[242:46.60]That's not going to be accurate.
[243:02.10]Is this, hold on, this is saying that if I have 300,000 followers, that between 30 and 40,000 will subscribe.
[243:09.64]That's not accurate.
[243:11.67]It's more like 0.2 or something.
[243:15.19]And it would be, no, this is inaccurate.
[243:17.21]It would be like $5, it would be $5 a month.
[243:18.39]And I only have 100,000 Twitter followers.
[243:19.31]So you would earn between $4,900 and $24,000 a month.
[243:22.11]That's a lot of money.
[243:35.59]Shitload of money.
[243:36.97]No, when I say only, I mean only fans.
[243:41.68]I didn't say the fans part afterwards.
[243:46.90]Only feet.
[243:50.36]It's porn.
[243:51.64]It doesn't look like it from here.
[243:53.30]It doesn't look like it from here.
[243:54.76]This is...
[244:04.49]OnlyFans porn videos.
[244:06.72]No, there's no porn videos.
[244:10.90]Oh, maybe it is.
[244:14.46]OnlyFans has put X-rated entertainment in the hands of the entertainers.
[244:17.98]The paywall of porn.
[244:19.58]Oh.
[244:21.12]Yeah, but can't you do... Hold on a second.
[244:22.48]But can't you do... Like, if you have a Patreon, can't you do like a... Can you do like a... Is this porn not allowed on Patreon?
[244:29.14]Can you do like a porn Patreon?
[244:30.38]Patreon porn?
[244:32.18]Can you do like a porn... So what's the difference?
[244:39.68]It's not, it is, it's all, it's allowed.
[244:45.13]Oops, I just, that's a Pornhub link.
[244:47.61]I can't, I, it's not opening, right?
[244:49.87]Close everything.
[244:50.91]Alt F4 every fucking thing.
[244:51.91]I'll turn the stream off.
[244:52.61]Alright, that was a Pornhub link, the first one.
[244:56.00]So, uh, I'm not gonna, I clicked it, but I immediately X'd out.
[245:07.25]Because you're going to make $200,000 a month?
[245:14.04]That's like retire.
[245:18.52]That's like retire in six months money.
[245:25.61]If you're making $300,000 a month for like a year, that's literally you're done forever.
[245:31.49]And it's tax-free.
[245:35.76]That's horseshit.
[245:39.26]There's no such thing as tax-free, okay?
[245:44.73]Let me just be honest with you.
[245:45.71]If I make double that, I make $400,000 a month.
[245:55.71]If I made $400,000 a month, I would have already reached out to fucking Danny DeVito's agent.
[246:03.30]And he would have streamed in my place.
[246:06.01]With, like, makeup on to look like me.
[246:09.07]Are you fucking serious?
[246:09.83]You really think I wouldn't do that?
[246:10.91]Are you kidding me?
[246:12.21]If I made, like, half a million dollars a month, I would make... I would hire a hundred clowns just to fucking sit in the room silent with me.
[246:20.54]Like, for a week straight.
[246:22.48]And I would never address them.
[246:24.88]You guys... I'm dead.
[246:31.85]Wait, what just happened?
[246:40.76]What's wrong with me?
[246:43.58]What the hell's going on here?
[246:47.04]Did I?
[246:48.46]Wait.
[246:48.63]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[246:51.77]I'm gonna hold you to that when you really, really make it big.
[246:54.35]Oh, what the f- It's knocking me back into the other part of the level.
[246:59.63]The stream potential.
[247:05.67]The jerk has plans.
[247:07.97]What else would I do?
[247:17.28]Okay, we're fine.
[247:20.05]What does this want me to do?
[247:22.17]What else would I do?
[247:22.83]I mean, I'm full of fucking stupid ideas.
[247:27.27]I know that that's like a... You hear a lot of them, but there's stuff that I've really always wanted to do.
[247:33.53]But I mean, who knows.
[247:36.63]No, come down.
[247:42.68]If money was no object, what's the most out there idea?
[247:45.86]Well, I really, really, really, really want to do another live-action German Rumble.
[247:52.48]But I want it to be... I want it to be, like, actually live.
[248:00.18]Like, on Twitch.
[248:03.73]And I want a bunch of crazy shit to happen on that stream.
[248:07.13]I want it live on Twitch, not like a video.
[248:16.13]Come on, I'm trying to fucking make this happen.
[248:21.73]I'm dead.
[248:22.03]Oh my god, am I dead?
[248:23.59]I'm dead.
[248:25.97]I'm not, I'm alive.
[248:26.79]I'm good.
[248:27.57]I'm alive.
[248:28.43]I really want to see you.
[248:35.55]here's something that's actually kind of funny germa rumble live action 2 is already written already it's already done it just has to be made that's a secret that I've held on to for probably a couple like a year and a half it's already written the whole thing whole thing's done everything is there
[248:57.37]The only thing that would need to change is some characters that may have been more relevant like a year and a half ago would have to just be replaced.
[249:04.22]But there's stuff in there that hopefully, if I ever had like an opportunity... What the fuck?
[249:12.43]If I ever had the opportunity, it would be a lot of fun.
[249:27.50]I have an only chance to hunt it.
[249:28.90]Well, it's not even necessarily... There's, like, other options, too, and... It's not, because... Alright.
[249:41.18]The Carnival.
[249:43.87]The carnival was just like a fun thing to do and something I really, really wanted to do.
[249:48.43]And it was a ton of fun.
[249:49.37]I had blast doing it.
[249:50.23]I had a ton of fun making it and it was a blast.
[249:54.02]And that was, I paid for the whole thing.
[249:57.42]There was no sponsor.
[249:58.32]There was no outside help.
[249:59.96]It was literally just, I just was like, here, it's just a bunch of money.
[250:04.62]Okay, do it.
[250:07.03]If there was someone, like a sponsor or something, and we've talked about it before, the guys that did Carnival, we've had a lot of conversations about this.
[250:16.33]If it was possible, maybe that would be an avenue.
[250:21.62]Maybe having somebody that could pony up a ton more money to do something crazy like that.
[250:28.66]I don't have to make $500,000 a month to do German Rumble Live 2 the way that I want it.
[250:37.18]It would just have to make sense.
[250:38.22]And it would have to be something that I didn't... I never wanted to get to a point where I take money on this stream for fun just because it's there.
[250:47.93]Like, the reason to do a sponsored stream like that would be solely to make it actually happen.
[250:57.77]It wouldn't be for really any other reason.
[251:02.65]I gotta go down?
[251:08.14]It's not going to happen, is it?
[251:14.00]How do I do this?
[251:18.23]It's going to crush me!
[251:21.17]What?
[251:26.21]I can't move.
[251:30.40]Do I have the right idea?
[251:33.02]What if you sold tickets?
[251:34.52]No, I would want it to be free.
[251:36.06]I want people to watch it and not to pay for it.
[251:38.28]Like pay-per-view.
[251:40.20]No, that's too much.
[251:41.16]That's too far.
[251:42.18]I wouldn't want to do that.
[251:43.48]How can I not do this?
[251:51.10]I can jump through that.
[252:03.55]contact yeah this we'll see I think it's just to see it live would be fine yeah but the thing about venues like that you just have to remember it
[252:22.82]It would have to be wherever it was filmed.
[252:26.50]It would have to be, you know, obviously protected and safe from anyone just kind of coming in and just, hey, I'm here.
[252:33.97]I'm on the stream now.
[252:36.30]So having like a private venue is probably better.
[252:41.62]Especially if it's like a scripted event.
[252:43.75]I gotta make sure the right shit is done and the right people are involved.
[252:46.49]Because if it's just like, oh hey guys, by the way, we're at this venue.
[252:49.77]Welcome everybody to Gerber Rebel Live Twitch Edition.
[252:53.25]Oh, and there's five cars that just pulled up and there are just people are coming in.
[252:57.94]People are knocking on the door.
[253:10.17]Oh, he can punch that.
[253:12.52]Guys, he can punch that.
[253:23.17]Guys, he can punch that thing.
[253:45.64]But that's another thing, like fuuuck.
[253:50.03]Funding for a fuck.
[254:06.03]Fuuuuuck.
[254:16.52]Fuck.
[254:21.22]Okay.
[254:24.52]Okay.
[254:24.82]Alright.
[254:25.58]Okay.
[254:26.02]That's it.
[254:27.14]I'm done.
[254:27.40]See you tomorrow.
[254:30.36]Alright.
[254:30.60]That's it.
[254:31.34]We'll call it here.
[254:32.26]See you tomorrow.
[254:35.00]Pay $500 to don't read that out loud because it's outrageous.
[254:39.06]So.
[254:40.34]Are we going to fund this?
[254:41.45]No.
[254:42.07]What I was going to say is I don't want to have
[254:47.32]A large stream would be the sole responsibility for you guys to pay for it.
[254:55.29]Hey, I can't wait to do it.
[254:56.85]I'm going to hype you guys up.
[254:57.81]I just need $125,000, guys.
[254:58.35]No.
[254:58.41]I need like $75,000, everybody.
[254:59.70]Come on, let's go.
[255:00.26]I don't want to do that.
[255:16.26]We have a number now.
[255:18.99]No, that's not even accurate.
[255:21.59]Not even accurate.
[255:27.49]Because I would want... Obviously, if you can get a sponsor to cover a majority of that, that's a big deal.
[255:38.64]It's going to be more than that.
[255:40.16]Maybe.
[255:42.52]The shit that I want to have happen on that stream is like...
[255:47.12]that they're gonna have to let's just put it this way it's gonna have to be uh four or five different units on set for that so but there's other things that are being worked on just I don't I'm not talking about them because why talk about something unless it's ready to go or makes any sense or is real what kind of unit well I mean
[256:17.88]I thought I was going to do it.
[256:18.66]Nope.
[256:23.10]But, yeah, we'll call it here.
[256:25.38]Did I even explain what the new schedule was before?
[256:27.96]I feel like I started halfway and then I just gave up.
[256:30.14]And, like, somebody called me stupid and I, like, yelled at them.
[256:32.25]What happened?
[256:32.93]Did I even explain it to anybody?
[256:37.35]Alright, so.
[256:39.45]What this channel's been used to has been about three days a week for six to eight hours.
[256:46.07]Changing it.
[256:47.52]because of my medical problems, it's better for me to do this in small doses, but I'm going to do it more times a week.
[256:57.19]So instead of three to four times a week, we're going to go four or five times a week for about four to five hours of stream.
[257:03.35]That's the plan.
[257:06.65]So the streams will be shorter, but there will be at least one more day.
[257:11.16]So it'll actually turn out to be probably around the same time streamed, but just spread out a little more.
[257:21.60]but yeah he has a yes make him shorter but funnier I mean I just I don't have any I don't know how I can't how you do that shorter but funnier is that even I don't know how do I how
[257:48.85]Just be, you have to be funny.
[257:51.52]All right.
[257:54.76]Contrary to popular belief here, there is no plan when I turn a story.
[257:59.76]Guys, I'm not just like, okay, I've got these 200 jokes ready.
[258:04.18]I've got, they're all lined up in front of me on six pieces of paper.
[258:07.26]I'm going to go bullet to bullet.
[258:09.62]This kind of, this kind of shit just kind of happens.
[258:14.12]Show the joke list.
[258:21.92]You have to break a leg.
[258:24.12]Use the sneeze macro.
[258:25.28]It's gone.
[258:26.00]This thing had to be unplugged and like I deleted shit.
[258:31.07]Leak the joke list.
[258:36.25]Maybe I should start writing stuff down.
[258:38.25]Well, I do have a lot of stuff written down.
[258:39.91]Would you like to see?
[258:40.71]Would you like to hear what some of the ideas are written down that are going to happen in the next probably month or so?
[258:44.80]I'll read them to you.
[258:46.32]Streams.
[258:47.46]Here we go.
[258:50.10]I'll read a couple to you.
[258:53.64]Let's see if I remember what any of these are.
[258:56.92]Green screen DLC.
[258:57.94]Obviously, that's still going to happen.
[259:01.50]The iPad stream.
[259:04.16]The iPad stream.
[259:05.95]Somebody had this interesting concept where you go to YouTube on iPad and click on every ad that's for a video game, download it, and play it for 20 minutes.
[259:15.85]And just do that.
[259:16.63]Continue to do it.
[259:19.15]I'm going to need a fucking new iPad after that, but you know.
[259:23.66]That was one of the things to do.
[259:29.25]Like almost just mobile game ads, click up and download them.
[259:32.43]But then I'm going to get like tracked for life.
[259:34.69]So that one hasn't happened yet.
[259:37.53]Uh, the easy bake oven stream is still on the, on the plants here.
[259:41.83]Just have to buy a few more things for it, but that's going to happen sooner rather than later.
[259:47.60]Oh, another one that's going to happen soon.
[259:49.84]Um,
[259:53.98]I was gonna get a bunch of those old kids board games, like Slobberin' Sam and, like, Mousetrap, and just get, like, two dozen of them and just try to play them.
[260:05.81]And, like, over, like, a two stream period.
[260:07.07]I was thinking about maybe even seeing if other, like, people might want to do that.
[260:11.59]Get, like, four or five people to try to play these stupid shitty games from, like, 1995.
[260:15.14]That's another one that's coming up, probably.
[260:18.42]What else we got?
[260:20.34]We got Mad World for the Wii.
[260:21.58]That's written here for some reason.
[260:25.11]That's here.
[260:31.27]Monster Lab for the Wii.
[260:32.33]We can go ahead and delete that one.
[260:35.21]What else is on here?
[260:35.95]Deadly Creatures.
[260:36.67]We can delete that one.
[260:37.45]The Bachelor for the Wii.
[260:38.66]Delete that one.
[260:39.22]That one's gone.
[260:41.36]Mario Sunshine.
[260:42.12]I haven't updated this in at least a couple weeks, as you can see, but I've been busy.
[260:47.76]Def Jam Fight for New York is on here, but I don't have it.
[260:51.28]Okay.
[260:54.27]I gotta get it.
[260:58.77]Dead Rising 3 is on here.
[261:01.51]Oh, City Skylines played that one.
[261:04.21]Oh, Mugen!
[261:05.03]Mugen Insanity!
[261:06.00]Right, this is bringing back some more ideas.
[261:08.60]I was going to download every single fucking character in Mugen.
[261:11.64]Every single one.
[261:13.38]And play... And try to play through it.
[261:17.92]Like, just pick a random character and play.
[261:23.43]And see how far I can get with each character.
[261:30.42]That's probably a terabyte of space.
[261:34.99]That's a hundred terabytes.
[261:36.37]Are you serious?
[261:38.31]Some characters have viruses, but what if I just get another computer?
[261:42.57]Like, can I use like an old laptop or something or an old like desktop and just get a one, like two terabyte drive?
[261:49.58]And that's just the Mugen computer.
[261:53.00]And like, even if it gets a bunch of viruses, who cares?
[261:58.07]That's money.
[261:58.61]No, I'm talking about like an old computer.
[262:00.25]I'm not gonna go buy- I'm not gonna go buy a computer to break it with Mugen viruses.
[262:04.97]What?
[262:05.69]It would be a Mugen computer.
[262:08.38]And I would just pull the video through a feed.
[262:11.56]Through the... I said the thing about Elgato being the worst thing ever, right?
[262:15.66]Fuck.
[262:17.10]I feel like I've said that like ten times.
[262:18.52]That was like the worst piece of hardware you could ever buy.
[262:21.43]And that's like not even true.
[262:28.04]That's 100 terabytes.
[262:33.17]How many characters are every character in Mugen?
[262:36.85]Like 50,000?
[262:44.09]How many characters are in Mugen?
[262:48.12]There's more than 50,000 characters.
[262:49.34]What?
[262:58.64]People are still... Yeah, that's crazy.
[263:00.60]Well, I'll get the ones that don't have viruses.
[263:02.81]I'll get ones that are verified.
[263:05.55]Drew Crew is on here.
[263:06.55]Let's go ahead and delete that one.
[263:13.75]The Cooking Simulator Food Network update is on here.
[263:16.81]Did that come out yet?
[263:23.43]Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse.
[263:24.95]That's another one.
[263:33.47]What is it?
[263:34.05]What is it?
[263:34.65]UFC 3.
[263:36.85]What is UFC 3?
[263:37.85]Oh, this reminds me.
[263:41.83]I gotta get that Olympics game.
[263:44.65]That's gonna be a... That stream is gonna be fucking nuts.
[263:48.61]That... Just like the 2012, like, London Olympics or whatever game.
[263:54.24]I'm gonna... I'm gonna destroy that game.
[264:00.60]Am I ever gonna play Doom?
[264:03.65]There are, like, new games that I have to play.
[264:05.65]I really have to try.
[264:06.67]I gotta do at least one, like, AAA game that's not Animal Crossing.
[264:10.67]Animal Crossing is the only new game in 2018 to 2020 besides... What was it, uh... Outer Wilds and Animal Crossing are the only two games I've played that have come out within the last two years and the last, like, four months.
[264:30.02]Oh, Mario and Sonic are the Olympic games.
[264:31.46]That's another one.
[264:32.45]I got a lot of shit here.
[264:33.23]And there's other things that are on here that I'm not going to say out loud because, whoa, they're, whoa.
[264:38.70]Whoa, they're big deals.
[264:39.78]Whoa, don't want to get your hopes up on these, but big deals coming up here.
[264:43.20]Wow.
[264:43.44]I'm going to go ahead and delete these because they're not going to, these are bad.
[264:54.34]Spoiler, leak one.
[264:55.45]I'm not going to leak one.
[264:56.73]No, it'll just happen.
[264:57.79]You'll see it.
[264:59.94]Tell us.
[265:00.30]Tell us.
[265:00.72]Nope.
[265:01.04]Nope.
[265:01.32]Nope.
[265:01.68]Easy bake oven.
[265:02.62]I'm gonna make a bunch of fucking child-sized cupcakes and shit.
[265:07.20]There you go.
[265:08.65]That's happening.
[265:09.43]By the way, those of you who think I'm fucking bullshitting you, I'm just a fucking bullshitter.
[265:15.11]Oh, he's not.
[265:15.61]There's no way.
[265:16.13]He doesn't even have an easy bake oven.
[265:19.87]He doesn't even... He doesn't even have an easy bake oven.
[265:25.75]Be right back.
[267:03.34]flexin'.
[267:04.60]It's like a Christmas photo.
[267:07.17]Dude, show me your Christmas haul, man.
[267:09.31]Yeah, this.
[267:09.95]What do you think?
[267:12.09]That's a Christmas haul tweet.
[267:16.93]That's an empty box.
[267:18.07]I was about to pick it up and shake it, but that's a bad idea.
[267:20.62]By the way, a quick question.
[267:23.24]Can an EasyBake oven burn you?
[267:25.22]It's made for, like, seven-year-olds, right?
[267:27.06]I can't get, like, burnt.
[267:30.24]Can I get burnt somehow?
[267:32.83]I can?
[267:33.11]I can?
[267:35.12]Okay, so I'm going to have oven mitts and shit because I don't want to get my hands burnt.
[267:39.83]You're going to get burnt.
[267:40.45]I'm not going to get burnt.
[267:41.27]I'm going to have big oven mitts on.
[267:42.65]And if this thing is made for seven and eight year olds, what's, how many, what, hold on.
[267:52.18]Danger.
[267:53.12]To prevent electric shock, do not immerse in water.
[268:00.93]I got my Easy Bake Oven!
[268:02.58]I'm gonna take a fucking bath and drop it in the bathtub!
[268:06.58]Are you fucking kidding me?
[268:08.88]Why would you do an Easy Bake Oven like in the bath?
[268:13.12]What's it for?
[268:13.58]Ages for what?
[268:15.92]What are they?
[268:16.32]How old do you have to be to use this?
[268:18.68]What is it?
[268:20.94]Why would you put?
[268:21.70]This thing has to be plugged in?
[268:23.02]What ages?
[268:26.07]Nutrition facts?
[268:27.37]One package of what?
[268:30.37]Wait, there's already- Wait, how- This stuff's been in here for a while.
[268:33.29]Can I still eat this?
[268:36.19]Chocolate brownie, vanilla frosting, and rainbow sugar crystals.
[268:39.31]These things probably aren't even edible anymore.
[268:40.87]Does it even have a name?
[268:44.95]Produced- What does this mean?
[268:46.91]What the fuck does that mean?
[268:48.63]Hold on.
[268:50.11]I need to take this- You need to see this.
[268:52.34]Produced with- Hold on.
[268:55.06]If I eat this, am I gonna turn into like a fucking mutant?
[268:57.90]I need to open this for a second.
[269:03.37]Okay, by the way, what is, what is, what is this?
[269:08.89]What is this?
[269:10.21]What is all this?
[269:12.43]What is, what is all this?
[269:14.19]Why is this like this?
[269:16.53]What is this?
[269:17.43]Why is it like this?
[269:19.43]What is this?
[269:22.66]Is this some kind of... A line there?
[269:28.60]There's a comedy line that I've said?
[269:29.98]All right, look it.
[269:33.08]Can you read that?
[269:37.04]Produced.
[270:00.83]Produced.
[270:03.60]Produced with... Produced... Produced... With... Genetic engineering.
[270:22.57]What the fuck does that even mean?
[270:29.72]Produced with genetic engineering.
[270:35.59]It's a 5G easy-bake oven.
[270:40.56]Most food, it's, well, it's a GMO.
[270:43.48]Oh, that means GMO.
[270:44.72]Why did they say made with GMOs?
[270:46.12]Why did they put genetic engineering?
[270:47.42]That makes it sound like a Resident Evil plot.
[270:56.87]Mixes contain wheat, milk, eggs, soy, and trace amounts of peanuts, tree nuts...
[271:04.10]And something else.
[271:07.49]Allergen information.
[271:08.85]Okay.
[271:11.63]Mixes contain wheat, milk, egg, soy.
[271:14.43]If you're allergic to soy, trace amounts of almonds.
[271:16.55]You know, those of you with nut allergies.
[271:18.31]Peanuts, tree nuts.
[271:21.32]And a fucking, like, Pokemon.
[271:23.72]And sulfites.
[271:25.08]Sulfites.
[271:29.00]What is a sulfite?
[271:34.62]Wait, this shit's got dye in it.
[271:38.48]Sugar.
[271:39.78]Carnauba wax.
[271:40.98]Confectioner's glaze.
[271:42.08]Yellow 5.
[271:42.92]Yellow 6.
[271:44.10]Red 3.
[271:44.72]Red 40.
[271:45.34]Blue 1.
[271:45.96]Blue 1.
[271:46.66]Lake.
[271:47.04]Red 40.
[271:47.78]Lake.
[271:48.66]I just gave you the coordinates to my house.
[271:54.66]What the fuck is that?
[272:05.21]Okay, well, this'll be fun.
[272:11.27]The ultimate oven.
[272:12.55]I'm gonna- I'm gonna get burnt, though.
[272:14.92]That's important.
[272:17.98]I'm gonna be in, like, fucking gloves.
[272:22.28]What did I walk in on?
[272:23.42]Uh, me leaking a stream to you.
[272:26.25]That's a- that's a stream leak.
[272:29.13]Do you think it said- do you think in there it says, like, do not consume alcohol when operating the EasyBake oven?
[272:40.67]Right?
[272:41.05]Probably bad idea, right?
[272:46.67]Well, it's for kids, so... It's for chi- Right, okay, I know, but what if it... Alright, I will- Okay, no.
[272:59.02]This is not a Nintendo Labo.
[273:01.46]This is a large piece of fucking electronic equipment that I could burn myself with.
[273:06.08]So I'm not...
[273:08.64]I probably shouldn't have, like, any wine.
[273:10.52]I'm gonna look up, like, how many glasses of wine can you have before using an Easy Bake Oven?
[273:17.12]One?
[273:24.89]Well, what the f- what?
[273:29.79]It was designed to be used with a dumb brain.
[273:31.91]It's made for what?
[273:35.65]It's made for kids.
[273:36.69]Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can still get hurt.
[273:40.11]What's the temperature that it gets in there?
[273:41.69]Oh, this is kind of freaking me out.
[273:44.41]Is this thing getting like... I hate ovens, by the way.
[273:46.75]We never even talked about this.
[273:48.47]I know this stream is supposed to be over.
[273:51.21]I fucking hate ovens.
[273:52.47]Ovens freak me the fuck out.
[273:53.39]I hate them.
[273:55.49]We've talked about this, right?
[273:59.19]It's just like the... Have we not gone over this?
[274:02.79]Have I been too embarrassed to talk about this?
[274:07.80]Okay, well, it's... An oven is this box that's in your house.
[274:15.25]And you turn it on, and this box gets to be three, four hundred plus degrees.
[274:22.05]Like five fucking hundred degree little box that has gas going into it.
[274:28.05]And it... I did the same thing?
[274:29.49]I've said... We've talked about... Yes, I have.
[274:30.80]Alright, okay.
[274:32.70]You did the same words.
[274:33.46]I just gotta be clear.
[274:36.55]I asked, I asked.
[274:37.51]I know I've talked about it before.
[274:40.11]So, does it get to be like 400 degrees in here?
[274:43.79]How hot does an Easy Bake Oven get?
[274:47.58]Like 350?
[274:47.78]How hot does it get?
[274:56.80]It's a children's toy with gas.
[274:58.80]No, you don't hook this up to like a gas line.
[275:00.82]I'm just saying, how hot does it get?
[275:02.84]It's, it's, wait.
[275:04.28]An EasyPay oven is a light bulb.
[275:07.08]It's a fucking light bulb?
[275:12.16]It cooks with a light bulb.
[275:14.40]Is that, can you, you, how?
[275:16.14]Oh, that's not even accurate.
[275:18.02]I put my hand up to some like halogen lights before and been like, oh shit, that's fucking toasty.
[275:24.13]I never thought to put like sprinkles on it.
[275:30.52]It's just a light.
[275:34.20]I could have a glass of wine if it's just a light bulb.
[275:38.22]I'm going to look that up.
[275:43.38]It's heat.
[275:45.72]Remember, don't eat the light bulb.
[275:46.80]I'm not going to eat the light bulb.
[275:49.62]Let's see.
[275:50.98]How hot does an easy bake oven get to?
[276:07.20]375 fucking degrees, guys.
[276:09.23]That's not a light bulb.
[276:10.79]That's 400 degrees.
[276:16.65]That's... Your oven gets to be 350, 400.
[276:20.61]That's gonna fuck... I'm gonna get hurt on that thing.
[276:25.45]It's a light bulb.
[276:28.52]How hot is the light bulb in this room right now?
[276:32.38]How hot is this light bulb?
[276:33.24]Let's see.
[276:35.30]Hey, but I need some water.
[276:38.71]That's hot.
[276:40.05]Is that 375 degrees though?
[276:41.47]Okay, let me ask a question.
[276:45.48]I actually have a question for you guys.
[276:47.52]So when you touch a light bulb and you go, fuck, that's hot.
[276:51.52]How hot is that?
[276:52.32]What degrees?
[276:53.68]At what degree are you like, whoa, that's fucking hot?
[276:56.51]Like your light bulb, the light bulb in your room.
[276:57.95]I'm sure you, like, right?
[276:59.29]200? 200?
[277:03.71]200 okay, so you tell me that that is gonna get 175 degrees hotter than the whoa that's hot Okay, I'm afraid to put I'm afraid to use this in my room I'm gonna like I'm gonna do the stream like in the garage I'm gonna go to I'm gonna do like a garage stream.
[277:22.03]That's gonna be creepy as fuck by the way What a creepy fucking stream I'm you doing an easy bake oven stream in a garage.
[277:32.40]I
[277:37.84]That's terrifying.
[277:42.41]Let's have Bugleberry do it.
[277:43.89]No, that's... Do you know how hot Bugleberry gets?
[277:47.89]Do you understand how hot Bugleberry gets in his skin?
[277:51.89]How hot Bugleberry's skin is when he's sitting there with the trench coat on and his big fucking face.
[277:57.73]You know how hot it is in that trench coat?
[278:00.85]Probably pretty hot, I would say, if I was Bugleberry and I was sitting there for like 20 straight minutes.
[278:05.61]And if I was him...
[278:13.72]I haven't used light bulbs for Easy Bake Ovens in literally decades.
[278:16.66]So what is in there?
[278:17.52]I'm gonna be like, wicked safety about this.
[278:23.27]I'm gonna be so safe with this.
[278:24.89]You have no idea.
[278:25.51]Because it's not just Easy Bake Oven.
[278:33.05]Easy Bake Oven is probably the main event of that stream, I would say.
[278:37.77]I'm gonna get a bunch of those little, like, kits.
[278:41.11]Those little, uh, like, cooking kits.
[278:43.61]Like, remember the thing I tweeted out?
[278:44.89]I'm gonna get, like, three or four, maybe five, six of those.
[278:47.39]And do them.
[278:52.59]Will it blend?
[278:53.47]No.
[278:55.51]It's a fucking toaster.
[278:58.11]Yeah, but I would... I would be, like, scared of a toaster.
[279:02.29]I don't know.
[279:02.59]Anything that generates heat is just kind of... For some reason, it freaks me out.
[279:06.91]I know it's, like, safe and shit.
[279:08.68]But, like, even a toaster.
[279:10.42]It's like... There's these little... There's these little... These wires in there.
[279:15.62]And they just get to be, like, six fucking million degrees.
[279:18.02]Just so concentrated.
[279:19.10]Concentrated fucking heat.
[279:20.99]And I just... I don't even want... No, I want to cook... I wish I could cook with the sun.
[279:26.07]If I could cook with the sun, I'd be... That'd be great.
[279:28.55]If there was, like, in everybody's backyard just one beam of fucking... Insanely hot, like, 400 degree heat light that was just in your backyard...
[279:36.58]Oh, you just like put like a hamburger fucking out there and like underneath the light.
[279:39.78]It was like, you flipped it.
[279:46.74]You live in Vegas, you can do that.
[279:48.10]Not until August.
[279:51.30]The sun is way hotter.
[279:54.72]All right.
[279:55.60]When you go like this, I know we're supposed to be ending the stream, but I have questions.
[279:59.84]When you're lying like this, and it's 120, like 115 degrees outside, how hot is 115 degrees?
[280:04.38]Okay.
[280:04.55]I was going to say, how hot is the sun on your face?
[280:07.41]It's 115 degrees.
[280:12.67]That's how hot it is outside.
[280:13.87]That's how hot it is.
[280:26.48]I don't know why I thought that, like, it was like a chemical reaction on your face.
[280:29.02]I don't know why I'm thinking that when the sun that's 115, like, is hitting your face, there's like a chemical reaction that goes up to like 180.
[280:36.62]You'd fucking melt.
[280:41.48]Your skin would be peeling off.
[280:45.79]Humidity, right, that's what I've been, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[281:04.61]If it's humid, it's nice.
[281:05.75]No, it's not.
[281:06.69]Absolutely horrible thing.
[281:07.77]I just heard somebody say, humidity is the worst thing in the world.
[281:11.35]It just is.
[281:12.63]I'm such a lizard fuck.
[281:15.62]Dry, just dry, dust air.
[281:21.90]I wish, what do you mean I wish I lived in that?
[281:25.94]I'm in like the driest fucking dustiest place in the United States of America next to maybe Arizona.
[281:32.14]God, I wish I lived there.
[281:35.17]What's that?
[281:39.71]Oh.
[281:40.59]I just sit in a chair in a room.
[281:41.99]I don't know where the fuck I am.
[281:44.13]Literally next to Arizona.
[281:48.59]Dry heats is, yeah.
[281:50.05]Wet heat sucks.
[281:53.70]How you guys doing?
[281:54.30]We good?
[281:54.98]Alright, I gotta go.
[281:56.08]I gotta go.
[281:56.42]I wanna get up and move around.
[281:58.10]End the stream waiting room.
[281:59.28]I'm gonna ban you for at least 15 minutes.
[282:01.66]Maybe you'll think about that over these- I'm gonna ban- No, no, no.
[282:03.65]I'm gonna ban you for 115 minutes for each degree.
[282:06.39]That it is outside.
[282:10.37]How's that sound?
[282:15.66]Okay.
[282:19.36]See you later, dude.
[282:23.68]You just lost a sub?
[282:37.35]Okay, what the fuck am I doing?
[282:39.75]See you guys tomorrow.
[282:40.91]Tomorrow?
[282:41.27]What are we going to do tomorrow?
[282:42.65]You know what?
[282:43.43]Maybe I'll finish... Should I finish Beautiful Joe tomorrow?
[282:46.30]I've got like another probably few hours on it.
[282:48.40]Finish Beautiful Joe tomorrow and... Hmm.
[282:51.98]Maybe.
[282:54.04]Why are we saying no?
[282:56.50]Why do you guys hate this game?
[282:57.66]Why do you... Alright.
[283:00.73]Why do you guys hate this game?
[283:05.53]Why does everybody hate this?
[283:07.43]This game is fun and exciting and there's characters in it.
[283:10.53]Why do you guys hate this game?
[283:12.19]It's boring.
[283:21.81]It's a good game.
[283:22.63]It's fun.
[283:23.23]It's engaging.
[283:27.82]I don't like dislike it.
[283:30.38]I love it, Jermo.
[283:31.26]Fuck the haters.
[283:34.68]Chat fucking hates this guy.
[283:36.22]They hate it.
[283:36.84]Chat hates this.
[283:38.95]And that's real.
[283:39.63]That's not even like, oh, he hates us joke.
[283:42.11]Chat, you guys hate this.
[283:43.05]I don't know if he's sad.
[283:53.32]Nice and sad.
[283:56.80]We actually hate it.
[283:58.80]It looks awful.
[284:00.84]Fuck.
[284:05.84]Hmm.
[284:08.71]It's fun to play.
[284:09.47]I don't like watching it.
[284:10.41]Damn it.
[284:21.23]Okay.
[284:24.91]But we're playing it tomorrow.
[284:27.87]And I blinked, like, twice.
[284:28.75]That's how, like, okay, now.
[284:36.84]When I say something and I say it and I blink, like, okay.
[284:39.20]That means, like, oh, he's fucking actually, like, annoyed by that.
[284:41.58]And, like, now you can see it in his eye blinks.
[284:47.24]No!
[284:48.24]I don't wanna!
[284:49.17]Look, I'll hold the right trigger down the whole time so it goes twice as fast.
[284:57.40]We just annoyed him.
[285:00.02]I'm doing it again.
[285:00.58]I am wicked blinky, though.
[285:04.11]I'm like a blinky person.
[285:07.15]That's the reason why I don't have the webcam on all the time.
[285:08.75]Because I usually just sit here and go like... He's a lizard.
[285:16.99]I know!
[285:17.39]And that's okay!
[285:21.17]I'm gonna cry tomorrow when the stream begins.
[285:23.19]Why?
[285:23.41]Because it's beautiful Joe?
[285:29.66]I like I like it but I we'll see I'd probably if I don't finish beautiful joe tomorrow and just know and what el germa germa you never finished games germa you know you always get halfway and then you you'd like just give up like what the fuck's up with that why do you do that well uh take a look at the chat right now and everybody why isn't it gonna finish beautiful joe it's not working what's going on
[285:54.55]Oh, they all hate it, and they're all screaming at me to stop playing.
[285:57.87]Does that watch work right now?
[285:58.89]Hmm.
[286:04.55]Jeremy's going to resign.
[286:07.45]He's mad.
[286:11.49]Mad enough to eat a fucking battery on stream?
[286:13.27]No, I don't even want to put that... That scares me, because...
[286:25.10]Can't you, like, touch... Okay, this is the plus and minus.
[286:27.88]If I, like, touch my tongue to the plus and, like, there's, like, a current on the... I'll, like, shock my mouth.
[286:33.04]I'm not gonna do that.
[286:33.60]That's a fucking terrible idea.
[286:34.75]That's a mistake.
[286:35.87]You could actually get hurt by that.
[286:37.53]Alright, what's more dangerous?
[286:41.95]Putting a battery in your mouth or operating an easy bake oven the way that it's supposed to be by the manual?
[286:54.72]Like, if I went like this and stuck my tongue on the battery, is that more dangerous than operating the EasyBake oven with parent-adult supervision, the way that it's intended to?
[287:03.79]What's more dangerous?
[287:17.75]Where does IQ go?
[287:18.21]I have 124 IQ, by the way.
[287:24.75]60 performance IQ, but, like, 100 visual, and then, like, 80 linguistical.
[287:32.36]That's actually real.
[287:34.02]I did a real, like, four-hour-long IQ test when I was, like, 17 or 16.
[287:37.64]I did it again when I was 20.
[287:39.04]I didn't want to find out what was wrong with me.
[287:41.97]And it turned out I was really fucking smart, but I was really stupid at doing things correctly.
[287:47.39]There you go.
[287:56.20]Was it on Facebook?
[287:57.42]No.
[287:57.74]Oh, yeah.
[287:59.04]Click here.
[287:59.78]It's five minutes.
[288:00.68]Ten questions.
[288:02.66]Yeah, those are just ways to find out how you lean politically, by the way, guys.
[288:08.32]Oh, question number three.
[288:11.57]Solve this cube.
[288:13.23]This cube, you have to move some pieces around.
[288:15.89]Thanks for clicking on our IQ test.
[288:17.67]Nice, nice.
[288:18.35]Okay, next.
[288:19.85]So over here is Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders is over here.
[288:24.87]Which one of these two would you say you lean more towards?
[288:29.73]This one.
[288:31.05]Okay, so question six is solve for X. That's something I care about.
[288:37.74]They don't, the questions one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 are fucking meaningless.
[288:43.61]They just want question three answered and you'll do it.
[288:46.07]Don't remind us.
[288:58.96]Collecting data.
[289:07.17]He actually took a Facebook IQ test.
[289:09.09]I think I did it on this stream like two months ago.
[289:18.47]The stream is never ending.
[289:19.51]I'm just chilling.
[289:20.51]Sometimes I just hang out.
[289:24.30]That was years ago.
[289:25.20]No, that was when I was in Vegas.
[289:31.70]For our ADHD exam stream.
[289:34.70]I couldn't... It's not even embarrassing me telling you this because... Hold on, I'm not done.
[289:40.65]I said my streams are going to be like four to five hours.
[289:43.03]We're at almost five.
[289:44.59]This is like a hangout session.
[289:47.65]If I took a high school test right now, like a real one, an actual high school test, geography, math, science, social studies, whatever, history...
[290:00.02]I'm going to be realistic, very realistic.
[290:03.86]I'd get probably between 5 and 10 points on the test.
[290:09.02]Without question.
[290:10.10]I would not get more than 10 points.
[290:15.30]Stand up and pace.
[290:19.10]Why?
[290:23.58]Stand up and pace and talk to you?
[290:30.00]Oh, yeah, because I can move around.
[290:34.39]Okay.
[290:36.13]So, I mean, if I took that test right now, if I was in your classroom, this is weird to me.
[290:45.79]I don't like this.
[290:54.26]I hate this.
[290:56.06]I need a microphone right here.
[290:57.10]If I don't have a microphone right here, then I'm just like a guy in a room walking around with no VR headset or anything.
[291:04.44]I'm just standing around and talking.
[291:06.75]So, if you gave me a test right now, and it was a high school test, and by the way, why do I always just not look at anybody?
[291:16.94]If there's a whole audience here,
[291:20.05]I'm never looking at anyone in the audience, literally ever.
[291:22.29]I'm looking at the exit signs.
[291:23.67]That's a tip, by the way, for those of you public speakers that want some public speaking tips.
[291:27.72]Just look at the exit signs back and forth.
[291:29.76]That's how you do it.
[291:31.02]So what you do is you go like this.
[291:32.06]There's an exit sign over there.
[291:32.92]I'm going to talk at that exit sign, and I'm going to move our eyes over here.
[291:35.16]I'm going to talk to this exit sign over here.
[291:37.33]I'm going to make a couple of points over on this exit sign.
[291:40.29]And then somebody's going to, I'm going to lock fucking eye contact with somebody randomly in the audience.
[291:46.20]And it's going to freak the both of us out for a split fucking second.
[291:49.52]It's going to go something like this.
[291:51.50]So if you gave me a test in high school and you said, Jeremy, Jeremy, if you gave me a test in high school and you said, Jeremy, find me software X, software Y.
[292:04.77]I'm not sure I'd be able to do it to you.
[292:06.19]And there's a reason why.
[292:07.84]The reason is, when we get older, we have two or three years after we graduate from school before we start to lose some of that information.
[292:18.57]It sucks.
[292:23.39]And then you're in the chair too, and you're like, he looks right in my fucking eyes.
[292:29.00]I'm like, I'll never forget that.
[292:35.09]short please try to do a math test I can't I can't it would be embarrassing hold on let me do the thing I did that hey hey hey hold on a second let me ruin my career real quick like I did a couple years ago remember this oh I'm gonna get off the chair and I went oh fuck right and then it literally ruined my whole career
[293:09.43]There we go.
[293:09.97]No.
[293:12.59]Remember this bullshit with, oh, measure the door.
[293:15.18]Measure him next to the door.
[293:16.76]Measure him next to the fucking door.
[293:18.20]We can see how he is next to the door handle.
[293:20.04]Okay.
[293:23.98]You want to play this fucking game?
[293:25.06]We'll play this game.
[293:26.83]There you go.
[293:27.55]There's the door.
[293:29.39]Measure him next to the door handle.
[293:31.73]Fine.
[293:32.63]Assholes.
[293:44.62]I'm pretty tall next to the door.
[293:52.61]Get closer to the door.
[293:54.09]If I get any closer to this, I'm going to hit my fucking head.
[293:58.69]This is like, this is fucking close.
[294:02.87]If I go closer, this is going to be bad.
[294:04.65]I mean, liar.
[294:08.84]I'm not... Get closer.
[294:10.36]I...
[294:18.48]I'm fucking as close as I can get.
[294:23.54]I can't... Do you want me to do it again?
[294:29.42]Fucking assholes, I swear to God, you're making me do this crazy shit!
[295:02.10]I can't even say it.
[295:03.06]Alright, goodbye.
[295:03.70]I'll see you tomorrow.
[295:04.55]I'll see you tomorrow.
[295:05.03]Okay, bye.
[295:07.39]What's going on with the hair?
[295:22.62]I can't get a fucking haircut right now, guys.
[295:24.88]Didn't you understand?
[295:26.86]I didn't get a haircut in fucking February.
[295:30.59]And you look like Hillary Clinton hair?
[295:34.79]Hillary Clinton hair?
[295:40.23]Just do it myself?
[295:41.31]Should I cut my own hair?
[295:42.44]No!
[295:42.62]All right, good night.
[295:43.92]See you tomorrow.
[295:44.58]Goodbye.
[295:44.76]Oh, forget it.
[295:47.38]We're getting to the bits.
[295:48.06]I didn't even do the bits.
[295:49.38]For some reason, I thought we did them and I was just like burning time for no reason.
[295:52.52]All right, let's hang on to the bits.
[295:59.41]I can't believe you guys hate Beautiful Joe.
[296:02.62]What the fuck?
[296:05.12]Stream the haircut.
[296:06.60]No, that's odd.
[296:07.60]Alright, let's teleport back.
[296:14.72]Hey, the Jewish bro, thanks for 500 bits.
[296:18.51]Thanks a lot.
[296:19.03]It's a watch.
[296:20.77]Manos, Hands of Fate.
[296:21.87]It's so bad.
[296:22.61]It's a good movie.
[296:24.75]I've heard that before, I think.
[296:28.58]I have heard that before.
[296:29.73]Where's the music?
[296:30.31]It should be playing right now.
[296:32.61]It's not.
[296:33.03]Now it is.
[296:36.06]Hey, StyxRenegade, thanks for the $2.50 I bought.
[296:37.96]I brought my sticker car into the mechanic.
[296:40.24]Originally, it was thought to be a $400 wheel bearing job.
[296:42.96]But it ended up being some rust.
[296:45.82]Cleaned up.
[296:46.76]Cost me $80.
[296:48.36]So I'm passing off a few of those savings to you, Germ Boy.
[296:52.02]By the way, I forgot why you won't play it.
[296:54.92]But can I suggest Jackie Chan Adventures for the PlayStation 1?
[296:57.46]One of the most frustrating games of my childhood.
[297:01.81]Um, I think I vicariously lived through Star making that video.
[297:08.11]Because we used to hang out in calls every single day, and I got the whole rundown, pretty much every level he was, everything he did.
[297:15.12]This is a different game.
[297:21.92]Oh.
[297:22.92]That's not the same game.
[297:23.94]Jackie Chan Adventures.
[297:24.82]What was the one that Star played?
[297:34.01]What was the Stuntmaster?
[297:36.01]Oh.
[297:37.39]I didn't know there was more than one Jackie Chan game for the PlayStation 1.
[297:41.31]Well, I'll look into it.
[297:44.55]Hey, Jason, thanks for the $2.50.
[297:45.75]Can we watch Auto Big Adventure, please?
[297:47.63]No.
[297:48.91]Dr. Dux, thanks for the thousand bits, $10.
[297:51.85]I didn't know Strong Bad had a game.
[297:53.91]Whoa.
[297:58.58]Shit, that does kind of look like Strong Bad.
[298:00.46]But they're different characters.
[298:01.92]Beautiful Joke has been on for a long time.
[298:07.97]Wembley TTV, thanks to the 250, joined the boopers, Jeremiah.
[298:11.33]I don't know what that is, but... No.
[298:14.15]I'm not going to join any boopers.
[298:16.72]Captain Nemo, thanks for 300 bits.
[298:18.06]You should watch Who Killed Captain Alex.
[298:19.88]It's not copyrighted.
[298:21.34]It's on YouTube, so it's perfectly fine to restream it.
[298:25.34]plan is on friday we're gonna come up with I want to try that feature but maybe we'll we'll come up with like a movie to watch like a public domain one maybe we'll figure that out tomorrow
[298:43.74]Thank you, Jason, for the $2.50.
[298:46.00]You incited us that the game was so hype only to give us a seizure on the start screen.
[298:50.96]This game gets a minus two out of plus two.
[298:54.01]Well, there's only two ratings there.
[298:56.51]And by the way, minus two and plus two are not ratings for video games.
[299:00.73]Did you think the last thing said was funny?
[299:04.35]You're not using the rating system correctly.
[299:07.72]I think a lot of you have not been using the rating system correctly for a little while now.
[299:15.41]No, it's for... Right.
[299:17.25]And for guests.
[299:18.45]Okay.
[299:22.79]Holeof1zombie, thanks for 250.
[299:24.17]When you're doing a Dr. Phil co-op stream... Also, how come you never mentioned KFC?
[299:30.90]Thoughts, Mr. McChicken.
[299:34.77]I don't really like KFC's bucket of chicken.
[299:37.35]I don't really like anything else from KFC.
[299:39.53]If I'm going to go to KFC, I want the bucket of extra crispy chicken, macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes.
[299:44.72]That's it.
[299:44.96]That's the only thing I ever order.
[299:46.00]Nothing else.
[299:48.24]In my opinion, there's no reason to order anything else from there.
[299:50.90]But that's just me.
[299:56.37]When am I going to go on Dr. Phil?
[299:58.31]I'm not going to go on Dr. Phil.
[300:01.15]Sir Canine, thanks for the $2.50.
[300:02.37]My master plan failed because of a Twitch chat formatting problem.
[300:06.45]Feels bad, man.
[300:08.15]Sorry about your plan.
[300:12.19]Uh, Friedelschitz, thanks for the $2.50.
[300:14.17]I always thought this game looked so cool when I was a kid, but I actually never got to play it.
[300:18.70]I'm so glad now that I'm finally experiencing it through my favorite streamer.
[300:21.70]So you like it?
[300:22.44]I'll...
[300:26.36]Should I change the title to Who Likes This Game?
[300:29.08]Do You Like Beautiful Joe?
[300:31.16]Okay, here we go.
[300:31.60]I'm going to change the title.
[300:33.54]This title makes sense still.
[300:36.44]Ongoing poll.
[300:37.46]Do you like Beautiful Joe?
[300:39.68]And I don't have to change any of the numbers.
[300:48.71]There.
[300:49.43]Don't have to change anything.
[300:50.27]Thanks for participating.
[300:56.54]And I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[300:57.78]It's a fun game.
[300:59.30]Hey, Robofussin.
[301:00.64]Thanks for the $5.
[301:01.68]Hope you're feeling better, kid.
[301:03.12]Worried about you.
[301:05.43]I'm doing fine.
[301:06.63]I'm doing just fine.
[301:07.41]Don't worry about me.
[301:11.25]Burr.
[301:16.01]Whoever that was.
[301:16.99]If you're still here.
[301:18.34]Probably not even still here.
[301:19.68]You probably said that and then were like, I don't know.
[301:21.52]Beautiful Joe sucks.
[301:22.38]And you probably left 20 minutes later.
[301:24.24]But that was funny.
[301:30.28]uh sticks renegade thanks for the 250 sorry I think I said jackie chan adventures I meant jackie I meant jackie chan stuntmaster so you did mean the one that started the video one if that's the case then I kind of already like I said I vicariously lived through it well that's by the way that's one of the best videos on youtube if you're curious that's like one of the best video gaming related uh videos on youtube
[302:00.44]But thanks to the 250, dude.
[302:09.00]What happened to my thing?
[302:10.81]What happened to my thing?
[302:14.93]What the fuck?
[302:17.11]What the fuck happened to my thing?
[302:19.85]Hold on.
[302:20.17]Yeah.
[302:20.43]He's a funny dude.
[302:21.05]He's very clever.
[302:21.49]He's a very clever dude.
[302:30.15]I have a thing.
[302:30.88]Yeah, I have like two things open.
[302:35.08]Why is this not working?
[302:41.06]Oh, there we go.
[302:41.66]Is it working now?
[302:45.97]Drew Crew is back.
[302:46.99]No, they are not.
[302:49.87]No, they're not.
[302:54.47]They are not.
[302:56.37]Nope.
[303:00.05]Here we go, alright, I got it.
[303:01.19]Uh, we had 250 from Yenwen.
[303:06.16]President artist.
[303:08.34]And they say... Uh, I was thinking of recommending a game that's by the same dev- I was thinking about recommending a game by the same developers as Beautiful Joe.
[303:29.58]Clover Studios, which was founded by Capcom.
[303:34.38]Okay.
[303:36.00]However, the game is around 30 plus hours.
[303:39.36]I'm about 34 hours into my playthrough and I'm at the last level.
[303:43.05]The game is Okami.
[303:44.25]I have actually experienced Okami before.
[303:47.97]Great game.
[303:48.39]The painting.
[303:49.15]Paintbrush.
[303:50.19]The dog.
[303:51.77]I think that's correct.
[303:52.65]I think that's the right game.
[303:54.11]You're a dog, right?
[303:55.33]You have a paintbrush.
[303:56.03]You paint with the paintbrush in Wii mode.
[303:57.07]Yeah, that's great.
[303:58.33]It's a great game.
[304:03.77]Don't you have a German 985 video about it?
[304:05.97]I don't think I made a video on Okami, but I have played it.
[304:11.77]No, I probably wouldn't stream it.
[304:13.39]But it is fantastic.
[304:15.30]It is a classic.
[304:15.92]And then they remade it.
[304:17.22]They remastered it once or twice, right?
[304:23.28]He's played it.
[304:25.36]Get out of here.
[304:27.74]But thanks for the recommendation, Yenwen.
[304:30.38]It's a great game.
[304:32.48]A Drax Vontor.
[304:34.06]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[304:35.32]Jerma, my brothers and I have loved watching you for years.
[304:38.02]And my dog is your biggest fan.
[304:39.48]So this is from all of us.
[304:41.30]Hey, thanks.
[304:42.54]Drax Vontor's dog.
[304:44.94]Also, you should play The Wonderful 101 when it comes out for the PC.
[304:47.38]Directed by the same guy who directed Beautiful Joe.
[304:49.58]Another great game.
[304:50.32]I have played it.
[304:50.88]I played it when it was on the Wii U. Because it was one of the only games on the Wii U that were worth buying.
[304:54.70]There's probably four.
[304:57.68]And that was one of them.
[304:59.48]I have played it and it's very good.
[305:04.35]I'm glad they're actually going to put it somewhere else.
[305:10.57]Thanks again.
[305:13.57]It's time for slime.
[305:14.73]What's going on time for slime?
[305:15.85]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[305:16.89]Ten bucks.
[305:18.45]You should filter out all caps chat messages for a day just as an experiment.
[305:23.85]See how much it throws off chat.
[305:26.75]Or, to go another step further, shadow ban people that write paragraphs in all caps.
[305:32.90]But, here's the sad part about doing something like that, is we remove, we then remove a person like the beautiful joe go
[305:42.94]brr thing that was all caps that person was just that person just that person was just thinking they were gonna get banned you know what I mean they they probably was just like you know I'm probably gonna get like timed out for this did they I'm not even sure they did like that was a fucking paragraph in caps does anybody like have that message where is it what was the exact message
[306:17.00]Cat is now in all-cats mode.
[306:18.46]He banned me.
[306:19.78]It was long.
[306:20.78]It was super long.
[306:23.05]It was just... I don't think anybody can have it.
[306:29.75]It's like an elusive beast.
[306:30.99]I don't think anybody has it.
[306:31.97]I don't think anybody has it.
[306:40.37]But yeah, maybe sometime.
[306:44.81]We'll try it maybe one day for fun.
[306:50.33]Thanks for the 10 bucks, though.
[306:51.15]Appreciate it.
[306:53.43]Thank you, Transcout, for the 500 bits.
[306:54.97]Jerma trapped me in a mason jar and forgot to put holes in the lid.
[306:57.62]Jerma, please.
[306:58.12]It's so dark in here.
[307:00.08]Um, unfortunately, I, uh, if, if there, it's been about four and a half hours.
[307:06.12]Um, I hope that, uh, we got, uh, it's been a long time.
[307:12.30]You, you alright?
[307:18.32]No air for four hours.
[307:24.03]Whoops!
[307:28.61]Thanks to the 500 bits though, you're really trying to get my attention to let you out of that gar.
[307:33.70]Well, thank you.
[307:59.91]You want to do an invite to Kraken Gamer?
[308:03.17]We already are there every day.
[308:05.03]We already are at Kraken Gamers.
[308:07.61]It's everybody here.
[308:08.81]Everybody here is on Kraken.
[308:09.97]We already exist there.
[308:10.93]I don't need an invitation.
[308:11.97]I appreciate it.
[308:18.81]Thanks for the $2.50.
[308:20.10]Have fun in Club Penguin.
[308:22.93]I can't believe that service is still on.
[308:24.05]Why is it so true?
[308:25.23]It's such a- What a- That's such a true statement.
[308:49.86]Drew Crew.
[308:51.16]Played Joho.
[308:52.88]Beautiful Joe sucked.
[308:53.72]I don't like, I don't like Burger King.
[308:56.66]Alright, fine, we're gonna go to McDonald's.
[308:58.67]Yeah!
[308:59.79]Yeah!
[309:00.41]Everyone gets so happy when you say that.
[309:09.10]I think that's also like, obviously we're making, we fuck around a lot on these streams.
[309:13.82]But I think the nature of playing a different game almost every single day.
[309:20.64]This stream never sees the same game.
[309:22.58]There's not like a game that it's like, oh, I play that.
[309:25.62]We're going to go to McDonald's.
[309:26.68]There is no McDonald's on this stream.
[309:28.92]There really kind of isn't.
[309:29.78]Because there's a new game every two or three streams, at least.
[309:33.97]So we kind of just try different restaurants every single day.
[309:39.28]And some people don't like those restaurants.
[309:40.58]Some people want me to go to another restaurant.
[309:42.24]Some people want me to go back to a restaurant that they really like, that they love eating at.
[309:46.45]And I love that restaurant too.
[309:55.31]I think that's part of the reason why there's a lot of requests.
[310:00.29]You're the Guy Fieri of streaming.
[310:03.82]I take two bites of the burger and then I leave.
[310:06.26]And I go, oh, that was Kielak.
[310:09.31]Out of the park, man.
[310:10.61]Oh, you nailed it.
[310:11.13]You nailed it.
[310:11.51]And then we play another one the next day.
[310:16.28]And in the background, you just...
[310:26.39]Or... There's two different songs.
[310:34.45]There's only two songs.
[310:36.03]Only two.
[310:37.07]On any episode of Dynasty Drives and Dives.
[310:39.85]There's the...
[310:41.39]I'm going to give you a list of stuff that this restaurant does.
[310:45.52]I'm going to give you, and it's going to, the guy's going to be like this.
[310:48.48]He's going to have the plate and he's going to just like throw the plate into the camera.
[310:51.90]It's going to go ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, where to join.
[310:55.14]And then he starts explaining all the things in the menu.
[310:57.95]That's that one.
[310:59.03]The other song is that I'm about to take a big fucking bite of your hamburger.
[311:03.75]So it's, hold on.
[311:04.83]No, I don't want to put that on camera.
[311:06.53]That's weird.
[311:07.77]He goes in for the bite, and it does that... And he goes... And he leans around... There's only two songs on that show, but it works, and it's a great show.
[311:25.04]I love that show.
[311:26.34]That show is fucking phenomenal.
[311:28.22]I'm a weirdo.
[311:29.90]I like to watch Guy Fieri take bites of hamburgers while I eat my bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[311:36.01]I love eating with Guy Fieri.
[311:38.20]I love watching him like, oh, we're at this like crepe restaurant.
[311:40.72]Oh, cool, man.
[311:44.42]I'm eating food too.
[311:45.18]And I love my, I like my food.
[311:46.46]I'm watching you eat food while I like to eat my food too.
[311:49.44]Where's he now?
[311:50.04]Oh, those ribs look good.
[311:51.07]Another bite of my fucking taco.
[311:53.05]Oh man, I love food.
[311:55.25]If you don't do that, then I also don't believe that you don't spend 30 minutes in the bathroom sometimes.
[312:02.89]I just don't.
[312:07.48]You do Fieri mukbangs?
[312:16.04]So?
[312:16.57]Who cares?
[312:17.15]I really like Guy Fieri.
[312:20.15]I think he's great.
[312:22.21]I really do.
[312:23.29]I like him.
[312:25.11]I really like him.
[312:27.04]I think he's fucking phenomenal.
[312:28.78]He's such a swell person.
[312:37.75]He seems like a cool dude.
[312:39.01]Yeah, he... He does!
[312:42.27]I bet you he's... If you met Guy Fieri... You were out somewhere, and you went to one of his restaurants, and he was there.
[312:49.95]I bet you he'd come over, and I bet you he'd be so happy to talk to you.
[312:53.45]I really believe that.
[312:55.21]That's what I hear.
[312:55.73]What is he, your best friend?
[313:02.47]No.
[313:05.51]He's best friend material.
[313:15.31]I'm not going to talk to a grown man with a flame shirt.
[313:19.31]No, no, no, but you'll watch a grown man in a Star Wars shirt.
[313:26.47]Do you see how that logic is kind of a little flawed?
[313:31.53]You'll watch a grown man eat his shoe.
[313:35.69]Right?
[313:37.01]I'm not that different than Guy Fieri.
[313:39.23]Except my hair is not as cool.
[313:45.31]Pronounce it right.
[313:46.29]It's Fieri, right?
[313:47.25]Fieri.
[313:48.69]Fieri?
[313:50.09]It's not Fieri.
[313:51.25]It's Fieri.
[313:52.73]Guy Fieri.
[313:53.97]Fieri.
[313:55.65]There it is.
[313:56.53]I knew it.
[314:00.63]I ate my burger while you were eating your shoe.
[314:06.30]He's got a shirt.
[314:07.50]It's like a brand.
[314:08.46]It's an image.
[314:09.70]He's got his own brand.
[314:11.74]Who cares?
[314:12.62]Who cares?
[314:14.43]He wears like the bowling shirt and he's got the hair.
[314:17.51]It's a brand thing.
[314:18.63]It's like an image thing.
[314:19.69]So you know who he is.
[314:22.71]You could recognize Guy Fieri from a mile away.
[314:27.28]You would know who he was.
[314:30.62]What's the German brand?
[314:34.30]I don't have one.
[314:35.98]I don't need a brand.
[314:43.89]Toilet water.
[314:44.59]That's not a brand.
[314:45.37]That's a delicious drink.
[314:50.71]Anyways.
[314:55.00]Alright, we're getting close to the end here.
[314:55.98]We're gonna do, uh, Barb.
[314:57.30]Broski, thanks for 500 bits.
[314:58.86]My mom overheard me watching you.
[315:00.28]She said, boy, that's an angry fella.
[315:04.97]Hey, Streaky, thanks for the 500 bits.
[315:07.75]Free money.
[315:08.63]I'll take it.
[315:09.81]Gray blob, thanks for the 400 bits.
[315:11.55]Hash house a go-go, baby.
[315:13.43]How could I have not thought that?
[315:16.25]How could I have not thought that?
[315:19.17]How is it possible that I didn't come up with that on this stream?
[315:22.83]Hash house a go-go, baby.
[315:24.23]Why?
[315:24.49]I would have said it a thousand times.
[315:28.25]Nice work.
[315:31.38]Hash house a go-go, baby.
[315:33.48]Fuck.
[315:34.10]I would have said it.
[315:34.82]I would have loved that.
[315:37.77]Thank you, Clinks, for the 10 community subs.
[315:40.44]Five back-to-back.
[315:41.22]Thanks, Clinks.
[315:43.98]A gnarly thanks to the 250.
[315:45.26]These 250 bits will pay for one-tenth of Glue Man's cape in the live rumble.
[315:49.99]If I keep this up, you'll have the stream ready in about 30 years.
[315:53.55]See you then.
[315:54.85]Thank you for the contributions.
[315:58.83]Thank you.
[315:59.98]Hey, the plushie.
[316:00.60]Thanks for the $2.50, plushie.
[316:01.76]Hey, Jeremiah, my birthday's coming up soon.
[316:03.46]I have no friends, a sick mom, and nothing to do but drink and play games.
[316:07.56]Hope you can stream on the 13th.
[316:08.86]It would make my day.
[316:12.58]The 13th is... Let's see.
[316:16.47]We're going... We went today.
[316:18.95]We're going Thursday.
[316:19.75]We're going Friday.
[316:21.85]We might go... Maybe Saturday.
[316:24.89]Okay.
[316:26.30]If not, then we're going to do probably Monday.
[316:28.40]Yeah, I'll be live on Monday.
[316:33.09]I will.
[316:33.61]I'll be live.
[316:34.47]Yeah, I'll be live on Monday.
[316:41.13]I mean, happy birthday on Monday.
[316:47.54]I'm going to be live on Monday.
[316:50.64]I don't see why I wouldn't unless something comes up, but I don't think it will.
[316:54.71]Kim and I are at the absolute finish line now, so everything should be good to go.
[316:59.85]Hey, where's my keys?
[317:00.63]Thanks for the $3.
[317:02.49]$2.99.
[317:02.53]Chocolate Factory stream, maybe.
[317:05.89]There will be no stream where I have to interact with other people.
[317:12.41]And this is absolutely the case until the coronavirus stuff is taken care of and slows down and gets to a point where we can kind of open back up.
[317:20.79]Because there's no way that a chocolate factory is doing tours right now.
[317:26.15]Not during this whole thing.
[317:27.33]I would not.
[317:28.01]There's no way.
[317:29.59]So we have to kind of just let that... Let's see what that does.
[317:38.17]Coronavirus is still very bad.
[317:43.86]Is the stream over?
[317:44.58]Yes, the stream is over.
[317:46.04]Back tomorrow.
[317:48.76]But when it's safe to do that, and when it's a little bit further down the road, hopefully soon, I will make a few phone calls.
[317:59.96]John Cena is kill, thanks for the 250.
[318:02.21]Jerma, don't worry so much about not being able to stream in longer periods.
[318:06.33]My brother suffers from P... Oh, that's funny...
[318:16.33]Is this it?
[318:16.71]Wait a minute.
[318:18.07]Penile Shrinkulosis?
[318:20.37]That's not real, right?
[318:28.80]It's tough for him to... You have that.
[318:35.44]It's real and you have it.
[318:37.40]What the fuck?
[318:42.78]No, I don't... Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[318:48.57]You just wrote, ha ha ha ha ha, then Omega Lull.
[318:51.79]Pick one, alright?
[318:53.11]Pick one.
[318:54.49]It's either one or the other.
[318:55.43]Hey, Sir Canine, thanks for the $2.50.
[319:00.98]It's funny because the Easy Bake Oven stream would just look like Jerma cooking with a funny pink oven or something.
[319:06.84]I'm gonna get fucking hurt.
[319:08.48]I'm gonna be in like a suit of armor.
[319:14.04]Kooskoos, thanks for the 250.
[319:15.16]Hey Jerma, hope you're feeling better soon.
[319:16.40]I'm going through some scary hell stuff right now.
[319:18.96]Your streams help me forget about it for a bit.
[319:20.76]Hope it does the same for you.
[319:22.26]It does.
[319:26.08]It does.
[319:27.90]Being able to hang out and just fuck around and laugh and chill is... It's a lot of fun.
[319:34.89]It helps.
[319:35.19]It does.
[319:36.39]Thanks for the 250.
[319:40.51]Let's get the credits rolling.
[319:41.41]I'm going to bump you in the face a little bit here.
[319:43.94]Sorry about that.
[319:45.50]Got you.
[319:46.80]Sorry I bumped you.
[319:47.34]Okay, let's run him.
[319:54.27]Here come all the subs today.
[319:56.43]They'll be flying by in just a moment.
[320:01.76]Just a second.
[320:02.38]What's gonna happen?
[320:04.30]Here it comes.
[320:05.72]Here it comes.
[320:07.76]We'd like to thank you for subscribing to the channel.
[320:10.06]Thanks a lot.
[320:13.05]Appreciate it.
[320:14.17]Thanks, Ollie.
[320:22.41]Clap.
[320:22.85]Shit movie.
[320:23.73]You're doing a great job.
[320:26.45]A great job.
[320:27.75]That's one of the best... Okay, that's... If that's the second best video on YouTube... No, that's the best video on YouTube.
[320:34.50]I'm gonna just stamp that right now.
[320:41.52]And it's not even a video.
[320:42.40]That's how good it is.
[320:44.12]That shit's not even a video.
[320:45.30]It's audio only.
[320:46.08]It's the best video on YouTube.
[320:49.14]Hey, Vertible Giant, thanks for the 500 bits.
[320:50.86]I was curious about the Mugen stream, so I checked the character archive.
[320:55.48]And there are about 71,500 characters.
[321:00.47]Most of them are around 10 to 100 megabytes.
[321:03.45]So assuming they average around 50 megabytes, downloading every character would take about 3.57 terabytes.
[321:13.77]Jesus.
[321:17.37]71 fucking thousand characters?
[321:19.37]How- What does the character's select screen look like?
[321:22.17]It's just a bunch of dots?
[321:26.94]Is that even possible?
[321:30.04]That's almost bo- Oh, it's- I'm gonna do it.
[321:31.92]There's a hundred pages of characters.
[321:35.68]Holy shit.
[321:41.51]Is that- Can you even play the game like that?
[321:47.52]You need to screen for porn.
[321:48.86]Oh, I will.
[321:49.66]Don't worry.
[321:53.34]You're gonna fucking brick a PC.
[321:56.72]Well, hopefully it's an old one that doesn't matter.
[321:59.90]One that I haven't really cared about in probably five plus years.
[322:03.19]I'm just gonna have to put a hard drive in it.
[322:06.11]A few of them.
[322:07.71]Can you buy... Okay, what... Not an SSD.
[322:12.23]A five terabyte SSD would be like two thousand fucking dollars.
[322:17.48]A 5 or 10 terabyte hard disk drive would be... You can still get this for pretty cheap, right?
[322:32.17]Yeah, like a 10 terabyte HDD would be probably a couple hundred bucks.
[322:36.99]Okay.
[322:38.87]That's much better than like 2,000 or 3,000.
[322:40.01]Yeah.
[322:40.34]Alright.
[322:43.42]I'm going to have my Mugen drive.
[322:49.92]I see everybody doing a link here.
[322:52.88]The whole chat is purple, so I'm going to screen it and see what it is.
[322:57.55]Okay.
[322:59.87]This is a six second video.
[323:02.25]Okay.
[323:04.75]Apparently this is
[323:29.59]and it's off six seconds long cody check it out it's the drew crew
[324:02.62]Why does it take me so long to pull something up?
[324:05.26]Uh, because I don't have browser capture on by default.
[324:09.07]Because every time... There are links that are, like, spammed in the chat, and I, like, have to close them, and... Look, when I become a professional streamer, I'm gonna have a completely separate cap device that just pulls a browser window, and it's gonna feed into the stream.
[324:25.68]Just, I've gotta grow up as a streamer a little bit, and sometimes it takes me a little while...
[324:32.71]Okay, once I upgrade from a 1080 graphics card is when I'll start having it easier.
[324:39.31]And plus, I don't want to click on random shit.
[324:41.29]Just open it.
[324:43.14]It takes me a few moments to make sure this is a legal thing to show on stream.
[324:47.30]Because I know, I've heard of streamers in the past.
[324:50.56]They just open up fucking every link that they see or they get sent to.
[324:53.82]And then there's like a dick on screen.
[324:56.19]And then there's like something horrible or something bad.
[324:58.87]And then they close the window real quick.
[325:00.29]And then they get yelled at.
[325:01.35]Or they get in trouble.
[325:01.93]They get banned.
[325:04.16]So, you know, that's possible.
[325:08.56]Hey, thanks to the Drew crew.
[325:13.64]We're going to go to the end screen.
[325:16.76]See you guys tomorrow.
[325:19.07]Running around the same time.
[325:22.41]Still have some bits left to do, but we can wind down.
[325:26.97]Hey, Large27x, thanks for the 600 bits.
[325:29.19]Jerma, please don't play this again.
[325:30.33]For the love of God, just please.
[325:39.37]And there's it.
[325:40.35]I think my stream just crashed.
[325:44.23]Okay.
[325:45.29]Freddy Dredd just gave 50 community subs and my computer hung for five straight seconds.
[325:52.20]Holy shit.
[325:55.46]Thanks, Freddy, for the 50 subs, dude.
[326:02.14]Thanks for the insane amount of money you've given this stream.
[326:04.77]You continue to.
[326:05.81]You keep giving this stream this shitload of money, dude.
[326:12.13]Thanks for the fucking crazy money.
[326:15.33]Another 50 subs from Freddie.
[326:20.20]Hillary Clinton.
[326:24.06]Oh my god.
[326:31.97]Shit.
[326:39.14]It's the same.
[326:40.86]It is the exact same hair.
[326:53.46]That's not good.
[326:54.30]I haven't been able to get a haircut in like three months.
[326:57.90]I have to get a haircut.
[326:58.94]Okay, Kim's going to cut my hair.
[326:59.82]I'm going to ask very nicely.
[327:02.73]I'm going to show Kim this image.
[327:04.25]I'm going to say, Kim, I have Hillary Clinton hair.
[327:06.25]Can you please help me?
[327:12.76]And we'll see what it looks like.
[327:13.74]Do it on stream.
[327:23.63]No, I'm not going to do a haircut stream.
[327:29.45]Let us cut it.
[327:31.92]How would we go about doing something like that?
[327:36.64]Hey, thank you Thrag... Thrag Nell for the 500 bits.
[327:41.82]German, next time, can you please eat your shoe and similar items and stream it under social eating with absolutely no context one day?
[327:52.20]Click map on head.
[327:54.50]Nope.
[327:55.36]Because I know exactly what you guys are going to do.
[327:58.34]You guys are going to give me the Hulk Hogan.
[328:01.52]The worst haircut you could possibly ever have as a human being.
[328:05.03]That's the long.
[328:06.53]The hair stays the same length on the sides and the back.
[328:09.37]But the whole top is shaved.
[328:12.13]I know, because that's what I would do.
[328:13.83]If I had the choice to pick a haircut for somebody, and it was something, okay, I'll do any haircut.
[328:20.08]No, buzz it.
[328:21.34]Oh, what the fuck, I'm buzzed.
[328:23.12]Nope.
[328:24.00]Dude, just cut randomly.
[328:25.76]Nope, give him the Hulk Hogan.
[328:28.96]That's just, it looks bad on everyone.
[328:31.40]No one looks good with a Hulk Hogan haircut.
[328:33.70]Not even Hulk Hogan does.
[328:35.73]And he's the one that, he's the guy that has it.
[328:37.55]He's the guy that made it up.
[328:45.40]It's a mullet.
[328:46.44]No, a mullet would be longer in the back, shorter on top.
[328:50.30]The Hulk Hogan is shaved and bald on top, long everywhere else.
[328:57.15]Hulk Hogan's haircut, the Hulk Hogan, is like a shower curtain.
[329:01.75]You know, it's just like a shower curtain around your head, starting at your temples and going back around the back of your head.
[329:14.86]The term is skullet derma.
[329:19.78]Alright, that's not even like fair.
[329:22.02]Somebody just, that's... They say, well, Hulk Hogan is just ugly.
[329:26.56]No, that's not even... He's not!
[329:30.04]Like, Hulk... That's not even true.
[329:34.56]Hulk Hogan's not, like, ugly.
[329:37.40]Go back to like Hulk Hogan in like the 80s and the 90s.
[329:40.08]He wasn't a bad looking guy.
[329:41.62]He wasn't an ugly guy.
[329:43.76]That's not even fair.
[329:45.22]He's insanely ugly?
[329:48.16]What the fuck?
[329:49.84]No, he was not.

[330:50.40]Yeah, guys.
[330:50.96]I got news for you.
[330:51.98]When you turn 70, you don't look that great anymore.
[330:56.56]Like, that's... When you turn, like, 68, you get older and you look, like, wrinkly and shit.
[331:02.18]He's a handsome guy.
[331:04.66]Let's try another one.

[332:10.32]Hey, Killkun, thanks for the 300 bits.
[332:12.30]Jerma, don't forget about Rain World.
[332:13.82]Already did.
[332:14.59]If you don't play it, Slugcat will starve to death.
[332:16.53]He already has.
[332:17.89]You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
[332:19.29]I wouldn't, but it happened.
[332:20.43]That would make you a Jerma psycho.
[332:21.85]I am.
[332:24.81]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[332:27.01]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[332:28.77]Manos is also one of MST3K's most popular movies they have riffed.
[332:34.86]That's where you know it from.
[332:36.12]Have a good night.
[332:38.06]Probably, yeah.
[332:39.50]I've seen a lot of the old MST3K.
[332:46.83]It was so good.
[332:47.57]You guys understand that MST3K is your original, like, React channel?
[332:53.35]Except they were funny.
[332:54.87]They had actually funny things to say.
[333:01.44]Oh, yeah, I know.
[333:09.92]They still do shit, don't they?
[333:13.34]Doesn't, um... They do riff tracks, right?
[333:20.34]Does Mike, um... Mike Nelson still does riff tracks, right?
[333:26.18]Don't they stream on Twitch?
[333:31.12]Do they have at least, like, 1,000 to 2,000 viewers to stream?
[333:33.76]If they don't, I'm going to be very upset and very sad.
[333:40.01]There's a RiffTrax rerun stream.
[333:42.01]Oh, okay.
[333:43.73]Do they do live shows on Twitch?
[333:53.31]No, they do not do live shows on Twitch.
[333:55.28]Oh, okay.
[333:55.72]They just do reruns.
[333:56.58]Okay.
[333:57.34]It's a 24-7 rerun stream.
[333:58.80]Oh, okay.
[334:00.00]That's still cool, though.
[334:05.48]I used to love that shit.
[334:08.34]They were hilarious.
[334:17.69]They do live shells somewhere else.
[334:23.82]Raid rift tracks.
[334:26.74]We could.
[334:27.26]I mean, I don't think there's going to be anybody there to react to your raid, but we could.
[334:36.65]Some IT guy is going to be like, what the fuck?
[334:39.29]Hello?
[334:41.19]I'm not sure anybody's there.
[334:43.96]We'll see.
[334:49.37]I'm here for this stream.
[334:50.65]Or for the stream.
[334:51.55]Alright, let's finish up.
[334:53.37]Let's finish up.
[334:55.37]We've spent the last probably hour and a half just dicking around.
[334:59.07]I'm happy about that.
[335:02.47]Cheekzilla, thanks for the $2.50.
[335:03.80]Put an ad on Craigslist for someone to come to your home and cut your hair.
[335:07.20]I spent money to pass you this message, so sleep on it.
[335:09.52]I'm not going to do that.
[335:11.38]There's no way I'm going to have somebody from Craigslist that I've never met before come into my house with a sharp object.
[335:16.76]I don't think that's something I'm going to do.
[335:19.78]SirK9, thanks for the 250.
[335:21.06]JermaWalk, Minecraft rafters in chat.
[335:23.64]JermaWalk.
[335:26.87]I'm not going to do a Minecraft Let's Play.
[335:28.83]It's not going to happen.
[335:29.69]I just want to make sure everyone knows that very, very clearly.
[335:33.09]SkinnyPeter, thanks for the 300 bits.
[335:35.33]This game looks pretty cool.
[335:36.33]Thanks, Jerma.
[335:37.41]Thanks, one of 15, 14 other people that voted yes.
[335:42.38]Thank you.
[335:44.02]LockyMan, thanks for the 300 bits.
[335:45.30]Have you thought about playing the Strong Bad Flash game someday?
[335:48.97]They might not be online after Adobe stopped supporting Flash.
[335:51.80]Someone would probably convert them.
[335:54.00]There'd probably be somebody that would get in there and get the code and turn it into HTML5 or something.
[335:59.18]Probably.
[336:02.40]What about FTK?
[336:03.36]FTK's not a Let's Play of Minecraft 1.0.
[336:10.71]But, uh, probably not.
[336:12.95]I never really got into the Homestar Runner stuff.
[336:17.11]It's not that I didn't like it.
[336:18.01]I just didn't really get into it.
[336:21.65]Produces Asan.
[336:22.83]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[336:24.07]Always miss you when you're gone for a long while, king.
[336:26.38]That's another king.
[336:27.82]Laughs help a lot, especially through these tough times.
[336:29.76]It means a lot.
[336:30.94]Can't tell you how much.
[336:32.22]Thanks and have a nice night.
[336:35.96]Thank you.
[336:36.89]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[336:37.51]Appreciate it.
[336:40.86]I mean, it's... It's hard... It's not hard to hear or weird to hear.
[336:42.50]It's... I mean, for me, it's weird that I've been interested for this long.
[337:10.15]I am so all over the place that it's shocking to me that for almost 10 straight years, I've never felt really once like, ah, I don't really fucking feel like that, doing that now.
[337:24.52]I don't want to do that right now.
[337:26.76]That happens all the fucking time to me, leading up to this.
[337:33.98]I used to drop shit immediately within six months.
[337:40.63]So I'm happy and surprised and lucky and blessed and everything you want to call it to be doing this as long as I have.
[337:48.71]And still really enjoy it ten fucking years later.
[337:53.67]So thanks.
[337:55.89]Hashtag blessed.
[337:56.88]No, but you know what?
[337:57.60]I'm just giving you adjectives.
[338:00.08]Hey, FartGuts, thanks for the great username and the five dollars.
[338:06.13]Uh, Spaghetti... Spaghetti 1 Nero.
[338:10.07]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[338:12.01]So glad I've been able to watch your streams live.
[338:13.79]This is probably my second-ish stream.
[338:16.33]And both have been pretty fun.
[338:18.12]That's good to hear.
[338:19.42]I'm glad my social media strapped me down to a chair and forced me to watch all your clips.
[338:25.72]I hope you feel better.
[338:26.46]Thanks for making quarantine cool.
[338:31.67]Yeah, welcome.
[338:33.05]Second stream, that means by the third one you're going to figure out if you're going to stay here long term.
[338:36.84]That's tomorrow.
[338:37.78]If you're here tomorrow, I've got to make sure tomorrow's a good one.
[338:40.84]I could tomorrow, but it'd be a good fucking stream.
[338:43.08]Otherwise, that's the third stream and I might lose you.
[338:46.10]We'll find out.
[338:53.04]Are you still doing a community content night on the 10th?
[338:55.56]Fuck, right, I did say that I want to do it.
[338:58.42]Ah, shit.
[338:59.38]Is that the public domain movie night?
[339:02.60]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[339:04.43]Ah, fuck.
[339:13.95]Ah, I gotta figure that out.
[339:15.11]I gotta figure out where I want to do that.
[339:19.98]There was endless promises.
[339:23.30]Catching up to him.
[339:25.22]Endless promises.
[339:30.14]We'll do it.
[339:30.74]We'll do it.
[339:32.34]We'll do it within the next, like, seven days.
[339:34.58]I promise.
[339:36.12]I know.
[339:39.00]I'm full of endless promises and lies and just nonsense.
[339:43.20]I'm bullshitting.
[339:44.48]I'm not bullshitting you right now, though.
[339:45.89]I'm trying to make sure that future me does not bullshit you here.
[339:49.72]But he might, and I can't stop him.
[339:51.42]Because five days from now, future me might have someone else who's doing it.
[339:57.55]I'm just trying to tell him in the future.
[339:59.69]Just do it on, like, the fucking 14th or something.
[340:04.07]You can do it then.
[340:05.37]Listen to me.
[340:08.75]Future German's out of control.
[340:09.95]He is, because I'm going to reference... Someone's going to flip this and show it to me on the 15th when we didn't do it on the 14th.
[340:15.44]And I'm going to be like, well, you know, I had all these things to do, and...
[340:20.83]We gotta keep future Jerma honest.
[340:25.66]Coming soon.
[340:28.18]Thanks for the 450.
[340:28.72]Hey Jerma, hi chat.
[340:30.10]Haven't been able to see more than like an hour of streams lately because of school.
[340:34.62]Hope that you and chat have been doing well and staying safe.
[340:38.11]Thanks for all the laughs.
[340:38.99]King again.
[340:39.99]Okay, I'm not gonna reference King anymore.
[340:46.49]I'm not even gonna read it.
[340:47.59]I'm gonna say thanks for the laughs.
[340:48.55]Thank you.
[340:49.69]Thank you for watching.
[340:53.28]Fart Guts gave another $5.
[340:55.61]Yankee with no brim.
[340:57.67]With pug champs.
[340:59.93]Still don't know what that means.
[341:00.69]I'm going to have to look it up after the stream.
[341:02.73]Chunky Baloney thanks for the $2.50.
[341:03.92]If you're taking GameCube recommendations, Eternal Darkness is one of the best.
[341:08.10]And if you don't have it already, I do.
[341:11.24]I have Eternal Darkness sitting right behind me.
[341:15.14]P.S.
[341:15.38]Been watching 2nd Gerbovids during the isolation and in the Octogeddon video from 2018, you basically tell chat to smoke crack.
[341:24.49]This is the origin of crack streams.
[341:26.15]Look it up.
[341:28.75]What?
[341:33.21]Octogeddon?
[341:34.15]Where?
[341:34.85]Octogeddon?
[341:36.77]Which one?
[341:40.54]2nd Gerbovids?
[341:41.46]Octogeddon?
[341:42.10]Oops, all penguins.
[341:44.82]When did they tell people they smoke crack?
[341:49.71]Feel the cool mist.
[341:54.13]And maybe some... Some girl will walk by you and... Throwing fucking trash.
[342:07.09]Contract.
[342:08.65]What is the... What... What... This is what I do when I turn streams on?
[342:12.59]What the fuck is that?
[342:15.37]The whole class is going to laugh at you.
[342:21.16]Okay, when do I tell people to smoke crack?
[342:25.10]4 minutes and 84 seconds?
[342:29.92]Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
[342:32.48]That's not 84 seconds.
[342:37.82]I still have the 484.
[342:39.14]I'm sorry.
[342:39.66]Here it is.
[342:46.68]I saw the 4.84 of the timestamp.
[342:52.24]No, this is not even the right video.
[342:56.34]Why are you linking me this?
[342:57.52]Why are you linking me a Q&A I did from like fucking 2011?
[342:59.89]No, I want the octageddon clip.
[343:19.70]I'm screening this.
[343:29.21]Oh, it's relevant.
[343:30.51]Right, okay.
[343:32.89]Okay, we can listen to this.
[343:34.35]Fuck.
[343:35.07]Quick story, actually, for you guys.
[343:36.63]I'm sure some of you would think this is actually kind of interesting.
[343:38.57]I lose interest so quickly.
[343:39.47]I'm like, wow, I stayed interested.
[343:40.55]When I first did my first Team Fortress 2 commentary a couple months ago...
[343:44.91]I did two in a row and I uploaded them on the same night and the next morning I woke up and I said, I don't want to do this.
[343:55.68]No one's going to watch me.
[343:56.76]I'm too old for this.
[343:57.78]I can't do this.
[343:59.08]So I deleted all the videos and I was going to delete the account.
[344:07.40]It's true.
[344:08.22]That did happen.
[344:09.54]That did happen.
[344:10.14]I deleted them all.
[344:11.32]Because I was like, I'm too old.
[344:14.62]And this is 2011, by the way.
[344:16.51]I'm 35 this year.
[344:18.05]Am I too old yet, Mr. Albertson?
[344:20.83]Have I reached that point, Mr. Albertson?
[344:22.71]This fucking 25-year-old.
[344:26.23]What the hell does he know?
[344:27.09]He doesn't know shit.
[344:28.11]He thinks he knows everything about the world.
[344:29.56]No, you don't.
[344:30.06]And then I talked to a friend of mine who said, you know what?
[344:34.06]You might as well just go for it.
[344:36.62]Yeah, thanks for that.
[344:37.34]Thanks for the advice.
[344:39.08]If you stop streaming, I swear.
[344:40.90]All right, where's the crack part?
[344:43.96]Where's the... Why did you link me this?
[344:45.66]Where's the... Where I tell people to smoke crack?
[344:57.97]Do that.
[344:58.33]There was absolutely no reason for that.
[345:00.73]That's going to be the reason why I lose.
[345:03.47]Why me...
[345:06.50]I'm dead.
[345:06.78]I'm gonna die.
[345:08.62]I need a time stamp for the crack part.
[345:11.32]Anybody have a time stamp for the crack part?
[345:15.39]Jesus Christ.
[345:16.31]Just stop talking for a minute.
[345:20.67]Where's the crack part?
[345:22.61]Use the bees and have them on one side.
[345:28.81]Very easy.
[345:29.75]Wow!
[345:33.37]You got two artilleries shooting at me?
[345:36.69]747.
[345:37.03]Launcher.
[345:38.06]Artillery.
[345:39.92]Oh, it's artillery.
[345:40.88]Fuck.
[345:43.40]You got two artilleries shooting at me?
[345:45.82]Fuck!
[345:47.88]Oh my god.
[345:49.80]I don't even want to watch this.
[345:55.70]Every other video game that they've ever made in the last, like, seven years has been the worst game I've ever seen.
[346:00.50]What?
[346:00.60]What am I talking about?
[346:07.65]The Call of Duty Modern Warfare was good.
[346:10.96]Black Ops was kind of fun.
[346:13.40]Every other video game that they've ever made in the last, like, seven years has been the worst game I've ever seen.
[346:18.20]He's backtracking.
[346:19.88]Look, you have to backtrack because somebody gets really angry.
[346:22.50]Look, if you don't... Don't you know and understand, like, politics and social interaction 101?
[346:27.25]If you say something that you know is going to really piss off a ton of people, backtrace it, reiterate, and say, it's my opinion, but it's not... There were some good things that came from that series.
[346:37.79]Backtrack, backtrace it, and then put some faster tracing.
[346:45.39]know whatever backtrack that's the origination of backtrack where is this crack part
[346:57.28]I don't care.
[346:57.70]You could be smoking crack in your car.
[347:01.06]They don't give a shit.
[347:02.20]If you're saying an illegal meme, though, you're going to get pulled over.
[347:04.40]They'll pull you over.
[347:05.72]They'll check your phone.
[347:06.64]They'll check your browser history to see the things you've been saying in chat rooms and stuff.
[347:12.11]You could have like a pound of crack in your trunk.
[347:14.93]Or literally, you could be smoking crack in front of the meme officer and it's not his jurisdiction.
[347:19.83]I have no idea what that even means, but I guess we found it.
[347:25.49]Hey, anyways, let's finish up the stream ending here.
[347:27.94]Sometimes I feel like another person said this stuff.
[347:33.22]You know what I mean?
[347:35.72]We've talked about this before.
[347:36.84]We've talked about this before.
[347:38.53]We've talked about this before.
[347:39.99]We've talked about this before.
[347:41.47]We've gone over this before.
[347:43.49]We've gone over this before.
[347:44.63]We've gone over this before.
[347:45.35]I've talked about this before.
[347:46.31]We've said this before.
[347:47.15]I've talked about this before.
[347:51.37]I talk a lot on these streams and it's weird to hear a person that I don't even know who that is talking.
[348:00.94]It's weird to hear a point I was trying to make like three years ago.
[348:04.73]I'm like, who the fuck is this person?
[348:10.64]anyways hey thanks for the 500 bits mf doom is to the rap game as germa is to the internet that's you have a wide meme reach but it still feels like for some reason you're the internet's biggest inside joke in a very good way something I've observed deserve more clout for the effort you put into your content um it I don't know I feel like it
[348:38.83]I don't even, I know it's like, this is cliche for me to say this, and I know it's, I'm gonna say it and people are gonna be like, I'm gonna hear your eyes roll into the back of your fucking head.
[348:48.82]You're gonna hit the back of your brain when I say this, and I know it, but I don't, I really like don't care about being famous.
[348:57.86]I just don't, I don't care.
[348:59.01]I know, okay, I rolled all the way back.
[349:06.35]But I just don't... I don't care.
[349:07.67]I don't want to be, like, famous.
[349:10.37]I don't like... That, like, sucks.
[349:13.01]That would... That would actually kind of, like, suck.
[349:16.50]I don't want to be famous.
[349:19.50]Oh, this again.
[349:20.72]I know.
[349:21.30]Alright, we're done.
[349:22.14]We're done.
[349:23.18]I'm over it.
[349:25.80]He just cares about the money.
[349:27.21]He's literally lying.
[349:28.39]No, I don't, like, want to...
[349:32.08]Look, okay, there's like known, there's popular, and then there's famous.
[349:38.81]Famous is, like, almost everybody knows who you are.
[349:43.85]Everybody.
[349:45.17]Like, we're talking like you have maybe potentially been on the Ellen DeGeneres show.
[349:49.80]That's famous.
[349:50.52]Like, you're famous.
[349:51.44]I don't want to get there.
[349:52.88]I don't want to go on the Ellen DeGeneres show.
[349:55.16]I'll embarrass myself.
[350:02.46]Famous kind of seems like, I don't want to be famous.
[350:06.32]Then there's like popular, which you're, you're big and you have a large, super famous kind of popular presence in the space that you're in, right?
[350:16.86]You're like, you're popular.
[350:18.26]Okay, cool.
[350:19.22]But guess what?
[350:19.92]Like the guy that throws the football fucking 80 yards is popular too in his high school.
[350:24.10]And that's whatever.
[350:24.93]And then that guy doesn't become famous.
[350:27.33]I mean, maybe he will.
[350:28.37]Maybe he becomes Peyton Manning and he throws and he can, and he's great.
[350:30.85]And you know, but that's popular.
[350:32.63]But, Ellen is huge.
[350:34.21]Ellen is a couch.
[350:35.73]No.
[350:36.23]No.
[350:36.53]Listen.
[350:37.55]Popular is like you're famous in like a small circle.
[350:42.52]Known is... Oh shit, I did this wrong.
[350:45.10]Popular... Flip it around.
[350:46.66]Popular is before known.
[350:48.08]Known is before famous.
[350:49.66]So popular is you're like cool and people like you and you're in your space.
[350:53.05]Known is... Some people might know who you are, but you're not like famous.
[350:55.99]Nobody cares.
[350:56.95]Famous is famous.
[350:58.09]I like to sit somewhere between, um, like, the six of us at the lunch table.
[351:03.92]And we're all playing Magic the Gathering.
[351:05.98]And nobody fucking knows who I am.
[351:07.28]That's where we are.
[351:16.71]Known, popular, famous.
[351:17.89]German, 985.
[351:19.23]No, no.
[351:19.93]Known comes after popular.
[351:21.94]Because you can be popular, but you might not be known.
[351:25.06]That's what I'm saying.
[351:26.44]Like, the guy that plays high school football, and he's popular, and people know him.
[351:31.15]He would be known.
[351:31.91]Fuck.
[351:32.75]Long story short, TLDR.
[351:34.77]I'll eat a fucking shoe tomorrow.
[351:36.51]Okay?
[351:37.35]Does it make you happy?
[351:46.85]I'm not eating another shoe.
[351:49.41]Probably ever again.
[351:52.53]Tomorrow.
[351:53.01]What if I did that tomorrow?
[351:55.19]Alright, let me try to wrap my brain around the thing I was just trying to say.
[351:58.19]I don't want to be fucking like Ellen DeGeneres famous.
[352:02.76]I don't.
[352:03.02]I don't want to be on that couch like... Hey, Ellen!
[352:07.96]Yeah, well, you know, I just started streaming on Twitch and... Yeah, I'm here now!
[352:14.02]I don't want to do that.
[352:19.24]Okay, I've got five questions for you, Jeremy.
[352:22.66]Ooh, five questions?
[352:23.58]What are they?
[352:25.08]Have you ever eaten ass?
[352:28.08]Oh, shh.
[352:29.78]What are we talking about?
[352:31.28]What?
[352:32.16]No, no, I'm not supposed to get over this when I became famous.
[352:34.14]You're not supposed to ask me that.
[352:35.30]You're not supposed to ask that question.
[352:36.80]I'm supposed to get over this when I'm famous.
[352:39.12]You're not supposed to tell me that anymore.
[352:40.49]Just give me talk about what my favorite car is.
[352:45.37]And I'll beep it.
[352:46.17]I'll, like, beep it behind you.
[352:50.08]My computer crashed.
[352:51.90]No, it didn't.
[352:53.04]Okay.
[352:53.84]Listen.
[352:54.10]I thought my computer crashed.
[352:56.56]What happened was, go to that Octogeddon Oops All Penguins video.
[353:00.12]Go to 20 minutes and 8 seconds.
[353:03.48]Pause the video.
[353:05.62]And then I want you to move your mouse around.
[353:07.26]I have more than one monitor.
[353:09.64]And I move my mouse around, and that mouse is on the screen.
[353:12.45]And I thought the computer was crashed.
[353:17.63]Okay.
[353:19.06]Yeah, it's not.
[353:19.66]My mouse is here.
[353:21.12]He's a nut.
[353:22.10]I'm fine.
[353:22.48]All right, let's go.
[353:23.93]I'll see you tomorrow.
[353:24.55]Goodbye.
[353:24.89]Good night.
[353:25.35]Hey, Selenogist.

[353:34.45]I'm getting a little cold.
[353:35.15]My chest is in the lake.
[353:37.15]Here we go.
[353:37.93]I haven't laughed in a long time and your content is just too good.
[353:40.39]Please take care of yourself and this goes to chat as well.
[353:42.39]Good night and thank you.
[353:43.12]That's just a really nice fucking message.
[353:44.76]Thank you.
[353:45.08]Appreciate that.
[353:47.08]Thanks a lot.
[353:50.85]Hey, Mr. Bob Abouie.
[353:53.71]Thanks for the $15.
[353:54.87]Jerma, awesome stream as usual.
[353:55.97]Check your business email when you have a chance.
[353:57.51]I have not... I have not opened the business... I have not opened my business Jerma email.
[354:05.91]In... I'm going to be completely upfront with you and realistic.
[354:12.32]Probably four to five years.
[354:13.32]Yeah, that's accurate.
[354:21.68]But thanks for the 1500 bits.
[354:23.78]Thanks for the $15.
[354:24.70]Open it on stream.
[354:30.54]No, why would I do that?
[354:31.50]There could be, like, info in there.
[354:34.79]He's famous and he has an agent.
[354:39.13]And then finally, Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[354:41.27]Also, here are some memes you missed during the stream.
[354:47.45]This is fucking disgusting.
[355:15.26]Okay, enough of that.
[355:19.64]I'm actually... Yeah, I missed that one.
[355:21.42]Sorry, I'm missing that one.
[355:25.30]Also, there's another one here.
[355:28.21]This will be Jerma in 2021.
[355:30.57]Dunkin Donuts reward system.
[355:32.71]I don't even have the mental energy to go over this.
[355:56.14]I thought that was shit coming out of his ass.
[355:58.80]And I was about to say, thanks a lot.
[356:02.56]That would be a pretty long shit.
[356:04.30]I don't know, like an arrow pointed at it.
[356:11.37]But then again, there's one more.
[356:14.37]There's one more, apparently.
[356:15.57]This one says, we've all done it.
[356:21.97]All of us.
[356:23.83]Oh my fucking god.
[356:27.53]It's a Twitter video.
[356:28.47]The worst place ever.

[356:31.16]Hold on, let me see if I can get it.
[356:49.09]This should be the source right here.
[356:50.37]Find out.
[356:54.33]I already know what this is and, you know, whatever.
[357:02.53]They say I promise there's no porn you can ban me permanently again if there is
[357:29.57]Also, I was wondering if you could give my uncle Bugleberry some attention and at least let him appear in the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[357:35.62]No.
[357:36.50]No.
[357:39.10]You don't understand the Bugleberry story arc that's coming at you.
[357:44.08]Not anytime soon, but it will.
[357:49.45]Oh, you have no idea.
[357:51.37]You're gonna hate it.

[358:36.02]But, yeah, the most that a stream will be going forward will be somewhere around the five to six hour mark.
[358:42.86]At least for the foreseeable future.
[358:44.06]For the foreseeable.

[360:47.39]It makes me sad.
[360:49.89]I was about to just press the sound of the car alarm button on my keys.
[360:58.33]It just was like, I'm going to press it.
[360:59.47]I don't know why.
[361:00.05]That would have been fucking bad.
[361:01.39]I would have had to just disappear.
[361:02.75]Speaking of disappearing, we're going to raid Rift Tracks.
[361:08.21]How do you spell it?
[361:10.64]R-I-F-F-T-R-A-X.

[361:20.67]All right.
[361:22.53]Here we go.
[361:23.09]I mean, it's a 24-hour channel, so it's not like someone's not going to pop on the stream and be like, What the fuck?
