[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.47]Okay.
[00:04.69]Okay.
[00:06.07]Alright.
[00:06.79]Did you tweet?
[00:07.71]I'm about to.
[00:08.19]Okay, I'm waiting for the retweet potential.
[00:11.61]It's right there?
[00:12.83]It's very boring.
[00:14.50]It's just a basic, boring tweet.
[00:18.36]Yeah, but like, I would have to write my own.
[00:21.02]Alright, so.
[00:25.24]Hey!
[00:28.80]What's up, everybody?
[00:29.60]How's everybody doing?
[00:32.10]Welcome to Elden Ring.
[00:36.94]Which one of us will become the Elden Lord?
[00:39.48]Only one of us can.
[00:40.46]Alright.
[00:45.90]I got everything going.
[00:46.86]Let's open this up.
[00:49.88]Alright.
[00:50.80]We good?
[00:52.28]I think we're good.
[00:52.88]Alright, so here are our two characters.
[00:56.42]There's no intro.
[00:56.96]We're so late.
[00:59.71]I'll do that.
[01:01.31]Well, you need a little bit of intro.
[01:02.81]Alright, here's a little bit of an intro for you.
[01:04.15]There might be some people that, you know, check the VARs, like, I don't even know what this is.
[01:07.56]What are they doing?
[01:09.30]Right, okay.
[01:09.88]So, we have installed... Your mic is weird?
[01:13.36]Uh-oh.
[01:16.24]No, it's not.
[01:18.58]One guy.
[01:20.32]What do you mean my mic is weird?
[01:21.68]Who said that?
[01:23.60]Oh, it's a one guy.
[01:24.15]Okay.
[01:25.63]How is it possible that I could read that?
[01:28.43]Alright, anyways.
[01:29.85]So we have installed right now, we have the seamless co-op mod.
[01:33.65]Which means that we can both be in the game.
[01:37.10]We don't have to do any signs or soapstone things.
[01:40.52]We're just in the game together permanently.
[01:43.66]We also have randomizer on.
[01:45.86]All the randomized enemies that we don't know what they are.
[01:47.97]We have no idea.
[01:48.77]Nice McDonald's voice.
[01:50.35]Time that person off for a day.
[01:51.91]All of the items are randomized and all of the monsters are randomized.
[01:55.53]And I believe even between us, we might have different random seeds for items.
[01:59.23]So what you pick up is going to be different than what I pick up.
[02:01.74]And the way the randomizer worked from the last time I used it is like every time you pick up like the basic Roa Berry, that item is always a different item.
[02:10.18]It's not a different item every time you pick one of them up.
[02:12.38]Like Roa Berry could be Sledgehammer.
[02:15.72]Really?
[02:15.94]So you'll just constantly be picking up Sledgehammer.
[02:18.58]Yeah.
[02:19.26]Yeah.
[02:19.76]I'm Mii Strong by the way.
[02:21.02]This is Mii Strong.
[02:21.96]I told you I promised a Mii Strong playthrough and this is what it is.
[02:25.04]This is Mii Smart inspired by Blanka.
[02:27.84]If I roll, I make lightning.
[02:29.68]You do?
[02:29.96]No.
[02:31.99]Oh.
[02:33.87]Alright, you guys ready?
[02:34.61]Are we- wait, make sure everyone- is everybody here?
[02:36.44]Are you present?
[02:39.02]No, there's a couple people missing.
[02:40.86]Stir is quiet.
[02:42.18]Hold on, I'll fix it, I'll fix it.
[02:43.76]Stir, you're a little quiet, let me turn you up.
[02:46.18]Okay, I'll talk a little louder.
[02:47.90]You don't have to do it, I got you.
[02:49.62]Say- can you say your ABCs real quick?
[02:52.04]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. I have a friend who can't recite the- Kraken can't recite the alphabet.
[03:01.25]Did you get louder?
[03:02.13]Like, how are you not louder for me right now?
[03:04.27]I don't know.
[03:05.66]This is very bizarre.
[03:09.24]I'm turning you up in Discord, but you're not being turned up at all to me.
[03:13.54]Why?
[03:15.12]Pump up the volume.
[03:16.30]Pump it up.
[03:17.44]Pump up the volume.
[03:18.34]Okay, I turned you up as high as I could possibly turn you up.
[03:20.73]I think it's you.
[03:22.19]You think it's me?
[03:23.91]Is that better?
[03:24.57]Because I don't know what's going on.
[03:25.67]What's wrong with it?
[03:28.45]Say your ABCs one more time.
[03:29.86]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. I don't know what's wrong with you.
[03:38.21]What's wrong with me?
[03:39.39]If I mess up, like... Better?
[03:43.53]Okay.
[03:44.01]Alright, let's go!
[03:45.96]Okay, let's go!
[03:49.94]My apologies will come later.
[03:51.71]Oh, that's right.
[03:52.09]You have to go on like a full apology.
[03:54.03]Dude, do you want to fight the boss or do you want to like, I need like full attention to explain the like 10 step program of how I've ruined your day and like how we're never going to talk again.
[04:03.09]No.
[04:03.45]All right.
[04:04.50]Let's let's fight Dracula and then we'll talk about it.
[04:09.32]All right.
[04:10.88]Elden Ring co-op with randomizers.
[04:13.34]I hope you remember the buttons because we kept drinking elixirs every time we went to go open a door.
[04:19.40]I remember.
[04:21.41]Hey, do you think we can beat the tutorial?
[04:22.77]No.
[04:23.99]Do you think we can beat the tutorial boss?
[04:25.55]He's taking like no damage.
[04:28.00]Get good.
[04:35.44]First person to die here has to... I don't know.
[04:39.56]Something funny.
[04:40.16]All right.
[04:43.31]You better queue up something funny.
[04:45.87]First person to die.
[04:47.23]Something funny they have to do.
[04:49.17]Oh, he has to do something funny.
[04:52.37]I've never been funny ever.
[04:56.79]You're supposed to be high right now.
[05:01.55]You don't know anything.
[05:05.92]I'm kidding.
[05:06.50]I'm don't please.
[05:09.44]Wait, is that why you like you left the room before we started?
[05:11.86]You go do like edibles?
[05:13.24]No.
[05:13.68]Weird.
[05:14.22]No.
[05:14.38]Are you like a delinquent streamer now?
[05:15.98]Are you like?
[05:16.37]No.
[05:18.19]What the hell?
[05:19.59]What?
[05:22.72]What happened?
[05:26.23]I'm so concerned.
[05:27.69]What happened?
[05:28.13]I spawned in the tutorial, instantly died, and now I'm watching your character with no health float.
[05:34.87]Just float.
[05:35.57]Just not moving, float.
[05:37.51]Uh-oh.
[05:38.81]Because I'm at a loading screen.
[05:43.76]Oh, yeah.
[05:44.40]All right.
[05:46.54]All right.
[05:46.88]So, here's what we're going to do.
[05:48.64]We're just going to... I mean...
[05:52.43]Maybe this is why they're saying... Wait, wait, wait.
[05:54.19]No, no, no.
[05:54.47]This is normal.
[05:54.91]This is normal.
[05:55.47]This happens.
[05:55.91]This is normal.
[05:57.13]This is fine.
[05:58.21]We just have to restart.
[06:01.11]This is fine.
[06:01.71]You're going to touch a shrine or... I think we have to restart the game.
[06:06.36]No, go through the tutorial and rest at one of the bonfires.
[06:08.66]Yes.
[06:09.08]Okay.
[06:09.36]All right.
[06:09.66]All right.
[06:10.18]All right.
[06:10.82]Everybody just chill out.
[06:11.62]We're good.
[06:12.78]Everyone just chill out.
[06:15.48]Chill out.
[06:15.94]Everything's fine.
[06:18.77]All right.
[06:19.01]We're just going to exit.
[06:20.19]Okay.
[06:20.65]Yeah.
[06:21.19]There is always League of Legends to, if this doesn't work.
[06:24.78]I'm not playing League of Legends.
[06:26.24]Okay.
[06:26.54]All right.
[06:26.82]So just open the game up.
[06:28.22]There's no problems at all.
[06:29.78]Like there's not a problem.
[06:30.36]Just the more that we focus on the negativity, the more that it's going to cause a problem.
[06:34.84]So just open it back up.
[06:37.10]Get to a spot.
[06:38.46]Were you closing the game?
[06:40.14]I was stuck.
[06:41.93]Oh, I'm stuck too.
[06:42.89]Yeah, I would just restart it.
[06:44.27]Get out to that first bonfire.
[06:46.38]The one with, you know, when you see the big open area.
[06:49.48]Just relax.
[06:50.02]Yeah.
[06:51.42]I had been told that you had to get to the first bonfire.
[06:54.40]And now I see why.
[06:55.18]Okay.
[06:57.49]Alright.
[06:57.95]Just... That's alright.
[07:02.09]Okay.
[07:03.95]Everything is good to go.
[07:06.09]just opening it again relax I know a lot of people are like oh my god not like this everything's everything's going exactly that is not like this right that all that's all over we've all okay so originally we were gonna start when my food got here and I finished eating because we didn't want to get interrupted right and then my my food delivery man texted me saying hold on I need to restart my car uh because I because he was parked at the food place for like an hour um
[07:37.93]So that's part one of why it was definitely my fault.
[07:41.63]My food was about an hour and 15 minutes late.
[07:44.58]And then also I tried to make everything easier for Jerma and tried to set some of this stuff up yesterday.
[07:50.10]And I was a little confused.
[07:52.68]I was like, I'm going to send you these files.
[07:54.92]And everything that I did and everything I told him to do was wrong.
[07:57.88]Until at the very end, we were just like, fine, let's do it.
[08:00.89]Just go through the steps, just follow these steps.
[08:02.99]And then everything worked.
[08:05.19]But I tried like three different ways to give him a shortcut.
[08:11.93]You were trying to make it so easy.
[08:14.77]Yeah.
[08:15.05]So easy.
[08:15.65]And it ended up being so difficult.
[08:18.87]I made everything significantly harder.
[08:23.05]Okay, so... I think I'm ready... I think I'm ready to... Are you at that first... Like the one before you open the door.
[08:32.18]The first bonfire that you can actually touch, right?
[08:34.63]yeah um in the basement at the bonfire with the knife okay I'm gonna turn you up a little bit more because I people are saying you're still a little quiet I can turn myself up a bit as well does that help talk say some stuff a b c d e f g h I j k l m l p that's is that better we're good to go right is that good way better perfect
[09:02.08]All right.
[09:02.34]Cool.
[09:02.72]All right.
[09:03.08]All right.
[09:04.14]Yeah.
[09:05.46]Oh, yeah.
[09:07.26]Yippee.
[09:09.08]All right.
[09:09.28]I'm coming in.
[09:09.68]Are you ready?
[09:11.10]I'm ready.
[09:11.96]I hope.
[09:12.38]So you're at that first site of Grace.
[09:16.13]I am turning this on.
[09:18.59]I am at the first site of Grace.
[09:21.11]Yes.
[09:23.25]Oh, you can't see.
[09:23.91]I'll turn it on.
[09:28.20]I can't contain it.
[09:29.12]I'm so excited.
[09:29.62]What the fuck was that noise?
[09:31.20]What?
[09:31.34]What?
[09:32.90]like someone did a drive-by on you what like I thought I just heard like a machine gun firing no all right I'm that does sound like a bird in your room can you pick up this item there's an item here what is it so is it something weird oh dude why did I get so much stuff
[09:59.49]sacred relic sword ash of what did you get all these things I got I got a ripple blade and a smithing stone dude I got all right our items are not the same by the way but I got a lot of cool stuff I can't even use it yeah I can't equip it okay well whatever we have randomized loot does that who cares
[10:25.33]Yeah, it's going to be a rough start before we can, you know, get something we can actually use.
[10:30.55]That's an endgame weapon.
[10:32.41]That's an endgame boss weapon.
[10:34.17]Yeah.
[10:35.41]All right.
[10:35.87]The big kicker is, is this thing out here the same for both of us, right?
[10:41.11]Well, the tutorial guy was already the same.
[10:43.35]So I think that's settled.
[10:45.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:46.76]Come back here.
[10:49.63]Okay, let's do a bit.
[10:50.55]No, no, no.
[10:50.94]I'm just saying like, it's been a while since I played this.
[10:53.00]Remember the first time you opened this door?
[10:55.20]You went like this?
[10:56.00]Did you do this?
[10:57.22]I did.
[10:57.50]I was like, holy shit.
[11:00.84]You know what I the first thing I did is I walked out here, I saw the night.
[11:04.40]And I said, Wow, I've seen I haven't seen anything in this game other than a whole bunch of streamers waste their time fighting this for three hours at the start of their streams.
[11:11.26]I'm not gonna bore you guys with that.
[11:12.76]And I'm gonna walk by it.
[11:14.22]That's what I did.
[11:15.51]David, you're the type of player that opens the Wikipedia page the second you install the game.
[11:19.37]I don't!
[11:19.63]I didn't!
[11:20.29]No, I just... That was the only thing I knew, is that I didn't want to fight that enemy for like two hours.
[11:25.52]There's always one Dark Souls enemy in the beginning that everyone's like, oh, I can beat it.
[11:29.08]And then they can't fucking beat it, and they can't own up to that.
[11:32.32]You didn't beat it, right?
[11:33.18]How long did you fight it?
[11:34.12]Who is this, by the way?
[11:35.22]Is this still the same character?
[11:38.63]uh yes but I think they're what they're wearing is randomized so they look different okay did you touch this touch it let's take a little nap all right so by the way keep in mind if either one of us sits at a bonfire it resets the whole game so we have to be we have to okay what's that that's a tree spirit right yeah okay so all right what do you want to do um well I
[12:08.28]I think, I mean, I know exactly what we should do, but I want to leave it to you so we don't have another Terraria moment.
[12:15.89]I mean, I don't think there is a Terraria moment.
[12:18.63]What's this?
[12:19.03]Ooh.
[12:20.99]Oh, that's normal.
[12:23.57]No, that was different for me.
[12:25.07]I mean, we have to go get the horse, right?
[12:27.93]Something was different.
[12:28.91]Yeah, so, okay.
[12:30.55]The first thing you do, you got to run up to the church and rest there.
[12:34.98]Yes.
[12:35.26]And then you run to the other bonfire and then you get the horse.
[12:37.44]Get the horse.
[12:39.53]But like, I don't see it.
[12:40.96]Like, I already feel like I'm dragging you.
[12:43.22]No, no, no, no.
[12:43.92]That's what I would have done.
[12:44.62]Okay.
[12:46.18]Well, I need you to say what you're going to do.
[12:47.94]And then, like, I want to be like, you're the strong one.
[12:51.06]And I trust you.
[12:52.15]So you should do magic then.
[12:53.29]You should be like a magic user.
[12:54.37]And I should be like the two-handed weapon user.
[12:56.55]Yeah.
[12:56.95]Like, ideally, if I can find magic.
[12:59.87]Also, everything the merchant sells should also be randomized.
[13:04.34]Really?
[13:04.76]Ooh, a golden rune.
[13:07.74]Ooh!
[13:10.19]What's up?
[13:10.55]Look at that.
[13:11.29]I have a tunic.
[13:12.57]Okay, what do you got?
[13:13.37]Yeah, this is a bunch of random shit.
[13:14.65]Kindred of Rot Ashes?
[13:36.23]I don't even know what the hell I want to do yeah and one of the settings that I had enabled should exist um the notes that they sell I think are hints to key items in case we can't find one you can buy the notes from them and they'll be like hey did you know that like the great ruin is actually here take the giant's flame how about a screw up your game
[13:59.92]What?
[14:00.50]Where?
[14:01.44]Oh, you rested.
[14:02.20]The NPC disappeared when you rested.
[14:05.56]I was like, Oh, no, I'm super paranoid that like something else.
[14:09.04]I know.
[14:09.76]But whatever.
[14:11.20]Look, it's a bunch of fucking mods.
[14:13.02]It's gonna be problems, right?
[14:14.60]Okay, well, then we got to go up the road to the next bonfire so we can get our horse and also
[14:21.89]pick up any items we find so is every single enemy is randomized so that means that the random kind of tarnished that are walking around could just be like millennia I believe so yeah and they should be scaled if they're if it is a boss it's scaled down this is still just a goat this is still wait oh there's a hand they are scaled all right that's funny
[14:53.15]Great dragonfly head.
[14:54.41]That's so stupid.
[14:59.08]I think the goats and stuff might not be randomized because they need to be... I don't know.
[15:05.34]All the animals aren't?
[15:06.68]They're like not enemies.
[15:08.30]I don't know.
[15:09.70]Put it on?
[15:10.10]I don't think I've ever even seen that enemy in the game.
[15:24.47]All right, so we need to go... Wait, I can't open my map?
[15:29.91]Because there's enemies targeting us.
[15:32.11]That flower is trying to kill us.
[15:33.43]Are you serious?
[15:34.07]All right, well, it's scaled, right?
[15:36.61]Yeah.
[15:40.37]They still take a million hits.
[15:43.96]What's that?
[15:45.82]Electricity!
[15:48.56]I forgot.
[15:49.48]I forgot.
[15:49.78]It's all right.
[15:51.28]We'll get there.
[15:52.28]Just stand on the poison.
[15:52.92]It doesn't matter.
[15:53.28]Just kill it.
[16:09.50]Are you dead?
[16:10.06]I thought I killed you.
[16:11.64]That scream made me think I was dead.
[16:15.49]Stagger!
[16:16.27]Stagger!
[16:17.31]Stagger!
[16:17.75]I didn't know you could stagger the plants.
[16:22.09]Jesus Christ!
[16:25.78]Okay, so what do we get for that?
[16:30.10]Slumbering egg and an octopus ovary.
[16:34.24]I got trash.
[16:35.38]Let's get the bonfire in here.
[16:37.42]Oh, yeah.
[16:38.08]So we can be unpoisoned and we'll go the other way.
[16:42.54]Do you think we'll beat the first boss?
[16:45.82]I mean, the first boss could just be like a bandit.
[16:50.15]That's very true.
[16:53.23]Why are you still poisoned?
[16:55.57]uh I'm not you you to me you look like you're a poison as well oh okay let's just run we gotta get we gotta go get our dog somebody said we might have to restart the game one more time after this cutscene okay somebody said stinky yeah you just have like the sims uh like hygiene is zero right now well
[17:25.20]It's kind of what it's like.
[17:26.02]All right, let's see what happens.
[17:37.71]Are you just going to skip this?
[17:39.25]Yeah, I skipped it.
[17:40.61]You're sitting on the ground stinking for me.
[17:45.47]Okay, I'm talking.
[17:46.87]Accept.
[17:55.53]I didn't even get to talk to her.
[17:57.07]Oh, you didn't?
[17:57.55]No.
[17:57.73]Do you see me walking around?
[17:59.33]Yeah, you're just kind of walking around.
[18:01.57]All right, what happens if you sit down?
[18:06.02]I mean, I got the cutscene, but I didn't get to talk to her afterwards.
[18:09.48]Oh, there is the talk to Melania option.
[18:12.34]It like did an auto trigger.
[18:13.66]How do we make it so we don't smell?
[18:16.22]I kind of like the stink.
[18:18.48]I kind of feel at home.
[18:30.20]okay I don't want to look at that the whole time we play I bet you if you die it'll be gone maybe I mean you're stinking for me but I'll I'm okay with that I don't mind isn't it's not a big deal how do I how do I get to that there it is no don't do that I wonder okay switch this too
[18:59.08]All right, Commander, what do we do now?
[19:01.84]All right, now open world.
[19:03.30]We can go anywhere.
[19:04.32]Get on your horse.
[19:06.92]I forgot how to do that.
[19:08.97]I got to equip it, right?
[19:12.53]So we need to like level up.
[19:15.10]Let's clear out this camp.
[19:16.02]We need to find some items.
[19:17.20]Wait, how do you... Jesus, how do you bookmark an item?
[19:21.14]Okay, so hit start.
[19:22.26]Just do the regular start menu.
[19:23.44]Go use your D-pad to go all the way to the right.
[19:26.31]This is where I put it.
[19:27.09]It's over in that pouch menu.
[19:28.35]You hit Y to switch, and then you hold Y to get to that sub-menu.
[19:32.31]That's how I do it.
[19:32.93]Okay.
[19:44.18]Okay, I'm remembering.
[19:45.69]That's the last.
[19:46.83]See, I've... Yeah, we've all played this game, but it was like three years ago.
[19:52.63]This feels like a while, doesn't it?
[19:55.27]Alright, so what's in the box for you?
[19:59.40]Oh, you don't stink anymore.
[20:01.18]Oh, good.
[20:02.54]Godskin Peeler.
[20:04.52]Got a perfume bottle.
[20:06.98]Dude, all this shit just takes... I don't... That thing's not bad, isn't it?
[20:12.83]That thing's, like, really good.
[20:15.09]I need 17 strength and 22 dexterity.
[20:17.97]Oh, we need to establish a rule right now because we're finding different items.
[20:21.29]Are we allowed to drop items for the other person?
[20:24.58]Like, if I find a two-hander and you're like, oh, dude, I want that.
[20:27.86]Right.
[20:28.10]What do you guys think?
[20:30.10]I would say no.
[20:31.50]Unless it's, like, essential.
[20:34.94]Let's get a pull-up, I think, because I'm seeing it's very mixed.
[20:38.21]It's no, yes, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:41.23]We'll see.
[20:43.97]In the meantime... Alright, let's... We have a problem.
[20:53.12]This person has a bunch of runes.
[20:53.98]I thought they were supposed to scale.
[20:57.32]I thought the enemies scaled.
[20:58.68]I mean, they do, but... What?
[21:01.45]Why does he have so much health?
[21:09.37]What's the ash of war with this thing?
[21:16.25]Our weapons just suck.
[21:17.27]Like, I'm on a dagger.
[21:18.71]That's true.
[21:21.33]I'm going to die.
[21:21.87]No, you're not.
[21:26.89]I can't believe we're already fighting the first boss.
[21:30.04]This sort of is, if you think about it.
[21:31.96]It really is.
[21:39.94]He's just so fast.
[21:46.95]All right.
[21:47.15]What do you actually want to play as?
[21:48.44]Because we need to figure this out.
[21:50.02]I got to find something.
[21:51.22]I want to play magic.
[21:52.10]Skip it around.
[21:55.90]This looks so weird.
[21:57.04]You're kind of like boarding around a little.
[21:58.68]All right.
[21:59.76]We got it.
[22:00.06]Ooh.
[22:04.89]They didn't drop anything.
[22:13.39]Me strong.
[22:15.63]The priest.
[22:17.29]I feel like you're just, you're getting things.
[22:19.91]Yeah, my game's really fun and yours doesn't sound very fun.
[22:23.55]I've started on not fun mode.
[22:28.98]I have enough to level up.
[22:30.18]We should probably do that.
[22:31.46]Well, you're going to respawn that fucking boss enemy.
[22:35.58]Yeah, but I mean, we need to level up.
[22:36.82]We're fucking awful.
[22:37.64]Let's clear this area.
[22:38.68]I think I actually have the stone shard starting item to open up the door and we can try and get random items.
[22:43.69]I think this map item is also probably random.
[22:48.31]Just don't die.
[22:49.29]Okay, I'm going to pick up this map item.
[22:51.43]Okay, it is a map.
[22:53.89]Alright, I got it.
[22:54.41]Are you dead?
[22:57.90]Oh.
[22:58.82]One of the god skin bosses is right here, so I don't know what we need to do about this.
[23:05.26]Should we run or should we fight it?
[23:06.18]I am still naked with a dagger.
[23:09.34]I can take it.
[23:12.76]I am a cleric.
[23:14.66]I have no flasks.
[23:19.59]I'm the smartest caveman.
[23:20.85]Alright, I'm going back and sitting at the bonfire.
[23:25.15]Are you coming?
[23:27.93]Sure.
[23:28.77]Sure.
[23:29.32]This is aggroed onto us right now.
[23:31.14]Well, then do it.
[23:34.52]What happened to you?
[23:36.86]Nothing happened to me, but everything reset.
[23:39.48]Alright, this is important.
[23:41.26]Give him your armor.
[23:41.96]Well, he has to ask nicely for it.
[23:43.32]Yeah, what was the pull?
[23:46.45]Overwhelmingly, yes.
[23:48.39]To share items.
[23:49.19]Yeah.
[23:51.43]That honestly surprises me.
[23:53.07]I mean, I think I have to do strength.
[24:04.81]Make this bearable?
[24:05.71]Well, I mean, we can also just drop, like, endgame boss weapons.
[24:11.63]Okay, do you want gear here?
[24:13.37]How do you drop something?
[24:14.37]Here, now follow me.
[24:15.39]Okay, this is my one directive.
[24:17.85]Okay, this is... You're following me.
[24:18.92]I'm going to follow you.
[24:19.46]Get on your horse.
[24:20.42]I'm on it.
[24:20.70]Let's go.
[24:22.73]We ride.
[24:23.23]Okay.
[24:26.37]Watch out for the jelly.
[24:30.04]You know all the, like, uh, the graves?
[24:33.78]Yeah.
[24:34.04]That have a whole bunch of pickable, like, runes that all, like, there's, like, ten runes on a whole bunch of... Well, market.
[24:38.97]We need to market.
[24:39.55]We gotta play like... I'm not... I kind of remember how to get there, but I don't remember where it is on the map.
[24:45.15]You sound like a dad.
[24:48.49]Like, oh, yeah, I know where it is.
[24:50.48]Do you?
[24:51.75]Yeah, of course I do.
[24:52.89]I don't know where it is, but I know like the general area.
[24:54.59]I don't want a map.
[24:55.77]Hey, watch out for this giant rolling ball.
[24:57.40]You don't want to get squished by the ball.
[25:03.10]I think we should look at the map.
[25:04.10]Who needs a map?
[25:04.78]I don't want a map.
[25:06.14]I don't know how to look at the map.
[25:08.78]Watch this.
[25:10.04]I do.
[25:21.21]I mean, I'm in combat.
[25:22.19]Do you know what they look like on the map?
[25:23.47]They're like little rectangles.
[25:31.75]I mean, I'm pretty sure I know where I'm going.
[25:38.88]Do you?
[25:42.10]Yeah, let's get this bonfire.
[25:50.34]Ooh.
[25:55.75]I am without maiden.
[25:57.55]Okay.
[25:57.93]Setting down.
[26:02.54]What about the painting?
[26:05.20]Oh, I got death root from the painting.
[26:06.62]Dude, it's a random item.
[26:08.32]I got an ancient dragon smithing stone.
[26:10.98]All right.
[26:14.01]I'm still following.
[26:14.67]You seem to know where you're going.
[26:15.75]I'm lost.
[26:20.83]You really are, aren't you?
[26:21.93]Tell me the truth.
[26:22.63]No, it's this way.
[26:25.58]Tell me the truth.
[26:27.10]I'm not lost.
[26:28.16]If I were lost, I'd say so because I wouldn't want to derail any further than I have today.
[26:34.44]No.
[26:34.74]Okay.
[26:34.96]You're right.
[26:35.30]You got it.
[26:38.54]No, you had it right here.
[26:39.90]Right here.
[26:40.46]So let's just loot up.
[26:42.68]This feels like cheating.
[26:43.80]I like it.
[26:44.16]Okay.
[26:48.22]Smithing stones.
[26:50.48]Eclipse shuttle total.
[26:55.66]Royal Knight Armor.
[26:57.42]I got the anchor.
[26:58.16]The big anchor weapon.
[26:59.82]I'm going to be able to level up like 30 times.
[27:04.37]Blasphemous Claw.
[27:05.45]I don't even remember what that is.
[27:09.01]Like a throwable?
[27:09.87]What?
[27:12.95]I have a legendary over there, whatever it is.
[27:22.04]Tonic of Forgetfulness.
[27:23.30]Yeah, I got the anchor if you want it.
[27:26.43]remembrance of the dragon lord wait hold on this is oh this is the remembrance that's a lot of souls dude I'm gonna be like level 50 right now we're gonna stomp through this game do you want did you get any actual armor
[27:53.22]I don't even know what this item is either, actually.
[27:55.43]No, I still have no armor.
[27:56.80]How do I drop something?
[27:59.85]I, man, you know, I, the poll said yes, but my, my heart is still saying no.
[28:04.77]Your heart says no.
[28:05.81]Okay.
[28:07.17]Yeah.
[28:08.92]I thought I was naked.
[28:10.20]I thought this dick was right there.
[28:12.60]I was like, oh my god.
[28:13.72]Oh god, don't look, don't look.
[28:15.30]Oh, that reminds me of a story.
[28:16.74]I was, uh, I was getting the mods yesterday, so I was looking through the Elden Ring mod nexus.
[28:20.73]Uh-huh.
[28:21.31]And I was just scrolling down to see other popular mods, if there's anything else we could do.
[28:24.47]Oh no.
[28:25.31]And then one came up.
[28:26.91]And I was like, that's weird.
[28:29.27]better nude model what objectively makes a nude model better than the other nude model and I clicked to open it and then my wife walked in the room behind me and was like what is that somebody said don't scroll on nexus mods yeah seriously popular mods you scroll down once and it's like do you want the naked doll the purple blue doll girl
[28:55.25]We can also do that because it's nighttime.
[28:56.72]If we go back to that bonfire, I forget how that works.
[28:58.60]You like rested it and she's like, oh, and you need that for the spirit things.
[29:02.60]But I imagine we're not summoning because we're already two people.
[29:05.12]All right.
[29:05.48]We've gone.
[29:06.12]Let's let's teleport back to that church.
[29:12.27]Church of Ella.
[29:16.33]Right.
[29:16.89]Because then we'll probably get the cut scene.
[29:18.23]We can.
[29:18.55]I'm going to level up like 30 times.
[29:21.27]Oh, it's a vote to warp.
[29:22.86]Oh, that's cool.
[29:30.21]yeah she was totally nude but also she's a doll it doesn't make sense warping takes forever for the non-host by the way okay that's all right yeah I'm already talking to her don't forget your helmet I think she'll also give you a random item she gave me a fire of blossoms
[29:59.77]okay now it is thine to do as thou wishest all right I have the spirit calling bell and I have a death root I she's not even here but I don't think it really matters all right I'm gonna level up like 15 to 30 times okay I'm going to get one level I can't level level three it really looks like your dick's out dude I know but you didn't get any runes
[30:27.56]No.
[30:28.62]How come I'm getting so many of these and you're not getting any?
[30:31.38]Well, I got, I got this weapon.
[30:34.14]Both of me, I guess.
[30:39.74]You want to, you want to go up to the little starter zone cave with the mini boss in it?
[30:44.15]It's right here.
[30:46.99]Yeah.
[30:48.17]Oh, let me talk to Melania.

[31:34.85]You deleted it.
[31:35.81]Hold on a second.
[31:37.97]Hold on a second.
[31:39.19]Hold on.
[31:39.51]Let me do this.

[32:09.05]We're going to win.
[32:09.71]I'm telling you, we're going to beat the game.
[32:12.86]Well...
[32:17.94]It's alright.
[32:18.28]You just hang out and tell funny stories and I'll beat the game.
[32:20.90]No, that's fine.
[32:21.38]You say that, but let's go down here.
[32:23.28]Have the final boss of this area be like, I don't know, Malakath or something weird.
[32:28.62]Wait, rest at this side of Grace.
[32:32.38]Just in case you die.
[32:33.84]Well, just in case you die.
[32:34.58]Well, then you can respawn at the stake.
[32:38.10]No, you can't.
[32:40.36]You cannot.
[32:40.88]Not in seamless co-op.
[32:42.10]They removed that.
[32:43.52]Really?
[32:43.82]I thought we had the options when we tested it earlier.
[32:45.62]You didn't read the patch notes.
[32:49.46]Dude, don't you wish you could, like, just walking down here, don't you wish you could delete your fucking memory and play Elden Ring again?
[32:54.02]You have no vigor and you've ruined the scaling.
[32:56.37]Whatever.
[32:58.61]What's this shit?
[33:03.47]Oh, what's that?
[33:03.95]Oh, actually, it's not that good.
[33:10.34]Actually, pretty good.
[33:11.08]Actually, pretty good.

[33:38.30]Oh, nice, dude.
[33:39.20]I got something cool.
[33:47.55]Isn't it funny that the one thing I did find I was going to give to you?
[33:51.11]The long sword.
[34:01.75]he's gonna play easy mode hey you when you take you take it if you can get it right I'm sorry but if I get like one of the late game remembrances in the first five seconds I'm gonna do it pants off what the we don't even have a lantern by the way yeah I know well I'm ready did you get this item what wait do you actually want to do magic because I just got stuff
[34:30.99]I can do magic.
[34:32.79]I don't want you to drop it for me.
[34:34.37]I would love to get to the end of the game and like you're in full golden armor and I still haven't gotten like a shirt.
[34:41.97]Like we can handle all your fat rolling.
[34:44.27]Whatever.
[34:44.63]Who cares?
[34:45.07]I'm unstoppable.
[34:47.73]Okay.
[34:47.89]Well, it's cracked.
[34:51.21]All right.
[34:51.47]So this is the first little mini boss, right?
[34:53.77]Yeah.
[34:55.21]Okay.
[34:56.77]All right.
[34:58.79]Oh, this actually is actually really bad.
[35:00.95]It's actually kind of an inappropriate room.
[35:15.08]I gotta remember how this fight works.
[35:21.48]I hope you deal damage because I don't.
[35:28.53]You're doing fine.
[35:28.95]Alright, back it up, back it up.
[35:37.33]Hey!
[35:39.25]Ugly!
[35:39.61]Look at me!
[35:42.69]I tried to pull it.
[35:43.45]Didn't work.
[35:52.34]Uh-oh.
[36:00.89]I don't think we're going to do this.
[36:07.06]He one shot me.
[36:07.94]You dead?
[36:08.50]It looked like he was attacking you and he spun all the way around.
[36:11.42]All right.
[36:13.26]Are you spectating me?
[36:15.06]Yeah.
[36:15.87]You got this, dude.
[36:16.75]You're unbeatable.
[36:18.67]I've heard you're unbeatable.
[36:21.65]Find out.
[36:36.10]What?
[36:36.44]I dodged it.
[36:48.57]I feel like you're actually doing less damage than I was.
[36:50.79]I am.
[36:51.29]Because you haven't gotten a weapon.
[37:10.89]Oh, fuck!
[37:12.71]Fuck!
[37:13.71]Fuck!
[37:16.81]I thought he was me strong, but he was me weak.
[37:22.70]Okay, so what's happening?
[37:24.76]Somebody said I fucked up my whole character.
[37:26.56]Do you think we can do it?
[37:30.24]I think we can do it.
[37:33.88]It's doable.
[37:34.59]It's a little rough for me because I'm level three and I have no vigor or armor.
[37:43.19]go we can do it okay one more try one more try let's just run downstairs because these items are gonna be the same oh that's right well actually if we kill if we kill people they might be different right all right this idiot is over here I'm just going down yes technically if they drop different stuff all right I'm going in
[38:11.00]What technicality?
[38:12.08]Okay, I'm coming.
[38:13.54]You doomed him by overleveling.
[38:17.74]Oh, because the creature is scaling to you?
[38:20.01]Wait, why?
[38:21.59]Because the random enemies do scale.
[38:23.95]I don't know.
[38:24.65]I don't know.
[38:24.97]Your chat.
[38:25.41]I think they might just be saying words.
[38:27.61]I don't think your character's bricked.
[38:31.19]I think you're doing great.
[38:32.69]Okay.
[38:33.93]Well, let's go.
[38:38.46]Hey, guys.
[38:40.29]Let's game.
[38:41.47]Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[38:47.77]Being extra careful.
[38:51.89]Because he might just fucking 180 degree spin and aggro at me.
[38:57.21]I'm cutting off his tail, dude.
[39:01.59]Uh oh.
[39:04.06]Oh shit.
[39:08.18]Oh, come on.
[39:08.76]Really?
[39:09.24]Doing a roam?
[39:09.88]Yeah.
[39:12.36]Yo, he's just spamming that move.
[39:14.60]He's new at this.
[39:15.50]He's just spamming!
[39:26.30]Uh oh.
[39:27.50]Like that lingering hitbox.
[39:29.56]Cheater, cheater, spammer.
[39:31.43]Are you going to do the crawl again?
[39:39.54]Don't get too greedy.
[39:40.54]You just got so greedy and it's making me fucking annoyed.
[39:43.14]I mistimed my dodge.
[39:44.52]I'm sorry.
[39:47.32]What did he swing at?
[39:48.40]I don't know.
[39:51.22]The room is very small for this character.
[39:57.00]I'm distracting right now.
[39:57.88]You just get the hits in.
[40:01.67]I'm telling you, he's looking at you and I think he's attacking you and he does a full spin on me.
[40:06.17]All right.
[40:06.43]Well, hold on.
[40:07.29]Let's see if I can do this.
[40:07.99]I can't take like one hit.
[40:12.48]My mimic tier's got this.
[40:42.97]I dodged.
[40:44.19]That's what I'm saying.
[40:45.21]Actually, I remember there being like an actual delay on dodge rolls in this game.
[40:52.95]No, that's not the problem.
[41:47.74]He's won, he's won!
[42:20.51]Does this boss have two phases?
[42:23.49]Not a different one.
[42:25.57]Oh, he put OK.
[42:28.53]Fucking.
[42:30.80]No, I guess I got so screwed there.
[42:32.50]He did the fire thing in a bit too many times.
[42:34.68]I I had it.
[42:35.72]I had it.
[42:37.80]Like what can we go get some items?
[42:40.85]Take a little bit.
[42:43.77]I had it too.
[42:47.03]Okay, I'm following you.
[42:48.91]All right, let's get... Let's do... Get on the horse.
[42:57.05]And let's get to... Let's go clear... What the fuck was that?
[43:01.67]All right.
[43:03.67]So we need to get out of here.
[43:04.66]Let's move, like, over here.
[43:06.10]Let's just go down here, clear this out.
[43:09.10]Isn't there... There's a chest down here, isn't there?
[43:11.18]Yeah, we can get that.
[43:12.00]Yeah, let's just play.
[43:14.04]Get it.
[43:14.42]Let's just play.
[43:17.13]Alright guys.
[43:18.67]Today we're doing our just play of Elden Ring.
[43:23.93]Here's the room.
[43:27.84]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[43:28.76]We got... Yeah, I know.
[43:33.38]It's so funny.
[43:33.82]This is literally my least favorite item in any FromSoftware games.
[43:37.20]It's like the... What?
[43:40.53]I don't know what happened to my body.
[43:42.31]My mind just went... I don't know what... I'm...
[43:46.70]What happened to my mind and body?
[43:48.85]Oh, shit.
[43:49.69]It's Bob Tricker.
[43:51.43]He's in the game.
[43:54.35]Dude, don't die.
[43:54.83]Dude, don't die.
[43:55.47]I'll take the hits.
[44:00.15]Shooting at me.
[44:00.57]All right, we have to pull this thing out.
[44:03.00]Pull this guy out.
[44:05.18]You're going to die.
[44:06.42]I got him.
[44:07.36]Oh, nice.
[44:07.80]Oh, God.
[44:13.24]Bob!
[44:15.98]Alright, hopefully you get something out of this.
[44:19.34]Why is there, like, another guy here?
[44:21.20]She fell off the... I killed the wolf, but not the girl.
[44:23.77]Is this an NPC?
[44:24.79]Oh, no, no, no.
[44:25.27]Okay.
[44:27.19]I got some thin beast bones.
[44:29.47]Yep.
[44:29.61]Alright, let's go downstairs.
[44:32.59]This is going to be a big item.
[44:36.57]I hope for your sake.
[44:37.30]I hope for my sake, too.
[44:45.51]We'll just leave him.
[44:48.67]What are you doing?
[44:49.65]Trying to do a backstab.
[44:53.49]That's what we should be doing, man.
[44:54.53]We should be trading off backstabs.
[44:59.24]You can't really backstab the wolf.
[45:02.24]All right.
[45:03.20]Let's see.
[45:12.31]I'm going to let you open it because I feel like you deserve it.
[45:19.63]golden loon a whetstone knife what is that yeah that's for uh that was for the upgrading your weapons you need the knife I think that's always there
[45:29.82]okay what did you get a golden moon three 800 sold point important v I mean v v v important v important what's vv bv important what are you talking who is saying this to you somebody said vv important and they tagged me okay
[45:53.70]Well, let's get the chest in the back here.
[45:55.08]I don't know if you want to fight the Godskin Noble.
[45:57.38]He's probably not that tough.
[45:59.78]I feel like the Godskin Noble will be harder than the worm.
[46:04.09]He should be scaled as a normal enemy HP, not boss HP.
[46:07.77]Oh, okay.
[46:11.09]Smithing.
[46:11.43]So I have a lot of smithing stones.
[46:13.65]Yeah.
[46:14.11]All right.
[46:14.43]Let's see if it's let's see if it's scaled.
[46:29.33]No, it is not.
[46:34.81]Okay.
[46:36.33]Well, we're already doing it, so do you want to just run?
[46:38.27]I think we can get them.
[46:39.33]I actually think we can get them.
[46:40.53]Okay.
[46:40.75]I don't have any healing left.
[46:42.81]Oh.
[46:45.57]And still, I think we can get them.
[46:46.80]You think so?
[46:54.18]I'm dead.
[47:04.27]I'm not.
[47:15.17]This would actually be ridiculously easy if one of us did have magic to just stand around and be the asshole that throws magic at him.
[47:22.50]Oh, God.
[47:23.64]Oh, good luck.
[47:25.70]There's no hope for you.
[47:26.68]I'm alive.
[47:27.28]It didn't kill me.
[47:29.24]I'm alive.
[47:34.97]Level fucking 25.
[47:36.49]Oh, God damn it.
[47:37.43]Don't.
[47:48.05]Thrust weapons, I hate these things.
[47:53.09]Yeah, I'll give you the anchor.
[47:56.03]No, I'll wait.
[48:02.01]I can't reach him and he got you.
[48:09.17]Rot essence?
[48:10.40]Hopelessness?
[48:14.78]Wait, why did I get that?
[48:17.07]Wait, what's going on?
[48:18.41]Sometimes an enemy might fall off the map or something.
[48:21.01]Maybe you just... I don't know.
[48:25.19]I'm dead.
[48:25.85]Shit!
[48:27.47]My actual soul is that I need to be one tenth the level of you.
[48:32.45]Oh, I also did get an item for dying.
[48:35.67]Wait, this thing reduces your... Can I delete this?
[48:44.74]Reduces maximum health...
[48:48.78]It's part of the mod?
[48:50.42]Sit at a grace to delete it.
[48:53.91]What?
[48:55.83]Yeah, I got a weird item bet.
[48:57.95]What's the point if it resets?
[48:59.51]Because if you die, you're out of grace.
[49:02.15]Oh, I don't understand.
[49:06.05]It's balancing for seamless co-op.
[49:11.19]Oh, I get it.
[49:12.65]So if you die, and I try to come back to help you, then it reduces your... to make it so we can't just, like, cheese stuff.
[49:20.23]I see.
[49:21.09]Well, I don't think we should do that anyway.
[49:22.61]No, we're going to try to do this as legit as we can.
[49:25.87]Okay, I want to go grab my runes, and then we can go anywhere.
[49:31.31]Just pick a direction, and we're going to go off into the sunset.
[49:33.79]All right, well, the logical direction is to go just towards...
[49:39.95]margot honest yeah margaret search of the elden ring why is that logical because that's the first area to go to is it though yeah what about the castle to the south I mean we could yeah we could do that okay is that illogical
[50:04.70]trying to remember the thing you just said of hey where are we going is you should pick where we go and then now you're like trying to make me decide somewhere else let's tell me where let's go I'm following you okay you are the commander I am your hairy companion all right um let's go here let's go we'll go so are you sure about that you didn't want to go to a market no I don't think actually I don't think we're ready for that if that's another hard boss we probably can't do it
[50:35.87]Make sure you get this.
[50:43.30]Oh, I see what's going on.
[50:45.62]What do you mean?
[50:47.10]When you touch the bonfire to get it, I auto sit at it because you've already touched it.
[50:52.17]I think you getting the bonfire gets it for both of us.
[50:55.55]Oh, I just realized that I get what people mean now by how I just ruined everything for my character by just spamming everything to strength.
[51:03.35]I need 3,200 runes to level up now, and that's not going to happen for like an hour.
[51:06.69]Oops.
[51:10.53]I see.
[51:15.09]NPC?
[51:16.92]Oh, it's the clothing guy.
[51:20.94]What's his name?
[51:22.26]Bok or something?
[51:25.59]Where is he?
[51:27.19]He's right here.
[51:29.43]Golden Rune 8.
[51:32.45]I've got a pretty fat level up there.
[51:40.64]I don't think I ever helped this guy or came here and got him one time.
[51:44.14]Ever.
[51:45.16]Really?
[51:45.52]He's got a cool story.
[51:49.90]Let me guess how his story ends.
[51:53.82]How do you think it ends?
[51:55.89]Well, it's an Elden Ring NPC.
[51:57.24]He dies.
[52:01.32]Wait, he just gave me something sick.
[52:03.40]Wait, what?
[52:08.50]He gave me throwing daggers.
[52:13.80]This NPC, spoiler alert for those who didn't play, he does not die.
[52:18.38]He can die.
[52:21.69]Right?
[52:21.89]Like every NPC can, but there's a scenario where he doesn't.
[52:27.28]Well, let's cut his head off.
[52:28.18]Because instead of like a ball bearing, he'll drop something else.
[52:33.80]A bell ball.
[52:35.10]I think that in Elden Ring, there's very few things that, I mean, this is like the NPC that you do not hurt.
[52:40.88]All of them.
[52:42.20]You sure about that?
[52:44.38]As a general Elden Ring community, I think this guy is protected forever.
[52:48.12]Like you don't hurt this guy ever.
[52:50.16]Right?
[52:55.42]okay where are we going boss all right okay I just was making sure you understood that before you uh I'm not hurting him he's I'm not doing anything don't kill him please we we can go do his quest if you want you never did any of this do what did you just like run through the game as fast as you could he's the guy that gives you the needle right yeah the sewing needle yeah no I just I think I just happened to miss him
[53:29.72]If I break this, do you get it too?
[53:30.78]Why does this guy have so much health?
[53:33.80]Are you going to... Do you get that?
[53:36.06]Yeah.
[53:36.58]Okay.
[53:40.21]Because this is a Misbegotten and he's pretty late game.
[53:44.61]Not really.
[53:46.81]Late-ish, right?
[53:47.69]This is the Faramazula people, isn't it?
[53:51.88]No, I thought this was the Castle Lord Misbegotten.
[53:55.54]But they might be in both areas.
[53:58.32]No, this is early game.
[54:02.05]Drop a staff, you coward.
[54:07.84]He's more castle.
[54:15.58]Beast blood.
[54:16.10]Uh-oh.
[54:18.28]I thought that was Melania.
[54:19.86]It's like a shit.
[54:22.35]That enemy does suck though.
[54:24.11]It does.
[54:25.19]They're one of my least favorite enemies.
[54:27.27]Well, one-on-one.
[54:28.63]If you beat this enemy, first try, I'll give you $100. $100.
[54:33.72]By the way, you can't take any damage.
[54:36.12]What?
[54:36.34]You just add shit as I run in?
[54:49.19]I can't even get near the guy.
[54:50.69]I'll take care of it.
[54:56.93]Oh, sneaky.
[54:57.74]All right, I'll do it now.
[55:00.66]Oh, now I'll do it.
[55:15.30]I've got the rot!
[55:19.24]And now... Rot!
[55:26.30]I'm actually scarlet rotting and dying.
[55:29.94]I need to get to a bonfire.
[55:31.70]Yeah, this item might be something good.
[55:36.11]I'm dying, dude.
[55:37.35]Dude, I'm dying.
[55:39.35]Dude, I'm dying.
[55:40.11]Well, just go to a bonfire.
[55:41.49]I can hang out.
[55:43.03]Dude, I'm dying.
[55:43.57]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[55:46.97]Dude, I'm dying.
[55:47.95]Just go teleport to the bonfire.
[55:49.69]Why are you running?
[55:50.35]I'm roleplaying.
[55:53.74]You idiot.
[55:58.00]Does that mean what happens now?
[56:00.14]Do I have to die too?
[56:02.71]No, I think I can just rest and then come back.
[56:05.92]Okay.
[56:07.50]Oh, yeah, you did.
[56:08.56]Yeah, you did.
[56:09.26]Okay.
[56:14.12]I think it's different, though.
[56:15.26]Maybe not.
[56:16.02]Oh, no, no.
[56:16.64]Whoa, I didn't.
[56:17.90]Okay, that was weird.
[56:22.58]That guy shouldn't respawn, though, because he's...
[56:26.65]Whatever it is.
[56:28.23]Whatever you did.
[56:29.65]I see you going around, but you're not on a horse.
[56:32.50]Okay, let's just run by these guys.
[56:34.58]This is like a crab.
[56:36.12]This reminds me of, like, the Dark Souls 2.
[56:38.94]When they, what was it called?
[56:40.38]Scholar of the First Sin?
[56:41.86]Yeah.
[56:42.46]Like, I guess we'll put a crab and one of those casters.
[56:46.21]That's just Scholar of the First Sin.
[56:53.89]Yeah, you're riding around on nothing, too.
[56:59.78]That looks so scary.
[57:00.64]It looks like a horror movie.
[57:06.32]What is going on over there?
[57:10.93]What's happening over here?
[57:14.97]Is this giant fighting somebody or is he trying to fight us?
[57:18.55]I think he's trying to fight us but can't get out.
[57:24.06]Dude, there's like giant bugs in here.
[57:33.92]Okay, I think that's a bad idea, so we shouldn't go that way.
[57:38.12]Unless you think we can cheese this.
[57:42.36]I don't think we can.
[57:43.58]I think he's cheesing us by being in there.
[57:47.43]Yeah, this is a strategy for... There is the basement down here as well.
[57:56.35]What about the loot?
[57:57.07]Alright, get the loot.
[57:59.82]Golden... Oh, shit.
[58:00.61]I got good shit.
[58:01.25]I got good shit.
[58:02.27]I got some real good shit.
[58:03.19]I got grumble gauntlets.
[58:04.49]What is a grumble gauntlet?
[58:05.49]All right.
[58:07.55]What?
[58:07.85]Grumble gauntlets?
[58:09.09]Grumble gauntlets is what it was.
[58:10.23]All right.
[58:10.45]Come down.
[58:10.85]I'm down here.
[58:11.25]This is a boss.
[58:12.71]This is a boss down here, though.
[58:16.00]I don't know where you went.
[58:16.68]He's still chasing me.
[58:18.92]Did you go down the hole?
[58:19.86]I went down the hole, yeah.
[58:21.22]Oh, I'm coming.
[58:22.12]We can definitely cheese this, by the way.
[58:23.76]There's no way you can fit down here.
[58:30.42]fill the hole hold on I need a second I I found like some high level runes and uh a good sword I got the golden epitaph was this one of the ones that shoots like magic or this was the holy one oh crucible gauntlets I thought it said I don't know why it looked like grumble like grumble a grumble all right you ready
[58:57.81]I don't want to lose my souls here, but okay.
[59:00.96]I believe in us.
[59:01.62]There's no way we're losing.
[59:02.42]Just don't even come in then.
[59:04.34]I'm coming in.
[59:05.36]It's a mad soldier, dude.
[59:06.66]We're fine.
[59:07.26]It's crazy!
[59:08.26]He's fucking gone mad!
[59:10.02]He's gone mad!
[59:11.40]Alright, good.
[59:20.45]So what is in here?
[59:21.45]That guy was fucked up.
[59:27.98]That's not bad runes.
[59:35.49]Oh, that's right.
[59:38.15]They sell stuff though, right?
[59:39.09]Because their shop will be random.
[59:45.03]I have the lowest amount of intelligence.
[59:46.85]Yeah, we have the lowest amount of intelligence you could possibly have in the game.
[59:49.65]Can you even talk to her?
[59:51.31]Yeah.
[59:52.51]Okay.
[59:58.97]there's still sorceries but are these different I feel like these are the same nah she's selling garbage for me here I'm about to level up good actually might be able to do it all right so uh chat help me out here somebody was saying I can't believe you did that so how do I fix this points index right
[60:28.98]Uh, the Glintstone Blades are intelligence scaling stuff, right?
[60:33.44]I don't want to do, like, full-on caster and cheese enemies, but I could go, like, Glintstone Blade and all that stuff.
[60:40.15]Okay, I'll do that.
[60:43.07]Yeah, Glintstone is, uh, is intelligence.
[60:50.87]Just do health only until you figure it out.
[60:55.50]I've figured 17, intelligence 16.
[60:58.37]I mean, I have 32 strength, so I just have to figure out what the hell I'm doing.
[61:02.89]Dude, you are clapped for the rest of the game.
[61:06.22]We can find the, uh, the respec things.
[61:13.20]I think I have to live with this.
[61:15.16]I just kind of got excited and just put every point in it.
[61:18.74]I think we're out.
[61:22.38]Look, that was fun.
[61:22.84]We're good.
[61:28.31]actually a faith could be fun and I already found the weapon like a faith weapon oh god why is this aggro range so huge I I want to see this convoy and all of the random enemies in it walking together I want to see the parade of every enemy in elden ring that's true uh he's still behind us I don't
[61:55.66]What is this?
[61:57.86]A lobster?
[61:59.85]Wait, what is that?
[62:01.61]Why is it like a lobster tree?
[62:02.91]I don't know.
[62:05.43]I'm not messing with a lobster.
[62:06.55]Yeah, we got way too much stuff following us.
[62:08.93]Imagine you get to the final fight and it's like you have to become an Elden Lord and you go into the arena and it's a lobster.
[62:14.78]That would be awesome.
[62:15.96]No one would have ever beat this game.
[62:18.72]Huge hand.
[62:19.50]Huge hand.
[62:20.42]And it's very fast.
[62:25.20]Look at how fast that is.
[62:27.04]No, oh my god, we disagree so much.
[62:29.46]I hate those things.
[62:30.12]Those things are stupid.
[62:31.42]Like, design-wise, the type of enemy that they are, I like the hand.
[62:38.72]But design-wise, playing against it, the actual mechanics the thing has.
[62:44.87]Fighting it, not great.
[62:46.41]Just saying if you were going to be like, oh, I love it.
[62:51.71]No, I love it punching me.
[62:54.66]Turning into a fist and like ramming me wherever I am.
[62:57.08]I'll do him over here.
[63:01.37]Okay, I'm following you.
[63:03.83]Smithing's done.
[63:04.37]Alright, so let's take a look.
[63:06.07]We're trying to get to this tower over here, so let's just keep going.
[63:09.97]I wonder, those boss, um, the jails?
[63:13.61]We should try to do those.
[63:14.87]We could get some pretty lucky shit here.
[63:17.81]Maybe.
[63:18.29]Alright, this is just a VR chat lobby.
[63:21.74]Like, this is not... Oh shit.
[63:24.23]Alright, go, go, go.
[63:25.63]Keep going.
[63:29.65]Last two.
[63:32.51]Where are you?
[63:33.93]I'm behind you.
[63:37.66]Somebody said, I think that's Alexander.
[63:40.00]Is it really?
[63:42.72]Hey!
[63:44.14]Stop!
[63:44.64]Don't do that!
[63:47.50]I killed the dog.
[63:53.70]With the holy blade of the emperor.
[63:55.70]Alright, so let's see what's in here.
[64:06.90]Who knows, dude?
[64:07.42]It might be Mad Soldier 2.
[64:11.48]I hope it's Mad Soldier.
[64:17.26]Alright, be on your toes.
[64:18.10]It could be anyone.
[64:18.94]Oh, up here.
[64:21.14]What is it?
[64:24.32]It's just a regular ass guy.
[64:26.38]No, this guy is one of the most fucked up people.
[64:30.12]And I got insta comboed.
[64:32.10]Because when he jumps up, you get like stun locked.
[64:37.79]Should I try to fight him?
[64:40.29]Yeah.
[64:40.73]What are you going to do?
[64:42.13]What else are you going to do?
[64:44.71]I don't think he's got that much health, but this enemy sucks.
[65:07.60]Oh, I think he just looks weird because the NPCs have random items.
[65:12.46]I fucking hate... I'm going to go barehanded.
[65:14.53]I'm going to use my bare hands.
[65:15.45]I hate this thing so much.
[65:16.71]I hate thrust items in all these games.
[65:19.77]I'm just using my bare hands.
[65:22.11]I can... A stake?
[65:23.89]No.
[65:24.91]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:25.59]I can give you a weapon.
[65:26.43]I think I found some other stuff.
[65:30.74]You're not desperate.
[65:31.94]No, I'm just mad.
[65:33.95]okay he's just mad I don't want to fight that guy he doesn't have that much health we can kill him somebody said why are you playing this again what this is like one of the best games ever like made this game's fun what come on I think we can do it okay yeah I wasn't ready he caught me off guard I wasn't ready
[66:04.99]Make sure you get your souls.
[66:07.77]All right.
[66:08.63]Don't just go right up.
[66:09.41]He's going to do the thing.
[66:10.01]He's going to kill you in one hit.
[66:17.58]There you go.
[66:18.40]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[66:19.08]He's going to turn to you.
[66:19.70]I'm going to do the same thing.
[66:24.30]Get him.
[66:27.19]Turn around.
[66:32.75]You got this, guy.
[66:37.00]This is so unfair.
[66:40.30]Back on the ground.
[66:41.34]Uh-oh.
[66:45.93]Uh-oh.
[66:46.39]He did a weird move.
[66:51.41]I feel like we invaded some poor player.
[66:53.17]And we're just fucking with him.
[66:54.75]He just doesn't get it.
[67:01.26]He keeps trying to do that same move.
[67:03.22]You can't cast spells, man.
[67:04.40]We're in your face.
[67:12.53]He's just, if I get it off, if I just get it off, both these motherfuckers are dead.
[67:22.20]Co-opt.
[67:23.92]Oh shit, I'm going to die.
[67:25.04]All right, we're good.
[67:29.84]We got him.
[67:32.45]honestly he got outplayed yeah he did royal house scroll oh come on a scroll I got a fireproof liver I forget what all that stuff even does I assume fire resistance I'm not gonna I don't want to cast spells well he gave souls we're still leveling you know early game that's true
[68:01.74]Alright, so we did that.
[68:02.66]Let's mark it on the map so we don't forget.
[68:04.16]I'm going to say the sword was completed.
[68:12.03]Do you see that or do you have to do it on your own?
[68:19.47]I don't see it.
[68:22.05]But I'm just going to trust you.
[68:23.76]You're the wayfinder.
[68:27.04]We can keep going down.
[68:28.32]You want to just keep going down across the bridge?
[68:31.61]I'm following you.
[68:33.71]But I'm going to be going like role play speed on my horse.
[68:36.91]We can do role play speed.
[68:38.39]That's fine.
[68:38.69]I'm going to follow you.
[68:46.80]Just getting back to the road.
[68:53.40]Kind of looks like you're speeding up there.
[68:56.42]This is what you would be going if you were... I'm not going full blast.
[69:03.63]I don't know about that.
[69:04.37]Okay.
[69:17.40]Let's cross the bridge.
[69:18.52]Oh, hold on.
[69:19.30]Item up here.
[69:25.78]Oh, it looked like a purple item from way back there.
[69:30.66]fire grease smithing stone I hope the next item you find is a spear sorry but yeah that'd be kind of that would be humorous it'd be comical all right let's go yeah I'm on team comedy
[69:56.23]Yeah, I mean, if you're playing Randomizer, you kind of have to be on Team Comedy.
[70:00.53]Uh, item here.
[70:03.93]Ooh!
[70:05.83]What is that thing?
[70:10.62]That thing is, this thing is like one of the best items in the whole game, I think, isn't it?
[70:14.20]Dragon Crest Shield Talisman plus two.
[70:17.98]It is pretty good.
[70:21.24]Nice.
[70:22.46]Yeah, I haven't found a article of clothing yet.
[70:25.86]No, you haven't.
[70:28.88]Are we going down?
[70:29.58]Yeah, we're just going to go across the bridge.
[70:31.22]Is this death drop here or no?
[70:38.33]Yeah, if you jump down through the wind, you won't take damage.
[70:41.45]Oh, that's all right.
[70:42.05]You're good.
[70:42.63]All right, let's go.
[70:45.27]The wind.
[70:48.31]Uh-oh, that dragonfly ant is arming the ballista.
[70:53.64]Wait, really?
[70:56.22]I thought it was.
[70:56.84]I got a spell.
[70:58.32]I got gravity.
[70:58.88]Well, manning the ballista.
[71:03.66]Edf.
[71:05.82]The fuck?
[71:07.40]Oh, God.
[71:08.08]I'm sorry for angering you.
[71:09.13]Okay, good.
[71:10.21]It was one of the bomb birds.
[71:15.69]These enemies are lazy.
[71:17.78]I think they just have a line of sight that we're just breaking.
[71:21.26]What is on this?
[71:22.24]What is on her head?
[71:23.42]What is this?
[71:23.82]Oh, okay.
[71:25.82]I was like, why is what's like on her head?
[71:29.01]You can't say that.
[71:31.43]I thought it was like, I thought she was a different character.
[71:33.91]Actually, it does look like she's wearing like a flower pot.
[71:44.47]Uh, should we kill her to save the trouble of someone else having to do it?
[71:48.45]Um, I'm not going to make any decisions on NPC killings.
[71:54.43]Looks like you already did.
[71:57.91]You basically, you decide it by not deciding.
[72:01.09]Oh, she kills you.
[72:05.27]Doesn't deal damage though.
[72:12.46]I'm not your father.
[72:14.09]I got I got a helmet it was worth it I got her helmet she dropped it I got a mask finally cool it is I sir knight and they said you sir germa just watched
[72:40.75]I can't hit you.
[72:41.86]I can't stop you.
[72:42.50]There's no friendly fire.
[72:44.08]Yeah, but you didn't tell me to stop.
[72:50.28]That would have been a laugh out loud comedy moment, but I had to get away from it.
[72:56.99]Isn't there an item here?
[72:57.61]There is.
[73:02.41]Oh!
[73:03.19]Oh, it's over.
[73:04.91]We don't lose now.
[73:06.35]I literally just got rivers of blood right now.
[73:12.57]Nice.
[73:18.89]Nice streamer speed.
[73:22.39]Are you fighting everything?
[73:23.21]I just ran up ahead.
[73:24.25]No, I think something died.
[73:25.23]Yeah, but I can't use rivers of blood, right?
[73:35.23]That's lame, isn't it?
[73:36.87]You can use whatever you want.
[73:39.67]But, I mean, like, I physically can't because I have 32 points in strength because I freaked out and pressed the button.
[73:46.66]Yeah, I don't think you can.
[73:47.60]Alright, so down here, we need to find... Where's the map fragment down here?
[74:04.49]I've got the academy key.
[74:06.14]This guy's selling the academy key.
[74:09.58]So I'm gonna buy that.
[74:10.66]Do I have enough to level up?
[74:13.66]No.
[74:16.32]Oh, shit.
[74:16.68]And he's got smithing stone ones.
[74:20.64]Which is very good when I finally get an item.
[74:23.80]So should I put any points?
[74:25.36]I feel like I need to put points in dexterity.
[74:28.96]What did I do?
[74:35.69]No.
[74:36.49]Only Vigor.
[74:37.13]Okay.
[74:37.53]Alright.
[74:41.33]Do not level Dex under any circumstance.
[74:45.11]Okay.
[74:46.49]Receive Bellbearing.
[74:52.08]You can just take it from him?
[75:03.02]He's selling a Sacred Tear?
[75:06.35]I need to buy that.
[75:08.89]Yeah, he sold really good stuff for me.
[75:14.93]And I got the Academy Glintstone, so we can actually go do the thing where you can respec if you absolutely needed to.
[75:19.55]We can go to Lucaria.
[75:22.37]I think it'll be all right.
[75:22.95]As long as I get like a big super heavy weapon soon, I'll be fine.
[75:27.76]Okay, I'm going to rest.
[75:31.20]Did you add a charge to your flask in the very beginning?
[75:34.34]No.
[75:35.42]Well, I would do it because you picked golden seed, didn't you?
[75:38.22]I didn't.
[75:38.62]I picked stone key.
[75:42.89]Why would you pick stone key over golden seed?
[75:47.47]Just to make you mad.
[75:48.73]Just to anger you.
[75:51.15]Can you feel the wall between your brain and your skull?
[75:54.08]No.
[75:55.80]What?
[75:57.30]Oh, you thought I was asking you that.
[75:58.68]No, I was reading that out loud.
[76:01.84]I know, but I'm still confused.
[76:04.60]No matter where that sentence came from, it's confusing.
[76:09.27]Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[76:16.43]There's so much shit.
[76:17.35]I'm like, it's so overwhelming when you, there's so many things to see.
[76:22.47]Did I not?
[76:23.19]Yeah, I did.
[76:23.49]Okay.
[76:24.27]I'm ready.
[76:24.57]I'm going to start RPing.
[76:29.20]Oh, wait.
[76:29.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:30.00]No, no.
[76:30.34]Let's wait until nighttime for the cavalry.
[76:37.53]I'm curious.
[76:38.15]I assume you, like, just can do it and it overrides my game.
[76:42.65]Find out.
[76:45.25]Until nightfall.
[76:45.93]Hit it.
[76:53.06]Uh.
[76:54.52]I don't think it did it.
[76:55.80]I don't think it did it.
[76:56.84]I'm the host.
[76:57.50]Maybe I gotta do it.
[76:59.16]You also sit down while I'm doing it.
[77:00.62]I don't know.
[77:02.12]OK, I'm sitting.
[77:06.20]That seemed to have worked.
[77:07.60]Yeah, chat my chat says host can do it.
[77:09.96]Alright, so where's the night Calvary?
[77:16.96]Well, doesn't this area so I have one of those birds that jumps down at night?
[77:22.82]I think it does.
[77:23.88]Oh, wait.
[77:24.76]It's just the Knight Calvary.
[77:29.08]Okay.
[77:30.12]Did this get rolled into just being the regular enemy that's supposed to be here?
[77:35.67]It could be a different Knight Calvary.
[77:37.19]I don't know.
[77:37.55]I feel like I'm not doing damage.
[77:54.03]Seems to be very tough.
[77:59.50]Oh, you're not on your horse.
[78:14.75]I'm like not hurting him.
[78:16.11]He's also real.
[78:16.89]I don't know, man.
[78:25.50]We're alright.
[78:31.32]I think you're hitting his horse.
[78:42.19]Yeah, you're hitting his horse.
[78:43.29]Definitely.
[78:49.55]Ouch.
[78:56.30]At that lock odd game.
[79:12.96]So uh.
[79:14.60]You want to leave so bad battles, huh?
[79:18.34]I was just thinking like I don't know if there is an Elden Ring to horse battles.
[79:25.20]Sticking with this.
[79:27.20]I mean, we kind of, we're here and we're already hurting him.
[79:31.02]Alright, we'll just get off the horses then.
[79:32.25]And let's fight him one-on-one, 2v2.
[79:34.09]Dude, my camera keeps unlocking him and it's, it's rough.
[80:02.83]Ow.
[80:05.58]Ow.
[80:06.18]Am I dead?
[80:06.54]I think you're okay.
[80:19.31]I just hit the jump button instead.
[80:29.59]Where's he going?
[80:30.43]I don't know.
[80:30.81]He's running.
[80:31.25]I remember the first time I fought one of these and you like feel so proud you get him off the horse and he instantly just summons the horse again.
[80:43.79]Yeah.
[80:46.53]Dude, I want to target him, not the horse.
[80:49.75]Why can I not target him?
[81:05.23]Have you given up?
[81:08.69]I don't want to say yes because I know you're going to be like, C!
[81:12.31]I wanted to give up a while ago.
[81:14.07]There's no C. There's a let's go.
[81:15.71]Alright, get on your horse and let's get out of here.
[81:23.56]You have to hit him until he dies.
[81:25.46]I don't... I don't think you...
[81:33.86]he's still behind us make sure you get the map fragment I got it it's my second ancient dragon smithing stone there's a bug with the mod if you fight on horseback the lock-on will stop working oh that is what's happening to me I was wondering why it was so weird
[82:04.19]All right, where are you heading?
[82:04.91]I don't know.
[82:06.97]I was just looking around.
[82:07.79]I like forgot there was this whole beach over here because I think there's nothing on it.
[82:11.18]Let's go to the beach.
[82:15.40]When are you going to do a screaming stream?
[82:18.38]I did one like a year or two ago.
[82:20.44]I just turned the stream on.
[82:22.21]I just sit there and I just go like.
[82:26.91]And the stream is only like 15 minutes, so I can't really do it for that long.
[82:33.21]you just screamed yeah I just kind of scream and then to get a breather take a sip of water scream again and then it's like my throat kind of hurts I have to stop that's cool I like that what is the it's like this headless person
[83:01.37]Oh, there's something really good here.
[83:02.87]I don't know what it is, but I'm glad we came down here.
[83:09.91]Great ghost glove ward.
[83:11.25]That's the highest glove ward in the game, isn't it?
[83:12.88]I don't know.
[83:16.18]Yeah, it is.
[83:16.64]Okay.
[83:28.11]That was cool.
[83:28.77]Now let's check out this area.

[83:53.36]Dude, I don't know what happened or what's wrong, but my pants and underwear are, like, stuck, adhered to my legs and ass.
[83:59.62]I don't know.

[84:21.43]I don't know.
[84:21.77]Did you bathe in something sticky?
[84:23.01]Did you do like an applesauce bath?
[84:30.25]Isn't there like a place to jump off in the middle?
[84:31.60]Or is that a different place?
[84:35.32]In Dark Souls 2.
[84:43.62]There is a giant up there.

[86:01.38]I'm scared of dog!
[86:04.76]Go out on the road or back in the town.

[86:33.97]Oh, here I am.
[86:38.39]Any secrets in here?
[86:40.34]Oh, I got leggings.
[86:42.00]Wait.
[86:43.30]I don't want to wear pants right now.
[86:45.00]I want to wear leggings.
[86:47.36]Oh, I got the gross messer.
[86:49.14]What is this?
[86:51.63]Gross messer.
[86:52.37]Can I use this?
[86:54.88]How can I not put this on?
[87:00.55]Why can I not use this?
[87:03.47]I can't even equip this in two hands?
[87:13.65]Oh my god.
[87:14.69]Give me a break.
[87:15.87]That thing's a gross messer.
[87:23.66]Two-handing only works for strength.
[87:32.91]Did you do that?
[87:34.13]Yeah.
[87:34.71]Your character just got so much cooler than mine in like 15 minutes.
[87:38.05]I got one sword.
[87:39.61]Yeah, and that's the bug weapon.
[87:41.35]That's one of the coolest swords.
[87:42.83]I was about to use that in my first playthrough.
[87:46.09]Oh, he's jealous.
[87:53.32]Fucking level 30 character over here.
[87:55.30]Ooh, look at this.
[87:58.25]Just mad he put it all into strength.
[87:59.85]I got a bow.
[88:08.43]Is there a boss in here?
[88:09.29]There is, isn't there?
[88:11.45]I don't think... I don't even remember ever coming up this way.
[88:14.19]This is, um... There's a guy at the top, right?
[88:18.30]He's like, me, I am the leader of this place.
[88:20.54]Have you seen my daughter?
[88:22.32]I got a Knight Rider glaive.
[88:24.19]I got a glass shard.
[88:26.61]You want another thrusting weapon?
[88:41.34]That guy didn't even move.
[88:44.80]He was in prison.
[88:50.62]In all of my playthroughs, I never came up here and was always wondering where this guy was and I always missed this.
[88:55.48]You didn't ever come over here?
[88:56.62]I don't know how.
[88:58.69]It's a big game and some things you miss.
[89:02.93]You know, that gives me so much confidence that this game really is as good as it is.
[89:06.89]Because...
[89:09.55]You saying that, how many times did you play through the game?
[89:12.63]At least a few times, right?
[89:14.39]A lot.
[89:14.89]Yeah.
[89:15.31]I played a lot.
[89:16.39]That's really cool.
[89:17.13]The fact that you just haven't even seen this place.
[89:18.61]Yeah.
[89:19.13]Every time I did a new playthrough, I was like, I never saw this before.
[89:22.88]I missed this on my first one.
[89:24.34]We have a... Over there, so be careful.
[89:28.98]I don't... I don't like this situation.
[89:33.12]This actually is not good.
[89:36.23]I'm going... Why did you aggro everything?
[89:37.85]I...
[89:39.78]What are you doing?
[89:40.80]Why did you go through the whole top?
[89:42.52]This is my fault.
[89:43.24]They weren't already walking over to us.
[89:45.86]We could have killed a few of them.
[89:52.98]Oh, my God.
[89:53.78]Thank goodness I can fix this character.
[89:56.42]Oh, my God.
[89:57.30]There are enemies.
[89:58.60]Stir must have done this.
[90:11.60]I think you can only hurt these guys with blunt weapons, by the way.
[90:17.67]Oh!
[90:21.77]You can backstab her.
[90:23.43]But yeah, you might need a blunt weapon.
[90:28.07]We're going to die here.
[90:29.45]We just need to go.
[90:30.09]Okay, follow me.
[90:35.78]Where did you go?
[90:37.14]Don't follow me, actually.
[90:37.82]It's bad to do.
[90:39.36]I followed you, and I'm out of health.
[90:40.59]No, no, no, no, no, because they're back.
[90:42.81]It's a gigantic centipede monster thing over there.
[90:46.55]This is bad.
[90:47.37]They're gassing us.
[90:48.77]They're gassing us.
[90:52.29]Run through.
[90:54.33]I can't see.
[90:55.91]Oh, my God.
[90:56.75]What the?
[90:58.22]Don't go that way.
[90:59.22]Don't go that way.
[90:59.86]I got caught.
[91:00.28]There's no way to go.
[91:05.92]I'm dead.
[91:09.84]one of those like I said I've never been up there ever well um stir there's not that's not what's up there I know but like I don't even know where we're going you ran into a dead end you should know that's a dead end you're a master of this game right okay we're just gonna get back up did you rest again to get rid of your whatever they gave you good idea
[91:38.61]Fix your character.
[91:39.43]Alright, hold on.
[91:40.45]No, I'm not going to do that yet because I feel like it's going to scale all the enemies.
[91:44.69]How would you fix it?
[91:45.61]Because I have a golden rune plus ten.
[91:47.87]And I'm about to level up like five, ten more times.
[91:49.88]Oh, no, I'm pretty sure you can use that.
[91:52.10]I think they're still leveled by the zone that they're in.
[91:54.48]I was saying dumb things before.
[91:58.12]Oh, I thought this was way more than it is.
[92:08.90]There's a boss at this castle, Andy.
[92:13.02]Yeah, we saw it.
[92:13.66]It was Astel, I think, because they were spamming at us.
[92:19.67]No, that's my sword.
[92:29.99]Why are you a dog?
[92:31.41]I thought you hate it when people were wolves.
[92:34.63]What?
[92:39.53]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[92:40.07]We need to figure out where... Where's the progress route to get up to the top?
[92:47.07]You go to the other side of this and you go up right.
[92:49.11]Yeah, okay.
[92:49.67]Alright, let's go.
[92:50.21]Not up the pile.
[92:51.11]We can just... Let's kill these... Somebody said that was so funny.
[92:55.17]Minus two.
[92:55.95]If I get poisoned, I'm going to be so mad.
[93:11.56]There's so much poison dust.
[93:14.92]Did he heal?
[93:25.17]Why is this guy not dying?
[93:32.55]Yeah, you can just run along the side.
[93:33.93]Ignore blob.
[93:41.58]That's funny.
[93:41.94]You got the sleeping rock there.
[93:46.28]Is there normally a sleepy guy there?
[93:49.23]Smithing stone.
[93:50.87]We're getting a lot of those.
[93:56.35]Oh, it's a mog-like enemy.
[94:00.23]These guys are actually horrible, aren't they?
[94:01.58]Oh, no, no, no.
[94:03.42]I thought it was mog-like.
[94:04.42]It's not.
[94:04.62]Okay.
[94:12.67]I do hate those guys, too, with the bow.
[94:15.27]Well, they can shoot you from across the whole game, right?
[94:18.15]Those things, they're so annoying.
[94:22.33]Don't look up.
[94:25.29]Please be respectful.
[94:27.05]I can't.
[94:27.56]What is he talking about?
[94:28.48]Eyes forward.
[94:30.22]I thought you meant that there was something very scary, like a monster or something.
[94:33.62]No.
[94:34.58]It was my bare body that cannot find clothing.
[94:40.27]Alright, we need to be careful here.
[94:41.17]Because there is a gigantic giant up here.
[94:50.96]Item up here too.
[94:52.78]That's so scary.
[94:55.50]I don't think we're going to be able to get to that part.
[94:58.46]They're kind of right in the way.
[95:00.45]Oh, I didn't see the gigantic astal in the sky.
[95:03.35]You didn't see that?
[95:04.03]That's what was killed?
[95:04.67]That's the first time I've noticed it.
[95:07.53]What?
[95:10.29]It is shooting.
[95:11.25]Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[95:14.79]I think this is a run scenario.
[95:17.01]Oh, God.
[95:19.36]Okay, let's pull aggro.
[95:20.72]Pull them back.
[95:21.60]Okay.
[95:24.46]We can kill this giant.
[95:38.84]Okay, is this a run angle?
[95:39.90]Yeah, this is a run.
[95:41.27]Why are we fighting this?
[95:42.67]This is a run scenario.
[95:44.11]It always was.
[95:45.75]And you left me with the fucking guy with the battle axe.
[95:50.79]There's a bar feeder on me.
[95:52.69]Is there?
[95:52.89]I'm learning the names.
[95:56.58]Hide, hide for a second.
[96:00.66]This thing is invincible.
[96:02.16]We're in so much trouble.
[96:04.04]We got to go down here, right?
[96:08.13]Yeah.
[96:08.65]Alright.
[96:09.03]Let's reset them.
[96:14.01]Alright.
[96:15.09]Reset.
[96:16.51]Okay.
[96:16.99]Progress.
[96:20.92]Alright.
[96:23.14]Everything's good to go.
[96:23.80]Sounds good.
[96:30.68]Where are you?
[96:32.01]I went down the rocks.
[96:34.73]Oh yeah.
[96:35.21]Oh, there is a boss down at the beach, right?
[96:37.15]With the, uh, the misbegotten.
[96:41.47]Whoops.
[96:42.11]I, I really did that.
[96:44.76]I really did this.
[96:45.76]I did this to myself and there's the fucking brutal enemy down there.
[96:50.76]Oh, there is that.
[96:51.30]There's a mog like down here.
[96:53.44]This is a run angle.
[96:54.92]Uh, I'm not going to do that.
[96:55.80]I'm going to do it right.
[97:04.59]That just happened.
[97:11.49]What the hell are you?
[97:13.47]Something in my nose.
[97:14.73]I went down.
[97:15.11]I did that.
[97:15.51]I went the right way.
[97:17.15]Okay.
[97:17.45]Well, I'm further ahead.
[97:19.42]The right way.
[97:20.44]Isn't this an NPC?
[97:23.00]Wait, how come I can't tell?
[97:25.26]Isn't this the guy?
[97:37.82]run saved you got a larval tier oh god okay wait um where you're all the way down right I jumped off the side of the bridge to get on the roof uh oh okay you're right there um I want to go up that ladder and get the item that's up there though okay I already jumped down you can do that if you want I'll wait
[98:10.11]I was in a bit of a panic.
[98:14.22]Oh goodness.
[98:16.36]I'm rooting for you.
[98:20.40]Go.
[98:24.57]OK.
[98:28.53]I thought what he came, whatever.
[98:31.21]That ladder is pretty hard to get up.
[98:38.36]Do I laugh like a cartoon character?
[98:40.85]Do you laugh?
[98:43.67]Sometimes.
[98:55.48]Did you respawn?
[98:56.36]I did.
[98:57.64]Oh, you didn't want to spectate me.
[98:59.74]No, why would I want to spectate you?
[99:01.26]Because I could just go up here and get the bonfire up here and then we could have... Okay.
[99:09.97]I thought it was like an honor system where if one person dies.
[99:12.26]Yeah, my game just lagged for a second.
[99:26.79]Come on.
[99:31.26]You're all the way down, right?
[99:33.08]I'm resetting the enemies, yeah.
[99:48.79]That's a bear.
[99:53.15]What?
[99:53.33]Why is there... Well, I thought... Wait.
[99:55.47]Okay, I got a crustacean amulet or something.
[100:04.37]I don't think the bear can get out of this door.
[100:05.89]Alright.
[100:12.29]This is an opportunity for us to kill this.
[100:22.05]I nuked him.
[100:22.61]Nice.
[100:23.73]That thing is so good.
[100:24.95]It really is.
[100:25.92]I should have used it in my playthrough.
[100:29.84]Get off my friend!
[100:31.28]We got Z's!
[100:31.92]This Barus is in the way.
[100:38.99]Are you ever going to play Elden Ring?
[100:42.07]Um, no.
[100:49.36]Absolutely not.
[100:50.16]I was thinking about it the other day during my Scream stream.
[100:54.28]I was sitting there going, what the fuck am I doing, man?
[100:57.29]Like, why am I doing this?
[100:58.05]I'm like trying so hard to be funny and shit.
[100:59.83]And like, I could just be playing Elden Ring.
[101:01.19]Like, I think I was like this eighth or ninth Scream.
[101:05.13]And I'm just like, this is, I'm trying way too hard.
[101:07.73]Wait, did you really do a Scream stream?
[101:09.90]No.
[101:10.96]You thought that was real?
[101:15.02]Something I'm missing here?
[101:15.96]No.
[101:19.51]squad move up all right let's go
[101:46.82]dagger and a cookbook.
[101:53.33]Lame.
[101:59.27]Just do it like you fucking mean it.
[102:04.07]That
[102:16.76]You ever go back here to the secret cave?
[102:20.34]Secret cave?
[102:21.60]I guess it's not really a cave, but back here.
[102:25.96]Is there something back here?
[102:26.74]I think usually there's something relevant back here, like a weird sword or something.
[102:31.68]Really?
[102:31.94]Yeah.
[102:41.07]I don't think I've ever been back here.
[102:42.89]Like a million squid back here.
[102:48.93]That's cool.
[102:50.95]I didn't get anything good, but cool.
[102:52.45]Alright, I got... I think I'm alright.
[102:58.14]This is the slowest enemy I've ever seen.
[103:07.94]And you're waiting.
[103:10.24]Yeah, but...
[103:23.09]I hope the boat enemies summon random dudes and not just the same skeletons.
[103:34.61]I would imagine it's probably something different.
[103:37.85]Alright, what do you think we're going to get in here?
[103:49.78]Um...
[103:53.82]I think we're going to get a... What do you call them?
[103:58.90]The things that you upgrade your elixir with.
[104:01.91]Oh.
[104:03.39]Crystal tears.
[104:04.31]I can't believe how fucking cool this is.
[104:07.95]I wish this was just in the game normally.
[104:11.75]Yeah.
[104:12.27]This is so much better.
[104:13.49]This is a million times better.
[104:17.05]Did you ever play Nioh 2?
[104:18.19]And does anyone know if that actually even has multiplayer?
[104:20.22]Because I've been wanting to... Oh, God.
[104:22.12]It's an actual boss.
[104:22.86]Yeah.
[104:27.73]This is a bad place to fight this too.
[104:30.57]37 damage.
[104:31.23]Oh no.
[104:40.16]Shit.
[104:52.28]Wait.
[104:53.60]Might just walk off the edge.
[104:55.88]Is that possible?
[104:58.15]um I don't think so we really deal no damage to every boss we fought oh my god of course it's not going to go anywhere else there's nowhere else for it to teleport to
[105:28.84]I even dodged too.
[105:38.15]So awkward.
[105:38.79]Alright, it's going to spawn literally right here.
[105:50.56]Again, one more.
[105:54.22]That actually might be a strategy here.
[105:58.60]Just wait for it to teleport and wail on it.
[106:00.44]Yeah.
[106:07.42]It would be so funny if it just fell in the ocean.
[106:14.30]Looks like it was possible.
[106:20.14]There's so many.
[106:20.88]Look at all these fucking random animals.
[106:28.53]I'm behind you.
[106:29.27]Oh my God.
[106:32.13]What?
[106:41.16]Oh, please don't kill me.
[106:45.11]I'm dead.
[106:54.33]This is totally doable if you want to wait an hour.
[106:57.81]I'm willing to wait as long as it takes me to do it.
[107:19.06]Yeah, that's alright.
[107:25.57]Let him cook.
[107:26.19]I'm letting him.
[107:27.17]He has the whole kitchen to himself right now.
[107:29.39]I really don't want to be in this kitchen for this long.
[107:32.98]Like I should be getting paid overtime.
[107:34.50]Yeah, but you'll have the achievement or you know on stream you beat this alone.
[107:50.44]You know what you should do is go stand at the very edge where the world stops and try to get him to jump and land over the edge of the world.
[107:56.16]I should.
[107:59.25]I don't... A lot of the bosses will avoid it.
[108:01.21]I feel like I'm going to walk off by accident.
[108:05.09]Okay, here it is.
[108:09.42]Okay.
[108:11.90]This is menacing.
[108:20.86]uh oh yeah he's not gonna no he's gonna slide me off oh hold on oh please no he's like clipping yeah in the air
[108:50.98]Yeah, halfway.
[108:51.56]I'm going to do a line of Cheetos.
[108:58.29]Please.
[108:59.49]If you would.
[109:00.57]If you could do that for me, please.
[109:03.11]Epic gamer session.
[109:07.82]What was that person even talking about?
[109:10.14]What is this?
[109:10.84]What just happened?
[109:11.32]Oh, yeah, it heals.
[109:13.28]It heals.
[109:13.88]What?
[109:15.20]It kills all of the animals in the area and heals off of them.
[109:32.00]And all of the animals are in a pile, so I think it just hits all of them.
[109:36.42]It does.
[109:38.23]Yeah, every single animal in that actual boss's encounter room are spread out over the course of like a mile.
[109:43.65]Okay, so let's vote to teleport out of here.
[109:50.80]So, alright, we know that's there.
[109:54.62]Can we at least get the item that's up there?
[109:57.66]Up where?
[109:58.06]Where the mog-like enemy is walking the way.
[110:00.98]We would have to go back a bonfire.
[110:03.78]We would.
[110:04.62]Oh, we would.
[110:05.18]Okay.
[110:07.22]So we're going to go to the next one behind the castle, right?
[110:12.84]How do I vote?
[110:14.56]You just pick it.
[110:16.92]Like pick the same one as you?
[110:18.33]Yeah.
[110:25.25]I think we probably both do it like in the same.
[110:27.35]Yeah.
[110:29.88]Go to Caelid.
[110:34.06]I feel like we need to get through Limgrave before we decide to go to Caelid.
[110:46.53]Are you here?
[110:47.63]Yeah.
[110:48.27]Oh, I got loads longer.
[110:51.25]Okay, so we need to... I think it's a chest up there, right?
[110:58.11]uh there's usually a good item up there it's not guaranteed that there will be oh let's try you know what I would want to do if I was calling the shots you you absolutely can call the shot if you want
[111:23.38]know the chest that makes you go to bed and teleport you to the crystal mine I would go there we can do that especially because when you run around the mine you just like smithing stones or something else and you can run around the swamp and pick up a whole bunch of items there what happened to the mog like enemy that was here I don't know what a mog like is is it a new genre of game
[111:50.58]I mean, I feel like if you know, you know, and like, you're not like part of our secret club, so I kind of have to figure it out.
[112:10.89]Alright, you can join the secret club if you do the secret club handshake.
[112:16.21]Don't look up.
[112:16.67]Okay, you ready?
[112:17.93]Put your hand out.
[112:20.69]You shake hands.
[112:22.37]You go like this.
[112:23.22]You go like this.
[112:24.06]You part the hair twice.
[112:25.00]You nod.
[112:26.22]You nod.
[112:26.60]You nod.
[112:27.18]Elbow.
[112:27.58]Elbow.
[112:27.94]Elbow to elbow.
[112:28.66]Elbow to elbow.
[112:29.36]Finger.
[112:30.10]Finger gun.
[112:31.30]Okay?
[112:32.10]And then kiss.
[112:36.12]Okay.
[112:36.70]I hope this item is worth it for you.
[112:38.54]A Mog-like enemy is... It just is... I don't know.
[112:41.75]It's a stupid... There's fire grease.
[112:44.47]It wasn't worth it.
[112:46.28]It's just those big burly guys that kind of look like Mog.
[112:49.04]They're like the blood enemies.
[112:50.64]Big ones.
[112:50.98]It's an omen.
[112:52.64]Yeah.
[112:55.38]A mogman?
[112:56.30]Mogman.
[112:57.08]Omen.
[112:57.66]An omen enemy.
[112:59.18]An omen mogman.
[113:00.02]Yeah, like the blood omen enemies that we called moglikes.
[113:04.73]Because I thought, people, there's a whole thing you're going to have to go read.
[113:08.73]Like, where are we going?
[113:10.45]First step starting bonfire.
[113:16.72]First step.
[113:17.22]Why do you want to go all the way back here?
[113:18.70]You don't want to explore the other stuff on the peninsula?
[113:22.04]I told you where I wanted to go.
[113:26.99]Follow me.
[113:27.85]Okay.
[113:36.24]Delete your way markers.
[113:37.70]I'll keep them because I like to remember where I was.
[113:39.54]All right.
[113:42.02]Follow you.
[113:42.52]Oh, we should see where the dragon is.
[113:45.20]We can do that.
[113:48.82]I wanted to go down into that area.
[113:51.28]That's the teleport chest.
[113:54.00]Okay.
[113:54.94]Lindell Soldier.
[113:57.70]I'm ignoring him so do you want to see who the dragon is it looks like it's a dragon uh it's the way worse dragon isn't that uh surrounded by a whole bunch of like goons in his vr chat lobby as you put it but we're not going we're not doing that I want to go in the hole this dude's spawning with a ballista
[114:25.70]Yeah, it's, uh, it's four to sacks.
[114:28.48]Yeah.
[114:29.24]Okay.
[114:29.62]Straight down this hole.
[114:30.70]There's a lot of shitting enemies here.
[114:32.20]I hope you, uh, I wish you the best.
[114:35.24]I'm down.
[114:36.28]And there's a lot of enemies down here.
[114:37.70]And he's blowing a trumpet.
[114:41.14]Uh, they're going to, oh my God.
[114:48.58]Wait, I need to, how do I say that?
[114:49.64]I need to sit in the mist.
[114:50.85]I can't get in there.
[114:51.45]I can't get in the mist.
[114:54.67]Good luck.
[114:58.20]Oh my god, please, barf drinker, don't kill me!
[115:03.29]Alright, I made it.
[115:03.93]Okay.
[115:14.45]What do we got?
[115:19.72]Okay.
[115:20.86]Is that... Hold on, I may have actually just been... Shit!
[115:26.54]Shit!
[115:31.40]You ready?
[115:32.82]I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be.
[115:42.57]I don't care what enemies generate in this area.
[115:44.87]There's no way it could be worse than what it actually is.
[115:47.65]That's true.
[115:48.57]That's so true.
[115:52.54]It actually made the area way easier.
[116:03.50]Okay, this is the one that has the elevator that goes up and down.
[116:07.96]You can jump off in the middle.
[116:10.68]Okay, we're gonna run around the swamp, grab some stuff.
[116:27.07]Oh, I'm hitting this first try.
[116:29.81]Never mind.
[116:30.17]I thought it went the other way.
[116:32.65]Oh, the invisible thing?
[116:34.07]Yeah.
[116:34.73]This one's annoying.
[116:36.79]Dung beetles?
[116:41.45]Well, you just gotta stand in one spot.
[116:43.92]I'm not doing it.
[116:45.28]I'll do it.
[116:45.58]Okay, I gotta stand in the right spot.
[116:53.94]It's right here.
[116:56.49]Wow.
[116:58.07]This is not a place for us to be standing in one spot.
[117:00.96]You'll be alright.
[117:14.58]And I look forward to being able to... Let's go.
[117:17.18]I want to get this thing.
[117:19.82]It's going to be like a fucking dung.
[117:21.94]It's going to be... Alright, I'm on the horse.
[117:25.98]You wanted to run around here and pick stuff up?
[117:28.00]Yeah.
[117:28.96]Follow me.
[117:29.82]Item.
[117:32.50]Cool.
[117:42.31]Quick, get us out of here.
[117:44.55]Thanks.
[117:47.13]Oh, Millenia wants to talk to me for some reason, but also... What?
[117:51.57]I don't know, does that... Yeah, she wants to talk to me too.
[118:01.35]Hello.
[118:02.31]Forgive me.

[118:10.92]Oh my...
[118:14.55]Okay, I'm dead.
[118:15.61]I couldn't even talk to her.
[118:17.15]She took me to the... No, she didn't.
[118:20.21]I thought she was taking me to the round table.
[118:23.11]I don't know who is doing that.
[118:24.41]Oh, there's a flower thing up there.
[118:27.29]I can't even get to that.
[118:33.02]Okay, let me get the rod off me.
[118:39.58]God damn it.
[118:42.00]Forgive me.

[119:21.58]Okay.
[119:25.13]Oh, it's a giant beetle.
[119:29.07]Do you don't want to kill this?
[119:29.85]This thing's probably got candy in it and shit.
[119:32.07]All right.
[119:32.69]I'm just going to follow you.
[119:33.65]I'm following you.
[119:34.61]You are the quarterback right now.
[119:41.27]You brought the squad.
[119:43.95]You.
[119:44.87]Oh, my God.
[119:45.19]Turn around.
[119:45.61]Turn around.
[119:46.05]Turn around.
[119:46.37]What do you mean turn around?
[119:47.81]Don't go in there.
[119:51.11]I made a wrong turn.
[119:53.07]I'm going to get this fucking thing and we're going to get the item that's inside of it.
[119:59.30]There's a stone sword key.
[120:00.42]What did you get?
[120:01.84]Golden rune three.
[120:03.30]Where did you go?
[120:03.90]I went back down because that's a boss arena with a dragon in it.
[120:11.85]Yeah.
[120:21.26]I'm getting rid of these things.
[120:21.98]Alright, so what is your?
[120:28.51]Why are you here?
[120:29.87]What was your plan here?
[120:30.95]You want to just run around?
[120:31.79]So there's like a the city over here has a whole bunch of items in it.
[120:37.27]We just got invaded.
[120:51.31]Dude, there's one of those ulcerated tree spirits up there.
[120:53.89]We're not getting up there.
[120:56.21]Dude, there's no way.
[120:57.66]This is fucked.
[120:59.90]This is not happening, man.
[121:01.32]This is worse than I thought it would be because of all the fucking gigantic enemies out here.
[121:06.34]It's not like slow swamp enemies anymore.
[121:08.64]It's everything you don't want.
[121:09.90]Oh, okay.
[121:13.40]I got one of the... I will meet you at the round table hold.
[121:19.37]Yeah, I'll see you at the round table.
[121:22.18]I'm going to see if I can grab some shit.
[121:24.40]Somebody said Comic Con.
[121:27.54]Yeah.
[121:28.76]Also, all the people you can buy stuff from at the round table gives a lot of item options.
[121:35.60]Comic Con.
[121:36.25]Alright, are we going to the round table hold or what?
[121:41.73]Yeah, go.
[121:43.57]No, I'm saying this is taking a while.
[121:47.73]And I'm saying, yeah, go.
[121:51.33]Are you there now?
[121:53.69]No, but I can join you.
[121:54.95]I think we have to do the vote teleport, right?
[122:00.25]Um... No, I'm there.
[122:02.31]Okay.
[122:04.17]Yeah, this was not worth it.
[122:06.97]In my mind, it was like... This really is Comic Con.
[122:09.10]Usually, running through here, you can grab a bunch of good stuff, but now it's all like flowers and useless nothing and God to your enemies.
[122:17.74]What?
[122:18.04]Somebody got hurt.
[122:19.30]Who just got hurt?
[122:22.26]I just heard somebody go like...
[122:30.94]Dude, Gideon looks fucking ridiculous.
[122:33.48]It's a different guy.
[122:39.28]Gideon looks like he's playing World of Warcraft with a bunch of, like, level 25 greens.
[122:47.02]That's where I came out of, right?
[123:01.21]Yeah, I think it would be better to run along inside the mine than come out here.
[123:04.77]I'm just going to come to you.
[123:06.83]This is Corrin, yep.
[123:07.71]He still kind of looks thematically accurate, doesn't he?
[123:10.43]Where'd he go?
[123:10.96]Oh, you respawned them.
[123:31.16]I wonder what you sell.
[123:36.74]Aspect of the Crucible Horns.
[123:39.16]Oh, yeah, you can't do it from this very one bonfire.
[123:41.84]Did you say that you were going to do magic?
[123:43.07]Because Fortisax's Lightning Spear is on this guy.
[123:48.57]I mean, that's Faith, right?
[123:51.05]It's Faith, but this is arguably one of the best... Isn't this one of the best Faith weapons in the game?
[123:57.25]This is like one of the best Faith spells in the game, isn't it?
[124:01.87]pretty good I don't want to do that cheesy I just I don't want the situation where one guy's like taking aggro while I'm throwing projectiles I can't wait to see the blacksmith wow what an absolute giga chat and a game full of randomization he doesn't give a he's just wearing the same clothes
[124:49.70]Weird.
[124:50.72]Wait, you're just wearing Corrin's outfit with horns on.
[124:57.86]This game is so good.
[124:59.58]Are you here?
[125:00.12]Not yet.
[125:00.78]I had to go to a different bonfire and I haven't gotten one yet.
[125:04.74]I thought there was one where I am and there is not.
[125:30.50]I can't even describe this.
[125:33.60]It makes me laugh every time I see it, though.
[125:44.25]Oh.
[125:45.35]Got the middle finger fillet.
[125:49.09]Oh, I caught you not doing the pose.
[125:51.74]Oh, shit.
[125:52.40]You missed your acting cue.
[126:08.21]Can I use any of this?
[126:09.01]I don't think so.
[126:20.22]Insane weapon.
[126:21.54]What the fuck?
[126:23.84]Yeah, but I don't have enough dex to put it on.
[126:34.61]Key?
[126:34.77]Key?
[126:40.99]I mean the key this is did you on purpose make the worst build no I just freaked out and put every point in strength because I thought it was like holy well look at this academy key I already got one yeah we're already going I saved money what wait a minute I can't touch this oh okay
[127:16.34]do that every time what put every single point in strength no I didn't I played like a I played like an int dex character warp to the round table hold um I guess I'll agree because I think we both have to I thought you were already there I am but I think I have to like accept it for you to be here too maybe because I'm already here what
[127:41.66]Now it put you standing next to me and I didn't teleport.
[127:44.72]You look at 10 year old at Subway who realizes he can ask for unlimited cheese.
[127:50.81]I probably have to leave.
[127:51.67]Yeah, let's do teleport back to the first bonfire.
[127:56.19]Yep, first step.
[128:11.43]Wait, what, you can get unlimited cheese?
[128:15.24]You know now.
[128:15.74]Okay.
[128:21.22]So now, if you say go to the round table hold, do we both get to go?
[128:25.75]I already did.
[128:27.51]Oh, you did?
[128:27.83]Okay.
[128:27.93]So I think it's queued.
[128:28.95]The round table hold, I think, is fucked up for multiplayer here.
[128:35.48]I wonder if we can both do it.
[128:36.16]I'll vote again.
[128:36.72]Okay, I'm going to do it.
[128:38.58]I already voted.
[128:39.28]Okay.
[128:40.72]You voted to warp to the round table hold.
[128:42.44]I guess it does work.
[128:51.19]There you are.
[128:51.93]Cool.
[128:52.71]I am Melania, Blade of Mykola.
[128:55.95]Did you see Gideon?
[129:00.05]I just got here.
[129:00.95]Oh, I thought you said you were already here.
[129:03.08]No, I haven't been here yet.
[129:05.98]I gave this guy a death route.
[129:10.60]I had found one of those.
[129:12.10]He doesn't have any clothes.
[129:13.50]Okay, that was weird.
[129:14.34]I thought he didn't have any pants on.
[129:15.34]Oh, we got Moog.
[129:16.30]Very well.
[129:30.16]Oh yeah.
[129:30.78]Go rank.
[129:44.47]You look stupid.
[129:46.55]Fuck you.
[129:51.98]I forgot, what's the difference between Arcane and Intellect?
[129:54.08]Like, what does Arcane scale?
[129:55.50]Was that, like, the bleed stuff?
[129:56.88]Arcane is blood.
[129:59.37]Arcane is also, like, its own weird thing with luck and stuff, right?
[130:03.81]Yes.
[130:06.13]Yeah, Arcane is bleed, blood.
[130:10.65]Yeah, Arcane is luck and bleed.
[130:15.17]Oh, there's some dragon spells that scale with Arcane as well.
[130:19.19]You have the Ripple Blade that scales on it.
[130:26.93]Status build up.
[130:34.50]The NPCs all have different outfits for stir.
[130:36.86]Oh, because the items are randomized.
[130:38.34]That's right.
[130:38.98]Yeah.
[130:50.81]Is this what Gideon's face looks like underneath the helmet?
[130:54.34]Or is that randomized too?
[130:56.71]Bloodhound step.
[130:57.89]They're selling me bloodhound step, but I'm poor.
[131:03.02]So Gideon has long white hair.
[131:08.24]Interesting.
[131:17.27]They have faces.
[131:19.41]I've seen the dung eater's face.
[131:30.76]ah hello he must be new here I'm well just call me he's just like kind of like a looks like a peasant or something by the way have you met a young woman or just like a regular take your eyes if you find her oh do you want to jump down here and fight the yeah let's do it yeah let's see what's down here I'm coming not there yet I wonder if it's the same npc
[132:12.58]Okay.
[132:13.86]Oh, okay.
[132:18.26]Is it different?
[132:20.54]I think.
[132:20.82]I think it's different.
[132:23.94]It's frost attacks, right?
[132:26.21]It's usually that frost.
[132:28.19]Oh, my God.
[132:30.07]They got randomized gear.
[132:37.99]Do not let her do that dragon move.
[132:44.91]blood scythe I'm gonna up to blood blood blood blood blood what just happened she just freaked out I respawned
[133:13.05]Oh, you can come back down here then, can't you?
[133:14.39]Even with the reduced health and stuff?
[133:16.47]Yeah, but I'd rather watch.
[133:19.03]Oh, and it's weird.
[133:19.99]I can't even see her.
[133:22.45]Should I not kill her in case it messes up your game?
[133:24.81]Nah, kill her.
[133:25.63]You got this.
[133:26.69]How long does that last?
[133:34.94]Don't you do that!
[133:46.65]What happened?
[133:48.39]That was... She has more than one dragon move, apparently.
[133:55.03]She has all the... Super crazy... Alright, let's go kill this motherfucker.
[134:06.06]Outplayed?
[134:06.56]I'm using a big long... Extra long toothpick right now.
[134:10.16]Okay.
[134:31.11]Watch out for the dragon.
[134:36.60]One shot me.
[134:37.82]I think because I still had the debuff.
[134:39.12]I think we have the debuff, yeah.
[134:48.36]Zerg rush.
[134:50.69]Ah.
[134:51.71]Now you should go talk to the two fingers.
[134:55.20]I hope the two fingers is like a rat or something.
[135:02.61]The grand rat.
[135:06.41]I know you can do the dragon thing again.
[135:17.28]Where are you?
[135:18.82]I went and got the item.
[135:21.48]There's an item?
[135:22.68]Oh, there is.
[135:23.26]There is.
[135:34.14]Ooh, nice.
[135:48.10]I'm gonna die.
[135:52.03]I have like... Dude, what the fuck?
[135:54.05]I have so many debuffs.
[135:56.81]This is stupid.
[135:58.13]It's so fucking wide.
[135:59.96]I'm out.
[136:05.82]I'm out of here.
[136:06.78]Hey, fun fact, dude.
[136:07.62]The weapon you have, that toothpick weapon, is one of the top ten worst items in the game.
[136:12.38]Okay, we're going to do what you wanted to do from the beginning and see how fate would have gone.
[136:16.08]We're going to go up to Morgoth.
[136:20.12]No.
[136:20.28]No.
[136:21.69]You want this fight.
[136:22.75]Rest at the grace.
[136:24.37]Wipe that debuff and get down there and we're going to beat this lady.
[136:28.83]Okay.
[136:31.60]Easy.
[136:32.92]See, I was only dying because I had like four debuffs.
[136:36.24]I don't know how I got them.
[136:40.26]You're supposed to be like the gamer and like you're good at stuff.
[136:42.89]I'm still naked.
[136:45.41]You're like 20 levels, 30 levels higher than me.
[136:56.96]Oh, no!
[136:59.02]It's undodgeable!
[137:05.74]Eat this!
[137:16.39]Why are we not doing this strategy?
[137:18.71]Because he rolls.
[137:22.21]Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[137:25.78]All the NPC fighters in this game, we need to just do that to them.
[137:36.22]And what happened there? ...
[138:03.07]Dude, he almost fucking double killed us.
[138:05.57]You!
[138:14.18]I can't get, I can't get a solid backstab.
[138:17.20]Alright, just keep the distraction up.
[138:21.20]Yeah, just, dude, just do that.
[138:22.84]Just do that.
[138:23.22]Just run away and cast that spell.
[138:24.45]And then he turns on me and I'm so slow.
[138:33.83]How was that not a backstab?
[138:34.47]Yeah, after I hit him, he turned.
[138:35.77]God damn it!
[138:37.07]How many Estus is... Is it two or three?
[138:41.65]I don't know.
[139:00.21]What was that weird shit?
[139:01.23]I would have had the backstab.
[139:13.59]How many of those does this person have?
[139:16.95]That has to be the last one.
[139:20.69]I don't... I think this... I think the other equipment that she has is a... Like 10 Estus Flasks.
[139:36.17]nice don't do it don't do it I'm so scared of the fire okay all right you were gonna also die there you got this dude all right but just you should maybe you should be alive so I'm alive
[140:13.81]They're invisible to me.
[140:15.89]Oh, my God, it's over.
[140:16.85]We're going to lose.
[140:21.75]I can't see them.
[140:25.94]What did you do?
[140:27.16]What did you do?
[140:28.32]I responded.
[140:29.14]What do you mean you respond?
[140:30.54]How did you that came down here?
[140:31.96]They're invisible to me and then they invaded again.
[140:37.31]Oh, my God, dude, are you kidding me?
[140:43.75]Because you waited.
[140:47.11]You hesitated.
[140:50.99]I wanted you to get the item if you die.
[140:56.12]Just rest.
[140:57.40]I can't.
[140:58.74]I'm just going to die then.
[141:00.90]We're not messing this up again.
[141:08.21]Okay, we're good.
[141:12.10]You gotta read chat between attempts, big guy.
[141:15.08]You sounded like a train whistle.
[141:19.26]Alright, what do we need?
[141:22.86]Upgrade the toothpick.
[141:24.58]I don't want to upgrade the toothpick because I don't know if we're going to get enough smithing stones to even complete anything.
[141:28.70]What's going on down there?
[141:29.66]I don't know.
[141:39.70]What the fuck just happened?
[141:43.00]She was waiting for us, man.
[141:44.60]She was waiting for us.
[141:47.64]I don't see her.
[141:49.66]I resummoned her.
[141:51.08]This whole thing might be fucked now.
[141:52.70]Do we have two?
[141:54.44]You landed on the ground.
[141:55.42]I didn't even see the fire that killed you.
[141:58.77]Are there two of them down there?
[142:01.51]No, but I think it's desynced.
[142:05.59]Can we leave?
[142:06.75]At least like if you want to fight this, we can leave and come back because something is fucked up.
[142:10.94]All right.
[142:12.14]Hold on.
[142:15.36]I'm going to die.
[142:15.90]Die.
[142:17.48]Okay.
[142:18.16]I'm dead.
[142:18.60]All right.
[142:20.39]Too bad.
[142:20.85]On my screen, you jumped off, landed on the ground.
[142:23.21]There was nothing there.
[142:24.19]And then you just died on fire.
[142:29.89]Just traveled to and from the round table.
[142:33.86]Okay, let's just... Alright, you know what?
[142:35.38]Let's just leave.
[142:36.20]We're going to leave.
[142:37.60]I want to fight Margit.
[142:39.00]Okay.
[142:40.60]Let's go.
[142:41.82]Gate front.
[142:42.54]And we'll just run up to Margit.
[142:43.54]Gate front.
[142:45.42]And... Yo.
[142:48.87]Right?
[142:49.65]Everything's fine.
[142:50.41]Yo, we never even did that lizard in the cave.
[142:55.41]We have made no progress.
[142:59.73]I leveled up 30 times.
[143:02.68]I have not.
[143:08.09]Alright.
[143:09.29]Things are good.
[143:10.75]Everything's good.
[143:11.23]Make sure you don't have that debuff still.
[143:14.87]Yo, actually, hold on.
[143:16.21]Rest at the grace, because I have two of them.
[143:17.79]Hold, hold, hold.
[143:19.58]I'm about to crack the... I'm cracking the case.
[143:22.22]What do you mean?
[143:24.08]I actually can upgrade to plus five on a weapon.
[143:27.32]I have the whole chain.
[143:30.70]She's asking me about torrent again?
[143:32.32]Now she wants me to go... I was already at round table.
[143:37.06]You broke it.
[143:46.89]Why does he still have this?
[143:48.29]Alright, so we debated if we were going to trade weapons.
[143:51.87]And we came to the agreement that... My game crashed.
[143:55.25]Oh.
[143:58.34]I would imagine that something weird has been going on because once we went down... Yeah, alright.
[144:02.82]Let's just reset it.
[144:04.22]You restart.
[144:05.96]I crashed, so I need to relaunch.
[144:08.20]Alright, let's just reset it.
[144:12.34]reset it just trade weapons yeah but so it's like should we not I think it might be more interesting if we don't we don't trade I just that was very weird I went all the way back here oh you know what I think I got teleported out of the game I'm just gonna restart the game it's probably for the best right okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna go to round table I have like a long sword I can upgrade to five
[144:39.60]It's up to you.
[144:40.10]Yeah, I think it's more fun this way.
[144:42.02]Look, if it gets to a point where we can't make any progress, then whatever.
[144:45.14]I don't think that'll happen.
[144:46.95]Did you... Did you exit the whole game, or did you just restart, like, the... My game crashed.
[144:53.59]Oh, okay.
[144:54.73]I think I don't know.
[144:55.39]I think I finally got the Millennia Go to Roundtable hold, and it was, like, super confused because I had already been there.
[145:00.20]All right, so should I try to join you?
[145:04.76]uh go to a bonfire and see if uh you can talk to millennia before you rejoin me I'll actually I'm gonna go to round table I cannot and then invite you because my game still feels like it's being a little weird I feel like I'm okay I go to gate front let me see
[145:29.38]and then later I could um I could just upgrade this weapon to uh give it a in ashes of war when I find it if I upgrade a long sword I no longer have millennia here so okay give me one minute sir I didn't quit out of the whole game I just kind of reset this okay sir kind of thing so I think we're okay I don't have any
[146:01.06]I don't have any runes to do it.
[146:03.40]It's still heavy.
[146:08.02]I got a different talisman though.
[146:11.92]Now I'll definitely keep that on.
[146:15.84]We also, I think it's always in the same spot.
[146:17.80]We have to go get the like crystal elixir thing that you get for free at some point at the church.
[146:25.56]Did you buy that sacred tear that was on that vendor?
[146:30.79]I don't think I ever saw one.
[146:32.25]That was you.
[146:32.87]Ours are different.
[146:33.47]Oh, that's right.
[146:34.17]It is different.
[146:34.89]I'm just going to go grab whatever this.
[146:41.95]Are you ready for me to join your game?
[146:45.37]No, I'm upgrading my weapon.
[146:46.57]You have a plus five long sword.
[146:50.47]I'm back.
[146:51.25]Sniff, sniff.
[146:52.15]You died so many times.
[147:07.30]I could put Glintstone Pebble on it.
[147:08.94]I'm not doing it.
[147:13.01]Bloodhound Step, Longsword.
[147:22.39]Yeah, I got a little excited.
[147:23.55]I got like 20,000 runes.
[147:27.36]I came into the... I'm gonna go to the gatehouse and set up the thing to invite you.
[147:31.46]Okay, I'm right there.
[147:32.62]Gatefront.
[147:34.10]I brought like five dolls to the casino and hit like a $50,000 jackpot and then put $50,000 on red and lost it all.
[147:42.31]Like, I just freaked out and was just like, let's go!
[147:44.17]And I put everything into one spot and I just fucked everything up.
[147:51.49]My world is open to wanderers.
[147:54.09]There's level two decks.
[147:56.33]I'm just going to put two points in Dex.
[147:57.99]I know everyone's going to be like, it's going to be fine.
[148:01.69]Don't worry.
[148:06.37]I'm using it.
[148:21.58]Does your character have a thong on?
[148:23.28]I don't think so.
[148:24.92]Okay.
[148:25.89]Seems to be back to normal.
[148:28.59]Nice.
[148:28.83]Let's do it.
[148:33.11]How's the game audio, everybody?
[148:34.19]Is it... The audio's good?
[148:35.51]Are we in a good spot?
[148:38.91]I don't know what that is, but... Sounds good.
[148:47.78]What's happening?
[148:50.30]Why are you... Why are you just sitting here?
[148:52.62]What?
[148:54.17]I'm... I took my horse up all the way up the road.
[148:56.65]Oh, you... Okay, you were just frozen for me for a sec.
[149:04.62]I figure we just do stuff up in this direction.
[149:06.60]There's a couple of the... There's like a jail we can try.
[149:10.54]Those aren't dogs.
[149:11.86]I love that that golden seed was actually a golden seed.
[149:13.96]Is that not random?
[149:16.64]Um... It should be.
[149:18.27]It might not be, but it should be.
[149:20.07]Pretty lucky if that's the case.
[149:26.88]not random yeah I like actually deal damage now I'm ready for the real market I need two all right so do you want to go beat the you want to do the worm oh we can do that if you feel like that you're confident that we could do yeah I I feel confident I can kill it I mean I can kill it did you say that we can kill it that we can kill it that we as a team
[149:54.46]OK, just.
[149:55.86]It'll feel like you kind of.
[149:59.84]It's like.
[150:09.14]Don't we have to send send her back to the round table?
[150:14.03]Yeah, if you're kind of like a simp like that.
[150:22.19]She gave me a twig.
[150:27.75]Grove side cave.
[150:28.91]That is where is that one?
[150:32.06]Where's the Grove side cave?
[150:33.36]That's the one with the beast in it above the starting area.
[150:39.85]There it is.
[150:47.18]Please do a Grover voice.
[150:49.04]Grover, that's me, Grover!
[150:51.32]I fucking hate that.
[150:52.44]I'm so pissed off.
[150:53.20]That was so cringy and aw- I'm so annoyed with myself that I just listened to you.
[150:57.64]I don't even know who Grover is.
[151:00.92]Why did it- it's just like my body just decides to do that.
[151:03.33]It's like, hey, do an impression of Peter Griffin.
[151:05.65]Yeah, it should be Peter Griffin!
[151:06.59]It's like, shut up!
[151:08.25]Shut up!
[151:08.71]Jump, jump, monkey.
[151:12.50]Dude, I swear to God I saw your ass poking out the back of your flaps.
[151:15.81]All right, let's play this.
[151:18.59]Don't let the intrusive thoughts in.
[151:20.51]All right.
[151:22.59]Ready, gamers?
[151:29.34]Is this do or die?
[151:50.10]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[152:11.97]Oh, that's cheap.
[152:12.91]That's unfortunate.
[152:16.87]He zoned us.
[152:20.09]Oh, my God.
[152:20.84]I can't even see anything.
[152:23.40]You're okay.
[152:24.70]Kind of.
[152:25.10]It's happening again.
[152:30.54]That was not fair.
[152:31.88]Can you do any other move?
[152:34.50]No, don't do that.
[152:40.85]I rolled.
[152:41.41]I was mid roll.
[152:42.15]This guy is cheating so hard.
[152:49.05]We're doing fine.
[153:16.67]Ooh, big deal.
[153:19.13]Big deal.
[153:20.56]Oh, come on.
[153:21.24]Come on.
[153:23.12]Why can't we get it?
[153:24.80]It's better that you didn't because he would have had iframes for me.
[153:29.55]He just woke up and started fucking throwing up in the corner.
[153:32.83]You got this.
[153:33.33]I'll bear it.
[154:09.27]You got this.
[154:10.37]Why would you do that?
[154:11.77]I'm concentrating.
[154:13.19]Don't just scream.
[154:15.17]You got it.
[154:19.66]You're trying to make us lose.
[154:21.68]No mistakes now.
[154:22.94]Look what you've done.
[154:23.44]Look what you've done.
[154:24.02]And now I'm distracted.
[154:24.74]And now we're talking.
[154:32.92]Watch out.
[154:33.28]Watch out.
[154:41.63]We lose here.
[154:42.09]It's your fault.
[154:42.57]I'm just saying.
[154:44.03]I'm doing a scream stream.
[154:45.57]He's going to pound it.
[155:03.19]Don't get hit.
[155:05.31]Shut your mouth, please.
[155:14.56]Alright, scream.
[155:15.54]Alright, let's do it.
[155:16.48]Yes, finally.
[155:17.12]Finally, a weapon.
[155:28.44]You want the wheel, dude?
[155:29.88]I don't think I need the wheel considering that the gargoyles... It's a faith weapon.
[155:44.31]Oh yeah, it's a pretty good sword.
[155:46.72]Or axe.
[155:47.58]Weapon.
[155:49.40]It is if I had, uh... 22 faith.
[155:55.12]Uh, you need to bonfire.
[155:56.64]I won't respawn.
[155:59.40]I need to bonfire?
[156:01.67]Yeah, like, I'm not respawning.
[156:03.53]Oh, I'm just going to go back to the entrance.
[156:04.91]Is there anything else in here?
[156:08.11]Uh, no.
[156:12.25]What did you get?
[156:12.69]Uh, Giza's wheel.
[156:17.60]The pizza cutter two-hander.
[156:19.74]Oh.
[156:22.20]My game is really freaking out that you teleport it.
[156:25.96]I rested at the graces that help you.
[156:29.35]Uh, because he died.
[156:31.51]Yeah, now I'm responding.
[156:36.23]There you are.
[156:37.89]Alright, so.
[156:38.57]Here so I discard.
[156:48.32]Use the wheel?
[156:49.40]All right.
[156:50.14]I'm taking... All right.
[156:50.82]We're allowed three trades.
[156:52.18]I'm taking one of those trades.
[156:53.42]I want the wheel.
[156:55.12]That's a nice rule.
[156:57.10]There you go.
[156:58.50]Yeah.
[157:21.07]It's pretty sick.
[157:25.22]I think I'm really feeling the spear right now.
[157:30.28]I'm feeling the spear for another at least 20 minutes before I put it on.
[157:33.92]Alright, how much dex do I actually need?
[157:54.57]Alright, the next... Okay, wish for, like, a bunch of good runes.
[157:58.34]Alright, where are we teleporting to, though?
[158:00.54]Because we... We're going up to Morg.
[158:03.74]Yeah, let's go fight Morgut.
[158:16.57]Yeah, I'm going to be your squire the whole game the way I'm dressed.
[158:19.57]Did you do the shack?
[158:21.79]Yeah, my game.
[158:23.09]I can't get off the map.
[158:23.95]I'm like frozen.
[158:28.16]Did that help?
[158:29.62]No, I'm stuck on the map.
[158:32.10]And I can hear you walking around.
[158:33.54]Yeah, I just sat at the bonfire.
[158:37.24]It said warp to Stormhill Shack failed.
[158:39.73]Oh, I did it again.
[158:42.27]I voted again.
[158:43.03]Here we go.
[158:44.87]Okay, good.
[158:47.25]seamless the axe is just the weapon art for faith can I actually use it um I have a weapon art I can give you as well if you want if you can I don't even think you can change it on that weapon I have like earthbreaker after war I wonder if this works
[159:15.70]It wouldn't have the axe on it, though, would it?
[159:17.28]No, it wouldn't.
[159:25.39]Yeah.
[159:26.90]The axe?
[159:27.28]I don't think this is going to work.
[159:28.40]Let's try it.
[159:33.20]Oh.
[159:33.64]Oh.
[159:38.63]Oh, actually, no, we're good.
[159:41.37]We're good.
[159:41.67]We're good.
[159:41.97]This actually works.
[159:43.88]This is doing, this is okay.
[159:46.74]Doing more than before.
[159:47.92]My little glintstone pebble on this longsword does the same amount of damage from before if I hit something like 10 times.
[159:58.34]All right.
[159:59.18]Mount up.
[160:01.02]Yeah, I was doing 71 damage before.
[160:02.74]Now I'm doing 91.
[160:03.20]It has to be something, right?
[160:04.86]Oh, I'm doing like 250.
[160:08.01]You got to get like the tier one somber stone.
[160:12.43]Somebody said, no, dude, that spear is really just that bad.
[160:15.84]What the hell is behind us?
[160:17.20]Okay, we're good.
[160:35.20]This is our comeback arc.
[160:37.64]I think so.
[160:39.39]I think we finally got like the critical mass of items.
[160:43.51]The critical mass.
[160:45.59]Oh, do not aggro that fucking thing.
[160:48.05]Where'd you go?
[160:48.43]Oh, shit.
[160:48.85]It's the Scion thing.
[160:51.27]Oh, it's coming after me.
[160:52.55]I'm just going to go up into the tunnel.
[160:54.70]We're just running by?
[160:55.58]Yeah.
[160:56.54]Okay, kill this guy in one hit.
[161:08.11]Can you do a Marge Simpson for me?
[161:18.77]Homer, it's me, Marge.
[161:23.84]I don't think that we can afford that, Bart.
[161:27.02]Sorry.
[161:28.54]Thank you.
[161:30.54]He just does it.
[161:31.30]He just fucking does it.
[161:34.56]Okay, let's go fight Marge.
[161:39.86]Is the cutscene going to be different?
[161:41.92]I hope so.
[161:42.84]I hope it's like a bug.
[161:49.07]If it's the same, I'm skipping.
[161:52.43]But if a rat, it's him.
[161:54.21]Is it?
[161:54.77]Skip.
[161:55.65]Skip.
[161:58.37]We just fought you.
[161:59.85]What?
[162:00.03]I don't want to fight you again.
[162:02.80]It's the same boss!
[162:10.20]Oh my god, hold on.
[162:12.00]I'm dead.
[162:15.57]I'm fat rolling right now because of the stupid axe.
[162:21.93]What?
[162:23.05]What happened to you?
[162:24.57]I jumped over the lava, but it's just doing the walk back and forth, mocking us.
[162:30.17]Makar the Fel Omen.
[162:32.03]Why does it have that title?
[162:36.03]It has the Fel Omen title.
[162:41.41]Oh, good luck.
[162:42.11]It can take you all day.
[162:43.29]It still says the line.
[162:50.45]Oh, man.
[162:58.03]Back to Limgrave.
[163:06.15]This is the two phase version.
[163:07.87]The one that stands up.
[163:09.23]Oh, this is going to be awful.
[163:14.03]We got this.
[163:14.53]Just just fix your fat rolling.
[163:15.95]Get naked with me.
[163:18.51]Me strong.
[163:19.40]Remember me strong.
[163:23.04]OK, let's go.
[163:23.58]That last one was a test.
[163:26.80]How tarnished?
[163:29.90]Looks like you may be in search of the Elden Ring.
[163:56.15]Oh yeah, you can't do that.
[163:59.97]This is going to absolutely screw us.
[164:07.15]God damn it.
[164:08.00]That's why I didn't want to be back.
[164:09.20]That's why I didn't want to be over there.
[164:34.30]Whoa Please don't kill me
[164:48.70]forget if this is like sakiro and you can jump when he does that attack don't don't get the parry don't get the parry oh no no no no don't go off
[165:18.53]Uh oh, he's standing up.
[165:34.40]I don't remember this move set very well.
[165:35.94]And I'm out of healing potions.
[165:38.84]It's a lot of really long windups.
[165:43.04]What the fuck is happening?
[165:46.16]Good question.
[165:55.33]Oh, shit.
[165:59.07]Oh, the iframes, you're right.
[166:00.35]Careful.
[166:07.06]Sorry, I thought we scared you.
[166:09.94]Daira's running away.
[166:20.13]What the heck?
[166:25.85]Dodge this.
[166:27.35]We gotta get under him again.
[166:28.47]I shouldn't have run away.
[166:29.28]Big swing.
[166:52.11]He wants me.
[166:54.05]But you can have me!
[166:56.21]He's coming for me now.
[167:00.32]Watch out for the Ninja Turtles, mate!
[167:02.00]I'm trying to get the stun.
[167:11.46]Oh my god!
[167:15.81]There it is!
[167:17.47]Kick his ass!
[167:17.95]Kick his ass!
[167:23.46]I got the iframes tab at the end.
[167:27.35]OK, alright, alright, back it up.
[167:32.61]Don't be crazy.
[167:47.22]He killed his bull!
[167:49.65]He killed his bull!
[167:50.23]How?
[167:50.55]How?
[167:50.81]You were behind him!
[167:52.85]I waited so long for the roll to, I felt like I timed it perfectly.
[167:56.41]What?
[167:57.73]That's fucked up.
[167:59.47]What?
[168:00.22]No.
[168:00.90]That's fucked up in two ways.
[168:03.56]How did he hit his bull?
[168:04.52]I was behind, I was back where his tail was.
[168:14.36]That's called cheating.
[168:16.48]Oh, that sucks.
[168:17.46]It's all right.
[168:18.00]How come you didn't grab your runes?
[168:23.22]I was focused.
[168:28.22]Shit.
[168:28.50]All right.
[168:28.72]We got it.
[168:29.04]We got it.
[168:29.30]We got it.
[168:29.58]We got it.
[168:29.92]We got it.
[168:30.22]We got it.
[168:33.12]I could feel that coming the whole that whole wind up.
[168:35.86]I was like, I can't believe we're about to lose like this.
[168:39.62]Wait, I lost the runes.
[168:40.80]Wait, what?
[168:42.10]Oh, whoops.
[168:42.68]It's alright.
[168:43.16]I'll get him back.
[168:43.88]I don't even know what hit me.
[169:08.05]Well on him.
[169:16.36]Need stamina.
[169:18.77]Careful.
[169:19.73]I thought you went off the edge for a second.
[169:35.54]How did that miss?
[169:45.73]I can't go over there oh my goodness dude no I died I I heard the dialogue start and I thought he was gonna phase transition but then he did one more attack
[170:19.36]I feel like I should just jump off the edge.
[170:24.56]I don't think I'm doing this with two health potions.
[171:04.92]Uh-oh.
[171:09.45]Uh-oh.
[171:10.19]There's no way I was going to do that other one.
[171:17.83]He hates hitting the boss.
[171:21.36]This is the one.
[171:22.36]I cannot believe we did not.
[171:24.02]I got to get over that.
[171:24.86]Okay.
[171:26.06]If you need a second...
[171:32.46]Rethink your life choices.
[171:33.48]I'm good.
[171:40.58]Okay.
[171:43.36]Ready?
[171:45.00]Yep.
[171:47.51]Yeah, if you need a flower or a rock, I've got it, by the way.
[171:53.81]That was a really weird path that he took.
[171:56.23]That was so... That was... Okay.
[171:59.73]And we're stuck in the... We're stuck in between that shit.
[172:02.81]Don't let it get to you.
[172:07.31]We go again.
[172:07.93]I...
[172:24.76]dude I came in coming in here so confident and it's just weird I'm dead no you're not you're fine that doesn't that ah that right of passing skill why your blood must truly be in diving
[172:56.65]Somebody said, have him drop the anchor for you.
[173:01.17]But that's two out of three items to trade.
[173:15.51]Just do it, laughing my ass off.
[173:17.93]All right.
[173:20.73]Focus, confidence, patience.
[173:28.71]Pulling it back.
[173:36.27]Chaos is a ladder.
[173:41.06]Bro, what are you doing?
[173:41.90]I don't fucking know.
[173:43.40]I'm sorry.
[173:45.48]Just give me the thing.
[173:46.24]Give me the fucking weapon.
[173:47.68]Do you want me to jump off?
[173:50.02]I don't know.
[173:50.66]I got locked in.
[173:51.78]I got locked in and I just...
[174:00.62]the anchor I don't have the anchor what do you mean I deleted the anchor remember no when I first tried to drop you the anchor I discarded it instead of dropped it oh
[174:25.06]That's right.
[174:26.30]Otherwise, I have a Knight Rider Halberd.
[174:28.02]I don't think that's it.
[174:30.56]Can I use that thing?
[174:34.95]It's strength and dex.
[174:36.53]How much dex?
[174:42.73]Oh, no.
[174:43.12]Zero attributes required.
[174:44.76]Put it on the ground.
[174:51.04]Shit, how do I do this again?
[175:03.08]Try the pizza cutter.
[175:03.86]I need more decks for that.
[175:06.67]There you go.
[175:07.25]I'm pretty sure that's a good weapon, too.
[175:08.63]Oh, my God.
[175:09.33]Thank goodness.
[175:09.87]Let me see.
[175:11.17]That's your number two out of three.

[175:15.61]All right.
[175:16.31]No, this is perfect.
[175:17.19]Yes.
[175:17.73]All right.
[175:17.99]We're good.
[175:23.84]Two out of three trades.

[175:45.23]Pulling it back.
[175:45.77]Pulling it back.
[175:47.87]He hit you with the backswing.

[179:40.35]It's supposed to be me doing that.
[179:54.38]You haven't been hit in 30 straight seconds.
[180:08.44]Stir is better than you and Stir combined.
[180:13.33]Don't laugh at that.
[180:14.25]Don't laugh at that.
[180:15.13]That's not funny.
[180:16.43]That is very funny.
[180:18.77]That's not funny.
[180:20.47]It is though.

[186:12.32]Yeah, I don't want to be in this corner.
[186:14.27]Yeah, that's bad.
[186:23.47]You're in that corner.
[186:24.65]You're in that corner.
[186:25.99]It'll be fine.
[186:29.08]I don't like you being over there.
[186:30.44]It's too close to the...
[186:41.19]Stir.
[186:42.21]I don't like this.
[186:43.03]I'm farming him, dude.
[186:53.78]I'm backing up.
[186:57.98]Now you're in the corner.
[186:59.22]Now it's on me.
[187:04.41]Oh, yep.
[187:11.89]Where am I?
[187:13.76]Oh, you got good.
[187:19.46]Backing up, I don't.
[187:23.66]Watch out fire behind you.
[187:28.09]Thank you for the heads up.
[187:32.17]He's going to pull it back.
[187:36.05]And it has a hitbox the size of the Earth.
[187:44.19]I'll stand up in a second.
[187:51.55]Oh, yeah.
[187:54.03]He's been in this corner this entire time.
[187:59.74]Oh, fucking Ninja Turtle!
[188:12.78]Big swing.
[188:14.98]Gotten used to that timing after dying twice.
[188:25.79]No, he got you.
[188:30.89]He fucking stepped on me, dude.
[188:35.81]He can't do it, dude.
[188:38.46]it's like if we miss time that one time we die I think when we see him go for it we need to just run away like not even roll just like walk away I'm gonna upgrade my weapon do you have the upgrades for it I think I have I should hey remember uh you only need to use one stone per upgrade oh
[189:07.89]Alright, I'm going to go upgrade this a couple times.
[189:09.54]Okay.
[189:13.44]Wait, what?
[189:14.14]Oh, that's right.
[189:14.87]You cheated.
[189:15.75]I forgot.
[189:17.37]I cheated?
[189:17.83]Yeah, didn't you?
[189:18.85]She said like, shouldn't it be like 1, 2, then 5, then 10, then 10 or something?
[189:23.03]It goes like 1, 3, 6.
[189:24.35]1, 3, 6.
[189:25.51]1, 3, 6.
[189:26.43]I'm pretty sure.
[189:27.53]Or like 1, 2, 3, 4.
[189:28.81]Like, yeah.
[189:29.57]But I've played randomizer before.
[189:32.23]And like I said, it took me like eight hours of walking around looking for smithing stone threes.
[189:36.11]And it wasn't fun.
[189:38.19]It was just like extremely tedious.
[189:42.34]uh did you go back to the hole no did you you're still standing here I tried to warp to it I voted to warp there even just one or two times my game crashed no yeah something about round table hold is not great maybe we need to go to that other blacksmith and get that waypoint yeah who's uh not
[190:12.15]Yeah.
[190:18.71]Oh yeah, in the first church you can blacksmith there.
[190:20.83]We should do that.
[190:23.27]Can you do everything there?
[190:26.11]Like can you?
[190:26.96]You can just do everything.
[190:27.70]Doesn't matter.
[190:28.56]Yeah, we'll start doing that then.
[190:29.92]I think that one has a limit and then you need to find the giant blacksmith if you wanted to do everything without going to hold.
[190:37.48]How much is it to upgrade this shit?
[190:47.59]The church has a limit of only up to plus three.
[190:56.44]Can I sell?
[190:57.14]What can I sell to?
[190:59.22]Maybe not.
[191:02.62]Also, if you want to go to that first mine, I don't think it will be smithing stuff, but there's still a ton of items to pick up in those mines.
[191:11.81]The blacksmith can sell?
[191:12.71]Oh, I thought it was not the blacksmith, but the blacksmith didn't let you do it.
[191:20.82]I swear I'll get it right.
[191:23.18]It's been a while since I've played Elden Ring.
[191:39.91]690?
[191:40.17]That's a weird number.
[191:41.39]Yeah, that's my graphics card.
[191:47.41]What's going on right now?
[191:54.06]Alright, so, boom.
[191:56.57]I'm going to upgrade this once because I don't think I can afford anything else.
[192:02.09]Don't I have any just random stupid items I can just get rid of?
[192:04.96]I don't like this.
[192:31.53]828.
[192:31.59]What?
[192:31.85]I can't warp?
[192:38.19]All right.
[192:39.05]This thing is pretty good now.
[192:40.97]Okay.
[192:41.35]I believe in us.
[192:42.03]I'm going to put my thing down.
[192:43.17]Push your thing down.
[192:46.15]You sold the Rivers of Blood?
[192:48.86]Yeah.
[192:51.02]Your problem?
[192:52.95]That's what I should.
[192:53.55]I'm pretty sure also you can sell the grave wards for quite a bit, which I should do.
[192:58.77]Just level.
[193:08.40]This is my first stream.
[193:09.40]What emotes should I use?
[193:10.50]Oh, you probably should use.
[193:16.67]I am ready to join you.
[193:18.97]My join me.
[193:20.31]Do it.
[193:20.55]It's all on you.
[193:31.30]I will say for how crazy and broken and buggy this could really be, this works pretty smoothly.
[193:40.05]This is actually remarkable that we've only had a couple of small bug-like crashes in three hours playing this.
[193:48.14]All right, this is the one.
[193:59.86]That's so much damage.
[194:04.42]Come on, bro.
[194:05.46]I'm dead.
[194:06.30]I slid all the way off.
[194:07.16]I just want to see how much damage I do.
[194:12.79]100.
[194:12.81]That's better.
[194:17.15]What was it?
[194:18.75]It was like 90 or like 70.
[194:19.86]Hey, don't worry.
[194:23.16]I got this.
[194:24.76]Watch this.
[194:27.46]Oh, dude, Jerma is so much better than Jerma and Ster.
[194:30.26]Like, check this out.
[194:41.57]I mean, I will have to bow to you for all eternity.
[194:45.13]Really?
[194:45.42]If you beat him right now.
[194:46.16]Are you serious?
[194:47.60]Yeah.
[194:49.86]I even have a fun story if you want it after this.
[194:51.98]Okay.
[194:52.56]Related to that.
[195:14.32]honestly also I feel like we would have done this if either of us had like plus one estus sorry bro your game crashed mine just did
[195:33.81]Mine did not.
[195:35.55]I crashed.
[195:36.63]The AI took over.
[195:38.43]I mean, you did say that this wasn't as buggy as it could be a second ago.
[195:41.75]So you were asking for it.
[195:43.85]Yeah, but kind of like, you know what happens in Left 4 Dead when somebody drops out of the game, like the AI took over.
[195:47.80]That's what you were just watching.
[195:53.48]We doing this or what?
[195:54.22]We did it first try.
[195:55.36]Oh, I thought you actually... Okay.
[195:57.48]Yeah, we're doing it.
[195:58.36]We're doing it.
[195:58.88]We did it first try.
[196:00.38]How?
[196:00.82]What the...
[196:02.79]Heck what the why is this health gone?
[196:08.49]Dude I'm fucking rolling by it
[196:22.44]This salamander crawl, I'll say it.
[196:25.32]Worst monster move in all Dark Souls games.
[196:28.12]No, it is not.
[196:29.73]Not even close.
[196:32.49]What's worse than this?
[196:33.81]The bed of chaos.
[196:35.89]The bed of chaos swipe move is worse than this by far.
[196:38.25]I don't remember that.
[196:41.09]No way.
[196:41.59]This is not even close.
[196:49.86]Dude.
[196:50.98]Dude.
[196:52.96]I haven't gotten to participate yet.
[196:57.94]And I'm out of flasks.
[197:05.58]Fuck!
[197:12.14]You're out of flasks right now?
[197:14.34]Yeah, I take so much fucking damage.
[197:27.61]I I can sense you're tilted right now and it's like up my game well this whole fight I believed and then you come in and then he walks he walks away from you then he walks away from you and then he walks away from you and then he does all of your health and damage from walking away from you
[197:48.69]Okay.
[197:50.91]We should... One more try and then we'll go explore.
[197:54.15]Jerma has six flasks?
[197:56.60]Yeah.
[197:56.94]Do you?
[197:57.28]Yeah.
[197:58.70]Are you for real?
[198:00.38]Where are you allocating?
[198:01.88]I have three flasks.
[198:03.52]How many mana flasks do you have?
[198:05.48]I had one because I was actually using glintstone pebble.
[198:09.91]Why did... Were you using glintstone pebble right now?
[198:14.19]I was.
[198:14.69]I'm going to take it off.
[198:16.76]I mean, I'm seeing a lot of omega lows, but we're dying in one hit.
[198:20.24]Doesn't matter.
[198:22.40]Hey, I have six flasks.
[198:24.70]That's true.
[198:25.80]But we're dying in one hit from that move.
[198:28.78]Skill issue.
[198:32.60]Silence!
[198:36.30]About to go full gamer mode, dog, yo.
[198:39.58]Oh, want to walk away real quick?
[198:42.55]That's the worst fucking move in any Dark Souls.
[198:45.15]I'm telling you.
[198:46.19]I'm telling you.
[198:46.79]No, it is not.
[198:48.20]The worst move in all of Dark Souls.
[198:50.02]You know what?
[198:51.38]Let's just focus.
[198:52.78]Okay.
[198:53.06]You know what?
[198:56.48]Just dodge it, dude.
[198:59.10]Just dodge it.
[198:59.78]Why are you not dodging it?
[199:01.08]You're in my...
[199:03.45]We're fighting this boss in an area where he's not supposed to be right now.
[199:07.25]That's the issue!
[199:23.52]All right.
[199:24.06]Relax.
[199:24.42]We're good.
[199:24.74]We're good.
[199:25.00]We're going to get in there.
[199:27.10]We beat him the first try.
[199:29.15]By the way, I was using a weapon that was only doing like 60 damage a swing when we beat him last time.
[199:35.53]Okay, let's do it again.
[199:36.35]We finally got six upgraded flasks.
[199:39.05]That's not the problem.
[199:40.23]That's not the problem.
[199:41.65]That's not the problem.
[199:43.18]I feel like we would have won if I had fucking six flasks.
[199:45.92]I don't think so.
[199:47.12]You've died in one hit by that move each time.
[199:57.01]See, look, we're good, we're good.
[199:57.81]Just relax.
[200:00.34]No, him walking away from you.
[200:01.82]You good?
[200:02.52]You good?
[200:03.32]We're not good.
[200:05.28]Here he comes again.
[200:15.65]I'm just going to AFK because that's all I got.
[200:19.25]I'm just going to AFK over here.
[200:28.43]Why are you not AFKing?
[200:29.65]You're fine.
[200:30.77]I was while he was running around.
[200:32.05]Alright, this is a good start.
[200:46.96]We're good.
[200:51.06]Oh my God, dude.
[200:55.17]Nice aim.
[200:57.42]Not you, him.
[201:14.18]Alright, easy.
[201:25.49]The greed was kind of strong there.
[201:27.35]The greed was a little strong.
[201:29.03]What do you mean?
[201:32.59]The greed.
[201:33.51]You should have ran away from him.
[201:37.95]When he face transitions, you can hit him for free.
[201:40.81]There was no greed.
[201:41.71]Then he just did that one attack and I mistimed it and then I died.
[201:44.73]Like you did.
[201:46.15]No, but I am...
[201:52.49]When he says the words and he puts, he always puts lava on his sword.
[201:58.13]The fuck?
[201:59.13]I'd watched you respawn in.
[202:00.75]You need to rest at the bonfire.
[202:05.80]You're a coward.
[202:06.76]We're not cowards.
[202:07.46]Why?
[202:13.24]That was a good attempt though.
[202:18.05]This is just how you... Hey, this is randomizer.
[202:20.33]What's the worst boss moves?
[202:22.11]What's your least favorite?
[202:23.31]You were saying some boss.
[202:24.57]I don't really remember it.
[202:26.95]All of Rodan's entire moveset.
[202:29.21]Every single one.
[202:32.11]Every single move Rodan does.
[202:34.57]And that's 1 through 10.
[202:36.01]And then everything else is like 11 to 12.
[202:37.49]13.
[202:37.53]We're just going to pretend that boss doesn't exist.
[202:42.31]Okay.
[202:47.86]I feel like you have to... I'd have to like refresh my memory.
[202:50.72]But I feel like a lot of stuff in Dark Souls 2 was unbelievably annoying.
[202:57.26]It is, but it's usually like the setup of things and not one individual move.
[203:30.78]I'm stuck on a fucking tree.
[203:41.56]He just hit me with the butt of his thingy.
[203:44.96]Very good.
[203:57.38]Where did he go?
[203:59.13]Where is he?
[204:00.65]what he deleted me I thought he was still doing the other side I may need to restart the game yeah I'm out of the fight and respawn me I'm not spectating you okay so now I'm coming back okay I want to go let's go through like the first
[204:29.92]we'll come back we just need like a 10 minute away from here we're gonna go where the dragon is in the beginning go back to the first step we're gonna go into the the the upgrade mine okay so you want to go to the first step the first step okay
[204:58.40]Yeah, so we'll come back.
[204:59.70]We'll be fine.
[205:00.84]There's no sense in getting upset by this.
[205:04.72]I am so happy to be playing games with my good friend.
[205:09.92]Exactly.
[205:10.28]There's no... What's the point of getting upset about this?
[205:14.66]It's a tricky game.
[205:17.29]Game's tricky.
[205:17.89]It's hard.
[205:19.71]So you're asking about why I have so many flasks.
[205:21.09]Did you not pick up the golden seed at the places where you could?
[205:24.31]We walked by two of them.
[205:26.57]They were not golden seeds.
[205:28.23]They weren't?
[205:29.07]I thought people said that... Wait, did... Chat.
[205:32.13]It is... I don't know.
[205:35.63]Maybe your seed... There's a setting so that you can always have those be golden seeds.
[205:42.18]And your seed is... We're going around.
[205:47.18]You don't want to fight this right now?
[205:49.84]I don't want to talk about it.
[205:50.84]I just want to go, you know, diggy, diggy hole.
[206:01.89]or like a shirt of some kind I would like a plus one to my flask so I don't have to use like three flasks every one time I get hit yeah all right
[206:42.44]Do people normally suck this bad at this?
[206:45.36]Yeah.
[206:46.18]Usually worse.
[206:47.02]It's usually... That's why people... You know, that's why people play these games.
[206:52.72]It's because it's usually... Usually it takes a mug of... There's fucking fruits growing out of the wall.
[206:59.23]I was going to say, I picked up a mushroom.
[207:01.45]Oh.
[207:31.50]I miss dark and darker.
[207:32.97]Did you play that?
[207:33.45]I did a little bit.
[207:35.99]Is it good?
[207:36.87]I only played like the first beta and it was actually a lot of fun.
[207:39.91]It looks really cool.
[207:43.78]Definitely wish it had a little bit more to it, but it was great.
[207:48.76]Hopefully when they actually come out in beta, it will be a lot more, right?
[207:53.84]Yeah, I guess it's still like another like year of development or at least.
[208:04.59]OK.
[208:06.13]There's a boss down here too, isn't there?
[208:09.12]Should be, there's always a boss.
[208:12.20]In the mines.
[208:24.62]should do a backflip no I'm good watch out pot friend actually is ow
[208:48.15]Stone sword key.
[208:51.03]Wait a minute.
[208:54.67]I'm waiting.
[208:55.15]That thing actually might be amazing.
[209:05.42]Great omen killer cleaver.
[209:11.10]It's decent.
[209:12.32]I think the axe that you have would be better if you could use it.
[209:17.30]Really?
[209:19.33]believe so uh where did you where are you uh we go back to elevator and there's a this one has the jump off point all right facing forward yeah I'm definitely gonna put at least two three points I gotta I gotta put at least like 14 other way other way what what are you talking about
[209:48.53]What do you mean, other way?
[209:49.77]Oh, I thought you meant... Oh, because you were facing the other direction.
[210:09.40]Okay, so if this is a magma worm in this boss door, I'm going to go buy a lottery ticket today.
[210:18.81]I would do the opposite of buy a lottery ticket because I'm fucking sick of him.
[210:22.27]Ooh.
[210:41.45]Whatever.
[210:41.93]Let him stay there.
[210:43.03]Okay.
[210:56.32]Okay.
[211:02.46]Can we peek in there?
[211:03.34]I hope it's another mad soldier.
[211:08.18]Love that boss.
[211:10.42]Is it a magma worm?
[211:12.02]Oh, God.
[211:13.66]Oh, this is bad.
[211:14.40]We're not gonna be able to beat this.
[211:16.40]No, we don't even have a blunt weapon to hit it with.
[211:21.39]We can do some damage.
[211:23.39]What the fuck?
[211:31.97]What?
[211:32.39]Okay.
[211:33.27]I've been grabbed.
[211:34.47]I am being grabbed.
[211:35.85]I am being grabbed.
[211:40.66]When he grabbed you, my game just froze.
[211:43.64]Oh, weird.
[211:46.94]Holy shit, that's fast.
[211:48.48]I thought it was slower than that.
[211:51.14]Ugh!
[211:55.89]Oh my god, get me away from the fucking door!
[211:59.65]Ugh!
[212:03.78]I actually don't know this boss's moveset at all.
[212:06.02]I never fought it.
[212:07.32]I've tried to fight it once and I was like, I don't like this.
[212:09.36]And then I never did it.
[212:13.78]I mean, you're really kind of supposed to fight this boss with the horse.
[212:28.21]Yeah, he's hard to chase down.
[212:35.97]Oh my god, he just moves around so erratically.
[212:43.47]This is definitely a horse fight.
[212:45.81]This is a horse fight, it really is.
[213:00.62]I don't know what that is.
[213:06.45]call to get on the horse and don't get hit by it.
[213:14.54]Every swing he fucking hops.
[213:16.00]He's...
[213:35.94]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[213:36.98]Just sprint.
[213:37.50]Trying.
[213:38.96]Trying.
[213:41.00]Trying.
[213:42.95]But I got like staggered by every single hit.
[214:14.45]You got this.
[214:16.53]No, I do not.
[214:18.81]He's got this.
[214:24.07]Dude, every one of his moves, it's like, I'm going to the river, and then I'm... Stake of America.
[214:32.60]You're supposed to be on the horse for this fight.
[214:36.39]No, there definitely is one of these that is in a mine, but I don't know if the movesets are the same.
[214:40.67]I can't remember.
[214:41.89]We got it.
[214:42.19]Are we sprinting?
[214:49.70]Or are we fighting?
[214:52.78]Let's go.
[215:03.69]You fight one in the Celia tunnel, really?
[215:06.79]Yeah.
[215:08.73]But I do think it's like a significantly weaker than the main one.
[215:13.03]OK, we're ready.
[215:25.10]We were refreshed on the move set.
[215:27.44]We're good to go.
[215:27.94]OK, I should get a shield at some point.
[215:30.39]There were people selling them in the roundtable, the crash hold.
[215:35.75]Lower health, the horse one has way more magic shit.
[215:38.83]Yeah.
[216:00.88]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[216:02.48]How did I not...
[216:17.11]Dude, everything he does is just like staggered.
[216:53.19]Ooh, that's not good for you.
[216:55.43]I hit the thing by accident.
[216:57.73]I was way off of it.
[216:59.13]Oh, it's all right.
[217:10.83]Dude, can I... What is... What is...
[217:18.88]What the fuck is he doing?
[217:20.34]I just keep hearing you scream.
[217:22.92]I've been perma-comboed for like the last minute.
[217:25.10]Alright, we're good, we're good.
[217:25.74]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[217:37.96]What the fuck just happened?
[217:42.24]Dude, that shit threw me off big time.
[217:55.86]Oh, hey, he runs.
[217:59.26]Like four times, OK?
[218:07.19]You got this man.
[218:24.91]What are you talking about?
[218:31.08]Little fucking Mr. Sixblast over here.
[218:33.84]Stop it.
[218:34.22]This is not the time to make this joke.
[218:55.55]Stop.
[218:57.17]That was a celebration.
[218:58.77]You were going to make me lose.
[219:01.03]Ooh.
[219:04.95]I got a shield.
[219:06.35]I got Melania's armor.
[219:11.88]Cool.
[219:13.30]Woof.
[219:18.60]All right.
[219:18.80]What we got?
[219:20.55]Literally no help at all.
[219:22.53]That does not do anything for either one of us.
[219:24.07]We are still at the same exact place we were before fighting the worm.
[219:28.21]So, cool.
[219:28.76]Well, you got some souls.
[219:31.40]That's true.
[219:32.36]Need you to rest.
[219:33.94]Oh, okay.
[219:36.82]Where is the... Where's the bonfire?
[219:43.73]Is it not just right here?
[219:44.81]It's at the bottom of the elevator.
[219:47.09]Oh.
[219:49.32]Bro, I almost just walked off to get there.
[219:56.50]Bro.
[220:09.23]Let's go to where the elixir is.
[220:13.47]Good idea.
[220:17.93]And then I also gave that guy the grave root.
[220:22.15]So we can go to talk to Beast Boy.
[220:25.40]I think he gives you an item.
[220:26.34]Ooh.
[220:27.98]You know what I mean?
[220:30.02]The teleporter that's in the bush.
[220:33.60]Oh.
[220:34.48]That's right next to where we're going anyway.

[221:21.49]I was going to say, I think it's over here.
[221:26.35]East of the lake.
[221:27.95]East side of Limgrave.
[221:31.59]Artish, can we vote?
[221:33.38]Can we vote?
[221:34.44]I just tried to do it.
[221:37.42]I think they said hit LB, I think.
[221:41.06]That should accept it immediately.
[221:47.17]What?
[221:50.34]Can I not teleport?
[221:51.02]Cause I'm inside the cave.
[221:53.08]Uh, let's just get out of the, yeah.
[221:54.62]Maybe should I get out of the cave?
[221:57.24]I mean, I spawned like at the bottom of it.
[222:00.52]Oh, maybe I gotta get out.
[222:03.00]You have to leave.
[222:11.62]Yeah.
[222:14.82]Yeah.
[222:27.78]you think yourself an Elden Lord you are nothing underneath my boots which boss says that um what just happened
[222:43.07]Are you teleporting?
[222:43.99]Teleporting to the start of the dungeon from the bottom of the dungeon.
[222:47.98]I'm outside right now.
[222:49.54]I'm coming.
[222:50.24]I'm coming.
[222:50.80]I'm coming.
[222:51.20]It's a vote for Artichak.
[222:53.92]I just want to try this dragon.
[222:58.71]The big one over here?
[222:59.91]The scary one?
[223:01.09]Yeah.
[223:01.91]I mean, do you want to just die for a joke?
[223:04.27]Okay, let's go do a joke.
[223:06.85]I believe.
[223:07.53]He should have really low health scaling because he's like...
[223:10.60]a loser right I mean I maybe it sounds like accurate as long as like we don't get aggroed by his whole like crew I mean he's sitting on top of it well he's gone we beat him it was easy he's gonna fly in I just I don't even know where I'm going
[223:41.76]no yeah you got it get off the horse that one shot me nevermind I mean it's definitely doable you could just you could just lay down whatever uh where he's back all right are you uh just respawning or should I just die
[224:11.06]I just respawned.
[224:13.27]Do you want to fight him or do you want to... Something does not look right.
[224:21.32]Let's just get out of here.
[224:46.62]I think it's we go this way.
[224:50.52]He thinks.
[225:01.35]You get the map fragment down here too.
[225:17.59]Okay, you were just flying through the air.
[225:18.64]It looked like you were on a broomstick.
[225:37.33]So you want to go... Okay.
[225:43.42]There's a...
[225:47.30]Yeah, you marked it?
[225:48.62]Oh, no, I see it on the map.
[225:50.46]I'm going to it.
[225:51.94]Okay.
[225:52.58]It's just straight this way.
[225:54.64]Oh, here's Kenneth Hite.
[226:03.14]I want to see what he's wearing.
[226:04.06]A little bit of a little fashionista there, huh?
[226:15.21]Has he got the latest fall trend?
[226:20.24]Yeah, she looks all right.
[226:21.04]He looks all right.
[226:21.90]Smithing Stone 1, Flask of Wondrous Physique.
[226:24.64]Kill him.
[226:25.42]No.
[226:40.74]You want me to kill Kenneth Hite?
[226:43.46]He's... Spoiler alert.
[226:45.92]Spoiler alert.
[226:47.04]Spoilers.
[226:47.82]This is the spoiler of the entire game.
[226:50.14]Kenneth Hite is one of the only NPCs that lives through the whole game.
[226:57.58]I mean, he's pretty fucking sick, don't you think?
[227:00.90]Not in my game.
[227:01.50]Because you probably backstabbed him for fun.
[227:07.77]Well, didn't his quest line not finish when the game came out?
[227:11.05]I think that's why he stayed alive, because they didn't finish his whole arc.
[227:14.26]Oh, well, that's also why I killed him.
[227:17.76]You coming down here?
[227:19.06]Yeah, I didn't want to die.
[227:20.22]There's a bunch of places to fall.
[227:22.06]I want to pee real quick.
[227:24.34]Spoiler is over, yes.
[227:45.48]Okay.
[227:45.70]Stop acting weird.
[227:52.92]It's not fun.
[227:59.28]What?
[228:06.80]It is here.
[228:07.26]You're right.
[228:07.58]For a second I thought I wasn't going to be there.
[228:20.21]Do we even have anything?
[228:21.01]It's the only thing I have.
[228:23.30]I guess I'll put it on.
[228:30.48]Do I have any of the items that should be on this menu here?
[228:37.33]They miss Old Germa.
[228:38.47]Old Germa was weirder than this one.
[228:40.67]What?
[228:42.07]What?
[228:51.07]If anything, I've dialed back how fucking weird of a person I am.
[228:54.51]Wait, what?
[228:55.31]We're dialing back how weird we are?
[228:57.39]Somebody said, stop being weird.
[228:58.50]And I was like, what do you mean?
[229:00.52]We're super normal.
[229:06.74]We're going in the Stargate.
[229:15.44]Kenneth, fight!
[229:18.81]Oh, Erdtree.
[229:20.75]Grant me, sucker.
[229:36.15]Oh, Erdtree.
[229:36.96]That really is Bugleberry.
[229:39.70]Oh, Erdtree.
[229:41.68]Grant me, sucker.
[229:44.06]Please.

[230:19.82]Oh, wow.
[230:21.52]Jermar got something cool again.
[230:22.84]I did.
[230:24.00]I got a golden rune.
[230:32.06]I think the scaling probably makes this boat have a lot of health.
[230:35.87]Oh, wait.
[230:36.15]The boat's out here?
[230:38.79]Yeah.
[230:39.81]Blackblade Mariner?
[230:41.37]Oh, yeah.
[230:45.92]But this guy sucks, though.
[230:47.22]It shouldn't be too bad.
[230:49.92]Holy shit.
[230:50.86]Never mind.
[230:51.32]He's going to aggro some, like, crazy enemy that's probably near here.
[231:11.58]What the fuck?
[231:16.35]What just happened to you?
[231:17.93]I got crushed.
[231:20.45]Weird, I didn't see anything hit you.

[235:42.40]so like everyone in the whole group like 12 people we're all doing it we're having a good time and I was like oh shit like oh you did better oh that guy did better and then like this dude comes over super drunk and is like yeah I do like mma dude like hey guys what's up this is my name how's it going and he like did it to like show off in front of everyone and apparently like later I saw him all night like he was watching people drunk like just sitting in a chair that could have view of that anytime anyone went over there he like asserted himself and like his whole identity was punching this thing
[236:11.40]uh it was really weird and then I went and I beat his punch oh no so he came back up to me later and was like oh yeah dude oh yeah like like telling me like all this like martial arts stuff and like trying to like I don't know like the weirdest down speak to me of like yeah you could you got this is how you actually you got to do it like this is a proper punch you learn this you know doing mma for like five years man and you just you what was your score

I could tell you I could show you how to do it if uh if we if you and I get there like if we're at a thing I could probably teach you like the right way to do it because I can do probably like 9 50 or so I notoriously know how to do that very well I could show you what's the proper technique are you are you being that guy to me right now
[237:06.07]because him his buddy and like their girlfriends were sitting in a table and any like I I don't know I felt like I wish I was his girlfriend to just understand how weird he was being anytime anyone went over to this thing this guy's waiting for this dude with the ballista is like dude you're not gonna shoot what are you shooting at I remember pick up all these items got a couple warming oh there's that

[240:18.92]It went all the way up.
[240:20.90]You went all the way up?
[240:26.52]How did you get up there again?
[240:28.78]You got to go all the way around and do some jumps.
[240:32.40]And there's a couple of items along the way.
[240:41.63]I got a whip.
[240:43.19]The horned whip.
[240:49.60]Yeah, this way.
[240:54.72]Okay, show me.

[241:39.62]smithing stone five actually that was uh I need that as well and I can go like to seven I got a whip and trousers dude things are coming together for me okay come this way kill this dude I have scarlet rod I'm dead I'm lagging too I you keep teleporting around I'm dead I'm poisoned I'm dead
[242:10.11]Are you dead for real, for real, Nocap?
[242:11.33]I'm like dead, dead.
[242:12.85]Is it respawning you?
[242:15.19]Um, I think so, yeah.
[242:19.93]Do L2 multiple times?
[242:21.01]I will.
[242:22.49]Oh, I am so far away now.
[242:25.09]What?
[242:27.59]Oh, no.
[242:32.86]I'm fuming.
[242:35.42]What?
[242:42.45]I'm gonna die too because I'm poisoned what's going on what his I thought that was you who the fuck is that I don't know somebody I can hear somebody on my screen it's like a naked dude where you died that looked kind of like you with a sword I still can't use the horse we're gonna have to reset probably hold on I think when I get to the bonfire I can we can resolve this
[243:21.80]It's okay.
[243:23.10]I vote it to travel if you can.
[243:26.02]I don't have that bonfire.
[243:29.19]That's why you spawned so far away.
[243:30.35]You never touched it.
[243:31.51]Well, I didn't have the horse and it was irritating me.
[243:33.95]You started talking about some guy punching stuff and you punching him or something.
[243:39.17]You punched the thing.
[243:41.14]Yeah, I punched the thing.
[243:43.08]And then the guy came over and told me he can punch things better.
[243:45.44]I'm right there.
[243:52.54]Wait, you forgot to put the map underground?
[243:54.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[243:55.34]That is true, right?
[243:58.93]Oh, that is true.
[244:00.13]Okay, I can.
[244:00.79]I can travel there.
[244:01.49]I forgot that that existed.
[244:07.49]Can you warp with me so I can just get down there?
[244:10.90]I want to figure out what this left bumper thing is.
[244:12.56]It doesn't do anything.
[244:20.15]because you and the horse died simultaneously to the skeleton reset okay so where's that thing you start with it was like a cool jump to get jump okay horse up I don't have a horse do I need it why don't you have a horse because it glitched out me and the horse died at the exact same time in the same frame so it broke my game one you just can I make the jump to the side
[244:49.54]uh I actually don't think you can do this without it yeah we'll do something else then we're good yeah I mean should I you're you coming yeah it just takes me an extra second you look kind of cool now yeah like I've got like a shirt I can wear
[245:20.32]How many hours do I spend in a tanning bed?
[245:23.18]A week?
[245:26.49]I have a story.
[245:28.61]So, before like PAX East, like 2014 or 2015 or something, this is like almost 10 years ago now.
[245:37.73]I, you know, as a gamer, right?
[245:40.76]As a gamer.
[245:43.02]I didn't really go out that much during the summer at this point.
[245:47.20]I was like doing YouTube videos and all this stuff, right?
[245:50.96]So I was really pale.
[245:52.48]And I was like, oh, there's going to be a bunch of YouTubers and there's other people there, a bunch of people in the industry.
[245:58.40]So I didn't want to be pale.
[246:01.70]So I went to a tanning salon and I went one time and the people behind the counter were just like, you know, this is not really going to do anything.
[246:12.94]And I'm like, yeah, but like, even if it does something at all, just a little.
[246:15.91]So I get like a little bit of color.
[246:18.23]It didn't do, I don't think it really did anything.
[246:22.18]I just went into a tanning bed for like 30 or 40 minutes.
[246:24.56]It doesn't do anything if you do it once?
[246:27.12]Apparently, you have to do it like at least a couple of times.
[246:30.93]Otherwise, it's like it doesn't really do much.
[246:33.69]So, I went to a tanning salon.
[246:37.87]Ooh.
[246:40.13]You want one of those?
[246:41.95]Want to do your third trade?
[246:43.79]Every time an item comes up?
[246:45.59]No, I'm good.
[246:47.48]So I went to a tanning bed one time, and it was, I don't know, it was just weird.
[246:51.28]I didn't like it.
[246:52.36]You just sit there and it's like, and the whole time I'm sitting there thinking, I don't, this is probably like bad.
[246:57.80]You're just laying there like, I don't actually need this.
[247:03.02]But I so badly just didn't want to, like, I feel like, I don't know, like, oh, I'm going to be going and like, there's like people I may be meeting up with or talking to people.
[247:11.75]Oh, wait, what if I do like a meetup?
[247:14.43]I wanted to, I don't know, I wanted to like, oh, hey man, I get a lot of sun, I'm, everything's good on this end.
[247:18.94]It'd be funnier if, like,
[247:22.74]It worked too well and you had like the... I was just like burnt.
[247:26.00]The circle art things and... Yeah.
[247:28.42]Like super burnt.
[247:29.66]Super burnt.
[247:30.04]And like very obviously you have just... You were just in a tanning bed.
[247:36.02]You look weird.
[247:36.52]Like I don't get those things.
[247:38.31]That is... The whole thing is weird to me.
[247:40.37]Why didn't you just go outside?
[247:41.57]Because it was... It wasn't... I couldn't get sun.
[247:45.89]It was like... I don't know what PAX it was.
[247:47.45]It was like PAX East or PAX Prime.
[247:49.15]It was one of them.
[247:49.61]It wasn't in like the summer season.
[247:53.07]Yeah, PAX East was always like really shitty weather winter.
[247:56.29]It was like February, March or something, right?
[247:58.91]Yeah, it was like May, March, but it was still shitty weather.
[248:07.02]I'm so jealous of you being able to be on a horse.
[248:11.40]Like even with you resting, you're not getting your horse back?
[248:13.32]I don't think so, no.
[248:15.72]Where's the bonfire up here?
[248:17.56]Did we get it?
[248:23.94]Why did you want to tan in winter?
[248:25.70]I didn't want to tan.
[248:27.50]I just wanted to look like, oh man, yeah, I go outside.
[248:31.44]I've gotten a little bit of sun.
[248:34.56]I'm healthy.
[248:35.65]Dude.
[248:41.19]Trying to show off?
[248:43.07]Somebody said, I haven't actually rested at a bonfire in like a half an hour.
[248:45.65]Really?
[248:48.09]Yeah, you definitely don't have your horse and you just need to rest at a bonfire.
[248:52.56]I thought there was one over here.
[248:55.75]Or is it in the next area?
[248:57.39]It's right here.
[249:03.56]Take a seat.
[249:04.50]I'm pretty sure I already did this.
[249:06.20]Take a seat.
[249:07.68]I did it already.
[249:09.52]Call your horse.
[249:12.12]Nope.
[249:15.17]It's like summoning it, but not.
[249:17.99]I think I'm seeing it and then it disappears.
[249:21.61]Do you want to load a different zone or something?
[249:25.22]I think it's just bugged.
[249:27.16]Do you want to just leave?
[249:30.38]Come back or something?
[249:32.02]I'll just disconnect and come back.
[249:35.28]I just mean like teleport to a new area.
[249:37.26]I mean, I have teleported a couple times.
[249:39.18]Yeah, I guess you could.
[249:40.13]I'm just running around picking up items here.
[249:46.47]What's going on?
[249:47.09]Oh, they got him.
[250:02.64]Gonna come back.
[250:11.54]And... Okay.
[250:14.60]Let me make sure this worked.
[250:20.32]Yeah, we haven't even taken a break, have we?
[250:21.86]We haven't, like, really walked away for any amount of time, have we?
[250:25.50]I did a PP.
[250:27.06]Okay, that fixed it.
[250:29.12]It did fix it.
[250:29.71]It was a big PP.
[250:31.31]Yo, what...
[250:45.74]I figured if you join my world, do you just appear where I am?
[250:49.52]That's a good question.
[250:50.64]Let's find out.
[250:51.66]Can you put down a thing?
[250:54.06]Jesus.
[250:55.48]Thing?
[250:57.14]Oh.
[250:57.54]Does it matter if your thing's down?
[251:00.32]Does it matter where it is?
[251:01.34]I think it is already active because of before.
[251:05.82]Let's see if it works.
[251:09.65]I may need to do the disconnect thing.
[251:11.03]Yeah, I got the horse back.
[251:17.99]Although, new problem.
[251:21.49]I cannot join your world.
[251:23.69]Okay, let me reset it.
[251:25.76]You get all your wisdom teeth taken out?
[251:35.38]Put it back down again.
[251:36.30]Make sure you're just chilling out.
[251:40.91]Why are you asking about wisdom, Keith?
[251:44.21]I was talking to somebody.
[251:46.15]Oh, okay.
[251:48.13]I'm like, I'm here.
[251:57.86]Hmm.
[252:00.40]Okay.
[252:02.90]I'm back and I have my horse.
[252:05.32]Where are you going?
[252:08.39]What the fuck?
[252:08.93]You're like glitching everywhere.
[252:13.59]All right, let's continue.
[252:20.38]I don't see where you're like, something's weird right now.
[252:23.88]Oh, I got a Glenstone staff if you want it.
[252:27.06]I think it doesn't like this area very much.
[252:32.98]You know what?
[252:35.36]I will take the Glenstone staff as one of my one things.
[252:43.90]That's a lot of runes.
[252:45.24]I think you synced up.
[252:46.08]I see you moving around now.
[252:54.19]I should just buy this just to have it.
[252:55.73]Ooh, golden seed.
[252:59.39]Fuck you.
[253:01.35]I have not found one.
[253:02.74]Talisman slots?
[253:04.10]I'm getting great rolls.
[253:05.10]I don't like this.
[253:07.46]I don't like this germa guy.
[253:08.76]Let me just go ahead and make sure I can purchase some more of this.
[253:14.86]This guy's got really good stuff for me.
[253:18.10]Do you want the glintstone staff?
[253:19.82]Yeah.
[253:23.80]Uh, how do I drop it?
[253:24.54]Uh, you go into your inventory, not your equipment.
[253:27.60]You find it and you do leave on it.
[253:30.01]Not discard.
[253:30.67]Discarding it's bad.
[253:31.65]Leaving it's good.
[253:33.95]I have the rotten crystal staff and I have the carrion glintstone staff.
[253:38.35]Uh, carrion glintstone.
[253:47.88]There you go.
[253:56.19]Should I buy this, too?
[253:56.91]Do you want to play Persona 3, for fuck's sake?
[254:05.48]Uh, this iron wet blade?
[254:07.60]This thing is probably...

[255:22.88]Okay.
[255:29.40]Oh, boy.
[255:30.01]You're going to have to give me one second while I get away from all this.

[256:35.00]That was kind of scary.
[256:38.44]I just see you hanging.
[256:39.82]I thought you killed yourself.
[256:46.09]Okay.
[256:47.51]Wait, before we do anything, I have another golden seed.
[256:55.73]I have seven flasks, dude.
[256:57.17]You only have three?
[256:59.25]I've got four now.
[257:00.09]Because I switched the one mana.
[257:03.69]But, yeah, pretty much.
[257:04.76]It's time to do this.
[257:09.80]No more messing around.
[257:10.60]This is the one.
[257:11.36]We're ready.
[257:12.08]We're prepared.
[257:13.66]We're fresh.
[257:14.28]We've leveled up.
[257:15.94]It's coming back.
[257:16.46]It's coming back.
[257:18.37]And he hit me on the opposite side of him.
[257:21.07]Once you start complaining, that's when you lose your gamer skills.
[257:27.52]Something's wrong with him.
[257:29.00]Something is wrong with this guy.
[257:49.79]Nice.
[257:53.13]Nice.
[258:08.29]Everything's good to go.
[258:09.23]Okay.
[258:21.30]Okay.
[258:22.96]Get behind him.
[258:25.81]If he starts putting a lava on his blade, we can just keep hitting him.
[258:32.51]But don't be too cocky about it.
[258:34.17]Here he comes.
[258:39.55]yeah yeah just run away from the big slam dude bro my game is having problems dude he keeps freezing
[259:09.72]This is the run, dude!
[259:19.25]I'm going in.
[259:19.61]Heck yes.
[259:27.33]Oh, heck yes.
[259:34.02]Watch that cockiness!
[259:51.66]Oh God.
[260:31.17]Watch that.
[260:31.85]Watch it.
[260:32.35]Watch it.
[260:32.65]All right.
[260:36.42]Easy.
[260:36.82]Easy.
[260:37.96]I'm going easy.
[260:38.56]He's probably going to do the spin.
[260:46.42]Is this easy mode?
[260:49.22]That's it.
[260:50.60]Yes.
[260:51.90]We got through the wall.
[260:56.44]You're going to be really mad about this, but I just got another golden seed.
[261:00.07]I got two golden seeds and the halog tree left medallion.
[261:03.85]Oh, okay.
[261:05.44]So I'm caught up.
[261:07.16]Catching up.
[261:07.96]Two seeds.
[261:10.02]Nice.
[261:13.68]That feels pretty good.
[261:14.78]And that's how you have twins.
[261:15.84]All right.
[261:22.41]Points.
[261:22.73]I need points in endurance.
[261:24.65]Why did I do this?
[261:33.36]Dex.
[261:38.14]I think I need to do it.
[261:39.44]I think I have to.
[261:44.73]Two Dex.
[261:45.45]Just do at least two Dex.
[261:48.63]Okay.
[261:49.65]No, you know what?
[261:50.13]I can fix this right now.
[261:52.07]I'm gonna fix it right now.
[261:55.87]I have 40,000 souls now.
[261:57.61]Let's fix this.
[261:59.65]You fucking piece of shit.
[262:03.31]Alright, I feel like I'm getting so many handouts from the game.
[262:06.95]Alright.
[262:08.33]Okay, this fixes it.
[262:13.17]I'm thinking... Like... 15, 12... 15...
[262:30.70]So we're like 14... 16, 12, 14.
[262:36.22]17... Like this?
[262:41.30]Are we okay?
[262:41.70]Is this gonna be alright?
[262:51.23]Sure, whatever.
[262:52.63]All strength.
[262:53.27]Fuck it.
[262:53.55]16... 16, 12, 14.
[263:01.07]Is 12 decks enough?
[263:02.71]I don't think it is.
[263:03.91]I'm an idiot.
[263:05.62]Leave decks at 12.
[263:06.68]Leave decks at 12.
[263:07.28]That's enough.
[263:07.82]That's enough.
[263:08.12]That's enough.
[263:10.86]You're an idiot.
[263:11.34]Why?
[263:13.54]I want to go to round table to upgrade my sword.
[263:15.98]I thought I couldn't do it as much, but I can upgrade it like a lot more.
[263:19.93]12 is good, dude.
[263:21.03]Dude, 18 decks, please.
[263:22.97]14.
[263:23.19]I don't know.
[263:26.29]Check the weapons.
[263:31.38]Hold on.
[263:31.72]This is really important because I'm not going to be able to level up for another four or five hours.
[263:36.70]I need to get this right.
[263:39.92]You're just going to find ten more remembrances.
[263:42.88]You say that now, but look at what you've had to deal with.
[263:47.12]Yeah, but that's me.
[263:50.72]I can use this.
[263:54.28]I can use this right now.
[263:56.60]This needs faith, but that doesn't matter.
[263:58.52]I can use this.
[263:59.82]This thing's pretty beefy.
[264:03.47]Use the pizza cutter.
[264:07.30]Pizza cutter, pizza cutter.
[264:09.22]18 dex.
[264:12.54]Use the pizza cutter.
[264:13.46]Alright, we need a poll because I'm sorry I'm going to waste a bunch of time here.
[264:17.00]Do you want me to put enough points into dex to use the pizza cutter?
[264:21.64]This is the decision we have to make.
[264:23.52]You're asking me?
[264:26.50]I mean, you can contribute if you want.
[264:29.61]Oh, well I don't care.
[264:35.88]I wonder if they even shoot if there's... Pizza cutter sucks.
[264:41.97]It's dog shit.
[264:43.35]It's so bad.
[264:43.99]Alright.
[264:45.03]I... What a bad idea.
[264:49.94]What do you want to do?
[264:51.32]I'll tell you what I want to do.
[264:54.60]Can we go do this at round table hold?
[264:55.92]Yes.
[264:56.66]Yes.
[265:12.11]Did you say to go?
[265:14.11]I did, and then it says you already voted to warp here.
[265:17.89]You voted.
[265:18.27]And then my map is frozen until like the timer runs out.
[265:22.13]Okay, it says it failed.
[265:34.55]Okay, don't do it again.
[265:36.71]Okay, I'm not doing it.
[265:37.77]Wait for me to do it.
[265:38.31]It might be like a weird host thing.
[265:39.96]Okay.
[265:46.74]That's not... That's not a big majority.
[265:50.54]Devoted.
[265:53.80]That's not... That's 53%.
[265:59.06]That's not that much.
[266:00.36]Oh, shit.
[266:01.33]What?
[266:02.47]On guard.
[266:04.11]Someone's in the round table hole.
[266:05.23]What's going on?
[266:05.71]This looks a little different, man.
[266:07.39]Why does it look so different?
[266:08.31]Actually, I have 40... I have a weapon equipped.
[266:11.37]I have 40,000 souls right now.
[266:12.57]Please kill him.
[266:28.66]Bruh, I'm trying.
[266:38.21]Thank God I was about to shit my pants.
[266:48.87]Don't we get a weapon?
[266:50.67]Don't we get something?
[266:52.93]Satisfaction.
[266:53.59]I thought you got his arm.
[266:58.25]Oh, it's over here.
[266:59.27]It's over here where he was standing.
[267:04.71]Good stuff.
[267:05.81]No one is standing anywhere.
[267:07.59]Where he used to be standing.
[267:11.71]No, my round table hold is empty.
[267:13.39]Oh, mine is too.
[267:13.99]The blacksmith is not there.
[267:15.39]You're not here.
[267:16.07]No NPCs are here.
[267:17.56]Yeah, mine is gone too.
[267:21.42]And now, can we, like, teleport?
[267:23.62]Maybe we can do it now.
[267:35.35]And... This looks... Yep, I got an item.
[267:42.69]I do not... Nobody's in here.
[267:45.73]I'm not... There's nobody here.
[267:50.68]Okay, well, you were just leveling, right?
[267:51.94]I just want to... I need to blacksmith real quick.
[267:54.89]Yeah, you... Nope, blacksmith isn't here.
[267:58.03]Weird.
[267:58.31]Okay, so let's teleport out.
[268:04.17]Should we try it again?
[268:16.84]Omen killer is a mog-type weapon.
[268:21.28]I think I'm going Omen Killer.
[268:25.17]I know that it was 53%, but you're forgetting about the streamer vote.
[268:29.41]My vote is worth 5%.
[268:30.37]And I'm going with the Mog-type weapon.
[268:38.84]I think our games are not synced.
[268:42.68]Yeah, I'm going to get out of my world.
[268:45.05]Yeah, I'll use it right now.
[268:54.18]I almost feel like it'd be easier to dismiss you from the world and then do Roundtable Hold.
[269:00.44]Yeah, let's do that.
[269:01.82]I feel like we spent so much time trying to get there that we could have already done it.
[269:06.69]So just do your thing, and then when we're done upgrading, then we'll meet back up.
[269:10.07]First chance we get, we got to find the other blacksmith that we can use so we can avoid this as well.
[269:21.89]Yeah, I am playing as Mii Strong, that's true.
[269:24.29]I can't go against the Mii Strong build.
[269:29.69]What does Omen Killer use and need?
[269:30.93]A whole lot of nothing.
[269:34.34]Do you have Smithing Stone II?
[269:37.10]Probably, let's see.
[269:39.88]I do.
[269:42.08]I have two Smithing Stone IIs.
[269:44.74]Oh, well, you're probably going to need them unless you're using a Somberstone thing.
[269:49.34]What is that?
[269:50.20]What is the Omen Killer?
[269:53.53]Ooh, this thing is pretty cool.
[269:54.87]I like it.
[270:01.68]This uses regular smithing stones, so I need it.
[270:03.88]Okay.
[270:09.76]Oh, this causes blood loss?
[270:10.96]It does?
[270:22.67]Strength Infuse it.
[270:26.61]Do I have that yet?
[270:34.23]I don't really have anything.
[270:36.29]I forgot, how do you sell things?
[270:38.23]Blacksmith.
[270:40.35]Blacksmith has a sell tab.
[270:41.77]Alright, that being said, let's go ahead and do this.
[270:54.72]Because I need it so bad, right?
[270:56.64]I've got X12 Dexterity.
[271:02.54]This is good.
[271:05.99]I've got to get my Vigor up and my Endurance.
[271:12.93]Okay.
[271:14.03]Much better.
[271:21.39]Well, I took you for no matter.
[271:23.49]It's all about your arms.
[271:35.41]Now this is faith scaling.
[271:43.79]When are you going to win your guilty gear tournament?
[271:47.56]Are you asking you that?
[271:50.34]I think they're just saying words directed at you in hopes that you'll read them.
[272:02.53]Oh, that's right.
[272:03.19]You can do that, right?
[272:04.51]Okay.
[272:05.60]I forgot you could do that.
[272:06.18]150, 41, 130, 61.
[272:21.18]all right I am now prepared I'm completely ready can I level up one more time okay I thought I had more stuff than I thought I had but I didn't have the things I thought I had I'm just selling the rune arc I don't care
[272:56.68]Why not?
[272:59.68]Actually, I thought there were a thousand, not 200.
[273:00.98]Okay, where are we going to meet up?
[273:15.85]Wherever you feel like.
[273:18.27]We can do the rest of the castle that we just unlocked.
[273:21.41]Let's do that.
[273:23.52]Oh, and I need to re-invite you to my world.
[273:25.18]So I'm going to go back to Margit and invite.
[273:29.40]My seal is down.
[273:45.04]Make sure you use the humanity before you try and reconnect.
[273:48.06]And I'm standing exactly over here if you can find my sign.
[273:56.41]What do I need?
[274:00.13]Sell the pizza cutter?
[274:01.63]I might have seller's remorse if I do that.
[274:06.62]I need to make sure.
[274:07.42]7,800.
[274:10.88]Come on.
[274:11.52]I'm almost ready.
[274:12.98]We should pee, too.
[274:13.90]We should, like, go to the bathroom.
[274:15.04]I have not got... I did pee.
[274:17.12]You can do whatever you want.
[274:18.16]Okay.
[274:18.72]You know, I... I peed.
[274:23.27]I peed for, like, three minutes straight.
[274:28.29]But there are also a lot of items here.
[274:30.28]Like at the gate castle.
[274:31.88]Yeah.
[274:33.16]And they're all scattered on the floor and you can just open up the main gate because there's no one manning the ballistas.
[274:37.78]That's pretty good.
[274:38.28]All right.
[274:41.90]I'm going to take a quick pee break.
[274:43.74]I will be right back.
[274:45.76]Give me like two minutes.
[274:48.87]I might refill this drink to this water.
[274:50.83]I might get some more water.
[274:52.55]There was tea in here earlier, but I'm going to replace it with water.
[274:54.65]I'll be right back.
[281:01.89]Oh, yeah.
[281:05.51]Hello.
[281:07.85]I'm sorry, everybody.
[281:09.09]Are you?
[281:09.49]Hello?
[281:11.33]Are you?
[281:11.69]Are you?
[281:13.81]That was that was okay.
[281:15.17]All right, we good.
[281:17.23]You ready to get this?
[281:18.57]Yeah.
[281:20.67]I think Yeah, I'm I've got my sign up.
[281:22.97]I'm just waiting for you to join.
[281:26.40]Can you use in a piggy?
[281:43.49]Jeremy just ate a fistful of edibles.
[281:45.35]I did not.
[281:49.65]All right, so I got my new weapon.
[281:50.95]What is the actual?
[281:56.68]What is that?
[281:58.82]Oh, wait, that's pretty cool.
[282:00.86]Looks like a holy buff.
[282:06.10]I have, all right.
[282:08.68]Attack power with successive attacks.
[282:14.17]He's fully ready.
[282:15.13]All right, let's go.
[282:17.81]Where are you?
[282:18.91]Oh, there are so many items here.
[282:20.07]Oh, he's going right front door.
[282:34.35]Yeah, just grab all this shit.
[282:38.08]I don't know if you want to go around and just do the other stuff and pick up items as well we can do that we should probably I'm more used to that route yeah I got golden kill him kill him oh kill him no I'm kidding don't you should because he steals souls from you what
[283:14.10]Did you get his ball bearing?
[283:16.04]Yeah.
[283:17.56]Which is good if you take that to the shop ladies, the maidens.
[283:21.80]Then his shop is still randomized at them.
[283:23.78]But you do miss out on the last smithing stone available.
[283:28.85]I don't know if that was a good idea.
[283:32.65]It was a great idea.
[283:35.95]What last smithing stone?
[283:37.58]His store has the last, like, dragon smithing stone in it at the end of the game.
[283:42.30]His shit's all randomized.
[283:46.46]Yeah, but I mean in, like, the regular playthrough, not in this one.
[283:50.14]Okay.
[283:50.38]I'm just saying that's... Is this a regular playthrough right now?
[283:54.31]No, I'm just saying in regular playthrough, you don't... He stays around.
[283:59.55]Well, actually... Are you for real right now, dude?
[284:04.51]You're not going to make it to the endgame.
[284:07.67]We might not, but whatever.
[284:15.18]Spinning Stone 3!
[284:17.90]No, Demihuman Mobs.
[284:23.51]What?
[284:23.73]This thing's pretty good.
[284:39.07]Reeves.
[284:53.51]Epic.
[284:54.07]That guy was strong.
[284:57.57]Sorry.
[284:58.43]Is this cutscene up here going to screw everything up?
[285:03.66]Decent odds.
[285:04.74]Wait, no, no, no.
[285:05.30]We killed him.
[285:08.07]Yeah, we also killed him.
[285:11.41]He can't close us in the... He's a mean guy.
[285:23.24]He'll never become Elden Lord.
[285:24.92]I mean, if he just ran up there after everything died.
[285:29.94]Put the crown on or whatever, it'd work.
[285:36.38]Explosives!
[285:38.21]yo I am getting the smithing stones this is I'm ramping can you get out of the way
[286:01.94]You talking to me?
[286:05.20]We might need a full reset soon.
[286:07.00]Because every 30 seconds, you're kind of just teleporting.
[286:28.88]He's strong.
[286:33.19]Yes.
[286:34.19]Be strong.
[286:37.75]Watch out.
[286:38.73]Misbegotten.
[286:50.60]He's kind of stuck up there.
[286:51.90]Let's see what happens.
[286:56.32]Watch out.
[287:03.08]watch out uh talisman pouch what is that again is that for more room more talismans yes crystal spear I kind of like that yo actual intelligence man yeah maybe
[287:35.14]Cool.
[287:35.46]I like my character now.
[287:37.38]What changed?
[287:37.80]I put on regular just slacks and like a cool cape and a wolf head.
[287:46.29]Oh, okay.
[287:46.91]That's all it took.
[287:48.27]A nice pair of slacks.
[287:49.33]We got a raid?
[287:50.15]Oh, a raid did come in.
[287:52.45]From Snapscube.
[287:54.88]Welcome, everybody.
[287:57.04]Playing Elden Ring.
[287:59.64]Co-op.
[288:00.28]Seamless co-op mod.
[288:02.64]I don't know why I just swallowed weird
[288:06.39]Human body is a wonder.
[288:12.95]It's been pretty good so far.
[288:14.33]I'll say it's been.
[288:16.55]When we first were talking about doing this, I was actually pretty scared that this was going to be every five minutes we were going to crash or oh, I do saying reset it.
[288:25.20]This is been pretty great, I'd say.
[288:32.36]He fell except for that right there, but that was it happens sometimes.
[288:35.54]It's OK.
[288:39.83]You fell.
[288:40.71]Is everyone falling?
[288:41.45]I just... I'm working through something right now.
[288:48.55]I got... Oh, I can upgrade my sword a lot.
[288:51.64]Smithing Stone 2 times 3.
[288:55.20]You're getting a lot of those.
[288:56.08]I'm not getting any.
[288:57.66]Yeah, I'm... I think I could hit like plus 15 right now if I go upgrade.
[289:01.93]Could you just... Do you know the button?
[289:14.58]Oh, God.
[289:16.12]Oh, God.
[289:16.58]What is that?
[289:17.58]I forgot there's an enemy that, like, jump scares you there.
[289:21.26]And it's a fucking bear.
[289:24.77]I pressed it.
[289:25.77]I swear to God.
[289:26.93]I pressed it.
[289:34.13]You would not do that three times.
[289:36.71]Gameplay on my stream.
[289:38.65]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[289:40.83]I pressed it.
[289:41.71]All right, dude.
[289:51.59]Where are you?
[289:54.33]Behind you.
[289:55.59]You got to do another jump.
[290:02.45]You think you're so funny.
[290:04.71]I didn't think about it until the very end, but I'm like, dude, I could just, I could get him.
[290:10.16]I could get him real good here.
[290:11.10]Holy shit, a bear is up here.
[290:12.98]What the heck?
[290:13.72]Nice reaction.
[290:17.24]That was a good react.
[290:20.78]One of the one of the best all time reacts.
[290:22.60]This actually is a pretty hard spot in the regular game.
[290:25.98]Yeah, and the lore.
[290:27.77]The halberd, the kind of winged knight that's up there is actually really annoying.
[290:38.83]I just got some pants for real.
[290:42.79]I'm not even joking.
[290:45.59]I've got pants.
[290:52.06]Well, that's a way easier enemy to deal with.
[291:06.69]There's a hole there if you want to... If you need like a choke.
[291:11.43]I'm fine.
[291:27.18]Yeah, we probably... I don't know when you want to do it, but... You are... We are... Our connection together is not fantastic right now.
[291:36.97]Let's end here and I can go upgrade my sword.
[291:39.19]I'll kick you out.
[291:40.03]Okay, kick me out and reset the game.
[291:42.65]You know what I mean?
[291:45.01]Reset the game game.
[291:46.31]Reset the game game.
[291:49.77]You look golden and crispy.
[291:51.19]Why do you look deep fried?
[291:54.99]You been in a tanning booth?
[292:02.13]All right, you kicked me out, right?
[292:03.83]Yeah.
[292:04.51]I'm going to like quit and reset.
[292:06.51]I'm going to actually restart the whole game.
[292:11.19]Like to desktop.
[292:13.01]I suggest you do it, too.
[292:13.91]I feel like we haven't had a refresh in a little while.
[292:18.42]You're calling for a full refresh.
[292:20.68]I am calling for a full refresh.
[292:35.05]okay on back dude um gamer mode was just activated dude my long sword went from 5 to plus 14. oh official gamer wait I can still go further I just don't have the souls uh we might have a problem what's the problem
[293:06.82]I can't open the game anymore.
[293:08.86]What is it saying?
[293:09.82]Because I just activated gamer mode.
[293:13.81]I don't know if you heard.
[293:20.85]Maybe time for a full reset?
[293:23.43]Yeah.
[293:24.63]Let me do this again and make sure this is not going to be a problem.
[293:33.43]Okay, we're okay.
[293:36.73]Oh, thank God.
[293:37.23]All right.
[293:37.77]For a second, I got like a hard crash with the red stop sign and the white X in the middle.
[293:44.71]And it was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, a bunch of bullshit.
[293:46.51]And I was like, this is bad.
[293:48.35]So, we're good.
[293:55.44]Did you do a reset?
[293:58.72]Yeah.
[293:59.96]You're lying.
[294:00.62]No, you didn't.
[294:04.32]Okay, doing a full reset.
[294:06.86]I got my sword to plus 16, Jermo.
[294:09.71]I'm very excited to use it.
[294:12.25]I'm going to do a raid with you.
[294:15.01]Yeah.
[294:15.99]Like a WoW raid, not like a Twitch raid.
[294:21.36]People make fun of me for doing WoW references.
[294:24.58]I hope they do it to you too.
[294:27.20]I don't know anything about WoW.
[294:28.06]I was doing that for you.
[294:29.62]Oh, okay.
[294:30.66]Thanks.
[294:34.03]I am going to go back to... Oh yeah, remember you need to launch with the dot back.
[294:38.21]That's why you were getting errors.
[294:39.99]I think I did it right.
[294:41.60]So we're going to the Rampart Tower, right?
[294:45.08]Yeah.
[294:51.90]I am ready.
[294:53.64]Hopefully a full reset will fix the teleporting problem.
[294:56.68]Because you were kind of just... I want to say every 30 seconds or so, every enemy and you would freeze.
[295:02.06]And then 10, 5 seconds later, it'd be like... Everything would just kind of catch up.
[295:07.27]Okay.
[295:10.49]Hope this fixes it.
[295:16.02]so how are you how you feel are you good how do I feel I feel great I feel like I'm I'm at the top of my class like I'm getting straight a's but I just put down my uh my thing you can join I'm talking about like playing this and streaming this you you're good to go we'll keep going right I'm I just got the plus 16 or I want to hit some things with my new sword I'm I'm down to stay here for a little while too okay I was just checking in I just want to hit something with my sword
[295:45.92]OK.
[295:47.40]We're good.
[295:48.58]Let's go.
[295:49.16]Oh my God.
[295:57.09]I think I know about that too.
[296:00.97]I'm the one that came up with that.
[296:03.49]You actually are the originator.
[296:06.08]You don't think I know that skip?
[296:16.10]This is a good guy over here.
[296:18.28]Hey.
[296:19.25]Hey, you.
[296:19.51]Isn't this a really scary big like bird enemy?
[296:22.55]Yeah.
[296:24.45]The awful like we made this game, but we also didn't want you to enjoy a bird enemy.
[296:45.20]Dude, look at this damage.
[296:48.58]What sword?
[296:48.98]Is that just a regular sword?
[296:50.01]Oh, my God.
[296:50.75]That actually was a lot.
[296:53.53]How much was that?
[296:54.39]It was 570.
[296:58.43]What?
[297:00.27]Oh, I definitely have to put that on.
[297:01.43]All right, that's perfect.
[297:07.33]Don't worry.
[297:08.12]Stand behind me.
[297:09.16]I've never even seen this.
[297:12.76]Does this have any attributes on it?
[297:18.71]No.
[297:20.05]Just goofy.
[297:20.49]I said, insane drip.
[297:28.42]You're looking fresh.
[297:29.56]I look like I belong in a Katamari game.
[297:38.43]Keep going.
[297:53.00]Nice line, nice line.
[297:54.04]There's been a lot of bugs.
[297:55.88]We have like an ant seed.
[297:58.18]One shot.
[297:58.56]Alright, now we definitely are going to be able to beat this whole game.
[298:02.72]Right?
[298:02.92]Like, if that's the case.
[298:04.65]I ascend it.
[298:07.29]This is a glintstone pebble.
[298:08.45]I can't believe you just killed that.
[298:17.01]I hate him.
[298:26.35]Watch out.
[298:26.85]Dragons ahead.
[298:27.51]That's a flag.
[298:35.68]In my first playthrough, I was looking at my menu, and that swept down like that, and I thought it was a dragon tail, and I screamed.
[298:42.14]That's pretty crazy.
[298:44.56]I've never noticed it.
[298:53.89]Oh, shit.
[298:54.29]We got a bow boy.
[298:57.72]That actually is one of the harder ones, isn't it?
[299:06.41]Honestly, you should just... You're doing 600 plus damage?
[299:12.41]Yeah.
[299:18.07]Oh my goodness.
[299:19.03]I'm so glad I didn't get hit by that.
[299:20.71]I thought I had another weapon in my other hand.
[299:35.30]Whirl.
[299:36.06]Oh, flame.
[299:40.85]Oh, he's too short.
[299:42.67]He's too short.
[299:44.23]You got to fight him.
[299:50.70]All my swings just went over his head.
[299:52.30]I got him.
[299:59.72]Cool.
[299:59.88]This is a fun game.
[300:04.89]Should I play this game normally?
[300:06.25]I haven't... This is the first time I've really played it.
[300:08.37]Is this like a...
[300:12.10]um I actually wouldn't really recommend it alone it's like too hard and like I don't it's not even like fun are they just exhausting are there this many enemies that are spawned in and stuff or is it are they how does it work normally uh this is about the same like really it's just the co-op thing yeah like a lot of a lot of this you're thinking that but a lot of the spawns in this game don't really make any sense
[300:37.18]They put crabs next to sorcerers and stuff.
[300:40.60]It's kind of just spam enemies.
[300:41.66]You should rest.
[300:44.52]I'm trying to make you remember when we played Terraria together.
[300:49.76]No, I remember.
[300:50.35]I brought it up earlier.
[300:54.23]Again, everyone, I'd like to apologize for making Jerma play a great game and having a fun time with him.
[300:59.75]I'd like to sincerely just say I'm sorry.
[301:02.57]There was a lot of minus twos that just didn't even understand what was going on right there.
[301:08.50]For those of you that don't know, Ster and I played Terraria together.
[301:10.90]And it was me just watching him play with like a thousand mods.
[301:14.60]And I've never played Terraria before.
[301:16.08]And I was just like, is this game like fun normally?
[301:17.98]And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[301:19.38]But like, don't worry.
[301:20.02]Just come over here.
[301:23.31]Here, take all these items.
[301:31.35]Nothing wrong with just watching.
[301:32.49]All you guys are just watching.
[301:33.67]Hey, I had a good time.
[301:34.47]It was fun.
[301:42.64]I remember... It really was so funny because I remember half the time I would just be like, hey, I'd be up in the base and you'd be down adventuring somewhere, just collecting ore, like the one specific ore that you needed.
[302:02.38]And... Whoa!
[302:05.52]Wait a minute.
[302:06.40]Wait a minute.
[302:07.02]Wait a minute.
[302:07.84]I think that... Did we just both get a great drop?
[302:10.04]Yeah.
[302:10.83]I think that's a... I got a fantastic drop.
[302:14.19]Who is doing that?
[302:16.21]Oh, it's one of those omens.
[302:17.35]Hold on.
[302:21.11]From where, though?
[302:24.92]Is it an omen?
[302:25.48]No.
[302:28.58]All the way up there.
[302:29.52]Ignore him.
[302:30.06]Yeah, that guy we killed earlier, but he respawned.
[302:32.84]Let's just get this bonfire and then go up the other way.
[302:39.93]I think this thing is really, really good.
[302:47.99]Oh my goodness.
[302:49.95]50 strength.
[302:51.23]I could almost do that.
[303:02.96]What about the int?
[303:06.13]I can respec when we do the academy.
[303:12.67]Yeah, we already have the key.
[303:13.85]Yeah.
[303:15.59]Good for now.
[303:23.97]No, me strong doesn't have intelligence.
[303:31.25]Ooh, I like that.
[303:33.93]I like your outfit.
[303:35.31]There we go.
[303:35.75]I was waiting.
[303:36.41]Okay.
[303:37.51]That's my good drop.
[303:40.55]You're just missing the default green tunic.
[303:47.21]Well, I'm kind of like an epic bar face.
[303:56.42]The Glintstone Pebbler.
[304:02.60]We're at Godric, aren't we?
[304:04.84]Yeah.
[304:05.14]He's right through here.
[304:24.54]Magic missile!
[304:25.49]Magic missile!
[304:32.77]Secure that for you.
[304:33.91]Secure that kill.
[304:35.15]What?
[304:37.85]My game keeps lagging.
[304:44.23]Are you on the Wi-Fi?
[304:45.67]Yeah, but it's a good Wi-Fi router.
[304:50.60]I have like 5 to 10 megabytes down.
[304:54.68]Oh, the Gigamat?
[304:59.25]The Bamco gigamap?
[305:00.93]I just don't think... I think this mod does not like the bigger open areas.
[305:04.85]It does... Like when we load a new zone, sometimes it freezes and wiggles.
[305:12.86]It hasn't been that bad for me.
[305:18.92]Hmm.
[305:20.04]Cool, but I don't need it.
[305:24.87]Oh!
[305:26.15]Yo!
[305:27.67]What did you get?
[305:28.95]Mushroom arms.
[305:31.15]Ooh.
[305:32.77]Can't really see them.
[305:34.26]No, I'm not on the Wi-Fi.
[305:36.00]It's an item over here.
[305:50.35]What is it?
[305:50.79]I am going to one-shot Godric.
[305:55.93]I hope you do.
[305:56.51]Let's heal fist.
[305:59.67]Well, Godric is going to be a dog.
[306:03.52]Uh, we're aggroing like every single thing here.
[306:07.90]It's probably not a good idea.
[306:13.99]Oh my god.
[306:28.73]I've run out of magics.
[306:31.93]Oh, these fuckers.
[306:32.83]He almost got me.
[306:54.39]Got a larval here.
[306:56.89]I have one too, so that's awesome.
[306:59.18]Oh, okay.
[306:59.58]I thought you were looking for one.
[307:01.18]Yeah, I got one.
[307:01.68]I actually got one really early.
[307:03.32]It was like, I want to say the first like half hour we were playing.
[307:07.72]First hour.
[307:08.08]Okay.
[307:21.13]Candlestand.
[307:22.03]I'm getting a lot of random weapons now.
[307:25.49]Yeah, I think we're pretty set to just do content.
[307:39.08]Oh painting.
[307:46.66]Damn cursed sword.
[307:48.11]Great mace is that should I use that?
[307:56.24]Oh yeah, some blood weapon.
[307:57.22]Fuck that.
[308:03.65]How did I just break that myself?
[308:05.25]I don't know.
[308:08.07]You can power stance then.
[308:11.21]Dude, this thing gave me three awesome items.
[308:20.54]I prefer the mace.
[308:31.51]Another one?
[308:32.81]Gargoyle's greataxe?
[308:34.59]Another one.
[308:36.07]That might be better than what I have right now.
[308:38.73]Have you have you plus one a single weapon?
[308:41.75]Yeah, I'm holding right now.
[308:50.24]You should do a weld.
[309:04.17]You want me to dual weld?
[309:04.89]Dual weld huge weapons?
[309:07.81]I think dual welding is definitely dangerous, especially if you don't have a mask for it.
[309:16.64]If you do jump attacks, they're really strong.
[309:23.78]Oh, my God, that seems amazing.
[309:27.98]I'm actually going to do this for a minute.
[309:33.09]Uh-oh.
[309:34.29]Little gross boy.
[309:35.15]Didn't even see that until it started moving.
[309:41.68]Oh, we got one of, like, I hate these enemies.
[309:43.56]Oh, yeah.
[309:44.56]There's been a lot of I hate these enemies thrown out there today.
[309:47.12]This is a real... This one takes the cake.
[309:51.94]Uh, this is bad.
[309:52.88]This is actually not good.
[309:55.04]This is gonna be harder than the boss.
[309:56.46]It probably will be.
[309:56.93]Right now.
[309:57.97]And I'm getting killed by a fucking one singular gargoyle.
[310:05.23]I love the slap.
[310:07.83]Oh my fucker fucking fucks.
[310:20.95]What the fuck?
[310:21.41]What was that?
[310:21.89]I think it was one of the enemies.
[310:24.05]Are you okay?
[310:29.56]Yeah, I'm good.
[310:35.09]Watch out.
[310:35.35]There's like this one gargoyle up there.
[310:37.39]You're not going to want to fight that guy.
[310:39.59]Okay.
[310:41.46]It might have even been this one.
[310:42.76]He's killing me again.
[310:43.94]Oh, shit with the dog.
[310:53.49]You're a whimper.
[310:54.39]I'm doing all strength and endurance and I'm going to do a weld.
[311:09.91]He's sitting up on this stupid fence post thing and I can't hit him.
[311:13.52]Fight the other stuff.
[311:20.82]Dude, this is a shit show of an... This is... I don't think we can walk by here.
[311:29.30]You don't run up there.
[311:30.98]Don't start hitting the thing sitting on the spike.
[311:34.54]We got a dual weld.
[311:35.50]Okay, hold on.
[311:39.35]Minus 5,000 souls, by the way.
[311:41.05]What do you mean?
[311:41.61]Me or who?
[311:42.52]Me?
[311:44.38]I'm still alive still.
[311:45.08]Okay, kill this gurgle.
[311:54.47]One at a time.
[311:55.05]Okay, I can magic bolt the ass sitter.
[312:06.70]And I don't know what is shooting that, like, giant blob of poison.
[312:09.71]I have no idea.
[312:13.21]This other thing, the guy with the crown?
[312:17.19]I don't think we can fight this.
[312:20.08]We can, it's just... We gotta, like, 1v1 and not be, like, perma-staggered when he comes out here.
[312:26.84]Or 2v1.
[312:27.48]Because I'm always fighting some other shit while you're fighting it.
[312:46.21]Oh, it's him doing that.
[312:48.37]Oh, my God.
[312:49.17]Look at the surface area.
[312:50.71]The surface area is insane.
[313:04.45]There we go.
[313:04.99]And it made me realize there's a good item back here.
[313:06.73]Flail.
[313:12.06]I don't want to reset this, but I'm poisoned.
[313:13.78]Hopefully.
[313:14.14]How long?
[313:14.62]I'm good.
[313:15.26]Do not.
[313:15.86]We're good.
[313:27.27]Nothing up there.
[313:29.25]You are.
[313:29.65]Okay.
[313:29.75]Bye.
[313:55.91]You good?
[313:56.91]Hold on.
[313:57.63]I got the finger.
[314:04.39]Well.
[314:07.14]I think I know what has to happen now, right?
[314:18.40]I don't know what needs to happen.
[314:19.84]This is the weapon I'm using.
[314:22.49]All right.
[314:23.07]I mean, I'm pretty settled in what I got.
[314:25.23]I'm comfortable.
[314:31.22]Can I dual weld?
[314:31.82]It didn't look like I could swing both.
[314:40.09]Is it like a joke how you pronounce that?
[314:42.39]Is that like a running gag or is it real?
[314:45.09]What do you mean?
[314:46.21]Dual weld.
[314:47.81]Dual welding?
[314:48.59]Dual wielding.
[314:49.53]Dual welding.
[315:01.61]did I kill it yeah dual wield dual wielding you almost sound like when you say it that way you're trying to do like the uwu dual wielding
[315:19.12]This weapon sucks.
[315:21.34]The finger?
[315:21.85]This thing's dumb.
[315:23.41]It didn't even hurt anything.
[315:25.27]Actually, it's kind of good.
[315:25.91]Never mind.
[315:27.93]Okay.
[315:28.45]Changed your tune pretty quick there, buddy.
[315:31.85]All right.
[315:35.03]Are we ready?
[315:35.47]No, let's go up the stairs the other direction and get those items and just look what's up there.
[315:42.49]Do a wee bit of a rest.
[315:48.80]Let me put a point into, what do you think?
[315:50.97]Strength?
[315:51.55]Of course.
[315:51.97]Wait.
[315:53.07]Endurance.
[316:04.72]I love how this greatly increases your maximum FP, and it is as much... I don't think they can even cast one spell.
[316:18.60]It's because it's percent based.
[316:20.46]Yeah.
[316:38.30]It's really not.
[316:39.02]I need to like upgrade it.
[316:42.77]Upgrading things is pretty good.
[316:56.82]know what's really actually good about this is you don't get staggered if you take damage while you do it oh is it one of those those are really good it seems pretty good okay where did you go bro are you on the wi-fi I went back down to the bonfire
[317:23.60]Oh, I rest it.
[317:24.34]Oh.
[317:25.26]All right.
[317:41.55]I don't look funny enough.
[317:46.29]Can you can you step up your comedy right now?
[317:48.71]I haven't laughed in like an hour.
[317:50.31]I know.
[317:50.81]Like, what the fuck, dude?
[317:53.53]I think this is pretty good, actually.
[317:57.61]You feel like... I like your face.
[318:02.02]I miss my face.
[318:03.38]I only wore this for you.
[318:05.02]Do you want it?
[318:07.22]I'm not going... You think I'm going to try to pretend to be one of the most celebrated people on planet Earth?
[318:13.69]No, there's only one barf... I'm actually kind of offended that you did that.
[318:16.99]Did what?
[318:18.63]Nobody can be barf drinker besides barf drinker.
[318:21.01]okay well I'm no longer barf drinker I apologize I thought you'd think it was like funny and we'd have like oh you're barf sorry I don't I didn't see what it was uh we skipping or we uh we uh story watchers we are mighty dragon skipping skipping true born air can't skip it oh it's god free the grafted oh shit this might not be that bad though
[318:50.50]This was one of the dumber ones.
[318:55.23]Look at that.
[318:57.95]Oh my God, dude.
[318:58.89]Just stand there and cast.
[319:00.69]Glintstone.
[319:02.13]Glintstone.
[319:03.65]Glintstone.
[319:05.49]Glintstone Pebble.
[319:07.67]I'm out.
[319:10.90]Shit.
[319:13.78]I'm going to die.
[319:27.79]Alright, I gotta stop using the comedy move.
[319:33.97]Thee, stop!
[319:35.73]What?
[319:36.13]He's actually teleporting.
[319:37.58]That's what I'm saying.
[319:44.42]Finger him!
[319:45.36]Wait.
[319:45.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[319:46.14]Let me get the last hit.
[319:47.36]Finger him!
[319:52.31]What the fuck, dude?
[319:53.25]What?
[319:53.99]What?
[319:54.37]What?
[319:54.71]What?
[319:55.65]And one day...
[319:57.90]I got four golden seeds.
[320:01.52]What?
[320:01.88]Are you kidding me?
[320:03.36]What did you get?
[320:04.71]I got a heater shield.
[320:06.23]And... I didn't even care.
[320:10.21]I didn't even... Well, at least you got cool stuff.
[320:16.41]Yeah, I don't know if I would be betting against this right now.
[320:18.85]He has an absolutely jacked up glintstone.
[320:23.60]Why are you doing that much damage?
[320:24.86]I don't understand.
[320:25.66]How are you doing that?
[320:27.37]um because it is a weapon art it's not the actual spell and then the weapon art spells are tied to the upgrade level of your weapon and my weapon's plus 16 magic glintstone pebble sword jesus like if it was an actual glintstone pebble spell it wouldn't be doing that much
[320:59.89]Okay.
[321:00.49]Let's go find some bosses.
[321:02.17]Hold on.
[321:02.73]I can level up one more time.
[321:06.53]I got 20 vigor.
[321:08.85]I can do just dump into strength now.
[321:11.10]I think that's the plan.
[321:18.90]Plus 10 finger would be sick.
[321:22.84]Maybe I'll do it.
[321:23.98]Do you need any smithing stones?
[321:25.39]I have quite a lot of sombers.
[321:27.15]You could probably get you up to like a
[321:28.94]Does this use?
[321:29.72]Yeah, what does this use?
[321:31.24]Is it somber or is it regular?
[321:32.22]I don't know.
[321:41.17]This thing's kind of a piece of shit, though.
[321:44.09]Strength D, Dex D, I mean, this thing kind of sucks.
[321:55.58]I know I'm so indecisive.
[321:56.56]I have to pick something.
[321:59.84]usually again I think we actually switch personalities because usually this would be me I picked up a default long sword and it was like that's that's the one what about this thing though I expected that if we played together you'd be using a whip so this is uh an upgrade really yeah
[322:27.40]Okay, I will keep the finger for a comedy weapon, but I'm going to probably upgrade the ruins greatsword.
[322:32.25]I think that's the plan.
[322:35.69]Okay.
[322:36.49]Okay.
[322:39.79]In the meantime, let me put the actual thing that I had.
[322:42.15]Yeah, it's just for now.
[322:57.83]Nobody here.
[322:58.37]No one's here.
[322:59.80]Sit in the chair.
[323:01.18]Oh my god.
[323:01.68]Don't.
[323:02.26]Don't.
[323:02.64]Get out of that chair.
[323:04.04]You haven't earned it.
[323:04.90]I didn't sit in it.
[323:05.70]You lagged because you're on a fucking 28k modem.
[323:09.81]I'm on a 45 180.
[323:10.19]I forget where you go here.
[323:37.16]cool you still haven't landed okay that's funny I got my rivers of blood but I'm more of a default long sword kind of guy
[323:54.50]I mean, I know you pretty well at this point.
[323:57.93]But it is kind of interesting that we're playing randomizer.
[324:01.25]And you're like, yeah, I'll take just the regular longsword.
[324:05.25]I haven't really found anything else that made sense.
[324:08.93]I did want to be a spellcaster.
[324:10.17]We haven't found anything.
[324:11.27]I got a crystal spear, but they kind of suck.
[324:18.41]Man, there is...
[324:20.34]I didn't want to overcomplicate it even more, but I think there's an option in the randomizer that when you find an item, it also has like a random ash of war and they can be, um, get like some really weird combination items.
[324:30.77]This is the guy that... I have to tell you... Is that guy right?
[324:41.32]Yes, it is.
[324:41.60]If you say so.
[324:44.89]Donate 10 runes, sure.
[324:53.39]Ooh, ancient death rancor.
[325:01.64]Kill him.
[325:01.86]Let's make a path to the graveyard.
[325:06.46]I just realized that this is not the outfit he's supposed to have on.
[325:26.89]Bubble people.
[325:27.57]I think we can just go straight to Ray Lucario because we have the keys.
[325:38.06]Yeah, we do.
[325:41.88]Pretty far away, though.
[325:44.98]Now you like go down this hill and then you're out into the lake.
[326:01.40]Hmm.
[326:03.67]What's on your food radar?
[326:05.87]What should I get?
[326:06.87]What should I do?
[326:08.43]What's on my food radar for your radar?
[326:11.19]Yeah, like what are you thinking?
[326:15.08]What am I thinking that you should eat?
[326:16.58]Lasagna.
[326:20.06]No.
[326:22.08]Well, if you don't want to hear it.
[326:25.85]Lasagna?
[326:26.99]That's not...
[326:28.93]Oh, hey, a McDonald's or a pizza.
[326:31.56]I'm not going to make a fucking lasagna.
[326:35.88]Not right now.
[326:38.64]Actually, that sounds pretty good.
[326:43.87]That takes a lot of time.
[326:46.31]It does.
[326:46.83]It takes a very long time.
[326:49.73]Let's just keep riding.
[326:50.79]You're going to have to kill this thing.
[326:53.03]I'm not killing it.
[326:57.99]So were you going to upgrade that?
[326:59.01]Because again, I might actually have all the way to plus 10 somber smithing stones.
[327:03.26]Maybe.
[327:03.82]I haven't decided yet.
[327:06.40]But somebody said you can't drop stones.
[327:11.11]Really?
[327:11.37]I don't know if they're lying or not.
[327:23.58]you can't apparently you cannot drop uh spitting stones on the ground sorry hold on this is not in the right spot now it is okay I'll just keep them for when I find something this is my favorite part of the randomizer so far is opening up these merchant loot boxes
[327:49.88]He's got a lantern for me.
[327:51.08]Thank God.
[327:51.66]Yeah.
[327:52.62]But I can't afford it.
[327:54.32]I think stone one.
[327:55.10]I'll take it.
[327:58.68]Uh, Glenstone craftsman's cookbook.
[328:00.44]Do you want this?
[328:03.87]Well, the cookbooks I think are also random.
[328:07.57]Why is this so expensive?
[328:17.63]Actually, that's something we probably should have been checking.
[328:21.99]forget how the cooking even works wait a minute this is I can buy there's an unlimited amount of these boiled crab I can buy there's about 20 of them
[328:49.18]Okay, I'm going to mark this because you know the boiled crab?
[328:56.89]Boiled crab.
[328:57.69]Boiled crab is a greatly boost physical damage negation for a time.
[329:04.11]These are apparently really, really hard to come by.
[329:07.51]And they're 250, and I'm going to buy like 500 of them.
[329:11.06]Sounds like cheating.
[329:13.94]It is.
[329:16.84]I guess I take the bell, right?
[329:17.80]Okay.
[329:19.99]all right um where to um straight to lucaria uh oh the pokemon I think that's his name isn't there a uh got the map um um he's hitting me he's hitting me anyone stop hitting me I can't help you I'm fine I still don't have a plus one to my flask
[329:53.80]What happened?
[329:55.52]That was really weird.
[329:56.54]Okay, I'm alright.
[330:13.81]The... Bonfire.
[330:16.87]Bonfire?
[330:17.55]Right here.
[330:19.04]Yeah, this one's fake.
[330:20.04]This one's actually fake.
[330:21.12]This one doesn't work.
[330:21.86]This one's not real.
[330:22.72]They should have added mimic graces that, like, attack you and shit.
[330:30.00]Isn't this portal, if you go in here, teleports you all the way up to the door?
[330:34.54]Or is it a different one?
[330:37.92]I don't remember.
[330:38.49]Ooh, legendary!
[330:40.37]Really?
[330:43.45]Yeah, travel.
[330:44.27]Go in there?
[330:45.63]Yeah.
[330:46.53]Oh, God.
[330:58.15]Where are we going?
[331:05.02]He doesn't even talk to me anymore.
[331:08.34]What?
[331:11.01]Did you go on the portal?
[331:11.91]Yep.
[331:13.29]Okay.
[331:27.73]man I'm getting the good good stuff I'm gonna be the elden lord you probably are and it's annoying because look at how cool you look and how much powerful you are than me we kind of match now how do I not have a key didn't we both oh wait maybe we I can't use it maybe we bought the fake one
[331:48.72]there's there's two keys do I need one too no but there's two lucario keys one that you give to the guy for a quest and one that you use for yourself it's the not yeah it's the one that he gets okay and maybe uh maybe we can go where the dragon is and see if that oh that actually might be a much easier boss yeah we're jumping off uh be careful I've I die here I died here probably 30 times
[332:15.63]Okay, well, I'll watch you go first.
[332:16.83]Yeah, you're going to die, dude.
[332:18.05]Holy shit.
[332:18.61]That's where you do it.
[332:22.56]Nice.
[332:23.04]See?
[332:25.52]Trust me.
[332:27.08]I died so many times jumping off of that edge.
[332:30.28]Just being ridiculed and laughed at by everybody watching for days.
[332:35.43]I just had a flashback.
[332:37.67]I remember watching your initial Elden Ring playthrough in the area near here at the Castle Church where you have to find the three turtles.
[332:46.87]It was the closest I've ever come to just ending it all.
[332:51.47]Where's the dragon?
[332:54.63]But also, I agree, I fucking hate that place.
[333:01.52]Isn't the dragon right here?
[333:02.60]Uh... I don't know.
[333:06.32]I thought the dragon... I got distracted.
[333:07.96]Everything looks the same.
[333:08.86]I think it's up a bit further.
[333:12.02]Is it further up?
[333:19.82]Oh, spinning stone!
[333:22.48]Uh, there's a something boss enemy out here.
[333:25.82]Where are you?
[333:26.36]Oh shit, we lost each other.
[333:28.23]We're good.
[333:30.25]Yeah, I would avoid the super slug boss.
[333:34.31]What is that?
[333:34.87]Is that a... Oh, it's a tree spirit.
[333:38.69]Is that just a regular enemy or is that supposed to be the dragon?
[333:40.63]Because the key is behind the dragon.
[333:43.01]That's a regular enemy.
[333:43.87]What?
[333:44.57]The dragon's in like the alcove.
[333:51.89]Dude, he is moving his hips in all sorts of ways.
[333:56.90]He is just... He won't leave.
[334:03.38]He won't stop.
[334:04.10]His aggro range is insane.
[334:05.58]Do you want to kill him?
[334:08.12]Let's do it.
[334:08.88]Let's teach him a lesson.
[334:30.13]Let's find the dragon.
[334:31.37]We actually demolished him.
[334:35.55]Let me look at the map.
[334:36.33]Oh, I didn't get... Wait, I thought I picked up the map.
[334:39.29]Come on, snail.
[334:40.51]Shoot that ballista.
[334:42.62]That's so... I love that.
[334:45.64]I'm going to shoot this ballista and I'm going to get them.
[334:48.84]Oh, no, wait.
[334:49.34]I don't have any hands.
[334:50.22]How am I supposed to do this?
[334:52.20]Don't kill him.
[334:53.02]He's a character.
[334:53.56]I gave him a voice.
[334:55.07]That means he gets to live.
[334:56.57]You were the one hitting him.
[334:57.77]I didn't mean to.
[334:58.35]Let's go.
[335:06.39]I think we're on the wrong side.
[335:07.57]We're going to go like up here, like this way, right?
[335:17.42]Yeah, it's up here.
[335:25.94]We're going to softlock our game if you give one of the bosses a voice.
[335:29.08]Uh-oh.
[335:31.80]So don't do that.
[335:32.98]Isn't it right up here?
[335:41.42]Where is it?
[335:41.94]We need the map.
[335:44.01]I think it is in this direction.
[335:52.09]Get out of the way.
[335:53.45]Yeah, it's up here.
[335:58.02]Alright, what is it?
[336:02.70]I hope it's... I hope it's really easy.
[336:06.26]Oh, wait.
[336:06.96]I think I saw... Oh.
[336:09.44]It was a dragon.
[336:10.68]It's a dragon?
[336:11.50]What?
[336:13.94]But then it wasn't a dragon.
[336:15.68]But now it is a dragon.
[336:16.90]Wait, why is it... It's a dragon?
[336:19.14]It's a different dragon.
[336:20.36]Lame.
[336:23.63]Wait, it's not a... It's not a dragon.
[336:26.55]Whoa!
[336:28.36]Oh!
[336:28.92]Help!
[336:29.52]I'm dead!
[336:30.08]I'm dead!
[336:30.88]That was the fucking scariest thing I've ever seen in my life!
[336:33.34]That was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me.
[336:35.76]It was like a 3D movie, dude.
[336:37.24]It was coming out of the screen.
[336:38.58]My, like, chest hurts.
[336:39.98]It actually was a 3D movie.
[336:41.50]Oh my god!
[336:42.57]I guess it was a dragon.
[336:49.13]Holy shit!
[336:55.67]Are there two of them now?
[336:56.97]No, I think it's just the one.
[336:58.93]Oh, he hurt his ankle.
[337:19.40]Watch out.
[337:20.98]He's going to breathe the fire.
[337:31.09]This is not a Glenstone dragon.
[337:33.87]He has a fucking billion health.
[337:40.59]I think this is the starting area first dragon you would normally fight.
[337:46.45]Why wouldn't?
[337:49.90]Gonna despawn.
[337:54.86]Why you gotta be so negative?
[338:04.26]Why are you not on the horse?
[338:05.22]Are you trying to die?
[338:07.84]I don't like fighting on the horse.
[338:11.05]I get on the horse like when he moves.
[338:15.23]Trying to die?
[338:15.67]Hey, ready?
[338:29.64]Whack!
[338:45.11]He went way shorter than I thought.
[338:52.68]What the hell did I do that for?
[338:54.22]It's a good thing we didn't aggro him into that other boss enemy.
[339:00.68]No!
[339:03.51]He did.
[339:04.65]Does he get his health back?
[339:05.55]I don't think he does.
[339:06.85]Unless the co-op mod broke it.
[339:10.27]He does not.
[339:14.68]That can just happen.
[339:21.88]Oh my, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[339:25.02]Good luck.
[339:26.30]I've died to that enough times.
[339:34.95]Oh, I'm just gonna fly away again.
[339:50.46]Did you try to duck behind them?
[339:52.56]That was so funny.
[339:54.72]That should have worked, and if it did, you would have gotten a stamp of approval.
[340:00.90]That's so awesome.
[340:04.64]It was actually worth a try.
[340:06.68]You're right.
[340:07.16]Come on.
[340:16.64]Every cartoon I've ever watched means that should have worked.
[340:23.23]That's going to get me, isn't it?
[340:38.74]He needs to stop.
[340:47.73]Glenstone Dragon Agil, yeah.
[340:54.59]I'm going to get hit.
[340:57.34]He took one damage.
[340:59.34]I think it's because I was mid-jump.
[341:09.66]Oh, Aguil.
[341:10.34]Oh, Aguil.
[341:13.10]Aguil.
[341:15.36]Oh, my God.
[341:16.77]He just lacerated your throat.
[341:20.89]He was like...
[341:22.61]Yeah, I would have had the health if this game allowed for RP and I could have hid behind that stump.
[341:29.87]That's too bad that that didn't work.
[341:33.13]Aim for the head, genius.
[341:34.67]I'm not playing.
[341:36.10]We were spectating him playing.
[341:40.52]That wasn't me.
[341:42.76]Wait, are you talking about me?
[341:44.56]But I am a genius.
[341:45.50]Thank you.
[341:50.07]Okay, so...
[341:52.40]The key was behind him and I got more like golden seeds.
[341:54.74]There's a lot of good items behind him.
[341:56.72]Let's at least get the key.
[341:59.42]Don't hit his legs.
[342:03.59]Hey, I play my game the way you play yours.
[342:05.53]You know what I mean?
[342:07.11]I play my game the way I want.
[342:12.73]Oh, it is the first dragon.
[342:13.88]That's why it's doing the intro.
[342:24.77]Oh, a gear.
[342:26.59]Oh, a gear.
[342:58.34]I don't know if people know this but his head's actually up in the air and it's not on the ground at all times you can't always hit his head because it's raised above the ground a lot of the time well you don't know anything
[343:50.82]What did you just do to my fucking best friend?
[344:18.56]Trying to get him right in the face.
[344:19.56]That move sucks.
[344:26.86]That move sucks bad.
[344:35.54]Coward.
[344:39.06]Coward before me.
[344:40.39]Is that a World of Warcraft reference?
[344:51.81]Is that what Illidan says?
[344:54.15]That was not as deep as I wanted it to be.
[344:58.08]Let me try that one more time.
[345:00.76]Cower before me.
[345:02.74]Way better.
[345:04.00]A thousand times better than the first one.
[345:08.04]That was what you were supposed to hear, but instead you heard something else.
[345:13.14]Okay.
[345:13.58]What is it?
[345:14.32]What's the reference, old timer?
[345:15.76]I don't know.
[345:16.42]It was an orc.
[345:20.15]But it is World of Warcraft.
[345:21.67]Maybe.
[345:21.95]Okay.
[345:26.07]I don't... The first one was... The first one was Cookie Monster.
[345:46.02]What the hell was that move?
[345:48.60]Oh, God.
[345:55.38]Almost got it.
[345:55.96]Almost got it.
[345:56.40]Almost got it.
[345:58.96]What are you doing?
[346:01.20]There's something in my face.
[346:09.96]Don't breathe fire this way.
[346:11.00]Don't breathe.
[346:11.62]Don't breathe fire this way.
[346:13.16]It's the slam.
[346:21.96]Oh, that was a good hit.
[346:28.08]I knew he was, I was fucking greedy.
[346:30.11]I was like, I'm just going to hit him the one time and Jerma's also going to be dealing damage.
[346:35.27]There's no way he's going to get another attack off.
[346:46.07]Hey, I noticed, uh, you were kind of like looking at me and my buddy over here.
[346:50.17]I think you like fucking such hot shit.
[346:54.13]Thanks for help fighting the dragon.
[346:57.62]That did nothing he's watched That that's The dragon trainer That was his dragon And why wouldn't he be over here going like no, what have you done to my dragon?
[347:19.32]Because he's actually
[347:24.64]kind of relieved because his dad was a dragon trainer and he didn't really ever want the job but there's someone's got to take care of it how many of you guys here like hate my guts why what yeah I keep doing like these like stupid voices
[347:50.41]All right, where we going?
[347:51.95]I'm dead right now, so I need a rest.
[347:54.17]You're kind of in control of the whole the whole situation and you're just killing the mana.
[347:59.41]Do you need more mana?
[348:06.08]No, we're ready to do it.
[348:08.08]Dude, I can't vote.
[348:09.18]I'm fucking dead.
[348:12.90]So I have to run all the way back here.
[348:14.34]I guess it's so far.
[348:19.13]If we're saying there was the LB, there's no LB.
[348:21.39]Oh, you have to run all the way over there.
[348:24.15]Oh, come on, guys.
[348:28.06]It's not even a good impression of me.
[348:30.18]I would have laughed if it was good.
[348:32.74]It wasn't you.
[348:34.02]You think everything is about you.
[348:35.80]That way, that wasn't you doing what I was just doing.
[348:38.88]It was me doing what you were doing, but it wasn't me being you.
[348:41.57]Okay, let's go up to Lucario now that we have the actual key.
[348:44.75]I'm very confused of what you just said.
[348:52.35]Let's do it.
[349:05.27]What's this pole?
[349:19.22]I walked in the castle already.
[349:21.67]Why would you do that?
[349:22.75]Now I don't even have control of the character.
[349:24.41]I turn into an NPC.
[349:26.73]Yeah, I might have fucked things up.
[349:29.34]I didn't really think it through.
[349:30.32]You stop rushing.
[349:31.76]What the hell?
[349:32.68]How big is that hand back there?
[349:35.46]There's a hand that big in this game?
[349:38.73]You've never seen that?
[349:40.03]No.
[349:40.45]It's a secret boss.
[349:42.20]I actually do mean that.
[349:43.28]It actually is like a secret boss.
[349:44.94]Funny thing, a tidbit about this actual secret boss in the game, it drops nothing.
[349:50.64]There's no reason to kill it.
[349:52.10]It doesn't do anything.
[349:52.77]Where is it normally?
[349:55.61]Um, it's in, there's like some overpass where it's kind of hanging.
[350:00.73]It's like a useless enemy to kill.
[350:03.75]I forget where it is.
[350:05.30]It's like a narrow place, and it's like an overpass, and it drops down.
[350:08.70]It's in the mountains, yeah.
[350:11.58]I remember when I was finding it, it was like, holy shit, oh my god!
[350:15.24]And then killing it, it didn't, not even, like a butterfly, nothing.
[350:18.82]It has no loot table.
[350:23.79]Wow.
[350:24.27]Stand up!
[350:24.99]Fix your posture, for God's sakes.
[350:27.71]I'm tired.
[350:38.08]19% of you are hate watching me right now.
[350:45.36]Oh, shit.
[350:45.82]Say something that they'll hate.
[350:48.01]No, I don't want to do that.
[350:49.99]That's what they're here for.
[350:51.01]How could it be only 19%?
[350:52.09]That sounds pretty low.
[350:53.97]Oh, God.
[350:54.19]This guy has a lot of health.
[351:11.38]I got you.
[351:13.50]I got you.
[351:14.34]Oh, okay.
[351:15.34]What?
[351:16.76]I think you're underestimating how strong this guy is.
[351:18.94]He's pretty strong.
[351:20.36]I'm going to sneeze.
[351:21.40]I'm going to fight.
[351:22.98]He's pretty strong.
[351:25.08]He's pretty strong.
[351:31.29]He's pretty strong.
[351:34.53]What the fuck?
[351:35.09]I was trying to match it.
[351:35.83]That game lagged.
[351:41.14]Where are you?
[351:42.10]I died.
[351:42.60]I'm coming back.
[351:44.36]Oh, you didn't like spectate?
[351:46.34]No, I just did.
[351:55.86]Didn't give me the option to.
[351:56.94]Okay.
[351:58.74]Am I waiting for you?
[352:02.77]You have a debuff?
[352:03.97]Whatever.
[352:04.43]We'll be fine.
[352:05.15]He has like 700 damage.
[352:06.45]Glenstone.
[352:06.91]We're fine.
[352:11.08]It's like a bonfire up here.
[352:16.88]Seeing this place for the first time from the outside was awesome.
[352:18.80]This got me huge Bloodborne vibes.
[352:32.13]OK, I think I am.
[352:33.59]I am now the distinct like I use some weird shit.
[352:38.70]Okay, what's in here?
[352:39.52]Seems better now.
[352:42.75]This is a classic run through this room and pretend it doesn't exist.
[352:46.43]I don't even care what the enemies are.
[352:48.03]Okay.
[352:50.09]And let's rest.
[353:06.32]Oh.
[353:08.34]do you still have 18 000 viewers I don't know yeah I think I think I did leave like 17 000 souls at the dragon boss it gave it to me after I died so I thought I would respond with them because the weird co-op stuff I think I gotta go back yeah I got we gotta go I gotta go pick this yeah dude go pick this up yeah there were 18 000 souls in the ground that's you had that that's a lot
[353:34.35]Yeah, it's a lot.
[353:35.47]So I'm voting.
[353:37.49]I'm asking kindly, once again, if we can go to the temple quarter.
[353:47.66]Where is that?
[353:48.46]Just south of us.
[353:50.28]Oh, oh, oh, oh, I see what you mean.
[353:56.92]I didn't, I thought, for a second I thought you were talking about the dragon area.
[354:01.68]Oh yeah, the dragon area.
[354:03.87]I don't know why this is called, like, temple.
[354:05.36]There's no temple.
[354:20.79]Ah!
[354:25.91]You got what you needed?
[354:27.69]Yeah.
[354:29.69]Good.
[354:30.81]Then we go back to, uh...
[354:33.79]Church of the cuckoo.
[354:46.78]Are you insecure right now?
[354:48.12]No.
[354:49.10]I'm just chilling.
[354:52.38]I'm having fun.
[354:55.10]Don't worry about me.
[354:55.66]I'm good.
[354:56.88]What would you be insecure about?
[354:59.69]Cookie Monster voice that I did like 10 minutes ago.
[355:02.21]Oh.
[355:04.66]You did do a pretty weird marge like three hours ago as well.
[355:08.44]That was actually good though.
[355:09.64]That's the difference.
[355:11.48]I don't care if a voice sucks and it's stupid and it's like cringy that a human would do it in front of like a stadium full of people.
[355:18.82]That's fine as long as it was good.
[355:21.56]You cannot go back and tell me... Wait, wait, wait.
[355:24.08]What?
[355:25.08]Is it like, I don't know, by definition, if it was cringy, then it also wasn't good?
[355:29.34]No.
[355:30.56]It was an almost flawless Marge Simpson.
[355:34.20]But that was kind of cringy to do that, don't you think?
[355:36.47]No.
[355:38.85]Oh, all right.
[355:40.13]Then there's no argument here.
[355:42.41]I'm just going to let that guy... Oh, it's Mambo.
[355:46.01]Yeah, Mambo number five.
[355:46.99]Everybody loves Mambo.
[356:04.91]I thought that was a giant sheep I'm tanking it I'm tanking it I'm tanking it um will you one of us has fallen off this I'm tanking this I'm tanking this that was so sad
[356:23.87]I'm tanking it.
[356:24.35]I'm tanking it.
[356:24.91]I'm tanking it.
[356:25.35]I'm tanking it.
[356:28.61]Look out, Mambo.
[356:39.99]I hate... I don't want to kill Mambo, but we kind of have to.
[356:43.67]Why does every creature have a name?
[356:48.24]When you played through the first time, what did you use for a Spirit Summon?
[356:55.43]Mimic Tear.
[356:58.49]Yes, I ruined my first playthrough.
[357:00.35]That's... Oh.
[357:03.75]Look, it's not that... That's not a big deal.
[357:07.36]I didn't use the Spirit Summon all game until I found that, and then my chat was like... And I was like, what?
[357:12.48]I watched my Mimic Tear kill Morgoth without me even playing the game.
[357:17.04]And then I kind of felt like, oh, this is not...
[357:20.78]I remember, do you guys remember that?
[357:22.60]It was like, wow, more God.
[357:23.94]Oh my God, this is so epic.
[357:25.35]And he just killed him without even me playing.
[357:27.63]And it felt really, I was just like, oh, I didn't even really do anything.
[357:33.37]I can't remember.
[357:33.97]There was like one boss that I let my mimic tier fight on their own.
[357:37.51]And I was like, I don't even feel bad about that.
[357:39.51]I didn't feel like fighting this boss.
[357:41.76]Well, the reason why I say that is because the snake, that enemy we just fought, is... What is going on?
[357:47.80]What is this guy doing?
[357:49.22]It's super frozen, do you think?
[357:50.70]I'm getting what you were talking about before.
[357:57.92]I upgraded that snake with the fire whip to plus 10.
[358:01.16]That's what I used the whole game.
[358:04.40]His name was Mambo.
[358:07.38]I completely ignored the mechanic.
[358:11.15]Sure.
[358:14.86]That's a big bird.
[358:16.70]What would you say is... Did you hate Elden Beast like everybody else did?
[358:27.32]Kinda, yeah.
[358:27.92]I don't know if there's very many people that... Oh my god.
[358:32.04]Okay, hold on.
[358:32.56]This thing could kill us both.
[358:39.32]This thing has so much health.
[358:42.78]I think we just run.
[358:43.66]Yeah, we have to run, I think.
[358:54.98]Don't go over there.
[358:55.72]Use the... You can't move.
[358:58.10]Oh, my God.
[359:05.87]Help.
[359:07.29]I'm going across the bridge, man.
[359:08.79]I don't want to... I'm asking you.
[359:09.61]I'm asking God.
[359:13.33]I'm teleporting and shit.
[359:16.51]I'm telling you, just come across the bridge.
[359:17.63]We don't have to fucking kill this thing.
[359:19.88]Oh, okay.
[359:20.58]All right.
[359:20.88]All right.
[359:34.16]I'm fine.
[359:35.64]This is so stressful.
[359:42.70]Why is this guy disappearing with magic?
[359:44.74]Did you... What?
[359:46.56]I didn't see.
[359:48.04]Where did this come from?
[359:49.02]Help!
[359:50.00]Help!
[359:56.61]No!
[359:56.91]I'm alive!
[359:58.23]I can't!
[360:11.24]Are you still alive?
[360:13.90]Yeah.
[360:14.74]How did you live through that?
[360:15.92]I don't understand.
[360:17.14]I stood back and watched.
[360:18.24]Nothing aggroed to me.
[360:24.22]Uh, but what are you doing?
[360:27.45]Should I rest?
[360:27.93]Wait, where's the bonfire?
[360:32.72]Oh.
[360:33.54]Do you want me to reset it?
[360:37.09]uh sure I think we need to do like a legit reset because it's desyncing a lot I don't close the game yet because my I have 20 000 souls that are on the ground out there oh okay all right all right this guy this guy is crazy man well just ignore him just ignore him okay all right
[361:12.07]oh it's the teleporting glintstone guys is that what you meant he actually teleports oh gosh do I oh am I gonna get those here you you can go around the side my game crashed oh thank god it's back there's still dude there's still an angry dude down here
[361:39.65]Okay, I am now ready to sever the connection.
[361:44.59]Let's get the next bonfire.
[361:49.35]Okay, I'm going to follow your lead.
[361:50.77]Okay.
[361:56.19]Yeah, we're desyncing so hard.
[361:58.84]Watch it.
[361:59.58]We're going to just jump and run.
[362:19.31]Oh, my God.
[362:24.56]Don't drop those souls.
[362:26.02]I'm not.
[362:26.58]I'm holding them.
[362:32.90]Excuse me?
[362:35.92]What's happening?
[362:36.81]Okay.
[362:38.89]Stir, I need you to communicate with me clearly.
[362:41.21]Should I go up there with you?
[362:43.61]Yeah.
[362:43.81]That's where my next spawn fire is.
[362:49.14]Don't follow me.
[363:05.44]Did you forget everything?
[363:06.46]No, I remember, but he's just moving so fast.
[363:08.76]He's moving too quickly.
[363:11.66]Oh, sorry, I'll slow down.
[363:12.84]I'll wear some heavy armor.
[363:15.23]All right.
[363:15.43]So do you want to actually do like a reset?
[363:19.23]Yeah.
[363:22.21]I'm going to do like a quit to main menu and we'll restart.
[363:24.55]I don't think we need to restart the whole game.
[363:26.50]No, I don't think so.
[363:27.08]I think I have to banish you.
[363:33.56]Yeah.
[363:34.12]Just leave us the fuck alone.
[363:36.24]What is doing that?
[363:39.08]And then I banished you.
[363:41.88]I hope you spent your souls.
[363:43.70]I did, but am I going to get those back?
[363:47.72]It's 8,600.
[363:51.04]They're going to be right here, right?
[363:54.22]Yeah, sure.
[363:55.26]Yeah, okay, we're good.
[364:07.43]You look like you're in a painting.
[364:08.49]Cool.
[364:26.67]Okay.
[364:27.99]I am ready whenever you are.
[364:30.95]In fact, I'm just going to get out of the way because this thing's going to keep doing that, isn't it?
[364:33.92]Yeah.
[364:34.62]I put my thing down.
[364:35.62]I'm going to try and kill it in the real world, which is my world.
[364:38.42]Do something funny.
[364:46.18]I'm falling asleep.
[364:49.05]Did you just not see the insanity of the last five minutes?
[364:53.18]Maybe if you're falling asleep, you should go to sleep and actually get a good night rest.
[364:58.67]I feel like we screamed at least five or six times each.
[365:07.67]Why are you asleep?
[365:20.84]I'm really used to the screaming by now, so it's not that big of a deal.
[365:24.88]Don't do that, though.
[365:27.00]Oh, that was the wake-up call.
[365:29.04]Get in here.
[365:29.34]There's a chest back here.
[365:30.78]You're running away.
[365:31.32]Wrong way.
[365:32.50]You're kind of just freaking out, dude.
[365:34.17]I'm fine.
[365:35.99]Don't you want the sick loot?
[365:40.07]Sure.
[365:41.23]I got immutable shield.
[365:44.15]A little bit of witchcraft.
[365:45.39]The first stone sword key I found the whole game.
[365:47.83]Pretty cool.
[365:49.66]You get the chest?
[365:53.57]It's just right there.
[365:54.39]Yeah.
[365:55.37]Golden rune.
[365:56.85]Pretty cool.
[366:16.52]Have a pizza party.
[366:30.15]Have a pizza.
[366:33.19]I could go for a pizza.
[366:36.57]Sombra ancient dragon smithing stone.
[366:39.68]We actually just do that.
[366:42.44]There's a lot of hidden walls here.
[366:48.08]Well, now the game really begins because I just got horror loser remembrance.
[366:54.13]This is like 100,000 souls.
[366:57.69]Nice find.
[366:58.43]That's a good find.
[366:59.25]That's a pretty good find.
[367:04.36]That's also a good find, but it's faith, isn't it?
[367:07.46]Stupid bubble thing.
[367:10.22]But that's just not good.
[367:16.45]Get the axe.
[367:18.39]Get the axe.
[367:19.23]Get the axe.
[367:19.85]Don't do the remembrance.
[367:27.29]Is the axe good?
[367:28.19]I don't remember.
[367:29.57]I feel like the weapon art was kind of lame on it.
[367:31.23]Maybe it scales really well.
[367:40.93]Alright, it's this one here, right?
[367:44.26]It's the one that has no books, right?
[367:50.97]I don't know.
[367:51.35]I think this is another one of those things that maybe only they ever did one time.
[367:54.14]Yeah, it's over here.
[367:55.94]This place is wacky.
[367:58.88]It's like three or four ways to go in secret walls.
[368:04.30]Ooh, I think that's alright.
[368:10.05]Then come over here.
[368:13.19]The items you get from the boss souls are also randomized.
[368:15.75]Oh, that's alright.
[368:16.41]Well, I'm just going to break it then.
[368:17.37]Just put strength.
[368:18.39]True.
[368:26.53]Okay, cool.
[368:27.27]And by the way, interesting to note, nothing up here, but jump over here.
[368:33.43]Take a look at that.
[368:37.82]Mm-hmm.
[368:38.80]And I think there's another thing we can do here.
[368:41.50]Any secrets in here?
[368:43.08]No, down another one.
[368:44.60]Any secrets in here?
[368:45.88]Yes.
[368:50.12]Whoa.
[368:51.74]Oh, we were actually fighting something.
[368:53.42]Mm-hmm.
[368:57.22]This is the big thing here.
[368:58.76]And I think this is one of the best scaling staffs in the game, right?
[369:02.96]There's one of those witches in here.
[369:04.17]This thing actually is going to... This thing hurts a lot from what I remember.
[369:15.04]Let's go.
[369:15.30]1, 8, 3.
[369:19.09]Yeah, I've never come down here.
[369:20.55]Really?
[369:21.71]I think I remember trying to find this one, so I don't think I did the whole floor thing that you just did.
[369:27.97]I think I found the first secret door.
[369:29.63]That's also really good.
[369:31.28]The magma sword.
[369:31.94]It's faith.
[369:36.40]Sure, maybe I should do faith.
[369:38.56]This thing is the sword.
[369:40.06]Yeah.
[369:41.58]That thing is really good.
[369:45.62]I get to be the magma worm.
[369:53.04]I have a lot of souls to lose, so let's beat her first try.
[369:58.70]This is going to be a really easy boss.
[370:05.11]How is this going to work with the bubble stuff?
[370:11.79]What?
[370:13.60]That's not him.
[370:15.08]This is an imposter.
[370:18.08]Why is he wearing this default...
[370:22.25]He's just... He's just a guy.
[370:24.79]He's in like a Ray of Lucaria with like the stone helmet thing.
[370:29.59]He's just a normal guy.
[370:37.96]Oh, no.
[370:38.32]This is where... This is not... This is the dog.
[370:45.85]Usually, yeah.
[370:53.75]Be careful, my friend.
[371:10.30]And nothing left in that flask.
[371:22.37]Okay, we got him.
[371:27.78]Gideon Ofnir of Radagon.
[371:33.24]He couldn't pick a character either.
[371:34.54]I don't know what everything I guess I'll be Sir Gideon Ofnir of Radagon, the brave, the wise.
[371:43.25]Cool.
[371:53.31]Actually,
[372:02.11]Yes.
[372:04.77]Do I go full on just absolute insane mode here?
[372:09.22]What is absolute insane mode?
[372:11.30]Could you break that down for people who are unfamiliar?
[372:13.66]It is me doing the horror lude remembrance and getting like 120,000 souls.
[372:17.12]You should go super hard here.
[372:21.70]No mercy.
[372:23.66]That's it?
[372:24.90]Wait.
[372:26.24]I thought it was way more than that.
[372:30.06]Isn't that one of the last bosses in the whole game?
[372:33.84]yeah I thought it was like 100k how much how much did you get 30k that might be scaled then is it scaled okay well because yeah it should be like 80. it's 80k for eldon 30k though all right whatever
[372:58.19]What a useless amount of knowledge that I've held in the back of my brain for like a year to be like, yeah, I think Horiluz is 80,000 and apparently be right.
[373:08.56]Can I use this?
[373:10.54]This thing is crazy.
[373:19.46]Oh, you got the fucking sexy girl hat.
[373:21.82]Yep.
[373:22.22]Sorry.
[373:22.81]I have it.
[373:24.79]Hmm.
[373:27.70]She's not even real.
[373:28.78]It's starting to look more and more like the character I actually played the game with.
[373:37.01]Oh, is the ball still here?
[373:37.79]I wonder if the ball is something else.
[373:48.62]It's an interesting group.
[373:53.42]Ooh.
[374:24.17]now I'm now I'm stand back I've got the new fall season um well you is this wait this is a sheep here yeah usually I think there's like bunny rabbits but the the normal enemies are replaced
[374:51.98]You know, I'm saying, you know, you know, like, I'm not going to finish the sentence.
[374:55.54]I know exactly what you mean.
[375:01.54]Troll Knight sword.
[375:02.68]Oh, I like that weapon.
[375:06.37]I probably don't have the strength to use it.
[375:08.95]Probably not.
[375:13.83]So do you want to go walk around and get all the wacky shit here or do you want to just kill Ray Lucario and get out of here?
[375:20.76]um this area is so big I just want to kill uh lucario I do want to check back here real quick like just a sprint there's usually a bunch of items mosquito is biting me oh I got the sacramental bud
[375:49.08]I got regular club.
[375:53.24]Anything else back here?
[375:55.12]There's one item around the back.
[375:57.58]We got a tree over here.
[376:01.73]Stop!
[376:05.69]A little bit of a ritual pot.
[376:23.29]Oh, I thought there could only be one barfo.
[376:25.84]What happened to that?
[376:27.28]I just wanted to see what it looked like.
[376:29.08]Okay.
[376:40.32]I'm putting on this thing again.
[376:41.68]Yeah.
[376:46.92]Okay, I'm just going.
[376:48.40]You're a broad.
[376:48.76]Me?
[376:52.92]No.
[376:54.54]It's going to come out of nowhere and call me a fraud.
[376:57.02]You're a fraud.
[376:58.14]You know that?
[376:58.64]Well, I've got an epic loot here.
[377:01.76]I've got to get that one.
[377:09.43]Thank God I wasn't... Okay.
[377:12.07]The ball is still here.
[377:13.31]What do Starlight Shards even do?
[377:18.46]I forget which way it goes at the end.
[377:20.86]Same.
[377:21.26]Mm-hmm.
[377:22.85]I've never gone down that way.
[377:24.23]I died.
[377:33.26]Why can I see everything?
[377:36.20]Oh, because you reset it.
[377:37.18]You want me to wait for you?
[377:48.65]Yeah.
[377:50.35]Be careful.
[378:08.32]I have to go down to the bottom.
[378:09.92]There's an item, dude.
[378:11.61]It's a purple.
[378:17.65]I thought that was going to kill you.
[378:19.71]Me too.
[378:21.43]Ooh, look at that.
[378:22.69]The guy with the hat.
[378:34.14]Where does this teleporter take you?
[378:35.28]I forget.
[378:37.35]um I also forget what do you mean you forgot this is it's not like this is like a 200 hour game with thousands of locations and and potentially millions of different things to see um it might take you inside volcano near the volcano manor I think so
[379:02.65]I think that one takes you somewhere stupid, but there is one in those locked rooms that takes you to... We literally actually have a comedy guy.
[379:10.74]He doesn't have a weapon.
[379:13.56]He just has the shield.
[379:15.70]The weapon is a shield weapon.
[379:17.76]No, wait.
[379:18.56]He's got pyromancy?
[379:21.98]He's killing me with comedy.
[379:23.50]Okay.
[379:32.55]Oh, that hurt a lot.
[379:40.44]Where did this person come from?
[379:41.64]I don't know.
[379:45.18]Why don't you ask them?
[379:46.44]I got Moonvale.
[379:48.30]I used that for a while.
[379:50.35]I've actually never used it.
[379:52.32]I would be curious to try it.
[379:53.86]It's really fun.
[379:54.48]Because I'm intelligent and things.
[379:57.84]Let's just make sure we don't get jumped on here.
[380:00.24]This is one of those awful enemies, isn't it?
[380:03.27]No.
[380:03.65]It was one of the sad, pathetic losers.
[380:14.32]uh everybody is gonna hate you for using it because it's like it was like the broken meta weapon but it's actually very fun to use the weapon arts are awesome I really like do like the crescent moon slash thingy yeah I'm not gonna use it unless I can upgrade it but I'll keep it in mind I mean hasn't this game have like a whole bunch of balance passes is it still like oh you gotta get moon veil I think they nerfed it but it doesn't matter
[380:45.34]I'm really low on healing for this.
[380:48.48]Is this a good idea?
[380:49.32]Should we?
[380:50.42]I mean, we don't know what boss it even is.
[380:52.94]I keep like we get here and it's like, oh, yeah, you got to get ready for the I don't.
[380:57.00]Oh, this is where the game we're not going to be able to beat this.
[381:00.66]Do you see what's up there?
[381:02.06]No, I didn't.
[381:02.68]You didn't see what was up there?
[381:03.82]I didn't see.
[381:04.62]I didn't see.
[381:06.30]This is actually impossible.
[381:09.30]Good luck.
[381:09.96]What the fuck?
[381:11.68]This room is so small.
[381:16.70]Doesn't he do a full... Yeah, he fills the whole room, dude.
[381:23.52]This is not going to be possible.
[381:27.32]This is not completable.
[381:35.95]All right, we're going to have to figure out... We're just going to need to scale so much we can kill him, like GPS him.
[381:43.51]Yep.
[381:47.21]We actually might be okay as long as it doesn't do that more than like four or five times.
[381:51.19]I have no healing, so next one I'm dead.
[382:02.18]Oh boy.
[382:08.44]How did you not die?
[382:09.38]I don't know.
[382:19.77]There's a lot of the optional shit like this where you had to do a lot, like go through some weird amount of effort to fight this boss.
[382:25.55]Yeah.
[382:26.19]Also another one I never fought him.
[382:29.27]I feel like you missed a pretty large amount of the optional stuff in the game.
[382:35.99]See, the game's just that fucking big though.
[382:38.01]I really didn't.
[382:38.99]I keep saying, oh yeah, I've never seen this.
[382:42.01]But like, I don't know.
[382:47.48]Uh-oh.
[382:49.94]What?
[382:52.10]You lagged on my screen.
[382:54.10]He, like, jumped backwards and his hand sliding me backwards hurt me.
[382:59.28]Interesting thought from somebody in chat, though, is this is phase one.
[383:04.63]We have to fight a different boss after this, I think.
[383:10.13]I'm pretty sure that's accurate.
[383:10.87]Maybe I'm not sure how.
[383:14.05]There was an option in the randomizer for multi-phase bosses to switch creatures between phases.
[383:23.39]Hey, I'm for it.
[383:25.15]Do you want to go again?
[383:25.85]It wasn't that bad.
[383:26.99]No, it wasn't that bad, but I... I need to do more damage.
[383:30.54]Can you block that big explosion?
[383:32.54]Because we can't avoid it, but maybe if you get a lightning resist shield.
[383:41.40]I have...
[383:44.29]uh I have the crucible shield but it's gonna be so heavy I don't think this will this even work I can drop a shield for you with 34 lightning is like this thing says more okay then I've I've just got a little baby light shields yeah we can try that he didn't have a lot of health and he doesn't that boss normally like
[384:08.34]teleport around in the sky we might get in trouble there we'll see uh the one issue is I feel like I'm not doing very much damage with this I need to upgrade it but whatever fuck it let's go we could uh quickly before we do the boss go to eg and unlock that blacksmith like we've been talking about because we can just ride the horse straight up there now let's try it one or two more times
[384:37.96]This is one of the fun walkbacks.
[384:40.94]Yes, it is.
[384:42.24]One of the most... One of the most walkbacks of all Dark Souls.
[384:49.08]And we should probably get rid of the... The bowl?
[384:53.60]I called it a bowl and I'm mad.
[384:56.75]We should probably get rid of the bowl.
[384:59.21]Oh, the bowl.
[385:00.57]Oh, you're teleporting around?
[385:04.13]What?
[385:04.43]Okay, that was not fucking fair.
[385:07.28]That was not fair.
[385:14.92]That was not fair.
[385:21.99]I'm gonna die to random enemies.
[385:24.77]I just reset them.
[385:33.74]Yeah, forget where you even go to destroy the bull.
[385:36.86]You gotta go up.
[385:38.44]Is that outside this ladder?
[385:39.52]I think it's actually out where that border is.
[385:47.74]I also think there's a shortcut on this side, so you don't have to go that way, but it's still pretty long.
[385:59.75]There go 9000 souls.
[386:00.13]Wonderful.
[386:09.07]What are you fighting out here?
[386:11.43]Little baby.
[386:14.39]Yeah, I've used like half of my flasks already.
[386:17.42]Well, we got to do it then.
[386:18.26]We have to beat it.
[386:18.70]I'm down to three.
[386:21.20]Okay, good luck.
[386:35.39]More like Placid who sucks.
[386:54.86]Oh my goodness!
[386:56.28]Is he gonna do it?
[387:17.95]I'm so paranoid.
[387:29.39]Okay, actually was not that bad if you tank it with the shield.
[387:37.97]Yeah, that was pretty good.
[387:48.10]What's wrong with him?
[387:49.72]He's staggered.
[387:50.56]I'm stabbing his face.
[387:54.13]face stabbed.
[387:55.13]What is he going to teleport?
[388:05.85]Yeah.
[388:06.75]Is this where he does the flying thing?
[388:13.99]Oh, my God.
[388:16.87]He's in the walls, dude.
[388:18.37]This is going to be impossible.
[388:21.65]He goes in the walls.
[388:34.78]You're still, yeah, your damage is really bad.
[388:37.26]It's terrible.
[388:41.46]How upgraded is that weapon?
[388:42.84]Plus one, man.
[388:44.22]This thing's a piece of fucking shit.
[388:46.22]This thing's a piece of shit.
[388:49.08]Upgrade a weapon.
[388:51.18]I am plus 16.
[388:52.20]What?! !
[388:56.97]hold on saying what oh you're plus 16. yes how did you do that how did you not hear me saying this two hours ago I said it like four or five times you're a plus 16 on your I'm plus one I'm plus why don't you have that many things wait a minute upgrade it only costs one per upgrade
[389:27.44]We're right back.
[389:29.92]That's why I wanted to go to the blacksmith.
[389:31.32]Don't go to the round table.
[389:32.96]We teleport to temple quarter again.
[389:44.23]And then we just got to go north for a while.
[389:47.39]That was shocking.
[389:49.43]I'm shocked that you're at plus 16.
[389:51.61]I don't know why it's shocking.
[389:53.93]I am shocked.
[389:55.23]I'm shocked to learn how little you listen to me.
[390:07.61]He said it like 50 times.
[390:09.49]I thought you were talking about your Glintstone thing was like super powerful somehow because of a... For some reason.
[390:16.88]You even asked me why it was so strong and I said it's because my weapon is plus 16 and it's a weapon art.
[390:24.73]Oh, I... You only said that once and I didn't listen to you.
[390:28.19]You asked.
[390:30.53]Who asked?
[390:32.51]Hey, hey.
[390:33.13]Who asked?
[390:34.13]Am I right, guys?
[390:34.75]Um...
[390:36.35]I asked.
[390:37.45]I care.
[390:37.91]A plus one weapon.
[390:40.43]I may as well be no controller plugged in.
[390:47.68]That's so fucking stupid.
[390:49.46]I cannot believe that.
[390:51.12]I forgot how this works.
[390:51.98]Do we go underneath the thing?
[390:53.62]Like we just keep going under here or do we have to go up to the left for EG?
[390:59.20]The thing is, I was like so indecisive that I wouldn't.
[391:01.32]Oh, I don't want to upgrade that because I don't know.
[391:02.98]I'm not sure.
[391:16.77]up and to the left up and to the left a little bit of a bonfire here for any bonfire enjoyers coming up on our
[391:24.56]left hand side if you look out the passenger side window well but to be really fair though you did go from like doing nothing to like millions of damage like 30 minutes ago 40 minutes ago yeah because I got very excited and I told you I went from plus 5 to 16. so it's not like this has been going on for the last six and a half hours this is just you know like 30 40 minutes ago you got omega juiced up you got absolutely juiced up this happened like shortly after market before we did the castle
[391:59.91]Did it?
[392:01.07]Yeah, because after we beat Margit, there was a whole bunch of smithing stones on the floor for me in the front of the castle.
[392:05.87]You got absolutely powered up.
[392:08.15]Really?
[392:08.49]Yeah.
[392:10.31]Well, it's not that long.
[392:12.17]I bet you thought it would take longer for me to surpass you, kid.
[392:15.49]Just wait till I get this thing to plus 16.
[392:17.50]All of a sudden, you're going to be freaking out.
[392:19.04]Okay, where are we going?
[392:20.84]Because this bear hurts.
[392:22.88]Keep running north.
[392:24.98]Have you played?
[392:27.05]You didn't know where we were going until chat told you five seconds ago.
[392:31.25]I knew.
[392:31.69]I figured it out.
[392:33.37]What?
[392:33.55]There's a chest over there.
[392:35.29]Hey, remember when you wanted to see that?
[392:42.22]Every enemy.
[392:43.48]Every random ass enemy.
[392:45.72]When Elden Ring was new after my first playthrough and there were some mods, I used one that was... I don't know what's hitting me.
[392:52.93]There was one where the enemy aggro range was basically infinite.
[392:57.79]So like you'd spawn into a zone and every single enemy that has loaded in would run at you.
[393:04.48]Good times.
[393:05.74]It's pretty good times.
[393:10.68]So where exactly are we going from where you are right now?
[393:17.36]Um.
[393:19.16]Like from where you are currently right now.
[393:20.78]I believe you just hold left and then you go through some ruins and then Eiji's on the left.
[393:25.27]Okay.
[393:26.33]I feel like I already went kind of far though.
[393:29.09]You have gone kind of far.
[393:30.13]I don't think I've passed it though.
[393:33.54]No, I don't think you've been going that far.
[393:38.62]I definitely don't think you've passed it.
[393:40.44]Yeah, no, it's right up here.
[393:41.83]Yeah.
[393:48.89]Oh, you made it.
[393:51.16]What are you doing?
[393:56.00]You were running in place like 100 feet in the air on my screen that whole time.
[394:01.50]I have no idea where you are.
[394:05.14]I'm just following the marker now.
[394:06.97]Because the marker was pointing me to you in the air.
[394:14.36]Hey, there you are.
[394:15.60]You know, they took that sound from Vega from Street Fighter.
[394:18.61]He makes that sound.
[394:20.25]They did it first.
[394:22.57]I think something's wrong with my game.
[394:24.99]Okay.
[394:25.31]Well, let's just get to this thing.
[394:27.59]It's right up here, friend.
[394:34.29]Can you hear the sound of my voice, friend?
[394:35.75]Can you just tell me north, east, south, or west from where we are?
[394:39.67]Just continue going north.
[394:42.00]Okay.
[394:44.04]This game sucks.
[394:44.82]This game sucks.
[394:45.52]This game sucks.
[394:46.24]This game sucks.
[394:48.19]Well, how did you die?
[394:48.95]This game sucks.
[394:51.07]What did he do?
[394:52.67]My horsey didn't jump.
[394:53.67]It got stuck on a rock for a second, and then it didn't jump.
[395:03.36]I can't believe that GRR Martin would fucking do that.
[395:09.72]Really, man?
[395:10.26]Okay.
[395:11.76]Hi.
[395:12.23]There you are.
[395:12.63]I can finally see you now.
[395:17.12]Oh, I know where to go now.
[395:18.28]Okay.
[395:19.16]I remember now.
[395:20.08]You feel like it's an illusory wall.
[395:21.70]You have to hit this.
[395:22.38]Yeah.
[395:23.80]Yeah.
[395:24.18]If you're lame, you hit the wall.
[395:28.19]I got my ten souls.
[395:29.79]Yeah.
[395:30.01]Cool kids do it the other way.
[395:39.31]Okay.
[395:40.75]So I need to make a decision here.
[395:42.76]The decision is I'm going to upgrade a bunch of shit.
[395:50.38]He's not here.
[395:52.68]He's loading in.
[395:58.85]Okay.
[396:06.07]Hi.
[396:10.51]What do I want?
[396:12.13]Hey, by the way, just a quick question.
[396:15.34]Yeah?
[396:16.34]On my game, it is not one smithing stone to upgrade something.
[396:23.34]I need four to keep going.
[396:28.30]I think you have the cool cheat game.
[396:30.96]I don't.
[396:32.24]Oh, it's part of the randomizer.
[396:35.14]And my thought, because I gave you the overall seed and you copied all my stuff, that you would also have that.
[396:39.60]But I think that makes sense because you actually don't have my seed.
[396:44.79]So something happened.
[396:46.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[396:47.21]Somber?
[396:49.71]I think it's somber, not regular.
[396:53.29]I think somber is always one.
[396:56.29]Like, in the normal game.
[396:59.30]Somber can't be plus 16.
[397:00.74]So everyone was making fun of me, and it turns out that I... Yeah, somber weapons go up to plus 10.
[397:07.70]Yeah, so when I was doing the upgrades, it was like, oh, I need four more stones.
[397:10.94]I'm sitting here going, what is people talking about?
[397:12.72]I had it right.
[397:13.58]I'm not the idiot.
[397:14.70]I'm looking at what I got on my screen.
[397:18.65]It wasn't my fault.
[397:23.23]uh so give me all your stones then wait you can't so I need a somber weapon because we'll get give me your weapon and I can upgrade it oh that's right we can do that uh here do this one I want to use this for a little while I don't have a somber one so if you have a plus one hold on I I can take yours all the way to plus seven okay hold on I can do
[397:52.74]I can take this to plus three.
[397:55.68]Four.
[397:56.80]Okay.
[397:57.88]I need... You can do it from five to seven, right?
[398:01.30]Yeah.
[398:01.42]Okay.
[398:01.98]Wait, I have to... There.
[398:18.47]No, please not the joke weapon.
[398:19.75]Well, take...
[398:23.30]no it's fine it's fine I'm gonna I'll upgrade this one too we're doing the finger it you're gonna do the finger but yeah okay I'm gonna do them both okay he's gonna do the finger I'm gonna do them both
[398:48.46]Is everybody really going to be mad at me about this?
[398:50.64]I've been doing like 60 damage for the last two hours.
[398:53.94]It's going to be better.
[398:55.40]I deleted it.
[398:57.80]By accident.
[399:01.44]Hold on.
[399:02.61]I need that back, actually.
[399:04.17]So you need to figure that out.
[399:11.07]I don't have the souls to upgrade.
[399:12.79]If you have like runes you can drop, it's like a thousand per upgrade.
[399:17.30]just give it back bro just give it back bro come on bro yeah but this is not like diablo 2 I can't drop rune I can't drop gold on the ground you can drop runes what right you can just discard like a stack of runes where wait can you actually do that though
[399:40.81]Pretty sure.
[399:41.31]Yes, you can.
[399:41.92]How?
[399:43.22]This is like Diablo.
[399:44.56]You just discard the runes just like you do with the weapon.
[399:47.06]But you have to do it with your inventory, not your equipment.
[399:51.70]Oh, not discard.
[399:53.16]Leave.
[399:53.94]Do not discard them.
[399:57.19]I need 1,200 rune to get seven.
[400:03.91]Where is this?
[400:05.95]Where is it in the item menu?
[400:08.33]I don't know.
[400:08.69]The item menu is like gigantic.
[400:14.45]It's golden runes.
[400:23.76]Oh, okay.
[400:24.64]I don't think this is going to get you there.
[400:29.12]I didn't think you could drop those.
[400:30.20]No, I didn't think you could drop those.
[400:32.10]I thought those were like bound.
[400:33.74]That was 400.
[400:39.68]I don't think I had enough.
[400:41.31]If we could sell stuff here, I could do it, but I don't think he sells.
[400:44.47]Oh, no.
[400:45.71]Yeah, I can't.
[400:47.67]I can't plus seven then.
[400:48.63]Look, I'm going to be doing like 500% more damage than I was before.
[400:52.07]It's fine.
[400:52.55]We're good.
[400:52.93]Just give it to me.
[401:11.28]There you go.
[401:13.98]Yeah, plus six is pretty big for somber.
[401:15.86]It's on the ground.
[401:19.40]It's not.
[401:23.13]Did you delete it?
[401:24.47]No, it's on the ground.
[401:27.17]I put it right here.
[401:29.83]I can still pick it up again.
[401:31.79]okay hold on let me sit down you can't pick it up because you upgraded it what what do you mean now what hold on it's too high what does that mean he's not plus what does this mean I got a plus one omen killer still this is fucked oh okay you can't drop that for me we were trying to tell you we were warning you you've never had a plus six so you can't
[401:59.30]I'm just trying to play this game with my friend.
[402:01.44]Fucking Miyazaki.
[402:04.62]When can I hold this?
[402:07.36]Can I?
[402:08.10]I can't.
[402:11.38]Do you see the item I dropped on the ground?
[402:13.22]I can see that.
[402:13.84]Yes.
[402:15.18]Okay.
[402:16.06]That's a plus two.
[402:16.86]Okay.
[402:20.46]I need intelligence first.
[402:21.66]How much do I need?
[402:22.86]That's a plus three.
[402:26.50]That's a plus four.
[402:27.68]Yep.
[402:29.99]People were telling us we couldn't drop that shit.
[402:32.14]Wait, I thought we couldn't.
[402:33.32]Why is everybody making things up to us?
[402:35.52]The only reason we did it that way.
[402:36.98]Wait, what?
[402:40.98]okay all right all right and um here's a uh here's a maybe you can't see that one maybe that one's too high that one's a plus seven I got that six but what do I I need to upgrade something else that I can actually use I need 16 intelligence so what is somber in my fucking inventory that I can equip
[403:08.72]Dude, we're just we're destroying the economy.
[403:12.24]Wait, OK.
[403:16.88]The finger, he has the finger and I can't get it back from him.
[403:20.83]Alright, I'm just going to do like the gargoyle axe or something or the omen cleaver.
[403:26.85]Gargoyle axe is good.
[403:27.85]Well, either of those, but it's regular smithing stones.
[403:31.18]Gargoyle.
[403:34.32]Yeah.
[403:37.98]Can I hold this?
[403:40.53]Hold what?
[403:43.87]The gargoyle.
[403:47.85]Okay.
[403:48.31]But this is not... This is regular smithing stone, though.
[403:52.09]I need four.
[403:52.73]What do you mean, please?
[404:03.65]The sword will work.
[404:06.13]I'm not sure that... I don't think it will.
[404:10.70]upgrade the runes great sword yeah I know but I need to intelligent I can't this whole thing got up because you took the finger from me and I can't get it back what they're saying is is that if you upgrade that sword then I can drop the finger and you'll be able to see it because you have a item that's upgraded to six okay all right so upgrade this stupid sword plus one I need ruins or or I have a bloodhound's fang
[404:39.43]or Rivers of Blood that I can give you, or you can do it to the Moon Veil.
[404:43.21]Because I might actually upgrade that anyway.
[404:45.19]Alright, but I need like 15,000 souls.
[404:49.98]Okay, that should be enough.
[404:53.12]I need like 15,000 souls to upgrade this to plus 7.
[404:57.34]Oh.
[404:57.86]It's way too much.
[405:00.34]And what would you like to go do?
[405:01.54]I'm freaking out, dude.
[405:03.60]Dude, I... I don't know!
[405:05.96]I don't have a weapon anymore!
[405:08.03]I think you only need like six thousand we could just go sell some I don't know I'm selling literally everything I have I thought I thought I just almost killed him we just run up into that castle and kill the lights uh all right go that boss go fight this come on yeah keep playing and save up
[405:35.04]Everything, we're fine.
[405:36.62]Blame, blame the, the fact that we didn't know that.
[405:41.22]How are we, how are we supposed to know that was going to happen?
[405:48.06]Because of the strict online integrity of the Elden Ring game where you definitely can't just download a soul level 200 character and then play online.
[405:59.93]We can't drop shit.
[406:03.11]It's true.
[406:05.53]We don't know.
[406:06.15]We could probably kill this boss.
[406:11.55]I think we can easily demolish this boss and make it look like children were supposed to play this game.
[406:19.46]I actually don't do terrible damage with this.
[406:26.90]This area is also... It might be lower level.
[406:32.48]I can't remember.
[406:33.77]Jesus.
[406:36.19]Ooh, Carrion Regalceptor.
[406:38.27]Oh, I thought that was a sword.
[406:40.83]Also a captain's staff.
[406:41.91]Is this guy, like, extra big?
[406:43.53]I feel like they're not normally this big.
[406:46.43]Oh, you didn't find the secret extra egg boss?
[406:48.98]Egg bubble boss?
[406:49.84]You didn't find the bubble butt boss?
[406:51.92]Oh, looks like you don't know that his bubble butt can fucking crush your fucking jaw.
[406:56.86]Dude, I'm so fucked up right now.
[406:58.84]I'm just like, oh, there's so many emotions.
[407:00.72]There's too much stimulation.
[407:01.94]There's way too much stimulation right now.
[407:17.78]OK.
[407:20.56]First of all, get this off.
[407:27.20]OK, so.
[407:35.89]Lance.
[407:39.99]Ah.
[407:48.30]all right what do you think this oh my god nice damage dude maybe upgrade your weapon
[408:17.80]Oh my goodness.
[408:22.04]Oh, that was actually pretty cool.
[408:23.24]I didn't know that.
[408:25.09]That was cool.
[408:29.27]Alright, getting there.
[408:32.05]Spam jump.
[408:32.85]It's heavy swings.
[408:35.23]Guys, what do you want me to do?
[408:37.65]By any means necessary, I gotta make sure I don't just get killed by shit.
[408:39.76]Don't let them get to you.
[408:40.98]See, they're making fun of you for using something that's actually good in the game to dissuade you from doing it.
[408:46.69]so that they can make fun of you when you do something also less efficient.
[408:50.37]It's going to just keep happening.
[408:51.39]They're in your head, man.
[409:00.37]I haven't been live this whole time.
[409:01.65]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[409:04.37]Then who have you been talking to?
[409:05.79]Who is he talking to?
[409:07.05]I'm just having fun with my friend.
[409:09.86]I told you I didn't feel that good and I wasn't streaming today.
[409:11.92]Okay.
[409:16.89]That makes me feel worse that you weren't listening to me earlier.
[409:19.46]I know, that's so much worse.
[409:21.12]That is like a thousand times worse.
[409:24.94]This is what his full attention is.
[409:26.34]Where are you going?
[409:28.38]You doing roleplay?
[409:29.19]You doing some clergy?
[409:31.63]Here they, here they, everyone part of it.
[409:34.43]No, just pick the item that's here.
[409:37.66]Oh wow, lightning great bolts.
[409:45.82]Oh wow, like hear ye, hear ye.
[409:51.94]But the joke was that I'm not doing a bit.
[409:54.36]I just wanted you to get the item.
[410:05.78]You'll get them.
[410:07.44]You don't belong here now.
[410:15.64]Let's just run through all this.
[410:18.32]Yeah.
[410:19.80]I'm surprised these are all actually ghost mode.
[410:22.07]I know it's weird.
[410:35.32]What happened?
[410:37.64]This fucking goblin goon one shot me.
[410:45.97]just some regular dude oh I think I have uh I might have um here I'm resetting it lol I might have had a what uh I might have the debuffs oh my god oh I'm just running to you um
[411:10.90]You just spawned everybody on me too.
[411:12.72]Yeah, that's fine because you're really powerful and you're capable.
[411:16.18]Like I just launched a nuke.
[411:29.43]Did I forget the way we're even supposed to be going?
[411:35.21]I think we've dropped down, don't we?
[411:43.31]Do we just do we go drop down somewhere?
[411:46.15]I don't remember.
[411:47.09]I thought you like you come out this way, then it summons things, then you go back and it opens up a different area or I don't know.
[411:53.45]It's been a long time.
[411:54.59]I think we go.
[411:55.39]I don't.
[411:56.15]I think we actually.
[411:57.24]Oh, but wait, wait, wait, wait.
[412:00.10]Over here.
[412:04.56]I think that's different.
[412:05.24]That's where you get the like the super omega laser beam sword.
[412:08.82]I wonder what's here then.
[412:10.13]Oh my god.
[412:10.93]What a jump.
[412:11.55]You completely missed.
[412:12.65]What a jump.
[412:14.16]I didn't even jump forward.
[412:15.20]I did like the tiniest, smallest hop I've ever seen.
[412:18.00]Yeah, that was a complete whiff.
[412:25.57]Anything over here?
[412:26.47]No.
[412:33.13]I just want to go up to Lycia.
[412:37.27]What was that?
[412:39.59]Oh, my God.
[412:40.73]Okay, this is... There's a dragon over here.
[412:44.96]A big one.
[412:48.86]Not a small dragon.
[412:53.80]Yeah, we just went the wrong way.
[412:55.34]There's a different path up here.
[412:56.46]This is where the Sword of Night and Flame is, right?
[413:01.81]Yeah.
[413:07.39]You might need to go back to the bonfire.
[413:10.05]Okay.
[413:13.75]Did you spawn or are you not spawned?
[413:16.63]I ran up to where we should have ran already.
[413:24.47]I think I'm going the right way, aren't I?
[413:28.11]I don't know.
[413:28.71]I think this is the right way.
[413:29.51]Wait, isn't this the right way?
[413:30.47]I think I'm going the right way.
[413:31.61]You're going the right way?
[413:32.80]I think I'm going the right way.
[413:34.14]No, you're going the wrong way.
[413:35.10]No, I'm going the right way.
[413:38.14]I'm 100% going the right way.
[413:39.94]You're going the wrong way.
[413:41.48]You're on the wrong way.
[413:43.00]I'm on a bonfire right now.
[413:44.07]Where are you?
[413:45.15]Like a new bonfire you haven't been to, but I don't think that I can warp you here because you haven't been here.
[413:51.09]Am I not going the right way?
[413:53.27]You're not going the right way.
[413:54.55]We don't wait because you come up this way and then.
[413:56.66]Because we were in here.
[414:08.70]And then out here.
[414:09.54]Okay.
[414:18.07]I was going the right way.
[414:18.73]Yeah, then over here.
[414:25.58]I mean, I have no idea where you are.
[414:31.12]I was going the right way.
[414:36.53]I don't think that's true.
[414:42.77]Yes, I know.
[414:43.79]I promise you I'm going the right way.
[414:47.85]You have to look at your stream to see what the... Oh, you are going the right way.
[414:52.96]I've been telling you I was going the right way.
[414:55.12]It took a long way to get to the right way.
[415:00.50]It may have been the long way, but it was the correct way.
[415:07.18]Okay.
[415:11.42]Is there another bonfire up here?
[415:13.04]Yeah.
[415:17.69]That fucking bowl's wearing your head down, dude.
[415:19.93]It actually is.
[415:20.45]I need to take it off.
[415:35.64]This is how my mom and dad argue on road trips.
[415:42.39]Guy showing off with his mom and dad.
[415:44.25]OK.
[415:51.60]Cool, I got I got miniature Ronnie.
[415:55.12]And the finger Slayer blade.
[415:57.68]really isn't that aren't those both the same quest I think they are this weapon is so dumb it's just like that it's like just a wall just like a piece of a wall it's like the chair of a it's a leg of a chair this is an expensive chair which is a big big hand
[416:29.78]Nice swing, loser.
[416:39.45]Big hand is here.
[416:40.27]Big hand.
[416:41.01]Big hand is more important than archer, isn't it?
[416:44.17]Big hand is more dangerous than the archer.
[416:46.23]Archer, you can easily dodge.
[416:54.26]But the archer hits you and stuns you and then you get hit by the big hand.
[416:57.57]Yeah, well, if you get hit.
[417:00.75]Big bear, don't go left or right.
[417:03.07]Which way?
[417:03.69]This is a mobile game ad.
[417:07.33]Which way do you pick?
[417:08.83]Oh, I don't know.
[417:09.33]Maybe I'll go this way.
[417:10.37]They always pick the shittiest way.
[417:12.29]Yeah.
[417:21.51]Ooh, I got sword dance.
[417:23.23]Dance.
[417:28.03]I heard what this was, but OK, no, I know.
[417:30.67]I think I know.
[417:32.27]But I don't know that's up and the boss is literally right here.
[417:35.54]Yeah, I know, but I thought there was like a shortcut you open there.
[417:38.78]OK, you ready to fight mad soldier?
[417:40.64]I'm ready to fight a magma worm 3.
[417:49.32]Get up.
[417:52.15]My game is lagging so bad.
[417:58.33]Oh my gosh, she's raining people on us.
[418:04.93]When do we get to fight her?
[418:12.24]They're beating me by making me run out of stamina.
[418:15.76]All right.
[418:16.76]Don't be so cocky here because they're just dive bombing.
[418:21.08]You're going to dodge that.
[418:27.07]Oh, because we have to kill the ones with the aura.
[418:32.57]I'm sorry, my bloodlust.
[418:34.85]It's alright, Aaron.
[418:40.49]I love the dive.
[418:41.21]I love the design of this fight.
[418:42.35]This is amazing.
[418:42.85]This should have been the real fight.
[418:44.68]This should have been the actual fight.
[418:53.16]Watch out for the explosive.
[418:57.08]Watch out.
[418:57.54]Explosive inbound.
[419:05.06]Beat it, right?
[419:08.39]Now, here's where this gets really wacky.
[419:09.67]There's not a part two to this, right?
[419:11.91]I have no idea.
[419:15.13]I hope not.
[419:18.85]Okay, when does she land?
[419:26.62]No, stop it!
[419:27.52]Stop it, Anakin!
[419:28.66]You're killing younglings!
[419:35.84]What's going on?
[419:37.07]I don't know.
[419:37.59]I was, like, waiting to see if, like... She's not spawning the ones we need to kill.
[419:43.27]I think... Oh, no, she broke, right?
[419:45.81]Yeah, she broke.
[420:00.16]Oh my goodness.
[420:01.44]I hope I don't die here.
[420:02.92]There's no way I die in this.
[420:04.20]There's no way I die.
[420:05.34]What a shameful boss to die to.
[420:07.58]It would be so shameful.
[420:11.18]This book won't stop hitting me.
[420:15.82]What a shameful boss.
[420:27.72]I think her strategy is to try and make you feel bad.
[420:52.06]I think the one we have to kill is up there.
[420:53.32]No, alright, we're good.
[420:54.98]Pray for no phase two, seriously.
[421:00.45]thank god yeah got a talisman pouch I have I have like four talismans pouches but only one talisman yeah we need more pouches no the other way I said the other way the other way but I like I only how many you have how many do you have stop dude please stop this is not good
[421:31.43]I wonder if there's an item back here.
[421:33.35]Nope.
[421:35.13]Do you want to go visit Pitya?
[421:36.23]Do you like Pitya?
[421:38.81]Little old Pitya?
[421:42.12]Um... What?
[421:46.76]Okay, so... Next step...
[421:56.49]I promise I'm coming.
[421:57.51]I think we go back down that other way and we drop down and then you go into the church again and you talk to Pitya and he's a merchant.
[422:05.90]I need to upgrade this weapon.
[422:07.78]I need to actually go do that.
[422:09.86]Do you have enough souls?
[422:11.10]You should have enough souls.
[422:12.06]I definitely do at this point, yeah.
[422:14.92]So we need to go back.
[422:15.44]What is making me stand up?
[422:16.40]I don't know.
[422:17.34]I just want to level.
[422:20.38]It's like forcing me to stand up.
[422:21.80]It's weird.
[422:22.14]Come this way.
[422:23.02]I want to level this up.
[422:24.46]No, come this way.
[422:25.03]We're already here.
[422:27.57]take two seconds okay all right all right I'm here two seconds I forgot to blink you haven't blinked in the last hour feels like it can you do that with your souls
[422:59.02]Oh, that's where all the pots are.
[423:01.38]Ow.
[423:06.00]And not pots this time, though.
[423:12.88]Oh, my God.
[423:19.18]Glove ready up.
[423:20.58]Nice.
[423:30.00]Okay.
[423:41.19]Sleep tight, baby.
[423:44.83]What the fuck?
[423:47.38]Sleep tight.
[424:00.68]somewhat lost and confused I thought no no something very different we keep going down and then you end up jumping to that thing okay would he get away from me I'm so I don't want to jump with these he's going to attack me keep going
[424:34.52]oh my god it's the he turned into the boy I didn't know I didn't care about that one I didn't give it a voice oh shit I'm getting out of here is that the meme because he turned into a titan is that what I would say if I were like funny
[424:58.75]What would someone funny say?
[424:59.79]You need to apologize for that.
[425:02.36]No, you need to apologize because that's... I didn't know he could do that.
[425:08.29]Well, he came all the way this way for like one item.
[425:13.10]What is that usually?
[425:13.82]I think that is usually it is.
[425:18.69]OK, I'm going to die if I go down there, so I'm not going to.
[425:23.05]OK, well, I can't teleport because this fucking Titan over here won't stop.
[425:28.87]Yeah, well, there's like a Chimera fighting me now.
[425:31.47]Like, we really shouldn't have done that.
[425:33.21]I don't know why I followed you.
[425:34.29]I should have just left.
[425:41.19]I really was hoping we could go to different areas.
[425:45.01]I think we can.
[425:45.53]I think you can just go somewhere else.
[425:48.27]I mean, whenever we waypoint travel.
[425:50.16]Here, I'm resetting so we can travel.
[425:51.54]Okay.
[425:54.92]Where do you want to go?
[425:57.84]You wanted to go upgrade.
[425:59.04]Yes, I do.
[426:00.52]That would be nice.
[426:03.31]Leave Aaron in 2021.
[426:04.73]We need a new meme funeral.
[426:07.57]Oh, I forgot about that.
[426:09.18]They haven't even finished that show yet.
[426:10.96]How can the meme be dead before the show's over?
[426:14.60]The problem with the show is they keep doing final season.
[426:18.68]Attack on Titan, last season, part two.
[426:21.52]Final season, part three.
[426:24.82]Eren's final moments, part one.
[426:31.06]All right, I'm picking this thing.
[426:35.12]I'm doing this.
[426:36.12]We're going to upgrade this thing all the way.
[426:40.47]Okay, I need 30.
[426:41.17]I need one smithing stone five.
[426:43.57]Do you have one?
[426:54.22]No, I have a four and a seven.
[426:55.60]I'm the weird one.
[426:56.18]I want to make sure everyone knows that.
[427:00.16]We've got a four and then a seven and then like an ancient dragon one.
[427:05.12]That's good enough.
[427:07.73]Okay, what is yours upgraded to?
[427:09.42]Can I like drop your finger on the ground for you?
[427:11.58]This is plus five at this point.
[427:13.70]Plus four.
[427:14.06]You're just making up numbers.
[427:21.98]Okay, you want to go back to Ray of Lucaria with like a... Wait, we did that, right?
[427:25.11]No, we didn't.
[427:25.83]The Placidusa Rax.
[427:27.31]That's going to be interesting.
[427:28.91]But yes.
[427:30.43]Okay.
[427:34.33]What do I need to upgrade one more time?
[427:37.37]I gotta have.
[427:38.17]Hold on.
[427:42.69]Should I just put points into intelligence or no?
[427:45.20]Level in?
[427:45.64]Yeah.
[427:47.76]I can reach back in a minute.
[427:48.76]Okay.
[427:57.29]Let's go.
[428:06.98]We need to go to... Which one is it?
[428:11.94]It is... Without the map, it's kind of hard to see.
[428:15.46]All right, where are we going?
[428:16.35]Church of the Cuckoo or... What is it?
[428:19.21]Debate Parlor.
[428:24.43]It's worth it for the sword.
[428:27.13]Yeah, I'll be able to do a full respec after this.
[428:28.87]This is perfect.
[428:32.90]No amount of intelligence will fix your brain.
[428:34.82]Actually, I think a lot of intelligence would fix my brain because I'd be smarter.
[428:42.05]Stir, can we get a Lala, please?
[428:43.45]A lot of people are asking for it.
[428:45.09]A Lala?
[428:46.19]Yes, a Lala.
[428:48.07]Like the guy from Better Call Saul?
[428:54.15]Yes.
[428:58.59]I don't think I can do that.
[429:01.41]I feel like you probably could.
[429:02.33]Was it Lala or Lalo?
[429:03.69]I think it was Lalo.
[429:05.03]I don't think you could do it.
[429:08.31]I don't know what you're asking for.
[429:10.25]To do an impression.
[429:12.25]Is that what you were actually asking for?
[429:14.13]Because I feel like I went way off track.
[429:16.07]No, I was asking for you to do an impression of Lala.
[429:20.17]Can you give an example?
[429:21.67]Yes.
[429:29.46]Hold on.
[429:29.70]I just don't want to get hit.
[429:42.00]Just say lala.
[429:44.54]No, that's not how I... Lala.
[429:48.16]I don't know.
[429:49.16]What am I a part of right now?
[429:51.44]Never mind.
[429:53.76]Why is it never mind now?
[429:56.42]I was busy doing something.
[430:01.61]There's a secret down there.
[430:12.69]This is not from Breaking Bad.
[430:15.25]Okay, I thought you guys were linking.
[430:21.35]I was asking you for lines that this character says.
[430:25.76]I can't remember any.
[430:26.76]Can you just tell a joke already?
[430:37.36]There.
[430:39.40]Okay, and what is that?
[430:41.90]Don't really even know dude like Here comes
[431:11.99]Block it.
[431:12.53]Tank it.
[431:13.41]Block it.
[431:13.95]Tanking.
[431:27.72]You can't even see where his body is.
[431:29.98]It seems like he can't see us either because he doesn't really actually attack you.
[431:35.36]No, not really.
[431:36.18]Dude, what the fuck?
[431:46.49]I can't believe Placidusex is the queen of the full moon.
[431:52.23]I still have not got an Estus upgrade.
[431:55.85]Okay, easy.
[431:56.23]And I sure hope he's aggroed to you.
[431:58.39]Because I'm just rolling at random intervals.
[432:05.16]I think he's on you.
[432:07.08]He is.
[432:08.32]He does not like you.
[432:09.26]He just wants to kill you so bad.
[432:19.90]I have no more healing This is fucking terrible There's there's nothing I could do there and then I'm I didn't even realize he was I I don't know you're you're naked Ow
[432:51.24]Dude, his ass is so big.
[432:52.68]Okay.
[433:00.35]Well, at least you didn't have to deal with the infinite flicker strike teleportation.
[433:03.93]I'm inside the wall ability.
[433:07.33]There's no way I beat this.
[433:09.73]Here we go.
[433:10.84]Dodge it.
[433:11.22]I just did.
[433:14.84]I don't know that you dodged it or that he spawned in a situation where he couldn't swing at you.
[433:19.23]I just dodged it right there.
[433:22.33]Just dodged it right there again.
[433:23.43]Yeah, I don't know about that.
[433:27.99]You dodged that.
[433:35.22]I think he has a second phase.
[433:37.90]Just like Rinala, I don't think the random enemies properly trigger second phases.
[433:45.07]Where is he?
[433:46.49]He's coming.
[433:48.85]Or not.
[433:50.93]I think he's stuck in the wall.
[434:01.76]Die, come on, die, die, die, die, die.
[434:03.42]He fell out of the world.
[434:04.34]Come on, die.
[434:06.84]He literally fell all the way down.
[434:09.40]Come on, really?
[434:15.53]Yo, I can't imagine fighting like Radon in this room.
[434:18.67]No.
[434:22.45]Like, if he actually got to do his meteor, where would you go?
[434:40.12]Use your magical potion.
[435:02.73]So what's the plan?
[435:03.33]You want to go for it again?
[435:04.12]I think if I can survive the teleportation phase, it could be better.
[435:12.58]Can you drop golden seeds?
[435:13.78]Because if you can, can I just... Do you... No, you can't.
[435:20.92]Wait, can you?
[435:23.62]I think I can.
[435:26.85]No, I need the... What is the flask upgrade one?
[435:29.83]Sacred Tear.
[435:31.37]That's what I need.
[435:32.69]Yeah, I only have one of those.
[435:34.73]It's actually really bad when you need to drink twice to fill your health.
[435:37.06]Yeah, I'm drinking like three or four times right now.
[435:59.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[436:15.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[436:18.96]Take ten of these.
[436:21.00]Put it on your bar.
[436:28.61]Okay.
[436:29.67]That negates, like, a ton of damage.
[436:32.03]Like, almost all physical damage or something.
[436:34.87]How long do they last?
[436:36.08]I don't know, but you have ten of them.
[436:39.08]And if we need more, I know where they are.
[436:43.45]It only blocks physical damage, but that's a big deal.
[436:59.22]Alright, so before we go in this door, fucking snap into a Slim Jim.
[437:02.94]Ready?
[437:03.16]Nope.
[437:30.66]oh my god
[437:54.94]I'm what?
[437:55.44]I rolled.
[438:08.87]Here it is again.
[438:10.05]Really?
[438:10.63]That's unfair.
[438:12.23]Can you jump over this?
[438:16.47]I doubt it.
[438:17.43]Nope.
[438:29.84]He's cheesing us this time.
[438:31.70]We're actually not in a terrible position.
[438:34.90]Okay, I'm eating another... Where is he?
[438:44.33]He's in this chandelier.
[438:47.35]Chandelier!
[438:47.67]He's in the bookcase now!
[438:49.59]Oh, shit.
[438:55.56]No, not... No, dude.
[438:57.54]Come on.
[438:58.19]What was that?
[438:58.83]That was horseshit.
[439:00.19]That actually was stupid.
[439:14.45]That, same as that?
[439:15.64]Yep.
[439:18.80]You're not in a bad spot.
[439:19.54]You're all right.
[439:20.36]Do you still... I have no more healing.
[439:22.92]Mm-hmm.
[439:27.01]Better than last time.
[439:32.27]You can hear him.
[439:36.51]Just fucking rolled through the floor.
[439:39.21]That's what happened to me last time.
[439:40.67]I thought he died.
[439:41.45]That would've been awesome.
[439:45.66]Hey, it's still winnable.
[439:46.68]Yeah, it's true.
[440:08.40]I don't know what he's doing.
[440:09.88]No, you're dead.
[440:13.97]No, you're alright.
[440:16.45]I thought he was doing the thing in the ground.
[440:18.25]Yeah, I was trying to look up to see what move he was even doing.
[440:20.73]I think I wasted a lot of time doing it.
[440:25.68]I think we can do it.
[440:28.24]yeah I think you got like you shouldn't have died that early yeah sorry there bud but like like I think you shouldn't have died there if you watch the vod he I got hit by a swipe and then he started doing the breath immediately directly pinpointing my exact location that I was standing right there and hit me directly right before even iframes to kick down yeah but like I feel like I feel like you shouldn't have died there I really you shouldn't have died there either you still did
[440:57.25]Yeah, well, I feel like you should have been there to help.
[440:59.87]I was.
[441:00.07]But you died.
[441:03.90]Dermic's a good point.
[441:05.28]Hey!
[441:06.08]Hey!
[441:17.41]I got a feeling this is the one.
[441:23.91]I had that feeling too, but I don't know.
[441:25.99]We've been married for awhile now and.
[441:29.57]We can come.
[441:33.75]Trying to get it.
[441:37.07]Where's the ball?
[441:39.80]I'm at the elevator.
[441:43.14]Weird.
[441:59.76]Alright, let's focus on surviving and focus on thriving.
[442:07.80]Being good.
[442:10.36]Alright.
[442:11.23]Okay, surviving and being good is our strat.
[442:15.11]Eat your thing.
[442:17.45]Hey, don't forget who got those, by the way.
[442:18.99]I'm not completely useless.
[442:22.75]The trade merchant?
[442:24.23]Alright, no more fucking around.
[442:25.21]Let's go.
[442:25.49]This is the real one.
[442:40.15]Stop fucking around.
[442:41.33]I didn't even see where he swung, dude.
[442:43.71]There's no way to see it.
[443:00.70]That's unfortunate.
[443:03.16]We're good.
[443:09.60]Is he doing it again?
[443:10.14]He is.
[443:22.69]Who knows what he's doing?
[443:24.77]Can't see his body.
[443:34.10]I really feel like you shouldn't have died there.
[443:36.52]What was I supposed to do?
[443:38.08]There was nothing I could do there.
[443:40.24]I've got four flasks this time.
[444:02.17]What?
[444:04.49]be honest I don't even know what hit you like the attack was over and that did like so much damage he's just he just fills the whole arena I mean to be fair this is one of the last bosses of the elden ring so is there anywhere else we can go there's tons of places we can go
[444:45.37]He just fills the whole arena with that yellow shit.
[444:52.01]Honestly, you could do this.
[444:53.06]I think we could.
[444:53.70]The problem is just that yellow flame, if you're in the wrong spot, you're dead.
[444:58.92]I think I'm just going to let him kill me here.
[445:02.10]Then we give it one more try.
[445:03.14]One more college try.
[445:05.46]It's hard to know what is the wrong spot, too, because he's so big.
[445:20.32]I think with your, like, if you were just here, the extra amount of DPS, he'd be dead.
[445:27.05]Yeah, I'm telling you, I got completely screwed over twice in a row.
[445:35.07]Let's go.
[445:35.47]Let's fucking get this boy.
[445:38.21]We can do it.
[445:43.19]Okay.
[445:45.49]It is winnable.
[445:46.04]It's very winnable.
[445:56.17]What if you were good at the game?
[445:59.55]Um, I don't know.
[446:07.92]No, no, not going on another.
[446:10.52]I'm not.
[446:11.16]No, I'm not going on.
[446:13.30]No, we're not.
[446:14.85]No, I'm having this, which we just I was just walked off the edge.
[446:41.32]Okay.
[446:43.52]This time, I hope I do not get double hit by that yellow flame.
[446:50.96]That's what happened last time.
[446:52.65]It's like, it was still a little faint whisper of that shit that hit me twice.
[446:56.75]I don't get hit by it once.
[446:59.51]If you fall on the ground from flame, I don't know if you know, but don't start rolling.
[447:03.79]Just like lay on the ground.
[447:05.17]Thank you.
[447:06.01]Thank you.
[447:07.37]I don't.
[447:08.31]It really is that sarcastic?
[447:09.81]No, no, no.
[447:10.13]I'm dead serious.
[447:10.69]I did.
[447:10.97]I actually did not think about that.
[447:12.75]It's true.
[447:13.33]You get a lot more iframes if you lay on the ground.
[447:16.07]A lot of dragons will like put you on the ground.
[447:17.67]If you panic and get up, it hits you instantly again.
[447:20.23]I, you know, I'm not even kidding.
[447:21.43]I did not know that.
[447:24.92]OK, let's go.
[447:28.63]I'm still not sure.
[447:29.83]No, I swear.
[447:30.85]I promise.
[447:31.53]I promise.
[447:45.95]My game lagged like, yeah, like, okay.
[447:48.54]My game froze and then I fell on the ground from the fire and it like, it kept a buffered roll and I stood up into the fire again.
[447:57.55]I probably should just die here, shouldn't I?
[448:00.49]We were doing really good.
[448:01.45]We were doing alright.
[448:02.29]I think we got through his health pretty quickly.
[448:15.38]Yeah, you actually do a lot of damage compared to what I've been doing.
[448:17.65]I mean, I'm kind of... I think you could beat him.
[448:35.78]Does he know about the dodge button?
[448:38.28]He's trying to get me to growl at you, and I'm not going to do it.
[448:42.27]He did it.
[448:43.07]He's more mad than I am.
[448:45.85]Stop that.
[448:47.47]Oh, do you not like that?
[448:48.91]Does that make you uncomfortable?
[448:50.45]Can Otto hear me?
[448:51.19]Is Otto uncomfortable?
[448:54.90]Or do you just not like dark people?
[448:59.66]My room is just filled with water.
[449:02.28]Let's go.
[449:07.83]Yeah, this one's winnable.
[449:08.99]Is your monitor turned on?
[449:10.01]Oh my God.
[449:12.41]What the fuck?
[449:14.03]Your mom was turned on last night.
[449:16.47]Chatter.
[449:18.61]Because of me.
[449:34.84]Yeah, what the heck?
[449:35.68]Stop.
[449:36.96]Rude.
[449:39.34]All right, so here's the deal.
[449:42.32]If we don't beat him this time, we're going to go fight another couple of bosses.
[449:47.26]Okay.
[449:48.20]Okay.
[449:48.68]There's like a million catacombs we can go down into.
[449:51.18]There's tons of stuff.
[449:52.11]We don't have to fight like the last, the top three, top five last bosses in the whole game.
[449:59.41]We can come back.
[450:03.25]Eat your Slim Jim.
[450:36.45]What the fuck are you doing, game?
[450:38.83]Alright, we're fine.
[450:40.39]Fucking slay a queen.
[450:55.11]I'm going to slay this queen.
[450:58.41]Here comes the thingy.
[451:03.97]Yeah, we can be hitting him during that.
[451:05.41]We got time.
[451:06.28]I am terrified of that.
[451:07.26]I'll be honest.
[451:13.88]Watch out.
[451:14.22]He's spraying that shit over here.
[451:16.58]What the fuck are you talking?
[451:19.52]Okay, stop being a weirdo.
[451:22.47]Yeah, I've gone through a lot of flasters, please.
[451:27.81]I prefer phase two at this point.
[451:30.09]I don't know.
[451:30.79]We're doing okay.
[451:31.87]Everything's fine.
[451:33.69]that was a quick transition though from what I think he hit the wall oh you're in trouble he's doing that stupid over there I'm good
[452:01.20]You're in trouble.
[452:01.96]No, no, I'm fine.
[452:03.46]I'm fine.
[452:09.70]Playing it safe.
[452:10.84]Yeah, me too.
[452:22.61]And until he like just hops, changes his angle and lights the whole room on fire.
[452:39.73]He can do it Where the fuck were they Maybe maybe not
[453:09.74]Where do you want to go?
[453:17.61]The guy's in the wall.
[453:18.83]I can't see where the fuck he is.
[453:20.53]Do you want to go again?
[453:26.95]You want to prove the haters wrong.
[453:29.57]No, I don't.
[453:31.06]You want to tell them this is a ridiculous boss fight in this tiny supper.
[453:36.60]One more.
[453:40.32]Alright, one more.
[453:43.26]And actually, I think it might be better.
[453:44.74]I have like... Somebody's... Lightning liver.
[453:47.54]Somebody's got it right.
[453:48.74]I want to just respec.
[453:50.21]And if we beat him, that means I get to respec.
[453:52.59]Yeah.
[453:54.85]I just want that sweet spot.
[454:00.01]You think I'm going to go on like a... Use left trigger?
[454:02.71]I don't think... I don't have enough intelligence to do it.
[454:06.23]I don't think I can even do that move.
[454:10.17]Don't you need... Hold on.
[454:14.59]What do you mean?
[454:19.29]You're too dumb to press left trigger.
[454:20.93]That's true.
[454:25.83]Do a fully charged heavy.
[454:26.79]I think it's not going to do that much more damage.
[454:29.74]Alright, let's go.
[454:38.21]do extra damage but I have to hold it for much longer I'll try it see so
[455:16.82]come on watch out for that fire he might do it usually does it like right now comes this yeah I'm like basically out of flasks already
[455:48.27]Jesus.
[455:54.69]It's just so hard to see what his body's doing.
[456:02.09]Jesus.
[456:12.00]It's like I'm hitting a mountain.
[456:14.68]All right.
[456:15.06]Pull up.
[456:15.32]Pull up.
[456:15.60]Pull up.
[456:16.00]Pull up.
[456:19.28]He's going to the second phase.
[456:20.14]All right.
[456:20.68]Weird.
[456:21.10]Weird.
[456:21.66]Eat another one of your... You know what I mean?
[456:24.11]My goober berries.
[456:24.77]Yes.
[456:27.19]Spread out, too.
[456:31.19]It's okay.
[456:31.83]We're good.
[456:32.21]We're good.
[456:32.71]Just have everybody chill out.
[456:36.24]Oh, no.
[456:44.40]You got to be shitting me.
[456:45.36]I dodged right through it.
[456:54.44]This is the one.
[456:58.48]Yeah!
[457:00.10]What?
[457:00.78]That was weird.
[457:01.40]I don't know what just happened, but he's over here.
[457:07.71]Bro, what are you doing over here, man?
[457:14.16]What?
[457:19.02]What?
[457:21.75]Dude, you got so much surface area here.
[457:23.37]Look at this.
[457:23.85]He's picked the same three spots.
[457:37.16]I'm so lucky that didn't hit me.
[457:38.58]All right, here comes the area effect bullshit.
[457:51.81]Where'd he go?
[457:54.01]He's going to drop it on me.
[457:56.31]I hope.
[457:56.75]Where did he go?
[457:57.31]Oh, he's teleporting.
[458:01.68]Yeah, the claw into the flame.
[458:06.02]What the fuck is he doing right now, man?
[458:08.14]He's doing laser beam.
[458:09.02]He hit him.
[458:47.45]fucking clown box I I thought you would have had them there too if that didn't hit you but like who can tell what oh you need to rest at the bonfire I'm still in the fight what that was so unfair what happened what did he just what did he do what did he just
[459:18.00]happened oh what happened he's not playing fair he's a weapon you have stats for uh I had it a stir currently owns it he still has it in his inventory the issue is not the damage you're doing more damage than me
[459:44.42]The issue is sometimes he uses flame attacks.
[459:48.28]So why did I... And then you die.
[459:50.32]Okay, so he did a flame attack.
[459:53.02]And then it was over.
[459:54.12]And then I died.
[459:55.44]Was that the laser?
[459:56.98]That's the one where he goes super psycho mode and does lasers in like 400 million directions.
[460:01.62]Oh my god.
[460:02.36]We both got hit by it.
[460:06.22]Oh, can we do a warming stone?
[460:10.83]Somebody said two-hand the shield.
[460:13.12]That's not a bad idea.
[460:14.32]That might actually work.
[460:16.06]I wonder.
[460:20.98]No, don't potion.
[460:22.74]Why?
[460:22.96]Because we can put a warming stone down before we go in.
[460:27.80]Fine.
[460:29.62]We can just chill out.
[460:30.56]We can talk about... I can't.
[460:33.63]I thought he was dead too.
[460:34.91]I thought his move was over.
[460:36.11]I don't even know what I got hit by.
[460:39.85]Don't go in.
[460:54.98]He was near a pillar.
[460:55.88]His laser explodes on contact with ground you stood near his head, which was near the pillar.
[461:01.38]And the laser beam exploded the pillar.
[461:06.63]Oh, that's so sad.
[461:07.65]That's so sad.
[461:10.11]Shots four and five clearly missed.
[461:19.37]I'm going to drop a warming stone during the phase transition as well.
[461:27.06]I didn't mean to do that.
[461:28.16]I'm just so shooken up right now.
[461:29.72]It's alright.
[461:32.12]We'll get it right here.
[461:50.95]You gotta... Seriously, dude.
[461:52.33]I'm dead.
[461:57.84]I got trapped.
[462:03.44]I got trapped.
[462:04.22]He did it twice in the same area.
[462:09.70]I need you to focus up, dude.
[462:11.84]The guild needs this.
[462:16.68]Okay, you have no idea how hard I was just holding and not just getting wicked pissed.
[462:21.66]Okay, we're good.
[462:24.55]I'm so glad you said that because that was really funny and it just like... Was it?
[462:29.01]It was like really funny.
[462:32.19]The fact that the guild needs me right now is... That's so funny.
[462:38.10]I was about to be like... The fuck do you know?
[462:42.90]You're going to do like a noise like that.
[462:44.38]No one's going to know what it means, but like you would know.
[462:46.70]Okay.
[463:22.69]It's a combination of being in the right place, not being too greedy, getting good RNG on the moves.
[463:30.86]I mean, the area is tiny.
[463:32.30]There's not a whole lot of wiggle room.
[463:34.18]I forget how you even double hand your shield on your offhand.
[463:40.47]I can, but I was just told that that does not help.
[463:43.85]Oh, okay.
[463:45.17]From what I was told.
[463:46.55]Could be wrong.
[463:50.44]Let's try it again.
[463:51.80]I'm only going to use the clam powder, the clam chowder in the second phase.
[463:56.87]I used all mine.
[464:01.05]Oh, I sold like six.
[464:02.92]Really?
[464:03.16]Yeah.
[464:40.35]That's the clawed fire to end.
[464:45.41]I just know where to go.
[464:53.88]No, no, no!
[464:59.63]No!
[465:21.72]Nice, nice, he's staggered.
[465:23.14]ooh all right dropping a warming stone in the center yep he's going up so
[466:04.57]Easy, easy.
[466:05.85]Careful.
[466:06.03]All right.
[466:11.00]Smelling warming stone in the center.
[466:18.62]I had no idea where he was.
[466:20.24]He says, all right.
[466:25.38]Fire incoming.
[466:30.59]Thank you.
[466:56.37]You can't be serious.
[466:59.13]All right.
[466:59.47]It's all right.
[466:59.85]It's all right.
[467:00.69]He killed me instantly with the laser.
[467:02.46]Yeah, I saw you die in one shot.
[467:10.15]You got it.
[467:10.45]You got it.
[467:40.18]Come on.
[467:41.08]For the guild.
[467:42.04]Where the fuck is he?
[467:43.14]I don't know.
[467:53.58]Okay.
[467:55.00]I couldn't even hit him.
[468:21.00]I thought he was doing the fire after the swing, so I started trying to run.
[468:24.14]I know there was like a return swing.
[468:25.82]OK, so the lightning.
[468:29.37]Once he's in when he's in phase two.
[468:31.93]Do not be in front of him for any reason.
[468:34.75]He does that laser light show and it instantly kills you.
[468:38.29]That's what killed you the other time, and it goes on for a really long time.
[468:42.85]That's unfortunate.
[468:44.15]I'm out of warming stones too.
[468:45.24]I think they helped a lot.
[468:46.04]I don't know if you have any.
[468:47.81]uh let me check I don't think I do though that was so close I think we can do it warming stones I don't think I have any no I don't think so I might have I mean buff on I don't know how I would check we could take rune arcs couldn't we I do have a debuff on I had a reduced attack debuff
[469:16.47]uh apparently the warming stones heal the bots oh do they that's so funny oh all right I mean that was that was pretty good that was pretty good this is tough this is not easy this is tricky
[469:40.76]weapon is a stagger do jump attacks I mean I do it just it's hard to get in there but I do oh my god okay I am I want to see if we can I forget if there's a shortcut over here because I need to rest up on fire get rid of my debuff
[470:00.87]you have a debuff right now or no you didn't yeah I think during that fight I had a reduced attack debuff the whole time really well let's just let's do this let's go up and take care of this what is going on because of the weird way that like last time I died and you had to reset it and then I resp I don't know I don't know what happened or how long I had it let's turn the stupid ball off
[470:29.59]Well, we can just do this shortcut for now on.
[470:32.36]I'm getting rid of that ball.
[470:37.52]Well, I'm saying the shortcut ignores the ball.
[470:39.42]Oh, never mind.
[470:39.98]This giant dog up here.
[470:40.86]I don't care about that anymore.
[470:44.73]I'm going to rest.
[470:45.35]I'll be back.
[470:48.63]OK.
[470:51.47]Shortcut is literally going to be worse, apparently why?
[470:54.94]Uh, it seems a lot better because of the random enemies that are there.
[470:58.10]They're not, like, super threatening the way they normally are.
[471:03.02]Where did you go?
[471:03.44]All the way back?
[471:05.22]Yeah.
[471:06.05]I rested.
[471:12.71]It's usually worse.
[471:15.09]Yeah, because they usually spam, like, homing magic at you, but right now it's like...
[471:20.30]Undead that are just like kind of looking at me.
[471:22.52]I just ran right by her.
[471:23.64]It was no problem.
[471:25.24]It was way easier.
[471:27.06]And then we don't need to deal with the ball.
[471:29.44]Let me actually... I have six flasks.
[471:32.31]I need to get my heal back up.
[471:35.03]Okay, I should... Man, I forgot, but I should take my mana flask off.
[471:41.33]Because I'm not really casting... Jesus fuck, that was longer range than I thought.
[471:45.19]I'm just... I don't even care.
[471:46.53]I'm just going to go back.
[471:47.79]Okay.
[471:50.78]I can beat this boss by myself.
[471:54.89]You respawned at the bonfire, right?
[471:57.03]Mm-hmm.
[471:58.19]I'm killing myself.
[471:59.49]And I'm going to come back with you so that I can reset my flask.
[472:02.85]Like, one extra flask would help a lot.
[472:04.56]Yeah.
[472:06.58]We've gotten him two or three times down to, like, less than 5%.
[472:16.16]When are you going to play the Great Ace Attorney games?
[472:17.90]My uncle doesn't care because he doesn't know who you are, but I do.
[472:22.92]What does your uncle have to do with any of that?
[472:31.51]I don't expect your uncle to know who I am.
[472:33.63]I'll play it.
[472:46.62]Yeah, but he's gonna play Jade Cocoon first.
[472:49.12]I actually need to find that game.
[472:51.07]Are you guys just hoping that the second boss is gonna be easier when you kill this one?
[473:18.48]I don't think there is one.
[473:20.43]There wasn't a phase two for Rayo Lucario.
[473:23.45]Would there be a phase two for this?
[473:24.81]Well, I mean, that boss doesn't usually have phase two, the base boss, but I still don't... Dude, like, it doesn't matter.
[473:30.25]We're going to win right now.
[473:31.17]I don't want to hear anyone say, well, but... Nothing matters.
[473:35.06]We're about to win right now.
[473:35.84]So, like, it doesn't even matter what you're saying.
[473:38.54]You know, that's a good point.
[473:40.22]Because we are... Hey, VOD watchers, this is the one.
[473:43.24]Skip to here.
[473:54.40]That was just a bad start.
[473:55.68]My guy just got screwed.
[474:02.80]Again.
[474:03.02]Again, just really poor.
[474:04.50]Really just bad fucking start.
[474:06.58]Overall, bad.
[474:09.48]It was just a bad start overall.
[474:11.18]It was a bad start overall.
[474:12.24]I could feel it the second we walked in the door.
[474:14.64]Okay.
[474:15.64]The vibe was off.
[474:16.78]The vibe was so wrong.
[474:18.65]was off completely just like I would I would do a move and he would time it perfectly to put something on the ground that uh you know what I mean it was just the vibe was just the vibes were off on that the fight always starts off three lightnings be aware be aware I know but just do the vibe I'm not disagreeing with you the vibe was off
[474:48.72]Dude, if I just had, like, Glintstone Omega Kamehameha, and then I could fucking Kamehameha him and then hit the Gritty.
[474:57.26]Hit the Gritty?
[475:00.70]Yeah.
[475:02.06]Okay, come on.
[475:03.00]He doesn't know.
[475:04.14]We can do it.
[475:06.42]We have been playing for eight hours.
[475:07.80]I mean, it might be hitting gamer fatigue.
[475:10.14]It's possible.
[475:12.85]Yeah, for, like, old people.
[475:17.57]We could be hitting gamer fatigue.
[475:19.63]For old people.
[475:21.75]You didn't even eat.
[475:24.65]Do I need to?
[475:25.63]Yeah.
[475:26.99]No, fasting.
[475:27.91]It keeps your mind present.
[475:29.24]Like, I'm on the hunt for some food, and that food is Pasadusus Axes.
[475:36.82]What is this character's name?
[475:39.62]Me Strong?
[475:40.48]No, no, no.
[475:41.12]The boss we're fighting.
[475:42.20]Get it right and spell it correctly, and I'll give you $100. $100.
[475:46.18]Pass.
[475:48.04]Placidusax?
[475:50.32]Okay, now do it for me.
[475:53.04]Do what for you?
[475:54.02]I don't know either.
[475:55.94]It's like Placidoxix is what I would have said.
[475:58.46]I think I could have done it if we took a moment, but I want to just fucking fight this thing.
[476:01.62]Could you be like focused?
[476:02.44]You like dodge the red lightning that's about to come down.
[476:06.20]Not take any like greed swings and like die in the first fucking phase.
[476:10.39]I didn't.
[476:13.85]You show me what you're made of for the guild.
[476:20.25]You got double hit by the fire guy, but I did I didn't know but you understand I didn't jump I didn't get up I did what you said Seems like I only got hit once What even just I hit my head on the fucking treasure box, I'm relaxed Guild needs you
[476:54.57]The fucking only fighter that's online at this time.
[477:00.29]You don't understand.
[477:01.03]I got so screwed.
[477:02.27]I mean, like, just run away.
[477:14.24]If you're worried you're going to get hit, you can also always... You actually can't go anywhere when he does that.
[477:18.74]Oh, my God.
[477:20.73]Did I do it?
[477:22.19]Yeah.
[477:23.17]I didn't...
[477:25.84]I thought you were going to yell at me and say don't do it.
[477:28.05]So I tried to predict it.
[477:29.01]I was on the ground the whole time.
[477:30.09]No, no, we're good.
[477:31.45]We're good.
[477:31.75]Everything's fine.
[477:32.83]We're good.
[477:33.13]We did a lot of damage.
[477:35.13]Everyone's screaming at me.
[477:36.13]You don't understand.
[477:36.65]The last few times, it's like, we're good.
[477:41.60]Oh, dodged.
[477:43.68]That was so stupid Bringing it back
[478:15.04]You can't even see when the rocks come out.
[478:16.82]It's such horse manure!
[478:21.77]Oh my... I'm just getting infinite combo'd.
[478:26.95]Beam.
[478:30.18]Fuck.
[478:38.40]It's a good thing I used three flasks for that.
[478:44.31]Focus!
[478:47.80]He's getting close to beam health.
[478:48.92]Like, don't get beamied.
[478:50.93]I'm going to try as hard as I can to not get beamed.
[478:58.79]Do we even know?
[478:59.64]Do we even know?
[479:00.84]Dude, do we even know?
[479:03.38]He's beaming into the wall.
[479:06.42]Now is our opportunity.
[479:14.95]That was such a huge RNG play right there.
[479:17.21]Come on.
[479:17.43]Come on.
[479:17.65]Come on.
[479:17.87]Kill him.
[479:18.45]Kill him.
[479:18.73]Come on.
[479:19.03]Like a boss, man.
[479:20.85]Like a fucking boss.
[479:21.69]Get him.
[479:23.52]Oh, thank.
[479:23.90]All right.
[479:24.12]No phase two.
[479:24.76]No phase two.
[479:25.52]No phase two.
[479:26.02]Uh-oh.
[479:34.52]Uh-oh.
[479:38.45]I skipped.
[479:39.01]I don't.
[479:40.53]What?
[479:40.77]What?
[479:42.95]Alright, we got it.
[479:43.63]We got it.
[479:43.87]We got it.
[479:44.31]Loretta sucks.
[479:46.45]It's the easiest boss of the fucking whole game.
[479:48.55]Just relax.
[479:50.39]Just take your time.
[480:07.87]Look at that damage.
[480:08.61]Look at that.
[481:02.73]Stop, don't laugh!
[481:03.99]Don't laugh!
[481:06.35]You're gonna get me going, don't!
[481:25.20]Are you... I'm alive.
[481:27.92]Stay alive, stay alive.
[481:34.89]Dude, if you have to just Warming Stone back there, do it.
[481:37.32]I don't have any.
[481:44.14]With my low HP, every once in a while, I'm going to hit one time and then run away to take aggro.
[482:07.88]Fucker.
[482:56.07]That one didn't count.
[483:04.84]Shit.
[483:07.42]Oh, this weapon is fucking slow as shit.
[483:10.84]With my sword alone, I was having a hard time getting a single hit in.
[483:16.52]Well, that was that was interesting.
[483:21.43]This is easy.
[483:28.43]bots oh I feel like I could have done that too it's just it's been so long since seeing that second phase
[483:37.80]I got fucking one shot by the bow.
[483:39.80]That thing is always so hard for me to dodge.
[483:41.48]Like in the beginning of Radon's fight, and he's like, I'm going to shoot one really slow missile at you across the map.
[483:46.48]I always mistime it.
[483:47.54]The bow?
[483:48.02]It's my weakness.
[483:48.88]You got to dodge forward.
[483:51.82]Only go forward.
[483:53.12]So you like, only dodge forward.
[483:55.50]If you dodge back, left or right, you'll get hit by it every time.
[483:58.69]Especially... Okay, so... Respawn and then go up the shortcut.
[484:06.05]I don't know why we went ball way.
[484:08.48]I don't know.
[484:09.67]I think I didn't remove my buff either.
[484:11.35]I don't know if I have one.
[484:14.49]Nice bald spot.
[484:15.51]Where?
[484:16.35]Where?
[484:16.59]I shouldn't have one because we both like did actual real dying.
[484:22.36]So I have a question.
[484:23.26]Is that always going to be Loretta?
[484:25.16]Yeah.
[484:26.86]Okay.
[484:36.25]Do I have grease?
[484:36.95]My chat keeps telling me to use grease, but actually, chat, I'm using an intellect sword, and it scales with arcane magic, and you can't put grease on magic swords.
[484:44.11]Your vibes are off, bro.
[484:45.19]When was the last time you guys hit the... No, no, no.
[484:47.01]Someone's saying, your vibes are off, man.
[484:48.21]When was the last time you hit the splanky?
[484:49.65]No, that's true.
[484:55.86]I feel better.
[484:57.68]I feel a lot better.
[484:58.86]We crushed Placidax.
[485:00.88]Placid.
[485:01.86]Placid, man.
[485:04.16]I feel pretty good now.
[485:08.78]What's your... What's that thing's weapon art that you said you can't use?
[485:12.01]I think it's a big, like, earthquake.
[485:13.97]It's a big, like, purple earthquake.
[485:19.51]Alright, let's try it again.
[485:27.58]Alright, vibes are better.
[485:28.72]I feel pretty good.
[485:29.76]Vibes have been returned.
[485:32.78]Yo, we're just chilling.
[485:35.47]We are super duper gamers.
[485:40.19]Just vibing out.
[485:44.97]I hurt a little bit.
[485:55.03]Just a bad start.
[485:55.81]Just a bad start.
[485:56.39]No, it really was though.
[485:57.51]Like I was fine.
[485:58.76]It's just I ran out of fucking stamina and then he hit me like with his elbow.
[486:02.94]Bro, hit me with his fucking elbow.
[486:04.87]Like, I was fine.
[486:07.71]Wrong vibe.
[486:10.01]Like, I don't know.
[486:10.97]He, like, he turned and... Can we get a priest for the res?
[486:38.14]Crouch into R1.
[486:43.12]What the hell is this move?
[486:46.21]What is this weird ass move?
[486:49.51]Yeah, that's what cheaters use.
[487:01.10]It's so good.
[487:05.19]Alright, for a second, I thought this was you.
[487:06.55]Yeah, they did nerf it at some point.
[487:10.21]The door, this fucking asshole piece of scum was blocking the door.
[487:16.57]I couldn't go through.
[487:17.21]Okay.
[487:26.68]Okay.
[487:28.91]The vibe was off.
[487:29.87]Make sure you rest for the debuff.
[487:32.51]The vibes are fine.
[487:33.34]It's just... I just lock in the door.
[487:41.77]Peter Griffin here.
[487:42.47]I wish you luck with the boss fight.
[487:44.45]Thanks, Peter.
[488:01.51]You forgot, um... Family Guy is sponsored in part by... That means you're not the real Peter Griffin.
[488:08.42]That's how I know.
[488:18.62]I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Let's give this one more try, and then... We're double bossing, and I have, like, a plus five weapon that I can't even equip correctly.
[488:27.43]It's plus four.
[488:29.78]We are double bossing right now.
[488:32.52]That's true.
[488:33.86]Vibe check.
[488:34.50]Vibe check.
[488:34.94]Don't get locked in the corner.
[488:35.84]Be careful.
[488:36.22]Vibe check.
[488:36.48]Hold on.
[488:36.88]Take your time.
[488:37.78]Run away from the lightning.
[488:39.52]I'm not quite sure about that vibe here right now.
[488:41.93]Let me see.
[488:42.35]Give me a minute.
[488:47.63]You're in the fight, though.
[488:48.83]Vibes are on.
[488:54.37]Already, vibes are off.
[488:58.26]Already.
[488:58.54]Already.
[489:12.14]I'm getting out of the corner.
[489:23.94]No.
[489:28.97]There's nowhere to go.
[489:29.67]You just die.
[489:31.67]The vibes were off that one.
[489:33.99]If you get hit by that fire, you just die.
[489:37.17]I got hit by it.
[489:38.69]How come I got up slower than you?
[489:46.21]The vibes were fucking terrible.
[489:48.03]Kill me!
[489:51.25]I walked into it.
[489:52.91]Dude, but I can't even see what this motherfucker is doing for a move.
[489:57.20]It's like...
[490:02.13]That's been this entire fight.
[490:03.49]All right.
[490:05.17]Relax, relax, relax.
[490:12.47]And vibes is just killing me right now.
[490:22.10]Kill me!
[490:25.26]How are you alive and you're trying to die?
[490:29.22]I was trying a bit.
[490:30.72]I thought it was funny.
[490:34.03]I just shook my whole room.
[490:38.35]All right.
[490:38.99]I am doing a Vito vibe stamp right now.
[490:44.12]Can we please do one where you don't die in like the first 10 seconds?
[490:46.76]No, the vibes are off.
[490:48.12]Okay.
[490:48.36]I legitimately think we have it.
[490:49.94]If you can just like, just here's what we're going to do.
[490:52.79]Here's the strat.
[490:53.27]We're going to run in.
[490:53.79]We're going to go up for the first 20 seconds of the boss fight.
[490:58.08]I don't want you to hit the boss more than one time and then just like walk away.
[491:01.60]Yeah, but I got the fucking strength.
[491:02.70]If you hit the boss twice in a row.
[491:03.76]Yeah.
[491:06.38]Like do like a jump attack.
[491:07.71]Did I like shrink?
[491:08.73]Why is this like so huge?
[491:39.72]I'm going to try that strategy.
[491:41.23]The crouch into swing.
[491:43.45]See if it works.
[491:47.75]So the the heavy poke.
[491:50.13]Yeah, like this thing.
[491:52.09]I wonder if it's behind you.
[491:53.28]He's dead.
[492:04.60]OK.
[492:06.87]Yeah, first playthrough.
[492:07.69]No spoilers please.
[492:08.51]Never seen this boss.
[492:27.11]What?
[492:55.50]its turning animation did like a full s worth of damage
[493:47.36]Okay, here we go.
[494:00.45]What the fuck is that bullshit?
[494:05.51]I was like so like, oh wow, what a clean dodge.
[494:08.55]Oh, totally.
[494:09.53]Boom, you're dead.
[494:10.89]Like a fucking hour later.
[494:12.07]We're going to beat this whole thing right now.
[494:15.29]Watch.
[494:29.60]Not even a fucking scratch.
[494:30.60]I'm fine.
[494:40.45]Okay.
[494:42.07]This is way too hard for what we have right now.
[494:45.29]Let's go.
[494:45.65]I think it'll be really funny.
[494:47.03]Let's like do like a catacombs.
[494:48.41]We're going to get to the end boss and it's going to be like, so just a guy named like Charles.
[494:54.69]We can feel good about that.
[494:55.49]I need you to rest.
[494:56.15]I'm like locked in the boss room.
[494:57.63]I need to get enough intelligence to use this weapon correctly or take the finger out of your inventory.
[495:04.95]I can't do that for you.
[495:06.10]I can't do it.
[495:06.96]I don't think I can do that.
[495:08.24]I need to take my finger out of your... You know what I mean?
[495:12.64]I need that.
[495:13.88]Plus seven.
[495:16.24]Yeah.
[495:17.34]Yeah, it is.
[495:18.33]It is.
[495:19.23]It is like a 30% probably damage increase.
[495:22.97]Definitely.
[495:23.23]You know what?
[495:25.30]um so let's go to let's go to one of the catacombs where's a good one something quick something easy I forget where they are we probably go to the artist shack and there's one around there I forget exactly where the starting I think there is one like down here like over here
[496:03.94]Hey, can you freak out?
[496:05.32]No.
[496:11.68]I could also just go to that Erd tree.
[496:15.34]Like anywhere.
[496:15.88]We can go anywhere and do anything.
[496:17.74]This whole wide open world is open to us.
[496:20.36]Somebody said, why do you get redder every time you die?
[496:23.30]I wonder why that is.
[496:24.78]Why would somebody get red?
[496:28.11]I just keep getting redder, apparently.
[496:32.26]Are you changing the hue on your camera?
[496:35.92]Okay.
[496:37.62]We're going to relax.
[496:39.56]Let's go do a dungeon, go clear a boss, go get me, you know, another few smithing stones and all that stuff, and we'll be good to go.
[496:49.19]Okay.
[496:49.79]Where exactly?
[496:52.01]I think there's one here, right?
[496:55.34]Like in the middle of the lake or like at the end of the lake.
[496:59.36]one here uh come this way and I also down there is the the first boater the mariner I think is right like right here I haven't been looking at the mod chat at all I'm sorry I don't know there's anything important in here
[497:27.03]lol yeah we realized I thought I did uh did you go down yeah is this the pat no there's like a big bear in this cave usually
[498:02.17]smith and stone seven I could probably actually upgrade my weapon quite a bit too like already with the stuff that I have I just need ruins and I just need um another somber stone I wish I could this whole thing just got so twisted up
[498:22.75]because I put 30 points in strength because I had a fucking meltdown I was so excited to get that and I just used it all and it was just it was really fun it was really exciting I mean it was very exciting a lot of people would have done the same right now this is up to Kayla dude I'm so lost I forget all the beginning like mini areas
[498:53.37]um there we could also go back to castle more and fight that boss we could probably kill it easily now what would come over here it was uh the deer where are you uh where are you and there's some water village there's a place to go down I think this is just a boss right in here just to oh yeah this is where the mariner would be
[499:22.34]And then I think there also is a basement.
[499:25.32]There's the gargoyle out here.
[499:28.48]I wish we could like ping.
[499:30.56]You're like... I see him.
[499:32.02]Okay, let's go get him.
[499:32.78]You want to fight the gargoyle?
[499:33.74]All right, let's go for it.
[499:37.03]It's dangerous.
[499:37.55]Get out of here.
[499:40.83]Tibia Kindred?
[499:56.10]Uh-oh.
[499:57.10]Ah, we have a bird.
[500:01.85]Oh my god, dude.
[500:05.27]Here's this fucking giant crow.
[500:09.61]I'm gonna pull the crow back here.
[500:11.53]You just focus on the boss.
[500:18.06]You don't, you dare kill me.
[500:20.04]Don't you dare kill me!
[500:26.46]Okay, he's dead.
[500:33.43]Am I playing co-op right now?
[500:35.07]I had, dude, one of those giant crows came over.
[500:36.95]That would have been the end of this whole run if I didn't kill that.
[501:02.57]Wow, he led the target.
[501:14.41]Why can't we just kill him?
[501:16.85]Okay.
[501:25.84]Okay.
[501:27.06]Now let's go down and see what's in there.
[501:34.31]Where is it?
[501:34.65]Over here, right?
[501:43.09]I forget.
[501:45.19]Random items.
[501:46.15]Yeah.
[501:46.46]I think it's over here.
[501:50.76]On the other side, I think.
[501:53.36]You forgot already?
[501:56.21]This whole place looks identical.
[501:58.20]The whole thing looks identical.
[502:08.40]Wow, you'd really diss the Elden Ring art team like that.
[502:13.83]And it's like a little sugar cube on the ground to go in.
[502:22.55]You thought it was coming.
[502:24.29]Getting cookbooks.
[502:30.15]Yeah, that was kind of not worth it.
[502:32.81]Well, it was content.
[502:35.37]Completed.
[502:36.07]Progress.
[502:37.43]I didn't want to even kill that deer, but I had to.
[502:45.32]Let's go all the way down Castle Moor.
[502:47.86]Yeah.
[502:55.19]I need a sacred tier yesterday.
[502:56.88]I really do.
[502:57.56]That would be like the number one best thing.
[503:00.70]Did you teleport?
[503:02.26]Casamorin, right?
[503:04.44]Beside the rampart goal all the way at the bottom.
[503:07.24]Oh, right, right, right.
[503:07.88]Yeah, people thought I was going to growl.
[503:12.30]That's why I did the I'm going to growl.
[503:25.64]Do you like beans and hot dogs?
[503:26.84]Yeah.
[503:28.42]That sounds amazing, dude.
[503:32.58]It actually is really good.
[503:33.38]Okay.
[503:35.44]I haven't had one in a while.
[503:36.70]I think I got something like that.
[503:42.53]This is going to kill me.
[503:43.11]Did you ever get that lasagna?
[503:44.03]You said you're going to get a lasagna earlier?
[503:47.17]No.
[503:52.77]Beans and hot dogs is great.
[503:56.00]Perfect.
[503:57.73]Alright, we should definitely be able to do this now.
[504:26.80]really you're being quinge don't do it oh he responds here or not uh-oh uh is that actual I think he's gonna actual spawn is he gonna suck them all up or what no all right he sucked them all up
[504:55.09]Did they respawn?
[504:55.91]I don't think so, right?
[504:57.56]They might have a move that spawns them.
[505:01.50]Yeah, they spawned again.
[505:02.70]I thought you died right there.
[505:20.51]I was like, oh shit.
[505:29.23]Oh my goodness, where's the edge?
[505:35.03]Will he stop doing this move?
[505:42.64]Oh my god, it's hurting us!
[505:50.77]Yeah, it also sucks you.
[506:04.22]Alright, that's it.
[506:06.44]What?
[506:06.98]We didn't kill him.
[506:09.42]What is he doing?
[506:10.20]Okay.
[506:12.12]We're good.
[506:17.30]Memory stone and a golden seed.
[506:19.06]I got a sacred tear.
[506:19.98]Thank goodness.
[506:22.34]Jealous.
[506:23.00]I'm jealous.
[506:23.60]Hey, I'm leaving the stream open because I'm going to bed, but please don't scream or growl or anything.
[506:31.27]I'm not going to.
[506:33.42]I was just earlier, I was just joking around about it.
[506:38.83]OK, that's good.
[506:39.83]Can we go back to Blacksmith so I can upgrade?
[506:47.95]Because I think I need, do I have the amount of stones I need?
[506:52.51]You were missing a five.
[506:54.59]Yeah, no, I needed five still.
[506:59.36]I wonder if anybody sells them.
[507:01.28]Left side of this island we haven't even gone to.
[507:03.96]I know there's a bunch of catacombs, Erdtree, and all that shit out there.
[507:07.05]It's just always annoying because there's like one bridge.
[507:09.81]We could go up to Castlemore and Rampart and go west.
[507:13.33]We haven't done any of the Erdtrees.
[507:25.72]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[507:27.30]Yeah.
[507:27.78]So there's a lot of shit we haven't done.
[507:30.24]Instead, we're in fucking Ray Lucario fighting Placidusax.
[507:33.40]Let's do the archery over here.
[507:34.80]Let's do what you said.
[507:42.33]And then how are you feeling?
[507:43.31]Are you all right?
[507:44.49]I feel like we should probably eat food.
[507:45.81]Honestly, I was up until 5 a.m.
[507:48.57]last night.
[507:49.70]So like I'm I'm a little bit goofed.
[507:52.76]Um.
[507:55.92]I do I do have to however wake up and go to the gym tomorrow um but like who cares am I right I mean am I right we can always just like I don't know take a day take a day or two and come back on like monday or tuesday or something I thought we were gonna play tomorrow yeah but if it's like you're up too late and you want to go to the gym and stuff
[508:21.13]I have to go early no matter what.
[508:22.81]It's not a whole thing.
[508:24.81]Okay.
[508:29.93]I rescheduled the gymming already.
[508:39.36]I definitely want to eat food, though.
[508:41.64]Let's do a boss or two.
[508:44.04]I don't know.
[508:44.94]Set a milestone and then we'll stop and we can play tomorrow.
[508:47.84]Let's fight a boss.
[508:49.46]Get some...
[508:51.55]you know, ruins.
[508:52.53]Because it has been eight and a half hours and I'm hungry.
[508:56.39]This is the demigod.
[508:58.33]I don't know if you count that.
[508:59.81]Does this count?
[509:00.69]Yeah.
[509:02.48]This counts.
[509:03.76]Okay.
[509:14.73]What time do you want to start tomorrow?
[509:21.16]I don't think this counts.
[509:23.12]Are you sure?
[509:23.66]It's kind of like five bosses in here.
[509:25.32]I don't know, man.
[509:30.77]Actually, I guess because bosses can... I was thinking that it would be an actual A boss, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a boss.
[509:37.97]It's the bear.
[509:38.73]Yeah, the rune bear is a boss.
[509:42.60]Is it?
[509:43.38]I think the rune bear is technically a boss, right?
[509:47.68]I don't think so.
[509:51.43]I'm a human.
[509:51.87]I'm playing with you.
[509:54.25]I was trying to hit you.
[510:00.01]Okay.
[510:01.55]What's the deal?
[510:03.71]A little weirdo following you.
[510:07.67]Pop's barrier.
[510:09.26]Thanks, Pop.
[510:15.72]This one doesn't count.
[510:16.74]All right, fine.
[510:18.32]There's not even a fog gate.
[510:25.34]Like, is patchwork a boss?
[510:28.26]Does that count?
[510:31.69]I mean... No.
[510:36.01]Isn't there a way to go down here, though?
[510:40.89]Yeah.
[510:41.67]No, there's, like, a chest, but it's in a weird, like, hidden spot.
[510:46.59]There's actually... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[510:49.06]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[510:50.84]There's, like... We're surrounded by caves right now.
[510:52.92]There's, like, a lot we can do.
[510:57.17]not there's a cave up here what time zones uh pacific yeah it's probably really late for a lot of you guys probably really late for you what time is it for you it's late for you isn't it um holy it's late that's what that's what I'm saying that's what I've been trying to say dude
[511:26.26]You want to just pull the plug now and just come back tomorrow?
[511:28.16]There's a cave around here, dude.
[511:29.78]I know it.
[511:30.82]You're going to miss your gym appointment.
[511:33.82]I'm not.
[511:34.24]I was going to be up late anyway.
[511:36.48]Okay.
[511:38.16]When you get up really groggy tomorrow and you don't get a good pump on, you're going to remember... That's fine.
[511:44.80]I wasn't going to get a good one anyway.
[511:50.67]Why not?
[511:55.97]I don't know.
[511:56.63]I have to fight a boss, dude.
[511:59.93]Where the hell are the caves around here?
[512:02.78]I mean, it's hard to look at the map because we can't.
[512:05.08]Let's jump up the air beam.
[512:08.28]The air pilot.
[512:09.70]Jump up.

[516:08.39]All the way in that one corner?
[516:12.86]He's in the volcano.
[516:15.74]I can't imagine the volcano spinning around like that.

[517:30.05]Letter to Patches and Ronin's armor.
[517:35.23]OK, let's teleport back to the church.
[517:37.11]I want to see one thing and then it's done.
[517:40.17]The church?
[517:41.69]Yeah, we just came from Church of Pilgrimage right above us.
[517:48.77]All right.
[517:50.14]So we'll do, what, 1 o'clock?
[517:52.68]2 o'clock tomorrow, Pacific?
[517:54.44]1 or 2.
[517:54.84]I'll be around.
[517:55.42]Just message me.
[517:55.93]I don't know if you want to make, like, a solid schedule so people know, but, like... Well, we're not going to run into the technical bullshit, so let's start at 1.
[518:03.99]Okay, I will be back probably by... Let me think.
[518:09.78]I'll be back 2 hours before that, so that's fine.
[518:16.96]Yeah, I, um...
[518:19.38]Yeah, we start at one that we can, it won't be too late if we go a long time.
[518:26.29]Cool.
[518:27.67]Cool.
[518:30.23]I forgot how you use the cookbooks was the thing I wanted to look at.
[518:34.01]I thought you did that at a resting site.
[518:36.82]I think you just have them now.
[518:39.04]Because it's crafting shit.
[518:41.08]So we never got the crafting thing to do any crafting.
[518:44.28]Oh, yeah, you need an item to craft.
[518:46.16]Yeah.
[518:47.14]Okay, well, yeah, because I think the crafting things that you craft are also randomized.
[518:51.40]You'd like spend a whole bunch of weird stuff to get weird thing.
[518:57.70]And I've got a lot of weird stuff.
[518:59.24]Anyway, yeah, that was good.
[519:00.73]Good fun.
[519:01.31]Good night.
[519:02.29]I think we'll, I mean, I don't know if we'll beat it tomorrow, but I think we'll probably get the least past regular Karya and it through.
[519:11.93]We've made some pretty good progress.
[519:12.93]Look at how long.
[519:13.89]Look at this.
[519:15.61]We did pretty good.
[519:17.66]I banish you.
[519:18.22]Yeah, we'll start at one.
[519:26.67]The hardest part is always in Elden Ring, like gearing up in the beginning.
[519:31.19]Well, I mean, randomizer doesn't make it any easier.
[519:33.09]Yeah, I mean, there's like the tricks you could do.
[519:35.55]We go kill the giant dragon and you know, wow, I got all their souls and everyone like claps.
[519:41.59]Yeah, I'd rather just suck absolute asshole at the game and mess up two or three builds in a row.
[519:48.67]I think it's more fun that way.
[519:51.90]That's what I'm saying.
[519:52.68]Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.
[519:54.62]See you tomorrow.
[519:55.88]Bye, Ster.
[519:57.30]Bye.
[520:00.20]And goodbye to all of you.
[520:01.59]Kind of a meaty one today.
[520:04.53]I don't know if we're going to do...
[520:09.78]I can't tell you this is going to be a nine-hour stream tomorrow, but we'll play it.
[520:13.60]We'll go for a little while.
[520:15.70]As long as we can.
[520:18.02]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[520:18.90]We'll see you tomorrow.
[520:19.81]I'm very, very hungry and I'm very tired.
[520:21.77]I'm kind of zonked out right now.
[520:28.03]But that was a lot of fun.
[520:30.77]I was scared that it wasn't going to work that well.
[520:34.92]But it actually works very, very well.
[520:44.51]Appreciate you hanging out very, very late for a lot of you.
[520:52.08]I am going to eat food and go right to bed.
[521:02.43]First order of business tomorrow when the stream starts is I have to do I need to find a smithing stone 5 and I gotta put points into intelligence.
[521:13.54]That's what we're doing.
[521:21.36]He needed a typing test.
[521:23.00]Oh, that's right.
[521:23.72]I'll bring it up tomorrow, too.
[521:29.67]Elden Ring's always a blast, even though it's kind of a frustrating mess sometimes, but it's always fun.
[521:36.37]There was two or three potential growl attempts, and I stopped them.
[521:40.25]And you saw my face.
[521:40.95]I looked over, and I put a stop to it.
[521:50.10]Nah, I'll see you tomorrow.
[521:52.72]Good night, everybody.
[521:56.19]Take care of yourselves.
[521:56.79]Drink a lot.
[521:58.33]I can't even talk.
[521:59.41]Just a glass of water.
[522:03.78]Call your mother.
[522:04.24]You know the deal.
[522:06.82]See you guys later.
[522:48.24]So,
[523:23.12]you
