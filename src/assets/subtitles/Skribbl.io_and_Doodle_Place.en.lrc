[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.43]God damn it.
[00:02.17]I went downstairs.
[00:05.97]And when I came back up, my Scriblio link expired.
[00:12.28]So I wrote a bunch of names.
[00:14.78]I wrote a bunch of custom things to scribble.
[00:19.84]And the gah.
[00:20.91]It's alright.
[00:21.41]Yeah, hold on.
[00:22.85]I got the quickest hands in the West.
[00:26.55]Okay.
[00:31.88]Alright, yeah, okay.
[00:33.22]Wait, oh, people don't even know what the fuck is going on.
[00:35.66]Uh, hi, first of all.
[00:37.76]How are you?
[00:39.30]Today, uh, yeah, I just started the stream as if everybody knew what we were doing.
[00:45.64]Oh, my link expired.
[00:47.58]What link?
[00:48.02]Jeremy, what are you talking about?
[00:52.42]Well, the next couple days, including today, are going to be
[01:01.03]Uh, chill short streams.
[01:04.45]It's getting down to the last seven days or so.
[01:07.57]Six days before the carnival.
[01:10.51]And I really, really, really... I gotta put... Essentially, that's where all my brain is right now.
[01:16.73]I'm having meetings every day over the phone.
[01:22.75]That is where my brain is at the moment.
[01:25.39]So, as of today, I can't really focus on...
[01:30.36]stream-related stuff, so we're just gonna hang out.
[01:32.90]Tomorrow, though, is the activity book stream.
[01:37.10]We're going to go through a bunch of the cool shit that you guys have done.
[01:43.52]That's also gonna be only probably a few hours.
[01:47.31]Because once I'm done with this stream, boom, I'm out of here.
[01:51.27]I'm literally gonna go and do a bunch of other shit.
[01:54.54]Tomorrow, the second that stream is over.
[01:57.24]See ya.
[01:58.18]I'm out.
[01:59.10]I'm gonna do a bunch of shit for that stream on the 21st.
[02:04.17]So, the next couple days, we're just gonna hang out.
[02:06.09]Maybe this stream will be a few hours.
[02:07.93]Maybe.
[02:08.55]Depends.
[02:10.27]But don't expect the next couple streams to be more than, like, six, seven, eight hours like they are sometimes.
[02:17.21]But, what we're doing today, we're just gonna hang out.
[02:19.83]We are going to do something that has been incredibly highly requested.
[02:24.01]By everybody.
[02:25.33]And I mean every single person has requested this at least one time.
[02:30.03]It's to play Scribbleo.
[02:33.99]With your friends.
[02:38.87]And who better than you guys, you know?
[02:43.70]Who?
[02:44.12]You did.
[02:44.58]I did.
[02:45.02]Yes, you did.
[02:46.10]I have a... Look, the only way I said I was going to do this is if I looked up a log, and if every single person that's ever come into this room, into the chat room, at least once did they say, please play Scribbleo, is the only way I was going to do it, and they did.
[03:04.15]So how this is going to work is the sub Discord is currently open.
[03:09.23]I have an invite link.
[03:10.97]I'm just going to send it in there.
[03:12.27]It's going to be a sub only thing.
[03:15.23]Because you know how player people are.
[03:20.34]Speaking of subs, five of you just may have gotten a chance to do it.
[03:25.78]Whoever the five of you.
[03:27.76]Get in that Discord right now.
[03:28.92]It might be you.
[03:31.09]What the fuck is this?
[03:31.83]Don't link gifts in here.
[03:36.24]That was Bakken.
[03:38.22]Five community subs.
[03:38.96]Thank you, Bakken.
[03:41.68]And I didn't even tweet anything.
[03:43.68]I've been so scattered.
[03:47.58]I'm so fucking, like, lit right now.
[03:51.69]Yes, I did say that.
[03:53.42]I have a coach now.
[03:54.38]I have a Twitch coach.
[03:58.10]Told me to use the word lit more often.
[03:59.88]Told me to use the word epic more often.
[04:02.26]And I'm going to see if it works.
[04:03.91]He guaranteed me 5-10% more viewership if I did that.
[04:07.45]Alright, let me just make a tweet.
[04:13.37]I'll be right back.
[04:42.78]Does chilling out with a crayon in my hand make sense for this stream?
[04:48.74]I don't think it does.
[04:52.40]How about... Because it's a drawing.
[04:59.07]There's another drawing game that I'm doing after this too.
[05:01.67]I fucking don't know.
[05:06.77]I never know what to write here.
[05:09.76]This is... I'm gonna give you guys the bane of a streamer or YouTuber's existence.
[05:15.04]This is like creating a new character every day.
[05:18.38]In a game.
[05:18.88]I don't know what this guy's name's gonna be.
[05:21.48]I don't know what this stream's attributes are at the moment.
[05:31.58]Uh, AdventureMFDan, thanks for the five subs.
[05:33.20]I'm just gonna write drawing and...
[05:38.80]Drawing and... and climb.
[05:42.37]No, that makes no... Drawing and... That's it.
[05:45.81]Drawing in.
[05:49.59]Because I don't know what the end is.
[05:56.99]Done?
[05:57.39]Okay.
[05:58.65]Drawing in.
[06:00.68]Alright, the link is about to go into the sub-Discord.
[06:05.04]I suggest you go fast.
[06:08.08]Because it ain't going to be there for very long.
[06:10.06]And people right now are doing something they're not supposed to be doing in this channel.
[06:13.36]They're spamming.
[06:15.30]And they're going to get in trouble.
[06:20.37]I've got all your names.
[06:24.43]I'm waiting for it to settle down in here.
[06:27.25]That's right.
[06:27.61]Yeah, do the monk ass.
[06:29.09]You're not supposed to be spamming in this channel.
[06:35.63]Here it comes.
[06:36.85]I'm only doing this once.
[06:38.75]So, blame your fellow sub-Discord member.
[06:41.43]Okay.
[06:59.61]So, I think... Does that mean that it's all been dumped in here?
[07:02.89]Is that what that means?
[07:10.26]Oh shit!
[07:10.90]You're not supposed to look at that!
[07:15.82]You guys weren't supposed to see the words, the custom words.
[07:24.97]Alright, I guess we're going.
[07:30.09]Oh, by the way, what's like my absolute kill switch here?
[07:33.60]How do I like ban somebody?
[07:36.22]It's my turn?
[07:37.62]No, Bruce is drawing.
[07:39.14]Wait, but I do, I don't know all the words.
[07:43.23]It's all that you just guess.
[07:49.33]How many times can I guess?
[07:50.31]How often can, oh, wait.
[07:51.35]I don't know, it's two words.
[07:59.74]Tie?
[08:02.56]Bow tie.
[08:05.70]Is that a shirt?
[08:07.44]Is that a cross?
[08:09.70]What?
[08:11.28]Priest?
[08:17.10]Uh, shirt?
[08:23.77]There's a V in there.
[08:28.69]V-neck?
[08:30.83]Is there a switch?
[08:31.59]There's a switch on the shirt.
[08:34.66]Vertical shirt.
[08:37.05]TV shirt.
[08:42.33]Steve Jobs?
[08:49.09]What?
[08:51.75]What?
[08:55.61]Was it an iPhone?
[08:58.59]Circle.
[08:59.15]Got it.
[09:01.17]Wait, people can just watch the stream.
[09:06.46]Blueberry.
[09:14.15]It's not Earth?
[09:19.89]Um... E. We're... World... Grass?
[09:37.22]Globe?
[09:38.10]Oh, shit.
[09:40.45]Globe, of course.
[09:50.99]Carrot.
[09:57.29]Anytime you see two orange lines connecting for a triangle upside down, it's a carrot, no matter what.
[10:10.66]What is this?
[10:14.72]What is that?
[10:18.78]That's so funny.
[10:22.02]Carrot man.
[10:29.62]Get a lot of time to draw on this one.
[10:31.92]In this game.
[10:35.90]Bed.
[10:37.14]Bunk bed.
[10:46.18]Is it a flag?
[10:50.08]Is it a United States flag?
[11:01.06]What is that?
[11:11.41]Forehead.
[11:15.04]No, I... No, I don't... North... Canada?
[11:24.96]Is it Canada?
[11:27.97]Oh.
[11:33.65]Help me.
[11:35.11]North?
[11:36.03]Oh, okay.
[11:36.93]I thought that said forehead or something at first.
[11:41.89]North Canada!
[11:47.22]Kick Jerma.
[11:48.24]I didn't do anything.
[11:55.27]Book?
[11:59.27]How the fuck would you get this?
[12:01.23]It's a rectangle.
[12:03.41]It's an iPhone.
[12:06.99]It's an iPad.
[12:08.71]It's a surface.
[12:11.99]That's a surface.
[12:18.45]Oh, it's a tablet.
[12:26.09]It's a tab- Well, I got it right.
[12:27.42]It should be like Family Feud.
[12:28.44]If I say iPad, it should be like, you got it.
[12:36.88]I didn't make these words, guys.
[12:38.58]Like, Steve Jobs, Apple, tablets, not me.
[12:44.58]How would you get that?
[12:45.96]That quickly?
[12:46.86]Glove?
[12:50.59]That's like a self-park hand.
[13:01.98]That's a minion.
[13:02.99]A minion.
[13:08.99]That's actually pretty good.
[13:20.87]Branch.
[13:21.41]Tree.
[13:23.69]Log.
[13:24.53]Map.
[13:25.91]Country.
[13:27.35]Person's face.
[13:27.95]That's like, it's a nose and this is the mouth right here.
[13:34.60]A monster or something?
[13:36.42]I don't know.
[13:45.55]Is it a beard?
[13:54.64]Wait a minute.
[13:59.58]It was, you know what gave it away?
[14:01.72]You know what gave it away for me?
[14:02.68]The gray.
[14:06.16]This right here.
[14:06.86]What?
[14:30.18]A street lamp or something?
[14:36.65]A firework.
[14:41.55]That's a nice touch.
[14:51.10]That was a nice touch, it was.
[14:54.12]I want to draw.
[14:56.70]Don't listen.
[14:57.45]Don't say your answer.
[14:58.45]I'm not going to type the answer.
[15:00.73]It doesn't matter.
[15:01.29]I put a sensor bar over the text box.
[15:11.88]Alright, I'll do that next round.
[15:15.50]At a bed?
[15:24.89]Lying in bed.
[15:28.77]Uh, teacher.
[15:29.43]Let's choose a chalkboard.
[15:41.02]It's just the first part.
[15:48.70]That's actually, I like this.
[15:50.70]This.
[15:52.02]You didn't write the word chalk.
[15:54.71]That was pretty good.
[15:59.78]Oh, Otto's choosing a word.
[16:00.97]I wonder what it's gonna be.
[16:20.01]Uhh...
[16:31.88]Alright.
[16:32.18]Alright.
[16:32.48]Alright.
[16:32.72]I got it.
[16:33.02]I got it.
[16:33.34]I got it.
[16:33.62]I got it.
[16:46.33]Boomer Prince.
[16:47.97]Boomer Princess.
[16:50.43]Oh.
[16:52.59]Boomer Princess means queen.
[17:04.46]You guys don't make any sense with the boomer shit.
[17:07.09]That just is somebody that happens to be older than you.
[17:10.69]Is a boomer.
[17:12.05]What if you're like 40 and the person above you is 41?
[17:16.10]Are they a boomer and you're not?
[17:32.41]I don't fucking... How the fuck do you spell alcohol?
[17:52.41]Ooh!
[18:02.10]No, everyone's gonna guess.
[18:03.54]Why did I- No, I gotta turn- Oh.
[18:07.26]Yeah, good luck.
[18:07.84]Oh, fucking whatever.
[18:25.93]I'm still gonna do it.
[18:55.31]I have to like censor this shit.
[18:57.97]Otherwise like I may as well just be watching chat play this game.
[19:01.26]Is that what we're doing today?
[19:03.00]For like the couple hours that I'm gonna be here?
[19:10.05]You guys just play this game together.
[19:21.03]Cover the top part.
[19:22.57]Yeah, yeah.
[19:23.78]Hold on.
[19:25.00]I gotta at least stay in the game here.
[19:33.24]Bolt.
[19:36.44]Damn it.
[19:38.53]Uh... Alright, I'm gonna... Let me do this.
[19:43.51]I need to make some sensors here.
[19:44.65]Okay, background color.
[20:00.36]Alright.
[20:03.87]No, what the fuck is going on?
[20:05.30]Wait, I gotta guess this.
[20:08.24]Person.
[20:10.08]Kid.
[20:12.16]Man.
[20:15.72]Guy.
[20:27.19]I'm the first fucking one to get it, and now everyone's gonna be...
[20:34.74]Should have had that shit ready to go.
[20:35.87]Oh well.
[20:41.47]How do you...
[21:05.62]No, that looks horrible.
[21:06.70]I'm just gonna make it, just make it black.
[21:09.28]Blocked.
[21:09.92]That just looks like my computer's broken.
[21:12.58]This is like grandma has a bunch of viruses.
[21:26.28]Trying to do like this.
[21:27.08]Are you trying to do this?
[21:28.72]I gotta do this side too.
[21:29.84]How do I turn that off?
[21:30.94]Because people can still see that.
[21:36.06]How is that not the sun?
[21:44.42]Just zoom it in?
[21:45.28]Yeah, but it's still going to bleed into the side here.
[21:51.46]H?
[22:00.22]Hold on.
[22:24.80]There we go.
[22:36.38]What is that?
[22:46.96]Wait a minute, wait a minute!
[22:51.63]What?
[22:52.23]How do I spell it?
[22:55.67]Got it.
[22:56.99]That's actually a really good, that's a good one.
[23:00.43]I knew what that was just from the shape of the face.
[23:02.58]Good work.
[23:07.86]That was Fred Flintstone.
[23:08.90]Is it my turn?
[23:10.66]No.
[23:10.82]No.
[23:21.18]Alright.
[23:26.00]See, I can't talk, though.
[23:27.44]Mmm, ladder.
[23:28.83]Mmm, bed.
[23:29.75]Lodge bed.
[23:30.53]Bunk bed.
[23:31.05]It's bunk bed.
[23:31.59]It's bunk bed.
[23:32.73]It's my... I got it before.
[23:33.95]But I can't talk.
[23:36.23]I just can't speak.
[23:45.71]Because every time I talk, I give a hint.
[23:55.63]Just mute yourself.
[24:03.02]The next time, the words aren't even going to matter, because I'm going to do only custom words.
[24:07.50]Good luck.
[24:12.74]You can mute the other players.
[24:20.65]Hi?
[24:21.53]Hello?
[24:24.89]Hello?
[24:33.04]Once you point to something, it's like, that's it.
[24:35.40]Game over.
[24:42.36]Now let's toggle audio.
[24:54.86]Nope.
[25:00.33]Just put a face cam over there.
[25:01.49]I can't do face cam today.
[25:08.53]um uh basket a uh what the fuck is that how did I not get this I don't know was it a candle
[25:37.90]Oh.
[25:38.94]Right.
[25:44.14]It's a glue.
[25:48.61]Unblock the words at the top?
[25:49.95]I can't.
[25:50.31]That's cheating for them.
[25:52.13]And I don't want to come in last place just because I'm the one that has the screen up.
[25:57.35]I will get that.
[25:58.09]Okay, that really does look horrible though.
[26:12.34]That's just, it just don't look good at all.
[26:31.49]It's fireman.
[26:34.97]There's one of the custom ones, good, nice work.
[26:47.40]Alright, what's this one?
[27:03.44]What is this?
[27:07.41]That's what it is.
[27:15.70]Everybody got the word.
[27:16.76]Hey, good.
[27:17.50]That's good.
[27:19.54]Just block where you type.
[27:22.10]Well, you'll be able to see what everyone else is writing.
[27:24.68]I don't want anyone to come close.
[27:36.69]Yeah, but that lets people write, oh, why are you blocking the answers?
[27:43.38]I've seen this like 15 times already.
[27:46.16]You understand?
[28:01.23]Everyone's screen looks like yours.
[28:02.61]I'm talking about your screen and my screen.
[28:05.91]I've seen Pee Pee Poo Poo like seven times.
[28:24.85]You guys are distracting me.
[28:34.93]Fuck.
[28:36.49]Did I get it?
[28:37.09]I don't know if I did it fast enough.
[28:40.19]I don't think I did it fast enough.
[28:44.65]It was like a one frame, I think.
[28:47.47]It doesn't matter.
[28:47.99]Okay, we're good.
[28:54.22]No, it don't matter.
[28:55.12]Nah, it doesn't fucking matter.
[29:00.90]I didn't look.
[29:01.44]Alright, for the people that didn't look, I'm doing it.
[29:19.66]I didn't have very much time.
[29:39.33]Why are you thumbing me down?
[29:41.89]Yeah, you would.
[29:46.31]And you want to tell me why are you blocking this?
[29:53.27]Yeah.
[29:54.53]You should only be blocking the chat window for you.
[29:59.57]Heaven forbid somebody writes everyone right forehead and I look over here and that's all I see.
[30:04.03]Uh, village.
[30:10.83]Got it.
[30:11.42]At the last fucking second.
[30:31.37]How about... What?
[30:51.12]What?
[30:51.80]It's not... What?
[31:20.91]Ow.
[31:26.35]That's pretty good.
[31:30.53]Incognito.
[31:43.24]I'm too innocent to know.
[31:51.86]Yeah, but incognito... Guys, I... You don't need incognito when you live alone, okay?
[32:08.98]What is this?
[32:23.40]I think, is this like the zoo?
[32:26.38]Is it a giraffe?
[32:31.91]A t-shirt.
[32:39.19]What is that?
[32:41.40]It's supposed to be a zebra.
[32:47.76]This is great.
[32:50.47]Um... I don't... It's a movie?
[33:00.20]Madagascar.
[33:07.24]Ah, that was... That was... That was adorable.
[33:10.62]That was awesome.
[33:27.33]Hell... hell... What?
[33:32.05]Hello?
[33:44.01]You're not gonna write the whole fucking thing, are you?
[33:55.02]No.
[34:00.45]Uh, yes, that was... That was Minecraft.
[34:06.26]All you had to do was write, hello ladies and gentlemen.
[34:10.04]And everybody in this room.
[34:12.11]Or at least most of them.
[34:16.19]Alright, my turn's coming up soon, right?
[34:34.38]I knew it immediately.
[34:38.31]It was the shape of the hat.
[34:45.11]We just got five community subs coming in from JermaSucks.
[34:50.41]Thank you, JermaSucks, for the five subs.
[34:56.15]Appreciate that.
[34:56.78]Thank you.
[35:11.84]can make a fire with how fast I'm doing that.
[35:23.66]Pretty good.
[35:26.10]Pretty good.
[35:27.89]Mm-hmm.
[35:30.53]This is nice.
[35:31.89]This is relaxing.
[35:34.67]I need this.
[35:35.17]You know what I mean?
[35:35.75]I needed this right now.
[35:45.61]Alright, we got a guy.
[35:50.89]T. Is that a T?
[35:52.43]Is that supposed to be T pose?
[35:56.95]Why is this person huge?
[36:01.09]Uh... Are they playing, like, poker?
[36:13.28]Food.
[36:16.93]A catering service?
[36:23.96]I have no fucking idea.
[36:27.00]Restaurant.
[36:29.22]I thought it was something to do with how big this guy was.
[36:46.07]Jerma, Jerma, that's the, you just, you, that's the, you're not doing the American way to spell gray.
[36:55.98]What is, um.
[37:03.94]Yep.
[37:04.68]Good.
[37:05.08]Got it.
[37:13.97]That is the god of all gods of lightning.
[37:20.57]Zeus.
[37:23.03]Zeus.
[37:24.09]Zeus.
[37:26.05]Zeus.
[37:27.31]That was a good one.
[37:28.21]You can cap that one if you want to use it for whatever you want.
[37:30.54]It's completely royalty free, by the way.
[37:32.02]That's royalty free.
[37:33.70]You can use that anywhere.
[37:43.16]Why would you already just guess it?
[37:44.42]This person just guessed McDonald's immediately.
[37:46.38]Like, come on.
[37:50.36]Don't be that guy on Win, Lose, or Draw that hits the buzzer and just yells out a word.
[37:54.83]And then they have to, like, pause the show.
[38:00.71]Ooh.
[38:02.67]It was tricky.
[38:08.14]Um...
[38:22.84]Well, what threw me off on this one was it wasn't a soda.
[38:26.88]It was a hard apple cider, from what I remember.
[38:45.16]Is the keyboard.
[38:47.08]Mega space bar.
[38:48.54]Sometimes I wish I had a mega space bar.
[38:54.25]If there was a giant space bar, that should be pretty cool.
[39:01.21]Why?
[39:01.49]Because it would be like... I would love just a button right here, like a big one.
[39:09.59]Right underneath the space bar.
[39:10.79]You know what?
[39:11.31]I wish there was a second space bar.
[39:13.17]Hold on a second here.
[39:16.64]This is my idea.
[39:18.08]Whoever does this later on down the road, if you're a company, I want 5% of all sales because that's bullshit.
[39:23.68]You know where you got it from.
[39:25.18]I want a space bar under the space bar.
[39:26.72]Two space bars.
[39:31.29]Two of them.
[39:31.95]One, two.
[39:32.95]You know how awesome it would be to map something to the second space bar that's right underneath?
[39:38.05]I'm talking, we're talking crouches, jumps, slides.
[39:45.18]Even if you put a button underneath alt.
[39:48.32]So I'm talking, we're talking either between alt and spacebar have like one little long, little log here.
[39:55.85]So you can just be like bang bang on alt.
[40:00.13]No, no, not a split spacebar.
[40:01.65]Yuck.
[40:02.76]That's... You just made me almost fucking throw up when you said that.
[40:07.72]Wait, it's my turn.
[40:10.32]No, it's not.
[40:12.22]I'm talking spacebar, spacebar.
[40:17.44]Cover my- I'm gonna cover- I know, I know, I know.
[40:18.86]Alright, I'm covering.
[40:36.66]Uh, the answer was Fortress, by the way.
[40:42.90]Pretty good way to get Fortress.
[40:44.76]Alright, it's my turn.
[40:45.76]Nobody can see.
[40:47.28]Perfect.
[40:49.42]Ooh, okay.
[40:51.14]These are all awful.
[41:07.22]That's it.
[41:09.10]That's it.
[41:09.46]That's all you, that's it.
[41:10.32]That's it.
[41:10.82]It's, that's it.
[41:11.56]That is it.
[41:20.22]There's no other good way to do that.
[41:50.94]I was trying to write bus stop.
[41:55.12]It was bench.
[41:55.82]Yes.
[42:03.35]Hey!
[42:03.53]There it is.
[42:05.09]Game over.
[42:05.95]I lose.
[42:07.71]Thank you everybody for playing.
[42:10.79]None of these come up.
[42:24.44]What's Jerma Odin?
[42:25.88]I don't know.
[42:26.46]I was going to see what they thought it was.
[42:27.74]Alright, I'm going to do custom words exclusively.
[42:35.32]I'm going to make a new room and a new link, by the way.
[42:37.08]Yeah, I leaked the invite.
[42:40.83]I'm making a new room.
[42:46.47]So, I'm going to do exclusively custom words.
[42:51.43]Chat.
[42:54.06]What do you mean I leaked the room?
[42:56.87]What am I talking about?
[42:58.99]I'm making a new lobby.
[43:01.55]Okay.
[43:03.49]I would like it if you guys could just write fucking anything you want in this chat.
[43:06.92]Random words that I'm going to put in here.
[43:13.06]I'm just going to start typing.
[43:29.95]I'm not putting that in.
[43:41.23]Alright, quit, stop joining the lobby.
[43:57.73]Okay.
[44:08.78]Okay.
[44:12.14]I can't believe I just fucking wrote that, but alright.
[44:31.24]This is gonna be fucking terrible.
[44:36.79]It has to be one word, guys.
[44:38.49]Okay.
[44:54.34]Alright, a couple more and then we'll be good.
[45:18.76]Alright, that's it.
[45:27.39]This is more of just an experiment from me.
[45:30.63]Because these are... I... How the fuck are you going to draw half of these?
[45:42.56]Alright, let's go.
[45:45.16]I'm going to put into the sub Discord right now.
[45:50.88]That's right.
[45:51.72]That's right.
[45:52.34]Here it comes.
[45:52.80]You better stop spamming.
[45:58.48]How the fuck did somebody get in here as impossible?
[46:04.09]No, nevermind.
[46:04.41]We're good.
[46:04.65]Alright.
[46:05.63]So here it comes.
[46:12.57]Are you ready?
[46:15.84]By the way, if you don't behave and play by the rules, I will permanently ban you from the website.
[46:20.80]Okay?
[46:21.24]Good.
[46:21.80]Sounds good.
[46:25.94]Three, two, one.
[46:27.02]Go ahead and come in.
[46:36.43]Okay.
[46:39.55]I'm about to start the game.
[46:41.85]Everything's in the right place.
[46:42.71]We're using custom words exclusively.
[46:47.86]Here we go.
[46:56.61]Round one.
[46:58.75]Good luck and have fun.
[47:02.97]Don't get yourself permanently banned from the website, please.
[47:19.34]I made these.
[47:21.12]So why wouldn't I know?
[47:23.00]I made all these.
[47:25.68]If I don't come in at least second or fourth, if I don't come between two and five, then like I may as well just never play a game like this again.
[47:33.63]I know all the words, all of them.
[47:41.99]But, I mean, I don't know what they... I have no idea because it's very possible that people were going to draw something that is not... Is there no sound?
[47:50.24]Oh, shit.
[47:50.76]Sorry.
[47:58.17]I want to see how people do this, though.
[48:03.65]Otto.
[48:03.85]Otto.
[48:20.46]The thing is, I kinda- I don't think- I don't remember the words I put in.
[48:28.02]How are people getting this already?
[48:31.41]What?
[48:42.27]It's the chin.
[48:43.41]Damn, I didn't think you guys were gonna get that that fast.
[48:57.41]I'm giving everybody a head start.
[48:59.29]It's coffee.
[49:01.75]I just said it, whatever.
[49:03.13]Wait, it's gonna be my turn to draw here in a little bit.
[49:09.82]No, not at all.
[49:16.40]Don't lose.
[49:17.06]I'm gonna lose because of what?
[49:18.48]I'm just gonna win every round by just typing in the words I know I wrote down?
[49:23.22]That would be a bad idea.
[49:25.66]I want to see how people draw and if people can get it.
[49:35.73]This is just one of the, this is a random word that I just wrote from chat, that's it.
[49:40.82]This is not like a stream reference.
[49:53.86]It's just a bulldozer.
[49:55.30]That's it.
[49:56.52]I just somebody said bulldozer, and I was like, alright, that's actually kind of hard to draw, I guess.
[50:11.47]Alright, what do you got?
[50:21.12]How do I not get that faster than anybody else?
[50:25.24]Of course, that is just so recognizable at this point.
[50:35.19]See, if I had... Wait, what is this one?
[50:39.17]Is this cheese?
[50:39.69]Did I write cheese down?
[50:42.59]Did I?
[50:45.82]No, I didn't.
[50:46.26]What is this?
[50:49.40]Is this a Spongebob thing?
[51:01.03]What is this?
[51:01.61]I know what it is.
[51:19.86]The worst emote on Twitch.
[51:26.95]Press L3.
[51:36.28]Press it?
[51:36.88]Alright, I'll press it.
[51:39.63]Nothing happened.
[51:48.53]I don't know what this one is.
[51:50.91]Lettuce?
[51:58.91]What is this?
[52:08.32]What is this?
[52:10.76]I didn't put the Joker here.
[52:20.62]I don't know what this is.
[52:22.64]Oh.
[52:25.74]Gamer.
[52:43.07]I don't remember what I wrote!
[52:52.24]Like, instantly!
[52:57.95]All you have to do is put the blue on somebody's eye.
[53:02.65]What's he holding?
[53:14.26]A horseshoe?
[53:15.50]Does Sans play horseshoes?
[53:18.89]What?
[53:37.78]Why am I guessing like I don't know?
[53:52.37]It's not like baby.
[53:57.14]What is this?
[54:03.64]What did I write?
[54:07.27]Oh, it's
[54:10.72]All you needed was the nose.
[54:13.34]And the eyes.
[54:14.06]Wait.
[54:16.11]His eyes aren't like that.
[54:17.31]That's not what Elmo looks like.
[54:22.15]That was so all over the place.
[54:24.23]I put this down, but I didn't know what Muppet that was.
[54:56.99]It's not Qbert.
[55:04.23]Qbert!
[55:07.48]No, that's not Trollface.
[55:18.74]That's Jerm of Venus.
[55:22.70]Or Qbert.
[55:27.00]You're a Q-bert.
[55:34.84]Yeah, it's me next.
[55:42.01]What's this?
[55:42.35]What are you doing?
[55:48.13]What are you doing?
[55:52.93]Is this...
[55:58.81]It's Garfield.
[55:59.59]It's not Garfield.
[56:07.08]What is that?
[56:10.70]Freckles?
[56:12.02]I don't know.
[56:12.50]What did I write?
[56:16.26]Let me see what the word is.
[56:17.14]No, it was supposed to be... Okay, that was supposed to be bald.
[56:23.93]I must have pressed S.
[56:32.94]I don't even know why I'm... Alright, I gotta... Shh.
[56:49.26]Uh... What color is his fucking hair?
[57:33.23]Um, I need, I need a... Come on, somebody!
[57:50.10]Anybody!
[57:51.98]Nobody!
[57:52.54]It's Austin Powers!
[57:54.80]But I do, uh, this idea of a space.
[58:15.35]Why are we getting a repeat?
[58:18.99]I picked these words.
[58:19.98]I picked- No, I didn't!
[58:21.32]I- Well, okay, I picked them, but I didn't- I picked them, but I didn't make them.
[58:27.32]That was- Somebody wrote that in chat, and I was like, alright, put it in a- Of course, I get it.
[58:30.76]It's the hardest one so far.
[58:40.04]Are we just restarting?
[58:41.58]Did I not put enough words?
[58:48.77]We need more words.
[58:55.08]10 words.
[59:05.58]Is this a new word?
[59:14.69]What?
[59:23.80]Me?
[59:24.06]I don't understand.
[59:25.42]Money?
[59:26.96]Money.
[59:30.94]What?
[59:31.16]I don't know.
[59:35.42]Oh, alright.
[59:36.10]I got it.
[59:36.66]Yep.
[59:37.26]Alright.
[59:40.11]That's Vegas.
[59:45.15]Pointing at me.
[59:47.59]What?
[59:48.49]Oh, that's supposed to be the Luxor.
[59:51.43]That's the Luxor in the stratosphere.
[59:58.26]No, we were Las Vegas, right?
[60:01.98]I... Uh... Tube?
[60:13.59]Oh, did I... No, I didn't.
[60:15.25]Wait.
[60:16.71]Who is that?
[60:17.76]I don't know who the fuck that's supposed to be.
[60:19.46]I thought it was Thanos.
[60:24.60]I saw the hand, like...
[60:33.86]Okay, it's fine.
[60:34.92]Now I get it.
[60:36.87]He's got a big Thanos chin, though.
[60:48.99]Chin?
[60:49.35]Yeah, this is right here.
[60:50.11]Look.
[60:50.27]What do you mean he has no chin?
[60:53.26]Look at that.
[60:53.80]It's a defined jawbone right here.
[61:00.85]Cheetos.
[61:03.59]That's a big Cheeto.
[61:14.99]Imagine opening up a bag of Cheetos and you get one like that.
[61:21.03]That would have at least 1,500 likes.
[61:32.60]Mmm.
[61:38.06]Imagine you open a bag and it's just one big Cheeto.
[61:42.10]I'm surprised they haven't done some stupid meme bullshit like that yet.
[61:52.27]What?
[62:00.81]What is this?
[62:07.70]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[62:09.38]NVIDIA.
[62:20.45]That's good, I like it.
[62:38.46]You didn't even get to draw anything.
[62:41.32]You just had to... What?
[62:47.42]Why is it NVIDIA every time?
[62:56.19]Shit, everybody was ready for it.
[62:57.45]GG.
[63:16.88]At, at, at, gg, what's this math problem?
[63:24.52]gg at times a plus, a plus, I don't understand what this is supposed to be.
[63:43.81]What?
[63:50.70]How is that wrong?
[63:51.78]What the fuck did I write?
[63:55.16]What did I do?
[63:59.00]A good game.
[64:00.70]A good game.
[64:02.65]Oh, that's because somebody said, play a good game.
[64:05.67]And I was like, alright, fine.
[64:06.99]And I typed in a good game.
[64:08.11]And I thought they were going to draw like a good, like, I don't know.
[64:10.01]You're going to draw like the box art for God of War and Speeder.
[64:25.61]That was so funny.
[64:27.43]Somebody just wrote, you need more words.
[64:30.77]Peter.
[64:32.81]Did you see that over here?
[64:34.19]Dude, you need more words.
[64:35.35]What the?
[64:36.35]Peter.
[64:45.34]Alright.
[64:49.30]Come on.
[64:49.76]Come on, Jim.
[65:00.64]A good game.
[65:01.48]Alright, well it's pointing at me.
[65:06.43]For what though?
[65:40.49]I wish I had a word list over here that I could look at, because I have no idea.
[65:48.48]Good luck.
[65:59.84]Right?
[66:03.97]That's Jerma Odin.
[66:05.01]It has to be.
[66:13.70]Oh, right.
[66:16.26]Ah!
[66:16.58]Ah!
[66:49.82]I fucked it up again.
[67:18.39]no you don't have to do the same one you don't do the same wait did you get the same one is the same person we're starting to fall into who can copy the thing that the word is the best I hope I get Peter next time
[67:50.51]Alright, next time we're gonna do one round.
[67:54.43]And I'm gonna write just random fucking nonsense words.
[68:10.06]NVIDIA, NVIDIA, NVIDIA.
[68:20.64]At me.
[68:23.02]Chat.
[68:25.20]At me.
[68:29.21]How do you draw, Leo?
[68:31.53]Um, I don't think you do.
[68:33.17]I think the answer there is you don't.
[68:35.75]Alright, I'm gonna make, we're gonna do one round, I'm gonna get good words next time.
[68:46.44]If you, if I see more than 50 of these, I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[69:03.86]That was a very low effort Peter can I say that was just two little semicircles and then eyes
[69:21.95]No, not Waluigi.
[69:25.48]It's another, like, big strong purple guy.
[69:52.15]Peter, right off the bat.
[70:13.25]How is that more recognizable than an actual container of mustard?
[70:19.77]Something about that is not right.
[70:21.63]Not right, you know what I'm saying?
[70:36.07]You've warped our minds.
[70:53.86]Oh, okay.
[70:58.09]No, it's not Waluigi, guys.
[70:59.91]It's another big strong purple guy.
[71:07.43]I'm trying, Jeroboam.
[71:14.28]Okay, I have to be ready for my turn.
[71:16.46]Because I am ending this.
[71:39.25]I'm... What?
[71:43.79]I'm trying, Jerimo.
[71:45.09]I don't understand.
[71:45.97]Is this just the same one?
[71:51.11]You actually... It is.
[71:52.09]You just did the same thing.
[72:02.91]What did I tell you?
[72:05.27]If I was going to get between 2 and 4, then I may as well never play this again.
[72:09.79]Um, it's 6.
[72:19.24]No, this isn't... Anytime the arrow points at me, it's automatically Vegas.
[72:41.29]Yep.
[72:44.73]Yeah, I know it.
[72:45.25]I'm try- OH!
[73:02.47]What?
[73:02.71]Was it my turn?
[73:04.61]It's my turn.
[73:05.01]No, it's not pointing at me.
[73:05.77]What's going on?
[73:06.49]Where was my turn?
[73:14.11]What?
[73:14.71]Did it skip me?
[73:24.69]Hi!
[73:24.85]Alright, it's my turn coming up next.
[73:38.22]This is deteriorating.
[73:41.78]This is deteriorating.
[73:46.44]No, I don't... Okay, my turn.

[74:44.76]Number one, number two, number six is me.
[74:48.36]Alright.
[74:50.40]I came between two and six.
[74:53.05]Oh, oh, he fucking leaked it.
[74:56.77]Alright, let's do it one more time.
[74:58.31]This time we're gonna do one round, or two rounds.
[75:00.09]We'll do two rounds.
[75:02.67]We're gonna do new word list.
[75:05.13]Right, okay, I gotta mute that.
[75:09.15]New word list.
[75:16.13]I'm gonna make this hard for you guys.
[75:17.27]I'm gonna make it hard for me too.
[75:36.15]Okay, let me think of some other ones.
[75:41.03]Yeah, we need like we need about 20 20 words because it's two rounds How about um
[76:14.79]Okay.
[76:21.99]How do you spell that name?
[76:24.89]I don't know.
[76:25.41]I actually don't know how to spell that, but we're just gonna do that that way.
[76:27.76]Who cares?
[76:43.44]Uh, I don't know.
[76:48.11]Why would anyone know that but me?
[76:50.37]Nobody would know the answer to that.
[76:52.57]It's impossible for someone to get that.
[76:53.87]We're going to keep it.
[77:05.54]Some of these are impossible.
[77:12.28]How about...
[77:18.15]Let's throw a couple of good ones in here.
[77:19.45]These are different, just to make sure everyone is aware, these are different words.
[77:44.86]Don't do balls this time, I won't.
[77:50.17]Call this one 10 out of 10 streaming.
[77:55.28]Oh no, are you saying that this is a 10 out of 10 stream?
[77:57.26]Thanks, I appreciate that.
[78:02.21]Alright, we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 3 more!

[78:36.25]Alright, this is good.
[78:46.95]Yeah, this will be hard.
[78:49.05]Alright, that's good.
[78:49.83]I'm ready.
[78:55.34]I'm going to remake the room.
[78:58.72]Hey, everybody in the sub channel.
[79:00.78]Get ready.

[79:12.23]Here you go.
[79:18.75]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[79:20.44]Now I freaked everybody out.
[79:21.24]Didn't put it in there yet.
[79:22.80]It's in the now.
[79:29.59]Okay.

[80:35.39]Boppin'.
[80:37.31]Is it Grimace?

[80:59.54]Now I get it.
[81:16.14]Bop it.
[81:17.74]It's dancing.
[81:20.76]I know it's a boring- I know, you gotta throw a few boring ones in.
[81:23.56]They can't all be like fucking Jerma Odin.
[81:32.79]uh all you need is just that all you need to you need the left ear to be drawn okay I don't even know what he wears for clothes
[82:11.29]By the way, I think I spelled his name wrong.
[82:13.66]I think it's Griffin, not Griffon.
[82:17.54]You gotta take that into consideration, though, that it's gonna be wrong.
[82:22.40]That's where the difficulty comes in.
[82:50.30]This is... I mean, there.
[82:52.38]There you go.
[82:53.06]Now that's better.
[82:54.96]Now that's better.
[82:56.42]That looks like somebody's pressing their face up against glass and doing like the... Oh, somebody left.
[83:26.48]I didn't know they were going to be back to back like that.
[83:33.16]I thought they were going to spread out somewhere.
[83:38.78]No one's going to get this, really.
[83:40.10]Just kidding.
[83:51.20]Cat and kitten.
[83:52.08]I wanted to try to throw you off a little.

[84:26.87]It's a toy boat.
[84:27.59]It's a toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[84:31.05]Oh, I am so good at what I do.
[84:33.09]It's unbelievable sometimes.
[84:50.71]Imagine having a barometer for success.
[84:53.41]And how good you are at something.
[84:56.77]By being able to do Toy Boat like 10 times in a row.
[85:11.68]No, yes I do.
[85:13.48]Yes I do.
[85:26.05]It looks like part of toast, man.

[85:48.14]Is it my turn?

[86:00.47]Why is there two faces?
[86:01.79]I can't even write it.
[86:12.57]I can't write it.
[86:19.92]It's again.
[86:22.18]No, that means we're not gonna get two.
[86:24.80]There's one that's not gonna be shown.
[86:27.51]It better not be Super Peter again, if it is I'm gonna be fuckin' actually upset.
[86:31.15]It's not.
[86:53.00]Pants?
[86:54.68]Clothes.
[87:03.58]Clothing clothing gone Okay, yeah, I didn't know what this is a reference to so I had I needed to wait for the J to know what it was I

[87:33.12]My turn!
[87:35.29]No.
[87:36.43]Your name is Jermite.
[87:38.29]I thought that was me.
[87:58.80]Okay.
[88:05.05]I'm seeing if people get it.
[88:08.49]I waited.
[88:08.99]I gave enough time for that.
[88:23.12]Come on.
[88:24.14]Come on, guys.
[88:25.72]What's in between those two pieces of bread?

[89:46.22]No, that's Twitchy, whatever their name is.
[89:58.95]Oh, it's a big old box.
[90:21.82]How on Earth would you get that unless you were me knowing that?
[90:28.43]This is not possible to know unless you are the person that typed this in.
[90:40.12]That's Jerma Stewie, an emote.
[90:43.08]No one would have, you would not, how would you ever write that?
[90:57.16]I think my favorite is Super Peter.
[90:58.75]That's my favorite one.
[91:07.51]Nope.
[91:11.77]I know this one.
[91:14.95]I will cheat to first place.
[91:16.31]Don't matter.
[91:16.87]It's just fun to see how you guys interpret these.
[91:25.52]You gotta get it right.
[91:28.31]You gotta get it right.
[91:29.53]Hey, that's me!
[91:31.43]You just drew me!
[91:32.61]What the fuck?
[91:35.77]That's pretty close.
[91:38.02]Holy shit.
[91:43.82]That's I Gotta Go.
[91:45.40]It's not I got to go, it's I gotta go.
[91:53.53]That's how I type it every time I write it.
[92:06.66]That's, what?
[92:07.30]Let's do a talking in the Discord channel together.
[92:25.70]I don't know, man.
[92:28.84]Blah.
[92:30.00]Wait.
[92:31.30]This is what's happening right now.
[92:38.61]Oh.
[92:39.55]Right.
[92:40.41]I forgot I wrote that.
[92:44.83]Nice.
[92:45.55]Good work.
[92:46.39]I forgot.
[92:46.83]Oh yeah, the word pool that you get.
[93:01.05]Hold on, didn't you get this last time too?
[93:06.26]Yeah, you got this last time.
[93:09.10]How?
[93:09.62]What's the probability you're getting that again?
[93:12.70]Twice in a row.
[93:13.14]It's 100%, that's the chance.
[93:21.02]50-50.
[93:29.57]I love how even though you know, you still finish the job.
[93:33.58]I respect that.
[93:34.56]You still finish the job.
[93:57.51]Alright, I'm going to give you a small amount of criticism here.
[94:03.03]The bun, I think the bun should be... I'm just kidding.
[94:08.51]I'm kidding.
[94:09.01]There's no... This is perfect.
[94:11.61]This is good.
[94:14.53]Yeah, that's good.
[94:15.73]Nice work.
[94:22.16]Toxic.
[94:24.66]No, I didn't say anything.
[94:46.57]There are enough words.
[94:47.73]There are like 23, 24 words.
[94:50.55]It just keeps giving us Super Peter.
[94:57.86]That person's like, wait, oh shit, that's what it was.
[95:00.16]Super Peter.
[95:05.95]There's a 1 out of 24 chance that we're gonna get Super Peter.
[95:09.76]We've got it like 5 times.
[95:10.74]Oh wait, they're picking the- right, they're picking the words.
[95:19.59]Right, I forgot.
[95:20.61]Yeah, that's true.
[95:21.45]Why do you guys keep picking Super Peter?! !
[95:35.66]Because it's funny.
[95:38.77]Yeah, it kind of is.
[95:39.39]You're right.

[95:55.33]We're about to round this out.
[96:26.38]Why are you giving him a cape?
[96:27.94]This is not super Stewie.
[96:35.10]It's Jerma Stewie.
[96:50.86]Did I get it wrong?
[96:52.54]What?
[96:53.82]Oh no, shit, it's...
[97:04.12]There are plenty of words.
[97:06.20]People keep picking Stewie Griffin and Peter Griffin.
[97:17.10]Someone left.
[97:17.60]They're like, fuck this.
[97:18.87]This sucks.
[97:30.11]Uh...

[97:43.67]That guy over there guessed to it.
[97:45.13]And they guessed something that they shouldn't have.

[104:28.64]Where is he?
[104:30.32]Where's my...
[104:33.95]This is just the end of Roger Rabbit with all the tunes dancing around to that, like... Like Mickey Mouse comes out and shit.
[104:52.94]Like, see?
[104:53.64]They're doing the same dance.
[104:57.20]This is, like, freaking me out.
[104:58.26]Alright, new doodle.
[104:59.12]Let's try...
[105:02.69]Long legs.
[105:04.27]There's a shoe.
[105:10.31]Another shoe.
[105:15.34]Can I make the... I can't make this bigger.
[105:16.76]There's a hand.
[105:25.34]Let's get another hand.
[105:29.92]And up to the head.
[105:39.76]That doesn't look bad.
[105:44.73]No.
[105:45.07]Keep that.
[105:45.35]That's fine.
[105:52.34]And then down here.
[105:53.30]That looks good.
[105:56.20]Let's take a look at how it moves around.
[106:08.09]Fish.
[106:08.43]A bird?
[106:09.37]You can make them fly?
[106:15.69]This is freaking me out up here.
[106:17.12]I want to get away from this.
[106:23.64]That's awesome.
[106:26.88]Alright, let's go.
[106:27.52]This is going to be... Let's do some random names.
[106:40.78]Uh, how about... Edislog.
[106:44.51]Okay, fine.
[106:55.40]This is weird.
[106:56.70]I almost thought there was audio.
[106:57.60]Look at that guy over there.
[107:09.77]This one's good, though.
[107:10.77]Look at this.
[107:11.05]It's like a dinosaur.
[107:13.96]That was pretty good.
[107:17.62]This is the realm that Jimmy got sent to.
[107:20.50]Jimmy?
[107:20.78]Don't you mean Jeffrey?
[107:21.72]No.
[107:21.88]Who was it?
[107:22.64]Fortnite Jimmy?
[107:26.30]You can load MIDI files in.
[107:27.82]I don't have any MIDI files.
[107:34.57]I want to go get a look at this one.
[107:39.17]Oh, that... I just, like, teleported off the map.
[107:44.92]Right, okay.
[107:45.52]Well, that's great.
[107:47.22]You knew it was gonna fucking show up at some point.
[107:50.20]And not only that, not only... Okay, not only is it... It's running... It's running towards me.
[107:56.73]It is sprinting towards the camera.
[108:01.05]There he is!
[108:04.32]Get in here!
[108:09.32]Just make a giant shield.
[108:18.80]Hmm.
[108:19.64]I want maybe like an... I'm gonna make a bird.
[108:22.14]A flying bird.
[108:43.86]This is supposed to be the head.
[108:44.58]Okay.
[108:54.58]This is bad.
[108:55.99]Yeah, it is.
[108:56.57]Just clear it.
[108:57.89]What if I just make a giant snake?
[109:08.05]Will the game actually register this?
[109:20.30]no that I'm gonna do I feel like this is gonna break no that doesn't work fish
[109:50.20]Register what?
[109:51.08]No, no, I'm saying like for the bone.
[109:52.84]I wish I could do separate bones.
[109:54.12]You know, I think I can.
[109:56.58]Hold on.
[109:57.28]Go back to draw.
[109:58.78]If I do separate segments.
[110:00.56]So I'm going to make a huge snake.
[110:02.56]This is segment number one.
[110:04.84]Up here.
[110:06.78]Which wraps down here into segment number two, which is this.
[110:09.89]Now starting segment number two.
[110:12.09]Now segment number three.
[110:17.75]Segment number four.
[110:23.53]Okay.
[110:25.33]Man, I just drew like a P. But let's see if that works.
[110:32.62]Holy fuck, that's a lot of subs.
[110:34.36]More subs?
[110:36.92]From Phylactery Lich.
[110:39.22]Every stream.
[110:41.94]Every stream.
[110:43.86]Phylactery gives 69 subs for the last two or three weeks.
[110:47.60]It's fucking crazy.
[110:50.94]Thank you so much, phylactery.
[110:52.38]It's completely unnecessary, but you continue.
[110:57.98]Thank you.
[111:03.24]That's a huge amount of money every time.
[111:06.79]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[111:08.17]What is plantoid?
[111:17.15]Oh, I like that.
[111:18.05]It's like a big hammer.
[111:20.08]Yeah, that's a good one.
[111:22.32]Should I call this the P-Hammer?
[111:33.07]No.
[111:38.43]I don't know.
[111:39.21]I freaked out.
[111:44.28]There's a penis in here.
[111:45.32]Be careful.
[111:46.26]Guys, there are probably a hundred penises in here.
[111:52.55]So, I don't want to turn around.
[111:55.97]If I turn around, I feel like this is going to be four or five penis sprinters.
[112:08.15]Alright, what about what's going on over here?
[112:10.27]I like this thing.
[112:17.76]Hey, the swaying guy is still here.
[112:25.56]Nope.
[112:33.57]It's so laggy.
[112:34.51]Nope.
[112:47.90]Why do people fucking like this?
[112:52.96]Penis sprinter detected.
[112:58.36]Yeah, that's a cute little, that's a fun little game.
[113:00.76]It is.
[113:02.49]We're gonna move on.
[113:06.85]You gotta watch out for the fuckin' paparazzi penis sprinters.
[113:35.51]Just leave it here.
[113:37.49]Grow up.
[113:54.44]There.
[113:56.44]Terror?
[114:01.35]Make it fly.
[114:02.43]Oh, that's a good idea.

[114:11.05]You should be reading, too.
[114:16.98]Enjoy your youth.
[114:18.34]Grow up.
[114:20.88]What is this little thing here?
[114:22.50]Look at how slow this is running.
[114:26.05]Is that my snake?
[114:27.69]I think that's mine.
[114:30.49]I need to see.
[114:40.86]No, it's not.
[114:41.36]5 FPS.
[114:44.00]Jesus.
[114:46.22]Alright, I'm out of here.
[114:47.99]This is cool.
[114:49.17]But I'm out.
[114:49.61]This is coming from a guy that streamed full unset... Hey!
