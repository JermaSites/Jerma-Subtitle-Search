[00:06.69]Hi.
[00:08.67]Hey.
[00:08.99]Hi.
[00:09.87]Hey.
[00:10.49]Hey.
[00:10.77]Hi.
[00:12.17]What's up?
[00:14.65]Welcome back to another edition of Elden Ring.
[00:25.02]I'm late, yes.
[00:27.22]By a lot.
[00:28.22]I just... Here's the thing.
[00:29.44]I'll tell you a secret.
[00:32.21]If you want to hear a stream, a streamer's secret.
[00:35.31]This is a secret we all have.
[00:36.93]So I'm really kind of blowing up every streamer here when it comes to like blowing up air.
[00:41.32]Like, don't say that we talk about it.
[00:42.64]What are you talking about?
[00:44.06]So I'm kind of going to pull the rug out here.
[00:48.01]Streamers don't shit.
[00:51.13]All day.
[00:52.93]Make sure everyone knows that.
[00:56.51]Some of them do.
[00:59.49]But, uh, for the most part, streamers, uh, pee.
[01:05.67]Oh, if you're a streamer, you gotta make sure that you're empty before you turn the stream on.
[01:14.19]Wait, I don't think I really do explain why.
[01:22.05]Now, some people have this magic power where they can just go to the bathroom and just go and be done in three minutes.
[01:30.22]I don't know how that's possible.
[01:33.72]It takes me at minimum.
[01:37.80]Okay.
[01:38.64]I get in there.
[01:40.08]Couple minutes.
[01:40.98]Sit down.
[01:41.92]Relax.
[01:42.25]Relax.
[01:43.65]What about the phone?
[01:45.15]Alright, what's my entertainment gonna be for the next maybe 5 to 10 minutes?
[01:50.04]Alright, I'm not ready yet.
[01:52.12]It's not there yet.
[01:53.98]You do it.
[01:55.52]You sit there for a little while.
[01:56.98]You have to clean up, right?
[01:58.24]Like, it takes a long time.
[02:05.69]It takes at least 10 to 20 minutes for me to go number 2.
[02:08.91]Always.
[02:09.45]Always.
[02:16.96]Hope you have more than one bathroom.
[02:21.12]I mean, I also have digestive problems too.
[02:23.90]And there he is.
[02:24.72]He just got you.
[02:26.00]And that's how you know that now you've got to apologize to me.
[02:34.22]I'm telling you right now.
[02:35.30]Alright, those of you that think that I want you to do me a favor.
[02:40.47]The next time that you are gonna go number two, and you're gonna get surprised by this because people feel the same way.
[02:45.72]When you take a shower, people think the same thing.
[02:47.88]Oh man, I take like five minute showers.
[02:49.66]What are you talking about?
[02:50.84]No, dude, you're in there for 10 to 15 minutes.
[02:53.02]You just don't, your brain is not processing it because you're like alone in a fucking cube and you're just like in your own head for fucking 10 minutes.
[03:01.89]when you go to the when you take a number two next time before you open the door to the bathroom start a timer and then put it put it away don't even look at it do what you normally would do and then I want when you come out I want you to look at it and I wanted I I'm I just you're gonna see it and you're gonna go alright it's been alright alright it's been like 12 minutes it's been like 15 minutes okay
[03:30.09]And then you're gonna come into the chat, and you're not gonna say anything.
[03:32.91]You're gonna be like, oh, hey, man, what's the stream today?
[03:34.41]What are you streaming today?
[03:36.01]Elden Ring?
[03:36.69]Oh, nice, man.
[03:41.05]The thing is, you actually should probably... Here's the thing about showers.
[03:45.20]Timing your shower is really not a bad idea, because you really can get just lost in your head while you're sitting there just scrubbing the same parts of your body you've scrubbed, like, ten times already.
[03:54.55]I think, like, having, like, a five to ten minute timer in the shower is a good kind of, like, alright, get the fuck out of there.
[04:03.39]Better for, like, you know, water and stuff.
[04:05.03]You don't want to waste too much water.
[04:07.15]But also just for your routine for the day, too.
[04:10.21]You'd be surprised how long you're actually in there for.
[04:11.83]Yeah, and you've got to dry, too.
[04:19.31]People think that the whole routine in the bathroom is five, ten minutes.
[04:22.37]No.
[04:23.11]You've got to dry.
[04:24.63]You've got to comb your hair.
[04:25.79]You've got to do your skincare routine.
[04:28.00]Moisturizing, toothbrushing.
[04:30.46]It's like 40 minutes to an hour to do a morning routine.
[04:33.50]Dude, if I was like president of the world, I would sign like a presidential world executive order.
[04:42.51]That nothing was allowed to begin.
[04:46.02]Nothing.
[04:46.36]Didn't matter what it was.
[04:47.90]Before 9 a.m.
[04:50.06]Before 10 a.m.
[04:50.80]Like everything had to start at at least 9 a.m.
[04:53.80]At least.
[04:57.67]up everything because there's like this stuff that like requires like really early morning stuff like okay that would fuck up the entire world never mind
[05:09.56]No, not ambulances.
[05:11.08]No, no, no, no.
[05:12.02]It would be, like, specific industries.
[05:13.90]Alright, what I just said was really stupid, okay?
[05:16.44]That was stupid.
[05:17.72]Because if you make everything have to start at 9am, then what happens if something happens at 8am?
[05:23.06]What if, like, there's, like, logistics that have to happen at, like, 4, 5, 6 o'clock in the morning somewhere?
[05:33.50]Speak for yourself, I'm a morning person.
[05:37.13]You were onto something there.
[05:44.87]What about time zones?
[05:47.57]Now, nothing as president of the entire universe.
[05:54.64]Nothing is allowed to begin before I get up.
[06:02.66]9 a.m.
[06:02.92]Pacific time.
[06:05.00]When I get up, that's when the world starts.
[06:08.58]And we play the world anthem for me.
[06:14.26]My favorite song.
[06:16.53]Learn to Fly by the Foo Fighters.
[06:19.21]Everybody has to listen to it.
[06:24.24]Alright, let's go.
[06:24.88]We're going to do Elden Ring again.
[06:27.58]9 p.m.
[06:31.11]start.
[06:32.82]You understand my point, though.
[06:34.88]It takes a lot longer than you think it does to do a morning routine.
[06:37.38]And yeah, it's the afternoon, I know.
[06:39.24]This wasn't a morning routine.
[06:40.90]I had other things I had to take care of in the morning.
[06:42.88]I got up at 9am.
[06:44.52]Of course I did.
[06:46.40]I got up at 9am and did my taxes.
[06:49.28]I ran two miles.
[06:51.46]I ate a full breakfast with pretty much all vitamins covered.
[06:58.33]I consulted for a few companies.
[06:59.87]I consulted for some people.
[07:02.89]Made a few bucks, you know, consulting.
[07:05.06]And then I got in the shower.
[07:06.42]Then I took a shit.
[07:07.18]It took 45 minutes, okay?
[07:09.02]So it takes me an hour to get my routine done, of my cleansing routine.
[07:12.62]That's what I'm gonna call it.
[07:13.38]Hi.
[07:22.10]Dude, some people are just different.
[07:25.39]Yeah, I agree.
[07:25.95]Some people are just built differently, aren't they?
[07:33.29]I'm going to tell you, every single one of these Elden Ring streams is going to start weird.
[07:36.27]This is the way it is.
[07:42.02]Every single Elden Ring stream is going to be a weird stream.
[07:45.30]Because it's equal parts me excited, equal parts me annoyed of me not being able to beat that last boss.
[07:50.93]And equal parts me being happy that this is a thing that I'm happy playing.
[07:55.71]I don't think it's ever happened before.
[07:56.87]I would like somebody to figure this out.
[07:58.37]Someone that's been in the community for a long time.
[08:01.55]I don't think there's ever been a... I don't... I might break a personal channel record here.
[08:08.14]Of games streamed in a row, times streamed in a row.
[08:13.42]I think we're about to break a channel record here.
[08:20.51]What's on this shirt?
[08:22.07]Dr. Pepper.
[08:22.49]40 hour in a row.
[08:31.04]It'll probably be a little bit more than that after today.
[08:35.78]Sorcery was pretty long.
[08:36.76]I don't know if it was... 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours.
[08:41.22]Especially if I decide... If I don't decide to take tomorrow off... You're talking about probably 50 to 60 hours in a row.
[08:48.02]Which I've never, ever done.
[08:49.34]Ever.
[08:51.14]Ever.
[08:53.10]Since YouTube, even.
[08:54.28]Like 10, 12 fucking years ago.
[08:57.82]Alright, so last thing we did, I beat that boss in the academy.
[09:00.76]I got some cool stuff.
[09:01.82]We have leveled up a few times.
[09:05.04]The Jedi game was long.
[09:06.72]I'm talking in a row.
[09:08.80]Right?
[09:09.06]Like, I'm talking in, you know, like, Monday 10 hours, Tuesday 10 hours, Wednesday 10 hours, Thursday 10 hours.
[09:15.43]Like, I don't think I've ever done it.
[09:20.57]You already decided to take tomorrow off.
[09:23.82]Yes, but here's the thing.
[09:26.55]Tomorrow is very relative.
[09:28.95]Tomorrow is an incredibly relative term.
[09:31.73]Because it's 5pm Pacific right now.
[09:35.03]And I'm about to start playing Elden Ring.
[09:38.75]I might be streaming into tomorrow.
[09:44.60]If you understand what I'm saying here.
[09:47.56]If this is another 10-12 hour stream or something, I might be streaming into tomorrow morning.
[09:55.05]So, that's what I mean when I say take tomorrow off.
[09:59.53]The ominous music in the background.
[10:01.16]It's all relative.
[10:04.44]We'll see.
[10:05.12]Look, I'm fine.
[10:05.78]I'm fine.
[10:06.14]I've got Macho Powder, which is a fucking superpower.
[10:13.11]I wish I was fucking around.
[10:14.23]I, like, really do.
[10:15.51]I'm not kidding you.
[10:18.66]I'm not kidding.
[10:19.32]I've been drinking, like, matcha.
[10:21.30]Just, like, yeah, I have, like, a matcha tea.
[10:23.04]Like, when we start.
[10:25.62]Some, like, vitamins and stuff.
[10:28.10]I feel, like, fucking fantastic.
[10:33.98]This has been a long time since I felt like this after streaming.
[10:37.94]What about your kidneys?
[10:38.74]This is green tea.
[10:44.37]It's green tea!
[10:47.62]Is there an item here?
[10:51.38]Wait, why is there... Didn't I pick this up?
[11:01.25]Okay.
[11:01.95]So I didn't pick this up.
[11:03.47]Somehow.
[11:05.99]Oh!
[11:12.43]Cool.
[11:14.87]Why do I have to look... I look like... Okay.
[11:18.07]I look like the witch from Snow White.
[11:24.54]That's not going on.
[11:26.66]Although it looks kind of cool.
[11:29.54]Increases your health, though.
[11:33.99]That's not bad.
[11:36.21]That's cool, but not great.
[11:39.77]It's Captain Hook.
[11:42.19]We have to stay with the Burger King because the intelligence is just where it's at for me.
[11:49.11]The Big Bad Wolf.
[11:50.29]That's what I was thinking of.
[11:51.55]Well, it could go either way.
[11:55.34]I'm thinking of all the characters I've seen in Disney movies that their nose goes like this and their chin goes like this, almost meeting in the middle.
[12:08.03]Okay, so let's go here.
[12:17.08]Goofy.
[12:19.80]All the witches in Disney are like... They're like, oh, yes, my pretty.
[12:25.84]They have like beaks.
[12:26.56]Alright, where are we going?
[12:36.33]This is where I was last time.
[12:41.25]Doofenshmirtz.
[12:47.54]Doofenshmirtz!
[12:48.58]Doofenshmirtz!
[12:49.50]Yes, exactly!
[12:53.79]Oh, yes, I'll bury the platypus, my pretty!
[12:56.35]Right, like... Who's that?
[13:09.53]What is this thing?
[13:10.23]Alright.
[13:12.27]Headphones going in for this.
[13:13.17]I feel like this is going to be.
[13:14.29]What is.
[13:14.57]This is like a. Oh.
[13:16.09]Oh.
[13:16.85]Look at the beak on this one.
[13:28.96]You got a lot of health.
[13:37.81]Did I get behind you?
[13:38.79]Yeah.
[13:48.69]Oof!
[13:49.17]That didn't really do much, and that was a bad time to wind up like that.
[13:55.49]Are you susceptible to magic?
[13:59.94]Oh, that's a long fall.
[14:02.98]Dude, settle down!
[14:09.07]Wrong button.
[14:20.02]155.
[14:22.80]Oh, that's a stagger!
[14:29.71]That thing, if you hit it twice in a row... Holy shit, what?
[14:39.57]Land Octopus Ovary.
[14:41.75]Ugh.
[14:46.46]Okay, so this... I hit that twice, and he... Boom!
[14:50.14]Got staggered.
[14:54.64]That's a really crazy enemy.
[14:55.76]This reminds me of Bloodborne.
[14:56.86]This is like a Bloodborne enemy.
[15:01.64]Okay, so... We can take this off, because I already have the key.
[15:06.85]The dragon's still there.
[15:10.03]Now here's the question.
[15:16.74]How come he can't do 3k damage every fight?
[15:18.52]Because that was... The enemy was susceptible.
[15:24.26]Oh, give the key to that guy.
[15:25.41]Right.
[15:30.59]Where was that dummy?
[15:32.11]Over here, right?
[15:37.92]Hopefully this isn't going to mess me up, but I'm going to give it to him.
[15:40.54]Are you still chasing me?
[15:46.46]Get out of here.
[15:51.53]Didn't he say, oh, if you end up finding a second key, bring it to me, right?
[16:00.22]What does it say?
[16:06.01]Okay, I can't even give it to him.
[16:07.05]I can't give it to him.
[16:07.81]Oh.
[16:08.01]Well, I have to find another one.
[16:31.20]sad oh so we're not gonna do that here's I think I want to go this way we've gone way way far up here on the uh the western kind of like northwestern side because I wanted to do the academy to get the spells which I did which is cool but now I think I want to go over here like this way
[16:58.44]Because it's time to start trekking this way.
[17:01.31]And I probably can't.
[17:02.05]I got here way too early.
[17:03.21]But once I go through this section, maybe, I'll be leveled enough to do this section.
[17:12.21]I think that's the play.
[17:13.30]That's where I'm going to go.
[17:14.74]So we're going to go down here.
[17:15.50]We're going to take this road here.
[17:16.40]We're going to start exploring this area here.
[17:19.92]And if anybody has a problem with that, then you can just leave.
[17:23.46]Huh.
[17:33.75]We'll go here.
[17:37.01]Did you say that Souls games are grindy?
[17:39.12]Well, it depends on how easy you want to make the game.
[17:42.62]Difficulty slider for Souls games is how long you are willing to grind Souls to make your character stronger to fight whatever you want.
[17:50.77]So, if you can really, really hunker down and really just desperately try to learn each encounter of bosses in major places, then... Yeah, I mean, you could say you have to kind of grind a little.
[18:05.46]I don't think that much, though, to get to a point where you're capable of fighting something.
[18:11.48]But... I think that...
[18:18.16]Grinding souls is just your way to make the game a little easier for you.
[18:23.02]And there's nothing wrong with that.
[18:23.90]There really isn't.
[18:27.80]Don't let anybody tell you that.
[18:30.36]Oh, you leveled up like three or four more times.
[18:33.55]And like you went to fight the first boss.
[18:36.45]Casual.
[18:40.09]You have to be clear.
[18:41.37]Not everybody wants to play the naked guy with the club with zero stats.
[18:50.11]And the fact that some people do, it's like, holy SHIT!
[18:56.87]You're, like, really, really fucking incredibly talented, and you have, like, an insane reaction time.
[19:03.30]And you're able to give yourself, like, an absurd challenge, right?
[19:05.86]Like, a really, really big challenge.
[19:08.50]And that's commendable, it is.
[19:09.65]That's awesome.
[19:11.27]But, like, people are just gonna play the game differently, right?
[19:13.09]Like, it's...
[19:18.64]I mean, okay, if I were to level up like 50 times before going to the first boss, then it's like, uh, you're gonna kill him in like 10 swings.
[19:29.03]At that point, it's like, alright, well, I mean, you kind of might be missing out on some of the fun of the game at that point.
[19:36.33]Like... Yeah, I just went into the... I went into the first boss area.
[19:40.75]I'm level 80.
[19:42.85]And I can kill... I can kill Margit in four swings.
[19:47.29]That's like... Yeah, that kind of maybe goes against like the... Oh, these guys get up.
[20:00.68]Cool and calculated fall joke, man.
[20:02.30]Yeah.
[20:04.38]Stop monologuing at us.
[20:09.82]The point is, don't be ashamed if you gotta level up five, six more times before going to a boss.
[20:16.99]It's not a contest.
[20:26.95]The reason why that's encouraged in this game is because unlike other Souls games...
[20:33.38]Doing that is not discouraged, because there's so much shit to do in the main world that's not just linearly go to each boss.
[20:40.06]There's so many things to see that, like, going and, like, leveling and grinding in other places and, like, finding new things to play and new bosses, little minigames and stuff.
[20:50.57]Go do it.
[20:54.96]No, don't howl.
[20:55.48]It makes me want to...
[21:01.19]What's the deal with these guys that just light up?
[21:10.64]These guys turn red.
[21:15.33]I have to figure out what that means.
[21:21.37]The music has changed though.
[21:38.22]Why has the music changed?
[21:52.41]It's like... Have I been here before?
[21:57.07]I haven't been this way.
[22:03.99]I haven't been down... I've been here, but I don't... Let me just look down here and see if there's anything over here.
[22:16.86]Yeah, this stuff... I didn't go down this little river.
[22:23.10]I also like how everywhere those things are.
[22:29.36]What?
[22:31.39]Why is the horse not allowed here?
[22:35.29]Did I just get game mechanic spoiled of an encounter that's about to happen?
[22:39.37]I got game mechanic spoiled.
[22:42.29]Bloody Finger Nerijus?
[22:54.94]What?
[22:58.18]How did that not hit him?
[23:02.80]Dude, how come you're faster than I am?
[23:08.15]Somebody, Bloody Finger Hunter is summoned?
[23:12.25]I got a buddy?
[23:14.43]Help me!
[23:16.19]Kill him!
[23:20.09]Get him, get him!
[23:24.84]Nice parry.
[23:25.80]Who is this?
[23:27.20]Oh, I gotta make sure he doesn't die.
[23:35.31]Yeah, fuck you invader!
[23:41.10]You're not even hurting him.
[23:55.33]Look at those dodges, oh my god.
[23:57.29]I can feel that guy's sweat dripping from his head from here.
[24:01.86]Oh, you're out of Estus.
[24:11.68]Protect the caster, protect the healer.
[24:19.65]Got him.
[24:22.63]So what was that all about?
[24:30.44]Reduvia.
[24:31.66]With his accomplished goal, Bloody Finger Hunter Yura returned to his world.
[24:40.99]What was that?
[24:47.77]Is that a key item?
[24:59.09]What was that thing called?
[25:05.33]No, where is it?
[25:10.39]What the hell was that thing just called?
[25:11.49]Oh.
[25:18.05]Arcane.
[25:21.13]This thing scales with arcane.
[25:27.41]This dagger rips the flesh as it enters, inflicting blood loss with... Yeah.
[25:36.62]Reduvia Bloodblade.
[25:39.92]Slash with the Wicked Dagger.
[25:42.18]Transforming its never-drying bloodstains into airborne bloodblades.
[25:45.30]I want to see what it looks like.
[25:49.46]That's pretty sick looking, though.
[25:50.50]There's a dagger.
[25:51.76]And it scales with Dex and Arcane.
[25:53.53]That's really cool looking.
[25:59.09]Let me see what the combat art is.
[26:03.07]What?
[26:03.35]What?
[26:10.38]Okay, this is awesome.
[26:12.88]I'm assuming that's the part that scales with Arcane.
[26:17.48]This does bleed?
[26:18.35]That's a dagger with ranged.
[26:27.37]That's pretty amazing.
[26:28.27]Alright, well.
[26:31.47]That was a cool encounter.
[26:35.43]Am I still red?
[26:36.13]I just am.
[26:37.41]I got a lot of blood in my face.
[26:38.69]There's blood all over my body.
[26:40.47]It's everywhere inside of me.
[26:42.29]Sometimes it goes up here.
[26:48.35]Let's keep going.
[26:52.40]Any other weird shit that I didn't see?
[26:56.56]What was the... Where was the encounter?
[26:57.91]Where was that?
[26:59.55]Uh, that... That triggered when I went through... So here, I'll show you.
[27:04.37]I walked through this kind of tunnel river area.
[27:11.77]Down here.
[27:14.33]So here, from this... From the Murkwater Coast bonfire, I went through here to the river, and that started here.
[27:24.04]And I don't know if it's guaranteed drop from that guy.
[27:25.94]It might be.
[27:26.36]Maybe it's not.
[27:26.91]A lot of stuff in these games is not.
[27:29.97]We took a 40 minute long shit.
[27:34.07]I didn't take a 40 minute long shit.
[27:36.15]I'm just saying my routine to get cleaned up is like an hour.
[27:39.38]This is a dungeon.
[27:46.52]Murkwater Cave.
[27:50.15]Nice.
[27:55.32]But you see, like, okay, if you're getting your ass kicked by a boss and you just can't do it, it's so hard to pull because you want to get it done, right?
[28:04.22]It's the hardest thing to stop.
[28:07.14]Get out of there and, like, come down here.
[28:09.34]There's, like, so much more to the game than fighting the three-phased boss encounter with 500 million HP.
[28:23.64]I think I want to
[28:27.77]Hmm.
[28:31.01]No, this is good for now.
[28:31.81]Maybe I should put on the starlight.
[28:47.99]What's that guy doing?
[29:03.91]What a weird patrol.
[29:05.08]Ah, I gotta get my steps in.
[29:10.58]If I can make sure that I can post about it.
[29:13.00]It didn't hit everybody.
[29:27.61]Should've.
[29:30.34]What the fuck are you throwing at me?
[29:34.18]I thought- This is where this thing is gonna shine, man, and I have to get it.
[29:47.93]See?
[29:57.25]Alright.
[29:57.59]That was weird.
[30:05.85]What is ringing that bell?
[30:06.95]I need starlight.
[30:08.17]I can't see shit.
[30:09.25]I want starlight.
[30:11.31]I don't care if these guys respawn.
[30:14.29]Cave moss?
[30:26.20]A mushroom.
[30:27.12]Five mushrooms.
[30:27.94]That was in the chest?
[30:30.58]Who puts five mushrooms in a treasure chest?
[30:37.28]That seems like- what a waste of a chest.
[30:49.09]It's this shit.
[30:50.45]These bells.
[30:51.32]I need starlight.
[30:54.44]I'm running into bells, I think.
[30:55.94]Gimme starlight.
[31:05.07]Oh.
[31:10.51]Okay.
[31:11.51]Um... Where the fuck did I come from?
[31:23.64]Where did I come from?
[31:24.34]Where's my bonfire?
[31:25.80]Where am I?
[31:30.86]What?
[31:31.86]Over here?
[31:37.70]Oh, okay.
[31:38.15]I can't see shit.
[31:45.07]Oh, it is just a boss.
[31:46.37]Alright, well, never mind.
[31:48.39]No object permanence?
[31:49.43]I couldn't see!
[31:50.35]Look!
[31:53.24]It's just- That- Okay, I- Can you see in there?
[31:56.60]FIET!
[31:58.20]Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[32:05.70]What is in this room?
[32:06.82]We'll find out very shortly.
[32:35.33]Something's gonna crash through that.
[32:47.28]Something's running around up there.
[32:49.00]It's giving me a little alien thing.
[33:04.16]Patches?
[33:04.89]Of course Patches is in this game.
[33:08.57]Patches.
[33:38.03]Wait, please Really
[34:07.58]Okay.
[34:08.73]So... Patches is in the game.
[34:12.87]I just had to turn the volume up a little bit, and I'm terrified that I'm going to accidentally click back into the window of the game.
[34:18.42]Yep.
[34:19.32]Okay.
[34:19.64]Okay.
[34:24.36]I don't know.
[34:25.78]He's going to do it again, right?
[34:28.24]He's absolutely going to do it again.
[34:58.05]okay so if some things can't be forgiven and we backstab him and kill him we'll get something that he has on him whatever it is forgive and forget means he becomes a vendor which he might sell something useful and he also might show up later in the game
[35:15.73]A true man of reason.
[35:17.35]I'm curious.
[35:18.13]Just what I like about you.
[35:20.29]I'm Patches.
[35:21.61]Patches the untethered.
[35:23.85]Tarnished like you, only free-spirited.
[35:27.35]Nomadic, you might say.
[35:29.33]Only for now, those retired soldiers turned bandits.
[35:33.50]They're paying for my gruel.
[35:35.58]In exchange for my, well...
[35:37.80]Showing them the ropes.
[35:39.12]Honestly, this looting racket is bloody terrifying.
[35:44.18]Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean.
[35:47.68]Maybe set up a legitimate shop.
[35:50.20]So don't be a stranger.
[35:51.12]I'm ready to wheel and deal.
[35:53.07]Come next time.
[35:56.05]Yes!
[35:56.75]Somebody did it!
[35:59.93]Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.
[36:02.99]I'll be ready to wheel and deal.
[36:04.85]Come next time.
[36:06.89]Oh.
[36:07.63]Okay, so I gotta come back here and he'll have a shop here?
[36:10.67]Alright, we gotta reload the area.
[36:16.08]Because... I mean, what do you got?
[36:22.35]You're aware Patches is a reoccurring character.
[36:23.87]Oh, yeah.
[36:25.41]He's always a dick.
[36:26.03]He always, like, fucks with you.
[36:28.59]He's always, like, a weird friend slash foe that always is an asshole.
[36:33.27]But sometimes he can be kind of useful.
[36:35.75]Sometimes he can be kind of useful.
[36:40.15]Let's come right back.
[36:45.90]Just kill him.
[36:46.40]He's going to backstab you in the next Souls game.
[36:51.71]Okay, so can I go back down here now?
[36:55.69]Do I have to pass time or will he just be... Can I just do it?
[37:02.02]What was with the bells?
[37:04.54]That was weird.
[37:05.26]What was with the bells?
[37:06.68]Why all the bells?
[37:26.16]It's just like an alarm system.
[37:34.10]Okay.
[37:36.96]Easy.
[37:37.28]I want these.
[37:37.70]Okay, so is he here?
[37:41.21]There's another chest there.
[37:46.99]Well, nice of you to drop in finally.
[37:49.11]It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something.
[37:53.68]And welcome to Patch's Emporium.
[37:56.58]Where you won't need a refund, because everything's top notch.
[38:02.13]Purchase.
[38:02.53]Okay, purchase.
[38:05.63]What do you got here?
[38:06.53]Alright.
[38:09.25]Boost Rune Acquisition for a time.
[38:11.47]What?
[38:12.45]That's what that does?
[38:16.89]Market's Shackle.
[38:20.96]Briefly binds Margit, once imprisoned, to Earth.
[38:26.37]What?
[38:29.29]Is this a way to make that fight easier?
[38:31.41]Ooh, you got a key.
[38:40.70]What?
[38:41.04]Okay.
[38:45.64]It's like Gascoigne's music box.
[38:47.60]Okay.
[38:48.56]Well, that's where that is.
[38:52.01]Carrying dagger, that's what that is.
[38:54.35]Horse crest, wooden shield.
[38:55.89]Sacrificial twig.
[38:58.57]Oh, this is if you die, you don't lose your runes.
[39:05.22]I kind of want these.
[39:10.66]I feel like going to that kind of farming zone that I was in before, turning that on, I wonder how long it lasts.
[39:21.67]He also sells one of these too.
[39:23.01]Alright, what's in the chest?
[39:23.89]Let me ask him about the bandits though.
[39:26.11]Maybe he's got some info.
[39:27.11]What's going on?
[39:27.57]Hmm.
[39:27.67]Hmm.
[39:49.54]Worked to the bone by their high and mighty lord.
[39:52.94]Only to be thrown out with the rubbish.
[39:56.71]It's the same old story everywhere I go.
[40:00.53]To hell with it all.
[40:01.23]How does Patches keep getting in every single universe?
[40:03.77]That's what I want to know.
[40:08.62]That chest over there.
[40:09.70]Yep.
[40:12.76]Wondering what's inside the treasure chest.
[40:16.69]You do something to me again, I'm killing you.
[40:21.05]It's going to be a trap.
[40:22.01]Huh?
[40:38.48]Everything is give and take.
[40:40.00]Yeah.
[40:40.34]Give and take.
[40:42.18]There's going to be a bomb in there.
[40:43.96]Okay.
[40:45.06]Cheers for that.
[40:45.76]So we might as well just open it.
[40:46.96]So you guys can laugh at the fucking explosion that happens in my face.
[40:49.94]Or like the poison gas.
[40:51.50]Here we go.
[41:02.02]Well, well, well.
[41:04.84]I should have known.
[41:06.24]You skinny little thief.
[41:09.68]The gods demand vengeance.
[41:11.59]Vengeance!
[41:18.43]Okay.
[41:22.35]Could've rolled away?
[41:23.17]He's just a cat!
[41:35.74]Where the fuck did you put me?
[41:48.47]Give me whatever that is.
[41:49.19]Whoa, that's got a huge arc.
[42:03.84]Map.
[42:04.42]Get it before I die.
[42:12.08]Yeah.
[42:18.44]Dagger!
[42:24.31]Oh!
[42:57.13]Damn!
[42:58.19]I got him.
[42:58.83]He's dead?
[43:02.47]I actually got the full charge.
[43:04.93]I actually got it.
[43:06.79]That was almost 800 damage.
[43:08.43]Damn.
[43:09.90]Okay, cool.
[43:10.62]So where am I?
[43:12.60]Wingrave East.
[43:15.36]This is exactly where I wanted to go.
[43:17.62]You put me in the exact area I wanted to be in.
[43:21.30]Thanks, Patches.
[43:22.62]You're a real friend.
[43:29.62]Let me get to a road though.
[43:35.81]What's this big tree?
[43:41.64]Is that the Elden Tree?
[43:42.87]Whatever the thing's called?
[43:57.25]Anything?
[43:59.85]What are these?
[44:00.41]Do these refill your flasks?
[44:02.47]I think these are flask refillers.
[44:14.52]Spiked Cracked Tear.
[44:17.08]Green Spill Crystal Tear.
[44:21.38]What is that?
[44:24.18]Temporarily boosts stamina in mixed physic.
[44:27.90]Enhances charge attacks for a time in mixed physic.
[44:30.22]What is this physic thing?
[44:33.86]Unlock the rune you got from Godrick, please.
[44:37.76]What do you mean?
[44:39.44]Alright, well this is a minor elder tree.
[44:50.41]That's a refillable potion.
[44:51.69]Really?
[44:58.52]You have to go to a tower to unlock it.
[45:00.74]Oh.
[45:00.86]Well, I don't know that yet.
[45:04.10]Spoiled me.
[45:05.46]Actually, I did know that.
[45:07.44]Alright, this is kind of an ocean here.
[45:11.52]Miner Erdtree.
[45:13.50]Why is that on here?
[45:17.24]There's a reason why that's here, right?
[45:20.48]It's on the map.
[45:21.96]What?
[45:25.46]Like a dungeon?
[45:29.03]Or is it just, hey, here's one of them.
[45:34.73]That looks like I can get in there.
[45:36.29]Doesn't it?
[45:36.59]That looks like I can get in there.
[45:48.06]Oh.
[45:48.90]What's this?
[45:50.46]An observatory.
[45:57.78]Whoa.
[45:58.70]Where am I?
[45:59.48]What the fuck?
[46:00.44]This game is fucking insane.
[46:07.05]This is crazy.
[46:08.45]There's this much random shit for you just to go do.
[46:12.65]I need a... Okay.
[46:15.14]Is there a fire down here?
[46:16.48]I hope so.
[46:16.84]I'll find out.
[46:32.48]What the fuck is happening?
[46:49.87]What the fuck?
[46:50.57]This is such a huge elevator.
[46:57.35]How long is this ride?
[47:00.10]My head would have exploded from the underwater pressure by now.
[47:15.12]The hell?
[47:29.07]Siofra River.
[47:34.21]Well, we got one.
[47:35.15]Okay.
[47:42.80]I don't have enough to level up.
[47:46.50]Um... I think my flasks are okay.
[47:48.82]I think five and two is fine.
[47:49.90]Let's take a look.
[47:54.86]What's this shit?
[47:59.99]Okay, well, there's a summoning statue thing here.
[48:04.11]Oh, you... Okay.
[48:15.18]Rune.
[48:29.78]Oh.
[48:42.71]We're calling finger.
[48:44.01]I might just sell a lot of the PvP stuff.
[49:00.91]Get all the items.
[49:02.51]No stone.
[49:04.17]Unturned.
[49:08.69]Silver Firefly.
[49:10.39]Which is also new.
[49:15.35]No stone unturned.
[49:18.95]More runes.
[49:27.79]Alright, where's the, where's the, where's the guy that's gonna be around the corner with like a giant, yeah.
[49:37.44]Are they casters?
[49:47.82]They look like casters.
[49:52.77]Those are staves.
[49:53.31]Those are staves.
[49:54.55]These are casters.
[50:05.02]Are they casters?
[50:06.32]They're not.
[50:06.66]They just have shiny things.
[50:07.47]Alright, let's go.
[50:09.17]We know how to deal with groups.
[50:15.74]They're in slow motion.
[50:20.82]We know how to deal with groups.
[50:25.89]Not bad.
[50:32.73]Commune to that.
[50:47.28]What the fuck was that hitbox, hum?
[51:11.54]These guys do not get staggered, really.
[51:17.36]It's so slow.
[51:18.00]It's so weird.
[51:21.11]Okay, that takes care of that.
[51:45.51]Rune, probably.
[51:46.99]Oh, nice.
[51:47.51]I need a five somber stone, right?
[52:00.83]What is that?
[52:01.43]Oh, my God.
[52:02.49]There's like a shining thing up there.
[52:03.77]That's like a hyper item.
[52:06.91]Look up.
[52:10.23]What do you want me to look up for?
[52:15.51]Why is there a riddler?
[52:17.03]Why is the riddler here?
[52:18.51]Oh, no.
[52:19.13]It's a golden centipede.
[52:26.50]There's nothing... Stop.
[52:27.32]I don't know what you're talking about.
[52:35.72]Runes.
[52:39.69]I wonder if I can just, like... Do these guys have any brains at all?
[52:43.03]Probably not.
[52:44.21]They're so slow.
[52:50.59]Yeah, alright.
[52:56.07]Look up, look up, look up.
[53:00.78]It's structure and bones and material and shit.
[53:04.80]It's mountains.
[53:12.62]It's like a sky with...
[53:16.36]Alright.
[53:19.00]I'm not looking up anymore.
[53:20.36]I'm not getting baited, like, over and over again.
[53:45.52]Exploded I
[54:16.05]That was definitely it!
[54:18.31]Nooo!
[54:30.94]Stop!
[54:43.52]These guys hit so hard.
[54:55.09]And they're just so slow.
[54:56.31]You're in slow motion.
[54:57.15]You make me angry.
[54:57.81]Alright.
[55:06.50]What does that thing do?
[55:07.24]I think it's just a big AOE.
[55:15.69]I can't really get behind them, so we're just gonna have to... Those go... Nope.
[55:36.79]I can't pull them, so I don't even need to try.
[55:44.32]Immunizing cured meat.
[55:57.37]No, I want to do this.
[55:59.07]Why can't I backstab him?
[56:12.83]Rainbow stones.
[56:13.43]Those things will make it so you don't get lost.
[56:21.20]Which, in this game, they actually might be very useful.
[56:24.16]Unlike previous games where it really kind of didn't matter that much.
[56:26.40]In previous games, those little pebbles were cool, but I feel like in a game like this, they're way more helpful.
[56:54.88]There's so many people over here.
[56:57.17]For what?
[56:59.55]There are a shitload of you here.
[57:01.09]Is there something here?
[57:01.73]I'm not going to fight these guys at this point.
[57:09.50]Is there an item?
[57:15.66]I don't see an item.
[57:22.29]Mushrooms.
[57:22.73]They're just chilling.
[57:25.73]Yeah, I don't see anything.
[57:26.75]I think that's just kind of... You don't have to go through the front door?
[57:29.57]Unless there's something there that's glowing.
[57:31.03]I don't see it.
[57:38.34]No, I think that's just all their staffs.
[57:39.62]There's nothing here.
[57:45.54]Okay, well, let's keep going.
[57:46.46]Do I have Scarlet Rod?
[57:50.50]I don't believe so.
[57:53.78]Wouldn't that be on the screen?
[58:01.03]We'll go over here.
[58:05.45]Yep.
[58:05.79]Item right there.
[58:09.27]Game's too dark.
[58:09.91]Turn up the brightness.
[58:10.81]I think that's intentional.
[58:11.69]I didn't think I was going to see you back here, did you?
[58:19.00]No!
[58:19.56]Kill it, please!
[58:21.46]No!
[58:21.82]Kill it!
[58:22.16]No!
[58:28.54]Aww.
[58:28.66]I thought it was gonna be an item.
[58:37.74]Okay.
[58:39.00]Something right here.
[58:46.32]Budding Horn.
[58:49.22]I have to sit down and craft.
[58:50.81]I have like five backpacks full of stuff that I haven't even opened.
[58:59.12]Okay, so this is probably a boss door.
[59:04.23]Big waterfall.
[59:07.94]Interesting.
[59:27.17]Ooh, Ghost Glove War.
[59:28.87]That's really important.
[59:32.49]I could probably go through the waterfall.
[59:36.27]It's definitely, like, a secret thing to go through.
[59:37.74]Yeah, dude, I'm sorry.
[59:46.24]I'm not gonna, like, pick up an item over here and have ten of you get up and kill me.
[59:50.04]Okay.
[60:09.01]Backstabbing takes too long to skill him.
[60:25.30]Damn it.
[60:28.49]Come here!
[60:35.61]That thing is good, but they have so much health.
[60:49.62]Clayman's Harpoon?
[60:50.94]These people made it out of clay?
[61:04.68]Clayman's Harpoon.
[61:07.78]Nobody else here, right?
[61:08.40]I want to see what that is.
[61:15.01]Int Scaling?
[61:19.41]Harpoon with a tip made from a sharpened meteorite shard wielded by the Claymen who infest dynastic remains.
[61:27.27]blade emits a faint light and deals magic damage.
[61:42.14]Oh, whoa.
[61:44.10]That's cool.
[61:47.36]That's like a magic damage thrust.
[61:48.78]That's actually really good.
[61:52.90]The ink weapon.
[61:53.62]That's awesome.
[61:54.14]Alright, I'm not going to get rid of this in case I need it for some reason.
[62:00.13]Okay, let me put my other weapon on, the one I'm actually going to use.
[62:03.14]Now I'm fat rolling, so that's going to help.
[62:04.52]I think stone.
[62:09.76]That one's got to go back in.
[62:12.54]Let's go.
[62:19.25]Alright, there's no way there's not something in the waterfall.
[62:23.39]Alright.
[62:24.49]Impossible.
[62:28.40]When has there ever been a video game?
[62:30.67]Soap.
[62:35.07]Is there soap in the waterfall?
[62:36.91]What the fuck?
[62:41.13]Is it a crafting material?
[62:49.26]Soap.
[62:55.83]What is it?
[63:05.91]It removes filth and accumulations on the body.
[63:12.40]What?
[63:17.50]Filth covering the exterior eventually seeps in, so if you get dirty... Okay, filth is in the game.
[63:25.72]I imagine that's poison buildup.
[63:28.28]Maybe?
[63:29.02]Alright, well, here's the big door.
[63:37.32]It's time to find out what's going on here.
[63:39.86]Although, I might want to not do this yet.
[63:43.02]Because I have a lot of runes.
[63:44.38]I can probably level up before I get killed by whatever the enemy is up here.
[63:47.48]I don't know.
[63:54.24]Those guys are so slow.
[63:56.14]It would be so easy to get back here.
[63:57.22]I think it's time to be a coward.
[64:05.81]Yeah, time to be a coward.
[64:14.25]Coward time.
[64:21.59]I have way, oh yeah, I could definitely level up.
[64:23.23]I'm gonna use like 11,000.
[64:35.07]One of these will do it.
[64:35.79]Actually, maybe three of them.
[64:44.03]And eight, a little more.
[64:54.86]Is that enough?
[64:56.66]It's probably eleven or twelve.
[64:59.26]Thirteen?
[65:02.45]Thirteen?
[65:03.85]What?
[65:20.47]And then one more of these.
[65:22.75]Look at that perfect calculation.
[65:24.15]13,196.
[65:25.71]I will have zero souls left.
[65:52.29]Kill these guys and that's it.
[66:20.85]That's a huge knockback, too.
[66:30.48]Alright, let's go.
[66:32.20]Level up.
[66:34.08]Kill one of these guys with your eyes closed.
[66:35.70]Fine.
[66:38.82]Ready?
[67:00.96]What do I want to put the point into?
[67:02.06]Mind, probably, I said, right?
[67:03.48]Mind.
[67:04.88]Yes, I do.
[67:08.26]20 mind gets us our friend Oleg, finally.
[67:12.69]You can dual wield the spears.
[67:15.25]That's actually pretty fucking crazy.
[67:18.63]Alright, we'll be good.
[67:19.79]I got two, one, I, uh, we'll see.
[67:23.27]Need to upgrade the boys.
[67:25.93]Actually, I was talking to Holly last night.
[67:27.23]I was like, man, I don't, I really don't know what to do.
[67:30.82]Because, like, if I don't get the boys to plus ten, everyone's going to be fucking pissed.
[67:35.28]And, like, it's, like, they're going to be mad at me for not doing that.
[67:38.40]What if, like, Oleg's not that good?
[67:39.70]And what if that is the right play?
[67:41.10]I was like, I don't know.
[67:43.70]I wonder what I should do.
[67:47.80]Like, if I don't upgrade the boys to at least, like, plus five, then I'll never hear the end of it.
[67:53.52]It'll be, like, a meme on the channel for, like, another three years.
[67:55.86]A little bit of speed.
[68:01.60]It's so fun.
[68:07.80]Can I get up here?
[68:09.22]Just look at that.
[68:09.68]There's, like, a huge, there's, like, a giant sparkling item over there.
[68:15.81]I can definitely get up there from here.
[68:19.93]Absolutely.
[68:20.63]No doubt in my mind.
[68:23.02]Can I?
[68:28.76]Maybe I can.
[68:30.24]That was just the Earth exploding sound from Rabooie.
[68:42.33]It was actually that sound.
[68:46.42]Yeah, okay.
[69:02.31]Okay, not bad.
[69:03.41]He's gonna explode.
[69:04.31]Do it.
[69:05.63]Do it.
[69:36.75]Watch out for the little bubbles!
[69:45.32]Alright, what happened?
[69:47.94]Here we go.
[69:49.24]Okay, throwing dagger.
[69:55.43]Now, wait.
[69:59.45]Dropping down here gets me that.
[70:03.51]Oh, okay.
[70:04.07]I gotta be careful.
[70:05.39]There's a ledge here though.
[70:07.41]Wait, I'm not done exploring.
[70:12.69]Because there's an air to go over here too.
[70:15.09]Oh god, alright.
[70:15.97]Can I make that jump?
[70:33.48]I can't make this jump.
[70:34.37]Wait.
[70:36.17]What was the point of that?
[70:58.14]Nothing over here?
[70:58.80]Really?
[70:59.02]Why would they have a jump here?
[71:04.78]Oh, come on.
[71:05.24]Really?
[71:05.70]No, there's got to be something.
[71:13.79]I guess not.
[71:21.93]Let's drop here.
[71:23.97]Right there.
[71:24.39]Okay, I got to be careful.
[71:41.61]Oh, the bubbles.
[71:42.39]That's the bubble spell.
[71:46.11]The bubble spell.
[71:48.36]That thing looked like it was a piece of shit, though.
[71:54.72]I need arcane?
[71:58.80]There's several small magical bubbles that drift towards foes before they naturally pop.
[72:06.83]I'm not going to do Arcane.
[72:11.49]That's cool.
[72:15.53]Um... I wonder if I should be putting any points into Arcane at all.
[72:26.07]How come there's... Wait.
[72:27.81]Why do the runes respawn?
[72:31.50]The items respawn down here?
[72:34.84]Did I just not pick that one up?
[72:40.10]Will Diablo 4 be the Elden Ring of Diablo II?
[72:47.40]No.
[72:47.70]I don't think a chance in hell.
[72:48.72]I'm sorry, if I'm honest.
[72:57.03]Arcane is luck.
[73:10.60]Look up, Jermo, look up!
[73:12.34]Whoa, what the fuck?
[73:13.36]There's like... There's an arc here!
[73:15.76]There's one of these, like, arc buildings!
[73:32.48]Is that a map?
[73:34.96]Wait, how far am I going here?
[73:36.28]I'm going, like, on... Where am I?
[73:37.82]Okay.
[73:47.07]Alright, there's bugs here.
[73:52.70]Just checking, you never know.
[74:04.69]Preserving boluses.
[74:09.63]Holy sh- fuck, sorcery falls off hard later on.
[74:14.74]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[74:15.82]That's why I gotta make sure I'm prepared, and that I have enough, like, dex and other shit, and I have, like, an int scaling weapon, like this, to make sure that I can complete the video game.
[74:26.63]And those people that were saying that I'm a- I'm a noob!
[74:32.64]I saw a bunch of people called me Noob Saibot, and it was not making me happy, and I'm giving you the reason why.
[74:40.85]Oh, I had a dream.
[74:41.41]This is perfect.
[74:42.04]Okay.
[74:42.32]Perfect opportunity.
[74:43.62]I had a dream last night.
[74:44.66]Let me explain this.
[74:46.56]So, in the dream, I was, like, walking around.
[74:49.40]I think it was, like, my apartment or my house or whatever.
[74:52.58]Like, I was just in, like, an apartment or something.
[74:55.08]And it was this little crab.
[74:58.54]Like this.
[74:59.40]Tiny, tiny, tiny.
[75:01.12]And it was just... It was as big as, I would say, not as big as a tarantula, but a lot bigger than a house spider.
[75:09.71]It was, like...
[75:12.18]It was as big as a crab.
[75:12.90]Uh, so this was a crab, like a small crab, and it was just kind of walking around, little, just like, walking around, and it had a, like, what looked like a stick in its hand.
[75:26.09]It had this long, like, almost sharpened stick, and it was just kind of, like, walking around, holding it, and there was, like, a little, tiny, little shield that was, I would say, maybe a foot or two away from where the crab was.
[75:40.20]So it's holding like a little sharpened stick, walking around, and there was like three or four other people in this house, and we were like, what the fuck is going on here?
[75:47.03]Holy shit.
[75:47.77]You see what's in your house?
[75:48.63]I don't think we were in my place.
[75:49.99]We were in somebody else's.
[75:50.57]I don't even know who these people were.
[75:52.21]So it's like, dude, what the fuck is going on?
[75:53.59]This is crazy.
[75:54.55]And this crab kind of goes over it, picks up this little tiny shield.
[75:59.02]It's like, what's going on?
[75:59.70]This is like, get a camera.
[76:00.86]Somebody get a fucking camera or something.
[76:02.90]And in like the distance was another little crab that had the same items.
[76:11.41]and they like started to go towards each other and it was like what the fuck they're gonna fight they're gonna like it's gonna be like a sword fight they get close enough where they just barely start to like whack at each other
[76:24.49]And I don't know if this is, like, the person's dog that owned this place, but this big golden retriever just, like, runs over and, like, starts, like, fucking biting and, like, biting them and shit and freaking out.
[76:36.60]And the whole house was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, get the dog, get the dog.
[76:40.44]Like, it sprinted over and started to, like, go after them, like, kind of sniff, bite, bite, sniff, sniff.
[76:45.64]Like, it was just, like, you know how dogs are, right?
[76:47.72]It's just something, like, a little bug or something sometimes.
[76:50.22]And it was like, get the dog, what the fuck is happening?
[76:53.33]it was chaos it was absolute chaos like this golden retriever like literally was not even in my field of view and it like slid into frame like it's paused it was like it just started freaking out and it was like such panic and such chaos because it was like I don't
[77:10.87]But they have, like, sharpened stuff.
[77:12.35]We don't want the dog to get fucking hurt.
[77:13.94]Like, I didn't even know you had a dog.
[77:15.60]Like, it was crazy.
[77:17.00]And then I woke up.
[77:18.22]It was just absolute mayhem for, like, five seconds.
[77:21.43]And then it, uh...
[77:38.47]Dude you have why are you having viral video dreams?
[77:51.71]Yeah, that's just like something crazy that would be like on like tick-tock for ten seconds Oh Dude there's like this weird bug here dog No
[78:08.43]Only in my version, they had weapons, so it was scarier.
[78:13.07]You're having Zoomer humor dreams.
[78:20.19]Yeah, because everybody was, like, yelling, No, put it down!
[78:22.79]Drop it!
[78:23.29]Drop it!
[78:23.73]Like, don't do that!
[78:25.23]And I think, I think he, like, was just, I don't know.
[78:27.58]I couldn't even tell what was happening.
[78:28.64]It was just chaos.
[78:37.98]Oh...
[78:40.87]It was so weird.
[78:41.37]Like, they were going to go fight each other.
[78:42.85]Like, I think it was because of the crabs in the game.
[78:46.09]Don't ask me why.
[78:46.85]Like, I had... I mean, I know why I had, like, a Dark Souls dream.
[78:50.09]This one was way more impressive.
[79:05.54]Yeah, I know why I'm having, like, weird, like, Sword and Shield Dark Souls dreams.
[79:09.92]It's because of this.
[79:11.69]Don't ask me where the Golden Retriever came from.
[79:18.99]And it was one of those Golden Retrievers that was, like, super big and a little chunky.
[79:23.96]Tons of hair, like, that, like, kind of, that golden hair.
[79:27.90]It was that kind of chunky and, like, big.
[79:46.65]Crab eggs.
[79:47.29]Alright.
[79:47.97]So what is going on over here?
[79:49.15]This is kind of... This is a long little area.
[79:52.82]No map.
[79:54.12]Which, because it's a dungeon, why would there be a map?
[80:14.98]okay map right there see ask and ye shall receive oh my god what the hell is this wait why there's a map down here how big is this place there's another bonfire
[80:50.04]This is ridiculous.
[80:51.93]Okay, so... Where the hell am I?
[80:59.07]How did I... I don't even know how I got here.
[81:05.15]Light the flame.
[81:06.05]Okay, that's not a map, though.
[81:18.65]Maybe I have to light up a bunch of beacons or something?
[81:23.48]Okay, well, never mind.
[81:24.46]Alright, we got this way, that way, that way.
[81:36.00]I'm gonna go this way.
[81:41.86]This place is huge.
[81:43.94]Let's go left.
[81:47.51]That's not funny, what you just did.
[81:48.79]It's annoying.
[81:52.83]I know that, like, Elden Ring, all the FromSoftware games, they're pure comedy games.
[81:56.51]What you just did didn't make me laugh.
[81:57.71]It made me angry.
[81:59.07]Get away from me.
[82:04.98]What the f- Alright, hold on.
[82:06.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[82:06.90]Who is this?
[82:15.38]This guy doesn't seem to care.
[82:16.34]I'm waiting for you to get out of the way.
[82:17.97]Is this like an NPC?
[82:18.91]Why does this guy not care that I'm here?
[82:26.31]Barbarian?
[82:37.73]Okay.
[82:37.93]That guy was just collecting bevels.
[82:41.97]Why did you... Get away!
[82:43.37]Just leave me alone.
[82:43.99]I don't want to fight that thing.
[82:48.56]Oh, it's a... It's a fun!
[82:53.22]Come here.
[82:55.42]Maybe it'll eat out of my hand.
[83:13.13]Long wind up, motherfucker.
[83:16.86]Long wind-up.
[83:17.50]I got long winds-ups.
[83:19.27]I'm back against a tree.
[83:23.23]Get rid of it!
[83:23.69]Damn it!
[83:27.33]I'm looking up his ass!
[83:28.91]The camera's just pointed directly in his ass!
[83:32.81]Like, get me the fuck away from him!
[83:51.59]Alright, let's go.
[84:16.57]Okay, I'm glad I did that.
[84:44.24]Okay, like, how many fucking times in a row do these guys swing?
[84:47.70]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[84:57.62]Okay, now play the game.
[84:58.66]Now fight me.
[85:20.41]I wanna kill this thing so bad now.
[85:22.13]Fuck you.
[85:24.13]You're just in the fucking way.
[85:27.64]These crabs, seriously.
[85:28.72]It's like, why are there so many crabs in Elden Ring?
[85:34.50]There's huge crabs everywhere.
[85:36.58]They're in every area.
[85:39.38]We're down in this downtown magical fucking Disney Hades area.
[85:44.64]And there's seafood here?
[85:46.30]What?
[85:47.88]What?
[86:08.65]Okay.
[86:09.23]Get off the horse.
[86:09.93]I'm not... Let's go.
[86:11.81]Give me a break.
[86:14.97]Not playing around here.
[86:16.73]There's a guy over... I got collapsed on.
[86:19.16]That's what happened.
[86:20.56]Let's not get collapsed on.
[86:26.74]And there he is.
[86:27.34]Okay, so this is a problem.
[86:45.87]There.
[86:49.05]Mad because crab.
[86:50.11]Mad because crab.
[86:51.03]Mad because crab.
[86:53.95]There's crabs everywhere.
[87:03.65]They might just spawn.
[87:05.13]Maybe they just show up.
[87:08.17]They do.
[87:08.70]Okay.
[87:09.06]I was wondering, like, what the fuck is happening?
[87:14.36]Oh, there's a beacon here.
[87:33.17]Get out of the way.
[87:34.75]Iggs.
[87:36.07]Whatever you are.
[87:36.63]Got this too.
[87:47.08]I wish you could pet the animals.
[87:48.43]Don't you think that'd be kind of funny?
[87:51.13]If you could like... Who's that?
[87:57.25]Like if you could go up and just be like...
[88:08.89]And it gave you plus one resolve.
[88:09.97]Okay, so I got that one and got this one.
[88:15.17]I'm going to go to the right side now.
[88:19.91]Dear Boars, you're a genuine American pleb.
[88:24.01]I was going to say warthog, but pig was less syllables.
[88:27.01]And I was angry, so that's why I said it.
[88:35.80]Too early.
[88:36.28]Too early.
[88:51.97]Stop picking your nose and play!
[89:20.98]Alright.
[89:22.90]What do we got?
[89:25.56]What do we got over here?
[89:27.64]A... Armorer's Cookbook.
[89:29.90]I have... Look at this.
[89:32.96]This is... This is ridiculous.
[89:34.71]Uh, like, am I ever going to sit down and craft a single item in Eldritch?
[89:42.09]I have 117 of these.
[89:42.57]I have... I mean, what am I doing?
[89:50.85]Look at all these cookbooks.
[89:56.37]I'm not even doing it.
[89:58.49]Just make soap from all of them.
[90:08.88]You're holding it just in case.
[90:10.34]That's kind of how it feels like.
[90:11.40]Alright, I've already been... I've been...
[90:19.38]I've been down there, right?
[90:21.01]I don't know.
[90:21.43]Have I?
[90:21.79]That's where I started, right?
[90:23.67]Yeah.
[90:26.47]Okay, so I got these fires lit.
[90:38.79]That one.
[90:39.13]I got the one on the left.
[90:39.97]We're going to go right.
[90:41.49]And see if I can't.
[90:42.67]And actually, you know what?
[90:43.31]Let's rest at the bloom file.
[90:44.27]Because I don't care about those enemies over there respawning.
[90:47.82]Why would I care?
[90:58.21]Alright.
[90:59.15]Let's go light the one on the right.
[91:01.87]Craft from the pause menu.
[91:08.07]Um... Blood loss?
[91:12.24]I can make... I can make 12 of these.
[91:14.38]Temporarily boost fire damage negation.
[91:21.30]I can make... 4 of these?
[91:27.42]I can make fire pots.
[91:28.88]What's even useful?
[91:32.46]Can I make a cloud?
[91:36.77]What would even be useful?
[91:37.95]Maybe this?
[91:38.37]I feel like maybe this would be useful at some point.
[91:43.67]Maybe one of these?
[91:44.23]Fire, yeah.
[91:48.63]Can I even coat my weapon because it's magic?
[91:56.12]Use the cookbooks.
[91:58.04]Can I use them for my inventory?
[92:10.89]I can't use them from here.
[92:11.59]Do I have to turn them in?
[92:17.97]I think they're just there.
[92:18.57]They're just auto.
[92:20.80]Okay, well, I don't care.
[92:23.10]None of that stuff really is pressing for me to do right now.
[92:26.45]Look, if I fight a boss and it's like, oh wait, they're susceptible to fire damage.
[92:30.59]And by the way, they do fire damage.
[92:32.05]Watch out.
[92:32.47]I can make like a hundred of them.
[92:37.00]Map.
[92:43.42]What?
[92:46.55]Why is there another game underneath the game?
[92:54.54]They made Elden Ring, and then they said, oh, you know what?
[92:57.42]Um... Yeah, we should make, like, a whole nother video game.
[93:00.76]We're out of room on the map, though.
[93:02.02]That's okay, just put the whole thing underground.
[93:04.25]So there'd have to be two levels.
[93:05.27]Like, one under sea level, like, whole entire video game, and then one above sea level.
[93:09.29]How did they make this?
[93:10.21]How did they make this game?
[93:11.39]Do they have, like, 12,000 employees?
[93:14.27]How is this possible?
[93:16.58]They hid Dark Souls 4 in Elden Ring!
[93:22.11]Imagine an announcement like that.
[93:23.49]Oh, by the way, just wanted to let everybody know.
[93:25.93]We actually made Dark Souls 4, and we made it below sea level in Elden Ring.
[93:32.69]So yeah, there's a whole other story down here.
[93:34.57]It's just optional.
[93:35.57]You don't have to do it.
[93:36.59]Who cares?
[93:39.09]Jesus.
[93:40.06]Alright, I don't want to fight all these guys.
[93:41.22]I just want the item.
[93:49.14]Which, there it is.
[93:50.34]Yes, there it is.
[93:53.65]Arterial Leaf.
[93:57.36]Inverted Hawk Heater Shield.
[93:58.80]That's definitely an anti-fire shield.
[94:00.26]Okay, cool.
[94:03.30]I smell the item.
[94:03.82]There's no fire over here.
[94:07.16]Very cool.
[94:11.67]Hmm.
[94:19.33]Hmm.
[94:19.63]Hmm.
[94:31.28]The aggro.
[94:37.94]Okay.
[94:38.40]He's not behind me, right?
[94:40.10]He is.
[94:40.88]He's coming.
[94:42.34]He's got a bow?
[94:44.40]Will he shoot the bow or will he despawn?
[94:46.10]Leave me alone.
[94:47.14]I think I'm far enough away.
[94:50.21]Why are you so annoying today?
[94:51.27]I'm annoying every day.
[95:00.20]um okay he's gone I've been using this for I don't think I need to use this one anymore medium-sized metal shield easier to handle than a kite shield inverted hawk is an emblem of the company of slaves in order to explore the eternal city and it's parry how is it different from anything else though
[95:28.83]100, 100.
[95:28.87]It's a little more fire and a little more lightning, but that big of a deal considering that this is 58.
[95:38.28]This is not that great for fire or lightning, which I'm imagining we're probably not in the magic area right now, so maybe I'll just put it on.
[95:44.36]This is the best I have for fire besides this, but I can't wear this.
[95:54.56]Or maybe it's lightning.
[95:55.36]We'll find out.
[96:01.03]Alright, let's keep going.
[96:06.14]Halloween grounds.
[96:07.80]Hollow horn.
[96:22.71]What is that?
[96:23.29]Is that a...
[96:29.58]Is that a statue or is that alive?
[96:36.61]This thing is definitely alive.
[96:37.97]Maybe it's not.
[96:54.56]I ha- Okay, I got a theory.
[96:56.62]My theory is, you light all the fires, and then you come back up here, and it stands up.
[97:02.91]And then you fight it.
[97:05.49]That's the theory I'm going with, so that's what we're doing.
[97:14.43]Yeah, yep, look at this, yep.
[97:16.20]One, two, how many are there?
[97:18.90]I lit two.
[97:19.80]One, two, three, four, five, there's six more to light?! !
[97:25.95]If it goes by that theory, then damn, alright.
[97:28.45]Well, we got a lot to look at.
[97:37.28]Looking for that stuff to light.
[97:47.00]Help.
[97:47.52]Goodbye.
[97:50.46]I see a fire over there.
[97:53.43]Your aim is unmatched and it annoys me.
[98:02.63]Oh, it's just the Mario thing.
[98:05.95]There's a Mario 64 thing.
[98:07.05]Let's try it.
[98:08.85]Woooah!
[98:17.72]What?
[98:17.90]I've never used one of these!
[98:19.30]What?!
[98:19.66]How does this work?
[98:21.80]What happened?
[98:23.00]I've never used one.
[98:25.00]What was that?
[98:25.70]That just was fucking stupid.
[98:40.39]I didn't think it was going to go that high.
[98:41.71]That was too high.
[98:47.59]You were facing the wrong way?
[98:48.83]I mean, I thought that those things were automatic.
[98:52.69]I thought it was like, oh, go here, hit jump, and it will put you... I didn't think I had to actually steer the thing.
[98:57.01]Like, I was on a wingsuit.
[99:19.53]Urinal activated.
[99:21.89]In real life, I felt that in real life.
[99:28.49]Okay.
[99:33.09]So, how does this work?
[99:34.67]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[99:37.17]Be careful!
[99:38.39]Be careful!
[99:38.95]No!
[99:46.05]Oh!
[99:50.66]You're going too close to the edge!
[99:54.48]Be careful!
[99:58.44]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[100:01.30]Okay, that would have been so sad, but I think everybody would have left.
[100:05.32]I would have been one of them.
[100:15.07]How do I activate this?
[100:21.01]Jump.
[100:30.39]Dude, this is ridiculous.
[100:32.27]I'm in like another dimension.
[100:34.41]Glove wart.
[100:40.70]Yep.
[100:42.28]The more glove wart I get, the more that there's a chance that the boys get to plus 10.
[100:45.10]Ugh.
[100:59.16]I'm just seeing if there's something down there that might be... Whatever.
[101:03.52]That's playthrough number two.
[101:12.34]What was the point?
[101:14.88]Nice.
[101:15.88]Actually worth.
[101:16.36]Is there binoculars in this game?
[101:41.49]Where are they?
[101:52.26]It's an invisible bridge.
[101:54.34]Oh.
[101:55.32]I'm sure there is.
[101:58.00]Oh, it's an invisible bridge.
[101:59.16]Thanks, guys.
[101:59.72]I appreciate the help.
[102:02.78]Like, it's an invisible bridge.
[102:03.88]You can walk over this.
[102:05.02]That's great.
[102:06.20]Really good idea.
[102:08.32]That's very funny.
[102:10.48]Even if it's true, I don't believe you.
[102:17.68]I fucking can't believe I live.
[102:18.90]Why would I do that?
[102:19.68]I can't believe it.
[102:28.13]I figured, like, maybe everyone just spoiled that for me, and like, okay, whatever, we'll just go?
[102:37.32]Everybody in this chat needs to understand, if I didn't do that for the next 40 straight minutes, as long as it takes me to clean up in the morning, right?
[102:46.23]We would be hearing, back to the bridge, back to the bridge.
[102:49.71]Oh, bridge boys, rise up.
[102:52.45]Bridge crew, hey, invisible bridge crew.
[102:55.29]That would have been, it would have been like an hour.
[102:57.58]I'm just getting in front of that.
[103:04.20]I have to go back up there, though.
[103:10.53]Don't kill me.
[103:13.95]Bridge boys.
[103:15.13]Oh, bridge crew.
[103:16.05]That guy shot an arrow like five minutes ago and it actually just ended up hitting me.
[103:23.69]But how do I get in the middle?
[103:29.21]Okay, I'm gonna do something really weird here.
[103:34.08]How do I get down from here?
[103:41.26]How am I supposed to get down?
[103:44.95]I want to try to go in the middle area where there's an item.
[103:52.79]Can I jump into the stream of air?
[103:54.51]I mean, theoretically that should work, right?
[103:56.62]But it might not.
[103:57.44]Let's try it.
[104:01.56]Wait, I can't get back over there.
[104:04.78]How am I going to get back?
[104:08.74]Can I jump over there?
[104:11.38]Holy fuck, I almost didn't.
[104:12.88]Alright, so... I wanna go in the middle.
[104:22.87]This is not gonna work.
[104:33.95]Where am I going?
[104:37.70]I'm fine.
[104:43.41]What?!
[104:43.81]I just wanna go like this.
[104:56.80]My own head just...
[105:04.86]I was literally on purpose.
[105:05.81]It was on purpose.
[105:07.77]Because I purposefully thought that I could make it down there without dying.
[105:12.64]It was on purpose.
[105:14.24]It was purpose behind it.
[105:15.44]You've got that first part right.
[105:30.51]Okay.
[105:32.15]Where are they?
[105:32.63]Are they up there?
[105:33.24]Of course they're fucking up there.
[105:34.94]Why do they have to be up there?
[105:37.50]OH MY GOD!
[105:38.52]The game just ran forward and I just like, fucking freaked out.
[105:45.27]Do I actually have to jump up there?
[105:46.45]That's so annoying.
[105:48.75]It should be where you land, not where you jump from.
[105:59.46]Okay, let's try this now.
[106:10.04]Is that a person?
[106:11.88]No.
[106:13.74]Looks like a guy with a cloak on.
[106:14.78]Alright, let me see if I can get in there from here.
[106:20.52]That doesn't kill you, right?
[106:21.70]No.
[106:24.15]I want to... This is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[106:27.13]Can I get in there from here if I just jump and then move forward at the very last second?
[106:30.49]You know what I'm saying?
[106:31.93]Like... No.
[106:33.71]Wait.
[106:34.03]What if I do this?
[106:40.71]Wait, it was the jump!
[106:41.45]I couldn't jump.
[106:42.22]Why could I not double jump?
[106:45.90]I was trying to double jump into that.
[106:51.73]I didn't get my second- I didn't get to get the jump.
[106:55.85]I was gonna fall, jump, like double jump into the middle.
[106:59.65]You fell, you didn't jump.
[107:00.81]You can do it still.
[107:02.58]You can only double jump after jumping.
[107:04.44]What?
[107:11.06]You have to jump to double jump.
[107:13.24]Really though?
[107:14.02]I- do I?
[107:14.58]I feel like I've done that before a few times.
[107:17.19]Hold on, let me prove chat wrong.
[107:21.04]Wrong, by the way.
[107:25.69]Wrong, by the way.
[107:32.87]Debunked.
[107:38.86]Why are you joke farming?
[107:40.78]I want to get in there.
[107:43.48]I'm not farming jokes.
[107:45.66]I'm farming items and souls in the game.
[108:00.09]Sometimes I wish I could just jump and like Yoshi this horse and like get further Can I jump from the other side find out
[108:20.79]Is there a ledge like here or something that I can get on?
[108:24.99]It kind of looks like it.
[108:27.31]What about here?
[108:39.23]Alright, what happens if I do this?
[108:40.47]Get off the horse.
[108:46.07]This is going to be a nightmare.
[109:15.69]Wait, I might have to jump.
[109:20.62]Remind me to check that if I need to.
[109:25.14]Oh shit, I need to jump from the horse.
[109:27.30]I have to horse jump over there.
[109:40.45]Too far?
[109:43.01]No, I gotta horse jump over there.
[109:44.29]That's the only way.
[109:46.05]I could've dropped... Wait, what?
[109:51.29]No, it is the only way, isn't it?
[109:52.49]That would've been so funny.
[110:05.82]That would've been fucking hilarious.
[110:07.34]Because I would've missed it and freaked out because it was right here.
[110:16.47]Alright, there it is.
[110:17.27]So all this time and all this energy, what was it for?
[110:21.09]Ooh, cool.
[110:21.91]Like bone arrows with fucking goo on them.
[110:24.94]I'm glad I did all that.
[110:33.84]What?
[110:34.10]There might be more.
[110:34.64]There's not.
[110:40.80]Now, somebody that is playing an archer build might go, holy shit, nice!
[110:57.03]But that's not me.
[111:08.56]Okay.
[111:09.88]I'm going to go that way.
[111:12.78]Can I skip that?
[111:14.32]If I just go there and jump across the whole thing, does that work?
[111:17.96]I would imagine it does, and I'm probably going to get laughed at when it doesn't.
[111:27.22]I mean, it might work.
[111:30.64]No, it's not going to work.
[111:34.00]Why would I do that?
[111:34.52]I can literally go right here.
[111:40.66]All the bulls.
[111:43.46]Some eagles.
[111:44.04]Is he just hanging out?
[111:49.60]I don't think so.
[111:52.39]I'm on a horse this time, idiot.
[111:53.61]Alright, there's another fire.
[112:11.70]Nice pop-in.
[112:13.22]Oh, great pop-in gameplay.
[112:19.22]These fucking arrows.
[112:20.14]Alright, well, dude, alright.
[112:23.50]I'm- this is ridiculous.
[112:24.79]There's so many people here.
[112:26.07]How am I supposed to handle this?
[112:32.77]This is ridiculous.
[112:33.63]What?
[112:33.89]There's no way.
[112:37.01]I think I just have to get off and run?
[112:47.46]It's gonna be worth a lot of souls if I can kill it.
[112:49.10]Oh, and you have magicians, too.
[112:52.37]So there's magicians, axe wielders, sorcerers...
[113:19.79]Take out the archers first.
[113:21.47]Anybody that has like magic can get rid of them too.
[113:32.84]Nice entrance.
[113:49.07]What happened to my horse?
[113:49.83]What did... What did... What happened?
[113:51.93]What?
[113:52.13]They like staggered the horse?
[114:01.00]Why are there like... 15 of you here?
[114:07.88]That was going really well.
[114:08.94]It was!
[114:09.42]Until like somebody just... And like somebody hits the fucking horse's leg and then you get the... Gong sound and you fall down.
[114:37.52]Just, I'm just going up there and doing it.
[114:39.96]Is there really a need to fight, like, 30 people here?
[114:46.37]Um, okay.
[114:57.79]No!
[115:14.60]Alright, that's that one.
[115:15.48]I'm gonna wrap around this edge.
[115:24.11]You piece of shit.
[115:30.17]Where are you doing that?
[115:37.89]Okay, give me a second.
[115:39.73]Should I pull these out?
[115:44.03]I don't know where that's coming from, but I need to kind of know before I start moving.
[116:09.00]Is somebody in a tree shooting me with these arrows?
[116:13.23]Where the fuck is this person?
[116:23.12]That guy was... I didn't even know.
[116:24.32]I couldn't even see him.
[116:26.72]Sniper on the hill.
[116:27.74]Alright.
[116:37.39]Nice Minecraft arrows.
[116:40.66]Run towards the arrow.
[116:41.54]That's a good idea.
[116:43.97]I don't even know where the guy was.
[116:45.33]He could have been behind me for all I knew.
[117:01.10]Okay, this is where I died.
[117:02.34]This is the bullshit here.
[117:05.14]That's where that was.
[117:06.14]Okay, let's get this.
[117:10.08]Get my body.
[117:14.86]What was that?
[117:29.09]Fuck you guys!
[117:30.23]Why?
[117:35.49]Stupid animal!
[117:36.97]Get out of the way!
[117:39.33]Where are my souls?
[117:40.29]Hey, there.
[117:48.11]Hey, alright.
[117:48.93]Not a stupid animal.
[117:50.67]Okay, alright.
[117:51.73]I know.
[117:52.19]That was rude.
[117:53.65]I have to get off the horse.
[117:59.44]And just, like, fight the people, right?
[118:01.60]Because, like, they're gonna keep doing this shit.
[118:07.15]I mean, or like, honest to God, like, what the fuck, man?
[118:14.31]Just like, like, they're not going to stop.
[118:15.72]They're going to keep spawning on you until you've had it.
[118:18.28]There's another one right here.
[118:29.96]Okay, sure.
[118:34.33]Did that come back?
[118:35.45]Is that just like a defense mechanism for the tower?
[118:37.45]I don't... That's probably gonna hurt a lot.
[118:53.64]That one.
[118:54.04]This one.
[118:54.44]I'm going to just do a big circle.
[118:58.62]Because... Just do the perimeter.
[119:03.02]There's probably another one or two around the perimeter.
[119:04.66]There's a bonfire there, which is good.
[119:14.90]This is so huge.
[119:16.12]Alright.
[119:20.00]Bonfire.
[119:20.44]That's good.
[119:22.43]I'll take it.
[119:34.47]You see the clip of you twerking during the VR stream?
[119:36.61]I lived it.
[119:37.15]Alright.
[119:49.08]I can go up there.
[119:51.72]But I'm into the... I'm trying to light these fires here.
[119:54.91]So we're going to light the fires and blink a bunch of times because my eyes need to be moisturized.
[120:05.90]I'm looking for fires.
[120:10.70]There's something all the way down here, but I think this might be going too far.
[120:13.00]I think that's too far.
[120:18.71]I don't think they would put them that far away.
[120:21.87]Although, what the hell do I know?
[120:47.61]That's a backstab if I ever see him.
[121:23.24]Okay.
[121:25.00]I'm going to assume there's probably one or two more down this way, and then we can go fight that boss in the middle.
[121:32.29]That's probably optional, but let's do it.
[121:34.23]Why not?
[121:34.63]Okay.
[121:46.77]I probably have enough to upgrade my weapon.
[121:51.50]We'll see.
[121:51.88]Feels like you're the baddie because those monsters are just living peacefully with the wildlife.
[122:17.32]I love it when games and media play with your moral compass.
[122:21.43]It's kind of true though.
[122:46.48]It's a very pretty area.
[122:47.64]Did someone just try to hit me with an arrow?
[122:52.26]Sounded like it.
[122:52.74]Okay.
[122:58.51]What is over there?
[123:01.11]Weird.
[123:02.15]Some weird shit over there.
[123:06.67]Runes.
[123:10.25]Waterfall.
[123:26.22]oh it's one of those weird beaked snake animal features um
[123:44.51]Are they playing music?
[124:09.99]Alright, do, do patches right now in your room, wherever you are, and just tell me, and you're gonna say, ah, that's Stewie Griffin.
[124:19.59]And that wasn't even close to being Stewie Griffin.
[124:21.02]Alright, I'm just going down, this is weird.
[124:22.40]There's, uh, somebody playing music.
[124:23.86]I'm very interested.
[124:34.38]Whoa.
[124:48.53]Is that a bow and arrow that he's playing?
[124:51.92]I'm not going to interrupt the song.
[125:09.61]Oh, a customer.
[125:14.65]Customer.
[125:15.49]Cookbook.
[125:21.22]A bunch of cookbooks.
[125:25.42]Oh, man.
[125:25.82]Look at all the keys he has.
[125:29.86]I want those.
[125:31.34]And I'll get this, too.
[125:33.77]Really cool.
[125:38.80]Do I have anything that's expensive that I just don't give a shit about?
[125:47.85]Not really.
[125:49.37]Maybe some of the weapons.
[125:53.43]Well, we know I'm not using the, uh... ...short sword.
[125:56.94]It's not gonna happen.
[126:00.25]I'm not going to use this dagger.
[126:02.15]No, I have the cool daggers if I ever wanted to use them for any reason.
[126:05.37]I'm not going to use... Wait, what if I dual-wielded it?
[126:07.79]Could be.
[126:08.93]This thing, no, it's Faith.
[126:10.21]I'm sorry, it's Firehound of Souls.
[126:11.37]Goodbye.
[126:16.89]Alright, same thing with these crossbows.
[126:18.49]No, I'm not going to use them.
[126:20.33]I'll keep that just because it's fun to have.
[126:24.45]Some of these shields might be good in certain situations.
[126:27.19]Let's see.
[126:29.56]Yeah, you never throw away armor.
[126:32.00]Ever.
[126:32.72]Because it just randomly has use that you just don't know about.
[126:35.96]In fact, I got a couple new things I want to look at.
[126:37.46]Although, I don't need two.
[126:53.24]Okay.
[126:53.44]How do you pronounce wield?
[126:57.34]Like that, wield.
[127:01.31]Okay, so I can afford... I'm just going to come back and buy the other key.
[127:13.13]Those are cheap.
[127:15.14]Those are really cheap.
[127:21.52]Um...
[127:47.63]I was seeing if anything was behind him.
[128:00.73]I'm not fighting that.
[128:02.15]I'm just looking for the thing to turn on.
[128:04.90]There was one over here I missed, didn't I?
[128:12.42]Oh, yes.
[128:13.38]Hellblah.
[128:17.15]That's my favorite character in every Souls game, by the way.
[128:20.25]I wish they gave that guy way more screen time.
[128:23.13]I love that guy.
[128:23.67]He needed five times more screen time.
[129:02.65]That one right there?
[129:06.63]Can't tell.
[129:07.07]Wait!
[129:11.75]Buying those tears will let you upgrade the blast?
[129:14.57]Really?
[129:16.70]Are you bullshitting me?
[129:17.92]Are you shitting me for content?
[129:32.28]Should be one more.
[129:36.38]Is that true?
[129:37.02]Because I'll go back up there.
[129:38.08]Because my flask is only at a plus one, which sounds like it's probably terrible right now.
[129:48.97]Get out of here.
[129:52.61]Tears are for respect.
[129:54.79]Let me go look at it.
[129:55.87]That's it.
[130:03.35]All signed and sealed.
[130:06.33]Oh, no.
[130:07.15]Don't worry.
[130:07.73]Whatever happens, you may think it all a mere bad dream.
[130:18.91]Alright, hey dude.
[130:28.91]I'm back.
[130:29.99]And I want to ask you a quick question about what do those tears do.
[130:34.73]Tyrael needed by Rennala to grant rebirth.
[130:45.95]You lied to me.
[130:58.97]Look up.
[131:00.09]There's nothing here!
[131:08.09]Different tiers for flasks.
[131:10.39]Yeah, you guys had... Now we gotta run through, like, the weird thing over here.
[131:19.54]No!
[131:20.26]Turn around!
[131:21.00]Damn it, it's too late.
[131:23.10]It's not too late.
[131:23.78]I'm going back up there, and I'll tell you why.
[131:26.06]I'm gonna crack a crunchy, because I want to buy that other key.
[131:30.36]I just forgot about it right there and then.
[131:34.88]Please don't fucking kill me.
[131:36.52]Like... Don't look up.
[131:53.77]Whatever.
[132:08.19]That tear lets you rebirth and change stats with the Moon Lady.
[132:10.61]Yeah.
[132:16.93]Why does he move around in the game like a panicked bug?
[132:26.98]Yeah, let's see how you move around when you're flying.
[132:30.24]Because I'll tell you right now, if you are not sitting there like this...
[132:36.65]the whole time you play, then hypocrite Andy.
[132:53.72]When a guy appears behind you, if you, okay, if I walk down this way and I don't know what's to my left, and a guy jumps out and attacks me, and I don't know he's there and it's a surprise, I'm not gonna go like this.
[133:16.26]No, you're gonna go like this!
[133:19.46]Even if you tried it, you're gonna go... Right?
[133:25.21]And then, like, everyone in the early friends are gonna laugh.
[133:32.20]Or you're at least gonna go... Or... You guys act like you have, like, balls of steel.
[133:40.34]Like, you're just, like...
[133:42.78]Nothing ever makes me emote.
[133:46.18]Ever.
[133:48.44]I am like a stone.
[133:50.66]Nothing.
[133:52.69]My courage precedes me.
[133:58.55]Always.
[134:00.59]Always.
[134:07.50]Hello again, good customer.
[134:12.06]The reason why I'm buying these is because they're the cheapest I've seen.
[134:15.94]Everywhere else, these are 4,000 or 5,000 gold.
[134:19.84]This guy's very reasonable.
[134:21.72]Can I just say?
[134:22.96]I like this guy.
[134:24.73]I actually want to meet up with this guy again.
[134:26.65]I want to be friends with this person.
[134:27.99]I don't want to just show up right here.
[134:29.79]That's a good price.
[134:31.97]That's a good price.
[134:33.39]I respect that guy.
[134:34.05]Alright, looking for the last...
[134:41.94]I think there's only one more.
[134:47.82]Dollars.
[134:48.44]Gold.
[134:51.28]Yeah, but it's a spendable currency.
[134:53.30]I'm going to call it like money, right?
[134:57.79]I'm going to call it money because it's money, whatever.
[135:00.55]It's money that you can use to spend on yourself.
[135:06.87]Okay, it turns out I was right.
[135:11.72]Because, are they all lit?
[135:14.43]No, two more need to be lit.
[135:17.91]Gotta find those last two.
[135:22.25]Straight up the middle.
[135:23.05]Maybe it is a little bit further out.
[135:28.50]Oh, god damn it.
[135:29.38]I'm not going in there yet.
[135:37.25]Not yet.
[135:42.55]Turtles.
[135:50.42]There are two more.
[135:55.22]I sensed it.
[136:13.75]You shouldn't even be shooting at me by now.
[136:17.38]How do you still have sight?
[136:18.84]How does this person still have sight on me?
[136:20.48]They're across the whole game.
[136:24.68]You're literally... You're across the entire map.
[136:27.38]You're across the entire zone. ...
[136:43.40]Stop running in a straight line?
[136:44.53]I'm running in a straight line because I feel like I'm far enough away where the guy can't shoot me with the boring arrow.
[136:49.55]Buddy?
[137:01.61]Wait, why is there one of these here?
[137:02.51]Oh, buddy.
[137:09.03]He's fuming.
[137:09.97]No, I'm fine.
[137:10.69]I'm just kidding.
[137:12.53]I think, yeah, it actually is further down.
[137:16.87]Like, it's probably down here.
[137:17.96]So, there's two more.
[137:21.08]Let's continue.
[137:46.04]Thank you.
[137:47.06]Are they glitched out?
[137:55.87]Are they stuck?
[138:01.80]Maybe stuck.
[138:35.56]That move actually is pretty good because with more dexterity that's gonna be even faster, so I actually don't hate that move.
[138:58.99]What are they doing?
[138:59.55]I wonder why they're doing that.
[139:07.77]Okay, well I gotta get that.
[139:16.34]They're stomping.
[139:17.18]But why?
[139:18.02]There's probably a reason why they're doing that.
[139:36.05]I don't want to get too overzealous and run off the edge.
[139:39.66]I should force square off.
[139:46.84]Another teleporter.
[139:47.74]Let's mark it.
[139:51.60]Are the teleporters marked on the map?
[139:54.56]They're not.
[140:01.01]They are not marked on the map.
[140:06.01]Okay, what's this place called?
[140:07.03]The river?
[140:07.33]What's this place called?
[140:10.83]I gotta clean this up.
[140:23.20]Uh... This guy... We already did this.
[140:28.91]Already did this.
[140:32.67]Ron guy still hates me.
[140:33.97]Alright, what about... Sea?
[140:36.83]What is it?
[140:37.57]Siof?
[140:38.17]Sofra?
[140:38.59]What's the place called?
[140:42.75]What's the place?
[140:43.15]Siofra Village?
[140:44.39]Okay, Siofra has two teleporters.
[140:54.16]Okay.
[140:59.94]Good.
[141:05.84]I'm not going to go in them now because I'm busy.
[141:10.08]I am what you would call very busy.
[141:12.46]Because I only have two more of these and then it's definitely a boss we fight.
[141:15.84]So sorry we're not going in there.
[141:17.32]And I have to pee too.
[141:18.28]So I'm doing that before the fight as well.
[141:27.15]These guys are like... Oh there's rats.
[141:32.69]Why are they just hanging out with them?
[141:54.97]Stop panic dodging before I scream!
[142:15.13]Alright, here's the... There's one more after this.
[142:17.53]I wanna check this out over here though.
[142:24.47]There's a place I can go up here.
[142:25.53]Is that it?
[142:32.39]There it is.
[142:34.43]That's the last one.
[142:37.24]I think we keep going this way though just for now because... There's a little ending over here.
[142:42.28]There's a little like observatory or something.
[142:51.37]What?
[142:53.23]I don't know if they're gonna shoot a fucking arrow at me, so that's why I'm freaking out.
[143:10.72]Who's that?
[143:14.99]What the hell are those?
[143:16.94]Why are the... Why were the sheeps rolling?
[143:19.30]Were they rolling around?
[143:20.46]That was weird.
[143:28.31]Why would they go... Why are they doing that?
[143:33.26]Sheep do that?
[143:44.57]He's got an item!
[143:51.53]Golden rune and a rune arc on a rat?
[143:54.27]Holy shit.
[143:54.77]Those are worth killing then.
[144:07.84]What's up there?
[144:16.12]Okay, we're at this ending here.
[144:22.62]The fire.
[144:23.10]Is this another boss?
[144:28.59]Right here?
[144:28.99]It's all underground.
[144:33.91]Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[144:36.73]Okay, well, there's definitely something right here.
[144:39.21]Why would there not be, right?
[144:42.15]That has to be a boss.
[144:44.51]Yeah, I can see like the lantern, whatever it is.
[144:46.07]Alright, let's go up there.
[144:49.02]Need to look down.
[144:49.84]Now we're doing look down spam.
[145:18.51]Pretty.
[145:20.33]Really pretty.
[145:31.65]Two triangles.
[145:32.34]What's the big deal?
[145:45.52]Camp abandoned.
[145:46.52]Okay, what is up with this?
[145:50.72]Let's check it out.
[145:52.12]Here we go.
[146:02.49]Clarifying Horn Charm.
[146:05.59]I have a third slot.
[146:10.11]Raises Focus?
[146:13.98]Wait.
[146:14.16]Wait.
[146:20.89]Oh, should I get the focus?
[146:21.71]What is that?
[146:22.11]What does that mean?
[146:24.51]Where is this focus?
[146:25.25]Is that mana?
[146:28.03]No.
[146:28.89]What is focus in this game?
[146:42.62]Resistance to sleep and bouts of madness.
[146:45.22]I already have a lot of that from intelligence, right?
[146:49.82]That's kind of cool.
[146:50.40]Alright, so what is it?
[146:51.10]What do you got?
[146:51.82]What is it?
[146:57.00]Oh.
[146:59.28]I can't go down here unless I spend the stone keys?
[147:06.18]Okay.
[147:10.57]I don't think I want to do that.
[147:12.75]I don't think I want to do that.
[147:17.19]I will mark this, though, because this is... Actually, I know where that is.
[147:20.47]I'll just... I'll make a note of it, though.
[147:44.48]There.
[147:50.97]It's not worth it.
[147:52.19]Well, we'll see.
[147:53.27]I'm not going to put it in because I have a few places I'd like to check out first.
[147:59.57]Alright, so there's that.
[148:00.45]That's cool.
[148:02.95]Let's actually go because that... Yeah, because now I got to light the last one.
[148:14.80]That last fire was back this way.
[148:31.25]Alright, rat.
[148:46.93]He's aiming at me, I think, still.
[149:18.32]Actually turns out this thing is really good for stuff like this.
[149:39.15]Got him.
[149:42.13]Cool.
[149:42.73]I got my flask filled up too.
[149:44.29]Thanks.
[149:44.89]Alright.
[149:45.27]Final thing.
[149:45.97]Light it up.
[149:46.55]Here we go.
[149:47.21]I want that.
[149:47.73]Whatever it is.
[149:48.25]I don't think I can get there yet.
[149:49.57]That's six.
[149:55.79]Power gathers somewhere in horned remains.
[150:04.35]Okay.
[150:04.49]Okay.
[150:11.84]How far away is that one?
[150:14.92]Like here, right?
[150:16.92]Like this thing here.
[150:18.66]This one.
[150:18.94]Time for a break.
[150:22.43]Yeah, I gotta go pee.
[150:23.73]I'm gonna go pee.
[150:24.17]I'm gonna refill my drink.
[150:27.47]And we will... I'll sit right here.
[150:30.12]We will be back and we will continue and we're going to fight whatever that thing is up there.
[150:33.28]I'll be right back.
[150:34.42]See you in a minute.
[151:15.04]you
[152:16.16]Thank you.
[153:51.17]Thank you.
[155:12.53]Thank you.
[155:43.10]Hey.
[155:44.68]Hey.
[155:46.09]What's up?
[155:56.91]Are you lean?
[155:58.94]Um.
[156:02.02]Maybe everywhere, but like the bottom of my stomach.
[156:05.88]It's kind of.
[156:07.42]I have like a big like stomach now.
[156:11.75]I think it just kind of happens after you turn, like, 35.
[156:13.27]I think it just does.
[156:14.33]I have, like, the dad stomach.
[156:23.05]Okay.
[156:24.73]I am ready.
[156:26.09]Turn.
[156:30.73]Elden Ring.
[156:33.85]Let's go.
[156:40.54]Uh, here's a question.
[156:42.90]Do I have enough?
[156:44.10]I probably do.
[156:45.18]Alright, here's what we're doing.
[156:47.83]Boom.
[156:54.71]That felt good.
[156:56.33]Boom.
[157:05.50]And, boom.
[157:06.46]Boom.
[157:13.51]Anybody has a screen frozen?
[157:14.87]Shouldn't be.
[157:21.50]Now, I only need a few more things, I think.
[157:27.16]Did your stream crash?
[157:28.38]No, I'm, look.
[157:30.22]I'm here.
[157:32.88]Where's the Burger King head from?
[157:33.94]Burger King head is from the Academy.
[157:36.48]It's like on a, I mean, I don't know if you find it here every time, but it was on like a crab or something.
[157:43.30]Alright, how much is it to level up?
[157:46.70]Alright, just gotta go kill one thing.
[157:51.49]And I'm gonna put it into... I'm gonna put it into... I wanna get to vigor to 20.
[157:58.13]I'm falling behind on health here.
[157:59.39]I need to start putting HP in.
[158:01.87]Let me just do that.
[158:02.57]8, that's it.
[158:06.18]Just need to kill something...
[158:17.54]Just spawn those guys.
[158:18.50]They spawn everywhere when I don't want them and now I don't know where they are.
[158:35.98]Backstab!
[158:45.85]Okay, I need... Get the 14,000.
[158:51.37]These potions are so bad.
[158:53.11]I need to find... I'm surprised I haven't found any more of those tears.
[158:57.30]I only have a plus one flask.
[158:59.90]I need to drink two potions.
[159:03.22]Heal.
[159:03.94]Bar.
[159:05.08]That's not good.
[159:05.86]I need to find more of those damn things.
[159:15.54]island to the south.
[159:18.14]I might have to do that sooner rather than later because I'm going to fall behind hard here.
[159:41.59]I'm just I just want to get souls quickly, and I'm just I'm counteracting whole point here There we go okay, uh one more should do it In fact, I probably just like these little like weird weasel things.
[160:03.22]I'm sorry.
[160:04.10]I'm I can't do it Looked at me it looked at me
[160:24.44]You've waited.
[160:25.10]I'm surprised with a level 3 that doesn't... Okay, that's enough.
[160:39.95]Putting it into health.
[160:41.41]And let's go to that... Weird animal statue.
[161:02.36]Let's move.
[161:05.94]This one's probably better.
[161:06.86]What class is this?
[161:10.18]I started with prisoner.
[161:12.96]Shito?
[161:15.06]Oh.
[161:18.34]Shito got down to say hello.
[161:20.62]Yeah, this is better.
[161:24.20]Rest of this one.
[161:35.59]I'm going to put on the boys.
[161:38.25]Just to see how they are here.
[161:43.09]And I'm also going to probably put... Yeah.
[161:56.70]I can't imagine that I'm going to be sitting there casting very many spells.
[161:59.50]Let's go.
[162:09.37]Here we go.
[162:12.29]All the beacons have been lit.
[162:14.44]Take a sip of my... You can drink whatever you want.
[162:17.86]I got matcha tea here.
[162:18.84]Let me go ahead and take a sip.
[162:22.88]Ah, some good matcha.
[162:26.78]Alright, here we go.
[162:27.22]Let's do it.
[162:28.14]I can be on the horse.
[162:28.96]Should I be on the horse?
[162:37.47]It's not... I can do it.
[162:44.45]I do.
[162:46.31]Touch.
[162:48.42]Oh, I can touch it.
[162:55.94]What the fuck?
[162:58.78]Oh, that is going to stand up.
[163:00.00]OK, so you touch the remains and then.
[163:06.66]Inside of his dream or something.
[163:13.30]Ancestor spirit.
[163:23.17]double jump one two and then land alright it's a fire no it's okay it's cool

[164:15.50]Oh, shit.
[164:15.98]Alright, that's two.
[164:24.52]Watch out.
[164:25.72]That's right on top of him.
[164:32.94]One, two.
[164:38.31]One, two.
[164:39.33]No, that's just ahead.
[164:47.15]Wow.
[164:49.41]This is so pretty.
[164:57.44]Okay, that's a... That goes... Come on.
[165:32.39]One, two, three, right?
[165:40.54]Oh, didn't do three.
[165:48.24]Ooh, nope.
[165:48.72]I wonder if this is phase two.
[165:50.12]This feels very phase two.
[165:54.99]Get stamina.
[166:17.56]Flying around.
[166:18.26]I like the way that looks, that lighting.
[166:38.47]Back up.
[166:43.91]Back up.
[167:08.74]That was really cool Ancestral follower ashes That wasn't too bad That was That was That was like a relaxing fight Ancestral follower ashes Cool And 10,000? 12,000?
[167:27.90]Cool.
[167:29.56]Lost to Jerma.
[167:30.74]Yeah, that one was good.
[167:34.70]Is there anything else I can do here?
[167:43.15]That summon is sick, too.
[167:44.85]Really.
[167:47.02]Ooh.
[167:48.90]Alright, anything else here?
[167:56.22]is that, but I don't want to miss anything.
[167:59.06]Will I miss something?
[168:00.78]Okay, so, just save me, like, the ten straight minutes it's going to take me to walk around in a circle.
[168:05.96]Do you guys even know?
[168:07.08]I don't think anyone would even know.
[168:10.44]Would anybody even know?
[168:14.62]That was really pretty.
[168:15.38]That was a nice, like, kind of change.
[168:18.72]From the... Like, smash my controller into a hundred pieces.
[168:22.75]That was just, like, nice.
[168:23.83]That was very enjoyable.
[168:25.89]Okay.
[168:33.05]antlers too like the magical dust that was I liked that one okay so now what I think I can there was one area that I couldn't it was like the gate right over here let me try going up the gate which would be going this way right here
[168:59.84]And then through this way.
[169:00.76]Because I can go over here.
[169:03.06]You can do the teleports.
[169:09.14]Let me check this out.
[169:10.86]I'm just going to run.
[169:11.34]I'm going to run from here.
[169:15.80]Why was everybody telling me to look up here and look down and look up?
[169:18.32]Was it just bullshit?
[169:24.25]I was literally just here.
[169:26.35]I got to level up again because I don't want to die.
[169:36.98]Nothing's so annoying.
[169:43.59]Bastard.
[169:49.47]Okay.
[169:49.63]Uh, what is it?
[169:54.80]15, 16,000 to level up again?
[170:07.73]Bend those souls on gummy bears.
[170:09.47]Alright, I want to go this way.
[170:14.03]Here.
[170:15.21]There's definitely going to be another fire.
[170:22.30]I think I have to be up, right?
[170:23.98]Because I'm all the way down.
[170:25.04]Yeah, I got to be way up.
[170:27.80]I'm at the wrong place.
[170:28.45]I got to go over here.
[170:37.51]I gotta go back like that way.
[170:38.63]Back when I was on all those things.
[170:40.75]Go over to the right.
[170:41.33]Maybe I should just go back here.
[170:50.63]And run from here through there.
[170:52.29]I need to get to this area.
[170:57.73]It doesn't matter.
[170:58.47]Like right in the middle.
[171:07.54]Hope you need a teleporter.
[171:08.46]You can't just walk.
[171:12.18]Oh, I can't.
[171:14.29]I can't just get up there.
[171:19.99]Teleporter will... Oh, yeah.
[171:20.81]I just can't do it.
[171:21.45]Alright.
[171:21.85]Well, I'll go... Let's go to the teleporter.
[171:23.25]One of the teleporters that was here.
[171:25.51]There was one right here.
[171:28.70]The elevator?
[171:29.20]I don't want to use them right now.
[171:31.34]I only have a certain amount.
[171:34.66]I don't want to use them.
[171:38.74]Okay.
[171:39.48]Let's go on the teleporter.
[171:42.60]Where was it?
[171:43.20]It was like right here, right?
[171:46.64]Where was it?
[171:47.08]It was like right here?
[171:48.93]This edge.
[171:53.97]You really should restart the game.
[171:59.23]I wonder... You know what's going to be really interesting eventually?
[172:06.43]What all the speedrunners do.
[172:11.11]Imagine this game speed ran.
[172:13.69]How?
[172:14.37]Where do you go?
[172:19.38]Really?
[172:19.70]This is where you took me?
[172:30.61]Is it just to go between those two?
[172:40.25]What's the point of that?
[172:41.03]There's no point in doing that.
[172:47.50]Is a speedrun... Is a boss there?
[172:51.10]Okay, let me check that out right there.
[172:59.57]Can I get to that from here?
[173:00.85]And if not, then I'm just going to go back and we'll continue to trek through.
[173:05.07]Don't you just love...
[173:07.92]I've been playing for almost three hours, and this whole three hours has been me stumbling upon a random-ass place, and fighting a boss that was at the end of it, and it was really fun and cool, and the area's crazy.
[173:23.25]I haven't done... This was just, oh, what's this?
[173:25.49]Gazebo!
[173:26.15]And then I walked in it, and here we are, three hours later.
[173:30.33]Hell yeah.
[173:33.59]That's remarkable.
[173:37.89]I can still explore up here.
[173:39.94]Can I get even further up?
[173:56.72]Is there a reason to go on that?
[173:57.86]Probably not.
[174:05.37]I love getting flasks, but I would really like a seed to make it so I don't have a plus one flask.
[174:14.97]Alright, hold on.
[174:15.73]Settle down.
[174:21.24]Settle down.
[174:23.28]Going this way.
[174:24.96]Cave over here.
[174:28.30]Do you want a hint for that or do you want to find it on your own?
[174:30.92]Um, I would say if it begins to start to become like a real problem where I actually don't come across them at all.
[174:37.03]Over the next like couple hours maybe because I cannot have one flask.
[174:40.91]That's going to be horrible.
[174:42.63]Plus one I mean.
[174:49.35]Rune Arc.
[174:53.71]Cool.
[174:55.09]Still haven't used any of those.
[175:02.75]I believe we have exhausted everything we can do in this area.
[175:06.35]For now.
[175:08.09]For now.
[175:15.22]For now.
[175:20.04]How do I get out of here?
[175:23.40]Okay.
[175:27.95]Through the elevator?
[175:33.65]Don't leave.
[175:35.01]Don't leave.
[175:35.65]This is the third one.
[175:37.49]Find it.
[175:39.44]Um... Can you note down the two teleporters?
[175:46.50]Yeah, I went in both of them.
[175:48.64]They just travel between each other.
[175:50.08]They just go one to the other.
[175:52.42]I'm probably just going to delete that now in my notes.
[176:05.15]I've done what I've been able to see that I can really do.
[176:09.69]The only exception is going back here and just taking one quick look around, like here.
[176:22.04]Oh, not here.
[176:22.48]The next one.
[176:22.88]This one here.
[176:36.27]Because there's... Back here... Wait, no.
[176:41.32]Where... No, that was correct.
[176:44.02]That was correct.
[176:46.38]Yeah, that was correct.
[176:46.88]Yeah, that was correct.
[176:54.79]Is this going to kill me?
[176:55.41]Oh, okay.
[176:59.83]So, back here... There's this thing, right?
[177:04.74]Because this is the kind of in-between area where I came from.
[177:07.00]Now, can I go?
[177:08.12]I'm gonna check really quick.
[177:11.20]Because that's that elevator.
[177:17.76]Elevator there.
[177:25.76]What does your stream title mean?
[177:27.19]Um...
[177:31.47]I don't know, man.
[177:33.74]No, okay.
[177:34.00]Go back up.
[177:36.98]Item scaling.
[177:37.76]Like, I have an A scaling with Macho Powder.
[177:40.78]Because it's doing so much for me.
[177:42.33]And it's making my game... It's making me, like, so much better.
[177:44.71]Making my gameplay so much better.
[177:51.37]Oh, I'm going back down.
[177:52.19]Fucking whatever.
[177:53.94]Just get off.
[177:54.30]Get off.
[177:54.48]Get off.
[177:54.76]I don't want to... Okay, I'm an idiot.
[178:00.42]Yeah, this just takes you back to where I was the first time.
[178:02.95]Yeah, I'm out.
[178:04.87]It was cool.
[178:05.91]If I need to come back, I will.
[178:11.55]So we're going to get out.
[178:12.95]And I'm going to go back to where I was here.
[178:16.12]Because I wanted to go this way.
[178:24.50]And that's when I got... This is that area there.
[178:27.35]Okay.
[178:28.73]I want to check what this is.
[178:31.22]Let's go here.
[178:39.31]End of the stream?
[178:40.11]What?
[178:41.45]The stream is not turning off for at least... At the very least... Like five or six hours.
[178:50.21]So... You've got that wrong.
[178:59.04]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[179:00.62]Dave...
[179:04.08]And I'm going to tell you, I am going to take a break.
[179:08.04]Somewhere later tonight.
[179:09.18]Like probably in a few hours.
[179:10.52]A couple hours maybe.
[179:11.24]I'm going to eat.
[179:13.70]So I'm going to eat something.
[179:16.58]Whatever that is.
[179:17.08]Figure that out.
[179:18.13]Maybe.
[179:18.37]I'm going to eat.
[179:23.15]And... After that, where am I going?
[179:28.01]This way.
[179:29.79]So I will be able to eat something.
[179:33.04]It won't be a 30 minute break now.
[179:50.18]This way.
[179:52.94]That will give me the energy to be able to stream for like probably another few hours.
[179:56.50]So I'll be good to go.
[179:58.10]God damn it.
[179:58.62]I keep going.
[179:59.12]Wait, there's one of those things.
[180:06.61]Uh, what?
[180:09.01]What?
[180:09.63]That's not... That's literally not that far.
[180:12.79]What are you talking about?
[180:13.59]That was not far at all.
[180:19.27]I've survived other falls that were more than that.
[180:23.50]I'm terrified to do that now.
[180:27.36]What?
[180:34.94]Um, I'm terrified to do this.
[180:37.26]That kills me?
[180:38.28]Look at how short that is.
[180:44.22]It's a bug.
[180:45.18]Ah, no.
[180:45.80]No, it's not.
[180:46.68]I'm sorry.
[180:47.28]I'm going down here.
[180:53.64]I'm terrified to do this.
[181:04.01]I swear to God, don't fall.
[181:05.35]Hold on, wait.
[181:06.38]What if I... Pick up the souls.
[181:11.46]Oh, they're not... Okay, we're good.
[181:12.62]Alright, how did I get over there last time?
[181:21.61]Like, I'm just trying to go this way.
[181:33.58]You're gonna cross the river.
[181:38.18]That just teleported you.
[181:39.50]Oh, that's... Okay, right.
[181:41.00]Does this kill me?
[181:41.62]It does?
[181:50.23]I swear I jumped down here before.
[181:53.57]I swear to God.
[182:01.90]How did I get in there before?
[182:03.00]I was down there before.
[182:05.40]Remember?
[182:05.66]I was like, oh, if you're looking for that blood weapon, it's down here.
[182:11.69]Well, okay.
[182:12.11]We're going to find another way across the bridge.
[182:21.43]Jump later.
[182:21.99]I don't think the double jump stops fatal fall damage.
[182:41.29]A weird guy in a Burger King costume comes over and wrecks your campsite and kills you.
[182:50.16]Might get his weapon.
[183:08.13]Cadence sellswords.
[183:13.32]Cool.
[183:14.12]And what was that?
[183:14.74]Strength and dex... It's a greatsword?
[183:20.44]Nice.
[183:34.53]That's pretty cool.
[183:35.09]What's that?
[183:35.49]What's the weapon art?
[183:38.65]Like a cool spin?
[183:39.97]Cool.
[183:48.49]Very nice.
[183:48.95]Look at how powerful I am.
[184:00.20]Being back in Limgrave.
[184:02.59]You have nothing on me.
[184:08.13]Is that another armored car?
[184:13.03]Unless that's the armored car that came all the way down... What road?
[184:19.28]No, that's another armored car.
[184:22.00]Let's go.
[184:26.40]Where's the tree, Sentinel?
[184:27.90]Ah, I beat him a long time ago.
[184:29.14]That was the first boss I killed.
[184:36.38]Did I already get this?
[184:37.46]Or is this another just armored car?
[184:41.64]Let's go.
[184:48.43]How do I get them to stop?
[184:52.59]Stop!
[184:59.20]Stop the vehicle!
[185:02.50]Stop the vehicle!
[185:12.93]Stop the vehicle!
[185:25.02]Oh shit.
[185:25.36]Here they come.
[185:31.48]Great axe.
[185:32.71]Bye.
[185:35.19]Look at this.
[185:35.65]Oh my god.
[185:36.45]How many people?
[185:51.00]How about you?
[186:07.97]I'm so much stronger than them now.
[186:23.22]Shut up!
[186:24.48]You fucking idiot!
[186:28.06]What was that guy doing?
[186:56.55]I can't?
[186:58.57]Why can't I?
[186:59.38]I don't have any mana.
[187:16.55]Alright.
[187:17.83]Cool.
[187:18.59]I got a great axe.
[187:21.33]I'm so powerful for this area now though.
[187:28.56]Alright, I want to go right here.
[187:32.10]Because, like, what is this?
[187:33.68]It's kind of cool.
[187:34.43]What's over here?
[187:41.91]Waypoint Ruins.
[187:44.11]Remember, there are two items.
[187:53.56]Ooh.
[187:59.13]Left stick makes it so you dismount easier.
[188:01.35]I unbound my dismount.
[188:02.93]Because it's crouch tune and it ruins my video game experience.
[188:09.34]Alright, there's probably like a mini boss down here.
[188:10.82]Let's get it.
[188:20.42]Flowstone.
[188:21.54]Flowstone.
[188:28.54]There's one in the front.
[188:29.37]There's an item in the front of the cart?!
[188:34.11]You're not gonna tell me twice?! !
[188:58.94]I
[189:30.11]Thanks for making me come all the way back here.
[189:33.63]For nothing.
[189:35.91]Okay, I need a bonfire.
[189:36.75]I mean, I have enough to level up, so I have to be careful.
[189:46.60]People calling me Jimmy?
[189:48.08]Why are you calling... You guys are full of weird baits today.
[189:57.55]Okay.
[189:57.91]Okay.
[190:01.69]Why Jimmy?
[190:06.39]Okay.
[190:10.77]Up there?
[190:11.11]Is it Fortnite?
[190:15.39]Fortnite Jimmy?
[190:16.37]Alright, I got a good view.
[190:28.75]Found it.
[190:47.34]Damn, man, I got poisoned.
[190:48.52]I was just trying to pick up the items and leave.
[190:50.26]There's definitely a bonfire down here.
[190:56.43]Oh, it's just a boss.
[190:59.67]Shit, I need a bonfire over here somewhere.
[191:05.53]Oh, hey there, Jimmy.
[191:06.73]Oh, hey there, Jimmy.
[191:08.71]Oh, hey there.
[191:11.43]Oh, hey, Jimmy.
[191:18.00]There's got to be a teleporter here.
[191:19.76]Well, whatever.
[191:23.52]I'll just mark it.
[191:24.90]Come back.
[191:26.04]I'll level up anyways because I might die to boss.
[191:35.55]Oh, I'm turning around.
[191:36.77]There's going to be one right here somewhere.
[191:40.99]Down the road.
[191:41.53]Just wait.
[191:42.55]There has to be one.
[191:45.55]Sitting on the side like usually, right?
[191:47.45]Come on.
[192:08.75]A little lake.
[192:09.67]Right at the edge.
[192:13.55]Why am I dying?
[192:14.11]Because I am currently poisoned.
[192:18.05]It has to be.
[192:24.26]It's definitely not.
[192:24.96]It's just so far away.
[192:25.94]Can we get a look at me please?
[192:31.94]Look at me.
[192:43.83]Alright, I have 20.
[192:44.53]Which is where I want it to be.
[192:47.21]Pretty balanced.
[192:49.05]I do need more Endurance.
[192:50.41]And we need 2 more Mind.
[192:51.87]And I need to get to 20.
[192:52.97]18 Endurance, 20 Mind.
[192:56.61]And then the rest is going into Intelligence and Dexterity.
[192:58.57]For the rest of the game.
[193:06.05]I'll keep it at 8 heals.
[193:07.37]That's fine.
[193:08.03]I've got these Sacred Tears.
[193:13.68]I have no fucking idea.
[193:14.54]Did I get 20 likes on this?
[193:20.54]20 likes.
[193:23.36]What are you smoking crack?
[193:26.64]Okay, back here.
[193:28.13]I'm gonna go in those ruins and fight the boss.
[193:51.14]Something definitely over here as well.
[193:52.48]Yeah, hold on.
[193:53.44]There's a lot of just random shit.
[193:55.80]Look at all these runes.
[193:57.58]Golden rune, golden rune.
[193:58.70]Try to get them all.
[194:04.77]Cool.
[194:05.85]Very cool.
[194:08.53]Something going on up there?
[194:09.45]What's your deal?
[194:26.52]What's your deal?
[194:37.00]Wow, look at that tower.
[194:37.88]Alright, let's go down here and do whatever is happening in this area.
[194:58.51]Let's see what's in here.
[194:59.91]I'm robust.
[195:00.39]Let's go.
[195:06.43]Mad pumpkin head.
[195:11.44]Oh, man.
[195:12.10]I am very leveled for you.
[195:30.08]Got him.
[195:37.30]Got him!
[195:39.52]Thousand souls!
[195:40.64]Holy shit, imagine if I was like level two.
[195:54.52]Wait.
[195:57.08]Oh, you're gonna sneak this back here, huh?
[195:59.48]Hello.
[196:01.86]Okay.
[196:04.14]Um, a new NPC.
[196:09.18]Oh my god, we've... My queen!
[196:14.89]I finally found you.
[196:15.77]How long has it been?
[196:20.37]Three, four, five years.
[196:22.11]My queen.
[196:26.17]Tarnished, are we?
[196:28.35]No wonder you should turn up here.
[196:30.67]I am Salen, a sorcerer.
[196:32.27]Sorcerer.
[196:33.11]Why are you here?
[196:38.74]A yen for glint stone sorceress.
[196:40.56]A burger queen.
[196:41.76]Well, your aptitude does appear...
[196:46.00]Witch!
[196:46.20]Ugh.
[196:46.38]Witch.
[197:09.01]Well, you are a piece of work.
[197:10.89]I could be a warlock.
[197:12.63]You are now my protege in Glintstone Sorcery.
[197:15.57]But I refuse to coddle or cast kind words.
[197:19.51]Never.
[197:20.59]Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.
[197:23.70]Did you see what level I am?
[197:32.40]A lot.
[197:33.18]Enhances left-hand shield damage negation?
[197:35.68]I already have this.
[197:39.16]Glintstone's stars.
[197:40.66]I have Glintstone arc.
[197:44.51]Glintstone barrage.
[197:46.99]Or Glintstone's armament.
[197:54.23]okay I want a compilation for the amount of times that I've gone like over here just like one two three four five six seven eight nine I feel it's been like 30 times can't can I actually put this on my weapon because this is this is a huge deal if I can I'm gonna I think so
[198:22.26]Yes, we shall, in just a minute.
[199:01.14]Kill her.
[199:03.46]Why would I kill her when she's the only person that has these moves?
[199:11.41]Alright, the other one that I want... Crystal Barrage or... Stars.
[199:23.62]Barrage sounds kind of cool.
[199:29.66]Fires a volley of glintstone and crystal shards.
[199:32.20]Charging increases potency.
[199:35.50]Fires three magic shooting stars that pursue the target.
[199:37.52]This source can be cast while in motion.
[199:39.90]And you can charge it.
[199:45.30]Didn't the turtle sell this?
[199:48.78]I think the turtle already sells this.
[199:56.17]I don't think the turtle has this one.
[200:00.08]He sold comets.
[200:06.36]Stars is garbage.
[200:08.51]I wonder how Barrage... I wonder what that is.
[200:12.03]I'll try Barrage.
[200:12.65]I already have the other ones besides the shield.
[200:17.79]Go play with our new toys.
[200:20.13]R1, R1, R1, R1.
[200:21.47]Goodbye.
[200:22.97]Thank you.
[200:26.51]That was cool.
[200:28.14]That was definitely worth stumbling upon.
[200:32.20]Red glintstone, please.
[200:33.12]Okay, so here is magic weapon.
[200:42.45]So I have glintstone pebble, swift glintstone shard, great glintstone shard, comet, which I can't use, garage.
[200:54.69]Alright, so I have to leave this area.
[200:59.28]Okay, cool.
[201:02.58]Stars is good.
[201:07.32]Sorcery in the other FromSoftware games is kind of weird.
[201:11.94]It's a little odd.
[201:16.07]Some of the moves were just dog shit.
[201:18.45]Just absolute dog shit.
[201:20.17]And they scaled terribly.
[201:21.13]And it was like, why are they even in the game?
[201:23.87]I don't know.
[201:24.23]I hope they actually... Are all these viable?
[201:32.88]That's kind of cool.
[201:37.96]Oh my god!
[201:38.98]What the fuck?
[201:40.90]This guy's dead.
[201:44.80]Sucks.
[201:46.45]Alright, let's keep going this way.
[201:58.69]That's my destination.
[202:03.06]But yeah, sorcery was always one of those weird things they put in all these games.
[202:08.42]Because there's, like, one move that scales and is just unbelievable and has the right cast time to be the best.
[202:15.11]But then they have, like, a dozen other of these, like, crystal barrage pebble stones that they just, like, suck and they're just useless.
[202:24.67]PVE.
[202:26.49]Right?
[202:26.65]Because a lot of sorcery is insane in PvP.
[202:28.77]Going the wrong way?
[202:33.77]Still alive.
[202:47.20]I'm going the wrong way.
[202:47.80]You're right.
[202:55.69]Ooh.
[202:56.31]Caden armor.
[203:00.47]But yeah.
[203:01.13]Sorcery...
[203:02.19]Some of those things are cool in PvP, and that's what they're kind of maybe designed for.
[203:05.19]It does look like there's a lot more interesting spells.
[203:10.91]At least, from what it looks like.
[203:14.33]At least, maybe initially.
[203:16.25]I could be wrong.
[203:18.39]Uh, so we gotta go this way, towards one.
[203:27.36]Hello?
[203:31.81]Oh, sapling, sweet sapling of glorious gold, has your crystal teardrop ripened?
[203:43.78]You look like an NPC from the PS2 Sopranos game.
[203:46.60]The only reason why I'm addressing that comment is because I think I've seen that comment like 30 times in the last four straight days.
[203:53.48]I keep seeing that comment.
[203:58.45]What do you want me to say?
[203:59.95]You want me to be like, yo, what the fuck?
[204:02.75]What did you say?
[204:03.91]What do you want me to say?
[204:05.07]Maybe I'll run into something else here.
[204:30.70]Don't!
[204:36.89]The Elden Ring.
[204:38.49]Yeah, the Elden Ring.
[204:41.32]The Elden Lord.
[204:48.22]Lord.
[204:48.94]Oh, nice.
[205:08.02]I'm actually happy to find it.
[205:12.98]In the meantime, I'm going to do this because I'm running out of mana.
[205:18.73]Let's try this.
[205:20.31]This is Crystal Barrage.
[205:22.27]It's kind of annoying.
[205:23.27]Can't do it.
[205:33.90]Can't do it on this weapon.
[205:45.44]Oh, well.
[205:46.94]Do I have to be in combat?
[205:48.06]I don't think I do.
[205:49.18]I think this is already a magic weapon, so they won't let me do it.
[205:52.92]Yep.
[205:56.02]Nope.
[205:56.48]It's like, sorry.
[205:57.86]Ready?
[205:58.18]Let's see.
[205:58.84]Watch this.
[206:03.61]Sad.
[206:05.11]Sad.
[206:05.73]Because look at how it's so blue and pretty.
[206:08.35]Sad.
[206:09.89]That's very sad.
[206:10.93]Sad.
[206:17.64]Very, very sad.
[206:19.42]So, I got to put the other stuff back on.
[206:26.83]Greatsword is... I'm going to keep the Greatsword on.
[206:28.55]It's been very useful.
[206:30.59]This has to come off in favor of Great Glintstone.
[206:33.30]Because I want to give that a try.
[206:35.66]I haven't really played with it.
[206:39.68]That's really sad.
[206:42.86]But this thing is really good.
[206:44.13]It's already infused.
[206:48.14]Wait, what?
[206:52.64]What happened to my... What happened to my clothes?
[206:53.80]What happened?
[207:05.49]Marian Knight is still good.
[207:07.03]Does the armor do anything for me?
[207:08.39]No.
[207:12.94]Aiden armor is pretty good, too.
[207:21.66]Do any of these do anything for me?
[207:23.45]Probably not.
[207:33.43]Redmane gauntlets are better.
[207:34.66]They're a lot heavier though.
[207:39.14]They're just better.
[207:50.37]Get these stupid horns off.
[207:55.21]I'm gonna have to wear this the whole game, I think.
[207:56.99]Yeah, I'm gonna have to try that new shard.
[208:05.00]Let's go.
[208:06.36]On the horse.
[208:08.37]Going to this place over here.
[208:10.99]Through the woods.
[208:17.66]Dude, look at the graphics on that rock.
[208:20.00]They were pretty good.
[208:20.74]Alright, new area.
[208:22.60]Alright, this is like a little bear.
[208:25.97]Not as scary as the other one, but what's this?
[208:41.09]You are quite susceptible.
[208:42.71]You're not as scary as your big brother.
[208:48.70]You're not as scary as mama bear.
[208:56.44]Hmm.
[209:06.53]Alright, there's a huge one.
[209:10.17]Ah!
[209:14.47]Crown slam?
[209:25.66]This is so awesome because you could literally just come back here.
[209:29.72]You could just go this way instead of the way that I went.
[209:33.68]when you play for the first time with a new character.
[209:36.24]It doesn't matter.
[209:38.56]That's awesome for colossal weapons.
[209:40.06]Yeah.
[209:40.60]Coming over there.
[209:51.16]Open for business.
[209:55.96]Ooh.
[209:58.50]Somebody's open for business.
[210:12.44]Let's check out this.
[210:13.26]See how the glint's done.
[210:16.26]It's really slow, but if it hits... Okay.
[210:25.18]It's not that big of a deal.
[210:26.30]That move is really not good at all, actually.
[210:39.17]It's not good at all.
[210:42.91]It's actually pretty bad.
[210:43.55]Alright, what is that?
[210:48.97]Because I'm about to go explore it.
[210:52.29]Demihumans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken.
[210:55.96]Where are you, Lord Kenneth?
[210:57.48]The night bedeviled by blood.
[211:01.90]He's in there.
[211:04.32]Let's go pay him a visit.
[211:18.65]Bring the Burger Queen some squirrels to get the good stuff.
[211:23.10]I brought the squirrels to the turtle.
[211:24.48]Maybe that was a mistake.
[211:31.88]Yeah, this thing kind of sucks.
[211:38.50]Now, the sword takes the arc.
[211:40.94]Takes place with the arc.
[211:42.16]Um... Pol is okay.
[211:44.21]Maybe we should just put Starlight on, just for fun.
[211:49.87]I mean, it's really pretty.
[212:02.79]I'll keep it.
[212:03.21]Whatever.
[212:04.71]I really only use these two anyways for now, so I'll keep them on.
[212:06.99]The swift glintstone is awesome because it just happens in one second.
[212:15.07]It's good at night, too.
[212:15.79]It lights up the area.
[212:20.26]What about the new summon?
[212:21.18]Oh, that's true.
[212:23.46]Put it on after this.
[212:29.78]Yeah, this is crazy because this is definitely a lower...
[212:33.78]Please tell me that's one of those tiers.
[212:35.38]Oh, that's a golden seed.
[212:36.85]Alright, let's go be high level Andy and just fucking wipe this whole place apart.
[212:49.84]Is he fighting?
[212:50.44]Why is he fighting though?
[213:01.31]Over leveled Andy.
[213:03.51]Well, I'm... I mean, I'm coming here for a very specific purpose.
[213:07.35]I just wanted to see what was over here.
[213:10.81]I also really needed that.
[213:12.19]Hey, where's your leader?
[213:18.42]The only one that can give me a true challenge.
[213:22.90]Who runs this place?
[213:23.90]Oh, okay.
[213:34.97]Or hate.
[213:36.77]I feel like this thing's going to get up.
[213:44.39]Blood Rose.
[213:45.79]Fortnite.
[214:02.88]So this is where... Watch out for that explosion!
[214:05.22]That would actually kill me.
[214:07.10]If all the things were... Oh my fucking god.
[214:09.86]Where was I?
[214:14.70]Alright, just stop.
[214:17.18]Yeah, you can tell how overleveled I am for... I'm just seeing if they have any items in this port.
[214:23.61]I'm just looking for, like, sacred tear shard things.
[214:26.63]I promise I'm not, like, trying to be, like, an idiot.
[214:29.07]And just be like, look, I'm just gonna do the easy stuff.
[214:45.36]See?
[214:45.64]I don't even care about that.
[214:47.06]Go up.
[215:01.79]You have to go to sacred places.
[215:05.01]Oh.
[215:06.01]Isn't that- is this a sacred place?
[215:10.13]You know when Swift Glintstone shard is killing things in one hit that you're gonna embarrass this guy in front of... What?
[215:16.62]How many people here?
[215:17.12]50,000?
[215:17.14]What an asshole.
[215:48.45]That's actually not a joke.
[215:54.54]Imagine fighting this guy at like level 3.
[215:59.00]Uh oh.
[216:23.89]Bloody Slash!
[216:26.27]And Godrick Knight Gauntlets.
[216:29.33]I almost said glasses.
[216:32.79]You could probably get a sword.
[216:33.93]That sword's probably awesome.
[216:35.20]You see how cool that looks?
[216:42.10]Godrick Knight's glasses.
[216:44.02]I'm just wearing them.
[216:45.72]Just have a pair of glasses on.
[216:47.10]That would be so funny.
[216:47.94]Oh my god.
[216:48.72]LOLing so hard.
[216:58.14]There are two more Burger King masks?
[217:01.02]Well, maybe I'll find them eventually.
[217:06.46]I'm looking for a very... Okay.
[217:08.08]So here we go.
[217:08.60]This is like the end of the little dungeon.
[217:16.94]left.
[217:17.12]They're going to pull some Resident Evil shit here.
[217:27.47]Join medallions to operate Grand Lift of Dectus.
[217:32.48]The right half is said to reside in Fort Faroth in the Dragon Barrow far to the east.
[217:43.43]Like over here?
[217:54.48]Dragon Barrow far to the east is... Okay.
[218:30.35]Okay.
[218:36.17]Looks good.
[218:41.00]Well, I'm actually kind of glad I got that.
[218:44.28]Cool.
[218:47.36]So now I wonder... Is it time to start to progress through here?
[218:55.77]I mean, it's pointing me here, right?
[218:57.93]Like, this is... I think I can handle this.
[218:59.61]Impassable Great Bridge.
[219:00.59]It wants me to go this way.
[219:03.87]Or it wants me to go up here.
[219:11.00]Like, in this area.
[219:15.64]Or it wants me to go... That dragon... You know what?
[219:20.93]Let's go kill that dragon.
[219:22.65]Yeah, let's go get that motherfucker right now.
[219:36.41]You should break a SEGA Dreamcast over your head.
[219:42.17]Okay, great idea.
[219:47.44]Is there a ton of content in the Academy that you missed?
[219:50.74]Yeah, but I mean... I'm just kind of browsing around.
[220:01.58]I got 8 flasks.
[220:02.66]I have more health now.
[220:04.02]And I'm going to put on the magic defense shit.
[220:08.70]I think I have most of it on already.
[220:10.46]Magic defense.
[220:13.80]Carrying gloves.
[220:18.37]Cloth trousers, weirdly enough.
[220:20.35]Okay.
[220:20.67]This has got good magic defense.
[220:25.43]Alright, what about this thing?
[220:26.05]Magic.
[220:27.23]Magic.
[220:31.45]Brass shield, but I can't wear this one here.
[220:32.97]Okay.
[220:35.83]I'm ready to fight the dragon.
[220:42.58]Marked at number one.
[220:43.66]Let's go.
[220:49.22]Would you find a medallion, please?
[220:50.46]I need it.
[220:53.30]Um, that medallion, that east, uh, that left part of the medallion is in Fort Haight, which is down here all the way on, like, this little tail end here.
[221:03.21]Actually, literally right next to, uh, right barely to the east of the lake.
[221:12.10]Fort Haight.
[221:48.81]Sorry, I didn't do this.
[221:52.16]Game fucking A's me.
[221:54.58]Alright, let's do it.
[221:55.80]It's time.
[221:56.22]I actually need to go upgrade this weapon too.
[221:57.96]I think I got a somber stone.
[222:00.40]Let's see.
[222:05.87]This is a fight of just patience and just attacking only when you need to.
[222:12.54]Hope I don't get one shot by something, but you know I'm prepared.
[222:15.06]Got the boys if I need to call on them, which I don't think I will.
[222:19.46]Let's go get this guy.
[222:27.63]I can probably get a few hits on him while he's lying down, which is exactly what I'm going to try to do.
[222:52.69]I like just I like missed like 40% of those hits
[223:28.56]Don't land on me!
[223:29.28]We're doing, it's three hits.
[223:35.32]One, two, three, and that's it.
[223:41.11]Getting close.
[223:42.61]One, two, one, it's fine.
[223:56.05]Aye!
[223:58.75]Get the fuck out of the way!
[224:02.80]I just hit my head on the ceiling!
[224:19.55]Cookie bug ambush.
[224:20.81]Yeah, what was that?
[224:26.11]I don't know why my brain was just like, wait, that's an item bug.
[224:29.11]But it's not.
[224:29.99]Those guys just hang out there.
[224:34.03]There's probably a closer bonfire here somewhere too, right?
[224:41.26]I thought this was a 1440p gamer.
[224:43.34]I am.
[224:44.90]I just don't stream in 1440p.
[224:45.74]I stream in 864p.
[224:46.12]Not 1080p.
[224:46.64]Stop asking me.
[225:05.03]Alright, well that was dumb.
[225:06.83]But you know, we're gonna go for it again.
[225:08.55]If I can use my shield as a weapon.
[225:16.03]Okay, this time don't miss every single time.
[225:27.80]Just stand right next to his leg and do it.
[225:41.84]I didn't jump over?
[225:42.55]I don't think I did.
[226:11.52]We gotta... I was gonna say, we gotta get away from this gigantic stone slab that's in the fucking way.
[226:37.28]I gotta just run away.
[226:38.89]Just after I aggro the guy.
[226:40.79]Just run the fuck away.
[226:41.75]Just get him away from all the debris and fucking rock formation shit that's scattered around.
[226:48.13]Just bring him out.
[226:52.92]So we don't end up going like this.
[227:02.82]Find a closer bonfire.
[227:04.00]Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[227:15.42]He's really strong against magic.
[227:16.63]Yeah, he's an anti-me.
[227:20.01]What the... I should be killing him so much more swiftly.
[227:25.21]Okay.
[227:25.93]I'm not... Let me just see.
[227:26.91]Is there a little fire over here or something?
[227:28.63]Let's not go for him yet.
[227:33.56]Maybe there's like a fire.
[227:34.72]What's this?
[227:35.00]Okay.
[227:46.97]What's this?
[228:09.81]Academy Crystal Cave.
[228:16.66]Academy.
[228:17.97]Crystal cave is what it just said.
[228:21.93]And look at how much closer this is.
[228:29.19]Okay, summoning stone thing.
[228:50.42]I'm glad I have the Starlight.
[228:54.21]Seems to be pretty helpful here.
[228:55.29]Cave Moss?
[229:02.63]Crystal Cave Moss?
[229:05.92]Oh, I don't like that.
[229:06.68]Give it back.
[229:20.51]Whoa, what the fuck?
[229:23.05]Wow, I'm not sneaky.
[229:24.23]I'm a gigantic beacon of light.
[229:26.91]There's so many people here.
[229:33.70]I'm a blip on their mini-map right now.
[229:35.72]This is... Oh god, okay.
[229:46.95]Shit, they all aggroed.
[229:47.75]Nope, not all of them.
[230:20.63]I look like one of you.
[230:22.93]But I'm not.
[230:25.24]In the darkness, we all look alike, don't we, with our masks?
[230:31.64]They couldn't tell the difference.
[230:37.72]The imposter.
[230:43.51]Okay, so there's something over here.
[230:49.93]Look who glimpsed on.
[230:59.14]What else we got?
[230:59.74]There's definitely more.
[231:10.94]Very interested in what's at the end of this.
[231:18.73]Jesus, that almost hit me in the head.
[231:34.03]Fireflies.
[231:34.69]Dude, I came in here with the required item.
[231:43.08]Imagine coming down here without sorcery and without starlight.
[231:48.12]That'd be a living hell.
[232:00.10]You just get a lantern or a torch.
[232:04.18]Don't diminish my cool character.
[232:05.88]That replaces one of them, right?
[232:13.56]Okay, so that's that.
[232:27.05]There's that way.
[232:28.23]Can I do anything up here?
[232:37.49]Oh, skeletons.
[232:38.41]The game is really, really loading something heavily, so I...
[233:19.29]Wanna do a magician fight?
[233:20.20]That's fine.
[233:22.98]Oh, maybe I'll get that one.
[233:24.46]I might get that move.
[233:33.41]Motherfucker.
[233:35.67]Oh my god, you double motherfuckers.
[233:37.23]I'm out of here.
[233:53.72]What, did he run out of mana?
[233:56.74]What did he do?
[234:00.74]Oh my god, he's got a magic hammer!
[234:32.63]Please give me the magic hammer.
[234:41.84]He's got this huge hammer.
[234:43.26]That's so cool.
[234:44.00]Alright.
[234:44.71]Let's check and see what he was guarding.
[234:49.69]Wait.
[234:50.59]There's a boss in there, too.
[234:52.15]Oh, man.
[234:52.65]It's gonna be rough.
[235:03.58]Excuse me?
[235:04.32]Where are you?
[235:05.36]Oh.
[235:12.05]He's pre-farming.
[235:16.34]There's two chests here.
[235:44.09]Boost crystal sorcery, which I don't... Is the sword technically crystal?
[235:49.16]I think the sword is a crystal sorcery.
[236:00.57]Or is it Glintstone?
[236:05.78]48 intelligence to put it on.
[236:12.70]I only have Glintstones right now.
[236:15.18]Crystal Palat Virage.
[236:16.16]But the Greatsword thing that I swing.
[236:21.11]Eat cereal or soup tonight?
[236:22.33]I'll probably tell you soup.
[236:23.23]Because soup sounds a little more healthy.
[236:25.93]And more nutrient-based than Captain Crunch.
[236:29.76]So I would say that you'd probably have soup tonight.
[236:35.72]Okay, there's another chest in here too.
[236:41.51]And a rune arc.
[236:42.17]Cool.
[236:46.95]Well.
[236:49.23]Unless there's a bonfire here.
[236:50.83]I'm going to have to just go in here and see if I can do it.
[236:57.87]I've got 5,000 souls though.
[236:59.49]Maybe I should just run through it.
[237:05.12]What do you think?
[237:07.24]Bye to 5,000 souls.
[237:08.46]Yeah.
[237:09.06]No.
[237:09.16]It's not worth it.
[237:10.42]Unless do I have...
[237:13.46]I don't know.
[237:17.02]It's only 5k.
[237:18.58]I can always go get it again.
[237:19.46]Alright, let's go.
[237:20.92]I'm gonna go for it.
[237:22.33]5k is not that much right now.
[237:25.85]It's two people.
[237:28.37]Oh, it's these two.
[237:29.31]I remember these guys.
[237:30.19]13 fucking damage.
[237:38.45]That's it?
[237:39.64]Oh, I'm doing this wrong.
[237:42.99]I need to hit them with something else.
[237:52.71]I wonder how I'm supposed to hurt them.
[238:07.63]Oh my god, this guy is so annoying.
[238:11.26]Fucking R1 spamming piece of shit.
[238:28.32]Do I like end up breaking their crystals stuff?
[238:34.22]I don't know what the fuck he's doing.
[238:36.59]God, his fucking friend is so annoying.
[238:42.03]No, this is wrong, dude.
[238:43.19]I gotta, like... I gotta attack him with something else.
[238:48.55]I would call the boys in.
[238:49.61]I don't have... I can't.
[238:53.07]Do I have any... What else can I hit him with?
[238:54.93]They made it to crystals.
[238:55.89]Maybe I should use, like, fire or something?
[239:00.82]Yeah, I remember these guys.
[239:09.58]Alright, we're gonna... I got it.
[239:10.70]I got it.
[239:10.94]We're gonna get those souls back.
[239:22.65]I think you just have to... You probably have to hit them enough times to shatter them, right?
[239:28.27]That makes sense.
[239:29.49]Oh man, this is far.
[239:30.41]Okay, well... I'm just gonna run.
[239:33.23]I got the boys on standby.
[239:34.54]You fucking idiot.
[239:46.82]Strike damage?
[239:53.96]I have... Slash pierce, standard pierce.
[239:59.83]Pierce, pierce, slash, strike.
[240:03.81]I mean, the flail is a piece of crap, but it's strike.
[240:07.87]Maybe that'll break it.
[240:08.85]I mean, this thing sucks, but whatever.
[240:10.13]I'm not looking to do anything fancy.
[240:13.08]Will it break their armor?
[240:15.94]Maybe it will.
[240:16.58]I'll try it.
[240:20.80]I don't think I have a blunt weapon that...
[240:26.45]I don't have a blunt weapon.
[240:28.25]I got rid of all of them.
[240:33.82]I have a strategy.
[240:34.46]Strategy is... Just kite the guy.
[240:36.68]The guy that's like... Just R1 spamming.
[240:46.47]And... I don't know who the fuck I am right now.
[240:49.55]So we're gonna have to figure that out.
[240:51.45]Real quick.
[240:53.59]Okay, so let's go this way.
[240:57.48]Fuck, I'm kidding.
[241:05.35]Is that big black guy?
[241:07.13]There's huge guys here.
[241:08.69]Run around.
[241:09.07]Alright, let's go boys.
[241:33.49]Alright, drag him across the whole thing.
[241:36.19]Because he's really slow.
[241:41.81]Okay, now... I'm stuck on a fucking rock!
[241:44.23]I was stuck in the rock!
[241:49.21]Dumbass fucking game.
[241:57.22]There we go, alright.
[242:04.35]Nice job, boys.
[242:15.01]Are they dead?
[242:26.12]Same strategy, pull them all the way back.
[242:27.98]Oh, what's that?
[242:28.70]What's that?
[242:29.32]Oh, a thing.
[242:30.81]I can't even get rid of it.
[242:31.45]I don't know what time to dodge this though.
[242:47.48]Oh, you're both so fucking annoying.
[242:49.45]Come on, hurry up.
[242:50.19]I might- I'll just kill this guy first.
[242:53.35]Just line aside him by the- with a statue.
[243:20.90]Dude, I'm trying to time the dodge on you.
[243:23.10]Oh my goodness gracious!
[243:28.30]Get him!
[243:29.08]Please!
[243:29.62]R1!
[243:46.50]You fucking annoying little shit.
[244:11.95]Get down!
[244:12.71]Oh my god!
[244:13.75]Alright, it's gonna work.
[244:16.29]It's gonna work.
[244:31.68]Oh, this run back is such a pain in the absolute fucking dick.
[244:35.09]I swear to God.
[244:35.91]Okay.
[244:40.99]That strategy worked.
[244:41.93]I have to just get in there and just wail.
[244:45.53]Enchant the flail?
[244:48.54]Does it work on weapons like this?
[244:54.66]I thought it only worked on, like, swords.
[244:56.64]Sorry.
[245:06.21]It actually works on the flail?
[245:10.03]Okay.
[245:10.55]Alright, let's sit down.
[245:17.60]Oh, where is it?
[245:18.38]Memorize.
[245:21.86]Okay.
[245:28.55]Someone's an ancestral follower.
[245:30.09]I can't summon Oleg.
[245:31.71]Do I have enough to summon him?
[245:37.84]How much FP do I have?
[245:40.30]Okay, yeah.
[245:40.90]Let's try this guy.
[245:41.50]Alright, let's do it.
[245:50.51]I didn't even want to press that button twice.
[245:52.41]I just, like... There's just so many buttons.
[245:55.51]Get up!
[246:03.45]He hates the boys.
[246:11.09]You can try parrying, too.
[246:14.85]That guy is really predictable.
[246:16.67]I'm always afraid to parry bosses because I feel like half the time it just doesn't do anything.
[246:19.29]But those aren't even bosses.
[246:21.61]They're just like those crystal people that were outside.
[246:29.19]Like, give me... Like, I went the wrong fucking way, but it doesn't... Like, running through this shit sucks, asshole.
[246:44.24]5k gone, but it fucking doesn't really matter.
[246:50.66]It's to the right, not to the left.
[246:51.76]How's the pain?
[247:02.31]Uh, well, the game is annoying sometimes, right?
[247:08.27]But that's just the way it is.
[247:18.27]Okay... Would help if the game didn't hang for three seconds when I turned the fucking corner!
[247:40.11]I don't have enough mana to summon my friend!
[247:52.77]It's a wash.
[248:05.05]What the fuck is that move?
[248:07.03]I can't parry with the shield.
[248:10.81]Why was I just going like... Oh, it's because I weapon art with the flail.
[248:15.02]Okay, so I can't do both because otherwise I can't summon the guy.
[248:20.41]I was trying to parry, but I have the magic defense shield on.
[248:23.27]Okay, here.
[248:34.10]So I can't do both.
[248:35.64]I have to... Okay.
[248:41.44]Unless I want to bring mana potions, which I could.
[248:48.82]I'll bring one mana potion.
[248:52.65]I want to try to parry this guy.
[248:53.81]Okay, so let's go.
[248:58.43]Enough of this fucking horse shit.
[249:11.33]The red shirt's fueling his anger.
[249:15.40]This run back is awful though, because all it takes is just one little, like, dinky little bullet to hit you in the back.
[249:23.73]And that's it.
[249:24.49]And you're going to just say, That's what I'm saying.
[249:30.69]That's exactly what I'm saying.
[249:31.53]I'm just saying.
[249:38.66]Motherfuckers.
[249:40.02]Hold on a second.
[249:40.54]The game has to, like, load the shaders for 15 straight seconds.
[249:44.00]Okay, now we can play.
[250:02.32]Let's go.
[250:09.53]Oh, he's got a bow.
[250:13.51]He did one damage.
[250:16.21]What?
[250:17.85]He sucks.
[250:19.24]He did one damage.
[250:26.48]My god, why did you tell me to bring this guy?
[250:28.66]Why did you tell me to bring him?
[250:36.00]One damage!
[250:42.43]Alright, it's time to parry this fuckface.
[250:46.33]You can't parry him!
[250:57.57]You can.
[250:57.87]You can.
[250:58.25]You can.
[250:58.63]You can.
[250:59.05]You can.
[250:59.47]You can.
[250:59.85]You can.
[251:00.23]You can.
[251:00.61]Okay, just keep doing that.
[251:02.99]Keep doing that.
[251:03.81]We're good.
[251:04.59]We're good.
[251:04.95]We're not good.
[251:07.94]You fucking piece of shit with your spam.
[251:28.01]He needs to be leveled up for something, man, because that's bad.
[251:30.97]No, you are not hitting me with all of those.
[251:44.63]What the fuck?
[251:45.65]I just want to grab these guys by their fucking heads.
[251:51.51]Just like three stooges just... Just shatter both their brains and their heads.
[251:58.10]Like, why can't I just grab them by the heads and just three stooges crush their heads?
[252:02.93]Oh, shit.
[252:03.41]Atrioc puts up.
[252:05.83]Welcome, raiders.
[252:08.79]Currently dealing with a little bit of a problem here.
[252:12.21]Thanks for the raid, Atrioc.
[252:16.45]I've got these two crystal idiots down here, and I'm having some trouble.
[252:20.57]Chat told me to summon this guy with the horns.
[252:22.89]The guy did literally one damage.
[252:25.35]I wish I was making that up.
[252:26.81]I summoned him, took a whole mana bar.
[252:28.19]He did one damage.
[252:30.12]One damage point.
[252:31.66]And then they ate him alive.
[252:34.14]So we're going to change it up.
[252:34.98]We're going to go back to the boys.
[252:35.90]No, we're not.
[252:38.22]I'll tell you what we're doing.
[252:41.40]We're bringing in the dogs.
[252:43.72]The dogs are vicious.
[252:49.42]go I'll be I saw you've been playing it too and I hopefully you're doing okay you caught me right in the middle of a uh I'm a little upset try to calm down I'm gonna try to get this to work so let's let's go ahead and get started okay I'm happy everything's fine I have to level these people up like I can't just have them at level one although uh alright I'm gonna get it this time because I'm gonna just
[253:20.15]Here we go.
[253:30.62]Everything is not cool.
[253:31.88]Everything is going to be just fine.
[253:33.34]I promise.
[253:33.76]Okay.
[254:10.41]Everything's gonna be just fine.
[254:12.17]And I can tell you right now.
[254:14.37]There's no reason for everybody to freak out.
[254:29.29]You.
[254:30.51]No, you.
[254:40.86]Little fuck hesitated.
[254:54.80]Can't bring him back out?
[255:03.11]Why is he doing a different move?
[255:04.17]We've been doing the same move the whole time!
[255:06.17]He decides to change instead of going... He goes like... What was this new move set?
[255:22.01]Try guard parrying?
[255:24.33]No, guard parry is not going to be a good idea, because guard parry, the caster guy throws his fucking goddamn fruity pebbles at me from across the room, and I'm vulnerable if I do a guard parry.
[255:44.70]I have to go, okay, I'm going to kill these guys.
[255:47.02]These guys are not even that big of a deal, they're really not.
[255:54.24]It's gonna come down to parry, get him, run.
[255:59.40]Run, parry, get him, run.
[256:03.08]Parry, run, get him.
[256:07.19]And don't get hit by like the 30 people in here that cast the same fucking spell at you like that.
[256:13.87]He's still shooting it.
[256:14.73]He's shooting it at me.
[256:15.63]He's still shooting it.
[256:16.47]I don't know which direction he's shooting it, but he's doing it.
[256:18.76]Okay.
[256:23.72]It's gonna have to be... It's gonna have to be... I gotta bring the boys out.
[256:26.55]Either that or we gotta try the other.
[256:27.75]Because the boys are just annoying.
[256:29.09]They just get all over the place.
[256:31.35]I'm gonna upgrade the boys.
[256:32.19]The boys are just annoying.
[256:38.13]Right?
[256:38.51]They're annoying.
[256:41.80]They just walk around and bump into walls and shit. ...
[257:00.25]Hurry and get it off before this idiot does anything!
[257:17.30]You fuck!
[257:27.64]Alright, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away.
[257:29.90]Wait till he does the... Line of sight with the statues.
[257:38.24]That's the plan right now.
[257:39.22]Check this out.
[257:48.25]Strategy!
[258:07.05]Excuse me?
[258:19.24]I tried to walk off, but I couldn't.
[258:35.12]Yep.
[258:39.26]It's broken.
[258:39.70]Okay.
[258:40.08]Alright.
[259:04.91]I just have to run.
[259:08.57]Fuck that rock!
[259:35.78]Wow geez!
[259:36.50]Ow ow ow!
[259:37.74]Slow down.
[260:14.44]Don't let him do anything else!
[260:15.50]Oh, yeah!
[260:18.14]Crystal release.
[260:19.61]Nice.
[260:31.06]I'm telling you, the strategy was you got to line of sight with the first guy.
[260:37.62]I lost 5,000 souls and I'm not happy about it.
[260:39.76]I'm very upset about it.
[260:46.19]What is this?
[260:52.43]Oh, nice.
[260:57.63]Holy shit, I was on camera.
[260:58.49]You got to see what it looked like.
[261:09.95]Where does this go?
[261:17.34]Crystal release.
[261:19.12]Raise a massive crystal, then shadows it to scour a wide area with a violent rain.
[261:25.84]So is that the thing where it was just around me?
[261:27.34]I want to try it.
[261:35.27]Uh, there's an exit dungeon, but hold on.
[261:38.37]Where does this go?
[261:38.98]Machinima shield.
[261:56.59]That's actually pretty funny.
[262:09.72]That was a good call, though, to take that off.
[262:11.28]Academy of... Wait, what?
[262:24.95]What the fuck?
[262:29.43]I'm back at the academy.
[262:40.61]Hold the lever.
[262:44.37]This is a different area of the academy.
[262:46.77]I can't.
[262:50.56]Soggy or crunchy cereal, bro?
[262:51.96]Please.
[262:52.74]Why would you ever eat cereal soggy?
[262:55.78]You guys are eating cereal wrong, by the way.
[262:57.28]Let me tell you how to fix it.
[262:59.97]So... You only eat... Only eat... Pour a little bit of cereal in... And a little bit of milk.
[263:08.33]You eat that first.
[263:09.84]Don't, like, dump... People dump, like, three or four cups of fucking cereal... Just mass cereal in their bowl.
[263:16.02]And then they... You just dump milk in there... And then it just becomes a mess.
[263:20.72]Sometimes you don't even eat all of it.
[263:22.56]You do, like, half a cup of cereal... And then, like, a little bit... Like, a quarter cup of milk... Half a cup of milk...
[263:28.38]Eat that.
[263:29.00]It's going to be crunchy and perfect.
[263:31.50]Then just do a little bit more.
[263:32.36]Pour a little bit more in the bowl, a little bit more milk.
[263:34.33]I don't know how people keep getting this wrong.
[263:43.79]What?
[263:43.93]This is just like a secret chest?
[263:48.63]Terra Magicus.
[263:53.31]Terra Magicus.
[263:57.08]Raises the magic strength of those within the sigil.
[264:02.11]What?
[264:02.29]I don't get it.
[264:07.13]Is it just like a buff?
[264:12.15]Okay, this is a glint stone.
[264:13.47]Draws an academy sigil upon the ground, raising the magic strength of those within it.
[264:18.71]So I put a sigil on the ground and then I can just, bam.
[264:22.50]It's a buff?
[264:25.32]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[264:27.33]Hell yeah, nice.
[264:33.45]Nice.
[264:34.13]Alright, awesome.
[264:36.94]Can you yell a little less?
[264:38.58]Uh, I don't think that's gonna happen.
[264:39.40]I'm sorry, man.
[264:53.80]Talk to the sorcerer about the gate key with the new opening.
[264:57.10]Uh, I do have to go talk to that guy, but I can't give it to him.
[265:01.06]Maybe he'll tell me where another one is?
[265:09.70]Fast travel from here.
[265:13.32]Uh, yeah, let me go talk to him, so he says.
[265:17.94]This is it, right?
[265:18.60]Yeah, it's right here.
[265:19.16]Okay, where is it?
[265:24.17]Yeah, church.
[265:24.77]The church of the Earth, right?
[265:28.00]Yeah, it's right there.
[265:30.88]Alright.
[265:34.57]Huh?
[265:38.63]Huh?
[265:39.17]Oh, right here.
[265:43.77]These are great runes.
[265:45.29]I don't know what those are.
[265:51.46]Is this the right place?
[265:54.50]No, it's this church, right?
[266:06.40]You got them from the boss?
[266:08.08]Yeah, that's right.
[266:10.90]Are you going to start vaping?
[266:19.27]I'm not going to start vaping.
[266:22.53]I'm the first enough.
[266:26.23]One second.
[266:29.39]I can't give it to him.
[266:30.31]What if I... Am I going to screw everything up here if I give this to him?
[266:36.36]It said I can't give it to anybody.
[266:37.68]I don't know.
[266:44.84]What happens if I do it?
[266:47.54]I'm kind of scared.
[266:49.76]So you found yourself a glintstone key.
[266:52.57]But I certainly can't take it from you.
[266:54.47]That key belongs to you.
[266:55.91]By rights, you should use it for yourself.
[266:58.13]It's true.
[266:59.61]I wish to return to my place of study.
[267:01.73]But that's no excuse to impose upon others.
[267:04.21]Ugh.
[267:05.66]Okay, so where's another one?
[267:06.90]Dude, is there another one in the second... There's a second key in the academy?
[267:11.82]Alright.
[267:12.02]Do I just go get it?
[267:38.46]Academy Grand Library.
[267:39.64]And Academy Gate.
[267:44.48]I mean, there's... I don't know where to start.
[267:47.62]Would it be somewhere in here?
[267:48.42]A parlor, schoolhouse.
[267:59.81]It looks like the only place I really haven't been is here.
[268:01.49]So I'm going to go to the church and go backwards.
[268:04.96]Like this way.
[268:08.23]I was going to put a marker here and just whatever.
[268:09.88]Uh, why do you hate crack?
[268:23.48]What are you talking about?
[268:29.10]People keep saying you need to use your great runes.
[268:31.08]I have to go to the place where I can use them.
[268:34.00]It's like the tower, right?
[268:38.10]There's a tower that I haven't gone to yet.
[268:40.38]That... I don't know, like, is it over here?
[268:46.32]I take it to a tower.
[268:48.54]I'm imagining this is the tower, if I were to take a guess.
[268:51.90]I will go do that afterwards.
[268:58.90]Alright, so now... The play is to try to go this way.
[269:02.26]I think.
[269:06.02]See if I can... Can I get in there from here?
[269:11.11]I don't know if I can get over here from there.
[269:14.79]Hmm.
[269:18.61]There's another section in this academy.
[269:21.71]Maybe from here?
[269:22.23]Okay, let's try this.
[269:36.66]If I head over here...
[269:41.58]This is where those water wheel is.
[269:46.78]Which I need to be this way.
[269:51.85]So it looks like there's a path here somewhere.
[269:53.77]Hold on.
[269:54.13]Up this again.
[270:01.75]No, I'm not doing the water wheel.
[270:02.79]I've got to find a way over this way.
[270:04.49]Down here.
[270:10.70]Yep.
[270:15.00]I'm just gonna run because I've already done this like five times I know I'll clear this because this plot the big pots there is this area this is where I fought the boss
[270:42.88]Is there another way to keep going from the boss's chamber?
[270:48.28]But I didn't see.
[270:48.76]If it was that way... What if you were like my dentist?
[271:02.67]Okay, so... I remember this.
[271:09.33]Was there another way to go?
[271:17.07]That way?
[271:24.55]Spam mage isn't fun?
[271:29.21]That could be annoying, yeah.
[271:38.04]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[271:39.38]Maybe over there?
[271:46.24]Like, that way.
[271:47.46]Have I been there?
[271:48.57]I don't think I've been there yet.
[272:06.40]Alright, you're kind of making this a real pain in the ass for me right now.
[272:15.01]I can't just cheese you.
[272:23.09]Oh, my God.
[272:23.69]Fuck all of you.
[272:31.61]Okay.
[272:33.48]Oh, that's right.
[272:34.48]That's right.
[272:35.16]That's right.
[272:35.62]That's right.
[272:36.00]That's right.
[272:36.40]I didn't go.
[272:36.82]I remember I looked over here and I was like, oh, yeah.
[272:38.72]Yeah, I didn't do it.
[272:40.78]Okay, here we go.
[272:43.55]That's right.
[272:44.31]I did look over here and I said, whoa, maybe later.
[272:48.77]The thing with FromSoftwareGames is maybe later means never again.
[272:52.36]I will never look at this part of the game ever again.
[272:56.18]So you're right.
[272:57.34]Let's go.
[273:08.93]Ouch.
[273:09.59]Oh, it's him.
[273:10.01]I'm back.
[273:16.87]I got bad sorceries on for this.
[273:21.14]Just gonna go weapons.
[273:27.44]We're just gonna go with the two-handed.
[273:28.98]Alright, that's that way.
[273:36.83]Cool.
[273:38.29]Repog.
[273:40.88]Repog champ.
[273:44.68]IRL pony ride stream, waiting room.
[273:48.72]That would be so fucked up.
[273:54.49]It would be the most, that would be one of the most boring streams you probably would ever see here.
[274:01.33]Just riding a pony.
[274:03.57]I imagine with a GoPro here.
[274:04.99]Just looking down, just... Every so often you just hear like...
[274:16.29]And then like the big horse sneezes like... Somebody under that?
[274:29.62]Nope.
[274:31.29]Okay.
[274:31.49]I had to check.
[274:43.59]Oh, they're axes.
[274:45.01]Yeah, I see.
[274:46.03]Okay.
[274:47.69]Good try.
[274:53.51]Good try.
[274:55.06]I can't really cast any spells, so we're gonna have to do this.
[275:01.66]Didn't think you were gonna attack.
[275:06.14]Nice try.
[275:11.28]Pull them each.
[275:15.67]What the fuck is that move?
[275:17.13]I want it.
[275:23.97]Oh shit.
[275:24.45]This is bad.
[275:26.05]That's not what I wanted to have happen at all.
[275:34.86]Yikes.
[275:38.38]It's coming.
[275:45.68]Dammit, it's a freaking cage.
[275:51.66]Everything is fine.
[276:01.53]I went- I just got so slumped down.
[276:03.19]I was like, this sucks.
[276:05.85]We're good, though.
[276:14.40]Pain in the ass.
[276:23.25]Progress.
[276:23.61]Let's go.
[276:28.57]I wonder if
[276:40.34]All these rooftops.
[276:43.62]There might be another boss up here, too.
[276:45.26]That'd be cool.
[276:45.70]Meteor bolt.
[276:46.26]Cool.
[276:47.80]Oh, cool.
[276:48.06]What's that cool?
[276:48.74]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[276:50.04]That's cool.
[276:50.28]What is that?
[276:51.07]Cool.
[276:54.99]Nothing else?
[276:55.29]Looks like we're jumping.
[276:59.67]Why are you mocking yourself?
[277:08.68]Um, I don't know.
[277:11.38]I hope this doesn't hurt.
[277:30.07]Right to my marker.
[277:31.15]Perfect.
[277:31.51]Exactly where I wanted to go.
[277:32.51]There's no way I make that jump.
[277:55.49]Being thorough.
[278:08.87]Uh... I could go... Uh... Here?
[278:15.76]That guy's scary looking.
[278:19.60]I wish I had a sorcerer to kill him with, but I don't.
[278:21.72]And he's gonna- Oh god, this is bad.
[278:23.00]Alright.
[278:27.73]Oh, it's just an archer.
[278:28.55]Alright, never mind.
[278:32.11]Is that over there?
[278:33.29]Um, I'm gonna get that.
[278:36.63]I'm gonna have to go all the way back around and back up, but that's an item that I want.
[278:45.57]Imbued sword key.
[278:46.91]That's different.
[278:49.88]What is an imbued sword key?
[278:51.12]I'll have to check it.
[278:59.66]What the fuck?
[279:12.26]Oh, shit.
[279:13.64]Uh, there's a lot of places I can go.
[279:15.28]I... Can I go back over here?
[279:20.55]Did you take a break?
[279:24.09]Uh, yeah, I did already.
[279:25.05]I'm gonna take a food break here, maybe.
[279:27.05]Later.
[279:33.34]You check around every single building because they put stuff everywhere.
[279:37.88]You never know when you're going to find something that you need.
[279:43.48]Alright, do I go down the ladder or do I just jump over the rooftops?
[279:47.88]I'm marking it.
[279:55.11]Oh, fuck.
[280:03.64]I wonder if there's another boss that bait was so annoying and I'm in trouble now
[280:37.30]Okay.
[280:37.44]We can go down here.
[280:47.79]Which leads to... I've already been here.
[280:51.47]But have I been?
[280:52.53]I don't know.
[280:53.19]Have I been at that level of the roof?
[280:57.90]I'm not going to go down yet because there's an area to go this way to.
[281:01.76]What the fuck was that?
[281:02.96]I have no health.
[281:07.10]This is bad.
[281:16.75]Oh, I remember looking up here.
[281:19.42]Seeing that.
[281:20.14]Is that a lie?
[281:20.88]It might be.
[281:43.60]That was such an ugly face, I hate that one.
[281:50.61]I did not like that one.
[281:57.65]I got a key!
[281:59.55]After all that, I still kind of want to...
[282:06.38]There's the main... There's the... Where was it?
[282:08.86]Where was it?
[282:09.84]Where was it?
[282:10.50]I keep forgetting.
[282:14.10]Here.
[282:14.32]Where's the court... How... Where's the courtroom?
[282:17.83]Because I want to go back up there.
[282:23.49]There's a classroom in your run-through, and then the courtroom... Courthouse is, like, here.
[282:28.11]Courtyard.
[282:28.55]Hey!
[282:31.36]Hey!
[282:43.25]I've been up here?
[282:49.06]I haven't even been up here.
[282:54.24]Luzuli Glintstone Sword.
[282:57.04]That's different.
[283:00.41]Oh, shit.
[283:00.95]I gotta be careful.
[283:01.73]Get the item.
[283:03.41]Shattering Crystal.
[283:04.73]Oh!
[283:04.91]Ah!
[283:27.14]Yeah, right!
[283:27.94]What was the last one?
[283:29.18]One, two, three, four, five.
[283:32.25]One, two, three, four.
[283:49.84]I kicked the ladder down?
[283:50.54]Oh my goodness gracious.
[283:52.42]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[283:53.44]Hell yeah.
[283:53.90]This definitely leads to something.
[284:00.90]Oh fuck!
[284:15.17]That's how unfair was that?
[284:21.67]We won't back up?
[284:23.60]I try to hit him, I bump into him, slash him, and he just... What?
[284:26.44]Alright, where the fuck is that?
[284:30.56]I just knocked a ladder down.
[284:34.48]Where's that ladder?
[284:37.05]I don't know where I am.
[284:40.53]The room where you just came from.
[284:44.99]But where?
[284:46.70]First... Grace.
[284:51.66]Uh... Where was that?
[284:55.18]This one here?
[284:55.66]Vape parlor.
[285:03.44]Look at your spells.
[285:11.25]Oh, you're right.
[285:11.71]Okay.
[285:12.15]Let me change my spells.
[285:20.34]That cannot stay on.
[285:21.46]I'm gonna go back to Swift Glintstone.
[285:23.06]We're gonna change this to... Man, I need more intelligence.
[285:33.02]Let's do the the pole.
[285:34.48]Pole's pretty good.
[285:38.24]Alright, so I can see where I died on the map.
[285:40.75]Oh, fuck.
[285:44.13]That's in the church.
[285:57.55]I died, like, over here.
[285:58.43]Thank you.
[286:25.08]Please read, I'm your biological son and I just found your channel.
[286:42.45]That would be weird.
[286:46.77]I don't think so.
[286:50.88]I'm your biological son and I just found your channel.
[286:56.03]That's so stupid.
[287:02.54]You're heir, heir to the Jerma Empire.
[287:19.40]Okay, so now that I did that, let's browse around.
[287:28.45]You just don't give a shit at all, do you?
[287:47.06]You still got it off?
[287:48.34]I don't think so.
[287:51.89]I think I already have one of those.
[287:57.21]Germapiss Empire.
[287:58.29]Does this do anything for me?
[288:10.92]Not really.
[288:11.32]This one just has more armor.
[288:15.12]This one's better.
[288:16.02]Are you looking for the Whopper secret formula?
[288:26.07]That was actually a pretty good one.
[288:34.48]Alright, so that.
[288:40.72]What's in you?
[288:42.14]Twin sage glintstone crown.
[288:51.35]What?
[288:54.38]Greatly increases intelligence to the detriment of HP and stamina.
[289:04.90]Oh, I don't want to wear this.
[289:06.06]This looks awful.
[289:10.42]It's a double whopper.
[289:11.36]28, 29, 30, 30.
[289:18.28]Is 3 intelligence really worth losing like almost 100 in HP?
[289:24.25]I don't know.
[289:24.65]I don't think so.
[289:31.48]I really don't.
[289:32.16]I really don't think so.
[289:32.84]I got the new sword.
[289:35.60]Oh yeah, that's right.
[289:41.08]Not as good.
[289:44.85]Not as good.
[289:45.37]Because this scales E with dex.
[289:55.36]Deals magic damage.
[289:56.44]Apparently once used to staff a sorcery.
[289:58.52]It's got glintstone pebble.
[290:00.86]I already have that.
[290:04.06]I already own it.
[290:05.50]Fuck stats.
[290:08.86]Make a cute outfit.
[290:14.45]Make a cute outfit.
[290:18.50]How many big bosses have you beat?
[290:19.78]I've done... Okay.
[290:22.28]Uh... How many... Actually, this is a good time to think about this for a second.
[290:26.06]How many bosses have I beat in the game so far?
[290:31.11]How many?
[290:33.51]Like, eight?
[290:33.97]Nine?
[290:34.21]Ten?
[290:42.50]Two main?
[290:43.36]No, there's definitely been three or four main.
[290:52.25]Remember, you need to see this.
[290:55.51]I see it right now, and I don't want to show that on stream.
[290:59.21]It's fucking... I hate it.
[291:01.61]It's... It's scary.
[291:08.64]This is scary.
[291:09.90]It looks like my jaw is unhinged and shit.
[291:13.74]No, I'm not showing that.
[291:15.00]I'm the streamer.
[291:15.66]I get to decide.
[291:21.02]No, it's fucking horrifying.
[291:23.52]I hate every- because you took my real teeth.
[291:25.56]Are those my real teeth that you just like photoshopped in?
[291:30.72]Alright, maybe that is worth showing on stream because I'm actually really curious.
[291:40.18]Oh, I- this is awful.
[291:41.78]It looks like a horror game or something.
[291:43.76]I fucking hate this.
[291:50.46]This looks scary.
[291:51.28]It looks like a horror game.
[291:51.96]I don't know.
[292:03.63]Why can't I show it?
[292:11.45]Where is it?
[292:11.75]Fuck.
[292:18.41]I just saved it.
[292:20.67]It's possessed.
[292:21.35]Alright, well, that's weird.
[292:28.89]How come I can't show this?
[292:31.03]I have an idea.
[292:35.01]My computer's fucking weird, man.
[292:36.23]I swear to God.
[292:48.32]Where is it?
[292:49.95]I just saved it.
[292:50.73]It doesn't make any sense.
[292:54.15]It's like there's no images that I have.
[292:56.77]Apparently zero images are on my desktop.
[292:58.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[293:03.15]Those are my real teeth, I think.
[293:20.38]Are they?
[293:24.30]Did you take... No, you didn't.
[293:26.56]Did you?
[293:27.26]Where did you get these teeth?
[293:37.65]Are they different?
[293:38.99]They are.
[293:39.97]I have a little thing here.
[293:41.36]They are different.
[293:48.06]I hate that.
[293:53.50]You found somebody, wait.
[293:56.35]Are these my teeth from like seven or eight years ago?
[294:05.83]It's an AI app.
[294:07.07]Oh.
[294:07.83]I thought you took, like, a photo... That would be pretty funny.
[294:10.94]And I don't want to give you content ideas, but, like, if you had taken, like, my teeth from, like, a decade ago, like, right?
[294:17.32]From, like, a face cam video from, like, ten years ago or something.
[294:21.16]And, like, photoshopped my teeth on it.
[294:23.32]That... And look at how fucking... I hate it.
[294:29.56]It's just unsettling and makes me feel like shit looking at it.
[294:39.43]Have your teeth changed?
[294:40.29]Yeah.
[294:41.35]I think a little bit.
[294:42.01]I've got like a little space here now that I didn't have like seven or eight years ago.
[294:49.84]My teeth have moved a little bit.
[294:54.08]Okay, so let me get back to this.
[295:01.02]Uh, I don't think it's worth using, but I'll try it for a little while.
[295:10.79]That's pretty cool.
[295:11.59]Alright, so now what?
[295:15.41]Okay, go back up to the roof.
[295:18.45]I wonder if there's another boss here.
[295:19.49]There might be.
[295:21.49]Wait.
[295:33.71]No.
[295:41.43]But yeah, so I've beaten like three main or four main story bosses.
[295:47.51]Christ.
[295:49.93]And what, like five or six just non-story optional bosses?
[296:01.40]You guys don't get up, right?
[296:03.83]That guy has a crossbow.
[296:19.38]That was just instant.
[296:28.32]I thought he was going to shoot one.
[296:33.50]He might drop that.
[296:43.90]No, please!
[296:45.91]No!
[296:45.97]7000 souls!
[296:46.39]They're gone.
[296:47.33]They're gone.
[297:00.86]Whatever.
[297:04.02]They're gone.
[297:04.70]Whatever.
[297:05.04]I didn't want them anyways.
[297:05.98]Just dead weight.
[297:32.28]What?
[297:32.68]Where did he go?
[297:33.52]Who hit that guy?
[297:34.20]Did you shoot him?
[297:46.61]What the fuck?
[297:48.63]You gonna cry, bud?
[298:02.97]What do I think of Elden Ring so far?
[298:04.45]It's... It's very good.
[298:09.67]I'm glad these guys exist.
[298:27.77]How is he still alive?
[298:29.55]What the fuck are you talking about?
[298:31.21]How?
[298:43.35]Oh shit!
[298:45.59]Out of magical power!
[299:04.30]Right.
[299:04.48]So now.
[299:06.54]Uh, this guy.
[299:08.20]Long hallway.
[299:09.41]He fires.
[299:10.11]I just dodge through it.
[299:13.45]I imagine we're just gonna run at him and he doesn't have a chance.
[299:20.74]Jesus, man.
[299:21.62]I- what he- he- uh, okay.
[299:25.82]Damn.
[299:27.54]I was supposed to take off my staff and start to play.
[299:45.71]That thing's cool, but I want health.
[300:09.79]Can I reach?
[300:35.66]Alright.
[300:36.54]My god.
[300:40.22]guy's a pain in the ass I gotta go in there ready I might just try to block or I mean he it's
[301:07.10]There's something funny.
[301:37.50]so so
[302:08.43]WAH!
[302:20.03]Fucking cheese, man.
[302:32.39]What the fuck?
[302:40.23]Azure's Glintstone Staff.
[302:43.07]Now this looks to be a real staff.
[302:48.51]One that I am very much excited about.
[302:58.15]Reduces cast time of all sorceries but consumes more FP.
[303:05.62]Reduce cast time though.
[303:06.72]That's huge because of the dexterity I'm building.
[303:18.77]And look at how cool it looks.
[303:27.67]What does dex have to do with cast time?
[303:29.11]In this game, in Elden Ring, dexterity reduces cast time.
[303:37.48]Let me just see what the difference is.
[303:57.13]That's pretty significant.
[304:00.11]And especially doing Dexterity.
[304:02.81]I think this is the one.
[304:03.97]I need 52 Intelligence, though.
[304:10.67]It's time to start beefing up, Int.
[304:19.28]Alright, well that's really, really cool.
[304:22.03]I know there's another place I can go on the rooftops, but I'd like to... I've only done one or two real encounters, like bosses in the game so far.
[304:30.43]I've spent the last like five hours kind of exploring some of this other stuff.
[304:34.67]I want to try to do this area here.
[304:39.35]Maybe like over here.
[304:41.43]Or up here.
[304:43.25]If not there, then I really want to do maybe like up here.
[304:48.65]This way.
[304:51.54]Or, first of all, I want to go here because I think I need to for progression.
[304:58.10]I also... I'm going to take a quick break.
[305:03.28]I want to pee.
[305:04.95]I'll be back.
[305:06.75]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[305:07.89]Pee break.
[305:11.57]And the key, right?
[305:12.63]I'll mark it all.
[305:13.21]Let me mark it.
[305:16.07]So, everything on the map has significance and something I actually really have to do.
[305:23.17]I'm going to get rid of this because... Okay.
[305:28.07]So, it's glintstone key.
[305:31.15]Tower place.
[305:32.79]And then... Up here.
[305:37.42]These are the places I want to go.
[305:42.62]And I am going to... I think that's everything I can do here.
[305:45.58]So, I'm going to port out.
[305:47.46]I know this probably... There's one other place I didn't go on the roof, but...
[305:51.43]You know what?
[305:51.93]I mean, I got to... Maybe I'll come back later.
[305:53.93]I want to progress up north more.
[305:59.61]So we are going to port out.
[306:03.11]I'm going to go here.
[306:06.49]Through the main... No, not the main gate.
[306:08.42]Like here.
[306:10.98]And go to the tower.
[306:15.28]I'll be right back.
[306:16.50]See you guys in a minute.
[307:10.43]Thank you.
[308:44.18]So,
[309:31.37]Oh, I cleared my throat.
[309:32.19]That's how they know I'm back.
[309:35.51]Flintstones.
[309:36.55]Meet the Flintstones.
[309:39.75]Modern Stone Age.
[309:40.43]What kind of tea do you drink?
[309:51.65]It's matcha.
[309:53.49]Matcha powder.
[309:56.55]Green tea.
[310:00.47]Yep.
[310:08.71]Irma, you're a basic white girl.
[310:20.84]What?
[310:22.96]It's my- I like matcha.
[310:25.06]It's- hey, you know what?
[310:27.28]Okay.
[310:28.76]Okay.
[310:30.36]Do you see how- how powerful this is making me?
[310:38.17]You see how powerful this is making me over the last four days?
[310:51.80]Macha can be enjoyed by anybody.
[310:54.68]And everyone.
[310:55.58]And I'm going to enjoy some right now.
[311:12.63]I just put a little too much.
[311:15.55]Macha, Macha Man?
[311:19.67]Macha, Macha Man.
[311:23.83]I wanna be a Macha Man.
[311:27.26]Macha, Macha, Macha Man.
[311:29.96]That was funny.
[311:35.60]Okay.
[311:39.80]It was for one second, but I... Okay, I went a full two seconds too long.
[311:47.31]It's a type of green tea.
[311:49.93]Powder form.
[311:50.53]Don't overdo it, though.
[311:52.79]It's pretty good for you.
[311:54.51]It's got caffeine in it.
[311:56.17]I mean, not as much as a bunch of espresso or anything, but you know what I mean.
[312:01.70]Green tea is just good for you anyways.
[312:02.74]I would recommend people be drinking it.
[312:06.08]Just regularly anyways, because it's just good for you.
[312:10.28]It's a different kind of caffeine buzz than you get when you drink coffee.
[312:15.67]Doesn't have very much.
[312:16.27]What do you like for a brand?
[312:22.15]I'm still figuring that out.
[312:24.79]I can't give you a full recommendation yet.
[312:26.59]I'm still figuring that out.
[312:33.19]Matcha was not allowed during Prohibition.
[312:44.90]Alright, we need to go that way.
[312:47.80]So I gotta get on this bridge down here somehow.
[312:51.78]I'm gonna go ahead and do the fucking famed castle skip.
[312:57.60]Nailed it.
[312:58.08]Perfectly.
[312:58.52]Here.
[313:12.73]And on this bridge over... Where's this bridge that I'm supposed to find?
[313:17.27]That way?
[313:17.91]Or is it?
[313:23.48]Where is it?
[313:26.64]Here.
[313:33.74]I kind of don't know.
[313:39.57]Hmm.
[313:47.56]Came on the wrong side.
[313:58.36]Just go to the front door.
[314:00.92]Uh... I don't know.
[314:10.18]Kind of don't know how to get there.
[314:18.26]Alright, don't aggro the entire village.
[314:21.36]The front door is probably where I need to go.
[314:22.66]Do they follow me down here?
[314:33.57]No.
[314:36.20]Wait!
[314:37.96]What about... What about that dog with the knife in his mouth?
[314:44.60]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[314:46.84]Remember that crazy, like, wolf with a knife in his mouth?
[314:50.70]He was ram... Where is that?
[314:52.40]I think that's right here.
[315:05.41]Isn't that dog down here?
[315:09.09]Okay, hold on.
[315:10.67]Where's that dog?
[315:14.11]Right there.
[315:14.75]Right there.
[315:15.41]Yep.
[315:16.04]I remember now.
[315:19.52]Let's kill this guy.
[315:30.53]Okay.
[315:30.97]Well...
[315:48.29]Oh my god, man.
[315:57.47]He crushed me?
[315:59.21]Jesus!
[315:59.75]Can you imagine even trying to fight this guy like 15, 20 levels ago?
[316:32.05]Kill him!
[316:32.73]He's in front of you!
[317:03.24]I didn't dodge!
[317:16.46]Oh, fuck off!
[317:17.48]That stupid spin!
[317:22.38]That like, little wham at the end.
[317:24.38]Fuck you!
[317:33.74]That little, like, oh, oops!
[317:35.60]I'm gonna turn instantly and hit you!
[317:37.30]Oh, fuck, I don't wanna be here, I wanna be here.
[317:42.20]Yeah, here.
[317:56.86]This is stupid.
[317:58.26]I had it too.
[317:59.94]That fucker was dead.
[318:02.46]I could have... Okay, that's why greed is good.
[318:05.46]I'm never fucking not listening to my gut again.
[318:08.51]I had an opportunity to hit him a third time and kill him.
[318:12.01]But I was like, no, don't do that.
[318:14.37]That's a bad idea.
[318:15.91]Don't do that.
[318:18.08]And I would have won.
[318:31.94]First of all, I need to put both headphones in because I can't fucking hear anything.
[318:43.55]And these fucking guys gotta... I gotta get the boys here.
[318:57.10]Why can't I call them?
[319:00.45]Excuse me?
[319:00.85]Must be outside.
[319:20.98]Uh, what even hit me?
[319:22.35]Oh, this fucking dumbass.
[319:23.77]Get this stupid bow and arrow and shove it up your ass!
[319:27.01]Fuck you!
[319:28.31]God damn it!
[320:14.67]Beast blood.
[320:26.00]Old Fang.
[320:29.99]Nice job, boys.
[320:30.53]Nice work.
[320:43.12]Imagine like a neighbor.
[320:47.57]No, fuck you.
[320:49.29]Fuck you.
[320:50.59]You can take that bow and arrow and shove it up your ass.
[320:54.09]Bow and arrow?
[320:54.99]What's happening in there?
[321:02.28]Okay, this is the way I need to go.
[321:06.56]Who's he talking to?
[321:15.73]Ooh.
[321:16.11]This is cool.
[321:20.04]Is this the right way?
[321:20.58]This is the right way, right?
[321:26.92]Yeah.
[321:27.18]It has to be.
[321:31.20]Ooh.
[321:32.72]Missed an item.
[321:35.36]Did?
[321:36.69]Where?
[321:47.32]Missed item.
[321:49.52]Go over here.
[321:49.92]Over here.
[321:54.53]Up your ass.
[321:55.57]Nice.
[322:04.63]It's the bow.
[322:05.51]Over there, dude.
[322:06.74]What sword is this?
[322:07.60]It is the Carrion Night Sword.
[322:10.60]Really good if you're doing a... If you start as prisoner and you really want to be the sorry bastard that says, I want to do just decks and intelligence.
[322:19.82]It's the weapon for you.
[322:22.56]I like it so far.
[322:39.36]Ultimate Talisman.
[322:46.64]Lightning damage negation.
[322:47.92]Okay, I wonder why that's here.
[322:52.35]I wonder.
[322:54.53]I wonder if there's going to be some lightning damage.
[323:01.27]Give me one sec.
[323:01.73]Give me one sec.
[323:04.37]I'll be right back.
[323:10.87]Two seconds.
[324:46.89]I'll be right back.
[324:58.62]I'll be right back.
[325:12.89]Fresh cheeseburgers.
[325:20.76]I told you I was gonna eat!
[325:27.00]Wait.
[325:27.46]Both headphones gotta go on.
[325:37.63]He's really got Burger King.
[325:39.95]I have to play the part!
[326:07.73]Hey, why don't you send somebody that can actually fucking do... Oh, there's two of them.
[326:10.61]Never mind.
[326:12.59]There's three of them.
[326:13.67]Oh, shit!
[326:14.15]He just died.
[326:28.94]Get his power core out of his chest.
[326:35.42]Oh my god, that's way easier than I thought it was going to be.
[326:49.87]How come he doesn't have any... Why does he have more power core?
[326:56.38]How come you get extra power?
[326:58.80]What happened?
[327:16.16]Is the archer hit with an arrow?
[327:19.06]Really?
[327:19.36]We're gonna have a greasy cheeseburger controller?
[327:45.28]I'm not eating, like, a bag of potato chips.
[327:53.45]I would probably tell you that, like, just a cheeseburger from, like, Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, doesn't matter.
[327:59.79]That's not going to... You get a bun.
[328:01.37]It's not going to... There's not grease all over the bun.
[328:03.43]It's just bread.
[328:05.13]You're going to be fine.
[328:35.69]Burgers are greasy as fuck.
[328:36.87]Um, not this part.
[328:39.61]This is the part I'm touching.
[328:40.60]It's dry.
[328:41.34]It's dry, dry, dry, dry.
[328:42.88]This is bread.
[328:51.50]Where are you getting your burgers from?
[328:59.52]Show fingers or you're lying.
[329:00.82]Fine.
[329:06.26]Perfectly fine.
[329:17.75]Show the other hand.
[329:18.73]Fine.
[329:19.09]There's nothing on there.
[329:35.56]This is gonna make... This is gonna power me up for at least another 2-3 hours at least.
[329:43.08]Okay, so there's this teleporter.
[329:57.01]What about over here?
[330:02.29]Disgusting Daniel.
[330:04.92]It's easy.
[330:05.36]It's quick.
[330:05.98]Fast.
[330:06.28]Alright, I'm not going to eat steak on dinner.
[330:14.67]On stream.
[330:16.69]I'm not going to eat a piece of salmon on camera.
[330:40.78]Where's... I've been into a gross part.
[330:54.49]I've been into a gross part.
[330:56.33]I had to get out of my mouth.
[331:11.81]Ooh.
[331:18.99]Cotton?
[331:33.28]I should've wore Scarab.
[331:38.66]Alright, increases damage taken but reduces the FP cost of Ashes of War.
[331:57.97]You guys know how it is.
[331:58.55]Sometimes you just bite into like kind of a gross part and you want to get it out.
[332:15.20]Why are you eating by taking bites out of your table?
[332:27.77]I'm like eating my desk.
[332:36.79]There shouldn't be gross parts of things I'm eating.
[332:39.01]Sometimes you bite into a gross part!
[332:45.37]And you have to go like, ooh.
[332:49.13]So, I know some of you get it.
[332:50.29]It's like, two gross parts.
[333:26.95]Okay.
[333:37.92]Let me explain.
[333:39.48]Let me explain.
[333:40.44]For all the people here that are yelling at me, let me explain.
[333:48.60]When you eat something that has a consistent texture across the board,
[333:57.46]You know what each bite feels like.
[334:00.42]You know the texture.
[334:01.54]You know the give.
[334:03.66]When there's something off about that, when the texture changes in one of the bites, you kind of have to say, well, that's something different there.
[334:14.91]That's kind of weird.
[334:23.47]You get it.
[334:30.08]I'm ready.
[334:31.08]Oh my god, that sounded so awful.
[334:36.11]You ready?
[334:44.61]Here we go.
[334:47.91]It was fine.
[334:48.71]There's nothing wrong with it.
[334:51.93]He's actually attacked?
[335:05.37]Lots of eagles.
[335:05.89]If you need- Hey!
[335:06.35]If you need eagle feathers... They're here.
[335:11.95]Idiot.
[335:23.51]I was talking to me!
[335:25.65]I was making a reference to me like, hey, if you need them, they're here, idiot.
[335:28.39]Like talking to J- like Jeremy.
[335:29.84]Like self-referential humor.
[335:42.40]Dude, they don't stop moving.
[335:44.08]I'm trying to drink out of something that's empty.
[335:47.32]Okay, so what's at the very end?
[336:13.29]Was there no reason to come down here?
[336:14.35]Oh, fuck.
[336:17.99]Fuck.
[336:19.41]Oh, fuck.
[336:20.29]Really?
[336:20.59]There's nothing over here?
[336:22.28]Fuck.
[336:22.38]Come on.
[336:24.62]You fuck.
[336:37.47]That's really pretty.
[336:42.46]Invisible bridge.
[336:43.22]I'm not walking over an invisible bridge.
[336:46.59]I can't get your horse here.
[337:03.10]What?
[337:11.14]Invisible bridge crew.
[337:12.67]There they are.
[337:13.93]There they are!
[337:14.79]They've made themselves known.
[337:17.55]There's invisible bridge crew.
[337:23.13]Stop burping.
[337:32.62]Divine Tower of Limgrave.
[337:34.34]How do I open it?
[337:36.44]Like that.
[337:45.78]Right in the center.
[337:50.95]Very nice.
[337:53.79]Wait, I didn't read whatever that was!
[337:55.49]I bet you can't... I bet you can't not talk for one minute.
[338:07.70]Try me.
[338:08.10]Ready?
[338:09.22]Three, two, one, begin.
[338:40.14]Thanks for watching!
[339:20.99]I won.
[339:29.47]I won.
[339:29.91]That's my prize.
[339:31.58]Alright, for five minutes now.
[339:38.80]I've already done this.
[339:39.94]Alright.
[339:40.92]I'll do it for five minutes.
[339:41.86]I'm going to wait until the clock strikes 5.41.
[339:46.88]Five hours and 41 minutes and I'll start.
[339:52.90]You already did this in... Yeah, I know.
[339:54.36]That's what I'm saying.
[339:54.96]We already did this.
[340:00.00]Be quiet for the rest of the entire stream.
[340:04.46]What?
[340:05.66]You want to all just leave?
[340:06.63]Everybody would leave.
[340:08.57]There'd be nobody here.
[340:18.61]Oh, it's a finger.
[340:21.06]It's a dead Two Fingers.
[340:25.90]Restore the power of the Great Rune.
[340:32.74]Godrick's Great Rune.
[340:39.79]What does that do?
[340:46.29]Raises all attributes?
[340:51.49]Excuse me, what are you talking about?
[340:53.01]Raises all attributes.
[341:01.75]How do I use this?
[341:04.95]You equip this at the bonfire.
[341:09.20]Oh, shit.
[341:13.72]Okay.
[341:14.66]Hell yeah.
[341:20.86]I think that's everything I can do here, right?
[341:24.99]That's one thing done.
[341:25.87]Let's go do it.
[341:27.85]Is there any detriment to doing it?
[341:35.18]Does that do anything?
[341:37.46]Is there like a... You just do it.
[341:41.93]Great Runes.
[341:42.63]With the Great Rune menu, you can equip Great Runes that have had their power restored.
[341:49.33]You can use a Rune Arc to give even greater benefits to your equipped Great Runes.
[341:57.30]Raises all attributes.
[342:01.72]By how much?
[342:08.79]Did it do anything?
[342:12.11]I have to use a rune arc?
[342:13.23]It's... I have to use a rune arc.
[342:17.23]Um... It doesn't... It doesn't do... Oh... I get it.
[342:30.24]So you equip it.
[342:31.32]You take a rune arc.
[342:35.39]And that gives you... Oh, okay.
[342:37.13]And then when you die...
[342:39.98]It's gone, right?
[342:42.90]It's a humanity.
[342:48.01]Okay, well I have no idea when the hell I'm going to use that.
[342:49.73]Anything else to do in here?
[342:58.07]Receive power from remembrance.
[343:02.59]I don't have anything.
[343:05.53]Purchase.
[343:07.87]Queen's robe.
[343:12.23]What does this do?
[343:20.05]Do I get any benefit for wearing any of this stuff?
[343:22.09]Or is it just fashion sold?
[343:26.40]There's new intelligence stuff, right?
[343:31.36]The hat gives intelligence.
[343:32.88]Feel her look.
[343:38.83]But after the Elton Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.
[343:46.30]A grim punishment for shattering the Order.
[343:53.78]I'm sorry, maybe at some point you gotta shave it all off.
[343:59.52]It just doesn't look good.
[344:02.66]At some point you just gotta get rid of it all.
[344:39.11]Stop looking at it.
[344:42.13]So.
[344:43.93]I have like eight, so I'm like.
[344:45.35]You have anything new?
[344:49.13]No, I got everything I need from you.
[344:53.87]Thanks for the weapon, by the way.
[344:56.61]Not my ass.
[345:01.24]Alright.
[345:02.04]It's time to do step two.
[345:05.54]Step two is to go give this guy the key.
[345:10.62]Step 3.
[345:12.10]Get the boys to plus 10.
[345:20.49]Did you eat without drinking?
[345:21.33]No, I got a drink right here.
[345:33.45]I really do wonder what this does.
[345:34.77]I thought that was going to kill me.
[345:42.96]Look what I got.
[345:44.00]I've got something special for you.
[345:45.50]Give academy key.
[345:47.08]Yes, I am.
[345:47.76]For your soul.
[345:49.64]Oh.
[346:12.76]It's kind of a Sims cry.
[346:16.40]Okay, so what?
[346:17.80]For the academy.
[346:22.25]He's there now.
[346:22.95]I already bought everything he has.
[346:47.58]Oh.
[346:49.02]Okay.
[346:52.32]So should I go back to the... Where is he?
[346:56.64]Now go find him in the academy?
[346:58.26]Dude, this is gonna take fucking forever.
[347:01.78]Where would he be?
[347:07.43]Grand Library?
[347:08.13]He's gonna die in there!
[347:11.35]He's literally gonna die!
[347:17.01]Does he know that everyone's gone mad and he's gonna die?
[347:37.00]Um... Outside the classroom?
[347:43.68]This dude, okay, this dude's definitely gonna be li- Okay, here we go.
[347:46.76]Here's my prediction.
[347:48.18]We're gonna go to the classroom, and he's gonna be lying face down with an item on his back.
[347:53.23]Dead.
[347:55.53]That's what's gonna happen.
[348:00.21]He's just gonna be lying on the ground.
[348:19.26]Okay, where are you at?
[348:21.98]Is he out here?
[348:22.56]I told you he was dead!
[348:28.40]I told you he was gonna be dead!
[348:31.10]He's just sitting here, he didn't- Thop's bell bearing?
[348:35.88]An academy glintstone Thop's barrier?
[348:40.82]He's just dead!
[348:41.70]What killed him?
[348:45.58]This doesn't look like it was a murder.
[348:47.88]This looks like he kind of just died in the chair.
[348:51.86]And by the way, how did you do all this out here?
[348:56.24]How did he get in there to get all this equipment?
[349:02.52]It's like cold out here.
[349:04.52]He just got here.
[349:08.96]He just got here.
[349:10.24]We said goodbye.
[349:11.16]He teleported here.
[349:12.74]He sat in the chair and just fucking died.
[349:17.31]Alright, what was all that stuff?
[349:21.17]Academy staff, which I already had.
[349:23.66]Pops blessing or something, whatever the hell that was.
[349:27.90]What was that?
[349:28.72]Copes?
[349:32.88]What was it called?
[349:33.46]Copes bell bearing.
[349:38.19]Offer to twin maiden husks for new item access.
[349:45.50]Okay.
[349:47.01]And then... Thop's Shield?
[349:50.85]Thop's Barrier.
[349:56.17]A lifelong pursuit of Thop's the Bluntstone.
[349:59.19]Creates a magic force field that deflects sorceries and incantations.
[350:02.76]Hold to continuously create barriers.
[350:07.28]Interesting.
[350:07.78]Huh.
[350:10.18]So it's like an anti-magic shield.
[350:14.50]Okay.
[350:17.39]I'm willing to try it.
[350:18.27]Well, thanks a lot.
[350:26.02]It was another place I needed to go.
[350:27.06]There it is.
[350:28.86]Alright.
[350:29.96]Ladies and gentlemen.
[350:33.06]Ladies and gentlemen.
[350:34.42]We are now going to progress up through Northern Lunaria Lake.
[350:40.00]Up this way.
[350:40.46]We're going to go into this abandoned room.
[350:44.46]Right now.
[350:48.29]But not yet.
[350:52.41]Not yet.
[350:52.75]This is some unfinished business that needs to be taken care of.
[351:02.41]Are you high?
[351:04.39]Stop fucking blowing my spot up, dude.
[351:06.01]Come on.
[351:15.20]Okay, so first of all, I need to see if I can upgrade this weapon.
[351:17.74]Because it's been a while.
[351:29.73]Zomber Smithing Stone 5.
[351:34.38]Although I can do this.
[351:38.92]This has to replace this, right?
[351:40.90]But I need 52 intelligence.
[351:50.70]Alright.
[352:11.90]It's plus one.
[352:14.48]Okay, Oleg.
[352:15.58]I can just get Oleg up and get him ready.
[352:28.10]Who else should I do this to?
[352:29.16]Probably the dogs.
[352:30.12]The dogs have been pretty useful.
[352:32.18]Or should I save it just in case?
[352:33.33]I guess I can get everybody, right?
[352:34.67]Most of them?
[352:44.01]Never skip Oleg day.
[352:45.85]You've used the dogs once.
[352:48.75]I need Grave Glove Fort 2.
[352:50.49]Or I'll probably run into it soon.
[353:03.49]I think that's all I can do.
[353:12.70]Oh.
[353:20.45]Oh, ah!
[353:21.57]That's right.
[353:29.02]New items.
[353:45.12]I want to know what that person's problem is.
[353:49.74]Here, take this.
[353:51.34]Offer bell bearing.
[353:52.48]Offer Thops bell bearing.
[353:55.53]Bell bearing shop one?
[353:56.69]Thops, wait, one?
[354:02.15]Wait, he just puts his items here?
[354:07.79]I already bought his shit.
[354:12.14]What the fuck did that guy do for me?
[354:15.89]He gave me a little rinky-dink barrier spell.
[354:36.19]What's a memory slot?
[354:38.57]Like a memory card?
[354:42.53]Oh, it's for spells.
[354:47.35]Watch that spell be incredible.
[354:50.55]Those Who Live in Death all the more.
[354:55.79]Uh, let's see.
[355:00.05]Fuck, I haven't done this.
[355:02.16]I don't know, what do I do?
[355:03.42]Okay, I'm gonna... Does it matter?
[355:08.76]How many of these I can make?
[355:22.97]Alright, I'll make, like, the liver thing that's like, oh, you boost fire damage reduction, right?
[355:28.05]Or, like, uh, blood loss.
[355:32.36]I don't think I can put these on my weapon.
[355:33.72]I can't even use these.
[355:41.90]I can't coat this weapon with anything.
[355:44.28]It's already coated with magical power.
[355:50.74]I'll make, okay.
[355:53.56]I'm going to make... I'll make four of those.
[355:56.24]Yeah, I did it.
[355:56.80]I crafted things.
[355:58.52]Because if there's a fire boss or something, I can just take it.
[356:03.27]Buy the spell slot.
[356:07.07]Quote it with matcha powder.
[356:17.34]I sell... Okay.
[356:20.18]I'm going to sell some stuff.
[356:21.46]See if I can get to 3,000.
[356:22.48]Buy the memory slot.
[356:32.95]Alright.
[356:33.89]What's this bullshit that I don't want?
[356:46.22]I'm not going to use a greataxe, so I'm scared of it.
[356:52.06]Allum's halberd.
[356:52.84]Imagine dual welding these.
[356:54.62]That would be funny, but not me.
[356:58.90]I have...
[357:01.13]Two of these, so why do I have two of them?
[357:03.94]Okay.
[357:10.00]I am never going to use these.
[357:12.88]Ever.
[357:15.04]I'm just going to get rid of them.
[357:16.86]There's no point in keeping these.
[357:31.59]I have 99 of these?
[357:32.47]That's a thousand souls.
[357:46.20]Where did I get three brass shields from?
[358:10.18]Alright.
[358:12.80]That should get me... Okay, now I can afford... What was it?
[358:15.06]4,000?
[358:15.14]Or is it 3,000?
[358:17.22]I can have another spell.
[358:30.09]I love the blue.
[358:30.69]Yeah, it looks great.
[358:33.81]Well, not that one.
[358:34.99]This one.
[358:37.25]I want to show it off.
[358:39.34]Well, I can't.
[358:43.83]I tried to play this game, but I burnt my PC.
[358:45.70]It exploded.
[358:46.28]Uh-oh.
[358:48.14]Get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox.
[358:50.02]Alright, here it is.
[358:56.63]Increased memory slots.
[358:59.61]So now I have... Four?
[359:15.92]I'll try it.
[359:17.00]Let me try this, and let's take gravity off, and we'll try, uh, we'll try the re- Okay, I did this guy's entire quest line, and actually, I want to move these around.
[359:27.74]I want the two damage weapons to be here.
[359:44.99]Because I want this to be this.
[359:50.00]This to be this.
[359:51.76]Okay.
[359:52.60]I'll try it.
[359:57.36]Bedtime?
[359:58.00]It is not my bedtime.
[360:03.64]It is time to go.
[360:05.36]Nothing else to clean up.
[360:06.84]I'm ready.
[360:23.04]I'm making noises?
[360:23.90]I can't help it.
[360:27.92]I- people think that I just do this because I'm on stream.
[360:30.45]This is- I just do this in like the bathtub.
[360:32.83]I'll be in the bathtub just going like... I- I'm a fucking- I'm a bird.
[360:39.73]I'm like a weird parrot thing.
[360:45.01]I actually think I might have been a bird.
[360:48.15]You don't ask why birds do that shit.
[360:49.91]Because they just do.
[360:50.73]And it's not like, hey, birds, shut the fuck up.
[360:52.47]Why are you making sounds?
[360:53.29]They sing their songs and everybody loves them.
[360:58.76]When have you ever told a bird to shut the fuck up?
[361:03.90]Just being real.
[361:10.28]King's Realm Ruins.
[361:12.42]Cool.
[361:27.20]Enough of that.
[361:31.31]Not about enough of that.
[361:42.10]Ah.
[361:43.06]Eiji, forgive me.
[361:44.46]These Royal Guards grounds were placed in our trust.
[361:47.94]But we stood no chance.
[361:54.47]I just, like, farted in the bathtub.
[362:13.87]Can I be... Can I be real with everybody for a second?
[362:17.47]Who else is afraid to fart in the bathtub?
[362:23.62]Because you're afraid you're going to shit.
[362:25.90]Like you're going to shit your pants.
[362:27.20]Or shit the tub.
[362:28.00]And like shit in the tub.
[362:28.90]Because I am.
[362:34.75]Like oh I think I'm going to go ahead and just do this.
[362:37.31]Like what if you just like shit.
[362:40.87]I have had plenty of accidents in the over the years.
[362:44.38]Not in the tub.
[362:45.28]That's not going to happen.
[362:57.95]That's why I can't be on camera.
[363:00.37]No one asked this.
[363:01.49]I know.
[363:02.05]I'm sorry.
[363:02.83]What the fuck?
[363:11.61]You've been streaming for- No, no, I'm fine.
[363:13.15]Relax.
[363:16.60]What an Andy.
[363:17.60]You didn't even say what kind of Andy.
[363:18.90]What the hell?
[363:27.82]Um, there's something under here.
[363:29.24]It's probably a dungeon.
[363:49.55]So now my sorceries are stronger here.
[363:51.79]What's this?
[363:53.27]This one?
[364:05.44]Doesn't seem like a shield.
[364:08.24]It's a spell parry?
[364:18.94]Hold it.
[364:19.34]Yeah, I am.
[364:20.68]I'm holding it right now.
[364:24.98]I wonder what that... Does it hurt other people?
[364:33.45]I'll try it.
[364:38.15]But let me see if there's anything under there.
[364:41.81]There's a ruin here.
[364:50.97]It takes too fucking long.
[365:03.00]How am I supposed to parry this?
[365:13.99]Alright, congratulations.
[365:15.03]Stop.
[365:15.93]You got a fucking Glintstone key.
[365:19.19]For literally no reason.
[365:25.34]Alright, let me find out what this is.
[365:39.99]What?
[365:48.45]Looking for a way to go down in the dungeon.
[366:01.52]I saw it right here.
[366:02.16]That guy.
[366:11.94]Where is it?
[366:20.01]where is that where is that I need to find it I must find it find I if you haven't seen it either stuff
[366:56.31]What the fuck is that?
[366:57.51]Is that guy reading a book?
[367:03.62]That's huge guys up there just reading a book.
[367:07.36]Is that an NPC?
[367:21.85]What's your name?
[367:23.49]Well, look at you.
[367:28.22]We don't receive many visitors.
[367:31.20]I presume you are tarnished.
[367:35.84]What brings you here?
[367:36.80]This guy's got an anvil.
[367:47.24]Oh, pardon me.
[367:49.36]It's hardly my place to ask, is it?
[367:52.46]Though this is not a blacksmith.
[368:23.61]Oh, come on, dude.
[368:25.77]Really?
[368:26.24]I need Somber Smithing Stone five.
[368:29.32]You have up to four.
[368:31.18]You don't have five.
[368:35.85]Oh, watch out there.
[368:37.93]When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.
[368:42.57]If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.
[368:46.26]I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, tarnished.
[368:51.46]I don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work.
[368:56.70]What are you reading?
[368:58.84]Brave tarnished.
[369:01.10]A word of warning, if you please.
[369:03.72]This territory once belonged to the Carrion royal family.
[369:07.48]Their manor lies not far beyond this point.
[369:11.36]When the Raya Lucari Academy turned on the Carrions, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.
[369:18.49]After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.
[369:22.77]The Carrions were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the Knights' onslaught.
[369:30.51]by conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.
[369:35.82]That is why I say, tarnished, don't go near the manor unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless knights of the cuckoo.
[369:48.10]I have that sword.
[369:49.86]Alright, well, you've got those, but you don't have the ones I need.
[369:54.37]I've explained the peril of the enchanted snare.
[369:57.61]Enchanted snare...
[370:00.71]Stay away from that death trap.
[370:05.70]I'm not going to listen to a single word you said.
[370:07.16]And I'm going to go get killed probably two to three hundred more times.
[370:11.00]Have a good one.
[370:11.56]This is where I look over at him and he just goes...
[370:51.04]I don't know why I'm going this way but I decided to go this way.
[371:03.76]Oh, hell yeah.
[371:06.39]Oh my goodness, look at all this.
[371:07.35]Stop him.
[371:34.29]Very nice.
[371:34.69]Is there anything?
[371:37.15]Maybe the back door?
[371:42.71]Maybe there is a back door.
[371:48.62]That does not look like a back entrance.
[371:59.02]It's not a back door.
[372:02.66]Can I do anything with this big rock formation?
[372:19.23]I don't think so.
[372:23.87]Cool looking rock.
[372:26.27]Here it comes!
[372:28.03]No, it's not coming.
[372:42.51]I wanna, okay, get off the horse because I don't think I can turn well.
[372:47.33]Turning there, I probably would have fallen down.
[372:55.81]It's so fucking pretty.
[372:57.53]It's so cool looking.
[372:58.39]Alright.
[372:58.79]Alright, let's just go in the front door.
[373:00.75]Who cares?
[373:12.89]Okay.
[373:52.29]there's another lake over there alright well no no no no no no no I just check the other side no we'll go front door
[374:08.52]I missed.
[374:23.59]We made it!
[374:26.52]What?
[374:28.18]Raid?
[374:28.52]Oh, I thought somebody actually raided.
[374:38.85]Aria Manor!
[374:42.75]That's terrifying.
[374:43.55]Is that a hand?
[374:50.68]Is that a fuckin'... a fuckin'... It is a hand.
[375:10.29]Alright, the pinky fingers are the one that can't do anything.
[375:42.62]Somber Smithing Stone 2.
[375:43.92]I need a 5.
[375:45.67]Please.
[375:46.05]I don't like that either.
[375:51.33]It's disgusting.
[376:01.90]We'll check over here first.
[376:35.55]Linstone Craftsman's Cookbook.
[376:47.97]Okay, magic grease.
[376:50.21]Raw string magic grease.
[376:51.29]I just don't think I can use any of it.
[376:59.05]That was heartless.
[376:59.93]Was it though?
[377:15.66]I have that too.
[377:16.32]I just can't use it.
[377:24.65]What the fuck is that?
[377:25.61]What's going on?
[377:31.23]Oh, they're like booby traps.
[377:33.73]Okay.
[377:37.37]Spinting stone three.
[377:39.33]No fives.
[377:43.13]Hmm.
[377:58.29]Combine a two and a three?
[377:59.31]There's other little hands.
[378:27.23]Oops!

[378:45.88]Oh, shit.

[379:01.01]You can't be kidding me.
[379:12.61]Dude, I'm stuck in the fucking... I can't get out of here!
[379:17.50]What was I stuck on?
[379:18.50]What was on me?
[379:19.20]What was in the way?
[379:47.81]I'm just gonna quick run out of this shit.
[380:13.34]That is way too slow.
[380:15.12]Way too slow.
[380:26.29]Holy fucking shit, man.

[381:18.17]I was looking around for him!
[381:20.29]I actually was looking for him and I couldn't see him!
[381:23.19]Did he come out of the ground?
[381:24.21]Oh my god, you are the fucking worst enemy in the game.
[381:53.22]It's like so hard to tell what part of his hand is attacking you it's like it's such a weird fucking way to attack I Can't I like what I don't know which one of his fingers is gonna fucking swing at me It's like half of his hand attacks you
[382:25.66]Oh my fucking god!
[382:53.84]I'm gonna kill this guy because I'm fucking mad.

[383:30.03]Oh, I don't want to fight any more of these guys.
[383:41.95]I'm literally just walking by them.
[383:49.30]Rimmed Crystal Bud.
[384:18.30]I missed so much shit over there, but I don't care.
[385:02.06]I'm in severe concentration mode.

[386:10.84]Maybe eventually.
[386:16.11]Maybe after a little while.
[386:16.89]I want to beat the game.
[386:39.12]Okay.
[386:48.24]Examine this area.
[386:52.52]You're not fucking hands.
[386:56.17]I don't want to fight those hands anymore.
[386:57.33]They're the worst.
[386:58.57]Okay.
[387:06.87]As long as you guys don't have like fingers crawling out of your eyeballs and shit.

[388:21.26]What did he?
[388:21.82]Was his foot a centimeter away?
[388:25.24]Every time I'm a centimeter away, I get hit by that bullshit.
[388:35.27]A lot of things went wrong there.
[388:36.49]Don't fucking suck my ass.
[389:09.86]the edge I'm fucking sweating okay what about this way let's go this way first
[389:39.00]Watch out for their magic.
[390:06.02]Why are the trees moving?
[390:08.06]This tree is moving weirdly.
[390:09.56]Like it's going to lift up and it's going to be a guy's face.
[390:18.82]I was waiting for the tree to do something.
[390:26.94]I thought it was going to be... I thought it was a guy's hair.
[390:29.55]He's going to be like...
[390:35.66]And just fucking smash me.
[391:07.54]Can you do the goofy goober dance?
[391:36.59]My mistake was going there in the first place.
[391:39.47]Guess what the hell is over there?
[391:40.53]A rune arc?
[391:41.35]Who gives a shit?
[391:49.94]Yowch!
[391:50.98]Yowch!
[391:51.72]Yowch!
[391:53.12]Yowch!
[391:55.14]Huh?
[392:06.51]Oh you fucker.
[392:09.47]There's no stagger with this guy.
[392:39.69]I'm not putting up with him.
[392:43.83]Okay, so I just got punished for going over there because everybody just collapsed on me.
[392:54.59]Am I tripping over a mine or something?
[392:56.67]Am I summoning them?
[392:57.49]How is this happening?
[393:03.29]Am I spawning them?
[393:04.73]I feel like I'm spawning them.
[393:07.13]I'm spawning them!
[393:10.87]They're being spawned when I cross a certain threshold, a certain spawn area?
[393:15.14]Or do they just do it randomly always?
[393:17.36]I don't know.
[393:19.72]Interesting.
[393:21.84]Very interesting. ...
[393:34.48]I'm not going to get fooled by that.
[393:35.56]No, I'm sorry.
[393:37.74]Not after like 25 minutes here.
[393:47.75]Holy shit!
[393:50.15]Fine.
[394:00.63]Oh, that sucks absolute balls.
[394:02.59]I need to run.
[394:17.09]Relax.
[394:23.23]so so so
[394:51.43]Get that shit out of here.
[394:53.37]Guy on the right is firing.
[395:23.41]Really?
[395:23.73]Are you serious dude?
[395:25.92]Fuck you.
[395:27.84]I'm sitting there paying attention to the guy back here shooting from a hundred miles away.
[395:31.80]I have to kill him now because... Yeah, I just spawned like three people probably.
[395:41.15]Yep, I fucking knew it!
[395:51.64]fate how dare you you you oh you I don't want to fight him I'm running to the door
[396:23.76]I'm just checking for items.
[396:25.30]I'm just gonna see if there's items.
[396:33.67]I'll see you later.
[396:40.45]Thank god.
[396:45.29]Oh my goodness.
[396:46.02]That was horrible.
[396:54.55]That was so scary.
[396:55.25]It was so awful.
[396:57.79]And the hand was fu- Oh, fuck those hands.
[397:09.41]Oh, I can upgrade my flask.
[397:16.04]I have to go back to that area later.
[397:18.18]I don't want to go back to that fucking place.
[397:20.72]I don't like those hands.
[397:21.40]They're too freaky.
[397:22.18]They're freaky.
[397:23.16]Like super like freaky freaky.
[397:24.66]I don't like it.
[397:25.68]Too freaky.
[397:47.02]Way too freaky.
[398:00.21]So there's a summoning stone thing there.
[398:02.47]I wonder if there's something here.
[398:19.02]oh that was a little bit different move really that was kind of a different move
[399:05.54]Ow.
[399:25.01]Oh my fucking god, he's just like bouncing around!
[399:32.42]What is this fucking moveset?!
[399:35.62]He's like, looks like he's lagging, he has like 3000 fucking ping!
[399:40.78]He's like... God, what am I connecting to?
[400:06.18]Are the boys plus 10?
[400:07.44]We need way more materials to get the boys to plus 10 that I do not have.
[400:13.60]We need like... I got the boys to plus 1.
[400:20.28]That's as far as I could get.
[400:27.23]You will regret upgrading the boys.
[400:29.31]I probably will.
[400:30.35]Because literally the first... That's the first item that you get in the game, I think.
[400:35.55]That's like the first item.
[400:36.55]Oh shit.
[400:41.59]Headphones are going in for this one.
[400:46.78]I'll link up here.
[400:49.20]Seems safer.
[400:49.76]Let's try that again.
[401:17.98]There's always these old guys that just die in one hit.
[401:23.74]I don't think these guys even know that they're here.
[401:25.36]They're kind of just wandering around with a stick that they found on the ground.
[401:37.31]And when they go like this, stuff comes out and they just go, I guess I'll do that to people.
[401:41.41]Alright, yeah, I'm not fighting the giant knight.
[401:47.21]If I can get behind him.
[401:54.32]I'm killing them because they're attacking me.
[401:56.42]They're trying to kill me.
[401:59.26]I'm just defending myself.
[402:13.23]Jeez.
[402:19.79]I mean, that guy is just a big version of me.
[402:43.56]I don't have... I can't fight that guy right now.
[402:47.01]There's a fire up here maybe?
[402:50.31]Oh my fucking god!
[402:50.91]It's a guy with one of those things!
[402:52.93]He's got one of these things!
[402:56.73]Oh my god, a firework just went by my screen!
[403:21.99]Duck.
[404:06.16]Okay, um, I don't know if I want to go there.
[404:09.13]That looks like a new area.
[404:12.33]That is a pot down there, you're right.
[404:13.89]That's a pretty, that's a pog pot.
[404:21.13]Oh, thank god.
[404:24.32]Oh my goodness, I'm saved.
[404:27.08]Actually saved right there.
[404:29.78]Okay, now I don't feel as bad.
[404:39.10]That's a boss.
[404:41.57]Without a doubt.
[404:42.45]I have 8,000 souls.
[405:02.73]I'm not going for it.
[405:11.35]I'd rather fall down here, die, and spawn there and run over here.
[405:18.61]I'm gonna check over here first.
[405:32.34]This seems safer to me somehow.
[405:56.80]Oh shit!
[405:57.68]They all came over.
[405:58.38]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[406:01.45]They're fucking everywhere.
[406:02.69]They're everywhere.
[406:06.91]They're not gonna get out.
[406:07.67]They're not gonna be getting out of this one.
[406:24.11]Another cracked pot.
[406:27.22]Is that it?
[406:27.78]Can I go anywhere from here though?
[406:29.40]I think this is... Can I get out of here?
[406:32.76]How do I get out of here?
[406:35.90]Why would I go that way?
[406:36.82]Is there a door?
[406:47.46]Oh, shit.
[406:48.04]Alright, this is Pot Village.
[407:05.39]I don't want to go to hand town.
[407:08.51]Everything has to be a town or a village.
[407:10.03]Oh, a hand place.
[407:11.61]Pot town.
[407:12.66]Pot village.
[407:14.24]Pot world.
[407:15.20]Hand world.
[407:17.12]Hand city.
[407:23.76]I'm just trying to make sure this is safe because look at my health.
[407:26.54]Oh, that was almost not safe.
[407:42.98]What do you- what's behind you?
[407:44.28]There's something behind-
[408:27.21]You don't even think about it.
[408:33.53]All this way for... Something that might be good.
[408:40.53]All this way...
[408:44.84]God damn it, what is that?
[408:46.15]Oh shit!
[408:49.45]I'm fine!
[408:56.57]Hand!
[408:57.39]Hand!
[408:58.15]Hand!
[408:59.90]Oh, I need to teleport.
[409:00.72]How do I teleport?
[409:01.38]I gotta kill this.
[409:13.35]Hands off.
[409:21.85]Okay.
[409:23.21]Very important.
[409:24.71]Did I do this yet?
[409:27.42]I did already.
[409:28.12]Okay.
[409:30.36]I think I have enough to level up.
[409:35.04]I definitely do.
[409:35.90]That was insane.
[409:43.72]That was... My heart was just like exploding.
[409:53.76]14, 15.
[409:53.90]Okay, that's enough.
[409:57.44]That was an absolute rollercoaster.
[409:58.76]It really was.
[410:03.62]Mind is the easy one here because it gets us closer to Oleg.
[410:09.32]Or I got to start pumping intelligence.
[410:27.81]Alright, so that was that.
[410:29.43]That was that whole chain of events took us that way.
[410:31.84]So now I'm not completely uncomfortable going this way now.
[410:40.84]Which, I want to see what's in that boss room.
[410:47.10]I'm very, very, very curious.
[410:48.52]What about the new spell?
[410:56.57]Oh yeah, I'll look at it too.
[410:58.70]Good call.
[411:05.49]Oh, you know what?
[411:06.13]No.
[411:06.37]Let's go for this.
[411:08.63]Might as well.
[411:09.11]It's right here.
[411:21.66]He can't fit through this door.
[411:22.92]So, like, I can get rid of these... I can get rid of these idiots and he can't get through here.
[411:30.40]And then it'll be a one-on-one.
[411:37.05]Or I'll just fucking die.
[411:38.39]That's one way that could happen.
[411:40.01]Hey!
[411:53.84]So that would have been okay.
[411:55.39]I should have done the big sword move.
[412:04.34]Which I want to make sure it's there.
[412:05.88]Okay.
[412:07.58]The big sword works really well on those guys.
[412:09.24]And I have to get rid of the... In case that happens again.
[412:13.11]Just kill the dog.
[412:43.43]So, the dog is gone.
[412:47.11]I can pull them back here if I need to.
[412:55.80]Okay.
[412:56.38]Now, let's try this again.
[412:58.44]In fact, here.
[413:01.00]Just like, fuck you, buddy.
[413:23.80]Now.
[413:25.00]You.
[413:26.68]Come with me.
[413:33.47]Really?
[413:33.79]Get over here.
[414:01.52]Okay, now you.
[414:02.58]Boys!
[414:29.19]Where am I?
[414:31.33]Shit!
[414:34.73]Oh boy, that's not good.
[414:41.50]Oh, he just bumped into the wall!
[414:42.64]No, get him!
[414:46.16]Oh shit!
[414:50.08]Oh my god, I didn't dodge!
[415:10.81]Oh shit, where are they?
[415:21.07]Oh my god, your moves don't- I don't know how to time them!
[415:37.74]HEY!
[416:23.90]Oh man, really?
[416:25.02]No shit.
[416:30.83]Wow.
[416:31.91]It's a magic strength dex scaling weapon.
[416:36.81]What does that sound like?
[416:41.11]That sounds like somebody.
[416:45.39]I don't know who.
[416:54.87]Alright.
[416:55.18]Well, that's really cool.
[416:56.26]I don't know.
[416:56.56]How much health do I have?
[416:57.44]None?
[417:10.01]I mean, there's really no point to me.
[417:11.85]I'm just supposed to go back to the bonfire, right?
[417:16.29]What's the point of me doing this?
[417:18.43]To die?
[417:18.79]Okay.
[417:31.87]Dude, Jerma, bro, heal, bro.
[417:33.41]Jerma, bro, heal, bro.
[417:36.12]I'm alright.
[417:37.66]Well, that was intense.
[417:42.02]Now we do the fun thing where I go look at the boss.
[417:45.20]And then figure out if I'm too burnt out to continue to play.
[417:48.99]I'm definitely feeling it.
[417:51.33]I'm definitely starting to feel the... Like 42 straight hours of playing this game.
[418:01.30]I'm starting to kind of burn out a little.
[418:04.08]Matcha burnout.
[418:05.01]Yeah, I'm getting some matcha burnout here.
[418:14.63]42 straight hours.
[418:15.63]I know that.
[418:16.07]I'm kidding.
[418:18.03]How long has it been?
[418:20.50]37?
[418:20.52]35?
[418:20.54]38 hours straight.
[418:22.26]Essentially.
[418:25.00]Sleeping in between.
[418:26.64]And like morning errands.
[418:29.26]You know, going to the bathroom.
[418:31.68]Okay, what's going on here?
[418:32.40]What is this?
[418:35.15]Royal Knight Loretta.
[418:36.43]Do I get a horse too?
[418:38.71]Where's my horse?
[418:56.97]Where's my horse?
[419:08.46]Ow!
[419:09.92]Ooh!
[419:34.74]That was a new move.
[419:39.20]That was a one, two... Thankfully it's right here.
[419:57.67]I wonder if you stay on his right side.
[420:17.24]Ooh, okay.
[420:18.32]That's a little... That's a little snipe.
[420:19.96]Alright.
[420:26.27]Yeah.
[420:26.51]I got to stay on this other side.
[420:46.29]Yeah, that's a pain in the ass if he can't swing this way.
[421:25.64]OH, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!
[421:26.76]Ugh, I have the gravestone behind me.
[421:45.15]I really, really, really need to go find a flask upgrade.
[421:52.43]I think I might have to do some flask upgrade after this.
[422:07.06]Okay, dude, what?
[422:08.30]Fucking do something else.
[422:19.48]Piece of shit.
[422:22.16]He's not that bad.
[422:23.20]I'll get him.
[422:25.16]Unless it's like a phase two, which who knows.
[422:26.72]Alright, so he spins... He spins it around before he swings it.
[422:42.87]When he does that.
[422:43.81]You're close enough.
[422:52.32]I thought he was going to do another move.
[423:25.31]Dude, like, let me just, let me get a hit in.
[423:26.67]That, that's bad.
[423:50.87]Like, there's not very much opening.
[424:02.33]I-I even waited, too.
[424:12.24]Just spin.
[424:15.20]Okay, I spin.
[424:41.88]this is new
[424:53.24]I don't know what that is.
[424:55.24]Oh, that's no two.
[424:56.78]Okay.
[424:57.92]Uh... He forgot he has magic?
[425:04.81]Casting a spell at this boss is pretty much... I'm guaranteed to die.
[425:11.81]Takes too long.
[425:14.27]And this guy's magic.
[425:15.49]He's definitely... He's gonna be immune to magic.
[425:24.90]I could do the boys, let's see.
[425:25.82]I can't put a lock onto him.
[426:11.55]Nice job, boys!
[426:12.31]Excellent work!
[426:14.67]And that is stamina.
[426:16.63]Or I don't know what the fuck happened.
[426:17.93]I just like got caught up with all the loud sounds and all the... I don't even know what happened.
[426:25.82]I just like all the sounds.
[426:27.24]There's so much fucking sounds.
[426:29.80]I just heard like a... I just heard like screams and slashes and like I just like I'm just gonna be a part of it.
[426:35.61]I'm gonna get up there and I'm gonna slash him too.
[427:10.08]Come on boys, get him!
[427:26.46]I fucking thought I got under the horse.
[427:27.70]I thought I got under the horse but I didn't.
[427:50.64]Oh, come on.
[428:13.32]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[428:14.46]How do I get away from this?
[428:15.40]Just dodge it?
[428:29.67]Fuck!
[428:30.03]Jump, baby!
[428:30.65]Jump!
[428:31.95]I don't... I don't know.
[428:33.55]Jump over it?
[428:37.51]I dodged that pretty... I thought that was a pretty good dodge.
[428:41.57]Maybe jump?
[428:43.81]Dodge forward?
[428:46.23]Dodge into it?
[428:47.13]It won't hit me, right?
[428:56.84]Dodge forward might work, but it's an explosion.
[429:00.85]Isn't dodging forward the same distance as dodging to the right or left?
[429:05.18]Oh, fuck.
[429:05.60]I'm in trouble.
[429:06.04]I didn't throw anything up.
[429:06.80]This is a wash.
[429:10.98]Yeah, just kill me.
[429:13.62]Kill me.
[429:13.90]Kill me.
[429:17.18]I didn't have the boys ready.
[429:21.80]What about the top shield?
[429:23.66]I feel like that's so hard to use because it's like... One!
[429:29.23]You've got to time that perfectly.
[429:39.98]I don't think I need it.
[429:40.56]I think as long as I could reliably get away from the... Whatever it is.
[429:44.72]Do I have the thop step?
[429:47.22]I already found the thop step.
[429:48.56]It was just the academy step.
[429:52.00]Uh, I... Oh god, again.
[429:53.38]Whatever.
[429:55.75]Yeah, kill me again.
[430:08.53]I keep forgetting to summon them when I get in.
[430:13.86]I also might have to stop streaming.
[430:17.39]My eyes, I can feel my eyes starting to pulse.
[430:21.01]It's probably time to stop.
[430:28.71]I thought I was going to be able to go longer today.
[430:30.71]I don't think so.
[430:31.39]He didn't even swing at me.
[430:46.97]Let's go.
[431:20.54]Really?
[431:29.46]Eat shit.
[431:31.52]Three attacks.
[432:00.91]That was kind of bullshit.
[432:13.24]Alright, here we go.
[432:14.46]Dodge through it.
[432:24.98]Yup.
[432:42.79]Thank you.
[433:44.04]Let's go on a good one!
[433:45.32]Go on a good one!
[434:00.65]Oh man, that was hard.
[434:07.18]Magical bow?
[434:13.00]Yeah, that wasn't too bad.
[434:13.84]He was just trying to figure out how to get away from the projectiles.
[434:17.84]Because once you understand that, like... It's hard to determine if he's going to swing more than two or three times.
[434:25.15]But just let him do it, right?
[434:29.65]When you're next to him and he's like, swing!
[434:32.51]Swing!
[434:33.93]Don't attack.
[434:35.33]Sometimes he does it twice.
[434:36.19]Sometimes he does it three times.
[434:37.25]Sometimes he does it four times.
[434:39.35]Just dodge it.
[434:40.63]Just dodge.
[434:41.55]And then when he stops, take a swing.
[434:46.71]That was on 10,000 souls?
[434:48.45]Really?
[434:48.77]That's it?
[434:55.69]Only 10k?
[434:58.97]That's kind of horseshit.
[435:09.04]Okay.
[435:13.62]Do you have a... Let me see those spells.
[435:19.54]Oh, these are crystals.
[435:26.73]That's probably so cool, though.
[435:27.89]Let me see.
[435:40.07]Imagine hitting somebody with this.
[435:43.12]Imagine shooting that.
[435:44.10]That's no way you're gonna hit anybody with that.
[435:45.44]Not a chance.
[435:49.78]I mean, maybe you'll hit... I mean, that looks awesome.
[435:55.60]Alright, I gotta call it.
[435:57.95]I can't go anymore.
[436:00.05]I thought I was gonna be able to go for, like, at least another hour or two.
[436:03.05]No, no way.
[436:04.37]You can probably tell my, like, energy, like, an hour ago.
[436:08.19]I went from, like, a 7, 8, and a 10 in energy to, like, a 3.
[436:11.18]Or, like, a 4, like, 45 minutes ago.
[436:16.32]I'll go back through.
[436:16.98]I'm not gonna be streaming tomorrow.
[436:19.48]The next time, I will be live.
[436:22.86]Let's do... This today.
[436:31.70]Okay.
[436:33.84]I will see you guys for more Elden Ring.
[436:40.92]On Wednesday.
[436:42.10]I'll take a couple days.
[436:46.41]I'll refresh.
[436:49.09]And we will go Wednesday.
[436:50.61]Probably Wednesday, Thursday.
[436:51.53]Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[436:55.42]Because I'm into it.
[436:56.20]I don't want to take too long of a break.
[436:58.26]Maybe like a day or two.
[436:58.96]Because I really don't want to lose the muscle memory.
[437:02.94]Because if you don't play for like a week and you come back, you're like a wet sock.
[437:09.41]You're like a dirty wet sock and it doesn't work.
[437:12.09]You'll forget how to play.
[437:12.91]Yeah, it's true.
[437:15.07]Wednesday at... Yeah, Wednesday at 4.
[437:18.16]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[437:21.22]Thanks for hanging out.
[437:22.00]Thanks for watching the streams.
[437:23.40]I think we're making pretty good progress.
[437:27.18]I mean, I talked a lot of shit about this area.
[437:29.12]But, you know, I literally talked shit about the entire game the entire time I'm playing.
[437:36.80]I'll see you Wednesday.
[437:37.42]Thanks for watching.
[437:38.02]We'll hang out for a minute.
[437:41.42]Uh, that's saved there.
[437:47.24]Best boss in the game is coming up.
[437:48.54]Ooh.
[437:49.27]Well, I'm excited for Wednesday.
[437:54.19]Thanks for staying up too, I know this launch has been kind of crazy.
[437:59.73]All these, uh... All these streams going into like 3 o'clock in the morning Eastern, 4 o'clock in the morning Eastern pretty much.
[438:06.38]That will probably change a little once, you know, maybe this next week rolls around.
[438:12.36]But I am fucking tired.
[438:18.92]It's so funny because, like, okay, after the pot almost killed me twice, my soul left my body even more than it already was.
[438:27.01]I'm actually not, I'm not even, I'm surprised I actually could beat this guy.
[438:29.93]People were asking me, like, questions, and I was like, I can't do that.
[438:34.81]I think I just shut my brain off and fought him.
[438:36.29]Uh-oh, matcha tea immunity building up.
[438:44.67]Well, that's just been four days.
[438:51.95]Empty head.
[438:58.71]Implying that you're going to beat it, PepeLav.
[439:01.28]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[439:03.52]I beat Sekiro on stream.
[439:05.20]If I can do Sekiro, which I think Sekiro was harder than this game.
[439:09.04]So far.
[439:16.02]This is much longer than Sekiro, but I think the difficulty in playing Sekiro is harder than this.
[439:23.58]They're harder in different ways, but this one... This is like the harder... I don't know where I would put this in difficulty.
[439:31.66]I really don't know.
[439:34.12]I think Sekiro is much more difficult because the game is played a lot differently.
[439:38.76]And it was really hard to get used to the fact that you had to just sit there and L1 every single enemy in the game.
[439:45.77]You couldn't, like, dodge around.
[439:47.25]You couldn't... There was no sorcery.
[439:49.39]There was no dodge mechanic that was... You know, that's... You died.
[439:53.67]You could dodge, but it wasn't even close to... You needed to parry.
[439:57.17]You had to parry almost every single attack.
[440:02.27]But I think this is probably the hardest of the Dark Souls-like games.
[440:08.65]That's tough, though, because I do remember...
[440:12.49]I remember a few encounters in Dark Souls 3 being, like, unbearable.
[440:18.60]I'm trying to think of, like, comparing some hardbots.
[440:20.48]It's been so long since I played Dark Souls 3.
[440:24.08]Like, Pontiff, maybe?
[440:25.20]I remember struggling with Pontiff and being like, holy shit, this guy's, like, not completable.
[440:34.41]I haven't really, okay, I haven't really thought that way yet.
[440:39.65]about any... Pontiff was easy.
[440:44.35]Pontiff was easy if you could parry.
[440:45.87]Because you could parry him, right?
[440:48.83]It was the... When he summoned the second clone of himself, it just was so... My brain was so hard to dodge and get around the clone.
[440:57.42]DLC dragon?
[440:58.38]Yeah.
[440:58.92]Okay.
[440:59.34]There it is.
[441:01.94]Yeah.
[441:02.08]Some of the DLC in Dark Souls 3 was unbelievably difficult.
[441:04.90]I remember I actually had to summon people for that shit.
[441:12.34]I remember summoning people for that dragon.
[441:15.20]Yeah, Medeir.
[441:15.78]Medeir, it was unbearable.
[441:17.48]Nameless King was pretty bad too.
[441:19.60]But I feel like Nameless King was not as... Medeir just had so much health.
[441:25.46]The fight just dragged on so long that you got kind of like exhausted halfway through it.
[441:31.56]Oh no, I never beat Medeir.
[441:32.38]I remember summoning four people and we couldn't do it.
[441:39.34]Alright, I'm taking a break from streaming for a day and a half, two days.
[441:45.86]Thanks again, everybody.
[441:47.78]I'll see you soon.
[441:48.32]I believe there's a big boss coming up here.
[441:54.56]We'll find out.
[441:58.20]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[442:00.52]Take care of yourselves.
[442:02.34]I'm gonna go take a shower.
[442:06.76]And I'll see you guys Wednesday at 4 o'clock.
[442:09.53]Good night.
[442:10.35]Goodbye.
[442:10.69]Take care of yourselves.
[442:12.57]Have a great night.
[443:01.28]Thank you.
