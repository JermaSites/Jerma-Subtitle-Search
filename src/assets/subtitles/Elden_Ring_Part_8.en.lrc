[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.47]I am back.
[00:06.23]How are you?
[00:08.49]I missed it by one minute.
[00:12.83]One minute.
[00:15.09]I'm here.
[00:16.85]Make an Elden Ring open and ready.
[00:18.81]Alright, that was nice.
[00:25.97]I had some food.
[00:32.36]Add a little bit more water.
[00:34.26]Played with Otto.
[00:34.98]Hung out with Holly for a little bit.
[00:39.24]Let me just Ster my drink.
[00:43.68]Because I can't close it because I have too much ice in it.
[00:51.49]Just say what you did.
[00:52.35]I didn't do the thing you're describing.
[00:56.27]But, you know.
[01:00.13]I do need to plug this in.
[01:04.48]I don't know what happened to my GoXLR, but the audio Jack where you plug in a pair of headphones is broken.
[01:10.16]I didn't really do anything.
[01:11.34]I don't know what happened to it.
[01:15.57]I don't get it.
[01:21.89]Okay, Elden Ring.
[01:24.47]Let's open it.
[01:29.91]You guys cannot see anything, can you?
[01:31.86]No, you cannot yet.
[01:35.96]What's in my pocket?
[01:39.23]Alright.
[01:40.89]So, I gotta remember what the hell I was doing, because it's been a few days.
[01:43.73]I think I want to go north-east.
[01:50.26]I believe that's where I'm heading.
[01:51.82]I gotta change the category.
[02:04.53]We're in Elden Ring now, not Big Brain Academy.
[02:13.36]Alright.
[02:19.04]Put a heart rate monitor on?
[02:21.32]I don't have access to a heart rate monitor at the moment.
[02:23.65]I'm sorry.
[02:24.13]Dude, you should put a heart rate monitor on.
[02:30.81]I...
[02:35.11]Maybe another time?
[02:36.33]Very cool.
[02:39.55]I need to change that.
[02:58.42]Oh, why is it getting louder?
[03:06.16]Here we go.
[03:10.06]I am fresh.
[03:10.80]I have returned.
[03:12.66]I know the audio is not in sync.
[03:14.10]Give me one second while I fix it.
[03:15.36]Okay.
[03:27.03]Be good.
[03:30.43]There we go.
[03:30.85]There.
[03:34.94]Hi.
[03:44.25]Let's go.
[03:46.81]Elden Ring.
[03:52.53]This motherfucker looks like he drinks aloe vera juice.
[03:55.51]Well, I can assure you I don't.
[03:58.88]I don't drink aloe vera juice.
[04:06.20]Why?
[04:07.34]Whatever.
[04:09.42]Okay.
[04:11.50]So.
[04:14.83]I came over here because it was a few things I didn't do this way.
[04:23.04]If you're wondering the character, yeah, baby rattle.
[04:27.76]I'll give you just some people that are jumping in that are like, whoa, what's your gear, bro?
[04:31.68]What's your loadout, bro?
[04:34.20]Imp cat head, Godskin Noble robe, Godskin Apostle bracers, Godskin trousers.
[04:42.82]Plus 9 Bastard Stars and a plus 4 Glintstone as your Glintstone staff.
[04:48.91]Did you bring your notes?
[04:49.69]I did.
[04:51.11]I did bring my notes.
[04:54.45]I don't know why they're not showing.
[04:56.73]I did bring them.
[05:00.49]There.
[05:02.51]Alright, door next to spawn is blocked shut.
[05:04.45]Who cares?
[05:05.13]Looking for Lanya.
[05:06.21]Haven't found them yet.
[05:07.85]That Prawn guy says piss off.
[05:10.59]I don't know what to do with that person.
[05:13.74]The... I did the elevator, didn't I?
[05:17.12]Is the offer elevator?
[05:18.06]I think I did that already.
[05:21.19]Didn't I put it in?
[05:27.69]I got this.
[05:28.49]I remember getting the complete coin.
[05:31.39]I think I did that.
[05:32.97]I did.
[05:34.69]So we don't have very much here as of right now.
[05:40.19]But let's go.
[05:45.43]Oh, kill the prawn guy.
[05:49.27]I want to go over here.
[05:58.20]There's this Erdtree that I have not done.
[06:00.14]There's a bunch of random shit over here.
[06:03.88]Like that.
[06:07.10]Like this.
[06:08.60]Like that.
[06:10.91]So we're going to make our way this way.
[06:14.41]Why do we still look like this?
[06:16.69]Oh, we still look like this because something's wrong with my audio.
[06:19.10]Let me get this situated for a second.
[06:30.75]Only coming through one ear.
[06:31.57]That's better.
[06:35.25]Okay.
[06:36.67]I can hear.
[06:37.17]Alright, let's go to five first.
[06:43.21]Yeah, we're still doing like the cat baby thing.
[06:49.13]So this is area I've not been in.
[06:50.37]I think this is a church, right?
[06:59.48]Okay, this trebuchet is launching.
[07:17.99]Please Thank you That was a bird okay, I saw a shadow of a bird and I freaked out I don't think they can launch over here Shouldn't mean anything Why do you have a toddler on a horse?
[07:47.06]See the last Vaude.
[07:48.40]It's hard to explain.
[07:49.22]Hey, I learned this from Reddit.
[08:03.78]Are you behind me?
[08:04.40]Holy shit, you're behind me.
[08:10.22]That didn't hit him?
[08:10.86]Oh boy, this is bad.
[08:16.51]Christ.
[08:23.63]Oh my God, what's happening?
[08:26.99]What have I done?
[08:27.93]No!
[08:51.87]Don't block that shit.
[09:00.85]Where is it?
[09:01.75]I'm trying to get it to kill him.
[09:08.86]Sucker.
[09:11.04]Sucker!
[09:18.76]That was killing me.
[09:39.46]That hits I didn't know that hit that many times in a row I gotta kill the guy behind that Die
[10:04.14]What area is this?
[10:05.26]This area is... Hold on.
[10:08.14]I can't really stop.
[10:08.64]Give me one sec.
[10:12.98]Damn.
[10:14.52]This weapon's actually really, really good.
[10:16.44]We talked a lot of shit.
[10:19.36]Okay, this area... Is this sort of northern... Lernia?
[10:27.89]Is this church right here?
[10:30.41]Is this, uh, Everjail?
[10:32.01]I know how to say it correct now.
[10:33.45]I don't want to go this way, though.
[10:35.55]I want to go to my marker over here.
[10:40.59]Popium.
[10:44.84]So many fucking markers.
[10:45.68]Alright, we'll get rid of this guy.
[10:54.78]I'm actually destroying people in this zone.
[11:10.23]I'm annihilating people in this zone.
[11:11.87]I must be high for this place.
[11:14.87]I must be very leveled for this area.
[11:18.24]At least this exact spot here.
[11:23.50]Yeah, I definitely am.
[11:25.92]Did you avoid most spoilers?
[11:28.19]Great, Mace.
[11:29.87]Um, yes.
[11:33.14]The only thing that was ever spoiled for me was the witch quest.
[11:37.02]Because I had it on a second monitor over here.
[11:41.60]And I've- I apologized for that.
[11:43.86]I already apologized for it.
[11:46.70]So, we're not doing- I got no more guides.
[11:54.82]Okay.
[11:56.05]Up there.
[11:57.33]Can I even get up there?
[11:58.43]That seems far away.
[12:04.48]There might be a dungeon over here, too.
[12:05.58]Ooh, cookie bug.
[12:12.76]Nothing?
[12:15.50]He definitely smoked on that 20 minute break.
[12:19.20]No, I can't.
[12:20.75]I can't.
[12:22.91]I got way too much shit to do over the next, like, two or three straight days.
[12:26.07]I can't, like, I can't get, like, no.
[12:29.05]That's not happening.
[12:30.25]Not right now.
[12:41.96]Dungeon?
[12:46.20]Why are they here?
[13:00.02]How have I not come up to this kind of northern Lurnia?
[13:02.44]Where have I been this whole time?
[13:05.87]Doing the witch quest, right?
[13:07.69]That took almost a whole stream.
[13:11.17]Yellow ember.
[13:13.70]Nothing over here, though.
[13:21.22]Alright, there we go.
[13:25.00]I'm watching you.
[13:25.80]Hey.
[13:29.36]How are you?
[13:29.88]What's that sound?
[13:36.31]What's going on?
[13:36.83]What's wrong? What's wrong?
[13:45.38]What was that?
[13:45.80]I need a bonfire.
[14:02.33]It's the Bloodborne shit.
[14:06.91]That's Bloodborne shit.
[14:08.09]That's the... what were they called?
[14:09.87]They were called like the Winter Lanterns?
[14:12.05]And they'd walk around and if you saw them, it would fill and you went... if you died?
[14:20.38]Okay.
[14:21.56]Is it just a line of sight thing?
[14:27.72]If it's a line of sight thing, I may be alright.
[14:32.47]Is it line of sight?
[14:33.05]Okay, it's character line of sight.
[14:39.68]Jesus.
[14:52.20]I can't see it.
[14:52.69]Alright, let me get up there and kill whoever's doing that.
[15:15.19]What the fuck?
[15:20.29]Is that a machine?
[15:21.09]Oh!
[15:24.43]Fuck you!
[15:31.29]Alright.
[15:43.02]Cool.
[15:45.91]It's not going to affect me when I'm right here, right?
[15:57.58]5G.
[16:05.50]Owl of Shabriri.
[16:10.95]Is that a spell?
[16:15.73]Shrieks building up madness in nearby foes.
[16:18.55]33 faith.
[16:21.09]At least it's a maddening shriek that causes madness buildup in foes nearby.
[16:28.87]And it's a taunt.
[16:30.96]That's kind of cool.
[16:34.74]So what happens if I go up here?
[16:40.50]What's the... Am I going to get madnessed?
[16:51.63]Your person is so ugly.
[16:56.45]No, don't say that.
[16:59.75]Why am I still getting it?
[17:00.65]Alleviates build up of frost.
[17:07.76]Alleviates build up of sleep.
[17:11.02]Scarlet rot, blood loss, frost, sleep.
[17:14.68]I don't have any madness ones, do I?
[17:24.77]Light?
[17:26.19]Sleep?
[17:26.99]No.
[17:27.21]Alright, here's the plan.
[17:32.85]I'm going to go up there.
[17:33.51]If I die, I die.
[17:34.35]I'm going to start the process right now.
[17:36.72]Go.
[17:43.17]What the fuck is it?
[17:43.81]What is it?
[17:44.17]What is it?
[17:44.61]What is it?
[17:55.61]What?
[17:58.38]Throw a grenade up there.
[18:14.67]I did?
[18:19.26]That's it?
[18:19.60]Alright, I did it.
[18:25.76]So that means I can walk around here without a problem.
[18:29.52]It was just them doing that.
[18:30.70]Okay, well that's weird.
[18:31.48]No chest or anything.
[18:37.28]But that means I can walk around here without hiding.
[18:43.36]Alright, the actual place I want to go is 5.
[18:45.74]I got the chest?
[18:49.63]Yeah, that's right.
[18:50.19]You're right.
[18:50.83]I got it.
[18:55.05]That just lets you... Hopefully it doesn't respawn.
[18:59.31]Up there.
[18:59.67]I think there's ruins here too.
[19:04.72]Remember, you look like a renaissance painting.
[19:15.33]Now I do.
[19:25.88]Frenzied Flame Village.
[19:27.08]There's going to be another one of those things here and there.
[19:35.36]I have not found a bonfire, so I really have to be careful.
[19:40.03]Even though...
[19:42.63]Even though I might be a tad overleveled for this exact spot.
[19:47.67]Died from less.
[19:55.03]Pretty clean.
[20:04.92]Clean.
[20:07.06]What is it?
[20:16.47]Is this a mask?
[20:23.57]It's not.
[20:23.97]What was that?
[20:24.45]Is it a spell?
[20:26.95]An item?
[20:34.18]It's talisman.
[20:40.26]Constantly attracts enemy aggression.
[20:44.02]Somebody explain this to me, right?
[20:46.63]In the Souls games, they have items like this.
[20:51.11]What's the point of this item?
[20:52.27]Why would you put this on?
[20:56.13]Why would you ever want to wear this?
[20:59.52]Make co-op easier?
[21:01.42]Co-op.
[21:02.58]It's tanking and a summon.
[21:03.56]For hard mode, farming items.
[21:05.62]Co-op to tank.
[21:06.40]Okay, that makes sense.
[21:13.85]That makes sense.
[21:14.75]You're right.
[21:18.34]What else is in here?
[21:28.30]How do I hear something weird?
[21:40.73]Note, the Lord of Frenzied Flame.
[21:45.29]The boss?
[21:52.98]Okay.
[21:53.54]Beneath Lyndell, at the very bottom, lies our lord.
[21:57.38]Lord of the Frenzy.
[21:58.25]The Three Fingers who holds us in thrall.
[22:01.37]Beneath Lyndell.
[22:02.33]Where's Lyndell?
[22:08.63]Lyndell?
[22:10.03]Lyndell?
[22:10.63]Three Fingers.
[22:12.54]What happened to Two Fingers?
[22:16.68]Have I been to Lyndell?
[22:17.42]Lyndell?
[22:22.36]Put it in the notes.
[22:23.02]That's not... Yeah, that's true.
[22:24.90]What does it say?
[22:32.57]Beneath Leyndell, the very bottom.
[22:40.31]At the very bottom of Leyndell.
[22:45.30]Frenzied.
[22:47.76]Flame Lord.
[22:48.82]Okay.
[22:59.26]I don't think I've come across Lyndell yet.
[23:06.88]Is there anything else here?
[23:08.32]I feel like there would be, right?
[23:12.27]A lot of these places have little dungeons to go in, so I'm not fucking missing it.
[23:23.09]Maybe not.
[23:23.45]Maybe it's just a village.
[23:32.33]I think it's just a village.
[23:33.30]I think it's a lore village.
[23:46.18]Something keeps making...
[23:50.19]I keep hearing sounds.
[23:52.35]Like, loud sounds.
[23:53.45]I don't know if it's just the atmosphere or what.
[23:57.79]Well, I don't know.
[23:58.73]That's cool.
[24:00.25]Closer to my actual goal, which is... Nah, I'm going the wrong way.
[24:03.63]But I did want to go to the Ur-Tree.
[24:04.75]Let's go fight the Avatar here.
[24:16.36]I need a bonfire now!
[24:31.46]Really?
[24:33.39]That's too many.
[24:38.95]Challenge, though.
[24:39.45]Let's do it.
[24:43.79]Okay, never mind.
[24:45.27]Never mind.
[24:45.67]I don't want to do it anymore.
[24:46.57]I was kidding.
[24:48.62]Never mind.
[24:55.20]Nevermind.
[24:55.56]Leave.
[24:56.30]Goodbye.
[25:04.62]Stop it!
[25:27.82]I might get something for this.
[25:28.86]I don't know.
[25:41.28]Let me do my stupid fucking move!
[25:57.08]Alright.
[25:58.60]Is there any reason for me to do that?
[26:01.78]Grave Violet.
[26:02.88]Okay.
[26:03.16]That's nothing.
[26:03.82]Nobody dropped anything cool.
[26:04.82]Nobody had anything.
[26:05.52]Ooh.
[26:10.44]What's that way?
[26:11.58]Mark it.
[26:11.86]What is that?
[26:14.83]Alright.
[26:15.05]Pay attention.
[26:16.91]I need... I need a bonfire.
[26:24.26]It's gotta be one down here, right?
[26:51.27]He's gonna kill me.
[26:51.91]Oh, it's a giant- it's one of the fucking- bear.
[27:31.71]Does he care?
[27:42.27]I don't think he knows.
[27:51.88]Get off!
[28:11.12]Go!
[28:57.51]3,000 damage.
[28:59.61]Yeah, I may be a little leveled up with this guy.
[29:06.83]It's very possible that I'm a little leveled up.
[29:12.50]Although I have not seen anything in this area, so, you know.
[29:16.34]I'm not going to just not do it, right?
[29:24.78]Definitely a dungeon down here.
[29:26.56]Without a doubt.
[29:28.95]Like a million percent dungeon.
[29:30.98]A hundred million percent.
[29:58.35]Come on.
[30:04.98]Aye.
[30:05.10]How did you miss?
[30:12.67]You literally saw the entrance.
[30:13.99]I did?
[30:14.29]I did?
[30:18.95]No, I didn't.
[30:25.44]Comically large arrows.
[30:26.54]Where's the entrance?
[30:37.66]Oh, it was a liar.
[30:38.36]Okay.
[30:38.92]Oh, it was a liar.
[30:39.80]Okay.
[30:40.32]Somebody that's lying.
[30:46.53]Alright, there's somebody with a bow and arrow down there.
[30:48.09]Whatever.
[30:52.51]Where the fuck am I?
[30:53.91]Oh, alright.
[30:54.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:55.34]I'm biting off way more than I can chew.
[30:56.84]Back up to what I wanted to do.
[30:58.02]I'm getting too distracted.
[30:58.88]This is literally the distract yourself video game.
[31:02.82]You'll see something far away.
[31:04.62]You'll go, oh, I'm going to go to that thing.
[31:06.65]You'll trot like 15 feet in front of you and go, what's that?
[31:09.53]And turn left and you're lost.
[31:11.97]And then you do something else for like four hours.
[31:15.27]So focus on the task that is at hand right now.
[31:19.78]Go to the Urd tree.
[31:31.39]Which I need to get up.
[31:36.64]Can I get up from here?
[31:43.72]Who's that?
[31:44.16]Who the fuck is this guy?
[31:48.63]Why do you look so special?
[31:49.67]Doesn't this guy look special?
[32:02.54]He's a little special.
[32:03.62]Alright, he was a little special.
[32:26.93]Oh shit, I found a... Alright, cool.
[32:29.97]Elem Highway.
[32:36.32]Black Knife Catacombs.
[32:37.98]Somebody said this dungeon sucks.
[32:40.30]Beast eye quivers?
[32:41.45]The beast eye quivers.
[32:45.53]Beast eye quivers.
[32:46.77]Do I have a beast eye?
[33:00.85]Is that to tremble when close to death root?
[33:05.25]Oh, okay.
[33:09.33]That just means there's an undead.
[33:10.71]Okay, cool.
[33:12.23]Can't level up dead.
[33:13.02]Maybe I can.
[33:17.98]Yeah, I'm probably pretty level for this place, so I'm not scared.
[33:21.30]This does not scare me.
[33:22.12]Yeah, that's the guy that eats the, uh, that eats him, right?
[33:33.89]Although, who knows?
[33:34.55]I could be just totaled full of shit right now.
[33:36.35]I know.
[33:46.22]I could just be full of shit and I lose immediately to this guy.
[34:02.37]Ooh, there is a stone sword key thingy.
[34:09.66]Um...
[34:16.38]Why won't they die?
[34:17.76]What?
[34:22.82]I want to go in here.
[34:29.33]Do they not die?
[34:29.99]Are these like the bones people from Mario?
[34:33.19]That I've not killed?
[34:35.75]Okay.
[34:36.19]You can't kill them.
[34:39.25]Those guys don't die.
[34:52.13]Dry Bones.
[34:52.63]Yeah, that's the character I'm thinking of.
[35:00.10]Alright.
[35:00.58]I can't kill them, so I gotta get my souls.
[35:02.44]Gonna go in the stone and sword key room because I want to get in there.
[35:05.24]Alright.
[35:15.49]So what's in here?
[35:18.16]Oh, what is that thing?
[35:20.16]Gosis' axe?
[35:23.60]Alright, is there anything else in here?
[35:27.02]I need you guys to fuck off for one second.
[35:30.93]Nothing else in here.
[35:31.59]Okay, leave.
[35:40.51]Oh, that guy's bringing him to life.
[35:46.07]Okay, so you just have to kill that guy.
[35:52.46]Sounds easy enough.
[35:54.08]I want to see... Why is this guy coming back?
[35:56.20]That guy was different.
[36:00.80]I want to see the axe.
[36:03.74]This is an int scaling axe?
[36:07.84]Rosis, who shows the path to the catacombs through the lands between, is depicted on the ritual axe.
[36:16.20]Summon?
[36:20.81]Really?
[36:21.09]Whoa.
[36:30.53]That's a pretty badass move.
[36:33.62]That's pretty badass.
[36:38.40]What is it?
[36:38.76]It scales with Strength and Int.
[36:41.66]No.
[36:43.58]Only 18 Strength.
[36:46.54]Don't think I want to change it up for the baby rattle at this point in the game.
[36:51.14]Baby rattle too good.
[36:55.02]That's really cool.
[36:58.96]Alright, no more stalling.
[36:59.68]Let's go.
[37:00.52]I have to go through this bullshit.
[37:01.46]I thought I got hit by it.
[37:05.69]I was like, how the fuck is that possible?
[37:06.95]I was about to start freaking out and talking shit about FromSoftware.
[37:09.97]I was going to be like, there's no way.
[37:11.23]It's impossible for that to happen.
[37:23.76]Stop!
[37:27.35]Stop it!
[37:27.95]Alright, now I'm fucking mad at this guy.
[37:35.71]Alright, I forgot the buttons for a second.
[37:37.27]It's been like a week.
[37:49.64]Shit, these guys are connected to a sorcerer.
[37:59.51]Why fight them?
[37:59.95]There's no reason to.
[38:10.66]Okay.
[38:11.02]I can go down.
[38:13.98]Let's go down.
[38:16.77]Now you get it.
[38:27.63]The crab is like dirt crab.
[38:37.73]Are they hostile?
[38:38.35]I don't think they are.
[38:39.07]I think that I'm just unnecessary.
[38:43.11]Hmm.
[38:46.79]Hmm.
[38:56.65]Kill it before I can do anything!
[39:02.70]Rune Arc.
[39:03.16]Hooray!
[39:09.90]Really?
[39:16.35]The whole point was I didn't want you to come near me, but you did anyways.
[39:27.69]Okay.
[39:28.78]So this is obviously not correct.
[39:30.28]Obviously.
[39:37.25]Obviously.
[39:53.50]I didn't get up there.
[40:02.31]I can't kill these guys.
[40:07.27]Stop for one second!
[40:08.49]I can't even fucking look!
[40:20.21]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[40:26.13]Is that how you do it?
[40:29.27]That is how you do it.
[40:39.88]What a giga brain.
[40:41.34]I didn't look at any.
[40:41.94]Nobody in chat said that.
[40:44.02]I go back and look at the logs and literally nobody, when I looked over, like the precise moment I looked over, nobody said ride them up.
[40:50.22]Nobody did.
[40:50.74]So, like, I mean, that's, you know, well accomplished.
[40:55.15]Yeah.
[40:57.11]Alright, there's another... Get over here.
[41:09.28]Thank God.
[41:12.18]Scimitar.
[41:15.96]He did it all by himself.
[41:17.69]No guide.
[41:26.13]Don't you guys understand?
[41:27.23]The only way you can play a FromSoftware game truly by yourself is if you play within the first, like, two days the game comes out.
[41:45.82]That means offline, okay, offline, so no bloodstains, no messages, right?
[41:51.08]The person that gets there first, that puts the message down, yeah.
[41:54.38]They did it by themselves.
[42:03.64]I didn't do that by myself.
[42:06.32]See, I looked over, and somebody said invis wall.
[42:10.17]So I just deduced where the best possible scenario, the best possible place that would be.
[42:16.96]And I figured they would be here.
[42:19.48]Am I going to... I feel like I'm pretty over leveled though.
[42:24.80]But this is really far in.
[42:26.78]I have a lot of souls.
[42:31.46]I don't have any heals though.
[42:41.57]I am going to err on the side of caution.
[42:42.85]But I need to figure out... Because there was a lever I could pull.
[42:47.98]Is this gonna kill me if I go down here?
[42:52.39]Just do it and no heals.
[42:54.23]Just do it.
[42:56.03]This boss is easy.
[42:57.41]Just do it.
[42:58.21]It's easy.
[42:58.71]Coward.
[42:59.09]This boss is actually easy.
[43:00.23]Fine.
[43:03.71]Black Knife Assassin.
[43:08.17]Oh.
[43:20.77]Shit.
[43:34.95]Okay, well.
[43:36.40]If I had a fucking flask, maybe.
[43:39.36]I'm doing a shitload of damage to him.
[43:44.49]Attack him.
[43:45.39]I do... I'm walking the boss room for the first time.
[43:50.11]I'm not just gonna start pressing R1.
[43:52.39]I'm not just gonna... Alright, you know what?
[43:53.55]I guess I walked in the boss door.
[43:55.42]Let's just fucking go ahead and start doing this.
[43:57.24]I mean... I'm gonna die in one second.
[43:59.28]I don't even know what he does.
[44:00.40]Okay, how do I get back there?
[44:16.39]There's another boss here.
[44:17.45]There's a second door.
[44:21.60]You fought this guy already.
[44:22.94]Did I?
[44:23.26]I don't know.
[44:27.16]Elden Ring is like eight games in one game, so it's hard to remember what I did.
[44:37.16]Oh, shit.
[44:37.88]That's gonna hurt.
[44:57.29]Yeah, I mean, I may have fought this enemy type 36 or 38 bosses ago, but I don't, I mean, it's been a while.
[45:05.21]Give me those souls, don't hurt me.
[45:22.46]See if I can catch him in this.
[45:28.58]Ooh!
[45:29.82]Oh man, that's bad for him.
[45:45.07]Alright, don't be a fucking idiot.
[45:56.93]Okay, he's good.
[45:58.05]You're way off the level though.
[45:59.27]Dude, I'm just exploring the areas I didn't do yet.
[46:03.85]I missed every fucking swing?
[46:12.46]What?
[46:20.99]Yeah, I'm overleveled for this area, but I haven't been here yet.
[46:28.69]And I'm not just gonna run by it.
[46:38.20]That guy got more hits than the boss did.
[46:40.46]Yeah, but he was also very surprising.
[46:43.74]Okay, that's not it though.
[46:46.46]Because this is another not-hidden boss.
[46:48.78]And what was that?
[46:54.54]Two things that he dropped.
[46:55.38]What was it?
[46:59.70]Black Knifeprint.
[47:00.56]Mark of the Night of the Black Knives Ritual.
[47:06.25]On the Night of the Black Knives, someone stole a fragment of death from Milliketh, the Black Blade, and imbued his power onto the Assassin's Dagger.
[47:19.03]Okay.
[47:22.71]That's an item.
[47:23.59]There was another item.
[47:24.93]Was it one of these?
[47:25.45]It was.
[47:28.32]Critical hits restore FP.
[47:31.70]Doesn't seem that useful for this particular build.
[47:36.56]Alright, I'm going to try this.
[47:37.68]Let's see if I die.
[47:41.12]Nope, I'm alive.
[47:43.36]Very cool.
[47:44.88]So there's a second boss in here.
[47:45.98]I wonder if I'm going to one-shot that, won't you?
[48:02.20]Two-shot, yeah.
[48:03.46]I was waiting for somebody to say that.
[48:04.89]I was waiting for you to say that.
[48:12.61]It's a fun fact, George RR Martin wrote every single message you see on the ground.
[48:16.11]Really?
[48:20.34]That's kind of cool.
[48:36.22]don't kill me don't kill me that's cool game fact alright so this is this this is just a boss alright that's
[48:58.28]So let me actually level up first in case I embarrass myself and die to a boss I'm probably 10 to 20 levels higher than.
[49:04.74]And everyone will Omega Lull and make fun of me.
[49:07.14]And I'll have to look over here and freak out and explain exactly why I died.
[49:11.76]Something about the button, the D-pad.
[49:13.21]I hit the D-pad the wrong way or something.
[49:17.15]Something about the D-pad.
[49:17.89]It's always about the D-pad.
[49:19.21]So.
[49:19.43]Alright, I can't level up.
[49:26.34]It's probably not that bad.
[49:27.62]It's probably fine.
[49:28.24]Let's get in there and do it.
[49:41.22]Cemetery shade.
[49:42.37]Okay.
[49:52.11]Okay.
[49:52.55]Alright, alright, alright.
[49:55.66]Have you heard of Jumping R2?
[49:57.12]Oh my god!
[50:00.55]What the fuck?
[50:01.93]I didn't even mean to kill him!
[50:04.75]Am I like a hundred levels too high for this?
[50:10.99]What the fuck was that?
[50:15.82]Alright, alright, but wait.
[50:16.80]But hold on.
[50:18.14]I'm only level 89.
[50:19.44]It's not like I'm that high.
[50:23.00]And this is... Alright.
[50:23.76]Alright.
[50:25.41]So my game progress route, I went like this way, and then this way, and then this way, and this way.
[50:38.45]So let me ask you something.
[50:39.60]Is doing the rainy witch quest line that took me like eight to ten hours, did that?
[50:48.90]Was I like under-leveled for that stuff but over-leveled for this stuff?
[50:56.11]I did Kayled too early.
[50:57.81]Really?
[51:04.47]Well, that's interesting.
[51:05.17]That's really interesting.
[51:08.32]This stuff is like during the academy.
[51:10.10]Really?
[51:10.48]Holy shit.
[51:11.94]Well, that's cool.
[51:12.52]Alright.
[51:14.44]Well, that's still fun though.
[51:15.48]It's just a dungeon.
[51:16.10]Whatever.
[51:16.40]100% Redan was very way, way, way, way, way, way too early.
[51:27.12]Oh.
[51:29.10]Well, that's really cool.
[51:30.66]That was sick.
[51:31.71]I like that.
[51:32.73]Let's kill this guy in fucking two hits too.
[51:34.35]Why not?
[51:39.47]I like being really powerful.
[51:40.79]Ooh.
[51:47.04]Ooh.
[51:47.20]This is actually really good.
[52:06.38]No more skin suit.
[52:07.84]No, I mean, this is fantastic.
[52:12.78]No armor?
[52:13.80]Oh no, what about the baby armor?
[52:15.24]It's okay.
[52:18.48]That's not even where I wanted to go.
[52:19.54]I wanted to go up there.
[52:21.06]At least I have a bonfire.
[52:28.33]Okay, I need to go down this road and bang a right.
[52:31.19]That's what we're doing.
[52:31.81]Because I can't... I'm not going to be able to figure it out.
[52:42.91]Dude, you're distracting me from my Mario Kart game.
[52:49.78]Um... Dude, don't worry.
[52:51.48]Just get in last place.
[52:53.22]And hold the blue shell until the last 10 seconds of the game.
[52:56.30]I think you'll be alright.
[52:56.98]Alright, here we go.
[52:59.94]Is there an Erdtree... ...Avatar over here?
[53:14.26]It's a bear again.
[53:15.04]I don't want to fight the bear again.
[53:21.96]I want to get up here.
[53:26.07]That.
[53:26.39]Is this thing alive?
[53:29.55]Is there like a gesture in front of it?
[53:49.34]Go get the bell, Pug.
[53:54.07]Alright, okay, so... I mean, I figured you were gonna do that.
[54:22.95]Um.
[54:23.13]Don't begin.
[54:36.67]The barnacle.
[54:38.53]Barnacles.
[54:44.73]All these things, oh.
[54:52.58]Really?
[54:52.90]I feel like this stuff... Are you making that up?
[55:26.72]I'm really glad you told me that because that would have taken an hour for me to figure out what the fuck was going on.
[55:40.18]Okay, so it's a building.
[55:54.77]With the remembrance duplication menu, you can duplicate remembrances you've previously acquired.
[56:00.98]This includes remembrances from which you've already drawn out power.
[56:05.80]Duplication can only perform once per mausoleum.
[56:12.82]So this is boss soul stuff?
[56:15.86]So I get to have another boss soul.
[56:24.20]You can get both boss soul items.
[56:27.78]Could I just take one of these and break it?
[56:32.26]You could do dual baby rattles.
[56:36.72]I can just take... Does this cost anything?
[56:38.66]Or I can only just do it once?
[56:40.23]So it's only one time... So where are the other ones?
[56:51.75]I killed way more than these two.
[56:53.55]Where's, um, like, Budrick and Margit and stuff?
[57:02.55]Around the map.
[57:03.39]There are other mausoleums.
[57:04.33]Different mausoleums, different turtle.
[57:05.87]Oh.
[57:07.57]So, I mean, is it worth me just breaking this and getting 100,000 souls and leveling up, like, three times?
[57:16.03]You can't do two of the same reward.
[57:17.45]You can only do the other one that you didn't pick.
[57:19.85]Oh, okay.
[57:26.10]I can't do dual baby rattles.
[57:34.34]If you don't want the other weapon, yeah.
[57:36.10]Which, I don't remember what they were.
[57:37.71]It's been a while.
[57:45.11]There's only two of, like, ten potential bosses that are here.
[57:48.09]Yeah, I probably... I don't think I'm going to do this yet.
[57:50.53]That's cool, though.
[57:55.81]It's really cool.
[58:01.08]Wait, you can do dual rattles?
[58:02.28]I feel like that would be kind of funny.
[58:06.50]And then I would be like, wow, that was 10,000 souls.
[58:08.40]And I'm going to go back to my catalyst now.
[58:10.37]Whatever this thing is.
[58:12.67]Staff, whatever.
[58:13.25]There's another one right there.
[58:16.55]Alright.
[58:20.99]I need to... So that's what's in this pond.
[58:23.08]Let me mark this.
[58:25.16]I'm gonna mark this as, uh, like a jewel, cause it's an item.
[58:29.24]I- I need to go to this Erdtree!
[58:32.97]Go up to one.
[58:33.69]I need to get up to the Erdtree.
[58:35.43]Where's the fucking road?
[58:36.39]Okay, I've gotta go this way.
[58:49.79]Jump up the cliff.
[58:52.51]Oh my goodness, are we okay?
[58:56.74]I think I'm okay.
[58:57.44]Yeah.
[59:00.56]I'm so paranoid about those jumps.
[59:02.10]Alright, here we go.
[59:09.63]Now we're going to wrap around here and go this way.
[59:12.05]We're going to go to the Urge Tree.
[59:15.29]I don't want to fight any of you.
[59:23.59]Here we go.
[59:25.65]I could see, I could open that too.
[59:29.41]But bonfire.
[59:32.59]Bonfire somewhere.
[59:35.78]Thank you.
[59:37.02]And it's not like in a dungeon on the ground somewhere.
[59:39.14]Thank God.
[59:44.88]Alright, I need to level up.
[59:52.99]Oops.
[59:56.37]Is that a magic flail?
[59:57.33]That is a magic flail.
[59:58.64]I still can't.
[59:59.36]47.
[60:00.66]Oh, shit.
[60:03.50]Okay.
[60:03.92]Well, whatever.
[60:13.38]Alright.
[60:13.98]Erdtree.
[60:15.92]This way.
[60:18.30]Okay, how do I get over there?
[60:19.82]I gotta go all the way around.
[60:20.82]There's probably a dungeon over there.
[60:29.76]Alright.
[60:32.40]Do I clean this one of the barnacles too?
[60:35.02]Might as well.
[60:40.25]Oh god.
[60:41.23]Oh god.
[60:44.61]What just happened?
[60:47.97]Somebody threw something at me.
[61:06.36]That's it.
[61:06.90]That leg.
[61:09.35]Yep.
[61:11.07]Yep!
[61:22.84]Did I do it?
[61:23.76]What's happening?
[61:25.26]Okay, I did it.
[61:25.86]So I'm assuming this is the same thing.
[61:36.35]I'm just going to say it is.
[61:37.07]It is what I got.
[61:48.72]That's really cool.
[61:49.66]So I don't need to make that decision now.
[61:51.52]Alright.
[61:55.80]Erdtree time.
[61:56.44]Let's go.
[61:56.78]Dungeon.
[62:00.01]Dungeon.
[62:03.84]hmm I would have put one right here if I was a game dev I just want to kill the avatar here
[62:31.77]There we go.
[62:32.35]Alright, let's kill the avatar.
[62:33.67]Give me the shit I'm looking for.
[62:35.93]I want more of those flask things.
[62:39.78]This shouldn't be too hard considering it's just an avatar.
[62:46.92]Spoilers for those that have not seen one of the avatars yet.
[62:51.77]They all follow the same exact formula.
[62:55.37]They are still fun though.
[62:58.27]Okay, let's kill this in three hits.
[63:03.59]I mistimed that.
[63:04.41]Okay.
[63:21.32]I don't want to fuck this up because considering I'm... I thought I was the body on the ground.
[63:26.89]I was like, why is this taking me fucking forever to get up?
[63:31.93]I thought I was the guy on the ground.
[63:34.39]That was another body.
[63:54.37]I'm getting so greedy.
[63:57.36]Oh fuck.
[63:58.02]I'm gonna die.
[64:03.06]Thank you.
[64:32.83]Really?
[64:33.27]Fuck you!
[64:34.33]What is this reach?
[64:36.49]Your reach is too high.
[64:40.35]I'm out of heals.
[64:58.15]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[64:59.47]I'm dead.
[65:04.01]I just like... I'm like so leveled for this area that I'm just like, I don't care.
[65:09.85]Whatever, just hit me.
[65:13.89]Like, I have to... I can't just like run into the guy and just swing at him.
[65:18.39]I'm just like, yeah, whatever.
[65:20.35]I'm fucking way higher than you.
[65:21.75]I'm just gonna fucking walk into you.
[65:35.11]Thank you.
[66:13.90]Are we who get the fuck out of here like seriously like get away from me I Was that guy just made that guy's pissed me off out the way he was looking at me I
[66:29.75]Good again, come on.
[66:46.06]Okay.
[66:47.60]I didn't like the way the guy was looking at me.
[66:51.89]What do I get for this?
[66:59.51]Magic shrouding cracked here.
[67:01.23]Lightning shrouding cracked here.
[67:02.49]Holy shrouding.
[67:03.33]Alright.
[67:04.09]One of those actually might be really good.
[67:12.18]Where is it?
[67:26.20]Oh, right here.
[67:26.54]Okay.
[67:27.14]What is it?
[67:28.19]Boost magic attacks?
[67:34.17]I kind of want to try it.
[67:37.69]Fire attack, lightning attack, magic attack.
[67:43.73]Because that would, for this, might be pretty good.
[67:51.55]That was it.
[67:51.83]Okay.
[67:53.38]Okay.
[67:54.99]We're good.
[67:55.47]I'm good on time.
[67:59.56]That's the Erdtree.
[68:00.28]That's good.
[68:08.27]Imagine that on a weapon.
[68:09.23]That would be... I wonder how much it increases it because that would be good for my L2.
[68:25.92]Alright, so that was the Erdtree.
[68:28.60]I went here.
[68:30.50]I still want to go here.
[68:31.66]And now I'm actually... Okay, I can actually get over there now.
[68:36.26]Go to five first.
[68:38.02]Fuck, it's still higher.
[68:38.95]Wait, this way.
[68:44.17]The physic effects are strong.
[68:55.23]How do I get up here?
[69:04.90]Over here?
[69:05.28]Maybe to go all the way around?
[69:27.09]From the flame village, really.
[69:28.53]It looks like I can go this way.
[69:41.85]All the way around here?
[69:43.17]Or from here?
[69:44.19]How high up is this fucking thing?
[69:56.97]I can see it, but I can't get to it.
[70:00.71]All the way around?
[70:01.25]Fuck.
[70:26.42]Missed it?
[70:41.21]I really want to get up there.
[70:42.13]Maybe it is from the Flame Village.
[70:48.62]You're right.
[70:52.40]You have to go in from the north.
[70:56.08]Let's try that.
[70:56.44]Because that's probably a sacred tier.
[70:58.61]It's probably a church.
[71:02.87]All the way around?
[71:03.61]Oh my lord!
[71:17.84]Go over the tree?
[71:34.61]Oh, do you mean physically go over the tree?
[71:36.19]Or do you mean like, you know, go over the tree.
[71:37.73]Like, examine the tree.
[71:39.55]I thought you meant go over the tree.
[71:41.67]Like, you gotta examine the tree.
[71:45.69]I don't think that's right.
[71:51.43]You were just being like a weirdo saying to like go on the tree.
[71:54.27]Okay, I'm just gonna keep going all the way.
[72:04.80]Alright, so dude how fucking much rock is around this place?
[72:17.41]How do I get out of here?
[72:23.68]Cross-examine the tree
[72:31.91]Dude, I don't even know how to physically get up there again.
[72:38.67]You know what I'm saying?
[72:39.33]Like, how did I even... What was it?
[72:41.83]Go to the village?
[72:44.27]I think I came... The village is up here.
[72:46.83]I can't... I don't think I can even go there anymore.
[72:51.25]Unless there's like a specific random way that I have to go.
[72:54.33]It's all blocked off by a giant wall.
[73:01.14]Like, this is, like, I can't go around this.
[73:07.30]How do I, do I, maybe I have to go all the way from here?
[73:09.20]Can I go from here?
[73:10.80]I'm gonna go over here.
[73:12.29]Because I think I actually went down, and there's, I don't think there's a way to get back up.
[73:23.37]Now if I wrap around, how do I get, let's see.
[73:32.24]do I approach this I go up here so I guess I'm gonna go up what's the number is that three
[74:06.54]Okay, so... I got... This is a million feet in the air.
[74:14.40]This is way higher than I thought it was gonna be.
[74:23.59]That's a million... That's at least 100,000 feet in the air.
[74:28.93]Nope.
[74:33.85]Holy shit!
[74:40.92]And then I gotta bang a right up here.
[74:42.46]I hope there's a bonfire up there.
[74:46.36]Alright, there's that.
[74:55.01]There's...
[75:12.08]Jesus.
[75:13.26]It's the back of the town lore?
[75:15.82]It's in the back of the lore town.
[75:21.20]I haven't seen this, whatever this is.
[75:22.66]This is new, whatever it is.
[75:26.63]Oh no, this is the lore town.
[75:32.27]Okay, so...
[75:48.32]I'd go this way.
[75:49.84]I'm trying to just take a look and see what... Do I have to jump on that and walk around and jump off there?
[76:05.39]I think that's what I have to do.
[76:10.70]I have to go through the town.
[76:17.30]Holy shit, there's one fucking specific way to get here.
[76:19.90]Okay, I'm in the town.
[76:32.08]I want to go this way.
[76:35.55]Like up here?
[76:46.21]This looks correct.
[76:50.42]Okay, alright.
[76:51.58]Holy my god.
[76:52.92]That was a pain in the ass.
[77:03.58]Lord Veik?
[77:04.24]It seems that you are no lord after all.
[77:06.15]Then where is he?
[77:07.05]Our true lord.
[77:07.81]Our lord Frenzied Flame.
[77:10.95]We beg of you, incinerate all the divides and distinguishes.
[77:13.49]May chaos take the world.
[77:14.63]Alright.
[77:16.41]I'm looking for that guy too.
[77:21.70]This is a brainless Jerma moment.
[77:24.04]Look at the map.
[77:25.50]There's one way to get here.
[77:28.61]You can't get here from any other fucking direction.
[77:31.21]Not a single other direction.
[77:33.25]But right here.
[77:35.67]That's it.
[77:37.41]That's it!
[77:56.84]Oh, you drinking piece of shit.
[78:00.64]Don't you know how leveled I am?
[78:13.89]Fingerprint Grape?
[78:15.87]And a War Spear.
[78:26.14]This is a faith weapon.
[78:27.48]Oh.
[78:27.54]I just wanna see it.
[78:35.84]Ooh.
[78:41.21]Can't do the ability, unfortunately.
[78:46.55]That's a cool weapon, though.
[78:48.17]Alright, get me the church.
[78:56.66]For those of you that haven't been watching Elden Ring streams and were tricked by the Mario Tennis stream, Jerma doesn't read chat.
[79:01.59]He just threatens to put people in meat grinders every few hours and rubs his eyes because he plays the game for too long.
[79:13.99]I love how you were tricked by Mario Tennis.
[79:18.88]Yeah, that's it.
[79:19.30]I'm going to funnel them all in.
[79:25.16]Mario, by the way, golf.
[79:26.99]It wasn't tennis.
[79:29.57]And I'm gonna bait and switch him into Elden Ring where I go like this for the next four hours.
[79:33.17]Fucking piece of shit.
[79:41.68]Fuck you.
[79:42.36]Fuck you.
[79:44.34]You got fucking baited.
[79:45.42]Ooh.
[79:46.94]Ooh.
[79:57.79]nothing uh special on this just looks interesting Finger Maiden robe okay yes
[80:27.49]Let's get to 40 vigor.
[80:28.55]Alright, that was worth coming all the way up here.
[80:35.39]Although, I mean, this map doesn't really help to explain that there's only one way to get here.
[80:44.92]And everywhere else is a gigantic mountain cliff.
[80:48.89]But I digress.
[80:50.61]I want to go over here.
[80:58.88]Or do I want to... You know what?
[81:00.72]No, no, no.
[81:03.19]I want to go across this bridge.
[81:13.03]Oh, right.
[81:13.33]Use the tear.
[81:15.30]That's smart.
[81:18.90]And I'm going to do the flask as well.
[81:20.44]Do I have any more of these?
[81:24.64]No.
[81:30.62]Okay.
[81:31.80]Alright.
[81:33.44]I think I want to do the magic one, see how good it is.
[81:36.06]And the heal.
[81:38.02]Or... The damage negation.
[81:41.90]Yeah.
[81:42.76]You can't go wrong with that.
[81:43.62]I'm very curious how good this is.
[81:46.10]I don't be that stupid.
[81:50.69]Okay.
[81:54.07]Okay.
[81:57.10]So I want to go on the main road.
[81:58.60]We're going to do main progress.
[82:03.04]Main progress.
[82:06.11]Although I think I went the wrong way.
[82:07.93]Wait.
[82:09.91]There's a merchant here.
[82:20.36]Hmm.
[82:22.82]You got kind of a dog shit inventory.
[82:27.50]Yeah, your inventory kind of sucks.
[82:28.34]Alright, is there a better way I can go through the church?
[82:44.91]Okay, go.
[82:47.06]We're going right through the gate.
[82:56.89]Okay, somebody said, Jerma, if I was in school with you, I would bully you.
[83:02.27]Oh, yeah?
[83:06.84]Oh, you think so, huh?
[83:08.68]Oh, you think so.
[83:11.32]You weren't here when I told you how fast I was.
[83:16.34]Give me your lunch money, Dodger.
[83:20.08]Come here, you little bastard!
[83:21.62]Dodge!
[83:22.47]Get behind you.
[83:23.45]Wedges!
[83:23.67]Where's my weapon?
[83:35.02]Yeah, this looks cool.
[83:40.60]Holy shit.
[83:44.73]I want to take this in.
[83:45.95]Don't rush me.
[84:02.51]Cool.
[84:05.53]What's this place?
[84:10.63]Greece?
[84:15.84]This is a big castle.
[84:18.60]Have I been here before?
[84:19.44]I think I was at the back part of this, right?
[84:31.19]He's finally here!
[84:32.73]He finally made it!
[84:33.89]Uh, I don't think this is the end of the game.
[84:40.21]Considering, um... All this.
[84:43.55]So no, I doubt this is the very end of the game.
[84:50.18]I could be wrong.
[84:54.00]Is there somewhere another path leading back to the foot of the Erdtree?
[84:58.62]An ancient tunnel.
[85:04.01]I'm about 70%.
[85:14.45]That's what I figured.
[85:16.39]Ran.
[85:24.49]Boys and girls.
[85:29.93]I came prepared.
[85:36.06]I came incredibly prepared.
[85:44.18]I got both halves of these medallions.
[86:11.34]The whole thing's going up.
[86:18.58]You didn't take the tunnel?
[86:23.91]Well, I mean, there's two ways to go, I guess.
[86:26.93]I...
[86:29.09]collected the two halves of this medallion across the world.
[86:33.24]So I get to do the skip.
[86:35.12]I get my Disney Fastpass.
[86:37.26]You gotta sit in line at Space Mountain for like fucking four hours.
[86:40.24]Damn.
[86:58.64]Where the hell am I?
[87:06.55]These... Those guys are... Altus Plateau.
[87:09.49]Alright.
[87:12.81]When everyone has a fast pass, no one will have one.
[87:16.85]Yeah, I mean... They do times now, right?
[87:21.82]Didn't it used to be if you had a fast pass, you just walked into the line?
[87:24.76]There was a fast pass lane, you just walked in it?
[87:28.89]That didn't last very long, did it?
[87:32.83]See, now it's like, when do you want to ride the Millennium Falcon ride?
[87:36.57]Uh, how does, like, 4.15 sound?
[87:39.23]And you come back at 4.15 and you get in another line, right?
[87:41.51]But it's, like, faster.
[87:46.19]This is really, really pretty.
[87:50.14]Sometimes the fast pass is just as long.
[87:52.46]Should I even kill these guys?
[87:53.34]Or am I gonna get, am I gonna get, uh, shit on here?
[87:55.70]Let's find out.
[88:06.29]Remember how much trouble these guys were giving me, like, 12 hours ago?
[88:11.68]20 hours ago in-game?
[88:13.36]I tried to fight one of these guys.
[88:15.78]Overleveled Andy.
[88:17.82]Look, I explored the world of the Elden Ring, okay?
[88:22.74]Just because I might be a little overleveled.
[88:24.54]I was exploring the world of the Lands Between.
[88:31.57]I got every tourist attraction hat...
[88:36.06]I got every mug from every part of Disney World.
[88:41.74]I would love to get over there.
[88:56.67]Over level.
[88:59.95]Giants are not aggressive.
[89:03.45]I have like four of those.
[89:08.97]A map fragment would be pog right now.
[89:18.16]Looks like fall here.
[89:21.76]Map fragment.
[89:23.34]Not on this map.
[89:24.88]Damn, okay.
[89:25.42]Well, let's keep going.
[89:30.37]Overleveled, underscaled.
[89:31.91]Actually, I've been doing pretty well in this game so far.
[89:36.10]You can go see the VODs.
[89:37.28]You can read the logs.
[89:40.37]What's this?
[89:47.89]Oh, I got an alien!
[89:56.43]Did he just shoot himself in the head with his arrow?
[89:59.11]What did he just do?
[90:01.41]I think he just shot himself in the head with his bow and arrow.
[90:04.27]I didn't hit him.
[90:10.03]Oh, I did.
[90:26.32]Am I a bit overleveled?
[90:27.38]I don't think so.
[90:28.64]But I've been exploring the lands of Elden Ring.
[90:40.37]I spent two days in Limgrave.
[90:43.75]It was a lot of fun.
[90:44.71]Oh, I want to try this thing.
[90:54.48]The Blast, maybe.
[91:00.18]Dude, cheese overpowered Andy.
[91:06.20]This is the first time I've ever seen this place.
[91:10.72]I'm telling you, it was the Witch Quest.
[91:11.96]I got so obsessed with it, and it ended up taking, like, it took, like, a full 10-hour day to beat the Witch Quest.
[91:18.33]I leveled up, like, 20 times doing the Witch Quest.
[91:27.39]I'm not, you're not, I'm not overleveled.
[91:28.98]Alright, yeah, I'm not overleveled.
[91:30.00]I'm fine.
[91:32.80]I just have this really strong weapon.
[91:39.55]I'll take a map fragment, please.
[91:40.51]Yeah, I slingshot myself.
[91:47.57]I did the witch quest way too early, and it was really difficult, and I, like, went to Redan wicked early, and way, way too early, and then I got a shitload of souls from doing that.
[91:56.12]Wham!
[91:56.60]And I launched myself into the stratosphere.
[92:07.81]This is great, though.
[92:12.67]Is that a map thingy right there?
[92:15.43]Yes!
[92:16.39]There's one here, and there's one here.
[92:18.15]Let's get them both.
[92:31.12]You were overleveled for Verdant.
[92:32.60]And now I know that's bait bullshit.
[92:37.42]Now I know that that's bait bullshit.
[92:58.45]Old Fang?
[92:59.15]Okay.
[93:03.91]Nobody is overleveled for Rodan.
[93:05.65]That's true.
[93:08.75]Oh Erdtree, great Erdtree, the Golden Order itself unwavering stretched to the sky.
[93:14.23]Confer your guidance to our Elden Lord to put this weary world to rights.
[93:21.33]We're getting close to this thing.
[93:32.60]Is Redan still your least favorite boss?
[93:34.60]Yeah.
[93:35.98]Without a doubt.
[93:47.66]One of the game's hardest bosses.
[93:50.16]Yeah, it's just, I don't know.
[93:52.60]It was a cool idea.
[93:53.70]But, I don't know.
[93:55.37]I'd rather just fight the guy instead of just running around like a dickhead with like a thousand summons.
[93:59.91]I guess you can.
[94:00.55]But, it'd be hard.
[94:05.47]Alright.
[94:05.63]Alright.
[94:07.94]Bird tree in the middle.
[94:10.20]Dungeon here.
[94:11.00]Thing here.
[94:12.80]Bird tree.
[94:15.14]Oh my god, I'm gonna throw up on stream.
[94:20.78]And then whatever this is.
[94:21.50]Alright, let's begin.
[94:36.81]Ooh.
[94:42.93]Ooh, what's that?
[94:43.39]Is that one of those tortoise missions?
[94:50.89]I don't want to do a tortoise mission right now.
[95:01.20]What's going on there?
[95:11.93]You fucking die.
[95:18.52]What is this big banner?
[95:27.84]Ah.
[95:29.36]Hello.
[95:37.02]Do you take your fingers and go like that?
[95:38.94]Like here?
[95:51.51]What?
[95:52.39]What?
[95:54.07]Ruins of gold.
[95:55.21]I don't know.
[95:57.84]I'm just imagining, like, let me read them.
[96:06.16]Ah, yes.
[96:06.78]To the west.
[96:08.28]That, right?
[96:08.80]Only more...
[96:22.57]Alright.
[96:26.01]So... What you're saying is get in that castle and slay the goddamn demon.
[96:29.31]You can do that.
[96:36.86]Alright.
[96:41.52]We have some things to look at here first.
[96:42.78]I hear a merchant...
[96:51.12]Merchant?
[97:00.99]I heard like the... Ah, there you are.
[97:03.99]Ooh, you got way better stuff.
[97:10.83]Free surcoat?
[97:21.90]Frosty Tower Shield.
[97:23.94]Scorpion Kite Shield.
[97:28.61]Damn.
[97:33.55]Did I get some of this cookbook stuff?
[97:41.12]Imp Shades, Unseen Assassins.
[97:45.14]Ancient Dragons Apostle Cookbook.
[97:46.66]That sounds important.
[97:52.87]You got great stuff.
[97:56.39]What are you talking about?
[97:57.66]You got some of the best stuff I've seen so far.
[97:59.04]Alright, where's this going to take me?
[98:12.91]What did that unlock?
[98:16.61]Anything cool?
[98:17.17]Not really.
[98:29.09]That's actually a really good tip.
[98:32.57]Somebody said I can hit X on it.
[98:35.05]It'll show me... That's kind of where I wanted to go.
[99:07.99]East Windmill Pasture.
[99:12.39]Can I dance too?
[99:21.20]Ah!
[99:24.74]What the fuck?
[99:33.46]I didn't even do anything!
[99:34.46]What the?
[99:35.36]Why are you mad at me?
[99:36.24]I actually didn't do anything.
[99:40.37]Fuck the whole goddamn group then!
[99:56.50]Oops.
[99:57.40]That's not a heal anymore.
[99:58.50]Okay, cool.
[99:59.36]That was weird.
[100:06.94]What were you playing with?
[100:09.10]Twinned Night Swords?
[100:12.08]What's that?
[100:19.41]Twinned Night Swords?
[100:23.91]Strength?
[100:24.73]Scaling?
[100:27.37]Oh, it's a... It's a Darth Maul.
[100:32.90]Dual-handed spinning attacks.
[100:40.48]Yep.
[100:49.25]I always wanted to use one of these in these Souls games.
[100:51.85]Like the halberds or like the spinners.
[101:00.06]Things you hold in two hands and spin around like poles.
[101:06.62]You should respec.
[101:07.46]Not this late into the game.
[101:08.58]I've got my thing going on here.
[101:12.21]That was really cool.
[101:12.89]Alright.
[101:14.79]So what's the point with the windmill?
[101:23.62]Do I jump on it, right?
[101:25.18]Or like attack it?
[101:25.72]I'm gonna jump on it.
[101:31.52]You definitely get on it.
[101:32.22]I would be shocked if you didn't actually get on this.
[101:38.05]Somehow.
[101:49.76]Guess not.
[101:53.78]No way in.
[102:00.27]What's the significance of this thing?
[102:07.17]I don't know.
[102:10.09]Oh, there's just a ton of these.
[102:12.97]Oh.
[102:13.97]Never mind.
[102:17.39]Never mind.
[102:18.75]We're gonna go... We're gonna go to the Erdtree.
[102:22.53]I'm going that way.
[102:28.78]I got cool clothes.
[102:29.66]Yeah, I'll take... I'll look at them in a minute.
[102:33.72]Let me go get this avatar.
[102:41.58]It's one of those golden bugs.
[102:57.33]Protection of the Erdtree.
[102:58.59]That's a faith spell.
[103:03.73]Bro, look at the new clothes.
[103:05.44]I will just wait.
[103:06.90]What's this?
[103:07.30]What's on the door?
[103:15.71]Okay, what'd I get?
[103:16.33]Increases mind.
[103:24.23]Somebody's here.
[103:25.09]Yeah.
[103:32.72]That is a mana hood.
[103:35.28]Although, I don't think... I think having the intellect from the cat helmet is better.
[103:39.78]Alright, archery.
[103:45.66]Let's go.
[103:49.20]Did you find the Elden Ring?
[103:52.62]I did.
[103:52.90]It's this.
[103:56.66]It's just that this is a big circle and the Elden Ring is going to be the lands that the Elden Lords used to occupy.
[104:03.14]And it's going to be a huge thing at the end of the game when there's no thing for you to take.
[104:07.80]It's not like, oh, the Elden Ring.
[104:10.24]No, no, bro.
[104:11.69]It's not all about material shit.
[104:14.69]That's the message they're going to give us.
[104:18.51]It's the Elden Ring of the lands.
[104:20.61]It's the land.
[104:22.68]Not the, oh, it's a big shiny thing you put on your finger.
[104:25.68]Nope, it's the land.
[104:31.89]Oh, I want to go to the tree.
[104:42.92]That's cool, whatever that is.
[104:45.78]Ooh, ruins, that means there's a dungeon!
[104:51.52]It's just an onion ring.
[104:55.74]That's a fucking person.
[104:57.62]I thought that was a decoration.
[105:02.37]Yeah, light it.
[105:04.75]Dude, look, I just want to get this bug.
[105:06.33]What, I'm dead?
[105:12.78]What even killed me?
[105:35.47]What the fuck is that?
[105:36.67]That's not an avatar.
[105:42.65]That's not an Earth Tree avatar.
[105:44.52]Is it?
[106:04.93]Get over here!
[106:05.35]What's this laggy glitch shit?
[106:09.25]Golden slam.
[106:10.07]Alright.
[106:30.18]Okay.
[106:34.09]These guys freak me out.
[106:35.39]I don't like these guys.
[106:44.27]I don't like the sounds they make either.
[106:46.30]These guys make terrible sounds.
[106:53.28]Well, there's definitely a dungeon, so let's find it.
[106:54.72]I hate that thing.
[107:07.91]Or is there?
[107:08.37]It has to be, right?
[107:12.19]Got to be a way down.
[107:15.68]Are they on top of it?
[107:25.24]Here.
[107:53.33]Where's this guy going?
[107:55.53]No, dude.
[107:56.51]Dude, don't go over here.
[107:58.81]You don't want to go over here.
[107:59.81]Is he alive?
[108:02.81]Follow him.
[108:04.47]He's walking into a bunch of minions.
[108:05.95]I don't want to go over this way.
[108:20.72]They're not happy.
[108:23.78]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[108:25.32]Wherever you're going.
[108:25.94]Dude, we've got company behind us.
[108:33.27]I don't... You know what?
[108:34.25]Don't look behind you.
[108:36.03]I'll handle everything.
[108:37.17]Just walk like normally.
[108:38.59]Don't worry.
[108:39.13]Nothing's wrong.
[108:43.03]What?
[108:44.58]Oh, that's an instant kill.
[108:50.62]An instant kill move.
[108:53.24]I forgot.
[108:54.52]I mean, the bar is grey, so it kind of blends into the... He's fucking mad at video games and he sucks and he's an idiot and I don't like him.
[109:02.37]You know what I mean, though?
[109:04.81]Why am I this far away?
[109:08.91]Where did this just put me?
[109:12.91]Wait.
[109:26.58]item down here.
[109:28.19]Ooh, golden arrows.
[109:36.15]Those are probably good.
[109:43.22]Use the teleporter?
[109:43.90]I kind of wanted to see what was down here.
[109:44.98]Alright.
[109:48.40]How scared of these guys should I actually be?
[109:51.50]Alright.
[109:53.65]And by the way, I'm going to watch this guy from afar.
[109:55.67]I'm not going to follow behind him.
[110:00.16]I'll watch this guy with fucking binoculars.
[110:12.12]Okay, where was it?
[110:16.55]Why is it so magical looking right here?
[110:20.25]Why is that so magical looking?
[110:25.45]This is very magical.
[110:26.69]Why is it so magical looking?
[110:38.06]Alright.
[110:40.90]Where was that?
[110:41.30]That was back here.
[110:43.10]Touch that thing.
[110:45.10]And... Okay.
[110:47.18]I'm going to literally just watch him from afar.
[110:54.43]Alright, go ahead.
[110:55.43]Go do your thing.
[111:06.55]Okay, he walks through these people.
[111:08.25]Oh, I think this might be the Elden Lord.
[111:34.13]Now where are you going?
[111:35.43]This would be actually really funny.
[111:37.50]If I follow this guy for like five minutes.
[111:39.56]And he goes behind a tree and takes a piss.
[111:42.55]And then... Just vanishes.
[112:03.28]Oh, get where you're going, man.
[112:17.27]What is this guy doing?
[112:39.45]Dude.
[112:56.06]We're walking to like the edge of the Earth.
[113:04.77]Okay.
[113:05.61]He turned.
[113:07.35]We're going right here, aren't we?
[113:14.42]We're literally going over there, aren't we?
[113:20.35]It was already marked on my map, I didn't even need this guy!
[113:22.63]He's leading you... It's a dungeon.
[113:35.74]He's literally gonna walk into it and he's gonna point.
[113:47.26]I was gonna come here anyways.
[113:48.64]Well, we're here.
[113:49.53]Might as well.
[113:52.59]Pay him.
[113:52.89]I'm not paying him.
[114:01.51]Pay him.
[114:07.12]That's kind of cool, though.
[114:12.38]Can I go down?
[114:13.98]Nope.
[114:16.20]Altus Tunnel.
[114:18.71]Alright, what have we got?
[114:28.57]Dungeon.
[114:31.27]This looks like another Smithing Stone tunnel.
[114:34.28]Oh, definitely.
[114:37.44]Oh, sorry.
[114:37.84]Excuse me.
[114:39.64]Overleveled Andy coming through.
[114:44.92]rune arc.
[114:45.28]I should take a rune arc, too, just to add insult to injury.
[114:47.52]Just walk around here with a rune arc and just be unbeatable.
[114:54.89]Unstoppable.
[115:11.98]Dark.
[115:13.04]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[115:15.96]What is this thing?
[115:22.04]Ugh.
[115:22.63]I think I've seen a version of those.
[115:35.83]Crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals, crystals.
[115:40.63]Alright, what about, can I get up here?
[115:57.10]gonna be those shrimp things here right I actually do need these so this is bad not this is not bad this is great
[116:22.88]Do you get the urge to play the Legion's Mansion from this game?
[116:24.98]Not really, no.
[116:25.98]Imagine if I was still using the katana.
[116:36.33]I would kill these guys all in one hit.
[116:37.59]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[116:47.62]Don't be an idiot.
[116:50.81]I don't know what that was behind me, but something happened.
[116:53.78]What is it making?
[116:59.24]Is it you?
[117:05.78]Oh, Jesus.
[117:06.44]It's one of those things.
[117:17.75]Just walk through the wall for like five straight seconds.
[117:29.88]Okay, let me go this way.
[117:39.41]These are Smithing Stone 5.
[117:47.30]Nerd's rope strikes again?
[117:48.42]Yeah.
[117:48.60]I don't want to miss anything.
[118:00.14]See, my problem with games like this, especially like Elden Ring, this one in particular, is I want to see all the cool stuff, and I know that I can play another character and just go the ways that I didn't go, but I want everything.
[118:13.69]I want all the items.
[118:14.89]I want all the stuff.
[118:16.37]I want all the gear, even if it's not for me.
[118:19.57]I want the strength ring.
[118:21.23]I want the strength talisman.
[118:22.67]I just want it.
[118:23.15]Give it to me.
[118:24.82]What about a new game?
[118:26.30]Yeah, I mean, but I want it now.
[118:32.56]And you've skipped half the stuff already.
[118:33.98]Isn't that interesting?
[118:35.20]That's how you know there's so much to do in this game.
[118:40.58]That you could play through this probably five times.
[118:42.42]These are alive.
[118:43.30]Alright, well, let's kill this boss.
[118:51.08]Make it quick.
[119:09.85]It is.
[119:10.27]Oh no.
[119:11.08]It's one of those...
[119:27.39]I need to parry this.
[119:28.07]Do I have shield equipped?
[119:31.41]I don't.
[119:33.23]Maybe not.
[119:33.63]Depends on how much damage I'm doing.
[119:40.57]I'd still like to.
[119:41.43]Ow.
[120:09.10]Not worth it.
[120:20.43]I need to parry this.
[120:21.13]I need to shield equip.
[120:35.83]Ooh!
[120:38.16]Excuse me.
[120:38.56]Holy shit, I instantly killed him.
[120:42.20]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[120:48.86]Oh my god.
[121:05.85]somberstone miner's bell bearing they take a ton from crits seems like it cool don't want the katana no I like the baby rattle I think it's really good god I hate one hit moves
[121:34.84]Hey, it's only fair that I get them too.
[121:37.33]Only on one or two enemies.
[121:38.65]I think, was that it?
[121:44.61]I can imagine my frustration if I was here ten levels ago.
[121:51.56]But, just get fucking absolutely stomped.
[122:01.32]This weapon is called the Bastard's Stars.
[122:05.34]That's a cool dungeon.
[122:06.58]So now, let's go here.
[122:14.98]So this is pointing me this way.
[122:21.75]I wonder if it's this area here.
[122:24.65]Up here.
[122:30.19]We're going to go there eventually.
[122:31.16]Alright, let's...
[122:33.40]Let me check this place out first.
[122:35.24]Because I'm right here.
[122:35.84]There's also these ruins, but... I want to see what this is.
[122:47.93]Oh, a fucking gigantic brick wall.
[122:52.49]Never mind.
[122:55.85]Do the Ur-Tree, boss.
[122:59.90]I am right here.
[123:00.46]Yeah, I'll try it.
[123:03.06]I only have two.
[123:03.56]I didn't sit down.
[123:04.28]Shit.
[123:16.07]Must have already got it.
[123:29.02]Is this the boss?
[123:31.94]Or is this the boss?
[123:36.91]Holy shit.
[123:37.97]Worm.
[123:38.69]It's actually, his name is Worm Face?
[123:51.08]Oh, I hate this guy.
[124:01.83]Oh my god, I did so much fucking damage.
[124:17.29]I got distracted I got distracted I did do so much damage I just did more
[124:41.27]before I can do a move.
[124:57.74]I'm going... I gotta stay away.
[125:26.36]Oh!
[125:33.36]No no no no no no no no.
[125:44.64]Don't grab me.
[125:45.38]You're almost dead.
[125:53.04]Got him.
[125:58.58]Okay.
[125:58.90]Really nice.
[125:59.88]Good.
[126:00.14]Good.
[126:00.28]Good.
[126:00.50]Very good.
[126:00.86]Cool.
[126:07.35]He... Oh, he used magic.
[126:09.37]PogChamp.
[126:12.40]That was cool.
[126:13.80]Oh, I can go in here though.
[126:16.88]Wait.
[126:18.72]I could have always gone in there.
[126:22.12]Yes.
[126:22.32]Alright, I've been here.
[126:23.33]Alright, let's keep going.
[126:27.89]I want to look at those tiers.
[126:29.79]But I want to go the direction of... I want to go up.
[126:36.41]I want to go this way towards five.
[126:45.94]Why is the stream quality weird?
[126:47.46]You didn't change it from 1080p from Mario?
[126:52.74]What do you mean?
[126:58.78]It was 864.
[126:59.82]It was always 864.
[127:01.80]Alright, I think I can jump up this.
[127:16.38]Alright.
[127:18.14]Okay.
[127:18.82]That looks that's where I want to go.
[127:35.39]That's going to take me to.
[127:36.97]Alright.
[127:39.27]That's what this bullshit is from.
[127:42.17]That's the Erdtree.
[127:43.59]That's the big Erdtree.
[127:44.91]I actually, I really want to see this.
[127:47.15]I want to know what the secret is under there.
[127:48.71]I want to know what it is.
[127:53.93]I guarantee you.
[127:55.49]I guarantee you we're going to get down there.
[127:56.73]We're going to beat the game and shit.
[127:58.63]And you're going to come out the birth canal.
[128:01.75]I'm telling you.
[128:15.48]Okay, don't be a fucking idiot.
[128:16.74]You might be an over-leveled weirdo.
[128:19.70]What am I kidding?
[128:20.30]Who cares?
[128:20.68]These guys can't hurt me.
[128:23.79]But if they work together, they can.
[128:25.25]Blast.
[128:28.77]They're working together.
[128:32.25]Alone, I can destroy them all.
[128:34.43]But together, they're strong.
[128:49.06]Villain arc.
[128:50.38]That's literally a villain speech.
[128:54.02]I mean, that's just... I'm just speaking factual information.
[129:01.96]Ooh, that's good.
[129:10.18]Where is this on the map?
[129:11.73]Well, I'm going the way... I don't want to go this way.
[129:15.91]Do I?
[129:16.23]Okay, I do.
[129:21.99]let's see it wow capital outskirts what's the point of this game um this
[129:55.27]It's one of those Evergales right there.
[130:02.19]What?
[130:06.95]He's back?
[130:08.99]Wait, why is he back?
[130:10.15]I don't wanna fight this dickhead again.
[130:20.74]Oh, Taan is dying back as a regular enemy because you're going to kick the shit out of me in probably four swings.
[130:34.54]Nope.
[130:35.36]No, I'm not going to kill him in four swings.
[130:47.60]I gotta remember how to fight against Margit.
[130:51.26]Which it's been, like, it's been like two weeks.
[131:15.52]UGH!
[131:35.34]no that was so much it was so greedy to do that
[131:52.82]Let's get funky.
[131:53.82]Wanna get funky?
[132:30.43]Ooh, 905 damage.
[132:32.27]That was a lot.
[132:32.89]See you later, Margit.
[132:33.55]Now what?
[132:46.75]Viridian Amber Medallion plus one.
[132:54.55]What's that?
[132:58.41]Greatly raises maximum stamina.
[133:01.84]That's kind of a big deal.
[133:07.36]Was it 13%?
[133:07.60]Hmm.
[133:07.76]He's probably going to come back again.
[133:15.01]Maybe.
[133:16.45]That was cool, though.
[133:23.51]I want that map fragment before I do anything else.
[133:34.46]I think I have enough.
[133:35.40]Give me the map.
[133:46.07]I'm going to the... Yes, I am.

[139:37.34]Turn the camera, I don't want it on.
[139:38.68]I'm back.
[139:52.03]Wait.
[139:53.57]At the bottom of Lendel, Frenzied Flamelord.
[139:56.57]That's where it just was.
[140:01.29]So this is Lendel?
[140:07.83]Underneath Lendel.
[140:08.55]That's kind of cool.
[140:18.63]Alright.
[140:19.29]Let's start the trek all the fucking way back.
[140:23.55]Number two.
[140:24.09]Go on.
[140:38.48]Big wall.
[140:40.38]Um... I think... Oh, I have to go all the way around.
[140:47.00]It doesn't matter.
[140:47.72]I have to go from that bonfire.
[141:48.50]Okay.
[141:50.56]Down this road.
[141:51.48]Just follow the road.
[141:52.26]I'm not going off the road.
[141:53.50]No matter what.
[141:56.70]Just follow the road.
[141:57.44]No matter what.
[141:58.00]I'm not going off the road unless for a Grace.
[142:08.69]No matter what.
[142:10.77]Only for a Grace.
[142:12.31]If I see one on the road.
[142:28.68]So far so good.
[142:30.33]I'm very happy with this outcome.
[142:40.31]Okay.
[142:40.84]Good.
[142:41.94]Things are going good.
[142:46.56]Watch out for the... They throw shit at you now.
[143:01.94]Where did that come from?
[143:07.72]I gotta go fight that guy.
[143:09.16]I wanna go kill that thing.
[143:11.73]I do need to find a bonfire through here, though.
[143:13.57]I wanna fight that winged guy.
[143:15.15]I didn't wanna kill it this time.
[143:17.63]And I got pretty close.
[143:18.67]It's just, I got all screwed up.
[143:19.87]That was a cool fight.
[143:22.59]I wanna fight that thing again.
[143:23.51]How did I not touch this?
[143:29.06]How is it possible that I missed this?
[143:31.92]Was I just so dumbstruck by how cool this world was?
[143:36.06]How did I miss this?
[143:40.30]That's impossible.
[143:41.23]Okay, that makes this a million times easier.
[143:47.91]This wants me to go over here, but I'm not doing that yet.
[143:49.99]I need that map fragment.
[143:57.95]I lost 50,000 souls.
[143:59.43]Whatever it is, it's fine.
[144:00.39]I'm going to fight this thing.
[144:06.86]This guy back here.
[144:09.08]I'm gonna get him.
[144:11.46]You'll see.
[144:16.34]Alright.
[144:16.62]Let's go.
[144:27.33]Where is he?
[144:32.43]Where is he?
[144:42.25]Only R1s.
[144:42.73]Oh, come on.
[145:03.49]Not this shit again.
[145:30.29]My god, man.
[145:31.33]Fucking relax.
[145:35.99]Relax!
[146:04.66]Thank you.
[146:38.74]Alright.
[146:46.66]What'd you drop?
[146:49.47]What do you got?
[146:54.83]Gargoyle's Greataxe.
[146:56.01]Only 3 2500 souls?
[146:56.95]That's it?
[146:57.65]That's it.
[147:12.28]Is that another seed?
[147:12.96]Seed.
[147:16.02]Seed.
[147:16.22]Seed.
[147:16.40]Seed.
[147:16.56]Seed.
[147:16.72]Seed.
[147:18.28]There's another one right here.
[147:19.08]Are there two?
[147:23.61]Why are they just... They're giving these away like candy right now.
[147:34.07]Oh shit.
[147:42.53]I missed one up here.
[147:50.99]Where did I miss one?
[147:55.81]Just touch the Grace.
[147:58.53]It's all the way back up.
[147:59.68]Oh, okay.
[148:03.26]So is this the last area?
[148:06.38]Or no, there's more here.
[148:07.34]There's something else right here.
[148:16.65]Oh, there's a lot more.
[148:17.89]Wow.
[148:19.29]This is ridiculous.
[148:20.19]This is ridiculous.
[148:23.44]There's a ton more underground, too.
[148:30.06]Wow.
[148:35.08]I had two flasks.
[148:36.39]I had eight golden seeds.
[148:38.19]Are you shitting me?
[148:41.81]I didn't know that.
[148:44.97]Ten and two, that sounds good.
[148:53.07]Alright.
[148:53.81]I'm very curious.
[148:56.38]Look at this.
[148:56.86]Okay.
[149:03.56]Is this shit down here?
[149:07.91]Alright.
[149:09.01]I think... I want to find the way to connect this.
[149:15.03]Just to have the bonfire and connect it.
[149:20.10]So I'm going to keep going through here because I want to find the connection here.
[149:24.74]I'm assuming I'm going to be going this way.
[149:29.69]Not this way.
[149:31.15]Wait.
[149:33.65]This way.
[149:35.55]Yes.
[149:35.99]Yes.
[149:36.93]Yes.
[149:37.74]Yes.
[149:50.32]Go through the doors.
[149:52.56]I'm already going this way.
[149:59.43]Alright, so if I go up here... Because I already have a bonfire that's all the way up.
[150:05.71]Is this what you're saying?
[150:12.99]I missed one?
[150:13.49]I did miss one.
[150:15.95]That's crazy.
[150:16.71]Okay.
[150:19.13]This way.
[150:25.13]Alright, let's go.
[150:43.22]What the hell are you guys even doing here anymore?
[150:51.92]Damn it.
[151:00.47]They're just chilling.
[151:01.45]Why are they... Just get out of here.
[151:20.89]Okay.
[151:22.65]Can I open the front door?
[151:28.92]Lost Ashes of War.
[151:33.50]I definitely cannot go in this way.
[151:38.28]So, there's two ways I can go.
[151:40.56]Down, through the lake, or up and around by the Erdtree.
[151:43.96]And we're going to go to the Erdtree anyways, because I want more of the flask shit.
[151:48.46]So, we're going to wrap around here.
[151:49.46]I'm going to check out what's going on in this little thing here.
[152:00.73]Oh, fuck.
[152:01.37]I'm fine.
[152:05.40]But I'm here.
[152:47.17]Let's go.
[152:50.65]How's the radish garden going?
[152:51.97]Um, it's not, it's going pretty good.
[152:53.49]That guy's holding a box.
[152:59.43]That guy was holding a 12 golden rune.
[153:03.65]That guy had just a fucking treasure chest.
[153:30.66]Hey.
[153:31.62]I'm trying to stun him.
[154:06.81]Use the nebula, bro.
[154:07.93]Be one with the stars.
[154:13.54]Alright.
[154:16.90]Dude, use the nebula, bro.
[154:19.51]Be one with the stars.
[154:20.87]That's my favorite part.
[154:21.61]Of what you just said.
[154:24.27]Okay, up.
[154:41.05]Ah, I can go up here.
[154:47.34]Nebula is only good when I'm very confident that I can get its utilization down.
[154:52.38]Can't just do it just willy-nilly.
[155:04.85]What the fuck is that?
[155:11.82]Stop!
[155:15.98]There we go.
[155:16.32]Alright, what's up here?
[155:18.67]Something weird.
[155:19.33]Something interesting.
[155:27.69]Probably right in the middle.
[155:35.56]Mmm.
[155:49.63]These skulls are alive?
[155:50.55]The fuck?
[156:05.94]I guarantee if I come back here at midnight, there's gonna be a giant skull boss thing here.
[156:13.24]You fight something here.
[156:14.45]There's no way you don't.
[156:36.83]Guide Andy.
[156:37.45]Nope.
[156:39.15]I'm just telling you.
[156:43.09]That's what I think happens.
[156:44.91]It might not happen, but that's what I think.
[156:55.00]Ooh.
[157:00.02]That's not even from an Erdtree.
[157:04.88]Okay.
[157:07.73]Oh, I gotta investigate that shit.
[157:09.79]What's going on down there?
[157:10.67]There's like a little congregation down there.
[157:15.48]I'm going.
[157:15.78]Let's go.
[157:20.78]Is that the Erdtree, boss?
[157:22.48]I don't know what that is, but I wanna go.
[157:23.90]Come on, come on, come on.
[157:24.56]I wanna go now.
[157:25.08]I wanna go now.
[157:25.54]I don't wanna wait.
[157:39.28]Okay, here we go.
[157:41.14]What's going on down here?
[157:45.70]It is an archery boss.
[157:46.52]What was that?
[158:10.97]What the fuck?
[158:23.14]Not too much trouble.
[158:29.59]What do we got?
[158:35.15]That's it?
[158:35.71]Okay.
[158:38.23]Easy, yep.
[158:41.41]Golden Sunflower.
[158:44.45]Oh, that's not the item.
[158:47.41]Twiggy Cracked tier.
[158:48.87]Crimson Crystal tier.
[158:52.87]Dungeon?
[158:57.54]No?
[158:59.32]I gotta look at what some of these are.
[159:00.50]This guy's cracked out.
[159:05.90]I'm getting a little tired, but I wouldn't say I'm... I think I'm the reverse of cracked out right now.
[159:10.74]I think I cracked out all my potential crack during the brain age portion of the stream, which sapped me of all my brain cells.
[159:21.94]Oh, okay.
[159:22.30]That's a giant.
[159:25.67]Very cool.
[159:26.03]There's definitely a dungeon down here.
[159:35.78]Absolutely a dungeon over here somewhere.
[159:46.58]On the edge somewhere?
[159:47.40]Come on.
[159:51.59]There's gotta be one.
[159:52.39]Come on!
[159:55.97]Dungeon finding Daniel?
[159:57.39]Yeah, it's one of the coolest parts of the whole game.
[159:59.87]It is, in fact, probably the coolest part of the whole game.
[160:07.06]Alright, well you have to stop that now.
[160:12.51]What?
[160:13.11]Oh, he's shooting now.
[160:25.15]Of course he is.
[160:39.32]All of you, stop.
[160:39.92]Oh, please.
[161:12.23]Ugh!
[161:13.20]1875 damage.
[161:14.30]Alright.
[161:28.12]Now let's kill this guy.
[161:32.66]These legs are blocked.
[161:34.62]So we have to play this smartly.
[161:36.20]Get a free hit.
[161:42.23]We've already fought one of these guys before.
[161:43.81]I have lots of experience.
[162:14.97]I forgot about that one.
[162:30.74]Get over there and hit his hands, please!
[162:32.68]Shut up.
[162:41.55]Gotta be on his left.
[162:50.13]Here we go.
[163:02.83]Hands down.
[163:03.31]Come on.
[163:04.97]Thank you.
[163:14.94]Yes, he has a hundred trillion health.
[163:16.54]I know.
[163:44.35]His legs can break?
[163:46.81]Did I try that already?
[163:50.46]Are you full of shit?
[164:01.79]Are you full of shit or what?
[164:21.04]You throw me off my game.
[164:22.60]I'm just going to fight him the way I know how to fight him.
[164:38.91]Alright, now he's dead.
[164:53.38]Goodbye.
[164:56.04]No!
[164:56.64]I want an item!
[164:57.78]I wanted the item!
[164:58.96]What did he drop?
[165:01.28]Oh my fucking god.
[165:02.99]What did he have?
[165:04.13]He just...
[165:24.55]You just get the axe.
[165:26.25]Really, that's it?
[165:30.00]I swear those guys have a chance to drop something better.
[165:33.12]Their helmet or something.
[165:34.02]Or, like, their armor.
[165:43.50]No, don't even say it.
[165:44.71]Don't tell me, because now I'm, like, realizing, like, that doesn't make any sense.
[165:49.29]How would I wear that?
[165:49.93]It would be huge.
[166:04.63]I want a bonfire before I go over there.
[166:15.68]Ooh.
[166:19.34]There isn't one.
[166:30.53]Really?
[166:50.55]That looked like you could land on that.
[166:55.61]That looked not that far away.
[166:56.95]And he's like, go straight down.
[167:12.13]You and I just died at the exact same time.
[167:14.55]Was that the same place?
[167:15.83]That would be funny.
[167:19.66]Okay, well, I'm going to go fight this thing, whatever it is.
[167:29.37]You can drop a crystal.
[167:30.73]What was it?
[167:32.83]You can drop a rainbow stone to see if you'll die from a drop.
[167:37.61]I can't believe I didn't know that.
[167:39.19]That's such amazing info.
[167:42.33]I can drop a stone off, and if the stone shatters, then I die.
[167:49.36]what okay well thanks for the tip Dr josh tried to share this info before alright let's go fight this guy up here I should be able to do it let's go tell me there's not another bonfire like right here or somewhere
[168:17.07]Sitting right here.
[168:19.05]Not a bonfire.
[168:19.81]It has to be one.
[168:22.75]It has to be.
[168:24.89]Right?
[168:25.07]Maybe not.
[168:40.61]Ah.
[168:41.73]Okay.
[168:43.54]I didn't... What?
[168:44.22]I didn't see it?
[168:46.67]How did I not see it?
[168:48.01]I walked right over here.
[168:48.83]Alright.
[168:51.53]Tree Sentinel version 2.
[168:53.25]Let's go.
[168:53.63]Draconic Tree Sentinel actually is.
[169:00.66]We got new moves.
[169:07.36]Okay.
[169:22.45]I'll be foolish, it's not hard.
[169:56.48]My god.
[170:01.45]Can I outrun it?
[170:26.08]If I just keep running in a direction?
[170:38.94]Oh, it feels good when you get the fucking fully charged one.
[170:41.68]Do it again.
[170:47.78]Oh, fuck.
[171:23.35]Alright, run!
[171:30.41]Run!
[171:31.63]Run!
[171:39.28]Holy fucking moly, that does a lot of damage.
[171:45.50]Run!
[171:45.84]Run!
[171:47.14]Oy!
[172:16.74]Oh, come on.
[172:17.71]I figured maybe I'd try it off the horse.
[172:22.95]But it's way harder off the horse.
[172:37.26]It's not that bad.
[172:38.46]I got it done.
[172:40.53]I love how colorful the game is.
[172:42.25]The game is beautiful.
[172:56.59]Eternal darkness!
[172:58.35]Did that do anything?
[172:59.71]Did that catch his crazy beam thing?
[173:07.82]At one point.
[173:08.34]Thank God for getting it out of the way.
[173:14.86]We're going with the other strat.
[173:17.44]It's called the Kill'em strat.
[173:24.55]Take them all down.
[173:54.14]I didn't get away?
[174:12.37]Why make that a confirmation?
[174:15.09]Okay, FromSoftware.
[174:17.29]Listen to me.
[174:18.05]Listen to me very carefully, FromSoftware.
[174:19.59]Very carefully.
[174:21.58]If I am going to select... If I'm going to select that item and hit X... Why are you giving me a confirmation where I have to press another button to do it?
[174:38.23]Why are you... Why?
[174:38.99]Why?
[174:40.41]I have to select it on my inventory menu.
[174:44.48]Why can I not just do it?
[174:45.86]Why do I have to confirm that I want to do it and hit left on the fucking D-pad?
[175:13.75]It's the guy from The Simpsons!
[175:30.39]Who's the professor from The Simpsons?
[176:06.02]Come on!
[176:07.94]Come on Gwen!
[176:22.17]That fucking is so huge.
[176:33.40]Fuck you, dude.
[176:36.48]It's too big.
[176:42.44]That splash damage is fucking outrageous.
[176:57.18]Three times in a row!
[177:30.90]Fucking same boulder.
[177:32.86]Hold on.
[177:33.44]Hold on.
[177:33.92]Wait.
[177:34.48]I'm not ready to die.
[177:35.48]I'm not ready to die.
[177:37.14]I've walked into the same boulder three fucking times.
[177:40.62]I've ran into that fucking boulder.
[177:43.52]Come on.
[177:44.50]I'm not ready to die.
[177:45.70]I'm not ready to die yet.
[177:56.89]What's this?
[178:01.91]Oh, he lost his magical juice!
[178:03.17]Alright, I gotta kill him.
[178:11.37]No!
[178:11.69]You cannot run it.
[178:31.12]You cannot run it.
[178:34.32]So,
[179:13.47]I was frozen in fear.
[179:21.60]Use magic?
[179:23.14]It takes so long to cast.
[179:25.14]I'm off my horse.
[179:27.66]I could have switched to the thing, but I was so afraid to cast because I thought he was going to do that move where he fucking shoots the lightning at me.
[179:38.64]do I have alright but I this is it this is an in in okay listen this is an int scaling weapon I'm doing int and dex you understand you understand this isn't this is this people okay people think that I'm just like swinging with no stats
[180:21.57]I'll get it.
[180:21.99]I'll get it.
[180:22.33]I just froze in fucking fear.
[180:24.79]And holding Y and pressing R1 and then cycling through my spells to cast and stand still for two seconds is not something I was prepared to do falling off the horse with no flasks and he's got the lightning shit, okay?
[180:37.26]I wasn't prepared for it.
[181:19.27]Okay, you actually can't get away from that.
[181:20.47]Do you have to go forward?
[181:21.45]You might have to go forward.
[181:25.75]I wonder... Maybe to run forward.
[181:42.56]No.
[181:43.12]How do you get away from that?
[181:43.90]Do I just have to fight him off the horse in this phase?
[181:49.06]That's probably what I have to do.
[181:55.51]Because that almost seems bad to be on the horse.
[181:59.17]Oh my fucking body killed me in one hit.
[182:05.95]Can you jump?
[182:11.74]I don't know.
[182:12.12]It comes from the sky.
[182:19.35]Just jump off the horse when it happens and jump back on.
[182:23.93]That's going to get me killed, though.
[182:25.67]That's right.
[182:40.65]Really?
[182:42.25]That took so fucking long.
[182:50.35]The horse has iframes.
[182:52.01]Getting back on the horse, yeah.
[182:54.23]I'll get off the horse and get on the horse when he casts it, right?
[183:01.93]I feel like I'm doing the horse dash right when it happens and it still hits me.
[183:06.28]Like the horse dash only lasts as long to dodge like the first two because he goes like one, two, three, four.
[183:16.84]Yeah, I'll get off and get on.
[183:18.44]See if that works.
[183:58.36]Come on, bro.
[184:28.75]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[184:32.90]Oh, this is... Did I do it?
[184:38.70]I think it worked.
[184:48.21]No, shit.
[184:48.91]It's just so hard to be able to... That's weird, though.
[184:54.37]It's hard to cycle through that much.
[184:55.75]It's hard to know when he's going to do it.
[185:15.09]Okay, here we go.
[185:24.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[185:25.74]Do the thing.
[185:27.78]Wait, there was no iframe.
[185:29.56]What?
[185:31.28]When did the iframe start?
[185:32.82]When did the iframe start?
[185:39.53]Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge 65 hours into the game?
[185:55.45]You've seen me do it like a hundred times.
[186:01.58]You can't dodge them all.
[186:11.22]He's like, he's turning.
[186:12.92]Oh shit, he's turning.
[186:14.66]He just growled at us.
[186:25.11]He just turned and growled.
[186:26.71]Okay, I need to get my bearing.
[186:38.17]That was fucking funny.
[186:41.60]Okay, we're good.
[186:50.74]Okay.
[186:51.12]Okay.
[186:52.02]I'm gonna beat him.
[187:00.87]I can't, I'm laughing too hard.
[187:06.59]Dude, of course I know.
[187:08.25]The horse has to dodge.
[187:10.31]I pressed it probably 5,000 times in the course of the last two weeks.
[187:17.94]I'm gonna die.
[187:55.06]Okay.
[187:56.96]So.
[188:04.81]That was really funny.
[188:07.47]I would like to continue to play the game.
[188:10.03]That would be swell.
[188:16.55]Why would it just do this?
[188:17.85]This fucking guy can't even hurt me.
[188:21.28]What's happening?
[188:21.96]Why can I kill him like this?
[188:23.87]He didn't even hit me once.
[188:27.65]Alright, look.
[188:28.37]Dodge.
[188:29.70]It doesn't do anything.
[189:06.91]He's full of blood?
[189:08.25]Yeah, because I'm laughing my ass off.
[189:22.41]Don't listen to what anybody on the internet says.
[189:24.29]Just stay at his butt.
[189:25.77]And you won't get hit once.
[189:35.25]Just stay up his ass the whole game.
[190:07.38]It's so finicky.
[190:08.76]Do you see how finicky it is?
[190:15.37]FromSoftware.
[190:16.29]I want to FromSoftware.
[190:16.99]What I want to do is FromSoftware.
[190:18.77]Do I want to get all the wars?
[190:57.73]Thank you.
[191:26.68]that was fun what do you say when I said please for the love of god what
[191:52.54]Please, for the love of God, use glintstone pebbles.
[192:12.29]There better not be a dragon that lands on this bridge.
[192:14.36]Frum!
[192:14.64]Remember when you growled at us?
[192:33.39]I need to see it.
[192:34.85]I have to see it.
[192:40.02]I need to see it.
[192:51.83]Is this it?
[192:53.21]Hold on.
[192:54.15]We need to watch this.
[192:54.87]I need to examine this because I don't know what the fuck happened.
[193:06.77]Oh my fucking god, I look like a weirdo.
[193:19.28]Oh my god, dude.
[193:25.74]What?
[193:26.23]Why does it sound so weird?
[193:28.05]Why does it sound so weird?
[193:33.91]What's wrong with this?
[193:35.87]Why do I sound like a f- Is that what I sound like?
[193:44.54]Why do I sound like a fucking cave troll?
[193:48.88]Oh, I have an- Doesn't sound much better!
[194:03.60]He's like, he's turning.
[194:04.78]Oh shit, he's turning.
[194:07.02]He just growled at us.
[194:08.28]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[194:22.15]Somebody said, Tim the tool man.
[194:35.07]Honestly, man, when somebody asks you, when somebody says, hey, dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?
[194:40.09]It's like, bro.
[194:43.79]Yes.
[194:53.98]The fundamental part of the whole game.
[194:56.08]Oh.
[195:10.61]Alright.
[195:12.39]That was very funny.
[195:14.83]That was a very fun time.
[195:18.03]Let's take a second here.
[195:19.73]Let's take a second and relax.
[195:24.74]That was very fun.
[195:32.98]That's so fucking funny, though.
[195:35.66]You know, it's funny, like, you pick up... Let me give you some... Here's some streamer insight, okay?
[195:39.97]Okay.
[195:43.21]When the streamer's mad.
[195:44.93]Like very mad.
[195:45.97]And the streamer looks over.
[195:48.63]And sees.
[195:49.69]Just picks out the one comment.
[195:51.13]That's just like.
[195:51.94]Hey yo bro.
[195:53.52]Like maybe you should go back to fucking Mario Tennis.
[195:56.20]It's just like.
[195:56.70]You fucker.
[195:59.58]You motherfucker.
[196:02.12]Don't say that to me right now.
[196:03.71]I'm in the middle.
[196:04.33]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[196:15.27]You're the only person that does that?
[196:17.43]No.
[196:18.43]No way.
[196:30.37]That was fucking wild.
[196:32.15]Okay, that was fun.
[196:33.09]I'm glad you all enjoyed that.
[196:34.99]That was a good time.
[196:38.31]I want to see what's in this room.
[196:48.82]35 vigor.
[197:11.23]I'm not the most unhinged Elden Ring streamer, right?
[197:14.41]Like, I'm not.
[197:17.20]I can't be.
[197:18.58]There's thousands of streamers that are like crazy.
[197:21.18]Right?
[197:22.60]I'm not crazy.
[197:24.79]I can't be the craziest guy.
[197:29.09]Everybody growls at their audience.
[197:31.11]Right?
[197:32.21]And like turns purple.
[197:34.61]I turned purple.
[197:36.41]Has any streamer played Elden Ring and turned purple?
[197:40.43]Maybe I should stop playing.
[197:43.29]Maybe I should stop playing Elden Ring.
[197:49.93]Like, yo, dude, um, that's probably not healthy.
[197:51.97]To turn, like, a dark purple while you're sitting in your chair.
[197:58.86]You know, they probably got, you're probably right.
[198:04.26]Alright.
[198:08.44]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[198:24.47]Okay.
[198:28.73]You're turning into Grimace.
[198:32.71]So, was there anything else in this room?
[198:34.27]I'm in the castle now, which is cool, bro.
[198:41.10]My stomach hurts from laughing.
[198:43.28]I can't believe I actually growled at you.
[198:45.18]I, like, growled at you.
[198:47.78]That was, like, animalistic.
[198:49.22]Like, what was that?
[198:55.56]Oh my god.
[198:56.40]What a fucking weirdo.
[199:09.43]You growled at like 10 to 12 thousand people.
[199:11.53]Is this guy alive?
[199:18.53]I kind of feel- I feel bad for doing that.
[199:26.06]How come you're so shiny?
[199:28.08]Dude, if that's your actual question, if that's your question as to why I'm shiny, maybe it's the beads of sweat going down the crack of my ass right now.
[199:39.06]It could have something to do with that.
[199:44.78]I'm sure it has something to do with it.
[199:54.45]Another bonfire.
[199:55.19]Alright.
[199:58.61]We haven't heard from her in a while.
[199:59.77]My utmost thanks for bringing me to the base of the Erdtree.
[200:04.44]This is the base of the Erdtree.
[200:06.80]I can govern my own movement and thus the accord is fulfilled.
[200:13.84]I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given.
[200:18.65]Wait, so we had to bring her to the tree?
[200:20.33]I shall leave Torrent and the power to turn runes into strength.
[200:27.01]Why couldn't she just walk here?
[200:28.43]Why couldn't you just come here?
[200:29.17]Isn't this... I'm about to be maidenless.
[200:32.98]Yeah.
[200:33.14]Okay.
[200:33.28]Well, thanks for... Thanks for everything.
[200:34.58]I want to read this.
[200:56.74]Okay.
[200:59.18]Equipment load.
[201:01.72]What's the utilization on this?
[201:05.42]Drink that to get temp equipment load.
[201:06.98]Why would you... This seems weird.
[201:10.25]Drink that and then put on a greataxe or something?
[201:16.23]Briefly stop rune loss on death.
[201:18.23]What?
[201:18.57]Really?
[201:24.98]Really?
[201:27.32]That seems insane.
[201:29.26]So if you know you're gonna die, you just chug that and you don't lose your souls?
[201:36.22]That's like an oh shit button.
[201:40.40]I wonder how long it lasts.
[201:48.49]Enhanced charged attacks for a time.
[201:50.35]That's pretty good.
[201:55.03]It's 10 seconds.
[201:59.25]I wonder what it would pair with.
[202:00.21]Because you don't want to... You really want to do it with... That's like the I'm going to die button.
[202:17.12]I don't know.
[202:23.06]Maybe just the... Heal?
[202:26.89]Just in case?
[202:29.34]It's three minutes?
[202:33.08]Well, that changes everything.
[202:34.08]Okay.
[202:35.66]So why would... Yeah, just drink that right before you get into a boss room.
[202:39.32]I'm going to keep it like this.
[202:43.46]Very cool.
[202:51.61]So she's like, oh, I'm going to leave you now.
[202:52.97]Because now we're at the base of the Erdtree.
[202:55.21]Which is over here.
[203:03.64]Lyndell, royal capital.
[203:04.92]Alright.
[203:11.90]This is cool.
[203:16.99]Very cool.
[203:29.65]This is kind of creepy.
[203:53.50]These guys are terrible.
[203:54.34]I mean, you're really cool looking.
[203:57.82]Actually, I like these enemies a lot, but...
[204:06.18]What the fuck are you doing, man?
[204:07.48]Are they like crabs?
[204:11.72]White flesh.
[204:17.65]Whoa.
[204:18.57]Oh my god.
[204:21.85]Oh my god.
[204:37.52]Good move for here.
[204:40.76]Good move for here.
[204:41.67]Yeah.
[204:47.03]Oh, check the axe out.
[204:48.05]Yeah.
[204:53.75]Where is it?
[204:56.01]Gargoyle's Great Axe?
[204:59.49]No.
[204:59.79]Where is it?
[205:02.33]Dragon Claw.
[205:03.57]Dragon Great Claw.
[205:08.97]Hmm.
[205:10.43]Like a turkey bone.
[205:14.41]Wreath with lightning.
[205:18.14]Can I check it out?
[205:26.56]It's not faith weapon.
[205:27.42]It's just a strength weapon.
[205:37.94]That's pretty cool.
[205:41.14]Oh, I got a shield, too.
[205:41.98]You're right.
[205:45.26]This is a lightning shield.
[205:47.72]Imbued with lightning.
[205:48.72]Damn.
[205:55.78]Very cool.
[205:57.98]Exceptionally cool.
[205:58.84]I don't know what that thing is, but...
[206:20.17]I'm not going close to this guy.
[206:30.88]I have a lot of runes.
[206:41.96]Remember when you growled at us?
[206:43.40]I remember, trust me.
[206:52.04]I love inside of here.
[206:53.12]7k is not a lot.
[207:04.71]No, I mean these are what I'm talking about.
[207:07.13]I have quite a few of those.
[207:21.60]I wanna check this out.
[207:34.88]Envoy's horn?
[207:35.75]You can actually use one of these horns?
[207:41.29]Is this sorcery?
[207:47.83]No, it's a faith weapon.
[207:50.05]Oh, you can blow the bubbles too.
[207:51.65]That's so awesome.
[208:03.82]It doesn't work.
[208:06.92]No, stop.
[208:07.30]You're getting spin all in it.
[208:09.79]No, you're doing it wrong.
[208:11.43]Give me back.
[208:12.11]Oh, well.
[208:36.76]That was fucking awful.
[208:47.30]Yeah!
[208:49.36]Really?
[208:55.76]Don't do it.
[208:56.54]Don't do it.
[208:56.94]Please don't do it.
[208:57.92]I am begging you.
[209:05.52]Don't do it.
[209:05.88]I'm trying.
[209:06.31]I'm just trying.
[209:15.47]Bye.
[209:24.66]What's the chest piece?
[209:25.48]This chest piece is the mausoleum knight armor.
[209:30.06]It's pretty cool.
[209:32.73]It's pretty good.
[209:34.35]It's been very good so far.
[209:46.08]I do love these internal areas, though.
[209:47.46]They're awesome.
[209:49.20]Very pretty.
[209:50.00]Very cool.
[209:50.50]I like the kind of overgrowth.
[209:53.86]Looks interesting.
[209:57.04]Alright, so that wrapped all the way around.
[210:02.88]I guess we're just going to go that way.
[210:08.89]The growl.
[210:14.55]The growl incident.
[210:21.89]It went that way.
[210:22.49]Okay, let's go.
[210:44.37]Okay, uh, I'm gonna say let's go this way first.
[210:56.31]Somebody's behind me.
[210:59.01]Oh shit.
[211:13.44]Did you block that too?
[211:23.31]Oh!
[211:28.83]Yeah, that was greedy.
[211:39.73]Where's the nearest bonfire?
[211:48.33]Right here.
[211:48.77]Okay.
[212:01.99]Are you going to do Nintendogs?
[212:13.80]No, probably not.
[212:29.42]I do like the flail.
[212:31.12]It's starting to show that it's very good.
[212:42.81]I'm going to get it to plus 10.
[212:44.63]You bet your ass.
[212:51.94]Where's the lever?
[212:52.64]Oh.
[212:54.36]The weapon art is amazing.
[212:59.26]Alright, let's try that again.
[213:13.05]What?
[213:14.89]Is there something in the front door?
[213:15.89]These guys are alive, so let's change that.
[213:35.94]Bye.
[213:38.20]Okay, remind me that there's a ladder in this room, please.
[213:57.48]Hmm.
[214:10.50]I like this area a lot.
[214:21.63]Let me just check and see what's up here.
[214:34.61]Ooh, that was a pretty good hiding spot for this.
[214:39.41]perfume bottle I have like two or three of these This place looks like a Dream for people that like to jump around and parkour in random places I can already see a dozen different ways to go
[215:18.77]Look at the bubble on him.
[215:26.67]Alright.
[215:37.47]I'll get my souls.
[215:38.19]I'm just going to... There might be something right here.
[215:52.19]There's a ladder in that room.
[216:05.61]I just went up it.
[216:06.07]Don't make me growl.
[216:09.05]Don't make me growl again.
[216:12.41]Upper class robe.
[216:22.06]Bright green robe worn by noble children.
[216:23.74]Donning such a robe is traditionally the child's first show of burgeoning independence.
[216:30.38]There's a lot of magic defense.
[216:40.23]Why does this fit?
[216:47.92]I feel like this shouldn't fit.
[216:50.67]Ooh, wait a minute.
[216:51.41]Okay, what's this?
[216:56.63]Ah!
[216:56.79]This is where I was.
[216:57.89]This is where I fought that guy.
[216:59.39]Down here.
[217:02.37]Down there.
[217:03.01]Okay.
[217:06.62]Let's not make the same mistake twice.
[217:08.16]Okay.
[217:20.30]Good opener.
[217:21.74]What an opener.
[217:22.28]That move is so fucking good.
[217:31.81]Who cares about- Katana who?
[217:33.71]Katana who, huh?
[217:35.69]Katana who?
[217:49.02]So what's in here?
[217:52.03]That's not a door?
[217:55.73]Huh.
[217:56.91]That looks like a door.
[218:00.23]What is this?
[218:20.41]Don't get greedy!
[218:23.19]Look at this space.
[218:24.29]What the fuck am I doing?
[218:29.06]What's the range?
[218:31.00]What's the range, man?
[218:32.50]How far can he do that?
[218:38.56]He was far.
[218:39.24]I thought he couldn't go that far with that.
[218:43.53]Bullshit.
[218:49.18]It's just wherever you are.
[218:50.04]Alright.
[218:50.48]Well, let me get back.
[218:51.28]Get me back out there.
[218:53.58]God damn it.
[218:53.88]It's a far run.
[218:55.77]Like I'm close to a bonfire there.
[218:56.95]How late am I going?
[219:12.50]Probably another hour.
[219:21.04]And you just distracted me, which is gonna cost me all my souls.
[219:24.85]I want that person timed out.
[219:28.81]Yep.
[219:29.07]Don't fuck with the screamer again.
[219:30.93]I can just jump into there.
[219:47.29]Wait.
[219:47.51]Can I just jump?
[219:51.49]Is it safe for me to just jump to this and fall?
[219:53.25]I don't have to wait for the elevator.
[219:58.56]Okay, stop fucking this up.
[220:35.19]Okay.
[220:38.23]There's nothing else over here.
[220:39.19]There's a guy right here.
[220:45.42]Wondering why I killed that guy?
[220:46.60]In case I have to kite this guy out, I don't want to bump into that guy.
[220:58.72]Oh shit!
[221:10.47]Damn!
[221:11.51]Damn!
[221:30.25]Nooo!
[221:39.86]What the fuck?
[221:41.28]Hey, those guys are horrible.
[221:48.40]Those guys are nuts.
[221:52.48]Why do people keep saying better gamer chair?
[221:54.20]What's that mean?
[221:55.66]Better gamer chair, better gamer chair.
[221:57.44]Why are you saying that?
[222:04.54]What does it mean?
[222:07.56]Where's this?
[222:08.80]Okay.
[222:34.64]Is this down in this, like, weird lobby?
[223:14.34]It's, it's, it's he kills me or I kill him.
[223:16.26]It's alright, guys.
[223:21.02]I know, it was a beautiful flute song, but the beautiful flute song turns into a little fucking, like, shoe knife that he's like, and sticks it into my neck.
[223:37.75]Not these guys.
[223:38.41]Is he breaking through the wall?
[223:40.78]Is somebody coming through the wall?
[223:41.80]2500 damage.
[223:42.58]What a burst.
[223:54.48]Look at that burst damage.
[224:01.05]Ow.
[224:08.89]Damn, man.
[224:14.84]How much...
[224:23.08]Somebody else alive down here.
[224:24.38]Where are they?
[224:24.72]Yep.
[224:24.80]Alright.
[224:34.28]So what do you got?
[224:34.80]What do you hide in here?
[224:36.98]What's in here?
[224:43.35]Warming stone.
[224:46.89]End rune.
[225:02.67]Okay, there's a knight standing there.
[225:04.55]How many little corridors to go in?
[225:11.87]I don't know which one is the right one.
[225:12.95]There's so much to do.
[225:13.67]Oh, I killed him already.
[225:21.94]There's so much cool shit over here.
[225:29.98]Wait, this is just back out here.
[225:33.00]Remember, did you eat?
[225:34.58]I took a 20-minute, 25-minute break or so in the middle of this stream, and I had food.
[225:42.00]I ate.
[225:46.01]And... It was good.
[225:51.43]I'm good to go until the end of the stream.
[225:56.95]Okay.
[226:04.27]Alright, this guy's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[226:06.61]Does he see me already or no?
[226:07.62]Can I get behind him?
[226:18.40]Alright.
[226:34.41]Is it open from this side?
[226:37.41]What?
[226:37.65]Oh well.
[226:55.23]Alright, we're going right down Main Street here.
[226:56.79]I don't like this.
[226:58.41]Without a bonfire.
[227:03.64]I don't like this without some kind of bonfire to get to.
[227:06.61]Something's going to jump down here.
[227:09.25]Dude, I don't like this.
[227:15.81]I need a bonfire.
[227:19.67]I'm going back this way.
[227:26.98]Come on, right here.
[227:42.42]Is this a shortcut?
[227:47.06]Wait, this is the front door!
[227:47.98]I think this is the front door to get in.
[227:58.19]No, it's not.
[227:59.57]Why the fuck would I think that?
[228:17.79]Is there a bonfire?
[228:19.05]I just need a bonfire.
[228:20.45]That's all I need.
[228:25.26]Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[228:28.28]I will, I will.
[228:31.16]I'll turn around, don't worry.
[228:39.95]I thought that was a tank.
[228:43.87]I was like, why is this weird?
[228:45.49]Why would there be a World War II tank?
[228:51.61]That was kind of weird looking.
[228:58.42]Alright, so this is not the right way then.
[229:01.52]But... So I gotta go this way.
[229:09.36]But there's no bonfire.
[229:10.62]This dragon's going to come to life.
[229:12.41]It's going to break out of the stone and jump down and have two twin blades.
[229:15.95]And it's going to be awful.
[229:18.41]I could try going this way.
[229:20.85]Which is that's precisely what I'm going to do.
[229:29.88]I'm going to go the other way.
[229:42.30]This goes up.
[229:43.72]This goes down.
[229:49.52]Uh.
[230:15.42]Um, okay.
[230:44.66]Ooh, a bow.
[230:49.64]Can't make that jump.
[230:55.71]Fuck.
[231:07.12]There's a guy up there.
[231:16.24]I am BEGGING you.
[231:17.38]I don't know... Uh, I don't know what you're begging me.
[231:21.56]I missed it.
[231:22.46]I didn't see what you said.
[231:41.08]I'm BEGGING you.
[231:45.56]Ooh, nice.
[232:02.13]What's that?
[232:03.99]What's that?
[232:04.49]Okay, nothing.
[232:07.81]Nothing to be concerned with.
[232:15.33]That linger is such a long time, too.
[232:17.23]That move is so goddamn good.
[232:28.14]Alright, I can go down.
[232:42.13]I think this is the boss.
[232:53.29]Ah.
[232:56.53]No, no, no.
[232:56.99]I'm not ready.
[232:57.37]I'm not ready.
[232:57.75]I'm not ready.
[232:58.13]I'm not ready.
[232:58.57]I'm not ready.
[232:58.99]I'm not ready.
[233:00.67]I'm not ready.
[233:01.09]I'm not ready.
[233:01.49]Get in here.
[233:01.97]In here.
[233:02.21]I'm not ready.
[233:02.59]I'm not ready.
[233:10.19]Oh, shit.
[233:11.22]There's one of these guys.
[233:15.76]Oh, shit.
[233:16.58]Oh, shit.
[233:17.24]Oh, shit.
[233:17.66]Don't do it.
[233:20.36]You... Ah!
[233:23.14]The timings!
[233:24.40]I just was... He... I did not expect him to be in this room.
[233:31.39]He goes bang, bang, bang, bang.
[233:33.61]I didn't think he was going to do it more than twice or three times.
[233:35.81]He did it four times in a row.
[233:37.09]I have no idea where the fuck that is.
[233:45.89]Good luck finding that shit.
[233:48.63]It's in this labyrinth down here.
[233:50.61]I think I just jumped on the roof?
[233:57.97]We begged you.
[233:58.72]What are you begging me?
[234:10.58]Oh, please.
[234:17.52]Ahhhh!
[234:52.06]Ow, did you do that?
[235:01.27]Fine, fine, fine, fuck you.
[235:08.80]What is it?
[235:09.22]What?
[235:10.62]What is that?
[235:13.48]What?
[235:23.99]He was gonna just keep- he was gonna chase me through the whole goddamn labyrinth, and I- Ahem.
[235:43.74]I stopped running because this guy's not going to stop.
[235:46.84]He has a lightning move that if he has line of sight, he can just ping me with it if my back is turned.
[235:52.32]And I'm going to get hit by it, and it's going to be fucking infuriating.
[235:55.71]And then we got this random dickhead over here.
[235:57.35]Is this death?
[236:04.69]No.
[236:05.19]Okay.
[236:05.65]That's how you do it.
[236:31.80]Okay, so what now where am I at now?
[236:53.39]There's more shit over here.
[236:54.13]Okay, this is that kind of just main road.
[237:03.00]I went over there, that guy scared the shit out of me.
[237:06.52]I'm gonna go back over there and I'm gonna fight him.
[237:08.62]After I get these items.
[237:32.21]These are worth getting, man.
[237:33.21]This is like 10-20,000 runes each.
[237:36.87]Each.
[237:37.71]Easy.
[237:37.99]1,000 damage almost fully charged.
[237:50.18]Alright.
[237:54.94]So...
[237:59.97]That's that way.
[238:01.63]I'm going to just gently drop down here.
[238:06.37]Just check over here.
[238:07.67]Yeah, of course.
[238:08.63]There could be something down here.
[238:09.55]There is.
[238:09.93]There's a mushroom.
[238:15.80]What's up, boys?
[238:41.38]Whoa No, no, no lighting
[238:59.69]Thank God he's stuck in the tree.
[239:05.55]What the f- Fuck, dude!
[239:09.39]Wowie!
[239:13.83]Haaa!
[239:19.67]Jeez.
[239:22.31]Are you Leaf?
[239:48.04]Killed that guy already.
[239:48.86]I'm just making sure, you know.
[239:52.34]Lugary wall?
[239:52.96]Yup.
[240:00.61]Should've drank this thing.
[240:01.67]I keep forgetting I have it.
[240:11.82]Imp head.
[240:34.09]Faith.
[240:34.39]Gives two faith for putting it on.
[240:39.82]That's pretty cool.
[240:43.42]Alright.
[240:46.36]Now let me go to where that scary knight was.
[240:55.85]He was down here.
[240:57.59]Okay.
[240:57.89]Alright, here we go.
[241:01.11]Let's see if I can beat him.
[241:26.81]Can't backstab him?
[241:57.81]holy shit damn you damn you pile of it
[242:31.86]God damn.
[242:33.52]Wait, did I do a Stewie?
[242:37.82]Heroes rune five.
[242:39.20]That was fucking nuts.
[242:51.15]Okay, I have enough to level up probably three or four times.
[242:54.71]Is there anything else down here?
[243:05.73]What's this?
[243:13.75]Still going?
[243:15.49]Yeah.
[243:17.35]I'm in it for a little while longer.
[243:18.39]Shortcut, please.
[243:26.46]Oh my god, there's a door here.
[243:28.36]Oh, wow.
[243:29.16]Thank goodness.
[243:32.08]Just like the old days of Dark Souls.
[243:35.06]A skip that goes across the whole thing.
[243:39.38]Thank God.
[243:41.55]Alright.
[243:42.37]It's time to do some rune smashing.
[243:46.75]Abundance of runes.
[243:47.81]35,000 souls?
[243:52.19]Damn.
[243:53.15]Alright.
[243:55.60]I'm going to be able to level up probably twice.
[244:09.60]I need like a hundred and something thousand to level up two times.
[244:22.97]That should do it.
[244:28.36]What do I need?
[244:31.54]Okay.
[244:33.10]I think the play is just to get to...
[244:39.02]I think it's just to get to 40 vigor, get to the soft cap.
[244:44.90]And... Put a couple into endurance, I think.
[244:49.03]Okay, I'll just kill a few things.
[245:06.74]Soft cap is 60.
[245:09.89]I thought it was 40.
[245:13.57]I need 50 something thousand, whatever it is.
[245:23.16]Come here.
[245:33.19]Come here!
[245:34.53]Stop moving around so much!
[245:40.03]51, 4, 7, 8.
[245:40.79]Okay.
[245:41.17]I got enough.
[246:02.40]Let's go.
[246:04.64]Thank God I got that door.
[246:13.74]I didn't even know that existed either.
[246:14.84]Okay, let's go... 37 vigor.
[246:25.11]I want to get this to 40.
[246:29.17]And then I'll cap it 50 intelligence.
[246:41.26]What does soft cap mean?
[246:43.18]Soft cap means that for every point you put into it after the soft cap, you get less than you normally did all the way through 40 to 60, whatever it is.
[246:52.55]So if the soft cap is 60, that means after 60, at 61, you're getting a reduced amount per point you put in.
[247:05.52]So, they always tell you, you know, guides, Reddit, gamers, is to try to get to the soft cap and then get something else up and then, you know, pound out something past the soft cap into the hard cap.
[247:20.79]Hard cap's a 99, right?
[247:21.41]Alright, I'm going straight down here.
[247:33.01]I want to fight that Urtree avatar.
[247:34.39]It's right here.
[247:39.62]disappears out of nowhere all my souls
[247:57.28]Oh magic
[248:25.79]Ah!
[248:44.85]Thank you.
[249:08.63]Mario Odyssey build?
[249:09.99]What?
[249:17.29]Used to gain an enormous abundance of runes.
[249:22.04]Is that 100,000?
[249:22.22]It's probably 50.
[249:23.78]Hell yeah.
[249:30.18]50k right there.
[249:31.00]Hell yeah.
[249:37.39]I want that item.
[249:54.88]Ah, you're alive still.
[249:56.00]I don't think I don't see you over there.
[250:05.81]Alright.
[250:08.73]Okay, what happened here?
[250:10.97]Spinting stone, and then I want to get this.
[250:16.77]Holy grease.
[250:24.06]Please do your best, Mario Yahoo.
[250:28.68]No, I've been streaming for 10 hours, man.
[250:31.28]I ain't gonna get a Yahoo out of me right now.
[250:34.86]I'm sorry.
[250:37.24]I haven't had my chapstick.
[250:38.88]I've been licking my lips all day.
[250:59.79]Could you please make a sound effect?
[251:01.69]So we know that you're alright?
[251:02.73]Yeah.
[251:03.83]Hm! Mip!
[251:22.83]Mhm. Hmmmm.
[251:36.48]Alright, don't be greedy here, just, I can grab it and run, grab it and run, grab it and run.
[251:41.27]In fact, why not use sorcery?
[252:07.81]Alright.
[252:28.98]Tons of runes here.
[252:29.94]They really want you to level up, don't they?
[252:31.67]Holy shit.
[252:35.37]Can you run here from the beginning of the game?
[252:43.19]Can you just get here?
[252:45.19]Sorta?
[252:46.01]What if you just ran around and just didn't fight anything?
[252:47.76]Just picked up like 300,000 souls worth of runes.
[252:51.58]And then leveled up like 30 times and just... ...wept the floor with the whole game.
[252:56.96]Oh, you have to beat the horse guy.
[252:57.96]Yeah, never mind.
[252:58.96]That's not gonna happen.
[253:02.40]That's true.
[253:06.43]Alright, was that all that was up here?
[253:25.36]Yes.
[253:27.16]It was.
[253:30.10]Where am I?
[253:30.52]Where am I?
[253:30.90]Where am I?
[253:31.24]Where am I?
[253:31.60]Where am I?
[253:32.04]Where am I?
[253:32.60]Where am I?
[253:33.34]What happened?
[253:33.84]Where'd I go?
[253:38.01]Where did I just go?
[253:38.61]I went back to like the beginning.
[253:43.55]Okay.
[254:04.64]Don't do it.
[254:22.55]Oh.
[254:25.29]Oh.
[254:27.02]Oh, he Diagorod.
[254:27.76]Hell yeah.
[254:28.48]Fuck you.
[254:32.36]That's a bad.
[254:32.92]That's bad.
[254:33.72]That's very bad.
[254:53.81]Let me get it off.
[254:55.76]Oh.
[255:20.87]Ah, somebody's shooting a bow and arrow like a dick.
[255:48.78]Oh, wow, look at you in there.
[255:52.68]You're so fucking good.
[255:57.51]Weasley Coward.
[256:10.34]I see.
[256:20.78]Alright, we're in like the sewer?
[256:33.59]Kick the ladder down?
[256:35.23]Oh dear god.
[256:36.29]Uh... Fuck it.
[256:58.30]That still hurts.
[257:11.54]Alright.
[257:16.14]Wasn't as scary as he looked.
[257:20.15]Omen smirk mask?
[257:21.95]What was that?
[257:26.09]Whoa.
[257:28.11]Mask with long, hideously twisted horns worn by the omen killers increases strength.
[257:37.12]That is pretty ugly.
[257:43.38]Barret, I don't need strength.
[257:52.78]Alright, so what was that for?
[257:58.52]oh nice alright I can level up again lionel's helm lionel's armor who's lionel death bed dress who's lionel
[258:23.39]Worn by Lionel the Lionhearted.
[258:26.07]Wait, he was at the Rodan fight.
[258:47.59]That heavy load.
[258:55.03]Still heavy.
[258:55.51]I don't think I can... I don't have enough endurance to put any of this on.
[259:00.01]It's cool, though.
[259:00.51]I can put the gloves on.
[259:05.75]Sure, why not?
[259:11.98]I cannot put the gloves on.
[259:13.24]Never mind.
[259:13.58]Too heavy.
[259:16.88]Still fat rolling.
[259:21.12]What?
[259:21.24]Fine.
[259:28.53]What do I... What did I put on?
[259:30.59]Oh, it was the Godrick Soldier Greaves.
[259:32.09]Okay, there we go.
[259:43.88]Did you go to sleep?
[259:45.52]I have a feeling there's probably something right down here.
[259:47.82]I'll give it an attempt or two, and then we'll probably call it.
[259:54.63]Let's crush this.
[259:57.57]Damn.
[260:02.05]So many.
[260:05.51]I'm telling you, figure to 40.
[260:09.78]I think I can get there.
[260:10.98]20, 30, 30,000.
[260:12.26]Almost there.
[260:25.33]Alright, whatever.
[260:25.75]Okay, I rested here.
[260:27.17]That was pretty cool.
[260:35.55]Sewer.
[260:36.39]This guy's back.
[260:37.09]He's just a regular enemy.
[260:38.01]He's not scary.
[260:40.22]Go down.
[260:44.64]Dude, you're...
[260:52.38]Put on the dress.
[260:53.78]Um, I could look at it.
[260:54.88]I didn't even see what it did.
[261:00.13]That was a misclick.
[261:01.79]Are you in here?
[261:02.41]Really?
[261:04.23]Get out of here.
[261:05.25]You couldn't even fit through the fucking door.
[261:32.25]Don't even aggro him, just go.
[261:41.39]Alright.
[261:58.04]What are you hiding in here?
[262:04.51]I think you just cashed out all the runes.
[262:06.09]I know, it was stupid.
[262:16.45]Okay, here we go.
[262:17.01]Whatever it is.
[262:17.43]Wait, we're already working.
[262:23.99]Oh, it's this thing!
[262:26.94]It's this thing!
[262:27.96]Right, okay.
[262:28.92]Let's go.
[262:34.90]This is the rot one.
[263:16.95]Whoa!
[263:43.58]Oh!
[263:49.28]He's in a fucking wall!
[263:55.69]No!
[264:00.03]That's a different move.
[264:21.00]Oh, he got me.
[264:21.56]He got me in his mouth.
[264:22.74]No.
[264:24.08]Survive it.
[264:24.58]Survive it.
[264:24.96]Prove me wrong.
[264:41.30]Thank you.
[265:07.84]Jesus!
[265:09.44]Fuck you with this weird bendy neck!
[265:46.33]Hey!
[266:07.85]Yes!
[266:10.50]Okay, golden seed.
[266:22.92]That boss looks like beyond meat.
[266:25.22]Did you say that or did he make that up?
[266:26.88]Did somebody actually say that?
[266:35.30]Alright, so he dropped a golden seed.
[266:36.80]They're just throwing.
[266:37.60]This is just like the boss enemies are enemies that are regular enemies here.
[266:45.44]What's that?
[266:50.14]Pulsarated worm, yeah?
[266:53.16]I have fought that thing a couple of times before.
[266:59.46]Alright, so that's all that's over here.
[267:00.64]Unless I'm missing something, right?
[267:09.02]Anything else that he was guarding?
[267:10.08]No?
[267:22.25]Oh.
[267:25.48]Well, I'm gonna level up.
[267:29.80]Put the dress on.
[267:31.52]What do you want?
[267:38.63]Where is it?
[267:49.87]Slowly replenishes the HP of nearby allies.
[267:57.61]It heals?
[268:01.99]That's pretty cool.
[268:09.93]Alright.
[268:12.57]Now... Now where?
[268:15.33]Can't level up yet.
[268:27.28]Should I keep going down the street?
[268:30.58]Go down the main street.
[268:31.58]Okay.
[268:31.74]Uh... Where the hell was that?
[268:37.34]I went down to the sewer.
[268:41.99]My lord, not over fucking here.
[268:55.42]How did I get there?
[268:56.15]What's this?
[269:11.60]Oh, right.
[269:15.29]There's a bonfire.
[269:16.07]Let me just go sit at the bonfire and then come out and walk down the street.
[269:20.07]Do you feel okay?
[269:20.93]I feel alright.
[269:23.05]It's definitely getting close to... I'm probably going to call it soon here.
[269:25.87]It looks so red.
[269:31.65]Yeah, I know.
[269:33.65]Let me just go back.
[269:35.14]Why am I running?
[269:35.64]Do I have aggro?
[269:40.46]Why do I have aggro?
[269:45.66]Okay, so what bonfire is the best one?
[269:47.92]This one here?
[269:54.03]Yeah, I'm very red.
[269:57.99]Very sweaty.
[270:00.25]A little tired.
[270:00.89]One and a half hours.
[270:05.03]That's not too... I mean, that's long.
[270:06.92]Okay.
[270:09.26]Okay.
[270:14.04]I'm gonna go right down Main Street.
[270:16.38]I would imagine that within the next 20 minutes, we're probably gonna stop.
[270:19.10]You look dead.
[270:24.63]Yeah, I'll stop soon.
[270:25.59]Don't worry.
[270:26.57]I'm fine.
[270:26.93]Trust me.
[270:27.17]I'm fine.
[270:28.65]I would tell you if I wasn't.
[270:37.81]It's just an intense gamer session.
[270:43.06]Plus, I have a light here.
[270:44.04]This is like an orange light.
[270:45.72]So, it's making me look a little more red.
[270:49.55]Okay.
[270:50.89]So, you're saying go all the way down here.
[270:52.99]Straight through into this door.
[271:03.73]Yeah, I remember this.
[271:04.27]Okay.
[271:04.39]Let's see what we can do.
[271:10.37]I can go in there...
[271:14.62]Wait.
[271:14.78]I was going to say, is that a bonfire?
[271:19.78]It is.
[271:20.14]This would be handy if I knew who this was.
[271:28.59]So is it something down here?
[271:52.55]It's a dick move.
[272:01.42]Oh, that's a dick move and they got a guy back there shooting arrows.
[272:04.06]Of course they do.
[272:20.57]Asher of War, Thunderbolt.
[272:33.00]Okay, this is a new- this is a new place.
[272:34.80]This is a new zone almost.
[272:42.29]Is he looking this way?
[272:45.07]I think he is, yeah.
[272:46.79]No, he's not.
[273:01.82]Get the items, and if there's anything else down here, I'll take it.
[273:09.23]Oh my, whoops.
[273:11.25]Alright, we're going down here.
[273:31.46]Alright, I'm almost close to a level.
[273:38.81]And daggers.
[273:41.63]Herdsteel dagger.
[273:42.85]That's new.
[273:50.02]Where does this go?
[274:03.14]Int is broken.
[274:04.00]Colossal weapon damage on that.
[274:09.63]Oh, I just snuck behind everything.
[274:10.93]Whoa.
[274:14.87]Whoa.
[274:16.01]Hold on.
[274:23.57]Jesus.
[274:25.19]I guess I'm going to do this.
[274:36.74]This is massive.
[274:45.87]Material?
[274:46.63]Gravel stone?
[274:47.41]Somebody's shooting at me and I don't know from where.
[275:08.28]Can I make that?
[275:09.66]I can land here, yeah.
[275:13.04]Run arc.
[275:17.08]Shit.
[275:17.74]Okay.
[275:17.88]Okay.
[275:34.72]Be careful.
[275:35.20]I don't want to lose... I don't want to lose these, so I'm going to drink this.
[275:38.72]Take him off the edge.
[275:54.81]Gravelstone?
[275:58.46]Lyndell Knight Armor.
[276:01.98]Wow.
[276:04.32]Jeez.
[276:08.24]Whoa.
[276:13.50]This place is massive.
[276:15.64]This is huge.
[276:27.58]Wow.
[276:31.44]I'll take that.
[276:34.85]I can go down that way.
[276:36.47]There's another bonfire.
[276:40.49]Perfect.
[276:41.27]Exactly what I wanted.
[276:52.20]I need to literally sneeze on one thing.
[276:54.04]Do I have any?
[276:54.52]I don't want to use that.
[277:07.21]Alright, well that guy's scary, so we're gonna go over here first.
[277:16.18]Cane sword!
[277:17.04]Beloved sword of an aged knight, whose last quest was long behind him.
[277:29.25]Repurposed into a walking stick.
[277:35.81]Cool.
[277:37.39]Looks like um... I'm curious.
[277:41.77]How does it swing?
[277:51.00]It looks like a Minecraft sword.
[277:56.12]This looks like it wouldn't hurt very much.
[278:06.02]like a fire poker this doesn't really look that dangerous it's cool though alright this looks interesting whatever it is okay this is actually perfect
[278:32.74]I'm going to level up.
[278:33.34]I'm going to see if there's a boss right here.
[278:35.02]If there is no boss right here within 30 seconds of this bonfire, I'm going to call it.
[278:40.24]What is this?
[278:45.01]Pull lever.
[278:56.19]Did that open this door?
[278:57.11]Did that open the gate underneath me?
[279:09.53]Oh shit.
[279:10.71]That's definitely a boss.
[279:12.69]Yeah, without a doubt.
[279:13.52]Let's go see who it is.
[279:14.12]I have to level up first.
[279:42.86]Let's just see if it is.
[279:43.81]I'm going to check right now.
[279:44.71]Hopefully don't kill me.
[279:54.35]Alright, so what's down here?
[280:06.22]Dude, this is a boss.
[280:08.22]This is a boss, dude.
[280:16.18]Who the hell am I?
[280:22.14]Ooh, Alberich's pointed hat?
[280:29.47]How do those people die?
[280:38.12]Strengthens thorn sorcery.
[280:43.38]That robe looks awesome.
[280:44.76]Where is it?
[280:48.48]Yeah, look at this.
[280:53.78]That looks cool.
[280:56.44]That looks cool, but not for me.
[280:57.92]At least not right now.
[280:59.82]This is the guy from the round table, the basement of the round table.
[281:10.83]Oh.
[281:14.61]Is this the round table?
[281:23.27]This looks like the round table.
[281:29.07]Wait, but if this is the round table, then where the hell have we been teleporting to?
[281:36.67]Painting.
[281:38.24]Table of Lost Grace.
[281:48.46]I don't get it.
[281:51.40]Like the Hunter's Dream?
[281:59.43]Interesting.
[282:04.27]It's the real one.
[282:12.18]Alright.
[282:13.46]I'm out of gas.
[282:22.64]This is a whole nother ton of explanation.
[282:27.50]Explanation?
[282:28.12]Exploration is what I meant to say.
[282:31.10]But I will get the items because they're right here.
[282:32.56]Two Fingers prayer book.
[282:40.10]I scared the shit out of myself.
[282:41.12]I heard something skittering around.
[282:42.24]Okay.
[283:00.68]Oh yeah, this is the round table.
[283:04.32]That's cool.
[283:05.82]Alright, as much as I want to keep going, after turning purple at that upgraded Tree Sentinel, I think it's time to stop.
[283:22.14]That was really cool.
[283:25.98]Is there a boss that's right here that I can see?
[283:31.06]Like, right here.
[283:33.52]I feel like I'm really close.
[283:35.92]I just want to see it.
[283:42.30]Right here?
[283:42.62]There's a dog.
[284:08.38]Keep going.
[284:19.82]And this is fucking crazy.
[284:28.24]I'll explore this better next time.
[284:36.89]All the way?
[284:42.70]How am I- STUPID!
[285:04.31]I can- Alright, I'm gonna explore this later.
[285:06.09]I just wanna see the boss.
[285:11.83]Is there a bonfire like right here?
[285:13.03]There probably is.
[285:27.80]Bod Free, the first Elden Lord.
[285:37.84]Why is he a shade?
[285:49.02]Oh, you got some fucking moves, don't you, Godfruit?
[286:30.59]Oh my god, he's so susceptible to that move!
[286:33.23]Wow!
[286:35.07]That did 1100 fucking damage.
[287:08.10]Jesus Christ!
[287:09.84]I'm burning through all my shit!
[287:21.96]Oh!
[287:48.06]I got it.
[287:48.42]I got it.
[287:48.84]I got it.
[287:49.08]I'm going to beat him.
[287:49.52]I'm going to beat him.
[287:50.44]I'm going to beat him.
[287:52.52]His timings are not that hard.
[287:53.92]I got it.
[287:54.26]I got it.
[287:54.56]I got it right here.
[288:01.84]I got it.
[288:02.26]I got it.
[288:02.64]Don't worry.
[288:03.08]I got it.
[288:03.46]I got it.
[288:03.70]I'm going to get him.
[288:09.21]What?
[288:09.83]Oh, okay.
[288:10.31]Right.
[288:10.45]Alright.
[288:13.51]Let's go.
[288:13.83]Let's go.
[288:14.07]Let's go.
[288:14.45]I got it.
[288:14.77]I got it.
[288:15.05]I got it.
[288:15.25]Just dodge.
[288:15.59]That's it.
[288:16.15]Just dodge him.
[288:29.47]Thank you for watching.
[289:00.44]Blocked it.
[289:50.59]Fuck you, I'll do it!
[289:55.77]And I'll do it again!
[289:57.97]That was a mistake.
[290:19.66]Ooh!
[290:21.32]The Baby Rattle's the best weapon in the game!
[290:38.37]80 fucking thousand ruins.
[290:39.37]Holy shit.
[290:50.42]Do the next boss?
[290:51.46]This one right here?
[290:52.60]Are you serious?
[291:03.27]New talisman slot, too.
[291:05.03]Oh my god.
[291:05.79]That's actually... This is going to take me a while to figure that out.
[291:13.04]Alright, I gotta... I'll just see what the boss... I'll just look at the boss.
[291:16.66]I'm just gonna look at the boss.
[291:17.52]I don't know what you wanna do.
[291:36.97]Maybe just, like, the... FP?
[291:38.79]I'll put it on for now.
[291:42.93]Alright, so you're saying that there's another boss?
[291:48.06]On the HP one.
[291:48.70]I... I don't want to lose these runes, though.
[291:52.78]This is a lot of runes to lose.
[291:59.18]What do I need to level up?
[292:01.80]56.
[292:07.11]Hold on.
[292:07.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[292:08.89]I'm almost there.
[292:12.87]Oh, I can use the flask.
[292:14.13]That's right.
[292:14.61]Okay.
[292:16.69]I forgot about the flask.
[292:18.71]Alright, so just check out the boss.
[292:21.55]We rest here.
[292:22.11]And you're saying there's just another one right here.
[292:30.23]This is actually it, though.
[292:31.41]Like, I'm just going to literally walk in and just fight it for five seconds.
[292:36.46]Just up the branch.
[292:43.76]Up those stairs.
[292:47.46]Wait, like go up that branch?
[292:54.72]Wait, there's an item over here.
[292:55.52]Come on.
[293:08.07]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[293:09.59]So he's saying there's a boss up here.
[293:12.33]That's pretty crazy that this back-to-back boss is.
[293:17.48]Where's he at?
[293:19.02]Just here?
[293:19.48]Okay, yeah.
[293:33.66]This definitely is boss.
[293:34.74]Alright, I'm going to drink the thing.
[293:43.61]Ah!
[294:10.17]We both have the same idea!
[294:25.78]Go to bed!
[294:26.24]Is that it?
[294:29.09]More?
[294:29.35]That's a pre-boss?
[294:34.67]What about my flask?
[294:35.25]Is my flask still active?
[294:51.21]That was the, that was a pre-boss.
[294:53.96]Is it, is it actually a boss?
[294:55.16]Are you guys bugging me?
[295:02.12]Bossing of the Erdtree.
[295:03.37]Damn.
[295:08.35]Oh, that actually is.
[295:10.97]Okay.
[295:11.47]Alright.
[295:12.09]So that was a pre-boss.
[295:21.95]Alright, drink the flask.
[295:24.67]What's in here?
[295:25.47]This is the base of the fucking Erdtree.
[295:43.01]Graceless tarnish.
[295:47.03]Is it Margit again?
[295:48.87]Margit for a third time?
[295:50.07]He's like Kael'thas at this point.
[295:58.15]Ah, Godrick the Golden.
[296:05.25]The twin prodigies, Mikkala.
[296:15.05]General Radan.
[296:16.63]The clones.
[296:18.23]Praetor Rykard.
[296:22.22]Lunar Princess Ranni.
[296:25.70]We haven't seen half of these people yet.
[296:29.24]Willful traitors.
[296:31.74]All.
[296:35.03]Is my drink running out, by the way, in this cutscene?
[296:38.41]Thy kind are all of a piece.
[296:44.47]I hope not.
[296:44.87]Alright, Margit.
[296:48.95]Pillagers emboldened by the flame of ambition.
[296:55.03]Oh, now it's actual war.
[296:59.27]Have it writ upon thy meager grave.
[297:01.95]What's this guy's problem?
[297:07.11]Nailed by King Morgott, last of all kings.
[297:18.24]What's his name?
[297:20.28]Morgott?
[298:02.19]so so so
[298:55.83]Oh, fuck you.
[298:57.03]It's gonna hurt.
[298:57.47]Oh.
[300:03.43]Oh, man!
[300:06.35]Oh, fuck!
[300:06.91]I thought I had it.
[300:07.53]I'm just too tired.
[300:09.67]Oh, I'm just too tired.
[300:12.02]When we got down to, like, the last 40%, I just was like, fuck, man.
[300:15.58]It was, like, colors.
[300:18.08]Ugh.
[300:19.52]Damn it.
[300:21.78]Ugh.
[300:23.66]If I had a little bit more matcha powder in my vape.
[300:28.95]One more try.
[300:30.77]One more try.
[300:31.35]Ugh.
[300:37.29]I thought I had it, too.
[300:38.41]Damn it.
[300:40.03]Ugh.
[300:41.79]Oh, I'm too tired.
[300:44.39]Why can't it be like hour number 3 instead of hour number 11?
[300:47.09]Alright, let's go.
[301:13.23]Oh, I thought I dodged it.
[301:16.01]Oh, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.
[301:19.65]Damn.
[301:21.67]Oh, I was so close on the first try.
[301:24.10]I almost did it.
[301:24.94]I was going to be such a fucking gamer.
[301:26.54]I was going to be such a gamer.
[301:31.52]I was going to be best gamer moment in 2022.
[301:42.17]Alright, actual final try, I promise.
[301:44.07]If I don't, it doesn't matter.
[301:45.77]Actual final try, I promise.
[301:49.07]Use your summons?
[301:52.02]Ah, I don't really have anything.
[301:53.14]I was so close.
[302:07.02]I thought I did it.
[302:08.28]I didn't do it, mom.
[302:09.20]Sorry.
[302:09.84]Sorry.
[302:17.11]Alright, let's get him Oh Double
[302:38.40]Oh my god, we're kicking the shit out of them!
[303:13.01]What the fuck?
[303:13.81]Oh my god, why would I do this the first time?
[303:36.11]Jump him.
[303:36.45]Not yet, not yet, not yet.
[303:41.29]Get him!
[303:42.60]Oh my god, that was so easy.
[303:44.24]That was so easy with the summon.
[303:48.52]What?
[303:54.15]That was so fucking simple with the summon.
[303:57.13]We just beat the shit out of him.
[303:58.65]We just comboed him.
[304:10.40]The mimic got the last hit?
[304:11.91]What the fuck?
[304:14.75]That was so intense and so hard and so ridiculous.
[304:17.59]I just rang a bell and a guy came... and fucking kicked the shit out of him.
[304:30.76]Okay.
[304:32.08]Alright.
[304:33.94]That was really cool.
[304:35.82]Uh...
[304:38.73]Mimic is fucking unbelievable.
[304:40.73]Are you fucking kidding me?
[304:45.19]That was insane.
[304:46.21]Alright, well I almost beat him first try.
[304:54.75]And then I rang the bell and somebody else came in and beat him for me.
[304:56.75]Alright, that's actually the end of the fucking stream.
[305:00.14]I'm done.
[305:01.12]That was nuts.
[305:10.33]We are, we are all forsaken.
[305:21.19]None may claim the title of Elden Lord.
[305:27.68]Thy deeds shall be met with failure, just as I.
[305:38.99]Alright, so you tried to be Elden Lord and didn't work.
[305:41.07]Alright, he's dead.
[305:46.74]Alright, so you tried to be Elden Lord.
[305:48.16]That didn't do anything.
[305:48.80]There's another boss behind the door.
[305:52.04]Check it out.
[305:52.80]No.
[305:53.68]No, no, no.
[305:54.00]I'm out of here.
[305:56.14]I can't leave.
[305:56.58]Why can't I leave?
[306:13.97]This is not a... Okay, this is not a boss back behind here, right?
[306:21.61]Impenetrable thorns refuse all.
[306:23.01]None may enter the Erdtree.
[306:29.27]I can't go in the Erdtree?
[306:37.54]Why not?
[306:40.60]I'll level up, alright.
[306:42.93]That was crazy.
[306:45.21]I'm so glad I had a mirror of myself to come in and fucking help.
[306:49.22]What are you doing here?
[306:59.51]I'm telling you right now.
[307:29.38]You're having trouble with this game?
[307:30.80]I'll get the mimic.
[307:34.02]Burn the Erdtree?
[307:35.48]Down the path.
[307:58.26]I don't trust a word this... I don't trust anything this lady's saying.
[308:00.34]A red mark was made on the map.
[308:08.79]Okay, so now we're gonna do... 50 intelligence.
[308:10.93]That's what I want.
[308:28.21]Oh, where is it on the map?
[308:29.17]I'm curious.
[308:31.13]So it is another area.
[308:32.17]Alright.
[308:36.22]That's it.
[308:37.18]That's it.
[308:37.50]I'm going to bed.
[308:39.74]But honest to god, if you're having a lot of trouble with this game and you're like, dude, I can't fucking do it.
[308:43.80]I just can't do it.
[308:45.89]If you've been hitting your head against a wall just going, I keep losing this guy a hundred times, I actually can't play the game.
[308:52.02]I actually can't do it.
[308:53.94]That mimic really made that fight very, very manageable.
[308:58.90]I wouldn't say the word is easy, but manageable.
[309:06.88]I am going to try to beat most of the encounters in this game without that, because I feel like that was...
[309:14.32]I did not think it was going to do that much damage.
[309:18.16]I really did not think that was going to be that ridiculous.
[309:24.75]That's the first time I've used that item.
[309:26.99]I leveled it up like five or six times.
[309:28.89]Wait, seven times maybe?
[309:30.01]That's the first time I've used it as a boss.
[309:34.02]And just watched him kill the boss.
[309:37.62]That was ridiculous.
[309:41.47]Mimic is really OP.
[309:42.45]It makes every single boss that easy.
[309:44.37]Really.
[309:44.91]Damn.
[309:46.71]But I mean, but seriously though, like if you, if you're having like a lot of trouble and you just kind of, you really want to be able to progress and you really want to go level up, go get the mimic, that'll help you.
[309:56.63]It will.
[309:58.23]Um, I probably won't be using it for the remainder of the time that I play the game.
[310:04.65]Not that I, not that I'm looking down on it or anything.
[310:07.05]I just, I, I thought, I almost beat that guy first try.
[310:13.22]So I'm only going to use it if I really need it.
[310:16.22]Really, really, really need it.
[310:21.60]Not every boss.
[310:22.50]Some are fucking insane.
[310:23.75]Yeah.
[310:25.81]Again, I'm not looking down on using the item.
[310:29.89]If I can do it without it, I'm going to try to do it without it.
[310:35.87]You'll be using it on Commander Neal.
[310:42.18]Well, good to know.
[310:45.17]Uh, alright.
[310:46.37]Same with the katana?
[310:48.70]No, I mean, like, everything is viable.
[310:51.75]Don't let anybody tell you you can't use a certain item.
[310:53.87]If you're having fun and you're playing through the game, then use it.
[310:57.57]There's no reason not to, right?
[311:00.27]I think the most fun I've had in the game so far... I think I can give this an assessment, a real review of sorts.
[311:06.65]The most fun I've had in the game has not been at the boss fights, like the main story fights.
[311:13.72]It's been exploring the world.
[311:15.28]It's been finding a dungeon.
[311:16.28]It's been getting killed somewhere in a spot that you're like, holy shit, where even am I?
[311:21.74]I love the areas.
[311:22.67]I love the actual huge open world.
[311:25.39]As hard as it is and as crazy as it's been, right?
[311:28.53]I actually like that more than the actual boss fights.
[311:32.23]So... But yeah, I'm going to try to beat stuff on my own.
[311:35.19]I'm going to try to beat it without using too many of the powerful summons or anything.
[311:41.43]We'll see if I can do it.
[311:45.48]But yeah, that was ridiculous.
[311:47.92]I'm glad I at least got to kill it.
[311:50.40]And I will see you guys.
[311:51.36]The next stream is going to be, well, interestingly enough, it will be Saturday.
[311:58.12]Although I will not be streaming.
[312:00.66]I am going to be at the Streamer Awards.
[312:03.67]You're probably going to see me.
[312:04.81]I'm going to be presenting one of the awards.
[312:07.35]Hopefully I look okay in a suit.
[312:08.83]Hopefully I look alright.
[312:11.79]It's going to be fun.
[312:12.95]Looking forward to it.
[312:16.09]Channel's nominated for two awards.
[312:20.09]We'll see what happens.
[312:20.75]I mean, that'd be cool, but there's tons of great nominees, so it's very, very competitive from what I would assume.
[312:29.56]Very good nominees.
[312:36.47]You're handsome.
[312:37.15]Hey!
[312:37.85]Thank you.
[312:42.19]Yeah, I'm gonna do all the side stuff too, or at least a lot of it.
[312:44.41]So I will be back on my channel on the 14th or the 15th.
[312:50.29]Keep an eye on the sus, either that Monday or Tuesday.
[312:52.50]Trying to figure out when I will actually be around to stream.
[312:58.88]Sorry for turning out purple, although that was probably very funny.
[313:04.32]I hope you got a laugh.
[313:09.09]Don't growl again.
[313:09.93]I won't.
[313:11.03]I promise.
[313:12.39]Alright.
[313:12.85]I'm going to let the credits play out.
[313:17.86]Oh, that's right.
[313:18.26]I put that in there.
[313:18.78]Okay.
[313:18.94]I'm going to save the game.
[313:20.70]I'm going to be right here.
[313:21.60]Thanks so much for watching, guys.
[313:23.28]This was a long one.
[313:24.24]I planned for it to be long because I knew that I wasn't going to be around for like six days probably.
[313:29.02]And I've been trying to stream this game a lot because I think it's great.
[313:31.42]I think it's amazing.
[313:34.89]I will see you guys later.
[313:35.73]If you're going to watch Streamer Awards, go ahead and watch it.
[313:37.71]It'll be on Cutie Cinderella's channel.
[313:42.21]Have a fantastic evening, of course.
[313:44.14]Rest of your night.
[313:44.58]I'm going to get some sleep.
[313:45.90]I got a lot to do tomorrow.
[313:52.42]Yeah, and I'm going to let this play out.
[314:04.69]I didn't mean for that to play us out, but it did.
[314:06.96]Is this the longest stream?
[314:13.55]No, my longest stream I think was 14 hours of Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers.
[314:33.50]Mold of the Rings.
[314:48.15]Simpsons was closed.
[314:48.89]Simpsons, I think, was 12.
[314:49.97]12 and a half, 13.
[314:54.83]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[314:55.89]Thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[314:56.99]I haven't really been paying too much attention to anything that's coming through.
[315:05.46]My brain's been focused pretty much the whole time.
[315:10.80]So what is... Let me ask you this.
[315:12.90]Those of you that have finished the game.
[315:15.66]What remains if... Okay, let's say I were to walk down the main story campaign hallway.
[315:22.95]And you just go down the main story campaign.
[315:27.49]How much is left?
[315:30.43]What do you say?
[315:37.01]Probably around somewhere around 80% done.
[315:38.75]Okay.
[315:39.21]Maybe like two or three streams.
[315:42.61]There's another map.
[315:44.49]There's another... Yeah.
[315:47.97]God.
[315:48.45]This game is so big.
[315:49.80]Probably about 15 to 20 hours.
[315:55.72]Okay.
[315:57.68]So I'll do it.
[315:58.66]I'll finish it on stream.
[316:01.57]At least I'll try to.
[316:10.98]There's still four main bosses remaining.
[316:13.74]Really?
[316:16.16]I was thinking two.
[316:23.53]Alright, goodnight guys.
[316:24.81]I'll see you later.
[316:26.29]Catch me on the stream of rewards.
[316:27.43]Have a great evening.
[316:28.15]Have a great weekend.
[316:28.84]Take care of yourselves.
[316:31.74]And goodnight.
[316:40.78]Thank you.
