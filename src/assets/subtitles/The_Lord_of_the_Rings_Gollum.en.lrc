[00:26.55]Hey, what's up?
[00:30.68]It's been 90 seconds.
[00:33.22]It's only been 90 seconds.
[00:39.06]Confirm what kind of bug you'd be.
[00:41.32]I don't know.
[00:52.53]What bug would I be?
[00:53.51]I would probably be a...
[00:57.74]Yeah, I don't think it'd be a beetle.
[01:03.05]No, no, no, no.
[01:05.13]I would be... A... Big ant.
[01:17.78]Yeah.
[01:19.44]One of the big ones, too.
[01:25.62]No, dude, you'd be lice.
[01:29.29]I, I don't think I, I don't think I'd be lice.
[01:32.97]I think you're not giving me, but hi.
[01:34.53]Hello.
[01:34.93]How are you doing?
[01:35.43]It's been a while.
[01:37.08]I've been a very busy boy, but it's good to see you again.
[01:50.76]You'd be a grasshopper.
[01:56.30]Hmm.
[01:57.56]I don't think I can move that quickly.
[02:01.06]No, I think big ant is a good one.
[02:05.44]He'd be a cockroach.
[02:06.38]Nah.
[02:06.64]I don't know.
[02:09.21]Maybe like one of the... I don't know.
[02:10.05]Maybe a beetle.
[02:10.39]Alright.
[02:12.31]Who gives a shit?
[02:12.99]Hi.
[02:13.69]Welcome.
[02:14.09]We're going to be playing Gollum today.
[02:16.21]We're going to be playing Gollum with a twist.
[02:18.74]Okay.
[02:18.92]Okay.
[02:20.90]I've heard this game is pretty bad, but I did say that I wanted to play it.
[02:28.25]I made a very, very important point a week or two ago when I knew this was coming out.
[02:33.49]It's like, I have to play this.
[02:35.03]How could I not play this game?
[02:38.37]So, I'm going to give myself a 1 hour and 55 minute timer to get as far as I can in the game as fast as I can.
[02:52.66]I'm going for a speedrun.
[02:54.84]I'm gonna see if I can speedrun the Lord of the Rings Gollum.
[03:02.54]Do you think I can do it in two hours?
[03:08.12]What do you think?
[03:11.24]No.
[03:11.86]No, not even close.
[03:12.98]No, that's fucked up.
[03:14.00]You don't think I can do it in three hours?
[03:15.12]What about three hours?
[03:16.59]He wants to refund it.
[03:22.96]I'm just saying, how far can I get in two hours?
[03:28.60]I was curious how far I could get in exactly one hour and 55 minutes.
[03:34.90]The game is like 10 hours long?
[03:38.96]What?
[03:41.08]Is it actually?
[03:42.00]Oh, shit.
[03:42.66]Well, let's see how we get in a couple hours.
[03:46.10]We'll see.
[03:47.48]I have to play it.
[03:48.38]Look, even if we're going to play it for like an hour, I don't even care.
[03:53.10]We're also going to play Street Fighter 6 at some point in the next hour or two.
[03:59.65]I want to play that single player mode.
[04:03.29]I'm doing the single player Andy on Street Fighter 6.
[04:05.79]Because that open world seems really, really fun to me.
[04:14.14]So we're going to play that.
[04:21.96]You're way too old for this game?
[04:23.80]Wait, you're saying I'm too old for Street Fighter 6?
[04:28.16]Why?
[04:29.90]What do you mean I'm too old for that game?
[04:34.18]Alright, well, anyways, I do have a... You might hear a fan in the background.
[04:42.23]It's really hot outside.
[04:44.70]It's like a million degrees right now, so you probably hear a fan in the background.
[04:47.54]That's the way it is.
[04:48.77]If it gets too distracting, I'll turn it up even higher to get rid of a bunch of you.
[04:53.61]Okay.
[04:58.22]A million.
[04:59.94]We can't hear the fan.
[05:01.02]Oh, nice.
[05:01.48]That means my...
[05:05.19]Alright, well, are you ready for- I- and look, I know people want a facecam, but I'm sorry.
[05:08.77]I'm sorry you're not gonna get it immediately.
[05:11.99]I don't know, maybe you will later.
[05:13.21]I don't know.
[05:13.61]We're just gonna play Lord of the Rings Gollum.
[05:17.47]Alright, I am opening it, which means I have to start the timer.
[05:21.31]I have a 1 hour and 55 minute timer here.
[05:23.08]I just wanna see how far I can get.
[05:25.22]It- we don't even have to follow it, I just wanna know how far.
[05:29.88]Okay, you ready?
[05:35.81]Self winning.
[05:38.39]Okay.
[05:41.07]Almost there.
[05:42.97]Okay.
[05:45.87]Okay.
[05:46.33]Can you see it?
[05:50.40]Why can I not hear anything?
[06:10.76]Why is the game quiet?
[06:14.09]You're gonna waste time sitting around idle?
[06:16.89]I don't think so.
[06:20.47]Now I can hear it.
[06:21.29]There it is.
[06:23.89]I can't waste any time.
[06:24.71]I actually have to start right now.
[06:26.82]I have to start right now.
[06:28.50]I don't know.
[06:28.78]Whatever's happening, I gotta go right now.
[06:32.64]I'm gonna speedrun this game.
[06:34.04]Clock is ticking.
[06:34.64]Let's go.
[06:42.48]Alright, let's turn the timer off for now.
[06:43.84]Well, not off, but get out of the way.
[06:45.22]Without me, eyes are marbles.
[06:49.33]No darkness they see.
[06:51.67]Skip?
[06:52.77]No, I want to see what happens.
[06:55.33]No flurry they feel.
[06:59.24]I have to see what happens.
[07:03.08]You're wasting time.
[07:03.94]Am I?
[07:04.14]Time lost, time lost.
[07:24.60]Lilies.
[07:26.78]What if I don't know where to go?
[07:27.72]Not roses.
[07:29.26]Which one was it, precious?
[07:34.01]I am wasting precious minutes, you're right.
[07:35.49]Okay, no, we're good, we're good.
[07:36.71]It's gonna be a bad split.
[07:37.89]No, we're fine.
[07:41.87]Quiet.
[07:42.85]Someone's coming.
[07:44.71]We may provide you with a car.
[07:52.09]Do you get a sword in this game?
[07:53.59]Do you get to actually use a two-handed sword as Gollum and just like start slashing people?
[08:00.69]Well, let's see how he responds to some light.
[08:07.39]Oh, that's Gandalf!
[08:09.09]Where is he?
[08:09.49]Where's that fool?
[08:10.19]Someone tortured him long before the DÃºnedain found him.
[08:14.83]The darkness grows beyond our borders.
[08:17.57]My people are growing anxious.
[08:19.93]We cannot let this evil linger among us, Gandalf.
[08:25.39]We believe that he went to Mordor.
[08:29.57]That's what I feared.
[08:32.84]Where does this take place in the timeline?
[08:34.42]Believe us, I want to hear what he has to say.
[08:42.99]This is too bright.
[08:46.69]Alright, there we go.
[08:55.58]We got plenty of time.
[09:01.50]Why don't we start with your name?
[09:06.05]Your real name, not the one others have given you.
[09:09.71]I don't have to actually put a name in, do I?
[09:12.17]It's not a what is your name RPG segment right now, is there?
[09:15.37]I kind of hope there is very well.
[09:19.38]Let us try someone else's name.
[09:22.13]Oh, it really is.
[09:23.05]Bilbo Baggins.
[09:26.57]Yes, you remember him.
[09:31.92]He found you more than 60 years ago.
[09:35.92]Oh, that's when it takes place.
[09:36.78]Deep underneath the roots of the Misty Mountains.
[09:43.63]He took something from you.
[09:48.83]a ring following the books of J.R.R.
[09:55.06]Tolkien you were looking for it weren't you following the book you left your home in the mountains
[10:11.78]Worming your way down the hills, always hiding from the moon.
[10:17.68]You follow the hobbit's trail all the way east to the lonely mountain.
[10:25.21]But then you stop and turn south.
[10:28.91]Why?
[10:33.56]Something must have drawn you away.
[10:38.34]A voice calling you to the land of shadow.
[10:41.48]Leave us alone.
[10:43.18]Whispering your name in your dreams.
[10:46.24]Not listening.
[10:50.15]The Lord of the Rings.
[10:52.33]Gollum.
[10:55.19]The adventure that absolutely no one asked for.
[10:58.99]So once again.
[10:59.97]No one wanted.
[11:01.27]What is your name?
[11:02.13]Here it is.
[11:02.67]Beagle.
[11:06.86]Very well, Smeagol.
[11:10.16]Now, let us start at the beginning.
[11:13.18]What amounts to a small stealth section?
[11:17.03]Hated in every video game we turned into an entire 12-hour experience.
[11:29.85]Sir Gandalf, be all going!
[11:33.88]Oh, let's see.
[11:35.08]Ah, plenty of time.
[11:36.52]We're good.
[11:52.77]Alright, let's be fair.
[11:53.93]Can I be fair?
[11:57.12]Is this game that bad?
[11:59.08]I have no- I've been so completely disconnected from the universe.
[12:03.89]for the last couple of weeks.
[12:05.25]Is it bad?
[12:06.57]Let's go in with an open mind, okay?
[12:08.55]We're going to go in with an open mind.
[12:11.89]I'm telling you, the second that I hear the misty mountains, I'm going to give it a full letter grade.
[12:20.73]Okay.
[12:22.71]Okay.
[12:33.60]Alright, go!
[12:34.64]Go!
[12:35.26]I gotta, I have to hurry.
[12:35.96]I gotta go now.
[12:40.94]I just had to see.
[12:46.41]We just did a little bit of research.
[12:47.43]Do you remember?
[12:53.09]You suck already.
[12:53.93]I didn't even do anything!
[12:57.22]Is there, is there a punch button?
[13:04.37]There has to be a punch button, right?
[13:14.16]He kind of has the face of a cocomelon kid.
[13:19.78]You know what I'm saying?
[13:20.66]I don't know.
[13:21.02]Is something weird about the eyes?
[13:22.36]I don't know what it is.
[13:23.07]Bar jump?
[13:34.64]Oh, nice.
[13:35.52]It's pretty fluid.
[13:38.16]That fucking hurt.
[13:46.96]Why did he do that?
[13:47.77]I don't know.
[13:48.23]Fucking having fun.
[13:53.23]Dude, he bounced.
[13:55.91]The mountains of shadow.
[13:58.11]That is where you are hiding.
[14:03.94]Why does it sound like somebody's hand is wringing his throat?
[14:08.90]It sounds like somebody's got him by his throat.
[14:11.27]Holding his throat.
[14:21.67]Alright.
[14:21.99]What's wrong with this?
[14:22.91]What's wrong with this?
[14:25.18]I don't see a problem with this game so far.
[14:28.26]What's wrong with this?
[14:37.80]Seems kind of fun.
[14:39.38]What's the problem?
[14:41.68]Why does everybody have such a problem with this?
[14:54.71]How do I get up there?
[15:01.83]Golem can really move.
[15:16.52]Gandalf is fucking strangling him.
[15:19.14]That's what it sounds like.
[15:20.50]It sounds like we're hearing this.
[15:39.64]Get up here.
[15:44.76]Grab ledge below.
[15:45.88]Okay.
[15:46.10]I just hit my chin.
[15:52.17]Ah, cutscene.
[15:59.77]Ooh.
[16:01.71]Ooh.
[16:14.62]We're almost there.
[16:19.91]Is that a refund timer?
[16:22.19]No.
[16:23.63]It's a test-it-out, check-it-out timer.
[16:26.41]That's what it is.
[16:31.45]An orc cave?
[16:33.15]Orc live there.
[16:34.32]Yes.
[16:35.06]Hiding from the great eye, we thinks.
[16:37.66]Long gone.
[16:38.62]When we came, the nasty orc looked dead.
[16:43.02]I just keep seeing Gandalf leaning down with both hands around his neck, leaning in.
[16:49.90]And what next?
[16:50.64]Tell me.
[16:52.92]Both hands are around, not just one.
[16:59.70]Look at drawing.
[17:01.36]Did I do this?
[17:02.00]Is that a birthday?
[17:03.24]Is that my health on the lower left?
[17:08.40]Okay, so I have a health bar.
[17:29.16]Yes.
[17:29.32]By the way.
[17:30.06]Hold on.
[17:30.60]Or you have to get the sword and the armor.
[18:02.44]Okay, can I do it?
[18:10.89]What is it?
[18:12.65]What was that?
[18:13.43]I paid four dollars for that?
[18:18.20]Does he dance?
[18:34.89]I bought these.
[18:37.61]How many are there?
[18:38.29]Hold on.
[18:42.47]I paid three or four dollars to have them get scared by bugs sometimes.
[18:54.28]Why did you do that?
[18:55.08]I don't know.
[18:55.44]This is a testing period.
[19:02.53]And for only $3.99, you can get the Gollum and the Bug Comedy Pack.
[19:08.99]Belly laugh out loud while Gollum gets scared of the beetle.
[19:13.21]Laugh with your friends while the beetle puts Gollum on his back.
[19:17.71]That's really what that is?
[19:18.51]I thought it was going to be more than that.
[19:22.95]Is it six emotes?
[19:23.99]Nice.
[19:27.46]Why did you do that?
[19:28.54]Why did you buy that?
[19:31.35]I don't know.
[19:43.80]Just in case anyone was curious, was potentially thinking about their purchase.
[19:48.20]They could see what was available.
[19:49.54]I'm... This game is, I think, getting a lot of bad rap, I think.
[19:53.24]This game's getting some... I don't... I don't... We'll see.
[20:10.70]I'm playing it.
[20:12.30]Let's go.
[20:12.73]Where do I go?
[20:13.97]Is there... Is there a map?
[20:21.97]Oh, there is a map, but... It's kind of awful.
[20:26.38]Where do I... Where am I going?
[20:27.20]Over here?
[20:38.33]I wasn't paying any... Is this way?
[20:42.90]I have to hurry up.
[20:43.46]Am I going the right way?
[20:46.88]No, didn't I come this way?
[20:54.69]Okay.
[20:58.13]Oh, shit.
[20:58.73]I just hit the ground.
[21:00.49]Oh, my God.
[21:01.21]He just broke all his bones.
[21:03.80]Holy shit.
[21:04.40]That sounded terrible.
[21:05.66]He was falling for a long time.
[21:07.38]Oh, boy.
[21:09.58]Okay.
[21:10.04]Okay.
[21:12.32]Where am I supposed to go?
[21:19.10]What am I even looking at here?
[21:26.49]Does anybody know what I'm doing?
[21:30.01]The map.
[21:30.65]I can't read this map.
[21:33.05]What is this map supposed to be telling me?
[21:37.72]Oh, I got it.

[27:49.90]I made it?
[27:50.32]Wait, what?
[28:04.78]I think that was scripted.
[28:07.12]And that's how far you ever went into Mordor.
[28:10.34]We never, never left the clouds.
[28:12.52]Why is it asking us?
[28:17.62]And then you ate the bird in one bite?
[28:20.01]There it is, the spy.
[28:24.55]Two of them.
[28:26.11]Two little croakers.

[30:25.92]What about the bird?
[30:27.86]Forget birds.
[30:29.86]You're on an escort quest and I have to watch you do the escort quest.
[30:33.16]What happened?
[30:34.84]Oh.
[30:35.10]Why did he turn?
[30:36.66]Oh, it's because I'm holding down right trigger.
[30:40.42]Stay in the shadows.
[31:13.81]They don't hear... Oh, shit.
[31:15.25]Oh, no.
[31:15.37]Never mind.
[31:15.59]We're good.
[31:15.91]Out of the building?
[31:16.59]How?
[31:16.81]There's two guards.
[31:17.49]What?
[31:17.67]Oh, shit.
[31:18.24]Okay.
[31:18.58]It's only scar.
[31:38.42]Can we get a timer check?
[31:40.92]Yep.
[31:41.10]Alright.
[31:41.79]Stay up here.
[31:42.53]What is the top of the... What is the mini... What is that thing saying?
[31:51.67]The thing at the top.
[31:53.03]What is that?
[31:53.53]What is that an indicator for?
[31:56.66]Huh?
[32:12.88]It's how close?
[32:14.82]Is that my face?
[32:18.50]Oh.
[32:23.37]It looks like your face.
[32:26.27]Quiet.
[32:36.65]Sneak up an ambush?
[32:38.23]What?
[32:38.53]What?
[32:38.77]Does this work?
[32:39.61]That was the worst orc ever.
[32:44.61]That was the worst orc ever.
[32:46.70]God fucking dammit.
[32:47.44]I was looking at chat.
[33:07.44]Can I just do it right now?
[33:18.71]Shit.
[33:23.29]What's the best brand of root beer?
[33:24.79]I'm gonna say I'm a mug root beer guy.
[33:33.58]Alright, now we get the second one.
[33:50.81]Take stone?
[33:51.92]Wait, you can throw rocks at people?
[33:54.10]This is actually pretty good.
[33:56.78]Dude, mug fucking sucks.
[34:00.14]Excuse me.
[34:00.70]Can I not?
[34:03.06]Okay.
[34:31.89]We're on team.
[34:33.05]We're on team mug.
[34:36.37]Mug is frothier.
[34:37.53]I like a frothy root here.
[34:39.87]Foams up a lot more.
[34:47.30]That's a great thumbnail photo.
[35:01.37]With a spider?
[35:01.95]I mean, honestly, if he slicked it back... If he slicked it back, it would look fine.
[35:17.61]Just put your head in the water, slick it back.
[35:20.33]He'd look great.
[35:21.69]He'd look fine.
[35:36.55]I love one of these beetles.
[35:48.86]Uh oh.
[35:50.50]What?
[36:06.94]We have to make a decision.
[36:09.71]I'm not going to kill the beetle.
[36:11.31]Because I like the beetle.
[36:15.15]No.
[36:16.13]I'm not going to kill the beetle.
[36:19.43]Why would I do that?
[36:22.71]Kill it.
[36:23.61]No.
[36:27.45]Now convince Gollum.
[36:28.68]Huh?
[36:28.90]Huh?
[36:36.58]It just looks for pollen.
[36:37.90]This is so weird.
[36:41.64]Smeagol won the argument.
[36:43.24]That's... I kind of think... I like that.
[36:46.74]That's funny.
[37:07.83]We just had a huge raid come in.
[37:11.53]Oh, boy.
[37:12.29]It's a big one.
[37:13.67]Thank you, Joel.
[37:14.84]Welcome, everybody.
[37:19.22]Got a 2,000 person raid just coming in right now.
[37:26.84]Thanks a lot, Joel.
[37:27.88]Hope you're doing good.
[37:29.29]Welcome, everybody.
[37:34.59]I can't believe there are 21,000 people here watching this.
[37:38.68]Me either.
[37:39.72]Yeah, I've been trying to figure that out for the last like five to ten years.
[37:46.00]Look out!
[37:48.78]It's a- what are they called?
[37:49.80]A Death Eater?
[37:53.74]Is that correct?
[38:00.64]What are they called?
[38:01.60]I don't know.
[38:16.68]You're a fake fan?
[38:20.66]I mean, I like Lord of the Rings.
[38:22.12]I think it's cool.
[38:22.76]I think it's a really cool franchise.
[38:29.05]You haven't even seen the movies.
[38:30.65]Yeah, I have, but it's been like 15 years.
[38:35.51]Jesus!
[38:36.31]Thank God I put a limiter on.
[38:44.31]Find something to eat.
[38:50.07]Mushrooms?
[38:51.85]Do we have to cook food?
[38:52.93]If we do, it's a full letter grade higher.
[38:54.23]What did he just do?
[39:02.96]He just ate that like a weird bird.
[39:05.63]why did he do that he purchased it was like a gopher what was that
[39:42.47]Use Gollum's intuition.
[39:44.49]What?
[39:45.09]Oh, okay.
[39:46.27]Of course there's a detective mode.
[39:49.87]There has to be.
[40:01.50]Use Gollum vision to see.
[40:06.29]With our new Gollum vision technology.
[40:10.95]You'll be able to perceive the world like Gollum does.
[40:13.51]He's in here.
[40:27.45]Let's go.
[40:35.34]Night treasure.
[40:50.40]I don't know.
[40:56.27]Uh-oh, weird violin.
[41:13.32]Weird violin.
[41:20.23]What?
[41:20.63]It's supposed to- I think it's scripting.
[41:58.81]scripted yeah wait what no look at me the only thing that was missing was the last three piano keys being pressed every 15 seconds look at me
[42:26.81]They brought you to him, didn't they?
[42:30.75]The Dark Lord.
[42:33.23]What did you tell him?
[42:35.05]What did you tell Sauron?
[42:39.73]Everything.
[42:43.51]I told him everything.
[42:45.25]I told him about how to crush mushrooms and eat them.
[42:48.77]And eat dirt off the ground.
[42:50.05]I'm sorry Gandalf.
[42:53.05]I told him everything I know.
[43:03.75]Oh, what the fuck?
[43:04.99]Really?
[43:05.33]What the fuck?
[43:35.13]Oh, I also bought the... You can have it be the different language.
[43:40.00]I don't know.
[43:41.00]Does Gollum speak that language?
[43:43.18]What is it called?
[43:45.05]I bought that, too.
[43:48.53]It's the Elvish language, yeah.
[43:52.31]No, not the Japanese language, man.
[44:04.04]I thought that was Gandalf for a second.
[44:05.20]I was like, holy shit, what are you doing?
[44:16.87]Who's in here with us?
[44:22.23]What's that?

[46:25.75]Honestly, I don't even think the graphics are that bad.
[46:30.99]Day one.
[46:42.71]Stop complimenting.
[46:43.73]No, I'm not.
[46:45.29]I mean, this game is not good.
[46:46.79]At all.
[46:49.21]The graphics are fine.

[46:58.84]The graphics are fine.

[47:22.69]The great eye sees us.
[47:25.89]The great eye sees us.
[47:27.83]Whoa, whoa.
[47:29.64]The great eye sees us.
[47:39.01]What does beasts mean, precious?
[47:41.23]What does it mean?
[47:42.13]They'll feed us to some beast.
[47:44.71]But we told him.
[47:45.96]I need to turn on the other language thing.
[48:05.57]Report to the beast master.
[48:08.89]Okay, hold on a second.
[48:12.55]Hold on.
[48:12.91]Wait, wait, wait.

[49:05.50]I thought about me?
[49:08.21]They're talking about me?
[49:34.35]Wait, we have to like escape a beast or something?
[49:38.89]Oh, I'm going to imagine we're all not going to make it.
[49:44.44]OK.
[50:06.06]Cruel orcs.
[50:07.14]Cruel men.
[50:08.78]What has Smeagol ever done to them?
[50:12.40]Oh, Miss Starkland.

[50:24.89]Whatever we want to do.
[50:26.07]We can fight?
[50:26.53]Fight the beast.
[50:27.13]Golem!
[50:50.01]You're going to die down here, Gollum.
[50:51.82]My advice, make your death count.
[50:55.20]You have to get the Boroks back into their pens.
[50:57.68]As fast as you can.
[50:59.22]They let you starve if you're slow.
[51:00.92]Boroks?
[51:01.78]The beasts.
[51:03.14]If they run at you, find cover.
[51:05.24]Get to high ground if you can.
[51:07.02]They don't have the best eyes.
[51:08.24]Yeah, he is walking really fast.
[51:09.84]Like, really fast.
[51:10.40]Alright.
[51:11.58]I will help you.
[51:18.70]We're moving way too quickly.
[51:19.94]Cool.
[51:29.74]Climb the ladder.
[51:30.80]The gate is not for us.
[51:40.56]Okay.
[51:42.30]First things first.
[51:43.32]Slaves chase the cattle.
[51:44.24]Chase the cattle.
[51:45.28]The cattle chases the slaves.
[51:47.17]What?
[51:47.63]You are the bait.
[51:49.03]If you're careless, you'll get trampled.
[51:51.57]Okay.
[51:52.93]Lure the animal into the pen and then quickly shut the gate.
[51:58.02]Those beasts love to break the levers.
[52:01.38]That's why there's another one on top.
[52:05.54]Uh-huh.
[52:06.32]Now down on the other side.
[52:08.38]Carefully.
[52:13.02]Get his attention and run.
[52:26.29]Gollum loves beetles.
[52:40.70]Precious beetle.
[52:59.60]Get up there!
[53:02.72]Oh shit, wrong button.
[53:10.31]Go up!
[53:17.69]And that's it!
[53:18.39]Did I do it?
[53:20.97]Hold on, no it's not.
[53:30.00]Alright, do I have to get both of them in here?
[53:34.08]Okay.
[53:34.38]Let's go.
[53:35.38]They're not even that fast.
[54:01.26]I can't even get up here.
[54:06.44]Can they?
[54:07.52]Can you guys get over here?
[54:12.23]Oh.
[54:14.93]Alright.
[54:27.80]What's going on?
[54:29.10]Come over here.
[54:32.87]My precious!
[54:34.23]Alright, now I'll come over here.
[54:45.96]Break through this.
[54:48.91]Break through this one too.
[54:56.50]Go, go!
[54:56.68]What the fuck is all this shit?
[54:58.64]I don't... What?
[54:59.06]Don't they run away?
[55:23.86]Whoa!
[55:24.46]I thought they weren't in here yet.
[55:28.35]Whoa!
[55:28.79]Gotta make sure I get that tuber gameplay.
[55:34.97]Are you wearing headphones?
[55:36.95]Yes, I actually am.
[55:38.95]Alright, so I gotta go over here.
[55:59.28]God damn it, I fell off.
[56:00.22]No, I didn't.
[56:02.68]I'm doing alright.
[56:04.35]...to humiliate me, I suppose.
[56:29.08]Okay.
[56:31.42]Jeremy, you seem like you like powdered milk.
[56:46.73]I don't.
[56:47.05]And plus, powdered milk is actually part of recipes and shit, so... I mean, it's not like I like powdered milk, but it might be in something I like.
[56:57.06]I don't enjoy powdered milk.
[57:03.11]It's an ingredient in something.
[57:05.81]Alright, so we gotta talk to these people.
[57:11.44]He definitely coats himself in powdered milk.
[57:32.73]No water, no.
[57:33.87]No nice water.
[57:38.11]Disgusting.
[57:49.98]Honestly, they should have gone completely full just wacko mode with this.
[57:54.57]I should have a two-handed mace in my hands.
[57:59.73]And a suit of armor and stuff.
[58:01.11]Just go full comedy.
[58:02.07]Take it out of canon.
[58:02.91]Who cares?
[58:03.27]It would have been so much more fun.
[58:16.50]Ranger!
[58:17.54]Okay.
[58:45.68]This is yawned.
[58:46.32]Uh-oh.
[58:49.18]Games didn't... No, game didn't crash.
[58:50.96]We still... We got an hour.
[58:51.86]I don't want to hear any complaints.
[58:54.75]This is the whole game?
[58:56.05]No, there's more to this.
[59:00.03]This was... No, there's more to this.
[59:02.81]No.
[59:17.96]Find eight tags?
[59:20.10]And when you pick up a tag, be careful.
[59:28.24]Because after two, Slenderman will start to follow you.
[59:32.25]After three, he speeds up.
[59:35.17]After four, he can teleport.
[59:37.09]So be careful.
[59:37.81]What am I doing?
[59:46.32]God, I can't play this.
[59:48.18]There's too much... I need to get eight notes.
[59:55.51]Can I make this jump if I try?
[59:56.77]I can do it.
[60:03.23]I didn't see that.
[60:05.55]You're the guy lying down over there.
[60:11.97]Okay.
[60:18.13]Alright, I just gotta get down there to pick up one of the notes.
[60:22.17]Watch out for the bubble.
[60:22.91]Okay, just be careful.
[60:28.17]Oh shit.
[60:29.63]No, we're good.
[60:30.07]Ooh.
[60:44.09]Okay, one out of eight.
[60:46.09]Okay, I gotta get seven of these.
[60:47.87]Why does it hurt every time?
[60:50.63]Fire.
[60:50.77]Fire that floats.
[61:15.76]I want rocks.
[61:25.67]Jump in the lava.
[61:27.67]I don't want to start this over again.
[61:29.19]How much time do I have left?
[61:30.45]I don't know if there's enough time to go in the lava.
[61:34.84]How do I get back up?
[61:43.06]It'll be really funny.
[61:51.06]I don't know if it'd be really funny.
[61:52.30]I think it would just be moderately chuckle-inducing.
[61:57.06]I don't think it'd be funny.
[62:02.24]Okay, three.
[62:03.22]This is not bad timing.
[62:10.98]You already missed one?
[62:21.96]I can't get up there?
[62:25.86]I missed one.
[62:36.22]How do I get the hell out of here?
[62:47.14]How do I get the hell out of here?
[62:52.99]I'm not actually soft-locked here, am I?
[62:55.37]No, I can... Okay, there we go.
[63:03.19]What?
[63:07.07]What is that for?
[63:08.33]Oh, wait.
[63:13.37]I'm not gonna fall in the lava.
[63:19.88]It was a perfect setup for me to do that.
[63:22.88]But that was just really funny.
[63:25.80]It was wicked funny.
[63:29.48]But that's what you have to do to get it right.
[63:33.43]Okay, so what happened there?
[63:38.81]I cannot grab that.
[63:41.19]Whatever, let's go.
[63:44.15]Oh, right over there.
[63:45.06]Can I...
[63:53.95]There we are.
[63:54.45]Alright, now where's this other one?
[63:59.18]Cross?
[64:06.46]Shit, I don't know.
[64:07.20]No, I want to go down.
[64:12.12]OK, is there one across here?
[64:17.82]Oh my God, I'm fine.
[64:25.15]How do you like the game so far?
[64:26.43]It's, uh... Alright.
[64:36.50]I mean, it's... It is... It is... Orcs.
[64:54.89]Get on the ladder.
[64:55.67]Remember somebody said, dude, don't even play it.
[64:59.07]It's not even funny, bad.
[65:00.17]It's just a bad game.
[65:01.20]And I was like, you know what?
[65:03.06]I needed to play it.
[65:04.78]I promised you guys I would play it.
[65:07.28]The day that I, the stream that I came back.
[65:10.60]I told you I was going to play it.
[65:12.74]You know what?
[65:13.38]I'm happy.
[65:16.90]If this kills me, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[65:26.35]I need to cut this shit.
[65:27.67]How much time do I have left?
[65:28.97]I've got like an hour.
[65:30.07]It's gonna be fine.
[65:31.21]I'm just so impatient.
[65:34.79]I'm just actually completely impatient.
[65:38.34]I need like a punch and a kick.
[65:41.36]You know what I mean?
[65:41.86]Okay.
[65:54.01]Take the elevator like I'm supposed to.
[65:56.15]You cannot just jump.
[65:59.57]Okay.
[65:59.97]This one there and this one there.
[66:01.19]I'm going to go this way.
[66:04.51]What the fuck just happened?
[66:07.23]What happened?
[66:11.43]What actually just happened?
[66:12.61]I can eat.
[66:25.51]Okay, this one down here.
[66:26.31]Okay, five.
[66:33.67]Got that one.
[66:34.37]Oh, fuck.
[66:35.28]Thank God.
[66:35.64]Okay.
[66:35.82]Alright, where's this other one?
[66:37.08]Down here?
[66:37.48]I missed one.
[66:57.95]I'll keep forgetting that's health.
[67:06.89]Is there one here?
[67:08.15]What?
[67:13.92]Take tag or leave?
[67:16.54]Aren't I supposed to be taking tags?
[67:21.09]That way But y'all need two more checks I
[67:53.14]He wants to go home, but he has no home, sweet one.
[67:59.33]Precious.
[68:01.27]Precious is our home.
[68:03.09]Take it back.
[68:04.65]Make oxys do all the work instead.
[68:07.79]I'm done.
[68:08.29]I'm done.
[68:18.83]I was done like an hour ago, but not really.
[68:21.95]I just need to give it a chance.
[68:27.12]I was just so done an hour ago.
[68:30.78]But what if it's fun?
[68:31.88]What if it gets better?
[68:33.48]It could be fun later on.
[68:34.70]Uninstall.
[68:37.87]Refund.
[68:39.67]No, don't refund.
[68:43.24]It could get much better.
[68:44.16]Can I push you off?
[68:46.66]Alright, where is this other one?
[68:49.53]Down here.
[68:50.15]What the hell?
[69:16.70]Where is it?
[69:20.70]He's going to quit?
[69:21.82]Not yet.
[69:23.34]Not yet.
[69:25.31]Sorry, not yet.
[69:27.79]I'm going to die if I hit that.
[69:36.07]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[69:38.47]I have no idea.
[69:39.23]Okay.
[69:43.10]So, around here...
[69:50.00]Why does it keep changing on me?
[69:53.37]Wait, hold on.
[69:59.53]Alright, only one more.
[70:03.54]I hate this place.
[70:05.20]I hate it.
[70:13.88]Last one.
[70:17.71]There.
[70:20.97]People thought I was going to leave before doing this.
[70:23.59]Everyone thought I was going to quit before that.
[70:32.59]You were wrong.
[70:33.13]I'm sorry.
[70:37.40]This is the entire game, by the way.
[70:40.98]But you don't know that.
[70:42.94]You haven't played it.
[70:46.37]You watched the review video.
[70:47.99]They gave this a 2 out of 10.
[70:50.35]You didn't see the rest of this.
[70:53.25]Yeah, I know.
[70:53.81]You saw the review video.
[70:57.82]This game got a 3.
[70:58.96]I know.
[71:02.78]What's happening?
[71:04.06]They're sending the weak up to the tower.
[71:17.61]Give me 40 more tags.
[71:18.81]You sound like you're... What?
[71:21.20]It's my turn?
[71:43.05]I have to put my hands together and say, Precious.
[71:46.59]My precious.
[71:48.61]Oh, no, no.
[71:49.29]Don't go, Precious.
[71:58.22]What are you going to do if I...
[72:10.49]You gotta do something about these bugs.
[72:12.57]What are you gonna do?
[72:13.31]You're gonna hit me with that if I don't go?
[72:18.15]What are you gonna do?
[72:18.81]You're gonna hit me if I don't go?
[72:31.40]So wait, is this Gollum telling this story to Gandalf?
[72:36.11]This is a long story.
[72:39.02]Gollum, skip to the part where you met up with Frodo that time.
[72:42.96]I don't care about anything else in the middle.
[72:45.40]Only relevant information, Gollum.
[72:47.12]I don't really care about anything else you're saying.
[72:53.11]And then we picked up seven tags, Master.
[73:01.77]What?
[73:02.05]Uh-oh.
[73:02.99]Turn to your cell and end the day.
[73:05.21]End the day?
[73:31.18]How do I get out of here?
[73:46.21]Wait, it's probably a secret in here.
[73:48.85]Yep.
[73:51.29]We could use that.
[73:56.60]Nice.
[74:01.65]I can't get away.
[74:03.49]Get off of me!
[74:48.41]Is there a skill tree in this game?
[74:50.29]I hope there is.
[74:50.99]Hmm.
[75:05.34]Hmm.
[75:13.34]Hatching out plans.
[75:15.32]Good, clever plans.
[75:17.43]All dead and gone.
[75:19.67]What are you looking at?
[75:20.95]The bridge?
[75:22.09]The gate?
[75:23.57]Oh, yes.
[75:25.21]That beautiful gate.
[75:27.32]It's right out of Luke Bortz, they say.
[75:29.24]I feel like if you were... This doesn't sound like frail man.
[75:38.73]This sounds like put together, you know?
[75:41.91]Maybe they think it's him whose light burns in the tower.
[75:56.27]Alas, there is only one way into the Tower of Light.
[75:59.79]The one that our sick friend Darimon took today.
[76:03.71]He lost his hope long before he lost his life.
[76:08.03]As most of us do.
[76:10.31]You're just doing your Dark and Darker wizard voice.
[76:14.93]He was obsessed with it.
[76:16.71]A great collection of maps, he told me.
[76:19.79]Stored somewhere in the halls of Grond.
[76:22.54]Oh, do I have to choose who I want my companion to be?
[76:25.68]Right?
[77:00.95]Okay, so what's day twos task?
[77:16.59]Minds.
[77:19.93]Is it is it actually get tags?
[77:27.32]Mines.
[77:29.56]Mines?
[77:29.96]Okay.
[77:39.30]How many days are there?
[77:42.30]How long was Gollum in prison in Mordor for?
[77:47.20]Wasn't it like decades?
[77:52.33]Wasn't he in here for 25 years?
[77:59.41]A hundred years.
[78:04.07]I told you, don't talk to her.
[78:07.56]How do I get water?
[78:08.32]I don't have water.
[78:10.60]Where do I get water?
[78:13.86]You go ahead.
[78:15.44]You can't hurt me anymore.
[78:17.34]What?
[78:18.08]Masters can.
[78:19.20]Cruel masters always find a way to hurt.
[78:25.97]Canonically, I think more than one day.
[78:27.88]I think it was a long, long, long time.
[78:31.30]Show the timer.
[78:42.73]We've got plenty of time.
[78:52.25]Now, it would have been really funny if... Okay, this game is like this.
[78:55.93]But there was actually eight... Or whatever.
[78:58.43]How long?
[78:59.29]Eight years?
[78:59.79]Ten years?
[79:01.00]Five years?
[79:01.42]How long was it?
[79:01.86]Imagine if it was like 3,000 days you had to play.
[79:06.94]That should be kind of funny.
[79:14.24]Alright, what?
[79:14.74]Am I allowed to go through?
[79:15.50]Oh.
[79:20.97]Special honor for you today Some of our little crackers didn't go off last night some dirt eater needs to crawl down the tunnels and light them up Am I gonna explode?
[79:31.37]I'm gonna explode down there
[79:41.51]I hope there's an opportunity to make a mistake down there.
[79:44.79]You know what I mean?
[79:45.90]That's gonna be really funny.
[79:47.32]How is the game?
[79:48.34]It's a four.
[79:48.86]I would say this is like a four or a five.
[80:03.19]It's like a five.
[80:03.81]Out of ten.
[80:04.31]Okay.
[80:04.46]Centrist Andy strikes again.
[80:05.40]A five is a failing grade.
[80:07.14]A five is an F.
[80:32.39]Guys, it's not a one.
[80:42.91]A one means you put your name on the top of the paper.
[80:46.11]You get a one for that.
[80:47.91]Two is you put in random answers.
[80:51.10]Right?
[80:52.66]Three is you got one question right.
[80:57.98]Four is you got like two questions correct, but you tried.
[81:04.18]Yeah, I... Alright.
[81:05.20]Yeah, I think that's fine.
[81:10.52]Guys, teachers don't hand out ones and twos.
[81:13.54]They don't... I don't know.
[81:14.52]I haven't been in school for a long time, but... When was the last time you got a two on your paper?
[81:22.06]A two?
[81:22.48]Okay, so I have to light this on fire and then run.
[81:32.17]You got it.
[81:37.81]Okay.
[81:50.32]Is it safe to do what I'm doing?
[81:54.76]I got it right.
[81:55.30]Okay, so when do I have to ignite something down here?
[82:03.66]Most professors give us zero if you don't even write a full page.
[82:08.28]Wait, what?
[82:10.18]That must be the cracker.
[82:22.68]I just want to see how long it was.
[82:29.05]Alright, get out now.
[82:32.69]Why is it so slow?
[82:39.61]Why is the music getting... Oh, escape.
[82:42.01]Escape what?
[82:43.83]There's no danger.
[82:50.49]Why is the music playing like this?
[82:51.69]There's nothing scary going on.
[83:06.97]Oh, it's...
[83:10.77]I didn't even talk about Jen loss.
[83:12.73]We'll do that.
[83:17.77]Lizzy that saw I was on day two of Ranboo's show.
[83:24.66]It was really fun.
[83:26.66]It will hold on.
[83:28.54]This is actually on a timer.
[83:35.06]Oh shit, it is right there.
[83:39.56]So, you can see in the dark, hmm?
[83:48.33]Do you want to know a secret?
[83:51.27]Let's finish these tunnels first.
[83:53.21]Come this way.
[83:54.73]There are more of these cursed things.
[83:57.07]Yeah, I had a... Wait, what?
[84:00.50]Smeagol wants to go home.
[84:02.06]To the river.
[84:02.96]Nice, cold river.
[84:04.48]Well, you can't, can you?
[84:06.06]Yeah, the prosthetics I was in.
[84:07.22]I'd never done something like that before.
[84:10.76]But I had to get my whole face casted.
[84:14.86]And the way they do that is they put this stuff all over your face.
[84:19.98]It's like silicone stuff and cover your mouth and your almost your whole head.
[84:23.74]But not my it didn't do the back of my head or anything.
[84:26.26]It was just my entire face.
[84:27.70]And I could only breathe very, very slightly out of my nostrils.
[84:33.83]It was an experience.
[84:35.29]It was like, oh shit.
[84:37.49]And then they sculpted on that mold.
[84:47.56]It's really, really, really cool.
[84:52.42]Did you shave?
[84:53.06]Oh yeah, I had to.
[84:53.92]There's no way it would have actually been a blister on my face.
[84:58.12]Oh, I gotta go now.
[85:04.97]Did you get to keep the mold?
[85:06.20]Yes, I actually did.
[85:07.38]I'll show it.
[85:09.94]Unfortunately, it is not here.
[85:11.71]I need to get it.
[85:12.23]I need to get it sent to me.
[85:16.55]But I will show it.
[85:17.62]It's terrifying.
[85:20.55]It's just a one-to-one complete replica of my face.
[85:24.37]With every pore.
[85:26.34]Every... Every wrinkle.
[85:30.00]It is a snapshot of my exact face as a 37-year-old man.
[85:34.68]Sell it?
[85:35.16]Uh, nope.
[85:35.48]No fucking way.
[85:50.33]No fucking way.
[85:51.55]I ain't selling that.
[85:53.81]There ain't no price on that one.
[85:55.21]You could make bank selling it.
[86:17.35]There is no world where I'm gonna be super happy and like, oh yeah, that's awesome.
[86:23.24]Yeah, so new merch drop, guys.
[86:25.24]A one-to-one complete replica down to the pores.
[86:31.12]Identical of my face.
[86:35.01]Complete.
[86:36.87]Better than HD.
[86:38.63]Real life.
[86:39.45]It's like real life.
[86:40.63]It's better than HD.
[86:41.83]It's real life.
[86:43.83]I'm not selling that.
[86:47.63]Have you tried using face ID with your phone with the mold?
[86:53.49]That's actually kind of funny, but no.
[86:56.97]I'm not going to sell that.
[87:02.05]No fucking way.
[87:02.72]In 2,000 years, they'll dig it up and reconstruct you.
[87:16.98]No, I'm smashing it with a hammer before I die.
[87:18.76]Do you know what I mean?
[87:22.43]Like, before I die, one of my requests in my will is smash that fucking one-to-one realistic face.
[87:31.11]Smash it with a hammer into a million pieces.
[87:42.71]Give it to your grandkids?
[87:43.89]No!
[87:44.81]They're not getting shit.
[87:47.07]That sounded bad.
[87:48.13]That sounded bad.
[87:48.97]I mean, I'll get... Why can't I go in here?
[87:54.28]That sounded kind of bad.
[87:55.68]I mean, they're not going to get any weird shit like that.
[87:59.10]They'll get... They'll get money.
[88:03.26]Whatever's left, I guess.
[88:06.85]Think of the precious, my love.
[88:09.45]How it shined.
[88:10.73]How it twinkled in the
[88:13.25]They'll get some money, right?
[88:18.95]They'll see what I have left and they'll be like, why did grandpa do all this shit?
[88:25.34]How much money did he have?
[88:27.10]And you're telling, wait, he put on a dollhouse?
[88:30.82]What the fuck are you talking about?
[88:34.91]Grandpa, where's the money?
[88:36.45]Are you sleeping?
[88:38.61]When they send you into the night, that's when you can sleep.
[88:42.19]What did you spend?
[88:43.95]You spent $70,000 on the Family Guy game?
[88:47.75]Grandpa, what the fuck are you doing?
[88:49.47]Why didn't you just give it to us?
[88:52.33]Why?
[89:01.56]And now he wants bread for crawling through some dirt.
[89:05.90]Get a gold cast of the mask.
[89:07.68]Nobody shall call Kushner unjust.
[89:10.52]Back upstairs with you.
[89:11.86]Oh, that's a brilliant idea.
[89:13.06]Put the inheritance inside of the face mold so they have to smash it to get it.
[89:17.25]Air is better here.
[89:20.99]Frail man can tell us secrets now.
[89:24.55]Remember the dwarves I mentioned earlier?
[89:27.79]One of them told me something once.
[89:30.54]Make a gold bust of your face.
[89:32.04]That'd be so funny.
[89:32.68]That would be a lot of money.
[89:34.07]Oh, shit.
[89:34.67]No, we're good.
[89:35.39]Why?
[89:35.51]Why do you think?
[89:36.55]What happened?
[89:36.99]Well, one day he slipped and fell.
[89:58.30]That's not a nice story.
[90:01.02]I suppose not.
[90:06.37]That's all I'm saying.
[90:07.83]But you gave her water.
[90:10.23]Hey, little Gollum got bread.
[90:14.79]Now Gollum owes it to me.
[90:17.01]What do you mean?
[90:21.45]Your bread?
[90:23.04]Or are you deaf?
[90:24.86]Are you deaf, little Gollum?
[90:28.36]What do you think you're talking to?
[90:31.62]What are you going to do?
[90:32.48]Oh, that I guess.
[90:58.53]Days later Knocked you out for days Stay close to me I can show you
[91:26.95]Yeah, this isn't very good.
[91:31.25]I thought I was going to be running around outside and hiding in bushes.
[91:35.11]I didn't know we were just going to be doing tasks.
[91:38.53]I could see if this was a section of the game.
[91:41.19]Is this the whole game?
[91:58.68]Yeah.
[92:06.78]Is the story any good?
[92:07.72]I mean, it's hard to tell.
[92:15.38]When you realize your relatives have to smash both your head and the bust of your head when you die.
[92:22.69]Oh, that's true.
[92:24.93]That's true.
[92:27.82]There's a lot of new people here, I think.
[92:30.04]Do you guys remember that?
[92:32.68]Should we talk about that really quick?
[92:36.22]Okay, so... When... Okay, let's talk.
[92:41.76]When you die, nobody really knows what happens.
[92:45.30]But there's this prospect that your brain is kind of still going.
[92:51.73]You're kind of still going.
[92:53.93]And just... What happens in there?
[92:56.91]does time slow down in your head and do you essentially live potentially hundreds of years up here because of just like you're kind of dying and you're going and you but you know what I'm saying there's been theories there's been theories about this that like maybe your brain is actually still active for a while and who knows how long you'd be trapped up there for
[93:19.76]So, I don't know.
[93:21.44]What if I don't want to be in there?
[93:23.18]So I made a jokey reference to the second that I flatline.
[93:28.73]Like... Because it could be a thousand years at that point.
[93:32.85]You know what I'm saying?
[93:33.79]Like that one second could be a thousand years after that.
[93:37.75]I just crushed my head with this cinder block.
[93:39.97]The second that it's like... What the fuck?
[93:44.37]Why did it just make the noise it just made?
[93:47.22]What the hell?
[93:50.28]Hey!
[93:50.86]Stay away from her, you imbecile!
[93:57.51]Can you imagine?
[93:58.69]It's in his will!
[93:59.35]You don't understand!
[94:01.63]Yeah, Uncle Frank has to run in with a cinder block.
[94:04.49]No!
[94:04.77]You don't understand!
[94:05.77]It's in his will!
[94:06.41]We have to crush his head!
[94:07.49]Somebody get security!
[94:10.75]No!
[94:11.56]And I'm sitting there in there.
[94:12.76]No!
[94:14.64]No!
[94:16.58]You're under arrest, Uncle Frank!
[94:18.02]No!
[94:20.49]No, shit!
[94:21.49]I'm sorry, Jeremy, I tried!
[94:23.22]Who knows?
[94:42.92]Why do we sleep?
[94:44.34]Right?
[94:44.58]What the fuck is going on?
[94:46.52]Why do we sleep?
[94:48.11]Why do we disconnect from the network?
[94:51.55]For hours at a time.
[94:53.49]Why do we sleep?
[94:55.23]Our brains have to turn off.
[94:57.38]We get disconnected from the network.
[95:00.26]How did I die?
[95:02.12]Did I die?
[95:02.60]Oh.
[95:12.32]It's rest and restoration.
[95:15.11]Yeah, but isn't that so interesting that our brains effectively are a battery that has to be recharged at the end of a 20 hour period?
[95:23.75]You have an iPhone battery there.
[95:27.25]That's interesting.
[95:28.19]It's incredibly interesting.
[95:32.23]What is down here?
[95:39.90]Is there anything I need to get up here?
[95:53.92]What's timer?
[95:55.08]We got plenty of time.
[95:56.54]Relax.
[96:00.95]No one said it was like an iPhone battery.
[96:05.79]I I did.
[96:06.83]I don't mean you have an iPhone battery in your brain.
[96:09.89]I just mean isn't it interesting that we have to turn off to recharge with literally plug ourselves in to a different network to recharge ourselves.
[96:17.29]I don't have to explain myself.
[96:47.30]You don't come down here, right?
[96:49.00]Will you jump after me?
[96:50.36]You kind of don't even look scary.
[96:58.70]It's kind of nice, actually.
[96:59.78]I've heard it compared to clearing.
[97:05.37]Where am I?
[97:08.21]What's going on?
[97:09.53]Where the fuck am I?
[97:12.69]What is going on?
[97:14.08]Am I underwater?
[97:17.07]Um, what?
[97:19.87]How did I get in here?
[97:22.75]Where the fuck am I going?
[97:32.86]Okay, that was, that was very weird.
[97:35.90]Okay, I got, the camera went crazy.
[98:06.18]What?
[98:09.36]What the fuck is going on here?
[98:11.00]Okay.
[98:12.48]The Rattler.
[98:13.42]So far away.
[98:14.34]They're coming!
[98:41.07]Guys, did Gollum win the argument or did Schmeagol?
[98:43.91]It was Schmeagol.
[98:45.62]I'm a good guy.
[99:07.23]Oh, fuck!
[99:08.10]A catagore!
[99:10.54]A caragor.
[99:15.88]Blasted caragors.
[99:26.22]What if he watches us, the Dark Lord?
[99:28.60]What if he sees?
[99:30.22]My tiny Smeagol.
[99:32.00]So many things for him to watch.
[99:34.08]Mountains, enemies, spies.
[99:36.47]No, Lord is looking for them.
[99:40.92]Who is he talking to?
[99:43.78]Oh, I got lost.
[99:44.30]We got 20 minutes.
[100:08.75]I think that's enough to get to Act 3, where we're going.
[100:13.17]I must be patient, my dear.
[100:15.26]Must be very, very careful.
[100:19.74]Wait, I don't have to go in there?
[100:25.73]Oh.
[100:25.85]20 minutes for what?
[100:26.87]20 minutes until I'm going to determine if I'm going to play the game anymore.
[100:35.42]This is nice.
[100:36.10]This is cool.
[100:38.81]I know that was my fucking centrist voice, but just please.
[100:45.14]It was.
[101:03.99]Can somebody give me a rundown of the entire Lord of the Kings story?
[101:10.19]Well, it's Lord of the... I don't think I could even tell you what happens in Lord of the Rings.
[101:17.96]I probably could, but I'm going to get a name wrong.
[101:20.56]I'm going to get a time period wrong, and people are going to scream at me.
[101:34.57]I'll try.
[101:35.03]10,000 years ago, there was this monster.
[101:44.76]He was an elf.
[101:46.32]No, he wasn't a monster yet.
[101:47.90]His name was Sauron.
[101:50.02]He was an elf.
[101:51.46]He had a buddy that made shit.
[101:53.79]He was a blacksmith.
[101:55.13]His name was Celebrimbor.
[101:57.13]So Sauron says to Celebrimbor,
[101:59.67]Hey, what's up, dude?
[102:01.71]So here's what we're gonna do.
[102:03.13]We're gonna make a bunch of rings.
[102:05.17]Rings of power.
[102:06.21]Because we want to, you know, obviously the world, we have to make sure we keep it in balance, and everybody needs to have these powerful things and powerful jewelry in case we have to fight.
[102:13.92]We can, you know, shoot fucking beams at each other from the lasers from the ring, whatever we do.
[102:18.92]So, and now there's a bunch of powerful rings.
[102:21.34]So, they made a bunch of them.
[102:23.70]And they were different, you know, all the different people that were on Earth, whatever this place is called.
[102:28.76]So, you've got nine went to the humans.
[102:32.36]Six went to the dwarves.
[102:34.62]Twelve went to the elves.
[102:36.88]And then five were put in storage in case, you know, just in case there was more needed later on down the road.
[102:42.40]Just in case anybody else wanted more.
[102:44.33]In secret...
[102:46.35]Sauron made Celebrimbor make another ring.
[102:50.39]Essentially, all those other rings I talked about were fake.
[102:52.47]They weren't, like, that strong.
[102:53.59]They weren't really that cool.
[102:54.75]They didn't have, like, the fucking serious drip that the one ring has.
[102:58.00]So Sauron asked Celebrimbor to make a super-powered ring in secret, in private.
[103:05.41]So, Celebrimbor says, oh, this is uncalled for.
[103:09.85]So after he makes it, Sauron punches him in the face with the ring, and he does like this ring punch.
[103:15.56]And it's just like, like shatters his skull and kills Celebrimbor.
[103:19.70]So he can't tell anybody the real secret.
[103:21.86]So Sauron goes on to essentially destroy all of Middle-Earth.
[103:26.74]He kills everybody and takes over.
[103:28.10]Everyone's like, what the fuck's going on?
[103:29.12]Our rings aren't even good.
[103:30.26]Our rings aren't even powerful.
[103:35.34]And that's where... Uh... Bilbo Baggins gets it.
[103:41.94]Eventually.
[103:43.46]And... They... It's like, hey, this ring is too strong.
[103:47.06]We have to destroy it somehow.
[103:50.06]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[103:51.54]Like, this is not even that far.
[104:00.69]This is really not that far of a drop.
[104:03.59]Right?
[104:03.91]What?
[104:04.09]What?
[104:11.15]Dude, you skipped three books.
[104:14.43]Alright, so then Bilbo Baggins ends up meeting Gollum, who at some point, the ring gets lost because I don't fucking know.
[104:24.52]There's a big battle and Sauron loses.
[104:26.92]He gets his finger cut off.
[104:29.01]And during that whole process, it falls down a well and goes down into this rocky area.
[104:33.59]And Gollum finds it.
[104:36.39]Gollum puts it on and for like a hundred years is like the coolest person in fucking Mordor.
[104:43.37]This is a stealth game.
[104:47.00]So eventually, eventually Frodo.
[104:53.40]No, I don't know.
[104:55.92]I could tell, I'm paying attention to something else.
[104:59.32]Okay, so Bilbo Baggins has the ring.
[105:04.34]Oh shit, this happens before.
[105:05.59]Frodo is first.
[105:06.53]No, Frodo's after because he's like an older guy and he does the... and try to get the ring off his neck.
[105:14.64]Turns out, okay, no, hold on, I don't want to get caught here.
[105:17.56]Turns out six of the rings were very powerful, and what they end up doing is the humans, the dwarves, the elves, they all come together and they put their rings together and they summon what is effectively Captain Planet.
[105:31.90]It's, um, it's Gandalf.
[105:34.42]And Gandalf ends up, like, cleaning up a bunch of litter and stuff and tells everybody to, you know, cut the shit and to make sure you recycle your fucking plastic bottles.
[105:43.25]And then he... Oh my god!
[105:53.28]There's no way to get out of here!
[106:44.33]Can you hear this?
[106:48.85]It takes way too long to kill somebody.
[106:50.99]Okay, lights off.
[107:16.41]Did I make it?
[107:18.69]Oh, fuck.
[107:19.41]No, I'm good.
[107:20.59]Oh, come on.
[107:21.69]Where the hell do I go?
[107:23.84]You gotta be kidding me.
[107:27.98]What about Saruman?
[107:29.16]Oh, that's right.
[107:29.78]So, during this whole process, there's... There are many wizards, right?
[107:34.22]There's two blue wizards.
[107:37.44]There's the one gray wizard.
[107:38.58]There's the brown wizard.
[107:40.44]There is the...
[107:42.84]I don't... Saruman is... The White?
[107:45.20]Saruman the White?
[107:46.44]Right?
[107:47.68]Radagast the Brown?
[107:50.26]There's, like, five of them.
[107:53.39]And only one of them really gives a shit about anything, and it's Gandalf.
[107:56.23]The others don't care.
[107:57.35]The others actually don't give a shit about anything.
[107:58.85]They have to be convinced to give a fuck.
[108:00.27]And it takes all the way to the very end of the entire franchise before they actually care.
[108:03.66]That one's true.
[108:13.36]Is there a way to... Actually, I don't think I can go this way.
[108:20.60]Maybe I have to lure him over here?
[108:23.42]Any news on the Black Legion?
[108:25.61]Marching to Dol Guldur soon.
[108:28.35]That's what Kushnach says.
[108:29.71]Oh, that's nonsense.
[108:31.55]The Tarks are still prowling on our doorstep.
[108:37.49]So anyways, Saruman ends up... This is spoilers for the Lord of the Rings, by the way.
[108:42.03]If you don't care, then whatever.
[108:43.43]You know what?
[108:56.04]We're going to play Street Fighter in 12 minutes anyways.
[109:12.73]It doesn't matter if you get the spoilers completely wrong.
[109:15.19]Yeah, that's true.
[109:20.85]But anyways, there's a mountain that they can get rid of the one ring to make sure nobody gets powerful and corrupted ever again.
[109:26.76]But what they don't know is this is a fantasy universe.
[109:31.90]As we all very, very clear and as we all know.
[109:36.00]They could just open up a fucking portal somewhere.
[109:37.71]And it doesn't matter.
[109:38.89]They'll do it again.
[109:40.41]You know what I mean?
[109:40.83]They'll just open up a fucking portal.
[109:42.76]That's all that matters.
[109:43.80]Eventually.
[110:09.94]He's shooting me with a fucking... Okay, I'm done.
[110:14.00]I don't want to play this game anymore.
[110:15.84]I don't want to play this game just to keep the countdown up.
[110:22.26]What is worse than stealth encounters?
[110:26.42]I could do it.
[110:32.84]No, if I could just...
[110:39.23]This is like Glover.
[110:40.03]Glover was actually good.
[110:41.21]This is not... This is bad.
[110:43.31]But it's alright.
[110:44.45]I can do it.
[110:48.78]No shit!
[110:50.04]Okay.
[110:50.60]I just don't want to play this.
[110:57.34]This is obviously wrong, so let me run him back here.
[111:00.06]Is there any way to go?
[111:05.08]Can I jump up here?
[111:08.36]There's got to be a way I can hide in here or something, right?
[111:14.84]I don't... I mean, is this guy just stupid?
[111:22.24]That was dumb.
[111:23.54]That was kind of unfair.
[111:30.86]Alright.
[111:34.62]Time to play Street Fighter VI.
[111:47.59]Am I hidden?
[111:50.20]Oh my god, I am hidden.
[112:02.61]That was weird.
[112:09.78]Shut the fuck up.
[112:10.84]There's no... Come.
[112:11.88]Give me a break, dude.
[112:16.50]Is he still looking?
[112:17.24]No, we're good.
[112:17.70]Alright, alright.
[112:18.10]I finally made it.
[112:19.61]Um...
[112:36.69]Nice.
[112:37.79]Can I dump this?
[112:48.19]No, I can't.
[112:48.75]There it is.
[113:09.53]Think I can get there in just one go.
[113:22.02]Well, I'm done.
[113:22.80]Goodbye.
[113:23.06]I actually can't do this again.
[113:25.62]I refuse to do this again.
[113:28.14]That sucks.
[113:30.08]Am I doing it for a joke half the time?
[113:32.30]Maybe.
[113:33.30]Probably subconsciously, I would say.
[113:34.78]I think that's correct.
[113:43.90]God damn it.
[113:44.78]I... How much time is left?
[113:48.51]Seven minutes?
[113:56.09]This is where Vinny gave up on the game too.
[114:00.34]Really?
[114:00.68]So nobody knows what happens after this.
[114:03.52]Has anyone gotten that far?
[114:16.31]Okay, we're good.
[114:17.91]Don't be stupid this time.
[114:20.03]Don't tell me you lost it.
[114:28.68]What are you... Go investigate the rock.
[114:30.32]I hate this place.
[114:46.04]Go investigate the rock.
[114:46.98]He did it last time.
[114:49.72]You gotta be kidding me.
[114:50.74]Now what?
[114:53.56]Throw it at... Oh, that thing.
[114:55.46]Yeah, I mean... Can't grab me now, can you?
[115:06.02]We're good.
[115:17.27]Okay, now this time just don't jump off and die instantly.
[115:21.13]Go do it the right way.
[115:23.13]Go here, drop here.
[115:24.17]Okay.
[115:27.23]Very cool.
[115:28.43]And I can't die here.
[115:30.77]So, be very, very careful.
[115:33.46]Don't be stupid.
[115:34.18]Oh my goodness.
[115:40.06]Um...
[115:53.99]Oh my God.
[115:57.43]I thought I was gonna, I don't know.
[115:58.89]I was gonna try to break his neck.
[115:59.97]Yeah, that's it.
[116:02.68]I'm done.
[116:04.08]Right on time.
[116:06.22]Right on time.
[116:06.96]We're good.
[116:15.23]So, what I want to do in Street Fighter is I want to do the open world single player mode.
[116:20.58]It was... I tried the demo.
[116:24.86]Alright, that's fun.
[116:26.96]That was the Lord of the Rings Golem's Adventure.
[116:29.88]I just want to check it out.
[116:35.16]See how it was.
[116:35.60]If you like stealth based games.
[116:40.18]And you enjoy...
[116:45.72]I cannot.
[116:46.34]I can't.
[116:47.32]Yeah, I can't.
[116:48.54]Yeah, I can't.
[116:52.22]If you like stealth-based adventure games, if you're a fan of Lord of the Rings, read the books and watch the movies for a 15th or 16th time.
[117:11.52]And get the prequel book and read that one.
[117:18.93]I mean, Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War is great.
[117:22.28]Those are really cool.
[117:24.57]I don't know.
[117:24.99]Maybe if you want to see the story of what happens to Gollum during his time in Mordor, I'm going to recommend that you do some of your own research on this.
[117:35.65]And if you want to check it out, you can go and do some research.
[117:41.20]And I'm still in the game, by the way.
[117:44.20]I actually am still in the game.
[117:51.16]Yeah, I have to get out of the game.
[117:58.27]We're good.
[117:58.55]Alright.
[117:59.91]I'm going to be right back.
[118:00.47]I'm going to pee and get Street Fighter 6 set up.
[118:09.30]And let's see.
[118:11.52]Cool.
[118:11.66]Alright.
[118:13.92]I'll be right back.
[118:36.78]So,
