[00:09.07]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.85]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:13.17]Wait a second!
[00:18.96]Yeah!
[00:20.60]Kick Player Tinkle Up.
[00:22.40]No reason given.
[00:24.64]Get him out of here.
[00:26.16]Oh, get him out of here, booted.
[00:28.46]Hey, welcome to Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:30.02]My name is Jerma.
[00:31.50]Welcome to the party.
[00:32.88]Good to see you.
[00:33.58]Glad you came.
[00:34.52]There is a spy standing just right here.
[00:38.30]Vote failed.
[00:39.10]I'm currently NACL is my name on here.
[00:43.08]What the hell is going on?
[00:44.98]This is just cottage.
[00:46.83]Playing as the combat engineer, like I said, with the frontier justice, the Gunslinger, and the pistol.
[00:51.27]Yeah, that's the pistol.
[00:52.31]Let's see if we can't keep them in their spawn.
[00:57.01]That would be fantastic.
[01:00.02]You know what?
[01:00.40]Let's just put another one down.
[01:01.54]Get out of the way!
[01:04.40]Who's gonna... Whoa, what am I bumping into?
[01:06.46]Oh my god!
[01:08.08]Get out of here, man!
[01:10.78]Spy on top of my spy.
[01:12.24]Sapping my spy!
[01:15.11]Anybody?
[01:15.47]Come on.
[01:16.23]Come on now!
[01:18.79]Who wants to come out?
[01:19.43]Scout wants to come out?
[01:20.51]You're gonna get riddled with bullets, dude!
[01:22.01]I told you not to do that!
[01:23.37]So how about this?
[01:25.53]Every time I die, I'm gonna chug some Dr. Pepper.
[01:29.28]We're gonna chug, chug, chug, chug!
[01:33.52]Is anybody even going to get out of here?
[01:39.96]That sniper just went right through my... almost through my face.
[01:44.70]Yeah, we have them just trapped in here.
[01:49.19]Get me out of here, please!
[01:52.45]That guy can't even, like, build me, like... Are you real?
[01:55.59]Yes, you're real.
[01:58.25]Oh, where's my dispenser?
[02:00.53]Where is my dispenser right now?
[02:01.89]I don't even know where I put it.
[02:02.89]Oh, it's up there.
[02:05.15]Alright, if by two minutes they do not get out of the spawn, I'm going to switch teams.
[02:11.61]See if we can't make something crazy happen.
[02:18.16]Two minutes.
[02:18.68]You got until two minutes.
[02:23.06]Come on now.
[02:24.56]Somebody come out.
[02:26.68]Oh, we only got 13 seconds.
[02:30.34]Ten.
[02:31.30]Nine.
[02:32.26]Eight.
[02:33.18]Seven.
[02:34.44]Six.
[02:35.52]Five.
[02:36.55]Four.
[02:37.65]Three.
[02:38.29]Kick this dude again.
[02:39.85]For no reason.
[02:41.43]And... Time to switch.
[02:43.81]Can't even switch.
[02:45.13]I tried.
[02:45.63]Oh, I died.
[02:51.65]Yeah.
[02:53.44]Can I please switch teams?
[02:54.95]Alright, so we got a team scramble.
[02:57.57]That's what I like to see.
[02:58.99]Hopefully the teams are a little more fair now.
[03:01.47]I'm not going to be able to get this sentry out right away, so let's just go.
[03:05.60]Hopefully I can put one or two back.
[03:09.94]I remember every time I die, I gotta chug Dr. Pepper.
[03:13.70]That's what happens.
[03:14.62]That's the punishment.
[03:15.58]But is it really punishment?
[03:17.65]I find that to be quite a reward, to be honest with you.
[03:21.16]Let's see if I can't get this in here.
[03:24.80]Yeah!
[03:26.74]And this is also right here.
[03:29.49]Hey!
[03:29.81]Hey!
[03:30.19]Hey!
[03:30.45]Get out of here!
[03:31.53]Get off my lawn!
[03:33.33]You rotten kids!
[03:37.79]Hello!
[03:38.47]I need the teleporter to be here.
[03:43.66]Facing this way.
[03:44.44]This is one of my favorite places to put a sentry.
[03:50.66]Or I like to go up, like, there.
[03:52.95]Like, up here.
[03:54.35]But I was a little late, as you saw, so... Let's do it.
[03:59.59]How's that teleporter build?
[04:00.53]Let's hope so.
[04:03.73]You!
[04:05.14]Are you real?
[04:05.92]I don't think you're real.
[04:07.22]You're being in real... You're acting really odd here.
[04:11.48]Oh, but... That's great.
[04:13.96]You!
[04:14.58]Come here, you!
[04:16.84]Hey, follow me this way, Pyro.
[04:18.21]I dare you.
[04:20.24]A double dog, dare ya.
[04:24.38]All I see is a sniper's butt.
[04:26.20]Get your butt out of my face.
[04:31.56]Level 3.
[04:32.80]Good, good, good.
[04:34.40]Fantastic.
[04:35.10]I need to get this... You know what?
[04:36.76]We're gonna go like this.
[04:37.72]It's gonna go back here.
[04:40.97]I know it's probably gonna get taken out by a spy, but you know what?
[04:45.51]Sometimes you just... What is going on here?
[04:48.41]Oh!
[04:49.27]We're good!
[04:52.25]Get that Pyro, get him!
[04:55.59]Get that Pyro, you hear?
[04:59.15]Scout's going around.
[05:01.97]What on Earth is this guy doing?
[05:04.07]No!
[05:04.69]Kill him!
[05:05.03]Nice.
[05:08.41]Build, build, build, build, build!
[05:13.20]Get that to level three.
[05:15.94]Level three's the way I wanna be.
[05:20.23]Make sure you don't get backstabbed by a spy, like this one right here!
[05:33.81]You!
[05:35.64]I'm so paranoid.
[05:36.30]Whenever I play Engineer on Upward, I get so paranoid.
[05:39.10]Because they really could be literally anywhere, because it's so hard to play Engineer, it's so scary!
[05:45.77]Take that so the spy can get it.
[05:48.45]Level 3, and we got... I'll help you with that.
[05:50.83]Let me help you with that, my friend.
[05:53.92]Let me help you with that.
[05:54.82]There we go.
[05:58.82]And they... I might move this entry in a second here.
[06:02.90]Whoa!
[06:07.71]Come on, build it!
[06:08.67]Build it!
[06:09.47]Build it!
[06:10.29]Build it!
[06:11.25]Come on, build this damn thing!
[06:13.86]Yeah!
[06:14.68]Yes!
[06:15.86]Oh, get it!
[06:17.26]Get destroyed!
[06:20.16]Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[06:21.30]That's what I'm talking about right there.
[06:22.64]Let's pull up some kills here, baby!
[06:26.84]Nobody can destroy the Sentry of Doom!
[06:37.74]Save my Sentry!
[06:39.31]Save my Sentry!
[06:40.75]It's dead!
[06:41.19]Oh, no!
[06:45.49]Mortis, Durr, Soulstealer... No, they're gonna get it!
[06:49.19]They're gonna get it!
[06:50.69]Somebody just... Somebody just... Spy?
[06:52.67]Thank you, Spy.
[06:53.50]That Spy was fantastic.
[06:56.66]No!
[06:57.14]Don't let him get it!
[06:57.74]Don't let him get... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't... How did this guy get back here?
[07:02.12]Wait, oh my god!
[07:03.04]I thought that was three snipers.
[07:06.40]Don't... Don't let it happen.
[07:08.72]I don't care if I have to club somebody in the face.
[07:12.90]Come on!
[07:13.40]Come on!
[07:14.68]They're gonna get it!
[07:15.28]They're gonna get it!
[07:15.96]They're gonna get it!
[07:18.50]No, they aren't!
[07:19.40]No, they aren't!
[07:20.38]Use your body!
[07:21.44]Use everything!
[07:24.58]No!
[07:27.44]Damn it!
[07:29.35]God damn it, man!
[07:30.67]Alright, I'm changing up.
[07:34.03]No, I'm not.
[07:34.67]Stay in, Engineer.
[07:36.01]My sentry's still alive?
[07:37.95]Where the hell is my sentry?
[07:40.84]Where is... Oh, my sentry's right there.
[07:44.92]Come on, little sentry.
[07:46.68]Take him out, little sentry.
[07:50.22]Hey, at least if it goes down now, that's okay.
[07:51.75]I'm okay with that.
[07:53.95]I am okay with that, because I get nine revenge crits.
[07:56.23]I'm okay with that.
[07:59.79]Just gotta get something going here.
[08:02.17]Me and my suit jacket.
[08:04.76]Oh, no, no, nothing much.
[08:05.70]Me and my suit jacket are just having a good time.
[08:11.96]Three minutes.
[08:12.96]We can hold him.
[08:13.42]Three minutes.
[08:14.30]Hey!
[08:14.64]Hey!
[08:15.72]You... That's it.
[08:17.34]You know what?
[08:17.98]I'm sick and tired of this.
[08:19.90]I'm just gonna go down here.
[08:25.66]Who else wants to get crit?
[08:27.08]Who else wants to get... Soldier.
[08:32.11]No.
[08:32.63]Pyro.
[08:35.05]They're gonna, like, steamroll now.
[08:36.45]This is not cool, man.
[08:39.48]What do I got for Pyro?
[08:41.40]Good enough.
[08:42.74]Good enough.
[08:46.65]Just hold him.
[08:48.37]Hold him, hold him, hold him.
[08:51.37]Hold him.
[08:53.21]Don't let him get over here.
[08:56.37]I just saw a bastard right here.
[09:01.42]What are you doing?
[09:03.96]Oh, get clubbed!
[09:06.68]And I walk right into that...
[09:08.74]Are you absolutely... That made up for the second time.
[09:17.46]Oh, I was supposed to drink twice.
[09:19.14]Because I died before that as the engineer.
[09:20.92]I don't even know if I did this or not.
[09:22.08]I forget.
[09:22.44]This can is empty.
[09:29.16]That was a bad idea.
[09:31.56]Chug.
[09:32.08]Chug.
[09:32.58]Chug.
[09:33.56]Ready?
[09:33.96]Ready?
[09:34.98]Come on, everybody!
[09:35.92]Crit fire!
[09:37.13]That's the name of the game!
[09:40.49]Get over here, man.
[09:42.13]Where's this sniper?
[09:45.41]Heal me, please.
[09:48.11]Somebody heal me.
[09:49.31]Medic, please heal me.
[09:51.73]Please.
[09:52.47]Thank you.
[09:53.17]Thank you.
[09:57.17]Who wants it?
[09:58.63]Who wants this?
[10:00.49]Oh, you want this, medic?
[10:02.31]You!
[10:04.09]You want this?
[10:04.49]Is this what you want?
[10:05.50]Is this what you want?
[10:07.16]Ugh!
[10:10.13]Whatever, just get him!
[10:11.15]Just shoot him!
[10:13.31]Oh, I'm like burping every eight seconds.
[10:16.98]Get rid of that.
[10:17.94]Get rid of that!
[10:18.54]What the hell is going on?!
[10:20.60]Did you see how long that just took?
[10:21.94]What was that all about?
[10:24.24]I got nothing to drink.
[10:28.83]Dude, did- I was holding- What is my ping?
[10:32.55]Why can I not- Why is tab not working?
[10:36.15]Alright, whatever.
[10:37.93]I was holding the button down on that mini sentry for like way too long.
[10:43.53]It's alright, we got this.
[10:45.35]This is gonna be a GG if I do say so myself.
[10:50.57]Maybe not, maybe not, maybe not.
[10:52.33]Maybe not.
[10:56.77]Get off of this.
[10:57.87]Get out of here.
[10:59.73]Oh, it was worth it.
[11:00.41]It was worth it.
[11:02.81]No, they're gonna cap it!
[11:04.07]Oh my god!
[11:05.84]Get him off that!
[11:08.34]Get him off it!
[11:09.12]Get him off it!
[11:10.38]Come on, man!
[11:12.06]Come on, man!
[11:14.42]Three!
[11:15.77]Two!
[11:17.05]One second!
[11:18.89]Mmm!
[11:19.81]Yeah!
[11:21.63]Nice job, guys.
[11:22.75]Nice job.
[11:24.33]You did a fine job tossing your little balls around.
[11:28.85]So that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[11:30.33]Thank you so much for watching.
[11:31.31]I really do appreciate it.
[11:32.94]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[11:34.74]And of course, the strongest man in the world.
[11:39.10]Take care, everybody.
