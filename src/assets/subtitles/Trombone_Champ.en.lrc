[00:00.07]How you doing?
[00:01.41]What's up?
[00:01.81]What's up?
[00:02.21]How you doing?
[00:03.47]Doing great.
[00:03.95]Good.
[00:04.23]Hold on.
[00:05.09]I gotta cough.
[00:05.85]Okay.
[00:30.75]Yeah, we're gonna play trombone champ.
[00:34.21]Start.
[00:37.71]From there.
[00:39.60]This game is apparently an hour or two, right?
[00:45.08]Did you get sloppy what?
[00:46.78]Because I had to cough.
[00:52.37]No, no, no.
[00:52.89]I don't turn 37 and everybody starts calling me sloppy.
[00:55.11]That's not how this... No, no, no, no.
[00:56.71]I am... I am built like a fucking... some kind of animal, whatever it is.
[01:04.63]I said in pre-stream this was not going to be a crack stream and I'm going to... I'm staying by it.
[01:11.34]I don't know.
[01:11.78]Something in the air today or yesterday.
[01:13.74]I don't know.
[01:14.42]I'm just like... I'm in a weird mood.
[01:20.48]I have this constant urge to just say just weird shit.
[01:24.60]I don't know why.
[01:25.08]I just think it's fun to me today and yesterday.
[01:26.96]Is it because it's a blood moon?
[01:31.75]Is it?
[01:33.67]It's CO2 poisoning?
[01:35.33]No, it's not.
[01:37.19]You know why I know it's not?
[01:39.13]I know it's not CO2 poisoning because I have a CO2 monitor in my place.
[01:47.11]I know exactly how much carbon dioxide is in the air at any given moment.
[01:51.93]So I know, I know the exact parts per million of CO2 in this place.
[01:59.22]Would you like to know what it is?
[02:05.36]I can tell you right now.
[02:09.63]Yeah, why do you guys think I got the water quality test strips?
[02:12.01]I mean, I pissed on one for a joke, but...
[02:18.70]The CO2 in the air inside of my place ranges from 480 to like 600 or 700 at night with the window closed.
[02:31.58]As long as that number is under 800 or 900.
[02:37.32]The typical indoor environment for CO2 is 400 to 800, 400 to 700.
[02:47.16]It's too much.
[02:48.00]No, not degrees.
[02:48.92]This motherfucker opens his windows at night.
[02:56.35]Yes.
[02:58.23]Did you know?
[03:00.77]And... Okay.
[03:02.27]Alright, yeah, let me... Yeah, I watched the Tom Scott video where he talks about CO2 and I freaked out and bought a CO2 monitor.
[03:12.32]That's what happened.
[03:15.48]Like everybody else...
[03:25.76]Are people hooing Tom Scott?
[03:27.20]Are you crazy?
[03:31.91]No, that's not possible, right?
[03:36.27]Yeah, so in the Tom Scott video, Tom Scott was essentially showcasing another YouTuber who trapped himself in an airtight chamber and monitored the CO2 and monitored how he felt once it hit certain parts per million.
[03:53.78]It's very interesting stuff.
[03:56.72]If you have a moment to check it out, I would.
[04:02.57]I saw the video.
[04:03.15]I freaked out.
[04:05.21]And I bought a CO2 monitor.
[04:07.45]And ever since, I've been keeping an eye on it.
[04:09.85]And I open up the windows, get some air flow.
[04:13.03]That's how you reduce CO2.
[04:17.27]Which is actually kind of hard in Vegas.
[04:19.47]Because it gets really, really hot.
[04:22.69]And really, really cold.
[04:23.95]You're paranoid.
[04:24.75]No, I'm not.
[04:27.92]What just simply like monitoring the CO2 it is what that's supposed to be paranoid.
[04:33.44]Yeah, it's a gas.
[04:39.14]It's a CO2 gas.
[04:41.04]You think I'm not going to be concerned about it a little?
[04:43.16]No, you be aware of kind of your surroundings, you know.
[04:51.32]Be aware.
[04:56.52]But no, honestly, the Tom Scott video is actually really interesting.
[05:02.28]Tom Scott's videos are so cool.
[05:04.60]Because it's not just typical stuff.
[05:06.00]It's just like, this water behind me is electrified.
[05:09.28]If you touch it, you will die.
[05:10.82]And I'm like, what?
[05:11.42]Where is this?
[05:13.41]Why is this water electrified?
[05:14.97]Who did this?
[05:17.13]And then he goes into this whole thing.
[05:19.07]And the videos are not like, they're short.
[05:24.38]And it's true.
[05:25.22]If you did, if you touch that water, you're going to get electrocuted.
[05:28.68]It's not bullshit.
[05:34.87]Oh yeah, I do.
[05:36.27]I watch Tom's videos.
[05:42.33]The average human emits over two tons of CO2 a week.
[05:46.18]Is that real?
[05:48.65]Well, the reason why you want to monitor your CO2 in your bedroom, well, whatever, is because at night, you're exhaling in the same room, sometimes with the door closed.
[06:01.65]And you are just dumping CO2 into your room.
[06:06.41]Just for eight, seven, six, seven, eight, nine plus hours a night.
[06:11.15]And if you don't have ventilation and the door is closed,
[06:16.22]You want to get some nice fresh air in there sometimes.
[06:18.16]Maybe you don't have to sleep with the window open, but you know, if weather permits, crack the window for a little bit.
[06:26.54]That'd be all day.
[06:28.78]Crack the window for a little bit, just for a little bit.
[06:32.99]Especially during these months where you can.
[06:41.48]What if it's too noisy?
[06:43.04]Also, another thing is air flow.
[06:45.62]So, look, I watch Tom Scott, okay?
[06:48.02]I'm going to give you some education here.
[06:50.62]I'm a Tom Scott watcher.
[06:51.84]Let's go.
[07:01.57]Teacher.
[07:08.21]But no, if you have the door open to your bedroom, at least, the air can kind of move in and out.
[07:16.33]Yeah, I just... Look, you're not... Okay, I don't want to, like, do some fear dropping here.
[07:23.23]Your CO2 levels in your house... You're not going to... You're going to be okay.
[07:26.85]Alright?
[07:27.95]I think it's over... What's the... Over 1,000?
[07:29.62]Over 1,200 parts per million is considered, like, really stale and not good.
[07:37.17]So most typical houses sit between a very average, very fine level.
[07:43.09]Just open your windows every now and again.
[07:44.57]Just get some fresh air in.
[07:47.60]Oh, it kind of reminds me of a story.
[07:49.36]Actually, it's a tweet that I never tweeted out.
[07:53.06]So one time when me and Holly first started dating, I had... Wait, did I tell this already?
[08:00.43]Did I already tell this?
[08:05.02]It's about me opening the door for a reason.
[08:08.08]OK, well, I'll tell it anyways.
[08:10.10]OK, so when me and Holly started first dating, I obviously didn't want to like fart near her.
[08:18.68]So what I did is I... She was in another room and I went to the front door and I opened the front door and put my ass out the front door and went like, and like farted.
[08:34.64]And maybe a full half second after I farted, a gust of wind blew from my back back into the house and I freaked out.
[08:43.84]I was like, no, not the whole reason why I did this.
[08:54.58]Well, nobody, okay, I don't care what anybody says.
[08:57.86]Nobody in the first three to six months of their relationship goes to the bathroom.
[09:06.49]Do you know what I mean by that?
[09:08.55]Like, in the first three months of a new relationship, nobody goes to the bathroom.
[09:13.38]Nobody has to take a shit.
[09:14.58]It doesn't work that way.
[09:16.92]I, like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[09:19.96]Yeah, yeah, come over, yeah, okay, hold on, but, like, before you come over, though, I've gotta, like, work on the car in the garage.
[09:25.63]It's like, I need, like, I'm gonna spend, like, 40 minutes going to the bathroom to make sure I don't have to.
[09:32.27]Like, farting in front of a new girlfriend or a new boyfriend, that's not gonna happen.
[09:37.11]I'm sorry.
[09:40.34]If I have to take a shit and, like, my new partner is over, my new girlfriend is over, whatever...
[09:46.46]I have to go work on the car.
[09:48.28]And, oh, hey, by the way, um... Oh, by the way, like, downstairs, there's an electrical problem.
[09:53.64]Don't come down here for an hour.
[09:59.63]You can't come... Don't come into this room for, like, an hour.
[10:02.55]There's an electrical problem.
[10:05.73]Just, like, freak him out.
[10:12.31]I don't do that.
[10:13.09]I'm fucking kidding.
[10:13.91]This is a joke.
[10:18.18]Hey, there's CO2 in that room.
[10:20.11]Don't go in that room.
[10:24.99]Imagine being a neighbor walking by and your neighbor opens his door and rips ass out the door.
[10:31.11]Imagine being on like a security cam, like somebody else's security cam.
[10:45.21]Like, imagine, like, oh, what happened on the security camp today?
[10:47.52]And it's like, wait, what's going on?
[10:57.74]A ring doorbell.
[11:02.78]Oh, my God.
[11:05.52]But anyways.
[11:06.14]Yeah, I don't like to just, like, rip ass in front of a new girlfriend.
[11:14.49]I don't think anybody does.
[11:16.45]You have to give me the benefit of the doubt here.
[11:21.83]Most people don't really do that immediately.
[11:24.59]It's not like, oh, hey, yeah, come on in.
[11:26.53]Oh, yeah, this is my place.
[11:27.97]Oh, yeah, let me give you a quick little tour.
[11:31.17]Sorry, I farted.
[11:32.09]It was loud.
[11:32.91]Oh, be careful.
[11:33.87]Oh, come on over here.
[11:34.65]It's like, what the fuck, man?
[11:35.85]What are you talking about?
[11:37.55]That's not going to happen.
[11:39.59]I don't think any of you will do that.
[11:44.39]Who is going to do that?
[11:48.91]I don't know what I don't know.
[11:50.67]Jupiter is in some kind of blood moon right now.
[11:53.23]I'm sorry.
[11:54.11]The last two days have been weird.
[11:55.21]I've been very, very like overly energetic and shit.
[11:57.89]What's going on?
[12:11.13]Dude, just part like everybody else.
[12:18.85]You just turned 37.
[12:19.53]Yeah, and I'm trying to tell you how I'm a considerate person.
[12:25.34]I don't want to invite somebody over and fart on them.
[12:31.00]What?
[12:33.94]How did you draw this this quickly?
[12:35.22]You've been talking about farts for 10 minutes straight.
[12:49.67]Yeah, okay.
[12:50.61]If people want to play the, you're 37, why are you talking about farts card?
[12:54.65]Okay.
[12:55.83]I want you to, I'll open up every television show in the last two decades.
[13:02.31]And I want you to find me, I want you to tell me that there's no, like, fart jokes in that show in the last, like, 20 years.
[13:11.79]And those shows are written by, like, 40-year-olds plus, 50-year-olds.
[13:20.13]Simpsons.
[13:20.61]Simpsons had a ton of fart jokes.
[13:21.69]What are you talking about?
[13:23.45]Breaking Bad had a huge fart joke.
[13:24.83]Remember when, when, uh, when Walt put his legs behind his head and took a lighter and farted into it and made it a flame?
[13:32.33]That happened.
[13:43.03]I just spilled shit all over me because I'm sorry not to laugh at that.
[13:50.98]I'm sorry, the reaction, alright.
[13:53.50]God damn it.
[13:54.98]Hold on.
[13:56.46]We're in Game of Thrones.
[14:01.93]Yeah, you don't remember in Game of Thrones when, when Grand Maester Pycelle did the lighter fart flame joke?
[14:10.71]All these old horns are hard to move, but... And he puts his legs behind his head.
[14:24.81]Let me ask you a really quick question, though.
[14:28.39]If, okay, be very honest, and I want to poll for this.
[14:31.98]If Grand Maester Pycelle did that in the final episode of Game of Thrones season eight, you would have a better, you would have a better view of that whole show.
[14:44.76]I guarantee it.
[14:47.94]People wouldn't care that it ended terribly and like the last season was terrible.
[14:51.26]It was like, holy shit, we got like the Grand Maester Pycelle dumb and dumber Jim Carrey fart scene.
[14:56.36]I don't care anymore that the show was terrible.
[14:59.28]I get that.
[14:59.94]We had that now.
[15:09.41]Or he does it.
[15:09.91]He does it to like kill a skeleton.
[15:20.30]Alright, I gotta clean.
[15:21.06]I spilled this shit all over me.
[15:22.58]Hold on.
[16:12.75]Have I been sitting here for 20 minutes doing this?
[16:15.07]What the fuck, man?
[16:17.63]The stream's been on for 17 minutes.
[16:26.44]I need like a producer in my ear.
[16:28.84]Just being like, hey dude, it's time to move on.
[16:35.72]Hey, hey, move on to something else.
[16:42.81]But his thing, I would probably ignore the producer.
[16:46.32]I probably would.
[16:49.08]You guys would honestly think I was even more unhinged.
[16:50.92]Because I would be referencing the producer.
[16:54.92]Without even telling you that I was talking to anybody else.
[16:57.97]If I was sitting here talking about farting out the front door.
[17:00.29]And my ear was, hey dude, no, no, no, move on.
[17:03.01]I'd be like, I'm not going to move on.
[17:04.01]Don't tell me to move on.
[17:05.89]And you guys would be like, who the fuck is that?
[17:07.17]Alright, we're going to play Trombone...
[17:13.94]Trombone Champion.
[17:22.95]It's a game I requested to play.
[17:25.03]It looks like it's really fun and interesting.
[17:26.55]I don't know.
[17:27.33]I don't really know much about it.
[17:29.57]What I do know is other streamers played it.
[17:31.87]It's now my turn.
[17:33.84]That's all I know.
[17:36.22]Okay.
[17:43.30]It's fun?
[17:44.50]Well, let's go.
[17:44.90]Alright, so how does it work?
[17:51.94]It's funny?
[17:55.28]Northernlion played it?
[17:56.06]Fucking love that guy.
[18:01.74]Alright, let's go.
[18:08.09]Are you sure you want to start a new game in slot 1?
[18:10.15]Yes.
[18:15.94]That hurt.
[18:22.94]And so it comes to pass.
[18:27.39]Ages after the twin vessels were forged, a new soul appears.
[18:35.29]Brave soul, one day you will stand before two baboons.
[18:44.04]One day you will rend the very fabric that binds this land.
[18:53.09]But until that day comes, you must toot.

[19:44.61]Turn up the baboon quality.
[19:45.83]No, we're not, I'm doing normal.
[19:47.27]I'm not going right into this.
[19:50.09]Let me just play it first.
[19:51.87]I'm just going to play it.
[19:52.57]I'm not going to, oh, turn on this like funny mode.
[19:54.27]Why would I turn on like DK, whatever it is.

[20:28.75]You play the game first.
[20:30.95]Alright.
[20:32.25]Let's go.
[20:32.86]Trombone.
[20:33.40]There's other instruments?
[20:34.14]Alright.
[20:34.44]I don't even care.
[20:35.22]I'm gonna 100% this right now.
[20:36.56]Are there licensed songs in this?
[20:49.35]Move the mouse forward and back to move the slide.
[20:52.43]Line up the dot with the note lines.
[20:55.71]So you go this way to go... Press left... What's better?
[21:03.15]Mouse or keyboard?
[21:10.45]Mouse... Press left mouse to... Button or any letter to toot.
[21:15.03]Play well, you build combos.
[21:16.47]Alright, let me just, let me see how it works.
[21:19.90]Watch the breath meter.
[21:21.54]If you hold a note for too long, you'll run out of breath.
[21:23.78]Okay.
[21:26.84]Have fun.
[21:27.97]Okay.
[21:29.35]Enjoy the beautiful, succulent...
[21:42.99]It's supposed to be inverted?
[21:47.42]It's inverted.
[21:50.04]Can I change that?
[21:53.74]It's inverted.
[22:13.96]I gotta change the inverted thing.
[22:22.69]I feel like there's a... I feel like there's a kid in the house really practicing for their band practice tomorrow.
[22:46.91]Okay, this is fun.
[22:54.36]Oh, what?
[22:54.86]Okay.
[22:55.38]Alright, I get it.
[22:57.76]This is funny.
[22:58.40]It's fun.
[22:58.80]I actually think this is cool.
[22:59.92]Alright, let me... I don't want it to be inverted.
[23:01.42]I feel like I'm, like, flying a plane or something.
[23:11.06]Not inverted.
[23:14.43]Is that cheating?
[23:18.90]Is it cheating?
[23:19.36]Okay.
[23:21.44]I just want to make sure it's not cheating.
[23:23.47]Alright, this is... Oh, this is... There are between two and four spiders living inside the average trombone.
[23:33.01]That's not real.
[23:35.19]Two characters?
[23:35.85]What? ...
[23:52.69]This is the New Year's Eve party.

[25:27.73]No, I wasn't.
[25:49.16]I wasn't laughing at my own son, I was merely enjoying the song.
[25:52.44]Alright.

[93:55.60]Slider.
[94:23.45]Did I miss one note?
[94:34.32]K.K.
[94:34.58]Slaughter, yeah.
[94:40.12]Should I get an S on the warmup?
[94:46.93]I want to unlock one more thing, at least.
[94:50.11]Play as the new character?
[94:51.15]Oh, shit.
[94:51.61]Okay.
[95:23.15]Do it again, I can do it perfect.
[95:24.57]I gotta do it perfect.
[95:31.30]What's going on?! !
[96:19.02]I didn't miss a single note.
[96:25.06]Alright, so that's perfect.
[96:27.31]I didn't miss a single one.
[96:52.54]Alright, how many points do I need?
[96:53.82]2,500, right?
[96:54.22]Alright, it's going to jump scare everybody.
[96:56.30]So just be ready.
[96:58.38]Be aware.
[96:59.26]One more and... The game looks fun.
[97:01.84]It is.
[97:22.76]Do the new character.
[97:23.44]New character.
[97:24.00]Alright, alright.
[97:32.53]Where's, uh... Oh!
[97:34.57]Alright, I need more points.
[97:42.38]What was that really cool one that we liked?
[97:48.12]What was that... What was the really cool one?
[97:57.81]Oh yeah, this one.
[98:01.29]Where is it?
[98:03.51]Yeah, this one.
[98:05.27]Wait, am I gonna get points for doing this?
[98:06.49]I already got an S on it.
[98:08.24]Do you get points if you completed something and you do it more?
[98:29.31]And it makes me want to fly so high.
[100:33.09]I thought the song was over.
[100:33.91]Sorry.
[100:36.98]That's better than the last time.
[100:42.52]Way better than the last time.
[100:44.32]How come you're not singing the song?
[100:50.55]Auld Lang Syne.
[100:52.25]Auld Lang Syne.
[102:59.45]I wasn't ready for this solo.
[103:03.08]That's better than last time.
[103:14.18]Please blink.
[103:15.04]I'm fine.
[103:15.78]I'm blinking.
[103:17.79]Alright, do I have enough points?
[103:33.24]He's a lizard!
[103:34.18]Wake up!
[103:34.60]If I was a lizard, I'm just gonna clear the record here.
[103:44.40]If I was a lizard, I would not be streaming.
[103:47.54]I would be lying outside on a fucking rock with my eyes just closed for 14 to 15 hours a day.
[104:02.05]Right in the sun.
[104:12.47]You look like Shaggy.
[104:13.47]I know, because I'm wearing a green shirt.
[104:15.07]It's a solid green shirt.
[104:17.79]You just, you're Shaggy, I guess.
[104:25.32]Every time I wear this, people say Shaggy.
[105:04.26]8-bit?
[105:05.38]Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[105:10.68]There's more?
[105:11.38]Alright, I want to do that.
[105:12.52]That sounds fun.
[105:19.40]I know I said I was going to play Breath of the Wild, but I want to... Hold on, I'm not done.
[105:35.95]I can click on something here.
[105:38.78]Build card?
[105:41.00]Turd card.
[105:41.90]Wait.
[105:46.03]Donut?
[105:46.21]Oh, these are my doubles.
[105:47.95]Should you ever have more than two?
[106:13.72]You're playing the Clout Chaser game.
[106:20.55]I'm having fun, man.
[106:21.81]It's a fun game.
[106:52.73]That's my legendary trombone card.
[106:54.91]Oh, this is how you- okay.
[107:02.75]I-
[107:35.10]Silver trombone.
[107:37.52]Should I just do it again?
[107:52.43]I don't wanna-
[108:24.64]Let's go!
[108:25.04]That's gotta be fastest ever.
[108:27.22]That's the fastest ever.
[108:28.69]I don't think anyone's done it faster than that.
[108:33.91]Wait, what?
[108:57.12]no shit I need I just want to see what it looks like let's see what it sounds like
[109:49.36]Alright, let's do it.
[109:50.47]Let's do 8-bit.
[110:13.65]so so
[110:39.59]Thank you.
[111:08.57]Thank you.
[111:37.07]Why's your face crooked?
[111:39.65]I dunno.
[112:08.39]Blame God.
[112:09.37]I didn't get S.
[112:52.31]Thanks for watching!
[113:26.88]Started over, I fucked it up and I got all fucked up in my head.
[113:29.92]My head got all fucked up.
[113:30.84]Let's do it again.
[113:49.28]Thanks for watching!
[114:19.43]I'm gonna try spacebar.
[114:44.27]No, that's scratching your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time.
[115:03.04]Thank you.
[115:31.54]I think Booker's verified us!
[116:19.80]A little bit ba- I got at least an A. It was a B before, I got an A. Alright, I'm gonna take the 8-bit sound effects off.
[116:26.40]It kinda hurts my head.
[116:49.74]Alright, we gotta get at least A, right?
[116:51.98]Entertainer.
[116:54.08]I gotta get at least an A in everything.
[116:58.73]Ugh.
[117:19.72]Bye.
[117:45.89]Thank you.
[118:14.82]Fuck.
[118:15.08]One more try and that's it.
[118:33.49]Thank you.
[118:47.14]Thank you.
[119:14.40]That's A!
[119:56.56]I think that's it, right?
[119:57.61]Any more B's?
[120:01.51]No, I got all A's and S's.
[120:02.70]That's it.
[120:04.32]Can I afford anything else?
[120:26.77]I can go higher than that.
[120:34.22]Not enough.
[120:34.80]I got an A on this.
[120:37.64]The ones that are easy, I should be able to get S's on, right?
[120:58.21]Let me go back to this one.
[120:59.31]Seriously, like, I can do this one.
[121:01.09]I screwed this one up big time.
[121:02.79]Here we go.
[121:04.33]I'm definitely going to get at least a better score on this one.
[121:44.69]My finger hurts!
[121:46.53]I'm so mad.
[121:47.43]My finger started to like... I was like made of stone.
[121:52.43]I couldn't click.
[121:57.40]Use the keyboard?
[121:57.92]I can't.
[121:58.56]I have to use my right hand.
[122:01.96]You know when you do, when you move too many times?
[122:03.90]It's like doing reps.
[122:05.49]The lactic acid like builds up.
[122:08.21]And it's just... I can't click anymore.
[122:13.47]I'm sorry.
[122:15.76]Alright.
[122:16.21]One 60 second break.
[123:28.99]Thank you.
[124:34.63]Woohoo!
[125:05.87]My fucking finger hurts.
[125:09.29]Oh, you just can't, man.
[125:10.83]Nah, you gotta start with, you gotta start with that one.
[125:35.92]I got a better score.
[125:43.00]I got a better score, that's fine.
[125:48.77]It's the, like, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, and having to click and move.
[125:55.51]Alright, what about, um... What about this one?
[126:02.61]Maybe I can get this one to S.
[126:07.84]Take a break.
[126:08.73]I'm a gamer.
[126:09.39]I can't.
[126:40.64]Thank you.
[127:37.66]That's an S, right?
[127:41.42]Yes!
[127:49.25]Alright, one more.
[127:57.19]That's it.
[127:57.59]One more and I'm done.
[128:03.02]I thought it was going to be different than that.
[128:27.08]Good start.
[129:20.49]Is that better than the last one?
[129:21.35]Not by much.
[129:25.92]Fuck.
[129:26.64]It's alright.
[129:29.04]It's just the... You know what I mean.
[129:32.34]Alright, let me unlock my thing, and then I'm gonna switch to Breath of the Wild.
[129:50.33]so
[130:19.96]Mysterious blue key.
[130:22.32]What are you doing with that?
[130:30.15]I got everything out of that.
[130:31.31]What do we do with the key?
[130:32.15]Oh, there's one more secret.
[130:55.00]Like, there's a bunch?
[131:03.28]I would've never figured that out.
[131:19.27]Am I gonna get a tuba?
[131:31.25]Wait, I just wanted you to give me the secret.
[131:47.46]I didn't want you to leave.
[132:11.78]Yeah, alright, you said that.
[132:49.02]should Bassmaster Ben not stop in stopping the story?
[132:52.77]should he not stop?
[132:58.29]yes not no
[133:16.96]The Toot Vessel and the Turd Vessel.
[133:25.40]Toot Master Tom.
[133:28.77]I feel like that's... I feel like that's like a hacker name in Dark Souls I get invaded by.
[133:32.81]That it's like, okay, he's gonna crash my computer.
[133:37.25]I gotta be careful.
[133:38.69]There's like fucking Toot Master Tom or like Turd Vessel Tom.
[134:02.73]Alright.
[134:03.09]Okay.
[134:18.49]I got the key, though.
[134:19.15]Can I put the key somewhere?
[134:23.01]Do you not want me to not repeat this full tale again, or should I not simply continue?
[134:27.61]Just tell me the answer.
[134:31.29]I don't even care.
[134:32.70]It's yes, right?
[134:49.31]Fill the vessel with turds.
[134:53.49]I don't have any turds.
[134:54.55]How do I get turds?
[135:04.55]I have to dust cards.
[135:07.11]Oh, really?
[135:08.53]Should I just turd everything?
[135:16.17]These things I have doubles of?
[135:28.02]This duplicate's okay.
[136:02.47]Okay, so I gotta get some more packs, right?
[136:05.43]Okay, cool.
[136:16.03]Any doubles?
[136:43.88]Do you have enough turrets?
[136:44.60]Yeah, but I'm going to need... I'm probably going to need to do it more than once, right?
[136:59.07]Only do it... I don't have to do it once?
[137:00.29]I don't know.
[137:13.77]Thanks for watching!
[137:44.80]Sound set in the club.
[137:46.14]I kind of need to do that.
[138:21.42]I'm just saying the amount of Omega lulls that I've seen in the last one straight minute.
[138:29.34]You tell me that my fart joke about farting, like this star-spangled banner or something, or like the fart thing with Holly, that I'm so lowbrow, apparently.
[138:45.09]Count the amount of omega-lols in the last one minute.
[139:18.59]I don't wanna hear it.
[139:19.71]I don't wanna hear it from anybody.
[139:22.65]I want... I want the... I want the mods to keep track of every chatter that Omegalulls in the next five minutes.
[139:30.14]I want you to keep track of every Omegalull you see in the next five minutes.
[139:40.32]And then time them out for an hour. ...
[139:54.19]Thank you.
[140:08.22]Thank you.
[140:38.19]Thank you.
[140:48.36]I don't know.
[140:50.30]I don't know.
[141:33.31]How many people are getting timed out?
[141:34.71]It was a lot.
[141:43.92]It was including Twitch staff.
[141:46.60]Oh.
[143:05.80]fatigue is setting in.
[144:11.24]Awww, okay.
[144:13.04]That was better.
[144:14.72]Alright.
[144:15.58]I only- I want enough to unlock all the turrets.
[144:49.12]Alright, let's do one more.
[144:50.29]Only one more.
[144:51.09]Just one more.
[144:51.67]One more, one more.
[144:52.25]Everyone relax for one more.
[145:41.35]Shut up, I did it perfect.
[146:21.99]Thank you.
[147:26.45]Boo!
[147:41.10]2.2 million dollars.
[147:42.25]Come on, that's gotta be better.
[147:47.29]It was a little bit better.
[147:47.99]Oh my god, I forgot to blink.
[147:52.35]Look at this.
[147:52.89]Holy shit.
[147:57.26]Jesus.
[148:01.18]Oh!
[148:06.60]Alright.
[148:07.86]What have we got?
[148:09.68]Do I have enough?
[148:30.49]I'm just going to sell a lot of these.
[148:32.21]Alright.
[148:38.25]What if I just sell all of them?
[149:11.03]I need 750, 750, which is what?
[149:12.03]1500?
[149:12.05]I need 1500.
[149:12.47]I'm close.
[149:12.81]I might just get it.
[149:43.72]Can we Omega Lola these turds?
[149:45.32]Yeah, that's fine.
[150:07.52]Okay, so what is it?
[150:41.49]Okay.
[150:47.93]That's pretty cool.
[150:52.99]You know what I really wish was in this game, and I know it's probably impossible, but... Because it would probably be so much money.
[150:59.36]But... Imagine this was licensed games.
[151:03.94]Not licensed games, licensed music.
[151:09.96]I feel like that would be really, really funny.
[151:11.48]It'd be really cool, I think.
[151:13.12]Not as funny as this!
[151:27.37]There are mods for custom songs?
[151:28.83]Alright, that's really cool.
[151:47.04]I have a blue key and a red key, so what do I do with the two keys?
[151:49.60]Okay, so I did everything with the turrets.
[151:59.25]Now you are ready.
[152:01.05]You will need a power level of 10 before combating the forces of order.
[152:06.41]Really?
[152:09.65]I have two keys now.
[152:14.66]How do I get...
[152:16.62]Shit.
[152:19.44]It's the candle as the last one.
[152:32.87]Oh shit.
[152:33.27]If you dare challenge me, prepare thyself, tromboner.
[152:48.00]Oh shit.
[152:48.50]What's going on?
[154:10.95]This puke is gonna come out of my mouth.
[154:45.55]You must yield the horn of legend.
[154:49.93]I must have a power level of at least 10.
[154:51.39]OK, so you have to come here with the legendary trombone.
[155:02.46]And.
[155:04.58]Beat it.
[155:04.86]OK, that's cool.
[155:08.07]I think I'm done.
[155:12.27]You gotta unlock everything.
[155:15.33]I don't know if I'm going to unlock everything.
[155:18.83]My god, it's got chills up my whole spine.
[155:21.04]You never turned baboons up in the options.
[155:26.80]Oh, I didn't.
[155:27.28]Yeah, that's true.
[155:30.26]Baboon quality inferno.
[155:33.50]Baboon preference.
[155:34.72]All of them.
[155:42.66]Let me see what that does.
[155:43.34]I'm just curious.
[155:48.42]What the fuck is this?
[155:49.38]Is there more songs?
[155:52.24]Is that a secret song?
[155:57.63]What was that?
[156:04.59]Where did that go?
[156:09.26]Where did that just go?
[156:17.98]If we go again.
[156:18.64]I'm not even playing.
[156:21.61]Alright, goodbye.
[156:47.95]That was a really cool game.
[156:48.97]Fun game.
[156:49.81]Liked it a lot.
[156:50.51]Very good.
[156:51.43]I would say it's a quality experience.
[156:54.01]Very fun.
[156:56.19]That was really cool.
[156:56.69]I liked it a lot.
[156:57.89]I'm glad I played it.
[156:59.52]Alright, now... Sorry, I slapped in your head.
[157:03.06]We're gonna play Breath of the Wild.
[157:04.92]I'm gonna go take a piss break.
[157:06.36]Make sure I get the Switch set up correctly.
[157:08.72]Back in like 2-3 minutes.
[157:09.56]See you soon.
[157:13.85]Be right back.
[157:18.81]Just kidding.
[157:19.25]Okay, now I'll be right back.
