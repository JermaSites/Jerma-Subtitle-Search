[00:41.38]Hey.
[00:42.82]How are you?
[00:47.40]And that's it.
[00:47.84]Alright.
[00:48.14]See you on Tuesday.
[00:50.14]Just wanted to really quickly just turn the stream on and say just hello.
[00:56.26]Just because of maintenance.
[00:56.96]Make sure you know what I'm doing today.
[00:58.28]I'm sitting here.
[00:59.25]I was playing a game.
[01:01.25]And I'm going to bed.
[01:03.63]Okay.
[01:04.29]Bye.
[01:07.13]What if I did that every day?
[01:08.41]What if I, okay, what if I just to make sure I could on like a marketing statement?
[01:12.35]So on my resume, right?
[01:14.77]The German 985 resume that I have that I send to companies.
[01:18.15]You know, I stream every single day 365.
[01:22.63]And if anybody wanted to come actually see if that was true, I don't know about that guy.
[01:26.62]I'm not sure if I believe that.
[01:29.78]They could just come here, they could just see that I was live every day.
[01:33.04]for an entire year straight.
[01:34.84]And I would just do this every day.
[01:36.42]And, of course, I would stream on my normal days.
[01:40.88]I'd get that job really quickly.
[01:43.88]Anyways, for real though, we are, uh, me and Talc's gonna play Monster Hunter again.
[01:47.90]It's... It's a good game.
[01:49.40]I really like it.
[01:50.00]I'm enjoying it.
[01:51.96]Monster Hunter World is what we're gonna continue.
[01:55.52]Don't know how much more of this game I'm gonna stream.
[02:00.99]I do like it a lot, so what you can probably expect is maybe an off-stream, kind of like this.
[02:12.40]Once a week, maybe, where you just kind of can see where I am at the moment.
[02:16.61]I'm gonna play it a lot off-stream, I think, too.
[02:19.11]So, maybe just check in with you.
[02:20.71]Maybe play it for a few hours every week.
[02:24.58]Not on the schedule anymore.
[02:27.25]So this is just going to be... Obviously, this is off schedule now.
[02:31.82]You're just getting an extra stream, I guess, this week of me playing Monster Hunter.
[02:38.62]Pokemon plus Dark Souls.
[02:40.50]That's actually a very accurate statement.
[02:44.04]So give me one second.
[02:45.00]I'm just going to make a quick tweet about this.
[02:47.75]And I'll see you guys in a minute.
[03:31.82]Okay.
[03:33.60]So we're just sort of waiting for Italics.
[03:35.84]He's also streaming too.
[03:39.16]He's just started as well.
[03:40.82]So once we see that he is available, we can poke him a little bit.
[03:47.52]In the meantime, thank you to BLV24 for the three bucks.
[03:52.24]I ended my banjo lesson to watch this.
[03:56.82]Hold on.
[03:57.36]You know how to play the banjo?
[03:58.70]You're taking a banjo lesson right now?
[04:03.67]That... Nice.
[04:05.75]Nice!
[04:08.05]You don't use a guitar pick for a banjo, right?
[04:09.71]Don't you use your fingernails?
[04:11.56]You use, like, the, you know, index finger, middle finger, ring finger.
[04:14.36]That's how you... Fingernails, right?
[04:15.94]You just kind of, like, pick at it.
[04:20.04]A deferral thanks to the $1.
[04:21.32]The bagpipes are the only way to play.
[04:24.02]I'm not playing with the bagpipes.
[04:27.18]I'm not playing with the support weapon.
[04:28.68]I'm not going to have any idea how to use it.
[04:31.96]It's just you do combos and buff the team.
[04:33.90]No.
[04:36.14]We're going back to the gun.
[04:38.40]Because I had enough to upgrade it again.
[04:41.50]And the upgrade is more damage than I can do with the blades, I think, at this point.
[04:45.56]So I upgraded it a third time.
[04:48.79]So I have a level 3 bone heavy gun bow.
[04:54.65]So we're going to use this for a little while.
[04:58.31]And, uh, so I'm just going to like unmute and just hopefully when it's Alex comes back, maybe he'll hear us in the meantime.
[05:08.06]Hey, would you look at that monster hunter?
[05:16.35]Let me move this out of the way.
[05:20.15]That looks good.
[05:20.97]That looks good.
[05:23.69]Okay.
[05:27.27]Jerma's the guy that never switches off DPS.
[05:32.11]There is only DPS in this game, unless you play with the guitar.
[05:37.95]If you take like the tuba guitar and maybe you start playing instruments and maybe... Wait, that's not true.
[05:44.88]I have healing shots.
[05:46.08]I've been playing support.
[05:47.26]I've healed italics like a bunch of times.
[05:52.83]So I am playing support sometimes with certain ammo types.
[05:57.61]I'm currently in the game with italics.
[05:58.93]He's just um He's doing his intro Here comes like the sound here comes the throttling I don't know what italics seems to be like the catalyst to the internet problems Maybe it's him So, you know, it's probably him that's causing all the issues Thank you to uh cvfd721 for the one dollar who do you main on overwatch?
[06:27.64]Well, I really haven't played Overwatch in about a year.
[06:30.06]So, but it was Roadhog.
[06:32.18]Like a year ago.
[06:35.95]There's your answer.
[06:36.53]That answer provided by CDFD.
[06:38.95]Let me unplug this controller because I think it's charged now.
[06:42.59]Let's pet the pig because everyone's going to tell me to pet the pig and the pig is going to get mad at me.
[06:48.85]He's Bitcoin mining.
[06:54.45]Thank you to Ewert20.
[06:57.47]Twerty twerp for the $1 German I was wondering if you could help me I've played minecraft for a few months, but I still I can't figure out how to work the piston doors You could do a tutorial or something.
[07:08.36]That would be great.
[07:09.08]Thanks Well, I'm not I'm that's not gonna happen And speaking of thinking of like boy, I said what's italics doing on his stream right now Is he is this stream like running
[07:29.82]I can show you guys my gear.
[07:31.66]I can do a gear breakdown if you want while we wait for him.
[07:36.78]I took off the walnut.
[07:37.64]The walnut wasn't really good for me.
[07:41.15]If I make the whole thing, maybe I'll put the walnut back on.
[07:46.15]But for now, I don't think I'm going to use it.
[07:53.53]Minecraft.
[07:55.25]I'm never going to play Minecraft ever again.
[07:57.87]For the rest of my life.
[08:01.41]I can say that with the utmost certainty.
[08:07.17]Let's see.
[08:07.69]Change equipment.
[08:10.16]So here I put the Wind Charm.
[08:11.78]I got the pre-order bonus item on that I never had on the entire time we played yesterday.
[08:18.38]But there's Bone Shooter 3.
[08:21.30]The other weapons that I've upgraded that I really have access to that I would like to use are these.
[08:28.35]and I have this too an iron hammer two so let's do the dual blade everyone nobody knows why I just did that talk again one two two testing one one two one two three one two three one two three one two three okay okay are you ready to start playing this game that we like to play sometimes
[08:54.85]I am.
[08:55.39]I was just making sure that I knew how to use this new weapon.
[09:00.68]Oh, yeah.
[09:01.28]I like this new weapon.
[09:02.20]My new weapon.
[09:04.46]Alright, so what are you playing with today?
[09:06.78]I'm doing the heavy gun bow.
[09:07.72]Okay.
[09:09.24]I upgraded it to level 3 bone.
[09:11.22]Level 3, so might as well use it.
[09:13.24]I only have bone level 2 and I'm playing with a switch axe today.
[09:16.22]Hey, you know what's funny about the switch axe?
[09:20.78]Just a joke?
[09:22.08]No, that was my first choice.
[09:25.69]So do you want the Switch X?
[09:26.97]No, no, no.
[09:27.55]We're doing like a little... This is like the developer commentary.
[09:30.29]This is like the director commentary.
[09:32.56]Yeah, this is before, you know, before the stream.
[09:35.14]So that was my first choice, funny enough.
[09:37.06]And now it's Alex.
[09:38.24]He's the one using it.
[09:38.96]Isn't that funny?
[09:39.60]Hey, you know what?
[09:40.34]We both have great taste.
[09:42.72]That's all I can say.
[09:44.37]What was your first choice?
[09:46.17]My first choice was the charged sword.
[09:48.93]And that was what I'm using now.
[09:52.58]Right, of course.
[09:55.12]The hardest weapon in the game.
[09:59.30]The most complicated one.
[10:01.28]I'm currently loading back into... Good one.
[10:06.82]But no, but with the charge sword, you can... It's kind of a misnomer, right?
[10:11.08]Because you don't just charge the sword.
[10:12.46]You also charge the shield.
[10:15.55]That is true.
[10:16.01]All right, hold on.
[10:17.19]I got to do something real quick.
[10:19.85]Everyone's like... Are you in the game?
[10:22.37]Yeah, I'm in the game.
[10:23.27]Just post a quest when you're in.
[10:24.55]I will post a quest.
[10:25.59]What would you like to do?
[10:26.95]Let's do an investigation.
[10:29.05]Okay.
[10:32.11]Let me pick up... We'll actually already have one in the Wild Spire Waste.
[10:37.44]Would you like to hunt the Kulu Yaku?
[10:40.78]Sure thing.
[10:41.48]I would love to hunt that thing.
[10:45.20]We fail if you faint one time.
[10:47.92]So this is a no death challenge.
[10:51.16]You think I'm gonna lose?
[10:51.86]I'm not gonna lose.
[10:52.40]For a gold reward.
[10:55.78]I'm ready.
[10:57.48]I'm ready to do it.
[10:59.56]Write it down on the board.
[11:01.46]It's on the board.
[11:02.48]It's on the board.
[11:04.30]No quests have been posted.
[11:05.35]Why?
[11:06.59]It's currently saving data and then backing me out.
[11:09.41]And quest has been accepted.
[11:10.71]Okay.
[11:11.19]There it is.
[11:11.65]Investigations.
[11:12.31]Hunting investigation.
[11:13.29]Do not die.
[11:14.07]Where are you going?
[11:15.77]Southwest camp?
[11:17.11]Yeah.
[11:17.37]Southwest camp.
[11:18.27]Okay.
[11:18.51]I think a northeast one.
[11:19.97]I don't know.
[11:20.25]I always go back to the one that we start with for some reason.
[11:25.15]All right.
[11:25.59]Give me one second.
[11:26.47]I have accepted.
[11:27.23]I am now standby for departure.
[11:28.95]Standby.
[11:29.75]Right.
[11:30.03]And then we'll load in.
[11:32.41]Okay.
[11:32.73]So I'm going to stop this at the very beginning of the stream.
[11:39.04]Can you guys hear this?
[11:40.88]No, of course you can't.
[11:42.68]Never mind.
[11:43.46]I'm playing a fucking Minecraft piston door tutorial and it won't even pump through my speakers because I'm on PS4.
[11:49.12]Because it's all fucked up and I can't put it through OBS.
[11:51.37]Just know that I clicked on how to make a piston door in Minecraft 1.1.
[11:54.83]I tried.
[11:56.45]I tried.
[12:03.09]Right on back.
[12:07.63]I'm ready to go.
[12:11.29]And thank you, Combine, for the $1.
[12:13.07]Also, have you ever listened to the band Tool?
[12:15.00]What's your favorite band, bro?
[12:17.02]My favorite band is probably the Gorillaz.
[12:18.82]But, yes, I've... I have... Wow, that was in sync right there.
[12:24.26]I have seen how the pieces fit.
[12:25.82]Because, you know, I did watch them... We both flew down simultaneously.
[12:28.36]I did watch them fall away.
[12:30.42]I like that band.
[12:31.02]Oops, not that button.
[12:32.66]I always want to push that button for gestures because...
[12:36.62]That's how it is in Dark Souls.
[12:37.76]We should eat first if we can't die.
[12:39.68]That is true.
[12:40.74]If we don't want to lose.
[12:42.18]Yes.
[12:42.76]We should get more stamina.
[12:45.85]Okay, canteen.
[12:47.03]I didn't do an oven roast, so I'm just going to pay with money.
[12:49.91]How long does it take?
[12:54.13]Well, this takes research points, doesn't it?
[12:58.33]Mushroom.
[12:58.83]Does it give research points, or does it consume research points?
[13:03.56]It looks like... Is that what the green points are?
[13:06.62]They cost points.
[13:08.33]And over item and 60 points to order.
[13:11.19]But depending on what you give her, you can get bronze, silver, or gold results.
[13:17.75]I'm going to do defense.
[13:20.09]Sushi fish scales.
[13:22.77]So this is like why you should fish with what I'm seeing.
[13:27.32]That makes sense.
[13:29.58]Okay, I'm going to cook my whetstone fish then.
[13:35.12]Yeah, we're going on Saturday.
[13:35.92]And I just got some rations.
[13:38.58]Let's eat some of those.
[13:39.52]I'll have the blue mushroom pie with some jagras hide, please.
[13:43.03]That sounds delicious.
[13:46.59]That sounds pretty good.
[13:49.37]So what's the time on this one?
[13:53.18]Can you stack rations with the food that you eat, or is it the same thing?
[13:57.66]I don't know.
[13:59.24]That is a great question.
[14:00.82]Because the more stamina we have, the better.
[14:04.99]It's possible.
[14:06.65]I'm not entirely sure.
[14:08.91]Okay.
[14:10.67]So, I don't know what the time limit is.
[14:11.95]How do you check the active?
[14:14.15]And look at the lower right.
[14:15.51]48 minutes.
[14:17.14]Or the top left, I believe, that clock.
[14:19.70]Okay.
[14:21.18]If that gets to the red marker, then sorry, you lose.
[14:25.24]You lost the game show.
[14:26.52]So, yes, you can stack a regular meal and the ration, apparently.
[14:31.77]Okay, that's cool.
[14:33.04]So if you just ate, you might want to also eat a ration.
[14:39.14]Well, slam face first in this cactus.
[14:42.04]Give me that ration.
[14:45.52]Cool.
[14:48.12]Also, if you have nutrients, how long do nutrients last?
[14:52.08]Can we figure that out?
[14:53.24]I think all buffs last for the duration of your mission.
[14:55.97]Okay.
[14:58.06]Or until you lose.
[15:00.64]So you might have to like craft more if you really want to keep using them.
[15:04.34]I see.
[15:05.80]Why am I using the gun again?
[15:06.70]Did I just go, I see.
[15:10.78]That was just like a very, that was my mind just making sure you're aware.
[15:14.88]By the way, here he is.
[15:18.13]Oh, I guess we found him.
[15:19.77]Found him.
[15:20.85]Expert hunting.
[15:21.61]He's coming through.
[15:23.73]We're really good at hunting.
[15:25.39]Yes.
[15:26.97]You know, that's why I made sure to bait that meat that I put, you know, in my backpack before, so he would just be lured right to us.
[15:33.91]Actually, isn't his nest right here?
[15:36.17]It might be.
[15:36.59]So should I just shotgun him in the head?
[15:37.95]I want to try picking up his egg and then dropping it right in front of him.
[15:42.86]It might work.
[15:47.54]I'm running away with his... You have his egg.
[15:49.94]There it is.
[15:51.30]He's currently over here at his egg's nest.
[15:53.68]He's looking around suspiciously.
[15:55.48]No, he picked up an egg.
[15:57.19]He picked up an egg.
[15:58.31]I think he's stealing eggs.
[16:00.43]Yeah, this is like a weasel.
[16:01.39]Oh, these are not his eggs.
[16:03.33]No.
[16:04.65]He was just completely content with you doing that because he's also doing the same thing.
[16:08.13]He used you as a distraction.
[16:11.50]That's a great idea.
[16:12.66]Now he's going to run back to his nest with this and eat it.
[16:15.90]That's exactly what's going to happen.
[16:16.98]All right, but what if we set a... Do we have any traps?
[16:20.20]Because we could totally just set a trap in his nest and one-shot him.
[16:24.46]I think he needs to be hurt to step in the trap and have it work.
[16:31.07]I don't know.
[16:31.47]I think you can like... If you use the shock trap, I think it does...
[16:36.30]A lot.
[16:37.44]But I could be wrong.
[16:38.90]I saw a video earlier of a guy, you know that like the alligator that we were fighting yesterday?
[16:43.96]He's like full health alligator, set up a shock trap right in the middle.
[16:48.38]The alligator like touched it and instantly won the quest.
[16:53.34]No fighting required.
[16:56.66]I think you have to beat them up at least a little bit so they like start limping around.
[17:00.69]Alright, here we go.
[17:01.37]Let's see what he does here.
[17:04.68]All right.
[17:05.52]Let's have him at least enjoy a last meal, right?
[17:07.38]Mm-hmm.
[17:09.08]All right.
[17:09.32]I think he's going to eat... Does he eat the whole thing yet?
[17:12.64]You ready?
[17:13.02]Yeah.
[17:14.99]No.
[17:15.25]Don't let him enjoy it.
[17:16.53]Don't kill him.
[17:16.93]I hate that it auto-puts up my weapon.
[17:18.37]Let's change that.
[17:23.25]Okay.
[17:23.71]He dropped it.
[17:24.71]So that was the opportunity to go in.
[17:27.71]I mean, it was.
[17:28.94]It's not a better opportunity.
[17:31.18]I guess this is his nest.
[17:33.46]Apparently...
[17:36.59]Watch out.
[17:36.93]This is the jumper.
[17:37.63]Is this the one that digs up the rock?
[17:39.35]Yeah, he's the rock guy.
[17:40.59]Let's just go ahead and do it now.
[17:47.99]Might as well have it.
[17:50.72]Be careful.
[17:51.12]I'm about to snipe him.
[17:51.94]Come on.
[17:55.10]Make it back up.
[17:57.52]Did that not get him?
[17:58.22]I think that was coming.
[17:59.02]It did.
[17:59.18]Shouldn't have reloaded there.
[18:05.29]All right, can you cut his tail off?
[18:08.02]I really do wonder.
[18:08.68]Where's my slicing?
[18:09.86]You'd think that the monsters, I mean, that you'd be able to take off different body parts, but maybe they just come off in the heat of combat.
[18:17.68]Apparently, I brought my cat with me.
[18:22.25]I would assume.
[18:22.83]I kind of forgot about him.
[18:25.41]That's doing a lot of damage.
[18:27.57]How did that do that?
[18:31.12]Oh, it's your explosive.
[18:32.22]Yeah, it's my little slicer ammo.
[18:34.74]It's like a little shock.
[18:37.70]Ow.
[18:38.40]Damage was reduced.
[18:39.34]I wonder why.
[18:41.90]What about the head?
[18:46.25]What about his eye?
[18:47.07]What about his neck?
[18:50.79]The tail is fine.
[18:52.41]It's doing a lot of damage.
[18:53.71]Just get some mid-combat bees.
[18:57.75]Got it right in the tip.
[19:02.76]I wish I could throw these.
[19:04.74]Ow.
[19:09.36]Oh, your cat is here.
[19:10.52]Were you aware of that?
[19:11.42]I know, that's what I said, yeah.
[19:13.54]Being a distraction, I didn't mean to bring him.
[19:15.63]Apparently, if we go to the research station... Sometimes he just sneaks along for the ride.
[19:19.21]There's a book at the research station that shows you what can actually be broken off of the animal.
[19:24.33]Really?
[19:24.77]That's cool.
[19:26.39]So that's the whole point of getting all the extra...
[19:30.60]All the, like, sniffing the footprints and finding the writing on the wall.
[19:35.61]Oh, my God.
[19:36.49]Who are you shooting at?
[19:37.19]I'm trying to reload this thing.
[19:38.59]My brain, like, is... I was trying to, like, reload it.
[19:48.84]Fall, fall, fall.
[19:52.28]You know what?
[19:52.78]I don't even know how to reload the weapon unless it's empty.
[19:54.80]All right, give me one sec.
[19:59.11]I have no idea.
[20:00.81]Where'd he go?
[20:01.25]Does anyone know?
[20:04.93]So I don't have to stop and look it up.
[20:06.63]How do you just reload the gun without having to shoot all the bullets?
[20:09.66]It's some combination.
[20:10.60]I know it is.
[20:11.02]He's down there.
[20:17.22]Where the hell did he go?
[20:19.24]How old is Italics?
[20:20.14]Italics is 41.
[20:20.92]He just turned 41.
[20:32.49]Look in the top right.
[20:33.41]Let me see here.
[20:38.67]Aim, fire.
[20:39.39]Alright, so it's L2 and triangle to reload.
[20:46.20]Good to know.
[20:49.57]Say reload three times.
[20:50.79]Reload, reload, reload.
[21:02.80]To reload, press the PS button.
[21:06.10]I want them to make a game that something as crucial as, like, reloading your weapon is... Like, you have to press the PS button, like, five times within one second.
[21:17.38]Like, one, two, three, four, five!
[21:19.55]Uh, to reload the gun.
[21:21.03]Oh my god.
[21:21.85]Shut up, lady.
[21:39.67]be horrifying.
[21:41.51]That would be fucking terrible.
[21:42.81]Let's use this.
[21:51.23]Oops.
[21:52.34]Well, that's how you do damage, apparently.
[21:53.90]Let's just do it again.
[22:02.30]Alright, italics, I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm about to make an explosion in front of us.
[22:12.34]And guess what?
[22:13.34]I'm gonna do it again!
[22:16.56]Out of range.
[22:17.72]He apparently turned his body, and apparently that made him out of range.
[22:29.45]Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.
[22:35.18]Oh no, my soundboard crashed.
[22:43.94]I like the slicing ammo.
[22:46.02]It's very good.
[22:50.46]Just stick it on him.
[22:54.78]Is this game on PC?
[22:56.10]Not yet.
[22:56.66]It will be though, eventually.
[23:00.59]In the somewhat future, who knows when that is.
[23:02.53]That's the one thing about PC, man.
[23:06.29]It really does suck.
[23:09.17]knowing that they have this platform that everybody knows it's gonna be on it's like the gta 5 scenario where it says yeah we're gonna make a pc version I don't know you'll see it whatever it's only it's only just like you know the most powerful best platform to put anything on but you know you'll see at some point who knows who cares
[23:36.22]Is it like a March or something?
[23:37.87]April?
[23:38.45]May?
[23:39.01]I don't know.
[23:41.73]Red Dead Redemption?
[23:42.55]Yeah.
[23:44.77]Comes out on PC in the fall.
[23:46.21]Wow, that's fucking... That's a long time from now.
[23:56.79]Here he comes.
[23:57.35]You gonna jump?
[23:59.18]No, he's gonna duck.
[24:02.16]Now he's coming for me, alright.
[24:07.03]Oh no, it shattered and it made him angry.
[24:08.79]There he goes again.
[24:13.45]He's almost dead.
[24:21.24]You know, and here's the weird thing about GTA 5 and Monster Hunter.
[24:26.41]I bought GTA V again.
[24:29.67]I bought GTA V twice.
[24:31.21]No, three times because of the other remade version they did on the, like, PS4 and Xbox One.
[24:39.61]Dude, my stamina is just shitting the bed.
[24:42.19]Like, at all times.
[24:42.97]Hey, sorry.
[24:46.31]Where'd you go?
[24:46.87]You disappeared.
[24:48.58]I had to talk to someone in the chat.
[24:50.84]You had to talk to somebody?
[24:52.34]Yeah.
[24:52.76]Okay, cool.
[24:55.25]also I was still helping though no you were I'm doing lots of damage I'm just I'm just kind of like talking I'm just like we're talking about like pc games uh okay like such as
[25:08.77]We're talking about why companies decide to do this thing where they come out with the PC version.
[25:14.15]Like, offensively far out from the console version.
[25:18.85]I don't think it's decide so much as it is, like, Capcom knows they make most of their money on console.
[25:26.63]I know, but that long, it's supposed to be what, fall?
[25:30.24]I mean, like, look at Rockstar.
[25:32.98]Exactly, we were just talking about that too.
[25:35.12]Who's the real villain here, you know?
[25:37.02]They're all villains.
[25:40.39]Who's the real villain?
[25:41.71]Red Dead Redemption on PC.
[25:46.17]Who's the real villain here?
[25:47.39]That is pretty villainous.
[25:48.91]What if you only make PC games, but then you forget how?
[25:52.33]This is true.
[25:52.91]Alright, drop that rock.
[26:03.76]I know, the rock is throwing up all of my combos.
[26:10.85]That stupid little... Oh, come on.
[26:12.25]Right when I get away.
[26:14.03]He times it so perfectly.
[26:15.61]This guy is a pro.
[26:20.81]Here he comes.
[26:24.63]Alright, he finally dropped the rocket.
[26:28.59]He doesn't need it.
[26:31.19]Apparently not.
[26:36.21]I would have been very upset at that decision.
[26:38.24]Nice.
[26:42.54]I got to get my eyes.
[26:44.60]Missed my combo.
[26:49.90]He's got to be almost dead.
[26:51.86]He's definitely dead in a second here.
[26:56.35]Whoops.
[26:56.75]Yeah, I'm doing way better with this.
[27:07.50]Nice shots.
[27:08.36]You really stagger him if you hit him in the face, it seems like.
[27:11.31]Yeah.
[27:11.71]At least there's a chance to stagger if you hit him in the face.
[27:13.89]All right.
[27:17.63]I'm leaving Cat at home next time.
[27:18.93]It just makes it too much chasing.
[27:23.65]There he goes.
[27:31.18]Oh, I got Infinity for sliding.
[27:41.60]Scroll, scroll, scroll.
[27:46.80]How does that last?
[27:50.88]Hey, excuse me.
[27:51.58]Why do you have a defensive line with him?
[27:53.48]He's got the football in his hand.
[27:54.71]That guy was just trying to block me.
[27:58.17]I think he's going back to where he got the egg the first time.
[28:00.75]Fumble the fucking football.
[28:05.73]Come back over here, why don't you?
[28:10.56]Oh, he's dead.
[28:11.93]All done.
[28:13.73]All done.
[28:14.11]Make sure you skin him before your time is up.
[28:16.19]Yes.
[28:18.29]Poor guy.
[28:19.07]Just cut off his head.
[28:30.53]So.
[28:36.03]Yes.
[28:37.35]I think.
[28:40.22]I like the ranged weapons.
[28:41.58]I really love, like, shooting and aiming and stuff.
[28:43.54]It's, I mean, but... The problem that I have with the dual blades is the dual blades are just, they're kind of boring.
[28:50.93]You just, like, spin around in a circle and flail everywhere.
[28:53.93]I'd rather, like... Well, maybe you should get one of the more technical melee weapons.
[28:57.33]I'm gonna try the hammer.
[28:58.79]Like, after we're done with this.
[28:59.97]Okay.
[29:00.13]Not right now.
[29:01.21]It's a good weapon.
[29:02.19]Looks really fun, but, uh... Not technical.
[29:04.88]Okay, maybe it is.
[29:06.62]I don't know.
[29:07.70]It looks kind of like what I'm doing, where you can just, I like my weapon because I can swing wildly.
[29:15.74]Induce spin attacks.
[29:17.28]Have I tried the boat?
[29:19.02]Kind of in training, not really though.
[29:24.00]Okay, what did we get?
[29:26.60]What did we get for doing that?
[29:27.58]The special reward, we got the, whatever's in the gold box at the bottom is like the investigation reward.
[29:36.35]And then you get money.
[29:40.25]Which we kind of really need.
[29:44.56]I got three hide for my special.
[29:49.92]No, I'm not going to use the hunting horn.
[29:52.86]What if we just both use the hunting horn?
[29:55.52]Then we would lose every fight.
[29:57.55]It would just take forever.
[29:58.45]We could just keep buffing each other.
[29:59.73]Plus defense.
[30:00.09]Plus defense.
[30:03.17]Plus defense.
[30:06.22]So now, what, do you want to just look around?
[30:07.84]I want to upgrade my weapon before we go do the next story thing.
[30:13.66]Or we can keep looking around for, like, a monster that we haven't hunted here.
[30:17.84]Because this is, like, the free roam area.
[30:20.77]But whenever we go back, I want to, like, upgrade my gear before we take on the next huge... Yeah, if I'm going to try the hammer out, I'm going to need to upgrade it once or twice.
[30:30.91]That's for sure.
[30:31.49]All right, so, like, we haven't really explored this region yet.
[30:37.98]So what monsters can we find here that we can kill just in the open world?
[30:46.94]Take a look at the old map.
[30:47.88]We can just go take a look.
[30:49.82]Well, it would be under endemic life if we've already tracked them.
[30:52.58]So first we have to kind of find some synths and some footprints and stuff.
[30:57.62]Let's just go and explore.
[31:00.84]Let's be exploration people.
[31:04.19]Because we really haven't done any free roam.
[31:07.69]Period.
[31:11.28]Good dodges.
[31:13.04]Are you serious?
[31:14.66]They're zigzagging, man.
[31:16.24]Why?
[31:17.16]Why did you stop?
[31:19.36]They think they're far enough away.
[31:20.64]That's as far as the leash goes.
[31:23.61]I'm not even going to shoot you again.
[31:26.67]You deserve to live.
[31:33.80]Is he just going to mortally wound them?
[31:35.12]What is this guy, collecting ants?
[31:37.20]I think, I don't know.
[31:38.02]Okay, yes, they actually are carrier ants.
[31:44.05]That guy just did the Speedy Gonzales at the end of every Speedy Gonzales cartoon.
[31:50.03]Okay, um... I have to capture nine ants.
[31:55.37]Look at this majestic fucking being.
[31:58.02]Ooh, I better use the net.
[31:59.42]Oh, wait!
[32:00.00]You're right!
[32:04.84]Let's capture this.
[32:05.57]It's a giant dragonfly.
[32:06.59]Why would I not want this?
[32:11.01]What is it?
[32:12.91]Ooh.
[32:14.83]I'm making an ant colony, alright?
[32:16.47]This is the ant colony game now.
[32:19.68]I don't care about monsters anymore.
[32:21.32]I just want an ant colony for my room.
[32:26.08]Oh, no.
[32:27.12]We have to have the most boring streams possible.
[32:29.12]So that means, like, let's just go pick up bugs.
[32:31.21]Look, I'm going to capture my ants, and I'm going to enjoy it.
[32:35.23]I know.
[32:36.11]You don't have to do it.
[32:37.53]No, no, no.
[32:39.35]That's not me being facetious.
[32:40.63]I'm saying, like, that sounds like a lot of fun to me.
[32:43.97]You don't have any constraints?
[32:44.85]Holy shit, you're right.
[32:45.39]So we don't have to be on the same screen.
[32:47.28]I can go this way?
[33:00.79]What the- holy shi- oh wait, how far away are you?
[33:03.59]Are you sure this is gonna work?
[33:06.03]I- because I'm- is this not like a glitch or anything, right?
[33:08.17]Like how far away are you right now?
[33:13.65]How's that possible?
[33:14.55]We're not on the same screen!
[33:16.73]I don't know man, this is like fucking- this is too much for me, right?
[33:23.16]I don't know if I can do this.
[33:25.70]What if I just like fucking start puking, because like I couldn't- like how would you even handle that in the first place?
[33:31.25]It's a... Wait, we're gonna... Hold on.
[33:34.67]You guys didn't think we were gonna get a fucking bug stream.
[33:37.05]Nope, I didn't wanna... No, pick him up.
[33:41.79]No, just... Alright, got him.
[33:43.48]I actually have a quest for this.
[33:45.22]There's a quest for everything in this game.
[33:49.74]Ah, shit.
[33:50.44]Almost got him.
[33:51.10]Shit.
[33:51.38]Thought I was lying.
[33:52.62]I got a quest for mushrooms, too.
[33:54.78]And wait, I can hear him, too?
[33:55.93]Yeah, I can hear you talking.
[33:57.64]Oh no, my item pouch is full.
[33:59.52]Hold on a second.
[34:00.92]Are you in my house right now?
[34:03.74]Well, I'm actually in your ear, tickling it.
[34:06.84]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[34:08.60]Are you inside of my house?
[34:11.28]Why can I hear you talk?
[34:13.54]Am I still inside your house?
[34:14.97]I don't understand, but I can hear you in my ear.
[34:17.63]Are you in my head?
[34:19.39]How did you get in here?
[34:21.82]You bring this technology back to like the fucking Middle Ages.
[34:23.71]You pick me up from the airport.
[34:25.11]Yeah, bring this technology back to the Middle Ages and convince a king to do something fucking crazy.
[34:30.90]You know, just be on, just get him into team speak and put headphones in his ears.
[34:35.16]And he'll be like, holy shit, what's happening?
[34:37.46]It'd just be like, it's me.
[34:38.48]They would probably burn you.
[34:40.08]No, no, no, no, you just influence me.
[34:41.20]They would kill you.
[34:42.24]They would kill who?
[34:43.36]They would kill you.
[34:44.56]This would be magic to them.
[34:46.80]Yeah.
[34:46.92]Like, they would think you were a witch or sorcerer, and they would kill you.
[34:50.16]Yeah, but then you could just make sure they didn't, so you'd be like, by the way, if I die, you die too, because I'm in your head.
[34:55.34]And he'd be like, oh shit, I gotta let him live then, I can't die.
[34:59.03]I have so much red meat to eat on a bone!
[35:06.33]My liege, shoe on head, all pre-recorded.
[35:11.53]I found a... I found the slime monster, by the way.
[35:15.55]You found the slime monster.
[35:17.68]I have a problem where my pack is full.
[35:20.56]So, if I go to the camp, do they have a chest at camp where you can dump
[35:26.37]Maybe, but Muddy the Mudskipper is now looking at me and he's very angry with me.
[35:31.29]Or do you have to go all the way back home?
[35:33.10]I don't know, Talix.
[35:37.26]Should I engage or should I abstain?
[35:39.62]From the slime monster?
[35:40.82]Slime monster is right here.
[35:42.98]Over in the slime swamp.
[35:44.88]I will come to you as soon as I dump my pack.
[35:46.82]I did find that you can go inside the tent and dump your stuff.
[35:52.09]Is there an auto button, though?
[35:54.86]What is my cat doing?
[35:56.46]Excite a shroom.
[35:58.50]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:00.38]He's hostile now.
[36:02.32]Wait, why did I just kick that bug?
[36:03.68]Apparently that was really important for me to kick the fucking bug.
[36:10.02]Well, I have apparently engaged, so... I can run away.
[36:15.18]Or I could engage.
[36:16.02]You know what?
[36:23.74]Let's just shoot him.
[36:28.64]What do we got?
[36:29.02]Sticky ammo.
[36:31.82]Wow.
[36:34.78]Wait, this is one- this one's gonna, like, use my ghillie suit.
[36:46.62]Try out your ghillie suit, Jeremy.
[36:48.20]I ain't getting caught up here.
[36:53.52]He's gonna dive.
[36:54.26]Oh no, not these stupid monster bugs.
[37:00.71]Excuse me, Mr. Monster Bug.
[37:03.11]Alright, I will be coming to you shortly.
[37:07.27]In the eye.
[37:09.31]Blink.
[37:11.78]I don't really have... Oh, you are too slow.
[37:14.58]Oof!
[37:21.12]This guy can close gaps really quickly.
[37:22.70]My cat is spazzing.
[37:25.90]Cat?
[37:26.78]Yeah, like I'm in my tent, my cat is doing jumping jacks, dancing, and having a seizure.
[37:36.01]I thought you were talking about like you had a cat, like an actual cat.
[37:38.87]No, I don't have a cat.
[37:39.93]I'm allergic to cats, remember?
[37:42.23]Oh, yeah.
[37:43.03]Why would I have a cat?
[37:44.07]I don't know.
[37:45.57]Fun?
[37:49.42]Just to masochistically torture myself.
[37:56.35]No, I went right into the mud.
[37:57.33]It's poo.
[37:59.86]Alright, I think I wanna... I gotta get set up.
[38:02.92]Let's see if I can get it to work.
[38:16.04]It's going to be hard.
[38:18.04]Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to be able to stand still for this dude.
[38:20.87]Alright, I'm coming back.
[38:21.63]Let me try.
[38:23.89]Oh my lord, what's happening?
[38:25.89]There I go.
[38:26.61]I can't move.
[38:27.51]I can't move.
[38:28.13]Is that true?
[38:29.55]It was true.
[38:34.35]I'm coming to help you.
[38:41.70]Out of range.
[38:43.82]I have to swim to you, apparently.
[38:50.32]Come on, hurry up!
[38:51.36]Come on!
[38:52.16]Come on!
[38:52.86]No, no, no, not you, me!
[38:55.31]I'm almost there.
[38:56.93]Oh, wow.
[38:57.57]Oh, this guy?
[38:58.47]Yeah.
[38:59.25]Okay.
[38:59.39]Dude, I killed him faster than last time.
[39:04.67]Probably.
[39:10.95]Okay, we'll hit it.
[39:11.57]Alright.
[39:13.72]Where is he?
[39:14.54]Where is he?
[39:14.92]Underneath the water.
[39:16.24]Alright, that was...
[39:20.38]That was pretty deceiving.
[39:21.91]He's not underneath the water anymore.
[39:30.63]He doesn't really hold still for very long.
[39:32.67]No.
[39:33.91]I only have a level 2 weapon as well, so that's gonna make this a little harder.
[39:40.46]Should've brought a shock trap or something.
[39:42.00]Oh no.
[39:42.24]This is the exact guy I was talking about.
[39:45.54]This does seem like a good guy to do it on.
[39:49.00]Just put it up on the mud.
[39:51.98]Right in his, like, head fins.
[39:54.26]Right in the fins.
[39:57.78]All right.
[39:59.36]Where is it?
[39:59.74]He's running?
[40:01.13]He's on the run.
[40:03.53]You got scared of that sweet combo I just did.
[40:05.73]Wow, you really do have... That is a really nice-looking weapon.
[40:14.14]Oh, thank you.
[40:14.72]I made it myself.
[40:15.40]It looks like a... Handcrafted in the forge.
[40:20.20]Alright, well, let's follow this dude.
[40:22.58]Make sure he doesn't get away.
[40:26.29]Uh, one step ahead of you.
[40:29.43]No, no, no, no, you're not one step ahead.
[40:31.21]You're like, actually, you are one full step ahead.
[40:34.20]You are a step ahead of me.
[40:35.42]One full step ahead.
[40:36.30]One actual step.
[40:39.34]Alright, there he is.
[40:40.96]Alright.
[40:41.24]He's lathering around.
[40:42.24]Get him in my sights, Captain!
[40:47.65]Where are you?
[40:48.25]He now has leg armor and back armor.
[40:53.05]Did he evolve?
[40:54.29]What is this?
[40:55.09]Why did that... Hold on.
[40:55.65]It wasn't telling me that it was out of range.
[40:57.85]I just shot it.
[40:58.43]It was in range.
[40:59.30]Apparently it wasn't.
[40:59.96]Did I hit the ground?
[41:00.66]I don't... Do that lie down thing.
[41:07.72]It was a nice try.
[41:08.64]It was a nice try.
[41:09.42]I gotta hit him with it.
[41:10.30]I'm gonna go ahead and whetstone.
[41:12.29]How did that miss?
[41:13.15]I should have right in the fucking head.
[41:17.13]You're good.
[41:17.53]You're well hidden.
[41:19.01]If you need to hide, duck into the brush.
[41:22.15]What is he doing?
[41:22.99]This is when he rolls around and he's getting mud all over him and he's just fucking the whole place up.
[41:28.44]I just cleaned this room.
[41:33.56]I just cleaned it.
[41:35.22]Oh, what?
[41:35.62]Don't worry, I'll be there momentarily.
[41:40.73]What is that?
[41:42.16]Oh, oh, there's about to be a Jurassic Park fight going on here.
[41:46.95]Oh, no.
[41:48.33]Don't even tell me.
[41:48.99]They're fighting each other.
[41:53.39]Wait, what the hell?
[41:55.35]What is going on right now?
[41:57.31]Why is this happening?
[41:58.31]This is fucking crazy.
[41:59.81]It is crazy.
[42:00.79]He's like, all right, let's watch.
[42:02.43]He's dead.
[42:02.75]Let's just watch.
[42:06.16]This is way better than Middle Earth Shadow of War, like fighting your guy versus the other guy.
[42:11.64]Wait, is he running?
[42:12.82]What's happening?
[42:15.42]They're roaring at each other still.
[42:17.40]I think we're good.
[42:18.04]Just stay calm.
[42:18.72]Are we good?
[42:19.62]Don't shoot anything?
[42:20.16]Don't shoot the other guy.
[42:21.24]Well, no, he's running away.
[42:22.76]This one's back for more.
[42:25.78]Don't shoot.
[42:28.28]He bit off more than he could chew earlier.
[42:29.86]He's like throwing it all up now.
[42:31.11]That was insane.
[42:32.23]That was insane.
[42:32.73]That was absolutely...
[42:38.82]They did the thing in every cartoon where two people fight and like the tumbleweed dust cloud shows up He's back, he's back, he's back He's back for revenge
[43:03.08]Oh, get him in the stomach while we have a chance.
[43:05.76]Ah, shit.
[43:06.16]He's gone.
[43:09.10]He's leaving.
[43:09.42]He just comes in for like a strafing run and then leaves.
[43:12.10]Also, the little piranhas are noticing us now.
[43:14.90]They're both fighting over the swamp.
[43:16.39]They want to like roll around in the mud.
[43:21.99]Where'd he go?
[43:26.23]Where is he?
[43:27.07]So hard.
[43:27.41]He's right here next to you.
[43:30.09]I'm spitting mud at you.
[43:31.16]I can't close the gap.
[43:32.84]I know.
[43:33.18]It's so hard to close the gap with this guy.
[43:34.60]Because as soon as I get here, he goes back under and starts swimming again.
[43:39.60]And by the time I get in range to shoot him... What if my guys run over?
[43:48.35]Stupid mud patch.
[43:51.14]Don't be mad.
[43:51.62]Don't be mad.
[43:52.02]Don't be mad.
[43:52.38]Don't be mad at me.
[43:59.28]Right in the forehead.
[44:00.14]Oh, okay.
[44:00.62]We have to kill the small fish.
[44:03.76]The ads here are just completely harassing us.
[44:10.23]He's got friends now.
[44:12.15]Or they're attacking him.
[44:13.51]I can't tell.
[44:21.03]Oh, please.
[44:21.51]Come on.
[44:21.79]I just want a drink.
[44:22.47]All right.
[44:23.68]This one's actually fish out of water right now, which is crazy.
[44:27.74]I got one more of these bombs.
[44:28.88]Here he comes again.
[44:30.06]Use the opportunity in case he knocks him down.
[44:31.66]Because then we can get him right to stun him.
[44:37.18]Go for it.
[44:38.12]Go get him.
[44:38.94]Big boy's back.
[44:40.54]He's looking for an opportunity to tackle.
[44:42.91]Did he go for you instead?
[44:48.61]This is crazy.
[44:49.41]Come on.
[44:50.17]Really?
[44:51.31]Oh my god.
[44:51.95]I thought he was going for him, but he just kept going and hit somebody else.
[44:54.45]Me instead.
[44:55.63]Yeah, he's now aggro to us.
[44:58.35]There comes a dragon.
[45:01.27]No way.
[45:01.69]Yes, look above you.
[45:03.99]He's coming down.
[45:07.92]Why?
[45:08.76]Why do we have three?
[45:10.50]What the fuck, man?
[45:12.00]Is this like the Pokemon legendaries?
[45:14.32]Like all three legendaries are here in the same scene on the very first episode?
[45:19.54]Okay.
[45:20.66]Look at what you're going to get to kill eventually.
[45:23.08]This is like the preview for the latest episode.
[45:26.30]Alright, what's the game plan here?
[45:29.16]Where'd the swamp monster go?
[45:30.79]I don't know where the swamp monster went.
[45:32.19]He kind of got away.
[45:33.43]But honestly, can you blame us?
[45:40.24]Why are they all fighting over?
[45:41.26]Look, he's drinking.
[45:42.42]He's drinking.
[45:43.62]He was just a little thirsty, but he scared off both of the other two monsters.
[45:47.06]They both left.
[45:47.92]Whoever owns the swamp owns the drinking water.
[45:51.71]I think he's done.
[45:53.27]Let's see.
[45:53.63]Is he leaving?
[45:54.31]He's just flying away into another zone.
[45:57.85]That's crazy.
[46:01.73]You can't get this in a story mission.
[46:03.46]Come on.
[46:03.76]That was fucking cool.
[46:04.32]Where'd they go?
[46:09.16]Alright, he's down here.
[46:09.84]The mud monster's over here, I think.
[46:11.42]Right?
[46:11.62]Yeah, he is.
[46:15.10]He's on the mini-map.
[46:17.62]We've actually smelled him enough now.
[46:20.47]Oh, he's coming back.
[46:22.69]What does that do?
[46:25.23]There he is.
[46:26.25]There he is!
[46:26.95]Oh, that mouth of his.
[46:31.79]That mouth of his!
[46:32.65]Let me load you up.
[46:39.20]I'm just standing in his fucking way.
[46:40.60]Alright, I want to do my special move.
[46:47.84]Right there, right in his head.
[46:50.20]Here we go.
[46:56.14]Shit.
[46:57.30]Can we get him on land?
[47:03.82]That would be great, but I don't think land exists.
[47:09.04]I gotta hit his tail.
[47:09.78]I think his tail is like the real weak spot.
[47:11.75]It's probably his hands or his legs or something.
[47:15.27]I'm like running out of ammo.
[47:17.59]One of these very like tip spots on his tail, I get yellow numbers.
[47:24.23]What about slicing ammo?
[47:25.54]I don't have any slicing ammo left.
[47:30.30]No.
[47:31.90]Speaking of ammo, I kinda don't have very much left.
[47:41.33]Where the hell is he?
[47:42.91]He's just... He's right on top of you.
[47:50.12]Is that it?
[47:51.68]Is he dead?
[47:52.50]No, he's just hurt.
[47:53.64]In the... I don't know, in the head.
[47:56.80]In the face.
[47:57.22]In the legs.
[48:02.12]That didn't really work, but that's what I was trying to do the whole time.
[48:05.16]I gotta... I gotta sharpen.
[48:08.29]He's making a... He's running.
[48:09.69]He's on his... He's on his... Oh, no.
[48:14.55]What?
[48:14.91]This is not ready?
[48:16.11]What the fuck?
[48:16.83]What is... Oh, come on.
[48:19.17]I'm sitting in line on the fucking ground.
[48:21.63]All right.
[48:27.27]Is he going to stop?
[48:28.01]Is he going to chill?
[48:28.83]What's he doing?
[48:29.33]Oh, he's doing the rolling around again.
[48:32.55]He knocks you down while he's doing it, too.
[48:37.39]Alright, that's definitely not a weak spot.
[48:42.70]I'm almost out of, like, ammo here.
[48:44.62]I'm out of healing as well.
[48:46.80]You're out of ammo?
[48:47.50]I'm out of ammo and out of healing.
[48:50.10]How do you run out of ammo?
[48:50.98]Because we've... This is the second monster we fought, and I'm out.
[48:55.79]I have, like, level 1, and I have level 2 ammo for normal, but that's it.
[49:02.79]Well, we gotta kill him faster, I guess, or...
[49:05.76]We can make a tactical retreat, but that would be the least... Nah, he's gotta be close here.
[49:11.12]Alright, alright.
[49:12.04]I like that meaty hit.
[49:13.30]There is definitely, like, back of the tail is a weak spot for sure.
[49:16.64]There's like a little ridge.
[49:20.38]Right here.
[49:20.96]Like, under the tail.
[49:25.44]I think you are getting... Also the face.
[49:27.78]Yeah, face is definitely always... The mouth.
[49:30.00]Like little ears.
[49:30.66]He's evolving.
[49:40.44]What is he doing?
[49:40.94]Uh-oh.
[49:41.54]Oh no.
[49:41.94]Where is he?
[49:42.22]I heard a roar.
[49:44.16]Oh, the bear off his back.
[49:46.00]Behind this little thing.
[49:47.08]I'm taking a little swim real quick for a second there.
[49:50.78]Yes, the bear off his back.
[49:53.59]And he looks like he's looking at you.
[49:55.41]He's looking at me.
[49:56.69]Is he behind me?
[49:58.73]Where is he?
[49:59.49]Okay.
[50:02.07]Of course he is.
[50:03.45]He's like right next to you.
[50:05.01]No, he don't jump on, man.
[50:06.97]I think he accidentally hit him, I think.
[50:13.91]I'm gonna have another special here.
[50:15.55]Hopefully I can use it.
[50:16.89]That's not the enemy I wanted to fight!
[50:22.10]Why do you have to be right here?
[50:24.94]Every couple seconds.
[50:25.86]Alright, please just weaken each other until one of you dies.
[50:28.56]Alright, he's getting stuck with mud.
[50:32.79]He's doing the underwater thing.
[50:34.99]There he goes.
[50:35.59]Nice.
[50:35.95]Good hits.
[50:37.13]Nice job.
[50:37.75]Excellent work.
[50:39.37]Going in for a little lick.
[50:40.63]Careful.
[50:40.97]Careful.
[50:43.93]Why?
[50:44.73]Why did you do that?
[50:45.97]That was no reason for him to do that.
[50:49.31]I'm gonna die.
[50:49.79]I gotta run.
[50:50.21]I have to move out.
[50:51.45]Isn't that the toad that explodes?
[50:54.95]I don't know.
[50:55.61]I don't know where it is.
[50:56.27]I don't know what it is.
[50:56.93]Can I shoot myself with the fucking recovery ammo?
[50:59.58]Where did the slithery guy go?
[51:04.06]Oh no.
[51:04.48]I'm gonna die.
[51:06.34]I can heal us.
[51:08.06]Alright, I have potions.
[51:11.20]God damn it.
[51:11.88]What are you doing over here?
[51:13.10]He's going right for you.
[51:14.53]Why are you here?
[51:15.11]I don't know where the other enemy went.
[51:17.05]I think he like... He went back to his normal lair.
[51:21.69]I marked it.
[51:22.17]I think it's this way.
[51:24.67]No, I can't fucking heal myself.
[51:25.89]God damn it.
[51:26.57]You're just gonna have to run.
[51:28.27]Is he right behind me?
[51:29.95]Uh, yes.
[51:30.39]Of course he is.
[51:34.60]He does this thing where he, like, quick turns.
[51:36.72]All right, come over here.
[51:37.81]Let me see if I can heal you.
[51:38.83]If I heal you next to me... No, you come to me because this is where the guy we're fighting is.
[51:42.27]He's chasing me right now.
[51:43.25]He's not happy about it.
[51:46.67]Oh, the Wrathion's over there now.
[51:47.65]This guy better not have healed or else I'm going to be really upset.
[51:51.59]Hold on, I got an idea.
[51:54.14]Okay, if I stand, like, right next to you... I don't have my trap.
[51:57.42]All right, I wonder if, like, I can heal myself off of you.
[52:07.17]I don't know.
[52:07.57]Now's a good time to try.
[52:08.49]I'm standing here.
[52:10.26]Right here.
[52:12.44]No.
[52:13.32]I don't heal myself.
[52:14.06]You did heal me.
[52:14.68]I heal you.
[52:15.28]Do you not have any potions?
[52:17.10]I don't have any potions left.
[52:17.94]It's time for me to become Mr. Heal Man.
[52:21.04]I'm just going to try to heal you while you go after Monster Boy.
[52:24.60]Okay.
[52:27.48]Watch out for the snakes behind you.
[52:29.76]I do see those, yeah.
[52:32.17]Don't come for me.
[52:32.93]He is, isn't he?
[52:33.73]He is, yes.
[52:46.43]I don't know.
[52:46.95]I feel like I'm getting decent shots in.
[52:50.63]I have like nine heals to give you, which is like 30% HP.
[52:53.80]Got a shot?
[52:59.82]He's just doing this weird like... Okay.
[53:04.60]His pattern is changing.
[53:16.29]Oh, no, no, no, no, please!
[53:19.39]Alright, I'm gonna whetstone real quick.
[53:23.98]One hit and I'm dead, man.
[53:25.80]Really?
[53:26.20]Oh, yeah.
[53:27.66]It's that bad, huh?
[53:28.62]Oh, it's it.
[53:29.68]I'm dire right now.
[53:34.69]I have to run away.
[53:35.43]He's coming for you again.
[53:36.19]No, please don't come for me again.
[53:37.61]There he comes.
[53:39.05]There's no reason for you to come for me.
[53:40.39]I'm so useless.
[53:41.33]Can I craft something over here?
[53:42.93]Hang on, I'm a little tired right now.
[53:44.77]A little tuckered out.
[53:47.84]No, I can't craft anything right now.
[53:51.10]Where is he?
[53:52.46]Over here in the mud.
[53:54.64]I gotta stay away from his mouth, though.
[53:56.04]I just don't want him to come... He's gonna spin around and come up to me.
[54:05.15]No, don't.
[54:07.47]I'm just gonna sit here and Crusader's Crossbow you.
[54:11.87]Alright, that was a pretty sizable amount of damage that I just did.
[54:15.41]Good!
[54:16.70]Good!
[54:18.13]He's always going for you.
[54:27.97]I'm dead.
[54:30.87]And you're dead.
[54:34.51]The good news is there wasn't a one death and you lose the mission.
[54:42.15]Well, here's some other good news.
[54:44.58]I have full health.
[54:45.42]I'll see you in a second.
[54:46.74]You do.
[54:47.12]Make sure you stop and get potions.
[54:53.01]Jar jar.
[54:55.03]There's nothing in the box.
[54:57.51]Because this is just... This is not like a mission.
[55:00.61]So, hold on.
[55:03.97]Can I make anything?
[55:04.75]No, I don't have any herbs.
[55:12.90]Canteen.
[55:13.86]Can I make ammo right now?
[55:16.80]I think so.
[55:17.06]That was amazing.
[55:19.26]I don't even know how I did that, but it was crazy.
[55:21.86]Actually, I do know how I did that.
[55:22.72]I did my ultimate combo.
[55:24.24]I jumped on his head, stabbed him through the back of the neck, and then my sword exploded in his neck.
[55:28.76]It was pretty crazy.
[55:29.64]Is he dead?
[55:30.71]No, he's still alive.
[55:31.39]This guy does not die, actually.
[55:35.49]I can make some ammo here.
[55:36.49]I have spread ammo again, so that's good.
[55:42.04]He's kind of like thinking about going to a different region.
[55:44.98]Yeah, he's moving out.
[55:46.80]Alright, I'm coming.
[55:50.17]I don't know what he... I have no idea what he's doing actually or who he's attacking.
[55:55.83]He's trying to get mud.
[55:56.85]I'm coming.
[56:03.49]Now he's going back home.

[56:36.69]Not really.
[56:37.15]Right when I stop to eat, this happens.
[56:38.51]Don't give me a fucking break.
[56:41.11]Right when I stop to eat, I, like, get exhausted.
[56:43.45]What a fucking idiot.
[56:44.19]Alright, here I come.
[56:54.52]Alright, I might be playing a little risky right now, because I am starting to get low on health.
[56:58.66]I have a mega potion.
[57:00.32]Oh, I missed two shots on you for recovery, Adam.
[57:03.90]Sorry, I didn't know you were going to shoot.
[57:07.88]Make that four shots of not hitting you with recovery ammo.
[57:13.26]Apparently.
[57:13.76]Uh-oh.
[57:14.28]Alright, go for you again.
[57:16.70]Go for Mr. Mosquito while I heal up.
[57:19.24]I would love to actually have one of these hit you.
[57:20.90]That would be fucking fantastic.
[57:27.70]Here he goes.
[57:28.84]It's like night time.
[57:34.40]Dash over.
[57:35.72]You broke apart, or I broke apart.
[57:37.52]I think I might have broken his tail.
[57:42.61]God.
[57:42.81]Oh, come on.
[57:51.67]Trying to no-scope him across the map.
[57:54.65]I gotta walk either right next to him or... Is he dead?
[58:01.50]Not yet.
[58:02.28]Good.

[58:41.49]Yeah, you're right.
[58:42.75]What the fuck?
[58:44.25]Give me a fucking break.
[58:46.37]Oh my god, I'm so angry right now.
[58:49.59]I looked over at chat talking about somebody talking about how mad I was and I got hit by the thing and now I'm even madder.
[58:55.96]Oh my fucking god.
[58:57.62]I need to use the whetstone.
[59:00.70]I'm never looking at chat ever again.
[59:04.68]I'm so fucking angry right now.
[59:08.17]That's the thing I had to read.
[59:10.11]That's the thing I read.
[59:11.21]Oh my god.
[59:13.03]Rage holds absolutely no bounds.
[59:21.57]God damn it.
[59:24.60]Is he dead?
[59:25.26]He's gone.
[59:25.62]He just left the whole area.
[59:27.96]I literally think he's gone from the entire area.
[59:30.18]I think he's gone from the whole area, yes.
[59:33.12]I think we didn't kill him fast enough.
[59:37.92]I'm getting rid of this stupid shit gun.
[59:40.10]Fucking gun sucks asshole.
[59:49.10]I can't fucking believe it.
[59:56.39]I put on like the dual welding fucking blades and I'm doing like a thousand damage a second.
[60:02.28]I put on the gun and analog console aiming makes me want to fucking throw up in my own bed and then lie in it.
[60:12.79]I'm going to the fucking hammer.
[60:44.18]I'm so fucking angry right now.
[60:56.89]The heavy bow gun.
[60:57.77]AKA, take forever to fucking do anything.
[61:01.01]I don't know why I'm continuing to use it.
[61:17.33]Hey, man.
[61:24.86]I am in full tilt.
[61:25.96]I'm getting, like, launched around.
[61:29.44]I look over in the chat, and I see, like, wow, you're actually mad.
[61:32.72]And then that's what the catalyst was to me.
[61:34.88]Get me, like, ricocheted around.
[61:36.57]Oh, man, it's not.
[61:40.21]Oh, man.
[61:43.55]Give me the fucking hammer.
[61:45.71]I'm throwing this thing in the garbage can.
[61:51.46]A poor craftsman blames his tools when he... I'm actually fucking infuriated.
[62:08.48]Alright, how are you feeling?
[62:10.54]No, I'm not over it yet.
[62:12.06]Oh, okay.
[62:13.56]Check it.
[62:16.64]I'm like a child.
[62:18.16]Yeah, I left.
[62:19.10]I left that whole thing.
[62:22.10]No, it's probably worth leaving so that we can upgrade our gear.
[62:27.12]Yeah, I'm going to the hammer.
[62:30.28]I'm getting rid of this stupid fucking heavy bow gun.
[62:34.12]Oh, this is like pushing you over the edge.
[62:36.84]This is the heavy standstill and miss gun.
[62:40.05]I ain't gonna be that guy anymore.
[62:44.89]Where is it?
[62:45.23]I gotta get it from my box.
[62:47.39]What does this want me to do?
[62:50.63]Hunt all targets.
[62:51.59]That's kind of a lot.
[62:52.71]I'm gonna take my fucking anger out on like a Jargus.
[62:55.63]Hunt the Baroth.
[62:56.53]That's hard.
[63:00.87]Alright, time for some upgrades.
[63:02.37]I want some new armor and I want a new, better version of this weapon.
[63:07.29]What weapon are you going to switch to?
[63:09.45]The hammer.
[63:10.57]Oh, the hammer.
[63:12.83]Stay tough.
[63:14.38]Got some really cool combos.
[63:17.42]My accent gets stronger when I'm angry.
[63:19.54]Alright, what do I want to do here?
[63:27.80]Blooming hammer, water, aqua hammer.
[63:31.88]Really.
[63:35.76]Interesting.
[63:37.91]I think I'm going to do Aquahammer.
[63:41.45]It's okay.
[63:42.15]It's okay.
[63:42.99]He's still reading chat.
[63:45.01]I hope that was fucking funny for you guys.
[63:47.76]Because that was like... Tear my ears off.
[63:54.20]I think I'm going to do Water.
[63:59.01]Did I do Bloomin' Onion Hammer, or should I do... I need to, like, I need to, like, fucking shake the cobwebs here.
[64:12.20]The Kulu Hammer is good.
[64:14.17]What does it require, a bone?
[64:23.04]Why does a hammer have sharpness?
[64:24.48]I don't know.
[64:25.22]Well, we'll do water.
[64:26.52]I can currently make it.
[64:27.54]Why not?
[64:27.86]I'm already halfway down the tree anyways here.
[64:30.38]Let's try it.
[64:33.76]Get some water elemental damage.
[64:35.15]Let's do pukey pukey.
[64:39.55]You cannot roll back this upgrade when it's done.
[64:41.67]Really?
[64:41.99]Wow.
[64:42.69]Okay.
[64:43.17]I probably need to keep this in mind.
[64:46.85]Don't worry.
[64:47.25]It wasn't funny.
[64:48.17]Okay.
[64:49.97]That makes me feel great.
[64:57.87]Let's just do it.
[64:58.97]What's the worst that could happen?
[64:59.81]I lose it.
[65:05.72]I'm kidding.
[65:08.54]I'm dope toy with my emotions right now.
[65:10.34]I'm very fragile right now.
[65:13.00]Do you guys think I'm some strong streamer?
[65:16.42]No, I'm a very fragile person.
[65:19.54]I have a very short temper.
[65:21.66]And I'm an extraordinarily fragile person.
[65:25.39]Don't toy with my emotions right now!
[65:31.13]Alright, let's use this.
[65:37.02]Let's watch him... break.
[65:39.94]Holy shit, that sounded like, morbid.
[65:43.06]Uh, anyways...
[65:45.54]Thank you, too.
[65:47.36]I missed a lot of bits here.
[65:48.36]I'll try to catch up a little bit until Talix is currently deafened.
[65:54.69]Let's break him.
[65:55.53]Break him.
[65:59.13]Thank you, too.
[66:03.23]Calm buying for the $1.
[66:04.29]I lost my debit card.

[66:11.35]Then the other card can't be used.

[67:27.95]No.
[67:28.95]That sounds terrible.
[67:31.54]I need to go get some... hunt some game.
[67:34.64]That sounds better.
[67:37.48]Thank you, TheShredder.
[67:39.78]Thank you, TheShredder.

[67:46.70]Do you have any complaints?
[67:50.08]No.
[67:50.64]I mean, look, if you can get used to 30 FPS, then you're fine.
[67:55.85]I haven't seen any massive slowdowns yet.
[67:59.83]If you could play Bloodborne, you could play this.
[68:02.14]They're in the same level, I would say.
[68:05.71]Also, thank you to Flinchy Ferret for the $5.
[68:08.47]Monster Hunter is my favorite game series of all time, and I'm so glad to see you playing it.

[68:14.14]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[68:16.64]Thank you to Camel for the $1.
[68:18.48]Cheer.
[68:19.46]It was a cheer, Jupiter.
[68:21.30]Congratulations.
[68:22.06]Hey, so, funny story about the last fight.
[68:24.53]What's the funny story?
[68:26.30]Aren't you wearing a few Kulu armor pieces?
[68:29.18]I don't know.
[68:30.92]I just opened my map like a fucking idiot.
[68:32.56]Let me actually figure out how to get to my actual inventory.
[68:36.56]Do you have at least the Kulu headpiece?
[68:39.97]I have the Kulu headpiece.
[68:42.43]But nothing else?
[68:43.17]That's it.
[68:44.09]Okay.
[68:44.31]Well, that's not that big of a deal then.
[68:45.49]But apparently the Kulu armor is its weakest against water, which is what we were just fighting.
[68:52.53]and water types.
[68:53.05]So, if you were wearing Kulu mail, you would actually have, like, he would be really strong against you.
[68:59.51]Alright, so what do you want to do next?
[69:01.31]I want revenge on that motherfucker.
[69:03.23]This is what I want to do.
[69:03.87]Oh, we're going back.
[69:04.57]We're going back.
[69:05.21]I want to smash his head in with a hammer.
[69:06.75]Oh, okay.
[69:07.09]I honestly thought we were going to move on.
[69:08.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:10.07]I'm getting revenge.
[69:11.03]I'm burying a hammer in that guy's head.
[69:12.99]I see.
[69:13.49]Alright, well, I'm on board with that.
[69:14.91]I just want to make sure that my weapon, yes, it is as upgraded as it possibly can be.
[69:21.85]I want to pee in his fucking food.
[69:26.17]And we're gonna do it without the cats, correct?
[69:28.51]No cats.
[69:30.63]I'm not gonna be able to get over this until we kill this thing.
[69:32.67]Like, right now.
[69:34.03]Okay, I'm ready.
[69:35.77]And I'm using a goddamn water hammer.
[69:38.37]You're using a water hammer?
[69:39.45]I just made the water hammer.
[69:42.21]Sounds like, is it strong against water, though?
[69:44.81]I think it's just water damage.
[69:46.92]I think mine does water damage, too.
[69:48.94]So, you're not alone.
[69:51.57]All right, let's get over this, because I'm going to be stuck here until we kill him.
[69:55.21]All right, so here's the bad news.
[69:57.50]To easily get into an expedition together, the best way to do that is to, remember we had to do an investigation to get into the same expedition area first?
[70:07.41]Yep.
[70:09.25]So that's really like the best way to do it, unfortunately.
[70:12.53]Okay.
[70:12.93]So start an investigation.
[70:15.41]Do like an easy investigation.
[70:18.12]And then we'll just be in the open world as soon as the investigation's over.
[70:22.20]Okay.
[70:23.90]To fight the guy.
[70:25.36]So just do the easiest one possible.
[70:27.46]I'm going to take this helmet off then.
[70:29.40]If it's minus three.
[70:31.50]But is it minus three defense?
[70:34.26]It's like having minus three defense because it's elemental defense.
[70:38.40]Okay, because I have... That's, like, nine more defense generally.
[70:42.79]Imagine that he has plus three damage to you.
[70:45.59]But even his plus three damage doesn't matter because that's, like, nine more armor than what I would have had anyways.
[70:52.23]I don't know the details of that.
[70:54.41]Okay.
[70:55.83]Let me see here.
[70:57.18]All right, this one should be easy.
[70:59.80]This is just... Hunt a Great Jagras.
[71:03.54]Wait, this is in the wrong area, though.
[71:05.62]We have to go to the... We have to go Wild Spire Waste.
[71:09.48]Okay, so I have on... Pukey Mill is really good against water.
[71:14.81]Anything else I have for water?
[71:15.91]I mean, look at the map.
[71:17.67]Do they have, like, a wildlife list on the map?
[71:21.31]That's a good question.
[71:24.33]Yes, we want to fight the Eurototus.
[71:27.52]And he's only in the Wildspire Waste.
[71:30.28]Alright.
[71:31.32]So, let's... I'm real hot right now, so I'm gonna let you start it.
[71:37.34]Okay.
[71:38.28]Okay.
[71:40.26]I just need to go talk to the investigation people.
[71:44.52]Only games like this, man, just get into my head and they start to like... It made it even worse because I had to read chat and then the thing I had to read had to be how angry I was and then they just went off the rails.
[71:55.75]It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[71:57.05]It was.
[71:57.57]It was just a fucking straw man argument.
[72:01.59]Somebody built up the straw man and knocked it down and then I stood up.
[72:07.36]Alright, we want to go to Wildspire.
[72:09.56]And we want to do something easy.
[72:11.38]So this one, do we want to... I'm gonna get a different helmet.
[72:16.34]Slayton Gajow.
[72:18.77]Slayton.
[72:19.45]That should be pretty easy.
[72:20.93]All the question marks.
[72:22.67]All right, then.
[72:26.95]Blay 20, that's not in the right place.
[72:31.60]This is good versus water.
[72:33.76]Blayton Kastadons.
[72:36.77]I don't know which one of those is the easiest one.
[72:38.77]Probably the 10 fish people.
[72:40.79]I don't think this really matters.
[72:44.53]Starting the mission.
[72:45.17]Okay, you're starting the mission?
[72:50.73]Yes, I will post the investigation.
[72:57.09]Make sure it's in the right area.
[73:00.82]And... Starting in the eastern camp.
[73:05.52]Mm-hmm.
[73:08.44]Joining quest.
[73:09.00]Should see it posted now.
[73:11.74]I see it.
[73:12.66]Slaying investigation.
[73:14.14]So you're going to the south, the eastern camp?
[73:17.58]Which one is that you're going to?
[73:18.66]I did eastern, yeah.
[73:21.29]We haven't used any vouchers either.
[73:26.35]no I think yeah uh vouchers are to soup up the quest rewards I think so it's almost like uh I'm so sure that I'm gonna win this that I want these rewards to be even better I'm so positive you can you can hold like five at a time five or six you get them for a daily logging in like an mmo all right let's let's go we're going right to this guy's swamp so you know like imagine oscar the grouch's trash can
[73:54.20]Oscar the Grouch is such a dick, you know what I mean?
[73:57.93]Yeah.
[73:58.25]We're just gonna walk by, like, we're walking by, and we're just gonna drop a grenade in Oscar the Grouch's fucking trash can.
[74:04.11]You understand what I'm saying?
[74:06.51]Just go right there and just go at him immediately at his home when he's sleeping.
[74:10.35]This sounds really bad.
[74:11.74]Like, out of context.
[74:14.28]Just go there when he's sleeping.
[74:16.98]You go there when he's fucking sleeping and you kill him.
[74:19.20]Okay, uh, that's gonna cost extra.
[74:26.30]We're just total vengeance mode.
[74:30.46]Let me see your new thing, because this is my new thing.
[74:33.48]Here's my new thing.
[74:34.20]Okay, looking cool.
[74:40.53]What?
[74:42.41]That works against people?
[74:44.21]Apparently I can do that to you.
[74:45.49]Alright, can you do it off the edge?
[74:46.90]Let's find out.
[74:47.48]Alright, here we go.
[74:50.20]One...
[74:53.77]Well, apparently you're in the right spot.
[74:56.21]I'll stand over here.
[75:00.45]Oh, there's an invisible wall there.
[75:01.73]There's an invisible wall.
[75:02.43]Okay.
[75:03.19]No fun allowed.
[75:03.85]Alright, so I don't know how to use the hammer.
[75:06.21]I know there's like the charge and you get the different tiers.
[75:08.19]We're going to try hard, right?
[75:10.46]Look, it's going to be better than... Let's just go kill this stupid tin fish first.
[75:14.48]The fish are in the area with the guy, okay?
[75:17.30]But we still should come over here and probably eat.
[75:20.44]Just in case we end up fighting him.
[75:25.93]Watch it.
[75:27.37]Oh, man.
[75:28.09]If this guy kills us again.
[75:30.33]Oh, man.
[75:31.25]If this guy kills us again.
[75:32.58]Okay, so if I cook a Baroth tail, does it use the tail so I can't craft with it anymore?
[75:43.25]Or does having the tail unlock a new recipe for me that I can use again and again?
[75:49.73]I don't know.
[75:50.63]That's weird.
[75:51.19]Because I'm giving an item to oven roast, which makes it sound like it's for food, but it might not be for food.
[76:02.34]Don't eat it.
[76:05.02]All right.
[76:05.52]I need to go crush something.
[76:07.74]It costs 100 points.
[76:11.64]What is the... Because you can charge this.
[76:14.16]You can charge it once.
[76:15.78]And you can do one, two, three, right?
[76:18.76]It says hand over an item.
[76:22.57]So did you get defense up?
[76:24.01]Actually, you're going to have a lot more defense up just for using a melee weapon.
[76:30.51]So you'll survive a lot longer.
[76:31.85]I want to get attack up.
[76:36.61]Four PS4.
[76:46.20]So combo-wise, I didn't figure out.
[76:47.52]I can't even hear my PS4.
[76:48.14]How can you hear yours?
[76:49.44]Because it's loud.
[76:52.06]Because my PS4 is sitting right on the desk, and my microphone's on the desk, too.
[76:55.49]So how come in the last, like, few years, we have the PS4, the PS4 Pro, the PS4 Slim, the Xbox One, the Xbox One S, and the Xbox One X, and they're all the same console?
[77:09.04]You know, that's a question for... What's his name?
[77:12.48]Phil, um... Phil Harmonix?
[77:16.68]Phil, what's his name?
[77:18.27]The guy that runs, the guy, the, the, the, the, the captain of Microsoft.
[77:22.29]Like, isn't that, isn't that diluting your brand somewhat?
[77:26.71]Where, where, you know, grandma goes to get Johnny a Christmas present and doesn't know which of the Xboxes is the right one?
[77:34.33]I guess.
[77:36.53]Probably, yeah.
[77:37.53]All right.
[77:38.29]Let's go into this, guys.
[77:39.70]Let's go right to the swamp.
[77:43.98]We can dive in the water, right?
[77:45.30]Wait, what's over here?
[77:48.93]Yeah, exactly.
[77:49.67]What's over here?
[77:50.49]See?
[77:51.23]Hold on a minute.
[77:52.39]In... See?
[77:54.53]Like, what's over here?
[77:55.95]No, you don't understand.
[77:57.45]You don't understand.
[77:59.65]My god.
[78:00.59]In my total fucking stupidity rage.
[78:04.40]I didn't make any potions.
[78:05.50]I have nothing.
[78:07.46]Oh, yeah.
[78:07.70]We should probably grab some potions out of the... There's nothing in there.
[78:10.68]There's nothing in there.
[78:12.08]There's nothing in there?
[78:12.86]Because it's not like a mission.
[78:15.45]Oh, they didn't give us anything for free.
[78:17.17]I don't think they give you anything for free.
[78:18.55]I have one mega potion, one nutrient, and seven... I did bring seven regular potions, so I'm fairly prepared.
[78:26.03]Can you do, like, crafting at the camp?
[78:27.73]You can do crafting at the campsite, I think.
[78:29.61]I mean, can't... But do I... I don't think I have... You might even be able to do it here.
[78:32.63]I don't think so.
[78:35.54]Honestly, I think you can.
[78:37.22]Let's see.
[78:37.50]Because you can do crafting lists just standing.
[78:39.48]Okay, all right, yeah.
[78:40.10]Good, good, good, good, good.
[78:41.12]I was about to have a fucking meltdown.
[78:44.96]Let's go inside, you know?
[78:46.30]Take a couple puffs off the cheapen's pipe and relax.
[78:49.82]Alright, let's go with... Don't need antidotes.
[78:54.59]Sort this, please.
[78:57.93]You know, if we're really try-harding here, then we should probably craft some new, like, crazy explosives.
[79:05.25]I got explosive barrels.
[79:07.03]Let's go with... We could try to blow them up.
[79:08.83]Energy drink.
[79:12.11]Nutrients.
[79:12.93]Get them over there.
[79:14.80]I don't have any mega potions, so you need honey for mega potions, right?
[79:19.03]Uh, probably?
[79:22.77]You do need, you need honey for mega nutrients.
[79:26.91]How do you make a mega potion?
[79:29.07]Um, mega potion requires potion and honey, so you were right.
[79:34.03]Okay, so I don't have any honey.
[79:35.95]I have ten potions, three nutrients, and I'll bring, I'll bring an energy drink.
[79:51.18]Energy drink.
[79:51.86]A guild-approved beverage that boosts your stamina.
[79:55.24]Okay.
[79:55.86]Sounds good.
[79:58.74]I already have something.
[79:59.88]I have to keep remembering.
[80:00.85]You have to push in L3 to switch boxes.
[80:05.91]Because I keep messing with my brain here.
[80:08.57]Alright, I think that's all I can do.
[80:13.65]Yeah, that's all I can do.
[80:17.42]so you can could you like make a pitfall trap for this we can make a shock trap for this monster oh let's see I can make some more potions how would we capture it without an actual mission to capture it I don't think I'm sure you want to kill it though you probably want to kill it don't you I mean we need to kill this thing this thing has to die I mean if we can make shock traps um
[80:46.53]If you want to try that.
[80:48.91]Yeah, I mean, I just don't know how effective it is.
[80:51.67]May as well bring one though, right?
[80:53.51]Just bring one or two.
[80:54.47]Who knows if it's even going to work.
[80:56.73]But I'll bring two.
[80:59.15]I want to bring a pitfall trap.
[81:02.05]I'm bringing two shock traps.
[81:02.75]A trap for catching certain large monsters.
[81:07.31]Because we kind of know where it goes back and forth, right?
[81:09.55]It goes between the swamp and the place where you fought the T-Rex.
[81:14.13]So if we just put a trap, I guess another monster might trigger it on accident.
[81:18.47]Yeah, that could trigger it.
[81:20.73]All right.
[81:22.30]I believe I'm ready to move on out of here.
[81:25.96]Okay.
[81:26.62]I think I am as soon as I get the... Make sure you... Because when you craft, make sure you get them out of your box.
[81:34.82]Yeah, I got them here.
[81:37.24]I have my potions.
[81:38.06]I have my nutrients.
[81:38.94]I have my energy drink.
[81:42.58]I'm ready to move.
[81:49.23]Are you ready?
[81:49.81]Almost ready.
[81:51.19]You can start heading over there if you want.
[81:52.45]I can catch up.
[81:56.05]Just making sure I come well equipped.
[81:59.19]I'm going.
[82:00.75]Go ahead.
[82:03.48]I'm tracking him down.
[82:04.36]I'm not going to make any rash decisions without you, so don't worry.
[82:09.13]I've just got some interesting items that I want to try.
[82:12.47]Alright, how do we... Let's get out of here.
[82:19.01]What's the exit for this place?
[82:20.19]I'm just going to Baroth's Shell for no reason.
[82:26.10]How do we get out of here?
[82:30.48]Oh, in the water.
[82:33.28]I think you just have to jump down.
[82:34.64]This is like a water.
[82:36.10]There's an exit from the water, I think.
[82:41.37]Okay.
[82:42.75]Got all my stuff.
[82:43.91]Ready to go.
[82:45.21]Mm-hmm.
[82:47.77]Back to it.
[82:51.56]A cacti.
[82:54.50]Okay.
[82:55.12]Got the ration.
[82:56.26]Eaten.
[82:57.86]Mega nutrients.
[82:58.64]Did I already eat these?
[82:59.54]Bobble cactus?
[83:09.61]Okay.
[83:11.57]No sign of him so far.
[83:15.62]Reporting in.
[83:23.88]Where is this sludge motherfucker?
[83:25.85]I hate this enemy.
[83:27.07]I hate him.
[83:29.17]I hated this guy when we first killed him.
[83:30.75]I hate him even more now.
[83:42.14]If you want some bones, there's some bones right on me.
[83:52.17]That constant backbone whirring really adds to the professionalism of the stream.
[83:58.62]Well, it's the PS4.
[84:00.46]I can't put it anywhere else.
[84:05.06]Where's it gonna go?
[84:05.74]On the ground?
[84:08.26]I can't even put it on the ground.
[84:09.24]The cord won't reach.
[84:17.67]That does so much damage.
[84:25.02]This does so much damage!
[84:26.00]This is a fu- Why would I- Why was I using the gun?
[84:28.32]What the hell was I doing?
[84:31.58]That does 80 d- I was doing like 4- Like 8 damage per shot.
[84:36.91]What on fucking earth was I thinking?
[84:45.11]Just slaughtering everything.
[84:56.11]I'm going to carve him up.
[84:57.53]These are the guys we have to kill.
[84:58.71]The monster swam right by you.
[85:11.11]All right, are you here?
[85:12.92]There's somebody over there.
[85:14.86]Yeah, he's here.
[85:16.00]All right, so let's try and trap him.
[85:18.40]He heard you.
[85:19.46]He's like, I was killing all these dumb... He's here.
[85:21.94]He's like looking at me.
[85:23.68]He's currently angry.
[85:24.46]I'm going to put a trap on this, and we just lure him over, okay?
[85:28.52]Putting the trap right here.
[85:30.46]It's there.
[85:31.12]The trap is here.
[85:32.84]Lure him over it.
[85:33.66]Move left.
[85:34.80]It's got a huge space.
[85:36.10]I shocked him.
[85:37.08]All right.
[85:37.30]Now let's get him.
[85:41.62]What?
[85:44.42]All right.
[85:44.72]We're going to have to sort that out real quick.
[85:52.67]That was a very expensive All right, I can only set that up like twice Actually no that was the only time It's gone now
[86:05.46]Professional hunters here, ladies and gentlemen.
[86:07.34]Got our license yesterday.
[86:09.10]Yeah, we got them.
[86:10.52]We did a good job.
[86:11.24]We're not going to lose this.
[86:12.44]Step two.
[86:14.38]Here's what I'm going to do, okay?
[86:17.28]We're going to do step two.
[86:20.10]Step two.
[86:21.04]I have a shock trap.
[86:22.46]Look, I'm going to put an explosive barrel up here.
[86:25.61]Yeah.
[86:26.45]And we're going to blow it up, okay?
[86:29.91]There we go.
[86:30.33]I don't know how to blow that up.
[86:32.15]Planted a bomb.
[86:34.33]Yeah, I planted a bomb.
[86:36.11]Okay.
[86:38.75]And make sure I have my... Can I blow it up?
[86:41.65]Where's the bomb?
[86:42.83]It's over here.
[86:43.33]It's by me.
[86:43.97]Okay, coming over to you.
[86:45.77]I'm leading him over here.
[86:47.13]It's this big explosive barrel.
[86:49.25]Got to keep coming up the waterfall.
[86:51.01]Uh-huh.
[86:51.57]Almost out of stamina.
[86:52.35]I'm going to start to faint.
[86:53.57]It's okay.
[86:54.51]Just don't stand next... Okay.
[86:56.15]I think we lost him.
[86:57.21]Yeah, he doesn't care anymore.
[87:00.83]Okay, we'll make him care.
[87:02.47]I'm drinking the energy drink.
[87:03.51]Fuck it.
[87:03.77]I don't even know what it does.
[87:04.61]Is he coming back?
[87:11.83]Alright, he's a little angry, but he's not coming back yet.
[87:15.32]There he is.
[87:15.66]He's coming back.
[87:16.96]Alright, a little further.
[87:22.10]A little further.
[87:25.08]Don't go too far.
[87:25.74]Keep on him.
[87:26.20]Yeah, don't go too far.
[87:27.29]Alright, he's underwater.
[87:28.63]Alright, he's right underneath you.
[87:31.45]He's coming up.
[87:32.87]Here he comes.
[87:33.35]Splash.
[87:33.51]Alright, let's get a little closer.
[87:35.75]Make sure he knows that we're still here.
[87:41.03]Here he comes!
[87:41.63]Shoot!
[87:41.79]Oh, I think I used all my things.
[87:43.23]Shoot it!
[87:43.96]What do you mean shoot it?
[87:45.38]Shoot it!
[87:47.72]Oh, no!
[87:48.30]I gotta pick up more rocks!
[87:50.30]I would've fucking blown it up.
[87:52.82]I would've blown up right next to it.
[87:54.20]Where are the fire rocks?
[87:58.14]I mean, I have... All right.
[88:00.50]Can we pick this up?
[88:01.44]All right.
[88:01.86]No.
[88:02.40]Let's get him.
[88:03.62]We're going to waste bullets and ammo and drinks.
[88:08.79]Wait, wait.
[88:09.35]He's coming.
[88:09.65]He's coming.
[88:09.89]He's coming.
[88:10.15]Oh, there's seeds.
[88:12.63]He's like on his way back up here now.
[88:14.65]All right.
[88:14.95]Here he comes.
[88:16.21]He's almost here.
[88:16.67]No, I don't want sticky mud.
[88:20.20]I want rocks.
[88:21.26]Can I do it with bright moss?
[88:23.70]Wait until he gets like right on top of it.
[88:26.12]He's turning around.
[88:26.82]He doesn't care anymore.
[88:30.08]Let me find some more ammunition for my sling.
[88:33.90]If he leaves again, I'm going to be so mad.
[88:36.46]Like, if he leaves the entire map, you mean?
[88:38.27]Yeah, because I guess if you don't kill him in time, he just runs away.
[88:40.55]All right, there's Brightmoss.
[88:42.91]I have five Brightmoss.
[88:44.27]I think you can just, like, hit it, can't you?
[88:48.11]Brightmoss is just a light.
[88:49.81]Where's the one that does fire?
[88:56.00]All right, he's back up here again.
[88:57.66]He's coming to you.
[88:59.91]Alright, we're gonna try this one more time, and then we have to kill the boss.
[89:02.29]Alright, I think I got the one that does fire.
[89:03.55]I think I have the one that does fire.
[89:05.59]We're shaving useful time.
[89:07.67]He ran away.
[89:08.97]He's down here.
[89:09.41]Alright, he's almost up here.
[89:18.18]I've got 14 shots.
[89:20.34]I think we can just, like, touch it.
[89:21.46]Can't we just punch it or something?
[89:22.44]I'm pretty sure we can just punch it.
[89:27.23]Oh, there it goes.
[89:27.81]All right, that was 80 damage.
[89:30.01]I don't know if it's worth setting that up.
[89:33.58]I think it is.
[89:34.46]I think it's 80 damage.
[89:35.64]Come on.
[89:36.52]That's like a super crit.
[89:37.54]Yeah, well, 80 damage.
[89:38.40]He's already retreating.
[89:39.38]We could have done 500 damage by hitting him with our weapons.
[89:41.58]He's running away after one hit.
[89:42.68]I don't know if it was worth it.
[89:43.84]It did 80 damage.
[89:53.39]It was 80 critical face damage in his mouth.
[89:56.39]If you hit him in the face once with your swing, it would have done like 40.
[89:59.14]That's not true.
[90:01.12]Blatantly untrue.
[90:03.34]I just did right there.
[90:04.52]I just did like 60 damage.
[90:06.30]It was just blatantly not true.
[90:12.68]Oh, God damn it.
[90:13.92]I got other stuff too.
[90:15.10]I got other traps.
[90:20.22]Can't use Pitfall here, but that's okay.
[90:24.69]Where is he?
[90:25.81]Oh, there he is.
[90:28.61]Looks like he's looking at you.
[90:29.69]I planted a bomb!
[90:35.41]Oh, I don't want to do that to you.
[90:56.95]Now we're in business.
[90:58.17]Now we're in business.
[90:58.83]I want to do a charge.
[90:59.97]I gotta figure out how to use this item.
[91:01.59]That'd be helpful.
[91:04.49]Where's he going?
[91:14.05]I like that I'm actually doing water damage each time.
[91:16.55]I want to get him in the head.
[91:17.67]I feel like that's where I need to be.
[91:20.75]Alright, time for a nice sword attack.
[91:22.23]I wounded him.
[91:22.73]I broke his tail.
[91:28.56]Alright, he's like standing up now.
[91:32.50]Oh, he's running away.
[91:33.86]Maybe not.
[91:39.14]That's how you do that.
[91:39.96]Get some extra stamina.
[91:42.36]Come on.
[91:48.20]Come on.
[91:58.77]Alright, he's doing the roly poly.
[92:02.05]None of us can touch him because he just knocks you back immediately.
[92:10.17]Careful.
[92:11.25]Careful.
[92:11.61]He tried to get out.
[92:13.25]Break.
[92:13.91]He breaks like all the platforms.
[92:15.57]Alright, I need to take a potion.
[92:25.19]And I also need to... Shit.
[92:29.92]I need to, like, smash his head.
[92:31.04]Why me, though?
[92:34.35]I'm gonna die.
[92:38.85]Don't say that.
[92:39.51]Go for him!
[92:41.67]There's another target here.
[92:42.91]I thought I got him in the face.
[92:47.15]I did.
[92:49.95]All right, what else do I have?
[92:50.99]Oh, I need a whetstone.
[92:54.51]Oh, God.
[92:55.07]Okay, well, that's how you spin.
[92:58.50]That's how you do the spin move.
[93:00.46]Whoops, wrong button.
[93:03.46]Oh, come on.
[93:09.52]You gonna leave me alone yet?
[93:13.96]Are we both sharpening at the same time?
[93:15.62]Yeah, I think so.
[93:16.02]Do you need to sharpen that big bludgeon weapon that you got there?
[93:18.52]Apparently.
[93:19.10]The big round one?
[93:19.90]I guess you have to sharpen it.
[93:20.96]And lose a little bit of its edge?
[93:22.43]Hmm...
[93:29.67]Holy shit.
[93:34.09]Oh, you finally got through it.
[93:35.22]I guess so.
[93:36.16]I hit him right in the face and it got unadoptable.
[93:39.82]Uh, watch out.
[93:40.46]No, no, no.
[93:41.42]New guy.
[93:41.82]New guy.
[93:42.30]There's a new guy in this school.
[93:43.70]It's okay.
[93:44.18]We just did... Okay, it's not okay.
[93:47.29]It's not okay.
[93:48.37]It's not okay, but it's kind of okay because look how much... We just made a snack for him.
[93:52.55]What?
[93:52.83]Oh, come on.
[93:53.25]He roared right... You fucking little asshole.
[93:55.41]Oh, fuck that stupid asshole.
[93:57.27]Unbelievable.
[93:58.58]He roared white when you were doing the... That was so pointless.
[94:03.96]Oh, easy.
[94:04.40]Don't get angry.
[94:08.16]Guy just walked over here and just yelled and then ran away.
[94:10.25]Alright, he's leaving.
[94:11.69]He's leaving.
[94:12.15]I'm about to let go to do a move and he goes, No, you can't.
[94:17.81]Bye.
[94:18.17]I'm leaving.
[94:29.80]All right, this is where he fled last time.
[94:32.53]I got a trap.
[94:33.99]I'm gonna use a trap.
[94:35.27]I'm gonna put it, like, right here.
[94:37.75]I'm putting a trap.
[94:40.67]Why can't I put it down?
[94:42.77]I love that we've already accidentally slain two of the quest guys.
[94:46.63]Apparently.
[94:47.89]Not even trying.
[94:50.05]so how do you uh can the trap not be put down if um like on solid ground I think it's like about where more than it is about when I see okay all right I can I can put it up here he's turning around to face me I'm putting the trap here like up on this little hill see if we can just pull him over here he kind of hates me come over here wrap him into this shocker
[95:18.61]Come on over here, bud.
[95:19.67]Alright, I'll take the tail, you take the head.
[95:28.30]That's gonna take some getting used to.
[95:30.62]Where do I stand for that?
[95:36.54]I have no clue.
[95:39.44]Alright, well I killed another one of the mini-quests that we're supposed to be doing.
[95:43.86]If that counts for anything.
[95:52.38]I got knocked down at the end of my combo.
[95:54.46]I stunned him.
[96:04.49]I need to whetstone once more.
[96:06.57]I think we've got him on the ropes.
[96:08.48]Pretty much.
[96:10.08]Oh, you stupid fish.
[96:12.62]I'm going to kill this dumb fish that's down here.
[96:15.33]Yeah, they just knock us over like in the middle of town.
[96:17.54]There's like six of them.
[96:18.58]Why the fuck am I using the target lock?
[96:20.38]There's so many.
[96:21.66]I don't know.
[96:22.00]I turned it off.
[96:22.52]The target lock is seriously... You think it would be better?
[96:24.32]But it's like worse.
[96:25.02]It's like it's a thousand times worse.
[96:26.54]These things need to die.
[96:39.37]Alright, this has got it.
[96:40.09]Watch out underneath you.
[96:45.03]Get a little cocky here and get a little cocky just a little One would assume I would hope
[97:32.77]Music is too epic for him to run away now.
[97:37.31]Where am I?
[97:38.63]Get up!
[97:41.60]I forgot my combo.
[97:42.92]That was a deal.
[97:44.36]I just screwed that up.
[97:48.65]Of course.
[97:49.73]What the fuck else would happen?
[97:55.49]We will accidentally finish the quest.
[97:59.63]Ow.
[98:01.25]Or die.
[98:02.07]You know, that might happen too.
[98:03.25]Or die trying.
[98:04.27]Nope.
[98:11.51]Or he might just run away.
[98:12.65]Hey look, the most fucking annoying enemy in the game.
[98:19.67]Let's kill them.
[98:20.47]Are you sure it is?
[98:22.91]I just hate swamps.
[98:24.67]Just fuck swamps.
[98:26.07]Swamps just make me want to fucking die.
[98:27.65]I hate swamps in video games.
[98:29.27]I hate them.
[98:30.83]Well, we did accidentally complete the reason why we're here and we're returning to base in one minute.
[98:35.86]Any fucking part of a game where you have to sludge around in a swamp and shit makes me want to fucking cry.
[98:43.42]He's back.
[98:48.04]Why the fuck is there swamps in every one of these games?
[98:51.77]Hurry, we got 30 seconds.
[98:52.63]Wait, why do we only have 30 seconds?
[98:54.45]Because we did it.
[98:55.27]I told you, this is why I told you before we started this.
[98:58.11]Give me a fucking break.
[98:59.39]I said, let's do the little mission first and then attack the main boss.
[99:18.64]We're gonna go back, and this is gonna be all for nothing.
[99:21.95]Oh my god.
[99:22.79]I'm going to smash my controller into the ground.
[99:27.61]What the hell, man?
[99:28.67]What the fuck?
[99:29.59]Absolute hell.
[99:36.72]Yeah, please open up my notebook.
[99:38.00]We're watching my journal today.
[99:39.32]Oh my god.
[99:43.04]Hey, look at all this sweet loot we got.
[99:44.31]You gotta give me a break.
[99:48.00]Why wouldn't they just make it so you just if you want why can't it just complete it?
[99:54.73]Why do we have to go to this screen right now?
[100:15.27]Hey, look, I tried.
[100:16.37]I tried to warn you beforehand.
[100:19.66]I did.
[100:20.84]Well, we're fighting the guy in here with... I don't even... I didn't think that was going to do it.
[100:26.54]Those were the mission guys.
[100:28.49]I didn't think it was going to kick us out.
[100:31.69]Well, that's what... Before we started, I said, let's kill the little mission guys.
[100:35.29]Then we'll have free expedition, no timer or restrictions.
[100:39.34]God.
[100:42.68]So this is what happened.
[100:43.71]Now, if we run back, there's a chance that maybe he didn't get reset, but we don't know.
[100:48.37]He probably did.
[100:50.35]We finished the quest.
[100:51.59]But all right.
[100:52.05]So but if we just wanted to do free mode, just free mode together, we can't do that.
[100:57.77]Well, we're in free mode now.
[100:58.88]No, but I mean, like to start like you can't just start a fucking expedition together.
[101:02.82]Is that is that a true statement?
[101:04.85]uh you for some reason have to someone has to start an expedition then you have to fire an sos okay then you have to filter search for your friend's sos on the job board so you have to find your friend's session and look for their name and then you can join them it's uh it's a little it's a little complicated
[101:31.19]And by a little, I mean should be probably as easy as just starting an investigation together.
[101:44.36]All right, so what would you like to do?
[101:45.76]Uh...
[101:51.50]Do you want to do a story mission, or do you want to go fight that same guy again?
[101:55.36]We have to kill that fucking stupid thing.
[101:57.66]Like, let's just go over there now.
[101:59.08]We don't have a mission, right?
[101:59.92]It's not going to kick us out again, is it?
[102:01.83]It's not going to kick us out, but he can leave whenever he wants.
[102:04.85]Oh, God.
[102:08.89]Make sure you put a swamp in every video game.
[102:13.17]I don't mind the swamp, personally.
[102:15.36]Just put a swamp in every single video game.
[102:17.18]It's not as bad as the Dark Souls and Bloodborne ones.
[102:20.06]Because you don't have to do six hours of a level in it.
[102:23.68]You just have to fight a guy.
[102:24.64]How long have we been playing so far?
[102:25.88]Well, we haven't been fighting that guy for six hours.
[102:29.02]We've been playing for about two.
[102:31.05]We've been playing for an hour and a half.
[102:33.23]Kill those deer?
[102:34.21]No, they're innocent.
[102:42.62]I mean, we could go back to town and get a quest to specifically kill that thing, and that would guarantee that he wouldn't leave.
[102:49.43]Is that even available?
[102:51.61]We have to go back to town.
[102:52.45]Just go back to town.
[102:53.27]We would have to go back to town, but it would guarantee that the enemy doesn't leave, probably.
[103:16.09]Can you start the quest in the area?
[103:18.83]No, you must pick up the quest from the quest board.
[103:23.86]Guaranteed, probably.
[103:27.36]And then launch together on the quest.
[103:40.58]So yes, in a perfect world, you would be able to do things like start story campaign with your friend and never, ever leave them.
[103:48.38]That would be fucking, that would be amazing if you could do that.
[103:51.16]Unfortunately, it's not that easy.
[103:56.10]It would be great if I could just party with you and we could just do things instead of having to go back to the, back out, back in, back out, back in.
[104:02.86]It's like, come on.
[104:05.20]Is it really, is it that difficult just to let us stay together and do what we want to do together?
[104:13.20]Do we have to, like, go to, like, the fucking job board every time we want to play the game together?
[104:16.63]Ay caramba.
[104:22.33]Ay caramba.
[104:23.35]Okay, complete two quests, sure.
[104:28.26]Alright, let me, uh... And get bones.
[104:32.40]Let me get some potions.
[104:35.96]Well, since this is going to be a mission, they'll actually give us a few.
[104:39.30]Mm-mm.
[104:44.06]Get this out of my bag, please.
[104:45.48]All right.
[104:55.70]But yes, it would be a good idea to probably just bring some.
[104:58.78]I have some on me.
[105:01.10]I'll bring 10.
[105:05.72]Here's the job board.
[105:09.61]So we're doing a kill to capture that monster, right?
[105:12.83]We're gonna do what option is it optional or let's see Okay, so we have an optional quest to go back and do specifically the thing that we were about to do 50 minutes We can faint three times.
[105:31.68]So it's fairly generous And I am starting it now
[105:42.22]Are you in?
[105:44.68]Yeah, but hold on.
[105:45.40]Hold on.
[105:45.76]Don't accept.
[105:46.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[105:46.64]What do you mean?
[105:49.68]Because I want to do something.
[105:50.61]Okay, I canceled the quest.
[105:53.47]I'm going to one-up it.
[105:54.55]You know, we're going to raise the stakes a little bit here.
[105:56.99]Okay.
[105:58.87]I'm going to use one of my vouchers.
[106:02.25]You're going to do a voucher here?
[106:03.67]We're going to do a voucher here.
[106:06.02]We're going to make it interesting.
[106:07.66]We haven't done that before.
[106:08.70]I don't know what it does.
[106:10.02]Hopefully it's cool.
[106:12.89]How do I activate a voucher?
[106:15.57]Who the hell is this?
[106:20.46]This is the correct quest.
[106:23.08]Two players.
[106:24.04]Go to the options.
[106:25.40]Southwest.
[106:27.10]Toggle voucher.
[106:28.86]Use a lucky voucher.
[106:30.32]Yes.
[106:32.82]There we go.
[106:35.37]Now you can join.
[106:37.60]I think the voucher I use applies to you.
[106:39.75]I don't know if it makes it more difficult, but at the very least, I think it makes it more rewarding.
[106:46.29]The Piscine, whatever it is?
[106:47.97]Yes.
[106:48.93]Piscine or something.
[106:50.37]Yeah, that is what we're doing.
[106:52.24]Southwest.
[106:54.82]And then we're doing it for real.
[106:56.40]I didn't activate vouchers.
[106:57.82]Does that matter?
[106:58.34]I think it applies for you.
[106:59.76]This is like man up mode.
[107:01.08]Actually, it might not be any more difficult, but apparently you get a limited number for some reason.
[107:11.77]apparently it's just bonus loot there's no difficulty mod on it please wait
[107:54.92]Cat?
[107:55.24]I don't think we're playing with cats right now.
[108:00.08]We are currently not playing with cats.
[108:02.18]No, it's going to stay that way for now.
[108:04.66]Because otherwise everyone will just say, oh, you beat it with cats.
[108:07.35]Like you just beat it on the easy mode.
[108:09.13]Good job.
[108:09.57]All right.
[108:11.21]You had some helpers.
[108:12.19]Let's do this.
[108:12.79]Let's do this officially now.
[108:14.03]Yeah, this is official.
[108:15.81]This is official.
[108:16.89]Yeah.
[108:18.55]Isn't he just over here?
[108:22.68]Or did I go the wrong way?
[108:25.20]I'm just kind of walking.
[108:35.19]I mean, we fight in this swamp, correct?
[108:38.51]And it's just beyond it to the east?
[108:41.05]There's Mr. Tyrannosaurus Hammerhead Sharkhead.
[108:46.39]I think we don't go in the cave.
[108:49.93]No, he's, like, down here, isn't he?
[108:51.65]Isn't he, like, in one of these little areas down at, like, nine?
[108:56.50]Yeah, I think he's, like, over beyond nine.
[109:00.02]Yeah, I see him slithering around already.
[109:03.28]He's already back here.
[109:05.91]Okey-doke.
[109:08.97]I'm going to take a ration and then some nutrients.
[109:11.69]Oh, yeah, good idea.
[109:12.07]We should have done food.
[109:13.87]Yeah, we got in a hurry.
[109:14.79]Oh, well.
[109:15.21]We're just in a hurry.
[109:20.74]It's all right.
[109:23.66]Let's kill this thing.
[109:24.68]I did bring a mega nutrient, though.
[109:28.61]The trouble this thing has caused us for no reason.
[109:31.09]Honest to God.
[109:31.79]All right.
[109:34.57]Standing by.
[109:36.39]Whenever you're ready.
[109:37.65]I'm pretty much ready to go.
[109:39.55]Okay.
[109:43.33]This is going to be the most efficient killing of this monster you've ever seen in your life.
[109:49.99]Don't say that I want to do the piranhas in here we can actually kill them without having to be teleported to the deck back to the camp So we should probably probably do that do that Yeah
[110:19.23]I'm drinking an energy drink.
[110:20.09]Careful.
[110:20.51]Watch out.
[110:20.85]He's about to pop up.
[110:22.04]Popping up.
[110:23.96]I warned you.
[110:26.10]I hate this place.
[110:31.60]Just drink it and stop popping up underneath me for Christ's sake.
[110:34.63]He's popping up underneath me this time.
[110:36.35]You're good.
[110:48.02]There we go.
[110:48.78]That's the stuff.
[110:50.70]Easy now.
[110:53.32]That's the stuff.
[110:57.28]Coming for me.
[110:57.82]Moon right.
[110:59.64]Oh, right in his mouth.
[111:03.84]He's gonna eat me.
[111:06.39]I hit the fish next to him, apparently.
[111:10.85]Careful.
[111:11.61]Careful.
[111:11.81]Here's the tail.
[111:13.13]Yep, tail whip.
[111:13.89]Get the tail whip.
[111:21.63]Who's he going for?
[111:22.17]For you!
[111:25.20]Is he?
[111:28.46]Better stay away from him.
[111:32.11]I'm making sure not to.
[111:32.93]Yeah, we need to stay over here.
[111:40.37]I got bumped by... It's at that point where literally anything is getting me angry.
[111:46.61]I got bumped by one of those fishes and you may as well have... I got rear-ended by somebody at a red light.
[111:53.64]That's how I just felt.
[111:56.86]Somebody may as well just ran into my car.
[111:58.44]Yeah.
[112:02.90]Did we just collide?
[112:03.82]I think we just, like, our powers.
[112:05.86]Yes, we just did, like, the bounce-back special move, where we each use our special attack at the same time.
[112:17.62]You actually got your car bumped there.
[112:19.46]I actually bumped your car.
[112:21.37]Yeah, I'm going to bump you.
[112:25.19]We could just get eaten at the same time.
[112:27.43]It's fine.
[112:27.97]I just hit you with my car.
[112:28.73]We're pretty good at this.
[112:31.68]I'm irredeemable.
[112:32.59]I'm irredeemable tilt right now.
[112:33.93]Like, it's irredeemable.
[112:34.83]I might as well pick up a deck of cards and start using them on stream.
[112:40.65]Yeah, like, go to, like, off-schedule Saturday stream where I fucking shove a deck of cards up my ass.
[112:50.76]God.
[112:58.85]Let me do my special move.
[113:05.50]Nice magic trick.
[113:11.54]Alright, time to whetstone.
[113:12.34]I'm gonna need to do that very shortly here too.
[113:15.72]Just do it in the swamp, I can take fire.
[113:27.90]You know what I need to do?
[113:28.96]This is honestly the first time I've really ever used this weapon.
[113:32.88]I need to actually know how to use it.
[113:35.26]Yeah, that does sound important.
[113:38.06]We're like fucking 10 hours into the game and I'm like, what a different weapon.
[113:42.10]Alright, just destroy the body part.
[113:44.74]Or whatever that's worth.
[113:46.40]So he may try to do a little tactical retreat.
[113:52.81]Progress, progress.
[114:13.64]Progress.
[114:16.94]All we gotta do is keep breaking body parts.
[114:19.95]And then he will die.
[114:24.45]Slithering around.
[114:26.95]Sharpen the handle quick.
[114:29.81]Actually, you know what?
[114:30.41]I am gonna go ahead and whetstone.
[114:33.02]That's probably not a good idea right now.
[114:38.39]You broke apart?
[114:43.18]Give me a little space.
[114:45.76]What?
[114:46.02]Did I just seriously fall in the mud?
[114:47.82]I didn't even see it.
[114:50.68]I'm so locked in.
[114:52.00]Uh-oh.
[114:52.22]Tyrannosaurus Rex friend is here.
[114:54.34]Of course he is.
[114:56.92]Maybe they'll do a little fighting together again.
[114:58.64]Yep.
[115:00.64]435 damage with that attack.
[115:03.78]I'm scared to go over there now.
[115:05.66]Yeah.
[115:06.96]He's biting his neck.
[115:10.58]500, he just helped us a lot.
[115:13.94]That's like, that's like seven explosive barrels.
[115:17.16]It really is.
[115:19.32]Is he running away again?
[115:20.04]He's running away again.
[115:20.72]Don't, don't, we gotta watch out for here, because this is not good.
[115:25.13]I think they're still not done.
[115:27.03]Are they not done?
[115:27.55]I don't know.
[115:33.11]Shit.
[115:41.92]Stupid tail whip.
[115:43.08]I know.
[115:52.99]Oh, he's going around.
[115:56.81]Trying to get some, like, cheeky hits on him, but it ain't working.
[115:59.29]There we go.
[116:04.45]No, don't look at me.
[116:05.99]Oh, he looked at me.
[116:16.68]Why?
[116:18.28]No, don't do it.
[116:19.24]Please don't.
[116:19.64]He's gonna do it.
[116:20.18]Uh, yeah.
[116:26.88]He is.
[116:28.30]You mounted the monster.
[116:30.44]Keep him busy.
[116:33.26]One.
[116:33.72]One.
[116:34.24]One.
[116:34.94]Race.
[116:35.88]Race for impact.
[116:39.58]Do I get points for, like, riding the wild fucking bronco thing?
[116:50.53]I'm losing, like, stamina.
[116:52.13]You do get points, actually.
[116:55.23]Alright, I fell off.
[117:04.62]I need to, like, aim this correctly.
[117:08.52]There it is.
[117:09.36]My turn.
[117:11.77]My turn.
[117:12.67]That was pretty good.
[117:13.67]Ah, fuck, I missed it.
[117:14.47]I need to do some whetstone.
[117:16.15]Yes, I do too.
[117:18.22]Where's he going?
[117:19.74]He's thinking about attacking me.
[117:21.32]He's thinking about it?
[117:22.72]Yeah, he's not really sure yet.
[117:24.30]There he goes.
[117:24.82]Alright, I'm distracting him so you can whetstone.
[117:28.87]Now he's kind of just riding off into the swamp a little further.
[117:34.69]He's coming back to you.
[117:36.73]Looks like.
[117:38.53]Oh, he's rolling around.
[117:46.83]Almost had a nice little combo there.
[117:49.21]We got to be close to getting into the next form.
[117:52.77]I would hope so.
[117:54.31]Right in the middle of my mega potion.
[118:04.05]Fuck.
[118:04.33]Coming back in.
[118:17.94]He's underwater.
[118:22.22]There's items on the ground here.
[118:26.66]I'm running out of health, too.
[118:28.46]Potions.
[118:31.22]There's material over here.
[118:32.96]Although I just got it, so... Another idea.
[118:48.09]What's he doing?
[118:48.53]I don't know.
[118:51.27]What is he doing?
[118:53.97]Oh, come on.
[118:54.43]You should be able to bounce him like that.
[118:56.79]Gun aside.
[119:03.09]Easy.
[119:04.61]Did I do that to you?
[119:05.61]Did I hurt you?
[119:06.33]No.
[119:07.55]T-Rex is back.
[119:10.79]Just FYI.
[119:12.50]That might be good for us, though.
[119:13.68]They might fight each other or something.
[119:15.67]They're both rolling around at the same time!
[119:17.28]What are they doing?
[119:17.96]Why?
[119:18.62]Hey!
[119:19.52]Are you friends now?
[119:20.54]You can't be on the same team!
[119:22.38]Alright, the odds are already stacked against us enough.
[119:27.16]These guys can't be on the same team now.
[119:28.56]Where's he going?
[119:29.06]Oh, he's running away!
[119:29.76]Go back to the swamp.
[119:32.30]Alright, I need a wetsuit again.
[119:33.26]And, like, I needed to get rid of this, so I have to put it down.
[119:36.26]Put it down.
[119:37.04]Put it... Are you getting chased?
[119:39.32]No, he's running.
[119:40.04]I had a full charge, and you have to let go of it.
[119:54.42]Alright.
[119:55.14]This is it.
[119:56.28]Time for him to die.
[120:10.09]And... What now?
[120:11.89]Are you here?
[120:12.53]I'm here.
[120:12.77]Okay, let's do it.
[120:19.84]After those, get in some mud real quick.
[120:23.38]And...
[120:33.22]Watch it No, no, I'm just saying what you saved you getting hit by the tail but I'm inside of his like fucking diarrhea.
[120:39.96]Hold on All right, I need to switch to sword mode I do so much more damage on him like that No, don't run away.
[120:52.70]What's he doing?
[120:53.18]Why did the music stop?
[120:54.10]It's freaking me out Nobody's doing
[121:03.39]Fucking fish.
[121:10.23]Where the hell am I?
[121:15.63]Hi, sorry.
[121:16.07]What was that explosion?
[121:17.59]That was me trying to do damage.
[121:20.03]I don't know if I hit him though.
[121:23.34]I'd like to think I did.
[121:24.24]He's standing up.
[121:30.36]He's kind of being passive right now.
[121:39.37]Probably it's a good time to whetstone while he does the roll.
[121:48.53]Yeah, it is.
[121:49.11]It's sort of like supercharged right now.
[121:56.64]Speaking of whetstone, hope I have enough time to use it.
[121:59.68]I think you do because you went for me.
[122:08.39]All right, my turn.
[122:15.86]Oh, nope.
[122:20.64]Where are you?
[122:21.84]Where is he?
[122:22.32]Going for you.
[122:24.28]Oh, I thought he like faked me out so bad.
[122:27.38]I saw the little thing in front of the water in front of me splashing around.
[122:35.84]All right, am I losing my mind?
[122:37.12]We beat this guy so easily last time.
[122:40.12]Remember last night?
[122:42.48]This guy was simple.
[122:44.65]We beat him first fucking try.
[122:46.81]Yeah.
[122:47.03]Yeah.
[122:59.93]You know what I'm saying?
[123:00.55]God, I have to put stuff.
[123:01.59]I mean, you got killed once, but is that really... Is anyone counting now?
[123:04.79]I think I died in the first one, too.
[123:13.50]He's using water weapons.
[123:17.68]That's probably one of the things that's happening.
[123:19.98]Of course, like, the one thing that... I'm gonna make this a weapon.
[123:23.68]Yeah, what if the fact that we're both using water weapons, it's, like, empowering him or something stupid?
[123:28.50]I wouldn't be surprised.
[123:31.82]Something broke.
[123:36.17]Uh, hopefully that's a good sign.
[123:37.19]Oh man, that's just not fair.
[123:41.01]I'm gonna die.
[123:41.55]I mean, I'm getting really good hits.
[123:48.23]He's just... He's on the way.
[123:49.93]He's gonna move again.
[123:50.79]I think this might be the final push.
[123:53.96]Well, I hope we can kill him now.
[123:57.72]Wow, he's stopping.
[123:58.80]He's not running away.
[124:00.96]He's just getting a little... He's wounded.
[124:02.56]He's stumbling into a belly flop.
[124:07.94]I think he started to run away and he was just too injured.
[124:10.08]So this is like where he goes back to rest and heal in his normal spot.
[124:14.03]I think we got him on the ropes finally.
[124:17.93]Finally?
[124:18.45]I probably said that like seven times now.
[124:20.41]We got him on the ropes.
[124:21.01]It's good to be optimistic.
[124:32.77]Alright, he's dead.
[124:35.20]We are never fighting this monster ever again.
[124:37.42]I don't care if he has the best gear in the whole fucking game.
[124:39.36]I will never fight this monster again.
[124:42.04]Alright, well make sure you skin him.
[124:44.72]Because we are on a mission.
[124:45.90]So get your resources at least.
[124:58.08]It's not that this was that difficult.
[125:00.36]It's just that it was...
[125:03.30]It's hard to do because of circumstances beyond our control.
[125:08.36]Like, the first time we fought, he ran away.
[125:13.80]The second time we fought, we accidentally completed a mission, right?
[125:18.99]And it ended the game.
[125:21.05]And now... Sticky mud.
[125:22.23]Now we beat him for real.
[125:26.69]Hey, look, I got a scale for that.
[125:28.21]Cool.
[125:28.41]Cool.
[125:32.25]I don't know if I'm fishing minigame that was.
[125:35.17]I'm gonna go to... Probably gonna put the dual welding back on.
[125:40.03]The dual welding?
[125:40.78]Yep.
[125:42.00]Just doing so much more damage.
[125:44.64]It's easier to move around.
[125:45.58]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[125:52.02]Did you learn any combos for the... Dual weld?
[125:56.13]No, for the... For the hammer.
[125:57.89]For the hammer.
[126:01.51]I know a few of them.
[126:03.51]If you go to first charge, you can do... There's combos for the first charge, combos for the second charge.
[126:08.93]You can stand still and let go.
[126:10.15]I don't know.
[126:24.20]Apparently, monsters are much harder.
[126:28.78]outside of their storyline quests, apparently.
[126:40.64]I'm gonna put these back on.
[126:47.15]The beaks.
[126:56.18]Mm.
[127:21.61]Oh, yeah, you can just equip that from the supply box.
[127:24.73]No, from the camp.
[127:34.20]So, would you like to do a story mission and move to a new monster?
[127:39.78]Um, yes.
[127:41.10]Let's do that.
[127:42.98]So that we can tell everyone we're over our personal vendetta now.
[127:48.82]It only took us two hours, but that's okay.
[127:52.30]That's what the whole point of the game is.
[127:55.27]Talk until you get good.
[127:57.59]That sounds like the name of the game.
[127:59.51]So let's go back and do a story mission.
[128:07.55]Exit here.
[128:09.03]Return for expedition.
[128:09.67]All right, you can post a new quest from the lady.
[128:11.69]Oh, shit.
[128:17.96]So, despite the fact... Okay, so part of what I said earlier was true, which is you cannot start an expedition with a friend without first...
[128:28.04]posting a quest or an investigation but you don't have to go back to post a new one once you're there.
[128:35.40]So the actual act of starting an expedition with a friend is still as difficult as I intonate it.
[128:42.27]Is that a word?
[128:43.21]I think it is.
[128:45.20]However, continuing quests is a little easier.
[128:48.98]But since we both have to do a story quest anyway, we probably should start it separately, right?
[128:53.53]Here's the complex part again.
[128:55.23]Start it separately, watch the cutscene, and then we'll rejoin each other.
[128:57.93]Sounds good.
[128:59.11]So we still have to start separately, even though we both have the same quest.
[129:06.23]Because you're not allowed to watch a cutscene together.
[129:11.49]We're going to do Flying Sparks to Toby Kodachi.
[129:14.95]Okie dokie.
[129:15.83]Actually, hang on.
[129:16.41]It requires hunter rank four or higher.
[129:18.89]What is our hunter rank?
[129:21.11]Because the last ones we've been doing have been hunter rank three or higher.
[129:24.55]So this is like next level.
[129:29.21]Close the book.
[129:30.67]All right, so I was looking at the combos for the dual blades.
[129:34.81]Oh, we are.
[129:35.17]I am hunter rank four.
[129:36.21]What's your hunter rank in your equipment?
[129:39.77]Four.
[129:41.62]So start the quest, see the cutscene, and leave.
[129:44.34]All right.
[129:45.85]uh yeah I'll I'll I don't mind leaving so I'm gonna just flying sparks and then make sure you set two players two players and then just okay whatever doesn't matter except the quest here we go all right joinable after departure see it says it right there depart
[130:18.48]It's just reading right now about demon form making sure I know somewhat what the fuck I'm doing
[130:54.75]So, I don't think there was a cutscene.
[130:59.79]That may be true, but it did tell me before I departed that I will only be joinable after departing.
[131:06.36]Okay.
[131:08.14]So, should we just try again now?
[131:11.06]Now that I loaded in, let's see if I can join you from the board.
[131:17.30]Should I put out, like, an SOS?
[131:18.86]This mission, we're supposed to be using the, uh, the camouflage net.
[131:24.31]Oh, like the ghillie suit?
[131:25.81]Yeah.
[131:28.25]Uh, yeah.
[131:29.79]Okay, so I can't talk to her to join a quest.
[131:33.77]So, she's no longer a quest giver once we're out of the expedition zone.
[131:40.11]So, I do, in fact, have, look, can you launch an SOS or no?
[131:45.55]Uh, can I launch an SOS?
[131:48.09]It will be available after the cutscene, etc.
[131:50.93]Do we just have to find it, see the cutscene, and then we can play together?
[131:55.53]Yes, make sure you have the ghillie mantle.
[131:59.95]I got it on.
[132:04.37]And only after that will we be able to play together.
[132:11.31]Hopefully.
[132:14.54]I wish we could just play together now.
[132:17.60]I know, I miss you too.
[132:18.52]Alright, hunt this guy to see the cutscene.
[132:25.45]Understood.
[132:27.55]Feels like just yesterday we were killing swamp crocodiles together.
[132:31.49]I know, really.
[132:32.03]I need to have, like... I don't have any... Let me take a ration.
[132:42.58]Oh yeah, I forgot to check that.
[132:44.52]I'm gonna be depleting stamina like crazy with these blades.
[132:51.87]Yeah, the blades seem like the key is probably just keeping them sharp.
[132:56.07]Keep them sharp when you have to manage stamina, because when you go in a demon form it just drains.
[133:03.71]Oh, old footprints.
[133:05.51]That could be where the dinosaur is.
[133:14.80]OK, getting warmer.
[133:16.87]Where were those?
[133:19.67]Found the trail.
[133:23.35]The worst part about this is this is a major improvement from previous games for the multiplayer.
[133:34.52]I guess it's, well, I'm not going to say anything.
[133:38.89]I'm not going to say anything.
[133:39.79]This is going to start a problem.
[133:42.65]But like, honestly, it's fucking 2018.
[133:44.29]What the hell?
[133:47.47]I think I found the guy.
[133:48.67]It's 2018.
[133:49.41]I can understand maybe like 2006.
[133:54.80]But like, what's the deal here?
[134:04.54]It's the current year.
[134:06.62]I wasn't as camouflaged as I first thought.
[134:09.55]fuck it is 2005 you're right uh well I may have found the monster but I also maybe got away that's not the monster we were looking for though we're looking for the tobi kadachi the game was in development since 2006 that's why they have like this convoluted multiplayer you know that's so that's so crazy that I would actually believe that
[134:34.64]Unfortunately, the bad truth is this game has been in development for four years instead of 12.
[134:40.11]What year was that?
[134:41.03]2012?
[134:41.05]2013?
[134:41.19]2014, I think, is when development started in earnest.
[134:48.23]2001?
[134:50.11]Yeah, 2001.
[134:50.53]All right.
[134:52.29]What was the multiplayer like in video games in 2014?
[134:56.94]Let's find out best games of 2014.
[134:59.92]What was the best multiplayer game of 2014?
[135:04.02]That was the year of Hearthstone.
[135:07.04]Look at Hearthstone's matchmaking.
[135:08.16]It was easy.
[135:10.96]Far Cry 4, Mario Kart 8, Titanfall, and Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.
[135:18.55]There are really not a lot of great examples here.
[135:21.39]2014 was not a very good year for gaming.
[135:27.42]Shit.
[135:38.95]That's when Team Fortress came up.
[135:46.31]Smoke nuts.
[135:49.89]Just pick up random shit that I see.
[135:51.91]Whatever.
[135:55.89]Whatever.
[135:57.48]I'll find them eventually.
[135:58.72]I'll find them eventually.
[135:59.84]I just sniff so my scout flies know what to do.
[136:02.84]I'm not even a real hunter.
[136:04.02]I just depend on my scout flies for everything.
[136:06.98]I know, really.
[136:07.98]Without them, I'd be lost.
[136:10.46]Without these scout flies, what the hell would I... What would we even do?
[136:15.24]We'd just wander around for 30, 45 minutes looking for the monster we want.
[136:19.51]There he is.
[136:22.87]Do you need PlayStation Plus?
[136:24.57]Yes, you do.
[136:25.75]To play multiplayer, but you can play the whole game in offline.
[136:28.47]Yep.
[136:35.20]Still charging $60 a year to play games in multiplayer.
[136:40.50]Even Nintendo is going to do it now.
[136:43.02]So we're at the lizard bird.
[136:44.79]I am at the cut scene.
[136:47.91]Yes.
[136:51.67]It's me.
[136:52.53]You can now use the SOS flare.
[136:55.86]So what's the plan here?
[136:57.18]You want to just back out or what?
[137:01.35]I will back out and join on you.
[137:03.96]This guy is... Are you, like, fighting him right now?
[137:06.12]I mean, I'm just here.
[137:07.12]This dude is electric, though, so I don't know if he will have any gear that's... He looks like he's electric.
[137:11.54]Does that mean he's going to be strong against our water?
[137:14.86]Oh, no.
[137:16.00]Actually, it should be the reverse.
[137:17.00]All right, you want me to shoot the... Want me to shoot the flare?
[137:22.50]Or is that going to be hard for you to do?
[137:24.01]Yeah, go ahead and shoot it.
[137:25.47]I wonder if I can... It's going to be hard to do this.
[137:29.55]I have to, like, run away from it.
[137:33.70]You can't hurt me!
[137:35.18]Don't you know I've left this quest?
[137:38.16]You're gonna have to find a new guy to eat.
[137:43.15]Alright, firing the SOS.
[137:44.31]There it goes.
[137:48.27]Alright, I have shot it out in the air.
[137:50.35]Although I don't really have any potions or anything.
[137:52.93]Don't fall off!
[138:04.99]Ah, it didn't go out.
[138:06.07]I hit the fucking tree.
[138:10.93]Although, I don't really have potions.
[138:12.37]This might be a bad idea.
[138:19.52]Can you see it?
[138:20.26]I will be loading in soon.
[138:21.64]Okay, well, I have four potions.
[138:23.66]Alright, while I load into your quest... Cool music.
[138:36.42]This is gonna be like this.
[138:37.68]This is gonna.
[138:38.18]This is just stupid like I'm gonna be running around getting hit, okay Yeah, yeah, yeah, what did you have how many portions you have I'm departing I will be picking up more from the chest because I have like six I've got like four on me five on me.
[138:55.23]I think plus a couple mega potions all right.
[138:57.17]It's loading in I'll be right back cuz it's gonna take like three minutes to load No
[139:10.51]Can I just, like, hide with the ghillie suit?
[139:12.07]Is that a thing?
[139:12.51]Gonna, like, hide in the corner and just use it.
[139:16.13]Let's, like, go down here.
[139:16.89]Yeah, here we go.
[139:21.71]Look, I'm a bush.
[139:27.91]Hey, it worked.
[139:29.95]Just pause the game.
[139:30.85]There is no pause.
[139:41.93]I can't pause the game.
[139:49.64]Why not just start fighting it?
[139:50.84]Well, because the monster now is like three times more difficult.
[139:56.57]The monster now has more health.
[139:58.13]So it would be a bad idea for me to just go start attacking him because the monster is going to be harder to kill.
[140:02.61]So I would be wasting my time.
[140:04.69]I need to wait for a Talix to get here so we can double co-op him.
[140:08.65]How much more health does the monster have when it turns to multiplayer?
[140:17.69]So?
[140:18.87]Who cares?
[140:19.45]What do you mean, so?
[140:25.42]It's going to take me like twice as long to do the amount of damage that we could do together.
[140:33.28]It's like 2.8.
[140:33.60]Hey, I'm here.
[140:34.03]Hey, okay.
[140:38.79]Now, are you actually here, or are you pretend here?
[140:41.83]No, I'm like, my character's in the game.
[140:44.21]Since we're about to do a boss fight, you know, just wait for me.
[140:45.95]I'm just going to have a nice meal, all right?
[140:47.69]I'd like a meat platter, please.
[140:49.71]Okay.
[140:50.89]Actually, maybe I'll do defense up this time.
[140:54.48]And then I will be running to you shortly.
[140:58.52]I have the ghillie suit on, but I'm not sure what it's even for, what it's even doing.
[141:02.59]I think it hides you so if you need to reprieve away from the monster you can like he will completely lose sight of you when you put it on okay temporarily that's weird it's just on I don't have to take it off just permanently here really yeah I guess yeah like I'm wondering oh okay if you attack yeah you can probably like run around with it but you can't you can't actually do anything you can run around with it on and it's on a cooldown
[141:38.62]All right, I see him.
[141:40.72]Are you engaged?
[141:42.12]No, I was waiting for you.
[141:43.08]All right, well, I am here and ready to go.
[141:45.64]All right, so you're at the monster?
[141:46.68]He sees me.
[141:47.28]He's like, hold on.
[141:48.24]I have to, like, go find him again because he flew from the other side.
[141:51.62]I gotta go this way.
[141:53.64]No, wrong way.
[141:54.76]Can I, like... Does it want me to go down?
[141:59.11]Are you down?
[141:59.71]I wasn't, like, even fucking paying attention.
[142:03.69]I am currently down.
[142:06.41]Okay, so apparently I am now, too.
[142:10.48]He's running right by me, but I can track him, and I'm hot on his tail.
[142:16.56]All right, I'm here.
[142:18.74]Well, he's not, so keep running.
[142:22.07]Is he gonna, like, run into me?
[142:24.17]I feel like he's gonna be in this hole that I come out of here.
[142:25.97]Oh, he's right there, okay.
[142:28.65]Where are you?
[142:30.19]Did he just jump all the way back up there?
[142:32.29]Yeah, he did.
[142:33.83]So he's coming back to where I just was.
[142:35.35]Oh, man.
[142:37.39]Yes.
[142:38.62]All right.
[142:39.78]I'm going back.
[142:40.68]This is climbable.
[142:44.64]He's actually, you know, he's just in this cave.
[142:47.40]He's just hanging out down here.
[142:53.64]I don't know where I'm going, but that was cool nonetheless.
[142:56.60]He's at 12.
[143:00.45]Apparently, I have become Tarzan.
[143:09.30]That's pretty sick, actually.
[143:10.90]He's now just going back up to his nest area, it seems.
[143:15.03]All right.
[143:15.25]Well, the fireflies seem a little confused as to where I'm supposed to go.
[143:19.27]If you go down and you go through the little cave system, it's like a waterfall you can go through, kind of.
[143:25.09]Is he up or down?
[143:26.07]He is now up.
[143:27.45]He's going up to between 12 and... There's like a little spot between 12 and... Let's see what exactly it is.
[143:37.44]Between 12 and 9, like in the middle there, there's like a vine system that he's going up right now.
[143:41.52]Okay.
[143:43.96]And hey, look at you.
[143:45.26]I believe I'm here.
[143:46.32]I think you're here.
[143:47.92]I believe we're ready to rock and roll.
[143:50.85]Because now he's up there.
[143:53.59]I'm going to take a ration.
[143:58.47]Hey, I got mega potions.
[143:59.67]That's good.
[144:02.53]So now he's sleeping.
[144:04.31]Oh, he's going back over here.
[144:07.77]All right.
[144:08.93]Engage the monster.
[144:13.51]Oh, so there is a time limit on how long we can be incognito with that thing.
[144:17.72]You can't just wear it indefinitely.
[144:19.02]It has to recharge.
[144:20.44]All right, let's do it.
[144:24.84]Let's kill blue Pikachu.
[144:31.09]He doesn't even care.
[144:33.57]He will.
[144:34.89]He will very shortly here.
[144:38.48]Well, there's the battle roar.
[144:39.64]And time to learn some new moves.
[144:43.43]Like the electric tail whip that he just did.
[144:46.85]He looks like he fights backwards, I think.
[144:55.76]Because like... Whoa!
[145:00.64]And he's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[145:02.40]Both of them are gone.
[145:03.48]He knocked you off the cliff and then jumped down.
[145:07.27]He's coming down.
[145:07.95]Why is he coming down to me?
[145:10.05]Do I need to come down there and fight?
[145:12.19]No, he's coming back to you.
[145:14.43]So, remember that invisible wall that we thought there was on ledges?
[145:17.25]That don't exist here.
[145:18.65]That's not real.
[145:20.38]There is a place to fall.
[145:24.87]Ah shit, I was trying to turn it off and not turn it back on, fuck
[145:53.83]I was trying to turn the Demon Blades off and not put them back on.
[145:59.80]Damn it.
[146:03.28]Tail seems pretty vulnerable.
[146:06.36]Until he does that.
[146:07.00]All right.
[146:16.59]I really wish he would attack you for a minute.
[146:23.33]I'm like electrocuted right now.
[146:26.92]I'm trying to take mega nutrients before I just die.
[146:30.40]I'm gonna jump downwards real quick.
[146:32.04]Watch out, he's gonna do a weird blasty thingy.
[146:37.90]Is he coming for me?
[146:38.60]No, I don't think so.
[146:42.28]Wowly shit!
[146:43.36]Dude, he almost killed me in one hit.
[146:45.48]Yeah, I know.
[146:45.82]I didn't even know where the fuck he even went.
[146:47.06]I'm jumping down.
[146:47.54]No, I'm not.
[146:47.98]I'm gonna die.
[146:49.68]That killed me in almost one swing.
[146:51.00]I didn't even know where it was.
[146:52.92]Yeah, I think our armor, this might be the first time we really need to do electric armor.
[146:57.74]Probably.
[146:59.28]You know what I mean?
[147:01.06]This guy seems like a lot to handle compared to the last.
[147:06.47]Oh, well, I'm done.
[147:08.43]Yeah, we can't, we ain't doing this.
[147:10.07]We ain't gonna do this shit.
[147:12.09]Yeah.
[147:12.21]I kind of figured this was gonna be tough.
[147:17.45]That was almost a 100% death again.
[147:22.59]Well, all right.
[147:27.88]He's a little squirrely.
[147:29.30]Just a little.
[147:33.67]So we may have found the first boss that we need to, like, really prepare for.
[147:38.23]Yeah.
[147:38.47]Yeah.
[147:43.79]We can still keep fighting on this.
[147:45.09]There's no reason not to.
[147:45.63]It's not like we lose all of our gear.
[147:47.25]No.
[147:48.41]I don't have any potions, like, either.
[147:49.57]This is kind of a wash.
[147:51.61]This is a wash.
[147:55.11]Look, you know what?
[147:56.58]You know what I'm going to say here?
[147:57.90]I'm going to complain again.
[147:59.44]Oh, no.
[148:01.42]The flying squirrel attack's awesome.
[148:04.44]No, I'm not going to.
[148:06.86]We weren't prepared for this to begin with.
[148:08.48]Like, SOS, run around.
[148:10.00]Get out here.
[148:10.46]Where are you?
[148:12.01]If we from the very beginning can like actually prepare.
[148:14.34]Well, here's what happened.
[148:15.76]I think you may have been doing something beforehand, but this is the first quest that has upped the recommended hunter level from 3 to 4.
[148:24.92]Right.
[148:26.80]So we have been up till now doing hunter ranking 3 missions.
[148:30.39]This is hunter rank 4.
[148:33.01]And we just turned rank 4.
[148:38.81]This is true.
[148:42.63]I was doing okay there for a second He seems like he's just standing still Turn it off Need the cats for this one we're gonna need those cats we need the catch for this one I
[149:10.70]Ghillie mantle can be used now.
[149:12.19]So if you get really damaged you can like hide Move out of the way don't get hit by the tail He's like freaking me out Come on why is he just like standing still for you?
[149:32.40]Did we?
[149:37.48]come on that was my final move and you had to roar as I was running away I don't think we're gonna kill him here we might just get I don't know that was some pretty good damage that we were doing and I have no healing you have none at all no I had I've used six potions you're running around in like circles no I took a wrong turn somewhere
[150:01.54]I feel like this might be doable, but I also went the wrong way.
[150:05.40]Now we've got a great jaguar here.
[150:08.34]Great jaguar?
[150:09.62]We're fighting.
[150:12.66]He's going to instantly kill this guy.
[150:17.70]Where is he going?
[150:18.38]I don't know.
[150:19.66]I'm not sure.
[150:22.40]Yeah, I'm having trouble keeping up right now.
[150:30.25]Mm-hmm.
[150:32.47]Flying squirrel.
[150:33.21]Oh, that's another guy.
[150:34.43]Don't want to fight him at the moment.
[150:37.29]Oh my god.
[150:40.90]I was playing that super cautious to it.
[150:42.68]That tail whip is like almost guaranteed like 95% health.
[150:45.20]Well, now that you're dead, the game's not over since we're on a mission.
[150:49.32]No.
[150:50.68]What you should do is pick up stuff from the chest and you can restock.
[150:55.33]I'm just going to keep him busy so he doesn't heal.
[150:58.19]I'm going to craft some stuff I'm going to eat too.
[151:03.90]Item box we got.
[151:06.82]Do I even have anything in here that's worth taking?
[151:08.74]Let's see.
[151:13.37]No, I need to make, like, potions.
[151:15.97]I have one potion.
[151:18.61]Come on, man.
[151:20.63]No, this is bad.
[151:29.44]Got this.
[151:29.82]You got this.
[151:30.46]Come on.
[151:31.16]Another one.
[151:33.63]Mega nutrients.
[151:36.49]Well, I can come back a little bit with stuff here.
[151:38.27]I wonder what equipment-wise.
[151:41.90]He's fighting a gilla monster.
[151:44.10]We have an ally.
[151:45.24]Versus thunder.
[151:46.12]Oh, maybe not.
[151:47.40]Maybe they both want to kill me now.
[151:50.50]I can't tell.
[151:50.94]I can't tell what's happening.
[151:55.74]They are both spazzing out.
[151:58.04]Just let them hurt each other.
[151:59.02]Alright, the gilla's running away.
[152:03.41]That's fine.
[152:08.72]There we go.
[152:09.18]Get some good hits.
[152:11.48]Item box.
[152:20.67]Take it all.
[152:21.19]Can't even get a hit.
[152:27.38]I need to get rid of some of this just trash easy ration poison knife.
[152:31.06]I guess I'm saying hold on to it All right, I'm gonna eat and I'm coming back.
[152:35.40]I Saw it coming, but I had to go all in.
[152:37.56]I'm almost dead He's gonna kill me now.
[152:40.46]I'm stunned All right, can you do this No, I'm just gonna eat meat
[152:53.26]He interrupted my mega potion.
[152:55.22]Rip mega potion.
[152:57.30]He is now taking a little reprieve.
[153:00.30]Or he just is not impressed with my fighting capabilities.
[153:03.78]One or the other.
[153:04.26]Or both.
[153:07.25]He's on the move again.
[153:08.05]Alright.
[153:12.25]I'm coming.
[153:13.79]I wonder if we set up like a pitfall trap for him.
[153:16.43]I'm going to try to lure him into a pitfall trap and see what happens.
[153:21.45]Help is on the way.
[153:22.13]If you can even call it that.
[153:23.77]Here I come.
[153:25.93]He fell in.
[153:27.14]He fell in the pitfall.
[153:27.96]What the fuck are these things telling me to go?
[153:30.52]What?
[153:32.86]What is going on right now?
[153:33.92]What the fuck?
[153:44.23]Down.
[153:48.27]Get up.
[153:48.97]Down and then up.
[153:50.51]Eat the ration.
[153:52.51]Hurry up, my friend.
[153:53.55]I need help.
[153:56.81]I'm always there.
[153:57.69]Hold on.
[153:58.31]I'm always there, sliding around, jumping around.
[154:06.55]Hey, look.
[154:08.13]You find me?
[154:08.83]It's me!
[154:09.17]All right, you take him off.
[154:11.67]You distract him while I heal.
[154:16.07]You get eaten by him while I heal.
[154:19.07]Actually, if you kill the green bug, it heals you too, I think.
[154:21.15]I need to use the... Careful.
[154:24.11]I need a whetstone.
[154:24.91]This is doable.
[154:36.18]Even if we have to die to do it.
[154:48.54]Both getting in there.
[154:49.44]Oh, yeah.
[154:51.45]Ow.
[154:52.19]That was quick.
[154:56.69]I'm scared of his tail.
[154:57.91]Like, so much so that he's... What is it?
[155:01.19]What is that move?
[155:02.19]That's the tail thing.
[155:09.77]No, not at the time to flail.
[155:12.16]There's some poison on the ground.
[155:13.30]There is some poison on the ground.
[155:14.82]So I don't know what that is.
[155:16.60]But don't step in it.
[155:20.90]I don't know if that was him or like a plant, but there was just purple poop on the ground.
[155:24.67]Poison.
[155:27.39]Skunk mode.
[155:29.99]There's some poop on the ground.
[155:31.03]Did he poop?
[155:32.39]Did he?
[155:33.43]I don't know.
[155:34.13]There was definitely like a mud turd on the ground.
[155:36.42]Is that the fabled demon?
[155:37.62]I could have filled like the bar up.
[155:43.58]I wish I had another trap.
[155:44.64]All right, here he is.
[155:49.36]Well, we can use the paralyzing toad.
[155:51.50]I'm going to sacrifice myself.
[155:52.44]Oh lord, dude.
[155:52.94]That is so fucking dumb.
[155:54.74]I just, they always locked on for no reason.
[155:57.83]There's no reason to be locked on there.
[155:59.63]Watch out, tail whip.
[156:01.19]I'm just healing.
[156:05.69]Alright, he's kind of just like letting us hit him and we're not.
[156:08.97]That tail is going to be the end of me, man.
[156:10.41]Here he comes again.
[156:11.30]He's doing the stupid thing again.
[156:12.44]Watch out.
[156:13.80]And he jumps off.
[156:14.80]He does like a fucking frog splash.
[156:16.26]He should kind of do a WWE.
[156:18.02]Just body slam off the top rope.
[156:26.03]He's on the ground.
[156:35.60]Ow!
[156:41.00]There it is.
[156:42.14]That's what I've been trying to do this entire time.
[156:46.74]Excuse me.
[156:53.95]It hurts, but it hurts even worse.
[156:59.83]Stunning.
[157:01.11]No.
[157:02.73]Stunning.
[157:03.81]Did that do anything to him?
[157:07.78]You look like you stunned yourself.
[157:08.82]I just stunned myself.
[157:11.62]Oh yeah, let me take a picture of your fight here.
[157:14.10]All I did is I just aggroed the other enemies.
[157:17.55]That's fucking great.
[157:35.76]Why is he still going for me?
[157:37.80]No, don't.
[157:38.28]I just walked over here.
[157:39.14]Don't do it.
[157:40.08]I just came over here.
[157:41.18]God damn it, man.
[157:42.50]God, give me a fucking break.
[157:44.96]He went for me.
[157:45.55]And he still hit me.
[157:47.05]I'm gonna die.
[157:47.73]I'm just stuck back here.
[157:48.71]Oh, my fucking lord.
[157:51.15]Just at the wrong place every single time.
[157:53.21]I have to always at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[157:54.75]Every time.
[157:55.07]Alright, I'm drinking.
[157:56.87]Alright, he's coming for me.
[158:00.55]Or... I don't know what he's doing right now, actually.
[158:03.64]There he is.
[158:05.75]Ow.
[158:05.95]Okay, dodge roll more.
[158:13.40]I think he went to, like, tier two.
[158:14.96]He looks different now.
[158:15.82]Or is it just me?
[158:19.06]He's, like, lit up like a Christmas tree.
[158:23.22]And I'm almost dead.
[158:28.59]Just to keep me away from you.
[158:29.99]No.
[158:30.31]Yeah, because he keeps going.
[158:31.97]He wastes my mega potions by roaring in the middle of my heal.
[158:35.19]He's running.
[158:36.90]And I'm out of material.
[158:37.76]There's material there.
[158:39.70]Whatever it is.
[158:40.20]I have no more potions.
[158:43.16]Yeah.
[158:46.36]Don't know how close or far we are from actually killing him, but I don't know.
[158:51.11]That's a good question.
[158:52.09]I'm going to do this before I have a second.
[158:54.17]I feel like we're at the 50%.
[158:59.51]Maybe he's charging himself.
[159:01.47]Possibly.
[159:03.75]Possibly.
[159:04.17]Maybe.
[159:04.83]Maybe.
[159:06.66]I have one more potion.
[159:08.94]And then we're both going to have to, like, concede.
[159:12.44]Pretty much.
[159:15.06]Because I think when we die, doesn't it count for each other?
[159:17.36]So if you die once, I die once, and you die once, isn't that three deaths and we lose?
[159:21.08]I believe so.
[159:22.74]Yeah.
[159:25.46]Do monsters have a heal mechanic?
[159:27.03]Some monsters do.
[159:27.99]I don't know if all of them do.
[159:29.05]I think they all do.
[159:33.09]If you leave them alone for too long...
[159:35.72]If they go back to their resting place, then they can heal.
[159:40.04]Yeah, he's definitely doing some other attacks.
[159:42.79]Why did I run all the way up?
[159:46.07]I ran all the way up here with no stamina.
[159:48.57]Right when I came up here, I got hit.
[159:50.31]Don't worry.
[159:52.79]I'm going to die so fast.
[159:56.94]I can't move.
[159:59.16]Watch this tail.
[160:00.08]He's just freaking me out, man.
[160:01.39]I, like, hate.
[160:02.81]I hate.
[160:03.43]I hate.
[160:04.01]I hate.
[160:04.51]I hate.
[160:04.87]I don't know why he walked out.
[160:09.77]Fuck.
[160:11.57]Haha, you died before me.
[160:12.59]Haha.
[160:13.21]I just, like, fucking rolled around.
[160:14.69]I... Game's harder than Dark Souls confirmed.
[160:18.79]Just fucking... Just getting hit by... It doesn't even matter.
[160:23.83]Ugh.
[160:35.07]My turn.
[160:36.67]One hit and I'm dead.
[160:42.27]Can I go this way?
[160:42.95]I don't even know when to attack him, right?
[160:46.68]Don't even... This boss definitely feels more like dodge roll necessary than the other ones.
[160:56.38]I think we need some better stuff.
[160:58.29]That's true, too.
[160:59.59]That is true, too.
[161:02.39]Alright, I gotta take a screencap of this, uh...
[161:04.94]This lovely death screen.
[161:08.55]What am I even looking at here?
[161:09.85]Me, like, walking back?
[161:11.45]This is me, like, in the midst of being dead.
[161:14.25]I look drunk.
[161:15.45]And my guy is wasted right now.
[161:21.33]Close, maybe.
[161:26.87]Well, guys, I don't know if you knew this, but this is only the second time that we've lost in 10 hours of Monster Hunter.
[161:35.71]Kind of, yeah.
[161:36.81]I guess.
[161:37.87]No, no, no, no.
[161:39.13]Not the second time we died.
[161:40.47]The second time we lost.
[161:41.85]Swamp Monster doesn't count.
[161:42.75]He ran away.
[161:43.47]Is that losing?
[161:46.15]Well, we got kicked out of it once.
[161:48.03]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[161:49.15]We didn't lose.
[161:49.93]We got kicked out forcefully by the game, and he left once of his own will.
[161:56.37]We didn't lose.
[161:57.81]We've only lost twice.
[162:00.17]If you don't see the game over screen, it doesn't count as a loss.
[162:05.94]And we really should just... I don't know why we're making this harder for ourselves.
[162:10.36]We need to bring the cats.
[162:13.17]Alright, slow down there.
[162:15.73]Alright, slow down.
[162:16.99]Pump the brakes here.
[162:18.37]Pump the brakes here.
[162:19.43]Listen.
[162:20.49]You want to be the easy mode streamer?
[162:22.53]Or like... You want to be the cat streamer?
[162:25.55]Or do you want to beat the game?
[162:28.68]We do need armor though.
[162:32.82]What can I even do with these?
[162:37.00]Uh, I can't do anything with these.
[162:38.78]Hmm.
[162:43.52]I have a material I haven't found yet somehow.
[162:54.97]What about the bone shooter?
[162:56.57]I feel like this wouldn't be a terrible place with a gun.
[163:06.33]Just to be able to shoot him.
[163:23.22]He's being too prideful.
[163:24.42]Take all the advantages you can get.
[163:37.54]I'm going to use the gun for this.
[163:42.04]And see what I can do with the armor.
[163:49.59]It's always scaled to four players.
[163:52.43]Even if you're playing with two.
[163:53.49]Yeah.
[163:54.67]That also sucks.
[163:56.21]But I'm not going to use that as an excuse.
[164:04.69]Let's go get some armor though.
[164:09.25]Don't use the gun.
[164:10.65]I'm gonna use the gun.
[164:11.45]I want to be able to shoot.
[164:16.65]Gun.
[164:16.95]No, no, not like this.
[164:18.27]Don't use the gun.
[164:19.96]Anything but the fucking gun.
[164:23.84]Do we know how expensive the electric armor is?
[164:27.92]Let's see.
[164:28.36]What monster we need to hunt, actually.
[164:31.68]I'm heading up to the forge.
[164:34.03]It is... Check it out.
[164:37.21]It's the Baroth.
[164:38.27]I think it has lightning.
[164:39.57]Yeah.
[164:40.15]Of course it does.
[164:42.85]Baroth and... Something else does too, I think.
[164:49.73]Looks like Baroth is the best for thunder.
[164:51.93]Are we going to go Baroth hunting?
[164:57.03]We might.
[164:57.51]Bonehelm has two thunder and two dragon.
[165:01.39]Is that guy part dragon at all?
[165:03.55]Ooh.
[165:04.43]He's like a bird.
[165:06.09]Maybe.
[165:10.22]The bone's not too hard.
[165:11.46]It's just monster bones.
[165:13.90]No.
[165:15.52]But is the six defense, though?
[165:17.68]That's not a problem?
[165:19.22]Or are we just gimping ourselves for no reason?
[165:21.10]Yeah, Baroth does have three versus thunder, which is nice.
[165:24.35]I can actually craft the chest piece.
[165:26.25]Yeah, I have the chest on right now.
[165:28.63]Make sure nothing I'm currently wearing is bad versus thunder.
[165:31.23]This one is...
[165:33.09]The Jura is bad.
[165:37.39]So we really want Baroth, I guess.
[165:40.11]Yeah.
[165:40.67]Sucks against fire, water, and ice.
[165:43.43]I'm going to put on mostly fire.
[165:45.77]All right, I guess we're going Baroth hunting.
[165:48.40]Kulu.
[165:49.34]We have a purpose in life.
[165:50.40]Do we have a purpose?
[165:51.10]We're going to kill a Baroth?
[165:52.10]It's to get revenge on the guy that took us an hour and a half yesterday to kill.
[165:55.96]Oh, that man.
[165:57.46]And by the way, as I learned the hard way, blunt weapons are better against him.
[166:02.63]Okay.
[166:03.58]Those sharp weapons, you will be just as frustrated as I was.
[166:08.55]Well, I'm going back to the gun for this.
[166:12.07]What monster type is Baroth?
[166:15.21]Where's the monster book that we've been building up?
[166:20.43]I'm going to pee.
[166:20.95]Let me just pee.
[166:22.00]All right, you do that.
[166:22.62]I'll be right back.
[167:33.06]hey germas chat what you doing there memeing like I don't know you like I don't know oh like loud pee haha so loud I can I can hear it because the youtube video I'm on I like to watch people pee
[168:03.00]My favorite hobby pastime.
[169:13.35]All right, I'm back.
[169:16.84]Probably not going to be streaming for that much longer.
[169:21.38]Maybe we'll do this monster and then attempt the next guy.
[169:26.74]And then I'm going to go.
[169:27.88]Maybe like another 40 minutes or so, I would say.
[169:46.25]uh am I no I'm still muted on here hey how are you hey pretty good just upgrading some armor so I uh am going to be leaving you after the next two monsters okay I'm not sure if that's gonna be probably like another hour maybe
[170:10.99]Alright, yeah.
[170:12.21]I would assume.
[170:12.69]So, like, an hour and nine minutes will be a four-hour stream.
[170:17.53]Something like that, maybe.
[170:19.39]That would be good.
[170:22.27]I'm going to go ahead.
[170:22.95]We have, like, 21 armor spheres, so I'm going to go ahead and use a few of them.
[170:27.20]Yeah, I'm using them, too.
[170:29.32]It's just worth doing, I think.
[170:31.14]I feel like at least a couple of times.
[170:34.14]It only takes, like, three to get to level two or three.
[170:37.78]I know, like, the whole min-maxing argument, like, don't use them, but, like, I have them.
[170:42.27]Like, why not just use them?
[170:44.49]Am I gonna sit on my fucking pile of money?
[170:46.13]Actually takes a lot to get this to, uh... Even just getting it one level up.
[170:54.18]Really?
[170:54.88]All of mine are super easy to get one level up.
[171:01.47]Hmm.
[171:04.56]like bone van masses might suck I'm not doing any to max I'm just just if you buff everything once you actually save right like so imagine every piece of armor upgrading at once gives you plus two yeah or you can upgrade one upgrade one piece of armor four times and pay like twice as many twice as many experience get just as much defense as if you upgraded everything just once yeah yeah it's a good idea
[171:34.83]Okay.
[171:37.13]Let's go to the... What do I want to use?
[171:39.59]A helmet?
[171:40.15]No, I want to use the other helmet.
[171:41.37]This thing.
[171:43.73]Oops.
[171:44.83]Let's put one... That's too many.
[171:48.65]All right.
[171:48.93]I think I'm good to go.
[171:55.63]Ooh.
[172:00.68]Put it on.
[172:05.73]Bone coil, I'm not gonna leave that now.
[172:08.03]They'll be fine.
[172:10.99]Oh Shit nobody can see anything.
[172:13.91]Sorry Whoops Okay, we're good we're good we're good we're good All right, I am ready
[172:33.91]I just need to craft some weapon stuff.
[172:36.97]Actually, I think I already have.
[172:37.85]Yeah, we're going to bring the cats, too.
[172:41.39]There's no reason not to bring the cats.
[172:45.33]Items.
[172:46.35]Let's fill up our ammo.
[172:47.32]All right, I have upgraded everything that I can.
[172:53.36]Spread one, spread two.
[172:55.46]I'm going to pierce some slicing.
[172:59.82]Put that all the way in.
[173:01.06]I just need to make sure that I have...
[173:04.86]Where do I upgrade it from?
[173:06.46]Undermine.
[173:08.02]Okay, let's move some of the skins out of here.
[173:09.92]All right.
[173:14.64]That was really loud for some reason.
[173:18.92]You came in.
[173:19.70]You went into the red.
[173:21.45]I went into the red because I went, uh.
[173:24.05]No, it was that, uh.
[173:25.83]Uh.
[173:26.97]Oh.
[173:27.75]Yeah, you just went red, too.
[173:29.15]Yeah, I know.
[173:29.69]It's like that sharp noise.
[173:30.87]It can't... It's not caught by... I need potions.
[173:33.45]Can you buy... Can you buy potions?
[173:37.51]Why buy them when you can just craft them?
[173:40.04]Well, because I don't think I have enough to make any.
[173:42.76]I need herbs.
[173:43.30]I don't have any herbs.
[173:45.64]Do you have them inside of your chest, though?
[173:47.96]I don't... Maybe.
[173:49.12]Because you should be crafting from your chest, pretty much.
[173:53.13]Like, have you been dumping all your gear from your inventory into your chest?
[173:56.99]Yes.
[174:00.00]I don't think I can make... No, I don't have any herbs.
[174:05.58]No herbs.
[174:07.04]What is this thing?
[174:08.92]Whatever it is.
[174:11.34]I can make energy drinks.
[174:12.98]I need herbs.
[174:18.68]So I'm just going to have to buy them.
[174:20.64]At least temporarily.
[174:21.77]You can't make them from the item box?
[174:23.69]I don't have any herbs.
[174:26.05]You need herbs to make potions.
[174:27.77]Herbs.
[174:28.29]Are you sure they're not herbs?
[174:29.98]They're one of those two things.
[174:34.94]Let's go to... Where is there a person that sells shit here?
[174:45.35]Okay.
[174:46.47]Yes, potions would be nice.
[174:47.69]I thought we were going to have infinite potions just based on how many they were giving out each mission, but... Apparently not.
[174:52.27]I'd be wrong.
[174:53.23]I'd be wrong.
[174:55.66]Because I'm almost out, too.
[174:57.30]What's that down there?
[174:58.06]I've got to go down.
[174:58.60]What the hell is the name of this place?
[175:00.44]The Trade Yard or something?
[175:01.40]Yeah.
[175:02.42]Yeah.
[175:10.04]Provisions.
[175:12.60]Okay.
[175:15.88]No, not here.
[175:16.60]Right here.
[175:17.90]So... Might make some nutrients if you can.
[175:24.06]Do we want to make some traps?
[175:25.82]Am I a fucking idiot?
[175:28.24]Where is it?
[175:28.62]Do you really want to know?
[175:29.74]It's right here.
[175:31.13]Do you really want me to answer that question?
[175:33.93]My brain is just... All of the chat just says yes.
[175:35.93]I'm just off right now.
[175:37.25]My brain is just not here.
[175:41.46]My spirit left my body when we fought that fucking snake monster the second time.
[175:45.40]My spirit left my body.
[175:47.16]Like, literally, my spirit was pulled from my fucking body when we fought that guy the second time.
[175:51.86]I don't even know where it is.
[175:53.41]It's gone.
[175:54.41]It went straight to hell where it belongs.
[176:01.39]I still have ten herbs.
[176:03.93]These are cheap.
[176:05.45]Demon powder.
[176:08.48]Demon drugs boost your attack power by filling you with demonic strength.
[176:12.84]What can I make?
[176:15.38]Okay.
[176:17.20]Sure.
[176:19.02]Down with that.
[176:24.34]I can't make any mega potions at the moment.
[176:25.86]Call for a winged drake to transport you to the nearest camp.
[176:29.42]You can use this during battle.
[176:33.15]All right.
[176:33.61]Let's go kill a Baroth, right?
[176:39.13]Yeah, a Baroth.
[176:43.29]There's cool stuff you can craft.
[176:44.69]So should we do an investigation, or...?
[176:47.79]Should we try to capture one?
[176:50.01]Might as well.
[176:56.21]We haven't, like, captured a monster in a while.
[177:01.26]Let's capture one.
[177:04.64]Sounds good.
[177:07.22]Capture a Baroth.
[177:08.30]This one is 50 minutes.
[177:09.94]Faint one time.
[177:12.18]That's bad.
[177:13.32]So, dying is bad.
[177:15.28]Is there any other ones?
[177:18.91]Too hard for us, apparently.
[177:20.45]This is hunt.
[177:22.35]I bet it eats meat, right?
[177:23.95]This one is hunt Baroth.
[177:28.40]We don't have to have it be specifically captured, do we?
[177:33.50]Um...
[177:34.67]I mean, if we capture a Baroth, do we still get the body parts from the Baroth?
[177:37.92]I guess is the question.
[177:38.78]Don't we get more materials?
[177:39.92]I think so.
[177:41.52]Yeah, I think we do.
[177:42.96]But this one is, if you faint, we lose.
[177:45.86]Yeah, so just we cannot die.
[177:48.52]No.
[177:50.64]I think we're good, you know?
[177:52.62]You want to try it?
[177:53.34]I want to try it.
[177:54.74]I'll give it a go.
[177:55.34]We just need traps first.
[177:59.01]All right, I have it selected.
[178:03.29]What is a bait bug?
[178:04.83]Oh, fishing bait.
[178:06.03]All right, I'm gonna try buying a trap or two, because I don't think I can craft one right now.
[178:10.33]I think I have maybe an option to.
[178:15.93]Drugged meat.
[178:18.93]I guess we can bait traps too.
[178:20.91]Yeah, I've got some sleep meat, and I think what we want to do is get somewhere close, set up a trap, put the shrank meat maybe on the trap.
[178:30.54]Aren't we gonna get shit in the supply box?
[178:34.17]Yeah, we'll get a little bit at least to buff us and help us out.
[178:38.69]But it would still be nice maybe to come with extras so we don't have to leave or quit.
[178:44.44]I'm just going to buy some from this guy.
[178:46.78]Okay.
[178:54.74]Oh, my fucking face.
[178:56.96]Trap tools.
[178:57.46]They're not that expensive.
[178:59.34]I'll get three.
[179:00.08]No, I can get two.
[179:04.40]Meat's only really useful for a specific monster.
[179:07.86]Like a super carnivore or something.
[179:11.32]Yeah, I think we get a bunch of traps and tranquilizers inside the supply box, I think.
[179:15.78]Yeah, but buying a couple traps is like only $400.
[179:18.03]$400?
[179:18.23]Only $400?
[179:19.59]Yeah, it's no big deal.
[179:21.03]Wait a minute.
[179:21.55]If I'm going to use the gun, why don't I make tranq bullets?
[179:24.17]Can I do that?
[179:24.57]I'm pretty sure I can.
[179:34.67]Maybe.
[179:36.07]Trank ammo.
[179:37.43]Well, I need some Trank bombs.
[179:39.32]That would help.
[179:40.66]Let's make some Trank bombs.
[179:43.56]Yeah, I think I have, what, one or two of those.
[179:45.80]Isn't that one of the items that we definitely get in the chest, though?
[179:50.06]Yes.
[179:50.64]Only a few of them, though.
[179:51.44]I think we get eight.
[179:53.26]All right.
[179:53.66]Shock traps it is.
[179:54.92]Boom.
[180:02.09]I can't even make, yeah, I can't make it.
[180:03.67]All right, I'm bringing two extra shock traps with us in case we need them.
[180:09.25]All right, let's just get it over with.
[180:11.33]I can only carry one, apparently.
[180:13.87]I might be able to buy them, too.
[180:16.99]That's true.
[180:17.89]That's true, guys.
[180:19.87]Well, I have an extra one for later.
[180:21.21]All right, I'm ready to go on the mission.
[180:24.92]Good to go.
[180:25.36]Does this guy sell tranq bullets?
[180:28.68]He do.
[180:31.23]Are you going back to the gun?
[180:32.07]I'm just, yeah.
[180:34.30]I am.
[180:36.02]Probably a good idea.
[180:36.68]You did pretty good damage with it before.
[180:38.94]And I think using, like, a sharp blade is probably not the best.
[180:42.12]I think I'm just trying to do, like, trying to go for it.
[180:44.30]Because I played mostly with the gun.
[180:46.06]And, like, I got really frustrated.
[180:48.21]And then, like, oh, no, I'm going to use this weapon.
[180:49.89]And then I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with that weapon.
[180:51.83]No, I'm going to use this weapon.
[180:52.77]And then I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with that.
[180:54.09]It's just kind of a vicious cycle of me not knowing what I'm doing with new items.
[180:59.11]So I might as well just use the thing that I sort of know kind of how to use.
[181:04.69]It's probably a good idea.
[181:06.39]All right.
[181:06.97]Finally figured out how to customize the radial menu.
[181:10.55]Okie doke.
[181:12.27]If you want to put putting traps on there and stuff, it's probably a good idea, like tranq bombs.
[181:18.74]All righty.
[181:19.04]Am I joining you or are you going to join me?
[181:27.02]Either way, we both will have to load, so I'll let you do the quest since you already know where it is and I'll just join it.
[181:32.06]OK, so I'm going to post this new quest.
[181:36.95]Investigations.
[181:39.31]Capture a Baroth in 50 minutes and do not faint more than one time.
[181:46.71]I'm going to the southwest camp.
[181:50.35]And I'm going to use a voucher.
[182:05.98]I am ready.
[182:06.94]Are you ready?
[182:09.85]Oh, yeah.
[182:14.65]Investigation.
[182:15.35]Capture investigation.
[182:16.33]We get a bronze, silver, and gold.
[182:20.93]And I accept.
[182:23.12]Faint one time, and game over.
[182:26.60]You ready?
[182:27.46]So hopefully the upgraded armor is enough to keep us alive.
[182:32.18]Maybe.
[182:33.08]Hope so.
[182:39.99]Oh boy.
[182:41.25]I'm starving.
[182:41.65]This guy sucked.
[182:43.70]I had like a tiny little sandwich.
[182:45.40]I need to eat something today.
[182:47.52]So do you really think the swamp monster's worse than the guy that we're about to go hunt?
[182:52.08]Are you, uh, did you ready up?
[182:53.80]Yeah.
[182:54.24]We, it's currently like loading.
[182:56.43]It says waiting for party members.
[182:57.65]Oh, there we go.
[182:58.53]Yeah, like, because when you stand by, you're already, like, loading into the quest.
[183:04.07]Ah, I see.
[183:04.90]So then when I see the quest, accept it, then I have to, like, manually push ready up to load in separately.
[183:11.88]So you have to wait on me, the lowest common denominator.
[183:15.64]Dang, that stinks.
[183:21.47]All right.
[183:27.10]Begin!
[183:27.56]So I wonder how this Trank ammo works.
[183:35.71]Let's see.
[183:37.93]Bogan ammo used to capture monsters ensnared in traps.
[183:40.77]So when he gets in a trap, I think I can shoot him in the head or something, probably?
[183:46.40]Let's eat a food.
[183:54.09]I'm going to do defense up.
[183:56.67]Oh, you kicked me off.
[183:57.73]We sat down at the same time.
[183:59.43]Oh, definitely.
[184:01.55]Yeah.
[184:02.04]I was inside you.
[184:06.84]Mm-mm-mm.
[184:14.01]All right.
[184:14.39]Defense up.
[184:15.53]No dying.
[184:16.33]Dying is bad.
[184:17.97]Losing is bad.
[184:18.77]Don't die.
[184:19.71]Only win.
[184:20.71]Only winning.
[184:27.38]Winning is the solution.
[184:35.42]Are you ready?
[184:37.92]Let's find this dude.
[184:47.49]And I'm off.
[184:52.81]Let's pick up things randomly.
[184:57.61]Can't go into battle if you're hungry.
[184:58.73]That's true.
[184:59.11]That's true with most things in life.
[185:02.51]You can't do anything if you're hungry.
[185:03.95]Like, for instance, right now.
[185:05.31]I'm hungry.
[185:06.97]In reality.
[185:10.25]It's causing me distress.
[185:13.38]You didn't get extra potions, the traps, any of that stuff.
[185:16.62]Yeah, I know.
[185:17.24]I'm going to be honest.
[185:18.92]I'm real phoned in right now.
[185:23.23]Real phoned in.
[185:24.45]This is like somebody... I'm on the phone with you and my hand is like... I'm real phoned in.
[185:30.76]I told you, my spirit left my fucking body and I'm like, seriously.
[185:34.24]I may as well be asleep.
[185:35.36]Okay, I believe in you.
[185:40.17]Alright, I got stuff.
[185:48.41]No, cats, cats, cats.
[185:50.88]No, we're not bringing cats for this.
[185:52.70]Alright, fine.
[185:53.66]You heard it here.
[185:54.14]No cats.
[185:57.00]We can do this for real.
[186:02.08]No cats.
[186:03.31]Cats are not allowed.
[186:06.15]Yeah, it's the McRib.
[186:07.41]I think it's with the parts that you get from this guy.
[186:14.09]Yeah, it is.
[186:16.23]It is the chest piece.
[186:18.65]So, we're looking... Do we need to, like, track him down, or is he already in?
[186:22.55]Well, there's the... I think we have to at least do something to find him, right?
[186:26.67]Let's see if he auto-appears.
[186:29.53]Yeah, we have to get the scent first.
[186:31.09]We do have to smell him.
[186:36.89]And once we pick up the scent, because that's one of the monsters right there, so... Hey, here's a carcass.
[186:42.27]Check it out.
[186:45.05]Put your hands all over it.
[186:56.52]Sleep herbs.
[187:05.52]Kick the fucking frog.
[187:06.53]He got me.
[187:11.79]Did I actually hit you with that?
[187:12.67]I hit you with that.
[187:14.93]Yeah.
[187:15.29]It kind of just ran straight into the paralysis field.
[187:21.50]All right.
[187:21.76]I'll be with you again shortly.
[187:22.78]I'm going to come down here.
[187:23.70]Just a little dazed.
[187:25.67]No, that's slime sludge, man.
[187:26.97]That's where the swamp monster is.
[187:28.55]Let's go this way.
[187:31.51]Up here.
[187:40.94]Mm-hmm.
[187:52.73]Does anyone not expect the... What do you think about that, Sal?
[187:55.15]Do you think the PC version is getting delayed?
[187:56.47]Do you think it's going to come out this year?
[187:58.75]I think it's hard to delay something that doesn't... Oh, you mean this year.
[188:01.63]Yeah, do you think most of the world is coming out?
[188:03.15]I think it'll come out this year.
[188:04.53]What about like in... I mean, it's January, so they have a lot of time.
[188:10.01]I would expect to see this, honestly, probably in, like, six months.
[188:14.23]I wanted to pick him up.
[188:15.07]He's right here.
[188:15.87]All right.
[188:16.13]Well, hey, easy.
[188:16.93]Hey, look at that.
[188:18.09]Found him.
[188:18.99]Didn't even get to set a trap.
[188:20.21]He just... This is, like, the third time this has happened.
[188:24.75]We're looking for a monster, like, hunting him, and then he just wanders in.
[188:28.92]All right.
[188:29.46]Let's try some traps.
[188:32.26]Mm-hmm.
[188:34.13]You just keep distracting him while I figure out where my trap is.
[188:37.43]Figure out, figure out.
[188:39.15]Where are traps?
[188:39.63]There's a trap down here, away from him.
[188:41.65]So give me a second to put some meat.
[188:45.12]Ooh, I heard.
[188:46.50]Drug meat.
[188:48.18]Okay, put it on the trap, run towards me now.
[188:50.91]Put on your ghillie suit.
[188:52.23]Put on your ghillie suit and run towards me.
[188:53.99]Put on the ghillie suit?
[188:55.51]Yeah, the ghillie suit.
[188:56.41]Where is it?
[188:58.73]I'm currently, he's currently, I'm like fighting him.
[189:00.95]He can like see right through me.
[189:02.57]Look, he doesn't care about you anymore because he smells the drugged meat.
[189:05.25]All right, we got him.
[189:06.49]He's down on the ground.
[189:09.16]He's been shocked.
[189:09.80]He's not on the ground.
[189:12.08]So, should I trank him?
[189:13.60]No, he has to be at least that, like, he has to be limping.
[189:17.18]I don't know.
[189:17.60]I'm pretty confident that there's a way to capture monsters without having to make them super injured first.
[189:22.83]No, no.
[189:23.85]They have to be injured.
[189:24.61]There definitely is.
[189:26.61]I don't think so.
[189:27.55]I saw a video of it today of someone doing it.
[189:30.05]I thought that was, like, a Monster Hunter, like, staple.
[189:33.59]They have to be limping.
[189:34.27]He didn't even drug me.
[189:35.41]He just got shocked.
[189:36.71]So...
[189:41.38]Okay, we have extra shock traps, guys.
[189:43.10]That's why I made an extra one.
[189:45.73]Mr. Cellophane?
[189:46.83]Oh god, I'm in trouble here.
[189:47.85]Apparently not.
[189:49.29]Gotta learn somehow, you know?
[189:50.47]Alright, let him come over here and eat the sleep meat and see what happens.
[189:58.23]I think I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that we have to make him limp.
[190:04.36]That is almost a 100% certainty.
[190:07.13]It's all well and good, but it would be still nice to see what the point of having drug meat in the video game is.
[190:14.91]Does it have to be a point?
[190:16.99]What if it's just for you to have extra fun?
[190:19.75]Well, I can't have extra fun if he never eats it.
[190:22.00]All right, so he's currently running over here.
[190:25.98]Do you smell it?
[190:28.74]Do you look at it?
[190:33.00]No, he's currently the cuckoo man came over here with the egg.
[190:38.22]He only has eyes for you.
[190:40.38]Apparently.
[190:41.22]Put on your ghillie suit.
[190:47.21]All right, ghillie suit on.
[190:49.33]I'm now invisible.
[190:52.19]I no longer exist.
[190:55.02]Plus this guy's doing our job for us anyway.
[190:57.86]I'm not hiding.
[190:58.36]He's going to eat your meat.
[191:02.01]Or just run up the hill.
[191:05.13]What, did that guy just teleport?
[191:07.79]Uh, no, he was over there.
[191:13.06]Alright, well.
[191:16.52]Drug meat confirmed does nothing.
[191:19.68]I think it just makes it so you can get him on the ground and start to smash his head or something.
[191:26.03]He won't eat the meat until he is hungry.
[191:29.87]This is very realistic.
[191:30.43]You gotta wait for the hunger meters.
[191:32.95]That's a pretty realistic game.
[191:34.67]It's like we're in the survival game.
[191:37.77]Except they're the ones trying to survive.
[191:41.67]Punks.
[191:43.45]Round two.
[191:46.88]When does he get hungry?
[191:48.82]He's a giant monster.
[191:49.62]You think one little piece of meat wouldn't be that bad.
[191:54.44]Well, now he can see me again.
[191:58.33]Barath only eats insects.
[192:01.47]That'd be so funny.
[192:02.94]He definitely smelled it the first time and then ran into the shock trap.
[192:11.84]Alright.
[192:12.28]This guy's getting swarmed by birds.
[192:15.16]I give up.
[192:16.11]Alright, let's kill him.
[192:16.83]Let's capture him.
[192:19.74]One of the birds is eating the drug meat.
[192:22.94]The bird's doing the drugs.
[192:25.70]Hey, well, he gets meat, man.
[192:28.63]Somebody's going to eat it.
[192:30.09]Have we even gotten any skins from these small monsters yet, honestly?
[192:33.61]I don't know.
[192:35.57]I think maybe one or twice.
[192:37.01]Once or twice.
[192:38.02]One of them fell asleep.
[192:39.14]Right now, the other one's freaking out like, holy shit, wait a minute.
[192:43.86]I think that meat may have been tainted.
[192:46.18]Wait, I ate some, too.
[192:47.20]Okay, that's the equivalent of, you know, like, you both, you go to, like, a restaurant, and you both eat, like, you both eat different meals, but, like, I had a bite of your sandwich, and your sandwich was the one that made you sick, and I'm just like, wait a minute, I had a bite of that.
[192:58.93]Am I gonna be alright?
[192:59.77]I might get sick, too.
[193:01.19]No, I'm not gonna get sick.
[193:01.87]I only had, like, two bites of his sandwich.
[193:05.15]Alright, um, I'm about to shoot him in the ass.
[193:08.46]Go ahead.
[193:09.08]Oh, he's already, he's out of range.
[193:14.12]Because you're supposed to put the meat on the traps to trap them.
[193:21.43]But once the drug meat puts them to sleep, it just... I threw something at him.
[193:26.63]Why are we going to fight him here?
[193:28.13]I like the incline.
[193:29.91]It's like the worst possible place.
[193:31.74]He can tail whip us off the ledge.
[193:35.04]Yeah, that's pretty dumb.
[193:37.28]He's just screaming in my ear.
[193:38.56]He's screaming in my ear.
[193:47.18]That's making me laugh.
[193:49.40]He yelled like too loud in my earphones.
[193:57.24]This is slicing him.
[193:58.10]I don't think this is going to do very much to him.
[194:00.06]I'm going to put on spread.
[194:04.52]Let's load it.
[194:08.32]Hmm.
[194:18.04]tail squid.
[194:21.12]What are you doing?
[194:22.68]What am I doing?
[194:23.38]No, no, no, not me.
[194:24.58]Oh.
[194:25.02]What?
[194:25.40]Load it!
[194:25.82]What the fuck?
[194:27.28]Probably should have remembered my combos in training before picking this weapon.
[194:33.04]Now that I've been doing switch acts all day, kinda don't remember what this weapon does.
[194:39.23]Ha!
[194:39.97]Nice sniper.
[194:41.23]Nice sniper.
[194:41.77]Right up the tail.
[194:43.37]Right in his ass.
[194:46.87]You do have to kind of get him, like, in his butthole, huh?
[194:50.17]Yeah, easy.
[194:58.54]Ow.
[194:58.66]Alright, that was a real delayed hit there.
[195:02.76]Seems like you broke apart.
[195:06.72]Drink.
[195:08.00]Alright, somebody in the chat just be like, triangle, triangle, circle, triangle plus circle, dodge.
[195:13.18]Alright, just write the combo and I'll do it.
[195:15.60]I'm gonna shoot a bong on Adam.
[195:19.29]So I'm gonna wait until he comes over here again.
[195:20.57]Maybe I won't.
[195:26.95]Yes, I will.
[195:27.77]Yes, I will.
[195:29.41]How did I let him hit me?
[195:32.53]How did I let that happen?
[195:34.42]You gotta be kidding me.
[195:41.23]Oh, that's probably gonna, that's probably gonna make you move around.
[195:44.53]Ow.
[195:45.25]Yeah, it had a small effect on me.
[195:47.05]No!
[195:47.37]I thought he was gonna come for me!
[195:50.07]Alright, come on little bug.
[195:59.10]Work your magic.
[195:59.84]God damn it.
[196:00.46]I keep treating it like it's Dark Souls and it's so dumb.
[196:03.56]Boy, you have iframes when you dodge?
[196:05.21]I keep, like, waiting for it, like, dodge, no!
[196:07.31]So I'm gonna, no, there's no iframes.
[196:10.53]No, don't!
[196:14.83]Oh my god.
[196:15.63]It's okay, one death, no fainting.
[196:29.98]We got it under control.
[196:35.65]Uh...
[197:07.71]So, all right, cool.
[197:12.60]Yeah, this is a very challenging video game.
[197:21.30]I feel like it was terrible to have this here.
[197:23.63]And I keep switching between weapons, but like, honestly, I don't think we have enough players for one of us to use ranged.
[197:31.47]I really believe that.
[197:33.47]maybe that might be that might be like what the bow is used for you know because it has more dashing and dodging and stuff I don't know and the isn't the small lighter gun like more boring but it's you can yeah I don't want to use that thing maybe the bow I'll try the bow maybe
[198:09.54]Two players plus two cats is four.
[198:13.68]All right, we can try with cats, but we lost the mission, so... Now we're just in no man's land.
[198:19.25]Well, we could queue up again from the quest, giver.
[198:24.19]Or... Not?
[198:26.84]I don't know.
[198:32.34]Why does it say this is not an option?
[198:37.59]The bow sucks, too.
[198:38.17]Are we still on a quest?
[198:39.85]I don't know.
[198:40.15]Are we still on it?
[198:41.19]Did it restart it or something?
[198:42.51]I don't see any quests, but it says this is not available right now when I talk to the lady.
[198:52.98]I'm just going to go with these for now.
[199:00.14]Bow is great.
[199:01.00]Bow is awesome.
[199:01.86]It's not upgraded, though.
[199:03.99]That's true, but for basic upgrades, it only takes some monster bones.
[199:08.93]Yeah, but I'm saying we're not bad.
[199:11.09]I don't want to leave.
[199:12.15]Can we just queue it up again here?
[199:15.01]I tried that, but it said you cannot do this right now.
[199:18.88]So maybe you can?
[199:19.66]Were you the party leader?
[199:21.86]You have an X next to your name.
[199:24.26]Let's see if I can do it.
[199:27.02]Post a new quest.
[199:28.30]Oh, does that just mean voice chat's off?
[199:31.14]Can I just post this again?
[199:35.15]try if you want I mean I guess then you post it first I'm technically like in your game I think so it says I mean I'm just doing it again okay so now what happens so now I'll go to her I said can you just accept that here I'll put the hammer back on for this
[199:57.06]You sure?
[199:58.26]You will get more health that way.
[199:59.94]Well, I mean, I'm just... I have, like, sword.
[200:01.92]I'm using, like, a sword against the... Isn't Blunt better against this dude?
[200:05.98]I think so.
[200:14.11]All right.
[200:14.53]I'm standing by.
[200:15.75]We have to depart from here.
[200:19.19]So, wait, we have to... I think it has to, like, bond the creature where it's supposed to be and make sure that we're...
[200:28.17]It's like, because we were just in the expedition, like, free roam mode, so this is probably just making sure that that monster is, like, here.
[200:36.61]Okay, I see.
[200:39.85]It's creating a separate lobby.
[200:42.48]Let me just put this shit on.
[200:44.34]And also, since we're starting the quest, it also refills the supply box with stuff.
[200:48.54]That's good.
[200:53.62]That's a good thing.
[200:54.90]I'll take the shock trap.
[200:57.73]frank's eat some food get your health up all that jazz defense up confirmed that online difficulty for two players is the same as playing with four players why probably just a multiplayer difficulty and a solo difficulty I guess
[201:28.90]I guess.
[201:33.90]It's kind of like in Dark Souls, you know?
[201:35.90]When you multiplayer queue up, does the boss get harder for every single person that joins you?
[201:43.34]No, I don't think so.
[201:44.76]I think it does.
[201:46.52]I don't think it scales with like two or four people.
[201:48.85]Did I just take everything?
[201:50.39]No, I left stuff.
[201:52.25]So you take anything that's in there.
[201:54.09]Oh, okay.
[201:56.26]All right.
[201:58.10]I'm ready.
[201:59.25]Did you take a ration?
[202:03.03]I did.
[202:04.19]Watch.
[202:05.07]I'll prove it to you, Dad.
[202:06.15]I'll prove it to you, Dad.
[202:07.65]Did you take your vitamins today, son?
[202:09.19]I'm about to take my mega nutrients, Mom.
[202:13.63]We gotta make sure we're ready.
[202:14.97]So we're not taking the cats.
[202:16.31]This is the last opportunity we're gonna have to take the cats.
[202:18.97]You can veto override.
[202:20.53]Do you want to take the cats?
[202:21.45]We're gonna do this without cats.
[202:22.89]And if we don't do it without cats, then I'm going to put my hand through my computer and the stream is gonna end.
[202:34.76]I keep hearing the PS4 and I keep thinking it's me.
[202:38.52]Oh, okay, so apparently the multiplayer trade-off is, since the difficulty is the same, no matter if you're playing with two or four, the cats are just pretend people.
[202:49.28]Alright, we're doing the, get, we'll get the cat, I ain't fucking getting angry again.
[202:52.45]Get, let's get the cats.
[202:54.01]Bring the cats.
[202:55.85]Okay, we're bringing the cats.
[202:56.81]We're bringing the cats.
[202:57.93]I, I, I don't care about my pride.
[202:59.95]You think I give a shit about my pride right now?
[203:02.47]No, I want to just play the game.
[203:04.19]We're playing with the fucking minus two people.
[203:06.32]I didn't,
[203:08.23]Bring the cats if you want to.
[203:09.32]No, I don't even care anymore.
[203:10.88]I don't care what anybody says.
[203:11.74]All right, bring in my palico with me who has no armor for some reason.
[203:19.26]Even though I bought some earlier.
[203:21.22]Now knowing that, having that information, that multiplayer is designed for four people, and it's as if you're playing with four people, then bring the goddamn cats, all right?
[203:30.53]We haven't been playing with the cats almost the whole game.
[203:33.61]True, we have not.
[203:38.66]We need some little helpers to, like, toss us heals and grab aggro.
[203:42.58]Are you sure you don't want to switch back to the gun now that we have cats?
[203:47.11]No, it's too late.
[203:48.55]Too late.
[203:48.99]That ship has sailed.
[203:49.83]That ship has sailed.
[203:50.57]I'm using the hammer.
[203:54.35]Which way do you want to go?
[203:58.69]I don't know.
[203:59.49]We just ran into him in this ravine last time, didn't we?
[204:06.10]I think so.
[204:12.81]Maybe.
[204:15.05]I'm searching this way.
[204:15.87]You search that way.
[204:18.03]Just practicing a couple moves.
[204:19.45]All right.
[204:21.65]Showing off my skills.
[204:27.90]Any people down here?
[204:29.38]There's a random pig.
[204:32.66]Kind of absentmindedly following you, actually.
[204:39.50]Okay, I'll split up and go this way.
[204:45.41]Looks like there's something here.
[204:47.07]Rocky Balboa wants your attention.
[204:50.31]Hey, he does.
[204:51.35]The only people that will judge you for using the cats actually don't play the game.
[205:01.82]Well, that's a cuckoo.
[205:04.74]That's probably true.
[205:12.18]Alright, I got a trail for somebody.
[205:15.00]No, this is not like the bear.
[205:16.42]This is like... This will be the second or third time we've killed the bear off.
[205:19.00]But we're doing the thing.
[205:19.98]Yeah, so it won't be the second time.
[205:21.62]We only killed it once.
[205:22.68]But this is the... It took like an hour.
[205:25.75]This is the we're not allowed to lose once bear off.
[205:29.87]Correct.
[205:33.01]All right.
[205:33.29]I got the scent and he is this way.
[205:35.81]He's down here.
[205:44.30]You'd buy this game just for the underwear shots.
[205:48.26]That's assuming that you have the small kilt on that I have.
[205:55.77]Okay, he's here.
[205:56.83]He just kind of jumped down, huh?
[206:02.08]I think he, like, waits to ambush you in this path.
[206:04.76]All right, we going in?
[206:06.14]I think we're going in.
[206:09.82]All right, so it has begun.
[206:13.08]It has begun.
[206:14.56]With a roar.
[206:16.68]Good way to start.
[206:22.11]Where are you going?
[206:29.33]Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo.
[206:32.47]Well, see you later.
[206:35.62]Nice snipe.
[206:38.66]He's going down here.
[206:39.54]No, he's going to... This same thing just happened.
[206:43.18]This guy came up the same way.
[206:45.64]This is just Groundhog Day.
[206:48.43]We just keep living the same nightmare.
[206:50.05]I don't want to even attract this guy.
[206:57.23]I'm going to accidentally hit this dude and it's going to be terrible.
[207:03.68]Yeah, uh...
[207:05.62]At least he's not as dangerous as the guy that he's fighting right now.
[207:09.20]So, we got that.
[207:10.50]At least.
[207:10.88]I think my bug just broke apart on him.
[207:14.52]Watch it.
[207:15.16]No, don't be there.
[207:18.08]Oh, god damn it.
[207:20.13]Don't even tell me that just happened.
[207:21.19]What, the mud?
[207:23.83]No, the, uh... I think I just accidentally hit the... Cocoa Puffs bird.
[207:31.15]Did I?
[207:41.44]Get up.
[207:46.18]I knocked his head off.
[207:46.96]I broke his head.
[207:48.72]Come on.
[207:56.24]What?
[207:57.14]What just exploded?
[208:00.45]Don't land in the mud.
[208:05.19]Roar.
[208:06.31]Why does it keep putting my weapon up?
[208:10.08]There he goes.
[208:18.06]He's moving on out.
[208:21.99]Follow.
[208:27.19]I need to sharpen my blade.
[208:28.97]Don't let him get too far.
[208:43.36]He is waiting for us in the valley.
[208:48.88]Get him!
[208:51.69]Did he retreat because we did a bunch of damage, or...?
[208:55.01]Maybe.
[208:55.87]Why did he go straight for me?
[208:57.69]I'm the one who attacked him, too.
[208:59.91]I know.
[209:00.17]Alright, breaking parts.
[209:16.54]Oh, come on.
[209:23.19]What is happening?
[209:23.77]There it is.
[209:29.87]Out of stamina.
[209:31.69]Is he running away again?
[209:33.13]He was trying to buck me off, I think, because I jumped on top of him.
[209:39.06]Ah, shit.
[209:39.66]I wasn't prepared for that.
[209:58.77]Bash bash bash Over here ocean.
[210:11.74]All right, no room for error.
[210:15.64]Oh
[210:19.79]I need to heal.
[210:25.12]Oh, that's not what I wanted.
[210:27.94]He's attacking Rocky Balboa.
[210:29.48]We have a good distraction here.
[210:30.62]Oh shit, Rocky Balboa even just healed me.
[210:32.34]What a dummy.
[210:35.83]He's currently floating and my scythe is like bouncing off of his foot.
[210:43.37]In the head.
[210:44.19]In the head.
[210:45.49]In the head.
[210:56.33]Score power.
[210:59.62]That's not safe.
[211:10.78]In the fucking head.
[211:12.64]I have to use whetstone.
[211:34.86]How's he doing?
[211:47.51]I'm figuring this out.
[211:48.25]I need to get Whetstone real quick.
[211:50.53]He's coming for me immediately.
[211:54.80]Don't forget to sharpen your blade.
[212:03.81]No, no, no, no.
[212:04.57]Stay over here.
[212:10.25]Ah, damn it.
[212:11.33]At least I hit him once.
[212:17.34]Come on.
[212:17.82]Stop roaring and let me at him.
[212:21.42]Is he running?
[212:21.96]I think we got him down a little bit more.
[212:24.22]Yeah, I think so.
[212:24.68]All right.
[212:25.24]This is going much smoother this time.
[212:36.52]Capture.
[212:39.40]Hey.
[212:40.40]Hey, you.
[212:43.79]Not yet.
[213:00.37]Alright, back on his head again?
[213:10.90]Yep.
[213:15.41]He is just running around.
[213:18.71]And he rammed his... Oh!
[213:20.11]What?
[213:20.95]What happened?
[213:22.09]What did I just do?
[213:22.96]That was amazing, whatever happened there.
[213:25.76]I, uh... He bucked me off by ramming into a wall.
[213:29.34]I flew off, but as I flew off, I pushed triangle, and I lassoed back onto him.
[213:34.54]I couldn't hit him right in the head.
[213:37.96]Well, you actually can lasso back on.
[213:39.50]Yeah, if you, like, if you get bucked off and you still have stamina, you can use your, um...
[213:44.25]your little, like, rope Spider-Man thing.
[213:47.83]All right.
[213:48.51]He might be in pain here.
[213:49.81]That was amazing.
[213:52.68]All right.
[213:53.20]I need to come up and help.
[213:57.58]He's in pain.
[213:58.50]I'm hitting his stupid foot.
[214:00.84]Oh, my.
[214:01.24]Yeah.
[214:01.74]This is a weird spot.
[214:02.91]All right.
[214:06.83]I need to sharpen again.
[214:09.63]Is he hurt?
[214:10.11]Is he ready?
[214:13.83]My whetstone is inex... Oh, there it is.
[214:16.44]Is... I can't tell.
[214:17.52]I don't think he is.
[214:19.00]I don't know.
[214:20.64]Do you have a trap and I have a trap, both?
[214:22.10]I mean, I have a trap, yeah.
[214:26.42]Doesn't look like he's ready.
[214:29.20]Nope.
[214:30.26]He is very unready.
[214:40.10]Shit.
[214:41.70]Watch out, there's the roar.
[214:43.50]Now he's running.
[214:44.10]He's still not limping.
[214:45.56]Still not ready.
[214:46.18]I need to use my whetstone here.
[214:51.99]Yeah, the lasso, the whatever you want to call it, pretty sick.
[214:56.89]So you see what the variable here is?
[215:00.79]The variable is... We have the cats this time.
[215:04.51]Well, we do have the cats, but you also aren't considering that switching to a melee weapon inherently gives you more defense and life.
[215:12.06]This is true.
[215:12.44]Ranged weapons have less hit points.
[215:14.52]But I have not been hit even remotely as many times as I was before.
[215:18.32]I mean, that's definitely just a fact that he's attacking probably each of us equally.
[215:28.39]Equal.
[215:29.27]But I don't think he's as tough... I don't think his attack patterns are as difficult as... No.
[215:36.72]...the swamp guy.
[215:38.08]No, no way.
[215:41.08]Or especially the electricity guy.
[215:46.28]I mean, the most annoying part about this guy is he has like hard parts that you can't, you're not allowed to hit.
[215:53.60]Unless you have a blunt.
[215:56.82]This is true.
[216:04.23]I love that my little insect on my insect glade.
[216:06.73]Oh, there we go.
[216:08.13]He's hobbling now.
[216:08.83]He's hobbling.
[216:09.35]Now we can do it.
[216:12.02]Insect glaive, I can set it to do different elemental status effects.
[216:15.48]So I have my insect set to heal me.
[216:17.81]So if I send out the insect, I can call it back and it gives me a heal.
[216:22.45]Fun weapon.
[216:23.53]That's cool.
[216:25.47]Is he just going to sit right here?
[216:27.23]I guess.
[216:27.75]We can trap him pretty much anywhere.
[216:31.03]Now he's in here.
[216:33.39]Can't trap on any of this terrain.
[216:37.70]I can set it here.
[216:38.44]So, we'll just walk him into it.
[216:40.14]I put the trap down here.
[216:40.94]Alright, I'm coming back.
[216:42.62]See if we can drag him over there.
[216:46.12]Hello.
[216:48.81]This way.
[216:51.03]Mr. Monster.
[216:51.65]Over here.
[216:59.07]And... So close.
[217:00.63]It's time to... Hey!
[217:04.00]Now!
[217:08.49]We actually completed something.
[217:10.93]We actually did it.
[217:12.73]Look at that.
[217:14.07]How?
[217:14.77]How?
[217:15.74]Wow.
[217:16.88]Wow.
[217:17.38]And we captured it?
[217:18.54]And you can't even die once?
[217:20.64]Whoa.
[217:21.02]All right.
[217:23.56]We can't loot them.
[217:24.26]We just get more stuff, right?
[217:25.76]That's why it only gives us 10 seconds.
[217:27.66]Oh, hey, swamp monster.
[217:29.15]I wanted to come over here just to make sure he saw me leave.
[217:33.73]Of your own free will and volition.
[217:35.37]Yep.
[217:35.97]He can try whatever he wants.
[217:40.25]All right.
[217:41.27]Nice.
[217:44.35]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[217:45.87]What's the reward?
[217:46.61]Baroth Ridge, Baroth Tail, Baroth Claw.
[217:49.87]Just a lot of Baroth parts, but I got some Fertile Mud.
[217:54.25]All right, so now let's make some more.
[217:56.63]Let's make some gear.
[217:58.75]And a Baroth Tail.
[218:06.30]I gotta, like, shake off this anger.
[218:07.88]I may as well keep, like, Emperor Palpatine.
[218:10.97]I was cyst-seething in this chair, like, 40 minutes ago.
[218:13.67]If there was a webcam... Oh, if I had my webcam on, I would have been purple.
[218:33.62]I was just sitting here just like... I'm so glad there's no webcam.
[218:40.27]This is why I don't use a webcam, guys.
[218:45.91]I'm just sitting here just like... And the boogers are coming out of my nose and shit.
[218:50.86]Yeah, that's why I don't use a webcam either, you know?
[218:54.92]Yeah, you have a webcam on.
[218:56.48]You're not allowed to see that I am.
[219:00.54]There is no seething.
[219:01.44]You have no seethe shade here.
[219:04.12]You can't pull the shade down.
[219:06.04]See, I could just be like... You can't pull the shade.
[219:08.40]No, you have the open window and you're just sitting there watching TV naked.
[219:13.53]Anybody can just look in your house.
[219:14.87]My shades are down.
[219:20.53]So, do we need to go all the way back home?
[219:22.25]I think so.
[219:23.25]Let's go craft and then try to fight Mr. Electricity Man.
[219:30.31]All right, so we're going to give one more attempt on the electricity squirt.
[219:33.96]And look, I don't know, maybe I start to... Maybe my rage goes away and we kill this guy and I can play again.
[219:42.64]You're assuming a lot about killing this guy.
[219:44.48]I know.
[219:45.28]Considering the way the last fight went with him.
[219:47.58]I know, but look, now I'm relaxed.
[219:50.86]Though we didn't have cats when we fought him the last time.
[219:53.35]We didn't have cats.
[219:54.07]I wasn't relaxed.
[219:57.27]I didn't have my afternoon tea.
[220:00.33]I was being a baby.
[220:01.53]I've still got some cold coffee.
[220:07.48]I don't have any more coffee.
[220:09.18]Thanks for that nice reminder.
[220:10.98]Now I'm upset again.
[220:12.94]Did you not get any?
[220:14.22]No, I'm kidding.
[220:16.71]I don't believe you.
[220:18.09]That's good, because I would like.
[220:20.59]Alright, let's go make some more steakums armor.
[220:25.15]Get your armor spheres.
[220:26.85]Go get some more steakums.
[220:30.31]Oh, we just did large monster capture.
[220:31.93]I wish I had done that register.
[220:35.23]Okay.
[220:44.46]Okay.
[220:46.58]Okay.
[220:48.14]Okay.
[220:48.66]So I think, um, uh, forge armor.

[221:26.39]Which one did I upgrade?
[221:29.91]Alright, Lightning Resistance.
[221:32.17]That would be great.
[221:38.84]Oi!
[221:41.44]Put it on.
[221:41.92]And I believe that's good to go.
[221:53.97]God Joe God Joe is it better than I have on?
[221:57.82]Okay, I do anything with the hammer No, I cannot Okay, I'm gonna keep the hammer I

[222:36.20]I have seven shells.
[222:39.82]Yeah.
[222:42.45]Make the barrow off hammer?
[222:43.47]I don't think I can.
[222:46.67]Does that exist?
[222:50.89]Hold on.
[222:56.63]Tree.
[222:58.89]Iron Hammer.
[223:00.39]Aqua Hammer.
[223:02.55]Blooming Hammer.
[223:04.76]Bone.
[223:08.24]Kulu.
[223:09.92]Carapace.
[223:10.46]I don't know if I can see it.
[223:13.78]I don't know if I can do it right now.
[223:14.98]All right.
[223:26.12]While Italics is gone, let's do some bits.
[223:31.68]Thank you to HighlordNameless for the 50 cents.
[223:34.04]Big wow, thank you.
[223:36.31]I skipped over it.
[223:37.27]Oh, I'm stupid.
[223:38.07]Sawdust Bunnies, thanks for the two bucks.
[223:39.51]Bring the cats.
[223:41.13]Cats are always going to come.
[223:44.63]He was right there.
[223:45.45]Oh, I'm like looking at chat and shit.
[223:55.85]I gotta clone myself three times.
[223:57.99]One person to look at chat, one person to read the bits, and one person to play the game.
[224:02.03]And the two can whisper in my ear, and one of them can just talk too.
[224:05.70]I need four people.
[224:06.84]I need one person to play the game, one person to talk, one person to read the chat, and one person to read the bits.
[224:10.70]All me.
[224:11.62]But I separate my consciousness into four places.
[224:18.09]I'm such a fucking scatterbrained moron.
[224:20.13]That's the only way it's possible.
[224:21.65]Alright, let's see.
[224:29.71]This one down here.
[224:30.35]Okay, so I need two Baroth Ridge.
[224:34.71]All right, upgrading the new gear now.
[224:36.39]I need a bone.
[224:37.09]How much damage does it do?
[224:41.21]I got the helm.
[224:41.89]Two Ridges.
[224:45.11]And they are much more expensive.
[224:48.33]Well, if we kill another Baroth, then I can probably do it.
[224:54.00]Next level takes five parts.
[224:56.60]All right, let's go kill this.
[224:58.22]Let's go kill this monster.
[225:11.33]I believe I have enough stuff here.
[225:18.57]No, I don't want to need that shit.
[225:24.13]So, win or lose here, I'm going to be ending my stream.
[225:29.66]We have to give it a good, solid attempt here, Italics.
[225:32.76]Oh, he can't hear me.
[225:33.96]Don't forget to make some cat gear, since we're using the cats now.
[225:36.84]Yes.
[225:37.97]We have to do one good, solid attempt.
[225:39.93]Because win or lose, I'm going to be leaving for the evening.
[225:44.36]Okay.
[225:45.82]Is there a pallet?
[225:46.54]Oh, of course they also use... Yeah, these are the same stuff.
[225:49.94]We can... Okay.
[225:51.62]But did they take a claw?
[225:53.64]I only have one claw.
[225:55.65]Alright.
[225:56.41]Do I give it to the cat?
[225:58.61]I'm going to make my cat good stuff.
[226:00.77]Alright, fine.
[226:01.71]We're going to just make him the good stuff.
[226:03.67]Might as well.
[226:05.20]If we're just giving it one attempt, we may as well make it count.
[226:07.76]Make it count.
[226:08.62]It's like having to make gear for a second player who's just taking your gear.
[226:15.25]That's alright.
[226:18.37]I just don't want to give him my only claw.
[226:20.87]Doesn't he already have his own claws that he can use?
[226:23.39]Well, the weapon I don't think is that important.
[226:26.47]I don't know.
[226:26.81]This weapon looks pretty important.
[226:28.04]It's like a big spiked mace.
[226:30.30]Alright, I'm doing it.
[226:31.28]This weapon is capable of smashing boulders into gravel, so it says.
[226:36.39]All right.
[226:37.37]I got my guy decked out.
[226:39.57]The actual Baroth mace gives him plus five defense.
[226:43.99]He just loses 20% crit.
[226:47.34]Nice.
[226:49.28]And also the armor is resistant to thunder.
[226:53.08]It is very good.
[226:55.36]This is just a father-son Halloween costume.
[226:58.04]That's all this is.
[226:59.96]Yeah, it kind of is.
[227:05.01]Except I'm not wearing any pants.
[227:06.23]What's going on with the Jupiters here?
[227:08.07]Why did I make my cat so ugly?
[227:11.58]It fell in a bucket of paint.
[227:13.16]It's like a regular old white fur cat, and I spilled purple and orange and blue paint on it.
[227:26.81]So I need... I'm really hurting when it comes to potions here.
[227:33.77]Although I think they're going to give you a few.
[227:35.45]Yeah, we'll get stuff in there.
[227:37.33]They give you like eight or ten.
[227:39.31]All right.
[227:39.59]I have forged all of my Falico's equipment.
[227:47.96]Nutrients.
[227:52.00]Can I not make a mega potion?
[227:55.94]Potion and honey, right?
[227:58.10]What the heck, man?
[227:59.46]Don't I have those?
[228:03.72]Mega Nutrients.
[228:06.11]Yeah, I'll do a Mega Nutrients.
[228:08.39]Alright, question.
[228:09.27]If our weapon does Water Elemental, is that bad against Electric-type Pokemon?
[228:14.21]I think it's good.
[228:16.17]It seems like it'd be bad.
[228:18.46]Isn't Water weak against Electric in Pokemon?
[228:22.96]Maybe.
[228:23.96]Wouldn't Rock be better?
[228:26.68]Rock versus Lightning.
[228:28.50]Rock versus Lightning wins, doesn't it?
[228:30.83]Does it?
[228:31.11]I don't know.
[228:32.35]I never played Pokemon.
[228:33.88]Apparently it's good.
[228:36.08]Water is good against electricity?
[228:38.70]I guess.
[228:39.58]It doesn't make any sense.
[228:42.55]I don't know.
[228:42.97]Is it?
[228:43.31]We need to just use science.
[228:48.11]Blame Capcom for not making any sense.
[228:51.95]Ground.
[228:56.31]We're about to fight an electric Pokemon.
[228:59.39]Not the other way around.
[229:01.74]Water conducts electricity.
[229:03.33]It's just normal damage.
[229:07.79]Oh, I can't really do anything else.
[229:10.77]I can make another bone hammer.
[229:15.82]Nobody knows.
[229:16.68]It's not Pokemon rules.
[229:20.30]Electricity damages water more, but water damages electricity normally, apparently.
[229:25.10]In this video game.
[229:25.80]It's like there's no reason to have it over a normal weapon.
[229:29.86]Uh, there's no reason to not have it either.
[229:32.82]It does normal damage.
[229:33.80]Yeah, so there's no reason to not have it either.
[229:40.89]Item pouch.
[229:43.19]Hopefully there's a lot of potions in that fridge.
[229:48.47]Alright, you ready to do this?
[229:49.85]Ready to give this a try?
[229:53.83]Uh, one sec.
[229:55.75]What do I have here?
[229:57.11]This, like, cell is useless.
[230:01.37]What a needleberry.
[230:02.43]For some reason, they made this game where I think he's weak against water.
[230:05.89]Okay.
[230:07.09]Counterintuitive.
[230:08.09]That is the opposite, but that's fine.
[230:09.81]It should be like rock-type weapons are good against this guy.
[230:13.51]They should redo the whole series until they do it my way.
[230:16.37]Redo the whole game.
[230:19.21]All right.
[230:19.43]You got to do it my way.
[230:21.49]Let's give this a solid try.
[230:24.43]What do you say?
[230:26.03]I am ready and waiting.
[230:28.81]Do you want me to start it, or do you want to start it?
[230:32.16]Uh, I'll start.
[230:33.14]I'm gonna upgrade the helmet once.
[230:37.04]Just because.
[230:37.66]So I can be totally prepared.
[230:41.47]We're ready.
[230:51.89]Alright, is it up?
[231:00.53]Join a quest.
[231:02.62]It is indeed up.
[231:03.66]Assigned.
[231:05.27]Kill... Where are you going?
[231:06.51]Northeast or southwest?
[231:08.53]Southwest.
[231:09.87]Okay.
[231:11.01]Let's do it.
[231:16.08]Let's get a good win here.
[231:18.44]What do you say?
[231:19.45]I think we're... I think we stand... We're upgraded, right?
[231:23.12]We did what you're supposed to do.
[231:24.24]We got a little bit of Thunder Resist Armor.
[231:26.46]We got our cats in Thunder Resist Armor with upgraded weapons.
[231:30.20]We're bringing cats.
[231:31.16]Like, what else is there, you know?
[231:32.88]If we can't win now, then we may as well take the game to GameStop and give it to someone more worthy.
[231:40.61]What's your favorite monster?
[231:43.99]Mine's Pukey.
[231:47.65]Pukey Pukey is my favorite.
[231:51.19]All right, I'm ready.
[231:52.63]I'm ready to do this.
[231:53.63]I'm ready to get a win before the stream ends.
[231:59.66]How bad can I get in one stream?
[232:02.18]I think we've already experienced that critical mass.
[232:04.78]No, the critical mass was like two hours ago.
[232:09.30]So it was like the three stages of anger.
[232:13.02]It was... And denial.
[232:15.22]No, disbelief.
[232:17.03]Yeah, denial's first.
[232:18.37]Well, no, I wouldn't say disbelief is denied.
[232:21.41]We're matching now, so that's a plus.
[232:23.61]Yeah.
[232:26.11]The five stages of grief.
[232:27.68]Disbelief.
[232:29.94]Disbelief.
[232:31.02]Rage.
[232:33.58]Exhaustion.
[232:36.00]And then rest.
[232:38.51]And now I'm back to where I am, back to normal.
[232:41.25]The five stages of grief, right?
[232:43.35]What did I just say?
[232:44.97]It was initial rage.
[232:48.10]Departure from reality.
[232:49.22]Soul removed.
[232:52.02]Disbelief.
[232:53.02]Disbelief.
[232:53.70]Rage.
[232:54.14]Exhaustion.
[232:54.93]Rest.
[232:55.41]There it is.
[232:55.87]Same one.
[232:56.35]There you go.
[232:58.11]Just saying the same one.
[232:58.93]Yes.
[232:59.21]It's disbelief.
[233:00.23]Disbelief two.
[233:02.53]Rage.
[233:03.09]Exhaustion.
[233:03.99]Rest.
[233:04.83]Normalcy.
[233:06.13]That's how it works.
[233:08.87]All right.
[233:09.09]I'm eating an elemental resist up meal.
[233:11.67]Have you taken everything you need from here?
[233:14.03]I took everything I needed from there yeah I'm taking they gave us poison knives and they also gave us uh uh blight cure so I think that was what gets rid of the thunderstruck you know like the acdc is you cure it you cure acdc with all right take particular your mega nutrients I don't have any I've taken my mega nutrients I'm gonna eat my ration
[233:40.65]All right.
[233:41.19]Are you ready to... No, we gotta eat.
[233:43.15]Eat.
[233:43.89]Eat.
[233:44.17]Hold on.
[233:46.01]I already ate.
[233:46.65]I already did that part.
[233:47.41]I'm gonna also make some meat.
[233:50.30]I'm gonna take elemental resistance up.
[233:52.68]Bingo.
[234:04.34]Wait, what happened to my helmet?
[234:08.90]Where's my helmet gone?
[234:12.75]Eating food takes my helmet off, all right.
[234:17.69]We already have him on the screen.
[234:19.75]The game is just laughing at us.
[234:22.69]What are you talking about?
[234:23.55]He's already up there, he's already tracked.
[234:27.33]Okay, yeah, because we've already gotten the information.
[234:29.41]All right, so the reward for this is I get to eat food.
[234:32.39]That's the reward.
[234:33.66]All right, just got a well done steak, I'm gonna eat that.
[234:35.86]You can't eat with a helmet on?
[234:37.04]Yes, you can.
[234:37.52]You just like lift up, you pull, you lift up the chin part and you put the food in.
[234:42.80]You never should take off your... You never should break character.
[234:45.18]I think that was for stamina.
[234:46.20]Alright.
[234:46.86]Good to go.
[234:47.60]Don't ever break character.
[234:52.49]Looking a little mish-mashed right now, but that's okay.
[234:57.35]Needleberry.
[235:00.18]Down here.
[235:02.56]Take this mining outcrop.
[235:10.52]Me too.
[235:12.06]And get your eyes on the prize.
[235:14.35]Because it's about to get hairy.
[235:17.91]It is about to get serious.
[235:19.29]The good news is we have twice as much firepower as we did before.
[235:22.91]And we have kit it out.
[235:26.45]We have gear.
[235:27.85]We aggroed something.
[235:30.63]It's just these dumb idiots.
[235:31.65]We aggroed.
[235:33.04]And there is also another.
[235:34.32]That's a monster I do not want to fight.
[235:36.12]Oh my god.
[235:38.95]Did he see you?
[235:40.47]Can he see you?
[235:40.89]No, he's coming for me.
[235:44.17]He's coming after me.
[235:45.01]I don't know.
[235:46.47]If he sees me, he's not... Now he sees me.
[235:49.10]Okay.
[235:49.90]I'm away.
[235:50.40]I'm going to put on the ghillie suit.
[235:52.44]Oh, yeah.
[235:52.68]We have a ghillie suit.
[235:56.54]I think that makes it able to walk by him.
[235:58.18]All right.
[236:05.74]Okay.
[236:05.98]Uh, Gelly?
[236:06.98]Uh, I'm getting away.
[236:08.12]He doesn't know where I am anymore.
[236:09.36]Okay, uh, Gelly?
[236:11.12]He wants your McRibs.
[236:16.50]I think I can walk right by this guy, uh, Gelly?
[236:22.17]Yes, I can.
[236:23.05]Alright.
[236:23.77]Now, just hope this guy doesn't follow us in our fuckin' Gellys.
[236:27.41]Up here.
[236:27.83]Uh... Alright, I'm gonna try to run past.
[236:30.99]Alright, run past, Gelly.
[236:36.60]All right.
[236:37.66]So now... I'm going to remove it so it doesn't burn all your... The ghillie has to, like, recharge.
[236:43.63]Yes.
[236:45.23]I also have a smoke bomb.
[236:46.91]What are my serious thoughts on this game so far without, like, any joking around or any, like, exhaustion?
[236:53.45]Thoughts on the game so far?
[236:54.21]I think it's great.
[236:55.33]Oh, you're asking him?
[236:56.43]I mean, I just... I think it's great.
[236:59.04]I do have a massive problem.
[237:02.48]A massive problem with the way the multiplayer is in the game.
[237:06.88]But, okay, let's say I think the video game, the game Monster Hunter World is fucking awesome.
[237:12.28]It's probably like a 9.4 out of 10.
[237:14.74]It's, this is great.
[237:16.94]And it's up!
[237:18.90]That, this, the multiplayer system brings it down to a 7.
[237:23.51]Overall brings it down to a 7?
[237:24.65]No, I'm just kidding.
[237:25.47]I'm just trying to get everybody to get to the same stages of grief that I'm on.
[237:31.30]Derma gives Monster Hunter a 7 out of 10.
[237:33.68]No, I'm just... You're at the bottom of the review list so that everyone clicks on your review and you get all the ad clicks.
[237:40.00]Yeah, I know how this works, all right?
[237:41.52]No, we're going the wrong way.
[237:42.68]We have to go the other way.
[237:43.82]Polygon is going to have some words to say with you.
[237:46.12]I'm just trying to get everybody to grieve with me.
[237:47.81]You want to be the lowest on the list every single time, okay?
[237:50.63]Where are you?
[237:52.39]I don't know.
[237:53.53]I'm following the birds.
[237:54.61]I mean, I'm following the flies.
[237:55.89]I'm following these flies.
[237:58.71]Yeah, you got to come back here.
[238:02.36]No.
[238:03.12]I would give this game overall... Overall, I would give this game probably like a 9, I would say.
[238:08.60]Overall.
[238:09.86]It's like a straight up 90.
[238:10.82]It's very, very good.
[238:14.08]Can't use the Gilly Mantle, but it's okay.
[238:15.57]He's not aggressive.
[238:16.23]All right.
[238:16.61]Are you ready to make him aggressive?
[238:18.79]He may become aggressive in a second.
[238:20.99]Really?
[238:22.21]Gilly?
[238:23.07]He's kind of just like looking at me.
[238:24.65]All right.
[238:26.13]Is he... He might not be hostile initially.
[238:28.61]I didn't bring any Mega Potions.
[238:29.92]This is not going to go well.
[238:31.06]Mega...
[238:32.03]All right, ready?
[238:33.51]As ready as we will ever be.
[238:35.09]Three, two, one.
[238:43.99]As ready as we'll ever be.
[238:45.63]Did you pick up poison knives?
[238:47.03]I did not.
[238:49.96]Did not pick up any poison.
[238:53.90]Watch that fucking tail.
[238:58.64]Ooh, I did hit him.
[239:01.95]All right, I don't know if this is actually doing anything, but I'm shooting him with the poison.
[239:08.10]Seems like it's doing steady taking damage.
[239:09.92]It looks like it's doing like 10 damage.
[239:12.06]Yeah, not bad.
[239:12.94]That's not bad, yeah.
[239:15.72]Probably doesn't last very long, though, if I had to guess.
[239:24.53]All right, easy, easy.
[239:27.79]Careful, watch out for the tail whip.
[239:29.25]Yep.
[239:34.62]Watch out for his electricity EC.
[239:38.52]Really?
[239:39.14]Okay.
[239:40.20]I was above that for sure.
[239:45.91]Hey!
[239:47.15]Why did you heal me right when I pushed potion?
[239:49.65]Cat's stupid, confirmed.
[239:52.15]Ah, I was trying to get him right in the head.
[240:00.13]There he goes.
[240:01.27]He's on the move.
[240:03.64]I'm gonna laugh so hard.
[240:04.54]It's like, what if we finish this quest and you know how you get like the, who did the most damage?
[240:09.08]And it's one of the cats.
[240:10.85]Who's like on the card instead of us.
[240:14.13]Oh, one of the cats did it.
[240:22.43]Hello.
[240:26.59]One of the goddamn cats.
[240:33.56]He can knock you out of the sky with a roar too?
[240:35.52]He's not even mad.
[240:37.58]That's kind of amazing.
[240:44.58]Oh, that hurt.
[240:47.47]Oh, that hurt.
[240:50.99]Oh, the tip of that just got me, Odell.
[240:54.31]Where even... I hit him in the head.
[240:59.37]That's not cool.
[241:01.86]Where is he?
[241:03.78]Oh no, Italics has fainted.
[241:06.38]Yeah, you know why I fainted?
[241:07.84]What happened?
[241:09.95]I'm just going to complain.
[241:12.95]I got hit with a tail whip.
[241:14.17]I got hit with another off-the-top rope tail whip.
[241:16.49]And then while my character was stunned, as soon as he became unstunned, he attacked me a third time in a row.
[241:23.31]I'm going to just try to avoid.
[241:26.42]He's running away, so it's alright.
[241:28.76]Nothing bad happened from it.
[241:30.82]He's just running away.
[241:38.21]I just got like stuck.
[241:39.76]What do you do?
[241:40.48]Yeah, that's uh, go down except he stuck me Why am I like why am I using like the hookshot for?
[241:46.66]All right, he's we're good Restore the power
[242:09.35]And... What the fuck?
[242:12.89]Holy shit.
[242:14.13]Okay.
[242:14.75]There we go.
[242:21.19]I just did like a sonic move.
[242:23.27]I just turned into Sonic the Hedgehog.
[242:26.63]I got a nice mount attack in.
[242:30.77]There we go.
[242:46.17]Run a little low on stamina.
[242:47.85]Make sure you sharpen.
[242:48.61]Don't forget to whetstone.
[242:50.98]That is a good call.
[242:53.54]Good call.
[242:54.24]He's doing the flying squirrel on Rocky Balboa right now.
[242:57.22]Might lose for the first time ever.
[243:00.90]No, no, no, no, no.
[243:01.90]I'm not ready.
[243:03.02]See?
[243:03.54]That's all you can say.
[243:04.80]You need new timeouts in this game.
[243:06.72]You can say, hey, timeout.
[243:14.82]Right in the head.
[243:18.57]Come on.
[243:20.69]That one was on.
[243:25.93]Kill me.
[243:34.00]Oh, what?
[243:35.52]How dare you?
[243:38.16]Come back to me, bug.
[243:39.56]Where'd he go?
[243:40.70]He's running back here.
[243:41.60]Oh, he's running away?
[243:43.09]Put it away, put it away, put the sword, put it away.
[243:46.19]What do you do?
[243:50.69]What do you do, man?
[243:51.65]What do you do?
[243:52.15]I just ate a ration.
[243:55.87]Why did I do that?
[243:57.13]I can't tell you.
[243:58.27]Thank you for reminding me, though, because since I died, I believe my easy bake oven ration wore off because I don't have as much stamina as I had before.
[244:05.38]So, good call.
[244:07.78]Good ring-a-ding-ding.
[244:15.63]Every time I go for this, it's really annoying.
[244:18.63]It's all right.
[244:19.32]He's useless.
[244:20.68]Ooh.
[244:24.80]He's actually helping us.
[244:29.00]He is actually helping us, yeah.
[244:31.16]No, I stand corrected.
[244:34.01]Is he hurting you now?
[244:35.07]Yes.
[244:39.29]Mm-hmm.
[244:47.26]There we go, there we go.
[244:50.76]Really, three hits like that doesn't knock him out.
[244:58.62]There we go.
[245:02.87]Ow.
[245:04.63]Hi, coming in, coming through, ow.
[245:07.39]Yeah, we're in a bad spot together.
[245:08.35]I just landed like right where you were swinging.
[245:16.05]Oh boy, come to you.
[245:19.48]I'm feeling pretty good about this.
[245:24.84]Oh, God damn it.
[245:25.38]I didn't mean to use that, apparently.
[245:35.49]Look at his legs.
[245:36.83]All right, nobody's going to expect this.
[245:39.65]Smoke bomb.
[245:40.68]What does that even do?
[245:43.80]I'm going to laugh so hard if it actually makes him unable to see us.
[245:50.56]and no you're not gonna you're not gonna keep stop moving come on you move around too much okay we're good I don't want to die again
[246:20.25]Drink the potion.
[246:21.96]Yeah, I would love to drink too.
[246:23.00]I think he's running.
[246:23.70]Alright, time to whetstone.
[246:27.26]Yes.
[246:31.50]And then chase.
[246:35.68]Come on, monster.
[246:36.40]Stop moving and just let me hurt you.
[246:43.49]Nobody has a health bar in the game, except for us.
[246:45.96]The monsters, you just have to kind of guess to see how they are.
[246:48.47]Unless there is, like, an ability.
[246:49.97]There might be some kind of, like, tracking shot eventually that lets you see their health.
[246:53.87]Who knows?
[246:54.55]Maybe.
[246:56.37]Maybe.
[246:56.71]Maybe.
[246:57.05]Maybe.
[247:01.65]Antidote.
[247:08.47]Mm-hmm.
[247:18.78]There we go.
[247:19.20]That's what I wanted.
[247:19.78]Right in his head.
[247:21.78]Ow.
[247:22.22]Something broke.
[247:26.94]All right.
[247:27.28]We're going for a ride.
[247:33.11]He doesn't like it.
[247:35.09]But I don't care.
[247:35.69]I'm doing crazy damage right now.
[247:40.47]I'm just riding him.
[247:42.10]I'm distracting him pretty hardcore, actually.
[247:45.22]He's trying to buck me off.
[247:47.06]So you should be getting like a lot of free hits.
[247:48.76]Kind of, not really.
[247:52.98]Kind of, not really.
[247:54.90]I need to use wets.
[247:55.64]He's tired.
[247:57.97]He's glowing purple.
[247:58.97]I just knocked him out.
[248:04.71]Come on.
[248:05.03]Give me a baseball swing here.
[248:06.55]Baseball swing.
[248:07.21]Come on.
[248:09.19]Oh, I did it.
[248:10.09]Finally.
[248:13.05]Am I standing in the purple goop?
[248:14.35]I might be.
[248:15.51]He's very hurt.
[248:16.81]I am purple.
[248:21.40]He's very, very hurt.
[248:25.94]I was.
[248:26.36]Where's he off to?
[248:32.66]Oh, that way.
[248:33.49]Over to me.
[248:45.30]Ow, my bones.
[248:50.00]What?
[248:50.24]That was a nice interception there.
[248:55.40]Annoying.
[248:58.62]He's limping.
[249:00.74]After him.
[249:08.35]I think we got this.
[249:11.01]If we can just get through the swamp zone.
[249:12.99]No, no swamp.
[249:19.38]Shot him with poison just to be mean.
[249:21.72]Just be a dick about it.
[249:22.80]Uh-oh.
[249:29.40]There might be a problem over here.
[249:31.50]With the Ghillah monster that he's hiding behind?
[249:33.72]He's trying to trick us into attacking the Ghillah instead.
[249:40.05]Did I just hit him in the face?
[249:42.29]I think I hit him in the face on the way down.
[249:45.59]I hit him with the backswing.
[249:47.65]There's so many monsters right here.
[249:55.00]pretty much out of the way dude yeah it's just the wrong time right when we're on the cusp he's running I mean we could capture him but do we do we have to kill him it's hunter toby kadachi I don't think we have any traps do you still have an easy fake oven
[250:24.28]No.
[250:24.44]Because if not, we're not gonna be able to capture them.
[250:26.20]I do not.
[250:27.46]So, I guess that's the answer.
[250:30.90]So, let's just murder them.
[250:32.98]Okay.
[250:34.11]Kind of the only option at this point, I think.
[250:38.11]It's almost as if they needed the cats the whole time.
[250:40.27]Yeah, I guess so.
[250:43.23]Hey, but we beat the other monsters without the cat.
[250:45.83]Oh, shit.
[250:46.81]I don't know.
[250:47.13]I think it's more satisfying without the cats, personally.
[250:50.28]Maybe, but... Maybe if we had two people playing with us.
[250:53.02]Or the... Yeah.
[250:56.56]He is just sleeping.
[250:57.30]Come on, right into the baseball swing.
[251:01.68]Aww.
[251:02.62]Ha!
[251:06.66]Watch out!
[251:07.10]Top ropes!
[251:14.29]That was a big tail whip.
[251:15.09]I'm actually about to die again.
[251:17.74]Yeah, what a great party member.
[251:23.81]Yeah, what a great party member.
[251:25.19]Good support class here.
[251:26.39]I didn't even have to use a potion.
[251:30.53]Alright, here we go.
[251:31.29]Baseball him.
[251:32.13]Baseball swing in his head.
[251:34.01]Come on.
[251:35.03]Baseball swing.
[251:36.29]Do it.
[251:37.64]I wanted to grudge his head.
[251:39.66]Alright, make sure to get the materials.
[251:44.82]Hey, nice.
[251:52.45]No, not the piercing pod.
[251:53.93]Well, that was... This is just bullying.
[251:58.29]Don't bully the poor squirrel monster.
[252:01.86]A melee weapon.
[252:04.88]Listen, we're gonna wear it, okay?
[252:06.38]This is for clothing.
[252:08.72]This is... Don't you know it's okay to kill endangered animals for clothing?
[252:14.42]The vicious cycle of the chat.
[252:16.50]What do you mean?
[252:19.64]What, now everyone... Is everyone yelling at us not to use cats?
[252:22.90]No, no, no.
[252:23.56]Everyone's... Everyone was... Dude, the whole time, everyone was yelling at us to use the cats.
[252:27.64]They were like, put the cats on, guys.
[252:30.12]No, no.
[252:31.24]Oh.
[252:32.98]They were trying... They were telling us to use the cats.
[252:35.44]And we were like, yeah, man, we're fucking the best.
[252:38.91]We are the best.
[252:39.85]And then I lost my mind.
[252:41.79]Yeah.
[252:42.63]It's okay.
[252:43.33]It's okay.
[252:43.85]We got it, you know, mission complete.
[252:45.61]We can fight this monster as many times as we want now.
[252:48.35]Yes.
[252:51.62]like that was a one-time deal where you could never find that guy again electrolytes oh you got to level eight oh yeah you got five slinger shots the canteen has been upgraded what are you healing
[253:19.67]Uh, myself, and also my bug on my insect glaive heals me.
[253:26.47]Oh, okay.
[253:29.43]Slinger sniper.
[253:30.66]I shot it with five poison knives.
[253:33.94]Apparently that constitutes a sniper of great skill and magnitude.
[253:38.46]Alright, I think that's gonna do it for me.
[253:41.72]Yeah, I mean, that's a good note to end on, you know?
[253:45.45]Story quest completed.
[253:49.51]We did take two hours to fight the slime monster.
[253:54.19]It's all right.
[253:55.07]But just pretend like you didn't see that part of the stream.
[253:58.29]The moral of the story is every monster we tried to kill today, we did.
[254:02.91]That's true.
[254:03.57]Come see me.
[254:03.99]We've got an urgent quest.
[254:07.03]That is true.
[254:07.57]You're right.
[254:09.59]We didn't have to give up and go home on any single monster.
[254:12.75]And at the end of the day, isn't that what counts?
[254:15.76]I almost unplugged my computer from the wall.
[254:20.93]And I was gonna be like a little bit of the power outage others a power outage fucking crazy Sorry guys screams over.
[254:27.39]Oh wow like Comcast right again like you just use the crutch.
[254:31.62]What the heck?
[254:32.22]Yeah, you guys see those drop frames.
[254:34.18]I'm getting some interference here.
[254:35.44]Yeah, I guess three thousand frames Wow, it's lagging like crazy now man yellow bar like what I upload is of 1.5.
[254:43.27]Are you serious not again?
[254:44.71]Oh?
[254:48.41]Wow.
[254:48.85]I'm going to have to call the support.
[254:51.35]I'm going to have to get a support guy out here.
[254:54.01]All right.
[254:55.37]Well, as always, Italics, it's always a pleasure.
[254:58.40]Yeah, it was fun.
[254:59.44]I think this game's great.
[255:00.64]This is a solid 9 out of 10 with, like, 6 out of 10 online multiplayer.
[255:06.12]You know, it's like a 9.7 out of 10 video game and, like, a 7.1 online multiplayer, like, party system.
[255:15.23]Yeah, the way that I choose to look at it, even though it's not true at all, is pretend this game is a single-player game, and we're actually playing with, like, a downloaded mod that enables multiplayer.
[255:26.37]A mod.
[255:26.99]Yeah, because if this was just a single-player game, it would, you know, I wouldn't change anything, really, except for some menus.
[255:36.58]Yeah, no, it's great.
[255:37.94]Highly recommend it.
[255:40.40]If you want to play it, get it.
[255:42.48]It's great.
[255:45.14]You just have to get over the multiplayer funkiness.
[255:50.21]Yeah, it's not even that big of a deal.
[255:53.51]It's just frustrating.
[255:54.75]The only thing that is actually a big deal is it's stupid that you have to watch the cutscene separately and then load back in.
[256:02.18]Everything else, multiplayer works.
[256:04.08]Why can't it just show us both the cutscene?
[256:07.46]Is that that hard to code into the game?
[256:09.41]Yeah.
[256:10.09]I guess I don't know did they just did they make the whole game and then some guy was like wait a minute do we have a way to show both players oh no we don't ah it's all right just put it in a menu somewhere yeah but everything else besides besides that objectively bad thing yeah pretty good like starting co-op missions optional missions is pretty easy you don't have to if you had to be at the gathering spot
[256:39.30]That would be annoying.
[256:40.18]But the fact that you can do it from anywhere is pretty good.
[256:43.34]I still don't know how to join an expedition in multiplayer without first doing an investigation.
[256:49.80]I'm of the opinion where if it's not very clear exactly how to play multiplayer with somebody.
[256:59.94]Because right now, how long have we played for?
[257:02.03]Like 10 hours?
[257:03.51]Yeah, we played about 10 hours on stream.
[257:05.47]If we still are having trouble, how do you join an expedition?
[257:07.87]I feel like that's a problem.
[257:09.25]And we troubleshooted it for, like, three hours before yesterday's stream.
[257:12.77]So we're going on almost 15 hours.
[257:14.93]Right.
[257:15.49]Of multiplayer gameplay.
[257:17.03]But that's the only complaint that I have of the game.
[257:19.55]And it's unclear how to start an expedition with another player.
[257:23.70]Yeah.
[257:24.38]And even if it is clear somewhere, that's the only complaint.
[257:29.34]I know because I looked up a multiplayer how to play with your friend guide, and they didn't really know how to play an expedition.
[257:37.14]Yeah.
[257:39.26]I think that was like Eurogamer.
[257:42.36]Eurogamer.
[257:44.00]No, it wasn't.
[257:44.58]I don't know who it was.
[257:45.34]But anyway.
[257:46.70]All right.
[257:47.76]Take it easy.
[257:48.36]Italics is chat.
[257:49.24]Italics is stream.
[257:50.16]We'll see you later.
[257:51.30]It was fun, guys.
[257:52.56]And see you all next time.
[257:55.16]All right.
[257:55.40]What's the funniest thing you can think of saying that would be funny getting cut off?
[258:04.09]What do you think?
[258:06.21]If I don't... All right.
[258:08.83]He's gone.
[258:10.58]Alright, that's going to wrap up Monster Hunter.
[258:14.62]I feel like I'm having a lot of fun in the game.
[258:18.66]It's super frustrating, super fun, and it's a big learning curve, but, you know, you get to see it all on stream.
[258:26.73]For the future of this game, you're not going to see this game probably again.
[258:30.97]Unless, like I said, maybe I'll do, like, maybe once on the weekend.
[258:35.85]Hey, this is my progress so far.
[258:37.25]Here, let's go kill a monster together or something.
[258:40.57]This is not something you can expect to see on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday stream.
[258:51.55]It's great for chat, Jupiters.
[258:55.06]Maybe this coming Saturday, we'll do it again.
[258:59.76]No, we're not doing Monster Hunter tomorrow.
[259:02.54]Like I said, hopefully Tuesday is Light Gun.
[259:04.78]I'm hoping I can get that set up.
[259:06.64]Light Gun streams.
[259:11.99]And with that, let's get to the bits.
[259:14.17]Thank you for watching, everybody, this little unplanned, just Saturday off-schedule stream.
[259:23.76]We're going to move over to here.
[259:28.46]And let's read some bits that I missed from earlier.
[259:32.70]Thank you to uh-uh-uh.
[259:38.47]Let's go back to here.
[259:46.06]I sure didn't miss it.
[259:48.00]Alright, SirOfficialPotato, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[259:52.84]Hey German, your stream is entertaining as always.
[259:54.97]I know it's something which every other streamer is doing at the moment, but do you think you could try streaming Subnautica one day?
[260:02.41]It's perfectly fine if you don't feel for it.
[260:05.07]Good luck with your monster hunting.
[260:06.51]Thank you, SirOfficialPotato.
[260:09.16]I've actually gotten quite a few people to ask me to play Subnautica, so I feel like I kind of should play it.
[260:15.30]It's not on the immediate cards, but maybe I could throw a couple streams in at some point over the next couple weeks.
[260:24.73]Thank you for the 10 bucks, though.
[260:27.69]Why is everyone suddenly interested in Subnautica again?
[260:30.95]I thought the same thing, because it was kind of a thing everyone was playing like a couple years ago.
[260:35.25]And what, did it get like an official release?
[260:38.25]I remember, like, years ago, people were, like, making Subnautica videos.
[260:44.73]If it's worth playing, I'll check it out.
[260:47.41]Thank you, Clickbait Bros, for the five bucks.
[260:49.33]Don't get upsetty.
[260:50.29]Have some spaghetti.
[260:54.33]Oh, I was so angry earlier.
[260:55.59]I mean, you guys probably know this by now.
[261:01.59]But there's, like, a formula here.
[261:04.10]Forget about, like, the jokey grief formula I was giving you.
[261:08.19]But when you're, like, trying to, like, learn something new, and you're super frustrated, and you're trying to figure out exactly how to play a game, and you know that people are watching you do it, and then you make, like, mistakes, and it's very bad mistakes, and the game has to, like, we have to, like, start over.
[261:26.18]It's just, like, it's so, it, like, it's just, like, god damn it.
[261:29.93]Because you guys are watching that happen.
[261:32.40]It would be different if, like, my fucking grandfather was here and he was watching me play Monster Hunter and I got run over by the T-Rex and died.
[261:39.94]He would have known.
[261:40.54]He wouldn't even care.
[261:41.96]He'd be like, oh, whoopsie-daisy, did you see that T-Rex, son?
[261:45.52]And I'd be like, yeah, it was crazy.
[261:48.12]He wouldn't even know.
[261:49.56]He would think it was funny.
[261:50.38]He would think it was cool.
[261:52.84]He'd be like, oh, I don't even know what I'm looking at right now, but I just saw a monster on the screen.
[261:56.60]Good job, son.
[261:58.24]And internally, I would know it was a terrible mistake and he would have no idea.
[262:05.14]So, sorry if I'm frustrated for like a, it was like a good like 45 minute portion of the stream that I was just really fucking angry at.
[262:17.51]Isn't your grandpa in hell?
[262:24.71]Uh, yes.
[262:26.11]Grandpa is in hell, you're right.
[262:30.31]What?
[262:31.27]Um, thank you.
[262:34.13]Thank you for even sticking around and watching.
[262:37.17]Just imagine we're the grandpa.
[262:40.95]People expect you to get frustrated.
[262:42.19]Well, there's a difference between getting frustrated and then actually being seething here, angry.
[262:47.23]I can't even... No, I didn't get to a point where I was that angry, but... I think every time I got to a point where I was going to get really mad, something else happened that I could laugh at and it kind of threw water on the fire.
[263:03.87]It's still a raging fire, but somebody threw water at my chest and, like, it put out the chest fire.
[263:15.00]But, thank you to Smokewise Ganja for the five bucks.
[263:17.58]Stop hammer time.
[263:20.00]Camel, thanks for the two bucks.
[263:21.76]I just do a German Jupiter.
[263:22.80]Reptilian God, thanks for the five dollars.
[263:26.66]Hey, German, I found this guy's credit card.
[263:28.16]Here's some money of his.
[263:30.36]I don't do that.
[263:32.59]Do not do that.
[263:33.43]That is, I do not condone that.
[263:35.77]Please don't do that.
[263:37.55]Oh, no, no, you're referring to the guy that, okay, that was a joke from the guy from earlier.
[263:44.98]Swiggity swanky, thanks for the five bucks.
[263:47.64]Chat, don't look down on Jeremy when he tries to look up to us.
[263:53.40]Oh, he's making a short person joke.
[263:57.88]Did I do a funny haha meme earlier?
[264:00.26]I probably did.
[264:00.80]I wouldn't be surprised.
[264:01.94]I used to watch baseball all the time.
[264:03.82]But not really anymore.
[264:06.58]Sports have taken a backseat to everything else.
[264:27.46]The Patriots are all right, I guess.
[264:29.12]They're gonna be in the Super Bowl.
[264:30.92]Be cool.
[264:31.34]And they're gonna win, like, two Super Bowls back-to-back.
[264:35.14]What about those deflated footballs?
[264:38.28]You know, here's the one thing that I think is, like, it gets me going about, like, the Patriots.
[264:41.44]I don't really care that much.
[264:43.02]But, like, remember the whole deflate gate thing?
[264:44.64]Like, Tom Brady's, like, under, like, doing deflating footballs and shit.
[264:48.14]And everybody was like, that's why he's so good!
[264:51.38]It's because he's been cheating for 12 years!
[264:54.93]And then they won two Super Bowls.
[264:56.75]Like, they won a Super Bowl and they're gonna win this one back to fucking back.
[265:01.13]Like, I mean, what now?
[265:03.49]When he was apparently cheating, he apparently wasn't winning that well.
[265:06.05]And now, apparently, when they figured it out... What happened there?
[265:14.52]Deflated balls, inflated egos.
[265:19.64]Fuck the Patriots.
[265:24.06]He found a different way to deflate them.
[265:31.71]Yeah, so now what he does is he hands the ball over to Gronkowski before every play.
[265:36.19]And Gronkowski, like, puts his mouth up to the thing where you put the, uh... You put the needle in to deflate, and he just, like... He just sucks in, like, a full lung capacity full of air and hands it back.
[265:48.24]It's like a flea flicker.
[265:52.86]But thank you.
[265:54.60]Thank you, Pebbles, for the $1.
[265:55.89]Jerma, you're a nerd.
[265:57.87]I think most of us here would classify as that, so... Get him, boys!
[266:03.63]Thank you, Grizzly1620, for the $1.
[266:05.13]I've actually been in a bit of a low spot in life lately.
[266:08.61]But you've been helping me feel a lot better.
[266:09.87]I never want you to forget the amount of joy you bring us.
[266:14.11]P.S.
[266:14.35]I don't actually blame you for the nugget advice.
[266:16.47]It was only a joke.
[266:17.19]I blame myself for getting McDonald's in the first place.
[266:21.26]Grizzly, thank you first of all for your contributions.
[266:26.30]Second of all, McDonald's, we've had the McDonald's conversation.
[266:31.67]You know, I want to make my own chicken nuggets.
[266:33.83]How do you even make chicken nuggets?
[266:37.31]There's no chicken nuggets recipe online.
[266:41.01]How do I make chicken nuggets?
[266:42.75]Who makes them?
[266:43.51]You buy them?
[266:44.37]Hold on.
[266:47.20]You can't even make chicken nuggets at home.
[266:50.08]That's not possible.
[266:51.62]I've never had somebody make me homemade chicken nuggets.
[266:57.76]Chicken... nuggets... recipe.
[267:05.54]No, but you can't like just cut it up.
[267:06.78]Get a chicken and cut it up and then deep fry it?
[267:16.90]Chicken nuggets.
[267:24.03]Apparently it takes 25 minutes to make these.
[267:29.89]You get a meat separator and then run the chicken assholes through it.
[267:35.71]Yeah, that's actually... Alright, this is one cup of flour, one tablespoon of salt, salt and freshly ground black pepper, two large eggs, two breadcrumbs, two chicken breasts, and cut them into small pieces.
[267:52.13]In a plastic bag, stuff your head in it, close around your neck, and breathe in until you pass out.
[267:57.81]What?
[267:58.87]That's not how you make chicken nuggets, is it?
[268:02.44]Mix the flour, seasoned salt, and some salt and pepper.
[268:05.18]Why is it saying that?
[268:07.66]In a plastic bag, mix the flour, seasoned salt, and some salt and pepper.
[268:14.56]In a bowl, mix the eggs with two tablespoons of water in a separate bowl.
[268:17.82]Shake the chicken pieces to...
[268:20.27]No, that's gross.
[268:21.33]Somebody else had it right.
[268:22.19]You have a meat grinder and you put in like the eyeballs.
[268:27.22]Nobody makes homemade chicken fucking nuggets.
[268:37.36]Thank you, but grizzly.
[268:40.52]Hopefully you start feeling better.
[268:46.01]It's not easy to come out of a low place, but just take it slow every day, man.
[268:52.64]Thank you for even being part of this community.
[268:58.21]Much respect.
[268:59.53]Much love, of course.
[269:03.51]I wish you the best of luck, man.
[269:07.09]And Haven Music, thank you for $1.
[269:09.95]Hey, not sure if you already talked about it, but any chance you're going to be trying Bot Colony again?
[269:13.65]No.
[269:15.05]We got all the content from Bot Colony in 12 minutes.
[269:20.14]What am I going to do?
[269:22.84]What am I gonna do?
[269:25.75]Am I gonna have him pick up the chair again?
[269:27.13]No.
[269:28.77]I can't.
[269:29.13]I cannot play Balcony again.
[269:32.59]As much as I would like to.
[269:38.07]Uh, but thank you, Haven.
[269:39.65]Also have this too.
[269:40.39]Thanks.
[269:40.63]For the two bucks.
[269:43.25]OG Jephthah, thanks for the one dollar.
[269:45.59]It would only cost fifteen dollars a year for the online multiplayer on Switch.
[269:51.47]Wait, what?
[269:53.20]15 bucks a year for the online multiplayer.
[269:57.81]Is that true?
[269:58.61]That's cool.
[269:59.25]Well, thank you, OG.
[270:01.01]Thank you, Pebbles, again, for the $1.
[270:02.31]Streamer kills innocent creatures live on stream for entertainment.
[270:06.25]That is pretty much what you're watching.
[270:09.51]There's no story here where these monsters are evil.
[270:12.05]They're not controlled by some demon.
[270:14.09]They're just animals.
[270:17.85]And it's not like there are too many of them.
[270:19.95]I don't understand why we're doing this.
[270:23.87]I am no longer going to play this game for moral reasons.
[270:28.47]I'm going to return it.
[270:30.86]But thanks, dude.
[270:31.40]Thank you also to Reaper500 for the $1.
[270:33.30]Hey, Jeremy, it's me, Demon Lord Zaraxus.
[270:35.84]Telling you that I did indeed steal your soul while you were fighting that monster.
[270:39.08]Owen, you will have to fight me in the next Rumble if you want it back.
[270:44.12]Ta-ta for now.
[270:48.97]I'll get it back.
[270:51.60]saw dust bunnies thanks for the two dollars bring the cats that was another thing too we were just like gimping ourselves from I didn't even know I didn't how I didn't know that if you had two people who thought you had four and there was only one multiplayer version and we're a single player or four player we were just playing on super hard mode for no reason but yes the cats will be there from now on thank you high lord nameless for the 50 cents big wow
[271:20.20]And then to wrap it up, to end it here, OG Jeff Tor, for the $4, one Germa for every Jupiter.
[271:27.72]What's happening?
[271:30.95]You act as if it was really bad, you just died like once.
[271:34.97]Yeah, but like I said before, this is one of those games... Alright, listen.
[271:41.65]This is one of those games...
[271:43.84]that has a lot of people that know exactly what they're doing, right?
[271:48.44]And when you have a bunch of people that know the ins and outs of the whole game, and somebody that's kind of a beginner, it's really easy to, like, really annoy people and have people be, like, angry with you for not understanding a portion of the game that you don't know or that you missed or you skipped over or you're, you know, trying to take it all in.
[272:09.70]And I do understand parts of that sentiment.
[272:13.64]Because if you have played a shitload of Monster Hunter and you kind of already know what's going on, somebody just being like, how do I make the sword?
[272:23.46]What do I do with this menu?
[272:24.72]I guess it can be kind of irritating, but at the same time, it's a learning process.
[272:31.01]So it's like that trying to like balance between, look, I know what I'm doing and I have no idea what I'm doing.
[272:38.72]Can be sort of difficult sometimes.
[272:40.02]Are you gonna play Dark Souls Remastered so five people can carry you through Blighttown?
[272:48.82]That's not gonna... I did Blighttown by myself.
[272:51.96]You just didn't see it.
[272:57.35]This is actually not my first Monster Hunter game.
[272:59.59]I played about 10 to 15 hours of Monster Hunter, the Wii, the Ultimate, Wii U one.
[273:07.04]I went through about maybe four or five monsters total.
[273:10.37]But that feels like a completely different game to this one.
[273:17.07]But that's going to wrap it up.
[273:20.60]Thank you so much, everybody.
[273:22.78]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[273:24.58]See if we can get some light gun games going.
[273:26.94]That should be an interesting stream.
[273:29.24]I feel like a lot of fucking wacky shit could happen in that stream.
[273:32.26]I'm going to show you my skills.
[273:33.12]I'm very good at light gun games.
[273:35.64]If there's one thing I can guarantee you... Is that you're going to see some real skilled gameplay on Tuesday if we play light gun.
[273:46.16]I am unstoppable in light gun.
[273:48.66]I remember sitting there when I was like 15 playing point blank over and over again.
[273:53.15]I am unmatchable when it comes to light gun games.
[274:00.51]A real light gun, not like a Wii U remote light gun, real light gun.
[274:04.92]When I go to the arcade and I put in that, I put in, again, you know what I do?
[274:08.34]You know, you go to the, you go to your local arcade, you look around, hey, what game do I want to play?
[274:12.18]Hmm, I don't know, let me put in like five, ten bucks and get fifty quarters, fifty tokens.
[274:18.53]I go in there with a dollar bill, and I stay there for four hours.
[274:23.07]One dollar bill, all I need is two lives.
[274:27.01]That's two tokens for one.
[274:29.03]You die once, two tokens.
[274:30.23]I beat the whole game in four tokens, guys.
[274:36.90]By the way, yeah, RIP arcades.
[274:39.48]Unfortunately.
[274:46.69]But that's it.
[274:47.19]Take care, everybody.
[274:48.89]See you on Tuesday.
[274:50.37]Have a good rest of your evening.
[274:52.21]Ta-ta for now.
[275:04.29]Alright.
[275:05.61]I like... Oh, before I go.
[275:07.43]Lieutenant Campbell.
[275:08.54]He plays one game and then goes and stands in the corner for four hours.
[275:14.44]Yeah, I play and then I lose and I just go stand in the corner and just sit.
[275:17.50]Alright, goodnight guys.
[275:21.80]See you too.
[275:31.92]Not only that, not only that, I do the claw machine.
[275:36.18]I go there with one dollar, I do the claw machine once and instantly lose and then leave.
[275:41.16]Alright, give me that.
[275:47.66]And it's the giant claw machine.
[275:49.34]The one that's unwinnable.
[275:50.40]The one you cannot win.
[275:51.93]There's no winning in the giant claw machine with the huge stuffed animals.
[275:55.15]They're too heavy.
[275:56.89]It's not gonna happen.
[275:58.82]You see, time and time again, I stand there.
[276:01.69]Burger Boy, I'll get this Burger Boy, quick Burger Boy story.
[276:04.88]We used to go to Dave and Buster's.
[276:07.53]And he would get such joy.
[276:09.31]It was part of his fun time at Dave and Buster's to sit and watch with a beer.
[276:15.83]He wasn't playing any games.
[276:17.21]He wanted to watch the people fail at the giant claw machine.
[276:21.29]That was his entertainment.
[276:22.55]He loved it.
[276:23.49]He would sit there and just take a sip of beer and watch like another guy come up and fail four times and waste $9 and be like, and then take another sip.
[276:33.77]I would walk around and play games, and he would still be sitting there in a stool, watching.
[276:39.23]Laughing.
[276:40.65]And then eventually he'd spend like five bucks on a game, and then we would leave.
[276:43.17]That's what we would do.
[276:49.35]Alright, take it easy.
[276:50.56]Have a good night.
[276:52.00]See you.
[276:53.20]See you in this Twitch chat.
[276:56.64]See you.
[277:04.77]you
