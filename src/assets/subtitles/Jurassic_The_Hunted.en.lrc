[00:00.70]Okay, so this one, you know, we're going to continue our survival.
[00:09.82]Ow, fuck.
[00:10.98]Okay, new game.
[00:12.42]I'm going to update this.
[00:24.32]Okay, this one is called, well, I'll let you see in a second.
[00:28.38]Hold on.
[00:29.59]This might not even be a... I don't think this is even a game on Twitch.
[00:34.05]Let's see.
[00:39.45]Colon.
[00:40.73]It is!
[00:41.09]Okay, cool.
[00:44.93]Alright, I got a new title now.
[00:47.73]And here is the game we're going to play.
[00:52.60]Jurassic the Hunted.
[00:55.75]Survive with a bunch of di- there's like machine guns, and like fuckin' dinosaurs, and alright, so we- we- we don't wanna spoil anything for ourselves!
[01:04.83]Alright, what?
[01:05.75]God damn it, we just like saw the spoiler!
[01:08.78]We just saw like the fuckin' spoiler!
[01:12.64]This game saves data automatically at certain points.
[01:14.74]Do not switch off the power when the- Okay.
[01:17.96]You got it.
[01:19.40]Options.
[01:21.04]Uh, sensitivity, that's- whatever, that's fine.
[01:22.94]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24.84]New game.
[01:26.90]It's like a game of Chuck E. Cheese.
[01:51.94]Chuck E. Cheese.
[01:53.67]Okay, shout him.
[01:54.99]Should've pirated.
[01:56.31]That's the best.
[01:57.09]Okay, shh.
[01:57.71]Okay, Chuck E. Cheese.
[02:11.61]What exactly should we be looking for, Dr. Saris?
[02:13.99]Your father's ship was lost 30 years ago.
[02:16.47]If there's a wreck to find, Ms.
[02:18.89]Saris?
[02:20.09]Oh, Jesus.
[02:20.81]Mayday!
[02:21.37]Mayday!
[02:21.87]Flight Alpha Sierra 2-3-9B going down.
[02:24.55]Ow!
[02:25.35]Entrants wanting to our help.
[02:27.11]Repeat, we are going down.
[02:29.77]Hit the emergency button.
[02:35.97]Don't worry.
[02:36.77]It's real easy.
[02:37.82]You just jump.
[02:39.50]Real easy, you just jump.
[02:41.58]Jump and scream.
[02:45.44]What the fuck happened to that lady?
[02:48.15]Hold on, did that lady just get electric?
[02:49.49]Wait, I can see we're diving out of an airplane.
[02:52.13]Just like in... Okay.
[02:56.37]Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is the code.
[03:01.66]Alright.
[03:02.62]So we're diving out of an airplane.
[03:03.68]I told you it was going to be similar.
[03:11.78]Oh, watch out for that anomaly.
[03:15.87]This takes a long time to load.
[03:17.27]What is this?
[03:17.75]Fucking PlayStation 3?
[03:21.53]Is this game's first person?
[03:27.45]Oh, no.
[03:29.50]Right off the bat, we got, like, fucking Velociraptors.
[03:32.20]Do I have any weapons?
[03:35.10]I have no control of the camera right now.
[03:36.40]I have no control of the character.
[03:40.61]I think we're gonna see like a Tyrannosaurus.
[03:42.37]Yep, they've scattered the T-Rex.
[03:45.82]Camera's gonna pan behind me and it's gonna be a giant monster.
[03:49.40]Find any survivors.
[03:53.46]Okay, no.
[03:53.80]It's not gonna be right behind me.
[03:55.12]Alright, find some survivors.
[03:58.00]Move forward while pressing L3 to sprint.
[04:00.20]Okay.
[04:01.64]Good.
[04:01.92]Good to know.
[04:03.62]X is jump.
[04:08.61]Our circle is crouch.
[04:12.15]Circle is also stand up.
[04:16.47]Alright.
[04:17.86]Found a survivor.
[04:20.12]Survivor.
[04:27.01]Oh, man.
[04:33.67]Oh, he did not just say, what the foxtrot.
[04:36.57]I think he did.
[04:37.03]Yeah, he did.
[04:37.63]He did.
[04:37.94]I'm about to throw up.
[04:40.18]What the foxtrot happened here, guys?
[04:45.90]I wish I could have this sprinting FOV the whole time rather than this puke FOV, but whatever.
[04:49.90]We can't.
[04:50.68]Beggars can't be choosers.
[04:54.31]Alright.
[04:55.11]There's the plane.
[05:00.13]Supplies.
[05:00.61]Probably, yeah, there's a gun in there.
[05:01.52]Alright, there's the one gun that I'm gonna have.
[05:04.36]I wonder if, like, bullets matter in this game.
[05:07.72]By bullets, I mean ammo.
[05:10.11]Take the gun located near the plane wreckage.
[05:17.47]This framerate is awful.
[05:22.65]Oh shit.
[05:23.55]Oh, that's the pilot.
[05:25.07]Oh my god the pilot of the plane turned into a dinosaur Okay, well there he goes All right anything else in the plane no examine oh
[05:46.63]Minus two?
[05:47.37]Come on!
[05:49.01]That was not a minus two.
[05:50.13]That was just a dumb observation.
[05:52.61]That the pilot was actually a dinosaur.
[05:54.41]Whoa!
[06:06.18]Aiming is real hard in this game.
[06:11.97]Can I skin them?
[06:14.81]Aiming is not easy, although there's a fucking down Dilophosaurus.
[06:17.86]Yeah, it does.
[06:21.16]Do I think I'm like dreaming?
[06:22.48]Search the wreckage.
[06:41.34]There's got to be a logical explanation for all this.
[06:44.00]No way!
[06:48.47]Triangle has changed.
[06:49.25]Weapons out.
[06:49.55]We're gonna take... What the hell is going on here?
[07:00.31]Uh, what?
[07:03.51]What is coming through this time warp?
[07:09.84]Why wouldn't you move away from this?
[07:11.47]Dude, I swear to God if, like, Napoleon comes out of this or something, I'm gonna laugh.
[07:15.59]Is it Joe Rogan doing the voice for this?
[07:38.51]All right, you can't you can't just like do that to me Die oh My god
[08:04.93]The whole tower came, the whole video game tower came down.
[08:09.47]Why was that so delayed?
[08:12.55]I did the magic trick and it was like slowly falling the whole fucking time.
[08:18.10]What?
[08:19.82]No.
[08:23.72]I did the Jenga thing and it must've been slowly coming down for like fucking 12 minutes.
[08:30.52]What the fuck?
[08:31.20]And that was in a perfect spot too.
[08:34.34]What the hell, man?
[08:35.40]This is a disaster.
[08:36.70]Oh, this is a disaster.
[08:41.66]This is a disaster.
[08:44.10]This is $400 worth of... Spent $400 on this and like a couple of them are broken.
[08:50.24]This one's broken.
[09:03.49]$4,000.
[09:03.51]We're good.
[09:07.71]I'm just kidding.
[09:10.19]Everything's fine.
[09:10.73]Everything's fucking fine.
[09:16.94]I just scooped them up and put them.
[09:18.54]We're fine.
[09:19.48]You can't break a fucking disc.
[09:20.68]Don't worry about it.
[09:28.73]I'm actually surprised that it fell.
[09:32.21]It fell like fucking 20 minutes later.
[09:35.69]That must have been like some real physics shit, man.
[09:42.42]Somebody has to give me like the scientific explanation.
[09:44.66]So I did like the magic trick, like rip the thing out and it worked and it was fine.
[09:48.32]That was slowly falling for 20 fucking minutes.
[09:52.14]How fucked up is that?
[09:55.06]50 mounted gun parts.
[09:55.86]Collect enough of these parts to... Okay.
[10:01.05]One out of one.
[10:01.81]Okay, that's all I needed.
[10:02.59]Okay, when we get... I want to see the first T-Rex of the game.
[10:09.20]You know what I mean?
[10:16.70]It was the rotation of the Earth.
[10:17.90]I wouldn't be surprised if that actually is what it is.
[10:20.22]Something like weird gravity situation.
[10:22.36]Press the L1 button to activate adrenaline mode.
[10:24.90]And shoot the vital organs for extra damage.
[10:31.92]Okay.
[10:36.00]Um... How does this work, by the way?
[10:41.62]Uh... Okay, so it...
[10:45.96]Well, I thought it was gonna, like, give me a second.
[10:49.92]Alright, easy.
[10:53.96]He's dead?
[10:55.04]Not dead.
[10:55.34]Alright, what's that achievement?
[10:58.08]Can you see that on the screen?
[11:02.16]Whoa.
[11:06.86]The name of that fucking achievement was just, whoa.
[11:13.38]Pretty good name for an achievement.
[11:14.73]What did I do?
[11:15.51]Nothing.
[11:19.43]Got some extra super shotgun ammo.
[11:21.10]Good thing there's a thing on the... Okay, let's go.
[11:26.26]The meme lives again.
[11:27.98]I know.
[11:29.90]Even the achievement was surprised that I did something.
[11:32.10]Whoa.
[11:34.28]Somebody downloaded this game and installed it.
[11:36.82]And got past the first 12 seconds?
[11:39.99]Whoa!
[11:42.27]Nice.
[11:42.49]This is what I'm talking about.
[11:43.13]This is what I came here for.
[11:46.79]The French horn dinosaur.
[11:50.69]There's a boat down here.
[11:57.56]Remember I told you about fucking Napoleon?
[12:00.96]He better not show up.
[12:09.22]You're not gonna... Oh, really?
[12:10.06]Well, they're not gonna give me control.
[12:11.13]Of course they're not.
[12:13.73]That's not a T-Rex.
[12:16.23]That's like the T-Rex equivalent of Snoopy's weird cousin Spike.
[12:21.89]That's not a T-Rex.
[12:23.43]That's not Snoopy.
[12:25.45]Come on.
[12:34.91]Find a way to the ship.
[12:35.59]That big cargo ship has got to be around here.
[12:45.63]I was going to shoot it, but it took me off guard too quickly.
[12:58.65]Got him.
[13:01.69]Who cares?
[13:02.11]I didn't even do anything.
[13:02.96]I just wasted Adrenaline Rush.
[13:10.20]Headshot.
[13:10.96]Oh, don't matter.
[13:12.12]Yep, okay.
[13:14.65]Apparently you gotta shoot him more than once in the head.
[13:16.39]They're not people, I forgot.
[13:18.69]Like, human beings can take like one bullet in the head and they're gone.
[13:22.10]Dinosaurs have to take like seven, because they have much thicker craniums.
[13:30.92]Every game has bullet time.
[13:33.85]Yeah.
[13:34.87]Is that implying that I just ran really fast over to this?
[13:43.13]And you can play like rock music.
[13:53.60]Now we're just playing beachhead.
[14:00.30]These guys didn't even do anything.
[14:01.96]Why am I focusing on these guys?
[14:03.92]He's just frozen in the air.
[14:05.99]All right, well, now he's exploded.
[14:10.03]Oh, easy.
[14:10.59]All right.
[14:15.85]Here's the Chuck E. Cheese game you guys are talking about.
[14:19.28]Hostile?
[14:19.80]No.
[14:25.32]Exactly how is this game a hunting game?
[14:31.42]There is ammo, you're right.
[14:32.36]Oh, no, it's alright.
[14:33.64]I can just take out the branch and put another tree branch in and be fine.
[14:36.34]I was going to take out the Hershey bar and put another long, king-sized Hershey bar in.
[14:43.76]And you were good to go.
[14:45.78]Plus fucking five.
[14:46.56]I don't care what anybody says.
[15:02.62]I'm just being mean now.
[15:03.68]Okay, whatever.
[15:10.62]Saving.
[15:11.42]Found a save point.
[15:13.78]Minus zero is the best I can do.
[15:20.19]Oh, by the way, you might see another one of those...
[15:24.16]You might see another one of those streams very soon here.
[15:26.88]I was talking to Italics, and we were talking about certain games that we might be able to do another, um... Why does that keep happening?
[15:41.47]Do I keep falling out of those?
[15:42.85]I'm being followed by these things.
[15:53.74]Four hour challenge, Bear Grylls.
[15:59.70]Every time I use the radio, this thing shows up.
[16:05.27]Maybe that's the problem.
[16:11.75]I can't hear what he's saying.
[16:18.44]Dude, these are just big lizards.
[16:20.94]Don't start freaking out on me.
[16:24.05]Look at these camera angles.
[16:33.26]Oh.
[16:33.58]Dinosaurs.
[16:36.42]Dinosaurs.
[16:37.68]Smash him up.
[16:38.51]Smash him up.
[16:39.01]Put him in a stew.
[16:39.67]Remember that one?
[16:42.47]Remember that meme that you guys have seen before?
[16:44.19]Alright.
[16:52.40]Follow the trail.
[17:01.12]This game is one of those boring, dumb games where you just shoot a bunch of the same dinosaur.
[17:05.80]It really is a fucking Chuck E. Cheese game.
[17:12.58]What?
[17:17.59]Why would the dinosaurs be coming out of time warps in their own time period?
[17:23.75]Jesus.
[17:27.21]How does that make any sense?
[17:29.09]Aren't we in the Jurassic period right now?
[17:31.72]Why would they be coming out?
[17:32.80]What time period are they coming from?
[17:37.58]Right?
[17:37.78]Doesn't that make no sense?
[17:42.47]Aren't they part of this time period?
[17:45.45]Unless I'm missing something.
[17:47.03]Are the dinosaurs around now?
[17:48.17]Are we all coming back in time?
[17:56.35]Oh, it's two weeks before the current events.
[17:59.41]God.
[18:00.83]What a dumb... Oh, I hate it.
[18:06.27]I know we can't next.
[18:07.57]I told you guys that this is... This is a shit, but this shit was 400 bucks.
[18:13.34]What do you want me to do here?
[18:15.94]You want me to drunkenly stumble around?
[18:17.28]Okay.
[18:21.01]There's no real indication of if this is actually working.
[18:24.87]I guess I just kind of have to wing it.
[18:27.75]Okay, that works.
[18:30.19]You can't... No, we can't next.
[18:31.11]No, like, we have to give every game at least 30 minutes.
[18:37.78]I didn't drop, like, fucking $4,000 on these games to, like, just get rid of them instantly.
[18:42.08]You know what I mean?
[18:42.54]We gotta give at least 30 minutes.
[18:45.02]How do you melee?
[18:45.41]Okay.
[18:51.94]You're going to get Tokyo Jungle.
[18:53.60]I told you I was going to do one run with the alligator before I stopped the stream.
[19:06.40]Look, there's going to be a point in this game where we all go, holy shit, that was worth playing, right?
[19:11.86]It's going to happen after the spider came.
[19:15.44]What is this?
[19:17.72]One use of this pickup and you'll have unlimited adrenaline for 30 seconds.
[19:21.02]Use it wisely.
[19:21.76]Okay, well... Is this what you're going to teach me how to use this?
[19:34.71]This game is making...
[19:38.37]I thought they were harmless.
[19:39.89]This game is making my hangover worse is what somebody said.
[19:43.17]Why do you have a hangover at like 930 at night?
[19:46.31]It's almost 10 o'clock at night.
[19:47.43]You have a hangover?
[19:51.53]Why don't you go to bed?
[20:02.54]Here we go.
[20:04.38]Here comes the... Oh, there's a... Is that supposed to be a T-Rex?
[20:09.22]Eliminate the Utahraptor.
[20:12.78]The raptor from fucking the Midwest of the United States.
[20:15.08]There's actually a Utahraptor?
[20:20.42]There is not a raptor called the Utahraptor.
[20:22.61]They're shooting him in like the lungs?
[20:37.99]What a small brain he has, too.
[20:44.61]This is the most pathetic boss fight I think I've ever done in a video game.
[20:48.34]And look, there's another one right here, guys.
[20:50.92]Where is it?
[20:51.24]There was another one of those Utah rap- No, not Utah.
[20:53.44]There was another- You know what I'm trying to say.
[20:55.50]There was another- Wasn't there another one of those things?
[21:05.55]I thought I saw one of those swirly DNA things over here.
[21:10.29]How did you even lose?
[21:11.13]Do I have a health bar?
[21:12.53]I don't think I have a health bar.
[21:14.63]Hey, go back to fucking Utah.
[21:24.59]Six foot turkey.
[21:25.71]Okay.
[21:32.24]What's in there?
[21:32.72]Dog shit?
[21:33.58]Mm-hmm.
[21:33.72]Mm-hmm.
[21:40.90]All right.
[21:43.06]Hey, thank you, D. Gemberman, for the $4.
[21:48.39]I'm actually a physicist at UML, and let's be real, that's some demon shit.
[21:57.25]Thanks, dude, for the $4.
[21:58.25]Thank you also, most of the loss of the $5.
[21:59.33]There has to be a logical explanation for this.
[22:03.46]There is not.
[22:04.92]Guaranteed.
[22:07.39]We have to get to like the first big monster, right?
[22:09.31]There's probably like a Kraken in this game.
[22:10.77]It's one of those stupid fucking time travel games.
[22:25.82]Of course a game like this is gonna have a fucking Kraken.
[22:27.76]You guys know that for a fact.
[22:31.17]There's gonna be a Kraken, there's gonna be like a Dire Wolf, there's gonna be a gigantic like Sif Wolf.
[22:37.39]Really?
[22:37.65]And there's gonna be jump scares and shit, you all know that's gonna happen.
[22:48.40]I don't have time powers yet.
[22:50.57]They're probably pretty close though.
[22:54.85]Thank you Jest for the lols for the bits.
[22:56.65]They just say Kappa.
[22:59.82]Sly161, thanks for the five bucks.
[23:01.50]Yes, Jerma, Utah raptors are real and actually look like the velociraptors from Jurassic Park.
[23:07.32]Real velociraptors are the size of chickens.
[23:12.63]Oh, how unscary.
[23:13.51]I would squash them.
[23:15.23]But thank you, Sly, for the five bucks.
[23:16.49]Satan's Weed Whacker, thanks for the bits.
[23:17.81]Well, Jerma, my house is boarded up.
[23:19.15]Now I have to leave at around 4 or 5 a.m.
[23:20.89]to get somewhere safe.
[23:21.75]Wish me luck.
[23:22.43]Damn, are you serious, dude?
[23:26.28]Holy shit.
[23:26.78]Well, be careful, man.
[23:28.42]Take care of yourself.
[23:31.96]Hopefully that shit doesn't do anything bad.
[23:34.70]Good luck, man.
[23:35.48]Take care.
[23:37.00]Be safe.
[23:44.16]Jurassic chickens.
[23:47.62]Pick up grenades.
[23:48.86]See, now the game gets fun.
[23:50.44]Hold on a second.
[23:51.78]What the fuck is going on right now?
[23:53.49]I don't even know what I'm aiming at.
[23:57.62]Where the fuck am I?
[23:58.46]What is going on?
[23:58.94]Why am I in, like, drunk vision?
[24:02.18]I'm just, like, shit-faced.
[24:08.40]You've been killed.
[24:13.57]Alright.
[24:14.43]Well... Okay.
[24:23.67]I don't know if this is to accept.
[24:24.87]Okay.
[24:25.87]No next.
[24:26.43]No.
[24:26.81]No.
[24:26.95]We're about to get grenades.
[24:28.75]No next.
[24:30.06]It has only been like 18 minutes.
[24:37.02]The next next, by the way, is... What?
[24:41.59]Oh.
[24:42.61]The next next, by the way, is we're going to play Tokyo Jungle for like 20 minutes.
[24:51.82]Yes, I will agree with you.
[24:52.64]This game is real bad.
[24:54.00]But look, we have to see the first Tyrannosaurus.
[24:58.55]We can't stop playing this game until we get to the first area like that.
[25:02.15]The first Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[25:04.67]Right?
[25:06.39]Is that fair?
[25:11.61]Don't ever aim down sights in this game.
[25:13.25]There's no reason for it.
[25:19.74]That was an interesting Dark Souls roll.
[25:22.20]Remember, everything has to be compared to Dark Souls.
[25:25.22]Man vs. Wild was better.
[25:27.88]Well, that's what happens when you roll the fucking PS3 video game roulette.
[25:44.21]Alright, where the fuck did you come from?
[25:48.33]What do you guys think?
[25:49.37]Do you think this game made more than a net profit of, like, 1400 bucks?
[25:55.31]What do you think?
[25:56.69]You think it's possible?
[26:01.29]I mean, we are talking PlayStation 3.
[26:04.08]So, this could have been on the store at GameStop or something, and you might just buy it, like, holy shit, dinosaurs and shit?
[26:08.98]Chuck E. Cheese and shit?
[26:10.24]Nice.
[26:17.05]Yes.
[26:18.11]This game probably made like 50 million dollars for all we know.
[26:20.65]Might be.
[26:22.63]You don't know that.
[26:26.49]You don't know.
[26:28.05]I don't know either.
[26:34.38]Use the grenade to destroy the wall.
[26:35.70]Alright.
[26:38.40]I'm the only person that's ever bought the game.
[26:43.02]Well, that's not... No way.
[26:47.18]Okay, I gotta be prepared for this, because here come a bunch of people, right?
[26:50.88]Grenades.
[26:52.98]I have a bunch of stylehands.
[26:56.14]Alright, now I gotta... How do you throw a grenade?
[27:02.19]I don't know how you throw a grenade.
[27:03.81]There isn't really a grenade button, is there?
[27:06.35]There it is.
[27:06.69]Alright, well, that's what they wanted me to do.
[27:14.85]Hack hunting.
[27:15.73]That was a late achievement.
[27:18.79]Fucking god.
[27:19.85]Get out of here.
[27:24.48]Come on, I'm doing the stupid Max Payne mode.
[27:26.38]The first game to ever do that.
[27:29.06]And every single video game copied Max Payne.
[27:32.62]And no one ever stopped.
[27:35.96]Max Payne came out and did like a slow motion mode.
[27:40.12]And then it never stopped.
[27:42.16]Ever.
[27:42.28]Never.
[27:46.84]And it still, to this day, has never stopped.
[27:49.33]People are still talking about Max Payne.
[27:51.67]The people that are developing games now are like, you know what we should put in our game?
[27:55.23]Remember Max Payne?
[27:56.99]Yeah, I played that game last week for the first time.
[27:59.09]Fuck, man, that was cool.
[28:02.12]We should put a Max Payne mode move in our game.
[28:09.20]That's how you get it done.
[28:09.88]Mm-hmm.
[28:13.99]Yep.
[28:16.36]That's how you get it done.
[28:19.07]I should play Max Payne 3.
[28:22.45]That's not a bad idea.
[28:25.85]Moon's way too big.
[28:26.71]What planet are we on?
[28:33.26]Alright, I'm getting... You know what?
[28:37.60]I agree with Chat now.
[28:40.34]I would rather play- I would rather fucking play the Bear Grylls game than this game.
[28:46.80]Is that terrible?
[28:48.25]What's- is that really that bad to say?
[28:49.83]I would rather play Bear Grylls the video game than this real video game.
[28:54.55]And that's assuming that Bear Grylls is- that that game is not a real video game.
[28:57.03]How- how fucked up is that?
[29:07.52]I gotta get to a point where we're not just doing the same thing.
[29:09.72]And this is just a tutorial, right?
[29:13.97]Right?
[29:14.21]Hold on, we gotta get a fucking... You guys gotta be proud of me on this one.
[29:18.13]Come on.
[29:19.11]Come on, everybody.
[29:19.85]All of you.
[29:20.39]Aggro everyone.
[29:21.93]And then make it fucking proud.
[29:23.59]Everyone's gonna be proud.
[29:24.45]Here we go.
[29:25.79]Three, two, one.
[29:31.42]Be proud of me.
[29:35.50]Be proud of me.
[29:38.06]Nice.
[29:38.38]Are you proud of me?
[29:43.18]Back to Bear Grylls.
[29:46.32]This is like 70% through the game.
[29:48.50]Are you serious?
[29:54.93]That would have died if I didn't do that, by the way.
[29:58.81]Okay, son.
[29:59.47]Thank you.
[30:00.29]Somebody's proud of me.
[30:05.20]Cutscene.
[30:05.64]That means we're getting close to the end of the game.
[30:12.07]Survive in the fort until you've killed all the enemy waves.
[30:14.27]No!
[30:14.53]Recharge state.
[30:18.13]Is this just a wave shooter now?
[30:22.09]Oh, God.
[30:27.13]It's just a wave shooter.
[30:29.41]I can't get over the Chuck E. Cheese thing.
[30:33.01]Repair?
[30:33.55]Oh, is this fucking COD Zombies?
[30:38.49]Oh, Lord.
[30:39.35]It really is just Zombies.
[30:43.80]Pick up ammo.
[30:45.80]Oh no.
[30:46.74]This is dumb.
[30:54.68]Oh no, they're getting through!
[30:55.64]I gotta train them!
[31:01.39]Prepare the wall.
[31:09.97]That didn't work!
[31:12.96]I thought I could throw it through the wall.
[31:20.34]Don't you just wish that, like, if you've been playing a game sometime, even back in, like, the PlayStation 3 era, right?
[31:27.33]This game had to have cost, like, at least, like, a million dollars, right?
[31:29.67]Like, probably, like, a couple million dollars.
[31:32.75]Don't you wish those developers just, like, donated it to a fucking school?
[31:36.79]You know what I mean?
[31:39.49]You could have bought, like, fucking a bunch of textbooks for, like, children.
[31:44.06]This game is probably like four million dollars.
[31:45.64]Imagine like the amount of like fucking school lunches that buys for like a bunch of kids.
[31:53.58]No, we got this game.
[32:05.09]How much longer do I have to do this?
[32:09.00]Alright, he's like stuck in here now.
[32:16.69]Imagine how many school lunches you could buy for kids instead of $400 worth of shitty PlayStation 3 games.
[32:27.29]No, that's not the point.
[32:28.78]That's not the point, okay?
[32:30.08]The point... That ain't the point.
[32:40.84]Look, you might have a point, but that's not the point.
[32:42.84]The point is that $400 is different than $4 million.
[32:46.65]If I had four million dollars, maybe I'd buy a fucking school, okay?
[32:51.35]I don't have four million dollars.
[32:53.33]I have four hundred.
[33:00.20]This music is too loud.
[33:01.50]And can we please be done with this?
[33:03.46]I need to get to the dinosaur.
[33:05.26]Not the same dinosaur.
[33:06.40]A different dinosaur.
[33:07.36]Watch this one.
[33:08.16]Fucking Park Champ!
[33:14.81]Where'd that go?
[33:19.40]I love how the game goes to 60 FPS in the sky, by the way.
[33:21.96]Look at that.
[33:22.28]Oh, it blew up in the sky.
[33:27.28]Okay, I get it.
[33:31.40]It blew up the moon.
[33:38.47]Dude, remember, for every, like, extra 10 seconds that this game goes on, like, for every extra 10 seconds that this wave-based encounter is, that's 20 school lunches.
[33:49.86]You know what I mean?
[33:51.64]If this had ended, like, fucking five minutes ago, that, you know, that ain't so many school lunches.
[33:57.56]If they made this portion of the game, like, two minutes shorter, 40 school lunches.
[34:10.46]I'm just saying.
[34:16.40]I mean, I'm just speaking the truth.
[34:20.97]Each one of these dinosaurs we kill is like a Steakums school lunch with french fries.
[34:28.42]Find a way to the camp.
[34:30.82]This looks like someplace I can hole up.
[34:34.56]Feels like I haven't slept in years.
[34:36.66]It's Jurassic Park.
[34:46.91]Jurassic Park, the lost school lunches.
[34:56.98]Feeding french fries to school kids, what are you kidding me?
[35:02.10]Fuck this like healthy school lunch dog shit that we're talking about, no.
[35:06.46]No.
[35:07.58]When I was a kid, we had like steak and cheese subs, like meatball subs, french fries.
[35:12.52]We had like deli meat day, we had like taco days.
[35:16.21]I don't want a fucking apple.
[35:17.85]Get it out of here.
[35:19.21]You wanna give me an apple in my school lunch?
[35:21.05]No, I want a fucking steak and cheese sandwich.
[35:23.47]That's how you get brain power to your kids.
[35:25.55]Not an apple.
[35:27.24]Apple like in crackers.
[35:28.52]Oh, you fucking kidding me?
[35:29.58]No, steak and cheese sub.
[35:31.30]That's how you get the real fucking brain power.
[35:38.64]You fill up on meat and cheese.
[35:40.24]That's how you get to be smart in this country.
[35:41.98]That's how you do it.
[35:43.88]You may be proud of me on this one.
[35:52.96]Everybody wants to be so healthy.
[35:53.68]Look, I'm healthy.
[35:54.70]Look at how I turned out.
[35:55.98]I ate french fries every day.
[35:58.44]You know what else I did?
[35:59.24]I had like peanut butter too.
[36:01.14]I had like fruits, french fries, peanut butter.
[36:04.73]Sometimes at the same time.
[36:06.61]And look at how I turned out.
[36:10.75]Smarter than the average bear.
[36:28.37]I had lettuce.
[36:30.23]I had tomato.
[36:31.07]And sometimes there was onions.
[36:36.67]Sauerkraut.
[36:40.07]What the fuck?
[36:43.51]How do I get up there?
[36:44.45]Where does nobody go?
[36:46.40]What?
[36:52.42]Look, don't ever talk shit to me unless you've eaten a lettuce sandwich before.
[36:58.51]I see a lot of people in chat talking to shit.
[37:00.45]Let's fucking dispel this notion that you talk shit, you're not going to get fucking hit with some knowledge.
[37:06.37]You know what I mean?
[37:06.85]What if I make a landslide?
[37:09.85]How do you even want to do that?
[37:18.48]Fuck.
[37:24.88]What was I saying?
[37:27.02]Oh, okay, anyways.
[37:29.19]If you've never had a lettuce sandwich before, we're talking like you take two pieces of bread, you're fucking hungry, you get home from school, you had a fucking, you had a disgusting school lunch.
[37:38.68]It was like fucking, it was an apple and like a slice of cheese.
[37:41.48]And like, come on, what the fuck?
[37:42.38]And you go to your fridge, there's nothing in there.
[37:44.51]You take the bread, you put it in the toaster oven, slab a bunch of mayonnaise on it when it comes out, bunch of shredded lettuce, close it, eat the mayonnaise lettuce sandwich.
[37:52.89]And if you tell me that's not tasty, go try it one day.
[38:04.94]Maybe you might put a little bacon on there.
[38:06.26]You know what I mean?
[38:08.04]You might put a little bacon on there.
[38:10.81]And you might, like, you have a lettuce, mayo, and bacon sandwich.
[38:15.95]And you're trying to tell me that that's not good.
[38:18.25]And, you know, if you're feeling frisky, you throw a tomato, too.
[38:22.46]So you eat a lettuce sandwich with mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato with some bacon.
[38:26.62]You never had that before?
[38:30.60]Don't ever tell me you haven't had that.
[38:32.17]Try it.
[38:38.49]It's just a BLT.
[38:46.07]Look, I turned out alright.
[38:47.46]Watch this one.
[38:51.22]This really is giving me a headache.
[38:55.04]Don't be dead.
[38:55.74]Get me out of this.
[38:56.84]This fucking skateboard video lens.
[38:59.98]Am I killing dinosaurs or am I grinding at like Stop and Shop?
[39:03.29]Like, come on.
[39:13.36]Yeah, I know.
[39:13.92]Gotta go up here and fucking go find some lettuce sandwich.
[39:23.91]Why is the shotgun so much slower to shoot?
[39:25.51]Come on.
[39:33.21]Are we still playing?
[39:34.23]Yes, we are still playing this game.
[39:40.50]We're gonna play this game until I'm satisfied.
[39:42.32]Oh my god, I love someone who's real.
[39:49.24]Oh my god, this game sucks.
[39:57.67]You don't think I feel bad for the people that are just like barely coming into the stream?
[40:01.27]And they see like a dinosaur game and they think it's gonna be cool?
[40:05.17]I'm so sorry.
[40:06.55]I'm sorry that you have to endure this.
[40:08.63]But this is a PlayStation 3 streamer.
[40:10.12]I'm a 2000s gamer streamer.
[40:13.08]This better not kill me.
[40:15.86]Shit.
[40:17.62]Oh, fuck.
[40:18.14]Come on.
[40:20.28]I gotta be careful.
[40:21.23]I don't wanna... I actually don't wanna lose.
[40:22.69]So, hold on.
[40:28.77]We're good.
[40:31.67]Place the C4.
[40:33.93]Welcome to the jungle.
[40:35.47]Is that how many seconds?
[40:36.21]Why is it counting up?
[40:39.01]Oh.
[40:39.73]Okay.
[40:40.37]Now it's counting down.
[40:43.02]Hey!
[40:43.46]Hey!
[40:43.78]Hey!
[40:44.32]Hey.
[40:47.62]What the fuck?
[40:51.40]I gotta get away from this.
[40:52.22]I have to get away from this.
[40:53.02]This is gonna explode.
[40:58.28]Go.
[41:00.79]See, like, I had steak and cheese subs at school and I turned out alright.
[41:03.65]Alright, uh, we got, we got a pokey.
[41:15.00]I knew it was distance, it was, I was just kidding.
[41:17.96]Come on.
[41:18.68]It was a joke.
[41:19.35]We're talking about school lunches and shit.
[41:20.85]90% of the things I say aren't even real.
[41:24.05]You know, come on.
[41:24.77]Like, give me at least a little bit of slack.
[41:27.77]99% of everything I say is not real.
[41:30.35]You don't know what's real?
[41:31.07]None of you guys know what's real and what's not real.
[41:33.63]For instance, I'm gonna give you two truths and a lie, okay?
[41:36.93]Two truths and one lie.
[41:38.05]See if you guys can figure it out.
[41:39.71]No, two lies and one truth.
[41:40.99]We're gonna play that game.
[41:43.49]Okay, the... I... Wait a second, let me... Two truths and one lie.
[41:55.25]No, how do you play that game?
[41:56.19]Okay, here we go.
[41:58.31]So here we go.
[41:59.55]When I was younger, I used to eat dog food.
[42:04.29]Like out of the can.
[42:05.33]I would eat it and it was weird, I know.
[42:07.19]I used to eat dog food out of the can.
[42:09.51]Second thing.
[42:11.05]One time I broke my arm and never went to the hospital and my arm is just fucked up for life.
[42:15.52]I never went to the hospital because I didn't care.
[42:18.24]And I had like a weird fucked up broken arm for like three months.
[42:23.08]And the next one, I pee the bed every morning.
[42:26.56]I have a bedwetting piss problem.
[42:29.29]Gotcha.
[42:29.73]They're all true.
[42:30.79]Okay?
[42:31.59]All of them.
[42:43.30]Can I please get out of this game?
[42:47.94]There's three truths and no lies.
[42:51.44]That's the game we were just playing.
[43:06.11]This might be in the top five Boris games I've ever played.
[43:11.98]That's a really strong statement I know, but like really?
[43:15.74]And then there's a grenade that I threw and it bounced off the wall and went that far back.
[43:24.09]Explode.
[43:26.97]Oh no.
[43:32.48]We just need to get to the fucking T-Rex.
[43:33.92]I just want to see the T-Rex.
[43:36.14]And stop playing it.
[43:37.04]I know.
[43:37.74]I know.
[43:45.09]God.
[43:48.91]There's a lot of nexts in that chat that I have to ignore.
[44:03.46]Alright, it's gator time.
[44:05.32]Yeah, it's gator time.
[44:06.08]We're not doing this again.
[44:11.78]It's gator time.
[44:17.70]An alligator looks like a T-Rex.
[44:19.80]It's going to be gator time.
[44:21.36]I know the game's not funny.
[44:22.38]I know that.
[44:22.90]Come on.
[44:23.64]It's gator time.
[44:33.50]Gator time.
[44:36.01]Give me one second.
[44:36.51]I'm going to switch games.
