[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.67]Good afternoon.
[00:02.31]Hello, everybody.
[00:05.65]It is me.
[00:07.20]Jadami.
[00:07.64]Good to see you again.
[00:10.02]What was that?
[00:10.48]I went like... Alright, the chair's in a weird spot because of the Wii U. What the fuck?
[00:17.46]Did I just break it?
[00:19.50]Did I?
[00:22.60]What?
[00:24.18]No, we're good.
[00:24.70]What the hell?
[00:26.34]Yeah, sorry I'm a little late.
[00:28.50]I was ready to go at 2.
[00:31.09]But the lights were flickering.
[00:34.38]It looked like a power outage was coming.
[00:35.74]We're getting some high winds.
[00:37.28]So the lights were going like... And I didn't want to turn the stream on to have the power just turn off in 20 minutes.
[00:47.53]So it seems like it's fine.
[00:49.59]I think it's good.
[00:50.91]Just wanted to make sure we weren't going to get interrupted.
[00:53.60]Now, wouldn't it be funny if I waited, you know, 45 extra minutes to stream and it just does it anyways in like 20 minutes from now.
[01:02.89]So we'll see.
[01:04.07]I don't know.
[01:04.59]I think we're going to be fine.
[01:09.47]Well, that would be wicked funny.
[01:15.53]You're jinxing it.
[01:16.69]I know this is not like an elaborate routine.
[01:20.33]I promise this is not an elaborate routine.
[01:25.01]So today we're going to play Slime Rancher.
[01:26.42]It's a game that came out a long time ago.
[01:30.70]But I didn't care because it was it was not on Steam.
[01:36.92]Right?
[01:42.45]So.
[01:44.03]And now that it is like a year or two ago or something, it was on Steam.
[01:51.05]I'm talking a long time ago when it first came out, it was on Steam.
[01:57.85]Yeah, no, it wasn't on Steam like a long time ago when it first came out.
[02:04.35]Literally five years ago.
[02:08.20]Was it on Steam when it came out?
[02:10.82]What game am I thinking of?
[02:13.10]Is there another game that's like this that came out on like the Epic Games Store first?
[02:21.23]It's like a completely different game.
[02:28.14]Outer Wilds?
[02:30.84]Is every, like... Is every game that comes out on... Maybe.
[02:35.58]But what does that have anything to do with Slime Rancher?
[02:38.27]Was it... Maybe it was a Crime Rancher?
[02:48.19]Ooblets?
[02:49.05]Maybe.
[02:49.49]I don't know.
[02:51.74]I must be thinking of a different game.
[02:53.14]I didn't play this when it came out for some reason.
[02:54.95]I don't know why.
[02:55.69]I thought it was because it wasn't on Steam and I was too lazy to get the other platform.
[03:00.31]Anywho, Slime Rancher today.
[03:04.65]I will tell you, since our last meeting, that I have started the process of potentially doing GTA RP.
[03:15.47]Jumping in, maybe.
[03:16.27]Talking to some people.
[03:18.51]Getting that going.
[03:20.71]That will probably, maybe... The next few weeks or something.
[03:26.21]Try to get involved.
[03:27.49]Have some fun.
[03:28.26]Make a couple characters.
[03:30.78]Or just one character that I play for literally two or three days.
[03:34.92]And then they get run over by a train.
[03:37.40]I don't know.
[03:42.58]I am hoping... The goal is to have a character that eventually just gets run over by a train.
[03:50.52]Then I just don't ever play it again.
[03:53.94]Oh, Freddy subs.
[03:55.08]Freddy Dredd subs!
[03:57.00]This is the 20 subs.
[03:57.94]Too many subs.
[03:58.80]Too many.
[04:00.16]Thank you, though.
[04:00.56]That's a ton of subs.
[04:02.56]And thanks, uh... No, I'm not going to say that.
[04:05.08]Because I don't want people to do that.
[04:06.55]I was about to... The pre-streamers will know I was about to do like a... Thanks for the... But I'm not going to address that.
[04:20.92]Not enough subs.
[04:28.89]Alright, let's play.
[04:30.89]Let's see how Slime Rancher is.
[04:32.07]I have no idea.
[04:37.64]Create a new game.
[04:38.44]Okay.
[04:41.20]We're gonna go with, uh... We're gonna go with, uh... Jeremy?
[04:45.76]Jeremy?
[04:50.33]Adventure sounds good.
[04:54.91]Choose a save icon.
[04:55.57]Does this matter?
[04:57.37]I feel like I'm in a weird seat right now.
[05:00.03]I'm leaning forward.
[05:02.25]Let me get a little closer.
[05:03.13]I feel like I'm hunching forward to read this.
[05:07.51]Why?
[05:09.43]It's better, right?
[05:10.16]Yeah.
[05:12.04]Choose the cat boy?
[05:12.78]No.
[05:13.86]No.
[05:16.23]jermaSun.

[05:27.66]I like Jerma.
[05:28.54]Jerma Isaac Bomb.
[05:43.19]Which one speaks to me right now?
[05:55.00]Water balloon.
[05:59.12]This doesn't matter.
[05:59.82]Who cares?
[06:00.24]I'm going to pick this one.
[06:02.92]I'm going to pick the most scrumptious cake.
[06:07.05]I feel like this guy right now.
[06:09.29]Good.
[06:09.39]Good.
[06:15.60]Oh, stop.

[06:22.19]Does somebody have it?
[06:23.75]There's no way I have a time stamp of him doing that.
[06:25.69]I need it.
[06:27.81]A thousand light years away from Earth, on a planet known as the Far, Far Range, Bellatrix Lestrange began her journey.
[06:33.94]Okay, whatever that was.
[06:37.61]You made it up.
[06:38.30]No, I didn't.
[06:38.74]I didn't make... Somebody... There was... It's on the second channel.
[06:41.96]On the second Jerma channel, somebody found the clip that I've been referencing for years.
[06:45.60]Somebody found it.
[06:46.68]One of the editors.
[06:47.38]And put it in the beginning of a video.
[06:52.31]And Neelix comes over with a cake.
[06:53.45]And he's like, here is a delicious scroftish cake.
[06:55.73]It's the one I... It's not a mandala... No, it's not a mandala effect.
[06:58.25]It's not.
[06:58.73]It exists.

[07:34.07]Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the vac tank.
[07:37.56]Slimes are key to your success.
[07:40.32]Shoot slimes through a coral barrier into the coral on the ranch.
[07:46.44]Okay, select vac tank and then shoot.
[07:48.94]So you suck them up and you put them in the little area.

[15:41.61]Oh, shit.
[15:42.77]Secret style at StarMail.
[15:45.72]Hi, B. What's it like to sleep for a whole year?
[15:48.28]Did you dream?
[15:48.92]I can't imagine what that's like.
[15:51.00]7ZEE puts you in a pod and then lights up for all that time.
[15:54.48]Wow.
[15:55.38]What's the far, far range like?
[15:56.62]Have you started exploring?
[15:57.96]Is the air as clear as they say?
[15:59.50]I bet it's really beautiful.
[16:01.08]I'm probably asking too many questions.
[16:02.12]I bet you have a lot of work to do.
[16:04.14]I still can't believe it's yours now.
[16:06.12]I guess I better leave you to it and just keep it short.
[16:07.80]Good luck, B. If anyone can make it out there, it's you.
[16:10.89]Thank you, Stardew Mom.
[16:12.90]He's a cool boss, apparently.

[16:16.52]He's really funny.
[16:41.60]Okay.
[16:41.74]Welcome to the Far Range.
[16:58.22]Someone else will read this shit.
[16:59.56]We would like... Yeah, someone else will read this.
[17:02.14]Exercise caution in your first few days on the range until you get more familiar with your surroundings.
[17:05.34]Okay.
[17:06.74]Don't travel at night.
[17:08.22]Should you require any additional tools to your backpack or items to make the Slime Ranch experience easier?
[17:11.48]Yeah, yeah.
[17:12.00]Someone else will read this.
[17:15.01]Sleep until morning.
[17:15.83]Okay.
[17:16.81]What about secret styles?
[17:21.63]Barely cosmetic won't change a slime's diet.
[17:23.43]Oh, they have a diet?

[17:56.79]The name's Hobson Twilgers, rancher, explorer, and the former owner of this here ranch you now call your own.
[18:01.63]Pleased to make your acquaintance.
[18:03.95]I was a rancher here for years that I can... Hey, Miguel, hey, Peter.
[18:09.02]I'm sorry.
[18:09.70]I felt there was one last adventure left for me, so I've set off to find just that.
[18:12.70]Before I go, I'm taking one last tour around this here land I love to keep your peepers peeled for notes like these.
[18:18.77]You want to hear what an old cute has to say every now and again.
[18:21.89]Be talking to you.
[18:23.25]H. You are now understanding the reason why Dark Souls did not let people type their own messages.
[18:29.28]These would be everywhere.
[18:32.28]And like the ASCII art of like Mario shitting.
[18:43.83]How many can I have in one stack?
[18:46.11]More than one?
[18:51.74]Oh my god, did you even suck them all up?
[18:54.59]Food.
[18:55.15]I got fruits.
[18:56.53]Food like fruits, veggies, or chickens are used to feed slimes.
[18:58.83]Try shooting food at a pink slime.
[19:00.35]They'll eat anything.
[19:02.03]No, not yet.
[19:02.71]I need to collect as many as I can.
[19:08.28]They can't breathe.
[19:09.02]Yes, they can.
[19:09.52]There's a breathing mechanism in here.
[19:12.96]How can I hold a butt?
[19:13.58]Up to 20?
[19:13.76]What's that?
[19:19.68]What about these?
[19:21.52]Oh my god.
[19:22.50]Apog fruit.
[19:23.30]The most common fruit found in the range.
[19:24.58]In some states, the most delicious.
[19:25.65]It's like... Okay.
[19:27.61]Oh my god.
[19:29.03]Oh my god.
[19:29.37]This is Luigi's Mansion, but the whole point is to suck everything up and not actually play the game.
[19:34.15]Oh my god.
[19:34.82]It's where everything I wanted is.
[19:36.36]I can't play Luigi's Mansion because I suck everything up in the whole room.
[19:42.59]I tried to play Luigi's Mansion 3.
[19:44.52]I couldn't.
[19:45.74]It took me three hours to visit the first two parts of the mansion.
[19:48.80]Because I kept sucking everything.
[19:56.50]Yes!
[19:56.84]My god, I love it.
[20:03.15]How many can you hold?
[20:06.68]Oh, wait.
[20:07.22]I don't have enough room.
[20:09.20]Can I fit you in a different slot?
[20:11.20]No, I can't fit you in a different slot.
[20:13.36]Eat this carrot.
[20:20.02]It gave me a plort.
[20:20.80]Okay, how many times can it eat?
[20:24.58]You've learned the fundamentals.
[20:25.48]Now it's time to get out there and explore.
[20:26.54]Remember, the best way to become a pro rancher is to experiment.
[20:30.91]What is that?
[20:32.35]Wait, that's a bird.
[20:33.11]This is like a bird.
[20:34.44]How do I pick up the bird?
[20:35.28]I want the bird.
[20:36.26]I want this bird.
[20:36.78]Can I feed the bird a carrot?
[20:39.00]Oops.
[20:42.18]Sorry.
[20:42.52]Just give me more things.
[20:51.15]I want max stacks.
[20:53.55]Alright, you guys hungry?
[20:58.45]Inflort.
[21:03.22]What about the pog fruit?
[21:04.24]Do you like those?
[21:05.94]You don't like pog fruit?
[21:11.06]This is kind of loud.
[21:11.82]Let me turn this down.
[21:13.28]It's like very loud, isn't it?
[21:19.83]Okay, there we go.
[21:21.85]Was it fine?
[21:22.25]I don't want to be too loud.
[21:27.69]That seems like a good level right there.
[21:28.87]Okay.
[21:32.25]Can I tell if they've eaten?
[21:34.94]Alright, pink slimes don't like pogfruits.
[21:37.36]They like carrots, though.
[21:45.84]I want plorts.
[21:51.58]This is so cool.
[21:53.97]Cool.
[21:54.27]Alright, I think I want to get... Can I... Should I just max out the plorts?
[22:00.17]Bonnie, eat up.
[22:03.38]He's ignoring us.
[22:06.54]What?
[22:08.68]Turn it up.
[22:10.20]Turn up the volume.
[22:10.96]No, it's a good place.
[22:14.49]Turn it up.
[22:15.05]It's in a good place.
[22:15.63]It's in a good spot.
[22:24.82]It's in a good place.
[22:25.36]What happens at night?
[22:33.82]Who else hasn't eaten?
[22:42.66]Alright, I think I have to leave.
[22:47.37]120 hurts Andy.
[22:50.27]Alright, I am going to tell you something and I'm going to make a lot of people probably really angry when I say this, but it's what I believe.
[22:56.34]I know that like a hundred years from now, someone's going to look back at a clip of me saying this and they're going to say, wow, what an idiot.
[23:03.68]I can't believe he thought that like the human eye can only see 24 FPS, right?
[23:08.80]I really believe that after you cross like 144 Hertz, you can't tell the difference anymore.
[23:21.64]Like 240 Hertz is, I don't, I can't even see the difference.
[23:27.93]I can't see it.
[23:32.55]With 60 frames a second, which is how most things are built to run.
[23:39.45]The brain can't process like 500 Hertz and like 300 frames a second.
[23:46.58]Wait, I gotta, should I put these in the same cage?
[23:55.34]How many can fit in here?
[23:57.58]Should I be doing this?
[24:06.00]Oh, whoa!
[24:11.34]Give me that money!
[24:17.96]20 pink florets.
[24:18.92]What happened?
[24:21.00]Oh, I thought they died.
[24:21.98]I thought I killed them.
[24:29.43]Anybody else not eating?
[24:34.71]Keep eating and keep giving me money.
[24:37.03]Okay, I gotta sell this stuff.
[24:45.13]This game is awesome.
[24:46.79]This is the... I can't believe it took me like four years to play this.
[24:49.70]Oh, that felt so good.
[24:56.10]More, I need more money.
[24:58.84]more money so you just suck them up is there a way like I can only suck up the money is it like a money gun that I get eventually that's an upgrade oh okay just stand far enough away oh that makes sense
[25:28.06]I'm sorry, I love that.
[25:28.90]I love standing really far away from shit and getting like a slam dunk.
[25:36.40]I have 692 bucks.
[25:37.42]Let me go to the market.
[25:41.22]Should I upgrade something?
[25:43.84]Water tank.
[25:44.38]Adds a specialized vac tank that allows you to store fresh water.
[25:47.26]Cool.

[25:58.59]Whoa High walls Even the bounciest slimes have difficulty escaping Music block plays a soothing tune that gently reduces slime agitation
[26:18.38]A plort collector.
[26:19.32]A plort collector will vacuum up two types of plorts in a quarrel at regular intervals, dispositing them into a storage tank so as long as space is available.
[26:26.44]Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[26:28.98]An auto feeder.
[26:30.52]Whoa.
[26:31.24]High walls?
[26:33.12]How about high walls?
[26:35.25]They can't get out.
[26:36.61]Or a music box?
[26:39.21]Let's do the walls first.
[26:41.67]No, I'm doing plort collector first.
[26:44.85]That was probably stupid.
[26:51.13]Oh, wait.
[26:51.67]Did that... Somebody has one?
[26:54.11]Oh, and then it comes out here?
[26:57.66]What about this chicken?
[27:00.82]A hearty chicken bred to be twice as tasty as its cousin.
[27:03.88]Do we eat this?
[27:04.38]What happens if I do this?
[27:07.63]Oh, shit.
[27:08.17]You ate him.
[27:18.47]Oh, okay.
[27:19.01]Alright, I'm going to go to bed.
[27:21.91]This game is so cool.
[27:23.72]I like this.
[27:24.28]This is really cool.
[27:24.92]I didn't know what this game was.
[27:31.44]I did not know this is what the game was.
[27:38.32]I don't know why, but I thought this game was Pokémon.
[27:43.52]It's a Pokémon game.
[27:44.52]You catch slimes and you battle them.
[27:47.59]No, you didn't... Nobody told me this was like a stock market income simulator where you just collect stuff.
[27:57.82]Nobody... You didn't say the word stock market.
[28:00.14]Somebody escaped?
[28:00.76]Alright, I just gave that guy like negative 20 Gs.
[28:14.85]He ain't going... He's not going to leave again.
[28:22.97]How come my automatic thing didn't work?
[28:30.64]I need higher walls.
[28:33.96]Yes.
[28:37.79]How do I collect it?
[28:38.49]How do I take it out of here?

[28:46.73]I'll be back with food.
[28:47.63]Get out of here.

[32:23.24]Alright, be right back.
[32:34.64]I don't know why I feel like I'm playing Overwatch when that happens.
[32:37.60]This reminds me of an Overwatch gun.
[32:39.60]It shoots out single crystals.
[32:42.04]And if you hold the button down, the last five pellets will do 10% more damage.
[32:49.86]Should I sell the tabi plort?
[32:51.16]Wait.

[35:19.85]Alright, cool.
[35:22.45]Everyone's having a good time.
[35:25.43]How long does it take to grow?

[49:43.77]Are these golden chickens?
[49:47.49]Oh, no.
[49:47.87]These are just regular chickens.

[51:09.01]Is it evil?
[51:09.79]I think it's evil.
[51:13.70]These awful ravenous rainbows.
[51:15.34]Oh.

[51:19.60]This game's too interesting.
[51:21.21]Alright, I need... There it is!
[51:24.79]Um... I need five of these.
[51:30.31]A cubery.
[51:37.07]It looks like they hang on little cube trees.
[51:39.13]Cool.
[51:40.51]Alright, I have a heartbeat, too.
[51:45.90]Come on, I need more of those.
[51:54.57]Lock treasure pod.
[51:55.39]Fuck.
[51:58.21]Plant the beet.
[52:00.23]I know, but I need to... This is so overwhelming.
[52:07.32]Yes!
[52:07.90]Alright, I got five cuberies.
[52:10.70]Oh, no, sorry.
[52:11.14]Let me say that better.
[52:12.12]I have five... I have five... No.
[52:14.94]There we go.
[52:18.43]Flip that one.
[52:20.09]That's the one you could use in your project.
[52:25.95]Alright, now I need a rooster.
[52:27.19]Is there like a quest log or something?
[52:30.49]Because I have five of those, I needed...
[52:40.69]What else did I need?
[52:42.25]A rooster?
[52:47.22]Open the box.
[52:47.96]Open that box.
[52:48.54]Did I miss a box?
[52:49.52]I don't have any room for it.
[52:51.30]I'm not getting rid of my gold plort.
[52:55.64]No, no, no.
[52:56.02]I gotta bring this shit back.
[53:02.76]Go back and sell.
[53:03.36]Yeah, I'm going back and selling.
[53:04.56]Am I even going the right way?
[53:07.96]Um, I think so.
[53:16.39]If you're playing Pikmin 1, it's harder than Pikmin 2.
[53:18.11]No.
[53:18.35]Not gonna play Pikmin 1, sorry.
[53:26.14]Mushroom?
[53:29.52]I really enjoyed Pikmin.
[53:30.58]I thought it was a really cool franchise.
[53:33.54]I've watched the cartoon.
[53:34.85]A liar.
[53:37.59]I didn't watch the YouTube cartoon.
[53:39.65]Just told you I was going to.
[53:42.51]Okay, so I gotta get this right.
[53:44.59]How much does...
[53:48.12]I don't have time to just fuck around.
[53:49.26]Okay, I need... Four of those.
[53:52.13]Where do I even find those flying guys?
[53:54.47]I'll be out here.
[53:55.01]Okay.
[53:55.55]So how do I deposit this?
[53:59.95]Five?
[54:00.55]Wow, it's not... 23 minutes.
[54:01.56]I need five... Four of these and one giant thing.
[54:04.08]Alright.
[54:07.90]A gold plort is worth a lot of money.
[54:12.53]This shit's worth 281 bucks.
[54:13.23]But...
[54:15.94]If I feed a gold plort to one of these little slimes, I will have a golden slime.
[54:21.76]And I will get never-ending golden shits.
[54:23.60]No.
[54:32.73]Don't.
[54:34.21]Don't do it.
[54:35.55]Doesn't work.
[54:36.11]Feed it to a big one.
[54:38.23]So if I feed a golden plort to one of these big cats, it's not going to give me a big golden big cat.
[54:47.75]Stop!
[54:48.88]What?
[54:50.50]Well, first of all, let's feed people chickens.
[54:53.26]Do they eat chicken?
[54:57.44]You guys don't eat chicken?
[55:06.15]They can't eat children.
[55:10.23]They can.
[55:21.28]I guess not.
[55:21.66]Alright.
[55:22.86]I want to plant this heartbeat.
[55:24.78]Can I change the fruit that's on here?
[55:28.66]Remove crops.
[55:29.84]Okay.
[55:30.62]I want to plant the heartbeat.
[55:36.48]10 cents.
[55:39.00]Okay.
[55:40.28]Heartbeat.
[55:43.28]Now growing heartbeats.
[55:44.20]Yeah, they're probably just way better.
[55:45.12]Cool.
[55:49.88]Now I need a chicken coop.
[55:51.96]I only have 22 minutes to get... Okay, I gotta find one of these big chickens.
[56:00.67]What do I do with the chickens?
[56:01.59]I'm just gonna put them in the cage.
[56:03.31]Whatever.
[56:05.49]Like, they're not gonna go anywhere.
[56:08.43]Alright.
[56:09.89]Hurry.
[56:10.21]Four flying purples and one hamster.
[56:17.62]Can I store this in, like, a storage unit?
[56:21.69]Sell the gold.
[56:23.39]Sell the gold.
[56:24.03]No, I'm keeping it.
[56:25.07]I don't want to sell it.
[56:25.65]I'm going to turn it into a golden rooster or whatever.
[56:27.87]I don't know.
[56:31.48]I got an email.
[56:32.02]I don't care.
[56:32.28]Alright, I need the flying things wherever they are.
[56:37.94]I'm going to just explore.
[56:38.74]I have 20 minutes to get it.
[56:46.50]Look for flying shit.
[56:52.62]Ow.
[56:53.00]What about over here?
[56:54.74]Where can I find a flying guy?
[57:01.52]They only come out at night.
[57:05.68]They're flying.
[57:06.14]They look mad.
[57:13.44]Only at night?
[57:14.14]What time is it right now?
[57:20.05]Am I not going to be able to complete this quest?
[57:23.95]Or in caves.
[57:34.77]Caves, caves, caves, caves.
[57:38.52]Caves, caves, caves, caves.
[57:44.06]Sure, but you can find it in a cave.
[57:46.00]Cave, cave, cave.
[57:50.09]Where can I get it?
[57:59.49]Cave?
[58:00.49]Nope.
[58:01.01]There's a big boy.
[58:04.43]Cave?
[58:09.57]I need a cave.
[58:13.64]No cave.
[58:14.62]I see a cave over there.
[58:15.32]Almost walked off the edge.
[58:21.79]This is pretty.
[58:24.94]And the chicken too.
[58:25.72]Yeah, this is locked.
[58:26.72]I can't go in there.
[58:28.68]There's no animals or anything over here.
[58:29.90]Ooh!
[58:38.19]A box!
[58:42.41]Box.
[58:45.08]Drop gold plort in sea.
[58:47.46]Dude, does it turn the whole sea gold?
[58:51.07]Does the whole ocean turn to gold and I can suck up the gold goo?
[58:55.33]You're so fucking cool.
[58:59.03]I found a bird.
[59:08.84]That was really loud.
[59:09.88]Alright.
[59:10.12]I know I need.
[59:12.55]I want a carrot.
[59:13.69]Get rid of this pog fruit.
[59:14.75]Dude, it's going to turn the whole ocean into pog ocean.
[59:20.40]Okay.
[59:21.89]Now I need those flying insects.
[59:25.47]Where are they?
[59:26.03]You dead?
[59:36.73]That was a very graceful end.
[59:38.07]You're joking me.
[59:43.63]Dead.
[59:46.13]I didn't kill him.
[59:46.81]He's...
[59:51.64]Shit, where are these flying insect things?
[59:55.18]I'm running out of time.
[59:56.30]Hurry.
[59:59.80]I almost just jumped over the edge.
[60:04.90]He chose to fall.
[60:05.92]Yeah, he didn't have to do that.
[60:15.43]Oh man, I need a...
[60:19.25]I need these.
[60:19.71]I have to start making money.
[60:24.05]That was a good block.
[60:31.53]Cave.
[60:33.11]I would consider this to be nighttime.
[60:34.37]They're not flying around.
[60:55.60]Shit, come on!
[61:06.71]Need to wait a little longer?
[61:13.37]I'm waiting.
[61:15.43]Don't swear, this is a kid's game.
[61:19.45]Whatever you say.
[61:20.15]Difted truck, you!
[61:30.44]He's really hungry.
[61:32.22]I'll feed you.

[61:33.48]You're really hungry.
[61:35.04]What do you want?
[61:35.52]Get out of here.
[61:39.34]Later.
[61:57.74]It's definitely nighttime.
[61:58.64]Where are they?
[62:07.98]Home, home, home, home, home, home, home.
[62:11.97]Why do I have to go home?
[62:17.69]Fuck this.
[62:21.45]You're full, go home.
[62:26.12]What do I get rid of?
[62:28.22]Beets.
[62:36.85]Don't eat them.
[62:38.00]No.
[62:47.06]Got it.
[62:48.10]Crazy frog.

[63:19.91]Don't eat that.
[63:20.55]Don't eat... How are they getting out?
[63:23.37]Don't eat the chicken.
[63:24.63]Don't eat the chicken.
[63:25.81]They're starving.
[63:27.05]They're all just... Did he eat it?
[63:28.89]He ate it.
[63:33.47]I probably needed one of those.

[65:21.45]What happened?

[65:24.19]What?
[65:24.41]What?
[65:24.89]Get out!
[65:25.19]Get out!
[65:25.45]Get out!
[65:25.75]Get out!
[65:26.01]Get out!
[65:26.81]Get out!
[65:27.15]Get out!
[65:27.43]Get out!
[65:27.69]Get out!
[65:28.13]What happened?
[65:29.25]Oh my god!
[65:29.84]Get these guys out of here!
[65:31.74]What's going on?
[65:32.38]What's going on?
[65:32.80]What's going on?
[65:33.26]What's going on?
[65:33.90]What's going on?
[65:35.00]What's going on?
[65:36.80]What's going on?
[65:38.94]What happened?
[65:40.32]It's a massacre!
[65:42.04]It's a fucking massacre!
[65:43.64]Get out!
[65:43.96]Get out!
[65:44.24]Get out!
[65:44.50]Get out!
[65:44.76]Do I go to sleep?
[65:51.21]Get out.
[65:52.65]Oh my God.
[65:53.05]Go to sleep.
[65:53.63]Go to sleep.
[65:56.38]Go to sleep.
[66:02.04]Okay.
[66:03.00]It's like Minecraft.
[66:04.52]So it's like Minecraft.
[66:05.85]At night, when it gets to be nighttime, those things spawn and start killing people.
[66:11.11]So now that I'm awake, they're gone.
[66:16.55]Okay.
[66:20.41]So don't stay up so late next time.
[66:28.02]Let's... We have to get back to what we were doing.
[66:31.82]Everybody relax.
[66:35.14]Press F1.
[66:48.13]The tar are formed when a large-o eats a plort unlike the ones it produces.
[66:55.57]A terrible transformation occurs that turns slime into a sludge filled with a swirling prismatic array of colors.
[67:02.55]In a relentless appetite, the tar seek only to consume and replicate.
[67:06.34]The only way to stop a tar outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the slime sea is with fresh water.
[67:12.62]One splash will stop a tar from spawning new tar.
[67:14.46]A repeated splash will destroy it entirely.
[67:18.15]Okay.
[67:18.43]So, let me get that correct again.
[67:42.84]If a pink plort, if a pink bunny rabbit thing, cat, eats a, if a pink plort-based slime eats a, oh my God, I almost knocked my coffee over.
[68:01.67]Why is this so hard for me to do?
[68:04.01]When a pink slime eats a blue plort, it turns into this.
[68:20.22]Yes.
[68:21.08]No.
[68:24.02]I want a Larjo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces.
[68:27.09]So, okay, when we feed something, when it shits out two plorts, if it doesn't shit out like a blue plort, if it eats a blue prismatic plort thing, then that's fine.
[68:43.04]You have to feed it whatever it shits out.
[68:45.18]I get it.
[68:46.50]If you feed it something that it does not shit out, it's going to turn into one of those.
[68:50.96]Did they eat the tree?
[69:00.53]They ate the tree.
[69:03.71]Oh, no, no.
[69:04.23]Okay.
[69:04.69]Alright.
[69:04.95]I see.
[69:05.25]I see.
[69:10.27]Okay, I'm understanding.
[69:11.65]I'm understanding.
[69:12.23]Let me just pick up the stray florts.
[69:17.25]I need to put... You go back in here.
[69:18.99]I get it.
[69:19.59]I understand the game.
[69:21.13]Get in there.
[69:24.71]Motherfucker.
[69:29.35]Feed them, you monster.
[69:30.57]I'm trying to get that... First of all... Just wait.
[69:35.05]I need to...
[69:38.74]God damn it.
[69:40.06]Alright, hold on.
[69:49.28]$307.
[69:49.64]Oh my god, I don't care.
[69:51.54]That's so much money, I don't even care.
[69:54.41]Come here, guys.
[70:00.53]Come here.
[70:03.37]Collect everybody back.
[70:09.52]You literally can't do anything else with gold floors.
[70:15.54]At all.
[70:19.53]They're all coming back in.
[70:20.53]Wait, the food's in the cage now!
[70:34.09]You could hold it.
[70:34.95]Yeah, I could.
[70:36.71]Increase in value, yeah?
[70:43.20]Okay.
[70:43.62]Come here.
[70:45.36]This game is really cool.
[70:47.08]I really like this.
[70:48.02]I bet I got everybody killed.
[70:51.39]Stop farming just pink.
[70:58.65]I know, but my tiny brain is still trying to comprehend the game.
[71:03.05]It's going to be pink for a little bit longer.
[71:04.97]Okay.
[71:11.21]Okay, so these are almost done.
[71:14.72]I want to buy the watering thing.
[71:17.12]Pulse wave, cool.
[71:18.80]Push your slimes away.
[71:19.80]That's an upgrade.
[71:20.88]Alright, I want the sprinkler.
[71:22.52]Always water, making them grow twice as fast.
[71:24.62]I want that.
[71:25.10]Makes crops always yield the maximum harvest.
[71:30.03]Yep.
[71:33.11]A scare slime is a stuffed tar model designed to keep wandering slimes away from your crop.
[71:36.93]Simple but terrifying.
[71:41.21]So the wall's higher.
[71:42.01]That's right.
[71:42.81]Do the walls higher on this one?
[71:44.01]It's an air net.
[71:54.72]Okay.
[71:54.92]Cool.
[71:58.52]Much better.
[71:59.10]I'll have much more food.
[72:00.07]One of them survived.
[72:06.47]I love it.
[72:08.85]Come here.
[72:09.15]I'll feed you in a second.
[72:12.61]What do you guys poop out?
[72:15.67]You guys poop out... Do you guys not eat those?
[72:19.50]What do you guys eat?
[72:21.86]What do they... Oh, yeah.
[72:27.96]So you poop out tabby plort and pink plorts.
[72:37.25]They eat everything.
[72:37.99]Okay, so how come you didn't eat the beans?
[72:43.82]So if I feed you a tabby plort, you're going to be very happy about it.
[72:54.05]If I feed him a rock plort, he'll turn into one of those scary things.
[72:58.13]Because it says if you feed them a plort that's not theirs, they turn into a tar thing, right?
[73:02.11]I don't want to do that.
[73:04.94]I could feed a rock plort to one of these.
[73:07.62]And they'll turn into... Aha!
[73:12.26]Cool!
[73:13.34]And then I bring you over here.
[73:14.34]Now I've got you guys over here.
[73:22.24]And then I could do tabby plort.
[73:26.19]Who wants to turn into a tabby?
[73:28.74]Okay, we've got kitties And then these guys have more yield you have to be careful We've got kitties.
[73:43.55]Alright, I get it very very cool I Make a bunch of cats
[73:57.73]Can I make a bunch of big ones?
[73:58.59]Just put them all in here?
[73:59.51]Okay.
[74:10.11]Stay in!
[74:12.43]Yes!
[74:12.61]Okay.
[74:28.42]Because eventually, these guys are going to turn into other ones.
[74:30.29]I'm going to stop.
[74:31.87]What?
[74:32.69]He can't.
[74:33.01]He's not learning.
[74:33.59]What do you mean?
[74:34.61]Eventually, I'm going to have a place for the cats, a place for the rocks, a place... Yeah.
[74:43.35]Separate the rocks.
[74:44.25]Don't... Get the rocks out.
[74:45.51]Get the rocks out.
[74:46.13]Get the rocks... Oh, right.
[74:47.73]Because they'll... I get it.
[74:48.83]I get it.
[74:49.15]I understand.
[74:49.71]I get it.
[74:50.05]I get it.
[74:50.31]I get it.
[74:50.84]I get it.
[74:51.96]I get it.
[74:52.26]You're right.
[74:52.60]Yep.
[74:52.80]Yep.
[74:52.96]Yep.
[74:53.18]Okay.
[74:53.42]I understand.
[74:54.04]Because if they poop out something, it's... One of them's going to eat it.
[74:56.84]The same problem's going to happen again.
[74:58.44]Okay.
[74:58.78]I get it.
[75:00.26]Right.
[75:00.60]Right.
[75:00.76]Because they poop out the rock thing, and one of these guys will eat the rock thing, and then they'll turn into one of those things, and the whole thing happens all over again.
[75:07.45]Right.
[75:07.63]Okay.
[75:08.09]Okay.
[75:10.95]Stay away from these.
[75:19.08]We're good.
[75:20.20]I've got 250 bucks.
[75:21.46]Are these ready to be harvested?
[75:23.96]They are.
[75:25.88]I'm going to make two gardens, I think.
[75:27.12]Is that stupid?
[75:29.34]Is two garden plots a good idea?
[75:38.82]Garden.
[75:44.46]I'm doing beets.
[75:47.01]I'm a beet grower.
[75:50.67]Who's hungry?
[75:56.07]This dude's a beet freak.
[76:03.96]Nice!
[76:04.32]Alright, now activate my sucker.
[76:20.81]Sucker didn't get it all?
[76:26.30]Sucker.
[76:26.60]Now I can sell all this.
[76:34.66]Okay, so this is a tabby.
[76:36.26]So I could make some more tabbies.
[76:38.32]I could make tabbies and put a bunch of tabbies in here.
[76:40.16]Eventually, aren't they going to start getting out?
[76:48.74]Yeah, they'll bounce, right?
[76:53.38]Okay, so we're going to leave it as is now.
[76:54.58]I'm going to sell these daffodils.
[76:56.54]How much are you going to get for this?
[77:00.85]Ooh, 27 bucks a pop.
[77:05.77]400 bucks.
[77:11.10]Cool.
[77:14.78]Anybody have another quest?

[77:20.80]Ooh.
[77:22.58]Ooh.
[77:26.02]It's not very much money.
[77:29.94]It's not a whole lot.
[77:30.48]It's not very much money at all.
[77:32.32]Nine chickens, though.
[77:34.88]It'll be a good starter for a coop.
[77:37.42]Yeah, that's a bad deal.
[77:40.56]It's not a hard quest.
[77:41.80]No, I mean, it's not.
[77:44.12]Eh, should I just do it?
[77:45.10]I guess, yeah, let's do it.
[77:46.04]Here you go.
[77:49.15]What?
[77:49.77]What do I give it to you?
[77:51.11]What do I deliver you?
[78:00.03]Oh, they need to be little.
[78:00.81]They need to be little.
[78:03.69]I can't.
[78:04.71]You don't want adults?
[78:05.43]I don't know if you want.
[78:09.37]I thought maybe I could do adults.
[78:10.45]I don't know.
[78:15.96]Wait, the color matters?
[78:18.14]Oh.
[78:19.58]Wait, does that mean I can do this?
[78:20.48]It has to be the baby version.
[78:28.18]Alright, so I have to get the little baby.
[78:29.20]Alright, I can do that.
[78:29.97]I'll do it right now.
[78:30.53]Let's go.
[78:32.93]If this sinks in right now, it's a billion off the debt.
[78:35.15]If it doesn't sink in, then I will whistle.
[78:39.15]I'll take it.
[78:40.09]I'll do it.
[78:41.09]I'll take it.
[78:41.84]Thank you.
[78:47.54]No deal.

[79:07.99]Okay, I need to go get eight regular bunnies and eight regular rock monsters.
[79:13.03]Go.
[79:20.77]Eight little bunnies and eight...
[79:31.67]They're cats.
[79:32.15]I don't know.
[79:32.61]They look like they could be anything.
[79:34.19]Oh, shit.
[79:37.71]There we go.
[79:48.82]You know, it's the carrots.
[79:51.50]I keep seeing the carrots and I'm eating the carrots.
[79:57.50]No, don't eat that.

[80:23.09]I don't fucking care.
[80:24.31]I want the plorts.
[80:34.60]Get away from me, or I'm going to start swinging.
[80:36.43]I smell the plort.

[80:51.66]Okay, I need more tabby plorts.
[81:05.17]Damn, this game is fun.

[81:11.86]Go.
[81:13.56]Eight, eight, eight, eight, eight.
[81:15.16]Those things are cool, but I don't want them.
[81:16.36]Alright, I just need tabbies.
[81:17.64]I can... I also take them, right?
[81:33.48]I need more bunnies.
[81:34.18]They're not... I just... I keep thinking they're eating carrots.
[81:36.94]Get the chickens.
[81:45.76]No.
[81:49.70]They all eat carrots.
[81:51.64]It doesn't matter.
[81:52.34]Okay, think about this.
[81:54.67]In my brain, cat does not eat carrot.
[81:58.47]Like a kitty cat does not eat a carrot.
[82:04.54]It's his tiny brain I need more This brain Cats don't eat carrots they eat cat food and like fish Where I need more of these
[82:33.21]Cats eat carrots, you pothead.

[82:51.68]They do not eat carrots.
[82:53.95]Cats eat like gazelles.
[82:56.23]They don't eat carrots.
[83:00.23]Can I multiply these?
[83:05.57]How do I multiply a tabby?
[83:14.30]Can I somehow do something to multiply them?
[83:16.64]You can't.
[83:17.02]Who cares, Jerma?
[83:25.54]It's a game.
[83:28.50]I can't even read the chat.

[103:03.19]Okay, I got 30 of these.
[103:04.25]Let's say you switch... That's actually really important.
[103:10.23]Eye walls for the chickens.
[103:11.79]God damn it.
[103:16.07]Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that chickens just love to eat.
[103:18.72]Hence, we'll produce eggs.
[103:21.88]Do you guys make eggs?
[103:23.74]Well, you would have if you'd all had to get eaten alive.

[104:00.27]Jetpack.
[104:03.40]Okay.

[104:07.40]You just float around if you hold the space.
[104:09.00]Okay, cool.
[104:11.64]Still a harvester that I need to get.
[104:14.72]One.
[104:15.00]Ah, somebody ate that.

[110:35.41]I was like, oh god, what am I looking at?
[110:41.08]EP.
[110:56.01]Alright, let's get back to it.
[110:56.91]Oh.
[110:59.99]I hated that game.
[111:04.82]I'm just kidding.
[111:05.62]I'm kidding.
[111:06.14]I liked it.
[111:14.43]We'll catch the... Oh, there we go.

[111:36.31]Remember the DMT robot?
[111:43.25]Very, very cool.
[111:45.39]That's trippy too.
[111:46.21]Catch that when we get back.
[111:50.62]Don't ever stop doing that.
[111:51.68]It's funny.
[111:53.42]Yeah, it's funny for like the... It's funny for us.
[111:56.22]But it's not funny for somebody that comes in and is just like, that's mean and I like Pikmin.
[112:01.72]Whatever.
[112:02.26]I ain't gonna stop.
[112:04.16]Sorry.
[112:04.44]Alright, so what was I doing?
[112:06.64]I was... What was I doing?
[112:14.23]Just look at how many... I was gonna say... I gotta give this a better name.
[112:23.95]Alright, I need 14 Pogfruits and 4 Strawberry Cheesecakes.

[113:05.12]Allow me to introduce the huge emails.
[113:08.29]Where's the TL;DR?
[113:11.53]TL;DR.
[113:14.07]Fruits and vegetables give you plus 10% extra health.
[113:22.33]My pet cactus.
[113:27.84]You know I kill every plant I touch, but I promise you this one will last.
[113:30.39]I mean, if it can't keep a cactus alive, then clearly something's wrong.
[113:32.73]When I look at it, I think of you out there on the range, doing your thing.
[113:36.99]Hope you're okay.
[113:41.47]It's time to just switch on permanent D&D.
[113:43.46]Did I sleep?
[113:46.96]Alright, I'm on my way.

[115:22.13]Alright, here he is.
[115:24.29]Hen hen.

[125:35.97]I know how much you hate puzzly puzzles, and I know how much debt you're in.
[125:42.00]Well, Jeremy, this is your test.
[125:57.23]Well, I don't have a Rubik's Cube
[126:25.20]Hey, Saw!

[126:40.52]Are you sure?
[126:44.42]No, I don't see one anywhere, man.
[126:47.70]I'm certain there's a Rubik's Cube in there somewhere.
[126:50.56]Maybe it fell under the chair.
[126:53.23]It's not under the fucking chair.
[126:54.69]There's nothing- I'm standing.
[126:56.97]There's no chair in there.
[126:57.75]There's no chair in there.
[127:00.67]I don't- I have no idea where it is.
[127:01.93]I have no idea where it is.
[127:04.75]He doesn't- He doesn't think it's gonna make a person die.

[127:12.03]Chaos.
[127:12.73]Chaos.
[127:14.23]It doesn't sound like Saw at all.
[127:16.65]It doesn't- Hold on.
[127:17.91]Chaos.
[127:19.13]Chaos.
[127:20.13]What the fuck is wrong with him?
[127:21.74]Why does he sound like that?
[127:23.86]His voice changer is so fucked up.
[127:26.78]He's sitting there going like this.
[127:31.60]Can I leave the room?
[127:50.25]I can hear you.
[127:50.71]You've done that bit like a thousand times by now.
[127:52.74]And I read Saw II's script.
[127:53.86]And it sucked.
[128:19.26]I mean, it sucked.
[128:20.50]Sawtooth.
[128:21.54]By far the best in the series.
[128:24.84]Fine.
[128:25.60]If there's no Rubik's Cube there, then let me ask you this one question.
[128:29.36]What's the question?
[128:33.40]That was my stomach.
[128:35.41]What do you think I should have for dinner tonight?
[128:39.99]If you get what my favorite food's wrong, gas is gonna fill the room.
[128:43.53]Well, then, gas.
[128:44.79]Gas.
[128:45.17]Gas.
[128:45.65]Gas will fill it.
[128:48.11]Make your choice.
[128:49.32]Please, say pizza.
[128:52.58]Um... Well, pizza's not really that good for you.
[128:56.96]How about tacos?
[128:58.92]Saw doesn't like tacos.
[129:00.90]Too messy.
[129:02.22]Can't eat them in the car.
[129:04.72]You're eating food in the car?
[129:06.46]Yes.
[129:06.76]I eat food in the car all the time.
[129:08.93]That doesn't sound like a smart, safe thing to do.
[129:13.93]Pizza's really easy to eat in the car.
[129:16.15]You ever have pizza in the car?
[129:17.96]Am I gonna get any of this money, by the way?
[129:20.17]Because the Rubik's Cube... Nah, just forget about all that.
[129:23.83]Nothing happens at the end.
[129:25.89]This is just to scare the shit out of people.
[129:27.75]So to do my fucked up tasks.
[129:29.45]Nobody actually has to do any of this stuff.
[129:31.41]The door is open.
[129:33.01]It leads out to the outside.
[129:34.43]You can actually walk out right now.
[129:37.40]See the exit sign over there?
[129:39.88]Yeah, I do.
[129:40.48]You can just walk out if you want.
[129:43.02]When this goes to zero, nothing happens.
[129:46.29]So I can just leave.
[129:47.57]Yeah.
[129:47.71]Alright.
[129:48.41]Well, I'm just going to leave.
[129:50.66]That was like kind of fun.
[129:51.92]I guess like, I don't know.
[129:52.52]You like, you like kidnapped me and like took me.
[129:55.16]Yeah, I did.
[129:56.24]And I, you know, I probably, I'm probably going to jail for all that.
[129:59.54]Cause I just keep like, you know, kidnapping people and putting them in these chairs.
[130:03.65]But, uh, you just, you still didn't say what you, what I was going to eat.
[130:06.95]I'm going to say, um, you know what?
[130:10.53]Here, I'm going to say pizza.
[130:12.75]Pizza, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[130:18.31]You really like saying that, don't you?
[130:19.63]No saying that word.
[130:20.69]It's my favorite.
[130:24.69]Alright, I got to go.
[130:25.87]There's two other people.
[130:26.75]There's a guy with a thing on his jaw in one of the other rooms.
[130:30.09]There's a lady trapped in a big spider web and a giant spider.
[130:33.92]It was really hard to find a giant spider.
[130:35.54]It was very difficult.
[130:37.40]I'm going to eat her if she doesn't repent the insurance fraud that she had or something.
[130:43.03]Okay.
[130:44.53]Well, I'll talk to you later.
[130:45.39]I'm going to get up and leave.
[130:46.97]See you later.
[130:47.43]It was good to see you again.
[130:54.60]This door, that door back there?
[130:56.24]Yeah, no, behind you, behind you.
[130:57.52]Turn around.
[130:58.02]You're up there.
[130:59.53]Alright.
[130:59.77]See you later.
[131:14.29]This door's locked.
[131:16.95]That one's locked?
[131:18.77]Yeah, this one's locked.
[131:19.70]I can't get out of that one.
[131:20.98]They're all supposed to be unlocked.
[131:22.06]I'm not sure.
[131:22.44]I don't know what happened.
[131:25.00]Uh, you didn't code that.
[131:27.40]You didn't code this correctly, I don't think.
[131:29.76]Yeah, yeah.
[131:30.12]All I know how to do is have the number count down.
[131:31.92]I didn't know how I got the zero to stop.
[131:34.20]Thank God Bill Gates figured out Y2K because then we would have gone back in time like minus 50,000 years if he didn't figure that out.
[131:41.61]I have no idea what the hell I was doing.
[131:45.15]So are you saying that if I let this run, then this is debt that is removed?
[131:52.48]Because I'm removing debt now.
[131:58.01]Well, you know, I didn't really think about that.
[132:00.71]But now that you think about it, this is debt being added, actually.
[132:04.77]Is debt being added?
[132:06.27]Right.
[132:06.75]Okay.
[132:07.17]That makes complete sense.
[132:08.38]Thank you, Saw.
[132:09.12]This was a lot of fun.
[132:10.24]Wait, what's happening?
[132:13.72]Why is it taking up?
[132:14.82]I kind of want to leave this.
[132:20.62]What happens when it gets to like a hundred million?
[132:25.23]Is my computer going to crash?
[132:30.93]Just put it in the corner.
[132:32.11]Alright, I'm just going to put this in the corner.
[132:36.91]I'm going to put the music.
[132:38.21]I can't just have the music going.
[132:41.89]I have to mute the website.
[132:46.12]Let me mute this.
[132:47.00]Okay.
[132:56.00]I'm curious to see what happens to this.
[133:00.85]Can I like... Alright, hold on.
[133:01.95]Let me make sure I can... Okay.
[133:09.15]This is good?
[133:09.71]I'm not going to turn this off.
[133:25.63]I am not turning this off, by the way, until the stream turns off.
[133:28.86]Just to make sure everybody knows that.
[133:31.40]Although, maybe I should just, maybe we'll check on it.
[133:33.34]I don't want that to be counting the whole time.
[133:36.84]We're going to check on this every so often.
[133:42.04]We'll give it a good look every so often, okay?
[133:50.04]Yeah, we'll give it a look.
[133:51.69]I can just open it like that.
[133:52.57]Yeah, we're good.
[133:54.16]Keep it there.
[133:54.66]No, I don't want to, like, ruin... I don't want to ruin the entire, like, VOD or the editing that the editors... No, I can't just sit there the whole time.
[134:07.32]You know how many people are going to ask a question about that on this stream?
[134:11.02]Hey, why does this dude have just a negative counter going?
[134:16.90]And we have to explain it to them every time.
[134:21.39]Alright, I'm gonna leave it there until a million.
[134:22.97]We'll see what happens at one million.
[134:33.16]There it is.
[134:33.54]Why does this dude have a negative counter?
[134:35.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[134:38.52]Alright, let's go.
[134:42.98]Gas, we're full of gas.
[134:48.68]Alright, now I'm going to go to bed so I can get up in the morning and... Cool.
[134:55.90]Good.
[134:56.82]Stop doing that.
[134:57.76]Stop doing that.
[134:58.64]Stop doing that.
[135:00.10]I'm 35.
[135:00.62]You can't act like that.
[135:01.26]Okay.
[135:02.72]You have volume.
[135:05.78]Here we go.
[135:19.93]Okay, I'm gonna go to sleep.
[135:20.85]The best part about that, I love this clip, that like, not clip, this site.
[135:26.75]Because it was, whoever made that, I love you.
[135:31.04]You're fucking incredible.
[135:32.32]Because you just assumed that I had a Rubik's Cube on my desk.
[135:38.59]That's so funny.
[135:46.40]The counter just starts going.
[135:48.52]Let me tell you right now, I would not have been able to do it in that amount of time.
[135:52.80]It would probably take me a few days to do a Rubik's Cube.
[135:54.81]And that's really embarrassing to say, but it's the truth.
[135:58.17]I would do it a little bit, get frustrated, and then stop.
[136:02.09]And then a day later, pick it up.
[136:09.55]That's a potential week or two long project.
[136:12.09]Alright, let's do the stock market.
[136:16.87]It went down even more.
[136:17.85]I need money.
[136:25.46]I don't care.
[136:30.70]I need the money.
[136:31.30]I need to upgrade.
[136:32.16]Hold it.
[136:32.36]Hold.
[136:32.54]No.
[136:32.66]I'm not going to hold it.
[136:52.16]Oh, what am I doing?
[136:52.66]Just hit the button.
[136:54.34]Ooh, strawberries.
[136:55.04]Nice.
[136:56.07]I might actually be able to do this right now.
[136:57.99]I got five.
[136:58.45]I can do it.
[136:59.55]Holy shit.
[136:59.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[137:00.53]Get this right.
[137:00.89]This is so many Q-Birds.
[137:04.09]This is insane.
[137:06.53]Four, 15 Q-Birds.
[137:07.94]Nice.
[137:08.22]Alright.
[137:08.60]Hold on.
[137:12.64]Four.
[137:12.84]I need a little bit.
[137:13.42]Oh, that's good.
[137:14.00]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[137:17.04]Um, I need some more pogs.
[137:24.15]Fuck.
[137:27.25]Cool.
[137:28.77]Nice.
[137:29.03]Alright.
[137:29.37]Alright.
[137:29.61]Alright.
[137:29.81]Alright.
[137:30.05]Store these.
[137:33.86]What are the chickens doing?
[137:38.58]Oh, they grew up.
[137:39.20]Nice.
[137:39.48]Alright.
[137:39.84]I need a rooster.
[137:42.80]And a couple more fruits.
[137:46.89]So we're gonna rooster run.
[137:48.45]Alright, I got four minutes to do this.
[137:49.59]I just need some pogs.
[137:55.15]This tree up here I know for a fact has them.
[138:00.22]I know for a fact.
[138:00.94]Chickens.
[138:04.70]Excuse me.
[138:09.30]Chickens.
[138:10.12]Cool.
[138:10.48]Cool.
[138:12.42]Another chicken.
[138:13.26]Cool.
[138:14.12]Chicken.
[138:14.62]Cool.
[138:18.23]Hey Lenny the person, thanks for the 20 community subs.
[138:28.26]Right there, there we are.
[138:31.84]Fly up there.
[138:32.42]I'm running out.
[138:36.26]Check in!
[138:36.48]Give me these.
[138:42.17]Touch these, get away from this.
[138:44.85]That should be enough.
[138:45.73]Alright, get out.
[138:50.08]Coffee?
[138:50.86]Oh.
[138:52.86]Coffee.
[138:56.16]Coffee.
[138:58.58]I'll do it.
[138:58.94]I'll do the line.
[138:59.66]Fine.
[138:59.96]I'll do it.
[139:00.35]I'll do it.
[139:00.71]I'll do it.
[139:02.37]Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[139:04.11]There you go.
[139:06.61]He did it.
[139:07.01]I'll do it again.
[139:07.65]I'll do it authentic.
[139:09.85]Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[139:11.43]There you go.
[139:12.53]That's exactly how everybody wanted me to say that.
[139:16.47]I get a rooster for this.
[139:22.73]Didn't do it right.
[139:23.53]Didn't do it right.
[139:29.64]Bingo.
[139:35.58]I'll get a rooster in there.
[139:38.04]Now we're going to have eggs.
[139:42.87]Very nice.
[139:43.29]Oh, was that an egg?
[139:45.47]Awesome.
[139:51.13]Now I have plenty of chickens.
[139:54.40]I upgrade this a little more.
[139:55.12]I got 1200 bucks.
[139:55.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[139:58.71]Everybody's hungry.
[139:59.85]Alright, I'm going to relax.
[140:02.01]Settle down.
[140:03.29]Uh, feed.
[140:04.35]Let's feed them.
[140:05.85]No, we got much better than pog fruit, but whatever.
[140:09.91]Let's just use it.
[140:20.80]Now we're cooking for gash.
[140:26.73]Suck it up.
[140:29.13]I need a sucker on here.
[140:31.85]I'm getting real sick of having to do that.
[140:33.59]Even if it's 500 bucks, I don't care.
[140:35.52]I want a sucker on this one.
[140:50.36]What do we got?
[140:51.25]Four and six.
[140:52.41]Do it again.
[140:53.39]Suck it up.
[140:59.23]Okay, eat one of these.
[141:03.56]Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.
[141:05.82]Thanks for the doy.
[141:09.50]Alright.
[141:16.17]Prices are still down.
[141:20.15]Time for upgrades.
[141:25.53]Upgrade.
[141:26.89]304.
[141:26.91]I sort of held on to the gold.
[141:31.11]It's a million.
[141:32.37]Oh, yeah, that's still there.
[141:33.23]Okay, let me take out.
[141:43.55]No, I'll leave that in.
[141:45.14]What can I do here for the chickens?
[141:47.58]Spring grass, Vitamizer.
[141:51.18]Vitamizer baits the chickens in Vita rays, allowing them to grow into healthy hens and roosters twice as fast.
[141:56.48]Spring grass attracts scuttlebugs that they eat.
[141:59.50]They'll produce eggs twice as fast.
[142:01.16]So we want the grass.
[142:03.46]Get them both.
[142:05.92]Let's go.
[142:06.26]Okay, so now... This is a pretty good, uh... This is going pretty good.
[142:13.32]Now I'm gonna take, like, seven of them to feed to the big cat.
[142:19.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[142:25.21]Grass.
[142:25.99]Grass.
[142:30.71]When did this game come out?
[142:31.73]What year?
[142:36.90]What year did this game come out?
[142:37.70]2000... 2017.
[142:42.96]Okay. 2017?
[142:50.53]What was my game of the year in 2017?
[142:51.45]Can I amend it?
[142:54.77]What was my game of the year in 2017?
[142:55.93]Anyone know?
[143:03.03]2016.
[143:03.19]What was my game of the year in 2016?
[143:05.89]I don't know.
[143:06.27]It was Sorcery.
[143:16.92]It was The Witcher 3.
[143:17.60]Oh yeah.
[143:18.48]Was that 2015?
[143:18.80]No, I don't think that was 2015.
[143:26.23]All Out 4 Omega Lull.
[143:27.77]Now that's a huge Omega Lull.
[143:28.99]That's like a mega Omega Lull.
[143:31.84]That's the biggest Omega Lull I've ever heard in my life.
[143:35.44]Alright, I'm taking some of you.
[143:42.89]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm taking this big supply.
[143:45.97]We're gonna go feed the big guy.
[143:47.77]And I'm gonna get a quest.
[143:49.71]I need these plorts post haste, whatever that means.
[143:54.02]Ooh!
[143:55.00]Ooh!
[143:55.28]That's... Holy shit, this is a rip-off for you.
[143:58.12]This is the... What a rip-off!
[143:59.86]This is the easiest... Oh my god!
[144:01.44]That's the simplest thing ever.
[144:02.44]Okay.
[144:09.40]What about... How many do I need?
[144:10.24]I need just pink and... I have those already.
[144:15.90]Let's scam this person.
[144:31.72]Okay, now let's get pink plorts.

[145:06.72]That was the easiest.
[145:08.09]A huge amount of money.
[145:09.53]It was very simple.
[145:10.31]I didn't have to do anything.
[145:12.99]Perfect.
[145:19.33]Plorts?
[145:20.61]Plorts?
[145:21.23]Okay.
[145:23.02]And what do I get for this?
[145:23.66]Alright, I gotta clear my inventory.
[145:25.90]Um... Eat some of these beets.
[145:28.36]Just leave them in there.
[145:28.86]You guys will be hungry eventually.
[145:29.92]Okay.
[145:31.85]Um... Give me these.
[145:34.19]Okay.
[145:40.75]Cool.
[145:42.47]Sell a bunch of shit.
[145:46.14]Prices?
[145:47.12]Still bad.

[146:04.46]Oh, I love just vacuuming everything.
[146:06.08]This is the best game ever.
[146:09.16]This might be the best game ever.
[146:12.70]I know a lot of you have, you know, like Mario Galaxy is like your number one game ever made.
[146:17.89]No, no, no, it's not.

[146:21.97]It's this game.

[148:19.24]It's distracting.
[148:35.48]I can't believe I found a golden at the very beginning.

[149:56.94]Well, I guess I can't do it.
[150:01.83]Yeah, I was going to bring the stony back.
[150:03.31]And I'm going to take another quest.
[150:07.51]Yeah, try that again.
[150:12.60]See what happens.
[150:22.14]Sell, sell, sell, sell.
[150:23.62]Money, money, money, money.
[150:30.82]Money.
[150:31.79]I'll take money.
[150:32.75]Thanks for the money.
[150:35.93]This dude is so greedy.
[150:43.88]Yes, I am.
[150:46.42]Get over it.
[150:56.28]Come on, I want more.
[150:57.96]I'm not satisfied with the amount of money that I'm going to bring back.
[150:59.98]Alright, fine.
[151:00.38]Goodbye.
[151:11.99]A greedy Grinner.
[151:12.81]Anything else here?
[151:23.02]I'll take it.
[151:24.90]I'll take it.
[151:26.52]Okay.
[151:31.60]You unhinged?
[151:32.88]Are you asking me or did you say I was?
[151:34.34]Hey, dude, you unhinged?
[151:44.37]Yeah.
[151:46.19]I think so.
[151:46.87]Yep.
[151:52.30]Yep.
[152:00.93]That's Q. He didn't do anything.
[152:03.12]We just crossed 2 million, by the way.
[152:05.76]Negative 2 million.
[152:10.76]There are a lot of people in here now.
[152:13.90]It's clocking away.
[152:14.83]No more quests.
[152:20.59]Time to sell.
[152:21.11]Actually, I'm going to go sleep.
[152:22.87]Maybe the market will be better in the morning.
[152:24.13]Alright, market.
[152:25.70]I'm going to wake up to a better market.
[152:34.83]That's as much as I can get it.
[152:43.07]Well, it seems like another wannabe rancher has signed up for a loaning existence on a faraway space rock.
[152:46.77]Congrats, Beatrix.
[152:49.39]I'm Mochi Miles.
[152:50.91]That's Miles as in Tatsuya Miles, the billionaire.
[152:53.95]I'm here to do important business for my dad, but that doesn't mean I won't make all the rest of these backwater types out here look bad in the process.
[153:01.12]No one conquers the plort market like I do, day in and day out.
[153:05.14]My dad gives me the inside track, so I look forward to my requesting plorts that I know I will make me huge profits later on.
[153:11.76]So I wish you the best of luck, Beatrix.
[153:13.78]Maybe you'll even reach second place one day.
[153:16.30]At the very least, you can tell your friends that you helped out the great Mochi Miles in her conquest of the Far, Far Range.
[153:22.89]Later, Tater.
[153:24.01]Mochi Miles, Top Rancher.
[153:33.27]Now go to sleep.
[153:42.25]Hank Booster MK2.
[153:43.29]Ooh!
[153:50.94]Yeah!
[153:54.60]Yeah!
[153:56.94]Yeah!
[154:01.40]Market is done.
[154:03.44]What?
[154:21.00]You keep selling.
[154:21.96]Yeah, because it's fucking money.
[154:27.35]I need some more chickens to feed to the big guy.
[154:28.95]Not the stony one, because that's a rare one.
[154:30.45]I want that one.
[154:36.07]Are we about to wipe out this entire group?
[154:41.37]I have 14.
[154:42.23]Alright.
[154:44.07]15 hens.
[154:44.53]Is that not going to be enough?
[154:55.03]Oh, they're really hungry.
[154:55.96]Alright.

[155:27.37]Alright, you guys want cute berries?
[155:29.05]We love cute berries.
[155:39.85]Eat up.
[155:48.31]Ooh, the kiwberries are a pretty good food, aren't they?
[155:59.50]Poison the water.
[156:00.20]I need to relax, dude.
[156:02.46]I'm going to have to put a ceiling on.
[156:09.99]Ow, hey.
[156:11.95]I'm about to throw him over the edge.

[157:05.47]Take over there, punch him in the face and then kill him.
[157:08.43]What's it from?
[157:11.65]What is that from?
[157:20.97]No, that's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[157:26.26]That's the judge.
[157:28.28]He says like, and then kill him.
[157:41.01]If you say so.
[157:41.67]No, I know so.
[157:49.84]I want to sell these when the rock plorts are higher, but whatever.
[157:55.49]I want to upgrade now.
[157:59.31]Put them in the dip.
[158:00.23]Not the dip!
[158:02.59]We can't go into the dip!
[158:04.55]No!
[158:08.11]Take them over to the dip.
[158:08.88]Jump his head in, dunk his head over, then kill him.

[166:44.89]It's so good.
[166:52.85]If I'm not playing, if I'm not doing the best possible route, I'm taking a slow.
[166:58.29]I want to do that.
[167:04.56]I want to just do dumb things like this.
[167:06.86]Because guess what?
[167:07.78]In like six months when I'm the number one slime rancher player on the leaderboards, I would like you to come back and then we'll grade your performance in the video game.

[167:55.10]Someone from the chat wrote the chicken email.
[167:57.00]Hahaha.
[168:04.39]Alright, I want to save up for the new area.
[168:05.77]So we're going to do a quest.
[168:12.61]I really want to get that.
[168:16.85]Just so you can see.
[168:18.09]When it hits a billion, I wonder what's going to happen.
[168:29.30]Alright.
[168:31.66]That's fine.
[168:33.68]Everyone's been fed.
[168:34.38]These are just worthless, whatever.
[168:38.19]Okay, cool.
[168:45.77]I need, what is it, 1,700 to go to the next area?
[168:52.51]This is Ranch Expansion.
[168:54.23]The Grotto is 1,795.
[168:55.03]What's the other one?
[168:57.29]I need to go to the Grotto.
[169:04.53]Or... The Overgrowth.
[169:08.59]Which one?
[169:09.43]What's better?
[169:09.79]I'm sure they're both fun.
[169:13.39]Which one's more... Grotto?
[169:17.87]Those are extra areas for farming.
[169:19.35]That's cool.
[169:21.87]I personally like the Grotto more.
[169:23.32]Okay.
[169:24.20]Overgrowth gives food.
[169:26.57]We'll go to Grotto.
[169:28.33]Grotto sounds like fun.
[169:30.89]I don't need to do any of that.
[169:31.89]This is all good to go.
[169:32.79]We'll do a feeding.
[169:35.25]We'll do a collection.
[169:35.93]We'll do a selling.
[169:36.63]And then I'm going to go do a quest.
[169:51.05]Chicken.
[169:51.51]Chicken.
[169:54.34]Oh, fuck.
[169:58.51]It was that guy, okay.
[170:04.53]Oh, wrong.
[170:08.28]How many do I need?
[170:15.12]Eight?
[170:17.62]Eight chickens and one rooster.
[170:34.01]Am I gonna just wipe out this population?
[170:36.08]There's no more red chickens.
[170:44.76]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[170:49.10]Okay, I got it.
[170:49.64]That came out of nowhere.
[171:10.37]I'm wiping out this whole population.
[171:12.70]No, I need to grow, have people grow up first.
[171:16.72]You guys just keep having chickens, go on.
[171:18.22]Okay, here we go.
[171:25.41]Let's feed, collect, sell, and then I'm gonna go find some chickens.
[171:37.17]I'm feeding you, I got you, I got you.
[171:51.00]Oh no, it's clogged.
[171:51.68]Get in there.
[172:01.51]You guys good?
[172:02.31]Who's eating?
[172:02.71]Eat.
[172:03.69]Alright, you'll eat.
[172:08.73]Keep eating.
[172:09.19]Go on.
[172:09.61]Go on.
[172:09.95]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[172:14.43]If you have too many chickens in the pen, they won't have Zex.
[172:16.50]Okay.
[172:17.30]Is that a real thing?
[172:18.30]Because that's good to know.
[172:28.76]Okay, we just have stony hens left, but whatever.
[172:39.36]I can replenish that population.
[172:40.57]Nice.
[172:44.59]That's a lot of money.
[172:58.86]and a lot of pog fruit too alright I'm gonna store the pog fruit because somebody usually randomly just wants it tell these what's we got in here sell this too I'm not gonna make I'm just not gonna make them maybe I will eventually but not right now
[173:24.77]Is that shit up?
[173:30.30]I have enough.
[173:35.98]Alright, cool.
[173:36.64]I can buy the new... We're going to buy Grotto.
[173:44.62]No, wrong.
[173:51.32]I need to buy a couple more plots too.
[173:57.42]Got it.
[173:58.64]A grotto.
[173:59.52]Oh, I'm so excited.
[174:00.28]Then what's over here?
[174:09.21]Before I left the ranch, I found myself sleeping most nights in this here grotto.
[174:13.25]I'd fill it full of phosphor slimes and watch them dance in the dark.
[174:17.01]Drifting off, I'd pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars across the limitless black of space.
[174:22.34]It's funny how when you dream, you sure become a sucker for the impossible.
[174:26.22]Every time I woke to find myself back in the grotto, I'd feel a little sadness.
[174:30.41]But then it was back to work.
[174:32.73]There was always something that needed doing.
[174:36.39]Oh, it's just extra space.
[174:38.21]Alright, I get it.
[174:40.57]Oh, shit.
[174:40.99]Okay, this is just a bunch of more plots.
[174:42.65]I get it.
[174:42.91]Okay.
[174:47.08]That was funny?
[174:47.68]I wasn't trying to be funny.
[174:50.02]What'd you do?
[174:57.26]Well, let's just make a... Okay, I got a new... I got one of these.
[175:02.07]So there are certain slimes that only want to be at night, right?
[175:08.99]So let's put the night slimes in there.
[175:10.75]Pond.
[175:23.16]Make a pond?
[175:30.50]Fresh water on the ranch.
[175:31.66]Oh.
[175:36.39]Turtle slime, eh.
[175:43.59]How do I go back?
[175:48.08]How do I get out of here?
[175:49.66]Oh, okay.
[176:00.36]Happy Valentine's Day?
[176:01.48]Oh, that's right.
[176:02.04]It is Valentine's Day, like, soon, isn't it?

[185:38.51]It's time to sell them.
[185:47.23]I'm going to start expanding how many people I have.

[187:19.31]Look at all these new chickens.
[187:40.69]This is maxed out.
[187:42.83]I am going to go on an expedition here, and I'm going to go get a bunch of new slimes.
[187:49.67]And they're going to go up here.
[187:50.62]Take a look at this.
[187:53.46]Bang.
[187:55.42]And... Boom.
[187:58.60]And... Boink.
[188:02.60]I want a new slime in here.
[188:06.62]Let's go get one.
[188:12.30]I need the rock slimes.
[188:13.10]You're right.
[188:14.20]I'll get those too.
[188:19.06]This time, I'm going to go get rocks.
[188:21.96]See if we can make, like, blue or something.
[188:24.44]I'll definitely take these chickens.
[188:25.40]Why the hell not?
[188:25.96]Okay.
[188:36.61]You can use a jetpack to get to the... I'm going over here.
[188:39.99]What is this place?
[188:47.86]He's a big guy.
[188:49.08]What does he want?
[188:52.44]He wants... Mushrooms.
[188:55.57]Ooh, what's this?
[188:55.95]There's a shitload of chickens in there.
[189:01.97]Alright, cool.
[189:02.85]Do you want chickens?
[189:05.47]You eat chickens.
[189:07.68]Just like the other one.

[189:18.17]It's Blarkey.
[189:18.89]Visit the ranch house to manage secret styles.
[189:21.93]Cool.
[189:29.90]He eats anything.
[189:30.66]Alright, so I'm just going to load him up with cheap fruits.
[189:32.84]He should add some of his own slime, to be honest.
[189:44.45]Not that he has anything else to do.
[189:55.15]I think, do I want a cat?
[189:57.74]What about a rock cat?
[190:01.96]What about a rock cat?
[190:04.36]Would that be cool?
[190:10.40]It would be a blue rock cat, right?
[190:11.78]Come here.
[190:19.57]That would be epic.
[190:22.15]I'll try it.
[190:23.59]What if I do a flying cat?
[190:28.33]I'm going to experiment.
[190:39.96]I'm going to do experimentation.
[190:48.82]Oh!

[191:46.54]Do I even have that open?
[191:54.09]Is this a teleporter?
[191:57.33]Oh my god, hell yeah.
[192:00.45]Wait, where am I?
[192:01.09]The dock's 5,000.
[192:07.29]Where am I?
[192:07.91]Wait, where am I?
[192:13.36]What's going on?
[192:18.10]What?
[192:33.08]How do we get out of here?
[192:33.62]This is a new area?
[192:44.60]You haven't unlocked that area.
[192:46.02]Oh.
[192:47.37]I can teleport into it, but I can't.
[192:48.97]Okay, whatever.
[192:49.37]Alright.
[192:50.85]Alright.
[192:51.07]I fed that guy.
[192:51.67]He's done.
[192:53.45]How much money do I get for that?
[192:56.65]I got... It's sequence broke.
[192:57.87]Oh, well.
[193:04.03]I have a bunch of cats.
[193:04.99]I want to go back and do some experimentation.
[193:06.46]I don't need this.
[193:11.32]Get rid of it.
[193:20.03]Alright, so that's what that does.
[193:23.03]Now, if... Hmm.
[193:24.85]Hmm.
[193:31.84]I could do rock cats.
[193:33.46]Blue rock cats.
[193:40.46]I could have two different kinds of cats.
[193:47.67]You already have rocks and cats.
[193:49.19]Yes, but I don't have rock cats.
[194:00.34]I have cats.
[194:01.06]I have rocks.
[194:01.72]I don't have rock cats.
[194:18.07]Cool.
[194:19.87]He likes veggies and meat.
[194:24.26]Make flying cats.
[194:27.42]Fly cat is more useful.
[194:30.10]Just was checking.
[194:32.70]I think I sold all the flying ones.
[194:36.70]Did I sell all the flying ones?
[194:37.70]I think I did.
[194:38.14]What does this do?
[194:39.90]What does this do?
[194:43.62]How do I use it?
[194:49.70]A decoration?
[194:50.34]Just put it down?
[194:53.94]Oh.
[195:04.86]Wow.

[195:30.29]No.
[195:34.85]This one's different.
[195:36.57]What is that one?
[195:40.11]Elder hen.
[195:40.91]An old bird whose egg-laying days are over.
[195:43.73]How many does he want?
[196:00.66]I need four more of those.
[196:06.40]On to... Shit.
[196:19.01]Wait, what?
[196:32.58]Why?

[196:43.13]I respect that hen.
[196:44.61]Very much.
[196:45.03]Did a lot of good work and was a wonderful, wonderful bird.
[196:51.54]But they eat them.
[196:54.00]But they eat them.
[196:55.38]What the hell was that?
[196:57.20]But they eat them.
[197:01.80]That was like a three-year-old explaining to you why they ate crayons.
[197:09.86]Did you eat the box of crayons?
[197:11.78]Yes, but that's a cycle.
[197:15.62]I like blue, so I eat them.
[197:18.73]I ran out of pink, so I eat blue.
[197:23.77]Okay.
[197:24.85]I like eating blue crayons.
[197:26.23]That's why I do it.
[197:27.01]That's a cycle of life.
[197:34.35]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[197:44.19]Fill up.
[197:49.61]Hello.

[198:18.19]You poop.
[198:19.05]Wow.
[198:21.57]That's a lot.
[198:25.93]That's actually a lot.

[198:36.72]Captain.
[198:39.64]Captain.
[198:41.49]I'm sorry.
[198:42.03]How many more do you want?
[198:44.41]You need a few more of these.
[198:45.77]Two more.
[198:48.89]Two more just regular hens.
[198:50.55]I'll go grab them.
[198:59.64]Make an auto feeder.
[199:00.48]I will.
[199:06.76]I need... What the hell?
[199:08.13]What am I looking for?
[199:08.65]What am I doing out here?

[225:14.23]That's a jetpack?
[225:14.81]Yeah, the jetpack sucks.
[225:16.93]You just float in the air.
[225:18.03]You don't actually fly up.

[227:11.35]Water is its own slot.
[227:12.65]Yeah, what are you guys on about?
[227:20.03]Yeah, water is its own slot in the inventory.

[303:32.65]Let's take a look.
[303:41.26]So this says, sorry.
[303:51.43]This has just been playing the whole time, the entire stream.
[303:56.09]It's been playing the entire stream at like 0% volume.
[304:00.40]Let's see.
[304:01.06]Let's get the apology.
[304:02.54]Let's get the apology.
[304:06.91]Very sorry about the last trap.
[304:20.84]What?
[304:32.22]For 500 million off your debt, you can solve the room excuse and free yourself from my lair.
[304:37.98]However, the longer you take, the less money you'll get.
[304:41.56]Will you solve the room excuse in time?
[304:44.38]Will you be trapped here forever, left spinning the cube for eternity while your debt climbs higher and higher?
[304:51.26]The clock is ticking, Jeremy.
[304:52.82]Make your choice.
[304:56.58]Wait, it works?
[304:58.54]Wait, what?
[304:59.61]How do I get it?
[305:02.82]Oh, it doesn't work.
[305:07.22]Are you shitting me?
[305:09.38]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[305:16.85]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[305:36.19]Fuck.
[305:39.59]I gotta get one side correct.
[305:41.29]I gotta get one side.
[305:48.14]Guys, I have no fucking idea how to do a Rubik's Cube.
[305:51.86]I have absolutely no idea.
[305:56.25]I've only picked him up and just mushed him around in my hands for two minutes.
[306:00.45]I don't even know how it works.
[306:02.35]I don't understand how it works.
[306:05.08]You have to get the colors on the right side, but I don't know how to do that.
[306:11.99]I don't know the mechanics.
[306:17.49]I think I got it.
[306:18.25]Hold on, I almost got orange.
[306:20.65]Wait, hold on.
[306:21.15]The clock is ticking.
[306:24.63]I know.
[306:25.41]I'm trying to get this done.
[306:28.45]Where's orange?
[306:31.09]Orange is here, okay.
[306:34.39]I gotta try to get- what has the most- what has the most things on the side?
[306:36.91]What has the most things- what has the most things on the side?
[306:40.57]What has the- I don't know what- what side has the most color on it?
[306:50.88]I'm not gonna be able to do this shit.
[306:54.14]Hold on, whiz- white?
[306:57.00]Wait.
[306:58.05]Hold on a second.
[307:11.10]God damn it.
[307:11.94]Hold on.
[307:17.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[307:21.67]Why is it nice music?
[307:24.39]Why is this like an acoustic guitar?
[307:26.45]I feel like I'm in a college dorm room and someone's about to start singing.
[307:29.80]Oh, here it comes.
[307:37.66]It's Sly Rancher.
[307:40.08]Wait, I can turn the cube too.
[307:42.00]Holy shit.
[307:42.84]This is amazing.
[307:44.16]Wait.
[307:54.45]There's extra colors.
[307:55.83]Holy fuck.
[307:58.11]I'm almost getting there.
[308:05.62]I don't get it.
[308:06.66]I never did.
[308:07.44]I should have paid attention in school.
[308:09.59]That's something.
[308:12.07]I shouldn't have paid attention in school.
[308:13.65]I didn't pay any attention in school.
[308:22.98]And then... Rubik's Cube.
[308:38.00]We have like seven hours to do this.
[308:39.62]I have so long.
[308:47.09]I have such a long time.
[308:48.55]I have an insanely long time.
[308:57.07]Wait, what over here?
[309:07.67]fuck I don't know what to do I I don't even if I look it up jigsaw is very patient yeah apparently you got to get each hold on a minute I know how to do it now I know what to do I know exactly what to do I know what to do jigsaw you're fucked I'm coming out I'm getting out of this alive I know I know what to do you have to get a solid white on each row don't try to get it all in one go you try to get it okay I get it I know what to do
[310:03.27]I have no idea what to do.
[310:04.98]I have no idea what's going on.
[310:14.74]Hold on.
[310:15.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[310:27.31]Jigsaw, am I allowed to use my phone?
[310:29.11]I'm on my phone.
[310:29.71]He didn't take my phone.
[310:30.39]He's an idiot.
[310:30.81]He didn't take my phone away when I got into the front door.
[310:35.39]This video is removed from YouTube.
[310:36.88]Why?
[310:38.86]So if you've never solved a cube before, it may seem impossibly hard.
[310:42.18]But today I'll be teaching you a method that I used to teach many people who did not believe they would ever be able to solve a cube.
[310:47.96]And if anything along the way becomes unclear and you need more examples, then you can check the example solve, which I have a link to in the description.
[310:54.46]With that being said, it's time for you to solve your first cube.
[310:58.49]So the first thing you do is find
[311:03.35]What?
[311:04.55]What?
[311:07.41]What?
[311:11.09]Which bottom?
[311:11.89]There's no bottom.
[311:13.40]There is no top.
[311:14.10]There is no left and right.
[311:18.46]Oh, it's because he has a different cube.
[311:22.24]Fuck.
[311:23.80]He has a different cube.
[311:24.46]He has one that has an actual centerpiece.
[311:28.17]Oh, this person is so intelligent.
[311:29.91]Way too intelligent for me.
[311:35.48]That person's way too smart for me.
[311:36.75]Alright, hold on.
[311:37.41]I'm going to do it my way.
[311:48.55]Remove the stickers.
[312:00.68]Just pull the stickers up.
[312:04.48]Remove the stickers.
[312:14.56]I have to just... If you get one side... No, these are not even possible.
[312:19.83]Is it weird that I feel like if you can do a Rubik's Cube just by looking at it, that you are on another plane of intelligence or existence or something?
[312:27.83]You can just look at it and do it.
[312:35.52]Guys, I have trouble with... You know when you have to look at a telephone, and it has the letters and the numbers corresponding to each one?
[312:43.25]I still have trouble spelling a word, still.
[312:47.47]I'm not going to be able to do a Rubik's Cube.
[312:51.62]Some people can just like... It's like, you're an alien.
[312:58.04]You're an alien person.
[312:59.92]You are an alien.
[313:01.42]And you have like a hyper alien intelligence.
[313:03.33]Not me.
[313:04.11]I can't even figure out how to fucking telephone.
[313:06.93]You can do it.
[313:07.51]I can't do it.
[313:26.86]I can't do it.
[313:27.46]It's too hard.
[313:28.81]I don't know.
[313:29.21]I don't understand it.
[313:29.97]It's too many.
[313:31.69]It's too much.
[313:33.30]You can't give up.
[313:34.20]I'm gonna give up.
[313:35.54]I'm gonna give up in about five seconds.
[313:54.50]Wait, hold on.
[313:56.42]And then... And then... I don't wanna hear the Saw theme song again.
[314:09.05]I don't wanna hear it again.
[314:11.17]Imagine he's playing this through the speakers in the room.
[314:15.59]He loves this shit.
[314:16.71]He's just repeating this into the megaphone.
[314:27.01]I'm never gonna be able to figure this out ever This is so funny though, I love this I can't how did you even do this dude?
[314:43.96]So, how do I give up do I just like inhale the gas I
[314:49.23]call someone for help who's who's no one's gonna help me right now I know I'm gonna have no one to help me you can't phone a friend in the jigsaw room and by the way I have to phone a friend and I have to get the one specific guy that knew anything anything at all about like the incan empire right like this is a very specific question it's not like just oh hey by the way uh what's two +2

[315:32.04]No one can help me.
[315:34.02]No one can help me.
[315:47.50]I can't call it.
[315:48.16]No, I'm not going to bother somebody.
[315:51.27]Uh, hey, yeah I just want to let you know I'm in a room full of gas right now.
[315:55.00]Actually that is like a good like time to call somebody.
[315:57.00]Hey do you know how to do a rubik's cube? I'm in a room that's about like gas is gonna like start filling the room and I'm gonna make 488 million dollars.
[316:03.00]I feel like I that would- I would not bother me if you woke me up at four o'clock in the morning.
[316:09.00]Hey dude, uh you know how make a- do a rubik's cube? Uh even getting five percent of this pot is of life-changing money, um... We can do it for you.

[317:47.00]Not good.
[317:48.76]Not good.
[317:49.44]I barely even have the white side done.
[317:52.60]Okay.
[317:53.66]Well, I'll check back in on you in a few hours.
[317:55.72]See how you're doing.

[318:02.92]Can I have some food or something?
[318:04.04]I'm going to be here for like six hours trying to do this.
[318:06.16]I can order a pizza.
[318:10.03]Just slide it under the door or something.
[318:11.27]I don't know.
[318:12.19]You sick fuck.
[318:13.15]Whatever.
[318:13.83]You bastard.
[318:14.91]I don't know.
[318:15.32]I'm just fucking hungry.
[318:16.16]I might get it eventually.
[318:17.48]There's only one more.
[318:24.62]Okay, there's a white there.
[318:26.98]Wait, hold on.
[318:29.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[318:30.61]Where's the other white?
[318:32.63]Where?
[318:40.32]God, I feel like I'm so close, but so far away from even getting this white side.
[318:43.79]Do the edges first, then the corners.
[318:50.78]What do you mean?
[318:51.46]What?
[318:52.56]Everything's a corner.
[318:53.82]Edges first?
[318:54.38]What do you mean edges first?
[318:55.28]What does that mean?
[319:00.59]You've ruined it.
[319:01.09]What?
[319:02.25]Make a plus sign.
[319:04.56]Make a plus sign?
[319:07.04]Make a plus sign.
[319:09.36]Alright.
[319:09.84]I'm gonna try to make a plus sign.
[319:13.30]I don't... I don't get it.
[319:15.80]Okay, hold on.
[319:16.16]Wait, wait.
[319:16.46]A plus sign.
[319:19.45]Is this... I need one in the middle.
[319:40.60]can't do it I can't do it I can't do it okay I can't I've never had I don't I'm such bad like spatial awareness and like it's never going to happen it will never happen I'm dead in this scenario I'm going to die in this scenario you give me a week I'm I'll die in this scenario you could give me the you could feed me you can give me all kinds of delicious food
[320:06.43]You could come in and, like, give me, like, a back massage.
[320:10.38]You could tell me how to do it.
[320:11.76]Somebody could step by step sit there and go, Okay, Jeremy, bottom row, spin horizontal once.
[320:19.92]And I go, wait, what?
[320:20.82]What'd you say?
[320:21.28]Like, no, there's no way.
[320:22.72]Not gonna happen.
[320:25.59]Use the force brain.
[320:26.55]No, I can't.
[320:27.71]It's impossible.
[320:33.81]You could let me sleep.
[320:35.31]You could be like...
[320:37.26]Jeremy, it's time for you to go to bed now.
[320:40.22]Have you eaten all of your steak, potatoes, green beans, and salmon?
[320:45.32]Yeah, it was delicious.
[320:46.42]I'm very full and I'm very satisfied.
[320:48.93]Good.
[320:49.87]You see that bed over there?
[320:51.27]That's a California king, and it's got silk sheets on it.
[320:55.73]Wow, is that for me?
[320:57.13]Yes, and the room will be kept at exactly 70 degrees Fahrenheit with a 35% humidity.
[321:04.15]I will dim the lights.
[321:05.82]And I will play slight white noise.
[321:09.39]That sounds really relaxing.
[321:11.01]It is.
[321:11.81]And by the way, on the device next to the bed, there is the entire first five seasons of SpongeBob.
[321:18.91]And it's at 100% battery on the iPad.
[321:21.88]Holy shit, I love that.
[321:23.02]That's amazing.
[321:24.78]I can just rest and go to bed and relax about SpongeBob.
[321:27.86]Yes, I'll see you in the morning.
[321:30.01]And I wake up the next morning and like a tray of bacon, eggs, and fucking sausage and toast and shit.
[321:34.76]It's like beans rolls in underneath and it's fresh and it's hot and he just faded.
[321:38.58]Use your breakfast, Jeremy.
[321:40.10]Go for it.
[321:40.62]I know you can do it.
[321:41.78]It would take me a month and I would just live there for a month and I wouldn't solve this.
[321:46.01]I'm doing it every day.
[321:46.71]I would not be able to do it.
[321:51.65]Ever.
[321:53.61]Ever.
[321:54.51]You could hook me up to a machine that kept me alive forever.
[321:57.96]You could inject IVs into both arms and give me drugs.
[322:04.13]Drugs that kept me alive for a hundred thousand years and I would not do it.
[322:10.59]It still wouldn't happen.
[322:13.69]So it would be a rotting fucking skeleton in his weird basement by the time that I even got close.
[322:29.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[323:07.39]Rubik's Cube 2020 solution guide uses the layered method.
[323:10.37]Top layer.
[323:11.13]Get to know your Rubik's Cube.
[323:12.21]Step one, create a daisy.
[323:13.67]Holding your Rubik's Cube.
[323:17.31]Okay, hold on.
[323:20.45]Begin by holding your Rubik's Cube with the yellow center piece in the up.
[323:26.25]Guys, this is a scam cube.
[323:29.47]This is a scam cube.
[323:32.96]There is no center up piece.
[323:35.50]This is a scam cube.
[323:38.34]Where's the center up piece?
[323:41.39]With the yellow center piece on the up face.
[323:44.23]Where's the center piece?
[323:49.81]What the fuck are you talking about?
[323:51.39]I'm reading the guide.
[323:54.92]You're a fucking idiot.
[323:55.82]What?
[323:56.06]Okay.
[323:57.12]Look at the
[324:02.48]Up face.
[324:03.92]Look at the top layer to locate the edge pieces that have a white tile.
[324:07.92]Leave them where they are.
[324:10.10]What?
[324:11.88]The thing in the center.
[324:15.27]The yellow piece in the middle.
[324:16.49]This one?
[324:17.07]But I've moved it around.
[324:22.65]Center of the 9x9.
[324:23.41]Yes, yeah, I, but... Look at the top layer to locate the edge pieces that have a white tile.
[324:30.13]Leave them where they are.
[324:32.64]What?
[324:35.34]Doesn't matter.
[324:35.86]See the example to the right and notice that the stage is okay.
[324:43.54]It's okay if the white tile is not touching the yellow centerpiece.
[324:47.39]We have no white touching the centerpiece.
[324:49.27]Okay, we're good.
[324:52.99]Look at the middle layer.
[324:54.61]Move edge pieces that have a white tile from the middle layer onto the top layer.
[324:58.51]Just kill me.
[324:59.65]Saw, just throw a grenade in the room.
[325:02.64]And then just donate all this money.
[325:04.32]Like, just roll the grenade in the room and just donate the money.
[325:08.16]I don't want it.
[325:12.01]Boom!
[325:14.45]I don't care.
[325:17.63]Look at the middle.
[325:18.19]They have moved edge pieces.
[325:19.55]They have a white tile from the middle layer onto the top layer.
[325:24.93]Like this?
[325:28.93]I don't know.
[325:31.50]Be careful not to bump out the white edges already in the daisy.
[325:35.29]Rotate the up face to move a white edge out of the way before moving another white edge into the daisy.
[325:40.03]Throw the grenade.
[325:48.19]Word s- Word salad.
[325:56.13]I'm trying to have the fucking end of the movie in my head.
[326:00.99]Rotate the up face to move a white edge out of the way before moving another white edge into the daisy.
[326:09.06]Put the yellow on top.
[326:14.96]wait you look at the bottom layer move edge pieces that have a white tile from the bottom layer onto the top layer and flip it or sometimes when you place the edge in the top layer the white tile is not on the up face and it needs to be flipped to flip the edge so the white tile is on the up face hold your rubik's cubes the edge that needs to be flipped is on the right our face follow the algorithm what algorithm it's not a math problem let me follow the algorithm there is no algorithm
[326:50.17]FOLLOW THE ALGORITHM!
[326:53.66]He's gonna ADH just for- Saw?
[326:57.20]Saw, hello?
[326:58.50]Saw?
[326:58.86]Yes, what is it?

[327:03.90]A very long time.
[327:06.70]I am ready for you to throw the grenade down to, like, the tube.
[327:09.83]That's where- I know where you're sitting.
[327:11.03]You have, like, a big, like, PVC pipe tube.
[327:12.61]Just drop it down there.
[327:13.53]Please.
[327:14.39]Just throw the grenade at me.
[327:15.53]Please.
[327:16.07]Just throw the grenade.

[327:27.47]You don't have to pay anything.
[327:29.15]You don't have to solve this and I'll feed you the best food that exists.
[327:32.31]No, um, just throw the grenade down.
[327:34.24]I'm done with it.

[327:44.60]Okay.
[327:45.84]Alright, well, good luck.
[327:48.00]Thanks, uh...
[327:49.79]Sorry, I couldn't get it done.
[327:52.35]I would have loved to have tried and done it.
[327:55.23]But now he's playing... Why are you playing this music, Saw?
[328:03.04]Are you okay?
[328:03.50]Are you okay, Saw?
[328:09.36]You held it for way too long.
[328:20.24]You held the grenade, but how do I get out of here?
[328:26.74]I have to get out of this room.
[328:28.26]Now I'm stuck here for two months.
[328:33.32]He has a robot to live with.
[328:35.96]Oh, my God.
[328:37.52]No.
[328:44.17]I'm going to die down here.
[328:45.41]I was supposed to die down here, but he didn't let me.
[328:50.93]He fucking held it for too long.
