[00:01.11]Okay, we got mild, spicy, or hot.
[00:19.30]Well, I think we're gonna have to go with... We're gonna have to go with... Well, which one's harder?
[00:24.00]Spicy or hot?
[00:25.18]Headshot count.
[00:26.58]I bet I can get more headshots than you.
[00:29.01]You're an old bastard.
[00:30.95]And I'll duel you in abilities.
[00:32.79]Duel in abilities.
[00:33.67]No, I've used abilities.
[00:36.25]I could use more abilities than you.
[00:37.59]I just press 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:41.44]Literally, how do we get the fuck out of here?
[00:43.26]Just let it, just let it play out.
[00:45.36]Well, it won't, we can't get off this screen, it won't let us off this fucking screen.
[00:48.24]Oh no, now it's telling me to remove a bet?
[00:51.36]Bet confirmed.
[00:51.90]What?
[00:52.28]Abilities used.
[00:53.18]It's like a pick and ban, it's like, it's like a MOBA.
[00:55.34]It's like, I get to ban one bet, you get to initiate one bet.
[01:01.88]Gotta tip on a possible ditto in this building.
[01:05.16]We gotta get back out there.
[01:06.65]Somebody's shooting in this building and they're just completely missing.
[01:10.35]Oh, it's this guy.
[01:11.81]He's pretty big.
[01:14.92]I'm just gonna punch you now.
[01:17.77]Okay.
[01:18.25]Okay.
[01:19.31]Hey, remember when we put this on mild?
[01:22.84]He kicked me once.
[01:26.39]Watch out behind you.
[01:31.58]Why do we have this game?
[01:32.64]This sucks.
[01:36.30]Yeah, because this is how the movie was.
[01:38.96]This is totally true to the movie.
[01:40.50]Watch out for the old fish guy.
[01:42.27]They're all old fish guys.
[01:43.67]Look at this old fish guy.
[01:44.77]Yeah, they really are old guppies.
[01:47.79]See the guy with the car door?
[01:49.69]He does have a car door.
[01:50.77]Who are these freaking... I get it, you died, but that doesn't turn you into a complete psycho and zombie.
[01:57.55]Like, this is offensive.
[01:58.69]This is unrealistic.
[01:59.71]You probably have to watch the movie to understand what's going on here.
[02:02.31]No, exactly what's going on right now is probably what the movie is.
[02:05.65]It's how we shoot, dude!
[02:06.75]Remember that game, Left 4 Dead, that, like, is just way better than this in every conceivable way, and, like, pretty much is the same game?
[02:13.07]They didn't have guns in Left 4 Dead.
[02:16.21]They weren't fish guys.
[02:17.79]This guy has a plunger behind you.
[02:19.41]I'm just gonna let him plunge- No, he's plunging me!
[02:21.47]I kinda do forget where I am.
[02:22.75]Is this Ryan Reynolds?
[02:24.39]Side door!
[02:25.83]Back it up!
[02:26.73]Watch out!
[02:28.10]You're not even helping me.
[02:30.30]Do I even really need to?
[02:31.20]Yeah, that's why I'm a freaking... I'm a ghost!

[02:58.44]Dude, this guy's got the car door behind us.
[03:02.90]Another car door.
[03:04.36]They couldn't have come up with another model until it wasn't just car doors.
[03:07.66]Ooh, I got achievement!
[03:09.03]I got achievement!
[03:12.47]Dude, these guys, where are they getting all these car doors?
[03:15.31]Have you used your... I'm using the fifth killstreak.
[03:18.19]You have the vine?
[03:20.99]It just, like, lifted people.
[03:22.27]Alright, well, what is this one, then?
[03:24.07]That was cool.
[03:25.78]That's the ghost one!
[03:27.02]I was screaming ghost!
[03:28.78]You wouldn't listen to me!
[03:30.16]I thought you were just saying what we were!
[03:32.34]No!
[03:32.76]I was saying what I was!
[03:34.21]They're coming at us with the car doors!
[03:36.55]You're messing around!
[03:37.43]Well, whatever.
[03:39.67]We're okay.
[03:42.07]I don't think we are.
[03:43.21]They have car doors.
[03:44.45]Alright, do you know what these things are called?
[03:46.97]What?
[03:47.35]Criminals are strong and powerful deados.
[03:50.16]Yeah, they're called deados.
[03:51.44]They're called deados?
[03:52.54]Yes.
[03:53.42]This game was written by Burger Boy.
[03:58.55]Arrest him?
[04:00.91]I'm arresting this guy?
[04:04.33]Oh, they're giving us choice.
[04:06.21]You can- What choice did we have?
[04:25.77]No.
[04:26.87]Go look.
[04:27.57]No.
[04:28.77]Yes, it's only a wave shooting game.
[04:30.18]No, they wouldn't make a game this bad.
[04:31.86]They wouldn't do that.
[04:34.22]You find me a single player campaign that's like acted in like it's like the game like no the game is just go in and shoot waves of people.
[04:41.25]That's it.
[04:41.69]Oh, you're right.
[04:43.09]No.
[04:44.03]So we've done everything there is to do already.
[04:46.75]Wow.
[04:47.53]There is nothing besides.
[04:49.37]This is a 26 on Metacritic.
[04:51.05]And there's like five levels.
[04:53.33]We have played it like almost the entire game.
[04:56.38]We just didn't do the other maps.
[04:57.58]I keep picking just awful game choices.
[05:00.34]I'm sorry.
[05:02.39]I thought it was going to be a single player campaign where like the fake Ryan Reynolds is like, hey guys, howdy doody.
[05:08.10]And I could... Howdy doody?
[05:11.72]Hey guys, howdy doody.
[05:13.46]I don't know, there's a cowboy in it.
[05:16.54]Hey guys, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
[05:17.90]Look at me, I'm totally that exact guy.
[05:20.24]I played Deadpool in that one movie.
[05:23.20]I wanted to play this game so bad.
[05:25.90]What people don't understand is I've been asking you to play this with me for like two weeks.
[05:33.36]I really have.
[05:34.64]You have been begging me to play Rest in Peace Department with you.
[05:40.08]You've been bringing it up.
[05:41.66]You've been sending me messages.
[05:42.94]When are we going to play RIPD?
[05:44.39]When are we going to play RIPD?
[05:45.77]And look at it.
[05:46.47]This is all it is.
[05:47.53]It's just guys with car doors.
[05:50.13]Forever.
[05:51.23]Are you happy that we played it?
[05:53.03]Are you happy that the two weeks of bugging to play this game was worth it?
[05:57.40]Was it worth it?
[06:03.88]bugging you for two weeks.
[06:07.62]As if you would bug me so much.
[06:09.08]What?
[06:09.22]What?
[06:09.36]This car door can't, like, oh, this guy will not die to a minigun, because he's got a car door.
[06:16.99]Finding this hard to believe.
[06:18.17]Very unrealistic.
[06:19.43]Uh, 9 out of 10.
[06:20.67]I'd totally go buy this game again.
[06:22.69]You can go be the guys from that movie you probably didn't see.
[06:25.89]I didn't.
[06:27.93]Why would someone make something like that?
[06:30.59]Come on!
