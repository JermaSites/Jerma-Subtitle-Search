[00:06.96]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:10.03]Jerma here with Electronic Super Joy.
[00:15.73]It's a game that was at PAX Prime 2013, and I got a chance to play it.
[00:19.87]I don't know why I'm doing like Pee Wee Herman Kermit the Frog here, but Miss Piggy is going to be joining us soon.
[00:24.73]She's going to be in the...
[00:26.49]Okay, so first and foremost, we need to make a couple of warnings here.
[00:30.02]This game is outrageous.
[00:32.36]There's a lot of colors.
[00:33.71]There's a lot of noise.
[00:35.25]So if you can't handle the fire, then get out of the kitchen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39.69]DJ, go!
[00:42.31]Ay, jumps.
[00:43.25]Ay, jumps.
[00:44.12]Get to the checkpoint.
[00:45.02]Get to the checkpoint.
[00:45.94]Go.
[00:46.38]Go.
[00:46.84]Jump.
[00:47.76]Welcome.
[00:48.44]We've been waiting.
[00:49.40]Flag forever for you.
[00:51.44]Welcome to Super Meat Boy.
[00:53.00]That's not Super Meat Boy.
[00:54.13]Fuck you.
[00:54.65]Go.
[00:55.25]Oh, yeah.
[00:56.15]Oh, yes.
[00:57.03]Welcome to this huffing fest.
[00:58.87]This is where we jump all over the place.
[01:03.09]Alright, so, let me go back here.
[01:05.93]It's a game about jumping.
[01:07.32]It's a game about not jumping and finding your way over platforms.
[01:11.50]What the fuck?
[01:12.40]Oh, right, right.
[01:13.80]Okay.
[01:16.56]I'm going to blow through this whole game, by the way, just to let you know.
[01:22.27]I have a feeling I'm going to get through this whole game in less than 10 minutes.
[01:25.47]Are you ready?
[01:26.19]Start counting.
[01:28.63]This music is, like, pumping me up, man.
[01:30.33]This is sick.
[01:32.21]Alright, here we go.
[01:32.69]This is the real game.
[01:33.35]Here we go.
[01:33.69]Let's do it, baby.
[01:35.67]Boink.
[01:38.28]Uh, dude.
[01:40.80]Nice day.
[01:41.40]Yeah, it is a pretty nice day out.
[01:43.12]Except for, like, the weird trees that are growing instantly.
[01:50.55]That's highly inappropriate, but you know what?
[01:53.33]Let's just go.
[01:53.95]Oh, I played this game at PAX, like I said.
[02:01.24]It's a very in-your-face platformer.
[02:02.88]I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:06.72]Boing, boing, boing.
[02:07.88]I like it.
[02:08.34]I like the checkpoint flags.
[02:09.60]That's a very big deal.
[02:11.45]Because that means if I die, I can go right back to right there.
[02:17.05]Am I... Is this gonna kill me if I touch this?
[02:20.01]No, it's not.
[02:20.79]It's just there to, like, give you a seizure.
[02:24.07]Okay.
[02:25.00]Cool.
[02:27.97]Oh, okay, the world's moving now, we get a procedurally moving level.
[02:31.39]Those bouncy around... Okay!
[02:36.61]Whoa, look out!
[02:38.78]Look out!
[02:39.08]There we go.
[02:43.02]Just gotta feel the music, feel the beat, and you'll be all set.
[02:47.44]Damn it!
[02:50.76]Okay, okay, I know what to do.
[02:52.72]No, I don't.
[02:53.22]Shit.
[02:58.75]Gotta go fast.
[02:59.99]That's the most important thing.
[03:01.99]Stay on top of it just like Super Meat Boy.
[03:03.85]Oh my god, I keep hitting the top of that stupid thing.
[03:08.77]I feel like I've had a rave.
[03:16.10]Alright, be careful, careful, careful.
[03:19.82]Where am I?
[03:24.16]Oh, press Y to quick respawn.
[03:26.08]Alright, I got you.
[03:29.20]Oh, I'm losing pace here.
[03:35.44]Here we go, I can catch up now.
[03:39.84]This is like level two.
[03:41.98]Oh, shit.
[03:43.77]I'm good.
[03:45.79]I'm good.
[03:47.59]Oh, jeez.
[03:49.77]Quick respawn, go.
[03:50.59]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[03:58.68]God damn it.
[03:59.68]Can I make it?
[04:00.12]Can I make it?
[04:02.42]Uh-oh.
[04:05.38]Is this gonna be a rage game?
[04:07.38]I think so.
[04:12.74]So you keep your forward momentum when you go through those things.
[04:15.56]Good to know.
[04:16.64]Good.
[04:17.34]To.
[04:18.02]Know.
[04:18.72]That.
[04:21.95]I shouldn't have done that because I don't know what's ahead of me.
[04:26.73]There it is, alright.
[04:28.65]These walls are all sticky.
[04:30.50]Gross.
[04:33.12]Here comes the Super Meat Boy platforming.
[04:39.20]I didn't even need to do that.
[04:41.06]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:42.71]Okay, slow it down here.
[04:43.87]I can't even breathe right now.
[04:45.81]This is horrible.
[04:49.05]I can't... I can't do it.
[04:50.79]I need to squint my eyes to do this.
[04:53.93]Jeez.
[04:58.79]Where am I?
[05:01.37]Stick on the sticky walls.
[05:02.39]Get on like the cream cheese.
[05:04.57]Come on, stick to like the cream cheese!
[05:07.29]Ugh!
[05:10.07]Alright, I got this.
[05:11.19]Would I say I was going to beat this game in ten minutes?
[05:13.95]I would like to formally retract that statement.
[05:17.22]Because this game is a lot more difficult.
[05:20.72]That's a bouncy thing.
[05:23.82]Bounce, checkpoint.
[05:28.29]Oh my god, I don't think I can get used to that lady going like, oh yeah!
[05:37.30]There it is, there's the exit.
[05:39.16]Holy shit, that's not the exit!
[05:42.80]That was not the exit.
[05:49.85]Okay, there we go.
[05:51.93]Oh my god, give me a break.
[05:57.83]I can't even tell if I'm stuck on this thing right now.
[06:08.12]I just can't even... I can't even like... I can't... This fucking level with like the spinning like windmill behind the background is really gonna make me start to throw up, so I can't even... Hold on.
[06:23.14]I'm being quiet.
[06:24.04]Let's get this done.
[06:36.85]How do I get up there?
[06:39.72]You tell me I gotta pick one of these and it's gonna... Okay.
[06:44.08]This game... This game... I can't... What the hell, man?
[06:53.24]The music's great.
[06:55.88]I have to... Yep, I'm gonna hit these... What?
[07:04.86]Stop sending me back here!
[07:09.66]That's how you kill the enemies.
[07:10.58]You gotta, like, do, like, the jump smash on them.
[07:12.28]You gotta do, like... ...the Donkey Kong ground pound thing, where you jump in the air.
[07:16.24]Or is that Yoshi?
[07:17.00]I forget.
[07:17.40]One of those, like... ...dumbass Nintendo characters.
[07:20.11]I don't remember which one.
[07:22.69]I did it, thank God.
[07:23.47]Alright, at least we're back to, like... ...having color in our lives, and not, like, this spinning... ...dumbass shit.
[07:37.83]So this is really bringing me back to memories of Super Meat Boy.
[07:41.03]When I would, you know, oh.
[07:44.27]Yes.
[07:48.18]Did you hear that?
[07:50.36]Did you hear that?
[07:51.22]I can't concentrate.
[07:57.56]Yes.
[07:59.42]Yes.
[08:08.94]Dammit.
[08:15.82]We got like Hannibal Lecter in the game, apparently.
[08:19.51]Yes.
[08:20.11]Holy shit!
[08:23.45]I didn't even know... These are stickies, right?
[08:31.26]No, no, they just make you move really fast and you can't stop.
[08:36.15]It's like ice.
[08:38.03]Thanks for telling me there was ice.
[08:40.05]You son of a bitch.
[08:42.01]I didn't even pay attention to that.
[08:43.22]I just fell right down.
[08:48.20]Oh, boy.
[08:49.94]Oh, boy.
[08:52.54]Oh!
[08:54.62]See, I'm, like, all, like, hyped up right now.
[08:56.96]Like, I'm just pissed.
[09:00.40]Pissed!
[09:04.93]So, those of you that remembered the Super Meat Boy series, where, like, I would play Super Meat Boy, you probably will get a kick out of this series as well, because the same shit's gonna happen.
[09:14.33]Oh, no!
[09:15.37]Missiles.
[09:16.53]You can smash missiles with B. Yeah, you jump and you hit them.
[09:19.29]I get you.
[09:19.81]Okay.. So, as long as they don't hit you... What?
[09:24.82]Okay.
[09:32.00]Oh, my God!
[09:35.85]I gotta be patient, stop being such a psycho, and just wait a second.
[09:40.01]Damn.
[09:43.03]No!
[09:44.59]No!
[09:46.15]Alright, waiting patiently has like really done nothing for me, just go.
[09:52.15]There it is.
[09:54.30]That was a skill shot.
[09:57.92]Where the hell are we?
[09:58.94]Oh, okay, it's a procedurally, another procedurally moving level.
[10:04.93]Fell too far behind on this one.
[10:08.30]How was I supposed to know what that thing even did?
[10:10.84]There was no indication what that was even gonna do.
[10:16.90]Where's like my tutorial for that bullshit, huh?
[10:20.83]Can I touch him?
[10:21.99]No, I can't.
[10:22.47]He's an enemy.
[10:23.13]Okay, cool.
[10:24.51]Very cool.
[10:25.13]No- Motherfucker!
[10:33.70]Oh, there's so many swears in this video.
[10:36.93]This, like, series is just a whole one big giant swear.
[10:41.11]I'm sorry.
[10:43.79]Don't go down there.
[10:45.15]Yeah, no kidding, huh?
[10:50.02]Whoa.
[10:52.04]Whoa.
[10:53.60]Oh, okay.
[10:55.10]He told me not to go down there.
[10:57.00]I want it.
[10:57.94]I can't get it.
[10:58.36]Never mind.
[10:58.84]Turn back.
[10:59.56]Right away.
[11:02.73]Watch out.
[11:08.70]This, like, tilted world thing is really not cool.
[11:14.50]Oh, bring on, oh yeah, bring on the dubstep.
[11:18.48]No!
[11:18.94]Yes.
[11:19.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:34.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:36.85]Yeah.
[11:38.79]Maybe I should move to, like, the beat.
[11:40.41]Will that help, you think?
[11:41.15]Here we go, I'm gonna move to the beat.
[11:43.50]That didn't help at all.
[11:50.02]No more messing around.
[11:52.06]No more jokes.
[11:53.54]Just do it.
[11:56.49]I gotta make, like, Burgah Boy proud.
[11:57.99]Me and Burgah Boy like no-lifed Super Meat Boy, so...
[12:08.51]That was risky.
[12:10.53]How am I going to get through this?
[12:20.27]You got to make it up here before that comes out.
[12:27.51]There we go.
[12:29.49]Get rid of these before I go any further.
[12:34.41]I thought I was going to miss it.
[12:40.26]To the developer that made this game, seriously, thank you for the checkpoints.
[12:44.04]Thank you for making the checkpoints.
[12:45.99]If this game had no checkpoints, my controller would have already been through the wall, and this video would have ended.
[12:51.33]Well, these videos would have ended.
[12:53.31]I'm not even sure how many there are going to be.
[13:00.56]What?
