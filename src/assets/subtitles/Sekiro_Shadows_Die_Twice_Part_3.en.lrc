[00:01.77]Hey, it's me!
[00:04.75]Jeffrey!
[00:11.54]Liar?
[00:11.98]What do you mean, liar?
[00:15.50]That scared me.
[00:19.72]Don't be scared.
[00:28.12]Hey, Jeffrey.
[00:36.16]Jeffrey's the name of your cat.
[00:37.78]It's also the name of the Toys R Us giraffe.
[00:42.67]Is the Toys R Us giraffe still in the commercials?
[00:44.57]Does Toys R Us still have commercials?
[00:48.49]Or did they blow their entire advertising budget in, like, 96, and then just hope that the $500 million they spend every day on TV, people just remember who they are?
[01:07.54]They're bankrupt.
[01:08.26]Well... Looks like somebody had to grow up eventually.
[01:15.63]I don't wanna grow up.
[01:17.07]I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[01:18.51]Until the fucking tax man comes.
[01:20.89]And the 400 franchises you have go under.
[01:23.78]Gonna have to grow up.
[01:38.70]What's with all the sad faces?
[01:42.08]You haven't even shopped there.
[01:43.68]When was the last time you've been to Toys R Us?
[01:45.14]You haven't even probably seen the inside of it.
[01:46.50]You probably never even Google image searched Toys R Us.
[01:56.80]Makes me sad to remember.
[01:59.68]The toy grocery store.
[02:06.21]I don't like this meme, Jeff.
[02:07.53]Bring back Jerma.
[02:08.37]Alright.
[02:08.77]I'll be right back.
[02:30.03]Hey, guys.
[02:30.91]It's me, Jerma.
[02:32.85]I'm the friendly one.
[02:36.08]That's some good coffee.
[02:42.94]Do a co-op stream with Jeffrey.
[02:45.52]Nah.
[02:47.30]We're gonna go back to Sekiro.
[02:49.00]It took a couple days to kind of get better.
[02:51.09]I was feeling, as you know from the last stream, a little fucked up.
[02:56.57]A little under the weather.
[02:58.61]And I'm feeling a little better.
[03:05.61]So without further ado, we're going to pick up exactly where we left off.
[03:10.53]I haven't even opened the game.
[03:13.64]Which has been hard, because I've really wanted to play.
[03:20.22]Kick the plebs out, what lie?
[03:21.84]Oh, you're talking about sub only.
[03:31.27]Do it!
[03:32.09]Wait, easy, hold on, we could wait a few minutes.
[03:36.51]Doesn't have to be immediate sub only.
[03:42.05]He's gonna play terrible because it's been two days.
[03:44.36]No, that's not true.
[03:46.06]I should do fairly well.
[03:47.80]Because, you see, in real life, I picked up a broom, and I told Etalyx and Kim to both, like, throw shit at me.
[03:55.00]And to both, like, come at me with, like, all kinds of weapons and stuff, and I, like, was blocking them and parrying them.
[04:01.46]So, I've been, in real life, I've been practicing.
[04:04.86]You know, I can't like just pick up that fucking phone and just throw it at me.
[04:09.30]I don't want to just do it.
[04:10.18]I'm ready.
[04:11.76]And they hit me right in the fucking mouth.
[04:14.27]Broke all my teeth.
[04:15.95]But to get good, right?
[04:16.97]I went to the hospital, got good.
[04:19.07]You know, got a $2,500 hospital bill.
[04:23.61]Got it, you know.
[04:30.34]Let's go.
[04:35.47]Sub only now?
[04:36.53]Not yet.
[04:39.51]Where even are we?
[04:43.04]So those of you that don't know, this is Sekiro Shadowstack twice.
[04:48.68]We were going down through the Sunken Temple.
[04:50.59]Let me just remember the buttons, hold on.
[04:54.83]Right trigger, right trigger, right trigger.
[05:01.57]Okay, now I remember.
[05:03.98]So this is the sniper roost.
[05:08.06]Does this game have multiplayer?
[05:10.60]No, it does not.
[05:11.86]There is no multiplayer in this game.
[05:13.67]No invasions.
[05:14.63]Well, that's a lot of stuff over there.
[05:15.89]That's probably a trap, though.
[05:21.53]Let's just go get it.
[05:26.83]Is it a trap?
[05:28.19]Ooh, I can see that.
[05:29.19]Can I jump up there?
[05:30.37]No, no, no, no, no!
[05:31.55]Okay, well now we've remembered this forward momentum.
[05:36.21]This forward momentum in Sekiro, right?
[05:38.08]If you jump, you kind of just jump forward.
[05:40.28]That's not a death, doesn't count.
[05:41.50]People are counting those.
[05:44.54]I want to make it very clear, that's not a death.
[05:48.02]It takes away like 30%, 40% of your health bar.
[05:50.26]Not a death.
[05:50.66]Alright, let's just go.
[05:56.51]I hear something.
[05:59.17]I think I hear a goofball over here.
[06:01.05]Oh my God, what the fuck is that?
[06:05.63]Okay, well it begins.
[06:08.73]That's like Wolverine.
[06:09.93]That's like they dug up Wolverine 100 years after he died.
[06:14.61]And this is probably a boss.
[06:16.82]Yeah, long arm centipede giraffe.
[06:22.66]Okay, nice to meet you.
[06:26.26]What is this name?
[06:31.25]What kind of name is this?
[06:34.91]Oh shit, it's Jeffrey from Toys R Us!
[06:38.85]Alright, so he's got 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... Is that all he does?
[06:47.09]Well, he's fucking relentless, that's for sure.
[06:48.95]Alright.
[06:51.55]So it's 1, 2, 3, 4... That face!
[07:03.43]Okay, I got it.
[07:05.88]That's a Slash?
[07:07.28]I don't know.
[07:11.30]So I gotta, you just gotta parry the fuck out of this guy.
[07:13.88]So we got the Slash.
[07:17.83]And then we're just gonna make it come here.
[07:19.31]One, two, three.
[07:22.07]See you later.
[07:22.63]One down.
[07:23.01]No, I didn't get it!
[07:23.67]Okay, there's one.
[07:32.34]What am I facing?
[07:32.90]What the fuck was that?
[07:34.66]Why was I facing backwards?
[07:37.58]Oh my god, that was stupid!
[07:39.67]That was stupid.
[07:42.15]Why was my back turned?
[07:44.27]I can get him right here.
[07:46.13]That was actually stupid.
[07:58.62]Again.
[08:08.27]Do it again.
[08:08.63]Dad, you're dead.
[08:12.25]Okay, that was fucking dumb.
[08:15.65]I had my back to him.
[08:16.87]Like, he was just hitting me right in the ass.
[08:22.82]Anyways, he's dead.
[08:24.18]Yellow gunpowder.
[08:27.18]Sick.
[08:30.64]I gotta get that mouse off the screen.
[08:32.32]Sorry, guys.
[08:36.76]Oh, he beat Jeffrey first try.
[08:38.25]Yeah, back to the bankruptcy board with you, Jeffrey.
[08:43.75]That's... I'm... I'm not saying that.
[08:44.97]That's, like, not nice.
[08:45.61]So, this is, uh, prosthetical upgrades.
[08:48.93]Uh, prayer beads.
[08:50.42]Cool.
[08:57.30]Nice.
[08:57.62]Whoa, that was fun.
[08:59.86]He was fairly easy.
[09:02.16]Not... Well, easy is the wrong term.
[09:03.87]Fairly predictable.
[09:04.77]He does the same kind of chain.
[09:07.19]Some scrap.
[09:07.83]Nice.
[09:10.43]And then a large fan.
[09:16.79]A large fan made of dyed red Japanese Aurelia leaves can be fit into the prosthetic tool.
[09:22.66]Fanning it creates a large vortex of wind.
[09:26.60]Spiriting away those it catches.
[09:28.40]Okay, so it's like a little knockback or something.
[09:35.58]That's probably a knockback.
[09:39.72]Can I look in here?
[09:45.93]Gunfort Shrine Key.
[09:46.99]Alright, so that's just a little mini-boss in front of the... Okay, hold on.
[09:53.37]There was a place to go down here.
[09:54.61]I don't want to start a new area until... There we go.
[10:02.42]Yellow Gunpowder.
[10:03.68]More upgrade materials.
[10:11.84]I still have a little bit of a cough, so you're gonna hear it a few times.
[10:19.43]Alright.
[10:21.49]Well, there's no reason why I wouldn't just refill my shit, right?
[10:24.23]He's not gonna respawn.
[10:35.46]Okay.
[10:37.46]I got my recoveries back.
[10:42.71]Oh, yeah.
[10:46.05]Alright, um, Sunken Valley Passage, we have... Nothing over here.
[10:51.29]Now, everybody, now, don't get too excited.
[11:01.04]Don't get too excited, everybody.
[11:02.84]Because I saw the trailer for the game.
[11:05.36]And unfortunately, if you see a trailer for a video game, you're spoiled to the fact that the giant snake's gonna come up here and attack me right now.
[11:11.28]I did see the trailer.
[11:12.54]I told you.
[11:12.96]I saw the trailer.
[11:22.44]I saw the trailer in the game.
[11:24.15]Why did I watch the trailer?
[11:36.89]How do I get out of here?
[11:44.47]I'm assuming this way?
[11:45.37]It was part of the E3 presentation and I knew what was gonna happen.
[11:54.58]Do I have to fight this now?
[12:03.28]Boat kick for spoilers.
[12:05.47]Is it a spoiler if two years ago they showed that?
[12:13.27]Oh, Jesus, he's right here.
[12:17.91]People are just like, what the fuck?
[12:22.19]Alright, I'm sorry, let me apologize, because I'm realizing something right now.
[12:28.23]Like, I saw the movie.
[12:29.19]Some of you guys may not have seen the movie.
[12:33.04]So, we were both watching Infinity War right there, and right before the big climax, I told you what happened.
[12:40.85]Hey, dude, I've seen this movie before.
[12:42.17]Have you seen this movie?
[12:43.21]No, I haven't.
[12:44.05]Oh, well, dude, watch what happens when he gets killed right here.
[12:47.80]Oh, okay.
[12:49.92]Yeah, it was cool, huh?
[12:51.10]Did you like it?
[12:52.78]Yeah, I guess I did.
[13:01.37]Vote kick.
[13:01.89]You can't vote kick me on my own damage.
[13:03.23]Alright, but there's something going on here.
[13:04.51]What do I... Can I, like, slash him through here?
[13:10.20]Can I kill this thing?
[13:22.93]What's wrong with him?
[13:23.59]Can I jump up on his body?
[13:24.89]I mean, that's very clearly making a bridge.
[13:37.34]Alright, I gotta get to a plant.
[13:39.40]Oh shit, he's staring at me.
[13:43.46]Is there anywhere I can grapple to over here?
[13:53.63]Looking for a grapple point so I can at least make my way up on him.
[13:58.23]Because I can't grab him.
[14:08.17]I wonder if he's gonna attack me from here.
[14:11.56]Nope, okay.
[14:14.98]So he's just set up for me to walk on him.
[14:23.04]Well, I made it.
[14:30.45]Oh, and by the way, I watched a walkthrough up here.
[14:33.26]Just wait till I split his whole body in half.
[14:34.82]I do this thing where I jump, and it's a really, FromSoftware really overdid themselves here.
[14:39.90]You jump and you hold the sword out through his mouth, and you zipline down his whole body to be able to traverse the gap there, and you cut the whole body in half while you zipline down through his whole body.
[15:01.83]Okay.
[15:02.03]I think we just go up, right?
[15:07.96]Item.
[15:09.88]Out of anti-ite scrap.
[15:16.10]You're a jerk.
[15:18.93]This is the cool part right here.
[15:25.99]From what I remember for the trailer.
[15:33.89]Whoa.
[15:35.25]Oh!
[15:42.85]Almost.
[15:45.23]Any more monkeys that jump down?
[15:54.58]I guess I have to jump for... Wait, somebody can see me.
[15:57.88]He can't get up here, right?
[16:01.52]I highly doubt he can.
[16:04.01]Can he?
[16:04.31]I don't think it matters.
[16:14.70]He has a gun.
[16:15.56]Okay.
[16:16.00]Well, that's great to know.
[16:24.59]Not gonna happen.
[16:25.55]Alright.
[16:27.17]So from here, I need to drop down there.
[16:33.87]Do a monkey voice.
[16:37.81]I don't have any monkey voices.
[16:41.45]There's an item over there.
[16:42.23]I'm gonna get that.
[16:46.39]Do it.
[16:47.57]No, I can't.
[17:00.15]You literally can.
[17:10.42]You happy?
[17:14.75]There's an item down here, right?
[17:18.13]Where was that item?
[17:19.07]I saw it from far away.
[17:20.81]Aha, whoa!
[17:23.33]Oh, YouTuber reactions!
[17:26.20]Whoa, whoa!
[17:29.82]Oh shoot, guys, shoot!
[17:36.84]Well, I got more snap seeds.
[17:38.91]Probably gonna need them.
[17:42.76]Can you not swear?
[17:43.54]No, I'm a swearer.
[17:45.94]Sorry, guys.
[17:49.47]I say, like, poop.
[17:52.85]Shit.
[17:56.71]No, I think he's starting to run out of content.
[17:58.49]Shut the fuck up.
[18:00.99]What?
[18:13.98]Mmm, alright down or up.
[18:17.39]Ooh, I don't let's go down.
[18:19.87]There's actually a Can I get back up if I go down here Oh shit, there's like three in here I think Yep.
[18:38.44]Oh Boy
[18:45.94]Oh, you do a lot of damage, too!
[18:47.52]Jesus!
[18:48.44]Oh, Jesus, get me out!
[18:55.42]Okay, here comes one.
[18:58.39]That actually... This is a really bad place to fight anyone.
[19:11.99]Fuckin' goddammit!
[19:15.68]I have like firecrackers, what the fuck am I doing?
[19:17.92]I'll just forget.
[19:29.72]Wow, that's the easiest way to get rid of them.
[19:36.75]Damn, alright.
[19:47.26]Okay, this is the surprise level.
[19:53.79]Contact medicine, weak poison status have been inflicted.
[19:56.21]Okay.
[19:59.13]Yeah, we're... Okay.
[20:10.32]Back it up.
[20:24.43]Alright.
[20:24.59]Where are they?
[20:26.70]I don't even know where they're all coming from.
[20:35.86]There is an item here, though, I think.
[20:38.43]I think.
[20:47.67]No, I think it was just the...
[20:50.76]Spirit emblems.
[20:52.46]I might be mis-seeing things.
[20:54.90]Nope, it's right there.
[20:56.22]There's actually two.
[21:03.67]And one down here.
[21:10.85]Sugar!
[21:14.16]I hear movement.
[21:23.19]That better not be what I think it is.
[21:27.25]I see green.
[21:29.47]I got a story for you guys.
[21:31.31]By the way.
[21:33.01]This is a true story.
[21:33.89]This happened... Last night.
[21:39.15]Do you want to hear something fucking insane?
[21:42.51]So me and Kim have been sick, right?
[21:45.41]And the reason why I'm looking at that on this is because it reminds me of Ecto Cooler.
[21:48.92]And if that... Let me just finish my last statement.
[21:50.76]If that's a poison swamp, this is the worst game ever made.
[21:55.00]So let's just be clear on that.
[21:56.76]But anyway, so last night, Kim and I were in bed, and we're doing our usual ritual where we just sit there and look on our iPads and our iPhones, just watching random videos.
[22:08.12]We kind of just, like, at a certain point, stop talking and just read and look at stuff, right?
[22:12.52]Like, good night, good night.
[22:13.36]Okay, yeah.
[22:15.14]So, I was watching a video of this guy.
[22:20.82]Because, I don't know, sometimes I get on a kick where I just want to see things from the 80s and old 60s commercials.
[22:27.15]Well, Ecto Cooler, let me read about that.
[22:29.21]That sounds cool.
[22:31.01]And I got on a kick on the Ecto Cooler from Hi-C, which is the Ghostbusters tie-in, right?
[22:35.53]I just was looking up stuff about it.
[22:38.23]So, there's a guy on YouTube that had one from 30 years ago, and he was going to drink it.
[22:43.37]He's like, oh, I found one!
[22:44.75]It was original packaging, it's been expired for 30 years.
[22:48.89]And he opens it up, and he starts talking about it, and the whole time I'm just paying attention to it, and Kim's watching, whatever she's watching, looking the other way.
[22:56.10]So, he eventually gets it into a glass, and he drinks it.
[23:01.00]And instantly, not even five seconds goes by, he fucking pukes.
[23:05.80]Projectile throw-up coming out of his mouth.
[23:08.14]And I was like, oh, that's fucked up.
[23:09.60]Kim looks over.
[23:12.18]sees the puke coming out of his mouth, first time she's paid attention to anything I've been doing in probably two hours, she has an immediate reflex.
[23:20.92]If Kim sees another person throw up, she has an immediate throw-up reflex.
[23:25.57]So she fucking sprints to the bathroom
[23:28.72]puking like and I'm laughing my ass off I can't fucking believe it like that that's that's the shit that she caught me watching like an ecto cooler video so I'm laughing remember I have a cough I start coughing uncontrollably I'm in pain laughing hysterically while I hear her fucking like puking in the toilet
[23:46.27]I can't help it anymore.
[23:48.19]I am in a full coughing fit.
[23:50.19]I get the fuck out of bed.
[23:53.55]I go over to the sink and I start fucking puking in the sink.
[23:57.36]I'm not kidding.
[23:58.16]This is a real fucking story.
[24:02.62]And I was still laughing, so it was like... This is a real story.
[24:08.82]This is 100% true.
[24:16.18]I thought Etalyx was gonna... I think he was still streaming at the time.
[24:21.50]This was at like 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning.
[24:24.60]He was still alive.
[24:26.41]So he didn't hear us.
[24:27.65]I thought we were gonna wake him up and he was gonna think we were fucking dying in here.
[24:34.57]That is fucking real.
[24:38.53]I didn't puke that much though.
[24:40.55]It wasn't like a full puke.
[24:42.33]It was like...
[24:47.62]It was the fucking funniest thing all year.
[24:54.42]I think Star made this comment before.
[24:57.92]And I adhere to it completely.
[24:59.87]He said... He said in the past, I wish if I could go back and have like HD cameras record something in my life, I would want it to be X, right?
[25:10.87]If there was like two or three cameras in the bathroom and like in the bedroom and stuff, I would love to see that footage.
[25:18.81]The whole thing.
[25:20.31]Play up.
[25:25.13]That's so many!
[25:26.19]Oh my god!
[25:33.56]You're not supposed to fight those.
[25:35.28]You're not supposed to fight those monkeys over here.
[25:37.59]Nope.
[25:41.82]That's a joke how many there are.
[25:43.46]How am I supposed to get over there?
[25:44.50]Do I have to climb?
[25:46.36]I have to go across this way.
[25:47.88]There's no way you're gonna make that.
[25:59.08]Oh, Jesus.
[25:59.66]I don't know what the hell you were doing.
[26:06.76]Just firecrack them?
[26:10.61]This is going to be a death here.
[26:20.10]God damn it.
[26:23.38]I'll try.
[26:24.02]I'll try.
[26:24.58]Alright, I'm going in.
[26:27.72]Not yet.
[26:28.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[26:28.38]Let me at least get the item that's over here.
[26:29.83]There's like shit.
[26:34.71]Okay, there's shit like over... No, there's not.
[26:36.81]I'm already good to go.
[26:41.62]Three, two, one.
[26:59.11]I'm gonna get so many points for this.
[27:00.41]I can't dance, I can't call you right now.
[27:24.14]This is not even hard.
[27:40.18]This is not even fun.
[27:42.20]I don't even want to do this anymore.
[27:51.96]Alright, they're getting really close.
[28:04.07]Hey, in Sekiro, this is a FromSoftware game.
[28:06.63]You either die or you don't die.
[28:09.95]I'm sorry.
[28:14.23]How much money was that?
[28:16.04]Wow.
[28:16.90]Nothing, actually.
[28:19.06]Monkey booze.
[28:27.24]I got monkey boos.
[28:30.24]Okay.
[28:32.56]A bunch of community subs came in and I missed them.
[28:35.57]My phone was ringing, community subs came in, and I had to fight like 15 monkeys.
[28:40.75]More than that.
[28:42.41]How many community subs just came in?
[28:43.65]I didn't even see.
[28:48.33]It was like at least 5 to 10, right?
[28:56.00]5, 5.
[28:56.20]Alright, awesome.
[28:58.62]Has JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR?
[29:00.06]Thank you so much, dude.
[29:02.58]More community subs from JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[29:08.70]I kind of like this area.
[29:09.96]Until I look- until that's a poison swamp.
[29:11.68]And if it is, then you know.
[29:13.40]That's two full letter grades down.
[29:25.47]If this game is at an A right now, that makes it a C-.
[29:32.24]Oh, shit.
[29:32.86]Okay, there's an idol there.
[29:37.54]But points can be added back up.
[29:40.32]You know what I mean?
[29:48.77]Uh, I'm gonna get this first, in case I can't get back up.
[29:53.13]Well, that looks like a big... That's a mini-boss, probably.
[30:08.80]I crashed your computer by killing the monkeys.
[30:11.66]No, I didn't.
[30:14.28]I'm still waiting for one more to get this, because that's a pretty big deal.
[30:19.24]I don't have enough of that.
[30:20.10]Alright, let me go look and see what's down here.
[30:22.52]There's an item down this way.
[30:31.77]Balloon of Soul.
[30:34.29]Yeah, that's a green swamp.
[30:41.78]Alright, let's try to fight this.
[30:44.53]See... Thankfully, this run back is pretty easy.
[30:48.75]It's just right here.
[30:49.75]Let me just get that little health back.
[31:03.14]Alright, here we go.
[31:07.18]No, just checking, just checking.
[31:16.47]He's huge.
[31:18.36]Well, I'm already seeing that there's a lot of things to grab onto here.
[31:25.88]How did you even see me?
[31:28.99]Oh, Jesus.
[31:34.75]You have to fly around here.
[31:42.36]I'm just trying to see what it does.
[31:44.66]What about this?
[31:46.88]It's affected a lot by that.
[31:50.06]Sweep?
[31:55.74]It is.
[31:56.88]I'm assuming it's a lot of sweeps.
[32:00.64]Whoa, that hurts!
[32:04.10]Get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out!
[32:16.31]Okay, he's running.
[32:18.63]Holy shit!
[32:19.93]Oh, that's poor.
[32:20.97]That's an instant kill.
[32:21.77]Alright.
[32:29.84]Whoa!
[32:31.06]I don't even know.
[32:31.54]I don't think he can dodge it.
[32:32.36]Do I have to deflect that shit?
[32:34.86]Maybe.
[32:45.66]ow oh shitting in his hand alright that's what that is
[33:19.67]It's hard to get that, sorry.
[33:20.87]There's this thing where he spins around.
[33:37.14]Oh, and he like wiggles around and shit.
[33:39.28]You can't go in when he does that, okay.
[33:44.01]Can't follow that up.
[33:55.97]Ooh, he comes out of that quick.
[33:59.21]I don't have any healing.
[34:06.24]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, what's he doing?
[34:07.52]He's gonna shit at me.
[34:10.35]Okay, you can, you can block it.
[34:21.56]I'm going down here.
[34:31.45]Ooh!
[34:31.89]That's not a... That was a grab!
[34:33.27]Whoa!
[34:33.83]Alright.
[34:37.02]He did like four sweeps in a row and he went for a grab.
[34:48.17]Okay.
[34:52.13]Sounds about right.
[34:52.79]Let's go again.
[34:58.67]I'm going to get in there quick.
[35:00.58]Try to get a couple hits on him now.
[35:01.74]Never mind.
[35:04.88]I mean, look at that wiggle.
[35:23.58]Fuck, I didn't block it.
[35:25.36]Fuck, no, not already.
[35:30.01]I don't think I should be parrying him.
[35:32.81]He does a ton of posture damage, like almost un... unrelenting.
[35:36.21]Ooh, ooh.
[35:50.66]Get me out.
[35:51.70]Oh, fuck.
[35:55.76]It's okay.
[35:56.16]I gotta use these more wisely.
[36:10.78]That's, like, that's the key here.
[36:12.50]Oh, fuck, he's, like, stunned.
[36:23.70]Damn.
[36:31.38]I gotta block that poison thing.
[36:36.44]Comes around.
[36:37.80]Comes again.
[36:38.22]Alright, let's go for a... Come on.
[36:45.45]Here comes the shit.
[36:47.37]No.
[36:50.89]I'm like waiting for it.
[36:58.21]That's not what I wanted to do.
[36:59.01]Alright, alright, easy, easy.
[37:07.94]That's the grab!
[37:09.28]Oh, that sucks!
[37:10.68]It's so hard to determine.
[37:12.58]No!
[37:13.62]Again!
[37:13.96]No, that was a sweep.
[37:21.76]Shitting?
[37:26.28]Oh, there it is again.
[37:27.10]My god.
[37:31.20]That's what best gets done.
[37:33.98]He does like a little shimmy.
[37:34.92]I don't even know who the hell I am.
[37:47.37]That like symbol and into the moves, it's like the hardest thing to get on in this game.
[37:55.28]Because your brain sees the symbol, and then you kind of just panic for a second and go, which one is it?
[38:00.93]Which one is it?
[38:01.41]Alright, I'll get him this time.
[38:13.94]I didn't hit him?
[38:18.76]What?
[38:20.32]What the hell?
[38:20.78]I just wasted two somehow.
[38:22.68]Okay.
[38:28.68]I gotta be closer to that.
[38:45.18]Back it up.
[38:50.22]I think I'm just gonna jump every time.
[39:09.80]Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
[39:13.82]Ah, the cooldown, fuck.
[39:27.17]Ooh, that hurts!
[39:30.39]Oh god, what's he doing?
[39:52.84]Easy!
[40:04.41]Here comes the poop!
[40:04.91]Here comes the poop!
[40:08.87]NOOOO!
[40:24.33]Fucking camera, please don't do this to me, camera!
[40:45.89]Not this time He hasn't done shit at all
[41:04.39]Eat it!
[41:12.69]Easy, back it up, don't get greedy.
[41:19.17]Fuck, no.
[41:25.99]Dammit.
[41:26.43]Not close enough.
[41:29.03]What am I?
[41:29.49]Oh, he shit on me!
[41:31.17]Oh no!
[41:31.85]This is bad!
[41:32.99]Hold on.
[41:47.16]What?
[41:47.50]What the fuck?
[41:48.72]What?
[41:49.04]What's going on here?
[41:50.70]Use!
[41:53.22]I can't use this?
[41:58.53]That was weird.
[42:00.81]Alright, come on.
[42:14.38]Back it up.
[42:14.90]Back it up.
[42:15.68]Back it up.
[42:40.94]What do you got?
[42:54.79]Ooh, don't get greedy!
[43:09.84]Fuck!
[43:14.60]Here comes the shit!
[43:21.18]Oh, fuck!
[43:21.76]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[43:24.26]I got two Res-Rex here, I got it.
[43:30.02]Oh my god, I thought that was gonna stun him or something.
[43:33.44]Oh fuck, that's- oh my god, give me a break.
[43:35.85]Oh, why did I do that?
[43:36.83]I had- I like- I thought it was gonna like, get a hit.
[43:43.87]Damn it.
[43:44.77]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[43:46.87]For some reason, I thought when you latch onto them, you have, like, immunity or something.
[43:50.97]Ugh, no.
[43:53.06]I don't have any pellets either.
[43:54.20]I gotta get this on the bar.
[43:56.66]Fuck, man.
[43:57.22]That was close.
[43:57.76]Yeah, I have no pellets.
[44:02.56]Get that on the bar.
[44:05.36]Damn it, that was close.
[44:12.87]Anything else I need?
[44:21.43]Maybe it might be worth putting one of these on here.
[44:29.14]I want posture.
[44:30.76]Posture.
[44:35.56]Fuck.
[44:41.98]So this is the poison one.
[44:43.96]Man, I'm so like riled up right now too.
[44:45.96]Damn it.
[44:46.40]That was so close.
[44:52.71]I need to take like a sip.
[44:53.71]I'm like a lightning rod right now.
[44:55.49]Damn it.
[45:05.64]I thought that was the one too.
[45:07.04]It's alright.
[45:07.46]Let's go.
[45:14.89]I'll tell you, the first two firecrackers, remember how they didn't land for some reason?
[45:19.44]I feel like that's a victory right there.
[45:21.84]That was, you know, but whatever.
[45:23.78]Can't be mad about that.
[45:35.66]I really wish I could attach.
[45:38.09]Land.
[45:40.21]Let's see.
[45:42.07]No.
[45:42.49]God damn.
[45:42.83]That's a bad.
[45:43.27]This is a bad start.
[45:44.11]Really bad start.
[45:45.21]Yeah.
[45:46.15]This is an awful start.
[45:47.63]Kill me.
[45:49.19]Or do it.
[45:57.04]That was just a bad start.
[46:02.20]Hey Magellan.
[46:02.84]Thanks for the five community subs.
[46:03.90]Magellan36.
[46:09.30]Five subs.
[46:10.53]Thank you.
[46:18.53]Alright, come on.
[46:22.57]I gotta land all of them.
[46:27.07]Wiggle.
[46:28.43]I can just get a couple in here.
[46:30.11]I don't need to do anything.
[46:31.29]Save the... the shit when I need it.
[46:45.35]Get away from that poison.
[46:47.31]Take him to shit!
[46:52.16]Okay, when he throws the shit, I got at least two hits there I can do.
[46:55.84]Here he comes.
[47:12.77]Get away from him.
[47:35.16]Oh, baby!
[47:36.90]Oh, baby!
[47:39.44]Come on!
[47:41.31]Uh-oh, bad, bad!
[47:42.51]Bad, very bad.
[48:12.43]Oh, that's what?
[48:13.29]That's a grab too?
[48:14.89]I thought that was a sweep.
[48:16.53]Oh no.
[48:19.21]Oh no.
[48:22.51]That sucks, man.
[48:24.07]Like, seriously.
[48:25.49]It's alright.
[48:28.15]That just wasted like three.
[48:29.40]That sucks.
[48:31.40]It's so hard to determine what the fuck he's going to do.
[48:33.10]Yeah, this is a really good start too.
[48:37.32]That's unfortunate.
[48:38.08]I still can do it.
[49:01.88]wiggle wiggle wiggle let's just get it let's get a short thing
[49:29.98]Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle!
[49:31.38]Alright, let's go.
[49:51.69]Don't do it don't do it I got I get I got it This is it this is it it's done Goodbye
[50:18.02]Right in the heart.
[50:31.94]Alright.
[50:35.27]Damn.
[50:36.84]That was fun, though.
[50:38.14]Oh, no, of course not.
[50:38.92]Yeah, duh.
[50:39.32]Welcome to FromSoftware.
[50:40.94]Oh, great.
[50:52.93]I gotta learn a whole new fucking moveset now.
[50:57.05]Well, this is fucking fun.
[51:00.87]I don't even know what that is.
[51:05.62]I can't even scare him.
[51:07.92]What, is that a jump?
[51:10.26]Um... Well, this is interesting.
[51:28.55]I mean, you spend the whole time trying to figure out, now I gotta fight another boss.
[51:33.76]Oh, this is great.
[51:50.52]Oh no, someone's rotting.
[51:53.57]Well, this um... Hey, is this a FromSoftware game that was made after 2016?
[52:02.81]Every boss has two or three phases.
[52:05.25]I should be aware of that now.
[52:12.74]Fuck, okay.
[52:21.91]I wonder what the tactic is after he's dead.
[52:42.25]You really can't take that much damage here, though.
[53:04.44]Where you going?
[53:38.89]Back up.
[53:40.03]Oh god.
[53:40.57]Not the camera.
[53:41.25]Not the camera.
[53:42.77]Not the camera.
[53:45.89]Just use one of these now.
[54:01.00]Damn it, no!
[54:02.72]That's bad.
[54:03.90]Not that bad though.
[54:35.67]Wiggle.
[54:46.90]Fuck.
[54:54.68]Asshole.
[54:55.20]Come on.
[54:55.70]He's going to throw...
[55:10.48]Yo!
[55:28.86]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[55:31.30]That was absolute dog shit.
[55:32.99]Like, give me a break.
[55:34.37]Are you serious?
[55:36.63]Really?
[55:39.21]Dodge grabs.
[55:40.45]Except when you can't.
[55:41.27]I did that.
[55:42.29]I timed that so perfectly.
[55:43.79]I did.
[55:44.19]Give me a break.
[55:55.72]And now he's doing this every single time.
[56:08.67]His fucking moveset changed since the last time I fought him.
[56:42.93]I'm not locked on anymore for some reason.
[56:44.96]Why?
[56:51.61]I'm gonna get the fuck away.
[56:52.79]You know what I mean?
[56:54.80]Like, there's no reason to do that.
[57:03.76]Fucking Jesus, how are you supposed to beat this second phase?!
[57:08.10]Why?!
[57:08.64]That didn't do it?
[57:27.42]Why is that not hitting him?
[57:28.80]What the fuck?
[57:30.56]Give me a break!
[57:33.93]What?
[57:34.25]I feel like I'm gonna be here for a while.
[58:01.40]so
[58:25.44]I'm trying to figure out if his ass is more vulnerable or his head.
[58:33.47]I've been hitting his ass.
[58:58.37]He can stagger him though, if you hit him in the head.
[59:00.37]It seems his head is staggered.
[59:02.01]Not so much his ass.
[59:03.49]I'm just trying to hit him.
[59:18.28]I don't think he's slow.
[59:29.35]I'm in trouble now.
[59:35.03]Man, the dodge frames.
[59:36.71]I can't, no.
[59:37.66]God damn it.
[59:38.76]I might stop drinking.
[59:40.76]I'm still alive.
[59:58.20]I... Holy fuck, this is insane.
[60:02.70]The fact that you gotta do this twice, with moves that I've only seen one time... I'll be here for the next three straight days.
[60:27.23]What the hell happened there?
[60:36.91]You gotta get the free tap there.
[60:38.61]You have to on his head.
[60:39.65]You can get it.
[60:41.23]That's what I'm doing.
[60:48.40]I tried to jump.
[60:49.36]Just wasn't fast enough.
[61:09.54]I think it was just so debilitating seeing that I had to fight.
[61:12.06]I like drained a bunch of energy and now I gotta fight this.
[61:15.82]Oh, fuck me.
[61:16.94]This is gonna be horrible.
[61:18.22]Whatever.
[61:19.22]I'll do it.
[61:24.69]Hold on.
[61:25.53]Let me put on... Let me go into my inventory, because... I feel like this shit is worthless.
[61:40.30]So maybe, like, fire... The axe, maybe?
[61:46.62]I wonder.
[61:47.58]I wonder.
[61:53.92]When he goes down, try to get a hit on his ass?
[61:56.20]Or his face, maybe?
[61:59.86]I could try to poison him, too.
[62:00.90]We'll see.
[62:02.01]We'll try the fire.
[62:21.14]Wait for the first wiggle and see what happens.
[62:32.73]The worst part about that is I can't do the fall away.
[62:40.97]He's apparently too big.
[62:43.17]I mean, he's burning.
[62:46.11]How long is he on fire for?
[62:52.25]That's actually not too bad.
[62:53.45]It really isn't.
[62:58.13]Just gotta hit it like a couple times after he does wiggle wiggle.
[63:02.47]Like here, ready?
[63:03.91]Let's go ahead and get it.
[63:07.61]There it is.
[63:14.83]Now that's it.
[63:26.88]It's actually very effective.
[63:32.14]I gotta get out of the corner man, the camera's gonna fuck me.
[63:50.23]I gotta stop dodging that, it's impossible to dodge it if you can't.
[63:52.45]I have to walk it or jump.
[64:03.22]Come here.
[64:19.72]Come on, let me see it again.
[64:48.04]I don't understand, man.
[64:49.21]Like, even me.
[64:50.15]Like, come on.
[64:53.09]Like, really?
[64:55.09]Why is this still a problem?
[64:57.77]Like, what the fuck?
[65:01.73]Why does it have to still be an issue?
[65:05.26]Like, after 15 years!
[65:05.84]Still!
[65:30.00]he's gonna throw shit
[65:55.56]Alright guys, we get to see the second phase again.
[66:00.93]Are you ready?
[66:03.37]I'm excited.
[66:12.75]Can I still hurt him?
[66:14.77]Come on, let me do damage to him now.
[66:44.47]I don't- oh fuck, how do I get rid of terror?
[66:51.99]I'm gonna use that, but hold on.
[66:52.94]Where's the terror one?
[66:56.80]This one, right?
[67:09.99]Oh, man.
[67:12.67]I don't know what the fuck he's doing.
[67:14.55]It was a sweep?
[67:20.01]I don't fucking get it.
[67:21.23]I don't...
[67:22.67]I'm gonna try again.
[67:53.37]Man, it's so awkward.
[67:56.95]Jesus.
[68:07.52]What am I doing?
[68:08.98]That takes so long!
[68:11.16]That takes forever!
[68:12.40]That takes forever!
[68:17.30]Why would you ever have that?
[68:19.83]Oh, I'm gonna do a little stance now and pray.
[68:24.62]I don't have any healing.
[68:28.24]This is fucking INSANE.
[68:39.29]Holy shit.
[68:43.01]It's just- it's fighting just two bosses back to back that are not- they're completely different from each other.
[68:49.36]You gotta fight the- the ape, and then you gotta fight the headless horseman with a sword.
[68:57.66]My goodness, this is fucking crazy.
[69:00.58]They're not fucking around.
[69:03.98]It took until, like, the Dark Souls 3 DLC before you got a boss like this.
[69:07.70]Alright, let's see.
[69:11.57]Oil, fire.
[69:17.83]I feel like I should... I'm gonna, like, waste these here.
[69:20.37]This dude is a full-on wall.
[69:23.63]Uh, well, I need...
[69:25.99]I'm just gonna go in the inventory and take these because the game pauses.
[69:28.55]And having too much shit on my bar always fucks me up.
[69:38.56]Let me see how this goes.
[69:39.52]Let me see how oil works on him.
[69:57.56]There are hooks all around for the scream.
[69:59.66]Yeah, but it happens so quickly that it's almost difficult.
[70:01.44]You kind of rip the camera and like, find a tree!
[70:04.82]He knocks the trees down too, doesn't he?
[70:07.96]Just kind of have to turn and just do it.
[70:10.13]Man, alright, here we go.
[70:10.99]That missed.
[70:18.65]Went right over his head.
[70:23.66]Alright, here we go.
[70:24.90]Covered?
[70:28.47]Wiggle?
[70:28.65]I just want to see if he's dubbing them.
[70:30.17]Okay, you only get to do it once if he's coming at work.
[70:45.26]One thing I don't know about oil, does oil have to be applied every time?
[70:49.06]Or is it just on him?
[70:50.14]That's unreliable.
[71:04.39]Nah, that's very unreliable.
[71:10.55]You gotta get, like, the perfect opportunity.
[71:23.57]Don't do it.
[71:31.51]No, that was not... No, don't do it.
[71:35.27]Is it enough?
[71:37.82]Thank god.
[71:56.41]Man in the corner.
[72:06.94]Oh, here we go.
[72:17.82]Wiggle wiggle.
[72:19.12]Burn him.
[72:22.44]Oh, right, we can do it twice.
[72:29.83]Shit, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.
[72:38.20]Alright, here comes the shift.
[72:41.02]Mist.
[73:04.13]Alright, five heals.
[73:06.77]Let's go.
[73:07.49]Come on.
[73:08.79]Bring this fucking giant Donkey Kong asshole into the grave.
[73:14.98]Alright, here we go.
[73:15.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[73:16.72]Let's make this quick.
[73:17.82]Let's get some shit.
[73:18.72]Okay, passifying agent.
[73:22.44]And I think I'm going to take like a cookie here.
[73:24.36]I don't know.
[73:26.80]I think I'm just going to... How long do these last?
[73:29.89]Attack power, vitality damage...
[73:37.71]What do these fucking things do?
[73:47.61]They last for like 15 seconds.
[73:50.89]It's not long enough.
[73:53.99]I'll wait till he gets up and I'm gonna do... Ah, fuck.
[73:59.06]Shit.
[74:01.38]I gotta get a plan here.
[74:04.13]I'm going to use a... Okay, I don't know.
[74:07.89]I'm going to use the... I'm just going in hard.
[74:12.29]You ready?
[74:13.43]No.
[74:17.89]Vitality damage for... No.
[74:22.99]No, take it off.
[74:23.67]A take?
[74:27.55]I'm already panicking.
[74:28.41]Okay, I'm going to take this one.
[74:31.04]This one.
[74:31.70]Attack sugar.
[74:32.44]Let's go.
[74:33.99]Here we go!
[74:35.13]Go!
[74:37.11]Mistake!
[74:40.11]Mistake!
[74:42.91]Mistakes!
[74:53.40]What the fuck is that move?
[74:59.94]Die you!
[75:04.17]What do I do?
[75:04.81]What do I do?
[75:11.43]Oh my god, I can't see.
[75:12.41]The water is fucking me up.
[75:22.58]No, wrong, wrong, wrong!
[75:32.48]Alright.
[75:44.99]What happened?
[75:47.43]What the fuck is going on?
[76:05.22]I don't... Oh, fuck.
[76:08.28]Jesus!
[76:50.88]AAH!
[77:04.70]AY!
[77:18.19]No!
[77:18.57]No!
[77:18.71]There was no... That fucking camera, man!
[77:20.67]You see what I'm talking about?
[77:21.75]Give me a break!
[77:22.45]That's so hard to do that!
[77:26.05]It's so difficult to find a little spot.
[77:28.60]It really is.
[77:30.58]It's fucking ridiculous.
[77:41.88]See?
[77:42.23]It's like, where the fuck can I even grab from here?
[77:48.63]I don't even want to get close to him.
[77:50.97]One more of those and I'm fucking dead.
[77:57.53]I gotta stay near like a tree.
[78:14.98]Get out!
[78:15.46]Get out!
[78:16.02]Get out!
[78:16.60]Get out!
[78:38.17]Fuck!
[78:38.31]No, fuck.
[78:38.53]That was a different combo.
[78:39.15]Okay, come on.
[78:39.45]I got this shit.
[78:52.79]Let's go.
[79:16.48]Oh no!
[79:33.07]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!
[79:42.60]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!
[80:14.27]Out, out, out, out!
[80:31.04]OH SHIT!
[80:31.96]I GOT NOWHERE TO GO!
[80:34.20]I have to take it!
[80:46.93]No!
[80:47.49]God damn it!
[80:48.39]This is INSANE!
[80:50.01]OH NO!
[80:54.09]This is so- I had it too, it's just so awkward!
[80:57.29]And I got no more pacifying agents!
[81:06.13]Oh my god, he's incredibly fucking difficult.
[81:10.55]God damn it!
[81:11.95]Oh, I have no more pa- God damn it!
[81:16.06]You can hold run- I know, it's just, it's so- I just- It's real easy to say, oh, you can just do this, you can just do that.
[81:24.22]When you're in the fucking driver's seat, when you're in the- when you're piling the airplane, it's a lot harder- a lot easier said than done.
[81:38.88]I'm gonna do this shit again.
[81:39.74]I feel like I was fighting him in that other phase for like fucking 45 minutes.
[81:46.24]Bad run already.
[81:48.88]No, kill me because it's bad already.
[82:02.25]Just kill me!
[82:09.36]I had it too, so close.
[82:11.38]You just gotta parry that string when he's in that second phase.
[82:15.00]Those weird, awkward thrusting, and then he does the big one overhead.
[82:21.38]And then you get the free hits, but fuck man, you gotta do that so many times.
[82:24.38]I feel like I'm not even doing any damage to him.
[82:31.57]Out of pacifying agent, I'm gonna have to buy some.
[82:45.61]I really think I might have to start drinking.
[82:50.83]It'll like, loosen me up a little, I think.
[82:52.42]Because right now, I'm like... I'm like fucking tilted right now.
[82:59.74]I'm not even angry, just like, fuck, man.
[83:03.96]Everything's gonna be so perfect.
[83:14.44]Yeah, I don't know guys.
[83:18.88]I might have to take a second here.
[83:20.10]I've been here for like 45 straight minutes.
[83:35.25]I feel like I have to beat him here though.
[83:40.85]Man, this is, I'm, uh, man.
[83:43.41]Man, oh man.
[83:44.93]Man, okay, I gotta just be clean.
[83:46.48]Alright, if I die again, I'm going, I'm popping the bottle of wine.
[83:58.42]And if I beat him, I'm popping the bottle of wine anyway.
[84:01.53]For victory.
[84:05.51]Where am I?
[84:10.32]Alright, just be easy, play it smart.
[84:12.64]I know all his woos at this point.
[84:24.54]Dammit.
[84:24.76]This is shaky.
[84:42.31]You can hit him so many times with fire.
[85:00.93]What?
[85:01.17]I parried every single one of them.
[85:06.67]Like somewhere underneath.
[85:21.25]Got hit right like a sack.
[85:35.13]But I get there with at least, like, three or four.
[85:38.26]And I got, like, the dodge frame.
[85:41.12]Why even have a dodge?
[85:42.30]Why even tell me to dodge grabs when the iframes for dodging grabs is none?
[85:51.09]Why even have that tutorial?
[85:58.89]No.
[86:00.23]Man, I'm about to go fucking pop the bottle of wine.
[86:02.94]It's the only way this is gonna be possible.
[86:05.38]We'll be here for the next six hours.
[86:06.44]Ah, he broke my posture too.
[86:13.12]I feel weak.
[86:14.06]I feel like I should be doing more damage to him or something.
[86:18.15]The second phase I was hitting so many times.
[86:21.19]I feel so fucking weak right now.
[86:40.09]Alright, this should take him down.
[86:50.82]Sure.
[87:01.55]I didn't... That went wrong.
[87:04.03]Fuck you.
[87:06.02]That, like, 180 degree insta-turn into grab.
[87:18.92]I thought that leaf was a person.
[87:20.17]And I was like, how did somebody get down there?
[87:33.30]I got one healing potion left.
[87:35.46]This is getting bad.
[87:36.60]I just gotta parry everything and then run away.
[87:46.23]No healing potions.
[87:47.81]No pacifying agents.
[87:50.25]Just parry everything and run.
[87:53.03]I'm gonna try.
[87:58.10]Sugar?
[87:58.38]Sugar doesn't seem to last long enough to... Alright, here we go.
[88:05.68]Oh no, I forgot.
[88:06.96]It's okay.
[88:07.36]I don't know why I didn't get hit by that.
[88:08.96]He stopped mid swinging.
[88:10.48]Did you see that?
[88:13.76]That was really weird.
[88:15.04]He was doing his animation here and decided to do something else.
[88:24.83]Without the good view of that, it's hard to do.
[88:34.50]This is gonna be really bad.
[88:36.32]I'm fucked.
[88:52.25]I gotta get out of here.
[88:54.77]What the hell was that?
[89:00.13]There he goes, a big sweep.
[89:04.57]I'm so afraid of this terror thing at this point.
[89:10.79]I tried to hit- I tried to grapple it, and you see how it happened.
[89:14.09]Think of the top right.
[89:14.97]That's gonna do it.
[89:16.47]Just act out out of frame.
[89:17.31]You can hear me pressing the buttons here.
[89:44.01]He's cutting trees down too.
[90:08.65]Come here.
[90:18.67]No!
[90:18.97]I'm too scared to fucking do anything, man!
[90:38.27]I'll do it.
[90:38.62]I don't care if it takes me 30 minutes.
[91:07.74]What?
[91:07.90]I don't know!
[91:08.72]Oh, shit!
[91:10.20]Okay, calm down.
[91:37.99]What the fuck?
[91:39.63]Wow, okay, that's all sweeps.
[91:51.22]If you miss the first one, that's such a weird little place to go.
[91:54.60]He does a little turn, and if you miss the first one, you're fucked.
[91:58.97]You gotta be close, but get him.
[92:00.41]Man, this just takes forever.
[92:19.67]You can do four.
[92:20.83]You can do four.
[92:31.57]That's a bad... That's a mistake.
[92:32.81]Don't do it like that.
[92:36.31]Coming up.
[92:52.28]Oh, shit!
[92:53.07]Oh, fuck!
[92:53.59]Whoa, he stopped mid-animation, you asshole!
[92:57.51]What a dick!
[93:09.76]Dude, motherfucker, that was so ridiculous!
[93:15.95]Sometimes he changes that combo in the middle.
[93:19.51]I am gonna have to tell you guys something here right now, okay?
[93:22.89]I'm ready to take this.
[93:26.07]I'm ready to take this.
[93:28.11]In fact, I'm ready to take this.
[93:30.25]Here it comes.
[93:45.26]No!
[94:11.14]Bring it on.
[94:20.05]That's positioning.
[94:23.11]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh.
[94:38.22]Oh my god, I fucked it up over here.
[94:50.44]It's time.
[95:13.72]It's time to take it.
[95:20.83]Fuck it.
[95:34.93]He does it.
[96:03.63]Pull it up!
[96:06.61]Oh!
[96:09.31]Kill him!
[96:10.12]Kill him, please!
[96:11.64]Take the worm out!
[96:19.49]Don't get up again.
[96:20.13]He better not get up again.
[96:21.53]If he gets up again, I'm quitting the game.
[96:27.00]I heard the scream.
[96:31.30]Oh my god.
[96:32.74]That was fucking ridiculous.
[96:34.82]When they throw the second face shit at you, you just... You gotta redo the whole... You gotta relearn the whole fight twice.
[96:39.98]Oh, man.
[96:45.29]Hey, I told you.
[96:46.27]Win or lose.
[96:50.29]How many attempts was that?
[96:51.13]That was a lot of attempts.
[96:57.49]Slender finger.
[97:03.57]Empty the cupboards on the- ah, it's time for a glass of wine.
[97:07.64]So, the slender finger of a young woman can be fitted to the prosthetic to create a prosthetic tool.
[97:15.17]Found in the belly of the guardian ape, it is partially digested.
[97:18.30]There's a shinobi technique called the Finger Whistle that can drive beasts wild.
[97:24.48]The one who used it before clearly used it for this purpose, as evidenced by the finger's open hole.
[97:31.04]And let's read the- I got- okay, now I can do what I wanted to do.
[97:35.75]Oh, man.
[97:36.61]That shit is fucking- that's fucking crazy.
[97:44.71]I want to read the thing that I just got.
[97:51.68]Where is it?
[97:52.50]Here it is.
[97:53.70]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[97:57.76]Commune with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase attack power.
[98:01.75]The guardian ape was defeated, though its roar can still be heard.
[98:04.79]It is said that an infested body marks the undying.
[98:15.95]Enhance attack power.
[98:18.99]Let's go.
[98:24.05]But such a long life would surely be quite lonesome for even an ape.
[98:26.96]Perhaps the echoing roar of the guardian ape was in fact a solicitation of sorts.
[98:37.82]Sweat check?
[98:38.42]I'm not wearing any clothes.
[98:42.61]I'll put a t-shirt on and I'll get the bottle of wine though.
[98:45.67]Do I have a blind opener?
[98:47.15]I don't think I even do.
[98:49.74]I've not had a blind opener.
[98:53.72]Since moving to this place.
[98:57.62]Alright, there it is, finally.
[99:00.18]Recovers vitality upon performing a successful death blow.
[99:04.42]Uh, yeah.
[99:13.69]Now we're in business.
[99:16.30]I still do want this.
[99:22.71]And I got these two.
[99:23.91]I think I want these as well.
[99:28.03]Your face can't turn on the entire time.
[99:29.51]Alright, hold on.
[99:32.53]I'll be right back.
[99:33.89]Let me go see how hard this is going to be to do.
[103:14.32]Honest to God, I will never understand why I am the way that I am.
[103:19.46]You know, sometimes you just think about that.
[103:20.54]There are like four bottles of wine in this house.
[103:25.43]There's no way to open them.
[103:27.75]I just keep adding to my collection.
[103:30.93]Oh, that sounds good.
[103:33.09]They're corked.
[103:33.67]I can't open them.
[103:35.31]I never get a wine opener.
[103:36.85]I just keep adding to my pantry of wines.
[103:45.29]You can't use a knife.
[103:46.44]You'll fuck it up.
[103:48.56]But, it's alright.
[103:50.18]We'll do the next best thing.
[103:51.72]That's a cider.
[103:53.76]So, here we go.
[103:54.46]Cheers, everybody.
[103:55.68]Turn on the camera.
[103:57.80]Like 30 seconds.
[104:05.77]Oh.
[104:07.11]My camera's unplugged.
[104:10.09]Why is the camera on?
[104:12.27]Who fucking did this?
[104:15.00]Who did this?
[104:16.38]I didn't do this.
[104:17.20]Somebody came in here and did this.
[104:18.73]I didn't do it.
[104:19.29]Is this it?
[104:40.81]What?
[104:41.15]Where?
[104:41.73]It just magically disappeared?
[104:44.27]Where's the USB plug for this?
[104:47.49]What the what?
[104:50.43]It's just gone.
[104:51.23]Don't ever have a computer.
[105:04.94]Ever.
[105:07.70]Only read newspapers, do crosswords, and use your phone.
[105:15.20]Alright, here we go.
[105:20.10]Alright, guys.
[105:32.70]Cheers, everybody!
[105:34.22]This is a cider.
[105:39.96]That was fucking insane.
[105:43.76]This game's crazy.
[105:50.30]Drinking at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[105:51.64]It's 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[105:53.48]Therefore, it's legal.
[105:54.75]It's legal now.
[105:55.95]I can do it now.
[106:03.69]I need a minute after that.
[106:07.27]I need to go on like a light jog after that one.
[106:12.70]What's wrong with your sideburns?
[106:13.60]They're always fucked up.
[106:14.38]I have like a misshapen face.
[106:16.14]So they're never going to be correct.
[106:17.30]Sorry.
[106:24.69]It's pretty good.
[106:27.57]No wine, though.
[106:28.89]I can't have wine.
[106:38.79]I look lovely?
[106:39.87]Thank you.
[106:41.47]What's going on here?
[106:44.54]What's going on here?
[106:45.24]OK, I thought hair just fell out, but it was actually on the screen.
[106:51.29]Why don't you do facecam?
[106:52.21]Always have facecam on.
[106:53.25]Dude, you'll get like more viewers!
[107:02.56]That's why we turned it off.
[107:16.11]Alright, back to the game.
[107:28.40]So who's my favorite boss so far?
[107:31.38]For those of you that have gotten this far and played this far, probably Genichiro.
[107:36.64]That one felt the most... That one felt the most involved for me.
[107:44.21]A giant gorilla throwing shit at you.
[107:46.81]I mean, this was cool.
[107:52.74]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[107:58.71]Typical Saul's camera, right guy.
[108:00.61]Oh, look at that.
[108:01.37]Sorry.
[108:03.39]Complain, complain, complain.
[108:04.47]Alright, can I ask you, how many of you guys have watched other streamers play this game?
[108:11.80]Maybe a bunch of you?
[108:16.28]What's percentage-wise?
[108:17.55]Okay, let's say, well, not percentage, but where do I fit in, like, the streamer complains about the video game and is, like, angry at the video game?
[108:25.37]Where do I sit there?
[108:28.05]You know, let's say 1 is streamer didn't do it at all, and 10 is streamer is so obnoxious with how much they're talking about how the game's not good, and how it's- the game is hard and it's too hard, and I hate this game, it's stupid, the mechanics are dumb.
[108:44.38]Like, where do I sit there?
[108:51.19]A 4?
[108:52.15]About a 4?
[108:52.43]Okay.
[108:53.59]Alright, I'm- I'm alright with a 4.
[109:03.65]Keep me honest, though.
[109:04.47]If I get over a five, if we get to, like, six territory, you guys gotta let me know.
[109:13.22]I don't wanna get to six territory.
[109:17.07]Get it off the screen!
[109:24.11]Alright.
[109:24.43]A white lotus flower found blooming in the depths of the sunken valley where the fountainhead waters pool deeply.
[109:29.99]The flower's aroma attracts female apes.
[109:32.55]Thus, the guardian ape carefully tended to it so as to offer it to his bride.
[109:37.47]One of the incense ingredients sought by the divine air for immortal severance.
[109:40.96]That's kind of sad.
[109:45.22]Well, I have the lotus.
[109:46.86]I can now go talk to the kid.
[109:50.66]And we can continue to progress.
[109:53.12]Nothing up there, right?
[109:56.74]How could you?
[109:57.50]Well, I needed his soul.
[109:59.94]I needed increased attack power.
[110:02.82]Look, he was like suffering down here for like 4,000 years.
[110:07.44]But wait.
[110:08.80]Don't ever just leave an area without checking.
[110:10.76]You know, there could be something over here.
[110:23.77]Nothing?
[110:27.70]Aww, really?
[110:32.92]He's sad.
[110:33.86]What the fuck?
[110:37.46]What's wrong with some of you guys?
[110:43.77]Um, let's just go back.
[110:53.39]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[110:59.55]Thank you for the five community subs.
[111:01.78]Again.
[111:04.46]Thank you.
[111:09.74]Coming in with the five subs.
[111:12.72]Alright, so I got the flower now.
[111:13.80]I have to go put the flower, talk to the kid.
[111:19.36]He's in the library, right?
[111:20.56]Is he still in here?
[111:22.24]I got the flower.
[111:25.94]my lord I've procured the flower for the fountainhead aroma oh was it truly blooming in the sunken valley yeah deep within the valley so that is where the fountainhead waters pooled deeply you've done well to acquire this wolf oh and actually I found something I discovered there's another scent we need another one what is it the blood of the divine heir of the dragon's heritage in other words
[111:57.75]What, I gotta kill him?
[112:03.31]Whoa, I just, like, fucking went down in my seat.
[112:06.26]I want to lock this fucking thing.
[112:20.16]There we go.
[112:21.34]Page's diary, an old diary entry written by Takeru's page.
[112:25.17]Lord Takeru held his arm over the incense burner and attempted to cut it with a sword, but incredibly, his wound healed instantly, and not a drop of blood was shed.
[112:35.55]Lady Tomoe said, without it, your blood cannot be spilled.
[112:38.70]What could she be referring to?
[112:40.70]I wonder.
[112:41.36]Now then, we just need to figure out how to make me bleed.
[112:45.54]Perhaps we should ask Lady Emma.
[112:48.79]Let me ask you this.
[112:51.55]Do you bleed?
[112:53.21]Let me ask you this.
[113:02.39]Do you bleed?
[113:05.38]Let me ask you this, Superman.
[113:07.96]Do you bleed?
[113:09.70]I gotta get it right.
[113:13.34]Let me ask you something, Superman.
[113:16.84]Do you bleed?
[113:19.38]Perfect.
[113:26.08]Emma, Emma, Emma.
[113:29.04]There is something I would like to ask you.
[113:30.58]I'm reaching a six out loud.
[113:31.80]What is it?
[113:32.98]The sakura tree behind the castle.
[113:35.24]You mean the ever blossom.
[113:37.30]It is a sakura tree that Lord Takeru brought from his homeland.
[113:42.21]So it's a sakura tree from the divine realm.
[113:45.25]Yes.
[113:46.49]It's quite a mysterious one at that.
[113:48.61]Sounds mysterious.
[113:49.25]It was constantly in bloom, even outside of spring.
[113:53.44]However, the ever blossom.
[113:56.96]Poison Swamp Town?
[113:57.98]Oh, I can't wait.
[113:58.78]He stole it.
[113:59.08]That would be there.
[114:00.42]Oh.
[114:17.96]I have the monkey drink, right?
[114:19.44]What's the title of this stream?
[114:20.28]I don't remember what it was.
[114:21.38]I can't see it from here.
[114:22.24]Oh, right, right, right.
[114:22.78]I mean, that's kind of true.
[114:51.93]Alright, so we're going to Poison Swamp.
[114:55.08]Can't wait.
[114:59.72]Anything else I can do?
[115:00.48]What do I have for, uh... What'd she say?
[115:12.17]Lord Dekaru brought it here from the Divine Realm, but it has withered away.
[115:15.83]I wonder if I should give the prosthetic guy the monkey booze.
[115:19.00]However, it is said that someone plucked a branch from the Everblossom and stole off with it.
[115:26.22]Who would do such a thing?
[115:28.24]Some fucking loser.
[115:30.18]What's lost is lost.
[115:32.38]Finding a stolen tree branch?
[115:34.92]We have no information to go on.
[115:37.24]Let us gather what we can for the aroma first.
[115:41.84]Whatever, you fucking loser.
[115:48.07]Why doesn't the Souls team make like a Boston guy for like... Never mind.
[115:53.41]I gotta dial the weird back a little bit.
[115:58.76]Uh, okay.
[116:00.58]Well, let's go back to where we were.
[116:06.26]So this is... Let's just go back to the watering hole and go up from there.
[116:17.64]Drunk off of one cider.
[116:18.92]I've had a sip and a half of cider.
[116:22.95]Logically speaking, and scientifically speaking, what you are describing is not possible.
[116:30.17]Okay?
[116:32.45]It's not physically possible.
[116:35.11]Can I get back up?
[116:42.06]It's this way, right?
[116:47.52]Can't get up there?
[116:49.76]We'll just go to the... Isn't there an idol right here?
[116:51.90]I'm weighing less than... I weigh like 152.
[116:56.18]Give it a rest.
[117:04.99]Is it this one?
[117:13.89]Yes.
[117:16.13]So, here we go.
[117:17.41]Can I go... Can I jump to anything?
[117:23.76]Kind of.
[117:31.75]We're just gonna keep going down.
[117:32.89]Um... Yep.
[117:41.31]It's a poison swamp.
[117:42.97]I don't know why they keep making these.
[117:46.91]At this point, it's an inside joke, right?
[117:48.95]It's a joke.
[117:52.67]This is them just making a joke.
[117:58.13]There's no way that they do this again.
[118:03.43]This is specifically to make people like me angry.
[118:12.48]Why?
[118:13.06]Really?
[118:13.38]We've done this like six times!
[118:16.20]The sludge, you can't go that fast, the poison, like... Okay, hold on a minute.
[118:22.94]They've done fire level, lava level.
[118:26.17]They've done ice level.
[118:28.83]Poison level too much.
[118:30.83]Why don't you do like a celestial level or something?
[118:36.81]Get us like onto the rainbow road and go to outer space or something.
[118:46.08]It's their signature at this point.
[118:49.06]Well, their signature's a fucking mess.
[118:50.70]I can't even read it.
[118:57.17]It's just like, Scribble, whatever!
[118:58.87]Who cares?
[118:59.45]Just give me my... What'd you tip?
[119:02.13]Oh, 6%.
[119:03.89]What a dick.
[119:07.65]What?
[119:07.99]My hamburger was a little undercooked.
[119:09.88]You're a dick.
[119:12.64]Is this guy gonna do something?
[119:23.02]Ooh, ooh, that's a lot of swings.
[119:24.86]Back it up.
[119:35.64]Oh, fuck.
[119:37.60]Break him.
[119:38.02]6% is a lot.
[119:38.32]A 6% tip is not a big tip. 6%?
[119:57.60]6% is like... the server didn't refill your water one time.
[120:03.32]She came over and said that your shirt looks ugly.
[120:09.10]And was visibly drunk at work.
[120:22.07]Alright, so let's go here.
[120:29.45]Alright, I will tell you.
[120:30.25]Okay, I'll give you one.
[120:31.45]I'm going to dial back my poison swamp stupid thing.
[120:35.37]Because at least I can jump from tree to tree here.
[120:40.44]It's not totally awful.
[120:44.22]Yeah, okay.
[120:44.96]This is not that bad.
[120:45.66]Alright, we got two.
[120:47.76]I'm going to sneak up behind here, I think.
[120:51.62]That's not gonna happen.
[120:52.48]Never mind.
[120:53.90]And there's another one.
[120:57.03]There's the other one.
[120:59.05]That was a gun.
[121:07.13]Fuck.
[121:07.45]This one should- I gotta get the person with the gun.
[121:16.87]You will fuck this whole thing up.
[121:27.12]Alright, now one-on-one.
[121:28.68]Nope, there's a guy with a gun down there.
[121:29.86]Get out of the poison.
[121:35.24]Out of the poison.
[121:35.82]Out, out, out.
[121:36.56]Don't want to stay in here for that long.
[121:39.61]Please.
[121:41.03]Out.
[121:41.25]Alright, thank god.
[121:44.07]Alright, up here, you and me, one-on-one.
[121:45.17]Let's go.
[121:47.08]You're the hard one.
[121:55.51]Ooh, you didn't like that, did you?
[122:17.71]Oh, he's going to break my posture.
[122:18.91]Fuck.
[122:19.45]These guys are rough.
[122:24.13]He just parried me.
[122:41.94]There it is.
[122:42.32]Come on.
[122:42.70]Whoa, he's going to kill me.
[122:50.57]Damn!
[122:55.64]What happened?
[122:56.26]Community subs?
[123:01.66]I just missed out.
[123:02.40]I was focusing.
[123:03.12]Sorry.
[123:03.82]It was intense.
[123:04.96]What, uh, who gave the community subs?
[123:10.03]10 community subs!
[123:10.61]Damn.
[123:14.15]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[123:15.71]You are just coming in hot with subs.
[123:17.67]Ever since I played Minecraft VR on stream.
[123:24.82]Thank you.
[123:35.46]I need to start using these.
[123:36.88]I just... I have so much trouble.
[123:41.24]I can't help it.
[123:42.06]I did the same thing in Resident Evil 2.
[123:43.52]You can saw me play through that.
[123:46.06]Any item that looks even remotely useful, I can't use it.
[123:49.34]Because it's so useful that I don't want it to use... I don't want to use it.
[123:57.90]It's too useful!
[124:01.73]Okay, so... Where do I go from here?
[124:06.15]This way?
[124:10.31]I guess we're gonna wrap around here.
[124:15.25]It's not useful when you don't do anything when it does nothing.
[124:17.73]I know, it's bad!
[124:19.83]I agree with you completely.
[124:20.87]Alright, looks like we're going that way.
[124:32.35]Give me up.
[124:34.49]Okay.
[124:36.46]Oh.
[124:37.38]Something over here.
[124:43.26]NPC, maybe?
[124:44.19]Or mini-boss?
[124:45.31]Probably somebody in the hut?
[124:46.39]Yeah, somebody in here.
[124:49.53]Oh.
[124:55.97]Where you find the departed, you find the memorial mob.
[125:03.44]Even in places where people simply drift along.
[125:17.70]Hmm.
[125:19.32]Well, pellets are very useful.
[125:21.60]I should probably get as many of those as I can afford.
[125:24.82]Ah, yellow gunpowder.
[125:25.96]That all you got?
[125:27.22]Green mossy gourd.
[125:30.85]Refills upon rest.
[125:33.69]It doesn't heal poison status.
[125:35.27]It reduces poison buildup and increases poison resistance.
[125:40.61]Another gourd, huh?
[125:42.62]How much money do I have?
[125:43.38]I have one dollar.
[125:50.01]That sucks.
[125:53.49]I have 1,000.
[125:53.89]I have 1,100.
[125:54.35]God damn it.
[126:01.30]Well.
[126:07.36]I don't have enough money.
[126:13.77]Go this way.
[126:17.29]So this is that way?
[126:18.07]I'm gonna go down.
[126:18.69]Let's see what's down here.
[126:29.01]I don't like this already.
[126:36.70]Hmm?
[126:41.12]Uh... huh?
[126:42.76]Apparently there's something here.
[126:44.94]I have to react immediately.
[126:54.10]Uh, ghosts in the walls?
[126:57.20]Or rock people?
[127:04.32]Okay.
[127:17.25]Even further down?
[127:20.27]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[127:22.21]Okay, it's...
[127:29.16]That was scary.
[127:31.15]Is there something I need to do here?
[127:33.45]I think I'm... I don't know.
[127:37.51]It's just... Should I sneak?
[127:40.55]Oh, fuck you.
[127:45.01]Come on.
[127:45.87]Do it again.
[127:47.09]No, you're just annoying.
[127:51.43]Jesus!
[127:58.77]I'm trying to... I'm trying to catch it.
[128:01.17]Just go.
[128:15.16]Ash.
[128:18.54]I feel like I'm wandering into something.
[128:19.90]I shouldn't be here.
[128:21.32]Wait, I just heard him.
[128:22.18]Does he know I'm here?
[128:22.74]He knows.
[128:23.56]Oh, that was a very bad move.
[128:24.56]I don't understand.
[128:25.20]Okay, hold on.
[128:25.62]Sneak under here.
[128:38.60]It's all poison in there.
[128:40.81]What the fuck?
[128:41.63]I didn't see him.
[128:45.57]I'm fucking poisoned.
[128:46.63]Alright, get me the... How many geckos are in here?
[129:06.02]What?
[129:07.12]What?
[129:07.42]It's...
[129:09.40]I don't... I'm getting indicators in every direction.
[129:14.08]There's a lot of them in here.
[129:19.82]Oh, fuck off.
[129:22.68]I don't want to accidentally hit the snake.
[129:26.32]You little punks, stop it!
[129:33.42]Is there anything even in here?
[129:34.30]Uh... Now what?
[129:45.79]I'm stuck.
[129:46.31]Am I s- I don't- am I gonna do the thing?
[130:14.98]The thing that I made the joke about that wasn't even real?
[130:19.28]Oh shit, look at all that.
[130:29.17]I gotta get across.
[130:32.37]Who's over there?
[130:36.49]Can I jump on him?
[130:49.01]I don't know where I ended up.
[130:49.96]Where am I?
[130:52.32]I don't know where I am.
[130:54.46]Where the fuck am I?
[130:58.07]I'm gonna die.
[130:58.65]This is... I'm wasting so many of these.
[131:03.48]Where...
[131:07.73]You know, I wish instead of just teleporting you to a random spot, because it's so easy to get lost, I wish they would just do the Mario Kart thing if you fall off and Lakitu comes over and pulls you up.
[131:16.83]You know what I mean?
[131:17.27]Like, I don't even know where the hell it even put me.
[131:18.55]It went to a black screen and I teleported to a random place on the map.
[131:22.42]At the very beginning?
[131:26.20]Oh, that sucks.
[131:38.38]I'm just gonna run.
[131:43.04]Get through here.
[131:43.66]Watch out, there's a guy right in the corner, right over here.
[131:47.38]Watch out.
[131:51.74]Don't ask me how you're still alive.
[131:57.95]Now, can I get up this way?
[131:59.69]Because that's where the items are.
[132:04.05]What?
[132:04.55]Come on.
[132:05.95]Really?
[132:08.62]How is that?
[132:09.16]How am I not grabbing onto this shit?
[132:24.95]Is there something I can do from here?
[132:31.49]What?
[132:33.87]Ah.
[132:37.79]Ooh.
[132:41.62]Watch out, it's gonna be like DUN!
[132:44.86]Oh, scrap.
[132:54.26]I guess it's... It's the snake boss, isn't it?
[133:06.08]No, not another one of these scenarios where I have to hide!
[133:09.40]No!
[133:19.99]Well... I mean, I can go there, but can I make that jump?
[133:28.28]But after I make the jump, where do I go from there?
[133:32.85]Um... Is there anything to grab?
[133:59.68]Okay, but that's not possible what about I can't grab anything
[134:16.72]There's nothing to grab there.
[134:18.05]Wow!
[134:26.03]I didn't know this was here!
[134:27.21]I didn't know this was here.
[134:29.41]Um... Oh, shit.
[134:43.03]It's a guy with a frying pan, isn't it?
[134:48.97]No, he was hiding from a snake too.
[134:51.35]I'm sorry.
[134:53.11]I'm sorry.
[134:53.86]I didn't... I didn't mean to, but I did.
[134:57.84]Alright.
[135:01.28]Up and then sneak?
[135:06.19]That's it.
[135:06.63]I have to do this.
[135:26.16]Okay.
[135:28.66]Well, that's unfortunate.
[135:36.72]Where the fuck am I supposed to go then?
[135:38.93]Not down there.
[135:41.17]There was another place I could go.
[135:50.45]I was trying to grab onto something.
[135:54.61]Oh well.
[135:54.95]It's okay.
[135:56.39]Fuck, that hurt.
[136:06.85]Here we go.
[136:07.29]Noooo!
[136:18.25]Yeah, fuck the fighting.
[136:19.59]Just get me to where I was before.
[136:24.31]There's that way, but there's also this way.
[136:28.07]I can go over here.
[136:34.21]Up this?
[136:35.11]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[136:35.97]Around the corner.
[136:38.01]That's down into the pit again.
[136:48.20]Up here?
[136:50.30]I think?
[136:51.84]What do you mean I can't grab it?
[136:52.88]What do you mean Barks has bite?
[136:56.05]What do you mean Barks has bite?
[136:57.85]What do you mean Barks has bite?
[137:00.43]Johnny!
[137:00.65]What do you mean Barks has bite?
[137:12.10]Up?
[137:15.48]Um... Where the hell do I go?
[137:18.97]Do I have to go down this way?
[137:21.01]Am I just going the direction I just came from?
[137:30.34]Yeah.
[137:33.76]Because this just wraps around.
[137:35.26]Unless I can go over here.
[137:46.61]Doesn't look like it.
[137:57.28]Huh.
[137:58.83]I guess I have to go to Snake.
[138:05.09]I thought maybe there'd be a way to go down here.
[138:06.57]I don't think there's any other way to go.
[138:19.74]No.
[138:20.60]Snake it is, apparently.
[138:23.93]or did I open I don't think I opened up in the area after the gorilla um hold on oh no no no I don't want to fight this guy
[138:53.92]to the snake, but snake instantly kills me.
[138:59.38]And then... Can I not reach this?
[139:03.59]Oh, come on.
[139:15.10]I'm just gonna bone the hell out of here.
[139:27.89]Alright, let me look at the... Let me look at the bonfires.
[139:39.21]So, wait, I have a new prosthetic.
[139:46.42]Hello.
[139:46.58]Okay.
[139:47.10]So this is the finger whistle.
[139:47.88]Divine abduction.
[140:19.19]Can I finger whistle the snake?
[140:22.96]Its sound will grab an enemy's attention and draw them to the whistle's location.
[140:26.84]By locking onto a target, only the targeted enemy will hear the whistle.
[140:32.70]I can't be like... Enrageous beasts, making them unable to discern between friend and foe.
[140:50.04]Well, there it is.
[140:50.58]Okay, I need to do this first if I want to do better firecrackers.
[141:05.76]Try figuring the monkey that's hiding behind the snake.
[141:09.45]Will that scare the monkey?
[141:22.17]This guy's dying.
[141:24.01]Shit.
[141:30.19]How many of those things do I have?
[141:34.91]Do you have any more stuff to buy?
[141:36.07]No.
[141:37.97]You have a lot of pellets.
[141:43.25]Okay.
[141:48.07]Let me see.
[141:50.69]Alright.
[141:51.25]We have...
[141:55.86]Antechamber.
[141:57.08]The dojo.
[141:58.36]The lookout point.
[142:00.36]The old grave.
[142:01.35]The giant serpent shrine.
[142:03.13]The reservoir.
[142:05.51]I think from the reservoir, could I go up?
[142:14.79]Or is it... Maybe the dojo.
[142:22.11]I feel like there was a way to go out here.
[142:26.43]Go check on the training guy.
[142:37.37]Nope, nothing in there.
[142:41.98]He's got no new training or anything.
[142:44.58]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[143:00.75]This is tricky because I think I have to go either here or here.
[143:04.52]What about this place?
[143:08.40]Oh, wait a minute.
[143:08.92]What about the... There's like a guy here, right?
[143:11.28]Isn't there a boss here?
[143:15.60]There's stuff... There's shit down here, too.
[143:27.23]This is new.
[143:31.23]Uh...
[143:50.25]Say hello.
[143:50.55]Hi.
[143:50.69]That's me.
[143:51.01]Is he talking about the magician down here?
[144:22.35]Perhaps I alone can hear it.
[144:27.18]Nothing else matters.
[144:29.28]I must follow that melody.
[144:30.98]That melody calls to me.
[144:33.54]The melody.
[144:36.38]I must... That melody... How might I pursue it?
[144:41.34]I don't... I don't know.
[144:42.38]Is that so?
[144:43.36]Then please, I'd like to listen to it.
[144:46.88]There's a melody... There's a song down here.
[144:48.98]There's a melody down here.
[144:55.86]Oh, wait a minute.
[144:56.62]This part.
[145:00.16]What?
[145:02.48]Ah.
[145:06.89]Right.
[145:07.23]Okay, I remember this now.
[145:13.81]Bye.
[145:21.79]You ain't gonna throw me off here.
[145:24.42]Ah, that was death.
[145:25.22]I would have died right there.
[145:27.76]Thank God I got the intuition of a goddamn leopard.
[145:37.71]Now what?
[145:40.41]Now what do I do?
[145:41.05]Down, I guess, over here?
[145:42.15]Ooh.
[145:43.65]Ooh.
[145:46.42]Okay.
[145:52.72]Excuse me?
[146:04.18]Easy enough.
[146:10.18]These are just hollows.
[146:13.02]Ash.
[146:13.28]I've got so much of this.
[146:14.34]Another hole.
[146:31.73]Do I check up here first?
[146:35.32]I feel like there's another way I can look.
[146:38.82]You just killed a homeless guy in a cave.
[146:43.60]Um... No, I didn't.
[146:47.59]Well, yes I did.
[146:48.37]Okay?
[146:49.89]That zombie did not have a home.
[146:52.21]He was walking around aimlessly.
[146:55.25]So yes, that zombie was probably homeless.
[146:58.99]Probably.
[146:59.89]I'm just going.
[147:00.46]Whatever.
[147:04.76]Terror.
[147:06.64]Well.
[147:08.04]Wait.
[147:09.32]Don't.
[147:09.52]Okay.
[147:13.09]I found a new one.
[147:17.51]This was his home.
[147:24.99]Ashina Depths.
[147:27.59]Back to the poison.
[147:29.67]Wonderful.
[147:32.22]Lots of items scattered everywhere.
[147:37.75]Like over there.
[147:38.81]Let's just get that one first.
[147:46.31]Scrap.
[147:46.89]I gotta use this shit.
[147:49.88]Can I make this?
[147:50.76]I think I can kill this guy.
[147:59.72]Well, I thought... I thought... Okay, he can still hit me from here.
[148:08.71]Snake eyes?
[148:09.53]This... Uh... Can... Okay, fine.
[148:28.31]I don't even know who's attacking me.
[148:34.70]Apparently there's a mini-boss down here.
[148:39.34]Uh, somewhere.
[148:40.92]Is it the guy that was right here?
[148:42.12]Is that guy right there?
[148:44.18]I have to kill this dude.
[148:45.82]Like, from the ledge.
[148:46.89]It's very obvious.
[148:55.77]Okay, that's, that's Snake Eyes on the right there.
[148:58.63]He shoots the gun.
[149:05.88]Who else is over here?
[149:06.76]I gotta take a look.
[149:09.01]Before I commit to anything.
[149:10.01]Okay, lots of gunpowder and lots of stuff on the ground.
[149:15.69]Alright, what else we got?
[149:16.41]A guy up there?
[149:20.13]Nope, I ain't doing that.
[149:21.05]Poison and then water.
[149:28.55]Get over here.
[149:29.09]Whoa!
[149:31.79]This is just the item run.
[149:45.89]Wow!
[149:47.01]No fucking way.
[149:53.85]That was unbelievable.
[149:56.29]Okay, I think I got all the items.
[150:00.36]Jesus.
[150:00.90]No!
[150:03.38]I can't... Oh, you can't dodge in the water.
[150:05.96]You can't dodge in the water.
[150:07.38]Great.
[150:22.67]Oh, I fought this lady before.
[150:23.89]It's just one of these.
[150:26.73]But not with a guy raining mortars everywhere.
[150:28.95]There's like three people doing that here.
[150:31.77]Oh my lord, I'm gonna have to go around and kill all of them.
[150:33.89]One by one.
[150:40.55]Jesus.
[150:41.77]This is... I was about to say stupid.
[150:45.22]I was about to.
[150:45.74]Don't say it yet.
[150:46.42]Don't say it.
[150:47.14]I'm at like a three or four right now.
[150:48.46]Don't do it.
[150:57.70]Well, I got the items, so let's try this again.
[151:07.22]Get this one.
[151:07.68]At least just give me all the item.
[151:12.35]And... okay.
[151:15.03]Just... I guess we're gonna do this.
[151:27.18]And give me... I have to put that back on.
[151:32.76]Alright.
[151:40.72]I could go this way, though.
[151:41.90]Let's see what's over here.
[151:44.22]No.
[151:44.40]Alright.
[151:49.82]So, what's up here?
[151:56.35]Is there a guy over here?
[151:57.31]I need to like pull one of these guys.
[152:04.79]But they can just shoot from far away and if I go over here the lady will just see me.
[152:08.52]Maybe I should just backstab the lady and just fight her over here without being seen.
[152:16.92]That's possible, right?
[152:26.02]Who's seeing me now?
[152:26.98]Okay, up top there.
[152:28.50]I gotta deal with that guy first.
[152:33.80]Get out of the stealth, please.
[152:36.31]What?
[152:39.71]This guy's gotta die.
[152:52.42]Oil.
[152:55.47]There's this one.
[152:56.25]Oh, he didn't see me.
[153:01.27]Hmm.
[153:06.85]There's two.
[153:07.49]One there, one there.
[153:08.25]I wonder if it's worth trying to backstab and then... Hmm.
[153:17.26]Try this.
[153:22.56]Does this actually work?
[153:30.62]Can't really lock on.
[153:48.92]Come on.
[153:50.10]Come on.
[153:51.40]You can see me, but I can't see you.
[153:53.08]Come on.
[153:58.32]Kind of just want to see what this does.
[154:05.94]Come on.
[154:07.84]Come on, come investigate.
[154:08.94]What?
[154:09.44]Oh, alright, well.
[154:12.28]Um.
[154:19.95]If I go over there, she's gonna see me.
[154:25.35]If I go over there to fight that, I'm just gonna fight it.
[154:27.16]I'm just gonna backstab this person and just fight.
[154:28.62]I'm just gonna go for it.
[154:34.97]Hopefully I can do a position where I can backstab her and then run back this way without aggroing everybody.
[154:42.85]Does she have line of sight right here?
[154:49.72]Here we go, ready?
[154:51.94]Alright, they can see me, I think.
[154:57.67]Get out of stealth!
[155:01.61]Why am I walking onto that person?
[155:03.07]Alright, here we go.
[155:05.13]Back up this way.
[155:05.75]Alright, how we doing?
[155:15.23]Good?
[155:16.43]I'll fight you right over here.
[155:19.95]Let's go.
[155:23.05]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[155:24.34]No, no, no, no.
[155:24.70]Where'd you go?
[155:28.00]Come on.
[155:30.50]Come on!
[155:32.43]Get over here.
[155:39.04]Good, good, good.
[155:41.60]Alright, I'm getting poison damage though.
[155:43.78]Alright, back it up.
[155:45.18]Right here.
[155:46.28]Let's go.
[155:51.48]Alright.
[155:53.92]One on one.
[155:55.34]Come on in.
[156:06.67]I wonder if, is she taking poison damage right now?
[156:13.41]Yeah, she's poisoned.
[156:19.74]Whoa!
[156:20.20]Oh, it's because I'm in the fucking swamp!
[156:21.88]Oh, that sucks!
[156:23.22]Very bad.
[156:24.46]Very fucking bad.
[156:25.46]I can't dodge.
[156:38.51]This is actually, this was a terrible idea.
[156:49.27]God damn it.
[157:06.19]That move sucks.
[157:20.79]Almost, almost, almost, almost!
[157:31.18]Get out of here!
[157:31.70]Alright, mini-boss done.
[157:37.34]Turned out it was a great idea.
[157:38.36]I just... $85.
[157:38.68]Somebody just gave 85 bucks.
[157:39.76]Hold on.
[157:53.76]Thank you, Tay Dolph Swifler.
[157:55.42]Thank you for the $85.
[158:00.03]That's a lot of fucking money.
[158:04.95]Thank you so much.
[158:06.93]Can you say, wait a minute, hold on.
[158:09.72]Am I paused?
[158:12.78]Okay, yeah.
[158:14.38]They say, hey, Jerma, boot camp sucked since nobody got my Jerma impressions.
[158:19.12]But now that I have some money in my account, I figured I'd show my appreciation with the bits.
[158:23.02]Thanks for all the genuine, heartfelt content you keep putting out, and I look forward to tuning in to future streams.
[158:28.68]It may not mean much coming from me, but I think you're the best streamer on Twitch since you make an honest effort to reach out to your audience.
[158:36.13]Stay great.
[158:38.67]Thank you so much, Tatov.
[158:42.59]It means a lot.
[158:44.35]Don't ever think that that doesn't mean anything.
[158:47.27]You say you may not mean much.
[158:50.49]It means an absolute fuck ton.
[158:56.31]Thank you so goddamn much.
[159:04.80]I wish you the best.
[159:05.46]Thank you for being here.
[159:16.87]If you give me $85 and you don't think that means anything, that's an incredible amount of money to give somebody.
[159:26.74]And with a message like that attached to it, it means a lot.
[159:34.00]Even if you give a dollar, ten cents, it doesn't matter.
[159:38.70]You allow me to do this every day.
[159:39.94]For, you know, four days, five days, whatever.
[159:52.33]Once a week.
[159:54.99]But for real, I... I say it a lot, but it's true.
[160:07.85]I gave you a dollar once.
[160:09.35]And thank you for it.
[160:10.35]Because you don't have to do that.
[160:17.31]It's all optional, which is... It's just... I can't believe it.
[160:22.77]I don't want anyone to ever feel like they're required to pay money to me.
[160:26.65]You know?
[160:27.13]I say it a lot.
[160:28.23]But seriously.
[160:34.03]Oh, that's a big posture break.
[160:39.42]Ohhhh.
[160:42.78]Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.
[160:44.66]Okay.
[160:47.48]Well, I might as well kill you so I can just take a little look around here.
[160:51.06]You know.
[160:55.52]I was just predicting I was going to go up here.
[161:00.28]Can I get him?
[161:02.79]Are you going to forget I'm here?
[161:05.67]Because then I can go over there.
[161:13.19]Okay, this should be it, right?
[161:19.53]No!
[161:25.01]I don't even need it.
[161:31.44]I don't even need it.
[161:34.48]Excellent.
[161:34.98]Alright, that's level... that's three.
[161:36.22]So here we go.
[161:37.98]Item run.
[161:42.13]I want... the thing is, I think I like the firecrackers the best out of all the items.
[161:46.53]Seems the most useful for me.
[161:48.61]So I'm going down firecracker tree.
[161:50.85]I have to make a decision.
[161:59.50]Fuck that guy.
[162:00.02]I already got everything up there.
[162:08.27]Where was that little mini boss standing?
[162:10.95]Right here?
[162:17.07]How do I get up there?
[162:19.37]From here?
[162:26.91]That way?
[162:28.78]You got a hand I can grab onto?
[162:32.44]Maybe I can do it from up there.
[162:33.38]Across the way?
[162:41.67]Maybe?
[162:48.70]Nah, way too long.
[162:50.40]Whoa!
[162:50.70]I didn't think he was going to do that.
[163:00.51]Bad.
[163:00.81]He's gonna do it.
[163:18.08]Okay.
[163:19.36]Goodbye.
[163:22.44]From here, I can go on top of head.
[163:27.45]On top of head.
[163:28.21]To hand.
[163:28.91]To hand.
[163:33.16]Really?
[163:36.40]Huh.
[163:38.56]Well, shit.
[163:44.77]Anything up there I can grab?
[163:52.95]Holy shit.
[163:55.91]90 dollars!
[163:56.37]90 bucks from Comedy Chat Man.
[164:02.01]That's a great name.
[164:05.66]Thank you for the $90.
[164:07.14]Military gang coming in courtesy of my local casino losing for once.
[164:11.36]Love ya.
[164:13.08]Thank you, Comedy Chat Man.
[164:24.65]Gambling money.
[164:26.69]Glad you made it out.
[164:28.97]Glad you made it out of the casino with some cash.
[164:31.87]But thank you for the fucking extreme generosity.
[164:41.59]That means a lot.
[164:42.31]Thank you.
[164:43.47]Well, I don't... Endorse his gambling.
[164:48.29]I've already... We've talked about gambling already.
[164:50.61]If you're just going to enjoy yourself and have some fun at the casino, and you're of age, then yeah, you can have some fun.
[164:57.50]But don't... Just don't go overboard.
[164:59.28]Just have fun.
[164:59.96]Don't do anything crazy.
[165:03.22]Find a small minimum table.
[165:04.72]Play minimum bets.
[165:06.44]Enjoy the atmosphere.
[165:08.96]And know what to do.
[165:09.78]Know when to get out.
[165:12.56]Vegas corrupted him.
[165:14.80]Oh, it didn't.
[165:17.10]I'm fine.
[165:17.46]But I'm grateful to take your casino winnings.
[165:22.31]Thank you so fucking much for the 90 bucks.
[165:35.39]I'll tell you, I'm kind of stuck here.
[165:37.69]I feel like there's something I'm missing.
[165:43.40]Because I can't go from here to there.
[165:45.07]There was a wall behind the mini-boss?
[165:54.43]Yeah, but it looked like it was a little too high for me to get over there.
[165:57.34]Am I crazy?
[166:00.46]I guess not.
[166:01.02]Okay.
[166:02.34]I thought there was a wall to jump up.
[166:05.84]Okay.
[166:06.34]Well... Up.
[166:11.25]This definitely leads to around the corner.
[166:19.59]Holy shit.
[166:21.85]Comedy Chat Man gave another $50.
[166:24.81]What if I said I won this with max bet?
[166:33.38]Look, that's on you to decide.
[166:38.18]I'm not going to tell you not to max bet.
[166:45.35]Nonetheless, that's still, that's another $50.
[166:47.11]Oh Jesus, is that another?
[166:51.47]That's another ape?
[166:54.69]No, no, no, no, that's not another ape.
[166:57.89]Do I have to do this again?
[166:59.61]Does this one have a headless horseman thing?
[167:07.32]No way do you have to do this again.
[167:08.88]I refuse to believe that.
[167:12.16]No way.
[167:12.88]Uh-uh.
[167:14.24]Uh-uh, that's not true.
[167:15.14]You know, I don't have to do this.
[167:15.90]They're not going to play that same card twice.
[167:23.29]Why would they do that?
[167:24.03]That makes no sense.
[167:37.98]I just need to prove to my... This is like a scripted moment.
[167:41.68]I'm gonna jump down here and the snake's gonna eat him or something.
[167:43.90]Or they're gonna get in a fight.
[167:44.66]It's gonna be like the T-Rex versus Velociraptors.
[167:50.44]Where's my idol from here?
[167:52.18]Nice.
[168:03.13]They both look exactly the same.
[168:04.17]I don't know which way is the right way.
[168:08.65]Of course.
[168:09.49]God damn it.
[168:11.65]Why?
[168:24.65]Okay, so this is... Let me just see what's... That's not the way to go.
[168:28.05]Guy with one of the guns?
[168:44.89]Um... Really?
[168:52.72]Both... There's no escape.
[168:56.24]I'm getting telltale aped right now.
[168:58.60]Okay, well... Um... Knowing that that's over here...
[169:09.55]Uh... I'm gonna go heal at the... Where's the nearest one?
[169:21.44]Probably this one's the best one to do, because you can just jump and run straight, right?
[169:25.88]I would assume this is probably the better one to do.
[169:28.80]Because it is just to just jump off.
[169:43.41]Because this is... Holy shit.
[169:47.21]More money.
[169:48.55]Another 50 bucks.
[169:50.49]50 more dollars from ProCefProStar.
[169:54.77]Military money, let's go.
[169:56.66]Except I'm only ROTC.
[170:01.76]Got the military represent coming in here.
[170:05.14]Thanks a lot, guys.
[170:10.42]Thank you, ProCef, for the fucking 50 bucks.
[170:20.81]You guys are too kind.
[170:21.55]Thank you.
[170:32.66]Now I have to fight the monkey.
[170:34.08]That's... What do you think I'm doing?
[170:35.64]I'm just getting full health so I can go in there with at least an attempt.
[170:46.13]Yeah, this is the best route, because you can just... Alright, I'm ready to watch the... But what... Can I, like, sneak on... Hold on.
[170:54.71]Why would you be able to go from this way?
[170:59.07]Does this do anything for you?
[171:00.63]Can I, like, do something sneaky here?
[171:07.47]Or is it...
[171:10.62]No.
[171:11.70]You just kill this guy again.
[171:13.70]Alright, I don't believe that they're gonna do this again, but let's go.
[171:15.92]Let's see what happens.
[171:25.19]Is it the same guy?
[171:26.25]It's the same... It's the same ape!
[171:40.62]Okay.
[171:41.38]Well, hopefully my muscle memory is still here.
[171:55.02]Seems to be pretty good.
[171:55.70]Shit.
[172:06.55]Easy.
[172:06.95]I got this.
[172:14.07]Again.
[172:14.41]So what is phase three of eight?
[172:21.21]He has two bars!
[172:25.46]What the hell could this be?
[172:39.74]Well, yeah, I could have had it.
[172:40.66]I missed it though.
[172:48.68]Oh, don't get too close.
[172:54.92]Oh, shit!
[172:57.65]Bait.
[172:59.17]Oh, what's with the double bait here?
[173:12.25]Get in.
[173:12.63]Too close.
[173:15.95]Back it up.
[173:17.21]What's phase three?
[173:20.00]Does he put the head back on and fucking start singing?
[173:22.30]I don't understand.
[173:23.64]Like, what's he gonna do?
[173:33.12]Dammit.
[173:33.88]I tried.
[173:36.56]Here we go.
[173:39.43]Alright, here we go.
[173:43.77]What is this?
[173:44.25]What's the next phase?
[173:48.01]Okay, we're just gonna stay here.
[173:49.31]We're gonna just keep... He's running away.
[173:52.73]He's gonna put the head back on.
[173:53.59]Head is back on.
[173:56.10]I knew it.
[173:59.06]It's a tag team fight.
[174:01.20]Okay.
[174:02.20]That's just fucking fantastic.
[174:05.90]What the hell do you do, sir?
[174:09.46]I don't have to fight him anymore.
[174:10.93]I just have to avoid him.
[174:14.83]Are you serious?
[174:19.36]He doesn't have a health bar anymore.
[174:25.82]Um, well... Fuck off.
[174:39.47]I don't know where I am.
[174:45.07]Back it up.
[175:00.82]There it is, come on.
[175:02.06]No, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[175:03.42]Easy, easy.
[175:06.49]I got him right where I want him.
[175:24.22]Shit, come on.
[175:33.41]He's so close.
[175:39.79]Look at that health.
[175:45.76]Got you, motherfucker.
[175:46.70]Alright, get out of my way.
[175:50.14]Let's go.
[175:53.88]He ain't gonna do that shit to me.
[175:54.90]I ain't going down here.
[175:58.42]Not gonna happen.
[176:16.43]Come on.
[176:16.99]Get the combo going.
[176:19.77]Really?
[176:21.69]Fuck you, man.
[176:31.11]You call the tag team fight in there.
[176:33.37]Oh, what's that?
[176:35.03]Doesn't even fucking matter.
[176:36.10]Don't get cocky.
[176:38.58]Don't get cocky.
[176:39.06]You didn't win yet.
[176:51.42]Thank you for watching!
[177:30.37]Bring it in.
[177:38.00]Easy now.
[177:38.72]Easy.
[177:39.04]Not gonna fucking fool me here, man.
[177:57.37]Not after all this bullshit.
[178:11.85]Pull it in.
[178:15.15]Oh, you are so close.
[178:16.36]I'm topping myself off.
[178:31.34]See you later.
[178:34.71]Hey, call your mother for me.
[178:47.75]You gonna get up again?
[178:50.59]Unbelievable.
[178:57.45]I can't believe that they did that.
[179:07.90]Memory headless save.
[179:08.68]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe, lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[179:13.14]Commune with a sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase attack power.
[179:17.42]Good.
[179:18.46]Colossal beast plague with the power of undying.
[179:20.86]You're gonna stand up.
[179:21.82]I know it.
[179:24.44]There's two pro- Of course you're gonna stand the fuck up.
[179:28.40]Why wouldn't you?
[179:31.83]Of course you are.
[179:32.47]Is he dead?
[179:41.33]He's gonna come back.
[179:55.25]I got him.
[179:55.57]Okay, he's dead.
[180:10.70]Is he dead?
[180:11.24]Is he dead?
[180:15.58]Is he gonna stand up?
[180:17.71]I hope not.
[180:21.14]Dude, if I come back here and have to do that shit again... Oh, come on.
[180:33.89]Uh, well, let me put my points in.
[180:35.63]There we go.
[180:49.77]Physical attributes.
[180:50.63]Vitality and posture have increased.
[180:52.49]And... And here it is.
[180:58.82]Headless ape.
[181:02.80]At one time, the guardian ape shared its den with a mate, but he alone became infested while the other passed away.
[181:08.10]Even the flowers offered in tribute to her passing have withered to dust.
[181:12.83]So this thing is going to be like Mr. Rex.
[181:17.45]Well, at least I got points for it.
[181:21.33]Uh, we had huge bits come in from Comedy Chapman during that fight.
[181:26.96]Thank you so much for the $100, Comedy Chapman.
[181:29.42]And my bank just texted me asking if this was fraudulent.
[181:34.64]Uh, you probably, you probably should, should not, should not charge that many times.
[181:42.03]But be careful.
[181:43.81]I appreciate the fucking hundreds of dollars.
[181:46.13]Holy shit.
[181:46.95]Thank you.
[181:51.28]My god, alright.
[181:56.59]Well, I have a feeling you'll be back.
[182:03.53]Why don't you just cut this thing in half?
[182:13.04]Whatever.
[182:18.57]It's undying.
[182:21.43]I got it.
[182:23.98]I got the ape.
[182:30.28]Let me see, was there a way I could go from here?
[182:32.74]Can I go up that cliff?
[182:37.66]No, I can't reach that.
[182:45.56]Yeah, I can't, wait, I can?
[182:51.01]From here?
[182:51.85]Oh, shi- Okay, well I didn't see the indicator.
[182:53.57]Alright.
[182:58.41]Now what the hell am I supposed to do?
[183:16.72]Oh, hi.
[183:22.83]Still walking around, huh?
[183:24.57]She's gone.
[183:25.37]But she was here just moments ago.
[183:31.23]You?
[183:32.31]Hmm?
[183:34.23]Oh, Shinobi.
[183:35.87]Listen.
[183:37.47]I finally saw her.
[183:39.59]The shamisen player.
[183:41.67]Was a woman.
[183:43.15]I only saw her from afar.
[183:45.43]But I could tell.
[183:46.27]A beautiful, yet fleeting presence.
[183:51.80]Oh...
[183:52.55]This guy's kind of going crazy, huh?
[183:54.13]Misty Forest.
[184:22.79]I don't know shit, apparently.
[184:23.97]Apparently, I just don't know shit.
[184:25.47]Okay.
[184:25.75]Nice knowing you.
[184:26.25]Well, here's the fog.
[185:04.26]Oh, I got five.
[185:06.14]Alright.
[185:07.42]What do you say?
[185:08.24]I feel like I need to get some more of these.
[185:23.33]Run and slide.
[185:27.59]Or I don't feel like I don't use this that often, though.
[185:33.10]It does it twice.
[185:38.10]This is the Nightjar Slash.
[185:44.16]I mean, I am so far down this tree that I might as well just do it.
[185:48.17]Let's do it.
[185:49.53]So this is the double.
[185:51.25]And this is the cross.
[185:56.19]Recovers posture upon executing a successful death blow.
[185:58.65]That's really good.
[186:04.50]That'll be helpful in some boss fights.
[186:11.95]Maybe not.
[186:23.37]Probably this then.
[186:25.55]Or I'll hold on to it.
[186:30.47]Alright, what about my skills here?
[186:32.03]Is it already equipped?
[186:34.39]Double!
[186:36.32]Let's see here.
[186:44.87]Adds a follow-up attack.
[186:49.09]So wait, hold on, so... Oh, wow.
[186:56.73]So I can just do it twice.
[187:01.95]Break posture that way.
[187:02.95]Alright.
[187:04.04]Cool.
[187:06.60]What's this?
[187:06.98]Uh, is this breadcrumbs for me to find my way around?
[187:16.45]Probably.
[187:18.59]Who knows?
[187:18.93]Oh, well, it's the return of the chickens.
[187:25.60]Any more chickens?
[187:37.74]No, just one hiding over here.
[187:46.82]Oh, by the way, I first tried that double ape thing.
[187:50.79]Just in case somebody wouldn't pay attention.
[187:52.19]I told you I was gonna do it once.
[188:02.75]What does that mean?
[188:03.45]Are you just gonna do this?
[188:06.26]Nobody's talking.
[188:20.43]Oh, come on.
[188:21.87]What?
[188:30.55]I'm still alive.
[188:36.75]How much does the mist protect me?
[188:41.00]This guy's a ghost.
[188:44.66]Wait a minute.
[188:45.22]Can I kill this?
[188:45.72]Yeah, I can kill him.
[188:57.55]That's it, right?
[188:58.31]You dead?
[189:04.46]You know what?
[189:07.84]I'm going to use one of these.
[189:10.38]Like, what is this?
[189:13.50]Sure.
[189:13.90]Like, just do it.
[189:24.86]Oh!
[189:28.39]Ah, not yet.
[189:28.95]Whoa, not yet.
[189:29.55]Hold on.
[189:30.07]Who?
[189:32.91]This game is relentless.
[189:36.13]I just did double ape and there's already a guy standing there.
[189:39.70]That guy also doesn't have a head.
[189:41.82]Is that a small ape?
[189:46.20]What's with small ape without head?
[189:54.21]Just wait.
[190:00.86]There's other shit up here.
[190:03.10]I'm not gonna run into a wall for the next 40 minutes right now.
[190:05.78]Hold on, let me just get some stuff and just take a look around.
[190:09.17]There's an item right here.
[190:17.95]What's with the apes?
[190:21.47]It's all apes.
[190:23.01]It's all apes.
[190:24.59]Hey.
[190:25.57]Hey, you.
[190:29.20]If you know the path of Buddha, would you slay one who opposes it?
[190:35.13]One who opposes the Buddha?
[190:37.31]Correct.
[190:42.35]The one of whom I speak hides in an abandoned temple up ahead.
[190:47.09]He sealed away the village in a shadowy fog so that he can fool the villagers.
[190:53.30]An abandoned temple?
[190:55.10]Yes.
[190:56.30]It's an old building.
[191:00.45]A hole in the second floor.
[191:02.45]Thanks for the help, old man.
[191:06.23]Anything else you have for me?
[191:12.48]A hole in the second floor.
[191:13.88]Go up to the hole in the second floor.
[191:16.06]I will try.
[191:16.58]No guarantees, though.
[191:21.24]Let's get this item while we're here.
[191:23.18]Pellets.
[191:23.62]I'm thankfully getting a lot of those.
[191:25.80]What is it?
[191:26.31]Turkey?
[191:31.68]I need to get over here.
[191:40.22]Okay.
[191:41.34]Hmm.
[191:47.37]Coin purse.
[191:47.81]Haven't found one of those in a while.
[191:55.21]That leaves me... How much money do I have?
[191:58.43]I gotta go buy some coin sacks.
[192:03.09]You know what I'm saying?
[192:05.87]I'm getting in to the thick of it here.
[192:20.66]Well, I thought I was only gonna have to hit you once.
[192:30.74]Okay.
[192:33.06]There is the guy with no head down that way somewhere.
[192:36.60]He's in the beginning.
[192:45.53]Okay.
[192:51.53]Well, there's the second floor.
[193:07.65]Who's next?
[193:15.67]One more?
[193:21.29]Ow.
[193:21.65]Ooh.
[193:22.82]It's a ghost dog.
[193:34.10]Where is he?
[193:35.25]Oh, I can't, it's hard to see them through the fog.
[193:48.81]Okay.
[193:50.44]Not, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[193:54.50]I need to explore.
[194:03.23]Oil?
[194:04.69]Let's just look down here.
[194:05.83]I see some items.
[194:20.51]There's three sacks down there.
[194:23.17]That's gotta be a trap, right?
[194:25.00]Who?
[194:26.74]Who is it?
[194:30.64]What the fuck?
[194:37.33]I think I've heard that.
[194:38.73]Holy shit.
[194:39.55]I knew it was kind of... Just get them.
[194:40.69]Get them.
[194:41.11]Get them.
[194:45.19]Oh, fuck.
[194:46.09]Holy shit.
[194:47.33]Oh, boy.
[194:47.97]This is bad.
[194:48.69]Very bad.
[194:49.31]I'm dead.
[194:51.03]There's like 50 people down here.
[194:56.50]Get me out.
[194:56.86]Get me out.
[194:57.20]Get me out.
[194:57.62]Out, out, out.
[195:05.89]Where the fuck did I just fall?
[195:08.21]What the hell?
[195:16.45]See ya.
[195:17.77]Uh-uh.
[195:20.49]Anybody see me?
[195:26.16]Because I kinda... You motherfucker.
[195:30.48]Of course.
[195:31.56]Right.
[195:32.16]Sure.
[195:32.28]Sure.
[195:36.24]Seriously.
[195:37.40]Seriously?
[195:40.68]Where?
[195:48.97]What?
[195:50.61]What the fuck?
[195:51.95]Why?
[195:54.99]He's all the way across there.
[195:59.62]Unbelievable.
[196:00.68]I can't do this.
[196:02.40]That guy has to die.
[196:29.24]Where's this asshole?
[196:31.18]There he is.
[196:35.00]My fucking god, there's so many!
[196:38.58]Oh my god!
[196:41.15]They just are in random- Okay, not gonna happen.
[196:44.47]Sorry.
[196:45.69]No.
[197:01.01]Oh my god.
[197:09.81]Will you fuck off?
[197:12.81]Go to hell.
[197:34.22]There he is.
[197:44.29]Ugh, yuck.
[197:55.50]Finally.
[197:55.80]Can I get a second here now?
[197:58.50]Can I get the actual items, please?
[198:01.28]Scrap.
[198:02.08]Somebody else is up here.
[198:04.44]There you are.
[198:09.86]Laser lightning vision!
[198:13.18]Doesn't matter where you are, I'll have tracking and line of sight on you forever!
[198:17.53]Did you jump?
[198:18.17]Fuck it.
[198:18.87]I still got you.
[198:21.35]Are you between?
[198:22.01]Are you across the map?
[198:23.81]Through mist?
[198:25.95]2,000 feet away?
[198:26.95]I still got you in the head.
[198:39.28]Okay, I think that freed it up.
[198:41.30]Now I should be able to get that item over there.
[198:44.78]I think.
[198:46.46]We'll see.
[198:51.77]Because that guy was standing right here, and now I can shimmy across.
[199:00.39]Right.
[199:02.41]It better be.
[199:12.03]If you're good at something, never do it.
[199:13.25]This guy likes to complain, huh?
[199:15.54]It was across the map.
[199:16.60]The mist.
[199:18.14]I can complain about that.
[199:22.66]What?
[199:24.30]Huh?
[199:26.78]What was the mini-boss thing there?
[199:27.94]I just got an indicator.
[199:28.82]That was weird.
[199:40.52]Why did I just get a mini-boss thing?
[200:03.02]Here.
[200:03.26]I'm back here.
[200:09.92]The headless guy, right.
[200:11.08]Oh, okay.
[200:13.70]Well, let's try to go inside the tower.
[200:22.30]Everybody's dead, so... Except for you!
[200:28.89]You're still alive.
[200:41.40]Take a look around.
[200:42.02]Don't... Just wait.
[200:43.16]Look around back.
[200:43.76]Uh-huh.
[200:45.86]Let's see.
[200:47.86]Let's see.
[200:52.44]This is why.
[200:52.90]Where'd he go?
[201:05.03]I'm gonna kick... Wow.
[201:07.05]Dishonorable.
[201:08.43]Dishonored.
[201:11.85]Oh, this guy's gonna fucking kill me.
[201:13.45]The dirt-throwing asshole.
[201:27.18]Oh no, he had air pods in.
[201:29.06]He can't see or smell or... whatever.
[201:32.08]Can I knock this off?
[201:49.24]Nah, I'm only doing one at a time.
[201:50.24]Look, they're invisible.
[201:53.04]Motherfucker.
[201:53.58]And how did I not block you?
[201:56.03]Oh, the complaints are starting to pile up.
[201:57.95]He's starting to get to like a four.
[201:59.69]He's going to a five.
[202:17.13]What were you looking at?
[202:18.95]Just a ceramic shard.
[202:21.27]The worst I... Don't let him get to you.
[202:39.92]I think I've collected everything.
[202:46.60]Is that the music that the guy was talking about?
[202:48.15]The melody?
[202:50.33]I can hear it now.
[202:50.89]Does that mean I'm going crazy?
[202:59.90]Anything up here?
[203:03.96]Don't think so.
[203:05.28]Maybe, yeah, there's some stuff over there.
[203:19.15]Are we supposed to hear music?
[203:21.25]Yeah.
[203:22.65]It's supposed to be playing a little tune right now.
[203:27.63]Um, what's the correct path to get up there?
[203:39.92]We can go this way.
[203:40.62]Um... Hmm.
[203:59.43]Nothing above me either.
[204:00.27]I don't think I can grab anything over there.
[204:10.35]From here?
[204:14.64]Can I grab that?
[204:25.40]Huh.
[204:26.20]Well.
[204:34.51]This is the only one I can grab right here.
[204:36.68]There's apparently a dog.
[204:43.00]I'm not- I can't grab these ones.
[204:46.66]Where's this dog?
[204:51.50]Right there.
[204:53.33]Where are you?
[204:54.21]Where the fuck are you?
[205:06.23]No, the door's locked.
[205:07.19]I can't go in the front door.
[205:08.19]I have to go up top.
[205:22.86]Somebody said go inside.
[205:25.51]It's not that easy.
[205:28.25]You would think that I would be able to jump from the one over there to somewhere.
[205:38.33]Whoa!
[205:40.31]You just scared the shit out of me.
[205:41.79]Okay.
[205:42.07]Let me go around this way.
[205:48.29]I think these guys just respawned.
[206:01.60]Here?
[206:06.94]What the fuck?
[206:07.98]I'm just lost here.
[206:09.00]And they just keep respawning.
[206:15.33]In this misty bullshit zone.
[206:22.15]I went all the way back here.
[206:36.28]Well, there's a guy here now.
[206:40.15]Who the fuck is this?
[206:42.59]Oh, it's all about the monkeys!
[206:45.15]Welcome to Sekiro!
[206:48.01]Do you like apes?
[206:55.84]Oh my god, it's a drunk guy.
[207:03.02]Fuck me, really.
[207:04.90]Um... I gotta remember how to fight this guy.
[207:07.88]Maybe not.
[207:08.78]What if I just get the hell out of here?
[207:19.17]Ugh.
[207:19.31]I don't have any healing.
[207:22.41]I don't know if I'll be able to beat this guy with just one mental health.
[207:46.90]Back it up.
[208:01.08]I'm surprised I have to fight this guy again.
[208:03.06]It's a grab, right?
[208:15.82]That was weird.
[208:23.20]Oh, I'm fucked.
[208:24.28]Bad idea.
[208:26.42]Bad idea.
[208:27.40]Get me the fuck out of here before he kills me.
[208:28.68]You're gonna kill me right now!
[208:29.42]I can't jump off the wall!
[208:30.84]Oh game, I hate you.
[208:37.69]You put like two defensive linemen in every place that I want to go.
[208:46.03]There's a guy downstairs.
[208:46.87]There's a guy upstairs.
[208:48.09]What the hell is in here?
[208:51.56]Nothing?
[208:55.36]Oh, fuck.
[208:55.80]He's chasing me.
[208:57.40]Oh, fuck that.
[209:03.30]He can't get over here, right?
[209:06.77]Oh, thank God.
[209:10.79]It's just barely out of reach.
[209:14.39]Everybody calling me a coward right now.
[209:15.95]Uh, yeah.
[209:18.01]I'm sorry.
[209:18.59]I'm not gonna fight this guy with no health potions.
[209:21.12]A dude I haven't seen in, like, 22 hours of gameplay.
[209:27.44]I'm not gonna fight him right now.
[209:28.58]I need health.
[209:35.13]Uh... Where the fuck am I going?
[209:44.18]I think that this is probably the... Is this the right way?
[209:46.35]I'm gonna take a pellet, because one... Yeah.
[209:53.09]I will accidentally get touched by somebody and die.
[210:01.06]Lump of fat wax.
[210:04.48]Can be used for intermediate and higher occultic upgrades for prosthetic tools.
[210:12.49]Nice.
[210:13.09]Ooh, alright.
[210:14.13]So you have to go that way.
[210:19.52]Now how the fuck would you have figured that out?
[210:22.18]I mean, I did, but... How the hell would you have figured that out?
[210:30.56]Without the guide.
[210:38.11]Do I get another stone?
[210:46.45]Where's my stone?
[210:52.13]Okay, this is like a Zoidberg.
[210:58.07]I don't get a... I don't get a thing for Zoidberg.
[211:07.90]Uh, well, time to die.
[211:18.32]Might as well give it at least an attempt.
[211:30.83]I still got it!
[211:38.91]This guy sucks!
[211:50.02]Love of Grave Wax.
[211:53.34]Wow.
[211:55.14]That guy... I just destroyed that guy.
[212:07.10]That was just a giant shrimp.
[212:18.62]Now what?
[212:19.98]I didn't get a bead for that?
[212:25.62]Well, the mist is gone.
[212:27.14]That's a plus.
[212:38.73]Okay.
[212:48.43]Are the enemies just alive now?
[212:49.99]Are they going to be regular dogs?
[212:55.42]I have no idea.
[213:01.74]Where the fuck did I go?
[213:05.05]So they would illusion people.
[213:14.79]Where's that dude?
[213:18.89]Feels weird.
[213:19.45]Oh, wait.
[213:19.89]I can see there's a thing right there.
[213:22.83]But if I go down there... Where's the guy?
[213:30.31]I need to complete my quest.
[213:32.95]Thankfully there's an idol right down here.
[213:41.30]What's that?
[213:41.68]I don't know.
[213:45.38]Well, I'm gonna get the idol.
[213:48.54]Why the hell wouldn't I?
[214:03.48]Okay, I have a checkpoint here.
[214:05.73]Is this... This dude's back.
[214:09.51]Buy an offering.
[214:10.19]Okay, what do you got?
[214:11.21]Sugar.
[214:11.33]You got scrap.
[214:13.17]Dragon Spring Sake.
[214:15.47]You got these... No, I haven't seen a gourd in a long time.
[214:19.34]What do I have for money?
[214:20.50]Okay.
[214:33.69]317.
[214:35.17]Maybe I'll just buy a shipload of these.
[214:36.47]1800 for this.
[214:46.36]Reduces terror and increases terror resistance.
[214:50.43]Where you from?
[215:01.84]Alright, well, I don't know.
[215:03.06]Apparently I didn't have that on.
[215:05.85]What do I have to sell?
[215:06.53]A whole lot of nothing.
[215:12.23]I have 31 of these.
[215:19.51]What the fuck does this do?
[215:24.56]Restores a node of Resurrective Power
[215:32.13]I gotta pee.
[215:33.69]Is this a bad guy?
[215:46.27]Yeah, I guess.
[215:46.93]I almost have four points.
[216:03.31]Meeboo Village.
[216:05.71]Whoa, they're back.
[216:06.71]Do these people ever die?
[216:11.07]Are they just coming out of the ground?
[216:12.49]I can't tell.
[216:20.12]That was the scream that I make.
[216:23.38]Did you almost just get grabbed by the monkey boss?
[216:26.18]Okay, what in the name of God is going on here?
[216:33.31]Alright, I gotta pee.
[216:36.49]There's an item.
[216:39.29]And I need to... I don't know what I... I'm getting off my head here.
[216:46.51]There's a couple of mini-bosses back there.
[216:49.69]Who the hell are you?
[216:52.36]Who the fuck is this?
[216:53.56]What?
[217:05.24]You're not... Nice move.
[217:16.99]Nice move.
[217:25.43]No, I gotta stop doing that shit, man.
[217:27.00]This guy's hard.
[217:31.90]Scrap.
[217:32.24]What was he guarding?
[217:33.30]He was guarding something.
[217:41.81]Treasure carp.
[217:46.79]What's that noise?
[217:47.27]Can I sneak under here?
[217:55.81]No, I guess not.
[218:03.01]Okay.
[218:04.63]I need to pee.
[218:09.24]I'm going to pee.
[218:09.64]I'm going to drink a little bit of water.
[218:10.99]And I'm going to grab another cider.
[218:15.37]I'll be right back.
[221:25.14]Alright.
[221:29.56]We good?
[221:31.91]We good.
[221:32.95]Move this back over here.
[221:41.15]OK.
[221:59.13]What about that guy?
[222:06.62]Anything down here?
[222:09.68]Kind of.
[222:10.02]There's a little entryway to go.
[222:16.55]How many dogs?
[222:18.11]Gotta go.
[222:18.35]I just gotta go and swing him.
[222:19.39]There's a bunch of dogs.
[222:19.99]Just swing at everybody.
[222:24.33]Sometimes you gotta spam dogs.
[222:26.61]What's the music still playing for?
[222:36.56]This item.
[222:41.64]Coins.
[222:42.80]I think that's the only thing that's over here.
[222:45.92]Well, that's wonderful.
[222:47.08]All that for just a coin purse.
[222:59.78]No, what?
[223:03.00]Oh, what?
[223:06.14]Dick!
[223:07.84]You dick!
[223:27.96]This is a really bad place to fight this dude.
[223:30.17]Fuck!
[223:31.11]No!
[223:31.29]God damn it!
[224:00.44]This guy is kicking my ass.
[224:24.49]Break him.
[224:25.21]Get out of here.
[224:32.82]Okay, that's... That was... Wait, was that the guy that I just... What?
[224:50.30]Give me that item.
[224:51.14]You have an item?
[224:57.04]This is the item right here that I was looking for.
[224:59.26]Fat Wax.
[225:12.78]Any more items?
[225:14.01]No.
[225:17.74]This is shit.
[225:18.22]I got to be careful.
[225:18.92]I got to stealth.
[225:19.54]There's a bunch of people here.
[225:46.35]Fuck.
[225:51.32]Oh!
[225:52.62]I'm okay.
[225:53.36]I'm okay.
[225:57.30]Basket, basket, basket, basket, basket.
[226:01.22]I am a basket.
[226:04.75]Hey.
[226:05.35]Basket, basket, basket, basket.
[226:10.35]Calm down.
[226:11.91]You.
[226:13.83]Are you an honorable person?
[226:17.33]Yes.
[226:19.63]Thank goodness.
[226:20.39]You are an honorable person.
[226:25.36]Is there something you want to ask?
[226:29.18]Look, sorry, but if you have questions, I'll have to answer with this basket on my head.
[226:37.00]Um, OK.
[226:38.86]Ask about the village.
[226:40.62]What's wrong with the village?
[226:41.44]After I puked?
[226:57.03]I was thirsty, so I drank a lot of sake.
[227:00.80]I'm sure that's what made me throw up.
[227:02.80]The head priest sometimes treats us to sake.
[227:05.40]But you know, when you drink sake, you get thirsty.
[227:09.78]The sake cask runs dry in no time, so everyone has no choice but to drink the water in the ponds and rivers.
[227:16.86]But the more you drink it, the thirstier you get.
[227:22.91]What the fuck is going on here?
[227:24.17]I get thirstier and thirstier.
[227:26.29]Can't ever drink enough.
[227:30.70]What about the villagers?
[227:31.38]What is wrong with the villagers?
[227:33.86]No idea.
[227:34.66]All I know is they all fear fire.
[227:37.28]Fire.
[227:37.70]For a while, I too was in the same place.
[227:40.72]And I felt the fire.
[227:41.88]Fire.
[227:45.48]Even now, the thought of it gives me chills.
[227:48.04]An unquenchable fire.
[227:49.86]The hunter, Inuhiko, started burning pine resin and locked himself in his house.
[227:54.60]His pine resin burns a long time.
[227:56.73]Fire?
[227:57.55]It's a real nuisance.
[227:59.15]Inuhiko is the village outcast.
[228:01.53]He likes eating wild animal meat and the sort.
[228:03.89]That's why the head priest doesn't give him any sake.
[228:06.33]Where is Inuhiko's house?
[228:08.21]Oh!
[228:09.31]The fuck was that?
[228:14.50]Okay, what is that noise?
[228:15.90]Somebody just broke a bunch of shit.
[228:20.86]I'm safe in here right?
[228:21.48]I hope so.
[228:21.82]I hear something getting louder.
[228:44.53]Okay.
[228:45.63]You've been... You've been a big help.
[228:49.47]Thank you.
[228:49.84]Um...
[229:15.76]I'm gonna go in the boat.
[229:31.50]Wealth balloon.
[229:32.33]Okay, he said the house over here.
[229:36.89]Hold on, I'm gonna get this stuff in the boat.
[229:43.43]Pellet.
[229:44.31]Alright, safe.
[229:51.00]More houses.
[229:53.96]Can I go into any of these?
[229:55.04]I wonder if there's a place to drop in.
[230:02.52]Um.
[230:07.64]Eee.
[230:22.75]Items, give me.
[230:25.72]Fistful of Ash.
[230:30.36]Scrap.
[230:32.94]Pine Resin Ember.
[230:36.12]A piece of resin that contains a continuously smoldering flame can be used to upgrade the Flame Vent.
[230:42.82]The resin was found in a black pine within the forest of Mibu Village.
[230:46.92]The ever-smoldering flames act as a landmark to find ways to the village.
[230:50.45]In time, the villagers came to load the flames, and the black pines were lost.
[230:53.73]Those who defended the flame were equally loaded.
[231:08.60]Got a blast!
[231:14.50]Uh...
[231:24.46]I'm so confused and scared at the same time.
[231:26.54]I don't like this place.
[231:33.08]I'm just going to go to the hut over here.
[231:42.13]Down there.
[231:47.66]I can go across this.
[231:49.56]Ooh.
[231:50.10]Can I go down here?
[231:54.36]I wonder if I can make it from this way.
[231:55.44]Probably can.
[231:59.88]Where?

[232:04.61]You can swim?
[232:05.19]Yeah, but I wanna check the outskirts.

[233:06.15]What is this, Resident Evil 1?
[233:14.51]Yes!
[233:14.95]Gourd Seed.
[233:16.19]Oh, I'm just picking up items.
[233:18.23]Oh!

[233:26.82]Too many.
[233:27.82]Too many duns.
[233:28.82]Too many duns.
[233:31.68]We got a guy with the bell.
[233:34.50]Make it.
[233:34.78]Make it.
[233:35.08]Make it.

[233:37.38]You.
[233:40.83]Yes.
[233:41.09]Okay.
[233:41.31]I'm almost there.
[233:48.33]Um.
[233:54.37]Find confetti.
[233:55.30]I have
[234:00.29]Oh, fuck.
[234:06.37]And then, I'm gonna climb up here.
[234:07.93]There's a wheel.
[234:10.55]Gimme this thing.
[234:14.59]Ugh, alright.
[234:18.84]Rest here.
[234:23.90]So I have a statue on this side and a statue on the other side.
[234:29.83]Didn't say there was a guy in this house?
[234:32.71]Oh, fuck.
[234:41.03]Whatever that item is, I want it.
[234:42.13]I need it.
[234:42.45]Okay.
[234:57.51]Um, fuck, there's a way to go over here, too.
[235:01.21]Oh, god.
[235:01.75]Did I not get him?
[235:13.94]Oh, I could do it twice.
[235:15.42]Alright, we got another big guy.
[235:24.51]I think I can wrap around here.
[235:47.96]Is this a starter zone?
[236:01.29]That looks like the thing in the beginning.
[236:05.29]Contact medicine, good.
[236:07.82]I gotta get this guy first.
[236:09.02]What are they doing, like Stardew Valley out here?
[236:26.63]Okay, is there any- what's over here?
[236:31.69]This is hard to explore because it's kind of all over the place, but...
[236:36.76]I kind of want to see what the hell this is.
[236:38.24]What is this?
[236:40.84]No, I already got the seed.
[236:45.43]Item right here.
[236:47.19]Pellets.
[236:53.07]So I got both sides there.
[236:55.03]I got one incoming plane.
[237:08.26]Something in there.
[237:11.25]Something in here.
[237:19.62]There's a lot of items.
[237:24.78]Fuck, I want to get up there.
[237:39.14]There's too many items in this zone.
[237:42.08]I have to get them.
[237:47.08]I could go down there too.
[238:03.51]Oh, okay.
[238:04.21]What's this?
[238:05.47]Yes!
[238:07.58]I'm starting to feel so fulfilled that I almost have every item in this whole zone.
[238:13.25]Alright, let's go.
[238:13.91]I'm gonna level up my gourd thing.
[238:23.08]Fuck.
[238:23.34]Oh well.
[238:38.23]Let's take a look.
[238:43.37]Five.
[238:45.53]Midair deflection.
[238:47.27]I can get this.
[238:48.13]I can get the Ashina cross.
[238:49.12]I can get the final thing in this tree.
[238:52.70]From a sheath stance, draw the blade at high speed.
[239:03.49]Sheathed.
[239:11.27]How do I go into Sheath?
[239:12.77]I want LRT to enter Sheath's stance.
[239:29.22]Release left trigger, cancel Sheath's stance, leave Sheath's battle stance.
[239:33.27]Release right trigger, Sheath across.
[239:35.13]Fuck it, let's get it.
[239:43.02]Alright, so.
[239:45.22]Sheathed.
[239:47.86]That gets you out if you let go of left trigger, but if you let go of right trigger... Okay.
[239:54.72]There he is!
[240:05.68]Did you make it?
[240:07.82]Hey, sorry I slaughtered the person that you thought was cool.
[240:12.79]Is that you, Shinobi?
[240:15.22]I was so taken by the melody.
[240:18.44]I did not see you coming.
[240:20.92]Ah, I can hear it.
[240:23.62]I'm sure the shamisen player is just beyond here.
[240:28.36]I knew it.
[240:30.60]He's been waiting for me the whole time.
[240:34.10]OK.
[240:36.60]That's it?
[240:39.34]Anything else?
[240:49.94]I feel like this is not going to be useful here.
[240:58.43]I don't know.
[241:09.62]Hey there.
[241:11.26]Welcome to my little comfy mode.
[241:28.35]I forgot.
[241:28.99]Hold on.
[241:44.81]Wow.
[241:44.99]Alright.
[241:49.11]Gourd Seed.
[241:50.07]I would like to level it up, please.
[241:57.25]Well, first of all, here.
[242:01.15]Didn't I get something?
[242:03.47]No, I didn't.
[242:05.43]Where is it?
[242:05.85]Hey, okay.
[242:09.71]Didn't I get something special?
[242:10.85]Alright, it's time to start spending points.
[242:14.43]I can't just be a piece of crap.
[242:16.95]Right?
[242:17.81]Like, I have to use these.
[242:20.24]Hold on to them.
[242:20.84]What if I need them?
[242:22.36]I gotta pick a tree and just go.
[242:26.25]I did get the flame thing, right?
[242:33.72]I'm going for it.
[242:35.66]Let's go.
[242:37.60]Flame vent.
[242:44.04]Then we can go through to loaded umbrella magnet.
[242:52.42]When spread open, it will protect against attacks from all directions.
[242:54.96]Hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks.
[242:58.51]Has a tempered magnetic shaft that makes it nearly unbreakable.
[243:02.57]Enemy attack can be deflected by spinning the open umbrella.
[243:05.15]Alright, well here's the fucking super one.
[243:14.03]If it's a short-range flame blast, continuous fire damage will inflict the burn status.
[243:17.68]It is able to maintain a continuous stream of flames due to the smoldering resonance side of the tube mechanism.
[243:24.38]So I just need money.
[243:26.12]And then a few more.
[243:27.73]Well, let's see.
[243:28.29]Yeah, I need money and then a few more of those.
[243:39.33]So I got a better flame vent.
[243:43.31]I just need money.
[243:45.04]That seems stupid.
[243:47.60]How much money do I have?
[243:48.54]Another thousand.
[243:55.31]I got money.
[243:56.71]I've got some money.
[243:57.51]How much is it?
[243:59.19]500?
[244:04.37]Okay, it's 600.
[244:12.22]So that brings... this is the better umbrella.
[244:17.60]Then we got the flame vent, which goes to golden vortex.
[244:22.73]Jesus.
[244:24.76]What do you mean NAMF?
[244:26.14]It's 600.
[244:26.32]What are you talking about?
[244:37.06]So I need three more black gunpowder.
[244:40.90]And then look at this shit.
[244:41.76]Golden vortex.
[244:44.53]A large and withered golden fan.
[244:46.63]Gather illustrious golden wind and release it to force enemies caught in the vortex to face the other way.
[244:52.37]Can be performed twice in a row.
[244:55.64]Enemies that have been turned around drop items or money, considered to be donations.
[245:02.96]And this is the new umbrella.
[245:04.17]When spread open, it will protect against attacks from all directions.
[245:07.63]The blessing of the vermilion bird prevents damage from fire and also prevents burn.
[245:13.83]Sounds kind of good.
[245:17.06]Alright, so I need some more black gunpowder.
[245:22.38]I got some, you want some monkey booze?
[245:23.62]I got it, here.
[245:25.71]I brought something for you.
[245:27.33]Monkey booze, is it?
[245:33.94]It burns the throat, same as ever.
[245:36.20]This really brings back memories.
[245:38.64]Did you drink this often?
[245:40.42]I trained in the techniques of the shinobi, in the valley where the monkeys dwelled.
[245:45.82]By yourself?
[245:46.96]No, there were two of us.
[245:48.78]We were rogue shinobi.
[245:50.44]There was no proper master for the likes of us.
[245:53.19]That's why we went to the valley.
[245:55.63]to run to jump to clash swords where one slip would mean your doom that was how we trained we came to move exactly as monkeys did after a time I'd drink this monkey booze whenever I tired monkey booze dude I can't wait for the youtube channels that come out with the DIY monkey booze from sakiro
[246:25.06]One part simple syrup, two parts grenadine, a splash of Sprite, and triple sec.
[246:34.66]I'll take seven million views, please.
[246:37.05]Thank you guys.
[246:37.79]I think that's all I can do.
[246:46.73]I'll lend you shelter.
[246:48.93]Shit in it.
[246:49.71]Like a monkey does.
[246:51.07]Monkeys don't shit in their food.
[246:52.33]They shit in their hands and throw it at people.
[246:53.87]Alright.
[246:55.66]Umbrella.
[246:56.92]Spring-loaded firecracker.
[246:59.34]And... Okay, well, what the heck?
[247:01.72]And spring-load flame vent.
[247:07.61]I've got all... What the fuck am I doing?
[247:09.73]Spring-load... Spring-load... There we go.
[247:13.69]Thank you!
[247:19.44]Now I need to give the seed to the lady.
[247:26.72]I can charge it, right?
[247:28.94]Ooh, that's actually really cool.
[247:30.84]It shouldn't cost money here.
[247:33.11]Let's be real.
[247:33.65]Where's the lady?
[247:40.69]Oh wait, didn't she...

[248:16.22]The Mortal Blade.
[248:17.02]Immortal Severance scrap.
[248:42.61]Part of the Book of Immortal Severance left behind by Takeru.
[248:45.25]With Mortal Blade in hand, my blood may be shed.
[248:48.09]With my blood, the Aroma will be complete.
[248:50.25]The Divine Realm will be in reach.
[248:51.62]Immortal Severance will be at hand.
[248:52.90]I must ask Tomoe to assist with the beheading.
[248:55.22]This was written by Lord Takeru?
[248:57.40]It was.
[248:58.36]With the Mortal Blade, you may wound the Divine Heir, and his blood will be allowed to flow.
[249:04.71]I see.
[249:05.63]This brings us one step closer to Immortal Severance.
[249:08.57]I shall tell my lord.
[249:12.05]But I got a seed.
[249:12.97]Can I have some extra gourd, please?
[249:14.31]Because I told the mortal blade.
[249:15.83]Yes, I shall tell.
[249:16.85]Of course.
[249:24.46]Here.
[249:25.38]Oh, this is... This is monkey booze.
[249:31.38]What, you don't like it?
[249:32.67]Well, let me try it.
[249:34.67]I kind of want monkey booze.
[249:40.41]Oh.
[249:42.46]Monkey booze is the moonshine of Sekiro, right?
[249:45.44]This is some Jungle Book shit here.
[250:07.45]Raised by wolves.
[250:08.23]Didn't they add that character?
[250:10.09]Didn't that character not exist?
[250:39.12]Then he gave me the rice ball.
[250:41.14]It tasted so good.
[250:43.02]What a kind monkey.
[250:44.10]Yeah, King Louie does not exist in that story.
[250:47.91]Disney added that character.
[250:50.51]It's already ruined your childhood.
[250:55.01]Goodbye.
[251:04.02]I mean as long as you don't get too prideful in Fullmetal Alchemist.
[251:06.98]Same actress.
[251:34.29]I went I went I went I went I went the aroma of the fountainhead keep up the good work wolf so the ever blossom has withered and no longer remains
[251:47.07]That is correct.
[251:48.07]You can't, like, fuck a... It is said that someone plucked a branch from the Everblossom and stole off with it.
[251:55.37]What's the law of finding a stolen tree branch?
[251:57.77]Let us gather what we... As you wish.
[252:00.07]Listen, if you... Oh, that's right.
[252:02.14]That door marked with the outline of a person.
[252:06.34]A Shinobi shortcut.
[252:08.50]I haven't a clue how it works.
[252:10.54]But seeing as he mentioned Shinobi... Shinobi shortcut.
[252:19.80]okay um just because you reference an animated show like well you're not allowed to you're not allowed to ever watch a single anime ever never you're never I'm not you're never allowed to watch a single animated television show that's not spongebob or Family Guy
[252:49.63]I've watched one anime per year.
[252:52.19]And they're alright.
[252:52.77]They're fine.
[252:56.85]Okay, so let me go back to where I was.
[253:01.25]Where the hell was that depth, right?
[253:05.84]Yeah.
[253:09.90]What am I watching for 2019?
[253:10.54]I don't know.
[253:17.17]I don't know.
[253:20.01]Alright, let's see what the hell happens over here.
[253:21.91]There's the banjo lady.
[253:28.76]Let's see.
[253:30.10]Open field.
[253:30.72]Okay, it's not a boss.
[253:41.34]Okay.
[253:51.33]You alright?
[253:51.65]Why are you crying?
[253:54.48]Because I'm sad.
[253:56.04]What are you sad about?
[253:58.36]I don't know where Lord Sakuza is or what he's doing.
[254:03.54]It breaks my heart.
[254:05.34]If I can't see him, I'd at least like to know.
[254:09.34]But no matter how many letters I send, he never writes me back, and no one will tell me where he is.
[254:18.44]Actually, sir, can you tell me?
[254:23.17]Is it the guy that's following her around?
[254:26.49]I don't know.
[254:28.35]I don't know.
[254:28.81]She's gonna go like... I told you!
[254:32.25]I knew it!
[254:33.33]That's a slash.
[254:34.31]That is not a slash.
[254:53.00]Easy here.
[255:00.77]That's okay, it's a sweep, it's a sweep.
[255:05.16]Oh boy, oh boy, I just took a fucking big hit.
[255:07.52]That was a grab?
[255:08.24]I don't have any fucking clue.
[255:21.51]Oh my lord, it's like one, two, three, four, five.
[255:29.10]She has like illusions.
[255:34.80]Yikes.
[255:37.48]Okay, well lady, just relax for a second so I can... That's a gross, she has a sweep and a grab.
[255:45.16]You don't like the fire?
[255:48.54]What about...
[255:51.92]How about this?
[255:53.79]Okay, fireworks work every time.
[256:21.02]She's really, really good at this game.
[256:32.76]Damn it, I didn't get it.
[256:34.08]I'm starting to figure it out, a little bit.
[256:37.97]Alright, when she does that big swooping slash, she goes right into...
[256:53.02]Time to go.
[256:57.32]Easy, don't break the posture here.
[257:00.14]This one, hurry up.
[257:00.74]Here we go.
[257:04.96]Alright.
[257:05.32]Wait, are you gonna turn into like a fucking demon?
[257:07.04]Let's see what she does.
[257:15.80]It becomes like the broom.
[257:23.62]Shit, I didn't want to do that.
[257:30.23]Oh fuck.
[257:30.93]Bad, bad, bad.
[257:32.29]It's okay.
[257:36.35]Back it up.
[257:49.16]Alright, so she does that, like, the little spin around thing.
[257:51.48]I gotta be, it's a little weird.
[257:52.60]The timing's a little strange.
[258:16.62]Ooh, ow, ow, owie.
[258:19.73]Ow!
[258:19.95]Back up.
[258:53.00]Posture!
[258:53.64]Watch that posture!
[259:02.32]Fuck, man.
[259:07.06]I'm in trouble here.
[259:07.76]Yeah, I'm dead.
[259:13.92]Alright, well, I'm starting to figure it out.
[259:31.87]Her moveset is really, really interesting though.
[259:40.76]What the hell?
[260:06.90]Didn't get it?
[260:07.62]Yeah, I did.
[260:08.12]Alright, alright.
[260:19.83]It's all about that posture.
[260:28.26]Speaking of posture, watch out for yours.
[260:41.93]Fuck, she's gonna recover it faster than I am.
[260:52.82]Alright, come in.
[260:55.40]Aggressive!
[260:56.20]Don't let her get a move in.
[260:59.04]Oh my god, I wasn't even paying attention to my health!
[261:02.13]Whoa!
[261:02.69]I wasn't even looking at it.
[261:04.09]I wasn't paying any attention to it at all.
[261:05.81]I was zoned the fuck in.
[261:06.77]Holy shit.
[261:13.11]That was... fucking... what a mistake.
[261:14.61]You wanna know what's funny?
[261:18.71]My beer is directly in the way of the health bar.
[261:23.40]To a point where I can't see it.
[261:24.66]I'm gonna throw this thing... I'm gonna spike this into the wall behind me.
[261:34.39]I'm gonna fucking baseball throw this beer out of the way.
[261:50.98]I'm so tilted right now with this stupid fucking beer in my way.
[261:56.50]I'm about to baseball throw this into the wall.
[262:01.64]It was right in the spot where like I couldn't see the health bar.
[262:13.32]Get out of my fucking way.
[262:15.71]Jesus.
[262:26.12]Streamer can't move head to see health bar.
[262:28.46]You have to pay complete attention to everything that they're doing.
[262:31.14]Alright, fuck you lady.
[263:26.34]Alright, one down, one down.
[263:27.66]Don't make me baseball throw shit, come on.
[263:33.51]Really?
[263:37.69]Really?
[263:38.79]Give me a fucking two seconds, lady.
[263:42.79]I didn't block it.
[263:59.88]Fuck my posture!
[264:19.59]Come here.
[264:20.19]Don't let her... Just get right up in there.
[264:25.67]What do you got?
[264:26.17]You got nothing.
[264:31.01]You bitch.
[264:35.27]See, get.
[264:36.35]Slice.
[264:36.77]I'm so glad.
[264:45.88]Lord Sakusa brought me that man.
[264:49.64]Why are you still talking?
[264:53.76]And he's right over there.
[264:55.80]I don't get any beads?
[265:02.21]Okay, thank you.
[265:06.81]Curse vitality upon performing a... Didn't I already get this?
[265:23.11]What about this guy?
[265:25.11]Is he still here?
[265:32.10]Is that you?
[265:33.54]Yes.
[265:34.60]I must give you my thanks, Shinobi.
[265:38.44]Your thanks?
[265:39.56]You brought the shamisen player to me just a moment ago.
[265:45.83]She caressed me.
[265:49.74]Okay.
[265:50.06]So this guy gonna go home?
[266:05.52]Too bad for you.
[266:17.85]She was right around the corner.
[266:19.25]What do I get?
[266:21.25]Quest complete.
[266:25.86]Restore a node of resurrected power.
[266:28.88]Please take this cloth and use it to bundle those little ones that he may live on in peace.
[266:32.98]I am
[266:34.97]Dead?
[266:35.65]Does he get dead?
[266:44.51]Uh, quest complete.
[266:45.71]Thanks.
[266:51.16]Hit him?
[266:51.62]No, what if he comes back?
[266:57.26]Thanks for the baby.
[266:57.88]Uh, I'm gonna heal.
[267:08.92]Jerma doesn't give a shit if we backseat.
[267:11.32]Um... I mean, to an extent I do, right?
[267:13.50]Like, I don't want to see major game spoilers in here, and if you do, goodbye.
[267:20.49]You know what I mean?
[267:21.59]Like, pop out.
[267:31.73]But something like, hey, you know that if you consume that, then you get another Resurrective Power?
[267:38.44]I mean, that's fine.
[267:40.31]But don't tell me the fucking next boss.
[267:43.67]Or, you know, like... Goodbye.
[267:59.60]Uh, more wax.
[268:00.30]Cool, I need that.
[268:04.91]Alright, um...
[268:08.29]I see a potential cutscene over here.
[268:11.82]Wait.
[268:13.50]Oh.
[268:16.42]You should see my face right now.
[268:18.64]That was the most puckered-like face I've ever done.
[268:21.28]How do I get that?
[268:22.78]I gotta drop down from here?
[268:23.72]I don't think I can do it from there.
[268:27.68]Hold on.
[268:42.41]Oh, fuck.
[268:42.83]This guy's alive.
[268:50.00]I gotta stop doing that.
[268:50.88]I just do what my brain just does it.
[268:54.22]Okay, we got something going on over here.
[268:56.44]I need to get over here, though.
[269:00.55]That was loud.
[269:02.73]Got it.
[269:04.25]What's in it?
[269:05.99]What's in it?
[269:13.07]Okay.
[269:14.51]Divine Grass.
[269:15.51]It's very useful, as you saw in that ape fight.
[269:18.94]It's a pad.
[269:19.92]It's meant to be used.
[269:28.36]Now, how the hell am I going to get back up here?
[269:35.02]Let's wait.
[269:35.32]Is there something down here, too?
[269:36.27]I don't like it.
[269:41.38]Uh, no, this is the other way to go.
[269:43.02]Okay.
[269:53.56]So now... I guess... We're just gonna go across the bridge and see what's on the other side.
[270:07.17]I got a checkpoint right there.
[270:14.03]Okay.
[270:14.75]Nothing over there.
[270:24.17]How do I rate the game so far on a scale of 1 to 10?
[270:27.40]Hmm.
[270:29.06]Hmm.
[270:29.50]That's tricky.
[270:31.66]Hmm.
[270:32.44]It might be like a 7.
[270:38.37]Maybe like a 6.4.
[270:53.93]I'll be honest with you.
[270:54.79]I'll be completely honest.
[270:56.43]I'm not going to pretend to be like, it's a 9-8.
[271:00.17]I think this is like an 8-4 right now.
[271:09.53]I think it's an 8-4 at the moment.
[271:19.78]The swamp brought it down to a 70, because it was like a 90.
[271:24.14]I told you, if there was a swamp in the game, I was going to give it a -2 letter grades, and I did.
[271:30.84]None of these people are even worth my time, so... Sneak over this way.
[271:39.12]It has since, from the two letter grades, come up to about an 84.
[271:43.96]We'll see how the game continues.
[271:47.14]Oh, shit.
[271:48.00]Can I get in here?
[272:03.19]Ow!
[272:05.47]I'm just looking for like a... I'm just looking for a way to get that item.
[272:09.41]Okay?
[272:11.00]And... I'm just an item sicko.
[272:19.28]I'm sorry, guys.
[272:19.88]I can't get up that.
[272:24.76]Yes, I can.
[272:30.56]Come on.
[272:35.13]You've got like a double jump on a wall and I can't grab that.
[272:45.64]Well, fine.
[272:46.56]Okay.
[272:47.84]No, I didn't want to do that.
[272:49.06]I gotta go all the way around.
[272:55.07]How much further can I... There's gotta be a way to grab something over here.
[272:58.47]I want that item.
[273:00.47]Fuck.
[273:03.69]Oh, fuck it.
[273:04.31]Whatever.
[273:04.59]You don't have to get everything in the game.
[273:05.77]I could probably wrap around there anyways.
[273:28.93]This is... There's something here.
[273:33.76]There it is.
[273:35.58]Okay.
[273:36.94]Um, hi.
[273:46.38]Alright.
[273:51.00]You are illusion- cannot- what about those- hold on.
[273:53.78]Wait just a minute.
[273:54.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[273:54.99]That's a sweep?
[273:55.61]Hold on.
[273:57.39]Uh, what about these?
[273:59.17]Oops.
[274:04.33]He looks like an illusion.
[274:05.84]Let me just see what happens here.
[274:34.27]Not a terrible moveset so far.
[274:38.19]Although, these do swing a lot.
[274:41.85]How do you- fireworks?
[274:42.61]How do you do fireworks?
[274:44.47]Fireworks is as effective as the snap-beat things.
[274:46.37]Oops, I didn't block that.
[274:51.62]Ooh, that's a thrust!
[275:00.26]Different.
[275:01.62]Fucking different moves!
[275:03.06]Okay!
[275:14.01]What's this?
[275:15.93]What's the hand mean?
[275:27.50]I blocked it.
[275:27.90]Now that was a sweep.
[275:28.70]Oh shit!
[275:39.14]Fuck.
[275:40.90]They don't have very much time at all.
[275:48.58]Damn it.
[275:49.30]That's hard to read.
[275:54.84]Not terrible, though.
[276:13.17]I got a feeling this is gonna be Phase 1.
[276:30.11]Shit, that was a sweep.
[276:32.59]That was a sweep.
[276:40.61]Shit.
[276:41.17]Fuck, I gotta get that down.
[276:44.68]Fuck you.
[276:55.22]That's just... You got too many movesets, man.
[277:08.44]What a fantastic camera you have in this video game.
[277:11.18]It's like the best.
[277:11.96]It's the best camera I've ever seen.
[277:15.08]But the best I've ever used.
[277:17.26]Better than Mario 64, I'll tell you.
[277:42.71]Hurt him all, too.
[277:43.53]How many pellets?
[277:49.25]I think I do.
[277:51.21]Damn.
[278:08.38]What's phase two?
[278:09.32]Let's see it!
[278:27.52]Am I getting baited here?
[278:35.77]Okay.
[278:37.91]Corrupted bunk watched over the cave entrance.
[278:41.89]Breathing technique.
[278:47.97]Allows one to dive underwater as well as breathe underwater indefinitely.
[278:52.11]Oh man.
[278:53.13]I can dive underwater?
[279:03.47]Good night.
[279:16.38]Oh, best camera I've ever seen in my life.
[279:18.80]That's true, though.
[279:19.50]Come on.
[279:19.78]Give me a break.
[279:24.01]It just went right into his pelvis for five straight seconds.
[279:37.85]So that means every pool of water can now be... Oh, man.
[279:44.75]Don't do this to me.
[279:45.37]Now I gotta go check every pool of water.
[279:52.18]Camera's not that bad.
[279:54.50]No, it's not.
[279:55.18]But in a game like this that requires such pinpoint focus, something like that can ruin an attempt.
[280:04.16]Like the camera going like... Like zooming straight into the front of your face.
[280:08.98]And you can't see the animations they're doing.
[280:10.68]That could ruin an entire attempt.
[280:13.21]And then I would just complain about it and I'd blame the camera.
[280:15.27]Good thing I didn't have to do that.
[280:25.71]How would you have the camera behind you and in a corner?
[280:27.65]Spin around and show it from a bird's eye.
[280:31.12]I'm serious.
[280:31.82]Have it come up and have it be a bird's eye like isometric camera for like two seconds.
[280:38.28]And spin in circles.
[280:47.49]I'm fucking kidding.
[280:49.11]It's hard to do that.
[280:50.85]You have a game engine, right?
[280:53.84]That's not easy to do.
[280:54.68]I don't know what it is.
[280:57.50]That doesn't mean I'm not gonna complain about it sometimes.
[281:06.57]Make the obstacles transparent has been a staple for years.
[281:11.59]Yeah, I mean, I guess you could do a thing where... Like, for instance, like this.
[281:15.55]If... When the camera... The camera could essentially just... I don't know how you would do it, but... Because this sucks, right?
[281:22.39]It's too close.
[281:23.13]And if the guy's in front of me, he's taking up the whole screen, and it's like, Oh, shit!
[281:25.97]I gotta get out of the hole!
[281:26.71]So I'm gonna figure it out in, like, a hundred years.
[281:39.57]Anyways.
[281:41.06]That was fun.
[281:42.80]That was a really fun fight.
[281:43.70]It was just... That was all about just timing the parries and the sweeps.
[281:51.69]That was a couple of fun fights in a row.
[281:55.57]Alright, we've gone from... It's like an 86 now.
[282:04.30]What's the flower in here?
[282:09.64]What's it like being a lost vegan?
[282:11.06]I don't know what that means.
[282:16.50]Is this another boss?
[282:27.81]There it is.
[282:28.17]A stone found in an altar deep within the village of the water dwellers.
[282:31.92]Stones will sometimes appear in the bodies of those who have long drank from the waters.
[282:37.70]Step into the marital stone and offer the fragment as Chris's stone.
[282:40.99]One of the incense ingredients sought by the Divine Heir for immoral severance.
[282:47.43]Cool.
[282:52.78]So I have the other ingredient.
[282:55.26]What happened in here?
[283:00.28]I like this area.
[283:00.88]I almost wish I could have fought that guy in here.
[283:18.26]Just checking.
[283:18.84]Just checking.
[283:24.88]Ape incoming.
[283:26.24]Yeah.
[283:29.03]Wouldn't that be something?
[283:30.75]If I had to fight the headless ape again.
[283:32.27]Alright, I can just go back.
[283:34.99]Because this is part of storyline quest item shit.
[283:56.61]I think that's all I can do here.
[283:59.02]Something that this game does that all the other ones that they've ever made don't do is a lot of the mini-boss, mini-boss, boss.
[284:07.76]They don't really give you any time at all.
[284:08.94]Alright, what do you think?
[284:11.05]You got a second?
[284:11.63]Nope.
[284:12.85]There's another fight.
[284:15.95]I actually, I like it though.
[284:35.59]Alright.
[284:42.45]This looks wrong.
[284:59.00]Wake him.
[285:01.12]I got the other ingredient.
[285:04.26]I found that stone.
[285:22.13]A fragrant stone enshrined in a village within the depths of Ashina.
[285:25.15]One must throw oneself for it to be found.
[285:27.45]With this, the Fountainhead fragrance is complete.
[285:29.53]Let us depart now to the divine realm.
[285:33.55]What is it, Wolf?
[285:36.17]What is that strangely shaped rock you hold?
[285:38.55]I got it right now.
[285:39.17]Is that the fragrant stone of the Fountainhead?
[285:42.18]My lord, this stone appeared to have been enshrined.
[285:46.18]Yes.
[285:47.42]It is just as the book described.
[285:49.66]Yes.
[285:51.04]There was also an inscription, a sweetly scented bridal offering, written on the altar.
[285:56.69]Bridal?
[285:57.99]Hmm.
[285:58.93]What sort of place was this?
[286:01.07]It was in a cave.
[286:02.47]The place was a fucking dump, that's all I remember.
[286:05.33]In that case, where was the wedding procession headed?
[286:08.59]No way to know, I guess.
[286:10.99]Sweetly scented.
[286:13.32]Lord Kurok.
[286:14.88]That place might be the gateway to the divine realm.
[286:19.63]This is a nice length of game too.
[286:27.37]Because how long have I been streaming so far?
[286:35.61]I see you've gathered some of the ingredients needed to create the aroma of the Fountainhead.
[286:40.95]Just about five hours.
[286:45.46]So, what is it, 8 hours the first time, 9 hours the first time, 8 hours... 17, like, 18, 19, 20, we're like 22 hours in.
[286:55.32]And I'm still, it's still a game here.
[286:59.82]That's cool.
[287:00.24]Yeah, I already heard this.
[287:05.15]Alright, so, where the fuck do I go?
[287:06.59]The door marked with the outline of a person.
[287:15.93]Do I have anything else?
[287:19.01]Fuck, okay.
[287:22.37]I'm glad you've come, Master.
[287:23.79]Don't have any seeds.
[287:28.59]Master Wolk, it looks as if your brow is less furrowed than before, if only a little.
[287:36.40]Please, see that Lord Kuro's wish to sever immortality is met.
[287:44.89]Okay, ancient text.
[287:49.15]I don't really know what you want me to do with this.
[287:58.04]I got it, though.
[288:02.88]The power of key waters in a deep pool.
[288:10.23]I gotta start diving around, probably.
[288:16.07]Um... Thank you.
[288:22.77]What door are you talking about?
[288:24.15]The door with the outline?
[288:28.41]I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
[288:29.91]What do we got?
[288:36.66]Outskirts.
[288:38.02]Castle.
[288:41.90]This dungeon.
[288:42.68]I could go back and try to kill...
[288:46.24]Yeah, hold on a minute here.
[288:50.22]Watering hole.
[288:52.41]Let me go fight some of these.
[288:54.05]There's a couple of mini-bosses that I want to take down.
[288:57.71]Let me go back here.
[289:01.13]Let me go fight the headless ape thing.
[289:12.79]Let's go down.
[289:13.47]He was down here, right?
[289:20.66]Somewhere down here is this guy.
[289:22.28]There you are.
[289:24.20]Okay.
[289:26.78]What do you got?
[289:29.31]You.
[289:29.65]I'm looking at you.
[289:30.71]First of all, what am I thinking here?
[289:34.69]Because I'm going to just jump down on top of you.
[289:38.82]If I can.
[289:42.46]No, we don't need crutches.
[289:43.60]Let's fucking go.
[289:50.29]I was going to say you're done, but... That's terrible.
[289:59.11]I can't dodge here.
[290:09.27]No dodging allowed against this guy.
[290:11.05]Oh, my health.
[290:14.13]I wasn't looking at my health again.
[290:16.49]Ha ha ha ha.
[290:19.08]The most important thing in the game, and I'm just like, yeah, I guess he does damage even if you bury him.
[290:24.20]That's why I'm not paying attention to it.
[290:28.57]Um... I might have to use an item here.
[290:42.09]That chip damage is insane.
[290:45.03]Yeah, I'll do this again.
[290:46.36]I have that item that stops all illusions, right?
[290:50.48]Holy fuck, that was a one-hit kill.
[291:02.65]Let's see, that's... Oh my god.
[291:04.43]I might have to use another one of my things.
[291:09.13]Let's see here.
[291:17.11]Made for driving away apparations.
[291:30.28]Hmm.
[291:33.28]Well, that dude looks like an apparation.
[291:35.78]If I was an apparation, that's who I would be.
[291:47.40]Let's give it a try.
[291:52.92]Uh, where the fuck was he?
[291:54.60]Over here.
[291:59.26]Divine Confetti Snapseed.
[292:06.89]Yeah, that's all I, I just, that's all I got.
[292:08.49]I wonder if it's, what about, does Snapseed work?
[292:18.76]I'm scared to use this.
[292:19.68]I feel like this is an item I can't get.
[292:30.63]Okay, so I got Pacifying Divine Confetti.
[292:35.33]Let's see what happens.
[292:44.30]I just kind of scratched my ass for a second.
[293:02.69]Let me reach in my pocket and let- Nope, sorry.
[293:07.26]Oh, eat my fucking ass.
[293:16.30]Hold on, you want to use this item?
[293:17.63]Let me get it and use.
[293:36.49]Uh... I don't... What the fuck?
[293:42.13]What the fuck?
[293:43.11]I don't even know what this is supposed to be doing!
[293:45.33]What?
[293:50.60]I get it, okay.
[293:51.38]I thought... For a second, I thought it was gonna get rid of, like, the illusions.
[293:55.00]I thought it was gonna get rid of this shit.
[293:56.38]I didn't... Oh my god.
[293:57.60]Give me a fucking break.
[294:01.20]I didn't know it coded my sword.
[294:02.57]I thought it was, like, a thing where it got rid of the mist or something.
[294:07.99]Really?
[294:19.98]It doesn't say that it coats your weapon.
[294:22.57]It just said it drives away operations.
[294:37.01]Fucking god damn it.
[294:40.21]So I'm gonna do this before I even go in here.
[294:42.01]He's gonna teleport behind me.
[294:43.97]How long does it last?
[294:44.91]Oh my god.
[295:14.69]This terror builder is fucking killing me.
[295:25.96]Dude, that happened so fast.
[295:27.52]Give me a break.
[295:27.94]You don't even get a tenth of a second to do that.
[295:29.58]Holy shit, this guy sucks.
[295:32.71]You don't even get like a quarter of a second to react to that.
[295:48.72]What the fuck?
[295:56.68]I'm not gonna use all these items.
[295:58.37]This is gonna be fucking miserable.
[296:13.31]I'm dead.
[296:13.81]Fucking Jesus Christ!
[296:17.13]Oh my god, this is just... I hate this.
[296:28.32]Dude, that terror buildup if he touches you fucking once... He's gonna fucking be behind me!
[296:44.47]I hate this shit.
[296:45.71]I hate this guy.
[296:50.78]Oh my god.
[296:51.52]Oh my god.
[296:52.44]This is the worst boss in the whole game.
[296:55.94]I hate this so much.
[296:57.42]I have to beat this though.
[296:59.22]Holy fuck.
[296:59.74]This is bringing me to like a 6 or a 7 right now.
[297:10.39]This motherfucker is going to bring me to like an 8.
[297:15.30]This is my last attempt on him.
[297:16.68]Fucking terror.
[297:29.15]Dude.
[297:30.27]I'm almost dead again.
[297:31.99]He's gonna stab me.
[297:35.29]Nah.
[297:35.71]Nah, fuck this game.
[297:36.92]Fuck this boss.
[297:37.64]This is stupid.
[297:45.14]Like, this eats shit.
[298:01.08]It still builds terror even when you fucking walk!
[298:03.94]I'm dead here, man!
[298:05.08]I'm fucking dead!
[298:26.83]I got no more.
[298:27.45]I got one more.
[298:28.15]Oh my fucking Jesus Christ.
[298:50.70]Fuck that guy.
[298:51.38]I'm never fighting that guy again.
[298:53.58]I'd rather just piss down on his head right now.
[298:59.12]What a waste of fucking items.
[299:13.61]Oh, fuck that enemy.
[299:15.91]That just brought it down to a 7-2.
[299:22.39]That's a 7-2 now.
[299:23.45]It is.
[299:23.63]Alright, where do I have to go?
[299:40.50]Pool?
[299:48.36]Doesn't want to learn how to beat- No, I know how to beat him!
[299:50.64]It's just the terror buildup.
[299:52.75]The fact that you can't dodge.
[299:54.89]You can't dodge.
[299:56.15]And the terror buildup, even when you block.
[299:58.23]I know you have to parry, but his moves are fucking hard to parry because he's such a slow motherfucker, right?
[300:02.73]That's a hard fucking encounter.
[300:04.25]Fuck that encounter.
[300:09.61]You locked in place.
[300:11.06]You need a special item to fight him.
[300:14.56]Oh, poop in that guy's fucking mouth.
[300:16.58]Seriously.
[300:17.06]Uh, this... I need to... Where is it?
[300:27.93]Why would I want to go into poison water?
[300:43.58]That's not a pause?
[300:56.71]Maybe the castle.
[300:57.51]I really just don't know.
[301:14.40]Maybe here?
[301:14.94]This is a body of water.
[301:21.36]I don't know if I can do anything here.
[301:23.05]Nah, it's not deep enough.
[301:38.04]Alright, hold on.
[301:42.98]Can I go?
[301:45.33]What does this bring me?
[301:46.35]I think this is back out.
[301:51.61]Yeah, this is where I got the flower.
[302:11.40]Okay, dive?
[302:12.12]Okay.
[302:16.49]Something under here.
[302:28.08]Dive down?
[302:29.34]Precious bait.
[302:32.42]Ring the bell, drop the bait.
[302:35.04]What the hell does that mean?
[302:40.48]Alright, well I got bait.
[302:52.96]Let's keep looking at other bodies of water.
[303:09.55]Wouldn't there be water around here somewhere?
[303:11.35]At the very beginning of the game, there's a ton of water, right?
[303:31.49]Okay, into the water.
[303:37.24]This is water, right?
[303:38.46]That's not the water.
[303:42.16]I thought that was water.
[303:43.86]It's not.
[303:44.82]Alright.
[303:45.14]Okay, here we go.
[303:54.45]Is there any water to dive in here?
[303:59.02]No, but did... Uh, okay.
[304:12.02]Didn't get that before, apparently.
[304:19.31]Uh, nothing's deep enough here.
[304:28.76]Fuck that guy Um
[304:55.12]I really have no idea.
[304:55.86]I'm just gonna keep looking for bodies of water.
[304:59.49]I guess.
[305:02.83]I don't know where the hell to go.
[305:05.65]Uh... I could have sworn there was water, like, over here.
[305:38.80]Is there something over here?
[305:51.39]No, I'm just making sure I'm not missing something like on the other side or something.
[306:10.69]I think I have to kill people.
[306:14.03]This one.
[306:40.41]Alright.
[306:44.77]Water?
[306:45.13]I see water.
[306:48.55]Let's check it.
[307:00.98]Can you drown?
[307:08.38]I hope not.
[307:09.14]What about down here?
[307:14.81]Treasure Carp Scale.
[307:23.47]Uh, I... Think I'm going the right way?
[307:29.54]I don't know.
[307:30.16]I... This is still going.
[307:36.50]Where am I now?
[307:49.40]I don't... I think... Well, I've been here before.
[308:26.51]Let's see, what over here?
[308:33.31]Water down here?
[308:36.98]No, this is the... What?
[308:54.32]The key to a samurai gatehouse located in the reservoir not far from the well the wolf is kept in.
[309:02.20]Here, Gyoubi the Demon's broken horn is guarded by Ashina Samurai.
[309:05.66]The broken horn is a spear blade- What?
[309:12.83]Uh, why did I just- I've killed these guys before!
[309:17.85]I killed these guys like 16 hours ago in game time and I didn't get that key?
[309:34.61]OK.
[309:49.78]Is there a better way for me to take this on?
[309:53.35]I don't think so.
[310:19.88]Whoa, he's gonna try to catch me!
[310:22.84]Oh my god, how many times does he do this?!
[310:24.44]What the fuck?!
[310:45.58]Oh my god!
[310:48.24]You psycho!
[310:52.80]I thought I was... That's... Does the bar have to be so tiny?
[310:57.71]Like, look at that.
[310:58.27]It's hard to tell if it's falling off.
[311:03.00]That takes up, like, fucking not even a quarter of a percent of the real estate on the screen.
[311:21.76]Oh my god.
[311:22.58]That little tiny baby fingernail posture bar.
[311:30.02]Can I make that even 5% bigger?
[311:31.46]OK.
[311:55.23]Well, this is a new zone.
[311:57.09]I guess.
[311:59.72]He seems heated.
[312:00.50]Oh, I am.
[312:01.34]I can't get that fucking stupid headless dumb fuckface enemy out of my mind.
[312:06.60]I hate that thing.
[312:08.06]I wish I could go into the game's code and delete it.
[312:09.88]Okay.
[312:31.12]Everyone's always hiding under these little sheets.
[312:33.56]Oh shit.
[312:33.78]Didn't somebody have the other half of this?
[313:02.29]What do you get for doing this?
[313:15.54]How many do I have?
[313:16.24]Two?
[313:21.00]I don't even have remotely enough money to do it.
[313:28.56]What do I have for money?
[313:33.84]5, 10, 15, 20.
[313:34.22]I got 2,000.
[313:35.34]I'm not sure anything.
[313:46.27]Maybe this is worth buying.
[313:48.81]Just to have another one.
[313:57.54]I'm going to buy this.
[313:59.52]Why not?
[314:03.98]So I got 150.
[314:05.12]Let's go.
[314:05.64]I need one more.
[314:19.87]And I'll buy two of these.
[314:24.66]Thank you for your business.
[314:41.35]Down we go.
[314:42.23]Let's go down.
[314:45.71]What was the indicator that I just had?
[314:46.87]Abandoned dungeon.
[314:57.60]I don't want you to touch me, okay?
[315:06.26]And he touched me.
[315:07.05]He got on top of me.
[315:07.99]He's...
[315:09.92]Alright.
[315:12.82]You wanna see my face?
[315:19.91]You don't wanna see my face.
[315:21.59]Trust me.
[315:31.49]What are you doing here?
[315:34.47]Of all places.
[315:38.93]Ah, are you perhaps a shinobi?
[315:42.65]Uh-oh.
[315:44.75]Do I answer, or what do I say to this?
[315:51.13]I wonder if this guy is.
[315:54.59]That's right.
[315:55.50]I thought so.
[315:56.02]Might you be willing to take on a favor for me?
[315:59.38]I am Dojun.
[316:01.04]I've been tasked with the preparation of a medical treatment using the rejuvenating waters.
[316:05.84]I'll get to the point, my dear shinobi.
[316:08.41]Okay.
[316:08.61]One tough man.
[316:08.99]One tough man.
[316:30.33]Okay.
[316:31.33]I don't get it.
[316:32.05]One tough man.
[316:32.71]Is this a tough man?
[316:33.47]I can't go behind him.
[316:34.09]I can go down.
[316:34.71]Okay, I'll give you that item.
[316:59.66]Oil!
[317:00.96]Oil!
[317:03.86]Hey!
[317:05.52]Hey!
[317:05.98]Stop it!
[317:09.62]Leave me the heck alone!
[317:16.67]What's over here?
[317:23.13]Terror agent.
[317:25.51]Sure.
[317:38.58]Red lump?
[317:39.82]Consume to gain red eyes and reduce flinching from enemy attacks.
[317:44.03]But you can't resurrect.
[317:44.95]Shit, okay.
[317:49.23]That's an interesting item, alright.
[317:59.13]Hello?
[318:02.05]Just these idiots.
[318:02.75]Oh.
[318:07.47]If I was under the exception, I'd have a chance after hitting them.
[318:10.81]Allegedly not!
[318:13.63]Don't.
[318:13.95]Like, there's no way.
[318:14.43]Ah, there's no way for me to dodge.
[318:19.29]These guys come back to life, it looks like, yeah.
[318:24.28]Well, I'll take this.
[318:24.96]Oh.
[318:32.04]Huh?
[318:33.22]Huh?
[318:38.75]Is there a reason why I can't?
[318:44.45]Water.
[318:44.87]We can dive under here.
[318:49.03]Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[318:50.26]Alright.
[318:59.40]Anything down here?
[319:05.79]Yes, there is.
[319:07.83]Three items we got.
[319:09.45]Coin purse.
[319:12.85]Good.
[319:13.55]300 gold.
[319:13.79]I'll take it.
[319:16.62]Shard.
[319:18.78]I'm not going to go under there just yet.
[319:20.18]Hold on.
[319:30.90]Where are we at?
[319:40.38]What the hell were you throwing at me?
[319:41.30]Was that a piece of dust?
[319:42.89]Oh, he has a gun, right.
[319:50.59]I didn't realize you had a gun.
[319:54.39]Feet cam.
[319:54.99]Why would I do a feet cam?
[319:57.65]No, I'm not gonna fucking do a feet cam.
[320:00.25]Uh... Ghost guy?
[320:06.39]Ghost samurai?
[320:35.79]That was a lot of experience for this guy.
[320:39.17]Operate mechanism.
[320:48.11]Turn on the wheel?
[320:51.96]Going up.
[321:20.53]What?
[321:23.17]Can I help you?
[321:33.97]Buckethead 3?
[321:34.63]That sounded like the kid.
[321:42.52]I think I'm going fucking crazy.
[321:45.79]They have abandoned their fate, seduced by a search for immortality.
[321:53.32]Should you be captured, there is no telling what would become of you.
[322:00.06]You would do well to return the way you came.
[322:09.65]However... I will not stop you from entering, if you are determined to do so.
[322:18.99]Please?
[322:24.48]Is there anything else you got for me?
[322:27.64]Proceed with care, I'm not gonna stop you.
[322:30.14]Alright, well, I have an idol right here.
[322:34.40]Okay, you're gonna pray for my safety.
[322:56.60]Okay.
[322:59.79]Senfu Temple, Mount Kongo.
[323:17.61]Who do I go for?
[323:18.53]The guy on the bridge or guy sitting down?
[323:21.69]Can I talk to this person?
[323:30.48]They left me here.
[323:33.34]Where did everyone go?
[323:35.79]Why did you leave Kotaro behind?
[323:38.91]Now what do I do?
[323:42.33]Why are you crying?
[323:43.85]Everyone's gone.
[323:45.55]I'm all alone.
[323:47.35]Who's everyone?
[323:48.99]He's a baby.
[323:50.67]Huh?
[323:52.03]Who?
[323:56.41]Look at that fat.
[323:59.88]He looks like a couch cushion.
[324:02.02]Only one pure white flower.
[324:06.00]The pure white flower I cannot find.
[324:10.30]What?
[324:12.61]My head hurts.
[324:14.95]Sorry.
[324:16.45]I have...
[324:18.89]Alright.
[324:34.92]Scrap iron.
[324:37.08]I need, like, two more gunpowder, right?
[324:38.78]And I could've... Go back and upgrade my flame thing again.
[324:48.34]What are we doing on the bridge?
[324:50.78]This is an enemy.
[324:51.66]Should I just kill him?
[324:54.32]I'm just gonna kill this guy.
[324:55.90]It's a beautiful zone.
[325:21.39]Wait, let me take a look.
[325:22.05]What's over here?
[325:22.57]Ooh, there's a kite.
[325:54.00]Fly kite.
[326:08.41]Let it go.
[326:25.51]What the fuck is going on?
[326:26.93]Let go?
[326:27.39]I can't.
[326:32.09]Why can't I let go of this?
[326:50.24]Is this a part of the game?
[327:03.65]Well, uh, thanks to somebody in chat, I had to press E on the keyboard.
[327:14.44]Alright, well I don't know what that does.
[327:15.58]That would have been so lame if I just got stuck there forever.
[327:36.91]Helpful one guy.
[327:38.13]Yeah.
[327:49.00]You guys are saying that these guys were peaceful.
[327:50.74]That's not true.
[327:56.32]These guys are clearly fucking trying to kill me.
[328:00.82]Oops.
[328:04.48]Wrong button.
[328:08.33]Jesus man!
[328:13.97]They were peaceful until you trespassed.
[328:24.40]Let's sneak up on this guy.
[328:46.03]Oh boy.
[328:46.81]Okay.
[328:52.73]This is not a place I want to be!
[329:02.53]Oh, fuck.
[329:03.01]Watch out for the... Get.
[329:05.70]Fuck.
[329:06.38]Get.
[329:07.10]I... Oh, not good.
[329:09.78]Oh, boy.
[329:16.91]How the hell was I supposed to know there were three dudes over here?
[329:38.06]OK.
[329:56.16]If shitload of them are up there, I probably shouldn't go head on.
[330:06.58]Let's go this way.
[330:15.03]There's the front of the temple.
[330:18.33]Big Marsh 5 community subs.
[330:19.89]Thank you, Big Marsh.
[330:24.61]Big subs from Big Marsh.
[330:28.88]No, thank you for real.
[330:33.03]Antidote power!
[330:34.27]Antidote power!
[330:35.67]Who are you?
[330:36.51]You're like a ghost version of the... Oh boy, this is not good.
[330:57.81]This is so not good.
[330:59.71]God.
[331:00.73]Is there another one here?
[331:01.81]Is it three?
[331:03.31]This is not three, right?
[331:06.61]No.
[331:07.27]This is not so bad.
[331:27.32]Oh my goodness, holy fuck, that guy did like 80% of my health in one hit.
[331:32.61]What the fuck?
[331:33.43]No comment, you got overdone.
[331:59.96]Alright, alright, alright.
[332:01.12]Settle down, settle down.
[332:02.28]Alright, where are we at?
[332:28.53]I don't think I can fight all these guys at the same time.
[332:30.66]I can go up there, but... Can I even go in the front door?
[332:55.10]I don't think I can even open this door.
[333:04.93]Can I get... Why does it look like I could go up there?
[333:09.64]Can I not make it to the roof from here?
[333:24.55]Yeah, look, I can get up... Let me get up here.
[333:29.07]We're pretty set up.
[333:36.29]Oh.
[333:39.12]Maybe there's not even a reason for me to do that.
[333:40.58]Just, no, fuck it.
[333:41.36]I'm just gonna go.
[333:46.30]Might as well, right?
[333:54.09]I'm in the house.
[333:55.19]I've made it.
[334:01.72]Oh, sh- God.
[334:02.72]This is all, like, prayer.
[334:05.54]There's like five people in here doing prayers.
[334:09.17]Oh... You guys got a fucking roach problem.
[334:16.09]Get some like- get the orchid man in here for crying out loud.
[334:19.03]Jesus.
[334:20.49]Oh, come on!
[334:21.39]Oh!
[334:24.45]Oh!
[334:25.27]There's a huge guy there too.
[334:27.05]Um, who are- I got a gourd seed.
[334:30.65]Should I- should I not have done that?
[334:38.30]Um, alright.
[334:39.92]No.
[334:44.34]Gourd Seed and... Pick up the fucking item!
[334:52.10]This is not good.
[334:52.84]This is very bad.
[334:53.34]Window right here.
[335:06.14]Out the window.
[335:07.87]Somebody to talk to.
[335:09.99]You guys can't get out here, right?
[335:11.29]No, I'm safe.
[335:12.69]Good to go.
[335:21.80]Can I cheese this?
[335:22.40]I better believe I can.
[335:32.88]Maybe not.
[335:36.76]Well, let's just see what you have to say.
[335:38.10]Motherfucker.
[335:49.39]Motherfucker.
[335:50.93]Fuck off!
[335:51.53]No!
[336:09.80]What am I gonna do about this?
[336:21.68]Burn!
[336:41.77]Well I maybe I just You know, you gotta do what you gotta do
[336:59.51]How are you still alive?
[337:00.41]How is that person still living?
[337:01.71]What the hell?
[337:14.44]Of course he's a cockroach.
[337:17.26]Okay, can I lose him?
[337:21.40]Talk.
[337:21.62]There are two kinds.
[337:23.66]One is fresh.
[337:24.16]The other is dried.
[337:24.98]It's over there.
[337:26.02]The fresh one's over there.
[337:27.06]Over the cliff.
[337:27.56]Through the hole.
[337:28.38]That's where you'll find it.
[337:29.28]Fresh, what are you talking about?
[337:30.58]Something troubling you.
[337:31.34]For rice for me, that's the way.
[337:33.00]Rice, I say.
[337:33.77]If something is troubling you in your mind, bless me with rice any time.
[337:37.59]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[337:38.55]Have any rice?
[337:39.01]Rice from the Divine Child.
[337:39.77]Alright.
[337:48.33]Why am I panicking?
[337:48.87]Because I have to read that fast or someone will throw a rock at me.
[338:00.57]Okay, so this... I feel like there's a lot going on in this zone.
[338:15.24]What's up here?
[338:21.84]Can I do anything from here?
[338:23.04]I mean look it up across the way, but I don't think I can get over there from here.
[338:55.46]Should I go for it?
[339:00.85]I mean, I don't know what the... I put the kite out, but I had to pull it back.
[339:07.83]No, that's not gonna do anything.
[339:09.99]I can go up there.
[339:10.64]I need... a bonfire or something.
[339:15.00]Because this is bad.
[339:17.60]I'm almost dead.
[339:32.20]Um, I guess I'm gonna go over here?
[339:35.43]I guess.
[339:59.96]No, I tried to jump across and it just didn't.
[340:04.86]Oh, now I'm fucked.
[340:11.22]I'm gonna try this way.
[340:33.82]I don't know.
[340:46.59]I have no idea.
[340:51.60]Is that a mini-boss?
[340:52.70]No, it's not.
[341:05.66]Can you see me?
[341:13.08]Whoa, you can burn everything here.
[341:14.50]Oh, you're new.
[341:34.45]Hello.
[341:38.46]What the hell is that?
[341:39.32]Rust?
[341:53.46]Jesus.
[341:54.78]Oh, no.
[341:56.38]Okay, yeah, good luck.
[341:57.50]No, thanks.
[342:00.32]There's another one.
[342:01.14]There's two.
[342:02.96]Oh, you motherfucker.
[342:05.38]Why?
[342:08.16]Oh.
[342:18.72]This is far away.
[342:19.92]I am at the very beginning.
[342:29.26]Oh, shit.
[342:34.11]Alright, that's fun.
[342:35.01]It's fun having the indicator there and when I jump, it just disappears.
[342:37.97]It's not there anymore.
[342:39.43]That's great.
[342:40.01]I love it.
[342:40.69]It's my favorite thing about the game.
[343:00.20]Which way?
[343:00.52]I don't even remember which way it was.
[343:01.70]It was like around the corner, right?
[343:02.81]I don't even know.
[343:04.53]Yep, it was up here.
[343:11.83]Through here!
[343:12.63]Through the woods!
[343:20.00]Alright, forget about the cockroaches.
[343:24.27]Just get through here.
[343:38.09]Alright, skip this guy, jump across, and then, I don't know, we're gonna fight the alien that's in the temple.
[343:51.20]I'm not even entirely sure I can get across from here.
[343:56.43]We're gonna go this way.
[343:57.73]Alright, I guess, maybe?
[344:07.93]Let's try this.
[344:09.07]Well, found it.
[344:10.07]Ooh.
[344:14.61]Alright.
[344:27.65]Let me check down here first.
[344:39.37]Somebody, ooh, almost got dropped on.
[344:41.67]You gonna come this way?
[344:45.87]No, no, no, dude.
[345:10.63]Oh, sugar.
[345:19.13]Can I go this way?
[345:32.56]Watch that health.
[345:47.06]Okay.
[345:49.16]Around the corner.
[345:50.78]No.
[345:50.90]I'm almost at the top of this damn mountain.
[345:54.56]What's up here?
[345:58.02]Oh.
[346:01.00]What an idiot.
[346:02.54]That's the first enemy in the entire game to do that.
[346:06.77]No other enemy has done that.
[346:09.35]He's the first one.
[346:15.60]And he didn't even mean to.
[346:16.52]That wasn't even cool.
[346:25.64]Alright, I seem to have made it.
[346:37.37]Kind of.
[346:37.71]And I mean really kind of.
[346:57.28]Let's see.
[346:58.58]Red and white Pinwheel.
[347:02.49]Everyone's right here.
[347:06.15]Pinwheel, that's... I don't know what this is for, but there's... I hope I don't die to that thing.
[347:34.29]Yeah, fuck this.
[347:35.89]Yeah.
[347:36.17]Okay.
[347:36.41]Yeah, really I wonder if I'm gonna be safe For the sake of my God damn it Oh
[348:08.41]What's that Voodoo?
[348:08.97]I don't know what that is.
[348:09.61]He's doing something weird.
[348:18.63]Check out that fucking posture.
[348:20.05]Easy.
[348:21.59]Oh, it hurts.
[348:22.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[348:24.16]Oh.
[348:38.50]I timed it to it is gonna get it didn't get it didn't get it didn't get it didn't get it fuck I had it to fuck you I Had it Get out of here What
[349:07.52]Well, that's... I'm not entirely sure what to do.
[349:14.73]I gotta knock him off the cliff.
[349:17.45]That's very clear, right?
[349:18.93]Knock him off the cliff.
[349:20.89]Goodbye.
[349:37.01]Yeah!
[349:41.77]Did somebody just say I read chat?
[349:43.61]How the hell would I do that during that fight?
[349:45.21]Why don't you just peer over here and just take a look at what you guys did?
[349:48.19]What?
[349:49.15]No, he's like breaking the sides.
[349:50.99]How would I read fucking chat during that?
[350:00.60]Very clearly, these things would be exploding around us.
[350:08.76]Well, I knew that was not going to be so easy.
[350:17.66]And that might be the spot to call it for tonight.
[350:30.63]Because that probably puts us... No, maybe not yet.
[350:37.08]Not yet.
[350:49.39]I'm right here.
[350:54.64]Let me... Okay, let me enhance my attributes.
[351:01.20]We'll go for a little longer.
[351:15.45]Okay.
[351:16.63]So that puts me here.
[351:21.20]Probably have to get up that way.
[351:22.36]Let me just see if there's anything else over this way.
[351:26.02]There is.
[351:36.68]Who?
[351:37.78]Somebody down here?
[351:39.28]Dog?
[351:43.34]More than one dog.
[351:44.07]Another dog?
[351:45.31]Dog three?
[351:46.79]Come on, dog three.
[351:47.71]What do you got?
[351:48.71]Dog four?
[351:59.15]Can I open this front door?
[352:00.19]No, I can't.
[352:07.54]Dog free for Rumble?
[352:10.06]Yup.
[352:11.46]You got it.
[352:26.20]Of course, it's just a monkey.
[352:29.94]Another monkey.
[352:30.88]Good thing I was in the middle of an animation.
[352:33.40]Dog?
[352:33.80]What are the animals?
[352:34.80]The animals are everywhere.
[352:35.68]I just healed back almost everything that was gone.
[352:45.87]Oh, jeez.
[352:47.73]That's not good.
[353:02.41]Permission?
[353:03.71]Ready to E for a time that allows one to recover posture even when attacking or taking damage.
[353:13.64]Okay.
[353:15.10]That sounds like a good item.
[353:18.11]I'll take it.
[353:32.29]Is this?
[353:32.57]Wait, is this the flower guy?
[353:33.73]I have a flower for him.
[353:45.77]One punch.
[353:46.99]That's a ton of posture damage.
[353:49.64]Fucking monkey bite.
[353:51.86]Give me a break.
[353:53.80]Oh my god.
[353:55.26]They don't let up at all.
[353:58.62]Like, this guy's...
[354:12.87]Oh my god!
[354:14.15]Fuck you, Aethas!
[354:27.87]I love the use of the monkeys in this game.
[354:32.03]They are kind of just everywhere.
[354:33.23]They're just... everywhere.
[354:44.65]Here's the other side of the bridge.
[354:45.83]Oh.
[354:48.71]Well, isn't that nice?
[354:50.69]Okay.
[354:51.16]That's... What... What am I... What do you... What do I do now?
[354:59.60]What?
[355:00.56]Oh.
[355:10.20]I don't... That's the dead end.
[355:12.08]Do I have to go back up?
[355:16.62]I'm not gonna fight those guys, are you kidding me?
[355:27.80]He's up here.
[355:28.42]Let me just hang out for a second, because now... What is that?
[355:45.11]They have homing fireworks.
[355:46.51]Alright, I can't.
[355:52.21]I gotta move.
[355:53.01]Dude.
[356:07.16]This place is kinda hell.
[356:12.55]I picked up an item and they spawned, like, four ghosts and now I- I- This is hell.
[356:17.11]This is actual hell.
[356:24.27]Ah.
[356:27.84]I don't even know where the fuck the game wants me to go at this point.
[356:30.28]Up here?
[356:30.68]I'm going up here.
[356:34.12]And... And we're going up there.
[356:35.70]I think... I think...
[356:43.33]Oh!
[356:52.42]OK.
[356:53.88]So let me up that.
[357:01.18]Can I go up here?
[357:09.89]Shit.
[357:16.15]No!
[357:16.99]Oh my god!
[357:18.07]Oh!
[357:20.77]No!
[357:21.63]No, no!
[357:22.55]Yeah, Sekiro, skip all enemies.
[357:26.13]I'm not dealing with you guys.
[357:27.83]Not now.
[357:36.59]There's no escape!
[357:39.23]There's no escape!
[357:46.79]Is there something else I can get here?
[357:53.16]At this point, I kind of just... You gotta just go.
[357:55.14]I gotta go.
[357:56.32]I just have to.
[357:57.08]I have to get out of here.
[358:06.57]There's too many people here.
[358:11.13]There are too many of you here.
[358:16.18]There's a... But that's... This guy's gonna see me.
[358:33.32]Maybe not.
[358:33.72]Oh my god, look for the door.
[358:38.82]Oh my god.
[358:51.12]Touch it!
[359:08.33]What is this?
[359:10.85]Oh no, what did I just do?
[359:11.97]I activated something.
[359:27.85]Am I teleported somewhere?
[360:09.58]It's Dunstan!
[360:30.12]A five pronged vellum made of aged bronze can be used repeatedly.
[360:33.90]When rung, monkeys and wolves alike are returned to their initial states.
[360:39.36]However, a monkey caught on the folding screen will not escape whether the bell is rung or not.
[360:48.15]Folding screen monkeys.
[360:51.49]Folding screen monkeys.
[361:10.93]Uh, where, where, what is it?
[361:36.42]Did, do I just have it?
[361:37.84]And I just have to ring the bell near things or something?
[361:43.15]Elusive Hall Bell.
[361:46.23]Okay, so then let me put it down here.
[361:52.62]Monkeys and wolves are like a return to their initial states.
[361:57.06]However, a monkey caught in the folding screen will not escape.
[362:03.79]Okay.
[362:04.91]I...
[362:12.28]Yet another who is lost in the halls of illusion.
[362:16.68]I believe you are on a mission and wish to leave this place.
[362:21.44]Yes.
[362:22.18]Then you must defeat the monkeys depicted on the panels at the whole entrance.
[362:28.23]Once you have done so, the divine child's voice will reach you.
[362:33.79]Uh...
[362:35.99]The monkey in the purple kimono is the seeing monkey.
[362:41.05]He has excellent eyesight.
[362:44.27]can see great distances and is very attentive if he spots you he will run immediately okay purple one runs and can see from a great distance with the orange one the orange kimono is the speaking monkey while he does not have particularly good eyesight or hearing he makes a big fuss when he sees a threat
[363:10.76]causing all the other monkeys to run.
[363:14.12]Oh, perhaps he merely enjoys toying with humans.
[363:18.14]So kill orange one first.
[363:20.01]The monkey in the green kimono is the hearing monkey.
[363:24.53]He has excellent hearing, can hear across great distances, and is very attentive.
[363:32.59]He will generally run away the moment he hears you coming.
[363:37.45]Making it hard is exceedingly difficult.
[363:41.57]I do not wish to leave.
[363:43.39]It is usually quiet here, which means it is near to Nirvana in its own way.
[363:51.26]At least, that is how it feels to me.
[363:54.44]Oh, yes.
[363:56.02]By the way, there was once someone who, like you, was on a mission.
[364:02.65]I believe he chased the monkeys for a while, but...
[364:07.34]uh okay okay there's the orange one orange and green
[364:36.58]Do I have to kill them, or do I need to just ring the bell near them? ...
[365:14.98]Uh, well, I'm gonna... Is he above me?
[365:26.36]Oh, there's a bell here.
[365:27.30]This is Reed.
[365:29.06]This bell is deafening.
[365:30.22]Ringing it recklessly will also make your ears ring.
[365:35.72]Which is the one that had bad hearing?
[365:37.19]What?
[365:56.26]Green... I need to like... Can I talk to him again?
[365:59.23]Green was... Purple is seeing.
[366:10.92]Okay, orange is speaking.
[366:15.50]Bad eyesight and hearing.
[366:18.30]So orange is seeing, green is hearing.
[366:20.73]So the green one you can fuck up with the audio.
[366:23.33]Alright, so green audio.
[366:24.51]What the hell does this mean?
[366:41.05]No one can hear anything else in here.
[366:45.49]So I'm gonna lure somebody in here.
[366:48.38]Lure the green one in here.
[366:49.42]I don't know how.
[366:58.46]Anything else to read?
[366:59.48]So there's the waterfall room, there's the bell, and then there's whatever this is.
[367:08.80]Bare flame in the wind.
[367:09.92]When it goes out, the place becomes dark.
[367:14.47]So the seeing monkey has to be killed in here.
[367:16.53]Let's see.
[367:30.12]So it's dark in here now.
[367:39.36]Orange is... What the hell does this say?
[367:53.36]The bottom cannot be seen.
[367:54.84]Above is darkness.
[367:55.76]Nothing can be seen.
[367:57.00]So the seeing monkey can get, like, pushed in here?
[368:26.95]Oh, there's the green one.
[368:27.87]Where does he go?
[368:40.10]Where's the bell?
[368:48.68]I can hear the monkey cha- like, running around.
[368:56.96]But that's still, I have to like ring the fucking bell, turn the place dark.
[369:04.48]Just talk to the monkeys.
[369:11.13]Uh...
[369:42.44]Thank you.
[370:19.58]No, I have both earbuds in now.
[370:20.94]I just... I don't understand what they want me to do here.
[370:36.85]I have to... I'm going to ring the bell and then try to chase the green one.
[370:57.06]What's the orange one?
[370:57.90]Is the orange the hearing one?
[370:59.13]Or the orange the seeing one?
[371:36.60]Come here!
[371:38.66]Get over here!
[371:45.02]Fuck you.
[371:45.58]Piece of shit.
[371:48.27]Fold that.
[372:11.74]Where are you?
[372:12.57]Come on.
[372:12.81]Oh, okay.
[372:26.97]Can I go down and around?
[372:40.80]No.
[373:01.50]No, I... I just heard him behind me.
[373:30.18]Ew, man.
[373:30.86]Come on.
[373:32.54]In the well?
[373:33.23]He's like under here.

[374:06.43]What?
[374:51.36]Damn it.
[374:52.88]He's not right here?
[375:03.53]They keep getting closer.
[375:04.53]Look it, he's right here!
[375:23.37]Where's that room?
[375:30.13]There's purple.
[375:36.56]There's purple.
[375:48.42]You're a dumbass.
[376:06.06]Okay, where's the last one?

[378:26.57]Terror!
[378:27.57]Terror!
[378:33.87]What the fuck?

[378:37.44]I- Why?
[378:43.66]Oh, there's a bunch of them now.
[378:44.90]What the hell?
[378:51.70]Why are they all here?
[378:56.10]Where's the green one?
[379:00.15]Oh, God.
[379:14.04]Wrong one.
[379:15.04]Wrong one.
[379:25.59]Where's this last... Where's the green monkey?
[379:41.37]You asshole.
[379:48.45]Why?
[379:49.53]Where is he?
[379:50.93]He was here before.
[380:03.11]I don't know where this other monkey is.
[380:07.93]Huh?
[380:11.01]Oh shit, man!
[380:13.67]Oh, there's too many of them!
[380:19.75]I don't know, I don't know.

[381:10.03]Found a green motherfucker right there.
[381:12.40]Green!
[381:15.36]Come here, you son of a bitch!
[381:24.99]No, no!
[381:34.48]Get over here!
[381:38.92]Get!
[381:41.29]Come here!
[381:48.57]Oh, he's already gone.
[381:49.41]Wait a minute, what if I do this?
[381:53.39]What the fuck was that?
[381:54.39]That's not where I was aiming.
[381:59.36]Oh, goddammit.
[382:02.56]Oh, goddammit!
[382:07.57]Can I go back to sword fighting?
[382:09.19]Remember the game about fighting with your sword?
[382:16.94]Not like chasing monkeys?
[382:23.94]Where the hell did he go?
[382:33.92]I don't know.
[382:34.58]I have no idea where he went.
[382:47.57]You piece of shit.
[383:22.78]I'm gonna ring- No, why?
[383:25.24]Why?
[383:26.16]I did- Ring the bell!
[383:28.22]Oh my fucking god.
[383:29.36]I don't know- Can I throw a fucking knife at him?
[383:57.25]Die!
[383:58.07]Motherfucker.
[384:25.09]Why can't I just fall from here?
[384:38.34]Knock bell, bell, bell, bell, bell, bell, bell.
[384:41.06]Do it.
[384:41.92]No.
[384:48.78]Where do you... Where?
[384:58.21]Where?
[384:58.87]What?
[384:59.31]I heard him go...
[385:18.64]Fucking eat shit.
[385:28.44]That was fun.
[385:51.45]Please, forgive them.
[385:57.82]They only sought to keep me hidden.
[386:05.40]However, it seems it was not meant to be.
[386:11.90]Close your eyes.
[386:16.46]Let us meet at the Inner Sanctum.
[386:38.11]He has a gamer neck.
[386:44.66]What are you talking about?
[386:45.98]He doesn't have a gamer neck.
[386:47.76]I accidentally killed the invisible monkey.
[386:53.34]They guarded the halls of illusions and befriended the divine child.
[387:06.56]Puppeteer.
[387:12.47]This technique temporarily forces one who should have fled this realm to remain.
[387:16.35]A puppet moves on behalf of its master.
[387:20.31]Interesting.
[387:20.85]Okay.
[387:25.42]What is that?
[387:27.40]Go to the halls of illusion.
[387:28.70]I don't think I want to do that again.
[387:47.92]okay you you're getting more and more weird as we go why do you seek this place I seek the mortal blade do you know of the blade that cannot be drawn yes it is so called for not one who has drawn it has ever survived yet you still wish to attempt this isn't this wait this is not the same person
[388:21.91]Nevermind.
[388:22.33]You gonna give me the sword?
[388:27.03]I got this at an auction.
[388:53.22]Six hundred and forty-five dollars.
[388:55.00]I looked at the sword and it killed me.
[389:25.73]Can't kill me.
[389:27.63]You have a Sans Eye!
[389:30.07]Ooh.
[389:30.19]New sword.
[389:52.71]Capable of slaying the undying, its crimson blade will take the life of any who dares draw it.
[389:57.45]Without the power of resurrection, one could not hope to wield this weapon, which allows one to defeat even infested beings.
[390:03.85]Long concealed within the... I'm going back and I'm going to kill the fucking... I'm going to go kill that fucking ape.
[390:11.08]Hopefully he's still there lying on the ground.
[390:14.90]I see you serve the divine heir of the dragon's heritage.
[390:19.30]Yes.
[390:20.10]Why do you seek the mortal blade?
[390:22.33]I wish to obtain the Dragontears from the Divine Realm to sever the ties of immortality.
[390:28.12]I see.
[390:28.72]I have read about this.
[390:31.32]I have read there is a way to sever the Dragon's heritage.
[390:37.03]Which means the divine air begrudges the power of the dragon's heritage.
[390:43.26]Go kill tutorial guy.
[390:45.12]That's so mean.
[390:45.90]I am one of the children of the rejuvenating waters.
[390:49.70]Created by those who would stop at nothing to achieve immortality.
[390:54.97]My false dragon's blood was created by man.
[390:59.53]I know of another one.
[391:11.53]I do not know if it is right to sever the ties of immortality, but the dragon's heritage undeniably corrupts the lives of men.
[391:20.58]And I share the heir's feelings about that truth.
[391:24.16]Shinobi of the Divine Heir, I have decided to assist you.
[391:28.44]Please, hold out your hand.
[391:30.35]What?
[391:30.89]Bless us with bountiful harvest.
[391:34.37]What do you got?
[391:35.15]Rice!
[391:37.05]Rice that spilled from the palms of the child of rejuvenation gradually recovers vitality for a time.
[391:43.63]Didn't that lady want rice?
[391:44.61]This is rice?
[391:50.47]There you are.
[391:51.61]Rice is a precious thing.
[391:53.69]It tastes better the more you eat it.
[391:56.04]And restores one's vigor.
[391:57.72]Hey, thanks.
[392:00.72]Shinobi of the Divine, you are welcome here.
[392:03.68]Have some more?
[392:05.64]I apologize, the rice is not yet ready.
[392:08.06]I shall give you more.
[392:09.74]Okay, well, I can get more rice.
[392:12.51]Only one piece of rice.
[392:17.05]Thanks for the one grain of rice.
[392:18.49]I hope we didn't need any of that stuff.
[392:28.98]Alright, I got everything I need.
[392:33.43]What about over here?
[392:40.06]I told you.
[392:41.62]I told you it was gonna be there.
[392:51.93]Okay.
[392:53.43]I think it's time to go up here.
[392:57.57]Does this open?
[393:05.38]It does.
[393:31.66]Ow.
[393:36.97]Okay, you're weird because you sit still and your centipede fights for you.
[393:51.95]Hmm.
[393:55.47]Oh, right!
[393:56.81]I can kill you permanently now.
[393:58.13]Alright, I gotta go kill the monkey.
[394:08.94]Hey, easy.
[394:18.43]Oh, you're hard to parry.
[394:20.54]You don't have a weapon, so you're just weird.
[394:21.84]You just slither around like a weirdo.
[394:31.34]Oh, that was fun.
[394:31.84]I'll see you later.
[394:33.70]I'll be back.
[394:40.72]Alright, where's the monkey?
[394:43.31]Is he still lying down in that spot?
[395:00.75]Down here?
[395:11.72]No, not this one.
[395:12.40]It's another one.
[395:18.50]Which one is it?
[395:24.95]Wedding cave?
[395:26.97]Wedding cave.
[395:27.47]Right here, right?
[395:27.99]Because...
[395:37.27]Wasn't this the monkey cave?
[395:43.79]No.
[395:46.29]It says Guardian 8.
[395:47.05]That's the one I just went to, isn't it?
[395:53.34]Oh, that's a... Whatever.
[395:54.78]Alright, here we go.
[396:07.23]Time for you to permanently die.
[396:23.38]What do I get for doing this?
[396:29.97]The wolf discovered this technique from behind the foe with a mortal blade.
[396:36.02]Extending its reach?
[396:37.62]Okay, so that's just... Cool.
[396:41.26]Let me see.
[396:48.07]Seven emblems to do it.
[396:57.97]Coats your blade with the blood of your target.
[397:03.02]Interesting.
[397:16.57]And what about the tutorial guy?
[397:32.88]I wonder what he's going to say.
[397:33.80]Sword on your back.
[397:34.92]What is it?
[397:37.51]The mortal blade.
[397:38.75]What?
[397:40.33]It's real?
[397:41.53]You don't suppose you could use it to end this curse of mine?
[397:46.82]Alright.
[397:47.00]Cool.
[398:17.17]So, is it time to do it?
[398:20.37]Should I just do it now?
[398:24.29]He's not ready yet.
[398:27.81]He needs to prepare.
[398:28.41]He needs to use the toilet, take a shower.
[398:37.42]Let's go to this.
[398:41.20]Screen monkeys!
[398:43.85]AP up.
[398:44.05]Now... Let's go talk to... What?
[399:13.57]The sculptor's idol is unavailable until it is communed with again.
[399:16.11]Let me commune with it again.
[399:23.47]Well, let me go over here first.
[399:38.83]Do I have enough to do my upgrade?
[399:40.22]I might.
[399:44.49]Well, okay, they're in here now.
[399:45.81]Didn't I get something new?
[399:48.85]No.
[399:49.61]I need two more gunpowder.
[400:09.51]Master Wolf, I've always enjoyed the sound of a Buddha being carved.
[400:14.92]So I stop by this place every now and then.
[400:22.36]Cool.
[400:22.60]Goodbye.
[400:36.40]So that means, do I have to go back?
[400:40.39]I can't even go back to the... That's... How did I even get here?
[400:45.65]What?
[400:45.99]Do I have to like go back through here?
[400:47.47]I have to commune with them again.
[401:20.88]I can go to this one.
[401:32.80]I didn't die to the screen, monkeys.
[401:37.67]What are you talking about?
[401:38.55]Where are you getting that info from?
[401:40.23]It took me a while.
[401:41.13]It was a pain in the ass.
[401:43.33]Where's the next shift?
[401:48.63]My watch ended a while ago, but no one's coming to take my place.
[402:05.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[402:06.52]No, I didn't even see you.
[402:08.74]I can still get it.
[402:26.08]Okay.
[402:27.20]Let's open this up.
[402:29.24]Can I not open that door?
[402:30.66]Interesting.
[402:31.30]Why?
[402:48.27]So you're telling me I gotta go all the way back up here?
[403:03.58]Whoa, this is a new enemy.
[403:04.48]Level 3, cool.
[403:35.50]You alright?
[403:42.34]In the moat?
[403:49.03]I guess we're going down to the moat.
[404:01.14]Are they actually in the mode?
[404:06.14]Swimming around?
[404:06.80]That's not a... That's a goldfish.
[404:10.49]That's not a shinobi.
[404:35.29]Okay, then back through here.
[404:44.10]I guess.
[404:58.58]Wait till they're fighting each other and then go in.
[405:07.54]There's this one.
[405:11.62]Why do they turn them off?
[405:18.73]That's weird.
[405:19.71]What's the point of them turning them off?
[405:50.29]That was a stab, right?
[406:05.23]Oh my god, I did not see you.
[406:06.95]Damn it, man.
[406:10.05]Where did it even come from?
[406:11.39]What?
[406:19.39]Oh, this is a fight angle.
[406:21.13]Three.
[406:22.63]Cool.
[406:23.25]No thanks.
[406:30.25]What the hell is this?
[406:33.17]Is there somebody behind this door?
[406:34.39]Oh god, is it... It doesn't open from this side.
[406:40.91]It's a...
[406:49.80]I'm so confused.
[406:50.59]Why is this whole area different?
[406:58.59]Uh, okay.
[407:00.07]This whole thing's different.
[407:02.27]Weird.
[407:22.53]God damn it!
[407:28.15]I'm soaking!
[407:31.25]God, give me a break!
[407:34.09]I didn't even know what direction that guy was facing.
[407:36.26]Ugh, I'm so annoyed.
[407:40.34]Like the hyper focus.
[407:43.28]It's hard to have any of your other senses work when you play this game.
[408:05.17]What happened to Gonzo?
[408:08.05]Uh, that's a good question.
[408:08.79]Are they- I feel like this- Are those- I'm- I have no words to even describe what the hell I'm trying to say.
[408:29.24]Fuck.
[408:30.86]Oh, god.
[408:44.02]Jesus Christ!
[408:47.68]That's just a thing that Batman does before Bane fucking breaks his back.
[408:51.12]It doesn't do anything.
[408:54.88]Oh, I just fucking dove into it.
[409:01.75]Gamer fatigue.
[409:02.57]It's time for a break.
[409:03.35]I'll see you tomorrow.
[409:18.72]My god.
[409:20.56]Play Picross?
[409:25.70]No, I'm going to bed.
[409:46.82]Playing Sekiro for 6 hours or 7 hours is like running 200 marathons.
[409:50.16]Why are there so many of these people out here?
[410:08.06]Maybe I can just- I think I can avoid them.
[410:17.10]Why would I even fight them?
[410:27.48]Oh no.
[410:30.52]This is... We're just back up here again.
[410:33.48]Didn't we do this already?
[410:37.60]I heard stories of your death.
[410:39.56]Yet, here you are.
[410:43.55]What are you plotting, Owl?
[410:47.83]Plotting, I would do no such thing.
[410:57.46]Isn't that dead?
[410:58.16]Now, my lord, I must ask that you accompany me.
[411:06.49]I was under the assumption that he was dead.
[411:07.87]This Earth has but one desire.
[411:15.34]To protect the divine heir from those that might take his esteemed blood.
[411:23.98]So, the dragon's heritage has seduced you too.
[411:30.42]Then there is nothing to discuss.
[411:32.98]Take your leave.
[411:39.65]I would, my lord.
[411:43.62]I'm so stunned by this view.
[411:46.68]I'd like to take it in just a while longer.
[411:50.44]I'll leave when I've had my fill.
[412:02.27]Uh... Okay, this is... a boss.
[412:08.61]I ain't doing this tonight.
[412:10.25]I can tell you something.
[412:11.05]I can tell you right now.
[412:12.72]Father, to think you were still alive.
[412:17.67]That was my design.
[412:19.31]But the same could be said for you.
[412:22.15]I was certain you died that night.
[412:24.85]The power of the Divine Heir brought me back.
[412:27.73]That's it.
[412:29.32]What?
[412:29.98]The Divine Heir's power.
[412:32.80]The dragon's blood must be mine.
[412:37.30]Father.
[412:38.20]Now you see it.
[412:39.80]Remember the first rule of the code.
[412:42.78]As your father, I order you to forsake your master.
[412:47.40]From this moment, he is your master no more.
[412:51.52]Forsake the divine heir.
[412:54.68]Listen to me, Wolf.
[412:56.62]Obey your father's command and forsake the divine heir.
[413:05.71]Obey the Iron Code, forsake Kuro, break the Iron Code, stay loyal to Kuro.
[413:20.93]Isn't the iron code to protect Kuro?
[413:23.75]I thought that was the whole point.
[413:40.90]So either dad or weird son.
[414:07.77]I don't know.
[414:08.47]Does this matter?
[414:09.13]I did say in the very beginning... I did say I was gonna stay loyal.
[414:28.68]I cannot do as you ask.
[414:30.46]You what?
[414:33.84]A shinobi showing the likes of compassion.
[414:40.59]I said it.
[414:41.19]That was one of the first options I got.
[414:43.15]I said I was going to be loyal.
[414:44.19]Miserable display.
[414:55.61]Why can't you understand your father's will?
[415:01.70]Have you forgotten the Shadobe code?
[415:08.58]A code must be determined by the individual.
[415:11.62]This is what I've decided.
[415:13.42]I'm so glad we got to come up here and fight in the boss zone.
[415:32.12]Dad, why would you do this?
[415:46.66]Why?
[415:58.27]And I can't wait for us to see this tomorrow!
[416:02.37]This is gonna be the fight of a lifetime tomorrow afternoon, I've got news for you!
[416:06.63]See you tomorrow!
[416:11.82]Just kidding, first try!
[416:27.22]Sensing some insubordination.
[416:36.10]What's that, a grenade?
[416:41.20]Smoke grenade.
[417:01.91]How about this, Dad?
[417:23.01]This seems like a really cool fight.
[417:26.85]My posture's terrible, dude.
[417:31.04]I can't wait for like a real attempted tomorrow.
[417:34.41]Between 3 and 4 p.m.
[417:35.65]Pacific time.
[417:44.49]He's not even trying.
[417:45.95]I'm just tired.
[417:55.43]So you really just got to run the fuck up there.
[417:58.10]One more try.
[417:58.76]One try.
[417:59.86]One try with actual healing potions and shit.
[418:01.80]Let's go.
[418:02.12]Is there a... Come on.
[418:10.30]There's got to be a quick way for me to get up here.
[418:12.37]There's got to be a fast way for me to do this.
[418:33.27]Where is there, like, an idol?
[418:34.51]Okay, doesn't anyone, like, run over here somewhere?
[418:47.12]Where is it?
[418:53.34]It's right there.
[418:53.90]Isn't there a window?
[419:12.75]Fucking miss it I thought what Oh God whoops Beautiful
[419:45.43]So now, can I get there from here?
[419:48.81]Oh!
[419:49.23]God dammit!
[419:49.93]Nah, I'll just get out there and run.
[419:55.18]So now I can go... Bingo!
[419:56.74]Is there a faster way to jump up?
[420:13.10]Alright, let's give it a try.
[420:14.62]I'll try it once.
[420:26.76]Why, boy?
[420:28.38]Why?
[420:29.12]Enough time.
[420:30.14]Let's go.
[420:30.44]Been a while since we did this, Spongebob.
[420:44.06]That does way too much posture damage.
[420:46.92]I'm gonna have to dodge that.
[421:06.17]No!
[421:06.92]That's actually a good opportunity for me to come in for an attack.
[421:25.76]Broken!
[421:26.84]Damn, I don't really have an opportunity to attack him.
[421:41.75]I'm trying to think of what's the best place... He's just super aggressive.
[421:47.13]Even when you parry like three or four times in a row.
[421:58.78]Damn.
[421:59.38]Fuck, man.
[422:00.42]Can I knock it?
[422:03.10]Alright, whatever.
[422:07.82]There's gotta be an opening somewhere.
[422:13.25]I think it's just dancing around until he does that move, and then getting the actual health damage on him.
[422:25.90]That's what I would say.
[422:28.15]If I were a video gamer.
[422:29.67]Well, he didn't swing.
[423:03.14]There we go.
[423:05.71]As long as Steady wins the race, just like the turtle.
[423:07.91]I thought they had the same idea.
[423:38.63]What's wrong with me?
[423:40.53]I have a status effect problem.
[423:44.21]What is this effect?
[423:54.58]Come on, Dad.
[424:09.90]Fuck, that was a mistake.
[424:12.03]Oh fuck, back it up.
[424:30.29]No!
[424:37.21]Do something else besides that.
[424:51.15]Alright, just one.
[424:53.37]What's phase two, Dad?
[424:58.32]Ow.
[424:58.76]What?
[425:00.50]Alright, that was cute.
[425:12.18]It was cute.
[425:17.88]Did you really just do the Rick Flare?
[425:27.61]What?
[425:30.95]What?
[425:35.63]Oh, he's right there.
[426:00.94]Watch out, get that out of here.
[426:02.10]Fuck that.
[426:08.44]Stay away from the right side.
[426:19.45]While I have a second... I gotta put this shit on the bar.
[426:28.03]I'm gonna put on the antidote.
[426:32.85]Just in case.
[426:36.65]And... Just in case of an emergency.
[426:58.65]Oh, damn.
[427:12.57]Don't let him get fucking behind you.
[427:14.64]He's gonna do something wacky.
[427:18.38]This is what I put it on the bar for.
[427:19.76]That's what I put it on the bar for, but I'm alright.
[427:41.51]Back it up.
[427:42.85]That hurts.
[427:59.32]No!
[428:00.55]You don't!
[428:28.11]Ain't got nothin' on me, Dad.
[428:55.32]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[428:56.38]Oh, it was posture heal.
[428:58.28]Dickhead.
[429:03.26]I gotcha!
[429:03.92]I gotcha!
[429:17.83]Getting close.
[429:34.38]Get in here.
[429:43.64]Wha ta tah tah cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha!
[429:51.00]Good, I don't fucking care, I'll kill ya. I'll take you down to 0 health.
[430:10.36]Oh, whoa, misdodge, misdodge.
[430:30.01]Fuck.
[430:47.66]No!
[431:08.17]Bye, Dad.
[431:10.27]Bye, Dad!
[431:13.78]I'm the real Shinobi!
[431:15.36]Unless you have a face for it.
[431:18.81]Which I hope you don't.
[431:34.00]Battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[431:40.56]Dad.
[431:51.97]Uh, Aromatic Branch.
[431:57.23]The Everblossom is a sac- oh, this is the Blossom, okay.
[432:07.75]That was a- I liked that fight a lot.
[432:11.36]Why is it both of- all the fights that took place on this platform are my favorite?
[432:18.10]I don't know why.
[432:24.47]This is the gamer platform, apparently.
[432:26.25]Oh, that was a cool fight.
[432:42.86]Let's use it.
[432:49.24]The great Shinobi Owl's unbridled ambition was to obtain the power of the dragon's heritage.
[432:53.32]Now is the time to let one's true name ring out across all of Japan.
[432:57.50]It was all for the sake of this ambition.
[433:01.34]And that's gonna call it tonight.
[433:08.32]Thank you for joining me on Sekiro.
[433:09.65]I'll see you tomorrow.
[433:11.59]We're gonna pick up right here.
[433:14.49]I bet y'all get real salty tomorrow, too.
[433:28.03]Oh, you will.
[433:28.67]Probably.
[433:35.98]I probably should, like, at least take a look in here.
[433:41.02]Now, I'm just gonna... This saves right here, right?
[433:46.24]Yeah.
[433:47.22]Yeah, it does.
[433:51.70]Kill tutorial guy?
[433:52.48]No, we'll start with that tomorrow.
[433:54.44]We'll kill tutorial guy tomorrow.
[433:57.01]First thing.
[433:57.59]Promise.
[434:06.66]Gonna have to redo him.
[434:07.92]Oh, that'll be bad.
[434:15.64]It won't hurt you.
[434:16.34]One look.
[434:19.92]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[434:21.12]Thanks for coming out.
[434:23.34]And I started to hit the gamer fatigue like a half an hour, 40 minutes ago.
[434:27.61]But you have to pull up your pants sometimes.
[434:32.35]I love and hate this game at the same time.
[434:36.95]I love this game more than I hate it.
[434:38.34]You know?
[434:48.71]Alright, the one, the guy down with the magic shit that you can't dodge and the terror and he teleports behind you.
[434:56.73]Oh boy, oh boy, I know.
[435:02.28]You love it and you hate it, what would you rate it? 8.7.
[435:16.63]mad because bad I was so mad I was furious that was reaching Mario tennis that guy just because I hated those mechanics that was almost Mario tennis that was like a seven
[435:39.87]And it wasn't even... I didn't even die that many times.
[435:42.11]I died like three or four times.
[435:43.41]I don't know something about that encounter.
[435:45.69]Is Mario... Mario Tennising me?
[435:58.08]But we'll pick up here tomorrow.
[436:05.94]What encounter?
[436:06.38]I'm talking about the headless...
[436:09.11]The headless magician guy that just stands in this weird tiny little area that you can't dodge.
[436:15.84]And you have to coat your sword in magic.
[436:18.56]And he's really slow and he can teleport behind you.
[436:26.93]That was close to about a 7 in anger for me.
[436:33.16]Anyways, let's get to the bits.
[436:35.43]Thanks, everybody, for sticking around.
[436:37.01]It was a shitload of money earlier, too.
[436:38.43]You guys are fucking spoiling me.
[436:48.87]But this game's really, really fun.
[436:51.60]It's... Essentially, you're at 100 the whole game.
[437:00.90]Let's go back to about seven hours ago.
[437:03.16]Let's get this on the screen that I can actually see.
[437:11.71]What was it?
[437:12.33]10 on the anger scale?
[437:13.01]I don't think I've ever been a 10 on the anger scale on stream.
[437:16.16]I think like six to seven is the highest I think I've ever been actually on camera.
[437:24.65]I don't think I've never been like a 9 or a 10 on stream.
[437:28.49]I feel like a 9 or a 10 on stream would be like me turning the stream off.
[437:32.83]Being so angry at something that I've gotten bleeding.
[437:39.63]That's probably what a 10 is.
[437:40.65]10 is.
[437:44.26]That's probably what a 10 is.
[437:56.97]Oh my goodness.
[437:59.29]Anyways, let's go through these.
[438:00.95]I know it's getting a little late, so... Thank you, Sad Vega, for the 250.
[438:06.37]I had something really witty to say here about Sekiro and your progress, but I forgot what it was.
[438:10.06]Hope you hit the temple up today, because that temple is crazy.
[438:17.74]I did hit the temple.
[438:19.94]It was glorious.
[438:24.67]Uh, Fitty, thanks for the $25 earlier, Fitty.
[438:26.28]Not sure if you're still here, but thank you.
[438:30.32]Dermot really missed the old Sekiro streams.
[438:32.06]Can you cough just once more for my nostalgia?
[438:40.23]Can I cough on stream for you?
[438:41.75]Thank you for the $25.
[438:43.55]Cats, or Quats, thanks for the $25.
[438:48.01]Right after that, $225 right in a row.
[438:48.97]I'm feeling pretty good.
[438:49.53]I still- it's lingering a little bit.
[438:51.21]It's not as bad as it was a couple days ago, no way.
[438:52.57]I really- Oh, that was bad.
[438:53.57]That was- old man.
[438:54.15]That was terrible.
[439:17.85]Thank you for the 25 bucks though, for real.
[439:19.39]Wait, why?
[439:21.01]Why would they delete every one of their videos?
[439:22.39]That's strange.
[439:50.10]What?
[439:52.80]They had, like, hundreds of thousands of videos, didn't they?
[439:55.18]That's insane.
[440:01.13]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[440:02.15]This really is the only good use of Poison Swamp in a From game.
[440:06.01]It's not just fat roll till you die a slow death because they give you all the movement mechanics to avoid it.
[440:10.66]Yeah.
[440:12.54]Once I realized that it was just sort of small...
[440:15.62]The Dark Souls 3 swamp area is so huge.
[440:19.36]It's just gigantic.
[440:23.18]You can actually jump out of the poison.
[440:24.58]I don't think I even got poisoned once in there, so really not a big deal.
[440:35.97]It was... Article 13?
[440:38.11]Didn't... Wait, no.
[440:39.65]Didn't Article 13 just get through, like, the first...
[440:43.97]part of the house or something.
[440:45.67]It has to get voted on a second time.
[440:47.15]Yeah, it passed, but it's not going into law yet.
[440:50.92]It doesn't have to go through one more.
[440:53.98]What channel?
[440:54.36]We're talking about Daily English TV.
[441:00.50]Yeah, it's not implemented yet.
[441:02.74]I think it has to go through another vote.
[441:04.82]Hopefully they fucking shut it down.
[441:11.48]Uh, Kazzy, thanks for the $25.
[441:12.88]Kazzy, pretend I said something nice.
[441:15.92]Well, thank you.
[441:17.00]You did, you gave me $25.
[441:17.74]That's an incredibly nice thing, so thank you.
[441:21.32]Honeychain, thanks for the $2.50.
[441:22.88]Jerma, can you pretend I wrote something funny in this message?
[441:25.02]Thanks.
[441:25.40]What?
[441:27.74]Uh, sure.
[441:31.08]That was fucking funny.
[441:33.98]But thank you for the $25.
[441:36.51]Oh, no, sorry, the $2.50.
[441:38.57]$25 was Kazzy, $2.50 was Honey Chain.
[441:40.11]You both had a similar message, that's why I kind of mixed you up.
[441:46.70]But thank you to Amish Robot for $5.
[441:48.96]Ass either tastes like soap or ass.
[441:53.43]That's a disgusting image that I can't get out of my head now that I'm going to have in there forever.
[441:58.51]What a revolting thing to think about right now.
[442:06.86]I'm gonna go brush my teeth three times.
[442:10.28]That's disgusting.
[442:13.10]That's not even... That's not even something I want to hear.
[442:18.98]Not after running 200 marathons.
[442:24.30]Thank you, though.
[442:25.48]Amish robot for the five dollars.
[442:27.44]Sometimes when you get in a boss fight that requires total focus, I don't really say very much, but... I do love the game.
[442:30.66]We'll see what letter grade it drops and raises tomorrow.
[442:32.14]Thank you, Frodeon.
[442:57.57]ProSef, ProStar, $25.
[442:59.27]Thank you so much.
[442:59.97]They say Army beat Navy.
[443:02.69]I don't know what you mean by that.
[443:06.92]But thank you for the $25, ProSef.
[443:12.54]You gave $50 earlier.
[443:16.24]Military money, let's go.
[443:17.16]ROTC.
[443:19.46]Doesn't the Army and the Navy do like a football game every year or two?
[443:22.99]They do like a thing every year.
[443:34.35]The unique commentary is me struggling to find a monkey.
[443:42.27]That really just throws you off though.
[443:44.09]Your timing hits and parrying and jumping around and fighting people and all of a sudden it's like, what about that like orange monkey?
[443:51.72]Go catch him.
[443:52.38]It's like the rabbit from Mario 64, but it's four of them and it's a boss.
[444:07.98]Hey, Pugatron, thanks for the ten bucks.
[444:10.80]Let's get him.
[444:12.24]Thank you, Pugatron.
[444:13.20]Was that really four hours ago?
[444:17.82]Damn.
[444:20.86]Thank you, Djack, for the five dollars.
[444:22.26]I take a professional accounting course, and today the lecturer booted up his PowerPoint, and the title was Sale at Undervalue.
[444:30.11]And I burst out laughing in a room full of business-type people because I thought it said Sans Undertale.
[444:36.42]I'm blaming you, so thanks.
[444:37.72]Nice first try on the double monkey, by the way.
[444:41.88]Why is that my fault?
[444:47.41]Sans Undertale.
[444:53.07]Thank you, Djack.
[444:54.95]Thank you, Void!
[444:58.01]Thank you, Void01, for the three bucks.
[445:00.67]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to ask your permission to make a TF2 item for the Scout based on your likeness.
[445:06.89]Asking especially because there's potential to earn royalties from it and I can add you on the submission if you'd like.
[445:12.93]You can hit me up on Twitter or here if needed.
[445:15.55]Keep doing you.
[445:16.07]The streams are great while working.
[445:19.84]Um... It really depends on what you're talking about.
[445:24.52]I mean, I don't really know exactly what you mean.
[445:27.66]But...
[445:29.90]If you, uh, send me a tweet, maybe, with what you took, with, like, maybe the design or something, or what it is.
[445:43.29]Because, I mean, that's, that's cool.
[445:48.15]A decal on the Scout's ass.
[445:49.91]What?
[445:57.80]A cosmetic based off dermis or a furry rat skin.
[446:01.66]They came pretty close during Halloween that year.
[446:04.94]The alien morph suit thing, whatever it was, could have been... It could be an animal.
[446:15.37]But thank you for the $3.
[446:17.59]And before anything else is said, good luck on the submission or good luck on the work on it anyways.
[446:25.86]Thank you for...
[446:28.38]Uh, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[446:29.98]Hi, Jerma, just wanted to say that I'm doing better than I was last time you streamed.
[446:33.40]Also, I'm taking a voice acting class with Chuck Huber, known as Android17 from DBZ, etc.
[446:41.21]That's pretty fucking cool.
[446:43.53]I'm pretty happy about that.
[446:45.23]I just want to overcome and get out of my comfort zone of being embarrassed by my voice, but 99% of people are too, so I have to keep that in mind.
[446:53.35]Anyways, hope you are doing well.
[446:54.63]Have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[446:58.11]You probably get a lot of knowledge from that.
[447:02.41]So, definitely, good luck.
[447:07.07]You should pull something great from that, uh... From that class, so... Thank you so much, PeacefulHaley.
[447:17.21]Good luck to you.
[447:18.35]Keep us updated.
[447:23.45]Thank you, Shadows1Discipline.
[447:29.56]For the I lost it here.
[447:32.28]Where was it?
[447:36.46]Um, where is it for the inger link here What is this I don't get it What is it is that from office
[447:59.13]Did I say something like this like a few hours ago?
[448:03.03]Hey Pugatron, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[448:04.49]Don't be angry, Jerma.
[448:06.99]I tried to eat it.
[448:08.48]I really did, but I wasted items and I was just so upset by it.
[448:15.78]I was so angry.
[448:18.66]Just seething at that guy with no head.
[448:22.66]It's a good thing I got out of there when I did.
[448:23.86]It's a good thing that I have to use items to fight that guy.
[448:26.62]Because if I had to stay there and fight that guy for, like, another two hours... What was the part when I said I was gonna throw my beer bottle behind me as hard as I could?
[448:34.83]Was that the... Was that that guy?
[448:38.47]Wait, no, that happened before, didn't it?
[448:42.03]What fight was that?
[448:45.99]Oh, that was the ape.
[448:47.27]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[448:48.27]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[448:52.85]So I did get kind of irritated today.
[448:54.51]But it's just the nature of the game.
[448:56.57]I really hope I don't come off as like an asshole.
[448:59.85]Or like an obnoxious dick.
[449:01.59]Because like I hate thinking that that's happening.
[449:06.37]Because there's like angry, there's like upset.
[449:08.93]And then you like start to crawl into like annoying.
[449:15.23]Where you're mad about something and you keep talking about how mad you are about something.
[449:19.33]You keep talking shit.
[449:20.66]And then you kind of trek into annoying.
[449:23.93]So, I hope I didn't trek that far.
[449:27.19]But this game is very... It'll do it to you.
[449:29.71]It will.
[449:37.87]It just has that effect.
[449:43.26]Apologize to Green Monkey.
[449:47.48]Hey...
[449:51.14]Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $10.
[449:52.14]There's more where that came from if you do a feed cam.
[449:54.76]I will never do a feed cam.
[449:56.01]That's not going to happen.
[449:58.35]Thank you for the $10, though.
[449:59.43]That's not ever going to happen.
[450:02.89]Internet Jorge, thanks for the $15.
[450:03.95]I've been stressed, but laughing with you kills all the stress.
[450:12.00]They say show love.
[450:13.92]Thank you, Internet Jorge.
[450:20.68]Thanks for the $15.
[450:21.08]It depends if you're actually critical of the game design.
[450:29.42]Trust no one's got a new video?
[450:30.83]Let me queue this up.
[450:35.75]I'll queue that up.
[450:36.41]We'll watch it right at the very end.
[450:40.03]Yeah, I don't like to be too critical of game design.
[450:43.07]Because I know that it rubs people just the wrong way.
[450:52.82]But in that little zone with the no dodging, I don't know if it's critical or if it's, uh, if it's just disappointment that I couldn't move.
[451:04.86]I don't know.
[451:06.30]Anger is a funny thing.
[451:08.72]Frustration is a funny thing.
[451:10.32]Because no matter what happens, you are always going to try to find a way to relieve your frustration.
[451:18.13]And sometimes that's just like talking shit.
[451:21.47]Just out loud.
[451:27.65]It's just salt.
[451:28.29]Yeah, salt just... It just happens.
[451:32.59]And like I said, there's a way to hopefully not cross that threshold of salt into... Alright, dude, relax.
[451:39.40]You're fucking irritating.
[451:42.80]I really hope I don't ever get there.
[451:45.12]And if I do, I'm sorry that I did.
[451:52.53]But it is that kind of game.
[451:56.31]X for salt.
[451:59.97]Uh, we also had... It's time for slime, thanks for the free bucks!
[452:05.76]Not sure if you saw this, but Vinny watched the clip of you playing Mad Dog McCree.
[452:09.96]Oh god.
[452:16.40]This is the best game ever made, I think.
[452:27.50]This actually might be the best game I've ever played.
[452:41.11]I can't even fucking do it.
[452:44.43]I can't do it.
[452:45.41]I can't.
[452:45.97]I don't have any balls.
[452:46.85]Try another.
[452:47.46]No, shoot.
[452:48.34]Try another.
[452:49.16]No, I have to do it again.
[452:51.24]I have to do it.
[452:53.82]Try another.
[452:54.92]Again.
[453:02.22]Okay, now someone needs to clip me doing this.
[453:05.88]Someone needs to clip me laughing over that and send it to another streamer.
[453:09.44]Hey, me!
[453:09.88]He sent it to me!
[453:11.72]I'm that streamer!
[453:12.50]Alright, now somebody's gonna clip that and then send that to my grandmother!
[453:19.51]No.
[453:26.22]Uh, that's fucking funny.
[453:29.40]Let's link it so you guys can watch it if you want.
[453:39.91]But thank you, it's time for slime.
[453:47.36]For the three bucks.
[453:48.58]And the clip.
[453:49.84]Pro set, pro start, thanks for the $15.
[453:50.90]I got the horses in the back.
[453:54.70]Hmm.
[453:56.68]What does that mean?
[453:57.30]Thanks for the $15, though.
[454:01.68]Drosophilia, $25.
[454:03.43]Thank you so much.
[454:04.01]It's been a lot of 10, 20, 20, 10, 15, 15, 15, 50, 50, 50, 80, 80, 50, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.
[454:07.77]You guys are coming in with tons and tons of big donations.
[454:17.50]So, thank you.
[454:21.92]Drosophilia says, what a god of a gamer.
[454:23.32]$25.
[454:23.92]Thanks a lot, guys.
[454:32.58]Uh, yes is online, thanks for $5.
[454:34.86]Without spoiling anything, there's a boss fight on... I don't know if I'm gonna read this.
[454:43.13]I don't know if I'm gonna read this.
[454:45.65]I don't wanna know anything about boss fights.
[454:46.93]I'm just gonna stop at boss fight.
[454:49.33]I'm gonna- I just- I stopped at boss fight.
[454:54.54]But thank you for the $5.
[454:58.94]There's a boss fight.
[454:59.92]I know there's a boss fight now.
[455:01.30]Somewhere.
[455:09.23]But thank you YesesOnline, I appreciate it.
[455:10.61]I just try to stay away from pretty much as much as I can, unless I specifically ask for it.
[455:15.78]But thank you.
[455:18.30]Uh, thank you Tay!
[455:20.76]Thank you, uh, Tayon, oh my god, for the 250.
[455:23.79]I like your title today, it's cute.
[455:25.59]Have a good night.
[455:26.51]Remember not to watch any puking videos.
[455:33.18]It was fucking hilarious.
[455:34.56]PikaBanana, thanks for the $5.
[455:35.98]Great stream.
[455:36.50]Jeremy Hart, always love watching.
[455:37.52]Can't wait to watch the moment you beat Sekiro.
[455:41.98]I'm gonna try.
[455:42.44]I'm gonna try.
[455:43.92]I'm gonna come tomorrow.
[455:45.12]I'm gonna eat a bunch of... I'm gonna eat a huge breakfast tomorrow.
[455:49.54]And I'm fucking gonna lock in.
[455:53.16]I can't wait.
[455:56.06]I cannot wait.
[456:00.71]If I had energy, I would keep playing right now.
[456:04.14]But this game is pretty draining.
[456:06.42]So, after about seven to eight hours, it's time to call it.
[456:10.22]But I do want to keep playing.
[456:12.63]I'll just do it tomorrow.
[456:14.15]And then SomethingRotter, thanks for the 250.
[456:15.63]Nice job killing your dad.
[456:16.57]I always knew you were hard.
[456:22.83]Thank you, SomethingRotter.
[456:26.13]And before we run the credits, let's go ahead and put this video on screen.
[456:31.91]This is from TrustNoOne.
[456:36.93]Let's see the latest in the saga.
[456:41.81]Audio VR.
[456:54.73]Today we're gonna play some fun VR games.
[457:00.00]Alright, are you going in?
[457:03.96]What?
[457:11.73]Wait.
[457:15.13]It's 1080, 50.
[457:15.49]Okay.
[457:15.79]Oh, I didn't put a checkpoint.
[457:23.36]God damn it.
[457:26.50]Wait, what?
[457:27.60]We're there, come on.
[457:30.68]Was I behind you?
[457:40.23]Fuck you!
[457:41.89]Fuck you!
[458:08.75]Okay, you know what this sounds like?
[458:12.05]This is what you would hear.
[458:13.03]This is the audio that would be pulled from a haunted house.
[458:18.47]These are all the noises that happen.
[458:20.60]You know how they funnel people into the haunted house?
[458:24.88]Like 50 people could be in a line going through and you can't clip all the audio from that haunted house.
[458:35.13]It's all on his house!
[459:01.80]Oh my god.
[459:03.67]There's probably a gnome at the end of this video.
[459:28.96]I'm staying here.
[459:30.04]For the end.
[459:32.26]For the recommended.
[459:37.57]Okay, police.
[459:38.21]Try playing without... What?
[459:42.87]Oh, that was fucking fantastic.
[459:43.99]Thank you.
[459:52.00]Oh my god, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[459:57.13]That was great.
[459:57.69]Thank you so much.
[459:58.63]Trust no one again.
[460:00.17]Until next time.
[460:01.01]Alright, let's run the credits.
[460:09.00]See you tomorrow, guys.
[460:10.22]For more Sekiro.
[460:20.47]I wanted to wait until the stream was winding down, but I'm working on a big unmonetized secret project about some of your old content.
[460:26.53]And if I could get your blessing before going through with it, how can I propose it to you?
[460:31.60]Um... That's fine.
[460:39.70]If anyone wants to make stuff like that, you know, I mean, the stream highlight channel is already there for, you know, stuff, new content, right?
[460:53.85]But I'm not gonna, like, flag your videos if you make a little highlight fun thing or something.
[461:00.79]You know, that's not... That's not something I'm gonna do.
[461:14.50]So you don't have to worry about that.
[461:20.16]I made a movie inspired by a rap movie.
[461:21.68]Is that okay?
[461:25.47]Yeah, that's fine.
[461:26.35]Don't worry about that.
[461:29.93]I mean, unless you, like, okay, if you, like, I've got an idea for a new series on NBC.
[461:37.57]It's called Jerma985 Stream Clips.
[461:42.28]And they greenlight you.
[461:44.34]And you just put Jerma985 Stream Clips up on, like, NBC at, like, 8 o'clock primetime or something.
[461:50.50]Then it would kind of be like, alright, um, that's me.
[462:02.52]Any chance of you going back to Hollow Knight?
[462:04.62]No, probably not.
[462:06.98]Probably not.
[462:07.44]I keep hearing the idea in my brain to go play it again, but I just don't think it's going to happen.
[462:18.43]I'm sorry.
[462:20.35]My scatterbrain ruins playthroughs.
[462:33.93]It does.
[462:36.85]Oh.
[462:38.43]Sekiro, Sekiro.
[462:43.11]After you beat Sekiro, what's the next stream?
[462:46.00]Gonna be going back to VR.
[462:48.68]Uh... Monster Rancher 4.
[462:50.82]Okay, here you go.
[462:52.52]Monster Rancher 4.
[462:54.26]And maybe Monster Rancher 2.
[462:56.44]I'm getting the itch to play those games again.
[462:59.20]Also, I do have Mr. Mosquito.
[463:03.38]That'll probably be another stream.
[463:05.24]At least for like an hour or two.
[463:08.82]On top of that, I have like another one or two PlayStation 2 games that might be fun.
[463:15.36]Mr. Mosquito is going to be... It's like an old one.
[463:19.04]Rare.
[463:22.53]But after Monster Rancher 4 2, Mr. Mosquito, I'm going to go back to VR again.
[463:27.15]Because there's so much stuff to do.
[463:35.15]But I feel like we should have a return to Monster Rancher.
[463:41.55]And with that, I will see you all tomorrow.
[463:46.83]Get some sleep.
[463:49.55]Take care, guys.
[463:51.30]See you real soon.
