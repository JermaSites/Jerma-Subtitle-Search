[00:01.89]I didn't realize this was still playing.
[00:03.27]One more time!
[00:12.50]Alright!
[00:15.72]Alright, I'll- Alright, it's off.
[00:22.32]I'm turning it off.
[00:24.20]Hold on.
[00:26.97]Oh?
[00:27.43]Mmm, they're set makers.
[00:30.45]I'm not doing it one more time.
[00:36.11]The next game we're going to play for an hour or two.
[00:38.77]Although, who knows?
[00:40.13]This might be one of the ones that I don't stop for a while.
[00:43.45]It's a classic, one of my favorite that I ever owned in my whole life.
[00:46.77]Again, favorite SNES games ever.
[00:51.33]Vegas Stakes.
[00:53.49]Those of you who know what that is, it's not Team Fortress, it's not a Super Nintendo.
[00:57.18]It's a casino game.
[00:58.52]That's right.
[01:02.07]This game, you gotta get to a million dollars!
[01:09.98]And if you don't get to a million dollars, then you lose.
[01:14.40]This game actually is very, very, very good.
[01:21.28]Let me change the title.
[01:24.52]Another casino game.
[01:27.19]It's, it's gonna, I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this.
[01:29.61]Random NPCs come up to you in this game, and they, like, try to take money from you and shit.
[01:34.21]You're getting, like, fights.
[01:35.89]Yeah, I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this.
[01:44.91]Casino Inc.
[01:45.57]Never Again?
[01:46.99]Well, I already did it.
[01:47.63]I already did Casino Inc.
[01:52.05]Let me get this right.
[02:14.47]What should I title it?
[02:15.23]Road to a million dollars?
[02:18.61]Road, I'm just gonna be road to a million.
[02:28.27]That works for me.
[02:30.45]Make it E. Why would I make it just E?
[02:33.19]Not gonna happen.
[02:36.08]Are you guys ready?
[02:44.56]Las Vegas.
[02:48.20]Vegas State.
[02:54.38]Vegas Adventure.
[03:03.99]When are we going to get there?
[03:05.13]I'm so tired of riding in this car.
[03:09.81]Oh, quit complaining.
[03:10.53]We'll be there soon enough.
[03:14.87]I'm not complaining, just anxious to get there.
[03:16.47]I don't know how to play poker, so I'm not gonna be doing that.
[03:23.76]Hope I don't lose my shirt like I did the last time I went to Las Vegas.
[03:41.87]We're here.
[03:42.33]Good luck and remember to go out in pairs.
[03:44.39]It'll be more fun.
[03:45.17]I don't know how to play poker.
[03:46.33]I really don't.
[03:46.75]Like, I know, like, the basics of poker, but I don't know how to, like, look at a guy and be like, ah, fuck you, I bluffed you, and then I lose $100,000.
[03:52.65]I don't know how to play.
[03:55.85]All I know about poker is you wear sunglasses, and just, like, you're like the guy sleeping in the back of class.
[04:02.04]That's how you be a good poker player, is just emulate every college student that's sitting in the back.
[04:09.55]That's... Elon Musk's... No... Go back!
[04:10.55]How do I delete characters?
[04:38.95]How do I delete this?
[04:43.68]Mr. How about Mr. Space space like a ton of spaces?
[04:46.72]Mr. Mr. L
[05:05.66]Well, yes, Mr. L. We certainly have your reservation.

[05:26.27]Who wants to go with me to the casino?
[05:27.73]Richard?
[05:28.03]How about Richard?
[05:31.44]Yeah.
[05:32.20]I have to call him?
[05:33.52]What, we're not staying in the same room?
[05:36.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:36.86]You guys didn't get a fucking suite?
[05:39.64]Separate rooms?
[05:40.08]What are you talking about?
[05:41.82]No, get like a, get like an executive suite.
[05:44.76]Everybody pull their money together and you get like fucking three bedrooms.
[05:50.17]Hello, Richard.
[05:50.81]How about going to the casino with me?
[05:52.45]Richard, wait for me in the lobby.
[05:54.69]I'll be right there.
[05:55.37]Alright, here we go.
[06:00.21]Select game.
[06:01.71]What do you think we should do first?
[06:02.69]How about slots?
[06:04.77]Yeah.
[06:07.82]All right, $50 level.
[06:08.86]How much money do I have?
[06:11.88]I have a thousand dollars.
[06:13.28]Okay.
[06:15.79]That's a $250 spin.
[06:17.83]I just got something.
[06:20.25]That's it?
[06:38.34]Give me another seven.
[06:42.16]Alright, I'm out.
[06:44.80]I'm out.
[06:45.02]Get me out.
[06:46.38]I'm out.
[06:46.80]How do I leave?
[06:47.22]I didn't want to play again.
[06:49.30]I wanted to know.
[06:49.96]No, I wanted to get out.
[06:52.68]I wanted to leave.
[06:53.20]How do you get out?
[06:55.38]No, stop putting money into the machine and leave!
[06:57.50]How can I help you?
[07:01.34]You got any advice?
[07:03.22]Thanks for the advice!
[07:03.94]What's that?
[07:33.05]Oops, all berries.
[07:34.13]Go on, another orange.
[07:38.73]That's fucking nothing.
[07:43.10]Stop, Jeremy.
[07:43.74]This is my college money.
[07:47.16]There it is.
[07:47.72]All right, that's got to be something big.
[07:50.74]600.
[07:51.04]All right, get me off.
[07:53.54]I'm done with this one.
[07:56.10]I lost $400.
[07:56.46]It's okay.
[08:01.32]Alright, let's go.
[08:02.04]We're gonna go.
[08:02.64]We're doing... Blackjack.
[08:04.94]I actually kind of know how to play craps a little bit.
[08:07.47]Not really that much, but I know a little bit.
[08:09.41]Max bet $250 for Blackjack.
[08:10.31]Alright, this time let's not be fucking idiots.
[08:17.87]Place your bet.
[08:19.23]Okay.
[08:21.09]I want to bet... $50. $50.
[08:27.83]We got 20 stay 13 20 No, I'm staying on a 20 why would you I'm not gonna hit I'm not that I don't care that's 20 This case stay on 20.
[08:46.79]Why would you I'm not hitting why would I hit with it?
[08:48.71]No, what are you crazy?
[08:51.19]You stand here, too
[08:57.94]Alright, $50.
[09:02.84]I've come to the realization the chat does not understand blackjack.
[09:06.76]People don't know how to play this game.
[09:08.80]But don't worry.
[09:10.76]This is actually how you play blackjack, and you'll get corrected if you ever play.
[09:14.84]This is basic strategy blackjack, that's what it's called.
[09:17.66]And if the dealer has a 4-5 or a 6... I'm talking to zoomers.
[09:23.48]Sorry.
[09:24.78]No, I'm not.
[09:28.03]Why'd you say that?
[09:28.65]I'm not talking to Zoomers.
[09:30.09]See, right?
[09:30.81]Just stand.
[09:31.59]Just take it.
[09:32.41]See, that's a 60-something percent chance that he's gonna lose.
[09:38.45]There's like probably 20 Zoomers in this chat.
[09:40.87]Maybe.
[09:41.59]The rest of you are fucking doctors and shit.
[09:43.19]You should know what I'm talking about.
[09:44.43]250.
[09:44.47]Let's go.
[09:44.85]Big one.
[09:45.35]That's horrible.
[09:48.00]Alright.
[09:48.28]Should I split the twos against the ten?
[09:51.06]What do you think?
[09:52.90]Split twos against the ten?
[09:54.40]That would be the worst thing ever.
[10:03.74]Okay, we're gonna hit.
[10:06.30]Give me 18.
[10:07.28]Alright, stay on- I have to- I should've hit on that one.
[10:14.32]Okay, that would've happened.
[10:16.04]21, give me a break.
[10:19.46]See, what I did right there is never do that.
[10:22.02]That was the dumbest thing ever.
[10:23.16]I was doing it for a stream joke and I ended up losing all my money.
[10:25.92]Big one, let's go.
[10:26.56]13 against a 5.
[10:30.90]Don't do anything.
[10:33.15]If you have a 12 or over, don't do anything.
[10:37.78]As you see, again, people don't get this.
[10:40.66]People don't understand.
[10:42.36]If the dealer's showing a 5 or a 6, especially a 6,
[10:46.23]If you have a 12 or more, do not do anything.
[10:49.47]Stand.
[10:50.15]Don't hit.
[10:50.96]Don't be like, well, I would've hit.
[10:51.98]And then you bust and you lose.
[10:53.26]No, you don't.
[10:55.62]No, no.
[10:56.40]That's how you play blackjack.
[11:00.92]Not if you card count.
[11:01.76]Well, that person's gonna get thrown out of the casino.
[11:03.26]Let's fucking split this.
[11:06.04]Wait, how much money do I have?
[11:12.93]How could I split this?
[11:13.93]I only had 250.
[11:14.39]It's just 50.
[11:15.57]Doesn't make any sense.
[11:18.87]Let's take a card here.
[11:21.12]Nope!
[11:29.64]So... I lost 250.
[11:33.25]You just did what you said not to do.
[11:36.61]No, a 4, 5, or a 6.
[11:40.42]Alright, I'm going to get it all back.
[11:42.08]Here it is.
[11:43.38]This is bad.
[11:48.18]I'm sure it's not as fucking dead as my dispatch list.
[11:51.04]Blackjack, right?
[11:53.93]Here we go, coming back.
[11:58.95]Just count cards.
[12:01.13]Now I know you guys don't play blackjack.
[12:03.76]You guys know that most decks have like eight decks?
[12:07.36]Between like six and eight decks is what people like to play.
[12:10.54]Good luck counting fucking like 500 cards.
[12:13.12]By the way, get routed.
[12:14.52]Kick that fucking person out of the casino.
[12:23.81]Had to do it.
[12:25.03]Alright, so, uh, where's the, uh, where's the ATM?
[12:34.46]Why did I hit against a 10?
[12:35.23]Yeah, that's a joke, okay.
[12:38.63]That's a funny joke.
[12:48.55]Uh, Jerba, we've been here for... 10 minutes, and you know we have the hotel booked for four days, right?
[12:58.60]Yeah, I'll just take a walk.
[12:59.88]I'll just take a walk every day.
[13:01.46]I gotta get that million, man.
[13:15.03]I think you actually, like, level up and shit.
[13:16.93]All right, just don't, no huge bets.
[13:18.99]All right, I need a new name here.
[13:32.70]Mr. Not Mr. L. This is, no, Mr. L is, Mr. Loss is more like it.
[13:40.05]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:46.57]Mr. Green is more like it.
[13:48.80]That's me.
[13:57.36]Greg Green.
[14:00.86]Mr. Greg Green.
[14:02.46]God.
[14:04.52]Let's see if anyone... Okay, Richard was a bad... Richard was bad luck.
[14:07.42]We're gonna bring, uh... Let's go with Maria.
[14:10.26]No.
[14:10.34]Isabelle.
[14:11.72]Yeah.
[14:21.19]Greg Green is the Greedy Grinner's alter ego.
[14:23.59]Put him in the lobby.
[14:27.63]Alright, here we go.
[14:31.90]Select game.
[14:32.74]We're gonna do... We're gonna go to roulette.
[14:37.80]Okay, no monster bets.
[14:39.58]Just play it well.
[14:40.84]What numbers?
[14:41.34]What am I choosing, guys?
[14:46.72]Alright, always double zero.
[14:49.91]Double zero, 100, no.
[14:51.15]$20 on double zero.
[14:53.23]And then we're gonna do, uh... We're gonna do, can I do like corner bets in this?
[15:02.02]And you kinda go right, okay.
[15:03.28]And then 13, 14, 16, 17.
[15:05.32]100 bucks on the line, let's go.
[15:10.99]How do I say yes, go?
[15:17.89]Now I say yes.
[15:25.91]Ready.
[15:26.99]Now I say yes.
[15:30.95]Okay.
[15:33.17]Mr. Green, have you finished your bet?
[15:34.27]Yes, I have.
[15:36.53]Let's go.
[15:44.31]Is that four?
[15:44.93]Four black?
[15:52.69]Anyway.
[15:53.25]Alright.
[15:53.83]It's alright.
[15:54.73]You go with the same strategy.
[15:57.99]Same strategy.
[15:58.64]Right here.
[15:59.32]13, 14, 16, 17.
[16:01.10]100 bucks.
[16:01.34]Get it on there.
[16:02.52]Double zero.
[16:03.50]Zero and double zero.
[16:04.50]20 bucks.
[16:06.90]On each one.
[16:08.06]Go for it.
[16:08.86]Let's move it.
[16:11.52]Screen.
[16:11.92]I'm ready.
[16:12.14]13, 14, 16, 17.
[16:12.44]Let's go.
[16:14.52]The corner somewhere.
[16:15.25]Right here.
[16:21.24]Just put one in every spot.
[16:29.90]Dude, just put like a dollar on every number.
[16:38.08]And then just sit there and stare while you don't win or lose anything.
[16:44.06]You just are annoying.
[16:50.31]If you did this at the casino, it would be like, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, stop, stop, stop.
[17:20.91]What?
[17:21.17]I just want to make sure I win!
[17:22.23]Alright.
[17:22.97]Uh, Mr. Green.
[17:23.73]Are you finished betting?
[17:28.49]Yep!
[17:28.89]I'm ready!
[17:30.11]String that wheel!
[17:54.98]Did I?
[17:56.08]What?
[17:56.74]Okay.
[17:57.74]I was gonna say, no way.
[18:02.82]You lost $20.
[18:10.19]Give me that all back.
[18:11.17]Thank you.
[18:12.57]Now, here's the real fucking play.
[18:14.69]Mr. Green knows how to play roulette.
[18:17.66]$40 on half the number.
[18:20.62]And there's a 50-50 chance for you to make it back.
[18:34.04]They don't call me Mr. Green for nothing.
[18:37.56]Spin it!
[18:47.98]Don't ever doubt Mr. Green.
[18:52.11]And then I do a full cigar in one drag.
[18:58.21]I won $720.
[19:02.97]How's your luck been, Mr. Green?
[19:04.11]Mine's been awful.
[19:04.93]Mind if I hang out with you for a while?
[19:06.25]Get out of here, you fucking loser!
[19:11.33]Well, that's okay.
[19:11.99]I think I'll just try someone else.
[19:15.15]Trying to copy the Green strategy.
[19:16.87]Not on... Not on my watch.
[19:19.81]There we go.
[19:20.35]At this point, I'm gonna go like this.
[19:22.53]Skip every number.
[19:23.57]Every other number.
[19:34.75]See, right now, there's like a group of like maybe ten people have congregated behind me.
[19:41.17]And, like... I mean, they might be taking pictures of me and shit.
[19:44.85]Like, this guy's a fucking psycho.
[19:47.26]You know what I mean?
[19:49.02]Alright.
[19:50.56]Hey, and Jess, good luck.
[19:55.22]Alright.
[19:57.22]Spin it!
[20:06.13]And the smoke comes out of my ears.
[20:07.39]Mr. Crane, you've won $640.
[20:10.01]Thank you.
[20:12.21]All right, now... Oh, I can't put it all on red.

[21:39.24]I sprained my ankle.
[21:40.28]I hate to ask, but Mr. Green, would you please take me to the emergency room?
[21:54.66]Who is this?
[21:55.22]Why?

[24:04.32]That sucks.
[24:04.90]I'm probably going to lose.
[24:08.14]Oh, that's even more annoying.
[24:11.14]That's even more annoying.
[24:12.58]That I probably have to take another card, but I can't.
[24:15.67]I can't have three.
[24:17.89]But I have to.
[24:21.29]If you've got three small cards like that, what the fuck, man?
[24:23.79]Eventually, I'm going to get a monster card.
[24:25.97]How's your luck been, Mr. Green?
[24:27.11]Mine's been awful.
[24:27.87]Mind if I hang out with you?
[24:32.76]You want to bet this game?
[24:33.90]Yes.
[24:57.59]Eleven.
[24:59.40]Ahhh!
[24:59.56]Versus ten?
[25:00.20]That's so stupid.
[25:02.34]This is dumb.
[25:03.76]This would be like a gasp at the table if I double down right here.
[25:12.47]Jesus Christ.
[25:20.71]Well, I hope... I hope some of your luck rubbed off on me.
[25:26.52]See you later.
[25:30.68]Why is he a loser?
[25:32.02]I didn't call him a loser.
[25:33.46]The game's calling him a loser.
[25:34.38]Blackjack.
[25:34.70]No!
[25:34.76]Not 20, anyways.
[26:02.45]Mr. Green!
[26:04.33]Mr. Green!
[26:05.57]Your luck didn't rub off!
[26:07.05]I won $15,000 on that slot machine!
[26:10.66]I can't forget my lucky charm!
[26:12.30]I want you to have this $5,000!
[26:13.26]Holy shit!
[26:13.90]Wrong voice?

[27:08.89]Can I go?
[27:10.20]Well, I'm gonna return to the room.
[27:11.64]Just hang out in the room for a little bit.
[27:17.24]Go gambling with another friend, save your scores, and... Let's go with another friend.
[27:24.10]Get room service?
[27:25.40]Alright, Cliff, let's go.

[28:26.43]Like, bet, raise, call, check.
[28:28.65]I don't know what that stuff means.
[28:32.79]Um... What does call mean?
[28:37.88]This is an awful hand.
[28:41.06]Call means, like, I don't want to raise.
[28:44.86]Hold.
[28:50.17]It means call your mother.
[28:51.47]It means... Call means you put the same amount that they did.
[28:57.12]Oh wait, the Bugleberry's over there.
[28:58.80]He's using some of that money.
[29:06.36]Equal to current bet.
[29:07.47]Okay.
[29:07.99]Okay.
[29:11.68]Call, call, call, call, call.
[29:13.44]So what does check mean?
[29:21.88]No bet.

[30:27.64]Why did you guys make me fold?
[30:31.02]That was a chance.
[30:37.11]Is anybody gonna, they keep doing this?
[30:40.45]Get a straight, a straight, uh, yeah, of course.

[32:22.73]He probably has three jacks.
[32:29.54]Yeah, who knows?
[32:30.04]That guy could have a flush.
[32:32.58]No.
[32:33.40]I can't, like, just pretend.
[32:41.78]I mean, look.
[32:42.58]Look at how happy he is again.

[34:40.92]Alright.
[34:46.78]Call.
[34:49.42]Call.
[34:50.54]Can you just go around the table and just keep saying call, call, call, call until the cards come out?
[34:54.68]Holy shit.
[35:05.09]Yep.
[35:05.59]Good.
[35:07.69]My secret is to know when to hold them and when to fold them.

[35:12.22]I can't keep with- I can't keep up.
[35:14.02]No, you can't.

[69:00.85]That's probably 20 grand.
[69:10.72]Oh, it's not 20 grand.
[69:11.70]It's a lot, though.
[69:12.94]Alright, that's it.
[69:17.54]Far.
[69:24.82]Now stop.
[69:25.32]Not yet.

[69:40.15]Okay, now we make it.
[69:41.65]We're going to make a new ceiling.

[70:06.74]Okay.
[70:07.98]Same plan.
[70:10.02]I'm going to stop right now.
[70:10.96]This is not real.
[70:11.70]This is not my money.
[70:12.42]This is not real money.
[70:13.86]Under 17, we're up.
[70:20.35]I wonder who it was.
[70:22.03]He's fucked up.
[70:22.63]Alright, this is it.
[70:25.13]I got one more after this, potentially.
[70:31.21]Okay.
[70:35.84]If I don't hit, we're up.
[70:36.90]Because we're under 17-5.
[70:37.84]See?

[71:15.77]I'm not... Are you kidding me?
[71:18.27]You want me to bring...
[71:20.61]$17,000 into a casino that's supposed to be like a bad casino?
[71:29.87]Oh, this looks really, really bad.
[71:31.02]This is pretty shady.
[71:32.08]We shouldn't go here.
[71:32.86]Oh, no, no, no.
[71:34.02]Excuse me.
[71:35.24]Don't worry.
[71:35.68]Let me just take $17,000 in cash with me here.
[71:39.50]I'm Mr. Greens.
[71:48.21]It's only $17,000.
[71:51.50]Alright, let's go to... I don't want to go there if there's so much money.
[71:55.50]We gotta go to the big casino.
[71:59.34]I can't go to Laurel Palace yet.
[72:01.46]2020 is the one that is big bets.
[72:04.43]I'm ready.
[72:14.61]Here we go.
[72:15.07]2020, baby.
[72:21.12]Alright.
[72:22.33]Here we go.
[72:26.65]Back to blackjack.
[72:28.27]Thousand dollars a hand.
[72:29.21]Let's go.
[72:31.93]Let's go.
[72:32.25]I'm fucking- I'm bringing this down to ten.
[72:34.07]I got a $7,500 bankroll.
[72:44.02]Shit.
[72:44.40]Bad start.
[72:45.16]That's a bad start.
[72:46.92]Fuck you.
[72:56.98]Mr. Greens, I found this wallet with a thousand dollars in it.
[73:01.12]You fucking idiot.
[73:02.02]That's just the money I put on the table.
[73:03.82]I was about to place it and I dropped it.
[73:05.38]What are you, dumb?
[73:06.54]I'm sorry.
[73:07.02]I don't mean that.
[73:08.90]Uh, turn it in.
[73:09.90]It's a thousand dollars.
[73:10.66]It means fuck.
[73:11.14]That's nothing to Mr. Greens.
[73:13.82]Turn it in.
[73:18.59]I'm so glad you found it.
[73:19.43]That's mine.
[73:20.09]Stay.
[73:24.47]Wow, you found a wallet.
[73:25.57]I've been looking for that.
[73:26.53]Thanks.
[73:31.45]Double the bet.
[73:32.09]You can't double... Why would you do that?
[73:35.92]Mr. Greens, the hotel office said you turned in my wallet.
[73:38.48]Thanks.
[73:39.38]I played roulette and put all the money on my favorite number and won.
[73:43.86]I would like to reward your honesty.
[73:46.22]If you weren't so honest, I wouldn't have won.
[73:48.35]So I'm giving you half of my winnings.
[73:51.93]Wait.
[73:54.41]That's just my money.
[73:54.95]You gave me $17,500?
[73:55.95]I had $17,500.
[74:03.59]Oh my god.
[74:04.97]Okay, I got $34,000.
[74:05.59]That's a 20.
[74:14.42]Versus 6.
[74:16.32]Why can't I split them?
[74:19.14]I wish I could split these.
[74:20.38]Why?
[74:20.72]Because it's not the same damn thing.
[74:22.60]Whatever.
[74:39.06]Come on.
[74:40.32]Look at how well I did.
[74:42.08]You know it's bad when you're playing a game, a casino game, and the amount of, you know, your net winnings so far are probably maybe like positive four or five hundred dollars at this point.
[74:55.55]But the amount of charitable donations to my bankroll has been upwards of fifty thousand dollars.
[75:02.27]That's kind of a strange casino game.
[75:09.76]My profit is just donations.
[75:14.97]Come on.
[75:16.13]Something vis- Why?
[75:17.47]Two aces.
[75:18.79]This is so dumb.
[75:24.45]Just like in real life.
[75:27.38]He's a streamer at heart.
[75:29.56]These are all bits.
[75:32.06]There's a blackjack, finally.
[75:35.12]Life imitates art.
[75:48.31]I got 30 grand.
[75:49.03]When do I un- Oh, why?
[75:51.21]When do I unlock the- the expensive casino?
[75:53.33]I have 35,000 dollars.
[75:54.93]Do I need to go- it's six figures?
[75:58.87]The only way that's gonna happen is if somebody loses another wallet.
[76:10.72]Fuck.
[76:16.13]That's so bad.
[76:20.97]the link link link link hold on wait wait wait I just clicked a stay holy fuck I didn't even mean to do that I can't believe that just happened I clicked the link click link hold on where's this link show it to me put it on screen

[77:58.93]You're gonna bust, fuck you.
[78:00.01]Check this out.
[78:07.12]4-5-6, man.
[78:13.36]Coward.
[78:15.06]Coward is not how you win in a casino game.
[78:18.38]I mean, that is how you win.
[78:22.46]What am I talking about?
[78:23.40]Yes.
[78:28.06]Even.
[78:30.88]Okay, sure.
[78:31.70]Could you put $20,000 on the table right now and hit blackjack and have like 80 grand in your pocket?
[78:38.00]Sure.
[78:40.24]Or you just don't win that hand and then all your money's gone.
[78:44.43]Rather than just bleeding $500 to $1,000 like I'm doing here over the course of like seven hours.
[78:53.23]I'm not doing this because that ends everything now.
[78:56.53]I'll do this.
[79:00.99]over the course of a few hours.
[79:03.87]And then look, you lost 30 grand, I only lost 100.
[79:05.59]Insurance?
[79:05.91]No.
[79:21.00]Turd Grand.
[79:22.97]It's just virtual.
[79:24.09]Look, are you kidding me?
[79:25.83]Do you really think the guy with no self-control, if I was able to, like, legally at this table, that I wouldn't do this three times?
[79:33.39]Are you kidding me?
[79:34.96]You know what channel you're on, right?
[79:36.80]There you go.
[79:42.14]There's a blackjack.
[79:42.84]Okay.
[79:47.72]I want to be able to bet $10,000 a hand.
[79:49.98]That's what you don't understand.
[79:51.32]That's double blackjack.
[79:58.28]All right.
[80:00.06]We've crossed.
[80:00.62]17 versus a 9.
[80:03.11]I hate this, but I'm going to do it.
[80:03.95]See you later.
[80:18.84]He could've just won so much.
[80:20.46]Yeah, but I- it's not allowed!
[80:22.18]The max bet is ten- is a thousand.
[80:24.84]I'm max betting right now.
[80:33.51]Go all in.
[80:35.25]I would if I could, you know I would.
[80:37.03]I would do a $35,499 bet now.
[80:45.92]See if I can break 40.
[80:46.48]Give me blackjack again.
[80:47.98]Alright.
[80:49.02]Let's split them up.
[80:50.54]Here we go.
[80:51.00]This is it.
[80:51.48]Split them.
[80:54.06]18 and 20.
[80:54.92]Stay on both of them.
[80:58.53]Stay on both.
[81:03.43]Get the hell out of here.
[81:04.25]Yup.
[81:05.07]That's a double.
[81:06.57]2,000 fucking bucks.
[81:10.73]Okay.
[81:11.37]Now...
[81:13.46]Mr. Greens, my little girl is very sick and needs an operation.
[81:17.06]We're too poor.
[81:17.80]I know we just met, but could you please lend me $100?
[81:27.28]Absolutely.
[81:28.84]Thank you so much.
[81:29.82]I'll come back in about two or three hands with $50,000.
[81:31.67]Bye!
[81:33.41]See you when you come back.
[81:39.71]Remember me.
[81:40.27]I know your face.
[81:59.05]Mr. Greens, you saved the life of my baby!
[82:01.15]Here's $200!
[82:01.35]Oh.
[82:01.43]Two hundred?
[82:02.19]I...
[82:15.75]Uh, not more than that.
[82:17.85]I mean, I had a guy sit next to me, and he sat behind me for a few hands and gave me five grand.
[82:26.04]And then a lady came up and asked me if I remembered what she looked like twice, and I got four grand.
[82:30.46]Okay.
[82:32.84]I saved your daughter's life, and I only got a hundred dollars?
[82:40.15]What is this?
[82:41.59]Are you fucking serious?
[82:51.71]And then just a huge, another huge inhale.
[82:55.07]And I'm holding it in.
[82:57.11]Where is it, where is it?
[82:58.05]Where's that, where's the smoke?
[82:58.95]He has to breathe the smoke out eventually.
[83:00.97]And then like a little trail of smoke is coming up from behind me.
[83:06.24]And then I just stare and I go, you know where that's coming from.
[83:09.00]And then everybody's like, what the, this guy's fucked.
[83:31.11]I can't wait till you get old, you think I'm gonna be like this?

[126:01.87]Uh, Mr. Green, this is a really tough hand to have.
[126:04.87]Uh, I would probably say that, I mean, 13 versus potential 13, it's very, very tricky.
[126:10.74]I would probably stay on this hand.
[126:12.62]It's very hard to, I'm not sure it's up to anybody's discretion.
[126:15.96]I would tell you to stand.
[126:16.92]Ava.
[126:26.65]I trust you.
[126:48.55]Steve!
[126:51.71]Yes, Mr. Green?
[126:52.21]Is that all you have on you?
[126:59.23]What do you mean, all I have on me?
[127:00.47]Is that all of the equipment you have?
[127:01.88]Just your shirt, your bag, and your... Yes.

[127:38.69]A fucking psycho?
[127:40.95]Steve, sit over here.

[127:44.67]What would you do here, Steve?

[137:27.40]That's going to be $1,000 a hand of blackjack.
[137:30.71]And maybe somebody will come by and give me free $5,000.
[137:33.43]And then I'm going to... I can't believe I had $400,000.
[137:36.09]Damn it.

[137:52.15]Deal it.
[137:52.41]18.
[137:52.45]He doesn't have a 10 under there.
[138:42.38]I could have saved the game.
[138:50.13]Sixty-six dollars.
[138:51.21]Nice job, Steve.
[139:00.26]I told you.
[139:01.86]That's enough for at least four or five monster meals from Taco Bell.
[139:09.59]That's like 50, that's like 25 Cheez-I-Go Dita Crunches.
[139:14.65]Well, I'll just sit in the hotel room and just eat five or six each.
[139:24.03]All right, that's it.
[139:26.51]We're gonna hang out for a little bit and do the bits and everything, but that was the sort of the length I thought it would be, about four hours.
[139:34.07]Sad end.
[139:37.98]so I will see you guys on uh what let's see on Monday see you guys on Monday we have a very very interesting week coming up Monday and obviously the later on the week the 14th the 15th and 16th are going to be very interesting

[140:09.96]Community Content Night will also be on the 14th.
[140:11.70]So we're going to do probably Monday.

[140:36.24]Take care of yourselves.

[140:47.63]Rook Rook on... I didn't say that.
[140:53.21]But I do appreciate the enthusiasm.
[140:55.97]Rook Rook.
[141:01.92]Thanks for hanging out.
[141:04.38]He's played Doki Doki on July 30th.
[141:06.47]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[141:08.11]I can't even give you a July 30th fake promise there.
[141:14.99]Let us rewind the clock.
[141:20.33]Heavy is Spy, thanks for the 300 bits.
[141:22.73]$3.
[141:23.69]Thank you, Heavy is Spy.
[141:26.52]No message.
[141:28.36]Wembley TTV, thanks to 250.
[141:30.12]Mr. Green is a real betting website in Europe, and it was founded in 2007.
[141:33.86]Sad to say someone stole your idea.
[141:38.62]Well, his name is... What was Greg Green?
[141:43.09]That's Mr. Greg Green.
[141:45.67]Sorry, excuse me, Mr. Greg Greens.
[141:47.89]He changed his name.
[141:50.33]It's Mr. Greg Greens.
[141:57.27]Yesterday's bits?
[141:57.93]Yeah, I know.
[141:59.33]I will.
[142:00.33]We're going to go through these really quickly because there's not a whole lot, so we'll be able to get through these easy.
[142:07.56]But Mr. Green is Mr. Greg Green.
[142:08.64]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[142:09.10]It's a lot of money just to give somebody.
[142:14.14]Thank you.
[142:27.72]It's a pretty brainless minigame collection, but the main feature of it is that you get to draw your own monster and you use that to compete.
[142:33.58]Even if you don't play it on stream, I think it'd be right up your alley.
[142:38.35]Damn.
[142:38.47]Hold on.
[142:58.27]What the fuck?
[143:00.83]This is fucked up.
[143:11.26]Hey, he didn't even have legs.
[143:12.24]He just slides around.
[143:13.60]What the fuck?
[143:22.51]But thank you.
[143:23.73]Appreciate it.
[143:24.45]And I will check it out.
[143:25.37]What's it called?
[143:25.73]Amazing Island?
[143:27.61]I feel like I've passed by that one at one point.
[143:30.67]Don't know when or why.
[143:34.21]Remember, that name is familiar.
[143:37.35]A bean dropped.
[143:38.17]Thanks for $5.
[143:38.89]My friend's birthday is coming up, who's a fan, and I'm making him a custom birthday card that plays the Rats birthday song.
[143:44.06]Is there any chance to get you to say his name, Nick?
[143:46.56]Like you say in the Michael Rats song, so I can edit it instead.
[143:48.88]Nick.
[143:50.14]Nicholas.
[143:52.14]Nicholas.
[143:59.87]There you go.
[144:02.43]Happy birthday to Nick.
[144:04.80]Happy birthday.
[144:06.66]Have a great one.
[144:10.00]Drizzy's the great.
[144:11.80]Thanks for the $5.
[144:12.90]Thanks for reminding me how annoying my customers are, Jeremy.
[144:15.62]Casino security guard here.
[144:19.49]I'm sorry.
[144:20.91]Sorry.
[144:25.03]Nick.
[144:27.25]Nick.
[144:30.07]I did it without sound, I got it.
[144:44.29]What?
[144:44.91]Uh, yeah, sorry to remind you of, uh, of the... the bullshit.
[144:50.37]Hey Will, thanks for 300 bits.
[144:52.06]Greetings, streamer.
[144:52.64]Why did you push the streams so that us European peons can't enjoy them in the evening?
[144:56.66]Please, Mr. Funko Pop Collector, please.
[145:01.29]I have to give you a hard truth here.
[145:02.57]This is a hard truth for all you people that are in Europe.
[145:05.55]I know you don't want to hear this.
[145:08.16]But... I live... I... Streaming between 2 and 4 p.m.
[145:18.25]My time is my time.
[145:21.37]And... We live across the world from each other.
[145:26.43]I live across the world from you.
[145:30.51]This is the time that I'm active and I'm awake and I'm the most alert and ready to go is around somewhere in the afternoon Pacific time.
[145:37.43]That's just the way it is.
[145:38.23]That's the way it always will be.
[145:39.29]It's the way it's always going to be.
[145:41.35]We live across the world from each other.
[145:45.48]He lives in an NA society.
[145:46.98]Yes.
[145:50.56]Just say it.
[145:51.20]Say you hate us.
[145:52.34]No, why do you want me to say it?
[145:53.28]What are you talking about?
[145:56.04]I live in America and I stream on American time.
[146:03.95]What do I want to say?
[146:11.30]Just move to the EU.
[146:12.80]I'm not... I don't want to move to the EU.
[146:16.06]Just say that you hate them.
[146:17.84]I'm not going to say that I hate anybody.
[146:20.81]Back up.
[146:21.85]You're getting too close to Mr. Green.
[146:29.19]What am I?
[146:29.59]10 hours behind?
[146:33.90]Something like that.
[146:35.60]Eight to ten hours behind, Europe.
[146:39.14]That means a long time.
[146:40.08]That's a huge amount of time.
[146:42.04]It's not like... It's not like I'm a few hours behind you.
[146:45.04]I'm like a whole day behind you.
[146:48.53]It's eight hours.
[146:57.25]You're asleep for fucking eight or nine hours.
[147:01.53]Yeah, at eight hours is a day.
[147:03.86]That's a day.
[147:06.68]You move on to the night time, you sleep, you wake up, you're not alert for those extra six to eight hours you're sleeping.
[147:20.41]But long story short,
[147:23.91]I can't... I've never been somebody that can have a bunch of energy in the morning.
[147:28.55]That's when I would have to stream.
[147:30.31]For me to... I would have to stream around 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning to be able to have it be like, what, 8 p.m.?
[147:38.76]7 p.m.
[147:39.54]EU time?
[147:42.12]I'm not at high energy.
[147:43.52]I'm not at high... It's not going to happen.
[147:45.32]I've never had it in my whole life.
[147:47.54]This is the time it's going to be.
[147:48.52]This is the time it always will be.
[147:51.66]That's pretty much it.
[147:56.64]Sometimes I'll stream before then because like maybe I'm just, I happen to want to do it.
[148:02.42]Sometimes I do it, but it's not the norm.
[148:04.10]It's not supposed to be, that's not normal.
[148:15.15]It's not normal.
[148:18.15]What do you mean?
[148:19.99]11 in the morning, Omega L lazy.
[148:26.13]Wait, so starting at 4 versus starting at 11 is lazy?
[148:33.39]It's just a different time of the day.
[148:37.28]Some people are morning people, some people are graveyard shift people.
[148:40.50]I'm one of those people.
[148:43.62]I'm at my absolute most active between like 3 p.m.
[148:47.68]and like 2 a.m.
[148:50.20]Some people are incredibly active in the morning, and that's just the type of personality, type of person that they are.
[148:54.87]We're all different people.
[148:59.70]Why don't you start when I want you to?
[149:01.49]I think you pretty much nailed it on the head there.
[149:08.37]This is fucking good.
[149:11.49]This is really good.
[149:14.43]Mr. Greens.
[149:16.64]But there's not enough sludge coming off him.
[149:20.62]It's pretty good.
[149:21.40]It's pretty good.
[149:23.84]Did you do this in one fucking sitting here in like the last three hours?
[149:34.12]Holy shit.
[149:35.69]That's awesome.
[149:43.93]But.
[149:44.82]I know that was a little long-winded, but I do get asked all the time.
[149:48.31]Jerma, pull your streams back.
[149:49.53]Jerma, start at 12.
[149:50.51]Jerma, start at 10.
[149:52.47]I'm going to stream when I want to stream.
[149:55.01]That's the way it is.
[149:55.59]That's the way it's always going to be.
[149:56.49]I'm sorry that we live across the world from each other.
[149:59.85]I don't have a time thing to make us closer.
[150:03.57]If I could, if I could press a button, I'd be at 4 o'clock everywhere at the same time.
[150:07.99]Maybe.
[150:08.95]Can't do that, though.
[150:19.37]I think this is a flat earth.
[150:20.63]Yeah, maybe if the earth was... No, that wouldn't make any sense.
[150:23.45]It would still work.
[150:24.13]No, wait, what?
[150:26.01]Would that work?
[150:30.07]Flat earth.
[150:33.35]Anyways, thank you, NeuroWolf, for the $5.
[150:35.61]Mr. Jeremy, do you remember me?
[150:36.69]You do?
[150:37.07]Thanks for being so nice.
[150:37.97]Here's five smackaroos.
[150:39.23]Hey, thanks.
[150:40.75]I appreciate that.
[150:42.13]Thanks for the $5, person that I remember.
[150:48.80]Does Diz thanks for the $5.
[150:50.40]Remember me, Mr. Greens?
[150:51.70]Yeah, of course I do.
[150:52.52]You gave me $5.
[150:56.65]Gnarly thanks for the $2.50.
[150:57.67]It's a shame Jerma lost so much money on gambling that he couldn't afford to hire the real Bugleberry and had to get a text-to-speech synthesizer that sounded like him.
[151:07.98]Jerma Pluto, maybe these bits will help you get back on your feet.
[151:12.98]Bugleberry's a real person.
[151:16.46]Thank you to Nut for the five dollars.
[151:18.12]Mr. Green, do you feel anything?
[151:20.85]My sides.
[151:21.95]That's the best character.
[151:24.85]I'm glad you think that.
[151:27.75]I don't think we'll ever see him again.
[151:29.91]I think that's the one and only time that Mr. Greens will ever show up, ever.
[151:33.59]I guess he has no more money.
[151:38.24]Hey, Anon Tins, thanks for the five dollars.
[151:42.96]Reaper, thanks for the 250.
[151:44.16]Remember, when it comes to blackjack, 17 is the magic number.
[151:47.72]Always hit if below 17 and stay when above it.
[151:53.96]It's not true.
[151:54.44]If the dealer is showing a 4, 5, or a 6 and you have a 12 or higher, the correct play, if you're playing basic strategy, is to do nothing.
[152:05.85]Especially versus a 5 and a 6.
[152:11.65]That is actual basic strategy.
[152:15.31]It's a term that's been used to bring the most returns over more than a dozen hands in blackjack.
[152:25.59]This guy just lost a shit... This guy lost a shitload of money.
[152:29.40]Why would you believe him?
[152:32.24]I didn't.
[152:32.78]It was Mr. Green.
[152:33.60]That's not me.
[152:35.08]It wasn't me.
[152:35.70]It was... It was Mr. Hyde!
[152:43.85]I am the casino, Steve.
[152:51.48]Steve!
[152:52.08]Steve, I turned myself into a casino!
[152:54.10]Steve!
[152:57.20]I love Steve!
[152:57.89]I'm a casino!
[152:58.83]That's fucking funny.
[153:10.99]You guys are fucking funny.
[153:12.11]I love it.
[153:13.71]Control X, thanks for the $2.50.
[153:15.35]I want Jerma hearts in chat now.
[153:19.45]I'm ending.
[153:22.35]Jershpee, thanks for the $5.00.
[153:23.73]Jerma, thank you so much for being a part of our Xbox Gamer Coalition for National Xbox Day.
[153:28.93]If you tell us three reasons why you're so proud to be an Xbox gamer, and none of this is real, this is fake, this is a joke, this is a bit, I'm not on that coalition.
[153:37.57]But I'll tell you anyways.
[153:46.94]They... They're very good at stopping doors after you open them.
[153:54.89]If you don't want the door to close hard behind you.
[153:58.85]Uh... What else?
[154:05.58]They... If somebody breaks into your house and they're brandishing a weapon, it could be used as a defense mechanism.
[154:13.14]Very heavy.
[154:16.12]Uh...
[154:19.98]Third one.
[154:23.28]Game pass?
[154:29.02]Do I get to stay on the coalition?
[154:40.55]Let's do a 360 and walk away.
[154:45.95]Thanks for the $5.
[154:46.49]Microsoft is a good company.
[154:48.99]They're going to come back real strong, I think, with this next console generation.
[154:53.91]I think so.
[154:55.03]Hey, Post, thanks for $5.
[154:56.47]Jeremy, I also recently started doing THC and CBD.
[154:58.90]Vapor Pen for my panic attacks.
[155:01.24]Talked about it last week at the recommendation of my doctor.
[155:04.12]It's so much more effective than taking a benzodiazepine orally.
[155:07.68]It takes 30 minutes to actually take effect when the panic is already over.
[155:11.80]Also, I'm not substituting your e-clown shenanigans for professional help.
[155:15.33]Like you said last time I donated.
[155:16.81]Fucking egomaniac.
[155:24.78]Alright.
[155:26.98]I have been doing small doses of CBD, THC combined.
[155:32.31]Three milligrams.
[155:33.03]I'm taking it because there's been studies and data at THC and CBD have an effect potentially on kind of shutting up the nerve response.
[155:46.72]If you have potential nerve damage or nerve pain.
[155:52.36]So I'm giving it a try to see if it kind of calms it down.
[155:55.56]See what happens.
[155:58.79]Small dose.
[156:01.27]Not a very, what's the term?
[156:03.59]It's not very psychoactive.
[156:05.14]Let's put it that way.
[156:07.18]With like a 1 to 3 milligram dose.
[156:14.48]Smokewise Ganja.
[156:19.65]He's fucking stoned.
[156:25.53]Just click it already.
[156:26.61]Will you guys relax?
[156:29.36]Oh, wow.
[156:30.24]Yeah, there he is.
[156:32.88]This is what you guys have been spamming me the last three gosh darn minutes.
[156:40.59]It's pretty good, actually.
[156:46.70]Alright, we are at the end.
[156:48.90]We have two more, three more from today.
[156:54.62]Stream be on.
[156:55.90]Thanks for the $5.
[156:57.30]Jerma, I wanted to say thanks for the streams and also when I posted a jupe the other day, you called it a pleb jupe.
[157:03.39]My reputation has never recovered and my girlfriend won't return my calls.
[157:06.91]I need you to repeal this statement at once, please.
[157:09.85]A four year long relationship gone because I forgot to renew my sub.
[157:14.15]If you don't, what I'm forced to do,
[157:17.98]Bela Lugosi is... Is this a Bela Lugosi died thing?
[157:23.88]Oh, anyways.
[157:24.38]No, it still stands.
[157:25.64]Come on.
[157:32.29]Pleb Jupe.
[157:35.81]I don't even know what that means.
[157:38.89]What is a pleb Jupiter?
[157:41.52]Is that just a regular Jupiter just connected with all sides?
[157:44.38]What's a pleb Jupe?
[157:45.54]What is it?
[157:47.57]Show it to me.
[157:50.85]It's just a regular one.
[157:52.53]No weird, crazy other stuff in the middle.
[157:57.80]Oh, it's somebody doing it that's not subbed.
[158:00.74]Okay.
[158:01.38]There it is.
[158:02.02]I see it.
[158:03.44]That's a pleb juke.
[158:04.56]Okay, I get it.
[158:06.28]Now I know my terms.
[158:09.34]For my own community.
[158:13.51]Anyways.
[158:14.73]Thank you.
[158:16.11]And yeah, fine, it's been repealed.
[158:17.59]Hey, Mr. Jazzles, thanks for the $5.
[158:19.43]Germa, I was more interested... I was more invested in Mr. Green and Steve than I was in Resident Evil 3.
[158:25.26]Also, did you not realize that Bugleberry was a robot the whole time?
[158:28.50]Nope, I had no idea.
[158:30.02]No, you just said it.
[158:33.42]Hey, Mikasa, thanks for the $3.
[158:34.62]Hi, Mr. Germa, I've been trying to reach you concerning your vehicle's extended warranty.
[158:39.33]Okay.
[158:40.99]You should have received a notice in the mail about your car's extended warranty eligibility.
[158:44.31]We haven't gotten a response.
[158:45.41]We're going to give you a final courtesy call before we close out your file.
[158:48.51]Press 2 to be removed and placed on a do not call list.
[158:51.69]Speak to someone about possibly extending and reinstating your vehicle's warranty.
[158:54.35]Press 1 for a warranty specialist.
[159:03.45]Fuck.
[159:08.57]Am I still connected?
[159:10.87]Rest one.
[159:12.97]Hey, Post, thanks for the 500 bits baked streamer.
[159:17.27]Oh, mega lul.
[159:19.55]Hey, X Whimsical Moose, thanks for 250.
[159:22.90]Jeremiah, I love this train wreck.
[159:24.68]I was wondering when the next Channel Points thing will happen.
[159:26.74]Also, RIP Bela Lugosi.
[159:31.42]The next Channel Points thing.
[159:32.62]That's a real good question.
[159:36.77]We might have that.
[159:37.35]We might talk about something like that soon.
[159:39.89]We'll see.
[159:41.67]We'll see.
[159:46.49]But, we're going to move on to yesterday.
[159:48.29]And I'm going to go through these bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[159:53.46]And then we'll catch the ones that came in now.
[159:56.96]Yeah.
[159:59.00]This is from yesterday.
[159:59.92]You ready for the lightning round?
[160:04.50]Hamrick, $5.
[160:05.60]Thanks a lot.
[160:06.32]For real dough, $2.50.
[160:09.15]I don't know what that is.
[160:12.13]I don't know what that is.
[160:13.91]I did think it was good.
[160:19.42]I did give it a 74 though.
[160:21.02]It's the amount of save files that were available.
[160:36.94]Clammy Bob, thanks for the $10.
[160:39.04]Read all the lore and make up voices for the dialogue.
[160:41.30]Nah, somebody else will do it.
[160:44.05]Adrian, thanks for the $3.
[160:48.31]Agent Dark Booty, thanks for the $50.
[160:50.11]Did I not catch these?
[160:52.71]How?
[160:54.51]Don't listen to the haters.
[160:55.49]This game is fun, just not as good as Resident Evil 2.
[160:58.04]I think I caught these.
[161:00.96]There was a fart there.
[161:02.38]No, there was not.
[161:10.26]Was I one of the haters at the end of last night's stream?
[161:12.38]74 is not a hater.
[161:15.80]Like 62 is a hater, I think.
[161:18.10]Like 58 is a hater.
[161:21.32]74 is... I'm not a hater.
[161:25.36]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250.
[161:28.35]Grandma, love you, big fella.
[161:29.61]Why don't you have a Channel Points icon?
[161:31.21]Shouldn't it be like a bald coin?
[161:33.45]Channel Points will come back soon.
[161:36.09]Agent, Dark Booty, thanks for the $5.

[162:27.61]Hello again, Germ.
[162:28.47]So I had it right.

[162:57.72]I kept it on there, right?
[162:59.36]I capped it, right?
[163:00.00]That is fucking silly.

[163:05.54]That thing's a beast, isn't it?
[163:11.96]Should I get a 2080?
[163:14.25]Are they cheap?
[163:15.79]They've been up for like a year, right?
[163:16.89]That means that they drop by like 80% in value after like three days.
[163:20.43]How much is it worth?
[163:26.11]Just wait for next gen, okay.
[163:30.41]Aren't graphics cards like used cars or something?
[163:32.65]You drive off the lot and it drops like 20%.
[163:37.84]But thanks for the tip tag.
[163:39.78]Good to hear from you.
[163:40.24]Good to see you.
[163:40.68]Thanks for the $15.

[163:50.50]Thanks for making quarantine a lot more fun.
[163:53.18]Sorry to hear that.
[163:56.32]I'm more than happy to hang out with everybody here.
[164:01.64]We're all dealing with this shit.
[164:04.32]It's all something that we all have to fucking just ride out and see what happens and hope it goes away.
[164:09.72]And hope there can be medicine and hope there can be shit that can be taken care of and people go back to work and can be brought back to work.
[164:14.87]I mean, you see the numbers.
[164:17.43]It's fucking, it's terrible.
[164:19.69]I really hope we can get back to some kind of normalcy.
[164:24.86]If you're affected by it, I'm really sorry to hear that.
[164:27.38]I really am.
[164:28.36]Because that's fucked up.
[164:29.48]You didn't do anything wrong.
[164:31.58]That's the worst thing about all this.
[164:33.76]If you're dropped from a company because of this, that's just fucking horrible.
[164:38.86]Because you didn't do anything wrong.
[164:44.90]Thank you.
[164:50.16]An anonymous cheerer gave $10.
[164:51.28]No message, just $10. $10.
[164:56.27]Thank you, whoever you are.
[164:56.99]Uh, MrFishPudding gave 300 bits.
[165:00.24]Jerma, it's my brother's bir- A lot of birthdays!
[165:02.06]You guys have a ton of birthdays.
[165:03.18]It's your brother's birthday on Friday.
[165:08.44]I think he's already expecting me to play the birthday rat song for him.
[165:11.08]I was wondering if you could say his name so I could edit it in.
[165:13.76]I think- Wait, hold on.
[165:17.29]His name is Griffin.
[165:22.93]Is this the same person?
[165:38.55]I wanna edit, it's like, hold on.
[165:40.19]His name, thanks, and thank you for all you do.
[165:42.21]Oh, this is freaking, this is weird.
[165:46.01]The other person was Nick.
[165:54.79]Compare the messages.
[165:58.33]Hold on.
[166:03.53]That's like very weirdly, it's like worded, right?
[166:06.21]A lot of birthdays.
[166:07.53]If it's the same person, is it different?
[166:10.51]Hold on, where is it?
[166:17.43]Where's this message?
[166:21.25]Why is it gone?
[166:25.81]Oh, here we go.
[166:28.57]It's my brother's birthday on Friday.
[166:29.83]My friend's birthday is coming up.
[166:30.81]He was a fan and I'm making him a custom birthday card.
[166:35.37]He's expecting me to play Rad's birthday, but I was wondering, can you say his name so I can edit it in?
[166:39.83]Please, Rad's birthday song.
[166:40.57]Is there any chance I can get you to say his name like you Michael in the song so I can edit it in?
[166:44.13]Thank you.
[166:49.63]No, this arrived after this.
[166:51.70]This is interesting.
[166:52.86]This is crazy.
[166:55.78]Well, Griffin, happy birthday.
[166:57.66]Okay.
[167:02.21]If this is two different people, then you guys got the same great idea.
[167:08.26]Happy birthday to Griffin.
[167:11.66]Peter Griffin.
[167:21.61]Somebody said that and I read it.
[167:22.77]Alright.

[168:03.50]What the fuck?
[168:31.89]I'm trying to get this image on the screen.
[168:35.04]Google Images sucks.
[168:36.82]It really is the worst.
[168:38.28]If you want to try to pull a photo from Google Images, good luck.
[168:42.06]You get redirected five times.
[168:48.71]I just want to get the image.

[168:51.17]Did it work?
[168:55.17]Let's find out.
[169:08.72]I want to show this on stream because it's fucking crazy.
[169:10.60]This actually looks very much like me.
[169:16.92]Here we go.
[169:17.34]Hurry up.
[169:27.78]I just tried.
[169:28.26]I had to save it like three times.

[169:42.33]Thanks for the... Thanks for the $3, Dragon Pixies.

[170:03.40]This is the guy... It was a guy that... Okay.
[170:07.08]All right.
[170:09.16]They say, sending my suicide note to Jerma only for him to be on CBD and skip the lore.
[170:15.89]Then speed read it.
[170:16.93]It's talking about Resident Evil 3.
[170:18.27]Talking about Resident Evil 3.
[170:20.27]The guy that I just, I didn't read this note.
[170:23.09]That's what he was, okay.
[170:24.65]Alright, for a second I was like, what the fuck is this?
[170:28.57]The guy that was sitting on the ground and I didn't read it.
[170:31.10]Okay, yeah.
[170:31.50]I get it.
[170:38.50]I got, you're kind of freaking me out.
[170:40.22]I got freaked out for a second.
[170:41.32]I was like, what's going on?
[170:43.01]What did I do?
[170:44.43]What happened?
[170:49.43]Thanks for the $2.50, though.
[170:52.31]Hey, IluSSB, thanks for the thousand bits.
[170:57.84]A friend of mine showed me your 700,000 games video last year, and I've been a big fan ever since.
[171:02.46]Thank you for making me laugh, and I hope you're doing well in these tough times.
[171:05.10]Thank you.
[171:06.53]Hey, I don't know if you don't know.
[171:09.31]I did a 700,000 game stream part 2 edition.
[171:13.47]I did that last year.
[171:15.91]Some things that may not have shown up in that video showed up on that live stream.
[171:20.91]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[171:24.76]Don't promo yourself.
[171:26.64]It's my own damn stream.
[171:27.82]What do you mean?
[171:31.42]If I served you food that I cooked, what am I going to say?
[171:34.82]Here's a steak I made.
[171:36.44]It's probably disgusting.
[171:37.48]Don't eat it.
[171:38.06]Ew.
[171:39.54]My steaks are terrible.
[171:40.84]All my food is bad.
[171:42.06]Eat up.
[171:43.62]No, you're going to be like, I got the best rub on it.
[171:46.84]You're going to love it.
[171:47.76]Cook perfectly to your loving.
[171:49.28]To you how you like it.
[171:51.13]How would I do that?
[171:51.85]No.
[171:55.92]I do throw grenades in these games and I do very well.
[171:59.50]I'm trying to.
[172:01.14]And while we're on the topic of Victorian things, it's probably time you pay a little respect to your ancestors.
[172:27.15]I don't understand.
[172:29.07]That's not me.
[172:34.07]Where is it?
[172:35.39]Okay, this is like an old-timey clown or something?
[172:39.45]What is it?
[172:39.73]Is this your real ancestor?
[172:51.05]It's you.
[172:51.59]It's him.
[172:54.71]A one-man band.
[172:55.93]A one-man clown.
[173:03.95]They're all- What?
[173:06.78]Hey, Showerbeer, thanks for $3.
[173:08.72]Germa, you should host the Tonight Show.
[173:10.68]Fog Jam.
[173:13.26]Hey, ZeroGiblets, thanks for the $5.
[173:15.20]Hi, Germa.
[173:15.88]I want to thank you for all you do.
[173:17.82]I hope you and Kim are staying well.
[173:19.78]Remember you once said that the only thing that prevents Bloodborne from being a perfect 10...
[173:24.74]The game ran at 30 FPS.
[173:26.34]It's a fair point.
[173:27.91]Check it out, though.
[173:28.53]Someone patched the game to run at 60.
[173:29.97]It's very nice to watch.
[173:32.14]I actually did see this.
[173:34.88]I did see this.
[173:37.92]there is a ps5 here we go if there is a ps5 sort of remastering of Bloodborne and they pump it up to 60 tweak a little bit of things maybe I'm not asking for it I'm just I am I'm asking for it maybe maybe like another maybe like a DLC it's all that's asking a lot
[174:02.81]But if there was like a PS5, like re-classic edition, re-just paint it over and bring it over to PS5 or even PC.
[174:11.58]Add a little bit of content, maybe a couple items.
[174:15.05]It would be a 10.
[174:15.41]Maybe they'll do that on July 30th, maybe.
[174:25.28]Tell the banana with the olive oil story One time I dipped a banana in olive oil thinking it was gonna taste good And it was just gross But it was gonna add like some saltiness to the sweetness and it was just didn't work out and I blew I spit it out And it was gross.
[174:42.10]I spit it into the trash yuck Hey goo berry juice, thanks for 250

[175:04.47]Hey, Jobbed Bone.
[175:05.67]Thanks for 250.
[175:07.60]What do I do if I forget my clothes in the washer for a week and a half?
[175:11.48]Easy.
[175:12.32]What you do is you just close the lid, put detergent in, and wash them again.
[175:18.36]And then change them over.
[175:23.53]Hey, Snoozencopter, thanks for the 250.
[175:24.69]Hey, it's me, Snoozencopter.

[175:33.65]I will now, though.
[175:34.49]Really?
[175:34.77]It's been long enough.
[175:36.15]Okay.

[175:58.43]This is what is happening.
[176:05.19]The fabled July 30th.
[176:06.15]It's happening on July 30th.
[176:06.95]Don't worry.
[176:09.13]You'll see it.
[176:09.59]Sooner than your birthday.

[176:14.47]Key of the dead thanks for the thousand bits and no message just Thousand bits and some emotes with a grave thing with a month zombie coming out of the grave Thanks for the thousand dollars.
[176:26.04]That's not how much that is Thanks for the thousand.
[176:30.09]Thanks for the ten dollars That's a nonchalantly saying thanks for the thousand dollars
[176:36.12]Thanks for the $10.
[176:37.38]$10 is still a really good amount of money to give anybody.
[176:41.39]But reading it like, thanks for $1,000.
[176:43.47]Fuck me.
[176:45.17]White Fox, thanks for the 300 bits.
[176:49.07]Jerma, would you please play Resistance Fall of Man?
[176:52.94]Sometimes.
[176:53.58]It was a launch title for the PlayStation 3 about an alternate history of World War II.
[176:57.56]The series kind of died out when the third game sucked.
[177:00.24]But 1 and 2 are amazing.
[177:01.78]Don't listen to the two haters.
[177:02.88]They're both great.
[177:05.83]I actually remember that game.
[177:08.19]I do remember it.
[177:16.74]I remember it was... The big selling point was... Look at how many enemies we can put on the screen, right?
[177:23.28]Isn't that a big thing about it?
[177:25.44]We can handle like 50 enemies on screen at the same time.
[177:29.12]It was a big deal.
[177:32.38]That's cool.
[177:36.29]The online was terrible.
[177:40.58]Yeah, I forget that PS3 and Xbox 360, they had a, online was huge on the 360 and PS3.
[177:48.67]Sometimes I forget it existed.
[177:49.91]You know, doesn't it feel like Wi-Fi?
[177:55.69]Like even the Wii, right?
[177:58.55]Oh, the Wii, yeah, the Wii had like Wi-Fi built into it.
[178:01.04]Like, holy shit, it's been that long.
[178:03.73]Since that technology has existed.
[178:05.27]Which is not even that long if you think about it.
[178:06.47]It's been like 15 years.
[178:10.13]But the Wii had a fucking Wi-Fi chip in it.
[178:12.45]It's just crazy to think about that.
[178:15.20]Wild.
[178:17.94]Hey, The Dashu.
[178:19.12]Thanks for the $9.27.
[178:20.66]What's up, J-Man?
[178:22.90]Today's my last day of college and I want to say I couldn't have done it without you.
[178:26.44]I don't believe that.
[178:28.24]I don't believe that at all.
[178:30.96]I think you had it in you the whole time.
[178:34.06]I had nothing to do with it.
[178:36.66]It was you, man.
[178:39.74]Your streams have made me laugh and cheer me up when nothing else could.
[178:41.84]I'm about to graduate with a 4.0.
[178:46.17]Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[178:47.73]Well, thank you.
[178:49.95]And good job you doing that.
[178:52.27]I didn't do it.
[178:54.27]You did it.
[178:54.67]I had nothing to do with it.
[178:55.53]You did it.
[178:55.89]Give yourself some credit.
[179:01.72]Nice work.
[179:02.08]That's fucking huge.
[179:04.60]That's huge.
[179:08.83]Thanks for the $9.27.
[179:14.52]Grave, embraced thanks for 250, cut him into germicized pieces.
[179:18.30]Ooh.
[179:18.46]Oh yeah, I did say that.
[179:20.52]Yeah, well, that was because that's the way you get rid of Nemesis.
[179:24.38]You just have to... I can't even say it again, because we're out of context now, and people are gonna fucking just flip it and... I'm gonna be a serial killer.
[179:32.77]Or like a psycho or something.
[179:34.59]You know what I said.
[179:35.07]It was yesterday.
[179:36.75]Just watch the entire 8-hour stream, and you'll find it eventually.
[179:39.37]If you have time.
[179:41.29]If not, then who cares?
[179:43.48]If I have that kind of effect on somebody.
[180:17.24]Sometimes it's hard to respond, to be honest.
[180:19.78]Because... I can't even believe it.
[180:23.50]Like, I can't even... It's hard for me to even give you anything, an answer, or even a comment.
[180:29.63]Because this shit floors me.
[180:34.03]I can't believe that people think this and say this.
[180:36.27]It's unbelievable to me.
[180:40.82]All I can say is thanks for watching.
[180:43.44]And I really hope that you take the steps necessary to take care of yourself and move forward.
[180:48.39]Thank you so much for the insanely kind message.
[180:57.22]Just slap yourself, see if you're dreaming.
[180:58.80]I'm not.
[181:03.44]Thank you.
[181:07.72]Take care of yourself.
[181:11.40]Why would I want to save you from the greatest thing on earth?
[181:13.28]Why would I want to rescue you in your utmost perfect place that you're in?
[181:39.79]Stay in Diablo.
[181:41.63]Stay in hell.
[181:45.51]You want to be there.
[181:46.85]It's awesome.
[181:47.65]You're going to love it.
[181:48.41]I'm so glad you're in hell.
[181:50.07]I'm so glad you're here.
[181:51.77]With me in hell.
[181:57.95]Go to hell.
[181:59.63]It's a great game.
[182:02.85]Thanks for the $5.
[182:03.95]Have fun with it.
[182:04.53]It's a fucking great franchise.
[182:06.20]Just stop at $3.
[182:08.97]Just play 3.
[182:11.53]Play 3 like you would play an iPad game.
[182:14.96]Just pretend 3 was an iPad game.
[182:16.86]It was like, oh, it's the iPad version.
[182:23.98]So don't.
[182:24.80]No, I mean like play it.
[182:25.60]It's like fun, but it's like iPad fun.
[182:29.22]Let's be completely honest with everybody here.
[182:31.38]Diablo 3 is iPad game fun.
[182:34.56]It's not Diablo 2 fun.
[182:38.82]It's still fun.
[182:46.09]So it's not fun.
[182:46.81]No, iPad games are fun.
[182:48.09]They're just a different kind of fun.
[182:54.06]A.S.
[182:54.72]Haluko, thanks for the $2.50.
[182:56.42]Gotta head out early, early morning tomorrow.
[182:58.42]Thanks for the laughs and the Lego hair.
[183:00.08]People are happy.
[183:00.78]Thank you.
[183:02.36]We did go late last night.
[183:04.10]That's a huge insult.
[183:07.97]Is it?
[183:08.83]It's not meant to be.
[183:13.20]I guess maybe it is.
[183:14.22]I'm just saying, it's not a major insult.
[183:19.86]Yeah, that's a really... Name one fun iPad game.
[183:27.57]There are a ton.
[183:29.15]There actually are a lot.
[183:31.93]There's a lot.
[183:32.65]There's a lot.
[183:36.11]Sorcery was on the iPad.
[183:37.61]Okay, excuse me.
[183:38.63]Hit the brakes for a second.
[183:41.18]Sorcery was not on Steam.
[183:43.08]Sorcery was an iOS exclusive experience for the first three or four years it was out.
[183:51.14]That's a port to PC.
[183:54.46]And that's one of the greatest games ever.
[183:57.62]So, I think that gets some points to the iPad side there.
[184:05.39]Hello Neighbor Tooth Surgery.
[184:15.61]We were gonna do another iPad night where I just download a bunch of junk.
[184:21.58]And it freaks me the fuck out sometimes when I'm looking at iPad games that are just crazy.
[184:26.36]Because, yeah, there's just... There's these games where there's people with their mouths open.
[184:33.65]It's just like rotten teeth and like holes in their teeth and shit.
[184:36.87]It's like every single Cartoon character every single Marvel character every single thing Every they all have these like teeth rotten teeth games But why that why why like teeth I like teeth surgery I
[185:03.70]I see it everywhere.
[185:04.92]Every time I'm like, I'm looking for like a, oh, I'm going to do a crazy iPad night.
[185:08.98]Teeth surgery, surgery, teeth surgery, mouth, dentist, dentist, dentist, dentist, dentist, dentist, rotten teeth, teeth, teeth, like green teeth, green teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.

[185:38.35]Do you eat your milk with or without the skin?
[185:41.54]I don't drink milk.
[185:43.74]It upsets my stomach at this point.
[185:45.58]I drink almond milk.
[185:47.94]I don't drink any other milk.
[185:49.88]I don't drink soy milk.
[185:52.24]I don't drink oat milk.

[185:58.78]My stomach, I have intestinal issues.
[186:02.33]Milk doesn't really sit well with me.
[186:04.33]I can eat a piece of cheese or two, but I can't.

[191:49.37]Back at it again with another game request.
[191:52.29]If you liked Mario Galaxy and Sunshine, I recommend a little game called A Hat in Time.
[191:56.24]It's a cute 3D platformer that you can make for a cozy stream.
[192:00.40]You know, I've had that game installed for like three years.
[192:07.68]But I just never did it.
[192:09.53]Yeah.
[192:13.09]Hypo worked on that game.

[192:46.55]We'll see.
[192:48.09]They also say don't skip Pikmin 1 if you get around to that series.
[192:51.64]I'm going to.
[192:52.14]I'm sorry.
[192:54.10]I'm going to play Pikmin 2.
[192:55.48]I'm sorry.
[192:56.94]I'm going to skip Pikmin 1.
[192:58.72]It has been unanimously told to me that Pikmin 1 is the one to skip.
[193:02.36]Pikmin 2 is Pikmin 1.
[193:04.34]But just better.
[193:06.44]I've been told that's going to... I'm sorry.
[193:08.06]I have to do it.
[193:11.29]That's so wrong.
[193:12.25]It was like an 80% vote.
[193:15.54]I have to trust the people.
[193:19.16]Plus, I don't think I'd play more than one Pikmin game.
[193:22.59]I don't think I will.
[193:24.67]I gotta tell you honesty.
[193:27.17]I don't think I'm gonna play more than one Pikmin game.
[193:30.34]There's like four of them.
[193:34.34]I have to pick the one that people think is the best.
[193:46.21]Pikmin 2 is going to be a crack cocaine stream.
[193:49.15]Maybe it will.
[193:53.53]Hey, spooky future.

[194:23.42]I've been stood down from work due to COVID.
[194:26.59]Been working on videos in the downtime to keep me sane.
[194:28.99]Encouragement like yours is appreciated.
[194:34.23]Yeah, I mean, tons of people just got...
[194:38.46]furloughed or laid off for nothing.
[194:41.46]They didn't do anything wrong.
[194:42.61]It's not like, oh, we have to get rid of you because of this, because of that.
[194:45.61]Virus fucking swept into the goddamn world.
[194:48.49]Into the states, I don't know where you are.
[194:51.52]And into Europe, into Asia, everywhere.
[194:56.38]These employees didn't do anything wrong.
[194:58.62]It's just really heartbreaking to fucking hear about it.
[195:01.05]I hope that a majority of, if you're working right now, or if you're not working, I mean, I really hope a majority of you go back to where you were before.
[195:11.59]Or maybe if you don't want to go back, maybe you'll have a different career path that you can go forward with.
[195:16.81]Because that sucks.
[195:20.48]That just sucks.
[195:22.62]And it breaks my fucking heart to hear about it.
[195:32.20]I wish you the best.
[195:32.74]Thank you Omni Cash for the $5.
[195:38.01]Play the newer Bubsy games.
[195:39.87]I don't think so.
[195:40.69]One of them I threw up almost.
[195:42.81]I threw up into my mother's bed after playing Bubsy 3D, so I don't want to do that again.
[195:50.22]Phantom Tech, thanks for $3.
[195:51.10]Jeremy, you're the best man.
[195:52.34]Thanks for being such an awesome and creative streamer.
[195:54.08]Your vids are the best.
[195:55.17]Keep up the good work.
[195:57.84]Just an insanely nice, encouraging thing to hear.
[196:00.68]I'm going to try.
[196:02.20]I'll do my best.
[196:03.32]Thank you.
[196:07.83]Convo Breaker.
[196:08.79]Thanks for the $3,250.
[196:11.51]Dear Jeremiah, when I said Xenoblade Chronicles 1 was the Chrono Trigger of our decade, I didn't think it should be a stream game at all.
[196:17.76]It should be something that you enjoy on your own.
[196:20.68]Taking the time to soak in the world.
[196:22.04]The same goes for chat.
[196:22.96]The game is great.
[196:24.58]As long as you don't mind talking to all the NPCs.
[196:26.88]All of them.
[196:28.18]They're interesting.
[196:28.74]Don't worry.
[196:29.68]Pyre, however, is a great stream game.
[196:32.54]It's basically NBA Jam, the choose-your-own-adventure game.
[196:36.76]Also has a mustached airbud.
[196:38.42]Is that true?
[196:44.23]hire is the nba jam of choose your own adventure games I'm trying to break that apart I'm trying to figure out how what that means the nba jam it's basically nba jam to choose your own adventure game higher is good but it makes no sense lol yes I don't lie in donations
[197:11.65]Okay.
[197:12.23]Alright, I'll look it up.
[197:13.47]Pyre?
[197:14.51]E-Y-R-E?
[197:15.77]Yeah, I'll check it out.
[197:19.03]Yeah, but I also...
[197:42.83]I also want you... I want people... I want you to get better.
[197:46.75]I want people to get better.
[197:49.04]I want you to move forward in your life.
[197:50.62]I want you to take care of yourself.
[197:53.58]And sometimes, you know, when you hear stuff like, Oh, Jerma, you're the reason why.
[197:57.34]You're the only reason why I've been able to... I... I wish it wasn't just me.
[198:02.08]I really want you to get better.
[198:05.40]And if that's the case, then... I don't know if that's not this exact comment, but... I want you guys to take care of yourselves.
[198:14.48]And I think it would be selfish of me to sit here and be like, yup.
[198:18.45]Yup.
[198:18.67]It's me.
[198:19.41]It's me.
[198:19.79]Yup.
[198:20.13]Stay.
[198:20.97]Only watch me.
[198:22.63]I feel like that's selfish for me to ever have that cross my mind.
[198:26.61]So I really, really implore anybody that is feeling bad or terrible and this stream is an outlet for them to be a part of.
[198:34.18]I really hope you take the necessary steps to try to move forward and get better.
[198:47.18]Because I don't want to be... I don't want to be that.
[198:54.45]If that makes any sense.
[198:55.19]Because I feel like that's, like I said, I feel like that's selfish for me to think like that.
[199:01.51]And not say something about it.
[199:06.19]But thank you so much.
[199:07.43]I really hope you move forward.
[199:11.37]Whatever those situations are, whatever the last few weeks have done, I really hope you got through it.
[199:16.85]Good luck at university.
[199:18.90]Thanks for the $5.
[199:26.54]Hey, Raindrop, thanks for $2.50.
[199:28.16]Jeremy, wanted to let you know that mashing buttons fast is seriously called jacking.
[199:33.28]Just so you know, you're like a self-proclaimed number one jacker.
[199:38.17]And if you don't want to say that out loud, that's cool.
[199:40.33]Just know that you fucking rock.
[199:42.33]Thanks for everything.
[199:42.97]Been watching since 2014 when I searched TF2 Diaper on YouTube and found Ster's Diaper Teleporter video.
[199:51.64]Question.
[199:52.82]Why did you type in TF2 Diaper into a search?
[199:57.77]What were you trying to gain from TF2 Diaper as a Google search?
[200:08.28]And even more awful, a video that I'm a part of comes up.
[200:15.48]One of Star's videos comes up.
[200:21.78]TF2 diaper, germa985.
[200:24.12]And Stir, the two diaper-wearing TF2 players.
[200:31.45]Oh no, the brand.
[200:33.13]What do we do?
[200:35.17]That's fucking, that's fucking funny.
[200:37.21]Thanks for the $2.50.
[200:39.97]Boiki, thanks for $5.
[200:41.11]Hey guys, turnips are selling at $439.

[200:58.27]Omni Cash, thanks for $5.
[200:59.87]Do a staring contest stream.
[201:01.63]I would, no.
[201:03.17]I would sit there for five minutes and then be like, I'm done.
[201:05.19]I would have to move.
[201:07.09]Omni Cash again, thanks for the $5.
[201:08.55]Do a yodeling stream.
[201:13.17]I could do it.
[201:17.09]Not now, it's been too long.
[201:18.77]Remind me to do yodels.
[201:19.91]I could probably do it.
[201:20.79]I could probably actually do it.
[201:23.31]If you catch me on like an hour one of the stream, I guarantee you I could be able to yodel really well.
[201:30.13]Fuck, I just punched you.
[201:31.21]You alright?
[201:31.53]Alright, I'm sorry.
[201:32.71]Remind me.
[201:36.89]Hey, IkeTurtle, thanks for 250.
[201:38.27]When is the Fortnite stream?
[201:39.93]We can play duos and get the dub.

[201:46.36]It's not going to happen.

[203:21.66]I'm telling you.

[203:39.37]Appreciate that.
[203:39.91]Thank you.
[203:41.63]Hey, Jojo360, thanks for 1,000 bits.
[203:46.22]Hopefully this works.
[203:46.86]It's my first time to try donating.
[203:48.10]I've been a sub on the YouTube channel, both the dead one and the second one, for a couple years.
[203:54.09]But with being stuck inside, I figured I'd go actually try to watch a stream.
[203:57.63]Tonight's stream was definitely a favorite, and I probably owe you more.
[204:00.85]But as a college kid, it's easier said than done.
[204:03.42]Thanks for helping me and everyone else through these times.
[204:07.84]No, you never, don't ever, don't give me any money.
[204:13.70]$10 is, that's, that's,
[204:16.74]You paid for a subscription to a ton of these fucking places that have tons of shit and tons of value.
[204:23.72]I appreciate, I really appreciate people giving me money.
[204:27.31]$10, $50, $1,000, $500, $10, $1, $2, $5, $5, $5, $5.
[204:27.69]But I really hope that you're doing that because you feel like doing that and you want to do that.
[204:31.67]You don't have to ever.
[204:42.42]I would actually implore a lot of you that don't have a lot of money to not and to save it and take care of yourself first.
[204:49.55]Absolutely.
[204:56.59]I sound like a broken record when I say this, but I really, I hit it, I hammer it because I want to make sure it's real clear.
[205:04.88]Take care of yourself.
[205:05.76]Save your money.
[205:07.30]You don't got to give it to me.
[205:13.08]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks.
[205:18.69]Finally, the end here.
[205:21.07]Move to the end.
[205:23.33]The actual end of the stream.
[205:28.57]The German subscription takes precedence over everything.
[205:32.85]If you feel like that, sure.
[205:35.18]But you don't have to do that.
[205:38.16]If you have to choose between give Jerma985 $10 and buy $10 worth of cheesy gordita crunches, I hope you make the right choice.
[205:52.24]I hope you make the right choice there.
[206:02.51]Hey Post, thanks for $5.
[206:04.49]I'm going to keep bugging you to check out Receiver 2 until you do.
[206:10.93]Uh... Receiver 2.

[206:17.47]No, this is on the list.
[206:21.75]No, it's not.
[206:22.25]It's not this way.
[206:23.47]This isn't VR?
[206:27.37]What is this?
[206:31.77]What game do I have that's this game?
[206:33.89]It's not VR.
[206:42.57]This actually looks pretty fucking good.
[206:46.03]Don't I own this or something?
[206:47.93]There's a VR game that looks exactly like this.
[206:50.07]Alright, put it on the list.
