[01:58.02]Hi.
[01:59.10]Hey, sorry.
[01:59.78]I'm like, I'm sitting here trying to think of like a title for this stream.
[02:03.16]And I can't think of one.
[02:07.71]I'm desperately sitting here going like, what the fuck do I want to title this stream?
[02:11.93]I can't think.
[02:13.65]First it was Mewtwo.
[02:15.65]I didn't like that.
[02:16.93]I think I'm gonna change it.
[02:21.80]Is Monsters, is that okay?
[02:23.66]Or is that like too much of a shitty, like, this streamer's trying so hard to make a joke?
[02:38.87]What do you guys think?
[02:47.35]Evil within my bowels.
[02:56.19]Whatever, who cares?
[02:57.09]Like, the title doesn't matter.
[03:03.86]What matters is the content in the middle.
[03:08.00]Let me just move this over here.
[03:10.37]I'm gonna put this in my ear.
[03:14.87]Funny streamer joke title.
[03:16.39]It's not even a joke.
[03:18.01]I'm just a fucking dumbass.
[03:19.15]That's all that matters.
[03:21.68]But welcome.
[03:22.50]Hi.
[03:24.18]We are about to queue into this.
[03:26.64]Oh, we're gonna queue into it.
[03:29.20]There's even within through.
[03:31.19]There's even within through.
[03:35.58]Insecurity.
[03:37.51]I have a lot of insecurities.
[03:40.47]Trust me on that one.
[03:48.05]Alright, so, and, of course, because we're playing a scary game, here comes the facecam.com!
[03:57.63]Oh, by the way, this thought just popped into my brain.
[04:01.17]You got bitcoins?
[04:02.70]Whoa!
[04:04.43]You see when that shit happened?
[04:06.29]I got 30 bitcoins.
[04:07.39]I have 40 bitcoins.
[04:10.03]I'm a fucking trillionaire now.
[04:12.57]No, I don't own any bitcoins, but, uh, did you see that shit from today?
[04:17.26]Like Bitcoin, like fucking exploded.
[04:21.68]It's worth like $6,000 now.
[04:24.34]How fucking insane is that?
[04:25.40]Like this whole, the whole currency thing, it's like some type of currency thing, in my opinion.
[04:30.97]You know what I'm saying?
[04:34.63]The angle?
[04:35.05]What do you mean the angle?
[04:40.95]That's... I saw that on the news.
[04:43.33]That was newsworthy today.
[04:45.27]That's how fucking crazy... Nice wrinkles.
[04:46.88]Hey!
[04:48.34]I don't see shit.
[04:49.18]I don't see any wrinkles.
[04:49.92]I just see a couple of zits.
[04:54.06]I'm turning into a Great Gatsby extra.
[05:00.58]That's what they do in the Great Gatsby, right?
[05:02.69]Somebody says something, somebody goes like this, somebody's like, oh, that's why.
[05:05.88]And that's why I told her.
[05:07.34]I don't think so.
[05:09.46]And like, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.
[05:11.56]Like fucking like trumpets are playing in the background and shit.
[05:18.09]Nice receding hairline.
[05:19.13]I know.
[05:19.95]I'm fucking 32.
[05:22.25]What do you think?
[05:23.29]I'm like fucking 20?
[05:25.63]I'm 32.
[05:27.09]You're lucky that you see me with this much hair on my fucking head.
[05:32.70]I didn't even fucking tweet that.
[05:36.10]Hold on, let me tweet that.
[05:40.24]I want you guys to see my phone password.
[05:41.94]Okay.
[05:51.50]Safety!
[05:52.30]It's one, two, three, four, you know?
[05:57.28]It probably would be.
[06:01.30]So...
[06:03.46]I'm sorry for starting so late.
[06:05.90]Let's be real here.
[06:09.10]I've been... I'm getting, like, re-evaluated.
[06:10.92]My whole colitis, Crohn's, proctitis, like, intestinal IBD bullshit is causing me a lot of problems lately.
[06:20.98]And it's... That's all I gotta say.
[06:23.12]That's it.
[06:23.42]I'm getting re-evaluated.
[06:24.58]Hopefully we can figure out why it's coming back with a vengeance.
[06:28.48]Man, like, I've been diagnosed, like, three fucking times now.
[06:31.81]Like, twice now.
[06:33.44]I'm going in three times.
[06:35.28]It's getting annoying.
[06:37.25]Anyways.
[06:40.03]There's no excuse.
[06:41.73]I'm not giving you an excuse, but here's an excuse.
[06:43.49]That's the excuse.
[06:45.39]I'm full of excuses.
[06:49.99]My new streamer... You know TwitchCon?
[06:54.46]When they announce the people that are going to be there?
[07:01.82]Okay, oh here comes German, Jerma985.
[07:03.98]Everybody has their own like little taglines and shit.
[07:07.40]People have like what they're known as like, oh, I'm as like the variety streamer.
[07:12.33]Oh, if you find me on the, on the Overwatch circuit, Jerma985.
[07:18.11]Full of excuses.
[07:23.51]It's pretty much the way it is.
[07:25.37]Anyways, let's go.
[07:26.38]I'm gonna play the Evil Within 2.
[07:27.72]We're gonna at least start it, or try to play it, right?
[07:33.33]Who knows?
[07:33.63]Let's wait for the Twitter people to come on in.
[07:39.01]I'm drinking coffee at 8.30 because I have to.
[07:43.46]Actually, some bits came in.
[07:45.94]Thank you, Holeof1Zombie, for the $5.
[07:47.34]I don't see dead people.
[07:51.04]Streamer is late.
[07:51.94]That's true.
[07:52.74]I was very late today.
[07:54.77]But thank you, HoloBunsLP, for the five bucks.
[07:56.73]Stix Renegade.
[07:57.35]Stix, thanks for the five dollars.
[07:59.11]Here's some money for your incoming colonoscopy.
[08:01.45]How bad is your Crohn's?
[08:02.76]Anyway, I'm almost in remission.
[08:05.12]I hope you get there.
[08:06.70]I hope you get in remission.
[08:07.72]I was in fucking total... This is what sucks the most about having IBD, right?
[08:13.46]I was like... Life was pain.
[08:17.28]For like two and a half years.
[08:18.62]You know what I mean?
[08:19.91]And then, going forward from that...
[08:24.05]I got everything, like, I got on a new medication, and it, like, fixed itself.
[08:28.68]And I was completely fucking fine for, like, a full year and a half.
[08:33.28]So, it's great.
[08:34.46]Well, you know, like, you know, I have to go to the bathroom fucking 12 times a day.
[08:39.36]And I'm very candid about it.
[08:40.82]Like, I'll talk very candidly about it, because who cares, right?
[08:44.51]Like, what do I care about?
[08:46.01]And I say, oh, the life, okay, yeah.
[08:47.65]I see what you're doing here.
[08:49.11]But anyways, I...
[08:51.06]Whatever you happen to have, if you have, fuck it.
[08:52.84]Because that's the thing, when you have, like, Crohn's, like, I was diagnosed, like, years ago, they thought I had something else.
[09:00.82]Then they thought I had something else.
[09:01.86]Then they thought I had something else.
[09:03.12]Well, you know, they're all so similar.
[09:04.67]They're all so fucked up that it's so hard to treat and it's so hard to talk about.
[09:09.03]It's like, and now, the number one medication for, like, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's nowadays is, like, a fucking arthritis medicine.
[09:20.23]You know, like Humira.
[09:22.17]People take that shit for their, like, bony hands.
[09:25.39]Yeah, give it a fucking UC patience.
[09:27.94]Yeah, it'll be fine.
[09:29.38]Nobody don't want to get any more arthritis, I can guarantee you that.
[09:33.48]Fucking stupid.
[09:34.36]But I'm fine, don't worry about me.
[09:35.30]I'm gonna be fine.
[09:36.98]It's just annoying to deal with sometimes.
[09:40.16]Old woman streamer.
[09:41.70]I mean, my bones kind of hurt.
[09:44.26]Okay, my nails have been clipped.
[09:46.92]Just making sure.

[13:55.14]Anyways, thank you, Upward Fern, for the five bucks.
[13:58.04]Hey, Jerma, I have a dilemma.
[13:59.04]I'm currently working for my dad, but it's not exactly the best from moving out and getting my own place.
[14:04.66]But I have a chance to get into electric boat help and put together... I think the Twitter list may have eaten your comment, but... Essentially, he's asking if he has a chance to stop working with his dad.
[14:22.41]But he doesn't want to hurt his dad's feelings or hurt his dad by not working for him.
[14:27.61]No.
[14:28.09]Oh, fuck.
[14:28.63]Hold on.
[14:28.93]No, this is not happening.
[14:30.09]Oh, there's a fire here.
[14:32.05]Uh, honestly, you... It depends on how old you are, right?
[14:37.50]If you're, like, over the age of, like, 18... Oh, God, Lily!
[14:43.36]I'm trying to give you, like, life advice.
[14:45.08]Now, let me tell you something, guys.
[14:46.10]Like, here's some, like, good life advice while, like, a fucking house burns down in front of me.
[14:50.16]God, let me... Like, here's how you fix your life.
[14:52.89]Like, hold on just one sec.
[14:54.77]Let me just, like, get it... Oh, it's fucking mapped to...
[15:00.34]I'm using a fucking place- I'm gonna- this is gonna screw me up the whole game.
[15:03.30]Guaranteed.
[15:03.74]Let's get in the slider.
[15:10.07]Uh, oh, looks like we're going- nope.
[15:14.63]Okay, I thought that was a mannequin.
[15:15.85]I was like, why do you have a mannequin in your house?
[15:18.31]Uh, but anyways.
[15:22.05]That was a very quick scream.
[15:25.11]I was like, Lily!
[15:26.27]Where are you?
[15:29.18]It was like a one second, like... Is Lily a pet bird, or is Lily, like, my daughter?
[15:36.81]How did this happen?
[15:38.75]Okay, hold on.
[15:39.27]Make sure there's no, like, ammo.
[15:40.85]Is that a shoe in the fucking dishwasher?
[15:42.53]No.
[15:44.25]Focus!
[15:45.39]Focus!
[15:46.19]What are you doing?
[15:46.89]Get upstairs!
[15:51.32]This one's covered.
[15:53.30]No, it's not.
[15:54.86]Oh, what about this one?
[15:57.00]Okay, I can't go in that door.
[16:00.17]Let's go this way.
[16:01.61]No, that's a window.
[16:05.65]You just opened it.
[16:06.21]You gonna kick it again?
[16:06.92]Alright, up.
[16:10.86]Alright, I'm coming.
[16:13.02]Why would I go... Go spas... Go faster than this.
[16:20.12]You could definitely sprint.
[16:23.18]See?
[16:24.35]It's two people.
[16:25.07]It's the daughter and there's a bird.
[16:28.56]The bird's in a separate room, and we can't worry about the bird right now.
[16:37.09]I wonder which... Hmm.
[16:38.93]I wonder which room is Lily's.
[16:42.95]And she escaped.
[16:43.51]She made it out.
[16:44.61]What?
[17:02.54]Get out of the house.
[17:06.82]Yeah, this is not a time for a family reunion.
[17:08.72]Get out of the house.
[17:09.32]Go out the window.
[17:09.98]Go now.
[17:10.60]Go right now.
[17:13.30]Oh, this is a nightmare.
[17:28.45]Fucking two agent smiths.
[17:31.17]I don't fucking trust the two men in black over there.
[17:34.64]Fucking agent.
[17:35.42]I've seen that movie before.
[17:36.94]They're gonna like punch me in the chest and like absorb me.
[17:45.10]There she is.
[17:47.97]20 years later.
[17:49.67]30.
[17:51.33]Lily Kidman.
[17:52.05]It's been a long time.
[17:56.85]three years and I I played the first trying to track you down for three years the first came for about 12 minutes you'd find me at the bottom of an empty bottle tldr what's going on here and why are you here now damn it you didn't find me because they didn't want you to calm down sebastian you knew what was going to happen in that hospital didn't you
[18:19.45]What happened at Beacon is in the past.
[18:20.71]Three years.
[18:21.93]It's been three years since the last game.
[18:23.89]You sound just like that psychologist the force shoved down my throat.
[18:28.72]But he didn't have answers.
[18:30.28]Seven minutes.
[18:31.28]Seven minutes is all I can give you.
[18:32.78]You're gonna tell me about Mobius.
[18:40.11]And then she lifts up the fucking plate in front of her and who's getting chopped?
[18:44.65]See?
[18:47.35]I'm here because of this.
[18:53.28]I was like, what?
[18:54.78]You have like a piece of construction paper?
[18:59.63]I'm here because of this.
[19:00.23]You threw this out your car.
[19:04.35]You threw this out your car window back on like I-94.
[19:07.73]I'm gonna track you down.
[19:14.10]Lily is dead!
[19:16.48]I read the police report.
[19:18.64]I was at her funeral.
[19:20.28]We can rewrite history if we want to.
[19:23.18]What?
[19:23.74]Staging a death is child's play.
[19:27.21]Why would I come out of the shadows just to lie to you?
[19:30.07]Why would I come out of the shadows?
[19:31.59]Lily is alive.
[19:33.63]And she's with us.
[19:36.11]But she's in danger.
[19:37.39]We are.
[19:38.37]We need you to help save her.
[19:39.96]Organization 666.
[19:40.96]Save her?
[19:44.24]What have you done to her?
[19:47.54]See?
[19:49.62]Here comes the fucking Neo fight scene.
[19:53.10]I told you.
[19:57.93]I got syringed.
[20:01.11]I was hoping you'd come willingly, Sebastian.
[20:03.93]People overuse the syringe mechanic in video.
[20:06.55]All right, the syringe mechanic in video games is like the biggest trope.
[20:14.85]It's like a Hollywood trope in a movie.
[20:17.47]It's like the broom, it's the broom animation.
[20:20.27]Does everybody have to have a syringe gun?
[20:25.24]What's in a syringe?
[20:26.82]What's in there?
[20:28.04]And if you stick a syringe like that with a liquid directly into somebody's neck, what substance, it's purple.
[20:34.91]Are you like injecting Pepto-Bismol into their neck?
[20:37.37]Is that like what happens?
[20:42.26]The broom.
[20:43.95]The broom animation.
[20:45.77]Look.
[20:46.09]Okay.
[20:50.69]Over, under.
[20:51.37]Place your bets.
[20:51.93]Over, under for this.
[20:53.53]Are we gonna see somebody using a broom?
[20:55.77]Like, just, like, a guy using a broom on, like, a sidewalk.
[20:59.66]Has to be, like, in a place where, like, he normally wouldn't be a broom and a person using it.
[21:03.30]So, guy doing broom on sidewalk.
[21:06.80]Okay.
[21:08.98]Or guy doing broom in, like, a bathroom stall.
[21:13.48]20 bucks on that one.
[21:15.10]No, you don't think so?
[21:15.68]He's an ex-con?
[21:16.50]Why am I so small?
[21:17.92]I'm like coming up to her like middle of her elbow.
[21:22.64]Okay.
[21:23.02]Oh my god, it's GLaDOS.
[21:41.29]The Beacon Mental Hospital incident was an unfortunate setback.
[21:47.24]This is just Outlast.
[21:48.30]But we used the knowledge gained to build a new and vastly improved STEM system.
[21:54.57]This is the end of Outlast.
[21:56.09]Spoilers if you haven't seen it.
[21:57.51]This is it.
[21:58.65]What does this have to do with my daughter?
[22:01.75]Imagine it.
[22:03.23]Millions of minds connected together.
[22:06.70]It should be Albert Busker.
[22:09.23]I just wanted to tell you.
[22:09.95]The milk matrix machine?
[22:10.79]What?
[22:10.95]Uh-oh, she's inside of that can of soup!
[22:35.06]You turned my daughter into soup.
[22:36.40]How could you?
[22:37.01]Wait, what?
[22:37.67]Oh, I'm done.
[22:38.49]I'm done.
[22:39.11]That explains why I was... That explains... That explains it.
[22:43.17]Uh, God.
[22:43.83]Thanks to her, Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup.
[22:58.82]It's so much more delicious.
[23:00.85]A little over a week ago, Lily vanished.
[23:05.13]Just stopped sending signals.
[23:07.15]Gee, man.
[23:08.67]Then the STEM environment began to collapse.
[23:12.03]We thought it was just a technical glitch.
[23:14.42]So these people actually are in the Matrix.
[23:16.18]So we sent a team of Mobius agents inside.
[23:17.68]These Matrix bathtubs.
[23:19.52]But then we lost contact with them.
[23:21.31]That's a bootleg Matrix, by the way.
[23:22.93]You can't get cool chairs.
[23:24.39]You gotta buy bathtub cases at Home Depot.
[23:27.45]I am providing you an opportunity, not only to see your daughter again, but to save her life.
[23:34.14]Next?
[23:34.44]No, what?
[23:35.62]Next?
[23:36.00]What?
[23:36.52]We're not going to next.
[23:38.34]What are you talking about?
[23:39.98]This is an opening cutscene.
[23:41.76]I haven't even aimed with L2 yet.
[23:43.80]Or let her die.
[23:47.56]I'm a bathtub.
[23:48.16]It's your choice.
[23:50.28]Next.
[23:50.58]It's not next.
[23:51.74]This is what we're playing tonight.
[23:58.72]Alright, get into the bathtub.
[24:00.45]I think it actually is a bathtub.
[24:01.85]That was like a dumb joke, but it actually is.
[24:04.81]It really is bathtubs.
[24:06.15]Why is it actual bathtubs?
[24:07.93]You actually lie in water.
[24:08.69]It doesn't make any sense.
[24:19.68]Just remember to call me the moment you find Lily.
[24:22.72]So that we can begin the extraction process.
[24:25.76]I'll be out here for you.
[24:26.68]So I have to go into the Matrix and pull her out of the Matrix.
[24:33.62]Okay.
[24:33.84]And there's the thumb drive.
[24:36.43]Try out my new indie game.
[24:37.49]Something else will be in there for you.
[24:42.75]Are you ready?
[24:43.53]And by the way, please don't go into the folder with all my family photos.
[24:57.01]Mm-hmm.
[25:01.39]So how do I get into the Matrix?
[25:04.72]He's just lying in a bathtub.
[25:05.72]Am I gonna get another syringe in the back of the head?
[25:09.08]Alright, if there's a hole in the back of my head... Here it comes.
[25:13.88]Right in the back of the skull.
[25:26.23]It's just, it's just water.
[25:29.63]That's all it was.
[25:30.27]It was, you just lie in the water.
[25:32.64]And you fall, you fall.
[25:35.36]Dude, this, this happens, this happens in Get Out.
[25:38.92]The movie Get Out.
[25:40.58]The same exact sequence plays out.
[25:44.02]This exact scenario happens in Get Out.
[25:56.31]Wow.
[25:57.17]Okay.
[26:01.47]Now I'm floating.
[26:05.19]Wasn't the first one you, like, explore a mansion and shit?
[26:08.59]And you have, like, a gun?
[26:10.73]You know?
[26:14.55]There it is.
[26:14.95]There's the evil within, too.
[26:15.91]The evil within us all, apparently.
[26:17.71]Because the first one was about exploring, like, an old Capcom mansion, and this one is...
[26:25.09]Everybody has these demons that you have to go inside and find them.
[26:31.75]Figure it out.
[26:35.87]Is this... Where am I?
[26:40.09]No, where's Rom?
[26:43.19]Where's Rom?
[26:43.81]There he is.
[26:44.23]This was the shittiest boss in Bloodborne.
[26:49.01]And now it's the house.
[26:50.87]The house is the boss.
[26:53.92]I'm coming, Lily.
[26:55.48]Let's go.
[27:00.38]I know it's hard to accept Lyra, but she's gone.
[27:04.32]I got the FOB up pretty good, so this will be pretty good.
[27:06.54]Pretty good.
[27:07.52]No.
[27:09.23]I'll never accept it.
[27:10.53]You won't help me.
[27:11.35]My lips are always chapped nowadays.
[27:13.13]Okay.
[27:15.83]What the hell is this place?
[27:18.95]Detective, we've got a call.
[27:22.23]Oh, that's fucking like Disneyland.
[27:26.25]See?
[27:27.39]Watch when the light comes on.
[27:28.37]That's like the Magic Kingdom.
[27:31.39]Oh, that's just a desk.
[27:36.79]Oh, that's my desk.
[27:38.13]I'm gonna be spun around and it was like me.
[27:45.00]Hang on, ready?
[27:51.86]Oh, come on.
[27:52.34]I wanted to, like, spin the chair around.
[27:56.20]Inside the local police department building, inside... No, we're back in the mansion.
[28:03.95]Hello?
[28:05.53]Sebastian, are you there?
[28:06.99]Kidman?
[28:09.37]What?
[28:09.85]What's it say on there?
[28:13.15]1976.
[28:13.73]That's the year.
[28:14.17]That's gonna be on a combination on some block somewhere.
[28:16.79]Like the worst hangover ever.
[28:18.73]Don't worry.
[28:19.73]It will pass once your mind has adjusted.
[28:22.77]Yeah.
[28:24.51]So you really are just inside, like, a computer.
[28:26.47]That makes everything less scary, because I know nothing's real.
[28:29.64]It's like being in a dream.
[28:30.90]I'm using a phone to talk into the Matrix, huh?
[28:33.08]Very original of them.
[28:33.76]Alright, let's get down to business.
[28:54.55]You're up.
[28:55.71]What's his last name?
[28:56.59]Was this guy's last name Castle Lanz?
[28:59.33]Sebastian Castle Lanz.
[29:00.74]Fucking like Terrence and Philip drawing.
[29:02.20]Okay, what else we got?
[29:21.84]uh I got a hat rack we got others this is the investigation I was currently on there are photos of a bunch of mobius agents here your lost team I assume that's them let us know if you locate any of them castle lanos castle linds castle lanes union and searching for lily too union sebastian griffin's team was designed to look and feel like a small town called union great so your experts streamer mocks five-year-old drawing if anyone
[29:50.65]I'm not mocking it.
[29:51.41]I'm just saying it looks funny.
[29:53.97]Wow, that petticoat is not my petticoat.
[29:57.81]Okay, chapter two.
[30:05.49]That was a very quick chapter.
[30:09.49]Search for the Mobius search team members within STEM for a lead on finding Lily.
[30:14.53]Okay.
[30:15.27]So there's the cat.
[30:15.87]The cat's gonna talk.
[30:17.19]Just like in that fucking show.
[30:18.93]What was the show with, um...
[30:21.68]sarah jessica parker no sarah jessica the girl that played clarissa what was the name of that show clarissa explains it all and it was like it was something something uh to bring to the teenage witch here he comes he's gonna be like oh don't take that uh sebastian be careful with that paper slide projector where did my memory dig this up I saw the mouth open I was like it's gotta happen
[30:53.52]A relic from a pre-phone camera error.
[30:55.90]These are mostly found in old people's attics and estate sales.
[31:01.61]They can be viewed using the slide projector in Sebastian's room.
[31:07.07]Okay, let's operate the projector.
[31:09.21]Come on.
[31:11.45]Do it.
[31:11.71]I wish.
[31:18.68]It's just dad holding the coffee.
[31:20.08]It's not a big deal.
[31:23.31]Not a big deal.
[31:24.82]Dad's got the two coffees.
[31:27.70]While mom and daughter... Next.
[31:32.14]Who took the picture?
[31:32.56]Yeah, that's true.
[31:33.72]Somebody took this picture.
[31:35.06]I think Kidman took this picture.
[31:49.98]To manipulate me.
[31:51.84]To get me to perform like a good little soldier.
[31:53.72]The streamer forgets his daughter's name.
[31:55.20]I don't know what the fucking daughter's name is.
[31:57.70]Friendship was built on a lie.
[31:59.23]This is not a walking simulator.
[32:00.53]It's not.
[32:00.93]It's a scary game.
[32:01.63]It's a horror game.
[32:02.15]It's Friday the 13th.
[32:02.79]The game came out on Friday the 13th.
[32:04.07]That's how you know it's scary.
[32:07.05]I never had a family to lose.
[32:08.89]So it's just Resident Evil 2.
[32:10.21]Better to have loved and lost.
[32:11.77]Is that what you're saying?
[32:21.37]One sec.
[32:22.29]Hold on.
[32:24.13]Let me just move something here.
[32:26.89]Just get this fucking shit out of the way.
[32:29.14]Okay.
[32:29.40]Just had to do that real quick.
[32:33.02]I'm going to be sweating, by the way, if you're curious.
[32:44.15]Talk.
[32:45.29]Prove my point.
[32:46.45]Talk.
[32:46.61]Talk.
[32:48.93]Talk.
[32:52.08]green gel.
[32:52.90]It's gross and it usually comes from dead enemies.
[32:55.46]But if you collect it, you can use it to obtain increased abilities.
[33:03.30]He's gonna talk.
[33:03.98]I can't wait for that to happen.
[33:07.96]Mm-hmm.
[33:09.52]Should be a way out.
[33:12.20]Mm-hmm.
[33:15.51]Save terminals.
[33:16.35]Save terminals can be used to save your progress at any time.
[33:18.21]They can be found in safe houses and in Sebastian's room.
[33:22.09]So you just save the game like this.
[33:25.11]Show the cat's death.
[33:25.99]That was a bug on my neck, wasn't it?
[33:27.31]Did I get it?
[33:33.23]Something, something, something's not quite right.
[33:36.13]Oh my god, an illusion!
[33:38.45]What are you hiding?
[33:39.77]Did I do good?
[33:42.95]Did I do good?
[33:45.52]Watch the hair.
[33:45.98]Hey, hey, hey!
[33:46.48]Whoa, watch the hair.
[33:47.08]Watch the hair there.
[33:53.19]Here we go again.
[33:53.87]Eating my skin.
[33:55.96]Into the looking glass.
[33:59.24]Fucking Alice in Wonderland, Matrix, fucking dumbass game.
[34:02.86]Don't say that yet.
[34:04.02]Stop.
[34:04.34]Don't say that, guys.
[34:05.28]Stop saying that.
[34:06.26]We haven't even got to play the game yet.
[34:12.36]Chapter 3, incoming.
[34:14.12]There must be like eight chapters in the game.
[34:17.70]The first four are like cutscenes.
[34:20.18]Lily, what's wrong?
[34:22.76]I don't know, my weird default dolls.
[34:27.54]Awww.

[35:28.04]Uh-oh.
[35:31.34]The game's playing with time now.
[35:33.63]Alright, here we go.
[35:40.39]Game starts now.
[35:42.33]Watch out for the giant shadow.
[35:43.71]We have to make it to the other end.
[35:50.63]Is this the right place?
[35:51.55]I don't know.
[35:54.03]Front door.
[35:55.83]Let's just take a look around just to see.
[35:57.48]I got... Wait.

[36:00.88]Okay.
[36:01.86]Thanks for telling me I had a flashlight.
[36:05.42]I have a punch?
[36:07.12]How do I punch?
[36:12.08]That's clearly a fist.
[36:16.74]We didn't even get the flashlight tutorial yet, guys.
[36:24.35]I mean, the game runs pretty well.
[36:30.79]It's gonna be door and then door.
[36:32.15]Let me, like, lo- Watch, we gotta get the clues.
[36:34.59]We get- Oh, it was a fucking- They were wildly coyote-ing me.
[36:40.36]You're gonna pull a roadrunner on me?
[36:45.72]The only difference was I didn't, like, sprint straight into the wall.
[36:49.14]It didn't work, wildly coyote.
[36:50.42]It never works.
[36:52.08]Don't you understand?
[36:54.60]102.
[36:54.62]There it is.
[36:59.34]William Baker.
[37:05.61]Toggle flashlight.
[37:06.39]See, we just got the flashlight tutorial.
[37:10.23]This door don't open.
[37:13.14]Neither does that one.
[37:14.08]Is it neither or neither?
[37:15.00]What do you guys say?
[37:15.50]I usually say neither.
[37:17.52]Like either or either.
[37:19.38]It's either one.
[37:20.18]It's either one.
[37:22.20]Tomato.
[37:22.60]Tomato.
[37:22.88]Tomato.

[37:25.72]Or neither.
[37:27.86]Neither, yeah.
[37:28.58]Exactly.
[37:31.48]Neither.
[37:33.62]Now, we're going to Troy Baker's office.
[37:35.14]He's like, he's definitely in this game.
[37:38.46]What the hell?
[37:45.83]Oh, somebody's clearly playing super hot right now.
[37:49.89]One of the search team.
[37:53.46]No, no, no, Troy Baker.
[37:57.70]Troy Baker's playing Superhot.
[37:59.26]Alright, let's investigate.
[38:02.88]Super.
[38:03.72]Hot.
[38:04.66]Super.
[38:05.72]Hot.
[38:11.84]This music is fucking freaking me out too.
[38:16.46]Why do I feel like this is supposed to be a VR experience?
[38:18.72]Oh my god, the back of his head.
[38:22.68]That's not for a parental guidance audience.
[38:32.00]What kind of gun are you using?
[38:35.69]Did you shoot him with a gun or did you shoot him with a cannonball?
[38:39.67]What the fuck?
[38:44.63]Alright, look.
[38:45.94]Get me away from that shit.
[38:51.66]Silly bullets, apparently.
[38:53.50]Apparently.
[38:57.84]Telephone.
[38:58.38]Uh-oh.
[39:01.76]Mm-hmm.
[39:02.72]Don't turn around.
[39:03.72]Here come the jump scares.
[39:04.75]Something was on the ground over there.
[39:15.99]Investigate.
[39:17.53]Investigate like a little mouse hole.
[39:19.14]What am I looking at?
[39:23.22]So why don't I just move it?
[39:25.64]Operate it.
[39:27.22]Take out the fucking Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them book.
[39:31.38]And make sure to keep it out.
[39:33.26]And don't put it back.
[39:34.23]And don't make a terrible movie about it.
[39:41.47]What?
[39:41.63]Let me look over here.
[39:44.93]What's that?
[39:48.41]Files.
[39:48.89]1 out of 40.
[39:51.43]Whoever did this must have enjoyed it.
[39:54.35]Shots fired.
[39:56.07]It was a good movie.
[39:56.71]It was a good... You want to talk about this for a second?
[40:01.38]Should we pause?
[40:05.18]Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a really, really good movie.
[40:10.60]It was a great movie.
[40:11.86]They're building the Harry Potter universe.
[40:13.77]Oh, Ivermony.
[40:14.71]I'm from Ivermony.
[40:15.87]Cool stuff.
[40:17.27]Um...
[40:19.80]That was a good movie.
[40:20.72]There was two other movies in that movie, though.
[40:22.60]The other movie was Colin Farrell tries to get Satan Boy.
[40:28.10]That was the second movie.
[40:30.61]And the third movie was, hey, we're going to put a famous actor in this movie randomly for no reason.
[40:39.08]Like, the movie was way too long.
[40:42.26]If they just had him find beasts and find them and track them down and how to find them and where to get them, but they had to have this, like, whole huge arc of, like, this villain and all these supervillains and... Just give me the beasts and where do you get them?
[40:58.84]I liked that movie.
[41:03.01]Oh, no, he's like a, oh, look out, he's a floating jellyfish.
[41:06.29]Oh, that's the most dangerous of all the beasts.
[41:09.07]The osteoporosis, whatever the fuck it was.
[41:12.75]If you've never seen the movie, like, I'm not gonna give spoilers, but, like, what the fuck was that?
[41:17.70]Like, just show me the fucking rhino.
[41:20.50]And him, like, making funny rhino noises.
[41:23.54]Goddamn fucking George R.R.
[41:25.36]Tolkien Martin.
[41:27.52]Rowling.
[41:28.64]All right, I have, like, a photo of this guy.
[41:32.78]What did I just say?
[41:33.28]I just lost all track.
[41:34.92]I opened up the door, right?
[41:35.86]This thing.
[41:41.24]It wasn't a bad movie.
[41:42.10]I'm telling you, it wasn't a bad movie.
[41:45.73]But they made another movie and they put that movie inside of that movie.
[41:51.23]Give me the sequel if you want.
[41:52.75]Put that in the sequel.
[42:00.98]Fuck, J, R. Combining, I'm like, what am I doing this for?
[42:08.68]That's why I don't like doing face cam, because I sit really strangely.
[42:12.54]Hello?
[42:15.69]Yes?
[42:16.15]I need something else to drink.
[42:19.25]I might just start drinking a little.
[42:26.43]Who was that?
[42:27.95]That was the Halloween guy from Demon's Souls.
[42:30.89]He's going to come in this game too.
[42:35.15]That was... I'll never forget how funny that was.
[42:41.09]You want to talk about top 10 funniest things of the streams over the last two years?
[42:47.86]That's one of them.
[42:48.96]That's one of my favorite things I've ever seen in a game.
[42:55.08]Alright, let's focus.
[42:57.06]Let's just get, like, out of the tutorial.
[43:04.89]Oh no, she's gonna get slammed into a wall, and then slammed out, and then the trailer's gonna move to the next clip.
[43:15.05]Can't go in that way.
[43:15.71]A whole lot of dead ends.
[43:21.12]Can I slide?
[43:23.54]No.
[43:24.48]I can crouch.
[43:27.49]Watch every photo be of, like, that guy's head being exploded.
[43:32.36]Lies, all lies.
[43:37.98]Congratulations, Truthseeker.
[43:41.58]Thank you for taking this lore.
[43:48.79]No, the layers of fear, like, baby thing, yeah.
[43:53.33]That was un-fucking-believable.
[43:54.93]You know, I wish I could go back to past me.
[43:56.83]Get out of the way.
[44:00.07]If I could go back to past streamer, I would have sat there for an extra 20 minutes and tried to get, like, 100 to come out at the same time.
[44:07.53]But we just had to move on.
[44:09.07]It was getting too much.
[44:16.46]No.
[44:17.08]Let's just go up this.
[44:17.90]I do have, like, a stamina bar, huh?
[44:30.06]No nice nice fast turn It's got to be like a quick turn right all these games have this shit So I don't have to like go like that because it's I'm using a console controls That's gonna cost me the most All right, well let's go into like the clown room it comes in a jump scare get prepared for it
[44:54.20]Why did my flashlight go out?
[44:55.36]I didn't turn it off.
[44:59.74]Fucking Krusty the Clown.
[45:03.78]Why did I just do that?
[45:07.42]I did like a fucking pure away, whatever it's called.
[45:17.03]Wait, he's a magician now too.
[45:23.10]He just took a picture?
[45:26.36]Oh, shit, guys.
[45:29.20]Shit.
[45:29.62]This guy's playing Fatal Frame 2 in my game.
[45:32.86]This is not good.
[45:34.98]Hold right bumper, enter cover when the cover icon's displayed.
[45:38.42]Yeah, I have to hold that button down.
[45:51.33]Move alongside cover around corners.
[45:52.87]When near a corner and cover, an arrow icon will be displayed.
[45:55.19]Moving in the direction.
[45:55.73]Are you kidding?
[45:56.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:57.13]We just dive that way to not break cover.
[46:03.14]He's going to come over here.
[46:04.46]Wait, what?
[46:04.80]Oh, Jesus.
[46:16.36]Don't mind me.
[46:22.98]Get out of here!
[46:26.19]No, he won't hear that!
[46:27.13]Okay.
[46:33.03]This doesn't open.
[46:35.64]I gotta find a way out of here.
[46:37.46]Oh, these photos.
[46:38.60]Picasso paintings.
[46:43.89]It's gonna be like a bunch of different wacky shit in this game.
[46:46.81]See, anytime a video game tells you that there are no rules, and that's how you tell it, and then somebody's looking into the dollhouse.
[46:53.41]This is a dollhouse.
[46:54.09]Because they made it so they could have no rules.
[47:00.61]Hey, it's just inside of a fucking computer!
[47:03.49]Anything's gonna happen.
[47:07.34]That's why it makes it scarier that way.
[47:13.58]Benjamin fucking Franklin could show up and throw Knives Zappy.
[47:18.16]And I'd be like, oh, okay, that makes perfect sense.
[47:20.46]It's a computer.
[47:21.08]I don't like the graininess.
[47:27.36]It's getting... It's getting a little too grainy.
[47:30.31]Why is this... Get over here.
[47:33.53]Excuse this noise here.
[47:34.73]Why the fuck is this so far away?
[47:38.93]Spoiler alert, the game's not scary.
[47:41.63]Is it?
[47:43.02]I mean, I don't know.
[47:44.84]What are you showing me here?
[47:49.50]I don't know.
[47:50.08]I have a little indicator for no reason, apparently.
[47:52.00]What's down here?
[47:54.86]There he is.
[47:58.08]SOS, save our ship!
[48:00.90]Well, I'm not going that way.
[48:01.92]Let's go up.
[48:06.96]We can't go up.
[48:07.58]I have to go that way.
[48:08.40]We have to sneak.
[48:16.85]What am I doing?
[48:23.16]How do I move quickly from cover to cover without being seen?
[48:26.68]What was the prompt?
[48:32.32]I forget what the hell it was.
[48:33.60]Hold this to be in cover and then you can move quickly out of cover.
[48:41.48]Where the hell is this guy?
[48:47.13]He's obviously not here now.
[48:51.83]Dude, I can't wait.
[48:55.53]Mm-hmm.
[48:57.31]Right?
[48:57.56]Alright, what is that thing?
[48:58.82]Christ.
[49:01.46]Dude, I can't wait till the fucking theme song plays.
[49:04.58]And it goes, Go tell auntie Rogi.
[49:09.30]Go tell auntie Rogi.
[49:13.52]Go tell auntie Rogi.
[49:18.05]that every single fucking body, everyone is dead.
[49:37.19]Interesting.
[49:40.59]Nobody gets, nobody gets that.
[49:44.55]You need a fucking higher intelligence to understand... ...dreamer and more humor.
[49:51.69]Resident Evil 7!
[49:52.53]That's the fucking stupid theme song that plays when you press the A button.
[49:56.05]I mean, to be fair...
[50:17.50]Oh!
[50:18.41]Monsters!
[50:20.17]Whoa!
[50:21.61]Look at those monsters!
[50:29.19]Give me that one.
[50:30.09]You know what that's for.
[50:35.21]Oh, we've got hanging people.
[50:37.54]Man, to be fair, guys, you need to have a certain amount of IQ to be able to understand Rick and Morty German humor.
[50:49.52]One of these is gonna- the face is gonna come out and it's gonna be the cat.
[50:54.24]The cat had one of these.
[50:55.06]Remember the cat had the, uh... the thing on its... neck.
[51:05.19]No, apparently none of you do anything.
[51:07.43]I think I have to take the picture.
[51:10.45]How come I have- take the photo!
[51:12.63]I think I have to stand in front and, like, pose.
[51:17.41]Alright, say cheese.
[51:22.12]This is coffee.
[51:23.54]Alcohol.
[51:25.30]What are you talking about?
[51:26.90]Take the photo.
[51:28.84]I'm trying to line up for the photo and they won't do it.
[51:38.97]Shit.
[51:39.53]Okay.
[51:49.55]There's a hair stuck in my mouth.
[51:55.13]how it's still there it's still there get out of my mouth god damn it won't go away I'm gonna go brush my teeth I gotta shave my tongue
[52:25.62]No, I thought that was that guy again.
[52:26.92]Remember that picture I took of you?
[52:31.04]You... You know how many photos of me exist like that?
[52:38.41]Oh, no.
[52:39.35]Alright.
[52:48.29]Oh, I have to control the game now.
[52:49.55]Do I have to take a photo of her?
[52:56.23]Alright.
[52:59.07]Can I look back like GTA?
[53:02.37]Nah, she's getting close.
[53:08.78]Oh, she is like wildly flailing behind me.
[53:12.22]I'm almost out of stamina.
[53:15.24]There you go.
[53:16.86]Get to the door!
[53:19.50]GET TO THE DOOR!
[53:22.02]God damn it, man.
[53:26.07]Take a photo of her.
[53:28.89]Just make sure the lighting's correct.
[53:31.81]What do I have to do?
[53:33.03]This is like a photo shoot that I had to set up.
[53:37.19]Oh, god damn it.
[53:37.95]Gotta climb up this stupid fucking vent like every other horror video game.
[53:42.69]Hurry up, fucking watch out.
[53:44.33]Aunt Arogi's coming to get you!
[53:45.77]She's gonna grab my leg.
[53:49.45]And I'm gonna tap A.
[53:55.54]saw gonna come up saw god damn it what the hell is that thing so
[54:23.49]Rat!
[54:24.11]Saw!
[54:24.93]Rat!
[54:29.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[54:31.04]Look out!
[54:35.66]Doesn't that look like an asset that was made specifically... Look at the ground here.
[54:39.24]It's going to come behind me.
[54:46.37]I guess not.
[54:49.03]Oh, no.
[54:49.47]Rat movies cancelled.
[54:54.30]Where are these fucking hairs in my mouth coming from?
[54:56.43]Did I eat, like, a bag of hair?
[55:00.25]I will- I gotta tell you, this initial... It's like going into a cutscene for, like, the jump scares.
[55:10.74]Like, I know it's gonna come- I know it's coming.
[55:13.66]Okay.
[55:16.42]Okay.
[55:25.63]I knew I was gonna have to tap A. It's alright, we're almost out of the tutorial.
[55:39.40]See?
[55:39.72]It's all computer generated, doesn't even matter.
[55:41.56]You can be anywhere you can go, anywhere you can be anything, you can do anything.
[55:47.97]Dude, I think I dra- I must have, in my sleep, dragged my tongue on the ground.
[55:54.59]Because my health is full of hair.
[55:58.69]Like, it's crazy.
[55:59.79]I don't know where it's coming from.
[56:00.57]Am I like, is it coming from down here?
[56:04.17]It's not coming from in here.
[56:06.66]When your health is critically low, the life gauge will turn red.
[56:08.98]While the life gauge is red, it will automatically regenerate up to a certain point.
[56:12.20]It will regenerate more quickly if you stand still.
[56:14.78]So try to find a safe place to hide and recover when in a critical condition.
[56:19.43]Why is there so much hair on my ground?
[56:21.91]Those of you pet owners, it's just part of your life now.
[56:25.03]It's just a lifestyle.
[56:27.23]You got like a dog and a cat in the house, there's going to be hair in your food, there's going to be hair on the ground, there's going to be hair on your bed.
[56:32.76]Everywhere.
[56:33.48]And you can vacuum as much as you want.
[56:34.92]A week will go by and there'll be like a clump of hair in the corner of your room.
[56:38.36]It'll look like an animal.
[56:41.10]It's just a life.
[56:42.68]That's life then.
[56:44.94]Okay.
[56:48.29]Do I have a knife now?
[56:56.35]Alright, double tap, you just kick the door open.
[56:58.03]And now where am I?
[57:00.43]I don't know.
[57:01.37]I don't know where you are.
[57:04.73]First observation though, thank God they removed the cinematic mode that they tried to put in on that first game, when there was like the two black bars up and down.
[57:16.34]The origin of the medicine in these portable syringes is unknown, but they provide moderate health restoration.
[57:23.68]Hold LB and use an item from the menu.
[57:27.69]Weapons can be set to shortcuts for quick access.
[57:30.49]Hold on.
[57:39.16]Explain this to me again.
[57:41.76]Weapons can be set to shortcuts for quick access.
[57:44.11]Highlight a weapon and then use that to assign to a shortcut slot.
[57:50.61]Okay, so now I'm going to put this one up.
[57:57.43]Fuckin idea.
[57:57.83]All right.
[57:59.47]Hmm, right kick.
[58:03.55]How do I get a weapon in my hand?
[58:11.33]It's a post-it note The handwriting in this journal is neat and precise just got the call now another reason for all the weird shit That's been happening the last few days.
[58:19.92]It's the worst possible scenario, but at least I don't have to pretend anymore.
[58:23.04]Oh
[58:25.00]I don't need to read this.
[58:26.40]It's just a random file.
[58:28.46]And then, like, the fucking windows will load over there.
[58:31.22]Like, Arrow will figure it out for me.
[58:34.12]That was good.
[58:35.04]If you fucking denied that was good, I don't even... I don't respect that opinion at all.
[58:38.47]That was good.
[58:39.93]Color that fucking thing in blue.
[58:41.33]And give me the fucking A+.
[58:42.19]A gun!
[59:02.51]How to use the gun.
[59:04.25]Hold down L2 and press R2 to shoot guns.
[59:10.97]Be careful.
[59:11.89]Ammo is sparse.
[59:18.88]Why do I kick all the doors?
[59:20.40]Because this photo, I thought I was lost in the fire, but it's so beautiful.
[59:23.28]What's on the back?
[59:23.96]I love you, daddy, with a...
[59:28.44]That is two eggs and a sausage.
[59:32.25]She must have loved breakfast.
[59:35.38]What did I get myself into?
[59:38.28]Windows!
[59:39.69]Windows!
[59:43.64]I don't know.
[59:45.72]But it sure as hell wasn't a quaint little town.
[59:48.32]There's something bad happening in here, Kidman.
[59:50.81]Baker is dead.
[59:52.47]There's a killer running around in here.
[59:54.59]Doing things... This is gonna be like an Alan Wake scenario.
[59:58.27]I know it.
[59:59.23]I know it.
[59:59.81]What the fuck did you just send me into?
[60:01.73]Fuck.
[60:03.35]I don't know.
[60:04.66]We're in the dark out here.
[60:06.10]Baker was the team leader.
[60:07.68]If he's dead, that doesn't bode well for the rest of them.
[60:11.13]Keep searching around.
[60:12.03]The more info you gather, the more I'll be able to help you.
[60:15.21]Yeah.
[60:16.83]Sure.
[60:17.07]Is there loot boxes in this game?
[60:33.30]The last chance pack.
[60:38.70]I didn't download this.
[60:41.28]Burst handgun, 50 gunpowder, 100 weapon parts, 1 high-grade weapon part, 1 medical kit, 5 herbs.
[60:47.30]Alright, this automatic pistol... Hey, thanks for making the game easier for me.
[60:51.84]This automatic pistol fires 3-shot bursts and can do more damage than the standard semi-automatic handgun, even though it shares the same ammunition.
[60:58.77]This weapon was included in the Last Chance Pack!
[61:02.98]Gunpowder, an explosive mixture of potassium, nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal used in shells and cartridges.
[61:08.85]12 centuries old and just as effective.
[61:10.17]This component can be used to craft ammunition and other useful items.
[61:15.41]As well as looking like protein powder.
[61:19.47]Okay.
[61:25.54]High grade weapon parts.
[61:26.44]These components are higher quality than standard weapon parts.
[61:29.00]You had to pay for these.
[61:30.22]They can be used to unlock a weapon's upgrade potential.
[61:34.17]Weapon parts.
[61:36.77]Various useful components that can be used to upgrade weapons at a workbench.
[61:41.05]And a med kit.
[61:41.69]We all know what this does.
[61:42.49]You can craft herbs just like... Okay.

[62:15.58]The one that I got for free for getting the loot box.
[62:19.24]Where's the knife?
[62:21.80]Alright, here's the gun.
[62:23.33]That's how you aim.
[62:29.13]So you upgrade, you salvage parts and shit.

[68:27.12]I don't know what to say, that's fucking insane.
[68:29.70]Alright, let's go back to play the game.
[68:33.93]No, but that doesn't make that- I don't believe that for a second, because why was the first one like a dog hair, and that one was like a human hair?
[68:47.02]Okay.
[68:51.70]Something about that is fucking perfect live guy on Twitch live streams himself balding What a fucking world what what a world you live in You're gonna see a guy live in person bald and get the balding hairs in his mouth That's unbelievable Twitch plays balding is he dead?

[69:23.20]Damn.
[69:23.74]Alright, let's go.
[69:28.68]Swear to God, man.
[69:30.29]It's Friday the 13th.
[69:31.43]Weird shit is going on.
[69:32.71]I need to go get a drink.
[69:35.81]I'm not kidding.
[69:36.35]I gotta go get a fucking real drink.
[69:38.55]Because if I'm gonna... I'm gonna watch the fucking TV, don't I?
[69:48.36]It's always static.
[69:49.28]Of course it is.
[69:51.85]Live balding and eating nose hairs.
[69:54.13]Nose hairs are falling out of my nose and into my mouth.
[70:01.92]Let's go upstairs.
[70:02.74]It's fucking a bunch of nose hairs.
[70:14.55]This is just the... This is just Resident Evil 7.
[70:19.41]This is the upstairs to Resident Evil 7.
[70:20.81]Same, like, lady.
[70:21.61]There's a girl there, like, running around, right?
[70:32.12]What is that?
[70:34.30]Gunpowder.
[70:35.62]I need to go back to the workbench.
[70:38.94]Yeah, get Twitch Prime.
[70:39.79]Get instant access to live balding.
[70:43.49]So unnecessary.
[70:49.04]Alright, so, we'll just keep going, I guess.
[70:51.66]I don't think there's anything else in that house I need to do.
[71:00.45]You guys have instant access to it.
[71:05.14]Remember, we're in a computer world.
[71:08.20]Melee attack.
[71:09.16]RRT.
[71:09.72]Break it.
[71:12.20]I'm just kidding.
[71:15.97]Just like, oh no, another one!
[71:21.14]Okay, I actually do have a real melee attack.
[71:27.31]Let's play Outlast 2 again.
[71:28.43]I know, really.
[71:34.03]Can I not break these big ones?
[71:36.91]Well, okay.
[71:47.24]Alright.
[71:48.86]No, I want to go in the car.
[71:50.14]I want to open the car door.
[71:51.60]I don't want to roll over it.
[71:54.00]There's probably something in there.
[71:57.30]No, there's nothing in there apparently.
[71:58.84]Okay.
[71:59.44]What about the trunk?
[72:02.52]No.
[72:05.68]Let's go.
[72:07.86]How do I reload?
[72:09.30]Just like every video game.
[72:10.35]I got it.
[72:14.97]Sprinting uses stamina.
[72:18.73]20 miles per hour speed limit.
[72:20.49]Do I hear machine gun fire?
[72:24.59]I do.
[72:28.62]Maybe I should utilize the knife.
[72:29.86]Is the knife like a couple swings or what?
[72:36.50]I told you, people are playing a bunch of different video games.
[72:39.00]This is Left 4 Dead.
[72:39.97]See?
[72:43.53]See?
[72:45.99]That guy was playing Fatal Frame.
[72:47.29]We got, like, Left 4 Dead 2.
[72:48.45]We're just all inside of a video.
[72:53.95]This is just existence.
[72:55.25]Except it's... Alright, we gotta go see... We gotta go look at that guy.
[73:00.31]Oh, here.
[73:00.59]What's with the... Oh, that's like that they can see you.
[73:04.89]Okay.
[73:05.85]Ah!
[73:13.87]Stealth and sneak kills.
[73:15.77]Press R to enter sneak mode.
[73:17.93]Enemies are especially drawn to sound.
[73:20.50]Crouch movement can help you attack and away enemies from behind.
[73:23.34]Well, that's not going to happen now.
[73:27.48]Enemy alert icons.
[73:29.24]When an enemy starts to become aware of you... There's zombies!
[73:32.55]An enemy alertness icon shaped like an eye will appear at the top of the screen.
[73:35.79]When the eye becomes fully aware of you, the eye will open.
[73:39.98]When an enemy is starting to become aware of you, because of noise you're making, sound waves will appear.
[73:55.79]Well, is this guy aware?
[73:57.99]Are you aware?
[73:58.57]Oh, god damn it.
[74:03.99]Alright, we just have to train them.
[74:06.13]We just have to train them.
[74:09.47]Oh my god, just get up there.
[74:10.39]They can't climb.
[74:12.13]Bottles.
[74:12.63]No, alright.
[74:19.34]At least I can just move this.
[74:21.08]Alright, we're fine.
[74:21.72]Just get in here.
[74:24.02]Tutorial failed.
[74:24.84]Well, it took him like a fucking hour to get here.
[74:26.62]Are you kidding me?
[74:29.22]Open the door!
[74:40.42]Okay, let's... Let's do this again.
[74:43.64]I didn't know I was going to have to do this shit.
[74:48.34]Where is this person?
[74:49.13]Let's sneak kill this person.
[74:50.53]Okay, let's do the tutorial sneak kill.
[75:02.59]Enemy alertness, yeah.
[75:06.01]Give me the sneak.
[75:08.63]Dude, just like Shadow of Mordor.
[75:11.53]Shadow of monsters.
[75:15.29]Is that good?
[75:15.81]Okay, let's go.
[75:18.65]No, don't climb it.
[75:19.39]I want to use it as cover.
[75:22.15]Let's just go.
[75:22.85]Fuck it.
[75:26.49]Sneak kill an unaware enemy.
[75:28.09]Like, you mean this guy?
[75:30.28]This unaware enemy over here?
[75:32.82]I will gladly.
[75:35.96]Gladly.
[75:42.35]He's dead.
[75:45.43]Finally, we get some gosh darn gameplay, man.
[75:52.28]I think I can slowly walk.
[75:54.12]You don't have to go that crazy about it.
[75:58.76]Let's go talk to the guy.
[75:59.56]Let's go talk to the military dude in here.
[76:02.96]Take the goo.
[76:04.20]Fuck.
[76:05.28]You're right.
[76:06.66]Let's get that goo.
[76:14.33]Green gel.
[76:15.03]I can sit in wheelchairs and safe houses in other locations to upgrade skills.
[76:22.08]Is this wheelchair just sitting here I can sit in?
[76:26.98]Okay.
[76:27.26]Let's take this stuff first.
[76:31.96]Yeah, you throw bottles and they can explode.
[76:35.03]Oh no.
[76:36.39]Throwing bottles can make enough noise to distract enemies.
[76:38.87]Bottles can be equipped in the arsenal.
[76:41.40]After purchasing the bottle break skill, bottles can also be used to break out of some enemy's grab attacks.
[76:48.68]If you play on casual, you automatically get this.
[76:52.71]I only have one bottle.
[76:56.47]Okay, so let's put bottle on here.
[76:59.13]I have one of these.
[77:05.13]I don't think I need to use it right now because I only have one.
[77:07.11]So why would I use it?
[77:09.13]Don't leave this stuff here.
[77:14.74]You can't open doors, but you can break windows good to know What a random shit just lying around Let's go and then you have to shove Did you just the house exploded I
[77:41.10]Did you see that?
[77:41.77]Not only did the door come off, the fucking house was crumbling.
[77:45.35]What the fuck?
[77:49.75]Oh my god.
[77:55.04]I took the whole fucking supporting wall.
[77:59.80]Alright, where is this guy?
[78:00.88]Not in the bathtub.
[78:03.73]Restayed stuff.
[78:04.93]Got it.
[78:10.84]They're probably getting in now All right, where are you tell me all you tell me your story cutscene here?
[78:17.64]He is no don't shoot.
[78:19.32]He's gonna have the gun out pointy Don't come in here Okay, calm down.
[78:25.65]I could have wrote this game.
[78:26.75]Don't shoot don't shoot uh You're one of them aren't you no I'm not put the gun down and I'm gonna shoot him see oh
[78:36.82]This is the guy from the fucking, this is the guy from the paper.
[78:38.68]This is the guy from the photo.
[78:40.34]This guy gets shot in the head.
[78:41.34]Watch, I shoot this guy in the head.
[78:42.80]You can lower your gun.
[78:44.90]I'm on your side.
[78:45.79]Remember the picture?
[78:46.93]You're not Mobius.
[78:48.63]Yeah.
[78:50.11]You might not be one of those things, but that doesn't mean you're on my side.
[78:54.93]I have two guns.
[78:57.04]I don't work for Mobius.
[78:57.94]Yeah, dickhead, you don't know that I bought the DLC.
[79:01.10]Have you seen what those things out there?
[79:04.09]I'm telling you.
[79:04.87]This guy's dead.
[79:05.63]Don't you do that.
[79:06.95]He's dead.
[79:07.45]Oh.
[79:08.67]Oh, I see.
[79:09.07]You bought it too.
[79:33.99]I know, I'm just a paintballer.
[79:35.33]I like to go paintballing every other weekend.
[79:43.41]He takes the gun and shoots me.
[80:05.13]I'm O'Neil.
[80:06.96]Yeah.
[80:07.50]He's the guy from the photo.
[80:08.60]Liam O'Neil.
[80:10.66]Liam O'Neeson.
[80:11.58]So you're not Mobius, but they sent you in here?
[80:15.42]Why?
[80:15.66]You're not going to give me... I'm looking for my... I'm trying to restore the core.
[80:21.49]Just like you are.
[80:22.27]Don't give me the dialogue options.
[80:23.91]Good luck with that.
[80:25.21]I'm done.
[80:26.03]I'm just going to hold out here until extraction.
[80:28.32]They can't extract you.
[80:30.60]Not until Lily is found.
[80:32.30]Who's Lily?
[80:33.00]It's going to be like angry, happy, constructive.
[80:36.28]Until the core is located.
[80:38.96]Can you help me out?
[80:40.24]If you're asking me to go out there with you, you can forget about it.
[80:43.75]This is a safe house.
[80:44.97]Morbius.
[80:45.79]Morpheus.
[80:47.21]But I may have a lead on the core.
[80:49.13]I detected some signals nearby that resonate at the core's frequency.
[80:52.53]Oh, I have one of those.
[80:53.36]Thanks, man.
[80:53.80]Here, listen to this.
[81:00.81]It sounds like a bird, doesn't it?
[81:02.23]I have birds, too!
[81:03.39]That sounds like... That sounds like a fancy canoe.
[81:09.66]Could be a cockatoo.
[81:11.64]Was that her?
[81:13.54]Fucking terrible joke.
[81:35.53]It's the only way we're getting out of here.
[81:37.57]Suit yourself.
[81:38.87]Let's pair up our communicators.
[81:40.93]That way I can tell you if I find anything.
[81:42.40]Are we synchronizing watches?
[81:43.52]Okay.
[81:44.54]Can't hurt, I guess.
[81:45.76]Let's synchronize watches.
[81:48.84]Chapter three.
[81:50.60]Oh, God damn it.
[81:51.56]Don't give me dialogue options.
[81:53.94]It's more dangerous out there than I expect.
[81:55.58]This isn't Mass Effect.
[81:58.55]I tried to tell you about this one signal, but you didn't want to hear it.
[82:02.79]Well, I'm all ears now.
[82:04.71]I picked something up from two Mobius security team members.
[82:07.07]Maybe you can follow it and get some gear.
[82:09.03]Maybe they're out there, can help you out.
[82:10.86]I'll think about it.
[82:12.24]Come on, man.
[82:13.12]I'm all alone in here.
[82:14.08]I could use some protection.
[82:15.74]Maybe if you hadn't let your last guard take the fall for you.
[82:18.84]Whatever.
[82:20.29]I'll mark the signal on your communicator.
[82:21.71]Oh, we gotta have side quest.
[82:22.51]Follow it or don't follow it.
[82:24.21]I don't... Every one of these is gonna lead to, like, another... There were five.
[82:31.59]There was a sheriff I found.
[82:33.24]I told him he wouldn't always have you ask me.
[82:34.90]Yeah.
[82:35.28]Tomato?
[82:36.14]I'll let you know.
[82:36.66]You'd really... Thanks.
[82:38.39]Okay.
[82:39.45]Investigate the Mobius, the residents.
[82:42.69]Those things are pretty tough.
[82:43.76]Do you have anything stronger?
[82:45.00]Not in here.
[82:45.68]This place was designed to be peaceful.
[82:47.32]Do you know where I can find some of this firepower?
[82:49.36]It's pretty chaotic out there.
[82:50.69]But I did see something useful next to an abandoned APC just outside.
[82:54.09]I'll mark its location for you.
[82:55.96]That's all I needed to know.
[82:57.18]That's all I needed.
[82:58.55]I heard the whole story there.
[83:00.29]I was very tactical about when I skipped.
[83:02.61]Let's do that again.
[83:03.15]Okay.
[83:03.65]We're good.
[83:03.93]Tactical conversation.
[83:26.04]coffee drinking coffee at a coffee maker will restore you to full health coffee makers will automatically begin brewing another pot after use but the process will take some time to complete okay let's take let's drink some coffee now drink it right out drink it right out of the spout don't pour it in there don't you know how to drink coffee and he drinks it black just like me
[83:56.40]It's not like fucking... Booze.
[84:00.74]It's not like fucking crack.
[84:03.14]Workbenches.
[84:03.77]Workbenches can be used to craft ammunition and items with components and to upgrade weapons.
[84:08.11]Just like that game Dead Island you used to like.
[84:10.03]Uh-huh.
[84:13.19]Except that game was pretty... Six out of ten at best.
[84:19.43]Alright, crafting.
[84:20.57]Let's see what we can do.
[84:21.43]Handgun bullets.
[84:24.17]It's two gunpowder for that.
[84:26.19]I have a lot.
[84:29.81]I have a lot of these.
[84:30.69]Let's get like ten.
[84:36.43]Is there any reason why I wouldn't just make all of them?
[84:41.47]Let's make them all.
[84:46.49]Let's make a medical syringe or two or three.
[84:51.91]Yeah, I'm gonna... The syringes are fine.
[84:53.75]I don't need to make a medkit right now.
[84:57.31]Okay, 20 out of 20.
[84:59.48]Weapon upgrades.
[85:01.54]Handgun, ammo capacity, firepower, reload time.
[85:07.16]Ammo capacity.
[85:08.96]It is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[85:14.68]Where's my DLC gun?
[85:15.64]I don't think it matters.
[85:19.46]Alright, do I want to, like...
[85:21.69]Upgrade my... Let's do ammo capacity.
[85:25.05]Just get it to seven.
[85:33.40]And... We need some more damage here.
[85:37.08]Right?
[85:37.50]Yeah.
[85:39.02]I'm missing the following components.
[85:40.22]Fuck.
[85:51.92]That's all right for now.
[85:54.47]Field crafting.
[85:56.49]What do I think so far?
[85:57.59]I think it's Mass Effect 3 presents... Mass Effect 3 presents Resident Evil 7, but the game was made 10 years ago and Dead Island, like... Dead Island, like, was involved inside of that, like, vat of goo that everyone contributed to to make this game.
[86:22.44]Sorry.
[86:24.68]Select the field crafting tool from the arsenal menu and craft items using a workbench.
[86:28.36]Without using a workbench, yeah.
[86:29.82]Gotta consume more resources when you craft on the field.
[86:35.04]Okay.
[86:42.36]I just made a bunch of bullets.
[86:43.25]Why would you do that?
[86:44.65]This bullet's just sitting on the counter and I just crafted a bunch of them.
[86:49.01]This is your fucking fault.
[86:52.68]Can't even aim in here.
[86:54.78]Fucking open world my ass.
[86:56.12]Alright, let's go.
[86:57.28]Let's do the mission.
[86:58.54]Save it.
[87:02.90]The last of us?
[87:06.62]Yeah, it looks like the last of us guy.
[87:08.79]Alright, let me... Let's make this interesting, guys.
[87:17.49]And by interesting, now I actually can upgrade the pistol.
[87:21.33]So let me do that first.
[87:24.88]Might as well just do firepower.
[87:26.06]It was 100, right?
[87:27.90]90.
[87:30.86]Okay.
[87:31.08]I'm going to get a drink.
[87:33.36]Because I need a drink right now.
[87:36.48]Give me two minutes.
[87:37.41]I'll be right back.
[87:38.25]We're finally into the game now.
[87:40.01]After an hour plus.
[87:42.29]Give me one minute.
[87:43.41]Two minutes.
[87:43.85]Three minutes.
[87:44.39]I'll see you in a minute.
[91:16.72]I knew ah You know I never mind it's already over it's fucking ruined who cares let's just play I Was saying you know when you guys come back from a stream and you look like you know, but you guys like yeah I'm like what?
[91:33.97]Who cares Sweat check
[91:43.61]I should change the title.
[91:45.59]Play something else.
[91:47.05]No, we haven't even, we just got started.
[91:48.99]This game was 60 bucks.
[91:52.66]I don't want to just like spend 20 minutes in a $60 game and be like, I'm done.
[91:57.14]All right, let's go.
[92:03.22]So, uh, thank you to all the bits.
[92:06.77]Thank you, Upward Fern for the $5.
[92:07.91]Hey, Jeremiah, it's me again.
[92:12.12]Oh, my God.
[92:13.16]All right.
[92:13.52]We lost total track.
[92:15.58]You never said what you were going to say about the job thing.
[92:19.44]Upward Friend, thank you.
[92:20.44]Thank you for the $5, first of all, and your previous donation as well.
[92:25.11]I'm not going to refund it, by the way.
[92:27.63]So you're 20 years old.
[92:30.15]I would say it depends on how... So if you're making money from your father's job, if your father has you brought into a company or something, you just need to determine if...
[92:42.35]If long term, you want to like work under your father, you know what I mean?
[92:47.11]Because you're 20 years old now.
[92:48.17]And if you think about it, you have a lot of time to figure out exactly what you want to do.
[92:54.63]So I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[92:57.19]I didn't know what I was going to do for like jobs or career or anything like that.
[93:01.17]It took me till I was like in my mid to late 20s before I like fell into something that I actually knew I wanted to do.
[93:07.07]So I would say stick with it for now.
[93:10.47]Unless you, if you look, if you don't like it, if you don't like it, then obviously you want to, you want to do what makes you happy.
[93:16.97]You know what I mean?
[93:17.39]If like going to work for your father every day is like fucking sucks, then maybe you need to do a change.
[93:24.44]Maybe you need to try something else.
[93:26.20]But you have a lot of time.
[93:29.02]Don't feel like you need to make some hasty decision because holy shit, I'm 20 years old.
[93:33.03]I'm running out of time.
[93:36.34]You got at least a decade before you need to figure that out.
[93:39.82]Trust me on that.
[93:42.79]That's the exact situation that you're into.
[93:44.33]I wish I could speak to you from experience, but I don't have any.
[93:52.33]I mean, I could... No, not really.
[93:56.78]I don't have that kind of... I worked for my parents or something.
[94:01.14]My parents owned a company and I worked for it.
[94:03.42]I can imagine that's kind of a different scenario.
[94:05.37]I wish I could give you a better, more informed opinion on that and be able to relate to it.
[94:13.17]You're about to backseat game me so hard, Italics.
[94:15.77]Well, sorry, that's a bannable offense.
[94:18.45]That's a mod-removable offense.
[94:21.77]Alright, when the communicator is within scanning range of a residence point, a waveform will appear on the upper left side of the screen.
[94:27.53]Move the communicator around to find the signal and lock onto it.
[94:34.56]When locked on the communicator will show the direction in the relative distance to the locked on point Okay, so Track down the source of the girl's voice using your communicator Yeah, pull up pull up your fucking talk boy from the 80s Wait, what did this game take place in what 1976?
[95:01.91]Holy shit, this game takes place in 1776?
[95:03.07]Cheers to that.
[95:15.64]Ah, shit.
[95:18.26]We got ourselves a chunk error!
[95:20.14]What the hell?
[95:25.34]The rain cats me!
[95:29.18]What the fuck is happening?
[95:32.01]Alright, how do I pull up the communication device?
[95:42.81]How do I pull it up?
[95:45.75]Where's the communicator?
[95:47.80]It's right there.
[95:48.52]How do I pull up the communicator?
[95:56.86]Where's the communicator?
[95:58.92]And what is this thing?
[96:00.36]Is this a person?
[96:01.18]Is this like a mini person sitting here?
[96:02.78]I have to destroy these, and it's like, we destroy one, like, destroy one resonant, resonance, re... Renaissance statue.
[96:10.93]I'm just gonna shoot it and get it and see if that's a... Take it!
[96:25.53]Fuck, I didn't want to jump over that.
[96:28.64]It's English.
[96:30.39]I know.
[96:30.73]And I shot like four guns.
[96:34.97]I shot four of guns.
[96:41.03]Locker keys are good.
[96:42.02]Good.
[96:44.28]Alright.
[96:45.24]Is my device just blinking?
[96:47.78]Is this like a... I don't understand.
[96:49.18]I think I'm in the right place.
[96:51.62]No.
[96:51.84]I don't want to go to this fucking destination wedding.
[96:53.59]Get the fuck out of here.
[96:58.68]Alright, I'm going to go eat dinner.
[96:59.64]When I get back, you better be having fun.
[97:03.07]Don't tell me how to act.
[97:08.07]If I'm not having fun taking pictures of fucking doggos, then I'm not having fun.
[97:14.79]Or turkeys.
[97:23.39]Take it open.
[97:23.85]Come on, open the door.
[97:24.51]God damn it.
[97:29.00]Locker key, mm-hmm, what's in there?
[97:32.66]Nothing.
[97:43.00]How do I pull up the fucking communicator?
[97:45.50]Where do I get my fucking ghost tracking ecto thing?
[97:48.30]That's one of my favorite movies, Harold Ramis.
[97:52.38]One of my favorite movies of all time, come on, Egon!
[97:55.59]The paranormal detector.
[97:56.81]The thing that has the two ears that pop up and it goes... Where is it?
[98:00.94]How do I get it?
[98:05.62]Because I think I'm in the right place.
[98:08.16]Why?
[98:08.48]Okay, good.
[98:11.00]Okay, lock on that.
[98:21.45]Okay, I got it.
[98:23.65]Y. But Y is not Y for me.
[98:26.17]Y is triangle.
[98:31.71]Let me open up this guy's fucking gym bag and take his protein powder.
[98:34.57]That's right.
[98:36.13]I'm going to make that reference again.
[98:37.53]Don't you dare try to silence me.
[98:43.57]Too many of them.
[98:46.37]Alright.
[98:46.61]They're going this way.
[98:50.23]Too many of them.
[98:59.20]I'm just playing Simon Says at this point.
[99:06.54]There's too many of them.
[99:08.58]Watch out!
[99:09.64]Back off.
[99:11.47]Alright, which one?
[99:12.17]In order, I have to do that.
[99:19.99]How many times do I have to say that?
[99:21.31]Yeah, I don't know.
[99:22.09]Found it.
[99:22.41]I'm taking your plant too.
[99:29.40]no apparently apparently we're not quite there yet but wait why did it like blinked when I got suck it up hold on there's too many of them there's too many of them
[100:00.58]Okay, so we found the fact that somebody has a speak and say.
[100:07.09]That we're... Alright, put it down.
[100:09.13]You understand what I'm trying to say here.
[100:11.19]Can I go in any of these buildings?
[100:19.19]This plan is flawed.
[100:20.49]Retreat.
[100:22.28]There's just too many of them.
[100:27.56]They might have seen me.
[100:31.32]This is the witch.
[100:32.00]We have a knife.
[100:36.34]I want to like restart the whole game right now.
[100:38.41]Because like I... So I have 20 bullets and I shot almost all of them into that person and they didn't die.
[100:58.37]That really was the fucking witch.
[101:01.14]And that's, ladies and gentlemen, why we don't use the fucking DLC gun.
[101:17.59]I don't want the first hand gun.
[101:26.11]And I have no aim assist.
[101:27.89]I have no fucking aim assist on a console game.
[101:30.85]Like, on a console controller.
[101:33.48]That was mistake number two.
[101:39.26]I have to stealth kill people because you could just unload bullets into somebody and it doesn't even matter.
[101:43.26]Just steal the fucking goddamn vitamins from your back.
[101:47.51]From your fucking car.
[101:53.18]use the mouse please I would I just don't I don't like walking around in a third person game with the mouse and keyboard it's more comfortable like this I'll get used to it don't worry press q for the vat system now do I have to like distract you with a bottle all right go get distracted
[102:34.61]Why what the fuck you swung at nothing I
[103:22.67]There's so many things I want to say right now, but I'm gonna hold off.
[103:28.51]Oh man, there's a thousand things.
[103:30.53]I just want to scream awful things about this game.
[103:35.22]Just hold off, though.
[103:36.08]Hold off.
[103:36.58]Not yet.
[103:36.98]There's so many things I would just love to yell out loud.
[103:51.83]It'll be... Dude, it'll be more interesting than watching it.
[103:53.97]Probably.
[103:55.53]You know why?
[103:55.99]Because the... This fucking game is... It's one fucking zombie.
[104:05.35]Oh.
[104:05.51]Okay.
[104:09.63]I'm just...
[104:22.95]You just hear me apparently.
[104:35.37]Do you see me?
[104:36.01]Does it see me?
[104:37.35]Does it actually see me or what?
[104:41.97]How am I supposed to sneak up behind somebody that is doing this?
[104:47.03]How am I supposed to get a stealth kill on this fucking stupid enemy?
[104:50.98]I have to shoot it, like, in the head.
[104:54.61]The game was so desperate teaching me how to stealth kill enemies.
[104:57.89]Look at... I didn't even... You see how many fucking... What are you... What?
[105:06.95]What?
[105:07.71]Is this enemy, like, not killable in the beginning of the fucking game?
[105:11.29]Okay, I got a pouch.
[105:13.77]She's got shot six fucking times.
[105:24.22]That lady got shot nine times with a gun.
[105:28.99]That bitch took nine bullets.
[105:31.97]And like seven of them were in the head.
[105:39.47]I don't think I'm supposed to shoot this person.
[105:49.13]I gotta be more sneaky about it.
[105:51.19]Am I doing something just wrong?
[105:56.78]Harder than Dark Souls.
[105:58.28]No, it's just like, I don't understand.
[105:59.86]I know you can stealth kill enemies, but you can't sneak up behind this person.
[106:09.54]There's just one random fucking super zombie standing there.
[106:17.28]I'm going to be real, though.
[106:18.62]Literally, I upgraded the pistol twice.
[106:22.65]I shot that person nine times, and they're still alive.
[106:28.77]I'm just saying.
[106:30.35]I'm just making an observation.
[106:33.53]She got shot nine fucking times with a pistol.
[106:36.05]And, like, at least four of those that are in the head.
[106:39.65]I gotta invest more points in... I gotta invest more points in Bitcoin.
[106:48.65]What the hell is that?
[106:53.40]Maybe she weren't a fat-rolling loser.
[107:01.00]God.
[107:01.36]That guy's holding a fucking explosive, too.
[107:05.25]Now I'm, like, afraid.
[107:06.59]Now I'm, like, actually afraid to shoot enemies.
[107:12.97]And now we're just, like, running.
[107:18.19]Now I've got a train of zombies behind me.
[107:23.41]What is that?
[107:24.65]What the fuck is that thing?
[107:26.62]What is this layout?
[107:27.84]What the fuck is this game's layout?
[107:30.18]What the fuck is this game?
[107:35.83]This is not like the first one.
[107:41.51]You have to go run around and randomly examine... Alright, let me see something.
[108:00.78]Holy fucking shit, dude.
[108:08.46]And I have the burst gun on.
[108:18.09]I have to be missing something here, because this is terrible.
[108:20.97]Like, am I missing something?
[108:23.41]I have to be missing something.
[108:30.35]I have to be.
[108:31.31]Like, there's no way I'm missing this.
[108:32.89]I have to be missing this.
[108:37.89]Where the fuck even am I?
[108:39.33]I have no, like, I have no point of reference right now.
[108:54.02]Like, where the fuck even am I?
[108:55.12]322 Cedar Avenue, apparently.
[109:00.81]Do I have, like, a map?
[109:02.25]Or I just have to walk around this fucking neighborhood?
[109:04.25]Okay, I do have a map.
[109:08.29]So, you don't attack enemies in this game.
[109:11.76]Do not.
[109:12.70]If you're gonna shoot an enemy, don't do it.
[109:14.50]It takes a whole entire... It takes, like, 20 shots to kill an enemy.
[109:18.56]So just don't do it.
[109:19.90]Okay, I get it.
[109:20.58]I understand.
[109:25.16]I have full stims.
[109:30.66]I'm gonna fucking dog food.
[109:34.54]Go kill Ugg.
[109:37.62]Uh, I could be used to craft items.
[109:41.58]Alright, so I learned very quickly that fighting enemies is a huge do-no-no.
[109:48.26]Don't fucking shoot anyone.
[109:51.67]This guy's gonna get up, isn't he?
[109:59.21]I gotta stop playing it like Resident Evil.
[110:02.83]Or the first game.
[110:13.68]Now I'm just fucking terrified.
[110:15.50]I'm terrified not in the I'm scared way, but in the I'm playing like PUBG right now.
[110:21.29]And I'm gonna turn the corner and die by somebody.
[110:26.08]fuse, used to craft items.
[110:29.51]Don't tell me this is just fucking open world, like, crafting game.
[110:32.23]I gotta go chop some fucking trees down.
[110:47.37]What the hell is this?
[110:52.11]Nice, like, pretty good water tank, but whatever.
[110:56.70]Hold... Go to the Marrow Armory.
[111:04.95]Wait, am I... Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[111:08.45]I'm still, like, tapped into the Matrix.
[111:12.17]What is...
[111:23.64]What?! !
[111:26.23]What is this- what is this trying to do?
[111:28.31]Like go to the- like touch these things?
[111:40.50]What does this game want to be?
[111:41.66]Does this game want to be a survival horror game or like a matrix like mind fuck game?
[111:57.97]It wants to be your friend.
[112:01.45]It wants to be every game.
[112:03.49]So wait, I just came here for, like, no reason?
[112:05.91]Or what?
[112:10.71]Why do you think the first trailer was nothing but CG?
[112:16.17]I mean, I don't want to say anything yet.
[112:18.49]Because, like, I gotta learn... The game wants to be this specific thing.
[112:22.67]Wait, didn't I just do this?
[112:29.72]I thought I just asked to do this.
[112:35.20]What the hell is going on?
[112:41.86]I'm in a different place now.
[112:47.61]Okay.
[112:48.71]I'm in a different zone.
[112:54.09]I do say that.
[112:54.79]That is very funny when that happens.
[113:01.57]Okay.
[113:04.47]I can't kill the witch because I'm on hard mode.
[113:07.04]Go to Union 30, like, but wait a minute.
[113:08.90]Like, what is the purpose of this?
[113:10.24]Do I have to open the door?
[113:13.64]Where the fuck am I?
[113:14.84]Why am I here?
[113:23.56]I opened up somebody's, like, bomb shelter and ended up, like, in some warehouse.
[113:27.03]I went into a different game.
[113:29.61]I went into a different computer game.
[113:33.29]That's all this is.
[113:33.89]This is some guy bored on Steam opening different games.
[113:38.20]That's the whole game.
[113:39.92]Well, the game just saved right here, so who knows what the hell's behind this door.
[114:04.95]If I, like, step on any of these potato chip bags, the game actually... She'll hear me.
[114:11.16]But what is... What the fuck was that?
[114:13.36]What are you... What is that?
[114:14.18]What was that?
[114:16.94]It's hard enough to fight one enemy in this game, let alone, like, more than one.
[114:25.66]Where are you going now?
[114:29.00]She's gonna turn.
[114:29.60]This... Somebody else is walking around.
[114:34.86]Did you hear that?
[114:42.26]What is that field of vision?
[114:43.94]That's what I don't understand.
[114:44.98]Well, obviously she's not going to move from this spot.
[114:57.85]Got it.
[115:46.14]Stealth Kill.
[115:51.36]The game where a stealth kill is not a stealth kill.
[115:55.45]Not even close, actually.
[115:57.03]I did it, apparently.
[116:16.16]in my life if I imagined that a stealth... We're gonna... Ooh, a pipe!
[116:33.01]Hold on, let me explore.
[116:41.84]I came across a tougher enemy first.
[116:44.49]Well, that's not what I'm saying.
[116:46.20]I'm saying like when the game tells me I'm going to do a stealth kill on something.
[116:52.76]And it doesn't stealth kill them.
[116:57.02]That's when I have an issue.
[117:06.06]That's alright.
[117:06.94]And maybe it's just a difficulty thing.
[117:09.72]Like they wanted to make it harder.
[117:11.62]I'm fine.
[117:12.34]Now I know.
[117:13.65]Now I understand.
[117:14.37]I do want to explore something else, though.
[117:17.35]I want to see... Just make sure I didn't miss anything.
[117:25.34]The same thing happens in Shadow of War, but you didn't complain about it then.
[117:27.74]But... No way did it tell me that this was like a champion boss.
[117:33.10]Like, this is like... Oh, but be careful, babe.
[117:34.82]Watch out for the champions.
[117:37.32]That just looks like a regular default fucking shitty enemy.
[117:41.76]Apparently it hasn't been the whole time.
[117:46.79]It's alright, I got my revenge.
[117:48.27]Let's go.
[117:53.55]Well, they're doing a really good job with the fact that it is like survival horror.
[118:00.43]Look, I told you, I have to hold my tongue here.
[118:03.09]I do.
[118:03.33]Because this game is pretty cool.
[118:08.16]Hold my tongue.
[118:10.10]Like, grab it.
[118:26.50]Alright, sneak up behind him, but make sure I don't want to miss anything.
[118:28.98]No trash.
[118:30.50]Is that guy dead?
[118:32.64]This guy's ponytail is moving around.
[118:34.14]This guy's not dead, is he?
[118:46.44]What the fuck?!
[118:51.00]The other one's gonna be behind me.
[118:54.64]Why are you still moving?! !
[119:07.01]I have to play with keyboard and mouse.
[119:11.26]This game is a physical impossibility without playing keyboard and mouse.
[119:17.68]This stupid... Don't say it.
[119:19.48]Shut up.
[119:20.26]I have to play keyboard and mouse.
[119:24.46]You can't play this game with a controller unless you're playing it on PlayStation fucking 2.
[119:27.94]Whatever the fuck it is.
[119:28.67]How do you crouch?
[119:30.76]Alright, that's how you pick items.
[119:32.80]Scroll wheel.
[119:33.88]Right.
[119:34.28]Okay, but how do you crouch?
[119:35.50]Control, right?
[119:36.40]Alright, let's go.
[119:44.69]So was Italics making a joke when he said, like, I'm gonna come back and hope you're having fun?
[119:49.79]That was his joke, right?
[119:51.19]Because he didn't think it was fun.
[119:54.83]That was his joke.
[119:55.41]I get it.
[119:56.11]I get your joke now, Italics.
[119:57.17]If you're watching, I understand it.
[119:59.33]This person's gonna get up.
[120:04.21]What's the... This person's gonna stand up.
[120:05.99]Like, I've never played a fucking game like this before in my life.
[120:14.57]F is sneak kill.
[120:15.63]That person's still not... So they're not gonna get up.
[120:24.86]Just gotta get used to the controls here.
[120:26.12]I don't know what the fuck opens what.
[120:30.48]Mod italics.
[120:35.37]Still not up.
[120:36.25]Why was that person even there in the first place?
[120:38.55]Got a couple of scanners.
[120:43.62]Broken fuse box can be powered momentarily by firing a shock bolt from the warden crossbow.
[120:50.56]I don't have the warden crossbow.
[120:56.58]Use W-A-S-S to do height and weight.
[120:59.84]You gotta get the right height and weight.
[121:00.88]Okay.
[121:01.22]Okay.
[121:08.02]played with that I've not I've seen it before don't worry what about the fuse I thought I I can't can I we'll see there's a gun over here though it's just ammo what warden uses a crossbow
[121:37.77]I know, right?
[121:38.39]What, like, fucking prison warden has a crossbow?
[121:43.73]Hey, a gun!
[121:44.46]Nice.
[121:49.22]I'll take it.
[121:50.56]I will take it.
[121:51.46]You are right.
[121:54.40]So how... Okay, I can put it on... No.
[122:02.83]Right there.
[122:03.27]Let's put this on just two, whatever.
[122:08.24]And there's something else in here, too.
[122:11.92]Maybe I'll be able to hit... No, not with mouse and keyboard, I'll be fine.
[122:18.37]Shotgun shots.
[122:19.63]Okay.
[122:20.77]I'm not gonna use this, though.
[122:21.65]I can only have three bullets in here?
[122:22.97]Doesn't make any sense.
[122:24.27]It's always four.
[122:26.11]What the fuck, Rocksteady?
[122:28.54]It's always four.
[122:29.40]Does this do anything?
[122:36.60]No.
[122:38.05]I think I got it.
[122:38.67]I think I got what I needed here.
[122:40.19]I think that was the point of coming in here.
[122:47.52]I'm going to walk by that zombie now.
[122:49.08]It's going to trigger her little event where she grabs you.
[122:52.70]Can this be opened?
[122:53.72]No, that's just a slab.
[122:54.70]And I can't do anything with that.
[122:58.74]Okay.
[123:01.04]I needed aim assist for the controller.
[123:03.12]I know I did.
[123:04.66]She stands up.
[123:08.72]I gotta fuck with the sensitivity, though.
[123:09.94]It's a little... Nah, the sensitivity is not doing it for me.
[123:15.46]This is so fucked up.
[123:16.38]This is why I needed to do this in the very beginning.
[123:18.47]Fucking controller, man.
[123:20.07]Honest to God.
[123:23.59]Stupid fucking dumbass controller shit.
[123:25.67]Like, I'm so angry right now.
[123:27.01]And the person's not even dead.
[123:30.57]There's like raw... There's like fucking some weird input here.
[123:34.36]Like, this is... Oh my God.
[123:36.00]Fuck this goddamn dog shit.
[123:38.95]Where is it?
[123:39.37]This needs to go way fucking down.
[123:55.80]Like, it's crazy far down.
[124:04.22]It's a little better.
[124:04.86]I'm getting upset.
[124:10.01]I am getting upset.
[124:12.59]I'm glad you've noticed.
[124:17.91]Why you gotta be so sensitivity?
[124:21.71]Now the whole place, how do I turn my flashlight?
[124:24.04]That's another important thing to know on, is it G?
[124:27.90]No, G is the device.
[124:30.94]What is flashlight?
[124:31.88]Something stupid like T, Y, U, B, V, V. V for flashlight.
[124:41.30]And F. F for... Finteract with object.
[124:50.69]Nah, let's get out of here.
[124:59.62]This is not good.
[125:00.74]Fucking V for flashlight.
[125:20.83]I want their gel.
[125:28.72]He's not dead.
[125:29.38]Like, no, he is dead.
[125:31.18]Whatever.
[125:32.86]Quick, summon bruise!
[125:37.23]What about the elevator that they just came in?
[125:42.57]Anything in here?
[125:45.21]Yeah, one of these.
[125:48.35]I don't need to shoot those.
[125:49.17]I can easily just fucking slash them with a knife.
[125:55.41]I still got it.
[125:56.09]No, I don't still got it.
[125:57.96]I need to have like a drink, man.
[125:59.08]I'm getting a little too upset.
[126:05.02]By the way, if you're curious at what I'm drinking, let me just get some of the sediment.
[126:09.51]Let me just get some of the sediment at the bottom there.
[126:16.90]Okay, there we go.
[126:18.12]It's Traveler's Grapefruit Shandy.
[126:20.60]I just have some left over.
[126:22.72]Kim got it.
[126:23.84]And there's some just still in the house, so.
[126:33.08]Sponsored stream.
[126:35.89]Oh, I got a shit in the bedpan.
[126:37.49]Gotta stop making jokes again.
[126:39.31]I got too angry at, like, how hard this game apparently turned into be.
[126:43.37]And now I'm just, like, I'm just, like, stiff.
[126:48.21]Gotta get this, like, stiffness out of me.
[126:54.19]Oh, I got the shotgun.
[126:59.17]I just have to come to terms with what this game wants to be.
[127:02.77]I still don't know it yet.
[127:05.20]We'll figure it out.
[127:07.08]Because, like I said, this is a triple-A, triple-A big league release.
[127:16.25]Radio video, thanks for the $5.
[127:17.61]Quick tip, the game is produced by the original director of Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 4, Dino Crisis, and God Hand.
[127:27.18]God Hand?
[127:29.40]Thank you for the $5 radio video.
[127:32.84]So yes, I gotta take it slow.
[127:35.06]This is not a shoot game.
[127:36.70]This is not a fucking Resident Evil 7 game.
[127:39.52]Resident Evil 6.
[127:41.96]But thank you.
[127:43.86]Also, thank you, DJ.
[127:46.34]Thank you, DJ Emberman, for the five bucks.
[127:48.38]I've been having a pretty rough day today, so I'm glad I was able to catch you streaming tonight.
[127:52.38]You've always been able to make me laugh, and I've got to thank you for that.
[127:55.32]DJ Emberman.
[127:56.70]Well, thank you for the five dollars, DJ.
[127:58.77]DJ Emberman.
[127:59.99]However you pronounce your name.
[128:00.87]Thank you.
[128:02.19]Lieutenant Pyro Tech, thanks for the five bucks.
[128:04.35]Coffee, Cheetos, and a certain cooked poultry.
[128:08.27]Thank you for the five dollars.
[128:11.07]Thank you guys a lot.
[128:12.13]So much.
[128:14.72]You can hear that.
[128:15.56]Why does it have to... Why do I have to do this twice?
[128:17.26]I can't... I... I don't... Can't I just... Is this like a glorified loading screen?
[128:23.84]Is that what this is?
[128:27.39]Thanks for making sure to keep giving the game a chance even though you're frustrated.
[128:29.55]No, I... Like I said, I... I... I don't... I don't want to like jump... jump to like anger... anger... bad, mean, angry conclusions because it's... it's... it's good.
[128:38.96]It's... it's... I'm not ready to make a judgment yet.
[128:43.06]I thought this was a different kind.
[128:44.54]I thought this was a different game.
[128:46.26]I thought this was like a shoot zombie in head, die, keep going, collect items, play the story.
[128:51.23]This is like actually a walk around like a neighborhood and survive.
[128:56.93]And you don't kill things easily.
[128:58.25]I did not know that.
[129:00.86]I'm playing the game like Resident Evil 5 or Resident Evil like 4.
[129:05.48]And I kind of shouldn't be.
[129:09.40]It's actually a survival horror game.
[129:11.91]I thought it was just going to be like jump scare night.
[129:13.75]You know what I mean?
[129:14.21]We're like, oh, you shoot some zombies and then boo.
[129:17.15]No, there's like no jump scares.
[129:21.90]It's more actually don't die.
[129:24.48]The jump scares are almost a zero.
[129:26.78]I say that, right?
[129:38.19]Oh, fuck, man.
[129:43.57]I gotta, like, sneak out the back door.
[129:51.03]What's, what is, uh, cover?
[129:52.11]I don't know what cover is.
[129:56.49]This is a fucking fire axe.
[129:58.59]What is cover?
[129:59.95]God fucking damn it, I bumped into the wall.
[130:01.99]I don't know what cover is on the fucking keyboard because I didn't use it.
[130:08.36]C?
[130:10.62]Spacebar?
[130:11.98]Control?
[130:12.34]No, Control is crouch and stand.
[130:35.31]Can I- do I get the axe?
[130:37.21]He's not dead, is he?
[130:39.05]Yeah, he is.
[130:39.31]I actually do get the fire axe.
[130:44.97]When acquired, a hand axe temporarily replaces the survival knife in combat.
[130:47.91]It can instantly kill some enemies, but will break after a single use.
[130:53.32]Okay.
[130:53.84]Can be found around a union enemy.
[130:58.52]You had to fucking puke!
[131:01.10]Oh my god.
[131:02.02]It's not-
[131:03.86]I'm telling you, something weird is going on with this fucking input.
[131:07.12]I have like a quarter of a second input delay.
[131:11.26]I swear to God, guys.
[131:12.68]Like, I swear to God, this is not what's happening right now.
[131:21.35]I swear to God, it's like this weird, like, move, move.
[131:24.45]Move, move.
[131:25.09]Move, move.
[131:25.51]Is there like raw fucking input data on this game?
[131:27.23]Is there something I can disable?
[131:28.51]Do they have like fucking mouse smoothing in this game?
[131:30.43]I swear to God.
[131:32.47]Because I'm going like move, move, move, move, move, move.
[131:35.11]It's like a quarter of a second input delay.
[131:37.49]Why?
[131:39.31]Why?
[131:39.55]I don't have vertical sync turned on.
[131:42.81]Oh, I'm so fucking angry about this.
[131:44.51]Why?
[131:47.05]V-sync isn't turned on.
[131:50.57]I turned it off.
[131:53.92]What is causing this?
[131:55.18]Because whatever it is, get the fuck away from me.
[131:56.78]Please, God.
[132:25.22]I'm almost better off using the fucking controller right now.
[132:35.07]I'm all the way back here.
[132:35.83]Like... Am I actually all the fucking way... No.
[132:39.87]No.
[132:40.19]Wait a minute.
[132:41.33]I have the shotgun, right?
[132:42.17]Okay, I was gonna say.
[132:42.81]What the fuck?
[132:45.80]Turn on full screen, not borderless.
[132:49.98]Is that what's... Is that what's going on?
[132:55.92]I'll try it.
[133:02.72]Like, let's do it.
[133:05.99]Fullscreen.
[133:07.37]Like, how do I just, like, do it?
[133:10.57]I don't... I don't think that did it.
[133:14.31]Did it?
[133:20.40]Actually, hold on.
[133:27.15]Uhhh... I don't feel that much of a difference.
[133:32.56]Whatever.
[133:46.34]Why would you fall screen?
[133:48.52]Well, I don't know.
[133:49.50]I'm willing to try anything.
[133:50.84]It's weird.
[133:57.77]I might actually need to turn the sensitivity up.
[134:02.99]What do you mean it's a feature?
[134:06.71]It's a pretty fucking dumb feature.
[134:10.66]Wait, I got... There's bullets I didn't get right.
[134:19.26]Yeah, I'm not talking... I'm talking about input delay.
[134:21.12]I'm talking about there's a little bit... When I move my mouse, it doesn't move.
[134:24.75]It's the second I move it.
[134:27.23]It's because it's a goddamn simulation.
[134:32.59]This actually is a glorified loading screen.
[134:34.62]That's what I thought.
[134:41.92]You load up the computer to load into the computer.
[134:48.67]Fucking video games, right?
[134:59.30]I'm gonna have to do this.
[135:03.43]Yeah.
[135:03.67]We're gonna have to go up for mouse sensitivity.
[135:07.93]Because I'm just gonna have to move a little slower.
[135:15.32]I'm just gonna have to figure it out.
[135:17.34]Just gonna have to deal with it.
[135:19.10]Unplug the controller and restart the game.
[135:20.32]I know some games have issues with the controllers plugged in.
[135:22.18]That's true.
[135:22.62]Maybe.
[135:24.38]Maybe.
[135:26.34]I'm just going to calm down and deal with the problem and fix it.
[135:31.86]Watch out.
[135:32.24]Watch out for the scary guy.
[135:40.20]It is happening a little when I move left and right.
[135:42.34]Alright, well, let's go.
[135:49.06]Do the same damn thing I just did.
[135:53.56]I think that's only in the menu.
[135:58.53]I actually probably could just stand up and, like, kill her.
[136:05.28]Although, I'll wait for the guy with the axe.
[136:07.80]I gotta kill the guy, then I've gotta get back in the house.
[136:10.92]Wait for her to move.
[136:12.34]Where's this, like, where's this actual... I gotta go this way.
[136:17.44]Keep that locked on.
[136:18.18]Alright, move out of the way so I can get behind him.
[136:23.66]It might be that, you know, it actually might be, like, the high graphics settings.
[136:26.49]I don't know.
[136:36.62]Sneak.
[136:41.81]Take the axe.
[136:42.71]Yep.
[136:45.37]Take it all quick before she turns around.
[136:48.81]Quick.
[136:49.73]Oh my god, she already turned around.
[136:50.81]Go, go, go, go.
[136:51.49]Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[136:53.84]What did they just pick up?
[136:55.84]Please.
[137:02.74]Can I close doors?
[137:07.30]This door doesn't open?
[137:08.92]Oh my lord.
[137:09.86]Why does this door not open?
[137:15.20]I have one exit out of here and it's through this lady.
[137:19.56]Where did she go?
[137:20.08]Is she in the house?
[137:23.84]Is she in the kitchen or something?
[137:30.97]Where is she?
[137:34.35]Where the fuck is this lady?
[137:38.17]Is she standing right behind this door?
[137:40.19]Oh my god, she is.
[137:41.09]Okay, hold on.
[137:47.30]What is the... Oh my god, wrong button.
[137:53.00]It's four.
[138:03.11]Come on, go that way.
[138:04.55]You didn't see it?
[138:05.15]See it?
[138:05.53]It's over there.
[138:09.21]Is she stuck in the door?
[138:14.89]I think she actually is stuck in the door right now.
[138:27.60]She doesn't see me, right?
[138:28.60]She doesn't see me, but the door is the blocker.
[138:31.42]Can I get behind her and stealth kill her?
[138:35.34]Here we go.
[138:35.62]She's going to look left and I'm going to stealth kill her.
[138:41.08]Go, alright, go that way then.
[138:50.64]She's looking for me, but you're looking for me in the worst place for you to be.
[138:53.56]This is like, fuck, alright, just, I'm going.
[139:01.39]Get me out of here.
[139:07.44]Alright, pull up the fucking device.
[139:08.70]Let's go this way.
[139:10.46]This is where we need to go.
[139:14.67]Cedar Avenue.
[139:18.85]Unbelievable.
[139:20.65]Now she sees me.
[139:21.55]She actually knows exactly where I am right now.
[139:48.51]I'm not being chased again, right?
[139:53.44]Give me the thing that's in the car.
[139:56.80]Oh, don't use that!
[140:02.58]I need that!
[140:03.10]Alright, we ended up back at like square one.
[140:13.74]So, I need to go this way.
[140:15.44]Stop sprinting.
[140:23.53]It's a shame they don't stop looking.
[140:24.65]I mean, I understand that that may make sense, right?
[140:26.89]But... I need to lower my graphics.
[140:32.89]That would be a shame, considering I have a fucking 6-core processor at 1080.
[140:39.13]And fucking 70 plus 70-something of RAM.
[140:44.21]I have like 60 gigs of RAM in here.
[140:51.66]What is in there?
[140:58.07]I'm just so paranoid to walk around.
[140:59.43]It feels like if you aggro like an enemy, you're just fucked.
[141:03.16]If you aggro like more than one enemy, say goodbye.
[141:07.34]So that's why I'm being so cautious.
[141:08.72]I'm just like hiding in the bushes right now.
[141:15.98]So I get like 50 fucking FPS in PUBG?
[141:19.59]Pretty much.
[141:31.96]I mean, all this game's marketing did not make it seem like it was going to be an open world survival game.
[141:41.93]I thought it was going to be like a scary game.
[141:47.23]And by scary game, I mean like a scary game.
[141:51.38]This is a gas leak in this house.
[142:01.41]That's how you can tell if there's a gas leak.
[142:06.59]Like typically I would be scared of what's happening right now.
[142:09.45]I'm not scared.
[142:10.34]I'm just like, I'm scared to die because I don't want to lose.
[142:12.82]I don't want to start back over there again.
[142:14.98]It's not, I'm not afraid.
[142:17.88]I'm cautious.
[142:19.42]There's a difference.
[142:24.03]My fear is not stemming from being scared.
[142:26.23]It's stemming from, I don't want to restart this mission, this area again.
[142:33.61]Okay, so they apparently were like here.
[142:41.67]Flashlight.
[142:45.84]No, there's a door here.
[142:52.64]Can't be open.
[143:01.66]Unknown residence.
[143:03.08]Okay.
[143:07.27]What was the point of coming in here, then?
[143:11.01]Upstairs?
[143:11.99]Laundry room?
[143:13.73]Bathroom?
[143:16.97]Do you have anywhere else to go in your house?
[143:19.03]Down here?
[143:19.41]I hear somebody moving around.
[143:36.89]Fuse.
[143:44.31]Crowbar.
[143:49.67]And a, like, medical gurney.
[143:52.29]What kind of a fucking weirdo has this in their garage?
[143:57.78]Handwritten note.
[143:58.46]Yeah, detective.
[143:59.96]Excuse me, detective.
[144:02.64]Nothing to worry about.
[144:03.30]Just tick a few boxes, answer a few questions from Jim.
[144:10.07]I guess we still have to go that way.
[144:24.66]Keep going.
[144:25.70]Sure.
[144:34.23]I guess we're leaving again.
[144:36.83]Can't leave.
[144:37.27]There's going to be somebody behind me.
[144:40.28]Something's going to happen in this house.
[144:41.68]There's going to be a fucking explosion and somebody's going to break through the wall.
[144:46.80]No, the TV is on.
[144:52.18]Oh, and the TV's going to... File number 15.
[144:57.12]Interview with Detective Sebastian Castellanos.
[145:00.94]Detective, could you please tell me about that day at Beacon Mental Hospital?
[145:06.32]I've told you ten times already.
[145:08.32]Oh, God.
[145:08.74]Let me go through it one more time.
[145:13.97]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[145:15.81]So the input delay is actually a weapon sway mechanic that everyone hates about the game.
[145:20.02]Upgrading your aim gets rid of it.
[145:30.97]Oh.
[145:34.09]Oh.
[145:40.11]Why would...
[145:43.44]Why would you put that in the game?
[145:47.61]What the fuck is that in the game for?
[145:52.25]I'm not moving the mouse.
[145:53.81]I am fucking not moving the mouse.
[145:55.65]By the way, if you're curious.
[146:03.46]I was fucking wondering, I was like, what is going on with my like mouse?
[146:05.88]What's with like the input delay?
[146:07.40]What's going on here?
[146:13.28]Alright, now I understand.
[146:18.14]I get it now.
[146:18.72]Okay, I was trying to... My brain just couldn't comprehend what the fuck was going on.
[146:24.80]Well... Gonna have... There's the realism for you.
[146:32.65]Okay.
[146:33.55]I thought I was going crazy.
[146:34.61]That's why I was getting so angry.
[146:35.75]I was like, what the fuck is going on with my brain?
[146:37.31]Am I this stupid?
[146:38.93]Don't answer that.
[146:40.59]Don't answer that.
[146:42.05]I can't leave this house, so I'm going to get attacked by a giant monster.
[146:53.60]I play video games to escape realism.
[146:55.94]I know, right?
[146:56.58]You don't need to move my mouse for me when I'm aiming.
[146:59.16]What the fuck was that?
[147:04.22]Alright, I'm going to...
[147:09.84]Alright, now we... Everyone calm down.
[147:11.40]We're cool.
[147:12.33]I'm gonna calm down.
[147:13.21]Uh, Psychological File Association is my recommendation.
[147:19.69]The detective castle lands.
[147:22.09]Oh, the bottom half is gone.
[147:23.53]I don't know what the doctor wanted me to do!
[147:25.37]Now we're at a hospital.
[147:44.55]I think I saw that.
[147:47.13]I think I was making fucking crass macaroni and cheese when I first got spotted by the demon.
[148:00.24]That was the counseling they made me do after.
[148:02.74]Mm-hmm.
[148:04.48]That is the counseling they made you do.
[148:05.84]Something's gonna jump in my face.
[148:09.13]Not gonna... Oh, no!
[148:14.15]Almost made it.
[148:23.62]You know, part of me wants to kind of just say, I get it.
[148:26.80]You know?
[148:31.12]Part of me wants to say I get it.
[148:32.32]This is just Alan Wright.
[148:35.23]With a different title.
[148:37.25]You're gonna like fucking fire axe this guy.
[148:56.79]Was he just head-shrinking me here?
[148:59.63]Did he know something I didn't?
[149:00.93]Was he head-shrinking me?
[149:03.61]You think that guy was like a witch doctor?
[149:04.99]What the fuck are you talking about?
[149:05.97]Door!
[149:08.43]Investigate.
[149:09.33]What does it say?
[149:10.55]You cannot keep me here.
[149:13.10]I saw.
[149:22.26]You cannot keep me here.
[149:24.82]Watch it.
[149:25.36]Watch it.
[149:25.76]The back...
[149:27.25]Perfectly framed.
[149:30.25]Perfectly framed scary part.
[149:37.45]Okay.
[149:42.36]Here comes the spider lady with the detached spine.
[149:47.06]Grab a couple of inhalers.
[149:49.00]For your asthma.
[149:50.74]Can we get back to making fucking jokes?
[149:53.47]Oh wait, I gotta sit in the wheelchair and learn.
[150:09.86]Trying to act like I'm not scared?
[150:11.13]It's not that I'm not scared.
[150:12.35]I told you, I'm scared for different reasons.
[150:20.29]We need to get more jokes and stuff.
[150:23.23]Remember, if you sit in a wheelchair, you get to upgrade skills.
[150:27.12]You just have to go into Professor X mode.
[150:28.80]Did they just add black bars to my game?
[150:38.98]They did.
[150:42.06]This has to be like an in-reference, right?
[150:43.88]They added black bars to the game.
[150:48.84]It's a reference to the first game, the one that everyone hated this shit.
[150:54.91]This is how the first game was.
[150:56.61]I remember, that's why I didn't want to play it anymore.
[150:59.49]I gave up on the first game because of this.
[151:01.99]Is that me?
[151:08.17]That is actually kind of funny that they did that.
[151:10.52]Watch it be here the rest of the game.
[151:12.72]Watch, ready?
[151:28.15]Oh man, I need to stop doing so many drugs.
[151:30.13]What the hell is going on?
[151:32.11]This whole game has been I do drugs and wake up in random fucking video games.
[151:36.55]What video game am I in now?
[151:41.81]Are those just memories?
[151:44.95]Don't ever, never forget it.
[151:46.75]Okay, don't ever forget.
[151:48.46]What?
[151:49.96]What do you want?
[151:50.52]Sebastian, are you alright?
[151:52.52]Isn't this, is that jelly beans?
[151:54.98]You're about to go into cardiac arrest.
[151:57.10]I saw a beacon.
[151:59.37]I was there again.
[152:00.57]How could that be?
[152:01.27]This is a completely new stem.
[152:03.99]I don't know.
[152:05.49]It's gonna happen again.
[152:06.01]What is that?
[152:06.57]Why is it so big?
[152:07.63]Do you see how big this is?
[152:08.83]This is a lifetime supply of whatever item this is.
[152:26.74]bread gel this mysterious blood red liquid is used to open locked skill upgrade branches well I don't need any more because I have like seven quarts of it and what's that paper airplane harpoon bolt this crossbow bolt impales stuck opponents harpoon bolts make no sound when fired so they can be very useful in certain situations they can be crafted from metal pipes
[152:57.52]Alright.
[152:59.10]So let... I gotta go this way now.
[153:03.98]That's where that voice is.
[153:06.12]Still haven't found the girl voice.
[153:09.95]We will.
[153:11.33]We will.
[153:25.90]I'm trying to, like, investigate this fucking door.
[153:27.80]Alright, there are way too many people over there.
[153:31.74]I would have to go this way.
[153:33.18]Oh, my fucking lo- How am I supposed to go over there?
[153:37.63]Ah, that's what I- Like, it's like an open world game.
[153:40.75]Like, I have to go over there, to that house.
[153:43.55]You have to, like, sneak the fuck around and... This is just Hitman.
[153:49.95]This is zombie Hitman.
[153:53.29]They probably sat in a room and they were like, you know what I think people would really love?
[153:56.99]If we made a Hitman game.
[153:59.33]Yeah, that would be actually kind of fun, boss.
[154:01.25]Yeah, but the only difference is it's just zombies.
[154:05.28]There's no actually intelligent life.
[154:07.54]It's just like two hit zombies.
[154:10.94]Green light that, please.
[154:12.16]As fast as you can.
[154:13.75]What's with the rainbow car?
[154:24.79]Fucking Mario sure had a bad time on fucking Rainbow Road.
[154:37.88]And now, like, I'm gonna get trailed by everybody, because everyone's gonna make noise and shit, and I'm gonna get followed forever.
[154:45.10]Well, this is... If you're gonna have fucking jump scares, and guys hiding behind shit, like, why are they so easy to... Forget it.
[155:05.13]I think I found it.
[155:09.19]Should we talk shit or should we enjoy it?
[155:11.10]You know, it is hard for me to not.
[155:13.00]What the hell is that?
[155:20.88]I guess part of me is like, just doesn't... Okay, like you can honk horns.
[155:31.47]That's cool.
[155:38.20]Are you in here?
[155:38.72]This way.
[155:45.89]Yeah, why can you honk the horns?
[155:52.81]Are you the car?
[155:55.13]Do I have to get inside the pit stop?
[155:57.99]I'm assuming that's what I have to do.
[156:05.72]Wait, you're telling me that voice was this little girl?
[156:10.17]Excuse me.
[156:11.87]Excuse me.
[156:15.47]Don't call me names.
[156:16.97]That's not a little girl's voice.
[156:19.41]That's a fucking, like, 30-year-old lady pretending to be a two-year-old.
[156:24.69]Honest to God, listen to that.
[156:25.81]Are you telling me that's supposed to be, like, a fucking four-year-old?
[156:29.73]That's legit a fucking 30-year-old lady making that noise.
[156:44.01]That's not an excuse.
[156:45.09]That's legit.
[156:46.31]That's like a fucking 34-year-old lady making that noise.
[156:50.33]If it was like a baby or like a little child, I would have been like, oh, okay.
[156:53.95]Are these lilies?
[157:03.29]Really?
[157:04.85]Are you here?
[157:06.93]It's dad.
[157:08.89]Where did she go?
[157:12.18]Oh, wow, my memories are fusing together!
[157:14.26]Do I still need to use this?
[157:18.64]No, won't follow the footprints.
[157:19.95]Wait, alright, alright, alright, alright, come on, Celebrimbror, tell me where to go!
[157:22.75]Office.
[157:32.37]Drink a shot every time.
[157:34.64]I'm too hard on this game?
[157:35.80]I don't think I am.
[157:37.52]I don't think, I don't know, I don't think I am.
[157:41.97]This game is like trying to be like three different video games.
[157:44.67]This is the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them video game.
[157:51.69]You want to go survival, go survival.
[157:53.04]You want to go like story, go story.
[157:57.14]The ends kind of don't justify the means for me.
[158:12.36]I'm still playing it.
[158:13.42]I'm telling you, I'm giving it a chance.
[158:16.72]It's just not what I thought it was going to be.
[158:18.16]But it's still... So far, it's not... I'm not going to give it a bad thumbs down yet.
[158:24.98]Shadow of War was a two fucking thumbs up.
[158:28.15]I think that might be my favorite game of the year so far.
[158:30.29]Like in Cuphead.
[158:31.25]Without a fucking doubt.
[158:32.45]Shadow of War is on the top of my list.
[158:35.73]Regardless of the dumb shit that they pulled with the microtransaction horse shit.
[158:44.18]Got a short attention span tonight?
[158:46.46]I don't think so.
[158:47.92]If that were the case, I would have stopped after I died for like the fourth time with that first enemy.
[158:56.53]That's an interesting way to say next.
[159:16.73]Do I have to control her now and run around?
[159:24.82]Is this going to be like a Ren and Stimpy situation where I think that's her?
[159:29.16]Oh, Lily!
[159:29.94]Don't worry, I'll protect you!
[159:31.68]You're my daughter, for Christ's sake!
[159:33.12]I'm not going to think that that's actually like a... Like the bar of soap from Ren and Stimpy, am I?
[159:46.35]I have to kick every door, I'm sorry.
[159:49.41]Go behind the restaurant.
[159:52.75]I gotta go behind the bag!
[159:56.23]It gets through Buckner!
[160:00.69]Come on, behind the bag!
[160:02.23]It's behind the bag!
[160:05.52]I was hoping for a jump scare there, but it wasn't there.
[160:12.20]Search for clues behind the restaurant.
[160:13.90]L.A.
[160:14.08]Noire, the video game.
[160:17.08]What do you know?
[160:17.60]You can go like this.
[160:32.07]I'm behind the restaurant.
[160:33.89]Come on.
[160:34.47]Where are the clues?
[160:40.55]Over here?
[160:42.81]In the dumpster?
[160:44.39]If I was a clue, I'd be in the dumpster.
[160:46.84]Yep.
[160:49.06]All right, Lily.
[160:50.86]Where did you run off?
[160:52.93]All right, Lily, are you in the dumpster?
[161:02.61]I don't think she's in the dumpster.
[161:06.85]What the?
[161:11.23]Another signal.
[161:13.05]Good.
[161:14.48]I'm coming, sweetheart.
[161:16.22]Just hang in there.
[161:18.20]Where are you?
[161:26.29]Oh, great.
[161:26.65]Here comes a fucking rat.
[161:27.67]A rat cam.
[161:28.25]Alright, that very clearly was already here.
[161:35.01]Oh, there it is.
[161:35.53]It's... Okay, it's more than one.
[161:39.27]Alright, I got strategy.
[161:40.97]Strategy!
[161:42.23]Strategy!
[161:44.62]Prodigy!
[161:49.54]It's a gas station!
[161:50.90]It's a gas station, come on!
[161:56.23]It's a gas station, fellas and ladies.
[162:05.72]I'm gonna die.
[162:06.52]Like, I can't run fast.
[162:07.80]Like...
[162:14.50]I thought they... I thought it was one shot to kill them for a second.
[162:20.41]I was about to be very fucking upset.
[162:25.29]Gonna turn off my flashlight.
[162:27.85]Let me start it over.
[162:33.18]Realism strikes again.
[162:39.82]Okay, well here we go.
[162:40.81]Here they come.
[162:45.92]Gotta do stamina management.
[162:47.26]Here they are.
[162:48.50]Watch out.
[162:49.20]Here comes the werewolf.
[163:07.18]Holy shit.
[163:07.46]I'm gonna fucking break, man.
[163:09.62]What the fuck?
[163:18.62]That's it, right?
[163:21.56]Jesus.
[163:22.06]Nice bass boosted shotgun.
[163:30.08]Really is a bass boosted shotgun.
[163:35.59]Somebody's like listening to fucking loud music.
[163:41.35]Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[163:44.53]It's like, boom.
[163:48.26]We need some more treble.
[163:53.20]Oh, I fucking love... Every... And that's another problem I have with this game so far.
[163:58.73]All the scary things, scary things have been set up by here's a cutscene showing you the scary thing you're about to be scared by.
[164:07.65]Just fucking jump at me.
[164:08.90]Just, like, come after me.
[164:10.42]Be in a house.
[164:12.50]You don't need to set up every single scary enemy, and that might be because...
[164:17.20]It's like showing you them for the first time.
[164:18.84]I don't know.
[164:21.73]I seem to have a lot of complaints.
[164:26.65]And like, all right.
[164:27.39]So for right now, the in-between, like me going from spot to spot, right?
[164:33.61]This like open world go from place to place is interesting.
[164:37.30]But when I get to the place, it becomes like a story game again.
[164:45.78]This is a dangerous thing for me to be doing here.
[164:49.94]What happened to my fingers?
[164:59.25]I don't want to come out.
[165:00.05]Why can I not see this on my mini-map?
[165:03.19]Come on, man.
[165:04.73]Really?
[165:04.99]Okay, it's over here.
[165:07.70]We are not going over to fuck with that lady.
[165:11.29]story events in an open world game how dare you no that's not what I mean I mean like every time I get to another destination nothing happens it just shows me a cutscene then I go through the open world town to get to the other next cutscene I'm just going through to cutscene to cutscene with like the in between like a few houses and shit and watch over the scary monsters that'll kill you I hope I'm not describing every video game I kind of am
[165:41.67]I'm just going, man.
[165:42.43]It's just going cutscene to cutscene.
[165:45.54]There's side missions, but... I don't know.
[165:50.06]Do I care about these side missions?
[165:55.17]Well, it's over here somewhere.
[166:11.70]Okay, well, we're here.
[166:12.53]We gotta find the... We gotta find the cutscene trigger, wherever it is.
[166:17.59]It's around here somewhere.
[166:21.25]I hear a zombie, too, that... They're already after me now.
[166:42.74]A lot of keys.
[166:43.68]Take it.
[166:44.28]Take the key.
[166:45.96]Take the key.
[166:47.00]This door doesn't open.
[166:48.93]Oh, there's a lot of boxes.
[167:04.18]Come on, Lily.
[167:04.86]Where are you?
[167:05.60]Where is this random...
[167:09.33]Where is she?
[167:09.83]Where's this stupid outline?
[167:10.99]Where's like the little girl that's standing there that I have to talk to?
[167:18.56]Over here?
[167:18.98]Is she in the shed?
[167:24.24]Honey.
[167:25.36]Come on out of the shed, honey.
[167:28.48]Equip the communicator.
[167:37.81]What the fuck happened?
[167:38.85]Why was I just surfing?
[167:45.47]The lily's gone.
[167:46.37]Lily's gone now.
[167:47.17]I don't know how to...
[168:10.85]I don't have any fucking bullets.
[168:13.96]You know what?
[168:15.10]Get the fuck out of here.
[168:24.96]Tune it!
[168:26.38]Press another button to activate the cutscene, please.
[168:46.72]This shit is making me mad and nude.
[168:49.52]Wait, why are you getting nude?
[168:52.69]Oi, blood, hold on, investigate.
[168:54.71]A few days old.
[168:56.41]Hope it's not Lily's.
[168:58.25]Oh, it's not Lily's?
[169:00.72]Oh, there she goes, get her!
[169:29.42]We got a new sound, boys and girls.
[169:33.86]Let's go find her.
[169:35.10]Hide and seek with Lily and dad.
[169:37.08]The video game.
[169:43.27]No, we're not next thing.
[169:44.81]I can't, I have to know.
[169:51.47]Ooh, crafting.
[169:57.35]I'm being too harsh.
[169:58.49]I am.
[170:00.09]Am I?
[170:00.35]Am I?
[170:09.70]I might be.
[170:34.23]140.
[170:34.85]Shotgun.
[170:42.03]It's always ammo capacity first.
[170:46.98]Yeah.
[170:49.84]So I have one screw.
[170:51.98]I can get level 2 enhancements.
[170:55.20]Use a high grade weapon part to upgrade your weapon to level 2.
[170:59.51]But why?
[171:01.60]It's almost like you don't, I don't even like, I don't really need to be using the weapons.
[171:05.66]I don't, I'm just kind of confused about this whole thing.
[171:19.00]Level two, screw.
[171:20.76]Yeah, I'm doing a face cam because I thought this was like a horror game and it needed like a face cam, but it doesn't need a face cam at all.
[171:27.90]You don't need a facecam to play hide and seek with a little girl.
[171:31.98]Like hide and seek with a daughter, you don't need to do that.
[171:39.31]High capacity assault screw.
[171:45.63]I thought that just came right back down on my head.
[171:50.86]And why can't I drive the car?
[171:52.34]Can I not drive these?
[171:55.37]You can just honk horns to attract enemies.
[171:57.33]Alright, so let's... Go back to Lily's voice.
[172:08.61]I didn't make any handgun bullets, did I?
[172:19.38]There's like three things now on my menu.
[172:23.36]Rogue signal, Lily's voice, and unknown.
[172:30.73]Am I?
[172:31.01]Okay, I'm on like the story mission, right?
[172:33.25]I have to be because I'm getting cutscenes.
[172:35.81]It's not a side mission.
[172:41.76]I'm so afraid to walk in this game.
[172:45.38]I really hate to be like a complaining asshole.
[172:47.55]I really do.
[172:48.07]What?
[172:48.19]You're looking at a fucking garbage can?
[172:52.83]What was that?
[172:55.19]What did I just pick out of the garbage?
[172:57.57]Oh, okay.
[173:01.14]Let me use a stim one.
[173:08.64]I've been complaining.
[173:09.50]I know.
[173:10.08]I'm terribly sorry about that.
[173:13.12]I don't want to be that guy, but I am that guy right now.
[173:18.47]Here we go.
[173:19.47]Another Lily hide-and-seek mission.
[173:24.47]They might not even be justified complaints, though, because a lot of people like this kind of shit.
[173:29.23]They're searching for clues and walking around and... walking around and looking at stuff and... That's it.
[173:42.71]That's it.
[173:48.34]I'm not going to judge anybody.
[173:51.92]Okay, let's hold up here.
[173:53.52]Hmm.
[173:57.25]I wish I knew what the purpose of this actually was.
[173:58.91]Why even make me hold R?
[174:02.36]Time to chase her again.
[174:03.52]Let's go.
[174:05.60]She ran into this.
[174:06.72]Oh, she ran into this random beam of light.
[174:09.58]Thank God.
[174:18.99]I wanted a horror game.
[174:19.91]Instead, we got a survival open-world action stealth game.
[174:25.10]But this might just be like the very- This might be like the beginning of the game, right?
[174:30.60]This might just be the awful, stupid fucking thing that game companies do nowadays.
[174:34.58]I complained about it with Echo, and I'm gonna do it again.
[174:37.28]We're gonna be real again.
[174:39.89]I understand if you wanna have like a story, I understand- Like, if in like fucking an hour and a half this game gets like really crazy and fun and scary-
[174:49.45]Why are you hiding your fun game behind, like, a fucking story that takes forever to fucking tell it?
[174:54.93]You know what I mean?
[174:55.51]The company's been doing this lately.
[174:57.45]It's really... I just... I don't like it.
[174:58.83]It's not a review of the game itself.
[175:02.50]It's just a review of kind of... games... wanting to be more than what they should be.
[175:10.40]No, we've gotta... we've gotta have this fucking super crazy twist storyline.
[175:17.06]It's like, if the game's good, the game's good.
[175:21.51]Video games are trying to do this thing nowadays where they try to be every single genre at the same time.
[175:27.29]Every single one.
[175:30.50]You know what, Jeremiah?
[175:31.16]I don't like you.
[175:31.86]I'm sorry.
[175:33.70]I'm sorry you don't.
[175:35.66]I'm sorry.
[175:56.83]Kick over the oil.
[175:57.79]What oil?
[175:58.27]What do you mean kick over the oil drum?
[176:00.43]That guy just threw a knife at me.
[176:03.45]Zombies have knife throwing abilities?
[176:09.59]I don't even know where the fuck I... I gotta move this, I think.
[176:11.86]Here he comes.
[176:17.34]Here comes the bad guys.
[176:19.28]Gotta restore the power to the doors.
[176:21.88]I love how he says, or something.
[176:27.36]I don't know.
[176:27.72]Maybe you go over there or something.
[176:28.80]Who knows?
[176:30.24]I'm not the one playing the game, dickhead.
[176:31.71]It's you.
[176:32.05]And there's people in here.
[176:36.39]I'm dead.
[176:58.39]She must be in that warehouse smart girl smart girl lots of good places to hide in there I bet I'm sure there is Turn off the flashlight Could have shot the oil but like I It's gonna blow me up too, you know, I don't want to die too.
[177:20.56]I
[177:30.13]It's taking a long time to get those bullets off that guy's back.
[177:35.89]Somebody's already dead in there.
[177:41.47]That was perfect.
[177:43.13]I actually did like that.
[177:47.47]I need to make some medicine, man.
[177:55.12]Yeah.
[177:56.32]She's over there.
[177:57.32]I gotta wrap around the side.
[177:58.68]I can't go straight in there.
[177:59.64]There's too many people fucking wailing around aimlessly.
[178:03.60]I have to wait until this guy turns around because he'll see me.
[178:08.87]Look at how good their eyesight is.
[178:15.93]That's really good fucking eyesight, man.
[178:18.81]For a dead person.
[178:23.53]Now he's coming this way.
[178:25.56]Your brain is supposed to be mush.
[178:29.54]I'm just gonna run in and just shoot the oil can to see what happens.
[178:33.09]I'm gonna knock it over and then shoot it.
[178:34.41]Check over the oil drum.
[178:55.21]Why?
[178:55.79]What the f-?
[178:58.25]Words can't- Alright, where's the guy with the axe?
[179:21.07]That didn't kill her.
[179:22.05]Thank god.
[179:22.49]There's another guy in here.
[179:31.34]Go on, move it.
[179:32.80]Wait, I'm going to shoot this guy right in the face.
[179:36.61]Throw his axe.
[179:41.35]Where are you carrying these things from, man?
[179:46.37]I hear another guy, too.
[179:48.58]Where's this other guy?
[179:50.34]Come on, man.
[179:56.04]Pull it back.
[179:58.88]He had another one.
[179:59.80]He had two ACRs.
[180:04.23]Yeah, he had multiple kill strings Why would I even come up here Over here anything there's nothing up here This is just a way to get out of here don't jump over the fence, please I gotta be very careful because I don't want to I
[180:44.48]Hey guys, how are ya?
[180:48.16]Oh no!
[180:49.96]Who's that guy trying to get in?
[181:06.92]They're gonna come all the way around.
[181:07.94]Look at how smart they are.
[181:09.01]Look at how fucking smart these guys are.
[181:11.77]They're coming all the way up and down around the buildings.
[181:17.35]You can't do this shit.
[181:19.38]Oh, there's a ladder.
[181:20.06]These guys knew where the ladder was before I did.
[181:24.84]They understand that... Get out from the boxes!
[181:38.31]Why do I keep getting stuck on the boxes?
[181:42.49]Climb it.
[181:43.89]Climb the ladder.
[181:44.65]Get up on that ladder, you fucking idiot.
[181:47.95]No.
[181:48.65]No, don't let him get up here.
[181:50.25]Don't.
[181:55.43]I didn't do anything.
[182:00.49]Alright, turn the power back on.
[182:01.63]Get down!
[182:02.21]You dumbass.
[182:07.27]Oh my god, what a disaster!
[182:12.11]Give me that axe now.
[182:19.51]I know, I understand.
[182:20.47]I don't know, maybe I've heard something about that power cord over there somewhere.
[182:25.61]I know, I get it.
[182:27.41]Get out of the cutscene, he's right behind me, he's gonna fucking hit me!
[182:42.92]I almost just started pissing.
[182:51.14]In real life.
[183:01.89]I just keep rippling my veins with adrenaline.
[183:07.83]You did it.
[183:08.35]Congratulations.
[183:09.21]You turned on the power.
[183:12.75]Derma being a dummy does not equal bad game.
[183:27.44]I'm not saying it's a bad game.
[183:28.60]I'm saying it's an awful game.
[183:36.15]That's a joke.
[183:36.79]I'm kidding.
[183:38.09]There's probably people here that really like this game.
[183:39.97]Look, I'm not trying to... I'm just kidding.
[183:42.79]A lot of these are jokes.
[183:43.67]That's what we do here on Jeremy985.
[183:48.88]We find some funny things.
[183:50.30]We fucking talk shit sarcastically about stuff.
[183:53.08]You know what I mean?
[183:55.44]Lily?
[183:59.15]Shit.
[183:59.79]Get it.
[184:01.67]Maybe we like, we're looking like sarcastic on this stream.
[184:04.12]We like go like, fuck you.
[184:06.08]And then people go like, holy shit, do you hear what he said about fucking The Last of Us 2?
[184:18.70]Can I kick that with my shoe?
[184:24.19]I'm not actually going to try this.
[184:25.41]Okay, I thought I was going to slide underneath that.
[184:27.67]Okay, that would have been so funny.
[184:34.32]She's a brave and resourceful little girl.
[184:35.82]I thought I was gonna wedge under there.
[184:36.88]She's gonna be okay.
[184:38.98]I just gotta find her.
[184:40.40]She's a brave and resourceful girl.
[184:43.23]It's okay.
[184:44.15]She'll find her way out of here.
[184:55.53]You get, like, just too much setup.
[184:59.61]That was like, that was more comical than it was scary.
[185:05.32]This guy just like fell down.
[185:06.44]This is like comedy.
[185:16.01]And I don't have any healing either.
[185:17.29]This is so... I saw him.
[185:27.56]I saw the guy.
[185:29.10]Where is your survival?
[185:30.44]And the guy disappeared.
[185:34.36]That guy disappeared, crawled under here, and died right there.
[185:38.24]That's what happened to that guy.
[185:58.57]This is too much setup.
[185:59.59]You're giving me too much to see.
[186:02.07]If that guy just jumped down before, instead of, like, four, like, breadcrumb trails to watch out for the scary thing, he knocked over some stuff, I teleported a few times, he made a lot of noise, and then he just appeared in front of my face.
[186:20.54]Wait, is that the trash?
[186:22.00]Look in the trash cans.
[186:26.35]I kind of need to make upgrades right now.
[186:33.83]Speaking of making upgrades, here we go.
[186:37.80]Craft.
[186:39.70]There's something.
[186:40.56]What is this?
[186:42.34]There's a shock bolt.
[186:43.28]You can freeze them.
[186:44.50]It's just dying light.
[186:48.18]I need to make some bullets.
[186:57.13]What does this get?
[186:59.03]Remember, all you're going to get from me, ever...
[187:02.07]And it's something that I'll always promise, and even if people are new here, like, if you're, like, new to the stream, you're just, like, checking out, um, you know, let's just say you're just checking out, uh, The Evil Within 2, right?
[187:13.36]I forgot what the name of this fucking game was.
[187:17.78]I'm just gonna, I'm, everything I will say will be real, and I'm not gonna ever sugarcoat anything.
[187:21.83]I'm fucking no sugarcoat, you know what I mean?
[187:23.09]I'm fucking real.
[187:26.71]Anyways, um, what does this game have for reviews?
[187:32.76]Like, what does this game have for a rating right now?
[187:38.90]I am not new here.
[187:40.02]Well... A bunch of armchair critics judging the game without playing it.
[187:47.43]That does tend to happen.
[187:50.73]An 8.
[187:50.99]There's like an 8.
[187:54.39]An 8.
[187:54.51]Might as well... I mean, I'm just gonna use him up.
[188:01.63]An 8.
[188:02.76]3.5 out of 5, 8 out of 10.
[188:03.36]8.5 out of 10.
[188:03.74]9 out of 10 on Steam, 8 out of 10 from IGN.
[188:06.71]What does this game have that makes it an 8 or a 9?
[188:08.15]I understand it's polished.
[188:08.85]Is that all it takes?
[188:29.52]have like a game get like a decent review score if the game is like just polished and like it works and maybe I mean is it just like a slow start I I just don't I feel like what we've seen so far in like two or three hours is just not this doesn't seem like there's any it's there's nothing here so far I really hope it's just a slow start uh I want to level up the shotgun now the uh 100
[189:04.07]Weapon capacity, reload time, fire rate, I don't want that.
[189:09.94]The game gets good about 15 hours in.
[189:13.12]How long is the game?
[189:19.36]15 hours in, is this game like fucking 60 hours long?
[189:25.75]The ammo capacity again for the shotgun.
[189:34.12]Wait, is this a fucking long-ass game?
[189:44.63]Oh, it's a joke?
[189:45.29]Oh, okay.
[189:46.35]Whoops.
[189:49.45]Here's another report from Morpheus Studios.
[189:55.97]Upgrading anything but firepower.
[189:57.39]I know, that's probably pretty dumb thing, but...
[190:03.74]I'm at that stage of the game where I'm trying to, like, get interest.
[190:07.26]I'm trying to stay interested.
[190:11.34]Because I don't have anything to do here.
[190:12.44]I've got to find the girl again.
[190:16.63]Another doll.
[190:19.37]Bullets.
[190:21.27]Just crafted a bunch of them.
[190:22.75]I'm glad.
[190:23.95]Good for me that I just upgraded this.
[190:26.46]No.
[190:29.84]Go fight Sauron.
[190:36.96]If you hate it, why don't you just next?
[190:38.60]Oh, I don't like hate it.
[190:41.62]I'm trying to just decipher if I want to continue to play it.
[190:46.27]And if it takes like an hour or two, two, three hours to like get really into the meat of the game, then I'm willing to give it a shot.
[190:57.01]We'll know by the time we get to like, how long have I been playing?
[190:59.51]Like three hours?
[191:00.87]Two hours?
[191:05.99]I don't hate it.
[191:06.51]I just enjoy nothing about it.
[191:07.96]I just don't want to be a negative Nancy and that's what I'm doing.
[191:14.10]That's exactly what I'm being.
[191:15.68]I don't want to be that.
[191:18.64]It's been over three hours?
[191:19.76]Holy shit.
[191:20.66]What the hell have we been doing?
[191:30.52]Him.
[191:31.96]The murderer with the camera.
[191:33.88]And the son of a bitch has my little girl.
[191:36.50]I was so close.
[191:38.50]Damn it.
[191:39.96]Calm down.
[191:41.45]Shadow of war.
[191:42.91]I gotta save her.
[191:44.21]No more signals coming into this communicator.
[191:46.57]Criticizing games.
[191:47.51]I just got an achievement.
[191:48.57]O'Neil.
[191:50.25]Not sure I can trust him.
[191:52.15]But he wants out of here as bad as I want to find Lily.
[191:54.53]I don't think I can trust O'Neil.
[191:56.68]Let's get on the phone and ask him.
[191:58.54]O'Neil, it's Sebastian.
[192:00.38]Can you hear me?
[192:01.48]Sebastian?
[192:02.88]Is that you?
[192:05.72]You're breaking up.
[192:06.24]You're fucking up.
[192:06.75]Shit.
[192:07.23]Not now.
[192:08.35]Maybe it'll work better outside.
[192:10.49]Give him a call outside and get chased by the monster.
[192:18.01]Here comes the scary monster in about five seconds.
[192:27.73]Tutorial complete.
[192:31.69]Is this the guy that played The Evil Within on... What are all the streamers saying about this game?
[192:40.06]If you watch anybody else that's played this so far.
[192:43.70]Are they like... Fuck yeah.
[192:45.75]Or are they kind of indifferent?
[192:59.67]Nobody else is playing it.
[193:05.20]Here comes the camera again!
[193:14.98]Stream for a speedrun?
[193:16.27]Oh boy, you would not be able to speedrun this game.
[193:18.29]We're in like the museum of strange pictures of people dying.
[193:33.34]Alright.
[193:37.29]You could walk fast.
[193:40.05]Tell me what other people think so I can validate my opinions.
[193:42.37]No, no, that's what I'm saying.
[193:43.35]I'm saying, like, does everybody like this game?
[193:45.41]Am I, like, the odd one out?
[193:48.16]I'm not saying, like, oh, validate my opinions for me.
[193:50.42]I don't care about that.
[193:52.36]I just want to know if, like, I'm the guy that's saying the game, that I don't like it.
[193:55.76]I just didn't know.
[193:58.03]Can't let him get away again.
[194:02.88]I tried to not let him get away.
[194:04.10]That guy's not real.
[194:08.32]I'm not controlling the character right now.
[194:09.60]Here comes a fucking scare.
[194:10.52]Seems like I'm the odd one out.
[194:15.15]Okay.
[194:37.61]The eye of Sauron awaits.
[194:39.38]Fuck.
[194:39.68]I already, like, almost dead.
[194:55.11]Give me that fucking base.
[194:56.19]Now, when they make, like, the loud noise, that means they're dead, right?
[195:05.48]No.
[195:05.56]Okay, they have to make two loud noises.
[195:15.63]He's not dead.
[195:48.74]That reload speed sure came in handy.
[195:54.02]Oh yeah, good thing I did that reload speed.
[196:33.80]Get out of the way of the grass!
[196:36.30]Get out of the way of the grass!
[196:37.44]That just did the Metal Gear Solid sound.
[196:52.96]No, but I know who has her.
[196:55.34]And he's got powers like nothing else in here.
[196:57.38]Nothing else.
[196:57.94]He's got these powers.
[196:59.08]I think I can help you out with that.
[197:00.40]I picked up a frequency I've never seen before.
[197:03.28]It's coming from City Hall.
[197:04.80]Great.
[197:05.78]Where's that?
[197:06.42]This game's supposed to be scary.
[197:07.94]Do you see a building with a big clock tower?
[197:10.11]I could have just done that.
[197:11.05]You don't have to do that for me.
[197:12.73]How in the hell am I supposed to get up there?
[197:15.23]It's a bit complex.
[197:17.31]Come back here.
[197:17.85]I can explain.
[197:19.09]Right.
[197:20.29]I'm on my way.
[197:29.29]What is going on?
[197:34.69]Alright, well they just spawned in way more enemies.
[197:38.01]This is a floating knife.
[197:40.03]This is the fucking beauty in the beast.
[197:43.64]The fucking kitchenware can talk and walk and move around.
[197:55.18]Sit in wheelchairs.
[197:58.32]Alright.
[197:59.04]So, I need to get up there.
[198:01.74]And all he told me was, you know, it's a bit complicated.
[198:04.89]You'll figure it out.
[198:05.57]Go walk around and look at some houses some more.
[198:08.37]You see that bus?
[198:10.19]Pretty cool.
[198:10.77]Pretty cool bus.
[198:19.79]Should I, like, go over there and do that?
[198:21.21]Or should I just fucking who cares about the side mission and just try to get to where I need to go?
[198:35.55]You can't you gotta like look up just go to the safe house, yeah Go to O'Neill's house Go to old O'Neill I'm gonna we're gonna get in the fucking mothership together dude.

[199:09.09]Okay, let's tab.
[199:14.59]There's the signal.
[199:15.64]Where's the safe house?
[199:17.38]Computer.

[199:33.52]Where the fuck am I now?
[199:34.40]All the way over here.
[199:36.64]Is there fast travel in this Bethesda video game?

[202:14.79]Let's just... I'm going to get here and then I'm going to... How long have I been streaming for?

[203:15.36]You made it here okay.
[203:17.06]Not sure if okay is the right word, but yeah, I made it.

[206:28.50]And I'll give you like a... You know what I'm saying?
[206:30.82]Like a... Give you a little wink.
[206:33.92]In the meantime, let's just like... Chapter 4.
[206:38.05]Wait.
[206:38.63]Wait one fucking second.
[206:41.45]Everybody stay there for a minute.
[206:43.11]I'm about to be very angry.
[206:45.77]How... Many chapters...
[206:53.19]In the evil within too If this fucking 10 Okay So there there are apparently 17 chapters in this game
[207:20.59]Why would you have 17 chapters?
[207:25.41]17?
[207:26.01]Why wouldn't you do like 15 or 10 or, why have that many?
[207:29.90]Is this a book?
[207:31.94]I've read books that don't have 17 chapters.
[207:36.74]It should be like eight or like five.
[207:40.41]Split it up into acts.
[207:42.05]What chapters are they talking about?
[207:43.89]What happened in the first four chapters?
[207:47.13]There were four chapters worth of stuff.
[207:50.61]What were they?
[207:53.11]I'm in a wheelchair and I got wheeled into a room and there's a bathtub.
[207:56.65]Now I'm in like the Matrix.
[207:59.33]And my daughter is running around.
[208:01.23]Four chapters have gone by.
[208:02.75]I have 25 weapon parts.
[208:12.94]The chairman is getting triggered.
[208:14.70]He's triggered.
[208:18.48]Oh, no.
[208:19.98]Oh, he can't.
[208:20.51]Never mind.
[208:20.81]He can't even attack him.
[208:22.47]Hey, I left somebody in the chat just went, chill out, man.
[208:26.95]I'm just kidding around.
[208:27.93]Don't worry.
[208:28.35]Or am I?
[208:28.69]I might not.
[208:32.71]Let's just go to this next thing.
[208:33.95]Find the entrance to the Morrow in the North City.
[208:44.47]Wasn't I already there?
[208:47.01]I thought I was already at the Morrow.
[209:11.21]Um... So there's two things I'm gonna give you here.
[209:15.60]Resident Evil 7 came out this year.
[209:17.76]And this.
[209:18.62]And both were made by, like, certain people, like, obviously this was made by one of the original Resident Evil guys.
[209:24.19]The experience I had in Resident Evil 7... I mean, obviously I played it in VR, but just like the video game Resident Evil 7, like, the first, like, six hours of Resident Evil 7 is fan-fucking-tastic.
[209:38.67]This is not even close to being as fun as Resident Evil 7's first like four or five hours.
[209:42.17]Not even close.
[209:49.81]They're on different continents.
[209:58.28]You want me to see Metro 2033?
[210:03.54]I actually want to play Metro.
[210:04.98]I think it'd be fun.
[210:07.25]How many chapters?
[210:07.85]We're currently in chapter 5, right?
[210:10.07]Or chapter 4.
[210:14.52]But, you talk about the two major, like, major survival horror games that came out this year.
[210:19.02]This one and... 7.
[210:22.04]I had some complaints about 7.
[210:26.32]A lot.
[210:26.62]Especially, like, at the end of the game.
[210:29.14]That, like, last two-thirds of Resident Evil 7 was just, like, a chore.
[210:33.25]But the first, like, 10 to 15 hours of Resident Evil 7, the first, no, not 10 to 15, the first, like, six, were wonderful.
[210:44.06]Get out of here, rats!
[210:47.64]Outlast 2, and I didn't like Outlast 2 either.
[210:52.90]We played it through the whole... Do I have a fucking axe?
[210:57.61]Yes, I do.
[210:59.87]We... I played through all of Outlast 2 on stream.
[211:04.63]And it was kind of just mediocre.
[211:09.42]First 100 hours of Resident Evil 7 are where it really shines.
[211:15.62]This game is basically Outlast 2.
[211:18.18]No, this game is like... This game is like a GTA side mission.
[211:24.05]That they made and you do it like a hundred times in a row.
[211:28.56]I can imagine, like, a DLC, like, a GTA Online, like, minigame.
[211:43.63]Like, I would be okay if this was, if this was, like, a GTA 5 side content.
[211:49.02]Like, they made, like, a joke about zombie survival and you have to, like, go collect, like, some items and shit.
[211:52.74]God damn it.
[211:53.28]There's, like, a fucking giant pus enemy over here.
[211:58.06]Why won't you stop playing it?
[212:01.36]Because this is all I'm doing tonight.
[212:02.96]I'm not going to start playing something else.
[212:04.86]I'm kind of in too deep at this point to start anything else.
[212:10.36]The term in too deep fully explains why you're still seeing this game.
[212:23.68]Somebody's having sex in this car.
[212:26.44]I feel like a cop.
[212:27.70]Let's go investigate.
[212:29.72]Excuse me, what are you doing on make-out point?
[212:44.27]Or somebody's changing their oil.
[212:49.29]Funny stuff.
[212:50.96]Funny stuff.
[213:02.58]Why are you not running?
[213:03.78]Oh my god.
[213:05.44]I need some kind of device.
[213:09.67]I need to get a device to open the door over here.
[213:14.56]Please turn on the electricity to get in the door.
[213:16.94]Please run around the side of the building and press the button you need to press.
[213:37.37]I need to, like, craft some things.
[213:38.83]I'm not in a safe place, though.
[213:41.95]Whatever.
[213:44.05]Safe enough.
[213:47.85]Field crafting.
[213:48.60]Let's do it.
[213:59.47]Uh, med kit.
[214:00.89]I can't even make anything.
[214:01.73]I can make one shotgun shell.
[214:14.30]I'm trying to speedrun when he said nobody could.
[214:16.24]I'm not trying to speedrun.
[214:20.68]Where am I?
[214:23.02]No, I'm not trying to speedrun.
[214:24.09]I'm just trying to like hold my pee in because I just had to go real bad right now.
[214:31.24]Is out here.
[214:31.74]I have to be so bad.
[214:38.33]It's a bleed run.
[214:44.01]It's a fence.
[214:45.37]What do I have to do?
[214:46.71]Disable the radio frequency?
[214:48.09]I don't even know what I need to do.
[214:49.09]But I need to kill that spitter.
[214:55.13]This person has to die.
[214:56.19]I don't know what the fuck he wanted me to do.
[214:59.83]I was too busy like
[215:04.09]Shoot it right in the fucking face.
[215:05.23]Oh shit, I was trying to get him.
[215:26.44]Okay, now can I like investigate the roof of the house without anybody attacking me?
[215:32.49]No, no, no.
[215:35.45]Get out of here.
[215:36.45]Fuck off.
[215:38.42]Investigate what's under the car.
[215:39.78]Oh, I almost got jump scared by that guy.
[215:41.74]It's a potted plant.
[215:43.74]My favorite.
[215:50.16]That looks skinny.
[215:55.82]Don't tell me about the fucking sitting in wheelchairs.
[215:57.30]I have a fuse, right?
[215:57.72]What are you talking about?
[215:58.58]I missed a cross.
[215:59.46]I look sick, I am sick.
[215:59.98]Thank you for noticing.
[216:23.57]Look ammo for the gun italics.
[216:24.87]Do you like this game?
[216:25.61]All right, everybody base your opinion on italics as a human being if he says he like loves this game We're waiting we're all waiting
[216:54.59]Your first four hours were a solid 8 out of 10.
[216:56.21]This game is a 2 out of 10.
[216:57.31]This is by far the worst release of 2017.
[217:03.47]And I'm not even making that up.
[217:05.87]At least for me.
[217:14.04]Get him out of here!
[217:17.76]Oh, look, there's a coffee in there.
[217:27.38]I don't hate this game, 2 out of 10.
[217:29.14]Enhance!
[217:43.55]Enhance it!
[217:50.37]To be fair, you have to have pretty high IQ to understand.
[218:04.44]Warden Crossbow.
[218:25.84]I need to be good.
[218:29.11]To walk around an empty open world game.
[218:32.75]A fucking empty open world game with some zombies that, like, are impossible to kill.
[218:40.06]To watch a cutscene.
[218:44.10]Cutscenes aren't even very good.
[218:45.52]And there's no scares.
[218:48.07]The scares are the cutscenes.
[218:51.07]It's a solid three and a half out of ten.
[218:55.43]And I'm gonna kick that over.
[218:56.67]Because I don't like it.
[219:04.64]Baby rage.
[219:07.12]Can I like fucking just break this shit?
[219:09.02]I'm sure I can.
[219:17.23]This is not even a good survival game.
[219:19.41]This is not even a good survival game.
[219:22.97]It's just an empty boring fucking game.
[219:26.80]Like look, this is one enemy here.
[219:28.34]And she's gonna chase me around.
[219:32.18]She kills you in like two hits.
[219:36.06]And then I have to go turn on a radio and watch a cutscene.
[219:43.77]Where is anything?
[219:45.81]There's like a guy right there.
[219:47.59]And the fucking world is like upside down.
[219:57.22]Oh no, this person has an axe!
[220:04.98]I better go out of the back of this truck and pick up items.
[220:32.59]That's the worst game to come out for 2017 for me.
[220:35.03]Without a doubt.
[220:42.96]I ain't fucking walking around aimlessly to watch cutscenes and follow a little girl around.
[221:00.28]Hold tight.
[221:05.25]Where were the scares?
[221:06.45]Where was the scary shit?
[221:08.12]There was nothing scary in the Evil Within 2.
[221:10.60]They showed a cutscene of somebody doing something scary and then you get control of the character to walk to the next cutscene.
[221:20.34]How is this game an eight and a half out of ten?
[221:25.36]And there's a crafting system like in every other fucking video game.
[221:32.86]I didn't make it to the scare.
[221:34.17]I was in chapter fucking four.
[221:38.29]I was in the fourth chapter of the game.
[221:41.59]Huh?
[221:44.58]Huh?
[221:49.54]If you gotta wait like until like five or six chapters into your game to like scare me
[222:06.08]Maybe I'm just fucking old.
[222:11.39]Did you say crafting?
[222:13.79]Yeah, four, guess what?
[222:15.59]We were in chapter four of 17.
[222:17.19]This game gets a four out of 17 for me.
[222:20.73]That's the score of the game is where we ended up in the chapter selection.
[222:26.17]You like my hair?
[222:26.69]Thanks, appreciate it.
[222:30.96]Yeah.
[222:32.26]Hey, do the math.
[222:41.05]$250 joke just solution play dead space But that dead space was like fucking crazy Like I might have a fucking staunch opinion on this but but like for real I Don't know man that didn't that just that just did not do it for me Let me just make this like bigger so I get my actually like a streaming still I
[223:13.88]If you disagree with me, then you do.
[223:15.14]And then you disagree.
[223:17.20]All I can tell you is how I feel.
[223:19.04]That's how I feel.
[223:25.25]I want to do something else.
[223:28.75]Hey.
[223:30.11]Guess what?
[223:32.63]Guess what we're going to play for the next hour.
[223:35.04]Or the next 40 minutes.
[223:41.14]You'll see.
[223:44.23]Jeremy, Mr. President, what does that mean?
[223:47.51]You'll find out.
