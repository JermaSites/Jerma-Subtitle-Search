[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.93]Alright, well, for the purposes, this is the only thing I can literally open right now.
[00:08.50]I swear to God.
[00:11.00]I'm not even making a dumb joke here, this is actually the only thing I can open right now.
[00:24.57]It's either this or Resident Evil Revelations 2.
[00:27.85]And I ain't ready to start that, because we're like three hours into the stream.
[00:34.38]This is also at a lower resolution than it was yesterday.
[00:50.98]So, I'm not sure what to do here.
[00:55.10]Play Life is Strange?
[00:56.56]No, I'm not going to play Life is Strange right now.
[01:03.56]How's the new one?
[01:04.16]Is the new one any good?
[01:09.30]Probably should change the title of the game, because it's current... Well, actually, it is currently open.
[01:13.99]Just crashed behind me, and I can't close it.
[01:15.79]So, it's true.
[01:24.69]I still am technically playing Deadly Premonition.
[01:32.22]What happened?
[01:32.62]I was gone for five minutes?
[01:33.48]I'll get you up to speed here.
[01:35.68]So, uh, deadly premonition hard crashed and I can't physically close it.
[01:40.46]I'm gonna have to turn my computer off to close the game.
[01:46.38]Unmute the voiceover.
[01:47.94]Do you really want to hear that shit?
[01:52.29]If you really want to hear it, I'll put it on.
[02:02.73]Uh, task manager did nothing either.
[02:04.17]I cannot close the game.
[02:05.25]It took over my whole computer.
[02:11.30]Alright, get us up there nice and easy.
[02:21.17]Eh, that's not nice and easy.
[02:22.25]I fucking blew it.
[02:26.14]Just end the process.
[02:27.14]Can't do it.
[02:28.40]Tried it.
[02:29.60]My task manager is not even... I can't even access it.
[02:31.55]Can't use it.
[02:32.93]Build a new computer.
[02:34.55]What should have happened is... Deadly Premonition should not have released on Steam in 2013.
[02:39.75]Which, that's the year it was released on Steam.
[02:43.73]In a state that is that terrible.
[02:47.04]That's the real opinion.
[02:54.08]That's the real opinion.
[02:57.98]Should have put more Vaseline on my body.
[03:00.61]Uh, now I have to get over it?
[03:05.37]No, you know, hold on.
[03:08.05]Let's see if I can do this.
[03:13.31]Yeah, I'm holding down.
[03:15.47]I'm trying to just, there's no way.
[03:17.03]I can't exit it.
[03:18.53]I can't do it.
[03:20.61]It's such a bust.
[03:22.27]Install DP fix.
[03:25.97]Maybe another day.
[03:29.97]I almost just hit the X on... I can't.
[03:33.76]Yeah.
[03:35.42]The only way I'm going to be able to open Deadly Premonition again is if my computer turns off.
[03:41.46]So we can't do that again today.
[03:43.40]Not today.
[03:46.61]And now I've lost access to getting over it.
[03:48.43]There we go.
[03:59.07]I can't wait to do the Christmas light decoration stream.
[04:02.19]It's going to be so much fun.
[04:04.75]You guys are going to love it.
[04:07.91]Resident Evil Revelations 2 is co-op, but I don't think the campaign is co-op.
[04:11.85]I think it's just like a weird fight the waves of zombies mode.
[04:17.24]It's not really a... Oh, wow, like campaign co-op.
[04:23.01]This is not something I was prepared to do today either.
[04:24.81]So I'm really like phoning in this part of the stream here.
[04:27.83]I'm sorry.
[04:28.53]I'm just going to be real.
[04:31.33]Yesterday, this was like the stream.
[04:32.97]This was the stream yesterday.
[04:34.22]And now I'm just phoning this in.
[04:36.54]I don't want to phone it in.
[04:37.62]I don't want to do that.
[04:49.61]There we go.
[04:54.22]I can't believe I'm getting phoned in right now.
[05:02.16]I'm not phoning it in.
[05:03.60]I ain't gonna phone it in.
[05:04.64]Quit the game.
[05:05.48]You're not gonna get a phoned in fucking stream from me.
[05:13.32]It's not happening.
[05:14.86]I'll switch to IRL for like fucking 30 minutes.
[05:19.64]I can't even do that.
[05:21.04]Oh yeah I can.
[05:21.70]I can do this.
[05:26.07]What happened to the lighting in here?
[05:33.07]What am I moving around?
[05:33.93]Oh, it's this stupid fucking thing.
[05:41.69]Let me move this.
[05:42.48]My PC's dying.
[05:53.48]No, my PC's fine.
[05:59.69]My PC's fine.
[06:00.97]Jesus!
[06:01.49]Oh, my God!
[06:07.50]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[06:10.66]I got a joke for you.
[06:11.48]I got a fucking, I got a joke for you guys.
[06:32.86]Check this one out.
[06:43.65]It's not a Star Wars joke.
[06:44.97]That's not a Star Wars joke.
[06:47.31]This is the ad.
[06:51.03]You're gonna like this one.
[06:55.23]I'm gonna get a lot of thumbs up for this one.
[07:02.01]Alright, so, like, imagine... Imagine if, like, somebody was streaming it during, like, the end of the world, like, the apocalypse or something.
[07:09.31]And, like, the countdown, the countdown for when, like, the sun burns out is, like, oh, no.
[07:13.06]Hey, thanks for watching, everybody.
[07:14.70]I really appreciate it.
[07:16.86]But we only got, like, fucking 30 seconds before the sun burns out.
[07:20.44]End of the world.
[07:21.18]Thanks for watching.
[07:22.52]Oh, by the way, thank you to, uh, MikeTT11 for the $5.
[07:27.17]Thank you.
[07:27.51]I appreciate that.
[07:29.10]And here comes the countdown.
[07:30.06]We've got 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4... Oh, it happened early!
[07:37.12]It happened early!
[07:37.94]Oh, shit!
[07:38.48]Thank you to Mike185 for the $5.
[07:39.94]I appreciate it.
[07:51.05]And...
[07:58.10]Thanks for the bits, Dan1185, Super Raptor.
[08:05.29]And it's over, we're good.
[08:16.02]Why is it brighter when the sun burns out?
[08:18.76]Now that's a good question, because the sun's exploding into the room and killing me.
[08:24.68]What is this face?
[08:25.42]Why am I all red?
[08:27.69]What happened?
[08:36.40]Wait, where did I joke about a... No, that was the sun burning out.
[08:44.66]Only true heroes thank subs during the fucking apocalypse.
[08:47.74]That's true.
[08:48.34]That's very true.
[08:49.84]Let me like fix this.
[08:52.08]On our fucking hangout stream.
[08:55.90]There we go.
[08:56.44]Like I said, I'm not like a red person.
[08:58.04]I'm not like... I'm not like... I don't have a sunburn, I promise.
[09:04.53]I'm just ugly.
[09:06.03]You know what I'm saying?
[09:08.53]Alright, what are we gonna do now?
[09:11.79]What do I do for like the fucking rest of the stream?
[09:14.42]Do I just have to sit here?
[09:16.04]And change it to IRL and do nothing?
[09:19.36]There has to be something I can do.
[09:20.30]Hold on, let me like... Let's get this on like a good IRL streamer camera, right?
[09:25.01]Let's get this in, like, a better position.
[09:26.15]So this is, like, this is, you can see out my window.
[09:27.61]This is a good, like, IRL stream.
[09:29.23]Let me, like, fucking do this.
[09:32.04]It's been a little sweaty down here.
[09:33.94]It's been just a little sweaty.
[09:35.06]Just a little bit.
[09:37.12]Alright, let's, um... What do I want to do?
[09:42.46]It needs to be pointed down more.
[09:44.82]Why would I need to point it down?
[09:48.84]I think it's fine just the way it is.
[09:52.59]Oh, I forgot.
[09:53.17]Hey guys, I'd love to do something.
[09:55.53]I would love to put something on my main screen right here.
[09:59.07]But as you can see, the current situation is this is what I get to see.
[10:11.28]Don Cucino.
[10:13.44]This is my monitor right now.
[10:21.59]Cool.
[10:24.54]Clean my room?
[10:25.44]My room is perpetually messy because I continue to fucking ruin it on stream.
[10:30.64]Why would I clean my room when I'm just going to destroy it?
[10:36.84]Dirty monitor?
[10:39.30]You're gonna give me shit for a dirty monitor?
[10:40.94]Did you see the stream where we like threw paint everywhere and like drop stuff all over the ground and dump water and shit on the ground?
[10:48.58]We put a bunch of shit on the ground.
[10:50.40]Painted on the ground.
[10:51.96]Nothing even came in this area.
[10:53.52]Nothing even close to this part of the room.
[10:59.88]Christmas destruction confirmed.
[11:01.06]I'm not destroying my room for Christmas.
[11:03.06]I promise.
[11:05.83]That's not going to happen.
[11:07.31]I'm not destroying the room for Christmas.
[11:09.69]What I am going to do is... See up here?
[11:12.64]Like, I'm gonna, all this, this whole wall is gonna be taken.
[11:16.42]Let me change this to IRL so I'm not a fucking dickhead.
[11:18.51]I'm just gonna write, like, computer frozen.
[11:24.85]Let's hang out for a little bit.
[11:34.49]Uh, IRL.
[11:35.03]Oh, it's already changed.
[11:36.18]It's already changed.
[11:36.86]Look at that.
[11:38.70]Okay.
[11:39.36]Well, here we go.
[11:44.50]I've used tissues.
[11:45.98]What are you talking about?
[11:48.54]Am I going to dress up as Santa Claus?
[11:50.02]No.
[11:51.56]That's not going to happen.
[11:52.32]I'm not going to dress up as Santa.
[11:54.34]I am going to decorate the room with various Christmas gear.
[11:59.82]So there'll be various lights.
[12:01.82]There'll be some candles.
[12:03.80]There'll be some candy canes.
[12:07.32]When am I going to get a haircut?
[12:08.55]Whenever I feel like it.
[12:11.01]Soon.
[12:11.27]I don't know.
[12:12.57]Who cares?
[12:15.30]I'm not going to clean the monitor, no.
[12:19.84]On the windows.
[12:22.92]What's on the windows?
[12:26.82]No, you're talking about that little thing?
[12:28.90]You're talking about this little thing?
[12:31.82]How would you even see this shit?
[12:34.02]I don't even understand, guys.
[12:35.34]I really don't.
[12:37.91]What's back there?
[12:39.61]What's back there right now?
[12:41.07]Can you see?
[12:43.07]Why would you even know what that was?
[12:44.27]Why would you even care?
[12:48.25]That's a bottle of air duster, a webcam, a pair of scissors, a Yankee candle, a PlayStation 3, and a box for a fan.
[13:04.11]I don't get it.
[13:05.61]Balding in real time.
[13:06.79]Yeah, it is.
[13:08.65]I know you're talking about that right there.
[13:11.05]I don't know what that is.
[13:11.83]I don't know what half the stuff in my room is.
[13:16.52]But there's like...
[13:19.87]This is like these are like Reese's wrappers from like probably three weeks ago I'm not dirty.
[13:28.77]I'm just messy Let's get that really clear right now Let's get that look let's really throw this out there and get all of our eggs on the table Put all of our eggs on the table.
[13:39.13]I'm not dirty I'm messy.
[13:43.47]I'm messy.
[13:44.05]I'm not dirty dirty is different.
[13:45.94]I
[13:47.03]Dirty is disgusting.
[13:48.25]Dirty is like gross.
[13:49.53]Messy is just kind of like disheveled.
[13:52.73]You know, it's just shit everywhere.
[13:54.27]A little sloppy.
[13:59.01]No, nothing's going to break on the Christmas.
[14:00.99]Okay, you want to hear a guarantee?
[14:02.64]You want to hear a Dunkachino guarantee?
[14:07.34]There will be no... I will not break one thing on the Christmas decoration stream.
[14:11.40]There's not going to be anything.
[14:12.08]Nothing's going to break.
[14:13.76]I promise.
[14:15.25]We're going to listen to fucking Christmas music.
[14:17.37]We're going to hang out.
[14:18.12]We're going to tell some stories.
[14:18.94]We're going to have some hot chocolate.
[14:20.24]And I'm going to decorate the room and it'll be fun.
[14:23.70]It'll be a nice little hangout thing.
[14:28.68]Bullshit.
[14:29.20]That's fine.
[14:30.14]You can think it's bullshit.
[14:31.12]But I'll see you in like a week when it happens.
[14:34.85]Because I've got to get a bunch of cool shit.
[14:41.17]What if we want things to break?
[14:44.81]Well, then that's what you want, but that's not what you're going to get.
[14:50.39]Let me make it a little more Christmassy in here right now.
[14:54.13]Here's what I'm going to do.
[14:56.18]I'm going to go like this.
[14:58.24]We're going to play back-to-back-to-back jacks.
[15:00.42]We're going to play only Christmas music.
[15:02.90]Sword of the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[15:07.30]Jingle Bells.
[15:13.99]What's another Christmas song?
[15:14.97]I'm not Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.
[15:24.69]That's not a Christmas song.
[15:28.49]Why not Christmas music?
[15:29.75]Why don't you want Christmas music?
[15:34.90]Nothing's going to break.
[15:36.64]Nothing will break.
[15:37.88]Guaranteed.
[15:38.38]Here we go.
[15:39.16]This is how it's going to start.
[15:42.49]Imagine, like, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer playing.
[15:45.31]And the room's gonna look like this.
[15:48.41]We got a little bit of green here.
[15:51.40]Get some red in there, too.
[15:55.48]Look at that!
[15:56.78]Look at that!
[15:57.50]Already!
[15:58.28]Already we got the Christmas vibe in here.
[16:00.18]We got green.
[16:01.36]We got red.
[16:02.02]There's gonna be lights.
[16:04.14]Cameras.
[16:06.74]It's gonna be fantastic.
[16:08.12]I can't wait.
[16:12.57]What's wrong with this?
[16:15.80]Production quality?
[16:16.86]Yes, there will be production quality.
[16:20.64]What about this one?
[16:21.32]See?
[16:21.80]What if I change him up a little?
[16:23.36]It doesn't have to be the same thing.
[16:24.57]It can be different every time.
[16:30.73]I don't know how to do this, though.
[16:31.67]How do I split this again?
[16:35.22]I fucked it up.
[16:42.95]It could be snowy in here.
[16:45.73]Check this out.
[16:46.37]I could do a little snowy, icy thing where I make it like this and everything's really chilly and cool.
[16:52.88]I like that.
[16:53.34]I look like I'm in Jason Statham.
[16:55.72]I look like I'm in a Jason Statham.
[16:59.80]You know those movies where his heart's going to explode so he has to keep punching people in the mouth so his heart doesn't explode?
[17:07.59]Is it called Crank Anchors?
[17:10.49]Here we go.
[17:10.77]There's this one.
[17:11.81]We can do blue and red.
[17:13.17]This is very much like a Frosty the Snowman look.
[17:16.31]I like this.
[17:17.53]We can do like my channel.
[17:20.05]Let's do my channel art here.
[17:26.51]Here's that.
[17:30.67]This one needs to be a little more green.
[17:32.05]There we go.
[17:35.23]We've got the Jerma985 channel art colors.
[17:39.06]Let's try this.
[17:39.98]This might look a little better.
[17:45.62]I'm not going to spill hot chocolate.
[17:48.40]Give me a little bit of credit.
[17:50.24]Not every stream has to be a destroy everything stream.
[17:53.72]This is a Philips Hue.
[17:55.04]I'm glad somebody picked up on that.
[17:56.70]Philips Hue.
[18:01.20]This is nice.
[18:02.18]I like this.
[18:03.60]I do actually like this.
[18:05.04]It's not a joke.
[18:06.68]It feels nice.
[18:10.10]Destroy the meme stream.
[18:11.20]That's happening soon.
[18:12.94]And by soon, I mean, I don't know, whenever I feel like it, because I'm a fucking lazy piece of shit.
[18:18.08]I read bits.
[18:18.80]That's another thing I got to do.
[18:19.82]What the fuck is this?
[18:30.13]No.
[18:31.05]I don't know.
[18:32.41]Fucking bills.
[18:34.55]They ain't getting any more money from me.
[18:37.16]You're not getting any more money from me.
[18:39.26]Bills, huh?
[18:40.48]You're going to have to shut me off.
[18:42.36]I ain't fucking paying another fucking cent to the electric, I'll tell you that.
[18:50.01]Rewind.
[18:52.15]Fucking bills, huh?
[18:53.87]Bills, yeah.
[18:55.05]Got bills everywhere.
[18:56.17]Lined up everywhere.
[18:57.03]Fucking two bills here too.
[18:58.41]I ain't paying another cent to the electric, I can guarantee you.
[19:19.99]Was it a bill?
[19:21.31]Whatever, electric bill.
[19:24.27]Fucking Xbox bill.
[19:25.59]It's all bills here.
[19:26.59]It's so annoying.
[19:27.89]You know what?
[19:29.35]I ain't paying anymore.
[19:30.81]I ain't gonna pay another bill.
[19:32.09]In fact, my electric is like fucking four and a half days overdue.
[19:36.81]Oh boy, there we finally got the fucking joke.
[19:55.39]That light was even still on god damn it.
[19:58.49]Oh I'm fucking getting this joke.
[19:59.99]I don't care what it takes.
[20:01.21]I have to unscrew this light bulb Hey, hey guys How many fucking idiots does it take to screw in a light bulb let's find out Hey
[20:16.37]How many dummy idiots does it take to unscrew a light bulb?
[20:19.33]I can't reach it.
[20:31.67]That's going to be really hot though.
[20:33.47]I don't think I want to do that.
[20:35.62]In fact, I'm not going to do that.
[20:37.92]Sorry.
[20:40.80]It's the ceiling.
[20:42.48]Give me a break.
[20:45.05]I'm doing that joke.
[20:45.92]I don't care.
[20:46.36]Hold on.
[20:48.44]Just wait.
[20:49.02]One second.
[20:49.78]I need to do this.
[20:51.00]I have to turn the webcam off, otherwise I'm wearing a weird pair of pants and I don't want you to see what they are.
[20:57.34]They're too fucking weird.
[20:58.23]Alright, here we go.
[21:05.03]I'm like... Is it hot?
[21:10.00]Yeah, it's good.
[21:10.86]It's good.
[21:11.18]I got it.
[21:12.82]Ooh, it is hot.
[21:15.12]Oh, it's hot.
[21:15.78]Oh, it's hot.
[21:17.28]Oh, it's hot.
[21:17.90]Okay, I'm good.
[21:20.80]I almost just fucking fell and landed on the computer.
[21:24.82]That would have been so awful.
[21:28.84]Okay.
[21:30.36]I'm going to do this joke for real.
[21:31.88]And we're going to get it.
[21:32.62]It's going to happen.
[21:33.86]It's not going to be bullshit.
[21:34.90]It's not going to be... I'm not going to fuck it up.
[21:37.18]So make sure when you're watching this VOD, you've already skipped.
[21:40.64]And there's like... Why is there like dust all over my hand?
[21:46.42]Okay, here we go.
[21:50.77]In fact, hold on.
[21:54.31]And, like, Callum, when you're, like, putting this together, if you're actually gonna, like, edit this video, add, like, a boom when the lights turn off.
[22:04.63]Yeah, this reminds me, fucking, I haven't paid my bills in a long time.
[22:12.64]It's been at least, like,
[22:14.98]It's been, like, at least six months since I've even paid my car insurance, let alone anything else.
[22:19.90]Like, honest to God, I don't think I've even paid my electric bill.
[22:26.35]Oh, and there!
[22:28.03]There she blows!
[22:38.19]We did it!
[22:38.57]What the fuck am I doing right now?
[22:41.73]What am I doing?
[22:42.45]What am I doing?
[22:49.15]So good.
[22:50.35]Fades out.
[22:51.03]It's just a fade out.
[22:52.85]It's not even actually like a fuck.
[22:54.21]Yeah, whatever.
[22:55.71]Wouldn't the stream turn off too though?
[23:00.57]Yes.
[23:01.33]Yes, the stream would in fact turn off too.
[23:04.15]That's the funny part.
[23:07.56]Ding.
[23:08.18]Doing.
[23:12.14]Show us the Garfield pants.
[23:15.18]I'm wearing weird fucking pants right now.
[23:17.18]You guys are not going to see them.
[23:22.15]Fucking jeans.
[23:23.41]Calm down.
[23:26.97]Hey.
[23:31.21]You ever seen somebody do this one before?
[23:32.39]Doesn't look like a thumb.
[23:42.31]Oh boy.
[23:42.81]Hey, excuse me.
[23:43.96]A little magic trick for you.
[23:46.56]Oh, fucking ooh.
[23:48.72]Never seen anybody do a trick like that before.
[23:52.57]How do you actually do it?
[23:53.53]You go like this, right?
[23:56.94]Like this?
[23:59.76]Yeah, like that.
[24:00.20]There we go.
[24:02.26]Magic trick for you guys.
[24:03.28]Show this to your fucking friends at school.
[24:05.87]Take your index finger, go like this, tightly over your thumb.
[24:12.63]Take your other hand, make a fist, and make it look like your thumb is sticking out a little bit, and you want to link them together like that.
[24:18.96]So it looks like you're very, very tightly gripping the thumb on this hand.
[24:23.88]See?
[24:25.74]And you can be like, yeah, it's not a big deal.
[24:27.83]I'm just grabbing my thumb like this, right?
[24:30.01]Give it a wiggle.
[24:30.85]Make sure the audience knows that it's real, like this.
[24:35.77]Check this one out.
[24:37.35]Wow.
[24:38.35]What happened to the guy's fucking thumb?
[24:39.97]Holy shit.
[24:42.05]You're gonna make somebody across the table spit their fucking drink out.
[24:45.35]Someone's gonna go to the hospital.
[24:46.54]Like, they're gonna choke and they can't fucking even possibly understand how you did that.
[24:52.88]And then at the very end, you have to credit me.
[24:54.28]You have to say, I learned that trick from jermaOn 8-5 Elbertson, trademark 2017 thumb trick.
[25:01.59]You have to say that out loud.
[25:02.49]Otherwise, my lawyers will fucking end you.
[25:05.41]It'll be fucking terrible for you.
[25:07.75]You'll lose everything.
[25:08.49]I'll come after you with everything I have.
[25:10.23]And I have a lot.
[25:11.72]As you can probably guess, 55 fucking thousand bitcoins.
[25:16.56]Yeah.
[25:24.06]I learned that trick from my dad when I was eight.
[25:25.76]Everybody learned that trick from their dad when they were eight.
[25:32.83]What's your opinion on the latest Ready Player One trailer?
[25:39.21]I don't know what that is.
[25:43.35]I don't know what that is.
[25:46.27]I know it's a movie, right?
[25:48.53]It's a movie with, let me guess, let me guess, let me guess.
[25:51.85]Uh, Ryan Reynolds.
[25:53.65]And... Selma Hayek.
[25:56.87]And... Um... John Lovitz?
[26:02.70]Is... John Lovitz.
[26:06.96]John Lovitz is probably in that movie.
[26:13.96]Oh, the bits!
[26:14.42]The bits!
[26:14.70]Right, right, right.
[26:15.18]Bits, bits, bits.
[26:15.82]Let me, like, focus on the bits.
[26:18.42]Holy shit, there are a lot of bits.
[26:19.94]Holy shit.
[26:22.11]Alright, let me see here.
[26:23.69]What did I actually like?
[26:24.87]I missed a lot because I'm a piece of crap.
[26:27.83]And well, actually, it's because I couldn't alt tab and I still can't.
[26:31.41]But I can read from here.
[26:33.52]Let's go ahead and do let's go.
[26:34.36]Let's do like a bit reading questions and answers answer stream.
[26:38.32]Here we go.
[26:45.82]No, I don't want to do that.
[26:46.89]I'm just kidding.
[26:47.33]I'm kidding.
[26:47.69]It's a joke.
[26:48.09]It was a joke.
[26:50.63]Thank you to... Where did I leave off here?
[26:54.73]LaFurl, thanks for the $1.
[26:55.93]Fuck the Oscars.
[26:58.17]That guy was a character.
[26:59.45]I know what he's talking about.
[27:00.69]I know exactly what video he's talking about.
[27:03.59]That dude was all over the place.
[27:04.89]That was one of the weirdest fucking things I've ever seen.
[27:06.76]It was hilarious, though.
[27:09.10]Thank you, LaFurl.
[27:09.82]Thank you, Tato.
[27:12.71]Thank you, Tato.
[27:13.81]From earlier.
[27:14.85]I missed referrals, but I did see, uh, Tato's.
[27:16.93]Thank you, Tay.
[27:19.05]Uh, Time, that was the $50 donation from Time.
[27:21.42]Thank you so much, dude.
[27:22.28]That's a lot of fucking money.
[27:23.70]And then MooMeansMoo, $5.
[27:26.42]Derby, you're killing me.
[27:28.00]I have to go to school.
[27:28.84]Why must you do this to me?
[27:30.00]I remember recommending this game to you, like, over a year ago.
[27:33.53]So I'm looking forward to being a dirty VOD boy.
[27:37.11]Well, I'm sorry that we're all dirty VOD boys now because nobody can even fucking, we can't even play it.
[27:42.19]It doesn't even work.
[27:43.64]I opened up a door and the game stopped working and broke my computer.
[27:47.80]And made one of my fucking light bulbs go out.
[27:52.87]Nice director's cut.
[27:54.83]Thanks, Capcom.
[27:58.22]Thank you, though.
[27:59.44]Klosky, thank you for the $5.
[28:00.58]Sorry I called you a dirty bit streamer.
[28:02.74]Love you.
[28:03.16]I was just watching your old TF2 vids.
[28:05.72]Keep up the great content.
[28:07.10]Well, thank you.
[28:09.31]Those are some of those videos.
[28:10.35]They're very, very, very deeply rooted in the heart here.
[28:13.89]They're in here somewhere.
[28:14.71]They're deep in there.
[28:15.71]My cold Grinch heart.
[28:18.75]Those videos, I have a lot of... I had a lot of fun making those videos.
[28:24.31]I'm glad people still can enjoy them.
[28:25.83]Obviously, right?
[28:28.29]Night Fang, thanks for the $1.
[28:29.75]When am I gonna play Knack 2?
[28:32.63]I'm never gonna play Knack 2, and I'm never gonna play Knack 1.
[28:37.59]Sorry.
[28:39.15]Thank you, though.
[28:41.17]Eesthee, thanks for the $15.
[28:43.15]I'm butchering this name.
[28:46.30]Thank you, Eesthee, for the $15.
[28:47.72]Here is the 15 bits EU people must pay every stream to keep these EU times alive.
[28:55.48]Well, that, look, you know, let me get a little taller here.
[28:59.60]Look, you don't have to do that.
[29:01.71]Bits for EU times.
[29:04.25]Something you have to remember here.
[29:05.55]This is really important to remember, and I'm going to be really, really super clear about it.
[29:10.09]My sleep schedule and how I work, and when I say work, I mean like my body and my brain.
[29:19.87]I can't do, like, these streams all the time.
[29:22.79]I'm at my most alert at, like, 8 or 9 o'clock at night, Eastern Time, every day.
[29:27.58]So, if I do a stream that's at, like, 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, my time... Like, I started this one at, what, like, 1?
[29:34.00]12.30?
[29:34.76]Whenever it was, my time.
[29:37.82]I'm still, like, fucked up.
[29:39.93]Like, I'm not ready to go.
[29:40.95]My, like, brain is like, oh, it's... I'm slow...
[29:44.13]I'm just, I'm a super night person.
[29:46.81]So I can't do day streams.
[29:49.73]I just can't do them.
[29:52.45]That's why we have to pay money.
[29:53.59]No, no, don't do that.
[29:56.61]You don't have to do that.
[29:57.33]1.15, okay, yeah.
[30:00.68]I'm just wondering, do you live in the fictional world described in, I don't even know what that is.
[30:10.06]I live in the real world, man.
[30:11.64]Matrix, I got unplugged a long time ago.
[30:15.60]I'm looking down right now from a spaceship and I'm seeing this life that I'm living here.
[30:20.43]I plugged back in.
[30:21.23]It's not pretty.
[30:23.17]Nobody wants to be the one.
[30:24.29]Trust me.
[30:26.27]That gruel shit.
[30:27.17]That fucking gruel shit that you have to eat every day.
[30:29.30]It's like pig slop.
[30:31.02]No thanks.
[30:37.83]Anyways, thank you to Easty.
[30:41.17]Thank you so much for the 15 bucks.
[30:43.13]Bisk, thank you for the 69 cents.
[30:44.87]Cheers, 69.
[30:45.59]That's all they say.
[30:47.27]This name is going to give me some trouble.
[30:51.51]D-Z, D-Z-I, Bill, Chow, Tun, Chun, I don't know.
[30:59.06]It's like, it's just kind of a bunch of stuff.
[31:01.92]But I'm going to call you D, I'm going to call you DBZ.
[31:03.90]Thank you, DZB, for the $1.
[31:06.34]Jeremy985, if you don't give my glue boy some proper adhesive, I will take a bullet train to your house and toss your salad.
[31:19.03]All kinds of emotions going on in that one.
[31:25.33]Thank you, though.
[31:26.63]Appreciate it.
[31:28.36]I appreciate that.
[31:31.00]SmokewiseGanja, thanks for the $5.
[31:32.48]Thanks for the EU stream, Jeremy.
[31:34.58]Monster Hunter stream with Etalyx.
[31:36.04]I can't wait for Monster Hunter.
[31:37.02]Like, the real... I don't want to play the beta.
[31:38.64]Like, everyone's like, oh, play the beta.
[31:39.74]That's something you can stream.
[31:40.56]You can do that right now.
[31:41.26]You can do that today, this weekend, or whatever.
[31:43.99]No, I want to... When I play Monster Hunter, I want to be able to play it.
[31:47.15]I don't want to have to just sit there for like a weekend beta and then crave it for two months.
[31:52.35]When is it coming out?
[31:53.01]There is no release date on PC.
[31:54.53]That's the one thing that bugs me about that.
[31:57.02]You actually have to buy that on, like, PS4.
[32:03.46]That's kind of irritating.
[32:05.50]Just put them all out at the same damn time.
[32:08.39]Watch this.
[32:09.25]The PC release probably ain't gonna be for, like, six months.
[32:11.53]I wouldn't be surprised.
[32:13.54]So I'm gonna have to play it on, um, on PS4, at least initially.
[32:16.78]They're gonna GTA 5 everybody, and it's gonna be, oh, here it comes, 60 FPS, and it's great!
[32:22.39]It came out a year later.
[32:23.65]When the, is that a bug?
[32:26.27]That's a bug.
[32:27.23]That's a fucking bug right there.
[32:28.53]That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[32:29.55]That's a floating hair.
[32:31.75]Nobody can see that.
[32:36.03]That was weird.
[32:36.61]Never mind.
[32:37.32]Fuck it.
[32:37.68]Forget it.
[32:38.78]There, there was literally, like, there it is.
[32:40.66]There it is!
[32:41.20]There it is trying to get me.
[32:42.08]What are you doing?
[32:45.04]Okay.
[32:46.06]I'm good.
[32:47.94]That was really fucking weird.
[32:49.86]Ugh.
[32:51.22]I need a fucking haircut.
[32:52.12]I do.
[32:53.14]Bad.
[32:54.36]Starting to look like a dirty mop here.
[32:58.13]Anyways, let's keep going.
[33:03.69]Insane.
[33:04.19]I'm not insane.
[33:04.71]There was actually something there that was going to land on me.
[33:07.41]It was fucking weird.
[33:11.79]Where were we?
[33:14.57]We were right here.
[33:15.64]Right here.
[33:20.52]Thank you Tay for the one dollar.
[33:21.68]Sometime after the stream, look up harp seals.
[33:24.80]They're adorable.
[33:25.62]Harp seals.
[33:29.53]Do it right now.
[33:33.27]Harp seal.
[33:37.95]No, these are those seals that look like dogs.
[33:41.13]These look like Shibu Inu puppies.
[33:47.61]Yeah, they're cute.
[33:49.01]Yeah, alright.
[33:49.59]They're pretty cute.
[33:50.35]You got me.
[33:53.59]Doesn't it bother you that it's still in your room?
[33:56.47]Yeah, it does.
[34:00.83]Wait, what are we referring to?
[34:01.57]I don't know.
[34:03.35]Thank you, Smokewise.
[34:04.23]Ganja for the $5.
[34:05.29]Thanks for the EU stream.
[34:06.69]And that was the... No, no, no.
[34:08.09]That was the Monster Hunter bit we just talked about.
[34:11.17]Yeah.
[34:12.73]Thank you, though, Smokewise.
[34:13.55]I appreciate it, man.
[34:15.19]JS 153, thanks for the 40 cents.
[34:17.81]This game sucks.
[34:19.21]Come on, the game doesn't suck.
[34:20.89]The director's cut sucks, because you would think that they would have ironed out most of those things, and I wouldn't have to go get a third-party patch from a virus website.
[34:30.50]Not saying I'd get it from a virus, I'm just saying.
[34:32.10]I'm just saying.
[34:36.38]Moifity, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[34:39.56]Will you accept Bitcoin so I can donate more, or is it just bits and bald coin?
[34:45.71]Well, I... I still don't... I still need to, like, know what the hell I'm doing with, like, the whole Bitcoin thing.
[34:51.76]But if you're serious, I have thought, like, we talked about, like, an hour ago.
[34:57.14]There was the thing in my brain thinking, oh, Bitcoin's, like, actually getting some traction.
[35:02.08]There's probably a bunch of people that have some that maybe they wouldn't have donated or would have.
[35:05.86]I'm not asking for you to give me Bitcoin.
[35:08.15]Like, that's not what this is.
[35:10.27]I just thought it was, like, an interesting idea.
[35:12.43]Because I don't do PayPal donations.
[35:15.42]Because PayPal donations, there's a whole fucking chargeback things.
[35:18.84]I don't like the idea of somebody being able to just... We talked about this a long time ago, but even still, this would change with accepting Bitcoin too.
[35:29.75]I don't... It's weird, but I don't like the idea of somebody being able just to have an unlimited amount of money they can give me.
[35:37.93]Just without any wall, without any time to think about it.
[35:40.89]Because let's be real...
[35:45.38]$5,000 is a lot of money.
[35:48.65]It's a lot of fucking money.
[35:50.63]Some of you guys have given more than $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 fucking dollars to this channel.
[35:58.19]So I don't... I don't know.
[35:59.94]I just don't like the idea that somebody can just so easily just open up a PayPal and just dump like $10,000 into my bank account.
[36:09.16]I don't know.
[36:09.90]It's just something that I've been... Why?
[36:11.70]I don't know.
[36:12.14]I don't know.
[36:20.17]And there's the whole thing with the chargebacks too, and people say, oh no, that's been fixed.
[36:23.47]It hasn't been fixed.
[36:24.96]You can still do that.
[36:26.42]There's some other protections that you can do, but it's still a possibility that somebody can do it.
[36:35.49]I totally understand the feeling.
[36:36.75]And it's not me trying to make a wall for people.
[36:39.91]The whole only accepting bits and subs is not to put a wall in.
[36:45.22]To block you from, and oh, you got to take like that stupid percentage that Twitch takes if you do bits.
[36:51.04]I know, I understand.
[36:51.72]I get it.
[36:52.06]I do.
[36:53.51]But the alternative for me is like somebody being able to give an unlimited amount of money in a second.
[37:01.91]And I don't know, maybe at some point, sometimes you think about if you were to give like $5,000, let's say, to me on a stream.
[37:10.50]In one sitting.
[37:11.28]And it's like a boom!
[37:12.44]Like, holy fucking shit!
[37:14.04]$5,000!
[37:14.22]I just... I feel like that's an explosion amount of money that I don't think I'd be, like, necessarily comfortable taking in one sitting.
[37:27.11]It would be sort of an uncomfortable feeling.
[37:29.15]Because I don't think I want someone to do that.
[37:31.13]I don't think I want someone to give me, like, five grand in five seconds.
[37:34.62]And some people have given a...
[37:43.55]How do I mail you baked goods?
[37:47.37]Anyways, what I was saying is this $100, 110,000 bits is $100.
[37:54.67]And you have to kind of go through enough of a process to get these.
[38:00.64]Where you do have to think about what you're doing.
[38:02.84]You do have to think about that money.
[38:05.44]And it's not just like $5,000 you're going to dump in one second.
[38:11.18]I'm repeating myself now.
[38:13.03]But let's keep going before I turn into a total broken record.
[38:18.52]That's what I typically turn into one.
[38:23.06]Get a PO box.
[38:27.70]I thought about a P.O.
[38:28.56]Box, but a P.O.
[38:29.28]Box is weird because what if somebody sends you like a bag of shit?
[38:32.54]I don't want to like get a bag of shit.
[38:34.38]I don't want you to send me drugs.
[38:36.60]I know, and look, not everybody's going to do it, but I know some of you fucking clowns out there, some of you jokesters out there will send me a bag with like crack in it.
[38:46.67]And then I'm in possession of crack.
[38:48.89]What am I going to do when I open up a box on stream and there's crack in the box?
[38:55.41]I ain't gonna do it.
[38:56.43]I ain't gonna smoke it.
[38:58.21]I ain't touching it.
[38:58.93]I don't want my fingerprints on it.
[39:01.09]What do I do with it?
[39:02.01]Throw it in the trash?
[39:07.62]Snort it.
[39:08.28]Oh my God, you guys.
[39:10.90]Fucking hell.
[39:12.94]Sell it.
[39:14.79]No, I, my hands, when I, if I open that box and I say, I open a box from a PO box.
[39:21.01]I don't know, people prank people all the time.
[39:23.14]Isn't there a whole company whose sole reason for being is to send somebody envelopes that when they open, it explodes glitter all over their fucking house and it takes like weeks to clean it up.
[39:36.23]I don't want to do that.
[39:36.93]I don't want you to send me a glitter bomb in the mail, you know, like that you open it.
[39:39.93]It's like, don't they sell those?
[39:41.97]Isn't there a company who only does that?
[39:44.26]What's the name of that company?
[39:50.25]Whatever.
[39:50.55]You're giving people too many ideas.
[39:52.47]No, I'm not giving you ideas.
[39:53.49]I'm telling you things that are guidelines to not break them.
[39:57.78]It exists with elephant shit.
[39:58.94]Well, I don't want you to send me that.
[40:01.44]I don't want to have elephant shit in my mouth.
[40:03.42]Why would I want you to send me that?
[40:08.65]Anyways, let's move on.
[40:10.03]Oh.
[40:13.54]But yes, to answer the question, Moifity, having my public Bitcoin address is something that I thought of doing when I started to actually get into caring about cryptocurrencies.
[40:25.77]But I don't know if I'll do it.
[40:26.71]Probably not.
[40:27.81]Maybe, though.
[40:28.40]Probably not.
[40:29.92]Penny Kettle, thanks for the $10.20.
[40:31.62]Hey, Mr. Elbertson, I've been watching you for as long as I can remember.
[40:34.98]Got my name right.
[40:35.90]Thank you.
[40:37.14]Spelled it right, too.
[40:38.64]Like, since the beginning, you're the most genuine person I've ever met, in quotes.
[40:42.54]And your desire to entertain is amazing.
[40:44.30]You live to entertain.
[40:45.63]Thank you.
[40:46.51]Also a request.
[40:47.87]Next time you want to stream a full game, please play Infamous 1 and 2.
[40:51.69]They are so fun.
[40:52.57]That's a good idea.
[40:55.47]Thank you, Penny Kettle.
[40:57.27]Just about $11.
[40:59.51]$10.50.
[41:04.08]Elbertson.
[41:06.62]Ernie Elbertson.
[41:07.32]That's actually my birth name.
[41:08.78]It's Arnold Elbertson.
[41:13.31]I don't know why everybody got this idea.
[41:15.29]I don't know where people are getting my actual name from.
[41:17.23]It's like weird.
[41:19.78]It's weird when people know your full name.
[41:22.58]Like, Arnold Elbertson.
[41:23.96]It's strange to say that out loud and know that there's this many people here that know what that is now.
[41:31.39]Um... Anywho.
[41:40.05]Uh...
[41:44.21]This donation is really, really like... I can't read it out loud.
[41:48.23]It's a little too weird.
[41:49.01]I can't read it.
[41:50.43]But thank you to that person that I gave that donation.
[41:54.99]Anyways.
[41:57.85]Thank you for the $1.95.
[41:59.89]Bald coin cash is the real bald coin.
[42:02.37]Now that's relevant.
[42:05.07]That's a relevant joke that's in the sphere of cryptocurrencies.
[42:09.16]I like it.
[42:11.33]I like it.
[42:11.79]You know what you're talking about.
[42:12.83]You know what you're doing.
[42:17.07]Alright, I'll read it.
[42:17.67]It was one cent.
[42:20.97]It was one bit.
[42:23.79]And it said, you suck.
[42:27.55]That's all it said.
[42:29.17]From... Let me see if I can pronounce this name.
[42:36.78]Get out of... Get out of here.
[42:41.28]And then a bunch of gibberish.
[42:48.52]You can't get one bit, you liar.
[42:52.49]Oh no, they caught me!
[42:54.77]What was the thing he was actually laughing at?
[42:56.99]I don't know.
[43:01.77]There was something left in there and it almost made me puke.
[43:05.18]I had like that reaction.
[43:07.38]This hit the back of my tongue and it was like, are you going to puke?
[43:09.98]No, you're not.
[43:10.34]You're fine.
[43:11.78]We're fine.
[43:12.18]I just had the thought that I was... I had a thought.
[43:17.04]You lied.
[43:17.74]I told you, like, 80% of the things that I say in this stream are not real.
[43:22.92]We're in the Matrix.
[43:23.68]I told you I'm up there in a fucking capsule.
[43:26.22]I'm up there in a Tylenol gel cap.
[43:28.77]And I'm looking down.
[43:29.73]I'm in the Matrix right now.
[43:31.27]You're watching this right now.
[43:32.75]Like, I'm not fucking real.
[43:37.25]I'm not real.
[43:38.59]This is not real.
[43:39.37]You're looking at a screen that I'm being beamed into.
[43:42.57]I'm not fucking real.
[43:48.17]Streamer admits to lying all the time.
[43:53.88]Like, huh?
[43:56.68]What am I doing here?
[43:57.80]I was going to do like a karate chop this way, but then I like decided not to.
[44:06.32]No, I don't need to prove it.
[44:08.68]No, he's so woke.
[44:12.02]Let's get back to bits.
[44:13.00]No more dog shit, jokey nonsense.
[44:15.29]Let's get back to the actual thing we were doing.
[44:18.83]Let's go through the bit Q&A.
[44:21.29]You don't have to give money to ask a question.
[44:27.50]That's what we're currently doing.
[44:29.70]We'll continue.
[44:30.34]Let's go.
[44:36.79]uh earlier we had from Ben eleanor gave fifty dollars I didn't I didn't get to catch his fifty dollar uh donation he said early boys thank you so much Ben you have given so much fucking money to this stream it's absolutely fucking bonkers mate it's bonkers you've given the fucking right amount of money money that I can't even count I can't count it
[45:02.62]There's no amount of hands I can... I don't have enough fucking hands to count that money, mate.
[45:08.45]I can't fucking do a British accent.
[45:10.27]It pisses me off.
[45:14.95]Have you seen this?
[45:26.94]Thank you, though, man.
[45:27.48]Thank you so much, man.
[45:29.66]Lyro Sitor, Lyro, thank you Lyro for the $1.
[45:33.05]I'm so glad I finally get to catch a stream.
[45:35.07]Can we expect more EU-friendly streams in the future or will it always be very irregular?
[45:40.85]It's that part.
[45:41.69]It's that one.
[45:42.35]It's going to be very irregular.
[45:44.64]Pissed me off too.
[45:45.66]I'm sorry.
[45:48.20]Don't be mad at me.
[45:50.40]Am I having a midlife crisis?
[45:51.76]Well, that would mean that I would have to be in my midlife and I'm not.
[45:55.64]I'm not old enough for that yet.
[45:57.44]Another like 15 to 20 years and I'd be in like a midlife crisis situation.
[46:01.52]So no.
[46:02.48]Not old enough yet.
[46:03.30]The white light.
[46:10.15]You think the lights are making me like go nuts?
[46:12.07]No.
[46:13.75]My hairline says otherwise.
[46:15.21]My hairline is fine for an older young adult.
[46:21.41]I'm an older young adult.
[46:29.43]What's my opinion on scented barkers?
[46:31.49]They're too unnatural.
[46:32.41]That's weird.
[46:35.05]It's too unnatural for me.
[46:37.46]Mm-mm.
[46:38.04]Don't like it.
[46:38.46]Mm-mm.
[46:42.14]Not a fan.
[46:45.04]Okay, what else we got here?
[46:46.60]I gotta like sit back and relax, man.
[46:49.08]My fly is up.
[46:50.06]Yeah.
[46:51.26]Right here.
[46:52.06]This is better.
[46:56.27]That's good.
[46:57.35]Hold on.
[46:57.85]I gotta check something real quick.
[46:59.25]Hold on.
[46:59.61]Give me a sec.
[47:02.85]Give me a sec.
[47:03.35]I gotta check something real quick.
[47:05.03]Okay.
[47:08.47]Thank you to LaFerro for the 25 cents.
[47:12.12]The internet came out on January 1st, 1983.
[47:14.14]Did it?
[47:14.64]Where are you getting that information from?
[47:18.14]Are you sure?
[47:20.42]Emperor Zorro, thanks for the three bucks.
[47:21.82]Thank you for all the laughs you give me.
[47:23.02]I'm praying for you and God bless you.
[47:27.61]We've got a godly man or woman in the chat here.
[47:30.37]Thank you.
[47:30.71]Appreciate it.
[47:33.33]Godly person.
[47:34.81]Alright.
[47:36.47]Alright.
[47:36.85]I can hang with that.
[47:37.39]That's cool.
[47:38.21]Thank you.
[47:40.33]Ben Elnor.
[47:41.29]Again, this is the $100 that I missed from before.
[47:44.93]No piss pillows, immersion loss.
[47:46.65]I wasn't talking about piss.
[47:47.47]I was talking about sweat.
[47:48.69]If you go to your pillow and you take off your pillowcase...
[47:51.82]And you just look at it.
[47:53.62]If it's a white pillowcase, it's going to be like an off-white yellow brown because of the sweat.
[47:58.55]Your sweat dries and then turns into a like stained kind of teeth yellow.
[48:04.25]And trust me, it's not pretty when you look at this.
[48:07.47]That's why they say always change your pillow.
[48:08.81]People do this thing where they change their mattresses, but they don't change their pillows.
[48:14.04]So you end up with this disgusting like yellow teeth pillow.
[48:18.50]And a brand new mattress.
[48:19.68]Change your pillow.
[48:20.44]A new pillow was like fucking 20 bucks.
[48:23.18]Just get a new pillow.
[48:23.98]It's don't, it's, that's why, and people like talk about like, oh, people like having skin problems and stuff.
[48:28.75]Check out your pillow, man.
[48:30.25]Need new pillow.
[48:31.49]Need new pillow cases once every couple of weeks.
[48:34.25]Get a new pillow case on there.
[48:35.31]Get a new pillow once every month.
[48:37.17]No, once every like six months, get a new pillow.
[48:42.41]But thank you, Ben.
[48:43.99]Again, for the a hundred bucks.
[48:47.53]You are, you are, you are, you are, you got money.
[48:50.81]And you're giving it to me.
[48:52.79]A lot of it.
[48:54.16]So.
[48:56.28]I'm not worthy.
[48:57.30]Thank you so much, dude.
[48:59.86]Also, to round this part of the stream out, and by this part I mean, like, the end.
[49:06.16]Uh.
[49:07.72]Thank you, Kilganon, for the bits.
[49:09.38]Jerma just wanted to remind you of PsyOps.
[49:11.08]I think you'll really enjoy it.
[49:15.07]You can telekinetically throw things around to kill people.
[49:20.14]I watched five and a half ads for these bits.
[49:22.34]That's how much I want to see you play this game.
[49:25.20]I'm going to look that up the second this stream is over.
[49:28.19]Because I'm actually very curious.
[49:31.23]Why is everything blue?
[49:31.93]Because it's Christmas!
[49:35.73]In like 24 days.
[49:38.00]Whatever, 21 days.
[49:40.66]Thank you, Kilgannon, though.
[49:42.99]Also, thanks to Chojiboy for the $2.50.
[49:48.82]Sharing is caring, especially if it's razors, needles.
[49:53.82]What are you talking about?
[49:55.54]What do you want about here?
[49:59.58]I don't want to... Whoa.
[50:06.23]Here we go.
[50:08.39]Let's pump the brakes on this one a little bit.
[50:11.74]Let's like slow down to the stop sign a little bit here.
[50:17.06]Thank you, though, dude.
[50:19.70]Also, let's do a little bit of a bing bong here.
[50:25.17]Forest Tournament, thanks for the $1.
[50:26.67]Jerma, this is your mother.
[50:27.51]Let me see those beautiful rosy cheeks of yours.
[50:29.29]Take a look.
[50:31.29]Nuclear Ma, thank you for the $1.
[50:33.31]$1 joke, thanks for the laughs.
[50:35.29]Other side.
[50:36.23]That kind of hurt.
[50:37.35]Sorry.
[50:38.35]Ow.
[50:38.55]Why am I saying sorry to you?
[50:39.39]That's just sorry to me.
[50:40.15]That hurt me.
[50:41.89]My brain.
[50:43.00]OrthoCone.
[50:43.58]What's up, dude?
[50:44.08]OrthoCone, thanks for the $5.
[50:45.24]Clean your monitor on stream.
[50:47.06]Okay.
[50:51.06]Got it.
[51:02.08]Thank you, Orthocone, for the $5.
[51:03.44]Also, thank you to Dread Roberts for the $5.
[51:07.06]Play Monster Hunter Beta on PS4.
[51:08.58]Merry early Christmas.
[51:09.47]Merry early Christmas to you as well, Dread Roberts.
[51:11.63]Thank you for the $5.
[51:12.55]And I'm going to play it when it comes out.
[51:15.25]So, no.
[51:16.11]Not going to do it now.
[51:17.49]Thank you, though.
[51:19.01]Sergeant Dingus, thank you for the bits.
[51:20.55]Now that you beat Demon's Souls, time for Dark Souls 1.
[51:22.78]Maybe.
[51:23.40]Depends on how well you have the next month or two looks.
[51:25.96]Mostly lost.
[51:26.52]Thanks for the $1.
[51:27.28]That joke was not even close to worth it.
[51:28.90]Take my pity bits.
[51:32.42]That's how we do around here, but thank you, mostlylost.
[51:34.26]Thank you to Shrivel!
[51:36.30]Electricity build fun, thank you.
[51:37.76]Bake me home for the one dollar.
[51:38.92]Hey, Jeremy, you should end the stream by playing Let It Go from Frozen.
[51:41.34]Just kidding, what... Don't ever fucking tell me to do something.
[51:54.15]Because I'm gonna do it.
[51:58.67]Uh, anyways...
[52:01.40]Thank you, too.
[52:05.02]I ain't gonna fucking do it, guys.
[52:06.49]Like, oh my god.
[52:07.37]What do you think this is?
[52:08.63]What do you think?
[52:13.71]I'm some kind of, like, weirdo that, like, plays Frozen every fucking stream?
[52:17.71]We're Rhett and Link and we want- Just wait.
[52:25.39]What are my headphones?
[52:26.58]Fuck.
[52:29.38]Hold on.
[52:29.84]This is gonna be important.
[52:31.74]What's with these fucking tomb three minute unskippable YouTube ads?
[52:35.77]Who fucking made this?
[52:36.71]I need to be able to hear this.
[53:20.98]That was actually pretty good.
[53:23.90]That was a pretty good guitar riff.
[53:25.53]That was good guitar skills.
[53:26.85]I will give him that.
[53:27.67]I will.
[53:29.81]Anyways.
[53:32.05]Thank you to... Holy shit, that was a lot of money tonight.
[53:37.57]You guys are too good to me.
[53:42.03]But thank you, uh, Isti for the five dollars.
[53:43.59]Okay, stop, here's the money.
[53:44.65]Jesus, uh, is that what I wanted?
[53:46.59]That's not what I was telling you.
[53:47.83]SmokewiseGonja, thanks for the five dollars.
[53:49.17]Why not send one of the 985 clones you have to live in Europe so we can have an EU stream this?
[53:52.79]Oh, I thought you were saying, like, stream us, like a Christmas stream.
[53:57.31]But now I get what you're saying.
[53:57.99]It was streams, but it was cut off at the end.
[53:59.97]And then that text came down to the bottom.
[54:02.35]So I thought you said stream us.
[54:03.62]But, yes.
[54:06.22]I can't I can't I'm not gonna be able to do that many EU streams once like every like few weeks I you'll see one maybe like I do once or twice a month.
[54:14.52]I'll try I just I'm never like up an atom at like 10 o'clock in the morning to do like a stream I'm the most awake like now at like 5 to 8 p.m.
[54:24.63]So
[54:28.19]Thank you, though.
[54:29.61]Also, thank you to Greater Head for the $21.35.
[54:32.73]Have a great Christmas, Jeremy.
[54:34.39]Do you think you'd be interested in streaming the original two Thief games?
[54:38.69]Also, for prosperity's sake, my username's supposed to be pronounced Gator Head.
[54:46.40]What did I just call him?
[54:48.32]Greater Head?
[54:48.96]Why am I putting an R there?
[54:54.35]Where...
[54:59.28]I don't know why I'm getting the R from, but thank you, Gator.
[55:00.98]Thank you so much for the, uh, $21.35.
[55:02.58]I mean, it's not off the table completely, but it's not on the table.
[55:08.07]You know, it's not for dinner, but it could be for lunch in, like, a month.
[55:13.27]It's not for dinner, though.
[55:14.69]Not in the next couple weeks.
[55:15.78]I already got dinner planned.
[55:17.38]But thank you, Gatorhead.
[55:19.52]I will take a look.
[55:20.80]Still have to play Metro, like, all the two Metro games.
[55:23.48]I still have, like, the Stalker games to play.
[55:25.50]I have a lot of random shit.
[55:27.32]That I'm kind of holding back in a vault.
[55:29.34]And using when I feel like I want to stream them.
[55:32.02]So there's plenty of things to do.
[55:33.94]Add it to the list.
[55:37.10]Getting close to the end here.
[55:38.02]We've got Muy Fitty for another $1.
[55:39.98]My bits mine has drawn... My bits mine has drawn... Try it again.
[55:48.38]My bits mine has run dry.
[55:50.86]You should start accepting bald coin cash.
[55:53.30]The real bald coin so I can keep donating.
[55:55.73]You guys with this bald coin cash.
[56:02.17]Forks.
[56:04.31]Fucking forks, man.
[56:07.91]I'm not talking about the ones that you eat spaghetti with.
[56:10.91]Not those ones.
[56:13.71]Bald coin cash.
[56:15.25]What's the most angry you've ever been in a video game, even within two?
[56:20.27]I don't know why.
[56:22.54]No, that's not true.
[56:30.22]What is the maddest I've ever been?
[56:38.93]Are we talking like off stream or on stream?
[56:40.73]Because on stream it probably was The Evil Within 2.
[56:45.49]Off stream... Probably Dark Souls.
[56:51.04]Yeah, probably like Dark Souls 3.
[56:54.78]Just sitting there and just being... Because everybody has that shit.
[56:59.48]When you know nobody's watching you, you're a different person when you play video games and you get angry.
[57:05.32]You are.
[57:06.66]How many times have you guys had friends over or you're in a call with somebody online
[57:11.85]And you're playing a game and you're getting really frustrated, but you don't let it out.
[57:14.84]You're kind of just like, oh, what the fuck, you know?
[57:17.56]When you're alone and nobody's watching, no cameras are on.
[57:22.36]That's when you let the real fucking rage out.
[57:24.36]And you start, you start like cursing planets.
[57:27.42]You start like talking shit about like everything.
[57:31.32]You get real fucking angry when you're by yourself.
[57:35.36]So...
[57:37.67]By myself, alone in my basement with a controller in my hand, probably like one of the Dark Souls games.
[57:42.42]Probably Dark Souls 2 or Dark Souls 3.
[57:45.40]On stream, Evil Within 2 or Cuphead, the B level.
[57:49.27]That drove me absolutely fucking crazy.
[57:50.95]That was an, I was an actual insane person on the B level in Cuphead.
[57:55.93]But there you go, there's your answer.
[57:59.30]Uh...
[58:02.95]Thank you, Travelboy, for the $1.
[58:03.95]No, don't play games.
[58:05.25]Do another comb stream.
[58:06.21]There's no comb down here.
[58:07.19]I can't do it.
[58:08.07]I would.
[58:09.89]Onekeyon1, thanks for the $1.
[58:12.23]Perfect name.
[58:12.89]Perfect amount of money.
[58:14.15]Hey, Jeremy, have you played Trials Evolution or This War of Mine?
[58:17.07]Check them out if you haven't.
[58:17.87]I have.
[58:19.29]I used to play Trials at Burgah Boy's house a long time ago.
[58:24.89]And we used to have fun.
[58:25.75]It was a great game.
[58:26.99]Physics-based.
[58:30.00]You know, that... That, uh...
[58:32.93]The bike that has an engine on it.
[58:34.93]The bike that has a motor on it.
[58:36.85]It's shaped like a cycle.
[58:39.59]But there's an engine and a motor.
[58:40.75]I forget what they're called.
[58:42.54]You know what I'm talking about.
[58:47.62]Anyways, thank you.
[58:48.58]I'll get the patch and see if it's better.
[58:56.74]But, I mean, probably not at this point.
[58:59.04]As much as I would like to continue to play.
[59:01.84]There's too many things on the table.
[59:03.52]We'll see.
[59:06.50]And then Anost.
[59:08.12]This is from like 20 minutes ago.
[59:10.80]Anost.
[59:11.46]Anost.
[59:11.92]Thank you for the $100.
[59:13.96]We really appreciate the EU stream.
[59:16.56]Please do more, even if it's only once a month.
[59:19.70]Definitely one of the best parts of the week for me.
[59:21.36]PSL Bitcoin by Ethereum.
[59:25.85]Why are you assuming that I don't already have some?
[59:31.96]You know, that's a little bit of a ding there, you know what I mean?
[59:34.66]Heh.
[59:35.44]Thank you, though.
[59:38.24]Uh, 100 bucks.
[59:41.00]EU streams.
[59:43.24]Uh, so many people want them and I know I'm so bad for not doing them.
[59:48.55]I gotta do them more.
[59:50.57]I really do.
[59:51.96]I gotta find a way to do this, like, on a Sunday or something.
[59:54.01]Like, add a stream to it, you know, whatever.
[59:58.37]It's alright.
[60:00.11]I'll figure it out.
[60:01.95]But thank you so much.
[60:03.45]Also, thank you to... A gray1314, thank you for the $1.
[60:08.98]Hey Jerm, I was told the PC release of Monster Hunter is coming out a month after console.
[60:15.09]That's encouraging.
[60:17.14]Also, have you ever thought of turning on or adding BTTV emotes such as MonkaS?
[60:26.46]Thanks for the streams.
[60:28.61]I don't have better twitch.tv, so I don't know what it is.
[60:32.37]But I know, isn't that like the face where the guy has like the, oh God, like the world is like, I'm terrified, nervous face.
[60:39.54]It's like nervous face, right?
[60:41.72]Isn't that what MonkaS is?
[60:45.58]Yeah, I'm like a nervous frog, right?
[60:49.94]I don't, like, use Better twitch.tv, so... I know that, uh... I know that Laughing Biscuit came from Better twitch.tv.
[60:57.83]That's all I know, though.
[61:00.99]Anywho, let's keep going.
[61:02.95]Almost done with the bits.
[61:05.92]I did say that before, and a lot of people kept donating after I said that.
[61:10.34]A lot of people did, actually.
[61:11.70]Jesus Christ.
[61:13.79]You guys are fucking... You guys are fucking giving me so much goddamn money!
[61:20.67]I'm gonna buy a... I'm gonna buy a McDonald's PlayPlace with this money.
[61:25.99]And I'm gonna be the one guy that owns a McDonald's PlayPlace.
[61:28.92]It's gonna be great.
[61:30.78]It's gonna be mine.
[61:31.60]Nobody else can go in it.
[61:32.44]It's just for me.
[61:34.08]It's just for me and my, like, 600 hamsters.
[61:37.94]I'm just gonna let them all loose and we're all gonna fucking crawl around the tunnels and shit.
[61:42.27]I can't wait.
[61:42.71]It's going to be fucking amazing.
[61:47.24]But anyways, let's keep going.
[61:50.52]Shrivel thanks for the bits.
[61:52.54]And to Joe.
[61:59.86]Somebody just gifted me a one month subscription to Bass Frog.
[62:06.29]What is Bass Frog?
[62:15.79]What?
[62:18.27]Is that like- is that a streamer?
[62:25.33]I don't know, but apparently I'm a subscriber to- to BassFrog now.
[62:30.21]Or I think it was- no, it was BassFrog.
[62:33.13]Bass.
[62:33.53]No, I think it's BassFrog.
[62:37.54]Okay, whatever.
[62:39.86]I just saw it pop- I've never seen that before.
[62:41.26]It popped up on the screen, like on my Twitch, like, page.
[62:43.72]It was weird.
[62:46.20]I look cold.
[62:46.94]I am cold.
[62:47.64]Very cold.
[62:50.88]Acid Frog.
[62:53.10]Thank you, too.
[62:56.02]Shrivel.
[62:57.80]The second after I cheer, I feel bad about it.
[62:59.70]Cheer 25.
[63:00.86]Oh, boy.
[63:03.16]Well, that's why you have to have the things in place so you can't just dump all your money.
[63:06.04]That's why the casino.
[63:06.74]When you go to the casino, don't spend all your money on one table.
[63:09.88]There you go.
[63:10.68]There's your advice.
[63:12.12]Don't spend your money all at one table.
[63:14.62]Also, AnteJoe, AnteJoeP, I keep saying your name that way, I don't know why I like saying it that way.
[63:18.70]Thanks for the $1.
[63:19.60]GermaBox, hey, cheer 100.
[63:22.16]TheRunkly, thanks for the bits.
[63:24.66]PinaChip, thanks for the $10.
[63:26.72]Made you look.
[63:28.61]You actually did, I saw your name pop up over here and I said I looked at it.
[63:31.31]So, thank you, PinaChip.
[63:33.27]Oh, PinaChip.
[63:34.73]For the ten bucks.
[63:35.31]Slam Chowder, thanks for the ten dollars.
[63:36.87]Hey Arnold Robertson, been watching you for two days, you're alright I guess.
[63:41.37]I have a request though.
[63:42.55]Can you teach the stream how to have a jawline like yours?
[63:46.00]It's actually pretty easy.
[63:48.22]Um, when, like don't shave.
[63:50.96]Like when you don't shave, and you get this down here, and remember, shave after like four or five days, but on that like fourth day,
[64:03.27]On that fourth day, guys, you look like, you look like a goddamn Adonis.
[64:08.78]You know what I mean?
[64:09.28]You got this beautiful jaw.
[64:11.62]It makes this nice line.
[64:15.18]That's how you do it.
[64:16.22]When I shave my face, I go, it looks like this.
[64:20.44]I mean, sure, like my profile, like my profile, yeah, like I got like this little butt chin here.
[64:26.88]But besides my butt chin, I don't have, I'm not that strong back here.
[64:30.95]I got a strong butt chin.
[64:33.29]But besides that little here and like here, it's all beard, man.
[64:37.79]It's all fake beard.
[64:38.61]That's all it is.
[64:41.47]But thank you, Slam Shadow.
[64:42.37]Welcome.
[64:43.13]Thanks for sticking around.
[64:44.69]Hope you enjoy your time here.
[64:45.67]Because I have.
[64:48.56]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[64:50.48]Back at you.
[64:51.68]So, Emperor Zoro, thanks for the bits.
[64:54.70]Uncle Spicy, thanks for the bits.
[64:58.34]Turtle Lamp, thank you for the bits as well.
[65:00.68]A lot of people came in here very, very quickly.
[65:04.04]Official Blue Apron.
[65:05.58]Yeah.
[65:07.88]Official Blue Apron.
[65:08.96]Thanks for the bits.
[65:09.96]Open a PO box so I can send you Blue Apron meals.
[65:17.28]That's not real.
[65:18.22]That's not the official Blue Apron account.
[65:20.20]I refuse to believe that.
[65:22.58]But thank you.
[65:23.02]Thank you also to Variable Mania for the $1.
[65:26.74]Thanks for all the hyucks over the years.
[65:28.00]Whenever there's a time you don't have a game lined up to stream or don't know what to play, I think you'd like Intrusion 2.
[65:34.53]It's short, sweet, with some goofy physics systems like you like.
[65:39.33]I will write it down.
[65:40.21]Intrusion 2.
[65:41.63]I will check it out, maybe.
[65:42.69]Thank you.
[65:43.43]Thank you, Variable Mania.
[65:46.11]Ollie Swen, thanks for the $2.
[65:48.57]Love your vids, man.
[65:49.21]Keep it up.
[65:49.53]Can I ask for some advice?
[65:50.65]Moved away from family for the first time.
[65:52.37]How did you deal with it?
[65:54.87]Well, if you move away for the first time, the best thing you can do is, are you talking like you moved out of your house?
[66:05.15]Let me see if I can see you in the chat here.
[66:07.63]Because the honest to God, here's the honest to God answer.
[66:12.63]Looking for Ollie Swen.
[66:14.89]Did you move into your own apartment?
[66:18.03]Or are you talking about going to college or something?
[66:21.27]Because if you're talking about going to live on your own, then living completely on your own is so much easier.
[66:33.03]People are saying beer and shit
[66:38.80]No.
[66:40.46]Get a dog.
[66:42.48]It's that simple.
[66:44.68]If you already have a dog, I have a room I'm renting out.
[66:48.56]Do they allow animals?
[66:50.63]Because having like a pet, having like a dog or a cat or even something as small and...
[66:59.29]Not like a huge deal as like a gerbil or a hamster or something.
[67:02.23]I'm not even kidding.
[67:02.79]I swear to God.
[67:03.93]When you have something that's your little buddy, the world doesn't seem so scary.
[67:13.07]When I first moved into this place, I moved in here by myself.
[67:19.17]I lived with other people before.
[67:21.04]I lived with my parents before.
[67:23.26]I got this place by myself.
[67:26.08]And it was like fucking weird because there was no people here.
[67:30.01]And it was just like, where are the fucking humans?
[67:32.51]I don't know what to do.
[67:34.03]I'm scared.
[67:35.39]And Otto came with me.
[67:37.23]And it made it more like a home.
[67:39.67]Because I actually had like a little buddy.
[67:41.37]Like a little friend.
[67:42.81]It wasn't just like me by myself alone.
[67:45.29]Alone against the world, you know what I mean?
[67:47.67]So if you can, I recommend a pet.
[67:51.22]Even if it's not a dog.
[67:52.04]It doesn't have to be a dog or a cat.
[67:54.16]Just something that you...
[67:57.28]can call yours, and it can be your friend.
[68:00.69]In times of need, obviously, right?
[68:03.83]We all need it sometimes, we do.
[68:08.92]But thank you.
[68:09.64]Best of luck to you.
[68:12.64]Also, thank you to Tommy989898
[68:19.19]Do a Sherlock impression.
[68:20.33]I've never seen any media with Sherlock Holmes.
[68:22.52]Not the movies, not the books, not the TV shows, not the fucking cartoons.
[68:26.36]I've never seen a piece of media with Sherlock Holmes.
[68:28.88]I cannot do that for you.
[68:30.18]I apologize.
[68:30.90]I'm sorry.
[68:31.24]It's not going to happen.
[68:32.88]Thank you, though.
[68:34.70]Hans Beetz, thanks for the $1.
[68:36.39]Is it true that you have Crohn's?
[68:38.03]Just found out I have it and depressed as fuck.
[68:43.51]Anytime I hear somebody else that has like IBD,
[68:46.77]And actually, it's funny, interesting that you bring that up because I have colitis.
[68:55.15]And at first, they thought I could have Crohn's.
[68:58.29]They thought I had Crohn's.
[68:59.48]And then I got reevaluated.
[69:00.92]And, oh, you have colitis.
[69:02.14]And then I got reevaluated again.
[69:03.72]No, you have proctitis.
[69:05.36]No, no, you actually have colitis again.
[69:07.92]IBD is like the most obnoxious illness to have because sometimes it takes a long time for them to figure it out exactly what it is you have.
[69:17.26]So... So will someone please tell Jerma that was the real Blue Apron account?
[69:28.28]What are you doing here?
[69:30.44]Why are you here?
[69:33.80]Why is Blue Apron watching my stream?
[69:37.22]That's... Wait, what?
[69:40.89]Now I feel bad.
[69:41.81]I thought that was somebody making like a trolly joke.
[69:45.27]Ah, I missed the sponsorship opportunity.
[69:48.63]Check out Blue Apron.
[69:49.87]They got the freshest fucking fish I've ever had.
[69:52.87]Freshest fish I've ever had came from Blue Apron.
[69:55.51]Best fish I've ever had came from Blue Apron.
[69:58.34]Most scrumptious steak I've ever had.
[70:00.16]It was a 16 ounce T-bone.
[70:01.86]Guess where it came from?
[70:03.18]Guess where it came from?
[70:04.42]Hello, Fresh.
[70:12.18]I'm just kidding.
[70:12.86]It came from Blue Apron.
[70:15.63]Blue Apron's fucking awesome.
[70:16.99]Everybody loves Blue Apron.
[70:18.05]It came from Walmart.
[70:19.21]No, but if you're real, then... Sorry.
[70:26.09]Sorry, I kind of fucking threw you under the bus there.
[70:30.14]But, anyways.
[70:31.42]We were talking about Crohn's and Colitis.
[70:35.28]It took me, like, I don't know.
[70:37.93]I want to say a good three years before it was under control.
[70:44.97]My IBD was out of fucking control for about two or three years.
[70:49.92]And if you get the right doctor and the right plan to push yourself into a remission state, you'll figure it out.
[70:57.22]It'll happen.
[70:57.90]It's just going to take a little while.
[70:59.46]Because they'll put you on the immunosuppressants.
[71:05.18]I was on those.
[71:05.90]Those are fucking weird.
[71:07.49]They'll put you on stuff like meslamine, I think it's called.
[71:13.25]Azacol is actually the name of the medicine.
[71:14.85]It's like an intestinal anti-inflammatory.
[71:17.19]They're going to try a bunch of random shit, and one of them is going to work.
[71:22.57]One of them will work eventually.
[71:26.37]My insurance doesn't fucking pay for it anymore, even though I have my own insurance.
[71:32.15]I could go off on a whole other tangent on this one.
[71:35.56]But I got something that really, really works really well.
[71:39.66]Am I on a really strict diet to keep it in check?
[71:41.51]No.
[71:43.45]My fucking colitis problems don't have really anything to do with diet as much as they do with... In my opinion, I think it's, like, stress and sleep is what, like, triggers my symptoms.
[71:56.80]So...
[71:57.64]As long as I stay, like, calm and collected.
[72:00.22]And I'm not talking about, like, frustrated.
[72:01.54]I'm talking about, like, sleeping and stress and not sleeping.
[72:05.36]That's what does it for me.
[72:06.79]At least from... I guess my understanding of it.
[72:10.41]I don't drink very much alcohol either.
[72:12.07]Like, you're supposed to stay away from alcohol, so... It's the real Blu-ray print.
[72:18.13]Alright, we'll get... Send me some, like, coupons!
[72:21.29]Look, if you send me some coupons, I'll go like this on stream with your coupons.
[72:25.31]I'll go...
[72:27.73]And at least, like, I'm gonna do it fast.
[72:29.57]I'm gonna do it really fucking fast.
[72:32.18]But I can promise that somebody will see it.
[72:34.90]But there's gonna be other coupons in there, too.
[72:36.34]Not just yours.
[72:37.30]There's gonna be McDonald's coupons in there.
[72:39.14]Because we like to spread out.
[72:39.96]We like to take really healthy, very, very, like, hand-crafted, uh, chef-quality foods, like from Blue Apron, for instance.
[72:49.19]But we also like to eat fast food, too.
[72:51.31]Like McDonald's.
[72:52.98]But, you know, again, not only do we love the love and the passion and the handcrafted, absolute delicious programs that you can get from a very, very reasonable price from Blue Apron.
[73:04.54]We have that, but we also have McDonald's, too.
[73:08.62]Give me those coupons.
[73:09.48]I'll go like this.
[73:13.56]That's not a stealth insult.
[73:14.99]That's just me being a fucking weirdo.
[73:20.27]Uh, that came from a Sherlock Home impression bit donation, didn't it?
[73:24.56]No, that came from Crohn's.
[73:25.88]No, it didn't.
[73:27.56]That came from, like, the guy who was actually Blue Apron.
[73:29.28]I don't know where we even are.
[73:31.96]But, Hans, best of luck to you, for real.
[73:34.56]Hans beats.
[73:35.96]It is kind of an annoying struggle for a couple years, but you will figure it out, because I got it, I had that shit, and I figured it out.
[73:44.23]I'm okay now, so.
[73:46.23]I have the utmost confidence that you will figure it out, and you'll be fine.
[73:50.20]Take care of yourself.
[73:51.24]Much love, dude.
[73:53.04]Uh, Ratuna!
[73:56.09]Rat... What happened?
[73:57.91]Blue Apron down.
[73:58.73]What do you mean?
[74:00.01]What happened?
[74:00.39]What happened?
[74:00.71]Wait, what happened?
[74:04.09]Hold on, did Blue Apron... Did Blue Apron just get, like, banned from the channel because they, like, posted a link?
[74:09.72]Alright, so...
[74:18.44]Okay, wait wait wait.
[74:19.92]Are we like in real time watching me do like a Blue Apron sponsorship?
[74:23.88]Is this how this starts?
[74:28.29]Is this how I get a Blue Apron sponsorship?
[74:33.13]How does this work?
[74:37.23]Blue Apron doesn't know chat rules.
[74:40.96]It's Nightbot.
[74:41.58]It was Nightbot.
[74:42.26]Nightbot did it.
[74:43.76]How do we like, how do we bring Blue Apron back?
[74:46.58]Should I mod Blue Apron?
[74:50.03]No, that's total sponsorship right there.
[74:53.37]You're going to mod the company?
[74:56.43]I work for Blue Apron now.
[74:59.20]Even my fucking stream is blue.
[75:01.88]I pretty much work for them.
[75:06.75]It's so funny.
[75:07.17]Me and Kim were actually talking about getting Blue Apron.
[75:09.37]I'm not even kidding.
[75:10.87]This is fate.
[75:11.79]We were talking about trying one of those services and Blue Ripon was the one that we actually were like, we like think we were going to try.
[75:18.96]So, perfect.
[75:20.20]Did he say that just because you're here or did he say that because it's real?
[75:23.74]You be the judge.
[75:26.42]They're calling you out on Twitter.
[75:27.86]What are you talking about?
[75:28.88]Don't say that.
[75:29.51]Are they actually?
[75:32.87]No, they're not.
[75:36.15]Just buy the groceries.
[75:37.27]I'm an idiot.
[75:38.81]I can't.
[75:45.53]If this is real, I swear to God, this is not gonna be real.
[75:49.27]I'm getting baited by chat, like as hard as it's possibly ever been baited.
[75:56.79]No, I don't see anything.
[75:59.71]None of this has been real!
[76:01.80]None of this has been real, is what you're saying.
[76:09.38]Oh, that's not Blue Apron.
[76:16.74]So what the fuck have we been doing for the last like 15 straight minutes of the stream?
[76:22.97]It's not even real.
[76:23.79]It's not even Blue Apron.
[76:24.63]It's not.
[76:25.01]I refuse to believe it now.
[76:26.07]Oh my god.
[76:29.33]It never was.
[76:29.99]It never was.
[76:34.10]He said it himself.
[76:34.98]He's not from Blue Apron.
[76:39.64]And somebody gifted him a sub.
[76:42.08]Oh my fucking god.
[76:43.54]Jesus Christ.
[76:46.54]Hey, thanks official Blue Apron.
[76:48.72]I'm like kissing ass in front of the camera and shit.
[76:51.32]My god.
[76:52.24]Hey, Merry Christmas.
[76:59.29]Anyways.
[77:01.19]Thank you to Yit Ratuna.
[77:05.75]Mad Moon Rapid, thanks for the one dollar.
[77:08.92]Hey, Jerma, I'd sent one with my resub, but wanted to give you a bit more.
[77:12.77]Just hit my 19th birthday yesterday, missed the stream.
[77:15.83]Well, that's completely... Yeah, happy birthday, man.
[77:17.83]You don't have to watch my stream on your birthday.
[77:20.12]Go do whatever you're gonna do, you know?
[77:22.18]Been watching you since I was 17, and man, you're by far my favorite streamer.
[77:25.40]Well...
[77:26.67]Thank you so much, Mad Moon Rabbit.
[77:28.89]Hope you had a great, absolutely stunning birthday.
[77:32.01]Hope you had plenty of cake.
[77:33.79]Hope you got a couple of presents and a couple of blue apron coupons, because that's how I would do my birthday.
[77:38.76]I've got to stop doing that, because it was never real in the first place.
[77:41.70]So I don't know why I'm still doing it.
[77:43.74]But thank you.
[77:46.20]Alright, let's rapid-fire this now.
[77:47.82]Time for the rapid-fire bits.

[78:00.23]Thank you, Caxorus.
[78:01.83]Much appreciated.
[78:02.85]Moifity, thanks for the $1.
[78:04.05]Insert yet another topical crypto joke here as an excuse to give money.
[78:06.93]Also, in case you actually start accepting BTC, vanity addresses are a thing.
[78:12.49]An address that starts with one Jerma, for example.
[78:14.77]That's cool.
[78:16.26]I'm gonna look into that.
[78:16.92]Thank you, Moifity.
[78:19.54]Ancy, thanks for the $3.
[78:20.40]Jerma, have you seen the new Death Stranding trailer and how...
[78:25.27]Would Ultra Instinct Goku do in the next Jerma Rumble?
[78:28.43]I wouldn't put Goku in a Rumble.
[78:29.63]It's too mainstream for me.
[78:31.27]Death Stranding looks ridiculous.
[78:32.63]It's like babies and shit.
[78:33.67]It's weird.
[78:34.11]I'm looking forward to it.
[78:35.67]It's obviously like a Kojima game.
[78:36.99]It's not Metal Gear, so... It's kind of interesting on its own already.
[78:41.45]But it looks cool.
[78:43.82]Thank you, though.
[78:44.28]Thank you to Skeleton Shaman.
[78:47.44]Have a nice day.

[78:50.30]Maybe on a good day, but not today.
[78:52.32]I'm kind of a sweaty piece of shit today, but that's fine.
[78:56.54]Cool Cat, thanks for the $1.
[78:57.80]Did you see the new game teaser FromSoftware released?
[78:59.64]It might be Bloodborne 2.
[79:01.42]I don't know if I can say that's what it is yet because it was just like a bone inside of like a wince that just goes... It doesn't like do anything.
[79:09.75]That was it.
[79:10.23]So until we get more info, I'm going to hold my breath on Bloodborne 2.
[79:15.10]Also is the again.

[79:48.94]The B boss in Cuphead.
[79:50.55]The B boss.

[80:07.56]Activated my almonds.
[80:09.72]But what else am I supposed to call a streamer that dabs on stream?
[80:15.09]We don't talk about that.
[80:16.31]Thank you, ChickenFactsBot.
[80:19.31]All you say is feels good, man.
[80:21.03]I was expecting a chicken fact.
[80:23.83]Severely disappointed without the chicken fact.
[80:27.51]It's all good, though.
[80:28.23]PlumTiger, thanks for the $1.
[80:29.55]Hey, Jerma, do you ever talk to Lepter anymore?
[80:31.99]I found your channel through him way back when.
[80:35.13]No, not in at least three or four years.
[80:38.43]It's been like a good three or four years since I've talked to Lepter.
[80:41.64]Hope he's doing well.
[80:43.26]I'm sure he's kind of doing his own thing at this point.
[80:48.32]Wish him the best.
[80:49.92]Hope he's doing good.
[80:52.62]Also, thank you to... Turtle Lamp.
[80:56.34]Thank you for the bits.
[80:58.09]Elizabeth.
[80:59.45]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the $10.
[81:01.33]A few months ago, you said that you were sad that the actor Michael Nyquist had died.
[81:09.16]He is a close friend to my stepdad, and it was kind of eye-opening to hear a hilarious person I look up to like you talk about it.
[81:15.48]Keep up the amazing streams.
[81:19.38]Yeah, he was awesome.
[81:20.26]He was a fucking great actor.
[81:22.14]That's off.
[81:23.28]It's absolutely terrible that he died, because he was by far, like in John Wick, he was like my favorite character in that.
[81:31.92]Besides, obviously, I mean, all the characters are great, but his character in John Wick is...
[81:37.86]fucking perfect.
[81:38.62]It was absolutely perfect.
[81:39.66]And his career, he was going to do so much cool shit.
[81:45.15]But yeah, I'm sorry that you were directly affected by that.
[81:50.83]He was a great actor.
[81:53.41]Very, very good actor.
[81:55.75]But thank you nonetheless, Elizabeth.
[81:57.31]Appreciate it.
[81:59.63]Also, thank you to only a couple more here to do, and then we're going to take off.
[82:05.51]I got some stuff I got to finish and stuff I got to do.
[82:07.13]We'll be live tomorrow.
[82:09.67]Probably... Probably not going to be live at 7 o'clock tomorrow.
[82:14.89]Probably going to be live earlier.
[82:17.43]I'm going to probably pull it back a few hours tomorrow.
[82:19.31]Somewhere around like 4-ish.
[82:21.97]I would assume.
[82:23.23]Because I'm done.
[82:23.93]I don't think I'm going to be doing 7 o'clock tomorrow.
[82:25.61]I've got a lot of stuff going on.
[82:27.91]We'll see though.
[82:29.34]I'll let you know.
[82:31.14]Lyro C. Lyro, thank you for the $1.
[82:33.28]Ever considered playing strategy games on stream?
[82:35.69]You're entertaining.
[82:36.58]I think you can make any genre fun to watch.
[82:39.04]Also, please more EU streams.
[82:41.12]I'm going to try.
[82:41.66]I'm going to go for it.
[82:42.22]I'm going to try for it.
[82:43.78]But thank you.
[82:45.36]Strategy games kind of bore me, unless they're a board game and I'm actually physically looking at them on a table.
[82:50.89]I like to actually be involved in strategy games in general.
[82:54.81]I've never been a big fan of them in the digital world.
[83:00.00]I never was a Civilization fan.
[83:02.42]I never was like an XCOM fan.
[83:04.72]That's barely strategy.
[83:06.00]It is, but is it though?
[83:07.86]It kind of is.
[83:09.84]I guess it is.
[83:10.51]Who am I kidding?
[83:12.91]It's a strategy game, right?
[83:17.33]Tabletop Sim.
[83:18.07]I love Tabletop Sim.
[83:19.55]It's a great game.
[83:21.75]Etalyx brought over some cool board games while I was here.
[83:25.09]We played By the Farm.
[83:27.97]No, what the fuck is the name of the game?
[83:29.39]That's a name I made up for it.
[83:36.11]I don't know, I forget it, but it was cool.
[83:37.45]You, like, buy property.
[83:38.75]It was interesting.
[83:40.41]But, thank you, uh, Elazo, uh, Elazo Genova, if I keep saying your name wrong, Alice Genova, thank you for the five dollars.
[83:49.32]Hi, Jermbo, I hope you play again with Kryken and his crew, that was awesome.
[83:52.90]Also, Kibo said she liked you, and she also played Zumbinis in the movies, so...
[83:59.76]Alright.
[84:00.64]Yeah, that was fun.
[84:01.94]It was fun.
[84:02.56]It was a fun little thing we did.
[84:05.88]Criken's a good dude.
[84:07.10]All those people, all those people are fun.
[84:08.62]They're all friendly.
[84:09.68]They're all good people.
[84:11.99]And yeah, Zimbinis is a fucking great game.
[84:15.41]The movies is a great game too.
[84:17.17]You got great taste.
[84:18.69]Why am I pointing as if like she's here?
[84:20.65]You got real good taste in video games, I would say.
[84:28.17]Thank you, though.
[84:28.61]Appreciate it.
[84:30.47]And finally, Captain Clutch.
[84:33.39]Thank you for the bits.
[84:34.71]Soyjoy4040, thanks for the $5.
[84:36.25]Do you eat ass?
[84:37.82]No.
[84:42.10]Why did I read that?
[84:43.38]Planet Joop, thanks for the bits.
[84:44.98]Been watching you since TF2 with Star, and I've been watching you since.
[84:48.42]Love your streams.
[84:49.04]Keep up the good work.
[84:50.36]Thank you, Planet Joop.
[84:51.13]You keep up the good work being Jupiter in chat all the fucking time.
[84:54.43]You know what I mean?
[84:55.73]You're doing a lot of work here.
[84:57.77]always being in the chat.
[84:59.21]So, you're doing good.
[85:01.11]And finally, chicken facts.
[85:03.11]Chicken facts comes in with a real fact.
[85:05.76]There are 219 million undesirable male chicks killed each year by the egg industries.
[85:14.50]That is a fucking terrible chicken fact.
[85:20.11]And with that, I'm gonna be out, guys.
[85:24.64]Thank you so much, everybody.
[85:26.78]Much love.
[85:28.42]Have a fantastic rest of your evening.
[85:31.26]Have a great rest of your day, wherever you are.
[85:34.80]I will see you tomorrow.
[85:36.40]We're going three days in a row here because I wasn't live on Thursday and Friday yesterday or last week.
[85:40.39]So, going three days in a row.
[85:44.97]Catch you at some point after four tomorrow afternoon.
[85:49.73]Good night, good luck, and goodbye, everybody.
