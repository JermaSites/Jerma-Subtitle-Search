[00:00.57]What?
[00:01.63]Oh, right.
[00:04.59]Look, I cannot be responsible if you're going to bet on this shit.
[00:07.47]Uh, hello.
[00:13.07]How are you?
[00:13.45]Good to see everybody.
[00:18.19]Where's my coaster?
[00:18.81]I have a coaster or something.
[00:20.67]There we go.
[00:25.15]He is responsible.
[00:28.66]Hope you're doing well, everybody.
[00:31.00]Let me tweet this.
[00:32.96]Let me get this frog out of my throat.
[00:34.26]Okay.
[00:49.03]So today we're going to complete Pikmin 2.
[00:53.97]I'm going to finish it.
[00:56.25]We're going to go over a few things, some very important things.
[00:59.90]3.6 million points.
[01:03.50]Half of you guys are going to be rich and half of you are going to be broke.
[01:07.54]And channel points.
[01:09.89]This keeps going on the way that it is.
[01:11.07]22,000 points.
[01:15.43]Oh, mega low.
[01:24.40]But anyways, we've got a lot of things to talk about.
[01:29.10]Streams are going to be... It's just a little different.
[01:31.08]Not anything major.
[01:31.96]Just something a little different.
[01:34.95]So for the next... It's today.
[01:38.91]Today's the 12th.
[01:42.07]For the next three weeks, streams are going to be shorter.
[01:49.62]We're going to pull back the streams a little because on March 6th is going to be a very major stream.
[01:58.70]I can confirm with a hundred percent certainty, with absolute certainty, the archaeology stream will be happening on Saturday, the 6th of March at 1 PM Pacific time.
[02:16.94]That's true.
[02:19.93]Yes, the archaeology stream is happening before the cat boy stream.
[02:24.57]You don't have a date for that one.
[02:25.55]I'm not giving you a date for that one.
[02:27.30]You're just going to have to be watching, okay?
[02:32.84]That is not a cat boy stream.
[02:34.60]I'm going to make that very clear.
[02:36.02]It's not a cat boy.
[02:41.71]No cat boy archaeologist.
[02:43.61]No.
[02:45.39]That's not happening.
[02:46.07]That's a separate stream.
[02:49.16]So there's a lot of stuff that we're doing.
[02:51.71]There's a lot of work that we're doing on this.
[02:54.49]It should be a lot of fun.
[02:56.27]I hope it is.
[02:57.93]But got to put time into it.
[03:01.41]So I'm still gonna be streaming, but just not the same amount of time.
[03:07.95]We'd rather... What were you saying?
[03:10.54]We'd rather longer streams than four hours of one gimmick stream every six months.
[03:16.58]That's what you want.
[03:18.24]What about what I want?
[03:21.21]is this your channel you run the show here I'll give you the keys you want the keys to the house I'll give them to you you want them here take them run it man you ain't getting these keys they're mine
[03:52.89]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[04:05.12]You're several billion dollars in debt.
[04:07.28]I think we own this.
[04:09.23]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:10.93]The collateral for that debt was not the channel.
[04:14.93]It was my Funko Pop collection.
[04:17.61]That was my collateral.
[04:18.93]And when I went in and got the loan...
[04:22.13]I told you you got $62 in collateral for your $5 billion.
[04:31.84]How's that?
[04:37.00]No, but in all honesty, um, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to do what I want to do.
[04:44.84]That's the way it is.
[04:46.06]That's the way it's always been.
[04:47.12]So you might be a new viewer.
[04:49.10]That's the way that this has been.
[04:52.12]for almost a decade not sure how long you've been watching but that's how we do it I was gonna scream let's go as loud as I could let's go this guy spent almost a hundred dollars on funko's oh god how can you imagine
[05:24.97]He wants to be a cat boy.
[05:26.29]Alright, you ready to go?
[05:30.91]Are we ready to play?
[05:36.19]Not doing this on camera ever again.
[05:37.97]I promise you that.
[05:43.97]Alright, let's get it over.
[05:45.89]Whoa, I almost turned the stream off.
[05:47.80]That would have been bad.
[05:53.08]Camera's not on, right?
[05:54.06]Fuck.
[06:00.50]Alright, where are we going?
[06:01.74]Where are we off to?
[06:06.78]It was on.
[06:07.36]No, it wasn't.
[06:07.90]Fucking shirtless Andy.
[06:12.50]So I'm, I got nine.
[06:13.54]How close am I to the end of the game?
[06:15.02]Am I almost done?
[06:16.08]We got a few hours or something, right?
[06:22.72]I drained that pool the last time, right?
[06:31.40]I'm not putting the facecam on.
[06:32.42]No.
[06:32.78]I don't care.
[06:33.79]You're not getting that.
[06:38.59]There's a whole post-game area?
[06:39.97]Oh, cool.
[06:40.33]Alright.
[06:40.57]Alright, so I want to go to that pool that we drained.
[06:48.58]So I'm going on an adventure with blue because somebody said that it's all blue, right?
[06:54.70]I'm blocking the goddamn Wiimote sensor bar with a cup of coffee.
[07:01.77]You look less handsome today, Jermo.
[07:04.14]No, I look great today.
[07:05.40]You know how I know?
[07:09.92]Because I got one of those apps that scans your face and tells you how hot you are.
[07:14.35]I got an 8.5.
[07:15.97]I'm going to go on a grind mission today.
[07:31.35]Yeah, I downloaded this app called, uh, are you ugly or not?
[07:34.57]And it's really funny.
[07:36.33]It scans your face.
[07:37.49]You hold it up to your friend and it goes across the, like the forward facing camera.
[07:44.46]And then it says, you're ugly.
[07:46.16]Confirmed.
[07:47.82]And they, they look in the camera.
[07:48.72]They're like, what, what?
[07:50.06]It takes a, it takes a screenshot of their reaction.
[07:54.72]It's fucking hilarious.
[07:55.94]Okay.
[07:56.74]Where am I going?
[08:03.29]And then they go, what's this app?
[08:04.65]Is this a prank?
[08:09.87]Where am I going?
[08:13.89]Alright, shower room.
[08:15.27]Is that a spoiler?
[08:17.59]I need to kill stuff.
[08:18.35]I need to grind to pick up some blue guys.
[08:25.81]That's a good place to grind to get blues.
[08:30.38]Anybody know?
[08:32.52]Just kill animals, right?
[08:39.01]Alright, pull back.
[08:40.47]Blue, put it to blue.
[08:41.67]You're going blue, right?
[08:43.85]I want blue.
[08:47.15]Not here, and it's not a good place to do it.
[08:50.79]Grind.
[08:52.98]They all live?
[08:53.60]Yeah, what do you mean?
[08:54.18]They're fine.
[08:54.54]What are you talking about?
[09:01.51]Alright, I want blue on there.
[09:05.59]How many blue should I get to go into the shower room?
[09:07.81]Does it matter?
[09:08.25]I want, no, I want that to go to red.
[09:14.68]A little Pikmin chant noise has been, what?
[09:21.18]5k, Andy.
[09:22.66]Shut up.
[09:28.40]the fact that the person voted omega LOL after that it's like come on dude I uh it's like like look at I'm gonna be really honest I like think that's funny every time I don't know why it's like rude that's wicked rude isn't it like oh you got only five I don't know I don't know I think it's funny
[10:02.48]The submerged castle in the shower room.
[10:03.92]Alright, well, hold on.
[10:04.42]Let me, um... I want... I need to get all... It's all blue, right?
[10:08.52]That's what you guys told me.
[10:11.74]You told me that you needed blue for that one.
[10:16.47]Five candy.
[10:17.01]That's wicked funny, dude.
[10:20.31]Oh, shit.
[10:20.81]Maybe six candy.
[10:27.85]Castle is blue, not shower.
[10:30.06]Oh, okay.
[10:32.13]Fill the shower, I can just go with whatever I want.
[10:33.61]Well, I got some blues, that's good.
[10:34.51]Alright, I need a different team then.
[10:38.59]Who the fuck is Andy?
[10:39.53]Well, um, that... Look, you got like five straight years of like Twitch dialog that you have to go through.
[10:47.14]I'm not gonna, I can't, I'm not gonna, I'm not a memeologist.
[10:49.06]I'm not gonna tell you all about that.
[10:51.42]Uh, I'm gonna take 25 blues?
[10:59.27]I can't wait till 50 years in the future go by and there are historians that are going to have to be, like, memeologists.
[11:05.57]That won't be, like, a weird thing to say.
[11:06.79]30 red.
[11:12.06]How many yellows do I want?
[11:16.04]Some of you guys are going to be fucking 80 years old.
[11:20.28]On, like, the History Channel.
[11:22.12]Talking about, like, Kappa and, like, explaining what it is.
[11:31.53]It's called a historian.
[11:38.53]Yeah, but that's not what you'd be called.
[11:48.52]It is.
[11:48.84]It's not though.
[11:50.64]You're a memeologist.
[11:54.14]You're a meme historian.
[11:55.38]Yeah, whatever.
[11:59.96]Okay.
[12:00.66]I want to go to that shower.
[12:05.73]It's over here on the right, right?
[12:07.21]Yeah.
[12:16.30]Wait.
[12:17.44]Isn't there... I saw eggs.
[12:21.30]Ah, fuck it.
[12:21.70]Who cares?
[12:24.50]We'll get those later.

[12:27.11]What do you mean 98?
[12:28.17]Get over here.
[12:29.67]Get over here.
[12:31.51]Meme historian... Yeah, okay.
[12:33.83]Meme historian Andy.
[12:35.65]Yep.
[12:37.22]So you'd be like... Jeffrey Anderson.
[12:40.48]And underneath it would say, Meme historian Andy.
[12:42.60]Alright, nobody's gonna die from this, right?
[12:54.29]Okay, this is... I should be good.
[12:58.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:59.29]What do you mean 63 out of 100 entering?
[13:00.52]What are you talking about?
[13:01.36]Get over here.
[13:06.20]Why did they stop?
[13:07.32]Why did they stop?
[13:07.82]What are you guys doing?
[13:13.22]Get over here.
[13:13.60]90 out of 100.
[13:15.27]What?
[13:18.41]Guys.
[13:22.19]Why are they detaching from me?
[13:33.34]Come here.
[13:35.09]Oh my god, you idiot.
[13:37.03]85?
[13:37.71]What are they doing?
[13:38.95]What do you mean 84?
[13:39.61]What are you talking about?
[13:41.07]What?
[13:48.11]Why did I just lose another... Um, what the hell's going on?
[14:00.70]What happened to the other ones?
[14:05.65]I'm so confused right now.
[14:06.77]I don't understand.
[14:09.33]I had a hundred.
[14:10.39]Where the fuck did they go?
[14:11.13]Okay, they're just buried into the corner?
[14:20.08]That was really bizarre.
[14:28.37]They're just stuck in this corner, deep buried into here.
[14:30.83]Oh, fuck off, game.
[14:33.93]Give me a break.
[14:34.88]Yeah, of course.
[14:39.60]It was a bunch of small blue Andes.
[14:42.10]Okay, whatever.
[14:42.92]Sorry.
[15:06.33]Alright, so this is the shower level.
[15:08.37]I'm looking forward to this.
[15:17.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:17.86]Whoa, back up.
[15:20.69]Alright, we need... That's fire, right?
[15:25.37]Oh my god, I need it.
[15:29.71]I'm resetting.
[15:30.71]I'm resetting.
[15:31.85]I'm gonna reset.
[15:32.69]I'm gonna reset.
[15:33.29]That was fucking bullshit.
[15:34.52]He killed almost every blue Pikmin.
[15:36.34]I'm resetting.
[15:37.02]Okay, I'm resetting.
[15:37.96]We're resetting.
[15:38.52]That's a reset.
[15:39.70]I'm just gonna turn the console off and we'll come back.
[15:45.34]God damn it.
[15:47.64]Hold on, just here.
[15:48.80]There's some cool... Look at this artwork!
[15:50.93]Look at this artwork!
[16:00.78]God damn it.
[16:01.50]Really, the first thing I do...
[16:10.41]Alright, if he didn't kill almost every single blue Pikmin, I wouldn't have cared.
[16:16.03]But, like, that was... The guy wasn't even on screen.
[16:19.37]He was off screen when he did that.
[16:20.77]That's fucking horseshit.
[16:22.61]No, I'm not living with that one.
[16:23.73]I don't care.
[16:24.11]This is dumb.
[16:34.28]How come my Wii Pointer's not working?
[16:40.15]The hell?
[16:44.03]The Wii pointer doesn't work anymore.
[16:46.99]What the fuck is happening?
[16:49.01]I actually cannot... The pointer's not on the screen anymore.
[16:54.14]God, how much was this thing selling for when it came out?
[16:56.76]I hope it was like 50 bucks.
[16:58.88]Not like 500.
[17:00.90]How much fucking was this console?
[17:03.90]What the... Hold on, let me pick up my brick over here with a screen on it.
[17:08.23]Let me go over... Hold on one sec.
[17:15.58]Wii sensor bar settings.
[17:17.48]Give me the other... Hold on.
[17:18.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[17:20.14]How's the sensitivity?
[17:27.72]Why did this thing change sensitivity randomly?
[17:29.25]This doesn't make any sense.
[17:29.95]What the fuck is happening?
[17:32.95]Oh, the ooey gooey.
[17:36.75]This is... I have no idea what's going on.
[17:39.45]Why is it doing this?
[17:46.19]My Wiimote doesn't even work anymore.
[17:51.10]I'm not even kidding.
[17:51.74]I swear to God, like, the Wiimote's not even showing up on screen.
[17:56.58]Like, where's the Wiimote?
[18:00.40]What?
[18:02.54]It thinks I'm holding the Wiimote, like, upside down.
[18:06.49]What the hell are you talking about?
[18:12.29]This thing better have been fucking less than $40 when it came out.
[18:15.68]This is a $40 machine.
[18:17.60]At most, by the way.
[18:18.78]At most.
[18:19.18]Is the Wiimote upside down?
[18:24.41]No.
[18:24.75]What the fuck is it doing this for?
[18:29.15]I'm gonna take the batteries out.
[18:30.27]There's usually the two dots are side by side.
[18:39.37]Why is it... So I'm tilting the controller.
[18:45.00]It's 30, 40 degrees sideways now.
[18:47.98]I'm gonna just... There's supposed to be two dots right next to each other.
[19:00.22]I just did this before I turned the stream on.
[19:02.28]Like, I literally just did this before the stream turned on 20 minutes ago.
[19:07.72]Fucking $40 machine.
[19:13.70]Look at some artwork.
[19:14.24]I'll be right back.
[19:19.43]SensorBot below TV.
[19:21.37]Repair this fucking thing.
[19:28.42]I don't understand.
[19:29.46]Why is it doing this?
[19:30.24]Because I turned the console off?
[19:39.12]Check the TV for more information.
[19:40.58]Some explanations can be scrolled.
[19:41.90]I don't have any info on the TV.
[19:49.38]I think this Wiimote just broke.
[19:54.24]Dude, this Wiimote just is bricked.
[19:55.73]It doesn't even turn it on anymore.
[19:58.11]What?
[19:59.41]Why?
[20:00.05]How?
[20:00.81]What?
[20:02.79]What?
[20:07.37]No, it's not.
[20:07.97]Alright, hold on.
[20:08.51]I've just received the batteries.
[20:11.49]What the fuck is going on?
[20:21.51]Dude, this thing is broken as hell.
[20:25.38]This shit's broken.
[20:26.22]I don't know what to do.
[20:27.10]What do I do?
[20:27.54]Let me try to read.
[20:31.58]This is ridiculous.
[20:37.55]I have no idea what's going on.
[20:38.39]I seriously have no idea.
[20:39.17]I don't know why it's doing this.
[20:42.95]It's not like Cheeto dust on the front of the camera or something, right?
[20:47.19]New batteries.
[20:47.81]It was at like 60%.
[20:59.14]Let me see if it works.
[21:04.56]It won't even show up on the screen.
[21:05.86]I'm sorry.
[21:06.80]This is just bizarre.
[21:07.91]$40 console.
[21:18.65]This is the longest fail bit ever.
[21:20.47]I wish this was a joke.
[21:21.89]No, it's not a joke.
[21:22.67]It's a $40 at most console.
[21:25.95]Would they sell this for fucking $500?
[21:29.75]The Wiimote's broken.
[21:31.06]It's actually broken.
[21:31.72]I can't use it.
[21:41.80]I actually cannot even point at the screen anymore.
[21:45.59]Me turning the console off and turning it back on bricked the Wiimote.
[21:50.55]Hold on.
[21:52.58]Let me get new batteries.
[21:53.38]Give me one second.
[21:54.02]This is stupid.
[21:55.38]I'll be right back.
[24:30.87]okay um so I did the tried and true method the tried and true method is I I smacked it like three or four times and now I have two dots
[25:01.57]Okay.
[25:02.45]Sure.
[25:05.81]Great.
[25:05.99]Okay.
[25:07.67]I don't know why, but for some reason I thought it was a really dark camera and you could see me.
[25:11.31]I was naked in front of this or something.
[25:16.87]Alright, let's go.
[25:18.41]I didn't want to cancel that.
[25:34.47]Get out of here.
[25:46.73]Okay, that that's best one guy.
[25:48.74]That's best one guy moment of the week at least.

[27:14.37]There'll be other ones right after that, too.
[27:16.01]Pretty soon after that.
[27:17.77]I got a whole baseball stream to do.
[27:20.55]Which I can't wait for.
[27:23.21]Mainly because it's already done.
[27:24.95]I just couldn't do it because of COVID.
[27:28.38]That's gonna be my favorite stream I've ever done, by the way.
[27:31.04]I'm gonna make that really clear to you guys.
[27:33.36]Whenever the baseball stream happens, that's gonna be my favorite stream I have ever done.
[27:38.35]I'm serious.
[27:39.77]That's gonna be my magnum opus.
[27:41.01]It will be.
[27:41.33]Alright, now don't die to the giant fucking frog.
[27:46.61]That will be my favorite thing I've ever done.
[27:50.35]And I don't even care how bad it is.
[27:52.15]It doesn't matter.
[27:52.53]Alright, let's go.
[27:58.72]Watch out for the frogs.
[28:00.96]Fuck.
[28:10.63]What about Shpee?
[28:12.05]You know what?
[28:12.47]You're right.
[28:12.83]It'll be close.
[28:15.17]It's going to be very close to Shpee.
[28:16.95]You're right.
[28:17.37]Get in there.
[28:25.66]Peeked at Shpee.
[28:30.69]yeah all fine and whatever everybody says that like seinfeld season four is the best season right they still made four or five more years of that show and everybody still liked it so it doesn't matter
[28:58.12]Don't throw the flowers in?
[28:59.06]Wait, they don't come out as flowers?
[29:00.84]Oh, shit.
[29:01.38]Okay.
[29:02.66]I thought they came out as flowers if you threw a flower in.
[29:04.54]That's my bad.
[29:06.34]That's my bad.
[29:06.80]I didn't know.
[29:08.48]Alright, let's split this up here.
[29:10.26]I want Olimar to get yellow.
[29:11.28]Come here, Olimar.
[29:15.75]And then I want... I want Louie to do red.
[29:21.42]Okay.
[29:22.12]What's over this way?
[29:23.20]Electricity.
[29:24.48]You hang out here.
[29:25.16]Go take care of the electricity.
[29:27.06]That's fire over there.
[29:28.08]When you electrically break this down, fire going after.
[29:35.21]Anything else in there?
[29:35.95]Alright.
[29:36.23]Get the fire.
[29:44.61]He has a blue nose.
[29:45.83]That's water.
[29:46.41]Okay.
[29:47.60]He's got a blue nose.
[29:48.40]Never mind.
[29:49.12]Come back, everybody.
[29:50.06]I thought that was a fire guy.
[29:54.28]We need water.
[29:59.52]This guy is gonna piss me off.
[30:00.86]I need... I gotta kill that guy.
[30:02.30]Like, now.
[30:07.39]I have to kill that guy right now with purples.
[30:15.55]Fuck you!
[30:21.49]I got everybody back, back, back, back!
[30:23.10]I hate these guys.
[30:24.83]I'm freaking out.
[30:25.39]Everyone run.
[30:25.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[30:26.59]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[30:27.43]You're fine.
[30:27.67]You're fine.
[30:28.01]You're fine.
[30:28.43]You're fine.
[30:28.75]You're fine.
[30:29.07]You're fine.
[30:29.39]You're fine.
[30:29.79]You're fine.
[30:30.21]Come back.
[30:30.87]Come back.
[30:31.11]Come back.
[30:31.49]You're fine.
[30:33.19]He's not fine.
[30:33.65]He's dead.
[30:34.07]Get this stupid thing out of the way.
[30:42.38]Kill it.
[30:42.98]Kill it.
[30:58.10]Punch him!
[31:04.54]Alright, good.
[31:07.64]Alright, now it's your turn.
[31:08.90]Get in there.
[31:13.21]Break up.
[31:13.55]Separate.
[31:13.77]Get out of the way.
[31:15.97]Mega lull.
[31:16.79]You didn't even say the O part.
[31:17.87]You got that wrong.
[31:18.39]Alright, do a jump.
[31:20.29]And then... Here we go.
[31:25.87]Good.
[31:26.41]Good.
[31:27.35]I've been told.
[31:27.83]Somebody told me that these guys are the hardest ones in the game.
[31:30.23]They said that the Poliwogs are the hardest.
[31:31.91]I said, Jerma, be careful.
[31:34.07]You're going to rage the Poliwog.
[31:35.17]And I'm like, I probably will.
[31:36.43]I don't know.
[31:43.65]That went a lot smoother than the last one.
[31:53.58]He doesn't know Mega Lulz.
[32:02.15]Okay, everyone else can come through now?
[32:03.25]Everyone's just riding Omega Lull.
[32:10.48]Why is everyone just riding Mega Lull?
[32:17.79]Streamer is unaware.
[32:18.85]Ooh, that's a... What is that?
[32:28.35]It's a juicer?
[32:28.93]It's like a lemon squeezer.
[32:30.43]Let's get the lemon squeezer crew.
[32:32.35]Go for it.
[32:37.71]Oops.
[32:38.61]Everything alright?
[32:46.02]Where are the juicers?
[32:47.42]Juicers.
[32:58.55]You're not the banana bros.
[33:01.01]That's not who you guys are.
[33:02.31]I'm sorry.
[33:02.83]You're the Drew crew.
[33:09.10]Yeah.
[33:10.06]For at least another few months.
[33:11.56]99,000.
[33:11.62]You can't juice a banana?
[33:17.69]Um...
[33:27.81]no no you can I guess you can't you you can though I guess if you juiced a banana if you just ran a banana through a blender and like strained it and pushed on it through the strainer wouldn't like you wouldn't water come on there's some there's water content in banana yes there is it's the same thing yeah that's just that is the same thing why is that person saying that then
[33:54.93]Alright, that's it for... Why... What is this protecting?
[33:58.75]Nothing here.
[34:05.81]Banana smoothie.
[34:08.20]Yeah, somebody said you can't juice a banana, but juicing a banana is just like a banana smoothie.
[34:12.06]It's just like the water content and the pulp and sugar content inside of the banana.
[34:22.40]You can pump any non-viscous liquid for anything you want.
[34:36.32]Just call it chunky juice.
[34:37.57]Yeah, it's the same shit.
[34:51.95]I need some of the gas.
[34:53.87]Anyway, I need a gas guzzler.
[34:55.09]No, not you guys.
[34:57.37]Just the gas guzzlers, please.
[34:58.61]And don't wake that guy up.
[35:04.09]You should do the GTA role playing stuff.
[35:06.90]You know, I've always kind of wanted to do that, but I just really never understood or knew how to even start or who to even talk to or what to even do.
[35:15.44]You guys should know this by now, getting me to install even a patch for an old game to make it work better is like hard for me to do.
[35:27.93]Like installing a full, like complete conversion mod to a game or something, or is there, I don't know.
[35:35.11]I don't know how to, I don't even know where to start.
[35:39.17]I wouldn't do it long term though.
[35:40.18]That's the one thing.
[35:41.46]If I was ever going to do like a GTRP or something, it would be... I would just be like Grandpa for a weekend.
[35:47.66]And then, I don't know, hopefully somebody would just kill me.
[35:49.82]I don't know.
[35:58.75]Like, I would just want to get hit by a bus after a weekend of doing it and just never come back.
[36:04.23]Alright, this guy's going to be a problem.
[36:14.61]In GTA?
[36:15.69]Yes, in GTA.
[36:19.20]That's a new enemy.
[36:19.94]I don't know what that is.
[36:23.32]What do they get?
[36:24.02]Okay, I gotta be careful about this shit.
[36:28.04]Ready?
[36:34.83]Watch out for the meteors.
[36:42.49]You woke up.
[36:43.55]Where they going?
[36:43.91]Okay, good.
[36:44.99]Oh, shit.
[36:45.35]Battery.
[36:47.95]Yeah, that's exactly what's in here right now.
[36:52.37]Duracell.
[36:52.93]I have Duracells in the Wiimote right now.
[36:55.85]And I think it's soap.
[36:56.55]Holy shit.
[36:56.97]This is a lot of treasure.
[37:03.12]Hey, get out of here.
[37:06.28]please don't walk out in front of a bus that's a really I'm not I'm talking about like my character getting hit by a bus in GTA I would just do it for two straight days or three days like Friday Saturday Sunday or something but like Saturday Sunday not this coming Saturday Sunday I'm just saying like in general it's worth a lot of money
[37:42.65]And plus, aren't a lot of these servers hard to get into?
[37:47.14]It's not just a question.
[37:47.86]I can't just be like, hey, I want to stream.
[37:50.22]I'm streaming on GTRP.
[37:51.94]See you tomorrow.
[37:52.50]Thanks for the invite.
[37:53.22]That's not how it works.
[38:00.87]You're a 7K Andy.
[38:01.79]It'll be fine.
[38:02.33]Yeah, I would rather not.
[38:05.79]I would rather like, okay.
[38:08.18]If somebody really was into GTRP...
[38:11.62]I would rather them get the spot than fucking 10k Andy over here just being like, hey, let me in tomorrow.
[38:20.26]Yeah, I'm going to be a grandpa for two days.
[38:31.49]He wishes he was 10k.
[38:38.56]Excuse me, 7k.
[38:40.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:46.55]Everybody back up.
[38:47.09]I want to get rid of... I got a lot of money this one.
[38:49.05]I like this one.
[38:51.35]Careful down there.
[38:57.10]No, my point is, if I was going to do RP, I'd want to just kind of have fun with it for a little bit.
[39:02.12]But I don't want to hop in front of somebody.
[39:05.58]Especially if somebody was... Wait, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[39:11.54]Oh, he killed him.
[39:11.98]Okay, hold on.
[39:18.74]Shit.
[39:19.04]It's alright.
[39:19.42]Eat him.
[39:19.68]That's fine.
[39:20.06]He'll die.
[39:21.62]Whatever.
[39:28.86]What was I saying?
[39:29.44]Yeah.
[39:30.30]I don't want to like... Just jump in front of a line or something if it was possible.
[39:35.00]Just because I wanted to do it.
[39:36.24]If there were people that... Actually like RPing and stuff.
[39:40.08]And... I don't know.
[39:41.28]Like Jerma985 just fucking rolls on in and says, I'm going to play tomorrow.
[39:46.12]I'd rather somebody like that actually wants to do it and is into it, really, to get that spot, you know?
[39:51.56]Don't crush any fucking Pikmin, I swear to God.
[39:55.77]There is no line.
[39:57.67]Oh.
[39:58.85]Okay.
[40:00.67]Cool.
[40:18.53]I don't know what that thing is, but we're just going to leave.
[40:20.61]I don't know what that is, but we're going to leave.
[40:32.41]Don't ever do GTA RP.
[40:33.77]Well, I haven't done it because I haven't... I've never had, like, really the... I never... I don't know.
[40:39.97]I just... I wasn't really that into it before.
[40:44.29]But it could be fun to do for a little bit.
[40:52.63]Those guys look like they're electricity.
[40:54.11]I don't know, but I'm going to say they are and make myself feel better by using electricity guys to fight those.
[41:01.00]Alright, what are you?
[41:13.43]What do you do?
[41:18.83]Are they friendly?
[41:24.09]Oh, fuck, he did me.
[41:30.23]Back up, back up, back up.
[41:31.42]Everyone follow me.
[41:32.02]He was just going over here.
[41:38.24]Okay.
[41:49.31]I guess I'm going to take the yellow over there.
[41:53.26]Just to see... Are you electricity?
[41:55.30]I feel like you might... It's a... They're jellyfishes?
[41:57.94]I don't know.
[42:03.70]Do something.
[42:04.18]What are their moves?
[42:06.97]Do a move.
[42:08.77]They do a big suck.
[42:12.61]They just do a big suck.
[42:13.89]That's it?
[42:14.25]They don't have electricity?
[42:16.95]It's a big suck.
[42:17.59]Okay.
[42:20.78]I guess they're not electricity.
[42:22.40]Alright, well, we gotta... Alright, I gotta... I don't want to fucking kill everybody.
[42:25.70]Come on, turn, turn, turn.
[42:28.79]Let's go.
[42:30.53]Uh, everybody, let's do it.
[42:32.43]Follow me.
[42:37.83]We're going in.
[42:41.68]Dude, please don't kill everybody.
[42:43.30]Please don't kill everybody.
[42:44.02]Please don't kill everybody.
[42:55.17]I... Oh my god, I don't know where they are!
[42:59.09]Oh, he died.
[43:15.90]Back up, back up, back up!
[43:20.86]Fuck!
[43:21.78]I'm missing a few people.
[43:22.66]Where are they?
[43:33.19]Oh, fuck.
[43:38.99]Why are they just sitting around?
[43:40.82]Stop sitting around.
[43:41.58]They're dying?
[43:54.53]Whatever.
[43:54.93]Eat it and die.
[43:55.61]Get a bad stomachache.
[44:02.21]Okay, I'm going to
[44:18.61]Weigh it down.
[44:19.39]Weigh it down.
[44:19.91]Weigh it down.
[44:20.41]Weigh it down.
[44:20.93]Weigh it down.
[44:29.56]Overwhelming power.
[44:30.58]Overwhelming numbers.
[44:31.68]Good.
[44:32.12]There we go.
[44:32.64]Okay.
[44:33.64]Now this is safe.
[44:39.56]Okay.
[44:44.00]Bring that guy back.
[44:44.80]Bring this guy back.
[44:45.44]We're looking for treasure.
[44:49.03]spun out of control.
[44:50.01]That's a bigger one.
[44:52.12]That's literally a Jerma985 enemy.
[44:56.54]I don't know what it is, and it's freaking me out.
[45:00.16]In fact, I think that's on my old logo on YouTube.
[45:02.70]I think that's the exact creature.
[45:11.77]Okay, it just has a mega suck.
[45:14.31]That's what it does.
[45:16.35]So we have to overwhelm it, I guess.
[45:18.61]It's a mega suck.
[45:22.17]I don't know.
[45:22.63]I guess I'm just going to go for it.
[45:33.81]Watch out!
[45:34.15]He's going to mega suck.
[45:34.81]He's going to do the mega suck.
[45:35.69]Everyone run.
[45:36.17]Okay, now go.
[45:40.33]Move, move, move.
[45:40.91]He's going to mega suck.
[45:54.76]Kill it.
[45:56.56]Okay.
[46:00.12]Oh, shit.
[46:00.46]He dropped a... Nice.
[46:02.14]Alright.
[46:02.40]We got two treasures here.
[46:03.20]We got a makeup kit and she shells.
[46:06.44]Cool.
[46:10.05]This one's kind of big.
[46:13.21]Alright.
[46:13.53]Let's take this down.
[46:14.47]What's over here?
[46:16.73]Oh, there's like a tin cannon here.
[46:24.22]Louie, you go collect everybody.
[46:28.38]Do it.
[46:32.62]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[46:34.38]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[46:36.26]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[46:38.04]She sells seashells by the seashore.
[46:39.54]Oh, good.
[46:43.20]I almost lost it a few times.
[46:54.35]I almost lost it twice.
[46:55.25]Come on, Louie.
[47:04.12]Get it.
[47:05.50]Oh, that's cute.
[47:06.34]I love that.
[47:08.04]I love how that's just a top of a soda.
[47:19.05]Is this person there?
[47:20.43]Remember, I really enjoy your content, even if your IQ is room temperature at best.
[47:23.35]But in loving your material, I've come to realize it's not about you, because who cares about you, really?
[47:27.19]It's my birthday.
[47:27.89]So yeah, you should kind of like, I don't know, maybe wish me a happy birthday.
[47:30.58]What the fuck?
[47:42.95]Aww.
[47:43.81]You guys are...
[47:52.49]Ban that guy.
[47:53.07]We got like a couple of bans today going around.
[47:55.73]What's going on here?
[48:04.53]Why won't he say happy birthday?
[48:08.02]Because I get to decide who I say happy birthday to.
[48:12.70]This isn't cameo.
[48:17.34]Whoa!
[48:30.87]Where is everybody?
[48:31.65]He didn't kill anybody.
[48:34.79]What?
[48:35.31]He didn't kill anyone.
[48:36.72]I think I just got glitched.
[48:38.00]I think I just got saved by the cutscene.
[48:40.86]The cutscene actually saved their life.
[48:43.20]Wow, that's unbelievable.
[48:44.40]Okay.
[48:50.91]Cool.
[48:51.75]Alright, we're good.
[49:02.96]Happy birthday.
[49:12.27]Okay, so that's good.
[49:13.23]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:14.15]There's an egg here.
[49:14.97]I want to have people drink.
[49:17.55]I want someone to slurp.
[49:21.73]Because I want... Where was that?
[49:26.76]I saw it.
[49:26.96]There was an egg somewhere, wasn't there?
[49:27.90]Does this show up on the map?
[49:32.55]Did the egg show up on the map?
[49:35.39]No, where was it?
[49:39.82]Isn't there an egg?
[49:40.36]Am I losing my mind?
[49:43.18]Or is there an egg?
[49:47.69]You dick.
[49:59.96]Watch out, there's another suck demon in that other room.
[50:02.26]Yeah.
[50:03.40]There it is.
[50:06.89]I swear to God, there was a... Am I going crazy?
[50:18.10]Well, whatever.
[50:18.56]Let's just go.
[50:35.76]Do I have to go across the water?
[50:38.60]Whatever, I guess we... I wanted... Oh my god, guys.
[50:44.88]I tried to separate them.
[50:46.61]I'm so glad they fixed that in Pikmin Spree.
[50:54.67]Fuck.
[50:55.39]I have to bring him over here.
[50:57.86]Over here.
[51:08.90]Come get me.
[51:30.99]Can these guys meet?
[51:31.99]Can I make it if I throw them?
[51:34.14]Can I throw the purple guys this far?
[51:39.90]I can.
[51:40.34]Alright.
[51:40.76]So you guys just... You guys take care of this shit.
[51:48.22]Catboy.
[51:50.09]What are we going to get?

[52:08.93]I only have one date to give you and it's March 6th.
[52:11.53]And that is for the archaeology stream.
[52:20.07]That's the only date I have for you right now.
[52:21.29]I need to reschedule it.
[52:29.97]I'm working then.
[52:32.25]Um... It'll be available.
[52:38.66]When are you going to play Slime Rancher?
[52:39.58]We're playing Slime Rancher tomorrow.
[52:44.42]Tomorrow is Slime Rancher.
[52:45.42]Alright, pull this out.
[52:51.05]I don't like this camera.
[52:51.69]Someone's going to jump out of the... I'm going to get jump scared.
[52:53.67]It would definitely not be this long of a hallway.
[52:59.63]Someone's going to jump out and attack us.
[53:03.63]I'm getting the purple ones ready.
[53:05.07]I know it's going to happen.
[53:08.90]Fucking maggot lair.
[53:11.40]I'm going to run right into a bunch of those big swarm bee things.
[53:18.65]This is a... Hold on, wait.
[53:27.83]Should I be doing this?
[53:28.42]Wait, where are they going?
[53:31.38]Where are you going?
[53:31.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:32.80]Don't just go... Don't just run around without...
[53:40.80]Where are they going?
[53:41.88]Okay.
[53:42.10]They dropped down here.
[53:43.84]What do the flowers give you?
[53:52.93]Just cash.
[53:53.41]Oh, cool.
[53:53.65]Alright.
[53:55.35]Ooh, nice.
[53:57.35]Drink up.
[53:59.63]This game is really fun.
[54:01.21]Alright.
[54:05.13]So this is yellow.
[54:06.13]I think it's just changing colors.
[54:07.88]Okay.
[54:09.12]What do I need?
[54:09.74]Well, I need blue.
[54:12.75]Get rid of some red.
[54:13.33]I want... I want... I need blue.
[54:15.05]I... Oh, God fucking damn it.
[54:34.45]I let go prematurely.
[54:36.43]Holding down trigger with my index finger and holding down A with my thumb and like aiming forward.
[54:43.60]I just let it go.
[54:44.40]I was like, wait.
[54:46.19]I did this stupid thing where you have Google fucking authenticator.
[54:49.69]And you just... You think you have time to type it in.
[54:53.66]Whatever.
[54:54.34]Then the code changes.
[54:55.36]I don't know.
[54:55.64]Whatever.
[54:55.90]It's fucking dumb.
[55:12.00]I got so many- that was just a- that was a- I was so pissed about that.
[55:17.42]Alright, don't fuck that one up.
[55:18.76]If that- if I fuck that one up again, I'm gonna be upset.
[55:20.94]I'm gonna be very mad.
[55:23.48]I want- we're going to throw a red one in here because we just got a major surplus of red Pikmin.
[55:30.03]I'll get up there.
[55:38.31]Okay.
[55:45.59]Thank you.
[55:50.01]Plant.
[55:58.40]10k added to the debt for every Pikmin dying.
[56:00.74]What do I get out of that?
[56:01.80]I just increase my debt.
[56:03.24]I don't get anything out of that.
[56:04.10]Okay, now we need... I'm with the rest of the crew.
[56:12.16]Go get him.
[56:12.48]Go get him.
[56:19.38]I gotta go all the way around?
[56:22.89]Wait, what?
[56:25.99]This sucks.
[56:32.72]30k remove for every treasure.
[56:34.28]No, that's not worth it.
[56:35.54]I'm gonna be losing... I'll be losing way too many Pikmin.
[56:40.58]You didn't get anything with the initial bet either.
[56:47.15]Well, I did.
[56:48.07]I got absolute, total narcissism.
[56:53.34]And just being a facetious asshole.
[56:57.88]That's what I got out of it.
[56:58.68]Okay.
[57:08.53]We're all together again.
[57:14.87]Got free content for like a year.
[57:16.67]I guess that too.
[57:23.87]Is this technically water?
[57:24.75]They don't drown in this, right?
[57:28.21]You're not going to drown in this, are you?
[57:29.60]Okay.
[57:34.80]Oh, there's a leaf in there.
[57:36.04]Is it?
[57:45.20]That's a marijuana leaf.

[62:18.13]Yes.
[62:21.77]Saved him.
[62:23.38]I think they suffocated inside of his body.
[62:32.80]They're dead.
[62:33.38]Well, I'm sorry.
[62:35.50]You can't save every Pikmin.
[62:41.61]I need more.
[62:42.21]Do I have any spray?
[62:43.19]Alright.
[62:45.66]I'm going to have to go on a spray mission tomorrow.
[62:48.44]Tomorrow, the goal is to get at least two or three sprays or something.
[62:51.89]I need to get... Half my team is default tea leaf.
[62:56.51]I need flower.
[62:57.87]Okay, watch the fuck out.
[62:59.27]Watch out.
[62:59.83]Watch the fuck out.
[63:01.07]Good.
[63:02.05]Okay, now... Weigh him down.
[63:10.85]Why did I not have purple selected?
[63:12.23]I thought I did.
[63:14.28]Why did I not have purple selected?
[63:15.24]I had purple selected.
[63:16.00]What the hell was that?
[63:16.52]Because they're all so damn slow.
[63:21.67]They're all so slow.
[63:22.81]It's unbelievable.
[63:24.01]I got rocket boots and they don't have rocket boots?
[63:32.19]Run!
[63:32.61]Oh my god, this room sucks.
[63:41.92]Get up here!
[63:55.23]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[63:56.51]Alright, well, he's in the other room as our opportunity to kill these guys one by one.
[64:01.41]OK, honestly.
[64:06.67]I'm.
[64:12.48]Aiming with the Wiimote.
[64:14.20]Seriously, like it's like, you know, like this console aiming like analog gaming, like console aiming.
[64:22.28]This is like a next level version of console aiming.
[64:25.91]It's because my brain knows exactly where it wants to go.
[64:28.99]And it's kind of like a mouse.
[64:30.17]The control is kind of good.
[64:31.75]But it's almost like there's like a person in my brain.
[64:34.87]And in my arm.
[64:35.67]Like holding my hands back.
[64:37.33]And just putting a wall up in my brain.
[64:43.60]It's such a horrible in-between of console aiming and mouse.
[65:04.67]I'm not running out of purples, am I?
[65:06.47]Alright, let him bait it out.
[65:09.17]Go ahead.
[65:09.47]Alright, get in.
[65:13.71]I had purple selected.
[65:17.79]Is there a way that I can make it so it does not select another Pikmin?
[65:22.57]I can lock this shit in.
[65:23.88]It's so annoying.
[65:25.42]I don't even care if I don't have enough.
[65:27.48]I know it's because they're not behind me, but I don't want to select another one and throw it.
[65:38.60]Get to the... Just don't miss the first row.
[65:55.85]I feel like I'm cleaning somebody else's teeth, okay?
[65:59.13]That's how I've always felt using a Wiimote with a game that requires this.
[66:14.65]Really do I'm like a fucking dentist holding my hand up like aiming leaning forward with a little device I have to be very careful very intricate lean forward move twist small wrist movement And I can't put it on I can't rest my arm See this is a mouse if I could have it on the ground and moving around like why can't I why can't it be mouse mode?
[66:35.06]The Wiimote should have a mouse mode Convince me that I'm wrong They would have sold billions
[66:53.98]You're just doing a trump voice?
[66:55.37]I was?
[66:55.79]Was I?
[66:56.09]I wasn't even aware of it.
[67:19.69]Literally, no.
[67:20.63]Oh, what?
[67:27.22]That was good.
[67:36.18]Go this way.
[67:38.50]No, I... Is there a dig?
[67:40.14]I feel like there's something on the ground here.
[67:44.02]Yeah, there is, right?
[67:45.81]No.
[67:46.07]Alright, up there.
[68:02.68]Get over here.
[68:03.20]Why do you all have to do that?
[68:08.98]Can't you just run over here?
[68:10.67]Come here.
[68:10.99]Are you getting stuck in the sand?
[68:20.16]Yeah, Olimar and Louie run too fast now.
[68:23.58]Ever since I got those boots upgrade, I don't like the boot upgrades.
[68:25.88]Can I take them off?
[68:28.16]I'm running too fast.
[68:29.32]I'm just losing the Pikmin.
[68:30.42]How come they don't get the speed upgrade?
[68:36.12]Hey, careful.
[68:43.23]Can he jump?
[68:45.49]I was going to say, can he jump over the fence?
[68:46.65]That would be horrible.
[68:51.85]It's fire.
[68:52.35]Alright, well we got fire and... Okay, two fire and one polywog.
[69:02.08]God.
[69:03.90]He's gonna jump over that fence and I'm gonna be so mad.
[69:06.18]Alright, pull everybody back here.
[69:07.16]I don't wanna kill everyone.
[69:09.85]Hang out back here.
[69:10.45]Hang out back here.
[69:14.81]We're gonna do purple and red.
[69:16.41]That's the only ones I want.
[69:23.40]Okay.
[69:25.20]Let's try to get through here.
[69:34.89]I'm so concerned about this dude.
[69:40.69]Pull him over here.
[69:41.28]Come on.
[69:45.04]Dope.
[69:45.38]Come on.
[69:45.98]You can do it.
[69:52.48]You idiot.
[69:54.67]They're gonna get burnt by this guy.
[69:58.55]If I throw them over here, he's gonna kill them.
[70:00.35]Because he's gonna jump on them.
[70:02.57]Alright, come here.
[70:07.20]Just kill it?
[70:08.08]Yeah, I don't want all my purples to get burnt to death.
[70:10.44]I'm trying to get them down the hall.
[70:14.77]There we go.
[70:15.25]Alright, there we go.
[70:21.70]You got one.
[70:22.62]You crushed one.
[70:23.14]It's okay.
[70:24.72]And I will lose one red to get rid of these things.
[70:26.98]Alright.
[70:27.24]Now we're going to go easy.
[70:42.93]Watch out.
[70:46.15]Kill.
[70:48.54]Kill one for the kill.
[70:50.26]Good.
[70:50.63]Nice work, guys.
[70:51.37]Excellent job.
[70:51.87]Same deal.
[71:01.05]Don't throw all the reds because I'll actually... Good.
[71:04.69]Is potty humor in chat?
[71:08.11]Well... What am I going to tell you?
[71:12.03]It's disgusting.
[71:12.79]How dare you?
[71:19.33]Okay.
[71:20.95]There is a treasure up here buried.
[71:22.11]I know it.
[71:22.62]Got this process.
[71:24.76]Cool.
[71:25.08]I lost one guy.
[71:25.66]That's good.
[71:27.78]This chat is sometimes so goofy.
[71:29.70]It is.
[71:30.00]Yeah.
[71:34.86]But the way that I see it is I'm kind of like a gremlin that got wet after midnight or ate after midnight, whatever it is.
[71:46.73]You guys kind of just sprouted out from that, I think.
[71:59.41]I've said the words, like, poo-poo and stuff on this stream.
[72:05.15]So, I ate, like, a bunch of nachos after midnight.
[72:08.23]Like, I've done that before.
[72:09.57]I know I have.
[72:22.09]say it again again again do it again I'll do it again you want to hear it again I'll do it again I promise oh it's just the water okay there's no uh I can't dig well we're just gonna throw them over come on up here blue
[72:52.06]Go get it.
[72:55.94]Say it.
[72:56.20]Okay, I'm going to say it and then I want everyone to relax.
[73:08.93]You guys going to relax if I say it?
[73:19.22]No.
[73:19.98]Then I'm not going to say it then if you're not going to relax.
[73:31.99]I think so I try to be I try to be a good boy I don't think I've ever really tried to be like a bad boy which I think look I think you try your best right everybody wants to be a good boy you just try just try to be a good boy right that's it
[74:00.82]What about when you murdered random people in Red Dead Redemption?
[74:09.08]So what?
[74:10.84]Why?
[74:11.06]What a specific thing to say.
[74:12.10]Oh, like you're a good boy.
[74:15.38]You murdered that guy in Red Dead Redemption.
[74:20.93]um I guess like I may have like killed like a civilian in Red Dead Redemption and you've got you've been on that you've been stuck on that for like a year two years you think you're such a good boy what about that time that you shot that guy in Red Dead Redemption I haven't forgotten you have oh yeah when you were playing Grand Theft Auto that time and you drove on the sidewalk accidentally and you hit that pedestrian
[74:53.36]Don't act like you're so good, Mr. Elbertson.
[74:56.92]We know.
[74:57.32]Okay.
[74:58.38]Are you going to do a personality test on stream?
[75:09.51]We did that not that long ago.
[75:12.49]We did a whole bunch of quizzes and tests a few months ago.
[75:27.70]Do more.
[75:28.50]I want to do more tier lists.
[75:29.30]I love tier lists.
[75:30.86]I've done so many tier lists, but I feel like there's so much more things to rank.
[75:33.80]You know what I'm saying?
[75:40.05]I love doing those.
[75:40.79]It's so much fun.
[75:50.95]Just a white flower.
[75:52.01]Okay.
[75:54.33]The Pikmin tier list.
[75:55.85]Okay, sure.
[75:56.49]I don't need a tier list for that.
[75:57.64]I can just tell you right now.
[75:59.90]Um, I kind of need to look at them.
[76:03.82]Need a good look.
[76:07.32]Purple S. Purple S, yellow A. Red and blue B. And then white, like C or D tier.
[76:26.20]Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[76:31.71]Speaking of red, let's get a red in there.
[76:40.67]The maker has spoken.
[76:45.69]What about the Bulbmans?
[76:49.18]I mean, those are S+, but they're not a Pikmin.
[76:55.92]I mean, if we're ranking just Pikmin characters, just Pikmin monsters, or just any character in Pikmin, then sure, the bulbs would be up really high.
[77:10.13]Hey.
[77:10.81]Hey!
[77:11.57]Get that back.
[77:12.01]I don't know what this thing does, but get away.
[77:19.15]It's poison.
[77:19.65]Thank God I ran everybody away.
[77:20.93]Holy shit, I just saved everybody's life.
[77:22.18]Did you see that?
[77:23.64]That was very, very lucky.
[77:30.12]I thought it was purple Pikmin.
[77:31.10]I thought it was super strong or something.
[77:39.94]I almost had a Snapple.
[77:41.76]Wait, does it have a joke?
[77:42.42]Come on, it has to have a piece of life advice or a joke underneath.
[77:54.99]Get gone.
[77:55.55]What's over here?
[77:56.41]Another wall?
[77:59.93]Um... What's the point of this?
[78:09.76]Okay.
[78:12.38]Uh... Yep.
[78:14.38]Okay.
[78:14.58]It's one of these guys.
[78:15.20]Holy shit.
[78:18.46]Nice.
[78:19.02]Don't let him get away.
[78:19.58]Get it again.
[78:21.60]Oh my god.
[78:22.26]He's gonna feed the whole... Whoa!
[78:28.92]Is everybody alright?
[78:39.79]I... Whatever, I don't care.
[78:40.89]Did they already drink it?
[78:47.75]I think a bunch of them already drank the other ones.
[78:52.42]Okay.
[79:01.70]Nothing's going to be buried in one of these.
[79:02.82]I mean, that's a fact, right?
[79:06.16]It's just a fact.
[79:07.24]Watch out.
[79:08.44]Oh, that's an electric bug.
[79:10.32]It's an electric bug.
[79:12.66]I think.
[79:13.20]I don't know.
[79:20.94]Kill him.
[79:21.74]Okay.
[79:26.01]Don't steal anybody.
[79:28.99]Did he get anybody?
[79:35.05]It's so nerve-wracking.
[79:36.23]It really is.
[79:36.84]This is the most nerve-wracking game.
[79:40.24]Because you don't want anyone to die, but you know they will.
[79:46.15]Get him!
[79:46.43]Get him!
[79:46.63]Get him!
[79:47.05]Surround him!
[79:56.26]Big guy over there.
[79:57.02]Alright, now where's the treasure?
[79:58.68]It's buried.
[79:59.30]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[80:00.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[80:01.82]Do not fight.
[80:02.71]Do not fight.
[80:03.49]Do not fight.
[80:04.07]Run away.
[80:04.59]It's a bomb.
[80:04.95]That's a bomb.
[80:05.41]That's a bomb.
[80:10.63]Jesus.
[80:12.35]Where is that guy?
[80:12.89]Alright, let's gas.
[80:21.18]Oh.
[80:26.78]Excellent job.
[80:31.00]Birthday's tomorrow?
[80:34.52]Oh, teeth.
[80:43.10]Please turn into a funny voice to chat, please.
[80:46.70]No.
[80:48.58]Nope.
[80:49.84]I'm not going to do that.
[80:50.64]I don't just get to demand stuff from me.
[80:59.38]That's 10,000.
[81:00.08]I think I got it.
[81:00.64]Behemoth jaw.
[81:03.76]I got $10,000.
[81:05.48]I have enough to pay off the debt.
[81:09.80]Cool.
[81:10.10]Alright.
[81:10.94]So let's get that paid.
[81:12.18]Alright.
[81:16.96]We got this big guy in the way.
[81:18.16]We got to overwhelm him with purples.
[81:19.63]In one, two...
[81:34.63]Run away!
[81:39.68]Fuck!
[81:42.90]Oh my god!
[81:48.18]I couldn't throw him above his head?
[81:49.84]I was trying to get people to land on his head.
[81:52.67]Wait, he catches them in the mouth or something?
[81:58.57]I thought the purples didn't matter.
[81:59.99]The purples were too heavy.
[82:00.75]I don't know.
[82:07.34]I thought if you get hit in the face with the purple, then it just knocks you out for a sec.
[82:10.66]You have to actually land them, like, on top of their butt.
[82:12.88]Not, like, on their head.
[82:14.54]Oh, well.
[82:17.04]Well, I'm okay.
[82:21.06]I wouldn't be... I don't think I could even attack that guy from the back.
[82:23.80]Look at how small the hallway was.
[82:24.74]He would have just woken up.
[82:25.44]Maybe I should just put poison in front of him.
[82:28.28]What the hell was that?
[82:38.09]God, I hate those things.
[82:49.51]I would love it if this thing... I'm holding it so steady.
[82:54.78]It's braced against my fucking chest.
[83:02.50]God fucking damn it.
[83:16.84]Watch out!
[83:28.98]Move out of the way!
[83:34.14]This controller, I swear to God, is shaking just to piss me off now.
[83:41.89]Oh my God, why?
[84:00.34]Put up two birthday candles.
[84:03.06]And throw this like 40 cent piece of plastic they put in the fucking box in the trash.
[84:06.70]That's what I should do.
[84:14.37]But I won't.
[84:22.53]I'm just going to complain about how bad the tracking is on this thing.
[84:26.10]I'm just going to whine about it and just be whiny and say, oh, why is the tracking so bad?
[84:32.86]Jeremy, just put up two candles.
[84:35.18]No.
[84:36.37]That'll probably fix it.
[84:37.59]No.
[84:38.69]No, I don't want to.
[84:40.91]Okay, well then stop complaining about it.
[84:42.47]No, I'm going to.
[84:43.07]I paid for this.
[84:43.81]I used my good money to buy this.
[84:45.71]Okay.
[84:46.33]Okay.
[85:01.19]You did a funny voice.
[85:02.09]We win.
[85:02.49]Were you betting on that?
[85:04.03]I didn't even notice.
[85:04.75]Was it a prediction?
[85:06.74]Will I do a funny voice in the next 10 minutes?
[85:11.50]Hey.
[85:13.32]That's not a bad one to do.
[85:15.90]Okay.
[85:17.24]Let's go.
[85:17.54]What are you willing to bet on that?
[85:20.96]Can I not do a like jokey in quotes voice for 10 straight minutes?
[85:27.47]What do you think?
[85:28.41]Is it something you want to bet on?
[85:36.77]That's easy money.
[85:38.09]I don't know.
[85:38.45]Is it though?
[85:38.85]10 full minutes.
[85:43.98]Let's do it.
[85:44.96]Put it on.
[85:45.42]Put it on there.
[86:10.66]No emotion for 10 minutes.
[86:16.64]No, it's no jokey voices for 10 minutes.
[86:35.43]Define a funny voice.
[86:39.41]Okay, a funny voice is defined as one that is very, very far away from my speaking voice.
[86:47.17]One that is so detached from my normal speaking voice like this.
[86:51.39]Like, okay, yo, this is stupid.
[86:52.97]The Wiimote sucks.
[86:54.17]The Wiimote's a piece of shit.
[86:55.62]That's normal, right?
[86:57.72]I'm talking about like... By the way, this hasn't started yet.
[87:00.80]I'm talking about like...
[87:03.04]Oh, I'm the guy that designed the Nintendo Wii mode.
[87:05.52]And I said that the infrared technology was the best.
[87:07.98]And they were wrong.
[87:08.48]They were completely wrong.
[87:09.96]So, like, that would be a jokey voice, right?
[87:12.32]Like, as if I was going to do, like, an impression of that.
[87:17.60]No, it hasn't started.
[87:18.28]No, no, no.
[87:18.52]I said it hasn't started yet.
[87:20.89]It starts when I say go.
[87:26.99]So, when I say go, it starts.
[87:29.37]We're talking any jokey kind of voice that's very detached from the way I'm speaking normally.
[87:33.69]Okay?
[87:37.96]We're gonna begin this after the betting starts, by the way.
[87:41.58]I'm not gonna do this until the betting is closed.
[87:46.36]Yeah, it starts when the bet closes.
[87:54.85]Will he do a funny voice in the next 10 minutes?
[87:59.95]God, I don't know.
[88:09.17]I'm not.
[88:09.47]Okay.
[88:10.01]It starts the second that I say go.
[88:20.29]Not yet.
[88:21.09]Not yet.
[88:21.47]I'm going to try.
[88:23.35]Those of you that are betting with me.
[88:29.80]I'm gonna try.
[88:31.24]Trust me, I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[88:34.16]Oh, nice.
[88:38.74]Okay, remember, this is my speaking voice.
[88:41.47]I can get loud, and I can be annoyed.
[88:43.15]I can say like, I fucking threw the purple Pikmin on his head.
[88:46.37]What's going on here?
[88:48.19]That's not a funny voice.
[88:49.69]That's my normal speaking voice, but like a little elevated.
[88:51.83]You know what I'm talking about.
[88:58.02]Killed him.
[89:05.27]Okay, here we go.
[89:05.79]Ready?
[89:07.98]It begins now.
[89:15.10]I'm looking over and I'm seeing people really desperately trying to get me to do stuff.
[89:19.46]Not going to happen.
[89:20.79]I'm just a normal guy.
[89:21.79]I'm just a regular person.
[89:24.85]Just like you.
[89:26.13]I'm just hanging out and playing Pikmin.
[89:28.82]Pikmin 2, actually.
[89:31.16]You and I are just hanging out together.
[89:32.98]You and me are just hanging out in the same chat room.
[89:36.30]Just watching TV together.
[89:38.33]And hanging out.
[89:43.57]That thing is gigantic, whatever that is.
[89:46.65]Very large.
[89:51.24]I don't know what that thing does.
[89:54.02]But I think a lot of people are going to die.
[89:57.60]I have to hit... Okay, he's got a red thing on his tail.
[90:02.31]I hit the red tail, I think.
[90:04.41]Does he fire?
[90:04.99]I don't know.
[90:07.45]He's got these weird eye things.
[90:08.55]Alright, everybody stay back.
[90:14.53]Lamar, go check it out.
[90:15.89]Alright, we got one yellow.
[90:18.11]He's tracking.
[90:19.48]He's tracking.
[90:20.12]He's tracking.
[90:21.48]He tracks them.
[90:22.98]And then what does he do?
[90:24.80]He's doing his tracking beam.
[90:27.82]He does a tracking beam.
[90:35.61]Okay, then he gets really angry and goes forward.
[90:40.93]What about, should I go on his head?
[90:43.57]And they land on his head.
[90:44.39]They cannot.
[90:46.69]And they cannot hurt him.
[90:48.23]What about, how do you injure him?
[90:49.78]His eyes?
[90:51.54]Okay, well, he got one.
[90:53.30]It's got to be the butt.
[90:55.54]It's definitely the butt.
[91:06.81]It's not the butt?
[91:13.81]How do you fight this guy?
[91:23.82]Land on... Why won't he land on his tail?
[91:28.14]Am I just missing?
[91:32.39]What the fuck?
[91:39.01]Get on his tail!
[91:42.93]Dude, this seems insanely difficult to do this.
[91:47.75]I'm actually trying so hard to get around his tail.
[91:55.18]Oops.
[91:57.92]You got him.
[91:58.30]Okay.
[92:00.48]Oh, no.
[92:00.88]He's got... Wait till he opens his mouth?
[92:04.78]I don't know what to do.
[92:08.72]Overwhelm his tail?
[92:16.12]He's gonna skewer everybody.
[92:22.35]No, that shit ain't the... Oh, whoa!
[92:28.87]Whoa, he just wanted... He's gonna have health now.
[92:42.04]It was because he ate the white Pikmin.
[92:43.26]Oh my god, don't come down here.
[92:52.06]That doesn't count.
[92:52.68]I went, whoa, in my normal speaking voice.
[93:01.82]Do not skewer.
[93:04.86]Alright, just eat them.
[93:06.76]I don't understand this guy.
[93:10.70]Just have them eat those.
[93:12.98]Don't come down here.
[93:15.78]Eat them.
[93:20.61]He's healing.
[93:24.17]okay honest to god I don't understand this guy nobody can do anything to him he follows the captain you're controlling I thought he's well now what do I do

[95:00.07]This boss is stupid.
[95:07.04]Hang around.
[95:12.55]He's dead?
[95:39.95]That doesn't count.
[95:40.59]That doesn't count.
[95:41.15]That doesn't count.
[95:41.55]That doesn't count.
[95:42.07]That doesn't count.
[95:42.73]That doesn't count.
[95:43.53]That was not a funny voice.
[95:44.55]That was a screaming voice.
[95:46.02]That was not a funny voice.
[95:48.56]Was it a funny voice?
[95:49.84]Maybe it was a little funny, but it wasn't intentional funny.
[95:53.20]It wasn't intentional funny.
[95:54.36]It was not intentional funny.
[95:56.61]I wasn't trying to do that.
[95:59.15]Oh my... Does that count?
[96:02.95]It counts, but...
[96:07.14]intention cannot be recorded but I I don't know we need some deliberation here was that
[96:34.23]die that wasn't a voice was it not a voice I don't know just I'm so sick of this boss alright I'm good what do you got a plate a bowl oh what's happening it doesn't count okay does it not count
[97:11.91]What do we think?
[97:13.39]I don't know.
[97:14.05]I need some deliberation Is a weird scream a funny voice or is that a weird scream?
[97:22.59]That does not count.
[97:24.03]No, I don't need any more deliberations.
[97:26.75]That does not count.
[97:27.35]That was me screaming weirdly.
[97:30.58]Me doing a voice would be like me saying, you know, put on a thing, right?
[97:35.10]Okay, does not count.
[97:37.58]That was me screaming weirdly.
[97:41.34]By the way, I don't... What is this?
[97:43.32]It was a funny scream.
[97:51.77]funny scream I don't think it counts though is it on technicality does that count it's a speaker oh
[98:15.03]Just refund it?
[98:16.79]Alright, refund it.
[98:17.87]Refund it out.
[98:18.59]Refund it.
[98:18.91]We're gonna do it again.
[98:19.43]We're gonna do it again.
[98:21.41]This time... This time... That was a scream.
[98:27.48]That was not a funny voice.
[98:29.28]A funny voice is me, like, impersonating somebody.
[98:31.26]Or, like, doing somebody.
[98:33.20]Like, I'm doing somebody's voice.
[98:36.12]A scream, me screaming weirdly, is not a funny voice.
[98:38.96]It's a me screaming strangely.
[98:40.62]So I'm gonna help.
[98:41.44]Here's what's gonna happen.
[98:43.31]We're going to refund it.
[98:44.96]Refund those points.
[98:45.60]We're going to do it again.
[98:46.70]And the next one is going to be... This is funny voices.
[99:00.75]Just don't scream.
[99:08.50]you shouldn't be able to be the one that decides well but people what you want the people to decide they're gonna vote based on how they bet that you don't go to like a va a table in Las Vegas and have it land on a roulette table have it land on like red too
[99:34.22]and have them guy- okay guys, it landed on Red 2, uh, but, we're gonna vote on the table on whether or not I should- we should be paid out or not.
[99:43.16]Should it have landed on Red 2?
[99:44.78]What do you guys think?
[99:46.42]The one guy that, when it landed on Red 2, the one guy at the table's gonna be like, yes, abso-fucking-lutely, it landed on Red 2, I wanna be paid out!
[99:54.63]And all the other dicks at the table are sitting there going, no, no, no, it doesn't count!
[100:00.09]Oh!
[100:03.42]No, I refunded.
[100:04.72]Fuck, I'm so bad at this.
[100:06.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[100:07.34]I refunded.
[100:07.86]It was over, right?
[100:10.08]No, I refunded it by that point, right?
[100:11.86]I said we hadn't started it.
[100:12.70]We were doing another one.
[100:13.72]It refunded.
[100:17.97]It's been 10 minutes.
[100:18.63]Wait, it's been more than 10 minutes?
[100:22.09]Has it been 10 minutes already?
[100:27.57]Oh, okay.
[100:28.61]Alright, alright, okay.
[100:29.47]So we're good.
[100:30.21]Did we refund?
[100:34.45]My point is that everybody at the table that didn't bet on red two, you got a guy with five grand that he put on black one.
[100:42.53]Yeah, yeah, I think it was a scam.
[100:43.98]I think it was bullshit.
[100:46.56]I vote no, that it doesn't count.
[100:48.88]Of course he does.
[100:49.90]Of course, because he didn't bet that.
[100:52.26]Alright, let's do it again.
[100:53.28]This time with real rules.
[100:55.28]Screams.
[100:59.60]Alright, we're going to vote on this.
[101:06.20]Should a weird scream count as a funny voice?
[101:10.32]I want to make sure I get this right.
[101:16.82]This is very important.
[101:19.56]So you're voting on should it count if I do a weird scream as a scream like weird, a funny voice.
[101:27.03]We're going to get this correct.
[101:27.97]Okay.
[101:41.67]Oh man, this is actually pretty split.
[101:45.39]I'm not on a timer right now.
[101:48.89]Yeah, and by the way, a weird scream is like... Like that's a weird, oh wow, weird scream.
[101:55.24]Like... Did that count as a funny voice?
[102:18.81]Why the fuck is it 50-50?
[102:20.25]Really, guys?
[102:21.87]Did you not decide?
[102:22.75]Is it this hard to do this?
[102:25.15]But all we'll... Alright.
[102:27.33]It might not be a funny voice.
[102:29.51]Not all funny voices are screams, but all screams are funny sounds, which all screams are funny voices.
[102:35.80]What?
[102:36.92]I'm so confused.
[102:37.88]You guys obviously can't figure this out either.
[102:39.44]I'm having trouble too.
[102:40.00]51-49.
[102:40.04]I gotta keep it open.
[102:53.38]Okay, this is getting close.
[102:54.70]I'm going to give it to you again.
[102:56.62]If you haven't voted, you have a very... This is important.
[103:02.77]It's separated by like 15 votes.
[103:04.29]Funny sound does not equal a funny voice.
[103:08.91]Interesting theory.
[103:09.57]That's right.
[103:12.53]But me shaping my vocal cords to make that funny sound is me making funny sounds with my voice.
[103:19.37]So therefore, it could be a funny voice.
[103:20.73]I have no idea.
[103:21.37]This is tricky.
[103:31.73]Are you guys deciding?
[103:32.51]Are you getting close?
[103:34.41]Alright, I've given you the reasons for and the reasons for not.
[103:39.82]Best noise does not equal best impression.
[103:42.98]Good point.
[103:48.34]Okay.
[103:55.77]It's... He's tricking us.
[103:59.48]No, I'm just telling you what people would say about it.
[104:02.60]Alright.
[104:03.18]Okay.
[104:06.02]Okay.
[104:07.20]I'm about to close this poll.
[104:08.30]This is your last chance.
[104:09.02]I'm going to give you... I'm going to give you 20 seconds.
[104:13.58]Last chance.
[104:20.31]Does it count?
[104:21.57]Is a weird, funny scream a funny voice?
[104:30.78]Damn it, it's so- it's too close.
[104:40.35]It wouldn't let me vote.
[104:41.45]I- I can't close the poll until it's very clear.
[104:58.39]Close it.
[104:58.79]I can't close it.
[104:59.67]Look at this.
[105:00.25]Look at this.
[105:02.27]It's separated by like 10 people.
[105:08.03]It's never going to be clear.
[105:13.43]This sucks.
[105:14.69]I'm trying to be democratic about this, but what the hell?
[105:22.04]I should have just flipped a coin.
[105:27.52]Okay.
[105:28.06]Alright.
[105:30.18]In 10 seconds, I'm closing it.
[105:38.20]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[105:42.17]It counts.
[105:42.95]It counts.
[105:43.51]Alright.
[105:43.87]It counts.
[105:44.61]That's when I closed it.
[105:45.45]It counts.
[105:46.61]A funny, weird scream counts as making a funny voice.
[105:50.23]Okay.
[105:50.83]At least for this particular stream.
[105:51.93]Let's go.
[106:03.37]I should just flip the coin.
[106:09.20]By the way, this does not start until the betting is over.
[106:10.82]I need that to be clear.
[106:15.92]Okay.
[106:16.86]I almost just leaned into the mic and did Obama.
[106:25.57]Let me be clear.
[106:27.45]I almost just did that.
[106:28.47]I almost leaned in to do an Obama impression.
[106:31.15]I almost did that.
[106:36.71]But it wouldn't have even counted.
[106:37.57]Yeah, it hasn't counted yet.
[106:47.00]So, I can.
[106:48.36]Until they're all in.
[106:49.88]Alright, let's go.
[106:55.15]Just don't talk.
[106:57.39]Alright.
[107:02.89]You need a colonoscopy, bro.
[107:04.14]I just had one.
[107:04.80]Like, six months ago.
[107:08.94]It's a big haul today.
[107:22.68]Okay, I'm almost ready.
[107:27.40]Just don't talk.
[107:28.72]No, I have to talk.
[107:29.76]That's not fair.
[107:34.49]I'll give you guys some incentive as to being on board or not on board this.
[107:37.93]I have to talk.
[107:39.27]I cannot go more than... I cannot go more than 10 straight seconds in silence.
[107:45.61]Otherwise, it nullifies everything, right?
[107:49.14]Hold on.
[107:49.98]Not yet.
[107:50.22]There's a cutscene.
[107:53.16]Not starting now.
[107:53.70]Okay.
[108:03.05]I want to just do these characters right now, but I can't.
[108:05.67]Okay.
[108:09.73]It's now.
[108:10.45]We're starting now.
[108:11.51]10 minutes.
[108:12.03]Starting now.
[108:14.64]I can read these in my own voice.
[108:25.22]Probably should have put this on the poll.
[108:26.20]I should have asked about this.
[108:27.02]Is doing car engine noises considered a funny voice or is that me imitating a car engine?
[108:37.53]Probably.
[108:41.77]I put Louie.
[108:50.16]Okay.
[108:54.57]Congratulations, Jerma.
[109:09.22]The best part... Wait, what?
[109:11.96]I thought I was... I didn't beat the game.
[109:13.90]I mean, I guess I just beat the game.
[109:15.02]That was a fun game.
[109:17.22]But there's more, right?
[109:21.18]I want it to so badly.
[109:22.60]I'm just putting a, I'm just having to self just sit here and shut and quiet.
[109:28.37]I wanted to say monkaS in the way I can't, I have to, this is weird to do.
[109:35.03]I, I, I'm always doing just weird sounds and stuff.
[109:48.48]You left Louie behind.
[109:49.70]So is that... So Louie stays on the planet and continues to do stuff.
[109:53.31]I love this is real imagery.
[109:57.77]Getting Spongebob vibes from this.
[110:03.36]When they put just real stuff.
[110:14.83]Ahem.
[110:21.09]I'm not going to skip the credits.
[110:21.95]I know everyone wants to see them.
[110:24.37]Yeah, I'm not done.
[110:24.83]I'm going to keep playing.
[110:29.14]You have to save Louie.
[110:30.30]Cool.
[110:34.22]I've seen everybody writing.
[110:35.24]Doy, doy, doy.
[110:38.54]Oh, my goodness.
[110:40.38]The urge to do that right now.
[110:43.88]The urge to just put my hand up to my mouth, push the pinky up, and just do it as hard as I can.
[110:51.81]It's there.
[110:52.43]It's hard.
[110:53.23]It's hard to avoid that.
[111:01.47]I want to do it right now.
[111:05.87]Well, I can't wait till 10 minutes is up and I can just doy, doy, doy for like five straight seconds as hard as I can into my hand.
[111:15.81]Cool.
[111:16.43]Pikmin lost in battle.
[111:17.93]Pikmin lost to fire.
[111:19.59]Zero.
[111:20.03]That's pretty good.
[111:22.01]Can I go through these myself?
[111:25.90]Pikmin born.
[111:27.48]550.
[111:31.80]Yellow Pikmin.
[111:32.90]Blue Pikmin born.
[111:36.58]Total play time, 11 hours and 41 minutes.
[111:39.71]Cool.
[111:41.29]That's cool.
[111:41.95]What?
[111:42.15]Okay.
[111:42.69]I made the most red Pikmin.
[111:45.45]I want to do it so bad.
[111:46.33]So 550 were born, 339 died.
[111:49.57]That's not bad.
[111:50.01]You must resist.
[112:06.81]It's eating away at him.
[112:07.81]It's only been two minutes.
[112:09.39]It's been a little longer than that.
[112:12.17]Resume the expedition and return to the planet.
[112:14.09]Yes.
[112:18.73]Thanks to you, our company has been saved.
[112:21.12]Hurrah.
[112:23.54]What?
[112:24.22]There's still more treasure.
[112:25.64]If we collect it all, we'll be filthy rich.
[112:28.72]Louis.
[112:32.28]Where's Louis?
[112:32.92]What?
[112:33.12]You lost him?
[112:35.14]In that case...
[112:38.26]I shall go.
[112:44.35]Cool.
[112:44.71]Okay.
[112:48.29]Ooh, new.
[112:50.53]This is new.
[112:55.15]Awesome.
[112:59.09]Let's check it out.
[113:00.81]But wait, I want to make sure that I check this out over here.
[113:07.55]I can throw carrots at these guys.
[113:10.73]Do any of them like carrots?
[113:14.39]This one explodes.
[113:19.22]That was wild.
[113:20.90]I can't believe what I just saw.
[113:28.14]Okay.
[113:28.82]This one looks very, very interesting to me.
[113:34.18]I want to read the notes.
[113:37.78]Pretty cool.
[113:42.10]Alright.
[113:47.28]Continue to area selection.
[113:49.95]You can express emotion.
[113:51.33]No, I can't.
[113:52.13]I don't want to.
[113:54.97]I want to land here and check this out.
[113:56.33]Because if I put emotion on, I might go into the Adam Sandler voice.
[114:06.69]Honeyman Monotone.
[114:08.41]I'm trying to win.
[114:16.47]Oh, he is with us now.
[114:23.26]It's trying to get me to do it.
[114:24.22]It's trying to get me to do it.
[114:26.68]It just made the doi doi sound.
[114:27.78]It's trying to get me to do it.
[114:28.52]It wants me to do it so bad.
[114:30.18]I do too.
[114:31.04]I'm going to do it.
[114:32.98]I'm going to do it.
[114:35.64]if it's calling to me I have to do it it's really tricky to not okay hold on we must we shall make pocketate freight the golden indisputable king of deep space long haul freight then everyone will be godly clad in gold like me now I am unique and beautiful yes
[114:57.95]Olimar, I must ask that you take extreme care so as to not insult or endanger our president.
[115:03.06]For now, where could Louis be to be stuck on an uncivilized planet with no food at all?
[115:08.32]I am concerned you must waste no time in finding him.
[115:10.22]How much time do I have?
[115:17.67]Three minutes.
[115:18.65]Easy.
[115:18.99]Done.
[115:21.01]Let's take 30 blues.
[115:25.75]I only have 13.
[115:27.47]13 yellow.
[115:31.33]We need... 40.
[115:34.39]These.
[115:36.38]And then... Oh my god.
[115:40.46]I'm almost out of everything.
[115:45.86]You're so close.
[115:46.68]I know.
[115:47.02]I'm going to get it.
[115:47.96]I'm going to get it.
[115:48.80]That was not a good bet to bet against me.
[115:52.33]Don't ever bet against me again.
[115:55.08]Notice how I didn't lean into the mic and do a lower voice with a little bit of gravel on it.
[115:59.83]I just said, never bet against me again.
[116:01.45]There.
[116:02.99]Normal person.
[116:03.59]Okay.
[116:11.86]Don't eat everybody, please.
[116:13.18]Thank you very much.
[116:13.98]Don't eat them.
[116:15.64]Okay, cool.
[116:18.12]Oh, that's a big dumbbell.
[116:20.28]That's a really cool looking dumbbell.
[116:22.53]I need 1,000 Pikmin to pick that up.
[116:24.85]That seems incredibly hard to do.
[116:27.43]How am I possibly going to have 1,000 Pikmin out?
[116:33.45]That's not... I don't think I can do that.
[116:35.23]I'm not sure that's possible.
[116:38.11]It's 100 purples.
[116:40.53]Very, very interesting.
[116:43.87]I'm not sure I'm going to get that.
[116:46.19]Not on at least on this game session that I'm playing now.
[116:49.83]I need yellow.
[116:52.72]Where's yellow?
[116:54.44]No, no, I told you no, don't get I'm OK.
[117:01.16]This isn't Jerma.
[117:04.78]This is not how this is not you, dude.
[117:08.76]It is me desperately trying to win.
[117:10.57]A game of chess with everybody.
[117:16.91]Time is it right now?
[117:18.05]Oh, yep.
[117:18.35]Did I win?
[117:27.00]No, not yet.
[117:28.00]One minute.
[117:28.60]OK, one minute.
[117:33.80]Go get that.
[117:34.22]Alright, watch out for this guy.
[117:37.06]You dickhead.
[117:37.90]Get on top of him and get him down.
[117:42.58]Surround him, swarm him.
[117:43.48]Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
[117:47.60]Excellent job.
[117:48.16]Got him.
[117:50.36]Done.
[117:52.94]I want yellow to pick these up, please.
[117:54.40]Thank you very much.
[117:57.75]Yellow, pick that up.
[118:00.65]Two more of these yellows over here and a yellow on that one, too.
[118:03.21]Okay.
[118:12.66]Great.
[118:12.98]Watch out.
[118:13.36]There is something up there.
[118:16.24]This voice is funny.
[118:22.57]It's not.
[118:29.07]Time, time.
[118:29.89]Oh, is it time?
[118:31.35]Yes.
[118:31.79]Oh.
[118:31.85]Look what I can do.
[118:39.65]Look what I can do now.
[118:40.40]Don't get crushed by this thing.
[118:42.36]Don't get crushed.
[118:42.94]Hold on.
[118:45.29]Look what I get to do.
[118:51.23]Hi, it's me, Bernie Sanders.
[118:57.81]And I was gonna say, I can't believe that Jeremy actually did it.
[119:00.87]He got to the end of the timer.
[119:02.93]Good for you.
[119:07.96]Hey, thanks a lot, Bernie.
[119:09.56]Appreciate it, man.
[119:13.78]Let's kill this guy.
[119:19.93]Oh, yes.
[119:21.19]I feel fucking fantastic right now.
[119:23.91]Oh my God.
[119:28.65]That's fine.
[119:30.68]Perfect ending.
[119:31.64]Perfect ending to a fucking incredible show.
[119:34.96]Oh my God.
[119:36.50]I'm annoying.
[119:39.14]I always feel like annoying.
[119:48.51]Am I normal speaking in my normal routine?
[119:55.07]Am I the annoying guy?
[119:56.21]I might be the annoying guy.
[120:02.58]Oh, wait.
[120:03.20]Yeah, we could go out.
[120:04.08]We could go out to eat with Jeremy, but man, he just... He's always moving and talking and making sounds.
[120:12.88]I'd rather hang out with your mother.
[120:14.85]I'd rather spend time with your in-laws than go to dinner with Jeremy.
[120:24.27]Yeah, he like picks up the handkerchiefs and goes like, and he puts a knife.
[120:30.17]He puts a butter knife in the napkin, hides it.
[120:32.97]So when he blows his nose, he tilts the knife up.
[120:36.03]So it looks like the air is going up really, really hard into the napkin.
[120:40.07]And he thinks it's funny every single time he does it, but I'm just like annoyed by it by this point.
[120:44.83]I don't want to see it anymore.
[120:47.97]But he keeps doing it.
[120:49.25]Every time we go out to eat, he picks up the napkin, picks up the knife, and he goes, oh, I've got a little bit of a cold.
[120:55.30]And no one laughs.
[120:56.78]He just does it every time.
[120:58.66]No one laughs.
[121:00.84]And then we just keep having a conversation.
[121:02.66]Has he figured it out yet that we don't think it's funny?
[121:04.77]It's like we don't laugh at it.
[121:09.89]Where's the other five?
[121:25.59]You are the one guy.
[121:29.35]Where did I lose these guys?
[121:30.38]Oh, they were here.
[121:35.00]Let's do a double or nothing.
[121:36.18]No, double or nothing doesn't... What do you mean double or nothing?
[121:38.52]What are you talking about?
[121:42.22]Why does it look so weird?
[121:46.08]You don't double or nothing with bets.
[121:49.35]I mean, well, you don't.
[121:52.15]This time do 20 minutes.
[121:55.39]How about this?
[121:57.99]Let's get the predictions out.
[121:59.03]I mean, look, you can predict on this if you want.
[122:01.87]But how about this?
[122:03.55]You guys willing to put up a billion dollars in the debt if I cannot do any dumb, funny voices for 20 minutes?
[122:16.32]No screaming and no funny voices for 20 minutes.
[122:20.26]Can I get that?
[122:20.72]Can we go for it?
[122:30.04]No, this is gonna be really boring.
[122:31.44]It's gonna be really boring if you do.
[122:39.57]Alright, well I'm gonna kill this guy.
[122:43.09]Come eat a white one.
[122:46.39]Eat.
[122:50.21]Eat!
[122:50.73]Come out and eat!
[122:57.31]I'm one idiot.
[122:57.97]I'm one idiot.
[123:00.58]That's me laughing.
[123:02.70]I wasn't able to do it for now.
[123:04.02]I don't know.
[123:04.76]I'm freaking out now.
[123:05.44]I'm like a soda can.
[123:10.54]I was like shook up a shitload.
[123:23.53]Only funny voices.
[123:24.89]Wait.
[123:26.85]only funny voices for 20 straight minutes I don't know if I can do that only funny voices for 20 minutes only oh god oh my god um do I get any time do I get any time between that sounds like hell that sounds like hell I get one five minute break
[124:00.66]Okay, I don't think I want to do this.
[124:02.84]Okay.
[124:03.24]Alright.
[124:03.90]And by the way, funny voices cost no breaks.
[124:06.18]Oh my God.
[124:07.88]So no breaks and no Bernie.
[124:10.56]I don't know.
[124:10.92]I was just going to say, what if I just do Bernie for 20 minutes?
[124:14.12]Does that count?
[124:18.41]No breaks and no Bernie.
[124:20.43]What?
[124:24.81]That's not fair at all.
[124:27.87]Bernie is fine.
[124:28.59]Bernie, please.
[124:29.09]Bernie counts.
[124:29.69]Okay.
[124:31.52]Alright.
[124:32.22]Are we doing this?
[124:32.70]We're doing this.
[124:34.06]We're doing this right now.
[124:35.48]New poll.
[124:37.08]20 minutes of only doing voices.
[124:39.38]I cannot speak in my normal voice for 20 straight minutes.
[124:42.10]Yes or no?
[124:42.56]For $1 billion off the debt.
[124:45.12]Tell me.
[124:45.98]This is the one.
[124:50.00]I just cannot speak in my normal speaking voice for 20 minutes.
[124:54.10]Okay?
[124:55.18]I want to get an official.
[125:02.56]For no normal speaking voice.
[125:10.34]This is actually gonna suck, I'll be honest with you.
[125:14.80]People that come into the stream that have not been here forever, or that may be new viewers or something, they're just gonna think I'm trying so fucking hard.
[125:23.72]Like, I am just trying so hard to be, like, funny and shit.
[125:30.89]Like, Jesus, man.
[125:31.85]Like, come on.
[125:33.19]Really?
[125:33.61]Like, you're just a doing of voices for 20 minutes.
[125:37.45]For, like, 10 minutes straight.
[125:39.69]Like, funny.
[125:40.99]I get it.
[125:41.25]Like, just relax, dude.
[125:42.15]Just play Pikmin.
[125:42.89]Like, nobody cares.
[125:43.69]We don't, like, people want to hang out and have fun.
[125:45.33]Like, you don't have to try this hard by, like, just doing, like, Bernie Sanders for, like, 20 minutes.
[125:50.92]I almost walked everybody into that.
[125:55.40]Uh, this is unanimous.
[125:56.22]Alright, we're doing it.
[125:57.30]20 minutes...
[125:59.04]If I do not do it, if I speak in my normal voice one time, then, oh God, what happens?
[126:05.95]Does that, we add a billion?
[126:14.97]It adds a billion.
[126:15.53]Okay.
[126:18.56]Alright.
[126:19.16]I'm going to have to take a break before this though.
[126:20.58]I'm going to have to take a break and go piss and get ready.
[126:32.30]You have to add another day of Catboy.
[126:33.92]No.
[126:34.12]Alright, yeah.
[126:38.16]Let me go take a quick break.
[126:39.92]When I come back, we will do a 3-2-1.
[126:42.60]And then I'm just not going to speak in my normal speaking voice for 20 minutes.
[126:47.99]Under any circumstance.
[126:50.45]All I'm just imagining... I'm imagining me getting like a call.
[126:54.98]Like a very important call that I have to take.
[127:02.84]Mr. Elbertson, there's been an accident.
[127:05.48]There's been an accident?
[127:06.50]Okay.
[127:07.02]Well, let me just make sure that everything's okay.
[127:09.38]No.
[127:11.88]I'm going to lose.
[127:17.28]Mr. Elbertson, yeah, it's us.
[127:19.20]You have not paid your electric bill.
[127:21.48]Not paid my electric bill?
[127:22.78]Well, would you look at that?
[127:23.76]Sorry about that.
[127:24.72]I'll work on that.
[127:25.90]I'll get better at that.
[127:26.88]I promise.
[127:30.70]Facecam?
[127:31.12]That's not part of the deal.
[127:31.84]These are not.
[127:35.04]Are you mocking me now, Mr. Elbertson?
[127:37.08]No, no, I promise.
[127:38.24]This is not me mocking you.
[127:39.82]It's not a mock.
[127:40.74]It's absolutely not a mock.
[127:42.06]I just have something going on here.
[127:43.84]Your mock stopped doing that voice.
[127:45.34]I'm not.
[127:45.76]I'm trying.
[127:46.32]That's not how I speak.
[127:53.25]Facecam.
[127:53.71]I'm not putting on a facecam.
[127:54.67]No, I'm not putting a facecam on.
[127:55.77]No.
[127:56.81]No facecam.
[127:57.33]You're not getting it.
[127:59.59]I got to go back.

[128:11.27]Cheating?
[128:11.63]What do you mean cheating?
[128:15.67]You hear me talk.
[128:16.87]You're listening to me speak.
[128:18.75]Where's the last one?
[128:23.54]What me having a facecam on is people just think I'm a fucking weirdo.
[128:28.96]It could be pre-recorded.
[128:30.28]No, it's not pre-recorded people.
[128:31.96]I'm just, I'm going to be sitting there.
[128:34.08]They're talking in voices like this to hold it with the fucking facecam on.
[128:37.54]This is going to be so embarrassing.
[128:44.96]If I hold on fine, fine.
[128:48.35]If the, if I turn that facecam on for 20 minutes and we do 20 minutes of voices and you have it on the whole time proof, I want another billion off the debt.
[128:54.49]If I do it another full billion.
[129:02.13]Is that, oh, we got a, you know, you have, you have anonymous that?
[129:04.92]Is it unanimous?

[129:28.07]2 billion off the debt.
[129:30.25]Sounds good to me.
[129:31.87]That's what it is.
[129:34.71]Zero treasure.

[130:06.71]I lied about it again.
[130:07.63]I don't know why.
[130:08.85]I don't want to make you think I'm drinking water.
[130:10.35]I am, but why would I lie about that?
[130:13.84]With facecam for $2 billion.
[130:21.90]Yeah, with facecam for $2 billion off.
[130:24.63]yes or no and again the facecam does not turn on if you say no to this it only turns on if it's two billion that's what I'm putting up I'm not going any lower alright here we go hi I'll be right back and I go take a quick pee

[142:34.31]It's too heavy.
[142:37.03]Okay, so I go this way.
[142:41.41]I wanted to go over this way with blue guys.
[142:52.51]I almost talked in my normal voice for a second.
[142:55.45]It was very close.
[142:56.47]I almost just talked in my normal speaking voice.
[143:00.41]So we need, um... How many of these do I need?

[143:28.43]Watch out for this guy.
[143:29.59]Watch out.
[143:30.11]He's getting ready to shoot you.
[143:34.71]Oh, this is actually pretty easy.
[143:37.43]I can do this for much longer than 20 minutes.
[143:40.70]You guys, I think you guys got scammed.
[143:42.34]Is it a raid?
[143:45.46]Oh, no.
[143:48.02]Is it actually a raid?
[143:50.64]I hope there's not a raid.
[143:52.72]I hope there's not a raid.
[144:00.00]Raid song?
[144:02.19]No, no, there can't be a raid song right now.
[144:04.77]I don't.
[144:05.27]I hope there's not a raid.
[144:06.27]Is there a raid?
[144:07.35]There's not a raid.
[144:08.39]I don't see a raid.
[144:11.10]I do not see a raid.
[144:14.18]Thankfully, I don't see one over there.
[144:16.76]Dooku?
[144:47.14]This is very funny, Mr. Doodle.
[144:59.05]Okay, we're fine.
[144:59.99]We're doing fine.
[145:00.77]It's gonna go this way.
[145:02.99]Watch out for this guy.
[145:04.39]Watch out for this guy.
[145:06.47]Kill this guy.
[145:08.64]It's so much more worse with the facecam on.
[145:11.92]I hate it on.
[145:23.22]I need some yellows over here to get those.
[145:27.68]I think that with yellow, that would be good.
[145:30.18]Actually, that could give me at least a few extra blue guys.
[145:37.41]Which I'll take.
[145:38.15]I'll take the blue guys.
[145:44.97]Come on, you little bastards.
[145:46.77]Pick it up.
[145:48.75]At least try to pick up this one.
[145:56.34]Okay.
[145:58.77]So how am I supposed to print?
[146:01.09]How do I take everybody?
[146:03.64]Should I throw everybody over there?
[146:05.18]Would that be better?
[146:05.70]I think that's a good idea.
[146:07.42]Let's throw them.
[146:09.46]Yeah, I think we go over here.
[146:27.58]That guy's got a cannon.
[146:30.04]Watch out for that guy.
[146:30.78]That guy's got a cannon.
[146:32.70]People are saying you can laugh normally.
[146:37.57]No, I cannot laugh normally.
[146:41.11]I can't.
[146:43.45]Laughing normally is going to get me in a lot of trouble.
[146:45.83]I cannot laugh normally.
[146:50.24]I'm sticking with this.
[146:51.44]And I'm going to try to stay as long as I can.
[146:54.08]As long as I possibly can do it.
[146:58.58]Now, they are going the way that they're not supposed to be going.
[147:02.75]They're supposed to go a different way.
[147:05.09]I'm a little concerned that these little guys are going to die.
[147:08.15]They almost did.
[147:10.17]It was very close.
[147:12.17]It was incredibly close.
[147:17.60]Somebody died.
[147:20.76]Does anybody know where the purples are?
[147:28.42]Where are the purples?
[147:31.41]I seem to have lost my purple guys.
[147:34.79]Oh, they're back here, I think.
[147:37.07]Actually getting harder to stay in one of these voices.
[147:41.58]They drowned?
[147:42.32]What are you talking about?
[147:43.24]They didn't drown.
[147:45.40]Get out of here.
[147:46.04]You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
[147:50.04]I think that they're still alive.
[147:59.51]We've got to overwhelm this guy.
[148:04.11]I'm going to try to overwhelm him as much as I can.
[148:08.12]It's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at the same time.
[148:13.06]I'll tell you, it's not easy.
[148:15.84]All of my concentration is completely just front loaded into the top of my head to only talk in a weird way.
[148:24.61]I don't, I have no idea.
[148:26.23]I got, I'm having trouble playing the game.
[148:31.63]It's already halfway through the day.
[148:39.56]So I can't get that treasure, but I can do... What else is left to do here?
[148:48.00]I can turn around and go the other way, which I can do that, I think.
[149:03.39]I think, these little guys.
[149:05.87]I'm gonna take them to get the egg.
[149:09.32]That's what I'm gonna do.
[149:11.30]They're going to get the egg.
[149:12.22]I love eggs.
[149:13.52]They're my favorite breakfast in the entire world.
[149:21.38]Everybody, drink up.
[149:23.72]We've got many, many... Nectars.
[149:28.24]French fries.
[149:31.68]Excuse me.
[149:33.76]Watch out.
[149:34.62]Do not go near them.
[149:35.66]Don't touch them.
[149:36.64]Don't even think about it.
[149:38.24]It's stupid.
[149:38.90]Don't touch them.
[149:41.61]We're going to try to land on their heads.
[149:45.07]Very carefully.
[149:46.75]Very carefully.
[149:47.49]Very strongly.
[149:54.55]Good.
[149:56.55]Good, good, good, good, good.
[149:58.01]Now pick them up and bring them back for a snack.
[150:00.73]Yes!
[150:03.08]I get to do... Ooh, and nobody can say -2.
[150:07.22]Nobody can say -2 right now.
[150:10.50]Who's ready for an adventure?
[150:13.04]I can do Sir Finley Morgleton as long as I want.
[150:15.94]I hate this fucking voice.
[150:17.98]This voice sucks.
[150:19.54]I hate it.
[150:21.18]I think it's stupid, but I get to do it for as long as I want.
[150:25.90]Who's ready for an adventure?
[150:35.01]okay so I think what I have to do is I have to cross over here for the blue guys how long is it how long has it been I might have to do this for 10 more minutes everybody
[151:14.93]Okay.
[151:20.79]Oh, watch out for this big bug.
[151:22.61]There's a big bug over here.
[151:27.95]And he buried into the ground.
[151:29.17]Okay, that seems pretty easy.
[151:31.50]We just need everybody to go over there and just whack it with their heads.
[151:36.20]Oh, they just got absolutely whacked.
[151:38.96]This is really stupid and fucking hard to do.
[151:41.76]I don't even know where to go.
[151:51.01]People are being tasked.
[151:55.19]How am I supposed to kill everybody over there?
[151:58.13]I did slip a little bit.
[151:59.49]It was really close, but I pulled it back very close.
[152:02.11]I fucking hate this.
[152:03.09]This is the worst thing I've ever done on stream.
[152:07.38]This is the worst thing I've ever done.
[152:20.42]Well.
[152:22.53]I do believe that we can very simply pull over this guy Bart.
[152:29.01]Take him over here and jump on his head.
[152:36.07]And then eventually we'll cross this river.
[152:47.46]I've wasted two full days, Brian.
[152:49.70]I've wasted two full days on this.
[152:52.44]Ryan, I... No, it would be great if I didn't waste two full days, Ryan.
[153:04.15]Good job, guys.
[153:04.81]You got out of the water.
[153:07.28]I'm stuck.
[153:07.90]I'm stuck.
[153:10.34]I'm stuck.
[153:11.46]I don't know what to do.
[153:13.40]I don't understand.
[153:14.42]I don't know.
[153:18.60]It's very hard to do this.
[153:20.13]It's incredibly difficult to do this.
[153:33.39]That guy over there has got to die.
[153:35.39]Free voice, Andy.
[153:38.36]Free voice, Andy.
[153:39.14]I don't care.
[153:42.20]I need purples.
[153:43.22]I don't have any purples.
[153:55.45]This is me.
[153:56.59]I have no voice.
[153:58.61]I'm a bird.
[154:09.21]I am a goblin.
[154:11.55]Why won't everybody jump over this wall?
[154:14.95]Attack this guy, please!
[154:16.43]Kill him!
[154:16.73]Kill that guy.
[154:17.21]He's an idiot.
[154:38.58]Okay, quick!
[154:39.51]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that, please!
[154:42.47]I want everyone to know that we, me, Otto... Show this guy, please, thank you.
[155:00.51]I don't know where they are, I don't know where the rest of them are!
[155:08.50]96 of them are gonna die!
[155:23.61]I only have to do this for five and a half more minutes.
[155:28.49]Say something funny I don't care how funny this shit is I don't care This could be some of the most ridiculously unfunny stuff you've ever heard In your entire life I don't care
[155:42.38]I just am trying to keep my normal speaking voice from coming out at all.
[155:47.59]I don't give a shit about how funny this sounds.
[155:51.25]I don't care about what I look like on stream.
[155:53.79]I don't give a shit.
[155:55.47]I don't care.
[155:56.81]And I thought that I almost slipped.
[155:59.23]But what happened was I vented to a Jerma guy.
[156:12.60]Louie, we suddenly stopped hearing from you.
[156:15.19]Is everything okay?
[156:16.97]If things get tough, you can always come home.
[156:20.19]I'll suck up all those pit-pit carrots that you love.
[156:34.32]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[156:42.13]a noise noise noise is my favorite noise my favorite weird voice this is bernie this is bernie if bernie is morphing into a bunch of things bernie is morphing into Jerma guy again bernie is morphing into guy that speaks like this I'm getting close to losing I am that was not a slip that was not a slip that was me changing to this guy that was not a slip
[157:12.01]absolutely no sleep somebody just wrote god dot dot dot dot they must I must have I must this must be so annoying I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I really am so sorry
[157:36.56]But I need to take this debt down.
[157:38.53]I need to get the debt to come down very, very quickly, as fast as I can.
[157:44.15]I'm so sorry.
[157:44.81]He's getting desperate.
[157:57.34]Yeah.
[157:58.50]Yeah, this is what desperation looks like.
[158:01.43]Because every time I try to do this and try to shave off the debt, it never works.
[158:05.35]And I always just look like a fucking asshole.
[158:09.89]Every single time, I just look like a fucking idiot.
[158:13.19]It makes me look really stupid.
[158:22.38]I want to go to that place that has... Only...
[158:31.61]Blue Pikmin in there.
[158:40.34]Not Blue Pikmin in there.
[158:43.40]I'm heading over that way to the Blue Pikmin Center.
[158:50.52]Wait, I have 86 of them.
[158:54.78]Now how high do I have to go up north?
[159:01.98]The amulet.
[159:04.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[159:06.09]No, no, no, no.
[159:13.31]North, north.
[159:13.93]Which way is north?
[159:15.25]I don't know which way north is.
[159:16.61]Two minutes and I can finally turn this shit off.
[159:19.79]I can turn this stupid fucking thing off and just be done with this.
[159:23.52]Just go up?
[159:24.98]Okay, should I take any purpose or something with me?
[159:29.20]I would take
[159:31.20]No, do I need any purples?
[159:36.10]No.
[159:37.78]Or it only has to be blue.
[159:39.78]Okay, well let's just take some blue stuff.
[159:43.39]Only blue Pikmins, okay.
[159:46.57]So let me get to 100 blue Pikmins.
[159:51.81]Okay.
[159:53.73]1 minute and 20 seconds.
[160:03.48]From temperature, I cure and eat clowns.
[160:20.06]Now, let me think.
[160:22.78]And I wasn't going to be able to do this.
[160:25.58]Let me be perfectly clear.
[160:28.55]I could.
[160:35.98]What are you talking about?
[160:39.00]Not a slip.
[160:39.87]This is not a slip.
[160:41.95]This is Barack Obama.
[160:45.15]That's not a slip.
[160:47.02]That sounds sort of like the way that I kind of talk a little.
[160:51.02]But now you make me go...
[161:09.03]I'm gonna be in debt forever.
[161:33.57]Let me explain what happened.
[161:35.25]I started to do Barack Obama.
[161:39.23]Started doing, uh, Barack Obama.
[161:41.67]Everyone said slipped.
[161:42.63]Slip, slip, slip, slip, slip, slip.
[161:44.57]And then I started to make Barack Obama's voice sound fucking horrible.
[161:48.93]So I didn't want to make it sound like I was doing a really shitty Barack Obama, so I was correct.
[161:52.52]I was telling you guys that, oh, look at how bad my Barack Obama sounds now.
[162:02.90]No slip?
[162:06.41]What do you mean?
[162:06.85]I won?
[162:07.15]I did it?
[162:10.79]Did I actually do it?
[162:24.04]Watch the clip and pull it.
[162:26.26]Alright, let's watch the clip.
[162:27.64]I'm... Clip and pull.
[162:36.90]Okay.
[162:43.04]I think a lot of you guys just fucking feel bad.
[162:44.92]Let me hear it.
[162:52.95]I want to hear it.
[162:53.65]Where is it?
[162:54.63]Let me see it.
[163:03.39]Obama slips.
[163:04.13]Let's see.
[163:04.47]Turn it up.
[163:08.65]I could.
[163:09.77]And I did.
[163:10.41]Let me be perfectly clear.
[163:13.36]I could.
[163:14.50]And I did.
[163:16.40]I did it well.
[163:20.79]What are you talking about?
[163:23.83]Not a slip.
[163:24.69]This is non-slip.
[163:26.77]This is Barack Obama.
[163:29.97]That's not a slip.
[163:31.83]That sounds sort of like the way that I kind of talk a little.
[163:35.84]But now you make me go... That was Bernie Sanders into Mario getting his ass lit on fire.
[163:44.63]I kind of talk a little, but now I, now... Now, now, now, now I... Yeah, that was Bernie Sanders then turning into Mario, getting his ass lit on fire.
[163:55.73]You make me go, ah!
[163:56.96]Now you make me go, ah!
[163:58.04]But now, now you make me go, ah!
[163:59.98]But now, now, now, now you make, now you make me go, ah!
[164:02.84]Now you make me go, ah!
[164:04.84]That's not a slip, that's Bernie Sanders.
[164:06.64]Go, ah!
[164:09.70]I think we're good.
[164:10.66]Talk a little, but now, now you make me go, ah!
[164:18.32]So in question, was that a slip?
[164:22.60]This is the fucking stupidest thing I've ever done.
[164:37.35]Let me give it to you again.
[164:38.25]So you know what you're doing here.
[164:40.15]Now you make me go...
[164:50.56]Was that a slip?
[164:51.00]Or was that Bernie Sanders just seamlessly going into a loud, funny, like, Ren and Stimpy scream?
[165:10.34]It was seamless.
[165:11.04]It was seamless Bernie Sanders.
[165:12.58]Now you're making me go...
[165:19.75]Loud equals funny.
[165:21.29]Exactly.
[165:22.89]Absolutely.
[165:23.29]You're right.
[165:23.93]Absolutely.
[165:24.47]Loud equals funny.
[165:25.29]1 billion.
[165:39.81]1.5 billion compromise.
[165:53.53]This is a no-slip, by the way.
[165:55.19]Alright, that's a 1.5 billion compromise.
[166:00.11]We'll take 500 million off the debt for me.
[166:02.71]Maybe an awkward transition between Bernie going into Mario, lighting his ass on fire?
[166:10.19]Alright, deal.
[166:15.61]Deal.
[166:16.09]Deal.
[166:16.41]Alright, let's go.
[166:16.99]I'm gonna play the game now.
[166:18.42]I'm getting on fucking facecam.
[166:26.12]That was so painful.
[166:27.82]That sucked.
[166:28.96]That was the worst.
[166:33.40]That's... Yeah, is it worth, like, the potentially... Okay, yeah, I get that compromise.
[166:45.61]Is it worth... You'd shave 500 million off that 1.5 billion compromise.
[166:49.85]That's fine.
[166:50.73]You know how many people left the stream because they couldn't take it anymore and they probably won't come back?
[166:59.21]I just lost out on people.
[167:03.55]Gained viewers.
[167:04.49]Yeah, but how many did we lose?
[167:15.76]Gained viewers.
[167:19.02]Alright, let me get a... Where are we at?
[167:23.10]Bang, go this way.
[167:25.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:29.84]Now you're going to lose viewers.
[167:32.50]Yeah, that's probably.
[167:33.28]Oh, well.
[167:37.30]Okay, 83.
[167:38.32]How many do I have now?
[167:41.70]Double or nothing?
[167:42.36]Absolutely not.
[167:47.71]I absolutely not going to double or nothing.
[167:50.43]I'm taking that as I can get it.
[167:52.09]98 out of 100.
[167:53.31]Damn it.
[167:56.22]Give me two more.
[167:56.70]And then I'm going in that one that's all, they need all blue.
[168:02.31]Uh, this was fun though.
[168:03.01]Pikmin's, this, I had a lot more fun with this than I thought it was gonna.
[168:05.03]I know you heard me complain about, um, how desperately I hated the Wii, the Wii motion controller.
[168:10.99]And what I saw, I call this like a, what, a $40 system or something.
[168:14.66]And what I call the Wii U, I made fun of the Wii U a bunch.
[168:17.60]I was really mean to the Wii U. Really mean.
[168:22.39]I said it was like a $40 console and like how dare they sell this for more than $40, right?
[168:25.55]Well, whatever.
[168:27.03]Alright, pick it up.
[168:51.79]The $2 billion was added.
[168:54.29]We had a vote.
[168:56.25]They added the debt.
[168:57.27]No, we had a vote.
[168:58.59]We had a vote that it wasn't a slip, that it was a $1.5 billion.
[169:01.49]It was a $500 million compromise.
[169:16.78]They fixed it.
[169:17.32]Okay, good.
[169:29.78]okay here we go I got 100 blue Pikmin so where is it it's up here citadel spiders glutton's kitchen or shower room so it's glutton's kitchen that's where we have to go no

[170:09.39]Where is he?
[170:09.71]Come on, my Wiimote tracker is fucked up.
[170:18.43]Okay, 100.

[170:27.87]Oh shit, you're right, yeah.

[174:02.60]Is there a way I can separate them?
[174:06.76]How do I... I only want the guys with the flowers.
[174:22.06]Put all away, then take them only to... Okay.
[174:34.14]Well, I'm out of time anyways.

[175:32.95]Mr. Jerma, you didn't get my message, but I'm glad I caught your stream today.
[175:37.15]I've been watching you since your TF2 days years ago.
[175:39.59]You've been a source of laughter and entertainment for a long time.
[175:41.13]This week, I'm going into quarantine for two weeks and I'm joining the USMC.
[175:44.70]I'm a little too old for it.
[175:46.46]A little old for it.
[175:47.48]26 years old.
[175:47.88]But it's my dream.
[175:48.96]You've been an inspiration in a weird way to have some bits and buy yourself plenty of Mountain Dew.
[175:55.84]As the elite gamer that you are.
[176:00.24]Well, thank you.
[176:01.62]Good luck.
[176:08.70]Thanks for sticking around.
[176:12.62]You say I'm a little old for it.
[176:13.72]You're never too old for anything.
[176:19.17]Thanks for watching.
[176:20.35]I wish you the absolute best of luck.
[176:29.02]Who died?

[177:07.44]Where's the best one?
[177:13.44]Where's the best place to get a purple flower?

[182:00.06]Alright, now we go through here.
[182:01.70]Just run.
[182:02.84]Just hang the edge.
[182:04.58]Hang on the edge.
[182:05.00]Don't even get attacked.
[182:05.86]Run.
[182:08.07]Run.
[182:09.15]Run.
[182:09.63]Run.
[182:10.11]Run.
[182:10.63]Run.
[182:11.27]Run.
[182:12.61]Run.
[182:14.25]You are too slow.
[182:15.31]It's so annoying.
[182:16.27]Okay, now where?
[182:19.43]I see something over there.
[182:20.21]Is that it?
[182:21.71]It's over here.
[182:24.29]I'm ready.
[182:24.59]Here we go.
[182:35.99]Don't call them annoying.
[182:37.03]Deeper sections of this hole seem to be submerged in liquid.
[182:40.99]Sadly, I am a delicate piece of machinery that is sensitive to water.
[182:44.31]You two must go alone.
[182:45.14]There might be treasure chests down there.
[182:49.48]Why do you look at me with such scornful of... Whatever.
[182:56.92]Captain Crunch cereal voice.
[182:59.00]Captain Crunch cereal voice.
[183:04.10]Fuck, I did the drunk guy thing again.
[183:05.58]Alright, what is this?
[183:06.26]Why are they breaking over here?
[183:15.24]Ooh, there's that too.
[183:16.38]Hold on.
[183:18.61]What are these guys hitting?
[183:22.35]Why do they do that?
[183:29.25]Oh, well, whatever.
[183:32.13]13 treasures?
[183:33.81]That seems like a lot.
[183:34.57]Okay.
[183:48.58]Blue Pikmin.
[183:49.57]Do I need red Pikmin?
[183:56.47]There's fire everywhere.
[183:57.31]How am I supposed to do this with blue Pikmin?
[184:14.55]I get it.
[184:14.89]Just run him into the water.
[184:16.01]Grab this.
[184:31.62]Go!
[184:31.78]Get it!
[184:32.74]Oh, they ate it.
[184:59.93]Wait, kill it while it's... Kill it while it's not on fire.
[185:09.05]Good job.
[185:11.74]Come here.
[185:11.94]Go in the water.
[185:13.16]We're good.
[185:13.44]Alright.
[185:13.66]Nice.
[185:13.88]Nice.
[185:14.12]Nice.
[185:14.30]Nice.
[185:14.56]I got whatever this is.
[185:15.38]I got a skateboard wheel.
[185:18.64]Emote only, please.
[185:19.46]Why?
[185:21.14]Emote only?
[185:21.86]For what?
[185:30.06]Pastry wheel.
[185:30.94]Oh, that's cute.
[185:31.32]Alright, let's keep going.
[185:37.43]Okay.
[185:42.59]Still treasures on this level.
[185:44.79]Check this out.
[185:45.31]We're going to overwhelm it while it's not on fire.
[185:47.55]Kill it.
[185:47.85]Come on.
[185:48.21]Come on.
[185:48.45]Come on.
[185:48.89]Good.
[185:50.47]Very good.
[185:51.09]Very good.
[185:52.36]Very good.
[185:54.84]You idiots.
[185:56.74]You're making me very upset at you.
[186:00.52]Wait, punch it.
[186:01.58]Why are they not doing it?
[186:03.99]Punch this.
[186:13.41]I demand it.
[186:14.31]I don't know why they were taking so long.
[186:18.87]Okay.
[186:21.61]That's a safe trip through here.
[186:23.11]Through here.
[186:29.38]Um, where's this other treasure?
[186:37.24]Oh, shit.
[186:37.82]Okay, it's over there.
[186:41.50]That's a huge guy, though.
[186:42.48]I don't know if this is worth it.
[186:56.85]Maybe I'm... Oh, fuck.
[187:02.19]I don't know if it's worth doing this.
[187:03.71]He's asleep though.
[187:04.50]Oh, that's not worth it.
[187:05.82]I don't care.
[187:07.40]No, definitely not worth it.
[187:08.50]No way.
[187:08.76]I'm just getting the hell out of here.
[187:21.79]You're a coward.
[187:23.07]That's alright, whatever.
[187:27.27]You know for a fact that at least 10 to 20 Pikmin were going to die right there if I wasn't doing that and under that control.
[187:34.42]Weemote only.
[187:35.30]That's pretty good.
[187:41.51]Ooh, yes!
[187:49.21]Give me friends!
[187:51.75]Ah, that's a lot of new friends.
[187:54.00]That's a very large amount of new friends.
[187:55.98]And he had a cookie.
[188:00.42]Wait.
[188:00.92]Easy.
[188:05.85]Give that shit back right now.
[188:12.85]Don't let him burn you.
[188:13.55]Don't let him burn you.
[188:14.19]Don't let him burn you.
[188:14.85]Run away!
[188:15.03]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[188:26.43]Don't let him lay you.
[188:29.18]Alright, let's get everybody.
[188:30.36]Pick them all up.
[188:31.74]I love the little bulbies.
[188:32.80]It's so cool.
[188:36.82]I'm glad I got them.
[188:42.30]Who stole the cookies?
[188:48.03]I mean, I just got to do Otto's Pogtastic Adventure and that's pretty much going to be gone.
[188:59.00]Comfort cookie.
[188:59.80]Cool.
[189:04.46]Oops.
[189:04.89]No, no, no, no.
[189:18.87]Break this down.
[189:21.75]Do the Captain Crunch voice again.
[189:22.95]No.
[189:23.29]For what?
[189:33.19]You got a no interest loan here.
[189:43.58]There's so much cuter to they instead of going her they go hurry.
[189:49.26]I love the little bulbies.
[189:53.20]Now the question is, where's the other treasure?
[189:56.04]Here.
[189:59.02]Dangerous hole.
[190:01.49]Dangerous hole.
[190:04.09]oh but but hold on everybody relax I don't want to do this yet until there's probably a sleeping guy is there nothing here something's not going to jump out and attack I know there is right yeah of course you're right here
[190:35.62]These guys don't jump down.
[190:39.07]It's alright.
[190:46.14]I think, can I.
[191:10.65]Get it!
[191:15.61]Fuck.
[191:16.45]Oh well.

[191:43.72]I lost a few, but it's okay.
[191:58.19]Okay.
[191:58.89]Hey, in the words of Albert Einstein, one, two, skip a few, 99, 100.
[192:03.17]You know what I'm saying?
[192:04.71]Okay.
[192:16.70]Do I have everybody?
[192:27.92]I think it's alright.
[192:29.69]I don't see anything.
[192:31.99]No monster has attacked yet, which is kind of scary.
[192:35.15]Something over there.
[192:35.71]The guy with the balloons.
[192:53.57]It's the thing from Monster Ranger.
[192:58.84]What is this?
[192:59.54]I can see it with my optical receptors, but my sensors cannot detect this steamroller.
[193:08.58]Could its physical form be anchored in another dimension?
[193:10.94]Attacking it is futile.
[193:13.90]If only we could force it to take on physical form, but in its current state, no.
[193:20.17]Danger, danger, danger.
[193:21.29]It's a steamroller.
[193:23.01]Alright, well, he's all the way in the water.
[193:28.09]Um, put this up first.
[193:32.45]Is this cheese or tape?
[193:37.63]Oh, infection hoop.
[193:40.79]Oh my God, he's coming up here.
[193:46.85]He's fast too.
[193:47.67]Come on, come on, come on.
[194:05.02]Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

[194:25.57]Oh, no.
[194:26.35]Oh, no.
[194:27.56]Oh, no.
[194:27.88]He's not down here yet.
[194:36.94]Wait, we can hide in here.
[194:37.64]He can't get in here.
[194:38.10]Come on, everybody in.
[194:40.90]Everybody in, everybody in, everybody in.

[194:55.55]Okay.
[195:08.39]Do not push them out.
[195:09.19]Don't come back here.
[195:12.57]Don't crush them.
[195:15.89]There's too many people.
[195:25.35]Okay, you can't.
[195:31.57]I'm going.
[195:31.89]I'm ready.
[195:32.17]I'm ready.
[195:32.43]I'm ready.
[195:32.71]Let's go this way.
[195:36.06]We slide down here.
[195:38.21]Now we have access.
[195:39.21]We can run this way.
[195:40.11]We just have to use the tunnels.
[196:08.68]Do I have to break this?
[196:13.64]What the fuck?
[196:15.04]Can I?
[196:19.46]That's a bomb!
[196:26.15]I'm fine.
[196:29.11]Everybody get out of the way!
[196:36.65]Oh!

[197:39.72]Where is he?
[197:41.20]Okay, look, this guy, I gotta kill this thing.
[197:43.00]This is gonna ruin everything.
[197:54.43]Now have him blow up by his own balloon.
[197:57.77]No.
[198:06.14]Dead.
[198:06.44]Okay, good.
[198:08.34]Where is he?
[198:11.61]Can he fit through here?
[198:23.50]Why is he not coming down here?
[198:45.83]I lost him.
[198:46.83]He's good.
[198:47.29]I'm good.
[198:51.73]Just get that donut in there.

[200:42.19]Listen.
[200:42.35]Listen.
[200:45.25]That's so much cuter of a song than the Pikmin one.
[200:55.86]That's so much cooler.
[200:56.94]Electricity.
[200:57.74]I want them to drink.
[200:58.84]Someone must.
[201:17.05]I want the bulbs to drink.
[201:18.99]Oh Jesus.

[202:37.64]I just want the bulbs to drink.
[202:38.72]Come on over here.
[202:44.94]Yes!
[202:46.38]Oh, yes!
[202:50.76]There's an egg over there.
[203:01.87]This is dangerous.
[203:06.66]Thank you.
[203:12.49]Holy shi- I didn't know that's what they did.
[203:23.02]I didn't know.
[203:28.92]That was when the Machina first came out.
[203:31.28]People went on their private servers with like 15 of their friends and just, man, can we line everybody up and just shoot through everyone?
[203:39.18]yes it can oh my god this is a disaster well it is a bulby run now because I can't get anything else
[204:01.26]reset actually no I've no I can't I can do it with bulbies trust me look at holy we're getting more bulbies aren't bulbies stronger I just need like another 20 30 of them
[204:38.08]They're immune.
[204:39.92]Yeah, they're fine.
[204:42.21]Bulbies can handle like electricities too.
[204:45.71]You reset when you have 10 die to a frog, but not when you massacre a hundred.
[204:50.49]Well, I mean, I didn't know what the steamroller guy was.
[205:05.88]This game is really cool.
[205:06.72]I like it.
[205:08.24]I highly recommend it.
[205:13.92]You had 80 Pikmin 15 minutes ago.
[205:17.20]Sure.
[205:26.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[205:31.83]Where did he come from?
[205:37.10]You just velo... Now actually reset.
[205:43.26]That's a... Well, I'll try that again.
[206:17.20]Why is he there?
[206:18.58]That's stupid.
[206:20.44]He shouldn't be there.
[206:30.32]You can press the home button and reset.
[206:31.70]Yeah, but it feels more like angry.
[206:46.29]It feels more angry if I, um, you know, if I do it and hit mash the button on the console because I'm mad.
[207:00.41]He's emulating.
[207:01.01]He's angry.
[207:09.08]And he said, Hey Jerma, I showed that clip to my little bro.
[207:11.86]He started giggling like crazy.
[207:13.12]He just can't believe someone would make such a simple mistake.
[207:16.24]I asked him what he thought and he suggested you play an easier game like Yahtzee.
[207:26.19]Your little brother's an asshole.
[207:35.86]What?
[207:36.04]What?
[207:38.27]Why am I seeing D face?
[207:41.21]He didn't say, hey, my little bro, who is also six.
[207:45.04]His little bro could be like 30.
[207:49.06]Just because somebody's somebody's little brother doesn't mean they're like five.
[207:54.18]That guy could be like 40 years old.
[207:55.87]Alright, let's go.
[208:08.00]Funny Fireman.
[208:15.80]So, I gotta move faster than this.
[208:17.92]This is... Is this the hardest level in the game?
[208:22.34]I guarantee it is.
[208:25.50]I don't really want white.
[208:28.36]This is Wii mode.
[208:29.66]I don't know what it is.
[208:30.36]Why are you freaking out?
[208:31.16]What are you doing?
[208:31.74]Stop.
[208:31.94]Not that.
[208:33.42]Stop.
[208:37.74]Okay, am I emanating a 2.4 gigahertz signal out of my teeth or something?
[208:43.04]I just reset the console and I can't pick it up anymore.
[208:49.43]I don't get it.
[208:52.55]It's way worse now.
[208:53.61]I didn't do anything.
[208:54.11]I didn't change anything.
[208:57.05]It's like just moving around like crazy.
[209:01.72]Sensor?
[209:02.26]Yeah, I recalibrate it every time I turn the fucking computer on.
[209:15.91]These guys remind me of Otto.
[209:36.38]The Wiimote you have seems really funky.
[209:40.14]Yeah, I mean, this is an official Nintendo Wiimote.
[209:53.29]storm get him swarm them swarm Pikmin use swarm Pikmin use tail swipe Pikmin Pikmin Pikmin Pikmin Pikmin Pikmin why do you guys watch that show
[210:28.98]Stop going over to the electricity!
[210:34.16]I said-
[210:45.55]I agree.
[210:46.57]I'm just fucking around.
[210:48.94]Didn't I say that I was going to stop pretending to like hate stuff?
[210:54.04]I think I made that statement.
[210:55.56]I was like, you know, I'm going to stop like pretending that I think things are stupid.
[210:58.34]That I hate things because people that might be new here.
[211:01.33]Yeah, I did mention that, didn't I?
[211:03.03]Like two or three days ago.
[211:18.45]I need more of those bulb guys.
[211:19.63]Aren't there a couple down here?
[211:22.17]Wemo, please.
[211:31.75]When the pretender is strange.
[211:33.19]I can't believe you guys have given me such a bad name with that meme, by the way.
[211:42.75]You guys know how many people hate this community because of that meme?
[211:48.57]Yeah, it's that, like, that's that Jerma guy.
[211:50.17]Yeah, he's a fucking loser.
[211:51.59]He's an asshole.
[211:55.77]Who's that?
[211:56.17]Who's that sus guy?
[211:57.33]Oh, yeah.
[211:57.87]Fuck that guy.
[211:58.63]Oh, my God.
[211:59.27]I almost lost.
[211:59.87]Oh, please.
[212:16.57]God, Pikmin is too hard.
[212:19.07]He just ate somebody.
[212:25.27]I'm gonna rage quit again.
[212:28.32]I'm rage quitting again.
[212:29.92]He's just fucking snacking.
[212:31.46]Just kill him.
[212:32.66]Oh my God.
[212:50.36]I hate those things.
[212:51.82]How the fuck are you supposed to kill those things reliably?
[212:54.64]He shakes them off and then he goes in the air and crushes them.
[213:01.68]I have less people than I...
[213:22.08]Wait, you lose the treasure?
[213:23.16]Wait, no, no, no, no, reset, reset, reset, reset, reset.
[213:25.68]I forgot.
[213:26.50]I thought... I would have just walked in the thing.
[213:29.97]I would have walked in the thing that shoots you up.
[213:31.79]I thought if you used it to escape that it meant... Okay.
[213:35.03]I know.
[213:35.25]It said that, didn't it?
[213:36.65]Okay.
[213:36.87]Well, hold on.
[213:37.95]Let me reset it.
[213:41.21]Is it too late to reset?
[213:41.87]Are you kidding me?
[213:43.91]Oh, god damn it.
[213:44.85]No, it's not.
[213:45.33]Don't save.
[213:48.10]Shit.
[213:48.26]Shit.
[213:50.68]Time to play Yahtzee.
[213:52.16]No.
[213:53.94]Whatever.
[213:54.56]It was a cool place.
[213:55.34]And I know that's the hardest level in the game.
[213:56.80]I know it's end game.
[213:58.24]Hard level.
[213:59.96]One of the hardest I've heard.
[214:00.88]Is that what he said?
[214:03.00]It was like, hey dude, that's a really hard level.
[214:06.60]And I don't worry about it.
[214:14.42]Jesus.
[214:14.66]Jesus.
[214:21.77]I do want to make sure I reiterate this again because there's 10k people here.
[214:25.28]Well, there was until I just failed that level miserably and 500 people left because that was an embarrassment and they couldn't stand it.
[214:32.16]But, you know, whatever.
[214:32.74]It's still this close to 10k.
[214:36.40]March 6th.
[214:37.04]This is going to be a pretty big stream.
[214:40.56]I'm going to be doing an archaeology adventure.
[214:47.70]I'm very excited about it.
[214:54.82]At 1 p.m.
[214:55.84]Pacific is the start time on March 6th.
[215:01.74]Bring your, you know, bring your shovels.
[215:04.55]Bring your eye.
[215:05.57]I'll be searching for all kinds of wonderful things.
[215:11.27]Alright, where have I not gone in here?
[215:20.08]I want to go to that glutton cave.
[215:23.52]Glutton's Kitchen.
[215:24.38]Yeah, I don't want to go to the submerged castle.
[215:26.26]That one's too hard.
[215:27.10]Did we already do Glutton's Kitchen?
[215:28.50]No, we did.
[215:29.14]I loved that place.
[215:31.90]Is there nothing else here that's worth doing?
[215:33.24]There's definitely treasure somewhere.
[215:34.32]Hold on.
[215:36.80]I'm just going to get a treasure on the map.
[215:39.70]I cleared it, right?
[215:45.01]There we go.
[215:45.87]Alright, there's a bottle opener right there.
[215:47.21]Cool.
[215:47.81]I want that.
[215:48.25]That guy's got fire run.
[216:06.06]Everyone's good.
[216:12.00]Uh, we'll do some collection.
[216:14.74]I don't want red to get those.
[216:15.65]I want blue to get them because we just, but first of all, this guy's going to, he's going to mess everything up.
[216:19.89]Yeah.
[216:32.64]There you go.
[216:32.94]What are you doing?
[216:37.02]What the hell are you guys doing?
[216:38.26]Oh my god, this Wiimote is going to make me scream into the microphone as loud as I can.
[216:52.61]I want yellow or blue to get these.
[217:05.66]And then yellow, you get the bottle opener.
[217:08.18]Are these the purple ones?
[217:20.17]Pretty cool if they were.
[217:20.85]Just saying.
[217:24.29]Can I reach it from here?
[217:25.03]I cannot.
[217:29.73]Where can I reach this from?
[217:30.89]Up there?
[217:49.24]I swear to God, my farts must be fucking 5G.
[217:52.62]I swear, I have no idea why this is doing this.
[217:56.32]And I have farted a lot the last couple of hours.
[218:04.14]I don't know why this signal is so fucked up right now.
[218:06.55]I didn't do anything.
[218:07.07]I didn't change anything.
[218:07.77]Give me that bottle opener.
[218:22.38]these are brand new batteries and I recalibrated the controller like two hours ago I must have I seriously must have like 2.4 gigahertz breath I wasn't on the treasure it's in the open
[218:52.15]Get the Wii Motion Plus.
[218:54.77]I think this is.
[218:55.47]Yeah, this is Wii Motion Plus inside.
[218:57.27]Yeah.
[218:59.31]I got it.
[219:00.99]Of course, you don't think I'm going to spring for the Wii Motion Plus controller?
[219:10.89]More, more, more.
[219:11.35]No, because only 12 games use it.
[219:20.78]Wasn't that standard in controllers after a certain year?
[219:24.08]After, like, the console was out for a little while?
[219:29.40]Go to that drained lake.
[219:32.18]Yeah, hold on.
[219:32.86]Let me see.
[219:35.52]What else is in here?
[219:36.24]There's another treasure on the map somewhere.
[219:45.23]Well, Jerma, we've been trying to reach you, but your car's extended warranty.
[219:47.59]Well, leave me alone.
[219:48.21]I don't want one.
[219:51.24]Over here?
[219:51.62]Any treasures over here?
[219:59.17]Ah, it's... Hold on.
[220:03.73]One of these assholes is over here, though.
[220:05.46]Hold on.
[220:08.46]I need purple.
[220:23.85]Run.
[220:24.86]Run!
[220:25.12]Alright, jump.
[220:28.48]I remember I drive a dirt bike.
[220:34.38]I drive a lawnmower.
[220:40.26]Jump at us.
[220:42.18]Why can't... I almost just blew that so bad.
[220:52.44]Who has a dirt bike?
[220:56.73]No, I don't have a dirt bike.
[220:58.49]I'm scared to drive a dirt bike.
[221:04.41]Dig?
[221:06.37]Something to dig?
[221:08.86]Something to dig, something to dig, something to dig!
[221:11.08]Do I have any white Pikmin?
[221:16.98]Here we go, yes!
[221:33.80]Jump.
[221:35.26]Don't kill that guy.
[221:39.73]Alright, now back up.
[221:50.48]Dead.
[221:55.06]Hurry up, get it.
[221:59.80]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[222:04.38]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[222:06.50]What is that?
[222:08.34]Oh, it's like a conch shell.
[222:17.28]We're good.
[222:17.60]We're good.
[222:18.78]We got enough people on it, right?
[222:20.01]Yeah.
[222:21.65]It's just right here.
[222:22.17]They got it.
[222:22.45]Okay.
[222:35.92]It's going to be close.
[222:39.48]You took that real wide turn.
[222:42.34]Real wide corner there.
[222:45.06]You didn't have to take it that wide.
[222:46.60]Three.
[222:52.37]Get it in.
[222:54.17]Get it in one.
[222:55.03]Well, I know where to go.
[223:12.52]game's addicting by the way I just want to make it really clear I'm not I don't hate Pokémon Pokémon's cool it's an interesting concept I think the show was interesting I like I thought it was interesting that was cool it was a cool show it was worth watching I would say
[223:42.55]Just want to make sure I go back to that because people were probably upset about that.
[223:45.99]I didn't mean that.
[223:46.61]I really didn't.
[223:47.13]I do that sometimes.
[223:48.21]That's what we do.
[223:49.91]We make up fake scenarios.
[223:55.76]Oh, yeah.
[223:57.42]Oh, yeah.
[223:58.44]My allowance doubled.
[224:00.78]And it's all thanks to my papa.
[224:02.34]After all, he's a great captain.
[224:06.48]He's a great captain.
[224:08.32]But when in the world will he be able to come home?
[224:15.38]Damn.
[224:15.54]Alright, I want that thing.
[224:30.09]Go out there, bury it up.
[224:31.41]It's probably worth 100, 200 bucks.
[224:32.65]It's worth it.
[224:32.99]So I'm just going to go dig it.
[224:42.74]I need some white.
[224:44.41]I only have six white Pikmin.
[224:45.53]That's horrible.
[224:51.48]Pikmin's cooler than Jerma.
[224:53.98]I mean, there's some facets of Pikmin that are cooler than me.
[224:59.18]I still think my coolness factor is a little bit higher than Pikmin by just a small amount.
[225:10.98]I think so.
[225:17.39]Uh, more red.
[225:24.81]Coolness factor.
[225:25.59]Alright, not wasting time.
[225:30.63]Let's just get over there and do it.
[225:34.54]Don't lose anybody.
[225:35.14]Come on.
[225:37.80]Don't walk into the wall either.
[225:40.08]Somebody did.
[225:45.51]I'm here at CVS.
[225:46.27]What should I get?
[225:46.75]Yeah, I'll get a coconut water.
[225:48.95]These things are really good.
[225:52.49]Oh, is it over here?
[225:52.97]Over here.
[226:02.32]Coconut water, yeah.
[226:04.24]You guys don't like coconut water?
[226:07.48]It's good stuff, I
[226:16.99]Almost 20 years older than me.
[226:22.61]Yeah, it's kind of crazy, yeah.
[226:25.98]Wait, what?
[226:36.68]Wait, I can understand.
[226:37.48]Wait, like 10, 12, 5?
[226:38.46]15? 15?
[226:48.49]Is there any nectar in here?
[226:49.13]Alright, now... What do I want here?
[226:55.89]I'm looking for other treasure that's out in the open.
[227:05.48]I need more treasures.
[227:10.84]I want more out in the open treasure.
[227:13.58]Or ones that can be dug.
[227:16.12]Needle's moving.
[227:18.79]Vito's moving a little bit.
[227:19.57]You see that?
[227:25.64]It's bouncing a little bit.
[227:26.52]Ooh, I see one.
[227:29.54]Any thoughts on baked ham?
[227:31.24]That's good.
[227:33.78]It's good.
[227:34.08]I think it's worth eating.
[227:42.22]And what is that?
[227:43.68]Oh, that's not treasure.
[227:44.52]Okay.
[227:52.59]It's good.
[227:53.07]No!
[227:59.70]Give him back!
[228:07.17]Red ones do 25% more damage, right?
[228:20.11]Do you submerge castle?
[228:21.37]No, I'm not doing that again.
[228:22.43]I just want to collect treasures for a little bit.
[228:35.58]We got EOTWV.
[228:36.76]We got EOTWV coming up.
[228:39.22]EOTWV.
[228:40.73]Slower, so it sounds better.
[228:42.19]EOTWV.
[228:47.07]End of the... No, E-O-S-T.
[228:51.97]E-O-W.
[228:58.16]What's the W?
[228:58.76]End of the world stream?
[229:02.92]There's still shit out here that I need.
[229:10.72]End of the world voice.
[229:13.39]Well, you know, guys, looking out my window right now, there's actually a huge burning red circle above us.
[229:22.30]It's huge.
[229:23.00]And it's getting closer.
[229:23.86]So, I mean, an end of the world voice, I guess.
[229:38.77]Yeah, we'll be back tomorrow though.
[229:40.81]Tomorrow we're going to be playing Slime Rancher.
[229:43.01]It's another highly requested game.
[229:46.01]You want my final opinions on Pikmin 2?
[229:47.85]It was good.
[229:48.71]It was very good.
[229:50.85]I liked it a lot.
[229:51.91]I see why people love this series.
[229:53.15]I see why people like the game.
[229:55.00]Very stressful, very hard.
[229:56.02]Submerged Castle, one of the hardest levels from what I've been told.
[230:01.74]I think it's really fun though.
[230:03.66]I like it.
[230:05.18]Finish it then.
[230:05.78]I did.
[230:06.56]I paid off all the debt.
[230:07.28]I'm doing extra content.
[230:09.29]We saw the credits.
[230:15.67]Land on his head.
[230:27.26]He didn't get to the true ending.
[230:32.46]People drowning?
[230:34.60]Get out of the water.
[230:37.68]Where's this last piece of treasure?
[230:39.00]Is there a dog?
[230:42.16]It's a hot dog.
[230:43.54]Hold on, let me get him.
[230:44.88]He wants to come in.
[231:30.50]he wants to come in but he's he's he is staring at me he's just like he wants I think he wants me to do something for him what is it what's the matter you just want to stare at me do you like pigment
[231:55.01]He said, yes, I would eat a Pikmin.
[231:58.65]Would you eat one of these Pikmin?
[231:59.81]Yes.
[231:59.95]What do you mean?
[232:10.76]He's like a Bulby.
[232:11.48]He's one of those Bulb things.
[232:14.84]Oh, I need to get up there.
[232:19.79]He didn't say that.
[232:24.10]He didn't say that.
[232:29.47]No, wrong button.
[232:39.93]You guys ever press the minus button on your Wiimote and it doesn't do anything?
[232:46.09]I think I just hate this controller.
[232:48.21]Seriously.
[232:51.03]I think I just really hate the Wii mode in Nunchuck.
[232:53.43]I think I hate it.
[232:55.97]What?
[232:56.23]Okay.
[232:56.53]What's the... Did I put this on a tier list?
[233:00.61]Have I ever done a tier list with the Wii mode on it?
[233:05.09]With game controllers?
[233:06.17]I don't think I've ever done it.
[233:14.11]I think I have to do that.
[233:14.87]This would be somewhere at the bottom.
[233:18.49]Alright, treasure, come on.
[233:20.79]Secret treasure.
[233:21.33]I think, yeah, I have.
[233:27.00]I think I have.
[233:28.50]Oh, here we go.
[233:29.80]Where is it?
[233:32.14]Shit.
[233:32.54]Okay, hold on.
[233:40.96]This is going to be really difficult.
[233:42.00]I need just yellow.
[233:46.75]Only that yellow is the only one I want.
[233:48.15]We're going to go very slow here.
[233:49.57]We have to wrap around.
[233:51.47]It's going to be really difficult.
[233:56.85]No, it's not.
[233:57.39]Can I throw it up there?
[233:59.11]Can we reach from here?
[234:02.88]Ooh.
[234:07.74]Got it.
[234:08.14]Nice.
[234:08.38]OK, so how do they bring it down?
[234:15.53]Hell yeah.
[234:16.31]We got it.
[234:26.69]We need to save Louie.
[234:31.56]Do I, though?
[234:32.34]He's not even in the third game.
[234:37.04]Louie in canon.
[234:38.36]He's gone.
[234:39.18]He's only in the multiplayer mode in Pikmin 3, isn't he?
[234:44.38]Get more people on that faster.
[234:54.52]Irma's bored?
[234:55.18]I'm not... No, I'm just like chilling.
[235:03.20]You understand, I did... I had to sit there and just do 20 minutes of annoying voices.
[235:09.68]Fuck, that's like... I did that already.
[235:11.51]What I'm using that as an excuse as to why, oh, I'm like just relaxing.
[235:16.01]I run like this for 20 minutes.
[235:18.71]Oh boy.
[235:22.61]Vlasic Pickle, cool.
[235:30.23]There's still other treasure here.
[235:32.25]It's probably buried.
[235:36.17]What about over here?
[235:40.04]It was something to do over this way, wasn't there?
[235:41.30]Remember I was like throwing people up here?
[235:51.02]What, now you want to get out?
[235:51.72]Do you need to go outside?
[235:58.11]You want to go outside?
[235:59.72]He needs to go out.
[236:01.50]He's giving me those eyes.
[236:08.72]Yeah, he's giving me the eyes.
[236:09.57]Alright, let me take him out.
[236:12.77]And I'll come back.
[236:14.49]I'll do one more day.
[236:17.11]I'll do one more day and then we'll call it.
[236:20.58]Let me go let him outside though.
[236:22.18]I'll be right back.
[236:54.67]Thank you.
[244:30.89]Okay, hello.
[244:32.15]Sorry that took a while.
[244:35.57]What is that?
[244:39.31]Some of you need Jesus.
[244:40.43]Okay.
[244:50.02]Let's do one more day and then I'm gonna go.
[244:55.52]Some of you need Jesus.
[245:01.27]Wait, what does this say?
[245:04.02]Life is pain.
[245:04.86]No, not that.
[245:05.36]This.
[245:07.16]What about Louie?
[245:08.06]Louie is gonna be fine.
[245:14.91]Catboy of Wall Street.

[246:18.57]Oh, yeah.
[246:18.99]This is where the do the voice for 20 minutes thing came from, right?
[246:23.01]Oh, yeah.
[246:23.41]I haven't even looked around.
[246:24.25]I forgot about that.
[246:27.37]You're right.
[246:35.96]I get more.
[246:37.36]How did you forget?
[246:43.29]Well, I didn't forget about that.
[246:45.89]I just forgot that it was here.
[246:46.83]Let's get more yellow.
[246:50.69]I have a lot of yellows, don't I?
[246:51.59]Yeah, whatever.
[246:53.47]Some more blue.
[246:56.14]Yes, more blue.
[246:57.12]Go.
[247:02.78]Go to the dream den.
[247:03.98]It's the final boss.
[247:04.90]I don't even know what that is.
[247:07.42]Dream den.
[247:10.98]Well, let me explore.
[247:16.50]Some egg we're going to get.
[247:17.24]There's going to be collapse upon thing here.
[247:19.25]These eggs are not real.
[247:33.97]Six whites and four purple.
[247:36.39]He's ready.
[247:37.10]I would be very surprised if you were not kidding.
[247:43.16]There's no way I'm ready.
[247:50.17]You need a hundred purple Pikmin for that fight.
[247:54.59]I'm definitely not going to do that.
[248:09.64]That's right.
[248:09.98]The bridge right here.
[248:11.16]But this is like weird guy.
[248:12.30]Alright.

[248:52.14]Come on, get over here.
[248:54.57]Can I make that?

[251:24.95]I'm done.
[251:25.35]The full letter grade just dropped.
[251:29.25]This was like an 80... This was like an 87.
[251:30.75]It's now a 75.
[251:34.41]Just because of this part right here.
[251:35.69]I'm done.
[251:43.66]Look at the Wiimote.
[251:44.40]Look at the Wiimote.
[251:46.24]That's not me doing that.
[252:04.24]And look at those huge guys in there.
[252:06.78]This is a gauntlet.
[252:07.98]Everybody get out of here.
[252:08.68]I'm going the other way.
[252:22.50]What's this?
[252:30.88]Ease frame.
[252:32.24]Be careful.
[252:34.96]God, give me a break.
[252:40.51]From all appearances, this is a particularly frightening crevice.
[252:43.19]The data is horrifying.
[252:47.39]courage is one thing but recklessness is something else perhaps we should turn back can we just can I go in from here or do I have to get hit by this still wish to enter keep your daring in check okay
[253:26.84]I just want... I just want to see the space... So you... Alright.
[253:31.68]So you're telling me... That rock... Went through here.
[253:36.64]Didn't hit me or this... The boss guy.
[253:40.78]Wrapped all the way around.
[253:41.86]And then spun around and ran everybody over.
[253:45.10]Why did it not hit this?
[253:46.10]Or this?
[253:46.60]Or me?
[253:47.04]Or here?
[253:47.46]Or here?
[253:48.10]Why was that so perfect?
[253:52.75]It didn't hit the edge of the cave?
[253:56.05]It went all the way around and didn't hit the wall and then came all the way back around and rolled over everybody.
[254:00.79]Why?
[254:02.65]It's a fucking 71.
[254:03.43]Oh wait, but the bulb creatures are in the game?
[254:12.94]Alright, it just went up to a 78.
[254:14.36]That's right.
[254:18.00]That's right.
[254:24.31]That's really important.
[254:27.33]Well, I need more Pikmin.
[254:43.96]We're sitting here raiding a game all over the place.
[254:47.62]What about the treasure?
[254:48.46]I yeah, I know I need more Pikmin to get over there.
[254:58.74]I have something in front of the sensor bar.
[255:02.22]Yeah, like toxic air.
[255:11.49]Criticizing a 20 year old game, Omegalo.
[255:16.79]No, I'm putting myself back in time when I had a Wii.
[255:22.09]And I would have been sitting on my couch at 480p saying the same shit.
[255:31.16]Only this time I have like a pair of cockies on.
[255:33.74]Ooh, what's this?
[255:40.33]Oh, it's one of these guys.
[255:41.51]Hold on.
[255:41.79]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[255:49.41]Sacrifice you.
[255:53.27]Look at how scrumptious he looks.
[255:56.51]Oh no, sacrifice the blue one.
[255:59.61]Come on out.
[256:01.92]Don't they look scrumptious?
[256:07.80]There we go.
[256:12.95]Get him!
[256:15.67]Not... Why were there... This motherfucker just said cookies.
[256:25.45]No, I didn't.
[256:25.87]I said cockies.
[256:28.41]Packies.
[256:28.95]What do you want?
[256:39.42]Come out and get him.
[256:42.26]Pants?
[256:42.76]Like, cockies.
[256:46.32]Cacky pants.
[256:47.28]Cackies.
[256:48.66]I can't kill this guy.
[257:01.61]Like, just come out.
[257:04.64]I want... If I had my fucking cockies on right now, man, I would throw this Weevil into the drywall.
[257:14.01]I swear to God.
[257:15.51]Like, what the fuck?
[257:17.29]Come out and... Come out!
[257:27.38]Just get out!
[257:28.42]Come out!
[257:52.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[257:54.95]That rolls up here.
[257:55.67]This game gets a five.
[257:56.91]Okay.
[257:57.77]Good.
[258:02.72]Okay.
[258:12.69]Get him!
[258:56.97]Pikmin are just bullets you can carry.
[258:58.45]I wouldn't call them bullets.
[259:14.30]Where's my Mario 64 camera?
[259:15.96]Like, the hitting Z thing.
[259:17.36]Like, what is this?
[259:17.86]Resident Evil fucking 4?
[259:19.34]Give me a break.
[259:23.48]Like, why can't I just... I just want to turn the camera.
[259:30.97]Tilted.
[259:35.91]Drain that water.
[259:36.85]Quickly.
[259:37.29]I think I can do it.
[259:43.53]Burn everybody.
[259:44.53]He hasn't decided who he's going to do it to yet.
[259:49.29]Burn me.
[259:49.71]Burn me instead.
[259:50.45]Burn me.
[259:51.12]Burn me instead.
[259:57.68]He's in water.
[259:58.22]It doesn't work.
[260:14.10]What was that?
[260:17.52]Nothing?
[260:18.10]There's no cave there?
[260:18.90]Alright, well now I can do that next time.
[260:24.30]And his electric fence.
[260:24.96]Alright, I'm giving it one more day.
[260:26.36]One more day.
[260:27.08]One more day.
[260:27.42]That was bullshit.
[260:28.24]One more day.
[260:48.64]Do they not die if you're at the base?
[260:55.26]If they're in the squad, they're fine.
[260:58.14]As long as they're in your party or in your team, right?
[261:02.62]How do you get this far in?
[261:03.56]This is kind of all we've been doing.
[261:06.32]The last three streams.
[261:18.24]We have no idea where Louie is.
[261:19.40]That's it.
[261:19.60]Louie is dead.
[261:20.06]Sorry.
[261:56.30]Or just, just ignore.
[261:57.76]Just act like it's the wrong number.
[262:02.42]Louie.
[262:03.06]Uh, there ain't no Louie here.
[262:05.54]Uh, you might have the wrong email.
[262:11.33]I have the wrong email.
[262:13.93]Louie Smith at Hokatateindustries.com.
[262:20.25]This is his email.
[262:22.31]I think you might've got the wrong guy.
[262:23.85]Wrong email.
[262:38.73]Alright, 94.
[262:41.13]2.
[262:41.85]Shit, this is bad.
[262:44.25]No Louie here, just ooey gooey here.
[262:51.24]I'm surprised you knew the name of the industry.
[262:55.36]Okay, look, I might have ADHD and I might have a lot of attention problems, but I mean, like... That's... I've been playing the game for like 14 hours.
[263:07.13]If I didn't know what Hokatate Industries was, I feel like I wouldn't be paying attention to anything in the game.
[263:13.51]I mean, I mean anything.
[263:25.18]Drink up.
[263:29.70]Alright.
[263:30.26]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[263:31.84]I'm ready.
[263:39.17]I want to go back that way.
[263:43.21]We need to run.
[263:43.79]Oh, this guy's hitting himself.
[263:48.34]Wait, we can drop death from above.
[263:49.68]Here we go.
[264:02.26]Alright.
[264:03.30]I'm getting at least one treasure from here.
[264:05.13]You better believe it.
[264:13.09]There's a fire guy over here.
[264:14.85]There's one fire guy.
[264:16.37]Take care of him.
[264:28.54]There's a water guy over here.
[264:29.76]Take care of the water guy.
[264:34.78]And then the electric fence needs to be taken care of by the electric guys.
[264:38.00]Alright, let's go.
[264:41.33]You guys good?
[264:43.97]You guys alright?
[264:45.89]Wait, what is going on right now?
[264:47.15]Who's doing that?
[264:48.57]What is killing them?
[264:49.17]What's going on?
[264:49.93]Hello?
[264:50.21]I couldn't even see.
[264:54.08]They're, like, landing on the ground.
[264:55.18]They should have just made the ground concrete in this game.
[265:00.44]Like, it's so ugly.
[265:03.20]Okay, I'm just kidding.
[265:04.24]I'm sorry.
[265:28.05]Oops.
[265:33.11]All I'm saying is it should have been a cartoon.
[265:38.79]Like what were they?
[265:39.35]Come on.
[265:40.89]This is a perfect cartoon.
[265:43.77]Pikmin 1, Pikmin 2, Pikmin 3.
[265:48.14]Where's the animated series?
[265:49.46]That'd be so awesome.
[265:52.26]Are there animated shorts?
[265:53.82]Are there really?
[265:54.24]Come here, guys.
[266:05.79]There is?
[266:06.09]That's cool.
[266:12.15]I would love a little cartoon.
[266:13.01]Make them in the animated series.
[266:15.07]It'd be awesome.
[266:20.77]Come on, hurry up.
[266:23.79]Get in there and do something.
[266:44.95]Watch the shorts on YouTube?
[266:46.27]I don't know if I can.
[266:47.05]I'm kind of scared to do that.
[266:52.53]Is it really have we gotten to the point where I'm afraid to watch a YouTube video of a show or something?
[267:03.54]It is technically a Nintendo video, right?
[267:22.54]Nintendo doesn't fuck around anymore.
[267:24.71]No.
[267:32.77]Entertainment is illegal, didn't you know that?
[267:34.41]Yeah, well, I know people saying, what about Bionicle?
[267:37.31]Yeah, Bionicle is free to watch on YouTube.
[267:39.42]That does not mean it is free for me to distribute on my stream.
[267:44.44]There's a lot of legality there.
[267:48.34]Oh my God, I need that Pinecon.
[267:57.10]I do not have the broadcasting rights to the Bionicle movie.
[268:00.56]That's how this works.
[268:02.57]Just because something is free does not mean that I can just do whatever I want with it.
[268:07.73]Just hold up a controller and pretend it's a video game.
[268:09.85]Didn't somebody do that at one point for like a Super Bowl?
[268:20.13]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[268:21.56]Hurry, hurry up, please.
[268:23.70]We're good.
[268:25.36]It was UFC.
[268:26.72]That's so stupid.
[268:30.18]That's unbelievable.
[268:36.91]But now I, I cannot just stream the Bionicle movie.
[268:41.21]I do not have the rights to, I don't have the broadcasting rights to Bionicle, which I need to be able to show that on stream.
[268:55.28]And correct me if I'm wrong here, but Bionicle is Disney, is it not?
[268:59.42]I don't think that's going to happen.
[269:04.34]Isn't that underneath the Disney umbrella?
[269:11.13]It's a Lego.
[269:11.69]Hold on, Bionicle...
[269:25.99]Bionicle.
[269:31.19]Who owns Bionicle?
[269:37.31]Lego would never be able to watch it.
[269:38.95]Yeah, Lego.
[269:40.43]Wait, yeah, Lego is Bionicle, but who owns Lego?
[269:43.39]Is Lego just Lego?
[269:44.19]Doesn't somebody own Lego?
[269:50.12]Is it Warner?
[269:54.15]Lego just is Lego.
[269:55.03]But who has the rights to the Lego movies and stuff?
[269:57.89]And Lego media?
[270:00.11]TV shows and stuff?
[270:07.06]John Lego!
[270:15.88]I thought it was Disney.
[270:16.66]I thought Disney had the broadcasting rights to Bionicle or something.
[270:20.53]I don't know why I thought that.
[270:21.47]I don't know where I got that from.
[270:22.45]Where did I get that from?
[270:29.19]they do okay so I was right this person be extremely careful all the Mario job is to protect his life at all costs
[270:49.62]Hello, it's me, Mr. Bionicle.
[270:51.36]Jerva, go right ahead.
[270:53.42]Thank you, Mr. Bionicle.
[270:54.60]I really appreciate that.
[271:01.81]Okay, I got treasures over here, but where is it?
[271:09.78]Oh, fuck.
[271:10.92]Run away.
[271:18.48]Holy shit, there's too many things over here.
[271:28.63]Yeah, the Lego group is owned by a certain company, but the distribution rights to the Bionicle movies I don't think is Lego.
[271:34.85]That's what I'm trying to say.
[271:46.83]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[271:50.73]I think I'm just dead here.
[271:55.13]It is Disney.
[271:56.49]People saying no, it is.
[271:57.29]I think it is though.
[271:58.31]I actually do think it is.
[272:02.43]It's distributed by Buena Vista, which is Disney, right?
[272:05.11]Yeah, I had it right.
[272:05.81]There's too many enemies here.
[272:29.63]This is just a mess.
[272:30.77]This is a mess right now.
[272:39.39]Didn't I drain this water already?
[272:40.59]I thought I already drained this.
[272:53.83]Oh, whatever.
[272:54.15]This place is cool, but not really.
[273:09.05]Disney does not have rights.
[273:14.63]Okay, regardless if it's Disney or Warner or Buena Vista or Paramount, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[273:22.24]It's not me.
[273:23.12]I can't stream it.
[273:37.39]buy out windows Vista no buena Vista okay I'm mad I'll see you guys tomorrow buy them you millionaire listen if even if I let's just say I had let's just say I was right let's just say I was a millionaire you know how much it's gonna cost to buy bionicle probably like more than yeah I gotta probably add a zero or two
[274:06.57]It's probably quite a few zeros to buy Bionicle to stream it.
[274:11.89]The one movie.
[274:14.87]I guarantee it's at least 10 million to buy the rights to Bionicle.
[274:20.42]And that would be a steal.
[274:33.05]I got some treasure, though.
[274:34.87]Ask them nicely.
[274:35.57]You know, who knows?
[274:36.73]I've reached out.
[274:45.36]I got a guy working on it.
[274:46.88]We'll see.
[274:47.74]Probably not, though.
[274:48.46]Don't get your hopes up.
[274:55.92]Okay, if I do, if I end up ever getting the rights to actually broadcast that on stream, you do understand that to be able to do that, I probably have to sign an agreement.
[275:03.37]That means I cannot, I probably can't, like, say, like, dog shit on stream anymore.
[275:08.79]That would have to be a very, I think, family-friendly stream if I was given the rights by whatever group owns it to distribute it on, when watching on stream.
[275:16.32]Okay, we're back.
[275:21.28]And I'm back to this bridge will stay, but, well, it's alright, whatever, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[275:38.17]I got a new cave, but now, yeah, that's it.
[275:40.17]That's it.
[275:45.79]We'll see you tomorrow.
[275:50.79]Signed off, it's still playing.
[275:51.87]No, no, no, no.
[275:52.79]I got my fun out of it.
[275:53.55]I have my fun in Pikmin.
[275:56.95]So the amount of times that I said I hate this controller versus this was a really fun game.
[276:01.00]That was a cool thing I just saw.
[276:02.76]What's the ratio there?
[276:07.09]4 to 1?
[276:08.77]5 to 1?
[276:09.92]It's at least like 5 to 1, right?
[276:12.42]I give Pikmin 2 a 76.
[276:16.72]And then in brackets, plus 5.
[276:20.36]With GameCube controller.
[276:21.16]How's that sound?
[276:32.66]Pretty good score?
[276:33.26]It is.
[276:35.06]I enjoyed it very much so.
[276:44.71]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[276:45.87]We're going to do Slime Rancher tomorrow, which is just another Pikmin.
[276:48.41]It's just another cute little blue, red, yellow, purple, orange monsters that you throw around.
[276:58.64]Is it a completely different game?
[277:02.54]We'll see you tomorrow.
[277:04.54]Have a great rest of your night.
[277:07.86]Let's do the credits.
[277:11.25]What time?
[277:11.67]2 p.m.
[277:12.91]Pacific time.
[277:13.71]2 p.m.
[277:14.97]Pacific.
[277:15.99]Same time we started today.
[277:16.77]If you're going to be around, maybe we'll see you.
[277:20.07]If not, then have a great night.
[277:23.61]Thanks for watching, as always.
[277:24.55]This has been Pikmin 2.
[277:27.55]I now have access to a Wii U. So if there's something that is worth playing on the Wii U, and I do have it, and I don't think I've ever really streamed anything on the Wii U,
[277:40.66]I did a bunch of Wii stuff.
[277:42.84]But I don't think I've ever really done a Wii U game.
[277:46.15]Do Pikmin 3.
[277:46.79]I don't know.
[277:50.47]Maybe.
[277:52.15]It's literally only Pikmin 3 is the only one.
[277:57.19]We'll see.
[277:57.97]I'll give it a look.
[277:58.43]Alright, here come the subs.
[278:03.19]Thanks, everybody.
[278:07.76]It's insane how many people have subbed to this channel.
[278:12.60]still I don't I sometimes I just I just wonder if I stare at the ceiling and I'm like how can this many people want to give me five dollars a month I don't understand but thanks I really appreciate it nonetheless is it Plants vs. Zombies HD they really kind of ruined that franchise didn't they
[278:41.29]That went completely 180 real quickly, didn't it?
[278:43.25]That went from one of the most beloved everyone at PAX has the funny mask on and the cone on their head to this is the most disgusting awful shitty game shitty practice ever by a company ever and no one cares about I almost said Portal 2, Pikmin 2 Plants vs. Zombies 2
[279:10.96]If you want to see a total 180 of community engagement versus hatred of an entire franchise, look no further than Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[279:21.94]I remember playing Plants vs. Zombies 2, and I was, my face melted off, essentially, with how I could not understand, and I was just flabbergasted.
[279:33.34]You needed to pay fucking money to, like, do well in that game.
[279:37.24]That's all I remembered.
[279:40.67]I remember it was, I got like 20, 30 levels in or something.
[279:44.25]Oh, this is kind of fun.
[279:45.23]But then it was like, you like, you're getting overwhelmed unless you like use the super electrocution devices and stuff.
[279:52.79]So what ended up happening is I just ended up having a bunch of the electrocution, like super kill though, that just wiped the screen things.
[279:58.88]And I didn't play the game anymore.
[280:01.42]I just opened a level, waited for enough stuff was to be loaded onto the screen and then kill everything with the electricity.
[280:09.42]I didn't even play the game.
[280:10.50]It was horrendous.
[280:11.70]That was one of the worst games I've ever played.
[280:15.40]I didn't really mean that.
[280:16.16]That was one of the stupidest things I've ever played.
[280:24.53]It's insane how bad they fucked up.
[280:25.85]That first game is unironically fantastic.
[280:27.81]Oh yeah, a lot of the PopCap stuff was unironically fantastic.
[280:33.23]It was just egregious, horrendous business practices.
[280:41.19]And notice how you've... Do they even talk about Plants vs. Zombies?
[280:43.73]They have that Garden Warfare game, but... I'll be honest, I don't... I don't care at all about that.
[280:49.56]I wanted, like, a Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[280:51.74]Or Plants vs. Zombies 3 or something.
[280:55.05]I've actually heard that it's not bad.
[280:56.37]I've heard that Garden Warfare is actually pretty fun.
[280:59.67]But...
[281:01.67]To me, that's the side series, right?
[281:04.86]That's not the main series.
[281:07.38]They've got Plants vs. Zombies, Plants vs. Zombies 2, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
[281:11.18]It's a really kind of fun FPS game.
[281:12.60]Go check it out, maybe.
[281:13.88]But I want a main Plants vs. Zombies game that's not just on the App Store.
[281:21.32]Dude, move on.
[281:22.60]No, I'm not going to move on.
[281:23.39]This is an incredibly important topic to me.
[281:25.21]I'm not going to move on.
[281:25.93]This is like, move on?
[281:27.99]Move on, Jeremy?
[281:28.89]Just go?
[281:29.53]Move on?
[281:33.77]Alright, I'm going to move on because this thing just beeped at me.
[281:38.53]And I got kind of scared.
[281:40.89]I heard something in my ear.
[281:44.73]I heard... And I thought that somebody did something.
[281:52.13]Alright, I'll see you later.
[281:53.15]Have a great rest of your night.
[281:53.99]See you tomorrow.
[281:54.95]I'm going to play Slime Rancher tomorrow.
[281:56.99]Good night, guys.
[281:58.09]Take care of yourselves.
[281:58.91]We'll see you soon.
[282:03.83]Wednesday, Archaeology Stream, March 6th at 1 o'clock Pacific.
[282:07.94]I'm going to be digging up all kinds of interesting things, probably.
[282:14.61]Get your shovels ready.
[282:15.41]We'll see you later.
[282:21.43]Good night.
[282:40.88]you
[283:15.76]Thank you.
