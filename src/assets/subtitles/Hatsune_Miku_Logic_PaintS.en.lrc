[00:00.01]Funny Thanksgiving Special Miku Picross It's not a funny Thanksgiving, it's just a Thanksgiving wine downstream I'm gonna talk very very lightly, very slowly
[00:16.79]write ones in chat if you just kind of got the notification that I was live and you're on the couch and you got the phone in one hand and one of your eyes are open looking at it you're just kind of on the couch just oh shit it's live I'm just gonna chill today I'm not gonna talk loud I'm gonna do some Miku Picross what do you mean two?
[00:45.92]What do you mean, two?
[00:46.88]Where are you?
[00:50.34]ASMR Andy.
[00:53.56]We're gonna play... Alright, so let's go over this.
[00:55.74]I know a lot of people are like, what are you doing?
[00:58.94]I saw that Miku Picross came out two days ago.
[01:03.41]Three days ago.
[01:03.97]I was like, oh, remember I played that Miku game?
[01:08.21]And everyone was like, oh, everyone loved it.
[01:11.57]I love Picross.
[01:13.71]Of course, I'm going to play the Miku Picross game that comes out.
[01:18.39]And I don't want to hear it from people in chat that this game came out a year ago on the Switch.
[01:24.66]I am a PC CD-ROM player.
[01:31.74]But yeah, let's just chill.
[01:33.90]We're going to do a relaxing Thanksgiving wind down.
[01:37.35]Maybe the stream will, I don't know, maybe a couple hours, two, three hours just to relax.
[01:43.02]Don't need to do anything crazy today just to chill.
[01:44.86]Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.
[01:53.88]I know in offline chat people were saying that I should do the Thanksgiving tier list.
[01:57.38]Already did it.
[01:59.48]But if you just need a quick refresh.
[02:03.86]Hold on, I'm going to.
[02:05.17]I don't want to like burping on you.
[02:12.01]Okay, so Thanksgiving tier list, I believe stuffing and mashed, stuffing is S tier.
[02:19.01]It's the highest thing.
[02:20.98]Mashed potatoes are also somewhere around early S, maybe A, maybe mid A, mid S. And there's a lot of new viewers.
[02:33.94]So let's go over this.
[02:36.21]And I told you we were gonna relax today, but I'm gonna get a little angry right now because people are gonna get mad at me and I'm gonna get angry back.
[02:43.13]This is the only time we're gonna get an elevated vocal range here, okay?
[02:48.25]So, I think that canned cranberry sauce is 100 times better than real cranberry sauce.
[03:02.61]The stuff that's in the can.
[03:04.15]That comes out, and it's shaped like a can when it comes out.
[03:08.51]Like a cartoon.
[03:10.63]And when that... Listen.
[03:13.55]When you turn that sideways, so it's the shape of the can, cranberry sauce.
[03:18.54]It's more like a cranberry jelly.
[03:22.22]exactly you turn it sideways and you slice hockey pucks a little bit thinner than a hockey puck but hockey puck hockey puck hockey puck hockey puck spatula that up get it on your plate you now have the opportunity
[03:41.34]to take cranberry jelly, cranberry sauce, whenever you want.
[03:45.63]It's not going to get all over everything.
[03:47.51]Sometimes you don't want cranberry sauce all over your mashed potatoes and the turkey and the potato, you know what I'm saying?
[03:54.95]It gives you the opportunity to take a sliver of that cranberry puck and put cream cheese spread it onto the turkey.
[04:06.04]I'm telling you, that's S+.
[04:14.97]Hockey, like hockey puck size, not hockey puck texture or flavor.
[04:24.60]It had to be, okay.
[04:27.04]It had to be hovered right over the end stream button and I pressed space accidentally.
[04:35.72]Well, alright.
[04:37.19]I'm live, I'm here.
[04:38.25]What a bad stream.
[04:49.77]I just go live for two minutes to talk about how much I like hockey puck cranberry sauce and leave.
[04:55.81]That actually is kind of funny, and I could have just stuck with that.
[05:03.93]I apologize for those of you that... Let's get... Should I explain this again for everyone that just came back?
[05:11.63]I need to explain this because people are going to be like, what the fuck happened?
[05:14.05]Wait for people to refresh.
[05:21.62]You have 20 more seconds.
[05:24.84]Okay.
[05:26.26]Alright, so I'm imagining people have refreshed.
[05:29.10]Let's just go over really quickly what just happened.
[05:30.94]So I hit the press- I hit the go live button on my OBS over here, and didn't move the mouse.
[05:36.69]I just pressed go live, and now here I am, and I'm talking to you, right?
[05:39.25]Like, after a minute or so.
[05:40.67]I didn't move the mouse.
[05:42.35]So I accidentally,- in a rage, talking about, um, the cranberry sauce, hit spacebar, which is confirm, and it was hovering over the end stream button because I never moved the mouse.
[05:53.14]There you go.
[05:53.98]So now I don't have to explain it again.
[05:55.48]We should probably wait another few minutes and I'll explain it again for people to refresh another five minutes or so.
[06:08.73]Alright, so...
[06:10.70]Today, it's going to be a chill Miku Picross stream.
[06:15.26]I have no idea what's in this game.
[06:17.76]All I know is that I love Picross.
[06:20.30]And, I mean, I've played the Miku game.
[06:22.35]Why not?
[06:22.75]These are two things that I've played them.
[06:30.71]Yeah, we're only going to be live for maybe a couple hours.
[06:32.81]I don't know.
[06:34.08]I want to do this thing.
[06:34.76]I. I want to start doing more of this.
[06:39.14]And I kind of had this like epiphany and this is I'm like not joking around.
[06:41.50]I'm like I mean this completely and fully.
[06:45.16]I kind of like the idea of every so often just going live.
[06:50.58]And it's we just kind of chill and hang out maybe for a couple hours or something just randomly.
[06:55.17]I like that idea a lot.
[06:57.03]A little bit more low energy stream sometimes.
[06:59.93]Because I feel like I'm so high energy all the time and that's like the only thing you ever see.
[07:06.43]Right, like I'm always like so high energy, but like it's like it's like five six o'clock in the afternoon evening I think we maybe I could like maybe we get a couple of chill streams every now and again, right?
[07:22.09]I I know and look you can have a chill stream and scream sometimes.
[07:27.17]I know that sounds weird, but it happens
[07:33.43]I know I'm like, we're going to just chill out.
[07:34.93]I know that I'm going to get the question wrong and I'm going to scream.
[07:39.57]But it's alright.
[07:40.24]We're still chilling out.
[07:41.38]We're just hanging out, right?
[07:44.40]You need to hit the bong.
[07:46.46]No, no.
[07:49.46]But I'll tell you, that's where opportunities like me strong playthrough, right?
[07:55.61]Bring back the comb streams.
[07:56.67]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[08:00.23]could have you know this high energy streams and there's low energy streams I think it's a nice experiment to see how this works but I'm ready uh how do you have a low energy stream when like miku is just banging like just blaring in the background like if when miku is just like what's the song
[08:30.65]No, that was wrong.
[08:31.67]I did the wrong song.
[08:32.83]That was Nyan Cat.
[08:36.73]Everybody chill out.
[08:38.28]This is supposed to be a relaxing night.
[08:40.44]This is supposed to be a relaxing night.
[08:43.54]That was Nyan Cat.
[08:44.84]Alright.
[08:45.18]I'm sorry.
[08:45.98]I got it wrong.
[08:48.30]Isn't there a... No, no.
[08:49.71]I had it right.
[08:50.29]I did have it right.
[08:52.91]That's a Miku song.
[08:54.33]I'm telling... Everybody, this is a real Thanksgiving relax stream.
[08:59.44]True Miku fan.
[09:00.36]That's right.
[09:01.82]So when that's just blaring in the background, it's going to be hard to relax.
[09:04.82]Alright, everybody relax.
[09:07.07]We need to collectively just hang out.
[09:09.59]Okay.
[09:10.01]Alright.
[09:10.47]I'm pressing the button.
[09:13.91]Can you guys hear it?
[09:17.65]I can't hear it.
[09:19.84]When is the chill going to happen?
[09:20.80]We're chilling as of exact.
[09:24.02]Hey, look, I'm early too.
[09:25.28]The stream hasn't even started yet.
[09:28.56]And you can play Fall Guys.
[09:29.58]I'm not going to ever play Fall Guys ever again.
[09:36.51]I'm just telling you that's a fact.
[09:38.65]I don't have anything against the game.
[09:39.93]I'm just never playing that game.
[09:41.71]Ever.
[09:43.43]Ever again.
[09:44.13]It's a fun, cute game.
[09:46.05]It's like a fun experience.
[09:47.03]I'm just never going to play it ever again.
[09:48.53]That's it.
[09:55.80]What's up?
[09:59.43]Face reveal?
[10:00.15]Alright, so here we go.
[10:03.58]Picross is fun.
[10:05.24]If you've never played it before, you're about to see how it works.
[10:07.66]Okay, last time I played Picross, I explained how Picross works every 30 seconds.
[10:14.78]So, I'm not going to do that tonight.
[10:17.37]We're just going to chill and play it.
[10:18.75]What happened to your face?
[10:22.05]I haven't shaved in like a week.
[10:23.65]That's what happened.
[10:25.82]Okay, so normal puzzles, special puzzles, music, gallery, settings.
[10:33.88]I already did the settings a little bit.
[10:37.35]Listen to music and unlock new songs.
[10:39.13]How do I do that?
[10:41.21]How do I do that?
[10:41.73]Oh, I need money.
[10:47.11]Well, you guys have to tell me which one you think is good.
[10:49.42]Oh, we can unlock music.
[10:57.03]Why does your chin have cell shading?
[11:02.23]I don't know.
[11:02.65]Alright, let's play.
[11:06.17]Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[11:07.43]Hope you had a good one.
[11:08.99]Hope you had a lot of turkey.
[11:10.21]A lot of... And all that good stuff.
[11:13.94]Alright, so here we go.
[11:14.62]So these are gonna be really easy.
[11:15.88]These are gonna be, like... It's gonna be impossible for me to lose these.
[11:20.38]So let's go.
[11:22.02]Level 1.
[11:22.78]Here we go.
[11:23.00]Wait, I gotta move the camera.
[11:28.65]Actually, that's not a bad place for it.
[11:29.75]Eh, this is fine over here.
[11:32.43]Is there a timer?
[11:32.97]There is.
[11:33.21]Alright, so how Picross works... I'm not doing that.
[11:36.53]Stop.
[11:36.85]Okay, there's the five.
[11:41.44]I didn't mean to press that.
[11:42.70]It just went over there.
[11:43.74]I'm restarting.
[11:44.26]Okay.
[11:50.62]That's that row of five.
[11:52.02]All five.
[11:52.54]Do I have to explain this?
[11:58.93]Alright, so hold on.
[11:59.47]Paint?
[12:00.64]What is check?
[12:01.94]Because X is mark.
[12:04.36]B is check.
[12:06.26]Oh, okay.
[12:06.62]I like doing it like that.
[12:08.00]I'm not doing a hint.
[12:09.62]So let's just go over this real quick.
[12:11.41]Explain, explain.
[12:12.17]Alright, I'll explain.
[12:12.85]Okay.
[12:15.87]Shit, I have to explain.
[12:16.75]Everybody relax.
[12:19.43]This is a relaxing stream.
[12:22.12]Okay, so Picross is a video puzzle, but you can do it on paper too.
[12:30.15]But so the first... My chin is real, I swear.
[12:38.29]Okay, so how you play Picross is... You see the numbers on the... I'm getting trolled.
[12:51.51]okay so this is the two there it is so what do we make how does this game work just go type in like how to pick oh I unlocked some artwork
[13:22.61]Oh my god, there's a lot of stuff here.
[13:27.07]Wait a minute, can't I already see it?
[13:34.04]Cool.
[13:34.80]There's a lot of levels.
[13:36.66]Alright, I'm down.
[13:39.80]Okay, I'm gonna- People are not gonna stop saying it, so I'm gonna explain it very quickly.
[13:44.21]Okay, let's do it very quickly, in under 30 seconds.
[13:46.73]If I go over 30 seconds, I'll turn the screen off.
[13:53.80]left and right are numbers which indicate how many cubes need to be filled in in that row or column for instance there has to be five filled in long ways here because the five at the top is how much needs to be there so we know it has to be all five because there's only five spaces by the way if you see a space between the numbers there has to be at least one cube of free space
[14:18.14]between these two numbers.
[14:19.80]So for instance, I'm not going to do it, but here and here, right?
[14:23.56]There has to be at least one space between these two numbers going down.
[14:27.66]There's your explanation.
[14:29.12]If you don't understand it, read a fucking book.
[14:40.17]It wasn't 35 seconds.
[14:42.49]We're relaxing today.
[14:48.64]It was the 32nd?
[14:51.73]Which book?
[14:52.25]I don't know.
[14:54.91]What was the last book you guys read?
[14:56.67]Okay.
[15:08.00]Well, we know it can't be.
[15:09.16]And by the way, this is very important.
[15:12.40]Two can't be over here.
[15:13.32]It has to be sequential.
[15:15.10]So this is the one.
[15:16.09]There has to be a space, which is here.
[15:17.59]So therefore, it's the two is here.
[15:21.31]That's how it works.
[15:24.97]You read the Bible the last book as you read.
[15:26.73]Okay.
[15:30.41]Alright.
[15:36.57]Alright, new artwork.
[15:37.25]What is it?
[15:37.57]I don't even... What are these pictures?
[15:39.65]I'm not even looking at the pictures.
[15:48.46]Okay.
[15:49.56]What's your favorite book?
[15:50.64]I actually haven't read a book in a long time.
[15:52.70]Bad.
[15:52.98]Although, I don't know.
[15:56.34]I've, um... I have read...
[16:00.62]I think the world has completely changed in a way.
[16:02.58]And what I mean by that is so there's a lot of information you can read online.
[16:12.16]There's a ton of articles and news programs, and there's a lot of reading that you do on a regular basis that's not out of a book.
[16:22.48]So you are still reading.
[16:26.29]You're not necessarily I'm not I don't mean I don't necessarily read
[16:29.99]like, novels anymore, right?
[16:31.61]Like, not really.
[16:32.13]Not that I can remember.
[16:32.97]But I do a lot of reading.
[16:39.48]What is that?
[16:42.76]Yeah, the 5x5s are always very easy.
[16:47.66]When can I unlock new songs?
[16:52.79]Reddit doesn't count no I'm not look I'm just saying that you do read a lot on a daily basis it doesn't not necessarily a novel but you are reading a lot okay how many uh oh there's a whole level one level two what else is here in level alright so we're gonna I'll get through these quick
[17:22.23]Can you lower the sound effects?
[17:23.35]Are they loud?
[17:29.15]Sounds too loud?
[17:29.81]Turn the music up and the sounds down?
[17:31.58]Is that what you want?
[17:32.04]Because I can do that.
[17:38.28]Better?
[17:42.68]Music's a little loud.
[17:44.85]Is that a little better?
[17:49.62]music still live is that better I think we're in a good spot right there's special puzzles too alright well let me get some money so we can make some uh unlock some stuff alright let's see so remember this is where it gets interesting because obviously one two three it could be there it could also be one two three therefore what have we deduced everybody if it has to be three going this way and there's only five spaces what type what have we deduced
[18:22.90]Nice work.
[18:25.08]And again, guys, what can we deduce from this row?
[18:29.18]It has to be a space in the middle.
[18:30.30]How can we deduce it?
[18:33.00]What do you think?
[18:33.90]I mean, how to deduce this for me?
[18:40.27]One, space, then three.
[18:41.93]You get it now.
[18:42.79]You guys get it.
[18:45.61]By the way, Picross is probably one of the most relaxing, fun games I've ever played.
[18:50.34]There are a hundred million versions of what you are seeing on the screen.
[18:55.30]It's on every app store.
[18:57.06]It's on every single device.
[18:58.90]You can find it.
[18:59.50]It's a lot.
[19:01.18]So if you like this, you go, oh, wow, this is cool.
[19:02.92]I wish I had like a hundred billion puzzles to do.
[19:04.92]They exist.
[19:07.54]Alright.
[19:07.97]So what have we deduced here?
[19:09.86]Here's what we've deduced here.
[19:11.68]I actually want to do that.
[19:13.47]Because this is physically not possible if we know these two are here.
[19:16.71]And this is a three in this down and up and down.
[19:22.01]It cannot possibly be here.
[19:24.20]You guys get it?
[19:24.64]You understand?
[19:26.58]No one's too dumb.
[19:27.42]No one's dumb enough to not know this.
[19:40.76]Okay.
[19:44.41]That was a pretty good deduction right there.
[19:45.71]Alright, so this is three.
[19:50.23]And here it is.
[19:54.77]What the deuce?
[19:55.69]Why did you just say that?
[19:57.45]Do you guys want me to look at every picture that comes up?
[20:02.81]Or should we just wait and just go through the gallery later?
[20:12.64]Please, God, no.
[20:17.02]I think you're the only person that said that.
[20:23.40]There were... Okay, this chat was pretty fast, right?
[20:27.50]It's hard sometimes to pick up what everybody's saying.
[20:30.16]But that was, I think, three no's.
[20:33.19]And every single other person said yes.
[20:36.28]I kind of feel bad for the people that said no.
[20:39.22]It's like, shit.
[20:41.40]There's like 96% majority that said they want to see this.
[20:44.03]Okay, cool.
[20:53.51]Go.
[20:54.93]I feel bad for them having no taste.
[20:58.04]Well, I mean... Come on.
[21:04.09]This one's going to be a quick one.
[21:06.07]That's a world record, I think, for that puzzle.
[21:08.87]That might be the world record.
[21:09.87]Because I might be one of... I don't know how many people played that level and went that fast.
[21:14.38]I'm probably in the top 20.
[21:23.30]I love these mini cans.
[21:25.79]What is it?
[21:37.42]Pog, pog, pog.
[21:40.81]You guys like this character?
[21:44.99]Oh.
[21:48.06]The little cans are great because...
[21:51.48]So, I don't like drinking an entire huge soda.
[21:55.08]Unless, I don't know why this is the way this is, but let's go over this.
[21:58.95]Oh, it just got absolutely real, by the way.
[22:01.69]This is now for real.
[22:04.13]Those were little warm-up rounds, but now is where you have to really start to pay attention.
[22:08.37]Some of these pit cross games can get to be 25, 20 by 20, 50 by 50 sometimes.
[22:11.36]But they get kind of crazy.
[22:19.08]But anyway, so look at this.
[22:20.58]Look at how difficult this is.
[22:21.52]So there's a two down here, but where the heck would that be?
[22:25.51]Oh, with a little bit of deduction.
[22:28.81]How many?
[22:29.03]What is it?
[22:29.29]What is it?
[22:29.83]10 by 10?
[22:30.81]So this is 10 by 10.
[22:32.53]So take a look at this.
[22:33.67]This is very interesting.
[22:34.67]This stream is so funny.
[22:35.53]It's like you're showing your grand... What are you saying?
[22:37.90]Like you're showing your grandkids anime that you don't understand.
[22:40.32]Reduce this.
[22:45.66]Wait, I'm showing my grandkids anime that I don't understand.
[22:49.69]What does that mean?
[22:51.65]I understand half of this because it's Picross.
[22:54.83]So I can tell you about the Picross part.
[22:56.41]I can't tell you about all the Miku characters.
[23:04.54]Dude, okay.
[23:06.78]My grandmother one time.
[23:09.20]My grandmother.
[23:11.54]She bought a hat one time.
[23:16.00]and she bought this hat and she wore this hat all the time.
[23:20.10]It was kind of one of those hats that's a flip hat where it's got all the way around.
[23:23.58]It was like, not a beanie, but it has like a brim on it.
[23:27.48]So she wore this hat all the time and
[23:31.52]She didn't know what was on it.
[23:33.22]She didn't know what was on the hat.
[23:35.69]And what was on the front as a graphic... A bucket hat, yeah.
[23:41.07]So, on the front of this hat was a graphic of the four South Park kids.
[23:46.60]She had no idea what they were.
[23:48.52]She thought they were just, oh, four cute, young, cute boys.
[23:52.36]Like, she just thought it was like kids.
[23:54.56]She did not know that they were the South Park kids.
[23:57.46]So...
[23:59.73]That was kind of endearing.
[24:02.49]And I feel like, am I doing that right now?
[24:10.54]And it'd be like, oh, grandma, you know, that's from a TV show.
[24:13.80]Oh, the TV show with the four young cute, the young boys.
[24:17.14]Yes, of course, I know that one.
[24:18.20]Yeah, it was, and she wore it all the time.
[24:30.20]Like she saw them as like little grandkids, not as kind of crass television.
[24:36.46]Okay, so here's what happened.
[24:37.40]Let's deduce it.
[24:39.58]So what we've done here, you're probably wondering, Jerma, I mean, you're so smart and everything you say is so intelligent.
[24:46.13]Help me, I'm having trouble.
[24:48.09]So we filled in almost the whole bottom row.
[24:50.79]What can we do now?
[24:51.59]We now let this see the two and the seven at the top.
[24:55.25]This is guaranteed to be the seventh.
[24:58.13]So all we have to do, I love when this happens.
[25:00.26]It's so much fun.
[25:01.14]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[25:04.22]And look what we've done over here.
[25:07.34]We have deduced so much.
[25:10.12]Stop explaining, I beg you.
[25:13.40]Your brain, your monkey brain takes too long.
[25:17.20]That's not, you're not chilling out, man.
[25:19.81]Shut up.
[25:20.53]Shut up.
[25:20.95]You're an idiot.
[25:21.86]This is not... I don't see anybody chillin' here.
[25:23.46]I see people being rude.
[25:25.46]This is supposed to be a chillin' out time.
[25:26.60]Alright, so let's go.
[25:35.49]Remember that... Okay, no more explaining.
[25:43.32]Actually, that sound kinda is annoying, isn't it?
[25:46.99]Yes, that's the hat.
[25:48.13]Somebody in substreams put it up.
[25:49.68]That's the hat.
[25:52.30]It's in substream right now.
[25:53.38]That is the exact hat that my grandmother wore for years.
[25:56.52]Uh, yeah, okay.
[26:00.44]I'm gonna turn this sound.
[26:01.20]I'm gonna turn the sound off.
[26:02.00]I don't like it.
[26:05.30]After this one.
[26:05.74]Alright, so let's keep going.
[26:08.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:09.74]Two, yeah.
[26:15.25]Cool that it fills that in automatically a lot of these games don't do that Perfect chill time.
[26:22.79]I actually don't you have please explain Why are you treating so why are you treating this like Citizen Kane I
[26:39.50]trying to figure out what that what that person means I'm treating this somebody said I'm treating this little sudoku puzzle like citizen kane what does that mean I just don't I just don't understand
[27:16.29]now here's the tricky part so this is gonna go this way that way oh you know where that goes this is part of the five that's the one plane pick across alongside you oh let's see one two space one two three four five yeah there it is
[27:46.77]So what is this picture?
[27:50.59]A dove.
[27:53.11]Oh, we got some artwork.
[27:56.61]I didn't even talk about the little cans.
[27:57.81]Okay.
[28:00.33]So the little cans are the perfect size.
[28:04.47]How many ounces is it?
[28:07.95]Let's see.
[28:09.83]Seven and a half ounces.
[28:10.61]So it's almost eight ounces.
[28:13.62]You get a big thing of ice and you can just keep pouring this in and just pretend like you're drinking a full can of soda.
[28:25.73]It's easy to hold.
[28:26.55]I like it small.
[28:35.03]I think I'll be able to clear this whole first and second page in the next like 20 minutes.
[28:38.47]Alright, this time I'm not going to say anything.
[28:41.66]It's up to you to deduce this because I'm just going to do it without your help.
[28:46.54]I might need it eventually, but whatever.
[29:48.76]I think I can get this.
[29:49.28]I think I can get it.
[29:57.95]Okay, let's just assume this is the first one, which it is, because it's telling me.
[30:00.87]So that's one.
[30:01.49]Let's say the other one is right here next to it.
[30:04.61]That means... I think this is what that means.
[30:08.25]And that is exactly what it means.
[30:11.13]Okay.
[30:14.75]That's the third...
[30:17.48]Is this the second?
[30:18.68]So this is the second one.
[30:19.98]That means this has to be here.
[30:22.46]The other one is right here.
[30:26.84]What else is that helping with?
[30:35.48]One, four, one.
[30:37.10]That's one.
[30:42.08]And then there's three.
[30:46.06]So this game actually helps a lot because what's, you notice what's happening.
[30:51.08]A lot of the, uh, a lot of Picross games don't do this.
[30:55.18]It won't, see on the left here, uh, next down over here, see down here.
[30:59.30]That one being grayed out is telling me this is that one.
[31:02.80]A lot of them don't do that.
[31:04.18]So this actually is a lot easier than a lot of typical Picross games.
[31:10.03]So that's, that's cool.
[31:11.85]So I know that this is the first one.
[31:13.85]That means that these, nothing else can be over here.
[31:18.61]So now, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[31:21.05]Wait, hold on.
[31:21.83]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[31:22.23]Okay.
[31:22.57]Okay.
[31:32.09]Now, I don't know if this is part of the 2 or part of the 4.
[31:34.83]I don't know that yet.
[31:37.19]My cousin could beat your ass.
[31:38.47]Alright, well, that's fine.
[31:39.39]Uh...
[31:49.04]What do you mean true?
[31:52.78]True.
[31:56.08]So this is the one, so that's really good to know.
[32:15.07]Comfy?
[32:15.53]Yeah, good.
[32:22.20]This guy's wicked handsome.
[32:24.40]Thanks.
[32:28.83]Okay, uh, I'm being distracted.
[32:31.45]So this is three.
[32:32.55]This is the one and there's two.
[32:41.39]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:44.95]That's one.
[32:47.51]That's two.
[32:49.84]Very nice.
[32:54.77]It's almost there.
[32:55.91]Nice.
[33:11.14]Wait, what'd you say?
[33:11.76]Somebody said something here.
[33:14.41]This is important.
[33:15.99]What'd you say?
[33:17.21]You asked?
[33:18.13]We talked about this.
[33:22.67]What the hell did you just write?
[33:23.78]It was about how you... Okay.
[33:25.34]I asked an NPC in a dream for an invention idea, and she said something to me, but I forgot.
[33:32.44]I'm telling you, you have to be... Make sure you get up and write it down.
[33:37.12]Something about your dream.
[33:38.37]Let's go over it one more time very briefly.
[33:40.73]If you were in a dream, have you ever noticed that when you're in a dream... Oh, Christmas tree.
[33:46.39]When you're in a dream...
[33:48.54]People if you if you ask certain people in your dreams about stuff, it will give you such unbelievable Oh my god, I completely forgot about this.
[33:55.46]Let me read this Okay, so I was a little high This is this is out of absolutely nowhere, but I'm gonna read this So I was kind of high And I wrote something that I think is unbelievably profound I I remember just being like high sitting on the couch and going
[34:18.72]I have to write this now.
[34:20.51]So I wrote this down.
[34:21.97]This is, I was a little bit high and I wrote this and I think it's incredibly profound.
[34:27.08]So let me read it to you.
[34:29.70]And this, you might think this is coming out of nowhere, but it's, it just kind of popped in my head.
[34:34.61]Like, oh, like when you, when you ever watch, like, for instance, like some of the old videos that I have, you know, back in like the TF2 era or back in whatever era, you know, if you've ever seen like an old picture of you or something, you're like, wow, look at that person.
[34:46.74]Here it is.
[34:47.02]And this is about the preservation of audio and video.
[34:53.30]Preservation of audio and video.
[34:54.52]Okay.
[34:55.74]And photos.
[34:59.62]I haven't read this in a while, so it's been like a week or so.
[35:04.21]So I don't know how fucking stupid this might be, but I'm just gonna go for it.
[35:06.97]I feel like I'm about to give a class presentation.
[35:13.66]I have to get the Miku sound out of my ear.
[35:19.86]Okay.
[35:22.76]Preserving video and audio is slightly uncomfortable because it's like time traveling to confront or combat your past self.
[35:31.24]Needing to revisit almost a different person who no longer exists.
[35:35.58]You aren't the you from before and you can feel it.
[35:39.43]Your memories almost clash into each other when you think or see back, almost like two different people's feelings agreeing and disagreeing at the same time.
[35:48.26]You are the same, but that person doesn't exist.
[35:51.56]It only exists because it lives in your brain.
[35:54.48]That person will never exist again.
[35:56.46]It's only a fleeting part of your mind.
[35:59.41]And your accounts are all you have.
[36:02.81]Memories turn into well-acted plays that you yourself start becoming the audience for.
[36:16.00]What about that?
[36:16.64]Did I read all the live tweeting of Poopy Halloween I did?
[36:30.69]Vsauce made that video already?
[36:32.26]Oh, whatever.
[36:38.94]Alright.
[36:41.12]Let me see.
[36:43.83]Oh, this, I also wrote this really high and this is wicked funny.
[36:46.45]Alright, ready?
[36:46.87]I wrote this, I always try to keep track of things I'm saying.
[36:50.15]So when I was high, this is like a few weeks ago, I had another, I had a million dollar idea and you guys are gonna laugh, but I don't, maybe you're not.
[36:57.00]Million dollar idea.
[36:59.56]Fruit sweatshirts slash hoodies slash merch line with solid colors and matching fruit patch of same color.
[37:09.40]Banana slash bright yellow, strawberry slash bright red.
[37:14.10]It's like, wow, that sounds fucking actually pretty sick.
[37:27.61]Okay, what else we got?
[37:30.83]We got all the Hubby Halloween stuff.
[37:34.05]Okay, so yeah, let me go over this.
[37:36.57]I've watched Hubby Halloween, the Adam Sandler movie.
[37:42.25]And let me go over it.
[37:43.39]I live tweeted the whole thing, but I never, I never tweeted it.
[37:47.07]Do you want me to do the whole thing?
[37:49.05]Do you want me to do the whole thing?
[37:53.90]It's like, it's like two pages.
[37:55.72]Okay.
[37:59.10]Okay.
[38:00.52]Let's start.
[38:01.80]So, um,
[38:12.95]Let's start.
[38:13.97]So this is the entire Hubie Halloween movie from start to finish.
[38:19.01]I wrote just my thoughts on it as the movie went on.
[38:24.20]Mute the music?
[38:25.84]Okay.
[38:28.80]I'm watching Hubie Halloween.
[38:31.48]I don't know what this movie is about or who the fuck this guy is.
[38:35.34]It's been 40 minutes.
[38:37.86]Why is he walking around a high school dance?
[38:40.00]Why is this guy in the movie?
[38:43.48]Why are they all so fucking mean to this guy?
[38:45.74]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[38:48.68]He has a magic superhero thermos.
[38:51.60]He can throw it like Captain America's shield.
[38:54.34]It can turn into anything.
[38:56.20]Literally any object he needs in that current scene.
[38:59.48]Is he a superhero?
[39:02.50]It just made him food.
[39:04.44]I think that's what was implied.
[39:06.72]He poured a bunch of food into it.
[39:09.12]And it made a smoothie.
[39:11.92]Okay.
[39:13.72]And then that's when I stopped doing draft tweets and I went to my notes.
[39:24.68]Okay, and then it goes here.
[39:27.40]Okay, here we go.
[39:29.21]Wait, why are they on a scary road now?
[39:32.31]Someone just threw a trash can at him while he was on his bike.
[39:35.87]They are trying to kill him.
[39:37.61]People are trying to fucking kill this guy.
[39:41.99]This is major spoilers, by the way.
[39:44.56]Why do we care that Walter is a werewolf?
[39:47.68]Who is Walter?
[39:49.18]Who is this other guy?
[39:52.84]There are missing kids?
[39:55.22]Wait, where was Hubie last seen?
[39:57.82]I don't remember.
[39:59.42]Were these kids with him?
[40:01.50]He's not related to these people and he's shitting in their house.
[40:05.19]He didn't wipe his ass and he waddled off the toilet.
[40:10.28]A dog just ate his own shit on camera.
[40:13.54]I'm serious.
[40:14.36]That's what I just watched.
[40:17.25]The dog is evil?
[40:19.19]Or was that the Walter guy?
[40:23.13]What was the grenade?
[40:25.18]He doesn't know he's in a haunted house and macing people.
[40:34.02]Who is Paul Blart's character a parody of?
[40:36.86]It seems like they want to tell you so bad.
[40:39.35]It's really heavy-handed and I don't know.
[40:44.79]They are pissing their clothes and they got caught.
[40:47.43]The werewolf?
[40:48.79]And the other guy, they're peeing their pants on a bench.
[40:54.04]The world's going crazy now.
[40:56.70]People are throwing rocks at him.
[40:59.00]Shaq is now the narrator of the movie, but it's someone dubbing Shaq's voice.
[41:05.30]Shaq is now a major character in the movie.
[41:08.12]His wife's voice is dubbed too.
[41:14.31]The police are doing a sting operation with Hubie.
[41:17.91]They're trying to catch his high school crush.
[41:21.47]The school crush is a demon?
[41:23.92]They loved each other all along.
[41:25.52]The killer is in the house.
[41:32.77]Spoilers, by the way.
[41:33.51]I'm serious.
[41:35.29]Mom is the killer?
[41:37.41]Are they all outside?
[41:38.75]They're all out.
[41:39.35]No one is dead.
[41:40.83]She's pouring gasoline on them.
[41:42.31]Just take the gas can away.
[41:43.73]What the fuck?
[41:44.21]She's like 90.
[41:44.84]It's... Just get it.
[41:47.02]He's contemplating letting them burn.
[41:49.68]They were apparently bullies?
[41:50.90]This whole scene was on TV?
[41:55.62]Everyone just laughed and said there is no reason at all to dislike him.
[41:58.96]They're laughing about it.
[42:00.94]The whole cast is saying sorry.
[42:03.06]No one's hurt.
[42:04.20]And what about the werewolf?
[42:07.44]Why were they trying to hurt him?
[42:09.53]Like trying to hurt him, it was just no reason.
[42:13.43]Mom is explaining how to be nicer to people and disappeared into the woods?
[42:20.19]All these guys watch is Hubie.
[42:22.56]Is this a joke?
[42:23.20]She's acting like it's a prank.
[42:25.64]He makes gadgets.
[42:26.52]Like, I don't get it.
[42:27.12]He had super powers from Salem?
[42:33.55]It is now a screaming compilation at the end.
[42:36.63]Ha ha ha ha, dude, I'm dying.
[42:38.77]It's like I'm watching a YouTube compilation of Sandler screaming.
[42:46.94]That's all I wrote.
[42:51.50]That movie was crazy.
[42:59.67]That movie was out of control.
[43:01.17]I remember as I was watching it, I was like, I don't... I was also a little high.
[43:06.34]I think you're noticing a theme here.
[43:13.74]Honestly, if you watch Whoopi Halloween, you're going to sit there and be like, what is going on here?
[43:21.70]What is happening right now?
[43:26.90]You were not a little high.
[43:30.17]The movie's just, it's just crazy.
[43:32.09]It's just crazy stuff happening.
[43:45.58]The sound effects volume, I'm sorry.
[43:54.06]Imagine if just the TV was turned off.
[43:55.76]No, no, I'm telling you.
[43:56.52]If you go back and watch Whoopi Halloween, you're just simply going to go, wait, all the stuff he said happens in this movie.
[44:06.71]There's a part, I'm not even kidding, there's a part where a dog is just eating his own shit.
[44:10.33]And it's like, what's going on?
[44:13.03]Why is this dog doing this?
[44:14.77]It was just like, what's happening?
[44:23.19]It was alright.
[44:26.88]I did watch it.
[44:27.52]I wasn't high.
[44:28.22]Everybody relax.
[44:39.79]Turn the sound effects down.
[44:49.69]Was it a dream journal?
[44:50.73]No, I just, I was kind of high and I was like, it was like Halloween time.
[44:55.13]Like, oh, let me put it on.
[45:00.83]Is that better?
[45:01.27]Just having no sound?
[45:02.75]Let's see.
[45:08.45]It might be better.
[45:08.95]Is that your zonked journal?
[45:14.04]Yeah, it kind of is.
[45:14.90]There you go.
[45:17.54]There's like the last few times I've been a little high.
[45:21.90]And I just write stuff down.
[45:23.06]And I just wrote down like a whole Vsauce video.
[45:25.38]Well, I thought I was being so profound.
[45:27.04]I remember sitting there looking at that and just being like,
[45:32.36]This is like, potentially like Nobel Prize winning shit.
[45:35.18]Turned out it was just a Vsauce video.
[45:44.94]Okay, this one's gonna be hard.
[45:45.92]What should I do first here?
[45:54.14]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[45:54.34]4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[45:54.58]Huh.
[46:02.37]5, 6, 7, 8.
[46:03.21]What can I start with?
[46:08.79]Maybe the 5.
[46:09.29]Let's see.
[46:12.03]3, 4, 5.
[46:12.25]Space 1, 2.
[46:15.56]Really?
[46:15.92]What can I deduce here?
[46:16.70]4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[46:17.88]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9?
[46:18.14]Let's see.
[46:19.00]If it was like this...
[46:32.48]If it was like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, that would mean that this would have to be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[46:39.61]1, 2, 3, 4.
[46:41.25]1, 2, 3, 4.
[46:42.83]So it has to be here, one of these.
[46:45.11]1, 2, 3, 4.
[46:47.65]1, 2, 3, 4.
[46:51.72]So by deduction, it has to be these two, and it is.
[46:55.08]That doesn't help, though.
[47:04.32]chess level gameplay.
[47:05.72]We're just chilling out today.
[47:07.86]And I read you some more drafts.
[47:09.22]There, aren't you happy?
[47:20.19]Let me see.
[47:20.57]I'm going to go for it.
[47:22.89]It was wrong.
[47:24.07]It was wrong.
[47:24.59]Reset it.
[47:24.85]Okay.
[47:29.66]It's okay.
[47:30.04]I got it now.
[47:33.92]This does help a lot because now this is the one.
[47:36.08]This is five, so right, if we give a count, one, two, three, four, five.
[47:43.07]Boink.
[47:44.29]One, two, three, four, five.
[47:45.37]Cheated.
[47:46.87]That's not cheating.
[47:50.67]That's just deducing by failure.
[47:53.76]I learned from my failure.
[47:58.68]Can't hide the fact that you tore your pants like a barbarian because you were too lazy to stand up.
[48:02.29]No, I didn't want to stand up because I... There's no reason for me to tell you why.
[48:07.75]I just didn't stand up because I felt like it.
[48:09.21]That's it.
[48:09.47]Okay, three.
[48:22.60]Well, it can't be here.
[48:24.56]Oh!
[48:25.02]Look what I just did.
[48:27.68]Now it opens up.
[48:32.34]that alright so this is probably two buttons all ones though it's annoying one two three four space one let's just assume that we can't assume
[48:54.00]Maybe we can.
[48:54.78]One, two, three, four.
[48:56.56]One, two, three.
[48:57.36]No, we can.
[48:58.60]So that means that it has to be one, two.
[49:00.46]It has to be here and here.
[49:04.49]So we can do that.
[49:05.37]That's correct.
[49:05.81]This is also a one.
[49:07.31]That's the first one.
[49:09.03]So there you go.
[49:09.79]And there's another one here.
[49:12.77]So that's four.
[49:13.99]That's one, two, three, four.
[49:18.20]Decide that.
[49:20.08]Is everyone relaxing?
[49:21.44]Somebody said this game sucks.
[49:22.38]I want them banned for at least one full minute.
[49:29.48]It's always hard when you have very small numbers with large gaps.
[49:33.22]Because this is the one.
[49:34.98]At some point from here to here is another one.
[49:38.50]And it's just hard to know where it is.
[49:40.94]I'll get it though.
[49:43.06]Alright, so I think I can do this though now.
[49:44.10]So this is two.
[49:45.60]One, two, three.
[49:46.63]Face one.
[49:47.19]Got it.
[49:49.38]Very cool.
[49:50.50]This is the part of the three.
[49:51.88]One, two, three.
[49:53.60]Can't be here.
[49:54.14]This is one.
[50:03.43]That's very helpful.
[50:09.41]This is part of the four.
[50:10.61]One, two, three, four.
[50:13.35]Very nice.
[50:14.85]You're never going to win this game.
[50:15.93]I guarantee you I do.
[50:18.33]I would bet... I bet you I complete this level.
[50:21.58]I bet you $100 trillion that I will complete... I will beat this level.
[50:27.22]There's no time limit.
[50:28.56]I will just... This level will... This level right here that you're seeing on the screen right now, I will finish it.
[50:34.06]It'll do the thing and it'll give us whatever the thing that... I'm going to finish it, so don't worry.
[50:38.83]It's literally impossible for me to not finish this exact level right here.
[50:42.45]Nobody's gonna...
[50:43.59]Nobody's going to like, you know, monkey paw me, right?
[50:45.75]It's like, this is what I'm telling you.
[50:46.73]I'm telling you it's $100 trillion that I will beat this exact screen right here.
[50:52.10]I will beat this.
[50:52.94]This level right now.
[50:54.06]Level 1-008.
[50:55.10]And there's no time limit.
[51:25.39]Part of the three.
[51:26.77]This also might be the three.
[51:27.99]I think that's the four right here.
[51:28.93]What do you mean it's not over?
[51:40.32]No, it's not.
[51:41.22]What do you mean it's not?
[51:42.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:43.04]Stop.
[51:44.65]That, no you didn't!
[51:45.57]I didn't say I couldn't make any mistakes, I just said I was going to complete this level.
[51:49.66]I didn't say, and by the way, there were no mistakes allowed.
[51:52.26]When did I say that?
[51:53.06]That was not, but don't curl that monkey paw, it's not happening.
[51:56.52]Everyone, this is a chill stream.
[51:57.96]I never said, by the way, I'm not allowed to make a single purple X. No, I just said I'm going to complete the level.
[52:06.21]You can talk all the shit you want, that's not the case.
[52:20.58]I like this music.
[52:25.98]It's chill.
[52:29.80]I don't have anything in this roll.
[52:50.48]Well, it can't be here.
[52:51.12]It has to be here.
[53:00.66]All starts coming together now.
[53:40.21]There.
[53:41.86]What are you smoking?
[53:42.72]I'm not smoking anything.
[53:44.12]I'm drinking a can of Sprite.
[53:51.14]Big hands.
[53:55.71]Why can't I just drink like a normal person?
[54:02.75]Sprite.
[54:03.33]I like Sprite.
[54:06.86]Bright's very simple.
[54:08.36]It's just like a sweet, bubbly drink.
[54:17.59]This whole stream is going to be claimed, I think.
[54:19.55]Like, this whole stream is going to be muted.
[54:21.65]So, I'm glad you're here chilling out on Thanksgiving Day wind down.
[54:25.78]This entire stream is going to get muted.
[54:27.00]Just to let you know.
[54:30.79]Hey, but the thing is, though, you might not even need sound.
[54:33.01]Because if you just watch me play the game, you just see kind of my deductions and stuff.
[54:39.27]You can still enjoy it.
[54:39.91]Just put on your own soundtrack.
[54:47.67]I do like 7-Up.
[54:50.15]I like 7-Up more than Sprite in the flavor department.
[54:53.37]But... Sprite is a little lighter.
[54:58.27]Right?
[54:59.64]7-Up, I think, is better tasting than Sprite, but Sprite is lighter.
[55:04.30]So if you want just a lighter drink, you know, that's what I'd choose.
[55:08.86]That one was simple.
[55:09.56]Now this is going to be really, really good for us.
[55:13.88]Very nice.
[55:19.53]It's always great when you get this fill in here.
[55:23.77]This is so good.
[55:37.79]a tier list about this already but but miku I don't I only know like four songs three songs from miku alright so let's go oh this is easy this is eight okay this one whoa this one was easy
[56:07.91]Just got to get one.
[56:09.59]Everything is just connected.
[56:10.45]Everything's connected.
[56:13.29]This one was very easy.
[56:15.71]Necktie.
[56:16.19]We have to check out every single picture.
[56:18.95]That's what was voted on.
[56:23.77]Show to tier list.
[56:24.57]I did every one of those already.
[56:27.49]Show to tier list, please.
[56:29.19]I already did it already.
[56:34.19]You guys want reruns?
[56:36.30]You want me to do reruns?
[56:39.49]Well, maybe my tastes have changed.
[56:40.69]That's true.
[56:44.57]Unlock some songs.
[56:45.43]Alright.
[56:47.77]Where do I go for that?
[56:49.45]Alright, so... Set your favorite characters.
[56:52.39]Ooh, wait a minute.
[56:58.92]Ooh, these are the characters.
[57:01.68]What character should I be?
[57:07.36]Everyone was saying this character.
[57:17.59]Luca.
[57:21.95]Okay.
[57:23.72]Puzzles on keyboard.
[57:25.78]How to play credits sound.
[57:27.92]Alright.
[57:29.10]How do I unlock songs?
[57:33.12]Special music.
[57:34.30]Alright.
[57:34.58]Unlock new songs.
[57:35.74]How much money do I have?
[57:37.00]I have 26 cents.
[57:40.05]How much is this?
[57:46.23]How much does it cost to unlock?
[57:48.72]What song should I unlock?
[57:49.90]I don't know what songs are.
[57:54.48]Do you see anything you like?
[58:00.80]Where's, uh... Where's that?
[58:02.96]Is it here?
[58:17.68]It's called people.
[58:19.66]Oh, people.
[58:26.87]Is it here?
[58:32.13]That one.
[58:32.85]I mean, it's like a five second delay.
[58:34.93]Which one?
[58:45.10]I'm just going to do this one.
[59:03.53]Alright, how about 393150?
[59:12.82]Shuffle, okay.
[59:18.74]This one sounds pretty good.
[59:26.97]There's a butterfly on your shoulder.
[59:30.37]No, it's the chair.
[59:33.86]How about this one?
[59:51.33]I need more stars.
[59:52.53]Alright, we have it on shuffle.
[59:55.11]We got it on shuffle.
[60:03.09]I like this.
[60:04.09]This is relaxing.
[60:06.61]You're 42.
[60:07.32]No, I'm not close, but I'm not.
[60:10.62]I'm getting there.
[60:12.32]Wait, why is this playing?
[60:19.88]What?
[60:20.52]Reset it.
[60:22.12]It's 8.
[60:22.44]Oh, it's 8.
[60:22.78]I'm an idiot.
[60:30.53]I went too far down.
[60:32.67]Butterfly on your shoulder is the song name.
[60:35.34]Oh.
[60:37.88]Well, I looked over and I see this.
[60:39.49]I was like that.
[60:41.79]What is that?
[60:43.17]Oh, I really genuinely thought you meant that.
[60:46.08]Yes.
[60:59.45]This one should be another easy one.
[61:01.71]I think so.
[61:02.33]Yeah, it will be.
[61:02.89]Look at this.
[61:03.23]I love it.
[61:09.73]Perfect.
[61:12.93]I mean, I want to say it's right here.
[61:14.18]It kind of has to be.
[61:15.62]Cool.
[61:37.08]OK, so 4.
[61:38.11]Very cool.
[61:38.67]2, nice.
[61:41.15]4, nice.
[61:43.31]1, nice.
[61:45.41]3, done.
[61:47.95]This is also a 1, so it has to be here.
[61:54.74]It's also a 1, so it has to be here.
[61:57.18]This is the 6, so I mean, even if it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, it has to be there.
[62:07.90]And it has to be here.
[62:08.90]Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
[62:10.08]I pressed the button a little too much.
[62:13.66]That actually, that's fine.
[62:15.06]Okay.
[62:28.62]Nice.
[62:30.80]Can you cover yourself in oil?
[62:35.27]Just, like, all of... What are you... Tying that person up.
[62:39.67]Tying that person up for, like, five minutes.
[62:44.72]That person needs to be tied up for, like, five minutes at least.
[62:51.28]That minicam.
[62:51.90]I have to go into the settings?
[62:54.46]Alright, I'll do it right now.
[62:55.26]How you guys doing?
[62:57.55]You guys ever go to have, uh... I almost said Halloween.
[63:02.35]You guys have a good, uh... Thanksgiving?
[63:03.63]Thanksgiving?
[63:08.87]This is a chill stream, yeah it is.
[63:20.54]Oh, alright, so it's in here.
[63:23.28]Oh, okay, background music settings.
[63:27.42]Just have it be anything, right?
[63:28.36]If it's gonna shuffle, then... Oh, I have to set it.
[63:35.00]Um...
[63:37.54]Will it just shuffle?
[63:38.52]It's the only one through that I have.
[63:39.42]I was going to pick this one.
[63:54.57]I don't celebrate?
[63:56.13]Well, if you do, then you do.
[63:56.93]Is it at the bottom?
[64:01.20]How do I make it so it will... I don't know how to do it.
[64:05.84]I just picked one.
[64:06.36]Let's see what it is.
[64:17.35]Is it different?
[64:21.69]Oh, okay.
[64:23.83]Ooh!
[64:26.57]This is cool.
[64:32.41]I didn't mean to do that.
[64:34.11]I can't use the analog anymore.
[64:44.70]Six.
[64:51.52]Oh, this is juicy.
[64:52.46]Look at this.
[64:52.86]This is juicy.
[65:12.01]That's, look at how juicy that was.
[65:14.37]Not even done either.
[65:20.67]Oh my god, that was juicy.
[65:32.55]Can't be there.
[65:33.06]Gotta be here.
[65:35.30]Gotta be here.
[65:36.98]There.
[65:37.50]There.
[65:38.08]Wait, what?
[65:38.68]What?
[65:38.92]What happened?
[65:40.02]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[65:40.54]I went too fast.
[65:42.26]I should have known, because that was the two.
[65:44.30]I went too fast.
[65:44.92]That was juicy.
[65:48.72]It was juicy.
[65:51.19]What?
[65:52.57]Stop saying that.
[65:54.87]Why not?
[65:55.41]What do you mean stop saying juicy?
[66:01.69]What's wrong with everybody today?
[66:03.47]I can't say this was a juicy one?
[66:05.27]Why?
[66:12.35]You have 18,000 people watching you play Picross.
[66:23.20]Dude, come on.
[66:24.44]I feel like that's like insulting to me.
[66:27.02]Like, what?
[66:27.60]Is that for you?
[66:28.20]Is that an insult?
[66:32.50]Whoa, is that some kind of insult?
[66:34.96]What, you think I'm funny?
[66:36.24]What, I'm funny to you?
[66:37.14]Well, funny like how?
[66:38.78]Funny when I amuse you?
[66:40.14]Funny like a clown?
[66:41.02]No, tell me.
[66:41.60]I want to know what you fucking mean by that.
[66:44.36]I should say you say funny things.
[66:46.15]I say funny things, huh?
[66:53.63]What, like I amuse you?
[66:57.71]That is one of the best scenes.
[66:59.21]Like, that scene is crazy.
[67:11.50]Not a big deal.
[67:16.99]That's classic.
[67:17.69]That's a classic one.
[67:22.59]Hey, I think there's people here because it's in the title.
[67:25.64]How many people have eaten their Thanksgiving turkey?
[67:30.18]And they're on the couch just sitting there with their phone going like this.
[67:39.97]I didn't even press the button.
[67:43.46]Here's a quick tip for you if you want to know about Picross.
[67:45.68]If it's one large number, just count the amount it takes to get to whatever the cap here is, which is 10.
[67:53.98]And that's what's left on both sides.
[67:56.67]So let's say it's 7, you're going to leave 3 on both sides because 7 plus 3 is 10.
[68:00.63]So therefore the middle 4 will be filled in.
[68:02.27]That's an easy way to do it.
[68:04.09]And for all of you that are going to be playing it later this afternoon... What time is it?
[68:07.85]Whatever.
[68:25.08]with a tip.
[68:28.82]Play Professor Layton?
[68:29.80]No, I can't play that game.
[68:30.76]That game pisses me off.
[68:34.92]I actually get angry when I play that.
[68:36.97]It's just like all the... So many of those puzzles in Layton just get so... My brain just can't do it.
[68:49.35]I'd rather just play Picross.
[69:01.44]Again, leave four on both sides, because that has to be the middle ones, and therefore, look what we just did.
[69:10.28]Layton is pretty tough.
[69:11.02]It is, it is.
[69:12.10]It's fun.
[69:13.50]I get to a point in Layton where I get to the first ten puzzles, and then they get too hard where I go, I don't really care anymore.
[69:20.07]It was fun while it lasted.
[69:30.87]Oh, this is 8-1, okay.
[69:31.50]That would be... Okay.
[69:32.58]This is part of the 5.
[69:45.29]1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
[69:59.11]So then this is interesting.
[70:03.32]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[70:03.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[70:03.78]Can't quite put something here because I don't know, but I could actually.
[70:10.04]Yeah, I could.
[70:25.30]Please, the music.
[70:26.06]Jeremy, you are fucked up.
[70:27.80]What did I do?
[70:28.68]I want you to explain me what I did in the last 10 to 25 seconds.
[70:35.34]In the last 30 seconds, I did something so fucked up that you wrote that.
[70:38.58]But what did I do?
[70:40.28]All I've been saying is... Okay, so this one, two, three, four, five.
[70:43.59]Okay, there it is.
[70:45.57]And there's two.
[70:46.55]What did I do that was that screwed up right there?
[70:48.41]I want to know.
[70:49.75]Tell me.
[70:54.02]Oh, dude, you are so fucked up.
[70:58.74]And watch your language, by the way.
[71:00.06]Okay.
[71:17.31]That's the middle two, so can I go this way?
[71:23.70]I can, but I don't know that yet.
[71:30.14]This is obviously the two, but it could be either one of these spots.
[71:33.34]I don't know.
[71:37.21]Turn the music down.
[71:37.85]Do you understand that there are at least a half dozen Miku fans in here that would be very mad at me if I turned the music down?
[71:47.55]At least a half dozen.
[72:00.42]I feel like I'm missing something that I can do right now.
[72:03.48]Five?
[72:07.86]Yeah.
[72:09.00]Okay.
[72:09.77]Well, the one is here.
[72:10.51]Alright, that helped.
[72:13.69]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[72:15.23]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[72:19.85]Oh, there we go.
[72:21.55]Nice.
[72:21.87]That has to be over here.
[72:28.70]This is a 1, so it could be here.
[72:30.02]This is also a 2, so it could be here as well.
[72:38.48]Yeah, 2 in the top row is done.
[72:39.58]That's true.
[72:40.06]So then this 5.
[72:43.70]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[72:44.20]There it is.
[72:48.99]Okay, so that's not available.
[72:50.49]This is available.
[72:53.53]This is not 4.
[72:55.99]This is 4.
[73:01.01]And now this is part of the two.
[73:05.40]I think it's here, but I don't know that for sure yet, so I'm not going to do it.
[73:10.88]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[73:14.24]3, 4, 5, 6.
[73:15.01]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[73:15.95]Okay.
[73:23.25]What?
[73:24.29]How?
[73:26.70]What did I do wrong?
[73:27.62]Wait.
[73:32.13]Uh-oh.
[73:35.51]Oh, I mean, I marked it wrong.
[73:38.19]Shit.
[73:38.99]Oh, that's what happens when you deduce wrong.
[73:43.69]It's alright, I'm good.
[73:51.07]You scared Luca.
[73:52.39]What do you mean, I scared Luca?
[73:58.45]Oh.
[74:05.52]A headset.
[74:06.18]That's okay.
[74:06.78]That's cool.
[74:10.42]Dude, this guy deduces.
[74:11.64]Sorry, I have a full plate of spaghetti over here.
[74:30.43]So I changed it.
[74:30.91]What should I put the music to then?
[74:34.97]Because I have to set it for the puzzle background music.
[74:37.82]You guys have to pick one.
[74:41.78]Which one of these should be puzzle background music?
[74:45.68]These are instrumental, that's why.
[74:47.26]Okay.
[74:48.34]What about this one?
[74:52.43]These are all instrumental.
[74:56.41]Third one?
[74:58.67]May I?
[74:59.07]Okay, one, two.
[74:59.85]Yeah, we'll do this one.
[75:04.04]I don't know, you're the Miku expert.
[75:05.28]I'm not a Miku expert.
[75:09.02]Guys, I thought Miku was somebody actually singing until a year and a half ago.
[75:15.17]I don't know, I didn't know very much.
[75:16.39]I thought it was a Gorillaz scenario.
[75:25.33]That just shows how much I knew.
[75:31.39]Somebody said, it's not.
[75:32.36]No, it's not.
[75:33.18]It's a... It's a robot.
[75:35.96]It's a... She's a... What do they call them?
[75:40.42]Vocaloid?
[75:44.44]Yeah, she's a vocaloid.
[75:46.80]Yeah.
[75:49.98]It's that vocaloid technology.
[75:59.57]You happy with this one?
[76:13.23]Um, alright.
[76:14.83]He's more real than you.
[76:18.37]He's real to me with sad, or crying.
[76:29.32]I- I-
[76:34.71]I'm not being mean.
[76:37.16]I didn't do anything.
[76:39.06]Miku is a wonderful character.
[76:41.16]When did I say anything bad about Miku?
[76:43.02]Ever.
[76:43.20]Are you serious?
[76:44.68]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[77:06.25]Apology with tears.
[77:07.71]I didn't say anything.
[77:20.98]Hey, go make an open-faced turkey sandwich.
[77:25.30]You just made 18,000 people cry.
[77:30.32]I'm playing my game.
[77:31.02]Everybody chill out.
[77:33.02]It's Thanksgiving.
[77:35.77]1, 2, 3.
[77:35.91]Can't be any of these.
[77:37.58]I love when it does this.
[77:42.20]So this is, alright, so here we go.
[77:45.76]So that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 has to be in here.
[77:49.15]Is it that?
[77:49.57]Do I have it already?
[77:52.55]It's pretty close.
[77:57.90]Is this the 3 or the 2?
[78:03.22]This has to be the three, right?
[78:06.53]Why are you so mean?
[78:08.89]If I get this, then it's good to go.
[78:16.89]Why don't you say sorry to Miku?
[78:20.16]I'm sorry, Miku.
[78:20.92]There you go.
[78:21.38]Now tell me if I'm right.
[78:26.84]I think it's the... It's the three, yeah.
[78:31.46]Is it the two?
[78:32.74]Where were the three?
[78:33.48]No.
[78:33.98]Oh my god.
[78:45.05]Alright, so this is obviously part of the three.
[78:46.91]So this, I can do a lot of deduction here.
[78:57.55]One, two, three, basically one, you know?
[79:04.76]1, 2, 3, 4.
[79:06.28]1, 2, 3, 4.
[79:07.04]I don't know if that's correct or not.
[79:08.70]This is probably the sixth.
[79:16.85]I wanted to press the other button.
[79:21.59]Can you please do an ASMR stream?
[79:23.05]Yeah, sure.
[79:23.41]Let me just get a little bit more of my spaghetti.
[79:33.55]I wanted to press the other button.
[79:40.66]Why is it so wet?
[79:41.58]I put extra sauce on it.
[79:44.63]My spaghetti sits in at least two or three inches of sauce.
[79:49.93]And then when I'm done, I tip it up like this and I just drink it.
[80:05.73]Do you really think I'd do that?
[80:14.15]Be honest with yourself.
[80:16.71]Sit here and think.
[80:18.17]Close your eyes if you have to, and say... Does a person actually do that?
[80:22.23]No.
[80:24.03]No, there's no way.
[80:26.77]Glad we could figure this out together.
[80:32.99]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... Oh, I think I got it.
[80:37.38]This has to be there.
[80:38.04]That helps a lot.
[80:53.55]Cool.
[80:55.03]What are you talking about?
[80:56.05]I've got three X's.
[80:59.99]I'm trying to go too fast.
[81:03.93]I'm going to copy past.
[81:05.15]I'm not going to read about smelling me or something, whatever.
[81:07.43]Alright, so this is the two is right here.
[81:11.72]OK.
[81:11.78]We got to know.
[81:30.46]one one one four three there it is alright I got a lot of x's don't read it I think I get a new song
[81:55.68]I mean, the mods are just sniping it, so I really probably shouldn't read it.
[81:59.61]And I'm not going to read it.
[82:00.33]I'm just not going to read it, because it's weird.
[82:04.73]I need a new song.
[82:08.67]I need some help.
[82:09.07]I think I have enough.
[82:17.66]Is Particle Miracle any good?
[82:21.68]You're a weird guy.
[82:22.62]Read it.
[82:25.41]You could be kind of a weird guy and not be kind of a gross guy.
[82:28.95]Is this one good?
[82:44.05]What about coloring?
[82:45.35]I'll do this one.
[82:48.35]I already own this.
[82:49.61]What?
[82:52.07]I already, I have this one already.
[83:00.01]What about by your side?
[83:01.01]Oh, whatever.
[83:04.95]Why was that locked?
[83:05.69]I already have it.
[83:06.25]I actually like this one to be a puzzle background, I think.
[83:17.98]This one's kind of cool.
[83:32.95]I'll do this one.
[83:40.93]Yeah, I'll keep this one.
[83:43.31]These songs are really obscure.
[83:48.92]What a special.
[83:49.62]Complete one large artwork.
[83:53.80]Well, let's clear this whole thing first.
[84:00.78]They're very obscure, really?
[84:12.39]Whoops, I went a little too far, but it's fine.
[84:13.67]Is there another nine?
[84:17.88]Seven are here.
[84:21.54]Any of the big ones?
[84:22.50]Six.
[84:24.80]Another six.
[84:25.48]Remember, it has to be here because of absolute standard deduction.
[84:33.69]Any more big ones?
[84:34.49]Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[84:38.39]Now I can get that in a minute.
[84:39.79]Alright, let's go for it.
[85:01.64]What did I do wrong?
[85:02.18]I got it right.
[85:04.92]Stop.
[85:05.30]Stop.
[85:05.60]What?
[85:05.76]This is a pretty good popcorn stream.
[85:09.87]That's pretty cool.
[85:11.15]You made a fresh thing of popcorn?
[85:13.48]Cool.
[85:35.54]Fresh popcorn is the best.
[85:38.65]And nothing beats... You know what?
[85:41.95]I really do love just sort of carnival food.
[85:47.94]Popcorn, fresh pop.
[85:51.22]It's not much that's better.
[85:54.08]The stuff in the microwave is good.
[85:55.22]It's fine.
[85:56.48]But when you're at a fair and that machine is just baking, you watch the little pan bubble over and it's... It fills up.
[86:04.73]They get the big scooper.
[86:05.47]It's hot.
[86:10.63]You have a clown diet.
[86:13.20]I don't eat good.
[86:15.26]It's fun.
[86:15.90]It's good.
[86:17.09]I just don't eat it every day.
[86:20.11]I actually prefer bear slash carnival popcorn over movie theater popcorn.
[86:25.82]Movie theater popcorn is a little, it's a little weighed down for me.
[86:29.76]It's a little too oily and too much greasy in a way.
[86:32.78]It's like too much.
[86:35.04]The pop stuff at the carnival is light.
[86:37.88]It's nice and salty and hot.
[86:39.38]It's not as weighed down as movie theater butter tastes.
[86:50.66]Now that's not to say I don't like movie theater popcorn.
[86:52.92]I do.
[86:53.36]I love it.
[86:54.86]But I never eat it all.
[86:55.62]I always try to get a small and you just kind of like blah.
[86:58.89]Like just eating like a pad of butter.
[87:04.65]I don't like sweet popcorn.
[87:06.11]Not really.
[87:08.57]There are some things that I just do not like to be sweet.
[87:11.53]Popcorn is one of them.
[87:14.32]And I know that there's a lot of... It could be both, right?
[87:17.64]There's a lot of things like that.
[87:18.50]But I'm not into it.
[87:23.28]I've had, obviously, caramel popcorn before, and it's good, but I would not put it anywhere even close to regular popcorn.
[87:31.44]Is this the one or the two?
[87:33.34]This is probably the one.
[87:34.08]I'm going for it.
[87:34.54]I was wrong.
[87:37.24]Just a stupid move.
[87:54.45]actually gonna help what is it a choker gallery what about kettle corn um I don't think I've had like I don't know the real kettle corn is just sugary right
[88:24.27]It's just sweet, sugary.
[88:25.89]A little salty too, it's like both.
[88:37.36]Yeah, are we gonna probably move in- are these 15?
[88:38.72]Alright, there's a lot of 10x10s.
[88:40.68]When's the- when do you get to- Alright, actually I might be able to do most of these.
[88:44.48]I don't have a time limit for the stream, but... I just was gonna hang out for 53 hours or something.
[88:52.22]Whenever I'm just kinda done.
[88:54.83]I don't know.
[88:55.13]I like this idea of just kind of... I don't know.
[88:58.18]I want to try this thing where streams don't have to be like six, seven hours long.
[89:04.56]Like five, six, seven hours long.
[89:05.84]I can just do them whenever.
[89:09.31]Maybe they're shorter, but just do them whenever.
[89:11.07]No, I'm not leaving yet.
[89:21.06]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[89:22.30]Okay, so I can do this.
[89:27.37]That's very good.
[89:37.88]You made her sad.
[89:39.02]Apologize.
[89:39.76]Okay, this is poor.
[89:47.96]It can only be here.
[89:51.17]I'm going so fast.
[89:52.13]Look at how happy she is.
[90:26.91]That was pretty flawless.
[90:39.46]My mom loves Jerma.
[90:44.37]I hope your mom doesn't think I'm bad or anything.
[90:55.24]I didn't stay on this for very long.
[91:05.13]My mom is a fan of you.
[91:06.80]Really?
[91:07.14]My mom hates you.
[91:08.94]I have a feel- I don't know what the- Moms love him.
[91:19.13]Well, I will say this, if you have a relationship with your parents or your mother, where you can both enjoy the same thing, potentially enjoy the same media, that's actually pretty, that's pretty awesome.
[91:31.73]Um, that's really, really nice.
[91:33.88]That's sweet.
[91:34.72]It is.
[91:36.00]Uh, so that makes me kind of happy that you can kind of enjoy things as you know, together.
[91:40.42]That's pretty cool.
[91:48.19]Alright, seven, eight, nine.
[92:14.01]Alright, so... 6, 7... We can do a lot here.
[92:17.01]I don't want to get it wrong.
[92:17.73]This is poor.
[92:19.17]1, 2, 3, 4.
[92:19.25]1, 2, 3, 4.
[92:43.53]Well, here's your five.
[92:44.19]Five.
[92:59.34]Here's your two.
[93:02.48]Here's your four.
[93:03.66]Here comes your three.
[93:04.26]Here's your six.
[93:08.15]Here's your four.
[93:10.53]This is part of your three, obviously.
[93:11.83]This is part of your four.
[93:21.00]there's two very reptile eyes I'm a human dude when you just get in the zone on some of them it's so it's awesome feels so good
[94:12.74]You don't know that yet?
[94:20.93]Can you please do a Bernie Sanders impression?
[94:22.35]No.
[94:24.55]No, it's a chill day.
[94:25.87]Chillin' out.
[94:28.15]No human likes Picross this much.
[94:32.26]Can I ask you a question?
[94:36.28]On the Sunday paper, when you pick it up and you do the crossword every weekend,
[94:44.30]make you a weirdo the hundreds of millions of people that do crossword every week hold on a minute let me let me get this let me get this for your generation when you open up wordle every day still human you still human
[95:14.86]I got Picross that I play every, you know, every few weeks.
[95:17.30]Maybe I'll jump on and do a game.
[95:18.64]You do Wordle every day.
[95:21.78]Still human?
[95:27.08]People play, what is it, Sudoku?
[95:41.53]People play that all the time.
[95:45.32]Okay, everybody was giving me shit earlier for not reading, but this is very clearly a game of logic and reasoning and deduction and making your brain work.
[95:54.74]Why is this a bad thing?
[95:59.30]What, I'm not playing Call of Duty today?
[96:01.68]I'm not playing the FPS Call of Duty game?
[96:09.06]Therefore, what?
[96:11.98]No, we're deducting today.
[96:24.76]Alright, let me restart, because somebody called me a red-pilled Redditor, and I don't even, like, what is that even supposed to mean?
[96:31.29]Alright.
[96:33.23]We can do this?
[96:52.28]I don't know why that's doing it.
[96:53.30]That's just like making me laugh.
[96:54.50]I don't know why.
[96:58.68]Redfield Redditor.
[97:02.96]That sounds like such a shitty superhero name.
[97:16.57]Happy Turkey Day.
[97:17.17]Yeah, you too.
[97:24.00]With this X being here, I think I can do the left side, but I just, my brain's too small to do it.
[97:38.29]Uh, this is definitely the two.
[97:44.75]Okay.
[97:53.22]Can he stand up?
[98:06.85]No.
[98:09.13]No.
[98:09.77]I'm not going to stand up.
[98:18.81]No.
[98:19.23]Why?
[98:20.02]I'm not doing that.
[98:21.40]I've had this nightmare like five times.
[98:22.68]I'm not doing it.
[98:24.74]I've had this nightmare five times.
[98:26.64]I keep having this dream.
[98:27.61]I'm not doing it.
[98:28.47]I'm not standing up.
[98:45.51]What's your opinion on Dr. Pepper flavored baked beans?
[98:48.81]That's weird.
[98:49.31]I don't have an opinion on it.
[98:51.35]My first initial reaction is that's a little strange.
[98:55.93]Probably all I have for you, though.
[99:21.34]Is he actually naked or is he just hinting at it?
[99:23.54]No, I- okay.
[99:24.78]I'll- I'll stand off, whatever.
[99:26.50]I have pain- I'm just- I don't know, I've had this nightmare.
[99:31.86]The nightmare's happening.
[99:33.96]What if the nightmare happens?
[99:36.94]What if the nightmare actually happens?
[99:38.10]Hold on, I'm turning the camera off.
[99:45.90]No, this is a night- this is a nightmare.
[99:51.24]Alright, I'm standing up.
[99:52.00]I'm standing up!
[100:00.86]I'm up!
[100:01.08]I stood up!
[100:06.44]You're short.
[100:09.82]I didn't stand up all the way.
[100:10.86]Throw your pants.
[100:13.15]No!
[100:13.43]You don't need to see my pants.
[100:14.71]You just need to know that they exist.
[100:18.31]I'm burning time here.
[100:19.17]I could have done this in three minutes.
[100:23.82]Nice pit stand.
[100:27.74]Shut up.
[100:30.70]What's going on?
[100:38.12]I told you I just burned fuel.
[100:39.92]And I don't know, I just do.
[100:49.57]I feel like there's like two or three just little people in my body shoveling coal into a furnace.
[100:57.24]And that's like how I, that's how I function.
[100:59.92]There's just three little, like, like people just shoveling fucking coal into a furnace.
[101:04.74]And that's how I like, I operate.
[101:09.50]My body is like an old train from like the 1700s.
[101:24.60]I think it's right here, but it might not be.
[101:31.14]It is right there.
[101:35.46]What was this one?
[101:38.76]Do you heat your house up?
[101:41.61]It just gets so hot in here because this computer over here, obviously when you're streaming, so when this computer is live, and I'm live through the internet like I am right now,
[101:53.23]This thing has to, it's encoding every frame that you're seeing.
[101:58.57]And putting it out, essentially like uploading it to the server.
[102:01.35]It's encoding a shitload of data.
[102:04.56]So this computer's just sitting here, just calculating.
[102:07.72]And pumping out hot air.
[102:10.92]And I could like, yeah, I could get, I have like air conditioning and everything, but... And I'm telling you right now, I'm not gonna open a window.
[102:20.26]Dude, just open the window!
[102:24.32]Have my windows just wide open while I'm sitting here talking about like, oh yeah, I'm a red-pilled Redditor, and oh yeah, oh yeah, oh no, spaghetti.
[102:34.15]That would not go, I don't want that just broadcasted out to like the fucking neighbors.
[102:40.99]Are you serious?
[102:45.70]No, these windows stay closed.
[102:49.60]These windows stay very tightly closed.
[102:53.12]This is a whole house.
[103:03.17]You're broadcasting to 20,000 people.
[103:05.45]Yeah, those 20,000 people have chosen to be here.
[103:10.71]A random neighbor in like, I don't know, like an apartment complex or a house or a neighborhood.
[103:16.38]They didn't sign up to hear you talk about how you shit your pants today.
[103:20.48]They did not sign up for that.
[103:24.15]So I don't want all my windows to be open while I'm just like, oh!
[103:27.78]I'm just like, what the fuck is that guy doing?
[103:32.44]What is that guy doing?
[103:34.28]Why is he like this?
[103:35.60]That's why you... It's a chill stream.
[103:50.15]It is.
[103:50.51]It is a chill stream.
[103:58.20]17,000 people are already seeing you do that.
[104:00.06]I know, but you are here because you chose to be here.
[104:03.68]You clicked on my stream.
[104:05.99]You're not reading a book.
[104:08.37]You're not reading a book in your place just being like, oh, yeah, this is a really relaxing day.
[104:13.39]I'm going to put the window open today.
[104:15.63]That's nice out.
[104:18.27]No.
[104:18.45]No, guys.
[104:18.85]No.
[104:19.03]No, I don't want to show my dick on camera.
[104:24.42]No, no, no, no.
[104:25.00]I don't want to show my dick on camera.
[104:26.66]No.
[104:29.62]What the fuck is that person doing?
[104:32.56]Why are his windows open?
[104:33.52]Why is he screaming this stuff?
[104:36.29]His windows are open!
[104:37.31]He's yelling these random things!
[104:39.93]What could he possibly... What could you possibly be doing?
[104:47.05]Oh yeah, no, no, yeah, let me open up all my windows and just start, you know... No, no, no, yeah!
[104:52.84]Oh, yeah!
[104:54.30]How many baseballs can I fit in my ass?
[104:57.36]Oh, time that person out.
[104:58.28]Ban that person.
[104:59.54]Ban that person for a day.
[105:04.01]No.
[105:07.47]Not happening.
[105:14.52]This is a chill stream, everybody.
[105:15.50]Blah.
[105:29.62]The same reason if I ever, like, am singing... If I ever sing in the car, let's say I have music playing a little bit, or I'm, like, just sitting there, like, singing... If I was singing this song, those windows are up.
[105:40.64]There is no way I'm gonna pull up to a red light and be like... And I'm just like, whoa!
[105:48.23]That guy's singing!
[105:49.29]That guy's singing!
[105:50.25]That guy's singing!
[105:52.17]How is it any different?
[105:57.14]Can you tell me how that's different?
[105:59.53]I know for a fact a ton of people that do that, that all of a sudden, oh no, I'm going to pull up to the red light.
[106:05.79]It's like, I'm slowing down to the red light.
[106:10.56]It's green.
[106:21.24]Now we go back to what we were doing.
[106:23.72]Come on.
[106:25.04]You can't give me shit for this one.
[106:28.79]Don't even start with that.
[106:30.09]This guy's only filled in four squares in three minutes.
[106:50.65]Hey, how was your Thanksgiving?
[106:51.57]Was it good?
[106:55.82]Alright, now I'm going to focus and I'm going to get it done.
[106:57.28]Just relax.
[107:07.72]What can I fill in?
[107:11.94]3, 4, 5, 6, 7... Oh, I can do this, probably.
[107:13.78]Wait.
[107:15.16]One... Yeah.
[107:15.58]Alright, I'm focused now.
[107:18.89]Let's... Come on.
[107:25.41]Hmm.
[107:26.03]A lot of low numbers.
[107:30.35]Did I just... What?
[107:33.69]What am I doing?
[107:35.53]Right bumper did that.
[107:41.77]1 space 2.
[107:42.53]I don't want to guess.
[107:44.39]1, 2, 3, 4.
[107:46.80]1, 2, 3, 4.
[107:47.16]So it's like this.
[107:52.56]And OK.
[107:54.60]This is the 3.
[107:57.66]Yeah, OK, so here 1, 2, 3.
[108:12.64]Alright, so now that I know this, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[108:15.22]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[108:15.36]So there we go.
[108:15.74]This is the 1.
[108:16.18]Nice.
[108:16.38]2.
[108:16.40]That's 3.
[108:41.34]Is this an Animal Crossing song?
[108:43.30]What is... Hold on.
[108:44.46]What did you say?
[108:45.00]What is this Animal Crossing-ass song?
[108:49.45]It's... This is Miku.
[109:24.35]Alright, ban him for a minute.
[109:25.57]Ban him for a minute.
[109:26.25]Time him off for five minutes.
[109:32.28]I am really giggly today, you're right.
[109:39.72]Shit, I have to stop.
[109:40.80]Stop!
[109:41.38]I keep fucking up.
[109:42.96]I just imagine somebody coming to the stream and just... They've never heard anything like this before.
[109:48.73]Like, what would you honestly think?
[109:49.99]Like, I've never heard a Miku song.
[109:52.61]I have played Animal Crossing.
[109:54.33]That's what I have up here.
[109:55.81]That's what I know.
[109:58.93]Like, what is the song that I'm listening to?
[110:00.38]Ugh.
[110:15.14]Alright, I gotta get it together here.
[110:31.57]Miko and Animal Crossing fans are the same.
[110:36.61]They probably share a pretty big audience.
[110:38.85]They're both fun.
[110:39.41]They're both cool.
[111:02.44]I don't know yet.
[111:05.63]Here it is.
[111:06.01]Alright, that helps.
[111:13.67]Alright, so nothing else here, so this has to be there.
[111:25.51]What is it?
[111:28.98]Paper tags.
[111:31.54]Cool.
[111:35.04]New song?
[111:36.37]Alright.
[111:37.29]This is a fun game.
[111:40.19]Alright, I'm gonna do Particle Miracle.
[111:43.69]I regret my purchase.
[112:01.47]Hold on.
[112:07.45]Nevermind.
[112:08.27]Alright, this is going on the puzzle part.
[112:20.06]I thought, okay, people are like, what am I, what the fuck, what do you mean?
[112:23.37]I thought it was an instrumental and I didn't want to buy an instrumental.
[112:28.20]The song is fine.
[112:29.22]The song is good.
[112:30.18]I just thought it was an instrumental.
[112:43.27]How do I feel about visual novels?
[112:54.94]I don't think I've ever done one.
[113:01.40]What constitutes a visual novel?
[113:03.34]Have I done one before?
[113:19.08]Ace Attorney?
[113:19.60]I told you I can't play Ace Attorney.
[113:24.26]I physically cannot play the game.
[113:25.56]I can't.
[113:33.06]Why, why not?
[113:33.78]Alright, we gotta explain this to some, the newer audience.
[113:38.74]So, every, I wanna say, every, like, every, like, 10 seconds to 1 minute, the screen goes, and flashes a white flash in your face.
[113:54.94]Does this every 10 to 15 seconds.
[113:56.14]Can't go, can't go, can't go, can't go.
[114:01.16]And it's just like... And here's my head.
[114:04.60]And you can't turn it off.
[114:05.30]It's not true.
[114:17.25]It is true.
[114:18.51]You know how I know it's true?
[114:19.45]Because I bought the entire Ace Attorney remake when it came out.
[114:23.07]Because everyone was telling me I should be playing it.
[114:24.59]And I was so excited about it.
[114:25.60]And I went in.
[114:27.52]And it just did the... It still was doing it.
[114:35.25]Alright, I can get this here.
[114:42.97]I can do this one too, I think.
[114:45.67]Play romance games, please.
[114:48.61]You're balding more on your right side than your left.
[114:50.68]That's not true.
[114:52.00]What's happening with your being, what you're experiencing, I'll tell you.
[114:55.70]Here's what you are experiencing.
[114:56.82]You're experiencing...
[114:59.98]My hair, my hairline is here, right?
[115:02.72]Look, I just pulled it over.
[115:03.74]My hairline is right here, but my hairstyle is kind of, I have wavy hair.
[115:10.55]So my actual hairline is that, right?
[115:13.61]What you're just, what you're seeing is you're seeing how it falls on one side.
[115:16.79]So therefore you think I'm balding on one side, but not the other, but just my hair is wavy and goes like that.
[115:21.43]I also need a haircut.
[115:22.29]So like this mad scientist shit back here is, should be like that.
[115:27.61]And this should be a little shorter.
[115:31.52]Also, I've been fucking banned for one day.
[115:49.26]Oh, that does that.
[116:06.48]Ooh, this is... I like this part.
[116:10.38]This is a lot of the 3-2-3s.
[116:16.83]I just realized that.
[116:18.63]Here's your 8.
[116:19.19]Here's your 6.
[116:34.66]Again.
[116:36.74]Cool.
[116:38.22]You should grow it out.
[116:39.04]No.
[116:41.80]No.
[116:43.80]I like it like this.
[116:45.32]If it stays like this, it's fine.
[116:47.44]Having the, um... I'd say medium length hair.
[116:51.65]I need to... I gotta clean it up, though.
[116:53.65]It's a little sloppy.
[116:54.59]Been a while since I had a haircut.
[117:05.09]Oh, you can sort it by character.
[117:07.91]Can you?
[117:17.44]Please go back to the Hillary Clinton hair.
[117:30.12]That is never happening ever again.
[117:35.84]Alright, what should I buy now?
[117:37.60]What's this one?
[117:38.02]I need more.
[117:39.76]I think I have most of them all in shuffle, but I don't think it matters.
[117:46.18]I think the shuffle mode stuff, I think that's just in this menu.
[117:51.06]If I press play on this, it's gonna shuffle in this menu, not in the game.
[118:00.16]How come your chat is specifically like 10 seconds behind?
[118:02.81]I don't know, maybe it's your connection to me?
[118:07.28]I think that's how it works, right?
[118:10.48]Like, I'm West Coast, United States, so maybe if you're, I don't know, if you're connecting from, I'm putting it out, broadcasting to you in Europe or something, maybe it's a little behind?
[118:26.51]I don't know.
[118:28.77]Please, Popopo is in the list.
[118:31.21]Turn the music down.
[118:37.50]Can we get a poll?
[118:40.74]Should I turn the music down another notch?
[118:42.20]Turn the music down one more notch.
[118:46.94]Yes or no?
[118:50.89]Put a poll up while I figure this out.
[118:52.77]Somebody said PokePo is in the menu?
[118:54.63]Where is it?
[119:06.84]Somebody said it's in the menu.
[119:08.68]Where is it?
[119:12.20]No, it's not.
[119:12.66]Okay.
[119:12.98]I'm just being lied to.
[119:14.62]Just being lied to.
[119:16.44]Switch to Miku.
[119:22.51]I'm going to change character, yeah.
[119:23.59]I'm going to play the other character.
[119:32.72]I'm going to play as Aito.
[119:34.20]Aito.
[119:35.89]Aito?
[119:36.57]Eito?
[119:36.71]How do you say it?
[119:47.96]Please, I'm gonna puke.
[119:51.02]Dude, just- You're not gonna- Just drop the volume of the stream a little.
[119:54.76]I'm to- I'm at a very good volume.
[119:57.27]Yeah, you're- You just- Reduce the volume.
[120:10.84]I don't think you're gonna- I think you're gonna be okay.
[120:13.32]Just turn it down.
[120:14.22]Why are you blasting it?
[120:17.13]I wonder if it's this one or this one.
[120:39.43]314 is a given line, isn't it?
[120:40.73]Let's see.
[120:44.65]I think you're right.
[120:50.96]You are correct.
[120:56.30]Yes, you are.
[121:00.34]I'm not paying attention to the bottom.
[121:01.32]Well, I know it's that.
[121:25.54]We had a good Thanksgiving.
[121:26.20]Music down?
[121:31.82]No.
[121:32.14]Okay.
[121:33.40]I wonder if I can do the ones.
[121:49.83]Is this the four?
[121:51.58]Yes, it is.
[121:57.70]3, 2, 3, 2, cool.
[122:00.78]2, 2.
[122:01.16]I think that's gonna be it here, yeah.
[122:22.36]Can you please play the music on your violin?
[122:27.65]I owned a violin.
[122:30.47]Okay.
[122:35.79]Do I have enough stars to... I need to talk louder.
[122:40.27]No!
[122:40.63]Alright, I need a new song.
[122:47.91]How about this one?
[122:51.97]What?
[122:52.23]How do I not have stars?
[122:54.53]Okay, I'm going to bang out some levels really quickly here.
[123:07.63]No more chill.
[123:08.23]We want aggressive.
[123:10.41]That's just not going to happen right now.
[123:12.27]Let's try this one.
[123:32.47]Zero.
[123:40.01]Doesn't really matter because I'm going to get all the info I needed right here.
[123:51.84]That was easy.
[123:52.64]Or was it? 12341234.
[124:11.76]We can also put our own soundtrack on.
[124:15.24]How do you know the 4 and 5 are on their respective sides?
[124:19.07]That's actually a good question and I'm going to answer it.
[124:21.39]So on the left hand side of the screen you see the 4.
[124:24.35]It's 4 space 5.
[124:27.62]What that means is the 4 has to be on the left side.
[124:30.80]They have to be spaced that way.
[124:34.84]So if it's 4 space 5, the 4 has to be first.
[124:38.99]It can't be 5 and then 4.
[124:40.41]You read it left to right.
[124:43.07]So left to right, you have to put the squares in in sequence.
[124:51.81]So see, 2, 1, 1.
[124:52.77]It's not just like, oh, 2, 1, 1 is going to be randomly in here.
[124:55.97]The 2 has to be first, then a 1, and then a final 1.
[124:58.92]And you can see how that looks.
[125:00.18]There's a 2 here.
[125:00.84]There's a lot of space.
[125:02.12]The space doesn't matter.
[125:04.36]It could be one space or it could be 10 spaces.
[125:07.02]There just has to be one square in the middle.
[125:09.58]It has to be.
[125:22.21]Kind of stuck.
[125:22.65]No, I'm not.
[125:30.12]One, two, three, four, five.
[125:31.42]Alright, reducing.
[125:38.24]Oops.
[125:41.00]Well, I know what that is now.
[126:14.72]Introduced!
[126:15.22]I still have no idea how this game works.
[126:28.32]Should I explain it?
[126:29.48]What are you going to do?
[126:31.90]Slurp?
[126:46.24]You want me to do my spaghetti?
[126:47.72]You want to have my spaghetti?
[126:52.87]Did somebody come in and say, when's the next slurp?
[126:54.71]Is that what you said?
[126:58.63]I need to do one more and I'll have enough stars.
[127:13.16]a chunky one.
[127:15.23]Can't say, you know what I mean?
[127:27.31]Can we do a poll for Satori Landy?
[127:31.71]I feel like you're just going to say yes to deliberately piss off the people that don't want to hear me explain the game for like the 12th time in the last two years.
[127:41.15]And you're going to deliberately just try to annoy them.
[127:42.73]Because I'm going to sit here for five minutes and explain the whole game again.
[127:46.53]That's what I know what you're doing.
[127:47.98]Because I would vote for that.
[127:50.14]If I'm in the chat right now and I'm watching this streamer, I'm going to be like, yeah, let's get him to explain the game so all these people get fucking annoyed and leave.
[128:01.38]I understand your comedic effort.
[128:04.73]I get it.
[128:06.28]That's why I'm shutting it down.
[128:35.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[128:35.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[128:35.90]Okay.
[128:36.22]There's the 4.
[128:37.00]3.
[128:37.04]Very nice.
[128:37.88]Can't be over here.
[128:41.54]8.
[128:41.56]Complete.
[129:02.20]3, 4, 3, 2, 3.
[129:03.72]Is it a heart?
[129:18.42]Explain the game and annoy people.
[129:20.05]Well, I just said I wasn't going to do it.
[129:21.61]This vote doesn't mean anything to me.
[129:32.84]What did you eat today?
[129:34.28]I had one single cup of yogurt.
[129:38.14]And a Sprite.
[129:43.66]I had... What?
[129:49.11]Somebody said... What?
[129:57.51]That is so shocking to hear that.
[130:00.75]What?
[130:03.19]Oh, yeah, guys.
[130:03.75]Cranberries, S tier for me.
[130:05.25]Mashed potatoes, gravy.
[130:06.25]Oh, man.
[130:06.71]Oh, you know.
[130:07.85]We got this little butterball turkey.
[130:09.67]Oh, it's so good.
[130:11.23]Well, I had a yogurt today.
[130:12.64]That's it.
[130:14.70]Nice spaghetti, liar.
[130:27.43]Shit!
[130:28.35]Do I only get one star for these?
[130:30.66]I'm getting less stars.
[130:38.02]Oh, clear the puzzle, no misses, no hints.
[130:41.42]I'm getting two.
[130:42.08]I could get up to three.
[130:45.27]Alright, I gotta get... Why lie, viewers, when you're eating spaghetti?
[130:53.27]um because there's no actually spaghetti over here I think I can get this whole thing one so let me mark it there's one one two three four five one two three four five nope
[131:30.93]Alright, it's getting a little weird here.
[131:32.27]One.
[131:32.43]Nine.
[131:35.01]Completed that.
[131:36.61]Seven now.
[131:41.20]Reset it.
[131:41.52]I don't care, reset.
[131:47.06]I didn't mean to go that far.
[131:51.36]Why would you lie about having spaghetti?
[131:52.90]I don't know, because I thought it was funny?
[132:16.77]You're a cheater.
[132:17.19]I'm not cheating.
[132:25.08]Oh, that's a big raid.
[132:27.16]BoxBox coming in with a monster raid.
[132:30.92]What's going on?
[132:31.42]Thanks for the raid, BoxBox.
[132:33.91]Hope you're doing well.
[132:35.89]Hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving coming over.
[132:37.47]You celebrated.
[132:38.89]You as well, BoxBox.
[132:41.53]Welcome, we're playing Picross.
[132:42.47]We're just doing a chill, uh, night stream for two, three hours or so.
[132:47.66]Hanging out.
[132:49.52]Welcome.
[132:50.00]Thanks a lot.
[132:51.64]We're discussing our favorite, um, Thanksgiving dinner items.
[132:57.72]And what I said, I said that my favorite Thanksgiving item was cranberry sauce in the can.
[133:05.13]That you have to actually get it and it splies out and hits the thing.
[133:11.35]People thought that was kind of weird, but that is one of my favorite items.
[133:21.08]But yeah, welcome.
[133:21.62]Hope you had a good holiday.
[133:23.33]Again, if you celebrate it.
[133:31.81]I think I can do this.
[133:32.59]That's one.
[133:33.97]Oh, by the way, BoxBox, you gotta check out.
[133:39.61]You gotta check out Picross.
[133:40.57]It's like one of the most fun games ever.
[133:48.68]Cranberry sauce is underrated.
[133:52.12]He was eating yogurt spaghetti.
[133:53.66]Don't lie.
[133:56.05]Can I do this?
[133:56.47]Let's see.
[133:56.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[133:57.19]Yeah.
[134:00.63]this whole line now the whole thing opens up oh yeah mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
[134:40.18]I did it.
[134:43.54]Satellite.
[134:45.58]Alright.
[134:47.24]This is Miku Picross, which what that means is this is a, you unlock pictures and music from Miku if you're a Miku fan.
[134:55.55]I'm just a Picross fan.
[135:01.78]I mean, who doesn't like Miku, right?
[135:09.12]Alright, do I have enough for another song?
[135:10.52]Alright, I need one more level and I got it.
[135:15.85]Dude, it's annoying.
[135:25.93]All you do is eat spaghetti and lie.
[135:38.26]That's a weird trait to have.
[135:39.40]I don't know why I feel like that's, I don't know, for some reason I feel like that's like a relationship thing.
[135:52.56]Like we're like breaking up.
[135:56.48]All you do is eat spaghetti and lie.
[135:57.82]Like, what the fuck?
[136:04.20]I feel like, what is this?
[136:20.33]Uh, this is part of the seven.
[136:22.35]I don't want to go that far.
[136:28.44]Actually, I can because there's a two there.
[136:35.82]I might be going a little quick.
[136:37.32]Some people are saying, hey, he's going really fast.
[136:38.92]It's hard to keep up.
[136:42.89]You'll start to pick it up.
[136:44.47]Once you get it, you get it.
[136:49.31]Okay, this is like an actual 2 out of 3 chance that I get this right over here.
[136:56.80]There's a 50-50 chance that it's either here or here.
[136:58.38]I'm going to flip the coin.
[137:00.72]Heads.
[137:33.18]Just don't make another mistake.
[137:34.40]I need the stars.
[137:50.43]So then it has to be down here.
[137:51.37]I've reduced it.
[137:52.87]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[137:57.35]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[138:07.52]Uh, I can get this.
[138:23.80]Play this high.
[138:25.90]Um.
[138:27.42]I mean, that's a, eh.
[138:33.70]I feel like it would be very difficult.
[138:45.91]Perfect.
[138:46.19]Alright, so five, one, two.
[138:56.48]This seven's done, so it has to be here.
[139:00.56]Very nice.
[139:00.94]Very nice.
[139:02.80]Very nice.
[139:04.00]Wow.
[139:05.10]Filled it all in in one second.
[139:06.28]I feel like it would be annoying high.
[139:08.68]Yeah.
[139:18.57]But I would rather... Here's another thing, too.
[139:20.61]I made this... I've talked about this before.
[139:23.27]I don't want, like, you know, doing drugs to be something that's like, oh, I'm gonna do that in stream.
[139:27.63]Like, isn't that funny?
[139:28.31]Isn't that cool?
[139:29.81]Um, no.
[139:30.69]I've thought about, like, stuff like that before, but it's just... I'd rather not.
[139:34.43]I'm completely honest.
[139:38.07]That's not to say, like, oh, it would be, like, maybe it'd be kind of fun.
[139:40.34]I just don't want...
[139:42.19]I don't know.
[139:42.93]I feel like I'd rather just not do that.
[139:56.29]Liar.
[139:59.11]You talk about it like every stream.
[140:00.55]I definitely do not.
[140:04.45]That is an embellishment.
[140:13.92]And don't get me wrong.
[140:14.78]Like recreational marijuana, if it's legal where you are and you, you know, safely doing it and, you know, privacy of your own home or among, you know, friends in a place where it's safe and you're going to be, you know, safe about it.
[140:31.05]By all means, right?
[140:31.69]But I don't know if I want to make it like a content piece.
[140:35.31]I think that's going another step forward.
[140:45.68]Because I mean, so we all know the famous clock fiasco, right?
[140:51.69]The big clock scandal.
[140:54.47]where I had been, you know, doing marijuana, because, well, one of the main reasons why I started taking in any amount of THC in the first place was because the pain problem that I have.
[141:06.24]So I wasn't like I was, I mean, I didn't start really, oh, I'm gonna just get high every single day.
[141:12.57]That wasn't any ever what I want to do.
[141:14.21]And that's not what I do either.
[141:15.05]But
[141:18.19]That, like, I just can't do that anymore.
[141:21.14]It was very clear that I can't read a clock and people are going to know.
[141:30.54]There's no way people are going to, I'm going to be able to hide that.
[141:34.15]Like, oh, I take a little bit of THC and like relax and stream.
[141:36.93]And I can't read an analog clock and people go, what time is it?
[141:39.51]I'm like, I don't, um, I don't know.
[141:42.19]It's like, what do you mean you don't know?
[141:44.23]How is it possible?
[141:46.70]How is it possible that you don't know that?
[141:50.50]It's like, I don't know, and then it's embarrassing because I can't?
[141:53.27]You said you lied.
[141:55.21]Lied about what?
[141:55.75]Being high that day?
[142:01.57]Did I say that?
[142:05.17]Was I actually high that day?
[142:06.55]I thought I was.
[142:07.17]I don't remember.
[142:13.13]Did I make that up?
[142:14.36]No, I don't think so.
[142:16.10]Maybe I told you I made it up so you didn't think I was a moron.
[142:18.72]I don't know, there's something else going on there.
[142:22.38]He's high right now.
[142:23.28]He has dementia?
[142:33.41]Behind the clip of me talking about it, I'm actually curious.
[142:35.51]I forget what the lie was.
[142:43.65]There's a famous person.
[142:48.17]What do they say?
[142:49.63]They said, as long as you... It's like, tell the truth always so you never have to remember anything.
[142:55.32]Who said that?
[142:55.82]It's like Mark Twain or something.
[143:00.44]It's like, always tell the truth so you never have to remember anything.
[143:05.93]Not Winston Churchill.
[143:06.65]I think it was Mark Twain.
[143:14.28]Lady Gaga?
[143:15.32]No, I think it was Mark Twain.
[143:22.60]Fuck!
[143:25.65]How deep does that lie go, I wonder?
[143:29.45]Here's another problem.
[143:31.07]I have kind of bad memory problems anyways.
[143:33.89]So I actually don't even remember if I was... Oh, come on.
[143:36.18]I don't remember if I was just fucking around or not.
[143:38.28]Like when I said that, that time that I told you I was lying about it.
[143:40.74]I might have just been making it up.
[143:41.62]I don't remember.
[143:42.88]I actually don't remember.
[143:44.78]It was Pee Wee Herman.
[143:47.54]Is this it?
[143:52.38]No, this is just... Why are you clipping this?
[143:55.20]The left and right are numbers, which indicate how many cubes need to be filled in in that row or column.
[144:01.88]For instance, there has to be five.
[144:04.35]Why did you just link this to me?
[144:06.39]This is just me explaining the game.
[144:20.24]I think you said you were not I, then later came clean that you were.
[144:26.81]I can't keep track of what the fuck this guy ever says.
[144:38.94]You lied about being high in the concrete level, not the clock.
[144:41.80]I think that's correct.
[144:44.14]That's what it was.
[144:45.02]That's what it was.
[144:45.74]Yep.
[144:46.38]I think we're mixing it up a little bit.
[144:47.58]So let me clear the air.
[144:49.12]Let me get a clear picture of what happened.
[144:51.54]So during the Hitman 3 streams,
[144:54.80]I was walking around one of the levels where it's like, I think it's like the club or something, right?
[144:58.67]It's a big concrete level.
[145:00.71]And I did not know where I was going.
[145:01.93]And it was so frustrating and I was getting so pissed off and so agitated by it.
[145:06.69]And I remember looking over at the chat and being like, people were saying,
[145:12.29]This can't be for real.
[145:13.50]He has to be under the influence.
[145:14.98]There's no way a person could be like this.
[145:16.66]I'm concerned about him.
[145:18.52]I remember reading people saying, I'm concerned about this.
[145:21.52]I'm very concerned about him.
[145:24.24]And I was just like, fuck, I can't be this stupid.
[145:28.31]I was like, oh, I guess the edibles started kicking in.
[145:32.37]Yeah, I remember I lied about that.
[145:33.63]Yep, 100%.
[145:36.97]That's what it was.
[145:40.73]So I made it up that I... Oh, yeah, guys.
[145:43.74]I took a little bit before the stream.
[145:45.00]It's like kicking in.
[145:46.54]And everyone's like, oh, okay.
[145:48.62]Alright.
[145:49.72]Now it makes sense.
[145:50.74]Alright, dude.
[145:51.20]Do you.
[145:51.69]You're good.
[145:52.15]I'm sitting there going like, fucking thank God.
[145:59.37]Clock one was real.
[146:00.53]It was.
[146:03.54]I actually remember people writing in the chat.
[146:05.75]It was so... Just like, man, he's not pretending and it's not even funny.
[146:10.77]It's just like concerning that he doesn't know where he is.
[146:12.61]That's so funny in a way though.
[146:21.71]I made up that I was high to make so you didn't think I was like having like some type of problem.
[146:30.46]Like I didn't want to never think I was stupid.
[146:37.95]Yeah, and then, alright, restart.
[146:40.01]And then it came out later, like months later, and I was like, guys, I made that up, right?
[146:44.85]Okay, so yeah, we clear the air on this.
[146:59.24]I gotta be careful, because, whoa, stop doing that.
[147:01.16]These are not guarantees.
[147:02.28]This is a guarantee.
[147:03.00]No, it's not.
[147:04.66]How did I just get that?
[147:12.86]Are there any lies you've told on stream that you haven't come clean about?
[147:15.06]I... I don't... I don't think so.
[147:18.61]I mean, I kind of just... I mess around a lot, like we all do here.
[147:24.07]I mean, there's plenty of opportunities where I just kind of say just stuff just to make up a scenario for fun.
[147:31.86]Fuck!
[147:32.74]No, I'm not going back...
[147:40.29]I think it's clear when I do that, though.
[147:41.69]I think it's pretty set in stone that that's me just messing around.
[147:45.63]Spaghetti and meatballs.
[147:57.70]Yeah, I mean, but did you honestly believe that was real?
[148:02.90]Come on, Gwyn.
[148:09.40]Yes.
[148:24.45]This is like almost the whole screen filled in.
[148:30.37]What is this?
[148:33.89]A chair.
[148:43.50]Why would you lie about it?
[148:46.12]I don't know.
[148:47.82]Because it's fun just to like make up fun scenarios that just... I don't know.
[148:52.54]Why not?
[148:53.48]It's fun.
[148:58.33]Oh, I didn't even click on it.
[149:12.64]Who let you in here?
[149:15.18]I did.
[149:18.34]Buy the first song.
[149:19.46]I've seen that a lot.
[149:20.04]I'll do that.
[149:28.81]What is the first song?
[149:36.15]Which one of these is the first song?
[149:44.62]Hey guys, did you know spaghetti and meatballs?
[149:50.29]But you forgot about the laugh track right after that.
[149:56.89]Actually, it's kind of funny what he said.
[149:58.85]Alright, where is the first song?
[150:08.69]How was your Thanksgiving?
[150:09.39]It was great.
[150:25.32]That guy spammed spaghetti and meatballs dozens of times.
[150:32.32]No.
[150:35.26]Did I just catch the spammer?
[150:37.06]And I thought it was... Whatever.
[150:39.13]Alright, what's the name of the song that you want me to unlock?
[150:49.95]I don't... Was it this one?
[150:57.37]That's hard.
[150:57.81]It's hard for me to translate that.
[151:04.26]Which one?
[151:04.64]The one you were on?
[151:09.84]The previous one, the previous one?
[151:17.29]This one?
[151:26.86]I'm trying to, I can't read it.
[151:37.46]This one.
[151:58.03]Chat read it wrong.
[152:01.27]I'll put it on.
[152:02.66]And blast it.
[152:03.32]Well, I'm not going to blast it, but I'll play it.
[152:05.22]Is it instrumental?
[152:15.59]No.
[152:16.41]The one I bought has vocals, right?
[152:17.51]Here it is.
[152:29.98]Please don't blast that I have a headache.
[152:31.22]No, I'm not gonna.
[152:34.70]Let's see how it is.
[152:35.22]I think that's all I can do down here now.
[152:39.06]7, 8, 9.
[152:39.30]I can do this.
[152:59.61]There we go This one this one's god this was this one
[153:44.45]Copper Rose again?
[153:48.03]You're right.
[153:53.60]2, 1?
[153:54.88]This one down here is a 2 somewhere.
[154:13.78]Alright, hold on.
[154:14.32]2, 2.
[154:15.04]That's a 1.
[154:18.38]Okay.
[154:22.64]Cool.
[154:24.56]He's actually pretty good at Picross.
[154:28.01]When I'm just... When I focus... I've been playing Picross for years.
[154:31.31]For 10 years.
[154:32.45]I remember the first Picross game that I ever played.
[154:35.49]I think it was on the original DS.
[154:39.05]The original Nintendo DS.
[154:42.13]It's fun.
[154:45.77]Now, alright, this is very beginner to intermediate stuff.
[154:50.99]There's... Once you get into the 20x20, like 50x50, it gets really... You have to pay a lot of attention to everything going on.
[154:58.82]I don't know why my voice just did that.
[155:02.22]But my eyes were very confused by it.
[155:07.07]Yeah, see?
[155:07.61]10x10.
[155:07.67]This is all 10x10.
[155:09.11]Here, 20x20.
[155:14.78]This is obviously level 3.
[155:17.96]20x20 is pretty... I'd say 15x15 is pretty standard.
[155:20.48]20x20 gets pretty hard.
[155:24.28]Do you want 20x20?
[155:26.89]I'll try 20x20.
[155:27.33]Let's see if I can handle it.
[155:29.33]You can see everything, right?
[155:31.53]Alright, so this is 20x20, so therefore 15, 16, 17, 18, so... 15, so that means 5 has to be on each side.
[155:46.59]They get pretty wacky.
[155:48.69]Alright, 17, 18.
[155:49.17]Let me think, if this is a 10, and it's 20 by 20, that means that as long as there is... 10, let's see...
[156:15.93]I can't do anything in the middle really, because there's just no way to know where it sits.
[156:19.45]I feel like there's more I could get from here.
[156:28.18]Can I, let me see what, 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, is this 20 here?
[156:37.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, this is 19.
[156:39.84]I think I got it though, because that's one.
[156:46.64]There's only one slot that's not filled in here, and I don't know where it could be.
[156:58.72]Could this be two in the middle?
[157:02.72]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[157:05.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[157:08.34]I don't think I can reliably fill these in.
[157:11.30]But I guess so, because that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[157:18.71]They both could do that.
[157:19.85]Although this is not something you would actually know.
[157:21.95]Are there any 20s?
[157:28.62]Like a whole row.
[157:29.48]I need an edge.
[157:35.52]4, 15.
[157:35.64]I need an edge.
[157:36.36]At least some kind of edge to start.
[157:42.22]Shit!
[157:43.17]Alright, restart.
[157:55.85]Part of the 10.
[157:56.19]This is part of the 9.
[157:57.13]Alright.
[158:04.26]I just did the exact same thing.
[158:07.56]Fill in the 7, 10.
[158:07.96]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, space.
[158:08.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[158:13.02]I mean, it could be... So what, like two out from each side?
[158:28.89]I don't know where the space, though, is.
[158:31.03]But it has to be like this.
[158:33.33]And it has to be at least these ones up here.
[158:35.21]Because I don't know where the space is.
[158:38.07]I am so annoyed!
[158:39.52]Whatever, I'm going to leave it.
[158:42.50]Because I don't know where the space is going to be.
[158:44.98]Because it could be... Whatever, I got it.
[158:46.22]That's enough info to help.
[158:50.54]Dude, I have an oatmeal brain.
[158:51.60]I can't... That's a lot of info, though.
[159:06.61]This is a good start.
[159:13.76]Perfect.
[159:14.78]Now, I don't know anything about that.
[159:16.80]Okay.
[159:26.89]What about the top row?
[159:28.17]Two...
[159:39.18]3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Although I can fill in some of this though Because it's definitely in this row here, I just don't know if this way it's definitely here That means the two has to be here then yeah, what do you mean the two is not there how is that possible what I
[160:05.06]Oh, shit.
[160:07.45]When they get big like this, it's... It's alright.
[160:10.21]I just can't get three strikes.
[160:26.89]I mean, it has to be at least one... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
[160:36.35]Need more info?
[160:40.27]Good.
[160:43.49]Ten.
[160:44.99]Nine.
[160:46.73]Five, one.
[160:49.81]Okay.
[160:51.77]This is probably part of a two.
[161:06.19]Well, here's the 12.
[161:06.73]Can I do anything with the 12?
[161:08.57]Let's see.
[161:08.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[161:09.85]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[161:10.86]Okay, so it has to be like this.
[161:12.08]One more, right?
[161:12.60]Yep.
[161:16.64]Why are we yelling at each other?
[161:35.97]Why are people screaming at each other?
[161:37.43]Turn off the music?
[161:44.73]I have to admit, it has been a little distracting.
[161:48.18]So if it's a little distracting for me, the person streaming, then some of you guys must be unbearable for some of you.
[161:59.50]I can't turn it off from here.
[162:00.74]I don't want to give up.
[162:14.55]Turn it up.
[162:15.23]No, I'm not going to turn it up.
[162:20.17]I'm getting closer, so not much longer.
[162:22.29]Okay.
[162:42.58]Um.
[162:44.43]I love Miku.
[162:46.29]I do.
[162:47.19]Miku's great.
[162:48.27]But I think we're going to put on a different song.
[162:52.03]Give me streamer's choice.
[163:21.39]I don't know why I wanted to listen to this for one second.
[163:23.50]And this is worse because this is probably really copywritten.
[163:31.62]That's another one.
[163:32.38]Never mind.
[163:45.70]Where's Miku?
[163:50.62]Austin Powers?
[163:51.58]We did that already.
[163:53.88]Um... Hmm.
[164:01.90]Oh, I can just play Miku songs that I like!
[164:06.30]Holy shit, that's actually true.
[164:27.69]Okay.
[164:31.06]Is there more than one version?
[164:41.32]Guess it was the one.
[164:44.07]Probably here, but I'm afraid to get three strikes.
[165:09.47]Nice.
[165:12.33]That was risky, but it was worth it.
[165:13.57]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[165:23.88]Seven.
[165:25.18]Part of the ten.
[165:53.24]That was 11.
[165:55.34]Alright, so that was fun.
[165:59.33]What else should I do?
[166:04.03]Are both songs playing right now?
[166:05.71]I don't think so.
[166:06.65]I turned it on.
[166:19.81]He was saying, play triple, triple baka, triple baka.
[166:25.03]Okay.
[166:33.29]Yes, yes, yes.
[166:34.65]Have I ever heard this?
[166:45.93]Have I heard this?
[166:56.00]Where's the two go?
[166:57.16]This is one, two... Oh, it has to be this way.
[166:59.73]All these need to be filled in.
[167:19.56]Yeah, this is 9.
[167:20.42]No, this is not 5.
[167:22.17]6, 7, 8, 9.
[167:22.33]And then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:23.11]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:23.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:24.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:26.79]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:43.76]that's good to see this oh this is definitely part of the seven
[168:15.42]Well, I would imagine this is probably the 4, but I can't deduce that, but I'm gonna go for it!
[168:46.31]That's three strikes.
[169:20.80]Alright, I'm gonna finish it I'll finish it I'll finish it shit I'm not gonna get any points with this One two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[169:53.13]I don't know what side it's on.
[169:54.21]Or do I?
[169:56.83]I do.
[170:01.89]What happened?
[170:03.09]What'd I do?
[170:03.53]What happened?
[170:04.13]What'd I do wrong?
[170:07.06]Where's the one?
[170:08.22]What?
[170:08.56]Hold on.
[170:12.72]It's here.
[170:14.54]Oh no.
[170:17.50]That's bad.
[170:23.82]I can't reset.
[170:24.72]No, I can't.
[170:25.34]I've been doing it for too long.
[170:28.00]That's why it... These 20x20s, they take a lot of... You just can't just go fast.
[170:35.97]It's alright.
[170:38.13]Any more requests?
[170:42.33]I'll take any requests, by the way.
[170:43.48]It doesn't just have to be Miku.
[170:44.36]As long as it's not going to get the channel turned off.
[170:49.80]The world is mine.
[175:08.39]made like 15 mistakes alright what was it what was it somebody said I have a request what was it uh this one rolling girl this one is it right
[175:43.13]How come these aren't in this game?
[175:47.78]I don't want to misrepresent this game.
[175:51.56]These are not in the game.
[175:52.32]I'm playing them on YouTube.
[175:55.32]I wonder why they wouldn't be in the game.
[176:00.05]Probably a licensing problem.
[176:03.53]Who made this game?
[176:06.47]Isn't it SEGA?
[176:07.89]Doesn't SEGA own this stuff?
[176:09.55]Who made this?
[176:10.09]Did SEGA not make this?
[176:18.05]Probably not.
[176:18.75]Huh.
[176:20.55]Alright, that one was fun.
[176:21.19]I'm gonna go back to some easier ones.
[176:26.22]I wanna at least clear this second row here, the second one.
[176:28.34]Okay.
[176:37.91]How's the volume?
[176:38.43]Good?
[176:38.61]Okay.
[177:00.58]I love when this happens.
[177:10.17]You know, it can't be anywhere over here.
[177:12.31]That helps free up a lot of space.
[177:15.75]Usually.
[177:22.25]1, 2, 3, 4.
[177:22.51]1, 2, 3.
[177:23.03]Alright.
[177:25.95]Well, I mean, I know it's here and I know it's like here.
[177:52.23]Like magnet.
[178:03.14]I feel like I can get this.
[178:05.36]Yeah.
[178:15.64]Oh, interesting.
[178:17.02]This is one.
[178:36.45]Huh?
[178:37.61]Oh!
[178:38.63]I thought that was part of the... Ah, I just wasn't looking down.
[178:40.93]Shit, come on.
[178:41.47]I can't make those kind of mistakes.
[178:42.49]That's a rookie mistake.
[178:48.54]Is it a different one?
[178:54.29]Oh, I already heard this one.
[179:07.29]El Polka?
[179:13.28]Polka?
[179:13.70]What is it?
[179:20.50]Liv and Polka.
[179:25.63]Oh, it's this one.
[179:27.43]I know this one.
[179:29.45]I know this one.
[179:56.63]This is a classic song.
[179:57.89]After I fill this row, I'm going to see what the special puzzle is.
[180:27.05]7, 8, 9.
[180:27.15]I guess I could do these too.
[180:29.63]6, yes.
[180:29.77]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[180:32.91]Yo.
[180:32.99]What?
[180:33.13]Yo!
[180:33.61]Why is everybody saying yo?
[180:55.44]Alright, so this is part of the 3, then we know 1, 2, 3 cannot be down here.
[180:59.66]Doesn't really help that much.
[181:08.53]I mean, maybe it does a little, because it's either 1, 2, 3, 4, or it's here.
[181:13.31]Should I just go for it?
[181:15.27]Should I just go for it over here?
[181:21.17]It's either over here, or it's right here.
[181:25.58]Shit, I'm stuck.
[181:26.68]I'm going for it.
[181:27.98]You can call me a cheater if you want, but I got what I needed.
[182:10.57]What is this?
[182:11.15]What the hell is that?
[182:15.65]This is different.
[182:16.31]This is different artist.
[182:24.02]Play it.
[182:31.30]Play it.
[182:33.48]Play it.
[182:34.48]Turn it off.
[182:35.70]Play it.
[182:37.04]This is called.
[182:39.83]Kikuo?
[182:40.43]Kikuo, love me, love me, love me.
[182:44.20]Is this a different artist?
[183:08.06]This actually helps, because now it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[183:10.14]That doesn't really help that much, though.
[183:20.63]Don't tell him.
[183:24.01]Play Time Machine.
[183:25.79]Okay.
[183:27.61]Time Machine.
[183:39.08]I said, fuck you.
[183:40.10]What?
[183:40.36]What the fuck?
[183:51.90]What?
[183:55.34]That was a bonus track.
[183:56.36]We weren't supposed to even hear that one.
[184:15.37]How do you do Donald Duck?
[184:23.94]Something like that, right?
[184:27.90]You go like... I'm stumped.
[184:34.16]It's definitely this row.
[184:38.57]This row of this one has the most info.
[184:40.41]1, 2, 3, 4...
[184:48.38]This is a one, that's a one.
[184:49.64]Alright, there's a two after this.
[184:54.45]Why is everyone so angry?
[184:56.43]You're cringe.
[185:08.48]You skipped a good song.
[185:09.60]I didn't skip it.
[185:10.28]We listened to half of it.
[185:23.35]One, two, one, one.
[185:29.58]Go back, liar!
[185:30.92]We listened to half of it!
[185:44.92]I think this actually helps here.
[185:46.62]It does.
[185:51.12]Okay, so I can do that.
[185:54.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[185:54.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[185:54.97]That's all I can do.
[185:56.51]But this is 3.
[186:01.32]That's cool.
[186:03.76]Helps a little.
[186:17.51]I'm going to unfollow.
[186:18.97]Why?
[186:19.49]Because I skipped a song?
[186:23.50]I'll put a streamer's choice on.
[187:00.42]There.
[187:00.90]What if Spraymush tries to run through it?
[187:05.54]I thought he said, bro.
[187:26.77]Black.
[187:27.05]I'm going for it.
[187:29.71]Yes!
[187:30.11]This is the never video.
[188:13.13]This actually goes.
[188:14.15]It does, yeah.
[188:16.31]This way, I'm gonna, we'll keep this on for a little bit.
[188:17.86]Those of you that have not heard this before, it's a great soundtrack.
[188:22.08]It's by Terry Scott Taylor.
[188:39.59]Pretty good.
[188:41.43]Really nostalgic.
[188:42.52]Nostalgic.
[188:43.72]Can't even say it.
[188:45.54]Now we turn this up.
[188:46.36]Of course.
[188:46.68]Oh, you don't think we're going to turn this up all the way?
[189:12.47]This is not Miku.
[189:14.23]I'm playing, oh yeah, it's Hatsune Miku, the game where you do Picross.
[189:19.53]Of course, the soundtrack is going to be very important.
[189:23.37]This is incredibly important.
[189:46.58]Let me see, what should I put on?
[189:54.03]Oh, yup.
[189:54.79]This one.
[189:55.11]Let's go.
[189:56.71]Let's go.
[190:11.73]Dude, this guy fucking loves the saxophone.
[190:14.93]It's great.
[190:15.19]This whole game has a vibe.
[190:42.17]This one's tricky.
[190:46.69]I feel like it kind of has to... Wait.
[190:49.31]Oh, I don't know.
[190:49.85]I really don't know.
[190:51.91]I know that.
[190:54.43]That's all I know.
[191:06.79]Yeah, hey, why don't you fucking take it?
[191:08.72]Sit down for this one.
[191:11.08]Sit down for this one.
[191:35.36]Dude, love, I do.
[191:36.30]I like the saxophone.
[191:38.78]It's a fucking, it's an unbelievable instrument.
[191:41.11]And plus, what do you mean?
[191:46.17]It's an oboe.
[191:48.01]This is an oboe.
[192:20.52]Oh, now it just cascades.
[192:53.40]Now we bring everything together.
[192:54.50]Here we go.
[192:55.66]This goes hard?
[192:59.40]Of course it does.
[193:20.52]This whole soundtrack is... This is probably... This is the best soundtrack of any video game that is ever released.
[193:25.64]I genuinely mean that.
[193:26.64]I really believe that.
[193:28.09]So yeah, you guys feel about this one.
[193:38.03]This one's a great one.
[193:39.21]You guys are gonna love this one.
[193:44.97]This one's pretty topical today.
[193:48.39]What is this?
[193:49.67]This is the Neverhood soundtrack.
[193:52.37]The OST for the Neverhood by Terry Scott Taylor.
[194:09.08]Potatoes and my peas.
[194:11.96]Tomatoes and potatoes and my peas.
[194:19.18]This is the shit that would play when you were doing a puzzle.
[194:24.18]They just added to the whole thing.
[194:49.50]Can we get a piano?
[194:50.64]Is this what you play when you play your iPad games?
[194:57.12]No.
[194:57.24]Oh, this one's good too.
[195:06.17]This one's really good.
[195:30.04]What?
[195:30.68]Ah, fuck.
[195:37.76]It's chill Thanksgiving vibes.
[195:39.20]Come on.
[196:09.50]That's the three, right?
[196:11.06]No, it's the four.
[196:13.98]Oh, I'm such an idiot.
[196:17.10]What else we got?
[196:32.37]Do I have to play the... Come on, I do this like every like a year or two.
[196:39.92]In the sequel to The Neverhood, there was a bonus room.
[196:43.02]It was called Skull Monkeys.
[196:44.56]So there was a bonus room in the sequel to The Neverhood where you go in it and they sing you a song.
[196:56.32]And this is the song that plays when you're in the bonus room.
[196:59.12]It's been the inspiration for a lot of music in the video game world.
[197:02.32]If you didn't know, look it up.
[197:06.62]Here it is.
[197:08.39]Here's a little bonus room, because I know you've had it tough.
[197:14.00]And here's a little bonus tune about collecting real cool stuff.
[197:20.43]Yes, here's a little bonus room where
[197:31.71]You can linger because I'm your video friend.
[197:37.13]Think of me as a father figure with a hand to land.
[197:42.87]Here's a little bonus room where you don't have to worry.
[197:47.65]You don't?
[197:48.59]Take your sweet time.
[197:51.05]You need not.
[197:53.91]Oh, you're looking incredible.
[197:56.69]You're the bomb.
[197:59.17]And me, I'm kind of like your dad.
[198:01.71]And a little like your mom.
[198:05.57]There are no monsters here.
[198:08.44]Hey, wait.
[198:09.18]Look over there.
[198:13.74]I was just kidding.
[198:16.21]Don't be scared And when you turn this game off In the real world once again You won't have to play Make me leave Or try to pretend Cause I'll be right there When you open your hand Is this too loud?
[198:36.20]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[198:36.88]Cause I'm your little invisible Musical friend
[198:42.37]So show me to your pets or show me to your pals.
[198:48.01]You really will impress every nifty guy and gal.
[198:53.79]Show them you're individual.
[198:56.48]Show them you are bold.
[198:59.00]Besides, I get residuals for every game that's sold.
[199:06.22]I'm your little invisible musical friend.
[199:14.55]Somebody said, when Jerma gets the aux cord.
[199:22.25]So that plays when you're in a bonus and it was funny and it was like weird and people thought it was like, what the fuck is happening?
[199:26.83]It's like a secret room.
[199:31.48]There you go.
[199:35.21]Alright, we're doing streamer's choice again.
[199:40.17]What should I play for streamer's choice?
[199:53.46]I got one.
[199:59.03]This is a good one.
[200:03.70]I don't think people are going to be upset about this one.
[200:06.32]Alright, I got to pay attention now.
[200:30.78]So three could be here.
[200:33.07]It's probably there.
[200:33.83]And it is.
[200:38.91]Now the real question is, there is a two and a one hanging out here.
[200:42.75]There's also a three.
[200:48.35]Ah, I took a guess.
[200:49.25]I just wanted to get it done.
[200:52.01]If I had put the marker there, I wouldn't know it wasn't there.
[200:58.31]That's three strikes.
[200:59.25]Shit.
[201:01.69]This is Superstar Saga, the battle music.
[201:04.47]Or the Game Boy Advance, I believe.
[201:06.25]Two, one, two, one.
[201:24.54]Two.
[201:27.65]One.
[201:27.89]Two.
[201:39.60]Yoko Shimomura might be probably one of the best, I think, the best that ever was, I think.
[201:49.28]So many soundtracks by Yoko Shimomura were, I mean, they're just unbeatable.
[201:56.47]I don't understand how it's possible to have that many 10 out of 10 soundtracks in a row every time.
[202:05.54]I don't understand.
[202:08.75]Because it's not just one or two.
[202:12.21]It's all of them.
[202:14.75]Every single one of them.
[202:19.89]Being that talented and being that connected to music and stuff, it's just unbelievable.
[202:25.57]It really is.
[202:35.88]Redditor music taste?
[202:37.85]I don't know.
[202:38.47]I could... Alright, that's bait.
[202:41.81]That's bait I was about to take.
[202:43.07]I was about to just eat the onion there.
[202:46.10]I was about to eat the onion.
[202:46.84]Alright, never mind.
[202:48.14]Alright, chat's choice.
[202:51.42]What do you want?
[202:58.56]Chat's choice.
[203:02.66]Whoa, Miku?
[203:03.18]Alright, well give me a Miku song.
[203:14.03]Magnet, that was one, yeah.
[203:15.11]I remember seeing that earlier.
[203:17.03]Magnet.
[203:17.41]Is this correct?
[207:25.42]Alright, what's some other music that I want to show you?
[207:39.39]Hmm.
[207:41.85]Do more Neverhood?
[207:53.39]I was going to play the Avengers theme.
[207:57.37]Because I wanted to have the mods, I was going to say in private, to count how many bad chests there were.
[208:01.34]People already started doing it.
[208:06.12]But my joke is ruined.
[208:07.54]What should I play?
[208:08.08]I guess we're doing this.
[208:20.34]I feel like it's right here.

[208:49.80]It used to be Stylo.
[209:05.03]Stylo is... I don't know, I just like the beat.
[209:22.05]Yeah, I'll put it on after this.
[209:25.97]You guys get mad if I put it on now?
[209:34.71]This stream is definitely not going to be up anymore.
[209:37.45]It's going to get dropped in a second.

[241:51.89]Do the Mob Psycho intro?
[241:54.55]No, I don't want to wa- Okay, I don't want to watch the Mob Psycho intro right now, because I want to watch it when I'm sitting on the couch, and, you know, it gets to that part, your favorite part, where, like, something cool is happening, a really beautifully animated sequence, and it hits that drop of the song, and you just, like, feel it, you feel, like, warm, and you're just like, here it comes, there it is, that's what I like!
[242:17.00]And then you rewind the YouTube video of the intro,
[242:22.84]Okay, let me ask you a question.
[242:25.49]And I want everyone to be real.

[247:31.53]Let's take a look at all the artwork.
[247:43.89]A sea of people asking for bloody stream and kickback, and he picks the one dude who wanted the Pokémon Salsa song.
[247:53.02]I thought it was interesting.
[247:55.52]I wanted to play it.
[251:07.16]That's pretty cool.
[251:10.58]You guys have fun?

[251:30.59]I got some sponsored stuff to do on Saturday.
[251:36.21]We are going to be playing Darktide.
[251:40.90]I've seen a lot about it.
[251:42.04]It looks really fun.
[251:44.36]Vermintide was really cool.
[251:45.62]So I'm actually really excited to play it.
[251:48.40]So I'm going to play Darktide.
[251:49.97]I'm going to try to get some...

[252:19.74]But I will see you guys on Saturday.
[252:22.62]Take care of yourselves.
[252:24.24]Again, happy Thanksgiving.
[252:27.06]That was Miku Picross.
[252:28.48]Actually, really good Picross.
[252:36.60]It's a little bit more beginner-friendly, I think.
[252:39.08]Which is a good thing, if you've never played it before.
[252:40.66]And if you like Miku, then obviously it's there.
[252:46.82]Appreciate it for hanging out.
[252:48.56]I'll see you guys soon.
[252:53.89]So Saturday's stream will start probably around 2.30 Pacific.
[252:58.93]I want to say.
[252:59.33]Somewhere between 2 and 2.30.
[253:01.41]I'd say 2.30 Pacific is probably a safe place to put it.
[253:03.79]Is the VOD ever going to get uploaded?
[253:06.72]Ah, that's a great question.
[253:07.66]I would just check in like 10 minutes.
[253:09.60]See if it's even there.
[253:18.74]Expect more of these though.
[253:22.03]Where we just kind of hang out.
[253:23.69]I open up something.
[253:25.21]It's a little more chill and we just play it and just do whatever.
[253:35.44]See you guys Saturday.
[253:38.78]Yeah, Breath of the Wild is like that too.
[253:40.36]It is.
[253:41.08]Although I can get a little high energy on those streams just because it's not very good.
[253:46.81]But it's still fun.
[253:58.80]And I am going to go.
[253:59.72]What am I?
[254:00.14]I'm going to go probably.
[254:01.08]I'm going to take a bath tonight, baby.
[254:03.23]What do you think?
[254:03.65]I'm going to take a bath, I think.
[254:11.45]I'm out.
[254:12.71]Happy Thanksgiving.
