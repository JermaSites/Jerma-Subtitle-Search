[00:01.83]No, no, it's not live.
[00:03.01]It's not live.
[00:03.98]I'm testing some software upgrades.
[00:05.96]And OBS just went live.
[00:07.98]This is not happening.
[00:09.14]Sorry, we're not starting for another four hours.
[00:15.26]Hey, guys.
[00:19.33]We're playing.
[00:20.11]We're going.
[00:21.05]Don't worry.
[00:24.25]Hi.
[00:26.09]Good afternoon.
[00:28.89]He's definitely live.
[00:30.07]Yeah, I am.
[00:32.86]Today, first let me make a tweet because, you know, how am I supposed to stream without a tweet?
[00:42.93]I'm going to call this one I Spy Mansion.
[00:51.12]I Spy, it doesn't matter.
[00:54.70]What's the title?
[00:55.29]Do I have a shitty title?
[00:56.19]No, it's pretty good.
[01:00.10]But I don't have a Twitter, how will I know?
[01:02.90]Just open up Twitter right now and go to Twitter.com slash Jerma985.
[01:07.90]You'll find me.
[01:09.30]And then you can see where the stream's happening.
[01:10.66]Alright, I... This is how you can tell how fucking dumb I am.
[01:15.31]While I was talking, I typed into my Twitter, www.slashgerman985.
[01:22.97]Not even like a Twitch.
[01:23.95]Hey, you know they're getting rid of URLs, you know that, right?
[01:32.63]That's the thing.
[01:36.69]In like five to ten years, guys, it's not gonna be www.twitch.tv.
[01:41.41]You're just gonna type in Twitch.
[01:43.21]URLs are going away.
[01:48.91]Early?
[01:49.19]Yeah, like a little early.
[01:52.72]What do I have for my, uh... What do I have for my, like, dishwasher repairman window?
[01:58.24]Between 3 and 4 Pacific?
[02:01.35]Sometimes between 2 and 4.
[02:02.83]Sometimes they come early.
[02:10.97]How's the search bar going to work?
[02:13.41]I don't know.
[02:15.19]That's a question for a scientist.
[02:18.79]And I am not a scientist.
[02:21.31]I'm a tuber and a streamer.
[02:29.19]So today...
[02:31.40]We're going to play a requested game.
[02:37.78]It is called I Spy and the Spooky Mansion Deluxe.
[02:47.63]Should be fun.
[02:48.43]It is a hidden object game.
[02:49.73]This idea came about during 700,000 games.
[02:54.25]We played a hidden object game and people were like, Oh, you know what a great hidden object game is that you should just unironically do a real stream on?
[03:01.33]is iSpy.
[03:03.12]So, here we are.
[03:07.80]iSpy Mountain Blade.
[03:09.40]Now, if you didn't watch the Mountain Blade stream last night, just, it was a great stream, I had a lot of fun.
[03:17.94]Just don't watch past, like, six and a half hours.
[03:21.00]Because this is a weird bug on Twitch, where, I think there's like a bug inside the browser, where, like, you know, your computer will crash if you watch past six and a half hours.
[03:33.84]I heard that it's only on that one VOD.
[03:40.01]I don't know why.
[03:46.15]Like, I think there's some kind of bug.
[03:48.91]You just can't watch it past 6 hours, something like that.
[03:54.74]But anyways, let's get started here.
[03:58.43]That sounds... I'm just kidding.
[03:59.57]It's not real.
[04:00.83]I had a fucking meltdown after like six and a half hours and I like... I like called out chat.
[04:07.75]It was messy.
[04:09.74]But, you know, I'm not perfect, you know?
[04:12.14]I'll be the first to tell you that.
[04:17.22]But we talked it out.
[04:18.20]We hashed it out.
[04:19.30]Everything's all good.
[04:26.44]But... I'm ready.
[04:29.32]Give people a few moments to trickle in here.
[04:34.66]Our marriage is saved.
[04:42.60]Worst chat experience.
[04:44.52]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:46.72]Here we go.
[04:49.81]How do I press this button?
[04:50.83]Which one is it?
[04:52.25]Oh, right.
[04:52.53]I have to capture my whole desktop.
[04:54.87]So hopefully there's no, like, fucking... Hopefully there's no, like, bad folders on here.
[04:59.01]Like, what could be on that folder is tax documents.
[05:03.00]No, I'm, like, serious.
[05:04.06]Hopefully that's not there.
[05:06.68]I did recently do that.
[05:09.86]That's 10 community subs from Maddy Numbers.
[05:13.96]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[05:18.58]Welcome, everybody.
[05:22.51]So this is I Spy.
[05:25.23]This game is very old.
[05:27.48]And I don't know, first of all, I skipped the opening cutscene because I had to make sure I could capture the game.
[05:35.02]And what you missed here, a really, really whimsical scenario, I got in the door and closed.
[05:42.94]Boom!
[05:43.75]And there's no handle here.
[05:44.71]I can't open a door with no handle.
[05:45.91]See?
[05:46.17]So I have to finish the puzzle.
[05:48.79]And we got some canes here.
[06:04.20]And here's how you start the game.
[06:05.16]I'm going to click the secret message behind the picture frame.
[06:07.80]Now, this is a celebrated game and a celebrated franchise in a celebrated genre that doesn't exist anymore.
[06:14.54]Well, it does.
[06:16.48]This is probably at least four or five companies that try to scam your grandmother into buying these.
[06:22.07]But I think it's a genre that could do some revitalization.
[06:29.55]Secret message.
[06:30.09]Here we go.
[06:30.47]Alright, it's all the countries in Europe.
[06:33.86]Okay.
[06:34.26]It's, uh, it's, it's, it's Europe.
[06:35.84]It's, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's Africa.
[06:59.95]In the bathroom and by the sink.
[07:03.34]There's a riddle for you to solve, I think.
[07:07.60]Okay, go in the bathroom.
[07:09.38]In the attic, you'll earn this piece.
[07:11.60]Ah, I see.
[07:11.92]But beware.
[07:13.19]The riddle is fun, but it's dark up there.
[07:16.61]So we'll just go left to right, you know?
[07:19.99]I'm not gonna go right to left.
[07:21.29]What is this, a manga?
[07:23.90]Alright, let's go to the bathroom.
[07:25.40]Okay.
[07:25.68]So, in the bathroom by the sink.
[07:27.62]There's a riddle.
[07:28.70]Oh, there's a mouse here.
[07:32.13]Mouse?
[07:32.51]Secret mouse click?
[07:33.07]That has to be something weird, right?
[07:52.30]This is an old game.
[07:53.26]They hid stuff like under the umbrella.
[07:56.14]Dog cane.
[07:57.50]Regular cane.
[07:59.46]Golf club.
[08:01.95]Candy cane.
[08:02.83]I don't know.
[08:04.57]How do I go anywhere?
[08:12.29]How do I leave?
[08:15.46]Oh, like that.
[08:18.02]Okay, hold on.
[08:18.42]There's a cat on the stairs.
[08:22.23]Cat doesn't do anything.
[08:23.03]This is one of those, uh, singing basses, right?
[08:28.26]Cat?
[08:28.56]Cat?
[08:29.06]Yeah, cat, mouse.
[08:32.86]Squeaky floorboard?
[08:33.60]Where's the bathroom?
[08:40.55]This is like the dining room.
[08:41.51]What's under there?
[08:43.12]Here's a riddle for you to solve.
[08:45.04]Found one.
[08:45.78]Listen to it, then hunt for the items the riddle asks for on this screen.
[08:51.12]I spy a fork face, a tongue, two nails, a face on a coin, and three lizard tails.
[08:59.25]Okay.
[08:59.53]A spider, a screw, two sticks for a drum, a spoonful of bugs, and yum, yum, yum.
[09:09.02]Is that me?
[09:09.48]Is that my reflection?
[09:11.20]Me leaning over the table, just peering down?
[09:13.30]Oh, a puzzle.
[09:14.50]That's my face.
[09:15.18]Okay, I spy a fork face.
[09:21.29]Got it.
[09:24.17]What?
[09:26.49]A tongue.
[09:27.37]Okay, this is the spider yum yum.
[09:28.81]Got it.
[09:37.41]So that wasn't a fork.
[09:38.27]Okay.
[09:38.67]I spy a fork, face, a tongue, two nails, a face on a coin, a spider, a screw, a little yum.
[09:51.59]Okay, there's one yum.
[09:54.79]Alright.
[10:04.91]How many yums do I have to click?
[10:06.07]Three?
[10:09.63]Somebody told me that they remember playing this game.
[10:12.41]Between- they only had 15 minutes at the library and they, like, kept playing this.
[10:17.15]It's the only time they ever were able to play the game.
[10:20.36]That's just a saw, not a screw.
[10:24.00]Is that a screw?
[10:25.80]Oh, the lizard.
[10:29.16]Three lizard tails.
[10:31.71]We have to watch the cutscene for every one.
[10:36.51]Two lizard tails.
[10:38.43]No, that's a snake tail.
[10:39.44]That's not correct.
[10:40.08]Uh, well there's another lizard.
[10:42.24]Can I move it?
[10:43.56]No.
[10:46.74]A face on a coin.
[10:48.02]Alright.
[10:56.61]Where's the tongue?
[11:00.71]Found it!
[11:02.89]A tongue.
[11:06.14]So where's the fork face?
[11:10.32]Two sticks for a drum.
[11:12.30]I see the third lizard.
[11:13.42]Oh, do you?
[11:14.72]Well, I need the lizard tail.
[11:20.48]Where are the two?
[11:22.33]Is it fucking hailing right now outside?
[11:25.19]One nail.
[11:28.65]Got it.
[11:32.87]Three lizard tails.
[11:35.01]I got one yum.
[11:42.21]I need two nails.
[11:44.97]This is a childhood classic, guys.
[11:49.02]Come on.
[11:50.08]I told you.
[11:50.94]You know, this was more highly requested than Warband.
[11:54.02]Can you believe that?
[11:54.64]Yeah, I got that yum.
[11:57.98]Yum, yum.
[12:02.91]I need two nails.
[12:09.01]There it is.
[12:15.53]Two nails.
[12:16.65]I literally can't believe that.
[12:18.93]Well, believe it.
[12:19.91]Okay, a screw and a yum yum yum.
[12:25.08]Where's the screw?
[12:31.66]The screw.
[12:33.66]There's an ear.
[12:35.62]I spy a fork face.
[12:39.40]What the hell is a fork face?
[12:40.94]I'm not even gonna tell anybody it's active.
[12:59.16]That's a face?
[13:02.89]Oh, it is a face.
[13:06.11]He's cheating.
[13:06.73]No, we're playing this together.
[13:07.97]A fork face.
[13:12.33]Oh, there is a yum right there.
[13:13.65]You're right.
[13:14.03]Yum, yum.
[13:17.09]Yum, yum, yum.
[13:21.29]Okay, now I need a screw.
[13:22.46]There's an eye.
[13:34.06]Right there.
[13:34.44]I got it.
[13:34.62]I got it.
[13:34.88]I got it.
[13:35.54]I got it.
[13:35.82]I win.
[13:35.98]That was a lot of fun.
[13:36.90]See, that's me.
[13:39.00]That actually is me.
[13:40.64]Okay.
[13:40.84]I thought I was making a joke, but it actually is me.
[13:47.80]So we got the dinner table one done.
[14:03.31]Let's go put this back in.
[14:10.23]Oh, I didn't listen to the rest of the instructions.
[14:16.89]Pick up your piece.
[14:18.09]Okay, with a blue-green... Alright, I need more.
[14:25.35]Where are you guys getting the who from?
[14:32.41]Behind the mirror.
[14:34.29]To Jerry.
[14:36.11]Oh.
[14:37.83]What are you talking about?
[14:47.84]Are you actually talking about the sound when I go back?
[14:54.02]That can't be what you mean.
[14:56.18]To Jerry.
[14:56.89]That's my name.
[14:59.43]That's short for Jeremiah.
[15:05.40]No, the puzzle piece has a gnome on it.
[15:07.02]Oh.
[15:08.52]A thumb, a four.
[15:10.78]Okay, no chat help this time.
[15:13.13]There's a four right here.
[15:17.37]Okay, where's the thumb?
[15:20.49]No help from chat.
[15:22.02]Get it right.
[15:25.60]It knows my name.
[15:26.38]I know, right?
[15:28.91]By the way, getting this game, I had to purchase this game from... You know, I'm not going to say.
[15:33.58]Because I didn't get this game from, like, Amazon.
[15:36.32]So, I don't want to give, like, advertisements.
[15:40.82]Two keys with three holes.
[15:45.23]Legally, no.
[15:46.27]I bought this very legally.
[15:48.35]Like, I bought this game too legally.
[15:50.27]This one with three holes.
[15:55.35]One key with three holes.
[15:59.35]So where's the other one?
[16:00.63]I need it with three holes.
[16:03.45]There it is.

[23:29.03]Two hooks.
[23:29.73]One, two.
[23:30.13]One hook.
[23:36.78]It's actually pretty amazing that this game was developed, it was like a team of about five or six hundred people, because this is back when each frame had to be frame by frame put together, animated, and each piece was actually framed by, it was like a five or six hundred person project.
[23:52.47]The whole entire game cost about two hundred million dollars.
[23:55.21]It was more, I remember it was a huge deal at the time, because Spider-Man broke the record.
[24:00.65]Remember when Spider-Man 1 came out and it was like a two hundred million dollar budget?
[24:03.89]They passed this game.
[24:06.39]It was, like, 198 million dollars or something.
[24:16.35]Alright, I need a bone that's stone.
[24:27.27]That's where it is.

[29:56.25]What do you think?
[30:02.12]I don't know.
[30:02.70]I thought that was like an intricate conspiracy with this game.
[30:06.40]A dangling spider.
[30:13.44]Okay, I need an old clipper ship.
[30:20.43]You lack critical information.
[30:25.67]This game is hard as fuck.

[31:32.80]I preemptively stated.
[31:34.78]Did we see a bone?
[31:39.74]This streamed comedy has been a 2 out of 10 so far.
[31:52.47]That's better than 1.
[31:53.49]I'm glad you gave me a fucking 2.
[31:57.44]Imagine if it was a 1.

[32:59.79]That could mean anything.
[33:00.67]That doesn't have to mean, like, a skeleton bone.
[33:03.81]Yes, it does.
[33:05.03]What else could it possibly be?
[33:14.10]Oh, it's one of the legs of the chair.

[35:40.88]That's a horseshoe bone.
[35:42.64]That's not a wishbone.
[35:44.32]It's going to be in the tree somewhere.

[36:37.23]I looked over and somebody said Sky Thanos.
[36:40.81]Everything is Thanos.
[36:42.11]We can't keep making Thanos references.
[36:47.17]Okay, to be honest, Thanos references are becoming Mario references of like two years ago.
[36:52.36]Remember I made a fucking Mario reference every single stream for like a year?
[36:56.84]Now Thanos is in every game.
[36:59.46]And there has to be an Infinity War reference now every stream.
[37:07.66]And then it was a WoW reference, right?
[37:09.32]Yep.
[37:10.18]That's true.
[37:10.60]I saw the fly there.
[37:19.22]Morbid.
[37:20.45]That's what gave this game a T rating.
[37:23.67]Wishbone.
[37:36.74]Oh, got a... I kind of want to see this through just to see what happens.
[37:42.21]Why are you playing this game like it's for adults?
[37:45.09]Because it is for adults.

[38:09.70]It's not E for children.
[38:11.50]It's E for everyone.

[45:55.82]You will hit that thing in the face.
[46:00.05]Just because it's demonically possessed doesn't mean shit.
[46:03.88]It still weighs like fucking 1.7 pounds.
[46:06.46]Alright, we gotta go in here.

[47:19.68]This could be anything.
[47:22.48]And yes, I know it says what the moon brought.
[47:25.32]But I, like, I've been holding my fucking hand up this whole time, my thumb out.
[47:30.18]Because, like, I'm just, my screen's, like, fucked up.
[47:33.80]So I've been wiping my screen in the same spot trying to get this dust and scratches off.
[47:38.24]And, like, it's covering up that letter.
[47:42.74]Footprints.
[47:43.52]Okay.

[48:08.70]And just draw, like, cute, fun pictures.
[48:15.82]If you're, like, artistically talented, like, just write a children's book.

[49:26.74]This will be my real, actual book.
[49:30.77]He's so spiteful.
[49:34.31]No, I'm just... Alright, I gotta think of a good fucking story.
[49:37.53]Let's get some inspiration.
[49:38.49]How about a doll that comes to life to, like, kill you?
[49:42.44]And, like, it's some fucking, like, kid with a bat.
[49:45.29]And the whole thing is the doll, like, peeking around corners and finding him, and finally, like, the kid does a full wind-up and hits the doll in the fucking mouth with the baseball bat.
[49:53.33]And, like, the ending frame is, like, the whole family, like, having dinner, and they're all happy.
[49:57.07]Oh, no, it's supposed to be a children's book.
[50:00.29]Children's book.
[50:01.43]So, uh, Detective Teddy, the... Teddy's turmoil, and it's like, oh, no, he didn't take a bath today.

[50:31.74]Bathtime shenanigans or whatever.
[50:33.99]It could be anything.
[50:39.47]Okay, I need to beat this game.
[50:48.16]That's called plagiarism.
[50:49.50]No, it's not!
[50:50.98]If it's original.
[50:51.90]I'm gonna make it original.
[50:52.80]It'll be so original.
[50:56.28]Okay, I need a foot with no toes.
[51:03.31]This shit's gonna sell so many copies.
[51:06.75]Laugh now, but this will be in the front of every Barnes & Noble.
[51:10.75]It'll be a- it'll sweep the nation.
[51:20.12]Alright, I need, um, this is getting hard.
[51:23.70]An eye back in place.
[51:29.32]An eye back in place.
[51:31.61]Here comes a coffee, but imagine if I got, like, fucking sued.
[51:34.29]Imagine I wrote a book and I didn't realize because, like, everybody's written a story about some random stuffy, fluffy character that, like, has trouble eating vegetables and, like, I get sued and I go to court and I lose everything.
[51:49.40]That would be... That would probably be fucking hilarious.
[51:53.74]That's like the only way I would ever accept, like, literally, like, my career, like, my stream, YouTube, whatever.
[51:59.39]It was all taken from me because I, like, plagiarized a children's book.
[52:03.65]Like, on accident.
[52:14.13]That's not a porcelain hand?
[52:17.97]A porcelain head, oh.
[52:23.91]Local streamer throws away his livelihood, too.
[52:26.12]One up for one guy.
[52:27.48]This way, we're gonna fucking write it, man.
[52:31.74]It's gonna be like, not, it's gonna be like ten pages long.
[52:41.08]A needle.
[52:43.22]Anybody see a needle?
[52:50.72]No, it's going to be so original that there's no way anyone would take it.
[52:55.28]Three bows, a face with no eyes.
[52:57.06]A face with no eyes.
[53:00.61]No, that's... Where's a face with no eyes?
[53:11.31]Oh, a cloak!
[53:12.71]It's the cloak.
[53:15.96]It's going to be so original, no one's going to publish it.
[53:20.40]We'll get in, like, paint, and I'll make all the panels.
[53:22.52]A foot with no toes.
[53:29.58]Doesn't that count?
[53:33.32]How does that not count?
[53:40.65]A foot with no toes.
[53:41.97]It's a ruler!
[53:42.97]A foot with no toes.
[53:52.02]Animals have paws, not feet.
[53:56.24]Semantics.
[53:56.74]Alright, now we need footprints.
[53:58.84]This is all like the foot stuff.
[54:00.08]Footprints.
[54:00.68]Foot.
[54:01.20]Foot.
[54:01.62]Feet.
[54:06.48]Footprints.
[54:09.02]Where are they? ...
[54:22.14]And then says the guy that foot paw, it's not paw print, it's foot print.
[54:26.22]And that's clearly a paw.
[54:28.40]And then I got, I got yelled at because I said feet are paws.
[54:37.96]Unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable.
[54:41.46]A needle, three bows.
[54:50.44]Three bows.
[54:52.40]There's one.
[54:54.06]There's two.
[54:54.92]One bow.
[54:59.44]Two bows.
[55:02.29]Three bow.
[55:05.25]Three bow.
[55:08.01]One bow.
[55:08.53]Two bows.
[55:09.09]Like a bow and arrow.
[55:10.13]Like a bow.
[55:10.63]They're throwing me under the bus here.
[55:19.03]Bow?
[55:21.91]Oh.
[55:26.49]And then I need to find Nado.
[55:29.05]I need to find Nado.
[55:34.39]Oh, that's a nice sword.
[55:39.70]It's named Nado.
[55:42.64]God, that shell sucks now.
[55:49.22]A foot with no toes.
[55:57.82]Oh fuck, there it is.
[56:06.42]People are wondering what I'm talking about.
[56:07.68]I'm talking about Game of Thrones.
[56:09.72]I think it's alright.
[56:26.18]Yeah, Game of Thrones.
[56:28.47]Still, no, it's still watchable.
[56:31.69]But, I mean, can you blame him?
[56:34.35]The guy was supposed to write the next book and just went to, like, conventions for five years.
[56:42.72]Like, the Winds of Winter is never releasing.
[56:45.28]Everybody needs to know that.
[56:46.52]You gotta come to terms with it.
[56:51.68]He was just, like, living the life.
[56:56.82]Like, I love that series.
[56:58.86]I've read all the books.
[56:59.74]It's, like, one of my favorite series ever.
[57:02.90]But I think I'd have to come to terms with the fact that, like, HBO is just going to finish that story.
[57:12.21]And I'm one of those, like, bitter, annoying book fans that's like, no, the show's not good enough.
[57:16.42]It's just a good book.
[57:17.40]I like the books better.
[57:28.05]They're literally finishing it in April.
[57:29.91]Yeah.
[57:31.17]And there's still two more books that apparently have to come out for the actual, like, story to be done.
[57:39.32]Shit.
[57:40.62]Books on a shelf.
[57:44.28]You never read them.
[57:45.10]Yeah, what?
[57:48.32]No, you know why you think I never read them?
[57:49.80]I'll tell you one very specific reason why.
[57:52.16]Because I've read all the books.
[57:55.18]And that was, like, in 2011.
[57:59.18]It's almost, it's 2019.
[58:02.67]The last book came out before some of you guys were even born.
[58:10.43]Pick up your piece and put it... Some of you guys are like nine, you know what I mean?
[58:29.10]Can I solve the... What's his name?
[58:31.34]Pat, can I solve the puzzle?
[58:34.46]To get out, are you ready now?
[58:35.56]And that's just to show you how.
[58:36.57]With a bug on the... In.
[58:40.59]Books on the string.
[58:41.61]With a... Thomas Jefferson.
[58:43.55]This order blue... Alright.
[58:45.07]I gotta go back up.
[58:55.99]Bathroom?
[58:59.90]Ooh, nice.
[59:00.96]Okay.
[59:01.84]Oh, that's gonna be hard.
[59:08.15]Do I read a lot?
[59:08.71]No, not really.
[59:09.21]I'll, you know...
[59:28.56]All wise cracks aside.
[59:31.02]No, not anymore.
[59:31.66]I used to read all the time.
[59:36.50]Go tea back in its place.
[59:39.54]A tea back in place.
[59:45.02]Okay.
[59:46.51]Skeet?
[59:49.29]What?
[59:49.93]Why?
[59:50.21]Huh?
[59:50.95]Uh-huh.
[59:58.04]I spy a ladder!
[59:59.08]We found it!
[60:06.43]This game came out before that song even came out, so give them a break.
[60:12.81]The Winner's Cup.
[60:18.57]The Winner's Cup.
[60:19.29]That's not a Winner's Cup.
[60:28.54]For a second, I thought this was a book.
[60:31.13]I'm like, yeah.
[60:33.49]There's a lot of those.
[60:35.89]Where's the winner's cup?
[60:37.55]No, no.
[60:40.21]This is a perfect opportunity.
[60:41.89]You guys are going to make a perfect joke here.
[60:43.75]I don't know what a winner's cup looks like because I've never won anything and I've never come in first place.
[60:49.81]There's the joke.
[60:51.57]Come on.
[60:54.77]I thought you guys were better than that.
[60:59.54]Gyroscope is here.
[61:03.38]A gyroscope.
[61:09.53]And a bug crawling up.
[61:12.39]No.
[61:13.13]No.
[61:14.05]Bug crawling up.
[61:22.47]What does that mean?
[61:29.37]I just had to click it again just to know what it felt like to hold it.
[61:35.32]A bug crawling up.
[61:37.40]A waxy mouse head.
[61:38.68]A backwards book.
[61:42.74]A waxy mouse head.
[61:44.46]It's this one.
[61:45.24]A backwards book.
[61:48.30]Oh, Shido!
[61:51.02]A rat eye that's red.
[61:52.30]That's it.
[61:56.28]A rat eye that's red.
[62:01.65]Skito.
[62:01.89]Thanks.
[62:02.23]Chito's evil twin.
[62:03.03]Skito.
[62:03.31]I got a magnifying glass?
[62:28.70]A lightning bolt, an old gravestone, a water drop, swamp, three nails, a face made of spots, and two yellow tails.
[62:40.46]Okay, a spider, a feather, a bone.
[62:44.81]Oh, look at that.
[62:46.31]This is interesting.
[62:47.51]An old gravestone.
[62:48.97]Now this is interesting, guys.
[62:50.89]This is where it becomes a little fun here.
[62:56.59]Look at that horse.
[62:59.41]You know?
[62:59.73]Okay, I spy... Eek!
[63:15.59]Sucks?
[63:16.29]No.
[63:21.17]Oh, yikes!
[63:21.95]Ugh.
[63:30.24]Okay, let's see.
[63:31.16]A water drop?
[63:32.88]Swomp.
[63:39.24]If you look carefully, you can see the copyright infringement.
[63:41.66]Where?
[63:53.79]I'm sorry.
[63:54.07]I couldn't move for a second.
[63:54.93]I'm sorry.
[63:55.27]That was weird.
[63:58.37]Okay, a feather.
[64:01.45]Right there.
[64:05.34]Is this all we're playing tonight?
[64:06.46]No.
[64:07.46]We're doing this and I'm going to write a children's book on stream.
[64:12.14]And I'm going to draw out the panels and pages.
[64:18.55]Okay, three nails.
[64:20.35]Do I really need to zoom in for this?
[64:21.59]One nail.
[64:31.88]A water drop Two nails Two nails a water drop three nails.
[64:42.57]I need three nails.
[64:43.83]Where's the other nail?
[64:45.75]Get out of here.
[64:47.79]I Can't do this with you looking over my shoulder like this Two nails
[64:59.80]Three nails.
[65:03.32]A face made of spots.
[65:06.14]It's not this one?
[65:07.92]It's not this one?
[65:10.47]Robot?
[65:13.13]Uh... One yellow tail.
[65:16.37]Okay.
[65:20.89]Okay, that's fine.
[65:22.59]Uh, I spy a spider.
[65:26.59]The fuck?
[65:28.03]Oh, right there.
[65:29.65]Get off of him!
[65:30.91]A spider.
[65:35.80]Um... A face made of spots and two yellow tails.
[65:40.04]There's another one.
[65:43.60]Two yellow tails.
[65:48.38]Scream.
[65:52.77]Um... Oh!
[65:57.63]No, that's not a face.
[66:00.13]That's a fish.
[66:03.43]There's a face made of spots, right?
[66:04.99]There's Mickey.
[66:10.28]There's a bone.
[66:15.18]Oh, everybody, right now, I want everyone to do your best Mickey Mouse impression, out loud.
[66:19.22]Three, two, one, go.
[66:22.68]Okay, kids, that's why we're gonna be...
[66:25.49]Uh, kind of sounding really weird in the New Kingdom Hearts game for some reason.
[66:29.44]Sounds just like this.
[66:31.90]Every scene sounds like they're kind of lying down on a bed, reading a newspaper.
[66:36.34]Okay, a face made of spots.
[66:54.35]That's a face right there.
[66:55.33]It just is.
[67:00.50]Oh my god, it was right there.
[67:01.58]Oh my god, it was right there.
[67:02.48]Oh my god, it was right there.
[67:14.28]That's a face, eyes, mouth, beard.
[67:29.57]How is that not it?
[67:32.97]Scream.
[67:35.35]No, I don't... Are you serious?
[67:43.04]That's a face?
[67:46.38]That's like Ronald McDonald.
[67:48.80]I guess that's like a face.
[67:51.62]Could be.
[67:55.10]Pull.
[67:57.24]Find three, pull.
[67:59.06]Ronald McDonald does have a face.
[68:06.38]If it's underneath makeup, that doesn't... Come on, that doesn't count.
[68:10.20]He has a mask on.
[68:11.82]He's wearing a clown nose, his regular nose.
[68:13.52]That's not a person's nose.
[68:14.80]That's not a face.
[68:16.46]His face is underneath that material.
[68:19.27]Say it with me now.
[68:20.99]His face is underneath the material.
[68:23.91]Which is not a face.
[68:25.51]It's material.
[68:37.50]Almost done.
[68:44.99]Now we just gotta put in Nevada.
[68:46.65]There it is.
[68:48.80]One, two, three, only four more games to play.
[68:57.95]There's still so much to explore up here.
[69:05.63]Did I go in here?
[69:06.39]I don't think I went in here.
[69:08.12]Yeah, I did.
[69:10.06]Anything else I didn't do in here?
[69:11.62]I went in the wardrobe.
[69:16.38]I spy a bar of soap, a toothbrush, a trap, a silver handle, a brown bottle cap, a grip on a pole, a square picture frame, two jacks, a nine, and a candle flame.
[69:35.37]Those are huge flies.
[69:37.65]Just wanna make sure everyone's aware.
[69:42.75]Just in case you weren't.
[69:44.27]Alright, so we got, ah, no, that's too easy to say that.
[69:48.67]I was gonna say fruit punch.
[69:52.67]That's, okay, me saying, oh, look, fruit punch, mm, sip, yummy.
[69:55.90]That's me just reaching to say anything about an object that's here, you know what I mean?
[70:00.60]That's actually me like, what's that?
[70:02.50]Okay, what's in there?
[70:03.28]What could be in there?
[70:03.98]Oh, is that funny?
[70:04.50]Say it.
[70:05.15]No, I'm not gonna go for that one.
[70:07.83]Coca-Cola classic, though, you know what I'm saying?
[70:15.99]A trap.
[70:20.97]A silver handle.
[70:31.51]A toothbrush.
[70:37.02]Sellout.
[70:40.66]Here's the number six.
[70:42.88]Well, it was nine, but then it flipped into six.
[70:45.98]A grip on a pole.
[70:49.21]Like that, right there.
[70:51.95]A grip on a pole.
[71:00.30]That's weird.
[71:00.74]That is something there, yeah.
[71:05.32]Pig?
[71:05.70]Is it pig something?
[71:07.18]Candle flame.
[71:07.88]Yeah, right there.
[71:09.62]A candle flame.
[71:15.31]Two jacks.
[71:18.11]Jacks.
[71:20.77]Two jacks.
[71:24.41]Jack.
[71:26.85]Square picture frame.
[71:27.95]A square picture frame.
[71:29.33]Where's the Jack?
[71:30.97]Snail.
[71:36.25]These are jacks.
[71:41.71]One Jack.
[71:44.13]Two jacks.
[71:45.32]This is making references to an old game that people used to play in their garage.
[71:50.98]Right?
[71:51.16]Nobody plays with jacks anymore.
[71:58.09]Silver handle, a brown bottle cap.
[72:02.29]Silver handle.
[72:06.61]Hmm.
[72:16.03]Jerry.
[72:19.25]Silver handle.
[72:22.33]Fuck.
[72:25.43]It's not the door handle.
[72:28.86]A bar of soap.
[72:30.64]In the tub?
[72:31.82]No.
[72:35.34]A bar of soap.
[72:36.46]I used to put jacks under my parents' tires.
[72:40.22]Why would you do that?
[72:46.17]That sounds very, very bad.
[72:52.88]Why?
[72:54.30]Causing damage to your parents' automobiles?
[73:06.81]Brown bottle cap.
[73:08.95]Silver handle.
[73:12.53]Silver handle.
[73:15.54]I clicked that.
[73:17.66]I clicked that.
[73:18.44]I went like this.
[73:21.10]Okay, brown bottle cap.
[73:32.69]No.
[73:39.19]Brown bottle cap.
[73:55.17]Do you see this shit?
[73:55.87]I don't see it.
[73:56.37]I see teeth.
[74:14.58]What is the face on the wall?
[74:15.78]Yeah, just kind of painted there.
[74:31.91]Bottle cap is almost as big as the sink.
[74:35.67]How many pieces have you gotten from me?
[74:38.64]Here is a hint.
[74:39.88]It's 15 minus 3.
[74:40.76]14, 13.
[74:41.20]It's 12!
[74:41.72]It's 12, mummy!
[75:00.56]Alright, to get out.
[75:07.22]Are you ready?
[75:08.32]Look at his message to show you how.
[75:12.48]Green light with the spider on the... I can't do it yet.
[75:17.71]I don't know.
[75:26.03]Just burn this house down.
[75:29.17]I need to get the treasure first.
[75:31.26]That's funny.
[75:31.78]Okay, well... A skate.
[75:58.47]Get the bat.
[76:00.71]Swing as hard as you can.
[76:03.41]You're looking for, like, shrapnel.
[76:06.87]Annabelle's coming at you.
[76:07.85]Alright, what am I doing?
[76:13.23]Let us click.
[76:21.34]You guys wanna play?
[76:23.00]Okay, I'm gonna give you guys one chance.
[76:26.02]Good luck.
[76:39.15]Give me the controller.
[76:40.75]Okay, what is it, a cage?
[76:46.48]He wants to play on the dark level.
[76:53.68]Nice, nice.
[76:55.44]This is nothing.
[76:56.10]What is this?
[77:00.76]I always just did that.
[77:03.56]Cat?
[77:03.90]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[77:04.43]Everyone clicks on the weird thing or the cat.
[77:08.97]Like, 30% of you aren't even playing.
[77:10.83]You're just clicking on the fun thing.
[77:19.52]Use a hint.
[77:25.24]No, we're gonna go hintless.
[77:27.52]Alright, thanks for the help, guys.
[77:29.00]But I mean, like, clearly... Clearly, I can do this.
[77:35.04]A wooden chair.
[77:42.28]A candle.
[77:45.52]A black picture frame.
[77:49.07]I have no idea.
[77:50.09]I don't know.
[77:52.77]I have no idea.
[77:53.83]A cage.
[77:57.51]A bat.
[77:58.71]Wait, where is the bat?
[77:59.93]There's a bat and a doll.
[78:13.30]Give the controller back to your little brother.
[78:16.98]No.
[78:21.60]It's my turn on the Xbox.
[78:24.08]No.
[78:25.50]That's why we have two different consoles.
[78:28.06]I have the Xbox, you have the PlayStation 3.
[78:31.89]So we can get in arguments about which console is better on the walk home from school.
[78:39.17]That's how you have good, healthy competition with your kids.
[78:42.13]34 years old, by the way.
[78:56.63]No, I'm not.
[78:57.17]That's not true.
[78:57.69]That's a lie.
[78:59.17]Don't listen to that person.
[79:00.41]That's wrong.
[79:02.65]I turned 34 this year, but this hasn't happened yet.
[79:05.01]That's wrong.

[80:02.77]Yeah, I can't even make that joke because of Infinity War spoilers.
[80:06.15]I was gonna say something really funny.
[80:08.19]I was gonna say something really funny about people owning the Thanos box.
[80:17.43]Where's the other snake?
[80:28.03]Guys, people got angry at me for spoiling Home Alone.
[80:31.35]Like, I can't talk about movies anymore.
[80:33.25]Is this a snake?
[80:47.48]No, that's not the snake.
[80:53.35]Oh, thank you.
[80:54.23]Thank you, 5%.
[81:00.07]What happens at the end of Home Alone?
[81:01.77]Does the kid... No, no.
[81:05.00]No, I can neither confirm nor deny what happens at the end of any feature film, okay?
[81:12.63]Here's piece 13.
[81:14.53]There's no doubt.
[81:16.25]You're about to find the secret way out.
[81:30.37]Oh my god.
[81:31.17]Oh my god, that was fucking horrible.
[81:33.31]That's just...
[81:38.98]That was fucking horrible.
[81:51.61]I can't even address what I just read.
[81:52.95]Alright, what's the secret message?
[82:12.18]Okay, I just laughed really hard, really quickly.
[82:15.19]And I need a minute, because I almost just, like, fucking fell over.
[82:24.95]Jesus Christ.
[82:25.93]Somebody said something about a cinder block, and it was fucking horrible, and I had... That's all I'm going to say.
[82:38.14]This is a PG-13, family-friendly, E-rated stream.
[82:41.06]double double toil and trouble solve the riddle where pots of stew bubble kitchen where's it where's the kitchen kitchen there's the kitchen

[83:36.19]Sometimes I look over and, like, something is said and it throws me off forever.
[83:42.81]This is the Dreamcast sucks laughing my ass off comment all over again.
[83:51.98]Why would you keep a hot dog in a jar?
[83:53.94]That's like a ballpark Frank, by the way.
[83:57.90]With the fake grill marks on it.
[84:08.08]A bug in a spoon.
[84:09.44]Ew, return it!
[84:12.40]A bug in a spoon.
[84:21.47]I spy spice.
[84:23.55]Where's the spice?
[84:25.85]Ooh, spice.

[84:47.19]A knife.
[84:50.57]Streamer refuses to eat Frank on stream.
[84:56.08]No.
[84:58.38]Did we ever talk about the hot dog eating competition caught by Ashley versus the bear?
[85:04.90]We've done that.
[85:05.32]We've talked about that, right?
[85:10.90]No.
[85:11.44]No, we haven't.
[85:12.96]It's like one of the funniest goddamn things.
[85:15.55]So, uh, you know the hot dog eating champion, right?
[85:20.45]So, this guy, if you don't know who Kobayashi is, he could eat like 75 hot dogs.
[85:27.81]in like 10 minutes.
[85:29.99]It's ridiculous.
[85:30.71]It's the Coney Island hot dog eating competition.
[85:33.72]And they did this segment.
[85:35.34]There was this old show called like Man vs. Beast or something like that.
[85:41.28]And one of the segments, they had like people that were extraordinary at certain things go up against animals.
[85:46.89]And this one segment, Kobayashi, they brought him in to do a hot dog eating contest versus a bear.
[85:54.36]And it was supposed to be like this huge deal where Kobayashi, can he out eat a fucking grizzly bear in 25 seconds?
[86:02.75]And you're thinking, oh, this is going to be interesting.
[86:05.56]It's not at all.
[86:06.46]What happens is Kobayashi is like mowing down these hot dogs at two a second, like drinking water and sucking them down as fast as he can.
[86:14.42]And the bear doesn't give a shit.
[86:15.64]The bear doesn't know it's a competition.
[86:17.62]So he doesn't care.
[86:18.85]The bear like Winnie the Pooh moseys over to the hot dogs.
[86:22.21]There's like probably a hundred hot dogs laid out in front of this bear.
[86:25.83]And the bear just is like sniffing them and there's a timer and there's commentary and shit.
[86:30.47]And the bear is just like, like tilts his head over and like sucks one up whole.
[86:37.74]And then like starts smelling him again.
[86:39.24]I think the bear only eats like fucking seven hot dogs.
[86:45.01]He doesn't give a shit.
[86:46.01]And Kobayashi eats like 60.
[86:48.73]And they thought it was going to be like good television.
[86:52.83]I got to like fucking find this right now and put it on stream.
[86:58.43]tilts his head and like the thing is the bear knew it was a competition he would eat a hundred hot dogs in like five seconds let's see Kobayashi versus bear there it is yeah and they got the Bruce Buffer to do like the fucking intro and they have the bear like scream
[87:27.24]Oh, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I'll see you in about five seconds when I get this on stream.
[87:32.04]We're gonna watch this whole thing.
[87:36.61]I remember when this first aired, I remember fucking laughing my ass off.
[87:44.49]It was like the funniest fucking thing I'd ever seen.
[87:47.30]Well, let's watch it.
[87:48.66]The quality is so low.
[87:59.26]Alright, here we go.
[88:00.84]See, he's like prepared.
[88:01.72]He's coming in like strong, like doing like training.
[88:03.83]He's got his water there, like all these hot dogs.
[88:05.69]He's ready.
[88:08.06]And now introducing to my right, his opponent, the Beast.
[88:12.80]He descends from Kodiak Island, Alaska.
[88:16.08]Fully erect, this beast stands over eight feet tall.
[88:19.66]Do the roar.
[88:20.38]He weighs in tonight at 1,089 pounds.
[88:24.12]He can digest over 60 pounds of food in a 24-hour period.
[88:30.00]But he doesn't know it's a competition.
[88:32.24]For destruction, meet the Beast, the Alaskan.
[88:39.71]He has no fucking idea to go with these hot dogs or yummy and the contest begins as soon as the bear eats the first As many as he can as well the bear is going for it as well look at that
[88:56.34]No hands for the bear.
[88:57.50]Look at Kobayashi staring at the bear.
[88:58.80]Look at Kobayashi watching his opponent.
[89:00.20]Now, I wonder if it's the same feeling when he's in a competition with a human being.
[89:03.88]Steve, I gotta say something.
[89:05.06]When the bear came out, I saw a flash of fear for a second in Kobayashi's eyes because he's never faced it at a competition like this.
[89:13.03]It's unbelievable.
[89:14.41]Look at how many hot dogs Kobayashi has left.
[89:17.81]I don't see how he can beat this bear.
[89:20.67]You got to remember, Kobayashi is an eating machine.
[89:24.08]He's got a formula down where he just goes, never takes a break.
[89:27.32]He's steady.
[89:28.08]Right, and he also, as you can see, Michael, he has the water there because his mouth gets dry and it helps him digest the hot dogs.
[89:34.78]Well, Kobayashi is the greatest professional eater in the world.
[89:37.52]He's got this eating technique.
[89:38.70]Who thought this was a good idea?
[89:40.22]It's one minute into the competition now.
[89:42.38]Kobayashi's doing very well.
[89:43.52]The bear.
[89:44.04]Did I misremember this?
[90:05.73]and look at the size of the bear.
[90:07.59]You know, I was really impressed when Kobayashi first came out.
[90:10.33]He's in great shape.
[90:11.57]You can tell he's an athlete.
[90:12.78]He's got great biceps, and he came out with a small stomach.
[90:16.52]He won't leave with one, but he's a fabulous-looking athlete.
[90:20.08]Two minutes into the competition, Kobayashi is watching that bear like a hawk.
[90:23.96]That bear is definitely going through
[90:26.38]The hot dogs Michael he is he is he's making a strong lead.
[90:29.64]I can't abandon that dish I guess he is and I cannot count them from the angle that I'm at right now No, he doesn't win.
[90:35.42]He is in the lead.
[90:36.24]It looks like no, he doesn't win winner very shortly The bear is now looking at Kobayashi if you believe that exactly he's being distracted.
[90:44.07]This is what Kobayashi hasn't missed the beat There's only maybe six seven hot dogs left and there it goes.
[90:51.39]Oh my god.
[90:51.91]There's only three hot dogs
[90:53.47]That was... Ow!
[90:54.49]What the fuck?
[90:55.65]No!
[90:55.87]He's down.
[90:56.39]I thought he was... I got that so wrong.
[91:20.75]Alright, I'm here with Steve Martin, the bear handler.
[91:23.49]Did you have any doubt?
[91:25.21]Well, you know, when a bear comes in, this bear is really hungry.
[91:28.65]So when they come in like that, they're going to chow right down.
[91:32.07]But I have to give it to him.
[91:33.37]He really did a good job on keeping up with the bear.
[91:35.93]It was a real close race.
[91:37.65]Were you afraid at all?
[91:39.15]No, the best part.
[91:40.01]No, seriously.
[91:40.69]Okay, so he said the bear has six or seven hot dogs left.
[91:49.58]And I'm remembering from, like, two decades ago that he only ate seven.
[91:54.36]But the point still stands.
[91:55.60]Like, watch what happens from the bear.
[91:56.82]The bear, the first hot dog that he eats is just so stupid.
[92:02.11]He just, like, sneaks over and it's like, oh.
[92:04.65]He, like, tilts his head to the side.
[92:06.07]He eats it.
[92:06.61]Oh, it's so funny.
[92:07.43]It's like this.
[92:07.83]Oh.
[92:18.42]I so poorly misremembered that, but that makes it funnier to me.
[92:22.74]Ugh.
[92:28.46]Old TV was so dumb.
[92:31.06]You know how much that segment probably cost?
[92:35.92]Old shows back in like the late 90s, early 2000s, man, they used to just throw piss money into the garbage can.
[92:42.62]Oh my god.
[92:49.55]fully erect large bear.
[92:51.19]I don't even know how we got there, but we did.
[93:03.03]That's one of my favorite television segments.
[93:06.34]Now I got a fucking headache.
[93:14.78]Oh, the bear only eats like seven hot dogs.
[93:17.98]Oh, he eats them all, actually.
[93:20.09]All of them.
[93:21.95]Handrail.
[93:22.67]Alright.
[93:29.86]Wait, what am I getting linked here?
[93:41.16]What?
[93:41.44]That face is so ugly.
[93:44.61]Look at this shit.
[93:47.68]Where did this even come from?
[93:48.86]When did I do this?
[93:49.80]I don't even look human in this photo.
[94:08.87]Hold on, look.
[94:13.45]I don't even look human.
[94:16.66]I look like, anybody ever have a gerbil?
[94:20.62]Or a hamster?
[94:22.80]Remember they used to just stuff shit in their mouth?
[94:25.72]And hide it in their cheeks?
[94:29.15]I don't, that doesn't even look like the same person.
[94:30.99]That doesn't look like Jeremy Elbertson.
[94:32.63]That's not even me.
[94:40.02]You look like a Bogdanoff.
[94:58.14]What the fuck?
[95:03.29]Ugh.
[95:07.91]Alright, uh, hidden object game.
[95:10.47]Uh... But that was like Man vs. Beast or whatever the hell it was.
[95:16.94]They had so many dumb shows like that.
[95:22.44]Yeah, well, the thing is, he was really hungry.
[95:28.19]Shape of a moon.
[95:30.89]Big bits.
[95:31.39]Oh, shit.
[95:31.87]I missed them.

[96:17.29]That's a huge amount of money.

[101:04.06]Oh, four.
[101:06.94]Watch out, watch out, a shadow to the left.
[101:18.01]No, it was just so extreme.

[102:12.13]Where's the other horns?
[102:21.10]No.
[102:28.67]Whoa.
[102:30.47]What is that?
[102:30.95]Two horns.
[102:32.47]Oh!
[102:34.01]They mean literal horns.
[102:42.52]So where's the last one?
[102:44.26]Where's the upside-down one?
[102:45.36]I feel like the upside-down one's gonna be hard to find.
[102:50.80]There's the key.
[102:55.08]A key?
[102:56.21]He has two.
[102:58.19]I thought she said two horns.
[103:02.98]Three horns.
[103:05.02]I thought she was talking about two horns.
[103:07.92]I thought actually she meant you found two here.
[103:11.75]It's because I had one.
[103:12.93]Where's the upside down one?
[103:24.39]There it is.
[103:29.81]Crack.
[103:34.35]If I was a crack, what would I be?
[103:40.91]That?
[103:41.21]That's a crack right there.
[103:53.63]Alright, it's time to solve the whole thing.
[103:55.39]I'm done.
[104:01.31]That sounds pretty good to me.
[104:06.09]Let's decode the message.
[104:23.98]Okay, here we go.
[104:30.87]D plus ear.
[104:34.17]Dear... No, I wanted to do this.
[104:37.98]I wrote this message to show you how.
[104:44.16]Go to the room with a spider on the ceiling.
[104:47.56]Spider on the ceiling.
[104:48.38]Find a door I've been concealing.
[104:51.20]Spider on the ceiling.

[105:10.62]Find three books on a shelf with white...
[105:15.97]head.
[105:18.45]Then pull blue, green, red.

[105:22.03]I don't know.
[105:22.55]What the hell?
[105:23.33]How am I going to get out of here?
[105:37.68]Found it.
[105:40.54]Okay.
[105:40.74]Here we go.
[105:53.17]You did it.
[105:53.63]Well, that was a fun game.
