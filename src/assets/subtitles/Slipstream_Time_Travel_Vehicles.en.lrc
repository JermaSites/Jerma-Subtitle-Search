[00:08.97]So we're gonna do Righteous Air.
[00:11.09]Vote for Righteous Air.
[00:14.01]Make sure we get the right amount of votes.
[00:16.85]Okay.
[00:18.65]We got the guy with the 3D glasses down in the lower right.
[00:22.30]What?
[00:22.98]No, no.
[00:23.58]Red and green, that's not even like 3D glasses.
[00:25.84]They're in blue.
[00:27.02]Oh yeah.
[00:27.66]This guy's just a tool.
[00:33.52]You like this paint job?
[00:35.69]Why is your name so big?
[00:39.57]Why isn't that much real estate on the screen?
[00:41.97]I want to land on you.
[00:44.79]Oh my god.
[00:48.61]I love how we're both doing stupid spins.
[00:56.61]Oh, wow, this is shit.
[00:59.51]This is on the moon, apparently.
[01:03.05]We were in the air for so long, gravity wasn't even a thing.
[01:05.83]I'm so far behind you guys.
[01:07.22]Hold on, I want to see where you are.
[01:09.20]I'm apparently an expert.
[01:11.98]I can't even... I can't see.
[01:13.32]There's a giant no-smoking sign in my face when I do that.
[01:17.56]Star, fuck you.
[01:19.10]You missed, dammit, no.
[01:21.18]I'm using the thing that makes it glow.
[01:23.10]Go through like the teleporter.
[01:25.32]I don't have enough points.
[01:26.50]I thought you said to do that!
[01:27.46]You have to press space when you have enough meter.
[01:30.25]You see your meter on the side, you idiot!
[01:32.49]Learn to play Carnage Racing, I gotta play MBM!
[01:40.31]I picked something up, I hit F, and I'm in first!
[01:42.70]I won a missile!
[01:45.30]That didn't do anything to you!
[01:47.20]No, I'm fine!
[01:48.32]That didn't do anything.
[01:49.66]That did not do anything to me.
[01:51.36]I even set up my screen that I nailed you, and I didn't even wanna.
[01:56.43]How did you just win?
[01:59.43]You won?
[02:02.47]I-I... What the fuck just happened to me?!
[02:09.52]I don't know, you cheated!
[02:10.82]I was ahead of you, and you just, like, lagged.
[02:13.90]Alright, I'm voting for and back again.
[02:17.02]Way to go, sugar!
[02:18.26]I wish- I wish I had, like, a face cam on right now, and my hands are like-
[02:23.72]So, I'm getting really confused right now.
[02:25.64]Your name is purple, my car is purple, and it's freaking me out.
[02:29.16]I feel like I should be over there.
[02:31.10]I feel like that's, like, my name floating above you.
[02:34.51]Maybe it is.
[02:36.13]What do you mean, maybe?
[02:36.97]Oh, this is a time travel game.
[02:38.87]I just hit you with something, Jerma, and it did nothing.
[02:43.11]I'm gonna land on top of Star... Nope, missed.
[02:46.95]Well, yeah, you have, like, the unlockable car.
[02:50.07]It's not unlockable, what are you talking about?
[02:51.90]Yeah, right.
[02:52.34]You, like, you do, like, download that for, like, $4.99.
[02:55.72]I don't even... I, uh... Mela's just, like, in the back.
[03:01.68]I landed on the side, and it just, I just started sliding into the water.
[03:06.17]Oh, baby.
[03:08.15]Oh, baby, baby.
[03:09.09]You just got Blastoised.
[03:13.95]You just got totally Blastoised.
[03:19.05]Alright, so how do I go through the super time travel thing?
[03:21.43]Space.
[03:22.71]Okay, oh!
[03:23.61]Ooh!
[03:24.15]Ooh!
[03:25.37]No!
[03:25.85]It does nothing though, don't worry.
[03:27.97]It does!
[03:28.91]It does!
[03:29.53]You have to go to one of the rocks.
[03:33.16]So this whole game's mechanic is based on teleporting in front of each other.
[03:38.20]Yes.
[03:38.36]Yeah, basically.
[03:39.70]What the fuck is that?
[03:41.99]Oh, yeah, let's make a game.
[03:43.05]Let's make a racing game where you just, like, teleport in front of each other.
[03:47.25]The track doesn't even matter.
[03:48.67]Look.
[03:50.41]Oh, second place would be, like, fly in front of everybody.
[03:54.01]How did you get up there?
[03:57.10]I feel like you're angry.
[03:59.37]Oh, that's fine.
[04:00.27]That's fine.
[04:00.69]Like, you think you're gonna win, is what this is right now.
[04:03.39]Well, I think I'm going to fucking teleport in front of you right now.
[04:07.57]Because, like, here I am.
[04:09.05]Hi.
[04:10.29]Hi, Star.
[04:11.47]Is that in front of me?
[04:12.53]Do you know what in front of means?
[04:15.53]I'm gaining on you.
[04:17.57]What the... That doesn't even... I... What is this device on my back?
[04:23.26]What is... Hey, Star.
[04:26.86]Hi.
[04:27.56]I teleported behind you.
[04:29.97]Great, I'm driving.
[04:36.25]No!
[04:37.31]See ya!
[04:38.15]No!
[04:38.73]Teleportation technique, unleashed!
[04:42.07]No, what the hell just, what happened?
[04:47.33]I'm about to win.
[04:48.31]I have a very serious question.
[04:49.85]Incredibly serious question.
[04:51.31]This needs to be addressed.
[04:54.03]Why is this game named Carnage Racing and not like Time Travel Racing?
[04:59.64]Why?
[05:00.48]What the fuck is the point?
[05:01.40]Why is this called Carnage Racing?
[05:02.98]It's not like Carnage.
[05:03.92]It's Time Travel.
[05:05.38]Getting it done, sugar.
[05:09.10]No, the game would correct itself.
[05:15.44]Mmm.
[05:17.68]What?
[05:20.44]You just... came... from... I... Wow, you've taken all my things.
[05:27.68]You're absolutely correct.
[05:28.46]That's cool.
[05:29.28]This whole game is just a series of, quote, what the fuck just happened?
[05:33.96]That's this whole game.
[05:35.04]Like, for instance, right?
[05:36.58]Like, what the fuck just happened?
[05:41.44]Yeah, come on.
[05:42.26]Hit me.
[05:44.00]I'm coming.
[05:45.26]I'm coming.
[05:46.13]I'm coming.
[05:46.53]Yeah, I'm coming.
[05:48.71]Okay, that was actually pretty awesome.
[06:01.09]Oh, I can't wait to- I'm just gonna be right behind Star.
[06:05.11]Oh, hey.
[06:05.69]Hi, Star.
[06:06.51]Hi.
[06:07.01]Hi.
[06:11.67]What just happened?
[06:13.59]I don't know, but I'm in first.
[06:14.67]Fuck you.
[06:16.66]You know what?
[06:17.00]I have an idea.
[06:18.22]You guys go ahead and play.
[06:19.78]Go ahead and play the game.
[06:22.00]You guys go play.
[06:23.88]And let me know when you're getting to the end of almost the entire race, okay?
[06:27.60]Okay.
[06:29.06]When you guys are looking at the finish line, I want you to tell me that, okay?
[06:34.62]Okay.
[06:35.10]I'm gonna go get a drink.
[06:35.78]I'll be right back.
[06:40.95]Oh, look, I'm having so much fun playing this video game with my friends.
[06:45.35]I haven't even moved one time.
[06:46.87]Oh, look, they're almost done.
[06:53.27]This is a fun racing game to play.
[06:55.08]Especially with your friends.
[06:57.70]You should go through... Oh, hi.
[07:02.68]Oh, hi, guys.
[07:03.48]Nice to see you.
[07:06.34]I'm gonna win the race.
[07:08.47]No, slow down.
[07:09.61]Slow down.
[07:10.33]I need to see if this works.
[07:13.53]What did you actually want?
[07:21.68]What is this game?
[07:24.24]That's so dumb.
[07:32.22]I'm done.
[07:32.84]Over.
[07:33.32]Game over.
[07:33.92]We're done.
[07:34.26]I don't want to play this anymore.
[07:37.24]There's no reason to play this.
[07:40.30]There's no reason to play this if you guys can just- if people can just do that.
[07:44.18]What's the point of ever playing this game?
[07:47.06]Ever.
