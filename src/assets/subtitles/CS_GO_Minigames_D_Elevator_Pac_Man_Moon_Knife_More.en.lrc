[00:59.88]Alright, can we just talk about this for one second?
[01:03.04]There is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people versus one dude on the other side.
[01:09.57]He's just bunny hopping.
[01:12.19]He's just bunny hopping.
[01:13.93]He's just bunny hopping.
[01:14.85]Look at all these people just firing and missing him.
[01:18.75]What have we not done?
[01:21.75]Team games.
[01:22.71]Are we voting?
[01:25.01]Yes, this is a voting system apparently.
[01:26.89]I voted for Ghost.
[01:30.29]I don't even know what I voted for.
[01:31.32]Jump rope.
[01:32.12]Okay.
[01:34.00]Jump rope.
[01:34.46]Let's do jump rope.

[01:35.98]Jump rope.
[01:42.71]Jump rope has been chosen.
[01:43.87]Okay.
[01:44.43]Uh-oh.
[01:45.29]What?
[01:45.97]Uh-oh.
[01:46.67]Oh, boy.
[01:47.27]Oh, boy.
[01:47.59]Okay, get ready.
[01:48.41]Can we... What do you mean?
[01:49.65]Oh, it's coming down.
[01:50.49]Oh, it's coming down.
[01:51.39]We're going to jump over it.
[01:52.87]It's going to go faster.
[01:53.93]I'm a master at this.
[01:54.77]Don't worry, guys.
[01:55.79]I'm so bad.
[01:56.42]If you start at one side and run towards it and then jump, it's easier.
[01:59.46]That's what I'm doing.
[02:00.24]Oh, it's going faster.
[02:00.94]It's going faster, though.
[02:01.46]It's going faster.
[02:02.48]It does damage to you.
[02:03.90]Everyone's... Oh, I got killed.
[02:05.64]Oh, I...
[02:06.60]I think we're out.
[02:10.50]I'm out.
[02:11.91]Come on, Jarmo.
[02:13.15]We're rooting for you.
[02:14.41]I'm looking for shredded cheese.
[02:15.57]Where is he?
[02:16.69]He's standing here, kind of at the end.
[02:18.09]To the right or to the left?
[02:19.89]I think I saw him get taken out.
[02:21.57]Look how fast it's going.
[02:23.39]Look at them all just jumping in a line in the middle.
[02:26.83]It's a black screen for me.
[02:28.27]Oh, there we go.
[02:29.61]Look at it.
[02:30.63]It's going like, how?
[02:31.59]How are they doing this?
[02:37.60]This is hilarious.
[02:39.24]Look how fast it's going.
[02:40.28]Seriously, they're going to have to be mashing it as fast as they can here in a second.
[02:43.18]I saw one guy get taken out.
[02:47.46]There's still four.
[02:48.04]There's four.
[02:48.36]This is impossible.
[02:49.54]Three, two.
[02:50.24]I think they're all gone.
[02:52.14]And then he gets to murder everyone.
[02:57.31]Again that was awesome.
[02:58.51]I want to do that one again so much fun I Really do want to do that one again.
[03:05.20]I want to vote for that one again.
[03:07.54]What was it which one won first?
[03:09.24]I think it's even game.
[03:11.99]I don't know I'm voting for team games.
[03:13.31]I can't remember which one was first Pac-Man Oh flash race Pac-Man Pac-Man
[03:21.73]We gotta go with Pac-Man.
[03:23.43]That's what I'm pickin'.
[03:25.73]I shot it.
[03:26.21]Flashbang race.
[03:27.37]Oh, flashbang race.
[03:28.01]Oh no.
[03:28.67]Flashbang race?
[03:29.61]Oh, now I really feel like a rat in a maze.
[03:33.42]Look, they're all over to the other side.
[03:34.64]I'm gonna- Oh!
[03:37.44]What?
[03:37.82]What's going on?
[03:38.30]Why do I have a flashbang?
[03:39.62]What is going on?
[03:40.86]You have to race to the end of the course, but you're being flashbanged the entire time.
[03:44.10]I just have a white screen!
[03:47.53]How do you get over this?
[03:50.09]Oh no, it's widescreen again.
[03:51.95]I do not understand.
[03:53.57]Has anyone figured out how to jump over this yet?
[03:55.13]No.

[03:58.22]I don't understand.
[03:59.64]Oh, he's in the game.
[04:01.32]Are we the only ones who haven't made it?
[04:03.42]Throw and fight.
[04:07.53]I think we're the only three that have not made it over the first ledge.
[04:12.33]How do you make that jump?
[04:17.90]Why does everyone know how to do that?
[04:19.24]Playing the white screen game.
[04:21.06]How does everyone know how to do that but not us?
[04:24.14]Yeah, do team games again.
[04:25.30]Team games.
[04:27.30]Oops.
[04:27.68]I'm voting for Pac-Man again.
