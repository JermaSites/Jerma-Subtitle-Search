[01:30.45]Oh god, hi.
[01:33.21]Hello everybody.
[01:35.47]How are you doing?
[01:43.26]How are things?
[01:46.28]Hope everybody's doing well.
[01:49.45]I'm sorry that we're this late, but it had to happen because of issues that I will go into.
[01:56.36]You know, I could go on a fucking rant and rave.
[01:59.64]I'm going to.
[02:00.36]Just hold on.
[02:02.28]It's fucking 910.
[02:06.73]Alright.
[02:09.85]Let me just get this ready.
[02:10.85]Like, I'm fucking so done with this shit.
[02:14.16]I don't even give a fuck if you guys see my, like, name on Xbox.
[02:17.50]Who cares?
[02:18.10]Fuck Xbox.
[02:22.89]So, anyways.
[02:24.55]Hi, everybody.
[02:25.56]My name's Jerma.
[02:26.18]Welcome to Friday Night Fuckface Night.
[02:28.64]Where I tell you a story about how I came to get to this game.
[02:32.88]We don't even... Fuck the intro.
[02:33.94]We're done with the intro.
[02:35.74]So, here's the deal.
[02:38.12]So... I was about to put the webcam on and show you my credit cards.
[02:43.07]I ain't doing that.
[02:44.27]Listen.
[02:45.57]Just give me a second.
[02:46.39]I am very flustered.
[02:47.91]I'm not fucking happy.
[02:49.05]We're going to go over this whole scenario.
[02:52.06]It's going to take a few minutes.
[02:55.53]This is a fucking default Xbox name, okay?
[03:00.67]I didn't even pick this name.
[03:03.39]This is like the you don't give a fuck about your username.
[03:06.69]Xbox is going to randomly generate one for you.
[03:09.60]That's what this is.
[03:12.86]So, anyways.
[03:14.52]Yeah, it's fucking Tended D Rangoon.
[03:16.48]Like, who gives a shit?
[03:19.08]So, listen.
[03:19.78]Listen to me.
[03:20.26]Listen to me.
[03:20.66]Here's what happened.
[03:22.79]So I wake up this morning.
[03:25.17]I say, you know, I could play Xbox if I wanted to, or I could play PSVR.
[03:32.43]We did a poll.
[03:33.75]The people decided that we were going to play Red Dead Redemption.
[03:36.73]That's what the people decided.
[03:39.10]I went to the online store to buy Red Dead Redemption on the Xbox One backwards compatibility fucking store.
[03:48.16]You can buy it on the store.
[03:50.20]Please buy.
[03:51.32]Okay, let's go ahead and buy this.
[03:52.76]That sounds like a fucking plan.
[03:54.49]I go to purchase it.
[03:55.31]It says, oh, sorry, you don't have a credit card on file.
[03:57.49]Which, by the way, let's first talk about that for one second.
[03:59.79]No credit card on file.
[04:01.41]Fuck off.
[04:02.39]Like, why can't I just buy the fucking game?
[04:04.67]Right?
[04:05.48]Why can't I just select Red Dead Redemption and purchase the game?
[04:10.18]I don't... Who cares about having a credit card on file?
[04:12.38]So, fuck that.
[04:13.08]Whatever, right?
[04:14.00]So...
[04:15.51]I change my credit card, put a credit card on file.
[04:18.95]I still don't have a credit card on file.
[04:21.13]I use my second credit card.
[04:22.67]I have two credit cards, credit card, debit card, you know, like most human beings.
[04:26.39]Both of them do not work, right?
[04:28.21]They don't work.
[04:29.63]So I'm like in fucking panic mode because like I don't have my fucking PSVR set up.
[04:35.70]And nothing's set up correctly.
[04:37.62]So I'm like, fuck, I have to go get Red Dead Redemption.
[04:40.84]So remember, keep in mind, I took out my two fucking credit cards out of my wallet and was like, I gotta put these into the fucking Microsoft Edge store.
[04:50.46]By the way, let's talk about that for one quick second here.
[04:54.02]Why do I have to go to like Microsoft.com to like change my credit card info?
[04:59.28]That's horse shit.
[05:00.94]Like, PS4, it's like in the fucking UI.
[05:04.28]You don't have to open up like a separate web page.
[05:07.16]Anyways, fuck that.
[05:08.40]So, both of my credit cards, by the way, out of my wallet now.
[05:13.08]I get in the fucking car and I drive to Walmart.
[05:17.34]It's like a 15 minute drive for me to get to Walmart.
[05:20.34]Credit cards out of my wallet.
[05:21.62]I don't have my credit cards in my fucking wallet.
[05:23.56]I go into the fucking store and
[05:28.19]And I go up to the fucking electronics section.
[05:31.07]Oh, you guys have Red Dead Redemption, right?
[05:33.33]Yeah, we do.
[05:33.87]We do have Red Dead Redemption, sir.
[05:35.61]Please come this way.
[05:36.63]They open up the fucking case, take it out.
[05:38.75]Yeah, that'll be fucking like $19, whatever this fucking seven-year-old game is worth.
[05:44.58]And I open it up.
[05:45.30]Well, there's no credit cards in there.
[05:47.26]I'm like, what happened to the credit cards?
[05:49.62]Oh, that's right.
[05:50.16]I took them out.
[05:51.20]I took them out.
[05:52.53]So I drove back and all the while I like called Kim to like fucking buy it on Amazon.
[05:57.79]So like get the game fucking purchased on Amazon.
[06:01.35]I'm screaming.
[06:02.71]I screamed in the car ride home.
[06:05.15]So you're talking about like 40 minutes just go by for no reason.
[06:08.58]I went to Walmart.
[06:09.34]No fucking credit cards.
[06:10.56]Screaming in the car.
[06:11.38]I screamed in the car.
[06:12.40]I swear to God.
[06:13.12]Fucking screaming in the car.
[06:15.40]I'm not kidding.
[06:16.10]This is real.
[06:16.66]Listen to my voice.
[06:17.88]This is not, like, making this up.
[06:19.40]I fucking screamed in the car.
[06:21.46]Nobody was there.
[06:22.27]I'm just sitting there screaming.
[06:23.79]Because, like, fuck, dude.
[06:24.75]That sucks so fucking bad.
[06:26.19]I would stream Red Dead Redemption.
[06:28.15]Like, what the fuck?
[06:29.53]How hard is this?
[06:30.95]Why does Microsoft have all... Forget about the whole fact that my credit cards work.
[06:35.78]I use them all the fucking time.
[06:37.38]They're not, like, disabled.
[06:38.40]They're not, like, turned off.
[06:39.32]It's a Microsoft bullshit issue.
[06:41.28]We get back.
[06:44.80]What?
[06:47.74]I'm fucking, are we live?
[06:51.60]What?
[06:54.17]Fucking blue screen to death.
[06:55.35]Like, I am, I am, like, gonna scream.
[06:59.05]I just turned my computer on and fucking instantly started streaming, by the way.
[07:02.83]I blue screened, if you're curious.
[07:04.68]Like, we'll wait for, everyone can refresh.
[07:06.30]We'll wait.
[07:10.12]What's the last thing, what's the last thing you guys saw, by the way?
[07:15.97]What's the last thing you guys saw?
[07:18.41]Because I saw something that I was not fucking happy about.
[07:26.71]A blue screen of death.
[07:36.34]Something about the car.
[07:40.19]Wait, hold on.
[07:41.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[07:58.08]Oh, my God.
[07:58.54]I'm so fucking angry right now.
[08:00.60]I was speaking for so long after that.
[08:02.96]I told you the whole story.
[08:04.14]Oh, God.

[08:39.66]Got in the car.
[08:42.56]No credit cards, right?
[08:43.44]Like, all my credit cards are gone.
[08:45.88]They were sitting here this whole time because I ripped them out.

[08:52.38]And... I was talking about Amazon.
[09:00.24]Okay, I got to Amazon.
[09:02.12]Got home after fucking not having my credit cards, driving like 40 minutes for no reason.

[09:14.34]Like, I was gonna ask the guy behind the counter.
[09:16.25]I just couldn't fucking do it, though.

[18:02.53]Okay, well, why would that even matter?
[18:04.72]What are you talking about?
[18:05.36]No, I don't.
[18:09.52]Why would I need to fucking... Possibly?
[18:14.57]I don't think so, dude.
[18:16.09]I don't think that's a thing.
[18:17.23]Oh, wow.
[18:19.41]What a shitshow.
[18:22.33]I'm so sorry.
[18:23.29]I just wanted to play Red Dead.
[18:25.31]That's all I wanted to do.
[18:26.35]And I wanted to have a fun stream.
[18:32.00]I downloaded the game.
[18:32.98]I bought a code off of Amazon.
[18:35.90]Use another account.
[18:36.68]I don't have any other accounts.
[18:37.84]This is my only one.
[18:40.81]What if I sign out of this account?
[18:42.41]Okay, I'm signed out of this account now.
[18:43.97]Let's, like, try to play Red Dead.
[18:45.73]See what happens.
[18:48.63]Okay, games.
[18:50.43]Red Dead Redemption.
[18:53.31]Okay, sign in.

[18:57.04]This is the account I bought it on.
[19:00.60]Your game will start soon.
[19:04.26]No, it's not gonna work.
[19:05.58]I'm getting the same fucking dog shit.
[19:14.66]You don't have the rights.
[19:21.35]I don't have the fucking rights to play this game that I bought, apparently.
[19:26.65]This is why Microsoft fucking sucks.
[19:31.59]Let me be real.
[19:33.07]What the fuck are they talking about?
[19:36.21]Why does everything have to be connected to my Microsoft account?
[19:40.19]What the fuck are you talking about?
[19:46.48]Hard reset your console.
[19:50.42]I already did that though, I thought.
[19:56.71]Start the Xbox offline.
[19:58.17]Look at this like troubleshooting stream.
[20:00.81]Oh my god.
[20:01.61]This is fucking ridiculous.
[20:03.44]I just want to play Red Dead.
[20:04.46]I bought the goddamn game and I fucking have it set to this account.
[20:07.38]I only have one Xbox account.
[20:11.41]The product is installed.
[20:12.31]Play.
[20:12.93]Are you sure you own this game?
[20:15.13]I don't know.
[20:16.33]You bought it online.
[20:18.99]I'll buy it right now.
[20:20.51]On the Xbox store.
[20:21.25]I don't even give a fuck.
[20:22.28]Where is it?
[20:23.56]How do I get an Xbox code?
[20:30.86]Hard... I'm gonna fucking... I'm ripping the cord out of the back of the... You want to see this shit on fucking camera?
[20:37.02]You want like a fucking camera?
[20:40.01]Take a look at this one.
[20:42.72]Oh, what's that?
[20:43.16]Is that the fucking power cord for the Xbox?
[20:45.96]Oh no, he wouldn't do that.
[20:47.52]Would he?
[20:48.74]Would he do that?
[20:49.44]Get the fuck out of here.
[20:59.10]Fucking shitty ass console.
[21:00.84]What the fuck?

[24:49.18]I actually might have broken the Xbox.
[24:51.62]I don't even care.
[24:52.98]Fuck this console.
[24:59.92]Oh, well, Dead Rising 4 opens.

[25:33.39]There's nothing here.
[25:37.46]I'm gonna try to restart the console one more time and then we'll plug in the PlayStation 4 in and I'm buying PS Now.
[25:43.56]You guys, I'm not kidding.
[25:45.06]This is- we're going all night.
[25:46.18]I don't care.
[25:46.74]I don't care.
[25:47.68]I told you guys this is gonna happen.
[25:49.16]It's gonna fucking happen.
[25:50.28]I'm playing Red Dead Redemption on this fucking stream.
[25:54.00]I promise.
[25:54.96]It's gonna happen.

[25:56.96]Let's get it a signal.
[26:02.26]I still have to install it.
[26:03.38]No, no, no.
[26:03.82]PS Now, dude.
[26:04.66]PS Now is like where it's at.
[26:07.90]Hold power for 10 seconds to properly reset.
[26:09.98]You got it.
[26:10.44]Holding it down.
[26:14.76]I'm holding this power button down.
[26:21.76]Okay, here we go.
[26:24.62]Full on reset.
[26:28.65]Drive to GameStop and buy it.
[26:29.91]Wish I had these credit cards.
[26:31.93]Almost showed them on camera again if it was on.
[26:35.54]We're going this way.
[26:36.68]You guys are going over here.
[26:37.68]No, we're not.
[26:38.24]I'm going to break something.
[26:39.44]Hold on.
[26:41.94]Move this fucking stupid giant box console out of the fucking way.
[26:49.22]Dumbass console.
[26:52.32]IRL drive to GameStop stream?
[26:53.90]I can't do that.
[26:54.90]I fucking... My credit cards are right there.
[27:06.80]Put away your debit cards before you show them on stream.
[27:08.86]Like, is it weird that I'm just so flustered right now that I don't give a fuck?
[27:14.01]God, fucking buy something.
[27:16.63]Buy a fucking Lamborghini for all I care.
[27:18.69]Like, I'm fucking irritated.
[27:19.95]Okay, open.
[27:31.16]I don't even know who these people are.
[27:33.06]Did I get like a thousand friend requests?
[27:36.14]I'm sure I did.
[27:43.62]Fucking work.
[27:50.49]We're gonna put in a fucking real console.
