[01:05.05]Wow, do I got a story for you guys.
[01:08.95]Oh, boy.
[01:09.66]I mean, we're talking about this.
[01:12.30]I got a tale for you guys tonight.
[01:15.08]So, let me paint you a picture here, okay?
[01:18.64]I wake up.
[01:19.94]I wake up in the morning.
[01:21.00]It's like 10 o'clock in the morning, right?
[01:23.53]Okay, I woke up.
[01:25.29]They were mowing the lawns outside.
[01:27.09]It woke me up, so I'm like, shit, they're mowing the lawns.
[01:29.83]I got to get up, okay?
[01:30.61]So, get out there.
[01:32.51]Walk like 10 feet outside to get my coffee.
[01:35.20]BANG!
[01:35.88]Newspaper hits me right in the face.
[01:37.74]Fucking kid on his bike threw newspaper at me, hit me right in the mouth.
[01:41.24]And like, I was bleeding a little bit.
[01:42.91]And I guess I get the paper delivered, and yes, I know he throws it.
[01:45.49]Doesn't matter.
[01:45.93]I opened the door and got hit in the mouth with the newspaper.
[01:48.15]Bloody mouth.
[01:49.07]And I'm trying to scream at the kid.
[01:50.99]Like, tell him to be more careful.
[01:52.13]He's already gone.
[01:52.69]He's on his bike.
[01:53.27]They go fucking like 40 miles per hour on those damn things.
[01:55.91]So, get in the mouth, get fucking hit in the teeth.
[01:58.62]Two teeth came out.
[02:00.12]Bottom tooth, bottom, uh, teeth number C and teeth I came out.
[02:04.28]If you're a dentist, you know which teeth I'm talking about.
[02:07.47]So, get in the car with a bloody ass mouth.
[02:09.59]I didn't even care to put, like, tissue paper in there.
[02:11.77]Back up, back up, hit the fucking pole, the telephone pole behind me, because I was in a rage at that kid, you know?
[02:17.56]Hit the telephone pole, telephone pole comes down on the car.
[02:20.17]Boom!
[02:21.79]Holy shit!
[02:22.55]It like hits down to the passenger side.
[02:24.03]Nobody's in the car.
[02:24.59]Everything's fine.
[02:25.25]It's just damage.
[02:26.69]I gotta call the fucking AAA now.
[02:28.17]Call up AAA.
[02:28.87]Say, hey, AAA, come on down.
[02:30.47]I just ran a pole over.
[02:33.33]Boom!
[02:35.03]The car exploded, by the way, when I was in it.
[02:36.77]It was like, boom!
[02:38.51]Just an explosion.
[02:40.02]Like fire and shit was in the air.
[02:42.16]AAA comes down.
[02:43.26]I got a smoldering car now.
[02:44.56]And I gotta wipe off the dust.
[02:46.72]There was a little bit of dust on my face I had to wipe off.
[02:50.34]Triple A comes down.
[02:51.74]Guy shakes my hand after taking my rubble away.
[02:53.86]Says that'll be $4,000.
[02:54.56]What are you talking about?
[02:58.73]$4,000?
[02:59.53]That's not... You pay Triple A and they come and they fucking take the car and they deal with it.
[03:33.24]So, uh, anyway.
[03:37.17]Uh, no, I woke up late, didn't feel well.
[03:39.97]I had, like, stalling.
[03:43.39]Whatever.
[03:44.64]You call it stalling, I call it temporary solution to a permanent issue.
[03:54.10]Uh, I woke up, I didn't really feel well.
[03:56.68]But the show must go on, right?
[03:58.62]I drank a bunch of coffee.
[04:00.86]Something really weird, this is a real story.
[04:03.57]So I'm gonna tell you a real story now.
[04:05.63]I woke up today with like the spins.
[04:10.49]I had like vertigo, it was fucking weird.
[04:12.15]I had like a bad headache, I've been dealing with this weird headache shit and stomach problems for the last like four or five days.
[04:18.88]But it was fucking weird.
[04:20.94]I woke up and like got up and I was like, oh, time to get up.
[04:23.02]And like the world started spinning around.
[04:24.32]I don't know.
[04:25.64]I wonder what's wrong with me.
[04:26.50]I have no idea.
[04:26.88]I'm going to find out.
[04:27.78]I got a doctor's appointment in 10 minutes.
[04:32.19]How are we doing on this install, by the way?
[04:40.43]I did download it earlier.
[04:42.81]I did download this earlier.
[04:44.17]Took about two and a half hours to download.
[04:51.12]And the paper boy hit me in the face.
[04:53.22]Yeah.
[04:53.93]He did.
[04:55.61]Alright, we're gonna get started.
[04:56.65]It's just like doing the little install.
[04:58.73]It's already, like, done.
[04:59.65]Don't worry.
[05:04.09]Do a live stream from the doctor's office.
[05:10.41]But to be... Let me be real.
[05:12.99]I've just been a little fucked up recently.
[05:17.61]But I'm alright right now.
[05:19.54]And we're gonna play Demon's Souls tonight.
[05:22.88]I say Demon's Souls.
[05:23.76]It's not Demon's Souls.
[05:25.34]It's Demon's Souls.
[05:29.66]It's hard for me to say that.
[05:31.11]I'm just gonna say Demon's Souls.
[05:33.47]Because the two S's aren't doing it for me.
[05:37.69]That would be like if it was like Dark's Souls.
[05:40.49]Demon's Souls.
[05:41.67]Dark's Souls.
[05:44.69]It's all good.
[05:46.22]We're gonna start this.
[05:47.06]I have no idea what's gonna happen.
[05:50.33]I have played all the other Dark Souls FromSoftware games, but not this one.
[05:54.63]And I heard this one is fucking like the hardest one in the entire series.
[06:03.97]How are we doing?
[06:04.62]71%?
[06:04.66]Yeah, we're good.
[06:08.44]Show us your Dark Soul.
[06:10.04]Uh, right off the bat, Stix Renegade, like, right off the bat, just gave 10 bucks.
[06:14.04]Hey, Jerma, the classic Rat song was voted best joke on rgermanna5.
[06:18.54]You should celebrate by watching Rat Movie.
[06:20.60]No, we're not watching Rat Movie right now.
[06:23.32]Uh, we might, I might turn on, nah, but like, this... Dark Souls 3 sub only was important.
[06:31.27]Because I obviously was like a huge fan of like that game...
[06:36.18]Maybe we will, just to not get completely spoiled and ruined.
[06:41.00]Yeah, I think, I think tonight's gonna be sub only.
[06:44.80]Just because, like, who, like, this is like... Yeah, otherwise people are gonna be fucking screaming at me.
[06:50.14]I can already see it.
[06:51.06]I can already smell it in the chat, you know what I mean?
[06:53.87]I can smell in the chat, like, everyone saying, like, You fucking idiot!
[06:57.35]You're supposed to hit the left leg!
[07:00.07]Kill him!
[07:03.33]Don't worry, Demon's Souls makes very little sense.
[07:08.67]Oh, but the rap movie song was the best joke I've ever made, apparently.
[07:14.88]I don't know.
[07:15.88]I love all my jokes.
[07:16.82]I love all my children.
[07:18.60]Equally.
[07:19.72]Except for... Except for the Shmi joke.
[07:24.41]That's my least favorite child.
[07:26.33]That's the child that gets a D on every test.
[07:29.03]I still love him.
[07:30.33]But, you know, you come home with a D- on your report card, I'm going to be kind of upset with you.
[07:37.23]Alright, we're pretty much there.
[07:39.85]Let's just watch this until it gets there.
[07:45.33]Now that it's sub only, let's watch Rat Movie.
[07:48.90]Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
[07:50.40]Look, if it turns out, I might get like 20 minutes into this and not give a shit and we'll turn sub only off.
[07:56.34]But just like initially, initially we're going to have it on.
[08:03.24]So I apologize.
[08:04.12]This is not something I do very often.
[08:05.76]I don't, like, put sub only on to play video games.
[08:09.37]Only in cases where, like, I can get literally screamed at all stream.
[08:13.25]Maybe.
[08:16.39]Thank God for Amazon Prime.
[08:20.84]But thank you Chromatic Aberration for three bucks.
[08:24.04]Hey, Jerma, moving to Austria tomorrow and wanted to say thank you for all the good times.
[08:27.86]I'll have, I will have to be a VOD boy now.
[08:30.47]Well, thanks for three bucks.
[08:32.13]Thanks for sticking around.
[08:32.81]Hopefully you enjoy the VOD.
[08:34.17]Hopefully it's worth watching.
[08:37.11]Sir Feline, thanks for the $5.
[08:38.17]Are they replica?
[08:40.07]Nowhere's Ark 2.
[08:40.85]Well, that was from four days ago.
[08:42.70]That's how stupid I am.
[08:49.60]But yeah, I don't know what to expect.
[08:53.04]I asked this, like, maybe, like, four days ago.
[08:56.76]I asked this, like... Let's just do this so people know, like, the stream's starting soon, right?
[09:02.99]Let's, like, lower the volume so we can talk.
[09:06.99]Cheer508, what am I wearing?
[09:09.73]Basketball shorts, a t-shirt, and a shaved face.
[09:16.45]But we'll see how this goes.
[09:18.01]I've wanted to play this for a long time, but I've never had the courage to put my PlayStation 3 over here.
[09:24.42]10 months and all I get is an installation bar.
[09:26.26]That's not true.
[09:26.74]This is the very... We're going to be going late tonight.
[09:28.92]This is going to be a late night stream.
[09:32.32]We'll be at least until like 12 or 1 a.m.
[09:36.20]Eastern Time.
[09:38.30]Just took me a while to get started today.
[09:39.64]I wasn't... I'm still not feeling great.
[09:41.52]I'm going to a doctor.
[09:42.62]I'm going to find out what the fuck is wrong with me.
[09:46.52]Where was the shaving stream?
[09:48.28]I did one of those.
[09:50.56]I didn't, but... You know.
[09:53.24]Alright, we're almost there.
[09:54.96]Like another two minutes.
[09:57.53]Thank you, RoboGandalf, for the five bucks.
[09:59.01]Thank you, Reaper, for the five bucks.
[10:01.23]What you wearing?
[10:02.49]Fixed.
[10:03.19]What?
[10:04.91]The shpee is your best joke.
[10:07.89]I think it was good.
[10:08.59]I don't know if it's my best.
[10:09.83]It's still one of my children.
[10:10.73]I love them.
[10:11.88]Like I said.
[10:13.94]Thank you, Everland, for the ten bucks.
[10:15.76]Hey, Jerm, I've been a fan for a long time.
[10:17.00]I just wanted to say thank you for all the laughs and helping get through the recent death of my dog.
[10:21.82]You're awesome, Willem.
[10:23.32]Sorry to hear that.
[10:25.28]Sorry to hear about your beloved animal.
[10:28.36]It's always tough.
[10:29.46]It's always not cool.
[10:31.26]Hope you feel better, man.
[10:34.14]Lamb Lamb, thank you for the $15.
[10:36.20]Hope you get better.
[10:36.88]Me too.
[10:37.17]Alright, now we can come back.
[10:39.57]We're at $95.
[10:40.21]I would consider my stream... You know what I mean?
[10:44.41]If I'm going to be a little egotistical here, I think my stream is a 95%.
[10:47.19]What do you guys think?
[10:52.37]Like if you, okay, if you were to grade beef and don't make any, don't make any fucking jokes.
[10:57.33]Don't be like, Oh, just 10.
[10:59.25]Like grade.
[11:00.03]I want like a letter grade for my stream.
[11:01.75]I want like a, like, what would you, if I, if this stream from the last like year was a test, what would you grade it?
[11:08.79]I don't want to see any like, Oh, maybe like 30%.
[11:10.53]Like, no, I want to know.
[11:11.85]I want a real grade.
[11:17.32]D plus D minus D C minus.
[11:22.20]And by the way, I want all the mods to catch all these and give me an aggregate and tell me what my stream is worth.
[11:30.13]Hey, 98 percentile.
[11:31.21]About to play Demon's Souls.
[11:40.71]Yeah.
[11:41.01]100%.
[11:41.03]Here we go.
[11:43.83]Install complete.
[11:45.33]Let's just do this.
[11:56.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, I'm waiting I'm please waiting There it is five titles what how are there five titles in here There it is.
[12:16.21]Alright, here we go Dark Souls zero
[12:25.48]Oh no.
[12:26.84]Don't lose connection.
[12:32.06]What are you doing?
[12:34.80]There it is.
[12:35.70]There's the logo.
[12:39.10]I gotta be careful here with audio.
[12:40.66]I gotta make sure this isn't too loud.
[12:47.23]Bring back the jazz?
[12:48.37]What do you mean the jazz?
[12:52.29]This ain't gonna do like an install to install the game, right?
[12:57.86]Is it going to be 30?
[12:58.66]The game is compatible with the system data autosave feature.
[13:01.27]Why do they always say that?
[13:02.37]Of course it is.
[13:04.41]I've got to be careful with the audio here.
[13:05.95]I really do.
[13:09.55]What have we got for a soundtrack here?
[13:11.07]I don't hear anything.
[13:15.01]Got to make sure my trophies are all set.
[13:16.35]This used to be a Garfield stream.
[13:21.63]No, it never was.
[13:23.47]We blurred out Garfield's dick once, and all of a sudden this is a Garfield stream.
[13:30.83]Okay, Atlas.
[13:32.53]Remember when Atlas was publishing like half these games?
[13:36.99]What happened to Atlas?
[13:37.71]Do they still do like Persona?
[13:40.13]Did they ever do Persona 5 or Persona 4 or Persona 3?
[13:44.19]What else did Atlas do?
[13:50.28]You got to stop saying we did the joke.
[13:53.12]We did the same.
[13:54.30]Well, whatever.
[13:55.02]We're a collective unit.
[13:58.24]On the first day.
[14:03.57]Man was granted a soul, and with it clarity.
[14:08.15]Some might call it a dark soul.
[14:10.73]On the second day, upon Earth was planted an irrevocable poison, a soul-devouring demon.
[14:22.60]On the third day of Christmas, my mother gave to me five golden rings.
[14:32.57]Do they all start like this?
[14:34.65]Every Dark Souls game starts like this.
[14:42.40]What?
[14:42.62]Come on, that was good.
[14:45.32]How do you play these games?
[14:46.44]What kind of game is this?
[14:48.28]I have no idea.
[14:50.41]It's like an action RPG?
[14:51.93]Sounds fun!
[14:52.49]I can't wait to check it out!
[14:53.27]Cool!
[14:55.31]Are they quick time events?
[15:08.75]Can't wait to fight that guy.
[15:12.98]This is kind of like Dark Souls.
[15:26.44]Oh, nice.
[15:27.32]Celebrimbror just saved us.
[15:34.63]I'm actually kind of excited.
[15:38.90]It's very Bloodborne-esque.
[15:39.94]Well, Bloodborne is one of my favorite games ever made, so maybe I'll like it.
[15:49.22]That guy's pretty big.
[15:55.62]Jittery teeth.
[15:56.88]You know, those little teeth that you wind up and sit down and they go like... That guy's teeth.
[16:02.37]No more jokes.
[16:05.44]Okay, look, every one of these games is weird.
[16:09.68]Right?
[16:10.14]Like, it's hard to, like, even know what the hell I'm doing.
[16:13.52]How loud is this?
[16:14.18]Probably too loud.
[16:17.71]No, that's familiar sounds.
[16:24.17]What in the name of God?
[16:25.37]Okay.
[16:32.72]Okay.
[16:35.95]Thanks for, like, writing this whole thing in, like, wingdings.
[16:43.22]Yeah.
[16:47.42]Just the brightness until the shield is visible and dragon is invisible.
[16:50.42]Well... There's no dragon, so we're just gonna do this.
[16:57.78]Uh... I guess this is fine.
[17:00.47]I don't have analog control right now.
[17:02.79]Should I be concerned about this?
[17:05.56]my analog isn't moving up and down hopefully that's not going to be a problem yeah subtitles it's fine right yeah drop the music a little it's fine uh so anybody that's played this game like is the analog used here at this point yet
[17:30.11]I'm, like, actually terrified that, like, my analog's not gonna work and this is gonna be, like, all for nothing.
[17:33.59]Alright, let's make a name.
[17:35.47]Uh, let's name him... Uh... What in the fuck?
[17:43.77]Oh, it's like a fucking phone.
[17:47.59]A B-B-No, not B-J-G.
[17:51.73]Oh, God.
[17:52.97]Hold on.
[17:53.37]Alright, go back.
[17:59.33]You don't think it's used?
[18:00.03]Okay.
[18:01.23]It's normal?
[18:01.69]Okay.
[18:02.67]Uh, how about, uh... No, fuck.
[18:15.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:19.52]This is fucking with my head.
[18:27.79]How about just Tim Machine?
[18:29.67]Tim Machine!
[18:32.21]Tim Machine.
[18:32.99]Tim Machine.
[18:38.85]Who cares?
[18:39.23]It doesn't even matter.
[18:41.71]Tim Machine.
[18:43.84]There it is.
[18:47.06]Mail.
[18:47.60]Class.
[18:48.16]Alright, now this is where shit don't even matter, right?
[18:51.34]What am I going to do?
[18:52.24]Vitality, Intelligence, Endurance.
[18:53.98]It's all the fucking same.
[18:54.88]We're going to go Strength.
[18:57.56]Barbarian?
[18:58.06]I think I'm gonna do like a strength build just for the- I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
[19:05.76]Maybe Temple Knight.
[19:06.99]Who's got the highest vitality?
[19:08.09]Soldier.
[19:08.49]Maybe I'll do Soldier.
[19:11.93]Yeah.
[19:14.09]Dex is better than strength in this game?
[19:20.72]Royalty.
[19:24.70]It should be Royalty?
[19:25.80]Why?
[19:29.72]No, every time I play one of these games on stream, it's a dex build.
[19:32.74]I'm not doing another dex build.
[19:35.52]I want to do something different.
[19:37.62]Magic is godly in this game.
[19:39.20]Magic is better than anything in this whole game.
[19:44.91]Is it one of those situations where I'm going to be able to throw a lightning bolt and kill a boss in one hit?
[19:51.05]Or should we give ourselves a slight... I don't know if I want to do that.
[19:59.76]Changes his face?
[20:00.74]Why?
[20:01.00]He looks like fucking Vegeta.
[20:02.20]Don't you guys like Dragon Ball Z?
[20:04.97]We're gonna go strength.
[20:06.99]We'll do, like, knight.
[20:08.21]No.
[20:13.29]I think I'm just gonna do barbarian and just be a fucking sicko.
[20:16.56]You know what I mean?
[20:21.46]Strength.
[20:21.82]Well, let's just do it.
[20:25.70]Magic school bus.
[20:28.79]Look, this is our very first time playing the game.
[20:30.87]I can always do it again.
[20:32.01]It's better than his appearance.
[20:37.13]Let's make him... Just make him from the west.
[20:42.19]All my characters have to be old.
[20:45.45]He's going to be like... Alright, more male or more female?
[20:48.37]Okay, that's fine.
[20:50.06]Hairstyle... Let's go like here.
[21:01.04]He didn't even look that old.
[21:03.10]None of this shit even matters.
[21:04.50]I know, I'm gonna keep the Vegeta hair.
[21:07.96]We'll do, like, female Vegeta.
[21:13.94]Alright, that's fine.
[21:16.76]Oh, wait, I got more of this shit.
[21:21.16]Okay, never mind.
[21:22.00]I didn't know there was this much in Demon's Souls.
[21:25.26]Oh my god!
[21:33.73]Let's go, like, in here.
[21:34.91]I'm just turning him into the scream mask.
[21:43.32]Okay.
[21:47.24]Let's go, like... Oh my god!
[21:54.36]It really is just, like, glue, man.
[22:00.46]Shape.
[22:02.50]It's fine, yeah.
[22:06.26]Okay.
[22:08.50]Sounds good to me.
[22:10.52]What about his forehead?
[22:21.60]He looks very angry.
[22:26.03]Eyebrows.
[22:27.47]No eyebrows.
[22:28.17]That's fine.
[22:33.31]Brow ridge.
[22:36.45]I want to have real big eyes.
[22:39.87]Okay.
[22:41.47]Let's go down to the jawline first.
[22:45.61]I want to pull his leg.
[22:46.50]I got to give him a big chin.
[22:50.82]Not like this.
[22:56.44]Big wide chin.
[23:00.36]Big jaw.
[23:04.38]He really is just a scream mask.
[23:08.64]Okay.
[23:10.36]Facial hair?
[23:11.56]No, no facial hair.
[23:14.02]Here comes Dr. Mosquito.
[23:21.54]I want to keep him, like, happy.
[23:24.16]Why is happy?
[23:25.30]Happy takes his mouth and makes it small.
[23:26.96]Let's go with, like, down here.
[23:38.26]Alright, I'm happy with this.
[23:43.70]He kind of looks like Beavis and Butthead mixed with Vegeta mixed with Willem Dafoe.
[23:53.27]I like it.
[23:56.03]Cheeks.
[24:01.75]That's fine.
[24:04.03]He looks like a Simpsons character, too.
[24:08.71]Okay.
[24:09.01]Alright, I'm good.
[24:10.93]I'm good with this.
[24:13.75]That's it, right?
[24:16.28]There he is.
[24:18.96]Tim Machine 9, Barbarian.
[24:21.88]I'm going for it.
[24:24.44]We'll meet again, Spider-Man.
[24:33.49]Peter.
[24:35.13]Don't tell Harry.
[24:37.27]Ah.
[24:40.15]I might do pretty good death sounds.
[24:41.53]Hire me.
[24:44.05]Dark Souls.
[24:48.33]I want to see a fucking chant in the chat right now.
[24:50.96]Dark Souls.
[24:51.92]Dark Souls.
[24:52.86]Dark Souls.
[24:53.76]Dark Souls.
[24:54.68]Get it, streamer.
[24:55.66]Go get it, streamer.
[25:00.36]No.
[25:00.50]No.
[25:07.50]I'm going to kick everybody's ass.
[25:08.84]No hit stream.
[25:09.72]Not going to get fucking one point of damage.
[25:11.74]...unleashing terrible demons.
[25:37.63]Fucking demons.
[25:38.21]Chaos is a ladder.
[25:38.67]I'm sorry.
[25:58.18]each time a demon claims a human soul the demon's own soul is invigorated I was trying to compensate for the loudness power of a mature demon's soul is beyond human imagination spread quickly mighty warriors were drawn to the accursed land
[26:22.02]But none have returned.
[26:24.18]So what is the penalty for dying in this game?
[26:25.52]I know it's weird in every game.
[26:26.95]Dark Souls 2 added the permanent maximum HP thing that you had to do until you did Humanity.
[26:37.37]The game uninstalls itself.
[26:51.64]Alright, so I'm gonna have to pay attention because this is a pay attention game so don't expect me to like be like super Like interactive or making a bunch of fucking jokes.
[27:11.32]No, I gotta know where I'm going pay attention This is a fucking real video game stream
[27:16.20]A lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog.
[27:20.52]Hey, thank you, Bing, for the 15 bucks.
[27:21.70]Has the land found its savior?
[27:24.76]Or have the demons found its slave?
[27:26.08]Hey, Jerma, have some money for making me laugh daily since 2012.
[27:30.42]Thanks a lot, Morty.
[27:31.82]Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[27:34.78]That's me.
[27:37.00]Thank you, Dan with wings for the 5 bucks.
[27:38.36]Thank you, Spaghetti.
[27:39.86]Spaghetti Tony for the 5 bucks.
[27:42.58]Make him glue man.
[27:44.44]He already kind of is.
[27:47.67]This is like fucking... Okay.
[27:57.90]I thought I was like blue.
[28:06.68]I'm already excited.
[28:13.53]Fucking Homer Simpson.
[28:14.93]Homer Simpson glue man.
[28:18.81]Here we go.
[28:21.55]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dark Souls.
[28:24.16]You're gonna fucking die.
[28:25.90]Are all the buttons like the same?
[28:30.06]Pretty much.
[28:35.07]Alright, right off the bat, it actually feels, it actually feels like this moves a lot quicker than Dark Souls.
[28:40.82]Right off the fucking baloney, you know what I mean?
[28:42.40]Alright, let's see here.
[28:44.08]Uh, R1, of course it is a standard attack.
[28:45.96]I'm sure it controls the same way.
[28:48.46]I'd be surprised if it didn't.
[28:54.99]Holy shit, wow, game is so easy!
[28:56.79]Is it running the same?
[28:59.13]Jumping the same?
[29:02.23]I'm trying to get familiar.
[29:05.88]Yeah, that sprint.
[29:06.88]Uh-huh.
[29:12.20]L1 is guard.
[29:13.10]Yep.
[29:14.12]Is there a... Yes, there is.
[29:18.40]There is a parry in this game.
[29:20.98]Of course there is.
[29:21.60]Why wouldn't there be?
[29:23.44]Oh, that didn't kill him.
[29:24.18]Is there a dive?
[29:25.82]Oh, that... Okay, I like that.
[29:27.02]You can do like a baseball swing.
[29:28.16]Alright, there's no charge attack.
[29:30.75]Like there is in Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne.
[29:32.57]That's fine.
[29:34.03]Big money, holy shit.
[29:35.25]Big money.
[29:35.67]Hold on a minute.
[29:37.41]Oh my god.
[29:38.15]Big money.
[29:39.11]Big money.
[29:39.99]Big fucking money.
[29:40.83]Alright, calm down.
[29:43.35]Never trust a purple who just gave $100.
[29:46.75]Fucking idiot.
[29:47.39]You were supposed to hit the right leg.
[29:52.98]Well, thank you, purple.
[29:55.04]Thank you, moderator purple, for the $100 bill.
[30:01.37]Tell me to hit the right leg.
[30:02.57]It's alright.
[30:03.31]And look, that's... I tell you, no damage run.
[30:07.69]But thank you so much, dude.
[30:08.61]You've been contributing to this channel for, like, fucking years now.
[30:13.37]So... Like, am I... You know what?
[30:15.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[30:17.01]Hold on a second.
[30:18.37]Shit!
[30:20.33]Oh, fuck!
[30:21.69]It was my, like, one year anniversary, like, two days ago, right?
[30:24.95]Did I miss it?
[30:26.45]Let's just pretend it's right now.
[30:29.66]It's been one year on Twitch like with a little with a schedule I've been streaming on Twitch for like a couple of like maybe like three years or so four years But like my one year actually like with a schedule streaming like three or four days a week is is now So hey happy one-year anniversary Hey, didn't get you anything, but I got you love and that's what matters.
[30:51.84]Thanks guys much love Didn't think it was gonna didn't I you know I didn't ever thought I'd gonna fucking see the day where I'd stream for one year and
[30:59.82]Thank you.
[31:03.09]Oh, I'm glad this is in this game.
[31:04.61]Perfect.
[31:05.61]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[31:06.05]You know what?
[31:06.97]This is a fucking FromSoftware game.
[31:13.15]I can already tell I'm gonna like this game.
[31:14.77]Just the way it moves.
[31:15.81]I don't like... Look, guys.
[31:16.82]I'm gonna be fucking real.
[31:19.60]I don't like the way... I don't like the movement in Dark Souls.
[31:24.50]I don't.
[31:25.66]This feels much less stiff than Dark Souls does.
[31:28.60]I don't know why.
[31:29.16]Something about it.
[31:29.78]It feels like it's a fixed, stiff animation.
[31:33.10]Sorry if I'm offending you.
[31:34.52]I really am sorry.
[31:35.64]Let's make it like Yooka-Laylee.
[31:43.73]No.
[31:44.69]Don't do that.
[31:47.83]Just checking the frames there.
[31:49.12]Just checking.
[31:53.80]I got damaged?
[31:54.48]No, I didn't.
[31:55.30]That was not... But that was like... I wasn't paying attention.
[31:59.14]Turn it off.
[31:59.78]Alright.
[32:00.14]Well, thanks for watching, everybody.
[32:01.40]I got hit once in the tutorial.
[32:02.87]Sorry.
[32:04.91]But... Yeah, thank you, everybody, so much.
[32:08.01]Thank you, Reaper, for letting more $5...
[32:13.36]Thank you, Steady Shoe, for the 15 bucks.
[32:15.02]Pin for the 10 bucks.
[32:16.04]You guys are giving me a fucking lot of money right now.
[32:19.48]You guys spoil the fuck out of me.
[32:22.32]Don't think that for a second that every day that I don't, like, appreciate this shit.
[32:25.47]Like, I don't even know what to say.
[32:27.45]I've gotten, like, fucking $200 since starting this stream.
[32:30.43]Like, it's fucking ridiculous.
[32:32.07]You guys are too good to me.
[32:34.29]I better make a fucking joke quick.
[32:37.95]Let's just go.
[32:42.27]Why are we doing next?
[32:43.25]Next?
[32:43.51]What do you mean next?
[32:44.13]Thought I was going to get hit by that.
[32:47.35]Nope.
[32:47.61]I've played your video games before.
[32:52.36]You don't think I've ever played a Souls game before?
[32:54.40]Think I'm going to get hit by that shit?
[32:57.44]Crescent Moongrass.
[33:03.72]Okay.
[33:03.90]Is there an Asylum Demon?
[33:05.84]Squares use item.
[33:06.82]Yeah.
[33:08.00]Soul Remains.
[33:09.38]It's just like the other ones.
[33:14.66]More crescent moon grass.
[33:15.58]I'm assuming this is the consumable health thing, right?
[33:18.18]I guess I gotta drop down here.
[33:27.22]You're gonna get some Chex Mix?
[33:28.28]We gotta wait for Tim.
[33:30.12]Tim's going to get Chex Mix.
[33:31.86]I refuse to continue playing until he's back with his Chex Mix.
[33:34.54]Sorry.
[33:37.28]Nah, I'm just fucking kidding.
[33:39.52]Is it gonna hurt?
[33:41.54]Alright, well that... Okay, in the... In Dark Souls games, that probably would have done like half my health pool.
[33:47.82]Backstep and... Yeah, backstep.
[33:51.70]Wait, hold on a minute.
[33:54.36]There's just a straight up backstep in this game.
[33:57.26]I'm just testing to see like how far it goes.
[34:03.67]Just testing.
[34:07.05]Is there a backstab in Demon's Souls?
[34:08.79]That's what I want to know.
[34:13.33]I ain't eating no Chex Mix.
[34:15.46]Did I miss anything back there?
[34:17.98]Nope.
[34:19.16]Nope.
[34:20.72]I love how very clearly in the top says, tutorial.
[34:24.04]It's like, yeah, I know.
[34:25.10]And look, of course there's a swamp in the game.
[34:26.64]Mm-hmm.
[34:33.61]Yes, there is.
[34:36.05]Oh, look at that.
[34:38.69]Happy streaming birthday?
[34:39.93]Thank you.
[34:40.51]Whoa!
[34:41.29]That's up top.
[34:41.93]Supposed to be paying attention.
[34:43.19]Don't die in the tutorial.
[34:44.47]People will make fun of you.
[34:48.61]Wow, that heals nothing.
[34:50.48]Look at this.
[34:51.86]This stuff sucks.
[34:53.84]So that is the heal.
[34:54.80]So it is like Bloodborne in the sense it has a consumable heal.
[34:58.28]Oh boy, oh boy.
[34:59.10]Okay.
[35:01.71]This whole game is a swamp?
[35:04.01]Archstone.
[35:07.53]What?
[35:08.94]Touch the arch stone.
[35:12.22]I will.
[35:12.50]I want to make sure I don't miss any items.
[35:16.02]So is that the bonfire of Demon's Souls?
[35:18.30]The arch stone.
[35:22.92]Let's check back here.
[35:23.88]Remember, I'm going to take it slow.
[35:26.26]I'm going to enjoy it.
[35:27.10]Because this is my first blind experience with this game.
[35:30.32]I love all the other ones.
[35:31.64]So I'm going to take my time.
[35:32.80]I'm not just going to rush it.
[35:34.24]You know what I mean?
[35:34.68]I guess we're going to go.
[35:43.79]The Archstone of Mampang.
[35:46.67]There is no jump in the game and there is no drop attack.
[35:49.05]That's actually really good to know.
[35:50.23]Thank you.
[35:53.43]I was trying to jump and I was trying to figure that out.
[35:55.37]Okay, R2 is a strong attack.
[35:57.05]Yeah.
[35:58.45]It sure is.
[35:59.15]I do... I like it.
[36:07.64]I like it.
[36:09.15]I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, because I didn't know, because it's really old, and it's their first game in this entire series.
[36:14.51]But I like it.
[36:14.99]Bonfire.
[36:17.97]I'm just kidding.
[36:21.36]L2 is parry.
[36:23.18]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[36:25.44]I wonder what the frames are like in this game.
[36:28.04]Let's try it.
[36:28.52]Okay.
[36:33.32]It's pretty similar, I guess.
[36:34.22]It's a little faster.
[36:38.04]It is a little faster.
[36:40.28]But that's cool.
[36:43.50]This is blocked off.
[36:46.02]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[36:49.16]Watch out for that tree.
[36:50.06]Okay, here's one question I do want to ask.
[36:51.83]I don't want to waste my time.
[36:53.59]Are there illusory walls in Demon's Souls?
[36:56.25]I don't want to fucking walk around whacking walls if it's not the case.
[36:58.63]Whoa, we got a fucking boss!
[37:00.35]First boss of the entire series.
[37:01.65]This is the first ever Dark Souls boss.
[37:06.31]Okay, well that didn't work.
[37:16.82]Nice try.
[37:22.62]52.
[37:23.50]Only on... There are so many walls.
[37:25.57]Are there?
[37:28.83]Don't tell me that.
[37:29.45]Because I'm going to be so paranoid.
[37:30.49]I'm going to be hitting every wall.
[37:32.29]Wield weapon with both hands.
[37:33.91]Yes, I know how to do that.
[37:36.25]Let me get a parry here.
[37:37.11]I've got to get the right timing down with this.
[37:42.55]There it is.
[37:46.32]Are we in sub mode?
[37:46.94]Yes, we are.
[37:48.10]At least temporarily, just so I can get a feel for the game, you know?
[37:52.37]No, not actually.
[37:53.83]Boss down.
[37:54.91]Yeah, as the first boss.
[38:01.71]The one thing I will say about this game that I do not like, just straight up, and I had the same exact problem with Bloodborne.
[38:12.44]We are at pretty much a locked 30 FPS, boys and girls.
[38:16.94]Change weapon, change item.
[38:19.29]I'm assuming this is a half heal or a better heal.
[38:24.43]I can get used to that fairly quickly.
[38:25.86]I got used to it in Bloodborne, so it's just a question of getting used to it here.
[38:31.34]You rented this at Blockbuster and you took it back the same day.
[38:35.28]Hey!
[38:39.06]I can't imagine buying this game or renting this game from Blockbuster and not knowing what I was getting myself into.
[38:46.22]I would hate it.
[38:49.54]Here's a quick little story about my experience with the FromSoftware games.
[38:57.33]I made videos on Dark Souls.
[38:59.75]I made a Dark Souls 1 game video.
[39:03.69]I had no idea what the fuck was going on.
[39:06.15]I thought the game was terrible.
[39:08.05]I was just like, why do people like this?
[39:10.51]This game is so dumb.
[39:12.13]I just didn't get it.
[39:13.05]I literally just did not fucking understand.
[39:16.45]To me, none of the mechanics made any sense.
[39:19.83]I was playing it like an action game.
[39:21.43]I was playing it like Devil May Cry.
[39:25.51]Is it worth breaking boxes?
[39:27.31]Or is that just like every FromSoftware game?
[39:28.75]Doesn't matter.
[39:35.27]Blockbusters is extinct.
[39:36.37]Alright, well this is a boss.
[39:39.23]We got a first boss here?
[39:40.19]Tutorial boss?
[39:43.21]I can't jump over this, can I?
[39:45.25]Um... I got... Was there like a checkpoint I needed to do?
[39:48.90]Or is this just like Dark Souls 1 where there's just random fog gates?
[39:51.32]Yeah, okay.
[39:51.78]It's just a fog gate.
[39:53.70]Let's go over here.
[39:58.22]There's a guy following me.
[40:00.50]I know it.
[40:01.58]I know this shit.
[40:04.18]Don't fall off the edge.
[40:06.06]Because you're doing like a fun move.
[40:08.20]Okay, let's go.
[40:08.78]What did I just get?
[40:09.22]Crescent Moon?
[40:11.28]Oh, dude, that was the second first boss.
[40:12.90]Second first boss down.
[40:16.02]Demon's Souls was the tutorial for Dark Souls.
[40:20.18]I asked people.
[40:22.02]Didn't a bunch of you guys tell me that Demon's Souls is the hardest game in the entire series?
[40:27.37]Am I insane or did somebody say that?
[40:30.53]I thought a lot of people said that this game is the game that's the hard one.
[40:34.07]It's like the most annoying and frustrating.
[40:35.57]Is that the truth?
[40:36.85]We're gonna find out right now while I first try the second boss.
[40:40.13]We'll find out when I first second try the first boss.
[40:42.27]Here we go.
[40:43.75]The Vanguard.
[40:44.25]I don't know what that move is.
[41:03.12]Just two swings?
[41:06.12]Dude, this fucking music is awesome!
[41:10.04]I feel like I'm at like a- Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
[41:12.56]I'm too busy paying attention to the music!
[41:17.12]Holy shit!
[41:17.70]Eat it!
[41:17.94]Oh, I'm dead.
[41:38.50]Wait, was I supposed to die?
[41:39.58]I think I was supposed to die.
[41:51.85]Maybe not.
[41:52.29]I don't know.
[41:56.21]That was my only chance at that boss?
[41:58.09]What?
[41:59.98]What are you talking about, my only chance?
[42:04.77]Why did they get rid of like the funny, yeah I was supposed to die, look that doesn't count as a death.
[42:09.10]This is cool.
[42:09.92]You can beat him though, I'm sure you can.
[42:33.13]Bring me back to life.
[42:41.76]There I am.
[42:42.86]You could have killed him if you were good.
[42:44.83]Oh, come on.
[42:47.15]That's not fair.
[42:52.89]Do you guys remember Assassin's Creed Syndicate?
[42:59.03]When everybody was making fun of that game because of how fucked up the character models could get in cutscenes?
[43:05.18]That was just an Assassin's Creed Syndicate meme post from, like, our gaming.
[43:13.48]You have died and the Nexus has trapped your soul.
[43:15.40]You cannot escape the Nexus.
[43:19.73]I can't escape the nexus.
[43:24.47]However, by capturing demons' souls, you can reclaim your physical body.
[43:31.40]Nexus binding.
[43:36.04]What the fuck is that?
[43:37.70]Is that not a ring?
[43:42.16]That looked like a ring, didn't it?
[43:45.42]Not a ring.
[43:46.24]There it is.
[43:47.30]User loses souls and is returned to the Nexus.
[43:48.98]Sorry, this is just like the... Okay, no, why would I ever use that?
[43:53.92]That's one of those Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne items where you just go, I'm never using this.
[44:01.10]Cool, okay, let's talk.
[44:03.13]Well, you slipped through the fissure too, did you?
[44:06.57]Just the dark side, yeah.
[44:07.73]You came for Demon's Souls?
[44:10.67]Or to save this land and be remembered as a hero?
[44:16.23]He even thinks it's funny.
[44:23.33]I like this already.
[44:25.83]This is just like Bloodborne, isn't it?
[44:29.36]Where you get the gravestones and you can travel from the hub.
[44:32.86]Is this a hub area?
[44:36.72]This is definitely a hub area.
[44:37.98]I'm going to like this game a lot.
[44:42.68]Oh, yeah.
[44:43.76]This is just the gravestones from Bloodborne.
[44:46.88]I already fucking... This already is game of the year.
[44:49.54]Like, it already is.
[44:50.96]This is already my second favorite Souls game.
[44:54.67]Hmm.
[44:56.31]You new here?
[44:57.03]Do you have my services?
[45:00.69]The name's Baldwin.
[45:02.80]Just an ordinary blacksmith.
[45:05.70]It's simple.
[45:07.40]Just bring me all the souls you can.
[45:11.36]In trade, I'll give you weapons or forge ones you already have.
[45:17.17]With your souls, I can eke out a living.
[45:20.79]And with my weapons...
[45:23.11]Um, alright, hold on a sec.
[45:27.53]So this is... So this guy... This is, like, before he got, like, fat, right?
[45:34.15]This is the blacksmith from Dark Souls 3 and, like, all the Dark Souls games.
[45:36.66]This is the same guy, but he just got, like, fat, right?
[45:38.82]He looked like he had the same hair, same goatee, same glasses.
[45:43.68]Yeah, he just, like, he gets on, like, a fucking weight gain regimen and gets in, like, Dark Souls 3.
[45:47.36]Alright, so let me see...
[45:53.24]You know, darling, the first thing you gotta remember about these Souls games is never buy a fucking weapon.
[45:56.89]Ever.
[45:58.47]Just, I'm gonna use the turkey leg for a while and we'll be fine.
[46:01.31]What about repairing shit?
[46:02.54]I don't know.
[46:02.92]How much Souls does that take?
[46:04.78]I don't, I don't, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've...
[46:11.78]Who's this?
[46:12.74]I'm Stockpile Thomas.
[46:14.78]Items?
[46:15.56]When the Scourge came, I didn't know what hit me.
[46:19.21]When I came to, I found myself here.
[46:21.99]This is just like Bloodborne, isn't it?
[46:24.75]My wife and daughter fell victim to the demons.
[46:29.36]But I would be worthless in battle.
[46:32.14]At the very least, I would be happy to lighten your load and look after any...
[46:38.32]Deposit item.
[46:39.72]Take item.
[46:40.78]He's like the stash.
[46:42.00]Oh, this is so good.
[46:44.68]This is so good.
[46:46.28]The true demon soul starts here.
[46:51.34]Welcome!
[46:52.94]I gotta put one down.
[46:56.21]I don't think I know how to do that.
[46:58.73]What is this?
[46:59.13]Touch blood stain.
[46:59.85]Somebody jumped off the fucking cliff.
[47:01.53]Nope.
[47:01.85]Somebody fought this guy and died.
[47:08.33]Welcome to Dark Souls, buddy.
[47:11.11]Now, what about up here?
[47:11.89]Let's look around.
[47:14.67]Ooh.
[47:17.81]Hi.
[47:18.81]How do I put something down?
[47:20.98]Why do I even care?
[47:21.62]This game is like a decade old.
[47:23.06]No one's gonna find it.
[47:25.90]These are just... Look, no one's gonna find these.
[47:27.72]These are just the top comments on YouTube.
[47:30.80]They're gonna be here.
[47:35.40]I can't put down any fucking sign.
[47:36.64]No one's gonna read them.
[47:38.84]What's up here?
[47:42.66]Oh, somebody fell off.
[47:44.14]Fucking dumbass.
[47:44.96]It's gonna say, be wary of cliff.
[47:49.14]Take a step forward.
[47:49.98]Ooh, nice top comment.
[47:51.98]212 upvotes.
[47:52.60]This place is huge.
[47:59.67]We'll find it?
[48:00.43]I kind of just want to explore this area.
[48:03.63]This is like a cool little spot.
[48:05.53]I'm in trouble.
[48:06.03]Please recommend this message.
[48:07.31]Wait, what?
[48:11.01]That's what you do?
[48:12.73]That's what you do?
[48:14.43]You're, like, tied up in a basement somewhere and you just- you lo- you get into, like, Demon's Souls and say that's where, like, somebody help me?
[48:21.45]Oh, shit, I gotta, like, call the police!
[48:22.84]No, I gotta, like, text a friend!
[48:24.02]No, no, no, I'm gonna make a Dark Souls message.
[48:26.48]Somebody help me!
[48:35.28]You know, I guess in, like, a roundabout way, if you had, like, somebody- if you got, like, captured or something-
[48:40.25]And the guy that captured you was like, yeah, you're not getting on your phone.
[48:45.04]You'd be like, dude, what about PlayStation 3, man?
[48:47.38]Can I play Demon's Souls?
[48:49.88]Alright.
[48:50.96]Don't try anything funny.
[48:52.40]What the fuck is that guy going to know?
[48:55.35]That guy doesn't know that you can put notes in the game.
[48:57.21]Fuck, maybe I should help that person.
[49:00.11]Oh, there's more people.
[49:01.11]A lot of people are kidnapped, apparently.
[49:09.24]Nine years later.
[49:10.38]Oh, God.
[49:12.90]Oh, God.
[49:16.14]Nine years later.
[49:21.85]That guy could have been already freed.
[49:23.69]You know what I mean?
[49:24.23]It's still there.
[49:24.81]I wonder what happened to you.
[49:29.45]You really play with fire there.
[49:31.11]Oh, I see what he was trying to do.
[49:34.87]Is there something there?
[49:37.90]Should I do that?
[49:38.40]Is there something on this ledge?
[49:40.32]He had to be doing that for a reason.
[49:41.50]Look, that's a top death comment.
[49:42.96]Like, why would it be there?
[49:48.99]This is really, really cool, though.
[49:50.41]I really like this area.
[49:52.89]The architecture is... beautiful.
[49:55.61]It's perfect.
[49:57.51]There is a secret there?
[50:01.04]Look, we're not fucking with secrets right now.
[50:03.10]There is a secret.
[50:03.56]What do you mean, there's a secret?
[50:06.32]I think this qualifies as backseating.
[50:10.24]You understand?
[50:10.70]I think this might qualify as backseating.
[50:15.65]And we all know I have an extreme rule.
[50:20.31]What is it?
[50:20.65]Is it that?
[50:23.11]I have to get on that.
[50:24.11]I have a very strict rule about backseating.
[50:28.19]Alright, so I'm going to try this.
[50:29.29]Okay.
[50:34.73]Here we go.
[50:39.14]Yeah, I'll, you know... You know, I'll take a, uh... I'll take a secret first try, first roll.
[50:47.19]You know, like, it's okay, guys.
[50:48.73]I'll take a first fucking try roll.
[50:51.05]Don't worry about me.
[50:55.69]Alright, where do I gotta go from here?
[50:56.69]Down?
[51:03.45]Where is it?
[51:05.19]Yeah, there it is.
[51:06.27]Yeah, don't worry.
[51:06.77]No big deal.
[51:08.99]Let me get this right.
[51:24.44]Shit.
[51:26.63]It's alright.
[51:26.99]It's alright.
[51:27.35]It's alright.
[51:27.65]It's alright.
[51:27.95]I'll get it.
[51:31.53]Oh!
[51:31.69]Oh!
[51:33.15]And, you know, I will take a fucking free secret.
[51:36.15]And, you know, everybody wants to talk about how I can't do anything.
[51:39.65]I'll take a secret.
[51:40.77]That's fine.
[51:42.99]Mm-hmm.
[51:48.77]Anything else?
[51:52.16]Should we just sightsee up here?
[51:58.92]Yeah, you know.
[52:00.40]That's good.
[52:01.36]I'll take the new moon grass.
[52:03.65]What about that?
[52:04.11]What's right there?
[52:09.05]It's alright.
[52:10.01]That was it.
[52:10.35]I got it already.
[52:14.99]Alright, let's go.
[52:20.57]Now where?
[52:22.33]I like this.
[52:22.79]Is this the statue?
[52:24.69]I'll go back to the... Wait, what was that?
[52:25.93]Bloodstain.
[52:29.22]Oh, shit.
[52:29.70]You found a pepperoni secret?
[52:32.99]I guess we'll just touch the stain, right?
[52:34.57]Touch the arch stone.
[52:35.65]Okay.
[52:37.81]So this is just warp to the area.
[52:39.48]This is just fucking blood run.
[52:42.16]I like it.
[52:43.44]I like it.
[52:50.87]So is that a full heal?
[52:57.77]World 1-1.
[52:58.27]Here we go.
[53:22.93]I had too much caffeine.
[53:24.05]I can't do it.
[53:26.45]Too much caffeine.
[53:27.53]I can't like do it.
[53:28.29]I like stumble up a little bit.
[53:29.39]Watch out for the fucking gargoyle that drags you to the first city.
[53:45.38]Super Mario Souls.
[53:48.38]Uh-huh.
[53:54.20]Is somebody riding on that?
[53:55.74]I don't know.
[53:59.11]Boletari... Boletarian Palace.
[54:02.31]Okay, we're at the Boletarian.
[54:05.59]Touch the Archstone.
[54:06.83]No, this is just... Are there even bonfires?
[54:10.72]And how do I get my fucking body back?
[54:13.46]Use parries on the next enemy.
[54:17.39]Thanks for the tip.
[54:19.24]Why would I do that when I can do this?
[54:22.42]I'm glad that you stay, like, invincible.
[54:24.34]Excuse me.
[54:28.94]So, how do I get... Do I have to kill a boss to get my body back?
[54:31.62]Are you serious?
[54:35.32]I have 50% health?
[54:39.92]I have half HP until I kill a boss?
[54:44.05]What?
[54:45.92]Beware of distraction ahead.
[54:49.58]What would that be?
[54:53.54]Free thing.
[54:54.94]Late moon grass.
[54:55.86]There's too many moon grasses.
[54:56.72]What does that even mean?
[54:57.54]Late moon grass.
[55:01.03]Perfect moon grass for me.
[55:11.17]Fuck, man.
[55:11.65]That sucks.
[55:13.45]I have to kill a boss with 50% health?
[55:16.28]That's so punishing.
[55:19.50]Watch out for you.
[55:21.94]Watch out for fucking Bagboy over here.
[55:28.39]These birds attack?
[55:29.11]No.
[55:31.93]That's fine.
[55:32.47]Okay.
[55:32.93]I'm in trouble.
[55:33.41]Please...
[55:35.38]Look, you know like 95,000 people made that joke before you did?
[55:39.19]And why is that always the top comment?
[55:40.65]This is just like YouTube.
[55:43.01]Somebody writes the same joke and it gets upvoted to the top every time.
[55:48.01]Like, what a parallel.
[55:48.83]This was 10 years ago.
[55:49.59]This is before YouTube was even like that popular.
[55:52.42]They were already doing the YouTube top comment joke.
[55:55.46]Like 15 years ago.
[55:59.06]Watch out for the sneak attack.
[56:00.36]Sure.
[56:04.51]Oh, that hurt.
[56:05.01]A lot.
[56:08.10]That takes a long time, too.
[56:11.46]Come on, bring it down.
[56:14.00]Right in the back.
[56:14.88]Hey-ya!
[56:17.03]30 years ago.
[56:17.49]Yeah, this game, dude.
[56:18.71]You're talking about, like, my... Like, why are you making, like, a Mario 64 reference?
[56:22.17]You guys realize this game came out, like... Like, six months after Mario 64.
[56:26.09]Like, we're aware of that, right?
[56:29.56]I just want to make sure you guys understand that.
[56:33.98]Yeah, watch out for the sneak attacks.
[56:35.24]Only seven upvotes.
[56:36.18]That was not a very popular comment.
[56:45.45]You're dead.
[56:50.85]Let's clear it out.
[56:54.75]Dude, you know, I like this place.
[56:55.67]This kind of reminds me of Undead Burg.
[57:00.47]I really like Demon's Souls, the starting area, because it really reminds me of Undead Burg.
[57:11.65]Up and around, probably.
[57:12.83]There is a secret in there.
[57:15.09]Don't know how to get it.
[57:17.13]Watch out for the propane tanks.
[57:20.15]Somebody died here, for some reason.
[57:21.47]Why?
[57:22.23]Because that guy's going to... Hold on, just break some stuff.
[57:28.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[57:29.15]Let me check the front door.
[57:33.80]This game came out before Mario?
[57:35.26]Wait, this game came out before Mario 64.
[57:39.58]I might have my timeline wrong.
[57:40.90]I mean, whatever.
[57:42.22]I know it's like six months either before or after Mario 64.
[57:45.20]It might even be like the same week.
[57:51.47]I think it came out on the same Tuesday.
[57:54.01]There's a lot of people coming.
[57:56.93]Come on.
[57:59.41]Is there a dashing, like a lunging attack?
[58:02.04]Why don't I stand still and find out?
[58:04.50]No, it's not.
[58:06.18]There's not a, like, lunging R2 attack in this game, it seems.
[58:10.88]Shit.
[58:11.94]Sloppy play, come on.
[58:14.80]Maybe the same company?
[58:16.26]Yeah, FromSoftware made Mario 64, too.
[58:18.18]They were, like, an uncredited... FromSoftware ghost-writ Mario 64.
[58:22.41]I don't know how many people know that or not.
[58:27.83]They developed a whole game, and then just, like, put Nintendo's name... Something Lotus?
[58:36.28]Rum software?
[58:36.94]What are you talking about, rum software?
[58:41.24]What the fuck is this?
[58:43.14]What is that?
[58:45.25]Take a step forward.
[58:46.49]What is this?
[58:48.25]Am I just going to die by going in here?
[58:50.99]What is this sparkly particle effect thing?
[58:54.13]I'm too scared to do that.
[58:55.05]No, I'm not doing that right now.
[58:57.64]I'd rather go in the dark hallway.
[59:00.48]Have some guy you see yeah, I knew it and I was gonna say I have some guy from the right swing at me I've played too many of your video games.
[59:06.46]You can't this is the first time they flip they pulled those tricks, too And I've already seen him This is like okay, you know um You know like Penn and Teller and like Penn and Teller now
[59:18.70]Like, when Penn & Teller got really popular, they had these elaborate fuckin' tricks with, like, they, like, cut off Penn's head, and, like, put it on some guy's body, and, like, switch a route, and put his hand up his ass.
[59:28.45]They, like, did a bunch of crazy shit.
[59:30.21]Like, I've seen the Penn & Teller monologues before.
[59:33.55]When I go back and watch the old Penn & Teller, when they first started, and they were, like, pulling rabbits out of a hat, I've seen it.
[59:38.97]I've, I don't, you can't fool me, Penn.
[59:41.15]Or Teller.
[59:43.31]Very, very, very good entertainers, by the way.
[59:45.01]If you've never seen, like, a Penn & Teller special...
[59:47.78]Go do it.
[59:48.98]It's fucking remarkable shit.
[59:51.20]Those guys are very talented musicians.
[59:54.08]Magicians.
[59:54.82]You know what I mean?
[59:55.58]That's what I was saying.
[60:01.25]Rolling can't break things.
[60:05.27]Firebomb.
[60:07.77]Hold on a second.
[60:08.33]I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.
[60:09.17]Let me go back in here.
[60:11.87]I do like how there's no lantern I have to turn on.
[60:17.49]Beware of the bloodstain ahead.
[60:20.31]Why?
[60:22.71]So, what was the consensus?
[60:23.93]No illusory walls?
[60:25.59]Was that something you guys were just kidding about?
[60:27.63]I didn't even look at chat because I'm an idiot.
[60:31.96]Beware of the bloodstain.
[60:32.84]Why?
[60:41.42]I don't understand.
[60:41.90]The guy walked out.
[60:45.06]I, like, ran out of the room.
[60:46.58]Okay.
[60:46.94]Well, that's fine.
[60:48.84]Just because you're a wuss.
[60:52.39]I need armor or something, man.
[60:53.63]I'm, like, just... I'm just, like, naked.
[60:58.77]What?
[60:59.79]I didn't get that?
[61:03.02]I was certain I got that.
[61:04.84]Just two-handed turkey, man.
[61:06.16]No, none of this bullshit.
[61:14.04]Ah.
[61:15.62]There we go.
[61:17.36]You know what I'm saying?
[61:18.02]Like, I... You two-handed turkey it.
[61:19.54]There's no reason to not do two-handed turkey.
[61:24.85]I honestly can't remember if there are leisure walls.
[61:28.27]Yeah, well, I've never played, so... Alright, what is this shit?
[61:30.57]What's going on here?
[61:31.61]Be wary of the enemy's barrage.
[61:33.97]Sure.
[61:36.29]Enemy barrage.
[61:38.75]Beware of the enemy barrage.
[61:40.47]Guy up top.
[61:44.94]Okay, well, let's just bait this guy down and then... Oh, okay.
[61:48.50]That's what they mean.
[61:50.18]That's what you mean by that.
[61:51.20]Okay, fine.
[61:51.74]Do it again.
[61:56.61]An item down there.
[61:59.37]I already like the level design, that's for sure.
[62:02.23]At least so far.
[62:03.37]That could change very quickly.
[62:04.53]Am I dead?
[62:06.81]Yeah, this guy just killed.
[62:10.06]That's some free souls.
[62:13.21]Yep.
[62:13.81]Dark.
[62:14.76]This is where I gotta be careful here.
[62:16.04]Don't fuck around.
[62:18.22]Something could be just, like, right here.
[62:19.38]Something's gonna happen.
[62:21.34]Mail Breaker.
[62:22.02]Okay, that's the first weapon.
[62:28.96]It will, don't worry.
[62:32.38]The... Remember to be careful of your weight limit.
[62:34.18]You can't just carry everything.
[62:36.37]Okay.
[62:37.55]So there is a very strict weight limit in this game.
[62:39.49]Alright.
[62:39.93]So that means I have to get rid of shit.
[62:42.19]We got a blood stain here.
[62:44.65]We got a blood stain here.
[62:45.65]Uh-oh.
[62:47.62]Must be something bad up there.
[62:51.00]Patience is a virtue.
[62:55.70]You thought I was a barrel.
[62:57.72]You were wrong.
[62:59.72]Friend, on the other hand, is a real piece of work.
[63:10.66]Am I safe right here?
[63:11.26]I don't think I'm safe right here.
[63:12.86]I gotta wait till I'm safe.
[63:13.56]Because I want to change this up.
[63:15.08]This is no time to read messages.
[63:18.66]You are right.
[63:21.12]Wait till... Where are you throwing this from?
[63:23.62]What the fuck?
[63:24.14]Where is he?
[63:24.66]Oh, he's up there.
[63:27.24]Until he throws it again.
[63:32.03]No, this is gonna be... Alright, here comes a little bit of a challenge here.
[63:34.17]I don't want to fuck around.
[63:40.54]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[63:42.96]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[63:49.48]Eventually, hey!
[63:49.82]What the hell was that?
[63:53.02]Oh, you.
[63:53.70]I can't see you, so you're blending in with the environment.
[63:57.82]Quit blending in with the environment.
[64:02.23]I gotta drop down into there.
[64:04.73]I know what I need to do.
[64:05.73]Ah, shit.
[64:07.65]Do I?
[64:13.54]Shit, I do have to like drop down in there, huh?
[64:20.43]Shit.
[64:21.73]Oh well, maybe I can get back up there later.
[64:29.22]This is where you don't want to mess around.
[64:31.12]Because I will fall off this cliff and everyone will fucking LUL.
[64:38.02]TotalBiscuit is going to laugh in my face if I accidentally roll off this cliff, so it can't happen.
[64:43.66]Almost happened.
[64:44.30]That almost just happened right when I said it wasn't going to happen.
[64:48.02]No one's coming behind me, right?
[64:51.57]Observation.
[64:56.45]What am I observing here?
[64:59.03]I guess this is where I just...
[65:08.93]Oh, total biscuit.
[65:09.91]You almost laughed at me.
[65:11.21]Almost.
[65:11.67]Not this time.
[65:13.91]Not this time.
[65:20.79]We're good.
[65:21.29]We can go down there.
[65:23.35]Let me see if I can drop down here.
[65:25.34]Where is it?
[65:25.70]Right there, right?
[65:31.24]Half moon grass.
[65:32.20]Okay, can I fall down there?
[65:37.99]Mmm.
[65:39.45]This is going to be a sneaky roll, right?
[65:41.25]Looks like a sneaky roll.
[65:45.96]Oh, great.
[65:47.72]There's no jumping, so I guess I kind of have to just roll in that.
[65:51.90]Maybe not.
[65:53.88]Stop eating grass.
[65:55.00]I can't help it.
[65:55.56]It's fucking delicious.
[65:56.56]Can I just drop down?
[66:01.20]No, I definitely have to roll into this.
[66:04.59]This is not a sneaky roll at all.
[66:06.51]This is actually a difficult roll.
[66:09.64]No, wait.
[66:10.46]Why did you hop backwards?
[66:13.74]Okay, let's try it again.
[66:16.46]Nope, that didn't work.
[66:21.81]Okay, well that didn't work either.
[66:27.59]I don't think that's how you do this.
[66:29.86]So we're going to just keep going.
[66:38.89]Nothing over here, right?
[66:40.05]This is not like anything I can drop down into?
[66:42.69]No.
[66:43.51]Just checking.
[66:45.45]Just checking.
[66:47.13]I want to exhaust my options.
[66:48.37]This is a blind run.
[66:49.87]I'm blindfolded.
[66:51.03]You didn't know.
[66:51.53]I'm sensing the game with my mind.
[66:59.55]Of course.
[67:00.27]That's what you had to do.
[67:02.02]They pulled that joke.
[67:03.08]Penn and Teller already did that in fucking Dark Souls.
[67:06.78]And I didn't even see it coming.
[67:07.78]In the same first area, too.
[67:12.84]Well, bastard sword.
[67:14.00]I think I'm gonna have to put this on.
[67:17.04]What's my equipment at right now?
[67:18.44]Let's see.
[67:21.63]Uh... Bastard sword.
[67:23.29]95.
[67:23.59]Eh, it's just better.
[67:28.43]Does it say... Does it... Do these things scale?
[67:33.12]What's the scaling?
[67:37.15]I mean, like, I'm gonna assume that there's, is there like a scaling?
[67:43.77]Stats needed?
[67:44.51]Like, you got like the weather channel wind patterns here for your scaling.
[67:52.95]It's like, you're talking about like a cold front coming in from the left.
[67:56.70]And like snow that's gonna be entering our atmosphere.
[67:59.02]This is not like strength, skill, magic, like, what is this?
[68:10.41]I'm assuming it's D for strength.
[68:13.54]This is a C. So this is D scaling initially.
[68:16.76]I need 18.
[68:18.22]I need 18 fucking cold front.
[68:22.88]I don't have that yet, so we're gonna hold on to this.
[68:26.86]I'm not gonna equip it.
[68:30.07]Am I losing?
[68:31.33]No, I can two-hand it.
[68:35.53]You're not strong enough to use it with one hand.
[68:36.85]You may use it efficiently if you will.
[68:38.73]Okay, that's fine.
[68:41.88]We'll just two-hand it.
[68:43.44]Dude does more damage, might as well.
[68:44.80]How slow is it?
[68:45.48]It's not that slow at all, actually.
[68:49.10]Oh, yes, it is.
[68:49.77]This thing is fucking slow as shit.
[68:51.39]Whatever.
[68:53.79]Meteorology stats.
[68:55.07]It really is.
[68:59.63]Okay, look.
[69:00.19]In the later games, they got more and more clever.
[69:02.24]They got clever about it.
[69:03.86]Guy flexing was strength.
[69:06.06]High five was dexterity.
[69:08.84]Ding-dong was faith.
[69:11.18]And... Book was intelligence.
[69:15.65]I mean, that's so much more... That's easier to understand.
[69:25.03]I'm just, like, whacking the wall.
[69:26.49]Alright, gotta be careful.
[69:28.46]So let's get to full health.
[69:29.18]I'm gonna move behind.
[69:32.02]Of course there is... Alright, I see a fat guy back there.
[69:34.30]Okay, I'm concerned a little bit about that fat guy.
[69:38.41]I'm actually concerned about it.
[69:39.41]Let's go this way first.
[69:40.63]I'm concerned about that fat guy.
[69:41.75]I just walked into that.
[69:46.36]Could you be any stupider?
[69:48.90]I don't know.
[69:51.22]There's a shortcut somewhere around here?
[69:52.48]Uh-oh.
[69:54.34]I got invaded.
[69:56.63]I can tell I got invaded because that guy has a hat on.
[70:00.17]I think I might be doing less damage per swing with this, by the way.
[70:04.79]If I'm not crazy.
[70:06.37]Which I might be.
[70:08.27]Am I?
[70:12.65]I don't know about this.
[70:13.39]I don't know if I like this.
[70:23.46]Am I doing less damage with this fucking thing?
[70:29.14]Huh?
[70:29.90]Don't bother with miracles.
[70:36.47]Yeah, that's an invader down.
[70:37.67]Okay, give me a second.
[70:41.75]Oh, Lord.
[70:42.53]Beware of the formidable foe ahead.
[70:44.17]Ay-yi-yi.
[70:45.13]Hold on a minute.
[70:46.99]Is this the Panther?
[70:48.61]Or the Patriot?
[70:49.21]What was that guy's name?
[70:51.50]The Protector?
[70:52.24]The fucking guy with the sword and the shield that flew down and floated into your atmosphere?
[70:57.02]What was his name?
[70:58.84]The Punisher?
[71:01.12]The Patriot.
[71:01.98]What was his name?
[71:02.96]From Dark Souls 2.
[71:06.55]The Pursuer!
[71:07.29]The Pursuer!
[71:07.81]There it is.
[71:08.21]Yeah, yeah.
[71:08.91]The Patriot!
[71:09.53]We gotta watch out for the fucking Patriot!
[71:12.51]Not yet.
[71:12.99]I'm gonna look at the other side first.
[71:16.53]Just in case I... There might be like a shortcut.
[71:20.48]I gotta be careful.
[71:25.74]Dude, wherever the formative... Okay, this... No.
[71:27.28]Okay.
[71:27.58]Well, I can't... I can't do this with... I gotta two-hand this guy.
[71:32.24]Come on down.
[71:33.78]Come on down, Bob Barker.
[71:35.65]What?
[71:36.19]These guys have weird animations.
[71:53.88]That's a weird animation.
[71:55.92]Just is.
[71:56.26]I don't care who you are.
[72:00.28]He's got three swings.
[72:08.26]300 souls for that okay hmm there's a fog gate I don't know if I want to do that let me just see what else is over here in case I get myself into some trouble I wanted to parry that guy but I don't think that was possible
[72:34.20]This reminds me of the first area in Dark Souls 3.
[72:37.38]There's like that two different ways you can go and it splits up.
[72:42.74]I could see how they could... I could see how they made this game.
[72:46.62]You know?
[72:48.62]Here they come.
[72:49.26]Here they come to kill the beast.
[72:53.30]Hey!
[72:56.95]What did you guys do?
[72:57.91]What happened?
[72:59.55]What was that explosion?
[73:02.40]Wait, is there like a trap right here?
[73:05.84]What blew these guys up?
[73:09.09]What was that?
[73:09.47]I'm confused, but whatever, that's fine.
[73:18.93]Oh, there were like bombs here.
[73:23.00]Is this like a shortcut?
[73:23.96]I hope it is.
[73:24.74]Hi.
[73:25.58]Can you give me some more information other than the word hi?
[73:28.28]I would really appreciate it.
[73:33.10]Shortcut?
[73:36.56]Attack.
[73:39.06]This is definitely a shortcut.
[73:41.12]Has to be, right?
[73:43.82]Okay, shortcut.
[73:48.08]Huh?
[73:49.58]What the hell did that do?
[73:53.00]What did that do?
[73:57.43]That didn't do anything!
[74:01.83]What did that do?
[74:05.15]This is a shortcut.
[74:08.71]Oh, there's items down here.
[74:09.59]Okay.
[74:11.14]Fuck, that's not a shortcut.
[74:12.12]I thought a ladder was going to drop down.
[74:13.48]Oh, well.
[74:18.16]Oh, this is a shortcut.
[74:18.90]There's going to be a door to open down here.
[74:21.07]And I can run up the stairs.
[74:21.75]Perfect.
[74:21.93]Perfect.
[74:24.43]Shortcut one.
[74:25.61]Shortcut.
[74:26.79]Beware of the horde of foes ahead.
[74:28.45]Like, you mean those guys?
[74:30.95]Alright, I gotta be careful, because this is my first shortcut.
[74:33.23]I don't want to fuck this up.
[74:34.01]I'm gonna bring them outside.
[74:36.65]Make them run.
[74:37.19]I don't want to get in a position where I'm gonna get, like, in trouble.
[74:43.11]Since when do these enemies have aggro range?
[74:48.29]Why?! !
[74:50.52]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[74:53.07]Don't swing twice.
[74:54.75]Do not swing twice.
[74:58.83]Come on, this fucking sword is so big.
[75:00.31]I can't even swing it.
[75:01.15]I'm hitting walls.
[75:06.61]Here he comes.
[75:07.17]Alright.
[75:07.67]I'm just gonna... Shit, there's two of them.
[75:11.39]Big swing.
[75:11.83]Come on.
[75:12.11]Big, big fucking swing.
[75:13.39]Get him in one hit.
[75:14.73]There it is.
[75:15.11]Okay, that's an overhit.
[75:17.40]That guy killed himself.
[75:18.26]Okay, we're good.
[75:19.70]He's dead, right?
[75:20.98]I think so?
[75:21.56]Yeah.
[75:22.26]He's dead.
[75:24.74]Watch out for those exploding barrels.
[75:27.84]That's all I need is for somebody to hit those exploding barrels if the meat die.
[75:30.91]And there's no falling attack.
[75:35.00]Don't get my... There's the shortcut right there.
[75:37.56]Do not fuck this up.
[75:40.40]It's an overhead swing.
[75:42.88]Overhead swing.
[75:43.94]That's all I need to do.
[75:45.49]You idiots.
[75:46.45]And they don't take any damage from this.
[75:48.09]Just... Okay.
[75:51.29]Alright.
[75:51.59]Good.
[75:54.07]There it is.
[75:54.67]Shortcut.
[75:59.50]Let's go get the items out here.
[76:00.74]We have the shortcut now.
[76:06.67]There's a Kling Ring.
[76:10.11]And these two things.
[76:11.63]Old Ragged... Finally, I get to put on some stuff.
[76:13.66]Old Ragged Clothes.
[76:15.02]Jade Hair Ornament.
[76:18.28]Alright, well, there's the shortcut.
[76:19.44]Let's go back.
[76:20.72]Should I... Can I go... Should I go back and, like, level up?
[76:24.20]I should, right?
[76:24.72]Yeah, perfect.
[76:27.55]Okay, cool.
[76:31.65]Let's go put on these clothes and check out some stuff and check out some things and check out some stuff.
[76:39.89]fashion yeah so let's do it turn to the nexus no what do you mean no no level up until after the first boss what oh okay so it is it's like Bloodborne then it's just like Bloodborne how can I not put this on
[77:12.91]Why can't I put this on?
[77:14.91]Female only?
[77:15.83]What?
[77:17.21]What do you mean, female only?
[77:22.10]I can't wear women's clothing?
[77:24.72]Are you kidding me?
[77:25.40]Why?
[77:28.32]Oh, that's good.
[77:29.12]Lose less HP when in soul squirm.
[77:30.82]Oh wow, that's beautiful.
[77:34.92]So wait, I can't... I have to go fight the first boss.
[77:37.19]I can't do anything.
[77:44.80]Alright, well... I guess we're gonna keep going.
[77:50.16]Although, I guess I have plenty of half moon.
[77:52.40]What does late moon do?
[77:53.35]Is that like a hot... Is that like a heal over time or something?
[77:58.81]You thought I was female.
[78:00.01]No, I'm not.
[78:08.06]So far, yeah.
[78:09.52]I could see myself...
[78:12.17]Just mechanically wise, I like this style of game.
[78:21.17]This feels more like Bloodborne than it does Dark Souls.
[78:24.12]So that's why I think I like this more.
[78:27.76]This is very preliminary, like we're in the first zone, first shortcut.
[78:31.38]That could change very quickly.
[78:34.08]But I do find it to be very, very good so far.
[78:39.43]At least in a mechanical sense.
[78:43.33]Bog wall?
[78:45.83]This is down to the right.
[78:47.01]Oh boy, this expands a little bit down here.
[78:49.19]Um, let's check it out.
[78:52.67]Bloodborne is basically Demon Slayer 2.
[78:56.23]Well, I'm glad I'm getting a chance.
[78:57.65]Holy frames.
[79:03.29]Go get that other dude?
[79:04.91]I will.
[79:05.59]You know what?
[79:05.93]Fine.
[79:06.09]We'll go do that first.
[79:10.07]Let's go take that guy out.
[79:11.73]What's this say?
[79:13.33]Don't stop.
[79:15.23]What?
[79:16.27]Wait a minute.
[79:18.19]What's that?
[79:20.09]Curious.
[79:21.74]What is this?
[79:22.92]Oh, shit!
[79:23.50]There's a thing!
[79:24.16]Wow!
[79:25.60]Wow!
[79:27.44]Crossbow!
[79:29.02]Not worth it.
[79:30.44]Told you so.
[79:31.18]For a crossbow.
[79:32.24]No thanks.
[79:37.83]Oh, this is where that guy went.
[79:40.69]Bye.
[79:43.55]Alright, well, turns out that wasn't worth it, because now I have to go back here again.
[79:52.92]Nice.
[79:53.48]Crossbow.
[79:56.74]Cool.
[79:59.02]Can't wait to not use that at all.
[80:00.84]Thanks, man.
[80:01.60]Thanks for the tip.
[80:06.26]Guy down.
[80:07.86]Just about.
[80:13.59]Alright, that other guy was... Where was that other guy?
[80:17.17]Straight away?
[80:18.65]Down like a little hall over here, right?
[80:20.69]No, not this way.
[80:24.07]I can jump certain ledges by walking.
[80:25.57]So what, it's like Legend of Zelda?
[80:29.33]Hold on, am I going the right way here?
[80:32.94]No, this is the way to go back down.
[80:34.96]It's the other way.
[80:38.72]So you can Legend of Zelda some ledges if you run off them.
[80:43.12]Death number one?
[80:44.78]Not yet.
[80:46.86]If I'm patient, I should be able to beat this guy.
[80:55.13]That guy just scared the shit out of me.
[80:57.97]Death counter one.
[80:59.17]You can't do a preliminary death counter.
[81:02.59]Do not preliminary death counter me.
[81:04.47]Use luring tactics.
[81:05.57]Sure.
[81:07.35]That's fine.
[81:08.47]You can't say I'm dead already.
[81:09.85]Alright, here we go.
[81:14.14]He's got a spear.
[81:14.96]Worst enemies.
[81:16.34]Enemies with spears are the worst.
[81:17.76]Like, I'm certain of that.
[81:22.52]Get him in the room.
[81:23.30]Watch out for the- Okay, I gotta watch out for like the book- Clear the fucking area.
[81:26.18]Clear the arena.
[81:39.61]The arena was all fucked up.
[81:41.11]The arena- That arena was not good.
[81:44.94]Oh, God.
[81:48.92]I had to clear, like, the stupid bookcase, and there are enemies here, it doesn't even matter.
[81:54.20]I made plenty of space to die, and I've used stamina to clear the fucking table.
[81:58.92]When, what the hell, FromSoftware?
[82:01.24]You usually can roll into shit, and it explodes.
[82:08.17]What ever happened to, like, rolling into things?
[82:11.21]Oh, DEAR!
[82:13.96]Wait, wait a minute, there's too many people here!
[82:21.28]Oh god, they're gonna blow themselves up.
[82:23.24]They're gonna blow up.
[82:24.34]I'm fine.
[82:24.86]We're fine.
[82:25.54]Everybody calm down.
[82:26.14]We're gonna fight them this time.
[82:26.96]I'm gonna kill them this time.
[82:31.24]Out of the way.
[82:33.11]No, no, no, no.
[82:36.89]Get out of my way.
[82:40.71]Forgot how far this was.
[82:43.23]Don't touch that.
[82:49.15]Okay.
[82:49.97]Now... Oh, shit.
[82:51.57]I do have to, like, clear this, though.
[82:53.89]There's, like, four or five enemies here that need to die.
[82:55.79]And we got, like, the fucking... We got the, like, dead space main character over here.
[83:00.45]Isaac.
[83:03.93]I don't know.
[83:04.63]We're not fighting Isaac right now.
[83:07.49]I'll stab this guy right in the back, though.
[83:10.17]Just because he was in the way.
[83:13.60]The Dead Space guy's right behind me still, isn't he?
[83:16.60]Isn't he?
[83:20.13]Of course he is.
[83:22.03]Oh, fuck.
[83:22.75]What have I done?
[83:24.91]Oh, what have I done?
[83:27.93]Oh, what have I done?
[83:28.91]It's okay.
[83:30.97]Easy.
[83:32.21]Just get the shit.
[83:33.19]Just get the thing you need.
[83:35.66]It's so much more elaborate and all over the screen than the other games.
[83:39.98]Come on.
[83:44.66]Come on, that should have been a backstab.
[83:46.04]I was 180 degrees behind him.
[83:53.43]No, no, no, we're back in the arena.
[83:54.73]Get out of the fucking arena!
[83:56.87]Get out of the arena!
[83:57.73]There's a guy right here.
[83:59.65]Jeez, thank god he's an idiot.
[84:01.57]Thank god this guy's brainless.
[84:03.77]Okay, one more hit and he's dead.
[84:10.90]What the fuck?
[84:12.70]Bullshit.
[84:15.89]No, don't, don't, don't, don't!
[84:16.73]I don't know what that does.
[84:19.39]I thought I had a heal.
[84:21.79]What does that do?
[84:22.30]Okay, this is a half heal.
[84:25.66]That's fine.
[84:29.84]Okay, I'm going to fight this guy out here.
[84:33.11]That's like an open space.
[84:33.99]There's no bookcases and shit everywhere.
[84:38.96]Fucking god, what the fuck?
[84:42.89]Dude, the dude has a joust ability.
[84:45.57]I didn't know that.
[84:46.33]I didn't know that the guy has a joust.
[84:48.15]He literally just like runs with the spear out.
[84:51.81]What the fuck, dude?
[84:52.87]Alright, now I know that.
[84:55.22]How am I supposed to know the guy has a literal joust?
[84:59.54]Usually they do an animation and you dodge it.
[85:01.34]No, he just is holding the spear out and don't touch it or it's gonna be like balloon pop.
[85:08.77]Fucking Balloon Pop.
[85:09.83]Okay, now I know that this game is just Balloon Pop with 3D graphics.
[85:13.65]Now I know.
[85:19.55]Damn it.
[85:25.30]Shit in my fucking diaper.
[85:37.72]So how are you supposed to fight?
[85:38.52]Yeah, okay, so you have to lure that guy.
[85:41.40]If you don't lure that guy, then he just does balloon pop to you and you just get hit, but you can't dodge it.
[85:46.49]There's no way to dodge.
[85:47.23]You can't dodge left or right.
[85:48.45]It's a fucking hallway.
[85:59.59]Okay, here we go.
[86:03.55]There's this guy over here.
[86:04.89]Let's do this slowly.
[86:08.74]No dicking around.
[86:10.18]Come get it.
[86:14.61]Shit, I'm gonna, like, fucking die to Isaac.
[86:16.41]These guys' animations are weird.
[86:23.75]I don't like them.
[86:28.98]Don't ask me how the fuck I hit him there.
[86:33.72]You heal...
[86:36.52]Fuck this guy.
[86:37.10]Fuck this guy.
[86:38.22]I just want to continue the game.
[86:39.68]Just get me out of this.
[86:44.72]And you know what?
[86:45.88]This sword sucks.
[86:47.26]I'm going back to the fucking club.
[86:50.52]What the hell are you doing?
[86:51.44]Swing the sword!
[86:56.04]This sword is a piece of crap.
[87:03.51]Get him with the backstab.
[87:04.45]Whaaat?
[87:07.60]Give me the fucking club back.
[87:12.67]Fuck my body.
[87:20.57]Yeah, I'm staying.
[87:21.53]I'm keeping the club.
[87:22.85]Fuck this.
[87:29.38]Club is like... That bastard sword is too big and sloppy.
[87:32.56]I don't want that thing anymore.
[87:36.76]This thing does more damage.
[87:40.96]Put the bastard sword into the garbage can where it belongs.
[87:42.98]Come on, do it again.
[87:56.47]It's too sloppy.
[87:57.21]It just is.
[87:57.79]It takes too long to do anything, and the club does more damage.
[88:02.39]Alright, let's get my shit.
[88:07.46]Where is it?
[88:08.62]Okay.
[88:09.06]Let's do this right.
[88:11.92]Bring it on.
[88:14.76]Wait.
[88:15.08]Wait a minute.
[88:17.86]Clear the arena.
[88:19.85]Sorry.
[88:20.13]Nobody can watch this event.
[88:22.21]There are no seats left.
[88:25.37]Now I'm ready to fight him in here.
[88:27.01]There's no boxes.
[88:28.27]There's no toy chests.
[88:29.91]There's no bricks or anything lying around.
[88:31.41]Let's go.
[88:34.92]Come at me.
[88:36.74]As they say.
[88:40.68]Come to the arena.
[88:41.76]Let's do it.
[88:43.30]Dodge the side with this guy.
[88:45.76]And that's a great lock-on we got there.
[88:47.32]That's a great lock-on we got there, folks.
[88:49.77]That's a great fucking lock-on.
[88:57.23]Oh my fucking god.
[88:58.61]What the fuck?
[88:59.63]I'm done with this guy.
[89:00.93]Jesus Christ.
[89:09.99]What?!
[89:11.15]Wha- I'm not fighting now, I'm coming back later.
[89:13.12]Fuck that guy.
[89:15.92]That fucking stupid joust!
[89:18.04]Just- Get, get, get, get, get!
[89:25.18]Fuck that stupid enemy.
[89:28.88]Just use the shield?
[89:29.78]No, if I use the shield, everyone's gonna make fun of me.
[89:32.26]Don't you know how these games work?
[89:34.90]If I put the shield on, everyone will say, oh, Gerber's using the shield, he sucks.
[89:40.42]You're not allowed to stream this game and use the shield.
[89:45.48]Just give him my shit.
[89:46.24]I'll come back and fight that guy later.
[89:47.50]I'm not fucking dying to his quarter of a frame startup animation to kill you in a second.
[89:52.90]No fucking way.
[89:53.50]I thought we were already making fun of you.
[89:59.94]No, you're not.
[90:09.43]Alright, get over here, you fucking dickhead.
[90:20.90]Bring it on.
[90:26.90]Alright, he's dead.
[90:28.21]I'm just gonna get my shit and I'm getting out of here.
[90:32.31]Your message was not sent, you're sending too many messages.
[90:38.55]We got slow mode?
[90:45.87]You can't say dickhead.
[90:46.65]This is a PG-13 stream.
[90:51.81]No, you can't.
[90:52.59]No swearing.
[90:56.69]You know, honestly, everybody has a thing in these games that's like the bane of their entire existence.
[91:01.31]Guys with spears in mind.
[91:04.29]Like, in every FromSoftware game, if a guy has a fucking spear...
[91:09.78]I will first try a boss in this game.
[91:11.58]But like if a guy has a fucking spear in his hand, I'm gonna die every time.
[91:16.50]Like every single fucking time.
[91:17.76]Alright, fuck this.
[91:20.28]We're going.
[91:32.61]I'm gonna love this boss.
[91:34.27]Does the first boss have a spear?
[91:36.03]Don't tell me that.
[91:37.68]Don't tell me the first boss has a spear.
[91:42.48]Alright, let's move on.
[91:43.24]I'm gonna like shake out those... I gotta shake that out of my system.
[91:55.55]Alright, hold on.
[91:56.09]We gotta... Nope.
[91:58.61]Not gonna happen this time.
[92:02.72]Anybody else in this room?
[92:04.66]Just a lot of explosives.
[92:11.84]Beware of the enemy ambush, yeah?
[92:14.22]Does that mean behind or what?
[92:18.76]Hopefully that doesn't mean behind.
[92:20.02]That's what they meant by enemy ambush.
[92:30.68]Well, that's just wonderful.
[92:33.04]A merchant lies in wait ahead, really.
[92:36.07]Very cool, very cool.
[92:38.96]Merchant, you say, huh?
[92:43.93]Am I gonna get like... Wow, this guy's creepy.
[92:48.27]Uh, who are you?
[92:48.67]Okay.
[92:49.31]What do you got?
[92:50.19]This guy sells crescent moon grass.
[92:52.49]How much are these?
[92:53.21]400.
[92:53.23]Ugh.
[92:53.37]Alright, just tell me now.
[93:09.82]Just get it out of the way, guys, in the chat.
[93:12.58]Should I not be buying these, or should I just try to pick them up?
[93:18.40]Is purchasing these a bad idea?
[93:21.88]Because enemies drop them?
[93:23.19]Or should I buy a stack of these?
[93:27.79]Buy the spear.
[93:28.67]No, I'm not using a spear.
[93:32.19]What about the longsword?
[93:34.41]No.
[93:34.73]D.
[93:38.48]Ooh, armor.
[93:39.02]This is heavy though.
[93:40.22]I don't have enough to buy this whole thing.
[93:47.09]I could buy the chest.
[93:48.89]Or the legs or something.
[93:55.04]Enemies dropped them.
[93:59.08]The longsword's actually a good weapon, is it?
[94:03.90]How should I know?
[94:04.58]I hate video games.
[94:10.82]I could just buy the helmet.
[94:16.31]I'm going to stick with the turkey leg for now.
[94:20.13]There's only two rolls.
[94:20.97]There's fat roll and there's no in between.
[94:25.25]No, I'm going to buy the shredder helmet.
[94:31.69]And I'm going to buy some of these.
[94:34.60]I like five of them.
[94:42.91]Don't cover up my face?
[94:43.95]Well, I mean, this is your last chance you're gonna get to look at it.
[94:45.89]There you go.
[94:54.34]Can you sell?
[94:54.93]I don't think so.
[94:56.18]I can only buy.
[94:57.38]Buying armor in a Souls game?
[94:58.96]Well, didn't you do that in... In Bloodborne, you bought your first set, the hunter gear?
[95:03.40]That was a thing that was considered not a bad idea, was buying your first set of items.
[95:06.76]Because I can't...
[95:25.00]I can't level up right now, so if I lose my souls, then it's bad.
[95:28.13]So, might as well just get something.
[95:29.93]Alright, let's take a look.
[95:33.37]Okay.
[95:37.23]We're good.
[95:40.79]Let me go into my equipment here.
[95:45.81]Command menu.
[95:47.91]Reorganize.
[95:48.91]No.
[95:49.43]How do I... Right here, right?
[95:52.71]Yeah, there we go.
[95:54.52]Let's get this off.
[95:55.36]Get this off.
[95:57.00]Let me get this cleaner.
[96:00.16]Half moon.
[96:01.76]Late moon.
[96:02.28]Recover a large amount of HP.
[96:03.72]So this is just a huge... Recover all HP.
[96:06.44]Okay.
[96:09.79]Heals bleeding.
[96:10.75]What else do I got?
[96:13.12]Recover a large amount of MP.
[96:14.74]I don't need that right now.
[96:15.96]Attracts those hungry for souls.
[96:17.50]Alright, that's fine.
[96:18.50]Let's have heals on.
[96:19.26]There we go.
[96:23.06]Let's use one right now.
[96:25.44]Let's keep going.
[96:28.90]I look like I used the Schwartz.
[96:31.60]Ah, I see your Schwartz.
[96:32.70]It's as big as mine.
[96:35.35]What a classic movie.
[96:39.03]Item behind this?
[96:42.41]Nope.
[96:46.29]Down?
[96:48.76]Or up?
[96:49.80]Oh, a lot of dudes.
[96:55.26]Okay.
[96:56.94]Sure.
[96:57.96]Okay, well.
[97:00.70]That's fine.
[97:08.33]Easy.
[97:09.49]Don't get hit by the scrunches!
[97:12.61]I don't know what that means, sorry.
[97:16.24]I was going for something that I had to concentrate before I had to go for something, then concentrate.
[97:19.84]Didn't really work out so well, huh?
[97:21.72]A lot of crossbow users here.
[97:25.82]Let's just circle around.
[97:27.29]This looks like I can get over there, huh?
[97:30.81]I can definitely get over there.

[98:33.67]What a terrible sneaking job that was.
[98:36.97]Late moon grass.
[98:38.39]I can go down there.
[98:39.25]Is this a boss?
[98:47.72]I don't know.
[98:48.62]Probably not.
[98:49.16]Let me just wait.
[98:50.22]Let me look down here again.
[98:53.58]I backstabbed that guy with a club in my hand.
[98:56.53]I'm full of all kinds of surprises.
[99:03.02]Let me... I got dead.
[99:07.30]Wait, what is that doing?
[99:11.27]Just a shield.
[99:13.23]Alright.
[99:14.93]Oh, I could go down there, but I don't know if I want to.
[99:22.21]For the sake of exploration, though, I think I am going to check out down here.
[99:26.44]Just because.
[99:28.70]Just because I feel like it, you know?
[99:34.55]Uh-huh.
[99:39.60]I thought that was pretty solid, but it's alright.
[99:45.56]Yeah, I thought that was a solid parry, but you know, it's okay.
[99:49.02]Sometimes you don't get them.
[99:55.93]God, stop being so greedy.
[99:59.83]fight the boss.
[100:00.75]I will.
[100:01.09]I just want to see what's down here.
[100:02.59]There might be a weapon that's going to solve all my problems.
[100:05.95]There might be another.
[100:06.49]There might be a bigger turkey leg here.
[100:07.85]Oh god.
[100:14.79]Hit him.
[100:16.53]Hit him.
[100:22.67]Can't parry the jumping attacks?
[100:25.45]Why?
[100:25.67]Why?
[100:28.72]This looks destroyable.
[100:30.66]It is.
[100:36.09]Quest for drumsticks.
[100:37.19]Wee!
[100:41.95]Right.
[100:43.95]Take a right.
[100:46.29]Okay.
[100:47.85]We're in like some guy's laboratory now.
[100:53.02]This really does remind me of the first area in Dark Souls 3.
[100:55.68]A big, sprawling zone.
[100:57.64]I like it.
[100:58.96]Someday.
[101:00.68]I've been in soul form for so long.
[101:04.09]What is he saying?
[101:04.59]Someday he'll learn how to play the piano?
[101:05.89]That's what I thought that was.
[101:06.61]I thought it was a piano.
[101:07.29]Alright, well let's kill this guy.
[101:14.57]This guy's different.
[101:17.37]This guy doesn't have a shield.
[101:19.11]No matter.
[101:24.40]Well, he's quicker.
[101:30.51]He's quicker than the other ones.
[101:35.85]Half moon.
[101:39.79]I do like this little heal.
[101:41.63]Feels nice.
[101:42.90]To be able to do stuff.
[101:44.62]I'm in trouble.
[101:45.20]Please recommend it.
[101:46.50]And why does this have 4,000 upvotes?
[101:51.34]Is this poison?
[101:55.69]This shit's got, they always have like thousands of upvotes.
[101:59.66]Why?
[102:07.74]Like four thousand upvotes on that, on that same joke?
[102:11.66]Is that the praise the sun of Demon's Souls?
[102:13.72]It has to be.
[102:17.78]Praise the sun.
[102:24.96]I'm going way out of the way here.
[102:29.32]Well, this is the end of this road.
[102:30.48]A lot of people down here, though.
[102:37.26]This feels like somebody just copy and pasted a bunch of enemies down here.
[102:43.74]Is that what happened?
[102:48.87]I wouldn't be surprised.
[102:51.27]We're going to take this slow.
[102:54.33]Let's wait for the dash, and then jump around it.
[102:56.53]Come on.
[102:58.23]Hello?
[103:02.43]Firebomb?
[103:03.41]Yeah, I could do that, but... I don't have it equipped, so we're not gonna do it.
[103:08.03]We're gonna pull them out piece by piece.
[103:09.45]We're gonna, like, do an aggro run.
[103:15.47]You know what?
[103:17.49]After this guy.
[103:23.90]I'll firebomb him.
[103:27.68]Firebomb.
[103:29.32]Let's put it on.
[103:30.30]Just get it on there.
[103:31.18]Why not?
[103:33.42]I never used any of these items.
[103:35.26]Like, ever.
[103:35.64]I'm not exactly sure why.
[103:38.92]Alright, uh, we're gonna throw it at this guy.
[103:41.94]Here, take this.
[103:42.62]Ooh, boy!
[103:51.11]Come on out.
[103:51.81]Why don't we do it again?
[103:53.67]Take this!
[103:57.47]See?
[103:58.07]That was cool, wasn't it?
[104:01.47]They're all guarding something.
[104:10.33]That's a double- that's a double turkey stab!
[104:14.05]I'll take it.
[104:16.29]And what's the actual item?
[104:18.05]Shard of Hard Stone, Shard of Sharp Stone.
[104:21.60]I'm going to assume those are the... Hi.
[104:23.76]Okay.
[104:25.72]I'm going to assume those are like the fragments to upgrade your weapons.
[104:29.00]Right?
[104:30.50]At this point, they kind of have to be.
[104:35.66]Mouse WM1.
[104:36.80]What are you talking about WM1?
[104:40.27]Like Titanite?
[104:40.83]Yeah.
[104:41.17]Let's go.
[104:41.77]Treasure Ahead.
[104:42.41]Where?
[104:42.57]What do you mean Treasure Ahead?
[104:44.83]I think he's talking about the treasure I already got.
[104:54.35]Let's go back.
[104:56.41]I think I've explored the entirety of this area.
[104:58.39]Maybe not over here, though.
[105:01.35]What was over here?
[105:03.61]Oh, I hear somebody.
[105:04.19]I mean, I hear... Okay.
[105:09.72]New weapon type.
[105:10.66]That guy's gonna flail.
[105:11.46]Let's get him around the corner line of sight.
[105:19.46]Bingo.
[105:23.65]This is my favorite part about playing these games.
[105:25.31]It's just kind of looking around.
[105:28.71]Scimitar.
[105:29.81]What scaling does that have?
[105:34.75]I've got to get this off.
[105:41.61]E scaling.
[105:42.29]No, it's not worth having.
[105:45.87]How do I unequip this?
[105:46.63]There we go.
[105:51.05]It's a weird looking flail.
[105:52.33]Mace, not a flail.
[105:53.29]It was making the... It was making that sound.
[106:02.28]And this is how we take care of this.
[106:07.06]This is how we take care of this one.
[106:10.65]Who the fuck is that?
[106:12.35]I'm trying to do...
[106:20.16]That's what I was trying to do.
[106:21.10]Are we going to fight this guy?
[106:24.26]Of course I do.
[106:29.00]Of course you will.
[106:31.30]I swear to God, I'll kill them all.
[106:33.89]Of course you will.
[106:39.39]In one hour.
[106:40.89]Thought I could get the invulnerability there, but I didn't get it.
[106:49.72]Third time's the charm.
[106:50.90]Alright, what were you hiding inside of your little... burrow?
[106:55.51]Any sweets?
[106:56.59]Nope.
[106:57.59]No sweets.
[107:00.92]I am about to fight that invasion dude.
[107:05.91]Heal.
[107:06.23]Alright, let's be careful here.
[107:09.99]I don't know where the hell is he.
[107:11.49]Is this a... What?
[107:15.43]I already helped you.
[107:17.49]Oh.
[107:18.15]Is this guy gonna... Is this double cross?
[107:20.48]I can smell a double cross from a mile away.
[107:21.94]This looks like a double cross.
[107:23.86]Double cross?
[107:25.50]Whoa.
[107:27.08]That's a cool shield.
[107:31.04]Is this guy... Should I just backstab him right now?
[107:32.66]Is he gonna double cross?
[107:35.86]my thanks for your brave rescue.
[107:38.10]I am Ostrava of Boletaria.
[107:40.40]Accept this as a token of my gratitude.
[107:42.42]There's, like, real NPC.
[107:44.30]Brass Telescope.
[107:47.88]You have a really cool Disney Keyblade.
[107:49.64]I want that.
[107:49.98]Now I must go.
[107:51.48]There is something for me to take care of.
[107:54.69]I just, like, started phase one of his quest that's gonna last to, like, halfway through the game, right?
[107:58.97]No matter how far I venture, only the soul-starved remain.
[108:03.95]Is there a...
[108:06.26]Anything else?
[108:08.14]No matter how far I venture, is there a single sane person?
[108:12.11]Alright, well, what about anything left in here?
[108:13.55]Or is that all?
[108:14.09]Did I clean this whole area up?
[108:17.37]I believe I did.
[108:18.31]Okay, let's go.
[108:21.43]Kill?
[108:23.25]No.
[108:23.89]You guys think I can kill this guy?
[108:24.97]Look, I'm, like, naked with a club.
[108:27.31]You think I'm gonna fight, like, fucking Mickey from the Function of Thirteen?
[108:31.30]Whatever the hell that... What was the name of that thing?
[108:35.21]What was the name of that, that, the council of 13, the 13th people?
[108:39.42]What was it?
[108:42.14]Going the wrong way.
[108:46.92]No, not Epic Mickey.
[108:48.67]The 13.
[108:51.41]Organization 13.
[108:51.97]Yeah.
[108:56.75]right let's just go back uh so I gotta go I gotta go gotta go I gotta pee too speaking of going I gotta pee bad real bad you know what I'm saying real bad so this brings me back this way and through here right I can remember where I was going no this way
[109:27.20]I didn't go all the way down.
[109:28.78]There's like a secret I probably could have gotten, but... You know.
[109:33.21]There's the merchant.
[109:36.25]I wonder if I should buy something else.
[109:38.77]I feel like I should just buy the chest piece.
[109:40.97]What do you guys think?
[109:42.47]I think I'm just gonna buy the chest piece.
[109:43.75]I am.
[109:44.97]I'm probably... Everyone's gonna scream at me.
[109:46.17]It's gonna be like, Dude, no, don't... What are you doing?
[109:48.60]Hello!
[109:51.48]But if I die to the boss, then you lose the souls.
[109:53.68]It's just like in Bloodborne.
[109:55.18]No?
[109:55.50]What do you mean?
[109:55.92]Why?
[109:56.16]Why?
[109:56.38]Why?
[109:58.13]Why not?
[110:01.36]Vote nay.
[110:01.88]Vote no.
[110:02.30]What are you doing?
[110:03.68]No.
[110:04.30]Buy the legs.
[110:08.80]I'm buying the legs.
[110:09.62]And then I'm going to buy... Honestly, because I don't want to... What if I die to the boss like three times?
[110:21.83]Go level up?
[110:22.41]I can't.
[110:24.21]I can't level up to fight the first boss, right?
[110:29.53]Isn't that the consensus there?
[110:34.07]I can't level up?
[110:37.45]Until I get to the first boss or something?
[110:43.09]Is that true?
[110:45.05]I can level up.
[110:46.33]Was I just getting trolled in the video chat?
[110:52.61]So you're telling me that the video chatters here were trolling me?
[110:57.94]And I can't level up at the Nexus?
[111:02.02]Okay.
[111:02.50]Let me, like... I could have leveled up.
[111:07.24]Wow!
[111:07.88]I almost just walked down there.
[111:11.13]Where the fuck was I going?
[111:14.11]I'm, like, lost already.
[111:17.65]No, they were not trolling.
[111:18.95]Okay.
[111:22.02]Where the hell was I going?
[111:22.76]There's, like, a fog gate, right?
[111:24.54]Did I miss it?
[111:27.15]I didn't, like, miss the fog gate, did I?
[111:28.45]Where the fuck was it?
[111:33.33]The level up lady is not there until you beat this boss.
[111:35.84]Yeah, okay, so, yeah, so it makes sense to at least, like, give myself a chance.
[111:44.72]Where is that fog gate?
[111:48.97]I've lost all control.
[111:50.17]I forget what that fog gate is.
[111:51.91]It's definitely not this way.
[111:59.52]Maybe it is this way.
[112:03.16]I don't fucking remember.
[112:07.53]I'm gonna lash out.
[112:13.97]Jesus Christ.
[112:17.03]Okay, here.
[112:17.81]It's right here.
[112:18.85]Okay, here we go.
[112:19.33]Let's see what this is.
[112:22.12]Not a boss.
[112:23.98]Not quite a boss.
[112:26.20]At least not right here.
[112:32.32]Well, there- there- there look- Those people?
[112:36.60]What are these?
[112:39.24]Oh god, what is with this weird like fucking clogged drain?
[112:45.76]This is a clogged toilet.
[112:48.86]Where's the plunger?
[112:52.85]Jesus, really?
[112:54.95]Really?
[112:59.71]Oh, the crows.
[113:00.27]No, not the crows.
[113:00.97]What the hell was... What?
[113:04.59]Hold on.
[113:05.99]What did I just do?
[113:08.65]I just got the multiball on the pinball machine somehow.
[113:11.17]Well, thanks.
[113:12.51]Appreciate it.
[113:15.43]Thanks for the fucking multiball.
[113:20.87]I told you I was fucking good at these games.
[113:26.23]Anything else over here?
[113:30.74]The game took sympathy on me.
[113:33.96]There's the Flare.
[113:34.56]There's the Drano.
[113:40.51]Oh, come on.
[113:40.91]I had to jump on him too.
[113:45.35]Unfortunately, I probably could have followed up with that, but I didn't.
[113:50.91]Out of the way.
[113:59.09]Where the fuck did you get those bombs?
[114:00.13]Mm-hmm.
[114:06.91]Mm-hmm.
[114:09.46]No!
[114:09.66]Okay, we're good.
[114:14.56]I want to take the fire bombs off.
[114:16.16]I think.
[114:17.74]I think.
[114:19.44]Spear guys are annoying?
[114:20.36]Yeah, because they have a spear.
[114:23.46]You understand?
[114:24.08]Like, it's just a spear.
[114:25.55]I'm in trouble.
[114:26.05]Please recommend this to your friends.
[114:27.85]I'm in trouble.
[114:28.53]Listen to me.
[114:29.01]Uh, is this an elevator?
[114:31.47]I don't know.
[114:34.53]Hold up the fucking turkey leg.
[114:36.37]Beware of dangerous foe ahead.
[114:41.67]Um.
[114:45.27]Where?
[114:46.70]Where are you?
[114:50.06]Oh, God.
[114:52.92]There he is.
[114:54.76]There's two dragons?
[114:58.03]Beginners should try this area later.
[115:01.41]Don't go over here.
[115:02.71]Okay.
[115:07.21]I don't think I want to fight two full-sized dragons at level zero soul level.
[115:13.34]Help, I'm in trouble.
[115:14.16]Subscribe to my YouTube channel.
[115:21.08]What?
[115:21.82]I got that.
[115:26.20]Beware of fire.
[115:28.79]One of the dragons is gonna wrap around and... Look, I've seen your fucking... I know how you saw the person in half.
[115:35.93]Look, watch.
[115:36.95]You're gonna saw the person in half.
[115:38.77]Right now, here it comes.
[115:42.00]Come on, do it.
[115:44.14]There's two people in that fucking box.
[115:45.70]I know how it works.
[115:47.88]Where's the fire?
[115:48.84]Where's the... I told you!
[115:50.64]There's two people in that box.
[115:53.04]One of them scrunches up in the last box.
[115:57.74]And the other one's in the front.
[115:58.70]It's a lady that's like a contortionist.
[116:00.82]Alright, stop this.
[116:01.68]Stop this nonsense and fight.
[116:03.72]Where am I?
[116:10.16]I hate you.
[116:10.80]I hate you for having that long stick.
[116:16.40]Get out of here.
[116:25.48]There we go.
[116:26.78]Alright, let's go.
[116:30.52]I'm in trouble.
[116:32.52]Like this video if you like.
[116:34.26]Come on, where is he?
[116:37.09]Bring out the blade.
[116:38.05]Here it comes.
[116:40.41]Come on.
[116:41.85]I just have to stand over here and I'm not going to get hit by the fire.
[116:44.75]That's how this always works.
[116:46.75]Where's the dragon?
[116:47.52]Where are you?
[116:49.54]There you are.
[116:50.00]Okay.
[116:50.72]I just stand to the side.
[116:52.42]He goes a lane down.
[116:54.80]And then he breathes fire down the lane.
[116:58.75]Not at me though.
[116:59.67]Because I'm in a safe spot.
[117:06.53]Oh!
[117:08.48]Oh!
[117:08.70]He's doing it again!
[117:10.28]He's gonna do it again!
[117:12.16]Jesus Christ!
[117:16.48]Huh?
[117:17.84]We don't have time for this.
[117:19.78]I don't got time for this.
[117:21.88]I don't got time for this.
[117:23.97]I'm in trouble.
[117:24.43]Please fucking subscribe to my fucking Twitch channel.
[117:34.19]Oh my god.
[117:40.83]Why are those guys still alive?
[117:42.17]Why are they immune to fire?
[117:43.65]That's not fair.
[117:44.33]Those two guys are immune to fire?
[117:47.32]Cut the tail.
[117:48.76]Right?
[117:49.00]Isn't that what everyone should be screaming at me?
[117:51.12]And look at this.
[117:51.54]We got a shortcut, right?
[117:53.34]Baby.
[117:54.66]Shortcut.
[117:59.63]Or maybe not.
[118:00.21]I don't know.
[118:04.05]Yep.
[118:04.79]This is the front gate.
[118:05.93]We got it.
[118:09.57]Those two are in a blind spot.
[118:11.02]So if I stand there, am I going to die?
[118:12.20]What the hell was that?
[118:16.06]What?
[118:19.14]Okay.
[118:21.14]Well, that's the front door.
[118:23.56]What else is down here?
[118:26.87]I gotta look.
[118:27.43]I gotta pee.
[118:28.41]Bad.
[118:29.55]I gotta pee really badly.
[118:30.65]I thought that was a phantom.
[118:41.34]You'll find an item past here.
[118:43.68]Did I miss something?
[118:44.52]I hate missing things.
[118:47.72]Can't pee until the first boss is beaten, that's not- I'm gonna pee my pants.
[118:51.70]I will piss my pants.
[118:53.33]Turpentine, in case you need- in case you're doing like a paint job somewhere.
[118:55.85]Nah, I'll pee my pants, I really will.
[119:00.23]I will get frustrated, I'll be like, STUPID FUCK, and like, piss will come out, and I'll be really embarrassed.
[119:06.51]There, here's like another... Okay.
[119:10.41]So how do I- how do I get back?
[119:12.31]Is there like a wraparound to get back to the front?
[119:16.72]Yep.
[119:17.07]Okay, hold on.
[119:17.55]I'll be right back.
[119:18.07]I gotta pee.
[119:18.63]Bad.
[119:18.83]Be right back.
[122:59.62]Yeah.
[123:45.13]He's back.
[123:48.31]What a long pee.
[123:49.05]Yeah, I got a lot.
[123:50.35]Look, I'm telling you.
[123:55.45]That was the first break of the evening.
[123:56.67]We've been going for two hours.
[123:57.63]You know what you guys know?
[123:58.19]I pee every, like, 37 minutes.
[124:02.70]I got a lot of pee in me.
[124:05.60]Like, when I go out... Let me tell you guys some very intimate details about my life.
[124:10.16]When I go out... Okay, make sure you can, like, hear the game.
[124:16.81]No, nobody tell him.
[124:17.39]Nobody tell me what.
[124:19.49]What?
[124:19.77]Nobody tell him.
[124:21.41]Nobody tell him.
[124:22.13]A guy tried to kill him.
[124:23.09]It was fucking... A guy tried to kill this guy.
[124:25.65]No, he didn't.
[124:29.03]You know who tried to kill this guy?
[124:31.01]Me.
[124:32.61]Did you think there'd be a hint?
[124:33.62]Whoa!
[124:34.18]No, I didn't.
[124:34.74]But I knew there was going to be this guy.
[124:45.61]Oh, don't give me this shit right now.
[124:47.43]Not like in a little enclosed space.
[124:50.01]I can't have unlucky number 13 either.
[124:54.23]This room is too dark.
[124:55.39]I don't like it.
[124:56.52]And I can see you.
[124:58.16]In the mist.
[124:58.98]In the shadows.
[124:59.60]Good thing I was blocking, otherwise I would have hurt a lot.
[125:08.87]I haven't even realized yet.
[125:09.95]Realize what?
[125:11.05]What am I realizing?
[125:11.99]What's going on?
[125:13.69]What am I supposed to be realizing?
[125:14.67]What happened?
[125:18.68]I don't understand what I'm supposed to realize.
[125:19.94]I'm just trying to get back to the starting zone.
[125:27.63]Will he die from that?
[125:29.23]Of course he will.
[125:33.01]You never find out what's going to happen when I go out.
[125:37.03]What is that thing?
[125:38.05]What is that thing?
[125:40.13]What is that?
[125:41.61]It's like a blob with a shield.
[125:44.26]It's a shield blob.
[125:46.70]What?
[125:46.96]What the fuck?
[125:48.44]What is this?
[125:50.26]It's too dark.
[125:50.72]I can't see.
[125:51.10]Can I?
[125:56.96]Okay, you have to get like behind the blob for the two damage.
[125:59.62]Just like... Sharpstone.
[126:02.91]Okay.
[126:07.21]A spear.
[126:07.97]A spear blob.
[126:08.85]Well, that's cool.
[126:13.98]And there's a treasure ahead.
[126:16.31]It's there.
[126:18.35]Great view.
[126:21.99]I'm so glad to be playing one of these games again.
[126:26.57]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[126:29.97]These games... Look, I've complained a lot about Souls games.
[126:34.11]Every time you see me play one, I'm always like, Developers are so stupid.
[126:37.41]I hate them.
[126:38.29]What a shitty game.
[126:40.13]You hear me talk.
[126:40.89]But these are some of my favorite games ever made.
[126:43.80]Bloodborne is in my top five best game I've ever played in my life.
[126:48.92]And it's sad that there's only four of these experiences.
[126:53.53]I'm gonna cherish it.
[126:54.97]So we're gonna sit here for a minute.
[126:56.41]And cherish this.
[127:02.43]Okay.
[127:04.30]Okay.
[127:07.04]Okay.
[127:07.24]Nice.
[127:08.04]Nice.
[127:14.44]I can't backstab it.
[127:15.84]That's fine.
[127:18.98]Large stone, whatever that means.
[127:22.07]Some more grass.
[127:27.39]I see another blob.
[127:29.31]I'm in trouble.
[127:32.11]Because it's been more than ten years.
[127:33.89]Can somebody explain that joke to me?
[127:36.59]I understand the praise the sun joke.
[127:38.18]I do.
[127:39.16]Praise the sun is...
[127:41.68]Praise the sun.
[127:42.46]I'm the guy with the sun armor.
[127:44.23]And I say praise the sun.
[127:45.53]You don't kill me.
[127:46.41]I'm sun bro.
[127:47.73]Right.
[127:47.99]What's the joke here?
[127:49.35]What is that joke?
[127:55.39]What is that particular funny joke?
[128:01.25]Why have I not played the best souls game, Dark Souls 1?
[128:04.03]Because I tried.
[128:05.21]I got like a third of the way through the game.
[128:06.63]And I didn't like the travel.
[128:09.58]I just couldn't do it.
[128:12.66]I know it's a huge part of the game.
[128:14.18]The whole world's connected.
[128:15.60]It's fucking awesome.
[128:16.48]It's really cool.
[128:17.18]But I just don't want to walk around and backtrack like Resident Evil 1.
[128:20.69]I don't want to go through the mansion again.
[128:22.55]You know what I mean?
[128:23.15]I don't want to go through the fucking mansion.
[128:25.47]And get a key and then run through the mansion I saw nine hours ago.
[128:31.43]I don't want to do that.
[128:34.63]You get the warp like halfway through.
[128:39.28]Yeah, but I like...
[128:41.98]I beat Blighttown, so I completed Blighttown.
[128:45.91]And then I said to myself, oh cool, that was crazy hard, that was ridiculous.
[128:49.87]Alright, awesome.
[128:50.73]And then the game was like, alright, sir, if you'd like to, can you please go all the way back through all of Blighttown again?
[128:57.24]And I'm just like, you know, ma'am, I don't think I want to do that.
[128:59.88]Thank you for your time, but this interview is over and we're going to give the position to somebody else.
[129:04.86]And that was Bloodborne.
[129:05.76]That got the job.
[129:07.28]That was, like, Dark Souls 3.
[129:08.90]That actually got the job.
[129:10.62]I'm not... I am not, by any stretch of the means, ignoring the qualifications of Dark Souls 1.
[129:16.10]But you just didn't get the job.
[129:16.90]You weren't right for my company.
[129:28.49]There's an alternate way out.
[129:31.49]You weren't shown it to me.
[129:43.41]Should I go buy something?
[129:44.89]Should I go like upgrade this?
[129:46.57]Should I go?
[129:47.49]Maybe I will.
[129:50.41]I really don't want to like use the turkey leg though.
[129:52.23]Let's go store some shit.
[129:53.33]Hold on.
[129:53.67]I'm not ready for this.
[129:56.34]Yes, I am.
[129:57.06]Whatever.
[130:04.02]Just go.
[130:04.72]I have no idea what the fuck this boss is or what it does.
[130:06.94]Might as well just throw myself into the abyss.
[130:11.79]Touch bloodstain.
[130:12.77]Okay, I know how it looks.
[130:13.81]Beware of the darkness.
[130:14.65]Here's the first boss.
[130:15.49]Cool.
[130:15.91]First boss.
[130:18.11]Let's go.
[130:19.73]And the first boss is... Phalanx.
[130:21.94]Phalanx.
[130:25.40]Phalanx.
[130:30.70]It's a gigantic spear boss.
[130:32.92]It's a blob with spears.
[130:34.16]I'm in trouble!
[130:40.24]Help me!
[130:41.16]Recommend my videos to your friends!
[130:45.08]Oh my god, are you serious?
[130:48.44]Of all the shit I was complaining about, the boss?
[130:50.53]The first boss is just a spear?
[130:55.13]Are they all connected?
[130:56.37]I don't think they're all connected.
[130:59.28]Doesn't seem like it.
[131:02.03]If I kill this, does that do any damage to the boss?
[131:06.19]Ow.
[131:06.89]Okay, I don't think so.
[131:07.93]What did he drop?
[131:08.77]Oh my god.
[131:10.27]Hold on.
[131:11.03]Give me a minute.
[131:14.35]It's just a pile of... How do I get close?
[131:18.73]Holy shit!
[131:21.05]Are they... There's too many of these!
[131:23.62]I feel like there's too many.
[131:24.48]I feel like my game broke.
[131:25.48]Are there supposed to be this many?
[131:27.90]Oh my god, they're everywhere!
[131:29.32]What's that thing on the back?
[131:30.06]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[131:33.40]Everybody calm down, I figured it out.
[131:40.85]I have too many things in my inventory.
[131:43.67]There's too many things to throw at.
[131:46.65]Okay, we figured it out.
[131:48.77]I got this shit.
[131:52.28]No, I gotta throw it higher.
[131:54.68]Throw it higher, you fool!
[131:58.85]And then get in there and fucking smash.
[132:01.47]Ow.
[132:03.21]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[132:12.38]Get out of the way, you fucking little shits.
[132:18.84]Oh god, this sucks.
[132:21.32]So you don't, you gotta watch out for the front spears.
[132:24.78]I just, I wish it wasn't so dark.
[132:26.65]What is this?
[132:29.24]Sharp stone.
[132:29.89]Okay.
[132:30.39]That's fine.
[132:32.33]I almost want to put the brightness up.
[132:33.57]I can't see half of these guys.
[132:34.63]No, that ain't going to work.
[132:44.06]I'm going to run out of fire bombs here in a second.
[132:47.34]Here we go.
[132:52.00]Here we go.
[132:55.97]Burn them all.
[133:00.99]Okay.
[133:02.01]That easy.
[133:03.05]One more.
[133:05.90]Okay, we're good.
[133:08.56]He's gonna try to spin around on me.
[133:11.82]Easy, easy, easy.
[133:12.84]Don't get cocky.
[133:14.76]We played it.
[133:15.18]We just... Overconfidence is a slow and insane killer.
[133:19.30]I'm out of firebombs, though.
[133:25.71]He's in a spot that I don't like.
[133:31.91]Two hits.
[133:32.31]That's three hits, of course it is.
[133:33.89]Ow.
[133:35.79]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[133:37.59]If they drop firebombs, they might.
[133:38.95]It's worth a shot to check.
[133:40.43]I don't know if he's going to keep spawning these fucking things.
[133:46.71]Not confident enough?
[133:47.77]No, I don't want to get too confident.
[133:50.17]We've got to be careful.
[133:52.03]I wish I could see.
[133:52.78]I wish I could see!
[133:54.74]I wish I could see!
[133:57.66]I wish I could see!
[134:04.34]It was just a shard.
[134:05.10]Well, whatever.
[134:05.68]We got an opportunity to hit.
[134:08.40]Come on.
[134:08.72]Fuck that.
[134:12.36]Overconfidence is a blob with spears.
[134:19.05]Gotta get up his backside.
[134:20.09]Watch out for those spears.
[134:24.85]Don't get sucked in.
[134:25.39]What's he doing?
[134:26.13]He just did like a vacuum move.
[134:27.31]I don't know what the fuck that was.
[134:32.46]I'm in a pretty good spot, though.
[134:37.11]Easy.
[134:37.37]Don't get stabbed.
[134:39.23]Don't make this about you.
[134:40.11]It's not about you.
[134:40.87]This is just like the spider boss.
[134:48.43]Oh, fuck.
[134:49.11]That's too many.
[134:51.03]What was it?
[134:51.47]A Rom.
[134:52.26]This is just like Romulan.
[134:54.48]Romstein.
[134:55.98]Ramstein.
[134:56.50]What was that guy's name?
[134:57.10]What was the boss?
[134:57.60]Alright, shut up, Jeremy.
[135:02.84]Shut up, Jeremy.
[135:03.44]Like, just fucking beat the boss.
[135:04.46]Stop trying to make, like, Ramstein jokes.

[135:19.30]Insidious.
[135:23.87]Yeah, Ramstein, the Dark Souls bot.
[135:26.59]He's almost dead.
[135:28.19]I got him in a good spot over here.
[135:29.35]Nope, he's gonna spin around.
[135:31.69]Then I will run around with you.
[135:36.57]No, no, not an opportunity.
[135:37.86]Let's get rid of you.

[136:27.82]Let me get... World record.
[136:35.08]Dude, I can't imagine how many streamers or people that...
[136:43.69]play this game all the time.
[136:44.61]That guy probably dies in like three swings.
[136:48.85]Let's try to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[136:49.95]Alright, let's go back in.
[136:52.33]Now I can level up, I think, right?
[136:57.01]Lead Demon's Soul.

[137:03.79]Which one is it?
[137:08.27]It's returning.
[137:12.96]Blacksmith Ed and Baldwin.

[137:28.59]Welcome back.
[137:31.23]Hey, meet me.
[137:31.87]I'm the person that levels you up, and I probably have a blindfold on.
[137:34.79]Yep.
[137:36.85]The monumental awaits the above.
[137:51.62]Hmm, the monument waits?
[137:57.25]The monumental will explain the nexus to thee.
[138:00.43]Alright, well, I didn't even look at that.
[138:03.47]Didn't even look.
[138:04.73]Speaking of looking.
[138:07.68]Let me say thank you, first of all, to Frogzone for the three bucks.
[138:10.74]Thanks for the countless hours of entertainment.
[138:12.20]Please allocate these bits towards the clown car joke fund.

[138:22.45]Would appreciate a good luck for my favorite video game streamer.
[138:25.64]Well, good luck, Nick.
[138:27.84]I wish you the best of luck in the Navy.
[138:30.78]Go sail those ships.
[138:34.74]Best of luck to you.
[138:35.88]Take care, man.
[138:37.95]Funky Berlin, thank you for the $15.

[138:45.81]Mod Kyle.
[138:47.95]Thank you, Funky.
[138:49.45]Appreciate it.
[138:52.01]I think that guy Kyle was in one stream and then he was gone forever.
[138:55.32]You guys scared him away.
[138:57.30]He was scared to be here.
[139:00.42]But thank you again, Funky Berlin, for the $15.

[139:23.05]You know, that's true.
[139:24.31]This guy does now have to be in the next Rumble as, you know, Tim Machine.
[139:29.36]We gotta make it very clear that it's Tim Machine, not Time Machine.
[139:33.38]Uh, let me touch your bum, thanks for the $15.
[139:35.30]Happy streaming birthday, Jermbo.
[139:37.94]You're my favorite streamer, and you're a dwarf clown man.
[139:43.76]Okay, thank you.
[139:45.34]Thanks for the $15 insult on my birthday of all times.
[139:50.40]Thanks.
[139:52.62]I think I'm pretty much caught up with the bits.
[139:54.77]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[139:56.99]Thank you, King Roy, as well.
[139:58.01]He says, good job.
[139:59.53]Hashtag charity.
[140:00.23]Thank you.
[140:03.45]Alright, so I'm doing strength, right?
[140:08.40]No, I have to do that first.
[140:10.40]Okay, go up to go above.
[140:13.56]Wait, that monument?
[140:14.32]Oh, the big one.
[140:15.22]I think it's the big one.
[140:17.80]This thing?
[140:18.54]No.
[140:19.42]The big one.
[140:25.69]I'm gonna give you a so far.
[140:27.53]I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys a so far.
[140:31.81]Um... Yeah.
[140:36.81]Yeah.
[140:38.53]Demon's Souls?
[140:39.69]So far, Demon's Souls?
[140:41.29]Yep.
[140:42.59]Mm-hmm.
[140:51.12]Where's this monument?
[140:58.68]I should have fucking- I should have paid attention to the instruction manual.
[141:01.37]I really should have.
[141:01.89]I just didn't.
[141:03.41]There it is.
[141:03.73]Alright, teach me.
[141:16.01]The highest of praises is a- is a, uh, yep.
[141:22.09]This has the look and feel of Dark Souls, but it plays like Bloodborne.
[141:28.32]Touch door to the Pantheon.
[141:30.46]Yes.
[141:34.54]What?
[141:37.22]I think I'm supposed to do this, right?
[141:40.26]Second most phantoms saved.
[141:43.63]What the hell am I talking about?
[141:44.61]Third most phantoms... Is this a leaderboard?
[141:48.67]Most phantoms saved.
[141:50.93]Is this guy.
[141:55.37]This guy's... This guy's... This... This guy's killed.
[141:59.96]Hold on.
[142:00.52]How many zeros?
[142:01.66]How many... One, two, three.
[142:03.82]One, two, three.
[142:04.60]You're telling me this guy has been playing Demon's Souls for ten years and killed 2.4 million people?
[142:14.39]Huh?
[142:19.43]This guy's... This guy's slain two and a half million players.
[142:22.92]Is that what I'm reading here?
[142:29.67]What about number two?
[142:32.85]Hold on, but how does number... Number two has killed two and a half million.
[142:36.17]Number one's two and a half million.
[142:37.71]Number two is... 367 million people died.
[142:39.93]What?
[142:40.03]This guy's even more.
[142:40.87]756 million people?
[142:41.61]With zero trophies.
[142:47.63]Alright, none of these are legit.
[142:48.37]Wow.
[143:00.21]What about the guy at the very bottom?
[143:01.47]This guy might be legit.
[143:04.31]He's got 19 trophies and he's died.
[143:05.91]Hold on.
[143:06.17]No, no way.
[143:06.73]1, 2, 3.
[143:07.11]1, 2, 3.
[143:07.29]1, 2, 3.
[143:07.35]This guy.
[143:08.22]Oh, yeah.
[143:09.04]You know, he's killed one and a half billion phantoms.
[143:20.28]Yeah.
[143:21.31]He's been playing the game for a while.
[143:22.95]No, this guy has his PlayStation Now account hooked up to like 75 PlayStations and they all have their buttons mapped
[143:30.73]And he's multi-boxing.
[143:32.70]And he killed 1.5 billion people.
[143:36.96]81.
[143:37.06]Okay, sure.
[143:37.92]Sure thing.
[143:39.76]Most souls obtained.
[143:40.74]Not yet.
[143:43.34]I believe it.
[143:47.11]Just rename this like the Hall of Hackers.
[143:52.65]That's what this place should be called.
[143:54.74]Stone of Ephemeral Eyes.
[143:56.88]Oh, yeah, cool.
[143:59.50]9999999.
[143:59.62]I was just backed off.
[144:00.72]Good thing you can't fall off this.
[144:11.61]1.5 billion.
[144:14.39]Billion.
[144:15.95]You know, I tell you, I was worth 1.5 billion.
[144:18.29]Billion.
[144:20.71]Okay, well that was nice.
[144:21.77]That was cool.
[144:22.77]Now what?
[144:23.75]Uniter of the world.
[144:27.53]We're not gonna look at these anymore.
[144:35.70]Yeah, that guy?
[144:36.32]That guy that killed 1.5 billion people?
[144:40.22]That guy, by himself, that guy has killed like 10% of the entire human population.
[144:45.63]I mean, that's kind of ridiculous.
[144:53.09]I don't think I went the right way.
[144:55.75]I gotta go find the monument.
[144:59.95]Is this the right way?
[145:03.19]Look, once I see it once, I don't ever have to see it again.
[145:05.01]It's like riding a bike.
[145:05.87]Once you learn how to ride the bike, you don't have to learn to ride the bike again.
[145:08.27]I just don't know which way it is.
[145:09.17]I would assume it's, like, right here.
[145:13.90]Like, why is it not right here?
[145:14.94]It is right here.
[145:19.82]No, it's not.
[145:21.88]Where the hell am I going?
[145:24.52]I need to go talk to the monument.
[145:26.86]Is this talking to the monument?
[145:33.94]It's kind of cool just to walk around and see this though.
[145:43.83]Find the lit candle.
[145:46.43]Huh?
[145:48.07]The lit candle?
[145:51.91]I've ran by it.
[146:00.87]Well, there's another item over here.
[146:03.23]Stone... What the hell does that do?
[146:13.42]Go upstairs and converse with the monument.
[146:15.82]Are you fucking kidding me?
[146:24.03]I am one of the monumentals.
[146:25.59]Hold on, wait, this is the thing?
[146:27.25]We preserve the fabric of reality.
[146:29.59]What?
[146:30.33]That's so conspicuous.
[146:32.81]That's so inconspicuous.
[146:33.93]Now, we too, a scourge of demons faced.
[146:38.94]Wow.
[146:40.42]I, okay.
[146:41.50]In the distant past, under a benevolent rule, the world was united, owing to the soul arts.
[146:49.92]It's like a kid sitting on the ground matching everything.
[146:53.58]What the hell?
[146:54.18]I never found that without help.
[146:56.16]I was about to be like, what the hell am I supposed to go?
[147:10.25]Thanks be, we were able to love the old one back to its mother.
[147:16.36]Yet only after the loss of innumerable souls and half the world, lost, erased by the fog.
[147:27.63]In order to mend the fabric of what land still remained, we entrusted six elders with six precious archstones.
[147:37.92]This storyline sure is familiar.
[147:42.42]Embers.
[147:43.64]Restore the embers from the six princes.
[147:46.28]One to the wise queen of the great ivory tower.
[147:58.13]To the bird.
[147:58.87]Dark Souls 1 is better because there isn't a fast travel for most of the game.
[148:07.10]That's actually the reason why I don't like Dark Souls 1.
[148:18.23]I gotta go.
[148:18.83]I gotta move.
[148:20.81]I gotta go.
[148:21.37]I gotta go.
[148:21.85]Travel.
[148:22.31]Go.
[148:22.61]Quick.
[148:22.99]Now.
[148:23.35]Button.
[148:23.69]Press.
[148:26.57]ADD.
[148:27.37]Go.
[148:29.81]Finally, we became monumentals.
[148:33.49]Half-living sentinels of the fabric of reality.
[148:35.61]I'm not gonna skip it.
[148:36.09]Why would I skip this?
[148:38.91]This is an important storyline.
[148:39.99]You see, there's like a seed there with an egg and it's a tree grow out of it.
[148:42.71]And only I remain.
[148:46.79]And they're using, like, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre filter on all the footage so, like, you know that it's, like, old and shit's, like, all fucked up.
[148:55.36]By the power of the monumentals, the four sealed archstones have been released.
[148:59.16]Now it is your turn.
[149:01.46]You must lull the old one back to its slumber and seal it away for all eternity.
[149:08.68]If not, the deep fog will absorb all that we know.
[149:14.27]Have you the strength to accept this mission?
[149:17.79]I don't know.
[149:19.85]Oh shit, I actually can't say yes or no.
[149:24.03]Is this important?
[149:27.79]By the way, I just realized, I thought these were all statues.
[149:31.44]No, they're all just dead people.
[149:35.48]It's crazy, interesting stuff.
[149:37.92]Don't say no.
[149:41.82]Really?
[149:42.06]Really?
[149:47.61]No?
[149:47.87]Does this matter?
[149:48.85]We'll do a straw poll.
[149:52.36]I don't know if this matters.
[149:53.06]This ain't going to get me killed or something, is it?
[149:58.16]I mean, I think I know what people are going to vote for, but let's just do it anyways.
[150:09.84]Can you see that?
[150:22.18]Oh, shit.
[150:23.24]I thought, well, everyone's saying no, now most people are saying yes.
[150:27.18]Doesn't matter?
[150:27.70]Well, how come everyone's telling me to do a poll?
[150:30.92]No, it's a huge deal.
[150:31.78]Am I getting, like, just baited again?
[150:33.19]I'm, like, the fucking king of getting baited by this chat.
[150:35.37]I really am.
[150:36.23]I believe everything you guys say.
[150:41.57]Like, literally, I look over at the chat, and I, if somebody, even if one guy said something...
[150:56.33]The question is, accept the mission.
[150:58.01]Ignore the poll.
[150:58.89]I can't.
[150:59.53]This is a democracy.
[151:00.47]Yeah, it's over.
[151:03.66]It's yes by a long shot.
[151:07.36]There's no way you're coming back from this one.
[151:11.64]Yes is winning by 64%.
[151:13.88]Poll's over.
[151:14.36]It's done.
[151:15.52]We're accepting the mission.
[151:16.95]We are fortunate indeed to have you.
[151:20.40]now go forth and destroy every last demon the old one without demons to feed its souls will a new servant seek and lure you just walk away can I come back and give an answer later
[151:39.48]We neutralized the Old One and banned the Saw Arts.
[151:44.43]Then, we spread the Archstones.
[151:47.23]And in order to mend reality, Monumentals we became.
[151:51.03]However, man's memory of history is unsure.
[151:54.76]And before long, you repeated his mistake.
[151:56.82]The Monumentals perished, and the Archstones were long forgotten.
[152:07.75]And the short-sighted King Alant once again aroused the old one.
[152:12.90]That guy looks so uninterested in this shit.
[152:15.92]Oh, really?
[152:16.34]That's interesting.
[152:18.00]Thanks.
[152:18.28]The monumentals perished, and the archstones were long forgotten.
[152:23.48]And the short-sighted King Alant once again aroused the old one.
[152:29.88]Wait, he aroused?
[152:30.52]Wait, somebody got aroused?
[152:31.37]What happened?
[152:32.67]The monumentals perished, and the short- Okay, let's go.
[152:35.65]Thank you.
[152:38.82]Very interesting.
[152:39.92]Very int- Ooh!
[152:41.44]Secret!
[152:42.46]Right?
[152:44.82]Why would this be broken if there wasn't a secret?
[152:46.18]No, I have full health.
[152:47.68]I'm not fucking around with that.
[152:48.85]No way.
[152:49.15]Let's go.
[152:49.97]Back downstairs.
[152:54.37]I'm not jumping.
[152:56.45]The penalty for dying in Demon's Souls is horrible.
[153:00.57]I'm not going to be part of that right now.
[153:03.50]Not a chance.
[153:06.39]Okay, what?
[153:07.85]Okay, hold on.
[153:08.53]What is that?
[153:10.41]No, no, no.
[153:11.86]Don't do it.
[153:12.88]Just go, please.
[153:13.70]Don't make yourself regret everything.
[153:19.68]Level up.
[153:20.18]Yeah, I'm gonna go down to the level up person, right?
[153:23.54]You can die in the Nexus.
[153:25.08]It doesn't kill you?
[153:27.83]Well, frankly, I don't think I believe you.
[153:29.19]I'm sorry.
[153:32.47]The Nexus is safe to die.
[153:36.14]What was that?
[153:37.68]Oh.
[153:39.34]I'm surprised people are actually still playing this game.
[153:42.68]Why would I be surprised about that?
[153:44.83]It's like... Well, no, I am surprised!
[153:49.45]Blue Eyestone, White Eye, that's probably... Okay, Eyestone is temporarily connected to the Diffuse World.
[153:53.29]Should you lose your physical form, remember to Eyestone.
[153:55.27]Okay, well, whatever.
[153:57.37]The Maiden controls inhuman souls.
[153:58.82]This power allows her to aid those who slay demons.
[154:01.69]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[154:02.98]Seek soul power.
[154:03.88]Touch the Demon's Souls.
[154:09.91]Seek Soul Power.
[154:11.65]Okay.
[154:12.85]So I need... What do I got here?
[154:18.05]But what I was gonna say is, I'm surprised that... What the hell are they thinking?
[154:26.34]Why wouldn't they have put this game at like 60 FPS and re-released it on PS4?
[154:30.90]The Dark Souls games and Bloodborne is so popular, why is this only available on PlayStation 3?
[154:37.14]This isn't on PlayStation Now either.
[154:40.42]Like, why the fuck would they not do, like, a re-release of this game on PS4?
[154:43.76]So many people would want to play this.
[154:45.78]I don't get it.
[154:46.16]Okay, so... Attack power would win strength.
[154:52.22]Let's get to... Licensing.
[154:54.76]But it's a Sony game, isn't it?
[154:57.79]Why wouldn't they just put it on PS4?
[154:59.71]Somehow.
[155:00.71]The game is a mess?
[155:01.71]Okay.
[155:06.45]Oh boy, you have to actually do point by point, huh?
[155:11.97]Let's just get this to how many souls required.
[155:15.01]Let's get this to what, like... Okay, let's get it to 18.
[155:21.03]I can crush a thing.
[155:23.44]Let me... Let me crush one of those things and put one into vitality or endurance.
[155:29.00]What do you think?
[155:32.66]Oh.
[155:33.30]It's a boss soul.
[155:37.70]Use item.
[155:41.57]Can I use multiple?
[155:42.49]Did I just use them all?
[155:48.61]I did.
[155:49.21]Okay.
[155:51.22]Let me... Hold on a second.
[155:52.44]What do you think?
[155:54.24]Endurance?
[155:54.54]Endurance or Vitality?
[155:55.72]I'm going to say... I have 15.
[155:58.06]Let's do Endurance.
[156:09.15]Dark Souls 2 is the best game anyways.
[156:14.91]Whoa, excuse me.
[156:19.50]Deposit item.
[156:20.20]Let's just put in... I'm almost halfway here.
[156:27.24]Put the mail breaker away.
[156:31.77]Deposit.
[156:32.17]I have two clubs.
[156:34.64]Wait, what?
[156:35.78]Why is this club different than this club?
[156:38.10]No, it's just durability.
[156:40.82]Shit, come on.
[156:46.15]God knows I'm not smart in real life.
[156:47.99]What the fuck are you talking about?
[156:50.53]You're gonna insult me as a sub in sub-only mode?
[156:53.25]What is this?
[156:54.99]Isn't that what I'm supposed to be avoiding?
[156:58.18]Oh god, that's too many of these.
[157:03.20]Can I sell this shit to somebody?
[157:04.56]I feel like I don't need half of it.
[157:15.45]I can't even wear this stuff anyways.
[157:16.67]Like, is there somebody I can sell to?
[157:26.68]No, there's no selling in this game?
[157:34.42]Okay.
[157:36.62]No selling.
[157:38.33]So should I just be destroying items?
[157:42.93]Okay, well.
[157:45.43]Confused.
[157:47.03]There is selling.
[157:50.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[157:53.89]Alright.
[157:54.51]What do you got for me?
[157:55.25]Upgrade weapon.
[157:56.09]I could do... What?
[158:00.61]I can't upgrade?
[158:02.63]My...
[158:04.51]Turkey leg?
[158:04.95]I mean, part of me, like, really should be using this, but I don't... It's just too slow and too big.
[158:21.02]E, D, D. What do you got in here?
[158:28.23]Dagger, battle axe.
[158:29.23]I don't have enough.
[158:33.36]Hmm, whatever.
[158:35.78]What about you?
[158:39.82]You got anything for me?
[158:41.00]Fuck this round of Armada.
[158:42.58]I beat that first strike.
[158:44.04]Okay.
[158:44.22]Anything else you got to say, buddy?
[158:57.17]Yep.
[158:57.41]Anything else?
[158:57.93]Come on.
[158:58.21]I know how these games work.
[158:59.43]One more time?
[159:25.13]Of course not.
[159:27.03]Okay, well, let's go.
[159:27.89]Let's just take a stroll.
[159:33.44]That's cool.
[159:34.10]Was that doing that before?
[159:34.84]What about this?
[159:40.28]Um, I'm just gonna go.
[159:42.00]I want to, like, upgrade the turkey, but... I have such a... I have such a terrible, terrible, terrible time in these games whenever I pick something.
[159:57.82]Let's just go here.
[160:01.93]I want to, like, get a weapon and upgrade something.
[160:04.71]I always hoard my shards.
[160:06.49]It's bad.
[160:12.25]Jerma doesn't pay attention to anything we're talking about.
[160:15.75]How am I not paying attention to anything we're talking about?
[160:26.32]Everything below this juke.
[160:27.52]What?
[160:31.29]Jupiter.
[160:31.73]More of these things.
[160:38.50]Don't do this level.
[160:40.66]Isn't this like the level after where I... Wait, I'm not supposed to be here?
[160:50.15]Why not?
[161:06.00]You can go anywhere.
[161:07.44]The game is not linear.
[161:08.88]Really.
[161:11.12]That's kind of cool.
[161:14.32]The stones represent a different area.
[161:16.56]Oh, fuck.
[161:17.16]That's so... Alright, that's awesome.
[161:18.66]I didn't know that.
[161:20.88]So when it said, like, oh, we're unlocking the four areas, they meant, like, quite literally the areas are all being unlocked and you can go anywhere.
[161:29.46]That's a change for me.
[161:31.60]Open world.
[161:33.08]Alright, let me go take a look at the... I'm curious.
[161:36.18]That's... Okay, cool.
[161:40.12]Let's go check it out.
[161:43.22]They're literally all open.
[161:44.42]Damn.
[161:46.80]Well.
[161:50.36]Is there a place where I shouldn't be going?
[161:54.70]Or is it all kind of at this point similar?
[161:57.46]Is there like a stone if I go to I'm just gonna insta-die by every enemy?
[162:09.28]Alright, so there's here.
[162:11.53]Oh, wow.
[162:12.25]Okay.
[162:13.63]Stonefang Tunnel.
[162:17.67]Tower of Latria.
[162:20.29]Queen's Ivory Tower.
[162:23.29]That's broken.
[162:26.07]Each level one area should be beatable.
[162:28.07]That's awesome!
[162:31.55]Island, Shrine of Storms.
[162:34.17]Okay, which one do I think is the coolest?
[162:37.57]Valley of Defilement.
[162:39.13]Nope.
[162:40.29]Poison and Plague.
[162:41.67]I ain't gonna do that one until I'm fucking... Let's go to the Storm of Swords.
[162:46.62]Yeah.
[162:46.82]Let's go here.
[162:49.40]I ain't doing a Poison Swamp right now.
[162:51.96]No way.
[162:56.82]Just got here.
[162:57.30]How am I enjoying the game so far?
[162:58.60]It's great.
[163:03.52]That's arguably the hardest one.
[163:05.44]Okay.
[163:05.58]Well, good.
[163:06.00]Good.
[163:10.15]Yeah, I'm enjoying it.
[163:11.31]I mean, I'm only like two or three hours in.
[163:14.57]I beat the first boss.
[163:16.16]It's good.
[163:16.46]It's cool.
[163:16.88]I like it.
[163:21.42]Everything... I don't... What is their fetish for poison swamps?
[163:27.02]They did it one time.
[163:30.18]Then they did it again, and then they did it again, and then they did it again, and they did it again.
[163:35.05]Why do they keep doing it again?
[163:38.03]They don't have to do it again.
[163:39.45]Okay.
[163:39.99]Alright.
[163:40.39]Okay.
[163:40.83]Okay.
[163:41.29]Alright.
[163:41.53]Calm down, buddy.
[163:45.15]That was way too quick.
[163:47.64]That guy just did like a roll.
[163:49.68]Okay.
[163:50.10]You are moving.
[163:51.92]That's for sure.
[163:52.54]Maybe if you didn't do so many... He did fuck me up, though.
[163:58.00]Alright.
[164:03.63]I'm...
[164:06.24]How do I do it?
[164:07.54]How do I do it?
[164:09.70]How do I rate this?
[164:12.56]Tell me.
[164:15.04]How do I rate this?
[164:21.99]I want to rate this message.
[164:22.89]I don't know how to rate messages.

[165:09.38]Why did I just do that?
[165:14.88]I do like this area, though.
[165:16.78]It's interesting.
[165:20.58]Enemies are a little crazy.
[165:21.70]I like it when enemies are a little crazy, you know?
[165:25.50]How much is his heal?
[165:27.30]Not a lot.
[165:28.80]Hello!
[165:29.22]Somebody behind me.
[165:30.67]No?
[165:37.52]Up, up, down, down, select, select, select, select.
[165:40.74]You guys remember the chicken selects?
[165:44.65]From McDonald's.
[165:45.45]What happened to those?
[165:47.67]They had chicken nuggets, and then they had chicken selects.
[165:52.21]And they were like, just long, more breaded versions of the chicken nuggets.
[165:56.93]They were like chicken tenders.
[165:57.93]What happened to them?
[165:58.47]They were good.
[166:02.13]What's the problem?
[166:02.77]Why did they delete them?
[166:04.87]Are they coming back?
[166:07.13]Ow, that hurt.
[166:15.70]Press select, it makes you rate them.
[166:18.30]Hold on a second.
[166:19.02]Hold on a second!
[166:19.90]Wait a minute.
[166:20.52]Wait just a minute.
[166:21.26]Wait just a minute!
[166:22.06]Don't come that fast at me, please!
[166:25.10]Wait a minute!
[166:26.12]They're too fast!
[166:27.61]Take it!
[166:27.95]Come on, eat the grass!
[166:29.61]Aye yai yai, my fucking lanthess!
[166:35.50]They're too fast!
[166:37.48]Oh my god, they're fucking- this spinny move!
[166:39.30]I don't like the spinny guys!
[166:40.92]I don't like the spinny guys and I'm gonna die to the spinny guys!
[166:44.54]Jesus Christ!
[166:48.77]What the fuck?
[166:51.33]They don't give you a second!
[166:56.72]Do these guys have a fucking stamina bar?
[167:01.04]And now I have... Oh my lord.
[167:02.98]What the fuck?
[167:05.18]They just roll forever.
[167:06.72]Until you stop.
[167:08.74]And then they swing.
[167:10.00]Twice.
[167:11.02]What the fuck is that dog shit?
[167:15.62]Give me a break.
[167:21.66]Stupid, like, remember the wheel?
[167:24.09]The stupid, obnoxious fucking wheel enemies in Dark Souls?
[167:27.75]Oh my fucking god, I'm dead again.
[167:29.41]Please just hit him.
[167:37.91]I was gonna hit him twice.
[167:45.46]Fuck these enemies, holy shit.
[167:49.21]Alright, so I know how to deal with these enemies.
[167:51.33]It's called, you have to kill them immediately.
[167:54.07]Otherwise, you'll lose.
[167:55.63]I'm glad to see the lock-on issue started in Demon's Souls.
[168:02.26]Where if they were just barely out of range and you lock on, your character spins around in a circle the other direction.
[168:09.13]That's an A+.
[168:09.47]Fucking A+.
[168:09.75]Here it comes.
[168:10.05]Don't run.
[168:16.83]That's how you do it.
[168:17.39]You have to fucking kill them immediately.
[168:18.91]God damn it.
[168:30.50]So that's why people are saying, please help me.
[168:34.18]Getting a lot of souls for this, though.
[168:36.56]It's a good thing.
[168:38.62]Already a fog gate.
[168:40.92]Right off the bat.
[168:42.36]Oh, watch out for that.
[168:45.55]That hurts.
[168:48.27]What are those fucking flying stingrays?
[168:49.95]Is that a boss?
[168:52.45]What the hell was that?
[168:53.75]Okay.
[168:55.59]Are there more than one?
[168:59.43]That thing was kind of intimidating.
[169:01.03]Oh, well.
[169:09.06]Soldiers Lotus, what's it say?
[169:10.24]Beware of a trap ahead.
[169:13.86]Okay, I promise I will.
[169:18.39]Oh no.
[169:24.69]Oh, those guys up top.
[169:25.79]I've got to make this a living hell.
[169:29.67]This is going to be living fucking hell with people shooting all these ice bolts at me.
[169:36.74]Versus the Taurus, Steven.
[169:43.80]Yeah, he's back.
[169:46.78]I need to get up.
[169:47.40]And the stingray's up there, too.
[169:50.22]Killigi.
[169:51.14]Killidge.
[169:52.58]Kill him.
[169:54.38]I hear twinkling.
[169:55.44]Was that in this game?
[169:56.29]Did they introduce that shit in this game?
[169:57.57]Like the twinkling bugs?
[170:01.11]I hear one.
[170:01.59]Where is it?
[170:05.43]There it is, down there.
[170:06.07]I can't.
[170:08.87]I can't.
[170:09.39]I can't.
[170:10.03]I can't.
[170:10.47]I'm not gonna... I can't.
[170:12.78]Can't do it.
[170:15.66]What the fuck was that?
[170:16.86]What just dropped on me?
[170:18.64]What is... What is this?
[170:20.54]What?
[170:24.08]Oh god, this place sucks.
[170:26.20]Does he have a health bar?
[170:28.01]Is he like a boss?
[170:28.89]He was a boss before.
[170:31.15]Why is he just standing here?
[170:32.17]Oh god damn it, man.
[170:37.61]This is the worst.
[170:39.17]They just... Should I shoot that thing with a crossbow?
[170:45.58]I'm so scared.
[170:46.52]Just heal up to full health and then run at him.
[170:48.16]What's the worst that could happen?
[170:48.96]I lose?
[170:49.56]Oh, no.
[170:49.90]I'm gonna lose anyways.
[170:57.11]Okay, well, this guy don't die.
[171:04.75]Okay, well, I'm dead.
[171:07.32]Alright, that's fun.
[171:15.40]Okay.
[171:17.64]Thanks for playing.
[171:22.10]Looks like we're just going to have to run by him.
[171:26.42]Should have ran, but I didn't know.
[171:28.02]How am I supposed to know that?
[171:28.86]I got to deal with these idiots again.
[171:40.42]It's alright.
[171:41.18]I got to run by them.
[171:43.49]Sprint on by.
[171:50.84]Oh, don't give me this shit.
[171:53.70]I love how I'm fighting, like, another player.
[171:58.78]I don't want to lose all that shit, though.
[172:06.66]Don't.
[172:08.95]Fine.
[172:09.13]You want to be like, you want to do a PvP fight?
[172:10.67]I'll just R1 spam you.
[172:12.77]Then it'll be fair.
[172:16.99]Come with this other... Can I just get one?
[172:21.97]Come on, die quick!
[172:25.65]Don't kill me.
[172:26.73]I've come this far to just not to die by your fucking dumb hand.
[172:32.09]Don't, don't!
[172:32.66]Did you see what I just said?
[172:34.12]I came this far and I was gonna do the wheel.
[172:38.36]Jesus, just fucking kill him!
[172:40.00]I hate these guys.
[172:49.54]God.
[172:50.52]Alright, well here we are.
[172:54.03]Watch out.
[172:54.55]We just gotta run by.
[172:55.49]Watch out for the stingrays.
[172:56.43]I gotta get my stuff.
[172:58.35]Where did I look?
[173:00.05]The game is having a lot of trouble loading this area right now because of the dust.
[173:03.01]And look at where my souls are.
[173:05.77]What is this fucking sound?
[173:07.77]Stop it.
[173:08.43]Stop giving me like eight frames a second.
[173:19.18]What's over here?
[173:20.12]Trap.
[173:20.42]That's a trap.
[173:21.00]I knew it.
[173:24.53]Fucking knew it.
[173:29.72]What is over here?
[173:32.00]Ah.
[173:32.50]I'm lost again.
[173:33.34]I have to go.
[173:33.76]I'm going around the back.
[173:35.64]Oh, shit.
[173:37.50]Not prepared for this.
[173:38.58]I need to get my souls.
[173:39.84]Hold on.
[173:40.58]Parry him.
[173:41.36]I can do it.
[173:41.88]Instant win.
[173:45.62]I can get... Hello?
[173:48.10]What the fuck?
[173:52.98]Get him.
[173:55.57]I'm fucking dead in one hit.
[173:58.07]Jesus fucking Christ.
[174:06.65]Why?
[174:07.76]Why are there like just bosses everywhere?
[174:10.68]What the fuck?
[174:13.88]This whole zone is a boss.
[174:16.74]It's all just fucking bosses.
[174:18.44]It's like run by everybody.
[174:19.78]Where's the... What?
[174:27.02]You got like three stingrays like raining hell.
[174:30.54]A bunch of guys shooting fucking arrows at me.
[174:34.56]What the fuck is this place?
[174:41.43]Oh my fucking god.
[174:42.89]Ugh, stop.
[174:49.91]Oh my fucking god, this place sucks.
[174:52.29]This place fucking sucks.
[174:55.69]This place is the worst.
[175:02.29]Remember in Dark Souls 1 when you accidentally go to the graveyard?
[175:05.31]This is like that.
[175:11.89]No, I want to get at least past that big fat guy.
[175:16.46]First of all, I gotta get off tilt for a second.
[175:18.96]Give me one second.
[175:26.51]Let me get off tilt, just for a minute.
[175:28.27]Just stop complaining about the worst enemies so far.
[175:32.20]Don't complain about the infinite stamina enemies.
[175:34.30]Just stop complaining about it.
[175:35.76]The shittiest enemy in any Dark Souls game that has infinite fucking stamina.
[175:39.56]Don't complain about these guys!
[175:44.53]They turn into a wheel and they can swing.
[175:46.13]And they can do it immediately after.
[175:47.61]And here he comes again, and I tried to... Just please die.
[175:57.44]Turkey leg is no match for this shit.
[175:59.02]It really isn't.
[176:04.25]Oh, lord in fucking heaven.
[176:11.71]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[176:14.15]No!
[176:15.17]No.
[176:16.13]No.
[176:17.27]No, come on.
[176:18.23]No.
[176:19.31]Take it!
[176:20.39]Drink it!
[176:21.15]Eat it!
[176:21.45]Whatever the thing is.
[176:22.32]Eat the fucking spearmint.
[176:25.32]Don't follow him down.
[176:28.69]Oh my lord.
[176:36.54]Here comes like the skipping CD again.
[176:38.14]Alright, here's my attempt here.
[176:44.78]I'm gonna try to get by him.
[176:47.87]Don't ask me how the hell I'm gonna do that.
[176:50.59]Twist it!
[176:51.21]Pull it!
[176:51.89]Yank it!
[176:52.71]Bop it!
[176:58.93]Did you get the CD in the right way?
[177:02.00]Oh my god.
[177:06.92]Don't drop down there.
[177:07.68]Maybe I should.
[177:08.18]I don't know.
[177:08.70]Fog gate?
[177:09.38]Okay.
[177:13.08]Okay, we made it.
[177:21.33]What the fuck is happening right now?
[177:22.43]What?
[177:23.35]Why?
[177:24.01]Hey, stop it!
[177:27.84]Dude, the reason why this area sucks so bad is because of the fucking CD skipping.
[177:31.65]What is this, like 1994?
[177:36.73]You put too many enemies here for the PlayStation 3 to handle this.
[177:41.64]Wow.
[177:43.46]Oh, wow.
[177:44.96]Wow, dude.
[177:45.58]Wait a second.
[177:48.14]I don't understand.
[177:48.86]Alright, hold on a second.
[177:51.87]Give me one second.
[177:53.19]I gotta back it up.
[177:56.02]Somebody's outside my window right now.
[177:57.78]Somebody's knocking on my fucking window.
[178:01.36]Somebody... Kim locked herself out of the house.
[178:03.22]Hold on.
[178:05.24]That just scared the shit out of me.
[178:06.48]I just got a katana.
[178:08.52]Can I hide somewhere?
[178:13.10]What's down here?
[178:13.60]What is this?
[178:14.30]Hold on.
[178:14.86]Wait.
[178:15.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:16.73]Why can they still throw spears through here?
[178:18.61]Am I safe?
[178:20.09]I think I'm safe.
[178:20.57]Alright, I'm good.
[178:21.63]Kim's outside the fucking window.
[178:22.97]Give me a minute.
[179:08.17]That was fucking scary.
[179:13.74]Like, I got a knock on the window next to me.
[179:17.74]That was just like, who the fuck is coming to murder me right now?
[179:26.40]Oh, oh, oh!
[179:27.38]What have I done?
[179:28.48]What happened?
[179:28.88]I didn't even... This is supposed to be an illusory wall.
[179:30.58]Hold on.
[179:30.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[179:31.92]No!
[179:42.52]What is down here?
[179:43.92]What are all these noises?
[179:48.87]Moon grass.
[179:50.09]That's fine.
[179:51.47]What else is here?
[179:54.27]I hear a twinkling.
[179:57.55]Oh, God.
[179:58.43]There's a guy down here.
[180:04.04]Can I open this?
[180:07.16]Hello?
[180:10.02]It appears to be locked.
[180:14.16]And I can't talk to him.
[180:15.96]Okay.
[180:19.24]Big bug.
[180:23.40]I hate this.
[180:24.52]The window is open for like a second.
[180:26.41]Oh, God.
[180:26.81]There's a giant fucking bug in here.
[180:32.19]Get away from me.
[180:34.05]It's a huge mosquito.
[180:35.11]You know the mosquitoes I'm talking about?
[180:36.09]The ones that are like too big.
[180:38.03]And they look like they're just...
[180:53.86]Fucking damn it.
[181:04.86]Crane flies.
[181:05.48]Whatever they are.
[181:07.04]Just flew in my face like three times.
[181:08.84]I ain't going here.
[181:14.79]This place is fucking insane.
[181:19.34]We're gonna go somewhere else.
[181:20.38]What do you want?
[181:21.23]I'm not fucking touching you, you weird, like, sex shit.
[181:26.91]Get out of here.
[181:29.75]What is this?
[181:32.47]Let's go here.
[181:33.92]Ivory Tower.
[181:41.64]They don't bite?
[181:43.14]Did I say it bit me?
[181:44.08]No, I said it flew in my face.
[181:46.27]It was trying to land in my eyeball.
[181:49.90]I blew it away, and then it got angry that I didn't want it to land inside of my eye socket, so it came back and tried to attach to my face.
[181:58.07]Look, I don't care if it's a bug.
[181:59.13]I don't care if it's a person.
[182:00.97]I don't want you in my personal space.
[182:03.35]Unannounced.
[182:12.78]Don't... Wait.
[182:13.14]Don't go here?
[182:13.42]What do you mean, don't go here?
[182:18.55]Turn around.
[182:19.37]Why?
[182:19.89]You don't want me to go here?
[182:20.89]Why?
[182:22.99]Wait, I thought you guys told me that I could do any of these areas.
[182:25.49]There was no, it wasn't like linear.
[182:28.05]You guys told me this was an NLE.
[182:29.97]A non-linear editing system.
[182:33.88]That's what I was told.
[182:35.86]He's still attacking me.
[182:37.50]I'm going to crush this thing in a book.
[182:39.06]I swear to God.
[182:42.94]I'm going to pick up a magazine and I'm going to crush this bug.
[182:55.60]Now I hear bells.
[182:56.64]Is there a person in here with me?
[183:00.14]This place is freaking me out.
[183:06.24]Kill it on camera?
[183:07.32]I can't.
[183:07.70]This is locked.
[183:12.57]Kind of getting research facility flashes from Bloodborne here.
[183:18.13]Can't say I'm particularly excited about this awful frame rate though.
[183:27.00]I don't know.
[183:27.36]Yeah, kill these before they come out and get me.
[183:35.08]Oh, it's locked.
[183:36.69]Another guy in there?
[183:40.21]Hey!
[183:45.57]Eat the bug.
[183:46.29]You know, uh, Burger Boy one time ate a giant moth when we were on vacation one time.
[183:57.65]Okay.
[183:59.59]The thing was like, the thing was probably like three inches long.
[184:02.46]And he ate the whole thing.
[184:03.18]It was disgusting.
[184:06.40]What is with this right now?
[184:08.10]Do I need to like restart my PlayStation 3?
[184:09.66]This is like seriously fucking with my head.
[184:15.84]Like what the fuck is going on?
[184:26.37]Why is this game like... Why is my disc... I don't even have a disc in.
[184:31.24]This is making this very difficult to play this extremely hard video game.
[184:36.70]Okay, we're gonna go somewhere else.
[184:53.86]Should I... I think I'm gonna restart the game.
[185:03.82]Let me like restart the game I'm just I'm simply just gonna it's all saved right I'm just gonna press the button and then turn the button back on Yeah, this is kind of getting the word I'm looking for is obnoxious The frame rate isn't great, but it's not this bad.
[185:19.59]It's a problem with something else.
[185:20.55]Yeah, I don't know Maybe I like ran into an issue Where it just wouldn't stop Let's just try restarting it They should make this for the PC I agree I
[185:34.51]I agree.
[185:43.36]Because that was kind of just ridiculous.
[185:44.74]It was every, like, half second.
[185:45.98]It was like... And I couldn't even, like... Couldn't move around.
[185:50.98]That was not cool.
[185:55.20]Hopefully we avoid that issue again.
[185:57.77]Go to a zone that I can... No, I don't... Why is Naughty Bear Gold Edition...
[186:03.76]No, I'm not playing Naughty Bear.
[186:05.85]Ow.
[186:06.19]What?
[186:07.77]That's probably what... That was trying to read information from Naughty Bear.
[186:14.95]Like, I think it was actually trying to pull info from the Naughty Bear CD that was inside.
[186:21.96]Whatever.
[186:29.92]This streamer streamed Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[186:32.68]I didn't.
[186:39.92]Alright, so give it to me real.
[186:41.84]Which one of these four areas should I actually be going to?
[186:45.96]I know that the other ones are possible, but what is the actual next place that I should be going?
[186:55.32]Because it seems like those two that I went to were a little on the extreme side.
[187:04.19]The naughty bear zone.
[187:11.53]castle of the mine okay stone fang I'll give it a try stone fang tunnel okay most people unironically do the spinning skeleton area second the boss is a joke okay a more entertaining game wait what
[187:41.31]This game is fucking great.
[187:50.84]According to somebody in the chat, my frame rate issue has to meet with me being online.
[187:55.46]Huh.
[187:57.44]Well, if I continue to run into that problem, I will go offline.
[188:11.00]Come on.
[188:11.46]Let's go.
[188:15.09]Come on.
[188:20.35]So we're probably only going to go for like another half an hour, 40 minutes or so.
[188:25.32]My headache that I had from earlier seems to be creeping back into my brain.
[188:32.58]So let's go to Stonefang.
[188:37.49]Let's give this place a try.
[188:43.15]It's creeping back.
[188:45.61]Honestly, I'm just glad I was able to go for more than three hours without an issue with my head.
[188:54.17]You've had that headache for a week, I know.
[188:56.47]It's not cool.
[188:57.17]It's been actually pretty annoying and strange.
[189:02.67]I wish I knew why it was happening.
[189:09.19]Stay hydrated.
[189:10.05]I am.
[189:11.95]I'm drinking, uh, plenty of water.
[189:15.47]Okay.
[189:16.78]Let's... This place is cool looking.
[189:21.64]Kinda wish I was here with full health.
[189:27.18]The next enemy is a dick.
[189:29.20]Here's the ring lady.
[189:31.13]Now that... I don't know if that's a lady at all.
[189:37.93]I treat fine goods for souls okay what do you got grindstone HP or a pickaxe
[190:00.78]It's a nice wee place.
[190:02.34]All those lizard-eyed townsfolk are busy tinkering with stone.
[190:07.62]I missed a cookie bug, did I?
[190:08.48]And don't bother with old men like myself.
[190:12.36]Makes life rather easy for me.
[190:15.38]I can get away with anything.
[190:16.24]I'm going to have to go back and get him.
[190:19.61]What is he dropping over there?
[190:20.93]Thank you.
[190:23.07]Where are you running off?
[190:25.49]Is he just throwing boulders down here?
[190:31.31]The fucking bug's on me again!
[190:32.40]Oh!
[190:33.80]Oh, and it's made my headache so much worse.
[190:38.02]Oh, god damn it.
[190:40.98]He just, like, landed in my ear.
[190:43.25]Oh!
[190:47.45]God damn it.
[190:51.01]Where am I?
[190:51.47]I... What am I doing here?
[191:00.24]That is... My headache just went from like a 7 to like a 9.
[191:02.34]Give me a fucking break.
[191:04.32]Fuck bugs.
[191:07.78]Why the fuck do bugs exist?
[191:08.94]You know what I mean?
[191:13.20]Why do bugs even exist?
[191:14.68]They don't do anything.
[191:16.84]They're just fucking annoying.
[191:24.49]Like, let's like... Can we like sacrifice...
[191:28.01]all the bugs to just have bees and that's it?
[191:30.47]Can we just have fucking bees?
[191:34.60]Why not?
[191:35.00]What's the big deal?
[191:36.02]Let's just only have bees.
[191:39.02]Like, fuck these crane bugs.
[191:40.26]Like, what's the purpose of a crane bug?
[191:42.58]It does nothing.
[191:43.96]It dies in like 19 hours.
[191:45.64]That's it.
[191:47.65]What a useless fucking species.
[191:49.37]Get out of here.
[191:49.87]Okay.
[191:57.75]Fighting against the fucking Gorons.
[192:05.87]Did you guys not learn anything from the Bee Movie?
[192:16.86]These guys... I'm not killing these guys very well.
[192:18.90]That guy's got a sack.
[192:22.10]These guys don't give any... souls, by the way.
[192:25.64]I'm not sure what the hell I'm doing here.
[192:30.55]I think I just need to walk by you guys.
[192:36.58]Because nobody is really worth killing.
[192:40.18]Alright, now there's fucking dogs.
[192:47.04]Of course, of course, of course, of course.
[192:54.21]Why wouldn't there be something behind there that's actually going to hurt you?
[193:00.87]Fuck me, dude.
[193:01.71]Get out of here.
[193:02.53]Get away from me.
[193:04.25]Oh my god.
[193:13.79]Oh my fucking head.
[193:16.15]God damn it.
[193:16.89]Why?
[193:22.62]Now it's a real dog.
[193:23.64]Headache went from a 9 to a 10.
[193:24.82]Headache actually went to a 10 like 5 minutes ago and I haven't even been talking about it.
[193:33.72]I'm gonna go this way.
[193:39.64]Jesus Christ.
[193:42.42]Yeah, we're at that stage where my headache is actually at the point where it's hard for me to pay attention to anything besides the headache.
[193:50.34]Can I go to the doctor?
[193:51.70]I get these headaches all the fucking time.
[193:53.18]They last like six days.
[193:55.09]I'm gonna go to the doctor and be like, hey, can I suggest something for you?
[193:58.68]Yes, what is it, Jeremy?
[194:00.02]What do you suggest?
[194:00.98]Can you just put a fucking power drill into my ear and hold it down for like three seconds?
[194:06.39]Uh, okay, yeah, sure.
[194:08.25]That's kind of, we don't really do that around here, but... Just do it.
[194:11.77]I'll give you 80 bucks.
[194:12.71]80 bucks, okay!
[194:14.59]Hold on a minute, I'll be right back.
[194:15.61]It's in my truck!
[194:21.89]He'll come back and... He'll do it.
[194:26.36]It's a good plan.
[194:28.16]Now what?
[194:28.58]I'm just walking in fucking circles now.
[194:34.38]Yeah, I get migraines that last, like, fucking five days.
[194:38.68]And it, like, fucks with my head.
[194:39.96]It makes, like, paying attention to things hard.
[194:42.22]It's not fun.
[194:43.14]It's really annoying, actually.
[194:49.51]Doctor drives a truck?
[194:50.91]Why wouldn't... What's wrong with a doctor driving a truck?
[194:55.33]Can I go down this?
[194:57.56]I, like, lost all thought.
[194:59.72]It's back here.
[195:00.24]I have to go that way.
[195:04.96]Take some Advil?
[195:05.70]Yeah, I will.
[195:08.80]I wanted to go long tonight, though.
[195:10.09]I wanted to have a long stream, but that's just not going to happen.
[195:18.39]Excedrin.
[195:21.15]I like Excedrin.
[195:21.78]The only thing, Excedrin has Caffeine.
[195:26.49]And obviously, I don't want to be drinking.
[195:27.73]I mean, I drink coffee late, but taking like a caffeine pill is not something I particularly am like super into doing right now, especially this late.
[195:39.37]Alright, guys.
[195:40.71]Let's just get on this.
[195:43.53]On the roof.
[195:49.31]Almost fell off the roof.
[195:50.41]We're fine, though.
[195:55.29]Whoa.
[195:56.17]Hello.
[195:58.61]Okay, these are like pyromancers.
[196:02.45]Do it again.
[196:03.11]That's good.
[196:03.91]Now... You guys take a lot of hits.
[196:10.70]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[196:11.74]Do it before the Gorons get in here.
[196:13.00]Oh my god, the Gorons!
[196:21.37]Ow!
[196:22.01]I dropped...
[196:27.43]Ah, this is, I'm so annoyed right now.
[196:31.43]There's nothing to do with the game either.
[196:32.71]I'm just, I'm annoyed that I've had a headache for five days.
[196:34.71]Oh well.
[196:47.63]Yeah, I'm gonna attempt this one, but next death I have to go.
[196:50.48]I can't just, I can't stick around anymore.
[196:51.94]It's just getting to the point where it's unbearable.
[196:55.42]Stop streaming, you fool.
[196:56.81]I know, I know.
[196:57.47]But I want to play this game.
[196:59.23]I like this game.
[197:00.07]Let's go back up here one more time.
[197:08.73]Don't you guys understand?
[197:09.52]I have to keep playing.
[197:14.04]I'm fine.
[197:14.40]Don't worry.
[197:14.64]I'm going to be fine.
[197:15.38]Don't worry.
[197:25.07]Why do I feel like I'm not doing any damage to anybody?
[197:31.62]Is that an item?
[197:32.62]Okay, that's a battleaxe.
[197:34.98]That's important to take a look at.
[197:42.73]Is that a plus one battleaxe?
[197:49.09]Crushing battleaxe.
[197:52.53]No, I want to look at the... Let me look at this fucking thing.
[197:59.91]Okay.
[198:03.61]Well.
[198:05.49]Easy.
[198:12.13]Well, this is an awful place to be right now.
[198:17.54]Force dam, force spring.
[198:19.48]It's going pretty good.
[198:29.79]Don't fall off.
[198:30.33]I'm gonna fall off.
[198:31.59]I already know it.
[198:32.80]It's inevitable.
[198:38.68]At least I'm doing more damage now with this guy.
[198:40.66]I can actually hurt him.
[198:45.56]Full moon grass.
[198:46.33]Okay.
[198:48.57]20 bucks for the co-pay?
[198:49.75]Alright, yeah.
[198:52.97]I'm sorry, guys.
[198:54.35]I have to stop the stream.
[198:56.83]I gotta stop.
[198:58.71]I'm just gonna go back to the Nexus and say my goodbyes.
[199:05.16]Sorry.
[199:05.52]I'm gonna try to get this situated and get this shit figured out by Thursday.
[199:28.68]Fuck me.
[199:36.24]It must have been from when the car exploded.
[199:38.06]Yeah, I don't know.
[199:40.94]Good night, everybody.
[199:42.35]Sorry I'm cutting this short.
[199:43.33]I wanted to go for at least like four hours tonight, but I just can't.
[199:47.39]But thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the $5.
[199:49.09]Here's some money for some over-the-counter, off-the-counter meds.
[199:53.45]Thank you, Sticks.
[199:55.13]Thank you also, Smitty, for the $5.

[200:03.94]Here's $20 for the copay.
[200:04.94]Yeah, you can take off sub-bullying mode now.
[200:12.75]Thank you for the $20.
[200:13.57]Appreciate it.
[200:15.59]That's very kind of you.
[200:17.45]I'm gonna go see a priest.
[200:20.15]I'm gonna go to a priest and tell him just to hold my head and scream a bunch of stuff in a different language.
[200:25.78]Like, what if I went to a church and I'm like, hey, listen, Doc.
[200:29.50]I'm in the church, by the way.
[200:30.66]Like, hey, Doc, let me ask you something.
[200:32.55]Like, can you just, like, expel the demons from my brain?
[200:37.69]I'm gonna try.
[200:37.99]I'm gonna do it.
[200:38.63]I'm gonna go to church and be like, expel me.
[200:41.13]I'm gonna go into the fucking booth.
[200:43.49]I'm gonna go into, like, the kissing booth, whatever the hell it is.
[200:46.85]And he's gonna open up the thing and I'm gonna be like, Father, forgive me for I have a headache.
[200:51.29]I can appreciate it if you could just get rid of it.
[200:57.14]He's going to have to get 80 bucks.
[200:58.28]And he's got $80.
[200:58.68]I'll never go to my truck.
[201:03.98]Good night, everybody.
[201:06.24]MooMeansMoo, thanks for $5.
[201:07.51]Somebody put gross beat on this game's master channel.
[201:09.99]I don't even know what that means, but thank you for the $5.
[201:12.69]Tara, thanks for the $2.
[201:13.79]Please load up Dark Souls one of these days so we can show you where the elevator in Light Town is.
[201:19.91]Maybe one day.
[201:20.41]Thank you, TimMachine9.
[201:23.53]Respect me.
[201:24.11]I already do.
[201:27.83]Frog Zone, thanks for the bits.
[201:29.79]Three bucks.
[201:30.29]Thanks for the countless hours of entertainment.
[201:31.72]Please locate these bits towards the clown car joke.
[201:33.56]I think I already got up to this point, but thank you.
[201:38.06]And that's where I'm going to end the stream.
[201:39.84]Wish me luck.
[201:40.34]I'm going to take some Ibuprofen to go lie down.
[201:46.84]Have a good one.
[201:48.20]Again, I am, like, so sorry that, like, we got... We started, like, to get it.
[201:50.92]I beat, like, the first boss.
[201:53.00]And it was like, oh, here we go.
[201:54.45]We're getting started.
[201:55.31]Two hours, three hours in.
[201:57.47]And then all of a sudden it's like, no, no, you don't.
[201:59.09]Sorry.
[201:59.47]You, like, screamed out loud at an enemy and now you have a migraine.
[202:02.85]So, I'm sorry, guys.
[202:05.33]I'll catch you guys on Thursday.
[202:06.39]We're probably gonna do more of this.
[202:09.85]I would assume we're gonna continue this.
[202:11.65]Because I'm having fun.
[202:13.09]So, goodnight, guys.
[202:14.04]Good luck.
[202:14.82]Take care, everybody.
