[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.10]Hey, good afternoon, guys.
[00:11.15]How you doing?
[00:11.79]Good afternoon.
[00:12.45]I think we're ready to go.
[00:40.13]Hello?
[00:42.79]So I gotta apologize right off the bat.
[00:45.89]This, uh, I'm in my new office kind of area in this place.
[00:52.29]And I'm in the process of putting up, like, sound panels.
[00:56.35]But it's still a little echoey in here, so I gotta, uh,
[01:00.24]Gotta say sorry.
[01:03.94]Until that's all done, it's gonna be a little roomy in here.
[01:08.12]But you know.
[01:09.54]Whatever.
[01:12.56]My nude... Yeah, this is the office where I get nude.
[01:14.54]This is my nude office.
[01:16.40]I just get nude in here.
[01:24.72]Alright, so today...
[01:27.14]Or tonight.
[01:28.34]We're gonna play, uh, Cryptark.
[01:30.64]It's a game that came out in early access.
[01:33.16]Not that long ago, a couple days ago or so.
[01:38.64]It's a kind of roguelike space shooter, sort of twin stick, bullet hell type game.
[01:46.43]That's kind of a weird way to describe it.
[01:47.83]It's not really that.
[01:48.97]It's more of like a try to take money from spaceship game.
[01:55.26]I actually really don't even know.
[01:56.56]I have no idea.
[01:58.16]I just know what I've read about it.
[02:02.48]But, apparently very good things.
[02:04.64]I've heard extremely good things about this game.
[02:08.07]And there's another reason why we're playing this game too.
[02:10.41]There's another very specific reason why we're going to play this game.
[02:14.87]You'll see very soon.
[02:19.69]Do you like my hold on a second screen?
[02:24.02]I literally drew this in less than 15 seconds.
[02:32.90]So we'll let some people trickle in before we do this.
[02:43.71]Can I sell your DNA on the internet for money?
[02:47.83]Uh, uh, no.
[02:51.86]No, that's pretty fucked up.
[03:03.06]Wait, my initial question, where'd you get it?
[03:05.50]Where the hell did you get this?
[03:13.79]Why not play Styx?
[03:15.95]No, I'm not playing Styx.
[03:20.00]Okay, let me get this up.
[03:27.84]I actually have heard of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
[03:30.43]Seems really, really fun.
[03:32.23]Don't you need like three or four people to play that game, though?
[03:36.83]It's a game where you have like at least three people, right?
[03:47.10]What time is it?
[03:48.14]It's 1130 right now.
[03:50.08]1126.
[03:56.50]Only two.
[03:57.00]You only need two people?
[03:59.10]That's pretty sweet.
[04:00.76]Maybe me and Star can play it at some point.
[04:03.03]Or somebody else, but it doesn't matter who it is.
[04:16.05]007, I remember that.
[04:16.77]007 was such a good game.
[04:19.61]For its time, that was like way ahead of its time.
[04:23.21]That like FPS multiplayer type game, that was never... It was like the first of its kind, really.
[04:27.94]It definitely matters who it is.
[04:33.96]Well, it doesn't really matter.
[04:34.84]Well, you don't think that would be equally as entertaining with like Boo?
[04:39.65]Or like MLC stuff?
[04:43.05]Doesn't always have to be Star, guys.
[04:46.61]Plus, Star is in prison.
[04:48.53]How am I gonna play with him?
[04:54.45]PAX East is not till next year, man.
[04:56.41]Not till, like, April or something next year.
[04:59.01]Or March or whatever.
[04:59.71]Alright, well... We're gonna get going.
[05:07.41]I just wanted to give it a minute or two, so people can kind of trickle in.
[05:14.84]We're going to open this game up.
[05:15.78]This game is apparently very hard, so please don't be mad at me if I can't do this well.
[05:24.73]So let's do it.
[05:30.81]Okay.
[05:33.75]And get the hold on second screen off.
[05:40.15]Hey, look at that!
[05:40.65]There's a video game on the screen now.
[05:44.36]Alright, so let's play it.
[05:47.28]I don't know a whole lot.
[05:48.04]I know it's a shooter, kind of side-scrolly, top-down, break-in, steal the stuff, take the core, get out.
[05:55.39]But, you know, whatever.
[05:56.49]Let's just go.
[05:58.69]I actually have played this game for like 30 seconds.
[06:02.31]So.
[06:04.74]I don't really know a whole lot.
[06:07.64]But I do know this.
[06:10.08]Let's go ahead and do the tutorial.
[06:12.47]Why not?
[06:12.83]You know, sometimes when you start a new game up, how are you supposed to know how to play, you know?
[06:18.27]You gotta do the goddamn tutorial.
[06:20.31]Let's watch.
[06:28.78]Oh, look at those characters.
[06:38.77]Look at those characters.
[06:55.68]Let's go There we are
[07:23.68]Yeah, I know nothing about this game.
[07:24.90]I just know, like, the first 30 seconds.
[07:50.05]So we gotta take over this ship.
[07:52.56]Difficulty 1, Class Envoy.
[07:54.20]Goal time, 4.07.
[07:55.28]Okay.
[08:02.35]Let's go ahead and launch.
[08:07.91]Let's load up this first level.
[08:17.39]Local vector with target vessel is locked.
[08:19.79]Operate light screen.
[08:22.47]Hangar depressurized.
[08:24.09]Move out to the arming area and carefully, you know, bang up my flight deck.
[08:27.89]Who the fuck's that?
[08:30.79]Who's this motherfucker talking right now?
[08:32.38]Alright, let's go.
[08:39.70]Alright, so this is what it looks like.
[08:40.88]That's me.
[08:43.20]Hehehe.
[08:48.42]Hold E to open doors?
[08:49.71]Okay, easy.
[08:50.61]Yeah, yeah, move the mouse to aim.
[08:53.53]Good controls.
[08:54.15]It's pretty smooth.
[09:16.41]That's pretty cool.
[09:23.69]That's awkward.
[09:25.05]Hard to even see where I'm going.
[09:29.41]Alright, grenade is F. I might rebind that.
[09:37.96]Finally, fire up that shield generator.
[09:40.50]I'd rather you burn out the power cell than bring my suit back with holes in it.
[09:45.03]And that's the shield.
[09:48.23]Alright.
[09:48.57]There's the dash, the shield.
[09:53.74]Interesting.
[09:58.92]Why didn't you actually learn an extraterrestrial language to prepare for your role?
[10:02.22]Shameful display.
[10:06.81]Okay, let's see what we're looking at here.
[10:09.71]Pull up your tactical map.
[10:11.03]Now let's figure out a plan of attack.
[10:14.61]Open up the map This is all important information that I'm like learning for the first time so bear with me if I'm being like silent So you take out the shields
[10:45.14]scanner sweep also indicates multiple other security systems are active as well take a look around and plan to take out modules that might be a problem this is kind of like the swindle right like you get by the way this is all procedurally generated I believe so we can just take a look at okay this is the shield that protects a single system with an impenetrable energy shield
[11:13.53]So this is blocking this.
[11:16.02]Okay, so this has to go down before the core can be destroyed.
[11:21.44]It controls the multitudes of interior defense turrets.
[11:23.64]So if I destroy this, there's turrets that are going to be here and all kinds of stuff.
[11:26.80]This is locked.
[11:27.10]I don't know what the hell this is.
[11:30.49]Alright, let's just go.
[11:31.73]Let's just play.
[11:33.95]Let's do it.
[11:34.33]There's nothing else I can really do here.
[11:36.43]That's my shield.
[11:38.63]I want to turn F. I want to make it something else if I can.
[11:43.04]I have a different button I'd like to do.
[11:55.29]I don't know.
[11:55.66]I'm apparently going to need to use my other mouse.
[11:57.64]Let's see.
[11:58.06]Mouse 4.
[12:00.16]That works for me.
[12:05.26]Did I do it?
[12:10.97]Um...
[12:15.43]Should have done it, right?
[12:20.14]Oh, let me reset it.
[12:24.32]Yeah, I don't know why that didn't do it.
[12:28.73]Did I use all the grenades?
[12:33.01]Maybe I don't have any grenades left.
[12:34.19]Where's the indicator?
[12:35.37]Because that's mouse 4.
[12:40.22]It's not working.
[12:43.48]Uh-oh.
[12:44.74]Now I'll just put it back to F, whatever.
[12:45.94]I'll put it on Q. Maybe Q is probably easier.
[12:56.88]Oh, whoops.
[12:58.18]Q is my, like, change scene button.
[13:00.30]Oh, shit.
[13:01.56]Oh, I gotta... Well, we definitely can't make it Q.
[13:17.07]Because I can't get it to be mouse support.
[13:18.35]Alright, but let's just play.
[13:19.83]I've sat here long enough.
[13:24.03]Now, I believe there's a timer, yeah.
[13:31.14]Oh, shit.
[13:31.66]It's going right now.
[13:35.06]I didn't even plan my attack.
[13:36.58]We're just going right in the front door.
[13:37.62]Okay, the shield is up to the top left, right?
[13:44.09]Repair supply.
[13:44.81]I don't need to do that.
[13:51.12]Whoa, okay, they can't hurt you.
[13:52.69]These are turrets.
[13:53.31]These turrets can hurt you, for sure.
[13:57.79]I got 1,400 of my machine gun, which is good.
[13:59.71]Here's the shield.
[14:02.09]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:10.35]Oh, it's a reflector.
[14:11.09]That's a reflector.
[14:11.81]Okay, I got it.
[14:12.75]You got to be real careful.
[14:13.59]I'm going to shoot some grenades in there.
[14:17.20]That's the way to do it.
[14:21.22]I didn't even see that guy to the left.
[14:26.59]This is pretty damn cool, though.
[14:30.29]What is that?
[14:32.69]Some piece of... I gotta look at the Metroid mini-map.
[14:36.39]Key terminal?
[14:41.31]I guess I got a key.
[14:44.10]Apparently.
[14:44.56]There's another key?
[14:47.80]Let's open it up.
[14:49.38]Ooh, I can now open that.
[14:50.18]Okay, I get it.
[14:50.60]I get it.
[14:50.88]I get it.
[14:54.76]Health is in the bottom.
[14:57.11]The brain is up here, but I have, like, two minutes.
[15:00.95]Maybe I should go down and... Okay, tech advance.
[15:04.57]What does this do?
[15:05.83]Keep an eye out for these alien terminals.
[15:07.99]In exchange for their databanks, our benefactors will be providing us with new equipment licenses for better...
[15:14.84]Okay.
[15:16.54]So I picked these up to get better shit.
[15:19.46]Thanks, me.
[15:20.60]Thanks for telling me how to play.
[15:23.90]I am running out of time.
[15:26.46]No.
[15:28.24]I don't get any more ammo after this.
[15:31.13]I probably should just try to do the first little tutorial area first.
[15:36.15]Up here, right?
[15:37.19]Yeah, there it is.
[15:40.83]There's the brain.
[15:48.13]Only got a minute and 40 seconds left.
[15:55.21]I gotta get these little shits out of her, that's important.
[16:03.91]Oh, is this like, quadrant to the brain?
[16:05.55]That's pretty sick.
[16:08.99]Ow.
[16:13.73]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[16:14.99]Ow, ow, ow.
[16:15.92]Oh boy, not good, not good, not good.
[16:19.21]Probably should have taken out the turret system.
[16:20.99]Oh boy.
[16:26.68]Oh shit.
[16:30.00]I'm getting yelled at.
[16:33.64]So I gotta go to, okay, repair pod.
[16:35.48]Are these things spawning from somewhere?
[16:39.96]I thought I killed these guys.
[16:40.98]Alright, I already, okay, I have one on me.
[16:44.81]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[16:52.05]There we go.
[16:52.89]Now I got free reign to kill the brain.
[16:59.81]Boink.
[17:00.05]Got the core.
[17:01.29]Yeah, I just scolded myself.
[17:02.37]That's next level scolding.
[17:03.13]Alright.
[17:20.42]Alright.
[17:20.72]So, it costs money to attack.
[17:21.44]Difficulty 1.
[17:21.80]These are all fairly simple, except for that one.
[17:23.58]These are both harder.
[17:51.90]No supply pods.
[17:54.34]Those are little bonuses.
[17:55.18]That's cool.
[17:59.72]They use dollars instead of galactic credits.
[18:01.94]Oh, this is unrealistic.
[18:02.96]94,000.
[18:06.19]I'm going to stay with the baby ships because I'm still learning the game.
[18:13.37]Tech advances four.
[18:16.21]Where's the disco?
[18:17.09]The disco is the cheapest one.
[18:19.63]I got about five minutes to beat it.
[18:25.58]Although long dormant highly guarded multiple factory systems.
[18:29.37]Alright, let's go Alright Hey look at this we got our mid-touch some new equipment licenses plug it in a loadout rig here and I'll get you out kid
[18:49.36]Oh, that part was ad-libbed.
[18:50.70]See, there was no Sonny there.
[18:52.68]Whatever the brilliant actor was, added that little part at the end there, just a little bit of an insight.
[19:00.62]Right, let's get down to business.
[19:02.48]You got four weapon points that can carry whatever hardware we got licenses for.
[19:08.16]I can modify the amount of hull durability your suit has as well.
[19:11.91]Bolting on extra plating can get pricey, though.
[19:16.11]Lastly, there's four utility item brackets that can be loaded up with whatever goodies you think might come in handy.
[19:25.43]Oh, so humble.
[19:26.41]I'm just kidding.
[19:27.31]It's a joke.
[19:28.45]We're just choking here.
[19:32.02]Okay.
[19:33.46]So, what do I have here?
[19:34.40]This is $36,000.
[19:35.18]I can... Where's my money?
[19:39.56]I can also... Can I sell it, too?
[19:43.04]I'm just gonna go with default now.
[19:49.30]So this is what I can put here.
[19:50.32]So I can get keys, I can bring a nuke.
[19:51.60]I'm gonna keep the fix.
[19:52.65]Two fixes.
[19:52.91]What's the key?
[19:53.35]So I can get through one key and it's $8,000.
[20:20.00]I don't think I... No, I think I can do one fix.
[20:22.77]I should be alright.
[20:28.45]What else do we got here?
[20:31.23]Oh, jeez.
[20:31.75]There's even more weapons?
[20:35.84]I don't... The spike is cool, but... Okay, shotgun.
[20:41.86]224k.
[20:43.54]Let me try the shotgun.
[20:49.18]We'll go with 200.
[20:50.14]No, we're going to go with 100, just in case I don't like it.
[20:53.46]Yeah, 50, just in case I hate it.
[20:57.66]So the machine gun, that's fine.
[20:59.14]Although, maybe... 1500 is fine.
[21:06.84]Shield should probably stay there.
[21:08.84]It helps.
[21:12.60]Bombs.
[21:12.90]We're going to stay with the shield.
[21:16.09]Here are the grenades.
[21:25.75]Sticky grenades.
[21:28.51]I was barely using these, so I'm just gonna... I'm gonna say zero.
[21:32.47]We'll save them, you know, we'll get more bang for our buck.
[21:38.48]I'm gonna try the shotgun, and I will put on another thing of health.
[21:43.56]Maybe two more things of health.
[21:47.18]Get $500,000.
[21:50.24]I get 69,000 for beating this.
[21:52.62]So I can't, maybe I shouldn't be doing that.
[21:55.33]Because I'm just going to be in the red.
[21:59.99]Ah, fuck it, whatever.
[22:01.21]Who cares.
[22:01.59]That's the way we're going to do it.
[22:07.08]How do I go?
[22:10.06]There it is.
[22:11.49]Hey, remember, all this stuff's gotta be paid for.
[22:14.75]Equipment costs are only logged after you leave the hangar.
[22:18.17]So feel free to test out new weapons on the target sim.
[22:21.93]Oh, cool.
[22:22.75]So I can just use them.
[22:26.13]Ooh, I like the shotgun.
[22:32.36]Shotgun's actually pretty damn cool.
[22:37.28]I think I'm liking this.
[22:38.32]I think I am.
[22:38.86]I like the shotgun.
[22:39.56]I'm gonna try shotgun shoddy guy.
[22:48.38]What the fuck is this?
[22:53.65]How did I get connected with this game?
[22:55.05]This is actually made by the same people that made Apotheon.
[22:58.27]Alien Trap.
[22:59.79]And the guy that was the casting director for Apotheon is a guy that I happen to know from the old voice acting communities.
[23:07.00]And he got me in touch again.
[23:08.50]I auditioned.
[23:10.06]And they liked it, so I'm in the game.
[23:12.68]That's pretty much it.
[23:14.98]Let's go steal some stuff.
[23:16.10]Let's go blow up a core.
[23:20.10]Alright, let's look at this.
[23:21.24]This is important.
[23:23.30]Here's the core.
[23:25.64]Alarm system.
[23:30.84]So that protects the core.
[23:32.06]This is going to be kind of harder.
[23:35.07]Oh, this is tiny!
[23:35.77]This is a little one, huh?
[23:36.77]This is a little baby ship.
[23:37.83]I forgot.
[23:38.23]So if I go in this door... No, no.
[23:40.93]If I go in this door... This is the thing that spawns enemies.
[23:49.88]I'm gonna come in the back door, destroy the thing that spawns the enemies, then wrap around this way, come up to destroy the alarm system, and then core gets taken out.
[24:05.72]Nothing but net.
[24:06.78]Let's go.
[24:10.37]Here, okay, confirm loadout, 88,000.
[24:11.75]I feel like this is very wasteful, but I'll learn that as we go.
[24:18.56]I only have four and a half minutes.
[24:21.57]Right in the back door.
[24:27.97]Oh, whoa, lots of people down here.
[24:37.93]Whoa.
[24:39.31]Holy shit, that hurt.
[24:41.61]This thing up above is hitting me.
[24:43.49]I'm freaking out.
[24:44.17]I, I, I, calm down.
[24:45.41]I gotta calm down here.
[24:48.11]I went way too... I went too fast.
[24:50.93]I should've just slowed down.
[24:58.55]This guy's got a lot of health.
[25:00.41]Oh shit.
[25:00.97]Alarm triggered.
[25:01.69]What?
[25:02.65]What happened?
[25:03.91]Yeah, I did all the laser effects.
[25:06.15]All these sound effects are here, I did them with my mouth.
[25:17.52]no that's not true they're very talented sound designers on this game as well as their actors and I'm taking way too many hits here
[25:42.28]There goes that.
[25:44.02]Whoa, what the fuck is happening to my character?
[25:45.96]I'm getting pulled in.
[25:46.86]I just got sucked in.
[25:48.50]Alright, note to self.
[25:49.80]They suck you in.
[25:51.20]Good to know.
[25:55.15]Tech.
[25:57.55]Key.
[25:59.01]Fuck.
[26:00.55]Give me that heal.
[26:07.82]Damn.
[26:14.93]I can hurt the brain, but it triggers the alarm.
[26:21.40]I'm out of repairs.
[26:23.94]So maybe I should have brought... I thought that was five.
[26:27.12]No, okay, I get it now.
[26:28.34]That's five health points, not five in the slots.
[26:31.67]Look at how many enemies there are.
[26:34.19]Quick, get that tech upgrade!
[26:36.41]That's what I should have just said right there.
[26:40.63]I think we're just gonna go for it.
[26:41.63]I think we're just gonna go for it.
[26:42.37]Just destroy it.
[26:44.29]Bullet health.
[26:45.20]I'm dead.
[26:48.60]Okay.
[26:49.12]Alright, I get it.
[26:53.45]I just lost a budget.
[26:54.61]I just lost a hundred grand.
[26:58.96]Shit.
[27:02.38]That was cool though.
[27:05.78]Now that I know how that works, and now we're back here, and I believe these are all generated again.
[27:15.98]We're gonna go with the baby one again.
[27:17.49]This time I'm gonna put multiple heals in.
[27:21.19]Now I know triggering the alarm switches, it's pretty... The plan didn't work.
[27:31.85]Okay, let's go down, get another heal.
[27:36.23]That's $10,000.
[27:38.49]I did get an upgrade.
[27:39.37]What is this?
[27:39.75]Sensor.
[27:41.35]Deep wave radar receptors and an advanced mole bat tunneling processor allows the sensor package to reveal a wider area.
[27:50.08]I don't think I need that yet.
[27:55.40]15 grand for a nuke.
[27:56.44]I don't know.
[27:57.10]I'd rather just get another heal just because I'm a fucking shitty.
[28:03.64]I might as well reset.
[28:05.14]By the way, this is kind of like a roguelike.
[28:06.52]When you're out of money, I believe the game is over.
[28:12.04]I'm already down 100k.
[28:16.16]Still have the shotgun.
[28:17.72]Still have the shield.
[28:20.44]And we'll go with that.
[28:21.12]This time I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[28:25.98]God, that was a lot of money.
[28:29.86]This one's layout is a little different.
[28:34.91]Brain is down here this time.
[28:36.39]Alright.
[28:39.18]I'm just gonna be more careful.
[28:40.26]I got way too gung-ho.
[28:41.72]I just went straight in.
[28:43.88]It's locked.
[28:46.14]Just gotta be careful.
[28:47.04]You just slow it down.
[28:48.10]This is like... It's kind of like Binding of Isaac.
[28:50.04]You know what I mean?
[28:50.46]You don't just like run in the room and run around like a fucking psychopath.
[29:01.01]Couple attack upgrades here.
[29:04.54]Key.
[29:12.82]There we go.
[29:14.16]Let's open this door.
[29:17.88]This is where the turrets are being shot from.
[29:22.42]Clear out the little, clear out the trash.
[29:24.14]If you learned anything from World of Warcraft, clear out the trash.
[29:30.77]Okay, that's gonna, holy, that's gonna be hard to do.
[29:41.34]Alright.
[29:43.70]Sentry systems now destroyed.
[29:44.98]I can move freely without getting aggro from them.
[29:50.58]There's a tech upgrade in here.
[29:51.77]I don't have a key, though.
[29:52.73]Except now I... Now I do.
[29:57.97]Only a minute and a half left.
[29:58.95]I gotta keep going.
[29:59.73]Okay.
[30:12.42]I'm running out of time.
[30:13.12]I'm running out of time.
[30:20.18]It's have and have not.
[30:21.77]This is a game of haves and have nots.
[30:23.71]Am I going the right way?
[30:25.13]Nope.
[30:26.11]Not even close.
[30:26.73]At least I can go through here.
[30:35.12]Is there a way to get in this back way?
[30:36.54]Oh, what poor planning.
[30:43.66]One minute.
[30:44.04]No, there's no way I'm gonna do this in one minute.
[30:53.59]Fuck it.
[30:55.05]We gotta go.
[30:56.49]I have 45 seconds to kill the brain.
[30:59.45]Wow, time is not on your side in this game.
[31:04.47]Let's go sound the alarms, I don't give a shit.
[31:05.79]30 seconds.
[31:19.12]25 seconds, come on!
[31:20.64]Thank god.
[31:24.97]Whew.
[31:27.11]Damn.
[31:27.41]So my revenue was... How much did I spend?
[31:30.05]A hundred and something thousand?
[31:45.17]So my actual net, like actual gain, was like $30,000.
[31:49.30]This is pretty cool.
[31:53.84]This is pretty cool.
[31:57.24]I will say, I am... Oh, would you look at that?
[32:03.62]That's why this is cool.
[32:05.12]So, you have a choice between four ships.
[32:12.42]You could either spend a little bit more money, do the really hard ones, because you have to go through these five slots.
[32:18.73]See, like, down here, you gotta do one, two, three, four, five, and then you get to the Kryptar.
[32:25.83]Let's go with the hard one.
[32:26.69]You know, let's just see.
[32:27.44]I'm just curious.
[32:28.36]Now, I'm gonna get my ass kicked, but I'm curious to see what, like, a three difficulty one is like.
[32:32.48]I'm sure they go up to ten or something.
[32:38.20]Think of all the slabs of granite you could have bought with that money.
[32:41.85]Quite a few.
[32:44.30]We're gonna do the really really ultra super level 2 hard one.
[32:50.00]This one looks pretty big too.
[32:53.00]Six and a half minutes.
[32:56.90]Destroy the sensor jammers for an extra 34k.
[32:59.29]Let's just go for it.
[33:12.46]We got another tutorial!
[33:15.22]Oh, no we don't.
[33:21.90]What do I have for this heavy machine gun ricochet?
[33:31.67]Lots of recoil, but the bullets ricochet?
[33:39.00]What's the price difference?
[33:42.34]Medium machine gun.
[33:43.22]Burst.
[33:44.16]Smart.
[33:48.19]Ooh.
[33:52.19]Advanced smart gun?
[33:53.23]A zip gun?
[34:01.91]We'll go with the zip gun.
[34:04.14]How much money is the zip gun in comparison?
[34:05.72]Not that much more.
[34:06.68]Zip gun.
[34:07.06]3,000 bolts.
[34:17.58]Am I going to stay with the shotgun?
[34:21.50]Yeah.
[34:22.60]It's kind of tried and true, right?
[34:23.86]How many bullets?
[34:25.56]50.
[34:25.88]50's been working pretty well.
[34:27.42]Could probably even go lower.
[34:28.58]No, you can only go 50.
[34:33.46]Actually, I want to put this on... Okay, let's do 10 grenades on mouse 3.
[34:43.88]Mouse 2.
[34:44.25]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:48.82]That shield is too good.
[34:50.62]You can't take this off.
[34:55.68]What does this do?
[34:57.45]Blaster?
[35:03.37]If the zip gun isn't voice acted by Jeremiah, I'll be upset.
[35:08.85]I'll stay with the shield for now.
[35:10.23]I don't want any... I mean, I should take grenades, but I wish I could just change the keybind.
[35:15.39]F is kind of awkward to press when most, 90% of the stuff you're doing is on the mouse.
[35:21.23]But, whatever.
[35:23.55]Didn't I find something else here?
[35:25.59]No.
[35:27.59]I'm gonna take a key.
[35:29.71]Now that I, like, kind of know what the hell's going on, I think I'm okay with having one of these fixers.
[35:39.82]Because I barely took any damage that last run.
[35:42.50]Now that I know not to be like a psychopath about everything.
[35:48.07]You can even, you can take this down.
[35:51.39]Right?
[35:52.03]So you could, if you were confident enough, you could save yourself like $40,000.
[35:55.17]If you knew you weren't going to get hit more than one time.
[35:59.46]Or two times.
[36:03.48]Where's it going to go with, you know what, we're going to go with 8.
[36:07.45]This is a $74,000 mission.
[36:10.23]I get 141 if I beat it, and the bonuses.
[36:14.21]Let's just get our asses kicked.
[36:15.77]Why not, huh?
[36:19.48]Let's take a look at what we're dealing with.
[36:20.90]Oh, fuck.
[36:21.94]Awww.
[36:22.04]Haha.
[36:36.82]That's evil!
[36:41.61]So I guess I could take one of those sensors, right?
[36:44.95]Don't I have those things?
[36:56.72]I think I do.
[36:57.68]$8,000 to be able to see not that far in front of me.
[37:00.72]Let's try it.
[37:02.60]We'll go for it.
[37:04.80]Like, does that mean I can see things now?
[37:08.32]I'm seeing a repair system on board this vessel.
[37:10.56]Its drones will attempt to fix other systems you may have already destroyed.
[37:14.73]I recommend removing it as quickly as you can.
[37:19.32]So this thing will repair other things that I've destroyed.
[37:23.14]So that thing's gotta go.
[37:24.68]What is this?
[37:25.68]That's the jammer.
[37:27.70]If there's a way to get in right here, or like here, I can grab the intel, take out the drone factory repair system, come around, poke the thing in the eye, rip around, get rid of the turret system, swoop, shoot, bang, shield generator down, and the alarm system down.
[37:46.58]Thank you very much, I'll take my 200 grand.
[37:52.09]You heard it here first.
[37:55.58]So that's what that does.
[37:56.96]There's a door right here.
[37:58.78]What do you know?
[38:00.50]We're going to be good to go.
[38:03.82]Holy shit, that's loud.
[38:08.42]I'm sorry, everybody.
[38:09.36]That's very loud.
[38:11.66]It's a zip gun.
[38:14.31]Forgot, forgot.
[38:15.55]I forgot.
[38:15.87]Where am I?
[38:18.21]Oh, that just totally ruined my whole plan.
[38:20.09]Get me out of here.
[38:22.93]Get the fuck out of here.
[38:25.25]Bye.
[38:25.87]I'm going back to my original plan.
[38:28.09]Can I?
[38:33.21]Shit.
[38:33.98]Come on.
[38:34.30]There's gotta be like a secret entrance up here I can break through, right?
[38:38.22]There is.
[38:46.24]Ow!
[38:56.93]Zip gun is sick.
[39:01.69]We're going for speed French gun
[39:15.87]Hard to shoot the zip gun in here because it's so inaccurate.
[39:21.95]There it goes.
[39:22.55]Where's the brain?
[39:24.99]Okay, brain.
[39:30.09]Fuck.
[39:30.65]There's the brain.
[39:34.01]Easy, easy, careful, careful.
[39:35.51]Take a, take a heal.
[39:37.52]I got five minutes to do this.
[39:39.74]In fact, I could probably...
[39:44.13]I don't think I'm going to get the brain just yet.
[39:46.10]I went through the secret entrance.
[39:50.12]Drone factory.
[39:51.02]Oh, shit.
[39:51.44]No, we've got to go.
[39:52.08]Is that the shield?
[39:59.91]I hope not.
[40:04.61]Big mistake.
[40:05.31]Big mistake.
[40:13.24]I don't think I can hurt the other side yet.
[40:15.20]That's not good.
[40:21.23]No, now I can.
[40:26.19]Alright.
[40:27.55]No, I got three health.
[40:28.59]I got three health.
[40:29.21]Just end it.
[40:32.01]Three HP?
[40:32.81]No way.
[40:39.14]Yeah, I didn't take out the repair thing because my everything got all screwed up.
[40:44.76]Look at that money.
[40:47.88]No supply pods.
[40:49.48]I didn't destroy the jammers.
[40:50.56]297k?
[40:53.82]I'll take it.
[40:54.38]Alright, don't be messing around.
[41:16.86]I'm pretty sure the only reason why I'm alive is probably, dude, that's probably true.
[41:20.28]These are bigger.
[41:24.47]I don't know, man.
[41:30.55]What's the difference between these?
[41:33.99]These ones are more money, but... There must just be more stuff.
[41:39.98]See, all those icons in the lower right, I don't even know what the hell any of those mean.
[41:50.36]We'll play this one a little bit safer.
[41:53.90]3, 5, 5.
[41:54.44]Hey.
[41:58.46]Would Benjamin Franklin have taken this the safe way?
[42:02.04]He would have started the goddamn revolution and been the best president we've ever had.
[42:08.43]We're going with Danger 5.
[42:09.27]How do you think he got on that 100?
[42:12.61]You think he got on that 100 by taking a bath?
[42:16.73]No.
[42:17.53]No.
[42:18.97]He was the best electric president we've ever had.
[42:25.18]See, Benjamin Franklin wasn't a president.
[42:27.70]But who cares?
[42:30.18]Only damn president on the money that's not on the money, you know, that's on the money.
[42:36.68]Yeah.
[42:39.37]I got a new weapon.
[42:39.99]Let's take a look at what it is.
[42:44.87]I do like the zip gun.
[42:48.60]Trench gun.
[42:50.04]Sawed-off double-barreled shotgun.
[42:52.74]Slow to reload.
[42:54.88]Nothing compares to a brutal one-two punch.
[43:00.70]What if I do double shotgun?
[43:02.98]That sounds kind of fun, right?
[43:10.43]If we're doing a hard one, though, I don't know.
[43:12.67]That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[43:18.35]Let's try the other guns.
[43:19.37]Advanced Smart Gun.
[43:22.44]It's too expensive.
[43:24.62]Is it really worth it to have, like, a homing?
[43:25.98]This one's homing.
[43:27.60]And it's almost $15,000, $12,000 less expensive.
[43:32.03]For more bullets.
[43:35.83]We'll give it a try.
[43:36.39]I feel like that's not enough, though.
[43:42.01]We'll go with the default.
[43:44.10]And we'll do the shot off shotgun.
[43:48.17]Can't take the shield off.
[43:49.25]It's too good.
[43:52.43]I don't even care.
[43:53.13]I don't really even like this sensor.
[43:55.75]That's $8,000 I don't need to spend.
[43:57.81]At least not now.
[44:01.15]Should I do it?
[44:05.12]I could do double zip gun.
[44:06.68]And blow everybody's eardrums out.
[44:13.76]I'll keep it on.
[44:14.58]This is a big job.
[44:17.97]I like the key.
[44:18.61]I don't care about the grenades.
[44:22.43]It's money I don't have to spend.
[44:30.32]I feel like I'm gonna run out of ammo.
[44:33.76]But, who cares?
[44:37.12]I'm gonna be a millionaire after this one anyways.
[44:41.92]Uh oh.
[44:42.60]Really?
[44:42.76]What does that mean?
[44:43.70]Okay, this gun is pretty amazing.
[44:46.05]You can just go like this and shoot around corners.
[45:10.13]Look at how much ammo I'm blowing, though.
[45:14.31]Whoa!
[45:17.09]Best gun in the game.
[45:19.02]Sawed-off shotgun is probably the best.
[45:20.68]Look at this thing.
[45:21.14]Look at the spread.
[45:24.24]I like this loadout.
[45:28.12]Oh, stealth.
[45:28.92]You like the voice?
[45:33.17]Let's go.
[45:33.95]Let's do it.
[45:34.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:34.65]There's a lot of enemies here.
[45:35.43]What the hell?
[45:35.85]Holy shit.
[45:36.43]It's tiny.
[45:36.79]This one is so small.
[45:37.59]There's a ton of enemies, but it's tiny.
[45:39.27]Provides all drones aboard the ship with an additional 25% health.
[45:41.93]Shit.
[45:42.11]There's the point of entry.
[46:09.83]This one's multiple ships connected together.
[46:13.31]How much time do I have?
[46:14.03]Seven and a half minutes?
[46:15.43]Take it slow.
[46:17.85]I got a key.
[46:18.37]I can go right in here.
[46:20.33]Let's go.
[46:26.96]Actually, hold on.
[46:30.26]I can get in.
[46:30.78]Yeah, I can.
[46:31.52]I have a key.
[46:34.74]This is scary.
[46:36.20]I'm scared to open this door.
[46:37.18]Yeah, there's their shield.
[46:42.58]Wow!
[46:47.84]Bullets in every direction.
[46:50.33]Why did I do this one?
[46:52.67]Why did I do this hard one?
[46:54.43]Fucking Benjamin Franklin.
[46:57.10]I should have taken... I should have taken like the fucking Alexander Van Grant.
[47:02.26]Whatever his name was.
[47:03.20]What was his name?
[47:03.69]Anthony... Anthony Grant?
[47:05.95]What was that president?
[47:06.79]Oh my god!
[47:11.23]Get me out of here!
[47:12.43]Get me out!
[47:15.45]Oh my god, my game is like crashing.
[47:18.61]They're following me out of the ship.
[47:26.29]Oh wow, that was... I was not prepared for that one.
[47:30.97]Ulysses S. Grant.
[47:32.09]That was like a general.
[47:33.15]That wasn't even a president.
[47:36.87]They can't hurt me if I'm out here.
[47:39.36]Now they can.
[47:44.50]Just get away from these guys.
[47:47.64]Jesus.
[47:53.16]Tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech upgrades.
[47:55.68]Chain gun.
[48:00.21]This thing has a shield.
[48:01.07]This is bad.
[48:03.55]Are those green bubbles?
[48:04.65]Can I... This thing's a huge knockback.
[48:10.95]Why am I... Alright, their armor is down.
[48:22.96]Those turrets are unbearable.
[48:31.67]Oh boy.
[48:36.39]That's it?
[48:37.69]Wait, that's not it?
[48:39.81]Is that not it?
[48:43.05]That's not it?
[48:45.33]So there's like a Left 4 Dead style, you gotta get one last chance thing in this game?
[48:54.60]I can't tell enemies health and everything.
[48:56.00]This is... This is bad.
[48:58.34]I'm dead.
[49:02.99]How much money did I just lose?
[49:09.51]That hurts.
[49:13.87]You know, I was gonna get a poster of Benjamin Franklin and put him up on this wall back here.
[49:18.87]Nah.
[49:19.56]Now...
[49:21.31]Now I'm gonna get a... ...poster of, uh... ...Dan Bush.
[49:27.73]Like, George Bush's, like, seventh cousin.
[49:31.91]Or, like, Bill Clinton.
[49:35.31]You know what?
[49:36.03]You know what?
[49:36.35]You know what?
[49:37.39]I think I'm gonna get a Bill Clinton poster.
[49:38.98]It's gonna go right there.
[49:41.50]There's gotta be... Is it, like, a Bill Clinton poster of him with, like, a cigar in his hand?
[49:44.82]It probably is.
[49:45.38]Like, him just, like, leaning back, like, smiling with his cigar.
[49:48.78]Benjamin fucking Franklin.
[49:52.77]Unbelievable.
[49:56.21]Well, we lost a bunch of money.
[49:59.96]That one was very, very, very, very hard.
[50:02.02]Is there a four or is it just threes and fives?
[50:09.70]Well, we'll do a three.
[50:16.13]We'll do a three.
[50:16.95]I'm not quite there yet to do the advanced level five ones.
[50:23.39]I don't think that tracer gun didn't shoot really fast enough for me.
[50:34.74]Oh, I got a new weapon.
[50:35.36]I got a chain gun, right?
[50:37.42]Let's try that one.
[50:41.78]You lost a hundred thousand burger boy snot booger fights.
[50:48.93]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[50:51.17]Bird voice, not booger fart.
[50:55.32]Ugh, that's great.
[51:01.28]Once spinning, they deliver a hurricane of withering fire.
[51:06.54]Let's try it.
[51:08.99]I still like this shotgun.
[51:10.57]The, uh... The trench gun.
[51:15.10]Do they make something else?
[51:16.56]I feel like something else could be here that I'm missing.
[51:22.46]Zip gun was a good choice too.
[51:24.00]We'll try the chain gun.
[51:24.78]Remember, this is a level 3, this is not a level 5.
[51:31.12]Keep these.
[51:33.54]I'm going to take another key.
[51:36.13]How much are the keys?
[51:36.79]Whatever.
[51:45.34]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[51:45.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[51:47.34]I'm gonna do 7 strength.
[51:52.32]That's a bad idea.
[51:56.54]Bad idea, but, you know, I'm gonna do it anyways.
[51:58.86]Let's see how it... Yeah!
[52:04.28]Yeah!
[52:07.58]Starts off slow.
[52:09.97]But then you get into face-melting category in like two seconds.
[52:13.46]I like it.
[52:13.98]We're staying with it.
[52:15.80]Oh, wrong way.
[52:22.31]This one, I didn't even look at it.
[52:23.59]That was pretty dumb.
[52:31.21]I'm gonna go in this door over here.
[52:34.30]Go in this door, grab the key.
[52:36.42]Make my way up.
[52:37.74]Try to destroy the shield and the alarm.
[52:40.58]Because that also requires a key to get in there.
[52:45.11]Get a couple of these tech upgrades.
[52:46.45]Go down, swing all the way down inside the puzzle piece into the core.
[52:50.95]Let's go.
[52:51.29]It's going to be a long trip to go all the way around.
[53:01.18]But it's worth it.
[53:01.66]At least I think.
[53:04.30]I hope.
[53:07.54]How many lines did I record for this game?
[53:09.10]Am I in the right spot?
[53:11.94]Hold on.
[53:16.16]No.
[53:16.50]I think like 40?
[53:19.22]50?
[53:19.24]30?
[53:20.96]Something like that.
[53:25.36]More than a handful, I would say.
[53:35.20]These things get kind of like unwieldy.
[53:41.62]Take the key.
[53:42.70]Let's go up.
[53:48.08]Another key.
[53:48.82]I don't even need to be bringing that many keys.
[53:51.60]I already have like three.
[53:53.88]Here we go.
[54:01.70]This is going to set off the alarm, isn't it?
[54:03.21]Like, jeez.
[54:04.87]Come on.
[54:08.49]Having the double-barreled shotgun shoot twice is going to kill me.
[54:11.37]Get in.
[54:34.21]Oh.
[54:35.05]Get in there.
[54:36.95]Get... Shit.
[54:38.89]Shit shit shit shit shit shit.
[54:40.65]Come on.
[54:41.03]I'm gonna have to hang out in here.
[54:45.31]Look at the mini-map.
[54:47.33]Holy fucking dog shit.
[54:48.29]Look at the mini-map.
[54:49.42]This is insane.
[54:52.46]They're all scrambling just to funnel into this one room.
[54:57.29]Is this like Hitman?
[54:58.73]Are they going to dissipate if I don't touch them for a while?
[55:03.13]Where's the repair drone?
[55:06.69]Oh no.
[55:08.99]Noooo.
[55:13.07]Forgot that this thing existed.
[55:21.23]Where is it?
[55:21.71]Is it this far down?
[55:25.19]It's that far down.
[55:26.31]I should have done this first.
[55:27.43]What bad planning.
[55:28.29]It's okay.
[55:34.24]How much time do I got?
[55:34.80]Three minutes?
[55:36.62]It's alright.
[55:38.52]I've just worked myself into it.
[56:01.83]Yo, you shithead, put your shield down.
[56:31.25]Can I not kill these things?
[56:38.63]I'm out of ammo.
[56:45.23]Oh no.
[56:46.55]Fuck.
[56:46.69]Oh no.
[57:08.01]Get these like snakes these little sperms get out of here I'm out of ammo on every gun
[57:34.18]Yeah, you called it.
[57:35.24]Not enough ammo.
[57:36.10]I heard it.
[57:36.58]I didn't.
[57:36.94]I didn't.
[57:37.40]I should've... I really like this game.
[57:45.27]This is really, really cool.
[57:54.68]Well, we've officially lost almost all the money that I have in my bank.
[58:01.25]Chain gun?
[58:02.67]I'm gonna have to go back to tried and true zip gun, man.
[58:06.57]Let's go to this one.
[58:08.61]And I got a couple other new things, but... Could do double zip gun.
[58:13.13]Let's try... You know what?
[58:13.71]We're gonna try it.
[58:14.19]We'll try double zip gun.
[58:18.12]I wonder if it's even possible.
[58:23.50]Yeah, see the... Look at how much money that is.
[58:25.46]No wonder it's that much money, because you can just spam it.
[58:29.08]Okay.
[58:30.62]Heavy machine gun piercing.
[58:37.14]High fire.
[58:38.42]That's a piercing ammunition auto-stabilizers.
[58:42.49]Hammering suit.
[58:43.43]So this slows you down a lot.
[58:46.75]Yeah, do we even need to read that?
[58:48.23]Or are we just getting two zip guns?
[58:51.26]You know what I mean?
[58:52.42]Do we really need to read any of that shit?
[58:54.82]That's what I...
[59:05.38]That's awesome.
[59:08.25]Oh, that's so cool.
[59:18.21]That's enough ammo too, I think.
[59:26.06]Alright.
[59:28.18]That is gonna be enough ammo.
[59:29.72]I hope.
[59:33.65]Don't need two keys.
[59:35.03]You get keys pretty easily.
[59:36.11]Sensor is okay to stay.
[59:39.87]I'll keep the one key, the one healer, and now we've got double zip guns, so the game's pretty much over, you know?
[59:44.80]Anybody thinks they're gonna get in our way now, they're insane.
[59:58.30]Now, let me think about this for a second, rather than just be a moron and say, oh, this is connected to this, and now I go.
[60:05.89]This is a repair system.
[60:09.43]This has to go.
[60:11.03]This thing has to go first.
[60:12.91]Otherwise, if I destroy this, it doesn't matter.
[60:16.33]Although, yeah, if I destroy this, it won't matter.
[60:18.21]Like, all those repair facilities, these things have to go.
[60:22.81]So there's one in here, there's only one.
[60:26.21]So we gotta go down, and then we gotta go all the way back up again.
[60:28.77]Up to here.
[60:29.63]Or even right over to here.
[60:32.71]So this is the point of entry.
[60:33.91]Actually, this is good because the turrets thing is right here.
[60:36.03]We got double zip gun.
[60:37.53]We're going in that spot right there to the lower right.
[60:40.35]Let's go.
[60:40.73]Oh shit, we're out of money.
[60:44.75]And that's where the game ends.
[60:56.25]Alright, I can't lose this one.
[60:57.83]I physically cannot lose this.
[60:59.53]Otherwise, the game's over.
[61:02.61]So, you know what they say.
[61:03.55]DOUBLE ZIP GUN!
[61:19.16]Move, move, move, move, move!
[61:23.86]I got places to be, places to be!
[61:26.83]I got a key, I can open this door, good.
[61:35.62]Fuck you!
[61:42.85]Alright!
[61:43.69]Keep moving!
[61:45.03]We have to, this is a must win.
[61:46.67]This is a must win situation.
[61:55.63]We're only gonna do one zip... one cricket.
[61:57.91]I keep forgetting about that.
[62:00.43]There's only like two assholes here.
[62:02.83]Don't wanna run out of ammo.
[62:03.61]I got plenty of time.
[62:07.78]Just chill.
[62:16.78]What's happening?
[62:17.40]What happened?
[62:17.72]Where'd I go?
[62:26.15]How do you not get hit by those beams?
[62:31.91]Let's move.
[62:33.88]I got, I got, I got like a thousand rounds.
[62:44.50]Fucking alarm.
[62:46.61]Blowing this whole thing.
[62:50.45]Like lagging.
[62:57.93]There's the brain.
[63:03.89]There's the shield.
[63:04.57]Alright, I gotta chill for a second.
[63:07.62]I'm running out of ammo.
[63:09.04]Do you guys see an ammo pod anywhere?
[63:18.18]I can't really look in the mini-map.
[63:33.78]Shit.
[63:36.40]This is gonna be so hard to hit this and not get hit.
[63:38.08]I'm gonna have to stand so close and just go like this.
[63:45.59]It's gonna reflect it right in my face.
[63:49.03]Ugh.
[64:04.04]Brain.
[64:05.26]I got a full minute and a half.
[64:14.76]Slow it down, slow it down.
[64:20.21]Eat shit.
[64:21.74]I'm down to one.
[64:23.60]I'm down to one zip gun.
[64:27.51]I can't even tell.
[64:28.29]I can't even tell.
[64:29.21]This stupid motherfucker right here.
[64:32.23]Do it!
[64:37.27]I did it!
[64:58.45]Oh, wow.
[64:59.70]I thought I lost it right at the end.
[65:02.12]We live another day.
[65:11.50]You know what?
[65:12.00]I bet you after a couple more seconds of that, it would have lost.
[65:14.74]I would have lost the game.
[65:19.52]Nice.
[65:21.80]Okay.
[65:23.27]Well, there's that.
[65:26.19]Double Zip Gun.
[65:27.15]All the way.
[65:27.87]It was all Double Zip Gun.
[65:32.23]Four Zip Gun?
[65:33.68]It's probably possible.
[65:34.60]I don't know if I have the money.
[65:42.72]Class 5.
[65:43.28]Class... We're up to 6 now.
[65:48.38]I don't think I'm gonna be able to beat that with the amount of money that I need to save.
[65:57.88]No, you know, multiple heals.
[66:00.50]A key.
[66:02.56]You know, let's try it.
[66:03.16]I'm gonna spend my entire bank account.
[66:12.75]This is a huge payout if I can beat this, though.
[66:20.69]If I can actually beat this, it's a pretty large payout.
[66:24.17]So, you know, we're just gonna...
[66:35.87]Can I do this?
[66:49.69]Alright, I was gonna say... This is really, really, really cool.
[67:07.30]This is great.
[67:10.30]Being able to do something like this, people can just do whatever the hell they want.
[67:13.82]To the detriment of your... We're doing four zip guns.
[67:20.89]I mean, you kind of have to.
[67:27.13]We're gonna do... Here's what we're gonna do.
[67:29.51]We're gonna do four zip guns.
[67:32.57]With as much ammo as I can put in them all.
[67:37.23]What about chain guns?
[67:38.03]Let's try that.
[67:40.51]I'm just curious to see how much more outrageous the chain guns are with four of them.
[67:43.81]My screen is lagging.
[67:52.78]I'm like dropping down to like 40 or 30 frames per second right now.
[68:06.64]That one's too dangerous because I can't even move.
[68:09.33]So we're not doing that.
[68:10.09]We're doing zip guns.
[68:12.35]Four zip guns and four heals.
[68:14.63]What's a knock?
[68:20.46]So this kind of blocks projectiles?
[68:27.32]Oh, I wasn't even firing the fourth one, was I?
[68:41.90]Let's just do it.
[68:42.86]Who cares?
[68:43.84]Let's do fucking five chain guns.
[68:47.08]Look at how much money this is.
[68:48.44]I'm not even gonna be able to afford it.
[68:51.40]How much money do I have?
[68:57.08]Total bang.
[68:57.80]Okay, I'm out of money.
[69:01.13]Let's go.
[69:02.45]You guys ready to lose the game?
[69:03.55]I'm about ready to lose the game.
[69:07.54]I'm out of money.
[69:08.26]Game over.
[69:09.52]I have to win this or it's game over.
[69:10.88]And I have four... I can't even control the character with WASD.
[69:17.43]I'm just gonna... There's no way.
[69:18.91]I can't do that.
[69:19.35]With WASD, F, I have my hand on my mouse, too.
[69:23.29]But, you know, with a little luck, we could just spam ourselves to victory.
[69:30.29]We'll take it easy at first.
[69:31.85]Those new hazards.
[69:33.31]Okay.
[69:33.41]Okay.
[69:39.53]Okay.
[69:47.34]Why is this working?
[69:51.46]Why is this working?
[69:53.66]It's like super no brain, what the hell is going on here?
[70:05.49]That's gonna take over this whole place ain't it?
[70:17.64]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be going.
[70:20.96]Oh, this is gonna reflect and kill me.
[70:25.12]I keep going this way.
[70:27.74]Let's get the brain.
[70:28.83]Give me the brain.
[70:30.65]Where's the brain?
[70:31.99]Where's the brain?
[70:34.11]Quick.
[70:35.97]Yeah.
[70:37.15]Destroy this.
[70:39.71]Dead.
[70:42.53]Where am I going?
[70:42.93]Where the hell is the brain?
[70:48.78]It's all the way over here.
[70:50.38]That, that's... I died.
[70:58.55]I died.
[70:58.87]I blew up.
[71:01.77]If I went the right way, it would have worked.
[71:06.67]I'm okay with just losing all my money and the game being over.
[71:10.57]Let's see what happens.
[71:12.73]Captain, you have exceeded the budget provided to you.
[71:16.15]This is in breach of our agreement.
[71:20.07]Uh-oh.
[71:20.97]Is this guy gonna kill me?
[71:24.17]Okay.
[71:28.43]It's fun being bankrupt, I guess.
[71:31.49]Out of funds, game over.
[71:33.07]Total score.
[71:40.40]Revenue.
[71:40.90]That's so cool.
[71:41.60]It gives you, like, a graph.
[71:44.12]Look at the kills near the end.
[71:48.54]You show that bank account, statement like that, to a guy on Wall Street, he'll probably throw up.
[71:58.96]That's, there it is.
[72:01.20]That's the game, Cryptarch.
[72:05.49]We give you a million dollars and you spent it all on chain guns?
[72:10.41]Why did we hire you in the first place?
[72:12.77]You're a fucking idiot.
[72:17.64]Alright, well, I'm gonna do another run.
[72:19.36]This time, I'm gonna... This one will be a little bit more legit.
[72:23.23]Because the first couple times, I had no idea what the hell I was doing.
[72:26.19]And then the last few were more kind of joking around and messing around with the loadouts.
[72:30.83]But this is Cryptarch.
[72:33.08]From what I just played, this, like, 40 minute session so far.
[72:36.62]This is really, really, really cool.
[72:38.98]Highly recommended so far.
[72:40.98]So, I'm gonna pee.
[72:43.30]I will be back in, like, two minutes.
[72:47.03]The first of many pisses, by the way.
[72:50.31]Like, if you didn't think there was going to be at least, like, four pisses this stream, I just really don't know what to tell you.
[72:55.93]I'll be right back.
[73:07.24]I'm going to go pee.
[73:46.06]Thank you.
[75:07.08]Hello.
[75:11.60]So what am I- can I get a new game, or can I just continue?
[75:15.72]Nah, that's from the previous one.
[75:18.94]So it's a new game, right?
[75:23.65]Yeah, wave 1, 10, yeah, okay.
[75:25.23]It's a new game.
[75:28.07]Slot 2.
[75:28.55]Hey, you know, we should probably look at the tutorial.
[75:39.18]Checklists are cleared, Pioneer spit-shined, and weapons free.
[75:42.88]I'll get the angle grinder out for when you get back.
[75:51.41]Two.
[75:52.85]So, like, right off the bat, I guess, let's give him... We'll go... You know, we're gonna go with two.
[75:57.11]This one seems pretty good.
[76:00.75]Let's actually try to beat this.
[76:10.20]I like the way the character looks.
[76:12.22]Look at his face.
[76:15.42]Looks like a shark.
[76:16.12]That, like, shark- red shark face.
[76:19.00]It's pretty damn cool.
[76:21.52]Let's conserve money.
[76:24.24]We'll go with the ramp spike.
[76:26.42]Don't need two of these at the first level.
[76:28.91]Might not even need one.
[76:30.03]I don't need the grenades.
[76:32.95]Can do two shields.
[76:34.53]No.
[76:37.52]Save money in the first few levels, for sure.
[76:40.14]I think that's pretty bare bones.
[76:49.09]That's fine.
[76:49.65]This shouldn't be that difficult.
[76:53.17]You know, I'll save even more money.
[76:54.41]I'll pick that down.
[76:55.67]Pick this down two.
[77:02.11]Okay.
[77:02.41]There's a repair that goes down first.
[77:04.19]Yeah, that has to go down first, because...
[77:21.40]The alarm system and the shield generator will both be repaired by the time I try to come back down.
[77:28.31]So we have to go, I guess, kind of just right in the front.
[77:30.47]This is a terrible entry point.
[77:34.21]How long do I have?
[77:34.87]Five minutes?
[77:36.63]Hold on, I have five minutes to go from here all the way down here, all the way up, and then all the way down again.
[77:46.56]Might just bypass the alarm.
[77:49.08]Come over here and get rid of the armoring system.
[77:51.38]Oh, this is a really tough generated level.
[77:54.42]I can come down here.
[78:01.67]But I still have to go up.
[78:04.37]You know what?
[78:04.79]We'll go there.
[78:05.37]Let's do it.
[78:05.67]$54,000.
[78:05.69]That's nothing.
[78:07.93]That's peanuts.
[78:20.46]I'm detecting a form of energized ablative armor protecting the drones on this ship.
[78:24.60]Knock out the armoring system and you should have... I know, I know, I know.
[78:27.87]Knock out the armoring system.
[78:28.87]Where am I going?
[78:30.51]Where am I?
[78:39.30]Fuck.
[78:40.42]Damn it.
[78:43.42]I thought it was like down to the left.
[78:45.18]It's right above me.
[78:46.34]I just lost like a full 20 seconds.
[78:50.87]This isn't even the right area to go in.
[78:52.61]No, I guess it is.
[78:53.23]I can go either way.
[79:00.04]Stinger Pod.
[79:00.76]Cool.
[79:09.31]Brain.
[79:20.07]Attack advanced!
[79:26.86]Heavy machine gun burst.
[79:30.52]I didn't even see what the hell just hit me.
[79:35.38]What the fuck just hit me?
[79:37.43]There's like these bomb things that are floating around.
[80:00.24]Eh, blocking my view.
[80:12.02]Alright, now we're going to go destroy the shield up here.
[80:17.24]Get another tech upgrade.
[80:20.06]I've got three minutes.
[80:20.74]I've got time.
[80:25.84]Wait a minute.
[80:29.59]I've got to go down because I can't go through.
[80:31.33]Yeah, I'll go down.
[80:32.65]Down and around.
[80:53.77]What's that?
[80:55.65]I've never seen this enemy yet.
[81:00.31]This thing takes a ton of hits.
[81:09.96]That enemy was actually pretty hard for some reason.
[81:26.89]Open up!
[81:34.92]Open your face, please!
[81:47.26]Is that... another shield up here?
[81:55.21]These enemies... I hate these enemies.
[81:58.27]Spinning Wheel of Death enemies are the worst.
[82:15.06]Get out of here.
[82:15.58]I don't want any of this.
[82:21.45]These little guys sneak up on you.
[82:22.61]They blend in with the environment pretty well.
[82:34.69]Brain?
[82:35.19]It's time to die.
[82:41.87]What the hell's going on?
[82:46.33]Did I not hurt it?
[82:47.31]The shield?
[82:49.30]Isn't the... Yeah, that's just the alarm system, huh?
[82:54.46]I can't hurt it?
[82:59.52]Huh.
[83:01.70]What's, uh, going on here?
[83:16.05]Huh.
[83:17.37]Does that protect this as well?
[83:19.98]I thought that was just an alarm.
[83:25.46]I guess not.
[83:26.82]Well.
[83:28.68]Alrighty then.
[83:38.31]I can't go around this either.
[83:39.41]This is, uh... I'm just trying to look.
[83:43.71]Yeah, I can't hit the glowing side.
[83:47.05]I guess, uh... Okay.
[83:53.74]Yeah, there was no way to go around.
[83:57.58]Was that just, like, locked in there?
[83:58.82]That side was locked in.
[84:02.10]Unless I, like, went through.
[84:03.12]That was weird.
[84:09.37]Yeah, I don't think there was any... There was no way for me to go to the other side of that brain.
[84:14.53]I think I may have just gotten procedurally generated screwed.
[84:19.85]Because if I had to go all the way around, I only had like 30 seconds.
[84:31.98]Damn it!
[84:35.62]Uh, okay.
[84:40.38]You'd have to go around the whole ship.
[84:41.62]I only had like 45 seconds.
[84:45.15]Whatever.
[84:45.41]I could, uh... I could be upset, or I could, you know, just get myself going.
[84:52.94]Do it again.
[85:03.39]Well, I'm not happy that I just blew that money.
[85:08.53]I don't like this bike.
[85:13.85]That one seems kind of cool, but let's look at the... Cluster grenades.
[85:19.37]Stinger pod.
[85:31.51]No, I wanted that.
[85:32.49]Here.
[85:34.47]Actually, I don't think I need that many.
[85:41.38]I'll try these for fun.
[85:44.89]Stinger missiles.
[85:46.76]Not that many.
[85:55.34]This is new.
[86:02.83]That seems pretty damn cool.
[86:04.21]You can teleport to it.
[86:10.46]I like that.
[86:11.14]I kind of want to try it.
[86:15.85]Let's take a look.
[86:22.14]So there are two places to go to the brain.
[86:24.20]Shield.
[86:32.99]If I go in this way, I can destroy the shield here.
[86:35.39]I don't think there's a reason to destroy the door lock.
[86:43.91]Don't really need to care about the alarm here.
[86:46.64]Just bang.
[86:47.32]Around here.
[86:51.32]There is a repair station there.
[86:53.16]And then I come up.
[86:56.22]Get rid of that.
[86:59.03]If I can destroy this and then come around quickly enough to destroy this... It's risky.
[87:07.85]But I think I might try it.
[87:14.47]I'm going to try that.
[87:16.25]I should be able to go from here to there in less than a minute or two, right?
[87:20.43]Worst comes to worst, I just have to go back around.
[87:23.26]I'm going to go straight down to the top.
[87:27.50]Let's go.
[87:30.16]So I've got to go from here.
[87:32.16]That's actually a pretty long way to go.
[87:33.68]I've got to go all the way around the ship.
[87:43.86]Yeah, the teleporter can go down.
[87:56.09]I'm going to put the teleporter right up here.
[88:04.95]Is it set?
[88:06.54]Did I?
[88:07.46]Oh, God.
[88:09.22]Okay, so you just hit two, and then you hit two again.
[88:12.56]What the fuck?
[88:14.61]Oh, back to the original plan.
[88:17.87]Oh my god, what a fucking disaster this one is.
[88:22.23]This one is a total fucking disaster, because I was too busy figuring out how the teleporter worked.
[88:31.58]I thought it was going to, like, shoot out of the device.
[88:44.52]No, I guess it just remembers where you are at the time?
[88:48.98]What the fuck?
[88:53.99]I can do this in time, for sure.
[89:15.17]They're kind of cool, but they're a little slow. 16,000!
[89:47.38]Wish I had the teleport now.
[89:56.48]Really wish I had the teleport.
[90:03.61]DEAL!
[90:10.29]Running ammo.
[90:20.15]Get rid of it!
[90:48.36]Running out of ammo.
[90:53.54]Oh my goodness, I'm getting knocked all over the place.
[91:02.97]I got it.
[91:04.87]Well, that could have been a walk later.
[91:06.21]I'm so upset right now.
[91:09.65]Good work.
[91:19.61]I wonder how much money I'm not going to get for getting... Actually, uh, yeah.
[91:22.39]Well, no, I took the health.
[91:23.53]Which I absolutely needed to do, otherwise I would have lost.
[91:26.37]Loadout max 100k.
[91:27.23]Does that mean that I spent more than $100,000 to be able to do that mission?
[91:30.30]Apparently.
[91:50.36]Is there a story in this game?
[91:51.70]Um... I think it's pretty open-ended.
[91:54.18]You're, like, a crew that's doing these, like, salvaging missions for this weird snake person company.
[92:02.26]I don't know, like, all the lore.
[92:03.86]I don't think there's very much.
[92:05.00]I mean, this is... Remember, this is... This game is early access.
[92:09.51]Just remember that.
[92:10.25]That's kind of... This is a very, very complete feeling game for it being early access.
[92:19.03]Okay.
[92:19.15]Okay.
[92:21.79]Do I just play... I might just play it safe here and do one of the ones.
[92:25.59]I need to do something simple to not... Because that first one really did.
[92:29.09]I just got screwed.
[92:30.43]I'll do the two.
[92:35.04]Tech advances six.
[92:36.48]One health station.
[92:37.62]Let's just do two.
[92:39.10]I want to try to get to the end.
[92:43.46]One is too easy.
[92:44.70]Two is like okay.
[92:45.88]Three is like a little bit more difficult.
[92:53.51]Small two, that's good.
[92:57.45]Alarm down there.
[93:01.19]No supply pods, and the loadout needs to be more than 60k.
[93:05.59]I could probably get all three.
[93:08.32]I'm gonna go for all three bonuses, which shouldn't be that hard.
[93:11.82]Considering I can just walk right in this door.
[93:14.44]Two tech pods.
[93:16.82]There's the shield.
[93:18.40]Go in with the key, destroy the brain.
[93:21.07]Pretty self-explanatory.
[93:23.61]Terry.
[93:26.44]So bang, bang.
[93:28.20]There's a key, right?
[93:28.86]Oh yeah, this is cake.
[93:30.30]I just need to spend 60 grand.
[93:34.50]How much is the loadout worth right now?
[93:35.66]79?
[93:36.44]Get rid of these.
[93:39.30]I wasn't a fan of those.
[93:47.33]Mmm.
[93:49.17]I don't need this.
[93:53.32]60k, right?
[93:54.91]Okay.
[93:56.79]I think that's good to go.
[94:02.75]Oh, the max... Okay, I get it.
[94:04.59]I get it.
[94:04.93]So I'm just gonna go in with nothing at all.
[94:19.03]Maybe a little bit more ammo with the zip gun?
[94:23.34]That'll do it.
[94:26.20]That'll do it!
[94:28.32]Alright guys, let's do it.
[94:29.48]Right in the front door.
[94:30.66]Should be easy.
[94:40.13]Two tech upgrades right off the bat.
[94:50.21]I need to have 6 health.
[94:57.64]I thought that was an enemy.
[94:58.68]Gotta watch out for the alarm.
[95:04.63]Although it's going to be hard to shoot through here.
[95:07.18]I knew that was going to happen.
[95:09.52]That's why I needed to get close.
[95:18.91]Not bad.
[95:22.17]These are the worst ones.
[95:24.01]I hate those ones.
[95:48.36]Fuck off.
[95:49.60]Whoa, that was lag.
[95:51.24]That was lag.
[95:54.76]Oh my god, my game is lagging.
[96:00.36]Okay, well that didn't really go as planned.
[96:13.33]The shield's recharging!
[96:14.11]The shield's recharging!
[96:14.77]Get rid of it!
[96:15.97]Thank god.
[96:21.63]Bye bye.
[96:23.57]I didn't get the first bonus, but whatever.
[96:27.42]When in doubt, blame lag.
[96:28.90]Well, no, lag's not the right word.
[96:30.91]Like, hardware lag.
[96:32.83]Like, and everything, like, you know, your computer freezes for like a second.
[96:38.05]Not like internet lag.
[96:46.31]Grenades don't reflect like bullets, they're shield killers, basically.
[96:49.30]Ah, okay, that's good to know.
[96:52.04]I just wish I could rebind the button to be something on my mouse.
[97:01.37]I got at least the two bonuses.
[97:04.83]I got plenty of money now.
[97:05.61]Even more stuff to worry about?
[97:10.06]Great.
[97:26.35]Two fives or two threes.
[97:28.03]This one is the more expensive three.
[97:30.87]I'm gonna do that one.
[97:39.59]I have a lot of money.
[97:46.29]I'm going to get a little bit more health because I have more money.
[97:51.68]I know that loadout max 60k is a thing, but I would like to complete this game.
[97:56.26]At least, you know, do a run of this game, I guess.
[98:00.42]Drone factories.
[98:01.10]How many drone factories are there?
[98:08.07]I'll keep this except... What's this one?
[98:10.83]EMP shotgun.
[98:14.99]Ooh.
[98:17.59]Let's try that.
[98:24.81]I'll get him.
[98:25.33]It's just hard to use.
[98:26.49]I just... Hitting F is awkward for me.
[98:35.00]Good to know.
[98:36.00]F. I want that to be mouse 4.
[98:58.54]Now, it should still be Mouse 4, right?
[99:01.62]Mouse 4.
[99:09.38]Damn it.
[99:13.29]That's too bad.
[99:13.95]Because it's not F now, it's not... Oh well.
[99:21.27]Can I make it Mouse... No, I can't do Mouse 5.
[99:33.90]Something that's less... F is really the only thing.
[99:37.54]I guess it's... I guess.
[99:40.50]Shift.
[99:41.08]Maybe shift.
[99:41.76]Yeah, actually shift is probably better.
[99:45.57]Then that takes away that.
[99:46.71]I'll do this as... Alt, maybe?
[99:50.15]Yeah.
[99:51.87]Let's see if that's better.
[99:57.86]Yeah, that's better.
[99:59.54]Not ideal, but...
[100:05.68]So this is an EMP shotgun, which disables electronics.
[100:09.08]So I'm assuming I can go bang, they shut down for a second, and I can sap them and destroy them.
[100:15.57]Alright, let's take a look at this area.
[100:25.54]Tons of these repair systems.
[100:30.46]Too many of them, one might say.
[100:37.03]I think I'm going to get rid of the alarm system this time.
[100:38.85]I'm going to start with the alarm system.
[100:40.53]I'm going right in here and destroying the alarm system.
[100:42.59]That really does just kill you every time.
[100:46.07]When you trip that, you're going to lose like 4 HP to some of the sheer amount of people that are running around.
[100:59.18]I mean, you can do twin stick.
[101:00.62]I mean, you're talking about mouse control.
[101:02.50]I believe you can... There's a gamepad mode.
[101:06.07]It probably works okay.
[101:07.41]It's kind of like Geometry Wars.
[101:09.75]Unlike the Xbox.
[101:11.51]Alright.
[101:12.81]Course of action.
[101:13.67]In here.
[101:14.81]No, I can't do that because of the repair stations.
[101:20.41]Well, these are the only two repair stations.
[101:23.53]One, two.
[101:25.24]Get rid of those.
[101:30.13]Okay, here's the plan.
[101:31.93]I'm gonna get rid of both of these through here.
[101:34.27]I'm gonna bring a key with me.
[101:37.49]And then I'm gonna go down here.
[101:39.81]I'm gonna place the teleporter right there.
[101:41.77]Okay.
[101:44.43]Teleporter goes there.
[101:47.27]Then we go over here, take out the alarm, teleport, take out the shield, and then make our way up and around.
[101:54.89]Actually, yeah.
[101:56.51]Up and around to the core.
[101:58.97]okay so that means I need a couple things I need a key and I need a teleport okay and I start here which means I have to go up around this way through here let's give it a go how much ammo do I have enough
[102:28.49]That was a lot of money.
[102:37.95]Yeah, I personally wouldn't be able to play this game on anything but a mouse.
[102:42.38]Although, like, twin stick shooters usually, they're pretty, they're okay.
[102:45.78]They're not terrible.
[102:47.88]Because it's just that your right thumb is doing the same thing, right?
[103:02.95]Those are the spin guys.
[103:34.89]Is that thing breaking in here?
[103:38.29]Those things can't hurt you, by the way.
[103:40.01]I just realized that.
[103:42.65]Those cannot hurt you.
[103:43.57]I guess they can, can't they?
[103:53.48]Oh, God.
[103:54.00]It's being repaired by the other one, isn't it?
[104:00.98]Oh, so much ammo.
[104:05.75]He's been lost.
[104:12.59]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[104:16.91]Okay, they both hit.
[104:27.64]Let's go back around.
[104:36.02]Whoo!
[104:38.50]Fun.
[104:40.48]What the fuck?
[104:47.71]I need a... I'm going to need an ammo station here.
[104:51.41]For sure.
[104:58.27]Got a key, right?
[104:59.05]I'm going to need to go in there, though.
[105:10.68]Alright, let's put down... There's the teleporter.
[105:17.32]Well, I have a second here.
[105:20.55]Looking for an ammo station.
[105:23.93]Down here.
[105:25.17]Okay.
[105:26.07]Where am I right now?
[105:27.39]That's far.
[105:31.96]Going to the right is too far to go.
[105:34.16]I'm gonna have to just do it.
[105:35.46]I'm gonna have to just bite the bullet and go down.
[105:39.66]To the left and down.
[105:40.67]I can even take out that while I'm down there.
[105:44.31]Okay, let's go.
[105:56.19]If I don't have to attack anybody, I won't.
[106:02.35]Fucking hate those enemies!
[106:05.93]These guys have put up the shields.
[106:09.07]The thing doesn't repair... Holy dog shit.
[106:11.81]There's so many things flying around the goddamn screen.
[106:20.83]Ugh.
[106:40.61]Quick, Left 4 Dead.
[106:42.43]Come on.
[106:43.97]Come on, Left 4 Dead.
[106:45.39]Bring me back.
[106:46.67]Bring me back.
[106:49.75]I'm back.
[106:53.62]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[106:55.86]Yes, I will.
[106:56.82]That was a lot of money.
[106:57.80]That was a huge amount of money.
[107:06.93]I don't have time for this.
[107:18.66]I'm blowing through so much money.
[107:21.08]It's crazy.
[107:27.39]What?!
[107:28.53]You fucker!
[107:30.97]That's game over.
[107:31.53]We're gonna go teleport.
[107:34.88]See you later.
[107:35.30]I triggered the alarm, but guess what?
[107:37.61]Didn't even matter.
[107:40.31]What the hell is shooting me from across the map?
[107:45.83]Should've got Grenade.
[107:48.32]Should've got grenades.
[107:49.02]No, that's not the right way.
[108:15.70]60 seconds.
[108:17.56]60 seconds.
[108:18.06]Cross your fingers.
[108:21.80]Oh, I don't think so.
[108:25.08]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[108:26.58]It's gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle if I can do this.
[108:34.69]Dude, there's so many people.
[108:36.37]Oh my god, I have to kite them this way.
[108:45.32]Jesus!
[108:47.00]No way!
[108:47.54]No way!
[108:47.88]Game over!
[108:49.62]I can't- I'm not gonna Left 4 Dead my way out of this one.
[108:52.70]No way!
[108:53.30]Holy shit!
[109:00.83]Fuck!
[109:09.15]The EMP?
[109:09.91]The EMP was the shotgun that I had.
[109:20.49]It's okay, I still got money.
[109:25.39]I still got cash.
[109:30.29]Oh my god, it's because I bound it to shift.
[109:34.37]That was, oh my god.
[109:36.42]You see, if I could just put my fucking key binding on the thing I wanted, I wouldn't have forgotten that I had bombs.
[109:40.84]Because I pressed F. And I was like, I don't have bombs.
[109:44.52]Of course I don't.
[109:45.32]No, it's because I had it on fucking shift.
[109:52.19]It should be on this button.
[109:58.32]I don't think it would have mattered though, honestly.
[110:00.70]I'm pretty sure I still was gonna lose that.
[110:12.12]Fuck.
[110:17.21]What a crock of shit.
[110:25.23]Oh, spam salt!
[110:26.33]Spam the salt emote!
[110:27.43]This stream is getting fucking salty!
[110:36.85]Now, you know, it's just, I... I just didn't think I had them for some reason, because I just rebound the key.
[110:44.76]And... I, like, forgot that the key was bound there.
[110:48.46]That was the problem.
[110:50.08]Won't forget this time.
[110:58.06]For the love of God.
[110:59.00]I actually don't like this shotgun either.
[111:01.71]What is this?
[111:11.69]What does it do?
[111:30.02]I don't know what it does.
[111:30.68]You can also cook the grenades, too.
[111:43.94]I guess we're gonna have to find out.
[111:49.79]Slime Mortar Cannons.
[111:52.01]Maybe it slows them down, I'm assuming?
[111:59.68]Cool looking.
[112:04.35]Alright.
[112:05.99]I think it's time to buy more ammo for the zip gun.
[112:15.14]Another expensive trip.
[112:21.89]Juggernaut factory.
[112:32.38]Okay.
[112:35.67]It's our own factory.
[112:38.47]It's another one of these spread out ones.
[112:42.11]The brain is here.
[112:47.69]This dream is making me dehydrated.
[112:49.17]Go get- go drink some water!
[112:52.94]Go drink a Gatorade.
[112:53.66]What, are you crazy?
[113:00.60]I don't know about this one, this one's really spread out.
[113:13.76]Technically I can just go in there.
[113:15.12]And even if the alarm does sound, let's say I just go in here, destroy that.
[113:22.58]And come right back in here.
[113:24.24]Even if the alarm sounds, where are they gonna come from?
[113:26.70]They're gonna have to come a long way.
[113:33.71]Because that's a very far way to go.
[113:35.43]I'm going to try that.
[113:37.08]I've got my goo gun.
[113:37.90]I can try that.
[113:38.86]We'll do it.
[113:40.32]So where's the ship?
[113:41.34]So I've got to go up.
[113:43.78]And in there.
[113:48.08]I can also put a... Yeah!
[113:50.53]Let's do this.
[113:52.81]I'll go in here first.
[113:54.57]I'm going to... No, that's probably a bad idea.
[113:57.03]I was going to say put a teleporter in here, but I'm going to trip the alarm and that'll just screw me.
[114:06.32]We're gonna get rid of the teleporter, huh?
[114:07.90]I don't want to use it.
[114:19.11]Whoa!
[114:20.03]Can you guys hear that?
[114:20.69]Holy shit!
[114:24.63]Hold on.
[114:29.89]Wow!
[114:31.79]Those are coyotes.
[114:36.29]What the fuck is going on out here?
[114:37.86]I don't know if you guys could hear that.
[114:47.88]Those are coyotes, man.
[114:53.23]I'm just looking out the window trying to see.
[114:57.33]My dog just jumped up.
[114:58.35]He's like, what the hell is out there?
[115:06.73]That was right... I've heard them before, I've heard coyotes before, down here, but... Oh my god, that was like right outside my window.
[115:19.10]Alright.
[115:19.93]Well, you got to hear the coyotes, that's cool.
[115:28.19]Well, if those aren't coyotes, I don't know what they would be, considering there's no... there's no dogs over there.
[115:35.70]That is, uh, that is woods.
[115:40.24]Alright, we're back to reality here.
[115:49.59]Alright.
[115:50.69]Let's go.
[115:51.13]I'm gonna stick with the plan.
[115:55.25]So expensive.
[115:56.47]So expensive.
[116:00.02]Plan is go all the way up and just go and just shoot the goo everywhere.
[116:04.08]Such a stupid plan.
[116:05.06]What an awful idea.
[116:09.03]I wish I was better at, like, playing difficult video games.
[116:16.15]Because I could have, like, planned that out.
[116:17.61]Like, oh, it's going to go here.
[116:18.64]Teleporter's going to go over there.
[116:22.90]Oh, that's not a place to go.
[116:26.51]Let's see what it does.
[116:29.95]Let's see what it does.
[116:34.51]Entirely sure.
[116:43.83]Flamethrower.
[116:44.59]Now that's what I want to see.
[116:49.17]Get out of here.
[116:51.12]worst enemy in game.
[117:01.95]Health, I don't need it at the moment.
[117:06.33]Wait a second.
[117:11.15]Oh, shit in my pants.
[117:16.22]Come on now.
[117:23.10]Wonderful.
[117:29.64]Remember how I said I don't want to use grenades?
[117:31.68]What a dumb mistake that was.
[117:35.47]Because they're unbelievable!
[118:00.05]Oh, come on!
[118:03.11]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[118:08.56]Guys are just like swimming out here.
[118:12.44]How far away is it?
[118:13.24]Right there, straight up.
[118:14.96]Take the heal.
[118:16.64]Let's blow this thing to hell.
[118:25.28]Oh, that lagged.
[118:35.41]Very quick.
[118:36.41]Very quick indeed.
[118:37.87]My apprentices.
[118:46.08]Look at that bonus.
[118:48.28]Look at that bonus for beating that in that amount of time.
[118:55.47]I think we made back a couple of our awful mistakes that I made.
[119:02.09]I would say so.
[119:07.27]Now this is where I lost last time.
[119:10.85]So for the purposes of me trying not to lose again, I'm not... Last time I did a six and did all chain guns.
[119:17.24]This time we're gonna stay with the baby three so I can try to get to the end of this game.
[119:22.96]And I might not even get to the end of the game.
[119:45.41]That's too expensive.
[119:49.83]I think, are we... You do like a melee-only build, that's pretty awesome.
[119:55.91]Where's the flamethrower?
[120:01.30]Flame.
[120:02.34]Simple but undeniably potent in tight spaces, this brutish weapon sprays pressurized gouts of highly flammable liquid.
[120:10.58]We're gonna need a lot more than that.
[120:15.18]I would say we're gonna need, like, that.
[120:16.90]And, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay try- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[120:20.96]No.
[120:23.02]I- The slime mortar, I don't- Slime mortar, I don't- Eh, eh, eh, you know.
[120:28.57]Not really- Wasn't really feeling it.
[120:31.13]So we're gonna have a backup here.
[120:33.35]Backup.
[120:34.79]Zip gun.
[120:38.85]Maximum 100,000?
[120:39.47]What am I at right now?
[120:45.39]It's almost double 100,000, in fact.
[120:49.98]Alright, we got our $200,000 loadout, just in case the flamethrower sucks.
[120:58.12]We're gonna try it.
[121:02.02]Flamethrowers always seem to be amazing or terrible.
[121:04.56]That's very true.
[121:06.18]Let's hope it is the former.
[121:12.19]Let's take a look.
[121:15.95]That's not really even a flamethrower, man.
[121:17.51]That's like a... I guess it is.
[121:19.77]A plasma gun.
[121:22.15]That's very, very dangerous.
[121:26.26]One problem I see with this weapon, it's very blinding.
[121:30.04]It's going to be hard for me to see incoming projectiles.
[121:35.04]But we'll give it a go.
[121:44.20]Another two repair.
[121:45.36]Ah, this one sucks.
[121:48.44]Again, we can go for speed.
[121:50.95]Two repairs.
[121:52.15]Wrap around right to the shield.
[121:53.29]There's a couple of tech on the way.
[121:58.45]How does this core surround?
[121:59.75]Let me see this core.
[122:02.17]There's one tiny little slot to get into this core room.
[122:08.88]That's it.
[122:12.08]It's right in the corner here.
[122:16.02]That's a really awkward spot.
[122:25.12]I don't know.
[122:25.80]We'll find out.
[122:26.56]Maybe it can reflect it.
[122:27.78]We'll see.
[122:31.16]So up here, and then if I go down through here and there.
[122:40.98]I actually might have enough time to take the alarm out and save myself a little bit of potential embarrassment.
[122:48.34]But, you know, we're using the flamethrower.
[122:50.64]I've never used it before.
[122:51.80]Probably a bad idea, but it's too late.
[122:53.40]I just dropped $200,000.
[122:54.52]Let's go ahead and go right.
[122:57.21]I have the key for this purpose.
[123:01.43]Let's go right in.
[123:02.27]No, I don't have the key.
[123:02.87]I don't have the key.
[123:06.65]I'd say I'm going to... Yeah, we're going down.
[123:09.75]We'll go down this way.
[123:14.51]Alright, boys and girls.
[123:20.33]Flamethrower time.
[123:23.83]Let's turn on flames.
[123:30.63]I knew it, I knew it was gonna blind me, but it's very, very powerful.
[123:36.92]In fact, it's so powerful, it's still making the noise like I'm shooting it when I'm not.
[123:54.80]Oh, what is hitting me from above here?
[123:57.12]God.
[123:59.38]I don't like it.
[124:00.22]Don't like it.
[124:02.20]I don't like it.
[124:03.55]It's too hard to see.
[124:07.23]Oh, boy.
[124:08.41]That's okay.
[124:09.03]This is still doable.
[124:16.36]Oh.
[124:21.52]Oh.
[124:45.96]So I kind of can't reflect it.
[124:47.54]Yes, it can.
[124:49.22]No, I can absolutely reflect it.
[125:00.46]A laser?
[125:00.92]I like the sound of that.
[125:01.80]Alright, come on.
[125:04.18]Right when I hit tab... I got plenty of time.
[125:07.32]Let's just take it slow.
[125:14.22]Hey, get slow.
[125:18.25]I got a full six right now.
[125:26.69]Oh my god.
[125:31.35]Get surrounded down.
[125:44.53]They must be so hot.
[125:50.15]Ah!
[126:15.29]Oh my lord, those things do so much damage.
[126:18.41]And they're so hard to kill.
[126:22.66]I'm surprised I didn't get my leg back.
[126:25.30]Alright, we need to see.
[126:30.08]Okay, straight up.
[126:30.92]Straight up.
[126:31.90]Literally straight up.
[126:38.73]See you later.
[126:42.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[126:43.05]Don't go that way.
[126:52.59]Let's do this right.
[126:54.41]Let's do it right.
[127:19.23]Oh, come on.
[127:20.95]Come on.
[127:22.47]Really?
[127:22.83]No way.
[127:24.17]Fuck.
[127:30.29]This ain't happening.
[127:32.05]Damn.
[127:33.15]I actually might get a life here.
[127:37.11]There's so many enemies here to life or death.
[127:41.63]Yeah, I got it, but I immediately died.
[127:43.19]Oh, God.
[127:49.16]Yeah, flamethrower.
[127:51.09]I think flamethrower kind of stuck a fork in that one, unfortunately.
[127:58.25]Am I out of money?
[128:00.05]No, I still have a little bit of money.
[128:03.99]Flamethrower too short and blinds you.
[128:07.55]Unfortunately.
[128:12.17]Phew.
[128:17.87]I'll try this one.
[128:22.22]This game seems tough.
[128:23.22]It is very tough.
[128:31.56]But it's very fun.
[128:33.14]It's very fun.
[128:35.20]I gotta try to salvage as much money as I can.
[128:40.21]Whoa.
[128:42.37]And by salvage money, I mean the game crashed.
[128:47.13]No, what?
[128:52.27]Yeah, I don't know how this is still audio playing.
[129:00.23]I'm not sure how this is still audio playing.
[129:03.63]The game crashed.
[129:07.57]That's too bad.
[129:11.39]So where is it?
[129:11.90]It's not on my taskbar.
[129:20.55]Sounds like it's on the menu screen.
[129:22.63]Uh... Uh-oh.
[129:32.30]Cryptarch.
[129:32.80]It's apparently still running.
[129:35.20]But where that's running, I'm not entirely sure.
[129:42.65]Well, there's that.
[129:43.91]Okay.
[129:44.29]Well, we can just start it again.
[129:52.13]Hold on a second.
[130:01.54]I probably could have salvaged that too.
[130:03.68]Unfortunately.
[130:07.14]I'll try.
[130:07.38]I'll give it one more go.
[130:08.52]I'm going to give it one more start to finish try to run through it.
[130:13.70]I may or may not get to the last couple of places.
[130:15.68]This is a very, very hard game.
[130:17.40]But that's good.
[130:19.44]That's like a good thing.
[130:26.33]That should do it.
[130:27.45]Here we are.
[130:29.07]Can I continue?
[130:31.61]Wait for... I think so, right?
[130:34.88]Yeah, this is the same.
[130:36.02]No, okay, we can keep going.
[130:37.66]I guess it just crashed out.
[130:38.68]It's saved, though.
[130:52.41]There was a tutorial.
[130:53.41]It was a pretty short one.
[130:55.68]This is a very dark level.
[130:59.02]I might have to rethink my entire strategy.
[131:02.26]Going quick and trying to blow through.
[131:04.20]I just get so scared of the time.
[131:10.47]But I can't afford anything.
[131:14.77]I have $133,000.
[131:15.01]Highly recommend this though, guys.
[131:24.52]Honestly, this is one of the more fun games in this category that I've played since Binding of Isaac.
[131:33.49]There's a lot of different loadout options, there's a lot of very, very difficult things in the game.
[131:43.23]I don't understand what this is.
[131:48.11]Does that mean it cuts through doors?
[131:54.63]I don't know what that means.
[131:55.65]See, the problem with playing through one of these games for the first time and trying to figure out... Like that last run, me using the flamethrower, I blew $100,000 and lost the mission.
[132:05.26]Because I had to figure out that I didn't like it.
[132:08.24]But that's why it's cool.
[132:10.66]Because you're going to play with all these items and all these things and you're going to lose a shitload of times.
[132:15.54]But then you're going to find the thing that you like and you'll do all your runs like that.
[132:20.81]Oh no, what's the matter?
[132:22.35]What are you doing?
[132:24.19]What are you doing?
[132:25.23]Chew that bone.
[132:27.01]He's looking at me and he's making like a... Saw.
[132:34.78]I just saw a saw arm.
[132:38.87]Why do I feel like, okay, like, I'm gonna make, like, a Star comment.
[132:41.86]Like, you know, like, the relatable gamer Star.
[132:45.04]I feel like if Star played this game, he would just do all melee.
[132:48.12]And he would, like, beat the game in, like, 20 minutes and be like, oh, I didn't all melee run.
[132:51.84]And he'd show me.
[132:54.12]And I'd be like, oh, cool.
[132:55.81]Whatever, dude.
[132:58.33]Why does, like, melee get- I feel like melee guy is something that, like, Star would do.
[133:03.77]If you're watching right now, Star.
[133:04.65]Star.
[133:06.89]Do it.
[133:08.09]Let's see it, you know?
[133:09.43]Let's see it!
[133:09.91]I don't know, maybe I think I'm gonna change up my whole... my whole scheme here.
[133:21.36]I can't do that.
[133:34.35]I don't have enough money.
[133:41.55]Well, I'm absolutely not going to beat this one because I have no money.
[133:44.61]132 with a key.
[133:47.55]I want to do the double spread shotgun.
[133:49.63]Okay.
[134:08.91]Okay, let's try it.
[134:10.29]I got nothing to lose really at this point.
[134:13.65]Let's just see how that works.
[134:20.33]That's a lot of recoil.
[134:21.51]I'm like flying too far back.
[134:23.02]I think that's gonna screw with me.
[134:24.06]Have to do the double spread.
[134:32.68]Dangerous though.
[134:39.21]I can spread them out.
[134:39.75]I don't have to do them at the same time.
[134:42.71]And that's probably not enough ammo.
[134:48.09]I need way more ammo than that.
[134:49.30]Yeah, that's not going to work.
[134:50.16]Great.
[134:51.38]Now I'm definitely going to lose.
[134:53.16]Though I am absolutely losing this one.
[135:08.05]You guys want to see the end of this run?
[135:09.35]It's gonna happen right now.
[135:10.85]You know, what's even in there?
[135:15.05]What is even in here?
[135:15.97]Shield.
[135:19.00]Jammer.
[135:20.42]Cool.
[135:20.98]Kool-Aid jammer.
[135:25.90]Let's go.
[135:29.06]Get this shit going.
[135:37.98]Where's the shield up there?
[135:38.86]Go.
[135:38.92]I don't even care.
[135:50.14]I don't even care.
[135:53.76]I don't care.
[135:54.62]I don't give a shit.
[135:55.20]Let's go.
[136:18.61]Leave the ammo.
[136:20.49]I don't even need it.
[136:24.27]Can't fit down the little butt crack?
[136:25.33]What the hell?
[136:43.11]What?!
[136:44.09]No way!
[136:44.85]No way!
[136:46.65]That was dog shit.
[136:47.99]I got like stuck in the corner over there.
[137:03.20]Oh my god, I can't keep up.
[137:04.50]There's nowhere to go.
[137:09.95]Let's do it!
[137:10.59]Move!
[137:13.44]Where's the core?
[137:15.02]Right down here.
[137:21.27]Look at that technology.
[137:25.29]I ain't even messing around right now.
[137:28.77]I'm here for one purpose.
[137:29.83]Destroy the brain.
[137:32.70]I don't give a... Just... Just die!
[137:45.75]Huh?

[139:23.38]Ooh!
[139:23.58]Blow it up!
[139:23.96]Blow it up!
[139:24.38]Do it!
[139:33.30]What did the explosion... Did the explosion kill me?
[139:36.10]What?
[139:36.26]I just...
[140:00.09]The banana waves killed you.
[140:02.55]Alright, time for a fucking dog camp.
[140:06.23]That's it.
[140:07.03]You know what?
[140:12.27]Time for a fucking dog cam.
[140:14.50]You know, when life's got you down and you're getting your ass kicked in a video game, you know what?
[140:23.01]It's just time for a fucking dog cam.
[140:41.64]He's licking his ass.
[140:42.72]Hey, hey.
[140:45.10]Hey.
[140:47.01]You're on dog cam.
[140:48.05]Don't you know that, buddy?
[140:56.35]Hey, Otto.
