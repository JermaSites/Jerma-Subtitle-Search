[00:01.44]You know, when I come in this room here, and I go over to the chat, and I'm still just kind of preparing, walk in here with a coffee, granola bar, and naked, and I see that the webcam's light is on, and I look in the chat, and I see, shh, we can hear him.
[00:19.12]I can hear him.
[00:21.72]I think that's the most panic-inducing thing for any live streamer, is that I pressed, I turned the button on somehow, like I pressed it or I clicked it and I just didn't realize it, and I'm just broadcasting live, just me being weird.
[00:41.30]Like, I'm not concerned about, like, the quote, hot mic, right?
[00:45.78]Like a hot mic.
[00:46.72]He's saying something bad.
[00:48.32]No, no, no.
[00:49.60]I'm concerned about the pre-hot mic.
[00:52.89]Like the pre.
[00:54.73]Like the thing is not even on yet.
[00:57.03]And I'm walking around naked.
[01:02.81]Pre-hot mic.
[01:11.00]Yeah, because screencap.
[01:14.27]At the age of the screencap, if something happens on TV, see, like 30 years ago, if something happened on a piece of video, it wasn't like 15 million people could just, screencap!
[01:33.14]And they would have it right there.
[01:37.72]You had to hear about that in the news later.
[01:41.68]or have been recording it on VHS for some reason.
[01:55.11]15 million viewer Andy.
[01:56.47]No, I'm just saying, like, the... The act of, like, if... Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.
[02:01.38]It's okay, I was only naked for, like, two seconds.
[02:03.32]I sprinted out of the way.
[02:04.86]And, like, whatever, nobody saw it.
[02:06.36]It doesn't matter, right?
[02:07.78]I mean, people saw it, but, like, okay, it's fine.
[02:10.66]No, if that happened now, in, like, 2021... Not only would it be, like... Oh, no, people can't just forget about it, whatever.
[02:17.92]Like, there would be memes of me with a clown wig on.
[02:21.98]And, like...
[02:24.68]I'm not even going to say the rest of it.
[02:27.38]I was going to say something.
[02:28.16]I was going to say something.
[02:30.22]I was going to say a clown wig on and I was going to say something else.
[02:35.31]It would be photoshopped a thousand times.
[02:38.59]And it would be everywhere.
[02:40.43]It can't just be a thing you hear about on the Channel 2 news.
[02:45.58]Once a week later.
[02:50.64]Say the whole thing.
[02:52.76]I was... Okay.
[02:55.45]No.
[02:55.75]I know.
[02:56.07]I'm not gonna do that.
[02:56.91]A clown... I was gonna say, but I put a clown nose.
[03:00.11]Forget it.
[03:03.58]Let's move on.
[03:04.62]We're gonna move on.
[03:06.00]We're moving on.
[03:16.62]I'd be in a clown wig, a clown nose, you'd put like... I don't know, you'd... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:21.54]I have this all wrong.
[03:23.04]Here's what actually would happen.
[03:24.92]You would run my naked body through like the AI generators.
[03:30.46]Like AI face generator.
[03:32.04]Let's like run his... What does he look like?
[03:34.24]It would be like cropped images of my face and stuff.
[03:36.50]Like the AI generator.
[03:37.48]That's what would happen.
[03:49.86]You know how many, like, weird, like, the thing faces would come from that screen cap?
[03:58.34]People, people in this community, you guys would probably ask me to make it an emote.
[04:04.21]Hey, dude, when are we gonna get Jerma's screen cap naked as an emote?
[04:08.63]I don't know, dude.
[04:09.61]Um, why would, no, what are you talking about?
[04:11.65]Okay.
[04:17.44]Anyways, how you doing?
[04:18.30]How are you?
[04:20.01]Welcome to the stream.
[04:20.87]I didn't even tweet this.
[04:21.61]I don't know what even happened.
[04:23.07]I've been, like, just talking.
[04:24.10]Alright, I'll be right back.
[04:25.88]I'm gonna tweet.
[04:27.12]Let people trickle in.
[04:28.60]We'll discuss.
[04:29.96]Be right back.
[05:26.24]You know, I promised my mother I'd be less vulgar on stream.
[05:31.38]I gotta, I gotta, I gotta keep my mother's, my promise to my mother.
[05:34.51]Alright, let me tweet this, and we'll talk about the plan over the next couple days.
[05:40.81]I'm still kind of fucked up.
[05:41.69]Uh, for those of you that are unaware, I've been on an antibiotic for a while.
[05:46.19]And it's given me stomach gastro problems.
[05:49.38]It's given me, like, headaches and shit.
[05:51.34]Uh, they're still here.
[05:53.16]But, like, I want to stream.
[05:54.94]I don't want to just not do anything.
[05:59.70]Until I'm not feeling great, maybe we'll see.
[06:01.70]I'm hoping I can be here for at least a few hours.
[06:06.35]Delay plans.
[06:07.37]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:08.79]Oh, well, actually, that's true.
[06:09.81]The plan with the talics got kind of screwed up.
[06:16.50]Antibiotic Andy.
[06:22.94]Thing you just did.
[06:24.08]And Andy.
[06:24.88]Andy.
[06:27.02]Take a sip of coffee.
[06:27.80]Coffee, Andy.
[06:28.32]I have to go to the doctor.
[06:30.40]Doctor Andy.
[06:30.92]I'm going to play Darkest Dungeon today.
[06:33.30]Darkest Dungeon, Andy.
[06:36.03]It's such a... It fills anything.
[06:38.15]It really is like the... It's so... It's funny.
[06:44.11]Terrible title.
[06:45.01]Yeah, I know.
[06:45.77]I just... It made me chuckle for a second.
[06:47.57]And I was just like, whatever.
[06:48.39]Fuck it.
[06:48.65]I don't care.
[06:52.27]Okay.
[06:52.89]I didn't capitalize the D in Dungeon.
[06:54.45]So everyone, please scream at me.
[07:00.94]Okay, we're going to play Darkest Dungeon 2 today.
[07:03.26]It's in early access.
[07:06.68]Played Darkest Dungeon 1 on this stream years ago.
[07:12.74]And I think a little off stream too.
[07:15.52]I played through a lot of it.
[07:17.28]Thought it was good.
[07:21.20]I'm obviously going to play the second one.
[07:22.67]So here we are.
[07:24.91]So that's today.
[07:26.35]Tomorrow, if you want to mark on your calendar, tomorrow we're going to do public domain movie night.
[07:32.26]Just for those of you that have not, don't know what that is, and maybe you haven't been here for the last few weeks.
[07:36.78]Public domain movie night is we find movies in the public domain, specifically because Halloween horror movies.
[07:43.24]So old, like 1930s, 1950s horror movies.
[07:47.83]And we're going to watch them.
[07:49.47]As long as they're in the public domain.
[07:50.87]They have been selected.
[07:52.63]There's about 10 of them.
[07:54.65]I don't think we're going to be able to watch all 10.
[07:56.11]So we're going to have to prioritize them a little bit.
[07:59.83]So we're going to watch at least probably 4 to 6.
[08:02.53]5, 6.
[08:06.40]And I don't know very much about them.
[08:14.52]All I know is that they exist.
[08:16.68]And we're going to watch them.
[08:21.60]And no, unfortunately, no Ritz Brothers.
[08:26.35]The Gorilla is the only Ritz Brothers movie in the public domain.
[08:29.45]I'm surprised.
[08:32.05]No Ritz Brothers.
[08:35.57]Here's something really funny.
[08:38.11]I was contemplating.
[08:40.76]I didn't do it because it's just like... You guys know Community Jake, right?
[08:45.66]I was contemplating just calling Community Jake...
[08:49.36]And just being like, hey, Community Jake, how do we get the licensing rights for me to stream the Ritz Brothers content?
[08:57.29]And I feel like he would just be like, I don't, what are you talking about, man?
[09:03.75]But it was an idea.
[09:05.21]I wonder how much that would be.
[09:06.81]I feel like that might be either way too little or way too much.
[09:12.72]And maybe I should find out.
[09:16.06]Like, imagine getting the licensing rights to stream, like, two or three of the Ritz Brothers movies.
[09:19.52]I don't know.
[09:23.36]Bionicle.
[09:23.98]Yeah, I can't- Bionicle's not- Look, we are- Free does not mean broadcastable in the public domain.
[09:32.61]Free on YouTube does not mean public domain film.
[09:42.37]Bionicle with Joe Biden.
[09:44.79]No, that's a funny meme.
[09:46.28]That's a really funny joke.
[09:53.61]You guys are putting the bar way too high.
[09:55.93]You guys are putting the bar too high.
[09:58.41]Like, oh, you should do like a mukbang stream where like you eat all the different fucking fast food restaurants.
[10:06.84]No, no, no, no.
[10:08.00]I want you to stream with the president of the United States of America.
[10:13.44]And I want you to watch a movie that you legally cannot watch.
[10:17.93]And you have to find a way to do that and license it.
[10:21.39]Streamer.
[10:25.69]The bar, that bar is too high.
[10:27.30]I'm not going to cross that bar.
[10:36.67]You'll just get pardoned.
[10:41.07]Can you imagine?
[10:42.31]Like I start the stream and like Joe Biden's just in the chair next to me.
[10:48.68]And I'm just like, hey, by the way, President Biden, Mr. Biden, I'm about to do something illegal.
[10:55.29]I'm going to stream Bionicle right now.
[10:56.87]And he's just like, it's alright, man.
[10:58.55]Don't worry about it.
[11:00.60]Here's the deal.
[11:02.08]I'll just pardon you after this is done.
[11:05.78]And I get sued by the Bionicle team.
[11:08.48]And then Joe Biden just waves his hand like Jedi Master style.
[11:12.19]And that's it.
[11:22.21]That would be... That would be like the funniest goddamn thing ever in the history of the world.
[11:30.09]But here's the unfortunate thing.
[11:31.87]Really, really think this is not possible.
[11:34.51]I'm sorry.
[11:34.91]It's fun to think and make up funny scenarios like it's fun.
[11:47.12]Or he doesn't.
[11:47.64]What if he doesn't pardon me?
[11:49.58]What if he doesn't pardon me?
[11:52.13]We do the whole stream together.
[11:53.19]And he like puts his sunglasses on and stands up and is just like, good luck, man.
[11:58.91]Hey, have a great rest of your stream.
[12:01.65]And he leaves and I'm like, Biden, Biden, what about that pardon?
[12:04.28]He's like, what pardon, man?
[12:07.68]I got work to do.
[12:09.20]He's just gone.
[12:10.78]And I just lose everything.
[12:11.78]I get sued by Bionicle.
[12:17.34]Faded.
[12:26.45]Come on, man.
[12:30.29]It's funny to say that.
[12:31.67]I love coming up with scenarios like this.
[12:33.63]Right?
[12:33.89]Yeah.
[12:37.09]But, okay.
[12:38.35]We can move on now.
[12:39.55]That's a what if.
[12:41.89]A Jerma Cinematic Universe what if?
[12:45.38]I haven't seen any of that, by the way.
[12:46.50]And I want to.
[12:47.50]Don't spoil anything or you're going to get banned permanently.
[12:49.78]Alright.
[12:52.98]What was the plan?
[12:53.54]The plan is today we're going to play Darkest Dungeon 2.
[12:58.81]And then, I don't know, for a while.
[13:01.31]See how long, it depends on how much I care.
[13:04.37]And then tomorrow we're gonna do public domain movie night.
[13:07.28]Or, no stream on Halloween, by the way.
[13:10.62]So, tomorrow is the Halloween stream.
[13:18.41]Biden doesn't want to even watch Bionicle.
[13:21.19]He sits down and he's like, hey, you know what I was thinking?
[13:23.97]Here's what I was thinking.
[13:25.89]Can we watch the funny memes that I used to watch in school 42 on YouTube?
[13:33.12]I'm just like, okay.
[13:37.80]No, no, no.
[13:38.32]I want to watch clean memes to show your grandma unusual videos compilation 700.
[13:43.48]And I'd do it.
[13:59.68]Family Guy.
[14:02.08]And he is laughing his ass off at every joke.
[14:05.26]That big like laugh with the big smile.
[14:09.48]He's laughing.
[14:10.46]He's having so much fun.
[14:16.36]Play the game?
[14:17.28]I know.
[14:17.69]Alright.
[14:18.15]Here's the game.
[14:19.37]Wait.
[14:19.87]Okay.
[14:23.65]Darkest Dungeon 2.
[14:25.25]It's on the Epic Games Store right now.
[14:27.59]It's an early access game.
[14:30.39]Now here's, uh, now here's the deal.
[14:33.18]Here's the deal.
[14:33.62]Alright, no, there's no more Joe Biden shit.
[14:36.36]Let's go.
[14:40.48]Uh, I, when Darkest Dungeon 1 came out, I didn't play the very early, early access version.
[14:46.87]I played it pretty deep into early access, I think, if I remember.
[14:50.33]So apparently this is very early.
[14:51.63]Um, I hear very mixed things about it so far.
[14:57.33]I'm gonna give it my own opinion.
[15:00.06]Gonna give my own assessment of the game.
[15:03.26]This is Darkest Dungeon 2, Early Access, Day 1, and then brackets plus 2, plus 3.
[15:11.81]It's kind of loud.
[15:16.65]All the bad reviews are just people that are bad.
[15:18.85]Okay.
[15:26.03]That should have been the stream title.
[15:29.65]Alright, new journey.
[15:30.15]Let's go.
[15:33.87]I can't wait until he says, Confident, sir, just as the enemy scrumbles, whatever it is.
[15:38.96]Quiet.
[15:45.08]Complete your confession.
[15:47.28]Hereby acknowledge and accept the fullness and severity of my mistakes.
[15:51.07]Denial.
[15:52.13]Play cinematic.
[15:54.49]I opened it once to just capture it, so let's do cinematic.
[15:56.75]Quiet.
[15:56.99]Everybody shut up.
[16:27.64]Ruin has found you at last.
[16:32.06]My protege.
[16:34.22]My friend.
[16:36.92]Our calculations were correct.
[16:39.80]The ephemeral equation is unbalanced.
[16:43.12]The Earth spins on a strange and terrifying new axis.
[16:47.95]And everywhere, unbridled consequence.
[16:53.45]The world is a wasteland of failures past.
[16:57.55]And yet, you must ride out into it.
[17:02.08]Unafraid.
[17:02.70]Take this.
[17:05.90]It is hope.
[17:06.20]The very last of it.
[17:06.66]It is yours now.
[17:16.95]That was average.
[17:18.10]It was below average, actually.
[17:23.00]This guy's voice is so distinct.
[17:24.04]Do you think he just puts on his resume, Darkest Dungeon guy, and everyone goes, holy shit, I know who that is.
[17:44.98]Like vocal range, right?
[17:46.95]Like, oh, what on your resume?
[17:48.27]Vocal range.
[17:49.45]Darkest Dungeon guy.
[17:51.60]It's like, oh, okay, yeah, I know exactly what you sound like.
[17:54.90]And you're hired, by the way.
[18:00.21]Okay, complete your confession.
[18:01.45]Denial.
[18:03.42]I sign my name.
[18:04.34]You have cowered in your crumbling denial long enough.
[18:09.88]The stagecoach.
[18:11.60]Left click view, right click.
[18:13.04]Okay, the stagecoach.
[18:14.61]Stagecoach is your carriage, your coffin, and your confessional.
[18:19.17]Okay, that's kind of extreme.
[18:22.99]Press W to drive the coach forward.
[18:26.66]Double tap W for auto drive.
[18:29.64]Use A and D to steer.
[18:30.73]Plus one letter grade.
[18:35.21]I mean, I have to... If that's going to be a thing on this channel, we have to stick to it.
[18:41.42]That's plus one for letter grade.
[18:44.65]I'll press Z to bring up the stagecoach view.
[18:48.67]It shows what upgrades are currently installed on the coach.
[18:51.97]Upgrades can be changed at the Wainwright, who is present at each inn.
[18:58.20]Okay, so this show you can upgrade the stagecoach.
[19:00.52]Okay.
[19:01.72]Let's just go.
[19:06.62]Okay.
[19:12.62]The flame.
[19:13.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:15.79]It's just like the candlelight thing in the first game.
[19:34.52]And when the flame hits below 40, things start to get significantly more dangerous for the heroes.
[19:38.96]Monsters get combat bonuses.
[19:40.35]They can get surprised or whatever.
[19:42.19]There are increased chances that battle modifiers... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:46.63]When the flame reaches zero, the heroes are ambushed by the fiendish cultists.
[19:52.00]If the heroes survive the fight, then the expedition will continue with a tiny flicker of flame still left.
[19:56.14]Alright, so that's more important than the last game.
[19:59.58]The game is really hard.
[20:04.59]Uh... Eat Spamton first try.
[20:05.87]So, I think I'm still on that high.
[20:07.55]I'll be fine.
[20:09.77]Crossroads, alright.
[20:11.61]Do I have to pick guilt?
[20:17.35]Loathing, failure, regret, disgrace.
[20:19.07]Okay, the crossroads.
[20:25.99]Um... Is this... Okay, is this just a party?
[20:28.89]It's a party.
[20:32.54]Four heroes will join together on this expedition.
[20:34.84]Our salvation rides with them.
[20:37.32]Party creation.
[20:38.81]Click and drag hero portraits to assemble your party of four heroes.
[20:42.73]The hero in the rightmost position of your... Yeah, he's in the combat... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:48.29]Okay.
[20:50.02]You can rearrange your party order while driving by clicking and dragging their portraits.
[20:56.19]Party order determines what position each hero is in when the battle starts right and yeah, just like the last game The furthest hero to the right begins at the front of the yeah, I know I know Alright, so what is this just this is just we have it's only four possible people Oh Click and drag them or they're just here.
[21:16.06]Oh, it's down here.
[21:17.52]Oh
[21:19.93]Man-at-arms is like the tank slash protector.
[21:23.62]Guard.
[21:25.18]Yeah, you put guard on somebody and they block attacks.
[21:29.22]Highwayman usually goes kind of in the back, right?
[21:31.78]It's the ranged.
[21:32.64]High damage.
[21:37.77]Plague doctor throws the grenades, right?
[21:39.65]Throws the poison grenades.
[21:40.67]You want this person right in the back.
[21:43.55]Brave robber has stealth, right?
[21:45.67]You can like stealth and then do like big dive forward.
[21:47.98]I remember the first one.
[21:48.78]I played it a lot.
[21:53.99]Don't let Joe Biden backseat you on this.
[22:01.65]Okay, whatever.
[22:02.65]Here we go.
[22:03.07]I got my party.
[22:03.81]This is where they should be.
[22:06.05]Let's go.
[22:12.09]Stop pretending.
[22:14.77]Get out of here.
[22:17.79]I just put the party in the tutorial positions.
[22:22.47]Forty-one?
[22:24.76]Can you crash?
[22:27.06]What if I crash into these leaves?
[22:28.04]Is that gonna be bad?
[22:30.58]Is it bad?
[22:32.70]Like, do I get points for hitting things or not hitting things?
[22:39.07]This is a tight turn.
[22:41.51]Oh, shit.
[22:42.35]The academic's cache.
[22:46.89]Supplies.
[22:50.25]Coach of Lie.
[22:51.97]Clear all corpses.
[22:53.07]Clear all corpses.
[22:54.13]Do you have an inventory in this one, or is it just a giant stagecoach with just tons of room?
[22:58.56]Dartboard.
[23:00.46]High chance of improving affinity.
[23:01.64]Very small chance of harming affinity.
[23:03.90]Minus one stress.
[23:05.18]It's an in-item, okay.
[23:07.84]Boxing gloves.
[23:09.72]Minus one stress.
[23:11.69]Chance of positive or negative affinity.
[23:15.38]Blocked by bum, leg, head.
[23:17.34]Alright.
[23:17.84]I'm just going to take it all.
[23:19.02]Should I just take it all?
[23:19.64]Whatever.
[23:19.90]I'm just taking it all.
[23:23.50]Why do they have... What's this?
[23:27.88]Why do they have notifications?
[23:28.74]I was going to do auto run.
[23:32.70]Nine leagues to end.
[23:34.88]I remember our first meeting on the steps of the university.
[23:38.36]This person's driving crazy.
[23:39.84]This is worse than I was driving.
[23:40.94]That would doom us both.
[23:47.17]A desperate few.
[23:49.99]Encounters, treasures, inventory.
[23:53.45]Hold on.
[23:54.13]This is like a choose-your-own-adventure game now?
[23:56.31]Alright, wait.
[23:56.67]Encounters.
[23:57.01]We got a lot of reading.
[23:59.45]Settle down.
[24:00.39]During encounters such as this one, heroes will voice opinions on a course of action.
[24:04.78]You must choose one of their wishes.
[24:08.32]You can hold on a choice to select it.
[24:09.46]The results will be previewed at the bottom of the screen.
[24:12.38]Oh, here we go.
[24:13.08]Oh, boy.
[24:13.80]Hold on.
[24:15.60]Your stagecoach is limited in how many items it can carry per se.
[24:17.98]Okay, I is just the stagecoach inventory.
[24:20.00]Alright.
[24:23.10]Your shared inventory is split between all item types.
[24:26.48]Some items stack well, whereas others take an entire slot.
[24:29.73]Okay.
[24:30.75]Use the inventory tabs to easily see each item type.
[24:33.45]Some stagecoach upgrades increase stacking limits.
[24:35.55]Alright, that's good to know.
[24:37.53]If the stagecoach becomes full, you may wish to discard less important items.
[24:44.04]Just click and drag them out of the window.
[24:45.30]Alright.
[24:49.16]Read me a bedtime story.
[24:50.32]You're doing the reading joke.
[24:52.09]Yeah, good night.
[24:56.93]Have a good rest.
[24:57.59]Hey, don't worry.
[24:58.93]I'll wake you up when I scream because one of my, like, party members dies in the first round.
[25:03.55]Don't worry, you'll be up soon.
[25:05.43]Have a nice nap.
[25:07.41]Items cannot be sold anywhere, so throw away what you don't need.
[25:10.37]Discarding items earns a small amount of hope.
[25:14.25]So this is, you can't sell anything.
[25:16.41]If you don't, you just have to throw shit in the trash.
[25:20.37]Trinkets, combat items, in-items, and I almost just said Sasquatch will help you on your quest.
[25:27.46]Yes.
[25:28.20]You'll also find relics and baubles, which can be used to purchase supplies from vendors, alright?
[25:33.18]Trinkets are from the first game.
[25:34.28]I remember these.
[25:34.90]They can have two.
[25:36.08]They offer bonuses.
[25:38.58]They can be swapped at any time.
[25:39.76]You click and drag.
[25:41.04]You equip them.
[25:42.32]They're in the trinket menu.
[25:43.86]Combat items are equipped into a dedicated skill slot on each hero.
[25:47.02]Okay, that's different.
[25:48.99]Click the slot and then double-click or drag the combat item.
[25:53.67]So there's a skill slot.
[25:57.85]Mastery points.
[25:58.73]Mastery points are earned mostly through combat victories.
[26:01.59]Imagine going to your teacher in college or something, and they are reading the syllabus with you, and they sound as confused as I do.
[26:11.00]The streamer is supposed to be the confident one.
[26:13.08]I'm supposed to be the confident one telling you these things.
[26:15.65]But I'm just up at the front of the classroom and I don't even know what's going on.
[26:21.73]I'm a math teacher that they moved over to the science department and they said, good luck.
[26:25.88]You start tomorrow.
[26:28.90]Mastery points are earned through combat victories.
[26:31.18]Each point will upgrade one hero's skill.
[26:34.30]We're almost there.
[26:35.32]We're almost there.
[26:36.12]We're almost there.
[26:39.05]Relics are the main currency of the land.
[26:42.09]Used to buy most supplies.
[26:43.41]You find relics mostly as spoils of battle.
[26:44.96]Alright, so relics, just like the first game.
[26:46.72]Just need to make sure I understand.
[26:50.09]Bobbles are used only to purchase trinkets.
[26:52.84]Bobbles come in different forms for each region.
[26:55.24]Am I going to do the thing?
[26:56.60]I have to say, let me tell the story real quickly.
[26:59.16]My mother used to read me stories in bed.
[27:02.19]And I could tell when she was getting really tired and she was falling asleep, her eyes were almost closed.
[27:06.49]And I would nudge her arm when she started to fall asleep and she would kick back up again.
[27:13.02]She'd be like, Bobbles come in different forms for each reason.
[27:16.08]All bobble types are worth the same, but take of a different.
[27:19.38]Nudge in your inventory.
[27:21.21]Your total bobbers are shown by the triangle-like symbol in the inventory.
[27:25.25]Nudge.
[27:26.59]I would, like, keep waking her back up.
[27:29.03]That was last week.
[27:29.79]I didn't even process this.
[27:32.07]Let me, alright, start timing people out that say process this in fucking capitals or whatever they're saying.
[27:38.75]When you choose a hero's response, any heroes that agree with the
[27:42.75]Oh, hold on.
[27:43.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[27:43.70]This is important.
[27:44.26]Okay.
[28:01.75]Any heroes that agree will have their mutual affinity increased.
[28:05.50]A gold glow.
[28:06.34]Any heroes that disagree will have their neutral... Okay.
[28:10.82]So people don't agree on things.
[28:12.55]Alright.
[28:14.33]Each region is overwhelmed with local evil, resistance encounters, or battles with these monsters.
[28:19.57]Winning resistance encounters is the primary way in which you can gain mastery points and earn treasures that will make the heroes more powerful.
[28:26.06]It also reduces loathing.
[28:28.98]Battling evil is not without risk, but if you avoid all resistance encounters, you will find the party ill-prepared to tackle the mountain.
[28:34.18]Okay?
[28:36.78]Will you even remember all this?
[28:39.04]No.
[28:40.08]I probably don't.
[28:41.30]Honestly, I don't even remember opening the game.
[28:44.98]I remember talking about Joe Biden sitting next to me.
[28:50.82]And, like, him not pardoning me.
[28:52.64]That's all I remember.
[28:53.52]But that's not even part of the game.
[28:55.53]Right?
[28:55.95]Like, that's... Whatever.
[28:58.65]Assistance encounters bring the heroes face to face with the downtrodden local populace.
[29:01.45]These forlorn creatures are in need of help and often have valuable supplies.
[29:05.03]Okay, you just help the locals.
[29:08.15]Cultists are evil and you just attack them.
[29:11.20]They emanate from the mountain and the great evil contained therein.
[29:13.72]Cultists encounter an always tough fight, but the rewards are very valuable.
[29:17.06]Stave off the evil.
[29:18.14]Reduce your loathing.
[29:19.02]Let's go.
[29:21.18]Alright, so what's the way to help us?
[29:24.06]Let all kind folk unite under the banner of our light.
[29:30.26]It's on us to carry the torch and it's a long road.
[29:34.94]Hope is contagious once it catches.
[29:38.40]The grave robber didn't even want to say anything.
[29:41.58]Hope is contagious once it catches.
[29:45.53]I feel like, do they have to, do they get in the car?
[29:47.51]Let's see what happens.
[29:50.63]Nudge.
[29:51.89]Let all kind folk unite under the banner of our light.
[29:54.33]Everybody say yes.
[30:01.25]Yes.
[30:02.45]They all like that.
[30:03.09]50 flame.
[30:05.29]Okay.
[30:07.16]Slime mold.
[30:09.28]Restores 10% HP minus 10% disease resist.
[30:10.38]Okay.
[30:17.19]Make, might make, whatever.
[30:18.67]Go.
[30:23.41]I do, I like the art style.
[30:24.47]I think it looks, um... They're kind of like all grown up.
[30:30.13]They're all like, they have like big long arms and stuff.
[30:32.33]And the other one over there's kind of torsos.
[30:33.97]Um, they were like kind of short and stumpy in the original one, right?
[30:37.19]10% rigging.
[30:38.97]Let's go.
[30:42.41]Heroes.
[30:43.89]Hero status, you use critical information...
[30:47.70]If I have a question, I'm going to ask you.
[30:49.96]You see, even your valley is not immune to the spreading.
[30:55.57]Oh, this looks good.
[30:56.39]This looks really nice.
[30:59.51]This looks amazing.
[31:02.09]Okay, so here we go.
[31:03.47]Pick to the face.
[31:04.57]Throne, dagger.
[31:05.81]What do they got?
[31:06.23]Is that blight, I imagine.
[31:09.55]I assume it's probably the same from the last one.
[31:11.64]Blight.
[31:11.84]Alright, we're just going to go.
[31:12.54]It's probably just very simple.
[31:13.54]Let's just do pick to the face.
[31:19.16]Back.
[31:21.30]Very cool.
[31:22.08]Big crit.
[31:25.66]Pistol shot's probably better.
[31:27.04]Or actually, let me see.
[31:30.14]This is when you dive forward.
[31:31.48]Take aim.
[31:31.74]This marks people, I think.
[31:32.80]Yeah, let's just kill people.
[31:36.73]We fight together.
[31:37.75]Plague Doctor has the grenade.
[31:40.91]What's this?
[31:43.53]Amounts of prevention.
[31:44.31]This is plus 10% resistance.
[31:45.73]Okay, so it's just resistance?
[31:46.59]Resistance?
[31:48.60]And this is a blight.
[31:49.38]Do they have blight?
[31:49.92]Yeah, this might not land, but whatever.
[31:54.25]Is there anything different?
[31:55.61]There might be something different.
[32:01.79]Turn based, yep.
[32:04.35]Turn order is based on speed, right?
[32:06.53]It is.
[32:08.15]Fortress actions.
[32:10.02]Yeah, I know.
[32:10.88]I played the first one.
[32:12.10]Skills.
[32:12.72]Skills can be used for heroes in the correct launch rank.
[32:15.24]Yes, yes, yes.
[32:18.77]Yep, I know.
[32:19.81]I played the first one.
[32:20.83]Effects, yep.
[32:25.01]Most of these effects are shown by tokens.
[32:28.42]Mouse over the token, okay.
[32:30.42]Token view.
[32:31.18]This is different.
[32:32.18]No, it's not.
[32:32.50]Okay.
[32:35.38]What's this?
[32:38.16]What if that's really important?
[32:39.00]I don't know what it is.
[32:44.52]Dots.
[32:45.50]Okay, monster death's door.
[32:47.58]When a hero is reduced to 0 HP, they're at death's door, right?
[32:50.14]And if you take damage after that, there's a chance you're going to die.
[32:52.44]It rolls it, right?
[32:55.07]With this death blow resistance.
[32:57.15]Was that the first one?
[32:57.71]Some monsters have death blow resistance, just like heroes.
[33:03.75]When a monster is on death's door, each further blow has a chance to slay it.
[33:06.91]That's new.
[33:08.77]Executing the target with some trinkets.
[33:12.41]Oh, what do we got?
[33:13.23]We got Ludwig coming in?
[33:16.80]Is that Ludwig coming in right now?
[33:21.04]What's up?
[33:24.92]Tutorial Andy here.
[33:26.78]Doing Darkest Dungeon.
[33:28.62]Thanks for the raid, dude.
[33:30.46]Hope you're doing well.
[33:32.94]Good to see you guys all again.
[33:35.61]My name is Jerma.
[33:38.34]Do the raid song.
[33:39.06]We don't do raid songs incoming or outgoing anymore.
[33:43.00]If you're doing raid songs still, you're on like season two of like eight seasons.
[33:49.59]You can't come into a stream on season two and start talking about season two stuff.
[33:55.39]We're on season eight, man.
[33:56.25]We're talking about the characters and stuff going on in season eight.
[34:01.70]Callback raid.
[34:03.73]Nah, thanks a lot, dude.
[34:04.51]Welcome back.
[34:05.93]Darkest Dungeon 2.
[34:06.61]Gonna be a very boring 20 minutes, I think, first, because I just started.
[34:14.65]And love goes right back to Ludwig.
[34:20.05]Season 8's episodes release too slowly.
[34:24.26]Yeah, well... I don't know.
[34:26.52]Look, it takes... Whatever.
[34:27.72]Alright, I got a token.
[34:29.54]Let's just kill this guy.
[34:33.89]Season 8 is the worst season.
[34:36.77]I've already talked about this.
[34:37.67]I talked about this already.
[34:39.91]We're on season 10 of Jerma985.
[34:46.86]Once you cross 7, 8, 9 seasons, that's when people start to go, oh, this show's not very good anymore.
[34:51.78]I have to be careful.
[34:53.44]I'm at that point.
[34:53.98]Is this money?
[34:58.72]Oh, relics.
[34:59.24]Okay.
[34:59.42]Alright, that was good.
[35:06.28]End of the season voice.
[35:14.73]Season one was the best one.
[35:16.33]I don't know.
[35:17.24]I feel like seasons...
[35:20.31]2 through 7 have been really good.
[35:23.83]I think seasons 8 through 10 have been fantastic as well.
[35:27.05]Oh god, where are we?
[35:30.45]This is the inn.
[35:32.93]Glimmer of hope in the quickening dark.
[35:34.45]Heal to 100%.
[35:34.81]Should I do that?
[35:37.89]Uh, travel log.
[35:39.29]Barristan and Audrey became more friendly.
[35:42.66]Ismis and Audrey became friendly.
[35:44.36]Barristan and Paracelus became more friendly.
[35:46.90]Alright, so they're all like friends.
[35:50.83]in items what is this comcast season was my favorite season I don't I mean that season was pretty good but um I really didn't like how in the middle of uh every episode it went to a black screen for four hours and then came back I didn't like that high chance of improving affinity with very small chance of harming affinity
[36:22.05]comcast alright so two targets these are my currencies relics mastery and baubles alright do I need to buy anything or should I save my money artboard let me just get it how much does it cost how much does it cost in items how much does it cost
[36:48.41]Oh wait, that's my inventory.
[36:49.65]Is that my inventory?
[36:51.19]That's what you have.
[36:52.92]You potty.
[36:53.44]Did you just call me a potty?
[36:56.48]Like a baby potty?
[36:58.52]That's a new one.
[36:59.06]Okay, so this is what I have.
[37:03.50]All items.
[37:06.48]Oh, I can use these in the inn.
[37:08.22]I can only use them in the inn.
[37:11.24]Okay, that makes sense.
[37:11.86]I don't think I need to use any of this.
[37:18.08]51, 50.
[37:18.12]Yeah, I don't need to use any items.
[37:23.62]Mastery Trainer?
[37:25.36]This is... upgrades?
[37:31.23]How much does it cost to upgrade?
[37:32.15]I don't want to click anything.
[37:32.87]I'm afraid to click something.
[37:33.93]What about... Oh, it's click and hold.
[37:36.65]Okay, so this is upgrading.
[37:39.15]It's one point per skill upgrade?
[37:44.87]It's one per ability.
[37:46.03]Okay.
[37:50.44]I usually like the Plague Doctor.
[37:55.24]I love the dots.
[37:57.60]The grenade dot is one of my favorite moves.
[38:01.03]If I'm going to do something, I want to do that.
[38:06.89]Where is it?
[38:08.33]Noxious Blast.
[38:08.97]Here it is.
[38:13.19]Wait, does...
[38:17.02]Is that it?
[38:17.40]Is that a dot?
[38:18.38]Damage two to three, target four.
[38:20.43]How do I see like the... It's four per turn, right?
[38:27.81]Balance and prevention is a great upgrade.
[38:29.49]It is.
[38:29.79]Heal.
[38:36.62]Hold on.
[38:37.48]Target HP less than 50%, heal 20%.
[38:39.26]Does that mean if they're under 50%?
[38:49.64]Yes.
[38:50.44]So if they're over 50%, it doesn't heal.
[38:54.38]That's kind of terrifying.
[38:55.32]I'm going to go with this.
[38:58.07]I'm going to upgrade Noxious Blast.
[38:59.11]I love dots.
[38:59.95]It's one of my favorite things.
[39:01.13]Affliction Warlock was my favorite.
[39:07.35]Wild reference.
[39:07.97]I'm sorry.
[39:09.90]I'm sorry.
[39:10.18]I got electrocuted.
[39:11.12]You guys hit the button at the same time.
[39:14.76]That only activates if 5,000 people hit the button at the same time.
[39:20.72]I'm so sorry.
[39:23.61]Ow.
[39:26.27]Ah, my, like, neck hurts.
[39:27.63]Okay, I'm gonna do this.
[39:33.79]I make wow reference.
[39:34.92]Don't press the button again.
[39:36.44]I just said the fucking name of the game.
[39:37.78]Relax.
[39:41.06]Okay, so now this is... Uh... Did it go through?
[39:45.66]Okay.
[39:50.25]You need stress relief.
[39:52.23]Um, okay.
[39:54.71]It's a sex thing?
[39:57.36]Okay, storage trunk plus four inventory slots.
[40:09.30]Ooh, okay.
[40:14.05]So this is upgrades, stagecoach upgrade.
[40:17.03]Pets?
[40:17.55]Trophies?
[40:21.80]Did that upgrade this?
[40:23.84]Six.
[40:24.26]Oh, that's really good.
[40:25.04]I love it already.
[40:26.03]Alright, select route.
[40:28.13]The FOTOR or the Tangle?
[40:32.05]Rupting or Booty?
[40:35.05]I feel like I just upgraded the guy.
[40:36.69]This is bad, right?
[40:44.74]Yeah.
[40:44.96]100% scout chance for academics caches.
[40:47.30]Hope plus 250.
[40:51.13]Yeah.
[40:52.13]The other one I think is going to get resistance from Plague Doctor.
[40:56.11]I'm ready to go.
[40:59.24]Let's go.
[41:00.52]Burning onward.
[41:01.02]Yeah.
[41:03.48]Use the end items?
[41:04.46]I... Should I have?
[41:06.92]Oops.
[41:11.70]Photor.
[41:14.28]Whoa.
[41:14.76]That's long.
[41:21.51]That's so long.
[41:23.45]What?
[41:25.98]Oh my god.
[41:29.48]That's long.
[41:35.62]What do you guys have this thing on your... Oh, trinkets.
[41:40.29]Do I have trinkets?
[41:42.45]Oh shit, yeah.
[41:43.01]Put that on.
[41:48.85]Do I give them combat items?
[41:51.23]Can I even do?
[41:51.91]How do I do that?
[41:52.53]Combat skills.
[41:54.29]Oh, okay.
[41:54.71]Here we go.
[41:56.17]Clear all corpses.
[41:57.01]Yeah, sure.
[41:57.41]You're in the back.
[41:58.09]You take that one.
[42:02.17]Combat item.
[42:02.97]I'm going to give these to people.
[42:07.23]Why does this sound like Spider-Man 3 music?
[42:13.27]Oh shit, do I have to pick one?
[42:17.23]Assistance encounter?
[42:19.67]Unknown.
[42:21.70]We're going.
[42:24.70]Oh, nope.
[42:26.06]I can't say it.
[42:27.82]I was going to sing it, but we just got raided and I don't want to sound like a fucking weirdo.
[42:33.90]I was going to go into the unknown.
[42:39.97]What's that?
[42:43.00]Should I touch that?
[42:43.62]I don't know what that is.
[42:47.96]Are there no torches?
[42:54.92]Light.
[42:55.88]Bright light.
[43:01.21]I don't want to touch the... Okay, I need to see what happens.
[43:04.41]Nothing.
[43:07.33]The hoarder.
[43:12.77]Oh, shit.
[43:15.09]Bandages?
[43:16.93]Um... Oh, wow.
[43:18.63]Okay.
[43:23.38]Medicinal herbs.
[43:24.32]Okay.
[43:24.96]If target is bleed, or if target is blighted, or if target is burned.
[43:29.44]So this is a cure-all.
[43:30.84]This cures something.
[43:31.62]Did I get it?
[43:37.00]Moderate heal.
[43:38.42]I think I'm gonna buy this.
[43:41.80]I might be wasting money, but whatever.
[43:48.06]I don't know.
[43:48.56]I'm buying.
[43:49.82]Guys, when I played Darkest Dungeon, I used to buy like 30 food.
[43:52.99]And I never had any money.
[43:56.17]I just was terrified of runs.
[44:00.00]Minus three stress.
[44:01.64]I want that one.
[44:09.96]Okay, what's this?
[44:12.42]That's 25% of resistances.
[44:15.72]I don't have enough baubles for this.
[44:16.86]Alright, let's just go.
[44:17.54]I got some stuff.
[44:18.48]Let's go.
[44:20.55]How do I go back?
[44:21.05]Okay, the hoarder.
[44:23.21]Now from here, Hero Shrine.
[44:25.21]Continue a hero's story.
[44:29.61]Or to unknowns.
[44:31.72]Hero Shrine.
[44:35.18]Oh no, here comes Herobrine.
[44:37.24]What?
[44:42.60]Isn't that the Minecraft guy?
[44:48.75]It's like a nightmare out there.
[44:50.03]This individual story progression for each character?
[44:59.44]Wait, I... Hold on.
[45:00.34]I'm sorry.
[45:01.22]I know this is like video game Andy, gameplay, tutorial gaming Andy stream, but I need to know this.
[45:06.36]There's the mini-map.
[45:13.60]Okay, um... In items.
[45:18.59]Let me read this.
[45:20.37]Heal, de-stress, or do buffs.
[45:22.73]Change the affinity between heroes.
[45:24.57]I guess I have to draw.
[45:26.27]I get it.
[45:26.61]Alright.
[45:30.98]Target hero.
[45:31.58]Okay.
[45:32.12]Items may affect one, two, or even all four heroes at once.
[45:37.54]Wainwright is the only place where you can install or remove stagecoach upgrades.
[45:40.94]Okay.
[45:41.16]Okay.
[45:43.81]Region choice matters because you've got different affinities, right?
[45:51.09]Yeah, I need to know how to play.
[45:52.15]Yeah, guys, you know this two, this double-edged sword here, okay?
[45:56.19]If I grab, I'm gonna, I have to grab both ends of the sword at the same time and just like bite the sword and use it in my teeth and cut my mouth too.
[46:03.30]Like, if I don't do the tutorial, I'm gonna get my ass kicked and you guys are all gonna make fun of me.
[46:08.68]But if I do the tutorial, everybody says this is too slow, and then everyone makes fun of me.
[46:13.22]So I have to just bite, I have to bite the sword with my mouth, and just go.
[46:23.91]What?
[46:31.23]Ooh, okay, hold on.
[46:32.96]This is Echoes of the Past.
[46:35.32]Balls will never again hold me.
[46:38.24]My ambition outflanked my fellow officers at stories and mock skirmishes.
[46:44.36]Tradition drove us into each other's arms, or estates rather.
[46:47.39]The jeers, the whispers, they pushed me deep into my studies.
[46:50.25]You.
[46:56.11]Good student.
[46:56.91]Hmm.
[47:06.67]Am I in like a different game?
[47:07.81]A good student.
[47:10.29]Brilliant and bold.
[47:12.32]Her unconventional theories created nothing short of a scandal in her fourth year.
[47:17.36]Is she hearing like this story?
[47:19.04]The mocking whispers and scornful glares of her peers and professors had an ironically invigorating effect on her extracurricular experiments.
[47:31.28]The mysteries of the human body, of life and death itself,
[47:37.37]Do you think people leaned back and put their head forward really hard and drove this into people's heads as a weapon?
[47:46.98]A headbutt from a plague doctor would be horrible.
[47:53.79]Rewards.
[47:55.63]Oh my god, yes.
[47:58.51]What is this?
[48:01.10]Do us the taking.
[48:01.66]Plus one mastery.
[48:03.75]And emboldening vapors.
[48:06.21]What does it do?
[48:07.99]Target.
[48:08.43]Cooldown.
[48:09.09]One.
[48:09.35]What is it?
[48:10.37]How do I look at it?
[48:14.09]Is it a magic trick?
[48:16.67]Do I just throw gas in the air?
[48:18.23]What is this?
[48:19.69]It's a party buff?
[48:20.43]How do I see what it does?
[48:26.15]It's an attack buff?
[48:27.31]Oh, you shitting me.
[48:28.37]Gonna get to the end in this first playthrough.
[48:32.10]Sorry, my real voice came through.
[48:33.24]Alright.
[48:36.94]I'm sure... Look, it's like Dark Souls, right?
[48:39.13]You just... You have to just play.
[48:42.47]But I want to... How do I look at what it does?
[48:48.22]It does...
[48:52.36]Patrol shift.
[48:53.12]I want to know what... Does it know just nothing?
[48:58.89]Bring some more water.
[48:59.69]Ooh, cash or cultist encounter.
[49:06.86]I can't just take the easy road, right?
[49:08.50]I kind of have to do one of these.
[49:10.72]Oh, gee.
[49:12.98]Oh, my.
[49:13.42]Okay.
[49:13.80]Wow.
[49:13.98]That's actually really good.
[49:23.65]I'm just going with the money.
[49:30.25]If you can make it.
[49:32.87]Tell us another.
[49:35.15]How do you get... Is there no torches?
[49:39.43]Each hero has an affinity value which describes how positive or negative they feel towards one another.
[49:44.32]If the affinity bar fails, the two heroes will eventually enter a relationship.
[49:47.88]What?
[49:49.60]I need to read this.
[49:53.00]Really?
[49:53.22]Okay, well... Wait, hold on.
[50:23.37]If the way ahead is scouted, these icons will be revealed.
[50:25.91]Right.
[50:27.23]Heroes may voice their own preference for the route shown by corresponding icons above their portrait heads.
[50:32.26]Beware, choosing a destination different than what a hero wants will cause them stress.
[50:36.60]Oh shit, I'm glad I read that.
[50:37.88]Alright, where's the money?
[50:50.59]There it is.
[50:54.65]The academic's cash.
[51:02.00]Finish it for me.
[51:05.12]Come on.
[51:05.62]Finish it for me.
[51:06.14]I want to see you finish it for me.
[51:07.68]Finish it for me.
[51:11.04]There it is.
[51:12.12]Thank you.
[51:12.78]There it is.
[51:13.64]Nice.
[51:13.88]Fuck yeah.
[51:18.50]Fuck yeah.
[51:20.29]Okay.
[51:21.59]Uh, can I take it all?
[51:23.75]Relics.
[51:25.26]An Icaro bomb.
[51:27.00]Very large attack blight.
[51:30.04]Negative token or if... I feel like I'm in logic class again.
[51:36.32]Negative token or if this, then remove all... This is just logic.
[51:42.78]My brain can't do it.
[51:43.60]Alright, take all.
[51:48.00]A lovely little turn.
[51:53.30]Logic actually was really fun.
[51:55.02]As kind of complicated as Logic got.
[51:57.36]It was actually really fun.
[52:00.68]Alright, we have to fight somebody.
[52:01.62]Let's go.
[52:01.96]We're going this way.
[52:13.96]Did you fail it?
[52:14.60]No.
[52:14.88]What the fuck is this thing?
[52:19.58]Okay.
[52:20.50]What do you do?
[52:20.94]75 blight resistance.
[52:23.28]That's fantastic because I just upgraded her.
[52:25.08]What's your defense?
[52:30.98]Is there a defense?
[52:32.08]What's defense?
[52:33.28]Alright, we're going to go with... Alright, should I... I'm going to mark.
[52:39.19]Take aim.
[52:39.79]Whoa, wait, what?
[52:40.87]Should I take aim?
[52:42.97]What's this do?
[52:43.35]I don't know.
[52:48.56]We're just going to shoot him.
[52:52.32]Confident surge as the enemy crumbles.
[52:57.69]What do we got?
[52:58.91]I got to take this person out.
[52:59.95]This person sprees me out.
[53:03.39]No blight.
[53:10.63]Ooh, that hurts.
[53:11.95]Oh my god, that hurt.

[53:43.51]This is a knockback.
[53:45.17]Then let's just go.
[53:46.03]Let's just try to kill this guy.
[53:50.13]These guys aren't doing that much damage.
[53:51.21]It's fine.
[53:52.45]I need to heal.
[53:53.13]Who is it?
[53:53.61]Oh, I didn't equip the combat moves.
[53:54.97]Oh, fuck.
[53:55.41]This is bad.
[53:58.56]Uh.
[54:00.50]Wait.
[54:01.92]Self.
[54:02.32]Yeah.
[54:02.54]It's a self heal.
[54:06.60]What?
[54:07.72]What?
[54:08.20]What is it?
[54:08.50]Minus what?
[54:10.38]Wait.
[54:10.56]What was that?
[54:13.05]Is that not minus... less than 50%?
[54:14.49]Okay, that's weird.
[54:18.15]Alright.
[54:18.65]Um... Wait!
[54:19.67]If my... misdivide... I don't... I don't... that's weird.
[54:22.97]If... if you're... I can't heal you unless you're under 50%?
[54:25.04]How am I supposed to know?
[54:26.98]How do I tell?
[54:27.52]Is that... are you under 50%?
[54:37.87]Oh, fuck it.
[54:38.25]Whatever.
[54:40.48]Okay, yeah, that works.
[54:42.64]I'm used to just spamming that move on people.
[54:44.62]Alright, let's keep this up.
[54:48.20]Let's do pistol shot.
[54:51.14]It's long division.
[54:52.06]It's not long division.
[54:54.26]And that's how you fucking win games, by the way.
[55:08.25]If nobody is under 50%, I won't let you use it.
[55:14.32]Round three of five.
[55:15.96]What does that mean?
[55:16.86]Three rounds remain.
[55:19.84]I have a finite amount of time to do this?
[55:29.72]Yeah?
[55:31.00]What?
[55:34.35]What happens if I don't finish it in this round?
[55:41.76]There we go.
[55:42.16]Death's door.
[55:43.12]Give me a break.
[55:44.42]That didn't kill it?
[55:46.86]What?
[55:47.40]Oh, God.
[55:49.78]After five rounds, the cart drives away.
[55:51.97]What?
[55:58.17]I should have read the tutorial.
[55:59.81]Ow, I'm grabbing one end.
[56:01.15]Ow, I'm grabbing the other end.
[56:02.76]My hands are covered in blood.
[56:03.94]I can't even grab the sword anymore.
[56:06.94]I'll get it.
[56:07.46]I'll get it.
[56:07.70]I'll get it.
[56:07.98]I'll get it.
[56:08.30]I'll get it.
[56:08.60]Are you impressed?
[56:11.56]Oh, we like each other.
[56:12.49]It's a lot of stress.
[56:30.89]Shit.
[56:31.41]I might not do this.
[56:34.82]I can get this one, yeah.
[56:41.78]Die!
[56:43.98]This stress is going way too high.
[56:46.56]Does he have a de-stress?
[56:50.43]Unclear corpses.
[56:51.43]Alright, death blow.
[56:52.57]Let's go.
[56:53.09]Alright, I'll get it.
[56:53.69]I just need to kill this guy.
[56:55.27]Die!
[57:05.68]Die.
[57:05.98]This is it.
[57:10.70]Right here.
[57:11.06]Last move.
[57:12.76]Okay, yeah.
[57:13.34]I got it.
[57:13.66]I'm fine.
[57:14.14]Final round.
[57:14.60]Alright, we got it.
[57:17.66]10% to whatever that is.
[57:20.86]Resistance.
[57:21.68]It's a spawn.
[57:22.36]Dodge.
[57:22.62]Dodge.
[57:34.24]It was a doge token.
[57:36.42]Chance to spawn one doge token each turn.
[57:38.97]I'm... I'm just... Whatever.
[57:43.95]Okay.
[57:44.61]Memories.
[57:45.03]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:45.81]Let's go.
[57:50.81]Hold on.
[57:52.75]Stress.
[57:53.17]Alright, I need to equip combat items, alright?
[58:00.19]This is...
[58:02.80]Negative.
[58:03.26]Okay, very large poison attack.
[58:05.44]Moderate heal.
[58:08.96]Oh, up here.
[58:10.31]Let's give you a... Handage, right?
[58:16.59]Yeah.
[58:16.75]I want to give the Plague Doctor the bomb, right?
[58:24.87]Might as well.
[58:27.47]And then Man-at-Arms will take the...
[58:31.33]Yeah, that's fine.
[58:31.99]Alright.
[58:32.65]Everyone needs to have something.
[58:36.29]Why is the title... Ooh, woo mode?
[58:38.33]I don't know.
[58:40.56]I got... I just... I typed in confidence surges as the enemy crumbles.
[58:45.76]And that's what popped in.
[58:47.44]I don't know.
[58:47.94]I pressed enter.
[58:49.94]Yeah, this is good.
[59:01.72]How far up the line am I?
[59:07.00]Read your title out loud.
[59:08.06]Okay.
[59:10.56]What does it say?
[59:12.98]It says... Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[59:26.17]Plague eaters.
[59:29.74]Not every fight is our fight, so we leave.
[59:34.05]Dagger's sharp.
[59:37.59]Is this where I die?
[59:45.96]Let's do it.
[59:47.76]Oh, I don't like that!
[59:51.16]Let's do it.
[59:51.72]Let's do it.
[59:52.54]They're probably plague resistant, but that's fine.
[59:55.62]There's no... Okay, I've got as much time as I need.
[59:57.80]What's this?
[59:58.60]Consumable by other plague eaters.
[60:03.84]Okay, so they can eat each other?
[60:05.42]They have a bunch of blight resistance, but I'm still going to go for it.
[60:09.26]Because, I mean, it's 50-50 shot, right?
[60:12.84]Alright, we got heal.
[60:16.54]Doesn't she have a buff?
[60:19.85]Ignores defense.
[60:23.64]How much health do you have?
[60:25.40]24?
[60:25.44]Yeah, let's go for it.
[60:34.15]Alright, 50-50 chance.
[60:34.91]Let's go.
[60:37.57]Fuck.
[60:44.68]Remove... I gotta read these.
[60:49.09]these little icons this is crit alright dodge self I feel like I'm reading astrological fucking signs like what is this crit and what's it what was it crit and dodge
[61:08.74]Next skill has a 100% chance to crit.
[61:12.35]And 50% chance for me to dodge my next attack.
[61:15.33]But it removes the blind from them.
[61:19.15]So somebody has to be blinded.
[61:20.27]Okay.
[61:24.85]What is this one?
[61:27.13]Counter attacks the next damaging.
[61:28.51]Okay, so I can go forward.
[61:29.66]Let's do this.
[61:35.22]So now I'll counter attack.
[61:36.26]And then I'm going to move back in.
[61:43.32]Oh, shit.
[61:44.18]Regen.
[61:49.28]No!
[61:49.54]Alright, I gotta use the, uh... I gotta... Hold on.
[61:53.22]Hold the line.
[61:55.78]What the fuck are these symbols?
[61:58.92]Um... Shield and... This is Isaac.
[62:04.16]I just hit escape in Isaac, and I'm like, what the fuck items do I even have?
[62:07.67]Okay.
[62:09.49]Shield and, like, bat thing?
[62:15.83]What kind of shield is that?
[62:17.13]It's a regular shield.
[62:17.99]Take 50% less damage from the next hit.
[62:21.93]Press Alt.
[62:26.19]And it's an immobilize.
[62:30.48]And not move will be moved.
[62:31.66]Alright, I'm... I don't think I want to... I guess I could do that.
[62:34.52]Yeah.
[62:34.94]So I move forward.
[62:38.16]And then... I can't be moved.
[62:42.02]Okay.
[62:49.14]Slippery?
[62:55.80]I probably should just heal.
[62:58.54]Heal 33%?
[62:59.26]Yeah, I have to.
[62:59.92]Let's use it.
[63:07.13]Let's just kill the dogs, right?
[63:09.17]That's probably the best thing to do.
[63:14.17]And then... Ignore... We gotta kill these dogs.
[63:20.98]They can be eaten for regen, right?
[63:22.60]So, I mean, I have to go for it.
[63:23.75]50-50 shot.
[63:27.67]Yeah!
[63:33.27]Oh, what?
[63:35.87]They're goats or something.
[63:36.61]Whatever they are.
[63:38.01]Hmm...
[63:47.81]He's never even seen a goat before.
[63:49.45]This has... Look at... What are you talking about?
[63:50.97]This is a goat.
[63:52.49]Oh, shit.
[63:53.03]That was awesome.
[63:53.73]Alright, good.
[63:59.63]Now you can't do any of this.
[64:00.65]You can't heal.
[64:02.37]Now that I know that, if I see you again, you're dead.
[64:05.60]Oh, that's not good.
[64:06.66]Oh, boy.
[64:11.48]Don't die.
[64:14.42]Anybody have a heal?
[64:15.76]Who has a blight remover?
[64:22.96]Isn't that a heal?
[64:24.44]I swear to God that's a heal.
[64:25.38]I thought it said a heal is like yourself.
[64:26.90]Okay.
[64:32.93]I need to... It wasn't below 33%.
[64:38.75]Okay.
[64:38.87]Okay.
[64:52.67]Under 25%?
[64:55.29]Oh, I am now!
[64:56.13]If a skill can heal, it will show on... Okay, so I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[65:15.44]Um... I'm not gonna use that bomb right now.
[65:20.61]Will this heal?
[65:21.27]Alright, who should I do?
[65:22.17]I gotta do this to you.
[65:26.13]Two bottles of absinthe.
[65:27.43]This person's blasted.
[65:28.83]Oh, yep.
[65:38.06]Heal.
[65:40.84]You can eat the bodies?
[65:42.12]Oh, well, not anymore.
[65:45.92]You should die from the next attack.
[65:54.40]Remember, make sure you put mastery on ounce of prevention.
[65:56.82]That shit will carry you the entire game.
[65:58.44]Okay.
[66:02.23]Anybody have a heal?
[66:04.29]No.
[66:06.27]Really?
[66:08.93]God damn it.
[66:16.00]Alright, die.
[66:18.16]Yes, door!
[66:21.90]Shit!
[66:27.81]Alright, here we go.
[66:30.87]Ounce of prevention is stress heal.
[66:35.29]Okay.
[66:37.77]Ooh.
[66:39.05]Okay, if target is burn, cure is burn.
[66:47.26]Okay, so cure is burn, heals 10% HP.
[66:51.26]I got to put these trinkets on.
[66:56.40]This is a trophy?
[66:57.30]Currency?
[67:00.68]They have baubles.
[67:01.55]Ooh.
[67:01.71]Alright, can somebody... Do we have any heals or anything I can use right now?
[67:09.95]Conditions.
[67:11.49]Relationships.
[67:13.81]I'm bad.
[67:15.03]I need some... Well, you need some stress healing.
[67:17.73]Everyone's kind of getting too high.
[67:19.27]Do I have any stress heals?
[67:25.21]I don't.
[67:30.75]You heal HP as you travel.
[67:40.73]That's useful.
[67:41.24]I think Grave Robber has a heal for destroying corpses.
[67:52.97]Maybe.
[67:55.79]His torch is going down.
[68:02.91]Am I going to scream Slime Rancher 2?
[68:04.71]Oh, you better believe it.
[68:06.63]Trinkets, yep.
[68:07.46]Yeah, right.
[68:07.82]Forgot to put them on.
[68:10.90]Alright, 25% light resistance.
[68:11.92]That's what I want.
[68:13.28]And I want you to be the... Because this is the healer.
[68:16.10]The healer has to be able to stay alive.
[68:20.70]That's it.
[68:26.47]Towering Feast.
[68:29.71]Oh, God.
[68:32.34]quick tactical retreat or retreat is the obvious option there's blood to spill um it's minus 15 torch it's two to one run away
[69:00.97]Torch equals hope.
[69:03.17]I'm running away.
[69:06.47]You wanted to run away too.
[69:07.51]What are you talking about?
[69:10.08]What?
[69:12.30]We should run away.
[69:13.42]Yeah, I agree.
[69:14.30]We should run away.
[69:15.02]Alright, let's run away.
[69:16.28]Hey!
[69:18.08]I didn't want to run away.
[69:19.90]What?
[69:22.85]He wanted to fight.
[69:23.57]Oh no, it was the other guy.
[69:24.51]Sorry, my mistake.
[69:25.41]I just caused drama for no reason.
[69:28.25]He wanted to fight.
[69:28.87]Alright, yeah, I thought it was the other guy.
[69:36.60]I just, like, caused drama.
[69:39.41]Lair?
[69:41.05]Hash or resistance?
[69:42.43]I don't think I'm gonna go to the lair.
[69:45.47]In fact... I'm gonna read what lair is.
[69:52.44]Lairs are where the region bosses dwell.
[69:56.04]To reach the boss, you must first win your way through two sentry battles.
[70:01.04]You may retreat from the lair after each battle, but the further you delve, the more loot you'll retrieve.
[70:05.82]Bosses have rare treasures that can't be found anywhere else.
[70:08.08]I think there's a hospital.
[70:15.40]Oh, shit.
[70:15.78]Okay, that's where you remove quirks.
[70:20.87]I'm not doing that, so we're going to do either a regular fight or I'm just going to go to cash.
[70:24.83]Yeah, there's a lot of supplies.
[70:25.63]Fuck it.
[70:31.09]That's a party wipe if you do that.
[70:32.85]I'm not doing it.
[70:34.51]Wait, didn't I get a mastery point?
[70:38.18]I can't.
[70:38.54]Wait, I have to do that at an end, right?
[70:46.64]Raid wipe.
[70:47.54]Yeah.
[70:47.80]If you guys didn't read the screen that pops up when you open the game, the game gives you a warning.
[70:55.79]Darkest Dungeon is a game where it's very hard and impossible.
[71:00.07]Your characters are going to die all the time.
[71:01.59]Don't get too attached.
[71:02.69]The game is really hard and you're supposed to die over and over again, especially considering if you're in the tutorial, you're probably going to lose your first and second, even third round of the tutorial.
[71:10.79]Be careful.
[71:14.48]In fact, it's a good thing if you die.
[71:19.14]An impressive haul.
[71:21.04]Put it to good use.
[71:22.54]Ooh, what's this?
[71:22.96]Coach upgrade.
[71:24.60]Increases stacking for relics.
[71:26.16]That's actually a big deal.
[71:26.98]-2 stress.
[71:30.89]Minus one stress.
[71:32.37]So, okay, I'm starting to understand how this is working.
[71:35.21]You have all these inn items, and the only way you can really remove stress is at the inn, or with a combat move.
[71:42.07]So I have to essentially just spam this on people when we get to inns.
[71:51.12]Oh, that's... I get it.
[71:52.28]Okay.
[71:53.64]You're gonna stream Elden Ring?
[71:55.46]I don't really play those kinds of games.
[72:00.62]Alright.
[72:03.59]Left or right?
[72:06.05]Left or right?
[72:10.63]One, two, three, four.
[72:11.77]One, two, three, four.
[72:12.80]One, two, three, four.
[72:13.76]One, two, three, four.
[72:14.68]We went right.
[72:24.03]Must you breathe through your mouth?
[72:27.43]We never seem to make any progress.
[72:28.87]What?
[72:29.11]Where was I at the end?
[72:29.91]Enemy ambush.
[72:36.84]Five rounds.
[72:37.56]Alright, what do we got?
[72:39.28]These, everyone can be blighted.
[72:40.74]Perfect.
[72:43.48]That's good.
[72:45.04]These guys are ranged.
[72:45.95]They're usually awful.
[72:46.77]We're going to try to take out that back row.
[72:51.99]Confidence surges as the enemy mouth breathes.
[73:02.84]What are you doing here?
[73:05.48]Why are you here?
[73:06.18]What?
[73:08.26]What are you doing here?
[73:08.92]There's another grenade.
[73:12.54]Oh, it's an ambush.
[73:13.36]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[73:14.62]I actually got to be crumples.
[73:15.48]Yeah, exactly.
[73:16.14]Okay.
[73:18.86]I have to move.
[73:20.75]I don't want you in the front.
[73:21.51]You gotta move back.
[73:22.81]Wait, I have to... Shit.
[73:27.47]Um... Fuck it.
[73:30.63]Fuck!
[73:31.62]What happened?
[73:33.38]What?
[73:34.04]Doesn't that hit everybody?
[73:36.10]What did he just do?
[73:36.72]He just like sprayed him in the face with like... What was that?
[73:42.65]Wasn't that a bomb?
[73:51.29]I thought it was- it's a single target bomb.
[73:53.49]Oh, I thought it hit everybody.
[73:57.78]Oh fuck, this is bad.
[74:14.56]Okay.
[74:15.84]Uh, I have to move forward.
[74:17.24]So, let's get this... Let's do this.
[74:20.34]Please, get back in where you're supposed to be.
[74:24.13]That was a run-ending decision.
[74:26.69]I don't think so.
[74:32.05]That's not even... Whatever.
[74:33.01]That's like a... That helps, actually.
[74:39.35]Now, you'll die from this.
[74:40.45]They'll die from the dots.
[74:43.07]I didn't put the healer in front.
[74:44.77]The healer- I got ambushed and they surged into us which caused us to crumble our perspective on the fight.
[74:57.30]Stop saying things that aren't true.
[75:04.28]He'll die from the dog.
[75:10.07]This first- they're gonna have a heart attack or whatever happens.
[75:18.87]Dot kill, dot kill, just you.
[75:20.81]Oh, fuck.
[75:21.25]That's not a big dot.
[75:21.95]Alright, do you have anything that moves forward?
[75:33.36]This character does, but I don't have the move.
[75:37.46]Alright, you need... It's a heal self.
[75:41.84]Throw the dagger.
[75:42.96]Yeah, let's kill you.
[75:44.53]Oh, please.
[75:53.28]There we go.
[76:01.48]Yeah, it's fine.
[76:02.34]Everyone's dead anyways.
[76:08.18]I'm going to heal though, hopefully.
[76:10.33]Oh, I can't.
[76:10.95]Yeah, whatever.
[76:18.02]Alright, we're good.
[76:21.98]Cool, cool.
[76:23.52]Ooh, +2 crit.
[76:24.33]I want to give that to the, uh, highwayman.
[76:29.61]I'm gonna move the fucking P.D.
[76:34.06]Listen to me.
[76:35.14]We got ambushed, and I got moved around.
[76:40.11]Look, I play Darkest Dungeon 1.
[76:41.26]I know people might come to the stream and just see that the streamer has, like, the plague doctor in the front.
[76:45.72]She's... I didn't... I didn't put her there.
[76:48.68]Press the move button.
[76:50.56]I know, but listen.
[76:51.90]I can... You just relax.
[76:53.12]It's gonna be fine.
[76:59.97]Uh, okay.
[77:00.43]You have... There's no burns so far.
[77:03.83]Okay.
[77:07.98]I want that.
[77:10.35]Or maybe not.
[77:11.69]There is... Ooh.
[77:13.27]No, I want that.
[77:16.54]Nobody's bleeding.
[77:17.20]Yeah, I want you to have the crit.
[77:27.06]I want you to have... Yeah, you take that heal.
[77:31.28]Alright.
[77:32.26]I don't even do the clear corpses thing.
[77:33.80]Give him something better.
[77:39.02]Okay, my target.
[77:39.70]Negative token or if... Combo.
[77:46.98]Okay.
[77:48.68]Triggers additional skill effects when targeted.
[77:53.34]Negative token or if combo removes all negative tokens.
[78:01.95]Their corpses feel so much better in this game.
[78:05.05]I don't like the game so far.
[78:07.37]I don't think I can tell you that.
[78:11.87]I think I have to wait a little while.
[78:13.51]It's too early for me to tell you.
[78:16.19]And if... God damn it, another one of these.
[78:23.30]Alright, well I have... I think I have to fight this.
[78:29.92]We must continue.
[78:30.92]Fall on them quickly.
[78:33.71]Drive them into confusion.
[78:37.33]What is that piece thing down there?
[78:46.54]Stealth?
[78:47.74]Plus one stealth?
[78:53.88]Whatever.
[78:54.29]If I die, I die.
[78:55.57]Who cares?
[78:55.91]Let's go.
[79:02.97]Frenzied enemies.
[79:03.91]What are you doing?
[79:14.96]Okay, this is a maid.
[79:16.40]Plague eater.
[79:16.96]Five.
[79:18.46]Okay, you're very, very resistant to blight.
[79:20.52]Okay, what about in... I don't know what you do, but we're gonna... You get 22 health.
[79:30.49]I'm wondering if this is the same scenario where I have to try to kill these guys first.
[79:33.27]I wonder.
[79:35.82]I wonder.
[79:44.71]Can't give a rating, Andy.
[79:46.25]You can't...
[79:48.91]Hey, it's a it's a Mike Michelson from online entertainment magazine I'm here to review Darkest Dungeon 2 and let me tell you something guys I have 12 minutes in the game and let me tell you it's a 6 I really don't like what they did with it.
[80:03.87]It's a different design just philosophy and choice I actually don't even know what the tokens do I didn't even read half the tutorials yet, but you know I've got about 14 minutes in the game so far So it's a it's a it's a 7 I think wait I have you give me I have to play for like a few hours at least I
[80:26.62]Burger King made the chicken palm sandwich thing you were talking about.
[80:29.88]What?
[80:38.47]Did they really?
[80:41.17]Wait, they made the chicken palm sandwich.
[80:45.67]That's insane.
[80:48.27]It's the heart.
[80:49.59]Vulnerable.
[80:50.23]Okay, move vulnerable.
[80:52.23]And bolster defense.
[80:54.85]I think I'm gonna do it.
[80:58.64]I mean, just might as well do it.
[81:00.10]I can't just, like, press swing at guy.
[81:03.39]Swing at guy.
[81:04.97]No.
[81:05.77]We gotta use the actual other moves.
[81:06.87]Alright.
[81:08.53]I'm also gonna do this.
[81:12.09]I don't... The plague doctor's gonna die.
[81:14.17]You leave me in the wind.
[81:16.49]You have full health.
[81:17.77]Relax.
[81:24.28]Oops.
[81:24.94]That was cool.
[81:28.29]Blinding.
[81:30.16]I think we need to just heal again.
[81:32.56]Yeah.
[81:38.54]Oh, drama.
[81:42.54]Good.
[81:45.74]Though I'm noticing something.
[81:47.07]The stress is only going up by one.
[81:50.42]Before, stress could go up by 10, 5, 20, 15.
[81:52.93]Is it just each one of these is one tick?
[81:58.13]Is that, I think, how I'm seeing it?
[82:01.29]It's just 1 out of 10.
[82:02.67]That's it.
[82:03.25]Okay.
[82:05.63]They're just tokens now.
[82:07.69]Interesting.
[82:09.81]Interesting.
[82:10.13]Okay.
[82:16.26]Damn, that hurt.
[82:22.53]Uhhh... Well, you need to go forward.
[82:23.78]Ah, you don't have the move.
[82:26.90]Alright, well... That's teamwork.
[82:32.42]Sure is.
[82:35.52]Higher stress will make relationships fall apart.
[82:38.91]That's not good.
[82:42.49]What does this do?
[82:43.23]3 to 5?
[82:43.59]5% crit?
[82:47.15]Yeah, I gotta get back.
[82:48.31]This line is all messed up.
[82:55.58]Oh, that was not a good... Is it riposte?
[82:58.14]Riposte?
[83:04.08]How do you say it?
[83:10.19]Riposte.
[83:11.47]Riposte.
[83:16.41]Oh, I can't.
[83:16.99]I'm in the wrong spot here.
[83:17.93]Hmm.
[83:22.21]Hmm.
[83:27.22]This whole line got screwed up.
[83:29.54]Do you have to roll the R?
[83:36.30]For the post?
[83:38.42]They don't.
[83:43.70]Ooh!
[83:53.65]I got spoons.
[83:54.49]I got a super spoon.
[83:56.07]Plus 20% max HP.
[83:58.39]Nice.
[83:58.63]That's going right on him.
[84:01.27]Stimulants?
[84:02.96]Add 1 strength and plus 5 speed for 2 rounds.
[84:05.60]Cool.
[84:08.68]Nice.
[84:09.02]Take it all.
[84:11.80]That's really good for him.
[84:16.99]Over encumbered.
[84:18.95]Oh, you must equip... Yeah, I'm about to equip it right now.
[84:23.97]Where's the trinkets?
[84:30.94]100% max HP, which puts him at 61.
[84:33.18]That's good.
[84:37.10]Alright, I'm running out of space.
[84:41.83]I gotta start to use this... I almost called it crap, but it's not.
[84:46.99]Okay, I gotta start equipping this shit.
[84:48.80]You have to use stuff.
[84:49.50]You can't just hold on to things.
[84:51.64]Even if it's like a bad idea, just use it.
[84:54.64]Bandages, no.
[84:55.44]Give you... This one.
[85:01.67]That's a good light heal.
[85:03.33]Alright, I gotta start using these items.
[85:05.49]Equip the combat items.
[85:06.43]I got them on.
[85:06.87]I just have to use them.
[85:08.89]What?
[85:09.07]26 out of 25.
[85:15.53]Speed bag?
[85:18.09]Whatever.
[85:18.39]I don't even... Just throw it away.
[85:23.93]New Plague Doctor skill.
[85:24.89]I'm begging you, dude.
[85:25.77]Can I... I can't... I have to do that at the end, don't I?
[85:27.59]I don't think I can put this on.
[85:31.29]I think I have to do it at the end.
[85:37.44]You can do it now?
[85:38.14]Oh, I can?
[85:46.78]Shit, okay, I guess yeah, you don't have to be at the end for that.
[85:50.06]This is just an attack buff What am I not I'm gonna get rid of?
[85:53.90]I'll believe this That leaves the blinding gas the heel the resistance buff then whatever this is Bro he's begging you I just did it
[86:18.21]I was also a little confused because it was four abilities in the last game, wasn't it?
[86:22.62]Am I misremembering that?
[86:36.98]God, what is this?
[86:38.04]Alright, this is scary.
[86:40.70]This thing... We gotta get rid of the dog first.
[86:42.26]Alright, it's time to strategize.
[86:44.18]This thing gets eaten by this plague eater lady.
[86:49.35]I can't blight anything here.
[86:50.99]We have to kill this first, because then... Otherwise, she'll heal.

[87:15.26]Eating time.
[87:16.22]Yeah, that's fine.

[87:49.90]Take aim.
[87:50.58]Oh, it's the next attack, not the next move.
[87:52.58]So, technically, if I take aim... I take aim, and then I shoot this guy in the head.
[88:07.42]This is bad.
[88:09.70]Enemies are forced to attack this target.
[88:11.38]Uh-oh, I gotta change that.

[91:57.44]Or should I deal with it last?
[92:01.22]Use poison darts?
[92:02.70]His blight resistance is 85%.
[92:03.70]That's not going to happen.
[92:12.83]Kill it.
[92:21.19]We have to just work together and kill it.
[92:33.52]What?
[92:37.60]I don't think I can kill this in the current... Uh-oh.
[92:39.66]What happens?

[93:00.74]And just leave?
[93:01.92]I don't think I have... I'm not strong enough to kill these guys.
[93:03.84]I think I just have to not die.
[93:11.63]Oh.
[93:15.97]Somebody get heal, please.
[93:18.43]Heal.
[93:19.51]Meltdown.

[93:26.15]Uh...
[93:35.52]Oh, I can't heal.
[93:37.88]He's dead.
[93:39.96]Everyone say goodbye to Cornelius.
[93:42.92]I don't even know what this person's name is.
[93:50.46]Blind and gas.
[93:51.18]Do you have anything to do to stay alive?
[93:58.44]No, just go for the kill.
[93:59.22]I don't care if you die.
[93:59.92]You're going to miss.
[94:02.76]You're going to miss.
[94:03.24]You're going to miss.
[94:04.81]We're good.
[94:11.44]I'm not supposed to be able to win that.
[94:24.78]You are?
[94:25.12]That's not what the intro said.
[94:30.97]The intro clearly said, you're gonna lose your first game at least.
[94:35.13]I just need to get to the inn.
[94:47.90]Ooh.
[94:49.32]Desperate few.
[94:50.01]Okay.
[94:54.67]They want, they want relics.
[94:57.91]Lose relic loot, but you get mixed loot, food loot, and flame.
[95:02.51]Cough up, we're not in the mood for games.
[95:07.27]Let's get loot.
[95:10.63]We can trade with the little we have.
[95:12.59]Lose relic loot, but gain a bunch of other stuff.
[95:19.07]Um...
[95:24.62]So we're giving up our relics for mixed stuff?
[95:33.46]Do I even have enough room for this stuff?
[95:37.97]30 flame seems nice.
[95:38.93]Yeah, it does.
[95:39.49]I'm gonna do it.
[95:45.95]Dismiss?
[95:52.27]I can't.
[95:52.53]How do I dismiss?
[95:55.10]Alright cigarettes and alright so heal and all these at the end If something then removes that They take I don't have enough room for this stuff I Just took that to throw it away
[96:20.99]I just traded for loot and I'm gonna just dump it out of the side of the cart while we drive away.
[96:30.76]Stealth remove is trash.
[96:32.18]Just throw that away.
[96:34.34]Is it?
[96:45.39]Uh.
[96:49.69]Make a little fake fan.
[96:52.78]What are some of the things that I don't care about?
[96:54.38]There are the corpses.
[96:58.98]I don't really use it, but I feel like I'm gonna need to.
[97:01.00]What about the extra storage upgrade?
[97:05.89]Can I do that?
[97:06.39]Damn it.
[97:12.81]Can't do it here?

[97:26.21]Eat the mold.
[97:26.73]I can't.
[97:27.03]I have to eat it at an inn.
[97:29.21]I have to eat it at an inn.
[97:31.27]That's a very weird sentence.
[97:33.07]Eat it at an inn.
[97:41.87]Gamer mold.
[97:50.39]I want to keep the stress stuff because I feel like it's important.
[97:57.36]I'll get rid of this, whatever, moldy fucking streamer slime, whatever this is.
[98:00.26]Hero shrine or supplies?
[98:04.80]Can I continue the... Okay, I'm going to continue the... We're going to do the hero shrine.
[98:09.94]I'm going to do the plague doctor again.
[98:18.08]Ooh, that healed.
[98:30.75]What?
[98:30.95]We have to survive.
[98:34.33]We can't win this.
[98:34.83]I thought I was doing the hero shrine.
[98:39.07]Is this in the way?
[98:42.51]This is really bad.
[98:43.25]I think this might be the end.
[98:44.99]Oh, this is bad.
[98:45.65]This is very bad.
[98:46.69]This is horrible.
[98:53.58]Another meltdown.
[98:54.32]We weren't meant to win.
[98:55.30]We're sacrificial meat.
[98:58.90]Relationship is tested.
[99:01.23]Resentful?
[99:02.03]To Mitulas.
[99:03.41]Um, what does that do?
[99:04.79]What does that do?
[99:05.87]Meltdowns.
[99:38.27]Okay, this is where the relationships tab.
[99:40.71]Timot- Timitula?
[99:41.85]Timitulus?
[99:42.43]Whatever.
[99:42.73]I- I- uh, whatever.
[99:46.79]I don't- I'll figure it out.
[99:51.65]It's random bad effects during combat.
[99:54.66]I'll give it a break.
[99:56.66]You have to move.
[99:57.72]And you're stunned.
[99:58.48]Shit.
[99:59.04]They're dead.
[99:59.94]She's dead.
[100:00.24]It's over.
[100:02.56]Um... Can I last five rounds?
[100:10.67]I don't think I can.
[100:11.67]Bumbling fool.
[100:25.45]Oh, this is not what you intended?
[100:26.80]Wait, they're just in an insult line?
[100:33.03]You tap you on the shoulder.
[100:34.73]Hey, you're a fucking idiot.
[100:37.20]You tap you on the shoulder.
[100:39.42]You smell like B.O.
[100:41.62]You tap you on the shoulder.
[100:43.24]Your breath stinks.
[100:45.60]What is this?
[100:52.71]These have to die.
[100:53.53]I shouldn't have attacked that first.
[100:54.93]Fuck.
[100:55.29]Whatever.
[100:57.15]But you need to move.
[100:58.27]I have to move.
[100:59.09]Is there a forward move?
[100:59.95]No.
[101:00.61]Yeah, there is.
[101:00.97]Okay.
[101:08.58]Tap, tap.
[101:10.24]Worst scream.
[101:11.22]And I go, oh.
[101:14.36]And I go forward.
[101:14.88]I just push the person in front of me into the fucking ocean that's in front of us.
[101:18.96]This is over.
[101:28.33]Hateful.
[101:35.73]hateful they all hate each other everyone just hates each other so alright I I lose this run congratulations you got to this point now we keep all of our items and like upgrade the coach and upgrade the characters I'm how do I do this
[102:08.77]Uh, I think I'd rather have you be alive.
[102:12.83]Okay.
[102:19.75]Um... I could just self-heal.
[102:22.11]Remember, this is the tutorial boss.
[102:27.13]There's no boss here.
[102:30.13]Um, I guess I... I have to kill this guy.
[102:33.49]I have to.
[102:34.25]I could defend you, but at this point... Either I lose or I don't.
[102:47.67]Not bad, huh?
[102:50.37]Oh, they actually like that.
[102:53.65]Let's door again.
[102:58.78]Just heal yourself.
[103:00.82]Oh no, that's not good.
[103:01.86]Don't die.
[103:03.24]Don't die from the Blight.
[103:04.28]Don't die from the Blight.
[103:05.04]You're gonna be fine.
[103:06.28]We just have to last another two rounds.
[103:09.89]This is just edgy Miitopia.
[103:22.42]That's so stupid.
[103:23.50]Like, that's not... I don't... Whatever.
[103:25.69]That's funny what you just said, but it's not.
[103:28.73]It's not true.
[103:30.45]This came out before Miitopia.
[103:36.52]Oh, no.
[103:37.08]There you go.
[103:37.70]Goodbye.
[103:40.40]Take that, you filthy cur.
[103:45.25]You happy that this person died?
[103:46.51]I can maybe last, right?
[104:01.31]Oh, Dismas.
[104:01.95]Yeah, Dismas is dead.
[104:11.61]You can still make it to the shrine.
[104:20.44]You're fucked.
[104:23.58]We were never meant to survive.
[104:24.98]Now what happens?
[104:25.98]Can they double hate each other?
[104:27.20]The end.
[104:29.62]Wait, can I... Hold on, before I lose.
[104:41.51]I need to read the end.
[104:43.03]What does that say?
[104:46.83]The end.
[104:47.69]The expedition ends when all the heroes die.
[104:50.49]Dead heroes remain dead for this entire expedition, but will be available for use again on your next try.
[104:55.68]Wait a minute.
[104:56.08]So they don't leave and they don't get replaced by somebody.
[105:02.68]It's just them again.
[105:07.01]If your hero has died but you have unlocked additional hero classes on your profile, a reinforcement hero will await you at the next inn.
[105:17.49]This replacement hero will be randomly chosen from the classes not selected at the start of the expedition.
[105:21.60]When the journey ends, via victory or defeat, you are awarded hope based upon how well you did.
[105:31.16]Hope is used to increase your profile level.
[105:34.92]Even when an expedition is surely lost, it's often worth pressing on to get more hope.
[105:42.20]Hopium.
[105:42.60]Oh, a zero hope run.
[105:45.90]As you accrue hope and increase your profile level, new heroes, items, and quirks become unlocked.
[105:55.53]These unlocks make future expeditions easier and also give you more opportunities to develop personal strategies for conquering the mountain.
[106:01.97]Yes, I'm just supposed to lose.
[106:04.88]interesting okay so should I just try to you just have to go as far as you possibly can you and your roguelikes you knew this didn't you not really trying to stay alive right now okay uh I can't even heal great
[106:36.49]I mean, they all have light resistance.
[106:39.43]I'm just gonna have to do this.
[106:41.09]Whatever, just try to stay alive.
[106:45.01]If you survive this fight, discard your entire inventory.
[106:48.34]Why would I do that?
[106:56.56]Or hope?
[106:57.24]What?
[107:00.62]You do it for hope?
[107:01.85]How is that hope?
[107:05.52]Hey guys, the expedition's not going well.
[107:08.81]Throw all of our supplies out the window.
[107:11.87]What?
[107:18.01]I'm gonna make it.
[107:19.17]At least one more.
[107:24.09]It's fake confidence.
[107:33.70]Oh shit, he retaliated and almost killed him.
[107:37.12]Alright, we're done.
[107:37.72]Round five of five.
[107:38.66]That's it.
[107:40.44]Watching you disgusts me.
[107:41.90]Okay.
[107:47.59]Um... Alright, we made it.
[108:02.78]Slippery.
[108:04.90]Okay.
[108:07.98]So you tell me to throw all my items in the trash?
[108:11.40]Just discard everything?
[108:15.32]Where are we on the map?
[108:17.23]22 leagues to the inn.
[108:20.23]I discard.
[108:23.45]Yes, discard items.
[108:24.51]Discard all.
[108:26.31]But I... You get more points by throwing out all your items.
[108:32.02]It's...
[108:37.25]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[108:38.21]Hero shrine and then unknown.
[108:44.53]This is a huge joke.
[108:45.67]Yeah, I'm not.
[108:46.53]I don't.
[108:47.03]I'm not going to do that.
[108:53.46]You liar.
[108:59.22]Throw your entire inventory away.
[109:03.70]Get out of here.
[109:06.19]That's unbelievable that you would even suggest that.
[109:13.40]Read the tutorial.
[109:14.74]No.
[109:17.14]Map.
[109:17.68]Scouting.
[109:20.32]Inventory.
[109:21.62]Full inventory.
[109:23.66]Items cannot be sold, so throw away what you don't need.
[109:26.05]Discarding items... Oh shit.
[109:40.89]Not another ambush, right?
[109:41.95]Come on.
[109:42.63]What the fuck is this bullshit?
[109:44.21]This is two- What?
[109:45.25]How do I run?
[109:46.43]This is like a brand new enemy type with like super powerful moves.
[109:49.91]What am I supposed to do?
[109:55.56]Your torch is at zero.
[109:58.26]Oh, well, shit.
[109:59.06]How am I- Can we run?
[110:02.58]I- I guess start- stay alive-
[110:19.99]It's not over.
[110:20.43]I mean, it probably is over.
[110:25.68]Um.
[110:29.22]I think it's over.
[110:29.98]No, there's no round one out of five.
[110:32.38]You have to kill them.
[110:33.48]It's over.
[110:33.74]We're dead.
[110:38.49]There's also no round timer.
[110:40.25]Oh, shit.
[110:41.17]It's over.
[110:49.88]28?
[110:50.02]God damn it.
[110:54.29]It's never over, Hopium.
[110:59.73]That's right.
[111:02.40]That's right, Weasley!
[111:07.94]It's not over!
[111:09.22]It's never over!
[111:18.84]That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.
[111:24.94]My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.
[111:34.33]He never yelled.
[111:35.17]It was like...
[111:47.66]I don't remember that noise.
[111:48.46]Go watch the entire series again.
[111:50.60]You'll hear it like 15 times.
[111:52.36]I loved it.
[111:53.66]I loved that noise.
[111:56.91]Like at one point I had that noise as a ringtone.
[112:24.14]There's no sounds like that in the entire Harry Potter script.
[112:27.68]I am not going to get gas from Saw again.
[112:31.80]I'm sorry.
[112:33.06]That happens a shitload of times.
[112:35.44]Voldemort makes that exact noise at least three times over the course of the series.
[112:41.95]This is not going to be the same scenario.
[112:44.79]Trust me.
[112:45.43]You'll see.
[112:53.62]Yeah, and now why is weird Voldemort sound gonna be in the Harry Potter script?
[113:00.28]He just downplayed 15 to 3.
[113:01.58]This is a negotiation, okay?
[113:32.64]Oh.
[113:32.92]Oh.
[113:33.10]Okay.
[114:10.20]Why did somebody make a compilation?
[114:16.43]Somebody made a compilation of all the awkward grunts and yells from Voldemort.
[114:22.80]This is a sick ringtone.
[114:25.38]That's not the one.
[114:25.92]I gotta find the one I'm thinking of.
[114:40.45]There it is!
[114:41.51]They're like, yeah!
[114:50.18]See?
[114:54.04]That's not even half the video.
[114:58.18]You made this video for this joke.
[114:59.98]I did not.
[115:00.40]This video has like 400,000 views.
[115:02.89]If I made this video like a day ago, no way, it wouldn't have gotten that many.
[115:08.44]You go play the sounds that I just made.
[115:13.69]The ones I just made.
[115:16.19]Play them.
[115:17.25]I want to hear it.
[115:17.99]Clip it.
[115:18.33]I want to hear it.
[115:18.76]I want to hear them back to back.
[115:29.27]I win.
[115:29.91]I win this argument.
[115:37.59]That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.
[115:43.71]My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.
[115:49.74]Like what?
[115:53.08]He never yelled.
[115:53.94]It was like... That's my favorite part about Harry Potter.
[116:18.28]It's not it's close Yes, it is that's what I did and I didn't even play the rest of the video there's more
[116:44.50]Thanks for watching!
[116:56.50]it's it's homer simpson it's not homer simpson
[117:26.13]Oh, hold on.
[117:28.12]That's so stupid.
[117:29.26]It's, but it's, Voldemort was such a crazy character.
[117:34.68]It was a great villain.
[117:40.93]Like, it was very well acted.
[117:42.31]It was like, it was great.
[117:45.41]But, I mean, I can't.
[118:05.61]I'm never going to be able to think of anything else.
[118:10.96]I will never be able to think of anything else ever again besides Homer Simpson.
[118:15.78]Ugh.
[118:24.64]But Ralph Fiennes is such an amazing actor.
[118:28.02]Like, unbelievable fucking actor.
[118:30.16]Unbelievable.
[118:30.92]Like, un-fucking-believable.
[118:33.34]It just ruined everything.
[118:36.00]It just ruined everything for me.
[118:38.16]I can't... Okay, let's just lose already.
[118:49.72]You said Ralph?
[118:50.60]I've...
[118:55.67]Wait, what did I say?
[119:02.27]What did I say?
[119:06.32]Did I call him Ralph?
[119:15.90]It's... Whatever.
[119:19.12]You know what I'm talking about.
[119:24.81]Jesus.
[119:27.37]The actor is... Yeah.
[119:30.38]Okay, turn this volume back up before I fucking puke.
[119:37.28]Ay yi yi.
[119:41.18]Okay, can I... I'm not gonna be able to blast this at all.
[119:44.43]I just have to lose.
[119:54.84]If she does this, that's unbelievable.
[120:03.79]I know.
[120:04.33]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[120:06.31]You get it now.
[120:07.11]Finally.
[120:15.34]It's so much better than a regular stream.
[120:17.64]It's... I love it.
[120:19.94]I wouldn't be talking about it if it wasn't my favorite thing.
[120:31.25]It's a spell.
[120:31.94]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[120:35.32]I just leveled up.
[120:36.32]Okay, so they already died.
[120:37.22]I got to level two.
[120:37.86]Minus 50% healing received from skills round start.
[120:41.54]Rewards.
[120:41.90]Got trinkets.
[121:01.28]And I got some... I... Reduces... Reduces Flapjacks.
[121:04.84]Everybody likes Flapjacks.
[121:07.96]Rare?
[121:08.24]Okay.
[121:15.07]So now what?
[121:18.01]We just go again.
[121:22.75]Do I have the same party?
[121:24.91]Wait, do I have the same team?
[121:30.45]We travel through the incalculable dimensions of human weakness.
[121:41.88]Oh.
[121:42.88]We just... No comfort awaits you here.
[121:47.24]This game is just a road trip with a bunch of arguing kids.
[121:49.30]You're a coward in your crumbling denial.
[121:51.87]Long enough.
[122:01.02]So, what does a pancake upgrade just heal?
[122:03.25]I need, okay, I need profile level three to unlock the hellion.
[122:14.09]Where's my, where's the abomination?
[122:15.03]That's my favorite.
[122:17.07]Um, uh, I'm just making sure I understand here.
[122:23.72]Where's the abomination?
[122:33.97]Alright, the Leper's here.
[122:35.47]Leper is second favorite.
[122:42.32]I actually would probably say Leper's probably my favorite character to play with.
[122:46.28]Abomination's my favorite, like, lore-wise character.
[122:50.24]I loved the Abomination.
[122:51.98]Needing to decide when you were going to turn, and everybody kind of freaks out, but you know you're really powerful.
[122:56.38]I loved that.
[123:01.68]Okay, so it's just the same team.
[123:06.10]Are these the same people?
[123:07.66]Um.
[123:07.82]Hold on.
[123:12.97]Did they hate each other still?
[123:14.35]Did they come back to life?
[123:15.29]Or are these different people?
[123:27.26]Master of the Sprawl's advantages.
[123:29.48]Sprawl.
[123:30.76]Knowledge supreme over all.
[123:32.12]Okay.
[123:39.69]They don't die, it just loops.
[123:41.57]No, relationships reset.
[123:42.83]Your skill unlock progression stays.
[123:44.61]Okay.
[123:46.17]I know you're thinking about the Voldemort scream.
[123:47.99]I'm going to be thinking about it for a month.
[123:49.87]Every day.
[123:50.19]Okay, this is the team we're going to use, so I'm going to go to the inn now, right?
[124:01.06]And equip the stuff.
[124:06.82]Upgrade ounce of prevention this time.
[124:12.90]Harry Potter Public Domain Night.
[124:16.84]Well, if I said Harry Potter Public Domain Movie Night, that is just a lie in the title.
[124:24.05]And then I would get a cease and desist sent to my... What do you want me to do?
[124:32.61]I would get cease and desisted.
[124:33.67]An impressive haul.
[124:38.75]Put it to good use.
[124:40.90]Okay, so we're taking all this shit Now I need to get to the okay, we're going to the inn let's equip some shit Your insightful questions during my lectures gave me pause just countersuit them recognized in you something of a kindred spirit
[125:06.39]Okay, yeah, sure.
[125:08.59]Let me get this straight.
[125:09.15]You want me to counter-sue Warner Brothers if I do that?
[125:14.17]Or... What?
[125:16.82]What, like, damages?
[125:20.46]Guys, my lawyer that would go to the proceedings wouldn't even have a tie-on.
[125:30.92]I would get screwed.
[125:33.91]What are you talking about?
[125:34.61]It'd be over.
[125:43.05]Okay.
[125:44.49]So.
[125:46.75]All these are the same.
[125:47.95]These are all the same thing.
[125:51.91]Food reward.
[125:52.55]They're just food and flame.
[125:54.35]I guess we're going to do just whoever.
[125:55.81]It doesn't matter.
[125:56.53]Yeah.
[126:01.95]That would be good content.
[126:06.33]I mean, it would be the talk of the internet, I think, for a little while.
[126:11.43]And not in the way that I think everybody thinks.
[126:13.46]It wouldn't be funny.
[126:14.16]It'd be like, this streamer is a fucking idiot.
[126:16.68]And it's gonna lose everything.
[126:18.92]I guess maybe there'd be enough, like, Reddit comments for people to laugh about, like, how stupid that was for me to do.
[126:26.65]Like, I streamed the Harry Potter series and countersued them when they, like, said, don't do that.
[126:33.99]That's illegal.
[126:36.25]And I would be like, no, it's not.
[126:40.62]That'd be funny for a week until everyone forgot that I did that and nobody cared anymore Yeah, like that would be everyone would talk about that for like a week and then I would go to jail and everyone just move on Pardon get a pardon
[127:08.87]Doesn't work like that.
[127:11.04]It doesn't work like that.
[127:13.96]A week is a long time.
[127:15.06]Uh, let's do this.
[127:19.70]Actually, no.
[127:24.65]You guys have Blight Resistance?
[127:25.53]You do.
[127:25.83]Let's just play.
[127:30.19]You're gonna miss.
[127:30.63]What?
[127:33.03]What?
[127:37.83]Would you recommend this game?
[127:41.15]I don't know.
[127:44.03]I don't know.
[127:44.61]I still don't know.
[127:55.76]Do the character stories.
[127:56.64]I did the plague doctor.
[128:04.11]Oh, you have... How much damage is this doing?
[128:06.19]Two?
[128:06.39]Alright, we'll throw... Just throw a knife.
[128:09.59]We'll die from the bleed.
[128:10.35]Okay, that's fine.
[128:12.67]And you're gonna shoot and crit this guy in the head.
[128:22.92]Uh, go for it.
[128:23.40]Come on.
[128:25.34]Nice.
[128:28.06]Excellent.
[128:36.77]You stream for two hours and you don't even know?
[128:38.81]Well, I mean, two hours in a game that you could probably sit here and spend a hundred is like 2% of the game time you'll have here.
[128:51.70]Would you be willing to listen to somebody that has like 1% game time?
[128:58.01]I don't know about that.
[128:58.71]Would you trust me?
[129:11.05]I mean, it's very simple for me to say it's too different.
[129:12.87]I don't like it.
[129:14.29]Right?
[129:15.55]But that's not necessarily the case.
[129:18.16]I'm starting to understand what they're doing with this one.
[129:21.80]I'm starting to understand the practice here.
[129:25.14]But no abomination, no buy.
[129:31.33]I already bought it.
[129:32.19]But you know what I mean.
[129:32.97]Thank you.
[129:40.94]Okay, so everyone's friendly.
[129:43.08]This is where I have to do stuff, right?
[129:46.00]Improving affinity.
[129:47.62]So I should just use these.
[129:49.50]Is there any downside to using these?
[129:51.40]All of these?
[129:52.84]Why would I?
[129:53.22]Let's use it on Audrey.
[129:56.45]I won't cheat this time.
[129:57.37]What just happened?
[130:10.63]Did it work?
[130:15.11]Lightship is tested.
[130:15.81]Ooh, inseparable.
[130:18.29]What did that do?
[130:23.17]They're inseparable.
[130:24.05]What does that mean?
[130:31.35]I don't get to keep those inventory upgrades.
[130:33.80]They're friends now.
[130:34.94]Okay.
[130:39.34]Um, how long have I been streaming for?
[130:41.96]Have I really been streaming for two hours?
[130:48.32]Holy shit.
[130:49.18]I've been streaming for two hours.
[130:56.61]Wow.
[130:57.05]Okay.
[130:58.21]Uh, I'll take a free break.
[130:58.99]Yeah.
[130:59.33]I'll be, I'll be right back.
[131:02.71]See you in like two minutes.
[134:00.01]I got lost.
[134:06.14]Eight minute piss.
[134:17.03]Had to go through his maze.
[134:21.03]Okay, let's, let's go.
[134:22.11]Let's do it.
[134:25.65]So I've got, how many points do I have?
[134:27.88]One point.
[134:32.92]I feel like I don't want to just upgrade one person, though.
[134:36.20]What does this do?
[134:46.26]Ounce of prevention.
[134:47.14]Target.
[134:47.78]Is that minus one what?
[134:53.32]Is that minus one... What icon is that?
[134:56.28]Is minus one stress?
[134:59.12]Oh, that's good.
[135:01.86]Yeah.
[135:02.02]Yeah.
[135:04.31]I feel like that's almost required.
[135:05.69]That's kind of required.
[135:09.64]Remember, what is your blood type?
[135:15.86]It's for a school project.
[135:18.78]Um... I don't even know.
[135:25.99]You know, every time I've ever had my blood tested, I've always in the back of my mind said, you know, I want to ask him.
[135:31.11]I keep forgetting to ask him, but I never ask them.
[135:34.94]It's something that I'm always curious about, but I just don't, I don't know.
[135:40.68]And every time I go to the doctor and it's like time for some blood work, remember to ask about, hey, what's my blood type?
[135:51.87]I don't do it.
[135:57.43]Alright.
[135:57.83]Oh, so now this is a stress heal.
[135:58.83]That's good.
[135:59.26]So, okay.
[136:01.64]Okay.
[136:03.35]Like, route?
[136:03.79]What about... No, no, no.
[136:04.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[136:04.91]Anything else I can do?
[136:06.07]You get to keep your trinkets, too, don't you?
[136:10.23]I'm gonna put these on.
[136:16.77]Uh, where's... Provisioner.
[136:18.56]Hmm.
[136:24.30]I feel like I probably need some of these.
[136:29.60]I mean, these are just very obviously... Just get... Aren't those... This is just, like, kind of food, right?
[136:34.55]I mean, I'm just gonna... I want a shitload of them.
[136:36.25]Should I not have done that?
[136:36.91]I always overbuy everything in these games.
[136:47.26]Could you tuck me into bed?
[136:48.34]Yeah, sure.
[136:53.34]Just hold on... One, two... Ah!
[136:55.96]Ah!
[136:57.93]Well, you hit the ground, but I was aiming for the bed.
[137:02.85]Sorry.
[137:08.45]I think this is fine.
[137:14.80]Bat country or corrupting?
[137:20.12]Bat country.
[137:24.94]Isn't one of my characters good at this?
[137:27.84]Alright, minus three stress.
[137:35.26]I should probably give this to somebody, right?
[137:39.16]Yeah, I'm going to give this to you.
[137:43.33]And somebody has to put this shit on.
[137:45.97]20% blight resistance and bleed resist.
[137:52.63]Who do I want to make sure has that?
[138:02.63]Who should have that?
[138:03.41]Probably the plague doctor?
[138:04.41]Yeah.
[138:08.09]The healer has to have the most resistance, right?
[138:11.63]I think that's very important.
[138:15.85]Speaking of heals, I want people that don't have a heal to be able to use heals.
[138:19.51]Looks fine.
[138:22.77]You can take the... No, I'll give it to you.
[138:28.20]I think I'm ready to go.
[138:31.65]Like, Darkstar already has high plague resistance.
[138:33.99]Oh, yeah.
[138:34.29]We want to make sure it's impossible.
[138:35.37]What's my favorite soup?
[138:39.80]Uh... Broccoli cheddar.
[138:41.04]Tomato basil.
[138:45.28]Uh... French onion.
[138:50.32]Um... Yeah, that's probably it.
[138:54.10]Chicken noodle.
[138:57.78]Mistrone.
[138:59.66]Yeah.
[139:03.90]Alright, let's just go.
[139:04.76]I'm kind of stressed, but whatever.
[139:06.64]I have the stress heal now.
[139:09.38]Anything else I need to do?
[139:10.28]I'm still trying to get the hang of this.
[139:14.65]What is this?
[139:15.15]Is this some kind of, um... Was this some kind of thing, or what?
[139:21.45]Is this some kind of thing, or what?
[139:23.09]I don't understand.
[139:25.45]Oops, wrong button.
[139:27.81]Is this some kind of thing, or what?
[139:32.39]Is this some kind of **** thing?
[139:34.05]I don't know.
[139:44.13]Alright, I'm sorry about that.
[139:46.11]I don't know why.
[139:46.55]I don't know why I just did that.
[139:47.59]But whatever.
[139:48.09]Embark.
[139:48.52]I don't know why I just did that.
[139:51.34]I'm sorry.
[139:53.80]I can't be trusted with a microphone.
[139:55.34]I'm the fucking guy that if you hand a microphone to me, I'm just gonna put it up to my mouth and be like...
[140:02.30]And, like, production's gonna be like, cut that person's mic, that person's fucking, what are they doing?
[140:06.07]I'm sorry.
[140:14.71]You put a camera on me, and I'll give me a mic.
[140:17.87]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do, I'm just gonna start talking.
[140:22.51]If you really want to keep me occupied, just have a microphone in a corner.
[140:27.88]It doesn't even need to be plugged into anything.
[140:31.95]And just, you know, sort of allow me... Just plug me into a corner and just sort of... Just sort of allow me to get on the microphone here and just start going.
[140:46.42]Yeah, give me a microphone and I'll do anything.
[140:48.72]Hey, how you doing, everybody?
[140:49.54]How are you?
[140:50.00]Good to see you again.
[140:51.14]Okay, okay, okay.
[140:53.12]Oh, yeah, we got somebody in the crowd over here.
[140:54.42]Looks like they are... Hey, you two together?
[140:56.71]You sure are.
[140:57.53]You sure are.
[140:57.89]Hey, when was the last time you guys went to Target?
[140:59.89]Just give me a microphone.
[141:01.01]All you have to do is give me a mic and I'll just do this.
[141:05.35]You just sit me in the corner.
[141:07.83]Just give me a microphone that I can talk into.
[141:13.03]I'll be there for four hours.
[141:16.04]I'm the easiest child to take care of.
[141:23.21]Cut his mic, cut his mic, cut his mic, cut his mic, cut his mic.
[141:27.35]What, you didn't think that I had on hand a microphone that I could just talk into and say hello to you?
[141:36.84]Oh no, we're currently, I'm currently in the stratosphere.
[141:41.48]You give me a microphone that has like funny sounds on it and that's all I have to do is just talk into it and say how you doing, ladies and gentlemen, how are you?
[141:48.00]Put the facecam on?
[141:48.78]Oh shit, I have to- Does everybody stay there?
[141:53.71]Don't move.
[141:54.45]I was gonna turn the facecam on, but I don't have any clothes on.
[141:56.82]Wait.
[143:14.24]Okay.
[143:14.36]Come back.
[143:22.41]All you gotta do, I'm serious.
[143:33.93]All you gotta do is give me access to a microphone.
[143:36.65]Hey, who got back there in the chat room?
[143:41.30]Hey, okay, okay.
[143:47.86]I don't know why I have it.
[143:51.98]Oops.
[143:55.82]Nice sweater?
[143:56.52]Nice sweater, nerd?
[143:59.40]Hey, uh, like I have, are all students welcome?
[144:02.87]No!
[144:03.21]What are you talking about?
[144:05.43]All students, welcome to the assembly.
[144:08.35]Uh, we just want to make sure everyone's aware that the, uh, school lunches are gonna be changed this week.
[144:15.39]We're going to be having meat pie instead of sandwich day.
[144:20.76]I know that's a disappointment to everybody, but I just want to make sure that everybody's aware.
[144:26.36]And is there a reason why?
[144:29.06]all mics sound like this when you're at school?
[144:33.68]I don't get it.
[144:35.12]It's like $15.
[144:35.92]It's like probably $50 total to get a microphone that doesn't sound like this.
[144:42.65]It's the speakers.
[144:44.07]Maybe it has to be.
[144:44.87]I look deranged today.
[144:46.51]Why do I look so deranged today?
[144:50.09]Alright.
[144:50.89]This is what we're going to do.
[144:55.19]Fuck yeah.
[144:55.93]You ready?
[144:58.72]Everyone's gonna be... Hold on.
[145:04.72]Okay.
[145:07.10]I'm gonna pretend that my mic broke.
[145:09.14]And I'm using a different mic.
[145:14.06]Everybody be in on this shit.
[145:24.41]This is the last thing that I typed in.
[145:32.13]Ow, that hurt.
[145:39.60]You know, how many times have I done the, like, write on text a description thing?
[145:44.02]Okay.
[146:00.77]And I'm going to be unintelligible, and I want people to be fucking furious.
[146:04.07]Remember, this is just for like the ten people that show up in like five minutes.
[146:11.53]For nobody else.
[146:12.05]Okay, uh, I want a different color though.
[146:22.56]I want this, I don't want the, oh there we go.
[146:34.28]You ready?
[146:44.40]Okay.
[146:45.14]Hold on.
[146:45.42]I need to take my shirt off real quick.
[146:47.65]Hold on.
[146:59.08]Okay.
[146:59.44]There we go.
[147:01.54]Okay.
[147:04.21]Okay, so... Okay.
[147:11.01]Okay.
[147:12.23]So, I'm going to... I'm going to go for it.
[147:14.43]I'm trying to get over here.
[147:18.01]This is fucking stupid.
[147:19.01]I fucking hate this.
[147:22.93]Move it away from here, bro.
[147:27.41]I haven't cleaned this.
[147:35.16]I have to make do, guys.
[147:36.10]You can't just... Okay.
[147:57.92]Alright, so I'm going... I'm going to start going.
[148:01.52]I'm going to start moving forward here, so...
[148:05.27]Let's go.
[148:07.87]I can't fix the mic.
[148:09.11]The mic is fucked up.
[148:09.96]I can't do it.
[148:11.06]My mic is screwed up.
[148:11.82]I have to use this one.
[148:20.53]Should I go left, right, or straight?
[148:22.11]Where should I go?
[148:25.65]Fix it, fix it, fix it.
[148:27.39]There's nothing I can do to fix it.
[148:28.57]I can't.
[148:31.10]I can't, don't you get it?
[148:32.60]I can't.
[148:33.60]The mic that I was using just broke and it doesn't work anymore.
[148:38.59]I have to get a new one eventually, but you have to deal with this for now.
[148:41.41]Sorry, what the fuck?
[148:44.87]Sometimes, like, you guys don't understand, like, fucking technical problems, seriously.
[148:47.78]Some of you guys, like, seriously need to shut the fuck up.
[148:49.48]It's fucking annoying.
[148:53.56]I'm not gonna turn the stream off, I'm gonna just continue to do what I do.
[148:56.84]Stop being so fucking irritating.
[149:02.36]Okay.
[149:03.50]So if I go this way, I'm going to go straight just to get the chest.
[149:11.64]You stand.
[149:12.12]If I don't put it close to my face, you're not going to be... Right next to my mouth.
[149:21.17]I can't take it away from my mouth.
[149:23.05]If I take it away...
[149:31.51]idiot you are a fucking idiot if you think that I could do that just let me enjoy the game while we deal with the technical issues stop streaming stop streaming okay no what is what I don't know I just pressed it I don't know what just did something whatever okay let's go this way for a fight
[149:57.18]I think there's a fight this way if I go straight down.
[149:58.72]Even worse?
[149:59.42]Your mic actually sounds better.
[150:00.42]Fix the echo.
[150:00.86]Some of you guys seriously don't understand what I'm saying.
[150:04.50]And I have the nerve for that.
[150:24.66]I can have a cash, this is pretty good.
[150:26.06]We should be able to afford this.
[150:30.16]Affording this is not real necessarily, but I'm really trying to look for it now.
[150:37.24]Although some of this is quintessentially the Plague Doctor, I think so.
[150:55.71]Fucking annoying.
[150:58.99]The most annoying thing is this is like a $7,000 mic and for some reason I can't find it.
[151:09.10]Piss me off.
[151:15.40]I need a pop filter.
[151:16.86]Just wait, hold on.
[151:18.04]I need to play the video game, everybody stop talking!
[151:23.18]Okay.
[151:24.38]I have to put the controller down so I can play the game.
[152:00.11]What's the problem?
[152:00.99]What's going on?
[152:04.47]Aaron!
[152:11.02]That's a good... You're right, I can... Aaron!
[152:13.92]Aaron!
[152:14.60]Aaron!
[152:15.30]Aaron!
[152:16.30]No, run away!
[152:17.60]Aaron!
[152:18.60]Aaron!
[152:21.12]I almost just shit my pants when I did that.
[152:24.06]I actually almost just shit my pants for real.
[152:25.50]I'm not kidding.
[152:25.90]That was actually almost... I almost shit my pants right now.
[152:28.66]On... Thank God it wasn't on camera.
[152:32.47]I need to go wash my mouth.
[152:33.29]I'll be back.
[152:33.83]Like, I don't know what... I've never washed this before.
[152:36.59]I have to put this all over my mouth.
[152:37.55]I'll be right back.
[152:37.93]I have to wash my mouth.
[152:50.15]Thanks for watching!
[153:27.13]I don't know.
[154:10.95]Do you guys have any idea how many times I've brought that mic to a party and turned the echo on and farted into it?
[154:19.02]To be the funny guy at the party?
[154:24.02]Are you serious?
[154:26.26]What else would I use that for?
[154:41.95]Oh my god, that's incredibly funny.
[154:54.43]What the fuck?
[154:55.42]What?
[154:56.40]You don't know what I'm talking about?
[154:57.56]Whatever.
[155:05.12]I want...
[155:09.54]Oh, this would be a great time to do... I'm gonna play the game now.
[155:14.22]I'm gonna relax.
[155:33.53]Alright, this does four.
[155:36.47]Oh, what you love when you see perfect shit like that.
[155:39.63]This is gonna die from the fucking blight.
[155:48.41]Stunned.
[155:56.99]You're gonna move.
[156:00.01]You gotta get out of there.
[156:00.83]Okay.
[156:04.91]Finishing blow?
[156:05.59]What the hell?
[156:13.85]Okay, they got like five turns each.
[156:15.19]What's going on here?
[156:20.70]Um... I gotta take the person out in the back.
[156:26.26]Really?
[156:34.90]Oh shit, the text on the screen.
[156:38.76]How is this a different mic?
[156:43.97]Is this Cure?
[156:44.61]Bleed?
[156:45.25]No.
[156:53.82]Flame.
[157:06.23]You threw the run when you missed the hit.
[157:08.45]I don't think that's accurate.
[157:21.24]Is this defense for everybody?
[157:22.22]Yeah, is this for everybody?
[157:26.82]I think it is, right?
[157:30.59]Is it not?
[157:31.71]Just for me?
[157:33.17]Oh.
[157:35.20]is this guy talking yeah I've been talking whoa oh that's their perk they're inseparable right okay cool
[158:05.88]Dead.
[158:10.76]Good defense.
[158:11.74]Alright, is it defense or defense?
[158:16.16]How much defense do you have?
[158:17.28]How much defense do you have?
[158:18.94]Which one do you think?
[158:20.84]What are you guys thinking?
[158:26.97]Defense?
[158:28.17]Defense?
[158:28.53]I think it depends.
[158:37.29]If defense is the only word, or one of two words, or three words, it's defense.
[158:42.73]If defense is in the middle of a sentence, it's defense.
[158:47.92]You didn't have enough... No, my defense was too low.
[158:53.88]I say defense.
[158:54.44]Yeah, it's defense.
[158:55.24]Alright, let's do the stress heal on you.
[159:03.97]Wait, it's on everybody.
[159:05.79]Holy shit.
[159:06.99]That is a must-have.
[159:08.01]I thought it was just one person.
[159:12.97]That should be the first thing you buy ever in the game.
[159:17.31]There's no reason to ever buy another move first.
[159:20.19]Come on.
[159:35.63]That's mandatory.
[159:36.45]Yeah, it has to be.
[159:40.47]Did I actually not kill him?
[159:48.57]Cultist encounter.
[159:49.35]Alright, we're gonna do the cultist encounter.
[159:50.45]How's everybody doing?
[159:53.68]You good?
[159:54.54]Everybody alright?
[159:57.42]Inseparable.
[160:00.90]Cool.
[160:03.34]Combat skills.
[160:07.56]Uh, you still have that.
[160:08.48]If target stress or stress less than 0% cures... Okay, you know, I really kind of feel like they don't need this first line of text.
[160:22.27]That first line of text is almost confusing for some reason.
[160:26.27]If target stress or stress greater than 0%, why isn't it just cures 1% stress?
[160:38.22]It's two separate things.
[160:44.06]But it's not, though.
[160:45.12]This is horror, not stress.
[160:55.11]So if targets horror, so if their horror is above 0%, or their stress is above 0%, then it cures horror and one stress.
[161:03.69]It just feels really weirdly worded.
[161:09.04]Like, here's horror and minus one stress.
[161:11.64]Well, whatever.
[161:16.01]Garlic brain.
[161:16.81]It's not a garlic brain.
[161:19.19]It's like showing your work.
[161:21.33]Well, I don't think you need to show your work.
[161:28.43]What's that?
[161:36.18]What is this?
[161:36.90]Oblivion's Ingress.
[161:40.93]Oh, Lord.
[161:41.67]What does this mean?
[161:45.54]We advance.
[161:46.38]Relentless, they'll perish.
[161:48.36]Strength and... Or escape.
[161:50.62]Let's go.
[161:56.26]Leadership is tested?
[161:57.26]What, you don't like each other anymore?
[161:58.22]Ooh, respectful.
[161:59.47]Okay, so they all actually like each other.
[162:10.66]Okay.
[162:13.28]So, spawn encounters.
[162:14.80]What are the inseparable?
[162:15.86]Take my hand.
[162:17.44]Well, okay.
[162:21.26]So... 28.
[162:24.44]These guys probably need to go first because they probably do something weird.
[162:28.25]All their blight resistance is pretty low.
[162:31.65]Let's get that started.
[162:39.15]Good.
[162:42.20]Are you eating baby back ribs on today's stream?
[162:44.52]I'm not eating baby back ribs ever.
[162:48.34]Tracking shot.
[162:50.36]Requires that the target has... Dodge increase.
[162:54.06]Ignores the dodge.
[162:55.38]And removes the dodge.
[162:59.11]Is that good?
[162:59.53]I guess, maybe?
[163:03.61]I guess?
[163:04.41]I don't know.
[163:09.07]Nice.
[163:16.19]I'm just going to keep using this over and over again.
[163:17.71]Tomorrow's stream is the public domain movie night.
[163:26.52]I'm not doing like eat ribs on stream.
[163:32.14]This horror.
[163:32.62]I have that thing.
[163:34.59]I didn't even equip it.
[163:44.35]What does horror really do?
[163:45.63]Because it's probably different in this game than the last game, right?
[163:54.49]Where is it?
[163:58.58]They're not on here?
[164:03.90]It's the same, stress each dot.
[164:05.14]Okay, it's the same.
[164:05.76]Alright.
[164:06.34]Good to know.
[164:08.16]Let's stack the dot.
[164:10.10]Because that will... Oh, fuck you.
[164:21.80]Don't die.
[164:24.90]I have a heal.
[164:25.68]Heal.
[164:27.31]Use the salve.
[164:36.33]I need to give that to somebody.
[164:37.41]Probably you.
[164:43.91]I... What?
[164:45.23]Better remove... Isn't that remove blind?
[164:49.63]Am I crazy?
[164:55.32]It's only on self.
[164:56.18]Yeah, but didn't he... Ogden's still on him.
[165:07.45]Public domain, Ribs Knight.
[165:10.59]This is going to do two damage, so... Let's just kill this.
[165:20.32]Okay, well, at least he'll die.
[165:26.04]Oh, another good relationship.
[165:27.94]Hopeful.
[165:28.96]If there's a group that's gonna make it, it's this one.
[165:33.62]This is to make sure they don't die.
[165:43.55]Okay, this person's gotta go.
[165:48.34]All ribs are public domain.
[165:55.29]Ooh, nice.
[165:55.73]Okay.
[165:57.87]So, I think I'm just going to swing.
[165:59.69]Because that's going to... I'm going to do more damage, right?
[166:05.10]So, it ignores this.
[166:07.56]Good.
[166:08.16]Should I heal or throw their grenade?
[166:16.76]No.
[166:24.07]Ah.
[166:27.90]And you pretend to be a fat bastard singing, I want my baby back ribs.
[166:37.66]From Austin Powers?
[166:41.89]Um, I should probably take that off.
[166:49.71]Too far away for this, so I'm just going to heal.
[166:52.48]Or stress reduce.
[166:54.08]There is comfort in company.
[167:02.61]It's the back guys aren't even a problem.
[167:03.93]These guys are the big problem.
[167:05.07]They do so much damage.
[167:05.85]These guys gotta go.
[167:08.23]Come on.
[167:24.56]Well, I gotta heal.
[167:31.07]to do a Shrek impression?
[167:32.09]I feel like if I do a Shrek impression, you're just going to mistake it for a Gordon Ramsay impression.
[167:41.59]No.
[167:42.23]Stop it.
[167:43.34]No.
[167:43.48]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[167:45.46]Stop.
[167:46.00]No.
[167:46.90]Come on.
[167:47.46]Come on.
[167:48.90]What are you doing?
[167:49.68]No.
[167:49.78]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[167:55.94]If you go to his TikTok...
[167:58.94]He just, like, watches people make food and just goes, oh, stop it.
[168:02.32]Stop it.
[168:03.44]No, what you doing?
[168:04.84]What you doing?
[168:07.12]What you doing to my Wellington?
[168:12.11]They're like cameos.
[168:13.27]Alright, kill this.
[168:20.21]No!
[168:20.77]No!
[168:28.72]You all have never watched Shrek?
[168:30.02]Who has not watch- these people are gonna die because I can't hit anything.
[168:33.90]This person has so many buffs.
[168:58.25]You just said this was the run?
[168:59.28]It very well could be.
[169:01.44]Death's door.
[169:01.86]Now, what are you doing?
[169:13.15]It's usually somebody making, like, a Skittles ham turkey and chocolate Wellington.
[169:18.97]And he's just like, oh, what?
[169:19.85]What are you doing?
[169:21.51]Stop it!
[169:28.30]There's no time limit just as long as I can heal the stress is fine doesn't matter how long the fight goes What the fuck I don't think I've hit a melee attack in like five turns Come on
[169:55.36]50% of 50% is 50%.
[169:56.42]It's a coin flip.
[169:57.86]I haven't gotten one heads.
[170:09.35]Alright, we're just going for a fucking headshot here.
[170:13.35]I probably should have taken off the debuff.
[170:21.60]Or the buff, whatever.
[170:26.09]You're gonna dodge this, aren't you?
[170:28.05]75% chance to dodge.
[170:29.05]Fuck.
[170:29.27]Alright, I gotta remember this.
[170:30.09]These guys just dodge each other.
[170:32.46]And he has to take it off.
[170:33.74]Uh, I'm gonna... I'm just gonna try to hit you with this.
[170:40.39]See if it hits.
[170:41.21]A miscalculation, perhaps.
[170:50.90]Um, okay, you can hit.
[170:53.14]But this is, you can't.
[170:54.28]Alright, I can't throw the grenade over here.
[170:57.04]Just do this.
[170:57.56]I need to remove this.
[171:04.73]Like, seriously, how long does it remove?
[171:08.23]Oh my god, give me a break.
[171:13.59]I...
[171:19.62]It removes... Okay.
[171:22.14]You don't have it, but... I have to shoot the gun in the back.
[171:27.64]Finally.
[171:28.38]Thank God.
[171:34.06]Wait, what?
[171:34.66]Oh.
[171:34.82]Whoa, you put a dot on that.
[171:39.72]That's cool.
[171:46.13]I can kill you.
[171:48.85]Please.
[171:52.19]Alright, now take this shit off.
[171:53.50]Wanna play chess?
[171:56.84]I can't do chess, I'm sorry.
[172:02.71]Who has the remove dodge?
[172:03.69]Somebody does.
[172:04.15]Who has the remove dodge?
[172:23.49]God damn it.
[172:29.14]Yeah.
[172:31.58]Heal your tank.
[172:36.70]Remove... I don't have... I guess I'm just going to defend.
[172:39.53]Or I'm just going to try to... I'm just going to miss, what, 70%?
[172:41.53]50%?
[172:41.59]50% dodge seems like... That seems insanely high.
[172:56.82]This, okay, ignores that, but he doesn't even have it anymore.
[173:04.93]Heal him.
[173:05.59]I got a salve.
[173:06.23]I'm good.
[173:07.53]I had like two or three other people.
[173:09.15]I know.
[173:09.47]I got a salve.
[173:11.09]I knew he had a salve.
[173:17.46]Slash him.
[173:17.84]Slash him.
[173:28.83]I'll die from the poison.
[173:36.09]The death's door on enemies thing... I can't say I like.
[173:40.11]What the fuck?
[173:40.98]Just... Die!
[173:59.47]Oh shit.
[173:59.71]If Dark Impulse is equipped, you get plus 40% HP.
[174:06.24]Unlocks the potential of Cultist Trinkets?
[174:10.36]What is that?
[174:29.11]Oh shit, alright.
[174:33.35]That's good?
[174:33.85]Damn, alright.
[174:37.28]Okay, okay, hold on.
[174:39.82]Should I put that on him then?
[174:42.82]Is this a negative though?
[174:44.26]69 HP.
[174:58.28]Okay, that seems like a really good item.
[174:59.54]I really don't want to mess this up.
[175:04.30]Healing salves, good.
[175:06.86]Need something new.
[175:09.34]Yeah, put the horror on you.
[175:12.18]And then clear corpses on you.
[175:15.90]That's the second best cultist.
[175:18.48]Drink it.
[175:18.82]Really?
[175:20.50]Holy shit.
[175:20.90]Alright, let's go.
[175:22.16]This is a cultist encounter.
[175:23.60]Alright, I have to be careful.
[175:24.63]I really want to try to do well here.
[175:28.63]Is there anything else I can do for now?
[175:30.23]No, I gotta be careful.
[175:42.11]Heal?
[175:42.45]I think they automatically heal, right?
[175:57.92]No?
[175:58.72]Heal.
[175:59.52]Heal, heal.
[176:00.04]Yeah, you can't heal on the road.
[176:05.84]Shit.
[176:06.20]Okay, another one of these.
[176:07.12]Oh, now that I know what these guys do, it's all about, like, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[176:26.83]Hmm.
[176:37.62]No, I got a fight coming up right here.
[176:39.22]I feel like that's not a good idea.
[176:43.24]Academic study or watchtower?
[176:49.06]Academic study?
[176:54.85]The academic study is a foray into the abandoned towers of these cosmic-obsessed learners.
[177:00.19]The word items you'll find within can yield great rewards, but not without commensurate dangers.
[177:07.97]And then a watchtower.
[177:10.61]Watchtower scouts every future location in this region.
[177:13.91]It's usually well worth the detour, especially early in a region.
[177:18.81]I think I want to do that one.
[177:22.29]They all want to do the watchtower, so that's where we're going.
[177:23.95]Okay, here we go.
[177:40.40]new enemies that I need to learn about five rounds who are the pit fighter they look like they're on fire person in the back is very fast I think they have to die first they have really low blight resistance so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna go ahead and do that come on
[178:10.31]And the middle.
[178:14.71]Let's just try to get this guy down if we can.
[178:16.49]What the fa- Huh?
[178:20.57]They have 20 resistance.
[178:22.23]Like 20%?
[178:22.41]What the fuck?
[178:26.57]Oh my god.
[178:32.31]Okay.
[178:36.51]Well.
[178:38.29]Uh.
[178:48.96]You're not gonna make it.
[178:50.36]Well, you don't know that.
[178:53.38]Oh, I need the thing that, uh... Let's take that off.
[179:07.12]Can you please designate a corner of the screen for bird watching videos?
[179:10.00]That was actually really funny.
[179:14.02]Uh...
[179:20.58]Okay.
[179:22.09]Poison!
[179:22.57]Thank you.
[179:27.89]I don't burn watching videos.
[179:31.74]No!
[179:49.77]Should I heal or should I just take?
[179:51.57]I feel like I don't have many opportunities to do anything.
[180:01.24]I guess I'm just going to try to kill the person in the back.
[180:08.82]What is this?
[180:11.98]Next turn will be delayed to the end of the round.
[180:19.84]I wish I could make a team.
[180:20.90]Okay.
[180:21.06]I guess I'm going to have to just
[180:47.98]Just put defense on?
[180:48.90]Yeah, I think I'm just going to put defense on.
[180:50.52]I think I can't.
[180:56.01]It's a 50% chance to miss that guy.
[181:02.51]Or just make it five rounds.
[181:03.49]Please confirm or deny that you use TikTok in some capacity.
[181:11.87]I don't use TikTok.
[181:13.71]I've seen TikTok videos.
[181:22.57]Is that enough?
[181:27.89]Fuck!
[181:28.57]I thought it was gonna be enough.
[181:31.16]50% doesn't go away till you hit him.
[181:42.18]We want birds.
[181:43.36]I can't just play bird videos.
[181:49.07]I guess I'm gonna just take a swing.
[181:58.31]You'll die from the poisons.
[181:59.30]Just, I don't know, heal somebody.
[182:04.26]Just in the corner.
[182:07.06]Is it like there's a bird watching video you guys want me to put on?
[182:17.52]Die from the poison.
[182:19.42]You have that on.
[182:20.35]I need to just queue up an anti-defense or something.
[182:25.57]Let's go for this.
[182:30.61]Use advance?
[182:31.69]Jesus.
[182:34.21]Jesus.
[182:46.34]I feel like I just wandered into an area that's way higher than I'm supposed to be.
[182:54.55]Cracking shot.
[182:58.63]What is that thing?
[183:00.21]Oh, it's the repose.
[183:00.85]Okay.
[183:02.06]Uh... We'll do it on you.
[183:05.90]This is going to do more damage.
[183:06.80]Here we go.
[183:16.99]Yeah, I knew I was going to have another shot.
[183:20.29]I don't want to use the salve unless I need to.
[183:21.56]I only have like two or three more.
[183:22.48]Is this person going to die from a turn already?
[183:33.02]God, I'm going to have to use it now.
[183:40.33]Thank you.
[183:45.51]Should I even use the... Oh my god.
[183:47.71]I don't think... I only have one more round to go.
[183:51.00]Should I even use the salve?
[183:55.64]I'm in trouble here.
[183:56.24]I won't die.
[184:21.14]Alright, hold on.
[184:23.94]You want birds on screen?
[184:37.80]Ultimate bird video for cats to watch.
[184:40.26]Just in case your cat is watching.
[184:50.27]Okay.
[185:25.56]Why can I not move?
[185:34.89]Okay.
[185:35.05]Are you happy?
[185:55.82]Just to survive.
[186:12.37]Put your face next to the bird and act like you're going to eat it.
[186:24.58]Uh... I don't... I just have to... survive, I guess?
[186:30.36]It's done after this if somebody... if you stay alive?
[186:32.42]Um, well this is it.
[186:46.54]The fucking bird video is distracting me.
[186:48.72]I keep looking at it.
[186:51.16]I keep looking over here at these birds.
[187:23.08]It's like you're eating the seeds with the birds.
[187:31.93]This feels like I have so much... Okay, let me ask a question.
[187:35.31]Be honest.
[187:39.35]I feel like I have so much further to go.
[187:42.17]I'm just not going to be able to get there.
[187:46.34]Are you, like, supposed to not be able to do this for, like, the first, like, five to ten runs?
[187:51.30]I feel like you're probably not, right?
[187:55.30]That's the whole point of the game is to not... Yeah.
[187:56.98]Yeah.
[187:59.07]Because in the first one, it was, like, broken up into different sections that were short dungeons.
[188:05.14]So this is, like, the whole thing.
[188:08.16]And you're realistically only supposed to get, like, here.
[188:12.24]Or, like, here.
[188:12.84]Or maybe you get, like, really lucky and go all the way.
[188:14.48]It's a simple choice.
[188:23.05]At least it should be.
[188:26.04]Hero shrine or insistence encounter?
[188:29.28]Hero shrine.
[188:43.45]Where are the birds?
[188:44.11]There they are.
[188:45.79]This is only two guys.
[188:46.99]This should be easy.
[189:00.19]Alright, let's... You already have a plus attack, so might as well just use it.
[189:04.94]And this is... Let's just crit the hell out of this guy.
[189:14.98]Humble.
[189:15.56]Let's try to kill him.
[189:26.37]Hey, get out of there.
[189:27.89]That's not yours.
[189:29.19]That's not for you.
[189:30.57]Stop eating the bird's bird seed.
[189:31.93]I'm more interested.
[189:38.02]Wait, I'm... He's like, hey, get out of here.
[189:43.58]This is our bird seed.
[189:46.26]Can I have some?
[189:48.86]Thank you.
[189:56.45]I'll take some more, please.
[189:57.27]What are these, seeds?
[190:02.99]Yes, I love seeds.
[190:06.60]Mmm, delicious.
[190:14.86]Let him have some.
[190:18.00]How much can they eat?
[190:18.84]Where does it all go?
[190:21.16]And what?
[190:21.70]The birds are so weird, man.
[190:25.17]Birds are in x10 speed.
[190:29.43]Look at that, the beak moving up and down.
[190:31.09]I feel like this video is moving three or four times speed.
[190:34.05]That, like, crunch.
[190:37.46]The fact that they've ripped their bodies around.
[190:46.86]Slow it down.
[190:47.58]You're proving that people think that the birds are more interesting than this game.
[190:53.33]That's not true.
[190:56.34]He's getting closer.
[190:58.52]He's going to get close.
[190:59.74]Look at this.
[191:00.24]Look at how close the one in the middle is getting to the camera.
[191:11.11]Birds are government drones, though.
[191:15.55]And why did they make them shit?
[191:23.28]Think about that.
[191:27.88]It's a, that's data dump.
[191:32.39]Because it's funny.
[191:38.25]Okay, I'm moving this.
[191:39.05]This is, what a great video.
[191:40.15]Alright, what was it?
[191:45.39]Okay, I gotta kill these people.
[191:47.91]Six damage.
[191:48.73]I'm gonna just load up on... I gotta do this.
[191:51.65]Press heal.
[191:53.88]Okay.
[192:09.90]Hey, let's get rid of you.
[192:18.88]Make the game small instead of the birds.
[192:20.54]No.
[192:21.12]No.
[192:31.67]Remember your primate brain is sparking at the sight of birds.
[192:36.65]What are you talking about?
[192:42.20]Your cousin from Boston.
[192:47.32]45 leagues to the end.
[192:48.54]What's going on?
[192:49.04]Are people talking?
[192:52.66]I thought they were talking in the carriage.
[193:03.83]I was like, do they have voice acting here?
[193:09.63]Squirrel's back.
[193:13.15]Hey, get out of there.
[193:14.09]No, I like these seeds.
[193:17.37]You're not supposed to be over there.
[193:19.05]I know.
[193:19.43]I'm having so much fun.
[193:20.15]You're not supposed to be having fun over there.
[193:22.57]Get out of there.
[193:23.89]That one is scrumptious.
[193:24.51]That one is juicy.
[193:25.63]What's over here?
[193:33.39]There's a leaf.
[193:35.09]What's this one?
[193:37.19]Mmm.
[193:38.83]That one tastes like, um, tomato.
[193:41.96]This one tastes like dirt.
[193:44.34]Mmm.
[193:47.42]What kind of smell is it?
[193:53.56]It's more than what... Look at how cute his face is.
[193:59.50]I gotta do the funny thing from Otto's Big Adventure.
[194:04.54]Okay.
[194:15.30]You're distracting me.
[194:16.02]Stop it.
[194:23.22]This is much better.
[194:24.04]I'm sorry.
[194:24.54]No.
[194:26.10]Stop saying that or I'll fucking never stream ever again.
[194:28.62]I'll quit tomorrow.
[194:29.64]Let's go here.
[194:37.66]we must understand the past if we are ever to be free of it you enjoy the birds I do I birds are so fun they're just so cool alright echoes of the past I was the smartest but wisdom was not on the syllabus yeah I want like doctor we have to turn this off for a minute chapter two head of the class
[195:12.86]Look, the plaguebearer has a bird beak.
[195:16.04]What is this?
[195:16.48]Disprove the professor.
[195:17.60]Are we doing ace attorney?
[195:19.55]Review notes.
[195:20.29]Hated rebuttal.
[195:20.73]Sit down.
[195:44.80]Disprove the professor.
[195:48.38]This is a mobile game ad.
[195:56.72]What the fuck?
[195:59.85]Should I minus three?
[196:03.85]Sit down.
[196:10.93]Students.
[196:13.12]What the fuck?
[196:19.12]Review notes?
[196:20.94]I... I don't think I... I think I lost.
[196:33.07]How many times do I need to review the notes before I can rebuttal?
[196:50.19]I don't understand.
[196:50.79]I don't get what's going on.
[196:54.29]Rebuttal after the conclusion.
[196:58.72]Um... Okay.
[197:03.64]So, conclusion, conclusion.
[197:06.80]Your digestive system needs to be looked at.
[197:09.20]Okay, rebuttal.
[197:09.82]Did that work?
[197:15.48]Symptoms of terminal illness.
[197:17.26]What the fuck?
[197:18.02]I just...
[197:25.27]Did I hardlock myself out of winning?
[197:27.75]Alright.
[197:44.12]There we go.
[197:45.42]Then this should kill him.
[197:58.08]You poisoned him with your knowledge.
[198:00.14]That's the move I've been waiting for since I started the video game.
[198:08.15]That's the one I wanted the whole time.
[198:16.64]Death by fact and logic.
[198:26.71]You're almost out of the tutorial.
[198:27.97]I'm out of the tutorial.
[198:29.43]The whole game is the whole tutorial.
[198:31.19]What do you mean?
[198:33.67]I want to activate that because that's the move I like.
[198:35.19]Because that's the one that throws the grenade into the back row.
[198:40.82]What have I not used that I don't really care about?
[198:42.62]Probably this.
[198:43.14]Like, who cares about that?
[198:43.98]This is for the front row.
[198:48.10]This is to blind people in the back.
[198:49.60]And this is to... Yeah.
[198:51.79]I like that.
[198:52.21]That's good.
[198:54.17]That's good.
[199:04.48]Hoarder or Academic Study.
[199:08.72]What is Academic Study?
[199:20.23]Where is it?
[199:22.01]Did I go by it?
[199:25.64]Okay, the foray into the abandoned towers.
[199:27.48]I think I want to do the Hoarder.
[199:37.69]Yeah.
[199:50.00]Okay, shit.
[199:50.80]I don't know what these guys do.
[199:57.36]Alright, I got my grenade.
[200:01.32]These guys have bad blight resistance.
[200:03.24]This is how I turn it around.
[200:07.93]And you dodged it.
[200:09.31]Okay.
[200:12.44]Watch restoration videos next.
[200:16.20]You guys really want... I mean, honestly, we'll see how... A public domain movie night.
[200:20.34]People are looking forward to it.
[200:22.26]What?
[200:22.48]I was like, what happened?
[200:25.23]What?
[200:39.73]I'm just like who's I keep thinking that somebody in the game Okay um let's get back to reality here, and I'm gonna double up poison on you Go word video Okay, so you've got five
[201:08.75]Poison.
[201:09.23]This will kill you eventually.
[201:11.11]I don't care about you anymore.
[201:13.81]Now we gotta worry about this bastard.
[201:16.93]And I'm sorry I'm using that language.
[201:18.60]Hey.
[201:34.55]Um...
[201:38.51]I think I want to use... No, let's just queue it up.
[201:42.60]When are you going to do a birdwatching stream?
[201:47.80]I really wanted to just do a turn it on, just be out in the wilderness somewhere with binoculars.
[201:52.92]The problem is, how do you see that?
[201:56.94]I would need to have a huge telephoto lens.
[202:01.20]Connected to like an IRL backpack.
[202:08.97]Okay, what does that do?
[202:10.07]Okay.
[202:10.31]I'm gonna go right here.
[202:22.78]But then I think about... I mean, I... Cameras?
[202:27.10]I would probably need to hire somebody that was really know how to use a telephoto lens.
[202:31.37]An actual, like... Animal photographer.
[202:36.10]And I would just walk around and just make comments?
[202:38.90]Just eat, like, sandwiches?
[202:40.54]Just eat, like, bologna and cheese sandwiches while they zoomed in on birds?
[202:43.80]Okay, you'll die from the poison.
[202:47.92]It's time for you.
[202:48.86]You have that.
[202:49.58]I don't like that at all.
[202:51.72]But... Mmm...
[203:06.59]You have that bullshit.
[203:20.52]That's what a BBC Earth documentary is.
[203:24.28]When it eats a sandwich while the other people zoom in on birds.
[203:44.75]Nine... Fuck.
[203:56.80]The fire... The fire rises!
[204:06.54]Oh yes.
[204:07.79]I'm going to try to get -2 for like five straight minutes.
[204:39.88]Oh, you think doctors is your ally?
[204:43.96]But I lived in the darkness.
[204:45.98]I grew up in the darkness.
[204:48.16]And you are blind.
[204:49.54]And that's when Batman does a little tumble down in his grave.
[205:01.87]Sell it.
[205:02.39]Sell everything.
[205:03.39]Sell everything.
[205:04.37]Sell it.
[205:09.43]Check this out.
[205:10.36]Boom.
[205:17.68]Do the whole plane sequence, so to put on subtitles.
[205:20.78]And just sit there and word for word say exactly at the exact same time every word that Bane says.
[205:31.15]I can't.
[205:32.07]I can't play like a movie on stream.
[205:33.94]You know what I'm saying?
[205:34.54]Like it's...
[205:40.51]Oh my god, I'm turning the bird video off.
[205:46.81]I'm turning off the... Put it at 50% opacity over the birds.
[206:03.77]That was a great video.
[206:07.59]Alright, you're dead from the poison.
[206:08.94]I need to... I don't know.
[206:13.94]What the fuck can I even do here?
[206:15.24]Alright, just... swing at the guy.
[206:21.49]There's defenses.
[206:26.19]50-50 chance.
[206:27.11]I haven't gotten it once.
[206:34.91]This is... I can't even hit... This person's not gonna get hurt.
[206:37.45]Okay.
[206:50.64]Emily, please...
[207:01.86]Kind of like how Twitch couldn't play a Pokémon movie during the Pokémon marathon.
[207:06.64]Really?
[207:07.80]Death door, get out of here.
[207:10.56]Come on.
[207:11.58]Are you serious?
[207:12.90]And there's nothing even on him anymore.
[207:15.26]Oh, that sucks.
[207:24.31]That sucks.
[207:25.11]I have to... Come on!
[207:28.85]The...
[207:39.36]fucking die already.
[207:45.72]Put on monkey videos.
[207:48.57]Where am I even going to find that?
[207:49.53]I don't like this like 50, 100% dodge shit.
[208:02.90]I don't like it.
[208:03.40]I don't like it.
[208:05.22]I don't like it.
[208:06.36]I don't like it.
[208:12.33]Where are the monkeys?
[208:13.53]Alright, let me see if I can find one.
[208:23.31]What would I even, like, monkey... Like... What would I even... How do you title... What would I title this?
[208:30.63]Because if I type in monkey video, I get, like, funny monkey videos.
[208:37.28]Like, zoo?
[208:38.30]I don't know.
[208:48.57]No, I'm... We're done.
[208:50.25]I'm not doing this shit right now.
[208:52.85]I'm not doing this.
[208:55.45]I'm not doing this right now.
[208:57.49]I need to hit... I can't hit anybody.
[209:00.41]I'm going to defend... I'm just going to bolster my defenses.
[209:06.88]I'm going to... I'm going to bolster my defenses.
[209:11.66]I request it.
[209:15.95]Fuck!
[209:17.07]Ow!
[209:17.61]What about electrical shock?
[209:26.33]My toenails hurt now.
[209:29.27]My toenails are sore from that.
[209:40.10]No, oh, the distraction didn't work.
[209:42.93]When he said no amount of funny voices in quotes, it's gonna make us forget about you didn't put a monkey video on.
[209:49.76]And you put it in quotes too.
[210:09.35]Words are better, I'm leaving.
[210:10.49]Put on baby sensory videos.
[210:28.48]You know, everybody?
[210:29.42]Okay.
[210:30.82]I have a better idea.
[210:32.93]Let me do you one up.
[210:34.87]How about an entire stream where we watch baby sensory content and see how it affects me?
[210:43.87]See what it does to me.
[210:56.72]I feel like that would be a fun, like, you laugh, you lose challenge with baby sensory videos.
[211:02.57]We'd have to do, like, a bunch of different categories, right?
[211:04.63]Okay, there he is.
[211:17.41]Yeah, haha, and it would be funny if you wore a diaper, haha.
[211:29.09]Okay, I need more.
[211:33.43]Can I do the upgrade of the coach wagon thing?
[211:40.14]I need just heals.
[211:45.13]Are there any heals?
[211:50.90]Okay, so, I got a question.
[211:53.76]This is, if the target is burning, it cures the burn and heals 10% HP.
[211:59.77]But if the target's not burning, does it heal 10% HP?
[212:04.37]They have to be burning for the second thing to happen.
[212:09.36]Has to be, right?
[212:14.18]Okay, cool.
[212:17.23]These are all in-items, combat items.
[212:19.25]I want one of these.
[212:20.62]This was really useful last time.
[212:24.62]In-item.
[212:25.26]Wait, hold on.
[212:26.60]I don't have any baubles.
[212:28.94]I thought you kept the baubles between runs, no?
[212:35.45]I feel like these people were people that were burning.
[212:36.95]Alright, that's enough.
[212:47.30]That's enough.
[212:50.74]Get a pacifier, too.
[212:52.04]Alright, you need to time people up that are doing that.
[212:55.84]Immediately.
[212:56.46]Alright, so if people want to go to the academic study... Is this the lair?
[213:11.41]Alright, so this is the lair.
[213:14.71]There's no way I'm going to go this far.
[213:20.75]High risk, high reward.
[213:22.39]Mysterious.
[213:24.24]We'll check it out.
[213:25.08]We'll go this way.
[213:31.97]Yeah, I need to de-stress anyways.
[213:48.93]You joined my Minecraft world.
[213:50.11]I tested everything, but I'm not sure if I port forwarded right.
[213:52.37]Can you just join real quick?
[213:59.68]No.
[214:00.50]I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
[214:01.40]I don't know what you're doing.
[214:02.82]It's a cannon.
[214:13.36]I mean, you may as well have just said, hey, can I have your IP?
[214:16.82]Like, you may as well have just said the same thing, right?
[214:26.59]I mean, the answer is no for both of those things.
[214:29.85]So this takes 75% less damage, but you bleed and stuff goes through that.
[214:37.69]A blight goes through it, right?
[214:38.79]No, nothing does.
[214:41.15]um you kind of just have to die kill this guy you have a vpn though alright just forget it someone try to kill this guy as soon as possible is anyone is anyone controlling this unit
[215:20.58]Loading the shot.
[215:22.56]Okay, so when he dies, maybe this thing can't be used?
[215:26.02]Not bad.
[215:29.38]Alright.
[215:37.23]Debuff?
[215:37.87]Oh.
[215:39.79]I can't hurt this guy.
[215:50.91]Can I?
[215:53.61]One?
[215:58.64]Oh, it was just for that one hit.
[216:01.08]Okay.
[216:04.56]Oh, shit.
[216:05.20]This is not good.
[216:12.50]Type in monkey compilation.
[216:13.96]No, I'm not doing a monkey compilation.
[216:18.76]Misfire.
[216:19.32]Ooh, that's good.
[216:21.34]Everyone's happy about that.
[216:25.92]Kill it quick.
[216:26.62]Kill.
[216:35.10]I'm going to load the cannon and I'm going to have another opportunity here.
[216:43.38]I'm not doing a monkey compilation!
[216:46.81]Why is the audio so weird?
[216:47.67]Why is he throwing poison grenades at an enemy?
[217:17.35]I...
[217:21.06]I'm not going to do the thing that everybody wants me to do.
[217:24.36]And if you want to know what that thing is, it's the chat.
[217:27.32]I'm not going to do that.
[217:28.42]I'm not going to do the monkey video chat.
[217:30.06]I am not going to open up a monkey video.
[217:31.90]And then I open up a monkey video in like 10 minutes.
[217:34.18]I can't give you the satisfaction of like the joke that is my mannerisms and how I act.
[217:41.80]I'm not going to do it.
[217:43.72]I am not going to.
[217:44.74]I am not going to.
[217:45.64]I'm not.
[217:46.04]It's not going to happen.
[217:46.76]I'm not going to play a monkey video.
[217:48.30]And this time for real, actually for real this time.
[217:56.52]No, he's becoming self-aware?
[217:57.98]Yeah, because I see that copypasta everywhere.
[218:03.23]And then I think about it, I go, fuck, I actually do that, don't I?
[218:06.51]No, I don't.
[218:13.60]Okay, this is the unknown.
[218:14.94]This is beyond me, let us continue.
[218:22.60]Mixed Quirk, Combat, Stress Damage, Flame.
[218:25.90]I don't think I should do this.
[218:26.88]I don't think so.
[218:35.67]No, goodbye.
[218:45.57]Hospital.
[218:47.09]Hospital.
[218:48.79]Wait, everyone's fine.
[218:51.29]Part 3 of Plague Doctor.
[219:06.10]What about a sensory monkey video?
[219:07.90]What, a sensory baby monkey video?
[219:14.30]Yeah, I'm going to watch baby sensory videos.
[219:15.96]I'm going to have a notepad.
[219:17.00]I'm going to write down my exact feelings at the moment that I feel them.
[219:23.02]I will have a notepad on stream.
[219:25.42]And I'm going to just type.
[219:27.24]Like exactly how I feel.
[219:28.20]Alright, we're going to do another.
[219:36.65]I mean, I feel like we're doing this story.
[219:44.43]Extra credit.
[219:46.76]Extra credit.
[219:53.71]This video made me feel very goo goo ga ga.
[219:55.97]Isn't that me?
[219:56.65]Her long awaited opportunity.
[219:58.77]And she would not waste it.
[220:23.09]This is not John Goodman.
[220:35.92]It's not John Goodman.
[220:38.08]Somebody asked if it was John Goodman.
[220:43.89]Hey, Party Boy, thanks for the 20 subs.
[220:48.49]Requires target less than 50% HP.
[220:52.53]10% healed per positive token.
[220:56.69]Heal 10%, remove all positive tokens.
[221:00.47]So for every buff that the person has, you take them all away, but you heal 10% per thing, and you get a mastery.
[221:07.77]Okay.
[221:11.60]Wait, I just, I didn't have to do anything?
[221:17.20]Sorry I called you a goblin earlier, my bad.
[221:19.10]It's alright.
[221:21.04]Alright.
[221:30.86]Hold on, there's new stuff.
[221:35.40]Sure.
[221:38.14]Uh, everybody have a combat item?
[221:41.90]We do.
[221:46.00]I'm almost at the inn.
[221:48.23]Let me just get to that.
[221:49.21]I've been once in this whole stream.
[221:51.45]It's been four hours.
[221:52.33]I hate monkeys, and it would be so sad if they were shown on stream.
[222:12.02]My day would be ruined.
[222:16.47]she heals the injuries of others field hospital while ignoring her own um does this work field hospital is the only place where you may cure diseases remove negative quirks or reinforce positive quirks what the why can I not say that positive course yeah that was weird
[222:51.66]Anybody have anything?
[222:58.62]Um... Wellness?
[223:01.30]Pharmacy.
[223:01.64]Okay, wellness.
[223:06.73]Horn rotator cuff.
[223:09.69]And get rid of that.
[223:10.35]Minus 5% max HP.
[223:19.65]Knowledge supreme overall.
[223:20.79]I don't know what that means.
[223:22.42]Not motivated to do all that much.
[223:24.74]Probably this one.
[223:25.10]What else do you have?
[223:26.92]Do you have heals?
[223:32.63]Don't have just regular heals.
[223:35.31]Oh well.
[223:35.47]What are you doing with this blue dot thing?
[223:43.84]How do you peel a banana?
[223:45.46]You take the long kind of stick stem part, turn it upside down, pinch the bottom so the two edges of the bottom go split, and then you pull it out that way.
[223:53.93]Hey, thank you, Grubinski.
[223:58.35]Thanks for the 15 community subs, Grubinski.
[224:05.38]15 subs, thank you.
[224:08.02]I don't think I want to buy anything.
[224:09.40]I'm going to get rid of this.
[224:12.96]Which way is upside down on a banana?
[224:31.23]I don't know if there is.
[224:31.95]Is there an upside down or right side up?
[224:38.79]I'm getting close.
[224:47.20]Livian's Rampart.
[224:55.50]This is new.
[224:55.94]What is this guy?
[225:00.02]Block two hits.
[225:01.13]Takes 75.
[225:01.71]Okay.
[225:02.69]Ignores defense.
[225:07.65]What do you got for resistance?
[225:14.71]Oh.
[225:16.49]Thank you.
[225:16.73]Yep.
[225:18.70]Flame spreads.
[225:19.78]They're getting... I think they're moving closer and closer every turn.
[225:24.48]That person has died now.
[225:37.88]Good.
[225:38.28]That's going to be five.
[225:40.40]Yeah, you'll die before you get there.
[225:42.26]Good.
[225:42.50]Let's go ahead and do... Go right in the middle here.
[225:51.55]He moves forward.
[225:52.17]I might just kill him.
[225:53.21]We'll see.
[225:54.83]Steady yourself.
[226:04.84]How many skeletons could you kill before they got?
[226:07.36]I thought it said guts.
[226:08.58]It said something else.
[226:10.94]I thought you said until they get to your guts.
[226:12.54]And I was like, okay, well, I'll answer that.
[226:13.92]But you said a different word and I'm not going to respond.
[226:20.53]This is five.
[226:21.67]It returns one, two.
[226:22.83]Yeah, stack it.
[226:27.07]Seven.
[226:28.25]Yeah, this person will be dead.
[226:30.58]Keep moving forward.
[226:31.04]I don't care.
[226:36.90]Stack it on this guy, too.
[226:38.34]Resist, damn it.
[226:39.04]Ignite!
[226:52.15]Oh, shit.
[226:52.87]That's not good.
[226:55.83]Seven, two turns.
[226:57.17]Three.
[226:57.79]Uh... I gotta get that off of you.
[227:04.47]How many skeletons until they're able to...
[227:08.02]How many skeletons would take before they... How many skeletons could I fight and win?
[227:11.96]I'll answer that question, because that's... Because they're asking all kinds of fucking weird shit.
[227:16.72]Listen.
[227:18.16]I would be able to take... I would say... Does the skeleton have a weapon?
[227:24.51]If it's like the character from Killer Instinct.
[227:27.47]I don't... That character's trained.
[227:29.65]If it was just a skeleton walking towards me, like lumbering towards me, I would just have a baseball bat, and I would just break all their bones.
[227:35.95]I would just swing and smash their bones in half.
[227:38.48]Probably quite a few.
[227:39.22]At least five.
[227:40.00]I think I'd be able to take.
[227:47.32]A full bat swing on a skeleton.
[227:49.36]It's just going to have a forearm.
[227:51.21]Bone.
[227:52.33]It would break in half.
[227:53.25]There'd be nothing to stop it.
[227:59.67]If you want to talk of weapons, I would go blunt weapon versus sharp weapon any day of the week.
[228:05.30]Because Sharp Weapon doesn't work on stuff that's not, like, flesh and blood.
[228:09.56]You know?
[228:11.20]Blunt will work on everything.
[228:14.44]I would have, like, one of those Battle Hammers.
[228:19.83]It works on everything.
[228:24.55]You're dead in one turn anyways, so let's go ahead and stack the poison on you.
[228:28.57]Really?
[228:30.87]Really?
[228:34.06]Does silver do extra damage to skeletons?
[228:35.78]I don't think so.
[228:36.24]That's a werewolf.
[228:39.72]Blunt will work on anything.
[228:42.26]If you're getting surrounded by skeletons and you have a sword and you can't cut a skeleton's bone, I mean, you'll be able to hit it and it'll be like, ding!
[228:50.05]But if it was a big, heavy, blunt battle hammer, it would just shatter the bones.
[229:04.84]You're using RPG logic.
[229:07.01]Well, if you want to use real logic, the spear is probably the best weapon ever invented.
[229:13.73]It has range, it has sharpness, it has maneuverability.
[229:16.59]The spear is probably the best weapon across all of history.
[229:20.09]I'm just saying what I would personally like to use.
[229:26.99]Get rid of this stupid thing so we can hit them.
[229:34.19]This is three and three.
[229:39.11]You'll dodge that, so fuck that.
[229:41.27]What'd you do?
[229:42.17]What about the gun?
[229:52.44]Right, but here's... A gun is...
[229:57.72]The gun was our way of, like, cheating.
[229:59.90]You understand?
[230:03.52]Like, we just invented cheats in battles.
[230:14.63]Oh, fuck.
[230:15.07]I should've... I'm an idiot.
[230:17.89]Spear... Oh, wait, hold on.
[230:18.69]This is a good relationship.
[230:21.90]amorous.
[230:24.27]50-50, whatever.
[230:25.27]What about the bow and arrow?
[230:33.07]Um... Yeah, but the bow and arrow was... Okay, so you have to, like, put the bow... Well, they had to load muskets, too.
[230:50.54]But no, but I think bow and arrow is harder to use than a gun.
[230:54.14]Because those old blunderbusses just shot in, like, fucking random direction, like, in front of you.
[230:59.42]It wasn't just a big, like... Jeremy, you can't deny the bow.
[231:14.67]What does this loot proceed to the next battle?
[231:19.56]Guardian?
[231:19.78]Guardian?
[231:22.48]Next rewards.
[231:23.26]Um, what's this?
[231:24.42]Advance?
[231:29.93]Oh, this is the tower thingy.
[231:31.71]Right.
[231:36.55]The bow is the precursor to the gun.
[231:37.95]Yeah, but the bow is harder to use than a gun.
[231:43.32]Alright, what do you got?
[231:49.32]I have to poison you.
[232:00.33]Crossbow was the first sign of cheating.
[232:01.91]Yeah.
[232:05.11]That's true.
[232:05.63]That's true.
[232:06.27]Crossbow was the first sign.
[232:11.25]I need to load.
[232:11.89]Let's go to this.
[232:22.51]How did you resist that?
[232:27.88]And those old muskets and those old blunderbusses, I would be so afraid to use them.
[232:34.18]I would feel like I would shoot that thing and it would explode in my face and just kill me.
[232:38.52]Uh, this is... I gotta be careful here.
[232:47.67]This is not looking good.
[232:48.41]I need to do the stress heal.
[232:57.53]Why are you mad about that?
[232:58.97]Yeah, keep moving forward.
[233:07.54]That's fine.
[233:08.50]Alright, I need to... You need to die.
[233:16.76]Or... Team Spirit's going bad.
[233:22.39]Yeah, it is.
[233:24.77]What about the poison blow dart?
[233:33.29]Imagine the lung power that it took to... Yeah, that is not cheating.
[233:38.63]Shooting a blow dart like a quarter of a mile and hitting somebody in the neck?
[233:45.01]Yeah, that's probably one of the hardest things in the world to ever do.
[233:58.40]Oh shit, I'm an idiot.
[234:07.30]They weren't shooting for the neck.
[234:11.60]Yeah, but in everything, in every piece of media, when a blowgun is used, it's always like... And it's like... In the person's neck.
[234:19.07]And they're like... And then they drop to the ground.
[234:31.91]Everything Jerma learned about blowguns comes from Ace Ventura.
[234:36.04]Okay.
[234:43.74]I have to be very honest with you guys.
[234:45.02]Because I hope I can be.
[234:47.88]That's my only reference.
[234:48.95]Another one does not exist.
[234:57.89]For me.
[234:59.05]That's my only reference.
[235:03.17]Alright, let's poison, uh, sure, you.
[235:12.25]Now we can go.
[235:14.13]Mmm.
[235:15.35]Yep.
[235:16.67]Oh my god, you had, I keep not, I need to pay more attention to what's under their cards.
[235:32.11]He'll die.
[235:33.81]I'm retreating after this.
[235:45.28]Who has the burn heal?
[235:47.42]Somebody does.
[235:50.08]Not you.
[235:56.88]What about opinion on throwing a shoot?
[235:58.38]I don't...
[236:03.39]Because anything can be used as a weapon if you throw it hard enough.
[236:05.49]Die already.
[236:27.50]What about throwing a monkey YouTube video?
[237:01.56]What about choking someone to death with your VR cables?
[237:04.20]What scenario?
[237:06.72]Oh shit, an intruder's in the house!
[237:09.00]Oh my god, I gotta find a weapon!
[237:10.70]Let me unbox my VR headset, get the long cables out and use that to strangle the guy.
[237:16.89]What?
[237:17.17]You're just running, dragging the headset just on the ground?
[237:25.21]No, I'm picking up my PlayStation and I'm gonna smash the person's head.
[237:34.92]Easiest weapon.
[237:36.06]Easiest weapon.
[237:36.98]If somebody's just like, boom, in your house, I'm ready.
[237:40.04]Just run up to your TV, fucking grab the PS4, and smash them into the head with it.
[237:47.30]You understand how dense and heavy a PlayStation is?
[237:50.36]These things are fucking, like, they're like 9 to 10, they're like 8 pounds.
[237:58.87]What if it's just your mom coming in?
[238:13.92]Whatever.
[238:18.48]Mom comes in with a couple bags of groceries.
[238:20.79]And just sprinting out with a PS4.
[238:27.31]You would know, but you would know it was your mom when she walked in with the groceries.
[238:30.79]That doesn't make any sense.
[238:32.45]This person's still alive.
[238:39.96]This is about to be bad Had to do that Just died What if she's wearing her Halloween costume from her work party
[239:14.12]This is not going to happen.
[239:29.74]Ooh, another positive.
[239:39.58]What if she dressed as a monkey video?
[239:42.54]Yeah, that's true.
[239:47.28]Oh my God, just kill this guy.
[239:49.66]Why are you... Who has the... Death's door, death's door, death's door.
[240:04.73]Oh, we're on death's door.
[240:06.33]Oh no, we're on death's door now.
[240:13.60]Oh my fucking god, just kill this thing.
[240:29.55]Kill.
[240:29.65]It's taking forever.
[240:33.49]Kill it.
[240:38.17]Thank you.
[240:38.76]I am...
[240:50.97]That was pretty cool looking.
[240:53.31]Alright, get me to the inn.
[241:01.73]I'm pretty much there.
[241:02.68]I made it to the first inn of the game.
[241:04.18]Took me five hours.
[241:05.16]Nice job.
[241:11.80]Uh, new trinket?
[241:12.38]What does it show me here?
[241:15.16]Oh, relationships.
[241:16.80]I see.
[241:23.50]Uh, I want to kill that.
[241:24.54]That is really, really bad.
[241:25.86]I need to start using that a lot.
[241:32.27]Yeah, I never clear the corpses.
[241:33.55]Why even put it on?
[241:34.17]Alright, you get that one.
[241:42.59]I'd rather have... Yeah, that's fine.
[241:44.79]Alright, let's go.
[241:57.83]Did the grave robber story?
[242:05.04]I did it.
[242:05.64]I actually made it here.
[242:06.36]That's very surprising.
[242:11.26]I'm surprised I got all the way here.
[242:23.96]Sprawl is hard.
[242:27.50]Hmm.
[242:27.84]Cool.
[242:29.90]Into Quark?
[242:32.50]Everybody's pretty much friendly?
[242:37.05]What is this?
[242:37.89]Loathing Howls?
[242:39.35]25% Flame Drain?
[242:40.09]I'm gonna be Battle Advantage.
[242:43.35]I'm getting all this bullshit.
[242:48.55]Okay.
[242:49.69]So.
[242:51.25]Minus one... Two targets, minus one stress.
[242:54.13]High chance of improving affinity.
[242:55.51]Alright, so we need to put that on you.
[243:00.59]Like, two recipients.
[243:01.69]Okay, you two.
[243:03.85]Very nice.
[243:06.06]Uh, minus three stress.
[243:06.98]We're gonna use it on you.
[243:08.44]You idiot!
[243:09.80]I clicked and held it.
[243:11.46]Oh my god.
[243:12.32]I, like, clicked and I didn't... I was trying to...
[243:21.40]I wanted to put it on her.
[243:22.22]Must bleed resistance until next in.
[243:29.48]Probably you.
[243:33.95]Minus 10% disease resist?
[243:37.05]I like that.
[243:37.51]I'm going for it.
[243:47.28]Fuck it.
[244:00.65]Okay.
[244:06.59]Be going with full heals.
[244:13.20]Alright, let me do the stagecoach.
[244:18.34]Stacking for relics.
[244:19.30]That's good.
[244:20.38]Produces flapjacks.
[244:23.16]Which I'm not sure what that does.
[244:28.03]I got three points.
[244:29.35]Here's the question.
[244:37.17]Whoa, what is that?
[244:38.23]Oh.
[244:40.77]I want the dot.
[244:43.55]Play grenade.
[244:44.24]I want it.
[244:45.10]I'm upgrading this.
[244:51.08]And I'm doing it again.
[244:51.84]I can't.
[245:12.51]Shield guy needs an upgrade.
[245:15.41]Bolster target.
[245:18.40]This removes stress.
[245:21.31]Bolster's a stress heal.
[245:22.89]Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.
[245:43.33]Um, do more heals.
[245:48.96]I feel like I need to upgrade the heal.
[245:51.06]It's probably really important.
[246:01.59]Is this... Mr. Green has a message for you?
[246:09.15]Um, hold on.
[246:15.53]It's a message from Mr. Green.
[246:17.37]Let me see what it is.
[246:29.06]Okay.
[246:31.42]What is it?
[246:38.32]Why is it so small?
[246:49.54]Response required. Good evening Mr. Elbertson.
[246:52.54]Sponsored by Greg Greens.
[246:54.54]It has come to our attention that you have yet to make a debt payment since May 8th 2021.
[246:59.54]This letter serves to notify you that continued non-payment will have consequences.
[247:03.54]You have one hour to make a deal with chat to remove a portion of your debt balance.
[247:07.54]Failure to comply with these terms would result in repossession of all Funko Pop vinyl figures in your possession.
[247:11.54]Chat rides a ban from all greens affiliated gambling companies, as well as a lawsuit from Warner Bros. for copyright infringement.
[247:18.60]We hope you make the correct decision.
[247:19.92]Sincerely, Greg Green.
[247:28.49]Okay.
[247:29.79]Appreciate the letter.
[247:35.87]Can I play a monkey video?
[247:41.72]No, I said I wasn't going to do that.
[247:43.00]Not a monkey video.
[247:43.70]I'm not playing that.
[247:45.34]Something else.
[247:46.14]Something else.
[247:46.80]I'm not playing a monkey video.
[247:49.80]Nothing else.
[247:54.00]You want me to fulfill the meme destiny is what you want me to do.
[247:59.48]How much would you take off?
[248:16.06]Just make your own monkey video?
[248:21.06]100 million, come on.
[248:25.88]Okay, I picked a random one.
[248:34.33]We're only gonna watch a little bit, I promise.
[248:41.47]Baby back rib stream?
[248:44.85]Brush your teeth if you don't want to go to fucking jail.
[248:51.74]Okay, 100 million off the debt.
[248:53.86]How much off the debt?
[249:00.84]500 million?
[249:02.64]250 million.
[249:05.64]He's fucking smoking a cigarette.
[249:15.93]Um, what?
[249:17.07]I don't want to watch this one.
[249:20.35]I don't want to watch that one.
[249:32.80]What the fuck?
[249:36.70]That was... What do you mean no deal?
[249:39.54]Hold on.
[249:39.90]I'm buying a different one.
[249:45.77]Do monkey reacting to magic strikes?
[249:59.81]You idiot.
[250:09.70]This is so stupid.
[250:10.84]Why?
[250:11.16]Okay, this is monkeys reacting to magic tricks.
[250:27.01]I feel like I've seen- hasn't everybody seen this video like 10 times?
[250:35.45]He just gave me the eye ball.
[250:43.52]Get the fuck out of here What the fuck I stop I don't want to keep clicking I put on
[251:00.74]I don't know!
[251:01.32]I don't have- I had Adblock, I think, but I don't have it anymore.
[251:05.18]Let's see what this funny monkey does.
[251:16.96]He's built into the video.
[251:34.06]He just ate it!
[251:34.96]What did he just eat?
[251:37.50]I swear to god if a monkey starts smoking in this video, I'm just running away.
[251:40.79]There better be no smoking monkeys.
[252:03.32]I'm not even a monkey and that just freaked me out.
[252:07.15]I'm shocked by that.
[252:08.43]I'm not even the chimpanzee.
[252:11.45]That's pumped in fake audio, by the way.
[252:12.95]That's fake audio.
[252:18.75]Why would they need to... Everyone's seen that one.
[252:30.26]Okay.
[252:33.77]He's like, no way!
[252:35.47]He's scratching his butt.
[252:38.17]He's like, I don't even care.
[252:39.61]Alright, Wes, do it.
[252:42.55]Oh, you're boring.
[252:43.31]I can't do it.
[252:44.45]He's ignoring you.
[252:45.48]Okay, do it.
[252:54.69]These are paid actors, talking about the monkeys?
[253:16.92]That looked fun to do.
[253:18.78]Wait, what?
[253:19.18]What happened?
[253:22.96]That's not a magic trick.
[253:23.90]That's just like you just fucking with the monkey.
[253:26.06]Where is this?
[253:28.70]Is this music coming from me?
[253:30.50]I don't know where this music is coming from.
[253:54.75]Do I have another video open?
[254:05.52]I thought that was a big pipe in his hand.
[254:07.50]I was like, not another smoking monkey.
[254:08.84]I thought that was a big Gandalf pipe.
[254:13.82]That's not, that's a kitten.
[254:24.81]What is this?
[254:25.21]This is cats looking at toys.
[254:40.36]I think they did you run out of monkey magic clips and just be like, you know what?
[254:44.03]I got a few of these.
[254:44.75]What do you mean the deal is off?
[254:53.25]That's not fair.
[255:08.30]Why are the cats- the cats are getting mad at each other because the-
[255:16.25]What the fuck?
[255:16.99]What's going on?
[255:17.58]Why are dental companies lobbying to make this toothbrush illegal in the U.S.?
[255:21.48]What?
[255:21.66]Toothbrush is illegal?
[255:24.20]...to give Americans the dental care they deserve.
[255:25.92]What is this?
[255:26.96]And he destroyed the $300 billion dental monopoly in the process with a device that can deep clean your teeth in just 10 seconds.
[255:43.68]What's happening?
[255:46.04]Stop auto-playing.
[255:53.55]Illegal toothbrush.
[255:57.11]Okay.
[255:58.19]I did what I needed to do.
[256:03.95]I did it.
[256:04.27]There you go.
[256:10.45]It's been done.
[256:21.73]I need to pay back attention.
[256:23.90]Okay, I have another skill point to put somewhere.
[256:26.62]I don't know where to put it, though.
[256:28.30]What do you think?
[256:34.12]What is this stream today?
[256:35.16]It's been all over the place, hasn't it?
[256:40.48]Yeah, I don't know.
[256:42.55]But tomorrow's is going to be way weirder.
[256:44.05]Because again, to remind you, tomorrow is public domain movie night.
[256:47.72]We're just going to watch a bunch of public domain movies.
[256:51.16]Horror themed.
[256:52.60]Obviously for Halloween.
[256:55.38]Should be very interesting.
[256:58.00]I think I want to do the heal.
[257:03.28]That doesn't seem like very much.
[257:06.58]Heal 25% instead of 20% for a point.
[257:08.80]That feels like not very much.
[257:22.96]Does anybody else have a heal?
[257:24.85]Maybe I should upgrade this.
[257:30.67]He feels kind of lackluster.
[257:32.15]Oh, we're going just poison, poison, poison, poison, poison.
[257:39.25]Poison, poison, poison, poison, poison, poison.
[257:42.69]That's four, right?
[257:43.51]Yeah.
[257:48.58]Alright, route.
[257:49.68]This is...
[257:52.27]Tangle minus 20% resistance to that.
[257:56.79]Well, I just I don't want to do that one The farms and fields of our kingdom overrun with putrescence and rot What time is oh, yeah, this is important.
[258:11.77]So the stream tomorrow Is not gonna be at 2 I want to do it at night
[258:19.25]I want it to be in the evening into the night time because we're watching scary movies.
[258:27.14]So we're gonna start tomorrow around 5 p.m.
[258:30.74]Pacific.
[258:32.22]So 8 p.m.
[258:33.36]Eastern is when we're starting.
[258:34.52]Gonna be a scary night.
[258:47.78]He hates EU.
[258:53.72]It's the Halloween special.
[258:56.24]I'm not gonna stream at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon on the Halloween special.
[259:00.08]No, I wanted to do it at night.
[259:01.14]I wanted it to be scary.
[259:09.99]I can't help that you're plus like 12 hours ahead of me.
[259:16.55]Your Halloween will already be over.
[259:18.01]You already got to do it.
[259:19.65]No, it'll be Halloween Day at that point.
[259:20.91]Yeah, wait, it'll be Halloween Day at that point.
[259:22.65]Time zones aren't real.
[259:28.98]If you cared, you'd wait 12 hours.
[259:30.88]I live in West Coast United States, which is the furthest away from Europe in America you could possibly be.
[259:42.61]That's when I stream.
[259:43.53]I'm very sorry.
[259:45.44]But I want it to be in the evening.
[259:46.70]Because I want the sun to be down.
[259:48.54]I want the lights to be off.
[259:49.42]And I want to be fucking terrified.
[259:50.82]Alright, is it time to go?
[259:59.69]I upgraded everybody, right?
[260:01.49]Did this.
[260:02.12]Do I even have to buy anything?
[260:06.36]I don't.
[260:08.30]West Coast, Nevada is landlocked.
[260:14.36]Yeah, but it's on Pacific time.

[261:11.38]I'm ready.
[261:14.58]Journey onward.
[261:18.21]I think I'm gonna get to the boss.
[261:30.81]Are you gonna do a facecam tomorrow?
[261:31.96]Maybe for parts.
[261:32.72]Wait, wait, wait.
[261:35.10]What's going on?
[261:37.48]Wait.
[261:39.10]What's happening?
[261:44.75]Duh.
[261:48.07]It's a new... It's a new thing.
[261:53.49]Oh.
[261:54.83]I completed it.
[261:57.34]I just didn't do the boss.
[261:59.56]Oh shit.
[262:00.00]Alright, well let's see how far we can get.
[262:05.92]Hero Shrine.
[262:06.50]Alright, they all want to go to Hero Shrine.
[262:08.12]Except for you, but whatever.
[262:09.14]I might be able to complete the Plague Doctor's story.
[262:14.98]I should do somebody else to get another move.
[262:26.35]Who will face the half-remembered horrors of their past?
[262:31.57]Okay, so who should do it then?
[262:36.53]Highwayman?
[262:36.89]I'll do Highwayman.
[262:40.75]I want more damage.
[262:42.61]I feel like I can't kill anything.

[263:04.76]Don't do that.

[265:47.85]That's actually not good at all.
[265:48.89]I need to kill these guys now.
[265:50.25]How do I go?
[265:50.63]I have to walk backwards, I think.
[265:53.33]Not yet.
[265:53.67]In a minute, I will.
[265:58.45]God, I can just move back.
[266:00.08]You're right.
[266:15.03]I got too cocky and I didn't move.
[266:32.39]Whoops.
[266:32.69]It's okay.
[266:33.19]I'm fine.
[266:43.97]Crit!
[266:46.83]Crit him!
[266:48.78]Crit him!
[266:49.04]How much health does he have?
[266:51.76]Four.
[266:52.46]He's dead.
[267:01.11]He would be a fugitive.
[267:02.55]Point blank shot if he were in front.
[267:05.41]But a free one nonetheless.
[267:16.10]Have choices at least it should be additions.
[267:20.30]Oh, yeah, this is bad Let me put that on Now the new strategy with this guy is You Lunge forward and then point-blank shot.
[267:38.65]We need a move.
[267:39.11]Can I make hacking?
[267:39.91]I want to move party members around
[267:47.67]Take aim.
[267:49.27]No, move forward, take aim, point blank.
[267:50.87]What should I get rid of with this?
[267:58.89]These are all useful.
[267:59.55]Okay, let's go.
[268:04.68]Hospital.
[268:08.64]Hospital.
[268:12.16]Let's try that tactic.
[268:12.98]This is a stress heal, right?
[268:35.94]Or it's a 50-50 shot for a stress heal.
[268:37.86]Let's try this thing that I want to do.
[268:39.74]Boom.
[268:41.58]A game.
[268:42.90]Hit somebody in the head.
[268:46.38]That cat.
[268:48.81]Jerma chat is going crazy.
[268:50.01]Hey.
[268:52.35]Relax.
[268:53.13]Relax.
[268:53.53]What are you doing?
[268:54.83]Okay.
[269:09.88]It's alright.
[269:11.44]Get out of here.
[269:20.46]No!
[269:20.76]This game is balls.
[269:26.36]Sorry, bud.
[269:31.73]I'm getting to the point where I have an assessment of the video game.
[269:34.75]Can I make an assessment of the video game, please?
[269:49.34]I killed that motherfucker.
[269:54.56]Condition blocked?
[269:57.24]That's weird.
[269:57.94]He'll die from that and then we just have to realize that there's only one skeleton left.
[270:09.01]That was pretty clean.
[270:17.27]Didn't even get to use point blank, point blank, whatever.
[270:20.93]Twice.
[270:24.03]Executed with impunity.
[270:30.66]You should play it off stream to give a genuine, real judgment.
[270:41.35]We fucked it up.
[270:58.98]field hospital and cakes oh you just make them interesting okay uh somebody has a really bad illness and stress damage oh it's the it's the blind one where is it
[271:31.32]I don't think I can afford these anyways, no.
[271:36.51]Only eat the flapjacks at the, uh... You said gym.
[271:46.46]What happened to the blind thing?
[271:50.36]Did he get taken over by something else?
[272:01.22]Maybe I'll... It's a disease, not a quirk.
[272:07.23]Oh.
[272:10.61]Right.
[272:11.47]Okay.
[272:11.99]Let's go.
[272:35.08]I can't afford to remove the disease now.
[272:36.48]I couldn't.
[272:37.70]What does it want me to do here?
[272:42.58]I get a new trinket?
[272:45.10]Why do they have, um... I don't know.
[272:58.92]The loathing howls.
[273:00.49]Every time I kind of progress a little more, I get another one of these.
[273:03.77]It seems like a negative.
[273:07.40]Uh-oh.
[273:07.66]Is this the end?
[273:10.60]No.
[273:23.63]Here we go.
[273:28.15]You need stronger enemies.
[273:30.95]Are you blight resistant?
[273:31.93]Kind of.
[273:32.37]Eh, go for it.
[273:34.25]Roll the dice.
[273:35.11]50-50.
[273:35.33]Eh.
[273:42.25]Yeah, you're gonna die.
[273:47.77]Hopeful.
[273:52.31]Fine.
[273:58.09]Yes!
[274:09.12]The animations are cool.
[274:11.81]I think it's, yeah.
[274:14.13]The one thing, okay, you ready for assessment Andy?
[274:17.02]Okay, here comes assessment Andy.
[274:21.95]I think everybody thought Darkest Dungeon 2 was going to be Darkest Dungeon 1, but with more stuff.
[274:31.15]And this is a very, very completely different video game.
[274:34.21]This system here is kind of the same, but it's a lot different.
[274:43.38]Instead of them doing that same formula from the first game and making it bigger,
[274:49.33]They made essentially a whole new... This reminds me of Slay the Spire.
[274:55.48]I feel like this game... Okay, so... This stuff here... Like, block 50% less damage from next hit.
[275:04.72]Evade.
[275:05.62]Crit.
[275:07.08]These... It's kind of... Almost like these are cards.
[275:11.49]Like, this is a card game.
[275:16.91]I feel like I'm playing Slay the Spire.
[275:24.23]It's literally the same system.
[275:25.69]It's not though.
[275:34.44]It's Slay the Spire with a Dungeon... Darkest Dungeon coat of paint.
[275:41.58]Especially considering that you don't make a party.
[275:43.56]You just kind of start with a party and you have to go as far as you can and then do the whole thing all over again.
[275:48.86]They removed the whole... Like it's... It's a very different game.
[275:55.53]This system is intact, but it lives in a different kind of universe.
[276:09.29]You do make a party.
[276:11.59]Well, I mean, you make the party, but you don't really... Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.
[276:18.59]You could have, like, two Plague Doctors in the last one, because you just had a shitload of people would show up at the Hamlet.
[276:24.81]Do you get to have just one of each particular character?
[276:28.31]Can you have, like, two Plague Doctors or two Highwaymen or whatever?
[276:31.03]Can you still do that?
[276:32.65]Or is it just one?
[276:37.37]It's one of each.
[276:42.83]Yeah, it feels...
[276:46.62]I don't know.
[276:47.10]I'm still working on how I feel about it.
[276:51.09]I do personally miss... Like, you'd go to the cart and be like, who's here today?
[276:56.69]And like, oh shit, okay, I can run these guys through the level one dungeon.
[277:00.00]I'll make a party of like fucking two plague doctors and like two abominations.
[277:03.08]Fuck it, let's go.
[277:05.12]This feels more like a... You start like this, and this is the way you're going to start.
[277:10.20]And like, good luck.
[277:11.60]The run might be like two hours.
[277:24.56]feels it peels and may you know maybe they okay so Darkest Dungeon is amazing alright let's let's break this down Darkest Dungeon is awesome it's really really really good you have to consider maybe that the dev was devs are probably saying to themselves
[277:48.61]Everybody fucking loves Darkest Dungeon 1.
[277:51.61]It's a complete amazing experience.
[277:54.99]If they did Darkest Dungeon 1 again with better art style and the same exact systems, maybe it's possible that they don't live up to that game and it's just kind of like a bad version of the first one.
[278:10.04]Right?
[278:10.54]Maybe they get to that point where they're like, fuck, are we just going to make another Darkest Dungeon?
[278:14.33]But what if it's not as good as the first one?
[278:17.80]So, alright, let's try something different and see what happens.
[278:21.72]Let's try something new and not just kind of make a potential, even if they made a better version so we still have that one.
[278:33.34]I can see where people are sort of confused at like, why do we have a gigantic like 40 thing like lay the spire tree?
[278:43.10]I want to make my five, I want to make my four highwayman team.
[278:47.52]Like, a lot of, I think, choices, at least in party, and kind of where you decide you want to go, are chosen for you.
[278:58.51]Yeah.
[278:59.83]I mean, Darkest Dungeon 1 got a bunch of stuff, a bunch of contents.
[279:02.95]I feel like 1 was unintentionally that difficult, but it was meant to be hard.
[279:08.85]2 is intentionally, radically hard.
[279:11.57]Well, we talked about it earlier.
[279:12.43]I feel like it's...
[279:14.51]If you're gonna have a game that you do a one run and then start the whole thing over again, it kind of has to have some aspects of, like, you can't really do it on your first try.
[279:27.05]Right?
[279:28.19]Otherwise, you would just beat the whole thing on your first go.
[279:35.88]So you hate it.
[279:40.66]Here's the thing.
[279:42.24]I imagine that once you play through this game like 10 to 20 times, you do like 20 runs, maybe the game is kind of open enough where a lot of these complaints might not exist anymore.
[279:57.40]Because right now, we're all taking this like, oh, Darkest Dungeon 2!
[280:00.08]Here we go!
[280:00.78]Oh, man, I'm gonna have, like, fucking 15 people.
[280:02.96]They're gonna all be doing different things.
[280:04.18]Some of them are, like, in the, uh, in the, uh, asylum.
[280:07.71]Some of them are getting their disease treated.
[280:09.35]Okay, I got these guys.
[280:10.53]It's like, well, here's your party.
[280:11.99]Now play the game for four hours in one run.
[280:16.07]I think we need to see the rest of it, right?
[280:19.17]Because it just came out in early access.
[280:22.39]I wonder what else they're going to do to maybe alleviate some of the concerns people have.
[280:27.36]They're the only one who thought that.
[280:35.38]It's only chapter one.
[280:36.28]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[280:37.84]I'm just trying to give benefit to the doubt of why maybe some people are saying that they don't like it.
[280:45.48]It feels like we need the rest of the story.
[280:48.24]The rest of the kind of world to be built.
[280:50.86]Because I get what they're doing.
[280:57.15]I get where they're going.
[280:58.81]They want that like one run, sort of like Slay the Spire, like Isaac, where you start, you go, and you just, can I fucking get to the end?
[281:08.88]Rather than, I have like four or five different groups that are doing these small like 10 to 15 minute dungeons.
[281:16.04]No, no, no.
[281:16.52]It's like a one and done, let's go, how far can you get?
[281:19.99]Have you ever played Slay the Spire?
[281:21.35]No.
[281:22.89]I downloaded it on my Switch and I played it for 15 minutes.
[281:35.25]But listen to me talk to you like I'm someone with experience and I'm someone to listen to.
[281:40.41]Like you should be listening to me.
[281:42.66]I'm talking really in a way that you should be paying attention to every word that I say.
[281:47.14]I don't have any money so I can't do anything.
[282:05.92]But it's different enough, but still kind of similar.
[282:12.96]I'm very hopeful that over the next, you know, whatever, year or so, however long it takes and finishes, or maybe even more than that, that a lot of these systems and a lot of these areas and a lot of the characters get added and fleshed out.
[282:24.57]I have pretty decent hopes.
[282:29.58]I think it's going to be alright.
[282:36.18]ChunkyVlogna.
[282:37.74]ChunkyVlogna, thanks for the 20 community subs, Chunky.
[282:40.88]You doing well?
[282:46.93]Make a funny noise, please.
[282:50.39]Alright, you're stealth.
[282:53.65]I can't hurt you.
[282:54.11]Alright.
[282:56.54]Poisoned.
[283:09.83]Alright, the one real complaint that I really truly have about this game is I kind of miss from the first game being confident in my ability to complete dungeons.
[283:24.57]Because if you just went to a level 1 dungeon to grind for some stuff, you were confident that you were just going to be able to clear that and get...
[283:34.73]and get, like, money and relics and stuff, right?
[283:38.63]This is one of those, like, you've got to play, play, play, play to make your characters better.
[283:43.23]You can't really do it in one go.
[283:45.39]You really can't.
[283:49.74]I much prefer the ability to kind of steady yourself at my own pace, decide how difficult I want to make the experience.
[284:00.68]Opinion Andy, that's me.
[284:13.65]I mean, you have opinions sometimes.
[284:19.01]You absolutely can beat this game in your first run ever.
[284:21.56]I'm sure you can, but it's exponentially more difficult than just running a dungeon in the first game.
[284:26.62]I feel like a lot of things have to go right.
[284:46.47]gets a lot easier with unlocks.
[284:48.55]Oh, yeah.
[284:49.19]I'm certain it does.
[284:50.13]But easier is probably the wrong word.
[284:53.05]It's more options to be able to do things.
[284:57.65]What do you have?
[285:00.81]Alright, you're dead.
[285:01.35]Okay.
[285:10.61]I definitely like it.
[285:11.45]I like it.
[285:14.33]I'm very intrigued to see more.
[285:16.98]I want to see more.
[285:17.92]I want to see what they do with the rest of it.
[285:28.96]It's just, if you really loved the first game, you kind of have to, like, just... Just forget about it and try to play this one and enjoy it.
[285:38.08]It's like everyone else is doing.
[285:39.26]I am comparing every single thing to the experience I had in the first one.
[285:43.39]Which, I mean, obviously it's Darkest Dungeon 2.
[285:45.69]It's not like Darkest Dungeon, colon, right?
[285:48.89]This is not a colon experience.
[285:53.69]This is a 2.
[285:59.52]If it was Darkest Dungeon, colon, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, then it'd be like, okay, wait, this is a different thing.
[286:06.24]So I understand it's two.
[286:16.26]Darkest Dungeon, colon, on the road to insanity.
[286:21.31]Instead of Darkest Dungeon 2.
[286:22.89]Shut up, Redditor.
[286:24.75]Okay.
[286:34.78]Okay, fine.
[286:36.19]Let's just play.
[286:39.39]How much torch do I even have?
[286:44.55]No, I don't want it.
[286:45.21]Look at the torch.
[286:47.27]47?
[286:48.23]Are you going to play the Outer Wilds DLC?
[287:03.89]Probably not.
[287:13.36]How far am I?
[287:15.47]Order.
[287:16.39]Where's the lair?
[287:19.01]I gotta pee.
[287:19.73]I'll be right back.
[289:50.66]every piss is a huge Tom hanks a league of their own hangover Pete that's the most specific reference I've heard since I started broadcasting on Twitch
[290:10.08]That was... what an insane reference.
[290:14.03]Okay.
[290:22.35]Let's keep going.
[290:25.72]I'm just gonna... avoid the hoarder.
[290:29.76]Oh, shit.
[290:30.20]Did I... I got it?
[290:31.00]Nice.
[290:43.68]Academic cash.
[290:44.54]Trinkets?
[290:44.98]Ooh, I'll take it.
[290:47.04]Okay, avoid the hoarder.
[290:49.16]So, let's go left.
[290:50.85]Ooh!
[291:16.08]Alright, let's do it.
[291:17.59]What are we getting?
[291:20.23]The last time we were here, you all died?
[291:21.97]Uh... These enemies are a lot easier than the other ones.
[291:34.68]Like, I'm destroying these guys.
[291:38.24]That first zone that I was in, or the second one, was ridiculous.
[291:41.97]Was I not supposed to be there?
[291:45.75]Can you eat something crunchy for us?
[292:00.48]No, half people in the world love that, half people in the world hate it.
[292:03.08]I think I'll abstain from doing that.
[292:06.73]There is comfort in company.
[292:12.99]Let's do a little dash.
[292:15.91]I might blank this guy.
[292:26.78]Stress heal on yourself.
[292:30.04]Oh, come on, Gwyn.
[292:31.08]What is this?
[292:41.65]Will the Blight still hit?
[292:42.61]Can I throw it?
[292:46.33]Oh, even if you stealth.
[292:47.13]Okay, cool.
[292:54.67]Are you going to beat Orphan of Kos on stream?
[293:03.18]No.
[293:10.66]Crunchy?
[293:11.00]What's the crunchiest shit ever?
[293:15.11]Hmm.
[293:16.17]Let me see.
[293:16.43]What's the crunchiest thing you've ever eaten?
[293:22.37]Probably one of those little bread ovals.
[293:26.14]Like little crostinis.
[293:28.64]If they're a little bit stale, they feel like they're going to break your teeth when you bite in and you snap off.
[293:33.60]Those are probably the crunchiest.
[293:42.83]I didn't like that.
[293:43.57]Who wants to put that on?
[293:44.51]You do.
[293:44.77]I'll take it.
[294:06.20]Save booms.
[294:06.96]It'll be funny.
[294:07.56]Booms.
[294:10.16]Oh, booms.
[294:13.97]And I have a 10-hitter store.
[294:15.07]I need booms.
[294:17.59]There.
[294:21.37]Academic study.
[294:22.21]I kind of don't want to do this.
[294:25.07]Whoa, wait a minute.
[294:27.06]Crank it, Chance.
[294:29.72]Oh, let's leave.
[294:36.14]Academic Study, Hero Shrine.
[294:37.74]Yeah, let's do Hero Shrine.
[294:39.64]I'm thinking we do the Plague Doctors last.
[294:45.52]Or no.
[294:46.14]Maybe somebody else.
[294:47.46]Iron Man again.
[294:48.02]Man-at-arms.
[295:11.67]Prove you're real.
[295:13.05]Okay.
[295:13.31]Facecam?
[295:14.22]I already did a facecam today.
[295:37.86]The politics of a military career are perhaps as treacherous as war itself.
[295:44.47]Yeah, can you prove you're real?
[295:48.13]Why do I have to do it and you don't?
[295:50.63]Through a dubious campaign of influence and intimidation, he had at last claimed a coveted command and was eager to bask in the glory of the victories that were sure to come.
[296:06.74]I passed the captcha.
[296:08.66]Oh, okay.
[296:09.48]Yeah, I didn't have to do a captcha.
[296:10.90]I'm streaming.
[296:15.27]Hello.
[296:17.23]This is remove the post and minus three speed.
[296:22.24]It's everybody.
[296:23.08]Cool.
[296:33.41]Hospital or unknown.
[296:35.21]I don't think I have enough money to do anything.
[296:36.77]I think we're going this way.
[296:40.52]We'll do unknown.
[296:47.34]I don't need the hospital.
[296:49.84]Unknown.
[296:56.02]Are you a pre-recorded Andy?
[296:58.38]No.
[297:01.34]Not right now.
[297:06.13]Oh, you shuffled me around.
[297:07.21]I don't like that.
[297:16.78]Really?
[297:21.08]You really get the luckiest road battles?
[297:22.92]That's a good thing.
[297:31.86]Wait, did you just point blank shot somebody that was far away?
[297:34.27]How does that make sense?
[297:47.40]I want you to move.
[297:52.72]What?
[297:58.27]There it is.
[298:03.95]Yeah, you're dead.
[298:16.72]I... Yeah.
[298:24.56]Well, you can't do anything.
[298:28.94]Bork effect bark disease.
[298:30.86]What?
[298:31.78]What was... Bork de... Bork effect?
[298:33.70]Bork effect?
[298:47.76]Bark effect, bark, bark.
[298:53.09]Nice.
[298:55.39]Rest.
[298:55.93]De-rest.
[298:57.85]Ooh, 10%.
[298:59.21]I'll take that.
[299:07.51]You should definitely put that on.
[299:08.79]I want you to hurt things, please.
[299:14.95]I think this is carrying the whole run.
[299:20.45]This is your conscience speaking.
[299:21.66]You want to order a long chicken from Burger King tonight.
[299:26.60]I don't.
[299:28.06]I really don't.
[299:28.82]I'm on this antibiotic and it's fucking me up.
[299:33.11]What's going on?
[299:36.37]What happened?
[299:38.31]Did I get ambushed or something?
[299:40.29]Did I get ambushed or something?
[299:44.11]Give stimulants to you.
[299:45.15]I want you to go fast.
[299:50.57]I want you to bolster.
[299:54.64]I want you to take aim.
[299:56.56]I want you to go forward.
[300:05.66]Oh, no, no, no.
[300:07.02]They have a stupid thing on.
[300:08.56]How do I get it off?
[300:15.83]My dear.
[300:16.46]My love.
[300:23.64]Two large fries.
[300:24.68]Did you really just fuck everything up?
[300:27.56]Alright.
[300:29.09]We need to start doing some blood bleeding here.
[300:32.39]Dodge 75%.
[300:34.73]Dodge.
[300:34.85]Jesus.
[300:34.97]Jesus.
[300:47.21]How am I supposed to take care of this?
[300:54.24]I can't.
[300:56.40]I didn't dodge it.
[300:57.38]That was actually really lucky.
[300:58.36]Holy shit.
[300:59.96]Alright, now give me a riposte.
[301:09.71]Alright, shut that down.
[301:20.20]Just go for it.
[301:25.93]I'm going to take aim and I'm going to blow this guy's brains out.
[301:30.45]After we get rid of that.
[301:31.41]Are you talking like that?
[301:34.79]What am I doing?
[301:51.25]Okay.
[301:53.10]Or you're dead.
[301:54.12]Or you're almost dead.
[301:56.88]But this is a 75% chance I'm not going to be able to go through that.
[301:59.10]God damn it.
[302:04.86]We're just going to have to take this off you.
[302:06.50]Come on.
[302:08.70]How do I get that off?
[302:21.14]Take that shit off.
[302:23.78]Thank you.
[302:25.28]Oh, man.
[302:33.35]Good night.
[302:35.73]Speed.
[302:44.70]Ulster.
[302:53.02]Point blank.
[302:55.54]That's really good.
[302:59.92]I thought this was a birdwatching stream.
[303:05.45]You've changed.
[303:07.95]Yes, I have.
[303:08.83]Many times over the course of my life.
[303:11.89]You're right.
[303:18.05]Mmmmm.
[303:25.56]Guard the Highwayman?
[303:30.84]What happened?
[303:38.49]If you do a 10-hour birdwatching experience, that's not going to happen.
[303:44.59]You might get a 3-4 hour birdwatching experience.
[303:48.51]Maybe one day, if I feel like it.
[303:55.50]You're definitely getting the baby sensory video stream.
[304:02.66]Absolutely.
[304:03.58]I'm gonna try to do this as fast as I can.
[304:04.85]Kill him.
[304:22.11]Alright, death's door, but you're gonna blight.
[304:27.37]Death's door again?
[304:29.07]Come on.
[304:29.47]Just die already.
[304:37.07]Forty flame, nice.
[304:38.05]Ooh.
[304:38.62]Just have the ability to put on a trinket.
[304:49.00]The low-rank besters.
[304:52.39]You have to do the don't call Jerma at 3 AM video.
[304:58.09]I buy this game right now.
[304:59.53]My fingers on the button.
[305:13.68]I mean, do you like?
[305:14.44]I don't know.
[305:15.32]I can't tell you what to buy and what not to buy.
[305:19.62]Vulnerable.
[305:21.42]Let's go.
[305:30.30]Not seeing this guy.
[305:35.01]50% more damage from the next hit.
[305:35.97]This is huge.
[305:40.16]Oh, come on.
[305:58.59]You gonna play Outer Wilds DLC?
[306:00.03]I don't know.
[306:02.82]I'm not playing Outer Wilds DLC.
[306:06.70]Holy shit.
[306:13.43]Okay, I would say if you're a big fan of Darkest Dungeon and the Darkest Dungeon lore and world and a lot of its core gameplay mechanics, yes.
[306:23.92]But everybody else, I would say maybe wait a little bit longer until they flesh out some of the things they want to flesh out.
[306:31.32]But I like it.
[306:35.74]I think this is fun.
[306:38.46]It takes a little longer to do things than the other game, but I feel like that's intentional.
[306:42.73]I don't know.
[306:43.55]I think it's pretty good.
[306:46.97]I am enjoying it.
[306:51.51]For what it is, right?
[306:53.81]I don't want to say that the game sucks or that it's fantastic.
[306:58.90]Because you can't just read... Okay, if I came up with a book.
[307:02.64]And that book was called... The Life and Times of Jeremy Elbertson.
[307:06.97]And it was a fantasy novel with an adventure with Otto.
[307:11.35]And I released the book.
[307:13.93]And I said, hey, it's not done yet, though.
[307:15.23]And you guys are like, what does that mean?
[307:17.61]And you go through chapter 1 and chapter 2.
[307:19.21]And I say it's going to be a 20-chapter book.
[307:22.63]And at the end of chapter 2... There's just 150 blank pages...
[307:30.63]What would you say?
[307:34.87]Well, first of all, I would have just, like, scammed you.
[307:37.05]But on every page it says, coming soon, next chapter coming soon, next chapter coming soon, next chapter coming soon.
[307:50.38]Like, you don't know what happens.
[307:54.88]You just know what happens, like, very early on.
[308:09.19]And for some cases, I mean, this is very early.
[308:13.07]Right?
[308:13.29]There's a lot more of this that's gonna happen eventually.
[308:23.02]Oh, and by the way, throughout the whole first, like, two chapters, there's typos everywhere.
[308:31.35]And it's got weird odd spacing.
[308:34.94]But the story and the thing that you're reading is actually like, this is kind of good.
[308:39.19]This is alright.
[308:39.79]Triple spaces after periods.
[309:06.17]Not sponsored?
[309:06.85]No, that's not a sponsored one.
[309:09.39]And with all that being said, I will tell you, I said it already.
[309:15.33]I prefer the other game.
[309:33.30]I like just like constant upgrades everywhere the currency of being like do I want to upgrade the carriage the characters the healing places that I like the hamlet and like using the portraits that you get the relics that you get it I love that system so but this is a different completely different system I prefer the other system that doesn't mean I don't think this game is any good
[310:02.32]It's just I have a preference for the other kind of system.
[310:06.47]TL;DR.
[310:07.51]I'm not going to read what you said because I don't want to say that out loud because I don't believe it.
[310:14.75]Alright, we need to get rid of this.
[310:24.94]What?
[310:25.80]Why is that still on?
[310:28.50]That shouldn't still be on.
[310:29.24]I should not have taken it off.
[310:35.15]Well, whatever.
[310:41.77]Not to say I like the game.
[311:08.43]Irma hates everything.
[311:18.52]Yeah, the first game was managing people and a place.
[311:21.50]And this one is managing your trip.
[311:25.12]And you're managing your time, I think.
[311:27.44]Right?
[311:29.60]You're managing a trip, not managing your people or your place.
[311:37.55]Holy shit, he's gonna die.
[311:41.21]Oh!
[311:46.08]Oh!
[311:46.18]Oh, no.
[311:46.32]Oh, no.
[311:46.54]Uh...
[312:07.83]I gotta... get that... Alright, heal.
[312:11.76]Should you blind it?
[312:15.30]Can... you can blind a... an inanimate object?
[312:19.42]What just happened?
[312:23.46]Ignore armor... ugh.
[312:27.94]I want to use the absinthe.
[312:30.19]Um...
[312:37.73]I need to heal somebody.
[312:47.79]Oh, come on.
[312:50.32]Oh, this is bad.
[312:55.52]I don't have any heals or anything.
[312:59.50]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[313:04.71]What should I do?
[313:15.36]Uh, who's more important?
[313:16.60]Probably the healer.
[313:19.47]Self-reliance is a rare and wonderful thing.
[313:22.83]Okay.
[313:26.53]Ignores armor.
[313:27.87]God damn it, this shit is in the way.
[313:33.06]Or... Oh, you piece of shit.
[313:38.80]Give me a break.
[313:46.98]Okay, can I... Fuck you.
[313:58.49]What?
[314:00.25]What?
[314:12.69]Why didn't I heal?
[314:13.43]Because I was trying to blind it.
[314:14.74]You guys were saying, blind it, blind it, blind it, blind it.
[314:16.98]Everyone was saying, blind it.
[314:19.40]Didn't I say that you couldn't?
[314:20.54]Why is everybody telling me to do that?
[314:23.44]Everybody was telling me to blind it.
[314:24.86]I have to move.
[314:29.88]Die!
[314:41.00]Cat IQ has room temperature.
[314:42.65]Cat can't rotate a cube in their brain.
[314:49.53]You know that that's one of my favorite comments ever.
[314:51.51]I don't know who it was.
[314:53.55]I don't know who you were.
[314:55.23]You might be here right now.
[314:57.15]But the chat can't rotate a cube in their mind.
[315:00.29]It was just such a funny comment.
[315:03.37]It just was.
[315:10.17]The defense is back on there.
[315:17.39]Um... Ben?
[315:21.99]Something going on between you two?
[315:23.36]Wait, because they're in a relationship?
[315:27.94]Wait, what?
[315:45.31]Alright, ignore, uh, defense.
[315:47.33]Alright, there's two different, there's ignore shield and ignore other shield.
[315:53.99]Guarded?
[315:54.67]Is this guard or block?
[315:55.79]Block, okay.
[316:08.20]Die.
[316:13.06]I can't do it.
[316:14.06]I have to just use this.
[316:14.82]Ah, you missed.
[316:15.38]Jesus.
[316:15.56]That sucked.
[316:43.74]Need a healer.
[316:44.32]I went to the other end.
[316:56.51]That's pretty lucky, yeah.
[317:05.96]Academics.
[317:06.44]I don't want to do this.
[317:07.12]No.
[317:08.38]Nope.
[317:16.23]That's another thing too.
[317:20.01]I feel like I'm not strong enough to do anything.
[317:22.09]I don't want to go in there because I don't want the run to be over.
[317:25.76]Right?
[317:27.60]See, before, I didn't care if I threw four random dickheads into a dungeon and they died.
[317:33.62]I don't want to do that because I'm afraid of having to start the whole thing over again.
[317:37.66]Does that make any sense?
[317:50.08]Just go straight.
[317:56.14]How do you know you can't beat it?
[317:58.82]I feel like I'm not strong enough.
[318:00.22]I don't have any confidence.
[318:10.25]Feels bad to lose when you're playing for this long.
[318:15.33]I don't know.
[318:15.87]I need more time.
[318:17.63]I need more time to process it.
[318:19.13]I can't give you what I really believe.
[318:20.55]Because I feel like it could change.
[318:23.18]But... I don't know.
[318:25.54]I feel like I'm not... I feel like scared to do anything.
[318:28.12]Because there's like too much at stake.
[318:29.22]Okay.
[318:34.66]These are just regular skeletons.
[318:45.43]There's actually nothing at stake.
[318:51.81]Well, I'm... Yeah, but... You have to fight now so you can beat later.
[319:00.59]Yeah, I'm holding on to the fact that I don't want these characters to die.
[319:06.12]So I'm just trying to play safe and just try to get... But playing safe is not going to do much for me.
[319:18.13]None of us believe in you, Jerma.
[319:20.01]You can fail as much as you want.
[319:21.53]It's okay.
[319:22.13]Oh my god.
[319:24.87]Brilliant conclusion.
[319:33.22]Brutal.
[319:33.90]That was brutal.
[319:39.66]Messy, but effective.
[319:46.95]Is it possible that game sucks?
[319:52.75]It's too early.
[319:53.45]I don't know.
[319:54.12]I can't.
[319:54.52]I don't know.
[319:54.86]I don't know.
[319:57.30]It's too early.
[320:04.40]I don't think I can say that.
[320:05.84]No?
[320:05.94]It's better than Hades?
[320:20.86]you can't compare apples to oranges I mean Hades I thought Hades was unbelievable you can't but look you can't say better better than Hades those are two completely different genres I want to kill this guy
[320:50.84]This is way better than Monkey Ball?
[320:53.86]Yeah, sure, I mean... Outer Wilds DLC is better than Hades.
[321:12.65]Okay, but that's tough.
[321:17.53]I mean, it's like, okay, is...
[321:20.75]Is Bambi better than The Departed?
[321:24.25]I don't... I mean, they're two completely different movies.
[321:27.06]They're two completely different things.
[321:34.48]Do you guys remember The Departed?
[321:37.56]I'll The Departed.
[321:40.28]I remember The... Can we talk about The Departed for a second?
[321:44.55]Just for a second?
[321:45.87]If you haven't seen the movie, then just... I mean, I'm going to end the stream after this anyway.
[321:50.18]The Departed is a crazy movie.
[321:54.99]The last, like, 20 minutes of The Departed is some of the most wild, like, ridiculous shit ever.
[322:00.73]Can we talk about it?
[322:07.99]Sure, can we?
[322:09.99]Okay, if you have not seen The Departed, then I would say it's probably time for you to close the stream because we're going to talk about The Departed.
[322:17.97]Boston movie.
[322:19.15]Takes place in Boston.
[322:20.57]It's a crime movie.
[322:21.49]It's about cops.
[322:23.33]It's about fucking crime.
[322:25.21]It's about fucking informants.
[322:28.06]It's about everything.
[322:28.88]It's about having a fucking informant.
[322:31.44]Okay, so let me just tell you.
[322:32.80]Here we go.
[322:33.42]We're going to talk about this for a second.
[322:34.62]I'm telling you.
[322:35.00]There's spoilers for The Departed incoming.
[322:36.86]Here's your warning.
[322:37.52]Your final warning.
[322:40.20]The last 20 minutes of The Departed is a bunch of characters in a row shooting each other in the head.
[322:48.80]Like, one main character to the next main character shoots them in the head.
[322:54.79]It's... It's like the stupidest thing.
[323:00.61]Like, four people get like the, oh yeah, like... It happens like four times in the last 15 minutes.
[323:14.71]Omega lul, Shakespeare ending.
[323:20.46]Yeah, I remember watching it and just saying to myself after they did it like the second or third time They don't do it for a while, and then they like end the movie with it happening like a fourth time And you're just like what?
[323:33.26]Oh, it's fucking departed.
[323:39.78]I'd shoot you in the head main character.
[323:42.16]I shoot other main character in the head I have a main character shoot you in the fucking head
[323:48.56]Hey, it's the end of the fucking movie.
[323:50.24]Hey, you made it all the way this far.
[323:52.41]We just told you about all the stuff.
[323:53.95]All the crazy stuff that happened.
[323:55.61]People died.
[323:56.27]There was informants.
[323:57.45]There was, like, drama going on between, like, three or four different characters.
[324:01.37]I think I'm gonna shoot this guy in the fucking head to end the movie and the credits roll.
[324:06.73]That was the whole last 20 minutes of the movie.
[324:09.93]It was insane.
[324:11.13]If you've never watched The Departed, it's worth you watching just to watch the last 10 to 15 minutes.
[324:22.40]Somebody that was planning to watch The Departed just joined the stream.
[324:32.62]Oh, we're in trouble now.
[324:33.82]Alright.
[324:34.18]I think we'll be alright.
[324:34.84]Let's get a plate safe.
[324:43.07]Well, now I want to see it.
[324:44.25]I mean, it's one of those movies you kind of just have to see.
[324:52.12]Alright, these have to die.
[324:53.34]Let's plan this out.
[324:54.82]I can't do very much blight.
[324:57.00]Although I could try and do the coin flip.
[324:58.81]I'm going to actually go for it because I'm gambling weirdo.
[325:04.17]But let's just start this off by... Let's just kill the frontline.
[325:09.37]Excellent.
[325:13.58]Also, the rat survives to make all the rules.
[325:18.68]Do I heal or... Let's just go for it.
[325:22.80]There it is.
[325:23.38]Sometimes you gotta do the 50-50.
[325:31.08]Why did I do that?
[325:31.64]They can just heal.
[325:32.10]This is bad.
[325:45.96]Although maybe they'll waste a turn eating and not attacking.
[325:58.52]Come on.
[326:01.17]Point blank, point blank, point blank.
[326:06.47]No, don't.
[326:06.85]This guy, he's gonna die.
[326:07.59]24 damage.
[326:29.75]Oh, actually, by the way, we're not... Oh, my God.
[326:32.36]Why is it doing so much damage?
[326:34.20]50%.
[326:34.22]These guys have to die.
[326:35.92]I don't want to point blank that.
[326:41.64]Oh, shit.
[326:42.36]That's really ugly.
[326:50.17]What happened?
[326:51.15]Oh, shit.
[326:53.41]Oh, shit.
[327:03.98]Review the Godfather.
[327:05.08]Uh, what do I mean?
[327:08.88]Review the Godfather.
[327:15.32]Cat puke sound waiting room.
[327:17.24]I just didn't even look at what I did.
[327:21.80]I just got distracted.
[327:22.62]Yeah, I just did.
[327:34.44]How am I supposed to review the Godfather?
[327:36.06]Alright, go for it.
[327:43.30]Damn it.
[327:51.02]Just review it.
[327:53.66]Just say it was better than Hades.
[327:55.68]The Godfather, the movie, is better than Hades, I guess.
[328:01.17]That was good.
[328:15.38]Speed and dodge, good.
[328:33.33]It's actually kind of awful.
[328:49.22]That one should have been mine.
[328:50.94]You're coughing up blood.
[328:51.88]You're almost dead, man.
[328:58.11]Is Godfather better than the rat movie?
[329:02.79]Well, that's up to the critics to decide.
[329:09.15]Die.
[329:13.83]Die.
[329:16.51]Thank you.
[329:19.71]I am not continuing.
[329:21.53]Escape.
[329:26.09]I've been on this run... This is only the second run I've done.
[329:29.20]I've been on this run for the whole stream.
[329:55.38]Spent half the stream looking at monkeys and birds.
[329:57.26]I don't know if I want to do this.
[330:08.76]Ah, this might be the end.
[330:09.54]Can I survive?
[330:18.04]Just move back.
[330:23.40]Smite better than the Godfather Part 3.
[330:36.69]Maybe?
[330:37.03]It's healing for such little.
[330:56.69]What the fuck?
[331:00.53]That's so much damage.
[331:03.26]I had to enrage time around this run.
[331:05.10]Is the Dollhouse stream better than the Godfather movies?
[331:25.94]I don't care.
[331:29.47]Kill the goats quick.
[331:31.27]Kill them.
[331:32.41]Quickly.
[331:53.91]It's not over.
[331:54.39]Not yet.
[331:55.74]Not over yet.
[332:07.30]Everybody just focus on the goat.
[332:10.70]There we go.
[332:19.04]Respectfully.
[332:23.33]You can tell he's bored out of his mind with this game.
[332:26.33]I'm just like playing it.
[332:30.63]I'm just playing the game.
[332:31.87]I gotta move back.
[332:34.14]Here it is.
[332:58.17]Why are you guys doing this, like, either-or thing?
[332:59.85]What do I get to eat?
[333:08.27]A Burger King long chicken.
[333:28.76]Respectful.
[333:30.20]We're scaring 2021?
[333:35.59]No, that's not how it works.
[333:39.09]If you don't like the game, it doesn't work that way.
[333:41.27]Sheep!
[333:54.85]You don't get to decide.
[333:56.11]We do.
[334:02.17]It works however we say it works.
[334:05.87]Goodness.
[334:08.33]Oh my goodness, guys.
[334:09.79]Oh my goodness.
[334:12.74]Controlling much here?
[334:15.34]Excuse me?
[334:18.52]Don't forget who has the keys to this house.
[334:20.91]Don't forget who has the keys to the car.
[334:23.31]Hmm?
[334:24.47]Don't forget.
[334:25.01]My mom does.
[334:31.27]Takes very good care of us.
[334:33.66]So, come on.
[334:34.32]We don't... Come on.
[334:35.80]Hey, come on, punk.
[334:36.90]You don't want to be late to dinner?
[334:38.56]Coming, mom.
[334:41.34]Be there in a minute.
[334:53.85]Escape!
[334:55.84]In this world, wealth is worthless without purpose.
[335:00.02]Quiet, Vessel.
[335:00.82]Review Godfather 2.
[335:02.48]Sure.
[335:03.86]I think, um... Hold on.
[335:07.37]Uh...
[335:27.25]Get rid of this.
[335:27.61]Get rid of this.
[335:34.77]Thank you!
[335:36.70]Almost at the end.
[335:56.28]What's better, Squid Game or ASMR YouTube videos?
[336:00.50]I think I die here.
[336:27.26]Ulster!
[336:34.26]Poor crit.
[336:35.88]Mwah, mwah, we laugh at those.
[336:37.84]Oh shit.
[336:52.13]This is bad.
[336:53.07]They all have a s- oh shit.
[336:57.49]I have to go grenade, right?
[336:58.69]Just to hope it hits somebody?
[336:59.81]No.
[337:09.04]That would have been a big hit.
[337:19.84]Aura.
[337:20.26]Can you say, salmon?
[337:32.97]Whoa, excuse me I can't believe he's still alive Holy shit
[338:04.16]He's bleeding though.
[338:04.92]That's bad.
[338:05.70]Can I heal you with anything?
[338:10.48]Somebody bandage him.
[338:11.39]Somebody do something.
[338:12.05]Do you have a bandage or anything?
[338:15.57]No.
[338:31.22]Hi.
[338:32.62]Oh, come on.
[338:35.00]Thank you.
[338:39.32]Somebody ban that person!
[338:41.12]Is that- Why is that from the... Drunk wine thing?
[338:55.85]Ay.
[338:57.21]Uuugh.
[339:04.22]Help.
[339:24.66]Don't die.
[339:25.36]I think he's dead.
[339:29.00]Oh, my God.
[339:32.10]This guy is invincible.
[339:52.56]He can do anything.
[339:56.52]Alright.
[340:00.00]Do not kill him.
[340:01.06]Oh.
[340:03.04]Bork, bark, bark, bork.
[340:16.07]That door.
[340:19.09]Oh.
[340:20.95]Oh, that's right.
[340:21.49]Good.
[340:22.53]Good gamer.
[340:23.19]Good gaming.
[340:23.83]Stay alive.
[340:49.78]Now do not do something stupid and just kill him in one hit.
[340:55.54]Don't.
[341:06.69]Believe we have done it.
[341:17.79]Run saved.
[341:21.12]And the inn is right around the corner.
[341:28.12]Very nice.
[341:31.26]Get to the inn.
[341:39.62]Too much shit.
[341:40.18]I need to get to the inn now.
[341:42.18]Way too much stuff.
[341:42.80]Get rid of this.
[341:51.27]Get rid of this too.
[341:53.74]Made it.
[342:01.20]Alright.
[342:17.93]Yield to 25%.
[342:20.05]Bont.
[342:21.38]Plus 20% damage next region.
[342:22.92]That actually sounds pretty nice.
[342:26.22]Finally, I can spend some baubles.
[342:29.74]Alright, what do we got?
[342:33.30]Supplies for the quest.
[342:34.32]Okay.
[342:35.81]Thank you.
[342:37.57]Alright.
[342:40.91]So, I have four pancakes.
[342:53.48]Minus one stress.
[342:57.34]Okay.
[343:00.83]Plus resistance till next in.
[343:03.11]Let's give it to you.
[343:08.05]And then high chance of +2.
[343:09.99]Oh, fuck.
[343:10.65]Okay, well, hopefully that doesn't happen.
[343:11.87]Nice.
[343:14.94]Did he skip the boss?
[343:15.94]I think I might have.
[343:18.82]I don't know.
[343:23.68]Whoa, I got seven points.
[343:27.90]Point blank?
[343:31.46]Yeah, let's upgrade that.

[344:05.06]Bend, yeah.
[344:11.16]Pistol shot, yeah.
[344:18.30]Poison dart's already upgraded.
[344:19.30]Bro dagger?
[344:21.70]Probably.
[344:34.64]Can you only upgrade stuff once?
[344:35.76]I feel like that's good.
[344:54.85]I feel like this is all fine now.
[345:01.63]Take aim.

[347:55.48]I do need... Yeah, here we go.
[348:02.08]Okay, let's go to you.
[348:03.46]I feel like I don't do this.
[348:06.56]Do this one.
[348:09.10]I don't do this that often either.
[348:17.35]That trinket's not coming off.
[348:30.81]Okay.
[348:31.15]Okay, I do.
[348:33.09]Go with healing salve.
[348:37.87]Healing salve.
[348:46.22]Uh, I want... No, no, no.
[348:47.14]You shouldn't have that.
[348:47.79]You should have... Don't these stack?
[348:52.13]No.
[348:54.27]You have the cure.
[348:55.13]But no, no.
[348:55.49]You have that anyways.
[348:57.57]I have too much shit.
[349:04.57]I have to throw away some of this stuff.
[349:05.77]I have too much stuff.
[349:22.46]Trinkets.
[349:23.78]Start with the 75% defense.
[349:25.76]Who should I give that to?
[349:29.02]Tank?
[349:30.58]That makes the most sense, but ooh, no, we can't do that.
[349:40.78]Cover the healer, yeah.
[349:45.22]Axe HP on the healer.
[349:48.88]Yeah.
[349:52.48]And then plus 10?
[349:53.72]What is that?
[349:54.18]Already have one of these on.
[350:00.72]Give me a crit.
[350:03.80]10% damage.
[350:05.08]Take the resistance.
[350:07.78]And... I think that's good.
[350:12.25]Nice.
[350:17.39]People who remind Jerma to end the stream are like students who remind the teacher to assign homework.
[350:29.57]Let's go.
[350:32.39]How long have I been streaming for?
[350:34.91]Like five and a half, six hours?
[350:37.85]Six, just about.
[350:42.54]Does it save?
[350:43.08]I don't know.
[350:46.74]This is probably... I don't know if I should start this.
[350:49.32]Resignation.
[350:58.84]So, yeah.
[351:00.38]I don't think I should start this.
[351:08.86]Stop entertaining us.
[351:10.56]Ban that student.
[351:16.86]Six is perfect.
[351:17.78]Six hours is a good place to stop, I think.
[351:21.50]But please confirm with me that if I exit, is it going to abandon the run or am I saved here?
[351:28.72]I hope I'm saved, right?
[351:34.44]It does.
[351:34.78]You're saved.
[351:35.10]Okay.
[351:35.52]Alright, good.
[351:37.80]Cool.
[351:37.90]Alright.
[351:42.51]It's fun.
[351:43.99]I'm starting to understand how interesting it is.
[351:48.13]I prefer the old system, but look, you can't have everything you want.
[351:52.99]It's definitely new.
[351:55.14]It might take a little bit of getting used to, but
[351:58.92]We'll see.
[351:59.92]We'll see what they do.
