[ve:61.1.100]

[00:35.38]How are we doing?
[00:42.26]Welcome to a scary day.
[00:50.01]I told you, I promised you that we were going to do another scary night.
[00:52.45]Said it was going to happen maybe last week.
[00:56.67]Whatever.
[00:58.03]Happening right now.
[01:05.43]Probably going to go to about midnight Pacific.
[01:13.07]Oh boy.
[01:13.57]We'll see.
[01:18.81]I have not only some leftover from last time we did this, but there's some new ones.
[01:24.12]I got a lot more shit.
[01:31.80]Facecam?
[01:32.32]Well, okay, yeah.
[01:33.22]So Facecam will be on tonight, but only during jump scares.
[01:37.34]I have this new streamer technology that when my audio levels get to be a certain DB, it turns on the webcam.
[01:47.89]So if my audio levels hit, I think like 10 to 20 DB, it's fine.
[01:53.73]If it hits like 40, 50, 60 DB, the webcam turns on.
[01:59.89]And it stays on for like 5 to 10 seconds.
[02:07.35]That's way too loud.
[02:08.31]Wait, isn't 60 dB like a jet engine?
[02:16.48]That's too loud.
[02:22.31]That's louder than a jet engine.
[02:25.50]You have to like... We're going to try to catch you picking your nose.
[02:37.93]Yeah, when I pick my nose, it's really loud.
[02:46.93]You didn't even test it?
[02:50.61]This is not real.
[02:51.51]I made it up.
[02:55.76]It will be a cam on today, yes.
[02:57.90]It is Sierra Games.
[03:13.41]You're a pathological liar.
[03:19.14]Um... It's just like talking shit and telling jokes.
[03:24.20]Pathological lying.
[03:26.78]I think like telling jokes is just lying by its very definition.
[03:30.68]You just kind of like fake shit up.
[03:40.89]Concrete booger picker?
[03:42.97]I don't know what that is.
[03:45.01]But you're a concrete weirdo for saying it.
[03:53.23]Oh, Chrono Trigger today?
[03:57.33]Chrono Trigger is not a scary game.
[04:00.27]I will... I have a coffee in my hand.
[04:01.75]I do have to admit something.
[04:04.47]I ran like a lot of errands today.
[04:05.65]I was up really early.
[04:06.99]I did a bunch of shit today before this.
[04:09.43]And I fell asleep.
[04:10.93]And like I fell asleep for like... I want to say like an hour.
[04:13.55]Like two hours ago.
[04:14.35]Like four o'clock, five o'clock.
[04:18.92]And my voice might sound... I got a coffee.
[04:23.75]Coffee past four o'clock.
[04:24.75]I know, I know, I know I shouldn't be doing this.
[04:31.31]Don't worry, we're gonna wake the fuck up real quickly here.
[04:35.31]Don't worry.
[04:35.85]Uh, forget about caffeine.
[04:39.61]Uh, how about Nightmare Files Clap Clap?
[04:47.20]That might wake me up a little.
[04:48.54]You're gonna sleep through the jump scares?
[04:53.82]Yeah, so we got a combination of itch.io stuff.
[04:56.74]There's also some Steam stuff.
[04:57.80]We're not going to get to all these.
[04:58.72]I have like 18 games.
[05:01.68]Some of them are 10 minutes.
[05:02.50]Some of them are an hour.
[05:05.03]I'm just going to pick them out of the box.
[05:06.53]I'm going to pick them out of the bag.
[05:20.88]So, yeah.
[05:22.64]Waiting for the ad break to start.
[05:24.04]Should have started by now.
[05:38.11]I wonder if I can just do it manually from here.
[05:40.49]It does say that running it manually will remove the upcoming auto ad.
[05:44.42]I hope this is accurate.
[05:47.76]Because this should be going by now.
[05:55.87]weird does it say yeah I I gotta you guys can write my setup in your head I don't want to hear it it might be kind of an aggressive title but whatever
[06:24.24]Alright, let me... It says running these manually will remove the upcoming ad.
[06:28.20]We get this.
[06:28.61]This problem happens frequently, but... Let me just... Let's pray that this actually happens.
[06:34.41]Alright, you ready?
[06:39.11]I'm going to run them.
[06:43.83]I will be back to start.
[06:46.41]Hopefully, we don't have to do this twice.
[06:48.97]But you know what?
[06:49.55]This is what it is.
[06:53.62]I will be right back.
[07:00.46]Okay, that was weird.
[07:04.79]Because they're on.
[07:08.03]Now the next one should be...
[07:19.68]Oh, I don't know.
[07:20.42]I don't know.
[07:20.82]Twitch has got this all fucked up.
[07:22.06]Because I just did that and now it just activated.
[07:28.15]Just leave it as is.
[07:29.55]Don't snooze that because it's going to be... Just let it happen.
[07:33.33]This is weird.
[07:34.17]So I just ran a manual three minutes of ads and it said, oh, hey, dude, three minutes of ads are running.
[07:38.38]By the way, in 30 seconds, a three minute ad break is going to start.
[07:44.10]Okay.
[07:45.48]Let's see what happens here.
[07:52.10]I'm very curious what happens here.
[08:00.97]What if it does double ads on the screen?
[08:05.09]Will it do like two at the same time?
[08:06.83]Alright, it says it's coming.
[08:09.68]It says it's going to start right now.
[08:16.10]Okay, I think we're good.
[08:19.57]Hey, can you wish my bestie good luck on her midterms?
[08:22.06]Hey, bestie.
[08:24.24]Good luck on your midterms.
[08:26.94]Okay.
[08:38.99]Are you guys even excited?
[08:40.27]People don't even look excited here.
[08:43.59]Nobody even seems like they're excited tonight.
[08:46.37]Saturday night...
[08:48.74]Might tap into a bush light later.
[08:50.24]We have no idea.
[09:07.27]Coffee and beer.
[09:08.91]I know.
[09:11.03]I haven't had alcohol in more than six months probably.
[09:16.38]I've been sober, sober, sober, sober for months.
[09:21.30]I don't know if it's a good idea.
[09:22.32]We'll see.
[09:27.54]Six hours?
[09:33.95]No, that's not a lie.
[09:34.75]You can't say liar.
[09:40.55]Have an espresso of martini.
[09:42.07]No, I don't think I'd like to shit my pants today.
[09:46.19]Don't know.
[09:49.73]You have a heart attack.
[09:56.43]Everything you say is a lie.
[09:59.50]Hey, will you just relax?
[10:02.32]And will you just relax, sit down and watch clap clap.
[10:05.40]This is the first one.
[10:07.98]Alright, welcome back.
[10:10.82]I think we're good.
[10:12.00]Should be good for an hour.
[10:17.97]Uh, my like ad manager thing is acting very weirdly.
[10:23.11]It does say the next one is scheduled for like an hour from now.
[10:28.31]So.
[10:30.33]OK.
[10:30.57]Alright, you guys ready?
[10:34.95]You guys ready to rate the setup?
[10:38.72]Hey, we're going to get a setup rating in your head.
[10:40.70]Alright, here we go.
[10:51.07]Here's the game.
[10:53.97]But more importantly... What's up?
[11:05.50]It's pretty boring.
[11:10.76]It's pretty... It's pretty boring.
[11:14.28]I got a lava lamp here, though.
[11:15.70]Isn't that cool?
[11:16.87]What the fuck, dude?
[11:18.05]Why is it running ads?
[11:22.09]No, like, honest to fucking God.
[11:23.71]You saw that in real time.
[11:25.45]I don't understand.
[11:34.76]I don't understand.
[11:41.80]Why did that happen?
[11:42.76]No, honestly, why did that happen?
[11:45.04]Honestly.
[11:47.04]All the mods are freaking out.
[11:48.10]Everyone's like, why is it happening?
[11:50.83]This is villain shit right now, I think.
[11:52.43]Yeah, this is villain shit.
[11:53.39]I'm sorry, everybody.
[11:54.73]This is total villain shit, and I don't even... I actually didn't even want this to happen.
[12:01.19]This is villainous, and I apologize.
[12:07.02]I can't turn them off.
[12:09.26]I can't, like, stop them.
[12:15.66]I'm glad we didn't start.
[12:18.13]Is audio lag?
[12:19.41]No, it's not.
[12:24.15]You're going to knock this over?
[12:25.27]I don't think, I hope, I don't, am I going to knock this over?
[12:27.49]There's a mic delay?
[12:31.33]Am I getting one guy?
[12:34.43]Are you hearing me first?
[12:40.90]No, I can, I look, I can, I'm looking over here and I can see in the preview that that's not happening.
[12:48.44]One guy?
[12:50.08]Let's test it.
[12:50.52]Ready?
[12:53.09]One, two, three.
[12:58.48]Yeah, that person's full of shit.
[13:03.06]Anyways, yeah, I took a... I just ran six minutes of ads in the first 10 minutes of the stream.
[13:12.50]That's 60% advertisements per content.
[13:18.26]Fuck.
[13:19.70]This is not good.
[13:22.26]That's not good.
[13:23.84]I'm not happy about this.
[13:27.12]Why are you a redhead?
[13:29.80]It's just the shine, and I'm starting to thin.
[13:32.96]Honestly, I did this to prove to everybody that I'm turning 40 this year, okay?
[13:37.24]And everyone wanted to know.
[13:42.50]You want to see it?
[13:43.26]For real, that's the real one right there.
[13:45.04]I slicked back water.
[13:46.42]I just got out of the shower.
[13:50.68]There it is.
[13:51.84]And top of the head too.
[13:53.92]This is good.
[13:54.92]This is good up here.
[13:57.90]Hey, nobody cares.
[13:59.16]I am just burning time right now because there was six minutes of ads.
[14:04.46]Which is burning time.
[14:10.89]I have to make an apology.
[14:11.93]Hold on.
[14:14.25]Be coming back in one second.
[14:18.03]Hi.
[14:19.69]Welcome back.
[14:20.15]I just want to quickly apologize to those of you that were at that ad break.
[14:24.53]Uh, I'm so sorry.
[14:26.51]That was six minutes of ads during 10 minutes of content.
[14:28.83]Uh, I don't know why that happened, but I do apologize over it.
[14:38.26]Dude, once this thing starts going, it's going to be fucking sick.
[14:45.38]Alright.
[14:45.70]Do you, is it cool looking?
[14:48.25]Just wait.
[14:49.41]No, this is not an elaborate bit.
[14:50.97]I'm not going to knock it over for a joke.
[14:52.47]I actually love this thing.
[14:56.16]You guys ready?
[14:56.68]Are we good?
[15:00.78]Can we actually start now?
[15:03.44]I cannot fucking believe it.
[15:06.10]Why is this leaking?
[15:06.90]Alright, this is called Nightmare Files Clap Clap.
[15:12.91]And it's supposed to be turn your lights off.
[15:15.47]All my lights are off.
[15:16.43]It's the middle of the day.
[15:19.61]I don't know why that happened.
[15:20.77]Money spills out of pockets.
[15:27.86]Wait, we just fucking let's go.
[15:32.90]October of 1984.
[15:34.78]I saw an ad in the newspaper about a house-sitting job.
[15:39.08]Since I was short on cash, I decided to sign up.
[15:41.23]I'm fucked up right now.
[15:42.11]Okay.
[15:46.05]By the way, I got no headphones.
[15:47.11]You noticed I'm going.
[15:48.84]We're going to speakers.
[15:50.12]I want the whole experience.
[15:51.10]I want to find whether.
[15:52.52]Oh, this is crusty.
[15:57.84]Find Maxim's house.
[16:04.23]You've raw dog in the audio.
[16:05.53]I actually prefer it honestly.
[16:08.12]Let me tell you, just complete raw dog in the audio.
[16:10.86]No more, no more shit in your ears.
[16:13.08]Like, oh, I can't wait.
[16:14.77]What?
[16:15.13]Oh, ow.
[16:15.95]Oh, my headset.
[16:17.93]This is, we're going full.
[16:19.19]This is, I hope this starts a revolution here on streamers.
[16:22.45]Hey, you can use speakers.
[16:24.41]Just have your noise gate set and make them far enough away.
[16:27.59]Enjoy yourself.
[16:31.67]Am I just going to this person's trash?
[16:38.22]Excuse me, I'm trying to find a house on this street.
[16:39.80]Could you help me out?
[16:42.92]Sure.
[16:43.18]Which house are you looking for?
[16:45.97]Looking for Maxim's place.
[16:47.59]He hired me to look after it while he's away.
[16:51.49]Maxim, huh?
[16:52.01]That's interesting.
[16:52.49]He usually asks me to watch his place.
[16:59.20]I'm Marco Botofsky, by the way.
[17:00.90]Nice to meet you, Marco.
[17:03.02]Can you tell me where his house is?
[17:05.50]Of course, it's two houses down.
[17:06.68]Mine's right here.
[17:07.48]Our neighbor Savo in the middle.
[17:09.68]And then Maxim's place.
[17:10.80]You can't miss it.
[17:12.72]Okay, so two houses down.
[17:14.10]Appreciate it.
[17:17.70]No problem.
[17:18.02]Now, if you'll excuse me, I just got my home automation system in the mail.
[17:22.01]I'm really excited.
[17:24.09]Oh, that sounds interesting.
[17:24.89]What does it do?
[17:27.45]Well, it's supposed to make life a whole lot easier.
[17:29.07]You know, controlling the lights, temperature, even the security system.
[17:32.71]Pretty cool stuff.
[17:35.59]Now that does sound convenient.
[17:36.59]Why did you decide to get it?
[17:38.13]Why would I be asking this person all these questions?
[17:41.13]I don't know.
[17:43.61]Camera angle is too high.
[17:44.63]You're going to have to fucking live with it.
[17:48.57]Why is it... Hold on.
[17:50.45]I'm asking this guy about his security system?
[17:54.61]Because of the recent disappearances happening around here.
[17:58.25]Mainly because our neighbor Savo got one and won't stop raving about it.
[18:04.49]He left for vacation right after installing it.
[18:06.29]Set it as built-in surveillance systems and all.
[18:09.79]Guess he wanted to keep an eye on things while he's away.
[18:13.33]Well, if you enjoy setting it up, thanks again for the directions.
[18:16.74]No problem.
[18:17.04]If you need anything, I'm just a house away.
[18:18.26]That's a very weird way to get into your mailbox.
[18:29.34]Anything in the trash?
[18:34.83]Is it too loud?
[18:36.03]It's going to be loud, probably.
[18:36.99]Just be aware of that.
[18:37.73]Alright, so next one, not this one.
[18:41.93]What do we got?
[18:44.01]Oh, you have a security system, too.
[18:51.31]Morning.
[18:51.71]ClapClap certified smart house surveillance.
[18:54.33]Alright, this is it.
[19:03.58]So we have to watch the house.
[19:04.70]I think the homeowner mentioned the keys would be in the backyard.
[19:17.07]No, no, it's under a shitty rock right here.
[19:21.15]Don't you know?
[19:23.03]It's just this rock right there and it's under it.
[19:28.59]Backyard?
[19:32.03]It's under a fake rock.
[19:43.75]I think they said they put it in the flower pots.
[19:50.42]They got a little creek in their backyard.
[19:51.96]This is actually kind of nice.
[19:58.08]Alright, there it is.
[19:58.83]Let's see if these work.
[20:03.61]That scribble sound is going to freak me out.
[20:05.15]Alright, unlock the front door.
[20:14.97]Finally, you're showing your face.
[20:18.15]I was on cam like a week ago.
[20:19.79]Okay.
[20:30.62]Okay, it is black in this house.
[20:32.62]It is... I don't think it's this dark in any house.
[20:35.81]No, even in pitch black, I can see.
[20:37.57]Okay, how do I...
[20:52.12]OK, read note on fridge.
[20:55.41]There's too many windows.
[20:56.31]Yeah, I let me let's go over this real quick.
[21:00.64]I am the type of person.
[21:02.50]That likes to walk around my house.
[21:05.98]Maybe not with the most clothes on right?
[21:09.36]I don't like all this.
[21:11.27]If I'm going to buy a place, or if I'm going to live in it, rent a place, and it doesn't matter where it is, all windows need to be at least chest level.
[21:19.11]Chest level and up.
[21:20.37]All of them.
[21:22.23]I don't want windows in any fucking bathrooms.
[21:25.01]I fucking hate that too.
[21:27.91]I don't want... Actually, you know what?
[21:29.23]If I could opt out of it, I would opt out of any windows, period, in the entire house.
[21:34.21]That might make me a weirdo.
[21:36.30]I want, like, the option to open up a window.
[21:39.35]I don't want windows.
[21:41.25]I want the option to have, like, a hole.
[21:42.99]To have, like, oh, okay, there's the window.
[21:46.73]That's crazy.
[21:47.43]I know, but that's an L take.
[21:48.85]You're a vampire.
[21:50.11]No, I just, like, I just... Sometimes you want to walk around, and sometimes I want to watch, like, fucking TV, and I don't want somebody to be like, oh, what's... What's he watching in there?
[21:59.84]Oh, what's this, Severance Season 2?
[22:01.56]Like, I don't... I don't fucking want people to know.
[22:03.51]I don't care.
[22:04.15]Leave me alone.
[22:09.13]Yeah, I know, I know.
[22:11.29]I'm just saying that, like, a lot of times, like, curtains... They, like... Yeah, like, blinds.
[22:19.64]They cover... They collect dust.
[22:23.95]Curtains are cumbersome.
[22:25.13]They're big.
[22:25.67]They're, like... No, I fucking hate it.
[22:29.47]I would love this if I like open I like to open windows it's not that hard I know but I like opening windows when I feel like it but when I don't want them I I want every I want everything sealed I like poke like holes in the top of my house to make sure I don't like suffocate but like you know what I mean I I just I don't love like a shitload of windows
[23:01.26]Hey, thanks for house sitting.
[23:02.54]I'm fucking around everybody.
[23:03.98]It was a joke.
[23:05.91]I like to apologize real quick.
[23:07.71]OK, thanks for the house sitting.
[23:09.33]Please make sure to check the mailbox.
[23:10.61]Water the plants throughout the trash.
[23:12.87]Q toggles the lights on and off in any room.
[23:18.60]Bro, why do you want to live like a hamster?
[23:24.08]I love the sunshine.
[23:25.50]I told you I'm like a lizard.
[23:26.42]I go out there and I sit on a rock and I can sit... I could sit on a rock for like an hour in like a hundred degrees sun.
[23:30.84]I don't even care.
[23:31.30]I love it.
[23:32.66]But I want to watch Severance season one without you fucking knowing anything about it.
[23:45.38]I just...
[23:49.52]You're all, you're pale.

[29:45.48]I wonder what happened.
[29:48.58]And it's at this point that I go like this.
[29:51.90]And I go back to my car.
[29:53.95]And I leave.

[31:45.55]I'm getting that fuck out of here.
[31:46.41]I don't care.
[31:47.35]You don't understand how fast I can get over this fence?
[31:50.72]You understand?
[31:51.50]It doesn't matter how old I am.
[31:52.56]I could be 70.
[31:53.30]It doesn't matter.
[31:54.26]Do you know how fast I could, in real life, go from I hear something to I am over this fence and I am four houses down.
[32:05.90]Gone.
[32:06.90]Gone in a second.
[32:07.80]I'd be gone in a second.
[32:12.72]Alright.
[32:13.00]Crash from the kitchen.
[32:15.79]I'm, like, just... I'm, like, getting my eyes ready to, like, squint.
[32:36.57]Throw out the trash.
[32:39.33]Why is there bones sticking out of this?
[32:49.00]Yeah, why are there bones sticking out of the trash?
[32:56.16]I'm gonna look like a fucking lunatic.
[33:07.75]I was just gone.
[33:08.29]My salt left my body for a second.
[33:19.15]He died.
[33:19.77]Yeah, I died for like a half second.
[33:26.60]You scared the shit out of me.
[33:28.78]I'm Agent Ristolino, Federal Investigation Bureau.
[33:31.96]I need to ask you a few questions.
[33:33.52]What is in there?
[33:34.56]There have been reports of... ...disturbances in this area.
[33:42.83]Disappearances, strange phenomena.
[33:44.79]Conducting an investigation.
[33:47.05]Yeah, I've heard.
[33:47.57]Everything's fine here.
[33:48.33]Just taking out the trash with bones sticking out of it, officer.
[33:52.45]Are you sure?
[33:52.77]We've recently believed that there's more to this neighborhood than meets the eye.
[33:56.57]Yeah, 100%.
[33:57.61]Just taking out the trash, you know.
[33:59.17]I'm the killer.
[34:00.34]It has to be me.
[34:03.42]Keep your eyes and ears open.
[34:04.44]We need to get to the bottom of this.
[34:06.48]Of course, we'll do.
[34:07.16]Thanks, inspector.
[34:07.86]No problem.
[34:09.00]Stay safe out there.
[34:44.79]Why?
[34:46.15]Why is that in the game?
[34:47.71]I didn't mean to do that.
[34:49.04]It's a bag of trash!
[34:55.78]Officer.
[34:56.14]Officer, wake up!
[34:57.28]Officer!
[35:00.77]What the fuck?
[35:01.49]Why is he in a bag?
[35:02.67]Why is he in a bag?
[35:05.33]Um... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:12.94]Oh!
[35:13.58]Okay.
[35:15.00]I know what I need to do.
[35:26.35]I got a guy doing a fucking Blanka ball, and I'm gonna- someone's gonna- you're gonna get Blanka'd.
[35:46.51]I know exactly what I'm doing.
[35:47.67]I can't pick it up anymore.
[36:04.80]Didn't somebody get food first?
[36:15.31]He's gonna... His face is gonna go on the... Alright, just eat some cereal.
[36:21.87]There's no food in the fridge yet.
[36:22.77]Alright, I have to... I have to be strong here.
[36:31.02]Check the rooms upstairs.
[36:58.91]The lights are off already.
[37:00.72]It's an exposure setting on my camera.
[37:02.62]What does this say?
[37:34.06]OK, everything seems good.
[37:35.46]I must be tired.
[37:36.82]I should grab something to eat and go to sleep.
[38:03.64]I am making sure this is available to use whenever I need it.
[38:10.05]There's no food.
[38:15.53]Oh.
[38:16.82]Put cereal on the bed upstairs.
[38:51.71]You can't spell it.
[39:10.59]This is fucked up.
[39:11.67]I want to make sure I have a weapon.
[39:18.52]Lay on the bed.
[39:36.02]No!
[39:36.42]He's gone!
[39:36.88]2.43 a.m.
[39:41.17]Oh!
[39:41.55]Oh god, get up.
[39:45.61]How do I get out of bed?
[40:02.45]Motherfucker.
[40:13.09]Are you gonna knock down every door in the house?
[40:15.31]Why don't you just open it?
[40:17.31]Does this guy not understand that you can just open the door?
[40:18.99]He's just like- BOOM!
[40:21.99]Ah shit!
[40:22.93]BOOM!
[40:23.39]Oops!
[40:34.04]What's it say?
[40:34.44]What's it say?
[40:34.90]What's it say?
[40:35.24]What's it say?
[40:35.58]What's it say?
[40:36.10]What's it say?
[40:36.62]What's it say?
[40:37.28]What's it say?
[40:38.78]How to get spooktubers to play your game.
[41:08.03]I'm just, I'm just loosening up.
[41:09.75]It's like I'm just waiting for like impact at this point.
[41:12.05]I need to like, whew.
[41:32.08]Yeah.
[41:33.04]That's what you do.
[41:33.80]You're just like, I'm good.
[41:44.45]That sounded like... What the fuck?
[41:49.96]That kind of sounded like the tool man.
[42:07.65]Rubber ducky.
[42:08.91]Did I touch it?
[42:29.70]I might have soft-locked myself.
[42:46.39]Ah!
[42:52.97]Ah!
[42:53.41]Ah!
[42:53.85]Ah!
[42:54.13]Ah!
[42:54.53]Ah!
[42:58.01]He's pretty slow.
[42:59.07]He's pretty slow.
[43:07.96]He's so huge.
[43:09.52]He's like having trouble.
[43:10.84]He was trying to chase me, but he's too tall.
[43:12.78]He was like, I'm going to come get this motherfucker.
[43:15.86]Let me go under your doorway.
[43:17.04]Hold on.
[43:18.26]Oh shit, it's like getting in a car.
[43:21.27]You got a chiropractic adjustment.
[43:25.07]He's too tall.
[43:26.05]Okay, I got it.
[43:27.19]I got it.
[43:31.66]Let's do it.
[43:32.36]I got it.
[43:43.64]Okay, let's go.
[43:50.33]Ah!
[43:51.47]He's out the window!
[43:53.15]Ah!
[43:53.51]Ah!
[44:04.09]He's right there.
[44:09.41]Yep.
[44:09.78]Okay.
[44:10.42]Out the window.
[44:10.98]There he is.
[44:11.98]Scary guy.
[44:12.58]Right to the left.
[44:16.14]Boom.
[44:24.15]Okay.
[44:24.97]Alright.
[44:28.41]So I got to go out and then down the stairs.
[44:30.35]I'm ready.
[44:30.69]You ready?
[44:37.38]And here we go.
[44:53.79]Where is he?
[45:01.35]Where is he?
[45:23.84]What?
[45:25.04]It's in the bathroom?
[45:27.60]Oh, I got all the... Oh, he's turning the lights off.
[45:42.56]That's the front door, dude!
[45:43.50]What?
[45:57.25]What the hell was that?
[45:58.23]I need to get as far away from here as possible.
[46:14.35]Is this why you need headphones?
[46:16.07]No, I'm filling my space with fucking audio.
[46:34.97]I think I did it.
[46:37.93]Cool.
[46:41.52]My hair is wet and it's drying and it's giving me like weird, like stringy hair.
[46:47.63]Going in a minute.
[46:49.21]I kept running until I reached the nearest police station while investigating the authorities found Marco's lifeless body in his house.
[46:55.09]Meanwhile, Maxim's remains were found stuffed in the trash bag outside his house.
[46:59.57]Their neighbor Savo has disappeared under similar circumstances.
[47:01.93]His remains have yet to be found.
[47:04.03]Despite the eerie scratches on the walls and my harrowing account, no trace of the creature is ever discovered.
[47:10.11]The case remains unsolved, leaving an unsettling mystery behind.
[47:22.95]Thanks for playing my first ever indie horror game which I enjoyed playing as much as I enjoyed making it.
[47:25.85]Considered wishlisting my next game a sequel to this one.
[47:31.42]Oh shit.
[47:32.06]Was it like Clap Clap 2?
[47:33.10]Lost at sea.
[47:54.03]Stone.
[47:59.97]That was a good one.
[48:01.19]I like that one a lot.
[48:04.11]Wow, moving right along.
[48:08.97]Nightmare files clap clap.
[48:12.78]Very cool.
[48:14.90]Let's see what that was the opener.
[48:18.55]That was really fun?
[48:20.17]I think that was a great one to start with.
[48:21.65]Good shit.
[48:23.47]That was just the right amount of fun and scary and interesting and I loved it.
[48:28.20]I loved it!
[48:30.46]Okay.
[48:32.56]Should we- do you want to tone it down a little?
[48:35.40]Should we tone it down a little?
[48:37.06]Because this next one is not- is like kind of weird?
[48:40.08]But it's not necessarily scary.
[48:42.99]I think it's pretty.
[48:43.75]I think it's pretty short as well.
[48:46.59]Now we want to tone it up.
[48:48.35]Crank it.
[48:50.91]It's like 7 o'clock Pacific.
[48:52.93]The room isn't even dark yet.
[48:53.95]Alright, we'll do.
[49:01.60]This one's called.
[49:03.92]Coffee at night.
[49:13.42]That was, by the way, Nightmare Files.
[49:15.00]You saw the screen.
[49:15.58]It's fine.
[49:17.80]Coffee at night.
[49:19.68]... ...
[49:44.17]I got a coffee right now, so.
[49:49.07]Oh, this game is not designed for children because it contains materials that someone needs.
[49:52.43]Wait, it contains materials that someone needs.
[49:54.36]Wait, what does that say?
[49:55.28]I just, I couldn't, I don't know why I couldn't read that.
[49:57.36]What does that say?
[50:00.26]Use headphones for a better experience or blast out your room with full audio.
[50:15.06]Coffee at night.
[50:15.82]I think we've played, uh, one by a local host before.
[50:19.35]I think this one's very quick.
[50:29.50]I don't want- no, I don't want them to see my pores.
[50:42.95]I want coffee.
[50:44.47]First you need to put a kettle.
[50:45.63]Is this my house?
[50:56.16]Okay.
[51:05.95]Now we need to pour water.
[51:15.41]I need water.
[51:15.83]Where do you get water?
[51:16.47]Fridge?
[51:25.40]I love these.
[51:25.78]These doors are like big and made out of clay.
[51:27.66]I love it.
[51:28.90]In the bathroom?
[51:29.73]No, you don't get it from the toilet, do you?
[51:50.12]Something's gonna like run down the hallway.
[51:51.64]I love these little two room horror games.
[52:04.99]There's something so quaint about them.
[52:08.32]I need a mug.
[52:08.94]Alright, I know what that is.
[52:20.53]Someone's just gonna jump in front of the screen.
[52:21.83]I already know it.
[52:31.29]What kind of sound?
[52:36.77]What kind of sound is that?
[52:37.89]The monster's brushing his teeth.
[52:52.87]Alright, then how you subvert the expectations is something comes out of this door right here on the right.
[53:14.48]What the fuck?
[53:15.88]The clocks?
[53:18.29]What kind of?
[53:21.25]What kind of?
[53:41.76]You gonna be drinking my coffee?
[53:49.71]Do I turn the sink off?
[53:52.97]You left the water on.
[53:53.85]I thought it's like a scary room with a bunch of clocks.
[53:56.29]I don't know.
[53:59.88]Oh.
[54:01.08]It's all strange.
[54:02.32]It is very, this is very strange.
[54:04.98]But you need to cook coffee.
[54:08.95]Sure, I must need coffee.
[54:09.81]You know, I wake up in the morning and I... Sometimes I'm a little slower.
[54:36.51]What was that?
[54:43.00]He got, like, stuck on the lip.
[54:49.04]It remains to wait for the kettle.
[54:50.56]Alright, I have to- It remains- Stop!
[54:57.14]Do I open the door?
[55:03.90]Bro, where do I live?
[55:09.00]Why do I live in, like, the fuckin' Alice in Wonderland?
[55:15.39]Oh my god!
[55:16.71]That was fucking loud!
[55:17.93]Alright, give me my coffee!
[55:23.54]Is the coffee ready?
[55:24.36]I need to put sugar in the coffee?
[55:30.26]Who did this?
[55:34.05]I can pay for this window.
[55:55.16]Okay.
[55:56.96]Okay.
[55:58.66]Now you can work, finally.
[56:30.93]Ending one?
[56:31.85]Why there's endi- Why there's ten endings?
[56:35.87]Obedient Dog is the ending I just got.
[56:42.78]What?
[56:47.60]Thanks for playing.
[56:50.02]What if I just don't do anything?
[56:54.06]Because you follow the instructions.
[56:58.05]Programming, animations, sound effects, music,
[57:01.71]particles interface models what's a part oh particles cool fl studio blender it's a I love this one man show shit I love it should I try to get a different ending alright what if I just don't do anything
[57:30.35]Go explore the maze?
[57:31.81]It looked like I couldn't go outside.
[57:44.03]I want coffee.
[57:44.61]Alright.
[57:44.97]So what if I just say, no, never mind.
[57:46.41]I'm not doing anything.
[57:48.81]Put on a kettle.
[57:49.49]No.
[57:50.97]No.
[57:52.55]I don't think I will.
[57:53.68]I'll just sit here.
[58:12.24]Is this on x2 speed?
[58:15.66]No.
[58:16.92]What if I just stare at the front door?
[58:20.04]Go back to bed.
[58:20.64]Put a loud noise flashing light warning in the title?
[58:27.13]Probably not a bad idea in general.
[58:28.73]I feel like half of these are gonna- there's gonna be, like, just loud flashing lights in every other game.
[58:33.51]Yeah, maybe just, like, at the end of the title, like, warning.
[58:38.98]Flashing lights, maybe.
[58:42.79]Loud lights.
[58:50.74]It says scary games.
[58:56.34]Alright, so I'm not going to do.
[58:57.38]I should just sit here.
[59:06.14]Is that lava lamp edited in?
[59:10.64]No, bro.
[59:11.06]This thing is just going.
[59:12.52]Look at it.
[59:18.08]Turn off your lights.
[59:19.49]My lights are off.
[59:22.19]It's just not nighttime here yet.
[59:27.03]Just wait till it gets a little actually dark.
[59:31.07]Another like 20-30 minutes.
[59:36.39]Okay.
[59:37.55]Nothing's happened yet.
[59:43.15]Dude, where the fuck are you?
[59:45.91]Close the blinds.
[59:46.35]My blinds are closed!
[59:47.65]There's no lights on!
[59:49.39]Why do you have a dildo on your desk?
[59:55.76]Time that person up for 20 minutes.
[59:58.84]It's a lava lamp, you fucking... dork.
[60:08.79]I'm gonna try to run outside if I can.
[60:11.57]Pour the water.
[60:19.55]Alright, I can't open it.
[60:23.11]You look scary today.
[60:28.62]That's fine.
[60:32.86]Okay, I got it.
[60:35.42]You read that from AutoMod.
[60:37.98]Yeah, you're right, I did.
[60:38.98]Alright, need a mug.
[60:47.21]How many endings are there?
[60:48.35]I'm very curious about this.
[60:54.63]Alright, it's going to be loud sound here in a second.
[60:56.23]Be ready.
[60:56.87]What kind of sound?
[61:01.59]Nice LARPing swords, nerd.
[61:17.76]Oh.
[61:19.46]Those.
[61:21.52]Oh.
[61:24.40]You mean those?
[61:24.96]Alright, here comes loud knocking and then loud glass breaking.
[61:45.56]Oh, it was somebody... Okay, now that's a lot scarier now because that's somebody that was hanging.
[61:58.83]Here comes blast shatter.
[62:00.37]I can't leave.
[62:05.55]I can't get out this door.
[62:06.29]I don't want to listen to that.
[62:11.09]Are there any other endings?
[62:20.44]How can I not be?
[62:24.66]I can't leave.
[62:42.36]Music's chill.
[62:43.08]Music is good, yeah.
[62:52.52]I'm just seeing if I can go out any other doors or anything.
[62:55.64]I can't walk out the door.
[62:56.72]So, pour the coffee.
[63:00.72]Okay, drink the coffee.
[63:02.65]Now I can work.
[63:12.44]Oh, I got, I got another ending.
[63:18.48]Evening with coffee.
[63:20.65]Let's go.
[63:21.15]I got the evening with, I got to just enjoy my evening.
[63:29.41]You promised you'd show us the sword collection.
[63:31.43]Yeah, I just tell you it'd be fun.
[64:19.59]Were you talking about this?
[65:06.75]That's one foot long.
[65:07.87]That thing is fucking huge, by the way.
[65:09.55]You're full of shit.
[65:12.31]That thing weighs like 14 pounds.
[65:14.73]That's a toothpick?
[65:25.80]That's a two-handed broadsword and a rapier.
[65:31.86]And yes, I have smashed a watermelon with it.
[65:39.06]At your desk.
[65:43.99]Oh no.
[65:49.17]It's starting to get dark.
[65:51.76]Alright.
[65:54.32]We're gonna start to get some light.
[65:56.04]I got ad breaks coming up here in a minute.
[66:00.44]Why does your camera quality look like found footage?
[66:04.17]I did it deliberately to make you angry.
[66:12.65]Is it 60 FPS?
[66:13.23]Yeah, it is.
[66:17.16]Actually, hold on.
[66:17.76]Let's try this.
[66:20.56]You want it to be darker?
[66:21.90]What's that?
[66:26.21]That looks fucking awful.
[66:46.37]It looks like I'm in an 80s movie.
[66:48.75]It looks like an 80s movie.
[66:51.54]Where are my eyebrows?
[66:52.46]Nice 240p.
[66:54.30]I can't handle that.
[67:01.24]I need to turn this back on.
[67:33.44]I'll fix it.
[67:35.20]Okay, we got a break coming up.
[67:36.65]I'll make it nice and spooky on the break.
[67:41.87]Just give me a minute.
[67:43.77]I'll make it spooky.
[67:47.38]Uh, that was coffee at night.
[67:50.90]Now it looks like my camera's irradiated.
[68:02.47]Okay, whatever.
[68:04.13]I'll be back.
[68:04.61]Ads are gonna play.
[68:05.59]See you guys in three, four minutes.
[68:11.70]How do I leave?
[68:12.18]Oh, okay.
[68:16.80]Alright, give me a second.
[68:21.46]BRB.
[68:25.55]Let's pretend I'm on BRB.
[68:43.76]Hey.
[68:45.10]Look at that.
[68:46.74]I told you I was gonna fix it.
[68:49.46]I told you I was gonna fix it.
[68:55.03]How's that look?
[68:56.45]Looks better.
[68:58.91]No longer- no longer, uh, radiation in the room.
[69:07.24]Look!
[69:08.84]It's going!
[69:15.21]Are you even paying attention?
[69:16.07]Alright, BRB.
[72:53.33]Welcome back.
[72:55.87]Alright.
[72:57.59]Now... How are we doing?
[73:07.88]We good?
[73:13.28]Didn't mean to do that.
[73:16.98]Alright, the next one... What are we doing next?
[73:25.05]Alright, I want to do... This one's called The Other One.
[73:31.62]The Other One.
[73:40.82]Are you filming this on a 3DS?
[73:44.08]No, it's just the aesthetic, man.
[73:47.82]Turn it up a little.
[73:50.10]I'm going to be turning these up, but be careful because there could be loud ass sounds.
[74:04.65]Alright, do we want no pixelation?
[74:10.34]Let's keep it on default, it's fine.
[74:13.98]What do I have for dinner?
[74:17.40]I had a hot dog.
[74:18.16]That was a while ago though.
[74:24.63]Alright, let's go.
[74:26.19]I'm fucking ready.
[74:50.52]WSD shift.
[74:52.55]Look around.
[74:53.15]How's that sensitivity?
[74:54.93]A little bit higher.
[74:56.23]How's that?
[75:01.46]Feels pretty good.
[75:06.44]OK, this is called the other one.
[75:21.62]Why am I in here?
[75:24.46]What the hell am I doing in here?
[75:28.10]I just crawled into this abandoned place and just... Alright, somebody please hit me in the back of the head with a wrench.
[75:36.06]Feels like I've been knocked out.
[75:37.06]It was a bad idea to explore this house.
[75:40.07]I need to get out of here.
[75:41.01]Okay, E.
[75:51.17]Click and E is your hand.
[76:01.52]Picture of a woman.
[76:11.01]Oh, it's rain.
[76:12.19]Cool.
[76:15.57]OK, you think as little like kind of independent game developer tactics,
[76:20.57]rain... falling.
[76:24.42]It's actually just a little... like some light that's just kind of going like this.
[76:33.18]Stuck.
[76:33.44]I can't open.
[76:34.44]Even if I could, there are bars outside.
[76:36.46]What even is this place?
[76:38.02]That's cool.
[76:38.58]I like that.
[76:41.40]That's so cool.
[76:44.95]A wardrobe is locked.
[76:45.81]Who locks a wardrobe with a padlock?
[76:49.96]Alright.
[76:51.36]Shit, it's locked.
[76:58.36]What?
[76:58.52]This wasn't here.
[77:00.12]An old camera and a tape.
[77:02.42]The tape is signed, Your Way.
[77:05.66]What is it all about?
[77:06.18]There's no one here.
[77:07.24]Someone's playing with me?
[77:08.90]Well, it won't hurt to check it out, right?
[77:10.16]Maybe some saw shit on there.
[77:31.29]It's gonna be somebody's, like, acting reel.
[77:37.27]What the fuck is going on?
[77:40.07]Wait, I'm walking around in the camera.
[77:57.40]Wait, I'm watching...
[78:01.14]I am watching right now what happened to the last person, but it's me controlling it.
[78:10.02]What the heck?
[78:16.29]That's sick.
[78:22.73]Alright, I got the key.
[78:31.33]Even the audio is kind of low, too.
[78:45.10]I'm looking at that door in real life over there.
[78:52.22]By the way, this is how I make every single staircase in Minecraft.
[78:56.36]This is giving me flashbacks.
[78:57.48]This is flashbacks.
[79:00.11]Every time I do anything, this is how it looks.
[79:02.51]If I need to go down.
[79:03.21]Okay.
[79:41.36]Like a nucleus.
[79:45.76]Camera?
[79:50.50]What do I do?
[79:55.73]Oh, shit.
[80:00.79]What?
[80:01.03]Who put that here?
[80:01.83]Am I losing my mind?
[80:02.89]It's another one?
[80:04.91]I don't like it.
[80:05.39]I'm gonna need this flashlight, though.
[80:06.65]Better take it.
[80:16.37]No reason carrying this around.
[80:17.39]I'll leave this on the table.
[80:18.57]Okay.
[80:22.19]That box made of sturdy metal locked.
[80:23.69]Red key.
[80:28.53]It's gonna be loud, isn't it?
[80:31.49]Cassette player.
[80:32.05]There's no tape.
[80:34.23]Picture of a man.
[80:37.41]The tape is signed outside the insides.
[80:40.01]It feels weird to watch them.
[80:41.61]It's like I wasn't just watching, but actually being there physically.
[80:46.42]Are we gonna listen to a tape now?
[80:51.46]Should I put this in there?
[80:56.97]Okay, new tape.
[81:20.48]Is rust the scariest thing in the world?
[81:32.04]I feel like all horror dies down to rusty sound effects.
[81:38.29]If we didn't have, like... I don't think anything would be scary.
[81:55.11]part of inside of something.
[81:59.53]By the way, that was a Minecraft sound.
[82:02.13]Just so we're really clear.
[82:20.54]This is weird, though.
[82:21.32]Okay.
[82:28.09]Can I activate it?
[82:33.68]Should I go down deeper?
[82:34.52]Is that growing or am I crazy?
[82:45.16]How do I turn this on?
[82:47.03]Oh, there you go.
[82:53.39]I gotta be fast, I think.
[82:55.89]Oh.
[83:04.24]Something's going to burst through that door and scream at me.
[83:07.60]You know it's how they're going to end it.
[83:10.46]And I know it's happening.
[83:12.20]Look at the placement of that door.
[83:14.92]It just is.
[83:16.10]And I hate that that's going to happen, but it is.
[83:22.06]Ugh.
[83:26.42]This camera's got a good battery, though.
[83:51.56]What the?
[83:53.08]What do I do?
[84:18.35]Do I have to pop another one of those?
[84:26.94]Yep.
[84:30.26]Somebody's in the room!
[84:30.88]Somebody's in the room!
[84:31.52]Put the camera down!
[84:32.02]Put the camera down!
[84:32.46]Somebody's in the room!
[84:34.10]Somebody's in the room!
[84:34.98]Put the camera down!
[84:36.14]Somebody is in the room to the left.
[84:37.54]Put the camera down.
[84:42.29]He jumped out of the screen!
[84:43.49]He escaped!
[84:44.19]He escaped into the real world!
[84:53.75]Get off of TikTok and pay attention to your fucking surroundings.
[85:08.90]I knew it.
[85:09.40]I fucking told you.
[85:10.40]He was right there.
[85:11.30]I knew it.
[85:12.22]I was so ready for it.
[85:19.66]He, like, out of the screen.
[85:23.12]He just jumped out.
[85:25.98]How is this happening?
[85:26.59]Whenever I see certain things on the footage, they appear on the table.
[85:40.54]I don't like this one.
[85:42.58]A crowbar?
[85:49.92]That's gonna happen like three more times.
[85:52.48]I don't want to do it.
[85:53.28]Okay, that was kind of funny.
[86:10.54]Alright, that wasn't even a scary monster.
[86:14.30]This is another guy's apartment.
[86:21.53]Somebody else just lives over here.
[86:23.11]And we kind of just... Okay.
[86:29.20]Okay, what does this one say?
[86:30.90]The gate.
[86:32.98]I know your old roommate used to slide Skittles under the door here for you, but I'm a different tenant.
[86:43.05]By the way, seal this up.
[86:58.12]Never reach through the apartment hole.
[87:00.08]Oh no, I've been sucked in.
[87:01.20]How do I even get here?
[87:02.14]What?
[87:02.28]I got sucked into the game.
[87:11.30]Jesus Christ!
[87:15.13]He's kind of fast, actually.
[87:24.03]Oh!
[87:24.15]He's fucking... Why did I turn around?
[87:26.37]What's wrong with me?
[87:48.90]I hope this is the exit.
[87:49.72]Hurry!
[88:06.11]Did he get me?
[88:06.63]I woke up being all alone and the door was open just like that.
[88:09.95]I still can't believe I managed to exit the house.
[88:14.94]Nothing and no one stopped me.
[88:19.37]Trauma of those events haunt me to this day.
[88:24.93]My friends didn't see the change in me at first, but you can't hide with your true emotions forever.
[88:31.31]I can't tell them.
[88:31.89]They won't believe me anyway.
[88:32.95]This is my burden, and I have to carry it myself.
[88:42.86]There's no way I'm going back in there.
[88:44.30]Okay, well, we're not going back in there.
[88:47.58]I'm going to get grabbed.
[89:04.43]Fuck that.
[89:09.51]I'm still afraid that I'll see this thing.
[89:11.81]Although in my head it's still present haunting me every time I hear a sudden noise or have a bad dream.
[89:19.20]I think this feeling will eventually go away as well as my phobia of cameras.
[89:24.41]This dude is not doing alright now.
[89:26.89]I mean, it will, right?
[89:27.89]This is about time to take a sip of coffee.
[89:32.63]I like that one.
[89:42.66]That one was cool.
[89:45.80]I like the kind of the real life.
[89:51.27]It's like things jumped out and out of the camera.
[89:54.55]There's a secret goofy ending for this game.
[89:58.29]Go into the trees?
[90:10.80]Let's do the goofy ending.
[90:14.74]Oh, it just exited the game.
[90:21.52]I like hummingbirds, and I have Bing wallpaper, okay?
[90:26.49]I don't even know how it got on my computer.
[90:29.25]But I've been using it.
[90:35.50]I want to see the Goofy ending.
[90:46.96]Nobody criticized your wallpaper, dude.
[90:48.68]No, and no, they wouldn't.
[90:50.02]Why would they?
[90:50.72]It's fucking based.
[90:56.26]OK, so if I go to the.
[91:03.47]OK.
[91:07.89]So do not go in the house.
[91:09.83]This apparently I can go around and go look in the trees and there's a funny ending.
[91:17.80]This is the funny ending.
[91:23.83]Someone left a toy here.
[91:24.85]Why does it smell like poop and garlic?
[91:58.03]And then they can look in the trees?
[92:02.68]Took me a long time to reach this abandoned place.
[92:04.26]I hope it'll be worth it.
[92:05.02]I don't think I can do it.
[92:18.02]No point in standing here getting wet.
[92:19.18]Better go inside.
[92:19.82]Dude!
[92:40.01]Am I gonna be killed by the poop garlic guy?
[92:42.13]I think it might have to happen at the end.
[93:09.82]Okay, there's apparently like a tree right here?
[93:12.57]Oh, I'm going to have to replay the game.
[93:22.53]Oh, sorry.
[93:24.21]It's at the end of the game.
[93:25.47]Ah, it's alright, it's alright.
[93:27.65]Alright, well the poop garlic guy kind of comes after you, I think.
[93:32.02]Alright, coming up next.
[93:32.80]That was a good one.
[93:33.62]I liked that one a lot.
[93:36.15]Uh, we got... I want you to... This game's called Creature Packets.
[93:40.11]I want to check it out.
[93:41.50]This might not be scary, but it might be cool.
[93:44.84]Let's find out.
[93:46.02]Creature Packets.
[93:52.28]Creature Packets.
[94:04.92]Hi, my name... doesn't matter.
[94:09.12]I'm your boss and I will be responsible for you.
[94:10.88]Your job is to fulfill orders by cooking different tiny creatures.
[94:16.87]I hope you can figure out the equipment.
[94:21.37]It's all pretty simple.
[94:24.07]Please don't litter.
[94:24.85]There's a trash bin here for that.
[94:28.82]Well, good luck to you and we'll move on to your first order.

[97:12.85]Oh, shit.
[97:14.89]Okay, an aphid is a worm.
[97:17.84]And what is that?
[97:18.82]Like a shrimp?

[98:47.99]Whoa!
[98:58.17]And go.
[99:00.08]Great.
[99:00.34]Also, please note that when a new terrarium is delivered, extra creatures will appear there.
[99:05.86]If they are not in the order, just crush them.
[99:08.13]And we move on to the next order.
[99:09.83]Oh, I don't want to crush them.
[99:13.96]Look at them, they're so funny.
[99:14.92]Alright, aphid, caterpillar, snail.
[99:33.25]Okay.
[99:34.69]Aphid is already in there.
[99:35.67]How do you make a caterpillar?
[99:38.70]Saw that earlier.

[113:36.62]Alright, get ready for the jumpscare.
[113:51.73]The working day is over so you can go out the door.
[114:07.54]After the day's work was done, you decided not to return to that strange job.
[114:10.25]It was hard for you to look at the creatures passing by on the street.
[114:13.35]You saw them as a food packet that needed to be heated in the microwave.
[114:23.75]Oh, okay.
[114:25.03]We did... I feel great.
[114:27.05]We didn't even get scared.
[114:27.97]It was just like opening packets.
[114:30.35]Created in three days.
[114:34.16]The theme was tiny creatures.
[114:36.81]That's fucking pretty good.
[114:38.19]Three days?
[114:42.77]I couldn't make something like this in three months.
[114:44.79]Three days.
[114:45.51]Damn.
[114:47.11]Okay.
[114:49.09]That was cute.
[114:49.51]I like that one.
[114:52.49]That was what I was thinking was going to be not like crazy scary, but that's really cool.
[114:56.99]Great fucking job.
[115:01.04]Alright, we're going up on, this one's called the hidden layer.
[115:06.40]The hidden layer.
[115:09.04]How are we doing on break?
[115:10.34]Got about 13 minutes.
[115:11.48]Alright.
[115:24.56]It's on a different screen.
[115:33.69]OK via settings Andy for a second.
[115:42.95]Hidden layer like an onion layer.
[115:49.87]Turn it down just a little.
[115:54.27]How's that good?
[116:01.39]Why did you change the room back?
[116:03.93]Um, I don't know.
[116:04.93]It just felt like it was time.
[116:11.70]It felt like it was time.
[116:16.62]My name is Alex.
[116:17.42]I'm a full-time chemistry and biology student at Stanford University.
[116:22.51]This story happened to me 10 years ago.
[116:23.87]My parents went to Haiti on vacation.
[116:25.43]I need to look after somebody.
[116:43.38]I love that I have a crosshair up here.
[116:45.00]I love that I'm also not turning the wheel.
[117:13.22]It was so quiet you just heard the frog just come out of my stomach.
[117:21.65]Alright, I made it.
[117:22.17]I just... That's how you drive a car in a dream.
[117:38.76]Okay.
[117:41.00]I finally arrived.
[117:43.29]I'm so tired.
[117:45.05]600 miles.
[117:45.81]Road was hard.
[117:46.85]600 miles?
[117:49.79]I think granddad didn't heard that I arrived.
[117:52.33]Need to meet him.
[117:55.85]600 miles.
[117:56.43]Meet grandfather.
[117:59.48]Turn this up a little.
[118:03.44]It's a little quiet, right?
[118:08.36]That's better.
[118:14.92]Still quiet?
[118:15.42]I'm gonna regret this.
[118:20.92]But, I'm turning it up a little bit more.
[118:24.70]Man, this is a weird FOV!
[118:27.92]Oh, there's Grandfather.
[118:34.33]Hi, Alex!
[118:36.43]Finally, you came!
[118:37.33]Hi, Granddad.
[118:38.85]Yep, road was so long.
[118:41.71]Parents went to Haiti, so we got a lot of time to spend together.
[118:45.60]Yes, I can just remember my childhood and at the same time help you with your affairs.
[118:49.79]Have a good night!
[118:52.05]What are you watching?
[119:16.33]He's watching scary shit.
[119:30.51]Just was saying, just testing.
[119:39.69]Is this the room?
[119:40.71]No.
[119:45.68]Man, this is so weird.
[119:46.92]It feels like... I feel like I'm in a dream.
[119:51.85]The FOV is very odd.
[119:56.11]This is my room.
[119:58.03]Every summer I came here, I like to pack... I like back to past.
[120:02.45]All things are on the same places.
[120:04.99]I need to go to bed.
[120:05.63]Okay.
[120:08.33]Go to bed.
[120:11.17]Dude, a switch...
[120:17.36]A Steam Deck?
[120:20.54]I need to turn off light before go to sleep.
[120:27.54]He's gonna be, like, in my face or something, isn't he?
[120:29.66]322 AM.
[120:48.79]Alright.
[120:49.23]Ah, what is that sound was?
[120:56.82]I hope everything is fine with Grandad.
[120:59.46]Let's check him.
[121:05.24]Where's the light?
[121:05.78]I can't... Where's the light?
[121:06.91]I can't see anything.
[121:13.65]Grandad?
[121:15.99]Turn every light on.
[121:30.14]He's not down here.
[121:33.08]Wait, different bedroom?
[121:38.14]Find grandfather.
[121:47.23]These, dude, why you don't do it so violently?
[122:04.87]I should probably turn it down.
[122:05.69]It's gonna be... It's gonna be loud.
[122:07.70]It's gonna be loud.
[122:08.30]It's gonna be loud.
[122:10.14]It's gonna be loud.
[122:14.84]Where is my granddad?
[122:16.16]He's not at his room.
[122:17.72]Let's continue.
[122:18.50]Alright.
[122:22.82]I love that he's addressing us.
[122:27.85]He's addressing us.
[122:35.00]What does Grandad's room look like?
[122:40.07]Dude, Grandad has a huge ass bed.
[122:50.39]Damn!
[122:55.62]Grandad, you got the big, big TV in the bedroom and the big TV in the living room?
[123:01.98]Damn, okay.
[123:02.88]Inspect the house.
[123:07.38]I really hope that, like, Grandad ain't gonna come out here.
[123:09.66]With, like, a fucking axe or something.
[123:18.65]Grandad, do you have an automatic toothpaste dispenser?
[123:21.05]Soap thing?
[123:21.55]Whatever it is, I just read it.
[123:32.41]The garage?
[123:38.34]Are you going to be outside?
[123:39.62]I am huge.
[123:41.60]These trees are small, or I'm big.
[123:46.31]I mean, the doors upstairs were locked.
[123:47.55]Maybe they're not locked now.
[123:50.83]Oh, you motherfucker!
[123:52.55]Don't do that!
[123:55.68]Grandad, you scared me.
[123:56.80]What was the noise a minute ago?
[123:59.85]Ah, Alex, just go to bed.
[124:01.17]I just needed to take care of some tools and workshop.
[124:04.98]Great, but why at night?
[124:07.00]I can't sleep.
[124:07.68]Just found another deal for me.
[124:11.24]I will go to bed.
[124:24.07]Alright.
[124:40.79]I'm... I'm gonna go to bed.
[124:42.49]6.15 a.m.
[124:55.87]Alright, now it's the morning.
[124:57.17]Should be good.
[125:05.02]I want a drink.
[125:06.64]The story with Grandad tool-sorting at night make me mad.
[125:16.80]Grandma always loved all these old pictures.
[125:18.48]She's been gone for seven years, but the pictures at home remind me of her.
[125:24.59]What the fuck is going on?
[125:31.39]Huh?
[125:40.71]So I'm obviously having a dream about all the granddads.
[125:45.67]I can, like, pick them up.
[125:57.27]Okay.
[126:13.78]What the fuck, Grandad?
[126:21.60]11, 12 a.m.
[126:22.24]I thought we were gonna get credits.
[126:24.61]I thought we were just gonna get credits.
[126:27.31]That would have been fucking perfect credits right there.
[126:31.05]What a crazy night.
[126:32.11]It was a wild dream.
[126:33.09]Anyway, I need to go to the toilet and make breakfast.
[126:43.82]It's already 11.
[126:44.68]Oh, I gotta go to the toilet.
[126:46.55]I gotta make breakfast with the, you know.
[126:48.93]I gotta make food.
[126:49.73]Oh, I don't know why that just doesn't... Okay, go to the toilet.
[126:57.03]I get it.
[126:58.15]I know.
[126:58.56]It's the sentence just said that way.
[127:00.68]I know.
[127:03.84]That's a very normal thing to say.
[127:06.08]I get it.
[127:10.58]Alright, I got a break coming up here.
[127:12.55]I'm gonna take it.
[127:15.74]We'll find out what happens to Grandad when I come back.
[127:19.22]And you know what?
[127:19.72]It's time for a bush light?
[127:26.92]What do you think?
[127:34.53]Is it 8 o'clock?
[127:41.52]Crack a cold one?
[127:47.30]I might.
[127:47.78]I'm considering.
[127:48.70]I'm considering it.
[127:49.30]I'll be right back.
[127:57.47]See you guys in a few minutes.
[128:00.57]You should shave your head.
[128:01.49]That's not going to happen.
[132:05.07]I'm back.
[132:05.63]Do I see people crit- somebody criticizing my setup?
[132:17.88]I see a setup criticism.
[132:24.03]It's like 8% of the screen.
[132:28.55]Oh, you don't- you don't like the wide fucking- you don't like the wide cam?
[132:33.27]I feel like when I go like, whoa!
[132:40.19]I like having a lava lamp right there.
[132:45.05]I could crop it a little bit, but I like having a nice wide angle.
[132:48.98]Oh, by the way.
[132:54.10]Let's crack open a bush light.
[132:59.38]There are people fishing.
[133:00.40]Okay, there are people fishing on this.
[133:05.71]I haven't had- I have not had a- I have not had a beer like this in 20 fucking years, probably.
[133:11.02]15 years at least.
[133:12.64]Since I was like, like 22.
[133:13.88]Hey, look.
[133:18.46]Ooh.
[133:19.58]Ooh, that snapped.
[133:20.88]You hear that snap?
[133:24.83]Alright, I'm gonna give you the real review.
[133:27.43]Here's the re- I got dead pixels?
[133:28.95]Where?
[133:34.75]I'm gonna give you the review.
[133:42.71]Oh, that is stanky.
[133:52.35]It's a lot.
[133:52.77]Actually, you know, it's a little deeper than I thought it was going to be.
[133:54.69]This is light beer.
[133:59.55]But there's some boldness to it.
[134:05.83]I have a dead pixel.
[134:20.71]Hey!
[134:29.78]How did you even notice this?
[134:38.92]What the fuck?
[134:39.82]This camera's brand new before I threw it in the closet and fucking probably stepped on it a few times.
[134:49.39]It's been in the closet for like probably a year and a half.
[134:52.21]And I probably stepped on it.
[134:53.13]Whatever, you can't even notice it.
[134:55.91]Shit, you can notice it.
[134:57.46]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[134:59.10]Hey.
[135:01.64]Let's have a little bit of a bush light.
[135:07.36]I actually don't hate it.
[135:09.66]I actually really don't hate it.
[135:13.07]It's a little... It's got a little stank on it, but I actually like it.
[135:22.52]Okay, the only way that I can drink beer is if it is ice cold.
[135:27.99]It has to be to a point where it hurts.
[135:32.57]You just shotgun one for the boys?
[135:38.27]I'm celebrating my 40th birthday this year.
[135:40.70]We do not shotgun a beer for the boys anymore.
[135:43.94]We sip it on the couch.
[135:49.46]Sorry.
[135:52.03]Yeah, sorry, guys, I-I-I s- we sip a bush light on the couch while we finish our taxes.
[135:57.08]Okay?
[136:01.26]Alright, let's go- we're gonna go to the toilet and I'm not even gonna say it because it's gonna get clipped, but you know what's gonna happen.
[136:14.05]That's loud.
[136:25.03]What a responsible adult.
[136:33.76]I need to close the door before pee.
[136:35.84]What do you mean?
[136:36.34]Wait, uh, why am I- why is there a pee mechanic?
[136:42.06]I was gonna say, it's not gonna be like a yellow stru-
[136:52.96]Dude, you're doing this all wrong.
[136:54.70]No, no, fuck you if you do it like this.
[136:56.86]You're doing it all wrong.
[136:57.92]I'm sorry.
[136:59.12]You don't pee directly into the center water mass.
[137:02.45]You don't do that.
[137:03.87]You pee, like, right here.
[137:06.07]Get the downward momentum so it trickles down into the bowl.
[137:09.21]Pissing like this is crazy person behavior, I think.
[137:13.52]Just going right down center.
[137:15.70]Right center mass.
[137:21.47]No, you pee as if you're going to wake up the whole house if you pee into the... Oh, you're going to mango... What is it?
[137:28.73]A mango cart?
[137:30.72]Oh, damn.
[137:36.16]That sounds fucking pretty good.
[137:43.59]Pee tips at God's hour of 1130.
[137:49.63]I'm looking over at my mod chat.
[137:51.89]Everyone's got their own bush light.
[137:58.98]Okay, hold on and listen up.
[138:01.56]There was an ad stream yesterday.
[138:04.06]There's going to be a sponsored stream tomorrow.
[138:06.94]Do not twist this up.
[138:09.62]This looks like it, but I'm just drinking this.
[138:13.84]It's not like ad weekend.
[138:15.45]We got some spot in the middle here.
[138:18.12]And I, yeah, I am facing the label to the camera, but that's just the way it is.
[138:26.66]I don't, I actually like it.
[138:35.88]I need to make breakfast.
[138:39.87]Granddad loves toast with jam.
[138:44.29]Let's see.
[138:49.40]This fridge is a fucking disaster, by the way.
[139:01.33]Drinks on the bottom?
[139:02.89]No, drinks go in the door.
[139:06.62]Oh, one of my mods said, hey, cheers.
[139:09.48]Pedialyte.
[139:22.27]Pedialyte's good shit when you're not feeling well.
[139:26.75]Okay, put toast.
[139:28.03]Are we both going to eat this?
[139:31.33]Where's the jam?
[139:41.93]Uh, Grandad, where do you keep the jam?
[139:51.44]How do I pick it up?
[139:57.39]Grandad, you scared me.
[139:59.59]Good morning!
[140:00.20]Great to see that you're doing breakfast for your old man.
[140:03.60]Okay, let's eat.
[140:04.30]Let me put jam on your bread.
[140:09.74]Bookie's making that sound.
[140:12.47]Here, let me just... sneak... let me sneak behind you for a sec.
[140:16.35]There you go, okay.
[140:21.37]Happy fucking birthday!
[140:27.85]Was it good?
[140:28.21]It's nothing.
[140:30.93]It's just weird stuff.
[140:51.33]Strange things.
[140:52.15]It's horrible.
[140:52.99]Sometimes I remember something, too, but I can't figure out what it is.
[140:56.79]And you didn't tell me about it.
[140:59.43]No, Grandfather, I didn't say.
[141:01.38]I just didn't want to bother you.
[141:03.64]Bother?
[141:04.30]Oh, yeah, I shouldn't have.
[141:05.64]You know, I kind of forgot that you live with us.
[141:08.28]You live here, don't you?
[141:10.56]Yes, Grandfather, I'm here.
[141:11.80]I'm always there for you.
[141:13.23]You'd better tell me how to help you.
[141:15.81]Don't worry about the old man.
[141:17.37]But it's hard for me to carry the trash.
[141:19.68]It's piled up in the storage room.
[141:21.06]I just can't do it, Alex.
[141:23.38]Don't worry, Grandpa.
[141:24.68]I'll help you.
[141:26.72]Thank you, grandson.
[141:27.50]You've always been there for me when things are tough.
[141:30.71]Where's my old shoe?
[141:32.41]I remember it was here.
[141:33.39]Or was it?
[141:33.81]It's okay, Grandpa.
[141:35.41]We'll find it.
[141:36.35]Let's do the trash first.
[141:38.21]Yeah, the trash.
[141:38.97]It's important, right?
[141:43.54]Throw trash.
[141:59.45]Where's the trash?
[142:14.41]Where is it?
[142:16.94]I can't believe I put that guy in a trash bag in the very beginning of the stream.
[142:19.62]That was fucking crazy.
[142:22.22]That was crazy.
[142:24.74]Throw trash.
[142:25.38]Where is it?
[142:31.28]You already forgot?
[142:32.20]Upstairs in storage room?
[142:33.84]Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[142:35.32]I'm sorry.
[142:35.84]I'm busy trying to talk.
[142:37.40]I wonder what Grandpa keeps in this box.
[142:49.52]It's going to be a head.
[142:50.14]Okay, well, how do I get it?
[143:05.52]I can't get it.
[143:09.38]Oh, okay.
[143:14.06]Have to crouch.
[143:25.63]What is your beer of choice when you go fishing?
[143:43.42]That's just... That was just odd.
[143:46.26]I'm not necessarily scared by this.
[143:47.94]It was just a little odd.
[143:50.98]Grandpa, what are you doing there?
[143:52.69]Have you lost something?
[143:53.65]I was planning to go somewhere.
[143:56.29]Wasn't I planning to?
[143:57.25]I don't remember how I ended up here.
[144:05.45]This is just a little odd.
[144:09.63]You seem like the kind of guy to carry... Wait, what did you say?
[144:13.13]You seem like the kind of guy to carry all the chairs at church to show off to women.
[144:18.34]I don't even know what that even means.
[144:24.40]Carry all the chairs at church?
[144:29.44]I don't... I don't get it.
[144:30.04]Okay, granddad went to sleep already.
[144:34.26]I want to take shower after go to bed.
[144:36.74]I'm so tired.
[144:40.57]Take a shower.
[144:44.81]That doesn't have to be so loud.
[145:01.82]Am I in my... I don't have my clothes on?
[145:05.43]Close shower door.
[145:06.75]Oh, he's going to be right behind me.
[145:13.12]I'm gonna turn around and he's gonna be up against the glass.
[145:15.20]Am I pissing in the shower?
[145:28.96]I told you he was gonna be up-
[145:43.47]Wait, am I just naked?
[145:44.54]Oh, okay.
[145:48.32]I guess I was just naked walking around the house.
[145:50.10]Go to bed.
[145:50.60]Look at these windows.
[146:00.50]No.
[146:01.04]Fuck these windows.
[146:03.98]That's... Remember.
[146:06.24]We're talking waist down?
[146:08.30]No.
[146:09.55]This is fine from here up.
[146:11.89]Right here?
[146:12.49]Up?
[146:13.73]Good.
[146:15.21]Perfectly fine.
[146:16.81]This one?
[146:17.29]Get rid of it.
[146:18.29]I don't want it.
[146:22.90]Again, look.
[146:23.36]Here?
[146:24.40]Yeah, this curtain's here.
[146:25.22]Yeah, but... No, I want... Won't... Up.
[146:29.60]That's fine.
[146:39.76]You want basement windows everywhere?
[146:41.36]I mean, I guess.
[146:42.32]Another dream.
[146:43.82]Here comes another dream.
[146:45.38]Where am I?
[146:46.76]Elevator?
[146:48.94]Just another nightmare.
[146:49.86]Oh, all the buttons don't work.
[146:59.51]I guess I took five.
[147:04.17]Grandad?
[147:06.21]Grandad!
[147:13.16]What about three?
[147:22.50]What?
[147:23.52]Piggy?
[147:26.80]I really hope it's not going to start going... You know what I'm talking about.
[147:31.52]We're going to get pig sounds, I think.
[147:32.85]Prepare for them.
[148:02.93]That looked like the pig from the cookie video.
[148:05.65]The one where he's under the covers and he's like, a cookie's there?
[148:08.33]I thought they were gonna play that video.
[148:09.43]I thought it was gonna be like... I love that video.
[148:13.95]That's like the best video on the internet.
[148:17.66]Alright, so we have more buttons.
[148:18.66]Alright, let's go two.
[148:27.10]Ah.
[148:28.16]Brick wall.
[148:28.72]Okay.
[148:29.88]Okay.
[148:33.64]Uh, six.
[148:45.44]Hmm.
[148:47.08]Let's see.
[149:06.43]eat it eat eat eat eat eat eat eat okay I ate it he's gonna be right behind me
[149:44.18]Okay, no, we just ate it.
[149:45.80]That weird, gross thing.
[149:47.00]Ah!
[149:55.29]Eyes!
[149:56.87]Who's watching me?
[150:00.46]Isn't this supposed to be about granddad?
[150:02.14]We're in like a whole new video game.
[150:04.00]The Elevator Scare.
[150:08.39]This is... Okay, here's my theory.
[150:10.41]I think they made a different game.
[150:12.71]But maybe they thought that wasn't long enough.
[150:14.93]So they put the elevator scary game into this game.
[150:17.83]Which... Honestly, pretty fucking cool.
[150:21.81]Home?
[150:22.81]Finally.
[150:30.18]No.
[150:32.28]Nope.
[150:33.66]It's not home.
[150:34.58]Something different about it.
[150:38.15]Turn the lights on and off.
[150:40.27]Oh shit, this is real.
[150:42.39]If you're ever dreaming and you want to know if you're not dreaming or not, if you want to know the real tactic, this is for real.
[150:48.28]If you go to a light switch and flick it, if your lights turn off and on, you might be awake.
[150:56.18]Your brain has this problem with a few things.
[150:58.48]By the way, one of these don't fucking do it.
[151:02.04]Your brain has a problem with mirrors.
[151:03.88]So when you look in a mirror in a dream, your mind desperately tries to generate what a mirror actually is.
[151:12.24]So you will see some horrific shit in the mirror.
[151:16.01]So please do not do that.
[151:17.21]Actually, please don't.
[151:18.81]Also, reading text, a lot of times it looks kind of jumbled and doesn't make sense.
[151:23.13]You can't really read.
[151:24.59]And light switches seem to not work either.
[151:27.03]Your brain has a fun time of trying to understand.
[151:32.17]We have remarkable minds, by the way.
[151:35.67]When your brain, while you are asleep, is generating thoughts for you, but there's some things that it just cannot figure out.
[151:46.85]And flicking a light switch should work, but your mind cannot do it.
[151:53.54]And it's probably so annoyed that it can't.
[151:58.60]Generating God seeds?
[152:14.34]This whole game just has gone completely off the rails at this point.
[152:17.02]Wait, I'm in the hospital?
[152:19.38]Doctor, tell me, how is Alex?
[152:20.78]How is his health?
[152:23.00]Your grandson is in very serious condition.
[152:25.78]He fell through the map.
[152:27.94]And bumped his head.
[152:29.94]On the second level.
[152:32.34]Yes, unfortunately, we had the second level underneath the first level.
[152:35.74]Trying to save a little bit of time on the RAM.
[152:38.80]And the shader loading.
[152:40.72]And he bumped his head on it.
[152:42.22]And he's gonna die.
[152:44.60]The accident was serious, and he was very lucky to at least survive.
[152:47.46]The police have not determined the reason.
[152:50.26]Huh?
[152:50.42]We fought for his life for several hours.
[152:52.16]He's been on a ventilator for several weeks.
[153:09.92]He suffered multiple fractures, internal bleeding, and brain damage, and is still in unstable condition.
[153:16.45]It's impossible to say 100% that he'll be able to survive.
[153:20.11]Is there really nothing more that you can figure out?
[153:24.79]We continue to monitor his condition.
[153:26.29]His condition is improving, and we hope for a good outcome.
[153:30.74]I'll get back to you with news as soon as anything changes.
[153:34.38]Thank you, doctor.
[153:46.70]I fell through the game.
[153:48.44]The game ended?
[153:56.38]That was fucking crazy.
[153:57.54]Alright, that was called The Hidden Layer.
[154:00.77]That was a great one.
[154:13.71]So, was I just in a dream the whole time?
[154:23.87]That was fucking crazy.
[154:25.95]Okay.
[154:27.11]The next one is Big Head.
[154:32.32]Big Head.
[154:36.66]Also on Itch.io.
[154:39.60]All these have been on Itch.io, by the way, if you didn't know.
[154:52.76]That was your brain, that's your brain on bush light.
[154:55.00]Ah, this is really loud, hold on.
[155:14.85]A little bit better.
[155:15.69]Alright, English, big head.
[155:21.55]How we going over here?
[155:22.09]This thing doing cool shit?
[155:25.39]The longer a lava lamp is on, the more it breaks up into smaller pieces.
[155:28.49]So, pretty cool.
[155:31.97]Put it in French?
[155:32.63]I'm not gonna be able to understand anything.
[155:33.65]Why would I do that?
[155:41.85]Pretty good.
[155:46.66]Saturday night again, background music on the TV.
[155:59.95]yeah what do I what do I do I don't I can't seem to clicking
[156:19.62]Spacebar.
[156:21.51]1, 2, 3.
[156:22.89]A, B. Enter.
[156:26.19]Enter.
[156:28.07]I might need to reload this.
[156:28.93]Hold on.
[156:29.21]Let's try this again.
[156:49.00]Okay, start.
[156:52.98]Saturday night, background music on the TV.
[157:02.30]Why can I still press E?
[157:04.51]Oh, it's E, it's E, it's E. How did I press it?
[157:06.87]I pressed every button on my keyboard except for the letter E. I really enjoy being with you and having a good time.
[157:18.23]No matter that, our house doesn't have a roof.
[157:20.55]Any place is fine if we're together.
[157:23.79]I love you too.
[157:24.57]I've waited all week for this moment to come and sit down and enjoy some 30-year-old trashy horror movie.
[157:30.44]Fortunately, it's not raining.
[157:32.96]Or our things would get wet.
[157:35.22]Not having a roof is complicated, but the rent is so cheap.
[157:39.84]The forecasters aren't predicting rain, and you know they always get it right.
[157:43.46]I don't know how they do it.
[157:46.57]It's true.
[157:47.05]I love the Forecasters.
[157:47.97]They always get it right.
[157:49.27]What would we do without them?
[158:05.11]Nothing bad can happen tonight.
[158:07.11]We have to enjoy... My head hurts a bit.
[158:10.67]Could you make me some Linden tea?
[158:15.45]Okay, I'm coming, love.
[158:25.69]What are we?
[158:26.07]Is this like a colonoscopy on the TV?
[158:27.61]Who the fuck is this?
[158:34.08]So we don't have a roof?
[158:34.86]Okay.
[158:46.70]Service cut-off notices.
[158:49.05]We have a bunch of overdue bills to pay.
[158:50.85]You got one lemon in here?
[158:56.45]One lemon left to squeeze.
[159:00.04]Damn.
[159:04.68]Damn.
[159:07.68]A mug.
[159:08.00]I can use it to make tea for Roman.
[159:09.49]Alright, we need the Linden Tea, right?
[159:12.97]That tea right there?
[159:14.41]Flour.
[159:19.34]Tea?
[159:20.78]Lin- What's linden tea?
[159:21.98]Okay, heat the water.
[159:30.66]Kettle.
[159:32.08]Heat water.
[159:33.90]Turn on the stove.
[159:35.90]The flame looks kind of orange.
[159:37.18]Could be dangerous.
[159:39.48]Was orange good and blue bad?
[159:41.24]I never remember.
[159:43.58]We should buy one of those fancy electric kettles when we have money.
[159:46.16]Press E to wait.
[159:53.97]Linden is real tea?
[159:56.61]What does it taste like?
[160:00.65]Postponing it.
[160:01.45]Visiting my mom for two months.
[160:04.23]Wait.
[160:04.49]Continue to wait.
[160:12.31]Takes too long to boil.
[160:13.33]I'm getting anxious.
[160:14.07]Okay, it's almost done.
[160:23.83]It's ready.
[160:25.15]Water is hot and ready to make tea.
[160:29.87]There's going to be a huge face up there.
[160:31.29]I already know it.
[160:35.44]A mug I can use to make tea.
[160:36.42]Okay, so where's the tea?
[160:38.10]Give that to me.
[160:40.00]Alright, grab a tea bag.
[160:45.60]Uh-oh.
[160:46.80]Oh, shit.
[160:47.28]I think it's broken.
[160:49.30]Grab teabag.
[160:50.14]E. Space.
[160:53.41]Escape.
[160:55.15]Down.
[160:56.39]Up.
[160:57.85]E. E. Q. I'm softlocked.
[161:03.37]Tab.
[161:05.01]Shift.
[161:05.66]Control.
[161:06.22]Alt.
[161:07.36]T. Left shift.
[161:11.54]Escape.
[161:15.24]Okay, I... Hold on.
[161:19.28]I'm very curious about this one.
[161:21.83]Yeah, arrow keys don't do anything either.
[161:23.13]Shit!
[161:24.47]I'm blocked out.
[161:29.35]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[161:39.40]Alright, I gotta be very careful.
[161:42.08]E. We did this, yeah.
[161:43.78]We don't have a roof.
[161:44.86]I want tea.
[161:45.32]I want some Linden tea.
[161:46.11]We gotta boil the water.
[161:48.65]Yeah, mouse wheel didn't do it either.
[161:49.75]Okay, yep.
[161:53.19]Don't go too fast though, because it could be pretty delicate.
[161:56.03]Alright, we're good.
[162:01.46]Weird shit on the TV.
[162:02.60]Boil the water.
[162:03.24]There's the mug.
[162:09.67]Boil.
[162:11.01]Heat water.
[162:13.22]Turn on the stove.
[162:14.50]Now wait.
[162:14.94]E. When are you going to go bowling?
[162:27.13]I haven't been bowling in a long time.
[162:29.39]I hate bowling though.
[162:30.23]It enrages me.
[162:31.67]Does anybody else get enraged at bowling?
[162:36.81]There's two things that make me irrationally upset.
[162:39.23]And they're both recreational, like, teenager activities that people usually like.
[162:43.83]Mini golf and bowling.
[162:46.75]And the reason why that is is because I usually am very bad at them.
[162:49.97]And... After, like, an hour of hitting one pin and rage throwing the second ball and hitting three pins, I kind of just want to go play the two arcade machines.
[163:05.82]Mini golf is the same way, right?
[163:08.31]These are two activities that if you screw up bad, you are the one that sucks at the game.
[163:12.87]And it's usually one or two people.
[163:14.35]If you go with like five to ten people.
[163:15.57]Let's say you go with like six people.
[163:18.53]Somebody has to be the shitty bowler and the shitty mini golf player and it's always me.
[163:23.60]But I'll get one strike and scream about it.
[163:27.69]But yeah, it's annoying.
[163:29.85]Mini golf is pretty... When you do the putt and you do one, you miss.
[163:34.47]Two, you miss.
[163:35.67]And then you just kind of drag the ball around because you don't give a fuck anymore.
[163:39.66]Yeah.
[163:46.88]Mini golf is fun because everyone is bad.
[163:51.83]That's... Unfortunately, that is not true.
[163:55.88]There's always somebody that drains a hole-in-one and always is on par and... It's just the way it is.
[164:03.90]Alright, here we go.
[164:04.54]Don't fuck it up.
[164:07.69]Linden tea.
[164:09.29]Grab tea bag.
[164:11.23]Got it.
[164:16.79]Put tea bag in.
[164:19.36]Pour hot water.
[164:21.39]Tea is ready.
[164:50.98]You alright?
[164:53.08]My head hurts.
[164:55.32]I must be getting sick.
[164:57.27]Is my head big?
[164:58.01]Could you say I have a big head?
[164:59.39]I can't believe it.
[165:01.49]I just had to get sick on the weekend.
[165:03.95]Check if I have a fever.
[165:04.77]The thermometer's in the bathroom.
[165:26.70]Grab thermometer.
[165:30.31]Gonna be bigger, isn't it?
[165:31.09]See, those veins are turning into... rivers.
[165:50.76]On a topographical map.
[165:52.32]Do you have a fever?
[165:58.21]Everything's going to be fine.
[165:58.87]Don't worry.
[165:59.27]It must be the flu.
[166:08.62]This is an animated commercial.
[166:10.90]Yeah, this is a headache medicine commercial.
[166:13.82]Where his head would get really big.
[166:15.32]Like, my head is killing me.
[166:17.03]I've got a migraine.
[166:19.89]Take two of these, right?
[166:20.95]Yeah.
[166:22.21]Like the Gushers commercials where the heads get really big and exploded and stuff.
[166:33.51]That's airheads.
[166:38.86]Oh, sorry, sorry, it was a different- it was a different candy!
[166:41.86]Okay, if you're still feeling bad, we can go to the hospital.
[166:50.21]Uh, would you classify fruit snacks like Gushers as a candy?
[166:55.37]Are fruit snacks candy?
[166:58.85]I don't know if they're candy.
[167:04.14]Because they're kind of sold as a snack.
[167:07.44]Not necessarily as a candy.
[167:09.02]Like a candy bar.
[167:14.20]If they have enough sugar, yeah.
[167:19.22]Okay, is candy a snack?
[167:22.89]You have a raging fever.
[167:24.03]I don't know, is candy a snack?
[167:27.63]I feel like candy is its own tier.
[167:29.11]Candy is candy.
[167:32.53]There's some semantics there that are weird.
[167:35.16]Like, I don't consider candy to be a snack.
[167:39.32]I see it as candy.
[167:45.21]I can't take it anymore.
[167:45.83]My head is going to explode.
[167:48.15]Bring me the pills from the bedside table.
[167:50.99]Okay, well his head's going to be bigger and it's... What is the deal with this one?
[167:55.44]His head just keeps getting bigger until he's like out the ceiling?
[168:05.14]If all this says Tommy, I don't remember where it came from.
[168:14.85]Painkillers.
[168:16.57]Take them.
[168:16.85]Dude.
[168:34.69]Okay, you definitely heard that through my speakers.
[168:39.07]And it was actually louder than the game volume through desktop audio.
[168:46.68]That was louder through my microphone.
[168:54.87]I'm completely immersed.
[168:59.81]Here you go.
[169:00.17]I don't know if this is gonna be enough.
[169:02.23]I feel like my brain is trying to escape through my ears.
[169:05.47]Okay.
[169:32.20]What do you even say?
[169:32.90]Come on, come on, answer it.
[169:36.62]It's an emergency.
[169:37.36]They don't answer it.
[169:49.53]I need an ambulance.
[169:50.33]This is really sad for the guy.
[169:58.96]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[170:01.58]Good evening, what emergency assistance do you need?
[170:04.09]My husband has a very large head.
[170:05.65]A very large head, you say?
[170:08.49]Your husband has a very large head?
[170:10.70]Yes, excessively large.
[170:11.84]I need an ambulance.
[170:14.01]Floods?
[170:41.51]I have to free up the line.
[170:42.35]I'm sorry.
[170:43.81]I can't believe they're not going to help us.
[170:46.11]Bloods?
[170:48.28]Uh-oh.
[171:00.10]Emergencia.
[171:06.66]What do I do?
[171:07.24]I have a wrong muscle.
[171:09.86]How can that be?
[171:11.71]What are you talking about?
[171:12.41]I'll help you, Roman.
[171:13.29]You'll be fine.
[171:13.77]Hang in there.
[171:15.12]Those damn forecasters got it wrong.
[171:16.80]It's raining!
[171:18.54]All our things are wet.
[171:20.46]What's going on?
[171:22.02]Roman, are you okay?
[171:43.03]I'll help it.
[171:46.33]Lip.
[171:48.70]Word.
[171:52.14]Good.
[171:53.88]I old.
[171:55.34]Oh.
[171:56.92]You.
[172:02.49]Ma'am, I have.
[172:05.75]Alderaan.
[172:46.24]Are we going to float up to the sky?
[172:47.56]Oh, weird.
[173:02.06]I don't like this.
[173:02.94]This is weird.
[173:06.70]This would be so scary if it actually really happened.
[173:22.58]Yeah?
[173:23.26]What do you mean, yeah?
[173:24.14]What do you mean, yeah?
[173:30.36]I'm immersing myself in the universe and I said, would this be scary if this really happened?
[173:33.76]People go, yeah, with a question mark.
[173:35.77]Yeah, like, yeah, it would be.
[173:37.11]This would be fucking crazy.
[173:43.27]Yeah.
[173:49.75]Yeah, no shit.
[173:52.23]Yeah!
[173:58.70]Okay, that was called Big Head.
[173:59.80]I think that's it.
[174:00.84]Alright, the person wrote it like this, okay?
[174:10.02]They wrote- they went like this.
[174:13.64]There was a space after the yeah.
[174:21.64]Okay.
[174:22.82]Uh, that was Big Head.
[174:24.16]Cool.
[174:29.98]Okay, we have... There's a lot more.
[174:32.08]How about The Ferry?
[174:39.81]This one's called The Ferry.
[174:40.99]Yeah.
[174:52.47]Uh, volume seems good.
[174:55.90]Maybe a little bit louder.
[174:59.48]The ferry.
[175:06.57]I was looking through the job section when I found an ad for a ferryman.
[175:09.91]Apparently the town of Skoto Bay is having a festival and the regular ferryman broke his leg.
[175:14.79]They're offering a hefty bonus due to such short notice.
[175:18.46]The ferry goes to an island that's famous as a camping spot.
[175:21.72]So it'll be pretty busy.
[175:23.48]It'll still be easy money.
[175:24.96]I called them and was on the road for within an hour.
[175:26.92]Okay.
[175:27.06]Let's go.
[175:32.81]Checklist.
[175:33.91]Sprint.
[175:36.03]Raise the gate to allow cars to approach.
[175:38.19]Direct cars onto the boat.
[175:40.85]You can load up to four cars, but it's okay to leave with fewer.
[175:44.22]Watch for stragglers and try not to run behind schedule.
[175:48.58]Alright, hold on.
[175:49.86]When the cars are loaded up, press the button by the ramp.
[175:51.91]It will lock automatically.
[175:53.05]Alright, raise the gate.
[175:55.21]Allow cars to approach.
[175:55.97]Direct cars onto the boat.
[175:58.99]That's the boat.
[176:00.83]Cars approach.
[176:08.81]Okay, four cars can be on.
[176:14.13]So let's get cars on here.
[176:14.77]Let's go.
[176:15.05]I'm ready.
[176:47.78]Ah, I see you made it.
[176:48.56]Who is this?
[176:48.98]Well, I'm the owner of that there ferry.
[176:50.63]Didn't you get my note?
[176:52.19]Oh yeah, nice to meet you.
[177:14.75]Just be kind to my boat and we'll call it a pleasure after all.
[177:18.13]Uh, you know what you need to do.
[177:20.44]Yeah, seems simple enough.
[177:23.30]Very well then, just press that there button to raise the gate and let's get a move on.
[177:26.94]Okay.
[177:34.81]Come on in.
[177:50.35]You're good.
[177:50.73]Go on.
[177:52.33]Next lane, please.
[177:53.01]I can do four cars, right?
[178:05.62]Go ahead.
[178:10.06]On you go.
[178:16.83]Is that a bush light?
[178:17.79]Yeah, you better believe it.
[178:23.22]Take the open lane.
[178:25.22]By the sea, this is a... What did he say?
[178:30.89]What did he say?
[178:33.95]Hey, uh... What was that?
[178:37.85]What was that?
[178:38.23]Excuse me?
[178:39.25]Oh, shit, I didn't think I was going to be sitting here for this long.
[178:48.99]Okay, then we get on the boat.
[178:52.09]We move it.
[179:12.73]How do I close it up?
[179:15.43]Oh, right here.
[179:20.94]Is this how this actually works?
[179:25.18]Ah, listen to her engine purr.
[179:26.46]She'll keep a steady pace as long as you hold the lever down.
[179:32.22]Let's go.
[179:51.53]I've been making these trips for as long as I can remember.
[179:54.47]I will... Hold on, I can't... It's very quiet.
[179:58.05]As it should be.
[179:58.61]I don't hit shit, right?
[180:09.70]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[180:13.28]We get a bush check?
[180:16.90]Yes!
[180:42.80]No gate on the island, so just load any waiting cars and head back to shore.
[180:46.12]Okay, so just... Let them out.
[180:52.61]Alright, have a good time.
[180:55.41]See you later.
[180:58.69]Goodbye.
[181:01.47]Have a good night.
[181:06.47]See you later.
[181:18.64]You're good.
[181:26.42]Hope the storm isn't a bad one.
[181:31.22]A Criken is going to jump up and kill us.
[181:53.54]Is there a storm coming?
[181:55.88]What gave you that idea?
[181:58.54]A passenger mentioned it.
[182:05.94]Ah yes, just checked with Coast Guard and a freak storm is brewing out to sea.
[182:13.79]Who the fuck is that?
[182:17.67]I'm not gonna get boarded, am I?
[182:18.77]I'm gonna get boarded.
[182:47.22]Freak Storm or Freak Needle?
[182:49.60]Uh, I hear Freak Needle.
[183:05.68]Okay.
[183:06.11]Get out of here.
[183:08.29]Drive safe.
[183:08.93]Damn storm is ruining my weekend.
[183:13.79]Okay.
[183:15.33]Have a good night.
[183:17.64]Alright, come on, let's keep going.
[183:21.70]Need four cars, right?
[183:32.60]One of these are going to be a weird screaming face, right?
[183:39.15]I didn't like fucking.
[183:45.81]I didn't like fucking.
[183:56.83]Go ahead.
[184:00.63]Alright, we're good.
[184:12.75]Go.
[184:19.62]So how'd you like it so far?
[184:22.18]Pretty easy.
[184:22.72]I could get used to this, yeah.
[184:25.46]Well don't.
[184:26.30]Do you have any questions for me?
[184:29.40]Tell me about the festival.
[184:38.21]You can read.
[184:38.67]Uh, one night the village was destroyed and the survivors built the current town.
[184:44.61]That was 200 years ago to the night.
[184:50.02]So it's the town's birthday.
[184:53.28]More like a memorial to the old village.
[184:57.09]Shore life is full of hazards, and we shouldn't forget that.
[185:03.80]I'm just holding this so when the jump scare happens, it'll splash all over me for the thumbnail.
[185:07.46]It'll be like so scary, I got my bush light all over me.
[185:19.82]Why am I fucking drinking this?
[185:36.94]It's good.
[185:43.72]Does one beer do anything to you?
[185:46.85]I'm not drinking it to get shitfaced.
[185:48.31]I'm just trying to just drink it.
[185:49.61]Alright, you're all set.
[185:54.35]Enjoy your evening.
[186:02.31]Have a good night.
[186:04.82]May you be blessed.
[186:08.95]Alright.
[186:19.79]Take the open lane.
[186:20.57]Go on.
[186:24.32]There's only two cars.
[186:27.22]Those campers weren't happy about the evacuation order.
[186:29.44]Uh-oh.
[186:42.79]Next lane, please.
[186:48.14]Alright, we're good.
[186:56.82]I like this boat.
[186:58.00]This is like a cute boat.
[186:59.32]I like it.
[187:03.33]Also, we can probably snooze the ad in like 30-40 seconds so we get the maximum amount of snooze.
[187:09.33]I feel like we only got about 5 or 6 minutes in this.
[187:11.41]I'll take a break after.
[187:28.38]Hey, watch it.
[187:28.86]I heard that all the way over here.
[187:31.80]What?
[187:33.24]Wait, I hit something?
[187:34.06]Try to pay more attention next time.
[187:38.44]I won't... I don't... Wait, what did I hit?
[187:40.18]I didn't see anything.
[187:57.21]It was the Criken.
[188:25.28]You ran the Criken over with the boat?
[188:26.88]Yeah, apparently I killed the Criken with my boat.
[188:37.34]When we come back from the break after this one... I almost just drove this onto the shore.
[188:41.33]Uh, I'm gonna play that one that was a meme for a long time.
[188:45.43]It's called, like, Don't Scream.
[188:47.67]Your microphone will pick it up or something.
[188:49.99]I'll try it.
[188:50.41]Okay.
[189:02.27]I got these bush light burps.
[189:03.63]Alright, next lane.
[189:05.23]Let's go.
[189:13.65]That game is scary?
[189:15.31]Okay.
[189:18.72]There's like 15 minutes left in the game.
[189:27.66]You might need to take a break.
[189:29.12]Oh, okay.
[189:30.18]Alright, I'll just do that then.
[189:34.25]Hey, close it up.
[189:40.53]You're going to burp and it's going to get you killed.
[189:43.51]I'll be alright.
[189:55.91]Please take the break.
[189:56.65]I have to pee so bad.
[189:58.47]We'll take it.
[189:59.01]Hold on.
[189:59.43]Don't worry.
[190:10.69]Why are you taking people onto the island if there's an evacuation?
[190:16.82]Yeah, why am I doing that?
[190:18.24]Why are we doing this?
[190:23.80]Sounds like the old girl's stall.
[190:25.15]Don't worry, it's nothing complicated like a fuse box or anything.
[190:30.01]Just head below and you'll find a valve.
[190:32.33]Turn it and she'll be right as rain.
[190:35.33]Okay.
[190:39.85]Ah, nobody be alarmed.
[190:41.07]Nothing wrong.
[190:43.83]Just ran into something real quick.
[190:44.97]I just have to open that person's door.
[190:48.22]Alright, wait, where is it?
[190:58.92]We good?
[191:04.93]Relax.
[191:09.70]What a dick.
[191:10.56]It was 10 seconds.
[191:18.84]Hey, you're on a modern Marvel of engineering.
[191:21.98]You have your vehicle inside of a boat that is taking you across a body of water.
[191:27.00]Cavemen used to die in this lake.
[191:30.29]They would drown in here trying to cross it.
[191:34.05]Shut up.
[191:42.03]Feed that guy to the Criken.
[191:52.57]Who beeped?
[191:54.15]Your service to the town will not be forgotten.
[191:58.43]Oh, yeah.
[191:58.79]So you're trying to make up for what you're beeping.
[192:01.55]Yeah, that's so I don't post what you did on TikTok.
[192:06.43]Okay.
[192:14.03]See you later.
[192:18.69]Alright, I'll take the break.
[192:20.31]I'll be back in like three or four minutes.
[192:22.33]And we'll finish this one and we'll do the don't scream into your microphone.
[192:26.22]Otherwise it ends the game.
[192:28.50]I'll be back.
[192:32.56]This is calming music.
[192:33.34]We'll keep it on.
[192:35.44]See you in a few minutes.
[192:39.22]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[192:42.92]Should we get a fresh bush?
[192:44.64]Light?
[192:44.86]See you in a minute.
[193:48.09]Thank you.
[194:22.81]you
[194:55.27]you
[196:03.56]you
[196:36.03]you
[196:59.06]I have returned.
[197:27.46]It's funny because these are so cold.
[197:29.54]It's so hot in this room.
[197:33.18]That's actually kind of nice to drink these.
[197:37.69]And so a cold beer versus a cold soda.
[197:45.18]It kind of hits a little different, doesn't it?
[197:55.50]Do I use conditioner?
[197:56.78]Yes, I do.
[197:57.02]Alright, it's going to be loud.
[197:58.66]I always feel like it's going to peak the mic.
[198:06.33]Is this your eighth beer?
[198:07.41]This is beer number two.
[198:10.25]So no, we're doing just mine.
[198:14.21]Alright, ready?
[198:15.19]Almost at the end of this one.
[198:26.05]Yeah, they're evacuating from here.
[198:28.17]Go ahead.
[198:35.66]Open lane, go ahead.
[198:43.76]Are you drinking it for the flavor?
[198:47.18]I'm drinking it for the experience.
[198:50.04]That ice cold frothy.
[198:53.10]With a little bit of bite at the end.
[198:56.64]That's how you know you've got a bush.
[198:59.58]Bam.
[199:21.33]Oh, it's exquisite.
[199:23.44]So, how was the old village destroyed?
[199:24.86]What happened?
[199:26.79]Nobody knows, probably was just a freak storm like the one we're expecting tonight.
[199:32.40]Or a huge wave come on shore like one of the tsunami things.
[199:38.10]The kids think it was revenge.
[199:40.61]Revenge.
[199:44.61]Yeah, sailors come to town with their stories and the kids eat them up.
[199:49.97]Kids are always talking about ghosts and goblins.
[199:57.64]Hey, look kid, these freak storms are no joke and there are more people to evacuate.
[200:01.20]Let's focus on that and we can talk tall tales after everyone's safe, alright?
[200:13.25]You gonna play the Oblivion remake if it's real and true?
[200:15.27]Uh... No, probably not.
[200:26.26]Why?
[200:26.60]I don't know.
[200:28.30]I don't feel like it.
[200:31.68]I don't feel like it.
[200:32.32]What?
[200:41.29]Strange note.
[200:42.21]They're lying.
[200:43.13]Leave before they find out.
[200:44.63]I warned you.
[200:47.37]Who's lying?
[200:47.99]Guy on the radio?
[200:57.31]See you later.
[200:58.49]I should be home in time for the banquet.
[201:02.69]Drive safe.
[201:11.96]Wait, so is it an Oblivion remake?
[201:14.64]Or is it we're porting Oblivion to the Switch 2?
[201:19.75]Which one is it?
[201:25.08]Oh wait, it's not real.
[201:26.32]It hasn't been confirmed.
[201:27.14]OK.
[201:27.28]Alright.
[201:34.66]It's a remake slash remaster.
[201:36.40]Gone.
[201:47.12]Gone.
[201:50.02]Let's go.
[202:15.92]Ever surreal how many people are watching?
[202:18.10]How many people here now?
[202:21.56]15.
[202:23.20]Big 16 people.
[202:31.19]It's three people.
[202:33.51]Oh.
[202:40.21]Watch it.
[202:45.69]Are those eyes or is that headlights?
[202:56.45]There's at least one dog here, probably.
[203:06.42]Hey listen kid, this will probably be the last trip back, so I'm off to bed.
[203:09.58]You did good tonight and we appreciate it more than you'll ever know.
[203:37.98]Okay, yes.
[203:42.10]The path to heaven is clear even for you.
[203:47.79]Am I... what's his name from the Greek mythology?
[203:51.67]Am I... what's his name?
[203:53.25]Charon?
[203:56.01]Hey, please don't leave yet.
[203:56.93]My girlfriend called and asked me to get her.
[204:00.96]Okay, I'll keep a spot open.
[204:09.80]Hades reference, Batchest.
[204:11.64]No, that is a mythology reference.
[204:23.52]The evacuation is nearly complete.
[204:24.86]Let's wait for everybody.
[204:29.05]That's a Smite reference, dude.
[204:30.35]Dude, Smite!
[204:31.63]Yeah, that's the- that- that character from- that champion from Smite.
[204:37.51]God, I hope we write shit down.
[204:38.89]I hope we- we- the books are full of information in the next, like, hundred years.
[204:42.91]People are really gonna think that, like, Hades was from Smite.
[204:46.13]Not- like, an old god.
[204:48.63]Please, please write some stuff down.
[205:01.13]We got church tomorrow.
[205:02.03]You're drinking too much.
[205:05.82]Alright, storm's getting too close.
[205:10.10]Let's get out of here.
[205:18.35]Hey, it ain't the Sabbath yet.
[205:19.97]Oh God.
[205:37.79]I just tried to drink the can upside down to get the label in the frame.
[205:41.63]That would have been bad.
[205:56.34]Why am I doing this?
[205:59.86]I infiltrated my own mind.
[206:04.46]I saw something.
[206:05.10]Wait, what was that?
[206:15.66]Oh, dude, I hope we got a priest, a healer, a warrior, and a paladin on board.
[206:21.59]Hope that's who's in these cars.
[206:26.96]Oof, I deleted that one.
[206:45.58]Are we good?
[206:47.08]What happens?
[206:50.38]All this slow buildup is because a fucking Satan is going to jump out of the water.
[206:54.40]Like, that's obviously what's happening.
[206:59.10]Satan is going to jump out of the water right now.
[207:00.90]Oh, he's going to be behind me.
[207:06.45]Satan's going to be behind me.
[207:10.25]Okay.
[207:10.99]No, we're good.
[207:19.38]Drive safe.
[207:22.76]See you later.
[207:48.37]Last trip, right?
[208:03.94]This is a hearse.
[208:09.23]Everyone's been evacuated.
[208:10.27]There is one casualty this night.
[208:12.47]We must deliver their body.
[208:15.47]OK, but let's make it fast.
[208:16.71]It's gonna be me.
[208:18.60]Agreed.
[208:22.02]I'm in the back.
[208:25.43]Satan's gonna jump out of that thing.
[208:59.92]Something's coming out of the box, right?
[209:29.13]Dude, some- mmmm.
[210:14.10]Oh, holy shit!
[210:19.23]What the fuck?
[210:22.15]That was so cool!
[210:27.28]That wasn't even, like, scary.
[210:28.52]That was just cool.
[210:30.56]The Doc was the monster?
[210:35.60]That night, a creature known only to the people of Scotto Bay awoke and consumed the town's peace offering.
[210:42.29]Satisfied in this exchange, the beast settled back down and vengeance was averted for another century.
[210:48.53]The next morning, the ferryman returned to duty in a boat identical to the one sacrificed and went about business as usual.
[210:56.13]People once again flocked to the island getaway, never knowing that the beast, sometimes mentioned in hushed whispers by the townsfolk, was sleeping in plain sight.
[211:06.89]Okay, that was... That was a slow burn, but that was cool.
[211:15.49]That was the ferry.
[211:17.99]Cool.
[211:22.31]That was predictable, but nice execution.
[211:24.05]I thought something was going to come out of the water.
[211:26.66]And it was the dock was alive.
[211:29.94]And it was eating things.
[211:31.68]When we were the other way, it was eating them.
[211:36.24]Alright, time to play the one where you scream and it's a screamer.
[211:39.48]The whole game is a screamer.
[211:41.98]So, it's late at night.
[211:44.76]Welcome to hell.
[211:46.36]Because this is going to be a scream one.
[211:48.36]I can't wait.
[211:49.37]I'm glad I'm like a beer and a half deep.
[211:53.75]Can't wait to scream!
[211:56.33]These ones have been kind of chill and spooky and weird.
[211:58.71]I like the few of these.
[211:59.87]Yeah, it's don't scream is the one.
[212:11.88]Let's go ahead and do it.
[212:20.76]Adjust the settings?
[212:21.86]I'll get them.
[212:24.12]I'll adjust it.
[212:30.04]Don't scream contains flashing lights, intense audio, and potentially distressing content.
[212:36.18]Okay.
[212:38.86]Dead.
[212:39.22]Dead.
[212:41.81]Let me make sure it's got the right mic.
[212:49.75]Okay.
[212:55.41]Press start automatic calibration and softly whisper the sentence into your microphone.
[213:00.12]Alright, here we go.
[213:07.85]In a silent forest, the trees stand frozen, caught between time and space.
[213:15.58]Every step... Okay, so this is how loud I can be?
[213:23.22]Hold on.
[213:27.20]In a silent forest, the trees stand frozen, caught between time and space.
[213:33.34]Every step feels endless.
[213:36.51]Okay, so...
[213:39.06]So, I just be quiet.
[213:41.05]Okay.
[213:42.87]I think we're good.
[213:44.41]I think we're okay.
[213:47.61]We're good.
[213:49.15]I just can't talk.
[213:51.03]Okay.
[213:55.94]Let's go.
[213:58.02]Don't fucking scream.
[214:00.56]Alright.
[214:04.22]Shh.
[214:05.76]Shh.
[214:06.12]Shut up.
[214:20.61]I'm gonna fucking hate this one.
[214:26.01]Get it out of your system now!
[214:27.13]Okay, survive 18 minutes without screaming.
[214:35.57]Watch your camera's battery.
[214:37.25]Meter and click blue power batteries.
[214:38.63]Use the arrow marker on the tablet to find new locations.
[214:45.17]I'm going to play this game for fucking five minutes and uninstall it, okay?
[214:49.41]I don't care.
[214:49.85]Have I burped too loud?
[214:57.05]That's going to happen.
[215:34.10]SOS confirmed.
[215:38.91]A pickup is en route and will arrive by 0600 hours.
[215:43.57]Over.
[217:39.53]Bark!
[217:40.10]Bark!
[218:11.25]It's so bad.
[218:13.81]There's a lot of things that I have to say.
[220:07.04]What the fuck are you talking about?
[220:08.42]I didn't scream.
[220:09.22]I didn't scream.
[220:11.90]The name of the game is Don't... It's Don't Scream, not Don't Die.
[220:16.50]Don't Scream, not Don't Die.
[220:17.88]What are you talking about?
[220:19.18]I didn't scream.
[220:19.94]I didn't think the game was Don't Die in the Shed.
[220:28.79]What?
[220:30.39]I walked into a rake and it hit me in the face like Sideshow Bob.
[220:35.12]I was doing so good.
[220:36.12]I got to do that again?
[220:38.14]I didn't think it was whatever.
[220:56.78]I don't care.
[221:09.47]The graphics are actually pretty good.
[221:13.26]The graphics are really good.
[221:36.20]Imagine getting scared by a fucking bird.
[221:42.04]Like, honestly, imagine getting scared by a fucking bird.
[221:45.02]Who's getting scared by a bird?
[221:48.18]Who is playing this and getting scared by the bird?
[221:51.36]They're like, it's like, holy shit, man.
[221:54.04]You don't don't play horror games.
[221:55.46]If you're scared by a bird, don't do that.
[222:02.55]You can't.
[222:04.01]I can't stop talking.
[222:22.41]Hey, I know you can hear me.
[222:23.53]You can hear me on the street.
[222:25.31]If I stay far enough away from the mic.
[222:27.93]What was with the birds just roughing out of the sky?
[222:29.97]Dying?
[222:32.09]What the fuck was that?
[222:34.03]It was just dead birds falling down?
[222:36.43]Alright, I got way too much to say.
[222:41.64]Let's go.
[222:42.24]Do it again.
[222:42.60]Run it back.
[222:43.00]Let's go.
[222:44.98]Like, I wanted to laugh.
[222:46.08]Alright, shh.
[223:02.16]It's too sensitive?
[223:06.10]Hello?
[223:07.80]Hello?
[223:09.16]Hello?
[223:12.24]Hello?
[223:12.62]Is this better?
[223:14.46]How's that?
[223:16.90]A, B, C, D, this... Ah!
[223:21.37]Oh!
[223:23.27]Okay, so I can do it like this?
[223:25.77]Maybe like this?
[223:27.75]Oh!
[223:27.85]Oh!
[223:29.69]Oh!
[223:32.77]Better?
[223:33.89]That's better, right?
[223:39.78]Okay, I think it's fine.
[223:41.78]This is cheating.
[223:42.48]Yeah, fuck that.
[223:44.44]Hey, how you doing?
[223:45.56]Yeah, okay.
[223:47.18]That's fine.
[223:47.80]That's good.
[223:51.32]You playing on easy mode?
[223:53.72]No, this is fine.
[223:56.75]I'm not going to talk.
[223:57.93]Yeah, look at this.
[224:00.47]Okay, here we go.
[224:03.26]Go.
[224:58.66]Is this gonna kill me?
[225:11.25]Yeah.
[225:12.73]Yeah.
[225:23.70]I gotta say, when you tell me don't talk, this is the one thing that I have.
[225:29.29]It's the only thing I have.
[225:33.11]All I got is talk.
[225:35.87]All I know how to do is talk.
[225:38.37]It's the only thing I have.
[225:42.02]So telling me to talk is like telling telling like a pilot not to fly.
[229:06.02]people chat and it's I'm gonna laugh I'm not gonna get scared I'm gonna laugh
[230:18.42]Yeah.
[230:19.88]Yeah.
[232:45.58]And when did it tell me the water was 50 feet deep?
[232:52.03]I thought it was up to my shins.
[232:55.65]I thought it was... What?
[233:01.75]I thought that was going to be up to my shins.
[233:12.04]Don't swim, don't talk, don't bleed, don't die, don't everything.
[233:34.45]They changed the game to don't everything.
[233:36.65]Don't everything.
[233:39.77]Don't burp.
[233:40.33]Don't fart.
[233:40.91]Don't fucking sneeze.
[233:42.10]Don't everything.
[233:46.82]It's not don't scream.
[233:47.90]It's don't do anything.
[233:56.93]I'll get it.
[237:48.99]You guys are being too funny in chat.
[237:57.56]You need to stop being so funny.
[238:08.13]Turn the sensitivity.
[238:09.05]No, it's perfect.
[238:10.97]Just let me get through this.
[238:30.42]Hey, how's that?
[238:51.30]There you go.
[238:52.07]There you go.
[238:52.61]So I can talk to you like this.
[238:53.73]Didn't pick that up.
[238:57.25]That's good.
[238:59.74]I can talk to you like this.
[239:01.52]There we go.
[239:03.30]Okay.
[239:05.14]So.
[239:06.96]We are playing Jump.
[239:09.10]Freaking Scream.
[239:12.31]It just came out.
[239:13.81]It's on Steam.
[239:14.81]It came out two years ago.
[239:24.68]Imagine being this late to the fucking party.
[239:33.25]Why is this person's face blurred?
[239:43.25]It's supposed to be scary.
[240:18.39]It's an abandoned house.
[240:32.68]Hey guys, should we go in?
[241:25.27]Girls.
[241:27.89]Are there moose in here?
[241:48.34]Oh.
[243:10.88]That's the moose.
[243:58.76]I'm sorry.
[246:19.34]We made it out.
[247:04.22]Thank you.
[247:40.04]It was a spider.
[247:40.82]Oh.
[248:22.55]Stairs.
[248:22.93]Home.
[248:23.29]Home.
[248:51.56]Ah!
[248:52.94]Ah!
[249:42.18]Bros, make sure you subscribe.
[249:44.28]I shit my pants three times already.
[249:48.65]Make sure you subscribe to the channel for more scary playthroughs.
[251:27.18]Anyone else there?
[252:27.35]I WAS HOLDING SHIFT, I RAN OUT OF STAMINA!
[252:32.09]I wasted my sprint?
[252:33.71]How?
[252:34.33]What?
[252:39.73]I was li- uh, whatever.
[252:42.90]Uh, this one's kind of fun.
[252:44.12]I like this one, actually.
[252:45.12]Uh, I am coming up on an ad break.
[252:49.94]I'll take it.
[252:51.32]I was going to do a funny thing where I told the mods to snooze it in a funny little whisper.
[252:57.95]But I got killed.
[252:58.53]I'll be back in three minutes.
[253:02.67]I'm going to do this one more time and then we'll move on.
[253:05.47]Here we go.
[254:37.75]Okay.
[255:19.99]Thank you.
[256:42.82]Thank you.
[257:24.70]How's it going?
[257:27.64]We need a bush light check.
[257:30.26]I'm drinking the same one from an hour ago.
[257:37.26]How's POE 2?
[257:37.88]It was fun.
[257:40.26]I'm going to probably keep playing it.
[257:41.48]I think it's a good game.
[257:48.02]What about the bong rip?
[257:49.24]I would never do that.
[257:51.88]Not in 100 million years.
[258:06.44]You don't smoke it?
[258:07.06]You eat it?
[258:08.84]It depends.
[258:09.24]It's been a while, though.
[258:14.28]This is the first time I've had anything like this in months.
[258:25.19]But I did... I got a backup bush light.
[258:28.99]This one's so much colder.
[258:31.16]I'm going to drink this one.
[258:35.19]Beer like this.
[258:36.97]Because it is so hot in this room.
[258:43.05]It gets so hot in here.
[258:45.45]It's funny.
[258:45.73]One of the reasons why I started screaming from a couch is because.
[258:49.07]It just in this room is like engulfed in flames.
[258:54.41]It's like 80 plus degrees in here sometimes.
[258:58.19]So anything in the room?
[259:00.57]Just gets so warm so quickly.
[259:06.10]Three beers is getting crazy?
[259:07.28]Well, this would be... There's still a little bit left in this one.
[259:12.50]No, it's not the lava lamp.
[259:14.24]That has nothing to do with it.
[259:21.34]This thing is... This is like warm.
[259:28.63]Has it been cool though?
[259:33.85]Something to look at?
[259:45.76]Hey, Dev here.
[259:46.60]You're making my hard work look bad.
[259:48.22]Please adjust your settings.
[259:49.24]Is that the real Dev?
[259:57.39]No.
[260:04.61]I adjusted them.
[260:09.20]Pour warm beer into a glass?
[260:14.72]look I'm I'm adjusted I'm adjusted look I'm adjusted you see I can talk like this and I can whisper I just haven't been talking because I'm locked the in hey it's called getting locked in here we go last attempt visit
[260:46.93]OK.
[260:49.23]Last one.
[260:53.01]Let's go.
[260:59.83]10 subs if you drink the lava lamp.
[261:02.95]Add like 5 zeros.
[261:05.72]No, like 10 zeros actually.
[261:07.12]Fuck that.
[261:16.15]No, I'm not doing that for anybody.
[261:17.65]This game is pretty fun though.
[261:42.24]Here's what I like about the game.
[261:43.38]I'll tell you what I like about it.
[261:47.23]I like how each zone you probably could just sit at each instance like the lonely well.
[261:54.57]I could probably just sit here for 18 minutes and different stuff would happen in here.
[262:00.30]That's kind of cool because I was at that house for like 10 minutes.
[262:03.56]And just a bunch of shit was happening in the house.
[262:07.11]That's pretty cool.
[262:28.36]Was it?
[262:31.53]Treehouse.
[262:36.31]Well, that almost scared the fuck out of me.
[262:40.39]I was I was lost.
[262:58.75]You could fall asleep to your soft voice reading stories.
[263:07.96]What kind of stories?
[263:15.79]I know, yeah, I gotta lock in.
[263:17.64]Excuse me.
[263:37.38]Fucked up, whatever that is.
[263:38.24]Oh, this is so cold.
[263:48.79]I ironically like it.
[264:01.19]Ancient ruins.
[264:03.93]He chatters.
[264:05.17]Should I explore the ancient ruins?
[264:07.63]He chatters.
[264:12.39]I'm gonna let you decide.
[265:10.56]Actually, just give me the chill for a second.
[265:12.12]I think I would be a spider.
[265:33.03]I just continued a conversation that we were having like nine days ago, by the way.
[266:00.66]Be able to die via spider.
[266:08.81]I think it makes total sense.
[266:15.55]We just sneezed.
[266:28.23]That's some Home Alone shit.
[266:30.12]I could have just gotten marved right there.
[266:36.63]Where is that little shit, by the way?
[267:13.02]little coughing guy is not scary it's funny I want to make sure I have old stamina
[267:52.99]Motherfucker, that could've killed me.
[267:58.51]Editor!
[267:58.79]You're a fuckin' person here.
[268:32.02]I'm not freaking out.
[268:32.80]I'm not freaking out.
[268:33.35]I'm afraid this has never been coming up.
[268:38.30]Keep standing up.
[269:02.46]Hmm.
[269:02.62]Hmm.
[269:45.47]I draw a penis
[270:45.47]Don't sprint, don't sprint.
[270:47.27]I'm gonna need it in a second probably.
[270:48.47]This is where I lost last time.
[270:56.28]Need to be able to sprint.
[271:12.33]Regular dog.
[271:12.97]A regular dog.
[271:16.29]Almost lost to a regular dog.
[271:36.02]Oh shit, I'm going in this plane!
[272:12.88]Get the battery and then...
[273:03.57]OK.
[273:03.93]OK.
[273:04.23]I think I'll find it.
[273:32.86]Don't run, don't run.
[273:34.02]Save stamina.
[273:34.60]Oh, okay.
[273:40.89]I think we're good.
[273:53.10]It's like a gas station.
[274:21.77]Oh, it's dead bodies, bro.
[274:23.43]Dude.
[274:42.88]Gonna grab you.
[274:45.88]They're gonna grab you.
[274:57.71]Squeeze in there.
[274:58.88]Pick up the pumpkin.
[274:59.68]Go through this door.
[275:35.21]My battery really bad.
[275:42.14]Where's the battery?
[275:45.27]Where's the fucking battery?
[276:20.14]Excuse me, I didn't know it was occupied.
[276:51.18]Get me the fuck out of here.
[277:00.09]Bro, that was fucked.
[277:31.66]How do I get out of here?
[277:33.66]That fucking weirdo is in the bathroom.
[277:48.80]Okay.
[278:16.31]Two minutes.
[278:18.58]They're gonna start to fuck with me so bad now.
[279:10.80]I always want to be moving
[280:17.04]Fuck you, he's behind me.
[280:18.15]Fuck you.
[281:49.58]Yes!
[281:53.60]Dude, that last one was bad.
[281:55.51]That was really bad.
[281:58.71]I knew it was coming.
[282:00.05]You don't go to zero seconds and have that happen.
[282:05.27]21 scares.
[282:05.85]Cool.
[282:11.11]That was hard to not yell.
[282:14.73]That was actually really fun.
[282:19.79]That's a clap.
[282:20.31]That was really good.
[282:20.93]Oh, you can see your progress?
[282:26.61]20.
[282:28.65]There's 41 locations.
[282:32.51]Holy shit.
[282:32.97]There's actually a lot of content.
[282:42.50]Cool.
[282:45.50]View relics.
[282:48.44]Oh, right.
[282:53.14]Yeah, I thought that was great.
[282:54.94]I thought that was very good.
[282:55.96]That was Don't Scream.
[282:58.24]People lost 6.5 million channel points on that one.
[283:02.96]Wow.
[283:07.25]Oh man, the doubters got obliterated.
[283:11.67]Like, absolutely, completely obliterated.
[283:19.88]Damn, I thought I was going to get screwed in.
[283:21.60]OK, in the convenience store.
[283:24.20]When they all went boom, they all I thought something was going to jump at me.
[283:26.94]I was it would have been in the bathroom.
[283:28.88]I thought that guy was going to turn.
[283:29.76]I was preparing for him to turn around.
[283:32.06]Didn't happen.
[283:35.22]Cool, alright, that was don't scream.
[283:37.14]It's on steam.
[283:39.02]And that was a good one.
[283:41.84]Alright, coming up next.
[283:46.38]I want to try this one.
[283:47.08]This is called crowded followed.
[283:51.56]Crowded followed.
[283:55.94]Also on Steam.
[284:13.85]The guy breathing behind you in the bunker was genuinely terrifying.
[284:18.64]What is going on?
[284:22.26]Yeah, a lot of those I thought we're going to turn it into jump scares.
[284:28.46]Hey, if the urinals both left and right of the middle one are taken, do you just use the middle urinal or do you wait for someone to leave?
[284:36.92]Uh, I all, here's what I do.
[284:40.31]I walk in the bathroom and if, if, if there's only the spot you're talking about, uh, I will wash my hands and pretend that's why I went into the bathroom in the first place.
[284:52.89]And then I will go back in 10 to 25 seconds later.
[284:57.50]Or if there's, if the stall is open, uh, you know, if the stall is there and you wash your hands, you kind of, oh yeah, this is why I came.
[285:03.96]And you, you go like this, man, this is,
[285:06.89]Something on there.
[285:08.03]Can't get that off.
[285:09.57]Yeah, I got something on.
[285:10.25]I got something on there.
[285:12.41]And then somebody comes up next to the sink.
[285:14.18]Like, ah, he must have got something on his hand.
[285:17.84]Yeah, I just got it.
[285:19.16]So I got to wash my hands.
[285:21.20]And then you come back in like 10, 20, 30 seconds later.
[285:22.80]Alright, crowded followed.
[285:29.35]Let's do settings here.
[285:30.95]Turn that way down.
[285:41.50]I think we keep everything besides motion blur.
[285:47.49]Audio good.
[285:48.31]Maybe a tad loud.
[285:54.85]I mean, the scary games are going to be loud.
[285:56.41]That's the way it is, right?
[286:05.05]Turn on jump scare mode?
[286:08.77]What?
[286:09.10]What are you talking about?
[286:19.75]Uh, probably gonna be loud, but whatever, we're good.
[286:21.23]Alright, crowded follow, let's do it.
[286:23.09]Choose chapter.
[286:23.93]Uh, I guess it's a new game, right?
[286:28.88]Alright, what difficulty do I want to do here?
[286:30.36]Hope you're good at something at least.
[286:32.32]Less stamina usage, able to make more distance.
[286:35.59]Are you ready?
[286:36.17]Normal stamina, core experience.
[286:39.71]Then there's just these ones.
[286:42.49]We're just doing normal.
[286:43.37]I'm just doing normal, Andy.
[286:46.73]Did you change your shirt?
[286:47.71]No, it's the same shirt I've had on.
[286:58.05]WASD mouse E shift and Q or right trigger, OK?
[287:09.09]Full letter grade for saying the title in a scoring voice.
[287:11.05]Can we please get that out on the record please?
[287:16.71]You didn't wait.
[287:21.79]I need to turn the.
[287:25.71]Yeah, this is gonna come way down.
[287:29.30]E to interact, pick up items.
[287:34.02]Still a little too high.
[287:42.17]That's better.
[287:43.71]Alright, maybe one more notch.
[287:46.95]Yeah.
[287:49.65]My bill.

[288:55.53]Pretty good, all things considered.
[288:59.37]Gets tiring sitting all day asking Strange for change.
[289:03.43]Not much, but keep me going for now.
[289:09.84]Not enough to help.
[289:10.52]It's getting cold.
[289:16.54]I'll figure something out.
[289:18.06]I always do.
[289:20.41]Get closer to that can fire and warm myself.
[289:22.71]That'll help.
[289:30.55]Ah, okay.
[289:31.17]That's much better.
[289:34.30]I should find something to eat.
[289:37.32]What the hell was that?
[289:38.12]Another shooting?
[289:41.46]Might have some money on him.
[289:42.76]The city is getting out of hand.

[297:36.85]Oh my god!
[298:27.99]Okay, am I right?
[298:29.89]Alright, I almost got it, I almost got it.
[298:43.38]Oh, oh, oh!
[298:55.43]I don't know!
[299:04.51]Oh, fuck it.
[299:06.23]I like bones hurt.
[299:07.27]I don't want to get trapped in there.
[299:21.98]Get out of my fucking way, you fucking little shit.
[299:39.10]I already looked under here.
[299:39.92]I already looked under there.
[300:04.41]OH SHIT!
[300:06.31]OH!
[300:08.51]Get out of my way.
[300:12.51]Fuck off.
[300:19.25]Almost there.
[300:27.40]These are YouTuber reactions.
[300:28.84]Yeah, it's fine.
[300:29.42]I don't care.
[300:30.36]This is terrifying.
[300:31.08]This is awful.
[300:48.55]I need 320.
[300:49.09]Nine more cents?
[301:02.84]Right here, come on.
[301:07.16]Got it.
[301:07.91]Subway exit.
[301:08.49]Let's get out.
[301:15.29]Where's the exit?
[301:16.97]I have no idea.
[301:31.57]Where's the exit?
[301:43.90]Up that way.
[301:46.78]Pick us up.
[301:57.13]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[302:03.05]Exit exit right there.
[302:09.52]Oh.
[302:12.02]Guys, I'm not gonna lie.
[302:12.80]This is the worst one all night.
[302:17.68]Fuck that was close.
[302:19.93]This is by far the worst one.
[302:25.29]So much anxiety on this one.
[302:29.73]Shoulder aches with the weight of the case.
[302:33.72]It's mine!
[302:34.32]Okay, I'm not gonna pawn this off to someone else.
[302:38.68]It's a death sentence.
[302:42.54]I better get going before that fairy takes off without me.
[302:46.42]Are we still going?
[302:57.06]God!
[303:17.45]OK, get on the ferry.
[303:21.25]Shake this up.
[303:28.83]Sounds crazy over there.
[303:31.91]It's about time people did something.
[303:33.59]I gotta keep moving though.
[303:42.78]Pre-shake this.
[303:59.36]Smells good.
[303:59.98]We get some calm here.
[304:05.23]Oh my goodness, thank God.
[304:29.18]How's it going?
[304:32.44]Fine night for it, isn't it?
[304:35.80]You have to help me.
[304:37.32]Please.
[304:38.85]What's ailing you?
[304:40.23]They look over your shoulder.
[304:42.59]Police aren't after you, are they?
[304:45.33]No, it's a creature.
[304:46.17]A shapeshifter.
[304:49.07]You should stay off it, friend.
[304:51.01]Whatever your poison.
[304:51.97]Maybe you're right.
[305:00.06]Take it you're one for the streets as well.
[305:02.88]Can spot it a mile off.
[305:05.14]What's your story?
[305:05.78]Folks like us can go weeks without a real conversation.
[305:09.24]Happy to listen.
[305:12.56]Start up with medical bills.
[305:14.07]Yeah, you know the story.
[305:16.17]It's getting more and more common.
[305:17.75]Why do you think people are taking to the streets?
[305:21.37]Social contract, buddy.
[305:22.29]It's breaking down.
[305:24.28]I've traded the concrete for sand.
[305:26.40]Couldn't be happier.
[305:27.10]More than enough room here, I say.
[305:29.16]Hate to ask, but I don't suppose you have any chance I could... How many change I could borrow?
[305:33.00]Uh, I think I have a little bit left.
[305:39.67]Should have, like, at least some sense left.
[305:41.47]Whatever you're doing with that case, look after yourself.
[305:50.46]I'm not doing good right now.
[305:54.20]Where's the ferry?
[305:58.50]I got an ad break coming up.
[305:59.74]This is the probably the last ad break in the night.
[306:04.45]It's about 11 o'clock Pacific.
[306:07.93]Getting there.
[306:10.81]Getting pretty late.
[306:19.24]This in VR would go insane.
[306:21.06]Oh man, I don't know.
[306:22.08]Yeah, I don't think I could do that.
[306:34.04]This one's great though.
[306:35.70]This has been probably by far the scariest of all of them.
[306:39.89]I'm getting some genuine terror from this one.
[306:47.77]Club poster?
[306:50.04]Club Metro.
[307:00.98]Let's get topped off.
[307:02.76]I think we're going to the club.
[307:12.57]Cut the line.
[307:36.97]No chance of getting to the docks through here.
[307:38.96]Looks like police if the street locked down.
[307:42.18]Gotta find another way around.
[307:45.91]We're going through the club for sure.
[308:11.24]Alright, this is charged up.
[308:15.44]Shit.
[308:16.44]Dead end.
[308:17.52]Suppose I'll head back and try another.
[308:18.88]Find anything.
[308:26.57]Into the club we go.
[308:27.71]Christ.
[308:40.94]You don't know!
[308:41.52]You don't know the danger!
[308:42.54]I gotta get a band for every floor.
[308:44.82]Ah, I got a delivery.
[309:05.00]No sweat, though.
[309:05.94]Afraid you're locked in for now.
[309:06.98]Police are setting up cordons.
[309:09.46]You're going to have to wait it out with the rest of us.
[309:12.14]Guess you're part of the party now.
[309:14.92]Got any VIP bands left?
[309:16.26]Want to meet the DJ?
[309:20.22]All out, though.
[309:20.74]I'm sure some fool's misplaced theirs if you look about.
[309:25.89]Thanks.
[309:27.71]Buildings locked down now.
[309:28.75]Till the madness clears up.
[309:29.67]There's a fire escape up top.
[309:30.73]Try there if you find any wristbands and need some air.
[309:35.03]What a night to be fucking alive.
[309:46.19]Let's go.
[309:46.63]Need a wristband.
[309:59.76]Floor one.
[310:03.82]First floor pass.
[310:26.58]Are we gonna pass?
[310:32.06]Are we gonna pass?
[310:33.74]Oh my god, okay.
[310:49.24]I got one break here.
[310:51.18]I'm gonna... I'm kind of hungry.
[310:52.84]I might get a little snack.
[310:56.92]Uh, ads are gonna play in like a minute and a half.
[310:59.38]Uh, I'll be back in like four minutes.
[311:03.26]Last break of the night.
[311:04.52]I'll see you guys in a few.
[311:06.41]I'm gonna grab a snack.
[311:09.97]And I'll probably try this a few more times.
[311:13.53]And then maybe end the stream there.
[311:15.47]We'll see.
[311:23.31]to go all the way back uh I'm gonna have to get the pass again but no I gotta there are at least 15 more games that we have not seen so we'll do this again don't worry
[311:51.65]I do want to try this a few more times, though, so I'll be back.
[311:54.78]Ads will start in about two minutes.
[311:56.18]No, no, no.
[311:56.56]In like one minute, actually.
[311:57.52]I'll be right back.
[311:59.98]See you guys in a few minutes.
[316:42.42]Got about 20 seconds left on the ads.
[316:46.28]I cannot tell you how generationally happy I was when I opened up the freezer.
[316:52.32]I saw that there was a Trader Joe's Tikka Masala in there.
[316:56.56]Oh, I can't wait to eat that.
[317:11.33]There's one in there.
[317:18.51]Gotta wash it down with an ice cold bush.
[317:28.72]I have not seen the Minecraft movie, no.
[317:35.50]And I'm going to wait till it's on DVD, so no, I'm not going to be seeing it anytime soon.
[317:52.24]Alright, welcome back.
[317:54.60]We'll do this maybe a few more times.
[317:59.51]I will do a solid attempt to get through the club.
[318:01.95]How's the lighting?
[318:07.33]Is the lighting good?
[318:07.97]Seems like it's pretty good.
[318:09.91]It's been going all night too, this off-lamp.
[318:17.32]How's the hair?
[318:19.69]I recently got a haircut.
[318:21.71]Does it look alright?
[318:25.09]I think it looks pretty good.
[318:30.33]Maybe a little bulky back here, but it's all good.
[318:33.60]It is hot in here.
[318:42.64]Alright, let's cheers one more time.
[318:47.85]It's very late.
[318:49.67]I'm saying cheers to you and you probably went to sleep three hours ago.
[318:52.93]Let's try this again.
[319:20.20]Where was that first band?
[319:27.98]Why did I just take the phone?
[319:32.07]Oh!
[319:33.09]Oh no.
[319:33.99]Okay.
[319:39.97]It was on the bar.
[319:46.18]It's right behind me.
[319:48.81]Is it dynamic?
[319:49.77]Does it change every time?
[319:59.30]Oh, you motherfucker!
[320:02.80]Move!
[320:16.96]Where is it?
[320:20.63]It was on the bar last time.
[320:21.91]Is it not there?
[320:30.51]Come on, come on, come on.
[320:31.49]It's right here.
[320:31.91]No!
[320:50.89]Bad start.
[320:52.09]Bad start.
[320:53.05]Bad start.
[320:54.65]It's okay.
[320:55.11]Bad start.
[320:56.15]I think it changes every time.
[321:06.51]Okay.
[321:09.89]Let's try this again.
[321:12.65]Get it fully shaken.
[321:13.71]Can I go in here?
[321:18.57]I need manager's keys.
[321:25.83]Alright.
[321:26.51]Where would it be?
[321:27.31]Okay.
[321:29.41]It didn't spawn here again.
[321:30.75]I'll try the bathroom.
[321:54.97]Come on, where is it?
[321:56.33]There it is.
[321:56.73]Alright, floor, let's go to the... First floor?
[322:04.36]Let's go.
[322:26.07]On the ground?
[322:26.55]Nope.
[322:26.75]Oh shit, it's in somebody's pocket.
[322:37.48]Second floor.
[322:51.35]Oh my god.
[322:52.27]Alright, second floor, go.
[323:02.49]Oh, this game sucks.
[323:12.24]Manager's office straight up a VIP pass.
[323:16.17]I go back downstairs.
[323:23.65]Come on, shake it, shake it, shake it.
[323:24.94]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[323:29.56]I can't tell.
[323:30.33]I can't tell where it is.
[323:32.25]I'm in so much trouble now.
[323:33.55]Oh my god damn it.
[323:35.13]I'm alive.
[323:35.61]I'm alive.

[323:40.62]Alright.
[323:40.82]I'm just going to run.
[324:01.05]I hate games where something just chases you.
[324:04.89]It just fills me with anxiety.
[324:06.67]I just can't do it.
[324:07.35]I just wish I had a shovel or a wrench or a shotgun or something.
[324:15.26]And this inhaler mechanic.
[324:19.47]Ah, it sucks.
[324:27.88]If you turn around and look, she kind of jump scares you a little.
[324:31.30]Alright.
[324:37.47]Coats.
[324:39.97]Shit.
[324:40.33]I hate this.

[328:47.06]There it is.
[329:03.26]the coat room.
[329:04.60]I didn't want to go in the coat room.
[329:05.84]I didn't want to go in the coat room.
[329:11.38]She's right behind me.
[329:18.94]She's right up my ass.
[329:23.53]She's right up my ass.
[329:25.21]The music is still changed.
[329:30.35]She is right up my ass!
[329:41.94]Was that a person?
[329:42.64]I thought it was a monster.
[329:45.42]Get out of the fucking way!

[330:16.27]Where is it?
[330:16.61]What is that?
[330:17.79]I got the fire escape?
[330:30.77]I didn't know if she was going to go to the right or to the left.
[330:33.09]Fuck, this one sucks.
[330:37.37]Okay.
[330:39.81]Close.
[330:40.43]Alright.
[330:43.57]See you later.
[330:46.05]That's the end of this one.
[330:48.77]Ugh.
[330:51.35]I got too close.
[330:56.29]Alright, final last one.
[330:57.61]For real.
[331:01.97]Where is the fire escape?
[331:03.15]Is it right here somewhere?
[331:04.17]Because I'm going to do that and I'm going to mess it up.
[331:06.99]Alright, last one for real.
[331:09.50]Let's go.
[331:12.16]It's probably all the way upstairs.
[331:13.44]Dude, you're going to have the shits later?
[331:34.40]first one.
[331:36.78]Getting back down is not the problem.
[331:38.18]It's just getting... Ugh.
[331:44.09]The thing that follows you game.
[331:54.46]Ugh, shit.
[331:55.14]It's not in this one.
[331:59.60]Stop doing that!
[332:02.60]You can't get me through the coat racks.
[332:04.18]You can't get me through the coat racks.
[332:05.16]That is a sanctuary.
[332:07.14]You can't get me through the coat rack.
[332:12.65]You gotta play by the same rules.
[332:20.39]I'm gonna farm this for a second.
[332:27.80]I'm gonna farm this for a second.
[332:28.64]I need to get full health.
[332:53.85]That was bad
[333:15.63]That sounded like a soundboard.
[333:18.41]You know that scream that's... Oh, you know the one.
[333:20.67]It's over.
[333:21.21]The one that goes like... Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[333:39.62]That was Crowded Followed.
[333:43.00]And it's about midnight.
[333:44.80]It's time to call it a night.
[333:50.58]Hope you had fun.
[333:51.94]I had a lot of fun.
[333:52.44]There's some really good ones in this little smorgasbord.
[333:56.96]Tomorrow, we'll be playing Marvel Rivals.
[333:59.38]I'm going to do a sponsored Marvel Rivals segment.
[334:03.24]It's only for two hours, so it'll be part of a larger stream.
[334:10.68]Heart.
[334:13.33]I want to play Chrono Trigger tomorrow.
[334:15.07]We will.
[334:17.41]We will play Chrono Trigger tomorrow.
[334:20.65]So don't worry.
[334:20.99]You're going to have a heart attack?
[334:24.37]No, I'm fine.
[334:25.09]Don't worry.
[334:28.05]Thanks for watching.
[334:29.27]Thanks for hanging out.
[334:32.22]Appreciate everybody hanging out for the night.
[334:39.88]Starting probably around 2, maybe like 1.30 tomorrow.
[334:48.57]1.30 p.m.
[334:50.07]We'll do Marvel Rivals for a couple hours.
[334:53.53]And after Marvel Rivals, we'll see.
[335:00.95]I got a tikka masala with my name on it.
[335:03.92]Getting ready to go.
[335:15.34]There were a lot of subs tonight.
[335:18.92]It's like 13 pages long.
[335:20.24]Thanks, guys.
[335:35.25]I don't know when we will do another scary game night, but you can always assume it'll be on probably a Saturday.
[335:42.23]Whatever, though.
[335:42.88]We'll see.
[335:44.77]I got a lot of other ones to play.
[335:46.02]I got a whole huge list.
[336:02.60]Scare Saturdays are back.
[336:06.69]Not every Saturday.
[336:10.13]They will happen on a Saturday.
[336:13.76]I, you don't, who knows when that will be though.
[336:18.93]Yeah, if you also, if there's any other scary, let's call them 30, 25 to 35 minute experiences, definitely throw them in the recommended channel on the Discord.
[336:31.27]Discord is, I know these days is pretty slow and it's pretty locked down, but those channels are still open.
[336:37.94]So if you got something you think is cool, throw it in there.
[336:49.27]And that's it.
[336:50.21]See you guys tomorrow around 1.30 p.m.
[336:51.55]Take care of yourselves.
[336:57.58]Call your mother.
[336:58.92]Get some sleep.
[336:59.56]It's late.
[337:01.62]See you tomorrow.
[337:41.94]you
[338:16.75]Thank you.
