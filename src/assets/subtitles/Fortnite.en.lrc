[03:44.43]Okay.
[03:44.71]So what am I looking for?

[03:52.70]This is bad.
[03:55.44]You might be in a queue.
[03:58.28]No, just in a party.
[04:00.08]No, no, no.
[04:00.44]I mean like in a queue to be on my pending friends list.
[04:03.09]Sure, right.
[04:05.35]Oh, no.
[04:06.33]Can I turn this off?
[04:08.19]Turn it off now, yeah.
[04:10.07]And then you can filter through the dregs of humanity.
[04:14.40]Oh, God damn it.
[04:16.33]Alright.
[04:16.61]You also could just send me one.
[04:18.22]I could just send it.
[04:18.80]Yeah, that's going to be easier.
[04:19.88]Bahama Papa, yeah.
[04:21.38]Bahama Papa.
[04:23.15]One word.
[04:23.49]Bahama Papa.
[04:25.49]Okay.
[04:31.52]I was just taking up my whole fucking screen.
[04:35.44]The UI is inexperienced.
[04:38.20]I was gonna say, what is this, like a hundred billion dollar company, this UI?
[04:41.70]Hold on, don't get mad.
[04:42.62]It's like Netscape.
[04:43.62]No, you're right, you're right.
[04:44.56]Control, control the emotions.
[04:46.62]Okay, I'm gonna keep it under control.
[04:49.65]Okay.
[04:52.51]Wish I should have just said this in silence.
[04:54.99]Are you trying to type in Dvorak, dude?
[04:56.29]What's going on?
[04:57.51]Okay, how do I add a player?
[05:00.75]Okay, go to the friends list in the top left.
[05:02.39]Uh-huh.
[05:03.11]And then the second one, the second tab on the left side of the screen.
[05:05.68]It's a plus button.
[05:06.80]Click that, then find player by display name.
[05:08.88]Yeah, that's what I just did.
[05:10.58]Wait, did you send it to me?
[05:12.18]Bahama Papa, right?
[05:13.36]Did you make a space or no?
[05:14.52]No, it's there.
[05:15.86]Oh, I got it.
[05:16.32]Alright.
[05:18.33]I'm so sorry.
[05:20.53]I fucked this whole thing up.
[05:21.65]You're fine.
[05:22.55]No, you're the best.
[05:24.77]Alright, now I'm going to turn this off.
[05:26.11]I can turn off the friend notifications, right?
[05:28.05]I'm getting so many, god damn it.
[05:29.93]Dude, I'm sorry.
[05:31.20]No, it's not your fault.
[05:32.44]I've ruined everything.
[05:34.46]Nope, everything's fine.
[05:35.84]This is the cost of a victory royale.
[05:38.58]You are the president and we are your chaperones.
[05:40.72]I want you to realize that.
[05:42.25]So let me, let me turn you guys all up.
[05:43.63]First of all, hi.
[05:44.33]Sorry, like, hi guys.
[05:46.45]How's it going?
[05:47.63]Let me turn everybody up.
[05:48.33]So real quick, make things easy.
[05:49.57]So, uh, final case is my buddy Alec.
[05:51.51]What's up, man?
[05:52.75]One of the best, one of the best Snipe players.
[05:54.01]Uh, I, Nick, we've met.
[05:56.08]Slime, you guys have met as well.
[05:57.56]Just in case.
[05:58.56]Yep.
[06:01.30]Okay.
[06:01.72]And so now, now you're added.
[06:03.76]So now in the general chat, Jerma, you need to say, Captain Jerma, co-captain Slime.
[06:09.24]Do I, how do I get a skin?
[06:11.44]Okay.
[06:12.04]So you're going to have to... Priorities.
[06:13.46]Priorities.
[06:14.12]No, no.
[06:14.42]This is good.
[06:15.26]No, no, no.
[06:15.80]I'll stay as default.
[06:16.32]Turn that off.
[06:17.27]Credit card information goes in.
[06:18.55]V-Bucks come out.
[06:19.61]How do I type in chat?
[06:21.51]The general chat in Discord.
[06:23.27]Oh.
[06:23.37]Okay.
[06:25.00]Yeah, if you buy a Balenciaga skin, you'll match us.
[06:27.72]But I want you to express yourself however you feel.
[06:29.74]I'm just going to stay like this.
[06:33.05]I'm just going to stay like this.
[06:35.03]That's too much work.
[06:36.13]I feel like we're about to start in 10 seconds.
[06:38.13]You can get TikTok dances in the game as well if that changes your mind.
[06:41.71]Yeah.
[06:42.57]Here, check this out.
[06:43.25]Hold on.
[06:43.57]Let me go into the general.
[06:44.93]Is it the general text channel?
[06:47.40]General text channel in Discord, yeah.
[06:50.46]You'll see my most recent messages.
[06:52.28]We are troubleshooting.
[06:54.45]Okay, so I'm going to say Slime is co-captain.
[06:59.59]Right?
[07:00.61]Yes.
[07:01.41]Hello, Jerma in squad.
[07:03.08]Hi, sorry.
[07:04.90]Everything's under control.
[07:06.50]Slime is your co-captain.
[07:08.04]Slime is your co-captain.
[07:08.92]Nick, heads or tails, call it in the air.
[07:11.02]Tails.
[07:11.34]Never fails.
[07:12.38]Alright.
[07:12.68]Tails never fails.
[07:13.50]Let's see if you're right.
[07:14.34]It never failed.
[07:15.28]FineOK is leaving.
[07:17.20]No.
[07:18.18]Wow.
[07:18.52]Oh, no.
[07:19.60]You're going with PayMoneyWubby.
[07:21.80]Oh, that's a great squad.
[07:22.50]You're going to actually have a lot of fun.
[07:24.00]Okay.
[07:24.18]Alright.
[07:24.48]Alright.
[07:25.04]Next squad.
[07:25.52]Next squad.
[07:26.74]Who's coming to our squad?
[07:29.48]I guess we'll find out.
[07:30.02]Who do we get?
[07:31.18]Wait, which one is that, Nick?
[07:32.48]Pay Money Wubby?
[07:34.24]Yeah, so it's placed.
[07:35.62]His name in here is probably just Wubby.
[07:37.48]It's the 13th.
[07:38.22]Yeah, there's a number.
[07:39.98]Okay.
[07:40.62]I'm so sorry.
[07:41.50]Have I just gone forever?
[07:43.46]I think you move every time.
[07:48.70]Okay, maybe.
[07:50.04]I don't know.
[07:50.52]But either way, this is you guys asked me where the vape pen is.
[07:53.63]I was actually going to get one but I didn't want to get like addicted to nicotine for a joke.
[07:57.81]I was like last second I was gonna go to the gas station and get one.
[08:05.30]So what were the rules again, there was some very specific rules we had to follow, right?
[08:09.87]Okay, one is no tanks.
[08:11.87]So there's tanks you can get inside of and drive around.
[08:14.11]Those are banned, and it's honor system.
[08:15.84]You just can't get in them.
[08:17.62]There are battle buses that are very chunky and big.
[08:20.08]You can get in those, but tanks are... And then the other rule is no using tents, which you don't have to worry about, but it's a way to transport good weapons across games.
[08:31.62]So, like, you can go into a tent that you find, a weapon that you've stored, you know, in the tent, which is like this universal bookshelf, and pull it out.
[08:39.88]But you can't do that.
[08:40.98]So, it doesn't really apply to us because we're honorable fighters.
[08:44.18]Sapnap, hello.
[08:45.10]Hi, guys.
[08:45.64]I'm on the team now.
[08:47.09]What's up?
[08:47.71]It's a pleasure to have you.
[08:48.69]We are the best team here.
[08:50.51]That's true.
[08:51.80]alright we're gonna win I've got some pretty good FPS uh background I'm not concerned about it that's and that's what I've been saying to all the haters the fakes
[09:03.67]Yeah, I got some.
[09:05.43]I can do it.
[09:06.39]We got to kick Final K out forever, Nick.
[09:10.39]Oh, yeah.
[09:11.01]You're right.
[09:11.80]I need to add one of you guys.
[09:14.72]This is true.
[09:15.80]You can add Bahama Papa.
[09:17.56]It's one word.
[09:19.18]Hold on.
[09:20.88]Let me open my friends list for a moment.
[09:22.40]Okay.
[09:22.70]I don't know how to spell Bahama or Papa.
[09:24.74]One of the two.
[09:25.26]I don't know which one.
[09:26.80]Pretty phonetic.
[09:27.64]It's B-A-H-A-M-A-P-A-P-A.
[09:31.05]That's what I put, searching for users.
[09:32.65]Okay.
[09:33.97]Got it.
[09:35.17]Are you a real HOC?
[09:36.43]No, I'm pandas.
[09:37.68]I just sent you a friend request.
[09:39.32]Okay, hold on.
[09:40.10]I gotta fucking... There you go.
[09:42.34]Got it.
[09:43.50]Awesome.
[09:44.02]I think we got a pretty good squad.
[09:45.62]I'm getting so many friend requests, and they're all from people with FaZe in their name.
[09:51.54]Trying to buy some NFTs, bro?
[09:53.12]Alright.
[09:56.96]Fortnite Andy?
[09:58.74]There's like 100 people in this tournament.
[10:00.58]We're all Fortnite Andys today.
[10:02.65]True.
[10:04.09]So we're playing against everybody at the same time right now?
[10:07.15]Yeah, we're going to drop from a bus in the sky and then it's kill everyone you see except for us.
[10:13.96]Okay.
[10:14.56]Is it friendly fire?
[10:16.06]No.
[10:16.58]No.
[10:17.90]We should try and land on one of the blimps.
[10:20.96]I'm down.
[10:21.82]Because once you take over the blimp,
[10:23.97]It's a really good high ground.
[10:25.37]People rarely come up to fight you, and if you do, you have high ground.
[10:28.55]Yeah, I like that.
[10:29.83]Sapnap, for context, Jerma has not ever played Fortnite, which shouldn't be a problem.
[10:35.15]It shouldn't.
[10:36.03]No, we got it.
[10:36.45]But I believe there should be a sort of get-down-Mr-President strategy employed.
[10:42.48]I mean, I did make it really clear that I have no experience.
[10:48.91]Like I said, shit's our problem.
[10:50.39]Dude, I'm gonna get a bow and arrow that's gonna hit me in the fucking temple when we start.
[10:54.39]Yes sir, you made it clear, yes sir.
[10:56.21]We're gonna land and I'm gonna get like a bow and arrow through my neck and I'm just gonna be dead.
[11:00.33]And I'm gonna pull it out and I'm gonna weep, okay?
[11:05.41]Because this is war.
[11:08.45]Well, we got this.
[11:09.31]I'm actually excited.
[11:10.13]We're a good squad.
[11:13.50]We should drive Jerma in the back of a car.
[11:17.88]Can I just fire out of a window or something?
[11:20.73]You can.
[11:21.47]It's a lot like GTA.
[11:22.67]You crack the window.
[11:24.41]I think you're our party leader, Nick, so you should do the honors.
[11:27.99]Is the code dropped?
[11:29.55]The code should be dropped.
[11:31.27]Not yet.
[11:32.39]JK Ludwig changing teams.
[11:33.55]Okay, we're good.
[11:34.19]I thought we were in trouble.
[11:35.63]I feel so bad.
[11:37.19]The fourth player on our team with a really, really old friend of mine who doesn't know anyone here.
[11:42.32]We needed a fourth, so I grabbed him.
[11:43.80]And then Ludwig did this switch thing.
[11:47.02]He got sent away.
[11:48.72]Got sent to war.
[11:49.64]Oh, no.
[11:50.10]He got put on one of these.
[11:53.53]What team were you on, Sapnap?
[11:55.11]I was on Connor's team.
[11:58.77]You play Minecraft, right?
[12:00.13]Yeah.
[12:00.69]Okay.
[12:01.97]That's good for us.
[12:02.85]We have building experience here.
[12:03.71]That is huge for us.
[12:04.69]Wait, I thought about that.
[12:05.47]There's a building?
[12:06.87]No, no.
[12:07.77]Building's off, but it's going to come with ancient knowledge that only he could have.
[12:11.53]Oh, thank God.
[12:12.23]I was about to be very sad.
[12:16.98]Dude, do not say JFK985 in this chat.
[12:24.31]Oh, man.
[12:29.13]So, how do I toggle aim?
[12:32.99]Right click.
[12:34.16]Oh, I see.
[12:34.96]I see.
[12:35.28]ADS.
[12:37.06]I like to toggle.
[12:37.74]I don't like to hold.
[12:39.37]Oh, you want to change it?
[12:40.47]I see.
[12:41.09]Okay.
[12:41.61]So you're going to go to your settings.
[12:43.74]You're going to click the arrow keys on the third to last.
[12:51.74]Let's see.
[12:52.82]There's target, but there's no target toggle.
[12:57.31]Oh, man.
[12:57.83]Maybe you're right.
[12:58.75]Maybe you can't do that.
[12:59.71]Can you really not?
[13:00.61]Am I the only person that cares about that?
[13:03.51]You're not.
[13:04.41]No, you are not.
[13:05.65]I don't, but you are not the only person.
[13:08.33]You are weird and different, but we accept you here.
[13:11.19]I made a script to do toggle in that Revenant game.
[13:16.89]I found it.
[13:17.83]It's the gear icon on the top in the second menu.
[13:21.65]It's toggle targeting in combat section.
[13:24.37]Oh, you're right.
[13:27.57]So you scroll down to combat in the gear icon in your settings menu.
[13:32.61]And just toggle targeting on.
[13:35.58]Oh, hell yeah.
[13:36.42]And so you are seen and valid in the eyes of Fortnite.
[13:39.57]Yeah, that's cool.
[13:41.45]I'm happy about it.
[13:42.85]I don't want to show, like, if someone's going to see something, they're going to steal me.
[13:49.07]Sapnap, do you have a Balenciaga skin?
[13:53.03]Yeah, I do.
[13:55.87]I can run it.
[13:56.91]I mean, that would be huge because it would be like we're the three Balenciaga secret agents and then we have Jermo.
[14:03.87]Can I change?
[14:05.33]Is there like a default like skins I can choose from?
[14:07.53]Yeah, there are, I think.
[14:10.05]How do I do that?
[14:12.05]I think, no, I don't think there's any broke talk in this game.
[14:14.95]I'm not kidding.
[14:15.91]I don't think there's, you can't.
[14:17.87]Oh, you just randomized?
[14:20.85]I mean, I just downloaded the game like an hour ago.
[14:27.06]Well, I bought a dog with a Balenciaga hoodie, so... We're just different.
[14:32.64]I have so many TikTok dances.
[14:33.68]Oh, we can gift him.
[14:34.96]Oh, I'll gift you, dude.
[14:36.40]Can you gift me Spider-Man?
[14:38.37]Uh, if Spider-Man's in the shop, I can do it.
[14:40.27]You just said that with, like, so much hope.
[14:43.05]I don't see Spider-Man.
[14:44.15]I see someone named Big Chuggus.
[14:46.39]Whoa!
[14:47.05]Wait, there's a Big Chuggus skin?
[14:48.23]Spider-Man was Battle Pass from last, uh, last... What's it called?
[14:52.23]There's Matrix stuff?
[14:53.81]Yeah, there's a Metro.
[14:56.64]I don't want Doctor Strange.
[14:57.56]That means I bought it right now.
[14:58.66]I don't want anyone to know that.
[14:59.94]That's true.
[15:00.32]That is loser behavior.
[15:02.10]Okay, buy as a gift.
[15:03.97]Enable 2FA, brother.
[15:07.25]Okay, hold on.
[15:07.81]I think I can do this.
[15:09.78]it's opening a different I cannot alright let me tell you right now do not like risk putting your phone number into uh into like the screen to the internet to give me the spider-man skin I think I will I think we're okay with this do you have spider-man in your thing I don't I don't spider-man I had him but that was like a week ago wait spider-man's in your shop
[15:34.89]yeah he was in like the the bottom of the shop or maybe somebody said uh thought watchers skip I don't think you want to skip this and by the way this is not the only thing I'm doing today I got a very big plans today I got every boss in every from souls game tier list that I'm going to take a lot of time on and it's ready to go that's happening after this
[16:00.36]I think, I think dude, there, there's a splash screen when I loaded a game earlier and it said only you can prevent V buck like stealing and says, don't share your account info.
[16:09.47]And there's like a cat pointing at the screen.
[16:11.93]Awesome.
[16:13.75]I was like, damn, they, they, this is, this is the, this is the good message.
[16:17.34]Everybody's freaking out saying that I should turn on the streamer mode because of the DMCA music.
[16:21.72]Oh, yeah.
[16:22.34]Yes.
[16:22.84]There's Doja Cat.
[16:24.36]There's real music in the car when you get in.
[16:26.48]Unless you want to get fucking crazy.
[16:28.36]I'm crazy.
[16:29.06]I feel like I just leave it on.
[16:30.64]I don't know.
[16:32.70]I'll be honest.
[16:33.16]Do I really care if the Fortnite section of this stream gets nuked?
[16:36.37]What are they going to do?
[16:37.11]Send the weekend?
[16:37.85]I am honestly... If this gets muted, this part of the stream, I don't really necessarily care.
[17:10.04]You also, like, can't cancel it.
[17:11.91]Okay, licensed audio mute all?
[17:15.85]Yeah.
[17:16.99]Why is it Gundam style?
[17:19.11]That's so good.
[17:20.07]There's a dance just so big 10 years ago, and they brought it back for Fortnite.
[17:27.71]There's no music replacements?
[17:28.91]You just kind of do that?
[17:31.05]I don't think there's... No, I don't think... Why do I feel like the whole game muted?
[17:36.95]Oh, we're good.
[17:43.60]No, it's good to see you guys again.
[17:45.86]We're good to hear from you again.
[17:47.78]Yes, sir.
[17:48.16]We were very excited to hear that you were our captain.
[17:51.40]I found out I was your captain when I came in the call.
[17:55.10]So I'm ready to leave this ship.
[17:59.04]Steer it in the right direction.
[18:00.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:02.78]A Ludwig Ogren production.
[18:04.68]Can I paint you a little picture of how we got here?
[18:08.18]So last Fortnite Monday, we had a son on our team.
[18:14.19]who has played a little more than you have, but has played probably just as significant amount as you have.
[18:20.71]And we got destroyed.
[18:21.91]We got second to last.
[18:24.12]Um, since then Ludwig, Nick, me and Hassan, since then we have put in some serious hours.
[18:30.99]We've been dropping tilted constantly.
[18:32.91]Okay.
[18:33.77]Uh, we've been discussing strategy.
[18:35.43]Um, we consulted our friend's little brother, uh, cuz he, that was huge.
[18:40.83]That was a good call.
[18:42.17]Cuz he's like 16.
[18:43.25]So we asked him how he would approach this.
[18:46.19]And I think we're ready to place top three.
[18:48.11]Okay.
[18:52.34]I mean, look, I might not know Fortnite, but you take the building out.
[18:56.40]I have like 3,000, 4,000 hours in Team Fortress 2.
[18:59.86]Yeah, you point and you shoot, you know?
[19:02.31]And I mean, like, I just completed Elden Ring.
[19:05.41]It's just a better cartoon shooter.
[19:06.57]You're going to be fine.
[19:08.45]Yeah, you got it.
[19:08.99]Everybody said congratulations.
[19:11.63]But it's alright.
[19:13.63]Oh, you're talking about... Yeah, that's super weird.
[19:16.07]I just said I just completed Elden Ring and I just figured that I was going to get a bunch of claps and stuff.
[19:20.76]No, yeah, I heard that.
[19:22.16]I heard that.
[19:25.12]So... Fortnite, so... Better or what?
[19:30.31]What are people spending better for?
[19:34.33]No one asked.
[19:38.65]Oh, code's up, code's up.
[19:40.83]Oh, oh, oh.
[19:41.99]Okay.
[19:42.83]Putting our code in.
[19:47.87]So should I ready up?
[19:51.23]Once I do, yeah.
[19:54.77]It's a pleasure to meet you, by the way.
[19:56.23]Alright.
[19:58.41]We should be able to ready.
[20:01.61]I have the code in.
[20:03.33]Oh, sorry.
[20:03.61]I was using the restroom.
[20:04.45]It's a pleasure to meet you as well.
[20:05.59]I had my wireless headset on.
[20:08.15]You were listening to this while you were in the restroom?
[20:10.03]Yeah.
[20:11.09]That's special.
[20:12.87]I just left my headset on, muted my mic, got up, and went to pee.
[20:16.85]That's a good idea, actually.
[20:17.99]And I heard, just in case I was going to miss something, is it time to ready up?
[20:22.75]I think so, yeah.
[20:23.66]I'm hitting it.
[20:25.28]Should we just do it?
[20:27.04]Yes, sir.
[20:28.56]Alright.
[20:29.54]Surprise for the table.
[20:30.50]I'm going to put both headphones in for this.
[20:37.67]Okay, Jerma, big thing for, I think, Battle Royales in general.
[20:42.37]The worst thing you can hear when something is happening to your teammate is, they're over there, because no one knows what you're talking about, right?
[20:49.27]So there's a ping button.
[20:50.31]I believe it's mapped to Z. Very helpful for saying, over there, and then it's like, beep, beep.
[20:55.27]You got it.
[20:57.98]Also, I do have some Battle Royale experience.
[21:03.26]Not with this game.
[21:04.16]Which one?
[21:05.14]PUBG Mobile.
[21:06.76]Okay.
[21:07.38]Wait.
[21:07.76]Mobile?
[21:09.43]That's not a joke.
[21:10.35]I actually, I played the mobile PUBG.
[21:11.97]A lot of airport hours.
[21:14.81]Were you nice, or?
[21:15.63]I mean, I was just in, I was just doing it in bed, just lying in bed.
[21:21.99]Oh, yeah, I think you need to ready up, Nick.
[21:23.83]I did what?
[21:24.35]Oh, what the hell?
[21:24.81]It says you're not ready.
[21:25.47]So, I understand the concept of the shrinking zone, of, like, the landing in different places, picking up weapons.
[21:29.49]Okay, what's a good weapon?
[21:30.39]What should I be looking for?
[21:32.63]I think the meta is, like, AUG, plus, um,
[21:36.62]What's the shotgun, the big amount of ammo?
[21:41.22]The drum one, I think?
[21:42.26]The drum, yeah.
[21:42.96]I think it's AUG plus drum plus the things that launch you and then two heals is what I was told.
[21:49.73]That's like the meta.
[21:53.44]There's SMGs.
[21:54.32]They're kind of unwieldy.
[21:56.18]Usually not worth it.
[21:57.96]But the rifles are like where your bread and butter is going to be.
[22:00.60]Are your mouths moving on your characters?
[22:02.44]No, they're not.
[22:03.02]Okay.
[22:03.46]Oh, yeah.
[22:03.96]The dog.
[22:04.49]Everyone keeps saying that.
[22:07.19]I was like, whoa, that's kind of cool.
[22:14.85]Are we supposed to switch to NA West?
[22:17.54]We are on NA West.
[22:19.32]Oh, okay.
[22:19.84]This ain't going to start in 30 minutes, right?
[22:24.16]It should start immediately or once everyone is ready.
[22:27.99]I think the 30 minute thing you're seeing is like a different thing.
[22:30.69]It's like the duo tournament.
[22:32.23]Oh, okay.
[22:33.13]Pop up.
[22:39.98]I feel like I'm going to surprise a lot of people.
[22:43.64]Why does it say only 28 cute?
[22:45.56]I didn't do it wrong, right?
[22:48.54]No, I think everyone's just waiting.
[22:50.50]No, I'm not going to buy a skin.
[22:54.24]No, it's too late.
[22:56.15]I'm just gonna play.
[22:58.43]Jerma, you might be cracked in this.
[22:59.75]I might be.
[23:00.93]This is a surprise to us.
[23:02.97]Yeah, I wasn't expecting that, but I mean, it's whatever.
[23:05.51]I'm ready to game.
[23:06.25]Ready to click heads?
[23:08.73]Oh, yeah.
[23:11.03]I love that attitude.
[23:13.77]So I know this healing, right?
[23:16.98]like bandages and that kind of thing.
[23:18.44]Yeah.
[23:18.90]Yeah.
[23:19.20]So big, big thing you want to remember if you, so there's little pots and small pots and they give you different amounts of shield.
[23:25.49]Uh, you're going to want to use those little pots first.
[23:27.85]Okay.
[23:28.43]The reason being is if you already have 50 shield and you try to take a little pot, the game doesn't let you.
[23:33.93]So you want to use the little pots to hit 50 and then use the big pot to hit a hundred.
[23:39.00]Yo, can one of you guys Discord live stream?
[23:43.53]uh yeah I probably should be me ty just one thank you hi ludwig a little late but uh the thought that counts I work on like 1500 millisecond ping so you get the internal delay yeah so it happens when you're almost 40.
[24:10.83]One day the Zoomers will be old, bro.
[24:13.61]Not me.
[24:13.97]That'll be funny.
[24:15.01]Not you?
[24:15.51]Nah, nah.
[24:16.97]I'm chillin'.
[24:19.32]I've been using lotion.
[24:21.90]I'm like all... Moisturized.
[24:24.48]I'm all slippery and hard to catch.
[24:27.24]No, no.
[24:27.56]Seriously, though.
[24:28.57]Actually moisturize your faces.
[24:30.07]Like, seriously do that.
[24:32.61]I was once told by a makeup professional doing makeup on my face for a thing.
[24:37.31]She said, if you moisturize, you will never age.
[24:39.93]And she said it with like this ancient wisdom.
[24:41.76]And I was like, yes.
[24:43.38]Okay.
[24:44.12]That's actually dead serious.
[24:45.56]Like when you come out of the shower, get like a really good light face moisturizer.
[24:49.52]That should be the first thing you do after you dry your face.
[24:52.02]Dry your face.
[24:52.66]Let it sit for a second.
[24:53.74]Moisturize.
[24:54.47]Trust me.
[24:57.87]I'm going to remember this forever.
[24:59.93]Your 40-year-old face is going to thank you.
[25:03.58]When you're fucking 40 and old and weird, you'll be looking smooth.
[25:07.86]Moist.
[25:10.34]I might be weird, but I'll be an otter.
[25:12.31]I'll be moving around.
[25:15.73]You should have a whole skincare routine.
[25:16.91]I don't know.
[25:18.05]We really should be pushing this.
[25:21.35]I think it's hard for dudes, you know?
[25:24.47]I wasn't caught this, you know, as a young man.
[25:26.97]I just ate Taco Bell and wore hoodies and rolled around in slop.
[25:33.21]Yeah, so that's not dude culture.
[25:35.45]I think you're trying to imply that.
[25:38.33]I wasn't doing that.
[25:40.32]Yeah, I know.
[25:40.96]It's just like the normal, like, American... Hey, Taco Bell and rolled around in slop.
[25:44.75]Yeah, it's just like what you did.
[25:46.53]Like, it's what I did.
[25:47.61]Culturally, I am literate.
[25:48.77]He's from Colorado.
[25:49.59]It's kind of like part of the whole... Yeah, that's what I think there.
[25:52.33]Colorado's nice.
[25:53.07]I like Colorado.
[25:54.51]Yeah, it's great slop.
[25:55.64]That's exactly what I was gonna say.
[26:08.39]People say I'm actually the American Psycho.
[26:11.71]No, I just like, I want to take care of my face.
[26:18.05]Is it psychotic to moisturize?
[26:19.95]Honestly, once this goes, it's over.
[26:22.43]Dude, you as a Patrick Bateman deepfake is so funny.
[26:26.74]I'm thinking about that right now.
[26:29.21]of my favorite moments I think it's like jackass one the movie uh it's like johnny Knoxville like he he he gets hit by like a claymore mine that has like rubber balls in it and they hit him all over his body his body's like insanely bruised and he's like kind of limping out after it happens and he's like circling his face he's like is this okay face good oh we're good right
[26:52.42]No, it's true.
[26:52.98]I mean, I used to be in the gym all the time.
[26:54.88]I used to work out all the time.
[26:56.32]Like, three or four days a week.
[26:58.16]And then, like, I started to kind of get, like, that weird, like, Attack on Titan monster body.
[27:04.12]Where, like, my stomach's, like, too big, but, like, my shoulders are not wide enough to make sense.
[27:09.50]And my, like, waist is small.
[27:11.00]My ass is huge.
[27:13.00]Yeah, you look like someone was just fucking around in the Tony Hawk building character.
[27:16.66]I mean, kind of.
[27:18.10]So, I mean, I got to make sure this stays around.
[27:23.68]And the hair, too.
[27:24.34]The hair's got to stick around for a while, too.
[27:25.62]I've got to be honest with you.
[27:27.20]Yeah, I started to look like the pill from Osmosis Jones.
[27:41.09]People are demanding I buy a skin.
[27:42.69]I don't... What's even available?
[27:44.23]You should buy a skin.
[27:45.49]I wasn't going to say that, but... Dude, I don't want to, like, go get my credit card.
[27:48.46]Someone else mentioned it.
[27:50.97]Yeah, get your money up, not your funny up.
[27:54.93]Yeah, that's pretty big.
[27:56.49]Do I have to put my credit card in?
[27:59.55]Well, it's not going to run on magic.
[28:00.97]This isn't UNICEF.
[28:02.71]Hold on.
[28:03.33]Let me turn all my... I don't want anyone to see the reflection of my eyes of my screen putting my credit card in.
[28:08.46]How much money do I need?
[28:11.51]uh how much what's the V-bug transfer like 20 30 100 bucks whatever 100 what no I put a hundred like 20 50 like you put a hundred dollars in 100 oh 100 the 7.99 one how about that one that's pretty good thank god I'm not showing this on screen right no yeah thousands enough for like like bubble gum or like maybe like
[28:37.88]of your shoes okay so add funds to wallet right place the order did it work thank you okay so I should have okay so now if I go to item shop I have a thousand I have one thousand V bucks
[28:55.09]Okay.
[28:56.29]It doesn't sound as much as it might be, but that will get you a skin.
[29:00.01]Alright, so what should I do?
[29:01.89]Well, now you can go to the item shop on the top and sort of browse and anything you can afford.
[29:06.83]Which is not much with a thousand.
[29:09.30]It is true.
[29:09.90]But I think you can get, I'm seeing Envoy, which is like a hot, like green-haired spy woman.
[29:18.74]You don't have enough for the fish in an astronaut suit.
[29:23.28]I don't have enough to do this.
[29:24.60]I have to buy the... I have to buy... Okay, what else is there?
[29:28.36]This is the only thing that's available.
[29:30.18]This is all that's available.
[29:31.38]It's Envoy or, I believe, Windwalker Echo, which is like a sort of like a mage.
[29:39.49]I don't know.
[29:40.45]Wind... It's uncommon.
[29:44.43]Green.
[29:45.89]Ah, okay.
[29:46.96]Windwalker Echo.
[29:48.76]Oh.
[29:52.81]I guess I'm going to do Envoy.
[29:56.29]What matches more with you guys?
[30:00.17]Envoy is very... is much more dripped out.
[30:03.70]Like, Wind Walker is like a fantasy character, right?
[30:06.16]We are dogs wearing Balenciaga, which has nothing to do with fantasy.
[30:08.94]Right.
[30:13.06]Alright, so I'm going to put another 1,000 V-Bucks in.
[30:14.70]My man.
[30:17.96]I should have just bought the other one.
[30:20.28]Wait, can you not get the...
[30:22.83]Am I missing something?
[30:25.13]How much is the dog?
[30:27.21]For me, it says 600, but maybe it's because I already... I don't know.
[30:32.28]I missed the 12% extra coins, too.
[30:34.08]For me, the dog says 1,200.
[30:35.14]Oh, okay.
[30:37.06]Maybe that just upgrades the dog.
[30:39.24]I think it's because... Okay, I see.
[30:40.54]It's like a... I see what's going on.
[30:43.21]It's because I own some of it.
[30:44.57]It's less.
[30:45.45]Yeah, I got the pack, so it doesn't even show me the price anymore.
[30:50.79]Okay.
[30:52.15]I got 2,000 V-Bucks.
[30:53.72]You want to put that skin on before the match starts, which is in like a minute.
[30:57.46]So you want to click Locker in the top?
[30:59.32]When you buy it.
[31:00.06]Oh, after you buy it.
[31:00.80]Big Chungus?
[31:05.37]That's what I was thinking is really your style.
[31:08.57]Cause he looks like the Attack on Titan guy.
[31:10.65]He looks like he has like guys screaming in his belly.
[31:13.66]That would look great on you.
[31:16.38]Fuck it up, Jerma.
[31:17.38]Wait, I think it's starting right now.
[31:20.18]You might be fucked.
[31:22.06]He's got it equipped.
[31:24.42]Did I do it?
[31:25.44]We're in.
[31:25.74]Did I equip it?
[31:28.20]Let's fucking go.
[31:31.38]This is not going to be close.
[31:33.16]That's what I've been saying.
[31:34.02]I think I got it.
[31:41.37]Yes.
[31:47.71]Okay.
[31:47.99]I'm, I'm assuming Zapnap, you are the best player here.
[31:51.90]Yes.
[31:52.32]Uh, I bestow that upon you.
[31:53.66]And so what that means for me is I want you to feel comfortable making shot calls.
[31:58.86]Okay.
[32:00.41]and we will we will follow you as if you are a compass command cavern we should drop like right now alright we're dropping okay it's space bar Jerma because I know alright we need to fight for the blimp there's gonna be people here so try and grab a gun immediately and take control of them got it oh there's npcs that that are going to be on this blimp they're called io soldiers they're not real characters but they can uh they can dice you up
[32:28.51]Doesn't look like we have too many people here with us.
[32:36.66]There's one other, at least one other player for sure.
[32:55.55]Guys, how do I land?
[32:58.27]Wait, what?
[33:00.15]What do you mean?
[33:01.79]Oh, you're on top?
[33:02.63]Yeah, you got to find a way in.
[33:04.27]You can also maybe pickaxe the roof and get in.
[33:06.67]Oh, people are shooting at us?
[33:07.92]I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[33:09.20]Okay.
[33:19.93]That's pretty big Oh, I'm getting beat what the hell was what is that?
[33:27.46]Oh, it's the fucking teleporting They had Dr. Dr. Scones.
[33:33.10]Yeah, he's downstairs.
[33:34.92]You guys might kill him and get his good guy.
[33:36.14]I think I'm He's really beefy, but if we all shoot him he dies kind of fast.
[33:42.58]Oh
[33:50.30]Yeah, I'm coming to you fire Where do you go?
[34:09.87]Oh I'm dead over here.
[34:12.33]I think it's a real guy.
[34:13.03]Yeah real person.
[34:14.61]I'm down.
[34:15.81]I'm down.
[34:16.13]Oh
[34:21.45]Coming up the back, back, back.
[34:23.19]No way.
[34:25.97]Dude.
[34:26.41]We got destroyed.
[34:27.65]That was Derek's team.
[34:29.79]No way.
[34:30.15]That was Derek's team.
[34:33.41]Restarting, restarting, restarting.
[34:35.93]Huh?
[34:36.93]We were restarting.
[34:38.75]Oh, yes.
[34:39.35]That's so big.
[34:40.67]That's so fucking big.
[34:42.43]Yes, sir.
[34:44.31]We just get killed?
[34:46.50]Yeah, just back out, just back out.
[34:47.72]Okay, Jerma, Jerma, we're restarting.
[34:48.90]That game didn't count.
[34:49.50]We got really lucky.
[34:52.26]Oh, wow.
[34:52.40]Okay.
[34:53.60]I did not know that fucking guy was going to be there.
[34:56.99]Yeah, we dealt with the NPC and then we got run up on.
[35:00.69]Yeah.
[35:02.01]Okay, someone in Taric's team is really bad.
[35:03.97]I don't know who it was.
[35:06.05]I don't know who it was, but they were like, yeah, they were really bad.
[35:08.87]Oh, that was probably Slicker.
[35:10.21]Oh, wait, no, that's not on their team.
[35:11.51]Wait, who's their new player?
[35:13.17]So that was an NPC we were fighting.
[35:16.50]The really powerful guy was an NPC, but then a real team dropped on our blimp.
[35:21.39]Oh, crap.
[35:22.33]There's a new code now.
[35:24.12]Okay, I'll put that in.
[35:31.43]I was unlucky that we just randomly got put off the spawn next to those guys.
[35:35.54]Holy shit.
[35:38.58]Once Taric and I don't even know who else got in there, they just annihilated us.
[35:42.12]Maybe it's better to go to a further blimp only because really confident players like them are just going to insta-drop.
[35:48.14]yeah I didn't I I wanted I chose that one because I didn't see like the ones that were further along was I saw were tilted and what's it the other crossroad one whatever it's called yeah and I know that puns this team was going to go for one of those two and I didn't want to fight puns oh fair enough
[36:07.69]Did you get the new code in Nick?
[36:09.87]Uh, yeah, yeah.
[36:10.67]I, I read it up.
[36:11.65]Alright.
[36:11.87]Ready?
[36:12.40]Uh, Jeremy got ready up.
[36:13.56]Oh yeah.
[36:14.90]My bad.
[36:15.88]It's only four games instead of five.
[36:18.14]So double bars is bad documented.
[36:20.72]So that might be the first on Tarek.
[36:21.98]Why, why would restarting what happened?
[36:24.38]Uh, I don't know.
[36:25.20]There must've been some error and then we also lost time.
[36:27.37]So now there's only four matches instead of five.
[36:29.47]Oh, okay.
[36:31.61]So I think I have enough to buy one dance this time.
[36:34.69]Oh, that's so big.
[36:35.45]That is so big.
[36:36.53]That helps.
[36:39.33]How about no sweat?
[36:42.77]Test it out?
[36:43.34]See how you like it?
[36:44.36]Sure.
[36:44.60]Uh, whatever.
[36:49.68]Dude, I can't get the, the gamer rage one again.
[36:51.80]Oh my god, my shop refreshed.
[36:52.98]That's crazy.
[36:54.16]Because it looked a lot like the so no head, uh.
[36:58.00]That's not the right one.
[36:59.79]I know, that's the default dance.
[37:04.07]Here we go.
[37:06.31]Oh, yes, sir.
[37:07.57]Good luck, Slime.
[37:08.21]Thank you.
[37:08.67]Protect Sykkuno from guns.
[37:10.63]Insane name to have in chat.
[37:12.75]But also, I agree.
[37:16.24]Why did your guy only use one hand for that dance?
[37:18.24]Is that a thing?
[37:18.70]I think that's the dance.
[37:23.78]Oh, dude.
[37:25.08]That one just tilts me.
[37:26.48]Yeah.
[37:27.26]I just get mad looking at it.
[37:28.70]Just know, after I kill someone, I will be popping this.
[37:31.40]Yeah, I'm dancing.
[37:32.62]I'm right there with you.
[37:33.48]I'm on this one.
[37:45.04]You got the one-handed floss?
[37:49.07]I so badly want to do this at one of the Fortnite concerts.
[37:57.49]Wait, is it a... Okay, no, it's the code we're already on.
[38:02.04]Someone said Taric's team thought we were randoms.
[38:05.27]Why would they think that?
[38:06.81]That's weird to think.
[38:07.63]Why would you think Royale come in my way as anyone but Jerma985?
[38:12.35]That's such a bot name.
[38:16.99]Randoms.
[38:19.06]Swag is for men.
[38:21.22]Yeah, these do, at least a couple of these feel like bot names.
[38:25.72]Well, Havapapa for sure.
[38:28.02]I've had this name since season 2.
[38:30.76]It's just supposed to be pandas, but pandas was taken at the time, so I just was like, boop, till the end.
[38:39.87]It does mess with the brain a bit, because you want to say pandas.
[38:43.53]A human mouth doesn't allow for that.
[38:48.98]People saying they can get Thanos?
[38:51.35]Yeah, Thanos is in the game.
[38:53.39]Dude, no shit, Will Smith is in this game.
[38:56.28]I think Moist had it on last week right after the Oscars thing.
[39:01.06]It was really funny to see Will Smith jumping around.
[39:04.72]I wouldn't have picked the Saturday morning cartoon Bane if I knew that I could get Thanos.
[39:11.95]Yeah, that's the thing.
[39:12.99]You gotta tune in next shop to see what V-Bucks you can spend, you know?
[39:17.91]That's how they get you.
[39:19.91]Oh, so you can't just go back into the catalog and buy a bunch of stuff that they did.
[39:24.62]Yeah.
[39:27.78]I guess that adds exclusivity to it, right?
[39:30.06]In a way.
[39:30.34]Do you guys think that... What are your thoughts on the Three Stooges making their appearance here in the next few weeks?
[39:39.33]I think that it's a game where four people can squad up, so there's an instant problem.
[39:44.89]Wow.
[39:45.11]That's a good point.
[39:46.03]That's true.
[39:48.48]Unless there was a fourth stooge, like the bonus Jonas.
[39:54.19]Well, what about Moe or Curly or something?
[39:56.07]Do you think that they have a chance?
[39:58.11]With the bowl cut, maybe.
[39:59.11]Yeah.
[40:04.04]shimp everyone should have to play with the beatles oh the beatles could be added no that's up because two of them two of them were murdered bro you can't do that you literally can't alright here we go here we go
[40:24.69]Paul McCartney is a fake.
[40:26.33]If the three Stooges are not added to this game by April 23rd, I believe I have to eat a glove on stream.
[40:34.11]That is so unfortunate.
[40:36.81]Like a latex glove or like a mechanic glove?
[40:38.73]I mean, I was so confident like two years ago.
[40:41.10]I gave a random date in the future.
[40:43.70]You know, I have a friend that did the same thing.
[40:45.98]He said at the beginning of 2018, Dr. Phil will die this year.
[40:49.70]And he didn't.
[40:50.66]So kind of ate his own words on that one.
[40:54.09]Where do you guys want to go with gear?
[40:57.31]Let's see.
[40:58.61]Maybe we can crank whatever this is.
[41:01.63]Yeah, I'm down.
[41:02.69]I'll be late.
[41:03.59]Yeah, let's do it.
[41:04.78]Yep.
[41:06.00]I think the later, too, the more safe we get.
[41:09.70]Well, I don't know.
[41:11.84]I think everyone is thinking that, so it's kind of a toss-up.
[41:15.46]I do like this spot, though.
[41:16.54]I think we can do a lot of good work.
[41:18.19]We can see there's a lot of people dropping right now.
[41:21.41]So, we're waiting to get all the way to the end here.
[41:23.96]Yeah.
[41:24.58]Drop when it says like 900 on the meters away from the ping.
[41:27.54]Cool.
[41:30.02]I guess you could go like maybe now.
[41:31.48]Yeah.
[41:32.10]I'm gonna go now.
[41:34.02]I don't really see too many people, so... Looks good.
[41:37.61]What's the best way to make it so I go over there and not across the whole game?
[41:42.07]Um... I don't exactly know what you're saying.
[41:45.17]You can pop your thing early by pressing spacebar.
[41:47.27]Oh, okay.
[41:47.47]If you don't want to go too low.
[41:48.61]Yeah.
[41:50.10]We should be fine for where we're dropping because you want to be higher.
[41:52.30]I think we're good.
[41:55.29]I don't think anyone's dropping here.
[41:57.93]We might be able to loot the town under us too and then come back up.
[42:00.33]This actually looks really good and there's going to be cars in this town so we don't have to worry about circle.
[42:08.54]Oh, there's one person.
[42:10.06]There's probably one team.
[42:11.58]Are we going into the blimp?
[42:13.28]Yeah.
[42:13.50]They missed the blimp.
[42:14.16]They're going to go.
[42:15.22]Oh, no.
[42:15.44]They made it.
[42:15.78]They're going inside right now.
[42:18.38]I'm bad.
[42:18.74]I'm bad.
[42:19.04]I'm bad.
[42:19.30]I'm bad.
[42:19.56]I'm bad.
[42:19.79]I'm so sorry.
[42:20.31]Did you fall?
[42:23.01]I hit a pixel.
[42:24.07]Did you fall?
[42:24.93]Yeah, I fell.
[42:25.63]I'm done.
[42:27.31]I'm so sorry.
[42:30.23]Let's do this.
[42:31.83]They're inside?
[42:35.55]I'm going to revive Nick and come right back up.
[42:37.21]It might be worth to actually bail on the blimp because we have two down here right now.
[42:40.59]Yeah.
[42:40.69]There's one on top right now.
[42:41.87]If I jump off, am I safe?
[42:45.87]If you jump off, you'll take the ball damage.
[42:47.69]We might have to just hit the town.
[42:49.13]Somebody shoot him.
[42:50.39]Let's hit the town.
[42:50.93]Coming.
[42:51.07]Coming.
[42:51.63]There's a guy right here.
[42:52.75]Right in front of me.
[42:57.33]I'm down.
[42:57.69]Cracked.
[42:58.29]Found him.
[42:59.65]I'm going for a gun because I have no health.
[43:01.63]Oh my god.
[43:03.63]Right there.
[43:04.25]Shit.
[43:05.15]Oh, dude.
[43:06.07]We're so fucking good.
[43:07.78]XQC's team.
[43:09.06]Okay.
[43:09.88]Fuck.
[43:10.14]We're actually just only playing.
[43:11.78]That was Mendo XQC.
[43:12.82]Holy shit.
[43:15.18]We're playing the best in the game right now.
[43:16.60]Dude, I've never played one minute of this game.
[43:19.56]Okay.
[43:19.86]I don't know how to land the fucking sky dive.
[43:24.57]That wasn't bad.
[43:26.29]Ludwig, what are you doing in the call?
[43:29.37]Oh, sorry.
[43:29.73]Sorry.
[43:29.93]Just spectating.
[43:30.95]What do you want, Ludwig?
[43:32.09]I'm doing what you guys are doing.
[43:32.93]Spectating.
[43:34.98]I don't like this guy anyone else sort of sharing that feeling did did you think it's fair that tarik is playing this video game oh he must be gone oh he's gone yeah he left sorry what happened there um alright I trolled uh my my character's foot hit like a pixel which made me insta drop off my parasail and then I just went straight down
[44:00.31]Oh, shit.
[44:01.33]And then we dropped with maybe the best team in the lobby at the moment.
[44:06.01]Oh.
[44:07.91]Or at least one of them.
[44:08.85]Are people going for blimps?
[44:10.07]Are we screwing ourselves by going blimp?
[44:12.88]We might have to.
[44:13.98]We might have to.
[44:17.86]With that, with an audible, that's fine.
[44:20.68]What is in the blimp that's very important?
[44:23.74]It's less about what's in there, and it's more that you have high ground constantly.
[44:26.80]Oh, okay.
[44:27.63]And teams, like, the whole goal is just to live the longest, right?
[44:30.23]So if you can, like, have a really high spot where it's hard for people to kill you, then, and also be in a place where people don't often, like, try to take over late, then it's just good.
[44:44.77]This person's in a tent.
[44:47.18]No.
[44:48.04]Dude, if they're tenting, I'm not a narc.
[44:50.46]I would never... Oh, wait.
[44:51.62]Did I just catch... Wait.
[44:52.94]What happened?
[45:00.31]Maybe you're allowed to tent to heal, but not to score.
[45:02.49]I think we ran into some bad luck, boys, and I think it's no big deal.
[45:09.19]I'm telling you.
[45:10.17]Just give me a weapon, and I'll shine.
[45:15.34]I haven't held a weapon either one of these two games.
[45:19.39]Dude, Shroud is just literally melting people.
[45:21.61]Oh, no.
[45:22.29]He took out Mango's team single-handedly.
[45:25.19]He is God's gift to all of gaming, and he's in the same tournament.
[45:29.26]Smokey got Taric.
[45:35.94]Okay, good to know.
[45:38.58]Dr. Lupo.
[45:40.34]Dr. Lupo is... He's good, right?
[45:42.86]Dr. Lupo is, I believe, a very seasoned player.
[45:45.61]Very good, right?
[45:46.21]I feel like this is the one to watch at the moment.
[45:53.37]Sykkuno's team is a powerhouse of content.
[45:56.43]Taric got rebooted.
[46:06.94]But you can get in that thing?
[46:08.85]Yeah, you can like launch yourself.
[46:13.00]I didn't know you could Gonzo the Great out of that.
[46:14.44]I would have just done that.
[46:17.28]What do you call it?
[46:18.58]Gonzo the Great.
[46:20.08]Yeah, okay.
[46:28.07]Whoa, that's cool.
[46:28.55]He's going to get inside the mind of Sykkuno right now.
[46:34.26]Dude, Dodger Lupo's Fortnite level, 153?
[46:35.97]Oh, shit.
[46:37.29]Guys, it's too late to get a vape pen.
[46:44.37]I can't do it right now.
[46:52.54]Yeah, blimps seem to be what everyone is trying to do.
[46:54.98]Yeah.
[46:55.82]I think we should avoid blimps.
[46:59.88]What's another good place to hang out?
[47:04.51]I'm behind on that.
[47:05.25]I'm not sure.
[47:06.01]I think it's just about, like... It's kind of lucky, right?
[47:09.37]Because, like, you could say, like, oh, drop far away, but then other teams are also saying drop far away.
[47:15.50]We're really just trying to set ourselves up with, like, enough gear and decent positions so that we don't have to worry about looting.
[47:20.72]We can just get live off the spawn.
[47:23.68]We can...
[47:25.63]It'll help us a lot.
[47:26.87]Yeah.
[47:27.35]On's like just the most, it's just coin flip.
[47:29.80]Yeah.
[47:30.72]Guys, I'm not going to order a vape pen off of Uber Eats.
[47:35.22]That would be the stupidest fucking thing ever.
[47:40.44]Uber Eats?
[47:43.00]No, I'm not vaping a vape pen.
[47:44.54]I'm not going to inhale nicotine for fun.
[47:50.19]The place is the very end, but people who drop before the auto drop will just get there first.
[47:55.19]So if we want to go to the end, let's just drop before the end, you know?
[47:58.19]Yeah.
[47:59.97]I mean, like, how much are you craving, like, nicotine where you need to Uber- Why is there a car over there?
[48:09.40]This is just like a regular red sedan just parked on a hill.
[48:13.74]Yeah, there's just some car-ass cars in this game.
[48:16.12]And then there's, like, Lambos with jet rockets.
[48:21.23]Wait, there are people- Ooh.
[48:24.81]Oh.
[48:27.67]That was a good shot.
[48:30.75]Watching Tubbo right now.
[48:32.67]How do you switch teams you're watching?
[48:34.63]Oh, you just keep pressing next.
[48:35.73]Yeah, you just gotta keep going.
[48:40.87]I'm trying to learn as I watch.
[48:46.41]Yeah, all the teams are just like trying to get as high as possible.
[48:50.04]For one second I thought that was like a Kars crossover and there was a Kars skin.
[48:53.40]That was like Lightning McQueen.
[48:56.41]Oh, I just turned to IPN and it's Chun Li from Street Fighter with the dump truck.
[49:05.40]Tubbo is Bruno Mars.
[49:12.35]Shit.
[49:13.45]I bet Epic could just make Celebrity Deathmatch with all the IP they own.
[49:17.37]Or like have access to licensing too.
[49:19.39]So this squad is all still up.
[49:21.97]Which squad?
[49:22.23]It's the... Crashion.
[49:25.19]Disguised Toast.
[49:26.50]Oh no.
[49:26.78]Somebody's dead.
[49:27.94]Crashion just died.
[49:28.92]Oh no no.
[49:29.22]Crashion's right here.
[49:31.88]The health bar is like really bugged.
[49:33.42]Sometimes it'll just show people are dead when they're not.
[49:35.66]I feel like I'm stuck in between two teams.
[49:39.08]Yeah.
[49:39.56]I've had that happen to me.
[49:40.42]That's why I was asking like how do you switch teams.
[49:43.03]but I just kept pressing next player and eventually I got out of the genjutsu.
[49:47.79]I don't care about the flavored vape pens.
[49:49.99]I'm not going to eat, like inhale like apple cinnamon nicotine.
[49:53.70]No, I don't want to do that.
[49:54.76]Is there a way to see the list of people?
[50:02.44]Yo, guess what?
[50:03.00]You shouldn't either.
[50:05.54]You shouldn't even know what that is.
[50:08.84]You shouldn't even know what that is.
[50:09.82]You're not old enough to know what that is.
[50:11.08]I'm playing Fortnite today.
[50:18.84]Yeah, I'm stuck in the tier zoo team now.
[50:21.64]Yeah, it said that you're spectating me now.
[50:24.08]I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna sit here.
[50:27.64]Enjoy the view while I can.
[50:28.72]I hate being, like, trying to switch out and just being stuck in between two teams.
[50:36.17]Oh my god, every team is trying so hard.
[50:37.93]Holy shit.
[50:40.03]This is crazy.
[50:40.71]The tier zoo team is just in bushes at the edge of the map.
[50:43.93]The very, very edge.
[50:45.03]Daily dose is bad, man.
[50:50.08]So you kind of just want to grab, you want to get a bunch of items, get a spot and just kind of defend that spot till the circle starts to kind of encroach on you, right?
[50:58.37]Yeah.
[50:59.53]You also kind of want to play to kill people though.
[51:01.55]Like I think, I think like the way that the team, like TierZoo's team is playing, where they're just playing on the edge of the map, like best case scenario, they get to like the final couple of teams and they're in like a pretty bad position.
[51:12.18]And then they like, maybe they probably die and you get points for every kill your team has.
[51:18.26]Oh, okay.
[51:18.74]So you do want to change your placement.
[51:20.29]So you get like a certain amount of points for like placing top three.
[51:23.37]But you... Every kill you get also adds on top of that.
[51:26.41]So like you do have some level of pressure to be aggressive.
[51:29.95]Okay.
[51:30.35]Which is why being somewhat central and being high up is good because then you get to see people trying to rotate.
[51:36.05]But you're also in like a good spot.
[51:37.73]Looking at Justin Minx's team.
[51:39.19]Looks like it's going down here.
[51:42.60]Uh oh.
[51:45.08]This is trouble.
[51:46.49]This is a lot of trouble.
[51:49.71]Not quite.
[51:56.17]Thermal is so busted man.
[51:58.08]Thermal is really good.
[52:03.42]I'm very invested.
[52:07.28]Yeah.
[52:09.53]This is a good team right here.
[52:11.12]Who's anonymous257?
[52:12.00]I want to know who that is.
[52:13.04]Yeah, I was wondering that too.
[52:14.60]Actually, we can look in the Discord.
[52:16.86]It's probably Shroud?
[52:17.80]Actually, I don't know.
[52:24.97]That team is Lily, Timmy.
[52:27.65]Is it Lily?
[52:29.41]I don't hate Fortnite.
[52:30.44]I just don't understand Fortnite.
[52:36.22]Another team, who'd they eliminate?
[52:37.42]Oh.
[52:38.78]Jody, Peter.
[52:45.60]Oh my god.
[52:45.85]So how many squads are still up?
[52:49.87]Uh, well there's 40 people.
[52:52.61]But it doesn't say the team amount.
[52:54.59]There's a big fight going on with Timmy's team.
[53:01.31]Ooh.
[53:03.27]Ooh.
[53:04.69]I feel like I'm playing against, like, professional soccer players in a game of football.
[53:10.34]And I, like, am a video gamer.
[53:12.48]Yeah.
[53:15.50]Oh, my God.
[53:16.48]It's like when one of those celebrity athletes comes to your school to visit, and you're, like, in elementary school.
[53:22.47]And they're just, like, giant, giant mountains of humans, and you're like, damn.
[53:26.17]And then it's, oh, we're gonna play some baseball together.
[53:29.01]And they just hit, like, five home runs, and everybody cheers.
[53:34.00]Oh, man.
[53:41.15]Well, they're reviving.
[53:45.20]Holy shit, dude.
[53:46.34]Alec, my friend who got taken off our team, his team is just destroying.
[53:52.94]Happy for him.
[53:54.18]I am happy for him.
[53:54.91]It's actually either you or him.
[53:56.85]What is going on over here, by the way?
[53:59.79]It takes a long time to revive somebody, does it?
[54:03.25]Yeah, it takes 10 seconds, but you can double up.
[54:05.27]You can cut it in half if two people revive.
[54:07.53]Why was she just spray-painting herself in the face?
[54:10.59]Uh, it's a heal.
[54:11.41]Oh, okay.
[54:12.96]Yeah, it heals you, like, 15 every, like, something.
[54:16.62]Every, like, half a second or something.
[54:18.26]Oh!
[54:18.84]That was crazy.
[54:20.16]Oh!
[54:22.28]Who was that?
[54:22.88]God.
[54:25.88]Swiped the whole team.
[54:29.15]Who is prospering?
[54:31.13]Oh wow, I got Punz.
[54:32.13]Punz is the only one on his team left.
[54:33.71]Oh yeah, he is.
[54:34.45]Oh, he's right behind the team.
[54:39.27]The team doesn't see him.
[54:41.71]Somebody just said, dude, why?
[54:43.59]Please tell me this is fake.
[54:47.31]My April Fool's joke was four days late, alright?
[54:55.41]Please tell me this is fake.
[54:58.51]I can assure you it's real, but I can tell you it's a few days late.
[55:03.31]And I don't have the fate pen, but whatever.
[55:05.45]I'm just playing Fortnite.
[55:06.23]I'm not kidding.
[55:06.85]I'm playing Fortnite.
[55:07.45]I'm not kidding.
[55:14.58]I'm watching Shroud, and he's not thirsting at all.
[55:18.98]He downs him, and he moves on to the next chump.
[55:21.24]Yeah, honorable gamer.
[55:22.76]What's XQC doing?
[55:25.96]He wants them to get revived so he can put them back down.
[55:28.20]He's like, please fucking rez.
[55:32.44]Oh, he's just better.
[55:41.81]Oh!
[55:43.81]Shit.
[55:44.35]Oh!
[55:44.45]SUC down.
[55:45.68]That was crazy.
[55:53.78]Huber reaction.
[55:54.58]I've got to do something, man, when it's watching TV.
[56:00.62]Who's the shark?
[56:01.48]Who has the shark skin?
[56:03.79]It's just an actual shark in the game.
[56:06.17]I was like, what the fuck is this?
[56:09.61]Yeah, this game is terrible.
[56:11.19]Because they weren't doing anything.
[56:12.41]I was like, why are they not attacking this person?
[56:13.99]I thought it was like a transformation where he did like... Yeah, dude.
[56:18.09]He's nuts.
[56:25.85]Ludwig wouldn't let our friend's little brother play because he's good at Fortnite, but he let Shroud in the tournament.
[56:30.83]Oh, Ludwig fucked up.
[56:32.03]Bro, Shroud is dicing everyone.
[56:33.81]Okay, he's down.
[56:35.03]What's Shroud's name?
[56:37.69]Shroudy Rowdy.
[56:39.05]Oh, he's dead.
[56:42.63]He literally just died.
[56:44.29]The rest of his team is up.
[56:50.49]Hunz is just big chilling.
[56:52.14]Is this Batman?
[56:55.18]Oh, nade shot's down?
[56:56.30]Is this the end of their team?
[56:57.24]No, they're resing.
[57:00.60]They got nade up.
[57:01.35]He has a med kit.
[57:04.99]Did they... We're stream 2022.
[57:06.45]You can't say that yet.
[57:07.37]It's not over.
[57:07.81]Nade shot with his level 1 account.
[57:16.42]Just vibing.
[57:18.10]Whoever they're fighting right now is just so dead.
[57:25.45]What am I going to add to make it better?
[57:26.61]Bro, I just told you we were doing tier lists after this.
[57:30.62]This is not going to last that.
[57:31.42]This is only going to be another half hour or 40 minutes.
[57:39.02]Do you guys see Punz?
[57:40.10]He's just been hiding.
[57:41.60]Yeah.
[57:46.35]That is so smart.
[57:49.37]I almost just call this guy Han Solo.
[57:51.31]What's Boba Fett's in the game?
[57:54.18]Yeah, I think so.
[57:55.35]Yeah, they did Star Wars stuff.
[57:58.23]That's kind of cool.
[57:59.25]Alright, DailyDose's team gets wiped.
[58:01.21]Wait, Punz can win this.
[58:03.69]Oh, he fucked up.
[58:04.33]Oh, Taric's the only one left on this team, I think.
[58:06.39]Unless the health bars are glitched.
[58:08.03]Wubby's whole team is up.
[58:12.94]Oh, Punz is fucked here.
[58:13.98]Aww.
[58:24.62]They should rush the nade team.
[58:28.46]Wait, is it 1v1?
[58:28.98]No.
[58:29.28]Oh, nade team's done.
[58:32.47]I'm not going to do a vape flavor tier list.
[58:34.73]I don't know what it even tastes like.
[58:35.99]It probably tastes like ass.
[58:38.37]Alright.
[58:38.65]So they're all going to F. Oh, my God.
[58:41.59]He like fifth partied.
[58:42.38]Oh, it's a 4v1.
[58:43.76]Oh, one shot.
[58:49.46]Oh, that's toast.
[58:50.66]Toast to the last.
[58:52.49]Wait, I was just on Bubby's POV and then I went right to Trace when he headshot him.
[58:56.61]Anthony, Alex in the final team.
[58:58.55]That is crazy.
[59:01.82]Oh, that's... Holy shit.
[59:08.04]Okay.
[59:08.56]Wow.
[59:09.98]Alright, rough start, but... It was prospering, guys.
[59:17.65]Pretty good.
[59:19.63]I think we'll be alright this time.
[59:21.88]First one didn't count.
[59:23.28]Second one, we just got unlucky.
[59:24.78]Like, everybody went there.
[59:26.10]And I was still figuring out how to detach the parachute.
[59:29.50]I know how to do that.
[59:30.18]I know how to detach the parachute now.
[59:31.66]I think we're in a better position than we were before.
[59:34.11]We got it now.
[59:35.29]I'm optimistic.
[59:36.37]You know what they say, Jeremiah?
[59:37.25]You gotta be down to come back.
[59:39.93]Yeah.
[59:42.19]Also, you only ever win or learn.
[59:44.97]That's a good way to put it.
[59:46.69]I learned so much just now watching that whole game, almost the entire game.
[59:50.56]I was only able to watch it.
[59:55.28]They're predicting a lot of strats.
[59:57.24]I actually got the most perspective because I got to watch every player who wasn't me.
[60:02.82]Why is it headshotting everybody?
[60:08.42]Okay, let's get this second code going.
[60:10.98]Oh, man.
[60:12.06]I have to leave.
[60:14.96]I'll be right back.
[60:17.02]Wait, what happened?
[60:18.16]How do I get out of here?
[60:20.30]Top left.
[60:21.82]Or escape key, maybe.
[60:22.84]Bottom left is maybe a cancel.
[60:24.97]Someone said we're not last, which is kind of hype.
[60:33.11]No, we are.
[60:33.55]We finished 19th.
[60:34.41]There's 19 teams.
[60:36.31]I'm banning that guy.
[60:39.36]Easy.
[60:39.96]So there's 19 teams.
[60:41.24]We came in 19th place.
[60:41.90]Yeah.
[60:44.14]I think we got really unlucky.
[60:46.04]We really did.
[60:48.24]It's not over.
[60:51.28]I wish there were still five matches, but... People in my chat are voting to see if we're going to win the next round.
[61:02.61]It's not a straight bet.
[61:06.71]If you were taking odds on this, what's the odds that we come in first place next game?
[61:10.29]1-19.
[61:12.01]No.
[61:12.21]19.
[61:12.50]100%.
[61:12.52]100%?
[61:12.54]We're winning this one.
[61:13.50]We got unlucky.
[61:15.58]I think the payout would be like 6,000 to 1.
[61:17.46]If you were to bet on us right now.
[61:18.66]Are the odds?
[61:18.94]Somebody could make a lot of money.
[61:41.24]I just feel like the results of the last match weren't indicative of our team's overall skill.
[61:45.88]Mm-hmm.
[61:46.76]Or connectiveness.
[61:48.62]Or... Chemistry.
[61:50.05]Yeah, I think we should stay away from blimps because blimps are a little confusing.
[61:53.99]They're, like, genuinely confusing to navigate on the inside and get to and get up and down.
[61:58.77]And we can just go to, like...
[62:00.80]Just some town and loot up.
[62:03.40]Also, I want to make sure I get, because I don't want to be a moron when we start this.
[62:06.62]If one of you guys goes down, is it, you know, you get to a position where you can, like, Left 4 Dead revive somebody, right?
[62:13.28]Just like E, hold E, tap E?
[62:14.92]Yeah, you hold it.
[62:15.73]Hold it, okay.
[62:17.05]And you can't move around, like, physically while doing it.
[62:19.67]You have to just stay still.
[62:21.25]You're kind of using your positional currency by rezzing.
[62:25.07]Sure.
[62:36.58]This is cool regardless.
[62:39.92]No, it's only cool if we win.
[62:44.22]I was gonna wait till we won, and then we could... Say this is only fun because we won.
[62:50.49]Yeah, yeah.
[63:01.51]Not now.
[63:06.55]It's just unlucky.
[63:07.31]We got two teams that are really, really, really good teams that have really good players.
[63:13.11]We ran into them back-to-back first, second.
[63:15.33]It is crazy that we fought Taric's team, and then we got a lucky reset, and then we fought xQc's team.
[63:21.54]Yeah, I know, right?
[63:23.12]I killed someone on that blimp.
[63:24.98]I don't know who they were.
[63:25.92]They have some weird name.
[63:27.16]I think it might have been IPN.
[63:34.99]I wish I would have landed on the blimp, dude.
[63:36.40]If we would have killed that team.
[63:38.54]Oh, that's so nice.
[63:39.28]Fuck.
[63:42.30]The stream's not over yet.
[63:44.34]Oh, I can't wait.
[63:45.12]I can't wait for those worst stream 2022 Andes to wait till I do the full FromSoftware every single boss ever tier list because that's coming up and I want to see your face when you see how fun that is.
[63:59.77]But I get cool backpacks.
[64:02.55]I'm going to buy something right now.
[64:03.51]You got me inspired.
[64:10.82]oh bullet time is so swag I'm I'm very confident that we'll at least we will at least land this time and at least congregate somewhere with weapons yes sir get you a rifle in your hand
[64:37.25]five fish sticks in the oven um man let me ask you guys this in the call here yeah so you know how in the back of uh a lot of frozen foods it's like 50 plus minutes sometimes to heat up but it's like four minutes in the microwave yeah yeah how when do you guys decide to use the oven
[65:02.68]Can I tell you my filthy little secret?
[65:05.92]My filthy little dirty secret I have?
[65:08.08]Sure.
[65:11.44]I prefer microwaved food.
[65:15.31]To oven-made food.
[65:16.67]Yeah, you're just like a sludge monster.
[65:19.55]Just because it's faster?
[65:21.89]For me, it's because it's faster.
[65:24.34]No, for me, it is taste.
[65:25.76]That's why I'm a filthy monster.
[65:27.86]I actually think that... How do I put this?
[65:31.74]You know how, like, you know, shit that you put in the oven and microwave, it's already, like, a certain quality threshold that it can't break through.
[65:38.68]Like, it has a hard ceiling of how good it can be.
[65:43.22]Also, game two's in the thing.
[65:45.90]I have the code in there, and we're ready.
[65:49.26]Awesome.
[65:50.70]What's the last thing you guys ate that was, like, a microwaved food or a frozen food?
[65:57.43]Microwaving.
[65:58.17]I do microwave leftovers all the time.
[65:59.81]That's just simple.
[66:01.01]but like a packaged like disgusting trash meal I had a uh I had a digiorno pizza on my trip to Arizona a couple weeks ago brotherhood yeah that's alright no but I mean I I wouldn't put that in the microwave I would never put would you ever put a chicken pot pie in the microwave yeah oh come on I used to eat those that's why I'm only this tall
[66:27.43]The frozen chicken pot pie has to go in the oven.
[66:31.58]Even if it takes like an hour.
[66:32.46]It has to.
[66:33.62]Yeah, maybe for you, I guess.
[66:34.80]Yeah, maybe if you're from the 50s and you hand crank your radio.
[66:39.68]And you do it in black and white, yeah.
[66:41.20]I'm fucking busy, brother.
[66:42.44]Alright, so what would you put in?
[66:46.34]Oh, god damn it.
[66:47.20]Talking about chicken pot pies.
[66:50.02]Is that why they came?
[66:52.01]Somebody said they came to watch you stream.
[66:53.29]We're just sitting here talking about frozen food and I didn't ready up yet?
[66:58.13]Sorry about the banter.
[66:59.87]Sabna, what's the last frozen food thing you ate?
[67:01.85]Dude, I actually don't remember.
[67:04.90]You live healthy.
[67:06.44]That's really good, though.
[67:07.52]Let's be honest.
[67:08.36]I try to eat pretty good.
[67:10.94]I don't remember the last frozen food thing.
[67:13.00]I really don't.
[67:14.78]I used to grind Final Fantasy XIV and just eat Pop-Tarts all day in college.
[67:18.46]I think I ate just like 2,000 calories a day in Pop-Tarts.
[67:21.18]Again, it's why my bones, I'm sure, are hollow like a bird's.
[67:27.18]That's actually really good.
[67:28.24]I remember my first year of college, I used to eat so much Pop-Tarts and like
[67:33.41]what's it called, Hot Pockets and that type of stuff.
[67:35.51]I'd tear it up.
[67:36.07]You know what actually is good in the microwave is those Trader Joe's tiki masalas.
[67:43.48]Those are unbelievable.
[67:46.26]Trader Joe's constantly is blowing me away.
[67:50.16]That actually might be the best frozen food item that exists is the tiki masala from Trader Joe's.
[67:55.52]Like, honest to God, there's nothing that compares frozen-wise.
[68:04.19]Jerma, who is your best friend?
[68:05.43]Um... Uh, Burger Boy.
[68:13.20]Wait, what was that?
[68:13.94]Burger Boy?
[68:14.64]Are we getting owned?
[68:19.76]Yeah, Burger Boy these nuts in your mouth.
[68:22.38]Whoa, hey!
[68:24.05]I don't know, I was... I tried to get ahead of it.
[68:28.20]Who's burger boy?
[68:29.06]Look, I don't have a best friend because I think that that's stupid.
[68:32.33]Because all of your other friends then have to know, oh, that's your best friend.
[68:37.87]No, I have, everyone's on the same playing field for me.
[68:40.59]Dibs.
[68:43.95]Well, we're not there yet.
[68:50.56]You can't, a centrist?
[68:51.68]How is that a centrist?
[68:53.62]It's a centrist position.
[68:55.06]That person is correct.
[68:57.30]No, they are not.
[68:59.87]Because I don't have a best friend makes me a centrist.
[69:04.55]Yeah.
[69:05.82]Yes, sir, Mr. President, sir.
[69:09.88]Sapnap, who's your best friend?
[69:13.80]I guess, like, my takes, I have, like, a few.
[69:16.20]You know what I mean?
[69:16.84]That's fair.
[69:17.54]Like, my group of, like, friends that I'm, like, really close with.
[69:21.26]I'd probably be, like, Dream, George, Carl Quackity.
[69:26.09]It's a circle rather than like yeah, it's like a circle.
[69:28.39]It's not like yeah, you are incredibly well-rounded Can I just say like you're right?
[69:33.53]You've got a good friend.
[69:35.67]Yeah You are very well-rounded you go for the blimp, you know when to knock over the I need you to start pointing out some flaws if you're gonna gel with this team
[69:49.48]Let me guess.
[69:50.12]You care too much?
[69:51.14]You work too hard?
[69:52.02]Yeah.
[69:52.16]I guess.
[69:52.90]I'm just too goaded.
[69:53.96]Show up early.
[69:54.60]No.
[69:55.64]Okay.
[69:55.94]I'm really bad.
[69:56.60]I'm bad at showing up on time.
[69:58.90]So, what's the plan here, guys?
[70:00.02]What are we doing?
[70:01.09]Alright.
[70:01.39]We're endgame.
[70:02.21]And I think... You guys want to crank it shifty shafts?
[70:06.02]Let's do it.
[70:06.80]Wherever you guys want to go.
[70:07.74]Wherever you guys want to go, I'm down.
[70:08.72]I think shifty shafts is good.
[70:10.76]I think if there's a lot of people, we stay together.
[70:13.32]We stay together like a tight unit.
[70:15.03]If there's a lot of people, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[70:17.71]We crank it to the lumber yards.
[70:18.85]There's like a million people here.
[70:19.95]Sounds good.
[70:34.09]It's like a team.
[70:35.69]Yeah, like a team.
[70:38.65]They're dropping before.
[70:39.79]Pivot.
[70:41.83]You guys want to pivot?
[70:43.35]I'm too close to pivot.
[70:44.33]I can't pivot anymore.
[70:44.93]Alright, we're sticking to it.
[70:46.49]Stick to it, baby.
[70:48.23]Fuck, I got a sniper rifle.
[70:51.00]I'm with you.
[70:51.52]There's one going to chase us right now.
[70:52.80]Get down, get down.
[70:53.36]Behind, down here, down here.
[70:57.10]I'm down.
[70:58.48]Oh, no.
[70:59.14]Coming, coming.
[71:03.76]No way, I'm fucking down again.
[71:05.62]Shit!
[71:07.54]Back here, back to me, back to me, back to me.
[71:09.12]Yeah, I'm coming to you.
[71:10.86]Oh fuck, oh my god, no, not again!
[71:14.20]Anthony, live, Anthony, live.
[71:15.92]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[71:17.70]Don't fight, Anthony, you're gonna live, you're gonna live.
[71:19.28]You can pick me up and run.
[71:21.08]I'm living.
[71:25.55]No!
[71:26.93]Please, please!
[71:28.41]Dude, that didn't fucking happen twice.
[71:30.55]What's happening?
[71:33.13]We got killed by shroud and we got killed by In the casino of life we seem to fucking keep losing dude is that is that for real are you kidding?
[71:54.52]Holy shit.
[71:54.74]If Ludwig comes in here, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind, I swear.
[71:58.00]We gotta pick a spot on the map that's like in the ocean.
[72:03.20]We are going so fucking far away.
[72:06.10]I just wanna at least stream the game for five minutes!
[72:13.08]Dude, Shroud is just tearing everyone up.
[72:16.04]I'm so guilty.
[72:16.74]Why is he so- Oh my god.
[72:17.58]He's using a deagle!
[72:18.16]Yup.
[72:18.30]He's so good.
[72:19.40]He's just better.
[72:21.22]He's literally using the deagle.
[72:23.58]I'm mad about losing to him, but it's just, you love to see him walk away too, you know what I mean?
[72:32.25]What the fuck?
[72:34.05]No, Ludwig, undefin.
[72:36.13]He better fucking undefin.
[72:37.43]What?
[72:38.01]Say something, Ludwig.
[72:39.39]What?
[72:40.09]Can I help you?
[72:41.01]Every fucking drop, we have dropped into goddamn Shroud.
[72:46.13]You know, Shroud is, you know, he's pretty fucking good.
[72:50.13]Yeah, here's the thing.
[72:50.86]Pay Money Wubby's beating him, so... Yeah, because he's held out by his teammates, dude.
[72:59.12]This is unreal.
[73:01.17]No, we've had bad RNG on our drops.
[73:03.87]Hey.
[73:05.17]Hey.
[73:07.45]No, we've landed three separate spots.
[73:09.53]We've landed a Shroud twice, and XQC's came the other time.
[73:21.37]Good luck game three, guys.
[73:22.11]Good luck game three.
[73:24.79]I'm so tilted.
[73:26.13]I just want to hold a weapon.
[73:27.15]Now we have to watch the whole fucking game again.
[73:29.09]Oh my god, dude.
[73:32.55]I just want to know what it's like to shoot a weapon.
[73:35.13]I know.
[73:36.33]No, I knew because I ran downstairs in the mines and I was destroying someone and I got two-tapped by a Deag and I was like, damn, whoever two-tapped me with that Deag is really good.
[73:45.61]And then I saw the fucking kill feed and I was like, god damn it.
[73:49.75]Bro.
[73:52.55]Okay, now you can nominate for WarStream.
[73:56.71]After that one.
[73:57.27]Because they'll be like, what am I supposed to do about it?
[73:59.76]What am I supposed to do?
[74:05.76]We land and we're just dead.
[74:07.86]I haven't even held a weapon yet.
[74:09.04]I don't even know what this is like.
[74:11.22]I don't know what the trajectory of moving your character feels like.
[74:15.20]Like, I don't know what the knots per second it is when you're actually walking around.
[74:18.84]I don't think I've walked around.
[74:19.92]I think I've landed with the parachute and died in five to ten seconds.
[74:25.79]Oh my god.
[74:28.31]I mean, it's funny, but I mean, I was just sure there's not a whole lot of content going on for me.
[74:34.95]You want to come over, ZapNap?
[74:36.77]We can beat this shit out of Ludwig together.
[74:39.81]We can do it together.
[74:42.03]He's earned it, honestly.
[74:43.96]He's had it too good for too long.
[74:48.13]Yeah, I said I think I'm going to surprise some people.
[74:51.17]If I had a... I have that fucking Minecraft axe in my hand.
[74:56.35]And I don't know what all these places are.
[74:59.31]I haven't even held a weapon yet.
[75:01.35]If you put a weapon in my hand...
[75:04.49]I was about to walk around the corner and melee swing at Shroud.
[75:09.40]Do you understand what how dire it is right now on this team?
[75:13.32]We just keep... He would have thought I was a bot.
[75:16.18]He would have thought I was a bot.
[75:19.36]This is path.
[75:21.96]What if...
[75:24.68]Sorry, okay, what if we- if there's a team, we just fucking go away.
[75:28.84]Like, we don't take the- the initial fight ever.
[75:31.90]Yeah, we loot first.
[75:32.67]We loot first no matter what, even if we think the team's bad.
[75:36.61]So it's like, if we see a team, uh, you know, we just mark a different spot, overshoot, or something like that.
[75:43.59]I think that's our best chance to get out of the- Yeah, maybe we even- maybe we even drop really high, so that we have advantage on, like, where people are going, and then we can- we can decide.
[75:58.93]We don't need to hit the ground first if we're going somewhere no one went.
[76:03.07]Oh no.
[76:03.43]Daily dose.
[76:06.19]I love that guy.
[76:07.93]He's hiding.
[76:08.73]He's trying not to die.
[76:10.25]I hate that guy, but I like his content.
[76:11.55]That's what I should have done.
[76:14.03]You hate him because he's succeeding in the game?
[76:16.27]He's trying to get water.
[76:17.55]He's like, water please!
[76:18.67]I feel like he's gonna put his head in there and start drinking.
[76:24.02]Someone said at least we're consistent, and that is true and valid and right.
[76:28.17]He's lost in the desert.
[76:31.41]Oh, no.
[76:32.75]Oh, no.
[76:36.57]What?
[76:37.42]Oh, they're on the same team.
[76:38.34]Okay.
[76:39.90]Trout's in a semi-truck, man.
[76:47.73]Rocket launcher.
[76:58.12]This is a cool Fortnite react stream.
[77:01.78]Yeah.
[77:02.00]Reacting to the Ludwig tournament.
[77:04.36]Hey, I'm doing tier lists after this.
[77:07.76]I was going to be live anyways.
[77:21.07]Wubby currently exchanging fire.
[77:29.21]Damn.
[77:29.61]I hope he's good at this game.
[77:33.39]Like, really good.
[77:37.05]Yeah, I actually didn't watch him play the whole last game, and then he's just finished first.
[77:42.17]I don't think he had it like that.
[77:44.27]I mean, can we at the very least get in a laugh-out-loud car?
[77:50.98]Yeah, buddy, we can do that.
[77:51.88]Can we?
[77:52.58]Like, if we're gonna die and we lose and get in the last place, can we at least do, like, the funny we're in the car joke?
[78:06.35]Okay, for all you worst stream ever Andes, alright?
[78:12.31]I'm gonna redress it anymore.
[78:14.01]I'm not gonna redress it anymore.
[78:16.05]I'm just telling you.
[78:18.59]You need to respect me for a minute.
[78:21.74]Respect me.
[78:22.92]For one moment.
[78:24.30]Okay?
[78:25.30]Worst stream ever Andes.
[78:27.20]Need to quiet the W.
[78:33.64]We just need to get... I feel like... I actually feel like we have a good chance if we can just get... Like, stay alive.
[78:38.48]Dude, I have died with no gun in my hand both matches.
[78:42.15]Me too.
[78:43.21]I turn the corner and there's two people dead and then... And then I get like... I don't know, like an assassin throws a knife in the back of my neck.
[78:49.37]I don't even know what happens to me.
[78:59.25]I'm getting so much shit in my chat.
[79:00.69]Everybody hates me.
[79:06.53]Oh my god.
[79:07.48]Shroud is so good.
[79:11.58]Yeah, I just said that you guys were like hating, so they'd be like, oh, I'm sorry, dude.
[79:32.85]Wait, what did we say?
[79:34.76]I'm watching this incredible gameplay.
[79:36.34]It's good.
[79:47.66]What, what, what, what?
[79:48.72]Bro, you're killing it.
[79:49.62]Thanks.
[79:49.88]Look into the camera and say, no.
[80:01.23]You got knocked out by a team on a blimp.
[80:02.87]Oh, Shroud dead.
[80:03.99]By Dr. Lupo.
[80:04.73]He's pretty good.
[80:05.31]Oh, Stans took down Shroud.
[80:06.41]He's not going to stop talking about that for six months.
[80:12.66]Wubby's going to get a headshot, Ryder.
[80:14.56]Yeah, I'm watching too.
[80:15.46]Check it out.
[80:17.04]Bingo, Ryder headshot.
[80:18.32]Oh!
[80:19.02]Oh!
[80:24.05]Ooh, Taric is not missing.
[80:27.45]Good recovery.
[80:28.69]Yeah, those types of players are good at not missing.
[80:35.16]Just kidding.
[80:35.48]He's starting to miss.
[80:42.69]People think that I'm cursing this team.
[80:47.36]No.
[80:48.14]It's possible.
[80:49.08]Let me tell you, the problem's not you.
[80:53.34]I honestly wish it was.
[80:54.46]Taric is so good.
[81:08.07]Mango down, Moki down, Valkyrae down.
[81:11.23]Oh, I think Valkyrae's on Mango's team, which is such a funny crossover.
[81:15.77]Shroud's team is dipping.
[81:18.45]Is XQC still live?
[81:19.29]I want to watch XQC stream.
[81:21.06]Yeah, I think US still live.
[81:26.70]I feel like I'm just watching Twitch right now, just going through the Fortnite channel.
[81:29.94]I know.
[81:34.06]They're all playing Fortnite.
[81:36.26]Yeah, this is awesome.
[81:39.33]Here we go, alright.
[81:50.54]You should do a magic trick while we wait.
[81:52.52]I don't think I have the availability to do that.
[81:55.98]I could.
[82:03.99]I'll be right back.
[82:04.81]I'm gonna do a magic trick for everybody.
[82:05.91]I'll be right back.
[82:07.29]Wait, what?
[82:09.50]He changed his mind.
[82:11.46]He should have been firm with the chat.
[82:13.28]He said, I don't have the availability for that.
[82:14.68]I'll be right back.
[82:18.34]Dad, can we go to McDonald's, please?
[82:19.62]He's like, no.
[82:21.08]Five seconds later, yeah, let's get in the car.
[82:22.82]Yeah, I'll go.
[82:24.26]You've been good.
[82:27.72]Someone's in Jerma responds to chat messages like they're work emails.
[82:44.20]His stream title is just playing Fortnite.
[82:46.32]I'm not kidding.
[82:47.76]Who?
[82:48.74]Jeremiah.
[82:58.48]This guy's a leather banana.
[83:00.46]I don't like that.
[83:01.28]I don't like even it being called that.
[83:03.71]Sexual.
[83:33.31]You play Minecraft, right, Sepnap?
[83:35.45]Yeah.
[83:36.51]Do you still enjoy it these days as much as you used to when you got into it?
[83:42.29]I think now these days, I'm much more reliant on, like, I need to be playing with my friends.
[83:46.50]Before, I used to, like, sweat Minecraft.
[83:49.48]I was just playing just to be, like, good.
[83:53.34]So now it's more social.
[83:54.22]Yeah, it's more social.
[83:55.24]Like, if your friends don't want to play, you're probably not playing.
[83:57.40]Yeah, exactly.
[83:59.38]That's why I don't play CSGO.
[84:00.42]We're the same.
[84:02.14]Oh god, I played so much CSGO.
[84:05.70]All my friends switched to Valorant and I was like, I can't, I guess I'm playing Valorant now, which is fine.
[84:11.10]But I missed the AK-47.
[84:11.98]Yeah.
[84:15.28]I just miss cracking cases, honestly.
[84:19.02]If they would just put opening cases in Valorant, I would have nothing left in Counter-Strike I missed.
[84:25.57]Okay, I'm back.
[84:26.69]I like Counter-Strike's movement.
[84:28.19]Got a little trick for you here.
[84:29.39]Valorant feels a little clunky.
[84:31.64]But Valorant... I actually enjoy Valorant more overall.
[84:35.62]Just a quick one?
[84:37.62]Yeah, I agree with that.
[84:39.86]I think pretty much.
[84:41.40]I like that Counter-Strike rewards you for being good at b-hopping.
[84:45.19]My hands are so greasy.
[84:46.03]Instead of making b-hopping not a thing.
[84:49.77]Yeah.
[84:50.83]I also think that they made Counter-Strafing...
[84:54.25]not a thing.
[84:54.89]So it's like, it's like bad.
[84:57.05]Like you can't, there's no, there's no jiggle peaking, right?
[85:00.24]I've met like in CS go, like you can jiggle, pick a corner and just like tap heads and Valorant.
[85:05.72]It's not as.
[85:06.82]Yeah.
[85:07.88]And Valorant, you can just let go of the movement key and it you're accurate.
[85:11.66]The same speed is if you counter straight.
[85:13.40]Yeah.
[85:13.58]When I jiggle in Valorant, I feel like I'm getting made fun of like in a Discord or somewhere.
[85:17.72]Look at this guy.
[85:20.60]What is, what is it?
[85:21.20]What do you think he's doing?
[85:22.38]He's playing the wrong game.
[85:26.65]You play Valorant a lot, Satbamp?
[85:28.83]Yeah, I do.
[85:29.83]What's your rank?
[85:31.01]Diamond 3, Diamond 2.
[85:32.42]Oh, he's a gamer!
[85:34.36]Yes, sir.
[85:35.26]Me too.
[85:35.62]I'm also that.
[85:36.52]I'm actually Immortal 2026.
[85:39.86]We should play.
[85:41.58]I think I was D3 at the end of the season, and I think I'm D2 right now.
[85:46.00]I haven't played much.
[85:46.68]I haven't been home for the entire last month.
[85:50.12]We can get our ego up after this, play some Valorant.
[85:53.60]Yeah.
[85:55.26]Alright guys.
[85:56.30]That's a game I win at.
[85:57.90]I'd like for you guys to make a quick U-turn over to my stream for a second.
[86:01.96]Yeah, I can do that.
[86:03.29]You got it open?
[86:04.07]It's cracking.
[86:05.29]Let's see.
[86:08.43]I'd like to show you.
[86:09.67]I got two hands here.
[86:11.11]Holding a penny.
[86:12.34]You can see.
[86:12.68]Two hands.
[86:14.30]This hand has nothing in it.
[86:15.02]Let's just go ahead and make sure there's no strings there.
[86:18.53]No strings?
[86:18.89]Yeah, I'm on you.
[86:20.03]I'm on you.
[86:20.33]No strings at all?
[86:21.93]And if we could turn that penny, it'd be nice if we could turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it?
[86:25.69]That'd be pretty cool.
[86:29.25]It'd be nice if we could turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it?
[86:31.63]Oh, shit.
[86:32.91]That was kind of clean.
[86:34.91]50x?
[86:35.12]Yeah, that's a 50x.
[86:37.92]50x on... Whoa.
[86:41.12]On Might of Ra?
[86:41.82]Might of Ra?
[86:47.02]This stream sucks.
[86:50.28]uh swag yeah no I I know a little bit of magic why do you stream you could just do that like a hundred more times and you'd be set it's exponential if it keeps doubling would you like to know how to do it would you like me to do the thing where the guy doesn't have the whole TV show about all the uh magic the mask magician yeah oh that show is so awesome you know magicians were pissed about that really yeah yeah yeah that guy was in like a lot of trouble
[87:20.27]I like the idea of like a large group of magicians crossing their arms.
[87:30.75]I'm going to make your wife disappear.
[87:34.40]So if you guys want to like, you know, impress your friends and stuff, you have to open with like the fun line of gosh, man, that stock market.
[87:42.66]Don't you wish you could, you know, buy a stock or a security and have it go up by 50x?
[87:47.39]Like, you start with that, like, you know, corny shit.
[87:49.59]And then they go, whoa, they lean in, they get really curious.
[87:52.85]And then what you say is, you say, I've got a penny here.
[87:55.96]And what you've got, you do have a penny.
[87:57.38]But what you also have is you have the two quarters here as well.
[88:00.37]The two quarters sit, is that perpendicular?
[88:03.09]What is that?
[88:03.77]Oh, I see, yeah, perpendicular.
[88:04.91]That's correct.
[88:06.03]So you make, it blocks everything, especially, it's like, how could you even hold those quarters there?
[88:11.05]Show them the other hand.
[88:13.21]And then say, excuse me, you, you in the audience, excuse me.
[88:16.65]Hey, give shit, hey, give shit.
[88:19.55]Would you like to buy one cent in my new stock here?
[88:22.96]And then they go, oh, of course I would.
[88:24.36]So in this context, really quick, just so I can clarify, I'm trying to learn.
[88:27.32]So you're already on stage as a magician.
[88:30.15]Yes.
[88:31.82]Got it.
[88:34.36]Okay.
[88:35.48]Okay, so what we do is you take your thumb, raise the bottom of the penny, slide it underneath the second quarter, grip, pull with the other hand, hide it behind the quarter.
[88:50.94]Oh, let's slide a hand.
[88:54.90]Yeah, that's how you do it.
[88:57.38]You ever do the thing where you put the salt shaker under the napkin?
[89:00.28]And you smash it?
[89:02.88]Yeah, you slide it off the table first, and then you smash it.
[89:06.70]Yeah, that's a good one.
[89:08.04]That's a wow.
[89:09.42]That's a wow factor.
[89:13.66]Okay, so let's try to pick a weapon up this time.
[89:16.28]Yeah, let's try to survive longer than two minutes.
[89:19.89]Yes.
[89:20.83]I feel good about this game, actually.
[89:25.47]You take two turns, your Pokémon rests for two turns, then it comes out with a really big attack.
[89:31.26]Yeah, we got... We're winning this next game.
[89:35.38]Fuck it, I don't care.
[89:36.46]Speak it into the world, bro.
[89:37.65]I'm with you.
[89:38.13]Okay, you want to hear the prediction that's running over here?
[89:44.87]What's that?
[89:46.27]Will I pick up a gun before I die?
[89:50.14]And honestly, like, those odds are not great if you really think about the history.
[89:54.22]Yeah.
[89:54.66]If you're looking at statistics purely, then the odds are not in your favor yet.
[89:57.52]Gambler fallacy, bro.
[89:59.11]It's not like it's going to influence the next event, you know?
[90:02.63]Chat.
[90:04.09]Think about that.
[90:05.99]Temple Tapper, honestly.
[90:12.03]I have two chapsticks.
[90:14.84]Two different flavors.
[90:17.81]Played one game of Fortnite with Sap now, but I got Minecrafters following me.
[90:23.03]What happened to my skin?
[90:24.01]I had a skin that made me look like a sweat, and now I can't find it anywhere.
[90:29.14]Oh, I found it.
[90:30.78]Look, now people are going to be scared of us.
[90:32.44]That's sweat.
[90:34.16]Maybe we should all change skins, because we've sort of trained people to think that we're easy.
[90:38.06]Yeah, they see the Blintziaga, and they're like, ah, alright.
[90:42.40]Kill these fuckers.
[90:44.70]Can they see my level?
[90:47.70]No, I don't think they can.
[90:48.70]They wouldn't spectate you.
[90:50.58]Yeah.
[90:50.82]Alright, but not in the game.
[90:52.10]They don't go, look, level one, get them.
[90:53.56]I don't think a single person has been able to spectate you yet, though.
[90:57.79]Any of us.
[90:59.35]That is true.
[91:00.19]I didn't think about that.
[91:01.57]There's just nothing to watch for any of us.
[91:03.89]Alright, I got my sweat costume on.
[91:05.79]People are probably like, yo, where are these guys?
[91:07.73]Are they even here?
[91:10.02]Do they go home?
[91:11.48]Yeah, yeah.
[91:12.38]It's true.
[91:13.80]It's true.
[91:18.67]What?
[91:21.97]You see Ludwig's announcement?
[91:24.09]Wait, what did he do?
[91:24.91]Winning team all gets a $1,000 massage chair delivered to their home.
[91:29.12]Alright guys, come on.
[91:29.78]We gotta quit fucking around now.
[91:30.74]If we win the rest of them, we have a chance.
[91:33.06]It's true.
[91:34.46]We have two more matches.
[91:36.30]We have three, right?
[91:37.80]No, they got rid of the fifth one, so we have two.
[91:39.54]Oh my god.
[91:41.57]I know.
[91:42.51]Even if we win the next two, I don't even think we could win.
[91:45.11]We have to kill half the server.
[91:48.89]I wouldn't put it past us, though.
[91:49.93]We have that in us.
[91:51.03]Why can't I buy this V-Box?
[91:52.01]I think we do have it in us.
[91:53.15]We've actually gotten kind of... It's been a little... It's been a little rough where we've landed.
[91:59.61]Yeah, what the fuck?
[92:00.25]Oh, I'm so mad.
[92:01.01]I can't believe it.
[92:01.71]I can't wait to be diving.
[92:05.05]Look over and diving right next to me at the exact same speed as Shroud.
[92:10.04]He just winks at you.
[92:11.12]Yeah, just like, oh.
[92:12.26]Uh-oh.
[92:15.53]Okay, if that happens, I'm just telling you guys, I'm going to pop a parachute.
[92:18.55]And I'm just going, I'm just floating him to somewhere else.
[92:21.11]He's just abandoning us.
[92:22.19]Mr. President goes to the Fallout shelter.
[92:24.59]I know Shroud's skin now, so I can determine if it's him.
[92:35.18]I think I'll actually beat that prediction, though.
[92:37.52]I think I'll get a gun before dying this time.
[92:43.51]We have such a cool squad too.
[92:44.77]We could do so much fun.
[92:45.55]We could get in the car.
[92:46.43]We could go jump around the buildings and stuff.
[92:47.91]Like, come on.
[92:48.85]This is such a cool squad.
[92:50.74]That's what I'm saying.
[92:52.50]Trying to have a goddamn Wonder Years episode with my boys.
[92:59.86]I never finished that show.
[93:00.86]I need to finish that.
[93:03.58]I remember it was on Netflix and I grinded it.
[93:06.69]I watched it.
[93:11.45]Why was that show so good?
[93:15.76]That's a really good question.
[93:18.32]I remember it being insanely good when I was watching it.
[93:21.76]Wait, what show?
[93:23.22]Wonder Years.
[93:24.48]It was a good show.
[93:28.53]Is American coming of age just hit the sweet spot in our brains, maybe?
[93:36.87]Well, that show was... His brother had a mullet.
[93:39.51]That was huge.
[93:39.87]How long was that show on the air?
[93:41.31]I feel like it was on for a really long time.
[93:44.88]Alright, we got the game three code.
[93:46.10]Alright, let's get involved.
[93:48.34]Alright, this is our game.
[93:54.82]I am trying so hard.
[93:58.86]Everyone ready up, including you, Jerma.
[94:00.46]Yep, yep, I know, I was waiting for it.
[94:09.92]I want the massage chair.
[94:12.16]That would be, I mean, kind of cool.
[94:13.28]I'm just going to buy one with the company card, even if we lose.
[94:18.90]I don't give a shit.
[94:19.72]I'm charging Ludwig's card $1,000 for a massage chair, regardless.
[94:24.23]If we drop next to Shroud this match, I am buying a massage chair on company dime.
[94:28.95]In between the match.
[94:30.23]Yes.
[94:32.91]We put it on the podcast next week.
[94:34.43]We call it a business expense.
[94:35.61]This is mogul moves.
[94:40.66]Just tell him he ordered an extra three accidentally or something.
[94:44.14]Yeah, my bad, bro.
[94:45.38]Oh, shit.
[94:47.54]That would be for you three.
[94:48.39]I don't deserve one.
[94:50.55]No, you deserve one.
[94:53.15]No, you deserve one.
[94:53.75]What the hell?
[94:54.69]Get that mentality up.
[94:55.51]I don't want to hear that.
[94:56.59]Yeah, come on.
[94:59.15]It doesn't matter because we're just going to win it anyways, but on the off chance we don't, we're coming.
[95:03.75]Right, yeah.
[95:04.86]Even if we do win, I'm buying a second one to let him know that his tournament was bad.
[95:09.78]Nick, Myth is in our house.
[95:12.10]Pushing for compliments, somebody said.
[95:13.70]Even though I just pulled up his stream.
[95:17.99]Ludwig's stream.
[95:19.63]Should we go ask him for help?
[95:22.17]He hops on my setup?
[95:23.27]No, bro.
[95:23.75]Hop on my fucking PC, please.
[95:29.89]Alright, let's do it.
[95:31.11]We're going to do it this time.
[95:32.05]It's going to be good.
[95:33.41]We are going to be golden.
[95:34.57]It's going to be awesome.
[95:40.28]You sound like you're about to go on the stage for the talent show.
[95:44.08]To do my magic tricks?
[95:45.28]I feel so good right now.
[95:46.26]We're going to be electric.
[95:48.30]I got the coin trick.
[95:51.38]The crowd can't even see the types of coins you're holding.
[95:53.71]It's so far away.
[95:55.97]What is that?
[96:02.57]my go-to magic trick was uh that one from you guys you ever seen now you see me yes there's the the intro scene where he like flips the deck of cards and he's like did you see that card and he pulls it out and the one the audience all saw that was my go-to I my brain can't even remember half that movie my that movie is just a trailer of people like throwing cards at each other that that's now you see me too oh what's the one where they rob the they rob the bank

[97:05.81]My guess is 2013.
[97:10.70]Maybe 2012.
[97:11.34]That's a good guess.
[97:14.96]Now you see me.
[97:16.56]2013 on the dot.
[97:19.00]Let's fucking go.

[97:27.03]It was a fun watch.
[97:29.35]Morgan Freeman's in it.
[97:33.29]Oh, yeah, Morgan Freeman is in that movie.
[97:34.66]Don't they, like, witcheroo him where he's, like, standing somewhere and then they, like, teleport him or something somewhere else?
[97:39.72]Yeah, at one point they put him in, like, a jail cell at one point.
[97:42.58]It's kind of crazy.
[97:43.23]It was a good watch.

[99:44.75]If Shroud is here, I'm going to lose it.
[99:46.27]Ludwig is already spectating us.
[99:47.69]I don't like that.
[99:48.69]Yeah.
[99:51.07]I think we're far away from Chalker's Speedway.
[99:52.59]I hope not.
[99:55.59]I don't see anyone.
[99:56.33]I don't see anyone.
[99:58.09]We have one person who's with us.
[100:01.53]There's one person.
[100:04.29]They might drop early, though.
[100:08.18]Is it one person or a team?
[100:10.05]It has to be a team.
[100:10.71]No one would drop alone.
[100:11.74]Yeah, we have a team with us.
[100:12.44]We have a team with us.
[100:13.04]Alright, we have to fuck them up.
[100:15.72]Do we want to fight or do we want to run?
[100:20.14]We're going to fight.
[100:21.72]Fuck it, we're fighting.
[100:23.00]Okay.
[100:23.98]This has worked for us every time, so I mean, whatever.

[100:39.82]I'm about to take damage.
[100:42.46]I'm getting a gun.
[100:43.48]I'm getting a gun to come into you.
[100:45.12]Uh, sap map.
[100:46.58]Sounds good.
[100:48.02]I'm- I need this.
[100:50.46]There's a guy on the hill, on... Okay, over there, on that side.
[100:55.85]Yo, can you grab that keg that's right there?
[100:57.03]Is that a keg?
[100:58.75]I need a fucking gun.
[101:00.13]No, this is like a, this is a tent.
[101:01.91]It's just over here.
[101:02.57]Alright.
[101:02.93]I'm going to get this chest.
[101:04.49]Jerma, get a fucking gun in your hands.
[101:08.27]Got it.
[101:08.61]Got a gun.
[101:10.25]Daily Dose is in a radius, so.
[101:13.12]Yeah, Daily Dose's team is in our, in our thing.
[101:17.62]Hey, this is, this is looking pretty good, boys.
[101:19.48]I like it so far.
[101:20.50]Alright.
[101:23.38]So what else, what else am I looking for here?
[101:24.92]Ammo, weapons?
[101:26.41]Yeah.
[101:27.01]All of the above.
[101:27.59]You want to get full shield, you want to get a good assault rifle that's not gray, and you're pretty much set.
[101:33.89]Okay.
[101:34.15]Alright.
[101:35.25]I got heals, I think.
[101:36.03]I have six small pots as well.
[101:41.58]Stop doing this.
[101:42.06]I'm going to get a headshot.
[101:45.22]Every gun I've seen is gray.
[101:46.30]Holy shit.
[101:46.68]Eat these, Jerma.
[101:47.60]Eat them?
[101:49.18]You can eat two.
[101:50.86]I got many.
[101:51.26]We'll fill you up to 50.
[101:52.86]Yeah.
[101:53.44]Let's get that gun.
[101:58.89]What about the tire?
[101:59.55]I don't want this.
[102:02.09]What did I just do?
[102:03.45]I just threw it like an ape.
[102:04.88]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[102:07.22]Okay.
[102:08.60]Alright, the zone's kind of far.
[102:10.96]Do you guys want to start?
[102:11.80]Oh, we have cars, actually.
[102:13.08]Yeah, I think we just rely on the car and we don't engage people yet.
[102:17.26]Yeah, we should stay the fuck away from everyone.
[102:20.85]We should definitely grab as much...
[102:23.89]health and shield as we can.
[102:25.52]For sure.
[102:27.10]I have, uh, I have, what's it called?
[102:29.66]Splash.
[102:30.20]I could throw it at everyone.
[102:31.24]I've got six minis.
[102:34.83]I don't know why I went in the dumpster.
[102:38.61]It's okay.
[102:42.93]No, I thought I was dead, dude.
[102:44.05]I was like, what the fuck?
[102:44.85]Somebody, like, sniped me.
[102:45.86]It was terrifying.
[102:47.40]Yeah, you transported, right?
[102:48.96]Yeah, I jumped off a building and went in the dump.
[102:50.86]I'm so sorry.
[102:51.42]I just screamed.
[102:51.88]No, it's okay.
[102:53.74]It's not the energy.
[102:54.86]It got my adrenaline up, and that's gonna help me aim.
[103:00.73]I'm so... I'm too neurotic to play this game.
[103:04.81]I think we're pretty mentally beaten, you know?
[103:07.91]So we gotta... It's very fair.
[103:10.77]It feels good to actually run around and shit.
[103:14.89]Seriously.
[103:15.31]Yeah, I didn't know this game had controls.
[103:17.83]I gotta do this before we... Alright, cool.
[103:21.59]Oh my god, we're far away from that, aren't we?
[103:23.17]Yeah, we should start cranking it that way.
[103:28.19]You're pretty far, Nick.
[103:29.40]Yeah, I'm coming.
[103:33.68]Is there a reason why Batman is on the screen right now blinking?
[103:38.15]Yeah, that's like... On the map, there's a yellow circle.
[103:43.23]That's where he is.
[103:44.79]Shock grenades are big.
[103:45.69]That car's us.
[103:47.11]That's Nick.
[103:47.95]Alright, we picked a good place to drop this time.
[103:55.82]My loot is pretty trash.
[103:57.68]I got some minis up here.
[103:58.94]Someone wants to grab those.
[103:59.78]I have no space.
[104:01.48]We need to get like a keg would be really nice so we can all get up to 100 shield.
[104:05.42]I can splash us.
[104:06.94]Alright, let's meet up in this house and let's splash.
[104:09.92]Okay.
[104:10.22]There's a blimp here so be careful of that.
[104:11.61]There might be people on it.
[104:16.17]Let's see.
[104:16.65]Is there a car?
[104:20.17]Here, let's splash up right here.
[104:21.19]I don't see anybody in the blimp.
[104:27.53]So is the smart thing to do just to yell out the number at the top of the screen?
[104:31.49]Yeah, that's pretty good.
[104:32.55]There's also 319.
[104:33.59]That works.
[104:34.75]Like, when people shoot, there's a red little thing that pops up on it.
[104:38.19]Wait, you say there's people 319?
[104:42.27]No, that was a dummy call out.
[104:44.11]Oh, okay.
[104:47.77]Did no one go to this blimp?
[104:48.75]I'm kind of scared to go to this blimp and loot it.
[104:51.47]But this town looks unlooted below it.
[104:54.57]We also don't have a lot of time.
[104:57.24]Yeah, but we can use the... We should go to the Blimp.
[104:59.24]Let's loot the Blimp.
[104:59.84]Because we can use the Blimp to fly into the zone.
[105:06.08]Frames?
[105:06.38]Uh-oh.
[105:08.01]Hope not.
[105:08.95]Anyone have... Can you hold smalls?
[105:10.09]Sandap, can you hold small pots?
[105:12.79]I got six already.
[105:13.91]Any big?
[105:14.71]Anyone hold that big?
[105:15.71]Actually, I can eat the big.
[105:17.68]I would eat it.
[105:19.36]I'll hold it.
[105:20.10]Dude, there's so much loot in this town.
[105:21.94]Let's loot this town and then use the blimp.
[105:25.36]This chest is open.
[105:26.54]Yep, that's true.
[105:27.98]Could be a team here.
[105:29.16]I'm going over here.
[105:29.84]I'm going on the blimp.
[105:32.89]I'm going to go with you.
[105:34.13]I'm kind of scared to go in it.
[105:35.51]Maybe I'll take a little gander.
[105:37.03]Yeah, this is looted.
[105:38.37]I'm just going to stay on top of the blimp.
[105:40.19]I'm actually going to use the blimp to glide out.
[105:43.55]That's a call.
[105:44.03]Are we holding up?
[105:46.26]Yeah, and then we're just going to fly away using the propeller things.
[105:50.26]I bet the team that was here already left.
[105:51.88]Yeah, I think they did as well.
[105:54.12]I think we should just be pussies and just stay on the edge of the zone.
[105:58.78]Yeah.
[105:59.55]Oh shit, we got to go now.
[106:00.43]Oh my god, it's coming at us.
[106:01.75]It's not going to hurt too bad, but yeah.
[106:03.79]I'm already in.
[106:07.87]I'm right on you.
[106:09.79]Okay, there's a blimp right here.
[106:10.71]Probably guaranteed a team on it, so stay away from that.
[106:13.53]There's some people in there.
[106:14.47]We should stay away from Tilted in general.
[106:15.93]That's gonna be fucking terrible.
[106:17.66]We should just keep looting these outer little things, like this little hut and shit.
[106:26.12]There's still 60 people alive, bro.
[106:27.74]There's a green AUG in here, which is pretty nice.
[106:29.40]Someone wants that.
[106:30.98]I will need that.
[106:33.10]Should I heal a little bit?
[106:34.61]Can I take this big?
[106:36.17]Yep.
[106:37.26]When we get safe, he can heal up, but you shouldn't really need to because you can't heal with a bandage and it's a waste of a medkit.
[106:43.74]There's mushrooms over here on my ping if you want to get your shield finished off.
[106:50.92]Okay, so the teams that are in Tilted are going to start moving towards us because of the next circle, so we should probably run like complete outskirts.
[106:56.38]Like, let's go this way.
[106:57.96]Oh, there's a team of people fighting in front of us.
[106:59.66]There's a fucking tank.
[107:00.56]Oh, no, it's a battle bus.
[107:01.96]Oh, shit.
[107:02.32]Battle bus?
[107:03.35]Yeah, we should stay the fuck away from that.
[107:04.79]I do have a rocket.
[107:05.59]I have three purple rockets.
[107:06.73]No, we shouldn't fight on a thing.
[107:08.65]In the... I can kill one.
[107:11.67]Knocked.
[107:12.52]Nice, nice.
[107:13.18]Good job.
[107:14.36]Finish him.
[107:14.78]Nice.
[107:15.02]We got killed.
[107:15.56]We did it.
[107:16.38]We did it.
[107:16.86]We did it.
[107:17.34]We did it.
[107:20.70]I didn't see anything.
[107:21.36]I was spraying myself in the face.
[107:24.36]You're doing your job.
[107:25.68]That player made a call out where we are, so we should probably reposition.
[107:29.01]Do you think the rest of the team is right here?
[107:33.95]I see over here.
[107:35.13]Wait, a car just turned on right next to me.
[107:37.35]Guy jumping?
[107:38.27]Okay, I think we're getting run up on and done up on.
[107:41.91]Careful.
[107:42.34]Oh, shit.
[107:42.74]I'm getting hit.
[107:43.46]There's a guy right here in front of me.
[107:48.26]Shielding.
[107:49.53]I'm coming to you.
[107:50.05]I'm gonna fight with you.
[107:51.03]I'm backing up here.
[107:51.71]I don't really like this.
[107:53.09]Maybe we just go back where we came from.
[107:59.59]Right fire.
[108:02.23]Covering fire.
[108:04.00]Right there on my ping.
[108:05.30]He's coming behind us.
[108:06.36]He's flanking.
[108:07.40]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:09.60]On us, on us, on us.
[108:11.66]I don't even know.
[108:13.02]Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.
[108:15.00]Stay alive.
[108:18.76]I want you to stay all the way to the end, baby.
[108:20.92]That was XQC.
[108:22.90]Of course.
[108:26.86]Don't even engage.
[108:27.54]Just stay alive.
[108:28.34]Get us towards the end.
[108:29.32]I think we have so many meds on us.
[108:34.65]We have so many meds on us that you can stay in the storm.
[108:37.51]There's a guy right there.
[108:41.83]I need to pause my fucking Spotify.
[108:44.79]You're like the little brother that their mother forced them to play with their older brother.
[108:49.99]I mean, yeah, this is the first... Okay, I don't even know what the weapons distances are.
[108:59.98]It's fun, but... Because they're going to dip right now, and then you have a bunch of heals.
[109:07.53]I hope they... Okay.
[109:08.91]Okay.
[109:10.05]As long as they didn't take them all.
[109:11.81]Turn the shadows off help?
[109:19.15]Why am I dropping frames?
[109:19.99]That's fucking annoying.
[109:20.65]I'm done with this tree.
[109:25.38]Hey, all you gotta do is stay alive.
[109:28.58]Simple enough.
[109:29.70]Alright, storm coming in.
[109:43.51]There's no fucking heals, holy shit.
[109:46.72]Hold on, the guy- Oh, that was so swag.
[109:49.92]That was the most swag thing I've ever seen.
[109:51.62]Holy shit, that was pretty cool.
[109:56.30]You got a great circle.
[110:00.90]Dude, holy shit.
[110:01.74]If you actually get those res' off, this is doable.
[110:05.91]I don't know, the only- fuck, the only one is there.
[110:08.41]It's gonna be tough.
[110:09.15]Reboot van.
[110:13.94]Yeah, when you die, you drop a little card, and you go to the van, and you can redeploy us.
[110:18.84]But you gotta collect the card, which you just did.
[110:20.48]Yeah, the frames are dropping, because I went back to the original ingest server a week ago, and now it's having problems again.
[110:27.07]Hooray!
[110:28.31]That's fucking fantastic.
[110:31.09]So, I'm just gonna go to the other one and never turn back.
[110:33.99]You gotta be worried about getting fucking sniped from someone.
[110:37.51]There's so many players alive.
[110:38.95]One, like, has to be near you.
[110:40.91]Yeah, I know.
[110:47.09]Hopefully I can catch someone coming into the circle or something.
[110:50.19]So if you get to that van, you can revive everybody?
[110:54.13]Wait, can I get in that battle bus?
[110:56.71]Oh, player, you saw one.
[110:58.23]Yeah, yeah.
[111:03.80]The bus is probably out of gas if it's just sitting there.
[111:10.52]Ooh.
[111:11.26]I can maybe steal some kills here.
[111:15.95]Ooh, nice.
[111:16.65]Yes, sir.
[111:19.15]That's X, bro.
[111:22.55]Uh-oh.
[111:24.51]The party bus.
[111:25.11]What the fuck just happened?
[111:32.47]Oh, shit.
[111:32.71]I'm on fire.
[111:33.09]What the fuck?
[111:36.35]Yes, sir.
[111:36.99]That was ridiculous.
[111:37.83]What just happened?
[111:39.31]Someone blew it up with, I think, a rocket.
[111:41.86]X is probably still downed on that rocket.
[111:43.42]No, no.
[111:43.90]His friends are picking him up for sure.
[111:46.69]Yep.
[111:47.45]Should I do this?
[111:48.97]No, no, no, no, no.
[111:49.55]I think you're in a good spot.
[111:52.07]Holy shit.
[111:54.48]No!
[111:55.14]Dude, he flicked on you.
[111:56.64]How do you see me there?
[111:57.66]That's crazy.
[111:58.56]Way better.
[111:59.10]Way better this time, boys.
[111:59.96]Wow.
[112:01.92]Alright, I'm reporting him.
[112:06.93]That's really the only option, yeah.
[112:09.37]Dude, oh my... XQC Shroud, XQC Shroud.
[112:12.05]Is that what it was?
[112:12.83]Or no, XQC Shroud, Shroud XQC.
[112:15.20]Yeah.
[112:15.74]I guess he knew.
[112:16.32]Maybe he just knew from where I shot him last time.
[112:18.13]He was just waiting, looking for me there.
[112:20.95]I'm going to BRIB one second.
[112:22.25]I'm switching Twitch servers.
[112:24.01]All good.
[112:24.62]Look, that was a lot better.
[112:25.54]We got... I'm switching servers.
[112:27.78]I'm switching servers.
[112:28.80]Stream's going to go off for 30 seconds.
[112:29.98]I'll be right back.
[112:45.64]Okay, I'm back.
[112:50.47]You got a gun, Jerma, and that's huge.
[112:51.75]That means you're improving?
[112:52.75]That's huge.
[112:53.81]Oh, Punz is down.
[112:55.95]Oh, Connor's down.
[112:57.47]Oh, I think that's it for them.
[112:59.03]Emi's about to go down too.
[113:00.43]Yep.
[113:00.89]It's all up to George.
[113:02.90]He's me, man.
[113:04.16]Alright, so we're not 19th.
[113:07.22]No, we are far from it.
[113:09.04]Us getting two kills that game probably solidified us not last.
[113:16.05]Which I can't stress this enough for you, Dermot.
[113:17.73]That is enormous when you live with the guy running the tournament.
[113:21.77]He's just going to be such a pain in my ass about this.
[113:27.24]Why?
[113:27.36]What do you mean?
[113:29.52]Well, Ludwig is a very competitive person.
[113:32.32]And I kind of made a big deal about the Fortnite tournament from last week.
[113:38.68]And he's just going to rub it in.
[113:44.26]And he's too strong, so I can't... I can't... Is Ludwig playing in this tournament?
[113:48.69]No, he's just commentating.
[113:49.81]Oh, okay.
[113:51.09]He did last time.
[113:52.57]He played and then hosted it, but I think that's too much, which is understandable.
[113:55.95]Yeah, he's spectating that much, too.
[113:58.99]Is there going to be one next week as well?
[114:00.90]Every Monday.
[114:02.16]Every Monday.
[114:03.00]Until he decides not to do them anymore.
[114:08.40]He really did pick a terrible day, huh, Anthony?
[114:10.58]Yeah.
[114:11.74]second worst stream wait refresh I'm back no more dropped frames I'm never going back to that server again what right when I said it are you kidding me at a specific time ludwig lunday then he adds the Fortnite event why is he going past it I guess I guess drum shotgun is that good if he's like passing up a purple uh auto shotgun it is the drum it's like drum over any other shotgun
[114:43.63]Carl seems really deep into this.
[114:47.83]What the fuck?
[114:49.77]Why did it get worse?
[114:53.79]Oh my god, my internet's about to go off.
[115:04.80]Am I still in the call with you guys?
[115:06.78]Yeah.
[115:07.00]Yeah, yeah.
[115:09.10]Dude, my connections to the Twitch servers are fucking awful right now.
[115:14.61]Wait, Carl's... Are you guys watching Carl?
[115:16.25]Like, his team could just annihilate the scene.
[115:18.29]Yeah, yeah, this is... They're set.
[115:21.47]If I was them, I would just open fire on these guys.
[115:23.44]I wonder who's IGL-ing.
[115:26.62]Who's telling them to hold back?
[115:28.58]I don't know.
[115:29.58]I guess the only reason... Yeah, if it was... This is the thing that's the most annoying thing about the Twitch server is shit.
[115:34.48]If this was my internet, I would be... That call would be all robotic.
[115:39.03]What the fuck?
[115:41.41]Why does Twitch hate my connection coming in?
[115:45.70]It's fucking annoying.
[115:46.40]I'll be right back one more time.
[116:09.48]Dude, I... I cannot connect to Twitch.
[116:14.61]My, my internet is perfect.
[116:17.75]Like, what the fuck?
[116:21.19]I don't understand why this keeps happening.
[116:23.66]I cannot connect to Twitch's, the Twitch's servers are junk for me.
[116:27.54]But I'm in the game, my internet's fine.
[116:29.68]Um, listen.
[116:33.12]Oh, call gets shot out of the sky!
[116:35.14]Look at this.
[116:36.09]Oh, it's a 4v1.
[116:36.51]Oh no.
[116:37.29]Unreal.
[116:39.17]My call's not robotic, it's only connecting to Twitch.
[116:42.13]What the fuck?
[116:44.18]I'm trying something else.
[116:45.02]I'll be right back.
[116:51.82]Okay, let's try this.
[116:52.58]Guys, I don't fucking get it.
[117:02.35]Murdered out.
[117:03.61]Okay.
[117:05.78]When this is over, I'm muting Ludwig, I'm deleting his phone number, and I'm queuing Valorant to feel something good.
[117:09.74]Dude, well, let's just move out.
[117:12.80]I'm tired.
[117:14.18]I'm weary.
[117:16.25]Okay.
[117:17.27]So, I'm just, like, routing my traffic.
[117:20.99]I don't know why Twitch hates my connection so much sometimes.
[117:28.15]But I went to three or four different servers.
[117:32.46]What the fuck is happening?
[117:35.25]Alright, we're good.
[117:35.69]Alright, I'm good to go.
[117:38.52]I'm back.
[117:39.80]Yes, sir.
[117:40.46]They couldn't hold us down forever.
[117:42.82]That was better, though.
[117:43.46]That was better.
[117:43.82]We got one more?
[117:45.30]Yeah, we got one more.
[117:47.22]Last game.
[117:48.04]I kind of want there just to be five.
[117:49.37]Dude, right?
[117:54.17]The false start at the beginning was... Well, it was great for us.
[117:58.29]I won't lie.
[117:59.17]Yeah.
[118:07.88]Yeah, it's fixed now.
[118:08.58]Cool.
[118:13.24]Yeah, so I have no idea why that keeps happening.
[118:16.08]Randomly, for no reason, my data coming in through Twitch from Vegas, it just hates it, and it just kills me.
[118:24.97]I jump around to like five different servers, and it's like, okay, here you go, you're fine.
[118:28.25]Literally, as if the problem never existed.
[118:32.05]None of my internet goes down, I'm at full speed, full speed ahead, nothing, I don't get it.
[118:38.63]You got zero viewers?
[118:39.47]Shut up!
[118:47.66]Laying in bed.
[118:50.54]Can I be honest?
[118:51.24]I've gotten a Battle Royale and PUBG Mobile before.
[118:54.70]Oh, really?
[118:55.06]You played two?
[118:57.05]When it first came out in high school, I played it a little bit when I was in class.
[119:00.59]That's hype.
[119:01.37]How old are you?
[119:04.78]uh 21. oh my god I'm 10 years older than you kids had it so good you know what I did we played psp Grand Theft Auto liberty city stories and we wi-fi like multiplayered I shot my friend jfk style out of a convertible with a sniper rifle on a psp it's actually my greatest gaming achievement to this day
[119:24.62]You say that you're 10 years older.
[119:27.12]Got some news for you.
[119:27.90]I am the middle bear here, huh?
[119:32.20]Super Mario Brothers released for the regular Nintendo.
[119:36.28]That's fucked up.
[119:38.20]Yeah, I was in Modern Warfare 2 land in high school.
[119:42.26]My father would always come over and say, hey, get me six lives and get me to the last boss.
[119:45.89]And I'll beat it.
[119:46.31]Because we just couldn't do it, me and my siblings.
[119:49.55]So we would spend the whole game trying to get to six lives to get to the last part, the last level where Bowser was.
[119:56.39]And my dad would take the controller and he would beat it as long as we had six lives.
[120:01.41]Why?
[120:02.57]Why was he, why was he, it was like a sweatshop.
[120:06.82]Well, no, he was just, he knew he could beat the game at that point.
[120:11.18]He almost memorized the level, but in case he died three or four times, he didn't want to upset his children.
[120:15.38]What if he didn't do it?
[120:16.06]Anthony, you ready?
[120:17.24]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[120:20.27]That is extremely funny.
[120:21.81]How many PUBG Mobile victory royales under your belt?
[120:25.80]Oh, God, I don't know.
[120:26.70]Maybe... I feel like whenever I was playing, I was playing against bots, so I got quite a few, but it didn't feel good.
[120:33.60]You know what I mean?
[120:36.50]You know what I want?
[120:37.32]I want PUBG, the actual game, to come back.
[120:39.69]That game, whenever that came out, that was peak PUBG.
[120:43.23]Like, that was one of the most fun I've had on the game.
[120:44.67]It was so fun, yeah.
[120:45.77]It was ridiculous.
[120:46.51]Like, I remember my friends, me and my buddies in high school, the bit was we would just drop Pochinki and then just run it.
[120:52.59]Dropping school?
[120:53.75]Yeah, there was Pochinki, there was school.
[120:55.51]I never dropped school.
[120:56.31]School was too much for me.
[120:57.49]It was just ridiculous.
[120:58.77]Yeah, it's a 10-second game if you land.
[121:01.15]But it was just so fun.
[121:03.07]I think it was showing how fun it was, even though the game was, like, such a buggy piece of shit, we all put up with it because we were like, this is sick.
[121:11.26]Yeah, and still buggy piece of shit to the plane Daisy Daisy was huge.
[121:16.68]Oh my god, dude.
[121:17.51]I love Daisy I love Daisy so much like so so much.
[121:22.41]I used to like play like RP servers and
[121:24.57]I thought the RP servers were more fun because like there's like dedicated zones where you could kill people just like randomly.
[121:31.07]And otherwise you had to like rob them, which was really fun.
[121:33.78]Yeah, that was a real interesting social experiment because people would, that was one of the first times people were just kind of given a piece of just big land and just go for it.
[121:43.30]Oh, you, you, no, no, don't shoot me.
[121:44.52]Don't shoot me.
[121:45.16]Let's talk about this, right?
[121:46.20]Like that would happen.
[121:48.43]It was like a weird, like kind of experiment, which is putting like a hundred, how many people were allowed in a DayZ server?
[121:54.40]I think, like, 50, 60?
[121:55.12]Yeah.
[121:57.40]All I know is I was, like, an absolute menace in that game.
[122:00.00]Like, a menace.
[122:01.18]Were you evil?
[122:02.43]Oh, yeah.
[122:04.55]Like, I would, like, kill people and then, like, eat them and shit.
[122:08.88]Yeah, you could eat them.
[122:09.74]You could cut them up and eat them for food.
[122:11.64]What the fuck?
[122:14.36]Did you say, like, I'm gonna fucking eat you, bro.
[122:17.46]No, no, I was fucked up.
[122:18.56]Like, I would, like, rob two people, tie them up, because you could put them in handcuffs, kill their friend, and, like, make them eat their friend.
[122:24.57]Like, all the most fucked up shit I could do, I would just do it.
[122:28.23]Hey, how's your homie taste, bro?
[122:30.35]I called you a well-rounded individual about 45 minutes ago.
[122:34.08]Yeah.
[122:35.55]Also, I'd also like oh, yeah, that's so funny I would just I would just like like I would just like cuz like it's called like Bambi's like whenever you like fresh spawn.
[122:42.55]So I like- I would like go get geared up like from like what was in Northwest airfield.
[122:46.55]Just get like ridiculously looted go doc-
[122:48.55]Go back down to spawn and just like- like do terrible things to the Bambi's.
[122:54.55]You made them eat each other?
[122:56.00]Like some guy would walk up I'm like: Hey, dude, you're looted. Like I'm like a standing over a corpse and I was like and would just be like- like you're gonna eat this guy now.
[123:06.15]Holy shit.
[123:06.40]That wasn't one where you could like build cars, right? And it was really hard.
[123:08.46]Yeah, if you had a car- and the cars were so buggy like you know many times I'd have like the most gear ever and like we're just driving down a highway and I just die randomly.
[123:17.55]I'm dead. It's like, okay.
[123:20.53]Yeah cars were fun.
[123:21.31]You know, on like a few servers I played on they like coded in building like you could like I built bases and shit.
[123:27.39]It was awesome.
[123:29.98]That was a really cool time in gaming, though.
[123:32.04]It was before a lot of the Battle Royale stuff.
[123:35.64]But people treated it kind of like a VR.
[123:37.67]But it sort of wasn't, but it was.
[123:39.63]Yeah, it was like the proto.
[123:40.69]Because I remember just the only exposure I got to that was watching videos of people, like, just, like, basically not eat other people, but, like, hold people hostage and, like, because you could talk to them and stuff, right?
[123:53.36]Yeah.
[123:54.93]And there were just videos of people interacting with each other.
[123:58.56]When did Rust come out?
[123:59.30]Because Rust did a lot of this stuff too, right?
[124:04.54]I don't remember.
[124:05.14]Is that the one?
[124:06.42]Yeah, DanielSL.
[124:07.42]Those videos are so fucking funny.
[124:10.04]Dude, he's just clicking his mouse.
[124:13.35]Sapnap, when you were in high school, what was the popular Call of Duty game?
[124:17.89]I don't know.
[124:18.25]Whenever I was in high school, I stopped playing COD.
[124:21.17]like that's when that's when I went full pc like I got my pc like I built my pc in like eighth grade and then when I got into high school I just thought I was too good for like cod and Xbox and stuff I was like oh I'm a pc gamer I'm playing college which lines up because when I was in college you were in high school and then I did a lot of whenever
[124:45.77]Because I was a young, impressionable child, I did CSGO gambling.
[124:50.67]Yes, sir.
[124:51.87]The thing was, though, I was really good at it.
[124:54.43]I know you can't be good at gambling, but I was incredibly lucky.
[124:57.97]I won, I'm not even kidding, thousands of dollars, and I cashed it out and just went on a spending spree in high school.
[125:03.07]Like freshman year.
[125:03.77]Oh, my God.
[125:05.95]The sickest thing I ever cracked was a classic knife that I named Larry David SSBM.
[125:11.53]Oh, yeah?
[125:12.69]Did you guys play TF2?
[125:13.19]Were you guys TF2 players?
[125:15.37]I played a very little bit of TF2.
[125:16.85]Like, a few games.
[125:18.07]Okay, where are we cranking this?
[125:19.51]Alright, boys.
[125:20.91]I say... Bro, you guys want to fucking venture?

[125:29.82]It's an early drop, and we gotta let you out.
[125:31.66]Early now?
[125:32.32]Okay.
[125:34.65]While we're in the air flying, I will also say, the way I won, like, one of the gambling things I won on CSGO is I put $5 into a 4K pot and sniped it.
[125:43.77]Like, with a point, it was a .015% chance.
[125:46.11]It was just ridiculous.
[125:48.63]Oh, they're restarting the game?
[125:50.17]Restarting?
[125:52.53]What?

[136:38.97]Yeah, just shoot it.
[136:41.20]Oh, yeah, big pot.
[136:42.32]I missed every shot of this.
[136:44.62]I don't need bullets.
[136:45.64]I need bullets.
[136:46.20]Where do you get bullets?
[136:49.42]Oh, we're okay.
[136:54.41]I need bullets for the gun.
[136:55.49]Someone's going to find us out here in the open just shooting this fucking llama.
[136:59.05]Or is it Keg?
[136:59.57]Alright, come here.
[136:59.99]Everyone come here.

[137:10.42]Oh, shit!
[137:11.22]Oh, fuck!
[137:12.60]Alright, uh, does anybody have any ammo?
[137:13.96]Do you guys have any shotgun ammo?
[137:16.36]Uh, yes, here.
[137:17.52]Yo, I actually have a ludicrous amount of ammo.
[137:19.22]Do you guys have any extra guns I can have?
[137:20.84]All I have is a pistol right now.
[137:21.95]I have a shotgun and a sniper.
[137:23.35]I can give you this.
[137:24.25]Just whoever's got an extra- oh, yeah, I'll take that.
[137:26.03]Alright.

[137:32.26]Alright, let's run.
[137:33.53]Let's go to Greasy.
[137:34.87]Let's go to the Greasy.
[137:36.65]Alright, let's get in the car.
[137:37.91]Can we repair the car?
[137:39.29]We can, but we need to get... It might explode.
[137:41.53]You're right.
[137:41.93]It might explode.
[137:42.35]You're right.
[137:44.01]I'm so glad we got that bomb ass team.
[137:46.11]I'm so glad we got that bomb ass team.
[137:47.49]I can't believe we got out of that shit.
[137:49.96]That was ridiculous.
[137:51.34]Alright, we need to just stay the fuck away from everyone.
[137:54.24]Just do not engage anything.
[137:56.04]In this building.
[137:57.96]Where's the ping not working?
[137:59.86]There's a guy right here!
[138:01.28]I'll find you up.
[138:04.82]Run, run, run, run!
[138:05.56]I'm popping a keg on us!
[138:07.99]Where the fuck are you?
[138:09.95]Where is he?
[138:13.76]Baby, that's all I need.
[138:16.33]We are pinched by like three teams right now.
[138:18.37]I think we go down the hill.
[138:20.21]Down, down, down, down, down, down.
[138:22.49]Oh, somebody got in our car.
[138:23.99]Somebody's in the car?
[138:24.71]Blow the car up.
[138:25.61]Run down the hill.
[138:26.76]I'm following you guys.
[138:27.34]Alright.
[138:28.48]We run down the hill and then we crank it to the left.
[138:32.76]Oh, there's some loot here.
[138:33.52]What the fuck?
[138:34.66]Wait, we just got blessed.
[138:36.83]There's a pickup truck here.
[138:38.47]Hey, we got a truck?
[138:40.21]Guy did pick up our car.
[138:41.19]I'm getting binned.
[138:41.71]I'm getting binned.
[138:42.27]Fishing rod!
[138:43.49]It's probably from the hill, right?
[138:44.39]Oh wait, no.
[138:45.11]It's over there.
[138:46.69]They're fighting.
[138:47.15]They're fighting.
[138:47.55]They're fighting.
[138:49.90]I tagged a motherfucker twice.
[138:50.92]Broke his shield.
[138:51.38]Bro, all I have is grey weapons.
[138:56.54]What the fuck?
[138:57.12]Yeah, I'm fucking pretty starved right now.
[138:59.54]I got a blue weapon.
[139:00.10]Should I give it to somebody that wants to play the game?
[139:03.23]No, it's yours.
[139:04.33]It's yours.
[139:04.73]Just point it at the enemies.
[139:06.01]You own it.
[139:06.41]You own it.
[139:08.90]Oh fuck, I got beamed, I got beamed.
[139:11.02]I need res, I need res.
[139:11.88]Oh guys, we need to get to the fucking, we need to get in the car and get the fuck out.

[139:16.74]Double res, double res, double res.
[139:17.92]Shit, I'm getting hit too.
[139:20.39]Double res, someone's up close with me.
[139:22.11]Coming around, getting shot at.
[139:23.29]Is there a way to get out of here?
[139:24.61]I guess we can just run.
[139:27.21]Behind, yep.
[139:30.13]FLASHBANG!
[139:30.93]GOING OUT!
[139:31.59]FLASHBANG!
[139:33.05]I'M GOING OUT!

[139:41.38]Hold it, hold it!
[139:41.88]OH!
[139:42.72]Oh no, oh no!
[139:43.48]I don't even know who the fuck this person is!
[139:48.20]I don't know who the person is!
[139:49.60]I don't know who the person is!
[139:51.50]That's not last!
[139:52.62]Holy shit...
[139:58.70]Like, why was everywhere we ran, there was just people there?
[140:01.32]I have no idea what's going on in this game.
[140:03.34]Hey, at least we thirsted one of those people.
[140:04.92]Yes, sir!
[140:06.10]We needed that.
[140:08.04]The whole squad needed that.
[140:09.34]Oh, that game was, like, so funny.
[140:12.80]That was the goddamn movie.
[140:17.47]All I heard was, hey, there's people everywhere.
[140:19.27]We're surrounded by three teams, and I'm just like, it's too stressful.
[140:22.81]How do people play this game?
[140:23.57]It was extremely stressful, yeah.
[140:26.20]A lot of people play this.
[140:27.16]This game is like so intense.
[140:28.69]All these BRs.
[140:37.25]That was a fun one.
[140:38.34]I'm good with that.
[140:39.02]I call that a moral victory royale.
[140:40.78]That was awesome.
[140:42.80]Holy shit.
[140:43.80]We were just getting shot at by so many people and we all hopped in the car.
[140:48.17]That was so funny.
[140:49.09]The call for the triple reboot was very blessed.
[140:53.27]Somebody said he's way too old for this game.
[140:58.65]I don't know.
[141:00.04]It was fun.
[141:00.60]Whatever.
[141:01.52]I don't know what the fuck is happening.
[141:02.94]I just know there's colors on the screen and there's people surrounding it.
[141:06.34]I don't know.
[141:06.94]This is hard.
[141:07.86]I don't know what to do.
[141:09.58]Hard we did.
[141:11.13]Not even fucking close.
[141:15.79]That was fun.
[141:17.11]That was awesome.
[141:19.49]It's a nice react content from here on out.
[141:21.90]Yeah.
[141:29.25]I've never seen someone just sit in the first red like this for so long.
[141:34.57]I guess it just really doesn't hurt you that bad.
[141:36.69]No, it doesn't.
[141:37.25]The first zone just barely hurts you.
[141:38.87]It does one tick of damage.
[141:43.82]If only I had the vape, I would have been better.
[141:45.54]Dude, let me tell you.
[141:53.18]What was the last time that I played an FPS or a shooter on stream?
[141:59.42]It's probably been, like, three years.
[142:01.52]You did the encouragement guy video.
[142:08.90]You played, oh, Destiny 2.
[142:10.19]That's right.
[142:10.53]That was a fucking fog game.
[142:14.07]I think every team that we interacted with followed us.
[142:18.15]Like, they were like, let's go get those guys.
[142:19.73]And we all ended up in the same place.
[142:23.35]And then, not only did they do that, but then they all continued to only shoot at us.
[142:27.07]Yeah, they were like waving at each other like neighbors, dude.
[142:30.37]They're like, oh, you're killing these idiots too?
[142:32.59]That's awesome, yeah, you guys suck.
[142:35.15]Every round, they just fucking lose.
[142:38.90]We had the car, that was fun.
[142:40.34]That was fun in the car with you guys, let me just say.
[142:43.30]Dude, the music blasting, hanging out the window, I wouldn't trade that at all.
[142:59.14]God, I wish there was a fifth game.
[143:00.85]I know what we're getting.
[143:01.87]I really do.
[143:02.81]I really want there to be.
[143:03.85]I'm going to ask.
[143:04.49]Can we have a fifth?
[143:05.59]Can we do a Thug Finals fifth game?
[143:07.33]Thug Finals, yeah.
[143:08.99]Dude, let's just get a car again.
[143:10.19]I remember when we had the car.
[143:12.65]It was very special.
[143:14.25]I need to watch this clip.
[143:20.53]Professional gamer.
[143:22.55]That's not in my bio.
[143:25.79]We are better than last game.
[143:31.28]Yeah, I don't know how do you get I'm trying to desperately jump over Oh my god, this is bad.
[143:43.96]This is really bad.
[143:44.86]This is fucking terrible.
[143:47.50]Holy shit.
[143:48.38]Okay, let's put this on camera for a sec This is really really bad Like this is remarkably awful
[144:10.73]It's like remarkable how bad this is.
[144:18.78]Why wasn't I jumping up?
[144:20.14]Oh guys, we need to get to the fucking- we need to get in the car and get the fuck out.
[144:22.98]I need res, I need res.
[144:24.12]I'm resing you.
[144:24.80]Going.
[144:25.00]Double res, double res, double res.
[144:26.57]I'm getting hit too.
[144:28.65]Double res, don't do that to me.
[144:30.11]Sorry, I'm coming around.
[144:30.81]Oh shoot, I got a marker.
[144:31.47]Is there a way to get out of here?
[144:32.89]I guess we just run.
[144:33.63]Behind, yep.
[144:38.43]All I could see was purple!
[144:41.21]Honestly dude, all I could see- all I could see was purple.
[144:47.57]I couldn't see anything else.
[144:48.79]It was just purple!
[144:49.79]I couldn't see anything!
[145:08.46]Hey, they left, they left, bro.
[145:10.50]Yeah, they FF.
[145:12.00]Actually, that should boost us on the red.
[145:13.44]They forfeited.
[145:14.30]Wait, what?
[145:14.84]Somebody forfeited?
[145:17.40]Yeah, everyone left.
[145:17.82]Team number nine, like, everyone left.
[145:19.71]Oh, shit.
[145:20.61]But we'll see what place they're in.
[145:21.49]Like, they're not... Yeah, that team was in 13th place, so, like, they weren't gonna win anyways.
[145:28.53]I guess whoever's in first isn't gonna win another game, though.
[145:32.66]Okay, so here's the thing.
[145:33.60]I don't play, like, VRs, and when I hear somebody start to scream, like, oh my- they're here!
[145:38.82]Oh my god, they're here!
[145:40.63]I'm just like, they're here.
[145:41.31]Somebody's here.
[145:41.83]I don't know who's here, but I'm gonna die.
[145:42.87]We're dying.
[145:43.19]We're dead.
[145:43.61]We're gonna die.
[145:52.07]What is going on here?
[145:55.34]Just, uh... Just vibing.
[145:58.60]Oh, XQC is still here.
[145:59.76]Mm-hmm.
[146:02.48]Two in a squad a lot, but he's kind of nuts.
[146:11.64]That was insane.
[146:33.16]Desynced I'm about to play chug jug with you chopped and screwed This part wait was he just shooting at birds Was that a person
[147:01.63]He might have been shooting at a bird.
[147:02.69]Some birds drop loot.
[147:04.39]Oh.
[147:04.55]Oh.
[147:15.32]Oh, are you watching us?
[147:20.50]Oh, no.
[147:24.02]That was an advanced move.
[147:26.52]Dude, XQC is fucking amazing.
[147:31.84]Just born to game.
[147:33.30]Forced to stream.
[147:40.43]Dude.
[147:42.29]I think Alec is gonna win the turn.
[147:57.26]Somebody's like, my cat's staring at something on the wall.
[148:01.38]Your cat is?
[148:02.44]Somebody in chat investigated.
[148:09.40]Oh, their cat.
[148:10.28]Yeah.
[148:10.60]I was thinking they were commenting on maybe your cat in the background, but you have an extremely small cam.
[148:18.96]And maybe not even a cat.
[148:20.84]Correct.
[148:25.98]I love the size of your camera.
[148:30.52]It's just enough.
[148:33.36]I don't want to... There's lots of real estate that information people need to see.
[148:38.54]Yes, sir.
[148:39.98]Plus, I don't want people to see my pores and shit.
[148:42.45]Chad Warden's all about the games.
[148:49.25]If your camera's this small, boogers in your nose cannot be picked up.
[148:51.77]It's like the pixels can't... They blend together.
[148:55.68]Nick, that reference might thread the needle of all three of us.
[148:58.84]Yeah, I don't know if... Isn't that crazy?
[149:01.22]I don't know if SnapNav covers Shadowhorns.
[149:05.16]I think 20... Past 2000, that'd be... Ooh, X in trouble.
[149:11.53]Not looking... Ooh, ooh.
[149:13.49]He's healing up.
[149:15.07]And he has a... He has a grenade.
[149:16.37]He's gonna blast out of here like Jimmy's fucking Neutron.
[149:20.28]What?
[149:23.13]XQC as shit is a movie right now.
[149:25.05]Sorry, I like The Simpsons.
[149:27.40]Come on.
[149:28.20]XQC team is... What happened?
[149:36.32]No, they're all good.
[149:38.58]Go on.
[149:39.24]I said I think XQC team might win because they're getting so many elims right now.
[149:44.72]Yeah, it's insane.
[149:45.86]Oh my god, they have 17?
[149:48.70]No, that's the amount of people.
[149:49.94]I can't tell.
[149:50.84]I'm blind.
[149:51.16]I'm stupid.
[149:52.53]I've been watching them kill a lot of people.
[149:54.31]This is intense.
[149:57.05]XQC has been like 10 HP twice in this game and now he's full max and he's running at someone like an animal.
[150:09.68]Oh, he's going in.
[150:11.90]There it is.
[150:12.36]Oh my god.
[150:18.48]Oh my god, no way.
[150:20.56]They didn't even know each other was there?
[150:22.26]Dude, and then the guy blasted out.
[150:26.46]This is crazy.
[150:27.58]I have so much to learn.
[150:28.48]It's behind.
[150:30.54]I'm learning.
[150:31.24]I'm just, you know what?
[150:34.00]I'm going to stick to what I know.
[150:35.20]I'm not cut out for this at all.
[150:36.12]I really am not.
[150:37.00]I would have saw that person in the bush.
[150:38.79]I would have put both my hands up and gone, and I would have grabbed my chest.
[150:42.73]Take it, take it.
[150:44.85]And I would be dead.
[150:46.11]That would be like, I would hold my chest like this as if a mouse came in the room.
[150:50.87]your pearls I just can't I can watch I can watch all my games all day with the oh dear heavens yeah it would be like that oh shit oh heaven's me this is crazy they're just fucking killing everyone bro oh my god the person was a firework they shot themselves out there was like fourth of July
[151:18.13]Oh my, they're just gaming better than everyone else.
[151:23.41]X cleans it up right here.
[151:30.11]So it's like maybe 4v4v1 or like 4v3v2.
[151:33.95]I kind of don't want to move away from XQC's camera.
[151:38.27]Oh, I think it's one team versus another.
[151:40.32]Bro.
[151:43.54]He's just the main character.
[151:44.38]It's a 4v2.
[151:50.02]Stop moaning.
[151:54.54]Splash you up, King.
[151:58.80]Is it Mango's team?
[151:59.76]Wait, am I like moaning?
[152:01.38]What do you mean moaning?
[152:03.08]Am I?
[152:06.14]Stop doing that.
[152:06.82]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[152:08.33]It's loud in my ears.
[152:09.13]I can't hear what sounds are coming out of my mouth.
[152:15.55]They just destroyed that whole building.
[152:18.53]That was ridiculous.
[152:19.43]That was like the three little pigs in there.
[152:22.07]Oh, this is it.
[152:22.67]This is the end.
[152:25.03]This is the Daily Dose team?
[152:26.95]There it is.
[152:27.65]Oh, wow.
[152:30.26]Surely they won, right?
[152:31.18]There's no way.
[152:33.60]I'm just impressed.
[152:34.58]That was good.
[152:44.23]Jeez.
[152:44.71]That's it.
[152:45.57]Collap.
[152:46.59]Good game.
[152:49.85]You know what?
[152:52.91]We chose to learn today.
[152:54.33]We didn't choose to win.
[152:55.13]That's right.
[152:57.85]Can I just say, that was gentlemen, that was very fun.
[153:02.59]It was an honor.
[153:03.25]That was a lot of good fun.
[153:06.71]That was really fun.
[153:08.75]I'm glad I was on your guys' team.
[153:12.00]Yeah, same.
[153:13.00]That was a blast.
[153:13.86]I wouldn't have had it any other way.
[153:14.88]We got a fucking juicy, juicy cinematic moment.
[153:23.67]I'm so sorry that you had a gigantic anchor that was thrown out at the first five seconds of the game.
[153:31.01]It wasn't that way.
[153:31.87]Tarek just rolled up and he just put one right against my forehead.
[153:35.26]That anchor's name was Shroud.
[153:37.14]Yeah.
[153:40.07]Shroud just killing us off the rip every single game.
[153:42.98]That was the problem.
[153:44.24]Alright.
[153:46.38]I'm going to get out of here before Ludwig gets in the chat.
[153:48.36]I can't face him.
[153:49.88]I am a small, weak man mentally.
[153:52.20]Oh, no.
[153:53.48]And actually, I might go downstairs and say how to myth, but alright.
[153:57.82]GG, boys.
[153:58.42]Alright.
[153:59.12]See you.
[153:59.62]Take it easy, guys.
[154:00.18]See you later.
[154:07.66]We're coming last place.
[154:16.50]I'm noticing a pattern.
[154:19.98]Mario Kart Tournament I was invited to.
[154:21.96]It came in last place.
[154:24.26]Super Auto Pets Tournament I was invited to.
[154:25.80]It came in last place.
[154:27.85]Fortnite Tournament I was invited to.
[154:29.09]It came in last place.
[154:38.70]Well, wait, is that entirely true?
[154:40.46]I think I came in like 8th, 7th or 8th in the Mario Kart Tournament.
[154:47.85]It's all good, though.
[154:48.57]Whatever.
[154:49.35]Look, I was supposed to stream tomorrow, but I was like, you know what?
[154:51.83]Fuck it.
[154:52.05]Let's just go early.
[154:52.85]And Ludwig's like, do you want to do it?
[154:54.71]And I'm like, um, I guess.
[154:57.60]Sure.
[155:00.88]Why not?
[155:01.44]It's fun.
[155:04.28]Hang out with some boys.
[155:07.54]Don't feel embarrassed.
[155:08.18]Oh, I'm not embarrassed.
[155:08.84]That last round was fun.
[155:10.34]The first one was fun, too.
[155:11.21]It was all fun.
[155:19.28]Alright.
[155:20.59]What we are doing now... No, but seriously, though, like, I like doing this stuff.
[155:25.89]It's fun to, obviously, like, meet new people, hang out with some new people, right?
[155:30.85]Obviously, I've got the streamer rewards.
[155:33.18]I spend time with some of those guys.
[155:35.64]Oh, no, yeah, it was fun.
[155:36.84]Look, it doesn't matter.
[155:38.72]I'm annoyed at the internet problem.
[155:40.38]It's not the fact that I came in last place in the Fortnite tournament.
[155:44.79]So, what we're gonna do now...
[155:46.63]We're going to take a quick break.
[155:48.87]I'm going to get a refill of my drink.
[155:51.76]And then, ladies and gentlemen, I've got something very, very special for you.
[155:55.56]I've got every FromSoftware boss ever that I need to place on a tier list.
[156:01.02]Because I completed Elden Ring.
[156:03.96]This is going to be one of the most important streams I've ever done.
[156:08.66]One of the most important streams I've ever done.
[156:11.54]When we come back in just a few minutes.
[156:18.99]See you guys in a minute.
[157:23.54]I'm still here.
[157:24.36]I'm typing.
[157:25.08]I know, it's a hot mic.
[157:26.86]I didn't mute it yet.
[157:27.72]I haven't left.
[157:34.70]I gotta change the title.
[157:36.03]Alright, not up here, babe.
