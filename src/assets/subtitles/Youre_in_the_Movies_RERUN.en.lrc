[ve:60.16.100]

[00:24.54]I just realized something.
[00:27.14]People that are in here right now, that when the stream goes live, and they say the word VOD, they go, VOD, VOD, VOD, VOD!
[00:37.95]Right?
[00:39.99]You're saying VOD to the VOD watchers, but this is a VOD.
[00:45.82]You're about to watch a VOD.
[00:48.96]So who is really the VOD watcher?
[00:53.94]By the way, these streams are all getting deleted.
[00:56.52]I'm not gonna have... I'm not gonna have, like, a bunch of old VODs.
[01:02.90]Just be... It would look like... You know, like, you ever, like, refresh Twitter?
[01:08.37]And, like, old tweets just kind of pop up to the top, and they mess up, and they go back down.
[01:12.91]It's like a bad program.
[01:16.87]You ever had that happen to you?
[01:18.71]Well, neither have I. I just couldn't think of the thing that I was trying to tell you.
[01:24.13]I was thinking of a dashboard.
[01:26.35]The dashboard that has a bunch of things that are in YouTube subscriptions.
[01:30.42]There you go.
[01:30.80]Got it.
[01:31.30]Done.
[01:35.92]You ever like open up your... Remember like the sub feed used to be so fucked up?
[01:43.36]Is he actually talking right now?
[01:44.66]Yes.
[01:44.94]Yes.
[01:47.42]That's where it gets tricky, isn't it?
[01:49.54]Tricky.
[01:50.02]We get the first voice crack since I've come back.
[01:52.76]I haven't even come back.
[01:54.42]That's a lie.
[01:58.76]This is live.
[01:59.66]Yes, what you're seeing right now is live.
[02:02.62]I'm here.
[02:04.06]In real time.
[02:05.68]But not anymore.
[02:07.77]Not after I've hit the play button on this video.
[02:14.55]How am I feeling?
[02:15.09]I'm feeling pretty good.
[02:17.97]I'm still on antibiotics.
[02:21.56]I can't tell if they're improving any of my conditions or not.
[02:26.33]That's the problem with this stuff, is every day I'm waking up in bed and I'm going, okay, is it, how does it feel?
[02:34.53]Is it gone?
[02:34.85]I think it's gone.
[02:35.93]No, it's not.
[02:36.69]Oh, it's there still.
[02:37.75]Wait, it could be gone though.
[02:38.67]I'll wait like another hour.
[02:39.61]Maybe it'll be gone in an hour.
[02:40.69]How long does it take for antibiotics to do anything?
[02:43.68]Like two to three days?
[02:45.42]It's been exactly three days and 25 minutes.
[02:48.96]It's gone?
[02:49.62]No, it's not.
[02:50.94]It's just, it's still there.
[02:57.98]But this week coming up here is one of the most important ones of this entire time I've taken off.
[03:04.21]This is the week where I get scan results.
[03:07.11]This is where I get the scans.
[03:09.81]I've had a bunch of them.
[03:12.11]And as of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I'm going to be going back to the doctor and it's like, okay, here are the scans.
[03:22.20]But this is the week to really try to hammer down what's going on.
[03:28.08]He's getting scammed.
[03:30.65]Scan.
[03:31.53]Scam.
[03:35.83]But today, we're going to show an old stream, like we did last time, a few days ago.
[03:41.74]This one is... You know, I'll be honest with you.
[03:45.00]This one was a lot higher voted and rated than I thought it was going to be.
[03:51.50]You're in the movies?
[03:54.77]I just, like,
[03:56.50]Get drunk and dance around in my fucking room.
[04:00.82]And then we watch terrible movies that I did.
[04:05.14]Alright, did I just... I think I just figured out why.
[04:09.53]I was... Hey, hey!
[04:12.07]Replay You're In The Movies!
[04:15.23]You know?
[04:15.75]The stream where you're just a dickhead?
[04:18.61]Day drinking?
[04:22.91]Yeah!
[04:24.15]That's a good idea!
[04:32.34]it is uh uh without further ado I do want to say thanks for the five community subs for living and thank thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you we get a look at me I think it's too early for a look at me I'm gonna come in and scare you
[04:58.31]I'll pop in from time to time.
[04:59.23]The stream is about 6 hours.
[05:01.07]So you have about 6 hours and 10 minutes or so before I get to the bit readings.
[05:06.45]Again, I'm not doing bit readings on these because it makes no sense.
[05:12.63]So it's a 6 hour and 12 minute stream, I guess.
[05:15.51]Just about.
[05:16.92]I'll be in every maybe an hour or two.
[05:20.00]I'll come back and
[05:21.98]That's a lie.
[05:22.96]You can't keep me away.
[05:24.82]You can't.
[05:25.44]I just can't be kept away.
[05:26.86]I say, hey, I'll check in in an hour.
[05:28.78]I'll be back in 10 minutes.
[05:29.90]You all know it.
[05:31.34]I'm going to react to what I just saw on screen.
[05:37.91]Hey, GB Clown.
[05:38.47]Thanks for 10 community subs.
[05:40.75]Any updates?
[05:41.31]Alright, I'll give you some more updates on some stuff.
[05:43.72]The baseball stream is moving forward.
[05:47.34]It's in a really tricky spot right now, though, because I do not want to jeopardize the health of anybody.
[05:52.66]I talked in the free stream chat about this.
[05:56.18]And with the stream like this, where there's a lot of people involved, I want to follow the correct guidelines.
[06:03.11]I want to make sure we do this safely.
[06:05.01]And we also need to monitor how COVID-19 keeps going.
[06:09.06]You see it in some states.
[06:10.04]It's been coming back kind of very, very, very strongly.
[06:14.66]So we really have to be careful here.
[06:16.18]It's going to be a week-to-week basis.
[06:17.90]And if it gets to a point where it's not going to be feasible, then we're going to have to figure that out.
[06:22.23]We'll have to move it.
[06:24.11]But the idea is to do it safely and to do it somewhere in the end of August.
[06:32.70]That's the timeline.
[06:34.53]A lot can change in the next 30 to 40 days.
[06:37.67]So we are daily actively monitoring how it plays out.
[06:44.77]I almost read that.
[06:54.66]I gotta get better at this whole streaming thing, don't you think?
[06:59.56]Of all the... I look over, and I don't read any comments.
[07:05.45]I think I've read one comment.
[07:07.17]And there's probably been, let's say, like 6,000 to 7,000 messages in the last seven minutes.
[07:14.31]And the second one that I read is that one.
[07:18.27]How... yeah.
[07:20.71]And I was about to read it out loud.
[07:22.49]I gotta get better at this screaming thing, man.
[07:24.17]I ain't very good at this.
[07:28.37]But without further ado, we're gonna play it.
[07:31.30]This stream, it was a lot of fun.
[07:32.60]It was funny.
[07:33.74]It was funny.
[07:34.24]You know, this stream was fun.
[07:35.12]It was funny.
[07:35.78]You know, I'll say it.
[07:36.90]It was funny.
[07:40.26]Enjoy it.
[07:40.78]I'll be back.
[07:41.80]This is You're in the Movies.
[07:46.15]Streamer thinks he's funny.
[07:47.21]Streamer laughs at own jokes.
[07:49.33]Yeah, it's funny, okay?
[07:50.65]I think so.
[07:56.06]What do you mean funny?
[07:56.62]What do you mean?
[07:57.18]Talking about like, haha, like clown funny?
[08:00.22]It's just a funny thing to say.
[08:01.96]What are you talking about?
[08:02.70]Is that a funny thing to say?
[08:03.32]What do you mean?
[08:04.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[08:07.26]Jerry, it was a funny way you said it.
[08:16.77]I don't even know what his name is in that movie.
[08:23.33]Hey, hey, something's wrong with you.
[08:24.29]Hey, something's wrong with your screen.
[08:26.51]Fuck.
[08:26.91]Oh, something's wrong with my computer.
[08:28.33]I'm back.
[08:30.01]I'm here.
[08:31.11]I made it.
[08:34.75]The internet works.
[08:36.51]Stream is bopping.
[08:38.98]I can feel the energy.
[08:40.04]Hi, guys.
[08:45.82]It's time for the movies.
[08:46.60]We've been waiting for this like three days.
[08:51.48]The internet has been fixed.
[08:54.18]I've been assured of that.
[08:58.09]We've done a lot of testing.
[09:01.95]Almost no drop frames in the last probably 12 to 15 hours.
[09:07.49]That's pretty good.
[09:08.17]That's the green light.
[09:09.01]Now, if we get a red light here, then that's, I mean, that's not fair.
[09:15.29]But you kind of have to do what you do, right?
[09:19.51]Are you talking to me?
[09:20.97]Yeah?
[09:23.70]But anyways, this room has been set up for the last three days to do this.
[09:27.92]And I've been really excited to do this because this game looks really fun.
[09:31.55]Looks like a good time.
[09:32.65]Hey, spoiler.
[09:36.71]It's funny.
[09:37.69]Move this out of the way.
[09:41.71]So everything gets zapped.
[09:45.75]On like a monthly basis here.
[09:47.01]And it's very frustrating.
[09:48.75]Can I just say?
[09:49.21]I mean, you guys know this.
[09:52.84]But I'm ready.
[09:54.53]I'm not going to wait anymore.
[09:55.65]This is ready to go.
[09:56.47]Want me to prove it?
[09:59.17]Is this the right VOD?
[10:00.11]Do I have the right... Well, this is, right?
[10:06.15]Take a look at this shit.
[10:09.39]Is this the right one?
[10:10.37]What if it just turns on and it's like a video stream you've never seen?
[10:13.02]Oh, there he is!
[10:13.96]Alright, we're going to make sure it's synced up correctly.
[10:16.18]Yes, I'm wearing a wire.
[10:17.92]I'm sure you've been aware of that.
[10:19.00]Is the frame ready or what?
[10:21.34]No, we're good.
[10:22.86]I'm in my workout gear.
[10:24.01]What the fuck?
[10:27.85]That's an Xbox Live Vision camera.
[10:32.13]They don't make these anymore.
[10:33.25]You have to buy them from third party sellers.
[10:35.41]He's a snitch.
[10:36.43]I bought two of them just in case the price goes up.
[10:38.71]Imagine if this was like part of an investigation and you guys just never knew.
[10:42.45]I've got my cocktail table over here.
[10:43.97]Apparently doing a bay breeze.
[10:47.42]If you don't know what that is.
[10:49.44]Look it up.
[10:49.98]It's tasty.
[10:52.26]Metal straw, yeah!
[10:53.72]It's better that way, it's colder.
[10:57.76]See?
[11:00.76]What is this?
[11:01.63]Ah, you'll find out.
[11:04.25]You'll find out real soon.
[11:05.71]Alright, so let's just do it.
[11:07.67]Let me get locked in.
[11:12.89]You can't even hear- the music is fucking awesome.
[11:15.83]There, now you can hear everything.
[11:17.54]We gotta sync this up, make sure- Can you see my mouth move when my mouth moves?
[11:22.73]One, two, three, four.
[11:25.54]Hey, we got a green screen back here.
[11:27.60]Let's add some footage right now.
[11:29.16]Here we go.
[11:35.14]I'm in a car now.
[11:37.78]Take that one.
[11:38.22]Put it somewhere.
[11:38.66]I don't know.
[11:39.56]How about this one?
[11:41.00]How come none of you have used any of this?
[11:46.28]This is extra green screen DLC footage.
[11:48.34]Nobody's used it.
[11:49.20]Use it.
[11:49.72]Use any of this.
[11:51.08]Who cares?
[11:53.89]It sucks.
[11:54.53]The lighting sucks.
[11:55.33]It's not good.
[11:55.73]That's two extra bonus clips that you didn't have before.
[11:58.13]Oh, god damn it.
[11:58.81]I'm so predictable.
[11:59.71]Alright.
[12:00.11]What did you say?
[12:02.47]The sync is off?
[12:04.27]Ready?
[12:07.00]Here we go.
[12:09.58]Did you hear that?
[12:10.16]It's so fucking loud.
[12:12.46]Hey!
[12:13.90]Hey!
[12:15.26]Hey!
[12:17.71]It's off?
[12:18.29]What?
[12:19.79]How off is it?
[12:23.57]Alright, can you hear my voice first or hear my voice later?
[12:25.93]And this is very important.
[12:30.15]While I spend, like, the next 35 minutes setting this up... My audio is early.
[12:34.65]I have a really important... I'm turning this down.
[12:37.58]How often do you guys do this and it's fake?
[12:40.48]Like, this is a meme that you guys just fuck with me every time, right?
[12:44.28]Like, almost every single time.
[12:47.12]So I am always in sync when I ask that question.
[12:49.68]Right?
[12:50.60]Right?
[12:56.23]Always.
[12:56.53]So when I'd sit here and do shit like this for like 20 minutes, this is entertaining you.
[13:04.71]Just knowing that it's never been a problem.
[13:07.31]And I am so desperately trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist.
[13:16.28]Sometimes it is bad.
[13:19.80]Alright, I'm out of here.
[13:21.34]Hey, have fun, kids.
[13:23.78]Hey, have fun, kids.
[13:27.64]Focus?
[13:29.84]Yes.
[13:31.24]Is the lighting OK in here?
[13:32.87]Check the light meter to be sure.
[13:34.83]Uh-oh.
[13:36.17]It's a little out of the grid.
[13:38.59]No, it's still in the grid.
[13:39.42]That's alright.
[13:39.96]It's OK.
[13:42.46]Now, let's position the camera.
[13:44.84]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline without appearing too small or too big.
[13:50.96]If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in, tilt the camera up or down and try again.
[13:59.84]Welcome to the cutout studio.
[14:01.99]This is where we separate your image from the background.
[14:05.67]Select start.
[14:07.65]Great.
[14:09.05]Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.
[14:13.78]Please hold on.
[14:16.48]Cutout complete.
[14:18.54]Now get back in front of the camera.
[14:21.00]Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best result.
[14:25.99]Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?
[14:30.57]What do you guys think?
[14:34.43]Four?
[14:34.77]I think four looks good.
[14:36.77]Four has a little bit of haze in it.
[14:40.74]One is bad, two is worse, three is okay, four is haze.
[14:44.22]I don't know if I like four.
[14:47.10]Which one?
[14:47.92]You tell me, you tell me, ready?
[14:56.30]Shit!
[14:57.94]This is two.
[15:01.97]This is three.
[15:06.54]This one's four.
[15:07.14]One.
[15:15.72]Two or three?
[15:16.10]Try one more time.
[15:17.32]I'll give you a lefty.
[15:22.39]No, it's okay.
[15:24.35]We need to be trained at a very young age to use both of our hands and arms.
[15:29.17]Because seriously, take a look at this.
[15:30.15]Ready?
[15:30.27]I'm going to show you.
[15:33.38]We're gone.
[15:34.28]Right?
[15:34.50]If you're coming from over here, or if you're coming from that way, you're going to laugh.
[15:41.40]I can't fend off an attacker that way.
[15:44.85]Why can nobody use... We need to be taught at a young age to use both of our hands.
[15:49.89]I can't... Throwing a ball like this is like... Throwing a ball like this, I could fucking... I could go 100.
[15:57.90]Alright.
[16:00.26]Two looks good.
[16:03.01]I already winded it.
[16:06.72]This might be a quick one.
[16:10.60]I've been waiting fucking three days to do this and I'm already like, I threw four punches, it's time to go home.
[16:16.88]Alright.
[16:20.93]No, no, no, no free.
[16:21.99]Two's fine.
[16:24.01]One's actually not that bad either.
[16:27.89]Okay.
[16:31.77]Just don't come to any of my streams until 25 minutes have gone by.
[16:37.35]Just open up your Twitch app.
[16:40.20]Okay, has 16 to 20 minutes gone by?
[16:42.54]I'll go.
[16:43.90]It's time for me to show up.
[16:46.58]Which one?
[16:48.06]Cut out one or two?
[16:48.94]Three or four?
[16:49.70]It's been 25 minutes.
[16:53.37]Just wait until 15 minutes have gone by.
[16:55.86]Am I left-handed?
[16:58.98]No, I'm right-handed.
[17:00.80]I'm sitting here like just going, my god, man.
[17:06.32]Why am I so scary looking?
[17:08.12]I just ripped out the fucking cord.
[17:11.86]What?
[17:12.16]I don't care.
[17:13.75]Hold on, I have to connect my- Some streamers have intros that are 20 minutes long.
[17:21.91]I bumble around like a fucking idiot for 20 minutes.
[17:24.51]That's my intro.
[17:27.64]Is this me?
[17:32.82]Play fight?
[17:33.20]Dodge the arms and strike the targets.
[17:34.62]Yeah.
[17:35.52]I tested this one.
[17:37.04]Pretend you're in a dojo preparing for a big fight.
[17:41.06]Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score.
[17:45.95]Anytime you look at somebody from the side, it's just like, oof.
[17:47.81]Action!
[17:50.01]You fight like a master.
[17:54.41]Ouch, that's smart.
[17:55.29]Oops.
[17:57.56]What?
[17:57.84]What's happening in the corner?
[18:03.10]What's happening?
[18:06.18]This is fucking stupid.
[18:06.98]Always use the paw.
[18:08.84]Always use the paw.
[18:11.15]Right here.
[18:22.90]Ouch, that smarts.
[18:24.26]Feel like I'm playing Nick Arcade.
[18:26.48]Revenge.
[18:33.05]What a crushing blow.
[18:38.91]Awesome.
[18:39.81]Got it.
[18:40.87]You just beat the heck out of Bruce Lee there.
[18:43.35]Whew.
[18:45.69]Whew.
[18:47.19]That wasn't bad.
[18:48.69]Player one, come to the set, please.
[18:55.42]And now, it's your time to shine!
[18:59.34]Just follow my instructions and act like a star!
[19:04.14]Give me your most evil laugh!
[19:09.84]Action!
[19:10.85]Come on!
[19:14.29]Come on!
[19:18.55]That was fantastic!
[19:20.65]You were a star!
[19:25.20]That's it?
[19:25.52]Alright, let's go!
[19:27.60]Star... I look at the fucking character from the office.

[20:51.51]Good throwing.
[20:53.59]That log sure won't bother us again.
[20:55.90]I thought it was going to be like a situation where you just had to get the thing, the pixel, to touch quick.
[21:02.08]Player one, get yourself to the set.
[21:04.30]Don't worry, that's me.
[21:04.94]I know where I'm supposed to be.

[22:00.71]Because there is no logical explanation as to why somebody would be standing in their room doing this.
[22:06.03]I'm like hyping myself up for what, like a conference?
[22:16.75]Look at how red my face is.
[22:18.53]I didn't realize how hot it was gonna be in here.

[23:33.28]Throw the ball in the hoop three times to win a prize.
[23:36.37]Hey, let me do this like, this is like, oh, I gotta shoot the basket.

[24:20.10]By the way, at the end of this, it cuts up a trailer.
[24:25.38]With like three other random actors that aren't in this house.
[24:27.94]I can't figure out if my pants are too big or my shirt is too small.
[24:31.73]You're having trouble.
[24:33.07]I'm trying to figure this out.
[24:37.11]Let's see.
[24:37.51]Are you ready?
[24:39.11]I'm ready.
[24:39.45]Okay.
[24:40.55]Carry on.

[24:56.99]It's gonna be fucking impossible.
[24:58.29]I'm gonna be like purple at the end of this.
[25:11.72]Everyone's super.
[25:17.84]Every superhero's super.
[25:21.52]But some are more super than others.
[25:32.49]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[25:40.51]battles, adventure, breathtaking effects.

[26:05.84]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[26:11.05]faster than waiting for a bus.

[32:41.38]Alright, live looks fine.
[32:43.86]Now, let's position the camera.
[32:46.24]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline without appearing too small.
[32:51.30]People will do like a thing.
[32:52.50]Oh, look, the thing on the ground over there is six feet tall, therefore he's triangular.
[32:58.29]He's 5'2".

[33:01.23]It's not going to be an original joke.

[33:25.16]Now, get back in front of the camera.
[33:27.38]That was scary because I have a big shadow on my face.
[33:29.76]And I've got a real angular face.
[33:32.82]Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background?
[33:35.73]You could get shade over here in my angular fucking face.

[33:48.96]Two is fine, right?
[33:50.12]Yeah.
[33:52.00]It's gonna change a little bit as the light changes.

[33:55.72]That's fine.

[34:00.39]Choose the correct number.
[34:02.77]Alright, here's where I'm gonna... I'm gonna add an actor.
[34:04.75]I'm gonna add an actor.
[34:10.15]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.

[55:42.59]Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.
[55:45.61]I thought, like, ooh, to be sitting on the coffee table and I can make it, like, a nice warm hue.

[139:38.19]What is Biff?
[139:41.98]Alright, here we go.
[139:44.24]Shh.
[139:55.60]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[140:01.16]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[140:14.23]A little romance, excitement, and security is what we're all looking for.
[140:30.72]And if it doesn't work out, we try again.
[140:34.38]And again.
[140:35.56]But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.
[141:02.72]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[141:07.32]When he opens the door and he's naked, he's just naked.
[141:17.53]I need to see it again.
[141:29.01]I'm gonna be quiet for this one.
[141:30.73]I'm gonna try.
[141:42.44]The whole dancing thing still makes no sense to me.
[141:45.00]That's like a full two minutes of acting.
[141:49.58]Alright.
[141:57.93]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[142:03.47]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[142:16.51]A little romance, excitement and security is what we're all looking for.
[142:32.97]And if it doesn't work out, we try again.
[142:36.73]And again.
[142:55.53]But sometimes, the right one for you is closer than you think.
[143:05.02]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[143:09.64]Oh, my God.
[143:21.23]I kinda have to.
[143:21.93]That was fucking ridiculous.
[143:25.47]Thieves still at large.
[143:28.77]Why do they all keep getting arrested?
[143:32.52]A fraud that the bar is closing on?
[143:34.88]Oh my goodness.
[143:39.62]I gotta go get Iceman.
[143:40.56]I gotta fucking take a break after this one.
[143:43.90]That was fucking so stupid.
[143:52.95]what website was that and the fact that like there's a there's a scene where there's just two there's two fat fat suit people at a club or something like what it doesn't make any sense did I fuck something up I think I screwed something up it's the same person I'm just gonna call it love story god damn that was fucking fun
[144:23.68]At the very end, with pushing the cake, there's no context to any of this shit.
[144:28.74]Ugh.
[144:34.71]Alright, I'll be right back while this saves.
[144:36.23]I'm gonna grab some ice.
[144:37.57]I'm gonna grab some water and I'll be right back.
[144:43.21]I'll take over from here past Jerma.
[144:45.95]Hey, present Jerma here.
[144:47.96]Just checking in on you, seeing how you're doing.
[144:51.24]Just want to come in and say that
[144:54.33]it's so sad and so disappointing that we're likely to never get another game that's like this ever again.
[145:04.74]Remember the movies?
[145:06.60]The green screen, little green screen games with the camera toys.
[145:11.90]I wish we could get another one of these.
[145:14.74]A new one.
[145:15.50]A real one.
[145:16.99]A current gen one.
[145:19.47]All these games.
[145:21.35]It's so much fun to play and they're just so hysterical.
[145:24.19]Can you imagine a PS5 or a current PC hardware version of one of these games?
[145:31.22]It would be amazing.
[145:34.87]It would be endless.
[145:37.85]You know, some people have a game or something that they play pretty much every day.
[145:41.89]I'm a League channel.
[145:46.63]I'm an Overwatch channel.
[145:47.93]And I do all this stuff sometimes.
[145:49.98]If any game were to come out that was just like this and had limitless potential, I would be a eye toy, like a camera toy, PC, look at me, I'm in a movie streamer.
[146:04.08]That's what I would do every day.
[146:10.42]It's just too bad that none of these things ever took off because I mean, let's put it this way.
[146:15.86]Like, this is like fun for 20 minutes when you have a few friends over.
[146:21.58]But nobody long term really gives a shit about any of these.
[146:27.26]There's a VR one.
[146:31.93]Like, why couldn't the Kinect have gotten popular?
[146:35.13]It was for, like... Kinect is weird.
[146:37.55]Because Kinect was really popular for, like, six days.
[146:41.26]Everybody talked about it.
[146:42.02]It was a huge deal.
[146:42.80]Oh, wow, the Kinect!
[146:43.80]You can do this, you can do that!
[146:44.70]And then, like, maybe six or seven days later, nobody gave a shit ever again.
[146:50.66]It's the quickest turnaround I've ever seen.
[146:53.43]Oh, okay, movie's coming back.
[146:55.58]I'll see you guys later.
[146:56.80]See, I had to blow my nose after that one.
[147:00.53]Oh shit!
[147:00.87]Who's the best actor?
[147:24.84]Nominee three.
[147:29.78]Nominee four.
[147:33.61]But of course, there can only be one winner.
[147:38.29]And the You're in the Movies Award for Best Actor goes to... Magnified Hair.
[147:51.23]Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award.
[147:54.79]Perhaps you'd like to say a few words.
[147:58.23]Really fucking excited and happy about the last production.
[148:02.20]So much that I decided, yeah, I decided to do my favorite drink.
[148:06.60]Cranberry juice vodka and vomit.
[148:10.08]The favorite.
[148:18.33]Look it up.
[148:22.11]Fuck the Academy!

[256:58.62]I'll be player two.
[256:59.78]That's fine with me.
[257:09.70]Drive your scooter through town.
[257:11.82]Dodge the obstacles, but hit the ramps to score.
[257:16.28]This one is the worst.
[257:17.30]I really hate this one.
[257:18.72]More than Passion.
[257:20.34]Action!
[257:21.46]This one's just not fun.
[257:23.04]Woohoo!
[257:24.64]I'm having so much fun with this one.
[257:30.02]Is that a bird?
[257:32.48]A plane?
[257:37.66]It's Stuntman!
[257:45.75]Don't ever use this footage.
[257:47.50]We just put it in the game for no reason.
[257:52.88]There's no footage that's being taken from this game.
[257:58.00]It's just here.
[258:02.16]Find the paintwork.
[258:05.58]Have you got a license for that thing?
[258:07.34]I do.
[258:08.82]You said we have liftoff.
[258:10.66]Still technically the bicycles here don't need a license.
[258:16.14]Cool.
[258:16.30]That was a lot of fun.
[258:19.85]Glad I did that whole fucking thing.
[258:21.23]This is not going to be in the movie at all.
[258:27.05]We're going to combine two costumes here.
[258:39.93]Pretend you're in a dojo, preparing for a big fight.
[258:43.73]Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score.
[258:50.80]And... action!
[258:52.84]Right on target!
[258:57.10]Dodge!
[258:57.66]Dodge!
[258:58.14]I'm too wide!
[258:59.86]Run home to your mummy, dummy.
[259:02.84]You're getting a beating.
[259:05.00]Do you know kung fu?
[259:07.90]Now that must have hurt.
[259:10.00]A lot!
[259:12.02]That's gonna hurt tomorrow!
[259:18.76]You're supposed to dodge!
[259:22.60]You came to beating!
[259:26.66]Bullseye!
[259:27.68]Take that, dummy head!
[259:31.69]Nice hair.
[259:32.47]Take that, dummy!
[259:33.39]You got nice hair?
[259:35.57]Ouch, that's smart!
[259:37.38]Ready?
[259:38.44]Nice hair, huh?
[259:39.98]That was awful.
[259:41.95]I couldn't decide who was more wooden, you or the dummy.
[259:49.19]Player four, get yourself to the set.
[259:51.82]Player four, um... Player four, player four.
[259:59.16]Player four.
[260:03.02]Run as fast as you can!
[260:05.47]Reach the gate to escape the charging bull!
[260:14.21]Action!
[260:19.19]He sure got a mean look about him, don't he?
[260:21.72]Get those arms moving to gain speed!
[260:25.26]Yee-haw!
[260:29.22]He sure got a mean look about him, don't he?
[260:36.34]Great work, Slim.
[260:37.70]You rule the rodeo.
[260:47.65]Player one, come to the set, please.
[260:55.53]And now, it's your time to shine.
[260:58.63]Just follow my instructions and act like a star.
[261:03.89]Run on the spot as fast as you can.
[261:06.37]Action.
[261:13.16]That's it.
[261:18.29]You were amazing.
[261:20.07]What a pro.
[261:24.95]Player two, come to the set please.
[261:27.37]That's me.
[261:35.22]It's time for your starring moment.
[261:37.64]There's no scoring.
[261:38.97]Follow my instruction and act your heart out.
[261:44.69]Slap your fist and look mean.
[261:50.30]Action.
[261:50.56]Keep it up.
[261:53.28]Keep it up.
[261:55.88]Stay on set.
[261:59.56]Look as confused as you can.
[262:06.32]I don't know what's going on.
[262:07.81]I don't know what's happening here.
[262:09.53]I'm so confused.
[262:10.13]I'm very confused.
[262:10.83]I'm not sure what's happening.
[262:12.09]Here comes another.
[262:14.63]Strut funkily on the spot.
[262:22.01]And action.
[262:25.07]Keep rolling, baby.
[262:30.39]That was fantastic.
[262:32.43]You were a star.
[262:35.92]She doesn't look like no one in the movie.
[262:37.20]On the set, please.
[262:38.28]Double the T.F.
[262:38.80]Double the T.F.
[262:39.62]Double the T.F.
[262:40.18]Oh, fuck you.
[262:45.56]It's time for your starring moment.
[262:48.10]Follow my instruction and act your heart out.
[262:50.95]Who's three?
[262:51.91]Who's three?
[262:54.55]Imagine you're looking down a well.
[262:59.55]Action!
[263:01.97]More feeling.
[263:03.63]Put more feeling into it.
[263:07.54]Great.
[263:08.32]Stay there.
[263:10.86]Walk on the spot like an evil villain.
[263:17.68]And action.
[263:21.46]Keep it up.
[263:26.03]They loved you, baby.
[263:28.61]Like the inside of a trash can.
[263:38.77]I think that has nothing to do with me.
[263:40.89]Because I'm a clean person.
[263:42.43]I think that's just dirty.
[263:43.69]Like, that's just dirty laundry.
[263:49.02]Player four, get your butt on the set.
[263:52.88]Was player... Player three was the fat one?
[263:57.08]Oops.
[263:57.74]Oh, that's okay.
[263:59.86]Start the water from rising.
[264:01.78]Shut the valve as if your life depended on it.
[264:13.12]Turn the wheel!
[264:18.30]Faster!
[264:19.12]Faster!
[264:19.68]I feel like you gotta hold up so you don't, like, see me naked back here.
[264:28.33]Oh, hold on!
[264:29.37]Hold on a second!
[264:30.71]Uh, just wait a minute!
[264:31.47]I don't have any peanuts on!
[264:32.61]Just hold on!
[264:33.31]I'll be right there!
[264:34.07]Thanks!
[264:34.31]I need a sign for the delivery!
[264:35.81]Okay, just hold on!
[264:36.49]Just stay there!
[264:37.53]I... Jesus, what the fuck am I doing?
[264:41.49]Player one, you're needed on set!
[264:52.04]Pretend that you're surrounded by hornets!
[264:54.98]Swat those suckers before they sting ya!
[265:02.35]Action!
[265:05.47]Ouch!
[265:11.80]You were born to swat.
[265:16.43]Sayonara, Stripey.
[265:18.91]Take him down.
[265:21.51]You got one.
[265:23.63]Take that, you picnic spoiling fiend.
[265:27.03]Well done, you sure can swat.
[265:39.66]Player two, you're needed on set.
[265:53.56]It's time to act like a clown with a bungee run!
[265:56.74]Now run as far as you can before the power of the bungee drags you back!
[266:05.66]Action!
[266:06.72]Get those arms moving to gain speed!
[266:15.75]You do you, but I say no.
[266:16.95]Wow!
[266:17.47]That was some bungee!
[266:19.19]You did it!
[266:20.53]What if I was on a farm?
[266:21.39]What if I was, like, on a farm?
[266:26.82]Player three, come to the set, please.
[266:37.22]It's digging time!
[266:39.00]Shake the jackhammer handles as hard as you can to drill.
[266:48.99]I just want to come and chime in and say that we're at the part of the stream where I don't care about wearing the costumes.
[267:05.96]I only care about them just touching me so you know it's a different person.
[267:12.11]Just noticing this.
[267:20.51]What is this on the ground for?
[267:21.79]Player four, come to the set, please.
[267:23.91]Player four was... Who the fuck was player four?
[267:30.68]And now it's your time to shine.
[267:33.80]Just follow my instructions and act like a star.
[267:36.50]No, it's me.
[267:36.98]It's this again.
[267:39.16]Roll, right?
[267:39.46]Fold your arms and look as angry as you can.
[267:51.02]Oh, shit!
[268:21.54]Somebody asked, why are you always looking at the camera?
[268:24.27]Well, because I have to do actions on camera.
[268:27.79]So when it says, swap the bees, the bees aren't in my room.
[268:32.37]They're on the monitor over where the camera is.
[268:37.55]There's not a jackhammer in my office.
[268:41.56]I have to look at the camera and look at the screen.
[268:47.72]If this was a real movie set, I would be a fucking pro.
[268:51.24]Strike your chin like you're deep in thought.
[268:56.90]Action.
[268:59.26]Alright.
[269:02.67]One more.
[269:06.05]Pose like a hero.
[269:11.65]Action.
[269:13.85]Keep it going.
[269:19.52]That was fantastic.
[269:21.56]You were a star.
[269:25.24]Player two, I need you on set, please.
[269:28.18]Player two on set.
[269:29.30]Which one of these is real?
[269:30.40]I promise one day I will do a character that's on camera that has the Swedish chef hands where it's real arms and hands in gloves and then a puppet for a mouth.
[269:44.74]I promise you one day I will do a bit with that if it shows up.
[269:49.49]Action.
[269:51.81]Don't stop now.
[269:55.01]Don't go away.
[269:58.09]Walk on the spot.
[270:04.80]And action.
[270:07.62]More feeling.
[270:09.30]Put more feeling into it.
[270:14.06]Hear that applause?
[270:15.82]What a moment.
[270:20.30]Don't you know if you do nerd neck far enough, you can do full momentum like an octopus?
[270:32.61]Fat.
[270:35.41]Fat and hat, right?
[270:39.77]Oh, run.
[270:40.49]The fat seems to be running the whole time.
[270:44.37]Only running, apparently.
[270:45.47]Weird.
[270:52.82]Action!
[270:55.60]Run like the wind!
[270:57.10]Keep on running!
[270:58.58]Run, Sparky, run!
[271:00.30]Well done!
[271:00.86]They should use you to power the country!
[271:05.15]It was still going.
[271:25.15]Players two and four, on set now, please.
[271:30.53]Clear the air.
[271:32.57]Just get the smoke out of here.
[271:33.96]I got it.
[271:37.14]Imagine the room is filled with smoke.
[271:39.40]Wave your arms to clear the air before your opponent.
[271:42.38]I'm going to go like this.
[271:43.40]I'm going to go.
[271:47.61]Action.
[271:58.55]Come on!
[272:03.42]You cleared the air.
[272:04.96]You truly are a master.
[272:13.41]Player one, I need you on set, please.
[272:21.36]Somebody asked, when you have kids, are you going to let them watch these streams?
[272:25.36]I'm going to deny this was me.
[272:28.49]I'll look a lot different.
[272:30.27]I'll be old and shit.
[272:32.09]This is not me, kids.
[272:33.65]This is somebody who looks exactly like me.
[272:36.25]I don't know who this person is.
[272:37.83]But God, are they funny.
[272:40.64]I'm honored that you would even compare me to this person.
[272:42.86]Not me, though.
[272:49.85]That's it.
[272:50.95]Keep it going.
[272:55.91]You didn't dig far enough.
[272:59.61]Player three, get your butt on the set.
[273:10.39]We're going to run again?
[273:11.25]I don't want to run with the fucking fat suit on again.
[273:18.06]And now, it's your time to shine!
[273:20.82]There's no scoring, just follow my instructions and act like a star!
[273:29.91]Crack your knuckles like a hoodlum!
[273:33.81]Action!
[273:35.97]Keep it up, keep it up!
[273:39.47]Right!
[273:40.39]Now, try this!
[273:44.63]Look as confused as you can!
[273:50.03]Action.
[273:52.54]Nearly there.
[273:55.66]Let's do another.
[273:58.00]Strut funkily on the spot.
[274:05.56]And action.
[274:09.04]Keep it up.
[274:13.96]You brought the house down.
[274:15.74]Beautiful.
[274:18.83]Player four, you need it on set.
[274:22.82]I'm coming!
[274:24.94]No, I'm coming!
[274:26.38]There we go.
[274:26.94]It's time to put you in the spotlight.
[274:29.83]Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[274:35.19]Give me your most evil laugh.
[274:43.18]That was so fucking bad.
[274:47.49]That was the worst one, yeah.
[274:49.45]You can tell I'm running out of steam.
[274:50.65]Raise your eyebrows and look from side to side.
[274:56.84]Action!
[275:00.12]Keep it going!
[275:04.58]That was fantastic!
[275:06.62]You were a star!
[275:10.35]That was four and a half hours.
[275:11.99]I can't fucking believe it.
[275:19.79]It's time for your starring moment.
[275:22.22]There's no scoring.
[275:23.54]Follow my instruction and act your heart out.
[275:28.32]Give me your most shocked expression.
[275:30.54]Action.
[275:37.28]Keep rolling, baby.
[275:40.89]That could be a pretty good puppeteer, I think.
[276:14.82]Shito is so talented.
[276:19.04]Here we go.
[276:20.64]Last scenes here.
[276:21.86]I have no idea.
[276:23.82]I don't even know who I picked.
[276:29.60]It's digging time.
[276:31.40]Shake the jackhammer handles as hard as you can to drill.
[276:40.51]And action!
[276:49.62]That's it.
[276:50.72]Keep it going.
[276:57.30]Keep it up.
[276:57.74]I don't want to move my hands like this anymore.
[277:02.66]You didn't dig far enough.
[277:12.59]This is unbelievable.
[277:14.35]Player one, come to the set, please.
[277:16.73]Cheat up.
[277:27.80]Run as fast as you can!
[277:30.26]Reach the gate to escape the charging bull!
[277:38.79]Action!
[277:43.79]He sure got a mean look about him, don't he?
[277:47.39]Get those arms moving to gain speed!
[277:59.08]I thought I was gonna have to do the little, like, puppeteering legs, but no.
[278:04.29]Damn it.
[278:06.69]A lot of running.
[278:12.63]Is that it?
[278:14.54]No.
[278:15.46]There's gonna be a lot of chase scenes in this fucking movie.
[278:20.28]Right?
[278:20.60]See?
[278:20.80]Look at this.
[278:21.98]Another one.
[278:23.50]Run for your life!
[278:25.04]It's a tornado!
[278:26.44]Run as fast as you can to get away!
[278:35.16]And... action!
[278:36.18]Not gonna do this for 15 seconds!
[278:42.33]It's gaining on you!
[278:43.41]I heard a bad wind, but this is ridiculous!
[278:51.96]What a runner!
[278:52.82]Just get me, get me!
[278:53.40]You made it to the cave!
[279:09.13]Player four, come to the set please.
[279:11.39]God dammit.
[279:13.79]This has been like 25 scenes.
[279:16.88]Dance to the music as a bank robber?
[279:18.90]A bank robber dancing to the music?
[279:20.04]Burn, baby, burn.
[279:21.40]It's time to stretch your funky stuff.
[279:24.14]Dance to the music and match the position of the hands to pose.
[279:30.77]Action!
[279:31.71]Party!
[279:37.68]Work that booty, work that booty.
[279:45.58]Let the music take over.
[279:50.50]Can you feel it?
[279:52.48]Gotta take it higher.
[279:59.60]Let your feet do the talking.
[280:02.12]That was some performance.
[280:04.11]Great with a capital move there.
[280:06.87]I'm not gonna... That thing that people want me to do.
[280:12.29]Player one, to the set.
[280:21.36]I came kind of close.
[280:22.36]I didn't do it.
[280:22.82]I came close.
[280:24.38]It's time to put you in the spotlight.
[280:27.28]There's no scoring.
[280:28.52]Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.
[280:34.34]Swim to the surface.
[280:40.96]Action.
[280:43.38]Alright.
[280:46.62]And another.
[280:49.03]Walk on the spot, looking around you.
[280:55.69]Action.
[280:57.91]That's it.
[280:58.97]Keep it going.
[281:01.52]One more.
[281:04.70]Wave your arms in complete panic.
[281:11.22]And action.
[281:14.38]That's it.
[281:19.67]You brought the house down.
[281:20.95]Beautiful.
[281:21.73]It's the same image three times.
[281:26.24]Here's the time.
[281:26.82]That's a wrap, folks.
[281:28.20]I'm ready.
[281:34.38]Here we go.
[281:38.67]Fix the green screen?
[281:40.73]Did I fuck it up?
[281:42.11]I'll do it after.
[281:49.94]Yeah, the running movie.
[281:52.88]Wouldn't be surprised.
[282:07.29]Scared witness.
[282:09.49]What?
[282:19.40]There are no perfect crimes.
[282:26.25]And when you're the only witness, danger lurks around every corner.
[282:40.94]It's a deadly game.
[282:55.10]Hiding a secret that nobody knows.
[282:57.24]Chased.
[283:00.22]Hunted.
[283:02.58]Excitement lies dead ahead.
[283:26.91]Jeopardy awaits.
[283:30.46]Impending peril.
[283:36.34]Where would you go if you, over there, yes you, were scared witness?
[283:55.09]Dude, the best part about that movie was the guy eating the stuff out of his arm.
[283:58.82]They used it like four times.
[284:05.52]Oh my god.
[284:06.22]Alright, one more.
[284:11.94]I want to count how many times the guy eats stuff and pukes.
[284:39.29]Alright, shh.
[284:54.79]Scared witness.
[285:06.93]There are no perfect crimes.
[285:13.75]And when you're the only witness, danger lurks around every corner.
[285:28.44]It's a deadly game.
[285:42.57]hiding a secret that nobody knows.

[287:28.43]Alright, for this next one, I'm gonna get really close.
[287:32.07]It's just gonna be a close up of my face for every scene.
[287:35.99]And whatever the other actors do, that's fine.
[287:54.50]don't look at the camera so much.
[287:55.44]Well, I have to look at the screen because it's like, hey, punch this thing!
[287:58.27]And I obviously have to look to see where it is.
[288:05.05]I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna sit in my chair.
[288:15.00]Should I just read?
[288:17.18]I'm just gonna read, like, the manual from this game.
[288:34.97]Who told Scarlett O'Hara that she should be kissed often by somebody who knows how?
[288:39.74]I don't know what movie that is.
[288:40.60]Alright, let me fix the green screen.
[288:50.12]That should be better.
[288:59.20]I'll do another lighting check.

[289:51.03]I'm going to get full body me reading.
[289:55.88]Should I do it?
[289:56.40]I feel like I'm going to do four, but just sit here as me every time.
[290:02.11]Well, no, just one.
[290:04.79]They take a long time.

[300:37.12]I went over to check in on the stream here.
[300:41.06]I'm noticing that the same percentage of people left during this segment when it was actually live.
[300:47.00]Also, when it was not live.

[315:54.68]I'm going all out with this one.
[316:00.94]Spiders from space.
[316:03.82]Let's check our equipment is working correctly.
[316:06.25]Is the picture in focus?
[316:08.51]Is the lighting okay?
[316:10.79]Now, let's position the camera.
[316:13.17]Make sure everyone can... Welcome to the cut-out studio.
[316:19.05]Great.
[316:20.07]Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.

[316:40.72]Not much I can do about that.
[316:50.68]Anything after this?
[316:51.44]I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the bits after this.
[316:53.82]We got a lot to go through.
[316:55.74]So, this will probably take us to like five and a half, six hours.
[316:58.06]And then after that, the bits will probably be half an hour to forty minutes.
[317:03.00]So we'll get from about six to seven hours.
[317:05.84]Alright.
[317:06.62]I think it's the light.
[317:07.96]There's not enough light in the room right now.
[317:10.23]But, whatever.
[317:11.67]I'm gonna do five.
[317:12.87]There are four!
[317:19.70]Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.
[317:23.24]This will decide which role you play in the movie.
[317:27.16]It doesn't matter.
[317:27.72]Just get them all.
[317:34.75]If the picture is okay, press A to continue.
[317:39.29]Let's do it.
[317:40.75]Spider is in my attic.

[317:54.46]I know that.
[317:55.92]The light sucks.
[317:58.38]It's time to act like a clown with a bungee run.
[318:01.55]Now run as far as you can before the power of the bungee drags you back.
[318:05.63]The sun's going down, so let's screw this whole thing up.
[318:10.54]Action.
[318:11.58]Get those arms moving to gain speed.

[318:46.05]The more you beat, the more you score.
[318:48.99]Remember, if you don't beat the target, you won't score any points.
[318:53.57]Action!
[318:54.23]Shit, it's so fucked up, it's getting too dark.
[318:59.89]Faster!

[337:03.55]We can get the rest with stock footage and body doubles.
[337:07.51]That's what I'm doing.
[337:08.01]I'm just giving you stock footage.
[337:08.97]That's all this is.
[337:10.22]Player four, get your foot on the set.

[339:39.58]Give me your most shocked expression.
[339:46.52]Action.

[340:20.59]That's it?
[340:20.81]That's a wrap.
[340:21.97]That's the final one.
[340:23.15]Alright, get me out of this suit.
[340:35.93]Here's the last one of the night.
[340:57.45]spiders from space no one could have dreamt such an eerie event could occur here on our own planet Earth but they came they fed
[341:30.42]They spun their meticulous webs!
[341:34.08]Run for your lives!
[341:36.97]They're freakish!
[341:59.98]They're brutish.
[342:04.72]They're certainly fursuit.
[342:13.20]They're spiders from space.
[342:25.23]Where was the eating thing?
[342:29.56]You can tell, like, where these are going.
[342:33.64]It started, like, the first, like, seven were like, wow, I'm, like, really into it.
[342:37.42]And, like, these last ones have been just so phoned in.
[342:41.85]The last two especially.
[342:44.79]They didn't even use the footage of me eating all the fucking stuffing.
[342:49.83]Nah, we're gonna watch them all.
[342:51.41]I'm gonna save it.
[343:00.77]Maybe when they're saved, they won't lag.
[343:12.22]Oh my goodness, that was fucking fun.
[343:15.58]That was absolutely worth playing.
[343:17.24]That was worth buying a 360 and an Xbox Live Vision camera.
[343:23.49]So...
[343:25.15]best part about having a 360 still after this because I bought it for this game I bought a connect and I bought about 30 to 40 games there's gonna be a week maybe two weeks worth of connect games I got so many oh yeah I got connect Star Wars absolutely
[343:56.47]Every Kinect game you can think of that you think is worth playing, I have it.
[344:03.58]Restart the console?
[344:04.40]Yeah, I'll do that too.
[344:08.10]I'm going to Red Ring this Xbox.
[344:13.11]Did I get Twister?
[344:13.93]Yes, I did.
[344:27.17]No Kinect games are worth playing.
[344:30.58]That's true.
[344:33.64]Well, some of them are.
[344:37.48]I think there's at least a handful that might be worth playing.
[344:48.83]Star Wars Kinect Dancing.
[344:51.49]I don't think I have that one.
[344:56.77]connectable uh connectimals yes I have that too that's the only good one so we will go through I'm gonna assume I wanted a whole stream for this game because obviously I felt like there was a lot to explore when there was
[345:26.18]I do have Rise of Nightmares.
[345:27.42]I also have Hunt.
[345:40.75]Yeah, I got them all.
[345:41.37]Alright, let's take... I'm going to restart the 360.
[345:53.46]should have about 11 or 12 to watch start to finish here we go hello everybody it's present day Jeremy here uh after these play out this is the end of the stream this is going to be the end we're going to watch all of them in a row
[346:21.11]And that's where it's going to be.
[346:23.03]In about 15 minutes, the stream is going to end.
[346:26.99]I will see you guys again.
[346:29.71]We're probably going to do a couple more of these before I come back.
[346:36.70]At least probably two or three more.
[346:39.58]The next one that we're probably going to do is The Sims 4.
[346:44.52]The first Sims 4.
[346:45.72]Sims 4 Murder House.
[346:53.13]And if it's more than one or two streams, what's probably going to end up happening is they'll be, let's say it's two or three six to seven hour streams.
[347:05.62]I'm probably just going to smash them up back to back.
[347:09.62]So if it's two six hour streams or three, four, five, six hour streams, I'm probably just going to link them up and just go back to back to back.
[347:21.45]But I'm going to let this play out.
[347:23.33]I'll say goodbye.
[347:24.11]You're going to watch the... I guess we're going to watch all the movies that were there for today.
[347:30.29]And I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[347:32.07]In like 10, 15 minutes.
[347:32.77]I'm so tired.
[347:39.10]I am trashed right now.
[347:41.10]Not even alcohol.
[347:42.10]I'm just saying.
[347:42.76]I'm out.
[347:48.21]How many different...
[347:52.16]I feel like I want to do these at some other point.
[347:54.92]There's like six or seven more that I think I want to do.
[347:59.62]Steal the day.
[348:05.49]Some of these look fun.
[348:07.81]But let's go to the movie theater.
[348:15.35]Watch a movie from the run of the night.
[348:16.67]Not yet, not yet.
[348:17.81]I'm going to restart the console.
[348:22.64]This thing is on fire.
[348:27.29]Wow.
[348:29.03]This thing is burning up.
[348:33.41]Whoa, easy.
[348:34.41]What the fuck are you doing?
[348:39.13]It just spit the disk at me.
[348:40.34]I didn't do anything.
[348:44.88]I would say this is probably like 250 degrees.
[348:46.82]If I were to take a guess.
[348:50.54]Inside of here if I touched inside of here, I would burn my hand out to go to the hospital If I put my finger inside of this unit Okay, we're starting And here we go What about the bottom of this feels like
[349:17.90]sucks yeah and so earlier today it was it was over probably 100 105 here in Vegas so probably not the best environment for an old 360 but this is one of the newer models this is one of the slim ones they can handle it right okay here we go
[349:58.44]Alright.
[350:00.74]The slim models had overheating problems?
[350:02.45]Uh-oh.
[350:06.21]How bad?
[350:14.58]Welcome to You're in the Movies!
[350:17.16]The game that makes you... Alright, we're gonna watch him start to finish.
[350:29.91]Alright, we're gonna do, this is Who Cares.
[350:32.69]No, no, no, no, that might be, no, we're gonna do Who Cares 2.
[350:35.30]You ready?
[350:42.50]Who Cares?
[350:47.22]Everyone's super.
[350:53.29]Every superhero's super.
[350:56.98]But some are more super than others.
[351:07.77]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[351:15.79]Battles.
[351:17.50]Adventure.
[351:19.38]Breathtaking effects.
[351:23.53]Not a silly costume in sight.
[351:27.17]Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[351:31.81]Rippling muscles.
[351:34.79]Astounding abilities.
[351:37.52]Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[351:40.98]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[351:46.10]Faster than waiting for a bus.
[351:52.13]So when you're feeling low, remember, everyone's super.
[352:02.71]Well, that was the first one and it was dog shit.
[352:06.35]Here's Who Cares 3.
[352:07.55]I don't remember which one this one was.
[352:16.43]It was a day like any other day.
[352:21.16]until a terrible accident created a horrifying atomic monster cold-blooded watch in terror as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc I'm trying to dodge the laser created by nature twisted by science
[352:48.91]No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it.
[352:56.68]Can anything stop this Leviathan?
[353:01.90]Can mankind use science to fight nature with nature?
[353:08.22]Feel your blood run cold.
[353:14.37]Cold-blooded.
[353:18.79]Okay, that one actually sucked.
[353:23.98]That one was just stupid.
[353:27.18]The lizard was the best character in that whole trailer.
[353:29.66]It wasn't me.
[353:35.44]Here's Mimi and me.
[353:40.40]Me, me, and me.
[353:44.91]Today is a day you'll never forget.
[353:52.94]Somewhere, at some point in time, in a secret location, the boundaries of science are being stretched beyond breaking point.
[354:09.74]Through the miracle of science, you could find yourself becoming more.
[354:21.67]Much more.
[354:24.54]Loads more.
[354:26.92]And then some.
[354:29.85]So, when you're in a pickle, there's only one person you can count on.
[354:35.77]You, and you, and you.
[354:39.25]The thing, the algorithm making everybody fat is just fucking too funny.
[354:48.32]Oh, man.
[354:54.53]Here comes the murder mansion.
[354:59.67]Dial M for a menu.
[355:02.93]Today's meal is murder.
[355:09.79]There's plenty to eat when murder's on the menu.
[355:15.69]Murder at the mansion.
[355:18.47]Everyone has a motive.
[355:27.41]everyone has a secret everyone is a suspect who has the last laugh when a joke goes too far but who is to blame who is guilty of
[355:56.81]Murder at the mansion No, I would not like to see it again This one I think is my favorite I think love story is my favorite there's so much going on in this one I Love all of them equally, but I think this one might be the best one just because it's a fucking all over the place.
[356:21.78]I
[356:27.34]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[356:32.20]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[356:43.09]A little romance, excitement, and security is what we're all looking for.
[356:57.97]and if it doesn't work out we try again and again but sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think
[357:25.28]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[357:29.92]That's my favorite.
[357:35.13]I love that one.
[357:38.07]The best part is the picture of the naked fat guy, right?
[357:42.17]That's your picture.
[357:45.06]That's what you have for a photo and then show up naked too.
[357:51.16]the front door and it's like that oh my god wow you're so so dashing this is the private eye one I think this one was pretty good too private eye it was a quiet day for crime
[358:18.26]Then bad news walked in.
[358:25.27]Everyone wants to play the field.
[358:31.29]And no one wants to get caught.
[358:35.63]Love can make us do terrible things.
[358:39.17]Diabolical dancing.
[358:42.06]Sensational scandal.
[358:45.81]Most people want one of two things, love or money.
[358:54.70]Some want both.
[358:59.12]Before you act on your suspicions, get yourself some proof.
[359:04.58]Get yourself a private eye.
[359:13.31]okay so the first my favorite part is the first scene the private eye is sitting there and the door opens he's crying before somebody like a customer comes in and he has to shape up real quick one more I can see that again private eye it was a quiet day for crime then bad news walked in
[359:46.98]Everyone wants to play the field.
[359:50.46]And no one wants to get caught.
[359:57.33]Love can make us do terrible things.
[360:00.89]Diabolical dancing.
[360:03.77]Sensational scandal.
[360:07.53]Most people want one of two things.
[360:10.37]Love or money.
[360:16.40]some want both before you act on your suspicions get yourself some proof get yourself a private eye I mean that's kind of bad like back to back these are like just I can't pick one I can't pick which one's better
[360:42.09]I think it ha- it's probably a love story though, it's just pretty good.
[360:44.99]Let me say it again.
[360:45.59]I'll just say it one more time and then we'll move on.
[360:50.23]Looking for love is a tricky business.
[360:55.13]Having a best friend can make it harder.
[360:58.88]A little romance, excitement, and security
[361:11.79]is what we're all looking for.
[361:20.89]And if it doesn't work out, we try again.
[361:24.35]And again.
[361:39.79]But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.
[361:48.18]Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.
[361:52.84]It's like a computer put it together.
[361:55.62]It's not even, it's like just stock footage in a computer.
[362:07.79]God.
[362:12.78]The computer did put it together.
[362:13.94]Yeah, that's true.
[362:15.00]But this is the dinosaur one.
[362:17.26]These next three are fucking horrible.
[362:19.16]But we're going to watch them anyways.
[362:22.90]It's like talk to Transformer.
[362:27.16]It started with a meeting of great minds.
[362:35.06]And a plan to travel to a lost world.
[362:41.28]Journey to a land never beheld by man, woman, nor child.
[362:48.30]Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before.
[362:53.74]Prehistoric Paradise.
[362:59.79]Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities.
[363:03.81]Groundbreaking discoveries.
[363:07.17]Enormous eggs.
[363:14.96]Terrifying monsters!
[363:18.55]Older than your dreams, scarier than your nightmares!
[363:24.33]A daring rescue mission!
[363:26.87]Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is Prehistoric Paradise.
[363:33.18]It's like your actor was so bad that they just got like drunk on set every day and they didn't even do their lines.
[363:41.76]So you had to piece something together.
[363:43.18]What?
[363:44.32]You already were halfway through making the whole movie.
[363:52.91]Vampire.
[363:53.45]I don't remember Vampire.
[363:54.47]I don't even remember this one.
[363:57.74]Oh yeah, the Scooby Doo run.
[363:59.28]This one is the most coherent, I think.
[364:01.48]It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.
[364:04.62]It turned into a holiday from hell.
[364:13.23]Gaze in horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night.
[364:19.37]This is the vacation to end all vacations.
[364:24.95]You won't be able to leave.
[364:30.08]Will anyone hear you scream?
[364:31.72]There's loads of excitement.
[364:39.80]But be sure not to lose your head.
[364:50.84]Have your friends for dinner.
[364:53.62]Literally.
[365:05.14]So, if you feel the life being sucked out of you, it's time for a vampiric vacation.
[365:20.88]I like this one, but I like one part.
[365:22.76]There's only one part I like.
[365:23.60]When they're at the dinner table, and the robe guy has a wine glass in his hand, and he's just over-animated and over-enunciating.
[365:33.63]I just want to see it one more time.
[365:36.23]It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.
[365:41.45]It turned into a holiday from hell.
[365:46.35]Watch the dinner.
[365:47.94]Gaze in horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night.
[365:54.11]This is the vacation to end all vacations.
[365:59.69]You won't be able to leave.
[366:04.82]Will anyone hear you scream?
[366:10.82]There's loads of excitement.
[366:13.74]But be sure not to lose your head.
[366:25.58]Have your friends for dinner.
[366:28.33]Literally.
[366:29.63]That's when I tried to rip through it.
[366:36.65]It didn't work.
[366:39.87]So, if you feel the life being sucked out of you, it's time for a vampiric vacation.
[366:55.58]Alright.
[366:59.28]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[367:01.88]Uh, witnesses.
[367:03.16]Oh, this is the one with Shido.
[367:04.73]Oh, this is the one with the eating.
[367:07.03]This is the eating.
[367:07.61]Oh, I love this one.
[367:08.75]This one actually might be my favorite.
[367:10.15]It's tough.
[367:10.87]Because it's so fucking... Scared witness.
[367:14.45]There are no perfect crimes.
[367:25.74]And when you're the only witness, danger lurks around every corner.
[367:38.07]It's a deadly game when you are running for your life.
[367:47.22]Hiding a secret that nobody knows.
[367:54.32]Chased.
[367:57.14]hunted excitement lies dead ahead jeopardy awaits impending peril where would you go if you over there yes you were scared witness
[368:31.01]And then I did an even better one.
[368:32.59]And this next one, when I stuffed the whole thing in my mouth and they didn't even use it.
[368:35.79]They didn't even use any of it.
[368:38.59]Deity.
[368:40.27]Oh, right.
[368:41.10]The book one.
[368:49.14]Deity for a day.
[368:54.77]Feeling washed up.
[368:58.71]Life got you beat.
[369:05.06]Seeing things again?
[369:07.40]Why not get away?
[369:12.48]And lose yourself in Paradise.
[369:23.57]Meet new friends.
[369:27.75]Dance with the natives.
[369:30.33]Eat fantastic feasts.
[369:33.78]And if you ever get homesick, a warm welcome awaits you.
[369:39.27]Deity for a deity.
[369:52.05]Will you ever tire of being admired?
[370:06.42]This is the one that was just... I was done.
[370:08.76]I was done.
[370:09.20]I was done doing this.
[370:14.39]God.
[370:22.61]The last one is Spider.
[370:29.19]When did the book just come out of my nose?
[370:32.13]When did that even happen?
[370:33.13]No one could have dreamt
[370:35.71]Such an eerie event could occur.
[370:41.15]Here, on our own planet Earth.
[370:45.25]But they came.
[370:47.87]They fed.
[370:55.44]They spun their meticulous webs.
[371:02.34]Run for your lives!
[371:06.59]They're freakish.
[371:08.91]Where does this mean?
[371:10.57]There it is.
[371:12.39]They're brutish.
[371:14.17]Can we just slow-mo on that?
[371:17.00]Can we just slow-mo on that?
[371:23.56]They're spiders from space.
[371:44.14]oh my god oh who cares one I think it's just it's just the superhero one but I might be naked let me see
[372:14.63]A superhero's super.
[372:18.07]But some are more super than others.
[372:28.77]And where there are heroes, there are villains.
[372:32.94]I don't think I've been in this for more than a second.
[372:34.96]Yeah, I tested it.
[372:37.44]I think I'm only in two machines.
[372:40.24]Breathtaking effects.
[372:44.35]Not a silly costume in sight.
[372:47.97]Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?
[372:52.61]Rippling muscles.
[372:55.59]Astounding abilities.
[372:58.25]Fiercer than a ranting mom.
[373:00.28]More courageous than a hungry mouse.
[373:06.74]Faster than waiting for a bus.
[373:12.71]So when you're feeling low, remember, everyone's super.
[373:18.69]From yesterday.
[373:20.19]I'm sorry.
[373:21.03]No, what you're looking at here is you're looking at something I did at least two days ago.
[373:27.62]Yes, so this was the 17th.
[373:32.26]So this was like two or three days ago.
[373:36.92]I told you I was in it.
[373:37.96]What am I going to... This shirt was clean.
[373:39.70]Am I going to wash the shirt?
[373:40.88]I put it on for five seconds.
[373:44.63]I put this shirt on, did the test, and was like, I'm ready to stream, and I couldn't stream.
[373:49.75]That's enough.
[373:50.15]That's enough.
[373:50.85]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[373:54.76]That's enough of that.
[373:56.10]It's dirty now.
[373:56.96]Oh, absolutely.
[373:58.28]You better believe it.
[373:59.24]Okay.
[374:00.36]Very nice.
[374:01.62]So, that's going to conclude this stream.
[374:07.59]Turn him down.
[374:09.75]This coming up here is the bit reading, which...
[374:14.63]is it doesn't make sense to show because it's all completely potentially more than a year old and we are going to go to the outro screen
[374:29.74]What happened to me?
[374:31.48]For those of you that don't know, I'm in the middle of trying to figure out a mystery problem.
[374:35.73]I've been getting kind of just trunk, core, back, and chest pain for like the last year and a half, two years.
[374:44.55]And I've decided that I was going to take some time just to go to the doctor all the time, do a bunch of tests, and really figure out what the fuck is wrong with me.
[374:53.68]We're getting there.
[374:54.20]I have a couple of important results that are coming up this week.
[374:59.55]And this week in particular will be a really, really good indicator of what is actually going on.
[375:07.99]I'm awaiting the results on a bunch of shit.
[375:11.68]And I have an appointment coming up here in the next few days to go over all of it.
[375:17.88]And then we just do another step.
[375:21.44]Let me move this.
[375:24.04]The reason why I'm not streaming is because I'm trying to stay as kind of just chill as I can.
[375:31.81]I've come in here a few times and, you know, I've gotten a little excited.
[375:34.75]But just trying to not do much.
[375:37.03]Turn this off now.
[375:44.46]There we are.
[375:49.27]And I don't want to come back.
[375:51.41]And for those of you that might not have any idea what's really going on, when I sit here in this chair, but when I am in the same place for a long amount of time, I start to lock up and it starts to hurt.
[376:04.06]So I don't want to come back unless I'm ready to come back.
[376:09.13]I don't want to sit here in the chair for more than a few hours and then be like well I'm not healthy so I'm gonna see you later I'll be back in a few weeks while I figure this out no I'm just taking as much time as I need just to get it done get a real diagnosis get it treated and come back at 100 and that's part of the reason why to do these reruns was well it's been four weeks now since I've last done a real stream
[376:38.91]If I'm not going to stream, then why not?
[376:43.38]I did a poll and people voted for some of their favorite streams to do a rerun on.
[376:50.36]And we're going to play some of them.
[376:52.42]This is not going to be something that happens every day.
[376:54.13]I don't want to overdo it.
[376:56.17]Like I said, I don't want this to become like friends.
[376:58.71]I said that the other day.
[377:01.15]Once a week, maybe?
[377:02.03]Once or twice a week?
[377:02.97]Will you see something like this?
[377:05.28]Just so people that couldn't see it before, people that wanted to have chat on the VOD, that type of deal.
[377:15.85]Rerun grab that auto.
[377:18.87]Well, that wasn't a stream, that was a YouTube video.
[377:29.81]rerun sorcery sorcery is probably gonna be the last one sorcery is gonna be long so that that'll be probably the final one before I come back for real because that would make sense right hey let's play one of the first streams I ever did with a real schedule on Twitch to come back to do more right
[378:01.12]How many more reruns am I going to do?
[378:03.19]Um... I don't know.
[378:05.89]I don't really have a number.
[378:06.73]I think until I come back.
[378:10.79]Right?
[378:11.45]Once or twice a week until I come back.
[378:14.98]Now, if you want to do some on the back of the napkin math there, I plan on coming back and being able to stream and starting actual, you know, streaming regularly again.
[378:30.53]in the next couple of weeks so it's somewhere around like July the middle of July like July that week of the 12th of July like the week of the 13th somewhere in that like July 13th to like July 17th is like where I plan on coming back to start streaming for real again
[378:51.64]Now that also is based on what happens over the next few days.
[378:56.30]If I get results back, that's like, wait a minute, Jeremy, we got to do a lot of shit now.
[379:01.56]There's a lot of shit that we have to start doing.
[379:04.62]If I have to take more time to treat whatever's wrong with me, then obviously I'm going to take a little bit more time.
[379:12.17]But if what is going on just requires something simple that I can do over a couple of weeks, then yeah.
[379:18.91]But this week coming up will tell that very, very clearly.
[379:23.59]We'll see.
[379:26.69]But I guess you could say another few times, another like maybe three or four, five times.
[379:32.29]Maybe like another handful of times, three or four times.
[379:39.52]Don't come back.
[379:40.24]We want to watch all your streams again.
[379:43.20]Just don't come back and just rerun old streams forever.
[379:46.69]Nah, I... We'll be good.
[379:58.57]When is the next rerun?
[379:59.94]Probably on Thursday.
[380:00.68]So, Thursday the 2nd.
[380:14.26]Eventually rerun the rerun streams.
[380:16.10]Well, all these rerun streams will probably be deleted when I come back.
[380:21.12]I'm not going to delete them now.
[380:22.74]What's the point?
[380:24.90]But when I come back and I'm streaming again, there's going to be a block of just old reruns in a row that I'm probably just going to remove.
[380:34.94]Because it would be a little odd to have them there.
[380:41.59]But they don't have developer commentary.
[380:47.12]You gonna do Seaman?
[380:48.68]Maybe.
[380:49.40]I don't know.
[380:50.20]I really don't know what I'm gonna run.
[380:51.60]It really depends on... I mean, all the ones that were on that list are potential to be re-ran.
[380:59.38]It's not gonna be a case where just the top six or the top ten get shown.
[381:06.25]A lot of stuff on that list is worth showing, I think.
[381:08.93]A lot of those streams were, I think, really, really fun.
[381:11.91]So it's just gonna come down to what do I want to show.
[381:16.52]And we've already done these two, we're in the top five.
[381:19.22]So, we've got a lot to choose from.
[381:29.37]Lifeline.
[381:31.19]Seaman would be alright.
[381:32.15]I guess Seaman was just one giant, what, 10-hour stream or something?
[381:38.41]Will we ever see two streams in one day?
[381:40.06]Yes.
[381:41.85]If a stream is less than four or five hours and it has a part two, part two will happen immediately after the first one finishes.
[381:49.51]I'll just have it ready to go and I'll just queue it up and I'll make sure it plays.
[381:55.02]Now, if there's... I would probably put a time limit on this for during the day.
[382:03.06]So let's say that in total, if there was going to be 10, 11, 12, 15 hours of stream content back to back,
[382:10.94]I would want to start it, whatever it was, at 10 o'clock in the morning and have it end at 10 o'clock at night.
[382:17.27]Midnight.
[382:17.61]Because I really just don't want to just be streaming reruns through 3, 4, 5, 6 o'clock in the morning.
[382:27.43]I'm not into that.
[382:35.85]It's Teen Titans.
[382:36.80]Teen Titans.
[382:42.46]Just keep the stream on until you come back.
[382:45.02]That would be interesting.
[382:51.48]But I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[382:54.10]It's probably going to be The Sims 4.
[382:55.52]At least part one of The Sims.
[382:57.36]You know, what I'm going to do is I'm going to find which one of those Sims streams was the most ridiculous.
[383:03.79]I'll probably run that one.
[383:05.51]There's a Sims 4 block of streams and then there's like one or two of them that are crazy.
[383:11.17]Just have to figure out which one it is.
[383:14.76]It's probably the first one.
[383:21.80]But I'm going to get going.
[383:23.46]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[383:24.46]Thanks for watching the rerun.
[383:26.71]I try to make it clear that it's a rebroadcast.
[383:31.13]If you thought this was just live, I'm sorry that you got jubated.
[383:41.74]we'll see you soon thanks a lot guys take care of yourselves have a great night see you Thursday you
