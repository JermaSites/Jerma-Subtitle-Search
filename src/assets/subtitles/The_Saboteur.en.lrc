[00:57.33]Nah, I'm kidding.
[00:59.03]Hey.
[01:00.43]How's everybody doing?
[01:01.83]How's everybody doing?
[01:04.53]Let me just move all my words into the same word.
[01:09.40]My motor skills are a little bit slow tonight because I've been drinking a little bit of alcoholic beverages.
[01:15.68]No.
[01:16.24]Hi, guys.
[01:16.48]I'm going to play the Saboteur tonight.
[01:19.26]I'm going to continue our PlayStation 3... Trek...
[01:25.47]Through the madness that is the previous generation.
[01:30.93]Need some milk to counter the alcohol.
[01:36.73]No.
[01:37.01]We got a lot to get through for PlayStation 3.
[01:41.48]But, you know, obviously these are the games that I want to play.
[01:44.64]We will cut in other stuff besides PS3.
[01:46.92]I can guarantee that.
[01:48.02]I can promise you that.
[01:50.68]But let's let the intro play out.
[01:52.16]Let me make a tweet and we will move right to the game.
[01:54.92]Hope you're having a good Friday.
[02:58.81]Okay.
[03:00.65]Let's go ahead and... Give me one second.
[03:03.05]You're going to hear a couple of beeps.
[03:04.31]I apologize for that.
[03:06.99]I'm so sorry about that, folks.
[03:08.80]I'm just going to take care of the beeps here for just a second.
[03:15.82]That's better.
[03:16.42]A little bit less in the ear department for me.
[03:19.82]Which is good.
[03:22.92]Alright.
[03:24.07]Let's move this over.
[03:25.75]Hi.
[03:26.73]Welcome.
[03:28.85]There it is.
[03:29.28]There's the saboteur.
[03:32.84]This is like a... This is like a Hitman game.
[03:36.40]It's like a stealth action game.
[03:39.79]I wanted to play this months ago.
[03:42.38]But never had the opportunity to.
[03:43.98]I had this.
[03:44.46]You can buy this on the good old games.
[03:45.93]Remember the rant.
[03:46.95]The good old games rant.
[03:47.97]Where I was talking shit about good old games.
[03:50.75]It's actually not even a bad website.
[03:52.07]I just.
[03:52.61]I lose my temper sometimes.
[03:53.89]Yeah.
[03:56.75]I was going to play this game.
[03:58.53]Back when I talked about that.
[04:01.27]And apparently the game is very good.
[04:02.61]And it's very fun.
[04:04.05]And there's fucking lightning jump scares.
[04:07.66]I didn't expect that.
[04:10.56]I just got lightning bolted.
[04:13.77]This is not like Hitman.
[04:15.39]Well, the back of the box looked like Hitman.
[04:20.03]So my dumb fucking puny moron brain.
[04:23.52]It's a Hitman game, okay?
[04:30.50]Anyways, let's get started.
[04:34.14]Welcome.
[04:35.00]Enjoy your Friday.
[04:36.18]Crack open a fucking cold one.
[04:37.22]I know I got one, except it's room temperature.
[04:39.81]It's a room temperature cider.
[04:42.95]Yep.
[04:46.59]That's good.
[04:47.57]That's a good setup.
[04:49.43]The game saves data automatically, of course it does.
[04:51.79]Adjust the slider.
[04:54.47]I don't like the whole dark.
[04:58.78]Like when games get really dark.
[05:00.06]Man vs. Wild was fucking dark.
[05:02.40]We're not going down here.
[05:03.22]We're going to go up here.
[05:05.42]Let's go right there.
[05:09.55]Prep the sensor.
[05:10.37]Let's go to options first just to make sure.
[05:11.97]Audio.
[05:13.83]I don't like when the music is like as loud as the other shit too.
[05:18.00]Home theater system, I got my home theater system set up so that's good.
[05:21.30]TV, home theater.
[05:22.74]Wow, there really is no in between here.
[05:25.50]It's just like, alright, here are your two options.
[05:28.04]Like, are you like really well off or are you just a regular person?
[05:34.22]I'm fucking well off.
[05:35.58]Anyways Anyways, let's go to video.
[05:38.41]Gamma correction, don't even do that.
[05:39.59]Gameplay difficulty is automatically set to hard.
[05:44.07]There's hard, and then there's fucking hard.
[05:48.78]Subtitles for... Subtitles on.
[05:53.80]I guess we're going to stay on hard.
[05:55.00]We're not going to go to fecking hard.
[05:57.32]Vibration off.
[05:58.36]No thanks.
[06:02.11]Alright, anyways.
[06:06.38]I don't know how good those are going to be, but that's fine.
[06:08.86]Let's just go back and start the game.
[06:11.30]New game.
[06:12.54]The Saboteur.
[06:14.30]Oh, we actually get to pick.
[06:16.12]We're not going to do casual.
[06:17.10]We're not going to do hard.
[06:18.59]We're going to do normal.
[06:19.31]Okay?
[06:21.27]We're just playing the game.
[06:22.59]We're not going for any high scores.
[06:23.95]I'm not going to impress anybody.
[06:28.17]We're going for lawful neutral.
[06:30.09]Okay?
[06:31.15]Not chaotic evil.
[06:32.37]Not fucking lawful good.
[06:34.96]Fucking neutral evil.
[06:40.18]The Midnight Show downloadable content was not detected.
[06:42.79]Your game box has a ticket inside it with a code that allows you to download the Midnight Show for free.
[06:49.05]The downloadable content will add adult content including nudity, a VIP room, and new hiding spots.

[10:28.72]But if you're keen to get your teeth kicked in, I'll be happy to oblige.
[10:32.28]Am I Irish?
[10:33.20]Nice.
[10:33.48]I'd have thought you were too busy kicking yourself.
[10:36.28]With good reason, I'm sure.
[10:38.47]What's it to you?
[10:40.49]You think you're the only man in Paris hoping to drown a guilty conscience?
[10:44.81]This city is filled with men like us.
[10:47.25]We all have good reasons.
[10:50.31]I've been watching you these past weeks.
[10:52.85]I have seen that you have no love for the Nazis.
[10:55.69]Yeah, okay.
[10:57.56]The question is, how many more people will die at the hands of these jackbooted killers while you sit there cowering like a whipped dog?
[11:06.51]Irish guy.
[11:09.23]That's the medic, by the way.
[11:10.21]That's Robin Akin down there.
[11:11.57]Why is he in every game we've been playing?
[11:32.42]Robert Atkins Downs is literally, was he Man vs. Wild too?
[11:37.11]He's been in every single game.
[11:38.79]That's the medic.
[11:40.55]He's in every fucking game we've been playing.
[11:42.43]Am I Irish?
[11:42.89]Yes, I am.
[11:43.23]Part Irish.
[12:06.14]Alright, so I guess we're gonna stand up.
[12:07.82]Let's get out of here.
[12:10.08]The shield icon.
[12:11.88]Prologue.
[12:12.39]Spark one up.
[12:13.35]Exit the bell.
[12:14.93]Objective marker.
[12:16.15]Head to the yellow pin on the minimap to locate Sean's next objective.
[12:22.01]Well, they're all in the room right here.
[12:23.15]I got a fucking bunch of Nazis in the room right here!
[12:30.36]Okay, there's no punch.
[12:32.35]That's unfortunate.
[12:32.93]Okay, there's no punch.
[12:34.99]I always hope I can't... No punching.
[12:37.25]Okay.
[12:37.95]Let's go.
[12:40.97]Look at all those red Nazi blips.
[12:44.99]Triangle opens the doors.
[12:45.89]Just gotta go end the war right now.
[12:47.80]Like, Hitler's like sitting in the front row.
[12:49.86]Just go punch him in the face and end the war.
[12:51.58]Alright, go meet him over here.
[13:00.30]There's a jump.
[13:02.82]Wait a minute.
[13:03.46]What was that?
[13:04.59]What was I just doing?
[13:06.53]Rendezvous with Luke.
[13:07.33]There he is.
[13:07.71]Why is everything in black and white?
[13:12.51]Did I turn the colors off in the game?
[13:17.61]Wait a minute.
[13:18.13]Hold on.
[13:21.14]I can sneak around like a crab.
[13:24.00]This is a lot of punch combos.
[13:28.05]Alright, that's cool.
[13:28.71]Let's try, let's test it out on this guy.
[13:37.39]Why are we like in darkness?
[13:40.80]What happened?
[13:48.70]What happened to the colors in the game?
[13:52.30]What button did I press?
[13:57.23]Alright, talk to me, and please give me back my color scheme.
[14:02.95]I'd rather the Krauts did the dying.
[14:04.97]Excellent.
[14:06.15]There is a Jerma fuel depot down the street.
[14:09.71]Yeah.
[14:10.43]5,000 barrels of precious petrol, guarded by a handful of half-drunk supply clerks.
[14:16.31]Sounds like one hell of a fire hazard.
[14:18.47]My thoughts exactly.
[14:19.59]We need something to get the fireworks started.
[14:22.13]I know a place where we can get what we need.
[14:24.51]But first I must know...
[14:26.60]Are you prepared to kill if necessary?
[14:29.08]Yes.
[14:29.28]The way I see it, these Nazi bastards bought their own tickets to hell.
[14:33.84]I'm just laying out the welcome mat.
[14:37.00]Alright.
[14:38.00]That's my car there.
[14:39.44]I'll drive.
[14:40.34]I'll drive.
[14:41.70]Remember guys, don't you understand?
[14:44.62]Determine if a game is a good game if there is a car in it.
[14:49.10]And for instance, there's two guys right here.
[14:51.30]Like, this game's already fun.
[14:53.27]Like, I don't even need to move.
[14:55.85]R2 to accelerate, L2 to brake.
[14:57.41]Steer and X2 is the handbrake.
[14:59.71]Like, I don't even need to move the controller.
[15:03.33]Already a good game.
[15:04.41]Like, we've already determined it's a great game.
[15:06.81]Just from that, we already know.
[15:13.56]Car equals fun.
[15:15.50]Go to the supply depot.
[15:17.61]Oh, okay, the supply depot.
[15:21.17]I know, that's the strip club.
[15:23.97]I saw the blip on the screen.
[15:26.71]And... This car is actually kind of hard to drive.
[15:31.21]So I gotta run over the Nazis, right?
[15:36.87]Is this the supply depot?
[15:40.67]Oh shit, no.
[15:43.71]I love how the Nazis are like the fucking police in GTA.
[15:46.65]I know I'm wedged in there.
[15:49.81]Come on, I just ended the war!
[15:51.05]I just ran over Adolf!
[15:53.41]God damn it.
[15:54.59]I really actually can't get out of here.
[15:56.15]I'm perfectly wedged in.
[16:03.43]Okay, we're gonna get out.
[16:07.98]Alright.
[16:08.96]What the fuck?
[16:14.04]Why?
[16:15.86]Why are they throwing grenades over?
[16:18.03]Escape the red circle.
[16:19.39]Get out of the way!
[16:20.07]I'm trying to evade the cops!
[16:26.45]That's so, like... Escape the red circle, yeah.
[16:29.15]And now here come the blips on the mini-map.
[16:32.73]Got away.
[16:33.13]Alright, go to the supply depot.
[16:40.57]Oh, this game.
[16:42.71]The screen tearing I could do without.
[16:44.37]But, you know, that's one problem.
[16:50.92]Shit.
[16:52.00]Excuse me.
[16:52.68]That guy's got his arm up on the seat.
[16:56.30]Like, that was relaxing for him.
[17:01.40]Really sluggish car.
[17:02.44]Alright, can you bail out of cars?
[17:07.09]What happens if I press triangle right now?
[17:10.73]Oh, you actually can.
[17:11.53]Hold on, did that guy just get run over?
[17:13.03]Did somebody just get run over?
[17:14.49]Hold on a minute.
[17:15.39]Who just got run over?
[17:16.77]Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[17:19.97]I'm fucking confused.
[17:21.05]Lady, watch out.
[17:39.23]You're just like standing in the way.
[17:40.43]You can just grab.
[17:41.57]Oh my god.
[17:42.35]This is the best game ever.
[17:44.17]There's literally a fucking grab and throw button.
[17:47.28]Oh shit.
[17:48.12]No.
[17:48.42]Wait.
[17:52.94]I just did.
[17:56.64]I just ultimate warrior pressed that lady.
[17:59.00]I was getting her out of danger.
[18:07.70]Oh my god, I just over the top roped through that lady and eliminated her from the rumble.
[18:13.10]Oh, this game is great.
[18:20.69]Fighting Irish.
[18:21.75]Knock out two Nazis.
[18:23.43]Unlock the haymaker.
[18:24.93]Oh god.
[18:25.91]How do I do a haymaker?
[18:33.33]Holy shit man, this game is gonna be fucking great.
[18:36.56]I love this game already.
[18:39.78]What do we do here?
[18:41.00]Ten fingers?
[18:41.92]The crates are up there, but we need to be careful.
[18:44.82]The supply cache is a restricted area.
[18:47.60]Oh, aye.
[18:48.20]Was that you being careful back in the alley?
[18:50.83]Dude, that scoops lip.
[18:52.39]I can't get over it.
[18:53.41]That overhead press on that lady.
[18:55.35]There's no reason for that.
[18:56.71]I'm a psycho.
[18:57.85]Then we'll have to get rid of that lookout first.
[19:05.63]Great game.
[19:06.47]Oh, I gotta throw him from the roof?
[19:08.42]I can't wait to eliminate this guy.
[19:09.94]He doesn't know this phrase?
[19:10.72]Okay, climb up the building.
[19:27.34]No, just don't grab people.
[19:28.70]I mean, that's gonna be the... The theme of this entire stream, guys, is gonna be... I pick somebody up and throw them somewhere.
[19:35.36]Like, that's good.
[19:35.88]Welcome to the stream.
[19:38.82]Enjoy yourself.
[19:39.52]Enjoy your stay.
[19:41.50]I'm gonna climb up the building.
[19:42.72]How the fuck do I climb up?
[19:45.38]What the fuck?
[19:48.14]What in the name of God is happening?
[19:50.10]Why am I Spider-Man?
[19:53.47]What?! !
[19:57.08]This actually is just Nazi Spider-Man.
[19:59.70]Or anti-Nazi Spider-Man.
[20:12.54]Got him.
[20:13.16]Holy shit.
[20:26.52]Come here, you!
[20:27.48]Come over here, I gotta show you something!
[20:32.00]Look at the Irish!
[20:32.90]I just dropped a guy on his head!
[20:34.68]I stomped on his fucking skull!
[20:37.20]I just love fucking throwing people, this is too much fun.
[20:46.07]Oh, I love it.
[21:00.46]Dynamite, oh man, and there's explosions, there's cars, there's explosives.
[21:09.44]This is the new Batman game.
[21:12.48]There's a sprint.
[21:13.42]Okay, where's the car?
[21:14.36]Right here?
[21:18.32]Where's the car?
[21:21.82]Where is the car?
[21:24.30]Get back in the vehicle.
[21:27.24]What did I do with it?
[21:28.09]Didn't I like fucking ghost ride it?
[21:31.36]Oh, there it is.
[21:32.06]Okay, yeah, I did ghost ride it.
[21:35.85]That works.
[21:37.47]This actually is just Superman, Spider-Man, the video game.
[21:45.57]I did not blow it up.
[21:46.35]It's right here.
[21:51.26]Watch out.
[21:51.84]Get out of the way.
[21:52.72]Alright, let's move.
[21:54.12]So we're going to blow the fuel depot.
[21:55.66]I'm so glad I got a chance to play this game.
[21:58.38]I wanted to play this game like a month or two ago on PC.
[22:00.78]I'm so glad.
[22:01.18]Do these guys attack or something?
[22:02.14]No.
[22:23.20]It's right up here.
[22:24.72]Let's get some air.
[22:27.96]Let's get some air, you know what I mean?
[22:29.38]Every time.
[22:34.55]Every time.
[22:34.93]He's just still talking like nothing happened.
[22:38.07]We both dove out.
[22:50.91]That'll do.
[22:51.99]Start by climbing that building.
[22:53.81]Once you're on the roof, keep your head down.
[22:56.81]I'll wait until the truck explodes.
[22:58.94]Then, use that telephone wire to cross the street into the fuel depot.
[23:03.28]Why am I a circus clown?
[23:03.98]That was almost as fast as I can run, you're right.
[23:16.63]Oh my god, but I got so sucked into this fucking nonsense game Ten minutes ago mostly lost.
[23:24.87]Thanks for the 50 bucks Well since you're about to lose your job as a full-time streamer I might as well make a donation to keep the Jerma not homeless fund

[24:52.65]Let me get this straight.
[24:54.75]One of the writers that used to work at Valve on the Half-Life series made a cryptic, here's the end of the entire story post or something?
[25:04.87]Is it legit?
[25:05.23]Dude, this is some Assassin's Creed building scaling.
[25:13.42]From some random Irish dude.
[25:15.56]Get in position.
[25:18.92]Okay.
[25:21.79]The lead writer.
[25:22.73]Okay.
[25:23.93]As legit as it's ever going to get.
[25:26.56]And the NDA expired.
[25:32.48]The lead writer made a fan fiction.
[25:35.56]Was I supposed to do something?
[25:38.76]Grab onto a zipline.
[25:41.78]Right here?
[25:42.55]How do I grab the zipline?
[25:45.29]Oh, like that.
[25:49.96]That looked like it hurt.
[25:50.70]Sabotage the fuel to dunk its scene.
[25:54.64]How do I, like, sneak?
[25:57.06]Is there a sneak?
[26:00.22]I don't think there's a sneak.
[26:05.21]Alright, find a surface and... Okay, there it is.
[26:14.57]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[26:15.65]Okay.
[26:15.97]So I gotta get out of here now, right?
[26:20.75]No, let's go.
[26:25.15]Aren't I in there?
[26:26.96]I'm inside of here.
[26:32.78]I don't think I survived this.
[26:38.72]Am I dead?
[26:43.73]Pick up Luke, alright.
[26:48.39]Alright, Luke, where are you?
[26:51.87]Come on and get in the car.
[26:54.94]Get in.

[27:22.30]And, like, Epistle 3.
[27:24.28]Oh, that's funny.
[27:25.14]Is that a piano?
[27:25.92]No, it's not.
[27:26.79]I thought that was a piano.
[27:35.67]War never changes.
[27:36.53]Alright, let's do it.
[27:37.07]Let's do the same joke we've done three times now.
[27:38.51]Oh, never mind.

[29:20.86]It's going to be like a naked lady.
[29:27.56]It's currently loading nudity.

[29:47.59]Let's see, I told you, look at this naked girl on screen.
[29:49.78]You're a driver now.
[29:50.90]You want respect on the circuit?
[29:52.50]You gotta stop thinking like a mechanic.
[29:54.94]I'm put on airs like some posh wanker with a silver spoon up me arse?
[29:58.82]No thanks, brother.
[30:02.07]Oh, that's when the picture was taken.
[30:06.39]Morning, beautiful.
[30:08.37]I'm coming along for the race.
[30:10.41]Victoria asked me to take pictures.
[30:14.24]Everybody has such a strong, fake French accent.
[30:18.06]Oh, my sister got all the charm.
[30:20.14]And ze brains.
[30:21.38]And ze brains.
[30:24.53]Your boys have work to do.
[30:26.39]Both of you.
[30:27.55]Say the word, boss.
[30:29.13]Let's get our girl on the trailer.
[30:31.29]I want to be across the border by sundown.
[30:33.48]Oh, no.
[30:35.04]Nice FPS.
[30:38.18]I think they loaded that.
[30:41.12]Ready to move out?
[30:42.22]The truck is loaded and ready to roll.
[30:44.32]The what?
[30:44.70]The Aurora?
[30:45.94]Was this Red Dead Redemption?
[30:47.40]Are you going to do, like, farm missions?
[30:48.88]Veronique and I will ride ahead.
[30:50.66]You boys take the truck and head east to the Jerma border.
[30:53.04]Sure.
[30:53.38]From there, it's a straight shot to South Britain.
[30:55.62]I marked the location on your map.
[30:56.92]Okay.
[31:00.92]Yeah, I was trying to grab him.
[31:02.44]You know I was trying to grab him and throw him, right?
[31:04.16]Come on, Sean, get in.
[31:05.59]Yeah, yeah.
[31:08.45]Let's pick up the fucking toxic waste.
[31:14.55]That was way more violent than I thought it was going to be.
[31:18.73]What's wrong with this guy?
[31:21.24]This guy's like fucking puking over here.
[31:36.25]Oh, come on, really?
[31:37.23]Get... I'm not saying nothing!
[31:45.30]I tried... It just went, like, right through his body.
[31:48.18]Like, I was trying... You know what I was trying to do there?
[31:52.66]Let's go.
[31:57.70]Can't trust those French physics.
[31:59.24]I thought those were cows.
[32:01.31]I thought those were cows.
[32:02.23]We were trying to run over cows.
[32:05.03]Drive to Germany.
[32:06.27]Oh, there you go.
[32:07.25]Here are the cows.
[32:10.43]What the fuck?
[32:13.31]Oh my god.
[32:16.97]I regret it.
[32:17.56]I regret wanting to run over the cows.
[32:19.46]I regret wanting to run over the cows.
[32:20.72]I'm sorry, guys.
[32:21.54]That was, like, actually very bad.
[32:23.68]That was terrible.
[32:24.80]And I'm not going to do that again.
[32:26.30]I promise.
[32:28.02]Unless they get out of the way and then there's nothing I can do about it.
[32:33.91]Well, one of the kids, they have to die.
[32:35.75]There's no other way around it.
[32:44.75]You don't just put them in a slap shop if you bump into them with a car, okay?
[32:48.01]That doesn't happen to animals.
[32:50.61]What the fuck happened to that car?
[32:53.19]But there's more riding on this race than you get in your home knocked off.
[32:58.10]Okay, well that was an interesting play of events there.
[33:00.63]Actually, that guy did have a piano.
[33:01.83]This fucking game is a cartoon, I love it.
[33:03.13]Hold on a second, I need to know.
[33:21.35]These aren't even cows, they're just, they're pasted together.
[33:25.03]They were sewn together with like, just very small thread.
[33:29.71]Come on, let me in there.
[33:30.95]We need to do this for a scientific fucking research.
[33:34.31]Okay.
[33:35.13]Here we go.
[33:36.97]I'm gonna be very fucking careful here.
[33:47.90]That's fucking... I don't care how gruesome that is, that's... That's funny.
[33:51.94]It is.
[33:52.78]You know?
[33:53.76]It just is.
[34:04.93]Okay, let's go.
[34:10.15]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[34:11.61]I'm done.
[34:12.25]I promised you I wasn't gonna do it again, and I did it again.
[34:14.30]So let's go.
[34:19.23]The ride to Germany has been long and full of heinous crime.
[34:25.34]What happens if you punch a cow?
[34:34.77]We're going back.
[34:35.63]We are.
[34:35.89]We're just going to go back for just a minute.
[34:49.26]Don't even fucking tell me this is gonna happen.
[34:52.31]Get back to that pasture that they are.
[34:56.71]Okay.
[34:58.63]Alright, first I was testing to see if I walked into them, if they exploded.
[35:12.68]Okay, here we go.
[35:15.37]Nope.
[35:19.93]Uh, it doesn't seem to do anything.
[35:24.09]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[35:31.23]No, no, no fucking way.
[35:33.69]No, don't, don't, don't do it.
[35:38.19]Don't do it.
[35:42.55]Get out of the way, guy.
[35:43.75]I need to... Jesus Christ!
[35:49.59]Alright, yeah, alright, we got it.
[35:51.49]We got to see it.
[35:52.31]You got to see it.
[35:54.68]You got to see it tapped.
[35:56.46]We've killed more cows than people.
[36:00.10]At this point.
[36:01.58]Throw a guy into the cow.
[36:04.30]No, no, we got to move on.
[36:05.32]We got to play the game.
[36:06.50]This is a video game to play.
[36:08.47]And sometimes what we do on this stream is we get stuck.
[36:12.57]We get stuck and we can't get off.
[36:13.93]We get stuck on the carnival ride and we have...
[36:19.18]We paid in advance 500 times around the carousel.
[36:23.58]You can't get off.
[36:24.14]You've already paid for it.
[36:25.26]You already paid for the ride.
[36:26.42]You're not gonna get off the ride.
[36:28.70]Especially if it was like 20 bucks a ride.
[36:32.00]But that's implying that this was like 20 bucks for like one minute of gameplay.
[36:35.53]It's not.
[36:35.87]This game was like 18 bucks.
[36:37.91]How much was this game?
[36:39.43]That's like, it's like four cents for one ride.
[36:42.65]That doesn't matter any.
[36:43.23]That would be like, who cares?
[36:44.29]What's the blip over there?
[36:46.33]What are these blips?
[36:48.60]Are those Nazi tents?
[36:51.49]I guess so.
[36:56.09]Good soundtrack.
[37:00.96]Going a little too fast, but you know, whatever.
[37:02.34]Am I going to actually race this car?
[37:04.92]That would be fun.
[37:09.16]Downhill.
[37:12.93]Oh, you know, I was trying to just dump him off the cliff.
[37:30.57]Stop the car and wait for the Nazi officer to inspect the papers.
[37:33.85]Okay.
[37:37.41]Get past the border checkpoint.
[37:38.91]Do I need to get out of the car?
[37:39.97]See one of those nuns over there?
[37:44.30]What the f- What is going on over there?
[37:45.60]There's like nuns!
[37:46.82]Thank you.
[37:47.34]Alright, watch out for the candy cane outhouse.
[37:55.30]Yeah, you get out.
[37:56.68]No, you don't.
[37:57.42]No, I can't get out.
[37:58.87]We gotta, we gotta... Look, we're gonna get our revenge here.
[38:07.79]What is here?
[38:08.49]What's going on?
[38:09.13]Is somebody in like a treehouse?
[38:10.49]What?
[38:11.09]What is up here?
[38:11.73]There's a guy up here.
[38:12.73]This guy's not going to follow me up there, is he?
[38:14.48]This is really far off.
[38:31.29]I can't put a foot right when she's around.
[38:33.01]Hey, it's not just you.
[38:34.35]We're still talking.
[38:35.87]What do we have here?
[38:46.60]Can pigs fly?
[38:47.48]Okay, I was not expecting the face plant.
[39:02.69]I was not expecting the faceplant.
[39:07.51]Hey watch out!
[39:08.07]You have to be careful!
[39:08.91]There is a fucking lake over here!
[39:11.67]Oh god dammit.
[39:13.75]Joke fucking ruined.
[39:25.92]You fucking crazy American!
[39:36.48]Okay, let's go.
[39:38.68]Did he just say something about vinegar?
[39:44.59]Alright, we tried and we failed.
[39:46.41]This is drive-thru.
[39:50.47]Oi, stop that!
[39:58.00]Alright, let's do the checkpoint.
[39:59.53]God damn it!
[40:00.37]I can't help it!
[40:01.67]I can't play these games!
[40:03.45]I can't do it!
[40:04.05]You know how much trouble I have playing these fucking games!
[40:06.75]You know what happens!
[40:08.01]I just can't stop it!
[40:09.49]I don't stop!
[40:10.17]There's no stopping this shit!
[40:13.27]Give me this gun!
[40:14.18]Give me the rifle!
[40:19.10]First gun of the game!
[40:22.90]How do I shoot the gun?
[40:26.06]How do you shoot the gun?
[40:32.52]Hide!
[40:33.00]Hide with the nuns!
[40:34.06]They never shoot into a crowd of nuns!
[40:37.80]Oh shit.
[40:42.95]Knocked off his hat.
[40:52.42]Yeah, I might fucking throw him on his neck.
[40:54.28]Hey.
[40:55.44]Hey, how's that for a checkpoint?
[41:04.62]Open the fucking gate.
[41:08.39]There it is.
[41:09.13]Come on, Sean, get in.
[41:10.77]Yeah, yeah.
[41:12.71]Checkpoint.
[41:22.10]Is there a button?
[41:23.22]There's a button right here, right?
[41:25.72]There it is.
[41:28.24]See?
[41:28.32]I guess I thought that was going to be difficult.
[41:33.46]Easy.
[41:36.14]I don't think they're gonna let you in.
[41:38.91]Alright, get in buddy.
[41:39.85]Let's go.
[41:44.28]It's hard, huh?
[41:47.50]Run over the nuns?
[41:48.38]What do you think I am?
[41:49.22]Some type of fucking animal?
[41:51.81]You think I'm going to run over the nuns?
[41:54.21]Come on, guys.
[41:54.63]We have to have at least a shred of dignity here.
[41:57.45]How do I shoot that gun?
[41:58.47]I have a gun.
[41:58.97]There it is.
[41:59.27]There's a guy up there.
[42:07.36]How do you... How do you... Okay, it's L1.
[42:10.06]L1 and what, R1, I'm gonna assume?
[42:10.94]That's a very weird combination.
[42:11.96]There he is, let's get him.
[42:12.82]Oh, you dickhead.
[42:31.23]Let's just say it was not your typical upbringing.
[42:34.51]Sounds like fun.
[42:35.37]Please don't ring around the rosy with me here.
[42:36.99]My friend, you have no idea.
[42:51.04]That guy fucking bounced like a bouncy ball.
[42:54.54]I didn't even think I hit him.
[43:02.55]Oh, that was perfect.
[43:10.09]Oh man, what a great game.
[43:13.20]Oh, what a classic.
[43:14.92]See if he's okay.
[43:16.04]The noise that made too was brutal.
[43:24.45]That was like throwing off a sack of shit.
[43:26.65]You know what I mean?
[43:27.17]That was just a loud... Like somebody threw a bunch of pots and pans out of a fucking five-story window.
[43:35.78]Nobody saw that guy fall out.
[43:38.80]Bullshit.
[43:41.02]That was just loud.
[43:41.68]That was like a fucking M-80.
[43:43.66]Everybody in this town heard that shit.
[43:47.52]He jumped off.
[43:48.50]I wouldn't be surprised.
[43:49.30]And there's a tank here.
[43:50.48]Oh, yeah.
[43:50.88]What is this?
[43:51.14]Like a futuristic tank.
[43:52.32]It has like an eye.
[43:52.98]It has like a visor.
[43:56.03]Oh, no, I think that's just a little limp.
[44:00.07]Ugh.
[44:03.29]Drive with a red aux bar.
[44:05.51]You got it.
[44:10.74]Nobody heard the gun, the gunshots, or the fucking M-80 that exploded when he landed.
[44:15.44]Alright, watch out, guy with the briefcase.
[44:19.62]Get out of the way!
[44:20.24]What's the horn?
[44:23.26]Out!
[44:24.43]That's my, that's my circle that I need to get into!
[44:27.51]Thank you.
[44:31.10]Vittor is waiting for you at the bar down the street.
[44:34.88]Old friends, new enemies.
[44:35.76]Leave the truck with us.
[44:36.60]Meet Vittor at the bar.
[44:38.86]Toggle sprint.
[44:39.68]We gotta go this way.
[44:43.10]Hmm, sure thing.
[44:46.12]Road trip.
[44:46.90]Okay, in here.
[44:51.97]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[44:53.57]Okay.
[44:54.23]You're not as safe as you think you are when you jump on cars.
[44:56.55]I was trying to go for the Spider-Man move that I already went and tried to do.
[45:00.55]Apparently, that don't work.
[45:05.62]Oh, Jesus.
[45:06.26]That's loud.
[45:06.70]Okay.
[45:07.56]Oh, it's going.
[45:10.40]Everything is so violent.
[45:11.76]I know.
[45:12.06]It's perfect.
[45:16.14]Thank you, Captain Spurt, for the 25 bits.
[45:17.74]Cutscene.
[45:24.98]No sex scene.
[45:27.20]I'm glad you finally decided to join us.
[45:29.78]We took the scenic routes.
[45:32.52]You run into any trouble?
[45:34.87]Just the usual groupies.
[45:36.43]Looking for autographs.
[45:39.49]Give us your best Jerma accent.
[45:43.49]It would be borderline offensive.
[45:45.81]It would be so poorly done.
[45:47.35]I'm not even going to try.
[45:53.38]Another round.
[45:53.94]I gotta hear a guy talk first.
[45:55.94]There's an 80s movie villain in this.
[46:14.10]Is this, like, the other guy?
[46:15.18]Is this, like, the guy that, like, is also racing?
[46:16.98]That's the bad guy?
[46:17.80]That's, like, the mean guy that's gonna try a bunch of tricks during the race?
[46:22.04]Always a pleasure to welcome one of our Italian friends to the fatherland.
[46:26.95]He's the bad guy race guy that, like, fucks you up during the race.
[46:33.19]A kindred spirit to our own Fuhrer.
[46:36.01]Your country is fortunate to have such a leader, yeah?
[46:40.57]Racing is my passion.
[46:42.65]I find little time for politics.
[46:45.79]Sometimes, racing is politics.
[46:49.97]No, there's a difference.
[46:53.03]You must forgive my ignorance, Herr Morini.
[46:56.37]The Germans are a sinful people.
[46:59.04]Perhaps you would enlighten us further?
[47:02.60]You don't fuck with the Irish guy.
[47:04.78]You can't get laid without a flashy car and a silly uniform.
[47:08.99]You don't fuck with the Irish drunk guy.
[47:10.89]That's me.
[47:12.31]British?
[47:14.43]Excuse me.
[47:15.21]Yeah, excuse me.
[47:16.47]The night is young and full of tellers.
[47:29.06]I've no taste for Jerma cuisine.
[47:31.82]Not yet, perhaps.
[47:34.20]But soon, the women of your country will learn to savor the taste of a purebred Jerma bratwurst.
[47:42.20]Bastard!
[47:46.45]Oh, here we go.
[47:46.91]I told you I was going to kick these guys' asses.
[47:48.57]Watch this one.
[47:49.71]You want to see a fucking move?
[47:52.99]Get behind that bar, you fucking wanker.
[47:56.41]You too.
[47:57.15]Follow your twin brother over there.
[47:59.98]Let's drag his face across.
[48:01.18]Let's do like a cartoon move.
[48:02.34]Let's drag his face across all the bottles.
[48:06.76]Yeah.
[48:08.42]And by the way, eat shit.
[48:11.54]There's more.
[48:12.08]There's more like random red shirts.
[48:15.70]What are you guys, some fucking thriller?
[48:19.78]Get the fuck out of here.
[48:20.66]What the hell is this?
[48:23.90]Who are you?
[48:26.66]I think I just beat up my dad.
[48:28.19]Isn't that the dad?
[48:29.21]That was the dad, right?
[48:30.59]Oh, Jesus.
[48:32.81]I really didn't mean to beat up the dad.
[48:40.19]I think I accidentally beat up one of my own.
[48:43.75]Oh, shit.
[48:44.19]Wait, not this guy.
[48:45.53]It's a random guy.
[48:47.85]Where's this guy that's still alive back here?
[48:49.87]Yeah, you know what?
[48:51.71]Fuck this.
[48:52.39]You don't fuck with me.
[48:53.65]This is where we bring out the gun.
[49:17.40]Oh, that poor guy.
[49:18.34]Oh, that... No, that poor guy!
[49:19.78]What am I talking about?
[49:20.76]For a second, I thought that was the bartender.
[49:25.38]No, that wasn't the bartender.
[49:27.20]I thought that was the bartender, but no, that was the bad guy.
[49:29.48]I had it right, okay?
[49:30.91]Jesus Christ.
[49:33.91]Alright, let's... No, wrong guy again.
[49:37.83]I don't want to... I want to grab these guys.
[49:42.07]I'm not doing any other move.
[49:43.13]We're only doing the throw.
[49:44.57]It's the best move in the game.
[49:46.71]Uh...
[49:48.19]It's too much fun to throw guys overhead like that.
[49:56.44]It's such a wrestling fight.
[49:57.86]I love it.
[49:58.34]It's great.
[49:59.68]Just throw them into each other over here.
[50:02.62]They're like fucking animals in a pen.
[50:05.10]No, you get back in there.
[50:06.20]Break his back.
[50:06.78]Oh, easy.
[50:07.10]Nazi!
[50:20.57]I saw the thing on the uniform.
[50:22.47]I saw the uniform.
[50:25.43]Anymore?
[50:27.45]Anymore Nazis?
[50:31.69]I think we're good.
[50:32.15]Nope.
[50:32.59]Last guy?
[50:33.37]This guy right here.
[50:34.01]Nazi?
[50:35.12]I'm looking for the dead giveaway.
[50:36.96]What's the dead giveaway?
[50:38.40]How can he tell?
[50:41.13]I don't know.
[50:43.11]Are these guys fighting each other?
[50:44.15]Are these guys just in the bar fighting?
[50:45.94]These guys might just be in the bar fighting each other.
[50:48.91]None of these guys are Nazis.
[50:49.85]These guys are just drunks.
[50:52.45]Yeah.
[50:53.51]Thank you.
[50:55.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, why are they just unloading into the... Wait a second!
[51:02.03]Sorry, Jews.
[51:04.83]Wait.
[51:05.65]Wait a minute.
[51:07.87]Did he just... Did he just say... Did he actually just say... Sorry, Jews.
[51:17.39]Did that... Like, let's be real here.
[51:19.32]Did that actually... Did he actually just say that?
[51:24.64]No way.
[51:26.10]I refuse to believe that that's what we just heard on the screen.
[51:31.62]Okay, okay.
[51:34.62]I was gonna say, no fucking way.
[51:36.07]I was gonna be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[51:38.55]Let's get out of here.
[51:58.15]Jules!
[51:58.89]Okay, that was like, what in the name of God?
[52:01.29]I was like, no, they wouldn't be that fucked up, would they?
[52:15.22]How do I get rid of all these, like, race car villains?
[52:19.00]Fireplace?
[52:19.54]There's a fireplace?
[52:20.26]Oh, we gotta burn some of these fucking Nazis.
[52:23.30]Into the fire.
[52:31.23]Go!
[52:31.83]This way!
[52:33.01]No, stop kill-stealing!
[52:34.53]Oh my god.
[52:35.41]Alright, here we go.
[52:36.71]Get up.
[52:37.87]Can I get him?
[52:38.29]Into the fire?
[52:41.65]No, I can't.
[52:42.60]I can't just grab somebody and drag them.
[52:44.36]Alright, now we gotta get out.
[52:45.96]I actually have to... No, we gotta get out.
[52:47.48]Let's go.
[52:47.78]Go, go, go, go, go.
[52:48.16]Out, out, out, out, out.
[53:01.11]This is a Nazi throwing sim.
[53:02.53]What happened to the race?
[53:03.19]I thought we were supposed to be racing cars.
[53:15.60]Bollocks.
[53:18.62]Watch it, you bloody... Fuck me.
[53:21.98]Skyler?
[53:23.72]Are you chatting me up?
[53:26.19]Is this a racing game?
[53:27.77]This is not a racing game.
[53:31.01]This is like an interesting game for me, right?
[53:35.53]If you guys don't know.
[53:36.84]My heritage.
[53:38.02]I'm Irish and Polish.
[53:39.16]My mother.
[53:51.01]My mother's side is Jewish, and my father's side is Catholic.
[53:54.93]So like, I pretty much am the main character.
[53:58.29]Get the fuck out of the way.
[54:02.00]What are you doing?
[54:02.78]Is this a villain?
[54:06.38]They're ready ahead to set up roadblocks.
[54:08.30]Double back and you should be able to slip through the net.
[54:10.34]Yes, that is my actual, like, heritage.
[54:11.70]Oh my god, we're just both driving into walls.
[54:14.80]It's gonna escape!
[54:15.40]He's so close!
[54:37.56]How do I lose these people?
[54:38.82]Escape the Nazis!
[54:39.58]Like, that's easier said than done!
[54:41.28]They're right up my ass!
[54:44.34]Oh my fucking god.
[54:45.50]People, get out of the way.
[54:46.14]Stop having like a picnic or whatever you're doing.
[54:47.66]This is bad.
[54:55.47]Who's in the middle of the car?
[55:00.83]I don't think this is a good escape route, but somehow it's working.
[55:06.77]No, we can't fit in there.
[55:09.25]How do we...?
[55:15.53]How have we not escaped?
[55:25.57]Oh my god, I'm about to get out of the car.
[55:32.35]How do I always get stuck?
[55:33.29]I don't know.
[55:36.72]Come on!
[55:37.80]What is this?
[55:42.22]How did you get back here?
[55:43.04]This is not a... What are you doing?
[55:47.85]What?
[55:49.05]Is he going to punch me?
[55:51.23]Alright, let's go through here.
[55:56.70]Alright, goodbye.
[56:00.16]Turning the car in these small spaces is actually impossible.
[56:09.01]I mean, that lady had to go.
[56:10.79]Let's be real.
[56:12.73]I can't get out of here.
[56:13.69]We're stuck in here forever.
[56:14.55]There's no way I'm getting out.
[56:15.35]There's a car on the way on the other side.
[56:20.21]There's no way to get out.
[56:21.49]This is not going to happen.
[56:22.89]We have to restart the engine.
[56:27.18]Push harder.
[56:27.76]It's not gonna work.
[56:35.01]I need to slow down.
[56:36.19]Oh my god.
[56:37.03]Jesus Christ.
[56:41.01]Imagine being in this car and getting the fuck out of my way.
[56:43.71]Please.
[56:46.81]Is there any other way out of here?
[56:48.35]I have not escaped the Nazis yet, apparently.
[56:50.89]We've not escaped yet.
[56:52.63]That's the only way out.
[56:53.67]We have to go that way.
[56:54.55]So I'm gonna steal this car.
[56:57.85]No, I can't get out of this car.
[56:59.19]This is a scripted event.
[57:00.25]I have to be in the car.
[57:00.99]I can't leave it.
[57:03.11]So we have to just mash through this.
[57:04.77]We have to just push it out.
[57:11.43]There we go.
[57:12.43]That's alright.
[57:15.95]There's a bunch of random people that didn't have to die.
[57:25.68]Okay.
[57:27.23]We've made our way out.
[57:32.54]We are going- Oh my god, I'm a fucking freak.
[57:35.97]Alright, we're good.
[57:38.32]I have to do that.
[57:39.44]I'm sorry.
[57:40.62]You don't know how hard it is to not hit something.
[57:44.62]The car physics are very wonky.
[57:46.05]I can't get up.
[58:05.14]Okay, thank God.
[58:06.02]Jesus.
[58:06.26]Alright, we can keep going.
[58:07.66]Flawless.
[58:25.12]To get some fucking rest.
[58:27.28]Nothing like a brisk evening drive to quicken the blood.
[58:30.53]Except perhaps a single Malt McGarren aged 30 years.
[58:35.71]Must be Christmas.
[58:37.57]Lucky for Jews and me, you can't slide down and shoot me when you're dead.
[58:41.27]Christmas, is it?
[58:42.77]Oh, I'm afraid I've been a bad girl.
[58:45.85]Aye, I'm certain of it.
[58:48.41]What ever happened after that weekend in Monaco?
[58:51.29]You never rang me up.
[58:53.17]You never gave me your number?
[58:54.76]Oh, that's hardly an excuse.
[58:56.60]Don't touch me.
[58:57.16]You're not still pining for Jules' little sister, are you?
[59:00.44]She's a bit of a bore, don't you think?
[59:01.78]This is not a sex scene.
[59:02.98]I don't think I'm out of time.
[59:04.32]It would be rated by the ESR.
[59:05.30]So, you in town for the race?
[59:08.20]What can I say?
[59:09.24]I have a weakness for men in fast cars.
[59:11.76]I've been all over Europe following the circuit.
[59:14.21]Mom and dad are mortified, of course.
[59:16.35]Beat's working for 11.
[59:18.61]I wouldn't know.
[59:20.55]What's this for?
[59:22.25]Shaving your legs?
[59:24.23]A girl should always carry protection.
[59:27.51]Is she going to stab me?
[59:30.81]Oh my god, she is.
[59:33.09]One day you'll have to tell me how you came by these scars.
[59:36.24]You've done enough talking for one night.
[59:38.84]See, my father was a pranker.
[59:43.64]And one day he came up to me and he said, Joker, I want to give you a kiss.
[59:50.46]So how does that scene go?
[60:01.75]Wait, I'm a different character.
[60:03.87]Chaos is a lot.
[60:05.55]To Jack a vehicle.
[60:06.43]Why is it telling me to take Jules to the racetrack?
[60:11.13]So why can't we just take our car?
[60:14.23]Why do I have to take some innocent person's car?
[60:40.31]I thought he was just gonna get run over.
[60:44.51]Alright, let's go to the right track.
[60:53.30]Take the Nazi cars, they're not innocent.
[60:56.28]Uh, you know, you're right.
[60:57.46]You know, you can have your car back, sir.
[60:59.31]I'm very sorry about that.
[61:01.01]Take your car back, that was very mean of me.
[61:03.27]We're gonna steal the car from the Nazis, because they're the fucking bad guys.
[61:13.55]I don't think you can steal these.
[61:22.82]He's got his head run over.
[61:30.14]Okay, he's done.
[61:32.69]How do we get the guy out of his car?
[61:33.93]Is it a flamethrower?
[61:39.03]All that's happening to him is he's getting an itchy back.
[61:45.92]Can we not get in this?
[61:46.92]I don't think we can even get inside of it.
[61:52.18]Well, we can blow this, which would cause a problem, right?
[62:00.46]His face should be melted by now.
[62:08.43]Okay, well.
[62:09.73]That didn't work.
[62:11.75]I think we just have to get out of here.
[62:14.01]Alright, let's go.
[62:16.65]Let's go, yep.
[62:18.52]Don't worry, all cars back in like the 40s, or 30s, whatever, fire.
[62:22.64]It's alright, we're good.
[62:34.07]What is that fucking tank doing?
[62:38.05]What is that tank even doing?
[62:45.64]Does that tank not have, like, shells?
[62:47.14]Oh, boy.
[62:54.17]Come on.
[62:54.45]We're gonna lose him.
[62:56.87]Hit that four-wheel drive.
[62:57.71]Come on.
[62:57.95]Almost gone.
[63:00.79]There it is.
[63:01.91]Oh, fucking ass.
[63:04.28]Get up there.
[63:08.06]Come on.
[63:08.92]It's right there.
[63:09.72]Just... I'm done.
[63:10.70]Do it.
[63:11.22]Done.
[63:11.44]Alright.
[63:11.82]Turn around.
[63:19.20]Here we go again.
[63:21.78]We have complete and total control of our surroundings, don't we?
[63:34.03]I don't think this is four-wheel drive.
[63:39.77]Well, it could be.
[63:40.39]We don't know.
[63:44.44]Is the game actually that loud?
[63:45.92]I've been turning the game up for the cutscene so you can hear it.
[63:49.70]I gotta remember to bring it back down.
[63:53.34]Jesus.
[64:02.03]No, no, no it isn't.
[64:03.35]Really?
[64:03.93]Well, alright.
[64:09.32]There's a lot of people.
[64:10.32]I did the same thing in GTA as well, guys.
[64:14.63]I don't mean to hit any of these people.
[64:22.60]Damn it.
[64:25.68]Come on.
[64:27.12]We're at the race track already.
[64:29.00]Give me a break.
[64:31.74]No.
[64:34.52]Well, we're at the race track.
[64:36.70]Might as well start the race now.
[64:38.56]Shoot the gun.
[64:39.44]Shoot the starter pistol.
[64:40.36]We're racing at the moment.
[64:47.14]I'm currently in the lead.
[64:52.10]How many laps do I have to do here?
[64:56.87]Oh my god.
[65:00.09]Alright, I'm still winning.
[65:02.09]There's one guy, there's one Nazi behind me that I can't seem to escape.
[65:05.42]Mm-hmm.
[65:08.58]Let's try to go off-road a little and just fuck him up.
[65:10.18]Here we go.
[65:10.42]Let's get the fuck up here.
[65:14.55]Wow.
[65:15.21]Why are you such a good driver?
[65:16.21]Alright.
[65:23.13]Here we go.
[65:24.07]Ditch him here.
[65:26.61]He's running into the wall.
[65:27.59]Perfect.
[65:28.13]He's trying to turn around.
[65:28.90]Doing a three-point turn.
[65:31.32]And this is where we get out.
[65:37.62]Right there.
[65:38.10]Gone.
[65:38.60]We win.
[65:38.82]Alright.
[65:40.18]Now he's just stuck there.
[65:41.16]Good.
[65:42.30]I'm going to laugh if he's there during the actual race.
[65:51.89]Take Jules to the racetrack.
[65:58.74]Keep going.
[66:01.50]We're gonna have to do this whole thing again.
[66:11.41]And we're just going for a test drive, that's all.
[66:15.27]I mean, like, pretty good driving skills, if you ask me.
[66:21.47]Like, on a scale of 1 to 10, this is probably a 6.
[66:25.45]Pretty decent, actually.
[66:35.47]Ah, yes.
[66:37.35]Long live the The Hitman.
[66:42.45]Why did this just turn into a Gatorade commercial?
[66:48.28]It's like a NASCAR Gatorade.
[66:52.32]Now we're gonna beat all the Nazis in the race.
[66:56.39]Easy.
[67:00.45]Irish Gatorade.
[67:01.27]Yeah, they're gonna do all kinds of rotten tricks.
[67:17.05]I'll see you at the victory party.
[67:18.65]Here we go.
[67:21.73]I'm going to watch.
[67:25.33]I'm going to be the only guy with a blue car.
[67:28.32]No, there's a guy with a green car.
[67:30.12]Okay, never mind.
[67:30.86]I was wrong.
[67:33.28]So, hey, this is the racing game that you guys were talking about.
[67:36.14]This is... The Saboteur is a racing game.
[67:43.08]This is... Yeah, this is still a flashback.
[67:44.78]Gentlemen!
[67:46.67]So instantly, I'm going to rip the wheel to the left, and I'm going to smash that guy.
[67:52.09]Instantly.
[67:59.61]Where is he?
[68:00.27]What side is he on?
[68:02.00]Is he in the front?
[68:04.72]Is he right next to me?
[68:06.72]No?
[68:06.84]I think he's in the front.
[68:08.20]Look at all these Nazi cars.
[68:10.56]I have to cause like a fucking awful pileup here, don't I?
[68:16.03]God, do I have to win this race?
[68:17.39]Alright, here we go.
[68:18.93]There goes one.
[68:19.77]We're currently in S. No, that's an A. Okay.
[68:22.37]What am I talking about?
[68:23.81]We're currently in S. What are those, letters?
[68:46.65]Come on.
[68:50.69]I was always bad at Mario Kart.
[68:53.57]I was the guy that was in like seventh place the whole time and I never got to first place.
[68:57.42]There's too many turns here.
[69:06.72]How am I gonna get into fucking first place?
[69:08.93]That guy's cheating.
[69:09.67]He's using like a Nazi engine.
[69:13.95]He's, like, cheating with his, like, Nazi car.
[69:16.32]That's bullshit.
[69:16.88]I'll catch up to him right here.
[69:18.76]Alright, good.
[69:20.34]We're in S. Gotta get to T. I'm going so fast.
[69:28.35]How have I not... How have I not caught up by now?
[69:42.80]Is there really seven more fucking people in front of me?
[69:46.36]How?
[69:46.60]What?
[69:49.88]Oh, I'm so far behind.
[69:53.88]What in the name of God?
[69:56.12]I'm just like peeling out.
[69:58.44]There's nobody behind me either.
[70:18.68]I'm going to have to restart this, because I'm so far behind.
[70:23.32]It's kind of like a joke how far behind I am.
[70:29.88]Remember Bowser's Castle in the original Super Mario Kart?
[70:33.62]Like, Super Mario Kart.
[70:35.38]Remember when you would pass, you would lap people?
[70:40.49]Because that course was so easy to just blow by everybody if you hit all the speed powers.
[70:47.11]Okay, I'm going to have to reset this.
[70:51.61]Let's reset it.
[70:53.59]Before we reset it, though, let's cause a huge problem.
[71:03.62]Now get that car's on fire.
[71:07.98]There's nobody in that car.
[71:09.32]There's nobody in this car.
[71:15.56]There's nobody driving that car.
[71:21.59]And it was the only one that was on fire, so that means that a guy bailed out of that car.
[71:26.85]Here we go!
[71:28.25]What?
[71:28.47]It's an invisible wall!
[71:30.43]Oh, that's horseshit.
[71:34.83]There are guys that are invisible fucking bowling alley bumpers.
[71:41.72]No, I can't be number 23.
[71:42.76]That's like a Satan number.
[71:43.64]That's like a terrible number, right?
[71:44.72]I don't want to be 23.
[71:49.08]That's the way, sweetheart.
[71:50.72]Then show them how pretty your backside looks.
[71:53.20]I'm coming for you, joker.
[71:55.10]You're fucking right.
[71:58.70]I have to die.
[71:59.56]Like, I have to... Is there a restart this?
[72:01.74]No, there's not.
[72:03.04]Fuck.
[72:04.06]No, I can't be 23.
[72:06.90]I don't know how to reset the mission.
[72:26.87]If I, like, exit the game, that's gonna, like, fuck me up, isn't it?
[72:36.52]Alright, that's fine.
[72:44.38]This one's 23.
[72:44.70]Maybe I can't move.
[72:45.74]Let's just get back to S.
[72:51.72]See, if we fail this, then okay.
[72:52.92]But like, we're this close.
[72:54.12]Might as well just see what the hell happens here.
[73:13.13]Forever us.
[73:16.45]This is long.
[73:17.29]Yeah, I really don't want to do this again, so I hope this is scripted.
[73:19.71]Watch me have to do this whole fucking thing again.
[73:32.67]That'd be so sad.
[73:35.41]Nice Vista, though.
[73:37.13]Alright, Kurt.
[73:38.27]That guy Kurt won.
[73:39.01]Why does the Jerma nation...
[73:45.26]Alright.
[73:49.56]Oh, God.
[73:51.51]Okay, we have to win.
[73:53.65]Holy shit.
[73:56.55]Oh, no.
[73:57.23]Okay, fuck me.
[73:58.59]We're going to be here all night, guys.
[74:07.72]This time, don't cause any crashes.
[74:09.36]Play this like a professional NASCAR driver.
[74:11.04]That's how I'm going to have to win this.
[74:15.51]Cut in the inside and drip.
[74:18.38]Cut in the inside.
[74:19.16]It's all about the inside.
[74:21.80]No, this is painful.
[74:22.50]I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[74:29.67]Cut the inside.
[74:37.77]Here we go, just like NASCAR.
[74:41.59]Don't do anything stupid.
[74:42.63]Just play it smart.
[74:43.81]I'm not doing this again.
[74:45.19]Cut the inside.
[74:48.67]There it is.
[74:49.57]Cut the inside.
[74:50.03]Watch out.
[74:50.39]These leading Nazis.
[74:51.21]All these guys are the ones we beat up in the bar.
[74:53.85]They have a chip on their shoulder now.
[75:11.78]Is that guy all the way in front?
[75:16.60]What?
[75:16.92]Are you kidding me?
[75:20.23]I even made it to second place.
[75:22.63]He's so far ahead!
[75:23.83]Alright, I'm just gonna trail him the whole time.
[75:30.13]Not gonna cause any problem.
[75:43.97]Be easy.
[75:44.41]Alright, fuck him up.
[75:45.93]Fuck him up.
[75:46.99]Fucked him up.
[75:48.97]Got him.
[75:54.79]Thank God the rest of this is scripted.
[76:05.28]That's when he laughs and then crashes.
[76:07.18]Wait a minute.
[76:10.34]That's not going to...
[76:15.95]Does that mean I lose?
[76:22.65]Thank you, Chunky Baloney, for the 10 bucks.
[76:25.11]Great getaway, 10 out of 10.
[76:26.29]Thank you.
[76:26.93]Also, thank you, Muse, for the bits as well.
[76:29.92]It finds us all soon enough.
[76:31.08]It's time we went home.
[76:47.46]This is still just a... This is just a gigantic flashback.
[76:51.64]I'll see you to the Aurora.
[76:53.62]Wait for me at the pit.
[77:06.41]What's that?
[77:08.14]That is where the silver dart will be on display after tomorrow's ceremony.
[77:11.48]God damn it.
[77:12.30]What ceremony?
[77:13.36]So is the game like GTA?
[77:16.68]Uh, kind of.
[77:17.62]It's more like Mafia than it is GTA.
[77:20.22]It's more like linear than GTA is, but still like open-worldy.
[77:25.46]Cars, pedestrians.
[77:28.09]You mean some kind of freak accident?
[77:30.81]Oh, that would be terrible.
[77:33.09]Aye, tragic.
[77:36.15]Who's up for a little Sunday drive?
[77:39.03]I'm game.
[77:40.68]Where are you two going?
[77:42.70]Vittore told you to wait here.
[77:45.04]We won't be long.
[77:46.46]Jules, don't be a fool.
[77:49.28]If you want to get yourself killed, I can't stop you.
[77:52.05]But leave my family out of it.
[77:53.51]Jules is his own man.
[77:55.47]I know a guy that looks like the main character.
[77:57.03]And we're related.
[77:57.63]Looks like my fucking older cousin.
[78:00.51]When did you become the voice of Prudence?
[78:02.01]Dearka isn't who you think he is.
[78:23.47]He's not a motherless arse-faced knob-jockey.
[78:25.71]He's dangerous, Sean.
[78:27.44]Let it go.
[78:28.12]Thanks for the tip.
[78:30.62]We'll see you girls later.
[78:40.61]Why does this game look so terrible?
[78:42.75]It's actually pretty fun.
[78:43.71]Get in the car.
[78:52.91]Hurry up!
[78:53.53]He's getting away!
[78:56.29]What?
[79:03.67]What?
[79:03.87]We can't just go kick his ass?
[79:05.17]What do you mean the mission failed?
[79:07.96]Let's go kick his ass!
[79:09.52]Let's go kick his ass!
[79:13.50]Don't get too close.
[79:14.66]We don't want to spook him.
[79:15.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[79:17.38]Don't let him out of your sight.
[79:18.88]This isn't the first time I've run a tail, you know.
[79:23.41]How do they pull out the gun?
[79:26.67]Just gotta tail them.
[79:28.97]They're great.
[79:29.75]Remember I made like the Assassin's Creed reference?
[79:33.35]It's just Assassin's Creed.
[79:34.27]Remember Assassin's Creed?
[79:37.21]Where like every single mission you walk slowly behind a guy while he talks for eight minutes?
[79:43.10]Those games were great, weren't they?
[79:57.71]Some of the Assassin's Creed actually weren't that bad.
[80:05.93]Don't let him get too far ahead!
[80:08.70]Idiot!
[80:09.14]Idiot!
[80:09.84]Idiot!
[80:11.10]Idiots!
[80:17.32]Idiots!
[80:25.43]Idiots!
[80:28.97]Looks like he's headed out of town.
[80:30.53]There's only one place he could be going.
[80:32.57]That double-sig motor works.
[80:34.15]That place is going to be crawling with crowds.
[80:37.20]This scheme of ours could get tricky.
[80:39.14]I've no rumors about that place.
[80:41.42]Some people say they're making more than cars out there.
[80:44.53]Double Z. Alright.
[80:45.43]Well, we know how you feel.
[80:46.43]Let's stash the car and take a closer look.
[80:49.25]Let's go.
[80:50.19]Savage is idiots.
[80:50.97]Idiot!
[81:14.55]God.
[81:15.03]God love Dennis Reynolds.
[81:17.91]He almost hit his own guy.
[81:22.03]Think of Zappanus and Zappanus.
[81:23.50]Idiots!
[81:24.06]Idiots!
[81:27.24]If you don't like that show, come on.
[81:28.40]That's literally one of the funniest fucking shows ever.
[81:31.64]Restrict the zone.
[81:32.28]Climb the wall.
[81:46.03]Where the fuck are you going?
[81:47.51]Stay out of sight.
[81:49.21]What?
[81:49.43]Wait, wait, you need to get boosted over the wall?
[81:51.96]How come you can't do that?
[81:53.00]Oh, of course.
[81:53.86]Of course I brought Harry Osborn with me.
[81:57.12]You know what I mean?
[81:58.18]I'm fucking Spider-Man and Harry Osborn comes along, needs a boost.
[82:01.74]Ow!
[82:02.32]And he hurt his leg.
[82:03.08]You alright?
[82:03.96]Yeah.
[82:04.48]Get over here.
[82:06.14]Hmm.
[82:06.30]Oh, don't worry.
[82:07.60]How did you learn to climb like that?
[82:08.80]I'm good.
[82:09.12]Creeping out of bedroom windows at three o'clock in the morning.
[82:12.41]There's no way I'm letting you dead, my sister.
[82:15.07]Nice place.
[82:16.17]There should have a great view of the lake from up here.
[82:19.15]There it is.
[82:20.65]What do you say we take it for a little test drive?
[82:23.08]Right over that cliff.
[82:24.88]You can do the honors.
[82:26.28]I prefer not to watch.
[82:27.42]I have to drive this over the cliff.
[82:29.20]Okay, let's drive it over the cliff.
[82:33.80]Fado, no!
[82:38.89]Fado, no!
[82:46.84]I know, I did it on purpose, I didn't mean to say it.
[82:49.54]I love how he's screaming for me to fail.
[82:53.71]10 bucks says he dies.
[82:54.53]Yeah, you got your $10!
[82:55.31]Fido, no!
[82:56.03]Oh yeah, woohoo!
[83:00.87]There's the joke, there it is.
[83:02.77]Funny, we got it.
[83:08.27]Looks like I need to work on my parallel parking.
[83:11.15]Maybe we should leave our notes, eh?
[83:13.21]Dear Wonker, sorry about the bango.
[83:15.41]Send the bill to me, Ars.
[83:18.82]Oh, give me right harm to see the look on that tosser's face.
[83:22.72]That can be arranged, Herr Devlin.
[83:27.81]Shite.
[83:29.37]Oh, I got knocked out.
[83:30.83]You know, that would kill you, by the way.
[83:33.99]Movies and TV shows got to stop doing that because that like puts forth the notion that you can like bash somebody in the back of the skull with a very blunt object and not instantly kill them.
[83:43.18]That kills you.
[83:44.74]You take a fucking bowling pin to the back of the head hard, you're dead.
[83:47.92]You're not just gonna get knocked out for a minute.
[83:51.72]What the fuck did this game turn into?
[83:53.56]Oh no, this is gonna be something like fucked up Jerma doctor.
[84:01.17]I knew it.
[84:03.99]Oh, he is the fucked up Jerma doctor.
[84:07.41]I'm afraid the pain was more than he could bear.
[84:12.64]I like how he's carrying two pens.
[84:40.87]Like he's a sick fucking Nazi murderous psychopath.
[84:44.68]But gotta have those two pens there to like show that he, you know, he's at least an office ready person.
[84:50.08]God.
[85:03.02]I had a long talk with your friend.
[85:05.27]He sang like a bird.
[85:07.57]But he could not tell me what I most want to know.
[85:11.25]What is that?
[85:15.91]Why is he hiding the gun from me?
[85:17.89]I just saw him take it out.
[85:19.39]I'm gonna hide the gun from you.
[85:20.73]He's hiding it still.
[85:21.57]What?
[85:41.27]You think I'm working for the damn Brits?
[85:43.43]You must be out of your bloody head.
[85:45.18]Enough.
[85:46.46]You will tell me every operational detail of your mission.
[85:50.86]You will tell me.
[85:52.84]One way or another.
[85:55.76]Pull your head out of your arse, man.
[85:58.44]I've got no idea what you're talking about.
[86:01.66]Oh, look, she's holding two guns behind her back, too.
[86:04.98]Oh, he's up.
[86:05.28]Whoa, jeez, he got a gun!
[86:05.94]Whoa.
[86:06.08]I didn't know he had a gun there.
[86:37.18]He's gonna pull the trigger and it's gonna be like a Joker thing with like a funny... What is that like fucking animal noise?
[86:50.32]Wait!
[86:52.12]Did you hear that?
[86:52.56]Like was he about to turn into Beast from X-Men?
[86:54.52]What the fuck was that?
[86:55.22]What is he turning into?
[86:56.27]What the fuck?
[87:12.21]oh man now here comes the random red shirt alright you know he told me to tie you up oh oh I'm so bad at my job I had to come back and tie this guy up I'm a trained nazi specialist
[87:41.30]Before this is over, they're gonna wish it hard.
[87:48.72]I'm important enough to come in this room by myself.
[87:54.03]Think about that.
[87:55.19]Nobody even talks about that.
[87:58.53]This guy was important enough to be in here unsupervised.
[88:04.05]That always has to happen, right?
[88:05.82]Let's take him with us.
[88:08.82]No, we can't pick him up.
[88:09.82]Okay.
[88:10.44]We're trespassing.
[88:12.22]Does he have a gun?
[88:14.52]No.
[88:15.74]Now this is a horror movie.
[88:16.60]Listen to the horror movie music.
[88:17.72]We've tracked into horror movie territory now.
[88:23.70]Escape the factory.
[88:24.72]Can I climb the walls?
[88:31.00]Okay, actually, like, get... Oh, come on.
[88:34.75]I can't, like, Spider-Man on the walls and, like, crawl over there and, like, snap his neck.
[88:41.23]Sneak up behind a Nazi while holding L2 and then press triangle or square to perform a silent, silent, silent kill.
[88:48.43]You know what I was trying to say.
[88:52.01]What's the difference?
[88:52.55]Alright, he's dead.
[88:58.01]God damn it.
[88:58.57]I was trying to put it away.
[89:04.14]Why is R1's shoot gun... What?
[89:11.14]I think I'm aiming the gun at me.
[89:19.08]It's great that this is like a super villain's hideout.
[89:22.24]I'm going to get shot.
[89:24.71]Just a second.
[89:25.51]Okay.
[89:25.61]Got him.
[89:25.91]He's dead.
[89:40.98]Congratulations.
[89:44.55]Let's go.
[89:46.21]Let's keep moving.
[89:51.27]Ten.
[89:51.87]Ten of the ten hitboxes.
[89:53.65]I know, right?
[89:54.20]Let's climb up the sign.
[90:01.98]That was almost very bad.
[90:13.35]The greatest part about this is this is like Shadow of the Colossus controls, but no stamina grip bar.
[90:20.02]This guy is a mutant.
[90:26.72]Can I just grab him over the edge?
[90:28.66]Well, I mean, I have to throw this guy over the edge, right?
[90:37.49]We didn't get to see it, but it's implied what happened, you know.
[90:50.22]That's two broken arms.
[90:53.57]My arms would come out of my sockets like claymation.
[90:55.99]I need a cigarette.
[90:56.81]Yes, me too.
[91:01.11]I don't have any left.
[91:02.59]One guy.
[91:02.91]Now.
[91:03.13]Or you can drink a vodka.
[91:20.71]Who needs to fucking pick up guns when you have the neck snap?
[91:25.62]God damn it!
[91:37.98]I was trying to get behind him and break his neck.
[91:47.75]Perk unlocked, easy.
[91:50.26]Reduce recoil for automatic weapons.
[91:51.82]Cool.
[92:04.66]That's so hard.
[92:08.60]It's so hard to aim.
[92:10.67]It just is.
[92:11.25]Come on, I'm going to be real.
[92:12.69]I'm going to be as real as I can, guys.
[92:14.91]That's very hard to aim because...
[92:18.25]Why don't we just fucking bash people's heads in?
[92:24.33]What did I just take that out of my sock?
[92:28.78]I pulled that gun out of nowhere.
[92:35.26]Easy.
[92:49.21]Come on, what do you got, Nazis?
[92:50.41]Look at that fucking Nazi receptionist.
[92:58.39]Now that Nazi's harder to kill.
[93:03.71]He has like different clothes on.
[93:10.94]I gotta get his fucking head off.
[93:12.66]His hat.
[93:13.16]His fucking hat came off.
[93:20.26]Alright.
[93:21.14]How do I do this?
[93:23.06]How do I get up against this?
[93:25.10]I don't know what the button is.
[93:29.13]Oh my god.
[93:29.99]What's the button?
[93:33.49]How do you get in cover?
[93:34.81]It just said run against a wall?
[93:36.73]That's what I was doing.
[93:41.55]Ah.
[93:43.82]Rescue.
[93:47.60]It's just run against the wall.
[93:49.54]I don't have any left.
[93:52.49]Then get Velka.
[93:55.05]Now!
[93:55.33]Klaus, come back!
[93:58.73]Oh!
[94:02.19]Oh!
[94:27.98]That wasn't fucking worth it.
[94:29.47]I thought they were dead.
[94:30.33]Apparently not.
[94:30.91]They were all getting up behind me and walking down the hall still.
[94:35.57]I thought they were dead.
[94:37.29]No, they're not dead.
[94:38.29]They just get up and fucking come after you again.
[94:40.15]God damn it.
[94:40.93]Alright, no more fucking around.
[94:42.39]Give me the machine gun.
[94:48.86]Let's go.
[94:53.90]No fucking around.
[94:54.92]Watch this.
[95:03.00]We're going through this level quick.
[95:12.69]Dead.
[95:15.57]Dead.

[95:17.03]God damn it, he blew the whistle.
[95:32.25]Other guy.

[95:36.30]Maxed out on grenades.
[95:37.26]Alright, I got grenades.
[95:44.68]One more guy.
[95:51.06]I got tripped.
[95:52.28]I didn't even shoot that guy.
[96:00.35]Where the hell are you?
[96:02.23]What?
[96:02.91]The guy just appeared behind me.
[96:06.98]Oh, no.
[96:07.48]Ain't gonna happen.
[96:08.90]Ain't gonna fucking happen.
[96:09.68]How do I throw a grenade?
[96:19.11]They didn't teach me that at a fucking tutorial school.
[96:21.21]How do I do it?
[96:21.69]... ...
[96:32.36]Alright, let's go.
[96:33.48]Out.
[96:37.85]Steal vehicle.
[96:39.59]You got it.
[96:39.99]Here we go.
[96:50.22]Um, why did it tell me to get in a car?
[96:55.72]Oh, break through the gate.
[96:57.08]Okay.
[96:57.84]Escape Germany.
[97:03.42]Skip Germany in, like, the weird caravan.
[97:08.40]That's thread in the needle if I've ever seen it.
[97:11.24]Easy now.
[97:14.90]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[97:17.42]Don't drive into anything.
[97:18.97]Except for one lady.
[97:20.05]That's okay.
[97:22.61]There's motorcycles in this game, too.
[97:24.15]What a 10 out of 10 game.
[97:25.11]Can't wait to drive one of those.
[97:43.25]I want to get in one.
[97:44.47]Oh, I want to get in one of those motorcycles right now.
[97:56.14]I keep hitting innocent people.
[97:57.50]It's not cool.
[98:04.24]Fucking Nazi traffic.
[98:06.38]Nazi traffic jam.
[98:07.58]And here we go.
[98:08.64]Oh yeah.
[98:09.20]Cutscene.
[98:09.80]That was so lame.
[98:12.58]That was very lame.
[98:29.73]Now the Nazis are shooting each other.
[98:32.05]I think.
[98:33.09]I don't know.
[98:45.23]Can we get back to the present, please?
[98:49.68]I want to go back to, like, running around the city.
[98:54.20]Although I will say that this is just beginning, like, a couple hours.
[98:56.98]It's been pretty fun.
[99:00.25]Made it.
[99:01.51]Three, two, one, done.
[99:02.63]Uh, not done, I guess.
[99:08.45]We just have to keep going.
[99:09.97]Let's drive through the black and white movie.
[99:21.55]I caused a war.
[99:25.38]Yeah, I'm I like me this is what like sparked like a World War II was me like escaping oh No, they've started a war I Stole a Jeep and ran away

[100:57.40]This way?
[100:58.16]Is she in the fire?
[101:00.32]Can I actually walk through the fire?
[101:01.98]I'm not going to get burned, am I?
[101:03.10]I'm going to get burned!
[101:06.86]What's wrong with the fire?
[101:18.36]It's not going to happen, but I want to, you know?
[101:20.06]Oh well.

[101:56.11]Thank God you're unharmed, child.
[101:58.07]No!
[101:58.37]Thank you, Sly161, for the... Oh, I'm going to puke.
[102:02.63]Since you're on the PS3, can we do Uncharted for a stream one day?
[102:09.28]I don't know.
[102:10.00]Are the Uncharted games actually really that fun?
[102:14.17]I don't, like... Uncharted is one of those games that I know is, like, super critically acclaimed.
[102:18.65]Everybody loves them.
[102:20.27]But would it be, like... Would I, like, be able to have fun with those games?
[102:23.71]I don't know.
[102:24.15]I just don't know.
[102:25.05]I know nothing about them.
[102:25.81]I've never played them.
[102:27.67]But, I don't know.
[102:28.27]Maybe.
[102:30.53]Uh, Levin.
[102:31.27]Thank you for the three bucks.
[102:32.47]Just say cheer, cheer, cheer.
[102:33.63]Oh, here comes... Here comes Dad.
[102:37.08]We can't stay here.
[102:38.66]More Germans will come looking for these.
[102:40.80]Cameron, thanks for the bits.
[102:42.44]Aren't tailing missions the best?
[102:46.08]Right.
[102:47.02]And Muse, thanks again.
[102:48.10]We'll get you home.
[102:50.74]Let's go.
[102:51.16]If you like listening to a story and staying quiet.
[102:59.95]What about the newer ones?
[103:01.59]Are the newer ones any good?
[103:03.39]Aren't the newer ones a little bit more action-y and open-world-y where you kind of go on missions and do interesting things?
[103:17.12]Huge fan of your videos, Jeremiah.
[103:18.30]Your videos on how to... Wait, what?
[103:21.40]On how to intimidate women?
[103:23.54]What the fuck are you talking about?
[103:25.01]Alright, I just got sucked into that troll comment.
[103:31.21]Thanks for watching my video.
[103:33.82]We heard on the radio.
[103:35.50]They're fighting at the border.
[103:36.94]We were so worried.
[103:38.62]I see you brought guests.
[103:40.92]These are June's friends.
[103:43.02]They need a place to stay for a while.
[103:46.36]Some place discreet.
[103:49.62]But where is June?
[103:51.64]Is it weird that her teeth are like dark green?
[103:58.07]Something terrible has happened.
[104:01.25]Is that everybody's teeth like that?
[104:02.89]Or does she have, like, the weird, like, dark green teeth?
[104:08.08]No.
[104:09.48]No, this can't be happening.
[104:11.32]No, it's her.
[104:13.20]Your son, he was like a brother to me.
[104:17.64]No.
[104:18.92]No.
[104:19.74]No, my little face.
[104:22.06]No.
[104:22.68]No.
[104:29.70]So now we're 20 years in the future.
[104:33.66]I must know.
[104:35.06]My son, Didi, was it quick?
[104:38.56]Aye.
[104:39.80]Quick and painless.
[104:40.90]That's not true.
[104:41.48]He was tortured for like four hours.
[104:46.44]That is a lie.
[104:47.40]That guy was being tortured by that Nazi sicko.
[104:54.08]I took this from the farm.
[104:56.64]He would want you to have it.
[105:00.33]I remember that picture.
[105:00.99]Now we're going to cut to present day where I'm looking at him.
[105:06.63]Was it quick and painless?
[105:07.99]Yeah!
[105:08.99]Yeah, he just had like a power drill shoved up his ass for like four hours.
[105:12.43]Like, what?
[105:12.85]Like, what the fuck?
[105:14.95]I guess it's like, you know, he would... I would probably say that too.
[105:19.90]Probably wouldn't be like, you know, I would probably just tell him, like, yeah, no, he was... He was quick.
[105:36.49]It was quick after the torture ended.
[105:37.63]That's true.
[105:40.21]Fuck the Nazis, man.
[105:41.33]Like, really.
[105:41.79]Like, what the fuck?
[105:53.52]What happened?
[105:58.00]Fucking Nazis, man.
[105:59.18]I need a break.
[106:08.95]I'm just sleeping okay mini map icon with a pair of letters detonates denotes the location of a character who has a mission for Sean l is for Luke so now the whole world opened up okay that's the end of the game um what's with the red blips on the map though so this is just doors okay it makes things so
[106:35.87]Oh, I forgot.
[106:36.63]Yeah, I forgot about this part.
[106:39.35]Okay.
[106:39.79]Well, here we are.
[106:42.21]Okay.
[106:42.91]Hi, how are you?
[106:45.11]How are you, girls?
[106:46.25]Hi, ladies.
[106:47.24]Okay, let's keep moving here.
[106:49.90]Forgot that I owned the strip club.
[106:51.56]Now I can punch people in the face, right?
[106:53.88]No.
[106:56.42]I can't disrupt my own bar.
[106:58.80]Apparently.
[107:01.85]Oh, this is the DLC.
[107:08.89]Okay.
[107:10.61]I have to get myself a ticket.
[107:15.40]Yeah.
[107:16.22]Too bad the EA servers are offline, guys.
[107:18.00]You're not seeing shit.
[107:19.94]And I wouldn't show it anyways.
[107:20.96]This is a family website.
[107:25.74]I'll go upstairs.
[107:26.42]Okay.
[107:31.25]how do I get upstairs there we are stream it on youtube no I'm not gonna stream it on youtube
[107:48.80]Hello, Luke.
[107:49.18]He's keeping it to himself.
[107:50.70]No, you saw me in the beginning of the stream.
[107:52.42]I tried to put it in.
[107:54.12]It didn't work.
[107:55.17]The EA servers don't work anymore for this game.
[108:12.00]Sean oh please excuse me Mr. godin I did not know you were acquainted we've just met it is an honor to meet you monsieur please we could all agree like that like this is like history you know what I mean I don't think you're here to discuss literature have you heard the nazis is like history
[108:32.96]This is a historical string.
[108:34.30]We're talking about the world history.
[108:37.58]The Nazis are in a fury.
[108:39.94]They've been arresting suspected rebels.
[108:42.28]Sean, they took Vittore.
[108:44.72]Where?
[108:45.24]La Villette.
[108:46.32]The old slaughterhouse.
[108:47.86]The prisoners are going to be shot.
[108:50.04]We must do something.
[108:52.70]Strip clubs are history.
[108:54.54]In for a penny.
[108:55.88]In for a fucking pound.
[108:59.87]Yeah, look at all this history, guys.
[109:02.17]Like, strip club.
[109:04.43]Look, I'm talking about the subject matter.
[109:09.71]I can't even jump in my own club.
[109:12.05]Give me a break.
[109:12.70]I can't even press the jump button.
[109:17.16]Am I going to play Far Cry 5?
[109:19.72]Absolutely.
[109:21.32]Probably the whole thing co-op.
[109:22.96]Might be fun.
[109:23.38]Let's get out of here.
[109:29.08]Jumping is too suspicious.
[109:30.20]Yeah, I know, right?
[109:41.87]Both my heart surgery tutorials and operating table etiquette.
[109:52.57]The suspicion meter is the circle around the mini-map.
[109:54.46]This indicates the suspicion of the Nazis in Sean's area.
[109:58.50]The exclamation point under the mini-map is the visibility indicator.
[110:01.26]If a Nazi can see Sean, this will be on.
[110:05.10]Certain behaviors attract the attention of Nazis and increase their suspicion.
[110:09.04]Suspicious behaviors include carrying a gun openly, planting explosives, climbing, brawling, entering restricted areas, getting too close to Nazis at their installations, and sneaking.
[110:22.63]I mean, I don't even necessarily think that's a Nazi thing.
[110:27.23]I think that I would be suspicious if a guy was holding a gun in his hand, putting a bomb somewhere, punching somebody, entering like a restricted area, or getting really close to me, or sneaking around me.
[110:37.75]This is just like general what's considered not cool.
[110:42.85]That's pretty normal suspicious behavior.
[110:45.77]Planting a fucking bomb on something is pretty fucking normally suspicious.
[110:52.03]When a Nazi sees Sean acting suspicious, the suspicious meter turns yellow and begins to fill.
[110:57.71]If Sean stops the suspicious behavior or gets out of sight, the suspicion meter will turn white and begin to decrease.
[111:07.58]Once the suspicion meter is completely... Didn't we already know this?
[111:13.38]They sound the alarm and... By the way, no witnesses.
[111:17.16]Sean can prevent the Nazis from surrounding me and sounding the alarm by eliminating them from before they can...
[111:23.27]No fucking witnesses.
[111:25.64]If a Nazi is able to sound the alarm, all of the nearby Nazis will open fire and hunt Sean down.
[111:32.54]Killing Nazis while the alarm is going off will raise the alarm level.
[111:35.14]We're getting a lot of this information we already knew.
[111:40.39]Nazis will investigate suspicious noises, including the sounds of explosions and gunshots.
[111:46.71]Suspicious zone appears.
[111:49.95]Don't be in the... Okay, so don't be around a place that you exploded.
[111:53.85]Okay.
[111:58.03]Barb wire on the mini-map.
[111:59.29]Don't go in there.
[112:00.01]If seen inside a restricted area, the Nazis will attempt to sound the alarm immediately.
[112:04.65]Okay.
[112:11.22]Tap circle to stow your weapon.
[112:13.16]Unless Sean is wearing a disguise, walking around Paris with a gun will attract suspicion.
[112:16.42]Okay.
[112:17.90]So...
[112:19.56]What is going... What did I do that was suspicious?
[112:23.88]What happened there?
[112:24.94]Suspicious behavior, apparently.
[112:26.06]We walked out of the fucking club.
[112:28.22]What... What the fuck is this?
[112:30.43]What do you mean escape the Nazis?
[112:31.53]We didn't do anything!
[112:35.11]Get in the car.
[112:36.63]This is teaching us how to escape the Nazis now.
[112:38.95]What the fuck?
[112:46.03]Okay, I thought... I thought that guy got hit by the car.
[112:49.29]Get in.
[112:50.13]Let's go.
[112:50.61]Come on.
[112:51.64]Do not pull me out again.
[112:52.96]No, you don't.
[112:53.80]You fucking dare.
[112:54.86]Oh my god.
[113:00.60]Get in the car.
[113:02.96]Now.
[113:07.28]Yeah, I shot the guy because he started shooting me.
[113:11.49]Now we're in this smoking Winnebago.
[113:15.09]Okay, look at it.
[113:19.47]They said carrying a gun- Oh, I didn't even know I had a gun out!
[113:21.55]I was reading the tutorial text about, like, how to put the gun away.
[113:30.25]Dude, this, like, fucking family vacation mobile is seriously- Like, I can't even- I can't even see the road in front of me.
[113:34.88]I need to get rid of this and get a new car.
[113:39.52]This is unbearable.
[113:43.27]Walk the road, the car.
[113:45.03]Go on a vacation, but take my favorite stool.
[113:47.80]Bring in my stool and two cases.
[114:13.67]lost in Germany the car noises it's not making any noise anymore there we go okay press the gas again that's the spot alright let's go
[114:41.61]Don't let him just meet up with Luke.
[114:43.99]Hey, meet up with Luke.
[114:44.67]He just dove out of your car.
[114:47.85]He dove out of your car because it was dangerous.
[114:49.73]Yep, there's disguises in this game.
[114:51.19]That's why I thought it was like Hitman.
[114:53.59]Maybe you guys are saying this is a game that's not like Hitman.
[114:55.18]It's like, well, where's the Hitman similarities?
[114:57.68]This.
[114:57.86]You, like, take people's clothes.
[115:15.99]require a uniform kill a nazi in hand-to-hand combat with a stealth kill yeah no killing a nazi with bullets or explosives will ruin his uniform making it unusable makes sense well no one's looking hold a triangle to put on the dead nazi's uniform a disguise allows Sean to enter restricted areas and carry a gun without attracting attention nazis will become suspicious if they see Sean climbing sprinting or planting explosives play it cool
[115:40.10]The dotted circle surrounding Shawn on the mini-map.
[115:44.33]Any Nazis within this circle will become suspicious of Shawn.
[115:48.47]Holding left trigger allows Shawn to walk like a Nazi.
[115:53.51]This will reduce the size of the disguise circle, making it easier to move around without raising suspicion.
[116:01.12]Hold on.
[116:02.77]You can... You can walk like a Nazi.
[116:06.27]Okay.
[116:08.01]Sure.
[116:09.67]Whatever you say.
[116:12.81]I wonder what that's going to look like.
[116:19.52]We're going to be stealthy about this.
[116:25.24]Don't fuck up his uniform.
[116:28.84]God damn it.
[116:37.53]Let's get a new uniform Why did he turn around he got to like the end of his path and fucking turned around and you know, it doesn't even matter whatever What It was a see I got to we got wet okay, yeah, yeah, I know the plan you're going to need a change of clothes I
[117:02.76]That's funny.
[117:03.22]I can pretty much tell him to... What?
[117:04.30]Okay.
[117:04.40]Spit it out.
[117:05.30]Let's get this guy before he gets to the end of his walk.
[117:31.31]I mean, can I just drop down behind him?
[117:32.77]I hope so.
[117:37.31]Oh, my fucking god.
[117:38.55]Just, just, just!
[117:44.30]Okay.
[117:46.66]Get his disguise.
[117:48.64]He stepped on his head.
[117:50.22]It's fine.
[117:50.70]We're good.
[117:55.04]By the way, this is, um... This is walking like a Nazi, by the way.
[118:02.38]Walking like a Nazi is just walking normal, just slowly.
[118:07.60]I'm sure you walk like a Nazi.
[118:10.27]Yeah.
[118:11.09]They walked normally just straight like a person.
[118:14.51]It's crazy.
[118:20.23]Why don't I just snap his neck?
[118:21.17]Okay, I want your clothes now.
[118:34.80]Okay, what's in here?
[118:38.68]Nazis will see through Sean's disguise if he stands too close or if he acts suspiciously.
[118:41.92]Hold L2 while disguised to avoid suspicion.
[118:43.70]Okay, well, let's open this.
[118:46.60]Carton of cigarettes, gold coin.
[118:49.74]Okay.
[118:55.03]Okay, so don't get too close.
[118:56.87]Infiltrate the slaughterhouse.
[119:02.55]Dude, I don't want to walk around...
[119:05.47]I just have to walk.
[119:06.41]I have to walk around in these missions.
[119:08.16]That sucks.
[119:18.30]As long as we just keep the circle away from everybody, we're fine.
[119:20.78]Can I climb?
[119:24.74]Is that suspicious?
[119:33.14]It's kind of suspicious, but I think we're okay.
[119:38.42]I'm just a really good climbing Nazi.
[119:46.43]Wow, that guy can climb very well.
[119:51.96]It's taking so long open this damn door get the door open Alright we did Rescued Sean I knew you would come
[120:13.09]They were ready to execute us.
[120:14.87]How did you get yourself into this mess?
[120:17.03]I will explain later.
[120:18.51]This fight is not over yet.
[120:19.67]Nazis don't parkour.
[120:21.37]Sean, look, how bad is it?
[120:24.17]The bullet won't kill me, but those bombers will kill us all if we don't fight together right now.
[120:28.77]Who's this other guy?
[120:29.45]How much time do we have?
[120:30.91]There is no time.
[120:32.33]The attack has already begun.
[120:33.89]Execute.
[120:34.31]Alright, everyone head for the basement.
[120:36.91]Now, move your arses.
[120:39.14]Downstairs, everybody.
[120:41.96]Do I need to- should I pretend to be- am I still a Nazi?
[120:44.94]Alright, I'm gonna pretend to still be a Nazi, right?
[120:49.85]We don't have much time, okay.
[120:50.99]Alright, we gotta go.
[120:51.71]Alright, well- oh, Jesus Christ.
[120:54.43]The time remaining just, like, got- you know in Super Mario, when you have, like, 22 seconds left and it plays the Super Mario music, then you have to go real fast?
[121:02.77]That just happened.
[121:03.89]Jesus.
[121:06.96]That, like... And you're like, fuck, man, I gotta go quick, the fucking fast music is playing.
[121:23.16]The bar was dropping very slowly before.
[121:29.74]Inspiration.
[121:34.08]Sean's courageous actions have inspired the people of this neighborhood to fight back against the Nazis.
[121:38.90]This change of heart is indicated by the restoration of a color to the area.
[121:42.52]The resistance is stronger and more active in areas where color has been restored.
[121:46.39]Okay.
[121:47.41]Well, that makes sense.
[121:48.01]So now I can see.
[121:54.96]This is the resistance headquarters.
[121:56.50]We'll be getting the tutorial right now.
[122:03.62]Honestly?
[122:04.98]We're getting... This is like the very beginning of the... How long is this game?
[122:09.52]Damn, this is like a big fucking game.
[122:11.86]Where did you get to the bottom line?
[122:13.67]I'll go have a chat with him.
[122:15.03]I don't know what happened.
[122:15.81]I just got angry.
[122:18.57]Okay, that was strange.
[122:20.33]Whatever, fine.
[122:21.21]Okay, bye.
[122:25.51]Did they think of a Nazi?
[122:26.51]You're the one called Santos.
[122:28.15]Who's asking?
[122:29.21]The one that stopped these crowds from decorating that wall with your brains.
[122:32.63]Did you get to the bottom line?
[122:36.53]What can I do for you?
[122:37.63]Where did you get to the bottom line?
[122:40.87]The heavy stuff.
[122:42.01]I see.
[122:43.09]The Nazis stole the colors.
[122:44.95]But it won't come true.
[122:46.49]The black market is a barter system.
[122:48.45]You'll need something to trade for the medicine.
[122:50.59]Like what?
[122:51.25]Contraband.
[122:52.07]What else?
[122:53.05]I sold a rare bottle of champagne to a Jerma officer this morning.
[122:56.49]Bring the bottle back to me.
[122:58.45]It's worth a small fortune.
[123:00.85]To the right people.
[123:05.14]Okay, find the bottle.
[123:10.90]We're going on a fetch mission, everybody.
[123:16.72]I skipped.
[123:17.86]I guess I pressed circle or something.
[123:19.46]I don't know how.
[123:19.84]Alright, find the bottle.
[123:25.27]Let's get out of our, like, weird... Okay, by the way, the mini-map is like a coloring book.
[123:30.95]I don't like it.
[123:31.73]I don't like the coloring book mini-map.
[123:40.86]That was some pretty cool shit right there.
[123:48.89]You can climb up the side of a building, but you can't climb a fence.
[123:54.44]You can Spider-Man up a fucking 200 foot tall building.
[124:02.56]Is there... Am I going to ruin the... The uniform is going to get wet, right?
[124:05.25]And it's going to be like a throwaway uniform.
[124:06.97]No, I'm going to keep it.
[124:08.23]This way.
[124:12.55]There we go.
[124:18.76]Oh, wait a minute.
[124:19.46]Okay, we're good.
[124:27.78]Just walk around.
[124:31.39]Walk like a Nazi.
[124:33.27]Everything's fine.
[124:35.59]Just keep an eye on the mini-map.
[124:36.61]Make sure you don't run into anything suspicious.
[124:45.38]Steal a car?
[124:48.68]Oh, easy.
[124:49.40]Nazi.
[124:52.18]I can run normally here.
[124:53.08]Gotta be careful of this guy.
[124:58.57]Why does sprinting make it... Jeez, come on.
[125:00.71]I can go in the restricted area, though.
[125:05.11]Oh, goddammit.
[125:06.13]Come on, please.
[125:08.91]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[125:12.75]It's right there.
[125:14.41]Just walk to it.
[125:14.99]Don't do this dumb thing again.
[125:16.37]That guy was in a rush.
[125:25.28]Okay, here we go.
[125:27.76]Yawn?
[125:29.65]That was a yawn.
[125:30.43]I'm sorry.
[125:30.95]I had to steal this bottle.
[125:42.33]Uh... Wait, wait, wait.
[125:43.07]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[125:54.33]What the fuck, man?
[125:55.65]How are they supposed to know that?
[125:58.01]Just get the bottle.
[125:58.97]Just go get the bottle of champagne.
[126:04.18]Get out of my fucking way.
[126:11.52]My disguise popped off.
[126:14.28]Oh, watch out.
[126:15.18]They know that you're not a Nazi.
[126:19.06]They just all started shooting at the same time.
[126:23.02]I thought I could, I thought I could walk in.
[126:25.43]I have a disguise.
[126:27.13]So, I have to go this way then.
[126:36.81]Climb up the side of the building like fucking Spider-Man.
[126:45.03]I'll show you, I'll show you some real Nazi work here, guys.
[126:55.81]Steal the champagne.
[126:56.84]You got it.
[126:57.24]Yeah.
[127:05.66]Alright.
[127:07.34]Where's the bottle of champagne?
[127:08.56]It's over there.
[127:11.97]This really is Assassin's Creed.
[127:18.39]I'm just playing Assassin's Creed now.
[127:25.75]Where is it?
[127:26.29]Right down there?
[127:29.31]Here it is.
[127:29.63]Assassin's Creed.
[127:42.02]Assassin's Creed.
[127:43.22]Nazi.
[127:44.84]Coming soon to Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
[127:55.11]How do I get it?
[127:58.88]How do I take the bottle?
[128:02.86]How do you steal the champagne?
[128:10.87]I'd love to steal that champagne.
[128:21.21]Real stealthy.
[128:22.07]Where's the champagne?
[128:28.94]Um, where's the champagne?
[128:32.44]It's the big bottle.
[128:33.88]It's the big cartoon bottle right there.
[128:35.73]Why can't I take it?
[128:38.79]Shoot the bottle?
[128:41.51]It doesn't do anything.
[128:56.32]You were at this Nazi party.
[129:00.29]Guilty.
[129:01.79]Guilty.
[129:12.33]All of you, guilty.
[129:14.85]Got it.
[129:17.01]I need to shake these crowds before I head back to Santos.
[129:28.02]Look at that.
[129:35.99]Get to the hiding spot.
[129:37.59]What's the hiding spot?
[129:38.41]Is it inside of here?
[129:41.77]Get inside the dungeon?
[129:42.79]Where is this?
[129:43.81]Where am I going?
[129:44.47]Here.
[129:45.67]Waiting this shit out?
[129:51.40]Cool.
[129:53.12]I did it.
[129:55.04]Return the champagne.
[130:14.37]Did I get it?
[130:15.63]I got it, right?
[130:16.39]I think I got it.
[130:21.88]What is this long cutscene?
[130:26.04]What was that for?
[130:27.64]Does anybody know what that was for?
[130:28.96]I don't know what that was for.
[130:31.52]Turn the champagne.
[130:33.06]You got it, man.
[130:36.25]We got it.
[130:45.35]Don't have a costume on anymore.
[130:48.92]We win the mission.
[130:49.86]We win.
[130:50.26]Okay, we're good.
[130:57.83]What was the purpose of the big, long zoom-out pan of that building?
[131:03.79]I don't know.
[131:04.73]Easy here.
[131:05.69]Easy here.
[131:14.36]Oh, come on, really?
[131:16.52]You can't be like a bear and climb this shit?
[131:21.03]At least you can swim in this fucking game.
[131:26.40]Is there a reliable way to get up?
[131:30.36]I'm gonna say this way.
[131:32.32]Use the bridge?
[131:32.94]No, I mean, if I can go for a parkour, why wouldn't I try it?
[131:44.74]He's straight up the movies.
[131:47.37]Look, everybody was gonna talk shit.
[131:50.89]And here we are.
[131:51.93]Faster than it would have been normally.
[131:53.69]Okay, we're good.
[131:55.21]Take a look at this.
[131:56.55]Take a look at that.
[131:57.33]Parkour a little bit.
[131:59.47]Bump into a Nazi.
[132:00.45]Give it a little bit of a wee-woo.
[132:02.19]Hey!
[132:02.97]Sorry, buddy!
[132:07.13]Nazi walk.
[132:08.55]Nope, that's sneaking.
[132:09.37]Okay, never mind.
[132:09.83]Yeah.
[132:14.33]I gotta get a car.
[132:15.39]This is a fast car.
[132:18.90]Ow.
[132:20.28]Ow.
[132:21.56]Lady.
[132:22.48]Excuse me.
[132:24.34]I need this car.
[132:25.36]Crash!
[132:25.96]Alright.
[132:50.00]Hello.
[132:51.50]Here's your champagne bottle.
[132:52.58]I'll take a mission complete.
[132:57.04]Don't get in the car.
[133:00.14]Give him the bottle.
[133:00.87]Give him the bottle, please.
[133:03.67]Ah, muy bien.
[133:09.66]When am I gonna play Demon's Souls?
[133:10.70]Uh, soon.
[133:11.04]That is also on the... What was that?
[133:12.56]Uh, I wanna play Demon's Souls.
[133:13.49]Yes.
[133:13.57]Car drive two feet.
[133:27.88]I wasn't kidding, guys.
[133:29.14]I have like 30 fucking PS3 games.
[133:30.62]Demon's Souls is one of them.
[133:31.88]Let's wait for him to drive into us.
[133:33.18]Take the meds to Luke.
[133:34.32]Okay.
[133:34.42]Sure thing.
[133:34.70]I was going to grab him, but that would be such a mistake.
[134:00.06]Am I gonna beat Demon's Souls on stream?
[134:02.28]It depends on how excruciatingly difficult it is.
[134:08.95]How do I get in here?
[134:25.68]What if I, like, fucking do the double bars in the Olympics?
[134:28.68]What the hell was that?
[134:31.91]Gonna keep going down.
[134:47.86]Did I ever play Undertale?
[134:48.96]I actually streamed all of Undertale.
[134:51.96]From beginning to end.
[134:54.98]I brought the medicine.
[134:56.22]Oh, good.
[134:57.78]The wound has become infected.
[135:01.68]I will stay till he's back on his feet.
[135:03.64]You can't stay here.
[135:05.22]Come on.
[135:05.74]I'll take you back to the bell.
[135:07.20]No.
[135:08.36]You will not.
[135:09.20]Veronique, I'm just looking out for you.
[135:11.26]That's all.
[135:11.96]The way you looked after Jules.
[135:13.58]Would you guys say that Demon's Souls... Where is Demon's Souls on the difficulty screen?
[135:17.76]Difficulty screen?
[135:21.02]So if you were to rate how difficult Demon's Souls is compared to Bloodborne, what would you say?
[135:27.50]If Bloodborne is like an 8 for difficulty, where is Demon's Souls?
[135:36.92]10.
[135:39.32]Bloodborne is harder.
[135:40.22]10.
[135:43.00]Demon's Souls is like 6.
[135:44.98]Easiest souls other than 2.
[135:48.98]Demon's Souls is harder.
[135:50.66]It's weird to ask that question because I feel like a lot of people have a bunch of different opinions on it.
[135:58.25]Let me put it this way.
[135:59.85]Is Demon's Souls easier or harder than Dark Souls 1?
[136:03.71]What would you say?
[136:10.40]Because I loved Dark Souls 3, I loved Bloodborne.
[136:14.34]I beat all of Dark Souls 2 in, like, Scholar of the First Sin.
[136:18.56]And it was, it was okay.
[136:19.76]And, like, Dark Souls 1 was, like, a little too much for me.
[136:24.73]I got, like, half, I got, like, maybe, like, a third of the way through Dark Souls 1 after Blighttown.
[136:29.19]When I knew I had to go back through Blighttown, I was like, I don't want to play this video game ever again.
[136:34.71]So, like, knowing my, like, my soul's experience.
[136:39.73]What would you say?
[136:48.63]If you like shields and demons, it's easier.
[136:50.63]Blighttown, LOL.
[136:51.97]You don't have to go back through Blighttown.
[136:57.26]There's a shortcut back to Firelink you missed.
[136:59.06]Well, you know, it's a hard game.
[137:00.72]Come on.
[137:01.00]Just give me this.
[137:08.77]You know what I noticed about the Saboteur?
[137:12.11]Everybody walks in the street.
[137:16.13]Even in, like, GTA and, like, Mafia, any, like, open world with pedestrians, nobody walks in the fucking street.
[137:23.04]People mind their business on the sidewalk.
[137:24.86]They're not walking around on the street.
[137:28.92]I can't steal the tank.
[137:29.72]I already tried it.
[137:33.00]If Blighttown made me quit, I will not like Demon Slayer.
[137:38.32]I was under the impression that Blighttown was, like, one of the worst parts of Dark Souls 1.
[137:41.53]So you're telling me that, like...
[137:43.27]You tell me that one of the worst places in Dark Souls 1 is the whole game for Demon's Souls.
[137:48.29]Is that what you're saying?
[137:52.07]Well, I planted.
[137:53.09]Where's the mission?
[138:13.44]Not even close.
[138:17.16]The Valley of Defilement.
[138:19.28]No weapons inside, handsome.
[138:21.54]You can leave them with me.
[138:22.94]Anything for you, Sean.
[138:24.18]Let's get another mission.
[138:25.08]I hope to be at home sheltered from this storm.
[138:27.44]It seems fate had other plans.
[138:29.74]How did you get picked up?
[138:31.03]I was recognized by an informant.
[138:32.37]Demon's Souls is just a bad thing.
[138:34.03]Any idea on who the rat might be?
[138:36.09]I don't have a name.
[138:37.57]But I know he is planning to meet with a Nazi officer outside the bar.
[138:40.15]Is it worth playing?
[138:40.81]I'll follow this crowd.
[138:42.29]I love Dark Souls 3 and I love Bloodborne.
[138:45.75]Am I gonna hate Demon's Souls?
[138:48.05]It's just Alpha Souls.
[138:49.07]Well, I can't promise I'm gonna finish the game, but I do want to try it because I've never tried it before.
[138:52.87]Demon's Souls is worse than Dark Souls 1.
[138:54.35]It's wonderful, it's just old.
[138:55.49]Okay.
[139:13.86]That's what I'm talking about.
[139:15.00]I didn't have a chance to play Demon's Souls.
[139:17.56]I had an Xbox 360.
[139:20.56]And then I got into PC gaming, mostly.
[139:23.55]So Demon's Souls was just something I never got a chance to play.
[139:27.31]By the way, I'm like... Not gonna kill you, but like... That was fucking rude.
[139:51.11]Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne are probably the most separate from the other games.
[139:53.49]The combat is more reaction-rolling based and faster, generally.
[139:59.87]Interesting.
[140:04.46]Find General Cleave.
[140:09.68]I'm assuming he's in here, because the blip is in here, so we're gonna go in here.
[140:16.72]I don't even know why I'm taking a car in here.
[140:28.27]Am I that lazy that I don't want to, like, run up this?
[140:32.70]Apparently I am.
[140:35.88]I can get up there.
[140:38.10]This fucked up somebody's, like, fruit stand, but whatever.
[140:40.16]That guy's really upset about it.
[140:47.30]No, just get up.
[140:53.38]Whoa!
[140:53.52]Whoa!
[140:53.74]Whoa!
[140:53.98]Put that away.
[140:55.42]Put that away.
[140:56.61]What the fuck?
[140:57.17]This really is just Assassin's Creed.
[140:59.43]I don't want to play Assassin's Creed.
[141:18.81]Clearly see me I don't want to do this again.
[141:32.84]We just did one of these No, well
[141:46.91]I hate trailing missions with a passion.
[141:55.18]What?
[141:55.38]Oh, he's just standing there.
[141:57.80]Where am I supposed to go in this situation?
[141:59.62]Just run to the pasture?
[142:01.76]Apparently.
[142:06.22]Sly Cooper.
[142:14.32]If I hate the Swamp of Poison toxic in Souls games, I'm gonna hate the Valley of Defilement.
[142:20.64]Well, here's the thing.
[142:21.69]I was told... This is why I like Souls games.
[142:23.81]They're so strange.
[142:25.75]When I was going through Dark Souls 2, Boo and Star and, like, Etalyx, everybody told me that the Shrine of Amana was going to be the worst thing I would ever experience in a video game.
[142:40.46]I remember Boo just being like, you're gonna hate it.
[142:42.84]It's awful.
[142:43.64]It's the worst thing I've ever done in a video game.
[142:46.15]And I beat it first try.
[142:48.35]It was not even an issue at all.
[142:49.93]It was not an issue at all.
[142:54.33]Literally, I beat the whole thing in one go.
[142:57.05]It was easy for me.
[143:00.16]So, what is considered excruciating for some people is like... What wasn't that big of a deal for me, apparently.
[143:12.56]What?
[143:15.18]Kill the traitor.
[143:17.72]Kill this guy.
[143:18.60]How do I kill this guy without alerting the general?
[143:20.30]He's doing broad daylight?
[143:25.17]I did it.
[143:27.05]I win.
[143:27.21]I killed the traitor.
[143:27.71]There we go.
[143:28.05]It was that easy.
[143:40.76]Liar!
[143:41.34]No, actually, that can be corroborated with Boo.
[143:43.78]Because Boo... I think Boo watched me do it.
[143:46.44]I, like, streamed it to him on Steam.
[143:50.16]So, that did happen.
[143:54.24]It actually happened.
[143:54.94]It was a thing that happened.
[143:59.73]I used to stream, like, Steam games to Boo.
[144:06.51]I killed him by punching... Well, I killed him by punching him in the temple, like, five times.
[144:14.44]What is this?
[144:15.94]Oh, fuck.
[144:16.40]It's Shandok Lagane.
[144:18.52]Connect over all your bread.
[144:19.96]Now it's fucking ruined.
[144:20.74]Stream on Steam again.
[144:21.66]Yeah?
[144:33.19]Like what?
[144:34.21]Anything you need.
[144:35.83]Maybe I wouldn't beat the whole thing, but I at least want to try Demon Soul.
[144:42.43]Discreetly, and at a very reasonable price.
[144:46.50]Right.
[144:47.14]I don't suppose you'd take a personal check?
[144:50.50]I'm afraid not.
[144:51.94]Then how do you expect me to pay for these wares of yours?
[144:55.16]Why, contraband, of course.
[144:57.02]Jerma military supplies are best.
[144:59.36]There are Nazi installations all over the city.
[145:01.95]You will need heavy firepower to destroy them.
[145:04.61]Explosives, perhaps.
[145:06.37]My dealers offer you credit for any equipment you can salvage.
[145:09.93]Jerma officers are another source of contraband.
[145:12.88]Of course, you'll have to kill them first.
[145:15.76]You can trade the contraband to my dealers for weapons and ammunition.
[145:19.54]Even vehicles.
[145:20.90]I have people stationed all over the city 24 hours a day.
[145:23.78]This game's really cool.
[145:24.93]Let me guess.
[145:25.93]Only to pay a fee to join this little club of yours.
[145:29.23]Well, yes, just a small donation to cover my expenses.
[145:34.31]Consider it holy shit future.
[145:36.85]Okay, my friend Pierre here will provide you Chubby to get you started free of charge chubbies chubby Street thread Chubby's thread chubby three thread just give $100 No message just Kappa 10,000 Jesus Christ Chubby est thread

[146:23.11]That's a fucking dickload of money.
[146:27.14]And... There's no message.
[146:29.48]All I can say is that's... Fucking... Thank you for $100.

[146:36.37]We gotta get a $100 joke in here.
[146:38.83]I don't know.
[146:39.21]I gotta think of a fucking $100 joke.
[146:41.95]I don't have the tit DLC.
[146:43.63]Somebody's wrote in all capitals.
[146:44.99]No.
[146:45.57]And just because you wrote in all capitals doesn't mean I don't have it.
[146:49.21]EA turned off their service for this game so we can't get our pornography to stream on this website and then get me permanently banned.
[146:57.96]But thank you so much again, chubbiest thread.
[147:01.70]For the 100 bucks.
[147:03.23]That is a lot of cash to throw down in one second.
[147:08.93]Who writes in all capitals?
[147:10.01]I do.
[147:13.05]Buy the DLC for the joke now.
[147:14.51]I can't.
[147:15.37]I can't buy it.
[147:19.35]Items highlighted in the equipment.
[147:20.51]Okay.
[147:21.26]Contraband can be traded on the black market for weapons, ammo, and upgrades over time.
[147:24.72]New weapons and upgrades will become available in the black market.
[147:26.80]Okay.
[147:29.13]Grenade and dynamite.
[147:30.05]They're both free.
[147:32.75]It's free.
[147:33.43]So why would I not take it if it's free?
[147:38.45]You talk about all this black market shit and all of it was free.
[147:43.81]How do I use it?
[147:48.38]How do you use the dynamite?
[147:54.20]Oh, it's... Okay, you plant it.
[147:58.02]What about grenades?
[147:59.38]Didn't I get grenades, too?
[148:00.32]Alright, sabotage the tower.
[148:08.28]Easy enough.
[148:11.68]Buy the alligator.
[148:16.07]Uh, how do I get over there?
[148:18.93]I'm just gonna climb the building.
[148:21.77]Why would I do anything else besides... I'm just gonna climb it.
[148:28.48]We could change to a new game if you guys want.
[148:34.06]I got a lot of fucking PS3 games that are just fucking absurd, so we can go through them.
[148:42.05]I'm visibly armed.
[148:44.53]Oh, fuck me.
[148:45.51]Okay, well, that's how you throw a fucking grenade.
[148:55.82]Get off the ladder.
[148:58.39]Where's the tower?
[148:59.13]I have to blow up this tower.
[149:04.59]Okay, light it up.
[149:14.52]Can I get up there fast enough?
[149:23.94]Took it out.
[149:24.82]We got the short fuse perk.
[149:26.54]And that's how you take down a tower.
[149:28.40]We're good.
[149:31.04]Kill the Nazi general.
[149:33.13]Where's this Nazi general you're talking about?
[149:37.39]Was he that guy?
[149:38.47]I don't know.
[149:38.87]There's a Nazi general down here.
[149:41.66]This guy.
[149:42.18]Okay.
[149:42.54]Can I like throw a grenade at him?
[149:49.23]Okay, I win.
[149:50.93]Destroy the armored car.
[149:52.23]Okay, there's another thing to do.
[149:54.65]From the shadows as fucking Irish Batman.
[150:06.30]Come on.
[150:08.60]It's so close to being destroyed.
[150:12.20]No, I can't even throw any more grenades.
[150:23.29]Light the fuse.
[150:24.01]They're too scared.
[150:24.41]They're gonna be scared.
[150:25.15]See?
[150:25.35]I told you they're gonna be fucking terrified.
[150:31.85]Three.
[150:32.77]Two.
[150:33.67]One.
[150:34.10]Boom.
[150:36.46]Now escape.
[150:37.06]You got it.
[150:38.56]I'm gonna plant one right here.
[150:41.46]Right there.
[150:43.02]Watch this.
[150:43.28]Now everyone's gonna be fucking running away from this.
[150:44.96]That's like essentially like a landmine.
[150:46.63]Wait a minute.
[150:46.91]Can I pick it up?
[150:49.88]Okay.
[150:51.41]Why would I put that in my pocket?
[150:52.79]That doesn't seem like a smart idea.
[150:54.87]Do I still have it in my pocket?
[150:58.11]There's a hiding spot right here.
[151:08.64]Hide in here.
[151:15.04]What just happened?
[151:16.34]Climb.
[151:16.86]Quick.
[151:17.33]Get up.
[151:17.55]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[151:18.23]Come on, Spider-Man.
[151:18.91]Go.
[151:20.25]Get up there!
[151:21.39]They're gonna be trying to shoot you, but you can make it.
[151:28.06]He stole the car from the Nazis.
[151:29.84]Well, what do you want me to do?
[151:35.94]And this is our hiding spot right here.
[151:39.33]Right there?
[151:41.13]Where is it?
[151:41.53]Right here?
[151:41.81]Alright, hide inside this weird shack.
[151:50.88]Alright, what have we got back here?
[151:51.84]What have we got back here?
[151:53.18]We'll do one more.
[151:53.76]We'll do one more game.
[151:55.52]This one's going to be like a quick one, though.
[151:57.64]I'll take a pee break.
[151:58.36]I'll come back and play one more game.
[152:02.95]Escape from level 2 alarm five times.
[152:05.29]Getaway strike.
[152:07.95]I kind of want to know what the hell any of this even means.
[152:10.41]Perks?
[152:14.25]The perk screen shows you what perks you have unlocked and lets you see your progress under the perks.
[152:19.36]Okay, okay, ok ok ok k k k k kay kay kay kay.
[152:24.36]Press and hold large haymaker. Okay.
[152:28.00]Hardware.
[152:31.00]Evasion. Mayhem.
[152:39.00]When you have a opponent grappled hold the-
[152:40.00]Crowd clear attack.
[152:43.00]I gotta try that.
[152:52.75]We're cool?
[152:56.16]I want to try this clear crowd attack.
[153:03.40]How is that a crowd clearing attack?
[153:10.10]I just like spin him by his neck.
[153:13.30]I picked up grenades.
[153:14.20]Nice.
[153:14.52]Okay.
[153:15.17]Well.
[153:16.61]Whoops.
[153:21.53]Where is it?
[153:24.09]Where's the grenade?
[153:24.77]Didn't that just throw a grenade?
[153:32.60]Alright, crowd clear.
[153:36.68]That was not a crowd clearing attack.
[153:38.72]Neither was that.
[153:40.74]Neither was that.
[153:41.50]Okay, we're dead.
[153:42.38]Alright, let's see here.
[153:49.04]What do you guys think we can do?
[153:51.08]I kind of want to put this in because it sucks.
[153:55.58]I actually am having fun with this game, but... I mean, we got like about two or three hours into this one.
[154:03.14]We've seen a lot of funny things.
[154:04.35]We've seen a lot of fun things.
[154:05.33]I actually might come back to this, but they do have a lot of PlayStation 3 games to go through.
[154:09.61]I just fucking smashed that guy for no reason.
[154:16.70]This is just cruel.
[154:18.74]What am I doing?
[154:19.26]Why am I doing this?
[154:26.60]Pole time?
[154:28.28]Maybe.
[154:29.04]Why were these Nazis just sleeping on the ground?
[154:31.73]I fucking love that so much.
[154:33.89]LSD Dream Simulator?
[154:35.73]No.
[154:35.93]Let's see what else they got.
[154:54.90]Let me take a break.
[154:55.42]I'll be right back.
[154:55.99]I'm going to play one more game.
[154:58.83]I'm going to take a piss, get one more drink, and we'll keep going.
[155:02.55]I'll be right back.
