[14:00.12]I was almost there.
[14:00.92]That's alright.
[14:01.58]Defeb's over here.
[14:03.80]Rigatoni got in here.
[14:05.52]Lost a man.
[14:06.15]Wow.
[14:09.42]Wait, what happened?
[14:11.12]Well, it's friends only, so I guess... Back of the plane, guys.
[14:14.09]Back of the plane.
[14:17.81]Look at the points I have right now.
[14:21.59]Fucking hammered.
[14:25.53]Open, open, open, open.
[14:28.28]Oh, that's it.
[14:30.29]Yeah, GG humans.
[14:32.93]That's it, you guys.
[14:34.53]Our team can't win.
[14:37.87]MLC_St3alth, 2271.
[14:38.69]Oh my god.
[14:41.91]He must have been the tank.
[14:43.93]Yeah.
[14:44.73]No, I think we're good.
[14:48.00]23 points.
[14:51.06]Well, guys, we didn't get every single level, but we got it where it counts.
[14:55.32]Yeah.
[14:56.74]The finale.
[14:58.16]We still need it.
[15:00.36]Too bad we went first, so now they know our strategy.
[15:04.10]I don't think we can even win.
[15:05.88]Yeah, we're probably not going to make it out of the spawn.
[15:09.16]The spawn door.
[15:11.16]Even if we all finished, I don't think we get enough points.
[15:16.36]That badger.
[15:18.52]I really can't believe Russian Badger literally all tabbed during the game and wasn't even playing.
[15:24.26]Music videos take priority.
[15:26.06]Is there just a pub on your team now?
[15:29.04]Yeah, Rigatoni's the pub.
[15:32.82]He probably crashed while alt-tabbing.
[15:35.08]Hey guys, we should just, like, go right now before they set up.
[15:37.55]Oh, they're already set up.
[15:39.69]It takes four seconds to, like... Oh, see, they're not set up.
[15:42.81]How am I not on top of him?
[15:48.43]Is there a Skype call?
[15:52.59]Up in here?
[15:53.83]No, there's no Skype call.
[15:55.69]No, we would never talk on Skype.
[15:58.95]That would be ridiculous.
[16:00.94]What's this Skype you guys are talking about?
[16:02.96]I don't know what that is.
[16:04.40]I think they're talking about Yahoo Messenger where you can use the voice feature.
[16:09.72]It's a good program.
[16:11.12]Well, we got rid of Rigatoni for you guys.
[16:13.36]Thank you.
[16:14.04]Oh, that's YouTube talk.
[16:15.60]YouTube talk is the way to go.
[16:17.10]Yeah, we each make a video responding to what the last person said.
[16:20.65]Yeah.
[16:20.97]Upload it.
[16:21.79]In a video response.
[16:23.49]Oh, my God.
[16:24.05]That would be so terrible.
[16:25.21]That would be so awful.
[16:30.70]Get you mad subs, though.
[16:34.06]Ouch.
[16:34.90]Yeah, give me that sexy time.
[16:37.64]Can't allow it.
[16:39.08]Can we get somebody pinned over there?
[16:42.59]My ass.
[16:44.53]We got any hunters or anything that are around?
[16:47.15]I'm pretty sure you guys can't score a thousand points, so it's pretty much UGA.
[16:52.31]Can't underestimate the power of us.
[16:55.64]Kia's going fucking ham on that bouncing right now.
[17:03.32]Why can't we just open the back of the plane right now?
[17:10.12]Oh, God.
[17:10.86]Hop in.
[17:12.99]Yeah, like, why can't you just pry that thing open?
[17:15.15]Yeah.
[17:17.05]How do you get it?
[17:17.67]I'm reloading.
[17:23.13]That has been kill all.
[17:26.11]What am I doing?
[17:27.11]I just, like... Oh, crap.
[17:30.11]I'm trying to press the freaking, like, button.
[17:33.84]As a boomer, I just walked up to claw you.
[17:36.14]I wasn't even trying to boom you.
[17:37.14]I was like, yeah, I'll just punch you.
[17:38.38]Like, my brain was in a different time zone.
[17:40.87]Is there anything to throw?
[17:48.55]Dude, I have eight points right now.
[17:50.93]Oh, Rigatoni had zero, so it's alright.
[17:53.29]Or not Rigatoni.
[17:54.56]Russian Badger.
[17:59.46]Let's go this way, Stealth.
[18:03.96]Uh, okay.
[18:06.66]I guess I fairly deny.
[18:07.78]The beta of YouTube Talk?
[18:12.18]Oh, get him, get him.
[18:13.02]Pin him.
[18:13.72]Yeah, he's down.
[18:15.48]Wow.
[18:16.28]This could be the end.
[18:19.02]No, pipe bomb.
[18:20.44]Activate.
[18:21.62]Okay.
[18:23.92]And the spit.
[18:24.87]Trollin', trollin', troll.
[18:28.01]And for this reason I live.
[18:30.66]Get off him.
[18:31.58]Alright, let's do this.
[18:32.76]Dude, just down the last guy and it's GG.
[18:37.52]Nah.
[18:37.76]Don't down him.
[18:38.50]Up.
[18:38.66]What?
[18:38.92]They're up.
[18:39.42]He's up.
[18:40.42]They're all going to be up.
[18:42.89]Oh, my God.
[18:44.91]Marky.
[18:46.81]Alright.
[18:47.87]Take some pills.
[18:48.67]Here, stealth.
[18:49.53]Take my pills.
[18:50.31]Oh, and you're, like, filming your screen with, like, a 30-millimeter camera.
[18:57.07]Oh, man.
[18:58.19]Oh, that's a dub cheeseburger right there.
[19:00.95]Snipe shiv.
[19:01.79]I think that's a... Oh no.
[19:02.97]Oh, I'm jockeyed.
[19:03.91]Not really sure.
[19:05.71]Oh, this is... Yes, a jockey.
[19:07.05]Look at those points we're racking up on the leaderboards right there.
[19:14.14]Oh my god, and I'm spit.
[19:17.90]Blacking out.
[19:18.62]That'd be a smoker, Asta.
[19:21.00]I am so... They're actually not doing too badly.
[19:25.36]They might actually regroup.
[19:28.16]They can't score more than we have.
[19:31.55]It's okay, though.
[19:34.99]Who keeps smoking?
[19:36.47]Quit shooting me, stealth!
[19:40.15]Let him do his thing.
[19:42.51]Dude, I'm gonna get the tank pretty soon.
[19:44.58]Oh, y'all fuckers are dead.
[19:49.92]Come here, Brett.
[19:51.72]Come here, Brett.
[19:53.24]I don't know what's going on.
[19:55.90]This is it.
[19:57.40]It's like the end of the line, boys.
[20:00.68]You're fucking done, son.
[20:02.56]Wow, I can't... I think I got... Yeah, I got killed by a shippy, which is ironic.
[20:06.34]Yeah.
[20:07.12]Now I'm gonna teabag you with the tank.
[20:08.53]That's not ironic at all.
[20:09.07]Teabag.
[20:09.21]You like this?
[20:09.49]Teabag.
[20:09.65]Gargle.
[20:09.79]My.
[20:09.85]Balls.
[20:09.97]I got TK'd.
[20:10.19]Gargle.
[20:10.33]Hell no.
[20:10.49]Screw everybody.
[20:10.89]Gargle.
[20:11.11]My.
[20:11.29]Balls.
[20:11.43]GG.
[20:11.51]No reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[20:29.10]Any last words from the losing team?
[20:30.88]Yeah, that one.
[20:32.10]Uh, hacks.
[20:34.05]Russian badger LOL.
