[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Tip of the Hats 2014, where almost $46,000 has been raised for One Step Camp, the camp that sends cancer-stricken children to camp for the summer to be kids again.
[00:18.73]I am joined by a plethora of names you will remember or know from earlier streams on the map that makes no sense, but it is Koth Train Saw Lasers.
[00:29.16]And ladies and gentlemen, if you haven't experienced this yet, buckle up and get ready for a ride.
[00:34.37]Gentlemen, would you guys like to introduce yourselves?
[00:39.43]There's a lot of us, so I'll do it.
[00:40.58]Seabear, what's up?
[00:42.02]Hey, I've been here all day.
[00:43.16]So I'm... As much as... This looks absolutely crazy.
[00:46.34]What in the F is going on?
[00:49.19]My God.
[00:49.75]I think maybe we'll throw it over to the creator of this nonsense that is UEAK Crash.
[00:56.40]Crash, are you with us?
[00:57.50]Yeah, what's up?
[00:58.36]Alright, so how high were you when you made this map?
[01:02.57]I was actually very drunk for most of it.
[01:05.83]Alright.
[01:06.01]It was very alcohol-fueled.
[01:07.77]alright so what inspired you to be on the alcohol to to make this impact uh... I just kept making it worse and worse really there there wasn't anything uh... I've had a server that we constantly played it on and uh... we kept testing it out and it progressively got funnier and funnier overtime how long did you make it
[01:26.84]Oh, it's way too long.
[01:28.08]I've put way too much time into a joke.
[01:31.63]Alright, for example... Probably a hundred hours, I would say.
[01:33.83]Oh my goodness.
[01:34.19]You wanna do a little explanation as to what's going on?
[01:36.29]Cause I've... I mean, we've talked about it before, we went live.
[01:39.18]This is not a regular map.
[01:40.86]Obviously there are lasers and apparently trains.
[01:43.80]which you want to avoid or they will kill you, correct?
[01:46.76]Yes, train rain.
[01:48.55]Train rain.
[01:49.51]The trains are hilariously weird looking.
[01:52.54]Can we get hashtag train rain started on Twitter?
[01:55.02]But yeah, Crash, tell us what's going on here.
[01:56.99]What do you need to avoid?
[01:58.43]Every time you capture the point, the train rain falls, and then there's obviously the hazards around that you'll find quickly.
[02:07.54]But also, at 100 sacrifices on the counter, there's going to be six different random events that pop up, which you'll notice.
[02:15.17]That was the train shark flying in the middle right now, and the saws rotating around.
[02:23.98]Are there spell books?
[02:24.92]Do I see spell books?
[02:25.78]Yep, you should have your spell books equipped because there are spells on this.
[02:30.16]Oh my goodness.
[02:31.00]So we do have exploding pumpkins.
[02:33.86]Yep, everything I could cram in there.
[02:36.35]Alright, well, we do have a brave assortment of players here to bring this on.
[02:41.57]One of the new ones for today is Tag.
[02:43.97]Tag, you want to say hello?
[02:46.02]Good morning.
[02:46.70]Good morning.
[02:47.46]Where are you?
[02:49.20]It's always morning somewhere, it doesn't, you know, universal thing.
[02:53.24]I guess that's fair.
[02:54.24]Tag, how do you feel to be waking up to this nonsense?
[02:57.78]I... This is crazier than any dream I've ever had, honestly.
[03:02.15]I don't even know where to begin.
[03:05.31]I think the word you're looking for is nightmare?
[03:12.22]And then we also have... I don't know what... You don't know what... I don't know what to expect ever.
[03:18.53]I'm actually just content with just staying outside.
[03:20.91]Okay, I'm dead.
[03:21.67]I just...
[03:23.11]Lasers on cap, apparently.
[03:27.39]Yeah, so good luck with that.
[03:29.07]For those of you who were following the schedule, we had Randomizer Pub going for this hour, but we've been having issues with that pub all day, that server all day, so we're just gonna throw it over to the greatest TF2 map ever made.
[03:43.29]But also with us, who else do we have in here?
[03:45.38]Who wants to give a shoutout?
[03:47.54]Sesko, you here with us?
[03:48.94]I am.
[03:50.10]Awesome.
[03:50.70]And then we also got... Cesco is the Jerma sound-alike.
[03:54.07]So you guys and gals might be a little confused as to who's actually talking.
[03:58.35]We were thinking about having some kind of game show where they both have you read a sentence and then you can figure out who actually just talked.
[04:05.30]But it's pretty funny.
[04:07.22]Cesco, you played in, what, was it the MGE thing?
[04:09.42]Or you played in something?
[04:10.18]No, I played in the Highlander pub where everyone thought it was America vs. E here, but...
[04:17.21]It wasn't.
[04:17.67]It was a pub.
[04:18.19]We tricked them all.
[04:21.01]Wait, what?
[04:21.89]It was fun.
[04:23.15]What was it exactly, then?
[04:24.48]We did it because America couldn't feel like a real... What is that nonsense?
[04:28.58]It's a satellite monster.
[04:30.10]I feel like I'm fighting the map more than Bluetooth.
[04:32.77]Yeah, basically.
[04:34.87]Alright, Crash, so explain this to us more.
[04:36.49]Why is the map so angry?
[04:39.45]The story behind it is that there is a cult that basically worships Train God, which is the trains and all the other maps.
[04:47.78]And you're trying to appease him with sacrifices.
[04:52.60]What?
[04:52.94]That train coming down that hallway right now.
[04:55.25]What kind of alcohol?
[04:56.57]I feel like I'm drunk right now.
[04:58.53]It's coming.
[04:58.91]It's chasing everyone.
[04:59.55]Turn.
[04:59.75]Watch out.
[05:00.01]Watch out.
[05:01.43]Watch out.
[05:01.81]What kind of alcohol?
[05:02.27]It's coming down the spawn.
[05:03.26]Apparently there's a 12-bladed saw blade.
[05:06.66]It's throwing out mini saw blades, and they explode.
[05:10.07]Have you seen the mini pumpkins that explode?
[05:12.33]I didn't know that was a thing.
[05:13.71]I think everything just shoots out mini versions of itself and they explode.
[05:17.78]Alright, so there's some graffiti around the map that says WWTGD.
[05:22.48]What does that mean?
[05:23.67]What would Train God do?
[05:25.63]Of course.
[05:27.25]Of course.
[05:29.62]Alright, then we also of course have Jerma in here.
[05:32.08]Jerma, how are you faring after all of this long day?
[05:37.53]Pretty good.
[05:37.85]The trains are kind of freaking me out, but this is awesome.
[05:43.20]This is like the best map I've ever played.
[05:46.82]What is that tiny voice that is talking?
[05:50.08]Yeah, what's like screaming?
[05:51.09]That is Lucy in the sky with lasers.
[05:53.09]What?
[05:53.49]Who is voiced by my wife.
[05:56.67]What?
[05:58.17]Was your wife as drunk as you when she did the voiceovers?
[06:05.04]And then Sesko, you did some of the voiceovers for this too, didn't you?
[06:08.91]Yeah, I did the hype video where everyone was like, what is tip of the hats?
[06:12.73]And apparently that's every time I get greeted when I join the server.
[06:16.72]It makes me laugh.
[06:20.27]So I'll be remembered by that and I guess the diaper.
[06:24.34]Dude, my favorite part about this is just the trains coming from the sky.
[06:27.27]It's just hilarious.
[06:27.99]Uh, look up into the sky right now.
[06:30.70]Holy crap.
[06:31.86]That is kinda terrifying.
[06:32.42]What is that?
[06:35.09]Is that just gonna crash on everybody?
[06:37.84]Where is this?
[06:39.33]I just hear a giant train.
[06:42.13]I don't see it.
[06:43.53]It looks straight in the sky, it's huge!
[06:49.66]Alright now, Crash, what other maps did you draw inspiration from for this map?
[06:55.97]It's actually, if you look at it from a top down, it's really based on Viaduct.
[06:59.83]I actually did try to take some serious gameplay ideas for it.
[07:03.70]No, really?
[07:04.38]Despite all the hazards.
[07:07.15]But yeah, it's got a lot of the same routes, just kind of laid out a little bit differently.
[07:13.02]Alright, alright.
[07:13.82]So your intention was just for this to be a fun type pub map, not competitive at all?
[07:18.73]Yeah, we play it every Friday on our server, the House of Nonconformity, the Penny Arcade server, Hong Kong.
[07:26.32]I just keep making it more and more intense for them, basically.
[07:31.26]Wait, so you're adding it?
[07:32.36]Adding to this?
[07:33.31]I actually can't anymore.
[07:34.99]It's pushing the limits of what is possible without crashing a server.
[07:40.58]What?
[07:40.98]So if I add any more, I go over the entity count.
[07:43.68]I believe that.
[07:46.67]So it's about done.
[07:48.59]I actually am going to be releasing Release Candidate 1 as a joke for April Fool's Day here upcoming, which will be played on TF2 Maps April Fool's Game Day that we're doing.
[07:59.19]Why didn't Mini Week get to play this?
[08:02.08]Do you want to say more about that, the April Fool's TFT Maps event?
[08:08.07]Yeah, we have it every year.
[08:09.91]I think it's the third year this next year, and this map kind of was the inaugural run of this map was the first year that it happened.
[08:17.69]I've been adding to it every year since then.
[08:19.39]And it's just basically all the mappers who make serious maps get together and make something stupid and throw it on there.
[08:28.02]I actually have another map called King of the Hill Wub Wub Wub, which is a dubstep-inspired map, or like the montage parody videos.
[08:38.37]It's sort of based on that in map form.
[08:43.56]I have no idea what that means, but I'm scared.
[08:48.04]I feel like this should be played in the SCA.
[08:49.87]Why not?
[08:50.75]I'd love to cast this.
[08:51.31]It should be pre-season.
[08:53.69]I know Sal casted a video and he hated it, I think, because it goes on for a while sometimes, but it was really funny.
[09:01.74]Something to put up on the invite bug list.
[09:07.41]Trying to figure... trying to remember how to use spells.
[09:11.19]I'm seeing this ramp that says Demoman can charge up orange ramps.
[09:15.69]What is that, Crash?
[09:17.17]Uh, yep, if you charge at them as a Demoman, it'll launch you into the sky.
[09:21.74]It's pretty straightforward.
[09:23.46]Alright, can we get some Demoman to charge up these, like, orange-ish, yellow-ish ramps?
[09:27.33]On it.
[09:28.53]Thank you.
[09:29.31]You're a hero.
[09:29.97]And there is an exploding pumpkin at the top, so watch out for that as well.
[09:36.46]Who did this train rain thing?
[09:40.11]like boys that that is odd friend mine carnage me chopper I know he's skier yep scary spooky so good news there's so many just death thorns have you received as a result of this map I actually get a lot of positive feedback on as it is this is unbelievable balance what you learn it's it's pretty decent I think other skeletons around
[10:10.33]Scary spooky skeletons.
[10:12.54]They're like gremlins.
[10:14.40]The big saw blade rotating around is the best thing.
[10:19.15]That's just awesome.
[10:21.00]I wanna see if you can actually jump up these things with the other demo.
[10:25.35]Whoa, mama!
[10:28.95]He was never seen again.
[10:30.79]Have you made any other maps, Crash, that we could give you accolades for?
[10:36.05]Yeah, I actually... CP Stony Ridge was a big project that I worked on for a long time.
[10:41.52]And I've got a couple other maps.
[10:44.32]Probably the one that you guys would want to check out is CP Glassworks, which is actually getting some UGC testing right now, and they seem to really like it.
[10:52.39]So I know they were kind of... There were some rumors going around of possibly playing it in the fall season.
[10:59.42]Oh, wow.
[11:00.10]That's awesome.
[11:01.08]Yeah, but it's a very early version right now.
[11:03.07]It's in early alpha, so it's got a lot of work before it starts looking good.
[11:06.31]I just ran over the laser.
[11:11.06]I just did a demo charge and tripped over the laser.
[11:16.33]I think it's time for a Jerma vs. Sesko sound off.
[11:21.82]You think?
[11:22.40]Should we do that now?
[11:23.72]Give us a phrase.
[11:24.82]What sound do you want us to make?
[11:28.57]Well, hold on.
[11:28.99]You said that you can beatbox, right?
[11:30.76]Do we have a beatboxer?
[11:33.38]I guess a Jerma's kind of a pro.
[11:36.03]Did you hear that?
[11:37.63]You might want to reword that.
[11:40.44]A box-off?
[11:41.70]A beatbox-off.
[11:43.62]Did I really say that?
[11:44.60]Okay, well, let's rewind the last 20 seconds, we'll go back to... For the kids!
[11:50.52]Let's have a beatbox!
[11:53.07]Competition, question mark, and then I'm gonna leave and never come back.
[11:56.77]Leave and never come back.
[11:58.39]Goodbye.
[12:00.73]Should we start with Jerma?
[12:03.60]In ten minutes or less, tell us your opinion of this map.
[12:06.76]In a beatbox.
[12:07.46]In ten minutes or less?
[12:08.60]Yes, in less than ten minutes.
[12:10.44]That's a pretty long beatbox!
[12:12.68]That's like, uh, Stairway to Heaven.
[12:16.14]Beatbox.
[12:16.60]Hey, I just... Or less.
[12:18.76]Or less.
[12:19.66]Alright, well, I'm kinda tired.
[12:22.61]It's been a long day.
[12:25.13]I've had, like, multiple diarrhea's.
[12:28.03]So, like, I'll try.
[12:29.00]I'll try.
[12:31.94]Why is the map shaking, by the way?
[12:33.90]I think we're about to die.
[12:35.14]I cannot see this giant, this favorite chain.
[12:38.53]No, yeah, that's what's gonna happen.
[12:40.25]I can't see it.
[12:41.55]I'm dying to scary spooky skeletons though.
[12:47.74]Feels like I'm playing Majora's Mask right now.
[12:57.57]Do you say words when you beatbox?
[13:00.45]Because I just beatbox and beatbox.
[13:03.16]Sometimes.
[13:04.50]Because I can't do that.
[13:08.89]You can just give the impression that sounds make according to this map or something of that sort.
[13:15.86]If you can't think of words, just make noises.
[13:17.16]I don't think I can cultivate a sound this... I don't know.
[13:23.01]What's a big word from the English dictionary?
[13:30.70]Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
[13:32.40]Excellent, yeah.
[13:33.24]Anti-disestablishmentarianism?
[13:37.64]Jeremy, you got something for us here, or should we just move on?
[13:40.23]Alright, here we go, here we go.
[13:41.85]Yo, break it down, break it down.
[13:43.65]Here we go.
[13:48.88]We got the trains.
[13:50.92]There.
[13:52.98]Falling from the sky.
[14:03.50]Train.
[14:06.68]Train.
[14:09.81]Shut up!
[14:22.10]Well, he came in and screamed.
[14:27.27]Alright, awesome!
[14:28.69]I don't know if I can top that.
[14:30.82]Well, during that time we reached $47,000, so, uh, yeah, Sesko, I think the ball is in your court if you want to be able to top that, or, uh, bring in another thousand.
[14:39.85]So we gotta be at $48,000 by the time Sesko is done with his beatbox.
[14:44.57]Good luck, bud.
[14:46.36]No pressure.
[14:47.66]My stomach just fell.
[14:50.82]My throat.
[14:52.31]all they know is I don't only know how to do one thing and do the one thing I'm going to do the one thing that I know hang on it's kind of bad but I gotta prepare I gotta hold on you prepare one second I have a hundred dollar donation from the duet
[15:17.69]Cindy, thank you very much for $100.
[15:20.18]No comment, but we really appreciate it.
[15:22.11]I think that was just over that last milestone, 47, I believe.
[15:26.64]Is that correct?
[15:28.60]$47,000.
[15:29.80]Absolutely fantastic.
[15:31.90]Thank you so much, guys.
[15:32.90]We still, I think $50,000 as well in our sights here for today.
[15:38.75]We're trying to get even more than that.
[15:40.44]That's chump change, yeah.
[15:42.68]Totally do that by next hour.
[15:45.36]I have a $50 donation from Nicholas Hammer Store.
[15:49.59]Hammer.
[15:50.31]which is the best last name ever.
[15:52.84]Thanks, Nick.
[15:53.84]For the kids, if they see this, have fun, and hope you kids enjoy yourselves and get better soon.
[15:58.87]Stay strong, and best wishes from Down Under, a.k.a.
[16:02.39]Australia.
[16:04.03]Oh, nice.
[16:05.11]Thank you very much, and good morning to you, sir.
[16:07.34]Hopefully you're still watching and enjoying yourself.
[16:10.26]Waking up just like Tag.
[16:12.10]That's right.
[16:12.90]I just gotta say, Australians have the best accents in the world, so... I like the Boston boys, or whatever.
[16:19.93]Oh, yeah, Cisco is a cutie.
[16:23.99]Yeah, I wouldn't say that, but... Oh, we got a... We got a one-cent donation from Jerma's mother, who says, LOL.
[16:33.08]Thank you, Jerma's mother.
[16:34.49]Aw, thanks.
[16:35.05]Thanks, Mom.
[16:36.39]Thanks, Mom.
[16:38.47]And all she has to say is, LOL.
[16:42.46]Woman of a few words, but it gets there.
[16:46.96]Sesko, do you have something for us yet?
[16:48.46]Are you, uh, warmed up?
[16:49.95]I feel bad putting him on the spot for an 8,000 kills.
[16:52.43]I do too.
[16:52.69]I guess I'm as warmed up as I gotta be.
[16:54.79]I can't do it.
[16:55.63]Just do your thing.
[16:56.77]I just gotta... You gotta prepare.
[16:59.07]Like, I know what you're talking about.
[17:00.65]You gotta, like, prepare for it.
[17:01.79]I know, I feel you.
[17:02.32]We're almost like the same person.
[17:05.26]Yeah, we've got more in common than everybody knows.
[17:07.46]Maybe we should use our powers together.
[17:10.94]Do, like, a super beatbox?
[17:12.64]Oh my god, you just read my mind.
[17:15.81]Oh my god.
[17:17.59]Sesko does the beats and Jerma does the lyrics.
[17:21.25]Which is training.
[17:22.72]Star screams.
[17:23.96]Star will just scream.
[17:26.56]That's the drop.
[17:29.26]It's the kick.
[17:33.65]There's fire on this map too?
[17:34.89]I didn't even know that.
[17:36.03]There's everything.
[17:36.85]Surprises me every time.
[17:38.53]I haven't found this out yet.
[17:40.08]Is the green stuff, does that hurt you?
[17:41.62]Because I'm scared of it.
[17:44.28]For sure.
[17:45.70]For sure.
[17:46.79]Slowly, but yes.
[17:47.85]For sure.
[17:49.79]This laser in spawn that says free uber, is that a free uber?
[17:54.90]I've died to that laser too many times.
[17:56.02]Yes, actually, if you jump into it, it'll uber you every single time.
[17:59.83]I've died to that laser too many times.
[18:05.58]Alright, I think I'm just gonna wing it.
[18:08.22]We're gonna start slow, there's gonna be no loot, and then it's gonna maybe get a little faster.
[18:15.00]So if you want to chime in any time, myself or Jim, go for it.
[18:18.88]I feel like you got a donation from someone.
[18:21.11]Read the donation.
[18:22.53]Do that first.
[18:24.25]Well, oh.
[18:25.83]We got a $50 donation from Star saying, stop the singing.
[18:32.40]Well, I don't know, Star, if $50 is enough to buy Sezko.
[18:37.66]He was born to sing.
[18:39.83]I know, Sezko can do it.
[18:41.43]Jim can.
[18:42.61]Sezko's awesome.
[18:43.92]Jerma's not?
[18:45.33]Okay.
[18:45.63]They're the same person.
[18:46.55]We should collab and do Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
[18:48.91]We have a $100 donation from Seagull on a Barge.
[18:54.26]I spent my summers working at camp, so I'm totally behind this.
[18:56.78]Hugs and kisses to everybody who organized this because y'all are awesome.
[19:01.87]Thank you.
[19:02.65]Now, Lang and Truck Truck and Mobla, you guys have to have a three-way man kiss.
[19:09.52]Aw.
[19:09.80]What?
[19:13.98]Or a hawk, I guess.
[19:17.26]For the ladies.
[19:18.92]Not invited, I see.
[19:20.39]Okay, see you later.
[19:25.77]I'm stuck under here.
[19:26.54]I can't get out of here.
[19:27.36]Damn, that guy got roped, roped, roped, roped, roped.
[19:37.37]I guess it's roasted.
[19:45.96]Ah!
[19:53.65]That's all I got.
[19:54.63]Get it!
[19:56.31]Nice!
[19:56.89]I can only do the wubs, where you go Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, and Whisker.
[20:01.64]That was, he had the drop there too.
[20:03.26]Oh, that kid got ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-
[20:16.50]Well, while we're here on this ridiculous map, I want to pick the brain of UEAK Crash a little bit more.
[20:22.55]I honestly don't know what questions to ask here, but there's water beneath the point, right?
[20:29.50]Yeah.
[20:30.00]And there's a health pack, which is nice.
[20:31.83]It's a full health pack.
[20:32.87]And then right under that, there's... What is that?
[20:36.41]That would be another saw.
[20:38.08]Also, it also should be noted that the quadruple saw blade thing that spits out mini saw blade babies passes through their underwater thing again.
[20:49.44]Like a little shark.
[20:51.14]So you got more saws to worry about.
[20:52.48]After making maps for a really long time, sometimes you just start hating players.
[21:00.83]That's a good philosophy.
[21:02.14]Wow.
[21:03.54]So this is sort of payback a little bit.
[21:06.01]Okay, for all the cool people that are donating, trying to capitalize on that one joke of someone's mom, yeah, it's not funny.
[21:13.55]You know, whatever.
[21:14.29]I'm not going to read anymore.
[21:15.83]So how many mothers do we have now?
[21:18.01]We got many mothers.
[21:18.96]I'm not going to read anymore.
[21:21.08]Let's hope they just go away.
[21:24.09]Sorry.
[21:27.48]Thank you for the $40, mystery person anonymous.
[21:31.02]We appreciate it.
[21:31.78]And $50 from Shaggy.
[21:34.12]No comment.
[21:35.23]Thank you, Shaggy.
[21:36.57]Also, before we continue with the silliness, what a challenge.
[21:40.39]A challenge right now to everybody in the stream.
[21:42.06]Let's get the $48,000 before the end of this whatever is going on nonsense-a-thon.
[21:47.92]I want to see $48,000, and then hopefully once we get to the surfing, we can just finish it up and get into the $50,000s.
[21:54.17]Surfing is next.
[21:55.13]It's going to be two hours of ridiculous, awesome fun.
[21:58.06]But this is all sorts of crazy with trains and razor blades and all the good things that makes TF2 fun.
[22:04.62]So 48k, I challenge you, tip of the hat viewer.
[22:08.53]Let's make it happen.
[22:13.29]So did Cisco make it to 48k during his beatboxing?
[22:16.23]No, but that was respectable.
[22:17.88]I think that was good.
[22:18.84]That was good.
[22:19.92]That was very, very nice.
[22:21.68]A lot of talent here.
[22:23.38]A lot of talent.
[22:26.86]So, UEA Kid Crash, any other ridiculous maps on the horizon for you or the mapping community in general that we need to look out for?
[22:35.99]Definitely the next one that I'm working on, King of the Hill, wub wub wub.
[22:40.23]It gets really, really nuts.
[22:41.59]We tested it last night on our server, and I put an epilepsy warning at the beginning of it.
[22:47.70]I'll just say that much.
[22:51.10]What?
[22:51.36]What?
[22:53.76]What?
[22:55.31]Yeah, I don't want to spoil too much on it, but it's crazy.
[23:00.62]Alright, something to look forward to.
[23:01.96]For the kids!
[23:03.43]Right?
[23:06.85]For the kids.
[23:08.18]See you later, Sizer.
[23:09.52]So has there been a winner in this?
[23:10.94]I've been clicking through links and looking at donations and stuff.
[23:15.54]As we do have the return of Bloodsire, who will absolutely love this map.
[23:18.23]I don't know if there's room for you, Blood.
[23:19.83]Sorry, buddy.
[23:20.29]Well, Sizer right now is leading with 67 points as Engineer, so I guess he's the winner?
[23:26.82]Big pause.
[23:28.34]Not even in here.
[23:29.06]Doing the other thing.
[23:30.00]The only way you win on this map is if you play Charged ML, so... It's just a fraud.
[23:34.23]I think you're all winners for just bearing the pain.
[23:38.44]So is it possible, as a map maker you'd be able to answer this question, is it possible to make a map, like you know how prop hunt is, you're like props, what if you got to be the king sawblade, what if somebody got to be that?
[23:51.10]You'd probably have to use mods for that one, I don't think I could do it as just a mapper, but I'm sure somebody could do it.
[23:56.30]If you're at the what?
[23:57.66]Oh you'd have to use like a server plugin or some kind of mod for it.
[24:02.91]Are we talking about a map where you're the control point and you run away from everyone?
[24:06.92]No, you're the big saw.
[24:07.40]You're one of the big saw things.
[24:08.54]You're just a big saw flying around.
[24:10.18]I got really excited.
[24:12.56]You are the control point and you just move around?
[24:14.55]I've always wanted to be a control point.
[24:16.31]That's actually kind of funny.
[24:19.77]You just keep running away and somebody has to cap you.
[24:23.26]Don't let him cap you.
[24:24.20]You have to get sandmanned and then you can finally be capped.
[24:30.15]We just got a $100 donation from TMA.
[24:33.11]I think I've seen that name already.
[24:35.36]No comment and a very, just kind of an alias name to an already alias person.
[24:41.51]But thank you so much, Joseph.
[24:42.84]Really appreciate it.
[24:44.38]And we are getting closer to that goal that I just set for you guys, 48K.
[24:49.42]Alright, so don't make Seabear look like an idiot.
[24:51.68]Let's get to that 49k before the hour.
[24:53.17]I'll do a good enough job of that myself.
[24:55.07]Thank you very much.
[24:55.97]Now let's get back to the beatbox off.
[24:58.39]Oh, God, what did I say?
[24:59.50]Wait a minute.
[25:00.56]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[25:01.80]What was that?
[25:03.06]Something about Seabear beatboxing for us?
[25:05.29]No, I'm way too old for that.
[25:08.19]No, you don't.
[25:08.65]We're about the same old, so... I'm like Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon, right?
[25:12.86]I'm too old for this.
[25:13.99]He doesn't target them, it's fine.
[25:16.57]I mean, you just always proved how old you are.
[25:18.43]I embarrassed myself thoroughly enough the last tip of the hat, so I think that you can go check VODs if you really want to see me with foot and mouth.
[25:26.53]I don't know.
[25:26.93]People are asking what happens when we get to 48k.
[25:29.61]I don't know.
[25:30.13]I was thinking of something.
[25:31.35]I'm talking to Shamba.
[25:32.21]We want to spice it up a little bit and get something, but we have a lot of prizes in store for being given away tomorrow.
[25:38.02]It's not a good sentence at all.
[25:39.71]The thing is, I could say, I'm going to do this crazy thing, but
[25:43.03]The thing is, nobody wants to hear or see something like that, probably.
[25:46.69]And it'd be like, what's a bear with sleep error?
[25:49.50]And then, you know, people would just be like, oh, that's kind of awkward.
[25:52.26]And then it'd be like, oh.
[25:54.72]I don't know.
[25:55.04]If there's something good, an idea that's good, I'll do it.
[25:57.08]I don't know.
[25:57.52]Alright, so I'm in the server.
[25:58.76]Like, what am I looking at?
[26:00.81]If we get to 4,900 by the end of this hour, so we have 30 minutes, I think we'll be alright there.
[26:06.83]But if we get to 4,900, I will drop a hundo into the pot.
[26:11.48]Alright?
[26:12.96]Ooh.
[26:13.02]And then Star will give another $100.
[26:15.06]Thanks, Star.
[26:16.48]Can we maybe say that Tag will eat an enormous donut on stream also?
[26:20.01]Oh, please!
[26:22.59]Tag will eat, like, the ridiculous barrel of, uh, tropical Skittles live on stream.
[26:29.60]Look at me started on that.
[26:30.99]Is there any part of this map where you can spawn pumpkins on Tag?
[26:34.93]Like, is that coded in?
[26:36.41]Please no.
[26:38.10]I wish I could do something like that.
[26:40.93]I just drop one on everybody.
[26:42.93]The most painful part of this map is just walking around corners and just running into the lasers that are on walls.
[26:50.52]That's 90% of my deaths.
[26:52.40]Yeah, trying to pick up the health packs and ammo.
[26:55.10]I got a, I got a like a, just like a newbie question here.
[26:58.49]How do I join a team?
[26:59.99]It's not letting me.
[27:02.85]Uh, is your interp set correctly?
[27:04.61]Yeah, pretty sure.
[27:05.63]Pretty sure I'll call with the interp check.
[27:07.72]Is your computer turned on?
[27:08.98]Yep, that's turned on, too.
[27:10.54]Did you plug in your mouse?
[27:11.66]That's also working.
[27:12.88]Are you connected to the internet?
[27:14.82]I am connected to the internet.
[27:15.81]I am watching the server.
[27:17.67]Did you sacrifice to the train god?
[27:21.23]No, I sacrificed to the old gods and the new.
[27:24.62]Submitted to the train god.
[27:27.34]To the train god.
[27:28.12]Have you had any cheese today?
[27:30.91]Yes.
[27:31.25]Because that can give you an upset stomach.
[27:32.65]Ha ha ha!
[27:37.85]He's watching out for you.
[27:40.45]Thank you.
[27:40.67]I've seen this question throughout the day, and I don't think anyone has answered this, so I'm gonna throw it in.
[27:46.68]I didn't see whose name it was, but somebody has consistently been asking, what's your spirit animal on chat?
[27:53.69]And I'm wondering if anyone at least has a response to that, eh?
[27:56.69]My spirit animal is BeastBoy.
[27:58.65]There you go!
[27:59.27]Alright, BeastBoy.
[28:00.91]It's a running thing on my Twitter account.
[28:03.36]Justin you're the best you're actually the best I figured it out well listen when I asked for info I assume it's the correct info that is correct yep he's married to his interp it's beautiful it's beautiful really
[28:31.44]Any other questions in chat, send them out for anybody in here.
[28:34.67]We do have Jermastar, Sezko, Tag, and Seabear and Bloodsire, and I am Kip if you have any questions whatsoever.
[28:43.62]We do have another half hour of this nonsense.
[28:47.55]I have a question.
[28:48.89]What's your intro?
[28:50.21]No, Tag, who didn't you look at on the bus today?
[28:54.10]You on the bus today?
[28:56.52]We like questions.
[28:57.56]No, I haven't gone on the bus in a while.
[28:59.08]I've been on break.
[29:00.83]Oh.
[29:01.46]So you didn't have to look at anyone.
[29:03.03]No, I didn't.
[29:03.57]It was very nice, actually.
[29:05.53]Awesome.
[29:07.09]So why do you ask that question?
[29:08.55]No, actually, you missed out on a really nice tweet.
[29:11.53]There was a lady who was doing ceramic work across from me on the bus, and I took a sneaky picture, and I just was too lazy to upload it.
[29:20.60]Did you tell her at any point, like, you know, nice ceramics, or did you just, like, sneak the picture in and then go lurk off into your bat cave?
[29:28.57]No, that's exactly what I did.
[29:29.92]She was making faces in her clay.
[29:34.60]Just a very strange place to do clay making on the bus.
[29:37.63]That is pretty weird.
[29:40.65]What do we got?
[29:41.71]Jerma, we have some questions about eggs.
[29:43.67]I don't know, it's been going really fast.
[29:45.56]All I see is jermaEgg a lot of times.
[29:48.61]Can you answer that question?
[29:50.33]Something about egg?
[29:51.12]Yeah, yeah.
[29:52.66]What you want to do is, it's hard boiled.
[29:55.50]It's seven to eight minutes, I believe, in a boiling water.
[29:59.88]Once you take them out, you peel them off, and you put a little bit of salt on that, put a little pepper on that.
[30:04.73]Wait, were we just talking about trains and buses or something?
[30:07.35]Where is this coming from?
[30:08.87]We're talking about eggs now, sir.
[30:10.90]We've moved on to eggs.
[30:12.02]Where have you been?
[30:13.40]I don't know.
[30:13.96]It's very important.
[30:14.68]I was staring at Pao's thing on the ground, the check.
[30:18.35]None of you guys know.
[30:20.38]The stream knows.
[30:23.43]The stream does.
[30:24.47]$10 donation from hipofthetat.
[30:28.02]Thank you very much for the $10.
[30:34.65]We have a $150 donation from Abel Sly Fox.
[30:42.86]No comment, but thank you very much, Mr. Fox.
[30:46.33]And I recently found out what you say.
[30:50.12]Seabare, here's a question for you.
[30:52.23]Yes.
[30:52.77]Have you ever been to summer camp as a child?
[30:54.77]Of course I did.
[30:56.15]I live in the Midwest, okay?
[30:57.95]I know, right?
[30:58.51]She's never visited me, though.
[30:59.39]I'm in the Midwest, too.
[31:00.94]So, Tag, wait.
[31:02.28]You said you have been to summer camp?
[31:04.28]Yeah.
[31:05.02]Oh, I'm in Chicago.
[31:05.74]I'm just saying, you know.
[31:07.16]Yeah, so can we get a Midwest represent?
[31:09.45]Hashtag Midwest for Ev.
[31:12.59]So, Tag, and I think Seabare actually left chat.
[31:15.83]So, Tag, was summer camp not the best years of your life?
[31:18.92]Summer camp...
[31:22.18]I don't even remember summer camp.
[31:23.71]I have.
[31:25.03]Too awesome?
[31:25.85]I have an announcement to make.
[31:27.13]I have an announcement!
[31:28.65]Say bye!
[31:29.37]We are going to Badwater.
[31:31.27]Oh, thank god.
[31:32.20]So, that was fun.
[31:33.70]But I feel like that's, um... I'm trying to think of an analogy.
[31:38.08]You know, limited amount of something like that is good.
[31:41.69]Like, you don't want to do that for 40 minutes.
[31:43.53]Nutella.
[31:43.89]Yeah!
[31:44.05]It's like Nutella.
[31:45.25]Yeah, trust me, you do not want to eat Nutella for 40 minutes straight.
[31:48.37]I'm not.
[31:49.83]I've never had that yet.
[31:52.04]But we do want to give a shout out to UAAK Crash for this amazing map.
[31:56.25]Thank you so much, Crash.
[31:57.63]Thank you for having it and playing it.
[31:59.76]It's definitely a trip if you guys haven't checked it out yet.
[32:02.47]And do you want to give a shout out to your community once more?
[32:05.55]Yeah, at the Penny Arcade House of Nonconformity.
[32:09.59]Awesome, awesome.
[32:10.21]And once again, thanks.
[32:11.37]Shout out to Tragic Shivers, who has been providing the service all throughout tonight.
[32:14.71]Looks like we are going to be continuing on to a pub on Badwater.
[32:18.65]Only the greatest map ever made.
[32:20.32]I'm sorry, Crash, but nothing can improve on perfection that is Badwater.
[32:24.30]You know, I'm an idiot, by the way, guys and gals.
[32:26.10]You know this already, but TMA, who's donated quite a bit during the course of up to today, is someone that we know.
[32:33.95]He's the person that we know.
[32:35.25]Can you guys figure out who TMA might be based off of his initials?
[32:40.38]The Master Star?
[32:43.67]I don't know what the A stands for.
[32:44.69]What could the A possibly stand for?
[32:46.47]I'll give you a hint.
[32:48.90]The middle initial stands for Much.
[32:52.42]Inappropriate.
[32:53.44]Okay, sorry.
[32:54.12]We'll move on.
[32:55.18]Thank you very much.
[32:57.61]Thank you very much, TMA.
[32:59.13]I love you dearly.
[33:00.33]Your name is actually the best.
[33:02.62]So it's not Tony Hawk?
[33:05.74]It's not Teenage Mutant Adult Turtles?
[33:09.48]It actually is.
[33:11.64]I thought TMP changed classes, I don't know.
[33:15.81]That's what I was thinking, but it... Alright, so yeah, shoutout to him.
[33:20.87]Or her.
[33:21.75]The chat just capitalized screaming it right now.
[33:26.30]There it is!
[33:27.44]Oh, what?
[33:28.83]We just broke...
[33:29.91]48k while I was, um, thinking of my name.
[33:33.84]Thanks, TMA, for breaking 48k.
[33:34.80]Dude, noice.
[33:35.76]TMA, you're the best.
[33:36.24]Does that mean Seabear raps for us?
[33:37.96]Yeah, no, I'm not rapping.
[33:38.66]I'm gonna donate another hundred, so thank you so much, guys and gals.
[33:41.57]$48,000, all before the surf segment.
[33:44.83]Unbelievable.
[33:45.49]Let's get to 50k tonight.
[33:47.54]I'm feeling it.
[33:49.42]Completely possible.
[33:50.70]I'm gonna give you all a big kiss.
[33:53.89]Mwah.
[33:54.65]Oh, that was so cute.
[33:56.15]You missed.
[33:59.95]I want to go back to this camp thing because if we are forgetting that the main reason we're doing this is for kids with cancer who can't afford the opportunity to go to summer camp now will be able to where they could just forget about all the hospitals and tests and needles and stuff like that and just be kids at summer camp.
[34:16.47]And I want to share experiences of summer camp for those of us who were fortunate enough to go.
[34:21.08]I love summer camp.
[34:22.58]That's all I'm going to say.
[34:23.56]Swimming when it's like 100 degrees outside in the middle of a forest in a swimming pool is just like the most amazing thing.
[34:29.43]And summer camp for me was like a huge deal.
[34:31.81]So I can't imagine how it is for these kids that are benefiting from one-step camp.
[34:35.97]Does anyone else want to share a summer camp story?
[34:39.26]I would like to share that 48k gets, which is obviously, Chris donated $300.48, which tipped us
[34:50.29]Over the Limit, and he says, shout out to Smurfy Fortress in Australia.
[34:57.43]Indeed.
[34:58.21]Thank you so much, Australia.
[35:00.09]You guys are so awesome.
[35:01.74]I hope you have summer camps there.
[35:04.67]Just watch out for the bugs.
[35:07.33]The dingos.
[35:08.63]The box jellyfish.
[35:11.00]There are nine soldiers on red team right now.
[35:14.70]It's time to go with the eights!
[35:16.06]No, no, no.
[35:16.70]It was like everyone joined soldiers.
[35:19.11]It was a silent agreement.
[35:20.69]That was crazy.
[35:22.61]I just saw like seven people rocket jump over my head.
[35:25.56]So how many Injis are gunslinging on blue is the question.
[35:29.62]Hey, Star.
[35:30.56]Hi.
[35:31.16]I think the chat has something to say to you.
[35:34.05]They think they have a request.
[35:37.28]You say my name.
[35:39.33]It has to do- guess what it has to do with, Star?
[35:40.99]No, no, of course I've seen it!
[35:42.55]How could I- I have the stream open!
[35:44.83]I'm well aware that people want to know how to pull it off.
[35:47.44]What's the question?
[35:49.38]How do you pull it off?
[35:50.84]How do you pull it off?
[35:51.52]Pull- pull what off?
[35:52.32]I thought it was singing the Strongbox song.
[35:54.89]No!
[35:55.83]I saw that a bunch of times.
[35:57.07]It's for the kids, Star.
[36:01.07]Oh, you- Mela.
[36:02.92]Sad face.
[36:03.26]Mela.
[36:03.44]I don't have any kids.
[36:04.50]I am a legend.
[36:06.65]Help us make this event twice as big as the last.
[36:10.27]Help us put a smile on that child's face.
[36:12.91]What's up, man?
[36:13.96]50,000 before Sunday.
[36:15.56]Let's make that our new goal and hashtag if you're tweeting.
[36:19.14]I just want to point out, I headshot an air flying soldier, followed by... What's up, dude?
[36:25.19]What's up, dude?
[36:26.29]Don't make me bring the pumpkins in here.
[36:30.25]I'm sorry, what happened again?
[36:31.56]This is devolving quickly into nonsense in chat.
[36:33.92]Dude, the chat is going absolutely bonkers right now.
[36:36.80]Oh my goodness.
[36:37.91]What was it that they called Star earlier in that donation?
[36:41.45]It's going quackers?
[36:43.17]Chat is going quackers right now.
[36:45.08]Star, there's only one man that can save the day.
[36:47.24]And there's only one way that that man can save the day.
[36:49.96]Batman.
[36:51.20]With money.
[36:52.49]Star, they call us for heroism.
[36:54.29]Do you accept the charges?
[36:55.95]Don't make me get my pitch pipe, Star.
[36:58.19]Alright?
[36:58.33]Look at this chat.
[37:02.14]This chat is like total chaos.
[37:04.93]You're killing sick.
[37:06.57]You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself turn into a crate.
[37:15.02]What is the crate song, by the way?
[37:17.27]Is it a thing?
[37:18.21]Is it a song you did in the video?
[37:20.09]I have never sung a song ever.
[37:21.56]I don't support singing in any way.
[37:23.70]You didn't make a video either, did you?
[37:27.02]I didn't see the video.
[37:28.61]Lying to the children.
[37:29.45]For the kids.
[37:32.65]Is that tag?
[37:34.90]Hi.
[37:36.32]How late are you?
[37:39.87]Later you.
[37:40.86]Cisco did you just get to know a smile on a child's face with that crew rocket we are less than two thousand dollars away so regardless if star is gonna sing a crate song or strong back song I don't I don't know what that's about you should donate anyway because we're two thousand dollars away from our goal of fifty thousand before a Sunday night or Sunday morning I guess
[38:06.19]um but regardless also coming up next don't go anywhere because it's the event of the season is this surfing event see where you're gonna be a part of that right
[38:15.49]Yeah, I'm going to look questionably at what's going on and try to figure it out.
[38:18.67]Were they really talented people doing the thing?
[38:20.99]Yeah, I know.
[38:21.72]It's like, are you really that talented or are they cheating somehow?
[38:25.06]And then it's like, why am I watching somebody cheat at this game?
[38:27.56]Because it's just so ridiculous.
[38:29.33]Yeah, and we're going into Counter-Strike Source as well to be extra awesome.
[38:32.63]So I have no idea what's going to happen, guys.
[38:34.91]The last year's event was amazing.
[38:40.29]chat move this fast.
[38:41.06]This looks like Twitch plays Pokémon.
[38:44.67]Everybody pile on Star.
[38:47.05]Up, down, left, A, B, A, B, up, down.
[38:49.22]We're now only in subscribers only mode.
[38:51.25]That is legit.
[38:52.21]So Star, only one man can stop this.
[38:55.70]Not even here.
[38:57.06]Oh, okay.
[38:57.38]Well, Star's not here, apparently.
[38:59.50]So, I gotta ask you, Saber, what does it mean when you say you're going to CS Counter-Strike?
[39:05.47]Well, obviously, we've only played TF2 today.
[39:08.07]We're not actually going to play Source.
[39:09.98]We're not going to get into a knife fight with a bunch of other idiots, but no, we are going to... I guess surfing the engine in Source is different, maybe better, but certainly different, and other maps...
[39:20.29]um are either better or they're only on the source engine compared to TF2 so they're gonna do some different thing there I don't know truck truck and the surfers are gonna do all the real stuff I'm just gonna sit here and look pretty alright sounds good star for the love of god stop this insanity I feel like you like it how is this possible what no this is oh my I'm gonna vomit
[39:45.67]Is it in slow mode?
[39:47.17]It's in slow mode and subscriber mode, isn't it?
[39:49.28]It keeps going back and forth.
[39:50.62]We don't have a subscriber button.
[39:52.16]Yeah, there's no subscriber button.
[39:55.61]Star, any comment on this, Star?
[39:57.55]Or should we continue trying to pretend this doesn't exist?
[40:00.25]I don't know what's happening.
[40:01.25]There's nothing happening.
[40:02.65]Alright.
[40:03.09]Alright.
[40:03.37]Okay.
[40:03.53]Apparently, Star has no balls.
[40:05.13]So, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:06.35]Wow.
[40:07.97]I'm calling it, yes.
[40:09.24]Did you just call him out for having no stones?
[40:11.94]Yes.
[40:12.34]Star, you have no stones.
[40:13.22]I don't know what chat is asking you to do, but you are literally ball-less.
[40:16.44]You have less balls than I do right now.
[40:19.91]Wow.
[40:21.23]Maybe he'll get to go to this camp.
[40:23.41]Rest in peace.
[40:24.47]Tip of the hat's down.
[40:25.55]That is worst thing I've ever seen.
[40:28.55]Completely rested.
[40:29.47]Comment, Star?
[40:31.85]Nothing!
[40:32.43]He has nothing, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:33.52]A little toasty toasty.
[40:35.94]I'm not in the mood to sing to you folks.
[40:38.21]I had a very depressing, the worst possible situation in my life, which could have happened in my absence while I was gone.
[40:44.92]I came back, well, at the beginning of the story.
[40:48.61]I thought today, I've been here doing this all day, I thought I'd go get myself a nice cheeseburger.
[40:53.41]It's raining outside.
[40:54.71]I walked in the rain to you, burger.
[40:56.84]Yes, melee, you're on point with this.
[40:58.27]You've got stones, I'll give you that.
[41:00.27]Damn.
[41:03.36]I spent 20 minutes looking for my keys.
[41:06.10]It was very dramatic.
[41:07.04]I finally found it in my cupboard.
[41:09.00]I don't know why it's in there.
[41:10.22]In between plates.
[41:11.18]I remembered I did that.
[41:12.77]I don't know why I did, though.
[41:14.45]I finally walk through the rain and get there, and I order my hamburger, and I, in the process of looking for my keys, took my wallet out of my pocket and left it at home.
[41:28.71]I come back.
[41:29.67]Now, that's not the saddest part of the story.
[41:31.05]The saddest part is I come back after all of that, and Jerma is singing.
[41:35.54]That should be like a mood booster, in my opinion.
[41:41.58]Really?
[41:42.13]Yeah, what's wrong with Jerma singing?
[41:44.27]I think he would just jelly of his singing.
[41:47.18]That's what it was that was he realized how good it was and how he can never gold to try to be that good I thought the story was gonna go to I ordered my hamburger and the person who took my order said no only if you sing the crate song We are eighteen dollars away, and I don't think we can get there without the crate song um Ladies and gentlemen this is
[42:10.49]That is unbelievably not the worst sad story I've heard.
[42:14.05]There's a legit, like, crate unboxing happening tomorrow.
[42:18.00]Like, you want to break out the crate song now?
[42:20.28]Like, you're irresponsible with your thing.
[42:22.76]You guys should all be ashamed.
[42:25.15]Can you only sing the song once a weekend?
[42:29.59]Like, once a lifetime it happens.
[42:33.32]Is it on a YouTube video somewhere?
[42:34.96]It is.
[42:35.60]It's called DJ Ster.
[42:38.93]Oh, God.
[42:43.34]I'm not buying this story.
[42:44.37]I don't know.
[42:46.01]Still, no stones.
[42:47.39]That's all I gotta say.
[42:48.03]Hashtag no stones.
[42:50.79]Dang.
[42:50.91]He's harsh.
[42:52.42]Sorry, Star.
[42:53.16]Hey, I just met you.
[42:54.06]This is crazy, but you have no balls, so don't call me maybe?
[42:58.97]Can you be roasted and blended?
[43:00.33]You can be... It's for the kids!
[43:02.89]You can be roasted, toasted, and blended.
[43:05.42]For the kids.
[43:07.10]$50 donation from ChimpChimp.
[43:09.48]No comment.
[43:10.73]Thank you for the $50, Patrick.
[43:12.25]We really appreciate it, buddy.
[43:14.60]$30 from DerpDerp101, who is wondering if Harbaloo is coming to teach us Geely Wash rollouts.
[43:21.67]Negative.
[43:24.32]But Star will be singing in a little bit.
[43:26.86]Well, I do want to take advantage of the fact that we have Tag here, who has not been with us all day.
[43:31.88]So, Tag... Hi.
[43:33.88]Hi.
[43:34.42]Hi.
[43:35.36]Who'd you see in the bus today?
[43:36.57]Oh, you didn't see anyone in the bus today.
[43:38.07]I didn't see anyone in the bus today, yeah.
[43:41.48]Oh.
[43:41.62]Wait, okay, I'll think of a funny bus story.
[43:44.79]Alright, well, I'll tell my tag story.
[43:47.41]Once, Tag and I met in Chicago with a bunch of other TF2 people, and we had deep dish pizza together, and it was, dare I say, magical tag?
[43:54.18]That is a metaphor for something.
[43:56.19]That was not a metaphor.
[43:57.55]It was literally deep dish pizza.
[44:00.30]It was literally deep dish pizza.
[44:01.74]And it was literally the second best pizza I've ever had.
[44:05.27]It was literally, uh... I'm sorry, but St.
[44:08.30]Louis Pizza has Chicago-style pizza any day.
[44:10.60]Yes, I will say it.
[44:12.04]Chat, if you want to go, let's fight.
[44:13.81]We'll chat.
[44:15.03]New York?
[44:15.59]No, no.
[44:16.39]Sit down, sit down.
[44:17.53]Hold on, hold on.
[44:18.17]Apparently, there is a silent auction that's going on right now.
[44:20.48]I think it's Jerma's auction, I was told, to plug this at something.
[44:24.52]Who is that?
[44:25.62]I was told before, I guess the silent auction is something that's continuing, so it's not ending now.
[44:30.85]But since we've gone towards this, we've trended silly, for good reason.
[44:35.44]If you guys want to get involved in the silent auction, I'm not sure what the prices are.
[44:39.01]Maybe we can have an update on where things stand.
[44:41.93]See if you can pry Star's sniper rifle out of his...
[44:45.86]non-singing hands he really wants it bidding up to like three hundred dollars for star sniper rifle which is pretty awesome um it's golden too it's golden and okay so I'm wrong bidding doesn't deserve it bidding closes at 11 p.m eastern you've pushed me too far is that being just like for us or is that being you're gonna go on like some sort of spring are you singing Lincoln park songs that was so loud
[45:12.92]What?
[45:13.44]It was so loud it didn't work.
[45:14.83]Did he just explode?
[45:16.95]He turned into a sun cloud.
[45:19.07]He was roasting, he roasted himself.
[45:21.32]Who's gonna take over the Star's channel now?
[45:23.70]He was warning us about his speed.
[45:25.82]I-I drove him to this, I will take care of this.
[45:29.09]Star, are you okay?
[45:30.59]I'm fine.
[45:31.05]Put him down.
[45:31.51]Put him down, Lassie.
[45:36.04]I'm doing great.
[45:38.14]I just want to point out, by the way, that Star's donated probably as much as anybody who's not currently enjoying too much of a specific thing.
[45:47.11]So I'm going to let Star off the hook.
[45:50.37]No, we're just giving you a hard time because you're such a generous member of the TF2 community.
[45:55.90]You pushed me to this.
[45:58.02]Oh, no.
[45:58.58]Oh, no.
[46:00.72]I think he's doing something.
[46:02.36]He's planning something.
[46:04.29]I'm a little scared.
[46:05.23]He's a conniving little sneak.
[46:06.73]Who said that?
[46:09.08]Should we go back to tag stories on the subway or in the bus?
[46:13.67]Oh, wow, someone... Okay, well, um... Uh... Wait.
[46:19.28]Dude might use her.
[46:23.87]Okay.
[46:24.27]We have a $500 donation from El Grifo.
[46:32.12]No comments.
[46:33.15]I feel like if you're going to donate $500, you should make me say something stupid.
[46:37.65]But you said nothing, and you're a very generous person, Jason, and we thank you so much.
[46:41.58]$500 is amazing.
[46:43.32]And I also have $200 from the Dapper Duck.
[46:50.25]You guys, hey guys, you are doing amazing stuff for an amazing cause.
[46:53.50]Jerma and Star make my day every video.
[46:56.18]This money goes to Jerma and Star telling some stories.
[46:59.21]Keep doing what you're doing.
[46:59.99]Love from...
[47:02.90]Australia again?
[47:07.71]Oh my goodness.
[47:10.49]How does he know the exact conversion rate for 200?
[47:13.30]It'd be funny if he thought he was donating like 10.
[47:16.86]It's like, oh god!
[47:19.96]only wanted to go that's just awesome to see in the entire worldwide community for we had some donations from like Taiwan and if we have some from South America and of course America and then Australia and Europe just spanning the globe attitude to community really coming together to show what it's all about right here and it is fast right for the kids uh... if you guys are just train as it's for one step camp sent into the district in patients uh... kids to summer camp so they can enjoy being
[47:47.67]We have about 10 minutes left here before we go to the event of the night, which is surfing.
[47:54.13]So before we go there, let's try to get back up to we have $1,000 more.
[47:58.16]I say we can totally do that in an hour.
[47:59.88]I mean 10 minutes.
[48:02.97]Alright, Kip, calm down.
[48:04.34]Let's not get crazy now, okay?
[48:06.32]Let's not order a deep dish pizza, okay?
[48:08.97]Oh, see, the thing I disagree with about deep dish pizza is it's a casserole, not a pizza.
[48:14.02]And I will go to my grave saying that.
[48:15.84]I'm sorry, Tex.
[48:18.67]It's fine.
[48:19.31]We'll just never meet again.
[48:21.54]By the way, chat, why you guys are gonna spam and just get mowed down?
[48:26.59]Oh my goodness, Nightbot came to play, boys and girls.
[48:30.41]So, as Seanbutt just said in chat, do not post any more of the nonsense on spammy.
[48:36.19]If Star wants to do the thing, he's not even here anymore.
[48:43.12]That's my bad.
[48:44.88]That's my bad.
[48:45.98]That's my bad.
[48:47.32]That's my bad.
[48:48.26]That's my bad.
[48:49.17]That's my bad.
[48:50.37]That's my bad.
[48:51.67]That's my bad.
[48:54.41]That's my bad.
[48:55.01]That's my bad.
[48:56.23]That's my bad.
[48:57.58]That's my bad.
[48:58.56]That's my bad.
[49:00.04]That's my bad.
[49:00.90]That's my bad.
[49:01.40]That's my bad.

[49:05.12]That's my bad.
[49:06.69]That's my bad.
[49:07.29]That's my bad.
[49:09.33]That's my bad.
[49:11.07]That's my bad.
[49:12.87]Yeah, let's see if we can get to 49 by the end of this little pub session here.
[49:19.60]I asked you to put me in code, you said no.
[49:23.02]What the- I- I'm not gonna start this on stream.
[49:26.99]I'm not gonna let the public know about this, but that's bullshit.
[49:33.72]I said we get a regional food war going on here.
[49:36.92]We got Chicago Deep Dish Pizza versus Jerma, what's your favorite regional food?
[49:42.27]Butts.
[49:45.72]Butts?
[49:47.30]No.
[49:48.25]My favorite region of food is bums.
[49:49.79]No, my favorite region... Buffalo chicken.
[49:53.72]Alright, alright.
[49:54.46]I'm gonna throw this out there.
[49:55.19]Unfortunately, I can't really eat it anymore, but I still love it.
[49:57.99]What?
[49:58.37]It sounds like a personal problem.
[50:01.10]Yeah, it is.
[50:02.08]I'm gonna throw this out there.
[50:03.32]Toasted ravioli, which is a St.
[50:04.98]Louis original and is absolutely amazing.
[50:07.53]Anybody else have a regional food they want to take up against toasted ravioli, which, as far as I know, wins?
[50:12.12]Yes, I do.
[50:13.16]My mother's homemade chicken pot pie.
[50:15.42]What?
[50:15.56]It's not regional.
[50:16.04]It's just your mom.
[50:17.31]It's regional to me.
[50:19.32]Invite us to your mom's house.
[50:20.53]You know what they got in beautiful Buffalo?
[50:22.81]They got chicken wings and they got beef on weck.
[50:25.65]So I'm gonna stick to my beef on weck guns.
[50:28.50]Beef on what?
[50:29.20]On weck.
[50:30.04]Weck?
[50:30.92]What is weck?
[50:32.18]Does anyone know what weck is?
[50:34.16]I'm in the weck.
[50:35.22]Hold on, we just got some monies in.
[50:37.99]We have a $95 donation from someone.
[50:40.79]That's your alias?
