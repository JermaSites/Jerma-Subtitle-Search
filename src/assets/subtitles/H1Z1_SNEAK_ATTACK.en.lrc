[00:05.08]Did I just hear a boat?
[00:08.62]I did?
[00:09.02]That guy just fell over.
[00:11.03]That better not be my friend that I made at the gas station.
[00:14.11]Who's this guy?
[00:15.47]Joyce?
[00:15.81]That's my friend you just killed?
[00:20.05]You have to atone for your sins.
[00:23.06]You think I didn't see what you just did?
[00:25.08]You think I didn't see you just snipe cart raw there?
[00:28.84]He waved at me, and I waved back.
[00:31.42]You don't break that kind of bond.
[00:33.70]It's unbreakable.
[00:34.36]I'm just gonna have to take this backpack.
[00:37.46]Go take your hat.
[00:39.12]Pave it.
[00:41.08]Hey!
[00:41.80]Whoo!
[00:44.82]How are you right next to me?
[00:47.05]I'm right behind you.
[00:49.47]I heard you talking.
[00:51.55]Dude, you're invisible.
[00:52.55]You did not just get punched.
[00:53.45]You're telling me you just did not get punched.
[00:55.17]That is correct.
[00:57.40]Ow.
[00:58.08]Okay, I did that time.
[01:00.28]Okay, because I'm standing right in front of you right now.
[01:02.96]I definitely can't see you.
[01:05.16]Not even a little bit.
[01:09.92]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[01:13.60]Can I please just see your car?
[01:15.94]I wanna see it, too.
[01:17.98]Let me see it.
[01:19.18]How do I get in?
[01:20.38]There, I put my hands up so you don't shoot me.
[01:21.83]I got in!
[01:22.61]Let's go!
[01:23.17]So, uh... What do you guys... What do you guys like to do for fun?
[01:28.49]Alright, here they are.
[01:29.43]Watch out!
[01:29.85]Watch out for these criminals!
[01:31.47]You just, like, warned them.
[01:35.22]You just, like, told them to watch out.
[01:36.96]Where are the police?
[01:38.90]The police have been thwarted by the Archer Bandits once again.
[01:43.07]Put your hands in the air, you bastards.
[01:46.27]So I might know where another car is.
[01:47.65]Alright, get in the back.
[01:51.53]Yeah, here you go.
[01:53.63]Yeah.
[01:55.35]We did it.
[01:55.77]What is your guy doing?
[01:57.82]I'm kneeling in the back and shaking.
[02:01.16]I can't see anything in front, by the way.
[02:03.10]I can only see things behind me.
[02:04.60]There's another car.
[02:07.10]Enemy car, enemy vehicle.
[02:10.68]That guy's got a gun.
[02:12.63]We got the same car too.
[02:14.01]Yeah, the front passenger had a shotgun.
[02:16.88]Oh no!
[02:17.26]Oh no!
[02:31.02]Oh no.
[02:32.02]The inevitable conclusion.
[02:34.04]Yeah.
[02:34.48]Make sure I'm like behind him.
[02:37.26]See?
[02:37.74]Got flashlights out.
[02:39.14]I surrender to you, Chuckle.
[02:43.15]Keep him busy.
[02:43.71]Keep him talking.
[02:44.77]Here he comes.
[02:47.33]Surprise, Chuckle.
[02:48.35]Surprise.
[02:48.85]Watch out, Chuckle.
[02:52.95]Everybody scatter.
[02:54.15]I'm a stick bandit.
[02:55.45]Come here.
[02:56.03]You think you're going to get away from a stick bandit?
[02:57.53]Chuckle, is this guy with you?
[02:58.41]Hold on.
[03:01.79]I'm going to punch you in the face.
[03:03.99]To prove, Chuckle, I'm on his team.
[03:06.49]Watch out, Jeremy.
[03:07.17]He's going to shoot you in the face.
[03:08.54]How dare you shoot the stick bandit?
[03:11.60]He just killed you.
[03:14.22]Yeah, screw that guy.
[03:15.54]Good job, Chuckle.
[03:25.40]Why did you do this?
[03:27.78]Chuckle.
[03:29.20]Chuckle.
[03:30.76]It wasn't meant to be this way.
[03:32.10]You know, I don't even feel an ounce of remorse.
[03:37.87]Can you just, see that like hill up there?
[03:40.75]Yeah.
[03:41.41]Think you can hit that jump?
[03:42.35]You think you can go over?
[03:43.25]You want me to Dukes of Hazzard it?
[03:44.31]Let's go.
[03:45.12]You think you can Dukes of Hazzard this?
[03:47.56]Hell yeah.
[03:47.88]I don't know if he can.
[03:49.50]I don't know, it's debatable.
[03:51.02]I've seen both the TV show and the movie, and I'm not entirely sure.
[03:56.65]Oh my god!
[03:57.65]We made it!
[03:58.79]We made it!
[03:59.37]How?
[04:00.93]You're a god behind the wheel.
[04:04.52]Thank you.
[04:05.48]That bear is threatening me.
[04:08.16]Yeah, we shouldn't go near him.
[04:10.30]We should run it over.
[04:14.37]He's very impressionable.
[04:17.09]Toro.
[04:18.05]Toro, says the bear.
[04:19.39]He's galloping after us very fast.
[04:23.20]He's so fast.
[04:24.90]Is he really that fast?
[04:27.06]Oh, damn.
[04:29.18]Oh, what?
[04:30.90]Did I kill it?
[04:32.46]I don't think so.
[04:33.13]He's just kind of standing there.
[04:35.66]Here it comes.
[04:40.16]These bears don't make any sense.
[04:41.94]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:42.40]Get him on top of the car.
[04:45.68]Get him on top of the car.
[04:48.99]Yeah, get him on top of the car.
[04:50.47]Whoa, whoa.
[04:50.99]Can he hurt us from in there?
[04:52.41]What?
[04:53.27]I don't think so.
[04:54.95]We got to get him on top of the car.
[04:56.57]That's like that's absolutely has to try Are you bleeding are you okay?
[05:11.55]I'm not bleeding, but I just dropped half my health After you guys
[05:22.13]Are you dead, Jerma?
[05:23.21]He killed me!
[05:24.13]The bear killed me!
[05:29.84]The bear just did like a drive-by swipe!
[05:33.88]He just ran past and killed the driver on the way through.
[05:38.46]I might have a car.
[05:40.28]I think I have a car.
[05:42.34]Are we gonna make out with a car?
[05:44.60]We just made out with a car.
[05:45.88]Holy shit, we made out with a car after that.
[05:47.98]We finally have a car.
[05:49.44]I have a car!
[05:51.54]Are you on a bridge?
[05:52.24]Is this you on a bridge?
[05:53.91]No.
[05:54.09]Hit me, hit me, hit me!
[05:56.17]The guy was just like, hit me, hit me!
[06:03.43]Oh my god.
[06:03.95]I'm gonna get attacked.
[06:06.35]Citizen?
[06:07.84]Do not resist!
[06:10.32]I... what do I do?
[06:12.26]Quick, there's another guy charging me!
[06:13.76]Oh shit!
[06:14.36]Oh shit.
[06:16.08]Go!
[06:16.50]Go!
[06:17.44]Coming through.
[06:19.78]Zombie!
[06:20.44]Cease and desist!
[06:29.10]There he is.
[06:29.90]There's two guys up ahead.
[06:31.64]Oh, Jesus.
[06:32.52]Oh, God.
[06:33.71]Oh, my God.
[06:34.85]Alright, let's go help him.
[06:39.17]He said, ah, he's chasing me.
[06:43.55]We've got a red alert!
[06:45.97]Some guy's getting chased!
[06:50.82]But who's chasing who?
[06:56.62]I got him!
[06:57.90]I got your chaser!
[07:00.16]You're welcome, citizen!
[07:01.09]He's shooting you with a bow.
[07:03.67]He's shooting a bow at us now.
[07:05.05]So, I think what happened there is both those guys were actually friends, just joking like, oh, he's chasing me.
[07:11.65]And I took it upon myself to turn around and run his friend over.
[07:15.89]Take us to the top of the mountain.
[07:17.55]Yeah, this is totally normal.
[07:20.78]Yeah, it's just totally normal.
[07:23.12]This is a road.
[07:23.92]I mean, this is not like a mouthpiece or anything.
[07:27.52]It's just a road.
[07:29.62]I hope you survive this zombie apocalypse.
[07:33.33]Yeah, this is pretty good.
[07:35.69]Hey, did I... How are we still... We did it.
[07:52.69]Thank you.
