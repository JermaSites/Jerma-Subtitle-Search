[00:39.82]Hi guys.
[00:42.06]Starting soon.
[00:43.90]I'm going to grab a drink and we'll get going.
[00:46.67]Give me one second.
[04:26.25]Okay.
[04:28.25]Cool.
[04:31.23]I think we're ready to get going.
[04:36.66]Close up some windows.
[04:38.98]Let me bar my windows real quick.
[04:42.49]Get my dog in here.
[04:43.39]Hey, dog.
[05:00.41]He's doing the thing where he's... When a dog doesn't want to do something, and they roll on their back and they shake their hands at you.
[05:07.05]Come on.
[05:10.45]He's like, I'm not leaving from this spot.
[05:12.29]Well, fine.
[05:15.59]Let's move over to sorcery.
[05:18.42]So, if you remember last night, we had a little interruption.
[05:24.40]My internet died for some reason.
[05:25.90]I don't know why.
[05:27.32]But it did.
[05:27.74]And we were in the middle of talking to this old guy out here.
[05:32.47]And we got attacked by these, like, banshees.
[05:39.91]My dog just stares at me.
[05:42.77]Yeah, this is the last where we were.
[05:45.50]I stepped in front of the old guy to protect him.
[05:50.34]So I'm just going to give it a couple seconds so people can trickle in because this might be like an important scene.
[05:59.09]Am I?
[06:00.87]Twitch alerts set up, I think so.
[06:04.49]Thank you, underappreciated, for your subscription.
[06:07.27]Also to XXXPhoenix and to Daisies13 and to xOllieX.
[06:14.16]A lot of subscribers when I wasn't online.
[06:17.89]WiffleSniffer from an hour ago, thank you.
[06:19.73]Kataroni!
[06:21.89]Narku!
[06:23.05]Griffer!
[06:24.53]Thanks for your subscriptions.
[06:26.21]I hope he birthed.
[06:30.35]Thank you, Saika.
[06:32.91]Yeah, this is a very important zap scene, by the way.
[06:37.30]So what is this whole thing with Twitch Prime?
[06:39.48]I'm seeing a bunch of Twitch Prime subscriptions.
[06:43.89]Subscribe to Twitch Prime.
[06:44.71]Twitch Prime.
[06:45.05]Oh, my God.
[06:47.55]Like, what does this do?
[06:50.72]Oh, boy.
[06:53.58]Challenge you to swindle stones.
[06:55.98]Thanks, Law Bears.
[06:57.38]For a thousand bits.
[06:58.14]Appreciate it, dude.
[06:59.00]And to never trust a purple for a hundred bits.
[07:07.47]Thanks, Gothaholic.
[07:12.67]Alright, let's just get going.
[07:15.39]They super subscribed.
[07:18.14]Amazon Prime now gives Twitch stuff.
[07:19.86]Oh, that's awesome.
[07:21.56]I have Amazon Prime.
[07:22.52]Do you get like extra subs?
[07:27.38]Get a free sub with Twitch.
[07:28.53]Oh, that's pretty sweet.
[07:31.37]That is very sweet.
[07:37.75]Alright, so...
[07:41.82]More people just kind of came in.
[07:43.04]I will explain what's going on on the screen if you see the giant alien creature.
[07:49.66]We got attacked.
[07:50.78]We were talking to this guy.
[07:51.78]He's blind, I believe.
[07:54.99]And I stepped in front.
[07:56.93]I pulled my sword out.
[07:58.55]But this is a pretty good opportunity.
[07:59.77]I mean, I titled this stream.
[08:03.13]Oh, it was zapped for a little while.
[08:08.98]Oh wow, everyone in Germany just subscribed to me.
[08:12.18]Wow, that's like 600 million dollars a day.
[08:15.60]Thanks.
[08:16.82]Or whatever it is.
[08:17.93]Well, thanks for like the five dollars per... How many people live in Germany?
[08:20.71]Oh, like a couple... Like a hundred million?
[08:23.19]A couple hundred million?
[08:24.45]I don't know.
[08:26.99]But let's do our, you know, it's an inaugural stream here on Friday night.
[08:32.90]Start it off with a zap, baby.
[08:36.43]No, I can't do zap.
[08:37.86]I can do hot.
[08:38.98]I remember that.
[08:40.56]I'm gonna cast a fireball.
[08:43.62]Fireball.
[08:45.66]You cast a spell winding a fireball in your palm.
[08:48.80]The beggar stumbles backwards overawed by your power in the heat of your flame.
[08:53.69]Then you toss it up at the harpy.
[08:56.31]Oh no.
[08:58.55]Does it hit?
[09:00.03]The fireball connects!
[09:01.11]The creature wheels and flaps in the sky trying to put out the burning in its wing.
[09:04.68]Then it turns about screaming downwards for your blood.
[09:10.18]Great.
[09:10.64]I traded three stamina for three stamina.
[09:14.28]But we're gonna go full blast a ten and insta-kill him.
[09:17.27]No we're not.
[09:19.63]What?
[09:22.43]Why did that not hurt him?
[09:25.35]Harvey flies upwards out of reach of your blade.
[09:29.91]Oh my god, he flew away?
[09:32.15]That's great.
[09:37.41]I forgot he's in the air.
[09:38.27]Let's do it again.
[09:40.11]Let's go with like 5.4.
[09:41.09]Oh my goodness.
[09:44.15]No!
[09:44.61]4.3.
[09:47.37]Oh my god, we're gonna die to the harpy.
[09:49.67]We're dead.
[09:53.29]Yeah, we're dead.
[09:54.05]I have to kill him right now.
[09:54.81]Wait, what?
[09:56.32]Oh, what?
[09:56.88]Only one damage?
[09:57.60]Are you fucking kidding me?
[10:00.29]I got to do it again.
[10:01.93]Oh, wow.
[10:02.51]So lucky.
[10:03.69]So lucky.
[10:05.59]One HP.
[10:09.43]Did it with one HP.
[10:12.91]Thanks a lot, Kuzin.
[10:13.77]Thanks a lot, CoreMonster.
[10:15.71]And for real though.
[10:18.28]No rewinds.
[10:20.20]We just protected him.
[10:21.02]I just protected that old guy.
[10:22.68]One HP.
[10:23.88]There's another one.
[10:25.30]There's another one.
[10:27.89]There is more than one of these guys.
[10:29.76]Apparently, there's more than one.
[10:33.94]We're dead.
[10:34.76]Let's go with a medium swing.
[10:41.33]We're dead.
[10:46.31]Okay.
[10:48.77]Well, goodbye.
[10:49.72]Goodbye, I died.
[10:50.42]Is that six?
[10:55.32]Wait, what?
[10:57.04]It's putting me at the second one.
[11:04.86]Corvadex, did I mix it?
[11:06.22]Corvadox.
[11:06.98]Sorry, I missed your sub, dude.
[11:08.06]Welcome, thanks.
[11:08.72]Thank you.
[11:09.86]Yeah, if you sub with the Twitch one, the Amazon Prime one, I don't see it coming up on my dashboard.
[11:17.91]Well, I think we can pray, right?
[11:19.75]Pray to the elephant.
[11:20.67]No, he won't hear us.
[11:23.05]Do I have anything?
[11:26.12]Oh, I've got one blimbleberry juice.
[11:31.96]I can't believe the fireball didn't just kill the first one.
[11:33.82]And this one now, I get it.
[11:37.37]I get it.
[11:38.77]Need an epic play here.
[11:39.79]Well, I'm going to go with like 6.
[11:40.89]Point.
[11:42.17]No, I'm going 7.0.
[11:43.03]7 is straight up 7.
[11:44.37]Got him.
[11:44.57]How many deaths is that?
[11:55.61]Is that five deaths or six deaths?
[11:56.85]I don't know.
[11:57.43]Somebody keep track.
[12:00.71]I'm gonna go with a defense right here.
[12:02.71]Okay, so did he.
[12:03.37]Good.
[12:03.73]He was gonna fly away.
[12:05.47]Okay.
[12:08.21]I don't know.
[12:08.85]He might come at me with like a nine.
[12:11.94]I'm gonna defend again.
[12:14.62]He did like a little fucking scritchy scratch on me.
[12:17.02]Fine, that's good.
[12:18.86]I'm gonna go with eight.
[12:20.90]8.0.
[12:20.94]Ooh, got him.
[12:23.20]Dead.
[12:25.91]You pause, watching for the harpy's wings to open, then you strike.
[12:29.09]You slice with your sword.
[12:30.61]With a final turn through the air, the harpy barrels over, then tumbles, striking the side of the church.
[12:35.97]That was like such a weak little hit.
[12:38.21]As it hits the ground, a wall collapses and the creature is buried beneath the slide of masonry.
[12:43.49]The beggar cheers and begins to dance.
[12:47.06]Did it.
[12:49.08]The beggar creeps up from his hiding place and thanks you two or three times over.
[12:53.72]Alright.
[12:54.54]Cool.
[12:56.76]Who are you?
[12:58.40]Tell me truthfully.
[12:59.54]Who are you, you demand?
[13:00.98]Why are those harpies after you?
[13:02.90]The beggar looks at you thinking hard, then shakes his head.
[13:06.76]If you do not know my name already, then it is best forgotten.
[13:13.17]Shit, he's one of the nobles.
[13:14.35]Yeah, he's one of the nobles.
[13:22.74]Zap his ass.
[13:27.70]Oh, what is that?
[13:29.10]Don't even tell me.
[13:29.94]No.
[13:30.46]I thought I could shoot a fireball at him.
[13:34.97]Read his mind?
[13:35.41]I think we can read his mind here.
[13:40.71]I have a job interview tomorrow, so celebrate, here's some money.
[13:43.63]Oh, jeez.
[13:44.01]Well, thanks, Snapfreeze.
[13:46.42]Thanks, SketchyDragon, as well, for the eight months.
[13:49.12]And a bunch of other bits came in, too, and some resubs.
[13:51.70]Thank you, TastyCakes, for your four months.
[13:54.20]Thank you, ChronicWaffle, Kuzan, CoreMonster.
[13:59.04]I never trust purple.
[14:01.88]Uh, he could just lie in his head.
[14:03.29]All these nobles seem to be really smart, so... I'm not gonna sense danger.
[14:07.91]He's an old man.
[14:08.55]He's not gonna do anything.
[14:11.91]Dud?
[14:12.70]Illusion of treasure?
[14:14.40]Hey, look, there's treasure over there.
[14:15.76]What's your name again?
[14:16.48]You have a good luck on that interview, dude.
[14:20.12]You got some people in the chat kind of encouraging you.
[14:23.88]Hope you get it.
[14:26.83]I'm going to read his mind.
[14:28.39]I feel like that's the best course of action here.
[14:32.67]Let's see.
[14:33.65]You put the skullcap on your head and cast the spell, then you reach into the beggar's mind and pluck his name like a flower from a garden.
[14:40.17]He is Theta, seventh noble of Kare.
[14:43.81]Haha, you are Theta.
[14:46.00]He tries to deny it, but his pause is too long to be believed.
[14:49.28]Finally, he sighs.
[14:50.98]I am, or I was, before I was destroyed.
[14:55.72]Got it.
[14:57.10]Talk to him.
[14:58.59]Lord Theta, I'd like to talk to you.
[15:00.57]He sighs.
[15:01.49]That's my name.
[15:02.27]I don't deny it.
[15:03.51]I'll talk to you.
[15:04.89]I'll talk to you happily.
[15:06.51]Ever since the blindness struck me down, I've been tormented by those demons, and now they are dead.
[15:11.57]You've saved me, or as much as I can be saved.
[15:16.81]Tell me your spell line for the gate.
[15:21.31]What's the spell for the gate?
[15:26.60]Tell me your spell line, please.
[15:28.50]Happily, he says.
[15:29.72]I'm glad to be rid of it.
[15:31.10]It was... Oh, no.
[15:33.42]My memory's not as good as it was.
[15:34.98]Let me see.
[15:35.62]It was... He racks his brains thinking for all he is worth.
[15:39.42]Hit him.
[15:43.45]That's so terrible.
[15:45.85]Destroy him.
[15:47.69]Thank you, Gawky Hades.
[15:49.69]And Mayher... That's so terrible.
[15:53.75]He's like trying to think and I just like hit him right in the stomach.
[15:59.39]Zap.
[16:01.48]How much gold do I have?
[16:08.69]I need to get this line.
[16:09.63]This is important.
[16:12.19]I'm going to give him a second, okay?
[16:15.43]You wait patiently for him to remember.
[16:17.95]Got it, he exclaims.
[16:19.43]It's by Corga's Grace and something's pride.
[16:23.29]Oh, but I can't remember what the something was.
[16:25.64]The beggar shivers against the sudden breath of cold.
[16:27.74]The afternoon is waning.
[16:28.92]Evening is approaching already.
[16:31.02]Days are growing shorter.
[16:32.98]It's like that here, near the backlands.
[16:35.78]Always like that here.
[16:38.35]Try to fucking remember the rest of the line.
[16:40.47]Because I need it.
[16:43.57]He shakes his head.
[16:44.69]It's God, I fear.
[16:45.99]It's God, like my sight.
[16:47.86]It was the name of a god.
[16:49.40]One of the old gods.
[16:50.50]The god of pride, no less.
[16:52.38]Maybe you can find out elsewhere.
[16:54.18]You could ask Kurga, the god of Grace, for his help.
[16:57.00]The god lives in a temple that way.
[16:59.10]He waves roughly northwards.
[17:00.86]The beggar makes a coughing sound.
[17:03.10]I'm starving.
[17:04.40]So hungry.
[17:05.48]But you have no food.
[17:07.30]You could offer me.
[17:08.16]Oh, goodness.
[17:08.73]How did I know that?
[17:09.53]I can't look in your package.
[17:11.23]Tell me about Corga.
[17:13.87]How can he help me?
[17:15.65]Corga sees all and knows all.
[17:18.09]Suddenly, the beggar grips your wrist and squeezes.
[17:20.19]But you risk your life if you talk to him.
[17:22.23]Remember, please, the left eye.
[17:25.38]That's how you start.
[17:26.60]The left eye.
[17:28.58]This guy knows what he's talking about.
[17:32.01]What happened to your eyes?
[17:32.85]Why are you so weird?
[17:34.71]You take a moment to show you some sympathy.
[17:36.07]What happened to your eyes?
[17:37.63]A black-eyed curse.
[17:39.23]And I know who cursed me.
[17:40.47]It was Sansus.
[17:41.67]Once a good ruler, fair and honest.
[17:43.90]He ruled Kare like a kind father looking after a cherished daughter.
[17:47.46]Nothing was too much effort for him, but he began to fear his other counselors.
[17:51.66]He thought we were plotting against him, ready to overthrow him.
[17:57.04]Zap the left eye.
[17:58.54]Oh, were you?
[17:59.60]Were you going to overthrow the guy?
[18:01.58]The beggar laughed sadly.
[18:04.02]Mulas was.
[18:05.46]As soon as Santus gave Mulas one of the spell lines, he wanted them all.
[18:09.45]He wanted them for himself so he could hold the city to ransom.
[18:12.89]Mulas used to be a blackmailer.
[18:16.67]But I was loyal, and Santus repaid me.
[18:20.34]Like this, he begins to weep once more.
[18:24.50]See you later.
[18:26.18]Thanks for the spell line.
[18:34.73]You curse the beggar for his useless half-help.
[18:37.77]Then you look to the track ahead and take your leave of him.
[18:40.55]You follow the path around the edge of the wasteland.
[18:42.99]Two new clues.
[18:45.59]Let's see.
[18:48.73]Seventh Noble Theta.
[18:49.51]There he is.
[18:51.99]Seventh Noble.
[18:54.00]Half of Theda's spell line.
[18:55.90]By Cougar's Grace and someone's pride.
[18:58.98]That's half the line, I guess.
[19:02.70]I completely forgot how hard it was to get all these lines.
[19:08.94]But thank you, SmithSmith, for your subscription.
[19:12.69]Wizard, FoxyFury, and Mayher.
[19:16.21]Thank you.
[19:16.61]Let's go to the edge of the wasteland.
[19:23.29]Yeah, screw you for giving me all these lines and clues.
[19:26.74]After a while, another path joins this one.
[19:29.04]Looking back along, you see a broken fountain.
[19:31.40]A track climbs the rise at your back towards a low hovel.
[19:35.02]This is the far edge of the wasteland.
[19:37.06]Ahead, you make out a line of tall, dark trees.
[19:41.91]Huh.
[19:43.43]Fountain, hovel, or fence?
[19:50.03]Well, that brings me to the necropolis.
[19:57.44]Let's go to the hovel.
[19:58.44]It's right here.
[20:01.22]You climb the rise towards the hovel.
[20:03.14]It is merely a tent pitched in a clearing, guy ropes held down by rubble.
[20:09.76]I love how that's always an option.
[20:11.16]Listen at the door.
[20:13.42]I think I'm getting sick.
[20:15.93]Listen at the door is always something you can do.
[20:22.83]You can always just put your face and ears up to the door and be like, what's in there?
[20:26.33]Who's talking?
[20:28.13]I feel like one of these times I'm going to do that.
[20:29.79]Someone's going to open up the door and hit me right in the face.
[20:32.99]You stand and hold your breath, but you hear nothing from inside.
[20:36.02]Perhaps it is unoccupied.
[20:37.62]Certainly, it can't contain much.
[20:41.38]Go in.
[20:43.74]Oh, boy.
[20:47.48]Who is this person?
[20:49.40]Too much thinking, not enough zapping.
[20:54.20]You step into the shade of the tiny hovel, and your eyes widen.
[20:57.64]The room inside is lined, floor to ceiling, with trinkets.
[21:00.44]Wait, what?
[21:01.84]I'm telling you, trinkets, knickknacks, brick-a-brack, brick-a-brack, and other miscellaneous stuff.
[21:08.37]Some is piled up on the shelf, some hangs from the ceiling, even more leans against the walls.
[21:13.43]There are weapons, pottery, jewelry, domestic objects, magical items, and so on.
[21:18.71]Guy has a ton of stuff.
[21:23.14]I keep thinking of that kid smacking his face on the table.
[21:27.83]From Layers of Fear.
[21:28.59]Oh yeah, that was ridiculous.
[21:30.81]Alright, so this is like a little shop, I think.
[21:33.27]Sitting cross-legged on the floor in the midst of all this mess is a small bearded gnome who rubs his hands and greets you as you come in.
[21:41.06]Greetings, gnome.
[21:42.34]I have come to rob you.
[21:43.48]Hey, did you say stuff?
[21:47.74]Let's greet him.
[21:49.16]Greetings, Gnome.
[21:50.56]Greetings, the gnome answers enthusiastically.
[21:52.76]He pats the ground beside him.
[21:54.46]Let's see if we can do a little bartering.
[21:56.95]As you can probably tell, I have no interest in money.
[22:00.35]The gnome gestures around his little room.
[22:02.47]There is clearly a lot to choose from, but the items which stand out are a bamboo flute, a pot of beeswax, a bag of goblin's teeth, and a compass, whose needle quivers in a direction which is close to but not actually north.
[22:15.94]What would you like?
[22:17.02]the gnome asks.
[22:19.77]These are all for spell ingredients.
[22:23.33]So... There's beeswax.
[22:25.49]It sharpens your blade, I believe.
[22:27.37]The goblin's teeth.
[22:28.19]You can summon goblins.
[22:30.71]I don't really know what the compass does, and I don't know what the flute does.
[22:36.17]Oh, I think you can make people dance, right?
[22:38.49]You can make people kind of... The piccolo of the flaming fire, right?
[22:42.94]It's like Warcraft.
[22:47.08]Hmm...
[22:49.54]I kind of like the idea of summoning goblins.
[22:51.16]What do you guys think?
[22:57.24]We're gonna have to do a poll.
[22:58.96]First poll of the night.
[23:02.04]Because all these are useful in some way or another.
[23:06.62]So let's do a poll.
[23:10.38]Poll time.
[23:13.40]Which item?
[23:17.80]Beeswax?
[23:19.68]Teeth.
[23:23.98]I should probably name this goblin teeth, not just regular teeth.
[23:27.22]Compass or flute.
[23:34.73]Let's do it.
[23:36.67]Here you are.
[23:37.13]There's the poll.
[23:40.32]Go vote on what you think I should take.
[23:45.69]There's a lot of options here.
[23:47.01]Usually I just do one or two or maybe even three.
[23:50.01]This is going to be interesting.
[23:53.27]This will be interesting.
[23:57.80]Look up what they are.
[23:58.36]Bee's wax is to sharpen your blade.
[24:00.58]Goblin teeth summons a goblin.
[24:03.04]I don't know what the compass does.
[24:06.52]I don't know.
[24:06.86]I don't think there's a spell for the compass.
[24:09.78]I think it's just a compass.
[24:11.12]And then the bamboo flute makes people dance.
[24:16.61]Or I don't want anything.
[24:17.79]Oh, well, I guess I could have put that, but what if we want you to take nothing?
[24:22.20]Well, I want an item.
[24:24.10]I want to get an item out of this, because items are extremely important.
[24:28.64]There are some things you do where you have to have an item, and you have to do it in a certain way.
[24:35.89]So I don't want anything.
[24:38.33]Well, I don't not want anything.
[24:40.17]I want one of these four items, and it's you guys have to decide which one.
[24:44.38]Makes people dance?
[24:45.10]That's amazing.
[24:45.82]Yeah, it is.
[24:48.93]Another like 10 seconds.
[24:52.93]Compass probably leads to a side quest with loot.
[24:54.85]It's possible, yeah.
[24:58.01]Looks like Goblin Teeth are going to win.
[25:01.64]Wait, what?
[25:02.88]How do you find the poll?
[25:03.64]I'm linking the poll every few seconds in the chat.
[25:09.67]Kusei for seven months.
[25:11.67]And I think I already said hello to Minkfur, but too much.
[25:13.94]Thank you, Megacarp, for your seven months.
[25:17.16]Thank you also for thinking not enough zapping.
[25:18.68]Yeah.
[25:20.78]And thanks, Foxafury.
[25:22.28]Foxafury?
[25:23.22]I have homework I have to do.
[25:25.94]I will fail for sure now.
[25:27.26]Oh, no.
[25:31.37]Don't fail.
[25:33.29]Because of me.
[25:36.54]Alright.
[25:37.18]Poll is closing in 10 seconds.
[25:39.64]10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
[25:39.96]5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[25:40.12]Alright.
[25:42.26]We're going to get goblin teeth.
[25:45.47]We're going to take the teeth.
[25:46.61]Thank you for voting.
[25:47.23]Poll is closed.
[25:48.21]Goblin teeth won by a very large margin.
[25:52.05]And the teeth.
[25:53.89]You take the little pouch of teeth and look inside.
[25:55.67]Four goblin's teeth.
[25:57.47]Anything else?
[25:58.26]The gnome asks.
[25:59.60]Oh, we can take...
[26:04.74]Hold on a minute.
[26:06.07]I don't know about this.
[26:11.71]I feel like taking more than a couple things is going to cause problems.
[26:23.80]Did that hurt me?
[26:25.54]How much health did I have before?
[26:28.64]Take it all?
[26:31.22]I guess I can take it all, right?
[26:32.26]No, no, no.
[26:33.80]Something bad is going to happen.
[26:35.22]You don't just get shit.
[26:36.02]Look at this guy.
[26:37.96]You honestly think this little shit's going to give me stuff for free?
[26:41.38]No, he's like the sleep wizard.
[26:43.16]No way.
[26:45.64]Fuck the consequences.
[26:46.64]Get the fruit.
[26:47.34]I thought you said fruit.
[26:50.72]Take it all and zap him.
[26:55.55]There's got to be consequences.
[26:59.17]Alright, I'm gonna get the flute.
[27:00.53]For a moment, you seem to see something move in the corner of your eye.
[27:02.79]You pick up the pipe and play a quick and merry tune.
[27:05.41]The gnome smiles.
[27:06.57]That's two items so far, the gnome remarks, counting on his fingers.
[27:11.76]This is gonna kill me.
[27:13.10]He's gonna kill me.
[27:15.56]He's gonna kill me.
[27:22.78]I still have money.
[27:24.64]I don't remember this from my last playthrough.
[27:27.82]I don't remember what this does.
[27:32.30]Seriously, run.
[27:33.20]Yeah, no, that's enough.
[27:37.99]I gotta go.
[27:39.25]I gotta go.
[27:39.77]Give him the berries.
[27:42.17]I wish.
[27:45.21]It's a giraffe.
[27:45.87]Bail.
[27:46.41]Bail.
[27:46.89]You're getting played.
[27:52.64]Pray to the elephant.
[27:55.58]Oh, I don't know.
[27:58.51]Give me the beeswax.
[27:59.89]You pick up the beeswax.
[28:00.79]There is enough in the jar for three spells.
[28:03.47]You feel something touch your side for a moment, but when you look around, there's nothing there.
[28:08.01]A fourth as well?
[28:08.99]The gnome should... No, get me out of here.
[28:10.25]Goodbye.
[28:12.95]That's enough.
[28:14.35]All done?
[28:15.03]The gnome answers.
[28:16.15]Very good.
[28:17.11]I counted that you've taken three things, so that means I've taken the same number of things of yours.
[28:21.84]I'm very quick.
[28:22.82]You probably didn't even notice me doing it.
[28:25.00]Good day.
[28:26.30]The gnome gestures towards the door for you to leave.
[28:30.02]Wait, what did he take?
[28:31.94]The gnome looks surprised.
[28:35.88]Well, really, I have no idea.
[28:37.82]I'm a kleptomaniac, as should be fairly obvious.
[28:41.40]And what's more, I couldn't see into your pack when I was taking it, could I?
[28:45.50]But I'm very fair, and I took exactly the right amount of things, so we're all square.
[28:53.42]Give me my stuff back, you little wizard.
[29:03.36]Look around for my things.
[29:04.44]There's no way I'm gonna find them.
[29:08.54]Should've just robbed them.
[29:09.96]Yeah, I gotta go.
[29:11.51]This is not... This is not gonna end well.
[29:13.83]Accept the deal and leave.
[29:15.33]You head back out of the hovel.
[29:16.31]You return back along the path to the junction.
[29:17.73]What did we lose?
[29:20.47]What did I lose?
[29:22.29]Beeswax.
[29:23.10]Goblin teeth.
[29:23.68]Bracelet.
[29:24.76]A phone.
[29:25.06]He didn't take the bracelet.
[29:27.86]What, did he take the face mask?
[29:29.32]Oh, shit.
[29:29.82]That's... Good.
[29:32.65]What else did he take?
[29:33.81]He took the face mask?
[29:35.33]Did he take my sword?
[29:36.99]I hope not.
[29:41.69]I hope he didn't take anything important.
[29:49.33]Why is someone still there?
[29:50.29]He took the skull cap.
[29:59.31]The mask and the skull are gone.
[30:01.89]Shit.
[30:04.10]Well, we're going to have to rely on dumbass goblins to get us out of trouble.
[30:08.56]Go get it back.
[30:09.60]Rewind.
[30:11.65]No, there are no rewinds.
[30:15.59]He took the chain.
[30:16.37]He took the magic chain.
[30:17.43]Okay.
[30:21.05]He took flanker.
[30:22.63]No more mind reading.
[30:23.47]That's actually a pretty big deal.
[30:25.81]What do I have in return?
[30:28.59]This actually might turn out to be very good.
[30:32.91]I can make my blade really sharp, which gives me stamina edge on opponents.
[30:38.83]And the four goblin teeth are just going to be good to have goblins do what I... I've used that spell before.
[30:44.34]What you do is you throw a tooth down and you cast gob on it.
[30:48.19]And it turns into a little goblin that you can have do whatever you want.
[30:52.09]So you can have your goblin fight for you.
[30:53.99]And see what happens.
[30:55.55]You can have your goblin do whatever you want.
[30:57.23]You can have him check a tunnel.
[30:58.52]You can have him open a door.
[30:59.52]It's not a bad thing to have.
[31:02.20]So I'm okay with that.
[31:07.92]He took really useful items.
[31:09.14]Better rewind.
[31:12.26]I left early last time.
[31:13.87]Where is Flanker?
[31:21.10]Oh, that's funny.
[31:23.78]Alright, let's keep going.
[31:24.86]Edge of the Wasteland.
[31:32.03]Goblin teeth to rob them.
[31:33.39]Use the goblin.
[31:33.93]I would.
[31:34.23]That would be awesome.
[31:35.93]After a while, another path joins this one.
[31:37.58]Looking back along, you see a broken fountain.
[31:40.22]You're back at the far edge of the wasteland.
[31:42.48]Ahead, the sun is setting behind the trees ahead.
[31:48.04]I mean, I'm really low on health.
[31:49.48]The fountain could be a fountain of youth type deal.
[31:51.71]You know, be easy to take it.
[31:58.05]Let's go.
[31:58.37]I'm going to the fountain.
[32:01.62]You make your way between blasted walls and weed-encrusted rubble.
[32:04.96]There is a constant movement in the corner of your eyes.
[32:08.18]Rats scurrying to hide under the stones and in the cracks.
[32:12.86]The path turns around a large stone fountain, which is toppled over on one side, revealing an empty well shaft leading down into the Earth.
[32:22.41]Look at the fountain.
[32:24.09]The fountain is carved to resemble a gigantic serpent, leaning up from the base of the pedestal, with its jaws open to devour a marble sun.
[32:32.71]Openings in the stone suggest that when the fountain was working, water ran between its scales and down onto the base, as though the serpent was being pushed down by a rainstorm.
[32:44.35]Oh boy, everyone's doing the rat song.
[32:50.79]Um...
[32:54.45]I don't have any... I don't want to waste a coin here.
[33:01.41]That's a dumb idea.
[33:04.06]Let me guess.
[33:04.46]I'm going to fall into the well.
[33:06.50]No.
[33:08.48]Nope.
[33:10.62]Have I ever played Dishonored?
[33:12.88]I have played Dishonored.
[33:13.92]I played the first one.
[33:15.76]I don't think I ever beat it, though.
[33:19.98]No, I'm not using a coin.
[33:20.82]I only got four coins.
[33:22.38]That's enough to buy, like, one bomb of fruit.
[33:26.37]Look at all these Prime subs.
[33:28.35]Sorry, I can't, like, um... I'm not being notified for the Prime subs, I don't think.
[33:33.21]But thank you, nonetheless, to everybody that's using their free Prime subscription on me.
[33:38.24]I appreciate it.
[33:39.78]It's very generous of you.
[33:41.70]But I can't see it.
[33:42.56]It's not really popping up on my alerts or anything.
[33:47.72]Or maybe it is, and I'm just dumb.
[33:49.32]I don't think it is.
[33:51.46]You return to the far edge of the wasteland.
[33:53.06]Ahead, the sun is almost gone, and the trees glow with color.
[33:57.08]Looks like we're climbing the fence.
[34:01.46]The path ends at a tall and ancient iron fence overgrown with weeds.
[34:05.08]Through the dense leaves you can make out a wide area beyond, dotted with stones and small buildings and straight, somber trees.
[34:12.81]Whatever it is, it can't be as deserted and empty as the place you are leaving.
[34:19.86]What can I do here?
[34:28.45]Zap!
[34:30.33]I can't even do it.
[34:31.65]What about casting Zap and what?
[34:37.17]What would I be casting Zap on?
[34:38.43]Just electrocuting the fence for no reason?
[34:44.39]Tell the goblin to go find Flanker.
[34:48.47]We'll do a how.
[34:49.39]Find some safe passage here.
[34:52.33]I can't cast Zap.
[34:53.23]I don't have enough health.
[34:55.81]It would have killed me.
[34:58.46]You cast the spell and a clear, calm voice enters your mind to tell you there is a way through the fence already present.
[35:04.43]You cannot see it, however, so it must be covered up somehow.
[35:07.51]The voice offers no more aid and then the spell fizzles away.
[35:10.51]Something, a rat perhaps, scurries through the fence and back into the wasteland.
[35:17.80]Okay, I'm going to pull the ivy.
[35:19.12]He said he can't see it, so I'm going to pull the ivy away.
[35:22.50]You crouch down and begin to clear ivy from the base of the fence.
[35:25.15]Sure enough, a foxhole is quickly revealed, which tunnels directly underneath.
[35:31.45]Hmm.
[35:33.59]Cast howl again.
[35:34.53]Cast howl.
[35:34.99]I mean, I could do big.
[35:41.38]I could just grow in size and step over this fence.
[35:44.54]But I feel like that's so lazy.
[35:50.32]Zen.
[35:50.88]Hover in the air.
[35:51.50]I don't have a medallion.
[35:55.38]Why is Zap on this list?
[35:58.29]Why is it on here?
[36:01.33]Zap the Ivy?
[36:02.51]Like, why?
[36:03.81]What is that going to do for me?
[36:06.51]Is it going to make me waste three stamina?
[36:10.51]What else is there?
[36:11.99]Something definitely is going to go wrong here.
[36:13.71]Why would it tell me to have all these spells?
[36:15.55]Blow up the fence.
[36:21.34]Do you get money for our prime subs?
[36:23.39]I... I would assume.
[36:26.17]I don't know.
[36:27.31]I haven't really looked that much into it.
[36:32.77]Zap the rats.
[36:34.94]Zap is the best spell.
[36:35.98]No, you know, I don't have... I can't... I don't want to add another death to the death counter.
[36:41.70]I don't have anything to heal.
[36:46.62]I got nothing.
[36:47.32]I have two health.
[36:48.80]I have to just climb through.
[36:50.68]I can't waste another HP.
[36:52.96]I'm climbing into the hole.
[36:54.82]You kneel down and wiggle your way into the foxhole.
[36:57.60]It is so narrow that you have to keep your arms out in front of you and drag your pack along behind.
[37:03.00]But thankfully, it is short, coming up on the other side of the fence, less than two strides away.
[37:07.55]You pull yourself up from a hole in the ground into a graveyard.
[37:12.87]I would have just zapped the fence.
[37:14.47]There was nothing here.
[37:19.13]Make the rats dance.
[37:23.13]You are standing in the grounds of the necropolis, a city within the city, occupied by headstones and mausoleums of the dead.
[37:30.38]Somewhere between the yews and cedars, you can make out the wide road that loops through the graveyard before turning uphill as it heads for the far gate.
[37:38.54]The wind whistles between all the trees.
[37:40.80]The sun is setting behind the wall.
[37:44.31]Let's look at the graves.
[37:45.93]You step nervously off the path and walk between the nearest tombs.
[37:49.67]Tombs, tombs, I know.
[37:51.96]Some are ancient headstones titled to crazy angles tilted, and some of them fallen face down as though the citizens of this graveyard have been drinking since they died.
[38:02.50]Others are fresh, neatly carved, and clean of all moss and weeds.
[38:05.53]They sparkle in the moonlight as though cleaned by maids and waiting for their occupants to arrive.
[38:15.25]Older tombs, right?
[38:19.93]Older tombs.
[38:25.85]Do you think the goblins... Oh my god, Ultra Guy.
[38:28.89]What?
[38:30.94]Wait, what?
[38:32.00]That was a little extreme.
[38:34.58]As Kinger comes in with a sub.
[38:35.96]Thanks for seven months.
[38:38.36]Thanks, Mr. Peanut, by the way.
[38:40.26]And the epic big E.
[38:44.64]and never trust a purple for the 100 bits there was a list of you guys that came in alright let's see old tombs you wind your way between the headstones to reach the oldest area of the graveyard in the corner nearest to the city wall most of the stones here are now rubble a few statues lie face down in the mud a tree has split through a carved stone coffin search for grave goods what does that even mean search for grave goods
[39:13.35]A guy left a pocket watch on him?
[39:15.68]What does that mean?
[39:18.88]Huh.
[39:20.70]Hmm.
[39:20.80]I'm gonna find... Let's find the... No, let's... I guess we'll search.
[39:31.46]You search between the ancient headstones for any offerings or grave goods left behind, but these tombs are hundreds of years old.
[39:38.23]No one visits them anymore, and offerings that were left here have long sunk into the city clay.
[39:45.39]Find the oldest grave.
[39:47.15]You soon find what looks to be the oldest tomb.
[39:51.15]It is a small mausoleum with a low roof supported by ornately carved pillars.
[39:56.76]An inscription reads, Here lies Lorag, founder of Kare.
[40:01.64]That's strange.
[40:02.72]Didn't you meet a man named Lorag?
[40:05.82]Yeah, what's up with that?
[40:08.95]ACG schmuck, thanks for ca- Oh, grave robber.
[40:12.80]Yeah, I already met a guy named Lorag.
[40:14.46]I burnt his house down.
[40:15.34]Oh, he burnt his own house down.
[40:19.10]Look at the mausoleum.
[40:21.28]The tomb is a simple one.
[40:22.92]The tomb is a simple stone cabinet carved by the likeness of a man.
[40:26.66]From centuries of rain and wind, you can make out nothing of it but a long, grisly beard.
[40:31.76]Below the inscription is a longer tablet, but it is half-weathered and covered in moss.
[40:37.67]Let's clear it.
[40:38.48]Let's do the thing where you rub your hand back and forth on the dust.
[40:41.66]You clear away the dirt from the carved inscription, but you still cannot make out the words.
[40:45.90]Only trace their outlines with your finger.
[40:48.64]The eyes of the carved statue appear to be watching you.
[40:53.39]Okay.
[40:55.11]Make a rubbing.
[40:55.75]What?
[40:56.71]What the hell does that mean?
[41:02.98]Make a rubbing.
[41:05.68]For a rubbing of the inscription, you would need some kind of charcoal to rub with and you have nothing that will do.
[41:12.40]Shit.
[41:16.20]Examine the carved man.
[41:18.52]You look closer at the carved man, clearing away the spider webs, the dirt and mud, you can make out a little more of his features.
[41:24.90]It is surely quite impossible, but if this is not the same man as the wizard you met earlier, then it is his direct ancestor.
[41:34.26]Wait, what?
[41:35.77]Yeah, I know.
[41:36.35]What?
[41:37.33]I don't get it.
[41:39.75]That was his son or something.
[41:42.51]Open the fucking thing.
[41:44.17]You look for a crack to lever open the lid of the tomb, but find nothing.
[41:48.63]Presumably, if there was anything here to steal, it would have been long gone already.
[41:52.57]You head away from the tomb.
[41:59.22]Hmm...
[42:01.91]Well, too bad I made that guy die.
[42:06.78]There are several tombs here.
[42:08.66]There must have been a recent plague on the rich city.
[42:12.26]Oh, 100 bits.
[42:12.76]Oh, wait!
[42:13.63]We got some bits!
[42:14.85]Actually, we had a couple of bits coming.
[42:17.25]Let me see your Jimmer Moons Prime subs.
[42:22.73]And thank you BossySuit and ACG Schmuck.
[42:25.16]I think I already caught you, but thanks, dude.
[42:26.82]Thanks, guys.
[42:30.44]Not a prime sub.
[42:33.74]Pull time.
[42:35.86]No, this is way too many paths.
[42:39.26]There are several tomes here.
[42:41.68]There must have been a recent plague on the rich in the city.
[42:44.67]They are scattered around in roughly alphabetical groups.
[42:48.81]It's both to Anagil, the ferret, Niferit, Temur, Ogzor.
[42:54.21]God, I'm just going to go in alphabetical order.
[42:56.89]You browse around the tombs looking for a name you recognize, but none of them catch your eye.
[43:00.93]Something flitters past your face.
[43:03.32]A bat?
[43:05.94]That's scary.
[43:10.02]On to the next one.
[43:12.68]You meander further between the gravestones, but still nothing stands out for you.
[43:18.25]What about Auxil?
[43:20.05]You look from one headstone to the other.
[43:21.57]A few catch your eye, though you cannot immediately say why.
[43:29.22]Pryas, Rifts, and Shinva.
[43:32.78]Wait a minute.
[43:35.26]What was the name of them?
[43:37.74]Lord Shinva.
[43:39.88]Lord Shinva is one of the nobles of Kar.
[43:45.24]Rulas is a noble...
[43:48.63]Okay, we're going in Shinva.
[43:49.93]We're gonna go to Shinva.
[43:53.99]Shinva's Mausoleum.
[43:57.16]You approach Shinva's Mausoleum, carved above its door.
[44:00.76]Here rests Lord Shinva, 5th Noble of Kare.
[44:04.06]Your heart hammers.
[44:05.38]Is this the undead noble you were warned you would need to find?
[44:11.32]Okay.
[44:15.48]It's another map here.
[44:17.75]Hold on.
[44:18.01]Let's, uh...
[44:44.47]Let's do a little bit of sense danger here.
[44:47.13]No, I can't do that.
[44:48.53]I have one stamina.
[44:54.31]What are my goblins?
[45:00.56]Whose mind am I going to read?
[45:04.34]I can't do gob.
[45:09.32]Protect from magic.
[45:14.56]Throw a fireball.
[45:15.92]Oh, no.
[45:16.28]How?
[45:16.62]Find safe passage.
[45:21.72]Sense danger costs one.
[45:22.70]Yeah, it does.
[45:27.55]Alright, I gotta... I can't afford it.
[45:29.95]I can't afford it.
[45:37.53]Oh, thank you, snouse rifle.
[45:41.77]It's too cold to stand still in the shadow of the wall.
[45:46.47]This game looks weird and boring, but thanks for being awesome.
[45:49.13]Oh, this is far from weird and boring.
[45:51.69]Well, weird maybe.
[45:53.36]But this is one of my all-time favorite game books.
[46:00.20]It's just a lot of fun.
[46:03.34]Walk into the tomb.
[46:04.58]Jump over the ring.
[46:08.01]Alright, well the mushrooms are here for a reason.
[46:10.11]They're probably going to do something bad.
[46:11.59]Let's see if I can just jump over them.
[46:12.89]Because seriously, walking in the... They're in a ring.
[46:18.16]Made some pancakes.
[46:18.84]They were awful.
[46:19.30]Now I'm upset.
[46:19.82]But I'm slightly happy.
[46:22.10]Thank you, Radio Vidya.
[46:23.94]And thank you to Ultra Lazuli for the 700 bits.
[46:27.32]It's a good game.
[46:30.28]Jump over the ring.
[46:32.16]I'm not going to take a chance to get electrocuted if I step through a trap.
[46:37.64]You take a run up and jump clear over the circle of mushrooms, landing on the step of the mausoleum.
[46:43.15]Yeah, we ain't fucking with that right now.
[46:44.43]Let's go on the tomb.
[46:46.65]We came here for a reason, not to eat a bunch of shrooms and, like, trip.
[46:51.05]The air inside is freezing.
[46:53.10]Dust coats the floor, urns line the walls, but there is no coffin.
[46:56.84]The floor space is empty, except for in the far corner, where a narrow stone staircase leads down into darkness.
[47:07.24]I only have enough for one spell.
[47:15.86]Cause depression?
[47:21.51]Sun, create light.
[47:22.45]Sun jewel, I don't have a sun jewel.
[47:28.23]Fog, summon darkness.
[47:29.49]Why would I summon darkness in darkness?
[47:32.93]Doesn't that make no sense?
[47:39.58]Oh, float in the air.
[47:42.12]Listen to me, son.
[47:44.65]I'm your dad.
[47:47.05]Destroy him!
[47:50.51]Whoa!
[47:51.99]What's up, Bugs Bunny?
[47:53.78]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[47:56.41]Let's go.
[47:56.87]Make a move.
[47:57.39]I'm going to get fucking screwed here.
[48:00.44]Turn and flee.
[48:03.32]No, no, no.
[48:03.84]I didn't want to do that.
[48:04.84]I did not mean to do that.
[48:06.30]I didn't mean to do that.
[48:08.06]This is not a rewind.
[48:09.06]That was an accident.
[48:09.92]That was accident.
[48:11.66]I did not mean to do that.
[48:12.66]This is not a rewind.
[48:15.28]I wanted to go that way.
[48:16.26]That's not a legit rewind.
[48:18.00]I dragged the wrong way like this.
[48:19.89]See how it's like I'm not even moved and I'm touching it?
[48:22.78]See?
[48:24.08]Yeah.
[48:24.86]That was not a rewind.
[48:26.53]We're going down.
[48:28.99]This is a bad place to have two stamina and four gold.
[48:31.83]No, that wasn't even a rewind.
[48:36.21]I just proved it to you.
[48:43.60]I'm afraid of what you might find below you make your way towards the stairs But you must have stepped on some kind of switch as behind you you hear a noise and you turn to see the doors swinging shut I'll get it locked in here.
[48:58.42]Let it close let it
[49:05.15]You stay back, not wanting to be crushed by the heavy stone door.
[49:08.95]It seals with a bang, and you are plunged in darkness, filled only with the sound of your own breathing.
[49:17.55]And one other noise.
[49:19.08]A distant rattle of chains.
[49:21.50]I'm just in the dark.
[49:24.59]What's up, Millet and Siegel?
[49:25.93]Thanks for the six months.
[49:27.78]Well, it isn't dark.
[49:29.58]The echo of the slamming door circles the room.
[49:31.90]Things are moving across the flagstones.
[49:36.72]Come on.
[49:38.70]You wanna fuck with me?
[49:40.56]You wanna fuck with me?
[49:44.04]What do we got?
[49:45.68]I only have enough of one stamina.
[49:49.60]Create light.
[49:50.86]Oh, I don't have a fucking sun jewel.
[49:54.40]cause depression whatever isn't whatever like is like moving around this room is about to get real depressed what else do we got hold on hold on prey to the dolphin
[50:15.87]Hey, thanks.
[50:16.39]It's Weenie.
[50:17.05]Getting a couple of new subs due to Twitch Prime, but no alert anyways.
[50:19.77]Hey.
[50:20.51]Yeah, thanks.
[50:21.47]Like I said before, I don't think it's not coming up on my alerts.
[50:26.18]But I can see a lot of people are doing it.
[50:29.22]I am humbled that you would choose me as your Twitch sub that you got from Amazon Prime.
[50:34.88]So thanks.
[50:36.86]And then Suicidal Spree.
[50:39.12]ZER.
[50:39.88]Summon Lord Zaraxas.
[50:43.91]I wish.
[50:45.72]Well... I can... This is my one spell.
[50:53.82]It's Sense Danger.
[50:54.74]I have one stamina after this.
[50:58.87]I know there's something in this room that's dangerous.
[51:03.65]There's danger.
[51:04.27]There's danger in this room.
[51:05.87]We're gonna cast Depression.
[51:07.85]Sap.
[51:08.75]Cause Depression.
[51:10.25]You cast the spell, causing the only living creature within sight to begin to lose its will and vitality.
[51:15.26]You.
[51:25.28]The glow of the mausoleum becomes overpowering, and you can hardly lift your head to look around.
[51:31.62]You might as well sink into the dirt right now or rot standing up.
[51:35.61]At least you will have a decent tomb.
[51:38.05]Much better than if you die out in the backlands, as you are likely to do.
[51:42.09]Sit down and die, or stand up and die.
[51:52.47]Pray to the dolphin.
[51:53.85]I gotta pray to the dolphin.
[51:56.54]Stand up and die.
[51:58.96]What?
[51:59.71]You settle down on the ground in order to have less of a shock when you die.
[52:02.93]At least you will not fall.
[52:05.47]Time passes, but it hardly seems to matter.
[52:10.50]It is the end.
[52:11.68]Until quite suddenly your spirits rise.
[52:14.50]Perhaps things aren't so bad after all.
[52:16.10]Surely you can escape this place if you try a little harder.
[52:18.46]The spell lifts and so does your heart.
[52:20.14]The darkness is absolute.
[52:21.59]Anything could have... What?
[52:27.61]Oh, no.
[52:31.90]I got to pray.
[52:32.60]I got to pray to the dolphin.
[52:33.42]Is he with me?
[52:33.92]He's with me.
[52:34.95]The dolphin is with me right now.
[52:37.13]Pray to the dolphin.
[52:39.14]You close your eyes and raise a fervent prayer to the dolphin.
[52:42.48]For a moment, you do not think it is heard, and then somewhere underground, you hear a mighty crash, as though a heavy weight had fallen from a fraying rope.
[52:51.01]The door judders in response.
[52:52.83]It seems the counterweight which had caused it to close has come away, so you now should be able to open the door.
[52:58.65]Get it open.
[52:59.67]Getting your fingers into the crack, into the wall, you're able to pry it open a fraction, and then a little further still into the cool air of the graveyards flowing into the mausoleum, you gra-
[53:10.07]Get me out of here.
[53:12.15]Soothing rushes across your boots into the crack in the stone.
[53:14.69]Get out.
[53:15.49]Leave.
[53:17.43]You are taking no more chances.
[53:18.69]You head quickly out the door and back into the path.
[53:22.37]No, don't rewind.
[53:23.27]Do not rewind.
[53:24.49]No, don't rewind.
[53:27.37]Don't do this.
[53:28.41]Go up here and leave.
[53:29.85]I'm not prepared for this.
[53:40.48]The dolphin.
[53:41.34]The dolphin saved us again.
[53:43.42]How many times has the dolphin saved us?
[53:50.27]How many times has the dolphin rescued us?
[53:59.19]See coward coward coward coward then somebody wrote loser I Have one stamina, what do you guys want me to do?
[54:16.16]It's she it's absolute guaranteed death with one stamina in a scary tome of
[54:27.43]You avoid the ring of mushrooms as you leave.
[54:29.57]Outside, night is falling.
[54:31.45]And things are stirring between them.
[54:32.85]Look, I learned a couple of things.
[54:34.85]I learned that Lorag's, like, great-grandfather was also Lorag.
[54:40.97]Sit down and die.
[54:42.01]Hey, every time somebody called me a coward, how many times did I zap somebody?
[54:49.04]How many times did I zap an innocent person?
[54:51.40]Is that being a coward?
[54:52.26]Yeah, it is.
[54:53.56]Yeah, it is.
[54:54.34]It is.
[54:54.78]Yeah, it is.
[54:56.26]I'm gonna keep going.
[54:58.68]Outside, night is falling and things are stirring between the moaning trees.
[55:01.48]You would do well not to linger here.
[55:03.54]Something scurries across your foot and is gone.
[55:08.53]Well, there it is.
[55:14.51]I need to go to bed.
[55:17.88]You return to the path gratefully and make your way to the far side of the graveyard.
[55:21.56]Beside the gate is a disused well.
[55:24.56]Another well perhaps once used to draw water to wash the bodies before.
[55:27.82]Alright, I know.
[55:30.71]The wells bring you down to the sewer.
[55:32.49]I remember.
[55:32.93]I completely remember it.
[55:37.57]This is something that just came back to me.
[55:39.59]Like after playing through this a couple years ago.
[55:43.35]Well, this way I can pull the bucket up though.
[55:46.11]You turn the winch on the side of the well, drawing up the bucket from beneath.
[55:49.97]It comes to the top, filled with clear water.
[55:52.63]Is this as fresh as the water from the other fountain you tried?
[55:56.18]Like, four hours ago?
[55:58.44]Drink from the bucket.
[55:59.10]I need to.
[55:59.90]If it kills me, it kills me.
[56:00.76]Drink.
[56:02.16]You scoop a handful of water and taste it.
[56:04.10]Despite your surroundings, it is fresh and quite clear.
[56:07.57]You feel much better for it.
[56:12.13]I love a graveyard water.
[56:14.99]It's apparently the cleanest water in the city of Kari.
[56:19.33]Memory is cheating.
[56:24.06]I believe that's what happens when you go in the well.
[56:28.50]Go back to the tome.
[56:30.10]Go back to the tomb.
[56:30.89]I finally gave in to these bit things.
[56:34.15]You deserve every amount I give you.
[56:35.37]Love your content.
[56:35.99]Well, thank you.
[56:36.37]No soup for you.
[56:40.43]Wait.
[56:41.01]You lean over the side of the well house to peer down.
[56:43.85]It is pitch black, of course, and seems to go on forever.
[56:47.03]Then for a moment, it looks as though there is something in the shaft.
[56:50.21]But a moment later, it is gone.
[56:51.55]A trick of the moonlight, perhaps.
[56:56.77]No, we're moving on.
[56:58.11]Now, I want to get up to the... up here.
[57:02.06]The rear gate of the graveyard hangs from its hinges, but not from age.
[57:05.12]It seems it has been taken apart, maybe widened even to let something through, beyond its deep forest.
[57:12.57]Yeah, our goal is here.
[57:13.69]This is what we were told.
[57:17.27]Corga lives here.
[57:18.99]That's what we were told.
[57:22.50]Damn dirty rats.
[57:25.12]Thanks a lot, Mosley Bird, for seven months.
[57:26.72]Welcome back as we go all the way through the forest.
[57:33.78]You walk for half an hour through thick trees along a narrowing track until you reach a fork in the road.
[57:39.59]To the left, the track gets narrower still.
[57:42.51]To the right, a massive shadow looms so large it seems as though a colossus had seated itself on the wall in thought.
[57:49.49]A chill wind blows through you as though ghosts walked back and forth this way.
[57:55.76]Look at the shadowy shape.
[57:57.77]The shadow to the right is a jagged silhouette.
[57:59.99]It is a ziggurat with perhaps a hundred steps leading to its apex.
[58:03.91]The trees whisper and move.
[58:06.89]The left way, you see a distant flicker torchlight through the trees, the north gate perhaps.
[58:12.39]Night is drawing in.
[58:13.77]You should get moving.
[58:15.27]Things whisper between the trees.
[58:20.91]Yeah, so here's the north gate.
[58:24.52]This is the north gate.
[58:25.42]This is the... You leave through the north gate to get to the next part.
[58:36.93]Thank you, Meester.
[58:38.45]Welcome, Meester.
[58:40.64]No, don't rewind.
[58:41.38]I'm going to go up to the ziggurat.
[58:46.18]This is where the god is.
[58:48.27]You stand at the base of a towering ziggurat built from carved stone blocks, each the size of a hay bale.
[58:54.90]The temple rises higher than the city wall and positioned to catch the first star of evening at its uppermost point, a moment which has just passed.
[59:04.62]Look for an opening.
[59:06.16]You tilt your head back looking for an opening and finally make one out.
[59:09.05]A small black dot about a third of the way up, but even that is quite some climb.
[59:14.09]For the less devoted worshippers, a small gargoyle by the steps has an open mouth, ready to accept offerings.
[59:19.58]Let's take a look at the gargoyle.
[59:24.67]The gargoyle is carved in a shape of a small but spiky dog with long claws, sharp horns, and a pointy beard.
[59:32.61]Its mouth is wide open and its tongue lulls out, with a coin-shaped slot at the back of its throat.
[59:40.64]We kind of have to donate to the gods, right?
[59:43.08]Let's drop a coin in.
[59:45.26]You slide a coin piece into the gargoyle's mouth.
[59:47.38]For a moment, nothing happens.
[59:48.78]Then it appears to swallow.
[59:50.60]And next, it opens its stone eyelids to reveal two crisp and beautiful eyes.
[59:56.76]Two crisp and beautiful eyes.
[59:58.80]Crisp.
[60:00.18]I've never heard somebody describe eyes crisp.
[60:04.28]Wait, what?
[60:05.72]I've heard people talk about water like that or iced tea.
[60:09.09]Not necessarily eyeballs.
[60:14.44]I'm just going to stare directly into its eyes.
[60:18.08]Looking into the gargoyle's eyes fills you with a sense of calm and peace.
[60:22.00]The eyes close after a moment, but the sense of well-being remains.
[60:25.35]Or did you just imagine that the gargoyle moved?
[60:29.67]Oh, we got four more stamina.
[60:31.53]Look at those crispy, crunchy, delicious eyes.
[60:40.00]Climb up.
[60:41.60]You begin the climb, hauling yourself up the first step.
[60:43.80]Either this ziggurat was built for giants, or ascending is an act of devotion.
[60:49.67]The next few steps are equally exhausting.
[60:51.15]You have to throw your pack up first and follow.
[60:54.61]Give up.
[60:57.18]At least I got enough stamina.
[60:58.28]Let's see what we can do.
[61:01.20]I could, like, float, right?
[61:02.92]Just float up there.
[61:09.13]no that's hover I know there's like a float spell there's float how come why is it why the two floats alright it's either float to the top or that's how
[61:33.72]Did you do bad big?
[61:35.22]Grow in size?
[61:36.02]Oh, that's where we're at.
[61:36.82]Are you kidding me?
[61:38.36]We're just gonna get huge and walk over the whole thing.
[61:40.82]Let's do it.
[61:41.34]Absolutely.
[61:43.21]You cast a spell swelling to three times your size.
[61:46.27]You are now able to run up the stairs.
[61:48.69]But the scale quickly changes.
[61:50.43]It seems the builders of the pyramid created an optical illusion and the later steps are not as high as the lower ones.
[61:56.35]The change is so gradual that you hardly notice as the spell fades.
[61:59.96]You reach a halfway point almost as high as the city wall point and pause to rest.
[62:05.52]You are halfway up.
[62:07.67]Freezes of gargoyles and polished metals ring the temple on this level.
[62:16.68]Let's take a look at the view.
[62:20.67]You pause, take a look at the view from this side of the ziggurat.
[62:22.53]You can see nothing but the top of the wall and beyond.
[62:26.03]The gleaming darkness of the marshes of the baklans.
[62:30.96]Let's walk around.
[62:32.26]You move around to the north face.
[62:33.92]You can see the path ahead running straight between wild and overgrown trees.
[62:38.18]It seems very few people come this way anymore.
[62:41.19]The north gate itself is now visible, however, and appears deserted.
[62:45.49]Then you notice a point of light.
[62:47.15]A torch has been lit between the trees.
[62:51.63]Watch the torches.
[62:53.15]You watch as the torches move through the trees towards the path.
[62:55.86]They are making slow progress, but they are moving towards the graveyard and presumably from there on into town.
[63:02.10]The wind claws at you, trying to pull you to Earth.
[63:07.96]Keep going.
[63:09.30]You continue the weary climb to the first level of the ziggurat.
[63:13.48]Let's get the opening.
[63:16.02]You climb for another 20 minutes up to steep stone steps until you are gasping and panting for breath once more.
[63:21.24]But finally, you reach the dark opening that you saw from the base of the temple.
[63:25.83]The steps themselves continue up a little further still to the very peak of the temple.
[63:32.01]The temple will explode in five minutes.
[63:35.81]Look at the opening.
[63:36.95]The opening is guarded by rock-sculpted images of unimaginable creatures.
[63:40.76]Beyond, you see a long, dark hallway with something large and gleaming at the far end.
[63:46.22]Treasure?
[63:50.28]Go in the temple or go to the top.
[63:53.03]Hmm.
[63:54.73]Huh.
[63:54.91]I lost his stamina.
[63:57.47]Alright, guys.
[63:57.85]What am I doing here?
[64:00.43]What am I doing here?
[64:03.41]Which way?
[64:05.45]In the temple or to the top?
[64:14.42]Here you go.
[64:18.59]Which way?
[64:23.25]To the top or inside the temple?
[64:24.75]Let's give this about 10 to 15 seconds.
[64:34.80]Scary ziggurat.
[64:36.64]Which way are we gonna go?
[64:41.96]Obvious trap.
[64:50.07]Yeah, what an obvious trap.
[64:52.02]Climb to the top and get the treasure.
[64:53.36]Hmm.
[64:55.70]Or die.
[64:56.12]Don't worry, I got a shitload of goblins.
[65:00.84]Just you wait.
[65:01.36]The second I'm able to use one of those little shits, they're going to do whatever I want.
[65:06.87]Get the goblin to carry you.
[65:09.93]Alright, let's give this another couple seconds here.
[65:14.44]Looks like we're going to the top.
[65:20.06]Cast depression on himself again.
[65:22.80]That was amazing.
[65:27.08]I can just imagine a guy being like, Estadio Obagandia!
[65:30.36]And like he throws up his hands and like, depression!
[65:32.20]And just weaves around and then sucks right in his body and he's like, oh shit!
[65:37.11]I feel terrible, what did I do?
[65:41.91]Send the goblin up.
[65:44.05]Alright, pulse closing.
[65:45.01]Five, four, three, two, one.
[65:48.57]To the top it is, let's go.
[65:51.29]To the top.
[65:56.72]You keep climbing before your leg sees up from the climb all the way to the top of the ziggurat.
[66:01.48]Night has fallen.
[66:02.88]Stars spread across the sky in a peaceful response that belies their true nature.
[66:07.98]Wearing spirits, tussling for control of the world below.
[66:12.31]Look at the stars.
[66:15.27]With your head tilted back, you can see more stars than you have ever seen in this city.
[66:20.63]Perhaps you are above the level of the lights and the smog and the dust, or perhaps more stars choose to cluster here around this sacred site.
[66:28.70]If you were a true mage and not a mere sorcerer, who knows what spells one could weave at a spot like this.
[66:35.88]Okay, let's do it.
[66:39.00]You lean back and look up, trying to recognize the stars from your studies.
[66:44.35]We're gonna cast the biggest zap spell that you've ever seen.
[66:48.29]Oh my god.
[66:53.23]Tech unknown.
[66:58.25]Tur unknown.
[66:59.19]What the hell do these do?
[67:01.23]Supreme zap.
[67:09.68]Lara?
[67:10.34]I don't know what any of these are.
[67:12.42]Lack?
[67:15.85]I'm gonna just cast a Pyroblast.
[67:21.07]These are all spells that I don't know.
[67:24.65]Pack?
[67:28.64]Tack?
[67:32.06]Poo?
[67:32.90]Pook?
[67:33.96]Puck?
[67:36.72]Keck.
[67:40.74]World of Warcraft.
[67:42.58]Mists of Pandaria.
[67:45.95]World of Warcraft and the cataclysm World of Warcraft legion I I'm gonna have to just take a wild guess a lot of people are saying to do dot tech attack tack tack tuck
[68:18.76]Tack.
[68:19.06]Alright, we're doing Tack.
[68:21.08]Lap?
[68:21.66]Wait, Ronnie says Lap.
[68:27.06]Oh, there's Lar and Lack.
[68:33.65]Tack.
[68:33.97]Alright, we'll go with Tack.
[68:36.69]Cast Tack.
[68:38.72]You fashion the stars into alignment, and an enchantment is created.
[68:42.64]You feel a tingling sensation in your wrist, and you look down to see flashing Sparks in your palm that flicker different colors.
[68:50.47]For a moment, gold, then white, then black.
[68:56.13]Uh... Wait.
[68:59.89]You wait to see what else happens, but the Sparks continue to glitter and glow, like fireflies dancing just within your grasp.
[69:10.06]Should I wait more or should I close my fist?
[69:11.94]I feel like if I wait longer, maybe I'll get a super zap.
[69:17.13]Eat it.
[69:17.85]He's trippin'.
[69:20.97]Oh, he's trippin'.
[69:25.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:26.83]Close your head.
[69:27.87]Wait, you're charging up.
[69:28.85]Alright, I'm waiting again.
[69:31.21]You wait a moment longer and the Sparks fade.
[69:33.07]Shit!
[69:33.73]The magic, whatever it was, is finished.
[69:35.17]You have found one of the secret spells of the Temple of Korga.
[69:38.97]The icy winds chills you to the bone.
[69:43.53]Secret spell.
[69:45.54]What is it?
[69:50.20]Wait, what?
[69:53.26]I think you never actually made it past the mushrooms.
[70:08.83]No rewinding!
[70:10.33]I got a secret spell!
[70:12.35]Let me take a look at it.
[70:13.13]Let's see what it is.
[70:18.64]Zap, Hot, Foff, Wall, Law, Dumb, Big, Walk, Dop, Raz, Seuss, Six, Jig, Gob, Yob, Gum, How, Dock, Dawes, Dud, Mag, Pop, Fal, Dim, Fog, Mud, Niftel,
[70:38.73]Gak?
[70:39.85]Sap?
[70:41.43]Where is it?
[70:43.06]Tak, right?
[70:48.92]Zed?
[70:51.74]Rez?
[70:52.10]Where is it?
[70:53.66]Did I miss it?
[70:54.32]Tak.
[71:07.40]I want to use, um, Dawes.
[71:10.17]I feel like that's, like, very, like, that's good.
[71:15.05]You didn't close your hand.
[71:18.24]Wait, is that what it was?
[71:20.46]Because I didn't close my hand up.
[71:40.76]Whoa, where am I going?
[71:42.38]Where's my character?
[71:45.79]Oh god, everything just got so fucked up.
[71:47.71]I was about to get so scared.
[71:49.11]I thought everything was done.
[71:57.02]Shit.
[71:57.48]Did I really miss out on that?
[71:58.58]I thought I was gonna, like, go around my whole body.
[72:04.29]Come back.
[72:09.37]Take that shpill.
[72:12.29]No, thank you, ironic waifu for six months.
[72:15.63]And ashen pants.
[72:16.55]And it's weenie.
[72:17.27]Thanks for the 100 bits ashen pants for seven months.
[72:19.79]And we got another one.
[72:20.47]We got Mr. Peanut.
[72:21.88]Exit stage.
[72:26.20]You made it past the gate.
[72:27.18]We won.
[72:28.06]We got over here.
[72:31.20]Alright.
[72:31.68]Well, no rewinds.
[72:34.98]No rewinds.
[72:35.78]That's the... That's the rule.
[72:40.72]I know it's a hard rule to swallow, but it's a rule.
[72:45.49]Unless I die, I can't rewind.
[72:50.63]I may have just screwed that up.
[72:53.62]Pull for rewind.
[72:55.34]No rewinds.
[72:56.38]No rewinds.
[72:57.60]Look at the view.
[72:58.94]Take your mind off that.
[72:59.78]Let's take a look at this big, beautiful view.
[73:02.55]You look out across the city.
[73:04.06]In the far distance, you see torches in the woods towards the north gate.
[73:07.66]Looking back, you see the lights of Kare coming on and the shouts of revelers, drunks, and nighttime thieves.
[73:15.74]Rewind, you coward loser.
[73:22.15]Jump off the edge and then rewind because I died.
[73:24.43]Listen to me, son.
[73:27.09]I'm your dad.
[73:28.67]No, we can't rewind.
[73:29.61]Destroy him!
[73:33.41]Decisions are permanent.
[73:35.31]That is very important.
[73:38.05]Very important.
[73:42.93]What is going on?
[73:47.19]What just happened?
[73:50.21]I heard the sub sound, but I didn't see any subs.
[73:54.69]Uh-oh.
[73:55.93]Oh, there we go.
[73:56.39]I can see it now.
[73:58.07]WaffenShopsterFjord has subscribed.
[74:01.16]Thank you.
[74:02.81]And NoName has done 100 bits.
[74:05.15]Who's NoName?
[74:06.79]That was the Rewind, you coward guy.
[74:08.71]Rewind to Flanker.
[74:10.52]And thank you MonotoneMiner for your subscription.
[74:14.10]And another 100 bits from Grandmaster Engineering.
[74:17.96]Germaglue?
[74:21.04]Oh, I didn't even know what my own emote was.
[74:23.90]I was like, what's Germaglue?
[74:25.78]Oh, I thought you were talking about the glue spell.
[74:30.05]But yeah, for those of you that weren't here the last couple of days, I will reiterate it one more time.
[74:35.99]From the very beginning of the game, I'm not... Look, I can do this.
[74:40.37]I can rewind to fucking any point over and over again and just cheat the whole time, right?
[74:45.45]But I feel like if decisions are permanent, it's better.
[74:50.00]So I'm not allowed to rewind unless I die.
[74:52.28]And I can only rewind to back where I was in safety.
[74:55.74]Not necessarily rewind a shitload.
[74:59.53]For those people that weren't here the last couple of days.
[75:03.55]I can't hold my finger on the page and turn and then see it was bad and then put my hands back.
[75:10.07]You can do that with a book.
[75:10.87]I used to do that when I was a kid.
[75:11.87]I did it all the time.
[75:14.13]And on my first playthroughs on this, I did that quite a few times.
[75:18.03]But we're doing a no-nonsense, permanent, everything's permanent run.
[75:22.26]Let's keep going.
[75:27.95]Dammit, if no rewind, be good at least.
[75:32.70]I'm having fun.
[75:35.14]I'm having fun zapping people and fucking potting people.
[75:38.06]It's fun.
[75:38.44]Alright, we're going in the temple.
[75:45.13]Going inside.
[75:45.83]Here's this nice music.
[75:51.15]Nice chimes.
[75:53.73]You step into the temple, the hollow space amplifies your footsteps, and they echo eerily for several moments.
[75:59.58]On the floor, in gilt inlay, is written the name of the god who inhabits this space.
[76:04.56]It seems that the ziggurat of Korga the Gracious.
[76:08.91]Wait a little bit.
[76:09.91]Wait for a few heartbeats to see if you have disturbed anything.
[76:12.87]Nothing happens.
[76:14.01]And then you catch the tail of a gigantic snake, slithering across the floor and disappearing into a crack in one of the walls.
[76:19.92]Wait, what?
[76:21.11]From the markings along its back, it looks highly poisonous.
[76:23.91]What?
[76:28.33]Zzap me.
[76:30.25]Thanks a lot, Hiroshi, for your four months, and Erelis for 47 bits.
[76:36.47]Highly poisonous snake.
[76:37.87]Alright, let's go.
[76:38.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[76:41.53]I thought it slipped away!
[76:42.49]I thought the snake went into one of the cracks!
[76:49.24]Wait, what?
[76:51.28]You enter the temple, but the snake still manages to catch you by surprise, launching itself from the crack in the ceiling.
[76:56.76]Full blast.
[76:59.16]Ooh!
[77:01.37]This is really loud.
[77:02.23]I'm sorry.
[77:05.07]You guys, always full blast.
[77:07.47]And then always full blast.
[77:09.87]Two-hit kill.
[77:14.95]Easy.
[77:16.36]The temple, wait a minute.
[77:17.58]Did I just kill the god's pet snake?
[77:21.67]Should I not have done that?
[77:23.03]The temple snake is retreating, but you give chase.
[77:25.41]Launching off your heels, you lunge for the beast's neck with a weird scream that echoes around the cold stone.
[77:32.02]The snake dies, its head crashing to the floor.
[77:34.36]Oh, okay.
[77:36.60]I thought that was me doing the weird scream.
[77:39.44]You lunge for the beast's neck with a weird scream.
[77:42.26]Ah!
[77:46.10]flawless fighting listen to me son I'm your dad destroy him whoa thanks a lot ultra ultra didn't you subscribe before or did you give bits your name popped up before well thanks for the uh sub appreciate it ultra lazily
[78:10.85]Going for a weird scream.
[78:12.27]You wipe your sword clean and wait for the violent echoes of the fight to fade away.
[78:16.25]Then you go further in.
[78:17.71]The sight of the shrine takes your breath away.
[78:20.79]The walls are decorated with brightly colored murals depicting scenes from the religious mythology of Kari.
[78:26.27]Fine ornaments and precious metals are set into alcoves around the pews.
[78:32.78]I don't know why I just thought of Al Pacino.
[78:38.68]I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[78:41.01]And rich woven tapestries cover every surface.
[78:44.93]A cunning trick of architecture catches the wind past the doorway and creates a constant ethereal humming as though a crowd of monks sat in permanent meditation inside.
[78:56.30]Alcoves.
[78:58.38]Aclaves.
[79:04.80]further inside there it is there is buddha alficino coves at the far end of the hallway four large stone gargoyles of winged demons watch over the shrine from mounts high up in the eaves guarding the altar in which a gigantic idol squats corga himself steal something
[79:35.53]It always gives that option, doesn't it?
[79:38.57]Fucking steal something.
[79:40.31]Take something.
[79:44.82]I'm not doing a poll for this, and I'll tell you one reason why.
[79:48.42]You don't walk into, like, this super god's ziggurat, fight a giant poisonous snake, get into the room that he's in, and steal something.
[79:59.99]There's four gargoyles in here and one of like the strongest gods in the world.
[80:04.78]Well, let me steal something.
[80:08.56]He's gonna like blow up my head.
[80:09.98]He's gonna like squish my head like a grape.
[80:15.12]Listen to me, son.
[80:16.27]I'm your dad.
[80:17.63]Steal it!
[80:19.55]Steal the idol?
[80:21.15]Coward.
[80:22.03]Coward rewind.
[80:25.40]No, you guys.
[80:26.56]You guys.
[80:27.66]You can't steal from this guy.
[80:29.92]Oh my word.
[80:30.59]Am I about to do it?
[80:31.63]I'm gonna.
[80:32.15]No.
[80:32.95]No.
[80:36.19]He tried to kill you.
[80:38.65]I need to learn these spell lines.
[80:42.62]No.
[80:44.08]The temptation is gone.
[80:45.22]Not stealing from this.
[80:47.86]You walk up towards the altar across a richly patterned carpet.
[80:51.09]Something about it gives you pause.
[80:52.53]Its surface is decorated with wide symbols that seemed too deliberate to be accidental.
[81:02.45]He said to Snow, the snake was like the guardian to like test your strength.
[81:05.67]You didn't think I was going to zap?
[81:10.83]You didn't think I was going to fucking zap?
[81:13.86]Huh?
[81:14.56]You cast the spell, creating a bolt of electricity in your palm that you unleash onto the carpet.
[81:18.54]The whole rug goes up in a flash of flame.
[81:20.78]Oh no, not the whole rug.
[81:22.06]A thin black circle is left behind as a mere outline on the stone.
[81:26.12]You step carefully around it and approach the altar.
[81:40.68]What a waste.
[81:42.48]It worked.
[81:48.63]Okay, well, it worked.
[81:51.29]To the altar.
[81:56.46]You just burned the script.
[82:02.80]Zap is always the answer.
[82:05.51]You singed the poor guy's coffin.
[82:07.47]You stand before the idol, a fat statue set with gems and curious pockmarked features.
[82:12.57]Above his head is a plaque that bears an inscription.
[82:19.03]What was the point of that?
[82:21.51]Uh, to burn his carpet.
[82:25.45]Read the inscription.
[82:27.30]It reads...
[82:40.73]You step nervously up the steps until you are below this great statue.
[82:43.73]You consider the idol.
[82:44.97]When you met Theda in the wasteland, he told you something about Korga.
[82:47.84]The left eye, that's how you start.
[82:52.16]On Korga's face, you kiss a cross and finish with the lips.
[82:56.18]For answers to your questions, you must air not else he spits.
[83:04.48]Your zaps are so glorious, I'm starting to think you are the wizard.
[83:06.80]Well, you are the wizard.
[83:12.72]left eye and you finish with the mouth corby's face you kiss across I'm your dad so it starts with left across would be right whoa right so left left eye right eye lips let's do it you stand on tiptoes to lean in preparing to kiss the statue but where does the humming in the temple seem to be getting louder
[83:43.56]Oh, fuck me.
[83:45.36]They added more variables.
[83:46.44]Okay.
[83:48.24]Left eye.
[83:50.16]Right eye.
[83:50.62]Because you start across.
[83:58.28]Left eye.
[83:59.38]First you place a kiss on the idol's left eye.
[84:03.48]Across right eye, right?
[84:19.65]Left is always the right answer.
[84:21.21]Right eye.
[84:22.51]You hear something flittering in the upper levels of the temple.
[84:24.53]Okay, that worked.
[84:25.35]It had to have, right?
[84:28.42]Alright, you end with the lips.
[84:29.60]I don't know if this... No.
[84:31.70]So there's one... Is there anything else in between?
[84:33.62]So it's either forehead or nose.
[84:39.33]Oh, no.
[84:51.84]so it'd be yeah it's it's a cross it's a cross so left eye right eye forehead nose lips can't make a cross with the nose so that'd be forehead kiss the forehead so left right up and then down what does it would end would end on lips right
[85:22.95]Well, does that mean you're coming straight down?
[85:24.59]Is it telling me that the nose has to be the middle?
[85:28.16]Is that what it is?
[85:32.02]Yeah, I would assume.
[85:34.10]Because if it's still giving me the option to nose, then it's definitely nose.
[85:41.64]Oh my god, Chad is freaking out.
[85:43.66]No, no, no, no.
[85:45.74]Nose, nose, nose, no.
[85:48.36]Don't skip the nose.
[85:50.36]Skip the nose.
[85:51.80]Kiss his nose.
[85:57.81]Kiss the nose.
[85:58.87]You kiss the idol's nose, kiss his lips.
[86:00.67]Don't puke in my mouth.
[86:02.57]You lean up and kiss the idol's lips.
[86:03.73]As you do, you hear a small click.
[86:10.87]wait there's a sharp stabbing pain in the back of your throat you try to call up but it seems the poison on the tip of the dart which has just been shot from the golden mouth into your own is too fast acting you stiffen a silent scream on your face then slump to the ground in the darkness from which you shall not away such is the price of failing the kissing ritual of Korg you have died from a god's kiss
[86:46.93]oh well nose then forehead but how would that make oh maybe you're right hold on yeah well that's that that death that's a new death I knew you should have oh boy that's it's lewd
[87:11.63]Okay.
[87:12.63]We're gonna... We're gonna do it again.
[87:15.02]Let's hope I don't die again.
[87:16.88]Corgi's face you kiss across and finish with the lips.
[87:20.38]Kiss the idol.
[87:23.48]Okay, so it's left eye.
[87:27.12]Right eye.
[87:31.21]Nose, forehead?
[87:31.97]Okay, because you have to come... Yeah.
[87:34.57]No.
[87:38.73]Not the nose.
[87:39.63]No nose.
[87:40.49]No nose.
[87:43.50]Yeah, that's what I was saying before, right?
[87:45.58]Because you go left, right, like, up, down.
[87:47.92]You wouldn't stomp on the nose.
[87:50.12]I saw a lot of people telling me to do the nose.
[87:51.68]I'm skipping the nose.
[87:54.30]Finally, you lean low and kiss the idol's lips.
[87:56.52]As you straighten once more, you see the idol's eyes flick open.
[87:59.26]Bam.
[87:59.91]Got it.
[88:00.15]That's what I was going to do in the first place.
[88:03.60]A soft voice issues from its mouth.
[88:06.37]Stranger, you are not of my faith, whispers the god.
[88:11.17]And yet, you have completed my ritual.
[88:14.71]How can that be?
[88:17.59]I'm lucky.
[88:19.33]I have used my wits.
[88:20.65]I merely read your instructions.
[88:26.24]Look at those crispy eyes.
[88:29.06]Should I just say I'm lucky?
[88:31.65]Maybe he'll think, no, I've read your instructions.
[88:34.70]I merely read your instructions.
[88:36.52]The guard laughs softly.
[88:40.24]Very well.
[88:41.64]I see you are modest, if impolite.
[88:45.07]My reward is to answer one question.
[88:48.15]But I am the god of Grace, and I require my followers to show Grace.
[88:53.45]And you have not.
[88:55.29]I can see all, remember.
[88:57.70]I am a god.
[88:59.16]and I can see that you have committed murder, a performer in the fair, so I deny you my aid as you denied others their lives.
[89:09.61]His voice rises from a gentle whisper to a rolling thunder that echoes the walls.
[89:15.41]Now leave, or I will repay you in kind.
[89:24.18]Fair.
[89:25.31]He knows.
[89:27.05]The jig is up.
[89:28.59]It's up.
[89:31.41]It's up.
[89:34.95]I've murdered too many people.
[89:38.34]I love how he specifically calls out the guy with the green hair.
[89:42.18]That performer, right?
[89:44.00]Oh, I can't believe you've committed murder.
[89:46.44]The green-haired wig performer in that fair that time.
[89:50.75]Let alone the two homeless guys you killed.
[89:55.70]No, I care about the performer.
[89:57.04]I care about the green hair.
[90:01.30]Argue.
[90:01.64]I gotta plead my case.
[90:03.99]You deny me my right, you declare.
[90:06.83]The god's voice lifts in a roar of anger.
[90:08.83]I deny you everything, he rages.
[90:13.73]And then the idol moves, standing gracefully onto its two legs and leaning forward.
[90:22.31]Freeze.
[90:23.29]Before you can react, the statue of Koga plants a mechanical kiss on your forehead.
[90:28.15]You hear the... But you do not feel the sting of the poison dart as it enters your skin and burrows into your brain.
[90:38.44]Your honor, I plead the fifth.
[90:40.06]Listen to me, son.
[90:42.56]I'm your dad.
[90:44.98]Destroy him!
[90:47.38]Freeze.
[90:48.40]Whoa!
[90:48.76]I don't know.
[90:50.67]It could have been a big test.
[90:53.00]Oh, boy, we got a lot of... We got YeruYeru with the subscription.
[90:58.88]Thanks, Yeru.
[91:00.34]And then we got GGGGBabyBaby with 1500 bits.
[91:04.39]Damn, thanks for that, man.
[91:05.91]That's a lot.

[91:09.61]I highly appreciate it.
[91:10.73]Thanks for the support, dude.
[91:13.18]WaffenShopper... Your name is hard to pronounce.
[91:16.08]I'm gonna call you Waff.
[91:17.64]Thanks for the 100 bits.
[91:18.42]Jerma, Jesus.
[91:20.40]Killer Cream Star with 80 bits.
[91:23.67]Thank you.
[91:25.23]Javelin YT with 100.
[91:26.51]Thanks a lot, dude.
[91:28.25]And Grandmaster Engineering with a couple hundreds.
[91:31.39]And then McKenzie44 with a subscription.
[91:33.17]Thank you, guys.
[91:35.35]I got wrecked.
[91:35.95]I did.
[91:37.24]So that's death number 7.
[91:39.22]So is there no... Alright, let's rewind back to the fair.
[91:44.00]Where's the fair?
[91:45.66]Let's go back like 6 hours.
[91:48.24]Yeah, let's just like go over here.
[91:52.90]He's talking about here.
[91:55.24]Right here, right?
[91:58.50]No, no, no.
[91:59.12]Where is it?
[91:59.52]Let's see how far.
[92:00.50]There it is.
[92:03.08]This is where he's talking about.
[92:10.78]Oh, boy.
[92:11.26]Another 50.
[92:12.62]GGG.
[92:14.32]1500 again.
[92:16.10]Damn, dude.
[92:16.70]Thanks.
[92:16.96]That's a lot.
[92:20.06]Thank you.
[92:20.76]Have a burger.
[92:21.93]I definitely will.
[92:24.83]No way.
[92:26.99]Yeah, that's like six hours ago.
[92:29.23]No way.
[92:31.89]Misclick.
[92:32.40]Holy shit.
[92:33.12]That would be horrible.
[92:33.80]I would just leave.
[92:34.86]I would like to play a different game right now.
[92:39.46]So I'm not sure all the time to get here too.
[92:42.73]There's got to be some weird thing I can do to him.
[92:45.25]Right?
[92:45.99]Like, okay.
[92:47.91]So that's seven deaths.
[92:55.71]No, I... I leave.
[93:02.44]But ask Korrigor a question.
[93:03.46]Let's see.
[93:04.14]Korrigor, you begin.
[93:04.78]I come to ask a question.
[93:05.84]You trail off the statue.
[93:06.68]It's just a statue.
[93:07.22]It makes no response.
[93:10.02]No, I'm out of here.
[93:10.76]There's nothing I can do.
[93:11.59]Can I steal something on the way out?
[93:13.11]Should have fucking stolen something.
[93:20.38]Steal something.
[93:21.04]1500 is only 15 bucks.
[93:22.68]Well, 1500 two times is 30, which is... That's a lot.
[93:33.57]Make a weird scream at him.
[93:35.75]Yeah, it's time to go.
[93:38.81]Rewind to steal.
[93:39.95]I mean, I guess I could do that, right?
[93:47.06]You know, fuck this guy.
[93:49.16]Like, I died.
[93:50.22]I technically have... Let's steal.
[93:52.63]Let's go.
[93:53.01]Let's steal from this idiot.
[93:55.11]You're a god, huh?
[93:56.43]Go inside.
[93:57.43]Oh, shit.
[93:58.03]I've rebounded back to the snake.
[94:00.25]Oh, shit.
[94:02.39]Overpower him.
[94:08.13]Yeah, I did it again.
[94:09.15]Yeah, we'll go... I'm gonna steal from him.
[94:18.28]So you won't give me your Grace?
[94:19.61]That's fine.
[94:20.07]I'll just take something precious.
[94:22.63]The temple is cluttered with so many valuable artifacts, it's hard to decide where to begin.
[94:26.65]There are sculptures, plates, candlesticks, and shields of solid gold.
[94:30.23]A table covered with a silk cloth holds a crystal decanter and four golden goblets.
[94:35.25]In another corner, a fountain showers out an endless stream of diamonds and small jewels.
[94:41.43]Take a handful of jewels.
[94:42.95]You go over to the fountain, gazing in wonderment at the sparkling splendor that issues from its spout.
[94:47.36]You can simply put your pack underneath the stream, open, and make enough money to hire an army to take with you to Mampang.
[94:53.14]You take a fistful of the jewels, but then you freeze.
[94:55.88]The humming sound of the temple has become louder, and you have a strong sense that something is watching you.
[95:02.28]Turn around and look.
[95:03.17]You turn around, you gaze, see nothing, but wait a moment.
[95:05.37]Weren't there four stone demons up in the rafters above the altar before?
[95:10.98]The gargoyles are flapping in the air above you.
[95:13.47]They are still stone, but now their jaws are working and their teeth snap in the air in front of their faces.
[95:19.77]Cast a spell.
[95:21.09]You begin ready to spell, but the creatures know a sorcerer when they see one.
[95:23.73]In moments, one has died for your right arm and with a single bite, severs it clean away.
[95:29.44]Oh, no.
[95:33.50]No, rewinds.
[95:34.96]You look down in horror.
[95:36.28]You will not be able to cast any more spells.
[95:41.43]wield your sword well how do I die I gotta die the guard girls hover back a little perhaps hoping that the punishment is no dude dude I can't run
[96:06.85]Ray screaming from the shrine into the cold night air and the ziggurat not stopping until you are halfway to the ground.
[96:11.71]That's when the hurt of your injury begins to set in.
[96:25.59]How do I die?
[96:26.49]Throw myself off the edge.
[96:27.99]How do I fucking throw myself off the edge?
[96:33.12]How do I throw myself off the edge?
[96:39.32]Where's my bag of jewels?
[96:41.11]I'm gonna have to have goblins fight for me.
[96:47.17]Hold on a minute, treasure.
[96:49.11]Fistful of gems, but what do I do with this shit?
[96:52.81]I'm your dad!
[96:57.14]I'm going to die.
[96:57.76]I have to die.
[97:02.22]Thank you.
[97:02.64]Give him the zap.
[97:03.96]I have one arm.
[97:04.70]I can't cast any more spells and I'm useless with the sword.
[97:09.34]No rewinds.
[97:10.70]That's the way it is.
[97:12.76]Unless I fall down these steps.
[97:14.92]I'm going to try every second for the next minute.
[97:17.34]I'm going to try to throw myself down these stairs.
[97:21.71]You climb back down.
[97:22.55]It's easier.
[97:23.45]Halfway down you pause to rest.
[97:24.49]Your arm is throbbing painfully and you keep it pressed against your body to staunch the flow of blood.
[97:31.33]You've seen enough.
[97:31.93]You climb quickly back down the steps and you trace your... Oh, fuck.
[97:36.71]No.
[97:39.01]No.
[97:44.47]Take a break and look at the view.
[97:55.10]The mud underfoot is stamped with footprints and in between them the prints of many paws You're leaving a trail of blood behind you as you stagger away from the ziggurat I'm definitely gonna die, right?
[98:13.07]Crap Fuck dude
[98:20.46]You walk between clawing trees and thick bushes.
[98:22.51]The north gate is finally in sight.
[98:24.35]You can see its imposing, ornately carved wooden doors over the top of the guard huts and low buildings that lie at the end of this road.
[98:32.73]Look at the guard huts.
[98:34.91]My word.
[98:42.71]You walk between clawing trees and thick bushes.
[98:45.04]Yeah, you pause to watch the guard huts.
[98:47.52]They seem quite still.
[98:49.04]One has a hole in its roof.
[98:50.76]Weed grows through the chimney of another.
[98:52.39]Are they abandoned?
[98:53.83]Your injured arm feels very strange.
[98:58.25]Nurse it.
[99:00.61]You take a moment to look down at your arm, but though you expect to see nothing but a stump, your hand is there.
[99:07.27]It seems that having it bitten off completely was in fact an illusion.
[99:10.83]Now you are out of Korg's reach.
[99:12.63]The illusion has faded.
[99:13.77]Oh, thank goodness.
[99:17.06]Perhaps even the gargoyles themselves were illusions as well.
[99:20.43]But the treasure you have taken is not, and it will be very valuable if you can find a trader to sell it to.
[99:27.59]Oh, yes.
[99:28.99]It worked.
[99:32.80]Everybody was freaking out.
[99:33.96]Turns out that was what I did.
[99:38.30]But between here and there is a long road, lined by thick and gloomy trees, a patch of wild forest like you haven't seen since the hills.
[99:46.33]What a twist.
[99:49.09]Thank you, Abbott J. Thank you, Mr. Peanut.
[99:51.59]And Maher598.
[99:52.57]Thank you for your bits.
[99:57.60]Praise the dolphin.
[99:59.58]No, I still got the dolphin with me.
[100:03.60]Go back and steal more.
[100:07.30]We did it, Reddit.
[100:11.84]Let's just go cautiously.
[100:16.17]Being an idiot paid off.
[100:17.27]Nice work.
[100:23.71]So, we played swindle-sweens.
[100:27.43]You make your way slowly forward, trying to ensure your feet do not crunch too loudly on the gravel.
[100:32.11]Something catches your eye.
[100:33.67]Movement in the shadows on both sides of the road.
[100:36.15]Torchlight.
[100:38.31]Call out, hey, who's that?
[100:40.61]Something emerges from the side of the path, a wolf clad in tight metal armor.
[100:44.29]No, a werewolf.
[100:46.13]No matter, you have defeated werewolves before.
[100:52.06]Ready a spell.
[100:54.00]You open your mind to the patterns of the stars above, but just as the last moment, you freeze.
[100:58.53]One werewolf you could probably defeat with a spell, but suddenly there are more.
[101:02.59]10, 20, 30 werewolves pad down from the shadows onto the path, forming an arc in front of you.
[101:08.77]This is a retinue.
[101:13.15]I'll take on all fucking 30 of you.
[101:20.81]Is this where you turn and run?
[101:29.01]I'm going to leave this one up to you guys.
[101:31.27]Wait, what?
[101:32.97]This one is up to you guys.
[101:35.43]What path am I going to take down here?
[101:36.95]Running, waiting, or just yelling at them?
[101:47.53]Run, threaten, or wait.
[101:56.04]There you go.
[101:57.87]Here's the poll.
[101:59.53]Go for it.
[102:05.83]Make them dance.
[102:06.61]I do have that.
[102:08.31]Yeah, I still have that.
[102:10.82]Fight, you fool!
[102:16.12]Alright, I love this poll for one very important reason.
[102:20.48]I love how run...
[102:22.95]It's like, there's only like 37, 30, like 40 votes for run right now.
[102:27.31]Like, get out of there, run.
[102:28.65]It's actually probably not a bad idea.
[102:37.18]Run.
[102:39.96]Wait and threaten are fairly close.
[102:46.28]Although threaten seems to have fallen off.
[102:52.20]Cast the new spell.
[102:53.80]Can I?
[102:57.08]Make a dance party?
[103:00.91]Pray to the elephant.
[103:01.67]The elephant was useless.
[103:07.77]Alright, we're gonna... I mean, it's still fairly close.
[103:12.81]Fly, you fool.
[103:16.41]Thanks, Moffin.
[103:24.26]10 seconds.
[103:29.03]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
[103:36.35]Alright, looks like we're waiting.
[103:38.97]We're going to wait and see what these 30 werewolves do.
[103:41.26]Okay.
[103:43.40]Ball is now closed.
[103:45.12]Wait wins.
[103:48.06]Wait.
[103:48.24]Wait.
[103:50.48]You wait, tensed and ready to run if necessary.
[103:52.98]Then you notice a man stepping from the tree line beyond.
[103:56.12]Who goes there?
[103:56.90]He demands.
[103:57.64]Friend or foe?
[103:58.44]I mean, look, I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[104:03.72]If I was staring at 30 werewolves and they asked me if I was friend or foe, I'm going to say friend.
[104:14.19]Friend.
[104:15.15]The man does not respond.
[104:16.19]It is clear he is waiting for something, but for what?
[104:22.92]Please, I need to pass.
[104:23.96]Stand aside or I will kill you.
[104:25.12]What proof do you require?
[104:26.02]I know Vic.
[104:27.38]Vic for First Noble.
[104:36.31]Vic for First Noble.
[104:41.41]Stand aside or I will kill you.
[104:46.49]Vic for First Noble.
[104:48.35]Vic 2016.
[104:49.85]I was going to yell that, yeah.
[104:54.08]Hopefully that's the right one.
[104:55.86]It has to be one of these.
[104:59.26]Vic for First Noble.
[105:00.98]The man sighs a huge sigh of relief.
[105:03.28]Well met, friend.
[105:04.46]He answers, Vic for First Noble.
[105:08.69]Alright.
[105:10.13]See ya.
[105:11.17]See you around.
[105:11.81]It's been nice knowing you.
[105:12.99]Thank you.
[105:15.89]Ask him about Vic.
[105:17.61]Hey, what's Vic been up to these days, you know?
[105:20.75]Leading the charge, the man replies proudly.
[105:23.41]Walking to the council building.
[105:25.31]The wolves following a decent way behind.
[105:27.72]He wants to show he is not afraid to stand alone.
[105:34.56]He's a brave guy.
[105:37.70]He's what the city needs, the man agrees.
[105:39.90]A strong hand, a passionate one.
[105:41.96]With that, he whistles to his wolves and sweeps away to the night.
[105:45.33]You breathe a heavy sigh of relief.
[105:48.97]The werewolves want Vic.
[105:52.34]Now, if I remember correctly, I got to this point before, a long time ago, and something, something, like, I won't even, I'm not going to tell you what happens.
[106:02.41]I know what happens here, though, because I've gotten here before.
[106:05.48]Through other circumstances in the past.
[106:08.12]You have reached the north gate.
[106:10.38]The ground before it is wide and clear and lit by blazing torches set into brackets either side of the enormous sealed doors.
[106:17.24]Should there be archers hiding in the shadows, they would have a clear sight on you.
[106:22.30]Off to one side is a well, but there's no other cover.
[106:26.09]You don't know any of the spell lines, of course, but perhaps the gate will open to a dump spell.
[106:34.21]Cheater.
[106:36.09]Wait, what?
[106:39.23]Can you make a brand new word?
[106:43.08]Let's just see what happens.
[106:45.41]DOP is definitely not going to work.
[106:51.36]Sense danger.
[106:52.88]DOP.
[106:54.86]Listen to the door.
[106:58.95]Force field.
[107:00.89]Misspelled zap.
[107:06.29]Find safe passage.
[107:11.06]Is Vic the depressed guy who burned down his library after you burned his door and harassed his pet?
[107:15.56]No, that was... That was Lorag.
[107:22.95]Fast forward through the gate.
[107:27.79]Let's humor the game here.
[107:28.85]Dopp.
[107:31.79]You stay in the shadows and try to dop spell.
[107:34.51]You do not expect it to work.
[107:35.89]The door is wizard locked after all, but it's worth a try while you still have time.
[107:39.65]You complete the magic and focus on the door, but nothing happens.
[107:42.35]No tumblers turn, no hinges creak.
[107:44.23]There is not even the slightest hint of bending wood.
[107:47.14]It is as if the door cannot hear your magic.
[107:51.56]Walk to the gate.
[107:52.36]Throwing caution to the wind, you step out of the shadows and approach the gate.
[107:55.46]Time to see how good your lockpicking skills are.
[108:01.09]Doo-doo.
[108:04.52]You reach the other side of the clearing unscathed and stand below the enormous doors.
[108:11.33]To start the next game.
[108:17.83]Recite the spell.
[108:18.81]I'm ready.
[108:20.93]You knock firmly on the door.
[108:22.34]When there is no response, you call out, I am here to open this gate.
[108:27.86]There is no response.
[108:29.52]You begin to wonder if you have been tricked or if there is no gate here at all, and this is simply an illusion painted across a solid stone wall.
[108:37.16]Suddenly, you are not alone.
[108:38.28]A phantom voice issues from the wood itself.
[108:41.84]Halt, stranger, it booms.
[108:43.91]Do you know the spell which controls the gate?
[108:48.67]I do.
[108:49.79]I do not.
[108:50.43]I do, you reply.
[108:53.41]Perhaps you can bluff your way through not knowing any of the lines.
[109:00.63]Then I await your command, the voice booms.
[109:02.91]From across the clearing you hear a scrabbling sound of metal on stone, but there is no time for that now.
[109:09.11]By corkish Grace and something's pride, open sesame.
[109:13.29]Vic for first noble.
[109:17.74]Open sesame.
[109:21.18]Vic.
[109:24.17]Vic for First Noble, you declare.
[109:26.83]Something is definitely moving in the corner of the clearing.
[109:29.55]Something coming for you with blades and claws and teeth.
[109:35.04]By Korg's Grace and something's pride, you stand back to see what effect your lines have had.
[109:40.10]The voice has gone silent.
[109:43.73]Uh, wait.
[109:45.41]You wait impatiently to see what will happen, then the voice booms out.
[109:49.28]Incorrect.
[109:50.64]This door is sealed.
[109:52.90]There is no time for another guess.
[109:54.90]From behind you comes the sound of feet and swords.
[109:58.12]You turn, expecting to see the guard, but instead a horde of goblins has appeared as if out of nowhere and is charging across the dust towards you.
[110:07.31]Stand by, Grom.
[110:09.66]You stand your ground by the gate.
[110:11.08]At the first of the goblin's approaches, you reach out with your sword, and the two of you collide into battle.
[110:18.44]Cut him down.
[110:21.32]I can go full blast pretty much every time.
[110:23.10]This guy's not going to get one hit on me.
[110:26.27]Yeah.
[110:26.87]Dead.
[110:29.29]You've defeated the goblin.
[110:30.41]Alright.
[110:32.52]You wipe your sword, spinning about to take on the next goblin, but the others have raced around you, heading straight for the gate.
[110:38.54]And in their midst, a small figure is being propelled forward.
[110:42.21]You cannot clearly see him, but he's wearing a dull metal circlet on his brow, which he clutches as though it was keeping him safe.
[110:49.19]Their king, perhaps.
[110:50.83]But since when have goblins had a king?
[110:53.24]He's surrounded by a guard of nearly 20 goblins, as though he was indeed precious.
[110:59.13]Kill him.
[111:00.57]Kill the figure.
[111:09.35]No.
[111:10.97]I'll try to kill him.
[111:12.19]Whoever this Goblin King is, he needs to be stopped.
[111:18.61]Alright, guys.
[111:21.57]You know the drill.
[111:23.79]Oh, there's no zap this zip.
[111:27.08]Oh, what?
[111:28.30]I can't do zap?
[111:30.22]Hot.
[111:31.64]I can throw a fireball at him.
[111:33.78]What else can I do?
[111:34.32]Let's be cautious here.
[111:35.46]Hold on.
[111:38.00]Yob, summon a giant.
[111:39.26]Don't have a giant's tooth.
[111:48.79]We've cheated.
[111:50.21]No!
[111:55.14]Wait, what about like explosions?
[112:00.78]Good enough I'm gonna regret this I'm gonna regret this
[112:20.04]Cast the spell, weaving a fireball about your fist, which you hurl with careful aim at the figure by the gate.
[112:25.99]One moment he is there, the next he has erupted into a flash of fire and smoke.
[112:32.39]The goblins roar with anger.
[112:34.27]It seems their king was the only way to open the gate.
[112:37.15]They are beginning to try and form a ladder of their own bodies.
[112:43.06]But the wall is high, and they are clumsy creatures."
[112:51.04]I'm gonna cut through the gate.
[112:52.30]I'm gonna cut through the gate.
[112:54.10]Let's fucking cast another fireball.
[112:56.97]Oh, shit.
[112:57.57]Oh, fuck.
[113:00.65]You forgive me?
[113:08.05]You begin to weave the spell.
[113:09.21]The force of it builds within you, and only then do you realize the awful truth.
[113:13.47]You are too weak to control it.
[113:15.45]Ethereal energies stare through your veins, and the world goes black as the magic turns inward, consuming the last of your spirit before turning on your flesh, leaving you with nothing but an empty skeleton.
[113:29.02]What's my fate?
[113:29.98]You have been consumed by magic.
[113:32.88]Death.
[113:38.05]Like, how much red do you see?
[113:41.75]How much red is too hot?
[113:44.44]You just see red.
[113:45.84]Guy walking up with a bunch of goblins.
[113:47.80]I'm gonna fucking murder that guy with a fireball.
[113:50.04]Goblins are trying to get over the gate.
[113:51.52]I don't even care.
[113:52.12]I'm gonna cast a fireball and die.
[113:55.54]You are just consumed by rage at that point.
[114:03.48]Alright, let's do it again.
[114:06.64]That's death number seven.
[114:09.93]You've reached the other side of the clearing unscathed.
[114:12.97]What a terrible... Did you die?
[114:14.27]I don't know the spell.
[114:18.60]Yeah, recite the spell.
[114:20.10]I don't know the spell.
[114:22.84]The voice begins to laugh.
[114:25.22]Then the gate denies you.
[114:26.22]The voice replies.
[114:28.10]Kill the king again with a different spell.
[114:33.63]Jervison is a pretty good... Makes sense right now.
[114:38.76]From across the clearing, you hear a scrabbling sound of metal over stone.
[114:40.88]You look around and see nothing.
[114:44.39]Look above the shadows on the wall.
[114:47.49]You gaze into the shadows by the wall, expecting from the sound to see guardsmen sneaking along and dragging the points of their swords across the stones behind them, but there is nothing there.
[114:56.17]Here come the goblins.
[114:57.65]It bears its leering, hook-toothed smile of a goblin.
[115:00.35]The creature is climbing a rope with a grappling hook attached, which is hooked over the lip of the well.
[115:07.21]Did he just punch him in the face as he's coming up the well?
[115:11.25]No, I'm gonna die again.
[115:12.59]I'm gonna die again.
[115:13.23]No, I'm running.
[115:15.65]You turn to run, aiming to find somewhere you can hide and watch what unfolds.
[115:20.23]But then you realize that you are running for your life as goblin after goblin clamors from the well and begins to race across the clearing towards you.
[115:26.89]There's no way you can fight a hundred goblins, so you dash aside into the shadows.
[115:33.44]The goblins pour up to the gate.
[115:34.76]They are trying to ram it.
[115:36.79]But then they stop and in the midst a small figure is being propelled.
[115:39.79]Oh, it must be the king of the goblins.
[115:41.77]Should we kill him?
[115:45.42]No, I'm hanging back.
[115:47.47]You hang back watching as the figure nears the gate.
[115:50.10]Leaning down to the lock, he whispers something that you cannot hear what he says.
[115:53.94]A moment later, the gate begins to move.
[115:57.04]It is opening.
[115:59.19]Run for the open gate.
[116:02.31]Did I just sprint through the gate and beat it?
[116:14.16]Piece of shit.
[116:16.00]I'm just gonna sprint through the gate.
[116:18.18]Run for the gate.
[116:19.28]This is your chance to leave the city.
[116:20.62]You rush forwards, waving your sword madly to clear a path through the goblins.
[116:25.18]You are nearly through when suddenly a great cry goes up from outside the walls.
[116:30.24]Something is moving out there.
[116:32.16]Cheat run.
[116:33.10]You keep pelting madly forward, for once simply running madly and not waiting to look around.
[116:37.59]You are almost through the gates when you see what is out there.
[116:40.17]An army of marsh goblins.
[116:42.41]Thousands of them.
[116:43.67]fully armed and stampeding into Kare.
[116:50.12]Dropped to his side of the gate.
[116:52.94]In the last moment before the invading army crashes through the open gate, you drop to one side, pressing yourself breathless against the stone.
[116:59.40]The invading army, marsh goblins, storm through, filling the clearing and meeting their hill cousins in a loud and violent celebration.
[117:07.41]The man with the circlet at the gate cries with a glee, A new day for Kare begins, he cries, clambering onto the shadows of a nearby goblin, as though about to make a speech onto the shoulders.
[117:18.75]Quite suddenly, the goblins that are carrying him let go.
[117:21.53]He cries out as he falls to the ground.
[117:24.33]A sword goes up.
[117:26.21]Slashing down, there is a scream.
[117:30.11]They have murdered their own king.
[117:32.00]This guy died twice.
[117:35.20]What is going on here?
[117:36.64]The circlet from his head rolls to your feet.
[117:39.08]The goblins clashing sword on shield look towards the city with violent eyes.
[117:46.96]Take the circlet.
[117:50.21]I just... I'm... I could just fucking run for the gate.
[117:55.29]It's just total chaos.
[117:57.05]Circlet... I don't... I mean... Take the circlet?
[118:02.11]Does that make me the king?
[118:06.88]Take the circlet.
[118:08.26]From the way the king was clutching the circlet, you might have thought it was a thing of power, perhaps akin to the crown of kings itself.
[118:15.10]But it is nothing.
[118:16.44]Cheap, hammered iron.
[118:18.62]It still bears the groove from when it was once a goblin's sword.
[118:22.12]You toss it into the dust.
[118:26.06]Go for the gate.
[118:29.90]Their attack on Kari is not your concern.
[118:32.41]Darting forward through the crowd of creatures, you head for the open gate and the backlands.
[118:40.21]Run for the gate.
[118:42.70]I'm the new Goblin King.
[118:44.92]You run for the gate, but your progress is slow.
[118:46.96]Goblins are surging in, and they are starting to organize.
[118:50.86]One, a leader of some kind, is hoisted up by the others so he can address the crowd.
[118:56.11]Kari falls, he screams in his guttural voice, and every creature dies.
[119:03.42]suddenly goblin eyes are turning on you as if they had not seen you before one springs forward but there are a hundred more behind um draw my sword you ready your sword I'm gonna fight all hundred don't let a cheap crown stop you from being goblin king you'll see I'm gonna kill like 10 of them
[119:30.85]Shit.
[119:32.09]Oh, no.
[119:32.87]It's okay.
[119:33.39]I can full blast again.
[119:34.19]He won't full blast me, I don't think.
[119:36.69]Fuck, he's gonna full blast me.
[119:39.15]Damn it, I knew it!
[119:44.57]Shit, I'm dead.
[119:47.09]I'm dead.
[119:47.59]I'm dead.
[119:48.03]Pray to the goblin.
[119:49.13]No, pray to the dolphin.
[119:50.57]Pray.
[119:52.93]Pray to the goblin.
[119:54.71]Defend.
[120:00.42]Defend.
[120:01.56]Good.
[120:06.40]Let's just go barely above where he can swing.
[120:09.50]Come on.
[120:10.06]Really?
[120:10.44]Three defenses in a row from this idiot?
[120:14.53]Shit.
[120:18.91]I have to kill this thing.
[120:19.83]Let's go with six.
[120:24.99]Oh my god.
[120:31.89]4.4 and 4.3.
[120:32.45]You little shit.
[120:41.04]Why is it so difficult for me right now?
[120:47.40]I just did that.
[120:47.92]There's a hundred more.
[120:49.18]Alright, I'm not dead.
[120:57.87]You're dead.
[120:58.75]Die.
[121:01.78]You forced yourself across the yard, you defeated the goblin.
[121:03.72]Got him.
[121:05.59]Another goblin is charging forward.
[121:11.13]Alright, another goblin is charging forward, eager for your blood.
[121:14.15]Oh, just kidding.
[121:14.73]He was like holding, he was defending, he was holding his hands up.
[121:20.53]I'm dead.
[121:21.98]Game over.
[121:23.34]Bye.
[121:25.38]Dead.
[121:28.20]Pray to the goblin.
[121:28.94]Let's death and raid.
[121:31.06]Wait, what?
[121:34.37]Oh, shit.
[121:37.99]Alright, another goblin is charging forward, eager for your blood.
[121:40.51]That means he's going to defend?
[121:42.61]Bullshit.
[121:49.14]Yeah, apparently that means he's going to defend.
[121:50.52]Instead of your footing, deliver a fast-cutting attack, aiming to connect... It paces away, shaking with terror.
[121:57.46]The monster growls and hisses.
[121:59.54]I think I can do a full blast here.
[122:00.86]Yep.
[122:02.32]Dead.
[122:03.96]Chasing the creature, you bring your sword up and attempt to sever its neck.
[122:06.38]You've defeated the goblin.
[122:08.62]Flawless.
[122:09.12]Alright.
[122:09.52]More goblins are appearing on all sides.
[122:14.95]Do I have to keep fighting?
[122:18.17]You've got to run for it at this point, right?
[122:20.81]I mean, it's very clear.
[122:21.79]I'm running.
[122:26.33]You cannot keep this up.
[122:27.38]Wave after wave of goblin is filling the yard.
[122:29.72]You cannot help to kill them all with gesture your sword.
[122:32.22]You turn and race away into the shadows.
[122:35.06]Then a voice rings out.
[122:36.88]Stop!
[122:37.74]There is a better way.
[122:38.90]I'm going to look for the speaker.
[122:43.24]You look around but can see no one, but all around you something is happening.
[122:47.17]It is as though the goblins have slowed down, their warmongering becoming an absurd stately dance.
[122:53.21]The noise in the clearing dulls to a low mumble.
[122:56.74]I command you to stop, the voice cries, and suddenly you feel yourself held rigid.
[123:01.71]From the smoke of the torches by the gate, a figure emerges.
[123:06.29]Let's look at him.
[123:07.57]It's an old man with a long beard and deep black irised eyes.
[123:11.87]He paces through the churning goblin army to stand in the open.
[123:15.40]His legs disappear into a spectral trail.
[123:18.24]He is at least part wraith.
[123:20.50]Step forward, he commands, and you find yourself bitten.
[123:25.68]Approach the figure.
[123:28.62]The goblins seem to part around you like smoke as you approach the figure.
[123:33.16]I have aligned three stars, the ghostly man declares.
[123:37.28]Vik rises tonight.
[123:39.06]The goblins show their hand tonight.
[123:41.41]But also you.
[123:43.29]You are here tonight.
[123:45.61]Suddenly you recognize his face.
[123:47.91]It is Lorag the Scholar.
[123:50.75]We meet again, he says.
[123:52.87]It has not been long for you.
[123:55.49]For me, it has been centuries upon centuries.
[123:59.13]I have founded a city, and now I intend to save it.
[124:04.76]Really?
[124:05.20]Does he not remember me burning his house down?
[124:07.86]Oh, no, his grave.
[124:09.58]I met him at his grave.
[124:10.72]I, like, saw his face.
[124:13.81]I need to leave this city.
[124:17.64]So you have been searching for the spell lines, he replies.
[124:20.94]I know.
[124:22.00]It is the task I have laid out for you.
[124:27.86]Don't you know the spell?
[124:29.11]Find them yourself.
[124:29.91]Why do you need me?
[124:31.79]Zap him.
[124:35.19]Lorag the Depressed.
[124:39.75]The gate's already open.
[124:42.87]The goblins opened it.
[124:43.73]Their leader did.
[124:46.04]The figure slowly shakes his head.
[124:48.26]The spell does not open the gate.
[124:50.74]His tone is heavy and dark, like tarred timber.
[124:54.76]The spell controls it.
[124:57.87]And there are deep magics burned into the wood itself.
[125:01.57]Magics that have poisoned the city and burnt fire into the eyeballs of those who live nearby.
[125:07.76]He stares at you, his cold black eyes expressing no emotion.
[125:11.81]Deep magics I place there to be used by you tonight.
[125:16.57]I am dead.
[125:17.67]You must act for me.
[125:23.43]How can I find the spell lines?
[125:25.09]And if I refuse, the gates open.
[125:31.66]How can I find them?
[125:35.22]How can I find this magic, you ask?
[125:36.78]I've traveled the city and learned nothing.
[125:39.20]The wizard nods.
[125:40.34]Well, I could have probably.
[125:41.82]The lines are known to four nobles.
[125:44.24]Lord Shinva is dead, but not yet forgotten.
[125:47.16]In his mausoleum in the necropolis, Lord Molas was a follower of the god Slang.
[125:53.61]And in his shrine near the docks of Lower Kare, you may learn his line.
[125:57.91]As for my line, I will give it to you freely.
[126:01.71]Tumblers too sealed deep inside.
[126:05.68]The spell lines you have found are listed in the key section of your inventory.
[126:10.38]I have no stomach for your quest, but there is no more time.
[126:13.22]I will go back.
[126:18.28]Slang.
[126:24.41]There's no more time.
[126:27.47]But there is no more time, you insist.
[126:28.97]It's too late.
[126:30.53]There is a magic, Lorag replies, that will give you the time you need.
[126:35.16]I cast it once on myself and went far back to before the city was built.
[126:40.02]I found it, Kare.
[126:41.46]Now you will save it.
[126:44.20]He waits to let those words sink in.
[126:46.55]If you will allow me, he says, I will bend time itself so that you may return to the city and find the spell for the gate.
[126:54.51]So, shall you take the adventure, or will you leave Kare to burn?
[127:00.27]Understand also, I will curse you and the journey to follow if you do not assist me.
[127:07.49]You hesitate.
[127:08.89]Kare is a city of traps, but also of secrets, and there is still more that you might find.
[127:14.14]Can you afford to let the city port burn?
[127:25.98]Do we... Do we get out of here?
[127:28.32]Do we leave car?
[127:30.50]No rewinds.
[127:35.47]Don't let him rewind you.
[127:39.85]That's true.
[127:41.25]He will be letting me rewind.
[127:42.79]No rewinds.
[127:44.94]The city burns.
[127:47.64]No rewinds.
[127:55.18]Oh, that makes me laugh.
[127:57.06]No rewinds.
[127:58.18]I can conjure a spell that will let you rewind and go back.
[128:03.78]Sorry, dude.
[128:04.75]Sorry, Lorag.
[128:05.89]No rewinds.
[128:10.89]Sorry, Lorag.
[128:11.53]No rewinds.
[128:13.03]What the hell are you talking about?
[128:14.49]No rewinds.
[128:16.96]This is life and death.
[128:18.28]A city will burn.
[128:20.31]No rewinds.
[128:21.89]What?
[128:22.27]This isn't a game.
[128:23.59]This is not a game.
[128:24.73]Where are you going?
[128:26.13]Where?
[128:28.69]I'm sorry, you declare solemnly.
[128:31.31]No rewinds.
[128:33.15]Lorag seems to shrink a little from your will.
[128:36.25]Then, he says, I will help you travel past the wall of Kare.
[128:41.02]Then you may watch its fires burn from safety and see what your selfishness has wrought.
[128:46.84]But I will come with you as a curse.
[128:50.18]There is nothing for me here.
[128:53.74]You feel the elephant drifting further than you have ever before as another spirit takes its place.
[128:59.92]The wizard is somehow entering your very soul.
[129:03.55]The ghost wizard raises a finger embossed with a dark green ring and points at you.
[129:08.33]A moment later, you are somewhere else, the other side of the gate.
[129:18.14]Lorag is my new god.
[129:21.04]Lorag is the ghost of a long-dead wizard and the founder of Kare.
[129:24.40]His curse has made him into your god.
[129:26.85]You feel his sneering and his cold contempt.
[129:31.89]Lorag shakes his head in your mind, content to let you suffer for now.
[129:36.66]Lorag is my new friend.
[129:38.46]Lorag the god.
[129:43.06]No rewinds, man.
[129:47.60]So let me explain something very quickly.
[129:53.26]Because I've played through this game before, here's what's going on.
[129:58.61]So if you get to the gate and you don't know all the spells, the game essentially tells you, okay...
[130:06.83]You didn't do it.
[130:07.75]You didn't learn all the secrets.
[130:08.97]You didn't get all the four spell lines.
[130:10.99]But we will let you do it again.
[130:12.82]Essentially, when you get to this point, you can kind of play through the whole game again.
[130:17.98]So it rewinds you essentially back to before none of this ever happened.
[130:25.85]And you can kind of explore places you didn't explore before.
[130:30.75]So that's in place to just, you know, if you want to be, like, be, like, do it, like, the correct way.
[130:37.36]I actually, I don't even remember if I did it the correct way last time.
[130:42.20]I think Lorag was with me last time, too.
[130:48.57]I played in, like, 2012.
[130:51.29]But there's a whole area up here you can do.
[130:53.11]And for those of you that are watching and that you're going to play...
[130:57.80]Like you've seen throughout the course of this, like going through here and up here.
[131:01.75]There's a lot more to see.
[131:03.13]There's a lot more to do.
[131:04.93]And I'd actually rather not kind of be a completionist and try to do every single thing.
[131:10.87]Because if you guys play, you can do something completely different.
[131:15.61]You know what I mean?
[131:18.25]Shut those cats up.
[131:23.85]But yeah, that's part two.
[131:28.17]Don't you ever talk to me or my son again.
[131:32.89]So on to the back lens.
[131:34.24]I now have the Curse of Lorag.
[131:40.34]You've never had one ration?
[131:42.04]Rations are actually very hard to keep and find because they get spoiled easily.
[131:46.56]They can get ruined by water and they're very expensive.
[131:50.81]So we're going into part three with one stamina, three gold, zero rations, and the Curse of Lorag.
[132:04.78]But for the purposes of this stream, we're going to keep going.
[132:09.70]We're going to keep going.
[132:10.40]We're going to move on to the Baklans.
[132:12.70]Because it's still fairly early.
[132:16.90]Easy game.
[132:17.72]Too many stamina.
[132:19.36]Rewind to Flanker.
[132:20.46]But that's the thing.
[132:24.04]I've never done that with Flanker before.
[132:26.02]I have no idea what that did.
[132:30.06]Or what that does.
[132:32.36]I don't remember what I did with him, but I know for certain I did not do that whole scenario.
[132:36.24]Without a doubt.
[132:39.24]Let's go.
[132:40.65]Outside Kare.
[132:47.07]The marsh goblins race into the city through the open gate, meeting their hill goblin cousins in raucous celebration.
[132:52.61]You see torches waving and swords clashing.
[132:57.84]Big celebration music for the city of Kare being taken over by goblins.
[133:04.83]Keep watching.
[133:06.15]More and more marsh goblins are streaming through the gate, as through the backlands, where a carcass split to reveal a host of maggots.
[133:13.37]Against such a force, no city could stand.
[133:15.51]Sure enough, you soon see the first rooftop ablaze.
[133:19.11]By morning, Kare will be no more.
[133:22.05]Are you happy, Analandr?
[133:23.91]murmurs Lorag in your mind.
[133:27.25]Turn and go.
[133:27.61]Most people sucked anyways.
[133:57.10]Let's keep going.
[134:00.36]Your journey across Kare is complete.
[134:01.94]In the course of your journey, you wiped out the debt of Flanker the Assassin, committed murder, destroyed the city port of Kare, and your spirit guide was replaced by the soul of Lorag the Wizard.
[134:12.66]You played one game of Swindlestones, which you won.
[134:16.01]You collected some magical artifacts, a large lump of beeswax, four goblin's teeth, a bracelet of bone, and a bamboo pipe.
[134:23.03]You are armed with a broadsword and your original sword, and have no rations and three gold pieces, and a spellbook.
[134:30.77]Continue.
[134:32.23]The adventure continues in Sorcery 3, The Seven Serpents.
[134:35.03]Out now.
[134:37.87]Of course it's out now.
[134:40.27]I need to... Is it a separate game?
[134:44.24]It might actually be a separate game.
[134:48.06]I might have to change games.
[134:49.20]Let's see.
[134:49.52]Is it?
[135:00.41]I believe it is a separate game.
[135:02.11]Let me see.
[135:06.22]I got it.
[135:06.60]Let me see.
[135:12.98]I'm looking at like the credits for part two.
[135:21.81]Okay.
[135:30.17]Alright.
[135:30.37]I'm going to start part three.
[135:31.65]I'm going to keep going here.
[135:36.13]This is an interesting watch.
[135:37.07]However, you need to zap more.
[135:38.89]There's plenty more things to zap.
[135:40.07]Don't worry.
[135:40.41]And then close this.
[135:46.99]Yeah, I got to open up the next game.
[135:48.52]Sorcery.
[135:53.21]We're not done.
[135:55.23]I'm going to at least start part three.
[135:57.33]Part three is going to start.
[135:59.12]I'm actually going to take a pee break as well, so I'll be right back.
[136:04.81]Let me just get it open.
[136:17.84]More cities to burn.
[136:19.24]And if for some reason my internet goes down, which it might, then we may have found a decent stopping point.
[136:27.36]Potentially.
[136:30.60]But yeah, it looks like I'm dropping frames again.
[136:33.76]The same times as last night.
[136:35.12]I don't know why.
[136:38.05]Well, if the stream goes down, like it might right now, because I'm dropping a bunch of frames, then have a good night.
[136:44.40]If it does, if we're still up, if my internet still is working when I get back, because it looks like it's not, then we will continue to part three.
[136:54.04]But like I said, it looks like it's done.
[137:12.87]I think we're still here, technically.
[137:32.68]Now, the same thing happened last night at sort of around the same time.
[137:35.79]I'm not sure why.
[137:38.07]But I guess I'm going to have to end it here.
[138:30.05]Yeah, it's bouncing all over the place.
[138:32.98]Strangely enough.
[138:34.20]It happened the same time last time.
[138:35.68]I don't know why this keeps happening.
[138:37.40]Last couple nights in a row.
[138:41.65]I can see, like, the amount of frames I'm dropping and how, uh... But, yeah.
