[01:24.53]Hi, guys.
[01:25.77]Hello.
[01:32.00]Ooh, Dark Souls 3.
[01:34.94]I'm not, you're not ready.
[01:41.33]What do you mean you're not ready?
[01:42.69]Not ready for what?
[01:46.37]Can't stay for too long, you gotta work well?
[01:49.47]Thanks for hanging out for as long as you can, I guess.
[01:52.63]Welcome.
[01:58.40]So today, we are going to turn this down a bit.
[02:05.42]Today we're going to play a couple of games, I think.
[02:07.48]Well, it depends on how much fun this one is, right?
[02:12.32]I've wanted to play this game for like
[02:15.47]At least a month.
[02:17.47]It just looked sort of interesting.
[02:18.79]And it looked like it might be fun and funny.
[02:20.29]I don't know.
[02:21.57]It's one of those old school games that came out like 15 years ago.
[02:24.74]We're just going to chill.
[02:27.32]This is off schedule.
[02:28.36]I just decided why not.
[02:30.20]I got some time right now.
[02:32.28]I got a couple hours at least.
[02:34.46]Why not, right?
[02:37.10]Hey, thank you Kirk for the sub.
[02:40.26]And thanks Roger Cheeto for the sub as well.
[02:44.53]I can actually see notifications now.
[02:48.47]This is probably going to be kind of loud.
[02:49.65]Thank you, Taco, for the two months.
[02:50.83]Hey, hey.
[02:52.19]Hey, hey.
[02:53.87]Let me switch over a couple of things.
[02:59.80]Turn this off.
[03:00.64]Let me see.
[03:01.22]This might be a little loud, so I apologize in advance.
[03:06.52]Is it?
[03:07.22]We'll see.
[03:07.96]I don't even know what resolution this is in.
[03:13.99]Yeah.
[03:14.31]It's fucking loud.
[03:16.74]I gotta- I can't even see the chat.
[03:18.02]What are we gonna do?
[03:21.54]What are we gonna do?
[03:23.04]What campaign?
[03:23.80]Light campaign or dark campaign?
[03:30.73]I told you.
[03:31.31]What did I tell you?
[03:33.03]I told you it was going to be loud.
[03:38.35]I turned it way down too.
[03:39.85]Holy shit.
[03:40.31]It's still that fucking loud.
[03:43.25]I'm putting it down to like 2%.
[03:44.07]There we go.
[03:48.15]Dark.
[03:49.31]Dark campaign.
[03:54.69]Dark, dark, dark.
[03:57.75]I'm seeing a lot of... I'm not seeing any light at all.
[04:01.87]We're gonna do dark campaign dark campaign this it's been settled We can't do the dark campaign.
[04:17.01]It's not okay.
[04:18.27]We have to do the light campaign oh
[04:19.94]Enclave?
[04:20.40]Enclave?
[04:20.64]Thought it was enclave.
[04:40.89]At that time, there were lands where the very essence of magic was believed to dwell, for they were lush and prosperous.
[04:48.11]Scripted?
[04:49.26]All who did not hold the secrets of the soil, which were protected by the Pact of Gifuro, coveted these lands fiercely.
[04:58.22]We're just chilling.
[04:59.36]We're just hanging out.
[05:00.10]This is not... ...among these envious creatures, for he believed that with the magic of these lands in his grasp... This game's probably going to be fun, you guys.
[05:07.19]...he would surely become invincible.
[05:10.09]And so he led his army to attack the dwellers of the land and lay claim to it for himself.
[05:17.36]The battle raged on and on until at last... Don't worry, I'm going to fix this.
[05:21.80]... stood alone against Vatar to protect the lands.
[05:24.40]Stood against fucking Darth Vader to perfect the lands.
[05:26.91]To perfect the lands.
[05:28.45]I can't even do my resolution settings yet.
[05:34.69]With a roar of anger and anguish, the wizard slammed his staff into the ground.
[05:41.10]The world trembled.
[05:42.80]Thank you, Chewie Rock.
[05:43.86]How's my hair?
[05:44.30]It's okay.
[05:44.62]It's repairing.
[05:45.18]20 pixel tiny movie stream.
[05:58.95]Just wait till I get to the options menu.
[06:01.65]Alright, who fucking cares, right?
[06:05.39]Alien dungeon, you've attempted to... You've attempted to protect kinsmen in your village against tax collectors just being thrown into prison for threes.
[06:15.72]Rebellious crimes against selenium.
[06:18.40]You awaken from unconsciousness.
[06:20.18]In prison, you must find a way out of the cell, obtain a weapon, defeat the enemies, escape the dungeon.
[06:27.58]That's me.
[06:30.17]Oh my god, this is running at like fucking eight frames a second.
[06:35.72]So, they imprison their own, too, I see.
[06:41.17]The sound you are hearing is the sound of your death.
[06:44.89]Alright.
[06:45.83]The rolling thunder of my fellow outlanders.
[06:48.79]The sound of the dragotar slaughtering your kind.
[06:52.15]Oh, damn.
[06:52.67]Look at that.
[06:53.17]Scaling the walls of those puny porches.
[06:54.77]You see the giant crab?
[06:56.29]They are coming to set me free.
[06:59.05]And if they don't get to you first, I will personally rip you apart with my claws.
[07:17.52]Wait.
[07:19.14]I thought that was gonna be like the last boss.
[07:25.68]I thought that was gonna be the last boss.
[07:27.87]Don't they always show up in the very beginning?
[07:29.31]Oh, dear.
[07:29.95]120.
[07:29.97]800 by 600.
[07:30.27]Good lord.
[07:36.77]1920 by 1080, 32.
[07:37.95]Sync, refresh rate.
[07:39.35]I gotta keep it on.
[07:41.55]Brightness.
[07:42.41]Brighten it up a little.
[07:43.23]No, that's fine.
[07:43.93]Okay.
[07:45.43]Hopefully the fucking stream doesn't crash.
[07:48.19]I'd be very mad about that.
[07:52.48]There we go.
[07:53.82]That's a little bit better.
[07:56.32]Except it's in a fucking letterbox.
[07:57.66]Hold on.
[07:59.86]Let me move this a little bit.
[08:02.68]Just so it's not so terribly letterboxed.
[08:06.97]It's going to be stretched a little bit, but you know, who really cares?
[08:09.87]It's Enclave, right?
[08:12.33]Okay.
[08:17.08]That looks a little better.
[08:17.88]Graphics.
[08:18.98]Decals on.
[08:20.86]Character LED on.
[08:21.88]Yeah, yeah.
[08:22.42]There's not much else I can do.
[08:23.64]Textures.
[08:25.18]Character textures.
[08:26.94]Anastropi.
[08:31.25]Times two, I guess.
[08:32.21]Sound.
[08:34.09]Sound volume.
[08:35.13]Sound volume.
[08:39.23]That's okay, right?
[08:40.19]How's that?
[08:42.41]Is that better?
[08:43.80]3D sound.
[08:45.38]Damn.
[08:47.06]Game.
[08:47.48]Blood on.
[08:48.14]Damage indication on.
[08:48.96]Subtitles on.
[08:49.62]Alright.
[08:51.28]Let's, um... We gotta escape the prison, right?
[08:56.58]Oh, wait.
[08:56.76]What the hell happened?
[08:57.48]Was that just the menu that was like that?
[08:59.37]Wait, what the fuck just happened?
[09:00.27]Hold on.
[09:02.81]I didn't have to... What?
[09:04.59]That's weird.
[09:06.31]Hold on.
[09:06.57]Position size.
[09:06.99]Reset size.
[09:07.41]Reset size.
[09:10.76]Okay, well.
[09:12.36]I guess it isn't leather boxed.
[09:13.88]That was weird.
[09:18.38]My ears.
[09:22.01]Let me just put this back.
[09:25.29]There we go.
[09:26.19]That's that.

[12:44.28]How do I do this?
[12:49.00]Did it tell me how to activate the wheels?
[12:50.76]I don't think it did.

[13:43.21]Can I go to the trapdoor?
[13:47.13]How do I open that?
[13:51.61]This 3D audio is so immersive.
[13:54.27]Oh, wow.
[13:54.83]It opened up like a shop.
[13:59.33]It's not a shop.
[14:01.25]What are they doing?
[14:09.34]Surprise!
[14:12.10]That guy was still celebrating.
[14:13.52]Why can I not kill this one?

[14:30.68]What opens that?
[14:32.88]What here?
[14:34.22]That door cannot be opened.
[14:39.20]And an attractive 5 foot 1 mil.
[14:42.26]That's a bomb!
[14:47.20]Fucking destroyed.
[14:49.84]This is better than Resident Evil 7.
[14:56.59]This actually is like kind of good.
[15:01.01]I say kind of good because it reminds me of like a much older version of Dark Souls.
[15:06.86]Or like Morrowind.
[15:14.14]I'm kind of playing like a dipshit, but that's okay.
[15:20.50]Uh... Where should I go?
[15:22.68]Should I jump into the paintings like Mario?
[15:31.29]I'm gonna jump and it's gonna go... Um...
[15:42.09]Need a key to open this door.
[15:43.31]Where the fuck is the key?
[15:47.32]There it is.
[15:56.25]Key.
[15:57.79]Use mouse 2 to use key, okay.
[16:00.57]Alright.
[16:10.63]Huh?
[16:11.81]You found 20 of 50 gold pieces.
[16:13.73]20 new gold pieces have been added.
[16:17.31]You've been awarded a new mission.
[16:18.69]Name?
[16:19.91]To protect the outpost.
[16:22.37]You have found a new item worth 50 gold.
[16:24.33]Sword.
[16:24.79]Weakest of the sword class weapons.
[16:26.28]It simply performs its duty.
[16:28.78]Congratulations.
[16:29.34]You found wood targa.
[16:30.34]Okay.
[16:30.72]It's going to do that with every item?
[16:39.95]Protect the... You just pick mission... Alright, protect the outpost.
[16:45.09]Defeat the outlanders, defeat Borgia.
[16:58.02]Sword equals weakest sword.
[17:01.26]Oh, I just cut off her dialogue.
[17:05.00]Fuck.
[17:06.85]I swung at her and now I broke her.
[17:09.29]She doesn't work anymore.
[17:10.07]Alright, this is... It's Q to switch weapon.
[17:17.41]Alright, I got the crossbow now.
[17:18.45]Just making sure it works.
[17:30.70]72 damage, are you kidding me?
[17:32.50]This thing is fucking unbelievable.
[17:36.51]Why are you not shooting?
[17:41.59]She's just still shooting at her.
[17:42.87]276.
[17:42.89]Alright, forget everything I said.
[17:45.09]That was good.
[17:54.99]Yeah, I know.
[17:59.81]We're under attack.
[18:00.75]It's okay.
[18:02.13]Hey, thank you.
[18:02.55]I love donuts for the 12 months.
[18:04.17]Welcome back.
[18:05.71]Thank you for your 12 straight months.
[18:07.72]Where did she go?
[18:08.20]Come on.
[18:12.32]What's she doing?
[18:14.94]Get out of that wall.
[18:16.74]Get over here.
[18:17.10]This way.
[18:18.78]Follow me.
[18:20.72]What?
[18:24.63]What just happened?
[18:27.05]That should just break?
[18:30.81]I just got so... Did I shoot the door with a cannon?
[18:35.37]I mean, it's oddly placed, right?
[18:39.22]Yeah, okay.
[18:44.08]That works.
[18:46.46]Alright, let's keep going.
[18:50.22]Thank you, UltraD3000 and Sab3600.
[18:52.94]Welcome back for 10 months and 4 months.
[18:54.30]Thanks a lot, guy.
[18:58.45]What's his bow?
[18:59.01]Is it a pig?
[19:00.95]What is that?
[19:01.91]Oh, it's a bomb.
[19:02.67]It's gonna explode.
[19:03.51]Watch out.
[19:03.83]Don't go near the door.
[19:04.39]That still hurt me somehow.
[19:09.55]Did you shoot him with your 300 damage bow?
[19:11.49]Oh my god.
[19:12.43]I don't even have to do anything.
[19:16.93]Is it?
[19:18.21]Oh shit.
[19:18.61]That's gonna blow.
[19:23.10]Such a long fuse.
[19:31.74]Where did my friend go?
[19:32.68]I don't want to get fucking killed here.
[19:40.13]She's got a collateral.
[19:45.65]Gotta pick up those lucky charms.
[19:48.86]Am I a clown again?
[19:50.28]No.
[19:50.96]No, I'm not a clown again.
[19:53.38]Not today.
[20:01.06]Right door?
[20:01.42]Let's go right door.
[20:04.66]You're in the fucking bushes.
[20:10.18]I gotta kill the first boss before I quit this game.
[20:14.98]Is that the first boss?
[20:15.70]No.
[20:18.53]The bomb is so powerful, it reduces your resolution for a second.
[20:26.71]Yeah.
[20:28.23]Kinda.
[20:32.24]Was I supposed to do that?
[20:36.62]Ow, fuck!
[20:37.38]That hurt.
[20:39.14]Can I climb?
[20:44.68]Maybe the other door?
[20:49.37]I mean, there was another door to go into.
[20:56.67]You really can't see anything?
[20:57.75]It's too dark?
[21:05.36]We have to get through the first, like, the first two missions, right?
[21:09.94]That's super important.
[21:14.14]Alright, this is going to be hard.
[21:15.56]This is a hard room.
[21:25.42]Is that cleave on this thing or no?
[21:26.95]Yeah, I had to pick the light story.
[21:31.31]I couldn't pick the other one.
[21:32.13]How much does this heal?
[21:34.03]Just enough.
[21:38.10]Next.
[21:38.56]Look, this is just an off-scheduled chill stream.
[21:47.96]Bye Didn't I have a companion?
[21:55.37]Wasn't there a person that was shooting arrows with me?
[21:57.77]Did she die?
[22:06.97]Play the movies?
[22:07.65]You know, I might make like one movie before we go tonight
[22:19.60]I'll just go into sandbox mode and just make a fucking stupid move.
[22:32.55]Goblin gold.
[22:33.72]That's right.
[22:34.82]Goblin's gold.
[22:42.42]I wonder how much more of this you guys can take.
[22:43.90]What do you think?
[22:45.80]How much more of this can you take?
[22:48.32]This game was $4.99.
[22:48.90]And I was like, you know what?
[22:50.76]Yeah, I'll play that on stream.
[22:52.40]Why not?
[22:52.88]I'm just hanging out.
[22:53.63]It's like Saturday.
[22:55.35]Off schedule.
[22:56.03]Why not?
[22:56.49]Alright, here we go.
[23:02.03]First boss.
[23:14.16]There he is.
[23:15.40]You can tell because he has the fucking Spider-Man shield.
[23:19.38]I think you Flux Resistor for the sub.
[23:20.78]Welcome, dude.
[23:27.21]Now what?
[23:33.21]I was really hoping he was going to die.
[23:35.53]That would have been great.
[23:38.71]Rusty Key.
[23:43.29]I guess I just have to go this way.
[23:44.54]I don't know.
[23:53.10]I have no idea.
[23:53.96]Did I miss a door?
[23:58.75]I'm not sure there's any way I can even go.
[24:00.13]I think I have to go that way.
[24:03.15]We can go this way.
[24:03.93]Did I miss a door?
[24:06.11]Was there, like, another door?
[24:09.39]Oh, shit.
[24:10.17]Watch out.
[24:10.47]We'll snipe this guy.
[24:12.54]Got him.
[24:15.77]Fuck.
[24:19.29]I co-opted him by myself.
[24:20.87]Hey, thank you, TJ.
[24:22.95]Thanks for the sub.
[24:25.25]I'm gonna fucking die.
[24:29.41]Next.
[24:34.15]Well, we... Next is the movies.
[24:36.20]So, we have to... Look, I paid $5 for this.
[24:40.16]Let me get my $5 of entertainment from it.
[24:50.27]Let me have this.
[24:50.81]Let me have this like fucking 10 minutes.
[24:58.69]Then ultra next.
[25:03.81]How do I open this door?
[25:07.23]He opened it for me.
[25:08.56]He kicked it.
[25:14.02]Now it's getting interesting.
[25:15.38]See?
[25:18.05]Now it's getting interesting.
[25:28.49]Shit, come on.
[25:33.47]Well, neat game.
[25:39.69]Like, remember when the lady got killed in the very beginning?
[25:45.97]You know how funny that was?
[25:48.46]Don't you know, there might be like another one of those moments.
[25:54.33]That could happen.
[25:58.77]Don't put it past this game.
[25:59.86]It might happen again.
[26:00.62]Oh my god.
[26:06.98]That didn't hit him?
[26:12.81]I'm gonna die.
[26:13.37]I'm gonna die in this game.
[26:16.43]I only have two potions left and I'm fighting like... I'm fighting like Bebop.
[26:21.98]Bebop and Rocksteady are like fighting me right now.
[26:27.00]You don't think that was worth like at least a dollar?
[26:33.88]I'll just make this guy follow me around.
[26:35.91]Should have been a headshot.
[26:39.51]Put in the cheat codes?
[26:42.34]I could put cheat codes in.
[26:43.62]What can we do?
[26:44.22]Somebody look up cheat codes for this game.
[26:46.15]Do it right now.
[26:47.45]Like, what do I do to get fucking noclip?
[26:50.91]I'll do it right now, I swear to God.
[26:52.45]If there's a dev console for this game, I'll do it right now.
[27:00.36]I have a new character.
[27:01.18]Okay.
[27:05.48]Like, somebody find me the mode where... Oh, hold on.
[27:08.79]You have done us a great service.
[27:11.47]Helping in staving off these vile invaders despite your imprisonment is bold, to say the least.
[27:16.61]Isn't this the same one that we had arrested earlier?
[27:19.49]You expect us to believe that these people are loyal to us when they won't even pay the taxes that they owe?
[27:25.54]I'm gonna recreate this in the movies.
[27:27.20]I'm gonna remake this whole game.
[27:38.43]It is true that you have committed a crime against us.
[27:42.11]Yet it seems you are willing to prove your loyalty to Selenheim.
[27:46.40]Because of this, I will offer you a proposition.
[27:49.66]If you continue to serve our cause, you will receive full pardons and be embraced as honored warriors henceforth.
[27:59.58]There is a merchant named Marcus in the town of Saladia.
[28:03.16]How fast can we beat this game, do you think?
[28:05.16]If I enable god mode and no clip, do you think I can just fucking get to the very end of the game?
[28:09.10]It's probably possible.
[28:09.82]Hold on.
[28:10.30]I need to see who this is.
[28:30.35]Steam community.
[28:31.09]How to enable the console and cheats.

[35:54.76]How many arrows did I shoot at him?
[36:04.67]Alright, where do I go?
[36:05.39]I need to find the mission start.
[36:10.46]Isn't it him right there?
[36:14.68]Maybe I can't be in noclip to start the mission.
[36:16.40]Alright, I'm going to turn noclip off and we'll start the mission.
[36:20.64]How sad.
[36:21.34]Alright, noclip.

[37:51.53]Oh god, wait.
[37:53.01]This is harder to do in Oakley.
[37:55.89]This is harder to do in Oakley.
[37:58.79]I would've probably got the key by now.
[38:07.11]pick anything up.
[38:09.07]What's that?
[38:09.61]What is this magical device?
[38:11.75]Alright, hold on.

[39:11.52]There's the bad guy!
[39:13.90]Get him!
[39:16.24]Wait, what?
[39:22.07]I think the game broke.
[39:23.49]I think the game broke.
[39:31.16]Wait, hold on.
[39:47.97]It's over.
[39:52.75]Command orc music.
[39:53.87]Is there no other commands?
[39:57.82]Just end mission to where on the final boss.
[39:59.72]Good fucking idea.
[40:01.06]That is a great idea.
[40:03.80]That person knows what they're fucking talking about.
[40:05.76]I told you we would beat an enclave today.
[40:08.61]I told you it was going to happen.
[40:10.53]We're going to end mission until we beat the game.
[40:13.01]We're going to get to the last boss.
[40:14.89]And I'm going to fight him.
[40:23.84]Somebody give me the fucking... No, not the new game.
[40:26.43]Fuck off.
[40:29.99]Alright, we're gonna do continue.
[40:35.37]Are there any other?
[40:37.85]Just give all?
[40:39.16]Give all items.
[40:43.88]Alright, we're gonna do knight.
[40:44.74]We're gonna command give all.
[40:50.04]Truly a $5 experience.
[40:51.42]Yeah, I would say so.
[40:54.55]Alright.
[41:01.04]What is it?
[41:01.42]CG underscore cheat.
[41:05.14]What was it?
[41:05.54]CG underscore menu?
[41:06.46]Cheat menu?
[41:10.16]Command give all.
[41:12.70]I don't think that did anything.
[41:20.88]Command give all.
[41:27.01]I don't think I have all.
[41:29.01]Command set gold.
[41:32.51]Set gold.
[41:33.29]1,000?
[41:37.83]I don't know.
[41:42.09]Command next game.
[41:50.00]It's CG menu cheat menu, right?
[41:53.00]What was it?
[41:55.18]I don't remember.
[41:59.06]I wish the text wasn't so fucking tiny.
[42:02.60]We're gonna just beat every single level.
[42:07.03]CG menu cheat menu.
[42:08.85]Oh my god, CG underscore menu cheat menu.
[42:18.84]Okay, complete mission.
[42:21.88]Nice work.
[42:31.89]Doesn't even matter.
[42:32.53]None of this fucking matters.
[42:39.98]Is there a faster way to do this?
[43:03.60]Hopefully this is not fucking really long.
[43:05.76]I wonder what happens if I get like here and do it.
[43:17.77]Speed run.
[43:18.17]Yeah, actually I can just press up.
[43:28.91]I got a new character.
[43:33.98]I feel like this is gonna be a long fucking time.
[43:37.14]What happens if I do it now?
[43:41.22]Why is it defaulting to no-click?
[43:46.44]Shit, I might have just broke it.
[43:55.07]Oh, wait a minute!
[43:55.57]Wait, we're in a new level!
[43:56.73]We gotta at least look around for a second.
[43:58.91]New area.
[44:00.40]This is, like, scary.
[44:02.55]Oh, there's, like, Little Rock golems.
[44:06.17]No, we gotta, we gotta, hold on.
[44:07.25]Hold on.
[44:12.13]We need to look around.
[44:17.09]I need to see, like, what else is here.
[44:18.39]This is, like, kind of cool looking.
[44:19.37]We need an oak cliff, right?
[44:20.11]Alright, this is a boss door.
[44:24.60]Yep, this is, like, you go up here.
[44:25.72]Around this corner.
[44:27.56]There's gonna be, like, a boss up here in this room somewhere.
[44:36.48]Okay, cool.
[44:36.92]Nice.
[44:40.90]What the fuck?
[44:42.61]Get out of there.
[44:44.55]What a legit playthrough.
[44:45.61]Oh, that's... It crashed again.
[44:55.43]That's it.
[44:55.97]I'm outta here.
[44:58.29]Get me the fuck outta here.
[44:59.73]I just wanted to beat every single level and then fucking fight the final boss.
[45:06.79]This is gonna take all day.
[45:07.75]Yeah, we're just gonna go play the movies.
[45:09.15]Fuck this.
[45:10.69]Fuck this.
[45:13.59]Fuck this fucking $5 game.
[45:18.09]We're done.
[45:18.70]I'm opening up the movies.
[45:19.62]We're gonna make a movie.
[45:23.20]It was a nice idea, right?
[45:25.06]It was an interesting idea.
[45:28.32]But let's go make a movie.
[45:31.20]Let's go.
[45:31.48]I'm gonna go recreate that in the movies, right?
