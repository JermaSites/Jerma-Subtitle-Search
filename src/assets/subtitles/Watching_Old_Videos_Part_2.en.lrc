[00:00.98]Alright, let me change this to IRL.
[00:05.60]Just chatting.
[00:15.15]Just chatting.
[00:21.83]Well, they were going to fix it tomorrow, apparently, so let's really hope that they do.
[00:27.52]Rage 2 stream?
[00:28.60]I don't need any more Rage.
[00:30.91]I'm at like Rage 10.
[00:33.83]I'm not at a Rage 2 out of 10.
[00:35.35]I'm at like an 8 out of 10 for Rage.
[00:40.30]Use Transformer to complain about cocks.
[00:42.20]Alright, we might as well.
[00:44.20]We just need like audio for that anyways.
[00:52.85]I told you not to do Cox.
[00:54.23]This is the only company.
[00:55.13]There's two companies here.
[00:56.44]It's Cox and CenturyLink, and they're both dog shit.
[01:00.46]There's no... You can't win.
[01:01.87]Don't you dare.
[01:02.41]You cannot win with North American Internet.
[01:04.45]You have to roll dice.
[01:25.39]Just start your own company.
[01:31.52]I have CenturyLink.
[01:32.42]It's dog shit.
[01:35.32]Like Google Fiber.
[01:36.86]Why do you think everyone's moving to one fucking city in this country that's a streamer?
[01:42.04]Because it's the only place with real, reliable fiber.
[01:44.95]And they're not even doing that anymore.
[01:46.87]Didn't they can that?
[01:49.69]Remove shortcuts.
[01:57.66]Jerma's next up to be Sybil's boyfriend?
[02:00.88]I don't know about that.
[02:05.41]Oh, Jexnet!
[02:10.33]Oh, it's because I'm right here.
[02:11.47]I see what you mean.
[02:19.66]I'm willing to let this try to work itself out.
[02:23.80]Before I completely, you know, throw in the towel here.
[02:30.30]Jack snap.
[02:32.48]I need to move this camera.
[02:44.45]Move this.
[02:48.53]Hey, let's just stretch me out.
[02:49.77]I'll just look bigger.
[02:53.39]Oh, that doesn't work.
[03:07.61]Alright, so what do you guys want to talk about?
[03:12.33]Ask me anything.
[03:13.43]Ask me literally anything.
[03:23.74]What is that shaped hair?
[03:26.60]It's called ice cream melting over the side of the cone.
[03:33.60]Ask for that next time you go there.
[03:37.64]You got a job as a substitute- Any tips for a substitute teacher job?
[03:42.75]Um... Yeah.
[03:46.73]It's- I would pass that down to any generation that wanted it.
[03:50.89]What?
[03:52.65]Any generation?
[03:56.29]Would you consider yourself a 90s kid?
[03:59.42]I mean, I was born in 85.
[04:00.38]I gotta change the title here to, like, Frames are Depleting.
[04:06.97]Oh, is it already there?
[04:08.99]I think we're there, right?
[04:14.12]Would you watch this clip earlier in the stream?
[04:17.90]What?
[04:18.18]What did I do earlier in the stream?
[04:23.30]God, you're so old.
[04:24.18]Yeah, I don't claim to be young.
[04:25.89]I don't claim to be like a young man anymore.
[04:30.11]Strange frames depleted streamer defeated.
[04:33.33]I like that.
[04:33.79]That's a good one.

[05:50.51]Star Wars.
[05:51.81]Are we going by best to worst?
[05:57.93]Why did I rank episode two as the best Star Wars?
[06:00.20]I thought which way were we going?
[06:05.10]When am I going to do the sequel to Otto's Big Adventure 2?
[06:10.30]Never.
[06:11.70]Never.
[06:12.04]Unless it's a joke.
[06:15.01]For like 10 seconds.
[06:17.79]He's calling football plays.
[06:25.57]What would you sacrifice for a perfect internet?
[06:28.29]The top of this pinky here.
[06:30.97]Like, see this top of this knuckle?
[06:33.92]Just take it off.
[06:37.46]I don't I don't need that do I I don't need that from like here down I was born wait break out the red blend no I'm not drinking I'm not why would I'm not gonna start drinking right now

[07:05.29]What do you mean that's not a sacrifice?
[07:06.29]You said, what would it take?
[07:08.05]And I said, like, the top half of my pinky.
[07:12.00]Well, I don't know.
[07:12.60]Maybe, like, that's a sacrifice.
[07:15.14]Because it would be hard for me to grab stuff.
[07:21.46]Break out the whiskey.
[07:22.38]No.
[07:22.82]No whiskey.
[07:23.56]No booze.
[07:24.84]No.
[07:25.20]I'm not like that upset about this.
[07:26.88]I'm just, like, mildly irritated.
[07:31.11]I'm pretty upset by this.
[07:33.01]I'm actually very upset by this.
[07:34.63]Don't let him fool you.
[07:36.42]Don't let me pretend.
[07:37.24]I'm like very upset by this.
[07:49.00]Play Mario Yahtzee?
[07:52.71]We might.
[07:53.55]Eh, maybe.
[07:54.65]Maybe.
[08:00.00]Why is your facecam so noisy?
[08:01.58]I think... Yeah, that's right.
[08:07.39]Why is this so shitty looking?
[08:15.35]Well, it's because... It's because of this.
[08:23.74]It's like in a weird resolution.
[08:32.65]Yeah, look at this.
[08:33.45]What resolution even is this?
[08:43.27]It's great because I'm sitting down and... So here.
[08:47.37]There you go.
[08:50.49]How mad am I on a... Okay, I'm relaxed to Hotline Miami 2.
[08:56.31]Ah!
[09:04.47]Maybe like the first four pages of Green Eggs and Ham.
[09:09.85]You know what I mean?
[09:12.22]That's where I'd say I am on a scale of upset.
[09:20.14]Clean the closet.
[09:22.57]I will.
[09:23.07]Tomorrow.
[09:27.72]Have I seen any celebrities in Las Vegas?
[09:31.58]No, I mean, again, no.
[09:33.58]Again, it's not a... I've seen Criss Angel go like this.
[09:41.39]It's huge.
[09:42.31]It's like on every building.
[09:53.58]How mad are you on the Richter scale?
[09:56.94]Like a mild.
[10:00.80]He still exists?
[10:01.60]Yeah, apparently he does.
[10:07.18]What's this?
[10:10.95]Let's watch some old videos?
[10:13.31]Yeah, let's watch some old.
[10:14.37]Let's just chill.
[10:15.03]I'm defeated.
[10:21.06]I'm defeated.
[10:24.75]30,000 drop frames.
[10:25.91]That's too many.
[10:29.92]We've been live for an hour.
[10:31.02]Alright, let me set this up to get this to work.
[10:35.80]Let's, um... I had a friend who believed everything Criss Angel did was actually magic.
[10:53.22]I mean what is magic though magic is it's just fooling and you know subversion right alright uh let me put this over here what do you guys want to watch what like you want to watch a video of mine you want to watch like the old should we like vote on these
[11:28.72]I don't know how we would vote on him.
[11:33.02]Put on... Rat Movie!
[11:39.18]Otto's Big Adventure.
[11:40.94]Watch yesterday's stream.
[11:52.72]I'm not gonna watch yesterday's stream.
[11:55.62]That was a lot of fun, but...
[11:59.90]Watch Death to Spies.
[12:05.81]Oh yeah, I forgot about this.
[12:10.91]This video has a million views.
[12:12.25]Holy shit.
[12:20.10]Watch your least liked video.
[12:21.94]I don't know.
[12:22.26]I don't want to do that.
[12:27.70]Your least liked video.
[12:32.83]Let's see.
[12:36.41]I don't even know.
[12:36.91]Can I even sort on a channel for that?
[12:48.06]I'm gonna make this a little bigger.
[12:55.00]No, no, no.
[12:55.50]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[12:57.20]Stop it.
[12:59.97]Stop it.
[13:03.31]Okay, I stopped it.
[13:10.07]So now let's put this on here.
[13:11.97]I should be able to turn it on.
[13:16.78]Hey, this video has the same amount of likes that I have dropped frames today.
[13:31.18]Let's full screen this.
[13:37.63]Death to Spies!
[13:38.55]This is an old one.
[13:44.77]Can I... Okay.
[13:54.14]I gotta give myself a spot here, right?
[13:57.34]This is the video that got you into the channel.
[13:59.50]Really?
[14:02.48]This is some of the funniest fucking shit I think I ever saw in a video game.
[14:07.01]Can I not, like, just make this be the whole screen?
[14:15.00]Why are you doing this?
[14:15.58]Come on.
[14:20.68]Come on, what are you doing?
[14:22.40]This is killing me.
[14:25.61]Alright, let's watch Death to Spies.
[14:27.63]It's been a while since I've seen this.
[14:31.61]In fact, I think it's been years since I've opened this video.
[14:40.44]Let's watch it.
[14:45.98]Okay.
[14:48.62]Here we go.
[14:50.48]Is that as loud as I can get it?
[14:56.82]I feel like it needs to be louder.
[15:03.91]Can I not make that louder?
[15:06.99]Guys, I don't do this.
[15:07.73]I never do videos on stream.
[15:14.49]Is that getting louder for you guys?
[15:15.85]I think it is.
[15:16.29]Yeah, it is.
[15:17.61]Alright, there we go.
[15:21.98]That's better.
[15:29.88]Where am I supposed to bring this guy?
[15:32.62]This is a gigantic base with people in it.
[15:34.30]How am I supposed to sneak him out?
[15:35.86]Leave the base captive.
[15:38.74]Oh, the body can be hidden in a truck.
[15:41.06]And that makes sense.
[15:42.96]Okay, well, you stay put.
[15:44.29]I'll be back.
[15:46.45]I killed him.
[15:49.91]I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes trying to figure out what exactly this fucking guy is doing.
[15:56.19]Yeah, what the fuck?
[15:56.99]He's like cleaning his hand.
[15:58.35]Is he wiping down this old rusty cabinet with his hands?
[16:02.98]Or is he looking for a stud?
[16:05.78]That's a good one.
[16:06.28]What are you doing?
[16:07.24]That's a good one.
[16:08.36]Stop it, please.
[16:11.06]I had to do that.
[16:11.70]You had...
[16:19.89]Pause it!
[16:21.31]Pause it, I'll give you some inside information here.
[16:24.37]So, there was a spot here that I tried to go into, like, probably 30 to 40 times.
[16:32.06]It took a long time to get in this exact area where I couldn't get shot.
[16:36.76]And this is where I figured out that people were just stumping into the room.
[16:41.22]And I died so many times here trying to fit myself in this one spot to go underneath.
[16:48.80]Because your head is underneath and they can't hit you.
[16:52.10]It was like a pixel that you could step on.
[16:56.74]Oh, he found me.
[16:57.20]He found me.
[16:59.50]He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.
[17:04.07]Oh, shit.
[17:05.31]Did you guys see that?
[17:06.27]That fucking hat over there.
[17:08.39]I can't seem to hit it.
[17:09.91]How do I hit this fucking hat that's on the ground?
[17:12.21]Oh.
[17:16.40]You guys are so stupid.
[17:17.94]You can't hit a fucking- Alright, so here's another thing, right?
[17:23.58]I was trying to like set this up because I thought this was funny.
[17:27.64]And the grenade coming into the room is something that I never prepared for.
[17:31.52]There was no way I could have ever prepared for that.
[17:36.88]It was like no fucking way.
[17:41.13]I have to do this a bunch more times.
[17:44.39]So I was trying to get them to miss me while I was the hat on the ground and it turned into this.
[17:48.77]So.
[17:49.53]Hat on the ground.
[17:50.81]Is that what you're saying?
[17:58.64]How does he... The explosion.
[18:03.48]Who is flying by and dropping missiles on this place?
[18:10.23]Stop with the fucking bombs.
[18:14.72]I'm being hit by this guy.
[18:18.06]Are you kidding me?
[18:19.65]Are you guys kidding me right now?
[18:24.19]These people are all out of their minds.
[18:26.57]They keep coming in here, realizing where I am, and then somebody throws a grenade into the room and they have to leave.
[18:34.85]And some of them actually die.
[18:38.45]This shit was so fucking funny.
[18:39.97]There he is.
[18:40.81]I found him.
[18:41.85]Oh, wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?
[18:45.09]They all run out.
[18:46.47]They all like scatter out.
[18:47.83]Which one of you morons is going to throw the grenade?
[18:51.77]That's the question.
[18:53.90]We got the whole troop in here.
[18:57.76]Who is going to be the trigger finger moron?
[19:00.80]That does it.
[19:02.52]Oh, get him.
[19:03.90]What's the hold up?
[19:09.10]I don't understand what the holdup is.
[19:14.82]Was it you?
[19:16.32]Was it you?
[19:16.98]Then somebody comes in and fucking throws it at her.
[19:29.67]What's going on?
[19:30.31]Ugh.
[19:39.11]Look at this guy.
[19:43.87]This dude, this guy aiming the gun that way.
[19:46.05]Throw it.
[19:49.04]Throw the grenade.
[19:50.14]Here we go.
[19:50.60]This is my favorite one.
[19:53.30]Somebody comes in and throws it after I throw one, I think, right?
[19:55.64]Throw it.
[19:58.62]Alright, get up.
[19:59.18]Yeah, see this guy.
[20:00.30]Throw one in here.
[20:03.82]He's sitting there standing, looking.
[20:05.74]Why would you walk in the room after you threw it?
[20:08.28]You threw it into the wall.
[20:09.80]He throws it in, and then he walks in the room.
[20:13.36]I've just been reloading this over and over again.
[20:15.60]It's true.
[20:16.29]I was.
[20:19.41]That guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way.
[20:24.20]forgot about that one something interesting if you take a look at the guy hold on the guy that just stands there and just goes this is the best game ever man like this is seriously one of the funniest oh they don't make them like this anymore that guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way oh yeah this next part too I I don't I don't I could like stream this game I probably could
[20:55.60]But the next part, we're the chef.
[20:59.04]And that's like a super disguise, apparently.
[21:01.84]I don't know when.
[21:02.26]Nobody can see through it, right?
[21:03.38]Oh, no, no.
[21:03.70]Only one guy could see through disguises.
[21:05.96]It was the chef.
[21:06.46]That's it.
[21:07.86]Something interesting.
[21:08.72]It was un-fucking-real.
[21:09.48]Take a look at the mini-map.
[21:10.36]You see all the green blobs?
[21:12.20]Those are all the people, all the guards, all the hotel staff.
[21:16.08]All the people here cannot see through my disguise.
[21:19.08]There's one red blip.
[21:20.90]Do you want to know who it is?
[21:23.88]The chef.
[21:26.55]There are other chefs in here.
[21:28.33]They can't see through.
[21:29.09]I'm just gonna... Right, so... Explain to me why other chefs couldn't see through my disguise.
[21:39.08]One chef.
[21:41.14]Everybody else... I don't get it.
[21:44.80]Throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.
[21:46.46]Don't just hurt me.
[21:55.99]This guy grabbed my leg.
[21:57.71]What is going on?
[21:58.33]What is hurting me?
[22:01.15]What the fuck is... What?
[22:02.75]He killed me.
[22:05.55]Did I freeze in the freezer?
[22:08.05]Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer.
[22:10.45]Do not give me that kind of power.
[22:14.17]Hey, Gary.
[22:14.87]Just the man I wanted to see.
[22:16.01]Hey, look.
[22:16.61]Can you go ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the free... What a fucking idiot.
[22:20.57]What an idiot.
[22:23.86]I know.
[22:24.10]Do me a favor, Gary.
[22:25.92]Fucking freeze.
[22:29.78]He's not freezing.
[22:31.94]Bullshit.
[22:32.30]Is this guy immune to cold?
[22:34.68]This was horseshit.
[22:35.56]I was so mad about this.
[22:36.66]Why do I freeze in here, but he doesn't?
[22:39.11]That's bullshit.
[22:41.23]Gary.
[22:44.28]I was hoping that it actually froze.
[22:48.45]The internet froze it.
[22:51.15]What I was actually hoping was going to happen there was that I could fill that freezer with people.
[22:58.21]Just keep throwing coins or whatever, throwing stuff in there.
[23:01.56]And they would just keep going in there and I'd close the door and they would just be in there.
[23:07.16]Would it feel weird recording a game for a video without a live audience anymore?
[23:11.08]Yeah, probably.
[23:13.85]Because honestly, people say, oh, you don't, you know, I don't make videos anymore.
[23:18.19]But this is the, I did this same shit off stream.
[23:23.36]When I'd stream a game now, I just, I treat it the same way as if I was going to make a video on it, essentially.
[23:29.40]So it's, it's different, but it's also kind of the same.
[23:35.19]Now there's live feedback for everything.
[23:38.23]And I don't edit things out, I don't put things, like, in, like, graphic layovers or, um, sound or music or something, right?
[23:46.75]So it's, uh, it's different, but it's also pretty, it's very much the same, too.
[23:53.82]Do I play games off-stream?
[23:55.58]Sometimes.
[23:56.14]Not that much anymore, though.
[24:00.46]But, here we go.
[24:02.78]Put the guy in the chair.
[24:06.04]He won't even suspect a goddamn thing.
[24:10.53]Oh, yeah, that's the guy that I was supposed to save.
[24:12.29]I was supposed to kill that guy.
[24:13.69]I was supposed to, like, go bug that guy or something, right?
[24:17.49]God damn it.
[24:21.69]That's easy.
[24:23.25]I'm not even making sounds.
[24:24.31]Okay, I'm not doing anything in here.
[24:27.51]Are you seriously wondering how that guy died?
[24:30.41]You opened the door and I did it.
[24:31.77]Don't fuck with Jeff!
[24:37.42]This part.
[24:37.72]This game is out of control.
[25:03.03]You're right, Jerry.
[25:04.27]And I agree.
[25:05.73]I think this piano player really needs to shut the fuck up.
[25:08.85]Get some rock music in here.
[25:10.44]You know what I'm saying?
[25:14.00]That funny, like... Was I spawning spoons?
[25:21.00]Where did I get these from?
[25:21.92]No, I was just taking them off the tables, right.
[25:23.38]I'm just being annoying right now.
[25:24.80]That's all I'm doing.
[25:27.24]Just ruining these people's dinner.
[25:33.62]Oh, I forgot people just came in and pissed on you.
[25:37.13]Excuse me.
[25:39.07]Are you serious?
[25:39.91]Occupied.
[25:40.43]Get out of here.
[25:41.83]What are you doing?
[25:42.81]Get away from me.
[25:48.09]Oh, good afternoon.
[25:49.67]Yeah, there's somebody in this one.
[25:52.50]Yeah, no, somebody's still in it.
[25:53.82]Thank you for understanding.
[25:55.46]Second time.
[25:57.26]Third time.
[25:58.88]He's going to piss in my face.
[26:04.36]He just comes in.
[26:06.72]They don't care.
[26:07.30]The AI doesn't even know you're in there.
[26:09.08]They just fucking pee.
[26:14.94]Grab that auto.
[26:17.00]I almost died making grab that auto.
[26:18.98]That last part.
[26:24.81]It's been, I haven't seen these in a long time.
[26:26.53]It's been a very long time.
[26:29.55]Grab that auto.
[26:30.05]Alright, we'll do grab that auto.
[26:34.98]Oh, subscribe for more!
[26:37.64]Four years ago, we decided to tell you to do that, you know?
[26:44.20]Role-playing duck gamers.
[26:45.92]Oh, I forgot about that one, too.
[26:49.03]I forgot about all these videos.
[26:50.75]Alright, give me one second.
[26:53.91]I want to go grab some water.
[26:56.67]I'll be right back.
[27:02.26]Also, again, thanks everybody for your patience and shit.
[27:05.08]I'm sorry that we had to kind of dip out and do something else for a little while.
[27:11.58]But I really appreciate it.
[27:14.78]Let's move on.
[27:15.80]I'll be right back.
[31:13.74]Oh, fuck, it's getting worse, isn't it?
[31:18.98]Holy shit, it's getting worse.
[31:29.05]I left at 40,000 drop frames, and now there's 47,000 drop frames.
[31:34.79]Shit.
[31:39.03]We keep hitting this critical mass right now.
[31:50.14]Alright, let's, uh... Let's put on Grab That Auto 5.
[32:02.37]Grab That Auto 5.
[32:04.93]You know what's one thing that's interesting?
[32:07.13]Is the... Is the view counts on some of these videos.
[32:12.05]Like, I... Grab That Auto 5 has 4.5 million views.
[32:18.02]That's fucking crazy.
[32:19.60]That's... How?
[32:21.80]That's a lot.
[32:27.10]It's interesting to go back and kind of see just how these videos have grown, in a way.
[32:40.97]Fuck.
[32:46.50]Oof.
[32:52.03]Guys, guys, this is not looking good.
[32:54.31]This is bad.
[32:55.51]This is like, I don't even, this is not good.
[33:03.90]This is not good.
[33:04.70]Fuck.
[33:11.04]People watch them more than once.
[33:12.16]Yeah, no, that's awesome.
[33:13.68]Like, I'm glad that people have been able to watch these videos more than once and still like them and still watch them.
[33:20.31]That's fucking cool.
[33:21.43]I'm glad you like it that much.
[33:25.89]I had some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life was making some of these videos.
[33:30.59]Most of them, actually.
[33:31.70]So, it's... Don't give up.
[33:38.52]Don't give up.
[33:40.44]Um...
[33:44.31]It may be time to give up.
[33:53.35]It may be time to give up.
[34:03.22]Well, I'm going to stick it out for a little longer.
[34:05.98]It's getting worse as we go along here.
[34:09.95]get grab that auto on the screen um so if I might I might get cut off completely here so let me just tell you the plan uh if this does happen so the plan they're supposed to be like really looking into this and fixing this tomorrow so I'm gonna take tomorrow off let them just do what they need to do I'm gonna stay on top of it and we're gonna get it fitch settled right
[34:38.26]So, but because this stream is going to be really all over the place and like barely a stream, uh, after Monday, I'm going to try to come back on Tuesday and we'll just go Tuesday, Wednesday, right?
[34:48.99]Like I'll just take this one day while they try to fix it.
[34:53.14]So that plan is to come back on Tuesday, Wednesday, and probably Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I would assume.
[35:02.41]But I was told explicitly that they were really going to get to work on it.
[35:07.25]And I think they know what the problem is.
[35:09.92]But let's use the finite amount of time that we still have and watch another video.
[35:17.50]So let's put this on the screen.
[35:25.83]Hello, I'm John.
[35:27.35]Hello.
[35:29.69]Hello, John.
[35:33.17]I actually need to go like this.
[35:35.29]I got like an ad.
[35:39.51]Hold on.
[35:47.40]Let me let the ad play out first.
[35:48.92]This is a nine minute video.
[35:52.60]I didn't even realize that.
[35:53.35]Okay.
[35:58.51]This should be it.
[36:02.90]Hey, look at that.
[36:05.44]Is that in the right spot?
[36:06.40]I think it is.
[36:07.16]Alright.
[36:12.49]Hi.
[36:13.55]Grab that auto five.
[36:15.42]Chin cam incoming.
[36:18.92]It's also been a very long time since I've seen this one too.
[36:30.22]Let's go ahead and type in Grand Theft Auto into the App Store search bar.
[36:34.37]Go do this if you have never done it before.
[36:36.73]GTA.
[36:37.39]Type GTA.
[36:39.27]San Andreas.
[36:39.75]You got Vice City.
[36:41.91]And you got all this.
[36:45.49]What is all this?
[36:47.67]Grab the Auto 5.
[36:49.41]Type in GTA into the App Store.
[36:50.69]Please accidentally download me.
[36:52.53]Grand Auto.
[36:56.14]Thumbstick is right on an ad.
[36:58.55]So we're off to a great start here.
[37:02.23]Do I have a mission to do?
[37:05.55]Or is this just pop in the game?
[37:08.83]This engine, whatever it is, can't even load 15 feet in front of me.
[37:13.77]I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.
[37:25.69]Doesn't Apple have to approve apps?
[37:29.62]Let's get out and walk.
[37:33.40]Does this actually have a radio like GTA as well?
[37:39.30]I want that bike.
[37:41.50]Give me that bike.
[37:45.14]Yes, thank you.
[37:45.68]Thank you for getting off of your bike and dying.
[37:48.77]No, he doesn't.
[37:49.69]He kicks my ass, doesn't he?
[37:51.13]Oh, my God.
[37:51.91]I have to unlock.
[37:52.93]Everything has to be unlocked.
[37:54.19]Money and diamonds and shit.
[37:57.88]Let's get back in my burger car, one of the only cars I can fucking drive.
[38:01.70]Hold on.
[38:07.10]15 diamonds.
[38:07.60]There it is, the best one!
[38:08.88]They take a very long time to load.
[38:12.73]This one has graphics.
[38:15.25]This music is so annoying.
[38:18.45]I've memorized this whole song.
[38:19.55]Is anyone driving this car?
[38:22.07]No, there's not.
[38:22.87]Nobody's driving the car.
[38:26.05]How do I shut this music off?
[38:33.30]Fucking music.
[38:34.28]I can't get over this music.
[38:44.88]Shooting it?
[38:45.58]Oh, this is like the Fred Flintstone one.
[38:47.28]Watch out for the cop car.
[38:52.90]I've probably got so many viruses.
[38:54.77]I've probably got put on so many lists.
[39:03.07]Why is it just singing to me?
[39:09.25]Is that a police car?
[39:10.81]Or is that a bird?
[39:12.21]Like a chickadee.
[39:17.03]Cops found you.
[39:17.73]Get rid of them.
[39:20.99]Sounds like Kirby.
[39:24.23]Holy shit!
[39:26.99]What am I supposed to do?
[39:27.57]How do you beat that?
[39:31.43]See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that... I'm riding a star!
[39:34.88]That's right.
[39:35.24]...don't care at all.
[39:37.52]This is pretty normal to them, apparently.
[39:44.18]Just a normal day in shitsville.
[39:46.90]Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of fucking bricks.
[39:52.13]Oh my god.
[39:54.20]Why can't you make a full game like this?
[39:58.98]What's in those guns?
[40:02.08]You can't be in that car.
[40:05.76]Those were Chad's.
[40:10.44]No way.
[40:10.78]Next car game.
[40:14.32]We know this guy really likes this song.
[40:16.32]That's good to know.
[40:17.60]At least he's got a favorite song.
[40:21.35]This one's real barebone.
[40:23.77]One.
[40:24.65]There was no loading screen, there was no menu, it's just one.
[40:27.29]Okay, um... I wish I could explain how hard this was to move.
[40:35.00]The mapping in the corner was so bad.
[40:36.70]Oh!
[40:37.92]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[40:43.90]That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.
[40:46.87]Go get it.
[40:47.23]20 bucks.
[40:51.52]That was a stack.
[40:52.30]Where are you going?
[40:54.14]Pretend to play it?
[40:54.86]I'm a psycho.
[40:57.85]I can follow that guy.
[41:00.45]Get out.
[41:00.73]I can pull him out of the window.
[41:01.83]Just rip him out of the windshield.
[41:04.51]What is going on with... That guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.
[41:07.47]There's a Mack truck.
[41:10.22]This guy's gonna... Ow.
[41:15.48]Pull him over.
[41:32.24]Time paradox.
[41:36.88]Same game, same engine, same music.
[41:39.44]The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spider-Man.
[41:43.68]Forgot the script to- I guess this one's a slot machine.
[41:55.39]I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.
[42:02.66]Is somebody behind me?
[42:05.26]Somebody's just throwing punches at me.
[42:06.62]Get out of here.
[42:07.24]Are you serious?
[42:12.06]Is he still behind me?
[42:14.90]He died.
[42:18.95]This is another Goalless game.
[42:21.73]This honestly was another Top 5 Funniest Things Ever.
[42:26.87]I literally turned into a cackling witch at the end of this video.
[42:31.53]This went on for so long.
[42:32.72]Alright, hold on, I gotta pause this.
[42:35.24]You know how, like, you've asked before the differences between streaming and YouTube, right?
[42:41.67]Well, the differences between something like this.
[42:44.21]If I streamed this, if I streamed this game and streamed doing this, like, Grand Theft Auto kind of bit, uh...
[42:50.61]This went on for a very long time, went on for fucking, like, this would have, this never was going to stop.
[42:56.71]We could have sat here on stream and watched that for like 30 straight minutes.
[43:04.64]And the differences, I guess, were because I didn't, you don't, I didn't ever want a video to be like a 20, 40 minute long video.
[43:11.84]I cut it down.
[43:14.18]This, we would have been able to see this live happen in complete and total present reality.
[43:21.29]And I could have gotten up, and I would have just left it on the fucking stream.
[43:27.23]I would have left it there for an hour.
[43:31.31]So that would have been the difference, is we would be able to sit there the whole time and let it just play out forever.
[43:37.83]But nevertheless, it was still fucking hysterical.
[43:41.63]You fucking idiots.
[43:42.55]Where are all these people coming from?
[43:44.91]Why the fuck?
[43:46.50]Oh my god.
[43:49.08]This shit was so fucking funny.
[43:50.46]This guy was in slow motion, too.
[43:52.36]People were like... Why?
[43:57.72]This dude's gonna start fighting him?
[44:01.11]Why would you start fighting this guy?
[44:02.81]I don't know.
[44:06.83]I don't understand.
[44:07.69]Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?
[44:16.22]I can sit here and watch.
[44:17.52]It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.
[44:21.13]And then flying forward.
[44:30.89]This went on for so long.
[44:34.84]Just wait till you see.
[44:35.66]Like, if you've ever seen this.
[44:36.86]Oh, I'm going to need a minute after this one.
[44:49.43]I was dying.
[44:50.91]I was fucking crying.
[44:55.47]It's never going to stop.
[44:56.95]This is never going to stop.
[45:04.61]Listen to that.
[45:05.17]I'm like dying.
[45:05.99]I'm going to die.
[45:07.81]I'm seriously going to die.
[45:08.94]I'm going to live through this one.
[45:24.12]This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.
[45:26.30]There's no reason for this to be happening.
[45:36.25]I don't ever want this to end.
[45:38.75]I don't want to hit pause.
[45:40.11]I don't want to hit replay.
[45:41.27]I don't want to stop it.
[45:42.71]But you know what?
[45:44.25]I got to get out of here.
[45:45.05]I have to stop this.
[45:46.32]Wow!
[45:48.60]Is it first ever I got to get out of here?
[45:52.52]Holy shit, that might be first ever.
[45:57.69]Four years ago.
[46:00.49]Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.
[46:03.89]As amazing as this is.
[46:06.34]So, I'll talk.
[46:11.40]Hell yeah.
[46:12.28]Of rewards.
[46:30.23]30?
[46:30.25]29, actually.
[46:30.61]29.
[46:30.73]I think I was like 28 or 29.
[46:34.11]29, I think.
[46:35.61]29, by the way.
[46:36.03]Yeah, we'll play role-playing duck gamers.
[46:50.30]That's an old one, too.
[46:53.54]I think I can just get it through here, can't I?
[46:56.92]I'm like interacting, right?
[47:00.39]Or do I have to re-do this?
[47:05.27]I should be able to... Can I not interact with it?
[47:10.18]Interact.
[47:13.58]Why is it full screen?
[47:14.68]Come on.
[47:16.74]Apparently not.
[47:25.80]No!
[47:26.14]Why are you doing this?
[47:31.48]Well, uh, I will try to pull it from here.
[47:34.38]Roleplaying duck gamers.
[47:41.76]This video was not that long ago either.
[47:43.41]2015.
[47:43.43]2015 was a good year.
[47:43.83]Alright, no ad.
[47:44.63]That's good.
[47:45.01]No ad.
[48:12.72]There wasn't an ad on here!
[48:14.08]There was no ad!
[48:14.90]Alright, here we go.
[48:19.20]This is, uh, Star and I jumped into Duck Game and after, I don't know, maybe like 20 minutes of playing it, we figured out that it was fun just to pretend to talk through the characters' voices by pressing the button that makes you quack.
[48:38.40]And nothing else mattered at that point.
[48:41.92]Nothing mattered.
[48:43.20]Only that.
[48:44.74]So here we go.
[48:45.20]Role playing Duck Gamers.
[48:54.82]What the hell are you doing?
[48:57.57]You dropped your burger on the ground there.
[48:59.97]You dropped your burger on the ground.
[49:02.65]Hey, have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Brothers 2?
[49:07.52]It's pretty cool.
[49:08.78]You see, the main character, Super Mario, he goes like this.
[49:13.20]And he gets it and he wins the game.
[49:15.31]That doesn't even hurt.
[49:16.07]That doesn't even hurt.
[49:18.87]Where's the gun?
[49:20.35]Give me that gun.
[49:22.33]Give me this gun.
[49:23.47]Give me that gun.
[49:25.13]I win.
[49:25.61]That's like more fun.
[49:29.80]You got me.
[49:30.46]Today is your unlucky day, motherfucker.
[49:34.64]Yeah.
[49:35.84]Yeah.
[49:37.02]Oh, yeah.
[49:37.78]Gotcha.
[49:38.52]Gotcha, motherfucker.
[49:41.72]I don't think that's going to stop being funny.
[49:45.58]What's wrong?
[49:46.79]Having some trouble?
[49:48.71]Come on, now.
[49:49.49]What do you got?
[49:50.05]You got a pistol?
[49:50.55]I got a pistol.
[49:50.87]I'm going to shoot you with this pistol.
[49:53.19]Duck.
[49:53.99]Jump.
[49:55.99]Get right.
[49:57.01]I mean, get right.
[50:00.68]it's actually kind of hard it's hard to like hit b and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time it's very hard watch out I got a shotgun I got one too I'm gonna blast you you're gonna blast me you think you're gonna blast me well I'm not gonna now I don't have a shotgun come chase me
[50:18.48]What?

[50:22.06]I don't know.
[50:23.76]Come chase me.
[50:24.64]You're the one with the gun.
[50:26.00]Chase me.
[50:27.08]What a fun thing.
[50:27.86]We're going to do it just like they used to do in the old times.
[50:31.26]Back to back, ten paces.
[50:34.65]Turn around.
[50:36.03]Okay.
[50:36.97]In ten paces.
[50:38.57]Go.
[50:39.47]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[50:46.49]Die.
[50:46.69]Die.
[50:48.84]Mishcalculation.
[50:49.46]My die was like eight syllables.
[50:51.81]Fuck.
[50:52.59]That's your fucking Earthworm.
[50:53.75]My die was eight syllables.
[50:55.81]Look, look, this is the gun from Earthworm Jim.
[50:57.91]Cool, huh?
[50:59.99]Cool.
[51:00.71]Duck game on Steam.
[51:02.18]Currently part of the Steam sale.
[51:03.74]Pick it up today.
[51:04.62]You're gonna have fun with all your friends.
[51:06.91]Like this guy.
[51:07.69]He's my friend.
[51:08.61]But is he really, though?
[51:09.63]I don't know.
[51:10.21]Could he be?
[51:10.63]I have no idea.
[51:11.57]Friends.
[51:12.53]I love friends.
[51:13.05]Fuck this video.
[51:13.97]Fuck this whole thing.
[51:15.43]This whole thing sucks.

[55:21.81]she wanted to see me at uh well you're really this up aren't you it turns into animal are we the aliens to that planet makes sense in my opinion although a more existential way to look at it is probably like this
[55:49.31]Man, can you believe Carol?
[55:50.65]Carol in accounting?
[55:52.15]Man, she really gave me the riot accident.
[55:57.68]Yeah, you do.
[55:59.34]I don't know why you've been doing that.
[56:00.88]Seems kind of expensive.
[56:07.53]Alright, I'm ready.
[56:09.99]Okay, I'm gonna catch her in my mouth.
[56:12.11]Didn't we just do this?

[56:25.05]Those videos are so much fun to make.
[56:47.57]Oh, speaking of Star, you'll be pleased to know that we're probably going to play something fairly soon.
[57:00.23]I actually just talked to him, like, a few days ago.
[57:04.05]So, Jerma and Star, everybody wants to see this fucking happen.
[57:09.89]I'm not playing that video, though.
[57:10.95]That's an embarrassing, that's an embarrassment to me video.
[57:15.43]uh yeah we were talking about just playing some ram stuff so this should be fun do it do it do it no I can't do it without them dropping too many frames you wouldn't even be able to see it uh tactical intervention that's another one that was I want to like oh
[57:42.46]Yeah, we gotta watch the Tactical Intervention video.
[57:44.82]That video is fucked.
[57:46.08]That game is fucked.
[57:49.86]That game is INSANE.
[58:02.11]If you type Tactical Intervention, it stars- stars- star in my videos of what happens here.
[58:21.22]Alright, let's load it up.
[58:26.16]Jarba is mad.
[58:26.88]Part 3!
[58:27.52]Alright, let me open this up.
[58:37.55]Which this should... What's this on here?
[58:42.85]How many of those did he make?
[58:44.79]He made a lot of those, didn't he?
[58:50.72]I got it.
[58:51.58]I caught it before it could happen.
[58:55.84]I saved you from watching the ghost recon breakpoint explode inside of your ears ad video.
[59:05.28]Why am I getting two ads back to back?
[59:08.92]What is up with this?
[59:10.26]Since when?
[59:10.70]Alright.
[59:14.84]Here we go.
[59:25.90]Three, two, one, play it!
[59:36.82]It's just... It's just showing us the scenery.
[59:39.58]Yeah, why is it just... Okay, here we go.
[59:42.39]Oh god, this is so loud.
[59:43.49]Why is it so loud?
[59:44.47]Every game is loud.
[59:45.41]And now you're wicked loud again.
[59:49.31]Siren.
[59:50.53]You are so loud.
[59:53.71]I guess I'm ready.
[59:56.62]This siren does not stop for the entire video.
[60:00.15]This is the loudest game ever.
[60:03.84]Are you driving?
[60:04.78]I'm in your car.
[60:08.37]Are you behind me?
[60:10.03]Yeah, I'm... That shit's fucking so stupid.
[60:20.14]Everything is so loud.
[60:22.02]You are so loud.
[60:23.66]You are so loud right now.
[60:26.66]I'm sorry.
[60:27.39]Your microphone is so fucked.
[60:30.73]Hey, look at this car.
[60:33.61]I can't control this.
[60:36.41]What is the objective?
[60:41.23]I'm passing out!
[60:43.72]I'm passing out, dude!
[60:45.42]The world is closing in.
[60:48.66]The world is closing in.
[60:56.10]It started to see black like I was fainting.
[60:58.46]Do we get out?
[61:04.20]No, no don't get out, don't get out.
[61:08.22]I can't, I got out!
[61:10.28]No, I'm driving!
[61:12.13]We won!
[61:14.45]And we won the game.
[61:15.51]Alright, so something really important because the thing with making a video is after the fact,
[61:27.55]there was three tracks, right?
[61:29.57]There was the game audio, there was my audio, and there was Starz audio.
[61:33.48]So every time you'd make a video, you'd have three different audio timelines in your editing software.
[61:41.10]So to be able to have this video actually play audibly,
[61:46.49]In any video, it didn't matter which one it was.
[61:48.45]You played with the audio levels to make it so the tracks weren't too overbearing or too horrible.
[61:53.81]This video, what you're hearing does not do justice to how loud this actually was.
[61:57.11]This had to be dropped, like, 75%.
[61:59.44]To not be completely blowing out every single person's eardrums that watched the video.
[62:06.60]So, like, how loud this was, his, and not just the game, for some reason, his microphone was like, I'm gonna peak and break and be loud as fuck too.
[62:19.63]It was just... Listen to when he says, we win.
[62:21.75]You can hear his mic crying.
[62:23.71]Do we get out?
[62:28.69]No, no, don't get out.
[62:30.79]I can't.
[62:31.41]I got out.
[62:32.87]No, I'm driving.
[62:33.87]We win.
[62:35.81]Do you hear that?
[62:38.73]It's so bad.
[62:43.63]Peek your mic.
[62:44.29]Peek your mic.
[62:45.69]Yeah.
[62:46.31]We're off.
[62:46.79]We're on.
[62:47.43]We're off.
[62:47.77]We're on.
[62:50.32]Highway mode was so good.
[62:53.96]Some of these first experiences in these games, I'll never forget that.
[63:00.49]I will never forget how funny that was.
[63:03.35]We didn't even know what we were playing.
[63:06.05]It was just like, let's play this.
[63:07.15]This sounds like fun.
[63:08.33]It's by the guy that made Counter-Strike, right?
[63:10.85]That's what you knew when you went into that.
[63:13.13]That's all you knew.
[63:15.77]So, guy that made Counter-Strike made this game.
[63:18.85]Oh, let's play it together and maybe we'll record it.
[63:21.31]This is what happens.
[63:24.09]It's just... It's wonderful.
[63:27.90]I haven't played it in a long time.
[63:29.56]Didn't they do... They redid it.
[63:31.06]Didn't they remake a bunch of it?
[63:35.60]But that's the thing people say.
[63:37.24]Like, oh, video games and playing with people and your friends and getting calls.
[63:41.62]Like that's the kind of shit that you want to take away from that.
[63:44.76]You know what I mean?
[63:47.44]Even when I'm like 80 years old, I will always remember that first like 25 minutes in tactical intervention.
[63:53.75]I just will.
[63:54.57]I know I will.
[63:55.17]Because it was fucking so unbelievable.
[63:58.13]It was so ridiculous.
[64:03.14]Did it shut down?
[64:04.84]Yeah.
[64:05.08]Oh, the server shut down.
[64:05.86]That's too bad.
[64:09.21]But, uh, let's continue through the video.
[64:23.28]Here we go.
[64:26.94]What the fuck is this, James?
[64:30.39]Hold on, I'm not ready.
[64:32.59]I'm not ready.
[64:33.19]I need to fix this audio.
[64:35.49]It's so... Oh...
[64:39.51]Deep fried star.
[64:41.27]Oh, hold on.
[64:43.83]Options.
[64:44.95]Audio.
[64:45.63]Jeez, bring the master volume down.
[64:47.29]You're the driver.
[64:48.47]Wait, I'm driving.
[64:49.19]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[64:50.51]Come on.
[64:52.17]How do I drive?
[64:54.75]Watch out, this guy's behind us.
[64:56.37]How do I drive?
[64:57.23]This guy drives like a piece of shit.
[65:00.35]It was pretty bad.
[65:01.69]Why do you get arrows pointing?
[65:03.79]Yeah, why do I get the GPS?
[65:05.15]You didn't get the GPS.
[65:05.91]I'm getting out.
[65:10.21]Somebody was still in the back, I remember.
[65:13.01]Like the VIP is in the backseat.
[65:23.69]The guy in the backseat wasn't even in the call.
[65:26.13]He's just like, what?
[65:28.74]What am I supposed to do?
[65:29.86]The game just released.
[65:31.40]I don't know what the fuck to do.
[65:35.03]I'm just watching some guy drive us He was sitting in the backseat just sitting there You are a fucking asshole This is the best thing ever It really is How's this guy doing?
[65:54.81]He looks like he's- Oh, boo!
[65:56.73]He's just like looking at me, just beeping He's just-
[66:11.09]He had a blank expression.
[66:17.19]He blew out of the car and then backflipped.
[66:20.53]Oh, I'm just getting out.
[66:25.56]I'm done.
[66:26.14]That's a VIP.
[66:27.02]I think that's Mela.
[66:34.76]He's alive!
[66:36.08]The BMP's alive!
[66:37.06]That makes no sense!
[66:43.30]It's like foot!
[66:46.34]He's squashed in there.
[66:47.34]He's like sitting on the dash.
[66:50.56]Watch out!
[66:52.91]It's a game!
[66:54.30]I can't take it anymore.
[66:55.35]I gotta get out of here.
[66:56.47]Wait, what the hell?
[66:57.85]That's the first gotta get out of here.
[67:01.61]Like five people just gunned him down, like surrounded him and just started firing.
[67:06.77]Alright, I'm driving.
[67:08.10]I'm going fast.
[67:09.06]I got the need for speed.
[67:11.12]Wait, get out of the car.
[67:12.68]Get out of the car.
[67:13.56]Get out of the car.
[67:14.76]That's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car.
[67:17.48]I'm jacked.
[67:18.08]Oh, he's right.
[67:19.34]Get me the...
[67:21.01]I remember I had to go to bed after this.
[67:51.74]This is one of those scenarios.
[67:52.64]We played, I don't know, this is like five minutes.
[67:53.96]We probably played for a couple hours, two, three hours maybe.
[67:57.10]Maybe a little bit more.
[67:58.98]And I distinctly remember being hungover.
[68:02.54]That happens to me.
[68:03.52]It does.
[68:06.20]I don't make that shit up.
[68:08.64]When I laugh to a point where I fucking start crying and shit, or I start to fade out, I get stream and video hungover.
[68:21.59]I get, like, comedy hungover.
[68:24.23]I really do.
[68:29.29]Seriously, we were at the ready screen, it got wicked loud.
[68:34.22]That was just too much, like, too much stimulation.
[68:37.40]The last time I faded out, for real, actually truly faded out, was during The Sims 4 mod night.
[68:44.38]During the dog peeing shit.
[68:45.58]Like, the guy on drugs with his dogs.
[68:48.19]That is the last time that I actually like got fucking video game hungover.
[68:55.56]I just, the dog rolling around in its own piss and the guy on drugs walking the dog in his own house.
[69:02.40]Like I was blacking out.
[69:07.25]I came pretty close a few more times, like recently.
[69:11.60]But then like that, I don't know man, like later on that night, you just kind of... You're just like, fucking god, it feels like you just got run over by a car.
[69:20.03]The farts and screams, I didn't black out during that.
[69:22.27]I started like, welling up a little bit here.
[69:25.31]But... Those mods.
[69:29.73]The first handful of those mods.
[69:32.63]Ugh.
[69:35.71]I remember I actually had, yeah, eject, but I wasn't blacking out there.
[69:38.90]It...
[69:40.37]I have a distinct memory of taking my headphones out.
[69:44.08]I think I said it a few times, like, I have to leave the room.
[69:46.36]I turned around, I, like, got out of the fucking chair and I, like, walked over here to just get away from the desk.
[69:57.07]I love this shit, like, it...
[70:01.06]It has to be constant laughter for a little while because if you expel like enough laughter, you laugh enough and then you like get back.
[70:10.97]But if something else happens that you see when you're in the middle of desperately trying to come back, that's where you get like comedy injured.
[70:20.10]You see something or something plays out in your head over and over again where you think about it over and over again in your head of why you think it's so funny.
[70:31.07]But this just reminds me, and even from streams too, this just reminds me just how much fun some of this shit just truly is.
[70:40.24]I fucking, I love this shit.
[70:44.96]It's fucking so much fun.
[70:49.18]Hyperventa laughing, yeah.
[70:52.70]The laugh just keeps punching you.
[70:53.98]Wait, how does this one end?
[70:55.50]Of the brain.
[70:57.62]My old screen.
[71:00.43]Subscribe for more.
[71:01.43]Like if you did.
[71:02.39]If you did.
[71:06.05]I only like if you did.
[71:07.59]If you liked.
[71:08.11]If you didn't like it, then you didn't have to like it.
[71:11.30]But I like it if you did.
[71:12.24]I hated that one.
[71:19.00]Well, I hope you didn't like the video then.
[71:31.97]Have I watched all Starz videos?
[71:33.45]Oh, I've seen every single one of his videos.
[71:40.35]Let me go... Alright, what's next?
[71:46.17]Jerma Rumble?
[71:46.55]No, no Jerma Rumble.
[71:47.35]I feel like we've... Jerma Rumble has been seen plenty of times.
[71:52.43]I want to kind of revisit some of the old ones that I haven't watched in a while.
[71:59.13]Okay.
[72:03.73]Raven's Cry?
[72:04.67]Oh, man.
[72:06.27]That's an old one.
[72:09.98]Raven's Cry is fucking crazy.
[72:12.58]Which one, though?
[72:13.14]I did two videos on that game.
[72:18.80]I made two Raven's Cry videos because they've remade it.
[72:31.99]Wait, did I?
[72:34.76]Ravens... did... did I make two videos on Raven's Cry?
[72:38.49]Yeah, yes, yes, yes, I did, okay, I tell you, I did.
[72:47.01]This is Raven's Cry as a finished game.
[72:51.39]Be brave, yeah.

[75:08.87]Alright, this really does sound like... It sounds like somebody was just at like a bar drinking with their buddies and held a microphone in front of someone or their friends and was just like, hey, can you... Can you...
[75:26.45]Can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?
[75:29.99]Horses asses.
[75:33.09]Horses asses.
[75:34.53]Alright, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.
[75:41.73]This is all he does.
[75:42.73]There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.
[75:47.84]See, he's telling us to be brave and at the same sentence he's calling us names.
[75:54.20]Which one is it?
[75:56.53]We're sinking.
[75:59.73]He's sinking.
[76:14.55]Sinking into the sea.

[76:23.54]First I'm gonna stab him.
[76:24.88]And then I'm gonna butt him.
[76:26.24]And then I'm gonna butt him again.
[76:27.68]And then I'm gonna butt him again.
[76:29.10]And then I'm gonna stab him.
[76:30.48]And then I'm gonna stab him.
[76:35.37]I guess a couple of drinks would make me figure this all out.
[76:40.19]Why does it keep telling me to do the fear skill?
[76:43.16]Do I have to... I did not mean to shoot that guy.
[76:45.04]Didn't mean to kill that guy.
[76:45.86]I really didn't.
[76:46.44]I'm trying to do the fear skill.
[76:48.70]Nobody seems to care, though.
[76:49.80]Apparently that guy... Nobody cares about that guy.
[76:53.02]Everyone's cool.
[76:53.64]We're alright.
[76:54.16]We're good.
[76:54.44]Oh, look.
[76:57.19]A guy's sleeping on the dock.
[76:58.99]What do you know?
[77:00.74]I don't want to fight these guys.
[77:26.45]You quacks.
[77:27.69]That's my favorite one.
[77:28.99]My favorite one.
[77:30.03]Be brave, you quacks.
[77:32.75]You quacks.
[77:34.53]That's the best one.
[77:36.30]That is absolutely the funniest one.
[77:43.28]I don't want to fight these guys.
[77:45.70]I'm riding around like a dinghy boat.
[77:47.62]Why quacks?
[77:48.36]These guys are shooting like 300.
[77:50.10]Oh my god.
[77:52.27]Be brave.
[77:52.83]There's no way I'm gonna be able to fight these guys.
[77:56.45]I just had like two percent.
[77:57.83]I did like not even one percent damage.
[77:59.91]We're like instantly getting killed.
[78:02.55]I can't even turn the wheel.
[78:06.21]It's all your fault, you numb skull.
[78:08.31]No.
[78:14.71]Who's saying you need me?
[78:19.04]Why is that the fucking reverse of yeah?
[78:22.94]No.
[78:25.00]No.
[78:25.70]No.
[78:28.64]Oh shit, there's a prisoner in here.
[78:30.84]Get me out of here!
[78:33.73]That's not a very secure prison.
[78:38.43]Just go the other way.
[78:40.17]I don't even know what that means.
[78:43.53]You just said a nonsense statement.
[78:45.37]Just please go out the door.
[78:47.25]Yeah, get on your way.
[78:48.03]Go.
[78:49.55]I'm gonna block this side of the door so you have to fucking go this way.
[78:54.20]I'm sorry, I'm on my way.
[78:59.44]Go.
[78:59.58]Turd sniffer?
[79:00.36]Did he just call me a turd sniffer?
[79:05.30]They're all, like, bumbling all over each other and, like, saying excuse me and, like, oh, I don't want any trouble.
[79:09.64]Whoa, oh, oh!
[79:16.78]Somebody just said... Discord voice chat.
[79:20.58]Ugh.
[79:43.54]That's all I hear.
[79:45.84]This is literally the only- That's all I fucking hear right now.
[79:48.60]It's making me want to die.
[79:50.58]Go, go, go, go, go.
[79:52.98]Discord voice chat.
[79:55.85]That's so fucking funny.
[79:57.09]You cannot be serious right now.
[80:07.73]Hey, let's go to voice one.
[80:11.29]Voice one.
[80:12.38]Anybody in here?
[80:13.00]You cannot be serious.
[80:48.91]Crash my computer.
[80:57.58]My computer is locked up right now.
[81:07.92]mine too who crashed all of our computers my Discord I my computer's locked up right now I'm still stuck here I have
[81:41.18]I can't do anything.
[81:44.30]Okay.
[81:45.74]Anyways.
[81:49.38]That's so funny.
[81:51.12]No joke, dad.
[81:51.94]Somebody fucking broke the Discord with... There he is right now.
[82:02.14]What?
[82:07.72]I can't believe that somebody just broke the Discord.
[82:13.98]What if it just shuts down forever?
[82:15.80]What if we never get it back?
[82:19.57]Wait a second.
[82:20.45]Don't even tell me.
[82:22.43]Oh yeah, people just peed.
[82:24.11]People just pee in bushes.
[82:25.75]No.
[82:26.23]I forgot about this.
[82:28.11]Yeah, this is a lady pissing into a bush.
[82:30.19]I completely forgot that people would just pee.
[82:32.77]God, they keep tempting me.
[82:34.05]Stop tempting me with this.
[82:36.20]Come on.
[82:37.87]I don't want to do this.
[82:39.51]They keep putting them in the perfect spot for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.
[82:45.15]Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?
[82:48.15]Look, again.
[82:49.17]And this guy's pissing.
[82:53.00]No, he's not.
[82:54.04]What is this guy doing?
[82:54.80]He's puking, right?
[82:57.88]Oh, he's throwing up.
[82:58.94]He's throwing up into an invisible ground.
[83:04.03]That was mean.
[83:05.47]That guy was sick.
[83:07.63]He was ill.
[83:09.11]Wait, was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?
[83:10.63]You guys notice something?
[83:19.02]Anything seem a little off to you guys?
[83:21.32]At all?
[83:22.40]Just listen.
[83:24.38]They patched him out of the game.
[83:32.46]The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.
[83:36.04]They removed... This is all new dialog on the boat.
[83:39.82]Anytime you go on the boat now, it's this.
[83:42.76]What were the patch notes?
[83:43.92]Did they say like, oh, we removed the scream, swears, be brave guy.
[83:47.89]We apologize for his uncalled for insults.
[83:52.37]And he has been removed.
[83:53.33]I want him back.
[83:54.55]Where is he?
[83:55.43]He was an integral part of my crew.
[83:57.49]He was.
[83:57.93]He was like the best.
[83:59.81]They patched him up.
[84:02.95]I remember because I was recording over, like, a few days here, like, it's probably, like, I typically would play the game for, like, a few hours, take out some things that I thought were fun, play for, like, another hour or two the next day, or take, edit some stuff together and be making the kind of video as I went along.
[84:17.50]And it just, they changed the game, like, halfway through when I was making the video.
[84:24.31]It was really weird.
[84:36.43]Scare Saturdays.
[84:37.57]Hold on, let me go over here.
[84:50.55]Ratburger, we'll do Ratburger.
[84:52.77]I haven't seen that one in a long time either.
[85:06.60]Uh, let's see.
[85:11.22]Welcome to RET 5.
[85:13.10]More than 5 years ago.
[85:14.12]This was March 18th, 2014.
[85:16.96]Yeah, this is 5 years ago now.
[85:22.86]That's a long, long time ago.
[85:24.92]I was just a young man. ...
[85:36.18]Hold on.
[85:41.89]I was just a young boy back then.
[85:43.79]Let's fill this like that.
[85:55.18]Okay.
[85:57.28]Let's take a look.
[85:59.62]Bratburger.
[86:00.08]Bratburger.
[86:05.48]29 is still young adult.
[86:06.36]Haven't you guys played Alter Ego?
[86:07.80]I know, haven't you played Alter Ego?
[86:19.13]Hi.
[86:22.77]Where do we make the cheeseburgers?
[86:27.48]I love how we each have a different... Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[86:30.57]Stealth.
[86:30.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[86:31.61]Do not just start... This is... What are you doing?
[86:33.69]That's not me.
[86:34.37]Oh, shit.
[86:36.44]Why are you Star's girlfriend?
[86:38.06]No, no, no.
[86:38.40]I thought we were doing the date.
[86:40.70]Oh, yeah.
[86:41.04]Alright.
[86:43.98]Something important to note here is...
[86:46.63]This game was so early in its development.
[86:48.71]It was like a super alpha.
[86:50.45]There was no restart.
[86:52.49]There was no redo game or do a reset or you had to physically, everyone had to close the game to get these cheeseburgers back up here on the shelf.
[87:06.69]You had to close, everyone had to close out their games, everyone had to restart their games, and the process to get anybody into a server was this crazy roundabout, there was like three servers that existed, I think, in the whole game.
[87:18.29]It was a Unity browser game that was hard to get people in multiplayer.
[87:24.37]So, it was, this was very hard, this took us like, I remember like, two hours had gone by at this point, and we finally fucking got it in, got it to work, and we were all ready to record.
[87:35.62]Remember, if you fucked it up, we had to do the whole thing again.
[87:38.99]So... Like, that's why I'm like, don't, don't, don't, don't!
[87:41.53]What the fuck are you doing?
[87:42.45]Please!
[87:43.31]Just because we would have to start over.
[87:46.41]Didn't Star wake up in the middle of his sleep?
[87:48.10]Yeah, I... We needed a fourth person.
[87:51.35]So I just, like, hit up Star, like, I texted him, I'm like, Hey, dude, come play this burger game, it's gonna be fun.
[87:56.52]He was asleep, and I was like, come on, play this game, please!
[87:59.16]And I woke him up, he was in a dead sleep.
[88:01.88]And within, I don't know, maybe like 30 minutes or 20 minutes of being awake, I was like, we're trying to, multiplayer, just get in, here's, like, the server, here's what you have to do, and he was just barely awake at this point.
[88:14.15]Let's just start over. ...
[88:21.53]Hi.
[88:23.25]He just didn't want to be here at all.
[88:24.57]And he didn't give a fuck if he was going to fuck it all up.
[88:28.87]So what's the first thing he does?
[88:29.91]I love how we each have a different.
[88:31.61]Alright.
[88:31.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:32.97]Stealth.
[88:33.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[88:34.01]Do not just start.
[88:34.69]This is what he's doing.
[88:36.11]That's not me.
[88:36.82]Oh, shit.
[88:38.84]Why are you Star's girlfriend?
[88:40.18]He's like, no, no, no.
[88:41.86]I thought we were doing the date.
[88:43.14]Oh, yeah.
[88:45.44]He's just doing his own thing.
[88:46.66]I can't control.
[88:47.52]He's just, okay.
[88:48.28]Star is just doing his own thing this whole video.
[88:52.15]He's just not even in this video.
[88:54.61]He's just doing his own thing.
[88:57.67]You have to turn your DPI down.
[89:00.75]I can't find my mouse sensitivity.
[89:05.98]It's so high.
[89:06.94]Alright, you are seriously messing this whole thing up, you guys.
[89:10.22]We were supposed to build burgers.
[89:11.48]You guys are just taking all the ingredients and throwing them all over the place.
[89:14.60]We have customers.
[89:18.07]I'm going to say hi.
[89:18.89]Look, you need to look at, like, the note board to see what we have to do.
[89:24.83]I'm just watching Star, like, literally just hold his hands out and just hold left to right as he goes down the road.
[89:32.27]What are you doing?
[89:35.49]I'm trying to fix this shit.
[89:38.01]You have just, like, single-handedly destroyed what we were doing.
[89:44.98]Can we actually make a burger, or are you guys just gonna be dipshits this whole time?
[89:49.84]Look, come out here.
[89:51.38]You sprint.
[89:52.05]You can sprint.
[89:54.51]I think that just changed the field of view.
[89:56.59]I had this grand idea that we were going to have like a burger contest and do some, maybe like some light RP, right?
[90:06.37]They were just fucking throwing shit on the grill.
[90:12.03]I had this, like this grand idea.
[90:17.37]Girl, are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?
[90:20.81]Look at, come out here.
[90:22.36]You sprint.
[90:23.04]You can sprint.
[90:25.50]I think that just changed the field of view.
[90:26.94]There are people out here looking for cheeseburgers.
[90:28.66]This guy wants a bacon burger.
[90:29.92]Alright, we gotta set this up.
[90:31.06]This guy wants a bacon burger.
[90:32.18]This guy wants... There's so many people in here.
[90:36.92]There's like six people in here.
[90:43.94]There is a burger patty.
[90:45.22]She's not happy.
[90:45.98]Alright, who wanted the lettuce?
[90:48.98]No, nobody... Alright, seriously.
[90:50.94]Meeting.
[90:51.26]Team meeting.
[90:54.69]Team meeting.
[90:56.17]Uh-oh, the manager is displeased.
[90:57.67]I am not happy.
[90:58.54]You guys, one of you guys is getting fired.
[91:02.72]Hey, look at all this stuff on the grill.
[91:04.70]Yeah, it's all burnt.
[91:05.46]Go to the front desk.
[91:06.30]Go to the front.
[91:06.93]I got a burger.
[91:08.43]Wait, what do you mean?
[91:09.15]What are you talking about?
[91:20.70]He took the patty.
[91:22.70]Catch it, someone.
[91:23.92]I caught it.
[91:25.02]She's still in the restaurant.
[91:27.48]She's still there.
[91:28.60]Where's my burger?
[91:30.92]Oh, he snagged it.
[91:33.28]Look at this trail of rats.
[91:34.76]It's like a rat fight.
[91:37.49]They're all going after this one piece of meat.
[91:40.81]This one guy.
[91:42.99]Don't let him get away.
[91:45.13]We are chasing this rat all the way down the street.
[91:48.62]Come here, you son of a bitch!
[91:51.74]I got it!
[91:53.06]I got the rat!
[91:57.20]Look at all these people just watching.
[92:01.30]We caught the wrong one.
[92:02.38]Can we actually play this game?
[92:05.64]We're not.
[92:06.28]Hold on, everyone get in the back.
[92:08.56]These rats are burned.
[92:10.30]They are crisp.
[92:15.09]They're not even, they're dead, they're black.
[92:16.85]Hey guys, it's okay, we can finish the rat burger, I found the patty.
[92:19.71]These rats are burned.
[92:21.15]Get the rat and put it on the bun.
[92:28.85]I'm crying right now.
[92:31.27]This is so, this is so stupid.
[92:34.25]Okay, can we please restart this and just like, I don't have any fucking rats everywhere.
[92:38.90]How do I, how do I get the rat?
[92:43.31]How do you- I don't even know how you draw, like, how do you, like, even control this?
[92:46.71]I think it screws up in multiplayer.
[92:49.44]Yeah, just, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[92:51.60]And then that's, did I just- It looks like a two-year-old drawing.
[92:56.10]You're holding two?
[92:57.00]Alright.
[92:58.62]So.
[92:58.80]Alright, no, no, no.
[92:59.54]Follow me, though.
[93:00.18]There is a prisoner back here.
[93:02.24]There's a person back here.
[93:03.16]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[93:04.92]What are you doing?
[93:05.74]We just remade this game!
[93:08.29]Remember, keep in mind, keep in mind, we just started this again.
[93:12.22]This was like a, alright, three, two, one, let's go, right?
[93:17.70]Immediately, the first thing he fucking does.
[93:19.50]We've been, not even two minutes.
[93:21.22]A prisoner back here.
[93:22.88]There's a person back here.
[93:23.80]Oh my God, you fucking idiot.
[93:25.56]What are you doing?
[93:26.40]We just remade this game.
[93:28.48]Why?
[93:32.31]You, you're fired.
[93:35.21]There's a person.
[93:35.85]What, there's a guy in here.
[93:37.03]I know, that's what I was saying.
[93:38.67]What's wrong with this guy?
[93:41.14]Can we, like, punch him?
[93:42.50]He is the rat mama.
[93:44.47]Can I pick him up?
[93:45.31]What if you could pick him up and, like, make, like, a person sandwich?
[93:49.68]No, I... Oh, no.
[93:51.88]Alright.
[93:52.32]You can lock people in here.
[93:53.98]No.
[93:54.42]We all conspired against you.
[93:57.00]Yeah, it's just like all at once.
[93:59.44]No one said anything.
[94:00.72]I'm very happy with our teamwork.
[94:02.56]I am completely locked.
[94:03.70]There's no way I'm getting out of this.
[94:05.52]We did that very silently.
[94:07.02]We all knew.
[94:07.76]You dicks.
[94:08.18]It's just me and like this weird Herman guy back here now.
[94:10.50]Is it like lettuce bricks?
[94:11.15]I don't even know what that's supposed to be.
[94:14.41]It's like fighting through the shrubbery.
[94:17.35]I'm fighting through.
[94:18.37]No, he's bringing the rats.
[94:24.39]Also, we're wearing bandanas and look like pirates.
[94:26.25]Again, take three.
[94:29.01]Okay, Star, you're not allowed to look.
[94:31.81]Not allowed to look?
[94:32.71]No, because you're the burger judge.
[94:34.03]There's people coming in.
[94:35.03]There's customers.
[94:36.47]I'll talk.
[94:37.13]Do you see what I did here?
[94:38.23]This is some fucking 4D chess.
[94:40.23]Star, you're the judge.
[94:41.55]You have to be on the other side.
[94:43.87]You have to be on the other side, not in the kitchen.
[94:49.67]I made sure to get him out of the kitchen.
[94:52.61]No, because you're the burger judge.
[94:54.01]There's people coming in.
[94:54.93]There's customers.
[94:56.37]I'll talk the people down.
[94:57.21]You got to show them to their seats.
[94:58.63]I'll lower their expectations.
[95:00.27]Lower their expectations because they're going to probably throw up after eating one of our burgers.
[95:04.64]I'm going to go.
[95:05.54]You look mad.
[95:06.30]Oh, I picked something up.
[95:07.58]Yeah, still, we have to make burgers.
[95:08.88]We have to make our own delicious cheeseburger.
[95:10.70]You must be proud of yourself.
[95:12.59]My second rule.
[95:13.43]Start with the bun.
[95:14.72]And, hey, I have... Everyone get away from each other, because we're just going to knock into stuff.
[95:18.94]I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.
[95:22.26]So here's my burger station.
[95:24.06]It's going to be right next to the sink.
[95:27.08]In the bathroom.
[95:28.22]Yeah.
[95:28.64]I'll be in the bathroom.
[95:29.44]You can use the bad controller?
[95:31.28]What's that?
[95:32.70]Oh, well, the cheese is completely... My cheese, seriously, is just like a black tile.
[95:36.68]You don't put the cheese on the grill.
[95:38.04]I wanted to, like, melt it.
[95:38.95]You don't put...
[95:40.69]You can put cheese on the grill.
[95:41.95]Hey, well, get out of my station.
[95:43.05]You can put cheese on the grill.
[95:44.03]You?
[95:44.37]For a second.
[95:45.01]No, you can't.
[95:45.45]Can you?
[95:45.73]Dick.
[95:47.47]You son of a bitch.
[95:49.98]He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.
[95:53.50]Hey, hey, you don't gotta, you gotta play to win.
[95:55.88]Oh, my.
[95:56.46]Free for all.
[95:57.74]Uh, never, um.
[96:00.93]Star, just pretend like you didn't hear that.
[96:02.43]It's a Krabby Patty.
[96:04.07]What are you doing back here?
[96:05.53]How are you, like, multiplying these bacons, Star?
[96:07.81]True.
[96:09.40]Come back here.
[96:11.26]What's going on?
[96:11.88]I know how to break everything.
[96:13.86]Where are you?
[96:14.56]I'm in the back room.
[96:16.22]He's duping.
[96:17.25]What the hell?
[96:20.51]How did you get all this bacon?
[96:21.23]I'm the Baconator.
[96:22.17]I'm the Baconator.
[96:23.59]Who's under the ground?
[96:24.65]Jeremy, you're under the ground.
[96:25.65]Oh, no.
[96:30.47]We didn't get to do the thing I wanted to do.
[96:35.25]Where am I?
[96:36.77]I don't know.
[96:38.91]Somebody else fell.
[96:39.80]Somebody else fell.
[96:43.16]You can see the tiny little guy fall.
[96:45.44]Who just fell?
[96:47.80]You went whizzing by my screen.
[96:52.48]Yeah.
[96:55.08]I wanted to make like cheeseburgers instead of a cheeseburger contest.
[96:59.97]Apparently not, though.
[97:08.24]Jeremiah is reliving his frustrations.
[97:14.18]He's doing it all over again.
[97:15.18]He's seeing why he was so angry.
[97:20.18]Spy party?
[97:27.39]The new, uh, what about the New Vegas Time Gun?
[97:31.31]I haven't seen that in a long time, but that one, that was fucking crazy.
[97:38.22]Fun facts for everybody here.
[97:39.90]If you are a new viewer to the stream, that is, uh, that is one of the first streams I ever did moving to Twitch.
[97:51.00]Very early.
[97:51.68]I think that was, had to have been the first five to ten streams ever, right?
[97:57.21]It's another one of those where I start to not be able to breathe.
[98:01.26]I can't control myself.
[98:03.89]Let's try.
[98:04.43]Let's watch it.
[98:06.53]Didn't you stream Minecraft in like 2012?
[98:08.31]No, I had like a Twitch account.
[98:10.47]I had like an old Twitch account and I would use it sometimes.
[98:13.17]I streamed on YouTube sometimes, but it wasn't until like 2014 that I moved and started doing Twitch seriously, like taking it very seriously and streaming three or four times a week.
[98:25.28]And that was like late 2014, I think, right?
[98:30.82]YouTube streaming, yeah.
[98:33.74]It wasn't very good when I was doing it.
[98:35.34]That's why I chose to do Twitch instead.
[98:37.30]Internet, come on.
[98:47.53]Let's close this.
[98:53.13]My title changed, right?
[98:59.68]Yeah, I'm just making sure the title actually changed.
[99:02.08]Alright, what are we going to do?
[99:03.53]We're going to do this one.
[99:12.35]Stop.
[99:20.80]There we go.
[99:24.51]Stop.
[99:28.74]Stop wasting my time.
[99:30.56]Alright, here we go.
[99:43.26]This is all streamed.
[99:44.08]So this is going to be... So I streamed this at a low bitrate, too.
[99:51.03]This is back like 2500, I think, bitrate.
[99:56.45]I stream now at 6000.
[100:02.15]this is old bitrate that was pulled and made into a video now being streamed through through Twitch again with like shitty internet problems today this is gonna be interesting we'll see how this looks here we go right oh wait I know you're gonna hear that line like four times but hold on let me is this
[100:31.73]God damn it.
[100:32.89]I knew it was frozen for... I knew it was frozen.
[100:35.97]I knew it was frozen.
[100:41.19]There we go.
[100:43.33]Oh, come on.
[100:44.68]No, don't be frozen, please.
[100:52.74]Sorry.
[100:54.42]Sometimes when I interact with a browser, it freezes the whole thing.
[100:59.77]I don't know why.
[101:17.30]okay alright there we go finally put it on the screen geez that took long enough here we go go waste jasons
[101:46.02]Fuck you.
[101:46.52]I came here for a mission.
[101:48.54]And I'm gonna do my mission.
[101:50.75]You fucking ghouls.
[101:52.31]So should I just fucking kill this guy?
[101:55.85]You got it.
[101:58.54]I missed.
[102:01.08]Don't move.
[102:01.38]Don't move, sir.
[102:03.42]I was just playing with you.
[102:04.76]I just didn't want you to know that this was coming for you.
[102:14.93]run, but you can't hide.
[102:19.23]Let's get in it.
[102:21.15]Also, very important to note.
[102:22.31]This is important to note.
[102:25.70]This is the first time I've ever played Fallout New Vegas, and I just... I was just fucking killing people.
[102:33.22]I just was, like, slaughtering people.
[102:35.36]And I didn't... No, I never ended up finishing Fallout New Vegas.
[102:40.68]Because...
[102:42.52]I got to a point where I was spawning 500 EZP's.
[102:48.31]And I couldn't play it anymore.
[102:49.35]I couldn't do it.
[102:50.29]I can't play Skyrim anymore either.
[102:54.97]I've said it before.
[102:56.03]Anytime someone's like, hey, cheat, add this, do this.
[102:58.91]At some point, you've ruined the whole thing and you can never play the game normal ever again.
[103:07.88]Step in that asshole, Larry.
[103:09.78]Step inside that asshole, Larry.
[103:11.66]I'm so lost in here!
[103:14.96]Where the fuck do I go?
[103:17.96]Everything's the same!
[103:20.91]God help me!
[103:22.23]Dermablind!
[103:23.07]Dermablind!
[103:23.85]Blind!
[103:24.29]My computers!
[103:25.39]If I touch a computer, it'll save me?
[103:27.03]Oh my fucking god, I'm just gonna throw everything in the trash.
[103:30.03]I don't fucking even care!
[103:32.33]No, I need that.
[103:33.77]I need my spacesuit backwards.
[103:39.48]Where's the spacesuit?
[103:40.38]Where'd it go?
[103:43.64]Fuck.
[103:44.30]Did George Washington take shortcuts?
[103:48.12]Did... Bill Gates take shortcuts?
[103:53.69]I couldn't think of another person.
[103:57.41]Took me that long to think of another successful person.
[103:59.21]Did Gandhi take a shortcut?
[104:02.92]No.
[104:03.96]They didn't.
[104:10.07]Did Christopher Columbus take a shortcut?
[104:14.09]No.
[104:15.29]He didn't.
[104:16.23]I should've taken the shortcut.
[104:18.13]I should've taken the shortcut.
[104:19.25]Fuck George Washington.
[104:20.29]I should've taken the shortcut.
[104:21.63]Should've taken the shortcut.
[104:24.75]Should've taken the fucking shortcut.
[104:28.30]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[104:31.16]Oh, I had no clip to the door.
[104:32.24]There it is.
[104:32.68]I found it.
[104:33.90]I think I found it.
[104:38.60]Yeah, I think it's this way.
[104:40.18]Where is it?
[104:41.54]Down that way.
[104:42.10]To the left.
[104:43.84]Up to the right.
[104:44.38]I think it's right over here.
[104:48.58]How do I get a better view?
[104:50.54]Oh, I know.
[104:56.01]See, I already lost it.
[104:56.83]It's over.
[104:57.13]I can play the game the same ever again.
[104:59.41]I get a better view.
[105:01.70]The first step is always noclip.
[105:03.26]That's true.
[105:03.66]That's always the first step.
[105:06.78]Yep.
[105:07.14]Let's go.
[105:07.50]Yeah.
[105:07.74]Give him a speech.
[105:40.64]Dynamite joke incoming.
[105:46.33]Oh, you couldn't even interact with it.
[105:49.27]Holy shit, that's wicked loud.
[105:53.78]Look at how loud this is.
[105:57.70]Are you serious?
[105:59.20]Wait, what?
[106:00.62]That's so loud.
[106:04.40]Holy shit.
[106:05.28]Wait, what?
[106:05.96]Put me in the spaceship.
[106:10.12]No, no cheating.
[106:11.57]No, I just, I saw it.
[106:12.87]I just want to see.
[106:13.65]I want to look.
[106:14.05]I just want to take a look.
[106:14.63]I just want to see what's in there.
[106:20.77]This is where it goes off the rails forever.
[106:22.25]This is an odd picture.
[106:25.05]Why is this behind a locked door?
[106:29.52]Some random guy singing to one person in the audience and his clone is sitting in this seat smoking.
[106:35.85]What a secret.
[106:38.83]What a fucking secret, huh?
[106:42.93]Is this right?
[106:43.61]Somebody just put one in.
[106:46.94]I'm gonna believe this guy.
[107:02.09]Spawn this, Jerma!
[107:03.23]Spawn this!
[107:04.11]This'll help you.
[107:04.89]It's always easy peats.
[107:10.33]Oh, this is weird.
[107:13.94]Did I notice that there are f***ing... What's wrong with that easy peat?
[107:22.20]Why did the skin come off?
[107:30.95]This was so funny.
[107:36.51]I'm crying.
[107:38.55]I cry a lot, it seems.
[108:02.79]They turn, like, they get torn through, like, four dimensions.
[108:09.03]Look at his eyes.
[108:10.53]Look at his eyes.
[108:12.02]Fucking eyes.
[108:24.49]Why is this happening?
[108:26.19]Why was this happening?
[108:29.68]I lost all control.
[108:36.02]Oh my god.
[108:39.82]I forgot how heinous this was.
[108:46.35]Why are they exploding?
[108:48.12]I don't know.
[108:54.18]I don't get it.
[108:55.62]I don't get it.
[108:59.29]I don't.
[108:59.63]It's too laggy.
[109:00.83]It's a little too laggy.
[109:03.19]The hurt.
[109:04.09]That hurt.
[109:05.35]That hurt.
[109:07.45]That hurt me just watching it.
[109:13.88]He turned into Zoidberg!
[109:21.78]What am I holding in my hand?
[109:23.20]What was that?
[109:24.74]That's not easy peed!
[109:26.34]That's not easy peed!
[109:28.11]This is not easy peed!
[109:29.41]Oh fuck!
[109:29.67]Oh fuck!
[109:36.61]Who is a flamethrower?
[109:37.67]That's not easy peed either!
[109:39.63]That's not easy peed!
[109:42.34]Oh yeah, he goes naked.
[109:43.30]Oh god, nudity!
[109:44.10]Oh god!
[109:49.05]Nudity!
[109:59.97]A second time!
[110:01.39]And he turns into... Okay, it's almost like... It's almost like this is a weapon... Remember the Bart Simpson game, where you had that thing to show that people were aliens?
[110:13.77]It was like that.
[110:14.51]It was like, I had to hit that guy twice with the show-me-you're-an-alien weapon.
[110:17.96]It's not easy, Pete.
[110:24.72]It's never fucking not funny.
[110:26.70]I swear to God, if this guy turns into, like, a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him, I'm gonna die.
[110:35.65]Oh no, I'm at zero!
[110:38.07]Are we- are we good?
[110:40.67]Oh god, this is- uh oh.
[110:42.91]Have we reached the end?
[110:46.54]We may have reached the end of the- end of the line here.
[111:00.86]I think we're okay.
[111:03.70]I think we're okay.
[111:07.08]I think we were right here?
[111:09.48]Oh god.
[111:09.98]Yeah, we were right here.
[111:10.82]Because I said this thing.
[111:13.71]Ah, no, no, no, no.
[111:14.47]Hold on, hold on.
[111:15.55]Mmm, uh-oh.
[111:17.53]Well, if we go out completely, then they're supposed to fix this tomorrow.
[111:21.59]And I'm going to let them do it.
[111:22.45]I won't be live tomorrow.
[111:23.39]Let's just let them do it.
[111:25.77]And we'll come back again.
[111:27.93]I'm hoping that I don't have to... We're getting a lot of red.
[111:34.39]I'm sincerely hoping that I don't have to spend more than one day trying to get them, because he said that they were going to get on this tomorrow.
[111:40.46]So, hopefully I can go Tuesday.
[111:45.20]Just in case we cut out completely.
[111:51.27]Here we go.
[112:03.50]Okay, that was not easy feet.
[112:04.84]That was not easy feet.
[112:07.66]It's never fucking not funny.
[112:11.51]I swear to God, if this guy turns into like a fucking cheese pizza when I kill him, I'm gonna die.
[112:16.75]They do, don't they?
[112:17.61]I forget.
[112:22.55]Oh, yeah.
[112:23.27]Oh, yes, they do.
[112:27.71]They just turned into a fucking museum statue.
[112:31.71]Look at this.
[112:37.54]Look at this guy's face.
[112:38.44]Look at this guy's face.
[112:39.90]Oh, yeah.
[112:42.80]He's like, oh, fuck.
[112:43.64]I can't believe it.
[112:44.66]He can't fucking believe it.
[112:55.06]This is unreal.
[112:57.68]This shit is fucking unreal.
[112:59.16]It's a time gun.
[113:01.61]I don't have any words.
[113:02.77]There's no words to explain it.
[113:05.12]I'm freezing them in time and ripping their bodies in.
[113:12.63]That's fucking crazy though, really.
[113:15.35]They look like dead space enemies.
[113:24.80]Like gum people, like jello people, like taffy people.
[113:31.94]I made this person in dreams two weeks ago.
[113:35.31]Whoa!
[113:38.91]What?
[113:40.49]I think I found the secret.
[113:43.13]If you turn, uh-oh, I think I might have broke it.
[113:45.60]I don't think it's gonna happen anymore.
[113:55.79]It really never, it's never not funny.
[113:58.75]Come on!
[114:06.61]Kill the other one.
[114:07.63]Kill the other one.
[114:13.30]Fuck.
[114:14.50]Why are you so good?
[114:15.46]Are you seriously this good?
[114:18.24]Fuck you.
[114:20.26]Stop being such a good shot.
[114:23.14]What?
[114:26.57]What the fuck?
[114:29.01]No way.
[114:32.03]No fucking way.
[114:35.13]Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
[114:36.35]Come on, come on, come on.
[114:46.00]Moment of truth.
[114:48.22]You know, typically I would be upset about this, but you earned it, man.
[114:53.16]You earned it.
[114:53.72]Look, now he just wants a drink.
[114:57.17]You earned it, dude.
[114:59.35]You earned your drink.
[115:04.45]Bottoms up.
[115:08.98]I think there's more.
[115:13.90]Sark.
[115:14.14]Oh yeah, Sark came in.
[115:20.37]I remember this.
[115:22.05]A lot of closed casket funerals.
[115:35.65]God, it's... And I'm so happy that, since... That was like one of the first... So that was one of the first real couple weeks of streaming on Twitch.
[115:47.51]And I'm... Like, I still have that much fun.
[115:50.82]Like, I still do that.
[115:52.18]I still have that much fun in-game still.
[115:56.14]And... That makes me happy that I can still have fun.
[116:00.52]Hopefully it's still fun for you too, because...
[116:05.31]I feel like I'm just, I love being able to like, because I don't really watch these.
[116:14.12]I don't.
[116:18.48]I watched like maybe, maybe like a year or two ago.
[116:21.96]I don't really watch old videos anymore.
[116:30.99]Alright, let's do another one.
[116:36.19]We spent seven hours watching you play a DOS text game for seven hours.
[116:39.59]What do you think?
[116:41.20]Well, that makes me happy.
[116:42.04]That's fucking... I'm glad you still enjoy it.
[116:44.82]Alright, let's do another one.
[116:53.10]Let's do... It's always the Monopoly guy.
[116:56.85]That's a good one.
[116:58.39]That's a good one.
[116:59.23]That's a really good one.
[117:01.35]From what I remember.
[117:02.91]Starz Mike, I think, was also fucked during this video as well.
[117:07.61]If I remember correctly.
[117:11.97]So let's get it on here.
[117:24.04]It's always the Monopoly guy.
[117:29.76]Is this game out?
[117:30.70]Did this game ever really get completely bait?
[117:34.91]That was an EZP Jupiter.
[117:36.79]Holy shit.
[117:44.79]Is this game... Should we play this again?
[117:47.29]Is it worth playing again?
[117:50.69]This is the flashback episode in the sitcoms.
[117:54.23]Oh, you know...
[118:04.25]I don't like it, I'm gonna make it bigger.
[118:05.19]Alright, let's do it.
[118:17.62]Fullscreen HD!
[118:21.60]720p, back when 720p was a big deal.
[118:27.03]Back when 720p meant 720p.
[118:29.69]Holy shit, you got a video in HD.
[118:32.85]I remember.
[118:34.78]Alright, here we go.
[118:37.24]No, that needs to be bigger.
[118:38.04]Why is this not?
[118:38.66]Come on.
[118:41.82]Three, two, one.
[118:43.80]Let's go.
[118:47.55]Oh, you know, you could be this guy with the book too.
[118:50.13]This like Monopoly man.
[118:52.07]You're the fucking Monopoly man.
[118:56.21]Oh, Ben.
[118:57.93]Nope, it wasn't me.
[118:59.20]What?
[119:01.84]And here comes the intro.
[119:08.47]I'm pretty good at these things, I think.
[119:10.53]Well, you know, I'm going to know what they are.
[119:12.65]Yeah, I know.
[119:13.61]That's fine.
[119:15.21]I love these N64 graphics.
[119:16.97]I kind of miss them.
[119:20.90]Alright, I'm ready.
[119:25.24]Are you?
[119:27.42]Because you're going to pick the Monopoly guy now.
[119:29.14]I'm going to see the Monopoly guy.
[119:30.84]Why would I be that stupid?
[119:32.74]Oh yeah, let me pick the guy that you would just... Yeah, that's a great idea.
[119:40.24]It's so scary.
[119:41.46]It's so scary because I can see the laser.
[119:45.96]Is it on your head?
[119:47.69]No, I can just see it.
[119:48.73]I can see the laser.
[119:50.19]I know.
[119:50.49]Well, do you see the laser on your head, the Monopoly guy?
[119:53.33]I can see the laser pointing into the room.
[119:55.29]That's all I'm telling you right now.
[120:02.84]Does he get me here?
[120:06.58]I'm so scared.
[120:09.54]No, don't shoot me!
[120:10.60]Don't shoot me!
[120:14.12]Playing the psychology role.
[120:16.24]Oh, yeah.
[120:17.02]Well, I'm gonna get you.
[120:17.84]I think I've already got this figured out.
[120:20.91]You should be scared right now.
[120:22.55]You should be whimpering.
[120:27.17]Fuck!
[120:27.91]These guys are all suspected double agents, okay?
[120:31.21]So that means you're over here somewhere.
[120:35.26]You're in this crowd somewhere.
[120:37.92]Of course I'm in, this whole room is a crowd.
[120:39.95]No, no, no, you're in this crowd like over on the right.
[120:42.61]Because these guys were suspected.
[120:44.97]They were suspected criminals.
[120:47.23]And you're over here, you're one of these four people.
[120:50.95]How could I possibly be one of these four people?
[120:53.05]You're always the guy in the mustard jacket.
[120:54.17]I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.
[120:57.87]I think you're the guy in the mustard yellow jacket.
[120:59.95]Who wears mustard?
[121:01.83]I got my eye on you.
[121:03.50]I got my eye on the mustard jacket.
[121:07.10]Okay, now you said I'm out of here, which means you have to be one of these people, because how would you have known he even walked away?
[121:12.32]Oh.
[121:13.62]Oh, that's right.
[121:14.98]I just figured you out.
[121:16.97]Thinking about that one.
[121:18.03]You're one of the guys in the mustard-colored jacket.
[121:21.97]Okay.
[121:23.75]I don't know which one of them you are, but I know... Oh, you're the lady.
[121:27.33]Alright, gray everybody else out.
[121:28.67]I know which one of these guys you are.
[121:33.90]Yeah, you're that guy.
[121:35.04]You're definitely that guy.
[121:38.20]Say your prayers.
[121:39.06]No!
[121:42.00]You're not good at this.
[121:43.34]He was the lady.
[121:43.90]You were the lady!
[121:45.36]I knew you were one of those guys or you were the lady.
[121:47.71]I had it.
[121:48.59]Did I pick it again?
[121:51.81]You're the fucking Monopoly guy again.
[121:53.77]I picked Monopoly guy again.
[121:56.13]You're just going to play with the Monopoly guy every single time.
[122:01.69]This is a poker game.
[122:02.57]I'm not going to give you any tells.
[122:04.98]Yeah, that's the major tell.
[122:07.04]I don't know.
[122:09.30]It looks like there are.
[122:11.16]I'm taking the shot.
[122:14.78]I was the Monopoly guy.
[122:18.26]Busted jacket.
[122:19.38]You thought it was busted.
[122:25.01]I should have shot the Monopoly guy.
[122:26.87]Yeah, you really should have because it would have been like the Monopoly guy.
[122:31.13]Like it is every single time.
[122:34.27]You seriously better not pick him again.
[122:36.71]It's not gonna work.
[122:37.95]That is why you titled it that.
[122:39.37]Yeah, that's true.
[122:41.67]Hmm... This is tricky.
[122:44.59]I don't want to get it wrong.
[122:45.69]Do I have my suspicions?
[122:55.22]Mustard Jacket.
[122:56.28]I'm standing right next to Mustard Jacket.
[122:58.56]That's a mistake.
[122:59.64]My suspicions are squabbling.
[123:05.37]You don't have very much time.
[123:06.69]I made it real easy.
[123:08.51]You haven't completed your missions, there's no way you have.
[123:16.55]Okay, okay.
[123:18.75]Screw you, Monopoly guy.
[123:20.03]I don't think it's you, but screw you.
[123:21.77]Are you kidding me?
[123:26.00]I was moving so obviously to, yeah, like, I wasn't doing the correct, like, NPC World of Warcraft walk.
[123:33.05]I wasn't doing like the World of Warcraft wolf walk.
[123:36.34]Really?
[123:37.26]Yeah.
[123:40.72]Someone's already in... Oh, that can't be you.
[123:45.02]Because that's the double agent as well.
[123:48.95]You can think whatever you want, bro.
[123:51.53]Wow, he's a wow clicker.
[123:53.51]You want to know what I think?
[123:55.29]What do you think?
[123:56.17]Let's see it.
[123:56.71]I think there's a lot of statues here.
[123:58.69]Yeah, there are a lot of statues here, I guess.

[124:32.25]Who's this lady?
[124:32.87]No, pay attention to the other guy.
[124:33.87]Yes, pay attention to that guy.
[124:35.19]No, no, there's a lady looking at the statue.
[124:36.99]No, that lady didn't do anything.
[124:38.37]That lady's going the other way.
[124:39.73]See?
[124:40.33]You like that?
[124:40.79]That lady's going this way.
[124:42.87]I did, like, the voice.
[124:43.87]Like, it's me.
[124:52.10]Man.
[124:53.00]That guy's just like, I'm just staring at you.
[124:55.42]Why don't you shoot me?
[125:01.24]Does he get this?
[125:01.84]I don't remember.
[125:03.02]Does he get it right?
[125:12.65]No!
[125:15.67]What is about to happen?
[125:17.80]He does.
[125:18.20]Oh, everything is about to happen.

[125:33.85]Hit accept.
[125:35.37]I was stretching.
[125:37.91]The stretch... You gotta go for it sometimes.
[125:48.32]He was looking at me right from the start.
[125:49.56]You gotta go for it.
[125:50.64]He wasn't the wrong idea.
[125:52.18]No.
[125:52.68]I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.
[126:08.41]Are you sure it's not him?
[126:10.67]Look, I'm not... Okay, okay.
[126:15.86]You're picking him this time though.
[126:17.86]I know you can't resist.
[126:19.90]Can we please play a round?
[126:22.22]Yes.
[126:23.90]Where you do not instantly kill the Monopoly man.
[126:30.46]You could just watch my laser.
[126:34.67]That's fine.
[126:35.95]That's perfectly fine.
[126:40.56]Fucking Monopoly man.
[126:42.06]Every time.
[126:44.92]He's gonna take the shot.
[126:46.26]I know he is.
[126:50.33]What's he doing just standing over there?
[126:54.91]He's just standing over there.
[126:56.15]He's not doing anything.
[126:57.65]Too suspicious.
[126:59.11]No.
[127:02.61]Alright, I'm not shooting the Monopoly guy.
[127:08.48]I'm not going to shoot the fucking Monopoly guy.
[127:11.08]You can tell it's 2012.
[127:21.70]I tried to shoot, hold on.
[127:23.14]Yeah, I tried to shoot the Monopoly guy instantly.
[127:27.70]I'm not going to shoot the fucking Monopoly guy instantly.
[127:33.91]I would have had it.
[127:35.23]I would have had it.
[127:43.91]You took like a turn too quickly.
[127:45.96]You had one job.
[127:47.26]It was to kill the Monopoly.
[127:53.74]Oh, did you like that video?
[128:03.75]That was a classic one.
[128:05.37]That was a classic one.
[128:13.27]Reminiscing of yesteryear.
[128:19.24]Watch my curls video.
[128:20.66]No.
[128:21.26]We've already watched that like 50 times.
[128:35.92]Guy room sliders.
[128:39.90]Oh yeah, that is a video, isn't it?
[128:42.83]Extreme body sliders.
[128:45.17]I forgot.
[128:45.65]Yeah, I'll put that one on.
[128:51.18]Let's put that one on.
[129:08.87]three to no three to four four years ago just about four years ago this video was made and then we'll yeah then we'll watch like a couple of uh videos on um maybe like an old star video
[129:36.79]Death to Spies?
[129:37.41]I already did it.
[129:38.47]That was the first one we did.
[129:45.66]Let's get it on.
[129:48.50]So, those of you that ask me to play Skyrim, this is the video, this is the reason why I cannot play it.
[129:55.76]I just can't.
[130:08.29]Hold on, hold on, don't start yet.
[130:09.93]Okay.
[130:27.14]So this is the reason why I cannot play Skyrim.
[130:29.14]Because I did this.
[130:32.76]And away we go!
[130:42.83]My child, the task is at hand.
[130:47.78]You must go undercover to stop the human-dragon conflict.
[130:53.40]Father, I'm not ready.
[130:54.58]Silence.
[130:55.64]You've always been ready.
[130:58.09]You must live among them.
[131:00.27]Be part of the human race.
[131:02.11]Find out what it's like to be human.
[131:04.77]But what if I fail?
[131:06.55]Take the magical cloaking cloak.
[131:08.64]It will always disguise you as a human.
[131:11.08]Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.
[131:14.66]It's extremely strong and powerful.
[131:16.80]As long as you wear this, you're... Oof, that was... We went to zero.
[131:25.58]I paused it, don't worry.
[131:34.21]Alright, let's go back to here.
[131:35.73]Take the magical cloaking cloak.
[131:37.81]It will always disguise you as a human.
[131:40.25]Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell.
[131:43.86]It's extremely strong and powerful.
[131:46.00]As long as you wear this, you are safe.
[131:48.68]Okay.
[131:49.26]I love you, my son.
[131:50.44]I love you too, Dad.
[131:51.38]Be careful.
[131:55.82]First day, just go in, meet a few people...
[132:01.63]Good day, folks!
[132:03.29]A dragon!
[132:04.31]I saw a dragon!
[132:05.83]What?
[132:06.31]Oh, shit!
[132:07.75]Cloak doesn't work!
[132:08.95]Dad!
[132:09.29]A magic cloak?
[132:11.27]Really?
[132:11.61]It was probably just shit-faced!
[132:14.25]Please stop hitting me with the sword!
[132:16.45]Please!
[132:17.47]We can live together in harmony, don't you see?
[132:23.58]Maybe a tad on the large side for a head.
[132:28.06]Longer neck.
[132:30.24]Let me put his head forward a little bit.
[132:31.26]You know, I mean, he's real perceptive.
[132:32.28]He sniffs around a lot.
[132:33.14]He really wants to get to the bottom of stuff.
[132:34.54]He's a private investigator.
[132:36.14]What?
[132:37.26]And I think, uh... I think that's alright.
[132:41.39]I like it.
[132:42.59]Yeah, maybe a little bit bigger.
[132:44.49]Yeah, that's good.
[132:45.75]That's good.
[132:46.35]We're not going to go any more extreme than this.
[132:53.69]It's a dreams character.
[132:56.25]It's a dreams sculpture.
[132:57.99]Excuse me.
[132:58.89]Welcome, child.
[133:00.55]I just was wondering.

[133:09.30]It looks like I seriously took this guy's face and molded it out of clay.
[133:13.18]Good old clay.
[133:13.54]This was an art project that I did.
[133:15.24]I found out that I had to do this art project 15 minutes before it was due.
[133:19.46]And it was to make a person's face.
[133:22.38]I can do better than this.
[133:27.81]jermaPop that's right it's like bullfrog person listening to this guy sitting on a park bench how can you keep a straight face right there how would you not be scared of this the hamburger guy

[134:59.24]I have some bad news, honey.
[135:00.50]Yeah, I had a cold this week.
[135:01.56]I accidentally backed over the cat this morning.
[135:05.28]It's okay.
[135:06.34]He's in high spirits.
[135:07.40]He's still alright.
[135:09.39]You'll make a fine rug, cat.
[135:12.07]I'm just a little cat.
[135:14.57]Please leave me alone.
[135:15.85]You old bitch.
[135:24.78]She goes face first.
[135:25.94]You know, I actually thought I was going to have way more to say about this.
[135:29.70]Is this a cat riding a horse?
[135:32.63]I'll see you next year when this is a Disney Pixar movie.
[135:36.39]Bink!
[135:37.15]Back away.
[135:38.51]You foul humans.
[135:40.21]We have every right to go through this tunnel.
[135:42.55]You can't stop us.
[135:45.11]Well, you never seen a cat riding a horse before?
[135:48.40]Get cultured.
[135:50.94]Oh, shit.
[135:51.92]Fucking Thanksgiving turkey's on the loose.
[135:54.38]That's the best character.
[135:57.20]Hide the women and children.
[136:00.77]The Thanksgiving turkey is the best character I've ever made.
[136:03.40]I'm just gonna run my meat shop.
[136:05.72]I'm doing well for myself.
[136:07.74]I don't have to be concerned that there's an evil Gumby behind me.
[136:12.30]Could be much worse.
[136:14.78]Just don't let him know that you're afraid, and everything will be okay.
[136:21.39]So the... So the Thanksgiving turkey is just the gumball.
[136:26.81]The gum from the Fire Pro Wrestling... This is a Dark Souls game.
[136:32.42]What Dark Souls boss did I make?
[136:35.64]Yeah, shoot that arrow.
[136:36.74]Shoot me right in the penis.
[136:37.98]Good job.
[136:42.99]Hey, Jerva, play Skyrim.
[136:45.79]Play Skyrim.
[136:48.05]I think you should like Skyrim.
[136:55.07]At some point, I kind of can't.
[137:01.43]That'd be such a good stream.
[137:02.65]Yeah.
[137:03.15]That's the thing about like video versus stream, video versus stream.
[137:07.27]So that was like five days worth of just recording stuff and making stuff and coming up with things to put on the camera and record it and edit it.
[137:15.73]It's like we do that still, but it's like in real time over seven to ten hours.
[137:22.42]So it's interesting to see how it plays out like that.
[137:31.81]Who is uglier?
[137:32.73]Saints Row.
[137:35.27]Kung Fu Chroma Key.
[137:41.70]Ask nicely for crits.
[137:43.18]I haven't seen that in a long time either.
[137:51.07]Come on, don't crash on me now, Internet.
[137:55.81]I haven't seen that in a long time.
[137:58.15]In fact, I don't think I've seen that video since it was uploaded.
[138:04.03]Maybe.
[138:05.47]Let's watch it.
[138:16.01]Alright, let's get this off for a second.
[138:21.87]Oh, he's gone.
[138:29.80]Ask nicely for crits.
[138:36.26]This video is long.
[138:37.76]This is like a 12 minute video.
[138:53.39]What even is- what's the- what's the concept in this video?
[138:57.71]Didn't he have to he had to scream right if he didn't scream as loud as he could I wouldn't give it to him Alright, let's get it on Two ads in a row what the fuck YouTube?
[139:21.64]What is this bullshit?
[139:31.24]Alright, this is very much, this is a trip down memory lane for sure.
[139:34.38]This is old Team Fortress 2 content.
[139:38.02]I don't know what is going to be in this video.
[139:39.84]All I know is it exists, and we're going to watch it.
[139:41.52]It's been a while.
[139:45.12]Here we go.
[139:45.78]Ask nicely for crits.
[139:49.90]Alright, we're... Alright, we're going to play hide and seek.
[139:55.37]That's how it starts.
[139:56.81]Let's play hide and seek.
[139:59.95]Hide and seek.
[140:00.63]Come on.
[140:01.03]Let's play hide and seek.
[140:01.85]Two minutes ago, the idea was let's play Team Fortress 2.
[140:05.23]Yeah, but don't you want to play hide and seek with me now?
[140:07.77]No.
[140:08.89]Do not turn around because I don't want you to know where I am.
[140:11.63]Okay.
[140:12.47]Understand?
[140:13.09]Yes.
[140:13.41]Hide and seek.
[140:14.65]The probably dumbest thing you could ever think of.
[140:16.77]We're doing it.
[140:17.33]This isn't like, you know, normally people would just go play prop hunt, but prop hunt's too stupid for you.
[140:23.25]You have to take it to the next level of stupid.
[140:26.10]Okay.
[140:26.28]I'm ready.
[140:27.20]Okay.
[140:29.83]Wait, is this where that comes from?
[140:33.19]Does that come from this video?
[140:35.85]So, context.
[140:37.45]I'll give you context of what just happened there.
[140:39.41]So, there was always like that running joke where like, 3, 2, 1, time to start the video.
[140:55.35]Like, here comes the start of the video.
[140:56.99]Three, two, one.
[140:58.52]Hey, what's going on, Jeremiah?
[140:59.52]What's going on?
[140:59.88]What are you doing over here?
[141:01.20]Oh, nice to see you.
[141:01.76]Oh, I'm just playing around.
[141:02.60]Just hanging out here waiting for you to come over.
[141:04.38]It was the here comes the YouTube start of the video thing.
[141:10.24]We did it all the time.
[141:11.30]We thought it was funny.
[141:12.98]Jeremiah.
[141:13.60]Okay, I'm ready.
[141:15.12]Okay.
[141:15.46]Three, two, one.
[141:16.66]No, no, no.
[141:21.81]Jerma!
[141:22.95]Jerma!
[141:23.51]How's it going, buddy?
[141:24.51]What's going on?
[141:25.01]What are you doing over here?
[141:26.13]Hey, what's up?
[141:26.59]What's going on?
[141:27.49]You know, defending the point, waiting for my buddy Star to come on over.
[141:30.95]Hey, looks like we got some crits.
[141:32.97]You can come with me right now.
[141:35.59]We're going to be using these crits against enemy gamers.
[141:38.16]You tell me when you want me to do it.
[141:41.42]When I want you to do it, you're going to know because I'm going to scream.
[141:46.22]He does, though.
[141:47.80]I'm going to turn this down by you.
[141:53.64]Sorry, I didn't get a lot of people there.
[141:58.64]I thought there'd be more closer than that.
[142:00.83]What the hell was that?
[142:03.05]That was so loud.
[142:06.69]I just snorted it.
[142:07.63]I don't do that usually.
[142:09.49]See, here's the thing.
[142:10.21]Again, he turned his timeline volume down to 5%.
[142:14.31]I didn't get 5%.
[142:15.73]I got 100%.
[142:16.01]So that's...
[142:21.98]I did snort right there.
[142:23.22]That was a pig.
[142:25.04]That was like a little piggy.
[142:26.82]It was like... What the hell was that?
[142:35.26]That was actually a pig snort.
[142:37.74]That's not a typical one that I do.
[142:38.96]I snorted it.
[142:39.74]I don't do that usually.
[142:42.06]You don't do that usually.
[142:42.94]Thanks for clarifying.
[142:44.48]Hey guys, guys, Trevor doesn't do that usually.
[142:47.60]It's still relevant right now.
[142:50.05]It's not a common thing.
[142:51.51]Yeah, don't do it usually.
[142:53.49]Okay.
[142:53.89]I just said it again.
[142:54.65]Please tell me you're gonna scream again.
[142:57.61]Well, how else am I gonna get you to crits me?
[143:01.34]You're gonna have to build it up first.
[143:02.92]Hold on, I'm too, like, busy laughing.
[143:05.24]Alright.
[143:06.92]Alright, so when we build these crits up... We need to take it real careful.
[143:10.94]And his hit sound is me doing something.
[143:14.06]Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, hide, hide.
[143:16.08]Hide, why are we hiding?
[143:17.32]Because there was a guy there that looked like he was going to shoot me.
[143:20.32]I killed him.
[143:21.51]Oh, you did?
[143:21.85]Okay, let's go.
[143:22.17]With the power of Kratos.
[143:24.41]With the power of the golden rocket launcher.
[143:31.44]Pass down from generation to generation.
[143:34.92]What are you going on about?
[143:36.04]Talking about your golden rocket launcher, how it's like a family heirloom.
[143:38.82]I was doing a whole thing there, and you just cut me off.
[143:40.54]No, no, he cut me off.
[143:41.32]What the fuck?
[143:42.46]Yeah, I'm about...
[143:48.42]Watch out for the sentry, I can't- I can't- Alright, you are turning into the judge from Who Framed Roger Rabbit at this point.
[143:55.49]He really was!
[143:57.99]No, the worst part about this whole thing is I heard one of my neighbors coming out of their apartment and they, without question, 100% certainty, they heard me screaming.
[144:07.81]That's fair.
[144:09.95]There's not a single doubt in my mind that they heard that.
[144:12.18]I just don't know what their thought process was.
[144:14.14]Alright, this is also- this is also somebody that shit their pants.
[144:18.07]While I was playing Overwatch with them.
[144:21.63]He shit his- actually shit his pants.
[144:24.49]And I think I was streaming.
[144:26.70]I was either streaming or making a video.
[144:28.38]I forget what it was.
[144:28.92]I was streaming it, right?
[144:31.92]He pooed his pants.
[144:34.54]And sat in it.
[144:35.78]For like a fucking- a long time.
[144:51.11]I still, I can't fucking believe that.
[144:54.73]There's videos about that, yeah.
[144:56.84]This dude shit his pants and he didn't want to like fuck up my stream.
[145:02.18]He didn't want to like run away from the stream, right?
[145:06.82]So he, or with the video or the round, it was something like that.
[145:14.78]Yeah, we didn't even win the game and he was trying really hard to end it so he could just run away after the round was over.
[145:24.98]What a truce, friend.
[145:25.72]Imagine just shitting your pants and you don't care.
[145:28.16]You're gonna play the roundup.
[145:29.80]No, that's not like good friend.
[145:31.36]That's like video game addict.
[145:38.64]That's like ultra gamer.
[145:44.24]That's like video game psycho.
[145:48.34]Dude, they need to start like DXRacer makes those chairs.
[145:50.90]Maybe DXRacer should start making diapers.
[145:54.91]Have like the logo on them.
[146:02.58]Would you shit in a DXRacer diaper if it meant you'd be cool?
[146:10.42]No?
[146:10.64]Alright, let's keep watching.
[146:16.52]like this guy either won the lottery or he's dying that was like that was a happy scream that wasn't like a like a bad oh boy watch out watch out he's so fucking good at this game you know honestly what can you teach me how to shoot people in the air like that like dude I'm telling you people you guys think you guys think that I'm like I don't make it up like I would that's I like I just was saying I have the same reaction

[146:46.90]Like, I wish I could... Hey, you're wicked good at that.
[146:48.88]Can you... It's like I'm reliving the past.
[146:51.16]I'm going back.
[146:52.22]If I went back in the past, I'd be fine.
[146:53.86]There would be no paradox.
[146:54.79]I'd be perfectly fine.
[146:55.61]I could meet myself and we would have the same... We'd say the same fucking thing.
[147:01.65]You know, like, don't ever meet yourself.
[147:03.27]No, I'd be like, what's up, dude?
[147:04.35]Hey, how are you?
[147:04.87]We're going to be fine.
[147:05.79]Because we're going to say the exact same fucking thing.

[147:10.85]Let's go.
[147:11.11]Alright, let's go.
[147:11.69]Let's go to the store.
[147:14.45]And just walk around- wait, no, then the government will find out and one of us will get captured.
[147:17.90]Would we both get captured?
[147:20.74]Or would only one of us get captured?
[147:25.59]They would take us both, right?
[147:26.53]No, they wouldn't get me.
[147:30.85]They'd get him.
[147:33.67]Twins exist.
[147:42.65]If you were twins... Yeah, that's right.
[147:44.57]Twins exist.
[147:46.55]I'm having like a panic attack in the store.
[147:48.69]Oh shit, what if they think we look the same?
[147:52.16]Oh no!
[147:53.66]One of us is gonna get captured by the government.
[147:55.86]Pretend this pipe is him in the air, okay?
[148:00.02]Alright.
[148:01.88]But that's what I do.
[148:02.80]I miss when I do it.
[148:03.74]Hey, I'm just trying to help.
[148:05.76]Alright.

[148:47.86]I'm being very easy.
[148:49.96]Nice.
[148:50.68]Nice job.
[148:51.84]No, this sniper is going to headshot me.
[148:53.02]Alright.

[150:25.55]Why did he slow my voice down for that?
[150:28.69]I was taking my time killing him because I thought that they wouldn't shoot me, but they were shooting at you, the valuable target.
[150:34.25]I'm sitting there just preparing myself for the real scream.
[150:37.91]I'm sitting there clenching like he's going to scream.

[152:01.27]Dude, there's a health kit right over here. 72%.
[152:04.10]I want, but I want this guy to get his Uber up.
[152:05.42]He doesn't keep screaming, right?
[152:07.26]He gives that up a half way through the video, right?
[152:08.78]Maybe it helps to get your Uber up.
[152:09.57]Watch out for that pyro.
[152:10.57]No, it's the same pyro who only walks forward.
[152:12.21]He won't reflect.
[152:12.85]Don't worry.
[152:13.39]Get this health.
[152:14.11]Give me one second.
[152:15.85]Just chill.

[152:38.28]Jerma the Chris!
[152:39.66]Who's that person going to be?
[152:41.12]That person that comes and heals you.

[152:52.85]Hold on.
[152:53.19]I'm going to take notes on this one.
[152:54.63]I didn't even kill the guy.
[152:56.89]He's a gamer.
[152:57.75]You need to heal me.
[152:58.81]He like rocket jump market garden pulls somebody.
[153:03.60]And I'm trying to get an Ubersaw on one hit on one guy.

[153:14.12]Are you dead?
[153:15.58]He got me.
[153:16.06]No, you're bad.
[153:17.52]I was saying spy to you and you were too busy.
[153:19.80]I was fighting the spy.
[153:21.87]You were not fighting the spy.
[153:23.63]Your eyes were forward.
[153:26.17]And you were looking at like some pyro.
[153:29.91]Why does he keep doing that?
[153:31.31]He's dead.
[153:33.75]He's dead.
[153:34.33]What's going on?
[153:36.74]You see this?
[153:39.14]You don't, you don't, you don't see a beam.
[153:40.16]No, I don't see a beam at all.
[153:43.08]No, I don't.
[153:43.56]Can you just re-click on me?
[153:44.90]Like Medic has been broken in this game for like seven years.
[153:48.30]Watch it.
[153:49.22]Come on.
[153:49.54]Come on.
[153:50.02]Watch it.
[153:50.68]Oh lord.
[153:51.92]It's true.
[153:52.40]Hi, I'm peeking, hi.
[153:54.56]What?
[153:54.70]Is this the magic medic amulet thing?
[153:58.60]Is this where I talk about the magic medic amulet that I wanted?
[154:03.83]Is this the same video?
[154:05.07]What video do I describe the magic medic amulet?
[154:08.07]No, okay.
[154:23.02]I'm sorry.
[154:23.60]I'm really sorry, because that was like... We were getting close to winning that.
[154:28.68]Yeah, yeah.
[154:29.46]I mean, we were right up there.
[154:30.52]You're building crits.
[154:32.04]You shouldn't have even mentioned it.
[154:33.96]I shouldn't have, but I... How do you take that hit sound?
[154:37.17]There's a soldier that's behind us.
[154:39.67]I don't know if he's going to rocket jump up here.
[154:40.87]Wouldn't that just get on your nerves?
[154:42.11]He might rocket jump up here.
[154:43.25]No.
[154:47.42]Get that 70%.
[154:48.74]Get that last 30%.
[154:49.58]Let's climb up again.
[154:50.30]Let's climb up again.
[154:50.92]Let's climb up.
[154:51.42]I gotta say everything like four times because you're an infant.
[154:55.16]You could have just said it once and I would have understood.
[154:56.84]You messed up!
[154:58.36]If I would have said it... Uh-oh.
[155:00.52]Uh-oh.
[155:10.59]Not good.
[155:16.05]Not good.
[155:17.97]That was a big one.
[155:25.41]I think the stream turned off for like five straight seconds.
[155:31.59]Okay.
[155:33.71]Again, I'm going to make it really clear again.

[156:09.64]Is that what you wanted?
[156:11.72]Not right that moment.

[156:13.52]Are you joking?
[156:14.61]No, okay, I looked real bad right there.
[156:16.93]Let me just clarify this for a second.
[156:18.81]Yeah, guys, come on.
[156:19.56]He doesn't usually snort.
[156:21.56]Alright.
[156:23.06]What I want to say is that you used it at a time that was not opportune for me, and it's because I didn't scream, and you were unsure if I wanted it that time.
[156:30.26]He doesn't usually snort.
[156:32.14]Alright.
[156:33.09]He's 100% flawless.

[158:12.90]What?
[158:13.14]What?
[158:13.38]What?
[158:14.67]You didn't even know.
[158:15.49]Yes!
[158:16.43]How did you... Well, you made the joke and you got the spy, so that's a win.
[158:20.29]He had plenty of time to stab you.
[158:21.93]It was very scary.
[158:22.93]Okay, let's go.
[158:29.94]Let's go.
[158:30.24]Let's go.
[158:30.52]Let's go.
[158:31.18]Pick up the pace.
[158:31.76]Pick up the pace.
[158:33.22]We want to win this in under one minute.
[158:35.04]This is the speedrun.
[158:36.15]Under one minute?
[158:37.05]Are you sure we're going to be able to do it?
[158:38.03]I think we do it.
[158:38.75]I think we do it.
[158:39.19]Climb up.
[158:40.03]This is the climb strat.
[158:40.81]We're going to keep doing the climb.
[158:43.85]I had trouble getting up.
[158:45.49]I had trouble.
[158:46.73]We got scouts.
[158:47.73]I always had trouble in the source engine jumping.
[158:51.46]Got it.
[158:51.74]I understood.
[158:52.88]I completely understood.
[158:53.82]Jumping and crouching and landing on stuff in the source engine was always hard for me to do.
[158:56.68]Okay, okay.
[158:58.00]It works a lot better when I scream.
[159:00.04]I'm dead.
[159:02.30]No!
[159:03.02]There's just engineers everywhere!
[159:04.37]We got it! We did it!
[159:10.53]We did it!
[159:12.81]Why am I saying these-
[159:15.13]7- no 10. I'm really impressed with the 10 points.
[159:18.41]Ooh 10 is a number, 7 is also a number too.
[159:22.75]End on the screen!
[159:24.47]I'm back here.
[159:24.77]I need to sneeze. I have to sneeze. But sneezing doesn't mean use the kritz.
[159:32.61]You screamed! You screamed! You screamed!
[159:36.59]You told me if there's a scream, use the kritz, and guess what?
[159:39.61]I said I'm gonna sneeze, and the sneeze doesn't mean to pop it.
[159:44.24]I wasn't here, I was out of the room.
[159:47.68]Handball Showdown, the funny part about Handball Showdown is that he didn't want to upload that video.
[159:51.82]He said it was a terrible video.
[160:03.84]I remember we watched it back and he was just saying to himself, well, handball was really a bad game.
[160:12.61]Battle of the Executives.
[160:19.53]Let's see, what do we got for time here?
[160:22.44]Hold on, give me one moment.
[160:23.42]I have to check my phone.
[160:29.74]The frog video?
[160:40.71]The, um, that, the, that amazing kind of frog video, whatever it was.
[160:44.44]Okay, just wanna, because I gotta pick up Kim.
[160:59.43]And that was one of the reasons why I started a little early.
[161:01.85]Unfortunately, I did not know we were going to run into this bullshit, which is the internet stuff, but it's all good.
[161:08.18]So, let's do Battle of the Executives.
[161:10.68]That sounds like a good one.
[161:12.40]I remember that one.
[161:26.20]Also, there's a second one.
[161:27.50]Didn't they come up with two of them?
[161:35.27]There's another one of these that's available, isn't there?
[161:39.50]I think Star wanted to play... I forget what the name of the game was.
[161:44.24]Something like Dwarf?
[161:47.96]Like Left 4 Dead Dwarf game?
[161:49.95]I don't know what it was supposed to be.
[161:51.89]It looked fun though.
[161:57.65]I forget what it was called.
[162:00.95]No, not Vermintide.
[162:01.83]It was something else.
[162:05.85]Deep Rock Galactic, I think that's it, yeah.
[162:08.38]He was talking about playing that.
[162:10.16]And then we really should play the... We really should play the Battle of the Executives 2.
[162:17.66]Sorry, there's an ad.
[162:29.76]Get that game now.
[162:31.42]Well, I mean, I will.
[162:34.34]When me and Star are going to play it.
[162:37.14]Left for Dwarf.
[162:40.51]Alright.
[162:41.79]This is Battle of the Executives.
[162:50.43]Thank you for joining us on impromptu watch old video night.
[162:54.94]Or watch old video day.
[162:58.40]It's fun to look back though, it is.
[163:00.49]Here we go.
[163:09.19]If that scumbag thinks he can take us on, if he thinks he's going to destroy our will and take down our pride, he has no idea what he's dealing with.
[163:17.84]Sergeant Truffletop, you are my leader of the command unit.
[163:21.34]You must take it forward, and you must find him and destroy him.
[163:25.82]Puffleduffle, say hello to the missus for me.
[163:30.04]Of course, who could forget you?
[163:33.44]Bilbo Baggins.
[163:35.41]Copyrighted character that I just said.
[163:36.55]Alright, when you're done with this joke, explain to me if there is anything else we can build.
[163:40.97]Um, besides these drones.
[163:45.81]Forever.
[163:49.65]And you, Anthony Wimbleston, you have been my number one companion ever since we were two.
[163:55.27]Remember we had that birthday cake that time?
[163:56.89]Remember we shared that birthday cake?
[163:59.67]You have to meet me in the middle, like diplomats come forward.
[164:02.95]Alright, so diplomats come forward, I meet you in the middle.
[164:04.81]So stop having them following you.
[164:06.53]They're not close enough.
[164:07.27]Diplomats?
[164:07.85]I don't remember any of this video.
[164:09.09]They're gonna start shooting.
[164:10.89]No, they're not.
[164:11.51]See, alright.
[164:12.59]Stop.
[164:14.73]They're not stopping.
[164:15.59]How do you make them stop?
[164:16.67]Was there a wait?
[164:19.09]There's no wait.
[164:23.69]Technical difficulties.
[164:24.83]Where are you?
[164:25.43]I didn't put that on there with my executive right now.
[164:28.49]I see you walking What an insignificant little like shit you are right now I Zoom out like the normal view and it's like there's an ant coming to get me in this Yeah
[164:54.18]Stop building me hallways.
[164:57.96]It's gonna take me too long to get around this.
[165:00.77]Just get inside of it.
[165:03.87]This is never gonna happen if you keep building sections.
[165:06.75]You fucking dick.
[165:12.51]This is gonna take... You just added like 10 minutes to my trip.
[165:16.95]Let me get in here.
[165:17.83]Alright, there you go.
[165:18.81]Oh my god.
[165:20.19]That's so long.
[165:22.93]Well, okay.
[165:24.87]Alright, here I come.
[165:28.72]This is so funny that you could do this.
[165:31.74]I'm coming to your corporation right now.
[165:35.04]Can you do this in the second game?
[165:39.04]Oh, yes.
[165:39.32]You wanted to see me.
[165:42.43]No, no, no.
[165:42.83]Put the gun down.
[165:43.47]I can't put the gun down.
[165:44.11]Put the gun down.
[165:48.78]You look like a shitty douche smirk on.
[165:51.46]Like, yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.
[165:53.12]Yeah, you think you got me in this?
[165:54.77]What does your screen say?
[165:57.91]CEO neutral login screen.
[166:03.61]Why?
[166:04.71]What did I do?
[166:05.49]I got startled.
[166:07.89]I got scared.
[166:08.43]I thought you were trying to kill me.
[166:10.38]I went back.
[166:11.10]I sat down at the computer.
[166:12.88]But I thought you were using telekinetic powers to try to kill me.
[166:17.38]Your executive is dead.
[166:21.66]What?
[166:22.10]This person's not alive.
[166:23.58]They're just not alive.
[166:26.89]I'm tapped into the link.
[166:28.41]No, you're dead.
[166:29.29]Your guy's not even breathing.
[166:30.37]You're just sitting there as a corpse.
[166:32.91]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[166:34.21]Whoa, why are you in here?
[166:39.35]Your guy's face is so fucked up.
[166:42.16]One of his eyes is open and one of them is closed.
[166:45.64]You are deep in thought right now.
[166:47.48]That thing has taken over.
[166:48.48]You've done that too many times.
[166:50.44]You know what I mean?
[166:51.87]Like, you've done this so many times, you, like, shouldn't be doing this anymore.
[166:56.47]Where the hell did you go?
[167:05.14]Oh, dude, that was rough.
[167:06.14]Oh, wait, no.
[167:07.36]I have to do one more thing before I head out.
[167:09.69]I just got one more thing I need to do.
[167:14.29]No!
[167:15.27]No!
[167:20.31]What is going on?
[167:20.99]This game is fucking so much fun.
[167:22.79]He's beef-brained.
[167:26.71]Don't look over here.
[167:30.15]Whatever you do, for like the next minute, do not look over here.
[167:35.61]Did you just make a unit that is playing an organ of death?
[167:41.05]Nah.
[167:44.24]You can turn around in 10 seconds and, like, notice that there's a monster behind you.
[167:48.68]Really?
[167:49.00]Yeah.
[167:51.12]So you're telling me in 10 seconds I can turn around?
[167:55.10]I would turn now.
[167:56.28]Turn now.
[168:02.24]You can't stop me.
[168:04.32]He thinks she's so big.
[168:05.14]He thinks she's so goddamn strong.
[168:06.76]Do you think he's strong enough to take on the march of the C-3POs?
[168:10.50]I doubt it.
[168:11.06]Oh, shit.
[168:17.91]Oh, we both get them, don't we?
[168:20.41]I think we both get them.
[168:23.97]She's being weird.
[168:26.52]Jack in the Box.
[168:28.66]Yeah, we built some hinges on our warehouse.
[168:33.38]Hey, what are you doing over there?
[168:35.68]Nothing much.
[168:37.10]I'm just coming over here to kill you.
[168:38.58]Yeah, that's fine.
[168:39.06]Just get over right here and stand like right there.
[168:41.35]Right over there?
[168:42.27]Yeah, right.
[168:42.85]Stand over right there.
[168:43.73]Okay, I'm coming.
[168:50.15]What is when?
[168:52.75]What a waste of 500 billion dollars.
[168:55.97]My grandfather told me.
[168:57.91]This is the button.
[168:59.01]My grandfather.
[168:59.99]When you know you've been defeated.
[169:02.59]The final stand.
[169:04.79]Activated.
[169:06.68]Let him come.
[169:11.98]They killed themselves.
[169:19.15]What is this guy?
[169:19.89]You can breach the other person's base with units.
[169:23.17]I didn't.
[169:25.19]I won.
[169:27.55]Well, how did you get out there?
[169:29.34]Help.
[169:30.78]I don't understand how you did this.
[169:32.24]Let me in.
[169:33.78]I'm going to let you in.
[169:34.70]Just be careful.
[169:36.86]How did you get stuck out there?
[169:41.28]He wanted to discuss something.
[169:44.30]Yeah.
[169:45.94]What did you want to discuss?
[169:47.18]We're a military compound not too far away.
[169:50.44]You've been... Yeah.
[169:52.34]You know what?
[169:55.48]Didn't even want to come up with anything.
[169:57.78]What did I do again?
[169:58.58]He gave up halfway through.
[170:02.26]You know what?
[170:03.02]It doesn't matter.
[170:04.24]We were playing for two hours.
[170:05.54]Two fucking hours of this.
[170:06.82]What the hell have we been doing?
[170:11.24]It's true.
[170:14.21]It's true.
[170:14.41]We didn't even play the game.
[170:20.75]We had a tendency to do that, though.
[170:22.81]We would just not do anything for, like, three hours.
[170:26.17]And then be like, you know what?
[170:27.85]That was kind of fun.
[170:28.85]I think that would be a pretty good video.
[170:37.16]Damnation?
[170:39.42]I think, yeah, damnation's a good one to do, too.
[170:45.58]So, we'll do damnation.
[170:48.55]We'll do...
[170:52.95]Damnation, Dying Light.
[170:57.55]And then we'll see where we are from there.
[171:02.79]Let's do Damnation.
[171:14.76]Oh, I remember this one.
[171:16.32]This is the Pop-Tarts thing.
[171:22.29]I remember this one.
[171:25.35]This is actually the video where Star laughed harder than anything he's ever done.
[171:30.51]From what I remember.
[171:33.57]He almost threw up laughing at the stupid motorcycle, I think, right?
[171:39.09]I believe this is that video.
[171:42.89]I've never heard him laugh as hard as he did here since ever.
[171:46.95]No, I've never heard him go harder than this.
[171:50.55]Alright, here we go.
[171:52.35]Let's get it.
[171:52.73]On the screen, why don't we?
[172:04.70]Okay.
[172:05.60]Three, two, one.
[172:08.22]Go for it.
[172:17.39]Extreme content.
[172:20.40]Yeah, on.
[172:21.08]What is extreme content?
[172:22.36]What does that mean?
[172:24.47]It's not blood or gore.
[172:25.85]Usually the blood or gore is a checkbox.
[172:28.03]Watch first scene of this game, which hits everywhere.
[172:32.03]My duty is here, as yours is with your men.
[172:35.51]I asked you a question.
[172:36.59]I don't know.
[172:38.09]I know.
[172:39.35]She told me.
[172:40.13]Rourke!
[172:40.61]Yokikan!
[172:41.97]Yokikan?
[172:43.67]Rourke.
[172:45.77]That's this person's name?
[172:47.15]Yokikan.
[172:48.23]I want to move this way.
[172:50.90]I want to move this way.
[172:54.54]It's more comfortable in this seat.
[172:57.42]Yeah, that's better.
[172:59.24]It's more comfy this way.
[173:02.20]Now I got like a good... I can like sit over here.
[173:04.80]Your chat's over here too.
[173:10.10]So I got chat and I got the video.
[173:21.62]There you go.
[173:24.00]Alright, here we go.
[173:26.82]Nice rat tail.
[173:27.56]Whatever.
[173:29.22]That's this person's name?
[173:30.63]Yokiken.
[173:31.97]That's something that Chun-Li would scream when she shoots a fireball.
[173:35.13]Yokiken!
[173:35.93]Yokiken!
[173:37.63]Holy shit!
[173:46.57]This is so loud.
[173:47.75]This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced.
[173:57.87]I hear that in my dreams.
[174:02.13]Does it seriously have to be this loud?
[174:09.76]I told you he was going to die.
[174:11.06]10 bucks.
[174:14.36]Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too?
[174:16.38]That'd been the best.
[174:17.58]What?
[174:18.00]What an awful shot.
[174:19.58]And you're not shooting him!
[174:20.64]How are you missing that?
[174:21.76]How did you miss those three shots?
[174:23.38]I could do that.
[174:24.48]Shoot him!
[174:25.28]Shoot him!
[174:26.34]He's already gone!
[174:30.31]Star?
[174:31.65]Yes?
[174:32.03]I didn't want to be the first one to say this, but I truly think... I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.
[174:39.41]Oh no!
[174:43.17]Where is he?
[174:44.25]Breakfast is almost served.
[174:46.22]Honey, I have your favorite Pop-Tarts!
[174:49.94]Pop-Tarts!
[174:52.42]This is the one with the... No, you broke it!
[174:55.16]You fucking... Did you see me try and come through it?
[175:00.04]You fucking broke it and you messed up the joke.
[175:04.34]Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast snack here waiting for you.
[175:09.00]It's Pop-Tart!
[175:10.42]Pop-Tart!
[175:13.46]His head hits the top.
[175:15.84]Honey, you know there's Pop-Tarts down here.
[175:19.38]Huh?
[175:20.20]What?
[175:20.65]Pop-Tarts?
[175:24.09]You fucking idiot dick.
[175:25.93]Get in there.
[175:27.43]You know, I've got all these breakfast toaster strudel things here.
[175:32.05]They remind me of... I got it in.
[175:41.72]Off of mode, yeah.
[175:42.99]I remember this shit.
[175:44.43]Don't we drive it, mate?
[175:45.53]I got it in the house.
[175:47.59]I got it in the house.
[175:49.55]Help me.
[175:51.65]I don't know what to do.
[175:53.87]I'm stuck.
[175:57.41]Well, get off of it.
[175:58.31]Get off of it so we can do this joke.
[176:05.64]I kind of can't do it.
[176:06.88]I can't do it.
[176:11.13]Didn't you?
[176:12.27]Yeah, I did.
[176:13.95]Once we start to actually drive it on the road, yeah.
[176:16.48]Alright, I'm gonna get off.
[176:17.52]I almost passed out.
[176:18.44]You got into the second floor?
[176:21.62]Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.
[176:28.81]Yeah, that was so cool.
[176:31.27]This is lagging so bad.
[176:33.03]This is it.
[176:38.70]This game just got so much better.
[176:41.66]You can't do that.
[176:46.96]You cannot drive like that.
[176:49.98]The walls.
[176:51.04]Riding on the walls.
[176:52.10]Look at that.
[176:52.88]That's fucking stupid.
[176:57.66]Listen to him.
[176:59.26]Oh, I don't think...
[177:06.01]No, don't go.
[177:07.15]Don't go.
[177:07.83]I'm dead.
[177:08.27]I'm dead.
[177:09.11]I thought I died.
[177:09.97]I was dead.
[177:10.65]I'm, like, gonna burn a place to throw up right now.
[177:15.87]Why would you be able to do that?
[177:18.35]Ugh.
[177:37.55]Listen to him.
[177:38.27]Yeah, he's fucking going nuts.
[177:40.86]What is extreme content?
[177:42.78]What does that mean?
[177:46.38]This was such a boring game, and then they added this to it.
[177:54.52]Oh, you landed on the roof.
[177:56.42]Watch out for this guy.
[177:57.66]I'm gonna die.
[177:58.90]No!
[177:59.14]What?
[177:59.48]I think he ran me over.
[178:01.59]I'm dead.
[178:02.67]I'm dead.
[178:07.73]Alright, here's your last chance, honey.
[178:10.09]They're nice and piping hot.
[178:11.55]Pop-tarts!
[178:12.69]Please give me the pop-tarts!
[178:14.25]Yes!
[178:15.17]Oh, fuck.
[178:19.39]We got it!
[178:23.21]Wait, mom!
[178:23.95]Mom, I need the pop-tarts!
[178:26.46]Oh, he spawns in the room, right?
[178:28.02]Hmm, I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.
[178:38.29]This is like on all those movies you watch with like, oh, the school bus is just hanging by a thread.
[178:44.06]I'm stuck perfectly.
[178:48.08]Like, I have no traction.
[178:49.42]You cannot move at all?
[178:54.37]No.
[178:56.01]You cannot move this at all.
[178:57.07]Did he just fly off?
[178:58.33]Oh yeah, sure you can't.
[179:04.15]No, no, hitting the jet booster on the back kind of helps.
[179:07.40]Alright, I'm done.
[179:08.76]I'm out of this fucking game.
[179:14.90]Talking for games that you kind of wish that you played more of.
[179:22.09]You kind of wish that you played that way more than you actually did.
[179:29.37]But someone was asking, why are we doing this?
[179:31.27]Why are we doing... Wait, where are you?
[179:32.43]You're over here.
[179:33.67]What camera are we looking at right now?
[179:37.09]Because I have dropped just about 100,000 frames.
[179:42.58]So I couldn't really do anything.
[179:45.04]So we're just hanging out.
[179:46.18]Figured we'd just watch some videos for a few hours.
[179:52.30]It's bad.
[179:53.28]It's bad.
[179:55.04]But let's watch Dying Light.
[180:03.43]I think I actually have to go from here.
[180:06.83]This is fun.
[180:07.35]Yeah, I'm glad we got it.
[180:08.79]I'm glad I didn't just like turn it off.
[180:11.49]I'm glad we got to at least stream for three, four plus hours here.
[180:18.17]So let's watch the dying light video.
[180:19.99]Let me move this.
[180:25.71]We salvaged the stream.
[180:27.25]It was salvaged.
[180:28.16]We can at least hang out.
[180:33.54]Dying Light.
[180:39.20]Is that... I think that's a star.
[180:40.96]It's a star video, right?
[180:42.70]No, we both made one of these.
[180:43.68]Oh, okay.
[180:47.71]So I have one too.
[180:49.11]This is Legend of the Tunnel Troll.
[181:04.45]Are they both good?
[181:05.13]Alright, let me get this on here.
[181:12.96]Legend of the Tunnel Troll!
[181:19.48]That, oh, the tunnel... Here, here's another one of those.
[181:22.40]We try to do something over and over again and it just doesn't work.
[181:27.17]We did that quite often.
[181:28.37]We tried.
[181:29.23]Many times.
[181:30.51]And sometimes you guys are only seeing...
[181:33.58]Like, 20% of the attempts.
[181:35.34]Okay, let's get that out of the way.
[181:51.25]And let's get that back on screen.
[181:55.17]And I'll get back on screen, too.
[181:56.71]Why not?
[181:57.09]Here we go.
[181:57.91]One, two, three!
[182:07.69]So that's what that does.
[182:09.37]Its head came off.
[182:10.47]Yeah.
[182:12.41]Interesting.
[182:12.89]Okay.
[182:13.39]Interesting.
[182:15.47]Sir, you appear to be on fire.
[182:21.44]Just dead.
[182:23.86]What?
[182:24.90]Why?
[182:25.64]I thought I had more health than that.
[182:27.20]You just instant died.
[182:31.92]That fake laugh.
[182:33.00]Funny.
[182:33.72]Funny, funny, funny.
[182:48.54]Skip.
[182:52.34]Skip, skip, skip.
[182:56.17]It's going in my video.
[182:58.91]It's going in my video.
[182:59.97]Yes, it is.
[183:00.97]No, it's not.
[183:02.41]What's your response to what you just did?
[183:05.87]Very quickly.
[183:06.79]I want to hear what's your response.
[183:08.41]I'm bored.
[183:13.90]Here's another funny tidbit for you.
[183:16.90]We used to be recorded saying all kinds of fucking weird shit.
[183:20.02]And it would always be that.
[183:21.54]You would always be like, no, no, no, dude, don't put that in your video.
[183:25.23]And it would be fun sometimes to put it in anyways.
[183:31.35]Like, don't, dude, don't put that in.
[183:32.93]That's not something you should put in the video.
[183:35.31]No, dude, I'm gonna.
[183:36.61]No, don't, don't, don't, dude.
[183:38.41]What about my reputation?
[183:42.17]And sometimes you just put it in.
[183:47.92]Sometimes you just put it in.
[183:51.30]Got my gun.
[183:52.20]Oh, what do you guys got?
[183:55.17]What's going on over here, boys?
[183:56.63]Put your hands up.
[184:00.23]Put your fucking hands up.
[184:01.43]Hands in the air.
[184:03.65]Yeah, you need to... He just fucking ruins that guy.
[184:21.00]I destroyed it.
[184:21.92]That was like... Psycho.
[184:23.95]I wasn't the psycho.
[184:25.09]I didn't do it.
[184:25.85]You threw a fucking axe in his head.
[184:29.79]And he just looks left and right like, what the fuck do I do now?
[184:33.63]Yeah, he was like still alright.
[184:35.48]He had no idea.
[184:37.28]It was just so all over the place and so funny.
[184:40.26]He was just like, oh shit.
[184:42.22]Okay, there's an action in my fucking head.
[184:44.54]What am I doing?
[184:45.24]Do I run away?
[184:46.48]Got real dark real quick.
[184:48.32]Oh no, no, no.
[184:50.72]Can I eat these trees?
[184:51.68]No.
[184:52.12]I don't know.
[184:52.85]I really just don't know anything about where I am right now.
[184:55.48]Who goes there?
[184:57.14]This is the tunnel and I am its trove.
[184:59.76]What do you want?
[185:00.56]No, I just was looking for some food, looking for some supplies.
[185:03.45]I just wanted to find something.
[185:04.91]When I come in, I have food and supplies.
[185:07.19]I have both of those.
[185:08.00]I have a lot of them.
[185:09.08]Is this some kind of trick?
[185:10.77]No, I'm not a troll.
[185:13.01]Alright.
[185:13.69]I believe you.
[185:14.19]Come in.
[185:14.41]Come in.
[185:15.01]Come in.
[185:15.89]What do you got back?
[185:16.61]Do you have any... I got this.
[185:18.85]What happened?
[185:20.67]Just you wait 30 or 40 seconds, something real bad's coming.
[185:24.25]Didn't work.
[185:25.15]You got to do it again.
[185:26.59]Can I eat these trees?
[185:28.05]Maybe I can chew on the bark and get some syrup.
[185:30.06]I really don't know.
[185:30.72]I'm just... What is that?
[185:32.44]Who goes there?
[185:33.80]Who tries to enter the tunnel of the troll?
[185:36.16]Not me.
[185:36.68]I was just looking for some supplies and maybe some food to eat.
[185:39.83]Well, hey, I have supplies and food all back here if you just want to come in the tunnel for a second.
[185:43.93]Some kind of trick?
[185:44.49]No, I'm not a troll.
[185:46.69]Oh, okay.
[185:47.49]I believe you.
[185:49.43]I really hope you have pizza rolls.
[185:53.26]What's this?
[185:53.78]What have you done to me?
[185:54.80]What have you done?
[185:56.16]I just wait like 30 to 40 seconds, microwave.
[185:58.90]What are you talking about?
[185:59.62]What am I waiting 30 or 40 seconds?
[186:05.55]This joke is so bad.
[186:08.29]It is.
[186:08.79]It really is.
[186:09.85]This is worse than the fucking jump-through-the-glass pop-tart joke.
[186:14.41]Oh, callback.
[186:15.41]That was a callback.
[186:16.23]I'm gonna get those troll secrets.
[186:17.85]I'll get those troll secrets.
[186:19.13]They're my secrets.
[186:20.07]Get away from me.
[186:20.79]Get away from me, you psycho.
[186:22.15]I'm a fucking psycho troll.
[186:23.25]I fucking hate trolls.
[186:24.21]Let's get out of here.
[186:30.80]Why can't we not get the fuck off this stupid troll joke?
[186:35.80]I'm dropping out.
[186:36.78]We have to stop this now.
[186:38.34]Stock scream.
[186:42.36]That did sound like a stock scream.
[186:44.10]That was a stock scream.
[186:57.66]I'll get this troll secret!
[186:59.52]They're my secret!
[187:00.44]Get away from me!
[187:01.16]Get away from me, you psycho!
[187:03.20]I fucking hate trolls!
[187:04.32]I can't, man.
[187:05.16]Oh my fucking god.
[187:10.26]Why are you giving me the fuck off this stupid troll joke?
[187:16.23]I'm dropping out.
[187:17.61]We have to stop this now.
[187:22.01]Hey, it's me.
[187:23.29]Made it on top of one of the towers.
[187:27.59]You know we're both jumping off, right?
[187:30.71]Yeah.
[187:31.75]Edit that part out.
[187:32.53]There's a fucking zombie up here.
[187:36.23]Hold on.
[187:36.91]Don't do anything to him.
[187:38.47]How would you have ever made it up here?
[187:40.10]She doesn't even have a arm.
[187:42.32]This zombie is armed.
[187:43.84]One arm climbed up here.
[187:45.18]Are you telling me that's what happened?
[187:47.62]No way.
[187:57.06]Copy!
[187:57.40]That's where this came from.
[187:58.52]That is where this came from.
[187:59.78]That cutscene just healed me.
[188:00.76]Motherfucker.
[188:02.42]Toxic motherfucker with fucking snot in his mouth.
[188:10.27]Turn your light off.
[188:29.51]Oh, look, there's like a door here.
[188:30.85]Oh, whoa, I thought it was real.
[188:35.19]Alright, I want you to go through my time travel machine.
[188:38.50]As you see here, my lovely assistant, head on through and I'll see you in the year 1900.
[188:43.56]Oh, that's not as funny as I thought it was going to be.
[188:56.30]What the fuck?
[188:57.30]What?
[188:58.24]Hey, it's okay.
[188:59.52]Are you alright, sir?
[189:01.28]Hey, you just dropped like 10,000 feet.
[189:04.01]I'm glad you're like okay.
[189:04.85]I forgot that happened.
[189:05.81]Okay, what were we doing earlier?
[189:07.01]Let's go.
[189:07.77]Let's do parkour and jump.
[189:09.01]Oh, what are you doing?
[189:12.57]What does it look like I'm doing right now?
[189:19.72]This was such a fun multiplayer game.
[189:21.44]It really was.
[189:22.02]I'm pushing the boat.
[189:23.10]No, what is he doing?
[189:25.58]What does it look like?
[189:28.28]I don't know what it looks like for you guys.
[189:29.84]I'm just joking.
[189:33.20]I just want to ride the boat.
[189:36.98]That's like... That's like somebody just learned Unity, and this is what they're... They didn't animate anything.
[189:44.20]They just learned how to rig somebody in Unity.
[189:46.61]I got it.
[189:47.09]He got it.
[189:49.47]Got it.
[189:50.01]Got it.
[189:51.85]I got it.
[189:52.25]He got it.
[189:52.61]Alright, my turn.
[189:55.67]How did you even attempt to do that?
[189:57.11]I have no idea how you even tried that.
[189:58.47]There's a place you can stand where it's, like, completely, it's really, really easy to do.
[190:01.61]Alright, what if I, like, start to, if I start to fall and can I grab it, maybe?
[190:05.14]Oh, I remember this.
[190:06.68]No.
[190:07.32]I wouldn't do it that way.
[190:08.64]Going for it.
[190:10.16]Look what I just fucking did.
[190:11.64]You want to talk about, like, falling and grabbing onto something?
[190:15.66]Wow, Trevor's the master of falling and grabbing onto things.
[190:17.53]I'm fucking the man.
[190:22.63]Back to square one.
[190:23.63]Everyone, I want all the actors.
[190:25.13]No, shit.
[190:27.73]No, dude.
[190:28.79]Hey, just wait.
[190:29.63]Just wait like 30 seconds.
[190:30.57]Yeah, guess what?
[190:32.27]They're going to... Come on.
[190:35.43]No.
[190:35.53]Get the fuck out of here.
[190:36.67]Run, run, run, run.
[190:40.43]Oh, my God.
[190:46.71]God damn it.
[191:03.28]We have to watch the other one.
[191:05.78]We're going to watch the other one.
[191:07.20]We're going to watch Star's video.
[191:09.94]Here's the thing.
[191:12.94]Star and I, when we played the same game, some more little YouTuber lore for you, we never made the same video.
[191:21.12]We always made it a point to make completely different videos because we didn't want it to just be, oh, here's the same video from another perspective.
[191:28.92]We wanted to always have completely different videos.
[191:33.16]And it would sometimes cause lighthearted arguments because we would get into these little, oh, that was really good.
[191:45.09]That was a really fun clip.
[191:46.38]Who's getting that one?
[191:48.98]And be like, oh, well, you got the guy with the car flipping and crushing the guy's head.
[191:54.32]Yeah, but I think I should have that one.
[191:56.75]I should have that clip.
[191:57.45]That should be my clip.
[191:59.44]That's where, like, need a clip?
[192:00.66]Need a clip?
[192:02.50]We would talk about who was going to have what in their video.
[192:10.03]And sometimes I remember specifically watching a video of his and there was a clip that I thought was really good and I was like, damn, I really wanted that one.
[192:18.71]And he did the same thing, though.
[192:19.97]He did the same thing.
[192:21.03]He'd watch videos of mine and be like, oh, that was better from my perspective.
[192:25.22]It should have been mine.
[192:27.00]So...
[192:27.99]But it turned out pretty good, because you never watched a video twice from just a different camera angle.
[192:35.31]It was always a different video.
[192:38.23]So case in point, let's watch it right now, and you'll see.
[192:45.17]I think we would share, maybe sometimes, if there was something really, really funny from another perspective.
[192:52.91]Typically, it would be different, though, very different.
[193:02.00]His video is titled, Zombie Jackass.
[193:06.63]Tubers that care.
[193:10.11]Well, I, honestly, I just, I just didn't want, and neither did he, and this is, obviously, I don't want to, you know, throw unnecessary shade at, hold on, it's talking to me in my ear.
[193:32.21]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[193:40.48]It froze on me again.
[193:45.18]But what I was saying is, typically you'd have
[193:49.55]You know, let's say two or three people are recording together, right?
[193:53.88]And then they all upload the same exact footage.
[193:56.72]It's just from a different angle.
[193:58.70]And sometimes it wouldn't even be from a different angle.
[194:00.46]Sometimes it would be a game that was not a separate angle.
[194:03.90]It was just, here's the video three more times.
[194:08.98]we just came to a conclusion together that it was we didn't really want to do that we didn't want to have that kind of scenario play out because then if you've seen star's video then you've already seen my video you've already seen you already seen it what could we add to that to make it so it was different for you and but also to you know backtrack
[194:37.46]Some people were uploading like three or four times a day.
[194:40.70]We didn't do that.
[194:43.59]I uploaded like twice a week.
[194:44.93]Maybe two or three times a week.
[194:48.57]Little tidbit.
[194:50.90]Here we go.
[194:51.28]Three.
[194:52.22]Two.
[194:53.58]One.
[194:57.24]Zero.
[194:59.83]Zero.

[197:28.02]Like, what are you scared of?
[197:29.04]I don't know.
[197:30.78]Oh, he jumped up here.
[197:31.91]Go, go, go.
[197:32.79]Oh, no, he can't get away.
[197:34.37]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[197:42.47]Hey, can we help you?
[197:44.85]Can we find your house or something?
[197:46.43]Do you need help?
[197:47.77]Uh, yeah, I could use a little bit of help.
[197:50.85]He's on the run.
[197:51.67]What?
[198:12.75]Hold on, I didn't see that again.
[198:14.07]Do you need help?
[198:15.50]Uh, yeah, I could use a little bit of help.

[198:24.92]What?
[198:25.82]He's just dead.
[198:26.92]He just hit his face.
[198:29.82]Ugh.
[198:32.06]He just... It looks like he tried to slide under the fence.
[198:37.74]He hit his head and died.
[198:46.12]No, we like cut him up now.
[198:50.29]Who's Kratos?
[198:51.39]Is that my name?
[198:52.61]Did you just call someone on the phone?
[198:59.27]Oh god, I hear that and I don't even care.
[199:06.85]Oh yeah, he edited this to make it look like he fell for like 10 seconds.
[199:12.44]It was like a 5,000 foot drop.
[199:27.72]I don't even know what we were trying to do.
[199:29.06]Good joke.
[199:32.26]Great joke.
[199:33.30]That was a real good joke.
[199:35.27]On your favorite Pop-Tart cereal.
[199:49.18]Why is this the funniest?
[199:52.10]The kick.
[199:53.14]They're like...
[199:55.38]Come on, let's go.
[199:57.08]You think you can take me on?
[199:58.88]You're just a bully.
[200:00.72]Stay in there.
[200:02.09]Oh, another propane tank.
[200:04.77]Stay in here?
[200:05.27]Yeah.
[200:07.21]Why am I staying in here?
[200:11.19]Oh, no.
[200:11.95]Okay.
[200:12.37]Hold on.
[200:14.93]Stay in there for a second.
[200:15.79]We also would trade footage to each other if somebody had something funny.
[200:20.13]Stay in there for a second.
[200:21.11]Alright.
[200:24.74]Jerma, Jerma, I was never in there.
[200:27.24]Yeah, I know, it's embarrassing, it's embarrassing.
[200:31.34]It's embarrassing.
[200:33.72]Oh, no, okay.
[200:36.64]Hold on.
[200:37.47]Stay in there for a second.
[200:42.67]Stay in there for a second.
[200:43.73]Alright.
[200:47.27]Jerma, Jerma, I was never in there.
[200:49.77]No, you were.
[200:51.31]I was standing right next to you the whole time.
[200:55.43]My name's changed.
[200:58.95]I'm dead.
[201:01.23]Are you fucking kidding me?
[201:05.81]Okay, that thing seems to be going well.
[201:11.43]He's knocking, he's coming.
[201:12.95]Here comes my super stealth, patented ninja kick.
[201:18.82]Lag.
[201:20.44]Yes, I'm a badass.
[201:22.04]That actually happens in the game too.
[201:23.52]It's interesting, that character only
[201:31.30]Why?
[201:32.16]Why?
[201:32.76]Why did I do that?
[201:34.08]I sat here and I did that.
[201:36.24]Okay?
[201:36.36]That's what you have to understand.
[201:38.59]Foliage is pretty fucking cool, dude.
[201:48.21]Is it fucking hailing out right now?
[201:53.25]My god.
[201:54.43]Run!
[201:58.82]There's like a bunch of birds first impression first impression of the birds They're pretty cool first impression of the zombies a little bit buttery on the hit there a little bit buttery And a little bit cream cheesy.
[202:09.98]Uh, you know first impression of the zombie cream cheese Somebody's throwing rocks.
[202:21.48]No, it's just it's like hail or something weird.
[202:24.22]Oh
[202:32.02]Alright, we'll do a couple more.
[202:33.92]And then I do have to leave.
[202:37.08]Not because of the internet.
[202:38.08]I mean, it's been a pain in the ass.
[202:39.56]But because I have to get Kim.
[202:44.08]So we'll do the bits and everything.
[202:45.52]We will.
[202:46.66]But this stream was going to be a little shorter than usual.
[202:50.98]Probably about like five-ish hours.
[202:52.60]It could have been potentially longer.
[202:54.39]But you know the internet problem.
[202:57.91]You know.
[202:59.21]So let's do a couple more.
[203:00.17]What else are we going to do here?
[203:04.99]I have to do the definition of the Jerma Joke.
[203:08.17]I mean, we just watched the two of them.
[203:14.44]I guess I'll put it on just because we just watched them both.
[203:20.64]It's an unlisted video, right?
[203:25.18]It's a hidden video.
[203:36.45]Was it ever public?
[203:41.25]Mods linking the good version.
[203:42.97]What do you mean the good version?
[203:49.69]What do you mean the good version?
[203:51.79]Why is there a good version?
[204:00.98]No, I'm not going to watch me watching Star watch Definition of a Jerma Joke.
[204:10.51]No, I'm going to watch me watching me in... This is going to be Ultra Compression.
[204:21.79]Alright, alright, I'll watch it, I'll watch it, alright.
[204:34.93]You're gonna get dual commentary from the both of us.
[204:58.33]Why am I getting the flash player error?
[205:01.13]What the fuck is going on here?
[205:14.54]I don't have Flash anymore.
[205:16.40]It was like a little thing, a little puzzle piece.
[205:24.09]Alright.
[205:25.35]I should have it.
[205:28.61]And here's the thing, a lot of people probably haven't seen this.
[205:31.17]A lot of you probably have not seen this video.
[205:33.79]So I guess we're gonna have to give you some context.
[205:36.87]Context is... Check it out.
[205:41.24]Alright, I'm gonna give my context and he can give his context, okay?
[205:47.73]So, when I play games, and this is even like off-stream or on-stream, doesn't matter, I just kind of say stuff.
[205:57.55]Even when I'm, if the camera's not even on, I just talk.
[206:01.51]I say anything.
[206:02.61]I repeat something over and over again.
[206:04.21]I'll just, like a song, I'll just say a song, I'll say a line, just over and over and over again, just because it's my brain just functioning and working overtime for no reason.
[206:15.74]So,
[206:17.38]It's just like a stream of consciousness.
[206:18.68]Yeah, it just flows out of my brain and I just do it.
[206:22.11]So when we record these videos, like you've been told before, we edit a lot of shit.
[206:28.05]And you cut out all the times when you're like, I believe I can fly.
[206:35.84]I believe I can touch the sky.
[206:38.38]And you do it like a hundred times.
[206:39.44]You're just like, ah, that's not, I'm going to get rid of that because why would anybody want to hear me do that a hundred times, right?
[206:52.37]many of you guys may not have seen the definition of a Jerma joke I wanted to watch this earlier and I forgot about it oh stars chat this was a one of the secret videos apart with the zombie jackass you can see zombie jackass 666 dude zombies amount of views uh the secret video 45 000 views I wish I had made this public this as this is one of my favorite videos I've ever made of me in Jerma
[207:18.58]And it is so insanely bad.
[207:22.30]It is so stupid.
[207:24.02]But this is Jerma in a 1 minute 37 second nutshell.
[207:27.38]This is like who he is as a person.
[207:36.47]Got it.
[207:38.21]What's in the crate?
[207:40.51]What am I?
[207:41.63]Oh, dude, there's a fucking knife.
[207:44.41]This caught me cheating.
[207:47.74]Hold on, hold on.
[207:48.68]I have to, he, I'm, this is what I'm saying, like, we're compressing it, like, four times.
[207:52.20]I gotta turn this all the way up.
[207:55.36]I'm not sure I can even turn this up.
[208:03.72]Mm-mm.
[208:04.18]Woof!
[208:06.18]That's loud, but I, that's, I don't think I can turn this up anymore.
[208:10.31]Alright, here we go.
[208:11.85]This is, I tried.
[208:13.11]Stupid.
[208:13.83]But this is Jerma.
[208:15.07]This is, like, who he is as a person.
[208:24.16]got it what's in the crate what am I gonna get oh dude there's a knife there's coffee cheese it's chicken coffee chicken cheese it's chicken coffee cheetos chicken coffee cheetos chicken coffee cheetos and he's like triggering me to do it

[208:54.66]Oh, coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[208:57.24]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[209:00.14]Listen, he's like enabling me.
[209:01.62]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[209:03.36]Oh, coffee.
[209:06.33]Cheetos.
[209:07.59]I didn't even realize this.
[209:10.94]Holy shit.
[209:12.10]Wow.
[209:13.06]I didn't even pick this up.
[209:13.98]It's been years.
[209:15.50]He is enabling me to do this shit.
[209:18.64]He's like triggering me to like do it.
[209:20.90]He's like keeping me enabled.
[209:23.36]Listen.

[209:48.24]And what do you offer in return?
[209:51.59]Cheetos, chicken, coffee.
[209:54.77]Perhaps I shall take both.
[209:57.65]Perhaps I will take both.
[210:00.46]I guess I'll take both.
[210:01.88]Might be getting some Cheetos.
[210:02.92]Might be getting some coffee.
[210:04.22]Chicken, Cheetos, coffee, coffee.
[210:09.64]Fucking coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[210:11.88]Oh, really?
[210:12.75]Because guess what's in here?
[210:14.57]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[210:18.15]There actually was coffee in there.
[210:19.55]I know.
[210:22.78]I laugh every time I watch this.
[210:29.57]It is so bad.
[210:31.29]I'm sitting here like I didn't mute my mic.
[210:32.97]I'm like trying not to laugh to like not go over the video.
[210:36.51]I want you to public it right now.
[210:39.45]Did he public it though?
[210:40.50]I don't even know if that works.
[210:41.52]This is from January 30th, 2015.
[210:46.29]What's going to happen next?
[210:47.96]That's a great description.
[210:49.54]What's the next part?
[210:51.46]Is he going to keep doing it?
[210:54.50]God.
[210:56.98]Listen.
[211:00.98]Don't tell Jerm, I've ever said anything nice about him.
[211:04.87]But he is so good at making absolutely nothing funny sometimes that for a while it was actually discouraging me from making videos.
[211:17.15]That's like at least that style of video like I like my basically serious because I feel like that's what I'm good at He could just you just go ahead and fucking make coffee cheetos and chicken funny for no fucking reason Well, hey hold on star before you let me let me interrupt you there His videos are some of the funniest fucking things I've ever watched Some some of those edited videos
[211:47.70]are like 11 out of 10 so friendship isn't friendship just wonderful no I think that you know whatever I'll say it I think that I think that star had some of the best videos on youtube you know I still think he does
[212:15.73]I uploaded two!
[212:16.43]I thought I uploaded some alright ones over the years.
[212:22.55]Isn't that right?
[212:23.73]Isn't that right, Star?
[212:25.05]I got the shirt on to prove it.
[212:27.23]No, but for real.
[212:30.10]I will forever cherish how much fun this all was.
[212:37.98]I'd be 90 fucking years old just watching Family Feud in a bed.
[212:43.86]And then somebody will say the word like Cheetos and I'll be like, I remember that one.
[212:50.62]That slayed.
[212:51.56]It's true.
[212:55.64]That's fucking amazing.
[212:58.10]But yeah, that's me being fucking strange and I just say words.
[213:06.87]We will do... Oh, mood.
[213:10.15]Mood.
[213:10.59]Oh yeah, mood.
[213:22.68]What's the, uh, because we're reaching over here about, we'll be at about five hours after the bits, probably.
[213:31.77]Public that video?
[213:32.79]I, that's his video.
[213:33.95]I don't have, uh, I don't have control over his channel.
[213:42.79]Intervention.
[213:49.42]Bargain bin beach party.
[213:52.06]Bloody trap land.
[213:56.18]You mad, bro?
[213:57.52]What's this?
[213:58.04]Why are you doing the you mad, bro thing?
[214:06.77]Oh, yeah, we did intervention.
[214:07.97]We did tactical intervention already.
[214:14.05]Zombie pianists.
[214:22.39]Yeah, Zombie Penis is a good one.
[214:25.59]Battle of the Toys.
[214:26.59]That's also a good one, too.
[214:29.11]Battle of the Bots.
[214:30.30]Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[214:32.56]That's another good one.
[214:41.28]Alright, alright.
[214:42.50]Here's what we're going to do.
[214:43.63]We'll do Battle of the Brainless Bots, and then I'm going to have to get out of here.
[214:49.74]And I'm not going to be live for at least tomorrow.
[214:54.16]I'm going to try to come back on Tuesday.
[214:56.15]But I desperately need to get this fixed.
[214:59.65]I'm going to do whatever it takes over the next 48 hours to make sure it works.
[215:03.79]Because 100,000 dropped frames is just unacceptable.
[215:08.37]It's unacceptable, it is.
[215:17.42]Alright, let's get this on screen.
[215:27.90]Do whatever, anything.
[215:30.34]Okay, this is Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[215:31.92]This is a TF2 video.
[215:32.96]Might as well go out on a TF2 video, right?
[215:46.31]There we go.
[215:52.67]Battle of the Brainless Bots.
[215:57.65]Is this when I pretend to go back in time to Hydro?
[215:59.79]No, that's another video.
[216:00.63]Alright, here we go.
[216:04.85]Battle of the brainless bots.
[216:06.93]End on JermaIsMad?
[216:07.91]I think we've already watched JermaIsMad at least once on this stream before.
[216:12.37]Oh, whoops.
[216:14.05]Go back in here.
[216:15.15]No, go in full screen.
[216:16.91]Hey, what are you doing?
[216:19.67]Oh, what the hell are you doing?
[216:25.53]No, it frashed.
[216:27.45]It frashed?
[216:28.17]It froze and crashed.
[216:29.34]I guess that's a new word.
[216:30.48]I mean, if you guys like this, if you guys think this is cool, we can do this again.
[216:43.88]The only reason why we started to do this in the first place is because of the internet.
[216:48.73]That's the only reason why we did it.
[216:50.63]But if people like this and people think it's fun to...
[217:02.84]Why do I keep doing this?
[217:04.86]I think my actual browser keeps crashing.
[217:09.22]Pain in the ass, come on.
[217:12.18]It brings in the bucks!
[217:14.78]Nah, it's just fun to... I would only want to do this if it was, um... Like, I hadn't seen them in a while.
[217:22.21]I want to watch ones that I haven't seen because it's almost like I forget some of the shit that's in these videos.
[217:27.80]A lot of these things I forget, actually.
[217:30.08]It's been so long, and I've put together, I've seen so many clips, and I've seen so many timelines, right, that it's almost hard to remember.
[217:38.17]Alright, can I please fucking interact with this?
[217:45.15]Finally!
[217:45.59]Jesus!
[217:46.87]Alright.
[217:47.81]Took long enough.
[217:49.69]Alright, here we go.
[217:50.83]Battle of the brainless bots.
[217:56.35]Three, two, one.
[218:02.31]Jerma, I'm already just so exhausted from even trying to put this together.
[218:11.19]There hasn't been an ounce of enthusiasm in my voice since we started talking about this, but now we're ready.
[218:15.53]I sent you the info.
[218:16.23]Let's do this.
[218:18.21]You, like, do not want to do this at all.
[218:22.32]That, like, makes it... I almost, like, threw up.
[218:24.18]Did you hear that?
[218:24.76]A little bit, yeah.
[218:27.01]So here's what the deal is, right?
[218:29.41]So here's Star, he's the soldier right here.
[218:32.07]He's on red team, I'm on blue team, this is upward.
[218:34.87]We are going to both have a team of easy mode bots.
[218:38.99]That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty they could possibly be at.
[218:43.20]And why is there a tank?
[218:45.36]This feels familiar.
[218:46.28]Easy, easy mode.
[218:51.33]No, no, don't break your own fucking server.
[218:56.09]They kept training into him.
[218:58.89]Can you give me one second to explain what's happening?
[219:05.01]Yes.
[219:06.67]Look at this mess.
[219:08.23]I can't believe you made a trail to yourself.
[219:13.95]Okay, even in death.
[219:15.77]It's GTA.
[219:16.29]Yeah.
[219:16.71]Even in death.
[219:17.11]I really didn't think you were ever gonna be able to do this.
[219:21.05]You brought the truck punchline over into Team Fortress 2 and your servers are gonna crash.
[219:28.42]There's no way we're making out of this one.
[219:31.00]This place is shutting down.
[219:34.12]Shit's like flying by my screen.
[219:37.16]Oh no.
[219:38.04]We invested our money poorly.
[219:40.15]We didn't put it into a 401k.
[219:42.51]It's disappearing!
[219:45.03]All of our money is disappearing you quick somebody make a Jerma and Bitcoin joke quick You wanted to invest in a lollipop company.
[219:52.39]It's all gone.
[219:53.49]Alright, come on out There they are not leaving.
[219:59.05]Oh, yeah that there were one person is it seems two of them has left
[220:04.09]They're a little bit delayed.
[220:05.21]They're out here.
[220:05.82]They're making some progress.
[220:06.88]Don't worry.
[220:07.32]We have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout not moving.
[220:12.66]They're actually pretty smart for being easy bots.
[220:15.32]I think my guys are pushing in.
[220:16.84]We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control point here.
[220:20.19]Pyro coming out here.
[220:21.01]Looks like... Do you see your spy?
[220:23.69]No, I'm watching the action.
[220:25.03]He was just standing still.
[220:26.75]There is no action.
[220:28.25]Robert Heavy is not doing anything.
[220:29.51]What are they doing?
[220:31.99]What is he still doing?
[220:33.32]He's out of bullets, I think.
[220:38.90]Okay, I'm gonna pay attention to something else.
[220:41.38]Why are they doing a melee fight?
[220:44.62]Are you kidding me right now?
[220:48.24]What the fuck?
[220:50.32]Did you seriously make every single person a spy?
[220:52.84]Yes.
[220:54.03]Oh my god.
[220:55.83]What are they doing?
[220:56.69]I don't- What is your team doing?
[220:59.45]What are- Why are they freaking out in the corner over here?
[221:03.33]That's just what spies do.
[221:05.41]This is what you should be aiming for.
[221:07.13]Oh, make sure you're disguised.
[221:09.87]Yeah, they keep, like, jumping and jumping.
[221:11.43]I just heard, like, Ten seconds.
[221:16.41]I wonder if- I think they all- Why are they trying to jump through the boards?
[221:20.42]That doesn't work like that.
[221:21.50]You're not, like, made out of taffy.
[221:24.32]Here we go.
[221:26.42]Um.
[221:27.10]Here they come.
[221:31.13]They're just all disguised as the same person.
[221:34.69]Don't even tell me.
[221:35.43]Please don't tell me they're all going to keep coming out of this door.
[221:38.73]Where else would they go?
[221:39.77]I don't know.
[221:40.46]There's only one option.
[221:41.94]I go out this door.
[221:44.37]all your spies I think you like broke them hold on let me see where they are I forget when they're done no they're all going out the front door now they're all coming out the front door that spy is an enemy okay this this is stupid nobody's even attacking stupid is now they're going after each other
[222:13.27]No one's even gonna go for the point this is gonna last exactly three minutes and 32 seconds Because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches are gonna go for that point Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold I
[222:34.93]We actually capped it.
[222:36.37]Really?
[222:36.53]How the hell did that happen?
[222:37.85]I don't know.
[222:38.27]Maybe it had something to do with the tank.
[222:42.13]What?
[222:42.51]They just crushed that guy.
[222:44.91]It just starts running people over.
[222:47.72]They're all going to get stuck on it.
[222:50.00]They're all just shooting it like, what the hell is this blocking the door?
[222:53.72]Yeah, this guy's freaking out.
[222:54.98]I'm about to get trick stabbed.
[222:56.16]No, no, no.
[222:57.50]Is it actually making its way in?
[222:59.41]No, it's not, is it?
[223:01.22]Please crush them.
[223:01.80]Please crush them.
[223:03.58]You go like crushing them.
[223:05.97]The text.
[223:06.39]Oh my god.
[223:08.73]No it didn't kill them.
[223:09.79]They got in.
[223:10.97]It's fine right here.
[223:13.69]He's just getting fucking run over.
[223:15.61]He's trying to like shoot it with a shotgun.
[223:31.34]They're gonna... I'm gonna die!
[223:34.60]They should know how to be at it.
[223:39.41]They're actually doing enough damage to it.
[223:44.15]There's some engineers on the back of the tanks.
[223:46.81]Yes.
[223:49.73]I'm gonna kill him!
[223:52.01]Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber.
[223:54.19]Elders react.
[223:56.19]Dude, they just keep getting run over.
[224:00.16]Oh...
[224:04.02]Alright, redo.
[224:07.12]Retake.
[224:08.28]Redo.
[224:08.74]I need like a second before I throw up.
[224:12.70]Why are they all taunting?
[224:16.87]They don't even know to shoot yet.
[224:18.31]Why are they not shooting you?
[224:20.85]Because the round hasn't started.
[224:22.31]I'm not supposed to be out here.
[224:24.39]They're that confused about the round not being started yet.
[224:27.35]That they refuse to shoot you.
[224:30.92]What are they...
[224:32.69]This doesn't make any... Wait, hold on.
[224:33.84]I want to see what happens in one second.
[224:35.16]Stop!
[224:40.52]How is anybody on blue team gonna get anything done?
[224:44.52]You have such a huge advantage because you're allowed to build your sentries first.
[224:49.12]My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.
[224:52.91]Hey.
[224:53.96]You could be a little bit more respectful.
[224:56.86]Just wait.
[224:57.38]Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.
[225:00.12]I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.
[225:04.65]Eaten alive by what?
[225:06.01]We barely have a defense.
[225:07.73]The sentry mosquitoes.
[225:10.51]Why do you need a catchphrase for everything?
[225:12.81]Here we go, let's see what happens.
[225:14.49]That's better than anything else is going to work.
[225:16.75]Why do you have to have a catchphrase for everything?
[225:19.89]Let's start getting these teleporters out.
[225:23.03]They're so confused.
[225:23.80]They're prioritizing the teleporters over centuries.
[225:26.48]Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than centuries.
[225:30.24]No, seriously, this was done.
[225:33.06]The joke was over.
[225:34.42]That joke ended so long ago.
[225:42.10]Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?
[225:51.05]Good times.
[225:52.23]Good times, man.
[225:53.39]Good times, man.
[225:54.51]I'm just in the corner over here hanging out.
[225:57.03]Good times.
[226:02.21]Alright, guys.
[226:04.29]I have to end the stream.
[226:16.60]Back when I was in my prime I was so I saw handsome I do apologize again for the Extreme internet problems but I'm Gonna try to get him fixed.
[226:40.45]That's all I can do.
[226:41.29]I'm just gonna try to
[226:44.32]Hopefully we can come back strong here without any problems at all on Tuesday.
[226:48.82]If for some reason it's still really bad on Tuesday and I can get it fixed on Tuesday, I'll let you know.
[226:57.74]At this point, I don't know.
[227:00.26]I'm shooting for Tuesday.
[227:02.86]So just keep an eye on the sus over the next 24 hours and we'll find out.
[227:09.53]But yeah, this was fucking fun.
[227:14.97]It makes me happy.
[227:18.81]That we can kind of just go back and watch some of those old videos.
[227:21.73]That's... You guys are fucking awesome.
[227:26.44]It's been a long time.
[227:27.68]It's been fucking almost ten goddamn years.
[227:30.86]Holy shit.
[227:33.83]But let us say goodnight for now.
[227:38.05]See you again possibly on Tuesday.
[227:39.53]I will keep you updated.
[227:41.70]I will probably make a tweet about it just to make sure everyone knows what's going on.
[227:47.00]Thanks for watching as always.
[227:53.42]At least we salvaged it, right?
[228:01.00]So let's go to the bits.
[228:03.58]From earlier today.
[228:09.62]See you soon.
[228:10.64]Take care.
[228:14.42]And if you thought that was fun, I mean, we can do it again.
[228:15.88]I just, I don't really do a whole lot of kind of react or watch kind of videos on streams type of stuff.
[228:24.62]But every once in a while, it's fine.
[228:26.10]You know, do that like once every couple months or something, once a month.
[228:31.41]We'll see.
[228:31.69]That was fun.
[228:33.62]So let's head back to four or five hours ago here.
[228:37.18]We had... We had a lot of community subs.
[228:40.70]We had a bunch from... We had five from Kazzy.
[228:43.32]We had five from SoupStore.
[228:46.75]Thank you for those.
[228:47.67]We had three dollars for... From thanks for the FAMAS.
[228:53.81]Thanks for the three bucks.
[228:58.10]I've been watching you for so many years, it needs to do with retrospective.
[229:00.74]Yeah, it is.
[229:01.70]That's the first time I've watched those videos since at least a few years, so... It's cool.
[229:07.24]But thank you for the $3.
[229:08.66]First time I've ever seen a stream, thanks for being... Thanks to being British, but thank you for helping me through a lot in the past few years.
[229:15.68]Much love.
[229:17.42]Thanks to being British.
[229:18.30]British.
[229:20.14]British.
[229:32.23]Oh, the time zone, right.
[229:34.37]The time zone.
[229:35.47]I was like, wait, what?
[229:36.11]I was like, I'm British?
[229:38.47]Am I?
[229:40.29]Multi-trip thanks to the three dollars.
[229:41.59]Have some money to make you feel better.
[229:43.09]No, I can't let it get to me anymore.
[229:46.51]You know, I can't.
[229:47.21]Like, it's gonna happen.
[229:49.73]I'd rather just relax and just deal with it, right?
[229:53.87]What's gonna happen if I get fucking angry and furious?
[229:57.07]No, I can't believe this shit!
[229:59.57]It's not gonna do anything, so...
[230:03.33]Just make what you can with what you got, right?
[230:06.19]That's what you can do.
[230:07.01]I'm not gonna let it bother me.
[230:12.68]And it turned out to be a fun stream anyway, so that's fine.
[230:16.10]Um... Sam and Max, though, that's a... We gotta figure out where I'm gonna put that.
[230:21.48]Because I want to do Garden Flipper DLC.
[230:24.81]When I... The first stream when I come back is probably... Ugh...
[230:31.79]We'll probably have to make... I don't know.
[230:33.91]It's going to be hard.
[230:35.01]I'll put it somewhere next week.
[230:38.63]So we're going to do Garden Flipper when we come back.
[230:40.70]And then I want to play those episodes in Sam & Max.
[230:44.20]We just kind of get screwed over today.
[230:51.22]We'll figure it out.
[230:52.80]We'll figure it out, don't worry.
[230:55.53]But thank you to some guy for the 15 bucks.
[230:57.96]Thank you, some guy.
[230:59.52]I got screwed by the last course of this semester last Friday pretty hard.
[231:03.14]I probably failed it as well.
[231:04.84]At least you put a smile on my face due to the fact that you are screwed even harder by Cox.
[231:15.95]But thank you for the $15.
[231:18.79]I'm not sure what course it was or what classes or
[231:25.39]You know, fuck them with you.
[231:26.55]But, all you can do is, you know, if you have, you know, some bad grades or bad GPA or something happened, you just gotta keep doing it.
[231:36.52]Keep, try.
[231:37.86]You know?
[231:39.98]Do what you can.
[231:52.34]I had a 4.0 semester.
[231:54.17]Well, aren't you Mr. Smart?
[231:59.49]I had a couple of spots in college where I didn't do very well.
[232:04.28]I was just borderline above... What's it called?
[232:11.30]Probation, right?
[232:13.23]Academic probation.
[232:14.51]I was like maybe...
[232:16.60]I was like, I was probably two or three tests away, or one letter grade away from being on academic probation.
[232:23.97]But then I... I kind of got myself situated.
[232:29.05]I started to do better.
[232:30.15]I had like a 3.0, I think, total, or like a 2.9, or like a 3.1 or something, whatever it was.
[232:38.25]But all you can do is just keep going.
[232:41.15]There's no secret formula, right?
[232:49.71]But yeah, I've had my fair share of troubles in school.
[232:58.25]But thank you for the $15.
[232:59.39]Wish you luck.
[233:01.68]Hopefully you can figure it out.
[233:03.86]Thank you.
[233:05.96]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $2.50.
[233:07.50]This was one of your best moments.
[233:09.56]This was one of the best moments.
[233:12.60]Oh, this is the...
[233:30.47]That's true, that's true.
[233:32.55]Everyone will be quiet and say, what is he doing?
[233:34.41]Because you're the teacher.
[233:35.05]You're not supposed to do that.
[233:36.99]The teacher's not supposed to make the weird noises.
[233:39.27]The kids are.
[233:40.19]So it's just like, why did he just do that?
[233:42.77]Silence.
[233:44.37]Okay, so now that I have your attention...
[233:50.17]But thank you for the $2.50 and that like shitty mic.
[233:55.43]That mic was so bad.
[233:57.51]That was the pre-move mic.
[234:00.89]Thank you, Frost, for the $5.
[234:03.39]I hope chat doesn't bother you too much when internet stuff is happening.
[234:06.40]I watch no matter what because you are quite a comedic talent.
[234:09.98]Thanks for the $5, Frost Tro.
[234:13.99]No, chat doesn't bother me when that happens.
[234:17.73]It bothers me that I want the stream to be fun and watchable and I don't want it to buffer and cut out on people and when it happens, I get frustrated at that.
[234:29.98]Because I want the stream to be good.
[234:31.68]I want the stream to be... I can pay attention and we can go through something and you don't have to worry about some other force negatively affecting your stream.
[234:45.26]So, no, chat messing around, no, that's not the issue.
[234:50.66]The issue is I want the stream to be watchable.
[234:53.89]And if it isn't, then I have a problem, because that's what I'm doing here.
[234:59.21]But, I expect it to be fixed in the next couple of days.
[235:02.75]I do.
[235:03.09]I really do.
[235:05.48]I have somebody, I have a supervisor at Cox that every time there's a problem like this, it takes like a week or two, but they get it done, they fix it, it's over, and it's good for like three months.
[235:16.55]So, I'm confident that they will get it done.
[235:18.81]I am.
[235:26.72]At least I hope so.
[235:27.52]Otherwise, that would be bad.
[235:30.22]But thank you, Frost.
[235:33.66]Thank you, Mr. Atigan, for the $6 here.
[235:35.64]That's true.
[235:46.35]That was unbelievable.
[235:47.35]I mean, that may have been the strangest thing I've ever captured in front of my face.
[236:00.11]And then they say, go box Etalyx.
[236:02.25]Why would I do that?
[236:04.39]That's not, what, no.
[236:05.19]No.
[236:10.69]Thank you, Heldrich, for the five dollars.
[236:12.51]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching for years.
[236:15.04]Thank you for that.
[236:16.20]I'm so happy to see how much success you've had.
[236:18.50]You're an inspiration, my dude.
[236:20.16]Keep up the good work.
[236:20.86]P.S.
[236:21.66]Alter ego male had me crying laughing.
[236:26.04]I'm glad it did.
[236:29.04]Because it was fucking crazy.
[236:31.12]But thank you so much.
[236:32.56]Glad to have you for that long.
[236:37.00]Thank you so much for the five dollars as well.
[236:43.01]Mentosium, thanks for the 250.
[236:44.45]Any updates on Movie Night 2?
[236:50.75]No, I don't really have an update for you.
[236:54.33]There's a lot of things that I'm trying to do at the same time and that kind of fell backwards behind a couple of the other things that I am putting higher on the priority list.
[237:10.26]So there are other things that have taken priority from that second movie night to, like, set it up.
[237:22.72]Play Monster Rancher DS.
[237:26.68]Yeah, I gotta figure out how to cap DS, because there's a lot of games on DS, too, to play and mess around with.
[237:36.07]Dermal lied about Movie Night 2.
[237:37.49]Here it comes.
[237:37.99]Make another one.
[237:38.59]Make another... No, we'll eventually... We'll probably... I think we'll eventually do it.
[237:45.86]That was the most viewed stream ever.
[237:50.74]Yeah, I know, but...
[237:53.85]It's important to me that even if something, like let's say something really works, and it's really, like for instance like that, and like the Jerma Rumbles, there's a lot, like there was probably eight, nine thousand people watching the last Jerma Rumble.
[238:06.82]Just because an audience is there that's large, I want to make sure that it's done right, and I don't want to just keep doing it just to do it, because I know that people will come and watch it.
[238:17.44]I want to make sure that it's fun, and that it's worth doing, and that people will think it's fun, and it's not just something that I'm pumping out on a... just to get it out there, right?
[238:27.43]That's my philosophy for a lot of things.
[238:31.71]Jeremy lied about picking up Kim.
[238:35.14]So maybe it would be easy just to throw together that movie night, but I... It's almost like I want it to be... the way that I want it to be.
[238:45.44]It's weird to talk about.
[238:51.19]When are you going to stream with Joel?
[238:53.99]Are you talking... I'm not sure... There's two Joels.
[238:55.91]Are you talking about Joel, like the Joel that I just hung out with?
[239:00.33]Or Joel the... Trash-talking wrestling?
[239:08.08]Yeah, we talked... He got really busy.
[239:15.56]So, yeah.
[239:16.42]You're talking about... Varg, yeah.
[239:19.88]He got really busy, and he said, I'm really busy, I'm sorry, I was work- he was working on a bunch of stuff, so... We just said, alright, we'll figure it out some other time, you know?
[239:30.24]But he had a lot of projects going on at the time.
[239:33.78]So I'll probably throw the line out eventually here soon.
[239:38.38]We were thinking maybe... Um... No, I- I- no, I- I'll keep that under wraps.
[239:48.07]But there, you'll probably see something interesting.
[239:52.49]Co-op penis stream.
[239:54.57]Why did I read that out loud?
[239:55.86]And second of all, what are you talking about?
[239:59.10]I don't know why I do it.
[239:59.82]I'm telling you.
[240:01.22]I'm so enableable.
[240:02.58]People can just say that.
[240:05.04]I don't have to accept a coffee Cheeto.
[240:07.19]Like, I just, it's just, I have to say it.
[240:09.79]I am like so, you can lead me like with a carrot on a stick into a cliff.
[240:16.05]I will fall off of it.
[240:18.94]I'm very enablable.
[240:22.90]But, yeah.
[240:25.16]We'll see.
[240:25.54]We'll see what happens.
[240:28.10]Cad.
[240:28.56]Thank you, Cad.
[240:29.34]BTV.
[240:30.52]Resident video game developer.
[240:32.76]Thanks to the 250.
[240:34.50]Look at this egomaniac watching his old videos in front of 4,300 people.
[240:38.08]I bet he stares in the mirror for hours talking to himself.
[240:40.30]Yes, I do.
[240:41.02]Yes, that does happen.
[240:44.16]I will just have full conversations with myself in the mirror.
[240:46.92]I do it, like, all the time.
[240:59.90]full.
[241:00.98]A full into the mirror.
[241:04.56]Full frontal.
[241:06.16]And I just do a play to myself.
[241:09.36]And I'm the actor and I'm the audience.
[241:15.75]I knew it.
[241:21.19]He's insane.
[241:27.36]Thank you though.
[241:31.29]Hey, thank you Lulamore for the five dollars.
[241:34.54]Dermot, please do the layers of fear video.
[241:40.18]Not right now.
[241:41.28]Not right now.
[241:41.80]I've got to get out of here.
[241:45.68]Save it for another time.
[241:56.04]Thank you to Frodeon Weapon for the 350.
[241:57.78]Thank you, Frodeon.
[242:01.35]Not to be an attention hog, but you taking my stream name idea made my day.
[242:06.53]To my heart.
[242:07.39]Plus, as much as I love Sam and Max, reminiscing over some of your greatest videos is even better.
[242:10.77]I hope your internet issue gets resolved.
[242:13.09]Happy Sunday.
[242:14.67]Happy Sunday to you as well.
[242:17.53]And, yeah.
[242:20.28]I... I'm good.
[242:21.08]I'm good.
[242:22.86]It'll get fixed.
[242:24.81]Just gotta deal with it for now.
[242:26.25]And we'll get back to normal.
[242:28.13]As of hopefully Monday or Tuesday or so.
[242:32.07]Or if... Wednesday, Tuesday, I'm gonna try as hard as... I'm gonna get up as early as possible tomorrow.
[242:38.44]And make like three phone calls.
[242:41.00]I'm gonna be phone call businessman tomorrow.
[242:43.78]Just you see.
[242:56.40]Frontal mirror stream.
[242:58.22]And then I will be removed from the platform.
[243:00.70]But thank you, Frodeon.
[243:02.08]Thank you, HansBeats, for the five community subs.
[243:04.28]Thanks, Hans.
[243:05.84]Five subs.
[243:06.82]On top of all the other ones that were on tonight.
[243:08.54]Thank you.
[243:12.68]CadBTV, again, 250.
[243:14.74]Would you... Who would you shit your pants for on stream?
[243:20.30]Nobody.
[243:22.24]No one.
[243:23.81]Maybe my mother.
[243:26.64]If my mother needed me to stream with her or something... It would be my mom or... That's probably it.
[243:39.76]If I... Not Kim?
[243:45.16]No, I... No, there's context here.
[243:49.79]There's context here.
[243:50.69]This is not out of... There's context.
[244:00.93]Thank you for the 250.
[244:01.51]Appreciate it.
[244:11.10]Ugh.
[244:15.61]But thank you, StixRenegade for the $2.50.
[244:16.87]Hey, Jerma, with your permission, I want to custom order one car sticker of your Jerma J to put on my sticker-bombed Corolla from those sticker maker websites.
[244:28.04]Is that okay with you?
[244:28.98]If so, I can show you the car when I get the sticker.
[244:32.30]If not, that's completely understandable.
[244:38.00]Oh, you want to have... Oh, I see what you're saying.
[244:39.74]I'm going to call my lawyer and see what he says about that.
[244:48.54]No, that was 9-1-1.
[244:50.00]That's the wrong number.
[244:52.38]That would not be who I would call.
[244:54.72]Hey, nobody was going to steal my copyright.
[244:58.31]Oh, this is the... Well, let's forward you to that department.
[245:13.23]The copyright police.
[245:20.98]Uh, yeah, I mean, I don't have any, like, stickers or anything.
[245:24.59]You know, I might actually make some stuff like that for fun.
[245:29.63]Because I have that Teespring store, and you can make hats, mugs, socks, stickers.
[245:36.97]You can do that.
[245:39.27]So there probably will be more of that added.
[245:42.12]Just for fun.
[245:44.36]I don't expect, you know, thousands of people to be like, Oh, yeah, my merch, buy it!
[245:49.27]But it doesn't, like, cost anything for me to do that.
[245:52.79]So I'm sure I would do it at some point.
[245:57.63]Pins?
[245:57.99]I wonder if they have pins.
[245:58.87]I'll take a look.
[245:59.41]Does Teespring do pins on their stores?
[246:01.31]I don't know.
[246:06.11]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $2.50.
[246:07.04]I did some research for you.
[246:08.30]Here's the origin of that sound.
[246:11.86]Really?
[246:15.00]This is from the BattleBots video.
[246:21.60]That is where that's from.
[246:24.54]Why would he make that a hit sound?
[246:26.97]Of all the things.
[246:28.49]Why?
[246:28.89]It was just me going, oh!
[246:39.02]There wasn't anything spectacular about that.
[246:49.28]Thank you to Talos for the 10 bucks.
[246:52.70]Talos03, thanks for $10.
[246:55.72]As soon as you gave us that heartfelt speech about streaming still being fun after all these years, I went out and got some bits.
[247:01.01]You've got me through some tough times, Jerma.
[247:02.63]I can always count on you to make me laugh.
[247:08.05]It is still fun.
[247:10.05]That's why I tend to get upset when something gets in the way.
[247:18.90]You know, we have a pretty large community here now, and I want it to be fun.
[247:24.18]I don't want it to be like, ah, well, here we go, look at this, look at me!
[247:31.03]120,000 drop frames, cocks!
[247:33.53]And yeah, it's a joke, I know, you guys don't mean half of it sometimes, and it's not a big deal, but it is to me, because I want it to be good, and I want you to enjoy every second of the stream.
[247:41.83]I don't want it to be, you know, well, you know, 15% of that stream was fucked.
[247:48.53]Couldn't even watch it.
[247:55.17]So it means a lot to me.
[247:57.46]That I'm able to do it.
[247:58.88]And it's able that I can do the things that I want to do that day.
[248:03.88]But it is still a blast every time.
[248:05.48]I still have a great fucking time.
[248:07.16]Which means that I'm going to keep doing it.
[248:11.84]I'm happy that you find the streams worth watching.
[248:16.68]Even when there are problems like this, like that happened today with the technical internet kind of stuff.
[248:21.99]Even still.
[248:24.47]That you're able to stick with me there and stick through that.
[248:27.67]Thank you.
[248:32.59]It's worth the pain.
[248:34.12]I hope so.
[248:36.90]But thank you.
[248:43.25]Thank you, Skeleton Toes, for the $5.
[248:44.57]Hey, Jerma.
[248:47.51]I don't you remember, but nearly a year ago, I asked you for some words of encouragement or courage before I went into surgery for my brain condition due to my meds and constant doctor's appointments.
[248:58.32]I've never really gotten the chance to catch your streams, so to say thank you and let you know that everything went fine.
[249:05.49]Not cured, but hey, not dead.
[249:07.85]Thanks for helping me get through that day, and whenever it gets too much
[249:12.57]I'm pretty sure the Fat NG was the first video of yours that I ever saw.
[249:17.35]Well, that's- I'm fucking incredibly happy that you're- that you're alright.
[249:21.04]And that video was... That game was so good.
[249:41.77]I'm so... I'm so grounded and thankful that somebody... That I'm helping you through that.
[249:54.45]That's... I'm glad you're fucking alright.
[250:04.54]Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[250:07.00]And... Stick with it.
[250:15.38]Much love to you, for real.
[250:24.38]That was Skeleton Toes.
[250:37.69]Thank you so much to Zalasky for the $2.50.
[250:42.62]Hey, Yermo, why were you the friend who shows you their favorite movie and says, this is the best part during the whole movie?
[250:54.34]Yeah, I was going like, look, Nick.
[250:57.73]Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
[250:59.93]But, like, most of us have seen the movie, right?
[251:02.29]We've all seen the movie.
[251:03.73]So, you and I are looking at each other, and we're both, yeah, here, yeah, here it comes.
[251:11.31]You know, you've seen the movie, too.
[251:12.43]So, we both, like, are like, yeah, this is it, right here, man.
[251:22.52]And I complained about that person, like, two weeks ago.
[251:24.92]That's fucking funny.
[251:28.30]Alright, let's get the credits on the screen.
[251:29.46]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[251:37.19]There they go.
[251:38.49]Hey, easy peep.
[251:40.99]Easy peep.
[251:42.43]81.
[251:42.59]That's a... That's a pretty good subscription, considering we watched that video.
[251:57.21]Ah, that's fucking fun.
[252:01.36]So we had a few more bits that came through.
[252:02.76]Thank you, everybody, all the subs.
[252:05.29]All the gifted subs, all the re-subs, everybody.
[252:12.33]Might see a redesign of this as well.
[252:15.73]If it's possible, I might have this be changed.
[252:23.88]On top of all the other things that Belordao is in the current process of making right now.
[252:36.66]And we got a couple more bits here.
[252:38.18]We had, uh... My brain just froze.
[252:43.50]I'd ever agree for the $5.
[252:45.60]You have any tips for streaming?
[252:49.06]You're hilarious, dude.
[252:51.44]Tips for streaming would be make sure you're doing it for fun.
[252:54.78]Make sure you're doing it because you want to do it.
[252:57.48]Make sure you're doing it not for money, not for power, not for fame, but because you want to.
[253:02.75]It's very important.
[253:09.02]and do something that you're comfortable doing find your um your zone find your spot that you know that you'd like to do and see what happens power power all you can do is see what happens and just make sure you're realistic with your goals make sure you're realistic with yourself
[253:39.30]And do your best.
[253:47.92]Because at this point, there's a lot of people that stream now.
[253:52.62]And trying to kind of poke your head above the crowd can be very difficult.
[253:58.64]So just stay true to yourself.
[254:00.42]Do what you know that you like to do and that you're good at doing.
[254:04.24]And try to have as much fun as you can.
[254:07.10]And see what happens.
[254:09.35]see what happens power hungry you must accept the power trust Jerma no then you wrote he's short and you there there are plenty of cases of people that start streaming and then they just they grow and they grow and they grow
[254:38.52]It's not like, oh, it's impossible now.
[254:42.90]There's a lot of cases.
[254:43.74]There's always cases of people grabbing some audience.
[254:54.19]But I've had moments like this where I've talked about it before.
[254:59.42]But it's hard to give advice because I know what I do.
[255:03.54]And I know the way that I like to stream and the way the things that I like to try.
[255:08.67]It's hard to give advice to people that might not be the same.
[255:11.09]We might not have the same ideas.
[255:13.23]We might not have the same things we're trying to do on stream.
[255:18.92]There's not a whole lot of real good, like, just advice, like blanket statement advice on how to be a streamer.
[255:24.94]You kind of have to make that on your own.
[255:26.82]You have to figure out what that's going to be.
[255:35.31]Kim is sitting in the hail at soccer practice waiting to be picked up.
[255:45.65]No, she's not.
[255:54.50]But I wish you the best of luck.
[255:57.92]Do it and have fun.
[256:04.97]Is it still hailing?
[256:05.93]No, that was really weird.
[256:07.03]It was just hitting the... Smashing into the windows and stuff.
[256:09.93]It was crazy.
[256:14.25]Dr. Clay at the very end here, thank you for the $2.50.
[256:18.06]Even though the stream was the result of bad internet, I just want to say that it was fun watching this.
[256:22.14]I always enjoyed hearing the comments from the perspective of the creator.
[256:25.30]Nonetheless, hope everything is fixed and you can go back to streaming without issues.
[256:28.75]Take care.
[256:31.21]Me too.
[256:32.39]Me too.
[256:33.03]I hope it's completely gone as of the next day or two.
[256:40.24]Yeah.
[256:41.78]I had a lot of fun on this stream.
[256:43.14]I'm surprised that we were able to go like five hours.
[256:45.28]Kind of just melted.
[256:47.98]The time just sort of disappeared for a little while there.
[256:56.47]Do I like sand?
[256:57.71]Yeah.
[256:59.61]Sand is cool.
[257:05.22]And then finally, right at the end, we had Spooge.
[257:09.50]Thanks for the three bucks.
[257:11.70]Nine months sub now, Jeremy.
[257:14.16]The baby is due.
[257:15.82]But in all seriousness, I wanted to let you know that I had gotten a 30 on my ACT the first try.
[257:20.73]And I almost broke down about it.
[257:23.23]I'm super excited and I appreciate you for being here.
[257:25.87]For all of us who have been stressing about finals in school.
[257:28.87]Love you, man.
[257:29.77]I'll always be here.
[257:30.54]Love every stream.
[257:33.94]First try.
[257:35.65]First try!
[257:39.21]Holy shit.
[257:44.84]Congratulations.
[257:46.06]I've... Thanks for the nine months in a row.
[257:50.16]30 out of 36.
[257:51.78]That's pretty damn good.
[257:57.20]That's pretty damn good.
[258:02.79]30 out of 1600 oh that would not be good who doesn't like sand I don't know I don't know but yeah congratulations on that that you should be pretty you should be very proud of that so thank you everybody that's my time
[258:31.93]uh we just just over five hours okay that's our that's good then I'm okay then I'm alright with this stream I'm alright with it I guess I'm okay I was scared there for a minute that we were only going to get to be live for like an hour and 10 minutes and I would have been really sad about it so I'm alright with that
[258:51.24]I will see you guys hopefully by Tuesday.
[258:55.52]If that is not the case, I will make sure to let you know.
[258:58.16]Just keep an eye on the sus as of Monday night, Tuesday morning.
[259:02.83]I'll make a tweet.
[259:03.77]We'll probably end Tuesday morning and give an update on how things are going.
[259:14.00]Take care, everybody.
[259:15.86]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[259:18.40]See you very soon.
[259:20.32]Tata for now.
[259:40.14]I believe it is currently too early for Legends because I streamed yesterday, so I did that late at night.
[259:48.29]So no stream Legends, unfortunately.
[259:49.95]Sorry, guys.
[259:52.92]See you real soon.
[259:53.46]Have a great night.
