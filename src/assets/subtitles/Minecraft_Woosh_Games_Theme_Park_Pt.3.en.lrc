[00:05.55]Now we're gonna move on to, what's this one?
[00:08.67]Swedish Gladiators.
[00:09.70]I think this one's gonna be pretty difficult, though.
[00:11.52]Alright, alright, that's fine.
[00:14.94]I'm up for a challenge.
[00:16.96]I'm game, I'm game.
[00:18.18]Okay, two players needed.
[00:20.26]Obstacle Race.
[00:22.34]My specialty...
[00:26.48]Okay, blue gladiator is notch.
[00:28.68]Yellow gladiator is jump.
[00:30.58]Reach the diamonds before your opponent.
[00:33.25]If you fall in the water, you should start over.
[00:36.43]Okay.
[00:38.67]So do we have to like push start or do we just go?
[00:40.87]I think there's a start button.
[00:42.81]I think we just go with this pressure plate right here.
[00:47.75]Oh, okay.
[00:48.93]Step on pressure plate to make the game stop.
[00:51.63]And then I am ready.
[00:52.73]There's a button.
[00:53.21]You ready?
[00:54.69]I don't know, man.
[00:55.35]I'm getting kind of nervous.
[00:56.19]Getting those butterflies right before an Olympic race.
[00:59.29]Oh, right before the meet.
[01:00.21]Here we go.
[01:00.62]This is it.
[01:01.66]Oh, you're ready.
[01:02.60]I'm ready.
[01:03.58]Do it.
[01:05.48]Do it.
[01:05.86]Go.
[01:06.14]Oh, running up the ladder.
[01:07.54]Here we go.
[01:08.02]Swedish gladiators.
[01:09.02]Oh, yeah.
[01:11.07]Alright, jumping across an S. Oh, wow, that was close.
[01:14.33]I'm not gonna risk this one.
[01:15.45]I'm not risking that.
[01:16.01]Oh, well, how do I get over here?
[01:17.09]Triple jump.
[01:18.39]Oh.
[01:18.99]Wow.
[01:19.59]I was gonna wait and see how you did that.
[01:20.99]No, you didn't.
[01:21.77]Now what do you do?
[01:23.15]I'm going through some kind of crazy obstacle course.
[01:27.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:30.00]Okay, I get it.
[01:30.66]I get it.
[01:31.52]Oh, they're trying to push me off the edge now.
[01:32.92]They're trying to push me off.
[01:34.08]Oh, my God!
[01:35.70]Oh!
[01:36.32]I'm in the water.
[01:37.30]I'm in the water.
[01:37.98]Me too.
[01:38.58]Me too.
[01:39.10]Oh, jeez.
[01:39.56]Swimming back.
[01:40.50]Oh, wow.
[01:40.96]That's... Okay.
[01:41.42]Alright.
[01:42.18]So, it's patience.
[01:43.00]Patience is the most important thing with this one.
[01:45.73]So, do we have to... Patience is a virtue.
[01:47.41]We have to start all the way from the beginning?
[01:49.65]I think so.
[01:51.55]Oh, I'm... I think so.
[01:52.73]I forgot to give us bread before this.
[01:54.11]I hope we don't run out of food to sprint.
[01:56.58]Sorry, I'm going.
[01:57.60]Are you going?
[01:58.68]I'm back on the track, but I'm at the beginning of it.
[02:00.42]I'm already up the ladder.
[02:02.16]I'm already up that ladder.
[02:03.02]Oh, I... Spoke too soon, did we?
[02:08.22]You see, I was trying to rush it because I wanted to get ahead of you.
[02:10.54]Oh, I fell again.
[02:11.10]Oh, you fell again, too.
[02:13.73]Okay, that's good.
[02:14.29]I can take my time.
[02:17.41]Oh, no.
[02:19.01]There I go again.
[02:21.47]I fell in.
[02:21.99]Uh-oh, I glitched.
[02:24.27]I fell in.
[02:25.82]So here we go.
[02:26.20]Alright, I'm not gonna fail on this one.
[02:28.62]I already fell!
[02:29.68]I fell on, like, the easiest one.
[02:31.72]I fell, like, at square one.
[02:35.00]I fell again!
[02:36.18]No, don't go.
[02:38.53]Wait, wait, wait, go!
[02:39.07]Oh, it pushed me off again.
[02:43.45]Oh!
[02:43.93]Oh, I made it across the one I got stuck on.
[02:45.77]I made it across.
[02:46.41]Alright, so, you have to just make this jump.
[02:49.95]And then there's water.
[02:51.81]No!
[02:52.59]No, come on.
[02:54.13]Alright, come on.
[02:57.17]Alright, going across the water.
[02:59.47]How do you get across the water?
[03:02.08]You gotta sprint, and then you gotta stop, and then we'll start.
[03:05.54]I don't know, my brain is too scrambled right now.
[03:07.42]Alright, alright, alright.
[03:08.38]How far did you get?
[03:09.04]How far did you get?
[03:09.72]I got after the minecart, after the thing, after the minecart.
[03:15.77]I beat that.
[03:16.81]That's it.
[03:18.11]Alright, I am now at the minecarts.
[03:19.45]Do not get trampled by the minecarts.
[03:23.07]So, how do you not get trampled?
[03:24.81]They're just, like, coming out randomly?
[03:27.25]They come out, they come around in a circle and you have to go around.
[03:30.83]Oh, jeez.
[03:31.79]So, so where, where do you stop?
[03:35.60]After the minecarts part, I beat that part.
[03:38.02]And then the part after that, I beat that, and then I was stuck right there.
[03:42.20]Alright, I got past the minecarts.
[03:45.47]Go.
[03:47.53]The next part is, took me, like, three drives to get that.
[03:53.56]Oh, I'm... Alright, here we go.
[03:54.76]I... My brain... No!
[03:59.68]I almost had it!
[04:00.80]I almost had it.
[04:01.52]That was so close.
[04:06.28]Oh, I got past that one.
[04:07.10]That was much easier than I thought it was gonna be.
[04:08.73]Alright.
[04:11.41]I'm not gonna screw this up.
[04:12.53]I'm not gonna screw this up.
[04:13.59]Not gonna screw this up.
[04:16.43]Oh.
[04:16.55]Alright, this one... I don't think I have to double jump for this one.
[04:20.33]I'm gonna freak myself out.
[04:22.43]No, I didn't.
[04:22.91]Okay.
[04:23.29]Alright.
[04:23.55]I'm going to win it.
[04:25.01]I'm going to... So do you have to just tipsy-turvy on this thing or what?
[04:31.01]I don't know where you're at.
[04:31.67]Oh, man.
[04:33.14]I'm sneaking.
[04:34.44]Is that going to do anything at all?
[04:35.40]I have no idea.
[04:38.18]Oh, for all the time it took.
[04:40.82]I completed it.
[04:42.36]Get some wool and try to hit the basket to open the door?
[04:46.63]What?
[04:47.99]What do I have to do?
[04:51.79]Oh, I have to throw it?
[04:53.69]Hey, Jerma.
[04:56.11]Hey, Jerma.
[04:56.63]I'm trying to end it.
[04:58.15]Yeah?
[04:59.81]Take a look around.
[05:02.25]Did you complete it?
[05:04.17]You beat it before I did?
[05:05.71]Take a look around.
[05:08.87]So, is this it?
[05:10.35]I'm dancing on diamonds right now, man.
[05:14.69]You son of a bitch.
[05:17.10]I can't believe it.
[05:20.24]Get a minecart and launch it.
[05:21.60]Make sure to right-click the button, don't left-click it.
[05:25.48]Woohoo!
[05:27.02]What?
[05:29.48]This didn't do anything.
[05:31.52]Oh, I just... Yeah.
[05:35.82]You just, like, left me in the dust back here.
[05:38.73]You're like, ah, that's my button, son.
[05:40.75]No one else can...
[05:44.01]Apparently there's a zombie doing it as well, the obstacle.
[05:47.13]He's on my side.
[05:48.09]He's like doing it.
[05:48.71]Look at him.
[05:49.00]He's like, oh, I want to do it too!
[05:49.96]Yeah, I see him up there.
[05:53.28]He's just getting ready to jump on that glass.
[05:57.16]Hardest game in the park.
[06:03.01]Players needed to.
[06:03.97]Game description, hardest game in the park, PvP, adventure, and parkour.
[06:10.61]Oh, I'm so happy that this is the hardest.
[06:13.03]There is not one, but two signs that say this is the hardest game in the park.
[06:19.02]Ugh.
[06:20.04]This, like, scares me.
[06:21.56]Divide the astronauts red or blue.
[06:22.98]You're blue, so you go blue.
[06:24.70]I'm red, so I'll go red, because we are racist.
[06:29.38]Ow, I just hit myself with the door.
[06:31.34]Alright, minecarts.
[06:33.04]Welcome to Space Race.
[06:34.40]Please come in.
[06:35.14]The hardest game in the park.
[06:37.40]Did you get a minecart?
[06:37.92]And I'm not looking forward to this.
[06:39.83]I just clicked it.
[06:42.40]Put your minecart here.
[06:43.48]Where is it now?
[06:45.00]Oh, okay.
[06:46.24]Now what?
[06:46.82]Oh, this is the launch block.
[06:49.78]Wait.
[06:50.37]Oh, so this is where the game actually starts?
[06:53.83]Fill the yellow wall on your right with a total of 72 TNT.
[06:57.53]And use armor.
[07:02.60]Don't forget to use armor or you'll die on the landing.
[07:04.92]Fill the yellow wall on your left with the...
[07:12.04]Oh, jeez.
[07:13.53]How do we place it?
[07:16.13]Do we press the launch button right now?
[07:17.83]I don't know.
[07:20.91]I just pushed it.
[07:22.51]Did you push it?
[07:24.07]I did.
[07:26.45]Oh, that sets the TNT off.
[07:29.83]How do you place the TNT?
[07:30.99]You climb up the ladder and place it where it'll be touching the redstone wire.
[07:37.34]You know what I'm saying?
[07:41.31]I guess.
[07:42.69]I'm just like placing it everywhere.
[07:44.87]Well, it's just gonna be like a single row of three going all the way up.
[07:53.37]Alright, I'm detonating.
[07:56.87]You're detonating?
[07:57.73]I guess.
[07:59.57]I don't get it.
[08:01.87]You see how high up I am?
[08:05.47]You're supposed to be building TNT all the way up that high.
[08:10.61]Oh, here we go.
[08:11.31]I'm coming with you.
[08:13.75]And, like, three rows of it, all the way up to the top.
[08:19.35]This is gonna, like, break the server.
[08:22.21]I know, right?
[08:24.45]Alright, alright, I'm at the top.
[08:25.60]I'm at the top.
[08:26.12]Alright, uh... Oh, oh!
[08:33.76]I... Oh god, I'm stuck.
[08:35.24]Alright, I just did all of them.
[08:36.24]Oh god.
[08:41.80]Alright, I'm detonating.
[08:43.04]Detonate!
[08:45.52]Um, now what do we do?
[08:46.58]We stay in the water, I think.
[08:48.08]I don't know what's about to happen.
[08:49.06]This is gonna get nasty.
[08:53.23]Oh, what just happened?
[08:54.49]Oh my god.
[08:56.09]I think we did it wrong.
[08:58.67]Did we just blow up the whole amusement?
[09:00.77]I think we did it wrong.
[09:02.36]See these planets back here?
[09:03.72]I think we were supposed to, like... Oh, we were supposed to stand on top of this block.
[09:11.62]Oh, wow.
[09:12.12]That didn't work out so well.
[09:14.81]Alright, um... Well... Hooray!
[09:19.63]We did it!
[09:21.23]We blew up the amusement park!
[09:23.09]Alright, alright, alright.
[09:25.33]Well, come back over here to my side.
[09:26.63]How did you blow that up?
[09:28.83]Look at my side and look at yours.
[09:32.66]You gotta telephone me.
[09:33.50]I just... Life felt for the world.
[09:36.88]Alright, let's just do a game of spleef.
[09:38.36]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[09:39.74]You gotta come over here, though.
[09:40.66]You gotta come over here.
[09:42.26]I am at the bottom of the world.
[09:45.08]It's all dark and scary and mysterious.
[09:47.23]Teleport.
[09:49.29]Oh, you're still alive?
[09:51.31]Yeah.
[09:53.39]Alright.
[09:53.89]Look at my side and look at your side.
[09:56.99]Okay, your side looks cool.
[10:00.02]And... My side is, like, perfect.
[10:07.81]What?
[10:08.09]I, like, did what I was supposed to.
[10:09.47]I blew up the Wii U. Apparently not.
[10:11.89]You blew up, like, everything.
[10:13.42]It's just gone.
[10:14.68]Like, the whole thing is gone.
[10:16.08]I don't... My side is, like, completely pristine.
[10:27.03]I don't even know.
