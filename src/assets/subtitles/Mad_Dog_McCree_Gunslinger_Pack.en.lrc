[02:02.98]Did I ruin everything?
[02:04.56]No.
[02:09.40]Yeah, today we're gonna play a special video game.
[02:14.52]Bought it on Amazon.
[02:17.44]It's none other than Mad Dog McCree.
[02:20.17]No relation to Overwatch.
[02:23.20]So let's see how fun this game is.
[02:24.28]It's kind of like the Fast Draw Showdown.
[02:28.21]We'll see.
[02:28.77]We'll take a look at it.
[02:30.03]I'm going to grab a drink.

[04:03.42]It's all fucked up.
[04:04.82]I guess we're using an Elgato HD60.
[04:07.92]And let me tell you, the Elgato HD60, wow, what a product!
[04:12.74]What a fucking product this is.
[04:14.16]What a good product.
[04:15.79]Just kidding.
[04:18.75]If you're like fucking friend or grandmother, if you get this for a present, if you get the Elgato HD60 for a present, throw it in the trash in front of the person that gave it to you.
[04:29.23]And then pee in the trash can.

[09:23.52]I don't even know what happened.
[09:28.18]So, let me try to explain what happened there.
[09:30.03]I shot two innocent people.
[09:32.11]The guy told me, don't do that again.
[09:33.61]I got shot by the bad guy, and the guy next to me pretended to die.
[09:38.17]And then the coroner told me I was gonna be okay.
[09:42.29]With great start.
[09:43.83]I'm happy about this.
[09:45.03]Alright, we're going to go to the bank.

[09:52.38]Got him.
[09:53.12]That's two in a row.
[09:53.68]How do you reload?
[09:54.80]How do you reload?
[09:55.48]Okay, you got to go off screen.
[09:58.54]There's more in time.
[09:59.60]I shot that guy right in the face and he's okay.
[10:02.68]Hold on, we got more.

[10:07.26]Right up the middle.

[10:38.90]People just kind of roll over and die.
[10:40.56]It's funny that A, that's A. Okay, we're going to go to bank.
[10:47.61]Let's go for it.
[10:52.59]Got him.

[10:53.75]Got him.
[10:54.61]Reload it.
[10:57.27]That's so bad.
[10:58.31]I love how you shoot him and he just rolls out of the way.
[11:04.44]I shot that guy fucking four times!
[11:07.88]Looks like this good old boy has seen his last gunfight.
[11:10.80]Does anybody understand what just happened?
[11:12.86]I shot that guy directly in his fucking face.
[11:18.48]Okay, hold on.
[11:19.62]Game over.
[11:20.30]Shoot the screen to continue.
[11:23.02]It's showdown time, stranger.
[11:25.36]So holster your iron.
[11:26.68]We're gonna see how fast you can draw.
[11:28.84]You'll either be mighty quick or, well, that's why we gotta boot Hill.
[11:34.19]It keeps giving me these different scenarios.
[11:41.23]What the fuck is going on here?
[11:44.99]Looks like this good old boy has seen his last gunfight.
[11:48.56]That doesn't even... That's not even part of the game.
[11:50.88]Time to take him to Boot Hill.
[11:54.58]You think you're in the middle of a hurricane now?
[11:57.02]It's time for a showdown.
[11:58.82]Why is he doing this?
[12:01.44]Why do they keep doing... I'm just gonna aim at him.
[12:04.31]Fuck it, I don't need to holster the gun.
[12:07.05]Apparently I do.
[12:07.69]I'm dead again.
[12:08.85]Looks like this good old boy has seen his last gunfight.
[12:16.48]Why don't I have any bullets in my gun?
[12:17.96]Look, it's going to come back.
[12:22.32]It's going to be a new scenario.
[12:25.06]Look, it's another... You just jumped from the frying pan into the fire.
[12:28.17]You dusted crazy Sam's brother.
[12:30.69]Now the crazy varmint's waiting for you over yonder.
[12:34.82]I love how they keep coming back to life.
[12:37.19]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:37.87]How do I know?
[12:39.17]Where's my bullets?
[12:39.75]How do I shoot?
[12:40.23]How do I do this?
[12:41.49]I don't have any bullets in my fucking gun.
[12:43.17]There's nothing in there.
[12:44.91]Now there is.
[12:45.31]I keep being revived.
[12:52.67]I keep dying.
[12:55.25]They keep bringing me back to life and putting me in a situation where I can't win.
[13:00.78]This is a sick joke.
[13:03.46]Look at the revolver!
[13:05.82]I got six shots.
[13:07.02]I get it.
[13:08.92]Now, how come I have zero shots?
[13:14.42]No, no, no.
[13:14.92]Okay, how do I reload it?
[13:16.00]What do I do?
[13:19.23]Like, I don't have any bullets in this gun!
[13:20.95]Alright, no, we're just gonna let it count down.
[13:27.07]This is like, something's going on here.
[13:29.87]No bullets because I didn't holster?
[13:31.01]I'm pointing the Wiimote down at the ground!
[13:33.96]and I can't reload it.
[13:34.72]Okay, well, who cares?
[13:40.23]Let's try this again.
[13:41.47]Deputy, single player.
[13:43.07]Alright, I have three lives here.
[13:49.21]Let's see what happens.
[13:50.19]Don't shoot the random people that stare at you.
[13:53.33]Stranger!
[13:54.15]This guy.
[13:54.51]Stranger!
[13:56.07]Howdy, stranger.
[13:57.49]We need your help.
[13:59.11]Mad Dog McCree's gang is taking over the town.
[14:01.93]I love this guy, by the way.
[14:02.97]Mayor and his daughter have been taken hostage out to Mad Dog's hideout.
[14:07.40]Sheriff, he's locked up in jail.
[14:09.04]We're going to have to get him out to help with the gang.
[14:12.54]Can you help?
[14:14.14]Good.
[14:16.25]Uh, one more import play.
[14:18.10]Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:20.38]I wasn't fucking ready for that shit.
[14:22.76]I wasn't ready.
[14:23.42]I, like, was listening to the dumb cutscene and how he's dead and I'm dead because he's dead.
[14:29.90]What the fuck?
[14:31.18]No, endgame.
[14:32.98]We're going back.
[14:33.46]We're doing it again.
[14:34.24]We're just skipping the cutscene.
[14:35.66]Skip.
[14:36.32]Got him.
[14:37.40]Alright, we're good.
[14:41.82]We're fine.
[14:43.10]What the fuck are you doing over here?
[14:45.35]Another one gonna come at me?
[14:46.13]Here comes another one.
[14:48.19]Alright, here we go.
[14:49.57]So he's in a saloon.
[14:51.33]I gotta go to the saloon first.
[14:52.88]Oh wait, we're gonna get... Nice... What?
[14:53.92]Here we go, he's gonna land on his neck.
[14:57.88]Wait, it's like a slow motion.
[15:19.29]That was awesome.
[15:20.13]I hope there's more of those.
[15:23.73]Then his hat comes off, too.
[15:24.75]Okay, there's gotta be more of those, right?
[15:27.19]Who's the bad guy?
[15:28.93]Nice punches.
[15:29.61]Nice stage acting.
[15:31.88]Which one do I shoot?
[15:32.50]Who's the bad guy?
[15:34.60]Ooh, right in the stomach!
[15:35.74]And then right in the face.
[15:38.78]That was unbelievable stage acting.
[15:42.88]He's that one.
[15:45.90]Come here, come here.
[15:46.46]Be careful, that's Mad Dog's boys over there.
[15:51.10]Got him!
[15:54.91]Looking at my keys, stranger?
[15:56.43]Be careful, that's Mad Dog.
[16:01.09]I'm an extra.
[16:01.91]I don't even know how to act like a Mad Dog's guy.
[16:11.95]Why did he shoot him?
[16:13.57]Why did he shoot him?
[16:14.33]You better work on your sharpshooting, stranger.
[16:18.24]You only got two levels left.
[16:25.34]Oh, we gotta do this again.
[16:39.59]Looking at my keys, stranger?
[16:41.27]Nice keys.
[16:42.71]You wouldn't be trying to get the sheriff out of jail now, would you?
[16:45.53]Of course I would.
[16:46.25]Show him what we did in trouble.
[16:50.79]What?
[16:50.99]I shot him fucking six times.
[16:55.39]I unloaded my whole gun on him.
[16:57.47]You see that guy laugh over there?
[16:58.71]You can go look at the guy on the left.
[16:59.55]The left side was just laughing.
[17:01.27]That guy, that was a laugh.
[17:03.65]Then they kept it.

[18:03.71]I have no bullets in the gun.
[18:05.99]Right there, I was holstered pointing at the ground.
[18:08.65]We're gonna let this count down again.
[18:19.02]You gotta get him first try.
[18:21.46]No, you gotta hit him in the time frame of... Hey, the video will recognize you shot the gun.
[18:31.95]Like, I just shot that guy right there.

[18:34.09]I shot him twice.
[18:35.29]I have to shoot him in there like, please let the video edit in the right spot.
[18:38.53]Point of the game.
[18:40.35]Alright, well, can you move out of the way?
[18:43.47]I don't want to shoot you.
[18:44.11]Saloon.
[18:44.33]Offscreen?
[18:44.57]I know.
[18:45.17]It doesn't do anything when you're in that mode.
[18:48.19]Okay, we're doing this again.
[18:49.53]We're going to get this one.
[18:59.11]There's this guy up here.
[18:59.89]There's this amazing super slow-mo.
[19:08.20]I love we get to watch that again.

[19:19.71]We can skip this, right?
[19:21.69]No, we can't skip this.
[19:22.79]We have to watch these two act together.
[19:29.00]They just disappear to off-screen.
[19:32.02]Okay, here we go.
[19:32.80]Here he comes again.
[19:33.68]Hey!
[19:37.92]Be careful, that's Mad Dog's boys over there.
[19:41.84]I fucking love this.
[19:42.82]Hey, are you looking at my keys?
[19:46.36]Looking at my keys, stranger?
[19:48.04]No, I wasn't.
[19:49.48]You wouldn't be trying to get the sheriff out of jail now.
[19:51.73]This guy, this guy, this guy.
[19:52.83]Chaco!
[19:53.57]Huh?
[19:54.37]Show him off.
[20:01.33]And the guy in the back.
[20:07.77]I shot that guy in the chest and he did that.
[20:10.22]What's left?
[20:11.66]Hold on.
[20:13.32]Thanks, stranger.
[20:14.04]I'll forever be holding to you.
[20:16.66]Nice.
[20:17.28]I know you're looking for the Mad Dog.
[20:19.87]Where is he?
[20:20.19]But remember one thing.
[20:22.67]He wears a bulletproof vest.
[20:24.61]And here's the keys.
[20:27.50]Oh, nice.
[20:29.02]He wears a bulletproof... Oh, wait, he was pouring that drink for me.
[20:32.08]I thought that was my drink.
[20:34.98]Okay, well, we beat the saloon.
[20:38.46]Now we're going to go to the sheriff's office.
[20:43.37]Get that little kid out of here.
[20:47.21]Okay, well, here he is.
[20:49.57]That guy just tripped over the railing.
[20:51.07]I didn't do anything.
[20:52.23]I missed that guy.
[20:53.29]Oh!
[20:57.57]Well, I don't know if that was the guy, the good guy or the bad guy, but I shot him in the face.
[21:00.13]I don't know.
[21:02.35]That might have been the guy.
[21:02.95]Thank God you're here with the keys.
[21:04.17]I got to get out of here.
[21:08.89]Mad Dog, you don't stand a chance.
[21:13.16]Let's go get him, stranger.
[21:16.12]He wasn't even there.
[21:16.76]What, it took you that long to... Did he die?
[21:28.13]Oh, I think he died.
[21:28.93]Wait, here we go.
[21:29.47]Big drop.
[21:30.73]Big drop.
[21:32.89]Okay, that was a dummy.
[21:35.85]I think that was a dumb- The map to the hideout's in the mine, but you've got to talk to the prospector first.
[21:46.81]Oh my god, that was unbelievable.
[21:50.83]Okay, I love how he got shot and just did this very slow, like he was in an elevator and going down in an elevator.
[21:59.50]That guy didn't get shot.
[22:00.44]He was going down to his hotel room.
[22:04.32]Bad guy?
[22:04.82]Holster that gun and get ready to draw.
[22:07.90]I am.
[22:08.92]I fucking am.
[22:09.94]That's what I don't understand.
[22:11.88]Something's going on with this holstering thing.
[22:14.36]Fuck.
[22:15.92]It don't matter where the gun... I could be pointing it down, up.
[22:18.63]It don't matter.
[22:20.67]God damn it.
[22:21.37]Okay.
[22:23.17]I'm at the ground right now.
[22:24.05]I swear to God.
[22:24.95]Holster that gun and get ready to draw.
[22:27.97]Something's going wrong here.
[22:30.27]I don't even know what I did!
[22:31.01]I didn't- I did everything the same exact same- That guy's not a- What?
[22:34.65]He's dead.
[22:36.29]He became part of the haystack.
[22:37.47]Good.
[22:38.81]Who's next?
[22:41.54]What the fuck was that?
[22:44.54]You better get like- Who just fucking shot me?
[22:47.50]Oh, no.
[22:49.08]Hoster that gun and get ready to draw.
[22:58.20]Fuck me!
[23:00.56]I think you're in the middle of a hur- Yeah, shut up.
[23:07.40]Alright, I got it.
[23:08.48]I figured it out.
[23:11.44]It's alright, we got our life back.
[23:13.04]Let's do this again.
[23:15.18]Trying to do this to Wiimote is so much harder than it looks.
[23:20.60]Okay, where is this?
[23:21.42]Where is he?
[23:21.72]In here?
[23:22.70]Where's the sniper?
[23:25.20]Where's the guy with the fucking gun?
[23:26.76]Like, up here?
[23:29.98]Where?
[23:32.41]Where is this guy?
[23:35.13]This guy doesn't exist.
[23:36.17]We're going to the bank.
[23:45.03]So far, so good.
[23:45.73]That guy's gonna wake back up.
[23:47.00]I know it.
[23:47.72]Why would he still be on screen?
[23:50.72]There's more inside!
[23:51.72]Okay, thanks.
[23:57.95]Look at that guy appeared in the spot that he shouldn't have.
[24:00.57]That's great.
[24:00.91]Here comes the roll.
[24:02.43]No, not yet.
[24:03.31]Come on.
[24:04.91]God damn it.
[24:07.50]Ah.
[24:11.26]That guy just fell down.
[24:19.18]I shot the fucking lady.
[24:20.78]Oh, fucking God.
[24:22.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:28.65]Population 64.
[24:29.67]Let's do it again.
[24:34.12]Oh, no, you gotta fight this guy.
[24:35.66]The same guy you've shot like ten times.
[24:41.40]No, you didn't hit him.
[24:44.28]Sorry, soldier.
[24:44.92]You just shot him six times in the stomach.
[24:48.86]God damn it.
[24:49.62]Okay, let's go.
[24:59.85]Here we go again.
[25:00.51]I missed that guy by a mile.
[25:12.69]Got him.
[25:14.99]Don't even tell me I shot the lady.
[25:16.35]That's bullshit.
[25:16.97]I shot the guy in the arm.
[25:18.33]I did not shoot that lady.
[25:19.27]Emphasis on the was.
[25:27.06]You guys all saw that.
[25:27.90]I shot him in the fucking... That's not fair.
[25:31.64]Here we go again.
[25:42.22]Okay, so what do I do now?
[25:43.72]Just don't shoot the gun.
[25:46.24]They're both good guys apparently?
[25:47.86]Or what?
[25:54.46]Why do I have to keep coming out to talk to this guy?
[25:56.32]That dog will get me for telling you this.
[25:58.20]But if you get to the hideout, don't approach from the front.
[26:03.38]Nice hiding place.
[26:05.36]Behind a barrel.
[26:06.01]Alright.
[26:06.91]Can we please figure out where I'm getting shot from here?
[26:10.45]Host to that gun and get ready to draw.
[26:16.03]Oh, my God.
[26:18.33]Oh, fuck on.
[26:21.49]This is so irritating.
[26:22.77]Alright, where is this person?
[26:32.00]There's a magic person that shoots.
[26:33.82]From where?
[26:34.46]I don't know.
[26:34.88]Does anybody have... I'm just gonna shoot over here.
[26:37.96]I think I got him.
[26:39.22]Yeah, I got him.
[26:40.94]There's a magic ghost person there.
[26:47.26]That's such a tiny little fucking spot.
[26:51.25]God damn, give me a break.
[26:57.25]That guy was so well hidden.
[27:02.50]Thank God.
[27:06.80]It's so hard to aim with this.
[27:08.20]Oh, come on.
[27:09.10]Thank goodness I got him.
[27:15.37]Alright, come on.
[27:15.99]It can't be more than that.
[27:29.44]He's still alive.
[27:30.14]I took him so long to do that.
[27:36.36]Of course I'm gonna get him.
[27:38.80]That guy was struggling so hard.
[27:40.52]Uh-oh, here we go.
[27:42.73]I think this is Mad Dog McCree.
[27:48.30]I think I just got him.
[27:49.40]I think I just got Mad Dog McCree.
[27:53.02]He had a heart attack on his horse.
[27:56.34]I did it.
[27:58.58]Prospect of mine.
[27:59.62]Hideout.
[28:02.75]Hideout.
[28:03.63]Um... Uh-oh.
[28:10.43]What do I do about this?
[28:11.23]Shoot the fuse!
[28:14.47]Shoot the fuse!
[28:15.63]Shoot the fuse!
[28:22.40]Thanks, stranger.
[28:23.58]God damn it.
[28:24.62]I should have let it explode.
[28:27.12]I should have let it explode.
[28:28.72]Shoot the lantern to get in the mine.
[28:31.36]Go for it.
[28:32.30]What was I thinking?
[28:33.47]What was I thinking?
[28:35.15]Prospector.
[28:35.71]We're doing it again.
[28:36.29]I can't do it again.
[28:37.27]Fuck.
[28:37.93]Why did I do that?
[28:40.19]Now this mine is booby trapped for claim jumpers.
[28:43.61]You also need to shoot out the pitchfork.
[28:46.22]What?
[28:53.65]I did it.
[28:54.03]I shot the... I did what he told me to do.
[28:57.56]Well, I'd rather be lucky than good.
[29:01.74]You took a bad hit.
[29:04.10]But it looks like... Wait, what?
[29:08.95]Apparently I died?
[29:09.67]Now this mine is booby-trapped for claim jumpers.
[29:12.93]You also need to shoot out the gold mining pan.
[29:19.48]It just explodes.
[29:21.68]If you take too long, it just explodes.
[29:23.78]And I'm dead.
[29:26.98]You better get lucky, or you're gonna be dead.
[29:30.82]You've only got one life left.
[29:34.42]Okay.
[29:35.54]I don't... Why does it just explode?
[29:38.14]What do I do?
[29:39.98]I don't get it.
[29:40.64]Shoot the lantern.
[29:41.76]Shoot the... I'm fucking dead again.
[30:01.37]It's so funny.
[30:07.33]Oh, I wish I could do the prospector again.
[30:08.96]Now this mine is booby-trapped for claim jumpers.
[30:13.48]What the fuck?
[30:16.26]I just did it.
[30:17.32]I just shot the pan.
[30:20.08]Why do I keep exploding?
[30:21.06]I don't understand.
[30:21.76]It's right there.
[30:22.26]What?
[30:22.38]I just did it.
[30:23.68]Apparently, I just did it.
[30:25.12]Oh, he doesn't...
[30:49.26]You missed that one.
[30:50.66]Try another.
[30:54.40]You missed that one.
[30:55.81]Try another.
[30:59.55]You missed that one.
[31:00.95]Try another.
[31:04.15]You missed that one.
[31:05.55]Try another.
[31:07.17]I can't even fucking do this.
[31:08.79]You missed that one.
[31:10.19]Try another.
[31:11.43]I can't do it.
[31:12.31]I don't have any balls.
[31:13.93]You missed that one.
[31:15.33]Try another.
[31:19.00]Nice shoot.
[31:20.23]Try another one.
[31:21.09]No, what?
[31:21.39]I have to do it again?
[31:23.83]You missed that one.
[31:25.23]Try another.
[31:27.85]I can't.
[31:28.43]You missed that one.
[31:29.25]Yeah, I gotta take a second.
[31:30.09]Try another.
[31:30.73]I gotta take a minute.
[31:32.49]Why does he keep hitting me?
[31:33.60]You missed that one.
[31:34.98]Try another.
[31:37.12]This guy's been drinking like a 30 rack.
[31:39.62]Try another one.
[31:40.50]No, I don't want to do another one.
[31:42.94]My fucking god.
[31:45.34]Why did we do this?
[31:46.32]Now, you better get out there and find Mad Dog.
[31:48.74]Why did we have to do this?
[31:49.82]This guy's a sick fuck.
[31:55.44]Try another.
[31:56.74]Hey, you missed that one.
[31:57.97]Try another.
[31:59.75]Okay, what kind of map is this?
[32:03.85]Map to hideout.
[32:09.73]Hideout.
[32:11.39]Oh, shit.
[32:13.21]Anybody pay attention to that?
[32:16.67]I think it was right.
[32:18.53]Yep.
[32:19.40]This guy's a... Yeah, got ya.
[32:24.68]Oh, my... My nose.
[32:30.72]I just shot fucking boogers everywhere.
[32:34.51]I got a sex drop to, like, acid.
[32:38.93]Some people... I love this game.
[32:41.07]These are the best games ever.
[32:43.55]Hideout.
[32:43.99]Take a...
[32:47.80]Oh, I'm having trouble right now.
[32:53.29]Oh my god, I fucking love it.
[32:56.77]I love how that guy got Joker dropped in acid.
[32:59.81]That was unbelievable.
[33:01.07]I can't even do this right now.
[33:06.37]Fucking, what a fantastic game.
[33:11.30]That death sound.
[33:13.14]That guy had like an ADR dubbed over death sound.
[33:17.61]Hideout.
[33:18.11]Okay.
[33:19.01]Here we go.
[33:23.33]Who's left?
[33:23.75]Come on.
[33:25.63]Say it was the same exact person.
[33:31.58]Okay, good.
[33:32.98]Then it was right again.
[33:38.28]Got him.
[33:39.46]Got him.
[33:42.92]Easy.
[33:48.20]That guy like blended in with the fucking tree.
[33:50.12]That guy's hair was the tree.
[33:51.62]Ugh.
[33:52.79]Oh, god damn it.
[33:53.57]We're gonna go left.
[33:54.45]No, we're not.
[33:54.77]What the fuck?
[33:55.37]Can I see the map again?
[33:58.37]What the hell?
[34:06.75]Why did they all laugh?
[34:09.05]Why did they all laugh?
[34:11.21]Okay, that means I went the wrong way.
[34:17.35]That's not what people in the Wild West used to do.
[34:19.91]They didn't have evil laughs.
[34:23.79]Alright, we're getting close.
[34:39.14]alright so it was like right right I have no idea left okay no I'm dead they're all going to laugh at me oh off I love how you have to do this every time you want to continue
[35:06.31]Alright, right.
[35:07.82]Right.
[35:08.92]Right.
[35:11.34]I didn't even get a chance to know what I was even doing.
[35:14.60]Like, honest to God.
[35:25.16]I love these grunts.
[35:33.07]Come on.
[35:33.43]Okay, entrance.
[35:37.41]Oh, I wonder if I should walk in the front door.
[35:49.24]That's a real fucking horse.
[35:54.32]What?
[35:55.94]Hold on a second.
[35:56.78]What on fucking Earth did we just watch?
[36:01.09]I want to do the front door, even though I was told not to.
[36:03.71]Okay, well, I can't do anything about this.
[36:10.04]Let's listen.
[36:11.54]You can hear a guy in the background say, whoa.
[36:20.65]Oh, my God.
[36:21.21]This is so lame.
[36:22.91]I don't want to do that again, man.
[36:24.23]Come on.
[36:24.94]Alright, we're good.
[36:32.28]I know where to go.
[36:33.04]I can skip it all.
[36:36.09]Right.
[36:36.77]Just right three times.
[36:37.99]That's like so stupid.
[36:39.59]Rear.
[36:39.87]Here we go.
[36:40.51]Mad Dog McCree, where are you?
[36:43.83]He's gonna pop up and we're gonna fucking insta-kill him.
[36:46.37]He's gonna be one of these shitty enemies.
[36:56.07]Okay, come on.
[36:57.67]None of this shaky cam bullshit.
[36:58.93]What is this shaky cam?
[37:02.84]What was the point of that?
[37:09.64]What's going on?
[37:12.90]Where was that guy?
[37:16.28]That guy wasn't even part of the act.
[37:21.03]That guy wasn't even on camera.
[37:23.23]I turned around and there was a guy with a gun behind me.
[37:27.81]Okay.
[37:29.93]That didn't make any fucking sense.
[37:31.52]Alright, we have to shoot the smokestack and then a guy runs up.
[37:39.44]What is it?
[37:39.94]Okay, so, okay, oh no, oh no, there's a fire in here.
[37:44.30]Now what?
[37:50.92]What is happening?
[37:53.70]You better get lucky.
[37:55.10]A guy fucking runs out screaming.
[37:57.62]And then I got shot by a close-up.
[38:02.38]Do I just need to shoot with a guy before he even gets out?
[38:04.43]I feel like he shoots the gun once.
[38:07.49]I'm super confused.
[38:11.19]Alright, shoot the fuckin' smokestack.
[38:12.73]Alright, here comes a guy.
[38:16.47]Wait!
[38:31.79]You keep shootin' the innocent people and ain't gonna be none left to save.
[38:37.11]Wait!
[38:41.27]I don't understand this whole thing, man.
[38:45.09]It was Paul Farrow.
[38:47.06]I was like, what's the hell?
[38:52.38]Why was that guy innocent?
[38:54.86]I just skipped a bunch of video files and the guy ran out.
[38:58.48]Wait, wait, don't skip all these video files so fast.
[39:01.37]You're not supposed to shoot me.
[39:06.15]Let's try this again.
[39:10.07]So I have to shoot up everybody as they run out.
[39:12.31]Nobody falls down, by the way.
[39:15.21]Just shoot in the door.
[39:20.08]Does anybody have any fucking idea what's happening?
[39:26.68]I don't have a single clue.
[39:29.99]All I know is everyone runs out.
[39:31.39]And apparently last time I just skipped video files.
[39:35.67]I don't get it.
[39:43.83]Let them all run out.
[39:44.59]That's what I did the last like two times and it didn't do anything.
[39:49.79]So let this guy run out first and shoot the guy behind him.
[39:55.08]I... What?
[39:59.66]I didn't shoot anything.
[40:01.36]You... Shoot the guys with guns.
[40:05.49]That's what I'm doing.
[40:08.53]I tried to shoot that guy like three times coming out first.
[40:13.15]He just, he shoots the ground with his gun and then it cuts to a guy shooting me in the face.
[40:16.60]Okay, here we go.
[40:24.72]I'm going to try to shoot him.
[40:27.94]Okay.
[40:31.38]That's what you have to do.
[40:39.78]This place is on fire, dude.
[40:41.03]What are you doing?
[40:43.23]Meet me in town.
[40:44.13]I am bad at handwriting.
[40:49.69]Look at this green screen.
[40:52.03]Oh, my God.
[40:59.76]Who is that random guy that didn't run out?
[41:05.66]I didn't have a chance, but it's okay.
[41:10.06]This is such a shitty house.
[41:17.11]Come on, where's Mad Dog?
[41:18.05]Where is he?
[41:18.43]Remember, Mad Dog wears a bulletproof vest.
[41:32.22]Come on!
[41:33.36]Here we go.
[41:33.74]Here we go.
[41:34.50]Just me and Mad Dog.
[41:35.38]You know what to do.
[41:36.68]Shoot him in the head.
[41:37.42]But I can't.
[41:37.74]They didn't mic this guy up properly.
[42:02.75]Huh?
[42:05.93]That guy didn't use... Alright.
[42:08.11]Anybody here?
[42:10.25]That's my turn, stranger!
[42:11.47]I don't have a mic!
[42:12.91]That's my turn, stranger!
[42:20.74]What the fuck?!
[42:25.08]I gotta shoot him, like, in the head, but I... I'll get him.
[42:31.47]Yeah, get over here, I know, yeah, yeah, it's my turn.
[42:39.82]That's my turn, stranger!
[42:44.36]God damn it, this is fucking so hard to do.
[42:49.28]You wouldn't believe how hard it is to fucking have the Wiimote get registered and then not have shaky ass hands to shoot him in the face.
[43:01.50]God.
[43:05.64]This is not like a typical light gun.
[43:07.74]It's like a dog shit Wevo.
[43:16.44]Let's go.
[43:18.03]Yell your dumb shit at me again.
[43:26.07]That's my turn, stranger.
[43:34.30]Get him!
[43:35.82]Again.
[43:36.96]Shoot him while he's down.
[43:37.60]Wait a minute.
[43:38.16]Oh, we heard a noise.
[43:39.04]Hold on a second.
[43:39.80]I heard a noise over there.
[44:05.83]The end.
[44:07.46]Yay.
[44:08.44]We did it.
[44:12.18]Everyone was just talking at once.
[44:14.32]And then they heard like a cat jump off a counter.
[44:17.64]And all of a sudden that means that he's gone.
[44:19.01]He's alive.
[44:25.05]JDE.
[44:25.75]Who cares?
[44:27.71]Not even on the top ten.
[44:31.58]Thank you so much, Joseph Sutton.
[44:34.65]Everyone thank Joseph Sutton for his extremely, extremely talented work.
[44:38.07]It's fantastic shit.
[44:41.05]On to Mad Dog 2, the last gotcha.
[44:46.65]Mad Dog 2.
[44:50.85]But before we do that, let me see if I missed anything here.
[44:56.51]Did not miss anything.
[44:57.29]I think we're up to date.
[44:59.43]So let's keep going.
[45:02.21]Mad Dog 2, The Lost Gold.
[45:05.41]We are not, we are just, we are deputy.
[45:07.81]Single player.
[45:08.39]I hope that prospector's back.
[45:09.61]There we are.
[45:13.56]Please have a good send.
[45:14.22]Yes.
[45:14.64]Hang on, stranger, and welcome aboard.
[45:17.94]We're going to do a little target practice here to get you started.
[45:20.44]Target practice.
[45:22.64]See if you can hit that dynamite.
[45:25.03]You blew that one.
[45:26.27]What?
[45:26.79]Shoot that skull.
[45:27.73]That's strong medicine.
[45:30.83]You missed it.
[45:32.13]Put a bullet in that sign.
[45:37.94]What if I don't... What if I just don't do anything?
[45:40.17]This guy's littered with arrows!
[45:41.03]There's so many arrows!
[45:41.69]This guy's so... That guy's more arrow than person.
[45:43.79]Seriously.
[45:44.43]This guy's fucking more arrow than human.
[45:46.55]My god, Jesus!
[46:09.74]There he is, this mad dog again.
[46:11.60]Oh, here we are.
[46:12.46]Come on.
[46:22.67]Alright.
[46:28.55]How long were you lying in there for?
[46:31.68]This dude hasn't even buttoned his pants up.
[46:37.92]Oh, here we go.
[46:38.38]Slow-mo.
[46:38.74]First slow-mo of the night.
[46:41.79]I was too busy looking at the slow-mo.
[46:44.91]That was a terrible slow-mo.
[46:48.50]Well, you got two lives left.
[46:54.52]I was too busy caring about the slow-motion that I just let it happen.
[46:58.61]There's the guy in the pig trough.
[46:59.69]There's the guy that shit his pants.
[47:02.77]Here comes the guy that goes through the baby gate.
[47:05.45]Oh, look at this baby gate!
[47:06.67]Ohhhhh!
[47:11.17]That guy up there, he's gonna roll down and go through the baby gate too.
[47:13.89]Come on.
[47:15.04]That's two babies down!
[47:21.58]Nice.
[47:24.24]Alright, that guy woke back up.
[47:28.67]Fantastic.
[47:30.51]What the fuck?! !
[47:37.25]Why?
[47:37.63]Why?
[47:38.23]That was not a good man.
[47:40.89]That wasn't a good man.
[47:44.61]That was a very bad man.
[47:49.68]That was a very bad person.
[48:02.90]You look honest, my friend.
[48:04.43]What?
[48:05.13]Find a treasure, return it to the mission, and receive your reward.
[48:09.57]In heaven.
[48:11.07]Choose your guide.
[48:12.53]This guy just tried to shoot me.
[48:13.87]Choose your guide.
[48:14.97]Oh, boy.
[48:15.47]Hold on a minute.
[48:15.95]We've got Shooting Beaver, Buckskin Bonnie, or the Professor.
[48:22.98]I don't know.
[48:23.56]I don't know.
[48:26.14]This is such a tough call.
[48:31.09]I think it's going to have to be the professor.
[48:33.19]Or maybe Bonnie.
[48:35.67]Hold on a second.
[48:37.45]We had some money coming.
[48:39.09]We're going to have to do a straw poll for this.
[48:40.83]We really are.
[48:42.55]This is too important of a decision.
[48:45.09]But Lucky Strike, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[48:48.48]And they say, you missed that one, try another.
[48:50.20]Well, thank you so much, dude.
[48:51.96]And Zshpi with $5.

[48:58.84]Who do you guys want my guide to be?
[49:03.38]Let's see.

[49:12.58]Alright, we got Shooting Beaver, Buck Skin Bonnie, and The Professor.
[49:27.79]Why does he not have a name?
[49:29.95]They all have, like, interesting names.

[50:07.62]Holy shit, this is close.
[50:11.04]This is too close to call.

[52:36.92]Wait, who just... Oh, it's that guy.
[52:42.86]Well, you got two lives left.
[52:45.26]Oh, whoops.
[52:46.44]Professor, you're a cheat.
[52:48.08]Gentlemen, I like to appeal you with alcoholism.
[52:51.78]Most man would.
[52:52.92]What are you coming for?
[52:56.21]Professor, you're a cheat.
[52:59.67]And a sweater.
[53:00.93]Wait a minute.
[53:01.87]Who's going to shoot next?
[53:04.87]This guy.
[53:06.11]Yep, this guy now.
[53:07.55]No, the bartender.
[53:09.31]Well, it's this guy.
[53:10.97]The guy playing blackjack by himself.
[53:13.43]And this guy.
[53:15.63]No, come on.
[53:19.54]Did I accidentally kill him?
[53:21.56]Gotta get that lady.
[53:22.26]This guy coming in.
[53:23.76]Nope, there he is.
[53:26.50]That guy just had, like, that guy just had stomach acid.
[53:29.32]That's all that was.
[53:29.99]He had heartburn.
[53:33.75]Oh, it's me, another naked guy.
[53:35.05]Ow!
[53:38.97]I figured I could probably do a better gig than that guy.
[53:44.17]Let me do that.
[53:44.93]And the Wiimote's not even getting registered right now.
[53:49.17]Like, what the fuck?
[53:51.27]I could do a better accent than that guy.
[53:52.91]Slow motion.
[54:08.85]Somebody find that guy in the credits.
[54:10.01]Bloody mad dog.
[54:13.15]He's robbing the train.
[54:14.31]What was the point of that last scene?
[54:19.07]They just added that in because they had extra footage.
[54:23.03]They were like, holy shit, Dave really fucked himself up on that fall.
[54:28.15]Use that somewhere.
[54:30.17]Choose your guide.
[54:31.25]Professor!
[54:34.56]Professor!
[54:36.73]I fucking love that so much.
[54:44.96]I wanna make one of these games.
[54:46.88]I really do.
[54:50.38]Don't you guys love how they all wait for each other to fall and die before their queue is up?
[54:57.53]This guy now, this guy waits.
[54:59.17]Here comes this person that she's been hiding there the whole time.
[55:02.97]Then this guy comes behind.
[55:03.97]Here comes the ne- Why are they always wearing these red jumpsuits?
[55:09.79]Is this what pajamas look like?
[55:11.07]Is this supposed to be, like, funny?
[55:14.00]Why is it taking this like a shitty Santa Claus?
[55:16.08]Strangers, you best get out of town.
[55:19.58]Mad Dog knows you've got the map.
[55:21.40]Call my friend.
[55:22.50]You have the map, and I bloody will have the way.
[55:26.54]A little traveling music, son.
[55:28.86]I don't want to shoot him so bad.
[55:31.35]Yeah, but what's the deal with the fact that, like, you're in, like, Santa pajamas?
[55:35.49]And that's supposed to be, like, you're naked.
[55:42.80]Okay, here we go.
[55:44.64]Don't shoot the conductor.
[55:45.60]Oh, God.
[55:51.40]I don't think I even shot that guy.
[55:55.34]Oh, don't!
[55:55.95]Ah, I shot her in the head!
[55:57.59]I got her right in the head, but the game didn't register it.
[55:59.25]We're fine.
[56:01.74]I got a cannon.
[56:03.38]Oh, come on.
[56:06.60]Come on now.
[56:07.36]Don't fucking do this to me.
[56:08.83]Shit, this is gonna be so hard.
[56:21.60]Ah, shot her in the head again.
[56:32.95]Okay, we're good.
[56:34.27]Alright, what were you saying, professor?
[56:41.70]I love how he's drinking out of like a bottle of Robitussin.
[56:58.41]Look at this guy.
[57:00.43]Alright, that guy didn't do his job all the way and he's too embarrassed to finish it.
[57:05.51]Think about it, right?
[57:06.47]He fell out that window and he's like, oh shit, I didn't go out all the way, but I just can't move.
[57:09.38]I'm supposed to be dead.
[57:14.04]God, the Screen Actors Guild is going to hear about this and I'm going to be in big trouble.
[57:17.76]Oh shit, I was supposed to roll all the way.
[57:19.80]Oh no, I hope they don't notice.
[57:28.29]What the?
[57:30.63]what choose your guy oh god damn it professor you're a cheat and a sweater I don't want to do this again professor you're a cheat and a sweater
[57:56.19]Ayayay, I don't want to do this shit again.
[57:59.03]Oh, God.
[58:02.42]Look at this roguelike.
[58:08.46]Oh, watch out.
[58:10.42]It's me, Santa Claus!
[58:16.83]Strangers, you best get out of town.
[58:18.99]I can't skip this.
[58:19.67]Mad Dog knows you've got the map.
[58:20.99]Call my friend.
[58:22.07]You have the map and I bloody will have the way.
[58:26.63]Alright, we're just gonna do the train again.
[58:33.39]No, we have to shoot the really good actor.
[58:36.65]There he goes.
[58:37.19]Alright, cool.
[58:41.07]Good job.
[58:41.57]Alright, here comes the train.
[58:44.53]Let's go.
[58:48.08]It's so hard to tell if I'm gonna be hitting these people.
[58:49.82]It really is.
[58:50.26]I don't even know.
[58:55.29]I shoot that lady every time.
[58:59.11]Every single time.
[59:03.92]Okay, here we go.
[59:07.28]We're within spitting distance of that treasure now.
[59:10.43]Okay, come on.
[59:15.41]I'm eternally grateful to you, friend.
[59:21.45]Just don't fuck this up.
[59:22.36]I think he shoots.
[59:23.40]What the fuck is going on?
[59:27.46]What the fuck, man?
[59:28.64]He wasn't even done talking.
[59:29.64]He wasn't even done with his cutscene.
[59:34.10]I'm so taken aback by that one.
[59:37.63]They threw that curveball at me.
[59:38.81]That was not fair.
[59:39.63]I think the guy shoots the little crack in the top left.
[59:43.11]After the guy in the bottom here.
[59:44.93]Guy comes out of the suitcase.
[59:45.95]That guy comes out of a fucking...
[59:49.46]Neil Goldman- God damn it!
[59:51.67]I was trying to make a stupid fucking joke about Fantastic Beasts!
[59:57.27]Don't make a Fantastic Beasts joke!
[60:00.65]You ran out of time.
[60:01.83]I couldn't think of his name.
[60:02.93]What's his name?
[60:04.37]Newt Scamata.
[60:06.31]When he comes out of the fucking magic suitcase.
[60:08.03]Okay, here we go.
[60:10.62]Right here.
[60:13.44]Flying fuck is what the fuck?
[60:16.38]Where is this guy?
[60:17.94]Where is this guy?
[60:18.91]I don't want to do this.
[60:19.71]We're doing a different one.
[60:20.75]Who do I shoot?
[60:39.09]What is going on?
[60:39.67]Oh, what the fuck?
[60:42.43]No, shoot the rope!
[60:43.57]Shoot the rope!
[60:47.46]Oh my god.
[60:55.40]I don't understand what's going on here.
[60:57.94]This guy comes up here.
[61:00.29]Then I have to shoot him again.
[61:01.45]And then shoot the rope or shoot him?
[61:07.20]I don't fucking understand what's happening here.
[61:09.68]I don't get it.
[61:12.48]So, I mean, like... I need to, like, shoot the rope, right?
[61:20.95]Here comes this long, dragged-out thing.
[61:24.61]Like, why can I not shoot that guy right now?
[61:28.67]And him.
[61:29.23]Got him.
[61:29.67]Okay, now what?
[61:32.71]Shooting Beaver holds you alive.
[61:35.01]I don't wanna hang out here.
[61:36.99]Come, we go.
[61:37.85]Alright, let's go.
[61:41.93]New place.
[61:42.45]That guy... That guy missed, but it's okay.
[61:49.36]That guy's still alive.
[61:50.02]That guy, did you see that guy turn his head?
[61:57.90]What the fuck is going on right now?
[62:00.36]Who's that guy with the gun?
[62:08.94]You going up?
[62:10.82]Choose your guy.
[62:11.66]Alright, Bonnie.
[62:15.94]Let's go, Bonnie.
[62:26.82]Wait, that was the guy?
[62:28.46]Wait, what?
[62:29.09]What are you talking about?
[62:30.79]Oh, no, he's got dynamite.
[62:37.07]She's like laughing.
[62:37.97]She's like, this is so stupid.
[62:40.33]Oh my god.
[62:45.13]Come on.
[62:49.77]I'm so just out of place right now.
[62:55.72]Yeah, wait.
[62:56.22]Remember, you have to wait till they get to their designated video edit point for you to shoot them.
[63:02.08]Here we go.
[63:19.26]By the way, can I just ask, what was that guy's plan?
[63:24.39]What was that guy's plan?
[63:26.79]He ran out with a lit dynamite, and he was just holding on to it.
[63:29.59]What was he doing with that?
[63:30.37]Did he have, like, a purpose where that was gonna blow up in, like, five seconds?
[63:41.56]What?
[63:43.34]That's the same guy that came out of the- that's the same God of Light guy.
[63:52.79]I love how they have like goofy guy does like a goofy face twice in a row.
[63:56.90]That's the same fucking guy.
[64:00.80]Another guy with dynamite!
[64:06.79]Like, what were you gonna do?
[64:09.00]What are these people going to do with their huge fuses?
[64:12.30]I don't even know what's happening.
[64:17.70]What the fuck?
[64:20.81]I have to pick the right person?
[64:22.81]This is gonna not go well at all.
[64:24.21]This guy all the way to the right.
[64:27.93]He's the most suspicious.
[64:36.28]choose your god damn it uh I want to see that but I want to see where that one was going and I just like I wasn't paying attention
[65:11.55]I don't have a plan here.
[65:15.45]I got a short fuse too, stranger.
[65:22.34]Next, next, next.
[65:25.30]We got to try to get through one at least.
[65:27.08]Got a light?
[65:29.96]So he dies right there.
[65:30.92]And then he does the same thing over here.
[65:33.35]Alright, we'll try the next one after this.
[65:43.28]There he goes.
[65:43.82]Here comes the funny comedy.
[65:45.08]He's gonna look cross-eyed into the camera.
[65:54.87]My Wiimote's not on screen.
[65:57.01]Oh my god, eat my fucking ass.
[65:58.77]That's so irritating.
[66:01.47]Like, legit, my Wiimote just wasn't on the screen.
[66:04.11]It wouldn't go on the fucking screen.
[66:06.95]I have one life now.
[66:08.27]Because of shitty technical bullshit.
[66:14.21]I'm so sick of seeing this guy's fucking face.
[66:19.22]This guy wakes up, yep.
[66:21.44]And the guy comes up with a lit dynamite.
[66:25.28]And it instantly explodes.
[66:26.48]Boom.
[66:27.72]That guy didn't even have time to throw that at me.
[66:33.97]That's what I don't understand.
[66:36.09]Even if he wanted to throw that, he would throw it and it would blow up in his face.
[66:38.67]Okay, here we go.
[66:41.35]It's the guy on the left.
[66:46.00]Come on.
[66:57.31]The lost bounty hunter.
[66:59.87]The last bounty hunter, actually.
[67:01.23]The last bounty hunter.
[67:04.25]Here we go.
[67:06.87]This is like a Civil War period.
[67:09.50]No, it's not.
[67:13.36]Huh?
[67:14.42]Well, this one has way more production value.
[67:20.60]See all this production value?
[67:23.54]I must have made, like, $20,000 on the last one.
[67:26.26]Am I doing this right?
[67:38.06]Here's the best.
[67:39.36]Here are the best bounty hunters in the world.
[67:40.73]DWF people.
[67:41.09]Alright, I gotta pick some outlaws and move on.
[68:06.74]Alright, we got Handsome Harry, El Loco, Cactus Kid, or Nasty Dan.
[68:13.20]I'm gonna go with Nasty Dan first.
[68:15.81]That guy was done with his drink.
[68:21.53]And the horse disappeared.
[68:27.09]Uh... Alright.
[68:34.14]This music does not fit.
[68:37.15]This is like goofy cartoon music.
[68:42.25]Don't forget to look for these.
[68:45.63]Look for what?
[68:47.31]Don't forget to look for what?
[68:49.77]Was that like an odd sexual innuendo?
[68:51.60]Don't forget to look for these.
[68:55.32]Like apparently, okay.
[68:59.46]And that guy has hands up, of course.
[69:06.02]You shot an innocent.
[69:08.04]I just may start bawling.
[69:10.00]Oh dear, that was awful.
[69:12.90]I always hated that trope, by the way.
[69:17.61]The, hey, I'm gonna just put my hands in the air and just don't kill me.
[69:26.13]By the way, I'm gonna come and I'm gonna spin in front of your camera.
[69:28.35]That's all I'm gonna do.
[69:35.90]That guy got actually fucked up.
[69:37.34]That guy wasn't even a bad guy.
[69:58.64]I know, they're just dead.
[70:01.69]Why was that guy taking a shit with dynamite?
[70:04.61]Why was that guy going to the bathroom with dynamite in his hand?
[70:09.59]That didn't make any... What?
[70:17.31]You know, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[70:19.29]Might as well take a lit dynamite and flick.
[70:21.90]I just...
[70:25.94]That wasn't an innocent man.
[70:27.12]He was just putting a gun in my face.
[70:30.88]It was this guy.
[70:36.04]Why would you walk in front of me?
[70:37.99]Why would you walk in front of a guy shooting a gun and just give me this dead face?
[70:45.57]God damn it.
[70:48.35]I can't tell you how busted up I am.
[70:53.90]No, please.
[70:54.76]We'll find him on the trail.
[70:55.79]Let's go get him.
[70:58.81]It's showtime.
[70:59.49]Let's get him.
[71:03.05]Forget about the trail.
[71:04.28]Let's get him.
[71:05.10]It's showtime.
[71:05.70]Let's get him.
[71:07.28]Now, this time, don't walk in front of my gun with your gun pointed.
[71:14.69]I'm like, see?
[71:16.05]Where's Dan?
[71:17.34]Bounty hunter.
[71:18.40]You couldn't even shoot this little cigar out of my hand.
[71:24.02]What the fuck?
[71:25.10]I don't... Everything has to be an explosion.
[71:29.58]Every single person has to have dynamite in their hand.
[71:33.52]Hey!
[71:34.44]I may be captured, but I can still be very, very nasty.
[71:43.23]Guess you was nastier than Nasty Dan.
[71:45.61]There you go.
[71:46.09]It's that easy.
[71:50.49]Okay.
[71:52.05]Uh, well, looks like we're going for a Handsome Harry.
[71:56.04]Handsome Harry, try the edge of town.
[71:59.00]Alright, thanks.
[72:01.14]Thanks for the info.
[72:05.57]That one, did you see that one?
[72:06.35]That one didn't even have a cut.
[72:07.13]That was seamless.
[72:11.72]So what, he's robbing the bank.
[72:12.76]Got it.
[72:14.90]Please have no- don't put your hands in the air, anybody.
[72:16.78]What the hell was that?
[72:18.04]I got shot in the complete wrong direction.
[72:23.71]Why would you jump up with your fucking hand?
[72:28.01]What?
[72:28.19]Uh... What the- who cares?
[72:41.29]Seven right or not, the house wins again.
[72:43.49]The house is crooked, sir.
[72:48.67]Nobody cares about that guy?
[72:49.85]Nobody cares about the roulette guy?
[72:53.21]I've gotta practice.
[72:54.41]You need to.
[72:56.74]Nobody cares about the fucking dealer?
[72:58.84]Seven right or not, the house wins again.
[73:01.06]The house is crooked, sir.
[73:05.34]I love it so much.
[73:07.24]Nobody cares about the fucking dealer.
[73:10.42]I love this guy in the front.
[73:11.24]He's like, holy shit, what's happening in here?
[73:12.84]There's a gunfight.
[73:19.01]Yeah, we were gonna remodel anyways.
[73:21.53]Huh?
[73:24.25]There's so many scene switches.
[73:27.79]It's hard to keep up with what's going on because they keep switching scenes.
[73:32.38]So fast.
[73:33.36]Did I get him?
[73:44.25]Oh, that's a big fall.
[73:45.31]That's a really big fall.
[73:51.15]All I can do is, like, laugh, guys.
[73:53.47]It's too hard to, like, I could, like, say, like, a joke or something.
[73:57.61]But these guys sound like orcs.
[74:00.70]These guys sound like fucking orcs.
[74:03.62]God damn it.
[74:07.10]Oh, these guys sound like fucking World of Warcraft characters.
[74:10.26]Ugh.
[74:16.79]It's so hard to aim.
[74:19.33]It's too hard to aim.
[74:20.69]God.
[74:21.59]I can't.
[74:23.60]Fuck.
[74:24.42]I'd be the last one.
[74:27.28]Thank God.
[74:29.82]Oh.
[74:33.42]Come on.
[74:34.90]Damn it.
[74:35.80]Come on.
[74:36.41]At least I can just start here.
[74:40.01]Oh.
[74:40.07]Oh.
[74:50.07]Okay, got him.
[75:08.89]Okay, that's gotta be it, right?
[75:13.57]I killed the mutant demon, good.
[75:18.19]Nice, good fall.
[75:19.19]No, wow.
[75:21.03]How are you staying up there, man?
[75:22.13]Fucking Spider-Man.
[75:24.58]That guy had a fucking problem.
[75:25.92]Hey, hey, hey.
[75:26.32]You don't want me.
[75:29.28]I'm unarmed.
[75:43.02]What?
[75:44.10]What?
[75:44.32]I don't even understand.
[75:50.51]That guy is just like the dope at me.
[76:01.94]This is just a laugh stream.
[76:04.84]This is seriously a fucking laugh stream.
[76:06.82]That guy was just Jim Carrey.
[76:12.41]Ow, my fucking face.
[76:14.69]My face is killing me right now.
[76:16.23]I have not, like, smiled this much in, like, fucking at least a few weeks.
[76:21.47]Oh, come on.
[76:23.17]Bullshit.
[76:25.28]Donnie Hunter, this mud's for you.
[76:27.58]What?
[76:31.84]What?
[76:34.70]That horse is fucking terrifying, dude.
[76:39.83]Dude, that's gonna be so hard to get those two guys.
[76:42.51]The Wiimote sucks a fucking ass.
[76:47.64]Let me try the guy on the right first.
[76:50.04]Okay, apparently, but it's... Oh my god.
[76:56.17]I'm in pain in the ass.
[77:03.91]There we go.
[77:12.61]Is that the guy from the first game?
[77:15.57]Really?
[77:17.46]You're not gonna help me out here?
[77:21.14]You're just gonna walk out casually with a watch in your hand?
[77:26.21]How is this a jailbreak?
[77:28.83]Why do these guys have guns behind the doors?
[77:33.13]These guys shouldn't have weapons.
[77:39.46]Oh, great.
[77:39.90]Not this shit again.
[77:41.36]Alright, I just killed one guy and they all fell down, so we're good.
[77:50.99]Is that just a fucking erection joke?
[77:55.57]What's with these, like, sex jokes?
[78:01.66]Where are we?
[78:02.24]Has anybody figured out, like, what the hell, what we're doing here?
[78:09.45]Okay, we're in the Wild West.
[78:10.65]We're in Chinatown in the Wild West.
[78:12.73]I'm so confused.
[78:13.67]Chinatown.
[78:15.21]Chinatown.
[78:18.27]In the Wild West.
[78:18.85]Okay.
[78:19.07]Good that we're coming to that understanding.
[78:40.44]Oh, the guy that fucking blends in with the wall.
[78:42.06]Great.
[78:44.46]Nice.
[78:45.56]Nice.
[78:46.60]He's alive still.
[78:49.52]Yeah, you're not gonna fool me.
[78:50.68]Nice for the fire walk.
[78:51.59]I need to shut three times.
[78:56.45]What the fuck is this?
[78:58.19]This doesn't make any sense.
[78:59.27]Are we not in Chinatown anymore?
[79:06.30]Okay, so we are not in Chinatown anymore.
[79:08.93]We have moved on.
[79:09.47]We're back in the Wild West.
[79:11.51]Nice.
[79:12.75]That was a really, really good stunt.
[79:14.29]The best stunt of the whole night.
[79:16.65]There's the coward deputy again.
[79:18.73]That was Owen Wilson.
[79:24.28]He's laughing.
[79:37.24]What?
[79:42.09]This is happening too fast.
[79:45.37]Do you see how fast this is happening?
[79:50.80]This shit is going on too quick.
[79:54.12]Like this guy fell into him and he's pissed off about it.
[79:56.40]He throws him over here.
[79:58.46]He's mad about something, and then he touches this person.
[80:00.84]Hey, don't touch her!
[80:01.92]Leave her alone!
[80:02.93]I'm gonna be a voice of re- No, I'm dead now!
[80:05.79]Take this shotgun!
[80:07.49]What the fuck is happening?
[80:08.41]Here, use this shotgun.
[80:11.39]What the fuck is going on?
[80:12.75]Like, why did- Oh my god, this is no primary.
[80:17.47]Oh my god.
[80:29.64]Imagine being a kid playing this.
[80:31.04]I know, really.

[80:34.54]Here, use this shotgun.
[80:35.84]Yeah, here's the shotgun.
[80:36.90]Now shoot this guy.
[80:38.10]And then this guy.
[80:39.08]And then this guy.
[80:40.22]Oh, that guy's gonna hurt himself.
[80:41.54]Who's next?
[80:42.24]I was winning that hand!
[80:44.54]He's gonna shoot me.
[80:48.20]He's gonna shoot me.
[80:49.52]Where?
[80:50.66]A guy on a chandelier!
[80:53.13]Really?
[80:53.41]You're gonna pull a guy on a chandelier joke on me right now?
[80:58.62]I guess so.
[81:04.94]They don't give you any time here to figure out what the fuck you're doing next, huh?
[81:09.44]This is like the longest one.

[86:11.73]You've got, like, you've, there's no, there is no reason why that happened.
[86:17.21]This, this part of the game is a piece of shit.
[86:20.53]Because this is like, I've done this so many times correctly.
[86:24.63]That's so stupid.
[86:25.73]Oh my god.
[86:30.67]Oh my fucking god.

[87:33.94]I have to kill- What the fuck?
[87:35.98]I missed my opportunity to- That was him, guys.
[87:40.60]That was the fucking guy!
[87:44.46]I am shocked right now.
[87:50.59]I can't believe we just saw him.
[87:52.31]And that's all we get.
[87:57.77]I can't believe that was put back in the holster guy.
[88:00.33]I need to see him again.
[88:01.85]I'm the kid.
[88:07.13]These are my toys.
[88:10.06]Let's play.
[88:15.46]Well, you got the kid.
[88:17.24]Here's your allowance.
[88:18.80]Oh, God.
[88:20.22]Okay, we have one more guy.
[88:23.35]That took so long.
[88:30.57]El Loco is the last one.
[88:46.81]I actually have to pee my pants.
[88:48.23]I'll be right back.
[88:48.79]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[88:51.03]I gotta use my new BRB screen.
[88:52.15]That's cool.
[88:53.15]PP time!
[92:23.29]Did I not loop it again?
[92:24.19]Oh my god, what a fucking idiot.
[92:27.19]Oh, shit.
[92:28.17]No, go back.
[92:28.83]What the hell is happening?
[92:34.80]I just, like, fucked it all up.
[92:39.34]Uh-oh.
[92:41.84]Oh, god.
[92:42.78]What did I do?
[92:43.14]Did the stream break?
[92:47.74]Are we still live?
[92:49.04]What have I done?
[92:51.34]Oh, okay.
[92:52.18]That was weird.
[92:56.49]Uh, alright.
[92:59.09]Ugh.
[93:01.01]You know when you have to pee real bad?
[93:03.43]And it ends up coming back and creeping up on you and then you pee for like 60 straight seconds?
[93:10.20]Alright, so let's get back into this.
[93:12.62]What were we doing?
[93:16.44]I can't shoot the gun.
[93:18.30]Why can I not shoot the gun?
[93:20.30]How did I not have bullets?
[93:21.54]I just hit continue again.
[93:28.43]Wait, that was the same guy!
[93:31.37]That was the- that same guy put his hands up!
[93:33.74]That wasn't an innocent man!
[93:35.08]That guy shot me with a gun, fell down, got back up, put his hands up.
[93:38.30]All of a sudden he's innocent.
[93:40.56]That's not fair, that doesn't make any sense.
[93:44.00]There he is, he flies down here and then does a Looney Tunes cartoon, don't shoot me.
[93:47.93]Apparently that's okay.
[93:52.80]That makes fucking sense.
[93:54.14]Oh, great.
[93:54.70]Not this shit again.
[93:55.88]I got threw up.
[93:58.48]I beat him.
[93:59.16]Who's left?
[94:02.92]Not again, yup.
[94:05.16]Okay, that guy's like, that guy's holding like a rug.
[94:10.53]Oh no, another bomb.
[94:15.31]Everything has to explode in this game.
[94:17.91]Everything.
[94:19.15]It doesn't matter what it is.
[94:19.90]They had a budget and they were gonna use it for sure.
[94:24.53]If you didn't think they were gonna use their budget, how would you have one guy in the corner?
[94:27.47]Have you?
[94:29.13]Do I have two guns?
[94:34.08]Why do I have two guns?
[94:52.74]Oh, come on.
[94:54.76]I feel like we're getting close.
[95:00.04]I guess I did it.
[95:02.04]Fucking hell.
[95:03.78]What?
[95:04.30]Wait.
[95:04.98]No, she was innocent.
[95:06.56]I think that was her that I shot, by the way.
[95:09.76]That was the same lady.
[95:11.74]Same exact person.
[95:18.04]You shot an innocent.
[95:18.91]It was me.
[95:29.91]Blue zone.
[95:30.33]Dude, it's always those sharpshooter ones that are hard to get.
[95:36.76]That was pretty good, though, I will say.
[95:38.06]And an invisible person in the window.
[95:40.00]Don't forget.
[95:42.24]Don't forget about the invisible guy in the window.
[95:45.06]That you have to memorize.
[95:45.86]That's how they got you.
[95:47.55]Back in the day, this was an arcade game.
[95:49.41]Like, from 20 fucking years ago.
[95:51.75]And, that's a, you know, I would have to put a quarter in right now.
[95:54.63]I'd have to put a coin in.
[95:59.26]I would be down like $65 if I was in the arcade.
[96:06.45]Who's next?
[96:08.43]That guy was still moving.
[96:14.85]Late for church.
[96:19.90]By the way, I love how I shot that guy with electricity bullets.
[96:23.44]That guy didn't know how to use a gun.
[96:25.42]Jesus Christ!
[96:27.85]These poor fucking horses, are you serious?
[96:31.75]Of course the Fru- ah, he didn't go through the table.
[96:41.70]That was bad planning.
[96:43.34]You see how that was sped up?
[96:45.70]Why did they speed that guy up?
[96:47.34]Apparently the editor didn't think he was going fast enough.
[96:52.64]That was the boss Oh shit, it's the train conductor
[97:21.70]This is the laughing guy again.
[97:22.82]I love how the gunshots are there and he's standing right in front of everybody.
[97:29.10]Like he had an opportunity just to get us all and he was just standing there menacingly.
[97:36.16]Oh shit.
[97:50.38]Uh... I... I can't... Oh my god, that was so stupid.
[98:11.80]That was... Why do they love me too?
[98:17.75]This is fucking so dumb.
[98:22.18]What are you doing back there?
[98:24.44]What are you doing back there?
[98:29.62]Why would you jump out like that?
[98:31.74]And why are they going in succession?
[98:34.04]Why are they doing this?
[98:35.20]Everybody just pull your gun out and shoot me at the same time.
[98:38.46]Why are they being dominoes?
[98:41.94]Ooh.
[98:43.10]Ow.
[98:44.48]Ouch.
[98:45.50]You got me.
[98:46.94]Ooh.
[98:48.40]No, that guy was a smart one.
[98:56.99]That's it.
[98:57.37]This is the worst gang I've ever come across in my life.
[99:01.49]Wait, that was Mad Dog McCree.
[99:02.79]That was Mad Dog.
[99:05.91]Oh, and there's like a random guy from Chinatown.
[99:08.76]That's here for some reason.
[99:13.36]What fucking wormhole did we go in?
[99:15.54]I don't ever recall seeing shooting that good.
[99:18.35]Anybody?
[99:20.85]You saved the territory.
[99:22.89]Thanks, bounty hunter.
[99:27.95]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[99:30.02]Boy.
[99:30.18]JDE, right?
[99:43.35]Number one, 3,500.
[99:48.15]Thank you, Joseph Sutton, for your, like, fucking fever dream of a game.
[99:57.98]What an absolute shitshow that was.
[100:02.14]That was, that's it.
[100:02.76]There are your three games.
[100:04.08]Yeah, that's it.
[100:15.46]That's it.
[100:17.96]There's your fucking American laser game, Mad Dog McCree, Gumslinger Pack.
[100:24.68]I hope you enjoyed it.
[100:26.31]Where was this, by the way?
[100:27.35]Is it Mark Hamill was in this?
[100:28.63]Is that what somebody just said?
[100:30.87]I'm handsome here.
[100:42.87]Hey, look at me.
[100:43.51]I don't know what happened.
[100:45.94]I'm way too good looking for jail.
[100:49.19]They call me Nasty Dad.
[100:51.55]I just didn't beat this one.
[100:56.30]I killed more than 50 bounty hunters just like you.
[100:58.84]Before I even knew it was against the law.
[101:01.52]Before I knew it was against the law.
[101:05.12]That was awesome.
[101:05.96]Get another American.
[101:07.73]I will.
[101:09.17]In this cantina, the tequila always comes with a little problem.
[101:13.45]Alright.
[101:15.73]Well, that's really all I had planned for tonight.
[101:17.49]I knew it was only going to take a couple of hours, but... I bought this on, like, Amazon, and I got it, like, shipped here as soon as possible.
[101:25.80]I think I want to do more American Laser games.
[101:28.40]These are just fucking perfect.
[101:31.83]And if they exist, and somehow I can play them, I will play them.
[101:36.09]That was fucking madness.
[101:38.89]Mark Hamill was you the whole time.
[101:45.35]Yeah, so tomorrow not tomorrow what we're gonna do on Thursday Thursday this was just like a quick fun like two-hour thing.
[101:53.70]I wanted to do it's all I really had planned for and on Thursday, we're probably gonna go back to Hollow Knight and I'm gonna try to get another one of these American laser games sent to me We'll go for like a good probably four hours four and a half hours five hours on Thursday because I want to play more Hollow Knight and
[102:15.36]And everyone's saying to play Spore.
[102:17.84]Spore, Spore, Spore.
[102:21.08]I could play Spore.
[102:21.62]If you guys really want me to play Spore, I will.
[102:26.59]And there's also movies.
[102:27.81]The movies as well.
[102:28.59]I have to do that again.
[102:30.09]There's a lot of shit that I'm going to be doing over the next couple of weeks.
[102:33.57]But this was just a little treat.
[102:38.86]Actually, I might stream tomorrow too.
[102:40.22]It depends.
[102:40.54]It depends.
[102:43.45]Spore, yeah.
[102:44.55]Maybe I will.
[102:45.79]I could give that a try.
[102:49.01]Yeah, the reason why that's all for tonight is because I have to stop the stream, essentially, and redo my whole desk to be able to play a PC game right now.
[103:02.37]So it's like a whole process for me to get all this shit out of the way and redo my stream settings to make it so it's not audio synced up the wrong way.
[103:10.32]So I have to turn my stream off.
[103:12.00]So we're just going to call it after a couple hours.
[103:15.86]And I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[103:19.39]Thursday will be, like I said, a good four or five hour stream.
[103:22.07]So have a good night, everybody.
[103:24.63]Thanks, everybody that stuck around.
[103:25.79]I hope you enjoyed it.
