[00:03.03]Hi.
[00:05.65]Hey.
[00:07.71]How you doing, guys?
[00:08.25]Ooh, drop it.
[00:11.36]Welcome to another live stream.
[00:16.24]Today's a hot day.
[00:20.15]It's been raining and thunderstorming around here, so... Obviously when it gets really hot, and then... Thunderstorms.
[00:28.22]All the heat gets into these tiny little poly... Polycules?
[00:32.62]Particle molecules.
[00:35.08]That turn into water vapor.
[00:37.60]And then they hang out around and they have like 100 degree water vapor particle droplets.
[00:43.47]And it gets really humid!
[00:44.31]And it gets unbearable!
[00:50.09]Yes, the emotes are here.
[00:51.61]All of them.
[00:52.23]All the new emotes are here.
[00:53.31]They're live on the channel.
[00:56.41]Free for you to use however you please.
[00:59.33]As long as they are respectful.
[01:03.77]I don't want to see any disrespect in this chat.
[01:06.71]I see disrespect here.
[01:08.95]We're turning around.
[01:09.65]And I'm taking this whole bus with like 5,000 of you.
[01:14.64]We're going back to school.
[01:16.42]You want to sit down?
[01:17.22]You want to sit in math class today?
[01:19.69]I'll do it.
[01:30.61]Going to school, but it's Sunday.
[01:33.47]That's right.
[01:35.05]Sunday school.
[01:41.59]Nobody wants to go to school on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:44.27]This is your time off.
[01:45.47]This is your time to shine.
[01:48.11]You get Saturday and Sunday off.
[01:50.90]We're going to the goddamn Grand Canyon!
[01:57.12]But anyways, today we're gonna play Blind Legend, which is a pretty interesting video game.
[02:03.17]I don't know anything about it.
[02:07.07]What a great start there.
[02:08.85]You know, it's a really, really cool, interesting game.
[02:10.79]I know nothing about this, so I'm speaking from total ignorance.
[02:16.44]It should be at least worthy of a try.
[02:21.24]The game has no visuals.
[02:22.88]It is audio only.
[02:25.03]The game is actually designed to be able to be played by somebody that is blind.
[02:30.71]So, it's on Steam.
[02:32.41]It's called Blind Legend.
[02:34.17]I figured that's a pretty cool idea.
[02:35.99]Let's see if we can play an audio only video game.
[02:40.69]And, what I didn't tell you also, we're on FaceCamp today.
[02:43.77]That's right.
[02:44.63]You get it once a year.
[02:48.24]Got a little problem here though.
[02:49.46]Mm-hmm got a little problem right there Now that's all I can see in the view in the rear view So he's a nice hair loser, I just I just had to take a cold shower it's fucking 10 trillion humidity degrees here I Didn't get a haircut.
[03:11.91]This is wet
[03:15.19]And I got one of these, look at this comb.
[03:17.31]This comb is a two comb in one.
[03:19.29]You see what I'm talking about here?
[03:21.19]Not only does it have, see those prongs?
[03:25.33]It's a small fine comb and then a wide comb.
[03:29.26]I leveled up my comb game.
[03:30.64]This got extra attributes now.
[03:34.32]Alright, so Blind Legend is currently in the background.
[03:41.60]IRL stream.
[03:42.56]This is not technically IRL because...
[03:45.58]I mean, it's a game, so I couldn't really go, oh, IRL category.
[03:49.10]Yes, I'm in there.
[03:50.08]It's not, technically.
[03:54.98]He ate the comb.

[03:57.10]Ha ha ha, he ate the comb.
[03:59.40]Want it back?
[04:03.36]Well, that just implied that I pissed it up, which has hurt a lot.
[04:07.45]No, I did like a magic trick and pulled it up.

[04:11.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[11:53.03]I'm a blind man.
[11:53.83]It's straight ahead.
[11:55.43]Why would you sprint away from me?
[11:58.10]Father, let's go.
[11:58.96]I know you're blind, but... Now I'll come over here.
[12:02.22]Watch out for the guy serving fucking pies.

[12:18.77]I'm getting anxiety.
[12:25.82]Oh, I'm done with the thing.
[12:37.27]I can't.
[12:38.13]Okay, I'm going.
[12:39.40]Whenever you hear this sound, an important scene is about to happen.
[12:46.47]What?
[12:49.59]What's that?
[12:50.17]It said me talking.
[12:51.51]Take her.

[12:57.79]Not them.
[12:58.43]Where is the cripple?

[13:01.22]In the name of Thorpe, speak or I'll cut you open.
[13:03.92]Please, I beg of you.
[13:05.30]Where is he?
[13:06.04]Find Blake.
[13:08.22]Lord Blake.
[13:10.01]They're looking for you.
[13:11.33]You cannot stay here.
[13:12.49]You must hide.
[13:14.33]Miss Louise, take your father to the courtyard.
[13:16.51]There are too many of them, Father.
[13:18.95]Come!
[13:20.36]Whenever you hear this sound, it's your turn to play.
[13:26.84]Over this way, over right.
[13:28.76]No, on your left.
[13:30.77]Straight ahead.
[13:32.51]Go.
[13:35.51]Just grab me and just pull me why would you do this?
[13:41.87]I feel like I'm just like smashing through a fucking cornfield
[14:06.52]Okay, I made it.
[14:14.16]Sir, we've got Blake's wife.
[14:16.65]Perfect.
[14:18.11]Lord Stilton.
[14:19.65]Bastards.
[14:20.55]Phil, release me or he'll kill you.
[14:23.43]Silence.
[14:25.77]Let's go.
[14:26.85]And the crippled boss, we'll get him later.
[14:29.49]The king is awaiting his prisoner.
[14:34.93]Dogs, I'll cut your throats one by one.
[14:37.85]Alright, now I'm just stuck here.
[14:43.82]Loading.
[14:50.92]Who's running?
[14:51.42]Sir Blake, my father has finished your sword.
[14:54.38]It's at the forge.
[14:55.96]Okay, I got a sword now.
[14:59.60]Where's the sword?
[15:00.42]Alright, thank you.
[15:00.98]Come on.
[15:05.77]No, I need this.
[15:06.71]I need this.
[15:07.15]Hold on a minute.
[15:07.71]I need to really immerse myself here.
[15:10.31]I'm putting on a... I'm putting on a sleep mask.
[15:15.38]I gotta be into this for real.
[15:17.50]Just wait a minute.
[15:22.16]Okay.
[15:30.01]This is much better, actually.
[15:31.39]I swear to God.
[15:34.40]Yeah, I can actually perceive what's going on now.
[15:36.35]Straight ahead.
[15:37.99]Straight ahead.
[15:39.01]Now come closer to me.
[15:40.69]You're close.
[15:41.77]You're close.
[15:42.73]Now come closer to me.
[15:46.47]This is like water.
[15:49.25]Are you in the shower?
[15:50.34]Straight ahead.
[15:53.18]It's straight ahead.
[15:54.00]It's straight ahead.
[15:55.10]Straight ahead.
[15:56.14]Now come closer to me.
[16:01.69]I walked by her and then backed up and then she took off.
[16:08.98]Your sword, Lord Blake.
[16:11.48]May she protect you from this mad king.
[16:14.28]Okay.
[16:14.72]To draw out or put away your sword, press X. X. Jesus Christ.
[16:19.78]You can't move with your sword in your hand.
[16:23.77]Your heartbeat reflects your health.
[16:26.27]The more you get hit, the faster it gets.
[16:28.91]Okay, I understand.
[16:30.59]Once the action is finished, Blake automatically puts away his sword.
[16:34.63]Okay.
[16:38.67]Bandits!
[16:39.89]The soldiers!
[16:40.86]They're coming back!
[16:41.94]Flee, my lord.
[16:43.10]Stay off the road.
[16:44.50]Thank you.
[16:46.66]Get your things, Louise.

[17:00.16]Where are we going, Father?
[17:01.74]We must cross the plain to reach the forest and enter into Thorc's kingdom.
[17:05.77]I gotta talk when that's happening.
[17:08.03]Hurry up.
[17:08.65]The storm is close.
[17:09.67]Let's go.

[21:24.48]Behind the waterfall.
[21:25.94]Follow me, Father.
[21:26.64]Follow the water.
[21:27.14]More to the right.
[21:33.40]Oh, shit.
[21:33.66]They're going to catch me.
[21:34.20]They're right behind us.
[21:35.32]Over here.
[21:36.50]This way.
[21:38.07]Straight ahead.
[21:38.91]Got it.
[21:45.41]Ooh!
[21:47.54]Turn around!
[21:55.30]What?
[21:55.68]On your left, you're closed.
[21:59.50]That's right.
[22:06.73]Sorry.
[22:06.89]Quiet, quiet.
[22:07.19]I feel like I must be experimented on.
[22:17.55]Let's go straight ahead What happened did she just lead me into a trap What is he doing he's just fucking with me
[22:42.27]I don't understand.
[22:43.49]Well, look here.
[22:44.23]A cripple and his brat.
[22:46.71]Keep moving, mercenaries.
[22:48.50]Gladly, I'll cripple.
[22:50.12]Hand over your cow first.
[22:52.04]No.
[22:52.60]I'm the girl.
[22:54.32]Let me go.
[22:55.60]Let her go, scum.
[22:57.00]Take it off.
[22:58.86]Why don't you come here?
[23:00.02]Let me slice you.
[23:02.50]During a fight, try to work out your enemy's position.
[23:05.40]Swing him out violently.
[23:10.96]or behind you.
[23:11.76]When he's about to strike, push the left joystick in his direction to strike him.
[23:19.13]Do not strike too soon or too late.
[23:21.85]Wait for the right moment.
[23:45.73]That's what I thought!
[23:47.05]Somebody's gonna die today, die today, die today.
[23:51.61]Somebody's gonna die today, and it isn't me, you ugly bastard.
[24:18.50]Let her go, scum!
[24:19.52]Get off of my daughter!
[24:20.58]Get out of here, scum!
[24:21.82]Get the fuck away from me!
[24:22.84]Don't let me see you around.
[24:26.36]Are you hurt?
[24:26.86]I don't even know why I have this thing in the corner.
[24:29.94]What is it?
[24:30.74]On the other side of the forest resides one of the seven guardians of Thorc's kingdom.
[24:35.39]They call him the Brain Eater.
[24:36.83]The Brain Eater?
[24:41.21]Yes.
[24:43.43]Oh, I couldn't... Okay, hold on a minute.
[24:45.17]How am I doing?
[24:48.91]How am I doing?
[24:56.91]Even the Burgah Boy technique works no matter what happens, you know?
[25:05.88]Surrounded by bandits.
[25:08.04]I can just imagine a guy fucking swinging a fucking sword around violently.
[25:14.54]Just swinging and killing everybody and winning.
[25:18.26]Oh.
[25:19.62]The game is a black screen.
[25:20.72]I don't even know why this is even on here.
[25:23.16]Like, should I just have this on?
[25:24.80]There's no reason for it to be there.
[25:26.55]That was fucking so dumb.
[25:34.63]Put it back?
[25:35.29]Why?
[25:35.65]It's like clouds.
[25:37.34]Why do you need that?
[25:39.90]You do know that every scenario, I'm going to wildly swing the fucking sword in a circle.
[25:48.64]Oh, they give me like a fireball so I can just throw it in circles.
[25:53.60]It flashes occasionally.
[25:55.99]So is it worth having there?
[25:57.91]Make it a little smaller.
[25:58.43]How about smaller?
[25:58.99]Like that.
[25:59.37]That's better.
[26:01.73]Turn the lights off.
[26:04.75]No, because then you won't be able to even... This indicates that I can't see.
[26:08.55]No, I'm not going to turn off the lights.
[26:12.68]It'll be pitch black in here.
[26:15.50]God, I'll do it for one round.
[26:19.92]I'm not wearing, like, any underwear, so, like, I'm not wearing any pants or anything.
[26:23.92]I'm naked from the fucking waist down, so hold on.
[26:35.27]Alright, let's try this again.
[26:41.98]This is, like, not even better.
[26:46.78]You can see the scan lines coming up my body.
[26:49.63]Alright, hold on.
[26:50.37]I gotta get back in.
[26:51.95]Alright, this is like putting on a reverse VR helmet.
[26:54.51]You realize that, right?
[26:56.65]Oh, I gotta go back in to the VR.
[26:59.15]Hold on.
[27:08.21]Is it better?
[27:08.61]Hey.
[27:13.14]That's like a surgical mask.
[27:14.86]Alright, here we go.
[27:16.64]There's no wasp in here.
[27:18.18]Don't you dare say that to me.
[27:22.20]Looks like I'm in a cave.
[27:24.74]Yeah, actually, before we go any further, I was going to set up an elaborate green screen for this game, but then I realized I was going to be the blind anyways.
[27:35.57]So how would I be able to change scenes and it just wasn't going to work if I was going to do this.
[27:43.65]There are no wasps on this stream.
[27:44.83]Not tonight.
[27:45.43]Alright, here we go.
[27:46.65]Back in it.
[27:52.01]Fuck, now I need to... Okay.
[27:55.05]Are we good?
[28:00.27]I don't have my... Why can't I... Hold on, let me put the video game in my ears.
[28:07.84]I'm sitting there going, why can't I do anything?
[28:14.99]This is irritating my skin.
[28:16.32]Fucking like, whatever this is, like an American Airlines sleep mask that I got like a year and a half ago.
[28:24.86]I don't fly American Airlines.
[28:26.08]I only fly JetBlue.
[28:27.44]Come on.
[28:29.54]Please.
[28:30.30]JetBlue.
[28:30.86]Only fly JetBlue.
[28:31.66]Don't fly any other airline.
[28:38.85]Alright, are we good?
[28:42.03]Here we go.
[28:49.76]You know, she's just... Come on, father.
[28:52.56]You're close.
[28:53.84]It's straight ahead.
[28:55.42]You're close.
[28:58.66]Straight ahead.
[28:59.58]Straight on.
[29:00.36]This is just GPS.
[29:04.36]At the motorway.
[29:06.08]At the motorway.
[29:07.08]Go straight on.
[29:08.53]You're really close.
[29:10.35]Imagine if... Is that a person?
[29:12.21]That's a goat.
[29:15.49]That's a goat from the video.
[29:19.29]I want to see the video.
[29:22.81]Where's the goat from the video?
[29:23.91]You're really close.
[29:25.36]I know.
[29:25.66]Let's go.
[29:30.16]Where are we, Father?
[29:32.16]I don't know.
[29:34.16]It's the Whispering Wood.
[29:36.66]The entrance to Thork's kingdom.
[29:40.43]Stay close to me, Louise, at all times.
[29:43.77]Look out!
[29:49.90]Louise, no!
[29:51.26]Come back!
[29:53.84]Where's the horse?
[30:02.92]Where are you?
[30:04.00]You can't just abandon me for a horse.
[30:07.34]Never disobey me again.
[30:08.82]Do you understand?
[30:09.73]I just was fucking afraid.
[30:13.19]Stay close to me this time.
[30:29.07]Okay.
[30:29.89]Oh, he bit me in the skin.
[30:38.52]Where is he?

[31:37.16]I can hear her over here.
[31:38.98]Wait, down?
[31:40.44]No, I don't think she's over that way.
[31:41.98]Straight ahead.
[31:42.80]I hear her.
[31:43.32]There she is.
[31:45.68]My god.
[31:46.40]I love this game.
[31:56.01]This game's already worth it.
[31:59.25]Where am I?
[31:59.63]Am I in a dream?
[32:00.95]Oh, we're on a horse.
[32:07.90]Wait, hold on.
[32:09.48]Am I running or am I on the horse?
[32:14.58]Who's walking?
[32:15.84]The horse is over here and I'm running.
[32:20.07]Are there three people with us?
[32:24.71]How come I don't get to go on the horse?
[32:40.84]Yeah?
[32:40.98]What are you waiting for?
[32:41.86]Oh, he hit me right in the face!
[33:10.31]I'm over here, come on!
[33:16.27]What?
[33:18.34]Why would you do that to a blind guy?
[33:24.54]You wouldn't say.
[33:25.16]You'd be the last guy.
[33:29.46]Huh?
[33:31.34]Don't announce yourself to me.
[33:37.04]Hey, I'm over here.
[33:38.26]By the way, I'm about to attack you, guy that can't see.
[33:40.64]Here I come.
[33:46.60]That's it.
[33:48.66]There are too many of them.
[33:49.83]Quick, Louise, get in the saddle.
[33:53.75]Loading.
[33:54.47]I'm over here.
[33:56.41]Just wait a second.
[33:57.93]Here I come.
[33:58.93]Guide me through the trees.
[34:00.89]Oh, God.
[34:01.82]To avoid obstacles, push the left joystick in the direction Louise points to.
[34:06.43]To jump, push the left joystick out.
[34:11.11]What?
[34:12.45]Oh, I got hit by a brick!
[34:17.32]Oh, shit!
[34:23.54]I wouldn't be on a horse!
[34:34.16]This is just an economy movie.
[34:35.56]It's gonna hit me right- oh!
[34:36.72]Faster!
[34:37.12]Faster!
[34:38.70]They're gaining on us!
[34:42.04]Right!
[34:42.44]Left!
[34:42.66]Right!
[34:42.92]Right!
[34:43.90]What am I doing?
[34:48.38]I fell off the horse!
[34:49.22]Father!
[34:49.66]No!
[35:05.19]Four trunks in a row.
[35:08.67]Loading.
[35:10.73]I get to buy four tree trunks.
[35:13.21]One, two.
[35:13.87]Guide me through the trees.
[35:16.78]To avoid obstacles, push the left joystick in the direction Louise points to.
[35:21.44]To jump, push the left joystick up.
[35:49.38]Where's jump?
[35:50.52]Right!
[35:50.94]Faster!
[35:53.50]Faster!
[35:54.90]How?
[35:55.10]They're gaining on us!
[35:56.46]Left!
[35:57.38]Left!
[36:00.79]Right!
[36:02.07]I don't even understand!
[36:03.29]Left!
[36:04.83]Why didn't you tell me about the one that was incoming?
[36:07.15]Look out!
[36:09.13]There's a ravine right ahead!
[36:10.57]What?
[36:11.36]Tell me when to jump!
[36:13.00]Now!
[36:13.16]Jump!
[36:36.46]I just did.
[36:37.38]Loading.
[36:39.80]Watch out, there's a ravine.
[36:41.40]Did I make it?
[36:42.82]I was like... Did I go down the ravine?
[36:46.75]Did I tumble down the ravine?
[36:48.17]Why can't the horse avoid this shit by itself?
[36:51.47]It's not an idiot.
[36:52.27]It can see the ravine.
[36:58.09]This is so much fun.
[37:00.13]This game's like $5.
[37:00.77]Where is that music coming from, father?
[37:05.21]Tell me what you see.
[37:09.21]We are on a bridge, surrounded by fog, and there is a deep ravine beneath us.
[37:16.11]I'm scared.
[37:18.15]Okay.
[37:18.73]Is there really no other way, Father?
[37:21.13]There!
[37:27.13]What?
[37:27.63]Across the bridge!
[37:28.55]Is there a troll here?
[37:30.75]Come closer!
[37:33.17]What?
[37:33.80]Go and hide, Louise.
[37:38.29]There's an ogre.
[37:39.67]He's to the right.
[37:43.15]What do I do?
[37:47.53]To protect yourself using your shield, push the right joystick down.
[37:52.12]You can repel an attack with your shield by quickly pushing the right joystick up just before being struck.
[37:58.71]If you succeed, the enemy will be destabilized and you can hit him several times in a row.
[38:04.16]Just like Darkwing.
[38:22.19]I don't think I'm doing it right.
[38:24.77]What's going on?
[38:27.39]Am I doing this wrong?
[38:56.63]I don't understand what's happening right now.
[39:00.89]I don't get it.
[39:08.76]Am I backwards?
[39:28.17]I mean, how do I parry?
[39:29.81]Alright, what was the parry thing again?
[39:34.57]I don't understand.
[39:38.99]It was up on the right stick, right?
[39:40.59]I'm backwards?
[39:48.27]Down on the right stick.
[39:55.87]I can't turn around, all I can do is swing.
[39:59.59]Look, ready?
[40:01.11]Ready, I'll do it again.
[40:06.39]Is he down, then up?
[40:15.68]He's a blind streamer, I know.
[40:18.12]I'm trying to figure it out.
[40:24.95]How am I reading shit?
[40:25.95]Alright, let's do this again.
[40:30.62]I was like talking over the tutorial.
[40:35.66]Alright, let's do it.
[40:40.50]Alright, here he is.
[40:41.21]Don't you cross my bridge, I'll kill you.
[40:48.21]Here he comes.
[40:50.09]Where is that music coming from, father?
[40:52.27]Wait, what?
[40:53.75]Tell me what you see.
[40:57.92]We are on a bridge surrounded by fog.
[41:01.40]By fog?
[41:01.84]And there is a deep ravine beneath us.
[41:03.88]Pull up.
[41:05.54]I'm scared.
[41:07.26]Is there really no other way, Father?
[41:09.41]No!
[41:10.43]Alright, the horse falls off into the ravine.
[41:13.33]There!
[41:16.17]Across the bridge!
[41:18.75]Come closer!
[41:21.71]Here we go.
[41:22.08]Miserable wretch!
[41:23.66]Go and hide, Louise.
[41:36.89]To protect yourself using your shield, push the right joystick down.
[41:41.39]You can repel an attack with your shield by quickly pushing the right joystick up just before being struck.
[41:47.98]If you succeed, the enemy will be destabilized and you can hit him several times in a row.
[42:04.63]Fuck you!
[42:05.29]Stab!
[42:05.53]Dead.
[42:06.69]Easy!
[42:32.39]The bridge.
[42:33.39]The bridge.
[42:34.09]The bridge is breaking.
[42:35.05]What do I do?
[42:36.65]What?
[42:36.89]Look out!
[42:44.20]Ah!
[42:44.76]Oh, I'm dead.
[42:46.98]Loading.
[42:51.32]With the lights off, all you can see is this top part, the bottom part of my face.
[42:54.36]Hello.
[43:05.94]Is that who's talking?
[43:06.84]Me?
[43:07.66]It's alright, father.
[43:10.04]Louise, where are we?
[43:13.98]And the brain eater?
[43:15.64]You killed him.
[43:17.44]These fishermen saved you.
[43:19.54]We have been in their village for two days.
[43:22.02]Two days?
[43:24.93]We have to get back on the road.
[43:27.47]We have to cross the ice mountains and the dry lands to reach the sea.
[43:31.99]It's the only chance to reach Thork Citadel without being seen.
[43:44.34]Ice mountains.
[43:47.51]Let's go.
[43:50.95]Don't abandon me.
[43:52.49]Are we in somebody's attic?
[43:55.17]I don't understand.
[43:56.82]It's a big attic.
[44:07.83]It's straight ahead.
[44:08.70]Straight ahead.
[44:12.50]Dragon!
[44:13.00]Ah!
[44:14.62]Dragon!
[44:17.08]Father, no!
[44:17.92]Dragon!
[44:18.26]It's too big and too dangerous!
[44:19.98]Dragon!
[44:21.96]These people saved me, Louise.
[44:24.33]What kind of man would I be to flee?
[44:26.53]Run and hide!
[44:27.47]Whoa!
[44:28.85]He's big.
[44:35.77]Ah!
[44:41.28]Where's the dragon, Louise?
[44:44.04]Louise?
[44:46.84]He's big.
[44:47.28]He's real big.
[44:52.78]Louise?
[44:54.35]Can you tell me where he is?
[44:55.47]He's as big as a building.
[44:56.31]I just need to know if he's behind me or if he's in front of me.
[45:02.83]Is he standing right next to me?
[45:05.49]He is.
[45:05.77]Alright, just don't move.
[45:18.23]I didn't get him, go.
[45:18.71]Alright, where is he?
[45:44.92]Come on then, B. Oh, father.
[45:51.05]To protect yourself using your shield, push the right joystick down.
[45:55.64]You can repel an attack with your shield by quickly pushing the right joystick up just before being struck.
[46:01.90]If you succeed, the enemy will be destabilized and you can hit him several times in a row.
[46:23.68]I'm just hiding.
[46:25.00]I'm hiding behind the shield.
[46:37.71]Where'd he go?
[46:54.51]Is he gone?
[46:59.93]If you hear your enemy breathing or calmly growling, it means he's watching you.
[47:04.88]Do not hit him right away or he will take advantage of your lack of balance to strike back.
[47:15.59]Whoa, hey!
[47:26.58]He fell in the water.
[47:28.40]Got him.
[47:28.71]Louise!
[47:30.91]I need you to tell me where to go now.
[47:32.83]And by the way, get that dragon's tail.
[47:34.75]It's gonna be worth a lot of money.
[47:36.47]This monster has slaughtered my people for many moons.
[47:39.91]Nobody has ever been able to defeat it.
[47:42.09]Who are you?
[47:44.63]My name is Edward Blake.
[47:45.85]Edward Blake.
[47:46.35]My knight.
[47:48.05]And this is Louise, my daughter.
[47:50.67]We must cross the kingdom to free my wife.
[47:53.47]Thorke is holding her captive.
[47:55.58]Oh shit, I know that guy.
[47:56.92]I wonder how... Beware the marauder.
[47:58.58]Okay.
[47:59.06]I'll be... We gotta keep going.
[48:01.84]I'm gonna beat this game.
[48:03.56]This game, it can't be more than like a couple hours, right?
[48:07.26]I'm gonna beat this whole damn game.
[48:08.84]Without dying once, by the way.
[48:35.43]Oh!
[48:36.83]Would have been great if I had that info before we got here.
[48:39.47]I'm just walking nonchalantly.
[48:40.95]Oh, by the way, we're on a fucking cliff.
[48:42.51]Could have told your father that.
[48:43.65]Careful!
[48:53.14]Father!
[48:53.54]Father!
[48:58.22]No!
[49:01.24]Put your hand back!
[49:03.26]And guide me!
[49:04.22]Don't just let me walk around, are you fucking crazy?
[49:07.22]Go put your arm back here, hook with me, and let me walk with you.
[49:14.53]If it's this much space, if we're hugging a wall cliff, what the fuck would you do that for?
[49:22.25]Just reach out your hand!
[49:23.33]Oh god, okay.
[49:29.64]I'm gonna walk straight off the cliff if she wouldn't tell me.
[49:31.86]Jesus Christ.
[49:33.52]Okay, careful.
[49:33.90]I gotta hit- when you can hit the- when the rocks fall.
[49:37.24]Don't you lie to me.
[49:41.32]Yup.
[50:01.43]Alright, let's go.
[50:07.69]She's trying to kill me.
[50:09.17]She was trying to kill me.
[50:12.89]She's trying to kill me.
[50:15.55]She just, alright.
[50:16.85]She just stood there and said, okay, a little to the right.
[50:19.41]Yep.
[50:19.67]She's standing on the edge of the cliff.
[50:21.24]Okay.
[50:21.90]Walk forward a little.
[50:22.82]Yeah.
[50:23.16]You're good.
[50:23.62]You're good.
[50:23.94]Walk forward.
[50:24.48]And then she pivoted this way, took a step back and said, keep going.
[50:26.92]You're fine.
[50:28.02]And I walked right off.
[50:30.24]I probably got a will worth like 40,000 gold coins.
[50:35.06]I'm apparently like one of the biggest knights.
[50:37.42]Most strong, intelligent, cunning knights in the whole world.
[50:41.20]I got a will worth like fucking 50 grand.
[50:45.93]Alright, I'm gonna do this much careful.
[50:50.85]Don't tell me it's straight!
[50:55.19]Alright, slow.
[51:04.62]Okay.
[51:09.28]Did I fall off?
[51:10.02]No.
[51:12.07]Don't.
[51:12.77]I'm standing on the edge looking down.
[51:15.25]Don't tell me to go closer.
[51:17.63]Okay.
[51:25.09]Is it though?
[51:25.96]Are you sure about that?

[53:03.71]Straight ahead.
[53:05.57]Straight ahead.
[53:07.54]Have we come to the conclusion here that we're no longer on the cliff?
[53:11.70]Because I don't know.
[53:12.98]I'm not 100% certain about this.
[53:16.14]It's straight ahead.
[53:17.52]Because I'm still acting like we're hugging a cliff.
[53:21.40]And if we're not, then I need to be... That info has to come into my brain.
[53:24.42]Go on, get closer.
[53:28.56]Straight ahead.

[53:37.36]Now, come closer to me.
[53:39.06]I don't know what we're looking at here.
[53:40.36]It's straight ahead.
[53:40.96]Let's go!
[53:45.98]Are we on the edge of a volcano?
[53:49.37]Straight ahead now, father.
[53:50.71]Now walk forward into the volcano top.
[53:52.83]I've really wanted to see what it looks like when a person falls and incinerates into a fucking tornado.
[53:57.79]Volcano.
[53:58.35]Straight ahead.
[54:00.59]Straight ahead.
[54:03.55]It's straight ahead.
[54:06.16]It's straight ahead.
[54:06.78]Father!
[54:10.80]The rocks above!
[54:12.42]They're falling!
[54:13.60]Hold on to me.
[54:14.72]To protect yourself, push the right joystick down.
[54:24.40]Okay, are you alright Louise?
[54:34.66]No father.
[54:36.09]I was so afraid Let's get out of here.
[54:38.69]Okay, the path is widening father this way
[54:43.36]Like, it just hits me right in the skull.
[54:45.70]I'm putting my hands up.
[54:47.07]Oh no, there are rocks falling!
[54:48.37]One just goes right down the middle, hits me square in the fucking skull cap.
[54:51.65]Die!
[54:52.85]Let's go!
[55:17.94]Let's go.
[55:20.00]Why is she echoing?
[55:29.92]Dogs.
[55:32.14]You guys can't do subs right now.
[55:42.63]I thought that was a dog.
[55:56.26]You can't cross, strangers, unless you have gold.
[55:59.58]Push him.
[56:01.14]Out of the way.
[56:02.64]Push him off the edge.
[56:04.70]Go to hell.
[56:08.61]Go, you great big ugly girl.
[56:15.50]I'm here, you blind bastard!
[56:22.82]What?
[56:23.04]I've lost my sword, can you help me find it?
[56:26.12]What?
[56:26.42]No you can't, cause you're blind!
[56:34.40]You got me brave knight!
[56:37.91]I'm dying!
[56:39.03]No I'm not, I'm fine!
[56:43.83]How do I push him?
[56:52.65]Come on, you son of a bitch.
[56:54.89]There's another one?
[56:55.57]If the enemy provokes you, it means he's trying to anger you.
[56:59.66]Do not hit him right away, or he will take advantage of your lack of balance to strike back.
[57:06.16]Ha, I'ma knock your head off.
[57:09.55]What?
[57:09.69]I'm gonna knock your head off.
[57:13.81]Come here, you.
[57:15.63]I'm gonna knock your head off.
[57:20.06]Come on.
[57:22.48]Come on, over here.
[57:24.06]I'm gonna gouge your eyes out with a knife.
[57:29.66]Are you?

[57:32.87]Come on.
[57:34.97]I'm gonna bust your teeth.

[58:04.19]I'm sorry.
[58:05.51]Come on here.
[58:07.51]I'm gonna bust your teeth.
[58:09.09]Come on over here.
[58:09.85]I'm gonna bust your teeth.
[58:14.86]He's just walking around in circles.
[58:16.78]I'm gonna bust your teeth, mate.
[58:18.08]I'm gonna bust your teeth.
[58:19.02]Hey, I'm over here.
[58:19.46]I'm gonna bust your teeth.
[58:21.38]Oh, my fucking god.
[58:24.98]Oh, no.
[58:27.38]Oh, no, no, no.
[58:33.00]Hold on a second.
[58:34.23]I got something to deal with.
[58:38.79]You don't understand how the game works?
[58:48.03]I have- my left stick is my weapon, and my right is my shield.
[58:51.73]And depending on where- I can go in a full axis 360 degrees around.
[58:56.66]Next week on Teeth Busters.
[59:01.30]That was fucking hilarious.
[59:04.93]God dammit.
[59:08.83]It's just so- Look at this- Look at the sweat building up on here.
[59:12.25]That ain't fucking- That- Look at that.
[59:14.27]That's like- Okay, I just did one of those things.
[59:16.45]You know, like the L'Oreal nose strips?
[59:19.64]So, I just did the close-up, microscopic, you just rip the nose strip off commercial.
[59:27.68]Come on, hit me.
[59:28.38]I'm gonna bust your cheek.
[59:31.90]Spider.
[59:35.14]It's dark in here.
[59:36.96]Spider's back.
[59:38.05]Right there.
[59:40.39]Is it a spider?
[59:41.77]I don't think that's a spider.
[59:43.37]No, I think that's like a piece of food.
[59:44.65]But pieces of food don't move.
[59:50.35]Come on, mate.
[59:51.00]Not when I have to put a thing on.
[59:52.20]Is that a spider?
[59:59.62]Is that a spider?
[60:10.28]I don't fucking know.
[60:12.84]I can just turn the light on.
[60:15.20]Why am I, like, horror movie sneaking in my areas?
[60:18.40]I just want to get him out of here.
[60:22.88]Get out of here.
[60:23.32]Leave me alone.
[60:25.90]Leave me the fuck alone.
[60:27.57]Leave me alone.
[60:30.45]Mate, I'm going to bust your teeth if you don't get the fuck out of here.
[60:34.37]Go.
[60:34.77]Run away.
[60:36.25]Be gone with you.
[60:36.95]Go.
[60:38.50]Be gone!
[60:38.92]There he goes.
[60:41.48]Alright, I'm staying back for this one.
[60:48.06]It's like Alan Wake.
[61:02.50]Oh shoot, watch out, a ghost!
[61:14.16]Where's my eye protector?
[61:16.70]Alright, so I gotta be prepared for this.
[61:18.02]Don't laugh.
[61:18.82]Fight him.
[61:19.28]And I gotta wipe this shit off.
[61:20.46]It's coming in sweat.
[61:24.08]You don't get it?
[61:24.46]You never played Alan Wake?
[61:25.88]You have a flashlight that looks just like that.
[61:27.78]You have to point it at people to kill them.
[61:34.81]This is scarier than when you had that rubber mask.
[61:37.99]But it's more immersive.
[61:41.29]Alright, this is the dry side.
[61:45.06]Here we go.
[61:45.82]Back in it.
[61:46.24]Is that on there right?
[61:52.87]It better be or I'm gonna fucking sue.
[61:57.39]This thing's really uncomfortable though.
[61:58.91]This thing's a piece of shit.
[61:59.89]Alright, here we go.
[62:03.44]Back to it.
[62:03.86]I'm gonna get it right.
[62:05.60]Here we go.
[62:09.12]It's straight ahead.
[62:16.26]Let's do it.
[62:17.50]It's straight ahead.
[62:19.08]It's straight ahead.
[62:20.30]Straight ahead.
[62:21.44]Straight ahead.
[62:22.12]Alright, here come the bandits.
[62:24.06]So, don't get provoked.
[62:25.02]Careful.
[62:25.68]We're walking on the cliff's edge.
[62:27.72]Oh, no.
[62:28.87]The path is getting narrower.
[62:30.83]No.
[62:30.95]God damn it.
[62:31.81]Straight ahead.
[62:32.49]It's straight ahead.

[63:04.91]You're close.
[63:05.89]Let's go.
[63:07.05]It's straight ahead.

[63:13.24]Let's go.
[63:14.08]Now, come closer to me.

[63:20.28]Now, come closer to me.
[63:22.21]Let's go.
[63:22.83]Do you want it left?
[63:24.67]Now, come closer.
[63:25.93]Straight ahead.
[63:28.75]Where do we go?
[63:29.83]Wolves.
[63:30.13]Father, the rocks above.
[63:31.65]They're falling.
[63:33.45]Hold on to me.
[63:34.59]To protect yourself, push the right joystick down.
[63:53.53]I was so afraid, Father.
[63:55.15]Alright, this time the wolves come.
[63:57.97]I gotta be be ready.
[63:58.45]I don't want to do this again.
[64:25.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[64:27.31]Okay, good.
[64:31.05]Okay, only got hit once
[64:52.02]You can't cross, strangers, unless you have gold.
[64:56.88]Out of the way, thief.
[65:02.03]Go to hell.
[65:04.35]Go, you great big ugly girl.
[65:08.65]I can block too.
[65:09.33]I'm going to try to... I'm over here, you blind bastard.
[65:15.73]Fuck off.
[65:17.11]Alright, I'm gonna try parry.
[65:18.25]Not this guy, the next
[65:45.06]I got that motherfucker.
[65:48.18]Where's his buddy?
[65:50.28]Come on, you son of a bitch .
[65:53.23]If the enemy provokes you, it means he's trying to anger you.
[65:57.33]Do not hit him right away, or he will take advantage of your lack of balance to strike back.
[66:02.59]I'll knock you right off.
[66:07.51]I'll knock you right off.
[66:11.86]Come here, you.
[66:15.93]Come here, you.

[66:38.93]Ahead.
[66:39.75]Dead.
[67:05.78]Hurry, Louise.
[67:07.26]The ice mountains are vast.
[67:09.04]We've hardly climbed the first hill.
[67:13.39]Alright, we're at the top of the mountain to get the sacred jewel
[67:50.01]No!
[67:50.21]I'm blocking.
[68:31.53]On the other side.
[68:37.64]Where is it?
[68:38.40]Stop!
[68:41.96]Are you alright, Louise?
[68:43.72]Yes, Father.
[68:44.36]It's just that...
[68:59.12]We'll never make it.
[69:00.43]We've been looking for days.
[69:02.75]Danger's all around us, and I'm so cold.
[69:07.77]I can't go on.
[69:08.95]I... Don't be brave, daughter.
[69:11.62]Think of your mother.
[69:13.02]She needs us, and I need you to be my eyes.
[69:16.36]But, Father... Shh.
[69:18.54]The Marauder's men.
[69:19.56]Oh, God damn it.
[69:20.24]I can't see them, but I can feel their presence.
[69:22.95]Hurry, Louise.
[69:23.47]We can't stay here.
[69:24.23]This way, Father.
[69:29.40]Go.
[69:29.70]Get away, get away, get away.
[69:30.94]God damn it, I walked by her.
[69:33.26]God damn it!
[69:43.79]Father, you're really close.
[69:45.57]Now, come closer to me.
[69:47.05]You're really close.
[69:48.47]Now, come closer to me.
[69:49.80]You're close.
[69:50.72]Now, come closer to me.
[69:51.92]Come on, Father.
[69:52.58]You're really close.
[69:54.02]You're really close.
[69:55.04]Let's go.
[69:55.94]You're really close.
[69:57.10]Now, come closer to me.
[69:58.34]You're really close.
[69:59.55]Really close.
[70:00.15]Straight ahead.
[70:01.13]This way, Father.
[70:03.65]Now, come closer to me.
[70:10.05]Just run with me.
[70:11.85]With my hand on your back or something.
[70:13.65]Jump off.
[70:15.33]I didn't tell you I could fly.
[70:16.79]Which way?
[70:17.67]Left or right?
[70:19.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[70:40.81]Go, go, go, go, go!
[70:42.03]Are they behind us?
[70:56.04]Thank God I got a checkpoint here.
[70:58.50]Fuck that place.
[71:01.10]All that walking around on the cliff face.
[71:06.38]Oh God, no more of this narrow passage.
[71:14.61]I don't want to follow her around on... Well, how would she know where to go?
[71:18.37]No, it's not!
[71:19.01]Oh my god.
[71:19.51]Now where?
[71:43.70]I can't wait.
[71:44.50]Can she go home?
[71:46.56]I'd rather do it myself.
[71:50.34]No, actually, that's not true, because then I would... I can see light.
[72:01.08]Straight ahead, still.
[72:03.51]Okay, I'm gonna listen.
[72:05.43]To the left.
[72:09.41]Keep going.
[72:13.53]Let's go!
[72:14.17]Ice!
[72:14.25]Okay, slowly then.
[72:15.37]Ah!
[72:43.96]Straight ahead.
[72:46.28]Let's go.
[72:47.68]Don't run so fast.
[72:48.49]Straight ahead.
[72:53.25]Eek.
[72:53.73]Straight ahead.
[72:59.31]Over here.
[73:00.97]Straight ahead.
[73:07.52]Straight ahead.
[73:09.64]Let's go.
[73:10.36]You're close.
[73:13.00]I'm just going to be very careful on this ice.
[73:16.93]I'm not going to get killed here.
[73:20.21]They're just doing that to fuck with me.
[73:22.45]It's not real.
[73:23.57]It's not real.
[73:24.21]It's not real.
[73:24.87]It's in my head.
[73:25.51]Oh, no!
[73:32.82]No!

[73:54.94]I made it.
[73:55.26]Okay, good.
[73:56.36]Straight ahead.
[73:57.96]It's straight on.
[73:59.02]Am I almost at the end of the game?
[74:01.34]This has got to be, there's probably like 15 minutes left in the game.
[74:24.52]don't follow the light don't we must keep heading East Louise the sea is just beyond the geyser of the dry lands 30 hours can you see the steam rising yes father come it's this way here we go let's get let's let's how much longer can I handle this this is like too much for my brain alright let's go
[74:52.01]Are we in thick snow?
[74:53.79]I think so.
[74:56.81]I love that sound, by the way.
[75:00.11]Stepping in fresh, thick snow is one of the most wonderful sounds in the world.
[75:07.07]Oh, I love it so much.
[75:07.99]Hold on, I gotta turn.
[75:18.84]I love it.
[75:20.38]I'm gonna miss that in Vegas.
[75:26.18]Did she just fall?
[75:28.64]Oh, I thought she just tripped and went face down in the snow.
[75:36.78]Alright, time for the... I hear something.
[75:40.97]Something's in here, around here with us.
[75:42.41]Yeah, I knew it.
[75:45.47]Bows?
[75:45.59]Oh, shit.
[75:46.09]They hit her!
[75:56.86]My leg!
[75:59.94]She's dead?
[76:04.54]Ow!
[76:10.89]How do I twerp?
[76:13.27]What am I supposed to do about this?
[76:15.15]Just hold the shield up?
[76:21.17]I can't walk.
[76:45.58]I can't move.
[76:47.42]I can't put my weapon away.
[76:56.21]I cannot put my weapon away.
[77:00.45]Just hold the block down.
[77:07.47]I'm just sitting here going like this.
[77:13.26]Attack them if they're using a- How?
[77:14.84]I don't have a bow.
[77:15.58]I'm like swinging.
[77:26.23]I can't run.
[77:26.79]There's no- I- Left's analog is swing.
[77:31.41]X is sheath, but I can't- It doesn't do anything.
[77:37.28]I have to reflect the arrows?
[77:43.38]No, that's not working.
[77:50.76]Hold on, what are you guys saying?
[77:56.73]Slice the arrows.
[78:05.96]I guess I have to fruit ninja the arrows.
[78:11.55]You have to fruit ninja the arrows and probably piss him off about how much of a Jedi you are.
[78:19.33]Just walk.
[78:19.83]I can't walk.
[78:21.67]When your weapon comes out, left analog turns into weapon, swinging the sword.
[78:26.09]And I'm supposed to be with Lashitha with X, but I can't put it away.
[78:28.50]I don't know why.
[78:30.82]We must keep heading east, Louise.
[78:33.60]The sea is just beyond the geyser of the dry lands.
[78:37.20]Can you see the steam rising?
[78:39.56]Eat the daughter.
[78:40.27]I can't when I'm getting shot at with arrows.
[78:41.89]Oh, man.
[78:47.71]Head weast.
[78:50.87]You have to hold your mouth open and yell, shoot here.
[78:59.90]Alright.
[79:00.92]I'm going to try slicing the arrows.
[79:06.50]I'm trying to catch it.
[79:07.91]Okay, see?
[79:08.33]See what I'm talking about?
[79:09.37]So I just pulled out my weapon.
[79:11.67]So now this swings, but that cheats it.
[79:15.51]I think when you're in combat, you just have to stay in combat.
[79:17.93]You can't leave.
[79:18.43]Is this the ice thing again?
[79:20.39]No, I don't think so.
[79:23.07]Now here come the arrows.
[79:26.39]Alright, let's do it.
[79:28.19]Let's do it.
[79:28.63]Alright, where are they?
[79:32.83]Let me try to fruit ninja.
[79:43.35]Here we go.
[79:45.99]The marauder's men.
[79:47.29]Quick.
[79:47.95]They found us.
[79:48.93]They've got both.
[79:50.47]Take shelter, Louise.
[79:51.89]Hurry.
[79:54.60]No, I... My leg, father.
[79:57.38]They got me.
[79:58.82]I... Louise.
[80:09.59]I got it.
[80:24.23]Louise, answer me.
[80:25.09]What the fuck?
[80:33.95]Whoa!
[80:46.02]What was that?
[80:47.34]Ah!
[81:23.80]in the air.
[81:27.34]Got it.
[81:38.09]Got it again.
[81:41.87]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[81:44.63]Punch!
[81:45.07]Uh-oh, wait.
[81:45.89]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:47.19]What have your men done to my daughter, Marauder?
[81:53.97]You will pay for their crime.
[81:57.41]What?
[82:07.11]Harry.
[82:09.80]Over here.
[82:29.09]Stop turning him into fucking sushi!
[82:45.20]He's right in front.
[83:12.93]I got him.
[83:15.17]Luis.
[83:16.36]Yeah, that was hard.
[83:17.12]Luis.
[83:21.02]Loading.
[83:22.70]Congratulations.
[83:23.55]Now you need to find the cure for the poison that's infiltrating your daughter's leg from the arrow.
[83:36.29]Where am I?
[83:36.63]Hold on to me, Louise.
[83:37.49]I recognize those chants.
[83:39.77]They're coming from the Highland monks.
[83:41.64]They will help us.
[83:42.44]Okay, the monks.
[83:43.16]It's so cold, Father.
[83:44.88]Hold on.
[83:45.88]We're almost there.
[83:46.64]We gotta follow the bells.
[83:59.49]Uh, I... Uh, Dad.
[84:02.69]Dad, you're not going the right way.
[84:05.80]You're running into a carnival.
[84:11.58]You just walked by a sign that said, guaranteed to die.
[84:14.94]Turn around, dad.
[84:15.66]What was that?
[84:33.78]Somebody's with her.
[84:34.46]Somebody's here.
[84:40.08]Follow the bell.
[84:45.70]Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
[84:47.56]I need to be able to hear.
[84:48.28]Stop it.
[84:48.90]Quiet.
[84:50.20]I need to be able to hear.
[84:51.67]Shut up.
[84:52.17]I need to be able to hear the bell.
[84:52.99]Look, you're going to be fine.
[84:57.03]Thank you.
[85:06.06]There it is again.
[85:32.43]Ah, you fucker!
[85:33.97]Where is he?
[85:41.97]To the left.
[85:43.40]Is he in front of me?
[85:51.46]Yes he is, okay.
[85:55.51]Ah, you fucking asshole!
[86:08.05]No, I want to do this again Loading He was over here and I just wasn't timing it right apparently I
[86:32.90]Shit.
[86:33.60]They sure are.
[86:36.68]No, Blaine.
[86:43.77]It's all hard for me to even talk.
[86:45.53]I'm getting speech jammed right now.
[86:50.19]Can you turn off the graphics?
[86:53.54]That's all there is for graphics.
[86:57.52]Alright, I need to be able to concentrate with my eyes open for this one.
[87:06.10]Turn on... There are no subtitles.
[87:11.30]So I turn this... This is too much?
[87:15.06]Well, this is just like an indicator if I'm getting hit or not, so... I'll make it small.
[87:22.18]I need FOV slider on higher.
[87:24.61]Alright, let's follow this.
[87:29.29]Subtitles for a game that has no... You can't even see.
[87:34.03]Oh, there he is!
[87:40.53]This is actually harder to do with my eyes open.
[87:57.31]It's harder to do like this.
[88:05.77]How am I not hitting him?
[88:06.97]I don't understand.
[88:23.80]What the fuck?
[88:25.26]How is that not hitting him?
[88:31.42]The same thing happened last time with this guy on the left.
[88:43.28]Did I get him?
[88:48.10]What the fuck?
[88:48.72]Okay.
[89:10.92]Custom HUD?
[89:12.18]No, that's not a custom HUD.
[89:13.39]That's the only HUD.
[89:15.07]Okay, let's go.
[89:16.83]The dogs are annoying.
[89:21.61]Drop in frame?
[89:22.49]I haven't dropped one frame this whole night.
[89:25.68]What do you want about... Put on mono audio?
[89:31.26]No!
[89:36.44]The game would be unplayable.
[89:45.75]This whole game is based around stereo.
[89:56.07]Somebody sprinted by me.
[89:57.88]Somebody T-1000'd right by me.
[90:07.14]Made it.
[90:10.00]Somebody was just full stride.
[90:11.81]Help!
[90:12.57]Open the door!
[90:15.20]Take it, he's gonna open it and I'm gonna knock into his face.
[90:21.93]Get in!
[90:22.23]Is he gonna open the door?
[90:23.23]Hello!
[90:23.41]Ow, my mouth!
[90:44.98]I told you.
[90:46.46]This guy's gonna say, is he now gonna be like, over here!
[90:52.84]Come!
[90:53.28]You're close!
[90:54.34]Let's go!
[90:59.76]He's taking up the same, uh, the same torch.
[91:02.80]He's running away too.
[91:10.80]Why does everybody treat the blind in this game the same way?
[91:15.10]Whispering and then running away, whispering and then running away, and then saying, hey, run straight.
[91:19.30]I'm right in front of you.
[91:20.56]Hurry up.
[91:21.26]A few steps more.
[91:22.92]Let's keep going.
[91:23.74]What if he's just leading me into a cage or something?
[91:26.57]That's very possible, isn't it?
[91:28.39]Go straight ahead.
[91:29.11]You're going to hear the door slam, and I'm going to be inside of like a box.
[91:33.21]Over here.
[91:33.47]We're almost there.
[91:41.09]King Thor?
[91:44.66]Hey!
[91:44.82]Hey!
[91:44.94]Hey!
[91:45.04]Did I die?
[91:46.10]They got me.
[92:08.97]You guys wanted me to play this on hardcore mode?
[92:11.89]I just hope we're inside of the cathedral or wherever the fuck we are.
[92:15.79]Alright, good, good, good.
[92:25.92]Over here!
[93:01.62]Here we go.
[93:02.04]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[93:09.14]So they're running around and they taunt you.
[93:11.00]They don't swing yet, but it's hard to determine what they're even doing.
[93:13.40]It's right in front of me.
[93:21.33]There's three of them.
[93:37.66]You ugly so-and-so.
[93:39.08]I'm gonna get you!
[93:39.98]Okay, the beginning there was hard because there were three people swinging at the same time.
[94:11.70]Got him right in the neck.
[94:13.17]Right in the neck.
[94:13.79]This part right here.
[94:14.57]Whoa!
[94:16.03]Whoa!
[94:16.59]I gotta parry him.
[94:53.97]Front.
[94:55.81]Shit.
[94:56.67]This guy's fucking hard.
[95:14.29]Fuck you!
[95:30.87]Next time, Lord Stilton, I will kill you.
[95:33.91]Tell Thorke I'm on my way.
[95:35.77]And if he has touched one hair on my wife's head, I'll cut his throat.
[95:41.61]Yikes.
[95:43.06]He knows what I can do.
[95:46.34]That guy was swinging more than once.
[95:47.94]That was kind of insane.
[95:53.02]Louise.
[95:54.82]Lord Thor.
[95:57.04]Lord Shrek.
[95:57.88]I can't stop the poison.
[96:01.18]And by dawn, it will have reached her heart.
[96:05.23]You ugly so-and-so.
[96:06.31]Oh, there's a demon.
[96:07.09]That's not the bad ending.
[96:08.01]What are you talking about?
[96:09.63]No, I got one person behind me making noise, one person in front of me.
[96:13.43]This is gonna get too much.
[96:39.00]This is pretty cool so far, though.
[96:42.50]Interesting concept.
[96:45.37]Oh, hold on.
[96:45.97]I gotta do this.
[96:49.17]Turn this up.
[96:53.41]That's better, right?
[96:54.77]Is that better?
[96:57.15]You guys need it louder?
[96:58.16]Probably a little bit louder, right?
[97:01.70]I think that's good.
[97:06.74]Alright, here we go.
[97:13.42]Okay.
[97:13.86]Go straight ahead.
[97:18.54]I'm right in front of you.
[97:19.94]I'm right in front of you.
[97:22.92]I'm right in front of a few steps more.
[97:25.14]Over here.
[97:25.74]Over here.
[97:26.82]Over here.
[97:27.46]Turn around.
[97:27.98]Turn around.
[97:28.58]I'm behind you.
[97:29.52]Turn right.
[97:30.32]Over here.
[97:31.10]I'm right in front of you.
[97:32.60]Follow me, knight.
[97:35.24]On your left.
[97:35.76]Can't you just put me in a goddamn wagon and just push me?
[97:40.75]You know, it gets to a point where just put me in a wheelbarrow and just fucking... Just Brandon Stark me.
[97:47.73]Go on.
[97:49.09]Get closer.
[97:50.83]Go on.
[97:51.73]Get closer.
[97:52.77]Go on.
[97:53.99]Hurry up.
[97:55.39]Hurry up.
[97:56.73]It's a few steps more.
[97:58.83]We're almost there.
[97:59.87]Good.
[98:01.79]Hurry up.
[98:03.12]It's straight ahead.
[98:03.92]Good.
[98:05.18]Go on.
[98:05.92]Get closer.
[98:07.38]Go on.
[98:08.12]Get closer.
[98:08.96]Over here.
[98:12.43]Alright, we're at the witch's hut.
[98:17.51]A few steps more.
[98:18.97]Do you hear that?
[98:21.64]It is the enchanting mists.
[98:24.28]The enchanting mists.
[98:26.24]Don't breathe it in.
[98:28.14]I dare not venture any further.
[98:30.60]What?
[98:30.80]Follow the song through the forest.
[98:33.54]It will guide you to her lair.
[98:36.04]Oh, God.
[98:37.36]Okay.
[98:38.78]Thanks for nothing.
[98:39.60]May the gods protect you, knight.
[98:43.51]Hang on to me, Louise.
[98:45.71]We're going to find the demon.
[98:47.57]Okay.
[98:49.03]Follow the song.
[98:52.44]He's running real far over there.
[98:55.96]What if I... I'm listening for the song.
[99:01.78]I hear rustling.
[99:10.04]More fucking rustling leaves.
[99:15.85]Gotta go this way.
[99:16.47]It's in front of us, right?
[99:20.15]I'm walking towards the groaning frog sound.
[99:24.03]Whoa, whoa.
[99:26.95]What the fuck was that?
[99:29.19]Disco.
[99:30.01]It's over here.
[99:36.78]More bugs and animals.
[99:42.10]Getting closer, it's getting louder.
[99:45.08]Fucking snake.
[99:45.88]Who are you?
[99:46.30]Are you the demon?
[99:48.29]Nope, I am an animal.
[100:29.57]Is he on the right side?
[100:30.19]I'm about to die.
[100:38.41]Is he dead?
[100:44.74]Jesus Christ.
[100:49.74]It's getting a lot harder to tell when they're even moving.
[100:54.10]He goes like...
[100:57.58]Jesus god loading Dark Souls asmr I'm trying to parry we're not very far now my lord it's very loud I'll turn it down go straight ahead go straight ahead a few steps over here skyrim alexa over here go straight ahead go on go on
[101:25.91]Turn the lights on, you look ridiculous.
[101:29.02]Wasn't that the point?
[101:32.32]Wait, so this is a game?
[101:35.26]Yeah, I'm playing this game.
[101:37.02]I'm literally moving around in the game.
[101:40.38]And the only indicator that you have is they make a bunch of noise and then they hit you.
[101:44.74]And you have to block it or hit them before they swing.
[101:47.94]Please stop playing the game.
[101:52.02]No.
[101:53.82]I'm having a good time.
[101:57.33]I'm enjoying myself right now, duty.
[102:00.43]Okay.
[102:03.12]You look like a burglar that just went to the gym.
[102:10.56]I'm coming in to steal your trinkets.
[102:11.90]Good.
[102:12.00]Okay.
[102:12.26]Okay.
[102:25.38]Just call us ugly so-and-sos.
[102:27.58]Alright.
[102:32.34]So... There's like this fucking crazy demon thing, whatever, like it's a bird monster.
[102:39.13]Shows up right here.
[102:46.93]This guy is weird because he swings twice, but sometimes he doesn't swing at all when he growls.
[102:52.45]Just a question of trying to catch him right before he hits you.
[103:07.19]I'm not gonna try to parry this guy.
[103:08.37]I'm gonna block and listen for patterns, and I'm gonna try to swing right before he swings, but that's so hard to do.
[103:13.59]Damn.
[103:16.81]Alright, here we go.
[103:21.07]Okay, block.
[103:26.91]Large growl.
[103:29.91]Alright, so that's when he swings.
[103:38.45]So right in the middle of that is when I swing.
[103:42.98]Okay.
[103:48.24]That D did something completely different.
[103:50.36]I'll parry this.
[103:59.06]Shield up.
[104:05.22]Block, block, block, block.
[104:11.47]Hold on.
[104:16.67]Over here.
[104:21.79]See how he counter attacks.
[104:26.31]Right in front.
[104:34.43]See?
[104:35.62]He does it twice.
[104:45.77]It's gone?
[104:46.91]Alright, we got it.
[104:50.00]Stay with me, please!
[104:53.26]Here come the songs.
[104:55.96]The only way you can stop your daughter from dying from the poison is you need to drink this weird liquid and go on a journey and find it.
[105:05.51]There we go.
[105:20.79]Am I in front of her house?
[105:22.01]Am I walking around her?
[105:23.03]Am I, like, casing this lady's house?
[105:25.57]I think I just got bit by a mosquito on my shoulder.
[105:32.49]I gotta laugh so hard if this thing starts telling me this way.
[105:36.93]Are we going underwater?
[105:42.62]Why am I in the water?
[105:43.66]It's over here.
[105:52.19]straight ahead shit more monsters straight ahead I don't know there's too many sounds like them when daredevil when Ben Affleck somebody like made a loud noise
[106:23.40]I think it's behind me.
[106:24.15]Is it to my left?
[106:28.41]I think it's right in front of me.
[106:35.95]Yep.
[106:36.13]Alright.
[106:36.64]God, don't die here.
[106:37.58]Did I not find it?
[106:54.66]It's going to be alright, Louise.
[106:55.70]The demon will help us.
[106:57.06]I'm so lost.
[106:58.09]Oh, shit.
[106:58.61]Okay, there she is.
[106:59.75]Who dares to sully the land of my ancestors?
[107:02.41]I have not come to.
[107:03.17]Your presence is a disgrace.
[107:04.89]You must die.
[107:06.03]No!
[107:07.39]Whoa!
[107:07.79]What?
[107:10.30]What?
[107:23.12]What the fuck is she... What?
[107:24.48]Hold on, I gotta listen for this.
[107:25.94]She goes... Alright, so she has two sounds.
[107:30.83]She goes... Okay, so it's after that one.
[107:39.26]That didn't work.
[107:40.20]Hold on.
[107:43.60]Can I not parry her?
[107:44.32]Wait, what the fuck?
[107:47.78]Oh, she's shooting fireballs.
[107:50.20]She's shooting fucking fireballs.
[107:52.06]She doesn't have a weapon.
[107:53.98]She's throwing fireballs.
[107:56.50]Oh, I'm sitting here trying to, like, fucking parry her.
[108:00.44]Oh, god damn it.
[108:09.10]I got a bite?
[108:12.64]Something came after me.
[108:15.96]Yeah.
[108:16.62]She was standing... Oh my god.
[108:18.58]I don't want to do this whole fucking thing again.
[108:30.31]Shit.
[108:34.81]Looks like claw marks.
[108:35.89]I just like... Yeah.
[108:37.46]Why am I like infected right now?
[108:40.96]Alright.
[108:41.68]I'm going to try this one more time.
[108:47.55]That's a zit.
[108:49.33]That's a zit.
[108:50.87]When it's dark, it's much easier to see it.
[108:53.87]I'm turning into a zombie.
[108:56.94]Yeah, I don't know.
[108:57.54]I guess I've got some sensitivity problems.
[109:01.58]Dirty fingernails.
[109:02.52]I don't have dirty fingernails.
[109:05.30]What are you talking about?
[109:07.38]Yeah, very clean.
[109:10.82]Oh, I see what you mean.
[109:12.05]Dirty as in, like, I just got, like, a cat scratch and infected myself.
[109:20.41]I understand that now.
[109:21.33]Now I get what you were saying.
[109:23.01]Okay.
[109:24.59]Alright, let's go.
[109:33.27]I'm gonna try this again.
[109:34.31]So, if... How do you stop a fireball?
[109:37.89]I'm just gonna have to block it?
[109:39.07]Or just swing at her?
[109:40.07]I don't know.
[109:40.85]What's the game plan here?
[109:41.95]Shave that weak mustache.
[109:48.90]I don't have any facial hair here.
[109:49.96]You're looking at my weird shapes on my face.
[109:52.84]Look.
[109:56.55]That's just the weirdly shaped fucking face that I have, dude.
[110:00.43]I don't have a mustache.
[110:02.65]That's like my nasolabial folds.
[110:11.98]My pimple is too distracting.
[110:14.74]Deal with it.
[110:24.21]Yeah, my nasal labial fold.
[110:25.73]That's what those are called.
[110:26.85]Go straight ahead.
[110:29.47]Do you hear that?
[110:32.14]It is the... I'm not going to put a circle over it.
[110:36.42]Give me a break, guys.
[110:38.64]I dare not venture any further.
[110:40.10]There.
[110:40.46]Is that better for you guys?
[110:42.58]Through the forest.
[110:44.04]It will guide you to her lair.
[110:50.12]May the gods protect you, knight.
[110:54.01]Hang on to me, Louise.
[110:56.21]We're going to find the demon.
[110:57.43]Why is the room so dark?
[110:58.37]Could we turn it off?
[110:59.13]Because it was more immersive that way.
[111:04.44]Alright, let's go.
[111:05.94]Just bring with your neck tucked in, or I should just like... Embarrass him.
[111:11.04]It's not a hickey.
[111:14.85]Yeah, no eye protection here.
[111:27.07]Turn off the facecam, I'm eating.
[111:28.53]I'll try this one more time.
[111:33.97]And then, um... We might give it a rest after this.
[111:39.65]Where are my eyebrows?
[111:41.13]I have eyebrows.
[111:42.33]Maybe you can't see them.
[111:43.15]Let's go this way.
[111:52.44]What am I... I'm not...
[111:56.41]Never mind.
[111:56.95]Okay.
[112:04.37]I already know how to do this one.
[112:18.44]Over this way.
[112:26.48]Where is he?
[112:30.22]That is like flashing the whole entire room because it's dark.
[112:34.97]Why didn't everybody tell me that was happening?
[112:43.83]That's actually... How can he do Jerma here in the dark?
[112:56.36]How can this guy hear in the dark?
[112:57.88]He's probably dead.
[112:59.58]What's the top left?
[113:00.31]That's the actual... That's better.
[113:26.43]Okay.
[113:26.65]This is where I have to find the song.
[113:30.33]Yeah, that's the game screen.
[113:37.17]The eye wandering?
[113:38.13]What do you mean, the eye wandering?
[113:42.65]What are these marks on my shoulder?
[113:44.61]I just, like, scratched a bug and it turned into that.
[113:47.56]I have, like, poisonous hands, apparently.
[113:51.68]Okay, so hold on.
[113:52.64]Can we think of a game plan here for this?
[113:55.44]So...
[113:57.50]If I can't, she's ranged.
[113:59.18]So do I have to cut through the fireballs?
[114:06.12]Am I going to have to slice through her fireballs to impress her?
[114:11.40]I have to time that correctly.
[114:12.92]It's over here.
[114:22.11]Left now, right?
[114:28.48]Okay, yeah, we're getting close.
[114:31.80]Dirty scratching nails poisoned your daughter.
[114:37.80]You look like Jerma from Jerma Rumble.
[114:41.52]I wonder why that is.
[114:42.74]It has nothing to do with the fact that it's me!
[114:51.47]It's actually him!
[114:54.83]Hold on, hold on, I gotta listen.
[114:55.77]What is he saying?
[115:00.18]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[115:00.86]Spread ahead.
[115:23.47]She's right here.
[115:24.11]She's right in front of me.
[115:26.33]Hello?
[115:38.70]It's right here!
[115:42.96]It's right here!
[115:51.67]Answer the phone!
[116:04.94]Okay, here we go.
[116:14.57]Found her.
[116:16.66]What are you doing here?
[116:17.90]Okay, I gotta cut through this shit.
[116:20.10]I'm ready.
[116:24.78]Here we go, okay.
[116:25.48]Shit, hold on.
[116:25.84]I can't fix it.
[117:00.00]That's not working.
[117:01.46]It's not working.
[117:25.69]She's far away.
[117:26.67]She's throwing fireballs at me.
[117:32.47]I can't walk forward.
[117:36.47]There is no walking in combat.
[117:38.24]It's only sword and shield.
[117:39.56]You can't walk.
[117:40.66]You can't go anywhere.
[117:43.78]So is she actually fucking far away from me?
[117:47.52]Or is she not far away from me?
[117:49.32]I don't think she is.
[117:50.00]You can't parry her fireballs.
[117:59.49]Hit before she throws the fireball.
[118:00.95]Well, I'm just going to swing the air.
[118:02.67]Isn't that what I was doing before?
[118:03.78]Open your eyes.
[118:05.62]You can't just Jedi lightsaber her fireballs.
[118:10.28]I guess, I don't know.
[118:10.78]Maybe you can, but I might be missing.
[118:23.66]You can hit her.
[118:25.96]So if she's standing in front of me, throwing fireballs a foot and a half in front of me?
[118:32.52]When she says don't take a step forward, I lose control of the character anyway, so I can't move.
[118:39.39]I have no idea what's going on.
[118:56.77]Really, I really would, like... Why the fuck is the checkpoint all the way back here before that last thing?
[119:02.83]For something as... mind-alteringly hard, why would the checkpoint be this far away?
[119:06.82]Throw it at her, just...
[119:26.95]Over here.
[119:27.89]Over here.
[119:28.13]Alright, this is the last attempt, and if I don't win, I'm gonna close it.
[119:30.88]On your right.
[119:32.18]Over here.
[119:33.68]Go straight ahead.
[119:36.16]Over here.
[119:37.22]Over here.
[119:37.68]On your left.
[119:39.44]Quickly.
[119:40.24]Fucking god.
[119:41.44]Go home.
[119:42.26]Go home.
[119:43.00]Get a little more to the right.
[119:44.82]Why is this guy still here?
[119:46.31]Over here.
[119:47.61]Over here.
[119:48.11]Alright, hold on.
[119:48.73]I have one headphone in.
[119:50.37]How am I gonna fucking play this?
[119:53.89]I'm si- that's why.
[119:54.87]So, she is in front of me.
[119:56.77]Hang on to me, Louise.
[120:22.80]We're going to find the demon.
[120:24.32]Alright, here we go.
[120:26.14]What's the light behind me?
[120:26.96]I don't know.
[120:30.26]Just don't use my shield at all.
[120:33.26]I need to be able to listen for it.
[120:35.06]On the first grunt or the second grunt?
[120:37.01]She does two.
[120:38.13]She goes... Alright, watch over this guy.
[120:53.23]Nice pool lighting.
[120:55.50]Yeah, I'm currently in a pool right now.
[120:58.10]I'm hanging out in a pool.
[121:01.66]That was fucking funny.
[121:03.54]That guy deserves an A+.
[121:04.52]Pool lighting, I'm sitting outside.
[121:07.68]Yeah, it's a nice night out.
[121:09.82]No, the only thing that would make that funnier is if this changed from blue to green to red to purple to blue every 30 seconds or so.
[121:19.57]That would be a real fucking pull.
[121:22.47]Alright, fight this stupid winged monster thing.
[121:29.39]Alright, here we go.
[121:34.50]And this is the parent who's carrying this guy.
[121:39.86]Alright, here he comes.
[121:49.72]Over on the right.
[121:54.27]I've memorized this dude.
[121:58.67]I can hit him twice.
[122:08.61]Hey, it's me, the demon.
[122:13.50]I'm watching a Ransom video.
[122:22.97]And what, I have to play through a blind legend to be able to not get kidnapped?
[122:29.19]Alright, die!
[122:37.33]Okay.
[122:41.57]Hold on, my Louise.
[122:43.03]Don't fall asleep.
[122:44.07]Stay with me.
[122:46.51]Take a video of water vapors and overlay it on the screen.
[122:52.82]Alright, let's try this one more time before I rage quit this game.
[123:00.62]Indeed, it's from Paranormal Activity.
[123:04.04]Looks like one of those scenes.
[123:06.27]Yeah, but I have to be talking into the camera doing like a vlog or something.
[123:09.29]Or Skyping with my boyfriend or girlfriend.
[123:11.91]Alright, let's follow this.
[123:19.61]Hey, so what'd you do today, honey?
[123:21.53]Uh, nothing much.
[123:22.23]Just hung out.
[123:23.55]Went to the store.
[123:27.65]Unfriended 2.
[123:36.98]What a fucking dumb movie, by the way.
[123:39.66]Unfriended 2.
[123:40.56]That makes me angry that that movie actually exists.
[123:49.61]Didn't the Slender Man movie just come out?
[123:52.93]Think about that.
[123:54.55]Slender Man the movie came out five fucking years after that was even barely relevant still.
[124:02.85]What?
[124:04.55]Why would you make that fucking movie?
[124:06.91]How stupid, how brainless do you have to be to make a Slender Man movie five fucking years later?
[124:16.87]That movie costed... That was millions, fucking millions of dollars that was spent on that movie.
[124:26.06]No... It's a terrible fucking movie.
[124:28.96]It's got like 14% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[124:31.06]Nobody likes it.
[124:31.56]It's a piece of shit.
[124:32.88]What's wrong with you?
[124:36.56]Give that money to... Just go out in a fucking Zeppelin and drop it over New York.
[124:41.30]Seriously.
[124:42.70]What the fuck are you doing with your money?
[124:54.59]Okay, here we go.
[124:56.21]Come on, man.
[124:57.71]Waterfall.
[125:05.46]Fun, the next rat movie.
[125:07.02]Here we go.
[125:10.60]I think it's behind me.
[125:15.92]Stop talking.
[125:17.58]Stop it.
[125:17.94]It's over here.
[125:31.20]Make the noise.
[125:31.86]Oh, it's Tag here?
[125:36.32]What up, Tag?
[125:41.73]How you doing, dude?
[125:42.31]Okay, I need to close my eyes.
[125:53.98]I'm like standing right on it.
[126:00.41]Okay, here we go.
[126:02.37]Made it.
[126:03.21]I'm gonna swing at her when she makes the grunt.
[126:05.01]She's gonna go, huh, stab.
[126:08.54]We're gonna try it on the first grunt.
[126:09.82]If it doesn't work, I'm gonna do it on the second grunt.
[126:11.44]Here we go.
[126:11.94]I'm ready.
[126:12.22]First grunt.
[126:12.88]Huh, stab.
[126:13.30]That's not the first one.
[126:15.24]That's her battle rage cry.
[126:31.01]Got it.
[126:37.20]What?
[126:37.44]What the fuck is happening?
[126:38.30]Did I kill her?
[126:41.98]She's like floating around.
[126:42.78]She's like a witch.
[126:54.28]She's a demon.
[126:54.94]Well, I know.
[126:55.54]She has to be eradicated.
[127:04.06]She needs to be eradicated.
[127:09.10]Right in front of me.
[127:13.13]Headbutt.
[127:15.23]You must die!
[127:16.17]I have not come to fight you, demon.
[127:24.35]I need your help.
[127:26.11]Save my daughter.
[127:27.33]Why should I?
[127:28.89]Because she is a child.
[127:30.59]That's it.
[127:30.87]It's because she's a child.
[127:33.19]The lunacy.
[127:39.02]The camera can't even keep up with me, man.
[127:40.46]I'm so fucking quick.
[127:42.06]The camera can't... Okay.
[127:57.47]Not now.
[127:58.11]Not that is now, man.
[128:03.69]I have to take it out for a second, seriously.
[128:05.35]Like, that was not fucking funny.
[128:08.29]This is so loud, though.
[128:09.47]She will live.
[128:10.35]What is going on on the camera?
[128:12.52]Thank you.
[128:14.48]The spirit spoke to me, Knight.
[128:16.84]I have seen the crimes you have committed in the name of the Crown.
[128:20.62]In the past, before you lost your sight.
[128:23.86]There are atrocities that can never be undone.
[128:26.80]Alright, here we go.
[128:28.14]I am no longer that barbarian.
[128:29.34]Only you can prove it now, Edward Blake.
[128:32.69]I'm ready.
[128:35.31]Hey, we were about to rage quit the game right there.
[128:37.07]Thank God we didn't.
[128:38.43]Because now we're beating the whole game in 15 minutes.
[128:43.16]And is she the one who saved me?
[128:46.92]I think so.
[128:47.86]Yes.
[128:49.84]She took pity.
[128:54.88]See, it's cleared up.
[128:56.56]You shouldn't talk, Louise.
[128:57.64]You must save your strength.
[128:59.48]It's a long road ahead of us before we reach the dry lands.
[129:02.30]It's going to be weird when I turn the lights back on, isn't it?
[129:07.82]Okay.
[129:08.74]Looking good.
[129:09.36]A blind legend.
[129:14.50]The geezers?
[129:16.58]Like old geezers?
[129:17.26]Let's go.
[129:26.99]Alright, I'm gonna get back into it.
[129:30.31]Back in.
[129:32.95]It's much easier to play like this, I'm not even kidding.
[129:35.61]I'm not even kidding.
[129:36.58]I'm not even kidding.
[129:37.82]I gotta go, I'm not even kidding.
[129:39.26]Alright, let's go.
[129:56.24]Nice.
[129:56.54]Now I think we're at the beach.
[129:59.76]That's the beach.
[130:00.52]That's a beach, right?
[130:01.36]We're very clearly walking on the beach.
[130:09.46]Yeah, it's a beach.
[130:10.78]I love the beach.
[130:12.92]Who doesn't like the beach?
[130:13.76]I wish I could have the mic in the game for me.
[130:15.78]So I could respond.
[130:30.58]Is this a beach?
[130:31.16]See?
[130:32.12]Big wave.
[130:34.00]What?
[130:34.20]Did she tell the truth?
[130:38.36]Do I have to do that again?
[131:00.06]Alright, straight ahead, straight ahead.
[131:01.04]Alright, straight ahead.
[131:10.53]I'll be honest with you though.
[131:12.89]For a game that's like six dollars, this is already two hours plus into the game and there's still stuff to do.
[131:19.11]We're still going.
[131:24.19]Did I not make it?
[131:27.05]These giant waves!
[131:35.95]Now what?
[131:39.01]You have to say now before you start running.
[131:40.47]She started running and then said now.
[131:42.44]Mistake.
[131:42.80]Last geyser.
[131:45.44]Fucking god damn.
[131:46.06]No, not another one of these.
[131:47.14]No, not another one of these.
[131:48.34]I don't want to do this again.
[131:49.68]No, god damn it.
[132:04.46]I'm not gonna fall into a lava pit and turn into Han Solo.
[132:06.90]Okay.
[132:08.44]Straight ahead.
[132:10.64]Don't lie to me.
[132:11.32]This way.
[132:11.99]No.
[132:12.21]Ah!
[132:37.80]It's alright.
[132:39.20]Let's get out of here, okay?
[132:40.38]Stop it!
[132:50.57]It's still going.
[132:52.35]Okay.
[133:03.07]Now what?
[133:05.57]Where am I?
[133:07.44]What's going on?
[133:13.86]Don't do that again.
[133:14.60]I swear to god if somebody throws a flashbang around the corner... Oh, sorry father!
[133:19.86]I dropped a flashbang and spawned!
[133:40.19]We're narrow.
[133:41.57]Very narrow.
[133:45.14]This way.
[133:47.62]Straight?
[133:58.99]If we die here, I might have to rage quit the game.
[134:01.67]Because we're going to have to do that all over again.
[134:04.33]Just don't die.
[134:04.91]As long as I don't lose to the next monster.
[134:13.12]Okay, good.
[134:15.92]That's right, like, that's not even... I can put my arm up and that's three meters.
[134:21.76]Alright, thank God.
[134:22.96]Thank God we made it.
[134:26.01]I'm so happy about that.
[134:28.43]Okay, here comes another fight.
[134:30.47]Yeah.
[134:30.67]Okay.
[134:42.13]Bigger than me.
[134:48.36]They're going to eat us!
[135:10.29]That's the first thing you think of.
[135:11.21]To the left.
[135:28.28]Is that it?
[135:32.34]Get the fuck out of here.
[135:45.06]Whoa, whoa, huh?
[135:47.38]Whoa!
[135:49.38]You...
[136:20.18]Get her!
[136:24.32]Got her!
[136:26.04]Yeah, I got her.
[136:33.12]Fuck, man.
[136:37.42]Please don't do that again.
[136:40.08]Go.
[136:42.22]Thank you.
[136:42.96]My god.
[136:43.56]Please give me a checkpoint there.
[136:45.96]That was rough.
[136:53.00]I feel like we're getting close.
[137:01.71]Just keep going.
[137:02.87]Is she gonna tell me to stop and I'm not gonna get burnt up by a lava wave?
[137:06.35]There's a robo.
[137:07.73]Watch out for the robo.
[137:20.08]The soldiers, they found us.
[137:23.02]Run and hide in the boat, Louise.
[137:24.47]I'm right behind you.
[137:25.39]Alright, here we go.
[137:30.63]This way.
[137:37.67]Go!
[137:39.03]Am I paddling the boat?
[137:41.49]Am I like paddling in the water?
[137:43.23]Are we doing the doggy paddle?
[137:52.36]What?
[137:56.94]Where's the rope?
[137:59.52]Where's the rope?
[138:02.04]Okay, I got it!
[138:03.58]Let's go!
[138:07.70]I just swung around and hit the thing.
[138:19.38]I just got hit in the back of the head with an oar.
[138:21.22]I'm just kidding.
[138:23.36]They were frying it.
[138:24.70]Hold on a minute.
[138:27.88]I got it.
[138:28.40]Let me get it.
[138:30.28]Somebody threw a rock.
[138:32.44]Okay, I get it.
[138:33.10]I fucking died.
[138:39.22]I didn't know I had to cut the... I'm sitting there wildly swinging.
[138:46.54]Alright, just gotta make it, cut the thing, get out into sea.
[138:49.20]Let's go.
[138:49.78]A few meters?
[138:50.30]We ran like a half mile.
[138:51.36]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[138:53.10]Go.
[139:14.24]Straight.
[139:15.76]Then I gotta whip out the knife.
[139:16.80]Okay, here we go.
[139:28.70]Shit!
[139:30.23]God damn it!
[139:34.51]Where is it?
[139:35.63]I can't untie the rope!
[139:43.33]Go!
[139:44.17]Go!
[139:45.59]Give me the oars, Louise!
[139:46.95]Quickly!
[139:47.43]Quick!
[139:49.17]Give it!
[139:51.79]I don't... Wait!
[139:52.43]What?
[139:52.61]Father!
[139:55.31]No!
[140:01.11]I don't understand.
[140:09.26]Loading.
[140:18.41]The oars!
[140:22.29]What are you supposed to do?
[140:23.79]I don't know.
[140:26.21]I gotta get... She has to tell me that the rope is there.
[140:29.32]Because without her saying that... There's, um... Use my shield?
[140:37.84]I think we just have to get out faster than that.
[140:39.54]Okay.
[140:44.86]I have to get to the position where she says, cut the rope, so I can cut them open.
[140:47.86]I don't know what direction I'm supposed to go.
[140:49.88]Let's go.
[141:00.63]Wait, did I run by her?
[141:24.09]I think I hear something.
[141:27.87]Alright, I gotta get in for this one.
[141:36.50]It's easier to know where I'm going.
[141:43.24]We're painfully close to the end of the game.
[141:45.26]Alright.
[141:47.02]I have to finish this.
[141:50.09]If there's another, like, four hours of content, then maybe not.
[141:52.35]But if there's, like, 30 more minutes... Come on, right?
[141:56.01]Alright, got my headphones in.
[142:00.69]Just run straight.
[142:02.23]Wait till you hear the sound.
[142:03.05]Okay.
[142:03.15]There's the rowboat.
[142:05.69]A few meters out.
[142:07.57]I just gotta get in the position.
[142:19.55]What?
[142:19.73]What the fuck was that?
[142:20.83]What are you talking about?
[142:22.01]What are you talking about?
[142:23.25]I haven't done anything different.
[142:55.43]And we're dead.
[143:03.99]And we're dead.
[143:05.17]I'm dead.
[143:10.10]Oh my fucking god.
[143:14.94]Alright, she told me to run straight ahead, I ran straight ahead, and then apparently I ran by her.
[143:26.74]loading the sea at last this way this way straight ahead straight ahead here's the sword you ran in the water see it's a few meters but I don't I don't know why the I did it perfectly the first two times get there quickly but now it just seems like I'm running buyer
[143:56.42]Yes, great.
[143:57.00]That's great.
[143:58.01]I'm glad to hear the same dialog ten fucking times.
[144:03.05]You can't just put me here.
[144:05.01]Like... Like here.
[144:08.14]You can't put me there.
[144:09.58]They found us.
[144:11.10]Run and hide in the boat, Louise.
[144:12.54]I'm right behind you.
[144:37.50]Go, go, go!
[144:42.11]Go!
[144:42.77]Go!
[144:43.67]That was perfect!

[144:50.75]Out!
[144:52.86]Out!
[144:57.84]Out!
[145:03.91]Loading.
[145:06.93]I can't believe that, just, I did it.
[145:10.74]To Ro, rotate your joystick.
[145:13.42]Keep a steady rhythm, and don't go too fast.
[145:17.04]Otherwise you will not move, and Louise will advise you to slow down.
[145:21.95]Now it's your turn.
[145:45.03]Okay.
[146:17.79]Are they getting close?
[146:24.03]We on boats?
[146:24.79]Two different boats?
[146:28.69]What?
[146:29.05]Wait, why are they... Okay, we're good.
[146:39.56]Easy with the language.
[146:40.62]We're just getting attacked and almost died five fucking times.
[146:49.84]We made it.
[146:50.46]Hey, don't give away our plan!
[146:51.70]So, hide.
[146:52.66]Am I just standing still, like... Follow me!
[147:18.86]Let's go.
[147:20.10]We can blend into the crowd.
[147:21.12]I just said yo.
[147:22.34]Yo.
[147:23.24]Hey, yo, yo.
[147:24.26]They didn't say yo back in, like, the 1200s.

[148:35.63]What was that?
[148:55.43]Why did he just go...
[149:11.70]How's that not hitting him?
[149:23.39]What the fuck?

[149:27.99]Got it.
[149:31.56]Parry.
[149:56.35]Death swing.
[149:57.05]Alright, he's dead.
[150:06.42]Sometimes they take a long time to tell you what they're about to do.
[150:08.64]Is that it?
[150:28.24]Why do some of them sound like they're... This guy to my right.
[150:35.46]Oh, he was alive.
[150:38.56]Oh, he...
[150:57.99]Okay.
[150:58.87]He was just lying.
