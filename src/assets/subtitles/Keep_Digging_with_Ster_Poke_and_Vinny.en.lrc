[00:00.03]similar to games you've played green hell really I remember that one digging hole is great for yap slop okay yep slop oh man do you what's your favorite type of nap slop did we talk about this like what what videos do you put on when you're about to nap do you have anything like that I watched summit I
[00:25.51]I watch the stream.
[00:26.97]I love Nile Red and Nile Blue.
[00:29.82]It is awesome.
[00:30.68]It is the most relaxing.
[00:31.92]You learn about all kinds of shit.
[00:33.66]You make so much interesting stuff.
[00:35.08]I love it.
[00:35.77]Nile Red's a great channel.
[00:39.93]I don't like watching videos.
[00:41.99]I don't like watching things I know that will end because then there'll be nothing in an hour.
[00:47.52]Yeah, you want to wake up with the video still on.
[00:50.30]The ozone thing is really going to end everything.
[00:52.85]Yeah, that really screwed me up.
[00:54.15]Alright, start digging.
[00:55.25]I think we have to... I think there's a... Visit another world.
[01:03.02]Okay.
[01:03.46]You can find the invite code in the escape invite other players menu of the player you're joining.
[01:09.31]I think somebody has to be in a world.
[01:16.22]And it is an invite code.
[01:18.19]I can't believe that we're doing this instead of a jackbox party pack, but...
[01:21.64]I mean do you want to I I I am I'm ready to hear the debate no no no I'm just vibe checking when when I say these things Jerma like I'm not actually suggesting we do it you're gonna love the digging game it's awesome Overwatch has got a really good patch look people are liking this Overwatch patch well I don't know since the battlefield changed their movement I think I would rather drink pee than play Overwatch I'm sorry let's play deadlock yeah I don't I don't really care for that very much oh drinking pee
[01:52.32]Yo, there's a clown in this game that you can unlock.
[01:58.11]I'm in.
[01:58.47]Alright.
[02:00.71]Should I start dig?
[02:05.06]Who wants to host?
[02:06.36]Ster loves hosting.
[02:08.36]Hold on.
[02:08.92]I had to install and buy the game because I wasn't sure if we were really going to keep digging.
[02:13.01]I'm telling you, this game is going to be awesome.
[02:15.71]I'm down for Jackbox.
[02:16.78]I'm down for Turtle as well.
[02:19.42]Later or next week.
[02:20.06]I'll set it up.
[02:21.16]For sure.
[02:22.16]Okay, tomorrow?
[02:24.10]I can't tomorrow.
[02:25.26]Okay.
[02:26.99]The next day?
[02:27.69]Pog, these two are kind of the vibes are getting a little racked up a little bit.
[02:31.57]I'm not a fan of this.
[02:32.91]This is some tension here.
[02:34.82]Next Thursday?
[02:36.80]Yeah, yeah.
[02:38.72]Okay, cool.
[02:39.18]Everyone's showing up next Thursday.
[02:40.53]Right, Jerma?
[02:42.11]Okay.
[02:43.21]Wait, what is next Thursday?
[02:44.01]What's the day?
[02:46.07]Is that my birthday?
[02:48.40]I don't know.
[02:48.84]Is it?
[02:49.74]You don't know my birthday?
[02:53.19]Okay, I'm going to invite you guys to mine.
[02:56.87]This game is compiling 4,000 shaders so that we can dig into grass.
[03:01.41]It's good.
[03:01.71]You're going to like it.
[03:02.82]It's really good.
[03:03.70]Okay, here we go.
[03:04.36]Invite player.
[03:05.96]What, you played it?
[03:07.42]No.
[03:11.32]It's going to be awesome.
[03:12.26]If this game is not fun, I take responsibility.
[03:14.99]I did say, hey, this is a digging game.
[03:17.27]So I take responsibility if it sucks.
[03:20.59]No, I also wanted to dig because I like that other digging game so much.
[03:26.02]I got an invite code.
[03:30.58]I'm going to copy it and I'm going to paste it.
[03:33.99]Visit another world.
[03:36.55]I'm ready whenever you're ready.
[03:37.94]My computer is overheating.
[03:39.58]This game is going to be a graphical masterpiece.
[03:42.18]Do you guys have ray tracing on?
[03:44.36]Oh, yeah.
[03:46.11]I have nanotechnology as I play.
[03:50.31]Is your computer really going crazy?
[03:55.79]I'm in.
[03:56.86]I'm loading, I think.
[04:03.69]Shaders compiling.
[04:05.55]Now that's the power of a 5080.
[04:06.63]Hell yeah.
[04:10.17]Oh my god.
[04:16.90]You guys want to go out in the desert and dig a real hole?
[04:20.29]Yeah, I think Jerma did that already.
[04:22.78]Whoa.
[04:23.70]Dude, we are playing Ninja Turtles.
[04:26.80]What?
[04:28.28]Your face was scaring me.
[04:30.41]Wait, wait, hold on.
[04:31.11]Wait for everybody to get in.
[04:32.21]Hold on.
[04:32.65]Don't start digging.
[04:33.51]Dude, dude, dude.
[04:34.93]Dude.
[04:35.31]Do you guys see like the blurriness in this game?
[04:39.46]Am I crazy?
[04:40.86]No, it's pretty blurry.
[04:43.42]Jill is a slop.
[04:44.98]Is it DL?
[04:45.64]I don't even know if it's turned on.
[04:48.93]Mine's running pretty fine.
[04:52.71]Where's Ster?
[04:57.00]I'm coming.
[04:57.64]I had to download.
[04:58.52]I had to buy.
[04:59.16]I had to compile.
[04:59.62]You want to set this game's graphics low.
[05:01.78]Set the game's graphics low, I'm being told by my chat, because it'll help.
[05:06.00]It's compiling shaders again.
[05:07.72]Yeah.
[05:09.41]This is the power.
[05:10.09]This is the power.
[05:11.55]Low is nice.
[05:13.37]Low is better, yeah.
[05:15.05]Low.
[05:15.95]What the fuck did you message me with, fuck?
[05:20.40]Oh, I need a URL.
[05:22.77]Is there no game audio?
[05:23.99]Hold on.
[05:24.59]That's a good one.
[05:25.33]It's very, very little.
[05:28.71]Should be able to hear it now.
[05:38.10]Why is the shift button jump?
[05:40.03]I don't like that.
[05:40.87]Yeah.
[05:41.11]Is there a run?
[05:42.37]Let's see.
[05:42.69]Hold on.
[05:43.01]Help me.
[05:44.85]There's no controls.
[05:46.99]There's no way to like... Oh, you have to do this when you look.
[05:50.52]Oh, oops.
[05:53.01]Oh, yeah, yeah, hang on, hang on, hold, yeah.
[05:57.47]How did you get a shirt?
[06:00.65]Uh, there's dynamite in this game, so why would you be able to do that?
[06:04.58]Why would you be able to do that in this game?
[06:07.44]Why?
[06:07.78]For what reason?
[06:10.22]It's a fuckface game.
[06:12.10]You know why.
[06:13.93]Wait, why is there a punch?
[06:15.29]How do I punch?
[06:17.37]You can only middle finger for now.
[06:18.73]I think you did by DLC.
[06:20.05]Oh, man.
[06:21.23]Of course.
[06:23.23]Why does your hand get huge?
[06:25.75]Alright, are we ready to dig?
[06:26.67]So you grab stuff, and then you sell it to the guy.
[06:29.90]Alright, so this guy, you sell stone, sell.
[06:31.54]Alright, let's go.
[06:34.11]I want my own section over here.
[06:41.42]Can you run?
[06:41.92]There's no settings page.
[06:44.88]Yeah, there's no settings.
[06:47.35]This is the future of gaming.
[06:48.99]You unlock the other emotes via gameplay.
[06:52.36]wow that's cool you probably unlock settings too I'm getting achievements but you're picking up iron for the first time it's like bro it's in the first it's in the very beginning should we build together together I think we do we share money I'm thinking you can use the upgrade bench how do you you have to sleep I think these graphics suck
[07:16.89]Guys, I'm digging.
[07:18.70]You were so mad about it.
[07:23.87]These graphics suck.
[07:26.33]We've degressed.
[07:28.19]What's the word?
[07:29.48]Regressed?
[07:30.62]Regressed.
[07:31.90]Wasted.
[07:32.52]Oh, that was so funny.
[07:33.73]Guys, I died and it said wasted.
[07:36.05]Wait, how did you die?
[07:36.95]I don't know.
[07:38.23]I dug too much, I guess.
[07:40.11]Is there no oxygen down there?
[07:41.60]Oh, I only have 10 energy.
[07:42.86]Oh, fuck.
[07:44.16]We need to work together.
[07:46.42]Where do you sleep?
[07:48.67]Yeah, I don't know.
[07:50.41]Also, when you upgrade your shovel, you have to use mouse wheel to equip the next shovel.
[07:55.72]Oh, dude, I got a bigger backpack.
[07:57.76]I got so much more battery.
[07:59.09]Telling you, it's incremental friend slop.
[08:02.01]This is great.
[08:04.07]I actually love this already.
[08:05.96]Yep.
[08:06.80]I knew you would.
[08:08.06]You have to buy batteries for yourself?
[08:13.49]Wire rope?
[08:15.03]Yeah, we got to be careful because what if we dig too far?
[08:18.71]You got to buy battery charge at the dude.
[08:22.45]Criken really enjoys this.
[08:24.01]I recommend you stick with it.
[08:25.29]It goes places.
[08:26.60]I trust Criken.
[08:28.66]Okay.
[08:30.32]Fast travel.
[08:32.92]What if you can't get it?
[08:34.21]I died!
[08:35.15]Oh my god, sorry.
[08:36.05]It was the screamer.
[08:41.44]Wait, how'd you die?
[08:42.78]I don't know.
[08:43.16]It was like a dark... Literally, they stole the Dark Souls picture.
[08:51.66]I wanna see it, how do you die?
[08:55.39]Wait, what the fuck is going on, guys?
[08:57.99]Help!
[08:58.33]Help!
[08:59.13]Help!
[09:00.93]Help!
[09:01.68]What's happening?
[09:02.44]Look up!
[09:02.74]He's flying away!
[09:03.42]He's flying away!
[09:04.18]What do I do?
[09:04.72]What do I do?
[09:05.46]What do I do?
[09:06.92]Dig!
[09:07.14]Dig!
[09:10.27]Oh, okay.
[09:11.03]I'm dead.
[09:12.47]And you didn't die.
[09:14.23]Oh.
[09:16.46]I like how the material just pops up out of nowhere.
[09:18.20]It doesn't even, like, show that it was in there.
[09:20.26]Yeah, nice.
[09:21.15]It's really cool.
[09:23.21]Really cool.
[09:24.69]Wow.
[09:24.79]I just picked up, like, a money box.
[09:26.47]Is it Friendly Fire?
[09:29.48]Friendly Fire in a digging game.
[09:31.74]I mean, I can hit you in the head with a shovel.
[09:34.09]Yeah, you might be right.
[09:34.93]I don't know.
[09:36.49]Vinny, you ever play Red Faction 1?
[09:39.79]I did.
[09:40.44]I did, yeah.
[09:41.00]That game's amazing.
[09:42.78]Not recently, no.
[09:43.68]I would recommend a replay.
[09:46.62]Okay.
[09:47.00]What about Gorilla?
[09:48.37]To anyone and everyone.
[09:49.53]That's great.
[09:49.85]What about the Gorilla one?
[09:52.37]That Donkey Kong?
[09:53.66]No, Red Faction 3?
[09:56.14]Gorilla something?
[09:57.30]Yeah.
[09:57.82]Oh, Gorilla.
[09:58.75]Like, Gorilla.
[10:00.07]Yes, yes, yes.
[10:01.29]That one was good.
[10:02.17]I liked that one.
[10:03.05]I played, I think, all of the Red Faction series a little bit.
[10:07.10]They're fun.
[10:07.74]They're good games.
[10:09.81]It holds up, and it's also goofier than you might remember at the same time.
[10:15.20]That's good.
[10:15.80]You guys are missing the silver.
[10:17.72]There's a hole!
[10:19.71]In the hole.
[10:20.63]Whoa, there's a treasure chest.
[10:23.05]I can't get it.
[10:23.59]This game goes places.
[10:24.95]Dude, climb boost times one?
[10:28.56]Is there silver in here?
[10:29.32]How do we get it?
[10:31.68]Guys, should I come down or no?
[10:33.79]I wouldn't recommend it until we can figure out how to get back up.
[10:37.43]Did you buy the rope?
[10:38.60]I think I was holding shift.
[10:41.00]I got a warp stone.
[10:43.48]Oh, hold shift.
[10:44.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:44.78]Just hold shift if you buy the rope.
[10:46.23]There's a fucking M16 down here.
[10:50.65]Dude, this is going places, actually.
[10:54.98]There's going to be aliens.
[10:56.80]I like aliens.
[10:57.58]I didn't buy a rope.
[10:58.46]How do we not die?
[10:59.72]What?
[11:00.89]You can't have... Your battery needs to go above zero or you die.
[11:05.45]yeah you need to have the battery I'm in the hole so like what do I do you're gonna have to I don't know you maybe probably die you're just gonna have to die what do you lose for dying probably what you probably the money that you have maybe a portion of your money maybe we have on you we could make a pack use mouse wheel to switch to your upgraded pickaxe that's important oh we don't share money right like we have our own money
[11:36.26]I think so.
[11:37.22]I'm at five bucks, y'all.
[11:38.26]Yeah, do we have an inventory?
[11:39.69]I picked up a spare battery.
[11:41.93]It should be the backpack.
[11:42.49]It's just there.
[11:43.57]Yeah, you'll just use the spare battery when you run out.
[11:46.37]When I picked it up, I didn't... Oh, I do have times one.
[11:49.06]I see.
[11:49.86]We've got to decide where... Is low really the best?
[11:51.50]I'm going to try high.
[11:52.94]I'm on high, and it seems like it's fine.
[11:54.33]I mean, it doesn't look... I mean, it looks like it's... Okay.
[12:00.19]Who fucking got a rope to go up?
[12:03.31]Vinny.
[12:03.75]Dude, this goes down even further.
[12:05.89]Oh shit, I have no battery.
[12:07.50]There's another big hole under here near me.
[12:11.74]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[12:12.52]Oh man.
[12:13.24]Um.
[12:13.48]Yeah.
[12:15.15]Whatever.
[12:16.53]Worker level has increased times one.
[12:21.85]No way.
[12:25.26]Oh, you really do lose what you have.
[12:26.64]Okay.
[12:28.20]And there is no sprint.
[12:30.28]We need a rope.
[12:31.03]No.
[12:32.25]Do you keep your money?
[12:37.31]guest worker level has increased cole what does that mean though oh money though I just got a thousand dollars I could do I got two thousand dollars in cash what two thousand oh it just I just found it I can't dig up because I can't pick up the iron and it's floating in the space you guys never use Instagram reels right
[13:02.64]No.
[13:02.92]I do.
[13:04.25]Do you get memes on there?
[13:05.53]Like, do you get, like, fucked up things?
[13:07.47]I don't.
[13:07.99]I just post my garbage.
[13:12.14]Oh, okay.
[13:12.46]Yeah.
[13:12.76]I don't know.
[13:13.22]There's one reel that's, like, really popular right now.
[13:15.62]Guys, I'm stuck.
[13:17.04]It just uses, like, AI TTS, but it's like, what kind of fucking bridge is this?
[13:23.15]Guys, I... I do not know this sick meme.
[13:26.77]You need to see...
[13:32.68]What kind of fucking bird is this?
[13:34.46]This is a bird that has a... What kind of fucking store is this?
[13:38.37]No, no!
[13:39.61]No, um... I have a thousand dollars and how do I teleport out of here?
[13:42.94]You gotta hold shift with the rope.
[13:44.60]I have a warp stone.
[13:46.18]Oh fuck, yeah, I'm good.
[13:47.70]If you get a warp stone it teleports to the top.
[13:49.89]Guys, I need help.
[13:51.27]Well, how can we help?
[13:52.11]How can I help you?
[13:53.09]Where are you?
[13:53.77]I started digging stairs up to the top and I'm stuck inside there and I can't move or dig or do anything.
[14:00.17]Okay, I'm helping.
[14:00.71]Because I'm stuck inside the iron I can't pick up.
[14:04.08]Hell yeah.
[14:05.68]Okay, can we dig a staircase up?
[14:08.30]I think you're better off just getting the rope.
[14:11.59]Well, did... It actually is bad.
[14:13.43]It's bad because... How do you use the rope?
[14:15.41]There's not enough... Okay, when you get down two or three levels like we are, there's not enough power to even get you back up with a full battery charge.
[14:22.54]We have to rethink our plan here.
[14:24.13]We have to make actual stairs.
[14:25.03]Oh, we got up.
[14:25.55]We got up.
[14:26.37]We did it.
[14:27.69]Kinda made stairs.
[14:28.80]Kinda.
[14:29.06]Oh!
[14:30.02]We're like little fucking ants!
[14:33.09]I'm gonna clear a path here.
[14:33.93]If you upgrade the wire rope, it is better.
[14:41.80]Yeah, make like a little Jump King level.
[14:44.67]To get down.
[14:49.50]What kind of fucking hole is this?
[14:52.36]Is that like a verbal thing?
[14:53.70]That's like, just like, are you just saying that in your head?
[14:56.60]I know exactly what happened.
[14:58.02]I do that shit too.
[15:01.39]How do you use the rope?
[15:04.17]Holy shit.
[15:05.01]What is this?

[35:20.16]Okay, well we found a thing, but there's no warp here.
[35:24.85]Watch your energy.
[35:25.71]I wish you could eat like a hamburger or something and get stronger.
[35:28.45]Oh, my energy's locked.
[35:29.94]Just backup batteries.
[35:31.10]That's the only way.
[35:33.75]Don't I have a backup battery?
[35:34.91]How do you use it?
[35:35.91]It uses it automatically.
[35:38.04]Oh, okay.
[35:51.24]Once again, not worth it.
[35:53.20]I know, it's bad looking down.
[35:54.68]Wait, you guys, you picked this, so fucking enjoy it.
[36:02.74]I have 18k, I don't want to lose it.
[36:04.40]I can't lose this 18k.
[36:05.40]You have a warp stone?
[36:07.92]No.
[36:09.37]So, when we get wherever, you can press Q. Oh, there it is.
[36:14.62]We're somewhere.
[36:16.94]If you press Q, and you find like a, it looks like a
[36:21.34]There's chests down here.
[36:23.43]Flying boost.
[36:24.83]Nice.
[36:30.40]Oh, we got warps here.
[36:32.60]Batteries and warps.
[36:34.32]That was it?
[36:35.57]How do you activate a spare battery?
[36:38.45]It'll activate it on its own.
[36:39.29]Who needs a warp?
[36:39.89]There's one right here.
[36:43.00]Okay.
[36:43.40]There's an emergency warp in front of me.
[36:47.54]It's in front.
[36:47.96]Yeah, right there.
[36:49.93]I'm home.
[36:51.50]Wait, we're fucking doing teamwork?
[36:54.80]Yeah.
[36:55.88]Ooh, there's a lever.
[36:56.99]Or a bone.
[36:57.61]Bones down here.
[37:01.07]Oh, damn it.
[37:02.27]I gotta go back.
[37:03.63]We don't have a thing yet?
[37:05.69]No, but we can just jump into our holes.
[37:08.84]Yeah, I gotta remember where those are.
[37:10.90]It's not too bad.
[37:12.02]They're pretty much right by the... Look at all these gems.
[37:18.87]Alright, Ster, I'm gonna throw a bomb.
[37:20.31]Back up.
[37:23.43]I'm going to drop a dynamite down here.
[37:27.07]We can operate our dynamite.
[37:31.03]I don't think the bombs hurt.
[37:32.04]I tried to kill you all with a bomb a second ago.
[37:34.02]The bombs don't hurt.
[37:35.70]But you can upgrade them because they kind of suck right now.
[37:38.30]I forgot to recharge.
[37:40.36]Did it even explode?
[37:41.40]It does.
[37:42.89]Yeah, it just sucks.
[37:47.29]I didn't even do anything.
[37:50.25]I got to go back, but I don't want to lose out on a warp.
[37:53.70]We might have a warp in a minute at 4K.
[37:55.93]Do I have a battery?
[37:58.65]Hey, everybody in my chat, do I have a battery?
[38:02.20]It shows underneath your energy.
[38:03.56]It'll say times one times two.
[38:04.92]Oh, fuck yeah.
[38:05.56]We're good.
[38:06.02]Oh, you're right.
[38:06.82]I have one.
[38:09.55]Hey, there's a dinosaur bone up here of some kind.
[38:13.90]Remember to press Q.
[38:19.25]If you're having a hard time climbing, you can right click to create rock, which I didn't do.
[38:24.04]Only the host can pick up the dinosaur bone thing.
[38:26.42]I got it.
[38:28.18]You already got this big dinosaur leg?
[38:29.69]No, I will have it in a moment.
[38:31.43]So if you want to see the dinosaur being constructed in real time, when you go back up, look at across from the cell point.
[38:38.86]You'll see the dinosaur bones being added into a dinosaur.
[38:42.14]Very cool.
[38:43.31]I didn't know that was a thing, but it's cool.
[38:45.75]Alright, where is this?

[39:05.73]That drop is scary.
[39:07.37]This is your fifth time playing.
[39:09.53]Alright, 10 grand.
[39:15.06]Hurtless Miner Red.
[39:19.07]Wait, that sounded weird.
[39:21.05]You bet.
[39:23.06]Nothing else I can do here?
[39:26.34]Alright, I got a much better pickaxe now.
[39:27.90]Alright, I'm going back down.
[39:31.74]Did you guys get the one at 400?
[39:33.55]You should upgrade your speed.
[39:34.77]Yeah, yeah.
[39:36.51]I'm already at 700.
[39:37.31]Wait, no you're not.
[39:43.27]Why do you lie, Ster?
[39:45.92]Yeah, why lie like that?
[39:47.54]What's wrong with you?
[39:50.44]I'm just trying to keep it real.
[39:52.73]Make sure you guys are getting the spare batteries.
[39:54.65]They're kind of everywhere.
[39:56.03]Did you guys found the hole?
[39:58.52]Yeah.
[40:07.34]Big money.
[40:10.08]I'm just gonna.
[40:11.12]I'll take that.
[40:11.92]Let's go.
[40:19.05]Does it go crazy in VR?
[40:22.37]Oh, God.
[40:23.01]I feel like it'd be puke-inducing.
[40:24.65]Yeah, puke-inducing.
[40:25.49]Exactly that.
[40:27.96]Poke-inducing?
[40:30.00]Yo.
[40:30.62]That's not what I said, and you know it.
[40:33.40]Poke-induce me.
[40:36.31]Yo.
[40:41.80]So, where are we going?
[40:43.06]What's happening here?

[40:48.68]Kinda sucks down here, doesn't it?
[40:51.60]Fuck you!
[40:53.73]What's with you today?
[40:54.89]You notice, guys, he's kind of aggressive today?
[40:57.79]He's like, fuck you, shut up!
[41:00.70]Yeah, he's taking fuckface gaming too seriously, is what's happening.
[41:05.09]Yeah.
[41:06.11]Why is he being so toxic right now?
[41:09.21]Huge sapphire, $12,000.
[41:11.42]Who got that?
[41:12.76]Holy shit.
[41:14.08]Did you pick that up?

[41:43.62]Alright, we're at 421, 420.
[41:44.74]Just press shift.
[41:46.09]Go up.
[41:46.59]Go up with shift.
[41:47.77]Probably best.
[41:49.85]Yeah, we gotta find a way to go down again.
[41:52.83]Yeah.
[41:55.52]There's definitely a place to go down at 500, right?
[41:57.82]You know what?
[41:58.56]It's just by the... Keep digging.
[42:01.00]The manhole.
[42:01.96]It's just there.
[42:06.27]Is there no other way to go down?
[42:09.81]Pile shovel acquired.
[42:13.02]Favorite food at the State Fair.
[42:14.50]Let's go around and ask.
[42:16.08]What is your guys' favorite food at the State Fair?
[42:18.89]Zeppole.
[42:21.19]Okay.
[42:21.31]You know what a Zeppole is?
[42:22.35]I do not.
[42:23.70]Okay.
[42:24.84]What is it?
[42:25.96]It's like fried dough with powdered sugar on it.
[42:30.11]Okay.
[42:31.17]Fried dough is amazing?
[42:32.93]Yeah, that kind of thing.
[42:33.83]I love fried Oreos, too, but I think I might like a Zeppole more.
[42:36.76]How about you?
[42:38.38]I'm a street meat.
[42:41.77]Usually there's a sausage, peppers, and onions.
[42:44.99]Italian sausage and peppers and onions.
[42:47.82]Jarmo, listen up and listen closely.
[42:49.56]I like them thin, though.
[42:50.38]I like the links to be thin.
[42:53.12]The Feast of San Gennaro is happening right now in New York City and Little Italy, and they have the street meat with the sausage and peppers and the trucks.
[43:02.00]Yep.
[43:03.02]And I went and got one.
[43:04.72]Oh, how was it?
[43:06.17]Oh, my God.
[43:08.39]Describe it to me.
[43:08.95]Explain how it smelled.
[43:10.09]Describe it to me.
[43:10.59]I'm just saying it was the best thing ever.
[43:12.43]It was kind of watery.
[43:13.50]It was like a bunch of juices all over it.
[43:14.86]And it was covered in onions, like really caramelized onions and peppers.
[43:19.14]You have time still.
[43:20.05]You can book a flight now.
[43:24.25]Dasani water.
[43:25.07]Dasani water.
[43:29.30]Dude, I keep going.
[43:29.84]I'm teleporting back.
[43:30.88]I don't care.
[43:36.18]How about you, Ster?
[43:37.44]So we know Poke likes Dasani water.
[43:39.56]What do you like at a street fair?
[43:42.45]I haven't been at a street fair in a long time, but I could go for a funnel cake.
[43:46.97]Mmm, funnel cake.
[43:48.73]Good dude.
[43:50.06]That is a top choice right there.
[43:55.64]Ster, I don't believe that came from the heart.
[43:57.73]I think someone in your chat said it and you're like, you know what?
[44:01.48]Yeah.
[44:01.62]No, I love funnel cakes.
[44:02.86]It's just, it's been so long.
[44:04.42]It felt like sad to say it because I haven't had one in years.
[44:08.33]So if it's like, that's my favorite and I've been denying myself my favorite for, you know, like I was just a little sad.
[44:13.98]Oh my God.
[44:17.30]One pixel fell on my screen.
[44:19.25]That's the second time today I've scared the shit out of you.
[44:21.63]I'm so sorry.
[44:27.34]you actually just jumpscared the fuck out of me son this is uranium down here couldn't be me picking up the huge diamond how much did you get for it is there a tp here not yet but it's you know the hole is right there so it's not so bad you just jump down
[44:54.11]Next time the screaming will come up, I'll just think about it and be like, yeah.
[45:00.00]You can do whatever you want, man.
[45:02.52]Just don't drink Dasani water at a street fair.
[45:04.65]You can do better than that.
[45:06.31]What about ice cream related?
[45:11.40]Dippin' Dots.
[45:12.74]Dippin' Dots are so good.
[45:14.14]I'm crazy about Dippin' Dots.
[45:15.71]What else are you crazy about?
[45:18.61]Crazy?
[45:18.97]I was crazy once.
[45:22.91]He's got a $30,000 uranium diamond.
[45:26.36]Have you tried the rolled ice cream?
[45:28.60]It's great, yeah.
[45:29.88]It's pretty good.
[45:31.15]Yeah, Dippin' Dots are okay, but I like, you know, I've said it before, my favorite dessert is kind of like hot brownie with fudge on it, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream.
[45:42.00]That's like the best dessert I've ever had.
[45:43.62]That is awesome, too.
[45:45.31]Vinny, we are making a lot of money down here.
[45:48.09]I think the best dessert you can get, creme brulee.
[45:53.40]Oh, creme brulee, yeah.
[45:55.94]A good cheesecake though, a good, like a strawberry or raspberry blueberry cheesecake, I think is pretty high up there as well.
[46:04.39]There's a bakery that does like a cheesecake in a cone of caramelized stuff.
[46:14.14]I don't know what it is, it's good.
[46:16.48]Actually, I fucking... We talked about this cheesecake.
[46:19.90]I love a cheesecake, but you all wouldn't agree with me that cheesecakes are pies.
[46:25.35]Well, that's not really what we said.
[46:29.38]Where do you refill your battery?
[46:31.04]Your battery.
[46:32.80]The guy who you sell stuff to.
[46:34.96]You also can... If you hit Q, you have the radar.
[46:37.41]They show up on the radar.
[46:41.67]Dude, I fucking died.
[46:43.06]Oh my god, what killed you?
[46:45.01]The dynamite.
[46:46.37]What?
[46:48.13]I got killed by dynamite.
[46:49.30]My own dynamite.
[46:50.16]Dynamite?
[46:50.96]I... Dude, I threw a dynamite at me and Ster as a player.
[46:54.32]I only have 36 seconds left in my battery?
[46:56.93]Oh, no.
[46:57.21]That swings.
[47:00.21]And it has like a Dark Souls You Died screen.
[47:04.49]I threw dynamite at Ster and it didn't do anything.
[47:06.84]That's interesting.
[47:07.42]That's weird.
[47:08.88]Yeah, I don't know.
[47:09.46]I found a secret.
[47:10.66]Only yourself.
[47:11.84]What do you got over there, Poke?
[47:12.98]Poke, everything down here is secret.
[47:14.95]The emote shop.
[47:18.63]I got so much money.
[47:19.45]I might just teleport back.
[47:21.42]I gotta pee really bad.
[47:23.04]I do too, but I can't leave.
[47:24.18]I'm too enthralled by this game of the year.
[47:30.57]I'm doing it.
[47:31.65]I'm doing it right here.
[47:34.70]Oh, look at this.
[47:36.50]Where did you find the emote shop?
[47:42.42]Yeah, where is this emote shop?
[47:48.29]There's a bunch of stuff.
[47:49.29]Okay.
[47:50.71]Damn it.
[47:52.33]Uh, we are really far down here.
[48:00.14]My backpack is too full, so I can't even dig down.
[48:01.97]There's stuff on the way.
[48:05.51]Yeah, they said there's a balance patch coming for that.
[48:08.81]I didn't know.
[48:11.02]Dude, over there, over there.
[48:12.20]What do you mean over there?
[48:13.01]Did I miss something?
[48:21.16]Looks like someone's going to have to come in and pick up all of these diamonds then.
[48:24.43]Yeah, it's true.
[48:29.12]The next teleporter, I'm going back.
[48:35.93]Are you digging to the Banandium route?
[48:38.61]This is actually just the plot of Donkey Kong Bonanza.
[48:42.60]So if you guys, like, I know, Ster, you don't have a Switch 2 because you're probably smart.
[48:48.91]Can we just get a Switch 2 for Ster for, like, his birthday or something?
[48:53.01]Well, when we have the auction.
[48:54.57]It was recently, so you're gonna have to wait a year.
[48:57.35]Can we just get Ster a Switch 2 for his birthday?
[48:59.26]Like, the three of us.
[49:03.54]I want to do Mario Party Jamboree.
[49:08.18]I'll contribute $10.
[49:15.15]Can you buy me a PS5?
[49:16.47]Don't you?
[49:17.81]You just trying to... Do you want a PS5?
[49:20.70]You already have a PS5.
[49:26.55]Yeah, the TNT blows.
[49:27.97]He needs a PS5 Pro, though.
[49:33.68]Not wrong.
[49:35.26]Make sure you guys are picking up the batteries and all the other spare parts and stuff.
[49:49.52]Was there no teleporter down here?
[49:51.66]Oh, man.
[49:52.44]It's just a chest.
[49:53.37]Not yet.
[49:54.13]Do you have a teleport?
[49:57.55]I don't see one.
[49:59.35]We're deep, too.
[50:00.41]This is kind of crazy.
[50:01.32]I mean, I have teleporters.
[50:02.40]I just don't want to use them.
[50:05.71]Guess I'll just go this way.
[50:14.34]Diggy diggy hole.
[50:16.32]Diggy diggy hole.
[50:17.42]I gotta go back.
[50:20.26]I gotta go back.
[50:20.88]I'm out.
[50:23.19]I have so much money.
[50:24.53]Wasn't that the song?
[50:26.23]That's the the song.
[50:28.03]They stopped making them for a little bit after that one came out.
[50:30.38]They're like, well...
[50:32.49]what songs yeah they stopped making them well they said diggy diggy hole is like kind of the best there is so why we're kind of done remember the GTA 4 song eins wein rein or something remember that no no okay never mind alright time to go back down yay
[50:59.49]can't pick any of this up whoa that was a 15k ruby because I'm a gummy bear oh that song too oh big huge ruby
[51:20.02]Wish my goddamn backpack wasn't full.
[51:23.51]I think the strat for this game is to come in when the circle's closing and third party a team that hasn't been able to pick up all the diamonds yet.
[51:32.52]Remember when that was the game everyone was playing?
[51:35.68]What game?
[51:37.42]Any of them.
[51:37.93]PUBG.
[51:42.23]It was a weird time.
[51:43.31]It was a weird time because it was like one Battle Royale after another and then Among Us.
[51:49.25]Then there was, um, what was the game that was, like, obstacle course with, like, bean dudes?
[51:54.98]What was that one?
[51:56.62]It's pissing me off that there's been no Power Stone creator tournament.
[52:01.53]It's, like, just annoying.
[52:04.83]Let's play Power Stone.
[52:08.23]Is it a fighting game?
[52:09.86]One of the best fighting games ever made.
[52:11.14]I used to love that game growing up, but no one had a Dreamcast.
[52:14.80]Didn't Power Stone have, like, an adventure mode or no?
[52:19.20]Not really.
[52:20.59]It was a pretty traditional fighting game, but not traditional how it played.
[52:24.94]Well, we're in hell.
[52:26.02]Whoa.
[52:28.24]Oh.
[52:29.08]Is there a sewer?
[52:30.83]Dinosaur.
[52:34.02]Hourstorm is the game where you fight in a 3D environment.
[52:38.97]And you get power-ups, right?
[52:40.47]Yeah, there's a bunch of items and power-ups, but these diamonds, these little gems are on all over the place, and if you pick up three of them, you can hold three.
[52:48.80]When you pick up the third one, you go super mode, and each character is a different crazy mode, and you can knock gems out of the other characters that you're playing against.
[52:57.97]So it's very fun.
[52:59.75]It's probably the best fighting game ever.
[53:02.13]And, um...
[53:04.28]Somebody's got to get this bone.
[53:06.38]How many of these have you played?
[53:09.38]Enough of them.
[53:11.49]You guys know about Guns Online?
[53:13.67]You ever hear about that game?
[53:14.81]Yeah, it was like Matrix.
[53:16.56]Yeah.
[53:17.42]Yep, I played a lot of it.
[53:18.40]It was free.
[53:19.32]Yeah.
[53:20.08]It's coming back on Steam.
[53:21.97]Beta.
[53:22.51]The original or a new one?
[53:24.75]It's like... I don't know.
[53:26.17]I have no idea, actually.
[53:26.97]I think it's like... You were telling me about this like two weeks ago.
[53:30.10]You still don't know?
[53:31.93]I don't know.
[53:32.66]It's always a third party.
[53:34.60]I doubt the original guys were back.
[53:38.62]But yeah, no.
[53:39.57]I'm excited about that.
[53:40.77]We're at diamond level.
[53:45.77]I think we're getting close to the end of the game.
[53:48.34]My finger's getting broken.
[53:52.04]From dicking?
[53:53.75]I'm clicking in that game.
[53:54.97]Alright.
[53:56.03]Game console tier list.
[53:58.64]You can do your top five game consoles or handhelds that have ever come out.
[54:02.77]I'll start.
[54:04.64]We're going to round it out.
[54:07.27]Stop talking.
[54:08.63]We're going to round it out with the SEGA CD at number five.
[54:13.26]The 3DO at number four.
[54:16.76]The, uh, Super Nintendo at number one.
[54:24.25]The... Dude, that's a weird order.
[54:28.32]Number two, we're going to, we got the, um, we got the N64 at number two.
[54:35.83]Hmm.
[54:36.46]And coming in at third place, we have the... What do I want to put there?
[54:43.51]Super Nintendo N64, SEGA CD 3DO.
[54:49.46]And... This is important.
[54:52.84]You have to get this right.
[54:53.97]Otherwise, we will disown you.
[55:02.86]I'm going to go with...
[55:09.39]You know what?
[55:10.53]I'm going with the PS2 at number three.
[55:14.27]Wow.
[55:14.83]Super Nintendo, N64, PS2, SEGA CD, 3DO.
[55:18.84]Best five consoles ever made.
[55:20.10]Those are the best five consoles ever made.
[55:23.88]We need a visual.
[55:25.24]Question.
[55:25.98]Is nostalgia attached to how much you liked it, though?
[55:31.41]Yeah, I think so.
[55:34.89]Well, I don't know if I can count it, then.
[55:37.86]Yeah, that's tough.
[55:38.48]I don't know.
[55:41.50]He's going off nostalgia and not metrics, so I really don't know.
[55:47.57]Dreamcast would dropkick 3DO out if I didn't just play this 3DO a month ago.
[55:54.16]So, there you go.
[55:58.04]I never had a Dreamcast.
[56:01.03]This is not a great list from you.
[56:04.11]I wish I had a Dreamcast.
[56:05.72]I was thinking of putting the Wii at number three, but I played probably way more PS2 in my life and so many games I loved on PS2 than the Wii.
[56:14.87]My number one's gotta be PC.
[56:17.45]You're gonna be one of those guys?
[56:19.05]Exactly, he's one of those guys.
[56:22.34]Wow.
[56:25.86]Way too literal.
[56:27.39]There's such good shit on here, like fucking keep digging.
[56:32.73]He's right.
[56:33.07]He's got a point, guys.
[56:36.83]Vinny what's your favorite console super Nintendo yep well you said that it's an it's an assault okay okay so like top five one is pc uh two ios three android give us a real list not like the jokey one what's the real let's get to know Ster for real what are your top three consoles of all time
[57:03.60]uh it's all just nostalgia console like for an extended period of time in like 20 years
[57:14.65]It's like, okay, the list is what order did you grow up?
[57:17.75]I played the SEGA Genesis first.
[57:20.94]Yeah, I don't remember.
[57:21.56]That was a long time ago.
[57:23.36]That's not true.
[57:24.76]Super Nintendo, N64, and then I got a PS2.
[57:27.96]PS2 was so good because that's the one that I had.
[57:31.61]Did you have a... That's not true.
[57:34.13]It's... Give us the real list.
[57:37.89]I see what he's trying to say, though.
[57:39.44]He has a point.
[57:40.42]He has a point, but who's putting the SEGA CD in their fucking... Who had one of those?
[57:45.77]Like five people that I knew.
[57:48.46]You knew five people with that?
[57:50.44]No, not when I was growing up.
[57:52.05]That's crazy.
[57:53.41]I played the 3DO in my early 30s for the first time.
[57:58.09]are you on about yeah me too me too three uh 3dio and jaguar and like all those weirdo freak consoles were because of like stream bits and it turned out to be anyone that owned them growing up it turned out to be one of the most fun goofy here's okay let me let me fight you on this here's what I'm going to say about the SEGA cd and the 3dio the SEGA cd specifically and the video
[58:20.56]Stuff came out for those consoles that just would not come out for anything else.
[58:25.37]They made such goofy shit for the SEGA CD that... Like Wirehead?
[58:30.80]Yeah, the stuff that just wasn't on like PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2.
[58:34.46]Wow.
[58:34.75]I can't imagine why they didn't sell any of them.
[58:37.39]Wait, I think I had a SEGA growing up that you had to connect both, like two Segas together.
[58:42.36]Yeah, that whole thing was a mess.
[58:43.50]32X was terrible.
[58:44.16]You don't talk about SEGA shit.
[58:45.96]Yeah, there was a lot of messes in the SEGA camp.
[58:48.12]Oh my god.
[58:48.61]I hated it.
[58:49.39]The SEGA 32X had like eight games.
[58:54.59]Oh, and the power bank was massive, I remember.
[58:58.10]Am I crazy?
[59:00.00]Yes, it was.
[59:02.02]Dude.
[59:02.95]Oh, man.
[59:03.49]Did you turn that thing on?
[59:04.29]Your fucking lights flicker.
[59:06.87]Yeah.
[59:11.84]I never had a PlayStation.
[59:13.28]I had a PlayStation growing up, but when I was...
[59:16.20]I was not a Banjo-Kazooie guy.
[59:21.79]Oh, so you didn't like that console?
[59:23.67]No, no, no.
[59:24.15]Wait.
[59:24.84]No, wait.
[59:25.44]What's the other one?
[59:26.24]The PlayStation 1.
[59:27.10]Spyro?
[59:28.04]Crash Bandicoot?
[59:29.08]Crash Bandicoot.
[59:29.86]Yeah, my fault.
[59:30.65]Also, like, the Amiga was kind of interesting.
[59:33.99]You know, they did, like, a CD version.
[59:35.95]Yeah, I played some stuff on there, too.
[59:37.70]Um...
[59:38.04]they just made such an interesting games like stuff unlike you would ever find anywhere else and yeah even if it sucked it was so unique that I've played so many of these like there's a video I'm sure you have too these old SEGA cd 3DO amiga and they have this insane charm to them that is just unlike anything you've ever seen in your whole life I think the charm factor of those consoles outweighs their gameplay yeah the charm is important right
[60:04.30]Yeah, all the consoles have their own character sheet.
[60:07.14]Strength, charisma, intelligence.
[60:10.12]Come on, they all have their own sheets.
[60:11.48]The 3DO was like a 10 in charisma.
[60:16.71]Now the 3DO was like a 2 in intelligence and strength.
[60:27.54]Hello?
[60:28.70]Hello?
[60:31.90]my backpack is full I gotta go back but we don't have another teleport we might in a moment we might in a moment there's some teleports here uh we don't have teleport but I think there might be one right down there though yeah battery right there
[60:53.96]Guys, we found a vault.
[60:55.38]Holy shit.
[60:56.56]Which console was the cutest in its form factor?
[61:01.23]GameCube.
[61:01.63]Game Boy Advance SP.
[61:03.21]Oh, yeah, I love that.
[61:03.81]What the most attractive console was?
[61:05.44]Yeah, the Advance SP was the best, dude.
[61:08.44]It was a good one.
[61:09.62]I might get a little flack for this, but I think the SEGA Master System was a pretty attractive console.
[61:14.83]You're not getting any flack because no one knows what that looks like.
[61:18.31]I also think Dreamcast was an attractive console.
[61:24.99]Dreamcast was cool as fuck the controller.
[61:27.01]The Dreamcast controller was the coolest shit.
[61:30.08]It was we could put like a little Like a Tamagotchi on it.
[61:36.26]I think I'm gonna get some flack.
[61:37.86]Oh, yeah, the Xbox 360 amuse Totally disagree on Phil Spencer and that's crazy.
[61:51.82]Oh
[61:54.59]Oh man.
[61:56.43]The N64 was pretty attractive too.
[62:01.92]I loved it when I got it.
[62:02.98]Yeah, it was cool.
[62:04.71]I think the SEGA Genesis is like the ugliest console.
[62:11.04]Yeah, SEGA was weird vibes.
[62:14.14]A lot of them.
[62:15.30]Very strange looking consoles.
[62:16.91]Especially when you had to add the attachments to them.
[62:22.94]There's also the GBA Micro, which is like a keychain Game Boy Advance.
[62:26.65]I like that.
[62:28.10]Game Boy Advance is cool.
[62:29.34]Oh, I remember that one.
[62:30.14]That one was sick.
[62:31.05]Some like young friends.
[62:34.72]What does that mean?
[62:37.05]Why?
[62:37.53]Because you want people to say that the most attractive console is like the PS5?
[62:41.39]I don't know.
[62:42.25]Because that thing stinks, okay?
[62:44.18]I don't know what any of these things are.
[62:45.16]That thing is ugly.
[62:46.06]Yeah, and it doesn't sit well on its side.
[62:48.14]Sir, you really don't know?
[62:49.96]Sir, this is the wrong one.
[62:51.21]Dude, PS5 is the ugliest console ever.
[62:52.69]You don't know about the micro Game Boy, sir?
[62:56.37]The micro Game Boy?
[62:57.99]Yeah, they had a micro Game Boy that was black and white.
[63:00.70]No, it's Jerma over here.
[63:02.90]Oh, yeah, so the cutest one was the CP3PO.
[63:06.58]I said the SEGA Master System.
[63:08.20]He said that one time.
[63:10.53]Okay, one time.
[63:11.65]Yeah, one time.
[63:12.37]But the micro Game Boy is real.
[63:15.72]It's really cool.
[63:16.44]It's genuinely an awesome console, yeah.
[63:19.69]I think the PS5, genuinely, it's almost like they tried to make it look as awful as possible.
[63:26.30]Like, I don't know how they made it look so awful.
[63:28.66]I don't like it.
[63:29.18]I don't like it.
[63:29.52]It does not fit well in any configuration of my setup either, which might be my fault, but I really just didn't, yeah.
[63:36.43]Yeah, because if you want to put it on its side, you have to put those, like, plastic teeth on, and it doesn't sit on it well.
[63:41.82]It's just what was going on in that boardroom.
[63:44.14]Yeah, I don't really care about it.
[63:45.34]I don't care about it.
[63:48.92]You're just fucking seeing this monkey just like This has been this like the last 45 minutes of my screen Just monkey ass I'm enjoying this This has been the best moment
[64:06.97]How do we have the same idea Questioning it though, but we're we're almost.
[64:16.28]Oh my god.
[64:16.62]Look at the right.
[64:17.37]We're almost a thousand.
[64:19.01]I didn't notice that I May be doing a separate competitive hole because I couldn't find your hole Sir come to my hole When
[64:39.85]Me and sir was supposed to get creamed barbecue, but then we woke up and said, you know what?
[64:48.27]Fuck it.
[64:48.57]Let's just play deadlock What are you talking about getting creamed by Ricky?
[64:52.03]What does that mean?
[64:55.19]What?
[64:55.93]Who said that?
[64:56.83]That was my favorite console.
[64:57.99]You said me and Ster were supposed to get creamed by Ricky.
[65:01.56]Oh, I mumbled.
[65:02.64]Sorry, I need to drink water.
[65:03.82]Dude, just wait till you guys see.
[65:04.78]Me and Ster was gonna get some Korean barbecue.
[65:08.99]But we were so addicted to Deadlock.
[65:10.71]I see.
[65:11.39]So I couldn't hear myself talking because all this mining.
[65:14.24]Yeah.
[65:14.98]Do you guys hang in real life a lot?
[65:17.94]Well, we were going to, but then... Oh, I found the fucking Fallout vault.
[65:22.77]Am I ahead of you guys?
[65:24.36]Well, we got three people.
[65:25.75]It's hard.
[65:27.11]You didn't get to the Fallout vault yet?
[65:29.93]When I get really comfortable, I'll mumble.
[65:34.64]I'm almost out of battery.
[65:40.25]Battery?
[65:44.07]I'll 1v1 you, Poke.
[65:46.68]Where?
[65:47.34]In what?
[65:48.32]Korean BBQ.
[65:49.74]Oh, okay.
[65:51.19]Whoever eats more.
[65:54.79]Winner take all.
[65:59.41]I'm gonna puke in a second if we don't get to the bottom.
[66:04.38]You sounded like you were gonna puke.
[66:05.94]Just saying that.
[66:07.70]I believe him, guys.
[66:08.42]Stop throwing dynamite at us.
[66:12.29]My backpack's full.
[66:15.79]I swear I'm lagging.
[66:18.79]Yo!
[66:23.10]Chet, you saw that, right?
[66:25.97]Dude, you know what I'm doing?
[66:27.94]I'm... So Holly and I were... We're kind of talking about, like, our favorite video games ever.
[66:33.32]Like, what are they?
[66:34.02]Let's be real.
[66:35.95]And we started compiling a list of not just... They got top five favorite games.
[66:41.81]All the games that you would consider, like, amazing.
[66:45.60]And one day, what I want to do, when I have the total list of everything of my favorite things ever, I'm going to do a full tier list, putting all of my favorite video games ever against each other, and we'll see who the real winner is.
[66:57.65]Are you going to play them or just talk about them?
[67:01.39]That'd be a long ass thing.
[67:02.38]That'd be a long time.
[67:03.76]Yeah.
[67:06.84]But maybe I'll play some of them.
[67:09.55]Careful.
[67:10.09]Ooh, nice.
[67:11.93]Alright.
[67:12.23]We are at 945.
[67:12.97]P.M.?
[67:13.05]?
[67:25.53]No, sir.
[67:26.57]It is 9.59 p.m.
[67:27.45]Oh, it's close.
[67:29.85]It was a close, Jeremy.
[67:30.59]You're off a little bit.
[67:31.71]Is it even 1,000 meter depth?
[67:36.32]I did a tier list.
[67:37.94]Not a tier list.
[67:38.42]I did a top 100 of my favorite games like four years ago, five years ago.
[67:43.24]How did it go?
[67:45.07]It was good at the time, and I always say these lists will change.
[67:49.63]They always do.
[67:50.53]But I looked at it.
[67:52.73]again like a month ago and I'm like oh this sucks really it's good it wasn't that it sucked it was just that I'm like I put that there oh or I didn't include that so yeah it seems wrong to change but I'll I'll give you my top five consoles number one is super Nintendo number two is pc
[68:13.81]Oh, he's one of those guys.
[68:17.57]I'm not kidding, though, because Half-Life and Command & Conquer and Starcraft and Warcraft 3.
[68:21.97]That's true.
[68:23.41]If PC could have been included in my brain, it wasn't PC.
[68:27.14]PC would always be number one.
[68:29.60]I'll not include PC and I'll go next would be PS1, then N64, then PS2, then Switch.
[68:42.76]okay which really switch is making the top five the reason is it just has so much stuff on it and it's portable um otherwise I would probably go for a gba okay if that's good that's a good I think that's a good pick yeah I need one dollar
[69:15.85]I think a lot of the handhelds that people maybe sleep on is like a favorite console ever.
[69:19.78]Like the original DS is kind of insane.
[69:22.21]There's so much stuff on it.
[69:23.23]Yeah.
[69:24.57]Yeah.
[69:24.93]No, you're right.
[69:25.61]You're right.
[69:25.93]I fucking love that DS.
[69:29.84]Wait, how do you fill?
[69:31.10]And you can play Game Boy games.
[69:32.16]That's a problem though.
[69:33.07]Backwards compatibility.
[69:34.09]Whoever this is, they need to go to the doctor, by the way.
[69:37.55]If you count backwards compatibility, that changes the whole thing.
[69:41.50]The PS Vita, PSP.
[69:44.53]Yeah, PSP was kind of crazy, wasn't it?
[69:49.17]Oh, the fucking console for cats?
[69:56.50]What are they doing here?
[70:00.67]Wait, we're making $1,000 per minute.
[70:05.19]Yeah, from the workers.
[70:06.88]Only the host gets this money?
[70:10.55]Oh.
[70:11.89]That's kind of bullshit.
[70:14.47]Yeah, it's a little bullshit.
[70:16.40]Alright, so we made it to a thousand.
[70:17.64]There's a big vault to go in.
[70:18.84]That box had a hundred thousand dollars in it.
[70:21.54]That's how I'm keeping up with Vinny the Cheater.
[70:23.23]It was like, oh, let me host.
[70:24.91]Oh yeah, this is my favorite part.
[70:26.05]I've played this before.
[70:27.77]I'll host.
[70:28.92]I have no reason.
[70:30.38]Alright, so we're here.
[70:31.58]Are we ready to do the end game here?
[70:34.44]I think so.
[70:36.20]Wait, I'm coming.
[70:37.33]Unless we don't know if this is really endgame, or is it going to be... Land party, land party.
[70:44.64]There's spare batteries down here.
[70:46.44]Maybe there's a boss fight.
[70:51.93]Oh, shit.
[70:52.37]These computers, we can play Jackbox on these.
[70:57.32]Then more?
[71:02.45]but are we in like a don't look there's a button here guys we're playing abiotic it's like a bunker did you get to me and abiotic yet no Ster quit I blame him only Ster gives up on like oh here we go the big button now we're gonna press the big red button who wants to do the honors um only the host can press this button I'll do the honors
[71:34.48]Yeah.
[71:43.25]Did we just launch a missile?
[71:47.96]It's like one of those TikToks.
[71:49.84]If you were to put... Wow, so wait, you're telling me we dug straight down in a small cube where all you could do was dig down?
[72:00.74]I know, it's crazy.
[72:03.22]plot twist.
[72:04.42]How did we do that?
[72:05.60]No, something crazy is going to happen.
[72:06.98]When the camera gets to the top, we're going to find out some crazy shit.
[72:10.49]Like, we're not even on Earth right now.
[72:11.87]This is like a different planet.
[72:13.37]Oh, God.
[72:13.95]We had a real boring dig, didn't we?
[72:15.79]What kind of fucking hole is this?
[72:16.99]It was all just straight down.
[72:18.21]I think the game is implying... There's titans inside the wall?
[72:20.94]It's implying... Look at all your progress.
[72:23.96]Look at where you went.
[72:24.70]Ours is just literally a sink drain.
[72:27.62]We did straight down every time.
[72:30.95]Well, that's where you're supposed to go.
[72:35.74]We could have spelled out a whole sentence.
[72:42.53]Unless I have it.
[72:48.21]Okay, it's literally bombing us.
[72:52.52]No, but we're okay though.
[72:57.28]Yeah, because we're in the bunker.
[72:59.32]Oh.
[73:02.22]Okay.
[73:03.74]Oh, man.
[73:04.94]Okay, let's go again.
[73:05.90]Or merchant.
[73:10.93]One more time.
[73:11.91]Wait, where?
[73:13.33]Oh, you quit.
[73:14.97]You just insta-quit.
[73:18.84]Um, no.
[73:21.66]Just kind of did that on its own.
[73:23.77]Oh.
[73:25.99]I'm going to start up another one and see what's going on, and then we can switch to a different thing.
[73:30.03]That's fine.
[73:30.37]If you want to.
[73:33.06]I got to pee.
[73:34.00]Alright.
[73:36.47]It's pee time.
[73:37.93]Criken told me this was good, but Criken did.
[73:41.37]He said it was good.
[73:43.35]Okay, Criken.
[73:45.36]Like, did you say that as a joke?
[73:48.60]It was fun.
[73:49.20]His full name is Krakel.
[73:51.36]Okay.
[73:51.94]Call him by his full name.
[73:52.98]I'll be back.
[73:53.34]I'm going to pee.
[73:54.07]And you guys can go ahead and figure it out because you guys have been antagonistic to each other the whole day.
[73:58.37]So you two have to decide what we're doing.
[74:00.33]You're back.
[74:01.75]Alright.
