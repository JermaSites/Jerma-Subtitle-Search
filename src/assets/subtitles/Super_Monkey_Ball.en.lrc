[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.97]hello good afternoon everybody uh sorry I'm a little late again today but Otto seems to be on this uh new bathroom schedule where at 12 o'clock he's like I'm it's time I'm gonna go outside I have to go outside now it's like alright let's go so he's uh he's been on a different like pee and poo schedule
[00:31.43]Guess like clockwork.
[00:32.47]Yeah, actually though.
[00:34.09]But actually.
[00:38.54]Do I remember?
[00:39.30]Do I remember what?
[00:42.54]Wait a minute!
[00:44.06]The 21st day of September.
[00:46.65]Of course I do.
[00:50.71]I get it.
[00:51.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52.99]Oh shit, now I want to listen to that song on repeat for four hours.
[01:01.48]I do remember, yeah.
[01:05.28]Do it.
[01:05.64]I'm not gonna do that.
[01:06.44]That's not good content.
[01:09.24]That's painful.
[01:11.88]It's one of the best songs ever made.
[01:15.17]But that's... Nobody wants to hear the same song for the whole stream.
[01:19.03]It would be horrible.
[01:21.71]Do it once.
[01:22.37]I will.
[01:25.03]We're gonna play Super Monkey Ball today.
[01:26.41]It's been a long time coming.
[01:31.28]I'm ready.
[01:32.08]I've been told that this game is very fun.
[01:33.44]I've been told this game is very hard.
[01:34.60]Uh, the how to beat has this game at four and a half hours.
[01:40.76]So you can assume that I'll get stuck on like level four for about four hours.
[01:45.88]So it's probably going to be like an eight hour experience.
[01:54.01]Who beats this game first try in four and a half hours?
[01:56.87]I don't think anybody does that.
[02:00.89]Sometimes I'll look at like the how to be, I know it's an average, but then you'll look at kind of, you go down to the actual menu that shows the times.
[02:08.23]Like completionists, first timers, right?
[02:10.05]Can't you see that?
[02:10.59]How the fuck do people do that?
[02:14.93]Oh, Dark Souls.
[02:15.57]Yeah, I beat Dark Souls on my first attempt, my first playthrough in 18 hours.
[02:19.81]No, you didn't.
[02:23.04]You walked around the fucking swamp for four hours at least.
[02:26.68]In like Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3.
[02:28.96]How do you do that without a guide?
[02:33.65]Remember, that's normal.
[02:34.55]That's not normal.
[02:35.37]I should be playing Super Monkey Ball 2 or Deluxe.
[02:41.03]I'm really sorry to tell you.
[02:42.83]This is just Super Monkey Ball for the GameCube.
[02:49.35]I asked.
[02:50.03]I made it really clear.
[02:51.03]I said, hey, what version is like Super Monkey Ball 2, PC, Mac?
[02:56.43]And everyone screamed at me.
[02:57.29]They said, Super Monkey Ball for the Nintendo GameCube.
[02:59.89]Don't play anything else.
[03:00.65]And I was like, okay, fine.
[03:08.39]This is boo, it's not deluxe.
[03:11.29]Does it need to be deluxe?
[03:13.09]No, fuck deluxe.
[03:14.93]I don't want pepperoni, olives, onions, anchovies.
[03:17.85]I don't want that all over my pizza.
[03:19.69]Just give me the, like a pepperoni or like just pepper and onions.
[03:22.63]I don't want your deluxe pizza bullshit.
[03:29.98]That's too much stuff to put on a pizza.
[03:31.86]That's too much stuff to put in Super Monkey Ball, the original GameCube version.
[03:35.94]Let's go.
[03:37.62]Here we go.
[03:38.94]Here.
[03:39.12]Are you watching?
[03:40.40]Are you ready?
[03:45.51]Which says you're playing the one for Vita?
[03:48.81]What?
[03:51.87]Okay, okay.
[03:53.49]I looked over here.
[03:54.75]And I see that stream preview.
[03:57.37]I see a game called Hamster Ball.
[04:00.43]I was like, wait.
[04:01.80]That's not this.
[04:02.78]Is that the Vita?
[04:03.68]No, that's my title.
[04:06.85]It's Super Monkey Ball, not from PS Vita.
[04:10.56]Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.
[04:14.22]Shit.
[04:16.70]Super Monkey Ball.
[04:18.19]There it is, right?
[04:18.93]Refresh.
[04:24.31]What?
[04:24.67]I don't... Okay, I don't want it to be Banana Splits.
[04:26.93]How do I make it just a regular one?
[04:31.29]What the flying fuck is all this?
[04:34.23]Super Monkey Ball 2, Super Monkey Ball Ticket Blitz, Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, Sakura Edition, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz HD, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Splits, Super Monkey Ball 3D, Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll, Monkey Ball Junior, Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.
[04:49.70]How many games do they have?
[04:50.80]I thought there was two.
[04:57.50]Super Monkey Ball.
[05:01.05]I just clicked Super Monkey Ball, but it'll only do banana splits.
[05:12.82]What's going on here?
[05:13.46]Why is it doing that?
[05:15.88]I select Super Monkey Ball, and it goes banana splits.
[05:19.92]Is it fixed?
[05:21.66]Who cares?
[05:22.15]Let's go.
[05:23.98]It don't matter.
[05:24.44]If you see Super Monkey Ball in the title, just know that it's one of the apparently 15 fucking Jason movies this game has.
[05:32.78]Let's go.
[05:38.86]Super Monkey Ball.
[05:40.60]Shh.
[05:43.38]Main game, party game, minigame.
[05:44.80]Main game, right?
[05:45.68]Make sure to guide the monkeys in the balls to the goal as quickly as possible.
[05:50.10]There's no sound.
[05:51.43]Oops.
[05:51.63]Ha ha ha.
[05:55.15]We're good.
[05:57.48]I just played the game completely with no audio.
[06:00.42]Okay, main game?
[06:01.18]Yeah, main game.
[06:04.38]Normal, practice, or competition?
[06:06.04]Alright, let's do normal.
[06:10.80]This is definitely a SEGA game, I can already tell.
[06:12.46]It is, right?
[06:12.96]It's a SEGA game.
[06:15.34]That's the SEGA guy that talks after you touch stuff.
[06:19.14]I'm one player.
[06:21.81]Okay.
[06:22.97]I, I, me, me, baby, or gone, gone.
[06:26.43]Okay, I think it's gonna have to be baby.
[06:34.69]I, I, or... It's gonna be baby.
[06:36.49]It has to be.
[06:38.87]Wait, do they have powers?
[06:39.73]B, add X. Beginner, 10 stage.
[06:44.91]Advanced, 30 straight.
[06:45.73]50 stages?
[06:46.03]Let's do beginner first.
[06:51.13]Wait, hold on.
[06:51.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:52.01]I have a question.
[06:52.47]Is this like Mario Party?
[06:55.57]Where it's just adding more stages on top?
[07:00.49]Or are they completely different stages?
[07:04.70]So I gotta go through beginner first.
[07:07.54]They're all different.
[07:08.16]They're all different.
[07:08.60]They're all... Alright, let's go.
[07:10.94]I'm ready.
[07:13.08]So there are fucking like a hundred stages?
[07:14.86]Oh, well, this looks easy.
[07:19.10]Ready?
[07:19.67]Go!
[07:24.75]Alright, that was fun.
[07:26.49]So, it's like, it's like the, okay.
[07:28.92]Wait, it saves the replays?
[07:33.34]Banana 3 out of 100.
[07:34.12]You just gotta collect the bananas.
[07:43.39]Do I have an actual time limit or no?
[07:53.00]Yeah, I do.
[07:53.90]It's right there.
[07:56.28]Oh, my, like, audio is so fucked up.
[07:59.94]Watch the replay for a second.
[08:04.82]Why?
[08:05.26]I gotta get new... Okay, I swear to God.
[08:07.70]Go.
[08:08.42]Where is it?
[08:10.31]Oh, sick.
[08:11.19]This is cool.
[08:16.67]Yeah, yeah, alright.
[08:17.17]This is like playing Sonic, but you actually get to watch...
[08:24.08]Rather than go... Did I make it?
[08:31.60]Does it jump?
[08:32.52]How do I jump?
[08:36.48]Almost.
[08:40.02]There's no camera either.
[08:41.10]It's just whatever way you're going.
[08:42.42]Go.
[08:46.74]Okay, I almost puked.
[08:50.64]I got 40 seconds of plenty of time.
[08:55.11]Oh, shit!
[09:04.89]If you go fast, you'll bounce.
[09:11.22]Oh, it has a miles per hour.
[09:12.18]That's cool.
[09:14.88]Bonus floor!
[09:16.30]Collect all the bananas, right?
[09:23.65]I got time.
[09:25.11]That's why this is beginner.
[09:26.23]I get it.
[09:30.89]Shit, I'm doing such a bad job mowing the banana lawn.
[09:33.13]I can do better than this.
[09:40.42]They all have dull on them?
[09:43.78]Wait a minute.
[09:45.02]Is this a sponsored video game?
[09:48.22]Dull bananas.
[09:52.48]Alright, I got him.
[09:52.96]Now- Oh!
[09:58.48]Partially, yes.
[09:59.66]Oh no, this looks like it's a little more complicated.
[10:04.00]Okay, so this one is... How fast should I be going?
[10:09.45]You gotta take corners tight.
[10:14.09]Okay, this game's fun.
[10:15.50]I like this game very much.
[10:16.64]It's okay.
[10:19.88]It's alright.
[10:20.28]It's fine.
[10:20.60]It's fine.
[10:21.98]It's gonna happen at least once.
[10:29.84]Wait, do I have lives?
[10:33.02]Wait.
[10:34.62]When I run out of lives, do I run out of lives?
[10:37.48]Yes, but you know what I mean?
[10:38.61]Do I have to start over?
[10:46.45]You do.
[10:47.79]Wait.
[10:48.93]Oh, I missed one!
[10:51.63]No!
[10:55.25]I can't get it.
[10:55.89]I hate it.
[10:56.95]I hate that.
[10:58.31]I hate it.
[10:58.65]I have to get it.
[11:01.63]Whatever.
[11:03.01]That sucks.
[11:09.92]You can continue.
[11:10.84]Okay, that's good.
[11:12.98]Shit, can I go back and play that one again?
[11:14.46]Alright, how many bananas are here?
[11:19.18]What happens when I get a hundred bananas?
[11:21.59]Did I miss some back here?
[11:29.95]Get these.
[11:36.61]There we go.
[11:37.07]Okay, I gotta make this cleaner.
[11:38.95]No wonder I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[11:40.59]Ooh, that's a bunch!
[11:52.18]You definitely will need those lives, okay?
[11:55.34]Don't go on the goal yet, get it perfect.
[11:56.70]Perfect!
[12:08.40]Missed one.
[12:08.84]I'm good.
[12:11.50]Floor eight.
[12:11.94]Alright, we only have two more floors.
[12:14.52]Oh, this is bad.
[12:15.16]Okay.
[12:15.42]Let's do it slow.
[12:21.70]No!
[12:22.02]I don't know what I was thinking.
[12:30.50]I don't know what I was thinking.
[12:31.44]I thought I could go... I don't know.
[12:38.28]Holy shit.
[12:39.56]No, this is hard.
[12:40.36]I'm okay.
[12:48.49]It isn't.
[12:48.95]Yes, it is.
[12:49.41]Alright, I'm gonna wait.
[13:03.08]Or baby monkey.
[13:04.76]You are on the dole.
[13:06.38]What?
[13:07.20]What do you mean I'm on the dole?
[13:09.94]What does that mean?
[13:16.85]Should I go?
[13:19.99]I'm not gonna go.
[13:20.43]I'm not gonna go.
[13:20.77]I'm gonna wait.
[13:25.47]Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[13:27.95]Stop rolling. Stop rolling. Stop rolling. Stop rolling.
[13:29.67]Don't.
[13:31.04]How much time do we have?
[13:32.16]15 seconds?
[13:36.08]I know I'm going.
[13:41.38]But then is it just for lives?
[13:42.94]Yeah, but you have to get them.
[13:47.90]Okay.
[13:49.30]Floor nine.
[13:50.16]This one looks cool.
[13:53.32]This one just dumps you down there.
[13:54.48]Alright, don't go that fast.
[14:06.75]What?
[14:08.13]You received 228 play points.
[14:09.99]You now have a total of 228 play points.
[14:13.70]I'm gonna go again.
[14:14.22]What do you mean sad?
[14:20.60]Why is that sad?
[14:21.34]I'm just my first time playing Super Monkey Ball 3D!
[14:24.52]Are you fucking kidding me?
[14:35.39]This isn't 2D.
[14:37.85]How did I fuck that up?
[14:38.81]I don't even know.
[14:39.23]I don't know how I messed that up.
[14:40.31]I don't know.
[14:51.67]Oh my fucking god.
[14:55.35]Why?
[14:55.77]I need some coffee.
[14:57.55]I gotta get coffee.
[14:58.51]Let me get a- Let me drink some coffee for a second.
[15:00.17]Just wait.
[15:04.19]Okay.
[15:07.71]Come on.
[15:15.37]That's some good cider.
[15:16.51]Stop.
[15:19.75]Here we go, line it up.
[15:23.81]Okay, fine.
[15:24.53]That took way longer than it should've.
[15:31.52]This is it.
[15:32.48]Final floor of beginner.
[15:33.82]This is to teach you how to play.
[15:41.04]Oh, thank god there's bumpers.
[15:46.38]I wish I could turn the camera just a little.
[15:48.00]I think I'll be fine on this one.
[15:52.74]I'm not gonna fall.
[15:53.24]Alright, this one has divots.
[15:58.37]Okay, I thought my chair was just shaking too at the same time.
[16:05.81]I was just rolling down the stairs in my chair.
[16:11.61]Oh, God damn it.
[16:12.93]Just no.
[16:17.69]I can't even fucking... Don't say hurry up.
[16:30.16]Don't listen to them.
[16:30.90]Just go normally.
[16:31.68]Do normal, normal, normal.
[16:32.82]I'm fine.
[16:41.48]Stop.
[16:42.72]Alright, I got here with 30 seconds the last time.
[16:44.74]I got plenty more time.
[16:48.56]Good.
[16:52.20]Alright, line this up.
[16:53.04]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[17:01.77]No.
[17:02.83]This is hard.
[17:03.97]This is very tricky.
[17:05.05]It's tricky.
[17:07.80]Okay, do you guys know that game where you have the marble and that little plastic device and you have to tilt it around and put it inside of the hole in the middle of the little device?
[17:16.53]I was never any good at that.
[17:17.49]I always freaked the fuck out.
[17:19.07]I always went over it, went over it, went over it, went too hard, went too hard, went too hard, went too soft, and then I would just throw the thing in the trash.
[17:26.96]Like, who even cares?
[17:38.75]That's not going to impress anybody.
[17:40.55]All that does is it just takes an annoying time to get that right.
[17:48.41]If you show somebody you do that, they just go, oh yeah, I also one day was a fucking asshole and spent 45 minutes trying to get a ball in the middle of a hole.
[18:14.71]He hates this.
[18:17.47]You know what's funny?
[18:18.33]When I was just being annoyed, I almost did the whole thing in one go.
[18:25.44]I can't focus.
[18:26.24]I don't want to focus on this.
[18:27.46]Games like this, if I don't focus, I do better.
[18:30.06]Give me a topic right now.
[18:32.62]Give me a topic.
[18:39.73]Oranges.
[18:42.01]No, oranges are gross.
[18:45.33]I'm one of those people that thinks that oranges are gross.
[18:46.95]I actually like clementines though.
[18:48.27]Because clementines are exactly what you want.
[18:50.68]You want just a little bit of orange.
[18:52.52]They're not gonna get slimy.
[18:53.54]They don't have all that weird white film on them.
[19:00.23]You can peel them so easily.
[19:02.59]Alright, didn't work.
[19:03.99]It didn't work.
[19:04.61]It didn't work.
[19:05.49]It didn't work.
[19:05.89]Just relax.
[19:06.87]I'm gonna get it right now.
[19:18.53]This is beginner.
[19:19.57]Great.
[19:20.41]Can't wait.
[19:20.77]This is gonna be good.
[19:21.95]How long has it been?
[19:22.63]20 minutes?
[19:24.24]Okay.
[19:24.54]That's like long.
[19:26.78]That's like a good, like, meaty stream, right?
[19:29.30]20 minutes?
[19:33.00]How long is the Joe Rogan podcast?
[19:35.27]Like, 40 minutes?
[19:36.15]Alright.
[19:36.93]Well, I'm good.
[19:41.71]A computer just crashed.
[20:04.47]I'm good.
[20:05.97]That was really weird.
[20:06.87]My computer just hard crashed.
[20:08.81]Like, it was hanging.
[20:14.22]Exposed.
[20:14.74]What do you mean exposed?
[20:15.60]I only got 14 seconds!
[20:19.68]Hey, you guys got to acclimatize.
[20:20.80]I like how you can peel them with your hands.
[20:22.62]They're much, much softer than a regular orange.
[20:25.56]If you agree with me, give me a fucking retweet.
[20:27.57]Yes!
[20:40.92]It really is an ad.
[20:43.78]You got 100 points all together, you have 357 points.
[20:48.51]Only 2143 points left to un-walk the next mini-game.
[21:01.12]You remember when people used to try to pay me to talk like that?
[21:03.58]I just did that for free.
[21:08.34]What's this?
[21:13.99]Oh, this is cool.
[21:22.05]It's like Sonic.
[21:22.71]If you touch anything, you lose them.
[21:30.71]Okay, so nobody can say I didn't beat Super Monkey Ball.
[21:33.69]We're not talking about difficulty.
[21:34.63]We're just talking about completion.
[21:37.09]None of you can say I didn't do it.
[21:43.07]Super Monkey Ball.
[21:45.69]I can't believe there are this many.
[21:47.13]I really can't.
[21:48.88]I was always under the assumption that there was two.
[21:51.70]That there was one for the GameCube and then one for the iPad that nobody liked.
[21:55.64]Or Dreamcast.
[21:57.59]I always thought that Dreamcast came out with one and then they came out with one like a remake for the GameCube.
[22:16.02]It's your high score here, huh?
[22:22.89]The iPad fucking sucks.
[22:23.79]Alright, can I skip this?
[22:33.13]I know everyone's gonna be mad if I do, but can I?
[22:41.95]Just quit back to menu.
[22:43.52]Well, let me just see how much I can get on my first run.
[22:49.24]Skip it.
[22:50.40]I can't!
[22:54.56]There's no skipping!
[22:59.58]It's a forced cutscene, guys.
[23:01.06]I can't skip it.
[23:05.16]We're almost done.
[23:11.59]Look in the credits.
[23:16.29]You're losing bananas.
[23:20.06]Alright, how about this?
[23:21.14]Whatever I have for a total banana count at the end is how many community subs I will give.
[23:24.43]How's that sound?
[23:38.18]That sounds good to me.
[23:48.00]I hope we're not near the end of the credits Watch it roll, it's over now How many do I have to- how many do I owe so far?
[24:06.21]Oh shit!
[24:09.45]Oh fuck, I'm hitting things
[24:16.95]Oops.
[24:17.97]Oh, doe crap.
[24:22.60]Oh, no.
[24:28.60]I really don't.
[24:29.14]Hold on.
[24:30.62]I don't want to give, like... Wait, wait, wait.
[24:32.86]What does that mean?
[24:33.90]What does that mean?
[24:34.58]What does that mean?
[24:36.02]Minus... Wait, that's how many subs I get now.
[24:41.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:41.88]You're gonna turn... You're gonna twist that on me somehow.
[24:45.77]Dude, twist that on me.
[24:46.37]I gotta get it to zero.
[24:49.98]You guys are gonna twist it.
[24:50.78]You'll be like, no, no, dude, because you went negative, now it's like you've minused.
[24:55.16]You have to, like, deduct those subs into our account.
[25:01.04]Let's just stay at fucking zero.
[25:02.60]It's going -2.
[25:13.38]Come on, perfectly balanced is how things should be.
[25:19.02]Shit, I'm really not trying to hit this thing.
[25:22.92]I'm really trying to get it to... Oh, no.
[25:26.64]No, it doesn't go the other way.
[25:28.10]I didn't make that.
[25:28.76]I gotta make that really clear.
[25:31.80]Let's be very clear here.
[25:34.18]No, it doesn't matter if it goes negative.
[25:35.76]It doesn't mean anything.
[25:42.41]No, I don't wanna.
[25:43.63]I don't wanna.
[25:44.05]There's the goal.
[25:46.19]Alright, come on.
[25:46.83]Perfectly balanced.
[25:47.33]That's the goal.
[25:47.75]Things should be...
[25:59.37]Okay, oh wait.
[26:01.13]Fuck you, no.
[26:04.85]That doesn't mean anything.
[26:11.36]That's one, two, three.
[26:13.58]I went minus one, two, three.
[26:18.81]I was just trying to get to dash one, two, three.
[26:22.61]It's not 123, unsubs.
[26:23.03]Oh shit.
[26:28.19]123 of you guys have to unsub, that's not good.
[26:35.80]No, no, but wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, wait, let, don't do, don't, let's not, let, don't get too hasty here, because what's gonna happen is, like, any, remember, okay, if I say press 1 in the chat, hey, 10 of you press 1 in the chat, 2,000 of you are gonna press 1 in the chat.
[26:48.80]If I say, oh, 100 of you, 100 of you need to unsub, 5,000 of you are gonna unsub.
[26:55.61]Let's not get too hasty there.
[26:57.86]Don't get too hasty there.
[27:04.16]What's this want me to do?
[27:11.87]Oh.
[27:13.95]I don't care.
[27:14.39]Enter your name.
[27:17.07]That's my name.
[27:17.57]Done.
[27:28.68]If you don't unsub, you're encouraging bad behavior.
[27:31.30]Don't do that.
[27:32.06]What you're talking about, you're going over, you are messing with things that you are not to mess with.
[27:38.58]What do people, what's like the villain say in the movie when things are too powerful?
[27:42.59]You're messing with forces that you do not know.
[27:44.81]Something like that, right?
[27:56.53]Alright, should we stay with the... Let's go Mimi.
[27:58.37]We'll do advanced.
[28:02.04]I thought you guys said that it wasn't just packed on levels.
[28:19.48]Wait, somebody just gave 100 subs.
[28:21.53]Wait, hold on.
[28:22.11]Somebody... Zombie Eater just gave 100 community subs.
[28:31.00]That's a lot.
[28:31.88]That's a shitload of subs.
[28:32.88]Thank you for the hundred subs.
[28:36.12]Okay, now those hundred people delete them.
[28:38.74]Like, just take off your sub.
[28:41.28]Right after getting it.
[28:42.66]Don't do that, though.
[28:43.82]Come on.
[28:44.46]Money.
[28:44.64]You know what I mean?
[28:45.68]Like, money.
[28:48.36]Mini golf course.
[28:52.58]Okay, 100 from... Hold on.
[28:55.80]100 from Zombie Eater and 23 from Phylactery Lich.
[28:58.34]You guys are fucking crazy.
[29:02.91]Thank you, both of you.
[29:03.69]That's an extreme amount of money.
[29:05.11]How did I not get those?
[29:15.80]Got it.
[29:16.06]Okay, good.
[29:20.08]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[29:22.22]I... I didn't even know that's what they did.
[29:29.01]I don't know the game mechanic.
[29:31.25]And by the way... Stupid game mechanic, by the way.
[29:33.65]That wasn't even... That wasn't me.
[29:37.21]That was the game mechanics.
[29:38.13]Got it.
[29:48.86]Bad because bad.
[29:49.76]Mad because bad.
[29:50.62]But no, seriously, that's fucking hundreds of dollars, guys.
[29:53.02]We joke around, but that's a lot of money.
[29:59.68]Thank you!
[30:07.93]He's moving my rubber duckies around.
[30:12.15]I'm the number one streamer that streams in a bathtub.
[30:17.59]Oh shit.
[30:18.81]Okay, that's not what I wanted.
[30:29.23]I don't care about bananas.
[30:30.01]I care about completion.
[30:32.09]I didn't get any, but I don't care.
[30:35.09]Do you care?
[30:35.75]Do you actually care?
[30:37.03]I don't.
[30:39.91]I care about completion.
[30:40.75]Okay.
[30:48.22]I'm just holding up.
[30:50.10]Didn't move fast enough.
[30:50.93]Never mind.
[30:57.11]You received 69 play points.
[30:58.51]You now have a total of 426 play points.
[31:04.17]What are the party games you can unlock?
[31:05.76]That seems kind of fun.
[31:07.72]Alright, I'm going to wait and go now.
[31:18.66]Just a minute.
[31:19.14]It's going to be like five minutes.
[31:27.72]Come on, hurry up.
[31:30.51]Go back!
[31:39.47]Can I do this in one go?
[31:40.65]I can!
[31:56.66]Imagine there being a casino minigame.
[32:00.35]Is that your way to tell me that there's a casino minigame in this?
[32:05.27]Is that the way you're gonna let me know?
[32:09.76]Do I get to bet my dull bananas?
[32:12.56]Like a slot machine?
[32:17.12]Ah, I see.
[32:17.62]Okay.
[32:18.41]I'm seeing the grins.
[32:23.66]This is the most inefficient way to fucking do this level.
[32:25.82]It's unbelievable.
[32:26.52]I almost didn't make it either.
[32:36.97]Each time you fall... You... You what?
[32:42.99]Bonus spoiler.
[32:43.59]I'll get them all here.
[32:54.89]Spiral, just do a spiral.
[32:56.11]I don't have enough time.
[33:20.42]Sorry, I had to let all the air out of my body for a second.
[33:30.52]Okay.
[33:30.96]Good to know.
[33:37.98]You gotta wait.
[33:38.80]You know what?
[33:39.10]I think I have to go around the whole thing, right?
[33:41.54]You gotta wrap around.
[33:42.28]I don't know.
[33:45.10]What happened?
[33:45.96]I won?
[33:48.90]Oh.
[33:50.08]I'll take it.
[33:53.64]Oh, shit.
[33:54.24]This is a silly straw.
[33:55.28]I don't like this one.
[33:57.88]Oh, let me tell you guys something real quick.
[33:59.34]I bought this elaborate silly straw glasses thing where it was a big straw that wrapped around my whole body and went like up around my eyes as glasses.
[34:07.81]And I was gonna turn it on and like drink stuff out of it and, you know, I don't know, think it was funny.
[34:12.41]I snapped it in half accidentally because it was so brittle.
[34:15.79]I was setting up to do it.
[34:16.71]I was putting it all around my body and shit.
[34:19.55]And... What's wrong with my computer?
[34:22.91]I like need a new computer.
[34:29.06]My Windows is crashing.
[34:32.00]What the fuck is happening?
[34:44.14]Shit.
[34:51.99]Why?
[34:52.91]He's getting hacked.
[34:53.99]I'm not getting hacked.
[35:03.07]What happened?
[35:07.07]Oh, fuck.
[35:08.23]That's not good.
[35:10.41]That's not good.
[35:12.93]That's not good.
[35:18.15]I swear to God, every time I download a Windows update, my computer gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[35:23.92]It's like I'm taking my car to the mechanic.
[35:27.50]And every time I go to the mechanic, he unscrews something else.
[35:36.65]Hey, man, can you replace my windshield wiper fluid?
[35:39.97]Yeah, I sure can.
[35:41.53]And he puts a little bit of windshield wiper fluid in and unscrews something underneath.
[35:46.71]And then I come in to ask him, hey, I'm hearing a rattling.
[35:48.92]Let me check that out.
[35:50.16]And he opens it up and he just pees in the gas tank or something.
[35:54.94]Hey, man, my gas tank smells like pee.
[35:56.78]Yeah, well, let me fix that.
[35:59.16]And he pees in the wiper fluid.
[36:02.86]He takes a hammer to the taillight.
[36:06.57]Like, every time I get a Windows update, my computer gets worse!
[36:10.93]My computer just gets worse every time I download one.
[36:13.62]And there's been a bunch of them lately.
[36:14.82]Like, I caught up.
[36:21.76]I caught up.
[36:23.30]Okay, let's go.

[36:57.78]He's like, hey, what's the button combination to save a state?
[37:00.28]And I was like, I don't fucking know.

[41:35.19]Hold on.
[41:35.71]I'm busy.
[41:36.23]I can't just click any link that pops up in the chat.
[41:40.29]I have to play Super Monkey Ball HD Remake.
[41:44.81]Speaking of HD Remakes, holy shit, Demon's Souls looks insane.
[41:48.11]Demon's Souls looks so completely different that...
[41:55.35]It's like, it's going to be like playing a whole new video game.
[41:59.97]Even though I've already played through it within the last couple of years.
[42:02.81]Well, the last two or three years or so.
[42:04.83]It don't matter.
[42:06.79]It's going to be like Dark Souls 4.
[42:07.93]I really thought I was going to get that one.
[42:18.42]Yeah, this game is fun as hell.
[42:19.28]Alright, I'll click the link.
[42:21.92]Hold on, just give me a second.
[42:28.97]What is it?
[42:31.37]The Chuck E. Cheese thing?
[42:32.52]Yeah, I saw this.
[42:38.06]Charles Entertainment Cheese.
[42:40.06]But it's not.
[42:40.91]Where is it?
[42:54.17]That's kind of scary.
[42:57.40]That's huge.
[43:03.98]It's too big!
[43:10.07]Ah!
[43:10.69]Go smaller!
[43:12.29]There we are.
[43:15.41]Jux BFF.
[43:21.96]Too big, too big.
[43:26.91]That's pretty cool, yeah.
[43:29.21]That's a cool image that somebody has made of me.
[43:31.84]That's not... That's not me.
[43:38.41]Hey, you know that guy Dave we talked about?
[43:41.29]The powerful senator from fucking, I don't know, whatever state.
[43:44.79]He also said that he was having like graphical problems in his game.
[43:48.79]He's texting me right now.
[43:50.49]He's spamming me.
[43:52.07]And he's saying, hey, what the fuck, dude?
[43:54.31]I started saving my state, but then my graphics are all messed up.
[43:57.67]Fix it or your stream is over.
[43:59.52]I was like, dude, I'm working on it.
[44:04.04]So what should I do if that happens to Dave's computer?
[44:14.81]Tell him to stop breaking the law.
[44:17.87]Hey fellas!
[44:21.35]This guy wanted me to tell a senator to stop breaking or bending the law!
[44:27.42]Can you believe this guy?
[44:28.76]I hate these ones.
[44:42.76]I hate these ones.
[44:46.29]Those are too hard for me.
[44:49.54]This is on advanced.
[44:53.12]I think I can still pull it off.
[44:54.22]Well, hold on.
[44:54.66]Let me see.
[44:55.26]What's going on with my voice?
[44:56.20]Why am I turning it into this?
[45:00.35]I don't know why I'm like this now.
[45:02.11]I'm just going to beat the level because I don't care.
[45:07.35]Fuck the bananas.
[45:09.33]Fuck the bananas.
[45:10.11]Nobody cares about bananas anyways.
[45:12.36]They're radioactive, don't you know?
[45:17.52]This is water.
[45:18.30]Okay, that's going to hurt my head if I continue to look at that.
[45:26.40]Hey, I'm getting text.
[45:32.78]Hey, Jeremy, I got really... My aspect ratio in Swordfish 1, 2 is going crazy.
[45:45.20]Fix it.
[45:46.72]Okay, I think, uh, force four by three.
[45:48.68]I think that will help if you do, if you open up that program.
[45:51.16]Alright, I'll try.
[45:52.48]You little fuck.
[45:53.34]I think I'm just at this guy's mercy every day.
[46:03.79]Jeremy.
[46:06.55]Is it still safe to drink almond milk if it's two days after its expiration?
[46:11.53]You better fucking tell me.
[46:14.09]How do I end?
[46:19.19]We're unstoppable now.
[46:27.21]Oh fuck this level.
[46:50.12]What is this, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4?
[46:50.98]0.4.
[46:51.08]Just hold forward!
[46:54.62]Oh, that didn't work.
[47:01.59]That's the thickness?
[47:04.49]Oh, let's go with the fucking hardest one there is.
[47:06.37]You get more bananas.
[47:11.48]Oh, sick.
[47:12.28]It's good to even get... I failed the test.
[47:21.79]This is fun.
[47:22.35]Okay, I like this.
[47:23.03]I'm gonna stay here for a little bit.
[47:25.09]Line it up.
[47:30.72]It's impossible.
[47:31.44]It's not possible.
[47:35.98]You have to go fast.
[47:40.54]How would you go fast over this?
[47:48.21]Really?
[47:48.49]I have to go fast?
[47:52.34]No, I can't do it.
[48:04.79]Nope, I don't think it's possible.
[48:05.89]I don't think it's possible to do this.
[48:08.05]Also, I have to go straight.
[48:11.55]Yeah, I also have to go straight.
[48:12.67]That's right.
[48:13.83]You're right.
[48:15.05]But... Just balance Pepe left.
[48:19.90]I can't.
[48:20.36]I need the upgrade.
[48:24.54]Just go forward.
[48:28.97]Look at all those bananas too.
[48:30.28]This is awesome.
[48:58.06]Just do the easy one.
[48:59.46]I'll do point one.
[49:02.74]This is- you can't even go on them.
[49:04.54]You- they're covered in oil.
[49:14.31]Just do the easiest one.
[49:15.55]No, I can't do blue.
[49:17.43]I'll do green.
[49:22.78]I'm never gonna get out of this.
[49:23.74]I'm never gonna be able to do this.
[49:35.57]I won't be allowed.
[49:36.53]Alright, I'll do teal.
[49:38.75]That's my Jerma985 colors.
[49:40.25]It's fine.
[49:45.10]What?
[49:46.96]What the fuck?
[49:47.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[49:48.40]Did this just end?
[49:49.68]Let me see the map.
[49:53.68]Shit.
[49:56.57]Game over.
[49:57.07]What do you mean game over?
[50:19.65]Save state.
[50:20.91]No, save state.
[50:21.93]Give me a fucking break, guys.
[50:23.91]You think I'm some kind of asshole?
[50:25.57]No, I have six GameCubes lined up here, all the same level.
[50:29.88]Lined up in different parts of the game in case I get stuck.
[50:34.40]I have physical hardware save states.
[50:41.45]Is that okay?
[50:52.70]Okay, good.
[50:57.48]Blue, Omega Lull.
[50:58.75]Fuck, you're right.
[50:59.57]I'm gonna do it right.
[51:00.21]Oh my god, I can't even... What the hell is going on?
[51:15.61]Fell off... I didn't fall off the easy... I deliberately fell off the easiest one.
[51:20.04]My fingers are like sweating and cold and shit.
[51:28.60]My hands are sweating and cold.
[51:33.47]Why?
[51:33.83]How?
[51:34.53]Why does that happen to me?
[51:37.71]How can you be sweating and cold on your fucking hands?
[51:40.71]Ugh.
[51:41.85]Just rage already.
[51:44.87]No, why would I?
[51:45.85]I mean, of course it's a little frustrating to play.
[51:49.85]Alright, I didn't do the easiest one.
[51:55.87]That's all I care about.
[52:05.49]Good.
[52:10.16]Ooh, look at this one.
[52:12.62]Don't forget the hardware save state.
[52:18.08]Oh, this is awesome.
[52:19.03]I love this one.
[52:23.17]It's not even hard.
[52:23.89]It's fun.
[52:30.76]Come on, dude.
[52:39.84]Multiple Dave States.
[52:41.40]Senator Dave State.
[52:44.74]Senator Dave State.
[52:47.12]He's a statesman.
[52:54.05]Holy shit, okay.
[53:02.87]Game sucks.
[53:03.85]Game sucks.
[53:04.71]Game sucks.
[53:19.65]He hates the game.
[53:20.63]No, actually, I really like it.
[53:25.75]Hardware save.
[53:27.39]Imagine how much of a pain in the ass that would be.
[53:29.26]You'd have to plug in different audio-video cables and a different HDMI source.
[53:37.27]Here we go.
[53:48.07]We're almost halfway through advanced.
[53:49.63]Can these move?
[54:04.68]How do you not get that banana?
[54:10.90]Dave States, Dave Gate.
[54:14.24]Dave Gate.
[54:18.13]I understand how this works, but my brain is having trouble still.
[54:20.55]Doesn't matter.
[54:24.39]It's going with the moving of the game board.
[54:27.19]I just... I don't care.
[54:28.93]Go in.
[54:29.17]That time bonus is, uh... Trending.
[54:43.70]Oh, trending.
[54:44.46]I don't... Do you think I have that much influence that I could get something trending on Twitter?
[54:49.54]No.
[54:51.08]It would take like 50 times the amount of people that are here.
[54:57.71]Why can I not do this?
[55:01.81]Why the hell would I want that?
[55:02.75]Of all the things that could... Why would I want that to be the thing that trends?
[55:08.97]Hold on.
[55:09.59]Hold on a second.
[55:10.05]Let me just...
[55:17.02]I'll get my other, uh, I have GameCube number four here lined up.
[55:21.66]Get it plugged in.
[55:23.46]And turned on.
[55:25.27]Alright.
[55:27.57]DaveCube.
[55:30.69]Yeah, uh, the senator from Miami, please step forward.
[55:35.48]Yeah, it's me, Dave.
[55:38.22]I'd like to introduce Bill number S2101 to rename the GameCube the DaveCube.
[55:45.06]I find this to be incredibly important to our country's security and to my ego.
[55:51.98]I'm looking at you over there right now.
[55:58.19]I just realized something.
[55:58.89]We're like up in space.
[55:59.97]We're looking down.
[56:00.79]That's kind of insane.
[56:05.30]Can a senator from Miami please step forward?
[56:07.76]Yeah.
[56:11.46]I think it's preponderant that I put forth Bill 41102 to rename Dark Souls to Dame Souls.
[56:24.73]It might as well be this stupid shit.
[56:26.67]I'll be honest with you.
[56:32.23]If that was on C-Span today, I probably really wouldn't be surprised.
[56:50.60]I'm so not good at this.
[56:53.48]These curves are tricky as hell.
[56:55.86]I've said that two or three times today already.
[56:57.43]Oh, this is like fun as hell.
[56:59.37]Why am I doing that?
[57:02.30]Is the level moving on its own?
[57:03.80]This is fucking hard.
[57:10.67]Why did I think that was gonna work?
[57:27.76]Those of you that have joining us you have to understand it Do you think that I was going to be able to play through?
[57:35.38]This game and get to this point like 50 times Do you think that was gonna happen I
[57:46.21]We're already here 50 times.
[57:58.18]Please stop pretending you- I'm banning you for life.
[58:04.82]You complete The Simpsons without save states.
[58:07.68]Because I didn't know they existed.
[58:13.79]I mean, I knew they existed.
[58:15.09]I knew they existed.
[58:18.57]But I wasn't using them.
[58:20.11]Oh my fucking god.
[58:26.71]I did know.
[58:27.33]I knew what they were.
[58:28.07]Hold on.
[58:28.43]Let me just take a quick sip of something.
[58:35.69]Okay.
[58:39.75]God damn it.
[59:08.21]It was out of the GameCube.
[59:10.00]Just plug it out of the GameCube really quick.
[59:14.14]Oh, wow!
[59:14.88]Cool!
[59:16.18]GameCube number five!
[59:17.22]How many Gamecubes is it gonna take?
[59:31.71]Your room would be so hot right now.
[59:34.23]You got like 30 GameCubes all plugged in, all running, all spinning, and all making disk noises.
[59:39.33]Can you imagine hearing that typical, like, I am, people that think I'm going to stoop to save stating in the middle of a level.
[59:56.78]That's not gonna happen here.
[59:58.54]I have to do, I have to beat it at least on my own.
[60:04.36]What the fuck, man?
[60:05.24]That's so fucking weird.
[60:06.56]It just rips you to the side.
[60:14.50]Fuck the bananas.
[60:20.61]I'm not getting any.
[60:25.55]What the fuck?
[60:26.35]I'm pulling as hard as I can to the right.
[60:33.44]What the fuck is this?
[60:35.18]What the hell, man?
[60:36.37]That's actually infuriating.
[60:38.41]I'm holding as far to the left and right as I can.
[61:04.54]Somebody just put my finger in my belly button and moved it around.
[61:08.71]It was like... That's what it feels like when I put my finger in my belly button.
[61:13.83]I push and move it around.
[61:26.16]I can't.
[61:28.32]It takes too much...
[61:34.26]End the stream?
[61:35.10]No, what?
[61:35.78]Resign, resign.
[61:58.26]I can't end it.
[61:59.32]No, I'm not gonna end it.
[62:00.88]I'm not gonna end the stream.
[62:02.20]Fuck, I'm like, I'm losing my mind right now.
[62:05.55]And not because of the game, because of the shit that I'm reading.
[62:08.25]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[62:31.06]You don't understand, I'm holding left as hard as I can to the other side when I get up there.
[62:44.04]I fucking hate this.
[62:45.67]I can't even fucking do it.
[62:46.53]Alright, I'm gonna put a...
[62:59.10]No, I can't use that.
[63:00.64]That's an emergency brake.
[63:02.90]I'm not pulling the emergency brake right now.
[63:07.92]Got it!
[63:08.60]Oh, fuck.
[63:11.25]No!
[63:12.33]I can't pull the ratatouille emergency brake.
[63:15.39]I can't pull it yet.
[63:25.25]Stop screaming.
[63:25.91]What are you, crazy?
[63:39.17]It just rips you down.
[63:43.87]No, my god.
[63:45.03]I'm not pretending.
[63:46.11]I'm not.
[63:46.60]I swear to god.
[63:48.56]Oh, okay.
[63:49.22]Stop.
[63:49.78]I'm gonna relax.
[64:06.20]I'm not- imagine having to like be really self-conscious about the fact that you promised to people you're not pretending to lose at a GameCube game.
[64:14.34]Fuck you!
[64:32.39]Fuck you!
[64:34.81]Stop!
[64:38.74]Stop!
[64:39.12]I didn't even do anything!
[64:40.36]Pull back!
[64:42.76]I didn't even do anything.
[64:44.56]I didn't even do anything.
[64:46.64]I didn't even do anything!
[64:47.70]It was going so slow!
[65:01.05]Yes, your problem.
[65:01.91]No!
[65:02.39]If I go fast, it just throws me right off!
[65:08.59]no no no okay dude I'm holding it as tight as I can to the bottom I'm holding it as tight as I can and I'm just slowly falling down ready
[65:53.77]No, fuck!
[66:10.51]What is hard like?
[66:11.49]What I wanna know.
[66:12.17]This is advanced?
[66:12.93]What's the other- what's the hard ones like?
[66:24.58]Take this audio and put it over me watching like big moments in TV shows.
[66:30.32]Like daytime TV shows, like soap operas.
[66:36.46]Like when there's the reveal that... Wait!
[66:38.40]No!
[66:39.22]I'm in the hospital and... You're not the father!
[66:42.57]No!
[66:42.89]Fuck no!
[66:49.85]I'm just having like extreme reactions to daytime TV.
[66:53.49]Like, settle down.
[67:09.75]Okay, this is where I fuck it up every time.
[67:16.07]Stop and fucking run!
[67:18.47]Run up it!
[67:21.54]Oh, thank you!
[67:23.52]What?
[67:25.56]God damn it.
[67:33.85]Lore 16.
[67:38.52]I'm not doing that one again.
[67:39.40]Let's first try this one.
[67:41.44]What do you say?
[67:45.17]Almost.
[67:45.53]I had it.
[67:50.25]Imagine getting angry about silly monkeys in a ball.
[67:57.60]Alright.
[67:58.94]Should I?
[67:59.28]I need to do it.
[68:00.32]I have to.
[68:01.74]I don't care.
[68:02.70]I don't care.
[68:04.60]Check this link.
[68:07.70]I need 100 bananas.
[68:08.12]Let me pause it.
[68:10.16]What do you want me to do?
[68:22.63]What are you guys doing?
[68:24.09]What are you doing?
[68:24.73]What have you done?
[68:25.21]No, it's not real.
[68:30.43]It's not real.
[68:31.81]It's not real.
[68:32.25]That's like, I don't want it.
[68:35.14]It's not real.
[68:37.55]But it's... That's so stupid.
[68:45.44]Miami Republican Senator Dave State introduces bill which would rename Nintendo's GameCube to the Dave Cube.
[69:02.76]That's so stupid.
[69:04.06]I don't even, like, I can't even address it.
[69:07.14]No, I'm not pulling the rat tattoo emergency brake.
[69:13.01]Fuck, this is hard as shit.
[69:18.01]This is really fucking hard.
[69:20.23]Four and a half hours, my ass.
[69:23.01]No way this took four and a half hours for someone to beat the whole game.
[69:25.67]The whole game?! !
[69:39.83]You're just bad.
[69:40.57]Omega lull.
[69:43.07]Wait, that wasn't even an omega lull.
[69:44.21]That was a regular lull.
[69:45.21]I increased your lull for you.
[69:57.82]Alright, that's not that bad.
[70:01.81]I can't imagine people that can just scream through all these levels.
[70:04.35]Like, holy shit, how?
[70:20.12]Watch the speedrun.
[70:20.84]It's insane.
[70:21.58]I can imagine.
[70:22.24]This is insane.
[70:24.52]You suck, dude.
[70:25.34]Omega Lola.
[70:26.08]Stop.
[70:28.64]Somebody said Conan O'Brien?
[70:34.79]I don't understand this monkey ball thing.
[70:36.29]I guess it's really hard.
[70:40.83]Gaming with Conan.
[70:46.86]level of skill level that's that's so that makes me so I can't well how do I that makes me feel a certain way it does get this next part coming up you shitting me there's no way there's no way I do this yeah
[71:16.92]Don't tell me to fucking hurry up.
[71:18.02]I hate that.
[71:20.24]It's too stressful.
[71:42.82]These are easy, just get here quickly.
[71:44.54]I can go slow on the next part, that part that I fell off on.
[71:46.83]Let's hurry the hell up.
[71:51.11]Who cares about the 10 straight seconds it's gonna take you to cone in that banana?
[71:54.51]God damn it.
[72:02.91]Strippers in the window.
[72:04.45]What window?
[72:04.93]Alright, I thought you were talking about my window.
[72:09.39]I was like, that would be really weird.
[72:26.20]He looked.
[72:29.00]I mean, I was trying to figure out what you're talking about.
[72:31.01]I did look.
[72:32.71]Okay, good time.
[72:39.49]Now I'll slow it down.
[72:40.27]What are you doing?
[72:42.12]Okay, I got 30 seconds to get through this.
[72:46.36]Just go slow.
[73:00.61]Fucking no.
[73:02.34]No, it's that last little turn!
[73:31.86]No, Conan would have the celebrity play this part.
[73:37.89]If that was me, then we would really be fucked.
[73:42.85]So, Jerma, how you doing?
[73:43.99]You having trouble with this level?
[73:45.37]Yeah, I'm bad at the game.
[73:46.67]Me too.
[73:47.13]I'm going to have to edit this whole segment out.
[73:52.38]Conan, I'm sorry.
[73:53.44]I know I'm supposed to be a streamer or something.
[74:00.32]You're gonna have to recut this whole thing and redo this whole thing.
[74:02.28]Put, like, a dog here or something.
[74:03.50]And, like, use the gameplay footage and make, like, a dog playing the game joke with you.
[74:07.11]I'm really sorry.
[74:08.89]You can use that idea, though.
[74:10.51]If I get, like, 10% royalty from whatever the advertising comes in that show for that day.
[74:14.28]I'll give you the idea and, like, I, you know, set it up for you.
[74:29.51]Give me at least one of those bananas, I'll be happy.
[74:37.22]I'm starting to think you don't have a bunch of GameCubes with save states.
[74:42.58]Fuck no, don't make me laugh.
[74:44.68]I can't not pay attention.
[74:50.67]They would be stacked up in the garage at this point.
[74:57.78]It would be in the bathtub.
[74:59.86]Stacked.
[75:01.29]In the toilets.
[75:02.85]In the fridge.
[75:03.67]There'd be nowhere to put them.
[75:06.21]Dude, you know what I think else?
[75:15.68]Here's the other problem.
[75:16.50]I think it's the music that's doing it to me too.
[75:21.36]Oh my god, my fucking computer!
[75:50.65]Yeah!
[75:54.37]Put on a different soundtrack.
[75:56.79]Put a different soundtrack on.
[75:57.89]Should I put another soundtrack on?
[76:05.05]Wait, is there a race?
[76:05.99]I'm racing somebody.
[76:16.30]Yeah, this is ba- like yeah, I'm not sure how much longer I can take, like the SEGA Bass Pro Fishing soundtrack.
[76:22.97]Why was that one hard?
[76:30.39]Oh, this one looks elaborate.
[76:33.55]These shortcuts, damn it.
[76:45.55]Get outta here!
[76:45.99]Alright, I need this, so I don't have to save, uh, you know, the thing that the senator was doing.
[77:13.41]Stop doing that.
[77:14.05]Oh, it's irritating.
[77:15.21]I even get irritated in the actual pinball machines if this happens.
[77:17.41]I'm just like, stop doing that.
[77:19.25]Shut up.
[77:29.30]Okay, I got 11.
[77:33.53]This, what is this, a water level?
[77:36.79]Uh...
[77:42.85]First try, let's go.
[77:45.01]This one's not even that bad.
[77:45.85]A dull submarine.
[77:52.61]What are you- Dull.
[78:03.14]I just want to get the bananas.
[78:16.86]Insane Aquarium?
[78:17.82]Oh, that's one of the greatest video games of all time.
[78:19.50]I'm glad you agree.
[78:20.16]Alright, so I have to stay really close and then bang a right, right?
[78:25.57]That's kind of how this works.
[78:34.75]Jesus.
[78:35.11]Alright, I'm good.
[78:37.99]This wasn't that bad.
[78:42.83]How do you speedrun this one?
[78:43.81]I feel like that would be very hard to do.
[78:52.80]Bring back grandpa.
[78:55.58]I don't know, man.
[79:03.64]What?
[79:04.80]You don't have to go in that hole?
[79:05.96]Where's the goal?
[79:11.76]Oh, it's over there.
[79:12.48]Oh, shit.
[79:12.82]Okay.
[79:13.34]Right.
[79:19.13]Bring him back from hell.
[79:22.38]I don't really want to.
[79:25.36]Oh, shit.
[79:25.88]That's gonna be fucking hard.
[79:27.28]I already know it.
[79:35.47]Bring back Bugleberry.
[79:37.69]You will see him again.
[79:38.45]Don't worry.
[79:40.05]Just at least get the... Get the big one up here.
[79:45.09]At least.
[79:45.43]Okay, go.
[79:46.03]I don't care.
[79:46.59]What the fuck do I care?
[79:54.56]Oh boy, this one.
[79:59.57]Halloween Bugleberry stream?
[80:03.47]Maybe.
[80:06.70]I don't think anyone that's ever played this game has ever fallen through that one.
[80:10.38]I don't think so.
[80:11.52]I think I may be the first one.
[80:21.24]Alright, we're gonna hug the left side.
[80:22.74]Uh, where's the map?
[80:27.06]Do I get the bananas?
[80:27.76]I'm running out of time.
[80:31.86]How do I get those?
[80:34.00]Not yet.
[80:34.50]Oh, hold on.
[80:34.86]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[80:38.90]Do the mandatory ego boost stream when Bugleberry's on.
[80:42.50]That's a fucking brilliant idea.
[80:51.03]Fuck the bananas.
[80:51.77]I know.
[80:56.89]I want him.
[80:58.19]I want it.
[81:03.52]Oh my god, this one's... I don't like this.
[81:04.64]I hate this one.
[81:05.42]You gonna play Saw again?
[81:08.28]Yeah, I'm gonna play... I'm gonna finish Saw 1 and then go to Saw 2.
[81:11.62]Probably on the same day.
[81:20.00]Get a bunch of speed running this thing.
[81:21.40]Just do it.
[81:23.86]And now... What?
[81:26.66]Go down?
[81:30.23]Okay, and then... Is this on a slant?
[81:39.11]No, this is good.
[81:41.69]Good.
[81:43.19]Oh, I could have got those bananas over there.
[81:44.49]Shit.
[81:49.57]Oh my god, click the funny link, Jerma.
[81:51.81]Haha.
[81:54.47]Uh, I'm not clicking any links.
[82:04.03]You play Hylics.
[82:05.07]I actually have that now.
[82:10.33]I bought that a while ago.
[82:15.23]So at least this one's insane.
[82:20.43]Oh, no, he missed a banana.
[82:21.43]Yeah.
[82:22.79]I'm fine.
[82:24.11]I'll be good.
[82:29.29]Pylex OST fucks.
[82:33.01]Okay.
[82:36.42]Dude, how would you do this without a save state?
[82:48.54]Oh my god, don't- just forget about the bananas and just do it.
[82:52.78]Do it.
[82:53.34]Just go.
[82:53.82]Oh, by the way, let me just be- let me just make a comment on this.
[82:59.52]This is not a Mario Slide game.
[83:03.35]The reason why I decided to play this is because I was like, man, I wish there was a game where it's only Mario Slides.
[83:08.03]This is not it.
[83:30.64]No way.
[83:34.45]Super Mario, wait.
[83:37.31]I might just be making this up, and somebody probably just didn't even say this, but... Did somebody just say that there is a Mario 64 ROM hack with all slides?
[83:47.27]Did I make that up?
[83:48.41]Did I, like, take somebody's words and just twist them completely?
[83:55.44]There is.
[83:56.38]No shit.
[83:57.12]Is there really?
[84:01.86]Oh, that's awesome.
[84:02.90]I might have to look into that.
[84:12.21]There are so many.
[84:16.71]I'll have to give them a try.
[84:17.67]That sounds fun.
[84:19.64]I love Mario slides.
[84:34.44]okay not too hard not too soft just right not too hard not too soft just right like that oh shit this one's crazy oh man this one's crazy good commentary on the game oh man this one's gonna be nuts
[85:06.65]Oh boy, I already, that's already, I can already tell this is gonna be a, uh... This one's gonna be hell.
[85:11.39]Do I just try to do the whole thing in one go?
[85:14.63]Nah, I'm not that good.
[85:18.83]I'm not that smart.
[85:19.57]Whatever.
[85:23.18]Just go really fast.
[85:33.24]How's my voice not get tired?
[85:36.44]Well, it's from years of being classically trained to be speaking and singing in a way.
[85:41.09]Like, for instance, I'm contracting my vocal cords in a way that make it so it's not so much strain.
[85:50.18]Like, it's... I've been trained pretty well.
[86:02.66]You're taught during vocal school to only use about 10% of your power level in your voice.
[86:07.18]I wasn't paying attention.
[86:21.99]I was doing pretty good.
[86:23.49]Oh, fuck you.
[86:30.30]What would 20% of your power level look like?
[86:35.63]And they make a whole TV show about that.
[86:37.03]Oh, she's using more than 10% of her brain, and she can fold cars in half with her mind.
[86:45.11]That's the best movie where the lady can look at people and fold them up into a pretzel.
[87:03.41]I'm not going to get this right, ever.
[87:34.57]It was called Lucy with Scarlett Johansson.
[87:39.33]Yeah.
[87:45.33]Put on the Conan OST.
[87:52.56]There's no Conan OST.
[87:53.92]They just play... Wait, does that mean I'm going max speed?
[88:05.30]There's no Conan OST.
[88:07.14]Why would there be a Conan OST?
[88:13.69]The Conan OST is just background, like, jazz music.
[88:21.77]I'm looking at chat, and I'm not looking at the game.
[88:27.16]Conan OST.
[88:29.78]Oh, okay.
[88:30.18]Well, there's a Conan the Barbarian OST.
[88:46.07]Hold on, let me just- Play it, play it, play it.
[88:53.82]Why are you linking the QRS clip?
[88:57.42]What a fucked up stream.
[89:09.45]I was- I was drunk.
[89:14.73]Like really drunk on that stream.
[89:19.79]Okay.
[89:20.05]Slow down.
[89:20.55]Don't go this fast.
[89:21.83]Here it comes.
[89:27.15]Okay.
[89:27.31]I got it.
[89:27.65]I got it.
[89:27.91]I got it.
[89:28.09]I'm good.
[89:28.29]I'm good.
[89:30.49]Oh, really?
[89:31.15]Yeah.
[89:44.40]What?
[89:46.74]Oh, I have to go that way.
[89:52.58]Did I Dave State this?
[89:57.90]Fuck.
[89:58.32]Not good.
[89:58.69]Just fall off.
[89:59.35]Who cares?
[89:59.67]What the hell?
[90:04.49]How am I...
[90:16.94]Somebody said, what is it?
[90:18.32]Dave State?
[90:20.60]Oh, right.
[90:21.08]He might not have been here.
[90:21.82]I don't know.
[90:27.54]I need to go fast.
[90:28.48]Yeah, but I went fast last time.
[90:30.00]I overshot it, didn't I?
[90:30.88]Oh, fuck.
[90:33.57]Okay, I got it.
[90:37.03]Dave Cube.
[90:44.41]I got it.
[90:50.29]Yeah, that's the kind of speed you're looking for.
[90:52.17]Yeah, it is.
[90:55.61]Well, that's not gonna work out, is it?
[91:00.01]Hey, you!
[91:18.62]Talking to you?
[91:24.40]What a fun level.
[91:25.28]It is.
[91:28.23]It's fun.
[91:28.75]It's fun.
[91:35.55]Fucking God.
[91:36.29]Oh, fucking God.
[91:37.95]Listen to me.
[91:39.09]I said, like, fucking... Oh, my God.
[91:41.15]Is this a Dollar Tree streamer?
[91:56.00]I'm trying to piece together what that means.
[91:58.14]I think what you mean by that is... That this is so... The gameplay is not high quality or something.
[92:05.59]It's still good enough.
[92:08.15]You can still use it.
[92:08.83]I don't know.
[92:10.01]What does that mean?
[92:12.59]Some high quality shit at the dollar store.
[92:13.79]I don't know what you're talking about.
[92:29.88]You look like you came from the dollar store.
[92:31.88]With like a bag of groceries or something?
[92:35.43]Like, what is that?
[92:36.39]Who cares?
[92:36.87]Like, oh, I have some stuff from the dollar store.
[92:41.28]Wow, it looks like you really came out of the dollar store.
[92:43.24]Yeah, I came out of the dollar store and I have some stuff in a bag.
[92:46.40]I've got like a baseball cap on and a t-shirt.
[92:48.28]What, is there something wrong?
[93:03.62]This is just Fall Guys flashback to that stupid level that I don't like.
[93:06.76]Oh, no.
[93:08.38]Okay.
[93:09.44]Is this the final level?
[93:13.31]Can I go over there in one go?
[93:14.19]I'm gonna go for it.
[93:18.81]I can.
[93:19.31]I can.
[93:19.51]I can.
[93:19.80]I can.
[93:20.10]I can.
[93:20.30]I can.
[93:20.50]I can.
[93:33.82]Stop going so fucking fast.
[93:55.47]Dollar store strat.
[93:57.39]That's not even funny.
[93:58.90]Where's the humor there?
[94:02.95]What's the joke?
[94:03.47]I don't even get it.
[94:03.93]What's the joke?
[94:04.33]I don't understand.
[94:04.97]Explain the joke to me.
[94:16.32]Why did I go that way?
[94:17.18]It means you're... I know what it means.
[94:26.82]Oh, shit.
[94:27.18]It's Frogger.
[94:27.74]I just need to get the rope.
[94:28.68]Okay.
[94:43.59]Oh, please.
[94:44.27]Why did I get on that?
[95:05.26]Dude, what?
[95:06.82]Imagine being like a kid with a GameCube controller in your hand right now.
[95:09.98]And you have your memory card plugged in and you get to here.
[95:13.51]This is level like 30.
[95:14.71]And you have to do this bullshit like this many times before you get it right.
[95:19.43]You have to play through the game 45 times.
[95:25.00]Four and a half my ass.
[95:37.52]Four and a half.
[95:38.08]Did I say 45?
[95:38.72]Yeah, four and a half, my ass.
[95:40.47]Not 45, my ass.
[95:41.71]Do I have to wait for it to hold the cycle?
[95:48.09]I think so.
[95:48.55]Wait.
[95:49.01]I can get in this one.
[95:55.35]There it is.
[95:57.97]Nice.
[96:01.44]That's it.
[96:01.80]I did it.
[96:13.94]We're free!
[96:20.70]Wait, am I falling right now out of the sky?
[96:28.90]Now do expert.
[96:29.62]I'm gonna... I'm gonna try it.
[96:35.93]Let's turn the music off though.
[96:42.41]Oh, the sub thing.
[96:43.27]Right, the sub bananas.
[96:44.13]Presented by SEGA.
[96:57.01]He's going to die so much.
[97:11.52]Okay, I don't care.
[97:12.68]The name doesn't even matter.
[97:13.48]That was advanced mode.
[97:24.03]We're now going to move on to expert mode.
[97:39.59]I'll try GonGon.
[97:43.76]expert 50 stages this is gonna be horrible this is some weird link we want to click on alright fake trump tweet
[98:07.54]I've just heard about Dave Gate.
[98:09.52]The American people shouldn't tolerate this name change from GameCube to DaveCube.
[98:15.29]As a gamer myself, I will not let this happen.
[98:18.99]Senator Dave needs to resign immediately.
[98:21.75]Right now.
[98:35.73]Here we go.
[98:38.39]Bigly.
[98:40.32]Bigly, shoo.
[98:43.68]Expert time!
[98:54.25]Nothing.
[98:54.57]Alright, let's get up.
[98:55.19]Let's get... Yo!
[98:57.19]That's not... Why are there two goals?
[99:04.96]What's a red gull do?
[99:07.26]Holy shit.
[99:14.22]That's a lot of bananas.
[99:21.06]I've got to get them all.
[99:25.64]I just jumped to floor five?
[99:27.02]I just skipped a floor.
[99:31.32]Holy shit.
[99:31.80]Okay, I've jumped to... I skipped it.
[99:45.51]I can see how a 13 or 14 year old me would have played this game a million times.
[99:50.87]Even if I lost every time.
[99:52.03]I would just be after school with a peanut butter and fluff sandwich.
[99:55.36]And I would get sticky fluff hands all over the controller and I would not clean it.
[100:02.82]It would never be cleaned.
[100:03.54]It would just cake on there.
[100:13.80]You know what fluff is?
[100:16.55]Alright, fluff is a New England thing, isn't it?
[100:20.71]It's like marshmallow cream.
[100:24.17]Kraft has a wicked shitty version called, like, Jet Puff.
[100:26.71]I don't know, this stuff sucks.
[100:28.71]Not the same.
[100:48.22]That was stupid.
[100:49.60]That was stupid, Jeremy.
[100:51.14]Why are you doing stupid things?
[100:52.54]Uh.
[101:09.37]Uh.
[101:30.70]Don't you fucking crash on me.
[101:40.79]This one sucks.
[101:42.81]I haven't even played it yet.
[101:43.65]Can I skip?
[101:48.55]We have fluff in the south.
[101:49.35]We call it peanut butter and fluffer nutter.
[101:51.41]Yeah.
[101:53.09]Me too.
[101:56.22]A lot of places don't have it, though.
[102:00.52]That's hard.
[102:08.47]Why continue?
[102:09.11]We have infinite continues.
[102:16.39]You're never going to beat this, by the way.
[102:18.74]Hold on.
[102:19.14]You say, I'm never going to beat this.
[102:28.84]Never.
[102:29.16]The answer, the word, the answer is never.
[102:34.67]Shit, that was so fast.
[102:39.29]Never?
[102:40.35]Ever, not ever?
[102:58.27]Oh, man.
[103:08.26]You're too old.
[103:11.59]Well, hey, how about this?
[103:13.57]I'll tell you when I'm going to give up.
[103:15.65]Not the other way around.
[103:27.50]Well, that's the beauty of being a VOD watcher.
[103:29.14]You can watch every portion of the stream you want.
[103:32.03]You can rewind this 10 times and watch me do this right now.
[103:43.09]Oh my fucking god.
[103:44.44]Okay, I was misled.
[103:55.10]Durama Monkey Ball is like a Mario Slide game.
[103:57.38]No, no, no.
[103:57.82]It's a balancing beam game.
[103:59.88]Very different and very much not in my wheelhouse.
[104:15.18]My EZs.
[104:20.00]Okay.
[104:22.36]Oh, yuck.
[104:23.76]Yuck.
[104:24.50]Balancing beam bullshit.
[104:26.06]It's not a Mario slide game.
[104:28.03]It's a balancing beam game.
[104:30.63]Oh, I'm sorry.
[104:43.73]That hurt.
[104:44.13]You're playing the wrong one.
[104:50.80]How could they be a right monkey?
[104:52.28]Aren't they all fun and all like this?
[104:56.15]Although, wait, there probably is one Super Monkey Ball party game.
[105:00.81]Where it's just like Mario Party, but it's Monkey Ball.
[105:06.31]Okay.
[105:06.61]Go fast, maybe?
[105:08.29]Just run... Am I gonna fall through that?
[105:10.94]I'm gonna try to go very fast.
[105:14.72]Holy shit, it worked.
[105:26.60]my god this is so hard no way dude dude no way not a chance in hell that's so hard it's so stressful this has been somebody said there's like one slide
[105:58.08]Why did it work the first time?
[105:59.48]He's never, ever, ever gonna win.
[106:12.66]Okay, settle down.
[106:18.78]I'm fine.
[106:30.09]Okay, I'm at that point in this room where I can feel like the criticism.
[106:34.49]I can hear it.
[106:35.17]I can feel it.
[106:36.45]It's like in my nose.
[106:38.15]It's itching.
[106:39.93]I can hear what you're saying.
[106:48.63]Why did it work the first time?
[106:50.51]Why did it work the first time?
[106:57.38]It worked- Why does it work the first time?
[107:07.44]Thank god I have infinite lives.
[107:08.46]Right now, my pants are sagging down to my ankles.
[107:16.09]At the arcade.
[107:16.93]Because they're just so- There's like 12 pounds of coins in both pockets.
[107:29.21]I have infinite coins.
[108:05.19]You're going to the arcade with a diaper on full of coins Okay, is the diaper on over your jeans?
[108:16.68]Because that would be okay, wouldn't it?
[108:25.41]If you had a pair of jeans, like you had underwear, pants, like a pair of jeans on, and then you had a diaper on over it, and that's what you filled with tokens.
[108:36.54]Is that okay?
[108:37.72]Like, what's wrong with that?
[108:41.68]Stop you motherfucker, I swear to God.
[108:43.58]What do you mean worse?
[108:55.63]Hold on, you said you would get arrested for doing the Doug funny?
[108:59.21]That's... You'd get arrested.
[109:01.56]Okay, so if I like brought a diaper into a store and held it in my hand, and I was like fully clothed, I would get arrested.
[109:13.69]Why are diapers illegal to own?
[109:16.21]Okay.
[109:28.62]I'm starting to believe that they're, um... I'm starting to believe the people when they say that I'm never gonna beat it.
[109:39.13]I almost... Okay.
[109:49.17]Should I slow it down here?
[109:50.19]Okay, I've failed this over and over and over again by trying to run past it as fast as I can.
[109:56.68]So I'm just gonna do it the way that I think I should be doing it.
[109:59.90]Oh my god.
[110:25.32]That's probably true.
[110:27.56]Probably right.
[110:35.67]7 out of 50.
[110:36.45]Yeah, but look, this is one of the hard ones.
[110:39.83]This is the gear check.
[110:41.74]If I can get past this one, then I'll just skip to like level 12 eventually with one of those skippers.
[110:54.49]I don't fucking get it.
[110:55.13]I don't get it.
[110:55.57]I don't get it.
[110:56.03]I'm going to safe state there.
[110:56.85]I don't even care.
[110:58.61]I'm going to safe state.
[110:59.19]I'm safe stating right there.
[111:07.11]No, no, no, no, no.
[111:08.61]Yes.
[111:10.31]Yes.
[111:18.47]Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[111:20.75]I got it this time.
[111:41.78]Somebody just said, oh, yo, dude, I came to the stream.
[111:44.36]You're playing this on Davecube, right?
[111:46.25]Yeah, that bill passed.
[111:50.41]It turns out nobody actually gives a shit if that's changed or not.
[111:57.85]This console hasn't been relevant in 20 years.
[112:00.57]No one cares.
[112:17.11]No, please!
[112:22.45]No, please!
[112:32.84]Why?
[112:33.44]I'm one of those people in like the shooting games that pop up that they go, don't shoot me!
[113:08.60]I'm gonna get real angry here in a minute.
[113:12.45]I'm gonna save state there.
[113:14.49]Use the baby?
[113:15.29]Why?
[113:15.55]The baby's smaller?
[113:20.87]Wait, is that real?
[113:21.58]Am I making this harder for no reason?
[113:26.76]Am I?
[113:26.98]I can't change characters in the middle of this.
[113:43.01]Oh fucking my god.
[113:44.73]What am I gonna do here?
[113:45.71]I have to- I have to get out of this.
[113:47.65]I have to get out of this level.
[113:56.79]What the fuck are you doing?
[113:58.15]You can't do this to me.
[114:03.19]You can't just fuck up and-
[114:24.59]God damn it, Dave.
[114:27.87]God damn it, Dave.
[114:29.39]Why?
[114:29.65]It's the fucking music.
[114:46.14]I gotta turn the music off.
[114:52.99]It's the music.
[114:53.47]The music's going off.
[115:11.27]No, that's not good.
[115:52.50]No, I want to just do... No, I wanted to... Feel good.
[116:26.00]I don't care.
[116:27.36]I really don't even care.
[116:28.90]You can scream in my face if you want.
[116:31.26]You can grab me and pull me and scream in my face.
[116:33.77]I'm not even going to need it.
[117:10.81]My hands are so greasy.
[117:13.65]My hands, it's unbelievable.
[117:25.99]Oh my fucking god, what am I doing?
[117:27.13]Stop, stop.
[117:27.69]Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[118:09.02]Oh shit!
[118:24.08]Ran out of disk space for the save states.
[118:43.12]DON'T DO THAT!
[118:45.22]I almost just- okay.
[118:46.46]Don't be a fucking idiot, man.
[118:47.94]I almost just save-stated while I was going down.
[118:50.32]I can't!
[119:00.91]I have to use one hand!
[119:02.21]I have to use one hand!
[119:07.67]Ow, my chest!
[119:19.68]Oh, the time!
[119:20.60]There's no time!
[119:23.53]What?!
[119:23.85]I can't- I have to get it!
[119:55.77]fuck I I was that was fine
[120:51.45]How can you imagine?
[120:54.86]Think about all the times to start over and get to the amount of times that I have pressed F1.
[121:01.00]Just on that beam.
[121:02.68]And do it all every level over again.
[121:04.54]And that's how many times it takes.
[121:10.66]Thanks for watching!
[121:37.35]Thanks for watching!
[122:13.21]Okay, so we're fine.
[122:19.01]No, that's not the right one.
[122:20.01]That's the safe state.
[122:21.11]It's not doing anything.
[122:32.61]Oh, sad is deranged Jeremy now.
[122:34.75]Wait, what?
[122:38.16]I feel like this one's my wall.
[122:40.70]I really do.
[122:42.03]Oh my fucking god.
[122:47.03]I am going to blow through the rest of this whole thing.
[122:51.95]Once I get past this level, I'm going to destroy the rest of the game.
[122:55.32]This is the wall.
[122:56.00]This is the dumb wall that I have.
[123:12.53]Oh my god, my whole world is blending together.
[123:16.65]The whole world is together.
[123:17.57]I can see everything.
[123:19.11]Fuck.
[123:26.58]How the fuck do people play this game?
[123:28.44]It's so ridiculous.
[123:32.16]The amount of coins.
[123:33.32]I'm gonna need five people to come into the arcade with me all filled with diapers.
[123:37.24]All having diapers on.
[123:44.01]Take a break.
[123:48.55]In a minute.
[123:50.03]I'll go pee in a minute and get some water.
[124:05.31]Okay.
[124:06.20]Let's not screw this up.
[124:10.57]easy get it right don't even if I fall it's okay I can do it again you idiot
[124:52.83]I don't think there was enough- there wasn't enough time anyways.
[124:54.99]There wasn't enough time anyways, even if I got to the end.
[125:06.16]Oh my fucking god, you've gotta be kidding me.
[125:09.04]I have to go much faster than that.
[125:10.26]I gotta go so much faster.
[125:13.02]Oh my god, this is bad.
[125:14.02]Okay, hold on.
[125:29.17]Fuck you!
[125:53.94]Are we really gonna hold on to guys fellas and we're really gonna pull off the is he pretending line How badly I don't want to be on this level anymore I
[126:27.14]I'm overthinking it.
[126:28.32]Oh my god, I'm stuck here forever.
[126:31.42]I'm stuck here forever, I think.
[126:32.50]I don't think I'll ever get by this, ever.
[126:38.57]Put on the facecam?
[126:40.57]No.
[126:41.79]No, I look horrible today.
[126:48.76]Alright, slow down.
[126:56.10]Not bad.
[126:56.42]Not bad time.
[126:56.94]Not bad time.
[126:58.01]Not a bad time.
[126:58.45]Let's go.
[128:06.99]You can't.
[128:21.10]Risky move.
[128:21.64]Risky move incoming.
[128:22.62]Risky move.
[128:23.14]I got it.
[128:23.60]Risky move.
[128:35.12]Okay.
[129:09.08]Okay.
[129:12.50]That was that.
[129:13.52]I made it.
[129:15.74]About 700 people left the stream.
[129:19.64]Welcome back if you decided to take a break and come back.
[129:22.10]I don't blame you at all.
[129:27.74]In fact, I agree with you.
[129:34.03]Okay.
[129:35.97]Nothing can be as annoying as that one just was.
[129:56.97]It will.
[130:30.10]Fuck it.
[130:30.38]Alright, stop doing that.
[130:31.34]I'm gonna keep crashing the fucking console.
[130:47.31]Is Microsoft Edge your default browser?
[130:50.48]What?
[130:50.66]Alright, where are we going?
[130:55.88]Where is it?
[130:57.08]Up?
[131:12.96]How do I get down there?
[131:14.58]Oh, that was hidden!
[131:16.78]This was not even in the- my- Just hold the back- Holy shit, man.
[131:32.89]No human can do this.
[131:34.67]This is a game not- this is a game not for humans.
[131:50.37]But what the fuck does this keep happening for?
[131:53.91]That's the damage you'd be doing to your GameCube right now if you just kept on opening this the lid and Ripping the power button and pulling the power like just what are you trying to break your console?
[132:23.40]That's a bunch of money.
[132:26.33]That's 50 community subs from Freddie Dredd.
[132:27.95]What's up, Freddie?
[132:29.49]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[132:30.73]Holy shit.
[132:38.01]50 more subs from Freddie.
[132:39.57]On top of like the 8,000 he's given the channel over the couple of years.
[132:49.70]I don't care.
[132:50.66]I can at least beat it.
[132:51.34]I don't care if I lose my pride.
[132:56.79]It's still hard.
[132:57.49]It's still really fucking hard.
[132:59.39]Did IGN beat this game?
[133:00.39]I don't think they did.
[133:09.21]What does the game have for a score?
[133:24.93]This is just balance beam the video game
[133:55.75]Holy fucking shit.
[133:58.22]Your mama didn't beat this game?
[133:59.84]No.
[134:01.90]My mother probably couldn't get through 1-1 on Mario.
[134:06.47]She didn't even care.
[134:08.61]I think my mother's played three video games in her entire life.
[134:23.86]Jesus!
[134:26.26]I have to disbalance!
[134:30.69]It's not even supposed to be a broken game.
[134:32.23]I'm running fast through slides!
[134:49.60]Mario slide game, yeah.
[134:55.05]Doctors play this game before surgery.
[135:01.22]It's hard to watch.
[135:02.36]It's hard to play, too.
[135:04.36]Incredibly hard to play.
[135:31.32]This is the first medical exam you have to do?
[135:39.32]Stay on it!
[135:47.87]Jesus Christ!
[135:50.91]Slow down!
[135:51.49]Holy fuck, holy!
[136:18.33]I might just pivot to brushing my teeth on screen.
[136:20.40]Until they're raw.
[136:44.16]You gotta keep him, like, right in the center.
[136:52.02]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[136:56.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[137:00.10]Easy, easy, easy.
[137:28.66]Imagine picking anything besides 0.5.
[137:31.68]I don't know how you do anything besides 0.5.
[137:39.51]The fuck just happened?
[137:40.41]Don't even fucking tell me this everything crashed.
[137:59.83]I need these bananas.
[138:00.55]Alright, so if I make it halfway, do I get to clock out my gamer card?
[138:13.97]No?
[138:14.15]What's the aspect ratio doing?
[138:20.78]The water levels really just fuck up everything on the graphics.
[138:25.22]Didn't get... Oh, well.
[138:30.89]What the hell is this?
[138:43.63]You're right.
[138:47.62]This technically is a slide map.
[138:49.42]You're right.
[138:52.56]I'm going to hold back on the controller.
[138:53.98]I don't want to go too fast, but then I can't see.
[139:05.69]Damn it.
[139:06.27]It's okay.
[139:06.47]I'm still alive.
[139:08.15]Not for long.
[139:08.93]Stay right in the middle.
[139:21.90]What was wrong with that?
[139:22.50]What the fuck happened?
[139:23.10]What?
[139:24.30]That was okay.
[139:25.00]What happened there?
[139:34.12]I went right through it.
[139:44.00]Holy shit, man.
[139:52.89]You can fall off the side, too.
[139:54.47]That sucks.
[139:58.86]Oh my god.
[140:25.81]Fifty floors?
[140:26.81]There's fifty of these.
[140:29.85]Fifty?
[140:33.20]Probably can't just sit there, right?
[140:34.32]It's wasting time.
[140:40.84]Shit.
[140:53.39]You know, the camera really fucks with me, too.
[140:54.77]Because the camera only moves if you move your body, and if you have to turn... Like, I can't press, like, the stick, the right stick to move the camera.
[141:08.37]Wait for another cycle, don't be an idiot.
[141:11.26]30 straight seconds.
[141:21.54]Oh, Jesus.
[141:22.30]Okay.
[141:23.10]Where am I?
[141:37.31]Are you aware that you're not moving the monkey?
[141:44.02]You just blew my mind there, dude.
[141:50.54]I am now.
[142:04.59]easy here okay fine fine easy easy easy easy straight straight on straight on I'll go too you stupid idiot what what what happened what was that wrong we're not going fast enough
[142:38.46]I mean, I don't have a jump.
[142:48.19]I'm starting to tilt.
[142:49.13]I can't tilt right now.
[142:50.91]Relax.
[142:51.33]Don't tilt.
[142:51.95]Just play.
[143:04.72]We're good.
[143:06.33]That saved a bunch of time right there.
[143:23.80]Why?
[143:25.04]You have to go so fast, but you can't go that fast.
[143:29.02]How many times?
[143:48.47]Where's the jump?
[143:49.23]There is no jump.
[143:50.03]How many times do we have to go over this?
[143:53.38]There's no jump button.
[144:00.26]You gotta hold the ground down while you go.
[144:04.14]Man, this sucks.
[144:08.70]Okay, let me see what happens.
[144:10.25]Don't go that fast, but go fast enough.
[144:14.33]I got it.
[144:14.57]I got it.
[144:14.83]I got it.
[144:15.99]Now what?
[144:19.14]Oh, not fucking around here.
[144:21.30]Okay.
[144:37.55]In ball machine things here.
[144:38.41]Excuse me.
[144:52.95]I know some of you guys are saying, dude, what the fuck, save states.
[144:56.00]This stream would have ended an hour and a half ago if I didn't have access to save states.
[145:01.36]Shit, look at all, ugh, this is so tight.
[145:03.28]No, goddammit.
[145:32.64]One of these times you're gonna lose the save state, and that's when we pivot to something else.
[145:58.55]AI dungeon?
[146:00.01]Maybe, we'll see.
[146:03.43]I'm still having fun with this.
[146:09.47]God, dude, what the fuck?
[146:12.16]You gotta stay so far on the left.
[146:14.36]Dude, go pee.
[146:28.88]I'm about to grab this ball and just chuck it a hundred yards.
[146:33.34]Like, where's the master hand that can come down and grab this ball and just fucking shot put it?
[147:02.12]I feel like you guys talking about the speedrunners that have speedrun this game that like, oh yeah, I speedrun this.
[147:06.30]Do they have any teeth left?
[147:08.52]I feel like he has a mouth full of gums.
[147:21.08]Like just from mashing your teeth down, just grinding them down.
[147:30.94]Geez, alright.
[147:34.42]They know how to jump for starters.
[147:38.81]I'm going to press every single button.
[147:40.11]Ready?
[147:44.63]Didn't do anything.
[147:47.25]Wait, what?
[147:47.61]This one's easy.
[147:56.88]Just go straight on.
[148:05.63]Did I win?
[148:05.97]Okay.
[148:14.27]Oh man, this one doesn't look fun either.
[148:25.64]God.
[148:26.04]There's 35 flows left.
[148:29.52]I... I don't think I'm gonna beat this game.
[148:40.90]What about the sticks?
[148:41.82]I did.
[148:44.40]Let me at least just even see what the hell.
[148:45.96]I think you have to go all the way up.
[148:48.58]From corner to corner.
[148:49.52]Let's see what happens.
[148:51.02]Ready?
[148:54.59]I mean, kind of.
[148:55.41]Holy shit.
[149:05.94]I have no idea.
[149:09.94]Dude, Monkey Ball 2 is easier and it has infinite lives.
[149:20.62]Well, I mean, I'm already in expert mode.
[149:22.26]I'm almost halfway there.
[149:25.33]You'll know when I'm done.
[149:31.49]I don't get this one.
[149:36.50]I hop across, like, the gap here?
[149:56.74]Speedrunners do this game in 25 minutes.
[150:00.50]Yeah, that's insane.
[150:10.73]GTA 4 waiting room.
[150:12.01]What are you talking about?
[150:12.85]When did I ever say I was going to play GTA 4?
[150:14.19]GTA 4?
[150:30.23]How do I feel about Grim Fandango?
[150:41.23]That's a good ol' game.
[150:42.77]I've played through it a couple times though.
[151:05.25]God, this is gonna make me sick.
[151:16.67]What about the Neverhood?
[151:18.77]I thought about playing the Neverhood a long time ago.
[151:21.55]But... This is before Armikrog came out.
[151:27.67]I was really excited for Armor Crog because Armor Crog was by the same group that made the Neverhood.
[151:33.21]It was a Kickstarter project.
[151:35.03]And it was okay.
[151:37.45]If I'm honest.
[151:42.57]No!
[151:51.15]It was okay.
[151:52.55]I don't think they could capture the same kind of magic they had with the Neverhood.
[152:05.51]Dude, how do you... Do you have to turn the game board sideways to go through that?
[152:08.91]How do you go through that thing?
[152:11.95]Do they just turn it sideways just to say, fuck you, you'll never beat the game?
[152:26.49]This is a... What is this?
[152:35.03]Okay, this one looks awesome.
[152:37.69]We unlocked a mini game.
[152:45.51]Ooh!
[152:52.28]Let's check that out.
[152:55.16]I'm gonna piss.
[152:56.78]I'll be right back.
[152:57.52]I gotta pee.
[156:01.30]Alright, I'm good.
[156:05.50]Got some water.
[156:07.92]Happy birthday.
[156:08.58]Hey, thanks a lot.
[156:09.16]Appreciate that.
[156:11.50]Oh, by the way, I want to talk about it.
[156:12.92]I'm not doing a birthday stream.
[156:18.97]I'm going to take tomorrow and probably the next day off.
[156:24.27]I'll be back on Thursday of this week.
[156:27.23]Thursday and Friday are going to be interesting because Thursday, the Left 4 Dead 2 new community campaign thing comes out.
[156:37.39]Going to be playing that with Joel, Tyler from Valve News Network, and SimpleFlips.
[156:46.42]That's sort of the plan tentatively right now.
[156:50.36]I'm kind of rusty at Left 4 Dead, but I think I still got it.
[156:54.21]And then on Friday, Friday of this week, I'm going to be a guest on Kit Boga's stream.
[157:01.66]I've been messing around for a couple of hours.
[157:10.80]That should be fun too.
[157:15.26]I don't know what the exact plan is, but I just know that that's going to happen.
[157:22.33]It's a double pog moment.
[157:23.77]Yeah.
[157:25.60]Well, thanks for the birthday wishes.
[157:26.60]I've seen some of the things people are already making.
[157:28.42]It means a lot.
[157:30.78]Thank you.
[157:33.08]But yeah, no stream as of tomorrow or the next day.
[157:36.86]I'll be back Thursday and then Friday.
[157:38.03]I'll probably stream on Saturday too.
[157:42.25]Let's keep going.
[157:43.29]What happened?
[157:43.87]Where is it?
[157:44.83]Did the game crash?
[157:49.01]I think, yeah, it's crashed.
[157:50.31]When was the last state?
[157:52.32]I don't know.
[157:59.55]No, yeah, Left 4 Dead should be fun.
[158:01.44]It's been a very long time since I've played it.
[158:03.14]That link is funny.
[158:16.10]Is it?
[158:18.56]Alright, let me slow down here.
[158:26.67]We're going.
[158:27.53]Don't go that fast.
[158:28.23]Alright.
[158:28.55]You go much faster than the thing spins.
[158:33.63]AI dungeon.
[158:35.49]Give me a minute.
[158:37.51]Still not done.
[158:42.31]Jesus.
[158:42.75]I don't think it should be happening like this.
[158:46.31]I don't think it's supposed to be like this.
[158:50.27]Where's the goal?
[158:50.87]Wait, am I supposed to switch sides?
[158:52.07]Oh, okay.
[158:54.17]Okay.
[158:57.23]I... I get it.
[158:58.01]I'm going the wrong way.
[159:01.33]Oh man, that was gonna be so hard.
[159:11.94]Okay, you gotta get in each individual thing.
[159:14.02]Fuck.
[159:16.86]This is tricky.
[159:25.62]Ugh.
[159:29.43]Happy 39th birthday?
[159:30.56]Not that old.
[159:32.44]Not that old.
[159:36.62]Close though.
[159:38.64]You are close.
[159:41.19]Fucking game crashed again.
[159:42.15]45?
[159:47.49]No, not 45.
[160:06.51]This is my own fault, I keep doing it to myself.
[160:08.51]But, you know, anything to get through expert, right?
[160:12.08]Anything.
[160:15.68]He'll do anything to get through expert.
[160:19.76]Where's the save?
[160:29.91]No, not gonna happen.
[160:43.01]Get in it!
[160:43.59]What the fuck, dude?
[160:54.50]You can both ways before you cross the fucking road?
[161:12.86]I would have already eaten the controller if I was 13 and I played this.
[161:16.59]The controller would have been part of a fucking soup.
[161:18.81]I would have chopped it up into a bunch of pieces and put it into my stew.
[161:39.04]Come on, dude.
[161:40.20]What the fuck?
[162:16.24]That's so stupid!
[162:21.22]I already blew it.
[162:22.04]If I blew it, it's already over.
[162:38.87]I keep going backwards because the save state was done and crashed the game.
[162:49.79]Get in there!
[162:50.33]Gotta reach into the diaper and get some quarters.
[162:59.24]I do agree with you, that would be fucked up if I reached into my diaper to get quarters.
[163:03.87]But... Wouldn't really be that big of a deal.
[163:07.09]If it was over the pants.
[163:31.75]Alright, how do you... How the fuck do you do this one?
[163:38.82]It just dumps you.
[164:06.07]Stay in the middle.
[164:06.89]No, that's not going to work.
[164:16.65]Right up the side.
[164:17.37]That's what I was trying to do before.
[164:22.13]Just holding left.
[164:39.11]Go slower?
[164:39.87]I don't think it's slower.
[164:41.68]That wouldn't that?
[164:45.50]No, I can't.
[164:46.10]It's not going to go slower.
[164:49.70]Built the stage with the other analog.
[164:51.73]I don't think that works.
[165:02.23]Stay on it.
[165:10.92]and I don't know what it was.
[165:11.94]I'm trying to stay all the way to the left, but it just dumps you.
[165:35.96]Stay!
[165:40.20]But if I get on the edge, he just falls off.
[165:43.36]I can't even get on it.
[165:44.06]Okay, it just... What happened there?
[165:54.81]Why did he flip over?
[165:55.95]You can't fall down.
[166:06.32]Killed the GameCube.
[166:13.19]Don't ever push right.
[166:14.67]I haven't once.
[166:17.03]I'm only holding up or left.
[166:19.97]Like I'm holding left right now.
[166:27.56]Hold right instead.
[166:33.58]I'll try right side.
[166:46.43]You think it's broken?
[166:47.23]I don't think so.
[166:47.93]I think it's just... I don't know.
[166:48.91]I think it's just being weird.
[166:59.24]Why did I... Is somebody at the secret exit behind the star?
[167:02.78]Sure there is.
[167:04.15]Why did I listen to you?
[167:04.83]There's nothing here.
[167:08.31]You're lying.
[167:17.38]You have to tilt right to tilt left.
[167:23.19]Like in the movie Cars?
[167:26.95]What are you talking about?
[167:28.27]Yeah, remember in the movie Cars when, uh... When Flash lightning...
[167:47.81]Goes over the tutorial of how to play Monkey Ball.
[167:55.22]Turn right to go left.
[167:58.14]Yeah, but if I... You don't understand.
[167:59.70]I can't... Go faster.
[168:07.87]There is no faster.
[168:09.57]Look at the real estate that I have.
[168:11.45]I can't build up any speed here.
[168:23.79]We tried to stop going forward while just pushing left.
[168:25.99]That's actually a good, that's a good call.
[168:27.79]That's not a bad idea.
[168:30.52]Just like, just hold right.
[168:32.06]You know, like just... That might actually work.
[168:34.84]Hold on.
[168:39.25]No.
[168:48.45]I think you really do just have to stay right on the edge here.
[168:51.19]But once it starts to go that far up, you just can't go anywhere.
[168:54.57]Start on the lower side and move forward and towards the higher side to have more momentum upwards.
[169:07.97]Like slide down and then up.
[169:10.21]This is too much for my fucking toddler brain to do.
[169:37.79]And you surf like a wave.
[169:39.37]Um, I don't know.
[169:43.36]You can flip the board over if you stay on one side, then it will stay flat.
[169:51.14]How much time does it actually take to go through the whole cycle here?
[169:54.24]Oh, see what happens?
[169:56.44]It goes like, dump!
[169:57.90]Right at the end.
[169:59.10]It does like a little dump at the end.
[170:01.60]There's a little more momentum right at the end.
[170:03.16]Hmm.
[170:13.85]I picked the worst character for this.
[170:15.26]Guys, I didn't know that the Monkey Ball characters had different stats.
[170:20.18]Isn't that not even right?
[170:31.77]See, if I try to pull a hard left, it just doesn't matter.
[170:35.95]You go over or it dumps you anyways.
[170:42.02]Just watch the speedrun.
[170:43.53]No, I don't want to be embarrassed.
[171:00.72]Use the speedrun strat.
[171:02.08]What's the speedrun strat?
[171:07.83]I'm curious.
[171:08.73]I feel like this one... I don't understand this.
[171:10.73]Yeah.
[171:13.03]It's so funny.
[171:14.09]You're making me cry laughing right now.
[171:16.65]It's absolutely hysterical to me.
[171:24.95]It is.
[171:25.35]Okay, it is.
[171:26.49]I'll be honest with you, it is.
[171:27.87]It was pretty funny.
[171:39.24]You're doing the same thing over and over and you're expecting different results.
[171:44.91]Yeah, but what else am I supposed to do?
[171:48.96]I'm trying just to hold.
[171:50.08]You can't.
[171:51.94]I think this is the end of the game.
[171:57.72]What if I don't move at all and just hold left?
[172:02.43]No.
[172:05.31]Actually, just stay in the middle.
[172:06.67]Yeah, you can't though.
[172:19.54]Uh, what?
[172:28.09]Give me the link.
[172:28.57]Let's see how to beat this dumbass level.
[172:32.15]How do I beat it?
[172:35.13]Super Monkey Ball, Expert 18.
[172:36.15]Okay.
[172:37.59]What the fuck is going on here?
[172:49.30]Okay, so he... It's when it starts to tilt over to the right, he runs down and then... Let me try this shit.
[173:08.63]Right when it starts to go down and then starts to move up again.
[173:10.71]Here we go, like now.
[173:12.91]Fuck you!
[173:20.73]I have to catch it when it's coming back up.
[173:25.83]Like... No.
[173:28.72]No!
[173:29.02]I'm doing what he's doing!
[173:30.56]I'm doing what he's doing, it doesn't work!
[173:35.70]Okay, by the way, the video starts like... He's in the middle of doing something already.
[173:44.10]He's already on the move when the video starts.
[173:47.68]He's already got a bunch of speed.
[174:03.58]I watched the video.
[174:04.14]Alright.
[174:05.67]Hey, look.
[174:06.63]Watch.
[174:06.89]There's still a lot of rushes.
[174:08.31]Check this out.
[174:24.75]Look at all the ads.
[174:30.07]What am I doing wrong?
[174:38.67]What if I just delete?
[174:39.63]I just deleted something on my browser.
[174:44.87]Oh no, I deleted it.
[174:46.45]I deleted the game.
[174:47.51]I'm so fucking angry.
[174:54.35]Hold on.
[175:13.52]I'm pivoting to AI Dungeon.
[175:14.94]I'm done.
[175:15.60]I'm done with it.
[175:16.24]I'm done with this game.
[175:20.22]I'm done with this one.
[175:21.44]Twitter.
[175:36.10]You can see this.
[175:37.90]They're spying on me.
[175:38.74]Get out of here.
[176:03.80]That's what he did in the video!
[176:05.86]That's what he did in the video.
[176:08.40]He went like... You have a different monkey, but how... what... I... I have to quit the game!
[176:27.54]Let me use a different monkey.
[176:28.68]That's stupid when I go through half the game and then it's like, well, sorry, you weren't the monkey you needed to be this time.
[176:34.25]Dragon is the worst.
[176:55.27]Jesus.
[177:06.76]This is literally a disinformation campaign.
[177:16.44]I came here for monkey ball, not monkey bitch.
[177:19.06]Okay, that person deserves a timeout.
[177:21.10]I want that person to get a timeout.
[177:22.96]Like, for ten minutes.
[177:23.82]That person deserves at least a five minute quiet period.
[177:39.12]It's alright.
[177:39.64]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[177:40.50]I'm gonna be fine.
[177:41.24]I'm gonna be- No, I'm not.
[177:53.38]You fucker!
[177:54.54]Okay, here we go.
[178:12.64]That's it.
[178:12.84]That's it.
[178:13.14]That's it.
[178:13.40]That was almost it.
[178:13.96]That was close.
[178:14.44]That was really, really close.
[178:17.38]You gotta catch it at the exact moment that it starts to come on.
[178:21.39]The momentum to go down to up.
[178:25.55]Right now.
[178:28.90]Stupid game.
[178:35.84]No, you stupid game.
[178:56.15]Come on!
[178:57.05]Dude, that's- how the fuck do you do this shit?
[179:31.85]Dude, was this like Mario Maker?
[179:32.99]Did anyone in the office beat this level?
[179:36.05]Or did they just make it and go, that looks good?
[179:37.47]Did anybody do it?
[179:39.60]No.
[179:40.40]Looks good though.
[179:55.88]Put a hand cam on.
[179:57.02]I'm not gonna put on a hand cam.
[180:26.77]Handcam tutorial for this level?
[180:35.25]You're not serious, are you?
[180:38.35]Are you fucking kidding me?
[180:44.59]Dude, this shit don't happen in my game!
[180:46.92]This shit doesn't happen in my game!
[180:49.04]I just fly off the edge!
[180:56.04]I just fly off the edge.
[180:58.62]Okay, I'm going to do exactly what this person did.
[181:00.92]So they land immediately.
[181:02.66]When it's flat, they go to the right.
[181:05.02]They tilt.
[181:05.50]They stay on the right side.
[181:06.53]I've already been off the left edge, by the way, at this point.
[181:14.21]Here we go.
[181:45.38]There is no jump.
[182:09.76]I'm trying to tilt with the...
[182:13.19]You have to bind a key to jump, I'm gonna freak out!
[182:30.81]Dude, I am holding up, holding le- it don't matter, I'm tilting, I'm do- I'm like, I'm finessing, I'm tilting, I'm tilting a little.
[182:39.29]Tilt, doh, whoa, whoa, I fell off the fucking edge, dude!
[183:04.22]Over to the right.
[183:06.12]Okay, I'm going to do this frame by frame.
[183:10.54]They're not even touching any buttons.
[183:11.89]They're holding right.
[183:12.79]Okay, that's what I was doing.
[183:14.77]And then they hold left when it moves.
[183:16.49]Yeah, this is exactly what I'm trying to do.
[183:41.87]I was gonna do the- Okay, ready?
[183:42.76]Just go right.
[183:43.67]Do exactly what they do.
[184:19.39]I'm about to just rip the fucking power button off of my computer.
[184:34.61]You should hit triangle to grind.
[184:43.74]God damn it, dude.
[184:48.54]I have to go fast.
[184:51.56]I'm trying to hold left.
[184:53.42]Hold right.
[184:55.29]I didn't even... This is so ridiculous.
[185:00.29]I didn't even mean to do that this time.
[185:03.47]Hold left.
[185:04.13]Okay, now fucking no.
[185:07.95]I can't do anything else.
[185:11.64]What do you mean finally listen?
[185:12.82]That's what I've been trying to do this entire time.
[185:35.75]No, you piece of shit!
[185:42.92]Alright, I'm jumping off and I'm holding left and forward at the same time.
[185:50.52]If I do that too quickly, I fall off.
[185:57.14]He's dumping me.
[186:12.07]Just go forward.
[186:12.89]It's not going to do anything.
[186:14.95]Just cap the FPS.
[186:16.63]What do you mean cap the FPS?
[186:22.54]What?
[186:37.13]Don't slow down.
[186:38.27]Guys, I am holding forward.
[186:41.65]I'm not hitting back at all.
[186:43.17]I'm only going forward or left.
[186:47.56]I'm not tilting the controller back.
[186:49.32]Why do you think I'm doing that?
[186:50.42]Try doing it backwards.
[187:08.75]This is insane.
[187:10.05]Imagine needing to do this this many times.
[187:19.17]Turn the tilt controls off, what?
[187:48.00]This may be a dumb question, but are you using an actual GameCube controller?
[187:50.88]No.
[187:52.46]I am not.
[188:03.80]Good luck, then.
[188:04.44]What do you mean, good luck, then?
[188:12.13]What do you mean?
[188:13.57]What do you mean, good luck, then?
[188:15.77]What's that mean?
[188:26.87]That's your problem.
[188:28.72]What?
[188:29.46]No, it's not.
[188:30.24]It hasn't been a problem so far.
[188:45.70]How long have I been on this level?
[188:47.66]Probably like 35 minutes.
[188:54.58]Start by going left and turn right to get momentum.
[188:57.87]Yeah, but if I do that too fast, I just go right...
[189:23.48]I know, I got it, I got it.
[189:24.12]This is the one, this is the one, this is the one, this is the one.
[189:26.06]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[189:26.96]I know exactly what to do.
[189:28.20]I got it.
[189:28.66]Trust me, I got it.
[189:29.58]This is fucking the real one right here coming up.
[189:32.79]One of these.
[189:33.29]I know what I'm gonna have to do.
[189:35.35]Check it out.
[189:36.99]I will, I'll get it in a second.
[189:38.21]Wait, one second.
[189:38.77]Give me a second.
[189:56.97]Dude, come on.
[189:58.35]This is so frustrating.
[190:04.13]Just leave this game.
[190:23.58]I can't do that right now.
[190:24.59]I have to beat this level or else I won't be able to sleep tonight.
[190:46.74]Is your FPS capped?
[190:48.14]I don't... Would that even matter?
[190:49.72]I don't think that would really matter.
[190:52.94]What is...
[191:11.16]I feel like the game is just forcing me down the fucking hole.
[191:21.24]Cap the frame rate.
[191:22.38]Cap the frame rate.
[191:23.20]To what?
[191:27.56]Hey, I'm the one that said... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[191:29.91]Hey, I'm the one that said Monkey Ball was like Mario, uh, slope racing.
[191:33.27]I said Monkey Ball 2, not this piece of shit.
[191:44.22]Hey, easy.
[191:46.20]Easy.
[191:46.42]Change monkeys for the love of God.
[191:49.54]But that means I have to lose my everything here, don't I?
[192:00.32]No.
[192:02.88]Redo.
[192:03.48]Who cares?
[192:03.92]Who gives a shit?
[192:06.26]It doesn't matter.
[192:06.92]It's not the monkey.
[192:21.92]I'm trying to do exactly what the thing does in the video.
[192:25.98]They go right here.
[192:27.17]And it's like, boom!
[192:27.93]Now they're tilting a little.
[192:31.83]What did he just say?
[192:38.41]What?
[192:51.19]Physics are based on frame rate.
[192:52.57]Cap your frame rate.
[192:54.17]I won't even fucking tell me that this is all... How do I do that?
[193:03.88]Cap my frame rate?
[193:09.30]How do I do that?
[193:10.64]Graphics?
[193:12.60]Turn on VSync?
[193:21.19]How do I do that?
[193:21.71]De-sync.
[193:31.08]Cap it at 30.
[193:31.42]Anti-aliasing.
[193:35.58]He read my comment out loud and he ignored it.
[193:37.88]I did?
[193:38.16]What do I cap frame rate in?
[193:44.24]Senator... Swordfish.
[193:51.35]Monkey Ball ran at 30.
[193:58.47]You ignored it again?!
[193:59.49]I didn't ignore it again, I didn't even see it!
[194:01.71]Configuration, hold on.
[194:10.25]Okay, well how do I do that?
[194:11.51]That's 16x9 gecko code.
[194:13.21]I don't know what the fuck that is.
[194:14.59]Gecko code?
[194:19.26]Floor 18.
[194:21.13]Original Monkey Ball ran at 30.
[194:23.01]45 on LCD and 50 on a screen projector.
[194:29.49]Go back for fucking boots.
[194:31.11]Can somebody just tell me how- where- what setting- how do I- what box do I check?
[194:35.58]Read this!
[194:36.80]The game carried none of the level design to the sequel.
[194:39.30]2 is a fun racing game.
[194:40.82]This one is a bullshit obstacle course.
[194:44.80]Monkey Ball Torture from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.org.
[194:48.40]Monkey Ball Torture, what?
[194:55.10]Somebody has a tutorial here?
[194:56.28]Let me see it.
[194:57.14]This title does not need... Alright, I'm just gonna find it.
[195:07.55]How do I cap my frame rate?
[195:14.98]If I get a first try after this, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[195:17.06]Alright.
[195:21.42]Tap frame rate.
[195:28.35]Frame limiter.
[195:31.15]Okay.
[195:33.43]Can't seem to find the frame limiter for the... Can somebody tell me?
[195:36.55]It doesn't exist.
[195:40.27]Feature was changed to speed limit.
[195:42.83]Speed limit.
[195:43.67]Okay.
[195:44.28]Okay.
[195:46.74]Look at the speed limit.
[195:48.26]Speed limit!
[195:48.80]There it is!
[195:49.18]Alright, so it'd be 50%.
[195:53.00]That'd be 30 FPS, right?
[195:54.28]Is this the game we're supposed to run?
[196:10.04]Uh, I think this just... Let's just put it into slow motion.
[196:40.90]Hold on a minute, I- wait a second.
[196:47.24]I get it.
[196:47.56]Gah!
[197:16.35]I can't even do it at 30% speed.
[197:19.51]Oh my god.
[197:29.22]A bunch of drugs.
[197:44.52]You piece of shit!
[197:58.87]What the fuck?
[198:07.07]I'm gonna get it!
[198:41.66]Don't go over the edge, little guy!
[199:05.26]No!
[199:39.09]Like, why?
[199:53.45]I'll get it at 50%.
[199:54.37]I almost had it last time.
[200:04.41]Give me the controller.
[200:05.21]Actually, controller issue.
[200:06.48]What?
[200:09.49]Read this, read this, read this.
[200:10.83]Wait, wait, read this.
[200:11.59]Check your modular trombulation.
[200:13.37]Your anti-aliasing is blasted.
[200:15.57]What?
[200:16.47]Read this.
[200:16.79]Don't change the frame rate.
[200:17.79]Turn against the platform when it tilts.
[200:20.33]You keep trying to stay on the edge the whole time, and that's why you're falling off.
[200:24.27]Go to the falling side, and then ramp back up.
[200:30.66]Alright.
[201:05.02]Guys.
[201:05.58]Guys.
[201:06.66]Guys.
[201:07.14]I have to pull the plug.

[207:04.19]Whatever.
[207:04.55]It's still possible.
[207:06.63]I can still do that.
[207:07.33]Shit.
[207:07.59]That was kind of close.
[207:44.39]I believe you and you can beat this level.
[207:46.21]I'm gonna try, man!
[207:47.21]Do it!
[207:51.48]F*** you!
[207:51.90]This is embarrassing.

[208:04.17]I made this for you.
[208:05.21]Okay, here's a... let me see.
[208:08.01]Level 18 expert tutorial, simple.
[208:10.95]It's fart with extra reverb.
[208:13.00]Thanks for making me open a bunch of tabs that I don't want.
[208:15.36]Come on, man.
[208:22.54]Come on, man.
[208:35.88]Come on, it's right there.
[209:01.57]It's so funny because that's like the just do it meme, but I guarantee you there are people that are sitting there watching this right now just actually scream that.
[209:11.50]That angry too, like that upset.
[209:13.88]Guys, help me.
[209:24.72]Help me.
[209:26.41]Help me, please.
[209:27.45]I need help.
[209:28.83]I can't be defeated by this.
[209:30.51]I can't.
[209:31.11]I can't be defeated by this.
[209:32.29]It's too sad.
[209:32.99]I need to beat this.
[209:35.63]This guy sucks.
[209:39.21]No.
[209:39.77]Stop.
[209:40.48]I don't.
[209:41.20]Do I?
[209:41.96]I got maybe a little.
[209:43.06]Fuck.
[209:44.78]Hold on.
[209:47.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[209:49.28]Read this.
[209:51.88]Be in the middle when it's tilting against you.
[209:53.76]Tilt to the higher side.
[209:54.92]I tried that.
[210:00.52]I tried that already.
[210:01.42]Why is this a different game?
[210:09.98]Swing bar?
[210:12.66]Is this the right game?
[210:15.85]This is a different game.
[210:16.79]Is this the right one?
[210:29.85]My quad doesn't look like that.
[210:34.77]This is from a different fucking game, man.
[210:41.61]Stay in the middle, idiot.
[210:43.02]Alright, look!
[210:48.08]You can't stay in the middle, guys.
[210:50.56]You have to be going really fast.
[210:56.77]No, you can't stay in the middle.
[210:59.96]God damn, I almost TAS'd it.
[211:23.68]Turn as little as possible?
[211:26.50]I'm trying.
[211:27.06]It's a waste to gain speed.
[211:29.12]I didn't go to the clock.
[211:31.02]Oh my god, it's been like 45 minutes.
[212:01.24]None of the videos of people doing this use the big monkey.
[212:03.90]I think you need to change.
[212:05.00]Suck up!
[212:14.23]Super Monkey Ball speedrun tutorial.
[212:18.31]Okay.
[212:20.25]Here we go.
[212:20.79]This is an actual video.
[212:24.01]It looks like a real video.
[212:25.29]It was uploaded like five years ago.
[212:27.65]So this is not somebody fucking around.
[212:32.98]Let's see.
[212:41.60]That's what I'm doing!
[213:04.11]The safe way to do this floor is to take the entire thing slowly.
[213:07.09]There are two faster ways to do this stage, and both require holding up at the beginning.
[213:11.51]Isn't that what I'm trying to do already?
[213:12.94]This is a text tutorial.
[213:24.10]Make your way as fast as you can across the bridge, and hold the uphill direction whenever necessary.
[213:29.97]Great advice.
[213:37.52]Momentum glitch.
[213:38.36]Level 18.
[213:44.82]Monkey's in a circle.
[213:45.87]Okay, whatever.
[213:48.03]I'm doing everything that I'm... Alright, I'm gonna turn the music off.
[213:50.07]I'm just gonna try it like this.
[213:57.37]The only thing you have to do here is tilt to the side when it tilts to the side.
[214:01.99]Except that doesn't work.
[214:05.62]I'm holding right right now, and it doesn't do anything, man.
[214:14.52]Before it tilts.
[214:15.88]That's what I'm doing.
[214:17.44]Holding left.
[214:18.22]Tilting.
[214:18.90]Alright, I'm not doing anything.
[214:22.54]Forward right, forward left, forward right, forward left.
[214:25.11]I'm about to put on a hand cam.
[214:27.19]So you can see what's happening.
[214:37.82]I'm convinced he's doing this wrong.
[214:39.52]You can't be convinced.
[214:40.68]No, I don't want to show you my controller.
[214:41.70]It's got a bunch of dirt all over it.
[214:47.40]Hold up.
[214:47.90]There's one with inputs on the screen.
[214:51.20]Yeah, I know.
[214:51.86]I can't believe Sony made that fucking video.
[214:56.54]That's so funny.
[214:58.30]Funny monkey gif.
[214:59.24]100 gecs?
[215:19.96]That was it.
[215:20.50]That was it.
[215:21.20]Everybody relax.
[215:22.85]Nobody move.
[215:23.81]I don't want anybody to move.
[215:25.11]Don't fucking move.
[215:37.90]Shit!
[215:47.85]Fellas!
[215:49.31]Boys and girls, he did it!
[215:50.21]Okay, so like, I like, clementines are so much easier to eat than oranges.
[216:10.11]You know what I mean?
[216:10.69]Like, wait a minute.
[216:11.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[216:13.29]I have to do this, please?
[216:15.05]Okay.
[216:40.88]What's that record on that level?
[216:41.82]What's the record on that level?
[216:42.64]I want it.
[216:43.02]What's the world record on that level without Terms Assisted bots?
[216:49.32]I wanna know what it is.
[217:14.47]17 left.
[217:15.05]Actual world record.
[217:18.84]No.
[217:19.74]Was it?
[217:20.94]I don't know.
[217:22.34]Could have been.
[217:50.69]Wait a minute.
[217:52.12]I missed the world record by 0.02 seconds.
[217:55.78]Did I?
[217:56.64]Holy shit.
[218:02.86]Alright, this one is all over the place.
[218:15.81]So you gotta go run, left, run, right.
[218:18.23]No you don't.
[218:18.73]Just run right down the middle.
[218:23.14]It's kind of just an optical illusion.
[218:52.94]Oh my god.
[219:17.73]I get it.
[219:18.13]You have to.
[219:18.91]Oh yeah.
[219:19.57]Yeah.
[219:19.75]Yeah.
[219:19.95]Yeah.
[219:20.19]Yeah.
[219:20.53]I get it.
[219:20.93]I know what you have to do.
[219:24.12]You have to.
[219:24.64]This is going to suck ass.
[219:33.30]That's going to be hard.
[219:34.19]But you got to keep right on the edge.
[219:35.77]Right on the edge.
[219:36.43]Right on the edge.
[219:45.51]Oh, fuck you.
[219:46.91]He's edging.
[219:47.43]Yes.
[219:48.79]That is how you could describe it.
[220:16.64]Why did you read that?
[220:27.17]You know what that means.
[220:31.31]Let's just move on from that one.
[220:35.75]Are you pretending?
[220:38.97]Yes.
[220:39.11]Let's make it a clean yes.
[220:45.92]Stupid.
[220:56.15]Why am I addicted to this game now?
[220:59.25]Once I overcame tilt level, now I can't stop.
[221:01.91]How many more levels are there?
[221:05.17]Like 30?
[221:06.17]Great.
[221:06.57]I definitely will not get through this.
[221:12.08]Even with cheating, it's gonna be easier.
[221:46.49]Fucking idiot.
[221:47.27]That's so annoying.
[221:57.36]It's like, it makes it harder somehow.
[222:11.36]Make it faster?
[222:17.17]That's gonna be way worse.
[222:18.79]Remember, please wake up.
[222:22.37]We miss you.
[222:34.79]We just need it to be slower.
[223:15.23]Fuckin' game, man.
[223:16.99]This fuckin' game.
[223:19.23]Oh-ho!
[223:22.53]I-
[223:40.83]Ooh, this one's SEGA.
[223:51.33]Okay, that's hard.
[223:54.74]World record?
[223:55.58]I guess the time would be the same, right?
[223:59.74]The time would be a record, but...
[224:11.03]How did I miss that shit?
[224:12.01]Talk slowly?
[224:12.37]Make it seem... Hold on.
[224:13.59]Super Monkey Ball!
[224:14.55]Alright, so if I go this way...
[224:42.04]Will I be able to head over to the other side of the map by now?
[224:51.31]I think I'll be okay.
[224:54.67]I hit my head though, that sucks.
[224:57.62]You can try it again though.
[225:04.81]The game's kind of fun.
[225:05.81]I mean, two is probably... people said two is gonna be better than one.
[225:09.17]That makes sense, I guess, if you want to take both games at face value.
[225:20.66]They have their strengths and weaknesses.
[225:30.05]I fell down again.
[225:31.07]Fuck, dude.
[225:35.78]I'm not very good, but the games have their strengths and weaknesses, so... One is more puzzle-oriented, two is more slide-oriented.
[225:42.98]That's cool.
[225:43.96]What's supposed to happen?
[225:59.21]Well, I can tell you this is not supposed to happen.
[226:02.25]That actually happened.
[226:03.26]Alright, stop fucking around.
[226:04.82]This one's more Dave-oriented, yeah.
[226:08.36]Okay, chill out.
[226:21.27]Why did I think I could do that?
[226:27.26]One is more shitty oriented.
[226:28.78]Two is more puzzle oriented.
[226:33.56]There are a lot of Super Monkey Ball original haters in here today.
[226:36.80]I've noticed that.
[226:37.62]There's quite a few of you guys.
[226:41.50]Is it really that accurate?
[226:58.39]Should I go fast?
[227:00.26]Save it.
[227:00.92]Don't take all games at face value.
[227:04.26]If you have to go much faster than this, I don't know.
[227:08.82]How do you get over there?
[227:28.46]Shit, like that.
[227:31.24]Whoa!
[227:32.46]I'm not softlocked.
[227:34.61]I'm fine.
[228:07.61]Oh shit.
[228:09.13]Wait, what just happened?
[228:15.86]What?
[228:15.98]What happened?
[228:17.76]What did I just do?
[228:19.08]Is it connected?
[228:22.20]It wasn't connected.
[228:34.57]How do I hop over from here to there?
[228:38.32]Got it.
[228:58.21]Ooh, this one looks real good.
[229:06.51]This one we can just brute force, I think.
[229:10.54]I would say this one's brute forcible.
[229:38.28]Okay, much harder than I thought.
[229:40.64]Unlimited!
[230:30.68]Somebody wrote, Ultra Gamer Instinct.
[230:37.84]It's like, how does he do it?
[230:38.85]Holy shit, he's a maniac.
[230:41.21]He can do anything.
[230:41.95]He's so good.
[230:44.31]He's so good.
[230:57.14]Okay, hold on.
[230:58.66]What's the world record for the next level?
[231:00.58]I'm curious.
[231:04.48]What is it?
[231:04.80]Can we find out?
[231:07.34]Because I'm going to try to get the time world record.
[231:19.05]What is the record here?
[231:24.29]This one sucks.
[231:32.84]I mean it kind of looks like it.
[231:35.10]Damn.
[231:41.68]No one's ever beaten this level.
[231:48.09]Somebody jumps from the corner of the map.
[231:56.73]Wait, you have to jump?
[231:58.18]Like, there?
[231:58.76]Alright, maybe not this one.
[232:03.46]One that's way more complicated, that's really hard.
[232:05.66]That takes a ton of patience.
[232:07.64]Okay, that turn is hard as shit.
[232:18.82]Actually, it could be this one.
[232:22.42]That's a really sharp right turn.
[232:25.63]Don't be deceived.
[232:35.82]This is not too bad, although I say that now.
[232:37.94]Why does this one suck?
[232:40.84]Everyone was saying, this one sucks, this one sucks, this one sucks.
[232:42.80]Why?
[232:43.04]I mean, I'm just a fucking idiot.
[232:44.70]That's why I fell off.
[232:45.36]That has nothing to do with how hard the level is.
[233:04.03]It's just boring.
[233:05.63]Oh, yeah, I guess it kind of is.
[233:08.93]Just go right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[233:21.50]Shit.
[233:33.87]Time.
[233:37.19]Running out of time, running out of time.
[233:42.24]Holy shit, you have to do this so fast.
[233:46.97]You have to do this so fast.
[234:09.66]Even with the fucking cheating.
[234:24.16]Admit it, he admits it.
[234:26.80]Yeah, what do you think?
[234:28.26]My computer's broken?
[234:36.01]I'm going way too fast.
[234:41.79]Alright, I'm gonna just be 5% faster than I was last time.
[234:50.25]I can do that when the speed is slower.
[234:55.59]Take it slow, I'll be good.
[234:56.63]I have way more reaction time.
[235:08.14]And I fucking fell off.
[235:08.94]I knew it was gonna fucking happen.
[235:10.20]I knew it was gonna fucking happen.
[235:11.28]I knew it.
[235:11.58]I'm just gonna start save-stating.
[235:12.50]Fuck this level.
[235:13.00]This place sucks.
[235:25.95]I just looked at chat.
[235:26.65]I just read chat for no reason.
[235:28.08]Why did I do this?
[235:29.20]Just...
[235:54.06]Oh shit, leaked!
[236:03.49]Get that off the screen!
[236:05.25]Get that off the fucking screen, mate!
[236:07.01]What are you fucking doing?
[236:27.91]Alright, it's not even- why won't it take that window?
[236:30.22]It won't take this other window now, why?
[236:34.48]Alright, we're good.
[236:52.27]Oh fuck, that game starts.
[236:53.50]Okay, right.
[236:55.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[236:56.70]Okay, look.
[236:57.64]We already went over this.
[236:58.60]That was a screenshot for Dave.
[237:02.14]He wanted me to take a screenshot.
[237:03.84]You know, that was a screenshot from Dave to me.
[237:06.98]He's like, dude, hey, these are my list of things that I'm trying to get to work.
[237:09.62]Can you help me?
[237:10.90]I'm like, alright, man.
[237:11.62]I will eventually.
[237:12.48]Maybe a little later or something.
[237:13.58]I don't know.
[237:16.34]That was a screenshot from Dave to me.
[237:18.42]Don't fucking leak it again.
[237:20.05]My computer crashed.
[237:31.52]Leaked.
[237:31.84]Where does this press play on Mad World right now?
[237:41.22]No.
[237:41.50]I have a disk right behind me.
[237:45.41]I got the controller.
[237:46.59]I got the system.
[237:47.29]And I, you know, I can, my, I, uh, look at you.
[237:51.31]I own everything.
[237:52.05]I own everything.
[237:52.63]I own them all.
[237:53.13]I own everything.
[237:54.57]They're in the house right now.
[237:55.29]They're right behind me.
[238:14.96]What's with the weird dust filter that's on this?
[238:17.04]I don't like that.
[238:21.93]Alright.
[238:23.47]I just have to get up there with an extra five seconds left.
[238:27.03]Damn it, man.
[238:29.37]I don't know how much more of this shit I can take.
[238:43.73]What'd I say?
[238:45.57]What'd I say?
[238:46.03]What'd I do?
[238:49.15]Fucking hard turns, dude.
[239:01.60]Oh, come on, man.
[239:09.02]Fuck this.
[239:22.49]Aw, fuck this.
[239:23.19]Screw this.
[239:23.75]Fuck this game.
[239:24.45]Fuck this level.
[239:26.17]Still here.
[239:27.93]Still playing it.
[239:28.55]Whatever.
[239:51.25]I have to put it on slow motion.
[239:58.72]It's the only way I'm gonna do it.
[240:02.76]It's the only way it's gonna happen.
[240:03.88]I'm sorry everybody.
[240:05.95]I'm sorry.
[240:08.25]This has to happen.
[240:17.23]I apologize.
[240:30.06]The original game does not have slow motion.
[240:37.45]Yeah, well... He didn't get you a copy from a guy in the back of his van.
[240:45.68]that was burned onto a CD-R.
[240:53.58]Oh my fucking god.
[240:55.36]You talk a lot of bad game for a little guy.
[241:20.90]How can I still screw this up?
[241:25.26]Actual worse voice.
[241:26.21]Isn't that what it was?
[241:27.37]Doesn't know what it does.
[241:28.55]It's like, are you talking about that?
[241:32.35]Yeah.
[241:32.45]People are giving money.
[241:46.56]Captain Squiggle, thanks for the 10.
[241:48.30]Good meeting you.
[241:48.70]What's up?
[241:50.35]I think so, seriously.
[241:56.51]I do it every time, even in slow motion.
[241:57.85]I fucking swear to God, I'm about to rip the game up.
[242:00.51]I'm about to pull the game out of the theoretical GameCube.
[242:06.96]I'm theoretically pulling the disk out of the GameCube tray in my mind.
[242:14.84]What's a good speed to do?
[242:15.76]Like 20 miles per hour?
[242:16.88]I think 20 is good.
[242:18.36]I can take corners easier that way.
[242:30.38]If I stay at 20, we're good.
[242:47.17]Irma, stop underclocking your GameCube.
[242:58.12]Dude.
[243:00.90]Stay at 20.
[243:01.34]Stop reading chat, finish the level.
[243:13.15]I am.
[243:29.89]Okay.
[243:33.65]I'm so fucked up right now.
[243:37.69]Dude, stop.
[243:38.47]I'm not doing anything.
[243:39.33]I'm just fucking saying a word.
[243:41.87]What?
[243:42.05]Okay.
[243:42.49]Can I say, oh, you talk a lot of big game.
[243:45.93]Just as me?
[243:46.53]Or is that off limits forever now?
[244:07.29]Is this... Am I even still going to actually be able to finish this?
[244:11.91]Even with the super slow-mo and going like 20?
[244:24.37]It's going to be close.
[244:25.03]I might get it.
[244:25.81]Fuck that turn.
[244:31.49]Alright, then we're just going to... We're going to full blast here and then full blast here.
[244:35.05]We got... No, I definitely have it.
[244:48.71]Ball blast.
[244:54.72]Five.
[245:00.20]Four.
[245:00.44]Don't go that fast.
[245:03.51]Still have to go through the gate.
[245:15.00]Doesn't it feel weird?
[245:17.55]Feels like the game's wrong.
[245:18.89]This one looks cool.
[245:28.22]This one's cool.
[245:28.98]I like this one.
[245:30.60]You gotta do Tony Hawk momentum.
[245:49.69]That one was just fun.
[245:52.03]That one doesn't belong in Expert.
[245:53.71]That one was just fun.
[245:55.58]This is a Mario Sunshine bonus level.
[246:01.32]I already hate it.
[246:26.63]Holy shit, the end is right there!
[246:28.31]Did I miss it?!
[246:41.82]That actually would have been pretty awesome.
[246:45.41]Holy... I can get it.
[246:53.43]fuck oh easy easy slow slow slow slow don't go fast unnecessary I bounce so high
[247:28.39]Stupid asshole.
[247:32.94]And we can't cheat on every single level.
[247:39.56]Not you.
[247:39.98]I'm not talking about you guys.
[247:42.06]Done.
[247:54.74]These are not as hard as the other ones were.
[247:57.02]They really aren't.
[248:02.21]Okay, we're going safe.
[248:02.83]I don't care about the bananas.
[248:11.50]This is going to be horrible.
[248:14.54]Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.
[248:23.36]Is this other side better somehow?
[248:27.68]Kind of.
[248:30.77]Slow down.
[248:37.64]He's still playing this.
[248:38.85]Yeah.
[249:01.51]damn it I didn't I couldn't put my hand on f1 fast enough
[249:37.96]Jesus, man.
[249:38.95]What the fuck?
[249:39.91]Oh, I almost just did it.
[249:48.37]I almost just pressed it.
[249:49.15]Thank god I didn't.
[249:49.71]I pressed 1 instead of F1. ...
[250:07.86]This is dumb.
[250:09.32]No!
[250:11.36]Thank god.
[250:45.97]You know, when this stream first started, I really, really thought you guys were just, like, messing around.
[250:51.55]That there was no way he was going to beat this.
[250:55.40]Right?
[250:55.66]Like, not a single solitary chance in hell.
[250:59.82]And I'm like, what?
[251:00.57]It's Monkey Ball.
[251:01.61]This game's on iPad.
[251:03.37]I had no fucking idea.
[251:18.85]You're literally cheating.
[251:19.79]I'm not saying this is a victory.
[251:50.10]What?
[251:50.58]Come on!
[251:51.56]I hit the goal post?
[251:59.84]What's wrong with my mic?
[252:10.56]I probably fucked it up or something.
[252:25.52]Yeah!
[252:32.44]Hey, what's the world record on that one?
[252:35.94]What's the world record on that one?
[253:03.08]I'm just gonna watch.
[253:07.99]Okay, this is gonna be horrible.
[253:09.91]Okay.
[253:10.63]Nope.
[253:10.99]No way.
[253:11.33]No way.
[253:11.57]You gotta stay on there.
[253:38.13]wait it turns on sometimes wait what is going on here dude I don't do it I don't think this is
[254:13.00]Oh no!
[254:14.08]Alright, we're good.
[254:31.03]What?
[254:31.47]Did I have F1?
[254:32.25]What did I press?
[254:33.91]I don't know what I pressed.
[254:36.25]I pressed Caps Lock.
[255:03.70]It's okay.
[255:04.02]It's alright.
[255:04.38]It's okay.
[255:04.80]It's crashed, but we're good.
[255:06.58]It's okay.
[255:08.10]We're good.
[255:09.58]We're in a good spot.
[255:13.08]I can't imagine playing this legit.
[255:16.64]I'm enjoying this game solely because I'm able to do this.
[255:28.32]The game crashed.
[255:30.30]Yeah, I remember the GameCube games back in the day.
[255:31.90]Yeah, they just crashed all the fucking time.
[255:34.85]I'm fucked up, whatever.
[255:35.71]That's why I lost the console war.
[255:46.07]Good.
[255:55.08]Alright, we're on floor 30.
[256:01.24]Simple bonus floor.
[256:11.22]Only 20 more to go.
[256:13.42]I'll be surprised if I even get through the next 10.
[256:16.13]Let alone the next 5.
[256:16.83]431.
[256:17.05]Is ice in this game?
[256:43.35]And am I waiting for something in particular or... Not that bad.
[257:00.70]This looks pretty bad.
[257:21.11]Oh, this is bad.
[257:22.53]Flo, is this ice?
[257:27.36]Hahahaha
[257:53.34]Okay, I'll be honest with you.
[257:54.26]I was just looking down at my chest.
[257:58.23]I don't know why.
[257:59.04]I just looked at it.
[258:24.75]This but why
[258:50.56]This is a good jump spot?
[258:51.82]Just jump.
[258:52.90]No, fuck it.
[258:54.58]I can't jump.
[259:27.08]Might be time to turn around to Gamer Instinct.
[259:30.35]It's almost Gamer Instinct time.
[259:33.59]Yeah, it's gonna be Gamer Instinct time here.
[260:29.03]Alright, nice.
[260:36.50]Look at how awesome that looked in real time.
[260:44.51]Don't bump into anything?
[260:45.23]This looks okay.
[260:48.47]Maybe not.
[260:48.83]Is that how he sees the world?
[261:05.00]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[261:05.82]We have to get tons of speed around here.
[261:08.24]That's it.
[261:09.91]Yeah, alright, I get it.
[261:10.83]You just gotta fit inside like you're skiing.
[261:17.03]I mean, that's easier said than done, of course, right?
[261:34.41]It's actually pretty easy, is it?
[261:35.73]What am I doing wrong?
[261:42.33]Jump at the start.
[262:17.40]Please jump.
[262:18.40]He didn't... I think I can do it.
[262:25.34]Oh, fucking who cares.
[262:32.77]Let's try to do it normally.
[262:44.88]Get up there!
[262:45.74]Come on!
[262:46.34]No!
[262:47.84]Please!
[262:52.10]If you do this, I'm gonna gift you 5 billion subs.
[262:57.18]Uh, I don't... That would be, like... That would be, like, the entire GDP of, like, New Hampshire.
[263:03.13]So, I don't think you have that.
[263:23.52]25 billion dollars is the GDP of New Hampshire?
[263:25.78]I don't- is it?
[263:26.26]I don't know.
[263:26.66]It might be.
[263:27.02]Look it up.
[263:27.37]I feel like it's like a small enough state.
[263:38.51]Get up there!
[263:39.09]This sucks.
[263:43.22]New Hampshire has a 69 billion dollar GDP.
[263:46.64]Huh?
[263:47.10]That was close.
[263:52.00]If you beat this level, I will gift you 25 subs.
[263:54.03]Hold me accountable, okay?
[264:21.14]I know, I'm trying to get to the corner.
[264:26.86]Remember, if you beat this level, I'll gift you all of my Tesla stock.
[264:32.45]I don't really want it.
[264:50.74]Oh, dude, that dude's about to give me the entire GDP of Canada.
[264:53.94]I'll take it.
[264:54.40]600 billion.
[265:09.71]Jerma, if you beat this first try, I'll give you fucking 500 bucks.
[265:11.60]Oh, really?
[265:12.10]Oh, okay, dude.
[265:13.26]Thanks a lot, man.
[265:13.78]Appreciate the 500 subs.
[265:36.08]This one's going to be horrible.
[265:37.24]Five community subs from Eco Leech.
[265:38.84]That's not 500.
[265:42.96]Nobody actually has to do that.
[265:43.98]I'm fucking around.
[265:44.86]Don't feel like somebody has to do it.
[265:51.51]I guess you just have to just wait.
[265:58.17]I'll take the 20.
[265:58.57]Thanks, Koiki, for the 20 community subs.
[266:01.31]I will definitely take them.
[266:05.44]Appreciate it.
[266:05.84]Thanks a lot.
[266:13.66]We kind of blew through the 30s here.
[266:16.73]I thought I was going to take way longer than this.
[266:38.93]Eat shit dude, this one was hard.
[266:43.27]Eat shit, that one was hard.
[266:44.20]Not you guys eat shit, like this guy in the hamster ball.
[267:04.35]All this with one life remaining, by the way.
[267:06.17]I have to be very careful that I do not accidentally fuck up this save state.
[267:11.47]In fact... Shift F2, right?
[267:21.90]There.
[267:22.12]Okay.
[267:22.68]Do we have to do... Do we get to bounce?
[267:26.06]Do we just bounce over in the...
[267:34.88]The game crashed, if you could guess.
[267:38.08]Good thing I have both those save states.
[267:39.26]The game just crashed.
[267:39.88]Cool.
[267:45.52]Remember when I elbow dropped off the top rope in one of the Jerma Rumbles a couple years ago in the PS4, blue screened?
[267:51.44]That was so disappointing.
[267:53.60]That was one of the worst things ever.
[267:57.89]We had to do the whole rumble again, and it's like, oh, but the outcome's going to be different.
[268:02.45]That was so bad.
[268:18.91]Holy shit.
[268:20.31]I just did it.
[268:20.69]Did I do it?
[268:21.41]I did it fast, but I did it too fast.
[268:25.37]That was fast.
[268:39.09]Nope.
[268:39.51]Take it slow.
[268:55.41]You don't have to be fast.
[268:56.25]You just have to be right.
[269:00.07]Like that.
[269:09.71]I feel like I really kind of went into a groove here in the 30s.
[269:12.81]I want the camera to be facing this way, please.
[269:34.40]Holy shit, they get smaller.
[269:48.26]Damn.
[269:51.54]Just close your eyes.
[269:52.82]I'll take care of this.
[269:53.42]Alright, open your eyes.
[270:04.21]I did it.
[270:13.33]This looks cool.
[270:16.05]Oh, they go... How was I supposed to do that?
[270:21.87]Did I wait?
[270:25.99]Are they gonna slide behind me?
[270:29.03]Oh.
[270:30.43]Did they stop?
[270:33.47]No.
[270:33.59]That was a fun slide level.
[270:36.95]Okay.
[270:41.01]We've made it to the last 10.
[270:44.89]This is 41.
[270:48.57]Almost had it first try.
[270:52.35]Ah, shit.
[270:52.87]One more.
[271:15.54]That's it?
[271:16.04]Alright.
[271:16.26]Good.
[271:16.62]Good.
[271:19.78]Try to beat the next level without looking.
[271:21.00]That's not going to happen.
[271:27.82]Guys.
[271:29.44]One in the middle.
[271:30.28]Skips.
[271:47.83]Be slow.
[271:53.02]What's the rush?
[271:53.68]There is none.
[271:59.18]We don't even need to skip.
[272:07.12]We're fine.
[272:21.92]Oh, okay.
[272:24.92]Do I have to wait?
[272:33.83]Hurry up, dude.
[272:36.05]Oh, shit.
[272:39.81]You gotta go fast.
[272:42.62]Really fast.
[272:49.58]Oops.
[272:55.50]Wait, I have an idea.
[272:56.07]That's gonna work.
[273:03.33]Watch.
[273:28.84]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[273:44.41]Oh, fuck you.
[273:48.71]Ape Escape is a superior primate game.
[273:51.91]It might be.
[273:53.01]I'm sure I'll play it eventually.
[274:14.09]Where is it?
[274:18.21]Shit.
[274:20.23]What the hell was I doing?
[274:28.20]You gotta catch it right when it comes across.
[274:30.04]Okay, one.
[274:31.68]Two.
[274:32.60]Three.
[274:33.62]Four.
[274:34.50]Five.
[274:35.74]One.
[274:36.67]Two.
[274:37.61]Three.
[274:38.91]I'm counting and looking down.
[274:40.23]Do I need to look down at my fingers to count?
[274:42.95]What the hell am I doing?
[274:57.26]And then you go from here to the other one.
[275:06.59]What's going on?
[275:07.05]Am I dumb?
[275:11.81]Am I dumb?
[275:25.54]Hold on, wait.
[275:26.02]I have to go on... Go on this one and you run just forward.
[275:33.49]Okay, I get it, I get it.
[275:34.39]I know what to do.
[275:50.60]Ugh, this game.
[275:54.56]This fucking game.
[275:55.62]Ooh, what the fuck?
[276:15.33]Where is it?
[276:15.93]It's like right underneath me.
[276:27.90]I had it too, fuck you.
[276:37.60]Little bounce.
[276:38.46]Fucking physics, it's stupid.
[276:41.12]This is 2001, physics didn't even exist yet.
[276:44.18]Why does it keep turning me around?
[276:58.78]Gravity didn't exist until 2006.
[276:59.84]Yeah, I know.
[277:02.09]You get it.
[277:02.43]Okay.
[277:11.08]How does this one work?
[277:26.96]This one's very easy, is it?
[277:28.50]Am I overthinking this one?
[277:41.27]Whoa, this one's hard.
[277:44.87]I had it right the first time.
[278:02.50]45.
[278:02.52]Five more.
[278:02.88]We're getting to the end.
[278:04.34]I'm going to beat this game.
[278:05.94]Everyone thought I wasn't going to do it.
[278:49.14]What the fuck am I thinking?
[278:56.43]Save states and slow down.
[278:57.59]Fake game or double fake.
[278:58.93]Whatever.
[278:59.21]I didn't say I wasn't going to play with a handicap on.
[279:12.55]What was the triple fake?
[279:15.46]It was a triple fake?
[279:16.20]What was it?
[279:23.71]Oh, no, I blew it.
[279:24.69]I fucking blew it.
[279:26.59]Why?
[279:54.92]Come on.
[279:56.72]Has to be.
[280:24.43]We're at 46.
[280:25.35]I mean, I don't wanna... I don't wanna toot my own horn here, but... It's been a while since I've activated gamer codes.
[280:48.04]There's a goal!
[280:53.39]What happened to the goal?
[281:01.92]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[281:02.74]Never mind.
[281:35.52]Stupid idiot.
[281:38.58]Get stuck in the roundabout.
[281:39.86]Yeah.
[281:43.02]It's like going into the rotary or the roundabout.
[281:44.78]You just keep going in circles.
[281:45.78]You don't know which exit it is.
[281:47.48]Take the third exit.
[281:48.74]Don't know where that is.
[281:58.49]Shit.
[281:58.73]I don't want to activate any codes yet.
[282:02.82]Not yet.
[282:03.12]I don't need it yet.
[282:04.50]I need momentum first.
[282:20.65]Stupid fucking asshole, I swear to God.
[282:28.73]I keep miscounting how many of these there are.
[282:30.29]There's two more after this.
[282:31.39]I'm in trouble.
[282:40.02]Aye!
[283:00.50]No, I gotta go right.
[283:01.34]I can only go right.
[283:20.60]Do it!
[283:21.40]Fuck!
[283:22.58]Phew.
[283:35.42]You gotta go one revolution here.
[283:37.94]At least.
[283:40.23]And then you gotta slide up into there.
[283:43.09]Oh no.
[283:47.96]It's right there.
[283:48.68]I'm so fucking upset right now.
[284:15.96]I hate, I hate the ones that have like the permanent tilt.
[284:17.98]There's a permanent, just like, big tilt.
[284:24.28]It's the worst.
[284:25.34]I fucking don't want it.
[284:26.28]Stupid, where's the slide game?
[284:29.51]This is not a slide game.
[284:38.49]I have to go around the other level.
[284:40.99]It was a raid?
[284:41.55]I don't see a raid.
[284:43.71]Where?
[284:45.66]There was?
[284:47.62]Oh, there was.
[284:48.06]Alright.
[284:49.60]Thank you, Master Gear, for the raid.
[284:54.78]Welcome, everybody.
[284:55.34]I think the game just crashed.
[285:04.85]Master Gear?
[285:06.29]I say everybody's fucking name wrong.
[285:09.23]Even if it happens a thousand times.
[285:27.46]Get that thing!
[285:28.52]I went backwards?
[285:47.94]Alternate, you dummy.
[285:48.78]Don't call me a dummy.
[285:49.42]You're a dummy.
[286:03.68]Oh Super bait boy Don't tell me to alternate I'm gonna mess me up Oh
[286:24.70]Oh, Super Frog.
[286:27.32]That was it and I fucking messed it up.
[286:49.97]I don't- this one's too big.
[287:00.02]Stop.
[287:00.40]It's fine.
[287:01.38]Come on.
[287:02.46]You're fine.
[287:03.92]You're fine!
[287:04.46]Switch sides on the last one.
[287:19.43]I know.
[287:19.71]I'll try.
[287:27.63]It's hard.
[287:28.01]I can't.
[287:28.43]It's too hard.
[287:30.68]I can't do this.
[287:31.15]That's too weak.
[288:00.10]No child under the age of 12 beat this game.
[288:02.35]I refuse to believe it.
[288:19.26]You laugh at the monkey characters for the first 10 minutes of the game, and when you got at a beginner, you're misremembering.
[288:24.22]You think you, like, beat the game on expert and shit?
[288:26.62]That didn't happen!
[288:28.63]You beat like the first four levels on beginner and then you like had to go to bed.
[288:32.31]And then your parents got rid of these Satanic video games to get out of your life.
[288:52.30]They got rid of them for you because they were bad for you.
[289:09.97]I'm trying to do it right.
[289:11.05]Did I do it right?
[289:15.61]Oh, mama.
[289:25.52]How do you get up this fucking thing, guys?
[289:35.61]Oh, momma!
[289:36.29]Have to do the other ring?
[289:39.69]Yeah, but holy shit!
[289:42.63]I can't even get out of the third ring!
[289:44.57]I can't get out of it!
[289:56.92]This ring right here, you're stuck forever!
[290:07.51]Oh my fucking god.
[290:09.31]It's time to go gamer mode, I think.
[290:10.57]I'm turning on gamer mode.
[290:25.96]What?
[290:26.14]I did it.
[290:46.51]I know how to do it.
[290:50.08]Not like that.
[291:08.17]I feel like this shouldn't be in one of the last levels.
[291:10.25]Ow, my chest!
[291:24.90]What?
[291:43.55]Shit!
[291:44.95]SHIT!
[291:53.71]That was so easy, and I ju- I- that's what I- whatever.
[292:00.34]This is the final three floors!
[292:17.68]Damn it!
[292:18.32]I thought it was going to be a first try.
[292:19.56]So pissed off.
[292:27.53]Oh, I'm tilted now.
[292:28.27]Whatever.
[292:31.31]I was about to be so proud of myself, too.
[292:38.44]Can you please... Like... Why are you doing this to me?
[292:48.67]I have three levels left in the game.
[292:51.37]Stop doing this to me.
[292:53.09]Unfair.
[292:57.67]It's not fair.
[292:58.87]It's not fair, guys.
[293:00.25]I don't know what to say.
[293:01.33]It's not fair.
[293:06.15]Fucking fair, man.
[293:07.27]Like, fucking, I'm just trying to cheat.
[293:12.35]do things you're not supposed to do in the game and like reload the same save file like a thousand times why I want to do what I want I'm putting the engine through hell like what the hell dude this is stupid that was so solid too holy how did I do that the first time
[293:40.17]That was unbelievable the first time.
[293:41.71]I hate... I'm so mad.
[293:43.03]Am I still alive?
[293:46.86]Am I alive?
[293:52.86]Hello?
[294:06.59]I am?
[294:08.23]What happened to my chat?
[294:15.26]Oh, my chat's like broken on this other screen.
[294:17.49]Um, okay.
[294:17.81]Well, I'll just use this screen.
[294:19.95]I looked over at my, um, I have chat embedded over here.
[294:22.71]I was wondering, I was like, holy shit, no one's talking.
[294:28.32]This must be really boring.
[294:31.70]I see, you know, alright.
[294:32.58]It just like turned off for some reason.
[294:33.88]Here we go.
[294:44.58]Dammit.
[294:45.00]That first try... That first try was so good.
[295:10.71]Your cam is on.
[295:12.07]Bleh!
[295:14.48]See that?
[295:59.77]I'm making plenty of, uh, like, tantrum noises this stream, too.
[296:02.69]I hate- I don't want- I- I always hate that.
[296:06.09]I'm like, It's like, okay, dude, like, really?
[296:11.00]You're playing, like, GameCube right now.
[296:13.50]You're not, like, sinking in fucking quicksand.
[296:15.64]Like, it's okay, just relax, Jeremy.
[296:17.56]You're fine.
[296:19.20]You're good.
[296:41.55]It's just a GameCube game.
[296:43.13]It's just a GameCube game.
[296:44.37]It's not like your mouth is being filled with fucking acid.
[297:03.10]This one is actually really fucking hard.
[297:13.66]This one's tricky as hell.
[297:20.19]There's not going to be AI Dungeon, is there?
[297:22.15]Um, probably not at this point because I'm about to beat the game.
[297:26.35]When I beat it, I'm going to end the stream immediately.
[297:33.60]The second that I cross the goal, I'm going to turn upstream.
[297:41.39]What about the mini-games?
[297:42.27]Oh, no, you're right.
[297:42.95]Never mind.
[297:43.94]I'll try them.
[297:46.18]Get there first.
[298:16.54]Gamer sense activated.
[298:27.40]Give me the fucking goddamn gamer sense.
[298:39.72]This is why you never tell me to do save states, because we end up in situations like this.
[298:44.42]Whatever the word is.
[298:45.02]We end up in a situation where it's impossible unless I do save states over and over again.
[298:51.25]Then I get addicted to it because I have never-ending continues.
[298:55.86]And I get trapped here forever.
[299:14.30]Easy easy Come on dude, don't
[299:48.71]Go in!
[299:54.93]Okay.
[299:59.43]Two more and we're done.
[300:00.27]Look at this.
[300:01.51]Oh, this is an easy one.
[300:20.77]Why don't I just do that?
[300:30.38]Okay, what's the world record on that one?
[300:44.10]This is the last level.
[300:55.20]Oh shit.
[301:00.91]Okay, we're good.
[301:03.13]It's actually really not that hard.
[301:08.82]Final floor.
[301:12.58]What are you supposed to do here?
[301:25.10]Okay, um... It's going too fast.
[301:39.80]You just have to roll around.
[301:40.74]Okay, I get it, but...
[301:53.93]And I only had to cheat four to five hundred times.
[301:57.24]I can unlock some more mini games.
[302:09.14]There is the Dole Trophy.
[302:10.62]Hooray, I did it.
[302:12.06]That was fun.
[302:15.78]That was a cute little game.
[302:23.10]What's in the doll?
[302:24.30]Isn't the Donkey Kong in this way too?
[302:25.77]I'm the one that did all the work.
[302:36.31]Let me in.
[303:03.17]Alright.
[303:04.83]Super monkey ball.
[303:05.49]Alright, let's do the... Here comes the subs.
[303:15.20]No, we're not doing it.
[303:17.80]I can just skip it.
[303:20.22]That's good.
[303:20.50]You're going to give subs again, you liar?
[303:26.49]No, because I had negative last time.
[303:35.81]Did I have 29 bananas?
[303:48.16]Whatever.
[303:48.44]It's the first to be zero.
[303:49.96]29.
[303:50.60]Alright, fine.
[303:53.08]Fine.
[303:55.84]No, that's true.
[303:56.63]You got me.
[303:59.93]No, you got me.
[304:00.55]That's true.
[304:01.73]You got me.
[304:02.39]Let's play a couple minigames.
[304:14.11]29, right?
[304:20.55]How am I not following my own channel in that?
[304:23.32]Oh, you can't.
[304:23.74]Alright, let's do some, uh, gift to sub.
[304:31.80]Gift.
[304:33.39]29 subs.
[304:36.09]Here you go, you ready?
[304:39.69]You've given 901 gift subs to the channel so far.
[304:43.41]Totally.
[304:44.41]Oh, wow.
[304:45.77]This is kind of a lot.
[304:47.67]Alright, here we go.
[304:49.09]29 subs.
[305:01.48]And there they go.
[305:13.54]Okay, minigames.
[305:16.11]Monkey billiards.
[305:20.49]Monkey bowling or monkey golf?
[305:22.55]You can only do two.
[305:24.41]What?
[305:25.25]I mean, monkey billiards.
[305:26.69]I don't like billiards.
[305:27.39]Let's do monkey bowling first.
[305:30.52]Okay.
[305:43.94]Wait, you actually bolt?
[305:48.02]Okay, let's go here.
[305:51.56]That's a strike.
[306:12.46]That's a strike right there.
[306:13.54]I'll take it.
[306:15.22]Actually, technically, that's a spare.
[306:16.44]Let's do it again.
[306:27.69]Shit.
[306:27.99]Alright, spin.
[306:29.39]Tons of spin.
[306:34.65]Too much spin.
[306:35.36]Way too much.
[306:35.78]Alright, it's alright.
[306:38.44]I'll get the spare.
[306:42.07]All you have to do is knock them all down.
[307:11.62]Kind of fun.
[307:13.04]I get it now.
[307:13.50]I see what they want you to do.
[307:23.28]Just a little bit, so it'll curve.
[307:24.30]Is that too much?
[307:27.06]No, it's good.
[307:33.54]The other bowling mode.
[307:37.24]I want to do what the professionals do.
[307:41.07]This shit.
[307:41.49]You know what I mean?
[307:46.53]Where they get it right in the edge and it just curves right the fuck in and strike.
[308:09.00]He's fucking dead.
[308:13.39]I don't want to do 10.
[308:14.13]I don't want to do a false string here.
[308:15.77]I want to do the thing I want to do at least once.
[308:22.08]Shit, I'll get it.
[308:22.68]I just want to do it one time.
[308:29.61]It's not going to do it.
[308:37.31]Right, you're right.
[308:38.41]I can just... I can turn on the gamer's sense.
[308:41.47]What am I doing?
[308:43.61]I should be able to get a strike every time.
[309:03.93]Alright, look at this.
[309:04.49]This is going to be awesome.
[309:05.37]It's going to be like boom!
[309:07.67]Strike!
[309:31.02]Okay, what if I...
[309:36.77]Gamer instincts don't matter.
[309:37.77]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[309:43.47]Gamer sense might matter if I do this.
[309:45.85]All the way over here.
[309:46.69]Have it go all the way to the left.
[309:49.68]Tons of power and all the way spin to the left.
[309:52.08]There it is.
[309:57.24]Oh, that's a beauty.
[309:59.62]Yes.
[309:59.96]Oh, it would have been so cool a little bit less.
[310:12.00]A little bit less.
[310:12.62]We'll go all the way over here.
[310:13.58]A little bit less power.
[310:20.67]This should do it.
[310:29.53]Nice.
[310:30.81]Nice.
[310:31.07]I feel satisfied now.
[310:32.94]We can stop.
[310:42.94]Oh, look at me!
[310:43.86]Look at me!
[310:46.14]I'm done with this one.
[310:51.72]Uh, we got golf.
[310:54.16]Number of holes.
[311:10.11]uh whatever 18 holes why would they make 18 holes it's part three is it just mini golf oh this is awesome
[311:38.86]Why can't I just have played this the whole time?
[311:40.56]What happened?
[311:58.39]Let me try to get a hole in one and then I'll be happy.
[312:09.69]This is cute, though.
[312:11.15]This is cute.
[312:12.53]It's cute.
[312:13.21]It's cool.
[312:18.53]Okay, I'm going to hit her as hard as I possibly can.
[312:24.45]Just smash it.
[312:27.39]How many times did you do that in mini golf, by the way?
[312:37.58]I remember going mini golfing.
[312:40.02]and you do it a little too hard and it would just bang bang bang bang bang would skip over into there'd be another family playing and you're like the turquoise ball would just roll down and knock into two or three of their balls and ruin their day
[313:03.18]I was so bad at mini-golf, I hated it.
[313:06.31]I always hit it too hard.
[313:07.47]And even when I- ugh, I hated it.
[313:09.57]It drove me nuts.
[313:13.85]All in one, I get a thousand, uh... points.
[313:22.86]Who hates mini-golf?
[313:24.08]It just enrages me, I don't know why.
[313:36.41]To me, it's the worst part about golf.
[313:39.44]Dialed up to 1,000.
[313:40.06]It's like, hey, you know this really difficult, really impossible thing that takes too much skill to do?
[313:46.66]We're going to put a windmill in front of you now.
[313:52.63]No.
[313:53.37]You give me a two wood and a driving range, I could crush those balls like Happy Gilmore style.
[314:12.28]Dude, I used to just drill balls at a driving range.
[314:17.98]It was such a flex, too, because you would go there with people that have no idea what the hell's going on, and they're, like, doing a weird form, and the ball rolls down, like, 20 feet in front of them.
[314:26.41]It's embarrassing.
[314:27.51]I get up there, and I'm just like, Whoa!
[314:30.67]Whoa!
[314:31.87]These are all going like at least two to 300 yards.
[314:34.77]I'm destroying them.
[314:48.62]But anytime anyone wanted to do like a mini golf, it was always, I had something to do.
[314:58.26]Oh, sorry.
[314:58.58]I'm baking a cake with my mother.
[314:59.87]I can't.
[315:03.98]Or it even got to a point, I think, where I would go, but I didn't want to play.
[315:07.32]I wanted to be the scorekeeper.
[315:08.58]Because after a while, it becomes a pain in the ass, too.
[315:16.76]When you get to, like, hole 7 or 8 in mini-golf, aren't you kind of fucking over it?
[315:24.57]Like, an hour or two will go by, and it's, eh, I'm kind of over this.
[315:32.13]And then you just start dragging the ball with your club.
[315:37.58]Like, oh, yeah, my turn.
[315:38.88]Okay, there's like six of us here.
[315:40.60]My turn.
[315:41.06]Alright, well, just drag a little bit and let go.
[315:44.98]I don't care where it goes.
[316:04.38]You like regular golf?
[316:05.32]I only like the driving part.
[316:06.62]That's it.
[316:13.69]I love just smashing balls, like a bucket of balls, and just watching them soar.
[316:17.29]Alright, that's it.
[316:30.84]I, uh...
[316:38.19]That was fun.
[316:39.67]That's where I'm going to call it.
[316:44.03]So, let's go over a few things.
[316:46.39]A couple of important things.
[316:48.73]Thursday is the next stream.
[316:50.16]It's going to be Left 4 Dead 2, the big community update.
[316:52.62]Joel B. Tyler from Valve... I almost said Valve Sauce.
[317:02.66]Valve Sauce, yes.
[317:05.99]And SimpleFlips.
[317:08.59]I'm gonna be doing the Left 4 Dead stuff.
[317:13.66]Should be a lot of fun.
[317:15.68]That's the plan for Thursday.
[317:17.16]And then Friday, I will be on Kit Boga's stream as a guest.
[317:24.22]I'm gonna get kind of implanted into that world for a day.
[317:26.68]That is Friday.
[317:31.08]I believe at somewhere early afternoon, I think.
[317:36.35]I'm like 2 or 3 Eastern, maybe?
[317:37.87]I don't think we've locked it down completely yet, but it should be a lot of fun.
[317:42.95]What the hell kind of golf course is this?
[317:46.43]We're going full power right here.
[317:53.06]What time on Thursday?
[317:54.38]The normal start time, probably around noon.
[318:00.08]There are three other people that we have to kind of communicate with, though, so that could change.
[318:04.60]I would just keep an eye on the sus over the next day or so.
[318:09.42]I'll have it locked in time.
[318:10.26]And that's going to be it.
[318:18.67]You can call it here.
[318:40.25]I don't know.
[318:40.71]What?
[318:41.49]Oh, wait.
[318:41.71]What about one of the party games?
[318:43.55]Monkey Fight.
[318:50.65]Number of wins.
[318:51.51]One.
[318:53.41]We're going to battle on Final Destination.
[318:58.74]Monkey Target is so good, dude.
[318:59.94]Alright, I'll try it.
[319:20.25]Oh, I got big.
[319:29.33]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[319:31.67]Power up.
[319:37.84]Even bigger.
[319:39.84]Holy shit, this is huge.
[319:42.18]It's too big.
[319:45.30]Shit, I lost.
[319:48.10]I don't want to play it anymore.
[319:49.12]I don't like it.
[319:59.51]A monkey target.
[320:03.23]Wheel of danger.
[320:04.19]Uh... What are we looking for?
[320:17.32]Bomb?
[320:18.76]Safe.
[320:19.46]Safe.
[320:32.98]Kind of cool.
[320:40.01]Number of laps.
[320:42.53]Uh, one.
[321:10.22]A.V.
[321:17.66]Hey.
[321:29.56]Am I going the right way?
[321:30.30]Am I going the wrong way?
[321:31.12]I'm going the wrong way.
[321:34.38]Shit, I'm doing the thing that happens when you're in last place's toad.
[321:38.83]And all your friends are laughing and you get so fucking mad that you just turn around and start driving into them.
[321:43.74]And it's not even funny.
[321:44.48]You're not making a joke.
[321:45.32]You're actually trying to ruin your friend's night.
[321:51.94]And eventually he gets to the point where it's like, dude, that's, like, stop doing that.
[321:54.82]That's not even cool, man.
[321:55.83]It's not funny.
[322:00.27]Why Toad, though?
[322:00.85]Because Toad is always in last place.
[322:03.75]That's in the game's programming.
[322:05.47]I didn't make that game.
[322:07.49]I didn't make Toad the worst computer controlled player.
[322:09.89]They did.
[322:24.30]It's kind of fun.
[322:24.88]What place am I in?
[322:28.00]Why has nobody done one lap yet?
[322:32.56]One?
[322:38.99]Please go redo target and do it right.
[322:41.11]You have to press A to fly.
[322:47.77]Press A for the speed boost.
[323:10.48]I'll see what happens.
[323:11.06]I can't believe somebody made a video with a fake tutorial.
[323:20.36]That's the best.
[323:21.04]Okay, can I nominate that for best one guy moment?
[323:34.83]I thought it was person.
[323:35.65]Somebody said person A for the speed boost.
[323:47.29]Our cloud's not safe.
[323:50.56]Okay, I'm ready.
[323:51.60]Why did I close it?
[323:54.90]I'm suffocating them!
[324:30.94]Just like Mario, right?
[324:32.46]What am I aiming for?
[324:35.60]The target.
[324:36.04]You have to close it.
[324:39.00]Okay, I get it.
[325:14.01]Right here.
[325:14.39]Okay.
[325:17.89]That's 10?
[325:20.97]Why would it be 10 rounds?
[325:36.04]Alright, if I get more than 10 right now, the game's over.
[325:41.73]I win.
[325:48.09]Head into the pyramid.
[325:54.03]Didn't touch them?
[325:55.11]Round six.
[326:17.44]Game not over, no.
[326:21.12]Did the baby just say, let's-a go?
[326:26.76]Alright, we have to go pretty low to get under these.
[326:42.31]Alright.
[326:55.71]Your career can't get any lower.
[326:57.78]Yeah, my monkey ball career, I'm doing fine.
[327:00.34]What are you talking about?
[327:01.76]I'm okay.
[327:05.22]What do you mean my career?
[327:06.46]What's wrong with my career?
[327:07.32]What are you talking about?
[327:08.06]Yeah?
[327:09.68]Eat that.
[327:14.44]Okay, so very clearly, I need to be very... When you close the thing, it drops like a stone.
[327:22.09]There is no forward momentum.
[327:23.57]The thing just drops like a fucking anchor.
[327:31.70]What's wrong with the clouds?
[327:34.49]Fine.
[327:34.73]You don't want momentum.
[327:43.73]Okay, here we go.
[327:58.08]I just closed a bunch of water in there with a
[328:25.33]Okay, give me some points for God's sake.
[328:27.61]Alright, should I make my descent?
[328:39.65]I think it's time to make the descent.
[328:45.16]That's so fast!
[328:54.73]Look at the wind.
[328:59.29]Oh, there's wind.
[329:04.27]I should have looked to the left of my screen.
[329:26.72]I'll see you Thursday.
[329:28.10]That was fun.
[329:29.94]Here come the subs.
[329:31.76]No, they don't.
[329:32.34]What is this?
[329:33.76]This is not the subs.
[329:38.10]This is not the subs at all, actually.
[329:49.73]I think I saved over the subs.
[329:53.00]It's not good.
[329:55.70]Hold on a second.
[329:57.24]Hold on a second.
[330:01.98]Hold on a second.
[330:08.00]I can get it.
[330:09.82]But I'll see you Thursday, guys, for Left 4 Dead.
[330:17.02]When was the last time I actually opened Left 4 Dead?
[330:21.08]Well, I think it was pretty recently, but actually played a campaign.
[330:25.54]You probably have to go back to one of the old YouTube videos that's on the channel.
[330:30.76]Playing with friends from like 2012, 2013.
[330:33.04]That's probably the last time I did it.
[330:39.11]Alright, let me make sure I can get this...
[330:46.67]Here we go.
[330:47.25]Alright, we're good.
[330:48.87]Crisis averted.
[330:51.05]Here come all the subs today.
[330:51.95]If I can actually get this to run.
[331:07.90]Whoa, here they come.
[331:11.18]Yeah, there they are.
[331:16.21]That's a lot.
[331:19.27]You guys are fading in and out so fast because there were so many.
[331:23.43]Stop doing that.
[331:30.74]Here we go.
[331:35.02]I kind of like this style a little bit because it doesn't just blow by.
[331:37.56]You can actually see the name pop up.
[331:42.93]Although, I think I messed it up.
[331:44.29]I have to make the font bigger.
[331:46.11]That's my fault, though.
[331:46.73]I screwed it up.
[331:47.15]Can I move this?
[331:52.32]No.
[331:55.30]What are you going to do for my birthday?
[331:56.28]I don't know.
[331:57.56]I really have no idea.
[331:58.24]Probably going to dinner somewhere.
[332:02.68]I don't know, though.
[332:06.98]Wow, that was my name.
[332:10.00]That's my name.
[332:17.27]I have to get my music back, too.
[332:19.19]I've got to redo all my stream stuff.
[332:22.43]I need a new computer.
[332:23.29]At least a new graphics card.
[332:24.78]Are the 3080s any good?
[332:27.06]Anyone that has one of the eight that exist?
[332:29.46]Are they good?
[332:35.02]Are they?
[332:35.26]Yeah, we'll do a raid.
[332:38.12]We actually are going to... We'll raid Kid Boga.
[332:40.85]Kid Boga's live right now.
[332:49.53]I'll be, like I said, joining him as a guest spot on Friday.
[332:53.50]So go take a look and see kind of what you can expect.
[333:04.74]More for designers and creators, less for gaming.
[333:08.97]Yeah, but I feel like I could probably, with a better graphics card and a better CPU, I could probably have the stream be somewhere like around 900p.
[333:23.31]And then drop my CPU limit kind of processor down.
[333:29.09]So the stream will just look better.
[333:31.87]That CPU preset, I could put it at slow probably.
[333:38.12]If I got like a 3080 and a, one of the new Threadrippers or something.
[333:44.88]I don't know.
[333:45.28]I'll have to look into it.
[333:48.56]But that was Super Monkey Ball and that's the stream.
[333:54.65]I am very surprised I actually beat it.
[333:56.05]I thought I was going to give up at, like, level 31.
[334:01.89]Go say hello to Kitboga.
[334:04.31]And I will see you all on Thursday for Left 4 Dead 2.
[334:07.88]Have a great night, everybody.
[334:12.08]Take care of yourselves.
[334:13.62]And thank you for the birthday wishes, too.
[334:15.32]I appreciate it.
[334:17.56]An old man.
[334:19.06]Once you cross that mid-30s, now you gotta... Now you're old.
[334:26.42]See you soon.
[334:26.86]Take care, guys.
[334:32.96]Goodbye.
[335:17.80]you
