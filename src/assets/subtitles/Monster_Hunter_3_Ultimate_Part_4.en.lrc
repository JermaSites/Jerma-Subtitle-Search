[ve:61.1.100]

[00:04.43]Okay.
[00:05.85]Let's see if that fixed it.
[00:14.83]Alright, you guys ready to do a test?
[00:16.35]Let's see if it fixed it.
[00:18.63]Here we go.
[00:18.95]Can you tell me if it got any better?
[00:26.29]If not, then... Oh, well.
[00:29.31]That's a fucking shitty Elgato game capture.
[00:31.71]By the way, never buy one of those.
[00:37.30]By the way, don't ever fucking purchase an Elgato game capture device for any reason ever for the rest of your entire life.
[00:46.55]Ever.
[00:47.73]Alright.
[00:48.97]I'm gonna go with... We're on cool drink.
[00:53.31]One, two, three, four.
[00:55.65]Cool drink.
[00:56.66]Baroth Ridge.
[00:57.74]Cool drink.
[00:58.54]Baroth Ridge.
[01:01.10]Did it get any better?
[01:01.70]You tell me.
[01:06.68]Up, down, up, down.
[01:09.56]No, up, up, up.
[01:10.82]Down, down, down.
[01:15.02]We good?
[01:16.76]Alright.
[01:17.70]Fixed.
[01:18.65]See, that's good.
[01:19.61]Worth it.
[01:22.15]But really though, don't ever, for any reason, for the rest of your entire existence, ever even consider buying an Elgato product.
[01:31.81]For the rest of your fucking life.
[01:34.13]Okay, good.
[01:34.77]We're good.
[01:37.23]There's my, like, the... There's the little little shout out there.
[01:43.54]Oh, you got stuff.
[01:51.17]Oh, you have the... You do have things.
[02:02.24]Everyone tells me to.
[02:10.72]RIP Elgato sponsor.
[02:14.01]What do I need to upgrade this?
[02:15.31]Something?
[02:22.73]I definitely like the katana for sure.
[02:24.27]So we can do... I need one more Baroth shell.
[02:28.81]Fuck.
[02:30.13]Oh, that sucks.
[02:32.26]Oh well.
[02:34.83]What about armor?
[02:36.83]Forge armor.
[02:38.25]Chest.
[02:38.49]What do we got?
[02:38.99]Purchase mail.
[02:41.83]Ooh.
[02:44.09]Monopolis mail.
[02:46.01]Ludrith mail.
[02:48.35]Farof mail.
[02:54.63]This is better than what I have already.
[02:55.79]Let's see.
[02:59.47]Don't wait.
[02:59.95]It's in... I do have enough.
[03:09.49]So what's the... Oh!
[03:11.77]Oh, okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[03:16.12]Let's do it!
[03:16.98]Let's do it again!
[03:22.62]Cerberus Katana.
[03:24.54]Ooh, this is gonna be nice.
[03:25.48]This is gonna be nice.
[03:27.32]I just gotta go do some mining and get some more rhinoceroses.
[03:32.96]Let's do some mining.
[03:55.91]Baroth Ridge, let's store that.
[03:57.73]I'm not going to be going there right now.
[04:05.70]Alright, let's go.
[04:07.18]Let's do some crafting.
[04:09.44]Let's do some collecting.
[04:10.44]Let's make some potions, you know.
[04:16.95]We'll do like a mundane quest.
[04:25.51]If it wasn't for the backseating, he'd be using dual bread knives.
[04:29.49]Well, I used the katana in the very... That's the first item I used.
[04:34.18]Everyone was telling me to try out the other weapons, so I was trying everything out.
[04:37.66]And then a lot of people were telling me that the sword and shield is like a really good beginner-friendly item.
[04:42.76]Which... I mean, I'm sure it can be, but... I am enjoying this video game a thousand fucking times more.
[04:52.66]Because I'm using this weapon now.
[04:55.32]So, I think I've found the thing I want to use.
[05:04.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:09.83]Urgent quest.
[05:11.42]Hunt a gobble.
[05:14.36]Not yet.
[05:16.75]Oh, what's like a dumb shitty thing I can do?
[05:18.53]Deliver two Kelby horns.
[05:21.27]Kill some goldfish or something.
[05:22.59]Harvest sandy plains.
[05:27.70]Hunt an Azeros.
[05:34.72]Azeros.
[05:35.22]I don't know where the hell that is.
[05:41.56]Oh shit, the gobble.
[05:43.40]Thank you Laddie596 for the 15 months.
[05:48.57]Fifteen months in a row.
[05:49.21]Thanks a lot.
[05:50.64]Call me Bob Todd for short.
[05:52.06]Thanks for the sub.
[05:53.08]Ellie the Waffle for four months.
[05:55.42]Haven't caught a stream in a while due to work.
[05:57.54]Your Saturday morning streams are the highlight of my week.
[05:59.50]You deserve every penny.
[06:00.50]Well, thank you.
[06:01.38]Appreciate that.
[06:04.81]Perry, thanks for the two months.
[06:07.03]Cigarette Spaghetti Tits for seven months.
[06:12.57]Gonna be going out on a submarine soon.
[06:14.62]See you again on our one year anniversary.
[06:17.47]You're gonna be taking a submarine cigarette?
[06:21.18]That'd be fun.
[06:23.92]Hey, Pigeon Lord, thanks for the sub, dude.
[06:26.24]And ATF gave 10 bucks a couple minutes ago.
[06:29.08]It said, wait, what?
[06:30.38]Or, what, wait?
[06:32.64]Thanks a lot, dude.
[06:34.92]Thanks for the 10 spot.
[06:36.04]10 bucks.
[06:39.64]Spaghetti tits.
[06:46.64]Oh, God!
[06:50.80]No names left.
[06:53.61]Dropped the 10,000.
[06:58.31]One day I'll get spaghetti tits.
[07:00.29]I'm never gonna not call you spaghetti tits.
[07:02.85]But no names left with 100 bucks.
[07:06.33]Thanks a lot.
[07:07.13]Holy shit.
[07:08.01]They say, long overdue thanks for the laughs you've given me over the years, Jerma.
[07:12.97]Well, that's
[07:16.95]Thank you for watching.
[07:18.85]For the years you've been watching.
[07:23.83]That's very kind of you, dude.
[07:25.83]Thank you.
[07:33.40]Clown car.
[07:34.84]Jerma chat is basically sub chat.
[07:37.52]We can get rowdy from time to time, but... Yeah, no names.
[07:40.90]That's fucking... Thank you.
[07:45.40]$100 is $100, man.
[07:45.96]That's a lot.
[07:47.12]That's a lot of money.
[07:54.22]And then right after that, Shieldsy101 gave for seven months, can you please say Wendy's Buck Duck McDouble McBuck Buck McFuck Double.
[08:03.49]Oh yeah, I forgot about that line.
[08:04.51]Well, thanks, man.
[08:05.19]Thanks for the seven months.
[08:07.64]You guys want to get rowdy?
[08:09.66]Whatever.
[08:10.28]I need to just go fucking bug hunting.
[08:12.44]It's like 12 Altaroth.
[08:13.70]I don't even know what those are.
[08:14.80]Who cares?
[08:15.80]Let's just do it.
[08:16.82]I don't even know what they are.
[08:17.60]I don't even know what these are.
[08:19.63]Good luck.
[08:23.45]Where's Kim?
[08:25.73]Kim is currently, I believe, at work.
[08:31.47]She's over here for a few days.
[08:34.77]She's not here anymore?
[08:46.91]Poison, smoke, who cares?
[08:51.91]Who cares?
[08:53.13]That's fine.
[08:53.81]Just eat the ration.
[08:59.60]What do I think about the new gorilla song?
[09:01.74]Interesting that you bring that up because... I don't know.
[09:11.23]Very odd.
[09:13.27]Very odd thing to lead with.
[09:16.26]It's not like a typical gorilla single.
[09:18.18]It's like a guy reading a poem.
[09:22.76]Pretty much for like four minutes.
[09:32.21]Pause the stream.
[09:33.13]Oh, we actually need this stuff.
[09:37.29]I'm a massive... Gorillas are my favorite band.
[09:39.22]I'm a huge Gorillas band.
[09:42.68]Like, all-time greatest favorite.
[09:46.36]It's not part of the album?
[09:49.10]It's what?
[09:49.38]It's just kind of like a random song?
[09:59.45]Just go to the sandy plains.
[10:00.49]I mean, I'm already here.
[10:01.61]I want the, um... What the hell am I even doing back here?
[10:06.01]I don't even know.
[10:07.07]I forgot what I was doing.
[10:12.14]Well, plenty of honey.
[10:13.15]I actually really needed to do this, so I'm glad I'm here.
[10:41.05]Confirmed he likes gorillas?
[10:42.15]Oh, man.
[10:44.01]They're my favorite fucking band ever.
[10:46.13]I love the gorillas.
[10:49.86]Isn't that every gorilla song?
[10:52.54]I mean, there's a lot of weird, sort of poetic, non-music gorillas songs, tracks.
[11:00.59]But for an album that people have been essentially waiting for, for like five and a half years, like that's the song that you lead with, you're like, alright, everyone's so excited, check out this song!
[11:10.01]And it's like, oh!
[11:13.38]It was... I don't want to say it was a bad song, because I don't think it was, I just... I would have much rather the first thing that they show after coming back for years is like something like, like something Gorillaz.
[11:31.85]You know, I'm talking like big gorillas.
[11:33.67]Big.
[11:35.51]Big hit.
[11:36.19]But, you know.
[11:36.81]Looking for a mine now.
[11:45.45]That's your own fault for hyping it up.
[11:48.64]Uh, I'm... No, I didn't really hype it up for myself.
[11:51.84]It just... I don't have any bug nets, fuck.
[11:59.00]Oh my god, get me out.
[12:02.15]No.
[12:02.79]Ah, fuck.
[12:03.61]What a fuck.
[12:04.53]No.
[12:04.95]I thought I left it.
[12:07.69]I took him out.
[12:08.65]I took him out.
[12:09.23]That's my own dumb fault.
[12:11.15]What do I need to kill here?
[12:12.53]What stupid things do I need to kill?
[12:18.04]Altaroth.
[12:18.86]What is an Altaroth?
[12:20.10]Are the bugs Altaroths?
[12:28.51]I don't even know what an Altaroth is.
[12:30.73]But I picked up so much honey, I don't wanna.
[12:34.04]It's these dumb bugs, I think.
[12:37.08]Ants.
[12:42.46]Green ants.
[12:46.18]Alright, Liz is gonna go on a green ant hunt.
[12:51.61]Where's the best place to find these things?
[12:54.11]In the caves?
[12:59.52]There we are, okay.
[13:06.01]I wasn't thinking it was gonna be one hit, but it wasn't.
[13:08.31]Damn.
[13:12.25]You guys take more than two hits?
[13:15.19]What?
[13:18.11]Whoops.
[13:20.77]Gotta kill ten of these things.
[13:28.34]Goddamn.
[13:37.75]Die.
[13:44.41]You just came out of the wall.
[13:45.55]Good for you, man.
[13:50.51]Any others?
[13:51.01]I'll pick up some mushrooms too, why not?
[13:57.77]What FPS does this run at?
[14:00.53]It feels fairly fluid.
[14:12.86]Stop holding forward with your attack.
[14:14.96]I know.
[14:15.90]But that's something that is going to take a lot of time for me to not do.
[14:22.72]Put this away.
[14:29.39]He's going to check on his friends.
[14:36.39]Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.
[14:39.95]We'll wrap around to six.
[14:44.71]Favorite Gorillaz album?
[14:47.29]Probably Demon Days.
[14:49.53]Although, like, something about Plastic Beach I liked a lot.
[14:55.41]Can you get down there, please?
[14:57.91]Go on.
[14:59.12]Don't you usually jump?
[15:01.26]Don't you like to jump into the water?
[15:05.44]I'm going to wrap around to two.
[15:12.12]No mushrooms here.
[15:19.87]The fall was cool because the fall was done on an iPad.
[15:21.84]That's kind of remarkable.
[15:25.62]And it never was supposed to be like a legit album.
[15:31.86]He just did it on the road.
[15:45.22]Mushrooms.
[15:51.01]The fall sucked.
[15:55.66]Yeah, but I... I mean, that whole entire album was free.
[16:00.44]And it was made on an iPad.
[16:15.81]Besides the Gorillas, I don't have any favorite bands, really.
[16:25.08]I listen to a lot of weird shit.
[16:26.68]Just pretty much anything that I like that catches my attention, I will listen to.
[16:32.61]But I don't collect CDs.
[16:33.93]I don't download very much music.
[16:36.11]I don't really have a need to.
[16:37.65]I don't really have a big list of bands.
[16:41.50]I don't even have Spotify.
[16:51.74]Okay.
[16:51.88]Can I pick this up?
[16:52.49]What is this?
[16:55.30]Pumpkin?
[16:56.06]Oh, pumpkin.
[16:59.60]That's my opinion on cake.
[17:06.45]Not a fan.
[17:08.47]Don't like cake.
[17:10.87]Honey's at maximum?
[17:11.81]Okay.
[17:21.83]Bugs?
[17:22.93]I see bugs.
[17:35.43]Gotta be getting close, right?
[17:44.95]I like ice cream cake.
[17:48.85]Ice cream cake is good.
[17:59.70]Glowy thing.
[18:06.11]Just a shitty ration.
[18:12.04]And now we're back in town.
[18:13.00]I got honey and stuff.
[18:14.78]I'm actually going to take a minute or two here.
[18:17.04]I'm going to go to the bathroom and grab another coffee.
[18:20.35]I'm also going to like stuff my face with something because I'm getting hungry.
[18:24.25]But I want to stream until like 9 or 10 o'clock tonight.
[18:31.42]So when I get back in town, I'm going to take a break.
[18:34.34]I will be back.
[18:34.94]Don't worry.
[18:42.23]Coffee in the bathroom, yep.
[18:43.86]I'm gonna brew my coffee in the toilet.
[18:53.47]Bathroom toilet coffee.
[19:01.32]Armorspheres for doing that, nice.
[19:14.48]pee on it and drink it.
[19:16.96]Yuck.
[19:18.74]I will be right back.
[19:22.94]Go stretch a little bit.
[19:26.61]See you dudes in like less than five minutes.
[19:31.03]Just going to make a cup of coffee and pee.
[19:32.63]I'm going to pee in the coffee.
[19:34.83]Here we go.
[21:18.90]Yeah.
[22:43.85]Oh, yeah.
[24:42.93]Okay.
[24:45.73]I'm back.
[24:46.05]Yeah, I want to go for, like, another... At least another few hours.
[24:53.66]Move this down here.
[25:05.19]We're back to reality.
[25:06.91]Uh, thank you, McNinja.
[25:12.89]It's Paddy for three months Raise your eggs.

[25:32.17]What were we doing?
[25:33.38]What the hell were we doing?
[25:40.93]What's the deal with airline food?
[25:42.05]I don't know, ape.
[25:43.19]Thanks for two months, man.
[25:46.27]So I was... Okay, I was gonna make some shit.
[25:54.63]Let's go back to our humble abode.
[26:01.53]Get this going.
[26:05.86]Mega potion, 95%.
[26:06.50]Well, come on.
[26:06.92]Fuck.
[26:33.09]Mega potion.
[26:33.74]Let's do it again.
[26:37.92]Ten.
[26:38.86]Good.
[26:41.42]We're set on that.
[26:43.34]Now we need...
[26:48.44]Go back here.
[26:54.53]Can I buy the other combo book?
[26:55.93]I thought I didn't have enough money.
[27:01.55]Book of combos, too.
[27:02.49]I guess I did have enough.
[27:04.13]I have enough for all of them, but I'll get this one.
[27:07.03]Stick it in there.
[27:14.87]Try some of the new unknown combos.
[27:19.50]See what we can do.
[27:27.76]Combo list.
[27:29.78]Cactus flower and a bitter bug makes herbal medicine.
[27:38.21]Interesting.
[27:41.21]Catalyst.
[27:42.67]We got a new one.
[27:43.31]Catalyst and adamant seed is armor skin.
[27:51.28]Cool.
[27:53.61]Raw meat and toadstool.
[27:54.95]Hopefully this is cool.
[27:56.99]Poisoned meat.
[28:00.57]Makes for great bait on traps.
[28:06.15]Huh.
[28:10.92]What is a paintball?
[28:15.88]Iron ore and a bone.
[28:16.94]Hey, look at that iron pickaxe.
[28:21.93]Although I'd rather just buy them.
[28:27.13]Any others that I have never done?
[28:28.80]Ooh, two.
[28:30.88]What's this?
[28:31.32]Bone Husk S and Toadstool.
[28:32.86]I have a lot of Bone Husk S. Poison S. It's ammo.
[28:37.54]Gross.
[28:37.96]Don't want it.
[28:41.03]What about this one?
[28:43.11]Armor S. Ammo.
[28:44.35]Who cares?
[28:50.68]Tranquilizer and bone husk is.
[28:53.34]Trank shot.
[28:53.92]Yeah.
[28:58.10]That's it.
[29:05.67]Trap meat is hard to use because the monster will only do it if you're not in the area.
[29:09.88]I'm going to sell some shit.
[29:13.24]Let me sell some of the garbage that I have.
[29:17.07]What do I have that's just trash?
[29:20.15]How do you know if it's trash, though?
[29:21.77]That's the worst part.
[29:23.17]I have no idea what is trash and what's not trash.
[29:25.67]I have to just kind of go through and see what it says.
[29:33.31]Boomerang.
[29:34.01]Hmm.
[29:44.75]Okay, broken shell.
[29:46.51]Broken shell?
[29:47.27]Worthless?
[29:54.73]Where's my World of Warcraft gray text?
[30:00.70]Seriously.
[30:01.22]I'm still playing this?
[30:10.38]Yeah, I'm still playing.
[30:11.88]I gotta learn.
[30:13.14]I gotta know what to do.
[30:15.63]Sushi fish?
[30:16.43]Delete.
[30:21.03]The insect husks are useless.
[30:22.43]Okay.
[30:24.09]No, I'm not going to sell any monster parts.
[30:25.31]That would be fairly stupid, I guess.
[30:27.24]I don't know.
[30:27.54]Who cares?
[30:27.78]Let's just do it.
[30:32.26]I need pickaxes and bug nets.
[30:34.44]And then we're going to do some more boring stuff.
[30:43.75]It me.
[30:44.15]Hi, Kim.
[30:46.98]Hope you had a good day today.
[30:58.44]Pickaxe.
[30:59.58]I should take... No, the number one thing is I need the ore, and that'll be fine.
[31:14.38]Go over to his house so the stream gets interesting.
[31:18.18]Well, you don't like a guy in the menus for, like, fucking two hours?
[31:21.06]Come on.
[31:21.78]You don't want a guy in the menus and fighting a boss every, like, hour?
[31:28.46]I can't.
[31:29.01]I have a life.
[31:31.19]Oh, wow.
[31:32.79]That was pretty mean.
[31:40.75]Roasted and toasted.
[31:42.61]Hmm.
[31:51.18]Still haven't set any of these.
[31:52.34]What do I need to do?
[31:53.16]Upgrade.
[31:58.27]Yeah, we just need to mine.
[32:00.03]Alright, I'm going to the sand area.
[32:06.57]They're called monsters, not bosses.
[32:09.34]Whatever.
[32:09.66]Let me get my potions out and we can go and do some stuff.
[32:24.25]I don't think I'll need more than... I'm just taking one.
[32:27.41]No, I'm not gonna... What if I run into another Barath?
[32:29.86]Take them all.
[32:40.84]Talk to Cha-Cha.
[32:41.48]What does Cha-Cha have to say?
[32:42.54]Hey, Cha-Cha.
[32:43.70]What is it?
[32:43.96]What is it?
[32:50.74]No, you had one piece of honey.
[32:53.23]Good job.
[32:55.58]Select dances?
[32:58.22]I mean, select abilities.
[33:01.68]Alright, Cha-Cha.
[33:02.30]That's enough out of you.
[33:02.94]Let's go.
[33:13.36]Get a positive affinity weapon.
[33:15.68]Let's just take a quest in the sandy area.
[33:17.16]Can I get a gathering quest?
[33:20.28]That'd be nice, right?
[33:24.62]Pest control...
[33:27.02]Deadliest kid.
[33:27.52]These are just ludroths.
[33:28.62]Another royal ludroth.
[33:34.80]Trap.
[33:35.64]Survive until the time expires.
[33:37.94]Egg hunt.
[33:46.30]Seven ludroth?
[33:46.96]Like, who cares, right?
[33:47.74]Doesn't matter.
[33:48.16]That was in the forest, though.
[33:53.00]Forest.
[33:54.32]D-island.
[33:56.95]Plains.
[33:57.60]Deliver two herbivore eggs.
[34:01.58]Just get it and run around and do it.
[34:09.07]Do another water level?
[34:10.01]No way.
[34:12.35]Just gonna take it.
[34:15.47]Bring the pickaxe.
[34:16.74]I already have it in my... There we go.
[34:18.74]Five.
[34:21.75]Let's go get some ore and kill some rhinos and pick up random shit.
[34:26.13]No egg quests?
[34:27.03]Don't do the egg quests?
[34:28.11]Why not?
[34:32.84]Do harvest ores?
[34:33.76]No.
[34:43.64]I'm gonna regret this.
[34:46.96]Why?
[34:48.16]Why is this so bad?
[34:53.23]Egg?
[34:53.61]Why is this going to be good?
[34:54.73]I don't get it.
[34:55.79]What's the deal here?
[34:56.95]Egg quests are the worst.
[35:07.44]Why are they... Alright, just tell me how to do it then.
[35:09.72]I'll just skip the whole thing then.
[35:11.66]While I kill rhinoceroses and take their stuff.
[35:25.83]He's done for.
[35:26.49]Ow.
[35:33.66]Get that pocket watch ready.
[35:35.70]Start the timer.
[35:36.48]Come on, give me the things I need, not the garbage I don't want.
[35:53.95]Ow.
[35:59.55]Area 7.
[36:03.32]That'll work.
[36:07.48]Monster bones.
[36:09.06]Monster bone M. That's what I need.
[36:11.36]Let me get it.
[36:12.06]Ah.
[36:17.33]Area 7.
[36:17.87]Well, we'll just go down and then down.
[36:21.81]Get excited for another 40 minute hunt.
[36:25.49]Hey, thanks Magpie for the 200 bits.
[36:27.79]24-hour egg quest, PogChamp.
[36:30.25]Does this really suck that bad?
[36:34.35]How can this be that bad?
[36:35.41]You just have to pick up a couple of eggs.
[36:43.82]What's the big deal?
[36:48.82]Are they just hanging out on the edges or what?
[36:56.13]Let me see.
[36:58.23]Deliver two herbivore eggs.
[37:03.87]Just a boring search and find.
[37:10.70]What a bunch of egg haters.
[37:23.14]Yeah.
[37:25.65]Herb.
[37:30.47]She doesn't know?
[37:31.45]It's by the tree.
[37:32.47]I don't understand.
[37:33.73]Oh, I got one!
[37:39.74]Oh, no.
[37:47.76]Now I understand.
[37:48.82]Now I get it.
[37:52.06]Now I get it.
[37:54.02]How many do I need?
[37:54.68]Two or three?
[37:58.32]This sucks.
[38:02.67]Can these guys steal the egg?
[38:04.91]You better not be able to take the egg from me.
[38:08.33]Get away from me.
[38:13.41]This is so stupid.
[38:16.21]I definitely don't want to be doing this.
[38:22.23]Can I drop it and pick it up after I fight these things?
[38:27.09]Don't get hit.
[38:33.96]Hey, easy.
[38:34.48]Didn't even get hit.
[38:40.94]Herbivore egg delivered.
[38:41.82]I only need two of those.
[38:47.32]That's the good thing.
[38:51.76]This sucks.
[38:59.25]Let me line up better.
[39:04.95]Don't get hit and don't run out of stamina.
[39:08.62]Definitely noting that.
[39:14.26]I need those bones.
[39:15.16]Those are not... Watch out.
[39:17.76]No, he's going to go for Cha-Cha.
[39:21.98]Come on.
[39:24.84]Have I even gotten one M-Bone from these guys?
[39:27.40]I don't think I have.
[39:32.47]No M-Bone yet.
[39:34.67]Don't roll.
[39:36.93]Yeah, you'll break the egg.
[39:38.20]I know that.
[39:41.14]Monster bone M. Perfect.
[39:43.16]Give me four more of those.
[39:53.69]Will it just be in the same spawn?
[40:00.69]Nobody tell him.
[40:01.41]Nobody tell him what?
[40:09.91]Oh, that's true.
[40:10.93]I have never had sushi.
[40:13.03]I've never had, like, real sushi before.
[40:16.81]I've had... Well, I've eaten sushi before, but never, like, raw fish sushi before.
[40:22.99]Had it last night.
[40:25.53]It was interesting.
[40:28.15]Uncultured... Uncar... I can't even say that word.
[40:30.83]Uncar... I can't say that word.
[40:34.13]Uncar...
[40:37.32]Is something wrong with me right now?
[40:38.90]Uncultured.
[40:42.37]Uncultured.
[40:45.35]My tongue was getting stuck in the top of my mouth.
[40:50.11]I guess that this is hard.
[40:50.91]This is just tedious.
[40:57.92]Oh, shit.
[40:58.76]I need to mine.
[41:16.49]I just wanted to place it on the ground.
[41:20.39]Because I wanted to mine before finishing the quest.
[41:24.12]Okay.
[41:28.20]That was fucking dumb.
[41:34.92]Look at all the mines here.
[41:37.69]I haven't seen one.
[41:45.02]Fried eggs, that's right.
[41:50.40]I kind of hope I run into another one of those bosses.
[41:53.94]I feel like I could take them very easily now.
[42:05.47]Perfect.
[42:06.91]Alright, I need Malachite.
[42:14.53]Ice Crystal.
[42:15.29]People were talking about those earlier.
[42:16.35]Weren't you guys saying it was hard to find those?
[42:27.30]Nitro Shroom.
[42:29.56]What is the point of this game?
[42:31.20]It's to hunt monsters and pick up shit that's on the ground.
[42:48.46]It's a lot of shit here.
[42:53.24]What other things here?
[42:55.24]Nothing.
[42:58.02]Nothing at all.
[43:04.48]Yeah, we'll go slay.
[43:05.80]We'll go attack.
[43:06.46]Once I upgrade this weapon one more time, we'll go fight the next monster.
[43:15.29]But we have to do the boring bit first.
[43:18.58]Unfortunately.
[43:20.02]Sorry to say.
[43:23.12]We must do the boring shit.
[43:24.44]That looks like a vein.
[43:25.54]I can't touch that.
[43:27.52]A lot of them over here.
[43:45.53]These cats make the fucking weirdest noises.
[43:48.55]I could go take a whetstone.
[43:49.59]I don't even care.
[43:51.53]Let me be.
[43:56.90]The whole entire game is the boring bit.
[44:03.26]We all get opinions.
[44:16.08]I don't even want ice crystals.
[44:20.94]Earth crystal.
[44:22.02]Give me the Malachite.
[44:22.84]Okay.
[44:29.05]Well, that sucks.
[44:30.73]We'll go from 7 to 11.
[44:31.95]The whole game is boring if you're bad.
[44:43.68]I think this is just one of those games that takes a long time to do anything.
[44:51.71]In a game where boss fights are designed at their core to last more than 15 minutes, that's not a game for everybody.
[45:03.95]I'm enjoying it, though.
[45:04.51]I'm having fun.
[45:08.70]I wouldn't be playing it if I wasn't having fun.
[45:15.28]Mine the blue?
[45:16.18]Where's their blue?
[45:24.34]I want my shit back.
[45:29.72]Can't get it here?
[45:30.42]Really?
[45:33.82]It's a shock trap.
[45:34.59]Holy shit.
[45:39.23]Secret stash?
[45:42.29]Oh, the cats dropped this, right?
[45:50.05]It's more common later.
[45:54.61]Well, we're just going to have to... I have to find it.
[45:56.33]I feel like there was a lot of it in the forest level.
[46:08.33]Let's see if I can run into something this way.
[46:21.57]I feel like there's going to be a monster in here.
[46:32.20]Crystal bone.
[46:33.06]I'm just going to go back to the woods.
[46:39.88]I live in a multi-million dollar mansion?
[46:41.75]No, I don't.
[46:45.93]Just going to get the egg.
[46:46.65]Yeah, I'll go.
[46:47.47]Let's get out of here.
[46:48.99]I picked up a little...
[46:52.00]Decent amount.
[46:52.52]I'll get this too.
[46:55.97]The mic desynced again.
[47:22.09]Streaming?
[47:22.49]When am I going to play with people?
[47:24.80]I say I'm going to go for one more large kill.
[47:28.64]And then I'll hop online.
[47:31.42]Let's see what we do.
[47:33.98]Alright, let's just pick up an egg and run.
[47:44.61]Can't carry any more items.
[47:47.79]Does that mean I can't carry an egg?
[47:49.09]Okay.
[47:53.93]Come on.
[47:54.65]Really?
[47:54.93]Well, I need to just delete something then.
[48:02.14]Stone, herb, raw meat.
[48:04.56]Just eat the raw meat.
[48:08.61]What?
[48:09.73]Oh, I put it on the ground.
[48:13.49]Good.
[48:13.65]I gave this guy a little snack.
[48:14.71]That's good.
[48:23.35]Watch how the pros do it.
[48:25.13]I'm interested to see.
[48:25.92]Don't get hit.
[48:34.80]I wonder if people still are actually online.
[48:44.41]That's a herbivore.
[48:45.29]Alright, we can get out of here.
[48:50.23]This one's done.
[48:51.33]Although I would like to...
[48:53.67]No.
[48:54.59]Screw it.
[48:58.79]What the fuck just happened?
[49:00.99]What happened?
[49:01.45]What the fuck was that?
[49:02.39]What happened to the egg?
[49:03.85]Why did the egg break?
[49:05.13]What the fuck just happened?
[49:12.00]I was there.
[49:13.04]I was so close.
[49:14.32]I was there.
[49:14.94]I was there.
[49:23.97]Well... God damn it.
[49:26.61]At least I can get some monster bones.
[49:30.01]If I run out of stamina, I just drop the egg.
[49:39.70]It's alright.
[49:40.54]Who cares?
[49:44.80]Well, if that happened, I wouldn't have gotten these, and I need these bad, so... Hopefully I have enough.
[49:52.04]Fuck, I do have to do this again.
[50:01.70]Egg quests in a nutshell.
[50:06.93]Dust off your Wii U. Do it.
[50:08.65]Why not?
[50:10.35]I don't care about ping.
[50:11.37]You think I give a shit about ping in this game?
[50:15.09]I'd rather just jump in like a random group of shit little people and just see what people do.
[50:18.80]See how fun it is.
[50:22.18]Hold on.
[50:23.92]You can hear like my house burning down back here.
[50:25.68]Give me a second.
[50:34.15]My furnace is right here.
[50:36.25]Sorry about that.
[50:39.75]Well, let's make sure that doesn't happen again.
[50:40.85]What do I have?
[50:46.81]What can I just drop?
[50:47.73]Just drop something on the ground.
[50:48.93]Who cares what it is?
[50:50.05]Unknown skull?
[50:50.91]No.
[50:55.21]Don't I have just like a rock?
[50:56.03]Let's drop the stones.
[51:06.88]Let's go.
[51:12.52]Now he's learning.
[51:17.87]Yeah, furnace.
[51:21.73]Where I stream from is down... I have a room that's built in my basement.
[51:27.92]There's a finished basement here.
[51:35.16]And my office is right next to the furnace, but I have a great room because you can't hear it now.
[51:45.83]If the Switch gets a Monster Hunter and you stream it, I'll play that.
[51:48.39]I mean, at this point, yes.
[51:54.07]This series has me interested enough to... Like, I would play it on the Switch because it's going to be like a next-gen version of it.
[52:08.18]I thought I lived in a trailer.
[52:09.30]No, I don't live in a trailer.
[52:14.71]A trailer.
[52:24.97]I'm in for Monster Hunter 5.
[52:25.95]Why not?
[52:29.09]Yeah, sure.
[52:29.81]Okay.
[52:38.68]Okay, let's go get the ore from the forest.
[52:46.90]The one bit about Monster Hunter is there's this stuff.
[52:51.44]I want to upgrade this weapon.
[52:53.81]So I have to do all the boring shit before upgrading the weapon.
[52:59.19]So I have enough Monster Bone M's.
[53:01.25]I have enough Barath Shell.
[53:03.67]I just need some Malachite.
[53:07.90]five of them to be exact let's go get it welcome to the welcome to the this is you know here's another reason this is why I wanted to do a long stream on this game because it takes a while to have anything kind of happen so why not right can't do anything with that no hunt report fine
[53:37.65]Flooded forest.
[53:51.81]Starting to run out of space.
[53:54.67]It's getting very overwhelming how much stuff I have right now.
[53:57.65]I don't know.
[53:59.17]It's kind of... I don't even know what to say.
[54:04.31]So much stuff.
[54:06.21]How was fighting the Barath?
[54:07.27]I beat the Barath in the first try.
[54:12.80]First try at Barath, it wasn't that hard.
[54:18.66]You will choose listening to me over podcasts and music.
[54:21.43]Well, that's very kind of you, dude.
[54:22.51]Thank you.
[54:29.81]So, should I just go here?
[54:31.41]No, that's the woods.
[54:32.29]Flooded Forest.
[54:35.30]So what dumb quest am I going to get for Flooded Forest?
[54:43.60]The island... Flooded Forest, Great Wargi.

[55:16.01]You know what?
[55:16.35]I'm curious.
[55:16.91]You guys are talking about that.
[55:20.45]Where is the harvest tour like a quest?
[55:23.49]I need to know what the hell I'm doing here.
[55:29.93]I'm definitely going to play Neo for sure.
[55:41.09]How do I cancel this shit?
[55:44.13]There we go.
[55:47.52]Okay.
[55:54.48]I've got some glory.
[55:58.53]Harvest tour is literally dick around for an hour.

[57:01.75]Let's do it.
[57:02.03]Let me just get my potions.
[57:06.27]He's just a stupid, dumb, big bear.
[57:07.53]Well, I feel like I've been walking around aimlessly for like 45 minutes, so let's put some action into this, alright?
[57:22.48]Okay, what happened to my potions?

[58:51.13]I don't know.
[58:55.57]I'll kill this guy easily.
[58:57.13]Don't worry about me.
[58:58.59]Bear's gone down.

[59:17.60]But where?
[59:18.92]I'm going to say he's in 8.
[59:20.12]Take a wild guess and say he's in 8.
[59:33.74]Mmm, three.
[59:38.14]I could go into 12, too, and maybe the Malachite is there.
[59:45.03]Oh, get hype.
[59:46.41]Yeah.
[59:47.55]I'm so hyped up right now, I can't believe it.
[59:49.55]I can hardly contain myself.
[59:59.06]Keep your eyes peeled.
[59:59.84]There we go.
[60:03.68]He's not in eight.
[60:04.82]Well, whatever.
[60:10.40]Stone.
[60:12.66]Stone.
[60:16.18]A lot of shit.
[60:17.45]Okay, what about six?
[60:24.35]No.
[60:27.57]Just a couple of jaggies.
[60:38.44]Get... Get out of here.
[60:42.02]Oh, my God.
[60:48.43]Chacha, you could have brought him somewhere else completely away from this.
[60:52.63]In fact, just keep dancing around.
[60:53.89]It's helping.
[61:01.30]Do something, please, Chacha.
[61:04.78]Whatever, let's go.
[61:13.38]He's not here.
[61:17.44]Where the hell is this guy then?
[61:18.74]He's not underwater.
[61:20.04]Why would the bear be underwater?
[61:20.98]Is he in one?
[61:26.14]Whoa!
[61:26.84]Whoa, that's him.
[61:27.96]Has to be him.
[61:28.96]Oh, wow, this guy's really easy.
[61:30.94]Why was I so scared?
[61:33.88]I've already fought this thing.
[61:38.76]I am not afraid at all.
[61:39.98]This is not even a boss.
[61:41.85]He's like a random dumb enemy.
[61:50.21]I've already seen this.
[61:52.11]Watch it.
[62:21.04]And he gets his ass beat.
[62:23.12]No, I didn't.
[62:24.76]I'm just trying to be fast.
[62:34.32]Ah, don't run away from me like that.
[62:35.50]Actually, he's kind of kicking my ass.
[62:45.97]Well, there he goes.
[62:51.46]Um... He can just go to sleep.
[62:54.84]I don't give a shit.
[62:55.52]I want to mine.
[62:55.94]Let's go up to 12.
[63:08.07]I don't want the quest to end.
[63:08.83]I want to go up to 12 to be able to mine.
[63:18.16]All the way to the back of 12, this should be Malachite, right?
[63:25.30]No mercy.
[63:25.98]That's the fastest way to get there.
[63:41.65]This ain't even a challenge.
[63:43.71]No, it's not.
[63:47.47]All this is, is just to prepare to fight the next actual boss.
[64:00.70]12.
[64:01.88]And there we go.
[64:03.66]Why am I not using paintballs?
[64:04.64]Because that boss is so easy that I just don't even care.
[64:08.08]I'll find him.
[64:14.29]Hey, thank you, Shoeshine, for the 10 bucks.
[64:17.13]They say, I love you, Jerma.
[64:18.49]Well, thank you, Shoeshine.
[64:19.61]That's extremely kind of you.
[64:24.63]I have fought the Kuropeko.
[64:25.59]I have beat Kuropeko.
[64:26.55]And Baroth is the last boss that I fought.
[64:31.63]Barov.
[64:35.49]There's an interesting looking one.
[64:37.98]Thought that was going to kill him.
[64:45.86]No, it did kill him.
[64:55.18]Okay.
[65:04.08]Is Great Jagi gonna be in the next Rumble?
[65:08.70]Yes.
[65:09.96]Absolutely.
[65:11.66]Abso-fucking-lutely.
[65:13.50]If we do another stream, Rumble, absolutely.
[65:16.74]The Great Jagi is gonna be in it.
[65:19.27]No doubt.
[65:28.45]He's mining it too.
[65:32.55]There we go.
[65:32.81]There's one.
[65:33.85]Come on.
[65:34.23]I need more than that.
[65:35.43]Two.
[65:35.85]Nice.
[65:36.09]Come on.
[65:36.57]Give me another one.
[65:38.09]Come on.
[65:38.71]Give me another one.
[65:39.59]Give me a big, juicy vein here.
[65:43.41]Come on.
[65:44.03]Oh, come on.
[65:47.37]Do it.
[65:49.25]Oh, shit.
[65:51.94]I only got two.
[65:58.80]Nice try.
[66:04.12]I need five, yeah.
[66:05.06]I have two or three.
[66:05.80]Let's go kill the bear.
[66:21.09]Didn't miss one, did I?
[66:22.19]No.
[66:27.19]Check area four.
[66:28.12]I will.
[66:29.94]I'm running out of pickaxes, though.
[66:30.98]I'm going to have to postpone this.
[66:36.89]It's the fastest way to get there.
[66:38.09]Hop on 8.
[66:42.56]Yeah, 8 and then go to 8 to 5.
[66:45.68]Look around for the bear.
[66:56.08]Did I fight Royal Ludroth?
[66:57.22]I have.
[66:57.66]And it was a fucking unbearable experience.
[67:06.84]I beat him first try, but he was extremely annoying.
[67:22.03]No.
[67:24.01]Gone five.
[67:24.65]We can check four and kill the bear, hopefully, in the same time frame.
[67:37.53]This used to be a jaggy stream.
[67:40.45]You know, you're right.
[67:41.97]It did used to be a jaggy stream.
[67:44.98]So we'll go wrap around to four.
[67:47.04]Three, one, two, and hopefully we see the bear.
[67:50.12]There he is.
[67:51.74]Bucket, let's just kill him.
[67:57.87]Just kill him.
[68:11.79]I'll be dead soon.
[68:27.49]He's dead.
[68:29.86]See you later bear.
[68:32.16]I wonder if in the 60 seconds that I have that I can just sprint to four right now after I skin him.
[68:41.88]How do I upgrade the gauge?
[68:44.18]I think I have to land the last hit in the combo, right?
[68:49.76]That's it.
[68:50.28]Alright, quickly.
[68:51.58]Over to four.
[68:54.46]Well, there's still a second.
[68:56.65]Go, go, go, go.
[69:01.23]Oop.
[69:05.77]Come on.
[69:08.77]You fucker, let's go.
[69:09.81]That's a pain in the ass.
[69:16.56]What a pain in the ass.
[69:23.06]Dude, I will be so happy if this little asshole, if he picked up like two of them.
[69:37.86]You gotta land the last hit.
[69:38.90]Yeah.
[69:45.67]Alright, please tell me you got one or two.
[69:51.59]Little buddy of mine.
[70:01.33]Cha-cha.
[70:11.14]Dammit.
[70:11.93]He didn't have any.
[70:15.77]Alright, let's go do the harvest quest.
[70:38.34]a lot of iron hey sprocket thank you for the nine months welcome back thank you for your continued nine months alright we can either do sunken treasure or harvest let's see sunken treasures
[71:06.40]Or the three star harvester.
[71:08.16]Let's do it.
[71:16.01]Three star harvester.
[71:20.31]Whoa!
[71:21.15]Almost didn't buy pickaxes.
[71:24.79]That would have been a mistake.
[71:26.49]That would have been a huge mistake.
[71:46.27]I don't think I've ever done one of these.
[71:54.19]You just kind of go around and mine shit?
[71:55.97]That's all you do?
[71:59.11]What's the actual quest?
[72:02.69]Survive until time expires or deliver a paw pass ticket.
[72:08.11]Paw pass ticket.
[72:19.12]I'm not going to be here for 50 minutes, am I?
[72:20.74]I don't want to be here for 50 minutes.
[72:33.43]Tickets spawn after 5 minutes.
[72:34.69]Well, thank god.
[72:44.02]You dick.
[72:45.70]You dick.
[72:47.32]Get out of here.
[72:49.73]I'm trying to do my mystery tour.
[72:58.16]Please.
[72:59.40]Please clap.
[73:08.44]Please clap.
[73:18.66]Gonna play Fistful of Frags anytime soon?
[73:20.20]Maybe.
[73:20.44]If I get into it.
[73:26.26]Can you donate using Venmo?
[73:29.40]No, I don't take... I don't accept third-party donations.
[73:37.87]That guy's a little bit bigger.
[73:47.19]Supplies delivered.
[73:50.31]Okay.
[73:50.43]Let's get some bugs too.
[73:57.78]Visceral frags has gotten boring.
[74:06.21]Please clap.
[74:09.17]Please clap.
[74:16.08]Doesn't want your dirty third... Well, I don't take PayPal, Venmo.
[74:18.88]I don't do donations like that.
[74:22.22]I can tell you why.
[74:24.37]Go off on a tangent as to why, but... Some of you guys probably already know.
[74:31.83]It's a lot to do with, like, chargebacks and... Hold on a second.
[74:40.22]No, I don't want... I want to trade with you, but I keep trying to skip your, like, five boxes of dialog that I don't care about.
[74:47.34]Oh my god.
[74:47.80]Fuck, can I kick this guy off the fucking cliff?
[74:51.57]I would love... I would love nothing more than to boot this Yoda fucking look-alike asshole off the edge.
[75:04.83]I'm gonna take my anger out on you, Cha-Cha!
[75:08.56]You're just as small as he is.
[75:15.88]Whatever Let's go up to eight.
[75:26.07]RIP ChaCha Stop kicking ChaCha you monster.
[75:34.24]Hey, well this is Monster Hunter.
[75:36.74]I am a monster in this game.
[75:46.03]Underwater mining?
[75:48.72]Is there veins down here?
[75:52.24]I was trying to warn ChaCha that I was trying to kick the Yoda.
[75:55.38]He just kept getting in the way.
[76:06.61]What's the best place for these things to spawn?
[76:12.11]Is there a certain area where they're more than they are?
[76:14.41]I'm only seeing like one.
[76:18.78]Alright, we're going up this way.
[76:24.99]Vayne's on six and five.
[76:26.17]Okay.
[76:27.01]We're supposed to go there, though.
[76:32.83]If you want to find me, I'm in ten, huh?
[76:36.17]What?
[76:37.20]What?
[76:39.10]Hey, Ross Camp, thanks for the four months, dude.
[76:48.23]Wasn't I already in six and five?
[76:52.97]Ooh, I already see at least a couple of them.
[77:03.40]I just need two.
[77:07.40]I feel like this is going to take a little longer than I anticipated upgrading this katana again.
[77:26.84]There we go.
[77:32.89]Finally.
[77:34.07]Let's peruse around and make sure I didn't miss one.
[77:41.70]Don't think I did.
[77:44.78]No, there it is.
[77:45.33]There's one.
[77:54.04]I need a lot of that, don't I?
[77:55.53]That, like, Pegasaurus light.
[77:58.81]That's it for here.
[78:11.07]Continue on down the mystery highway.
[78:15.79]Please clap.
[78:23.36]And that's why, when I pick up the ore, I expect my family to be there.
[78:29.85]Please clap.
[78:36.21]Who said that?
[78:36.87]Who said that?
[78:37.35]Was it you?
[78:41.35]Oh, dude!
[78:41.91]Two Malachite ore!
[78:43.03]Please clap for that one, please.
[78:44.51]Oh, three in a row!
[78:47.03]Damn!
[78:48.72]Now I'm fucking ready to go.
[78:51.18]Boys and girls.
[78:55.15]Please clap.
[79:01.09]Haha.
[79:02.67]Haha.
[79:06.02]You know, I didn't know what the haha emote even was until like four days ago.
[79:11.06]Alright, let me turn my paw print in, right?
[79:25.54]I thought it was people just saying, like, haha, well, that was funny.
[79:29.72]Because I don't have better twitch.tv.
[79:31.18]So anytime I see, I look over and I see haha, I'm like, oh, somebody thought I was funny.
[79:34.99]Nope.
[79:37.53]Nope, it just means, like, I fucking don't, like, fuck you.
[79:40.59]Isn't that what it means?
[79:45.77]Doesn't it mean, like, oh, haha, yeah, you're not funny.
[79:50.65]It's something like that.
[79:51.85]And I just thought people were laughing at my jokes.
[79:53.79]Hahaha.
[79:57.28]I thought people thought I was really funny.
[80:03.40]Where am I going right now?
[80:04.76]With my paw print?
[80:06.04]How do I put my paw print in?
[80:09.36]Nobody thinks you're funny.
[80:21.05]Well, take it easy, Shoe Shine.
[80:21.97]Thanks for hanging out.
[80:23.71]How long am I going to play this tonight?
[80:25.15]Probably for another couple hours?
[80:27.84]I wanna get at least one more big, like, boss done.
[80:38.53]It's supposed to be like an awkward laugh.
[80:40.33]Oh.
[80:46.81]Let's go upgrade my katana and let's fight a big boss.
[80:59.72]Can't wait till I fight the gen.
[81:05.51]Blue box or what?
[81:08.39]Paw pass ticket.
[81:10.01]Alright, I'll get the hell out of here.
[81:22.80]Am I ready for the next one?
[81:23.90]What's the next major boss?
[81:25.72]After I upgrade that I will be able to take on.
[81:29.23]Hey, Zima Zhang, thanks for the nine months.
[81:31.71]Wager, thanks for nine months.
[81:34.90]Welcome back, guys.
[81:40.38]To the urgent quest?
[81:41.08]Okay.
[81:44.68]Praise.
[81:45.28]Ooh.
[81:57.98]Claymore on the defense.
[81:59.78]Bomb boost.
[82:05.49]Send equipment.
[82:09.99]Send box.
[82:11.67]That one's rare.
[82:13.21]Don't know what any of that means, but okay.
[82:14.67]Can't be waiting, huh?
[82:20.85]Aw, thanks, Kim!
[82:21.89]I did it!
[82:22.65]I put the ticket into the other box.
[82:29.48]Little boss voice.
[82:31.76]Thanks, Skippy.
[82:33.74]One of our mods, Skippy Squeeze.
[82:38.14]You're pretty good.
[82:40.00]Thanks.
[82:40.46]Appreciate that, dude.
[82:44.32]Why am I so short?
[82:48.10]Because my legs aren't as long as yours.
[82:53.76]My torso is not as long as yours either.
[82:58.66]Hmm.
[83:02.00]I think that's how.
[83:04.62]Let's upgrade this thing.
[83:07.38]Cerberus Katana.
[83:08.14]Let's see what it looks like.
[83:09.38]Yeah, it looks kind of cool.
[83:10.86]It's got some teeth on it.
[83:14.15]Let's see.
[83:18.95]Let's do it.
[83:19.25]396. 396.
[83:23.27]Why am I so old?
[83:24.43]Because when a year goes by, every time a year goes, you know, you go from January to January, you age.
[83:34.03]And that's happened over 30 times.
[83:36.51]That's how I become old.
[83:43.41]Upgrade.
[83:44.13]Do it.
[83:44.69]Done.
[83:45.49]What's next?
[83:47.26]Now we're talking.
[83:49.52]Ananta Boneblade of Bleeding Cross.
[83:52.28]People were telling me to look for green.
[83:53.42]Well, the next stage is green.
[83:58.68]Both of these.
[84:01.45]What do they look like?
[84:03.77]Ooh.
[84:05.41]Okay.
[84:05.85]I want this one.
[84:07.29]How do I get this one?
[84:09.25]This one's like just a reskin of the one I have now, but this one... This one looks cool.
[84:20.69]Alright, nice.
[84:28.41]Okay.
[84:29.69]Let's go fight a boss.
[84:32.22]One's paralysis and one is poison.
[84:37.84]Let's just store some things, get my items that I need, and let's go fight a boss.
[84:43.66]Let's go play Monster Hunter instead of collecting items for an hour.
[84:49.81]Yeah, regardless of which one is better, the Bleeding Cross looks cooler, so I'm going to get that one.
[84:59.59]For sure.
[85:00.11]I'm going to assume I can't get it yet, though.
[85:05.66]That's probably in another ten hours or something of playing the game.
[85:08.22]Who cares about mega potions?
[85:11.34]I've got ten.
[85:12.86]Seventeen wet stones.
[85:16.84]I'm gonna eat.
[85:17.34]I think I'm alright.
[85:18.38]I'm good to go.
[85:18.82]Let's try and do something.
[85:23.14]Hey, hey.
[85:23.78]Are you gonna fight a box?
[85:31.53]Salty milk.
[85:32.39]Ugh.
[85:40.32]Someone please tell me there's a game similar to this on PC.
[85:43.74]I don't think so.
[85:44.54]I don't know.
[85:52.38]Just wait for the switch.
[85:53.28]And wait for them to make it to the switch.
[85:55.40]Or to get a DS.
[85:57.94]Alright, am I good with everything?
[86:02.77]Hot drink, cool drink, I don't even know.
[86:04.87]Let's just... Whatever.
[86:08.33]I mean, Dark Souls, yeah.
[86:09.69]But Dark Souls is... A much different game.
[86:13.54]It's very different.
[86:16.08]Hunt a gobble!
[86:18.78]We're going gobble hunting.
[86:23.01]Let's try it.
[86:27.83]God Eater is similar?
[86:28.67]I've never played it.
[86:29.91]Whitestone, Mega Potion.
[86:30.97]That'll be good.
[86:33.85]Let's do it.
[86:37.19]What's the food do?
[86:37.97]When you eat the food, you get a buff for whatever quest you're about to do.
[86:44.27]Let's go, Gobble.
[86:46.79]Another underwater fight.
[86:48.11]Aha, can't wait.
[86:48.85]It's gonna be fucking great.
[86:57.38]Can't wait.
[87:05.66]Who's going to take this stuff?
[87:07.10]Take the oxygen supply.
[87:08.20]Probably shouldn't have picked up the whetstone, but who cares?
[87:11.83]Alright.
[87:14.15]Let's go hunting.
[87:18.77]Please clap.
[87:22.97]If it's an underwater boss, I'm assuming it's... Oh, God, I...
[87:27.20]I already can tell I'm not going to have any fun.
[87:28.82]I can already smell it.
[87:34.64]It's almost only underwater.
[87:41.46]Okay.
[87:44.72]Not in three.
[87:45.52]Let's try four.
[87:46.88]You're going to bed?
[87:48.82]Well, have a good night, Smokey.
[87:50.20]Thanks for hanging out.
[88:05.48]four no five six well I'm looking at chat and I see somebody in all capitals writing I hated this boss so much so I hope you guys are ready to hear me complain on stream apparently nobody liked the underwater fight so they got rid of them from Monster Hunter 4.
[88:27.93]I could see that, because every underwater encounter I've had in this game has been like, tear my hair out, I hate it.
[88:32.97]Like, please uninstall the game type of anger.
[88:36.16]Like, it's just not fun to be underwater.
[88:43.70]Fuck this boss, fuck this boss.
[88:45.00]Really?
[88:45.40]Goddamn.
[88:50.00]Six?
[88:50.71]He's in six.
[88:55.95]Let's see what the gobble is.
[88:59.74]What do you mean I need a frog?
[89:00.66]What are you talking about?
[89:04.89]Oh, it's just a Yogg-Saron.
[89:13.97]This is going to suck.
[89:14.75]I can already tell.
[89:15.41]Alright, here we go.
[89:17.31]Let's fight him.
[89:27.55]Where is he?
[89:29.62]He's little.
[89:30.30]He's a little guy.
[89:31.22]He's not even that big.
[89:35.64]He's the moving blob.
[89:44.78]Okay.
[89:45.84]Do not stand.
[89:47.66]Do not stand in that spot.
[89:54.24]Can I not string together combos down here?
[89:58.61]Can't.
[89:59.39]That sucks.
[90:01.77]That's not cool.
[90:11.39]And he's got a flash.
[90:14.19]Come on, jump up.
[90:33.40]I mean, one has to imagine it.
[90:34.50]I can, like, smash the lightbulb, right?
[90:36.02]I'm gonna go for the lightbulb.
[90:43.92]God, I wish these fucking dickheads would get the fuck out of the way.
[90:51.92]I hit it.
[91:02.11]I guess I can do that combo down here.
[91:06.53]Nope, let's do it.
[91:07.15]Activate the fucking VAT system.
[91:10.52]What?
[91:11.88]What's going on?
[91:13.26]What is happening to my character?
[91:14.44]What am I doing?
[91:16.44]Did I like electrocute myself?
[91:19.02]Because I activated the VAT system?
[91:22.77]What the fuck is going on?
[91:25.61]I'm so confused.
[91:29.25]I hit R, and I got electrocuted.
[91:32.54]Was that him that did that, or did I do that to myself?
[91:38.32]I have no fucking idea.
[91:42.20]I think I heard him.
[91:47.83]Get out of the fucking way.
[92:04.02]Did I get him?
[92:11.62]I got him.
[92:12.52]Wow, easy here.
[92:15.26]Stick over there, please.
[92:28.57]Hmm.
[92:36.36]Is he in the dirt again?
[92:37.26]Yeah, there he is.
[92:38.98]Yeah, there are no health bars.
[92:48.71]I really don't like the fact that I can't do my 2x combo.
[92:52.33]It's sort of annoying, but whatever.
[92:56.05]I feel like I'm much slower underwater with this thing, too.
[93:08.87]Watch the oxygen.
[93:09.61]Yeah, I'm keeping my eye on it.
[93:10.49]It's the first time I've seen it block like that.
[93:18.17]Here he goes.
[93:21.30]I think I paintballed him.
[93:22.16]Although it doesn't really matter, does it?
[93:29.58]No rewind.
[93:32.26]What am I going to rewind to?
[93:43.10]I really want to try to break it, but... Is it really worth it?
[93:58.75]Dude, not only am I glad that they removed the underwater shit from Monster Hunter 4, I hope they fucking fired the guy that made all these levels.
[94:08.18]I hope they gave him a fucking cardboard box with all of his shit in it.
[94:10.84]And they were just like, Frank, you know, Chuck, Jesus Christ, man, those water levels were fucking terrible.
[94:17.09]We gotta let you go.
[94:20.01]He's like, no, but, come on, it's intuitive.
[94:23.23]You fucking, you're underwater and it's fucking sloppy and it sucks.
[94:26.85]Frank, Frank, calm down.
[94:29.03]Look, maybe at some point you can make a Mario 64 underwater level for Nintendo.
[94:33.45]I know they're looking for a new underwater guy.
[94:37.68]Are they?
[94:38.06]Nah.
[94:39.02]Get the fuck out of here.
[94:40.34]Just trying to make you... Alright, shut up.
[94:41.58]I gotta play.
[94:47.17]I'm gonna die down here because I'm complaining about how much I fucking hate this.
[95:05.79]That's kind of mean this this sucks it's true these areas are fucking terrible I was promised to know I'm not joking.
[95:25.66]I'm being for real fuck this This is just this is hearts to play
[95:42.70]It's really like the actual... After playing for a while, it's really the only complaint I think I have at this point.
[95:48.94]Is how much I fucking hate this.
[95:50.74]I guess we're... Ah, okay.
[95:58.99]Alright, game.
[95:59.51]Fucking god.
[96:03.41]Oh my god.
[96:05.07]Fucking god.
[96:26.45]Thank you.
[97:00.35]He's angry now.
[97:03.97]Fucking dammit.
[97:09.62]Who wants to play in water levels?
[97:14.49]Nobody does.
[97:20.24]You get, like, a focus group together of, like, a bunch of people that play video games.
[97:24.40]And you have them rate different areas of games.
[97:29.04]I would put fucking money that all of them would say water levels.
[97:32.64]I would.
[97:35.42]But people still continue to put them in games.
[97:46.26]Just give me a fucking speedboat and, like, be done with it.
[98:02.96]back it up back it up back it up back it up please alright come on I need to get a good combo
[98:31.64]Can drink potions underwater?
[98:50.13]Yeah, that doesn't make very much sense, does it?
[98:57.41]Where the hell did he just go?
[99:02.23]Having fun yet?
[99:04.82]What is he doing on the land?
[99:08.40]He can come out of the water?
[99:09.66]I thought he was a fish.
[99:12.02]I thought he was a fucking fish.
[99:15.46]I would have come out here a long time ago.
[99:27.59]And he's in.
[99:27.99]Whetstone.
[99:36.10]Don't screw this up, bug.
[99:37.24]Don't screw this up for me.
[99:39.46]Thank God he's a terrible player.
[99:40.96]He's terrible, yeah.
[99:42.18]Thank God that bug is a terrible player.
[99:43.62]You know, back in the water.
[99:54.17]The misery continues.
[100:02.47]I seriously don't know how that's happening.
[100:07.26]So when I go, when I scroll through, and I pick something, I was on first aid, and then why was I sharpening my sword?
[100:13.23]Huh?
[100:15.97]I don't get that.
[100:17.45]What's up with that?
[100:36.90]He's got to be getting close, right?
[100:38.34]Has to be.
[100:44.01]My only complaint.
[100:44.89]Yeah, there it is.
[100:45.41]My only complaint.
[100:57.30]Level it up.
[100:57.76]Get out of the way.
[101:09.14]Oh, thank God.
[101:11.69]I thought that was like there's an instant kill or something Flash
[101:33.47]I'm doing damage.
[101:36.83]He just needs to die.
[101:46.82]Listen to me, son!
[101:50.67]That's not good.
[101:53.77]I'm gonna heal.
[101:55.55]I need to really heal.
[101:58.80]Chacha, you need to really shine here, buddy.
[102:02.86]Thank you, Chacha.
[102:04.12]You're my best friend.
[102:25.44]No, don't.
[102:43.02]something about these underwater bosses fucking holy ludwig the holy blade whatever his name was he's just seriously just causing me fucking anxiety the whole time
[103:12.10]No, he dodged.
[103:18.10]Please stay up here and don't run away again.
[103:20.00]Trap it?
[103:27.62]I don't have any traps on me.
[103:29.06]Wait, what?
[103:44.08]No.
[103:44.36]There he goes again.
[103:46.72]He's limping.
[103:47.28]There he goes.
[104:03.09]There he is.
[104:08.07]There you go.
[104:12.62]Upgraded again.
[104:15.20]Keep it going.
[104:17.20]Keep it going.
[104:23.22]Can do it another time.
[104:24.14]Alright, let's do it.
[104:27.52]Activate the fucking vat.
[104:28.33]This'll kill him, right?
[104:30.35]Hopefully it'll kill him.
[104:33.29]Let's do the vat system one final time.
[104:40.47]Purple.
[104:43.14]We got a purple weapon now.
[104:44.68]A red weapon with a purple thing.
[104:48.70]Come on, die!
[104:49.74]Die!
[105:00.45]Shit.
[105:05.31]Where is he?
[105:12.13]Did he leave the area?
[105:20.55]I guess he's gone.
[105:21.79]Where the hell does he go to sleep?
[105:28.62]Alright.
[105:33.08]I lose my combo there.
[105:34.22]That sucks.
[105:44.00]Somebody just wrote in all capitals.
[105:46.62]Jeremy.
[105:50.10]Jeremy.
[105:51.77]Listen.
[105:55.13]Jeremy.
[105:57.77]That's like somebody... That's my mother talking to me.
[106:01.75]Jeremy.
[106:02.69]Listen.
[106:12.02]Over here?
[106:14.77]Use Sonic Bomb when it's under the ground.
[106:17.01]He's almost dead anyways.
[106:24.30]Sonic Bomb.
[106:27.88]Yep.
[106:29.36]Where are you?
[106:33.62]Ah, I see the bubbles.
[106:35.64]There you are.
[106:41.23]Fucking hate underwater.
[106:42.45]I hate this.
[106:46.77]I almost missed him again.
[106:49.69]Fuckin' my god.
[107:20.58]Can we get three land bosses before we have another water one?
[107:25.58]It's been water, land, water.
[107:30.22]Why are there so many of these right now?
[107:31.95]I don't get it.
[107:34.43]Are you throwing the shit part of the game at me early so I don't have to do this again?
[107:37.47]Or what?
[107:45.77]Frank.
[107:53.72]I'm not gonna get it off.
[107:56.10]Ooh, it's so hard for me not to wanna fucking just clench this weak brick.
[108:06.77]And smash it directly into my face.
[108:28.19]Whoa This is so painful This game is so good.
[108:35.60]It's so much fun, and there's so much to do Thank God they deleted this shit from the later game This would make like children cry
[108:50.04]I can imagine being like fucking 10 years old and playing this, and being like, I don't understand, mom.
[108:54.78]Mom, why is this game so not fun?
[108:58.20]I don't understand.
[109:00.27]And the mother will be like, oh, get good, right?
[109:02.21]That's what the mother would say.
[109:07.03]Oh, get good, son.
[109:07.95]God damn.
[109:11.15]I'm gonna fucking break.
[109:29.34]I hate the underwater portion of this game.
[109:31.67]To a point where this game would be like a 9 for me.
[109:34.21]It's a 5.
[109:35.67]Because of the underwater sections.
[109:57.91]Get away from me, please!
[110:00.01]Get me out of the water!
[110:01.03]5 out of 10, too much water.
[110:11.91]Why is he even playing 3?
[110:36.80]Yeah, this is the one that's on the Wii U and I don't have a way to capture my DS.
[110:49.69]I hate to say that and I hate to be like that, but like what did I just even do?
[110:54.23]What did I agree to with this guy?
[111:00.34]Rare trade.
[111:01.10]Whatever.
[111:10.51]But really, like, just annoying stuff like that just slides underneath my skin.
[111:17.39]Big time.
[111:29.48]Okay.
[111:34.47]Tundra.
[111:34.83]Are we going to the frozen area?
[111:39.52]No, we're at level four now.

[111:46.88]Okay.
[111:48.10]Hunt a Lagombe.
[111:51.46]Great Baggy.
[111:52.46]Ooh, a Great Baggy.
[111:57.04]We get to be on land.
[112:01.57]Now let's go out here.
[112:06.24]I'm still playing though.
[112:07.00]I heavily enjoy this game.
[112:08.74]Like I said, it's a 5 out of 10.
[112:15.73]On land, it's a 9 out of 10.
[112:17.65]In the water, it's a 5 out of 10.
[112:20.65]The review changes depending on where you are in the game.
[112:33.18]Need more potions.
[112:47.69]Why is this fucking kid in my house?
[112:48.79]Yeah, I don't know.
[112:49.63]There is a kid just in the house.
[113:01.54]Should I go for the gray baggie?
[113:07.07]First, let me see what I need.
[113:16.94]What do I need for bleeding cross?
[113:20.74]A lot of stuff that I just don't have any of.

[115:28.89]Oh, this is, uh... Oh, I like this area.
[115:30.39]Look at this.
[115:32.37]Nice land here.
[115:33.93]Solid trees.
[115:34.65]I like the boat.
[115:35.15]I like the way the hook comes down there.
[115:36.99]That's interesting.
[115:37.65]Cool.
[115:37.89]9 out of 10.
[115:40.65]Yeah.
[115:41.23]I like the snow.
[115:41.79]9 out of 10.
[115:43.81]Just turned to 5.
[115:45.24]Are we moving?
[115:49.33]Oh, the icebergs.
[115:51.31]I thought I was on, like, an airplane or something.
[115:55.18]Just gotta kill a bunch of dudes, I guess.
[116:03.82]Hot drink.
[116:06.56]I guess that's gonna be important, huh?
[116:07.78]Let's just go kill some baggies.
[116:26.67]Here they are.
[116:27.11]These are snow baggies.
[116:37.12]They're a little different.
[116:40.12]I really should be skinning these though, right?
[116:41.54]Because there's new materials that I want to get.
[116:48.09]The sword is too big.
[116:48.93]No, it's not.
[116:49.57]It's perfect.
[116:50.25]It's a perfect size.
[116:55.29]Perfect.
[117:04.33]Let's hope he didn't run into that.
[117:10.89]Double kill.
[117:11.91]Nope.
[117:19.03]I'm going S. I'm blinking here.
[117:29.28]Maybe I should drink the hot drink already?
[117:31.92]I guess.
[117:32.74]Ooh, I was shivering.
[117:33.46]Did you see my hands?
[117:34.18]My hands are shaking.
[117:50.69]Might seed.
[117:51.31]I kind of wish that would appear on the screen.
[118:00.29]I wish that would stay on the screen.
[118:01.99]That objective is 3 out of 20.
[118:02.99]Let's get some of this honey.
[118:12.49]It's not honey.
[118:17.19]It is honey.
[118:20.75]So this is a 9 slash 5 out of 10.
[118:23.39]What was Devil's Third?
[118:24.69]Says Gummy Monk.
[118:27.99]Devil's Third was a 2.
[118:32.20]A 2 out of 10.
[118:32.76]There's a Jerm of 5-5.
[118:40.06]No.
[118:40.96]I'm not.
[118:41.60]Don't listen to these people in the chat.
[118:42.72]Don't listen to the people in the chat that are talking their nonsense.
[118:44.88]5-3.
[118:47.80]No.
[118:48.96]Sorry.
[118:49.36]5-3.
[118:59.19]Just wait till some of you guys see me in real life.
[119:03.09]Like at like PAX or like E3 or something.
[119:06.21]Usually I do like a meetup and like if I'm in Seattle or something like that.
[119:11.35]And then you guys can find like, you'll be like, oh man, I can't wait to see like how fucking tiny this guy is.
[119:16.52]And you'll just realize that I'm just a regular fucking guy.
[119:21.80]Can't wait for that.
[119:30.55]There's more over here.
[119:39.91]Measure yourself on stream.
[119:44.87]I don't know why I took that a different way.
[119:47.29]I don't know why I took that a different way.
[119:53.77]I'm thinking, why would you want me to like fucking measure my, like, what are you talking about?
[119:59.93]I just pictured myself like, oh, you guys were seeing it?
[120:01.91]Alright, fine!
[120:03.15]See how big it is?
[120:06.69]Like, I have to prove that.
[120:18.03]No, no, I gotta prove myself.
[120:19.59]And then just banned.
[120:20.55]Just gone.
[120:21.05]You're fucking banned for life.
[120:33.58]Pervert streamer?
[120:34.62]No.
[120:35.16]That's not what I'm talking about.
[120:36.78]You don't have to say everything you think?
[120:40.24]Yes, I do.
[120:42.46]Of course I do.
[120:46.16]I'm a free spirit.
[120:51.55]Seven?
[120:51.95]Seven.
[121:01.29]No.

[121:40.73]Short streamer proves his blank is big.
[121:43.15]And tune in for major disappointment.

[121:53.88]Uh.
[121:54.86]Uh-uh.
[121:55.56]And this is what happens when I get bored.
[121:59.40]I'm, like, collecting fucking, like, rupees.
[122:06.06]My mind just travels when I'm doing boring shit like this.
[122:10.02]Like hitting stuff with my axe.
[122:13.00]Ooh, armature plus.
[122:13.82]Holy shit.
[122:14.31]Nice.
[122:18.43]Oh, life crystal.
[122:20.29]Earth crystal.
[122:22.49]Swap it with a fucking... Ah, I didn't put this shit away.
[122:25.01]Get out of here.
[122:27.02]Who cares about bone?
[122:27.88]It's not open.
[122:35.97]Four looks interesting.
[122:36.81]Let's take a look.
[122:37.77]How many more do I need?
[122:40.29]Ten more.
[122:43.59]Snoopin'!
[122:52.00]Sunspire Jewel.
[122:53.14]Hmm.
[123:11.57]So you're five feet tall out of ten.
[123:13.67]Mo?
[123:15.37]No, I'm not.
[123:17.69]Just discard this fucking dumb thing.
[123:19.44]Wait, that was a rare four.
[123:20.92]Whoops.
[123:21.58]Somebody's gonna be mad at me.
[123:26.86]No, you used to make bowgun ammo.
[123:28.42]Bye-bye.
[123:29.14]Don't care.
[123:34.83]Should I bust out my Wii for this?
[123:38.52]If you like games like this and you have never played it before, then... Oh, yeah, I'd say so.
[123:42.62]Why not?
[123:44.17]Why not?
[123:51.39]You asshole, come here.
[123:54.72]Yeah.
[124:08.04]Look how bad all of us are.
[124:10.26]None of us can hit each other.
[124:13.62]They're so bad they're hitting each other and I'm so bad that I can't hit any of them.
[124:18.38]It's a perfect combination of all the disasters.
[124:31.12]Thank you ChaCha for like being good at the game.
[124:38.36]I'm not even skinning them.
[124:39.14]It's not worth it.
[124:44.45]Drunk streamer flails aimlessly.
[124:46.19]Drunk streamer, what are you talking about?
[124:49.19]Easy shock trap.
[124:59.95]I don't even care.
[125:02.31]Just go away.
[125:03.47]Thank you for freeing up inventory space.
[125:09.28]Yeah, I'm gonna just jump in multiplayer, like, before I... Maybe after I fight the next boss.
[125:14.46]Because that'll give me, like, a good solid, like, hour or so in multiplayer.
[125:20.44]How long have I been streaming so far?
[125:21.52]I don't even remember.
[125:26.65]I started at, what, like, 3 o'clock?
[125:29.65]It's been, like, some... Ooh, what's that?
[125:43.45]Damn it.
[125:53.22]Shit.
[125:53.66]Iron ore.
[125:54.20]Fuck it.
[126:05.43]Got a lot of ice crystals.
[126:06.37]How many more of these things do you die?
[126:10.45]Seven.
[126:12.90]Started at like 2.15 or so.
[126:14.18]2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[126:15.54]What, I've been going for like 4 and a half hours?
[126:18.19]5 hours?
[126:20.39]Yeah, I want to do at least like a good like 7 or 8 hour stream tonight, so.
[126:25.03]We'll go until probably like 9 or 10.
[126:27.47]Eastern.
[126:32.05]Oh, there they are.
[126:34.58]Why are my emotes so shit?
[126:37.58]I don't know.
[126:43.41]I don't know, because... I mean, when you use the term shit, do you mean like... What do you mean?
[127:00.30]Only a few more need to die.
[127:01.78]Ban that guy?
[127:07.13]Ban that guy.
[127:10.93]Am I feeling more comfortable with the game?
[127:12.07]Absolutely.
[127:12.47]I'm very much enjoying myself.
[127:15.13]It's a 9 out of 10.
[127:16.79]Except in the water.
[127:41.05]Oh, I get to drink my drink.
[127:50.72]Wrap around back to three.
[127:52.46]Yeah.
[128:00.26]The water gets to a solid seven out of ten by the end of the game.
[128:02.80]It gets better.
[128:04.16]That's good.
[128:07.62]I hate this game.
[128:09.30]I did say that yesterday, didn't I?
[128:11.98]I did.
[128:13.26]I straight up said, I fucking hate this game.
[128:19.59]That's not even real, though.
[128:21.99]That was just... I was making like a YouTube video.
[128:26.53]You know?
[128:27.73]I was recording, so I had to make a YouTube video where I'm like... What the fuck?

[128:54.26]With like a snorkel on screaming.
[128:56.14]Oops.
[129:09.65]Did I go to five?
[129:10.29]I don't think I went to five.
[129:27.18]Funny tuber alert.

[135:29.09]Like, oh, would this be a waste of time for me to do it?
[135:30.81]Because I can kill a Baroth again.
[135:35.33]Is this worth replacing?
[135:36.63]Or me taking off the Jag-Eye is bad, right?
[135:42.43]You gotta make the whole set.
[135:49.73]If I can, I can upgrade the chest.
[135:51.77]17.
[135:57.17]I can upgrade three of these pieces to 17.
[136:01.72]I guess we can just do that.
[136:09.68]Baroth said is amazing.
[136:12.10]Jagi said he's good for half the game.
[136:13.78]Hmm.

[136:37.22]Well, I'll just upgrade.
[136:40.10]It's not a big deal for me right now.
[136:41.40]Let's just get these couple upgrades.

[138:18.52]Mm-hmm.
[138:19.90]I've made my decision.
[138:20.96]I've made my mind up.
[138:22.32]It's over.
[138:25.10]So, let's start collecting for Baroth.
[138:28.84]What do I need?
[138:32.42]Just kill the Baroth a bunch of times, apparently.
[138:40.03]Yep.
[138:41.41]Bearoth's gotta die.
[138:45.99]And upgrade weapons.
[138:47.26]What is it gonna take for this?

[145:40.92]I don't even know what these guys are.
[145:50.38]Start chatting, ZL.
[145:59.39]Guild card?
[146:00.09]I don't even know what this is.
[146:02.71]Okay.
[146:02.85]Okay.
[146:09.87]I'm just replying in these.
[146:18.03]Thanks for hunting.
[146:18.77]Nice to meet you.
[146:19.45]I'm just a fucking robot.
[146:27.58]Scammed?
[146:28.16]What did I just do?
[146:32.12]Robbed?
[146:32.48]Somebody robbed me?
[146:36.38]Do I go up here?
[146:37.16]I've never been to this area.
[146:38.74]Tavern?
[146:44.67]I can't go anywhere.
[146:46.19]Yeah, I can.
[146:50.56]Holy shit, look at that guy!
[146:51.48]Did you guys see that guy?
[146:56.58]What?
[146:57.62]That guy has the thing that I want.
[146:59.46]Why can't I turn the camera?
[147:07.87]Detonating the bomb.
[147:09.03]Uh-oh, we lost somebody.
[147:16.76]Sound the gong.
[147:21.04]What does that do?
[147:29.15]Let's do it.
[147:30.73]I'm ready to go.
[147:31.31]I'm ready to go fight Diablo.
[147:34.49]I'm going to fucking rob this guy.
[147:35.45]Take all of his fucking money.
[147:38.90]I feel so inadequate with this guy.
[147:41.40]Is there voice chat?
[147:42.18]How do I do it?
[147:42.52]Online.
[147:43.20]Online.
[147:46.54]Chat settings.
[147:48.52]Chat mode.
[147:52.48]Mic input on.
[148:01.20]Hey!
[148:01.55]Did that work?
[148:08.37]Hi guys!
[148:11.81]I'm going to scream into this if it worked.
[148:17.79]Can you guys hear me?
[148:18.59]Because I'm about to scream.
[148:20.45]I'm going to break my Wii U gamepad microphone.
[148:22.55]Alright, let's go.
[148:27.33]I'm initiating.
[148:31.13]Which way is it?
[148:38.61]Okay.
[148:45.93]What's going on here?
[148:49.23]How do I start the event?
[148:53.15]I'm gonna get you some Barath.
[148:57.61]No, I want... Why am I talking into the gamepad?
[148:59.67]Like, I'm... They can... They have the stream open.
[149:01.71]Alright, quests.
[149:08.33]I'm skipping every single fucking thing she's saying.
[149:10.48]I have no idea what it is.
[149:11.38]Event quests?
[149:16.76]No quests available.
[149:21.62]Well, wait.
[149:24.05]How do I fight Diablo?
[149:32.39]The horned wyvern.
[149:33.57]Hunt a Diablo.
[149:34.67]Got it.
[149:38.18]I'm in.
[149:41.90]We're in, boys and girls.
[149:50.16]I'm ready.
[149:55.44]What's that noise?
[149:55.96]Does it mean something's happening?
[150:02.18]I'm gonna put it to sleep.
[150:02.96]I'm gonna bury this motherfucker seven feet under.
[150:06.16]Get a food buff?
[150:06.96]Oh, okay.
[150:13.91]Come here.
[150:17.13]Why can I not talk to this person?
[150:19.79]That's the food cat.
[150:20.59]Why is she hiding from me?
[150:35.74]Get up!
[150:37.14]Get the fuck up, please.
[150:40.68]What's going on?
[150:46.83]Stand by for departure.
[150:47.83]I get it.
[150:53.25]Take the gift.
[150:54.71]What gift?
[150:55.21]You can drop shit on the ground in this game?
[151:03.28]I already ate him.
[151:03.92]Good.
[151:06.80]Are we ready to go?
[151:07.34]Are we doing this?
[151:08.14]Alright, here we go.
[151:23.27]Dr. Gangling, thanks for 11 months, man.
[151:28.31]This is going to be fun.
[151:30.29]Look at all this free shit.
[151:32.35]Map.
[151:36.19]Wow, this really is so much stuff in here for me.
[151:38.93]For me.
[151:45.71]Can they hear me now?
[151:46.27]Alright, where'd they go?
[151:49.27]Oh god, they're already leaving.
[151:50.07]This isn't a speedrun, guys.
[151:57.28]Oh, they can hear me.
[152:01.62]Okay, why did I just do that?
[152:04.54]I just, like, might have blown these guys' eardrums out.
[152:06.98]Why the fuck did... I just put my mouth over the microphone and fucking yelled at him.
[152:11.96]Why... Why did I do that?
[152:12.89]I'm so... Look, I'm... Guys, I'm so sorry.
[152:14.67]I just did that.
[152:17.65]I'm so sorry.
[152:18.59]Is that him?
[152:24.34]There he is.
[152:26.32]Alright, let's fight.
[152:27.88]El dio de diablo de odio de los muertos.
[152:32.16]Alright, I'll be in the back.
[152:34.00]I'll be doing support.
[152:34.68]I'll be over here flexing, don't mind me.
[152:43.44]This thing is pretty fucking huge and terrifying.
[152:57.79]I'll work on the tail.
[153:08.01]Am I cold right now?
[153:08.91]I think I'm cold.
[153:21.48]I'm not cold.
[153:22.14]What's wrong with me?
[153:25.36]We gotta paintball this guy.
[153:31.36]Marked him.
[153:33.71]I'm going to be support.
[153:36.39]That's what I'm here for.
[153:48.11]How far into the game is it?
[153:49.20]Health boost.
[153:49.88]Nice.
[153:50.36]Good job.
[153:56.30]Over here.
[153:57.92]Come on, Harry.
[153:59.64]Come on, Harry.
[154:05.45]So how much further into the game is this content?
[154:09.31]And how much of a scrub is this character?
[154:11.63]How much am I not supposed to be here right now?
[154:13.43]He's not far?
[154:18.34]Okay.
[154:20.30]He is pretty far in the game, isn't he?
[154:30.53]Level four.
[154:32.87]Oh.
[154:33.55]Get him.
[154:39.92]I'm able to swing over and over again right there.
[154:42.57]Ask me why.
[154:58.12]Shit, I didn't get it off.
[155:09.80]I feel like I have no idea what the hell I'm doing right now because of this guy.
[155:13.58]But it's okay.
[155:20.99]I think I have like all these guys with awesome items to kill this thing.
[155:28.59]Diablo is acting like me in the morning when I'm forced to get out of bed.
[155:37.91]You're getting carried?
[155:38.89]Of course I am.
[155:41.89]Well done, everybody but Jerma.
[155:43.59]I'm the guy that threw the paintball, and I'm the guy that said, carry!
[155:48.63]Got him.
[155:52.41]Nice work, guys.
[155:54.31]I knew you could do it.
[155:57.83]And this is where we get the free shit, ladies and gentlemen.
[156:00.97]Free shit.
[156:02.49]Hmm, Diablo shell.
[156:05.05]Free shit.

[156:42.65]That's great stuff.
[156:50.02]Got him.
[156:53.48]That's a pretty good scripted event right there.
[157:00.69]Alright.

[157:37.21]And then we'll move on.
[157:38.41]I mean, how do we do something else?
[157:45.70]That was fun.
[157:49.08]Let me turn off the voice chat.
[157:50.44]No, I don't want to do mic check.
[158:00.09]There you go.
[158:02.93]Fight Dire Morales.
[158:05.35]I don't know who that is.
[158:12.87]There goes your lore.
[158:18.45]Challenge quests?
[158:19.95]Leaderboards?
[158:24.84]Um... I'm not sure I can do anything else right now, right?
[158:28.00]Can I?
[158:28.26]Or do I have to go on the board?
[158:36.42]That's the final boss?
[158:43.98]Alright, you know, I'll actually... Here's what I'll do.
[158:46.00]I'll do it again.
[158:48.38]We'll get some new people in here.
[158:49.58]We'll do it again.
[158:59.75]Because I think I would pick something else.
[159:04.61]Yeah.
[159:05.07]Well, I'm going to make a new room and see who we can get people in here.
[159:12.00]It's the grill master now.
[159:17.46]Boucher placed in pouch.
[159:18.46]I don't even know what I just did.
[159:20.49]No fucking idea.
[159:27.05]Uh... How do I get out of here?
[159:30.41]I can't leave.
[159:33.95]Quit game.
[159:34.55]No.
[159:37.81]Why not just let more people in?
[159:39.17]How do I... Can I do that?
[159:40.78]I thought it was four was the max.
[159:49.61]Alright, somebody did something.
[159:50.43]There's a present somewhere.
[159:55.93]Who has the present?
[160:00.17]Potion received.
[160:01.25]Oh, thanks.
[160:04.33]Can you do... You can't?
[160:05.53]It's maxed at 4?
[160:06.33]Alright, well, let's... Alright, I'm going to go back to the lobby.
[160:24.27]Don't ask me how the fuck I do that, though.
[160:26.31]I have no idea.
[160:27.77]How do I escape?
[160:44.30]No guild cards.
[160:47.15]Isn't it this guy?
[160:49.79]Fast travel.
[160:51.29]Return to love.
[160:53.21]There we go.
[160:55.08]I'll make a new lobby.
[160:56.50]We'll do this again, then I'm going to go back to the single player.
[160:59.27]Because I don't really want to get, like, super carried.
[161:04.17]Hunter 012, target.
[161:05.71]Alright, we're going for... I don't know, like... Nibblesnarf?
[161:17.64]Alright, we're either going to do Nibblesnarf or we're going to do Wrathion.
[161:21.74]Which one of these am I doing?
[161:25.03]Nibblesnarf, Wrathion.
[161:27.07]Who's more interesting?
[161:34.67]No, we're not fighting the last boss.
[161:38.11]Nibblesnarf sounds funny.
[161:43.89]Alright, we're doing Nibblesnarf.
[161:46.79]For players, password is... Password is... Password is bun.
[161:57.06]Let's do it.
[162:06.37]That was bun.
[162:15.44]It's currently bun.
[162:16.40]I don't think I even need to eat anything.
[162:26.14]Why would I eat something when I can just get carried?
[162:33.11]Kyle, Sonos, and Sam.
[162:35.57]Hi, guys.
[162:36.79]Hello.
[162:38.81]Welcome back.
[162:42.05]Oh, well, great.
[162:43.89]Oh, there's my Nintendo Network ID.
[162:46.28]Good thing I just showed that on stream.
[162:54.18]Oh, well.
[163:01.49]Uh, how do I... Is it ZL?
[163:09.22]Leaked.
[163:12.88]Look, hey, if you, like, get a hold of my Nintendo Network ID, like, I mean, honest to God... I don't know who gives a shit.
[163:20.86]Like, what?
[163:24.82]Don't worry, I got fucking... I just... It's... Whatever.
[163:28.31]Who cares?
[163:34.17]Are you ready?
[163:35.65]Ready to do this?
[163:36.21]Let's go get the Scribble Scarf, whatever his name is.
[163:42.24]Hunt a Nibble Scarf.
[163:44.20]Snarf.
[163:44.54]Let's do it.
[163:51.40]Hey, thanks, Devil.
[163:53.20]You can just ask them to use rank-appropriate gear and have fun.
[163:58.28]Yeah, we could do that, but, you know.
[164:05.82]We'll see.
[164:06.04]If this one's underwater, it better not be.
[164:17.61]Hoo, hoo, hoo!
[164:23.55]Oh, I'm getting hungry.
[164:27.43]I am getting really hungry.
[164:49.76]Fuck, I'm just trying to be a dick.
[164:51.08]Okay, I have to paint follow because I'm the only one that has them.
[164:57.87]Wanted some pizza?
[164:58.63]Oh, I didn't get a map.
[165:07.93]No, I don't want pizza right now.
[165:16.46]These guys are already ahead.
[165:19.94]See, I wanna be worthful.
[165:21.80]I wanna be worthful.
[165:25.51]Worth... I wanna be worth it.
[165:27.15]I wanna be... useful.
[165:38.81]I am getting hungry, holy shit.
[165:51.06]Where is he?
[165:51.54]He's probably dead already.
[166:02.68]Oh, is he one of the dolphins?
[166:06.19]Wow!
[166:07.49]This thing's cool.
[166:11.13]I gotta paintball it.
[166:14.79]Marked him.
[166:16.33]You can't say I didn't do anything.
[166:26.21]This would be fairly annoying.
[166:40.48]Woo!
[166:47.69]Get away!
[167:03.47]Get rid of the ads.
[167:09.91]Yeah, I'll do that.
[167:11.68]That'll be my duty.
[167:12.48]I know it won't.
[167:15.86]I'm gonna be too busy here.
[167:16.64]I don't know.
[167:18.30]I'll get the ads.
[167:21.34]Adam midair.
[167:22.60]Y'all saw that.
[167:25.66]Please clap.
[167:32.35]That didn't hit.
[167:34.01]It's already dead.
[167:34.65]Alright, we're fine.
[167:37.76]I can make up access!
[167:39.20]Yeah, I'm the little brother with the controller.
[167:45.38]There we go.
[167:50.22]There we go.
[167:51.90]He's stunned.
[168:01.89]Whoa, but it's buff!
[168:09.48]That was close.
[168:12.42]He's dead.
[168:18.31]Well, this jury is easy.
[168:27.27]I'm going to paralyze it.
[168:33.25]He almost got eight.
[168:34.99]What would even happen?
[168:36.09]Can you even do that?
[168:46.35]Vivid fluid.
[168:48.40]That sounds kind of gross.
[168:54.58]That was fun.
[168:55.68]Thanks, guys.
[169:14.03]That just broke my neck.
[169:17.05]That's a shattered vertebra.
[169:29.81]This is cheating.
[169:30.89]I'm cheating right now.
[169:35.03]I'm going back to single player.
[169:36.13]This is cheating.
[169:43.35]a guppy desu thank you for the sub and twin go Dr.. Gangly and also subscribed for 11 months Almost to my year, and it's been well worth it always glad to see you streaming more often now makes my day better.

[170:14.14]Yeah, but I feel like... I feel like this is just me cheating.
[170:18.54]But thanks for playing, those of you guys that played.
[170:23.43]I'm not ruling out doing it again.
[170:25.13]I'd like to make my own progress, rather than just get fucking, like, carried.
[170:36.56]It is fun, though.
[170:43.23]Back to single player.
[170:46.33]That's not the right way.
[170:48.99]No, I made a new character just for this.
[170:52.08]I'm not done with multiplayer.
[170:53.20]I'm just... For the moment, I am.
[170:57.10]For the moment.
[171:00.28]Back to marina.
[171:01.90]No, tavern.
[171:08.76]I thought it was going to be funnier.
[171:14.69]Oh, I'm hungry.
[171:17.51]Where the hell did I just end up?
[171:19.21]What the fuck?
[171:21.43]Huh?
[171:22.69]How did I... What is going on here?
[171:29.10]How did this guy get into my game?
[171:30.44]I have to hire this guy for $50?
[171:33.70]Huh?
[171:53.55]I think I just paid him 50 cents.
[171:58.96]Where's he going?
[172:06.67]I am so fucking confused right now.
[172:11.89]Did I just send him on a mission?
[172:19.81]Does that guy have to go do stuff and fight on my behalf?
[172:23.23]Alright, I want to go back to the other place.
[172:34.84]What was the other place called?
[172:35.70]Oh boy.
[172:38.68]You sent me on a quest.
[172:40.94]Alright.
[172:45.42]How do I get out of this?
[172:46.42]I want to just go back to where I was before.
[172:52.36]Fast travel to Moga Village.
[172:54.04]There we go.
[172:58.18]I paid him 50 bits to leave.
[172:59.67]Hey, thanks a lot, Inti, for four months.
[173:02.13]He says cha-ching.
[173:03.41]Well, thank you.
[173:03.85]Alright, let's store all this stuff, although it might be already stored.
[173:09.05]I'm getting so hungry.
[173:11.03]Maybe like another 30 minutes or so.
[173:12.13]Man, I really need to eat something.
[173:22.06]Voucher.
[173:25.11]Okay.
[173:38.26]10?
[173:38.30]Well done, steak.
[173:39.10]Damn.
[173:44.60]Let's go do another quest or so, and then I'm probably going to stop streaming in the next 30 minutes or so.
[173:50.67]That means I would have been streaming for like about six or seven hours or so.
[173:54.19]Something like that.
[173:56.07]Six.
[173:57.01]Plus.
[173:57.35]I don't know.
[173:57.63]We'll see.
[174:02.69]Hunter killer.
[174:06.96]Let's go for the fucking legombi.
[174:11.40]After I eat something.
[174:13.94]And make more stuff.
[174:17.32]Use a voucher.
[174:29.16]On some Barats off stream.
[174:30.38]I will probably do that.
[174:33.26]24... I never said 24 hour stream.
[174:35.02]I said like 6 to 8.
[174:36.20]24 hour.
[174:39.41]I will never be able to do a 24 hour stream.
[174:42.99]Ever.
[174:45.93]Do I have any more blue mushrooms?
[174:57.70]I do.
[174:57.92]I have seven.
[174:59.74]So I just need herbs.
[175:03.58]Okie dokie.
[175:15.04]Business breakthrough.
[175:15.96]Oh, now you sell potions, huh?
[175:29.75]I can just buy an absolute shitload of these, huh?
[175:32.87]Is this a stupid idea?
[175:35.71]Too late.
[175:45.38]Am I gonna stream this game again?
[175:56.34]Yes.
[176:01.14]Yes, I am.
[176:13.02]Potion.
[176:20.08]Okay.
[176:20.30]Now I don't have to get any more blue mushrooms.
[176:22.25]That's perfect.
[176:25.79]Do I need to carry these mega nutrients?
[176:35.17]I can get rid of the cool drink.
[176:37.65]And let's try to fight that boss.
[176:49.48]Alright, let's go.
[176:50.00]Let's give it a try.
[176:53.73]How many west stones do I have?
[176:56.93]14, that's fine.
[177:01.31]Alright, let's go.
[177:02.51]Let's do it.
[177:03.51]Solo content.
[177:06.94]We are going to do... Hunt a Legombe.
[177:13.26]Oh, I didn't even buy hot drinks.
[177:26.51]Let's do it.
[177:31.53]Hunt a Legombe.
[177:37.18]Here we go.
[177:38.82]Wish me luck.
[177:44.48]Can I pre-order the Jerma anime?
[177:45.98]Well, thank you, Magpie, for the $3.50.
[177:50.98]Jerma anime.
[177:54.00]That's a good question.
[178:03.56]Easy flash bomb.
[178:04.71]I mean, I guess I'll just take it.
[178:08.09]Let's go.
[178:08.45]I have a lot of max health.
[178:12.89]This is actually great.
[178:17.78]What are these things?
[178:18.26]That's not a Legombe, is it?
[178:21.06]Well, whatever it is.
[178:21.70]It's dead.
[178:23.00]Okay.
[178:35.80]I guess I could skin them, right?
[178:46.17]By the way, the Legombe was the easy monster in the demo of the game.
[178:49.99]Well, then I should be... Alright, look, look, what's happening?
[178:55.33]Do you see what's happening right now?
[178:56.47]Why does that happen?
[178:59.67]I have not let go.
[179:00.39]I have not let go yet.
[179:02.69]Why the fuck is that happening?
[179:06.27]Now I let go.
[179:07.65]What?
[179:07.85]That's confusing.
[179:12.02]By every stretch of the word.
[179:18.62]The Gumby's a lot of fun.
[179:19.70]Cool.
[179:20.96]Looking forward to it.
[179:31.51]Found him.
[179:38.09]Is this little guy?
[179:39.01]Is this tiny little Ewok?
[179:52.48]There he is.
[180:05.39]That's that.
[180:08.15]And let's go.
[180:20.47]Don't run out of the level.
[180:21.43]Wow, he slides around.
[180:22.43]I got to get you away from this corner.
[180:30.23]Ow.
[180:43.59]Very slow against this guy.
[180:45.23]I'm trying to go through his legs.
[180:59.31]This ain't Dark Souls.
[181:00.05]You can't do that.
[181:19.01]Evaded.
[181:19.49]Shit.
[181:48.49]Damn.
[181:48.81]I wasn't expecting that.
[181:50.87]What was that?
[182:01.32]Hello.
[182:02.28]Tello.
[182:04.62]Alright, his stomach can't be hit.
[182:10.70]Good to know.
[182:30.59]Ow.
[182:32.05]Why don't I just stay behind him?
[182:56.14]You must drift to beat the drifter.
[183:03.03]He's backing up now.
[183:03.79]Not cool.
[183:08.15]Getting greedy.
[183:13.69]What?
[183:19.37]What?
[183:20.53]What the fuck is with these iframes?
[183:21.95]Fuck you.
[183:30.67]I thought he hit the wall.
[183:40.56]Alright, finally!
[183:52.74]Get over here!
[184:00.89]I wish I could charge his fucking weapon.
[184:03.77]Finally.
[184:04.96]Oh, he's... No, he's not stunned.
[184:09.56]He is running, though.
[184:18.39]Doing the face slide.
[184:21.15]Whoa, you're right in front of me.
[184:24.07]Alright, I gotta go now.
[184:26.31]God damn it.
[184:26.97]Just gotta connect with one hit.
[184:28.21]This hit.
[184:29.15]Got it.
[184:30.69]That's all I care about.
[184:31.55]Do it again.
[184:43.36]Fuck.
[184:56.53]Whoa, what just happened there?
[184:59.59]That was odd.
[185:14.52]I'm not going to dodge this time.
[185:15.72]I'm just going to go around it like that.
[185:19.58]That was an opportunity that I missed.
[185:23.68]And here come the little shits.
[185:39.86]Shit.
[185:41.74]Oh well.
[186:03.60]One more hit, and then start it up.
[186:05.28]Now I'm gonna wait till he goes.
[186:06.58]I'll just do it now, fuck it.
[186:26.15]I'll get him!
[186:29.28]You fucking little dick.
[186:31.96]No, get... Look for me, I did another spin.
[186:35.85]You see my spin?
[186:38.25]You are fucking this up for me, big time.
[186:41.79]You are seriously making this a fucking major pain in the ass.
[186:48.66]Run.
[186:49.82]Run.
[186:51.28]I don't care.
[186:54.38]You fucking stupid thing.
[186:59.95]Get away from me.
[187:02.15]Thank god.
[187:03.85]Fuck off.
[187:13.15]There it happens again.
[187:13.95]I wanted to heal.
[187:21.24]Doesn't matter anymore.
[187:27.82]Whoops.
[187:36.29]Come over here.
[187:39.21]Do that again.
[187:43.21]Ow.
[187:49.77]Press L before.
[187:50.49]That's what I'm doing.
[187:52.86]How would I be able to scroll if I wasn't doing that?
[187:58.64]You know.
[188:04.01]I almost had it too.
[188:10.21]Shit.
[188:21.11]Come back.
[188:21.39]You can do this all day, Lamborghini, whatever your name is.
[188:42.26]Is he gonna run?
[188:44.18]Limping, we win.
[188:45.38]That's what that means.
[188:51.15]How do I get in front of them?
[188:55.25]Pressing Y too early?
[189:03.12]I need to get at the end of a dodge so I can complete my stupid plan.
[189:09.14]And right now.
[189:12.78]There it is.
[189:21.35]Got it!
[189:30.31]What is this?
[189:30.95]Look at this encasing over here.
[189:32.59]That's interesting.
[189:39.68]What the fuck just happened?
[189:49.70]This boss is pretty fun.
[189:51.18]I like this one.
[189:55.00]You're about to see a real bad day.
[189:59.71]Don't go that way.
[190:00.95]I could trap him if I really wanted to, but you know.
[190:04.27]No.
[190:05.05]Ain't gonna happen.
[190:17.59]Won't be long now.
[190:21.33]And it's time to fuck him up.
[190:52.25]No mega potions used here either.
[191:01.02]At least not yet.
[191:01.78]I'm hoping he'll die.
[191:03.68]Nah, fuck it.
[191:05.32]I'm going to play it safe.
[191:07.62]It would be such a mistake if I were to die here for some reason.
[191:21.35]That move always gets me.
[191:35.65]No, no, no, no.
[191:39.94]He knocked me out of the area.
[191:41.46]Dick.
[191:42.92]You dick.
[191:57.96]I just want to get the fuck away from the stupid zoning area.
[192:01.92]Why?
[192:03.06]Why have that possible?
[192:04.84]I could fucking complain if I want.
[192:06.12]No, no complaining.
[192:07.60]As much as that is fucking stupid.
[192:09.90]And how much I fucking despise that.
[192:13.17]It's over.
[192:13.55]If he runs in a new area, look at the mini-map, right?
[192:21.79]When they get in a new area, if you chase them, they shouldn't be standing right here.
[192:26.98]They should be fucking like a hundred feet in.
[192:29.88]Makes that so... How do you not know that?
[192:35.82]How would you not fix that?
[192:37.48]Huh?
[192:39.69]This guy's gonna steal one of these fucking things, isn't he?
[192:43.57]Please get out of here.
[192:51.48]I missed him.
[192:52.62]I missed him.
[192:57.92]Let the complaints go through you.
[193:02.28]They fix that in later games?
[193:05.56]Thank you, Chacho.
[193:20.49]Putting his foot down.
[193:25.07]By the way, these screenshots have all been so bad.
[193:29.65]They just take a random screenshot when you're up a boss's ass.
[193:47.59]He was fun, though.
[193:51.57]I like that one.
[193:52.09]That one was fun.
[193:56.89]The Ligaracrus has been sighted again in Mogha's waters.
[193:59.55]You know what that means.
[194:06.49]Special organs on its back.
[194:08.85]Watch out for those.
[194:09.64]It's a lovely sight.
[194:12.14]Okay.
[194:17.94]So now the Ligarius, whatever it is.
[194:19.60]This is the next big urgent quest or something.
[194:23.96]Is that underwater?
[194:33.43]Oh, no.
[194:47.76]It's a 50-50 shot if it's gonna be underwater or not.
[194:51.50]No, I'm not doing it.
[194:58.90]Oh, it's the first guy.
[195:00.26]Oh, God.
[195:12.18]Let's go dump our shit.
[195:13.48]Eat something.
[195:15.36]And then rage that we have to go underwater again.
[195:26.82]That sucks.
[195:37.45]Got plenty of potions.
[195:38.43]Plenty of whetstones.
[195:44.35]I'm not going to use it.
[195:45.80]I have to go eat in real life.
[195:52.04]After this attempt, I'm going to take off.
[195:58.19]I'm going to take off after this.
[196:02.83]This is do or die.
[196:06.27]Get better sharpness?
[196:07.08]I have to wait.
[196:08.36]Because...
[196:10.91]The upgrade path that I'm going on with this katana right now, it looks like this.
[196:23.26]So... Bleeding Cross is what I want, but I don't have any of the stuff that I need for it.
[196:32.42]I thought it was a six to seven hour stream.
[196:34.82]It is.
[196:35.08]I started at like two or three o'clock in the afternoon.
[196:40.57]It is.
[196:44.37]New sword craft.
[196:45.27]I guess I could look at them, right?
[196:59.98]Fairly close on this one.
[197:01.54]Wind eater.
[197:02.20]Let's see.
[197:03.12]Ooh.
[197:05.43]That's cool looking.
[197:14.42]Gears of War weapon?
[197:15.35]Cool.
[197:23.07]None of these are green until you get to the rare ones.
[197:28.46]It's got a lot of green sharpness, too.
[197:30.72]This thing is great.
[197:34.84]Thunderbug.
[197:35.48]I'd have to go bug collecting for a while.
[197:44.07]Cataclysm sword.
[197:47.87]I'm really close to this.
[197:49.09]I need one monster bone and then two monster bone plus.
[197:53.83]And I can make this thing.
[198:00.96]Okay.
[198:04.40]Get the iron katana.
[198:09.92]And what?
[198:10.18]Just upgrade it like two times?
[198:19.46]Chainsword.
[198:20.02]I don't have enough materials for it.
[198:28.49]I can just... I'll wait.
[198:29.31]Whatever.
[198:36.24]Drowning shaft looks decent enough, but I need to kill Royal Lutrith again.
[198:46.92]I have one, but... I can go to Iron Grace, which will make it green.
[198:54.79]Is it worth having just that little bit of green for this guy?
[198:59.73]Should I do this?
[199:06.00]Is it really that big of a deal?
[199:07.58]I mean, I'm going to lose attack power.
[199:17.14]Alright.
[199:17.48]Let's put it on.
[199:22.96]Let's take a look.
[199:24.28]Iron Gospel.
[199:26.80]I mean, this is at 330 versus 396.
[199:35.43]I mean, at this stage right now, I should still be using that.
[199:49.46]I mean, to get it to Iron Gospel, I need Makalite.
[199:55.00]So, are we going to... Are we doing Makalite?
[199:59.85]Are we going to do another Makalite stream?
[200:15.86]Green lets you actually start hitting.
[200:22.72]Alright, well, let's go get five Makolite.
[200:26.30]I'll give it a try.
[200:30.72]Sharpness is much more important.
[200:32.30]Okay.
[200:33.76]Yeah, 24-hour Makolite stream.
[200:35.16]You heard it here.
[200:35.96]I'm so hungry, though.
[200:38.88]Where do I need to go?
[200:39.68]Just into the... Do I have any?
[200:45.00]Yeah, I have three.
[200:45.60]I'll get two more.
[200:53.05]It's a macaroni stream.
[201:02.16]Gives you a damage modifier as well.
[201:03.48]Alright.
[201:04.62]Well, whatever.
[201:12.37]You can't believe I've gotten that far with yellow sharpness?
[201:14.89]Really?
[201:18.95]Let's test it.
[201:20.91]Wow!
[201:21.45]Already a huge difference.
[201:29.22]Going up to 12.
[201:29.64]See if we can get five in one run.
[201:39.79]Yeah, the real me has to eat here soon.
[201:48.67]See you, Vayne, over there.
[202:00.35]Let's get real lucky.
[202:01.97]Get me really lucky and just get five in a row.
[202:14.88]70% of total attack power.
[202:16.22]Yeah, that does kind of suck.
[202:21.90]Yeah, we'll get the five macaroni.
[202:26.67]Then after that... Oh shit, it's one of those.
[202:30.11]One of those dodo bird things.
[202:32.05]I don't care.
[202:42.84]So we'll get the five we need, upgrade this iron katana, and then we'll do the other rage-inducing water boss, and then whatever happens after that, that's where I'll be ending the stream.
[202:58.99]Eat on face cam?
[203:06.40]Kim was talking about doing like a social eating stream.
[203:09.38]It'd be like kind of fun.
[203:12.25]Maybe one day.
[203:13.83]Missed a spot.
[203:14.39]There was a blue spot.
[203:15.05]I can go back and get it.
[203:15.93]We're in free mode right now.
[203:16.79]It's all good.
[203:21.45]There's one right there.
[203:29.22]But I will say ever since switching to the katana...
[203:34.01]my enjoyment of this game has become so much higher.
[203:41.28]That sword and shield combo was so painful for me to use.
[203:49.54]Chat's been saying that for years.
[203:52.35]Years?
[203:52.87]What do you mean years?
[203:57.29]Okay.
[204:04.61]Makes you happy to see I'm enjoying one of your favorite game series.
[204:09.41]It is fun.
[204:15.26]Nothing in this.
[204:16.90]Finally.
[204:18.16]I need more than one.
[204:24.34]Nope.
[204:26.28]Okie dokie.
[204:52.71]Let's try another spot.
[204:55.39]One is still pretty lucky.
[204:56.99]Yeah, they are fairly rare.
[204:57.91]Let's go back to eight.
[205:04.42]Flooded Forest, Harvest Tour.
[205:05.72]Yeah, we can do that.
[205:08.04]Now, I'm not on a quest, so I can just get the fuck out of here, right?
[205:21.41]Flooded Forest.
[205:27.12]Alright, Chacha, come here.
[205:27.98]Did you get one?
[205:34.60]He got one.
[205:35.12]I need three more.
[205:41.76]Three more and we can keep going.
[205:46.25]Now, how do you just get to areas?
[205:50.13]Because I can just walk to the right and go to the woods.
[205:52.71]How do I just get to the other areas without having to do a quest?
[205:57.67]Are there certain areas that I have to walk to?
[205:59.37]Because why can't... The Moga Woods area over here.
[206:03.79]I can just zone into this.
[206:06.79]Can I just zone into the other areas?
[206:08.73]Okay.
[206:31.86]Harvest tour.
[206:32.68]Tundra.
[206:33.22]No.
[206:34.40]Harvest tour.
[206:35.16]I guess I could do that one again.
[206:37.06]No, we'll just do it again.
[206:40.06]You can just do it again, right?
[206:48.12]No, it's your home turf.
[206:49.04]Okay.
[207:02.16]Now, last time they were in, what, five and six?
[207:09.58]From what I remember.
[207:13.18]My inventory is full.
[207:16.76]I'm only coming here for one reason anyways.
[207:19.20]I just want to mine.
[207:25.20]Oh, I'm getting hungry.
[207:26.36]I'm getting hungry.
[207:52.60]Chacha, I needed your assistance.
[207:55.12]You weren't here.
[208:09.46]I didn't want to go this way.
[208:10.36]I want to go down.
[208:12.20]Actually, I want to go up and then down.
[208:17.21]I want to wrap all the way around.
[208:18.71]We'll go from eight to six to five to four to two.
[208:32.68]So when you guys talk about the side fade slash, right?
[208:35.00]So X and A at the same time does the fade slash.
[208:39.52]If I hold X and A at the same time while holding a direction, it has to be the end of a combo.
[208:46.44]So like... Okay.
[208:52.52]Like one, two... How come that didn't work?
[208:57.28]Okay.
[209:00.79]Okay.
[209:02.25]So it has to be at the end of a combo.
[209:04.05]You have to be holding it.
[209:10.35]I think I'm figuring it out.
[209:11.69]Why is that not working?
[209:39.37]Just after an attack.
[209:55.67]I'm holding left right now, right?
[209:57.01]I'm holding left.
[210:00.41]Is it like a certain timing thing where you have to hit them both at the same time?
[210:03.13]Because sometimes I feel like it doesn't work.
[210:07.78]I'm definitely not forgetting to hold the direction.
[210:10.16]So I'm doing XX, XA while holding left.
[210:13.50]And I went backwards.
[210:19.42]He's holding left right there.
[210:25.95]So you have to hold left before the swing even happens, then.
[210:29.71]So I have to hold, like, for instance... If I hold left right now, then it should happen, right?
[210:34.97]Yep, okay.
[210:40.97]I think I got it.
[210:41.53]Yeah, I got it.
[210:45.27]Yep, there you go.
[210:51.83]Didn't do it that time.
[210:56.08]Yep.
[210:56.28]Alright, I get it.
[211:04.96]You just have to buffer the input, essentially.
[211:07.96]So while you're doing that second swing with any swing, you have to be holding the different direction with X and A. Let's get down here.
[211:22.63]Let's see another spot.
[211:35.49]What?
[211:37.15]Huh?
[211:40.22]Have I gone insane or did that just disappear?
[211:44.78]I don't know.
[212:05.81]Get out of here, please.
[212:07.73]I just want to mine.
[212:12.11]I don't want to fight monsters right now.
[212:14.62]What is this?
[212:15.00]A monster hunting game?
[212:24.67]Cranked.
[212:29.99]I don't think I got any from that.
[212:33.53]That sucks.
[212:40.00]Move around to six, to five, to four, to two.
[212:41.94]Is there any in the water?
[212:50.61]I can't tell.
[212:51.15]What am I going to eat?
[212:53.41]Right here.
[213:09.66]One day he'll look back and appreciate all the Earth crystals.
[213:14.29]I'm getting a lot of this ore, too.
[213:16.43]This Pelagicite.
[213:25.37]Well, that was... I'll take that.
[213:28.80]That's fine.
[213:33.72]Any more?
[213:38.63]Only one.
[213:39.42]That's not cool.
[213:42.02]I'm going to make bacon and eggs.
[213:43.02]That's what I'm going to do.
[213:44.04]I have eggs and I have bacon.
[213:45.00]It's going to be great.
[214:00.99]Let me get a better look.
[214:07.21]Nothing on the surface.
[214:12.87]Are my eyes not burned out yet?
[214:14.37]Oh, getting close.
[214:17.05]Getting there.
[214:20.50]Not 100%, but we're getting there.
[214:21.64]That's fine.
[214:23.86]Bacon and eggs for dinner.
[214:24.62]That's right.
[214:24.96]With some toast.
[214:25.44]How am I going to make the eggs?
[214:32.38]Scrambled or over easy?
[214:33.20]What do you guys think?
[214:44.13]Please continue to be stupid so I can just get this over with.
[214:48.45]Damn it.
[214:53.43]I need to go this way.
[214:56.40]Scrambled?
[214:57.70]See, actually, yeah, you know what?
[214:58.72]I'm gonna do a... That sounds good.
[215:01.82]Two eggs scrambled?
[215:02.56]No, no.
[215:02.92]We're doing, like, four eggs scrambled.
[215:06.86]Four eggs scrambled.
[215:08.17]Like, five pieces of bacon.
[215:09.83]Toast.
[215:12.76]And some Captain Crunch for a complete breakfast.
[215:21.92]I usually do over easy.
[215:23.78]That's how I get my eggs almost every other time I get eggs.
[215:35.49]Well, shit.
[215:38.77]I'm glad the only blue vein that we found
[215:44.33]Did not have anything in it.
[215:49.35]This asshole again.
[215:59.82]Eat the shells.
[216:04.94]Should I just go back to eight?
[216:05.93]Would it have been potentially respawned at this point?
[216:10.85]Give it a try.
[216:16.52]let's try eight again alright I haven't been to two yet stream the egg eating no no no no
[216:46.98]Alright, come on, two.
[216:49.60]Give me something to work with here.
[216:52.28]I need to go eat.
[216:54.66]I need three more Malachite.
[217:00.47]I don't see it over here.
[217:01.53]It's not buried behind this, is it?
[217:11.07]Come on, game.
[217:12.29]Come on.
[217:12.91]How do you make a complete breakfast?
[217:15.41]It's easy.
[217:26.62]Where?
[217:31.86]Where and why are there no nodes being spawned?
[217:39.41]What is this malice shite?
[217:51.24]What a bunch of dog shite.
[217:53.10]Dog sheet.
[218:00.87]Well.

[218:06.87]I'm almost at a... There we go.
[218:14.58]Come on.
[218:16.96]Two more.
[218:19.29]Two more.
[218:20.65]Yes!
[218:23.67]Alright.
[218:24.79]Come on, ChaCha.
[218:25.56]You gotta be a hero here.
[218:27.62]Be a hero.
[218:29.86]Please tell me that you have looted one.
[218:32.64]Please.
[218:33.26]You have to have done it.
[218:40.79]Find one more.
[218:43.55]Well, do we roll the dice and hopefully he mined one?
[218:46.03]I guess I can jump in the water and save everything in there.
[218:55.83]Anything?
[218:56.23]Alright, pray.
[219:01.10]Say your prayers.
[219:01.78]We're going to teleport back and hopefully he has one.
[219:06.82]Yeah, let's go.
[219:10.08]Wait.
[219:11.72]Ah, no, no, no.
[219:12.54]Okay, okay.
[219:13.36]Yeah, I have to just use the key card thing.
[219:15.66]I'm going to put my key card in.
[219:29.19]Oh, I'm going to eat my own head.
[219:31.15]I might not even be able to do Ligarius.
[219:36.43]But I have to do one attempt.
[219:39.65]If I play terrible Ligarius, it's because I'm tired and hungry.
[219:48.21]Might be a spot in three.
[219:49.23]Can I climb this?
[219:52.13]Yeah.
[220:02.14]Yeah, Ligarius.
[220:03.10]Oh, there's another one.
[220:09.33]Right there.
[220:15.45]Come on.
[220:17.17]Malachite.
[220:19.25]That's not Malachite.
[220:21.71]That's not it either.
[220:22.53]That's also not Malachite.
[220:27.31]That is not it either.
[220:28.33]Okay, bye.
[220:31.04]Cha-cha's the hero.
[220:41.36]No, my pickaxe is going to break anyways.
[220:45.45]Time to go.
[220:52.63]Time to go, Ligarius.
[220:53.71]Shit.
[221:32.34]Come on, Cha-Cha.
[221:36.68]Get this upgrade done so we can attempt this boss.
[221:42.35]Please.
[221:44.13]And then I can go eat food.
[221:46.57]It'd be great if you would do that.
[221:53.23]Should've gotten rid of the dung.
[221:54.05]Alright, cross your fingers.
[221:57.93]Hold your fingers crossed.
[221:58.75]Pellet S+, dude.
[222:14.02]I'm looking for that blue, that blue outline.
[222:16.80]Come on.
[222:24.56]Come on.
[222:28.70]Oh, you didn't get it.
[222:31.98]Let me double check.
[222:40.04]I need one more.
[222:42.86]God damn it.
[222:46.08]Oh well.
[222:55.29]You know what they say.
[222:56.11]Fuck the world.
[223:01.42]Who says that?
[223:01.98]I don't know.
[223:21.41]I need five more.
[223:22.43]What do you mean five more?
[223:27.97]Fuck the world.
[223:29.29]You know what they say.
[223:33.85]I'm hoping that I can just go from one to eight and it's done.
[223:41.61]Yeah, I have four.
[223:42.27]I just need one.
[223:43.65]I have four in my chest.
[223:53.21]Don't even need to jump down.
[223:54.09]That was right.
[223:57.80]First try.
[223:58.64]No, second try.
[224:01.70]Third try.
[224:16.61]Well.
[224:26.51]Dumb.
[224:37.71]No.
[224:42.29]Fucking hell.
[224:46.87]Fucking hell.
[224:50.24]I can't believe these ribs are fantastic.
[224:54.30]Fucking hell.

[224:59.30]The pie, the crust is amazing.
[225:02.80]It's fantastic.
[225:05.07]Fucking hell.
[225:32.89]It's raw.
[225:35.95]You can't serve this.
[225:37.21]It's raw.
[225:38.05]I'm sorry, Chef.
[225:40.41]I didn't mean to serve raw hamburger meat.
[225:42.90]Listen, listen, listen to me.
[225:43.76]Listen to me.
[225:44.12]You can't do that.
[225:45.78]You serve that to someone, they'll get sick.
[225:49.10]Chef, I'm so sorry.
[225:49.88]I didn't mean to.
[225:50.52]I just put raw hamburger meat in between two pieces of bread.
[225:54.47]What am I supposed to... Ow!
[225:56.05]Ow!
[225:57.85]Get back in the kitchen and you fix that fucking meal.
[226:03.51]I don't even... Did I get one?
[226:07.53]I don't even know if I got one.
[226:08.67]I don't know.
[226:16.50]It's... I told you.

[226:22.12]It's so boring.
[226:23.36]So I just start going off.

[226:27.04]I can't stop it.

[226:40.67]Get away from me.
[226:42.01]Get away from me.

[226:48.81]Right now I'm gonna get it and Gordon Ramsey is gonna be so proud of me.

[231:00.95]I'm just gonna do it.

[231:02.29]I'm gonna be crafting shit, like, for a little while.
[231:07.44]I don't think anyways.

[232:00.91]That face went.
[232:01.57]Alright, what do we got?
[232:07.53]Let's throw this shit in the trash.
[232:12.57]Let's go fight Ligarius.

[232:38.78]Let's fight him.
[232:45.82]Nutri Mega Potions.
[232:46.66]Alright, let's go.
[232:48.72]Let's do that quest.
[232:54.07]Repel a Ligarius.
[232:59.22]Let's kill this motherfucker.
[233:11.26]Hmm, so the time of reckoning has come.
[233:12.52]It appears the terrifying Ligarius has emerged from the sea.
[233:15.28]It's been spotted as close as Area 5.
[233:18.37]As you well know, kid, the Ligara, you cross-course, is one bad beast.
[233:21.87]Now, I would have handled him easily when I was your age.
[233:24.54]Sure, yeah, however, yeah, a long way.
[233:26.28]Who cares?
[233:28.10]Who cares about the storyline?
[233:29.40]I don't really care about the story.
[233:34.25]Hmm...
[233:48.36]Let's get him.
[233:59.75]Round two.
[234:00.43]Remember when you killed me like 14 hours ago, whatever it was?
[234:06.06]Not this time.
[234:16.80]He's actually fairly huge.
[234:21.80]I'm actually kind of scared.
[234:22.98]Alright.
[234:25.34]Time to concentrate.
[234:37.39]This run is so stupid.
[234:40.67]Right when I get over here, really.
[234:44.63]Watch that stamina.
[234:48.65]Let's get that tail cut off.
[235:25.76]oh that hit me wow that's kind of scary
[235:55.00]I'm gonna try the other side.
[235:56.36]I don't like how he moves when I'm on his left side.
[235:59.26]Fuck.
[236:16.96]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[236:25.77]Woo!
[236:27.43]God damn it.
[236:33.79]Let's stay topped off if we can.
[236:42.26]I'd love to build my combo up, but I don't have an opportunity to hit him like two or three times.
[236:59.66]Stuck inside of his body.
[237:02.18]That's not where I want to be.
[237:02.94]Remember I was talking shit about Frank?
[237:17.57]Fire the guy that made the flex after drinking.
[237:20.59]You know what?
[237:21.23]Throw that guy down a well.
[237:27.77]Do like the fucking old, like, cartoon goofy, like... I've made that joke before.
[237:32.95]I can't do that again.
[237:34.27]That's like the fourth time I've done that joke.
[237:37.43]I'm not allowed to do that again.
[237:38.25]There he goes.
[237:52.26]I didn't throw a paintball at him either.
[237:53.54]Oh well.
[238:01.67]Do I even need to throw paintballs anymore?
[238:03.19]I feel like I understand what's going on.
[238:06.39]I'll just do it for fun, I don't know.
[238:21.38]God damn, that's such a bunch of shit.
[238:45.47]Come on, dive over here.
[238:49.51]ChaCha did something?
[238:51.81]Remarkable!
[239:02.44]That tail swing is hard to know when it's gonna come.
[239:13.94]Do it!
[239:18.54]Got it.
[239:18.80]Thank God.
[239:30.01]No!
[239:31.23]Wake up!
[239:32.57]Wake up!
[239:56.76]Get around him, please.
[239:58.48]Nope.
[240:11.21]Come on, you sack of shit.
[240:21.97]Almost time to do it again.
[240:23.05]It is time to do it again.
[240:25.38]No, it's not.
[240:25.80]He's gonna run.
[240:33.33]No, don't tell me he's gonna be in the water now.
[240:38.31]Oh, he's right here.
[240:41.51]Alright, let's queue it up.
[240:49.41]Activate the VAT system.
[240:52.56]Come on.
[240:55.38]Got it.
[240:55.80]Nice.
[240:57.74]I'm happy about that.
[241:00.00]Get out of the way.
[241:10.31]I really want to cut his tail, but... Whoa!
[241:12.85]Wow!
[241:13.55]Okay.
[241:14.01]Oh, fuck.
[241:15.73]Oh, fuck.
[241:31.43]got it got it that's it right I'm kind of electro zappered right now
[242:01.31]I'm going to wait for him to do... No, go to Cha-Cha.
[242:02.97]Come on, Cha-Cha.
[242:03.55]Be a hero.
[242:06.59]Scripted.
[242:08.95]Okay, I do admit that did seem a little scripted.
[242:12.75]But it is not.
[242:13.53]I promise.
[242:29.40]I don't like you without your tail.
[242:31.95]I'm gonna do it again.
[242:32.51]I'm gonna do it again to do it.
[242:34.77]Thank you.
[242:35.91]Honest to God, what the fuck?
[242:39.12]I'm gonna lose this buff.
[242:46.42]Almost there.
[242:58.49]Almost time to activate it.
[243:00.75]Almost.
[243:03.06]Time to activate it.
[243:04.78]I'm gonna go right now.
[243:12.30]Got it.
[243:17.64]Got it.
[243:17.80]Okay, back it up.
[243:18.58]Don't fuck it up here.
[243:21.74]Oh, fuck.
[243:25.45]Thank god he did that.
[243:27.07]Because I probably would have, like, died.
[243:30.47]Coming back.
[243:33.38]Hey!
[243:34.96]How are ya?
[243:37.96]Good to see ya.
[243:43.25]Now if you would please move this way.
[243:54.82]Ugh.
[244:01.80]What are you doing?
[244:11.62]Coward.
[244:14.08]I lost the buff.
[244:14.94]Oh well.
[244:23.20]Oh well, I can get it back.
[244:34.62]Do it!
[244:35.61]He's got to be close, right?
[244:37.95]Shit!
[244:42.19]Oh, right when he flips over on his fucking SPAC, too.
[244:51.86]Got him.
[244:52.70]See you later.
[244:54.18]Hey, he's dead.
[244:56.18]Oh, he's not.
[244:57.62]What the fuck is going on here?
[245:00.66]Guys?
[245:01.46]Guys, what happened?
[245:03.14]What's happening?
[245:03.62]Where you going?
[245:04.06]What's going on?
[245:04.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[245:07.45]Hey!
[245:09.87]You get the fuck back here!
[245:11.45]I wanna, like, skin him and pick up his shit.
[245:16.41]Huh?
[245:19.47]What the fuck is going on?
[245:21.71]Is he supposed to do that?
[245:33.10]Oh, repel him.
[245:34.02]Well, at least I got the tail.
[245:43.54]It's a story thing.
[245:44.32]Oh, okay.
[245:45.10]Well, that's cool.
[245:49.42]He's a reoccurring bad guy.
[245:50.76]What is he, like, Dr. Robotnik?
[245:52.20]Is he gonna be in, like, a sphere next time I see him?
[245:55.24]Throwing shitty bombs at me?
[246:02.63]He was cool.
[246:09.73]Nice.
[246:16.82]Rip, Cha-Cha.
[246:18.24]Did he die?
[246:31.25]Meta Ligarius.
[246:37.08]You're not allowed to leave until you kill him in like 10 gameplay hours.
[246:49.11]Alright.
[246:52.11]Let me just... Let's go save it.
[246:56.32]And thank you to Anthron Gaming for three months.
[246:59.30]Sorry this will be my last month in a while, Jerma.
[247:01.78]Going through a breakup with a woman I've been with for over nine years now.
[247:06.30]I can't thank you enough for everything you do to try to make us happy.
[247:09.38]Thank you so much for everything.
[247:10.38]Well, dude, that's a very long relationship to be in.
[247:14.54]Nine years, man.
[247:16.96]Keep your head up.
[247:18.62]But don't worry.
[247:19.56]Don't worry about me.
[247:20.78]Worry about yourself.
[247:21.93]Take care of yourself, man.
[247:27.81]But thank you for the three months.
[247:31.93]Duoli8 subscribed for two months.
[247:34.49]Thanks a lot, man.
[247:35.23]MontyTheMoose for four months.
[247:42.13]And GroDev gave $5 15 minutes ago.
[247:45.97]It said acid base.
[247:47.57]Too late for that.
[247:49.23]But thanks for the $5.
[247:53.05]If I say Ligarius instead of Ligiacrus one more time, I'm going to shit my pants.
[247:59.06]There's an extra C in there.
[248:00.02]I don't want to say it.
[248:02.44]Right?
[248:02.84]Like... Legiacrus.
[248:04.86]Legiacrus.
[248:06.22]No, Legarius.
[248:07.60]Get that C out of there.
[248:08.52]Who wants a C when you're saying a word like that?
[248:13.48]Thanks.
[248:16.06]Am I going to be streaming tomorrow at all?
[248:17.54]No, I am not.
[248:24.48]Yeah, Anthron, I mean, if you...
[248:29.20]There's lots of people that are hanging around.
[248:33.32]I mean, there's a lot of people in my Discord.
[248:34.76]That's a great place to hang out and just talk.
[248:39.41]There's a lot of people in this community that would be more than happy, I think, to talk to you and help you out.
[248:46.19]But, good luck to you, man.
[248:50.09]I think I added an N in your name.
[248:51.29]It's Afron Gaming.
[248:52.57]Sorry.
[248:55.30]Um...
[248:57.80]$5 from Dr. Jensen.
[248:58.46]I have to shit my pants now.
[248:59.68]Thanks.
[249:03.90]And that's going to be it.
[249:06.22]That's going to be the end of the stream.
[249:09.26]I wanted to go long today just because I'm trying to make up for the fact that I streamed every day for the last four days in a row, I think, right?
[249:15.34]Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[249:16.68]Yeah, I've gone for like four days in a row.
[249:19.27]I wanted to make sure I did some, like, longer streams because this last week I was having a lot of internet problems and I couldn't really stream on Thursday and Friday.
[249:28.95]So.
[249:30.98]With that, thank you for watching.
[249:32.64]I'm not done with this game.
[249:35.34]But it's gonna go on the back burner for a week, I would say.
[249:40.08]Because Resident Evil 7 is Tuesday.
[249:46.22]And I'm doing that in VR.
[249:48.52]So Tuesday is going to be insane.
[249:50.28]It's going to be a crazy stream.
[249:53.76]I suggest you don't miss it if you want to see me shit my pants on camera with a VR helmet on.
[249:59.24]And then I think like For Honor is going into beta this next week too or something.
[250:05.42]I didn't stream yesterday?
[250:06.33]Oh no, I'm an idiot then.
[250:13.31]So, I will go back to Monster Hunter probably after next week.
[250:17.73]Depends on how long I play Resident Evil 7.
[250:21.32]And how long I play For Honor.
[250:22.70]But this is a game that I'm more than happy to go back to.
[250:25.96]I've just barely scratched the surface of what I like about it.
[250:28.74]So, I'm not against going back to playing it again.
[250:35.68]And with that, thank you all so much for hanging out.
[250:41.21]Yeah, Resident Evil 7 comes out on Tuesday, the 24th.
[250:47.96]It is coming out very soon.
[250:52.42]So thanks, everybody, for sticking around.
[250:53.75]If you were here for the whole day, I stopped my stream after a few hours earlier, but that's because I wanted to change an audio delay issue.
[251:03.97]Take care, everybody.
[251:04.77]See you soon.
[251:06.51]If you don't hear from me this weekend, if I don't decide to stream this weekend on an off schedule for some reason, then prepare for Resident Evil 7 on Tuesday.
[251:15.22]Should be a lot of fun.
[251:17.28]Good night.
[251:17.62]Good luck.
[251:18.44]Take care, everybody.
[251:19.62]See you later.
[252:05.45]Thank you.
