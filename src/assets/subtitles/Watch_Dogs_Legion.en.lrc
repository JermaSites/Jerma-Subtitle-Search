[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.08]What's up?
[00:01.58]What's up?
[00:02.10]What's up?
[00:02.64]What's up?
[00:04.89]Wow.
[00:05.45]Jerma985 is playing my favorite game.
[00:07.53]Watch Dogs Allegiance.
[00:09.47]I can't believe it's out now.
[00:10.93]It's only $59.99.
[00:11.29]$99.99.
[00:11.39]Or $119.
[00:11.57]Why was there... What's $119?
[00:12.25]I don't understand.
[00:12.95]Is this a $120 addition to this game?
[00:28.95]What do you get?
[00:29.45]Hold on.
[00:30.89]I gotta move my mic.
[00:31.69]It's low from the auto stream.
[00:50.15]What do you get with the $120 edition?
[00:51.67]A fucking little figurine that's made out of plywood?
[00:56.13]What do you get?
[00:56.53]Tell me.
[00:59.74]Remember, your 1080 is not going to be powerful enough.
[01:03.28]No, it is.
[01:04.46]I'm good.
[01:05.80]I can turn the graphics down if I have to.
[01:09.46]It's for skins?
[01:11.47]No, I'm going to be fine.
[01:18.81]1080 is fine.
[01:19.25]Yeah, it's fine.
[01:21.75]We had 10 community subs from Aggression Cow.
[01:24.99]Thank you, Aggression Cow.
[01:26.91]For the 10 community subs.
[01:31.17]1080 Andy.
[01:34.07]That's me.
[01:35.61]I just used the 1080.
[01:37.79]That's what I do.
[01:43.41]Make sure you're on DX11.
[01:46.13]I just opened the game.
[01:47.27]I don't think I even have DX12.
[01:50.24]I think I'm going to be fine.
[01:55.30]So yeah, this is Watch Dogs Legion.
[01:59.39]I know it's shocking.
[02:00.55]I know a lot of you guys are just choking on your grapes or whatever you're eating right now.
[02:06.63]Yes, I'm playing a game that came out today.
[02:11.63]A new game that came out today.
[02:14.81]Weird.
[02:16.03]That shit don't happen.
[02:18.39]Why am I playing this?
[02:20.44]Well, go over the German 985 checklist, please.
[02:26.34]Okay.
[02:27.89]Hunch people on sidewalk.
[02:29.99]That's a box that's checked.
[02:31.56]Drive a car.
[02:32.84]That's a box that's checked.
[02:35.53]Open world.
[02:36.45]That's a box that's checked.
[02:39.76]And I can play as old people.
[02:42.06]That's a bonus secret menu.
[02:43.98]That you didn't even know about.
[02:45.26]That box is now checked.
[02:46.58]And I know.
[02:47.28]Look.
[02:47.70]I'm already going to give you my impression of this game.
[02:49.10]I haven't even played it.
[02:50.56]But I feel like this is just going to be.
[02:53.02]When I used to play GTA 4.
[02:55.63]With the pedestrian mod.
[02:56.97]That you could play as any pedestrian.
[02:58.31]I feel like it's going to be the same game.
[03:05.71]I'm going in with an open mind though.
[03:12.37]He's going through his daily checklist.
[03:14.61]It's just a shitty version of that.
[03:16.30]No, it's the GTA 4 pedestrian mod.
[03:19.52]But somebody modded in phones.
[03:23.20]Like hacking phones.
[03:25.62]And it looks beautiful on a GTX 1080, I'll tell you.
[03:35.80]That's a sponsor.
[03:37.70]It's not a sponsor.
[03:38.52]Alright, let's just go.
[03:40.06]I'm gonna stall.
[03:42.02]I don't have to put a VR headset on.
[03:43.30]We can just go.
[03:45.51]There's also something interesting this game has.
[03:49.03]Which, why don't we take a look.
[03:52.39]This game has permadeath.
[03:53.83]And I'm assuming that you can have a bunch of people that are playing in your group.
[04:00.38]And if they die, they're dead forever.
[04:04.92]I'm gonna put, I'm, why not?
[04:11.07]My justification of playing on normal is to have permadeath on.
[04:16.85]Am I playing on hard?
[04:18.11]No, we're playing normal with permadeath.
[04:19.55]That's your, that's the compromise here.
[04:23.92]Please play the game, Mr. Streamer Man.
[04:25.80]I am.
[04:29.94]Are you ready?
[04:32.64]Are you guys ready for Watch Dogs Legion?
[04:39.17]Is it going to be a 10 minute stream?
[04:40.63]What, you think I'm going to not like the game that much?
[04:45.87]What do I look like?
[04:46.41]I sound like I look loud.
[04:48.69]Am I really loud?
[04:52.03]I look very loud.
[04:54.77]No, I look loud.
[04:56.23]All right, let's go.
[05:04.16]Do you want to start the game with these settings?
[05:05.22]Permadeath is on.
[05:06.18]Permadeath mode can be turned off in the options.
[05:09.42]Yeah, I'm good.
[05:10.14]Let's go.
[05:12.98]Hacking.
[05:13.60]Computers.
[05:15.26]Files.
[05:17.59]I'm checking.
[05:17.95]I'm checking on it.
[05:18.47]I'm checking on it.
[05:19.19]Yeah, just give me a minute.
[05:20.15]I'm checking on it.
[05:20.67]Yeah, what these people don't know is it takes like three months to hack into like some bank account.
[05:26.99]Oh, you want to get into bank account?
[05:28.25]Yeah, let me check on that right now.
[05:30.02]I got it.
[05:32.76]and pre-recorded hacking sequences.
[05:46.48]pub serving up a pint and a smile all that music lattes art and multiculturalism and the world's oldest underground the tube the class of cities really top shelf stuff play raving rabbits build it up and one night to tear it all down wait did it say it was 12 london's 12 000 years old how's that possible when the earth is only like 3 000 years old what what are you talking what do you mean
[06:29.27]A light bulb just went like, and broke in my head.
[06:33.46]Wait, what?
[06:35.42]Ow.
[06:36.10]Thoughts.
[06:37.52]Ow.
[06:38.00]Critical thinking hurts.
[06:39.28]Is that me?
[06:39.62]Yes, ma'am.
[06:54.94]Oh, cool.
[06:55.58]All right.
[06:56.02]Ubisoft presents.
[06:57.98]Not Raving Ravids.
[07:00.29]Resident Sleeper.
[07:01.19]I'm in.
[07:01.41]I'm in.
[07:02.85]I told you.
[07:03.23]I'm in.
[07:04.71]Me too.
[07:06.51]If you haven't rushed off, I might.
[07:08.17]Ever consider leaving these security threats to the authorities?
[07:11.32]That's rich, Bagley.
[07:13.00]The government would sooner arrest us for trying to help than actually do something useful.
[07:16.90]Got this one on our own.
[07:18.62]Carefully, Dalton.
[07:20.30]Bagley, are you detecting a little worry in Sabine's voice?
[07:22.98]Brilliant.
[07:23.54]Asking the computer about feelings.
[07:25.44]This explains so much.
[07:27.12]Shut it, you two, and get to work.
[07:29.96]There she is.
[07:32.56]This game is going to suck.
[07:33.90]Well, you can't say that yet.
[07:35.10]We haven't even walked around.
[07:36.33]Let's check that 1080.
[07:39.79]Okay.
[07:40.35]Hey.
[07:41.83]Guys, 1080 seems to be holding up pretty well.
[07:45.69]See the crouch.
[07:48.15]Okay.
[07:49.47]Press F near an unaware enemy to perform a takedown.
[07:53.82]If I hit Q, I vibrate his phone, and I can punch him right in the fucking face.
[08:01.29]Nice.
[08:01.55]That hurt you more than it hurt me.
[08:03.75]No, it definitely hurt your hand.
[08:04.69]Your hand probably broke in four places.
[08:06.88]I hate that bullshit.
[08:07.76]It's so stupid.
[08:08.30]If you punch somebody in the face, your hand breaks.
[08:11.56]Why didn't I cut to this guy in a fucking hospital bed for a week?
[08:16.68]Investigate the threat to Parliament.
[08:21.50]That's a weak hand.
[08:22.52]Weak bones?
[08:25.38]Alright, Operation Westminster.
[08:34.35]Okay, that's a vault.
[08:40.81]Is there like a hitman thing where I can see through walls?
[08:43.90]Isn't it permadeath on?
[08:45.14]Alright, what, if I die with the main characters, does the game just end?
[08:52.34]Detective vision.
[08:54.84]Wait, sneak.
[08:56.26]Hold on a locked door to reveal the link to the closed circuit terminal to unlock the door.
[09:02.02]Alright, be careful.
[09:02.56]There's people over here.
[09:06.50]Okay.
[09:07.84]Oh, just like in Half-Life.
[09:11.10]Use to hijack camera and scout the area.
[09:15.54]Hijack.
[09:16.72]Nice.
[09:17.04]Nice.
[09:18.64]Cool.
[09:19.50]Press Q when aiming at an explosive device to use the arm trap hack.
[09:23.96]Okay, that's been armed.
[09:29.91]What is it?
[09:33.49]Oh, no.
[09:33.83]Arm this one.
[09:34.45]Wait, what?
[09:37.35]It didn't say explode.
[09:38.49]It just said arm.
[09:41.43]It's really cool to see that they still think this mechanic is cool like eight years later.
[09:48.31]Okay, uh, let's go.
[09:56.76]Wait, is this- No, don't walk over there, that's gonna explode if I go over there.
[09:59.52]It's permadeath, I can't die.
[10:00.64]Alright, sneak.
[10:07.09]Wait, arm trap!
[10:09.31]So now when he walks into that, he's gonna explode.
[10:12.77]Is he?
[10:16.57]Why is all this stuff so dangerous?
[10:21.97]Does it make... Why?
[10:25.65]Why is every single thing we have surrounding us able to explode?
[10:34.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:35.30]There's two people here.
[10:36.26]Alright, arm this.
[10:37.24]Hey, guys, watch this.
[10:38.80]I'm a hacker.
[10:39.64]I'm gonna make the soda machine explode when the guy walks towards it.
[10:44.89]Hang on.
[10:52.58]I'm in.
[10:56.98]What are you doing?
[10:58.74]DedSec as fuck.
[11:04.35]Alright, turn off the power.
[11:05.45]What happened?
[11:05.89]Oh.
[11:20.84]Alright, they think... Oh, by the way, one really important thing about this story.
[11:25.06]I don't care.
[11:25.60]I never did care.
[11:27.34]I don't give a shit about anything they're talking about.
[11:29.04]I played an hour of Watch Dogs 1 and like two hours of Watch Dogs 2.
[11:32.52]I don't care about anything they're saying.
[11:33.58]I have no idea what's happening.
[11:36.00]Is that bad that I just played for like three hours total?
[11:42.74]Is that bad?
[11:43.18]Does it matter?
[11:47.44]Oh, wait.
[11:47.80]It's okay.
[11:48.26]I'll get a TLDR.
[11:49.22]What happens?
[11:55.14]I only played Watch Dogs enough to like drive over somebody on the sidewalk, hack a traffic light, and have a car crash happen, and then I went, meh, and I stopped playing.
[12:06.36]Distract.
[12:06.76]Wait.
[12:07.44]Is there a... This?
[12:08.10]It covered near a wall.
[12:10.35]I got one right here.
[12:25.25]AI doesn't swear.
[12:27.51]Why would you program AI to swear?
[12:32.07]Alright, we gotta reach the House of Commons.
[12:36.83]I'm just gonna walk around.
[12:41.06]Oh, fuck.
[12:41.48]What do I do?
[12:43.32]I gotta distract this guy.
[12:44.24]Alright, distract.
[12:46.72]What?
[12:49.18]I don't have enough power to hack?
[12:52.65]I get... Okay, I have enough power to go into a webcam and look at somebody, but not enough to hack their phone.
[12:59.83]Alright, I get it.
[13:00.49]Let's just walk.
[13:01.00]Who cares?
[13:02.18]You're out of hacking mana.
[13:05.76]The AI is probably stupid.
[13:07.42]Do I do... It's stupid!
[13:09.91]Look!
[13:16.30]I'm good.
[13:16.50]This guy's chasing me like a baton.
[13:17.62]Unavailable while under pursuit?
[13:18.54]What?
[13:18.70]I'm good.
[13:19.74]I'm just hiding in the trash.
[13:20.66]They can't see me.
[13:21.40]Unavailable while... Where's my...
[13:49.25]Alright, so go.
[13:52.45]Move on.
[13:52.81]Yeah, I know.
[13:56.10]The 100-foot radius in a circle around you is clear.
[13:59.54]You might want to check somewhere else.
[14:03.64]Oh, no.
[14:04.04]I know what they're doing.
[14:06.24]They will... Oh!
[14:07.02]Oh!
[14:08.94]Okay, I know I'm good.
[14:10.14]Sorry, I just screamed.
[14:11.86]They were just pretending to check and going over the microphone and over the radio.
[14:15.82]Like, tell the supervisor, like, yeah, it was just make-believe.
[14:22.83]Oh, what do I do?
[14:23.49]Looks like I'm gonna have to hack into this.
[14:27.15]Oh, come on, what?
[14:27.75]What do you mean about hacking?
[14:31.68]Why can't I hack the door?
[14:43.02]This guy dies in, like, five minutes.
[14:49.08]I get it.
[14:49.96]I know, I know.
[14:50.88]I'm gonna die in, like, two minutes.
[14:52.48]And that's when it's like, oh, you think this is the main character.
[14:55.25]Would've been, like, kind of a cool reveal if they just didn't spend the last, like, full year talking about how cool it was to play as every character in the world.
[15:01.37]Alright, reach the detonator.
[15:13.29]Alright, well that was unnecessary, but it's okay.
[15:14.67]Is this a mini-game?
[15:20.21]What do I have to do?
[15:22.19]Oh, it's a cutscene, okay.
[15:23.01]Bagley?
[15:23.25]Wait, his name is Bagley.
[15:26.28]You're full of surprises.
[15:42.96]Be quick about it.
[15:43.70]Isn't that, like, hidden portal?
[15:49.53]I'm in.
[15:50.69]Oh, yeah, me too.
[15:51.87]The bombs have just armed themselves.
[15:54.03]Well, that may complicate matters.
[15:55.85]All right, hey, those of you that are playing the drinking game, that's three times.
[16:00.23]Another failsafe and vaporizing, so fair warning.
[16:03.03]Expect this to draw some attention your way, Dalton.
[16:06.71]Oh, I'm counted on it.
[16:09.32]Company at our back door.
[16:12.69]Dalton, we've got some heat here.
[16:14.03]Remember why?
[16:14.62]What?
[16:14.72]How long is this going to take, Bagley?
[16:16.46]Depends how often you interrupt me with questions.
[16:19.66]All right, everyone.
[16:21.04]Face is on, guns out.
[16:22.66]Face is on.
[16:23.40]Oh, I can't wait to put... I'm going to pick my favorite mask, right?
[16:26.48]I can pick a mask.
[16:28.16]Fuck.
[16:33.96]No, no, no!
[16:35.94]You're not supposed to save me!
[16:37.40]You're supposed to save her!
[16:40.56]They're on me.
[16:41.04]I'll try and hold them off.
[16:50.10]Okay, survive the ambush.
[16:55.13]Oh, shit.
[16:57.07]Oh, sorry.
[16:57.79]Am I supposed to kill these guys?
[16:59.99]Did I crash?
[17:20.89]Okay, so I have to... What do I do?
[17:26.87]Okay, um... It's still on.
[17:31.78]This is slow-mo effect?
[17:36.26]Well, this is a really long slow-mo.
[17:38.52]Turn off the computer?
[17:41.36]I have to do this.
[17:44.51]This sucks.
[17:47.15]Why?
[17:47.51]What the hell happened?
[17:51.60]Press control, alt, delete.
[17:59.76]I love it.
[18:05.54]I'm in.
[18:10.55]Oh, I got booted.
[18:11.27]I got booted.
[18:16.37]I can't believe I have to control.
[18:17.41]I have to hard reset this.
[18:19.83]Watch Dogs Legion.
[18:20.91]End task.
[18:22.63]Give me a fucking break.
[18:27.92]Where's that going to pop up?
[18:30.98]What's that going to do?
[18:35.12]Watch Dogs Legion.
[18:36.08]Alright, let's go.
[18:36.64]That better be an autosave right there.
[18:46.70]This is so stupid.
[18:49.59]Oh well.
[18:50.45]Now I can't even open the game.
[18:51.53]Is it opening?
[18:55.05]Hello?
[19:02.63]It says the game is running.
[19:03.97]I ended the task.
[19:13.10]You just got bogged.
[19:16.80]What is going on?
[19:17.78]Open!
[19:18.16]Ten minute stream?
[19:25.50]No, no, it's opening.
[19:26.94]It's just taking a wicked long time.
[19:28.60]I have all the new drivers, I need a new computer.
[19:34.27]I can't like pretend to play these new AAA games.
[19:42.01]Alright, it only took two minutes to open.
[19:45.39]This is what it felt like when you used to have a regular HDD.
[19:48.87]And you'd turn on Windows and it would take like seven minutes before you got to your desktop.
[19:53.77]Fuck, I need a new computer.
[19:54.69]Alright, here we go.
[20:01.75]Big bits?
[20:02.25]Oh shit, there are big bits.
[20:06.15]Alright, this is from Tapeworm Corndog.
[20:08.41]Holy shit, that's disgusting.
[20:10.47]Thanks for the- That's a hundred bucks.
[20:16.42]10,000 bits from Tapeworm Corndog, and they say... Thanks for fucking showing everybody my cool username.
[20:22.59]Actually, that's not even my username.
[20:23.67]My username is RoyaleComingMyWay.
[20:26.17]Oh, no, wait.
[20:31.85]Uh, anyways, they say, Hi Jerma, love you in chat.
[20:33.96]Been watching for like eight years, and today's my 19th birthday.
[20:36.60]Happy fucking birthday.
[20:37.94]Wanted to give a little back and say thanks for being the master of comedy.
[20:41.12]I won't be here for long because I exclusively watch VODs.
[20:45.21]Alright.
[20:45.73]Also, can we get some German disgusts for my username?
[20:48.25]Yeah, I gave you a huge one.
[20:55.69]Oh, fuck.
[20:57.39]I completely just blew my cover here.
[21:01.02]I turned it on for a minute to make sure that the 1080 could handle it.
[21:08.48]And here we are.
[21:09.10]No, seriously, tapeworm.
[21:10.70]That's a ton of money.
[21:12.48]Thanks for the fucking hundred bucks.
[21:18.54]It still couldn't handle it.
[21:20.22]I swear to God, if it crashes again, I'm gonna be very upset.
[21:25.04]But the game didn't even crash.
[21:28.82]We still get an audio.
[21:32.34]Oh, lower the s- Alright, I'm gonna lower the settings.
[21:33.78]That's a good- That's not a bad idea.
[21:35.24]Lower the graphics settings.
[21:38.60]Oh, great.
[21:39.00]And I get to be the last person that loads up in League.
[21:43.76]Everyone has to sit there and fucking watch.
[21:48.34]Like, holy shit.
[21:49.56]Oh my god, don't even fucking tell me.
[21:59.09]God damn it.
[21:59.99]Alright, hold on.
[22:00.83]Turn the graphics down.
[22:02.21]Video.
[22:03.85]Alright.
[22:05.25]FPS limit.
[22:06.30]Field of view.
[22:07.06]I can't turn that up.
[22:08.94]Quality.
[22:10.06]Alright.
[22:11.26]Graphics quality, high.
[22:13.08]Geometry, high.
[22:14.14]Environment, high.
[22:14.76]Textures, medium.
[22:16.52]Filtering.
[22:17.66]You can't even tell a difference, okay?
[22:19.24]Look it.
[22:20.97]This is like going to the eye doctor.
[22:24.75]And you have no idea which one looks better.
[22:26.73]It doesn't even matter.
[22:28.19]Low.
[22:29.89]Shadows.
[22:31.80]Okay.
[22:32.66]These actually look better.
[22:33.56]No, they don't.
[22:33.98]Those look terrible.
[22:34.84]It looks like there's a giant spider web over New York.
[22:40.09]Oh, London.
[22:40.57]Wherever we are.
[22:42.95]Headlight shadow.
[22:43.71]Reflections.
[22:46.67]Somebody point out the difference.
[22:47.81]Just turn them off.
[22:51.94]Who cares?
[22:53.98]Motion blur.
[22:54.52]Get out of here.
[22:55.06]Depth of field.
[22:55.70]Get out of here.
[22:57.26]Ambient occlusion.
[22:58.26]Nobody wants that.
[22:59.14]Everyone turns it off.
[22:59.90]That's the first thing everybody does when they open up any video game.
[23:01.89]They turn this off.
[23:05.19]Subsurface scattering.
[23:10.06]I feel like this is just a made up word.
[23:11.72]That they can just have a toggle here.
[23:13.37]What is it doing?
[23:14.75]It's scattering the subsurface?
[23:18.05]It looks alright.
[23:18.43]I guess it looks okay.
[23:20.25]Ray traced.
[23:20.95]I don't have that.
[23:21.67]I can't do that.
[23:24.23]Temporal upscaling.
[23:25.52]Alright.
[23:27.02]I'm good.
[23:27.88]Let's go.
[23:41.33]Dude, you know, playing a game at launch, launch bugs, launch problems, it's okay.
[23:47.63]Whatever, man.
[23:48.25]This is what happens.
[23:50.31]Playing it at launch.
[23:53.61]By the way, it is refreshing.
[23:55.16]It's just taking a while.
[24:01.36]Veto it?
[24:01.92]No, I can't.
[24:02.62]Are we serious?
[24:03.44]No, not yet.
[24:05.04]I'll play 3DS.
[24:06.02]I'm not playing 3DS.
[24:07.06]I have to play one AAA game a year.
[24:08.75]I'm allowed to.
[24:14.08]Okay, here we go.
[24:16.32]I'm in.
[24:19.16]Veto.
[24:19.54]I'm not vetoing.
[24:20.18]Let's go.
[24:21.62]We're here.
[24:22.90]I've lowered the graphics.
[24:24.35]I'm just going to speedrun this part.
[24:26.69]I'm just going to run through this part because I don't care.
[24:30.97]You're not vetoing.
[24:31.75]We are.
[24:33.01]Yeah, but don't you understand?
[24:33.89]I have the voting power of a million of you.
[24:39.11]I just say, we're going, and that's what we do.
[24:43.80]That's a dictator.
[24:44.60]I mean... Aren't all streams, like, dictatorships?
[24:58.01]No.
[24:58.45]Yes.
[25:00.05]You're a tyrant.
[25:03.04]Okay, here we go.
[25:05.98]Welcome to Watch Dogs.
[25:08.18]I'm your host, Jerma.
[25:13.05]Thank you to Ubisoft for making such a cool game.
[25:14.75]And thank you.
[25:16.47]Big thanks.
[25:17.73]Thank you.
[25:27.44]Well, no, no, this is not sponsored.
[25:28.88]I just said thank you for making a cool game.
[25:33.31]Go.
[25:37.49]Alright, I'm in.
[25:38.59]I'm in.
[25:39.17]I'm in.
[25:39.67]I'm in.
[25:40.47]Let's go.
[25:40.83]For real, I'm in.
[25:41.94]It's time to move.
[25:43.26]Go.
[25:43.80]Speedrun.
[25:45.96]I'm not stopping for anything.
[25:49.78]Wait.
[25:51.54]Why did I just Medusa that guy?
[25:53.02]What happened?
[25:53.76]I just spit in that guy's face.
[25:54.90]Let's go.
[26:09.71]Oh, look.
[26:10.39]I don't know.
[26:10.81]What do I do?
[26:21.26]I feel like I should have had a football in my hand.
[26:26.18]What the fuck was that?
[26:27.22]Metal Gear Solid bullshit.
[26:29.46]Good.
[26:41.00]Turn it on.
[26:41.36]I don't care.
[26:41.66]Leave me alone.
[26:41.98]Disrupt!
[26:42.18]Alright, we're good.
[26:42.84]We're on pace.
[27:13.38]Okay.
[27:15.52]Oh, fuck me.
[27:16.33]The entire place is rigged to blow.
[27:19.39]Jesus.
[27:19.69]Those canisters.
[27:22.07]Bagley, is that... RDX nitrogen.
[27:24.53]Enough to level Parliament.
[27:26.01]Analyze.
[27:26.42]Can you locate a detonator?
[27:27.54]Wait, I didn't do this last time.
[27:28.38]Let me do this first.
[27:28.86]Not exactly, but there's a device streaming a fuckload of encrypted data from the floor above you.
[27:33.00]Fuck.
[27:33.26]Yeah, that fits the bill.
[27:34.62]On my way.
[27:35.38]Bagley, is that not the detonator?
[27:37.48]No, but it's a transmitter sending a signal to a device on the floor above us.
[27:41.16]Safe to assume that would be the detonator we're looking for.
[27:43.86]I've staged dead set propaganda all around the bombs.
[27:50.53]This is not how you're supposed to play this game.
[27:54.33]Not if you get to that detonator first.
[27:56.29]Did you see me?
[28:02.33]What?
[28:02.61]No, him!
[28:09.06]Okay, we're good.
[28:11.88]I did it.
[28:12.20]It only took me three seconds.
[28:21.86]He should have tried to open it, picked up his phone, held it over to it, and it didn't work, and he should have looked right at the camera and gone like, oh, man.
[28:30.58]Yep.
[28:31.72]Okay, here we go.
[28:37.36]Save the game.
[28:40.19]I can't.
[28:40.71]It's just, it's permanently auto-saving.
[28:44.19]Alright, I'm gonna arm a trap.
[28:45.54]Let's make sure this doesn't hurt us.
[28:47.20]Okay, arm trap.
[28:50.16]Interact.
[28:50.58]Here we go.
[28:51.18]It's time to shoot.
[28:52.08]Headshot.
[28:52.80]I'm not gonna shoot the guy the same way.
[28:59.85]Alright, here we go.
[29:00.59]Ready?
[29:02.57]Fight your way out.
[29:03.33]Look who it is!
[29:12.38]Let's go!
[29:13.76]Why is this guy screaming?
[29:17.02]We're good.
[29:17.74]That's three.
[29:19.34]That's three.
[29:19.74]Three.
[29:19.94]Oh.
[29:20.02]X. Oh, you can...
[29:42.06]Oh, look at this.
[29:56.49]53%.
[29:57.33]Flashbang.
[30:03.68]Flashbang.
[30:04.24]How do I throw a flash?
[30:05.16]Oh, it's a recharge.
[30:07.84]Why do I feel like I'm playing Left 4 Dead right now?
[30:10.42]This is Payday.
[30:20.92]Get on.
[30:22.50]Get on?
[30:23.20]What?
[30:23.36]No crash, we're good.
[30:24.16]Deactivate.
[30:24.50]Sick.
[30:24.66]Are you fucking kidding me?
[30:25.44]No, fucking.
[30:25.74]Fuck.
[30:25.88]Which one is this?
[30:30.58]Fuck.
[30:30.72]Now don't, Dalton, don't, fuck, don't pull that one.
[30:56.32]Oh fuck.
[31:02.48]Why'd they all mask up?
[31:03.44]They didn't even go anywhere.
[31:04.62]What was that for?
[31:07.54]Everybody mask up!
[31:09.42]We're just gonna stay here.
[31:11.98]It appears Parliament is not the only target.
[31:14.92]More bombs are going live as we speak.
[31:19.58]Do I go get a bomb?
[31:20.28]Shut the hell down.
[31:45.49]It was a mole.
[31:48.59]Fuck.
[31:52.29]It was a mole.
[31:53.55]It was probably me.
[31:56.12]To the roof.
[31:58.36]Wait, pick up ammo?
[32:01.54]Sabine, what's going on?
[32:03.20]We're being raided.
[32:04.54]It's a bloodbath.
[32:05.48]We're being raided?
[32:06.08]Oh, well, Sabine, sing the raid song.
[32:10.38]I need him for the transmitter.
[32:15.66]Press V to scan the area and reveal cameras to hack.
[32:19.64]Okay.
[32:20.38]I'll do it the old-fashioned way.
[32:22.17]Hack him.
[32:23.27]Yes, wipe me.
[32:24.67]Do it, Sabine, and get the hell out of there.
[32:26.55]Okay.
[32:26.67]Fuck.
[32:27.75]Hack.
[32:28.03]Download that.
[32:28.61]Whatever it is.
[32:31.55]Okay.
[32:32.49]Bag is down.
[32:33.88]You're on your own.
[32:36.06]Dalton, this goes.
[32:37.52]Hack whatever this is, too.
[32:38.68]What is this?
[32:39.84]What are we doing?
[32:40.26]I promise.
[32:41.60]I promise.
[32:43.50]Okay.
[32:44.69]Am I in somebody's iPad?
[32:45.91]Or did I get it?
[32:50.41]I got the code, right?
[32:52.15]Yeah, I downloaded the code.
[32:55.65]Hey!
[32:55.93]Hey!
[33:00.33]What happened?
[33:00.71]I didn't do anything.
[33:06.38]No, no, no!
[33:06.94]Get down!
[33:07.36]Alright, you stun him and then you shoot him in the head.
[33:14.52]Why is that person... That person's like... Super... What is it?
[33:18.70]What is it?
[33:19.14]Uh... Marshal?
[33:20.90]In World of Warcraft... Battleground?
[33:23.34]Arena thing?
[33:24.73]I tried.
[33:25.59]I forgot what it was.
[33:26.59]I'm sorry.
[33:27.93]Why can I not shoot him?
[33:35.31]Why is that guy so special?
[33:39.66]Why was that guy special?
[33:48.98]toxicity for encroaching 500%.
[33:52.97]Where are you?
[33:53.65]Come on, defuse.
[34:14.69]Why do all these bombs look like underneath your sink?
[34:17.17]Have you ever noticed that?
[34:28.51]Like plumbing in there.
[34:29.38]There's not even wires.
[34:30.64]Who is it?
[34:43.85]FIRE!
[34:44.09]FALL!
[34:44.23]GROANS!
[34:57.74]Did anybody else see this?
[35:00.32]Did anybody else see this big projection of like Obi-Wan talking?
[35:05.77]This is like the Emperor.
[35:06.53]This is like a 10 million decibel megawatt speaker.
[35:28.12]It's time for a hard reset, Ted.
[35:31.85]Oh, my God.
[35:33.61]No!
[35:33.77]I told you he was dead.
[35:45.53]A series of explosions devastated three sites in London.
[35:49.74]Authorities are asking residents to remain in their homes as the situation continues to develop.
[35:54.44]I loved that character.
[35:55.58]No official casualty total.
[35:57.57]Love that character.
[35:58.61]You didn't have a chance.
[36:22.00]I don't know what's going on.
[36:22.90]I probably should have played the first two games.
[36:25.96]Autonomous drones to capture the remaining members of DedSec.
[36:30.05]A stark warning to would-be insurgents.
[36:32.11]Top corporations are posting record profits due to increased efficiencies in production and distribution.
[36:39.21]That sounds like John Oliver.
[36:40.81]Oh, wait.
[36:41.77]No, it wouldn't be John Oliver.
[36:44.85]He didn't go, I don't think I say that, Mr. Turkle.
[36:47.43]I don't want you to do it.
[36:48.59]And I don't think that you're very smart.
[36:50.49]...all down following prosecutions of the leaders of four of London's five largest criminal syndicates.
[36:56.33]The streets of Camden and Brixton...
[37:00.19]As Albion's mandate is extended indefinitely by the government, life finally begins to return to normal.
[37:07.70]Curfews and travel restrictions have been lifted in all boroughs, thanks to the deployment... ...news outlets, reports of rioting in Trafalgar Square have been greatly exaggerated, possibly by foreign meddlers pushing a false narrative through social media.
[37:22.11]So where do we come in here?
[37:23.15]Wait, is DedSec bad?
[37:24.59]Or is DedSec good?
[37:25.29]...willing to expound those theories on camera.
[37:27.63]The facts simply do not support any other story.
[37:51.91]Pay attention.
[37:59.97]I'm falling for fake news?
[38:06.54]Wait, but the TV told me that DedSec was not very good.
[38:09.90]Oh shit, the fake news is working on me.
[38:21.38]Who am I?
[38:23.02]Am I the spider?
[38:23.72]Okay.
[38:25.62]Profile the spider block.
[38:26.50]Okay.
[38:26.70]Can you bite people?
[38:54.58]I thought they just said up there, blame the data center.
[38:57.00]Now what do we do?
[39:08.17]How do I shoot lasers?
[39:08.71]Oh.
[39:08.77]It's a friendly.
[39:09.11]I don't- I like- I like swallow the last word.
[39:37.17]I couldn't even go into the because I was swallowing.
[39:40.15]Spider!
[39:40.45]Oh, crypto!
[39:41.39]What am I doing?
[40:07.64]Fuck.
[40:07.80]Why is it doing that?
[40:09.20]Why is it just doing that?
[40:10.12]It crashed again.
[40:11.12]Why is it crashing?
[40:35.35]No, I haven't even been able to get into- I need to get into a car first.
[40:39.00]You don't veto an open world car game without driving the car first.
[40:46.28]What if I take down a little bit more of graphic quality?
[40:54.51]Put it on medium.
[40:57.61]You drove the car.
[40:58.65]That's not a car, that was an animal.
[41:04.45]Did you update your drivers?
[41:05.67]I did, like, a week ago.
[41:08.01]But is there, like, a Watch Dogs Legion launch drivers?
[41:12.13]There better not be.
[41:12.87]Oh, fuck.
[41:18.25]Come on, man.
[41:21.36]There always is.
[41:22.10]There better not be.
[41:23.64]I have a 1080.
[41:23.88]They don't even make drivers for me anymore.
[41:25.62]They don't care about me.
[41:28.76]They don't want to make drivers for me because they don't want me to have a... They want me to get the new one.
[41:37.54]Alright, if it crashes again, I'm gonna update my drivers.
[41:46.99]What does it say?
[41:48.81]The crashes that some players are experiencing are due to Windows problems?
[41:53.57]It's caused by outdated Windows.
[41:56.60]What?
[41:58.68]What would that have to fucking do with anything?
[42:07.21]Dude, is he still alive in this playthrough?
[42:08.77]He better not be.
[42:17.64]Windows user detected.
[42:26.20]Hold on.
[42:28.74]You see it?
[42:34.80]If I swear to God, if this guy... Play a silly game.
[42:38.44]What is silly game?
[42:39.30]What does that even mean?
[42:41.16]Silly game.
[42:43.70]This is a silly game.
[42:48.01]Crash is a dude.
[42:49.35]Guys, I did a full, fresh install of Windows 10.
[42:53.43]Like two weeks ago.
[42:54.73]Three weeks ago.
[42:55.57]This is all brand new operating system.
[42:57.83]As of like two weeks ago.
[42:59.83]All fresh, complete updates.
[43:01.66]I need to assemble a team, but I can't reboot DedSec alone.
[43:06.04]What's going on?
[43:06.92]Let me break into London CTOS and see who's available.
[43:10.57]Did I skip a whole thing?
[43:11.59]Oh, okay.
[43:16.05]Go, go, go, go, go.
[43:17.53]Alright, get in there.
[43:18.61]...alleged terrorist group, DedSec, on this week's Buccaneer Radio.
[43:22.57]I have Colin calling in.
[43:25.00]Colin, what's your take?
[43:26.78]Now, I'll be same to start.
[43:28.32]We should have ran up DedSec and thrown
[43:32.03]Lower your graphics settings again.
[43:33.64]I don't even want to listen to that.
[43:37.52]Like, I already know.
[43:38.30]I can't even, I can't, I can't hit escape.
[43:42.30]We have to do this first.
[43:47.45]Say the line.
[43:49.05]What, what would it be doing?
[43:50.63]Updated windows.
[43:57.71]Why do I feel like that's, like, weird corporate speak for, holy shit, let's get a day two patch out?
[44:04.61]Uh, there are windows, uh, maybe outdated, uh, I think.
[44:16.86]Uh, check to, uh, check to see if your monitor is, uh, plugged in.
[44:21.34]Get the patch, get the fucking patch ready by tomorrow, motherfucker, I swear to God.
[44:25.16]Check to see if your cable, if you plugged in your cable recently, like your power cable.
[44:35.28]Access the CTOS data clusters.
[44:41.08]Reinstall Windows again.
[44:47.21]What's the graphics card recommended graphics card for this?
[44:52.21]It's probably like a 780.
[44:59.63]10, 1070?
[45:04.71]Alright, sick.
[45:05.77]Hack it.
[45:08.63]I hacked, uh, I don't know.
[45:11.51]Is this a green goblin's tower?

[50:03.96]Wait, there's an auto drive?
[50:05.05]This looks like shit.
[50:22.42]This looks like Nintendo 64.
[50:29.97]Why does it look like Nintendo 64?
[50:31.47]Is this the wrong way?
[50:35.30]It don't matter.
[50:35.74]There's no police in this game, is there?
[51:01.07]Move!
[51:06.71]Watchdogs!
[51:09.17]They don't even care?

[51:36.36]What is happening?
[51:37.10]I'm supposed to follow the blue arrow, right?
[51:54.45]Wrong side of the road.
[51:55.89]Oh, that's right.
[51:56.63]We're in... We're not in America.
[52:01.67]Oh, that's gonna be horrible.

[52:20.17]I don't have a high enough hacker level?
[52:28.28]Oh, that's not cool.
[52:29.02]Alright, get out here.
[52:39.26]Alright, I made it.
[52:39.64]Oh, you can play dance?

[52:44.34]Complete the circuit to solve the puzzle.
[53:05.41]Rotate the... What is going on in 2020 with these fucking rotate puzzles?
[53:14.69]This is very, very, very, very, very much the exact same thing that we did in Alyx.
[53:19.13]Okay, you're gonna have to manual override it.
[53:25.21]To the painting.
[53:28.86]Alright, that's unlocked.
[53:30.90]That's unlocked.
[53:31.74]That's good.
[53:32.78]Now I have to go like this, unlock this one.
[53:36.49]Open that fucking door.
[53:46.36]Radiator.
[53:47.58]Open the radiator?
[53:51.49]Oh, this is our secret hideout!
[54:02.70]Oh, we're up the safe house.
[54:03.58]Right, because I'm the only operative ever that exists.
[54:06.70]It's just me.
[54:08.78]Alright, let's boot it back up.
[54:22.52]You drove the car, now you can stop playing.
[54:31.76]Oh, stop.
[54:33.50]My name is Nancy Schwab.
[54:37.54]I'm with Sabine.
[54:39.61]Who the hell do you think you are?
[54:43.67]Sabine's alive?
[54:44.85]Well, that's one piece of good news.
[54:46.93]I'm Bagley, DedSec's definitely not stolen highly advanced AI assistant, and it seems I've been out of commission for a few months.
[54:53.36]Anyway, why don't you go connect me to the DedSec network so I can become more powerful than you could possibly imagine?
[54:58.60]I mean, catch up on what I missed.
[55:00.73]Who says that?
[55:01.13]What cartoon character says that?
[55:03.23]What power that you could possibly imagine?
[55:12.36]What's this?
[55:13.22]That's how you make a 100-hour game, by the way.
[55:16.52]Not me.
[55:16.78]I'll be done in about 12 hours.
[55:18.24]Probably less than that.
[55:34.98]Alright, I activated Bagley's servers.
[55:36.98]What about the mask?
[55:37.58]Oh, there's a mask.
[55:38.46]Wait, loot?
[55:38.80]Wait, can I like drop loot?
[56:02.95]Doesn't Ubisoft do stuff like that?
[56:04.57]Can I like drop a box on the stream?
[56:06.37]Can I do that?
[56:06.83]Alright, let's contact Sabine.
[56:07.53]Mask.
[56:07.69]Oh, I got a pig mask.
[56:09.03]Where's my... Do I have an inventory?
[56:11.05]Where's inventory?
[56:37.38]It's Saw.
[56:42.47]Make some pig noises for that mask.
[56:44.23]Okay.
[56:46.51]This is for you.
[56:46.97]I don't even know who said that, but sure.
[56:56.42]God, it's good to hear your demented little voice.
[56:59.33]Is your memory intact?
[57:00.49]Not even slightly.
[57:01.53]The last record I have is of our HQ being raided.
[57:04.13]My only lead is a group known as Zero Day.
[57:06.59]Ring any bells?
[57:09.25]Worst noise.
[57:11.29]Don't blame me.
[57:12.18]Blame the person that told me to do that.
[57:13.64]That was pretty good though, wasn't it?
[57:17.64]They just gunned everyone down.
[57:19.50]My God.
[57:21.12]How'd you survive?
[57:23.24]I managed to escape through the sewers to Camden.
[57:25.26]That's pretty good.
[57:26.96]What's wrong with it?
[57:30.01]Your profile is read as a high-priority target in the city's surveillance system.
[57:33.87]Even a partial recognition hit would have you hunted down and shot on sight.
[57:37.79]There aren't many DedSec fans in London these days.
[57:41.37]Look, I want to help, I do, but joining up with you now verges on suicidal.
[57:46.43]Listen, if anyone knows anything about risks, it's me.
[57:49.74]I lost everything and everyone.
[57:52.70]But it comes down to this.
[57:55.36]London is in a death spiral.
[57:58.20]And if DedSec can't pull it out, trust me, no one can.
[58:02.29]Actually moving so much.
[58:03.55]Yeah, I mean, it is kind of like a puppeteer.
[58:07.83]It's like moving the head around every word to make sure you over enunciate everything.
[58:12.97]That's how puppeteers do it.
[58:14.91]I'm not going to skip this.
[58:23.31]Guys, I'm allowed to play one, like, 6 out of 10 AAA release a year, okay?
[58:27.99]Pick a better one.
[58:28.83]This just came out fucking two hours ago.
[58:30.25]It just released.
[58:31.05]I don't know.
[58:47.30]Tech points.
[58:48.00]Can be found throughout London.
[58:49.14]Use them to purchase tech upgrades.
[58:51.09]Gadgets and weapons.
[58:52.19]Cool.
[58:52.93]Equipping tech.
[58:54.57]To change an operative's weapon or gadget, use the edit function in the T menu.
[59:00.79]Nice.
[59:01.07]Spend tech points.
[59:04.80]Ooh!
[59:06.06]Tech points!
[59:07.86]What's this?
[59:09.60]I got 10 tech points.
[59:11.22]Chase drones can be hijacked.
[59:14.07]AR camouflage to render the wearer invisible and break line of sight.
[59:18.19]Cool.
[59:19.51]This is an LTL-68P DedSec pistol.
[59:26.11]These are like Team Fortress weapons.
[59:32.01]Oh, Infiltrator Spiderbot.
[59:34.37]A stealth-based spiderbot capable of performing non-lethal takedowns.
[59:39.35]Chat.
[59:40.27]Should we get that one, Chat?
[59:43.16]Yeah, sure.
[59:49.48]All right, data.
[59:50.36]Cool.
[59:50.48]All right.
[59:53.30]Edit operative.
[59:53.94]All right, you have a pistol.
[59:58.23]That works.
[59:59.55]You've got a nice car.
[60:00.57]And we're going to give you the spider robot.
[60:04.47]Where is this?
[60:05.23]The ultimate sports car, speedy and sleek.
[60:06.83]It will never be mistaken for another car.
[60:09.01]Oh, I can change the paint job.
[60:11.31]Is this Ubisoft box?
[60:12.92]This is not Ubisoft box, right?
[60:15.96]Is this Ubisoft box?
[60:26.26]Really?
[60:26.88]I can only buy gray and black?
[60:30.34]I can't do, like, blue?
[60:33.81]Whatever.
[60:36.35]It's in-game.
[60:37.03]Oh, okay.
[60:37.31]Hold on a second.
[60:37.91]Hold on.
[60:38.19]Hold on a minute.
[60:38.73]Hold on.
[60:39.03]Everyone relax.
[61:02.32]Yes, everybody relax.
[61:03.48]Alright, we don't have to shut the computer off.
[61:10.98]Alright, nice.
[61:18.34]Buy a new PC, you fucker.
[61:21.22]Look, all the new shit came out.
[61:22.82]Like the 3090s.
[61:24.43]The new AMD Risen shit.
[61:27.31]I gotta get those.
[61:28.69]What, you want me to buy?
[61:29.55]If I'm gonna buy a new computer, I wanna buy old hardware.
[61:32.73]I wanna get the new shit.
[61:34.41]It's gotta be available.
[61:39.21]Oh, this is too many UbiBucks.
[61:45.56]Uh, no, this is too many UbiBucks.

[62:37.41]No!
[62:37.49]I don't have... The 1080 is not even a bad graphics card.
[62:39.09]It's not even like four years old.
[62:40.77]Alright.
[62:41.09]Okay, I just... I think I just killed that person.
[62:42.31]What happened?

[63:25.98]Sock-em-boppers.
[63:29.70]Holy shit.
[63:30.64]Why are you hitting each other for real in the face?
[63:45.60]Just the haymakers.

[68:36.67]Alright, let's move.
[68:49.10]I want that, but no, it's like a pizza delivery thing.
[68:51.12]I don't want that.
[68:54.54]GTA 3.
[68:56.82]It's not very good.
[68:57.78]It isn't.
[68:59.08]But it's okay.

[69:58.59]Invisible man was just in the road and just grabbed me by the back of my collar.
[70:07.78]Who is?
[70:12.05]This person's doing graffiti.
[70:16.51]Well, bye.
[70:23.62]What the fuck are you doing?
[70:28.72]Why would you do that?
[70:30.71]What were you thinking?
[70:32.97]What are you doing?
[70:34.97]What a fucking idiot.
[70:40.71]Okay, let's go.
[70:51.22]I caved in that lady's chest.
[70:54.22]In case you forgot, the private key you're after is on a server in a van.
[70:57.88]Okay.
[71:01.18]Watchdogs.
[71:03.44]Why are you doing that?
[71:18.59]I need to take a second.
[71:21.27]Holy shit, people just walk in front of your car.
[71:23.93]Oh, it says play ball!
[71:27.74]Hit the inputs in time to hit the ball.
[71:32.38]What is this?
[71:34.43]According to the official post on Ubisoft forum, a Watch Dogs Legion bug was detected, which would cause performance issues on the game.
[71:40.19]By releasing the hotfix, the developer wrote in the post, we're developing a hotfix to address the performance issues we're seeing on PS4, Xbox, and PC.
[71:47.14]The hotfix has been deployed on PS4 and Xbox.
[71:49.50]PC gamers are left away today as the dev- Okay.

[72:10.11]Okay, let's go.
[72:15.34]A-L.
[72:21.38]I did it again.
[72:31.57]The football master has arrived.
[72:37.40]Wrong move?
[72:38.08]What are you talking about?
[72:38.82]That was my best one yet.

[77:59.01]How do you hack a book?
[78:03.76]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[78:13.62]Turn him off, disable him.
[78:15.94]Disable him.
[78:17.30]Run a search, find the hacker.
[78:27.88]What?!
[78:28.12]I have a car in my backpack?!
[78:39.83]What the fuck?!
[78:50.34]You're it.
[78:51.12]Ready to go?
[78:51.94]About bloody time.
[79:06.51]Remember the frames.
[79:07.97]Don't blame me.
[79:08.88]Blame Ubisoft.
[79:10.92]They're the ones that have a hot fix coming out.
[79:12.64]A game came out, but it's not ready.
[79:14.38]Who cares?
[79:14.76]Put it out anyways.
[79:15.54]Those fucking idiots on PC.
[79:20.28]See you in a week when it actually works.
[79:34.53]I'm getting in here.
[79:47.47]This is like too hard.
[79:48.39]There's too much shit in here that I have to deal with.
[80:05.21]There's like four drones here.
[80:07.28]I'm not supposed to be over here right now.
[80:09.70]There's no way I'm supposed to be over here.
[80:12.76]There's like four drones.
[80:22.59]Wait, this is my bike.
[80:30.17]Steal the van?
[80:30.91]Oh, get it!
[80:36.24]Oh, get it!

[81:11.78]Go!
[81:13.16]Go!
[81:13.66]What are you doing?
[81:14.24]Why is toggle on?
[81:15.18]That was the worst decision I've made all day.
[81:20.29]Got the key, Bagley.
[81:21.59]Now, scan for a decent drop site and have the house... Go, go, go, go, go!
[81:25.11]Get out of the way!
[81:25.79]Got it.
[81:26.33]Pushing the location now.

[81:28.65]Okay.
[81:29.85]Hack it!
[81:31.05]You're being followed.
[81:32.15]Try and lose them.
[81:49.17]Drive the van to the drop point, you got it.
[82:02.02]It's one kilometer away.
[82:05.72]Why can't you just make people drive?
[82:07.76]Alright, where's the drop zone?
[82:11.98]Oh, this is the first actual mission.
[82:13.38]Get out of the way, you fucking idiots!
[82:27.91]Here's the thing I remember about Watch Dogs.
[82:29.29]I remember it was kind of fun to, like, make the thing in the ground go up.
[82:35.90]Four or five times.
[82:36.76]And then it was just like, you just spam Q wherever you're driving.
[82:44.60]That's all I remember.
[82:45.28]It's just going like this.
[82:47.08]Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q. Oh, the higher turn exploded.
[82:53.21]Two FPS?

[83:11.64]It is?
[83:12.02]No, it's not.
[83:30.03]It's 30.
[83:30.17]Yeah, I mean, 30 in 2020 looks like 2.

[84:14.12]That guy got hit twice in the air.
[84:23.29]Dude, why?
[84:24.11]Did I just drive away?
[84:25.97]Hack everything?
[84:40.74]I don't even know what I just did.
[84:46.99]Reload.

[85:19.55]Get to safety.
[85:28.48]I feel like this mission was very, very hard.
[85:31.82]Am I insane for thinking this?
[85:33.40]This is like ridiculous.
[85:34.63]Oh my god.
[85:45.32]Why would I do that to myself?
[85:48.00]Bitcoins in critical condition?
[85:53.97]I did it.

[86:30.78]Please tell me the game saved after that.
[86:33.58]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[86:35.38]What the fuck is this?

[89:38.86]What is this?
[89:39.80]Deliver.
[89:42.10]Operatives can take parcels from any pickup box and deliver them to the specific donation.
[89:46.71]I don't know how that word came out.
[89:49.11]Parcels can have up to three properties, each with its own difficulty.

[97:35.67]I did.
[97:36.89]Yeah, I did.
[97:37.41]Okay.

[98:44.23]Metal graphics processing unit?
[98:47.17]It's like 8 frames a second, but it sure looks pretty good.
[98:52.55]Or an iPad.
[99:04.88]Spider-Man 2 graphics.
[99:06.72]Spider-Man 2 graphics.
[99:07.86]Spider-Man 2 graphics.

[99:33.99]I think it just is.
[99:49.47]This is it.
[99:50.05]Investigate the replacement of Ruth Sen.
[99:53.73]Okay.
[99:53.87]Let's go.
[99:54.25]GTA 4.
[99:54.39]Put it on the lowest setting.
[99:56.17]That's not going to do anything.
[99:57.23]We know that's not going to do anything.
[99:59.07]Let me pee and figure out what I want to do.
[100:16.62]I'll- I'll- Fuck.
[100:18.89]I'll be- I'ma pee.

[102:35.28]I'm doing an update my drivers stream.
[102:37.23]Here we go.
[102:40.41]No, but you guys told me about the hotfix.
[102:42.11]Ubisoft is making a hotfix because the game runs like shit.
[102:54.84]Update your drivers, man.
[102:56.30]What is this copypasta?
[103:00.19]You know, anytime you update drivers, don't you find it really sad when the default page that it lands on is the new cool one?
[103:08.09]And you have to go down three drop-down menus and scroll?
[103:10.87]Oh, fuck.
[103:12.27]GeForce 10 series.
[103:15.11]Oh, man.
[103:15.99]Alright, here we go.
[103:20.74]The stream's probably going to crash.
[103:23.04]Whatever, I'll be back.
[103:31.94]Fuck the mods.
[103:32.52]Why are you saying that?
[103:36.70]Why is everybody bullying you?
[103:39.36]It's alright.
[103:41.77]They don't mean it.
[103:43.43]That's what I tell myself every time I lie down and go to sleep.
[103:46.03]They don't mean it.
[103:46.83]They don't mean it.
[103:47.53]They don't mean it.
[103:48.19]They don't mean it.
[103:53.01]And then I refresh the page and I see like tons of toxic comments.
[103:58.42]I'm kidding.
[103:58.80]I really don't.
[104:01.56]Alright, here we go.
[104:02.70]It's time to update my graphics drivers.
[104:07.68]Are you guys ready for this fucking pog moment?
[104:10.24]Here it comes.
[104:16.21]Oh, here it comes!
[104:21.91]If the stream turns off, I will be back in 10 seconds.
[104:25.23]I don't think it will, though.
[104:34.84]Driver stream?
[104:35.48]Oh, yeah.
[104:38.77]I was here.
[104:41.35]I was here for the driver stream.
[104:52.51]I was here.
[104:52.91]I was against my will.
[104:54.73]What?
[104:56.13]What are you doing here?
[105:04.10]Here we go.
[105:04.74]Alright.
[105:05.52]NVIDIA graphics driver.
[105:07.42]Agree and continue.
[105:08.82]Don't ban me.
[105:09.98]Don't delete my stream.
[105:11.54]I'm coming back if it does.
[105:13.18]I'll be right back if the stream turns off.
[105:14.40]I promise.
[105:18.78]This is the game ready driver.
[105:20.32]I'm ready.
[105:23.38]I got a six pack of Mountain Dew.
[105:28.02]I'm ready to play Legion at the highest caliber 1080p graphics.
[105:43.45]Oh, I got what?
[105:48.09]Wake me when it's over.
[105:49.67]I will.
[105:50.13]I'll scream.
[105:51.11]I'm going to yell right in the microphone.
[105:52.81]Alright, it's installing right now.
[105:57.04]Come on, let's go.
[105:57.82]VOD watchers, skip five minutes.
[106:04.12]Actually, that's a pretty good point.
[106:05.56]Yeah.
[106:06.74]Hey, VOD watchers, just skip like two or three minutes.
[106:10.71]Oh, hey, VOD watchers.
[106:12.52]Open up the next VOD that exists.
[106:14.52]Because that's... Well, it might happen.
[106:21.73]See you in episode two.
[106:22.71]Stream two.
[106:26.79]Is it doing anything?
[106:27.48]Why is it taking so long?
[106:44.49]Hello?
[106:46.45]Everything just went black.
[106:50.57]Am I still live?
[106:52.35]I don't know.
[106:52.67]I have no idea.
[106:55.05]I might be.
[107:00.71]Hey, I'm still live.
[107:02.01]We're good.
[107:02.35]I didn't have to turn the stream off.
[107:04.61]It has been installed.
[107:05.55]We're ready to go.
[107:06.75]All right.
[107:07.09]Let's go.
[107:07.45]Let's go.
[107:07.80]Let's go.
[107:08.14]Let's go.
[107:08.48]Let's go.
[107:08.82]Let's go.
[107:09.16]Let's go.
[107:09.52]Let's go.
[107:09.90]You guys hyped Watch Dogs Legion?
[107:13.04]Let's go.
[107:19.77]Here it comes.
[107:24.82]Fuck, dude.
[107:25.48]I'm so excited for this game.
[107:27.82]You have no idea.
[107:32.90]Hold on.
[107:33.24]My epic games launcher doesn't work anymore.
[107:45.58]Here we go.
[107:53.50]I implore you to give this game a chance.
[107:55.32]I know you're being a ha-ha funny YouTuber by killing everyone and complaining about corporate Ubisoft, which I completely understand, but please at least play through the first few tutorial missions and see how social- how the social mechanics of this game are set up, and that- it's actually a lot like the Nemesis system, you know, the thing that you in chat absolutely loved.
[108:13.35]I implore you.
[108:14.63]Well, I'm- I'm not- I'm still going.
[108:17.39]I'm still streaming.
[108:18.07]I'm just waiting for the game to work.
[108:28.93]Alright, here it comes.
[108:30.75]I promise this time it is coming.
[108:34.08]Is that a coffee pasta or is that somebody's actual real opinion?
[108:48.62]I'm going for it.
[108:49.42]I'm gonna.
[108:54.86]Alright.
[108:56.75]Stream starts now.
[109:02.96]You heard the system booting?
[109:05.30]There it is.
[109:06.94]We have new, we have the brand new today graphics drivers.
[109:13.34]Let's go.
[109:13.68]I was never saying nude.
[109:37.49]Okay.
[109:39.47]Continue.
[109:41.29]Show it to me.
[109:45.85]Loading screen, menu, loading screen, 60 FPS incoming.
[109:50.86]Fuck.
[110:07.94]Uh, this is, uh, this is not internet.
[110:15.50]Oh, come on.
[110:17.02]I, did I download graphics drivers and they like fucking corrupted my system?
[110:29.21]I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put, I'm gonna load this thing up like they shoot the clay discs.
[110:36.96]I'm just gonna pull!
[110:39.00]I'm gonna shoot with a rocket launcher.
[110:40.34]You downloaded the wrong drivers?
[110:49.42]No, I didn't.
[110:50.34]It's taking so much longer.
[110:54.47]It's taking like three times as long.
[110:58.53]Fuck.
[111:05.43]Is it updating?
[111:10.53]No, it's going.
[111:11.19]We're just going to leave it alone.
[111:18.95]You need to restart the computer.
[111:29.50]Oh, God.
[111:30.32]I just saw it tick.
[111:37.50]Hold on.
[111:45.98]Wait, are we in?
[111:54.00]I'm gonna give this 30 seconds that I'm restarting my fucking computer.
[111:56.61]Pain in the ass.
[111:58.87]And you guys wonder why, like, consoles sell so well.
[112:16.80]It is moving though, it is.
[112:26.80]Is anybody else curious to see what happens when it gets to the end?
[112:33.61]Shh.
[112:35.31]Use the talk shit and it's done.
[112:40.97]We're in!
[112:42.61]I might have just found us some fresh meat.
[112:45.25]Ready?
[112:49.82]What the fuck happened to that guy?
[112:57.66]Alright!
[112:58.64]Game ready driver!
[113:03.07]What's going on over here?
[113:10.47]Uh... This lady... That's a lot!
[113:17.04]How many times are you gonna do this?
[113:21.97]Got him.
[113:23.09]Now go, run!
[113:55.61]Alright, I'm good.
[114:00.19]Bad framerate.
[114:03.13]Awww.
[114:04.51]The FPS is so bad.
[114:06.15]It is so bad.
[114:15.70]Lower all the- They're already pretty fucking low, man.
[114:37.29]I can't, they don't even let you put it on low.
[114:46.07]Why is that on?
[114:47.97]Fuck it, we're going, we're going 2001.
[114:49.97]Full screen mode?
[114:52.48]Are you telling me that's the bullshit that's gonna be a problem?
[115:00.78]Better not be.
[115:03.00]This better not be the fucking problem.
[115:24.18]They're actually running better.
[115:32.04]Use DirectX 11?
[115:34.02]Troubleshoot the streamer's video game so it doesn't look like GTA 3, the stream.
[115:46.63]Put it on DX 11?
[115:48.01]How do I do that though?
[115:49.19]How do I put it on DirectX 11?
[115:56.13]I didn't know how to do that.
[115:56.99]I'm not going to lower the resolution.
[116:06.05]Is it in the options?
[116:07.11]Options?
[116:07.70]Is it in video?
[116:10.58]GTX 1080.
[116:16.76]It's in the video settings.
[116:19.18]Field of view.
[116:20.28]Monitor refresh rate resolution.
[116:21.60]Where do you see that?
[116:27.70]Look, I got plenty of VRAM.
[116:32.71]DirectX 11.
[116:34.15]Oh, God fucking damn it!
[117:01.82]So, how was your day today?
[117:06.98]Worst stream 2020.
[117:08.82]Contender incoming.
[117:11.23]I'll be your host for the evening.
[117:14.55]Sherman left.
[117:16.13]He walked out after he had to restart his game 15 times and when it crashed twice in the tutorial.
[117:22.91]He had to download game-ready Legion Drivers.
[117:27.93]He seems to have gone out of the room.
[117:34.03]I'll be playing now.
[117:35.82]I'm a better streamer.
[117:41.14]Restart your fucking computer.
[117:43.92]If I restart the computer, the stream goes off.
[117:46.58]I need like a stream battery that keeps the stream turned on.
[117:56.92]Let's go.
[117:58.49]The X11, not the X12.
[118:00.23]That's the bad one.
[118:00.95]That's the one that sucks.
[118:01.61]That's the one that causes problems for every PC.
[118:03.31]I remember that.
[118:15.01]You're number 5 in the Watch Dogs category.
[118:17.19]Fuck!
[118:20.24]Look at how lightning quick that just loaded.
[118:22.96]Did you see that?
[118:23.58]This is the fastest I've ever seen a loading screen start.
[118:56.05]Streamer, do you have an SSD?
[118:57.41]Yes, I have three of them.
[119:02.31]Alright, my computer might be a few years old, but it's not like I have hard drives in here.
[119:06.56]He's fuming right now.
[119:10.80]Actually, that's kind of entertaining in a way for me.
[119:16.92]DX11Andy.
[119:20.97]You're the second highest English-speaking watchdog streamer.
[119:27.77]Who's the first?
[119:29.09]Why can't I be number one?
[119:48.79]Mechanical Drive Matthew!
[119:51.01]Stop!
[119:51.53]Alright, this is it.
[119:52.59]I'm getting in here and I'm playing.
[119:54.51]And if not, I'm gonna- I'll hold the power button off on my fucking computer, I swear to god if it's still fucked up.
[119:59.75]And I'm gonna turn it back on and come back in five minutes.
[120:14.46]You can't be number one because the other guy's not doing a troubleshooting stream.
[120:18.93]Shit!
[120:19.25]I need a better computer!
[120:20.35]I need a better computer!
[120:22.22]I gotta get a better computer now!
[120:24.36]Oh shit!
[120:44.11]I think it just needed a few minutes to load!
[120:48.27]Dude, this looks fine.
[120:54.86]This looks pretty, this looks okay.
[120:56.20]This looks alright.
[121:00.10]Wait, why is it, what is it doing that?
[121:04.84]No, no, no, trust me, trust me.
[121:05.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait for it to refresh a little bit.
[121:09.12]Bingo.
[121:10.76]Bingo.
[121:11.48]We got 60 FPS.
[121:12.10]Let's go.
[121:12.52]Let's go.
[121:27.82]Skipped frames detected.
[121:29.16]What's doing this?
[121:29.86]Why is it doing this?
[121:30.62]What's going on?
[121:40.68]I'll be back.
[121:41.21]Give me five minutes.
[121:42.15]Fucking turn the computer.
[121:43.03]I'm just turning the computer off.
[121:43.89]I'm not even going to turn the stream off.
[121:44.95]I'm just turning off the computer.
[121:46.25]I'm restarting.
[121:47.27]I can't even restart my computer.
[121:49.21]The Windows button doesn't even work.
[121:50.13]I'm back into...
[121:56.34]I'm just hitting the power button I'll be back in two minutes come back and watch my watchdog streams I'm number two god damn it I'm gonna be number one hey hey hey I'm here I'm here I'm here number two come on I'm the number two guy right here hey I'm back I'm back I'm back okay I restarted the stream I restarted watchdogs legion is now starting here we go it's coming
[122:20.69]Somebody said, wow, Stroud's stream looks great.
[122:23.49]I'm sure it does.
[122:24.16]I'm sure it looks fantastic.
[122:25.48]I'm sure it looks really good.
[122:26.86]But mine, I'm going to get a better computer soon, and then it'll be better.
[122:45.19]I left for an hour.
[122:46.05]What have I missed?
[122:49.33]Not a whole lot.
[122:51.09]Not a whole lot.
[122:54.30]All right.
[122:55.52]Watch Dogs Legion.
[122:56.96]Here we go.
[122:57.64]I'm going to get that 3090.
[123:00.28]I'm going to get like a 35 core PC.
[123:01.84]A 3090, two of them.
[123:08.65]I'm gonna have to have a dedicated energy account just for this computer, I swear to God.
[123:15.16]You lost 2,000 viewers?
[123:16.00]It's alright, they'll be back in like 10 minutes.
[123:26.62]Okay, we have restarted.
[123:29.29]I have dropped my stream settings to be able to handle this.
[123:34.67]Game has been restarted.
[123:36.63]I'm ready.
[123:37.36]It's in DirectX 11.
[123:41.74]I have the new driver.
[123:43.38]I'm ready to play Watch Dogs Legion on launch day.
[123:46.34]Turn on V-Sync, you idiot.
[123:51.84]Isn't turning on V-Sync the same thing as saying Voldemort?
[123:56.11]I thought all gamers on PC weren't allowed to do that.
[124:00.27]Here we go.
[124:02.31]Let's take a look, okay?
[124:03.15]Okay.
[124:05.42]Continue.
[124:11.15]Wait, I'll do it.
[124:11.91]Okay, let me do that first.
[124:15.05]Video.
[124:16.59]Full screen.
[124:18.61]Desync.
[124:20.02]Normal.
[124:20.42]I guess.
[124:22.00]Okay, normal.
[124:22.76]Here we go.
[124:27.50]Campaign.
[124:28.52]Continue.
[124:29.91]Let's go.
[124:59.45]Ah, hey.
[124:59.97]Alright.
[125:00.65]It looks just as bad as it did 20 minutes ago.
[125:02.17]Dude, why is it doing this? ...
[125:29.04]Wait, are we good?
[125:32.41]No, it... My computer can't handle Watch Dogs Legion.
[125:41.41]I can't.
[125:42.19]I just can't do it.
[125:43.53]My CPU can't run it.
[125:45.46]I can't run it.
[125:49.16]I can run it on DX12.
[125:58.22]No, I don't want to do this again!
[126:01.27]DX12 and I'm gonna put like the geometry on high!
[126:11.80]Don't restart yet, hold on.
[126:15.02]Resolution is 1080.
[126:15.98]It's the PC patch, not your PC.
[126:29.33]Go to 720.
[126:29.87]No, that's too ugly.
[126:30.89]I can't.
[126:33.71]Turn off V-Sync.
[126:34.73]Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
[126:36.25]I'm gonna go back to DX... Revert.
[126:39.96]Let's go back to DX12.
[126:42.38]I'm gonna put the geometry... I'm gonna keep this here.
[126:45.38]Everything... That's... We're gonna put some load on the... On the GPU.
[126:52.94]Major load.
[126:53.73]No, I don't want major load on the CPU.
[126:59.36]Why does my CPU suck?
[127:03.33]My CPU doesn't even suck, though.
[127:08.53]I have a 6-core, like, 6800.
[127:17.44]If this don't work, if this still looks like shit, then I'm just gonna do tier lists for, like, two or three hours.
[127:23.84]Get them ready.
[127:24.34]Get your favorite tier list ready, because Watch Dogs Legion fucking throw it into the trash.
[127:47.68]Here we go.
[127:51.60]Six cores, not enough in 2020.
[127:53.36]That's plenty of cores.
[127:54.44]That's a lot of cores.
[127:55.50]I just got $50 for like the worst stream I've done all month.
[128:03.39]It's from Phylactery Lich.
[128:04.41]Thank you, Phylactery.
[128:05.11]5,000 bits.
[128:08.50]Remember, please buy a new computer.
[128:09.58]I'm begging you.
[128:10.60]Yeah, but I am.
[128:11.98]I just was waiting until like 3090s and 3080s were back in stock and the new Risen processors just dropped.
[128:20.11]This shit's happening like this weekend.
[128:21.89]Like, I'm gonna get a supercomputer.
[128:28.89]I'm coming back to Watch Dogs Legion when I get this new computer and we're gonna put everything on ultra and I'm just gonna run around and just punch people and laugh and say, see where we are.
[128:35.87]Alright, let's try it.
[128:37.41]Get your tier list ready because I'm about to fucking have a meltdown.
[128:40.27]What about AI dungeon?
[128:56.80]Oh, maybe.
[129:12.62]You made your, uh... I put- I went down to 70?
[129:16.14]Okay, well it runs.
[129:24.83]It runs, but not very good.
[129:26.47]I fucking swear to god.
[129:34.11]dude this ain't my computer this ain't my computer it's not there's no way that's not my computer this is fucking dumb game there's no fucking way this is my pc he's in denial no it can't be no other streamers are good but why why am I not good why am I not good
[130:04.84]What the heck?
[130:06.02]It's not fair.
[130:06.86]I was supposed to be number two.
[130:08.82]I was the number two guy.
[130:10.14]It was supposed to be me.
[130:10.96]Put it on XP compatibility mode.
[130:21.59]Fuck!
[130:22.67]It was supposed to be me, you know?
[130:24.15]I was supposed to be that guy.
[130:25.19]I was supposed to be the number two spot.
[130:27.81]I was gonna be able to look over and see like Shroud right there and be like, Shroud!
[130:31.71]Pog!
[130:33.16]This stream looks so good, too, and I need, like, a good stream like his.
[130:36.76]Alright, I'm... I'm doing this one more time.
[130:41.26]I have to try one more time.
[130:50.89]Why?
[130:51.31]Why?
[130:51.73]Because it's called... I've... Okay, I've lost $99,999.
[130:54.47]I have $1 left.
[131:02.98]And I'm putting it on black.
[131:05.33]And if it hits, then I get $2.
[131:07.39]And at least I got a victory out of this.
[131:20.68]You're in denial.
[131:21.72]I know.
[131:22.30]That's okay, though.
[131:24.30]Okay, here's the really wacky thing, okay?
[131:27.04]My CPU usage right now is like 19%.
[131:32.09]What the hell is happening?
[131:33.93]This is not like putting a bottleneck on my computer.
[131:37.31]This is wacky shit.
[131:38.36]My CPU is at 22% right now.
[131:42.70]This is wacky shit, don't you think?
[131:53.49]I want to see what it is.
[132:01.06]It's zany.
[132:02.08]Oh, Twitch staff is here.
[132:03.30]I think I'm gonna be on good behavior.
[132:13.74]If you use liquid, what?
[132:16.90]Open up a benchmark.
[132:24.68]It's because you have a pirated copy of the game.

[133:53.23]We got decent frames.
[133:54.23]It just looks like dog shit.
[133:56.39]Decent frames, but at what cost?
[134:02.80]All right.
[134:03.44]We're good.
[134:04.20]We're good.
[134:04.52]We're good.

[134:17.92]Okay.
[134:18.76]Restricted area.
[134:19.50]Investigate the replacement.
[134:26.16]Take a look at security cameras.
[134:27.28]Time to hack the world.
[134:29.56]Hack the world!
[134:31.27]Only if you have a graphics card that's at least in the 2000 generation of NVIDIA.
[134:37.73]You got anything less than that?
[134:38.61]You don't get to hack the world.
[134:40.35]Well, you do, but you get to kind of slowly get to hack the world.
[134:47.85]Pretty bad frames.
[134:55.07]Huge bits.
[134:56.35]Hey Master Fleet, thanks for the $50 for the PC fund!
[135:00.43]I- Don't worry, I'm gonna get one.
[135:01.65]Alright, I'm gonna take this guy down.
[135:11.70]Thank you for the $50 though, that's an insane amount of money.
[135:14.40]Can I like kick this thing when it's on the ground?
[135:20.44]Who the fuck is this?
[135:33.33]You know when like you just get taken out of a groove because like you spent the last 40 minutes trying to get the game to run?
[135:50.59]What the hell was that?
[135:51.15]Nice trip?
[136:01.54]I fucking hate the drones.
[136:02.56]The drones are stupid.
[136:03.54]What a dumb thing to have in the game.
[136:05.04]Dumb, stupid game, stupid, dumb game, dumb game, stupid, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
[136:25.40]Sit down.

[136:28.66]Who the fuck is this?
[136:29.36]I don't have battery power.
[136:42.81]Dude, I haven't even done the first mission of the game.
[136:46.49]I'm realizing this is just like hard mode secondary shit.
[136:49.78]I need to do the actual mission.
[136:54.41]What the fuck?!
[136:58.18]I can't even do this!
[137:05.06]Get out of my face!
[137:08.40]You fuckin' tin can!

[137:26.36]Go, go, go!
[137:26.82]Get in, get in!
[137:31.09]Who needs advanced hacking when you have idiots that open doors for free?
[137:40.38]Fucking goddammit.
[137:56.11]I'm good.
[137:58.09]Who?
[138:01.29]Where are they?
[138:01.67]Oh my god, there's a person here.
[138:04.84]Shoot him!
[138:05.36]What?! !
[138:26.67]What's that?

[138:27.25]What's that on me?
[138:31.97]Hey, what's that on your phone?
[138:32.99]Somebody just sent you a wicked funny meme on the internet.
[138:35.71]Okay, go.
[138:43.98]Get out of here.
[138:53.32]Hack it.
[138:53.58]Hack this.
[138:53.90]Hack this thing.
[138:57.84]Hack it!
[138:58.36]Is it just me?
[138:58.91]Is it just me?
[138:59.53]Fuck, what?
[139:00.67]Download.
[139:02.99]Alright, downloading at 5%.
[139:03.91]Oh, look at that view count skyrocketing.
[139:26.44]What's wrong with this?
[139:27.90]Oh, this thing is sad.
[139:28.96]This is sad.
[139:33.53]I had to put it out of its misery.
[139:35.27]It was flying around.
[139:46.59]I did it.
[139:46.93]Okay.
[139:51.05]Uh-oh.
[139:53.43]I can't leave.
[140:05.38]Wait, wait, wait, I'm good.
[140:07.40]I got it.
[140:13.42]Thank god I can do it from inside.
[140:34.22]Go, we're out.
[140:36.35]See, this game's not bad.
[140:37.47]Look at this fun, cool thing I just did.
[140:39.47]What do we have?
[140:40.55]Well, I found our prospect's replacement.
[140:43.01]It's an AI.
[140:44.47]And a pretty shoddy one at that.
[140:46.15]Nowhere near as smart as me.
[140:48.01]It could maybe replace a few million humans at most.
[140:51.57]Bloody hell.
[140:53.13]Oh, right.
[140:53.65]I suppose from your perspective, that's a lot.
[140:55.93]If you like, we can go destroy it before it puts anyone else out of work.
[140:59.63]Very good.
[141:00.67]Forward me the coordinates.
[141:02.31]All right, I got it.
[141:04.70]We're good.
[141:05.46]Now, okay, now I'm going to do a mission.
[141:07.73]Let's go do a real mission.
[141:08.95]Not one of these fake missions.
[141:10.15]A real one.
[141:11.71]Here we go.
[141:12.21]Recruit Seth Den.
[141:13.87]That's not a real mission.
[141:21.33]Here it is.
[141:22.61]Track this, please.
[141:25.68]What are my skill points?
[141:26.54]Hell yeah, let's go.
[141:27.34]There's my team.
[141:31.78]What has he got?
[141:33.99]New operative.
[141:34.65]I can switch to this operative!
[141:37.90]Is this guy dead?
[141:40.38]Alright, I'm good for now.
[141:56.25]You beat his ass and now he wants to be on the team.
[142:23.30]What is this?
[142:23.86]Hold on, there's tech points in here.
[142:25.10]Let's see what... Oh wait, recruitment!
[142:35.37]No, no, no, no more recruitments!
[142:41.14]Are they gonna get on stage?
[142:52.63]Oh, free money!
[143:10.80]Oops.
[143:11.26]Okay.

[143:23.68]Somebody... What?
[143:27.16]This thing zips.
[143:32.59]Holy shit.
[143:33.21]Look at this thing.
[143:33.75]Okay.
[143:41.10]Alright, raise it.
[143:43.23]What do I mean checkpoint?
[143:54.03]Alright, Albion.
[143:59.01]Operations data.
[144:00.27]Albion propaganda.
[144:01.25]Let's do mission one.
[144:03.39]Alright.
[144:16.56]Now this is pod racing.
[144:28.77]In here.
[144:29.03]Alright, get me out of this.
[144:32.61]Sneak into this place.
[144:33.45]Did you just take a picture of me?
[144:37.66]Taking photos of me?
[144:38.54]Alright, this is restricted.
[144:42.66]Get operations data and get the propaganda.
[144:46.47]Restricted areas are dangerous.
[144:48.81]Press V to scan the area to reveal scouting opportunities.
[144:51.83]I'm glad I got this tutorial now.
[144:55.53]Captains will call for reinforcements if they detect you.
[144:57.53]Eliminate them before they do.
[145:01.54]Cameras, drones, traps.
[145:03.14]Got it.
[145:03.40]Up there.
[145:03.68]Should I download something?
[145:19.39]I love this PS2 game.
[145:20.95]Me too.
[145:21.91]It's very fun.
[145:22.53]Alright, what is that?
[145:24.31]Is that a GTX 3090?
[145:25.73]Is somebody talking to me?
[145:29.72]Alright, I definitely have to do that.
[145:34.80]Let's go up there.
[145:39.44]Can I do anything with this?
[145:41.96]Can't download that from here.
[145:42.92]I can't fuck with this from here.
[145:48.07]Oh, I can do that.
[145:49.75]Hijack this.
[145:50.43]Is it a mouse trap?
[145:59.77]What else you got?
[146:01.58]Got him.
[146:03.18]Only one guy left.
[146:03.82]Anybody else in here?

[146:14.16]Got him.
[146:17.82]Okay.
[146:18.60]I think we're clear.
[146:19.14]I can go in now, right?

[146:23.36]There's a guy here.
[146:24.34]Alright, alright, alright.
[146:24.84]Hold on.
[146:25.10]Distract you.

[146:38.45]Alright, there's the power source.
[146:40.99]We gotta turn the power on.
[146:41.71]Everybody's dead.
[146:45.61]I'm fine.
[146:52.71]Play Batman Arkham Asylum.
[146:54.85]I beat that game on the hardest difficulty five times and I was like 20.
[146:57.26]No.
[146:57.92]And if you believe that, then you're a sucker.
[147:16.59]Shit!
[147:17.33]Did you take two headshots?
[147:21.51]Nobody, right?
[147:22.05]Wait!
[147:22.63]I got it.
[147:22.91]It's fine.
[147:25.55]Get that data.
[147:25.95]Pull your head up.
[147:36.44]We're good.
[147:39.24]See?
[147:39.48]First mission done.

[147:48.32]What?
[147:49.32]That was a challenge mode?
[147:50.66]No, I wanted to do the mission.
[147:53.66]Bagley, what do we have?
[147:55.14]A list of what Albion consider high-value targets that are threats to the peaceful running of London.
[148:00.79]See here?
[148:01.47]A journalist.
[148:02.31]And this one runs a community shelter.
[148:04.55]Good God.
[148:05.39]Bar your doors.
[148:05.87]What do we need to do?
[148:08.97]No.
[148:09.03]Okay.
[148:10.17]This is across the whole city.
[148:11.29]Um...
[148:18.55]This is still the tutorial.
[148:21.79]Oh.
[148:21.87]The gadgets are useful.
[148:22.81]I'm sure they are.
[148:23.67]Gamers.
[148:23.97]Oh, this is one of those games that runs good when it becomes dusk.
[148:27.53]It's one of those games.
[148:28.35]Cool.
[148:28.51]Press 4.
[149:03.05]There's essays in chat.
[149:05.63]What are they saying?
[149:06.25]Are they talking about me?
[149:07.51]Are they making fun of me?
[149:11.16]It really is GTA 4.
[149:12.36]This is not good.
[149:17.12]It's actually kind of worse than GTA 4.
[149:24.09]I need a new computer so bad.
[149:26.15]It's not even funny anymore.
[149:27.69]It was funny like two weeks ago.
[149:30.37]Now it's like
[149:32.98]Get a new computer.
[149:41.65]Saints Row 3.
[149:42.89]You know I was going to play Saints Row 2 like last week.
[149:49.88]This runs bad on a 3090.
[149:50.70]Why do I feel like that's the norm?
[149:58.60]That...
[150:01.58]I've lost control of the car, okay?
[150:03.18]Alright.
[150:19.63]In here.
[150:19.95]We have to disrupt the propaganda.
[150:25.15]This is not restricted.
[150:26.19]This is ATM.
[150:28.35]Oh, shit.
[150:29.17]I just... ATM money...
[150:33.22]I'm not supposed to take it all.
[150:34.16]Can I go in here?
[150:47.07]No.
[150:47.39]I'm fucked with a gamer.
[150:48.47]That's what I said.
[151:00.67]You're in good hands.
[151:01.65]Alright, so I've changed the... So we gotta hack the thing to make it look like it's ugly or something?
[151:26.41]Propaganda.
[151:27.79]Propaganda.
[151:28.48]Alright, we have to disrupt the propaganda.
[151:31.72]I didn't even hit you.
[151:32.94]I didn't hit you.
[151:33.32]You're fine.
[151:34.22]I didn't even hit you.
[151:35.66]You did not get hit by that bike.
[151:37.54]By the way, how do you feel about the government?
[151:42.22]Get up.
[151:43.38]I need to recruit you.

[152:28.93]And how excited are you guys for Watch Dogs 3?
[152:31.03]Wait, I'm not gonna be able to get back in this.
[152:39.29]Who cares?
[152:39.75]Ooh, tech!
[152:51.86]He hates it.
[152:52.56]I don't.

[153:17.71]Can I go inside of this?
[153:21.04]Um, no.
[153:21.88]Sorry, Nancy, you can't do that.
[153:24.00]Nobody can do that.
[153:34.03]Alright, turn it off.
[153:39.65]Congratulations, you've done the first mission of Watch Dogs.
[153:47.19]We shall never surrender.
[153:48.27]Hey!

[154:23.89]Why is it drive?
[154:24.45]What's wrong with this thing?
[154:25.77]It's running over a box?
[154:27.27]Oh, come on.
[154:27.55]Alright, goodbye.
[154:28.27]It was fun.
[154:52.13]Meet with a dead second foreman.
[155:00.80]I can do that.

[155:03.14]Why is this up?
[155:13.27]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[155:16.09]Yo, that car looks sick.
[155:17.40]Yeah, it does.
[155:20.64]This does kind of look like Batman.
[155:22.18]Yeah, now that you say that, I can see it.
[155:23.62]Okay, meet with the informant.
[155:40.36]Hi.

[155:46.47]Neil Brown.
[155:47.11]Stole Albion weapon schematics.
[155:49.21]He knows how to summon drones, and he's got extra faction damage.
[155:55.87]Alright.
[156:00.72]He's a summoner?
[156:01.32]Even more money came in.
[156:03.74]Holy shit, guys.
[156:04.46]Devilex gave $50.
[156:15.65]I have insomnia gave $50 back-to-back Actually good computer fund and here's some money seed money for a better laptop because you're playing on one clearly Dude when I build this new computer We're gonna do a super benchmark stream
[156:42.94]Put it out of commission and you'll severely hamstring Albion's operations here in Camden.
[156:47.26]Hell everywhere.
[156:48.72]Then that's our move.
[156:53.83]I'm going to run this thing through hell.
[156:55.53]Okay.
[156:55.89]No, don't kill him.
[157:13.02]I haven't seen a car drive out.
[157:15.18]Like somebody finally got the car in the mall out.
[157:19.77]Oh my god, he got the car out of the mall.
[157:28.15]You bastard, I can't believe somebody actually was able to do that.
[157:37.93]And then one of the, like, a representative from the mall is like, well, I mean, this kind of was the point.
[157:43.08]We left the keys in there.
[157:44.10]We were just waiting for somebody to drive out of the, uh, out of the JCPenney.
[157:52.52]It's just a free car.
[157:53.53]I just went in a circle.

[158:25.58]Jesus!
[158:26.30]Okay, we can get a drone.
[158:26.90]Hijack a news drone.
[158:27.84]Okay.
[158:28.00]Hijack.
[158:28.32]Up, down, flash.
[158:28.86]Find the information generator.
[158:57.49]I'll go spotlight.
[158:58.21]Turn that off.
[158:59.57]Oh, hey.
[159:00.13]Oh, shit.
[159:00.51]Drone fight.
[159:02.18]Drone fight.
[159:02.66]Get out of here.
[159:08.02]What happened?
[159:15.16]Photograph the generator.
[159:16.42]What happened?
[159:25.65]Just use cover.
[159:30.87]Alright.
[159:31.19]There's the schematics.
[159:31.87]Photograph it.
[159:33.97]How many do I need?
[159:34.45]F. Okay.
[159:38.97]Download the detonation code.
[159:40.17]Fuck.
[159:40.33]It's okay.
[159:40.93]Just weave.
[160:03.08]Fuck.
[160:03.42]Weave.
[160:09.88]Got it!
[160:12.04]Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.
[160:13.40]47%.
[160:13.42]50%.
[160:13.44]55%.
[160:13.46]60%.
[160:23.56]We almost loaded the game.
[160:37.56]Back faster.
[160:38.40]I'm going as fast as I can.
[160:39.48]Alright, back to the generator.
[160:41.38]This is exhilarating.
[160:42.22]Is it?
[160:42.42]Wait, should I go flash this guy in the face?
[160:44.31]Should I leave?
[161:07.79]Oh shit, it exploded.
[161:08.71]That was you.
[161:18.16]Oh.
[161:30.44]City of London.
[161:31.02]London was fine?
[161:31.52]What do you mean?
[162:01.20]That was off the chain, mate.
[162:02.96]I knew DedSec weren't the bad guys Albion was saying.
[162:05.99]London was fine.
[162:07.91]Thanks.
[162:08.75]Thanks.
[162:09.59]Now that you've shown the borough what DedSec is really all about, there are going to be folks wanting to join up.
[162:14.15]A lot of people have been looking for a way to fight back.
[162:16.77]Let me have the title of my stream make sense, finally.
[162:20.39]I happen to know their champion at the bit.
[162:23.23]At this point, I think we'll take all comers.
[162:25.29]DedSec needs people.
[162:33.54]Spray... what?
[162:34.68]What's wrong with my hair?
[162:36.00]DeadSec support.
[162:38.42]Complete burrow activities to increase DeadSec support.
[162:41.34]You get tech points.
[162:42.72]Skilled recruits have abilities or weapons that are valuable to DeadSec.
[162:46.78]When a burrow becomes defiant, a skilled recruit will be added to the team.
[162:50.57]You got it.
[162:50.93]Alright, let's go find an old lady and ask her if she wants to join.
[162:53.63]Wait, what?
[163:00.39]Who did I recruit?
[163:05.70]Game doesn't normally look this bad.
[163:07.08]Well, it does when you put it on the lowest settings.
[163:10.36]Because it's the only way you can play it.
[163:11.46]Recruit a kid?
[163:11.78]What?
[163:32.07]Every time we switch, the last person has to die.
[163:35.26]We're just jumping hosts.
[163:44.69]What is it?
[163:45.69]The Signals Intelligence Response Service, or SIRS, or the Earl Grey Gestapo, have developed a surveillance technology called AR reconstruction.
[163:54.02]It's the leading edge of privacy rights violation, and thus it could be very useful in our attempts to find Zero Day.
[164:00.84]It's just a symbiote.
[164:03.72]I don't like this human sheet anymore.
[164:05.87]All right.
[164:07.97]We need to find an old lady.
[164:09.37]Old lady.
[164:10.57]Nope.
[164:11.21]Whoa.
[164:12.37]I just barely touched.
[164:13.63]Yeah.
[164:17.01]Alright, we're fine.
[164:20.96]Old lady, old lady, old lady.
[164:30.85]Old lady!
[164:32.11]Nope.
[164:33.33]Old lady!
[164:33.79]Nope.
[164:43.18]Go find the queen.
[164:50.56]Whatever, we're a new operative now.
[165:02.82]I'm just keeping my eye out for old ladies.
[165:08.31]Just auto drive and look around.
[165:09.49]Alright.
[165:20.34]Nope, don't see any.
[165:21.98]Nope.
[165:25.36]Looking for old ladies.
[165:28.18]The older the better.
[165:34.73]Old.
[165:34.95]Oh, I saw the gameplay trailer.
[165:41.99]I want to do it.
[165:47.15]I want to see the gameplay trailer.
[165:58.17]There's no old people in London?
[165:59.83]It's a rare spawn.
[166:14.14]An old lady's a rare spawn?
[166:17.70]No.
[166:25.15]No, I thought that was an old man.
[166:30.71]Keep your eyes open.
[166:39.90]Hello?
[166:41.54]Excuse me.
[166:43.30]I have a proposition for you.
[166:46.56]I'm from... Nah, I thought you were old.
[166:51.72]Never mind.
[166:52.26]Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
[167:02.82]Not old enough.
[167:05.44]Excuse me.
[167:06.04]Jesus, come on dude, get out of the way.
[167:27.21]I'm slowly going over to the new mission too, by the way.
[167:37.87]Hold.
[167:40.67]Construction worker.
[167:44.65]No, where are the old ladies?
[167:45.67]AR tech.
[167:50.97]Can I get in this way?
[167:52.05]No, I gotta go the other way.
[167:53.35]Around the other side.
[168:15.15]Casino.
[168:15.77]Go to the casino.
[168:20.71]Is there a casino in this game?
[168:33.34]You old?
[168:37.56]Excuse me, Emma.
[168:39.22]I'd like to offer you a contract.
[168:47.06]How are you?
[168:48.20]How do you feel about the world right now?
[168:49.82]Don't you feel like that you would want to become part of something more?
[168:57.97]Emma!
[168:59.39]I'd like to recruit you.
[169:01.27]We have things to talk about.
[169:02.85]Don't you think you want to be part of something more?
[169:04.93]Something bigger than yourself?
[169:07.93]Trying to gather intel on Albion personnel movements through the city.
[169:11.09]Looks like she wants to stay one step ahead of the goons.
[169:13.51]Smart.
[169:14.33]That is smart, yeah.
[169:15.31]Let's help her.
[169:16.57]Could turn into a nice little asset.
[169:18.69]A Ponzi scheme?
[169:19.67]Look, you just have to sell 400 lipsticks and eye powders every week and you'll make $40.
[169:22.79]I'm telling you, it's the opportunity of a lifetime.
[169:37.85]Okay.
[169:38.65]Steal an Albion armored vehicle.
[169:42.95]You got it.
[169:49.85]Any armored vehicle, right?
[169:51.29]Doesn't matter where?
[170:01.51]You're blind.
[170:02.25]Am I?
[170:04.73]I am?
[170:11.24]Fucking cartoon.
[170:12.56]Tom and Jerry cartoon.
[170:14.08]Can I play a game normally for once?
[170:22.37]Oh, here's one.
[170:29.23]Grandma, I got one.
[170:30.43]I got it.
[170:42.11]All of a sudden, a little tornado is gonna come pick me up and I'm gonna get three tubes to pick to skip a third of each portion of this game.
[171:04.91]That's, um, that's some deep reference right there.
[171:09.25]And I feel bad for those who don't understand it.
[171:12.25]That's a deep reference.
[171:22.59]Wrong way.
[171:28.77]It's not deep, it sucked.
[171:31.83]But you just got yourself a timeout.
[171:36.69]Next stream.
[171:38.53]I'll remember your name.
[171:42.50]Next stream, you're getting timed out.
[171:44.74]You know what?
[171:45.08]Fucking who cares?
[171:45.78]Run over.
[171:55.95]I've got places to be.
[171:56.73]I have an old lady to recruit.
[172:01.99]Oh my goodness.
[172:02.65]Thank God you weren't on that other bench.
[172:18.66]Get grandma.
[172:19.40]I'm getting her.
[172:20.02]Distraction.
[172:23.75]Yes, you have.
[172:24.55]I'm safe.
[172:25.75]This is so far away.
[173:00.24]It's a very long drive.
[173:01.42]I think that person's still under my car.
[173:06.35]Are they?
[173:17.95]NA driving in EU.
[173:19.89]Is that going to explode?
[173:39.43]American streamer.
[173:40.35]He's on the wrong side of the road.
[173:42.03]American streamer.
[173:42.97]Yeah, that's me.
[173:49.79]Alright.
[173:50.73]It's time to play as Old Lady for the rest of the game.
[173:53.14]And I don't even care if it's the worst.
[173:54.64]Awesome.
[173:58.14]Okay.
[173:58.28]Here we go.
[173:58.62]Hey.
[173:58.78]That... Where are you?
[174:21.17]Talk to Emma.
[174:22.09]Oh.
[174:30.41]Emma?
[174:31.35]I've returned your car.
[174:37.44]Don't.
[174:39.78]Yes, she has.
[174:45.42]Yes, finally.
[174:49.25]So is bringing the entire bloody car your AI... Excellent.
[174:54.47]And I talk like this.
[174:55.31]...phrasing often leaves something to be desired.
[174:57.74]But the hard drive in that vehicle should more than suit your purposes.
[175:01.74]You bet your arse.
[175:03.48]Armed with this, I'll be able to dance circles around those Albion thugs and shove a boot up their backsides.
[175:11.08]If you need anything at all, I'm at your service.
[175:14.42]Hey, how about now?
[175:15.28]DeadSec could always use more people.
[175:18.14]Interested?
[175:19.24]Right.

[180:19.20]Oh, this is too cool.

[180:22.94]I want casual.
[180:30.45]Alright, that's alright.
[180:33.90]Not cool.
[180:39.80]Glasses, yeah.
[180:40.54]Alright, we need glasses.
[180:46.64]What about legs?
[180:50.07]Drop leg wear.
[180:51.35]No, it's all this... This is dumb.
[180:53.23]I don't want this.
[180:53.71]Fine.
[180:56.17]Okay.
[181:01.03]Uh, we need... We got innerwear.

[181:42.14]Zoomer boomer.
[181:46.06]No, yeah.
[181:46.86]This is in every one of those movies where the 15-year-old switches brains with the 50-year-old.
[181:55.12]And then as the 13-year-old 50-year-old, they dress like this.
[182:04.66]And then they use some crazy teen lingo when they're ordering a coffee and everybody looks around, they're like, yeah, I'll take a double shot of that and it's going to be lit.
[182:12.20]And everyone around is like, what the old lady said that?
[182:15.51]That's strange.
[182:32.90]Wait, isn't this the same guy?
[182:34.68]This is the same people from last time.
[182:46.09]Wait, play darts.
[182:49.07]That's not what I wanted to do.
[182:51.43]That's not what I wanted to do.
[183:01.25]Let's play darts.
[183:01.89]No, take the mask off.
[183:03.33]Okay, I clicked.
[183:07.30]I didn't mean to click.
[183:08.16]Let's play darts.
[183:15.68]I have no idea how to play darts and I don't even care to read this.
[183:21.80]I'll just get into the middle.
[183:29.02]Aim, throw.
[183:43.15]fuck this people are pissing their pants?
[184:03.54]that's a double bull

[184:25.53]Oh, no.
[184:32.09]No, no, no.
[184:32.63]Everybody run.
[184:33.37]Fucking shot.
[184:54.43]It's gonna have a gun in my hand!
[185:02.43]I win!
[185:26.16]Gun.
[185:27.22]Look out.
[185:28.00]Gun.
[185:29.46]She's got a gun.
[185:47.48]What was that?
[185:47.98]Was it Nathan Drake over there?
[185:49.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[186:03.11]This guy keeps pissing his pants.
[186:11.33]Okay, get me the fuck out of here.
[186:26.56]Who's talking shit?
[186:45.79]Hard mode, I win.
[186:46.49]Alright, so now... Let's go do this mission.
[187:00.51]Where's the gambling?
[187:01.29]I don't think there's gambling in this game.
[187:05.63]That was pretty sick.
[187:12.43]Realistic old lady driving?
[187:15.67]No, it's not.
[187:19.88]Now it is.
[187:35.72]That's a broken back.
[187:37.42]Holy shit.
[187:38.18]That was horrible.
[187:39.82]She's fine.
[187:40.42]She's alright.
[187:41.98]She's still got a little bit of spunk.
[187:46.96]Crunch.
[187:51.25]Uh, what are you doing?
[187:53.73]No, what are you doing?
[187:54.97]Get on the bike.
[187:57.91]He's confused.
[188:04.86]That's a shattered hip.
[188:14.28]Oh, my stomach.
[188:18.88]I can't stop thinking about the darts.
[188:20.26]These are GTA 3 tier jokes.
[188:27.86]I mean, is it jokes or am I just... Is this game just fucking...
[188:39.21]Shit.
[188:40.09]Fuck.
[188:43.90]This is Red Dead all over again.
[188:45.92]What are you doing?
[188:49.32]Come on, dude.
[188:56.71]What the fuck?
[189:00.29]Get off.
[189:14.94]City is fighting back.
[189:30.21]I'm here.
[189:31.07]In theory, the AR reconstruction... Wait.
[189:33.37]Oh, I'm getting super deja vu.
[189:36.53]I was here already with a different person.
[189:38.51]And I can scrape all the metadata for this area.
[189:48.01]Okay, let's go in here.
[189:48.91]Alright, Granny's ready to go.
[189:58.91]Investigate the AR tech.
[190:11.04]Security lasers will alert guards.
[190:12.56]Disable them by hacking them.
[190:21.98]Alright, how do I... I need to hack them.
[190:23.36]Is there a camera?
[190:27.73]Hack.
[190:33.19]Alright, mask on.
[190:40.48]Pile this shit up.
[190:43.84]Now what?
[190:48.84]Launch AR reconstruction test.
[190:53.80]How the fuck do I do that?
[190:59.74]Wait, is this a trap door?
[191:00.68]Can I, like, trap somebody in there?
[191:03.23]Wait, can I... I can't, like, pancake throw him or anything, can I?
[191:18.16]I guess.
[191:19.00]Alright.
[191:20.76]Oh, fuck!
[191:21.22]There's a guy right there.
[191:34.08]Do it!
[191:34.26]Cool.
[191:34.38]Nobody suspects the old lady.
[191:48.44]Oh, diaper.
[191:48.90]Are you going to raid?
[191:50.47]Oh, this Ludwig.
[191:50.93]Ludwig raid.
[191:51.25]What's going on, everybody?
[191:51.93]Thanks, Ludwig.
[191:53.09]Hope you had a good stream today.
[192:15.15]Today we're playing a game that I... I'm so glad you raided now and not like three hours ago when I had to update my graphics drivers like three times.
[192:24.60]This game... I... By the way, I might make this really clear to everybody.
[192:28.24]My game... My computer sucks and I can't run this fucking shitty game.
[192:31.24]Well, the game's not shitty.
[192:32.38]Maybe it is.
[192:36.89]This is a fucking huge raid, by the way.
[192:40.05]This is a lot of people.
[192:44.53]15k.
[192:44.87]Holy shit, Ludwig.
[192:47.79]If you guys don't follow Ludwig, he's one of the funniest people on Twitch.
[192:52.19]He's like a content king.
[192:53.57]He's got it going on.
[192:54.41]Trust me.
[193:02.20]Freudian slip.
[193:03.14]Alright.
[193:03.94]Let me get back to what I was doing.
[193:06.24]Oh, by the way.
[193:07.02]I know that Ludwig says he can beat me in a fight.
[193:11.25]It depends.
[193:11.71]Are we allowed to bring weapons?
[193:19.34]25k a- oh shit, hold on, there's people here.
[193:24.27]Oh no, no, no, no.
[193:28.45]Anybody hear this?
[193:35.39]Uh... I'm pushing him back into his spawn.
[193:45.74]Where am I?
[193:46.84]I don't like it in the dark.
[193:47.90]Oh, shit.
[193:51.02]Yeah, this is Mike.
[193:52.28]I happen to be, I think somebody locked me in a freezer.
[193:58.64]What, wipe his nose?
[194:02.63]Get, get the fuck out here and let me end this.
[194:14.71]What the hell did I... Okay, we got him.
[194:23.86]He's dead.

[194:28.64]Escape?
[194:31.83]Oh, shit.

[194:38.55]Give me the shotgun.
[194:46.74]I just have to leave.

[202:51.94]This way?
[202:54.91]That's cool.
[202:55.33]Sounds pretty cool.
[202:56.03]Out of range?
[203:17.49]I can't, uh, wait, what?
[203:21.29]I can't hack it.
[203:26.14]I have to actually be in there?

[203:57.65]Hold on.
[203:58.51]Uh... Come over here.
[204:05.37]Why do they keep making these?
[204:06.41]I'm just going to the car.
[204:28.49]Fuck it.
[204:29.15]We're just going in.
[204:43.61]Are you still alive?
[205:01.27]Pack it.
[205:01.57]Alright, now hide.
[205:15.05]Yoohoo?
[205:17.35]Yoohoo!
[205:28.58]Who says yoohoo in a situation where people are shooting at you with a gun?
[205:31.22]Alright, I gotta get out.
[205:48.32]Just walk.
[205:55.09]Yoohoo grillers?
[206:04.13]We got it.
[206:05.09]We did it.
[206:05.66]Hooray!
[206:06.38]Sick.
[206:14.50]Good news, dear.
[206:15.66]We erased your debt with Clan Kelly.
[206:18.21]You're free, and those gangsters can kindly fuck off.
[206:25.83]Please, Zimmer, it's not funny anymore.
[206:27.13]This game sucks ass.
[206:30.75]Ray, relax.
[206:31.75]Relax, dude.
[206:32.69]Okay.
[206:33.57]Don't shrew that.
[206:37.07]Shrew.
[206:37.91]Don't shrew that.
[206:45.36]Wow.
[206:59.87]True.
[207:00.41]What the fuck was that?
[207:08.13]It was an explosion.
[207:38.75]Just say, bro.
[207:42.61]Bro.
[207:43.97]Bro, you need to... Dude, come on.
[207:45.85]All units, possible suspect or suspects, report in to my location.
[207:55.71]Message received, moving in, over.
[208:00.43]Gee, I'm still alive.
[208:13.70]You zuck at driving?
[208:23.89]It's that easy to get away from the cops in this game.
[208:25.47]You just hold W. Where am I?
[208:43.90]Wrong side?
[208:45.02]Of course.
[208:45.36]Hey, let me get in this, uh, Zaxxy.
[209:11.77]This game sucks.
[209:12.65]Go Zerk off.
[209:17.83]You know, not the second part, but... Mom, the streamers told me to suck off.
[209:24.03]Dark times indeed.
[209:50.44]The tooth?
[209:51.70]Oh, it's a... Technically, yeah.
[209:54.66]It's a Bluetooth.
[209:55.32]I can't believe that Ubisoft was able to make this happen.
[210:14.72]This is what, 60 million people that live in London?
[210:18.52]60 million different voice actors?
[210:20.52]That's kind of unbelievable.
[210:22.16]That's crazy.
[210:27.04]It's definitely not 12 people... pasted over every single person you get.
[210:37.47]Welcome to the Resistance.
[210:43.93]No, it's just Nolan North.
[210:45.67]He's every single character.
[210:47.53]That's funny.
[210:49.39]Every single one.
[210:50.59]Even the old lady.
[210:51.85]It's just Nolan North.
[210:53.07]Okay, go to the... There's a heist.
[211:17.28]What?
[211:17.46]No, I don't want to start this mission.
[211:18.74]Bare Knuckle League?
[211:19.66]Oops.
[211:19.88]Look at my team.
[211:20.46]I don't care about any of these team members.
[211:22.24]Just don't.
[211:52.28]Do it with granny?
[211:52.96]Let me just do this first.
[212:03.97]You can't do it with granny?
[212:04.99]Aw, that's too bad.
[212:05.57]Is this illegal?
[212:09.97]I guess, yeah, pretty illegal.
[212:13.41]Character wheel.
[212:15.83]And summon the cargo drone.
[212:18.27]It's out of reach, so you'll need to use a heavy cargo drone to steal it.
[212:37.89]Where is it?
[212:38.23]Do I have to be out of the car?
[212:43.65]Oh, right.
[212:45.17]Climb onto a cargo drone and hijack it.
[213:04.89]Where is it?
[213:05.29]Did this guy run over it?
[213:14.26]Oh!
[213:14.34]Hi.
[213:14.80]Alright, let's go steal the server.
[213:27.73]I have a question.

[213:30.57]Because they really fucking love this.
[213:34.31]Losing signal.
[213:35.17]What?
[213:41.20]Um.

[213:47.42]Can I drive or get on it?
[213:49.65]Get on it?
[213:51.57]Get on it, they say.
[213:53.63]Get on it?
[213:55.33]What the fuck?
[213:58.02]Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

[215:58.04]Watch Dogs 3.
[215:58.38]Not even Watch Dogs 3.
[215:59.24]This is Watch Dogs 2 with a different story and different characters to play as.
[216:02.60]Not Watch Dogs 3.
[216:03.32]It was, but they didn't number it.
[216:04.60]Oh.
[216:30.52]Use me!
[216:31.10]Okay, if the gra- If the gra- Alright, if you were watching Shroud's stream right now, and the graphics weren't as bad as they are on my stream.

[217:11.55]Number four?
[217:21.25]What?
[217:29.45]Fourth place.
[217:30.53]It's okay.
[217:30.97]I still get two points in Mario Kart.
[217:36.37]Hack in more viewers.
[217:37.55]No, I'm kidding.
[217:51.38]What the fuck did I just do?
[217:53.38]What happened?
[217:54.38]What did I just punch?
[217:55.98]What was that?
[217:56.94]Was that a drone?
[217:57.82]Okay.
[217:58.16]Let's go.
[217:58.48]I kind of started to like Justin now.
[218:25.11]What else does he have?
[218:28.00]He's got loyalty card.
[218:40.42]Put on a facecam, you'll get more views.
[218:42.42]No, it's alright.
[218:43.92]It's okay.
[218:46.86]It's fine.
[218:47.30]It's fine.
[218:54.42]Why go all the way around when you can just go like this?
[219:08.47]He's naked?
[219:08.97]Yes he is.
[219:11.65]I do not have a shirt on, you're right.
[219:19.22]I never stream with clothes on.
[219:21.26]You are accurate.
[219:34.37]It's just been painted.
[219:35.39]I paint my clothes on?
[219:41.20]It was an old SNL skit.
[219:43.06]From 25 years ago.
[219:45.52]About shirt in a can.
[219:47.64]And it's pretty funny.
[219:51.76]They have, uh... Somebody sprays it on him.
[219:53.99]It's like, oh, shirt in a can!
[219:55.01]And they spray it all over their body.
[219:56.19]And the guy starts going, it's burning my skin!
[219:58.29]And I thought it was really funny.
[220:09.08]Boomer humor.
[220:16.88]So?
[220:17.16]This mission sucks.
[220:25.00]Do I have to protect this?
[220:26.02]Alright.
[220:35.32]They love the drones.
[220:36.04]They love drones so much in this game.
[220:38.16]It's like their favorite thing ever.
[221:10.42]I know, whatever.
[221:11.30]NA aim.
[221:12.60]NA 25 FPS aim.
[221:15.25]I'm losing DPI on every move.
[221:37.65]This was better when it didn't work and when you were having trouble.
[221:43.01]Really?
[221:43.29]What, now that the game works, it's just the game now?
[221:47.75]True?
[221:48.65]Oh, come on.
[221:51.01]What, you don't want me to watch a loading bar while I shoot drones?
[221:53.87]Oh, CB, CBD?
[222:08.01]I destroyed both the server and the drones.
[222:10.11]So, you know, run.
[222:16.34]Go, please.
[222:24.02]Well, that was fun, wasn't it?
[222:25.66]We pulled off a heist, made life a bit harder for the tyrants of the world, and most importantly, I got a new toy to play with.
[222:31.66]Now, run along back to the safe house.
[222:33.32]All right, I did it.
[222:34.06]See you and your new teammates for a briefing.
[222:41.72]Wait, he doesn't put his bare asshole in his computer chair, right?
[222:44.56]Why?
[222:45.06]Why do you think I put my... Would that to be a thing that was possible?
[223:00.47]I don't have to do the whole mission, right?
[223:04.33]No, I don't.
[223:07.99]You want me to be placing my asshole into the gamer chair?
[223:14.81]Permadeath.
[223:15.41]No, you have to unlock Permadeath.
[223:28.17]No, that's not made up.
[223:28.83]You actually do.
[223:29.27]Alright, let's teleport.
[223:38.69]It activates after this mission.
[223:40.28]Alright, sounds cool.
[223:49.26]Alright, let's tip.
[223:49.78]Ooh, look!
[223:50.54]There she is.
[223:50.94]Triple A video game stream.
[224:05.25]Team, it's good to see the safe house filling up again.
[224:09.31]The only way we're going to keep London from falling into total oppression is by rebuilding the resistance.
[224:15.55]Recruit, train, build back our arsenal.
[224:19.81]The people are itching to rise up and take their city back.
[224:24.47]We just need to show them that DedSec are fighting along with them.
[224:28.96]There's only two of us?
[224:31.04]Who the fuck is that?
[224:31.94]Did we get a random person because I didn't recruit enough people?
[224:34.88]It's the construction worker.
[224:36.66]Okay, okay, okay.
[224:58.86]I'd say that's a full docket.
[225:00.76]Enough talk.
[225:02.16]Let's unfuck London.
[225:06.00]Killed the other two?
[225:07.55]Oh shit, that's right.
[225:09.03]We had five and I ran two of them over the car.
[225:11.11]You're right.
[225:11.49]Armored Death is now active.
[225:16.07]Okay, now if everyone dies, the game ends.
[225:22.76]I only have three people.
[225:32.38]What do I got for missions?
[225:34.36]Okay.
[225:34.89]Answer the call.
[225:43.56]Mission digging up the path.
[225:44.50]Alright, let's go with our queen here.
[225:50.35]I found a lead that may help us unravel more about Zero Day and the bombings we ate shit for.
[225:55.49]I've picked up an encrypted signal from the tone conference site that's been broadcast.
[225:58.68]There's our queen.
[226:01.12]Yes, queen.
[226:02.08]You might even get to try out that fancy new AR tech we stole.
[226:04.96]Yes.
[226:05.64]Creatively shared.
[226:06.76]Stop.
[226:08.02]Stop, chat.
[226:08.64]Stop.
[226:08.80]All right, let's go.
[226:15.27]Team.
[226:16.45]We have to recruit a couple more people.
[226:17.85]13 minutes?
[226:18.75]What does that mean?
[226:21.61]Potential recruits.
[226:22.45]But aren't these people dead?
[226:23.37]Well, they dislike DedSec because I've killed them.
[226:35.32]Alright, let's do it.
[226:38.57]How do I... Oh, gee.
[226:39.85]Weapons?
[226:49.22]Weapons?
[226:52.06]Oh, shut up.
[226:52.58]Don't tell me what to do.
[226:53.54]Alright, we got some new shit here.
[226:55.02]How many points do I have?
[226:56.04]I have 30 points.
[226:56.78]What should we give to... What is this?
[226:58.64]Deep Profiler.
[227:00.16]Electro Fist.
[227:02.77]Grenade Launcher.
[227:19.62]Or a shotgun.
[227:21.28]A non-lethal shotgun.
[227:28.50]The grenade launcher, are you serious?
[227:35.24]How do I equip these?
[227:42.73]Wait, did you say this is a non-lethal grenade launcher?
[227:51.32]Oh.
[227:52.71]Ow.
[227:54.17]Is it full of fireworks?
[227:55.39]Alright.
[228:00.02]Find the signal source at the tone attack site.
[228:03.46]Is the video in the menu?
[228:14.93]Okay, where is it?
[228:16.63]Store, data, team.
[228:18.87]Oh, edit.
[228:19.27]Here we go.
[228:19.49]Okay, weapons.
[228:23.93]Grenade launcher.
[228:26.83]And pistol.
[228:29.63]Yeah, please.
[228:30.17]Thank you.
[228:36.46]Can I not equip this?
[228:39.18]It is equipped.
[228:48.83]I have two slots.
[228:53.03]Alright, let's move.
[229:05.19]His brain?
[229:05.77]I wasn't even looking.
[229:13.77]Wait, what is this?
[229:21.53]We just have a keg down here?
[229:23.01]Take another one.
[229:31.27]Wow, granny, one beer.
[229:34.11]One beer, granny.
[229:35.23]What do you think I drink?
[229:46.90]And why does the beer have acid in it?
[229:50.54]He cuts my head.
[229:53.84]Why is it a different voice actor?
[230:01.13]Finally a proper drink.
[230:22.54]Alright, let's go.
[230:23.08]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[230:39.48]It's just a filter?
[230:40.79]Yeah, World of Warcraft did this 30 years ago.
[230:44.17]Wait, I think this is a... Should I buy new clothes?
[230:52.03]You can't jump over that.
[230:56.89]And why is it when you get drunk, music plays in your head?
[230:59.17]I can't.
[231:11.88]I'm just teleporting the fuck out of here.
[231:21.36]can't can I new clothes ah teleport to desktop god damn it why why buy clothes from a proper store
[231:58.69]Still drunk?
[231:59.37]Yeah, I drank like seven beers in 30 seconds.
[232:03.82]Oh, that horrible view.
[232:26.65]The game looks better now.
[232:28.59]Fuck, it probably does.
[232:32.87]Can I... Can I get in the taxi?
[232:36.11]Can the taxi take me somewhere?
[232:38.03]I don't want to do this.
[232:46.30]Auto drive.
[232:46.82]Alright, we're good.
[233:04.83]Oh, that looks like shit.
[233:13.78]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[233:22.48]People saying, oh, this is going to be cool in the future.
[233:30.67]I feel like self-driving cars are at the stage right now where VR was 15 years ago.
[233:39.46]Where the Virtual Boy was cool, but it hurt and it was not ready.
[233:56.02]People are like, oh yeah, we're going to have self-driving cars.
[233:58.14]We're going to be in those self-driving cars.
[233:59.48]You're going to be going to work just looking at your watch while the car drives you to work.
[234:03.34]I think that's like a hundred years from now.
[234:04.88]You know how many roads have to be completely redone in America?
[234:14.45]Think about every road that needs to be repainted.
[234:30.09]That's not how it works.
[234:30.83]Doesn't it read the lines on the road with like a scanner?
[234:35.83]Or does it just say there's other cars around me?
[234:38.14]Be careful.
[234:48.28]It uses cameras.
[234:52.85]motion sense cameras?
[235:00.01]Tesla already does it.
[235:00.87]Yeah, but don't Teslas only do it if you're going like 60 on the highway and you're like staring straight because... It uses human brains.
[235:24.45]But you guys don't know what Elon Musk has been... I'm talking, be quiet.
[235:29.99]What Elon Musk didn't tell you guys is it's just... It's just people driving the car with a remote control.
[235:36.10]When you press the button, somebody's like, oh shit!
[235:38.04]Okay, my turn.
[235:39.46]In a giant center, like call center.
[235:40.78]Okay, find the signal source at the attack site.
[235:52.22]Okay, sure.
[235:56.66]This is the worst fucking character to be right now.
[236:02.83]That's just in Guardians of the Galaxy.
[236:04.27]Thanks for the spoiler!
[236:05.11]I've never seen that movie!
[236:16.27]Need a key?
[236:16.67]Alright.
[236:19.12]Find the signal source at the attack site.
[236:21.00]Let's go.
[236:25.13]Who gives a fuck, Omega Lull?
[236:27.75]And when I talked about, like, Season 1 of Game of Thrones two months ago, people were like, hey!
[236:33.68]Hey!
[236:35.24]Don't say that!
[236:38.36]I can't, what, all of a sudden somebody says, like, Guardians of the Galaxy?
[236:40.66]Is this what happens at the end of the movie?
[236:42.27]And I can't go, hey.
[236:43.05]I don't think this character can do this mission.
[236:56.79]Not over the razor wire, granny.
[237:00.01]Oh, there it is.
[237:00.41]Oh, okay.
[237:10.46]I'm in.
[237:18.77]Ooh, I need that.
[237:19.35]I need to hijack that.
[237:26.95]Okay.
[237:27.73]Losing signal.
[237:29.01]What?
[237:30.73]No, I'm right there.
[237:31.53]I'm right there.
[237:31.93]Alright, this is the source of the power right here.
[237:41.25]Granny on it?
[237:41.85]I don't think Granny... Can Granny go on it?
[238:03.95]I guess so.
[238:04.45]Okay.
[238:13.53]Permateth is on.
[238:14.67]You're right.
[238:15.95]Why did I need to go?
[238:17.05]Why did I have to pick her up?
[238:20.37]Can I just go in here?
[238:21.19]Found the source.
[238:24.43]Okay.
[238:30.18]I found it.
[238:36.07]source of the power this is a damaged spider bot leg what the fuck are you serious guys this is it the signal is coming from this spider got fragment no indication yet who it belongs to good god it's been torn asunder
[238:55.83]What is it doing here?
[238:57.78]Difficult to say, but with an AR reconstruction, we may be able to see what happened to it and if it relates to the attack.
[239:04.18]70% of people want to see you play a different game.
[239:05.70]Well, make sure you show up to the stream tomorrow.
[239:08.76]We're playing Little Hope.
[239:09.86]Me and Italics are going to do Little Hope co-op.
[239:12.58]Man of Medan anthology series.
[239:16.66]That should be fun.
[239:18.87]Okay, access the surveillance data.

[240:24.00]Who's behind me?
[240:25.64]What's going on?
[240:26.22]There's nobody behind me.
[240:26.86]Who's behind me?
[240:28.63]Get out!
[240:28.89]Get out!
[240:29.17]Granny, get out!
[240:29.79]Alright, don't matter.
[240:57.82]Swap to a new operative.
[240:59.26]I just did.
[240:59.78]Don't worry, German.
[241:05.15]The game will be ending in five minutes.
[241:06.91]She fell off a fucking drone.
[241:14.93]What the hell?
[241:28.48]What a way to go.
[241:29.30]That wasn't illegal.
[241:31.35]It was just stupid.
[241:33.49]I think I'm done with this game.
[241:35.41]I think I'm done.
[241:36.27]It's alright.
[241:37.13]It's alright.
[241:38.01]But, like, I don't know.
[241:38.75]I don't think I'm done.
[241:39.83]I don't think I'm done with it.
[241:57.20]Let me try one more time.
[241:59.42]The missions are kind of boring.
[242:00.74]Okay, let's go over here.
[242:18.31]Not even three hours?
[242:19.69]No, it was like four and a half.
[242:24.49]I don't want to drive over that.
[242:45.87]I'm fucking outta here!
[242:47.61]I don't- Every mission's like in like a fucking box!
[242:59.74]Get me in!
[243:02.87]He's alive!
[243:04.25]It's okay!
[243:05.21]He's alive!
[243:06.25]Every mission's in a square box surrounded by fucking walls!
[243:14.61]I know, you have to hack and like, I don't, I'm not a strategy guy.
[243:18.55]Hey.
[243:19.85]Come in here and open up this door for me.
[243:23.70]Get a game over.
[243:27.24]You know what?
[243:27.72]Fuck it.
[243:39.15]This is where it was.
[243:52.14]I- Unfu- Okay.
[243:55.08]Don't buy this game.
[244:07.85]Your PC sucks.
[244:18.57]That's true, alright?
[244:19.81]It's true.
[244:20.37]My PC does suck.
[244:23.37]What's going on with this ever-increasing computer power that you need to play new video games?
[244:28.27]My computer's only four years old.
[244:29.55]He's actually upset.
[244:43.67]I am not actually upset.
[244:45.53]I'm not even mad.
[244:46.45]I'm not mad.
[244:52.62]That was worst stream 2020?
[244:55.92]It's not my fault.
[244:58.02]Don't blame me.
[244:58.54]No, it's not.
[245:04.93]It's not my fault.
[245:07.87]Worse than Skate 3.
[245:08.71]Skate 3 actually worked.
[245:19.01]You chose this game.
[245:20.31]I know.
[245:20.67]I was like, oh, Watch Dogs Legion, man.
[245:22.63]They can, like, be anybody.
[245:24.09]I got grabbed by the marketing pamphlet.
[245:26.14]They got me.
[245:27.32]They got me.
[245:35.22]You're an idiot.
[245:36.12]No, that's a cool concept.
[245:37.96]You can play as anybody, but I should have known.
[245:47.98]Let's do a tier list.
[245:48.78]Alright, we'll do one tier list.
[246:00.92]What do you got?
[246:02.41]Maybe, maybe more than one.
[246:05.21]Germa Meltdown Stream tier list?
[246:11.61]Wait.
[246:17.98]Alright, I'll do this one.
[246:23.42]Hold on, what else we got?
[246:25.56]Let me go pee.
[246:26.10]I'll come back.
[246:26.48]We'll do a couple of these.
[246:31.00]The Encyclopedia of Sandwiches.
[246:35.72]Seems interesting.
[246:41.74]Okay, I'm into this one.
[246:45.41]Uh, every Pokemon ever, I don't, I can't, I couldn't name you one Pokemon if I tried.
[246:52.06]Artificial fruit flavors.
[246:54.34]Alright, that sounds interesting.
[246:55.36]You got me.
[246:58.40]Lisa the painful party members.
[246:59.88]I never played it.
[247:09.58]What else you got?
[247:13.09]Alright, we'll do these.
[247:14.17]We'll do these.
[247:17.65]Ubisoft games?
[247:20.11]There's an Ubisoft games tier list?
[247:25.47]Okay, I don't think I even need to do this.
[247:27.43]Rayman is S tier and everything else is D. Oh, wait, hold on.
[247:38.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[247:40.17]Hold on.
[247:40.39]I don't know if this is a fair list.
[247:42.38]This is not Ubisoft developed games.
[247:46.01]No More Heroes is on here.
[247:47.69]They didn't make that game.
[247:50.81]I'll do it.
[247:51.30]Sure.
[247:51.46]Alright.
[247:53.10]Let me just take a quick pee break.
[247:54.06]I'll be right back.
[247:54.52]We'll do this.
[247:55.48]And I gotta put a shirt on too.
[247:57.40]Give me a sec.
