[00:01.53]All right, so we're going to switch to Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.
[00:07.39]Don't have a drink like more than one cup of coffee in an hour because you're just going to end up peeing every fucking 10 seconds.
[00:13.02]It's actually kind of irritating.
[00:14.56]Like, how come?
[00:15.20]Where's my like better bladder?
[00:17.82]Okay, let's open it.
[00:20.02]Please watch your ears, by the way.
[00:22.28]Your ears are about to hear something loud.
[00:28.41]I'm warning you.
[00:29.25]Here's the warning.
[00:29.99]It's probably going to happen.
[00:32.13]Be careful.
[00:33.23]Here it comes.
[00:39.31]It's actually not bad.
[00:40.37]It's okay.
[00:46.90]There it is.
[00:47.34]Uh-huh.
[00:50.40]Uh-huh.
[00:50.56]Okay.
[00:52.34]Ultimate.
[00:54.26]Ultimate.
[00:55.65]Epic Battle Simulator.
[00:56.57]We played this four or five days ago on Thursday's stream.
[01:08.08]There we go.
[01:10.00]The only difference is this stream actually is still going.
[01:12.83]You can actually hear what the hell is going on.
[01:18.81]So... Let's go here.
[01:24.69]I have Tommy, Timmy, and Timby.
[01:27.33]Whatever we're gonna do.
[01:29.11]I want, like, another good fight, though.
[01:31.95]We ain't gonna do just, like... Guys, this ain't gonna be just, like, a Chuck Norris versus a Chuck Norris.
[01:37.85]Ha ha!
[01:39.26]No.
[01:40.84]I actually wanna, like, think of, like, an interesting battle.
[01:47.24]So, in the meantime, move that.
[01:48.52]Uh-huh.
[01:50.36]Okay.
[01:51.84]So...
[01:54.36]Fantasy.
[01:57.02]Medieval.
[02:00.02]Heroes.
[02:00.60]Golden Knight.
[02:01.26]No Chuck Norris.
[02:02.22]We're going to go with Ancient Greece.
[02:04.92]It's going to be the Romans.
[02:08.75]Let's go with 1,000 Romans.
[02:14.87]Here.
[02:15.23]I like this.
[02:17.93]City of the Lost Crusades.
[02:19.05]There'll be an attacking team and a defending team.
[02:23.68]Let's just put them here.
[02:24.64]Hopefully, I hope they can fit in here.
[02:27.16]Thousand Romans.
[02:29.40]This is team one.
[02:30.14]They're going to be on defend.
[02:31.48]Hold position.
[02:32.06]Let's go with, like, one.
[02:34.88]No, like, point, like, five.
[02:36.84]No.
[02:38.72]Two.
[02:39.48]No, one.
[02:40.16]That's okay.
[02:41.34]Hopefully, they can fit in here.
[02:43.64]So, the whole goal here is that there's going to be, the king is going to be right here.
[02:47.82]So, let's just get him out there.
[02:48.98]Team one.
[02:54.09]Animals.
[02:54.97]Should it just be the animals versus... Should it be like a fucking bunch of animals?
[03:02.51]No.
[03:03.47]No, no, no, no.
[03:05.70]We're going back to... Greece.
[03:09.36]Spartans.
[03:09.94]We have... We're gonna have two sets of Romans.
[03:13.82]On the same team.
[03:15.22]They'll be up here.
[03:18.72]Spin them this way.
[03:21.21]It's all we have... No, it's gonna be like...
[03:24.33]It's going to be like 1 p.m.
[03:25.47]So we can actually see what the hell is going on.
[03:31.41]Right here.
[03:34.03]That's fine.
[03:34.71]We'll do 1,000 of these guys.
[03:37.67]I wonder if they can even do it.
[03:43.09]Fantasy.
[03:43.85]No.
[03:45.53]Ancient Greece.
[03:46.29]Now we'll put on some Spartans.
[03:47.37]The Spartans are going to be on team 1-2 as well.
[03:52.64]The Spartans are going to be the most coveted of all the Romans, right?
[03:56.10]What was that movie?
[03:58.50]Yeah, like the... Haha, 300.
[04:01.68]There's going to be 300 Spartans.
[04:07.67]Ha!
[04:12.37]And they'll be right here to protect.
[04:14.45]This is the last bastion right there.
[04:19.37]Heavy knight, footman.
[04:20.29]No, we need a hero.
[04:21.75]Golden knight.
[04:24.27]One golden knight.
[04:25.67]You kill the king, you win.
[04:33.28]What a good joke.
[04:36.72]That's fine right there.
[04:38.50]That's the king.
[04:39.06]That's the real king, right?
[04:42.10]So... Let's do one more team.
[04:49.61]One more.
[04:51.69]Ancient Greece did this this is the real that we're gonna have like a bunch of What is wild man, what does that mean?
[05:02.17]We're gonna have like 2,000 wild men apparently Put them like here.
[05:11.97]I'll just be hanging out right there.
[05:13.19]All right now the net this other team team two Team two is gonna have to be
[05:23.65]Uh, I don't want to do orcs again.
[05:24.65]Heroes, medieval.
[05:27.55]No.
[05:30.60]Evil.
[05:32.10]It's only zombies?
[05:32.96]Come on, there's gonna be more than that.
[05:37.66]No US soldiers.
[05:41.94]We could just do animals, but like, that's like... We did that last time.
[05:45.96]I want an actual fucking battle.
[05:48.06]We're gonna just go with medieval.
[05:51.64]Let's go back to the ore.
[05:52.42]The orcs are very easy to play with.
[05:55.16]So 10,000 orcs are going to come from here.
[05:59.94]We got to do hold position.
[06:02.36]Hold position.
[06:03.06]Hold position.
[06:04.60]Hold position.
[06:05.40]Okay.
[06:05.78]Attack.
[06:06.91]10,000 orcs.
[06:09.01]No.
[06:09.49]That's way too many.
[06:10.15]6,000 orcs.
[06:10.77]Team 2.
[06:17.37]Let's do another thing of orcs here.
[06:19.13]That come in through the other side here.
[06:26.30]We'll go with 4,000 and 4,000.
[06:28.56]No, that's way too many.
[06:33.98]What was this before?
[06:36.52]3,000?
[06:36.54]No.
[06:36.96]Okay.
[06:38.44]3,000 wild men.
[06:42.31]Make sure the armies aren't skewed in any real bad way.
[06:47.69]There we go.
[06:48.63]And these are on attack and attack.
[06:51.17]And then, of course, we need to have another... I, like, did this joke already.
[07:05.38]Where the hell even are they?
[07:07.20]Where'd they go?
[07:08.98]Oh, they're over here.
[07:13.48]No, we're not doing a joke yet.
[07:15.04]I want to actually have, like, a battle.
[07:17.29]Giant ogres, like 20 of them.
[07:21.13]And they're going to come from this side.
[07:26.63]There we go.
[07:27.49]Okay.
[07:28.65]Team two, we got it.
[07:29.57]All right.
[07:30.35]So we got, they're flanking.
[07:31.47]You have to kill the king in the middle.
[07:36.19]That's fine.
[07:37.71]All right.
[07:37.99]Let's do it.
[07:39.95]Go kill the king.
[07:40.89]That's what the goal is.
[07:46.53]Good luck to you.
[07:47.61]It's probably going to take a while.
[07:49.52]Where's my coffee?
[07:52.30]Mostly sunny?
[07:54.78]How we doing?
[07:55.50]Did the unit... Can the units actually even load in here?
[07:58.64]In this fucking maze?
[08:06.87]Okay, there's a shitload of the orcs.
[08:09.51]Cool.
[08:10.93]Huh.
[08:13.34]Okay, that doesn't seem to look right.
[08:16.06]And where we go, this is the last bastion, right?
[08:19.04]Where's the king?
[08:22.92]Where's the king?
[08:27.00]Why did the king get replaced by... Is the king here?
[08:33.06]I don't think the king is here.
[08:45.85]He didn't make it.
[08:50.10]It's alright.
[08:50.56]Let's see.
[08:52.46]This looks like shit.
[08:57.52]Why are these guys not attacking?
[09:02.00]Well, the king didn't even show up.
[09:03.26]That's okay.
[09:07.79]I don't think this is gonna work.
[09:11.05]King called in sick today.
[09:12.37]Yeah, apparently.
[09:16.28]Well, that's fine.
[09:17.64]We can start it over, don't worry.
[09:21.04]Cause we're just gonna drop a fucking NUCLEAR BOMB!
[09:22.76]Is that it?
[09:32.73]Is that it?
[09:33.45]No, no, it's still... It's still... It's still these guys.
[09:39.92]Oh well.
[09:47.84]What was the point of that, by the way?
[09:49.56]Alright.
[09:53.78]So, I fucked up something.
[09:57.56]$200 joke.
[09:57.84]No, I just wanted to see what it did.
[09:58.94]Okay, so something went wrong.
[10:03.55]Why... He couldn't just spawn in here.
[10:05.55]That's stupid.
[10:09.31]Good joke.
[10:09.81]I wasn't even making a joke.
[10:10.79]I was making an observation.
[10:14.95]I'm just gonna make everybody attack.
[10:16.01]Like, the whole position thing sucks.
[10:19.78]You know what I mean?
[10:20.42]That shit is just dumb.
[10:22.84]Everyone's gonna fight.
[10:24.42]Let's turn these guys this way.
[10:28.52]Move these guys here.
[10:29.70]Move these guys here.
[10:32.44]There.
[10:35.94]That's a little bit better.
[10:37.90]Yeah, I like that better.
[10:38.82]Alright, here we go.
[10:40.16]Start battle.
[10:48.04]Is everybody going to spawn in this time?
[10:49.20]Or are people going to get stuck in walls?
[10:52.58]It's very important.
[10:59.87]Type louder?
[11:03.19]There we go.
[11:03.69]Okay, finally.
[11:07.56]He's hiding behind the pillar, so he's good.
[11:10.08]We are ready to start the battle.
[11:13.12]Start battle.
[11:17.59]What are you... He's on a different fucking team, isn't he?
[11:25.24]Yeah.
[11:27.38]Okay, well there was a mutiny and the king died.
[11:29.02]Okay.
[11:38.09]Apparently there was a mutiny.
[11:40.43]It was just treason.
[11:41.35]They were waiting.
[11:43.21]Oh my fucking god.
[11:44.17]Who cares?
[11:44.49]Who cares?
[11:44.95]Who cares?
[11:49.61]That doesn't matter.
[11:50.23]I don't even like this map anyways.
[11:51.53]I like the other one better.
[11:52.35]Yeah, I don't like this.
[11:56.27]I don't like this!
[12:04.33]Let's go to the other map.
[12:13.63]Alright, here's my beef.
[12:15.58]I feel like last stream we did all the things we could do.
[12:19.40]So now I'm just kind of like, drop nukes on people, isn't that funny?
[12:24.07]The last stream I played this for like an hour or two.
[12:26.03]And I think I did everything I could do.
[12:28.75]And now I'm just like reaching at this point.
[12:30.51]Like, hey, let's just drop nukes again.
[12:37.53]So, with that being said, we're just going to do something stupid.
[12:40.72]Because that's what we do.
[12:43.46]I knew this was coming.
[12:47.44]Oh, whatever.
[12:49.28]It's all good.
[12:53.40]Here's how we're gonna do this.
[12:56.03]We're gonna do the ultimate joke.
[12:58.37]The ultimate, like, funny joke.
[13:02.71]Like, I can guarantee you that this funny joke will be done by anybody that streams this game.
[13:15.77]If you see a streamer that's playing this, you're guaranteed to see this as a funny joke.
[13:20.25]I promise you.
[13:20.87]Let's go with 20,000.
[13:31.40]Mmm, 15,000.
[13:32.14]Okay, that's team 1, team 2.
[13:38.94]I don't even care about this point.
[13:40.08]These guys can be on any random damn team.
[13:45.22]One Chuck Norris.
[13:46.34]You have to have a Chuck Norris.
[13:50.24]That's fine.
[13:58.04]I drop nukes when I have nothing left to do.
[13:59.72]That is accurate war.
[14:01.79]Oh, God.
[14:04.89]Guaranteed funny.
[14:05.69]This is a guaranteed funny joke.
[14:09.05]Because there are 15,000 chickens up here.
[14:14.11]So, you know, you guys better laugh.
[14:19.17]Because, I mean, I'm one of those funny comedy streamers.
[14:21.25]You know, I have to.
[14:22.21]I'm going to do that.
[14:25.50]Here we go.
[14:25.84]Let's... Actually, I want these to be... Ten soldiers.
[14:34.54]And let's just go for it.
[14:36.56]I have no idea who's going to win.
[14:43.21]War of the Bias.
[14:45.23]Do they have Steam Workshop for this?
[14:46.55]That would be fucking hilarious if you could put anything you want.
[14:50.04]Are you guys ready to laugh?
[14:51.52]Here it comes.
[14:51.98]I hope you guys are ready to start cracking up about this.
[14:58.00]Because look, here are the chickens.
[15:02.34]There's 15,000 of them.
[15:07.06]And... We've got the soldiers over here.
[15:11.33]You guys are already laughing?
[15:12.33]Come on, it hasn't even started yet.
[15:14.01]Let's go.
[15:16.63]Oh, shit.
[15:17.27]These guys are on attack.
[15:18.22]They don't know how to defend.
[15:20.84]Oh, God.
[15:22.68]They're just, like, on the way over to the soldiers.
[15:24.54]There's just ten soldiers that are gonna kill every single... Let's just stay here.
[15:28.78]We're gonna stay with the soldiers this time.
[15:41.03]Did they actually say for America?
[15:44.73]For America!
[15:45.55]Oh, uh oh.
[15:53.70]Have you guys laughed yet?
[15:55.04]Did you guys laugh at the funny joke yet?
[15:56.60]Did one of these guys die?
[16:08.54]Oh no, these are the guys that are dying.
[16:13.64]Wow, the US soldiers are gonna get in their asses kicked by these random... Oh god, I gotta run.
[16:18.64]Is there a sprint?
[16:19.12]Yeah, there is.
[16:19.52]Alright, the goal is to stay alive as this one guy.
[16:25.29]Wake up.
[16:27.31]There's one chicken following me.
[16:31.45]That chicken's dead.
[16:32.07]That's fine.
[16:32.75]I'm going up to the king.
[16:33.73]There is no king.
[16:39.56]There we are.
[16:48.60]I'm gonna be the last one standing.
[16:49.82]Oh, there's one assassin that's chasing me.
[16:57.27]Come on.
[16:59.49]Are you fucking kidding me?
[17:05.03]Well, now I have... Now I have to be this guy.
[17:10.69]We're just gonna jump... We're gonna reincarnate into random people.
[17:13.43]Is this guy on my team?
[17:26.66]Nice swing.
[17:27.54]Good job.
[17:28.02]Alright, fuck this.
[17:31.54]I'm going up here.
[17:33.40]There are way too many orcs.
[17:34.58]Orcs are so strong and I always make so many of them.
[17:41.24]How did this guy have 500 health?
[17:43.66]I shot him three different times.
[17:55.34]Okay, this is kind of funny.
[17:57.66]This is a little funny, I will say, sure.
[17:59.86]Hey, you guys want to see how they make the McDonald's chicken nuggets?
[18:06.59]It's like this.
[18:09.31]They just stuff all these chickens down like a conveyor belt.
[18:11.91]Oh god, they're coming after me.
[18:14.77]No!
[18:15.96]No!
[18:16.90]I can't move!
[18:18.34]I can't move!
[18:21.09]Oh no, it's the revenge of the McDonald's chicken nuggets.
[18:23.91]He jokes.
[18:30.87]Oh, we gotta take... We gotta possess this one now.
[18:37.55]Ah!
[18:49.61]No, no, no!
[18:50.11]Turn around!
[18:50.53]Go this way!
[18:58.80]No!
[18:59.18]No!
[18:59.90]Don't put me between a button!
[19:01.26]Don't put me between two buttons!
[19:03.94]What the fuck happened over here?
[19:12.53]Well, nothing.
[19:13.53]Nothing important.
[19:20.22]What?!
[19:25.67]This seriously is just a fucking chicken patty factory.
[19:30.13]Why are they all doing this?
[19:34.21]Where are they all going?
[19:39.20]This is terrible.
[19:42.90]Alright, there's so many- this is just like bugs.
[19:47.11]You know on the Discovery Channel when you see when they open up like the beehive and there's like the millions of larva?
[19:52.43]That's what this is.
[19:55.78]Or... This is the... This is a very, very close, close-up image like a microscope of a tire.
[20:02.28]That's like the little pieces of rubber.
[20:07.24]They're not even doing anything.
[20:11.23]Uh, we ran out of chickens.
[20:13.93]It is on both sides.
[20:15.17]Well, here's the thing.
[20:16.19]Oh, wow.
[20:16.63]This is very interesting.
[20:17.77]Very interesting, guys.
[20:19.45]Check this out, right?
[20:22.16]Right here, we have two separate conveyor belts of chicken.
[20:26.38]This is a team over here of knights, and this is a team of orcs.
[20:32.62]Once the chickens are all carved through, there's going to be a fight in the middle.
[20:37.45]And I'm interested to see what happens.
[20:42.66]So once everybody's done making suits... We're getting close to the end here.
[20:50.45]And then there's gonna be a fight that meets in the middle.
[20:57.19]This is tactical advantage of who kills all the chickens first.
[21:01.95]Wait, they're the same team?
[21:03.05]No, they're not, are they?
[21:04.95]Are they the same team?
[21:08.13]They better not be the same team.
[21:09.83]Wait, they're working together.
[21:11.09]That guy just died.
[21:14.95]This is such a traffic jam.
[21:18.01]They're working together to kill the chicken.
[21:23.99]Okay, wait, they actually might be on the same team.
[21:26.85]Hold on, hold on, hold on, dude, what?
[21:30.95]How claustrophobic is this?
[21:33.76]Oh god, yeah, they're on the same fucking team.
[21:39.60]This is about to be over.

[22:51.18]What the fuck is going on here?
[22:54.30]I thought these guys were on the same team.
[22:57.20]They're no longer on the same team.
[22:59.94]Since when?
[23:00.96]There's gotta be one chicken left, right?
[23:04.45]Where are they running to?
[23:09.25]They're all circling over here.
[23:10.43]Why?
[23:10.59]Why?
[23:15.62]What are they all running towards?
[23:16.68]Oh no, now we have an orc meat factory.
[23:19.35]Now we have an orc nugget factory.
[23:20.89]Where are they all going?
[23:26.57]Who is fighting in here?
[23:29.83]Oh god fucking damn it.
[23:33.17]It's the stupid fucking Chuck Norris.
[23:38.97]This 46 chickens alive.
[23:42.48]Where are they?
[23:46.89]Does anybody see these 46 chickens?
[23:57.60]Where?
[23:59.20]They're like stuck in a wall somewhere?
[24:01.08]They have to be stuck in a wall.
[24:05.35]How did this guy die?
[24:12.27]I just saw right click to possess.
[24:16.35]Where are these chickens?
[24:17.57]There's 46 random fucking chickens that are nowhere to be found.
[24:26.89]Shit, there's still 46.
[24:27.69]They're in a weird spot.
[24:29.41]Buried somewhere.
[24:32.52]Okay, well, we got these guys here.
[24:39.66]I don't know.
[24:42.40]I don't know.
[24:44.48]But Chuck Norris is still memeing his way to the top.
[24:50.31]Or is he dead?
[24:52.67]How are the two Chuck Norrises alive?
[24:54.71]There's only one that exists.
[24:59.95]Wait, where were they?
[25:05.96]On the cliff?
[25:08.14]Where?
[25:08.40]I don't...
[25:13.27]Where do you see chickens here?
[25:19.90]I don't see chickens.
[25:25.40]I'm blind?
[25:28.67]The crevice in the... Okay, good.
[25:32.49]Here we go.
[25:37.60]I can't really... I'm stuck.
[25:39.38]I have to, like, move him in a different direction.
[25:45.08]Okay.
[25:46.94]Alright, that's fine.
[25:48.56]Can't chickens fly?
[25:49.48]What the fuck is that?
[25:53.34]It won't let me go up this way.
[25:56.55]No, there's no way I can bring these guys down.
[25:58.41]I can't go up that way.
[26:00.55]I just get stuck.
[26:03.85]Maybe I can glitch my way up here.
[26:05.13]I don't think I can.
[26:06.75]I think these are lost causes.
[26:07.91]We have to find the other batch of chickens.
[26:11.53]Unless there's like a... Okay, good.
[26:13.19]I just did like a Tony Hawk grind.
[26:15.28]I'm good.
[26:18.24]Oh, shit.
[26:19.32]This one fucking idiot.
[26:21.46]One random straggler is now gonna catch up to me.
[26:29.81]Where did you even come from?
[26:31.79]You have no purpose.
[26:33.95]This guy was just stuck in a wall back here and he decided he was gonna kill me.
[26:38.37]Like, you know what?
[26:38.79]Fuck this guy.
[26:43.84]We are dropping this guy off the cliff so he doesn't do that again.
[26:51.80]Go this way.
[26:55.38]And just fall.
[26:58.90]A spear went like... Okay, where are the other 40... Wait, a chicken died.
[27:13.41]How did another chicken die?
[27:14.85]Did I?
[27:15.17]Oh, I killed it.
[27:16.63]Okay, here are more.
[27:17.37]Where are they going?
[27:20.03]These guys found their way somewhere.
[27:21.54]Okay.
[27:22.14]Are they gonna... I guess they're gonna go over here.
[27:28.48]That's a very bad idea.
[27:30.00]But, okay.
[27:31.92]How's Chuck Norris doing?
[27:34.80]Oh, he's LOLing everybody.
[27:37.19]How's his health?
[27:38.53]He's un... No.
[27:40.71]I'm sorry.
[27:42.43]Like, this ain't fucking happening.
[27:43.61]I'm sorry, guys.
[27:45.73]It's like Chuck Norris is getting dropped off a cliff.
[27:48.69]He's going to make this just stupid.
[27:51.75]So, I hope you guys laughed at the funny Chuck Norris meme, but he can't exist anymore.
[28:01.70]And I'm just being chased now.
[28:02.68]That's fine.
[28:04.12]I just have to drop him off a high mountain and he'll fucking die.
[28:10.96]Is this high enough?
[28:12.24]Let's hope so.
[28:16.10]Not high enough.
[28:19.59]Look, if we just, like, run him away, it's gonna take him a long time to figure out how to fucking get back here.
[28:26.69]He's not gonna be able to figure this out.
[28:31.81]Right, isn't, like, the only thing is AI is just stupid.
[28:34.02]It's not gonna be able to figure this out at all.
[28:42.30]Alright, well Chuck Norris is gonna take time.
[28:44.82]What is happening with the armies?
[28:49.61]Where are they currently trying to go to?
[28:50.99]They're trying to go up.
[28:54.45]They're going up?
[28:57.17]And they're going around?
[29:08.22]They so badly want these chickens.
[29:12.78]Okay, now I understand.
[29:13.86]Now I understand.
[29:17.60]Oh my god.
[29:21.72]No, no, no, no!
[29:22.88]No!
[29:26.75]They're still alive.
[29:35.69]Get out of the fucking way.
[29:45.69]I wish they would just all start to drop, man.
[29:49.09]Like, honest to God, how funny would that be?
[29:52.93]Come on, you AI can't be... No!
[29:58.30]How is he still alive?
[29:59.44]What the fuck?
[30:01.18]You can't still be living from that.
[30:08.58]Oh, come on.
[30:11.14]I'm letting this chicken kill him.
[30:16.48]Dude, this would be so funny if they all just were pouring off the cliff.
[30:22.20]How the fuck did you all get down here?
[30:23.77]Wait, there was one chicken down here.
[30:25.89]So they all freaked out.
[30:30.23]Oh, God.
[30:30.89]Where's Chuck Norris?
[30:34.06]Has anybody found him yet?
[30:36.20]Can we see where he is?
[30:37.12]I'm dropping a nuke on Chuck Norris.
[30:40.00]He's not going to fuck this up.
[30:42.78]Where is he?
[30:44.61]He's over here fighting.
[30:46.01]Okay, we're dropping a nuke on Chuck Norris.
[30:48.31]Get out of here.
[30:49.89]I'm putting him far away.
[30:52.47]That's not what I want.
[30:53.07]I want this stupid fucking mean queen.
[30:55.93]This mean king.
[30:59.29]Come on, mean king Chuck Norris.
[31:03.19]Yeah, this way.
[31:05.29]Go all the way out into the wilderness.
[31:10.84]Here we go.
[31:11.98]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[31:14.44]All the way out here.
[31:18.48]I think I'm far away enough.
[31:19.84]I hope so.
[31:24.30]And here we go.
[31:34.65]Where is he?
[31:37.19]He's still alive.
[31:38.71]And did everybody die from that?
[31:41.83]Motherfucker, don't even tell me.
[31:43.63]There's only seven chickens.
[31:46.21]It killed everybody and the seven chickens survived and one Chuck Norris.
[31:51.90]Come on.
[31:53.36]No.
[31:56.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:57.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:58.16]Stop, stop, stop, stop it.
[31:59.14]Stop it.
[32:00.12]What the fuck?
[32:00.76]He has 76,000 health still.
[32:01.52]Chuck Norris wins.
[32:20.73]They can't even hurt him.
[32:23.69]He's not allowed to ever be a part of this ever again.
[32:28.10]Legit Chuck Norris is never allowed again.
[32:30.00]That was stupid.
[32:44.29]Oh well.
[32:45.96]Comedy bronze.
[32:49.80]Alright.
[32:50.62]I want like a battle on the mountains.
[32:53.50]But you can't really do it.
[32:56.01]Everybody just falls through.
[32:56.99]It's really like back here is the only... No, I don't like this map.
[33:04.79]There's not a whole lot of terrain to cover.
[33:10.65]I really only like this map.
[33:12.33]This is like the only map that I think I like.
[33:15.02]So far in the early access.
[33:19.33]Hey, Granny Bacon, thank you for the $6.
[33:20.93]Shitty games, shitty streams, shitty jokes.
[33:22.61]Take my money.
[33:25.15]Thank you for the $6.
[33:25.69]I appreciate it.
[33:29.05]No fucking Chuck Norris.
[33:33.53]Okay.
[33:35.39]We're going to go with beer.
[33:38.59]Let's try something.
[33:39.33]We're going to try something different.
[33:40.47]We're going to do another funny joke streamer.
[33:44.72]And we'll see how far we get with this.
[33:50.75]Okay.
[33:51.25]We're going to do penguins.
[33:53.59]Penguins, chickens, and tortoises.
[33:55.21]This is the animal war.
[33:56.93]Funny streamer, right?
[33:59.63]Like, hysterical streamer, right?
[34:09.44]If I was a funny streamer, I would do this.
[34:12.88]Don't you guys think?
[34:27.12]All penguins.
[34:29.73]And we have to have one Chuck Norris.
[34:32.89]To good measure.
[34:37.81]No.
[34:38.61]Uh... Catapult.
[34:41.33]And like two... Like a fucking hundred catapults.
[34:43.89]No, fifty catapults.
[34:45.83]Yeah.
[34:50.59]They're gonna be right here.
[34:54.07]So here we go.
[34:54.84]We're gonna just...
[34:57.54]Just meet in the middle somewhere.
[34:58.90]If you can even spawn in.
[34:59.86]Hopefully they can spawn in.
[35:03.43]Who knows if they're even going to be able to do this or not.
[35:05.87]I'm just going to put them here and just hope it works.
[35:09.01]So who's on top?
[35:09.65]Penguins are on the top.
[35:10.53]It's every man for himself.
[35:13.63]No Chuck Norris allowed.
[35:15.05]But we do have to have one other person.
[35:16.89]We're going to have our Golden Knight.
[35:22.93]Yes.
[35:23.55]The Golden Knight has to exist.
[35:26.23]It just has to.
[35:27.69]And let's go.
[35:31.95]There's two groups of penguins.
[35:33.21]What?
[35:33.41]Did I fuck it up?
[35:34.93]I fucked it up.
[35:45.06]No chickens.
[35:48.02]Easy fix.
[35:48.59]Don't worry.
[35:55.76]Uh, chicken.
[35:56.67]Team, what is chicken?
[35:57.39]Chicken, penguin, tortoise, catapult, golden knight.
[35:59.97]Let's go.
[36:00.23]What, are they going to add rats to this game?
[36:03.65]Good question.
[36:12.40]Loading units.
[36:14.86]Here comes the joke.
[36:16.66]Hope you guys are ready to laugh.
[36:22.26]Okay.
[36:23.80]Alright, they loaded in here.
[36:26.58]They load it in there, and then where are the catapults?
[36:28.53]Over there, right?
[36:29.49]Yeah.
[36:29.67]I don't know whose perspective we should be watching from this.
[36:34.71]But... I mean, my computer's like slow to a crawl.
[36:38.59]Let's just go.
[36:40.25]Nothing matters anymore.
[36:45.17]Jesus.
[36:52.16]Why are they dying from this?
[36:57.30]How come some of them aren't dying and some of them are just being killed?
[37:01.38]Why?
[37:05.50]That shouldn't be happening.
[37:09.56]The penguins are at an automatic disadvantage.
[37:15.22]So many of them are dead.
[37:18.14]Where are they falling from?
[37:25.55]Well, the penguins are at it.
[37:26.75]No!
[37:27.21]The numbers are already...
[37:43.40]Why aren't they just walking the correct way?
[37:47.70]Why aren't you walking the right way?
[37:49.98]Why?
[37:52.34]They're going for the catapults.
[37:53.44]Penguins already lost.
[37:55.22]Penguins lose.
[37:55.74]What about the chickens?
[37:56.38]Where are the chickens dying from?
[37:59.21]We've lost like 55,000 chickens?
[38:03.11]How?
[38:05.51]The chickens haven't even done anything.
[38:06.65]How have we lost 1,000 chickens?
[38:11.65]Where?
[38:16.19]I have no idea.
[38:19.56]Okay, so tortoises win.
[38:22.28]I'm pretty sure we can be certain of that.
[38:26.38]Tortoises haven't even got hair.
[38:27.42]Fucking Jesus.
[38:32.63]This is so laggy.
[38:33.67]We're going to have to go from the tortoise perspective.
[38:39.71]Only one tortoise has died.
[38:44.05]No, sorry, two.
[38:45.19]Two tortoises have died.
[38:50.67]No, this is a no.
[38:51.47]This is an absolute no fucking contest.
[38:57.73]Let's go over here.
[39:01.66]Okay, so there's only... Weirdly, there's still like six or seven thousand penguins.
[39:09.48]Okay, what about over... They're so far away from each other, too.
[39:11.84]This is just so stupid.
[39:12.84]Okay.
[39:14.67]And they're still dying.
[39:15.59]They're still falling off the cliff and dying.
[39:17.21]The chickens have such a far way to go.
[39:23.37]Is Tommy the turtle still enabled?
[39:25.05]He's not here.
[39:31.43]Should I even the playing field a little?
[39:33.61]Alright, I'm going to even the playing field.
[39:34.65]I'm going to drop a nuke all the way over here and see if it kills like 5,000 of them.
[39:38.01]Oh, where are the golden knights?
[39:41.92]They're already dead.
[39:45.46]Gold Knights are already dead.
[39:46.30]So we're going to drop a nuke all the way down here.
[39:49.80]Way far away from everything.
[39:51.62]We just want to hit this little quadrant of turtles.
[39:54.22]So like right here.
[39:59.04]Okay.
[40:04.23]That didn't hit anyone.
[40:06.55]I guess we're going to be a little closer.
[40:08.17]So like here.
[40:13.55]Yeah, that thinned him out a little bit.
[40:14.83]That thinned him out a little.
[40:15.65]One more.
[40:16.43]Like here.
[40:20.80]There we are.
[40:21.20]13,000.
[40:21.72]This is... This is fucking stupid.
[40:40.30]What is going on up here?
[40:44.21]Are they just getting traffic jammed in here?
[40:45.99]Of course they are.
[40:47.35]Why though?
[40:55.60]They're just stuck.
[40:56.88]That's all.
[41:00.02]Where are they trying to go?
[41:02.50]Straight out the door?
[41:06.20]What has them blocked?
[41:09.14]Nothing.
[41:13.30]There's no block.
[41:17.31]They're trying to go for the catapults and they're all too dumb.
[41:20.21]And then they have another frontier with the chickens.
[41:24.23]It's going to be a chicken versus tortoise battle.
[41:28.81]Today's weather mostly sunny with some sun.
[41:37.26]This is a little too spread out for my liking.
[41:44.04]And they're just going single file too.
[41:54.07]I had to do that.
[41:54.63]I had to get rid of the catapults.
[41:56.47]The catapults were just not happening.
[42:02.09]Kill all.
[42:04.51]Some of the still penguins are alive.
[42:10.96]Two spread out.
[42:11.54]Better nuke them.
[42:15.94]Yep.
[42:19.66]Who cares?
[42:22.36]Just fuck it.
[42:23.74]That one didn't work.
[42:24.84]That one wasn't funny.
[42:26.98]That one wasn't very good.
[42:27.74]Alright, let's close it out.
[42:31.29]I'm going to do one more.
[42:31.99]This time we're going to do something very special.
[42:34.11]We're going to do something very special here, guys.
[42:38.39]Hmm.
[42:42.46]Hmm.
[42:46.84]Let's go with 150 damage.
[42:49.80]Times like 5 multiplier and like it times 10 movements.
[42:52.66]Times 100 movement speed if I can.
[42:55.46]Alright, take a screenshot.
[42:57.24]This is gonna be me.
[43:00.24]Me.
[43:01.95]Me versus all of you.
[43:05.17]Hope you guys are ready.
[43:07.45]I get to be on a fucking horse though.
[43:10.05]So how many people are watching the stream?
[43:11.13]2,700?
[43:11.15]2,708 people?
[43:15.39]Me versus the whole fucking stream.
[43:19.89]Good luck.
[43:24.71]30,000 health.
[43:28.60]No.
[43:29.10]300,000 health.
[43:33.24]Cavalry.
[43:34.12]Germa.
[43:35.32]There it is.
[43:38.88]And then now we're going to do...
[43:43.53]So you guys are going to be just like... I don't know.
[43:48.73]You guys are just going to be like wild men, because you're all like wild and uncontrollable.
[43:55.63]And each one of you, there's 27, 22, we lost.
[43:57.10]A few of you guys already died.
[43:58.46]There was 27, 08, and like 10 of you died.
[43:59.40]There's 26, 94 now.
[44:07.86]You guys are only going to have... You guys are only going to have fucking 10 health.
[44:17.33]No.
[44:18.25]You can have 7.
[44:19.57]No.
[44:20.91]You can have 10 health.
[44:24.27]10 health.
[44:27.92]Go with like... Go with 100 damage.
[44:31.00]No.
[44:31.88]10 damage.
[44:34.22]Times 5 is okay.
[44:34.86]Okay.
[44:40.43]Chat.
[44:40.79]There you go.
[44:44.31]10 health, 10 damage.

[58:04.33]I need more attack speed than that.
[58:09.33]And chat needs to be toned down a little.
[58:15.49]Chat's attack speed.
[58:16.49]No, you don't get that.
[58:17.95]You guys get times 500.

[58:39.73]Okay, Burger Boy, first line of defense.
[58:41.94]Here I am.
[58:42.52]I want to control my guy first of all.
[58:44.20]Very, very first of all.
[58:45.20]Let's go.
[58:45.60]Okay, go ahead, Burger Boy.
[58:47.34]Let's take a look at what you can do.
[58:49.28]I'm going to cover his flank.
[58:50.24]Burger Boy is now not going to be totally worthless.
[58:53.27]He'll be at least worth something.
[58:56.47]He's dead again.
[59:06.35]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, come here.
[59:10.49]Ah.
[59:14.15]If I lose, I have to play Spore.
[59:16.03]You got it.
[59:17.19]If I lose this match, I have to play Spore on stream again.
[59:21.07]Ain't gonna fucking happen.
[59:24.79]You think I'm gonna let that happen?
[59:28.69]I ain't playing Spore on stream again, guys.
[59:33.21]I will tunnel you all in here.
[59:43.87]Oh, that guy, that guy, that guy had a lot to say.
[59:45.63]Come on, follow me.
[59:50.95]Come on.
[59:53.19]What's that?
[59:54.19]Ooh.
[59:55.14]Here comes the environment.
[59:57.26]Environment kills.
[60:03.08]No, I ain't going that way.
[60:03.90]Fuck that.
[60:05.50]How are you guys all still dying?
[60:11.37]Cheater?
[60:11.69]What do you mean cheater?
[60:12.41]This is just the way it is.
[60:13.83]I'm doing environment kills.
[60:14.91]The game just almost crashed right there.
[60:20.97]Where are they?
[60:21.49]Oh, I'm actually kind of getting scared.
[60:23.65]Don't fall a height more than like five feet because it will kill me.
[60:27.29]All right, come on.
[60:30.32]Get some... I don't even know where these are going.
[60:39.68]Okay, good.
[60:40.30]Keep going.
[60:42.86]I just got to wrap around.
[60:43.88]I can wrap around the whole map.
[60:46.62]I don't want to fucking play Spore.
[60:49.85]I will be a coward.
[60:51.71]As long as I don't have to play Spore.
[60:53.33]I just have to get rid of 1,900 more viewers.
[60:55.59]I'm kind of getting trapped back here.
[61:02.63]Am I just trapped here?
[61:07.59]I guess I'm trapped.
[61:50.00]How do I make this a tie?
[61:59.52]That was a glitch.
[62:00.16]It didn't count.
[62:01.22]Did you hear that?
[62:01.76]Like, did you hear that?
[62:03.82]That was a glitch.
[62:04.56]It didn't count.
[62:05.50]That was a glitch.
[62:07.60]The game glitched on me.
[62:08.54]It doesn't count.
[62:09.50]This fucking map sucks.
[62:10.94]No, it doesn't count.
[62:11.86]We're doing it again here.
[62:15.80]And we're deleting.
[62:16.54]Burger Boy's been fucking useless.
[62:18.08]So he's getting, he's being deleted.
[62:20.10]Come and get me.
[62:22.02]And you know what?
[62:24.80]I'll give you fucking 3,000.
[62:25.60]We'll cap it off at 3,000 chat viewers.
[62:27.74]There's 2,900 people in now.
[62:43.76]Let's go.
[62:46.22]Bring it on.
[62:48.74]Double down.
[62:49.84]Double down.
[62:50.30]Alright, double down.
[62:50.96]If chat wins, I will stream Spore for a month.
[62:57.33]No.
[62:57.75]God.
[62:58.83]No, that's not real.
[63:00.13]That's a joke.
[63:03.43]Double down.
[63:04.73]If chat wins, then I have to stream Spore for a fucking month.
[63:10.49]Who fucking wants to do that shit?
[63:12.89]Nobody.
[63:14.47]Absolutely fucking no one.
[63:16.87]That's not the case.
[63:17.91]That's a joke.
[63:20.08]That's a joke.
[63:21.06]Come on, I'm in range.
[63:21.86]I ain't streaming Spore for a month!
[63:42.74]I love how I'm just pissing these out.
[63:49.35]Yeah, fuck you, chat.
[63:51.13]You ain't gonna get what you want this time.
[63:59.16]Oh, thank God.
[63:59.82]Thank God chat is so stupid.
[64:02.60]Thank God.
[64:03.96]Thank... I don't even have to do a damn thing.

[64:11.02]I win.
[64:15.26]Oh, wait, wait.
[64:15.68]Some of the chatters... Some of the chatters have gotten a little bit more intelligent.
[64:19.63]Where are they going?
[64:21.01]Where are you guys going?
[64:29.94]Huh?
[64:31.46]What a fucking roundabout way to get over here.
[64:33.70]Die.
[64:48.35]I'm not gonna lose this one.
[64:50.75]I gotta lose this one.
[64:51.65]I just gotta get rid of 2,700 more people.
[64:59.15]It's a hive mind.
[65:05.22]New spot.
[65:06.38]Whoa!
[65:06.76]Easy.
[65:07.66]Don't run that fast.
[65:09.60]New spot.
[65:10.52]See?
[65:11.02]You guys have no idea how to get over here.
[65:15.73]See, Twitch chat is like, you're playing Twitch plays Pokemon right now.
[65:19.40]Oh my god, it skipped the shit out of me.
[65:30.98]It skipped the apps.
[65:32.26]I can't go that way.
[65:33.96]Oh no.
[65:35.16]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[65:40.06]I'm losing more health than I want to right now.
[65:47.48]I have to go through.
[65:48.14]I have to go through them.
[65:51.14]Shit.
[65:51.90]I've lost like 5% health.
[65:52.98]Oh my god.
[65:53.82]There's so many people.
[65:54.94]There's so many Twitch chowders over there.
[65:59.52]Oh my god.

[66:00.02]They're so dumb.
[66:00.46]Come on.
[66:02.60]Come on.
[66:02.94]Keep falling.
[66:03.84]Keep falling with the same trick, Twitch.
[66:14.12]I'm going up to the castle.
[66:15.44]I'm getting high ground.
[66:19.95]No, up here.
[66:21.71]High ground.
[66:23.01]Get to high ground just to have them funnel in and kill them.
[66:26.96]Yeah, even further.
[66:29.42]No, no, no.
[66:29.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[66:30.66]I don't want to get you.
[66:31.60]I'm going to trap myself in here.
[66:32.68]I'm going to trap myself.
[66:33.60]It's okay.
[66:42.81]It's just 2,300 people.
[66:48.13]Why am I shooting that high?
[66:55.15]I'm gonna win.
[66:56.31]I just don't even have to move and I'll be fine.
[67:02.31]Although I am kind of getting a little overwhelmed.
[67:05.57]You guys are making your way in.
[67:10.24]Yeah, it's time to move.
[67:10.88]I gotta move.
[67:11.16]I gotta move.
[67:13.04]This way.
[67:15.32]Watch the cliff.
[67:16.74]Watch the cliff.
[67:20.09]These guys are tabbed out.
[67:23.53]I gotta get the people that aren't watching the stream that are still here that are tabbed out doing something else.
[67:27.94]Easy.
[67:31.98]I don't know what YouTube video you guys are watching or what fucking random recipe online you were looking up, but you tabbed out.
[67:38.10]Oh, shit.
[67:38.52]I'm getting surrounded.
[67:43.03]Fuck.
[67:46.37]I can't move.
[67:48.11]I legitimately am stuck right now.
[67:49.33]This is not good.
[67:50.47]I gotta make this work.
[67:51.09]Come on.
[67:55.33]I'm still fine.
[67:56.16]I still have like a billion health.
[67:57.94]I'm gonna be fine.
[68:05.00]This is so stupid.
[68:08.74]What am I shooting at?
[68:12.05]What?
[68:12.25]Look at this one guy.
[68:15.40]Look at these two guys.
[68:16.96]These three guys don't even know what's happening.
[68:18.12]These guys just came to the stream and they don't even know.
[68:21.71]What's happening?
[68:22.25]What are we doing, chat?
[68:23.15]These guys don't even know.
[68:25.23]Thank God.
[68:37.84]Slowly but surely.
[68:40.08]Oh, shit.
[68:41.46]I got wrapped around.
[68:42.16]Don't fall off the cliff.
[68:44.38]You see, like, my only issue is I have to be careful of myself, right?
[68:49.46]Just like every other stream that I do.
[68:52.15]Like, Jermo always, like... Jermo always fucks something up.
[69:00.79]And, like, technically, something goes wrong and he fucks his own stream up.
[69:04.60]That's exactly what just happened right now.
[69:08.38]Whoa.
[69:08.52]Whoa.
[69:13.79]I'm stuck.
[69:14.83]I'm stuck!
[69:18.75]No!
[69:24.72]It's okay, there's only 1600 of you.
[69:36.36]I made it.
[69:41.03]We're getting to him.
[69:47.03]I like being up here.
[69:47.73]It's okay.
[69:48.25]Even if I get attacked.
[69:48.93]A lot more people get it.
[69:53.95]If I can make it across, I don't want to try it.
[69:56.10]Alright, I'm at the halfway point of you guys.
[70:05.26]You guys are done.
[70:06.62]You guys don't even have me at halfway yet.
[70:08.02]I don't have to play Spore for a month.
[70:09.64]Thank God.
[70:18.90]Wait, what are you guys saying?
[70:19.62]Like, wait, I can... A nuke will kill me if I do a nuke.
[70:23.53]Wait, maybe it won't.
[70:25.15]Holy shit.
[70:25.67]Wait, actually, it might not.
[70:27.69]How much damage does a nuke do?
[70:31.35]Because I have, like, 2.4 million health.
[70:33.03]Does a nuke do more than, like, 2 million damage?
[70:40.24]I win.
[70:47.04]I win!
[70:48.14]I'm the winner!
[70:50.66]I already won, that doesn't count.
[70:52.58]I win.
[70:57.98]What?
[70:58.62]What are you talking about?
[71:01.18]I could have had a chance to lose there.
[71:05.25]That could have killed me, too.
[71:10.45]Four for a month, I cheated.
[71:11.83]No!
[71:12.39]Wait, who said I couldn't cheat?
[71:17.65]Alright, one more time.
[71:19.63]I'll do it one more time.
[71:20.73]This is it.
[71:21.79]This is the end.
[71:22.47]This is the final straw here.
[71:35.10]That's fine.
[71:36.32]This is me.
[71:37.80]I'm in my house right now.
[71:40.98]Good luck.
[71:44.78]Team 2, chat, we're gonna change you guys too.
[71:47.42]This is the final straw.
[71:48.68]I'm in my house, you guys are surrounding my house.
[71:55.02]And you know what?
[71:56.66]I'll give you one up here.
[71:59.47]You guys can be like spearmen.
[72:03.95]Yeah, this is spore for a year.
[72:05.57]I'm gonna give you guys 50 damage.
[72:17.64]You guys don't get to move fast.
[72:21.38]That's fine.
[72:22.38]Good luck.
[72:25.50]How many people here?
[72:27.53]3034?
[72:29.45]Good luck.
[72:33.85]Good luck.
[72:36.55]You had 100 health before?
[72:37.55]Yeah, well, life ain't fair.
[72:41.16]You know why you guys have 1 health now?
[72:42.40]Because I'm in my house.
[72:45.26]I'm inside of my house.
[72:46.58]So you guys really expected to be doing damage to me when I'm in a house?
[72:50.92]Didn't think so.
[72:57.50]Shit.
[73:01.50]I'm in my house.
[73:04.11]You guys are moving really slow.
[73:09.29]Perfect.
[73:13.07]When are you guys going to be in range?
[73:14.11]Get in range.
[73:14.61]Hurry up.
[73:16.24]Come on.
[73:22.59]I'm just waiting for you guys.
[73:24.81]You're all holding up signs.
[73:38.90]Why can I not attack?
[73:42.30]Attack?
[73:42.72]Why?
[73:43.28]Shoot it.
[73:44.60]Oh!
[73:52.67]I'm just shooting out, like, bile.
[74:02.41]Throwing up on you guys.
[74:12.72]Cheating.
[74:13.90]This is less effective than me as an archer, by the way.
[74:19.20]This really is.
[74:19.78]This is less effective than being an archer.
[74:22.74]How is that possible?
[74:40.90]Where are you guys all going?
[74:46.64]We're already one third dead.
[74:54.79]Well, like, only like 10% of you know.
[74:56.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[74:57.15]You've all figured it out.
[74:57.95]You all figured it out.
[74:59.55]Oh, dear.
[74:59.95]You all figured it out.
[75:00.77]It's okay.
[75:01.01]Get the fuck out of here.
[75:16.18]Mmm.
[75:17.22]About to get surrounded here.
[75:19.08]Don't even matter.
[75:19.54]I'm fine.
[75:19.96]Can I run people over?
[75:25.94]Oh shit, I can't run people over.
[75:33.43]This is fucking dumb.
[75:34.89]This is dumb.
[75:38.97]You guys have no chance.
[75:46.30]I'm just invincible.
[75:47.38]Don't stand a chance.
[75:48.26]Good luck.
[75:48.58]Come get me.
[75:56.76]Not fair, no stakes.
[76:00.06]There were stakes.
[76:00.62]It was spore for a year.
[76:01.80]Alright, this is it.
[76:10.48]The bet's off.
[76:11.72]Game over.
[76:14.78]Local streamer mocks entire chat from mobile home.
[76:21.00]You're in a house you can't move.
[76:24.56]This is going to kill me.
[76:26.92]That didn't count.
[76:27.60]I was doing that on purpose.
[76:29.10]Because that was it.
[76:32.54]I have to play Spore once.
[76:34.04]I'll play Spore once.
[76:36.00]At some point in the future.
[76:39.89]You've become Chuck Norris, don't you see?
[76:41.75]Holy shit.
[76:43.63]You're right.
[76:45.77]I really did become like Chuck.
[76:47.03]Alright.
[76:49.87]The final one.
[76:50.67]It's gonna be so funny.
[76:51.60]What am I gonna do?
[76:55.62]Like this.
[76:58.23]Ha ha.
[77:01.29]The ultimate battle.
[77:04.03]Chuck Norris versus Chuck Norris.
[77:14.43]T2.
[77:14.69]Ha ha.
[77:19.15]What is this team?
[77:24.21]I can't.
[77:24.63]What is this?
[77:32.71]I don't know.
[77:36.61]This is the moment.
[77:37.05]This is... Get the DLC.
[77:40.45]This is going to be so funny.
[77:47.06]Chuck Norris versus Chuck Norris.
[77:52.32]The game crashed.
[77:53.60]The game didn't even want me to make this joke.
[77:55.09]It's so awful.
[77:57.13]Yeah, the game broke.
[78:02.56]There you go.
[78:03.86]Uh, game over.
[78:10.07]That's it.
[78:17.44]Yep.
[78:19.12]Well, and that's gonna be it.
[78:25.42]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around, for watching.
[78:29.10]Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:30.31]Before we go, before we go, before we go.
[78:33.27]So, next week, now that I have you guys all here, there's 3,000 people, I might as well bring it up.
[78:39.49]Next week, we're going to start a new thing.
[78:44.39]All of my streams next week are going to be themed.
[78:47.73]So, there's going to be either a Western week, where I play a shitload of Western games that you guys have never seen before.
[78:55.85]Dinosaur week, where a bunch of the old carnivore games, the old Jurassic Park games throughout the whole week.
[79:04.96]And I got like 40 or 50 games that are really old that you can't get on Steam.
[79:11.18]They're really like obscure titles.
[79:14.48]So it's either Game Show Week, Dinosaur Week, or Western Week.
[79:20.87]Please vote.
[79:22.61]Because that poll is going to be around for a while.
[79:24.47]We're doing all of these, by the way.
[79:26.79]Every single one of these is going to get done.
[79:28.97]It's just which one do you want to see first.
[79:32.99]It's either going to be Dinosaur Week, Game Show Week, or Western Week.
[79:35.61]Which one do you want to see first?
[79:36.77]Because we are going to do them all.
[79:39.99]All of them.
[79:42.74]But yeah.
[79:44.40]Thank you so much.
[79:46.94]I'll see you guys all on Thursday.
[79:49.80]The internet seems to be working fine again.
[79:52.28]Everything seems to be in working order.
[79:54.32]I don't have any dropped frames tonight, so apparently Comcast fixed the problem and it stayed that way.
[80:00.06]We're still loading, I guess.
[80:01.58]Yeah.
[80:03.28]I'm just gonna, like, exit the game.
[80:04.36]Because, like, this... What's the point of doing that now?
[80:07.50]Here we are.
[80:08.00]There we go.
[80:11.24]But, yeah.
[80:12.18]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[80:13.44]We're good to go.
[80:14.94]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream.
[80:15.78]That, like, movie thing.
[80:17.09]The night shift.
[80:19.29]I'm actually... I'm gonna give that a recommend.
[80:21.19]I'm gonna stamp the recommended on it.
[80:24.89]Just because.
[80:26.67]For ten bucks.
[80:27.99]Like...
[80:29.60]Was it cheeky?
[80:30.42]Was it like cheesy and like dumb?
[80:31.80]Of course it was.
[80:34.20]But that shit was like pretty funny.
[80:35.48]And for like 10 bucks, if there's like seven different endings, like... I don't know.
[80:38.75]I feel like you and your friends could like have a blast just like fucking around and like laughing about the game and stuff.
[80:44.55]So.
[80:45.99]For 10 bucks... Might be worth fucking around.
[80:52.33]Everybody loves dinos.
[80:57.10]Yeah, it's going to be close.
[80:58.48]Western Week seems to be losing very badly, but it's going to be Dinosaur Waco Game Show Week.
[81:03.91]Take care, guys.
[81:04.43]I'll see you soon.
[81:05.59]Thanks for watching again.
[81:07.59]Make sure I didn't miss any large donations or anything.
[81:09.92]Well, did I?
[81:11.30]No, I didn't.
[81:13.70]Again, for subs, for resubs, I know I have not been acknowledging them on stream.
[81:19.73]But very soon here in the next couple weeks, there's going to be a new system where it's just on screen pretty much at all times.
[81:26.43]It's small in the corner.
[81:28.25]And it'll be much easier for me to see it and to be able to have it there.
[81:33.11]Thinking of solutions.
[81:35.49]Thank you so much.
[81:36.79]Good night.
[81:37.27]Goodbye.
[81:37.95]And good luck.
[81:39.46]See you Thursday.
[82:02.18]you
