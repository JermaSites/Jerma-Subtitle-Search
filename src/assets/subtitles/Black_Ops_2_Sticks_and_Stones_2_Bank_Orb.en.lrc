[00:01.45]What is my deal?
[00:03.77]For every video that you upload with the clan tag Berg, the Berg CEO of Berg Industries gives you $5,000.
[00:10.64]$5,000?
[00:10.93]Yeah.
[00:15.90]Now, we're talking about the CEO of Berg Associates.
[00:18.76]Like, this is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[00:22.72]Yeah, I can clearly tell that this is serious stuff.
[00:25.91]But you have to give me time.
[00:26.99]I have to, you know, talk this over with my agent.
[00:29.03]Well, in each upload, I forgot to mention, this is part of the stipulation, in each upload, you have to be completely naked.
[00:35.31]And there has to be a facecam on you.
[00:37.34]Like, on your naked body.
[00:38.84]I'm totally fine with that.
[00:41.14]Even if you've got, like, flags and you've got them removed?
[00:44.28]No, but I mean, can I do the uploads on livejasmin.com?
[00:47.65]Is that okay?
[00:48.73]It has to be on YouTube.
[00:53.75]You can make like separate accounts.
[00:55.25]Yeah, I guess I will have to do that.
[00:57.75]Somebody actually has it.
[01:01.78]Somebody actually has it.
[01:03.16]No, really, are you kidding?
[01:04.36]Somebody actually has the McDonald's logo.
[01:08.10]I find that hilarious.
[01:10.22]No!
[01:12.99]Well, Orb is off to a great start here.
[01:14.93]He is going big.
[01:16.11]Going ham.
[01:18.17]I'm in the middle, guys.
[01:19.15]Come fight me.
[01:19.67]I keep getting it.
[01:20.23]That left click is not like melee.
[01:21.99]I keep trying to left click and I throw a friggin' blade at the wall.
[01:27.46]How does that make you feel?
[01:28.60]You're getting excited now, but you ain't gonna feel like that.
[01:32.03]I am getting very excited.
[01:33.93]Oh, I missed him!
[01:34.77]Oh, you didn't even throw it.
[01:37.27]On my screen, I did.
[01:38.43]No, not on my screen.
[01:40.15]You're just holding it for really long.
[01:41.75]Yeah, it's my Sweden ping, bro.
[01:45.29]Okay, so now the ping game starts.
[01:48.07]Yeah, it's like, come on, my ping sucks, dude.
[01:51.26]My control is broken.
[01:52.52]Dude, totally, dude.
[01:55.24]My A button on my controller doesn't work, like I don't know.
[01:58.51]On your controller?
[01:59.35]The controller's like broken.
[02:00.63]That's the oldest excuse in the book.
[02:06.39]You actually invented that excuse.
[02:08.84]Back in the day.
[02:10.18]Oh, hey dude!
[02:11.14]Ah!
[02:11.74]Dammit!
[02:12.82]No!
[02:13.58]Oh, I thought you backed me.
[02:14.38]I thought you backed me first.
[02:15.44]You shit yourself then, didn't you?
[02:17.06]Incredible!
[02:19.24]It's so bad too, because I'm doing the... the climb maneuver.
[02:23.59]Because I can't do anything while I'm climbing.
[02:27.07]Okay, meet me, listen, okay?
[02:28.73]Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[02:31.47]I don't know where the statue is.
[02:32.73]I don't play this game.
[02:33.75]Oh, wait, I'm gonna bang.
[02:35.03]No!
[02:35.41]What?
[02:35.71]Oh, what was that?
[02:36.53]You were gonna bang?
[02:37.09]What?
[02:37.39]What were you gonna do?
[02:38.13]You were gonna bang me?
[02:38.95]Is that what you did?
[02:39.69]Oh, okay, I'm good for you.
[02:41.43]Oh, there we go.
[02:45.42]Okay, now meet me at the statue.
[02:47.64]Meet me at the stat- I'm at the statue.
[02:50.08]I didn't know you- You said, meet me at the statue.
[02:52.28]You didn't say I'm gonna kill you at the statue.
[02:54.04]I'm like, just stand here.
[02:55.76]Okay, I'm on the statue.
[02:58.02]Meet me at the statue.
[02:59.16]That means, like, we're gonna, like, hang out.
[03:00.82]Not you're gonna throw a knife at my head.
[03:04.61]Alright, where are you?
[03:05.15]You were just... Oh!
[03:06.51]Oh, look at that!
[03:07.19]Look at that kill cam!
[03:08.09]Look at that kill cam!
[03:08.93]What did I just do to you?
[03:10.63]What did I just do to you?
[03:11.47]I came to the statue!
[03:12.53]I'm still trying to be your friend!
[03:14.43]What?
[03:15.69]What are you doing?
[03:16.37]You're the worst... I mean, you're the best opponent ever, I mean... Oh, now you see, when you talk... When you break the friendship trust, meet at the statue queue, now you're getting bankrupt.
[03:25.92]That's gotta happen in this game.
[03:27.14]What did you expect?
[03:27.96]That we were gonna hug and, like, talk?
[03:29.46]No, I thought we were gonna, like, be weird.
[03:31.04]Alright, you know what?
[03:32.18]Watch this.
[03:33.02]Watch this!
[03:36.34]Where are you?
[03:37.52]Is there a guy right here?
[03:38.76]Yeah, I'm right here.
[03:40.76]Oh, you slag!
[03:42.86]Somebody was behind you, too.
[03:44.48]Alright, Boo.
[03:45.60]We're gonna have to kill him.
[03:47.60]Well, once again, Orb is in the lead here with quite a solid 125 points.
[03:53.06]It looks like another victory here for Orb.
[03:55.72]He is going to try and not really play it cool.
[03:58.06]This guy...
[04:00.01]Only Orb will shellcast his own live gameplay.
[04:03.13]This guy's gonna feel like total shit very shortly.
[04:05.28]Yeah, you know what?
[04:06.70]Boo, are you ready for this one?
[04:08.16]It took me two games.
[04:08.98]Oh, that wasn't even him.
[04:10.04]That was not even him.
[04:10.84]Now I'm ready.
[04:12.06]I'm gonna slap you with my axe.
[04:14.38]No, I'm sorry, Boo!
[04:15.76]You!
[04:16.44]What?!
[04:17.58]How could you?
[04:18.84]I thought it was him!
[04:20.52]Okay, come to the statue now.
[04:21.69]Fight me, Jerma.
[04:22.79]And Boo.
[04:23.21]Hey, hey, shh.
[04:24.21]Hey, Boo.
[04:24.77]Don't shoot me.
[04:26.61]I didn't mean to.
[04:28.88]I'm by the statue.
[04:30.00]Come here, guys.
[04:30.66]Hey, Boo, I'm Charlie.
[04:32.45]I'm by the statue, guys.
[04:33.51]Where are you guys?
[04:34.93]Me and Boo have a mission right now to come and destroy you.
[04:38.35]You're really pre-aiming me?
[04:40.85]Really?
[04:41.13]I don't know what you're talking about.
[04:42.97]Okay, I see how it is.
[04:44.39]I see how we're going to play this.
[04:45.41]Oh, shit.
[04:49.22]I'm going... No, no, no.
[04:51.38]I don't have anything.
[04:52.20]Where is he?
[04:53.18]No, no, no.
[04:55.55]Behind you, what are you doing?
[04:56.79]I don't know where he is.
[05:00.03]I was behind you for the longest time.
[05:01.79]I missed everything.
[05:05.55]Well, 145 points, guys.
[05:07.08]I'm gonna put this hatchet up your asshole.
[05:10.30]I believe we have another W in the vicinity.
[05:14.42]Gemma, we got 40 seconds.
[05:15.92]Please make him count.
[05:17.34]I'm not even throwing.
[05:18.04]I'm trying to find him.
[05:18.58]We've come to that part of the game again where I like to talk.
[05:23.65]145 points on the scoreboard here, and it's looking like it's got to be another victory here.
[05:30.32]He's been playing consistently throughout this tournament, and he is going to... It's already... It's got to be a victory here.
[05:40.46]He's going to walk around and try to let the opponent back him here.
[05:45.29]No, mate!
[05:46.59]Jesus!
[05:48.05]Yes!
[05:48.37]What a hero that guy is.
[05:51.11]Listen, I don't believe in... It lagged.
[05:54.73]I lagged right there.
[05:56.77]I lagged.
[05:57.55]Oh yeah.
[05:58.41]Dude, I played like shit in this game.
[06:01.04]And I got second place.
[06:02.84]Nice host, I lag.
[06:04.50]I lag, guys.
[06:05.40]Okay.
[06:06.58]I got bankrupted right here.
[06:08.08]Someone throws a tomahawk at me right here.
[06:09.62]Are you gonna DDoS me right now, guys?
[06:12.65]Are you that apt to win?
[06:14.63]You're gonna DDoS me?
[06:16.89]See how it is.
[06:18.31]I think I won that right at the end and then I got bankrupt with one second left.
[06:22.68]Jeremiah, what happened to our... Don't you remember all the times we met at the statue?
[06:27.44]Yeah, remember to meet me at the statue so I can punch you in the face.
[06:30.27]That's like what happened.
[06:31.43]Did that mean nothing to you?
[06:32.55]Meet me at the flagpole after school.
[06:34.51]I'm gonna put like an icicle up your ass.
