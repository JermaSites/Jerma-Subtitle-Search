[00:34.32]What do they say?
[00:34.96]A stone Mason is never late.
[00:40.62]They're never early.
[00:42.62]A stone Mason starts to lay the brick down precisely when he is getting paid to go to work.
[00:48.16]8 a.m.
[00:56.83]What's that?
[00:57.19]What's that?
[00:57.57]What's that go?
[00:59.40]A milkmaid is never early.
[01:01.70]Never late.
[01:02.19]A milkman is precisely ready to eat that string cheese when exactly when he is asked to.
[01:08.37]How you guys doing?
[01:16.19]It's me, Jerma.
[01:16.87]Oh, hi.
[01:18.58]Got a small story to tell you.
[01:21.00]Not right now.
[01:22.54]We'll get into it in a moment.
[01:25.20]But I'm gonna go grab a drink.
[01:27.08]Hang tight.
[01:30.40]I will see you guys in about one or two moments.
[01:33.13]Give me a moment.
[01:33.69]I'll see you in one.
[01:34.45]I'll see you in a moment.
[03:28.18]I'll just make a tweet.
[03:31.02]And we will get on our merry way on trying to finish Harvester.
[03:39.76]I know it might sound like I'm playing a guitar or tuning a violin right there, but I promise you I'm eating string cheese.
[03:46.52]I don't know why, either.
[03:55.42]Let's change this.
[04:02.45]Am I going to do face cam?
[04:03.41]I don't think so.
[04:05.37]Not tonight.
[04:08.17]I have a piece of trash tonight.
[04:11.43]We'll talk about why.
[04:21.36]I'm like a dirty shithead.
[04:24.44]You're a dirty boy!
[04:26.14]You're a dirty boy!
[04:29.78]I actually woke up like 98 seconds ago.
[04:35.27]Bear with me here.
[04:49.34]I called it.
[04:50.61]And guess what?
[04:51.25]We weren't fucking late.
[04:52.61]We weren't late by one second.
[04:54.89]I was ready.
[04:55.47]I was here.
[05:01.77]Sometimes you... You know when you're... No, no, no.
[05:03.57]Wait, wait.
[05:03.97]We'll talk.
[05:04.27]Hold on.
[05:04.67]Let's do Finishing Harvester.
[05:13.65]And... Then... Condemned...
[05:18.37]two with the thinking face thinking yeah finishing harvester and then condemned to possibly ee
[05:45.99]That's perfect for me.
[05:47.35]That's a good enough tweet for me.
[05:48.41]Fucking Twitter.
[05:58.04]Alright, let's move over to this.
[06:00.32]You're going to see the wrong day here, but you know, sorry about that.
[06:08.14]Is it T-H-E-N or T-H-A-N?
[06:12.60]Is it?
[06:14.14]Finishing Harvest... Finishing... Finishing... Finishing Harvester and then Condemned 2.
[06:20.11]T-H-E-N, right?
[06:23.99]Yeah.
[06:24.57]Of course.
[06:34.12]Mm-hmm.
[06:39.59]Oh, shit.
[06:49.90]I knew what it was the first time.
[06:50.98]I already did it.
[07:00.71]Sorry, I'm wearing clothes.
[07:04.41]Nothing happened.
[07:05.81]Guys, don't worry.
[07:11.83]By the way, guys, I've got a problem.
[07:14.16]I was thinking about this the other day.
[07:17.04]I got a prime insult for anybody that you think is, like, boring.
[07:24.52]Or, like, you think, like, sucks.
[07:26.83]You know, like, if somebody, like, cuts you off and you pull up, you know, somebody cuts off in front of you and pulls up, you guys pull up to the same red light and you look over, they look over, the inevitable awkward, like, that, like, I'm rolling my window down.
[07:46.05]You know what the easiest, the best thing you could ever say to somebody that's doing that to you?
[07:50.03]That's like, hey, fuck you, you suck.
[07:52.81]One of them, there you go.
[07:54.71]You save right back to him.
[07:57.75]Yeah, yeah, that's great, that's great.
[07:59.67]Hey, dude, you're as fucking boring as unsweetened iced tea.
[08:03.45]And then, like, step on the fucking gas and pull it.
[08:07.55]Oh, my computer crashed.
[08:11.83]Wait.
[08:18.66]Oh my god.
[08:23.78]What the fuck?
[08:24.60]Are we already starting the technical problems?
[08:32.53]No, that's fine.
[08:40.43]Because who fucking drinks unsweetened iced tea?
[08:43.26]Who likes unsweetened iced tea?
[08:46.46]Nobody does.
[08:48.67]Not one person does.
[08:50.01]They just say they do, so you think that they're like health conscious.
[08:54.85]Trust me.
[08:58.35]I do.
[08:58.63]No, you don't.
[09:00.21]No, you actually don't like it.
[09:02.68]Let's go here.
[09:08.30]I drink it every day.
[09:09.14]No, you don't.
[09:10.10]I don't believe that.
[09:12.76]Alright, where are we going?
[09:17.65]Hey, guess what I'm drinking right now?
[09:25.17]Unsweetened iced tea.
[09:34.46]This really fucking is.
[09:36.66]I swear to god.
[09:37.37]Alright, let's go.
[09:38.99]Wait, first let me get the fucking game genie up on the other screen.
[09:44.47]Hold on.
[09:47.40]Just in case something terrible happens.
[09:54.23]And so, let me just tell you.
[09:57.37]The reason why we didn't play this yesterday, which is, that was the plan, was due to the fact that I don't think we have more than like an hour or two in the game.
[10:09.89]What a shitty joke.
[10:11.07]I'm not making a joke.
[10:12.45]I don't even like it.
[10:13.87]This is all I have in the house right now.
[10:17.34]It was an accidental unsweetened iced tea buy.
[10:23.70]It was.
[10:23.98]I'm not going to pretend I'm a genius.
[10:27.16]You go to the store and you grab.
[10:29.86]They're all labeled the same damn thing.
[10:31.72]You walk up and you fucking grab one.
[10:34.14]Accidental unsweetened iced tea buy.
[10:35.87]They put them there so you accidentally fucking buy them.
[10:43.37]Anyways.
[10:45.94]We are here.
[10:47.44]That looks good.
[10:51.94]Yes it does.
[10:54.66]Hey Fa- I gotta like start playing the game.
[10:56.98]Alright.
[10:59.16]Hey Faison, thanks for the two bucks.
[11:01.10]Is the- can you guys hear this?
[11:02.88]Yes.
[11:04.54]Thank you Faison for the two dollars.
[11:08.26]Yes, I wasn't joking.
[11:09.31]Steve, the main character's actor in Real Life Scott, arrested.
[11:13.93]Well, that's fucking... That's fucking... Messed up.
[11:18.37]Control-F4.
[11:20.31]And left mouse button.
[11:22.51]We're going to finish this game.
[11:23.79]We don't have very much time left in it, so... Oh, Jesus Christ.
[11:30.61]I'm outside of the school with an axe.
[11:33.67]Is that where we were?
[11:36.90]But thank you, Faison.
[11:37.70]Thank you, Aquafox, for the three bucks.
[11:39.10]Jeremy, you're my favorite person ever.
[11:40.26]I've been watching you for years.
[11:42.29]You've especially helped me through the past month with a cancer scare.
[11:45.39]Keep being the best boy ever.
[11:47.53]Well, hopefully when you say cancer scare, you mean that everything's alright, hopefully.
[11:59.68]Thank you so much, Aqua.
[12:03.44]Obviously, wish you the best of luck.
[12:05.95]And hopefully that's a scare and not anything more than that.
[12:11.99]I actually, I've been there with a scare before.
[12:16.72]In regards to that stuff.
[12:20.40]Fuck cancer man, seriously.
[12:28.58]Reload earlier and go to the bake sale.
[12:31.42]Do I have to?
[12:34.22]Turn back from the face cam on.
[12:36.11]You'll see my like fucking terrible posture.
[12:41.40]My posture sucks right now.
[12:43.60]I can't fix it.
[12:44.45]I need to go upside down on one of those hang-up machines.
[12:50.07]You know, you can be careful.
[12:51.97]If you do a hang-up machine for too long, it can kill you.
[12:58.37]You go upside down and the blood rushes to your head.
[13:00.62]Uh...
[13:08.37]Alright, fine.
[13:09.41]I'll do it.
[13:10.75]No, you're not going to like it.
[13:11.93]I can promise you that.
[13:13.33]You're not going to like it.
[13:15.39]Give me a second.
[13:18.56]One minute.
[13:46.45]Thank you.
[14:37.83]you
[15:07.19]Thank you.
[16:00.23]Just spent like fucking five minutes looking for a shirt.
[16:04.75]Apparently I don't have a fucking shirt.
[16:09.45]That's not this.
[16:10.25]See you in 60 seconds.
[16:21.09]There you go.
[16:30.75]If I look like a fucking piece of crap right now, who cares?
[16:33.41]Who cares?
[16:34.21]We're playing Harvester.
[16:38.13]Alright.
[16:41.95]Uh, what?
[16:42.53]Okay, the lodge, right?
[16:44.21]This is where we're going next.
[16:45.97]Have I got any fucking boogers on my mouth?
[16:49.52]The diner's no more.
[16:50.04]Yes, that's right.
[16:50.54]Cover that armpit.
[16:51.38]Don't!
[16:51.50]I think we're gonna come to the stream and think I'm a dickhead.
[16:53.98]Hold on.
[16:54.72]I need to... I'm gonna make a t-shirt out of this.
[17:17.32]Uh, I had no idea that she'd do that.
[17:19.40]You bastards, you've made me a murderer.
[17:21.06]Uh, I had no idea.
[17:26.59]This is just a fucking BIP.
[17:28.81]Get this-
[17:49.69]To hell with this, I'm no longer a candidate.
[17:51.33]I thought I was this... Okay, yeah, this is the whole thing.
[17:53.88]I think I got time, Barrett.
[17:55.22]I got time.
[17:55.68]There we go.
[17:56.22]Be patient.
[17:56.62]Protocols must be observed before initiation may commence.
[18:01.78]How I recognize this sign...
[18:17.18]You will know when you receive the invitation.
[18:20.98]Here we go, now I got a t-shirt on.
[18:22.90]And your initiation shall begin.
[18:26.20]Now I'm just wearing like hockey equipment from the 30s.
[18:29.57]That's what they used to do.
[18:32.69]Ah, you don't need to have any leather helmets.
[18:36.61]Just wear paper towels, son.
[18:38.07]Alright, uh, what do I have to do?
[18:48.02]I can't move that much.
[18:49.28]Here we are.
[18:56.08]My terrible fucking t-shirt.
[18:58.17]I gotta like stuff it in the armpit.
[19:01.09]That's good.
[19:06.53]That's better.
[19:07.91]Now I'm just wearing swimmies.
[19:11.97]Imagine going to pool, mom!
[19:27.20]Too much shoulder.
[19:29.86]Oh, God damn it.
[19:32.90]Alright.
[19:34.78]We already, okay, we went to Edna, the Edna thing.
[19:41.30]Okay.
[19:48.54]Alright, what about, TV station.
[19:55.01]This is new.
[19:56.62]This is new, so we're gonna save this game.
[20:01.74]This one's gonna be called... We start here Monday, even though it is Tuesday.
[20:07.77]It's Tuesday, so we're gonna do Batman and Robin.
[20:13.59]Sounds good to me.
[20:17.64]Alright, uh, let's talk to Range Rider.
[20:20.45]Say, can you spare a dime for a buckaroo who's down on his luck?
[20:25.23]What happened?
[20:26.63]The whole shebang just went up in flames.
[20:29.07]And I'm looking to mow the lawn to greener pastures.
[20:32.02]Where the sun sets always golden, and there's always another savage to kill.
[20:36.68]Okay, well, he's now... I'm trying to do this again.
[20:46.12]Why is he?
[20:47.33]What happened to the TV station?
[20:50.83]Silver Tucker with the yellow interior.
[20:52.69]Say, can you die?
[20:54.05]What happened?
[20:55.31]Do I have any money?
[21:03.57]Glue.
[21:08.14]This is just Fallout now.
[21:11.12]Fallout 3.
[21:12.16]New Vegas.
[21:13.97]Alright, it's all boarded up.
[21:14.93]I can't do anything.
[21:15.51]Should I just kill this guy?
[21:16.29]Does this guy serve a purpose anymore?
[21:19.01]Should I wrench him in the head?
[21:23.35]What about his signature?
[21:27.00]Uh, I don't know.
[21:31.68]I guess I don't do anything with him here.
[21:34.28]Hey, remember when you were, like, not, like, Freddy Krueger?
[21:38.62]You want your autograph?
[21:39.60]Ahem.
[21:43.71]Let's go up.
[21:46.77]Abandoned house.
[21:49.47]Is the bug lady still in here?
[21:50.51]Is she still here?
[21:55.89]What if her house is burnt down too?
[21:59.97]No.
[22:03.43]What about my girlfriend?
[22:09.01]No, my girlfriend's not in here.
[22:10.19]This is this guy.
[22:13.51]Just make a toga.
[22:16.39]What the fuck is going on here?
[22:22.60]Okay, well, I think this is where we're supposed to be.
[22:27.80]Hey, when you... Hey, that feeling when... Hey, that reaction when WTF when you can use your shirt as a little bit of a spittle device.
[22:36.68]Ha!
[22:41.22]Examine the picture of the man of the house squeezing his beat.
[22:45.84]Gross.
[22:46.10]Uh, well, she looks normal.
[22:50.64]Why?
[22:51.14]What?
[22:51.28]What's going on?
[22:52.22]Okay.
[22:52.58]Wash your hair?
[22:53.26]I just woke up!
[22:55.85]Look!
[22:56.37]Listen to me!
[23:12.14]I didn't want to turn the camera on.
[23:13.96]I just woke up.
[23:16.04]I was taking a nap, and my hair's gonna be disgusting.
[23:19.66]This is how it works when you have disgusting, greasy, fucking smelly body.
[23:25.01]You get like this.
[23:27.21]And the way that the sun, the way that the indoor sun is hitting me in the head...
[23:34.16]I took a nap.
[23:35.04]I went to bed at like 6.15 and woke up at like 6.58 and came down here.
[23:41.19]I woke up at like 7 o'clock this morning.
[23:44.75]I was just tired, that's all.
[23:45.87]Alright, let's go upstairs and see what happens.
[23:51.59]Alright, there's the fat guy.
[23:52.89]I probably should save this.
[23:56.99]Because this guy is going to cause a problem.
[24:00.11]This one's going to be called Barber.
[24:04.34]Problem egg.
[24:05.72]Yeah.
[24:10.00]What's he gonna say?
[24:10.82]Guess I can forget about the meat, huh?
[24:13.56]What do you mean?
[24:14.97]Your dad must have pulled some strings.
[24:18.27]Be sure and check Stephanie's pillow, you lucky bum.
[24:21.77]Check the pillow?
[24:22.21]What the hell are you talking about?
[24:23.17]What are you, the fucking tooth fairy?
[24:24.57]You'll see once the sheriff gets here.
[24:28.89]Stephanie, Stephanie.
[24:31.85]Things will never be the same now.
[24:34.93]Guess I'll be watching TV nights.
[24:40.63]Okay, you can come in now, son.
[24:44.21]What?
[24:49.22]My God.
[24:51.44]Is that what I think it is?
[24:52.72]Why is she a skeleton?
[24:53.96]It's a spinal cord.
[24:55.48]Is it Stephanie?
[24:58.72]I can see a resemblance, but I can't be sure.
[25:02.82]More pie, Sheriff?
[25:05.69]pie don't you realize what's happened oh indeed I do I can just hear the tongues wagging at the pta was it suicide never heard of anyone pulling their own spinal cord out before off the record I'd have to say no
[25:30.84]No, all in all, I'd say this was death by natural causes.
[25:35.78]Death by natural causes?
[25:37.26]Natural causes?
[25:38.90]What the fuck?
[25:41.03]You can't live without a spinal cord, son.
[25:44.19]Nothing unnatural about that.
[25:46.19]No, you cannot.
[25:47.63]Think I will have some more pie.
[25:52.79]Is this the end of the game?
[25:53.83]Did I beat the game?
[25:55.53]I can't believe this.
[25:57.87]This is horrible.
[26:02.45]Believe me, you get to the point to where this is routine.
[26:09.94]So they eat the pies made out of people, right?
[26:11.54]The only clue we got is that card on our pillow.
[26:15.02]It's the Lodge.
[26:15.96]Take a look at it.
[26:20.20]Harvest Buddhist Steve Mason.
[26:22.52]Stone Mason.
[26:24.86]This is practically a confession.
[26:26.60]Confession to what, son?
[26:29.15]Murder.
[26:29.89]Isn't that what you're here to investigate?
[26:33.22]Son, you don't investigate natural deaths.
[26:35.68]I could do a better job than this.
[26:37.84]I feel like this is that Movies 2 game.
[26:40.28]You know what I mean?
[26:40.96]That's a guy doing a Movies 2 shtick.
[26:43.46]I'm sure you will.
[26:48.05]More pie, Sheriff?
[26:49.07]Fucking Tim and Eric.
[26:52.45]Don't mind if I do.
[27:06.23]Okay, well, um... What happens if I, uh... What happens if I start axing people now?
[27:18.55]No, go back in there.
[27:23.57]I don't think I can start axing now.
[27:27.23]My ax opportunity, I think, left, like, about an hour ago in the game, because I can't really... Yeah, I can.
[27:35.42]I can't.
[27:37.35]Nope.
[27:39.19]Am I drinking blood?
[27:40.23]How would you think I was drinking blood?
[27:49.29]I've already been in here before.
[27:52.80]That's the wall picture.
[27:53.78]No, we need to go to the lodge.
[27:59.08]What do you want?
[28:00.58]You know, with a slaughterhouse full of meat in town, what kind of nutcase would steal a barber's pole?
[28:07.05]Oh well.
[28:08.21]Pastorelli won't need it where he is.
[28:10.69]God rest his soul.
[28:12.31]Those silly women down at the fire station are just incensed about losing some decorating stuff.
[28:20.96]Harvest will never be the same without DNA's diner.
[28:24.24]Or without DNA, for that matter.
[28:29.26]The sheriff and that guy's wife aren't going to do anything weird in here, are they?
[28:36.46]Operate the wall picture.
[28:37.52]No, I can't.
[28:40.22]Yeah, I could have really easily caught those two smooching.
[28:43.82]You know what I mean?
[28:45.02]Very easily.
[28:47.78]Floss.
[28:49.20]Toothpaste.
[28:50.80]Band-Aids.
[28:54.83]Disinfectant.
[28:57.27]Interestingly enough, this is all the stuff that I currently need right now.
[29:03.00]This is the shit that's all missing from my medicine cabinet right now.
[29:06.12]I need toothpaste.
[29:06.80]Didn't get it today.
[29:08.60]Ran out of band-aids.
[29:10.32]And need some floss.
[29:11.96]Thanks, game, for reminding me.
[29:12.98]Appreciate it.
[29:13.42]Alright, let's go to the lodge.
[29:18.86]Let's finish this game.
[29:26.61]Back door?
[29:27.97]Bushes are preventing it from being open.
[29:29.39]What about the fridge?
[29:31.77]Just get out of here.
[29:34.57]Ugh!
[29:35.34]Okay.
[29:36.36]Uh, come on, give me the exit.
[29:42.18]So I gotta go to the lodge and be like, You did this, you son of a bitch!
[29:46.00]Right?
[29:46.58]There you go.
[29:49.10]Uh... Uh, I have the invitation.
[29:57.57]Candidate, candidate, candidate.
[29:58.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:00.09]How I... Okay, pull it up.
[30:04.76]Where is my invitation?
[30:11.31]Where's my invitation?
[30:12.11]Wasn't it just sitting there?
[30:17.77]What?
[30:18.71]Where's my invitation?
[30:28.06]Oh, okay.
[30:28.52]I have no idea.
[30:29.10]You know, I have to brush my teeth once a week?
[30:33.53]Why would you brush your teeth once a week?
[30:37.09]I didn't leave it on the bed, did I?
[30:38.39]I don't believe that for a moment.
[30:44.51]I don't believe that for one single moment.
[30:49.47]I could be wrong.
[30:51.05]Wrong house.
[30:59.81]Can I not remember which fucking house I'm going in?
[31:04.91]And that's the general store.
[31:06.01]This is my house.
[31:09.22]Still haven't gotten the frisbee on the... I still haven't gotten the pizza.
[31:13.98]Don't think so.
[31:14.46]Shut up, you little shit!
[31:16.42]I guess I'm going to a funeral instead.
[31:25.88]Don't hold your breath.
[31:26.52]I'm not sure it's her.
[31:27.82]Let's go with number two.
[31:28.74]You're disgusting.
[31:30.39]I'm not telling you anything.
[31:31.43]Yeah.
[31:31.93]Jesus.
[31:42.57]This is an actual kid reading this line.
[31:45.77]This is a kid reading this.
[31:47.41]That's not an actress or an actor.
[31:49.17]Shut up.
[31:49.53]You're no fun anymore.
[31:51.73]You need to loosen up.
[31:52.87]Watch some more TV.
[31:53.71]Or you're gonna wind up like me.
[31:54.94]Watch a little more TV.
[31:55.62]What?
[32:12.63]Why are you sitting in front of that blank TV?
[32:15.65]Someone burnt down the TV channel.
[32:18.55]There's nothing on.
[32:20.49]Nothing on.
[32:22.01]Honestly, Hank, you're acting like an alcoholic.
[32:25.19]I told you all that TV would hurt you.
[32:27.79]Watching TV don't hurt me, Mom.
[32:30.39]But not watching TV... Gives me strength.
[32:32.63]Hurts bad.
[32:34.11]If I find out who burnt down the TV station... Did I say it was me?
[32:37.82]I'll make him wish he was one of those damn Indians.
[32:41.06]Here we go.
[32:43.29]it was me say what I burnt down TV say what uh can can I just write like confess confess say what no whatever give him the autograph good we try to give I try to give him the autograph like way back in the beginning maybe this will work now big what Steve I don't give a okay
[33:13.23]Cookies.
[33:13.93]Hello mom.
[33:14.47]I just heard what happened to Stephanie.
[33:16.65]Would you like some toast from our brand new Crandall toaster with auto browning control?
[33:21.05]Okay Couldn't eat now.
[33:28.40]I don't know why they had to do a cutscene for that.
[33:29.82]I saw what was left of her.
[33:31.26]It was horrible.
[33:32.56]I'm sure it was dear.
[33:34.37]I guess this reshuffles the deck, doesn't it?
[33:36.24]What do you mean?
[33:37.14]Well, the wedding is all for one thing, and Mr. Potsdam must be so disappointed.
[33:43.17]Going to the bathroom will never be the same for him again.
[33:45.51]The nerve of some people burning down the TV station.
[33:49.62]I doubt the perpetrator did it just to annoy the Harvest PTA.
[33:53.63]Coincidence?
[33:54.69]I don't think so.
[33:55.83]Just six months ago, the newspaper building went up in smoke.
[33:59.01]Obviously, there's a firebug in the loose.
[34:01.01]Oh, either that or there's a communal here.
[34:03.89]Steve, I'm sorry.
[34:06.42]Uh, what's communism got to do with anything?
[34:08.10]Why are you so scared?
[34:08.82]How long am I gonna scream?
[34:10.08]Baby's crying.
[34:32.16]What what okay?
[34:34.72]Don't touch it.
[34:35.62]You don't call an ambulance Call an ambulance Call of the fireman That tarantula she ate must have had wasp eggs in it whoa we should get her to a doctor oh
[34:55.50]What for?
[34:56.69]She's got her mother.
[34:57.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[34:58.09]Don't call it... Call it priest.
[35:00.83]Just because there are no more cookies to bake.
[35:03.52]I can still rear my brood.
[35:06.06]This is a sign, Steve.
[35:07.42]I have a purpose again.
[35:11.05]Glad to see you're feeling better.
[35:13.06]mind that fire still burns my britches first the newspaper building then dna's diner then no no you know what it's a pattern call a priest any pattern dressed as a police officer
[35:26.47]who's currently volunteering as a firefighter.
[35:28.80]Fuck that one up, but you know what I mean.
[35:31.08]Call a priest who's dressed as a police officer, volunteering as a firefighter.
[35:37.46]I can't, you know, when people, I hear other voices, I can't talk.
[35:41.01]I'm being speech jammed.
[35:41.85]Alright, fuck off.
[35:49.23]Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.
[35:51.15]You know how he gets.
[35:52.15]That would have been funny if I wasn't getting fucking speech jammed in my ear.
[35:55.38]I should have just ripped it out.
[36:00.58]Hello, dear.
[36:01.70]Yeah, add extra dialog to this bitch.
[36:04.18]Get the fuck away from me.
[36:08.74]You soiled a perfect joke.
[36:12.12]That would have been in the video.
[36:13.22]Is there going to be a video for this?
[36:16.19]Maybe.
[36:16.75]You'll see.
[36:19.88]Get me out of here.
[36:24.52]He's hearing voices.
[36:26.75]Oh, no.
[36:27.13]He's hearing voices now.
[36:31.99]We already said the F word to the mother.
[36:34.03]We already saw what that was.
[36:35.19]I'll show you again.
[36:38.07]It's funny.
[36:39.81]See?
[36:39.97]Creepy, I know.
[36:40.31]You mind your mouth, young man.
[36:42.23]Don't forget to put the...
[36:50.63]Okay.
[36:51.57]So we got to see a gross scene.
[36:55.45]We got to see a terrible scene.
[36:56.81]That's good.
[36:57.45]I'm sure... I'm sure that will go down in history as one of, like, the worst images that's been recorded on a camera for a video game.
[37:08.88]But, you know, that's fine.
[37:10.00]Always take the paper.
[37:15.46]Well, what about... How's Dad doing?
[37:18.73]Is Dad still, like, alive?
[37:20.66]What?
[37:22.34]Oh.
[37:23.93]I guess not.
[37:24.63]Can I do anything?
[37:25.29]Can I do anything with Dad?
[37:30.29]Can I humpty dumpty him?
[37:32.75]I don't have time to look at your... Let's just get out of here then.
[37:40.38]Oh, by the way, if you're new, this is the first time you've been, if you weren't here on Friday.
[37:45.88]Not safe for work!
[37:51.10]Don't know why I said it like that.
[37:52.37]It was a little strange, but not safe for work if you're currently working right now.
[37:56.65]It's 730, but if you're working.
[38:00.01]Get out of here.
[38:01.13]At least have it if a tab opens.
[38:02.37]You can be like, Oh, not sorry.
[38:04.75]I was like working on the project there, boss.
[38:08.59]Not watching this random dickhead play Harvester.
[38:13.12]Alright, uh...
[38:17.10]Oh, you don't say.
[38:18.38]You don't say it's like an 18 plus stream.
[38:21.45]You don't say.
[38:22.25]What are we doing?
[38:33.41]Okay.
[38:36.38]So, yes.
[38:38.02]Yes, I do realize that I did not do this.
[38:43.16]The invitation's on the bed that I didn't pick up.
[38:47.45]Somehow.
[38:51.83]What are you doing?
[38:54.35]Forgetting about that meat, huh?
[38:57.07]What do you mean?
[39:01.10]You'll see once the sheriff gets here.
[39:04.00]Did we just do that?
[39:04.82]We already were here.
[39:06.38]Okay, you can come in now, son.
[39:09.69]We just saw this.
[39:12.31]I love how he looks over there.
[39:15.39]He walks in and looks that way, and then looks this way like, whoa, there's a body on that table.
[39:21.41]Wouldn't you like know immediately what the fuck was going on?
[39:23.81]Why would you need to look over here?
[39:26.23]Get the, uh, lodge invitation.
[39:28.99]Got it.
[39:29.77]Alright, go to the lodge.
[39:37.45]And let's walk in and get our ending cutscene.
[39:42.07]I know, I know there's like another hour left, I know.
[39:45.93]Alright, here it is.
[39:49.22]Lodge invitation.
[39:50.20]Looks like a cassette tape.
[39:53.22]You received the invitation, but you have not brought it.
[39:59.66]He looks at, what?
[40:01.91]I don't understand.
[40:02.75]The invitation was not a card.
[40:05.89]Looks like he was putting on 3D glasses, like looking through a kaleidoscope.
[40:10.09]It must be presented to me air.
[40:14.87]You have to go get her spinal cord.
[40:19.01]You expect me to steal the remains and bring them here?
[40:22.57]I expect nothing.
[40:24.47]What must unfold will.
[40:27.91]You were provided an invitation.
[40:31.55]Bring me the skull and spinal cord if you would pass to the world beyond.
[40:40.92]Well.
[40:42.54]Okay, Dr. Claw.
[40:44.50]Okay, Dr. Claw.
[40:47.74]Still don't have the frisbee.
[40:49.60]I'm missing the secret ending.
[40:51.21]The frisbee ending.
[40:53.33]Where everybody's all... Everybody's alright and you just go out back and you play frisbee and nobody dies.
[41:00.15]It's not here.
[41:14.21]Did they stuff her in the trunk?
[41:15.45]Where is she?
[41:15.91]I have to go to the morgue, probably, I would assume, right?
[41:25.16]I would assume so.
[41:27.58]They already cleaned her up.
[41:42.55]you walk into a lodge and it's just Jimmy who pulls out a gun and kills you I wouldn't be surprised alright where is it the mortuary alright before no this is like the sem no no what do I need there he is young man we really have nothing to say to each other it seems that like some elephants graveyard people of low station come to harvest to die I demand axe time
[42:12.39]Like that corpse in the chapel.
[42:14.67]I'll dress... God knows by putting these people up at the Wayward Hotel, I do more than my fair share.
[42:21.23]So why must I pay for the coffins and burial materials as well?
[42:25.15]My losses to the dead are substantial.
[42:29.25]Your fiance's death was, no doubt, a tragic affair for those who knew her, loved her, and so forth.
[42:36.79]But to me, you simply can't get a nicer assignment.
[42:40.21]No organs left to remove, no fluids to drain, solvent parrots, and no coffin to fuss over.
[42:46.47]He's not here.
[42:48.17]I wish everybody could die as Stephanie did.
[42:50.53]Although it's true, only her.
[42:53.63]The WHAR fire is just another example of the vagaries of my profession.
[42:59.72]Why is everyone in this game fucked?
[43:01.56]Because this game is fucked.
[43:03.52]This game is just fucking messed up.
[43:05.88]Disappointing in a way.
[43:07.32]I might have gotten some paying customers.
[43:10.77]I stuck my hand in a wire and I got like wire goo on me.
[43:14.39]Hold on.
[43:14.79]Here we go.
[43:17.25]Corpse.
[43:17.63]Where's their corpse?
[43:18.65]The corpse reclining in the chapel right now is a prime example.
[43:22.13]Just like that.
[43:23.24]Indeed.
[43:25.16]But why come to harvest to die?
[43:27.80]You say this happens often.
[43:30.11]Isn't that a... I've often puzzled over the situation myself.
[43:34.37]That talks too much.
[43:35.49]Though I can assure you, young man, that nothing untoward is happening in Harvest.
[43:40.33]On the contrary, it's an indication of our compassion that I put up hobos in the Wayward Hotel.
[43:46.50]And the order of the Harvest Moon mandates their prompt burial, even when they are with... Alright, well, so she's not here.
[43:53.64]Is she already being buried?
[43:54.98]I'd say it's been a pleasure, but
[43:59.97]Oops, he spilled.
[44:00.63]Alright, let's go.
[44:06.21]Cemetery.
[44:10.27]No?
[44:13.19]Here lies Stephanie.
[44:17.09]No, that's Jonathan.
[44:21.55]Stephanie?
[44:24.21]Stephanie?
[44:26.84]These doors don't open.
[44:28.48]Come on.
[44:33.72]Stephanie.
[44:34.88]Here lies boxcar Willy.
[44:39.66]Unknown visitor.
[44:44.94]So where the hell is this person?
[44:51.88]Fresh soil.
[44:52.62]Do I have to dig down?
[44:55.92]Robbo Williams.
[44:57.83]Unnamed hobo.
[45:02.56]She's inside the tomb.
[45:07.84]Like, up here, you mean.
[45:10.02]Like, up here.
[45:12.60]Oh, the Potsdam Family Crypt.
[45:14.22]Alright, you said that, that, alright.
[45:16.96]How the, how the fuck do I do this?
[45:25.91]Like, is this what the ladder is for?
[45:33.88]Wow.
[45:34.48]Okay.
[45:37.12]Wow.
[45:38.04]Tree.
[45:39.42]I have a ladder in my inventory.
[45:42.14]Dim light shines upon the roof.
[45:43.58]Okay.
[45:43.96]I gotta like break into this right?
[45:52.56]Dim light.
[45:53.28]So I just smash it.
[45:56.66]Just take your two hands overhead and just throw the axe into it at this point.
[46:03.82]Okay, well that didn't work.
[46:09.00]What am I doing up here?
[46:10.68]Oh, tape!
[46:11.24]Remember how we break in?
[46:12.25]Damn it.
[46:12.93]Well that didn't work.
[46:14.23]That's not how you do it.
[46:15.19]Alright, shovel.
[46:17.15]Pitchfork.
[46:19.77]Wrench.
[46:21.89]Alright, we just had to use a... Did I throw it?
[46:24.66]Did it do what I wanted it to do?
[46:26.18]No.
[46:26.34]Alright, let's go.
[46:28.16]I'm assuming I can just walk in there.
[46:32.35]What is it?
[46:32.95]A dim light?
[46:33.61]No.
[46:34.79]I must need the ladder again.
[46:36.85]Well, this is a very useful ladder.
[46:38.27]Well, that didn't work.
[46:39.51]Well, that didn't work.
[46:45.23]Hello?
[46:49.62]Combat!
[46:50.48]We just got co- What is this dog?! !
[46:55.86]Alright, am I gonna have to fight like a bunch of dogs now?
[47:03.84]Alright.
[47:07.59]If that was supposed to be scary.
[47:09.87]The sarcophagus.
[47:11.13]A nauseating smell wafts from within the unsealed sarcophagus.
[47:17.53]I think she's just in here.
[47:21.96]There it is.
[47:22.42]Spinal cord and skull.
[47:24.02]Pick it up.
[47:26.08]She was being protected by a dog.
[47:28.33]An evil dog.
[47:30.97]That's it.
[47:37.47]I thought I was going to have to do a little bit of dungeon crawling and make my way to the center like Binding of Isaac style.
[47:42.96]Apparently not.
[47:48.04]We got what we needed.
[47:48.88]Time to go.
[47:52.59]Axe saved us once again.
[47:53.93]Did you guys hear that?
[47:54.51]That was like...
[47:55.82]It was like a horn coming out of my mouth.
[48:01.10]How's my health?
[48:03.42]Alright.
[48:04.18]Stoned.
[48:04.74]I'm good.
[48:09.18]Okay.
[48:10.12]Save.
[48:16.04]Escape.
[48:20.55]Escape.
[48:21.03]There we go.
[48:21.55]Save game.
[48:23.94]I'm going to call this one post dog.
[48:32.00]Okay, I'm ready.
[48:33.18]Here you go.
[48:34.86]Spinal cord.
[48:43.68]Is there any other option than kill the dog?
[48:45.81]I think you have to kill the dog.
[48:47.49]Nice, I got some loot.
[48:49.75]I just got a purple dagger.
[48:53.31]Oh wow, clearly cardboard sprayed with spray paint.
[49:07.02]You must now enter the lodge.
[49:10.82]Initiates find it a hostile place.
[49:14.66]Are you supposed to help me or get me killed?
[49:16.34]Are you supposed to help me here, man?
[49:17.66]I'm starting you on the path of initiation to a very special, very exclusive problem.
[49:25.95]Dude, exclusive.
[49:27.65]I am merely the administrator of a desert.
[49:30.25]Almost as exclusive as...
[49:33.31]being a sub I'm sorry you haven't said what it is I'm sorry special weapon use I missed this whole thing by the heart of the initiation

[50:27.60]You will find the answers you seek.
[50:39.83]or prompting your answer, depending on how you look at it.
[50:43.52]While the assumption is you want to live, dying is easy and provides its own answer, but not for you.
[50:56.30]Just tell me, is Stephanie dead or being held within?
[51:02.36]The second level keeps track of such things.
[51:07.23]Oh, great.
[51:08.37]Then you are a hyper today.
[51:09.67]It's because I just woke up.
[51:10.83]I am the sergeant at arms.
[51:14.02]I am here to ensure that the protocols are observed.
[51:19.30]Deviation from a protocol shall result in punishment.
[51:24.39]Remember what I have told you.
[51:27.77]It was a joke.
[51:28.53]I'm kidding.
[51:29.63]I appreciate every fucking sob.

[51:52.12]Now, now we got real interesting.
[51:58.12]How do you use the special dagger?
[52:00.02]You put your fingers through one side, and you knit your way into the other side, and you hold it like a fucking... You hold it like you're turning a jar, and you stab somebody with it, right in the gullet.
[52:13.58]Alright.
[52:17.72]Let's talk to this guy.
[52:21.87]You just got into a voice actor?
[52:26.07]You'll find them through that door.
[52:29.60]What the fuck are you talking about?
[52:30.48]Wait, that's the guy!
[52:31.24]That's the guy from the barbershop.
[52:52.06]They need exterminating or, to be blunt, sir, they need killing.
[52:58.89]And plenty- Uh, what's the quickest way to the second level?
[53:04.73]The second floor, sir.
[53:06.69]The entrance is hidden, but a little reflection should reveal the answer.
[53:12.69]To find the key to the second floor, reach deep within yourself.
[53:17.56]I don't know.
[53:18.48]I wish you good luck, sir.
[53:20.60]I only hope you can stomach what's ahead.
[53:24.54]I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
[53:27.24]That's what he should have said.
[53:28.16]You fucking Game of Thrones wannabe.
[53:30.56]Alright, I don't have any items.
[53:31.52]There it is.
[53:32.24]Right click, arm myself, stab myself.
[53:36.20]How do I stab myself?
[53:38.82]Use the Harvest Blade on you.
[53:43.73]Come on, take like the old Netscape logo and stab yourself in the stomach for Christ's sake.
[53:51.61]Whatever.
[53:54.68]We got some busts here.
[53:57.68]This bust is of Beethoven.
[54:00.48]This is of Thomas Jefferson.
[54:05.44]Benjamin Franklin.
[54:07.90]I would pick that one if I were you.
[54:09.89]George Washington.
[54:11.89]Barbara Bush.
[54:15.44]Oh, they had to be topical about it, like, so these are all Presidents, President, President, this, oh, George Bush was in office, so this is Barbara Bush.
[54:25.39]Can I walk up there?
[54:27.29]I can't.
[54:31.73]Busty Barbara Bush.
[54:34.71]It has to be Barbara Bush.
[54:39.82]How do I activate Barbara Bush?
[54:46.18]Excuse me?
[54:47.06]No, don't, don't, don't, he's gonna do the cutscene again.
[54:50.78]What kind of pests are we talking about here?
[54:52.16]Okay, well... Is there like a hidden s- okay, examine the light.
[55:16.10]a midget display light okay that's one way to say it apparently uh display lights how do I can I turn these on is anything on the counter so
[55:45.91]Anybody have any idea what's going on?
[55:52.32]I can't walk anywhere.
[56:06.82]What?
[56:07.28]What happened?
[56:09.12]Why am I sliding on somebody's intestinal throat right now?
[56:11.59]What?
[56:13.81]I was leaving the lodge.
[56:16.90]Do I still have the item?
[56:18.30]Good.
[56:19.88]Alright, now we're inside of somebody's stomach.
[56:22.97]This got way, way more interesting.
[56:26.25]Okay, uh... Examine the floor.
[56:30.71]The surface underfoot is oddly spongy and fluid oozes up from your shoe.
[56:34.33]This is gonna be some old god Cthulhu shit, right?
[56:37.09]It has to be.
[56:39.65]Now we're just like Osmosis Jones inside of Cthulhu.
[56:42.88]I get it.
[56:44.12]I've already seen this movie.
[56:45.00]I know how it ends.
[56:47.92]New splash.
[56:49.18]All the white blood cells take over.
[56:50.70]They fucking eat all the diseases.
[56:54.38]Bill Murray sneezes like 30 times.
[56:57.60]I can't even see bits right now.
[56:59.24]I'm sorry.
[57:00.13]I'm very, very sorry about that.
[57:01.55]We will take a pause and we will look at them in just a moment.
[57:06.05]Lining.
[57:06.61]Bile covered lining.
[57:07.61]Stab this.
[57:09.07]Equip the disk.
[57:14.69]Keep going down in the butthole.
[57:19.18]Ugh.
[57:22.36]I guess there's only one way to go, because I'm in the pool of acid.
[57:27.57]A noxious pool of acid covered by a nutrient film.
[57:34.31]Save it.
[57:34.87]I'm already down here.
[57:35.59]This is gonna be, like, bad if I don't.
[57:43.00]Acid booger.
[57:48.33]Go right.
[57:48.79]Well, we found another Fallout enemy.
[57:53.23]Examine the growth.
[57:54.07]A tumorous growth erupting from its fleshy prism.
[57:57.99]A polyp grows.
[57:58.81]Alright, we've got to kill this thing with... This is the worst weapon in the game.
[58:10.84]I don't think I'm that healthy.
[58:13.52]What a terrible weapon.
[58:15.37]You couldn't have given me a sword version of this?
[58:17.61]Why does it have to be, like, a tiny little disk?
[58:23.74]Another butthole.
[58:24.40]Guess we can keep going to the right.
[58:28.06]Mushroom.
[58:30.30]Soaking in a puddle of bile.
[58:31.64]I don't think I can pick it up.
[58:33.80]All my items are gone.
[58:36.18]Oh, goddammit.
[58:37.11]Really?
[58:47.90]I think I'm still alright.
[58:48.72]I don't think I'm dead yet.
[58:50.44]A shell lodged deep in the porous wall.
[58:52.28]Looks like a cocoon of some sort.
[58:56.14]You die in here, and then you come out, you get reborn or something, I'm gonna assume.
[59:00.58]Alright, so I had to go in the other butthole.
[59:04.94]Okay.
[59:06.64]Save.
[59:07.00]I'm... Save?
[59:08.21]I'm saving?
[59:09.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[59:09.61]I'm not saving enough?
[59:13.33]Why am I saving every... Save every two seconds.
[59:18.51]I guess.
[59:20.31]Nothing else I can do.
[59:21.03]I have to go in the other hole.
[59:24.42]So this one.
[59:29.94]Now we have an eyeball baby.
[59:30.90]I love that I saved all the combat for the last like 40 minutes of the game.
[59:40.65]And you thought the walls had ears.
[59:45.91]Okay, I'm gonna have to pop this.
[59:48.02]It's a big blue eye looking right at you.
[59:49.98]I'm gonna go over and just zip pop this with the, uh, with the harvester knife.
[59:56.12]Nothing nowhere else to go, right?
[59:57.68]I guess I could go right, yeah.
[59:59.09]There we go.
[60:01.17]Get close.
[60:03.41]Ooh, there it is!
[60:05.51]With a backhanded slice, we open up our next assignment.
[60:13.46]Alright, three doors.
[60:14.08]Alright.
[60:15.28]Door one.
[60:15.50]New guy.
[60:38.95]Is this the hotel?
[60:39.71]I'm inside of Harvest, right?
[60:43.25]Toga?
[60:46.03]Operate the Toga.
[60:47.99]The cloakroom attendant warns you not to touch anything.
[60:49.98]So just fucking murder this guy.
[60:51.64]It's that easy.
[60:55.32]No, nothing in there.
[60:56.40]Let's talk to him.
[60:57.40]This is a cloakroom, sir.
[60:59.14]By definition, not a fitting place to seek answers.
[61:02.81]However, it's plain that the acid from your ordeal is eating away at your clothing and skin.
[61:07.95]Acid.
[61:08.71]I can clean your clothes for a minor consideration of $5.
[61:11.11]I have $5.
[61:15.55]This is a cloakroom, sir.
[61:17.27]By definition, not a fitting place to seek answers.
[61:20.83]So I need clean clothes.
[61:21.89]Again, the door seems to be locked.
[61:25.50]Hangers.
[61:27.56]Chair.
[61:29.14]This guy has to go away before I can do this.
[61:33.40]Apparently.
[61:36.50]Let's examine the vase.
[61:39.44]Metal doors.
[61:40.16]We're gonna go and see... Do I get any healing potions or anything?
[61:48.69]Eventually?
[61:51.47]Or what?
[61:52.81]This is the Last Supper.
[61:56.87]There's Judas.
[61:57.53]And there's Jesus.
[62:02.91]This is how it played out.
[62:03.89]That's what I am.
[62:04.67]I'm Benedict Donald.
[62:07.54]I did this.
[62:09.68]They must have disagreed with something that ate them.
[62:12.66]What?
[62:14.54]Okay.
[62:17.52]They must have disagreed with something.
[62:18.62]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[62:22.05]We've got... Window, the mountains which barred your escape from harvest are visible through the thick glass.
[62:32.83]I don't think I can do anything here.
[62:39.00]The walls of this room contain scenes of horror and death.
[62:41.01]What about this way?
[62:43.15]Oh, here's the chef.
[62:43.79]Is the chef gonna come after me with a knife?
[62:51.99]Chef One.
[62:52.71]What, was there more than one chef?
[62:54.43]The Grand Poobah!
[63:14.54]Uh, alright.
[63:14.98]Do you know anybody named Stephanie?
[63:16.60]You feel the- you feel pain from the acid that's eating through your clothes.
[63:19.14]Nice ketchup and mustard.

[64:15.34]Anything else?
[64:17.20]Nothing else.
[64:19.70]Chef Ramsay would have a field day with this guy.
[64:24.49]That's... Oh, dear.
[64:29.75]Can you tell me anything that might help me?
[64:32.11]Okay.
[64:34.99]Any more meat on the ground?
[64:35.83]There is... Are we gonna build a person?
[64:37.85]I feel like that's the next step here.
[64:42.58]Payphone?
[64:43.02]No.
[64:46.02]I'm gonna have to reassemble my girlfriend.
[64:47.88]That's not terrifying at all.
[64:50.56]Alright, I think we're done here.
[64:51.66]Wait, can I give him the meat?
[64:52.90]Nope.
[64:56.25]Uh, you don't know anything, do you?
[64:58.65]The hands are moving, yeah.
[65:01.99]Uh-oh.
[65:18.20]Head and hand in kitchen.
[65:19.52]Wait, I... What happened?
[65:26.19]I was reading chat.
[65:26.81]What happened?
[65:27.29]What did I do?
[65:29.43]What happened?
[65:33.67]Why did I... What happened to my body?
[65:39.96]Did I strip on something?
[65:41.24]Acid.
[65:44.74]Acid.
[65:51.64]So I have to... Where the hell am I now?
[65:54.42]This is like a saloon.
[65:56.30]I'm gonna... Okay, wait, wait.
[65:57.28]I gotta figure out the acid puzzle.
[66:02.95]Because I'm gonna die.
[66:06.15]Acid puzzle.
[66:07.09]Acid, acid, acid, acid.
[66:10.59]I need an anti... I need an antacid.
[66:12.90]I need to take a Tums.

[66:18.96]Heavy metal?
[66:22.11]Heavy metal.
[66:22.81]It's the only station.
[66:23.97]They have creepy piano music and heavy metal.
[66:28.64]What a fucked up town.
[66:31.34]I need five dollars?
[66:35.18]Take the table.
[66:35.90]No, can't do that.
[66:37.58]Rug, no.
[66:46.26]I can't leave either.
[66:50.10]How do I give this guy five dollars?
[66:52.47]Should I kill him?
[66:56.77]I'm gonna die.
[66:59.93]Not if I go quick enough, it won't- it can't like register.
[67:05.07]Wait, hold on.
[67:10.58]Pawing off the furniture in the room.
[67:13.40]You need to skip the guy at the sub.
[67:17.26]Hey, I don't got five dollars, but I got a five dollar footlong.
[67:20.06]Do you want that instead?
[67:22.50]Wasn't there a fucking bellhop in the $5 footlong commercial too?
[67:25.44]I feel like that would work.
[67:28.65]Aw, man.
[67:29.79]Okay, we got... Anything else here?
[67:36.09]Can't take the hand.
[67:39.61]Counter.

[68:04.61]Who has a five dollar bill?
[68:11.25]Ooh, a cash register.
[68:12.37]The cash register is locked.
[68:14.11]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[68:19.32]Where the hell am I?
[68:20.76]Okay, there is... There is a super fucking Mario.
[68:26.76]Plant.
[68:28.04]Plant's blocking your way.
[68:29.81]And watch this.
[68:41.36]Well, I can guarantee you that don't happen in fucking Marty's Odyssey.
[68:50.44]That scream, I swear to God, that scream is in every Halloween toy.
[69:02.02]Where's the $5?
[69:08.37]These are all names, so stupid.
[69:09.89]I forget even where I am.

[70:40.54]I don't care what he has to say.
[70:44.62]We need to compare them.
[70:45.28]I think they're correct.
[70:51.98]Let's hear it.
[70:52.99]We're going to do one and the other.
[70:57.93]So, let's see here.
[70:58.59]So, here comes this one.
[71:11.26]Not the right one.
[71:12.00]Whatever.
[71:12.40]Fuck it.
[71:15.38]That's not correct.
[71:16.67]Load game.
[71:17.91]So we're not going that way.
[71:18.79]We need to find $5.
[71:23.21]Not even fucking close.
[71:27.13]The other one was way longer.
[71:28.25]I gotta save after I take all this guy's stuff.
[71:29.89]Oh well.
[71:30.99]Alright, we'll get that.
[71:41.42]Get the torso.
[71:42.80]Got the sandwich torso arm.

[71:48.49]No.
[71:49.81]So let's save it again.
[71:52.27]The next slot.

[72:07.30]Alright, money.
[72:08.44]I need money.
[72:16.90]Where the fuck am I going to get money?
[72:21.02]Examine the table and chairs.
[72:22.36]All the furniture in this bar seems to be badly taken care of.
[72:24.82]God damn it.
[72:28.53]Nobody left a $5 bill.
[72:30.27]Like a tip for the waitress.
[72:33.01]Without going over here.
[72:33.97]I'm not going to do anything.
[72:36.31]I'm not going near this.
[72:38.37]No, there's nothing here.
[72:39.29]Examine the pod.
[72:40.13]It's like an alien pod.
[72:42.71]I can play the piano.
[72:44.71]I can't play the piano.
[72:47.38]There's no money.
[72:49.00]Nothing.
[72:54.69]Wait a minute.
[73:00.07]Is this a little house?
[73:00.95]Is this a little shop of horrors thing here?
[73:04.64]Use meat on plant.
[73:05.74]What?
[73:06.36]In what world is that not correct?
[73:09.98]If he eats the sandwich, I swear to God.
[73:15.08]No little shop of horrors, guys.
[73:16.30]Sorry.
[73:33.29]I think I just have to... Where have I not explored yet?
[73:37.53]Table.
[73:39.47]I can't let go on this guy's desk.
[73:42.09]There's the rock music.
[73:43.10]There's nothing else in here.
[73:44.00]I need to get ahead.
[73:56.00]This guy, no money, hat box.
[74:01.46]Head in the pot, head in the pot.
[74:03.82]What do you mean head in the pot?
[74:20.23]Head in the pot.
[74:25.70]What are you talking about?
[74:28.66]I need to go in the... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[74:31.85]Alright, hold on.
[74:33.05]I got it.
[74:34.33]I have to drink beer.
[74:37.71]Examine... Look, this is the only one that can be touched.
[74:40.52]Extra strong beer.
[74:42.08]You take the beer and drink it, the room spins and your vision blurs momentarily.
[74:46.34]See, that's how you get five dollars.
[74:55.80]What the fuck is that?
[74:58.91]Do I have to fight?
[74:59.85]Is this a... I was going for the legs, guys.
[75:03.43]I was going for the knees.
[75:17.40]Is that a metaphor?
[75:18.34]Or is it that I actually lose?
[75:21.06]Yeah, that was Link versus Dark Link.
[75:32.23]Nice reskin.
[75:36.77]Come on, Sakurai.
[75:37.76]You can do better than that, you mother... Don't accidentally hit that, because that's dangerous.
[75:45.04]I almost just put my fucking hand straight down on this.
[75:50.04]I almost just fucking went like, you... That would have been a scream moment.
[75:56.13]Alright.
[75:57.57]Let's do it again.
[76:03.74]Time to fight the mirror, fight the shadow version.
[76:06.32]I'm gonna... Is there a crouch?
[76:08.32]I'm gonna go up.
[76:10.85]Stop going that far.
[76:11.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[76:15.93]Got him right.
[76:17.83]Searching the body, you find a small key.
[76:21.71]Head in the kitchen pot.
[76:23.01]I'm not putting my head in a kitchen pot.
[76:29.12]Put your head in the kitchen pot.
[76:31.52]Alright, guys.
[76:32.76]Let's do it.
[76:35.53]Let's go put our head in the pot.
[76:37.69]Okay, pot.
[76:41.23]A watched severed head never boils.
[76:43.19]Come on.
[76:45.31]Get it in there.
[76:47.85]Get in there, come on.
[76:50.43]I can't pick this up.
[76:54.52]I can't, there's no picking this up.
[77:00.60]There's a head in the pot.
[77:01.72]I see it, I can't touch it.
[77:04.16]Cash register.
[77:14.27]Chad is getting mad at the streamer when they told him to do this.
[77:18.67]Barkeep.
[77:19.53]What is wrong with me?
[77:22.87]Wait, can I eat the sandwich?
[77:24.67]No, I'm not eating that sandwich.
[77:25.70]What if it's... I need it.

[82:37.93]I didn't know.
[82:38.79]I thought this was like an acid toga.
[82:40.37]I thought I was going to have to put it on.
[82:41.81]That's why I didn't want to use it.
[82:42.81]Everybody calm down.
[82:45.73]I'm getting there.

[83:00.80]Alright, is there anything else to do in here?
[83:02.90]Let's just go in.
[83:05.35]There is a box of shotgun shells.
[83:08.83]Like rare gems, these shotgun shells have been secreted in this hidden room by someone who knew their value.
[83:14.97]Secreted or secreted, I'm not sure.
[83:16.75]How many shells is it?
[83:20.72]Fifteen shells!

[83:38.53]Pipe?
[83:39.70]Claw marks.
[83:41.42]Break the length of this pipe floor to ceiling.

[84:06.12]Could I have no idea?
[84:06.82]Let me just double check that I can't walk the other way.

[84:13.08]Alright, that's fine.
[84:14.62]Good to go.

[85:23.44]What is going on in the background?
[85:32.94]Okay, I can do that better.
[85:34.12]We're going to put the scythe on.
[85:35.28]I don't want to waste bullets.
[85:39.17]Why would I waste bullets for the stupid skeleton bird enemy?
[85:43.55]This thing's got good enough reach.
[85:47.40]Operate the switch.
[85:49.96]Here we go.
[86:05.61]Okay, we're gonna use... We're gonna use the shotgun.
[86:09.21]Because that guy's hard.
[86:10.69]That guy's hard.
[86:11.45]Alright, we understand now that that guy is difficult.
[86:13.69]Now we're not gonna fuck it up.

[86:29.22]But, so let's... Let's shoot this guy.
[86:32.90]Preferably in his fucking bird skull.
[86:52.30]Go back!
[86:59.97]My cursor was up like a hair and I shot the wrong way.
[87:05.65]I shot over his head.
[87:09.99]For the love of God.
[87:10.89]Alright, I can't wait to save this when this is done.
[87:22.41]Save it.
[87:26.07]Don't care about the repercussions.
[87:27.33]This guy dies now.
[87:28.43]I don't know who this was.
[87:29.37]Okay.
[87:48.59]Lost.
[87:49.45]Examine the pinball machine.

[88:07.13]Pool stick.
[88:07.71]You can take the pool stick.
[88:12.53]Slot machines.
[88:14.19]Radio.
[88:15.38]Maybe you can get some out of town stations.
[88:18.43]You probably have to turn all the... Yeah, all the radio stations have to be the rock music to progress.
[88:24.57]I'm going to have to sue.
[88:26.29]Gumball machine.
[88:28.63]Free gumball.
[88:30.05]You eat the gumball and feel better.
[88:31.45]Let's eat a bunch of them.
[88:36.05]How do I know I'm at max health?
[88:40.82]This should be pretty close at this point.
[88:42.04]Let's see.
[88:43.94]Yeah, I feel fine.
[88:46.99]Slot machine.
[88:47.77]Some classic one-armed bandits.
[88:52.57]Well, whoever you are, you have an interesting setup here.
[88:57.85]Dart board.
[88:58.42]Looks like Tom is ahead.
[89:01.32]Tom is ahead.
[89:01.94]Okay, there's nothing else.
[89:02.88]Baseball bat.
[89:03.70]Batter up.
[89:04.32]I can take it.
[89:05.26]Don't really need it for anything.
[89:06.52]Foosball table.
[89:09.04]Both teams are the same color.
[89:10.52]Okay.
[89:12.05]Anything else?
[89:14.31]Save it.
[89:26.60]Slots.
[89:29.58]Got my shotgun out.
[89:30.76]I'm ready to go to the next room.
[89:32.04]Let's sneak our way over here.
[89:36.38]Examine the bubbles.
[89:37.55]Bubbles rising from below the murky surface.
[89:40.89]Okay, gross.
[89:44.37]This is some cult shit like we already knew.
[89:47.75]Don't think there's anything else for me to do.
[89:49.09]Oh, of course there is.
[89:52.04]Of course a slime zombie is gonna come get me.
[90:02.30]It didn't know animation?
[90:03.54]No, nothing.
[90:09.78]It just zoomed in on his mouth.
[90:12.06]They didn't want to show his head being ripped out off his shoulders, so we can't go that way.
[90:17.82]Yeah, that sucks.
[90:18.50]Um... Hmm.
[90:26.72]That's where you use the meat.
[90:28.04]It goes through a cutscene, I can't.
[90:29.94]Why am I supposed to do that?
[90:31.45]I need to go eat the candy again though.
[90:45.76]I know, I know, I already did.
[90:48.30]Use the meat, use the meat.
[90:50.90]Use the side.
[90:51.52]Wait, what do you mean use the meat?
[90:54.50]Examine the bubbles.
[90:55.78]Use the- use the bubbles.
[90:57.96]Throw meat at the bubbles.
[91:00.43]Is this gonna work?
[91:02.15]Alright, well, this is- Alright, well, we cheated.
[91:04.37]Alright, so we win.
[91:09.09]What's it gonna do?
[91:09.71]Examine the bubbles.
[91:10.29]Are bubbles rising from below the murky surface?
[91:12.75]I don't think I can do it.
[91:18.62]Okay.
[91:20.86]It actually- Nice job, chat!
[91:24.30]Mmm, sink.
[91:25.84]Someone must have mistaken this for a toilet.
[91:27.66]Somebody shit in the sink.
[91:29.24]I've been there before, it's not pretty.
[91:31.90]Not that I didn't do it.
[91:35.52]I didn't, no, and that was, I made that up.
[91:37.68]Like, I didn't, I never, like, I've never shit in a sink and I've never seen anybody else shit in a sink.
[91:41.65]I've never gone into a public restroom and, like, washed my hands and somebody shit in a sink.
[91:46.49]I was just saying it because I was trying to continue the narrative.
[91:48.97]I'm gonna knock things over.
[91:49.91]Uh, examine the trash.
[91:54.29]The roaches are crazed by the succulent riches contained.
[91:58.47]Cans, they're empty.
[92:02.15]Examine the toilets.
[92:03.97]Olive-toned slime runs down these bowls, obviously the product of a vegetarian with the runs.
[92:11.66]Okay, here comes a toilet flush puzzle.
[92:16.16]Vegetarian with the runs.
[92:19.30]Out of order.
[92:21.82]A lot of vegetarians here.
[92:25.66]Bathtub.
[92:29.68]Weed killer?
[92:31.24]Alright, that's how you kill the plant, for sure.
[92:34.41]Empty lockers.
[92:35.85]Empty lockers.
[92:38.73]Nothing else?
[92:41.01]Well, now we can go the other way.
[92:43.11]So that's good.
[92:44.83]I've been there before.
[92:49.69]What about this?
[92:50.09]Is this a manhole?
[92:50.94]No.
[92:52.54]Roller?
[92:53.88]In lieu of toilet paper, please avail yourself of the lodger's own bidet.
[92:58.16]The fluid leaking from out of the order toilet.
[93:00.66]A little patience and a good aim.
[93:02.96]That's gross.
[93:04.48]Fucking bidet.
[93:07.16]Honestly, in... In what world...
[93:11.11]does sitting because look when I sit on the toilet and I go to the bathroom I don't imagine that water shooting up into my asshole is going to clean me I'm gonna want to get in the shower after that it's gonna run down your legs how does that make any sense I'm thinking of like a garden hose that has like the big spray jet setting and you sit over it and it just that's gonna make a fucking mess and you're gonna have to re-clean yourself
[93:43.05]Why would you want to use that?
[93:47.77]You relieve yourself and then you press the button and you send a... as if you knocked a hydrant off the street.
[93:56.01]Just use toilet paper.
[94:01.69]You're trying to eat.
[94:02.77]Somebody just said, I'm trying to eat.
[94:05.83]During this game?
[94:08.81]After just talking about the vegan diarrhea?
[94:13.16]You think I'm the problem?
[94:14.72]You think I'm the issue here?
[94:17.96]Holy shit, man.
[94:19.38]I'm trying to eat.
[94:20.80]Tell me more about that vegan shit that's in the toilet.
[94:23.93]Like diarrhea and blood and piss and baby's eyes coming out of their skulls.
[94:30.77]Nothing else can happen here.
[94:37.26]It's dinner time in PST, but what are you doing here?
[94:42.62]You should be watching, like, you should be watching a fucking... Cartoon.
[94:48.02]Is this gonna kill me again?
[94:48.84]I think I have to do it again.
[94:59.72]I don't, I might not have to do it again.
[95:04.54]No, I probably do.
[95:05.54]Let's just, just... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I need to, I didn't want to waste the other piece of meat, but we need to.
[95:12.10]Always go back to cartoons.
[95:13.60]I am a cartoon.
[95:14.62]Well, I could see that.
[95:24.10]Well, I knew it was going to happen.
[95:25.64]Alright, there's the last piece of meat here.
[95:27.10]Bubbles.
[95:30.22]Enjoy yourself.
[95:32.63]Fucking blood-borne enemy.
[95:33.83]Alright, rock music's playing here.
[95:37.24]Keep going to the right and save.
[95:39.20]No, we don't even need to.
[95:41.17]There's no point.
[95:43.45]Where's the other radio?
[95:44.85]Okay, there's a chef.
[95:54.09]I gotta go weed killer, right?
[95:58.18]Weed killer.
[95:58.82]On you.
[96:03.94]On plant.
[96:04.92]On plant.
[96:07.54]Dead.
[96:08.26]Okay.
[96:09.28]Is it actually dead or does it wake back up after a certain amount of time?
[96:12.72]Examine the gate.
[96:14.02]A closed gate.
[96:15.16]Open it, please.
[96:17.08]Examine the fountain.
[96:18.02]A cool, refreshing fountain.
[96:19.48]Operate the fountain.
[96:36.88]We need to see them.
[96:49.04]Alright, yeah, that's good.
[96:52.81]That's a good thumbnail.
[96:54.55]Hold on.
[96:56.45]I gotta get out of the way for this thumbnail.
[97:02.51]No, wrong thing.
[97:03.29]Here we go.
[97:04.33]There's your thumbnail.
[97:09.83]That's a Goosebumps book.
[97:13.11]Alright.
[97:13.35]Let's get this back to normal.
[97:17.19]Oh, whoops-a-daisy.
[97:27.33]Why isn't it moving my other... Lock this, please.
[97:33.69]I can't get it off the screen.
[97:35.44]Oh, God, hold on.
[97:37.62]I'll reset the transformation.
[97:45.79]All that just to see this.
[97:48.95]OK, that's in the right spot.
[97:50.47]Looks good, right?
[97:53.48]Good enough.
[97:55.74]Alright.
[98:03.14]What am I doing?
[98:11.78]Okay.
[98:12.44]Sorry.
[98:14.28]Sorry!
[98:15.49]Alright, what do I do here?
[98:17.17]Two tiki torches?
[98:21.05]This was meaningless.
[98:24.78]They at least could have made that move around.
[98:26.24]That can't be meaningless.
[98:44.65]Is there something in here?
[98:49.91]In the water, but what's... where?
[98:54.79]I'm just distracted by this home improvement face.
[98:58.37]Wait.
[98:59.72]I just saw text.
[99:01.62]Wait.
[99:03.12]Fountain Key.
[99:03.94]Okay.
[99:08.84]I never would have found that.
[99:09.80]Holy shit.
[99:12.74]Okay, anything else?
[99:18.73]Alien pod?
[99:19.43]Fountain key?
[99:24.33]Is there like a secret door over here?
[99:30.29]Fountain key.
[99:32.45]Well, that didn't work.
[99:34.23]Okay.
[99:35.47]Well, that didn't work.
[99:44.76]I don't... There's nothing else here for me to do.
[99:49.24]Once a beautiful fountain needs a gardener, the weeds have taken over.
[99:54.48]Nothing else.
[99:56.59]Can't move here.
[99:57.93]What about the pod?
[99:58.87]No.
[100:00.43]Unlock the alien pod with the fountain key.
[100:03.87]That didn't work.
[100:04.85]Probably for another room.
[100:11.55]On the wall?
[100:12.31]What do you mean, on the wall?
[100:22.96]I would have never fucking seen that shit.
[100:26.08]How?
[100:26.82]How?
[100:27.18]Okay.
[100:28.88]This game is going through an ingest server into Twitch.
[100:34.97]Being pulled down to like four, just over 4,000 kilobytes, right?
[100:40.25]I stream at like 4,200, 4,300 kilobytes.
[100:41.97]So you guys are getting a degraded version of this, and you saw that before I did.
[100:52.46]Jeez, I gotta get my fucking glasses checked.
[100:59.63]Don't ask me why these are here.
[101:00.63]I don't wear these.
[101:04.01]I really don't.
[101:04.73]Okay, we're gonna save.
[101:12.05]It's like people have seen this before.
[101:13.70]I guess that's true.
[101:14.68]But really, though, this is an old game.
[101:16.58]I guess people have played it on stream before.
[101:18.10]Alright, got my gunner optics on.
[101:21.89]So, let's go.
[101:26.65]Sneaking in this door.
[101:30.93]Alright, going against Diablo 1 Diablo.
[101:42.38]I got him.
[101:43.04]I just killed the demon.
[101:45.82]A rotting piece of plywood.
[101:48.78]Power box.
[101:59.38]Good thing I had these on!
[102:03.34]The world is saved!
[102:07.48]Examine the barrel?
[102:11.24]Well, uh, we're getting U1 music.
[102:15.21]How awful do I look at these?
[102:19.73]I look like a- I look like a video game- I look like a young video game scientist.
[102:27.07]I'm gonna get an NPC in a Deus Ex game You have to the one that dies in ten seconds The guy in the beginning of the game that's like handing you papers and shit That gets like hit by a stray bullet from the here they come the bad guys broke through.
[102:42.95]That's me.
[102:43.43]I'm that guy Alright Examine the rope looks sturdy enough to climb.
[102:51.25]Okay, I can climb this rope Now the world feels weird without these
[102:59.55]Shit, now I have to wear them.
[103:01.03]I fucking hate these.
[103:02.21]Why am I wearing these?
[103:02.95]I don't want to wear these.
[103:03.82]Save.
[103:05.24]You won, Harvester.
[103:07.46]We gotta go up to the top here.
[103:17.06]I got my shotgun just in case there's any more extra enemies.
[103:19.94]Nothing else here.
[103:22.71]Operate the rope.
[103:26.91]Blast ending cutscene!
[103:29.23]Bad guy!
[103:45.87]Did you notice what that guy looked like?
[104:24.64]Welcome to the Harvest Moon Art Gallery, sir.
[104:28.06]I'm the curator of this place.
[104:30.42]So delighted you could come.
[104:38.08]This is me.
[104:40.22]I expect it'll be an engaging experience.
[104:42.30]Can't wait to see what passes for art in this hellhole.
[104:44.48]That's always the dilemma, sir.
[104:46.78]What are the boundaries of art?
[104:48.85]Only you can answer that, and only for yourself.
[104:52.89]Lovely works, pastoral scenes, noble sculptures.
[104:56.75]These are easy on the eye and mind.
[104:59.09]But when confronted with a work of hideous form, you're forced to deal with it, even if only to dismiss it as trash.
[105:07.94]Sadly, the most extreme works are the hardest to dismiss.
[105:14.01]I kind of want to shoot him again.
[105:15.83]I kind of want to shoot this guy.
[105:16.94]So there are like 3,000 people here right now.
[105:18.80]Can you imagine coming to a stream and seeing a guy play a point and click adventure game with fucking gunner optics on?
[105:43.64]I can see every pixel.
[105:45.74]It's so much better.
[105:46.78]It's so much easier to play.
[105:48.34]They probably think I'm such a fucking tool.
[105:51.38]How many of you guys just walked in the stream like five seconds ago?
[105:54.32]And how annoyed are you that I'm wearing these?
[106:00.00]Oh yeah, you gotta have your gunner optics on to calibrate the screen refresh rate for Harvester.
[106:08.11]Dickie.
[106:15.01]Your real fans know you're a tool.
[106:18.38]Oh, yeah?
[106:20.76]I don't want to hear him do that shit again.
[106:26.00]Hey, didn't even need to look.
[106:36.81]Oh, fuck.
[106:40.39]What's this one?
[106:41.39]Gunner Optics, activate!
[106:47.13]Got him!
[106:49.71]Didn't even need to fucking look!
[106:54.32]I just coughed up like blood.
[107:03.30]Laser sights.
[107:05.16]Oh yeah?
[107:13.41]Alright, let's see what the difference is.
[107:19.36]I'm having trouble shooting this guy.
[107:21.22]I don't understand.
[107:22.38]What's the problem here?
[107:28.44]Redo.
[107:29.18]Redo.
[107:29.48]This is for the video.
[107:31.08]This is for the video.
[107:32.24]Nothing else.
[107:33.60]You have to watch.
[107:34.20]He's going to cut from there the last thing we just did.
[107:40.75]Just bear with me here.
[107:43.76]I just, I don't understand what the problem is.
[107:45.68]There's some issue that I'm not understanding.
[107:48.08]I just, I can't figure it out what the problem is.
[107:50.38]God, fuck you.
[107:51.66]I tried to aim... I look good, too.
[108:06.20]You know, I just don't understand what the issue is.
[108:09.68]I feel like I'm lined up correctly in the right coordinates.
[108:12.10]I feel like there must be something missing.
[108:14.22]I'm not sure what that is.
[108:15.89]It could be... Gunner Optics!
[108:18.81]Download them today!
[108:22.37]One more take.
[108:22.83]Look at my hair.
[108:26.29]Last take.
[108:26.79]This is the last take.
[108:31.74]Last take.
[108:41.95]I mean, I'm having an issue.
[108:44.53]I'm not sure what the problem is.
[108:47.57]It's something about the fact that maybe... Wowee!
[108:50.57]Wowee zowie!
[108:53.51]Gunner optics!
[108:54.49]Just shove them up your ass!
[108:59.58]Alright, let's play.
[109:00.12]We can move on now.
[109:10.48]I'm so used to shooting right now, I was just gonna shoot him.
[109:12.70]What was this?
[109:13.92]What was- that was going like this?
[109:15.00]Alright, talk to him, skip all his cutscene dialog, who cares, can't wait to see fuckin' Hellhound.
[109:19.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, lovely work you got here.
[109:22.55]Anything else?
[109:23.35]Uh, expect an enlightening experience.
[109:37.73]I'm just passing through.
[109:39.91]Okay, save it here.
[109:43.63]Save the game.
[109:44.31]Let me call this one just passing through.
[109:50.10]Just passing is fine.
[109:55.72]Let's keep going.
[110:01.75]Oh boy, that's not good.
[110:03.57]That's not good.
[110:05.49]I just...
[110:19.66]Oh, fuck me.
[110:27.10]I'm so sorry.
[110:33.57]I have my- I have- I'm gonna have to make sure that's alright after the stream.
[110:45.68]How loud was that?
[110:46.54]I need to formally apologize.
[110:50.28]Because that was, like, I did not expect that to happen.
[110:53.32]I was trying to put these on and shoot.
[110:56.74]And then I just knocked into this thing over here.
[110:59.56]Was that fucking terrible?
[111:01.64]Please forgive me.
[111:02.96]Please fucking forgive me.
[111:04.01]I'm so sorry.
[111:10.89]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[111:11.85]Please forgive me.
[111:13.83]Okay, let's go.
[111:16.08]Could have been way louder.
[111:16.96]Alright.
[111:17.65]Well, um... I'm glad that it wasn't that bad.
[111:25.11]Where am I?
[111:25.41]There's a passenger.
[111:30.89]Did I, like, fuck up the mic?
[111:32.59]I may have.
[111:34.73]Alright.
[111:35.29]Let's go.
[111:39.27]I can't get by him.
[111:44.62]Okay.
[111:46.15]Art gallery.
[111:48.77]Muted.
[111:49.33]What?
[111:49.67]No.
[111:51.45]Why is he wearing these glasses?
[111:52.71]I fucking told you people were gonna come.
[111:54.96]Examine the soul stone.
[111:56.74]Sickeningly offensive.
[111:59.58]Why?
[111:59.76]What's wrong with it?
[112:03.06]Doesn't look like anything offensive.
[112:06.44]It's not like... Alright.
[112:12.96]Pick up the key.
[112:13.66]Small statue.
[112:18.93]It's a painting of a guy's forehead.
[112:23.18]That's a hairline with a forehead.
[112:25.44]Why would you paint that?
[112:29.62]Strangely calming.
[112:30.62]This ball's gonna run out and try to get me.
[112:39.58]Roughly hewn in jade.
[112:41.02]Okay, there are buttons to press on these things.
[112:44.90]I feel like I need to remember this stuff.
[112:47.73]He's going to run out and hit me.
[112:49.53]They don't put a camera angle like that here.
[112:56.33]Unless he's going to do something weird.
[112:57.83]There's grease on these now, somehow.
[113:09.92]Examine the door.
[113:10.84]Photograph strange group of guys.
[113:16.11]Door's locked.
[113:16.91]I do have a key now.
[113:17.69]I want to see what's on the... I'm going to save.
[113:22.65]Because I'm running out of bullets.
[113:28.97]Ammo issues.
[113:29.87]Let's keep going.
[113:30.73]One more.
[113:33.99]Heavy and intimidating.
[113:35.23]I need to recover this.
[113:36.29]And I'm not.
[113:36.85]I've got to write these down.
[113:38.01]Hmm.
[113:45.37]This is the dumbest enemy in the whole game and I'm about to lose to it.
[113:51.34]What's my health like?
[113:53.16]No, I'm sorry.
[113:54.24]I'm not letting that happen.
[113:57.68]I'm getting beat by like a training bicycle.
[114:00.14]Not gonna happen.
[114:00.62]I'm gonna save that last bullet for when it matters.
[114:09.31]Baseball bat, pool cue, side.
[114:12.47]This is the one you have to use.
[114:14.63]We are playing Harvester.
[114:23.00]Defense.
[114:23.42]The best defense is a good offense.
[114:25.90]Switch that around.
[114:26.48]That's what I meant to say.
[114:28.70]And some... People are giving money.
[114:31.72]Oh my god.
[114:32.36]Okay.
[114:32.74]I'm going to have to take a moment here.
[114:35.22]After we beat Harvester, I'm going to take a moment to catch up with the bits.
[114:39.82]Because, like, people are giving a lot of money.
[114:42.29]And, like, my brain and, like, the way... Alright, we're behind this guy now.
[114:47.03]No, let's do it now.
[114:52.83]Let's do it now.
[114:53.57]Let's do it now.
[114:59.30]Save it here.
[115:02.88]Healthcare application.
[115:14.26]Why would I name it that?
[115:17.80]Remind me to load this.
[115:20.24]Alright.
[115:27.46]Remind me.
[115:32.65]Hold on.
[115:36.11]Alright, first of all, let's move this in the right spot.
[115:42.64]Edgemont, thank you for the $50.
[115:43.90]The 5,000 bits, appreciate it.
[115:48.22]They say, moderately okay gunner optic joke.
[115:52.25]Moderately okay.
[115:52.95]I'll go with moderately okay.
[115:54.55]That's good with me.
[115:55.17]This is like fogged up.
[115:58.69]But thank you so much, Edgemont, for the $50.
[116:00.29]Appreciate it, man.
[116:01.91]That's a lot of money.
[116:03.89]And you also say L-U-L.
[116:06.43]You also say L-U-L.
[116:09.09]That actually means you thought it was funny.
[116:12.22]Thank you, appreciate it.
[116:15.12]You're... You are a great, wonderful contributor to this livestream.
[116:24.28]Thank you.
[116:25.14]WC Cube with $40, 4,000 bits.
[116:28.66]Right now, actually.
[116:29.56]You're gonna see it right now.
[116:30.46]There it is.
[116:32.14]Thank you, WC Cube, for your $40.
[116:35.50]I've been cleaning the same side for like fucking full two minutes.
[116:42.64]Uh, WC Cube, thanks.
[116:43.60]Again, I've been a fan for years, but I don't use Twitch.
[116:46.58]Wanted to pop in just once and give you some money and let you know how important you are.
[116:49.96]Love you, man.
[116:50.64]Well, Jesus, thank you.
[116:53.78]And you're like, yeah, I'm just popping in.
[116:55.42]Yeah, like, I watch you on YouTube, but, uh, it's like 40 bucks.
[116:59.12]Like, damn.
[117:01.54]That's... Knowing that, that's fucking... Thanks, man.
[117:08.12]Not necessary, but... I'm glad you, uh...
[117:11.58]Glad you did it regardless, I guess, because it's... It's $40, and that's a very, very, very kind message.
[117:18.56]So, thank you.
[117:21.88]Corvid Boon, thanks for the $1.
[117:23.22]A dollar for my favorite Vinesauce streamer.
[117:28.95]What the fuck did you just say?
[117:32.25]You don't bring up his name in my stream.
[117:35.57]You saw what he did that time.
[117:36.65]He came in here and he was like... He came in here and he was like...
[117:41.56]Watch how fast I can do this.
[117:47.79]That's me doing it.
[117:51.47]Can't do that.
[117:52.03]Fucking give me an award.
[117:54.45]Uh, anyways.
[117:56.89]Uh, thank you, Corbin, for the one dollar.
[117:58.61]And it's harder to read.
[118:01.63]Uh, Freck, Freckster.
[118:04.49]Freckster, thanks for the ten bucks.
[118:06.87]Thanks for giving me something to look forward to, even if it means I have to stay up until 7 a.m.
[118:10.79]usually.
[118:12.08]But to be honest, that works well with my insomnia.
[118:14.82]Love you, Jeremy.
[118:15.42]Well, Frexton, thanks for the 10 bucks, first of all.
[118:18.12]And second of all, I also have insomnia.
[118:21.46]So I know what that's like.
[118:24.32]I know what it's like to stay up until like 6, 7, 8 o'clock in the morning every day.
[118:29.52]I've tried to correct it over and over again.
[118:33.10]I keep just falling back into it, though.
[118:36.04]It's really annoying, actually.
[118:38.84]You get, like, stuck.
[118:40.56]And you just can't... Being asleep during the day just, like, paralyzes you.
[118:45.06]Unfortunately, but... Thank you so much.
[118:48.00]I appreciate it, man.
[118:51.20]Good luck with your insomnia.
[118:53.07]Hopefully, you get it worked out eventually.
[118:56.83]Also, CarCar, thanks for the $5.
[119:00.01]Can you be unbanned from the Discord?
[119:01.91]I don't know.
[119:02.21]That depends.
[119:02.75]Why did you get banned from the Discord?
[119:04.19]Did you do something bad?
[119:07.15]You can't take that up with me.
[119:09.13]I do not own that Discord.
[119:13.55]I officially endorse it.
[119:15.07]But I don't own it.
[119:15.97]So you're going to have to take it up with the people that may have... If you did something wrong.
[119:19.91]You may have done something wrong.
[119:20.77]Don't do anything wrong.
[119:22.45]Be a good boy.
[119:24.20]But thank you, Karkar, for the $5.
[119:25.66]Take it up with the mods or the Discord.
[119:29.68]The Discorders.
[119:31.56]Thank you.
[119:32.84]Hopefully you get that figured out.
[119:35.62]Uh...
[119:36.94]Bandicoot?
[119:37.50]Thank you, Guy.
[119:38.40]How do you say your name?
[119:39.42]Is it Guy Gas?
[119:40.76]Guy Gas Bandicoot?
[119:42.77]Thanks for the $5, man.
[119:44.87]Hey, Jerma, just thought you'd like to know that me and my friend think you're hot, but my third friend thinks you have a tiny head.
[119:54.05]Oh, is your third friend watching right now?
[119:58.33]Tell him to watch.
[120:00.63]I'll give you a minute.
[120:03.49]I'll give you a minute.
[120:11.60]Small head, huh?
[120:18.85]You know what?
[120:19.43]Small heads have fucking big brains.
[120:20.89]Do you know that?
[120:22.69]The smaller your head... Look it up statistically, medically.
[120:25.73]The smaller your head, the bigger your brain.
[120:29.39]All you guys with these big heads.
[120:30.76]You just have thick skulls.
[120:32.16]You don't actually have large brains.
[120:38.30]Thank you, though.
[120:40.16]Ivory, thanks for the... where are we?
[120:42.03]We're here.
[120:45.93]Alright, we're gonna... we're gonna stop here.
[120:49.17]And by the end of the stream, we're gonna go back to the beginning, because we're taking a little bit too much time here.
[120:55.98]I am actually surprised and shocked that there's this much money coming into the stream tonight.
[121:01.52]So, we'll go back.
[121:02.68]We'll get the other ones a little bit later.
[121:05.01]But I want to finish Harvester.
[121:08.09]Thank you so much for the support, guys.
[121:10.43]Like, there's a lot of money tonight.
[121:12.11]There's a lot of individual donations tonight in the last, like, hour.
[121:17.27]Like, $2, $5, $1, $1.
[121:17.61]You guys are fucking spoiling the shit out of me like you do all the time.
[121:23.81]So, we'll get them in a minute.
[121:25.87]And by a minute, I mean probably like a couple hours.
[121:29.37]Okay, let's go.
[121:32.13]I just wanted to try to catch up a little bit.
[121:37.15]I gotta be more on top of that, man.
[121:39.97]What am I?
[121:40.33]Load?
[121:40.67]Load?
[121:40.87]Oh, okay.
[121:41.37]Load save.
[121:41.84]Yep.
[121:44.36]Load save.
[121:45.14]Which one was it?
[121:48.80]Bit read break.
[121:49.60]That's what it was.
[121:50.18]Got it.
[121:53.14]My brain is very big.
[121:55.28]Alright, so I got the key now.
[121:56.28]Let's just go open the door.
[122:02.39]And the Discord just did get posted.
[122:05.69]So if you are curious, if you want to join the Discord, it's a public Discord.
[122:11.00]There is a sub only section, but the whole thing is public.
[122:14.08]So you don't have to be a sub to use it.
[122:16.76]There are channels you can use.
[122:18.28]So we're going to go in here.
[122:20.22]Art Gallery door.
[122:27.28]Uh-huh.
[122:27.48]There's a door behind us.
[122:29.62]It needs to go down here.
[122:34.32]I guess we're going to go this way?
[122:38.28]Wait, what?
[122:42.29]Alright, is everybody else confused here?
[122:47.85]Oh God, that's like a grandmother.
[122:49.41]Can I help you?
[122:51.04]I'm looking for a girl.
[122:52.56]This is a library, not a brothel.
[122:55.54]You don't understand.
[122:56.44]I have reason.
[122:58.48]I hope to believe that she was brought here.
[123:00.06]The Discord is pretty cool.
[123:01.60]Do you know anything about that?
[123:04.06]I'm afraid not.
[123:05.63]I tend to stay out of lodge affairs.
[123:08.21]I'm only in charge of the library, my good fellow.
[123:12.31]Well, if she is here, she's not been invited as a member.
[123:17.09]There are no female members of the Order.
[123:19.00]Wait, what happened?
[123:19.62]I wasn't really laughing.
[123:20.18]To be sure, one or two have qualified throughout our history.
[123:23.84]But they're generally not of our caliber.
[123:25.78]I wasn't really laughing.
[123:26.82]I doubt there are any females in this building.
[123:29.14]I'm seeing a lot of laughs in here.
[123:30.02]At least none that are extant.
[123:37.09]What do you mean, extant?
[123:38.27]Oh, I see.
[123:39.13]You're the new initiate.
[123:41.10]If she is here, you'll find her on the third floor, which you'll have difficulty finding without my help.
[123:47.38]I need this lady's help.
[123:48.46]And you want something in return.
[123:51.04]Why is everybody laughing so hard?
[123:52.62]I'll give you a clue as to how to get to the third floor, but only if you'll retrieve an overdue book from one of our charter members, a Mr. Payne.
[124:02.59]Since he is so highly regarded among the Order, I'm loath to approach him on such an embarrassing matter.
[124:09.71]Therefore, bring me the book and I'll help you.
[124:13.07]How will I know which book?
[124:14.98]Oh, you'll know it.
[124:16.08]He's not an avid reader.
[124:17.48]Okay, got that written down.
[124:20.50]Okay.
[124:27.37]Uh... Can I... I'm look... No, we already did... We just did all this shit.
[124:30.83]Get out of here.
[124:32.97]You're a woman.
[124:33.85]I'm not a member.
[124:35.13]Women are kept here for the services they are able to render.
[124:38.38]Render?
[124:39.32]Six core.
[124:39.78]And floor.
[124:40.32]Give me the book.
[124:41.80]Give me a book.
[124:42.38]Mr. Kane has the book.
[124:43.78]Examine the book.
[124:45.16]There he is.
[124:45.62]Mr. Kane was just an object of her imagination.
[124:48.41]That's what that was.
[124:49.21]Uh... Yeah.
[125:03.17]Whatever.
[125:03.63]I don't know.
[125:05.11]I'm going to have to find Mr. Kane.
[125:08.52]Mr. Kane.
[125:12.72]Can I just walk up here?
[125:14.76]I can't.
[125:17.30]Another door.
[125:21.61]Alright, is Mr. Kane the high school teacher that during Halloween wears a terrible costume and he's like a magician or something, right?
[125:32.82]Like, Mr. Kane, this is the math book.
[125:36.74]He very clearly is doing very extreme, low-effort Halloween.
[125:41.12]But you love him anyways.
[125:41.90]He's a wicked nice guy.
[125:42.86]He's super funny.
[125:43.80]He's super entertaining.
[125:45.16]He makes a lot of jokes and everybody respects him.
[125:50.23]I think that's what this is.
[125:51.49]Let me see.
[125:53.01]Oh, yes.
[125:53.83]The new initiate.
[125:55.42]I'm the Lodge membership director.
[125:57.02]What can I do for you?
[125:58.38]Is his name Mr. Kane?
[126:02.52]The Lodge is a traditional place, young man, and by tradition, when a young man is courting a young woman, he wins for her a Kewpie doll at the fair.
[126:11.16]There is no fair within the lodge.
[126:13.50]However, I have seen a thing which resembles a Kewpie somewhere on this floor.
[126:17.17]Damn it.
[126:17.35]I need to move this.
[126:18.17]Seek it out.
[126:19.41]Slay it.
[126:19.91]What is... And return here with a prize if you would seek... Kewpie doll at the fair.
[126:26.13]Kewpie.
[126:28.71]Doll.
[126:29.11]Say it again.
[126:33.06]Let me see...
[126:34.56]Look at that girl.
[126:35.60]The lodge is a traditional place young man, and by tradition when a young man is courting a young woman, he wins for her a cupid doll at the fair.
[126:43.84]There is no fair within the lodge, however I have seen a thing which resembles a cupid somewhere on this floor.
[126:49.18]Slay the cupid.
[126:50.08]Alright, I need a cupid.
[126:55.60]What is that?
[126:56.28]Is that like a fucking Hatchimal for this year's Halloween?
[126:58.53]For this year's Christmas?
[127:00.27]Is that a fingerling?
[127:01.25]You know those monkey fingerlings?
[127:05.24]Hot item this year.
[127:06.18]Good luck finding one.
[127:08.16]They are not anywhere.
[127:10.00]Examine the swords.
[127:14.30]Photograph.
[127:15.27]Mm-hmm.
[127:18.43]Okay, well, let's just go out here.
[127:20.53]Find Mr. Kane.
[127:21.29]Did find a cupid.
[127:24.85]Piano.
[127:25.53]Beautiful grand piano.
[127:29.64]Dolphins and shit.
[127:34.97]Statue... What the hell is even here?
[127:40.73]I got $200 still.
[127:42.00]Shotgun shells?
[127:44.04]Damn it.
[127:45.74]Well, that didn't work.
[127:46.74]How can you not use shotgun shells on a shotgun?
[127:52.94]Thank you for the reminder.
[127:54.00]The save reminder.
[127:54.88]Appreciate it.
[127:58.74]Why am I doing this?
[128:01.04]I'll start here Monday, dude!
[128:04.51]Is that funny?
[128:04.99]I like looked up, I looked up this game and how long it was and I really thought there was only like 40 minutes left, so that's why we didn't have a stream yesterday.
[128:12.30]Because I didn't want to do like a 30 minute stream.
[128:14.66]Turns out, there actually was like fucking like four and a half hours left in this game, like potentially.
[128:20.54]Uh, so... You messed up.
[128:23.80]Piano.
[128:23.92]Is that Mr. Kane?
[128:37.46]Is that the book that she wants?
[128:39.18]That's the book she wants.
[128:40.26]He's holding the book.
[128:42.64]He's holding the book.
[128:50.01]Give me the book.
[128:55.57]That's not the right guy.
[128:57.69]He's holding a giant book.
[129:00.72]God damn it.
[129:03.14]I can't.
[129:03.68]That's not the right guy.
[129:08.89]That didn't do anything for me.
[129:11.05]I just made the game uncompletable.
[129:17.63]Just kill everyone?
[129:18.66]I can't!
[129:21.14]We've killed plenty of people in this playthrough so far, though.
[129:27.08]Was Mr. Kane downstairs?
[129:34.93]You know what I'm saying?
[129:35.55]I feel like Mr. Kane... There was that office that was downstairs, right?
[129:40.53]Where was this?
[129:41.71]I don't even remember... The door's locked.
[129:45.05]Far from the other side.
[129:45.97]Well, I guess we're going the right way.
[129:48.92]This is just... Wonderful.
[129:53.92]Mr. Kane?
[129:56.10]Mr. Kane!
[130:00.37]Not Mr. Kane.
[130:01.93]In fact...
[130:04.90]I don't think there's anything here.
[130:12.00]Excuse me.
[130:12.91]You can't come in right now.
[130:14.05]I just mopped the floor.
[130:15.29]Mr. Kane.
[130:19.27]Hey, buddy.
[130:19.73]Give me a break, will you?
[130:20.95]Keep up the floor.
[130:26.40]He just had dialog that I missed.
[130:28.32]Alright, buddy.
[130:29.96]You asked for it.
[130:37.52]He's staple gun.
[130:47.76]Get the fuck over here.
[130:49.84]Come on, man.
[131:06.84]I couldn't get close enough to swing at him.
[131:08.56]God damn it.
[131:11.73]Alright, well, I think... Keep off the floor, keep off the floor.
[131:15.49]There must be something else I do.
[131:16.87]I must have to get, like, squeegee shoes.
[131:22.49]Down, right, down.
[131:28.72]Hey, keep off the floor, man.
[131:30.92]You need squeegee shoes.
[131:33.18]What does he say?
[131:38.93]Excuse me, you can't come- Excuse me, what did he say?
[131:42.73]You think just because I'm a janitor I got no pride?
[131:46.81]That's all I got to do all day is clean up after you rich bastards?
[131:50.13]Big eyes before you get hurt!
[131:57.31]One shot, one kill.
[131:59.71]God damn it.
[132:07.73]Get out of here.
[132:11.58]Come on!
[132:12.20]Why would this have this much knockback?
[132:25.63]I can't even really play the game.
[132:27.32]I can't leave it.
[132:29.26]It's fucking old grandpa with a nail gun.
[132:31.80]Give me a fucking break.
[132:39.07]We're not going to do that again, so I can't go in this room.
[132:42.06]What the fuck was that?
[132:43.00]Hold on, I want to make sure nothing like this has exploded over here.
[132:50.40]Let's get the shit out of me.
[132:52.36]I think there's like an animal over here.
[132:54.22]Alright, one sec.
[132:56.71]Okay.
[133:12.64]Yeah.
[133:41.56]I'm not crazy, right?
[133:42.34]You guys heard that over there, didn't you?
[133:44.06]There's nothing there.
[133:48.42]Have I lost my mind completely?
[133:49.72]Or did you hear like a... Like that way.
[133:52.44]Like in this ear.
[133:54.22]In your left ear.
[133:56.90]I heard it.
[133:58.36]It was fucking terrifying, Mike.
[133:59.84]Alright, gotta put these back on.
[134:04.15]I'm crazy, crazy, crazy.
[134:05.27]I heard it, but you're still crazy.
[134:06.25]I don't know what it was, man.
[134:07.11]Who knows?
[134:07.47]I don't know what the fuck's going on.
[134:09.31]Alright, let's go.
[134:12.90]Uh, we have to... Alright, so there was another way to walk that's past these doors.
[134:19.67]Not the janitor room.
[134:21.01]Up here.
[134:26.29]Here's Mr. King.
[134:29.01]Should we not even ask any questions?
[134:30.36]Just get rid of him?
[134:30.84]I think we're just gonna get rid of him.
[134:42.06]That was good enough, right?
[134:44.62]Uh, picture an excellent... An excellent likeness in oil.
[134:49.21]Ashtray.
[134:51.41]Uh, do I... Watch me have to beat this guy in chess.
[134:56.97]I am the chess master.
[134:59.45]Any initiate who wishes to pass this way must do so over my dead body.
[135:05.35]That's all you need to say.
[135:07.73]I offer my opponents a choice.
[135:10.50]Solve my problem or fight me to the death.
[135:14.46]Do you know how to play chess?
[135:18.00]Yes, I know how to play chess.
[135:20.35]Wait, I have to checkmate him?
[135:26.07]Okay, how do I play chess?
[135:28.17]I think it's so... This... The horse can only move in one direction.
[135:30.51]Where's his?
[135:31.63]That's his king.
[135:32.35]So it's right here, right?
[135:36.37]Because he... Yeah, he can't move if it's over here.
[135:38.85]I win.
[135:39.85]Checkmate!
[135:40.23]Checkmate!
[135:47.93]That wasn't checkmate.
[136:05.20]That was too many things for me to comment.
[136:09.18]That was some Beauty and the Beast shit first and foremost.
[136:13.18]Second of all... What hit him in the head?
[136:18.77]He just got axed in the head.
[136:20.55]Somebody hit this guy with an axe.
[136:23.09]Examine these chairs.
[136:26.01]Operate the body?
[136:27.88]Oh my god.
[136:33.26]Chest key.
[136:46.99]Did a lot more damage than I thought.
[136:50.64]So I have a chess key.
[136:52.72]Trophies.
[136:54.30]First place trophy in the children's tournament.

[137:04.99]No, I just have a chess key now.
[137:06.51]What the hell does this have to do with this?
[137:11.67]Oh god, I'm trying to eat.
[137:13.21]Yeah, remember the guy that's... Remember the people that were saying earlier that don't talk about shit and bidets?
[137:20.25]Yeah, but you'll look at the inside of a guy's like grapefruit skull like that's alright, but I can't talk about a bidet Who is this fucking Andre the Giant?
[137:47.31]My flies up alright

[137:57.61]What was it?
[137:58.55]Secret door?
[137:59.27]I don't know where it is.
[138:00.91]You messed up Ichabod Crane.
[138:02.69]Oh fuck, we have to kill him again.
[138:23.55]Alright, we saw that.
[138:28.80]Go examine Operator's body.
[138:30.41]Make sure you're not eating.
[138:31.39]Don't stop eating.
[138:33.75]That's what we all... That's what... You know, what are you eating right now?
[138:36.85]Are you eating spaghetti?
[138:37.75]That's what spaghetti looks like on the inside.
[138:39.37]Are you eating beef?
[138:40.92]Are you eating chicken?
[138:41.64]That's what they look like.
[138:43.52]That's what a cow's head looks like when they crush it to make your hamburger.
[138:47.48]They rip it open like this and they take out all the tongue and the brain.
[138:51.64]And that's what's in your patty right now.
[138:54.94]That's what it looks like.
[138:56.95]Just being real.
[139:01.25]Okay.
[139:01.49]Okay.
[139:06.15]Um... So I need to be prepared.
[139:08.87]Put the side back on.
[139:14.23]Save it here.
[139:15.27]And I gotta go kill Andre the Giant.
[139:19.49]Vegan?
[139:19.63]What are you talking about?
[139:20.31]That's what the inside of a broccoli looks like too.
[139:21.91]Have you ever seen... Have you ever looked at a broccoli head?
[139:24.46]It's like... Holy fuck.
[139:25.48]It's like... Oh, it exploded.
[139:26.68]You can see like the brain and shit.
[139:27.76]You cut it off and there's like blood and stuff in there.
[139:30.66]Coming from somebody apparently that's never cooked in their life.
[139:34.86]You ever slice an asparagus?
[139:37.08]They scream.
[139:40.14]That, like, little crunch you hear, it's like... That's a scream.
[139:44.52]That's not a crunch.
[139:45.80]That's a scream.
[139:52.54]Alright, uh...
[140:02.96]I don't even- I don't know which one of these guys is even Kane.
[140:05.06]I'm sure we'll find out.
[140:19.23]Why is this the fucking last boss?
[140:20.99]He's so hard.
[140:25.27]He just goes for like, ball punches.
[140:28.56]Okay.
[140:30.30]I found a book.
[140:34.50]The stool.
[140:35.14]Mr. Kane's sole material possession since the death of his brother.
[140:42.52]And there's a hole there that I can't... I have the book.

[140:55.93]There's no reloading the shotgun, huh?
[141:00.47]Okay.
[141:00.91]I guess it's just a box now.
[141:01.91]Put the side back on.
[141:04.74]We need to save this here, because that was actually very difficult.
[141:07.46]That was hard.
[141:19.36]Combine it, it'll reload.
[141:20.40]You can reload it.
[141:21.98]That's what I was trying to do, isn't it?
[141:26.79]Okay, shotgun.

[146:16.08]It's the chess master's room.
[146:18.35]Mirror?
[146:18.71]No.
[146:19.01]Nothing locked in here.
[146:24.53]Give the janitor the money!
[146:25.81]Why is my chat fucked up?
[146:45.79]Alright, uh, give money to this guy?
[146:48.13]Alright, yeah, I know, I'm going to give the key to the lady.
[146:55.59]And watch, here's what's gonna happen.
[146:58.07]Nothing.
[147:00.04]You guys ready?
[147:02.42]Are you guys ready for nothing to fucking happen?
[147:11.54]Wait, so there's a door where the janitor is.
[147:14.84]Yeah, that's the door I came out of.
[147:15.92]There's no door here.
[147:19.64]You're talking about- You're talking about the door that I came in.
[147:24.30]Watch this.
[147:24.66]I'm gonna drag- I'm gonna drop the key on the lady and she's gonna go, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[147:36.57]If I can get the fuck out of this, like, mess of a goddamn hallway system.
[147:41.63]How do I get out of here?
[147:46.38]Here we go.
[147:46.76]Here we go.
[147:48.41]Everybody hold your fucking breath.
[147:50.09]Hold your breath.
[147:50.61]I don't know what that is.
[147:54.09]Can I help you?
[147:55.23]I want you all to apologize.
[147:59.37]All of you.
[148:05.14]I want a written apology from every single person.
[148:14.62]Sorry.
[148:15.23]Sorry.
[148:15.53]Sorry.
[148:35.84]I can touch these.
[148:41.60]Examine the hooked flail.
[148:43.74]A hooked flail.
[148:48.95]Okay.
[148:51.36]Is there another thing?
[148:52.04]God, this is like a hidden object game.
[148:55.84]I got the one hidden object.
[149:04.42]Save this.
[149:05.31]One of these is gonna fall and land on my head.
[149:07.31]I am not sorry.
[149:10.99]Alright.
[149:15.07]Where am I?
[149:15.53]Here's your book.
[149:16.37]Underground Acid Booger.
[149:17.31]We're already past that.
[149:20.44]This one's gonna be called Say Sorry.
[149:25.68]Ornate.
[149:26.50]You can look at them all.
[149:32.48]Nothing on this one.
[149:42.80]Come on.
[149:43.20]That's gotta be something to do with this shit.
[149:48.62]Was there only one item?
[149:50.42]That's it?
[149:52.04]There's just one item.
[149:58.80]I don't believe that.
[150:00.26]For a second.
[150:03.10]Flail the mirror.
[150:04.36]That's actually not a bad idea.
[150:05.52]There's a janitor blocking the path.
[150:13.99]I need to kill him.
[150:14.63]Did you see what happened when I tried to kill the janitor?
[150:17.98]He fucking destroyed me.
[150:24.95]Put a head on a pot.
[150:28.09]Put a head on a... Put a head on the pot again.
[150:32.89]Tell me I'm wrong, right?
[150:34.62]This has got to be something on one of these other pillars that I'm not seeing.
[150:36.98]And you guys have to help me play the hidden object game.
[150:51.84]Come on.
[150:55.28]Which one were we just on?
[150:56.39]This one?
[150:56.75]If you look closely, there's a dolphin.
[151:15.71]What's that?
[151:16.27]Nothing?
[151:18.65]This is a dolphin.
[151:25.03]There's nothing here.
[151:25.71]I'm wasting my fucking time.
[151:32.14]I'm gonna need to come back here.
[151:33.10]I swear to God, it's gonna be like, Oh, you know, there's vines!
[151:35.76]You gotta get the secret item that's on the vines!
[151:37.68]And I'm gonna be like, I told you guys that.
[151:50.89]No, I don't want to talk to this lady.
[151:55.67]I'll eventually figure it out.
[152:02.59]Let me see.
[152:04.11]Oh, yes.
[152:04.55]The new initiative.
[152:05.63]The QP guy.
[152:06.49]I'm the Lodge membership director.
[152:08.11]What can I do for you?
[152:12.24]Help me.
[152:12.72]Help me out here.
[152:13.28]Shortly, you will run into a fellow named Mr. Kane.
[152:16.48]He has the strength of the truly insane.
[152:19.74]You will need help to get past him.
[152:22.37]They say that music has charms to soothe the savage breast.
[152:27.95]Shut up.
[152:28.35]You fucking imbecile.
[152:40.15]These open.
[152:40.83]They have to.
[152:48.25]Something has to open this.
[153:00.38]Just kill the janitor.
[153:02.66]Everybody wants the janitor to die so bad.
[153:05.40]Go kill that fucking janitor.
[153:10.74]Yeah, the key does not work on the door.
[153:16.52]It's hard to kill the janitor.
[153:17.74]He has plus 40 knockback.
[153:27.06]No.
[153:30.94]I have, like, a chess key.
[153:33.32]But I don't know what the hell to do with it.
[153:36.34]These doors don't open.
[153:42.31]This is where the chess master was.
[153:46.17]Use the fl- I did just get a flail.
[153:54.37]Ashtray.
[153:59.50]He found a shotgun shell.
[154:01.58]He found a shotgun shell.
[154:04.54]Okay, I can put the shotgun back on.
[154:06.22]That's good.
[154:09.73]How many shots do I have?
[154:11.45]Three?
[154:12.09]Save it.
[154:19.13]Why would they... Now shoot the janitor with the shotgun.
[154:25.93]Should I go kill the janitor with the shotgun?
[154:27.67]What do you think?
[154:37.16]Three shotgun shots to the janitor's face incoming.
[154:46.02]Fine.
[154:47.67]Let's go kill the fucking janitor.
[154:53.09]He's not in here.
[154:54.01]Where's the janitor?
[154:55.11]I don't want to kill the janitor.
[154:57.85]The poor janitor didn't do anything.
[155:03.89]Look, he's got it coming, apparently.
[155:05.26]Here comes the boss fight.
[155:06.44]Hi, janitor.
[155:09.48]You guys wanted this.
[155:10.32]I shot too many times.
[155:14.28]I need to shoot this guy once.
[155:15.14]Shotgun shots.
[155:15.64]I'm gonna shoot him one time.
[155:18.66]This better be the right call.
[155:36.01]rip.
[155:36.45]Stop saying that.
[155:39.01]I'm not even going to give him a chance to speak.
[155:44.80]Why did he not die?
[155:46.38]Is there actual damage?
[155:47.70]There's damage falloff.
[155:52.10]There's damage falloff.
[155:54.00]He can't hit me.
[155:57.14]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[156:10.92]I just, like, bopped him on the head.
[156:24.88]And it instantly killed him.
[156:27.18]Shotgun shells.
[156:28.08]This time I'm not gonna take a thousand points of damage.
[156:33.26]Jesus Christ.
[156:39.64]Get close.
[156:40.20]It takes him a minute to pull out.
[156:41.60]Yep, his quickdraw is not that good.
[156:43.74]Why?
[156:43.82]I don't know how he died, but he did.
[156:48.79]He bled to death.
[156:49.53]I'm not giving him the $200.
[156:51.67]That's my money.
[157:07.65]Grabbing the nail gun, you add it to your inventory, hoping it will come in handy.
[157:15.91]Examine the curtain.
[157:17.53]Melodramas involving the brutal murder of men by ungrateful suffragettes are popular.
[157:22.49]Yes, they are.
[157:23.03]So, now I have a nail gun.
[157:25.38]I guess I can keep going this way?
[157:31.56]Ballroom door.
[157:32.62]Might we have to save this?
[157:40.71]Selfish streamer.
[157:41.79]No, I need that for something.
[157:45.99]You can't assume that I'm not going to need that money for something later.
[157:51.18]I have no more shotgun shells.
[157:52.34]Back to the harvest.
[157:53.08]Door's locked.
[157:55.48]I have the chest key.
[157:56.94]That should do it.
[157:59.06]Okay.
[158:00.02]Here we go.
[158:02.92]Okay.
[158:10.30]I'll put a fucking chainsaw in that room.
[158:19.03]Wish I had the shotgun.
[158:28.23]A shotgun would come in handy right now, that's for sure.
[158:31.35]Oy yi yi.
[158:36.55]I gotta be good about this then.
[158:41.94]Syringe clown upgraded.
[158:43.94]Of course it's a fucking clown.
[158:45.24]Alright, just be ready for it.
[158:49.88]You can't... Alright.
[158:55.79]Grabbing the chainsaw, you add it to your inventory, hoping it will come in handy.
[158:59.17]You also find a Kewpie doll and something that looks like a key.
[159:03.91]We got our Kewpie doll.
[159:05.94]From inside of this disgusting clown.
[159:09.08]That's my favorite game.
[159:09.86]I love watching, like, the Let's Play of that game.
[159:11.10]It's fantastic.
[159:11.48]I was gonna just say somebody's name, but I don't wanna, like, cause, like, drama.
[159:36.78]Replace, alright, replace Let's Play with like any streamer you, any YouTuber you've ever watched.
[159:42.88]There you go.
[159:47.64]Could have got myself in a little bit of trouble there.
[159:51.14]Happy gas.
[159:53.51]I can't do anything else.
[159:54.33]There's a door though.
[159:57.81]Rocket.
[160:00.63]It's a red rocket.
[160:03.91]Examine the cake.
[160:05.51]Nothing to do with the cake.
[160:06.35]Door.
[160:06.49]That is the same door.
[160:13.70]A blood spatter movie screen or are you back in the art gallery again?
[160:16.98]I don't know.
[160:18.64]Let's see.
[160:22.25]They're really... Why am I wearing these?
[160:24.21]Take them off.
[160:26.23]People are actually going to come into this stream and be like, fuck this guy.
[160:30.81]Why are you wearing those?
[160:32.67]I hate when people wear those when they play games that are not necessary for them.
[160:38.23]I look like a shill.
[160:46.52]Clown goods.
[160:49.66]Alright, let's go give the Kewpie Pie doll to the magician Dumbledore looking asshole up top.
[160:57.90]Put them back on.
[161:01.12]Implying I wasn't a shill.
[161:03.79]Excuse me.
[161:06.45]When have I ever pushed a pro- That's a new viewer.
[161:12.01]I've never pushed a product on stream, ever.
[161:14.47]Or on a YouTube video in my life, ever.
[161:17.68]No sponsored content from this motherfucker.
[161:20.08]I can guarantee you, but these are comfy.
[161:23.10]And they feel good on the face.
[161:24.30]Smell good too?
[161:27.71]Hmm.
[161:29.13]I would recommend those.
[161:31.67]For a dollar or two.
[161:33.13]Not this way.
[161:42.05]You sponsored Garfield that one time.
[161:44.81]Yeah, well, that was different.
[161:48.35]How dirty is my hair?
[161:49.28]There's like 3,000 people here.
[161:51.58]Let me make sure I don't look like a fucking moron.
[161:57.34]I do.
[161:58.64]Very much so.
[161:59.86]I didn't take a shower.
[162:01.64]I woke up and let me make sure the hair's not that fucked up.
[162:04.14]It is bad.
[162:05.44]Real bad.
[162:07.89]I look like I'm wearing a sad toupee. ...
[162:17.93]I don't normally look like that.
[162:18.89]I look way better than this on a daily basis.
[162:26.45]Nice, like, bald head.
[162:27.97]Just shake the head like a dog.
[162:36.87]That just turned me into Willard.
[162:42.34]Whatever.
[162:43.20]Like, you think I, like, I give a fuck.
[162:45.60]I do.
[162:46.16]Very much so.
[162:46.92]My appearance!
[162:47.91]My appearance is all that matters!
[162:49.29]Alright, let's close this.
[163:03.16]Can't go in this hole.
[163:09.78]Get a haircut, hippie.
[163:11.98]Actually, I do need a cricket.
[163:13.50]You're right.
[163:14.22]You are right.
[163:18.58]You are... That's a true statement.
[163:20.33]I'm not going to combat that at all.
[163:22.53]Alright, this is the chess room.
[163:24.17]Where's Dumbledore?
[163:27.09]Down the hall and down, right?
[163:30.59]Where the fuck is Dumbledore?
[163:32.33]No.
[163:32.99]I'm like walking in fucking circles.
[163:37.66]Over here.
[163:38.14]Up.
[163:39.12]Up.
[163:41.05]No.
[163:43.45]Down.
[163:45.36]Left.
[163:48.00]Up.
[163:49.96]Here.
[163:51.82]There he is.
[163:52.40]Okay, here.
[163:52.88]Let's save this.
[163:54.00]Give him the kiwi pie.
[163:58.07]Don't make fun of my sense of direction when this part of the game is just like, what?
[164:05.39]Like, where are you even supposed to go?
[164:07.77]Don't make fun of my sense of direction when this, you got this on the screen.
[164:14.19]If I was playing anything else, I would take your insult.
[164:18.21]And this is called QB.
[164:24.71]Fine work.
[164:26.56]You're obviously an earnest young man.
[164:29.01]You're in luck.
[164:30.21]A quick check of my records indicates that, indeed, a woman was brought into the lodge, although I neglected to get her name, since females are generally not considered for initiation.
[164:40.53]The young lady is currently being detained on the third floor in the Chapel of Love.
[164:46.29]Chapel of Love.
[164:47.89]Seek her there.
[164:49.67]And don't forget to bring her her prize.
[164:52.09]Her, her, her best.
[164:52.63]Little things mean so much.
[164:55.47]Her, her.
[164:55.95]They could have written that a little bit better.
[164:57.79]Alright, this is my Kewpie Pie doll.
[165:03.09]Does that not do anything?
[165:05.47]Kewpie Key?
[165:06.31]Kewpie Doll?
[165:07.11]Kewpie Key?
[165:09.19]Hooked flail.
[165:10.01]So she's in the... How do I get to the third floor?
[165:20.07]Yeah, I could pay him.
[165:21.11]Maybe I should pay him off.
[165:39.44]Uh, the only other lock that we can do is if we go over here.
[165:43.86]No, down, down, down.
[165:48.70]Slash of, no, I'm not slashing them.
[165:50.56]This is the only other log.
[165:51.76]Kewpie key?
[165:55.84]Kewpie key, Kewpie door, Kewpie restaurant.
[166:10.93]I know it's not spelled right.
[166:12.09]Restaurant.
[166:12.73]I'm just typing it fast.
[166:18.34]This is the theater.
[166:22.54]Okay.
[166:26.45]Uh... There's a flag.
[166:28.89]A flag on a pole.
[166:32.55]Another flag.
[166:33.15]I have two flags now.
[166:37.92]Nothing else?
[166:45.13]Backstage we have lunch box operate the lunch box you grab a sandwich out of the lunch box and put it away for later So this is that's healing hammer I Can't pick up the hammer barrels explosive barrels Props planks Staircase that goes up to level three Lovely lavender wall people donated by fireman Sparky prop
[167:15.65]Kitchen prop, non-functioning.
[167:17.77]I got a sandwich from here.
[167:20.83]Time to go upstairs.
[167:21.49]Alright.
[167:33.39]Examine the staircase leading nowhere.
[167:35.45]What?
[167:36.53]I could have just looked at that.
[167:43.11]Well, what are those two flagpoles for?
[167:52.37]A wooden plank.
[167:57.43]Wait, what the fuck am I gonna do with that?
[168:00.89]Staircase.
[168:01.81]Doesn't lead to anything.
[168:18.62]Wood plank.
[168:19.12]I'm gonna have to build a fort?
[168:22.24]Is that it?
[168:22.58]Are there any more wooden planks?
[168:30.82]Move the wooden planks.
[168:33.87]To where?
[168:36.11]Shove both flagpoles up your area and end the game.
[168:45.59]I don't understand.
[168:50.08]Build pillow fort.
[168:58.00]Okay, well, it's been real.
[169:00.47]There's another one.
[169:05.33]Alright, we're building something here.
[169:07.57]Do I need to use the hammer?
[169:12.57]Examine the door, examine the cooler.
[169:16.01]Examine the chair.
[169:18.67]Masks?
[169:20.45]Operate the masks.
[169:23.03]Oh lord.
[169:23.67]It's the happy sad theater thing.
[169:25.19]Operate the happy mask.
[169:31.04]God, I have no idea.
[169:45.56]There's got to be an image somewhere to operate these.
[169:51.69]There has to be.
[169:54.25]Well, there's a door, so let me just save it again.
[170:06.68]Happy masks.
[170:07.48]Happy masks.
[170:14.31]I got plenty of time to react.
[170:24.86]Zombie dead.
[170:27.00]Fire extinguisher.
[170:27.96]Standard type C fire extinguisher.
[170:30.98]Some dust or cocaine on the ground.
[170:33.74]Pick your choice.
[170:35.47]Examine the machine.
[170:36.31]Complementary coffin nails.
[170:42.52]Tastes great.
[170:43.16]What the hell was the point of coming in here?
[170:47.15]Is there nothing in here?
[171:00.11]It's just, those are cigarettes, but can I, like, smash it or something?
[171:03.01]They're paid $200?
[171:05.57]Oh, man.
[171:10.92]Cigarettes are expensive.
[171:11.92]Eat the sandwich.
[171:14.84]Chainsaw.
[171:15.82]Nail gun.
[171:17.33]Okay.
[171:17.99]Wait, what about nail gun on the boards?
[171:19.61]Well, that didn't work.
[171:20.83]Oh, man.
[171:23.87]Smash.
[171:24.87]Smash it.
[171:31.30]Lighter fluid.
[171:34.12]That helps with whatever I don't know.
[171:41.57]I don't think there's anything else in here.
[171:47.49]I have matches.
[171:50.20]No, I don't.
[171:51.32]What happened to matches?
[171:52.08]I had matches before.
[171:54.02]There's a little exit here.
[172:13.45]That's where I came in.
[172:16.63]What do I do with the planks?
[172:18.85]Alright, let's try upside down.
[172:41.04]Right side up, no.
[172:43.28]Upside down, right side up.
[173:18.08]Intelligence!
[173:20.00]Activate!
[173:21.46]Something happened.
[173:24.18]The door opened.
[173:34.68]New door.
[173:36.38]Oh.
[173:37.02]I'm in.

[173:42.42]Washers.
[173:44.24]Dryers.
[173:45.06]Baskets.
[173:51.46]Washer is another bunch of crap that's not here.
[173:54.68]I guess I can keep going.
[173:55.68]Save this game.
[173:56.40]No, I already have it saved.
[173:57.24]What am I talking about?
[174:00.10]You got to spin the masks to do the laundry.
[174:07.43]Blood red water swirls around.
[174:08.99]Let's just go out.
[174:11.95]I think I actually have to do the laundry and it's going to cost $200.
[174:16.87]Clothes.
[174:17.45]These look like Stephanie's clothes.
[174:20.31]So she must be in this door.
[174:26.29]I guess.
[174:30.85]Okay, switch box.
[174:31.85]A power fuse box.
[174:34.30]A power meter box.
[174:35.36]Apparently we're about to dive.
[174:37.04]We're diving.
[174:37.66]We're going like 30,000 leagues under the sea.
[174:42.46]And this is cut off.
[174:45.36]Examine the valve.
[174:46.20]This cut off valve is rusted.
[174:47.48]It won't budge.
[174:52.05]The door is locked.
[174:56.75]Chainsaw?
[175:05.84]Alright, examine the pipe.
[175:07.10]A good usable pipe.
[175:10.68]The steam hisses as the alarm sounds two, three.
[175:17.20]Wrench.
[175:18.38]I got a wrench now.
[175:19.84]Battery.
[175:21.46]Battery's dead.
[175:27.95]Oh, God.
[175:28.65]Examine the pipe.
[175:29.57]There's so much equipment.
[175:33.91]Switch box.
[175:36.25]I'm going to have to build a robot in here.
[175:40.49]Well, that didn't work.

[176:04.02]Nothing else I can do.
[176:05.68]Also, this door is locked.
[176:07.36]Switch box.
[176:07.94]I can't do anything here.
[176:13.96]I have to imagine it's like I gotta go back to the wrench and turn it off.
[176:20.31]wrench valve the wrench isn't much help the valve is stuck solid we can cut through with the chainsaw okay well that didn't work okay fully charged battery but I can't pick it up
[176:55.31]There's another valve up here.
[176:56.29]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

[182:45.63]Alright, release the steam.
[182:50.45]Boiler room key.
[182:54.14]Ceiling?
[182:54.54]What are you talking about the ceiling?
[182:58.92]What do you mean the ceiling?
[183:04.99]Like my ceiling?
[183:08.94]guys are talking about.
[183:10.82]I forgot my face cam was on.
[183:14.46]I just see like, oh my god, the fucking ceiling is caving in.
[183:17.71]I'm like, the ceiling's caving in?
[183:19.79]What?
[183:23.75]The ceiling.
[183:24.73]I look up and the ceiling's like right here.
[183:29.33]It's been Indiana Jones-ing me this whole stream.
[183:33.03]I look up and I'm just like, oh shit!
[183:35.19]It's like closing down.
[183:36.09]I have to like snake over there and get out of the room.
[183:40.25]That's fucking so funny.
[183:41.45]Alright, so I got the boiler room key.
[183:47.31]That should lead us out here.
[183:54.33]Boiler key.
[183:55.01]Key on door.
[183:58.40]Enter.
[184:05.85]That was just traitor.
[184:09.34]That was TR-8R from fucking Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[184:12.98]It's too bad it didn't dance.
[184:14.02]It's a meme.
[184:14.64]I know.
[184:15.36]We don't do those here very often.
[184:20.04]Get over it.
[184:21.03]It was a Star Wars meme.
[184:22.73]The you spin me right round thing.
[184:28.35]Sorry I even brought it up.
[184:39.20]Examine the generator.
[184:40.54]The turbines scream in a high-pitched whine.
[184:48.40]Can I throw... Should I throw, like, the lighter fluid in here?
[184:54.26]Don't I want to, like, destroy this thing?
[184:56.32]Alright, well, whatever.
[184:57.06]I'll probably come back.
[184:59.37]Another door.
[185:02.09]Lava everywhere.
[185:02.93]I'm gonna go to the diving board.
[185:07.17]The hot molten lava has melted this section of the floor.
[185:11.39]Sure it has.
[185:15.03]Lighter fluid?
[185:18.37]Well, that didn't work.
[185:19.45]How would I want to do that?
[185:21.43]I can still eat this sandwich.
[185:27.05]Though we do have... Can I put these down?
[185:33.51]Okay?
[185:38.84]I don't even need it.
[185:40.46]I don't even need another one.
[185:48.27]I hear a monster.
[185:51.45]Alright, where's the... Are you fucking kidding me?
[186:01.23]How do I stop it?
[186:02.83]How do I stop this from happening?
[186:04.62]The fucking ceiling.
[186:06.78]Is Indiana Jones-ing me?
[186:08.94]That's interesting.
[186:11.37]Uh... I think we're gonna get crushed.
[186:14.55]Because I don't fucking know how to stop this.
[186:21.83]Damn it!
[186:24.16]What?
[186:24.58]Come on!
[186:27.38]Glue?
[186:28.60]Stop!
[186:29.22]Damn it!
[186:29.68]Nail it somewhere!
[186:30.90]Oh, that'll work.
[186:44.57]Use the flags.
[186:45.81]That's, you know, I didn't even think of that.
[186:50.05]Traitor!
[186:53.83]Make sure you put those boards down.
[186:55.09]I was trying to, I was trying to, like, take a board and go like this and balance it on its ends.
[187:00.41]It would point up and stop it.
[187:05.75]How is a flagpole going to be any better than a board?
[187:10.24]Okay, here we go.
[187:10.92]Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[187:17.18]Here's one flag on a cement base.
[187:21.22]Here's the other flag on this base.
[187:24.36]Bingo.
[187:25.32]Now we're fine.
[187:26.56]Now it's not gonna come down and crush our head.
[187:30.76]Although, do we need the board anywhere?
[187:34.85]No, we're good to go.
[187:39.35]So this is gonna stop here.
[187:40.39]We're gonna be able to look around.
[187:41.37]Uh, cement base.
[187:47.20]Why is there another cement base?
[187:49.28]Why is there another cement base?
[187:50.24]Hold on.
[187:53.30]Okay, that's fine.
[187:55.26]Can I take these now?
[187:58.33]No, I don't even want to.
[187:59.79]No items in here, right?
[188:03.87]A limestone stalagmite.
[188:07.63]You guys know it's stalagmite and stalactite.
[188:10.03]We want another way to decipher between them.
[188:12.11]A stalactite...
[188:14.34]is from the ceiling because you stalactite.
[188:17.68]It needs to be because it's hanging.
[188:19.44]Stalagmite means it's growing out of the ground.
[188:22.88]If it is tight, think of it, you know, it's hard to hold on to something, so it has to hang from the ceiling.
[188:27.39]You're gonna ace the next fucking geography test.
[188:31.07]Geology test.
[188:35.75]It's like a random police officer.
[188:37.37]Cut the guy in half.
[188:45.22]Time to go up.
[188:46.56]We're almost up.
[188:50.02]I wish some of these people would talk.
[188:51.22]It would be a lot funnier.
[188:55.66]More shotgun shells.
[188:57.61]Keep on the scythe.
[188:59.83]Save.
[189:11.21]Cop before rope.
[189:12.25]That's what we're gonna call this one.
[189:15.37]Here we go.
[189:16.41]A rope up to level three.
[189:18.89]You can hear a familiar scream.
[189:21.37]Climb up to investigate.
[189:24.05]So this has got to be like the final room, right?
[189:27.42]This is the last room.
[189:31.76]I do have a chain.
[189:32.42]You know what?
[189:32.84]I do have a chainsaw.
[189:34.12]Let's put the chainsaw on.
[189:38.08]Oh, it does use gas.
[189:39.44]Why am I not using this?
[189:42.82]Save.
[189:56.31]Alright.
[189:56.89]Chainsaw, last boss.
[189:58.41]Here's the door.
[189:59.01]The door is locked from the other side.
[190:00.57]We go do one quick little puzzle.
[190:05.01]One quick little puzzle!
[190:13.62]This is the temple of the mystery of abstinence.
[190:16.10]Do not eat of the food or you will be punished.
[190:18.62]All within are hereby bound to a vow of abstinence.
[190:20.70]Abstinence?
[190:22.78]This gets... Operate the hamburger?
[190:26.38]Is this a human?
[190:28.38]This is the temple of the mis- The central mystery is thus.
[190:38.59]Those who advocate abstinence are those who possess the most.
[190:42.13]It is to their advantage that you obey, not to yours.
[190:45.98]The meek shall inherit the Earth when the strong are finished with it.
[190:49.96]Advance, initiate, and remember what you have learned.
[191:03.22]That little turn and smile was so stupid Okay, so kill Elvis last That dude was wearing some gunner optics he had gunner optics on that's how he could get so many good shots
[191:25.94]So I'm not going to eat the food.
[191:28.22]Don't eat the food.
[191:29.92]Just walk over here.
[191:32.12]And then we're going to go chainsaw.
[191:33.86]No, we're going to go down, left, chainsaw.
[191:37.49]I'm going to chainsaw this guy from the other side.
[191:50.44]God damn it, man!
[191:59.62]He is eating the hamburgers, though.
[192:02.84]If I examine the table, I'll eat the burger.
[192:04.36]I don't want to eat the burger.
[192:09.46]This is the temple of the mystery of abstinence.
[192:11.33]Do not eat the food.
[192:11.93]Do not eat... Okay, we'll just wait till Claymation Fat Elvis is done eating, and we'll be done.
[192:22.19]Examine the plant.
[192:22.91]A decorative plant.
[192:26.99]Wish I had a gun.
[192:31.39]You obey well, Initiate.
[192:33.10]Better than your brethren.
[192:34.74]They have eaten and grown stronger for it.
[192:37.42]As promised, I will not punish you for your obedience.
[192:40.80]But they will.
[192:48.78]Why did he attack me?
[192:49.66]What did I do wrong?
[192:53.33]You obey well, Initiate.
[192:55.39]Well, let's save it.
[192:57.17]Like, I let him finish his food.
[192:58.51]That naked fat guy just... Okay, whatever.
[193:09.33]I feel like out of context, that is a moderately offensive name for something.
[193:32.04]Yeah, my cat flock has been on for like three hours.
[193:37.50]Here's door, one door.
[193:40.98]and some mothers complain that their children don't come to see them shocked this is the mystery of motherly love everyone says motherhood is fulfilling when in reality it's draining
[194:11.24]Oh, yes.
[194:12.82]I'm such a pessimist.
[194:15.46]What you must think of me.
[194:18.32]You don't know the half of it.
[194:26.26]What is it?
[194:26.70]What?
[194:26.90]I... No!
[194:29.04]No!

[194:36.58]No thanks, kids.
[194:38.68]I'm gonna have to use a pool cue for this one.
[194:44.29]Those are just small people, okay?
[194:46.33]Those are small people.
[194:47.75]Those were not... Other than that, they were small people.
[194:58.23]Don't talk about bidets, Jeremy.
[195:00.65]Don't talk about bidets.
[195:02.59]Whatever you do.
[195:04.89]That's disgusting.
[195:10.70]She just went down an elevator.
[195:12.30]That wasn't even her body.
[195:13.58]I'm going with the baseball bat.
[195:34.79]This door is locked from the other side.
[195:37.57]Locked on the other side.
[195:38.41]Anything in here besides that disgusting fucking grotesque stream.
[195:42.83]Remember, if you're over the age of 18, have a fucking swell day.
[195:49.36]If you're not, then you're in trouble.
[195:53.20]You're in trouble.
[195:54.61]You're not supposed to be here right now, apparently.
[195:58.29]Anyways.
[196:05.00]Welcome to the temple of the mystery of religion.
[196:09.07]The mystery is this.
[196:14.53]Those who preach love and mercy in God's name are often those who call for the death of heathens.
[196:24.35]Do you believe in God, my son?
[196:32.33]Uh, I'm gonna, yes.
[196:33.43]You are wise.
[196:34.61]His mercy anoints us all.
[196:39.79]And where doth he dwell, the Lord?
[196:44.97]In all of us.
[196:45.93]What?
[196:47.49]That's what it is!
[196:50.26]He's in all of us!
[196:52.08]John... Ribbony!
[196:53.20]If we need to open your eyes, we're gonna shut your eyes first.
[196:58.78]This guy's dragging me!
[197:00.36]Okay.
[197:12.26]This is clearly like somebody's son as an extra.
[197:25.19]I was going for a Bill Clinton thing there and I just didn't have an opportunity to.
[197:27.79]Alright, where the hell am I going?
[197:31.42]This is just grotesque.
[197:34.50]A metal on the gas can?
[197:36.98]Operate the gas can?
[197:40.29]Examine the can.
[197:42.54]Ashes.
[197:45.02]The door is locked on the other side.
[197:46.26]Where am I?
[197:49.98]Wait, what is happening?
[197:51.94]Hold on.
[197:52.32]You think it's that simple, huh?
[197:55.49]Just passing through?
[197:56.33]Well, my family was just sitting around.
[197:58.91]And look where it got them.
[198:03.17]What is this?
[198:03.69]The Temple of the Mystery of Morality.
[198:07.33]My country paid me to kill.
[198:09.97]And then when I came home, I was out of a job.
[198:13.45]They expected me to stop?
[198:15.41]Reload the chainsaw, yeah.
[198:16.89]Is that what they wanted?
[198:18.23]A paycheck today, jail cell tomorrow?
[198:21.55]Am I a criminal or an entrepreneur?
[198:24.44]Hey, let's find out.
[198:35.36]I feel like this is gonna be hard.
[198:38.37]Oh, god damn it.
[198:39.01]We're all the way back in naked fucking fat.
[198:40.59]We have to do this again.
[198:41.55]Did I not save after this?
[198:42.81]Shit.
[198:43.55]I didn't save after this.
[198:45.93]God damn it.
[198:46.97]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[198:58.58]Make it quick.
[199:01.17]Make it quick, make it quick!
[199:05.67]Don't even let them- just spawn camp them, don't even let them stand up.
[199:07.75]Uh-oh.
[199:23.17]Say- No, I don't believe in God, who cares?
[199:30.24]Don't die.
[199:30.66]I don't want to do that again.
[199:33.00]I got his head cut off.
[199:38.98]Alright.
[199:41.91]How am I on health?
[199:47.81]I'm fine.
[199:49.05]Save this game.
[199:50.53]Equip the chainsaw.
[199:53.27]I don't want to do that again.
[199:55.71]It's too much for me right now.
[200:01.56]More deaths.
[200:02.38]Secret door, more deaths.
[200:03.42]That's fine.
[200:03.86]Alright.
[200:04.30]We're going... I don't think it matters.
[200:06.10]Door's locked on the other side.
[200:09.42]Is this... Gas can... Don't I... Fill up the chainsaw with gas.
[200:23.05]Save him the ashes.
[200:24.31]Save him the body.
[200:27.73]Everyone's been just murdered.
[200:29.14]Alright, that's fine.
[200:30.66]I don't think I can come back this way.
[200:34.50]What do you want here?
[200:35.86]I'm... Oh, that's what they told me when I murdered my family.
[200:39.84]Whatever.
[200:41.22]My country pays.
[200:43.40]And chainsaw.
[200:51.29]This guy is the hardest enemy in the game.
[200:54.47]My chainsaw's not... I have to use the pull Q on that guy.
[201:02.30]Pool cue needs to be used here because it has reach.
[201:08.22]Pool cue.
[201:11.37]Does it even have fucking enough reach?
[201:13.17]Ah, the nail gun.
[201:19.19]Okay, good.
[201:24.99]You're right, nail gun.
[201:28.14]What do you want?
[201:28.80]I'm
[201:31.02]You killed your family.
[201:32.41]You're a bad guy.
[201:33.57]Five.
[201:40.43]Six.
[201:41.61]Seven.
[201:42.75]Eight.
[201:43.63]Eight.
[201:43.81]You find nothing usable on the body.
[201:46.15]Examine the corpse.
[201:47.00]A bloody corpse.
[201:51.02]Alright.
[201:51.38]We're gonna say we're gonna put the nail gun away now.
[201:53.08]Because we might need that later.
[202:03.46]Okay, put the nail gun away.
[202:04.92]Let's put on the chainsaw.
[202:07.90]Full gas.
[202:11.59]And lamp.
[202:12.71]Nice lamp.
[202:13.57]That's why I examined the couch.
[202:14.63]Nice couch.
[202:16.67]TV.
[202:17.33]Range Riders Cowboy Roundup reruns.
[202:22.60]There he is.
[202:23.16]There's Mr. Potsdam.
[202:24.04]Mr. Potsdam?
[202:29.86]The mystery is this.
[202:30.92]Sometimes you have to lose some meat to get some meat.
[202:36.06]They wouldn't let me in until I demonstrated my worthiness.
[202:40.66]My invitation came after I buried Karen alive.
[202:45.11]That showed initiative.
[202:48.35]And her spinal cord was your ticket in, right?
[202:51.83]Yes, but to be initiated into the mysteries of the harvest, I had to do one last thing.
[202:57.01]I let them into the house and into Stephanie's bedroom.
[203:03.76]My God, you do that to your own daughter.
[203:05.24]Sometimes you have to sacrifice me to gain meat.
[203:08.22]The order taught me that.
[203:10.60]Now I am a butcher.
[203:12.56]You should have gotten your dad to hire me on.
[203:15.47]That way, you could have been the boss.
[203:17.91]Like me, because I'm the final boss.
[203:20.25]I'm the last boss.
[203:23.04]See?
[203:23.54]I knew it.
[203:23.90]He has like fucking cabal spears.
[203:26.06]Let's go, buddy.
[203:27.50]Final boss.

[205:29.79]Uh, you're a little vain, huh?
[205:31.25]You insult my beauty?
[205:33.88]You feel the pain from a hooker's disease.
[205:35.64]Does she have a machine gun?
[205:36.44]No.
[205:38.39]She's gonna claw me.
[205:39.13]What do I have?

[206:05.35]The game crashed.
[206:06.51]Like a hard crash.
[206:14.89]I got cat clawed and the game stopped.
[206:19.17]I got hookered to death.
[206:24.51]Alright.
[206:38.84]Please wait.
[206:44.36]Well, this is the beginning of the game.

[207:11.79]Which one is it again?
[207:14.81]Is it Nailgun Away?

[207:25.08]I think it is this one.
[207:32.61]Disk 3.
[207:39.03]Shit, we have to go through this again.
[207:40.75]Alright, this time I'm not paying any money.
[207:43.17]This time I'm just swinging.
[207:49.81]Oh, fuck.
[207:50.35]I forgot to save for this.
[207:59.68]Here he is.

[210:03.94]$200, reasonable price.
[210:04.65]What a bunch of skanky whores.
[210:09.09]Such is the mystery of lust.
[210:11.25]So often, the instruments of lust, as all instruments of higher pleasure, are condemned as frequently as they are sought after.
[210:17.88]I'd go on about the hypocrisy of a xenophobic society, but I think I'd rather just kill me a man.
[210:24.26]Alright, but you come at me first.
[210:41.46]Alright, the door is locked.

[211:00.03]That's something wrong.
[211:01.03]That's being wrong.
[211:09.84]We're gonna tell this person right away that they're ugly.
[211:14.97]Dark woman.
[211:16.29]Yeah, yeah.
[211:17.15]You're not that hot.
[211:18.29]Alright.
[211:25.54]Off with her head.
[211:27.50]Save it again.
[211:28.58]How many more people do we have to kill in this place?
[211:38.93]See got only one way to go here we go Welcome initiate to the temple of the mystery of this The mystery is thus the simple manipulation of nerves may break one man and yet leave another unmoved He's gonna break this guy's biology is the same he is going to drag that Yet the results differ The question can only be answered by paradox
[212:07.41]Although the body functions according to the tenets of science, the invocation of pain is an art.
[212:14.98]My implements are simple things, like a painter's brushes, from which beautiful complexities spring.
[212:22.88]Different stories brought forth from different canvases with the different applications of a stroke.
[212:33.22]Worst massage ever.
[212:33.86]Oh damn it, I killed him!
[213:02.74]Oh.
[213:04.40]Whoops.

[214:06.80]Save.
[214:15.84]Short-term memory loss?
[214:17.06]No, it's called just writing random words and not applying them into my brain.
[214:20.97]Okay, so now, can I talk?
[214:26.63]No, just, just, whatever.
[214:31.09]Fucking fuck this constipation commercial.
[214:33.05]Alright, so I need to- I need to mow this guy down with the chainsaw.
[214:44.01]Welcome to the temple of the mystery of charity.
[214:47.49]What mystery is there in charity?
[214:49.18]For God's sake.
[214:51.00]The mystery is the...
[214:53.54]any act of charity is an act of selfishness for in any charitable exchange one must take from another and one is always left the poorer come out with that I see your point giver is not the power she's a great feeling from giving discouraging answer initiate
[215:13.09]You see, though I am needy, I do not consider myself a beggar so much as a taker.
[215:20.73]I require charity.
[215:22.01]Where else is this used?
[215:23.57]Give me something.
[215:28.14]This song.
[215:29.54]I can't, I can't get my head.
[215:34.88]Charity is a loathsome lie.
[215:37.84]The only gift that keeps on.
[215:41.72]Oh my lord in fucking heaven.
[215:46.58]It's just so... It's just roll the dice if you're going to hit someone.
[215:54.49]You have to save scum so much in this game because it's like almost impossible to hit anybody with a fucking item.
[215:59.21]Holy shit.
[216:05.03]I just need to use the scythe and just try to time it.
[216:07.24]No, you're not going to be able to time it.
[216:09.44]I don't even care.
[216:10.12]I know I saved it.
[216:11.22]I know I saved it.
[216:12.82]I don't care.
[216:13.44]The best melee weapon in the game is the worst melee weapon in the game.
[216:22.79]Just kill him.
[216:29.29]I should even fight this guy.
[216:31.95]Is he going to get me killed?
[216:36.96]This actually is going to get me killed.
[216:51.69]It's the flail.
[216:52.93]What's the range on the flail?
[216:56.55]It's pretty terrible, but let's try it.
[216:58.19]Why did I not hit him?
[217:04.02]Hit this guy, please.
[217:09.60]That was pretty good.
[217:13.31]That was pretty good!
[217:23.33]Flail good.
[217:29.26]Just go to the Ignorum?
[217:30.62]What?
[217:31.82]Why Ignorum?
[217:33.00]You're supposed to kill everybody.
[217:36.10]That's like what the point is here.
[217:37.48]Everybody dies.
[217:38.12]Go to hell.
[217:40.52]Oh my fucking god.
[217:53.80]Game crashed.
[218:07.15]Let's open it back up again.
[218:12.53]Jesus Christ.
[218:18.00]Give the right answer.
[218:20.14]There is no right answer.
[218:21.18]None of this matters.
[218:22.08]This is the whole end of the game.
[218:23.58]You just go around killing everybody.
[218:39.81]Pull this out.
[218:44.33]Answer his dialog correctly.
[218:47.69]Alright, let's answer the guy's dialog correctly.
[219:02.06]Four discs?
[219:02.66]What the hell was that?
[219:07.21]Alright.
[219:09.33]Answer his dialog correctly.
[219:11.25]Let's see what he says.
[219:12.84]Welcome to the temple.
[219:14.36]What mystery is there?
[219:16.02]The mystery is- Any act of charity is an act of selfishness.
[219:18.92]Any act of charity is an act of selfishness.
[219:22.27]For in any charitable exchange, one must take from another.
[219:26.05]Okay.
[219:30.03]So... Should I say I see your point?
[219:36.68]Ugly glasses?
[219:37.42]Fucking- I told you someone was gonna come in here and say that.
[219:40.44]They're off for good.
[219:45.53]Wouldn't I... One?
[219:47.11]I thought it was... My eyes hurt.
[219:53.17]I see your point.
[219:53.85]I'm glad you do.
[219:55.39]This way you'll understand.
[219:56.43]You see, though I am needy, I do not consider myself a beggar.
[220:01.83]I require charity, initiate, give me something.
[220:04.03]I require... Go to hell.
[220:06.55]I'm a taker, initiate.
[220:09.19]Allow me to take you there.
[220:13.48]Both options don't do anything.
[220:15.39]And I don't have any sandwiches.
[220:30.34]You can't answer correctly.
[220:32.97]I can't.
[220:33.59]I don't think I can beat this.
[220:40.99]There is no correct answer.
[220:42.29]You have to fight everybody.
[220:47.16]And look, no, you can't combine the shotgun shells.
[220:56.99]I don't have... I don't have any healing.
[221:02.95]There's a cheat code.
[221:10.44]Welcome.
[221:11.48]What if I just skip?
[221:14.62]You see.
[221:17.04]I can't give him anything.
[221:17.96]I don't have anything.
[221:18.72]Both these answers don't do anything.
[221:21.00]Can I leave?
[221:24.28]I can leave.
[221:25.99]Scummed it.

[225:24.84]Before he spawns.
[225:25.42]Come on, before he spawns the guy.
[225:27.88]Dude, this is the fucking way.

[225:39.70]It's impossible.
[225:46.59]I can't leave.
[226:00.46]Can't walk through the door.
[226:16.95]I softlocked the game on myself.
[226:22.08]I don't have any more bullets.
[226:23.16]I don't have any gun.
[226:26.60]I don't have any... I just have to get spawned on and just hope I can just... Is there a... What's crouch?
[226:31.90]Isn't there a crouch?
[226:33.54]That was... Ah.
[226:43.62]Go to the Vietnam Sack?
[226:45.22]Alright, well, we gotta go to Flail Good.
[226:52.92]So, blind guy, and then... Alright, let's go back to the Vietnam Sack.
[226:59.25]Where the fuck that was?
[227:14.50]Where are you talking about?
[227:17.52]Can.
[227:19.11]You eat the whole thing and feel refreshed.
[227:20.67]Alright, I got full health now.
[227:30.53]Use the reload button.
[227:35.62]Is there... I don't think there is a reload button.
[227:37.44]Is there a reload button?
[227:43.26]I'm fairly sure that doesn't exist.
[227:51.34]Look at controls for reload.
[227:57.01]Why is everybody telling me to do this?
[228:00.09]Quick tips!
[228:08.24]Craft bullets.
[228:12.39]Pull out your shells, this stuff!
[228:16.23]Guys, you have to remember, this game is from like 1995.
[228:26.61]First of all, let me just put this on.
[228:29.77]I'm doing a flail.
[228:30.45]I'm gonna do a blind skip.
[228:35.43]Blind skip actually works really well.
[228:43.06]examine the mirror okay I just picked up an item that I think I like needed good thing I have it alright so this is what save it right here
[229:07.77]type of murderer.
[229:08.83]Syringe?
[229:09.49]Okay, wait, more stuff that I didn't get.
[229:11.75]I have a syringe now.
[229:14.89]Okay, here's the blind guy.
[229:19.50]Skip.
[229:20.36]Mercy kill.
[229:21.18]Go to hell, doesn't matter.
[229:29.74]Right in the door.
[229:31.68]Here we are.
[229:32.60]Save it.
[229:34.11]After this.
[229:34.49]It's gonna be easy.
[229:39.85]Uh, no.
[229:44.23]Finish it.
[229:44.71]Congratulations, you win.
[229:51.88]Save it.
[229:55.12]Type Mordor?
[229:57.20]This one's gonna be called...
[230:05.96]We're in a good spot now.
[230:07.15]Time to win.
[230:10.41]Time to fucking win.
[230:18.99]Dude, like, how the fuck are you- this is not possible without a gun.
[230:32.91]It's just impossible without a firearm.
[230:36.29]I've lost the game.
[230:37.53]There's no winning.
[230:56.18]Help.
[231:14.77]Alt is duck.
[231:17.49]There is no reload.
[231:29.37]Alt isn't doing anything.
[231:41.79]I'm gonna have to use the chainsaw and try it again.
[231:48.33]I'm gonna try to get him against this wall.
[231:58.34]Dude, they made this game fucking impossible without a firearm in this spot right here.
[232:09.15]You can't kill this guy.
[232:10.41]He's not beatable unless you have a gun.
[232:15.60]I'm just gonna fucking cheat.
[232:16.88]I don't even care.
[232:18.70]What do I have to do?
[232:20.58]What do I type?
[232:21.68]What do I type right now to get infinite fucking money and shit?
[232:30.90]Thanks.
[232:34.90]And you know what?
[232:36.16]You're the first victim.
[232:47.28]Fill it up, boys.
[232:48.82]Fill it up, boys and girls.
[233:17.22]Not even matter.
[233:18.40]Typing of the dead.
[233:20.38]Alright.
[233:21.18]Here we are.
[233:22.24]Right?
[233:22.48]This has to be it.
[233:27.58]The end.
[233:28.32]Right?
[233:43.59]Welcome to the inner sanctum, big guy.
[233:46.25]Principal Harold?
[233:47.21]No, the principal did it.
[233:48.51]Within the inner sanctum, you will address me as Vice Muck Harold, second in command to the Grand Muckety-Muck.
[233:56.25]He of the pheasant buffalo helm, the secret handshake, the funny passwords.
[234:02.24]Only fitting, given that my role has always been that of an educator, and Harvest is one big classroom.
[234:09.22]What do you mean?
[234:10.26]Big reveal.
[234:10.72]You'll have to kill me to find out what he means, big guy.
[234:20.19]I killed them both.
[234:25.78]Fucking doors open Nick arcade was the wizard I believe you have something for No
[234:50.33]This guy looks very confused at the words that are coming out.
[235:05.31]He's thinking like, am I saying this right now?
[235:07.94]Strange.
[235:09.40]Is this the words that are coming out?
[235:11.70]I'm not saying them, am I?
[235:14.10]I don't know.
[235:14.88]What's he in?
[235:21.38]Each time you climbed the rope you caused her pain, but you always hurt the ones you love I went I saved I saved the girl Okay, is that all you required
[235:50.75]I want an explanation.
[235:54.57]Of course you do.
[235:56.59]There are no such things as monsters.
[235:59.95]And yet, you've killed monsters.
[236:03.58]Everything in Harvest is just slightly askew.
[236:07.82]This is because, as advanced as our technology is, we cannot make the Sim any better than this.
[236:17.05]The subject's subconscious always warps it in unpredictable ways.
[236:23.46]I'm in a computer simulation.
[236:28.87]Satan face.
[236:31.05]Sam?
[236:34.80]This is nothing more than a virtual reality designed by the harvesters to test potential members.
[236:44.71]Having successfully completed the program, you have earned the right to become a harvester.
[236:57.12]What the hell is a harvester?
[237:02.59]It was like a terrible like middle school poem
[237:28.39]This is how you become a serial killer.
[237:39.54]He's making it up as he goes.
[237:42.94]That's why he looks like that.
[237:44.24]Because he's like really concerned like... Oh shit.
[237:48.51]I hope he buys this.
[237:50.17]This is total bullshit.
[237:51.57]I hope he gets this though.
[237:55.51]You...
[237:56.59]Want me to become a serial killer?
[238:05.39]This entire reality has been engineered to break down your resistance, to desensitize you to violence.
[238:16.28]Now you may become a harvester and re-enter the real world or stay in peace with young Stephanie and spend the rest of your life in the construct known as Harvest.
[238:33.94]So I gotta get out of the Matrix.
[238:35.19]What is the real world at this point?
[238:40.93]You are suspended in a sensory deprivation tank, wired to a VR deck.
[238:47.71]If you don't join us, we will terminate your life support, and you will be dead within minutes.
[238:55.69]Those last minutes, however, will seem like a lifetime lived in harvest.
[239:01.88]You will marry Stephanie and die peacefully of old age.
[239:10.80]You're presuming a what?
[239:13.56]He is.
[239:15.08]Aside from you, she is the only real person in our office suspended in a tank, jacked in just as you are.
[239:27.77]I assume you'll want to spend time together.
[239:34.19]If I stay.
[239:37.89]Of course, having completed your ordeal, you may leave with her as you intended and enjoy your victory.
[239:49.34]If, on the other hand, you wish to join us, the cost of exiting the lodge is the same as the cost of entering the lodge, a skull and spinal cord.
[240:07.69]So she has to die.
[240:12.22]What?
[240:13.46]No.
[240:15.12]You couldn't kill me.
[240:18.94]These harvesters, they put people through this torture to give them a taste for killing.
[240:25.71]The way to beat them is to deny them.
[240:28.53]To live out your life here.
[240:33.98]What if this is a ploy though?
[240:35.70]What if she's a bad guy?
[240:36.77]Oh boy, this is getting really tight.
[240:38.29]This is getting really fucked up now.
[241:04.32]Her ploy to try to get me to stop is the same thing that my cat does when she wants to get fed.
[241:12.71]You're not very convincing.
[241:14.13]You're just putting your claws onto my arm.
[241:29.95]Which is the right one?
[241:30.61]Kill Stephanie.
[241:31.99]Marry Stephanie.
[241:33.77]Alright, so it looks like, alright, we're gonna... We're gonna kill Stephanie.
[241:39.25]We're gonna marry the guy, the fat guy that took his shirt off.
[241:45.37]And we're gonna fuck this guy.
[241:50.81]Please help me.
[241:52.46]Dave, don't do this, please.
[241:54.72]No.
[241:55.92]No, please, somebody help me.
[241:59.16]No.
[242:31.92]Why not?
[242:33.02]He'll kill him!
[242:34.46]I'm double-crossing him!
[242:55.15]Wow, that was neat.
[242:59.31]That was NEAT.
[243:01.81]Welcome to our order, brother.
[243:13.78]It's a double- double cross.
[243:18.94]You can't have a real car here.
[243:20.89]This is a fake car.
[243:23.07]Why can't you not have a real car pull up?
[243:24.87]Why does it have to be fake?
[243:26.31]Where are you going?
[243:31.44]What is he doing?
[243:33.00]Okay, I thought he was like doing a sex act.
[243:35.40]Nowhere at all.
[243:44.17]So this is how, this is how serial killers are made.
[243:47.25]Playing harvester.
[243:56.99]That thing?
[243:58.01]I looked at it the other day.
[243:59.30]The very thought.
[244:01.42]Breeding serial killers.
[244:02.98]It's disgusting.
[244:03.96]Now we're getting meta.
[244:05.58]It's cool.
[244:06.94]It's cool, ma.
[244:07.76]You'll rot your mind playing games like that.
[244:10.22]Don't you know people who watch violence become violent themselves?
[244:17.18]That's bullshit, mom.
[244:19.46]I'm gonna kill mom.
[244:21.80]No, it isn't.
[244:23.10]Why do you think they started cutting the violence out of those Roadrunner cartoons?
[244:28.52]Roadrunner cartoons?
[244:30.16]Roadrunner cartoons?
[244:31.26]Infinity!
[244:52.19]There's a big twist there, and he ate a finger.
[244:56.84]That's how that's the end of the game.
[244:59.14]Ah, the big, big reveal.
[245:01.46]This guy's eaten a finger.
[245:03.50]Roadrunner cartoons.
[245:05.30]What the fuck?
[245:05.94]That was the Roadrunner's finger.
[245:23.05]Oh, man.
[245:23.89]No wonder there's the violence out of those Roadrunner cartoons.
[245:28.20]Like, they were too violent to begin with.
[245:31.02]Wile E. Coyote just drops off a cliff, like, a dozen times a week.
[245:35.26]Like, every episode he falls off of a mountain.
[245:38.56]Wow.
[245:39.06]Oh, alright.
[245:43.99]Well, there it is.
[245:48.19]I guess I could, you know, here, let's see the other ending.
[245:51.09]I'm just curious how it works.
[245:53.52]Is this the last thing we did?
[245:57.19]Let's see what happens if you marry.
[246:02.83]Welcome to the inner sanctum.
[246:07.45]This guy is introduced and dispatched very quickly.
[246:11.60]As the leader of the cult, this guy should have definitely had way more, a bigger role to play.
[246:19.70]Okay, so we're gonna marry Stephanie.
[246:23.01]So when it cuts to the real life are you watching like Christian broadcasts?
[246:30.46]How does that work?
[246:51.92]He's- he's the guy that made- that marries you?
[246:54.78]I thought we were gonna forget everything and wake up and not have like the scary cult leader make us the, you know, the priest.
[247:10.24]There's the baby.
[247:10.98]Please don't have your eyes pop out again.
[247:19.72]They died two days later.
[247:26.12]Sorry, he's just lying on a massage table.
[247:28.20]What a waste.
[247:28.83]This kid could have been something.
[247:31.89]Never look back.
[247:33.69]We got two more to plug in.
[247:35.31]There's gotta be a better way to develop these serial killers.
[247:38.41]This is scientific.
[247:40.36]You want we should go back to the old way?
[247:42.96]What old way?
[247:44.32]Good breeding.
[247:46.90]What was the old way?
[247:47.64]What was the old way?
[247:55.32]That ending is way worse than the other one.
[247:57.74]So, I'm glad we did the other one first.
[247:59.40]Oh, there it is.
[248:03.98]There's Harvester.
[248:04.88]Harvester is done.
[248:14.71]And, let's see here.
[248:17.15]We're going for over four hours now.
[248:19.30]I did not think this was going to take this long.
[248:22.55]I thought this was going to be like 30 minutes or 40 minutes.
[248:28.79]So I think that's like what we're doing tonight was this.
[248:33.65]Both endings sucked.
[248:34.53]Both endings.
[248:35.35]Well, I mean, remember, this is the early days of video games on the computer.
[248:42.25]There you go.
[248:42.85]Harvester's done.
[248:44.75]I would probably... That was worth playing.
[248:50.65]It was.
[248:57.02]I enjoyed my time in it, except for the parts with, like, all, like, the bad deaths.
[249:02.45]That's what the whole game is for.
[249:03.45]What am I talking about?
[249:04.23]Oh, no, I liked it except for when the people died.
[249:06.13]I didn't like that very much.
[249:07.71]I much rather when people live.
[249:09.95]I would have married Stephanie in that fucking shithole.
[249:13.98]Anyways, um... Let's raise this a little.
[249:20.96]Peggle to... No, I think that's gonna be it for tonight.
[249:23.64]That's gonna do it for tonight.
[249:25.39]Condemned 2, I did get a... I have a PlayStation 3 controller now, so Condemned 2 is going to be on schedule.
[249:34.66]I didn't kill the blind guy.
[249:35.68]No, I did not.
[249:37.14]I love how I have this here, by the way.
[249:41.82]So much for Condemned 2 tonight.
[249:43.14]I know, I really blew that one.
[249:47.19]But it's a good stopping point.
[249:49.23]That's pretty much it.
[249:53.15]Thursday we're gonna do Condemned 2.
[249:57.58]Condemned 2 is probably gonna take us into Friday, I would assume.
[250:00.48]So Friday and Thursday will be Condemned 2.
[250:04.48]And if it has to be cleaned up a little bit on Saturday, I will do a stream on Saturday to finish Condemned 2.
[250:10.22]When is Jerma Rumble 2018?
[250:11.00]We just had a 2017 like a month or two ago.
[250:21.52]Is there still glitter on the floor?
[250:22.68]Not really.
[250:23.40]I mean, there's like dust and shit.
[250:27.18]I don't want to turn around.
[250:28.99]I don't want to see how dirty the back of my hair is.
[250:32.65]But anyways, let's get to the out screen.
[250:36.87]I'm going to go over the bits that I missed from earlier and into right now.
[250:46.96]Dead Rising 1 is a fantastic game.
[250:51.08]Unfortunately, I don't know if I... Maybe I would stream it.
[250:59.82]That would be a fun stream, I think.
[251:03.72]So, anywho, we're going to go back to the beginning of the stream.
[251:09.95]If you stuck around just for Harvester, thank you so much for hanging out.
[251:15.43]See you on Thursday, so we can properly start Condemned 2.
[251:19.86]Take care.
[251:20.72]Have a good rest of your evening.
[251:23.67]And let's get started with the bits from earlier this evening.
[251:29.53]Uh, Stix!
[251:30.31]Thank you, Stix, again.
[251:31.49]StixRenegade gave $5.
[251:32.81]They said, uh, have to miss this one, Jerma.
[251:37.37]Uh, Michael from Vsauce and Adam Savage from Mythbusters are in Providence for Brain Candy Live.
[251:45.99]So excited to see you.
[251:46.94]Well, that sounds fun.
[251:49.11]Adam Savage, that's the Mythbusters.
[251:50.77]Yeah, you just said it.
[251:52.23]Oh, that's the Mythbusters guy, right?
[251:53.91]You literally just told me that.
[251:57.93]Fucking idiot.
[251:59.93]I must be the dumbest person alive.
[252:01.82]I just read it out loud.
[252:04.40]But thank you, Styx, if you are watching the vlog later.
[252:09.04]And Edgemont gave $50 right now.
[252:11.34]We're going to get to that in a minute.
[252:12.24]We're going to get to that in a minute.
[252:15.84]What did you say?
[252:17.34]That was a pretty funny playthrough.
[252:18.50]There were a lot of fails, lots of triumphs.
[252:20.74]Glad you played Harvester.
[252:22.06]It was quite enjoyable.
[252:23.05]Love ya.
[252:24.15]Well, love you too, son.
[252:27.43]Thank you for the $50.
[252:30.05]Thank you for the... In total tonight, you've given more than $100, I think.
[252:34.48]That is a $100 evening plus for you, Edgemont.
[252:37.96]Thank you so much.
[252:40.90]Incredibly kind of you.
[252:43.73]Let's go back to... Earlier here we had... Bunnies!
[252:52.92]Bunnies gave $49 earlier, and I somehow missed it.
[252:58.04]Hopefully you're still here, Bunnies.
[253:00.50]They say stream hype.
[253:03.04]Hopefully you enjoyed yourself.
[253:06.00]Thank you so much for the nearly $50, though.
[253:07.68]That's very, very, very, very much, lots of much money.
[253:14.22]Sly JermaCraft reference.
[253:16.54]I feel like that's going to pop up everywhere, and I'll end up reading it out loud.
[253:22.66]You know, you guys always focus on the first episode of JermaCraft.
[253:26.94]You do realize there are like 15 episodes of that.
[253:31.10]There's probably so much more cringy shit material in those videos, those like 12 to 15 videos, that you guys focus on that first one.
[253:41.77]But bunnies, thanks again for the $49.
[253:43.59]Snarklepuss, thanks for the $1.
[253:44.95]AquaFox, thanks for $3.
[253:48.19]Jerma, you're my favorite person ever.
[253:49.38]I've been watching you for years.
[253:51.02]You have a special habit for the past month with a cancer scare.
[253:53.08]That was from earlier.
[253:53.72]That was AquaFox.
[253:57.16]We wish you the best, man.
[253:59.40]Like, I don't know if you're still here, Aqua, but if that is the case, take care of yourself, because that's scary shit.
[254:10.35]Also...
[254:14.59]Han314 gave $5.
[254:18.03]Are you going to PAX East 2018?
[254:20.06]Yes.
[254:21.04]I will be at pretty much every single PAX East.
[254:24.68]Because it's very close, so.
[254:27.20]It's not far at all, so I would be at every single one.
[254:31.11]Stixx again gave $4.
[254:32.93]Missed my bits?
[254:33.79]Nah, it's okay.
