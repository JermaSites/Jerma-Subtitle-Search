[00:01.34]well hello welcome to christmas eve god darn it oh yeah yeah that was an ordeal uh italics and I have been uh painstakingly trying to get this ready for the last probably about three and a half hours we had some issues but the issues have been fixed I think I hope so and we're ready to have a christmas eve party
[00:30.56]Happy Christmas Eve, everybody.
[00:34.52]How the heck are you?
[00:35.64]Hope you're having a great day.
[00:39.08]Conductor drummer is on the case, as you see.
[00:41.92]Got my costume on.
[00:42.96]I've got my... Forget about the branding on that thing.
[00:47.23]I was going to cover it up before the stream started, but I didn't somehow.
[00:51.15]I got a nice tree.
[00:52.11]I've got my nice brick backdrop here.
[00:53.83]Plenty of presents under the tree here.
[00:58.46]uh where that was picked by you guys uh in the mods too welcome to christmas eve uh yeah sure I started like an hour and a half late typically I would love to have started an hour ago but uh camera broke we had some lighting issues I had some obs issues but you know whatever it's christmas eve merry christmas happy holidays how are you so let's break down what we're gonna do
[01:24.80]Over here, you're probably wondering why the fuck there's a printer here.
[01:28.42]This is the extreme magic fax machine.
[01:32.38]So anytime that you want to send me a message or want to talk to me, you're going to use your magical fucking computer and I'll get it somehow through a bit donation.
[01:41.69]Hopefully it works.
[01:44.55]I hope it's hooked up correctly because there should be messages from the fucking people coming out here.
[01:50.61]And if there's not, then we'll have to fucking unplug and plug it back in.
[01:54.33]Presence over here, tree over here.
[01:55.59]I got a train set ready to build.
[01:58.82]Oh, Jeremy, you look like a fucking dickhead.
[02:00.80]Well, you know what?
[02:02.24]Sometimes you look like a dickhead.
[02:05.20]Oh my God.
[02:12.56]Okay, so my fucking fly was undone in the very beginning.
[02:17.54]That's a fantastic start.
[02:20.42]Why don't we move over to the train set, because I'm in the conductor route, we might as well do it here.
[02:25.02]Welcome to the screen, everybody.
[02:32.53]So I gotta, I can't fucking believe my fly was undone.
[02:38.57]Did you see my fly undone?
[02:41.11]Hey, you, tell us.
[02:42.67]Was my fly, did you see my fly undone?
[02:47.08]Is my fly actually on the... Why did you not tell me that?
[02:53.06]He's fucking over there being a director.
[02:56.72]All right, so hey, Choo Choo, what do you say here?
[02:58.65]We got our train set here.
[03:01.05]I figured it'd be a fun start.
[03:02.09]The first part of the stream should be about building and creating.
[03:07.27]So I have... This is gonna be fucking ridiculous.
[03:14.33]Here is the train that I have.
[03:17.13]We're going to build a train set on spring.
[03:20.81]And this is kind of going to be a present that I'm going to give to probably a local library, I would assume.
[03:29.85]I'm going to probably donate this to a library because what the fuck am I going to do with this after the spring is over?
[03:34.94]I have no idea.
[03:36.70]So let's get started.
[03:38.42]Here, it's called the South Pacific Train.
[03:40.82]It looks like you keep in score.
[03:43.46]Can you see this shit?
[03:46.25]Does this look good?
[03:48.00]So I got pieces here.
[03:48.90]I got straights, I got curves, and I kind of don't know what to do.
[03:56.44]I'm thinking like a figure eight.
[03:59.70]This moves, by the way.
[04:02.01]If you're like, oh, Jeremy, it doesn't move.
[04:04.35]It does.
[04:04.99]I gotta move the fucking mic.
[04:06.87]Hold on.
[04:15.42]That right right there looks damn good.
[04:19.10]Good?
[04:19.30]Can you hear me?
[04:24.31]Is my fucking fly up?
[04:26.53]Jesus Christ.
[04:27.75]Okay.
[04:28.71]Hey, Merry Christmas, by the way, everybody.
[04:30.82]How the heck are you?
[04:32.82]Don't, uh.
[04:38.88]Within 10 seconds.
[04:45.58]I'm going to say, if we start, because this is a real train, like I said, it's going to move in various directions.
[04:54.60]I need the plug to go in here, though.
[04:55.86]The plug has to go in here, because this is a real fucking train, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:03.17]So we have to start.
[05:04.11]I don't want to break this.
[05:08.25]This is going to a library, goddammit.
[05:17.74]Just get the fuck over here.
[05:21.42]Right here.
[05:22.12]I gotta plug it in.
[05:23.02]Am I gonna get electrocuted if I do this?
[05:30.87]Okay.
[05:31.95]I did not get electrocuted.
[05:47.50]Is that an error message?
[05:48.42]I don't know if that's an error message.
[05:50.22]All right, shut the fuck up.
[05:51.68]Let's get one of these on here.
[05:56.49]All right, you got to match the fucking lines up here, folks.
[06:04.73]I got to get like a bird's eye view.
[06:10.02]Because I'm thinking, great.
[06:14.18]And what a goddamn train this is.
[06:17.31]Straight and then around, and then maybe straight and around again.
[06:25.69]Yes, I'm aware that I look like a total fucking dickhead.
[06:28.08]I'm aware of that.
[06:30.68]Let's go like this.
[06:36.10]Here we go, right here.
[06:42.96]So these trains,
[06:55.13]There we go.
[06:56.57]Okay, that's in.
[07:01.34]So should I do like some tricks?
[07:06.82]I'm thinking like at least two loops.
[07:11.48]Let's block it out.
[07:12.16]So if I go like that, that's a huge U.
[07:21.54]But I gotta make sure I can actually get off of me.
[07:24.53]I gotta make sure I can actually connect it.
[07:30.13]No, that can't go there.
[07:32.63]I'll be amazed if this actually works.
[07:34.79]I can one loop around and then maybe straight and then around again.
[07:39.49]There we go.
[07:43.54]That looks better.
[07:47.02]Hope you're enjoying your holiday here, everybody.
[08:09.37]This looks like it can go across and then through this way too, right?
[08:17.89]But that's not a figure eight.
[08:22.70]Close enough.
[08:24.02]Maybe I should have wrote this down.
[08:25.16]Because right now it's going to be like a loop and then another, hold on, how dark can it be a loop?
[08:40.57]I don't think I can get it to work.
[08:41.57]Because if I go like that, I guess maybe it could go around in another circle and then through here.
[08:48.77]Let's see what it looks like.
[09:01.64]One more.
[09:08.50]That's going to look actually really cool.
[09:11.78]One.
[09:15.37]Oh, will this work?
[09:21.15]Fuck, that's not gonna do anything.
[09:22.57]Put it down.
[09:34.79]That's not gonna work.
[09:36.53]What if I, hold on.
[09:38.51]So through here and then
[09:42.84]How am I supposed to get this to go this way?
[09:53.52]You know what I'm saying?
[09:54.08]Like, how am I supposed to get this to go all the way around?
[09:57.78]Is it even possible?
[10:05.91]This segment was supposed to be about 20 minutes!
[10:10.41]Don't think that's gonna be the case anymore.
[10:36.39]If I go out from here, don't worry.
[10:41.23]You'll ride on the train in a second.
[10:42.57]We'll get it to work.
[10:44.59]I'm going to say like this and then like that.
[10:48.95]I don't care that much about how cool it looks.
[10:51.03]You know what I mean?
[10:51.67]I care about it working.
[10:53.74]That's all I give a shit about.
[11:01.14]So then we're going to fuck this all.
[11:08.90]Don't break it.
[11:18.33]Don't break it.
[11:20.09]I'm going to break it.
[11:21.07]I don't want to.
[11:21.55]That's the problem here.
[11:36.24]Get in there.
[11:36.88]Come on.
[11:38.36]come on I got a stream to run somebody is probably telling me jeremy you should probably put some jumps in there and put some obstacles in there yeah I can't even get the whole thing built before that I was gonna have like
[12:08.78]Trees and shit to go around.
[12:10.18]Why is this not going in?
[12:12.46]What have I done that's wrong?
[12:18.14]Get the fuck in there.
[12:19.37]Alright, it's in.
[12:21.63]Got it.
[12:25.89]Alright, finally.
[12:26.91]Oh god.
[12:27.41]Alright, connect this.
[12:28.13]It's supposed to be easy assembly.
[12:32.19]My ass.
[12:32.63]That one went in much easier than the other one.
[12:40.88]All right, so here we go.
[12:41.82]So starting here, right around.
[12:44.30]This thing makes noise and shit too, guys.
[12:45.92]This way.
[12:50.63]So then, let's get a straight track.
[12:52.71]Straight ahead.
[12:58.13]I'm gonna lap my ass off if I build this whole thing and it just doesn't work at all.
[13:05.24]I spend all the time doing this.
[13:08.46]And then turn it on and it just fucking sits still.
[13:12.34]Oh, get your fucking frog champs.
[13:14.01]Ow!
[13:14.15]What the?
[13:14.85]Ow!
[13:15.51]Seriously, that fucking hurt.
[13:18.63]This is designed for like 11-year-olds.
[13:20.43]How did I just hurt myself?
[13:21.57]All right, get in there.
[13:30.01]Okay.
[13:31.21]No, that's not in there, right?
[13:33.53]Oh, you motherfucker, get in there.
[13:42.03]Bent.
[13:43.03]How did I bend it already?
[13:44.33]Oh, you motherfucker.
[13:55.54]Other side.
[14:00.76]So when I was looking at the box, this thing looks actually really fucking cool.
[14:06.29]It makes noise.
[14:08.57]It has smoke that I'm not going to use.
[14:12.86]What am I doing?
[14:17.04]All right, no, no, no, no, that's good, that's good, that's good, that's fine.
[14:21.92]Go this way.
[14:22.48]Like this.
[14:30.86]All right, do it again.
[14:32.46]I'll be fucking surprised.
[14:37.19]Okay, that's good.
[14:40.15]How does it look so far?
[14:42.47]What are they saying?
[14:42.97]Anything bad?
[14:45.45]Hold on, he just went like this.
[14:57.86]He just went like this.
[15:03.46]What, you don't like this?
[15:05.62]You don't think this is cool?
[15:09.81]I got a train set, goddammit.
[15:15.63]He just goes like this.
[15:17.99]All right, fine.
[15:18.79]Let's build a fucking train.
[15:23.94]Just wait till I turn this thing on.
[15:25.26]And that was a horrible voice crack, but Dutch does it, so it's okay.
[15:33.07]Dutch made the voice crack cool again.
[15:35.11]Like, made it, like, okay to do it.
[15:41.96]I hated the train segment.
[15:44.12]That was the worst part of the Christmas Eve stream.
[15:46.69]I fucked that whole segment.
[15:51.83]What, he built a train on stream?
[15:53.92]I hope he fucking pees his pants.
[15:56.74]Oh!
[16:13.51]This is just part one of the night, okay?
[16:15.61]So just relax.
[16:17.67]Around the circle, and then it's gotta go this way.
[16:19.89]How the fuck am I gonna get it to go that way?
[16:22.49]Like this?
[16:37.56]All right, I gotta check this out.
[16:38.98]Watch this, ready?
[16:40.36]Bang.
[16:44.54]What if this is the whole stream?
[16:47.92]I just baited you guys so hard.
[16:49.26]It's just me building a fucking train set.
[16:53.38]We're gonna fucking 40,000 people.
[16:55.45]All right, so... Is that gonna work?
[17:04.63]Oh my god, it's not gonna work.
[17:09.72]No, this is not gonna do anything.
[17:15.85]Plug it in.
[17:16.21]Let me see.
[17:16.99]I want to see.
[17:21.05]I just want to make sure the thing works.
[17:45.68]Here we go.
[17:46.10]Ready?
[17:53.35]Wait.
[17:57.59]Oh, this is stupid, Jeremy.
[17:59.19]God damn it.
[18:03.57]I need to see if it goes...
[18:33.03]Oh yeah, pump tip!
[18:35.77]Oh, this is bad.
[18:40.00]Turn the fucking thing off.
[18:49.66]I need to get like a closed loop.
[19:04.47]I can't even get it closed.
[19:06.37]I screwed the whole thing up.
[19:08.55]I mean, no, because this has to come off.
[19:14.03]Oh, God.
[19:15.91]How am I going to do that?
[19:27.75]Yes.
[19:28.13]Like that?
[19:30.81]Oh, baby boy!
[19:34.74]He figured it out.
[19:40.64]Take a look at this shit.
[19:42.10]Oh, Jeremy, this is the worst thing you've ever done on stream.
[19:44.44]Oh yeah, has it?
[19:45.62]You didn't fucking watch this part.
[19:51.99]Oh!
[19:57.13]Look at that.
[19:58.01]Okay, close.
[20:00.73]Get this connected again.
[20:14.38]Around here, around, through, and then around.
[20:21.38]Stomp it, stomp it, Jeremy, stomp the train.
[20:23.42]No, not, why?
[20:24.58]Please, give it a rest.
[20:32.86]Every little bit needs to be, okay.
[20:37.86]All right, then around this way.
[20:50.32]Come on, I know you can do it.
[20:54.98]Round, and then close it.
[20:57.74]And then if we can get a full loop, I'll be happy.
[21:00.88]This thing is fucking cool.
[21:04.00]I might just be saying that because everyone's fucking talking about how this is the worst thing ever.
[21:08.67]No, they're not.
[21:10.77]But I can't sing, you know what I mean?
[21:25.03]Doesn't look bad.
[21:27.29]As long as these things are actually connected well, and they are.
[21:30.89]So I need to connect it here.
[21:37.81]And that's a full loop and we're going full blast.
[22:10.83]Some library is going to get this, a local library, and they're going to make some cool display, and it's going to be fucking awesome.
[22:17.99]I'm just testing the goddamn thing, okay?
[22:27.30]Once you see it go around the whole track, I think your mind will change.
[22:30.02]All right.
[22:40.83]Kind of making like a reverse squid.
[22:42.17]Am I going to have enough track to do this?
[22:48.02]I don't think I have enough track to do it.
[22:49.24]This is bad.
[22:51.18]Let's see.
[23:01.99]Right there.
[23:02.51]Connect it.
[23:07.79]Oh, don't break anything.
[23:15.24]I don't have enough pieces to complete this.
[23:18.42]Really?
[23:18.80]One.
[23:22.13]Two.
[23:24.11]Oh, fucking hell.
[23:25.29]Come on, really?
[23:26.07]How do I not have enough pieces to do this?
[23:45.67]um I guess I could what can I do about this I don't know take from here um
[24:13.93]Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[24:20.02]I use too many curves.
[24:29.34]I need a complete circuit before we move on, don't you understand?
[24:32.28]All right, that looks all right.
[24:47.71]That's one that goes up here and around.
[24:50.29]And then... Shit, let me test it.
[25:00.83]Is that good?
[25:13.56]What happened?
[25:15.66]What happened?
[25:16.80]What?
[25:18.34]What's the fucking problem?
[26:04.17]I think that's good enough.
[26:10.72]I think that's great.
[26:12.00]That looked really fun.
[26:24.47]Wait, were you playing Thomas the Tank?
[26:29.09]Are you fucking kidding me?
[26:38.47]Oh my God.
[26:43.25]I need a complete loop.
[26:44.99]Just get this.
[26:46.23]I fucked the whole thing up.
[26:48.72]I made a pretzel.
[26:49.72]I was supposed to make a figure eight.
[26:51.78]How did I screw?
[26:52.42]There are no pieces?
[26:58.93]I need to go around the circle once.
[27:02.41]Just wait, hold on.
[27:07.31]Get rid of this piece.
[27:08.39]I got it, I figured it out, just wait.
[27:14.63]Speed run, here we go.
[27:41.29]Got it, watch this shit, here we go.
[27:47.70]Ah, get it on there.
[27:51.98]I'm the best, I'm the greatest.
[27:56.80]Don't break this, this is going to a library.
[28:11.19]How are you supposed to do this?
[28:49.74]Close.
[28:51.02]I just want, I need this piece.
[28:53.22]I need the fucking piece that has power.
[28:54.72]Get out of here for a second.
[29:03.68]Almost.
[29:04.00]Do I not understand?
[29:24.28]Merry fucking Christmas.
[29:34.00]Got it?
[29:34.96]Got it.
[29:53.10]Oh, fuck, yeah.
[29:55.80]We've got a complete loop.
[30:06.93]Oh, baby, would you look at that?
[30:08.71]Get it on here.
[30:09.87]Where's the plug?
[30:13.46]I just need a circle and...
[30:24.25]It's on the right.
[30:25.07]Try to do something fancy and you fuck it all up.
[30:30.87]All right.
[30:31.19]I think that's good.
[30:35.27]Get out of the way.
[30:35.83]I want a good view of this.
[30:49.58]Okay.
[30:50.88]You ready for the complete loop?
[31:02.02]Here we go.
[31:10.73]Here we go.
[31:11.23]Do it!
[31:41.08]Thanks for coming to the stream, everybody.
[31:42.77]That's it.
[31:46.13]No, you know what?
[31:46.77]Fuck it.
[31:47.09]Let's get on this thing.
[31:48.87]You want to get on this train?
[31:50.83]It's a complete loop.
[31:51.60]Let's get on the fucking train.
[31:53.08]See?
[31:53.22]Let's get on it.
[31:54.32]Let me get in.
[31:56.72]Let me get on that train.
[32:57.14]Thank you.
[33:56.90]Thank you.
[34:51.40]Oh!
[34:52.06]Oh, what's that?
[34:52.54]Oh, whoops!
[34:53.40]Oh, whoopsie!
[34:54.28]Oh, whoopsie!
[34:55.24]Oh, what's that?
[35:04.21]Oh, where would you live?
[35:05.57]Sorry, I took over the... Oh, let me get my napkin there.
[35:10.67]Sorry, I took over the stream channel.
[35:13.11]Oh, what's that?
[35:14.09]Oh, it's a daisy.
[35:16.86]Well, then, happy Halloween, you fucking idiots!

[36:38.88]of my dark magic book that you'll be very, very fond of.
[36:45.65]Not with one of my favorites.
[36:48.85]Oh, it's Christmas time, though, Evilberry.
[36:50.69]What kind of Christmas stories will we be getting?
[36:54.96]My first tale is called Carol Singers.
[37:03.42]From a collection of horrible fucking deeds
[37:08.75]Town Singers is a scary story for Christmas about a kid whose father and grandfather go from door to door begging for money.
[37:20.78]It is based on an old horror story by Bernard Koops of The Vanishing House.
[37:30.86]Go!
[37:35.27]You know, my grandfather was a drunk, and my father was a drunk.
[37:40.61]But I never touched a drunk.
[37:43.35]There's a reason for that.
[37:46.32]When I was young, times were hard, and I grew up poor.
[37:51.40]My grandfather and my father never did an honest day's work in their lives.
[37:57.80]Granddad wasn't good for much, but he played the clarinet like an artist.
[38:05.97]He taught my father how to play the accordion.
[38:09.97]This is upside down.
[38:12.89]Imagine a book of fucking spells.
[38:17.04]Sure did cause a little bit of an issue.
[38:31.63]Every single Christmas,
[38:35.35]They would gather a group of friends and go door to door, playing Christmas music, singing Christmas carols and begging for money.
[38:46.62]Afterwards, they would all go down to the pub and spend it on alcohol.
[38:52.30]No!
[38:53.48]Don't do that!
[38:55.66]On Christmas Eve, they brought me with them.
[39:00.14]I was too young to play an instrument, so they handed me a triangle and told me to strike it every now and then.
[39:08.01]It's what I was capable of doing.
[39:11.93]The night was dark, the snow was falling, and cold December wind cut through us like a knife.
[39:20.94]We kept our heads down and trudged through the snow in sleet.
[39:26.28]Eventually, my grandfather stopped and said, this looks like a pretty good place to stay.
[39:32.76]We were outside a big mansion decorated with Christmas lights.
[39:39.86]My grandfather knocked on the front door and began to play some old Christmas cards.
[39:48.97]The door of the house swung open.
[39:53.44]And in the dim light, I saw a young woman standing there.
[39:58.58]She was holding a tray of glasses in her hand.
[40:11.65]With a smile, she picked up a glass and held it out, inviting one of the men to drink.
[40:20.96]My granddad,
[40:33.07]Just then I looked up and in the window above, I saw a face peering out of the shadow.
[40:43.61]A face that was hideous beyond words.
[40:46.43]I looked back at the woman in the doorway and her face was hideous too.
[40:54.16]Before I could stop her, my grandfather put the glass to his lips and knocked it back with one big gulp.
[41:04.35]Oh, dear, said the woman in an eerie, childish voice.
[41:07.83]Oh, you've drunk blood, sir.
[41:17.06]With that, the door slammed shut.
[41:20.18]My grandfather stumbled backwards and the grass fell from his hand.
[41:26.06]It's such a devastating crash.
[41:31.09]And he collapsed.
[41:38.26]I don't remember much after that.
[41:41.94]All I recall is waking up in the lights of dawn and finding myself lying in the snow.
[41:49.99]The other men were lying all around me, just waking up themselves.
[41:57.25]My father got to his feet and rubbed his head.
[42:02.16]The woman had disappeared and the house was boarded up and abandoned.
[42:07.49]All that was left was a dark red stain in the snow with a glass that broke.
[42:16.51]My grandfather lay there in the snow beside it, his face purple and swollen.
[42:21.97]Dead as the dawn had come.
[42:35.52]We hurried home that morning and called the police.
[42:39.05]They picked up my grandfather's body and brought it to the mortuary.
[42:44.29]My father told them what happened, but they didn't believe a word of his tale.
[42:50.27]They said the house had been vacant for a hundred years!
[42:56.44]One hundred!
[43:00.88]After that night, my father was never the same again.
[43:10.98]They shall arrive in day.
[43:14.64]And that is the story of the Christmas Carol.
[43:23.64]Two points!
[43:27.08]This next tale is the same one.
[43:34.82]This next tale is called Vigil Ritho.
[43:44.08]wondering I didn't get my halloween stream so of course I'm going to show up here three months later and get what I was supposed to get which is a string for halloween oh but it's christmas time it's christmas time that's all I hear is that the greater I like this one
[44:15.36]doing those.
[44:17.02]They're a lot of fun.
[44:20.88]The Grither is a scary story about a legendary monster who lives in the icy wastes of the North Pole.
[44:51.21]I have to put it on the right way.
[44:57.29]Are you ready?
[45:02.19]It was Christmas Eve and the family were gathered in the living room.
[45:15.84]I see.
[45:16.24]There's that.
[45:32.89]The family was gathered in the living room.
[45:40.22]The father was reading the newspaper and the mother was knitting a sweater.
[45:45.88]The children, Jimbo and Steffo, were stretched out on the floor with their crayons and their coloring books.
[45:53.64]Tell us a story, Steffo demanded.
[45:58.19]Yes, a scary one, Jimbo insisted.
[46:04.91]All right, all right, said their father.
[46:08.16]I'm going to tell you about the fearsome, dangerous, and appalling creature in the world.
[46:13.12]It's called the Grither.
[46:19.00]Oh, now you've done it, said the mother.
[46:23.57]You've said his name out loud like Voldemort.
[46:30.33]Where is he?
[46:31.25]said Jimbo.
[46:32.94]He's the most awful thing in the world.
[46:35.94]He lives in a cave in the North Pole.
[46:38.16]The coldest, wettest place on Earth is where the griffin makes his home.
[46:43.64]He sleeps in the wreck of a ship that somehow got squeezed into the mouth of a cave.
[46:49.78]He doesn't mind the cold and doesn't mind the wet.
[46:55.02]But the thing he hates the most
[47:00.00]Hear someone say his name.
[47:05.28]He was very good and he has very good ears.
[47:10.06]And they get bigger every time his name is spoken.
[47:15.85]Anywhere on earth.
[47:18.85]Sometimes his ears get so big he can use them to fly.
[47:22.97]He can fly away with his ears.
[47:32.70]Too late now, her mother said.
[47:36.18]If we finish the story before he gets here, everything will be fine.
[47:40.00]Do you know why the Grither is called the Grither?
[47:46.03]Why, said the children, because he has fists as big as basketballs and his arms as long as ball constrictors.
[47:55.67]Whenever he finds the people who have been speaking his name,
[48:02.37]and grithers them.
[48:10.79]He squeezes them by the head and squeezes their head until it pops.
[48:18.80]Just like a balloon.
[48:26.30]And does he look like a think foot?
[48:29.57]Yeah, about that.
[48:32.19]No, said his father.
[48:35.57]He's not like Bigfoot and he's not like the abominable snowman either.
[48:42.08]Nobody knows what he looks like for sure.
[48:44.22]The only people who have ever seen the grither are the people the grither has eaten.
[48:50.30]It's gonna be you.
[48:54.70]I love you.
[48:57.61]He's as tall as a tree and can bend all the way over and touch the ground.
[49:04.29]His skin looks like a road map because it's transparent and all the blue and red veins show through.
[49:13.32]The blue is for the fear and the red is for the rage.
[49:24.59]And hurry up and finish the story before he gets here, Steffel cried.
[49:49.01]Well, the grither was born on a sailing ship, said her father.
[49:53.82]It was blown off course by a storm and got lost in the Arctic Sea.
[49:59.79]They drifted around for weeks and never saw anything but glaciers and icebergs.
[50:06.93]Some of the passengers drowned, some froze to death, some starved, and the rest committed suicide.
[50:16.05]MacGrither was born out of the fear and rage of all those people.
[50:22.17]But why does he kill people?
[50:24.21]Kimpo asked.
[50:26.15]Nobody knows.
[50:28.43]Nobody knows, said his father.
[50:30.91]He just doesn't like anyone telling his story.
[50:36.05]Is that all?
[50:36.93]Steffa asked.
[50:38.01]Is that the end of the story?
[50:40.77]Well, not quite.
[50:43.70]Not quite, said her father.
[50:46.50]There's only one way to protect yourself from the Gritha.
[50:50.36]Only one way.
[50:55.75]Maybe you should stop, said the mother and interrupted.
[51:00.95]I don't, I think, I think you've scared them enough for tonight.
[51:08.28]You don't actually believe this story, said the father.
[51:13.46]No, the children lied.
[51:16.02]Well, you shouldn't, because I made it all up.
[51:20.73]I made the whole story up.
[51:24.04]Oh, said the father, there's no such thing as the grither.
[51:27.58]It's not real.
[51:29.58]Oh, why didn't you finish the story, said Steffa.
[51:34.25]All of the sudden, the front door blew open and the room was enveloped in an icy blast of wind.
[51:40.53]There was a crash and the sound of breaking glass.
[51:43.49]Then the two huge, narrowed arms reached in through the windows and grasped their parents by the head as the children watched in horror.
[51:55.31]The hands squeezed and squeezed their parents' fucking heads until they exploded.
[52:09.44]Like a balloon.
[53:01.85]One of our final tales of the evening.
[53:04.01]Hey, could I like... Could I use your printer?
[53:15.61]This didn't print out really the way that I wanted it to.
[53:18.50]If you print me out another copy, I don't know what this is here for.
[53:22.66]Doesn't work.
[53:27.56]Made by HP.
[53:28.58]Are you sure I can't
[53:39.04]It's okay, I'll just... And just tell Jeremy that after the show, that my $40 for my usable fee.
[53:55.14]Okay?
[53:57.04]I can't use that.
[53:59.68]No.
[53:59.74]Is this how it works?
[54:09.55]Print me out another, I have a file that I put on his computer.
[54:13.95]I don't know if he has it or not, but.
[54:21.40]This next tale is, I think I got it from Reddit.
[54:27.02]This is a terrifying tale.
[54:31.52]A horror tale.
[54:34.94]A Christmas horror story.
[54:39.58]A few years back, I went to my dad's house for Christmas.
[54:45.10]My parents are divorced and I rarely go, but my siblings put a lot of pressure on me, so I went.
[54:55.05]It took about 15 minutes before the stress got to me and I got a migraine.
[55:02.44]So we all sit down to open presents.
[55:05.06]Dad, his new wife, my siblings, Fraisian, and my grandmother.
[55:10.57]We make it around the circle opening presents for about two rounds before my grandmother gets up and leaves the room.
[55:20.04]My father starts fiddling around waiting for my grandmother to come back and spots something on the floor.
[55:34.18]He asked his wife if it is indeed cat puke.
[55:38.94]She had gotten up and followed my grandmother out and knew the truth.
[55:44.20]It was not cat puke.
[55:46.24]It was my grandmother's shit.
[55:49.98]And the lady had shit all over the couch.
[55:54.60]It doesn't take long before he can smell the shit.
[55:57.78]And no amount of air freshener was fixing that.
[56:02.42]Grandma comes back into the room now, wearing nothing but a blanket around her lower half.
[56:09.00]The couch is covered with plastic and towels.
[56:14.44]My little sister is forced to sit next to my grandmother, and we are all expected to sit nicely and open more presents while pretending that my grandmother had not just shit all over the couch.
[56:30.92]Also, the following day, my tooth exploded.
[56:34.62]Apparently, I had an abscess, but I never felt a thing until it exploded.
[56:40.69]T-L-D-R.
[56:43.73]Grandma shit on the couch.
[56:46.59]What a horrifying story.
[56:48.85]What a terrifying tale.
[57:04.87]I have one more tale for you.
[57:08.81]This tale is a very recent one.
[57:14.89]It came up
[57:32.93]The final tale is a recent tale that I came across in my travels and I found it to be so bone-chilling, so absolutely disgraceful and horrible for warning to you all watching.
[57:49.54]This last tale will chill you to your very soul.
[58:00.61]This tale is called
[58:06.17]of yesteryear.
[58:15.77]Put the magic in there.
[58:18.73]There's magic in there.
[58:21.81]The sins of yesteryear.
[58:23.70]The winds blow cold this time of year.
[58:36.30]the snowy, icy-filled days are partly to blame.
[58:41.17]And seeing your hot breath turn to condensed clouds of cold silk, while your toes turn to numb rubbers not under the ordinary.
[58:50.28]But that is not the spine-chilling freeze.
[59:02.03]On a breezy before Christmas day, I took an evening jog around the neighborhood.
[59:08.05]I used to do track and field in high school and liked staying active.
[59:13.79]So I was usually running or walking everywhere.
[59:18.21]The route I would typically lead took me to a few side streets and neighborhoods.
[59:29.80]What?
[59:31.85]Am I supposed to read these?
[59:33.75]What is this?
[59:40.74]When I was like 11, I really wanted to be an iPod for Halloween.
[59:46.10]So my dad made me a foam rubber iPod costume complete with speaker mounts.
[60:02.43]No one wants to be an iPod anymore.
[60:44.28]It's a little humorous, I will say.
[60:48.16]On a breezy before Christmas Day, you know the story.
[60:52.08]It was cold and he got jogging.
[60:54.74]He's a jogger.
[60:55.70]He likes to run.
[60:57.20]He likes to move around.
[60:58.96]Okay, sorry.
[61:06.75]I'm a major creature of habit.
[61:12.15]But for some very odd reason...
[61:19.92]I strayed away from my normal routine.
[61:25.10]And it will haunt me until my final day.
[61:28.79]I had always heard stories about this person called the Loud Man.
[61:37.05]It was an urban legend in our city, and the story is told differently from person to person.
[61:43.66]It became a sort of running joke among all of us.
[61:48.64]loud laughing noises and sometimes faint screams coming from a certain house which is what made it so strange what were these noises and who was making them I was never afraid of urban legends and always scoffed at the idea of a boogeyman or a bigfoot among us
[62:15.76]Ooh, hiding in plain sight, waiting for the right time to drain us of our souls.
[62:22.93]Oh no, he took me away to another dimension.
[62:26.15]I didn't believe any of it.
[62:29.47]The idea seems silly, until the loud man.
[62:35.33]You see, sometimes I take quick breaks during a jog.
[62:40.93]I check my pulse, make sure my shoes are tied, nice and tight,
[62:52.45]As I reached down to tighten my shoes is when I heard the sound.
[62:58.95]Quick, loud, distinguished, a swift thunk, a thunk.
[63:07.72]The feeling was immediate.
[63:11.42]Breaking bone, bending cold, I thought possibly it may have been a
[63:22.83]No way!
[63:24.41]It felt as if something entered my body and froze it to its very core.
[63:29.86]I went to one knee and let the chill dissipate.
[63:34.16]The sky opened up at that moment, and for the first time in nearly a decade, rain started to fall in December.
[63:45.25]I quickly brought myself up and checked my surroundings, my body still aching from the frost in my chest, fighting the rain back as I tried to move, each step more deliberate than the last.
[63:58.29]Finally, in the pouring rain, I spotted a figure.
[64:03.73]A figure exiting from the loud man's house.
[64:18.30]or near that house, it was supposed to be abandoned.
[64:23.13]And then a hunch over small rail man emerged through the dark.
[64:38.71]It was hard to make out through the rain, but he was dragging something or possibly someone.
[64:48.70]The faint jingle of bells could be heard with each pull of the oversized sack, and the gurgling, awful grunts coming from the loud man's mouth sounded like they were grating through the very gates of hell.
[65:08.20]I felt I had to do something.
[65:11.10]But I was frozen in place.
[65:12.58]A statue of a man did I turn into.
[65:16.60]Should I run?
[65:17.47]Should I walk?
[65:18.51]Should I scream?
[65:20.17]Nothing seemed normal.
[65:21.71]Everything seemed out of place.
[65:24.25]What felt like an eternity had passed.
[65:26.69]I needed to make a move.
[65:28.75]I put one foot in front of the other.
[65:55.97]Just checking in to make sure your printer works now.
[66:00.01]We are watching the stream and saw you had difficulties.
[66:04.15]Thanks for installing our easy print software.
[66:08.17]Thanks to our monitoring agreement, we were able to fix it remotely from our end.
[66:14.63]Thank you, Jerma985, for choosing DeskJet.
[66:45.80]The loud man stopped dead in his tracks as I put one foot in front of the other.
[67:08.94]like skewing through my very being.
[67:11.34]His jaws started to unhinge and his mouth opened nearly a foot across.
[67:25.01]And I heard the most unnerving sound I will ever hear.
[67:39.43]I pouted away, far outmatching any competition I had ever been in, street to street, sign to sign.
[67:45.95]I ran as far as I could.
[67:48.68]I ran for nearly ten minutes.
[67:51.10]Hearing the distant wails of the loud man's cries, I ran until the rain dissipated and the clouds let up and the world seemed at unease.
[68:17.90]quickly that I heard the news.
[68:23.53]Santa had disappeared.
[68:27.91]It was on every radio station, every TV channel.
[68:31.75]You couldn't pass a group of people on the street without some form of conversation playing out about the recent events of his disappearance.
[68:43.96]How?
[68:44.62]Why?
[68:47.03]That was one year ago today.
[68:51.11]No one believed my tale.
[68:54.35]I was seen as a liar, a fraud.
[68:58.03]The debate rang out across the globe on whether or not Santa was even actually real or not.
[69:09.98]Nations in conflict twitter ablaze with confrontations
[69:20.74]And to this day, we're still not so sure.
[69:27.78]I have tried to live a normal life, questioning my own sanity and the reality each passing month.
[69:40.56]But hear me now.
[69:43.44]I still feel those eyes.
[69:47.17]I still see
[69:54.97]he touched deep within my bowels.
[69:59.19]It has not left me since last year.
[70:04.04]Signed, Jake R. That was absolutely devilish.
[70:25.94]Thank you for joining me on a Halloween stream that I was not able to do before.
[70:42.82]What?
[70:44.26]For the purposes of this, I've got to get my time here, you know.
[70:48.84]So, I've been told by Jeremy that we are going to, before the present opening ceremony,
[70:56.12]We are going to go over some of his favorite clips from the past year of streaming.
[71:02.45]Because it's been a full year.
[71:05.17]I know it's crazy to think about that.
[71:07.95]But I'll see you dastardly fucking dickheads later.
[71:13.02]Enjoy the clips of the past year.
[71:18.24]Tell it again, tell it again, tell it- Listen, I've told the story like four times.
[71:23.06]Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?
[71:43.87]Stay the fuck away from yard tools.
[71:46.09]Don't touch anything dangerous.
[71:47.37]Don't, like, rake your leaves.
[71:48.54]You're gonna, like, duh!
[71:49.58]And then all of a sudden you got $1,400 worth of dentistry work.
[71:52.88]Actually can't beat him.
[71:55.14]He swings way too weirdly.
[71:57.92]And I can't even get the correct controls right.
[72:00.70]Shouldn't do R2 twice.
[72:01.82]Don't even think about it.
[72:05.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[72:06.87]Come on.
[72:08.75]No, no, no, back up!
[72:11.51]No!
[72:12.59]Oh!
[72:16.20]What the fuck?
[72:17.36]Yikes!
[72:18.92]Okay, it's a big guy.
[72:20.54]I don't know what to do.
[72:22.98]Holy shit.
[72:24.96]This guy.
[72:26.18]I gotta jump.
[72:27.92]Listen to this music that's playing.
[72:30.16]Oh my god.
[72:30.90]Sir, you seem to be having trouble with your car here.
[72:34.03]Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow metal.
[72:37.91]Oh, and I farted!
[72:39.19]And I farted!
[72:41.65]I don't see how people think that's weird.
[72:44.18]Why do you think that's weird?
[72:45.10]You think that's weird that I've never eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?
[72:47.43]I'll get pepperoni for you here.
[73:03.76]Tell it again, tell it again, tell it- Listen, I've told the story like four times.
[73:09.01]Just please, let me be the example for this, okay?
[73:29.59]Stay the fuck away from yard tools.
[73:31.83]Don't touch anything dangerous.
[73:33.11]Don't, like, rake your leaves.
[73:34.29]You're gonna, like, duh!
[73:35.31]And then all of a sudden you got $1,400 worth of dentistry work.
[73:38.61]Actually can't beat him.
[73:40.87]He swings way too weirdly.
[73:43.65]And I can't even get the correct controls right.
[73:46.43]Shouldn't do R2 twice.
[73:47.57]Don't even think about it.
[73:50.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[73:52.59]Come on.
[73:54.47]No, no, no, back up!
[73:55.07]No!
[73:57.17]Oh!
[74:01.93]What the fuck?
[74:03.09]Yikes!
[74:04.65]Okay, it's a big guy.
[74:06.27]I don't know what to do.
[74:08.71]Holy shit.
[74:10.69]This guy.
[74:11.91]I gotta jump.
[74:13.65]Listen to this music that's playing.
[74:15.89]Oh my god.
[74:16.63]Sir, you seem to be having trouble with your car here.
[74:19.76]Well, let me fix that for you with a yellow.
[74:23.60]Oh, and I farted!
[74:24.92]And I farted!
[74:27.38]I don't see how people think that's weird.
[74:29.92]Why do you think that's weird?
[74:30.84]You think that's weird that I've never eaten pepperoni on my pizza before?
[74:33.16]I'll get pepperoni for you here.
[75:16.46]save and uh let me grab something and put the mic over here closer hold on a second there we are there we go that's a little bit better okay so we've got to the uh present opening portion of the stream and if you're curious what the hell this is uh a while back uh the chat talked about how
[75:45.98]You know, oh, let's buy them Pikachu and Pokemon plushies on the internet.
[75:51.23]And I thought it was funny.
[75:52.39]So I said, okay, well, what if we just gave chat a budget to just buy some presents for Christmas?
[75:58.98]And it was a decent idea, I guess.
[76:00.52]People thought it was fun.
[76:01.96]And that's exactly what happened.
[76:03.32]I just put up about $400 or so for chat to...
[76:09.05]Suggest presence and the mods also suggested presence as well.
[76:12.81]I don't know what any of these are I have absolutely no idea and by the way, don't believe any things you hear from internet scary stories because they're just then none of them are real and if you think of demons are real then you just I mean that they're made up by like like the you think the Ghostbusters might be real but they're not the Ghostbusters was made up by like a handful of guys about it was funny to make like ghost stories and shit but uh
[76:38.70]uh he's gone I I made sure he got paid and he's gone so just don't believe anything here on the internet because the internet's obviously up they don't like believe anything on the internet so uh I don't know what any of these are I have kim uh wrapped them and italics uh my wonderful tech director here has uh has bought them under my amazon so I have no idea what they are
[77:02.47]And we also, by the way, we have the Christmas magical fax machine.
[77:08.64]So if you do have something to say, it's going to be printed out here.
[77:12.56]If you give a bit donation, it's going to be printed out here.
[77:18.28]Probably, maybe, I don't know if it fucking works.
[77:22.18]But let's get started.
[77:23.82]So there are like 20-something GIFs.
[77:27.89]And I want to make this very clear because I think maybe some people don't know what's going to happen at the end of this.
[77:33.48]If there are things in here that I'm not going to use, or if there are things that I think are not worth maybe me keeping long term, if there's some things that might, maybe some of the family or some of the person might get better use of, if it's a toy or something, then that with the train as well is going to go to a donation circle.
[77:53.79]So we'll see.
[77:55.39]I might just keep some of this shit.
[77:57.36]We'll find out.
[77:58.04]So the first one we're going to open, and this is not like a bit, by the way.
[78:02.18]like the last couple of things with bits, but you know, this is not a joke.
[78:06.32]I don't know what the fuck is in here.
[78:08.20]So let's go to open this one.
[78:09.29]This is the first present we're going to open.
[78:12.37]I don't know what it is.
[78:14.45]And it's like weird, like, oh yeah, there's like a few hundred dollars to like buy me presents from my own stream.
[78:20.09]It's like a little weird, but it's just an unboxing kind of thing.
[78:23.63]I thought it was fun.
[78:26.59]And this is called, um, this is the nut button.
[78:31.29]Okay.
[78:33.54]I already can't wait to know what this is.
[78:34.90]This is the first thing I open, and this is this fucking stupid thing.
[78:45.31]What the hell am I gonna- I can't donate this.
[78:51.15]What am I gonna do with this?
[78:56.42]There is no use for this item.
[78:59.56]It doesn't serve any purpose.
[79:01.40]Not one.
[79:05.48]Can I melt this plastic down and turn it into, like, fucking water bottles?
[79:11.60]Nut.
[79:12.54]That's all it does.
[79:13.20]Nut.
[79:14.18]Nut.
[79:15.02]Nut.
[79:16.74]Oh, yeah.
[79:17.14]Oh, by the way, guys, I'm going to donate most of the items here to families in... Oh, yeah.
[79:22.62]Nut.
[79:23.20]Nut.
[79:23.60]Yeah, let me... What the fuck?
[79:25.98]I don't know what I'm going to do with this.
[79:29.05]There's the nut button.
[79:30.09]That's the first item.
[79:30.81]Okay, we're going to go small for... No, I knocked it over.
[79:33.77]Let's go with this one.
[79:37.73]It's a Garfield costume.
[79:39.17]I know what this is already.
[79:42.05]This is a fucking Garfield.
[79:43.45]I know it's a Garfield costume.
[79:45.29]And I'm just going to fucking open it because I know exactly what it is.
[79:58.98]Captain Morgan, I want to see the Grifters basketballs.
[80:06.91]I don't have time for that.
[80:08.53]What?
[80:09.67]Captain Morgan says, I want to see the Grifters basketballs.
[80:13.81]Freudian Weapon says, can you tell Ninja to stream on Christmas?
[80:23.31]I don't know Ninja.

[80:58.39]I don't want to do that.
[80:59.45]Like, who am I going to donate this shit?
[81:04.36]Hey, by the way, you want a Garfield costume?
[81:06.98]No, I'm not putting this on, okay?
[81:09.02]That is fucking believable.
[81:25.25]This is so a Garfield costume.
[81:33.84]I'm taking this off in, like, five minutes.
[81:39.87]Okay, it fits.
[81:40.77]It actually fits really well.
[81:41.77]How do you guys know my, like, size?
[81:58.58]That was fun.
[81:59.12]Let's get it off.
[82:03.90]I'm sorry, mom.
[82:04.82]I'm sorry, mom.
[82:08.26]Mom is like watching the stream and she's probably like, what the fuck is my son doing?
[82:14.50]So this is gift number three.
[82:17.62]Again, I don't know what these are and we'll find out.
[82:26.79]Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me.
[82:28.41]I talked about this like not even two weeks ago.
[82:33.17]This is an airzooka.
[82:34.21]You gotta shoot me in the fucking face with this thing.
[82:37.07]I'm serious.
[82:41.43]Airzooka.
[82:49.45]These things are so awesome.
[82:51.07]From a mile away, you can hit somebody right in the face.
[82:53.69]You'll see the air.
[82:56.15]Oh, I can't wait to donate this.
[82:59.25]Someone's gonna have so much fucking fun with this thing, seriously.
[83:10.65]Uh, How To Printer says The Great Canadian with $50.
[83:13.85]That's how.
[83:20.72]Oh, fuck.
[83:24.16]Uh, thank you from Zero Two for the $10.
[83:26.48]Hey, Jerma, my name is Lucy and your streams make me smile so much I made Jerma Remix 10 for green screen night and I felt so proud when it was shown.
[83:33.93]This community is so great.
[83:34.95]Thanks for the laughs.
[83:35.61]Happy holidays.
[83:37.10]Happy fucking, oh, Edgemont, thanks for the $50.
[83:39.08]Your fax machine is broken.
[83:41.32]The thing is, this thing sucks, okay?
[83:44.26]You want to know why the stream was like an hour late?
[83:46.66]Because we were trying to figure out so desperately how to get this fucking thing to work.
[83:51.16]It is a basic HP printer that's plugged in with USB.
[83:56.57]Oh my goodness, was it a fucking pain in the ass.
[84:00.65]But, help, I'm trapped in the printer, says Spartan Cat.
[84:05.01]Well, you're out here now.
[84:07.01]You're out now.
[84:08.55]An airzooka, if you don't know, is a device.
[84:12.41]I don't have to read the rules.
[84:16.87]So you pull on one end, and I'm gonna shoot it out right in the face, watch this.
[84:22.60]Make sure I box this up nice, because this is fucking awesome, awesome.
[84:25.76]Whoa, there's pieces here.
[84:31.80]Yep, so you pull back on this, and it gives a bunch of air pressure forward.
[84:45.72]so hey you're gonna tell me if this hits you like right in the face I used to be really good at this shit can I take the garfield costume off like can I that's like that's funny right it's off that has to stay on is it weird that I don't care
[85:12.60]I wanna get the Garfield fucking costume off of my body.
[85:19.32]You're gonna lose viewers, but the Garfield costume gets to come off, so that's like a plus.
[85:29.32]Alright, so here's this part.
[85:33.22]I could snipe people away from so far.
[85:34.96]Alright, hold on, let me get this.
[85:47.60]Is there instructions with this?
[85:48.80]Okay, here's the bottom.
[85:50.55]I gotta plug it in here, okay.
[85:52.69]Dude, check this out.
[85:54.51]I want, I'm serious, dude.
[85:55.85]I want you to stand across the whole entire studio and I want you to shoot me in the fucking face with this.
[86:02.84]People think this is a joke, but this is the real deal.
[86:21.82]I actually need the fucking instructions.
[86:29.04]Did I put it on wrong?
[86:34.79]I think I put it on wrong.
[86:35.65]All right, hey, can you, like, figure this out?
[86:39.41]Can you, like, fucking... Well, because it's, like, too hard.
[86:44.89]It's too hard for my fucking tiny brain.
[86:47.11]Just read the instructions.
[86:49.35]And, like...
[86:52.47]I have the trigger on the wrong way.
[86:54.41]All right, airzooka.
[86:55.83]That's a lot of fun.
[86:56.95]I can't wait to get fucking in the face.
[87:01.51]Get a good pile over there.
[87:11.53]All right, next one.
[87:13.83]I'm sorry, dad.
[87:15.57]All right, here's another one.
[87:19.20]So again, this is just an, I already, I explained it like four times.
[87:31.55]What is this?
[87:40.31]Five pound box of assorted misprintractable office big bulk lot.

[88:34.21]I'm gonna take like three of these and store them.
[88:45.87]What am I gonna fucking do with these?
[88:46.99]I'm gonna have to donate them or send them somewhere.
[88:50.66]Jesus Christ, that's really funny.
[88:58.09]What is this?
[89:00.55]This is from Nationwide Insurance.
[89:05.65]Who packaged this shit?
[89:08.37]That's what I wanna know.
[89:10.47]Somebody had to put these all into a box.
[89:16.79]What weird pen company are you?
[89:20.37]This is like a misprint.
[89:22.49]I'm gonna take a trip to a bunch of law offices and be like, you want some fucking pens?
[89:28.95]Well, thank you for the pens, whoever suggested that.
[89:31.87]That's good stuff.
[89:34.19]Get this one.
[89:34.71]You still trying to figure out the air, Zuka?
[89:40.88]Get this off.
[89:41.54]You're gonna have to hire some more help for this one.
[89:46.40]Is my hair all fucked up?
[90:04.39]It's the Bitcoin inner gnome.
[90:06.22]11 inches high gnome statue, exclusively designed by Joystick, hand painted with exquisite details.
[90:15.94]Funny Bitcoin good luck charm.
[90:18.10]Great for indoor and outdoor use.
[90:23.38]This is gonna have to go on my desk.
[90:24.58]It's gonna have to.
[90:27.71]Oh God.
[90:30.77]I have to see what the fuck it looks like.
[90:42.11]Fucking Bitcoin.
[90:44.77]I haven't talked about Bitcoin in like seven months.
[90:53.34]Oh, fuck.
[91:06.18]This thing sucks.
[91:08.67]This sucks, okay?
[91:10.81]I...
[91:18.10]There you go.
[91:24.54]This doesn't go in your, do you put this in your front lawn?
[91:27.04]Is that what it's designed for?
[91:31.49]I have no idea where this goes.
[91:33.09]Do you put this like on your kitchen counter?
[91:35.79]Why would you own this?
[91:37.45]Hey, remember that thing I bought that dropped 75% in value?
[91:43.39]This must have been a product that was sold like 11 months ago and people thought it was cool.
[91:49.96]Well, I'm gonna have to, I'll just put it on my mantle.
[91:56.59]God, all right, what's next?
[91:58.73]I got so much fucking trash.
[92:01.81]Can you grab like a trash box?
[92:06.42]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[92:08.10]This one's heavy.
[92:20.25]This is the walk-a-roo stilts.
[92:34.27]Easy walking handheld stilts.
[92:48.26]Oh, great.
[92:49.90]Yeah, let me like put these on and pretend I'm fucking 6'4".
[92:55.58]I can't even.
[92:58.66]Why do they have to have like children on here?
[93:00.70]That just makes it so much worse.
[93:02.40]Yeah, I'll just throw it in there.
[93:05.71]Walk-a-roo.
[93:10.35]I'm not even going to be able to reach these.
[93:12.17]We're going to have to cut to the other camera.
[93:14.65]Well, I...
[93:25.06]Who would have thought that it would be that hard?
[93:28.13]Oh, my God.
[93:30.27]Hey, Merry fucking Christmas and happy holidays to you.
[93:33.87]How bad does my hair look?
[93:35.93]Be honest with me, dude.
[93:37.09]Like, be real.
[93:37.75]I want you to be honest.
[93:39.70]Like, should I put, like, something on?
[93:42.28]Should I put the hat back on?
[93:45.44]But I'd rather look terrible.
[93:51.29]Look, I can't.
[93:51.93]I'll open that later.
[93:53.77]Look at all this shit.
[93:58.99]What am I going to do with this?
[94:02.17]God, okay.
[94:03.69]I'll do this later at the end of the stream.
[94:06.01]Alright, we got some more.
[94:09.76]There's a stocking here.
[94:15.78]Let's go ahead and open the stocking.
[94:16.98]Why not?
[94:27.34]This is a single earbud.
[94:39.68]So I get this one.
[94:41.12]I actually do get it.
[94:41.92]A single earbud.
[94:45.03]That was my favorite one.
[94:47.45]Because it's actually, I mean, it's pretty comfortable.
[95:04.55]Okay, for those of you that have no fucking idea what this is, I can't wear two headphones because I'm fucking strange.
[95:13.45]And when I have two headphones in, it causes me all kinds of distraction and stress, and it closes me off from the whole world, and I feel weird.
[95:21.94]So thanks for the one earbud.
[95:25.38]Do I get stereo from here?
[95:26.72]Can I get stereo sound from this?
[95:27.52]You only need one channel.
[95:35.34]I'm actually going to use that.
[95:37.02]I'm actually going to use that one.
[95:40.86]Hey, how's that Arizuka doing over there?
[95:44.53]What else is in the stocking?
[95:54.90]I don't know what this is.
[95:57.18]What is this?
[96:06.39]This is black gloves.
[96:10.62]What's the joke?
[96:11.26]I don't understand.
[96:15.24]What's the joke here?
[96:17.18]It's just long black leather gloves.
[96:21.60]Eye fill.
[96:24.40]Care instructions.
[96:25.20]Hand wash.
[96:25.96]Do not wring.
[96:26.90]Do not tumble dry.
[96:27.96]Is this a sex thing?
[96:30.12]Hey, is this a sex thing?
[96:33.10]Do you know?
[96:36.82]I said no sex things.
[96:38.20]I don't think I can answer that question.
[96:42.74]I can't even fit my fucking hands in here.
[96:45.45]What?
[96:49.67]You put this handle on?
[96:51.15]Yes.
[96:51.71]So that's why I can't figure it out.
[96:53.79]What is fucking going on here?
[96:56.29]Oh, those are for your feet.
[97:00.49]Are you sure?
[97:00.99]Oh, yeah.
[97:01.79]They're for your feet.
[97:04.38]No, they're not.
[97:05.00]They're gloves.
[97:05.68]This says... No, there's a hand... I'm not taking my fucking socks off.
[97:17.21]Are you sure these aren't just weird gloves?
[97:20.67]Why would somebody wear these?
[97:24.47]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[97:42.05]Are you talking shit or is this for real?
[97:45.30]I'm serious.
[97:45.96]I put this on my feet.
[97:47.38]Yeah.
[97:50.20]That's what the gift is.
[97:52.38]It's foot leather gloves.
[97:54.26]Amazon Prime, baby.
[97:56.41]Foot leather gloves.
[97:58.71]Yeah.
[98:01.37]I just don't understand it.
[98:06.05]Okay.
[98:15.52]This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[98:19.08]I've seen a lot of dumb shit in my whole life.
[98:22.38]And honestly, I went to fireworks one time.
[98:24.98]I went to the fireworks show when I was probably 14.
[98:27.28]And they did like four fireworks and it ended the show.
[98:31.30]And I said to myself, I'll never see anything stupid in this.
[98:33.60]Never in my life.
[98:35.02]And I have now.
[98:37.18]This is the worst thing I've ever put on my body.
[98:39.54]It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[98:43.74]The airzooka's not... You broke it.
[98:45.48]I broke the airzooka.
[98:46.40]You weren't supposed to put the handle on here.
[98:48.92]Just take the handle off.
[98:50.28]You take the handle off.
[98:51.62]With your feet or something.
[98:52.76]You've got good grip down there.
[98:54.44]I don't... Who would ever put these on?
[98:59.88]I've got to move on because I can't handle this.
[99:02.72]Don't throw it to me.
[99:07.22]All right.
[99:07.72]This is another gift.
[99:20.56]Maybe there's like feet in here.
[99:21.82]Top banana award.
[99:37.40]That's all that's in here is this top banana award.
[99:47.85]How much was this?
[99:48.49]Do you know?
[99:49.59]It's more than one.
[99:51.35]I know there's like 30.
[99:52.05]There's at least 10 in here.
[99:55.45]We'll show them all.
[99:57.11]What do you mean, show them all?
[99:58.77]You can't see them.
[100:06.12]How many top bananas can there possibly be?
[100:10.14]Isn't there only one top banana?
[100:12.44]What?
[100:13.00]That doesn't make any sense.

[127:33.19]Easy joke.
[127:34.47]All the balls.
[127:37.69]But like really though, like thanks to Italics for being like tech director.
[127:41.26]He's been the one that's switching scenes and like taking care of things.

[128:04.19]Hey, we gotta talk about presents to unwrap.
[128:10.25]I can't wait to, like, fucking drink coffee at home.
[128:15.72]This one first.
[128:16.74]That one first.
[128:17.42]Pacing.
[128:18.44]Pacing?
[128:18.94]We have to pace this production.
[128:21.34]Why?
[128:37.38]Oh, it's the Lord of the Rings.
[128:40.66]It's a Gandalf costume.
[128:42.34]Hey, look at me.
[128:50.90]All right.
[128:54.96]Thank you, by the way.
[129:02.06]Get this fucking Garfield thing off.
[129:05.18]Do I have to wear the whole costume?
[129:08.02]I took the entire Garfield costume on.
[129:09.86]I mean, you know what?
[129:13.98]This is actually, for all the shit I talked, this is pretty comfortable.
[129:18.06]I could see no one wearing this and Jim Davis having a terrible creation and the thing's not even funny.
[129:23.51]And like after 1996, they should have canceled the entire series.
[129:27.63]And there should never have been another book ever made.
[129:30.63]And I don't know why it's an American icon.
[129:32.69]But it's comfortable outerwear, I think.
[129:38.29]All right, here's the frog soap, can't wait to fuckin' on that.
[129:41.41]No!
[129:48.39]Hey, Gandalf!
[129:50.81]How do I open this?
[129:56.09]Huh?
[129:57.44]Define this one?
[129:58.52]All right, do I have to put the whole thing on?
[130:05.28]I shouldn't have to, right?
[130:07.75]It's probably one piece.
[130:10.39]Is it one gigantic piece?
[130:12.17]How complicated do you think Gandalf's costume is?
[130:16.47]I mean, it really is just like a big gray tablecloth.
[130:20.23]Is this the beard?
[130:21.07]Holy fuck.
[130:22.17]Look at this terrible hat.
[130:25.14]Wow.
[130:25.66]Holy shit.
[130:29.94]Is it inside out?
[130:30.96]I feel like it is.
[130:31.76]Did it come with a beard?
[130:38.89]How am I supposed to put this on?
[130:39.85]Am I stepping in it?
[130:45.75]I guess I'm gonna put it on like this.
[130:50.92]Why Gandalf?
[130:52.88]How many times have I ever talked about Gandalf on the stream?
[130:56.08]Like maybe three times ever?
[131:00.11]I'm surprised there's no Hobbit costume, because, like, oh, LOL, he's got, like, his fuckin' feet.
[131:04.39]He's got his small, he's, like, 5'7".
[131:05.95]What, you give me the Gandalf costume?
[131:08.55]Alright, that's fine.
[131:09.83]That's the Gandalf costume from the Hobbit.
[131:13.26]Well, here's, like, the weird cigar that is his beard.
[131:17.26]How do I open this?
[131:29.77]This is the beard.
[131:30.51]It's like a fucking... What?
[131:33.17]It's like a lunch lady hair in it.
[131:34.94]No, it's like a snake.
[131:36.12]How is this a beard?
[131:37.98]This is a beard.
[131:39.30]This is the beard?
[131:41.92]What?
[131:43.85]Oh, it's a beard.
[131:48.41]Where's the beard?
[131:50.31]I don't understand where the beard is.
[131:57.27]All right, when I say this, you're gonna put on like a cool voice.
[132:00.89]But wait till I get the whole thing on.
[132:05.25]Okay, so where's the beard?
[132:09.38]This costume didn't come with a beard.
[132:12.72]Seriously, where's the fucking beard?
[132:14.62]There's clearly a beard on that thumbnail thing.
[132:30.06]Where's the fucking beard?
[132:30.90]There's no beard.
[132:37.79]What a scam.
[132:38.43]There's no beard.
[132:42.71]Was I supposed to buy a beard separately?

[134:57.90]And there's somebody's card in here.
[135:01.05]OK, because I was wondering where the fuck these went.
[135:03.65]All right, well, that's great.

[154:21.56]You're going to see lots of fails.
[154:22.74]You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping.
[154:26.04]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[154:29.60]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[154:31.62]Let me take a sip.
[154:34.10]Ah, that's good cider.
[154:36.90]All right.
[154:37.62]So let's get this started.
[154:39.32]Create new world.
[154:41.52]World name is going to be Germacraft.
[154:47.06]Sounds about right.
[154:47.94]Yeah, okay.
[154:49.20]Game mode is going to be Survival.
[154:52.12]That's the most interesting, I think.
[154:54.25]More world options.
[154:55.39]Seed for world generator.
[154:56.53]Okay, this is important.
[154:58.27]I got to name this something crazy to get cool strides.
[155:05.37]It's not Germacraft unless you have something crazy happen.
[155:07.70]So I'm going to go fight this asshole over here.
[155:11.87]Look at this cows too.
[155:12.69]Do I have, I didn't have a sword.
[155:15.51]This is gonna be interesting.
[155:18.11]I should have just made one.
[155:19.22]I should have just made a sword.
[155:20.46]What am I doing?
[155:21.64]Why am I doing this?
[155:23.00]Why am I going after this guy right now?
[155:25.70]What is the matter with me?
[155:26.72]Actually play this game.
[155:31.00]I just, I'm just using my walls.
[155:36.07]Oh yeah, that's fine.
[155:36.73]I'm just gonna tear down my own walls to get wood.
[155:42.42]It's this, right?
[155:43.20]Yeah.
[155:43.40]A little bit of light.
[155:49.03]Aim up.
[155:50.57]Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't disappear.
[155:54.79]That's what Grandpa told me.
[155:58.57]Look at that beautiful moon.
[156:00.91]So elegant.
[156:04.44]Okay, so I got that wood.
[156:05.82]Let's do something with it.
[156:08.06]Let's make it into a bunch of things.
[156:13.46]Just shift click.
[156:15.78]I promise this is not gonna be this much of a mess through the whole series.
[156:20.24]Promise.
[156:21.82]And if it is, then whoops.
[156:31.58]Why, hello there.
[156:33.68]Welcome to another episode of Germacraft.
[156:37.48]And as you can see, I'm doing a little bit of renovating.
[156:40.42]Doing some renovations on the house.
[156:43.30]if you could tell, because this thing is a mess.
[156:46.72]Just trying to clean it up a little bit.
[156:48.58]And, oh my God, no, this happened before.
[156:52.25]Don't worry, got it.
[156:53.73]Keep going below with the coal.
[156:57.27]Mine the steel.
[156:59.81]Mine the steel.
[157:02.41]We got to mine that steel and mine that cobblestone.
[157:07.32]Where the hell am I even going?
[157:11.29]Alright, let's go.
[157:12.49]I will find something before this pick breaks.
[157:16.88]Or it'll kill me.
[157:31.42]Oh yeah.
[157:32.71]Aimlessly digging around.
[157:35.05]Best part about Minecraft.
[157:38.93]Torch.
[157:45.93]Ooh, he found a little bit of coal.
[158:26.24]Did I get the wrong way?
[158:51.77]All right, you've got to come zipping.
[159:01.62]You gotta zip me.
[159:06.76]Does this, like, go inside?
[159:08.00]All right, zip it up.
[159:16.08]Is it doing it?
[159:16.62]It's all the way from the crack.
[159:20.09]You gotta start.
[160:01.19]We're stuck.
[160:35.32]What's left?
[160:45.57]Oh, thanks, man.
[160:50.30]Thanks for the iPhone charger.
[160:53.08]Sick.
[161:08.89]I can't see in this fucking mask.
[161:19.23]This is very disorienting.
[161:21.44]What?
[161:22.16]Hold on.
[161:22.54]I'm going to have to pull against your neck.
[161:25.56]All right, do it.
[161:31.77]Put your own hand up there.
[161:32.49]I don't want these.
[161:34.31]Don't drop them.
[161:35.27]Pull that thing over your head.
[161:37.07]It's in the back.
[161:38.21]All the way at the back.
[161:41.67]What?
[161:41.95]No, no, no.
[161:42.93]Here.
[161:44.09]What are you talking about?
[161:45.23]Grab here, right there, and pull that thing over your head.
[161:50.46]No, no, no.
[161:50.92]It doesn't work like that.
[161:51.80]It's like a double.
[161:53.80]There's like frog eyes up there.
[161:56.48]I can't see anything with this.
[161:58.10]This is bouncy balls, cool.
[162:01.45]I'm going to donate these.
[162:06.81]I can't fucking believe these all fell out.
[162:09.36]Oh, god damn it.
[162:10.34]This is the last present.
[162:18.88]This is the last.
[162:29.72]This is vibrating my ass.
[162:31.32]This is the last one.
[162:37.68]Oh, and it is the best one by far.
[162:42.88]Absolutely best one by far.
[162:44.18]This is saltwater taffy.
[162:48.35]This is like the only thing I wanted for Christmas.
[162:52.93]Seriously, this is the only thing that I wanted.
[163:23.86]Don't spill it again.
[163:40.31]So everybody... Is that it?
[163:48.66]I can't open this because I don't have a thing.
[163:50.56]I don't have a screwdriver.
[163:58.68]Is that it?
[163:59.84]That's it, right?
[164:01.96]Thanks for the check.
[164:07.84]Why would anybody fucking wear this for more than five seconds?
[164:16.34]I actually can't get out of here.
[164:20.79]Listen, the stilts have screws, Jack.
[164:34.65]How do I turn this fucking thing off?
[164:37.01]Uh, best gifts of the evening?
[164:38.97]I'll tell you.
[164:39.49]Uh, airzooka.
[164:46.35]Sick.

[164:48.01]Saltwater taffy.
[164:49.41]Bouncy balls.
[164:50.03]Kind of fucking cool, but, like, not really.
[164:52.55]Um, bananas.
[164:53.91]Not really that cool, but, like, alright.
[164:56.57]Uh, wait, I forgot the Pepe the Frog fucking gloves.
[165:00.98]The pens, we'll never have to buy another pen forever in the rest of our lives.
[165:06.44]Where do these go, on your hands?
[165:08.12]All right.
[165:10.04]Gloves.
[165:12.40]Like this.
[165:16.74]What?
[165:19.07]This is fucking stupid.
[165:21.55]Well, that seems to be the end of the gifts.
[165:28.01]I'm gonna see what is donatable.
[165:30.70]Train's going to go to a public library.
[165:33.60]Some of this other stuff is going to go to charity.
[165:37.73]You got it?
[165:40.35]Did I fuck that whole thing up by putting it on wrong?
[165:42.67]Yeah.
[165:42.81]You put the handle on the wrong place.
[165:46.93]The seagull's awesome.
[165:48.03]I'm going to be using that on my desk.
[165:50.26]The bananas, I don't even know what to do with them.
[165:54.20]This is too many of them.
[165:55.14]This is like 100 of them.
[165:58.09]It's going to be fun to pick up in about 10 minutes.
[166:03.03]But I'm just going to wear this for Halloween next year.
[166:07.25]What are you doing?
[166:09.62]Oh, you're showing the elaborate pilot ship.

[166:43.50]It's not real, he's a made-up character and people make up characters all the time.
[166:47.00]So just know that people make up characters all the time and it's a made-up character but whatever they're making up for the character.
[166:52.00]So, uh, thank you all for watching that's the end.
