[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.98]What's happening?
[00:05.40]How you doing?
[00:09.80]You said no delays?
[00:12.80]It's 4.02.
[00:16.19]It's 4.02.
[00:16.93]I actually turned the stream on at 4.01.
[00:23.19]No, there were no delays.
[00:28.97]120 seconds late.
[00:29.59]Yeah.
[00:31.42]Whatever.
[00:32.24]How you guys doing?
[00:37.26]It's Cuphead time.
[00:38.16]Yep.
[00:40.54]Funny story about Cuphead.
[00:42.98]So I obviously reinstalled it.
[00:47.86]I got into the game.
[00:49.44]Just to get a feel again how the game works and everything, right?
[00:52.68]And I beat... Because my save file didn't carry over for some reason.
[00:56.77]I don't know why.
[00:57.15]It's been a long time.
[00:59.01]So I beat the first five or six bosses.
[01:03.83]and kind of painfully went through some of the run and gun levels just to get some money to be able to get some of the upgrades.
[01:08.01]And I was just like, I fucking hate this game.
[01:12.25]It's like, I hate this.
[01:14.55]And the DLC fights are apparently way harder, right?
[01:31.02]So I figured that would be a funny title.
[01:36.20]No, I'm kidding.
[01:36.99]It's going to be fun.
[01:40.73]But I don't have my save file, so I don't have all the unlockables.
[01:43.27]But I don't need the unlockables.
[01:44.27]This is all I need.
[01:45.63]I need the spreader, the invincibility power-up, and that's it.
[01:52.97]I don't care about anything else.
[01:53.88]Just give me the spreader attack and the invincibility, and I got it already.
[02:02.40]I'm ready to go.
[02:07.36]You want the homing one?
[02:08.32]Well, if I have problems, I can... I have smoke dash too, yeah.
[02:11.36]I got enough to make it so I was gonna not get destroyed, right?
[02:15.16]I also... Okay, I gotta remember how I did the controls last time.
[02:18.82]Did I make B dodge or circle dodge on PS4?
[02:24.56]Because it... Triangle or Y... What?
[02:28.44]Triangle or Y is dodge by default.
[02:31.91]I'm trying to remember what I did.
[02:39.79]Does anybody remember?
[02:40.43]Did I do R?
[02:42.33]I did R2.
[02:44.39]R2 is probably not a bad idea.
[02:45.75]R2 for dodge.
[02:51.48]Shit, that's actually a really good idea.
[02:53.44]I might do that.
[02:56.70]I did change it.
[02:57.30]I remember I did.
[02:57.86]Because I got really mad.
[03:08.89]But, before we do anything, I have a few announcements.
[03:14.70]Announcement number one is about the green screen.
[03:17.94]I told you I'd have some things ready for you.
[03:20.66]So, everybody?
[03:26.04]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[03:27.20]Hello?
[03:27.89]Hello?
[03:30.35]You have... Should I wait?
[03:32.61]I wait until a lot of people get here.
[03:41.37]Is this your face on the moon and the planets?
[03:44.87]What kind of ego megalomaniac would do something like that?
[03:47.63]These are NASA imagery.
[03:56.82]Okay.
[03:57.54]Well, let's wait.
[04:05.32]Wait a minute.
[04:06.58]Just hang on a minute.
[04:13.21]The best part about this is I could have had this changed a bunch of times by now.
[04:20.68]Since this thing was created, there's, what, three or four other planets?
[04:26.66]Only two planets exist in this solo.
[04:28.74]It's Earth, Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun.
[04:33.92]That's it.
[04:34.44]There's no other planets.
[04:35.26]And we have every planet at this point.
[04:39.55]I like to think that at some point, I don't know.
[04:41.75]It's funny to me.
[04:45.20]Put the emotes in the chat right now that are not in the solar system in the intro.
[04:57.55]Jeremiah, I haven't watched in a year.
[04:59.01]Let's go.
[05:02.41]Hold on.
[05:06.98]I have a couple of announcements.
[05:08.68]I have a couple of things to talk about.
[05:13.98]And I'm just hanging out.
[05:14.60]We're just sitting around.
[05:17.60]I haven't watched you in 10 years.
[05:18.84]You know what's kind of funny?
[05:19.88]Somebody could actually have said that.
[05:22.87]Hey dude, I watched your Grandpa Insane Aquarium video.
[05:25.65]And then I didn't come back for 10 years.
[05:28.17]You could actually say that.
[05:32.74]That much time has gone by.
[05:38.69]Alright, are you ready?
[05:39.73]Here we go.
[05:40.07]Alright, let's talk about green screens.
[05:41.41]First of all, green screen, you have until 12.01 on Monday the 18th to submit a green screen video.
[05:59.15]That is precisely two weeks from this moment right now.
[06:03.31]Pacific.
[06:06.40]So, essentially, Sunday the 17th at night.
[06:09.61]If it's not ready, it's not ready.
[06:10.73]You have two weeks.
[06:16.49]There are rules you need to follow.
[06:19.19]They are in the Discord right now.
[06:20.83]They're posted there for you to read.
[06:24.57]Read the entire set of rules before you do anything.
[06:31.00]That's too long.
[06:31.84]I'm gonna forget.
[06:37.46]he's giving us homework what do you mean rules there are there are rules tell us the rules I mean I could tell you the rules or you could just go read the rules right now right this very second you could I want to read you the rules do you have to hear it from me is that what it is
[07:07.69]Would you like me to read you the rules?
[07:08.86]Alright, let me read the... They will be posted in the... Look.
[07:12.84]There's gonna be a form.
[07:14.82]Don't worry.
[07:15.80]Just keep an eye on the Discord.
[07:20.36]There'll be announcements.
[07:21.18]There'll be things.
[07:21.68]Just go look in the green screen submissions form.
[07:26.12]I can read you the rules if you want.
[07:27.92]Let's do that.
[07:28.40]Fine.
[07:29.33]Okay.
[07:34.21]Ladies and gentlemen.
[07:36.01]Rule number one.
[07:37.69]Listen to me.
[07:39.35]Let me find them, because I wrote them.
[07:42.49]And I need to find where they are.
[07:45.91]Here they are.
[07:48.72]Ladies and gentlemen, your submission... Submissions must be between 10 seconds and 3 minutes.
[08:00.16]And they have to be uploaded to YouTube.
[08:05.23]Between 10 seconds and 3 minutes.
[08:09.15]Just like in previous years.
[08:12.73]Also, if your video is of me just dancing, or of a song or something, it cannot be longer than 30 seconds.
[08:24.09]30 seconds for kind of a dancing loop, if that's what it is.
[08:29.49]11 seconds, got it.
[08:30.29]Yeah, that's fine.
[08:32.06]There is a max of... Stop resident sleep ring me.
[08:34.78]This is important green screen information.
[08:37.97]There's a max of two submissions per... I really am just going over the syllabus.
[08:42.33]Can I just play Cuphead now?
[08:44.63]I feel like a teacher.
[08:46.89]There's a max of two submissions per user.
[08:50.11]This actually is really important.
[08:51.44]I need to make... I gotta make this really clear.
[08:53.32]This rule is important.
[08:54.92]Listen to me.
[08:56.57]you can only submit two times.
[08:58.93]If you have previously submitted a video for an old Community Content Night,
[09:05.07]And you want to resubmit it.
[09:07.03]That submission had to have come in after the last time we did the broadcast.
[09:12.51]May 22nd, 2020.
[09:15.45]So do not submit something before 2020.
[09:17.65]That is a green screen edit that you still have.
[09:19.53]It's not going to be accepted.
[09:21.68]But on top of that, if you do fall in that category, if you do fall in that category, it is incredibly highly encouraged that you reevaluate the video and add some potential new content.
[09:35.49]Think about how much time has passed since we last did this.
[09:37.65]A lot of the jokes in some of these videos from two years ago, probably not relevant anymore.
[09:44.52]So, I'd rather have stuff from recent time than from two or three years ago.
[09:50.22]But you guys told me to read this!
[09:52.42]You guys, you told me to read this.
[09:53.98]You said, I want to know.
[09:55.04]Read it to me.
[09:55.58]Okay, here's the next rule.
[10:02.97]The amount of submissions will likely be 5 to 10 times larger than any previous time we've ever done this.
[10:07.36]So any submission that comes in will potentially not be shown or seen regardless of its quality.
[10:32.98]There are ten rules.
[10:35.68]You're gonna be here for a while, you little shit.
[10:41.63]Oh, whatever.
[10:41.99]You can read them if you want.
[10:45.87]Somebody told me my porn setting was on.
[10:48.77]Oh, this is... Okay, this is pinned.
[10:50.45]These are pinned messages.
[10:51.35]Oops.
[10:52.13]Alright, let's play Cuphead.
[10:55.81]Fine.
[10:56.23]I don't wanna read anything.
[11:06.18]Well, that would have been fun to hear that.
[11:09.22]Delicious last course.
[11:10.82]It's a delicious last course.
[11:13.23]It's kind of loud.
[11:18.37]How loud is that?
[11:19.49]Okay.
[11:19.81]Alright, you guys ready?
[11:23.65]What's up?
[11:32.20]You guys good?
[11:36.06]Good.
[11:37.20]What's a good place for a webcam for this game?
[11:44.19]Those rolls aren't put up yet, so nobody can read them.
[11:48.41]Oops.
[11:49.41]They'll be there.
[11:50.13]You got two weeks to make the video.
[11:52.25]Read the rules.
[11:52.80]They'll be there in like an hour.
[11:55.78]Why does it look off-center?
[11:58.40]Is that off-center?
[11:59.20]Whatever.
[11:59.88]Alright, Cuphead DLC, let's go.
[12:01.07]Yeah, 48% already in the main game.
[12:02.25]What?
[12:02.39]I played for like two hours last night.
[12:07.25]What?
[12:27.63]Alright, so I wanted to get some money.
[12:31.89]Center, right?
[12:32.39]What do you mean?
[12:33.57]Like over here?
[12:36.07]Like here?
[12:36.69]I feel like that's going to block a bunch of shit though, isn't it?
[12:40.57]What is it?
[12:40.93]Down here?
[12:41.31]Should I even just turn the webcam off?
[12:47.36]Bottom right's better?
[12:48.94]Doesn't that show lives though?
[12:49.90]I don't know.
[12:53.94]Yeah, I know this film grain in this game.
[12:55.56]You can't turn it off.
[12:56.36]Unless you go into, like, the system files.
[12:58.20]But whatever.
[12:58.58]I would probably... I would turn it off and somebody would say I was cheating.
[13:03.24]You know what I mean?
[13:03.68]Somebody would be like, oh, he turned off the vignette.
[13:06.44]Now, of course the game's easier for him.
[13:10.34]Alright, so let me go see... I want to see the DLC.
[13:15.29]Yes, I've beaten this game before, but I came in here.
[13:19.31]Here we go.
[13:19.77]So I talked to... I want to see.
[13:20.89]I want to see the DLC.
[13:24.18]I didn't do this Oh, shut up How come you're so orange?
[13:37.17]This is a new webcam Fucking legendary chalice to be looking for all the way out here
[13:55.99]Oh gosh, Cuphead, I don't know.
[13:57.61]I hope she's okay.
[13:58.83]We sure are far from home.
[14:04.98]Jumping jelly beans!
[14:05.92]You boys made it!
[14:06.94]I have the most amazing news!
[14:09.04]And it all has to do with these here cookies.
[14:11.92]Take a bite and see for yourselves.
[14:14.72]Wow.
[14:15.70]That was probably really loud, I'm sorry.
[14:29.01]Is that that loud?
[14:30.47]I fucking hate microphones.
[14:33.82]Of course, I don't hate microphones unless, you know, I like microphones if they're a road wireless go-to.
[14:42.30]The best microphones.
[14:44.01]Is that worse noise?
[14:51.71]It might be.
[14:52.81]Whatever.
[14:53.91]Alright, so for ages I've been trying to find a way to escape the astral plane, but nothing worked.
[14:59.03]Until now, boys.
[14:59.97]Let me introduce you to... Chef Saltbaker.
[15:03.74]The greatest chef in all the land.
[15:06.80]Welcome, friends.
[15:08.06]Welcome to my bakery.
[15:09.78]Ah, Miss Chalice.
[15:11.58]I see my cookie has worked wonders on you.
[15:15.77]Oh, my stars.
[15:20.45]I'm a ghost again.
[15:22.68]Oh my, a finicky thing, that cookie.
[15:24.68]The taste is sweet, but the effect is brief.
[15:28.23]Fret not, though, my concerned little cups.
[15:31.67]I've come up with an amazing new recipe.
[15:34.63]One bite of this wonder tart and you'll have complete control over the astral plane.
[15:42.28]This wonder tart could bring Chalice back to life for good.
[15:44.80]No swapping places or nothing.
[15:47.22]Indeed, just one problem.
[15:48.12]The recipe requires exceptional ingredients held by the most fearsome of foes.
[15:54.82]Well, if the wonder tot is what it takes to bring Chalice back to life, then by golly, we'll find those ingredients!
[16:01.93]This game sucks.
[16:09.65]I'm sorry.
[16:11.01]Alright, fetching those ingredients.
[16:13.09]Remember, like any good bake, heart and soul is a secret ingredient.
[16:18.58]Look, I'm just getting it out of the way.
[16:21.89]I'm getting out of the way before I rant about game development, okay?
[16:30.54]Mad because bad.
[16:31.40]Yeah, that's fine.
[16:33.64]Alright, so we're just gonna bring the ingredients back.
[16:37.44]Alright, should I... I gotta change some stuff here.
[16:39.30]Hold on.
[16:41.90]Should I try R2 for Dash?
[16:47.31]I feel like that's a good idea.
[16:48.13]R2 Dash...
[16:51.39]R1 lock.
[16:52.42]Switch weapon L1.
[16:55.06]Wait, switch weapon maybe Y. The film grain.
[16:58.90]Turn off the film grain.
[17:00.64]It's on every single person's stream.
[17:03.30]Nobody turned it off the film grain.
[17:04.94]Don't make me turn off the film grain.
[17:06.90]You're going to make me the only person to turn this off?
[17:11.59]I turned off the film grain.
[17:13.89]Okay, switch weapon.
[17:14.99]I'm going to say...
[17:17.72]triangle that makes more sense than the l1 right and then dash r2 switch weapon triangle ex shoot that's fine alright let me try that see if that's better this is gonna take a little bit of getting used to I think whatever I'll die a few times
[17:42.11]Turn off the screen shake.
[17:43.47]There is no screen shake.
[17:45.56]One more thing, chaps.
[17:46.36]Remember to equip that nifty cookie charm in the menu if you want to battle as Ms.
[17:49.84]Chalice.
[17:51.42]Oh, okay.
[17:55.30]Play as Ms.
[17:55.80]Chalice.
[17:56.18]Gain access to her double jump, dash parry an invincible roll.
[18:01.94]Um... What?
[18:07.97]Let's see how that works.
[18:09.99]I don't have any chal... I don't... I don't... Whatever.
[18:13.00]What's this one?
[18:14.08]Recipe for Ms.
[18:15.16]Chalice.
[18:17.82]Why are you orange?
[18:18.54]I don't know!
[18:19.12]It's his new camera!
[18:21.06]Oh, alright.
[18:23.74]Seems like kind of a short jump.
[18:26.12]Oh, but it's double jump.
[18:27.12]Parry dash.
[18:32.56]Wait, you can jump?
[18:33.38]You can dash twice?
[18:37.89]Okay, this character is broken.
[18:41.33]This character is fucking broken.
[18:45.54]Broken character.
[18:46.64]Broken.
[18:48.20]Okay.
[18:48.98]Dodge roll?
[18:52.02]Dude, broken character.
[18:58.52]Okay.
[18:59.27]Alright, that's cool.
[18:59.75]What the fuck?
[19:07.47]What does it want me to do here?
[19:11.03]Dodge roll?
[19:15.04]Oh, okay, whatever.
[19:15.68]Alright, I get it.
[19:22.38]It's pretty cool.
[19:24.04]He's a journalist!
[19:25.46]Alright, what is this?
[19:33.02]Oh, alright.
[19:33.24]Could use that to buy, uh, homing missiles.
[19:34.68]Let me explore.
[20:01.85]What's that?
[20:02.39]What's that?
[20:03.13]What's that?
[20:03.59]What's that?
[20:04.01]What's that?
[20:04.47]What's that?
[20:05.01]What's that?
[20:07.25]What's that?
[20:07.75]Alright.
[20:14.47]It's a really unoriginal joke and chat's gonna make it worse.
[20:16.89]I don't know what I did.
[20:17.59]What did I do wrong?
[20:18.11]Okay.
[20:19.47]How much money do I have?
[20:20.85]-2, you're armed.
[20:34.50]Okay.
[20:35.70]Hold on a second.
[20:36.70]All these people that are screaming, you dudes, you're orange.
[20:49.85]I've just gotten more orange.
[20:56.54]This doesn't feel right, though.
[21:00.50]Is that right?
[21:02.88]I feel like that's also not right.
[21:08.56]Why am I only orange and red?
[21:16.02]I look like all the... Whatever.
[21:19.79]It's gonna stay like this.
[21:22.95]This is fine.
[21:23.51]This is fine.
[21:24.09]This is fine.
[21:24.43]It's gonna stay like this.
[21:25.05]This is fine.
[21:27.83]Alright.
[21:28.31]Start banning complainers.
[21:32.24]You have a twilight filter on?
[21:36.63]I don't!
[21:37.07]This is just how the camera came out of the box!
[21:39.99]Twilight filter?
[21:42.87]It is!
[21:43.31]It is like a soft filter!
[21:44.85]What the fuck is going on?
[21:51.13]Why is it doing this?
[21:55.76]This is just how... I took it out of the box and I turned it on.
[21:58.76]I swear to you.
[22:00.02]There's nothing... I didn't turn anything on.
[22:01.32]This is just how it came out of the box.
[22:03.24]Snapchat filter.
[22:07.19]It's new, I don't know.
[22:13.99]Whatever.
[22:16.52]Alright, what should I buy?
[22:18.34]Broken relic, a simple bauble of unknown origin.
[22:20.36]I only have five coins.
[22:22.78]Heart ring?
[22:24.06]Gain one HP on your first, third, and sixth parry.
[22:26.26]That's actually kind of good.
[22:32.46]Crack shot.
[22:36.46]And, uh, this.
[22:39.44]Alright.
[22:40.74]I don't have any money.
[22:42.34]What team?
[22:42.60]Are you team Edward?
[22:43.36]No, I'm not team Edward.
[22:47.97]And I'm not team, um, Lucas, whatever it is.
[22:52.09]I'm team merchandise.
[22:54.03]I'm the guy that I see what's going on here, and I start designing t-shirts for the two teams.
[22:58.57]And make a trillion dollars.
[23:02.53]Alright, let's go.
[23:07.34]Gnome way out.
[23:08.50]Let's just give it a try.
[23:10.62]Who is Lucas?
[23:11.04]I don't know.
[23:11.42]What's the other character's name?
[23:14.15]Hey, Spikes!
[23:30.09]How do I get away from that?
[23:39.48]Ow.
[23:45.96]Geese X-ing?
[23:50.98]Oh!
[23:59.28]What's the special for this Dilawb?
[24:04.95]Alright, alright, whatever.
[24:06.81]I didn't even fucking come close.
[24:07.71]Alright, so this guy sucks.
[24:09.43]I haven't played Cuphead in six years, okay?
[24:12.23]Relax.
[24:14.23]I haven't played Cuphead since 2016, okay?
[24:15.44]Give a relax.
[24:39.91]I'm kind of getting used to the new controls.
[24:43.63]What the fuck?
[24:46.89]Where do I go?
[24:50.79]Oh my god.
[24:51.49]I thought it was an invincible dash.
[25:00.73]I thought it was an invincible dash.
[25:02.33]Didn't it say that her dash is invulnerable?
[25:08.31]Oh, the roll is invincible.
[25:10.87]Whatever.
[25:14.54]Ah!
[25:14.92]Start over.
[25:16.72]The roll is invincible.
[25:17.72]Whatever, I... Where are they going?
[25:42.71]Shut the fuck up.
[25:45.41]I'm fucking, I'm so mad.
[25:48.87]I got complacent.
[25:53.33]I can't even see.
[26:01.22]R2 is dash, R2 is dash, R2 is dash.
[26:10.63]I don't even have all the items, okay?
[26:11.93]I don't even have all the items.
[26:15.90]And by the way, Steam Cloud.
[26:16.88]Does Steam Cloud only last for a year?
[26:18.46]Why is my Steam Cloud saved?
[26:20.60]How come my Steam Cloud doesn't exist?
[26:22.20]Where is it?
[26:39.04]What the fuck just hit me?
[26:39.72]Nothing even touched me!
[26:40.52]Alright, go go go, we're good, we're good.
[26:52.55]Phase two.
[27:35.36]I don't think I like... I want to try this character.
[27:37.67]Different character.
[28:03.88]So much shit all over the screen!
[28:08.77]Fucking god damn it.
[28:10.19]Alright, what do I have for a move right now?
[28:18.56]I actually don't even know.
[28:22.66]What's that?
[28:22.92]What does that do?
[28:24.80]What does that do?
[28:45.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[28:46.98]What even hit me?
[28:55.75]Oh shit!
[29:10.16]A great plan has been done.
[29:13.47]And began!
[29:38.23]And it fucked me up!
[29:38.97]It should have invincibility frames when you do a dodge.
[29:40.97]Parry.
[29:50.45]Does this give me an extra life?
[30:05.73]There's too much fucking shit to look at!
[30:27.14]Alright, get out of here.
[30:28.20]Come on, come on!
[30:33.20]Oh my god, where am I?
[30:53.00]WHAT THE FUCKING CEILING HURTS?!
[31:02.37]The ceiling hurts.
[31:07.55]The fucking ceiling hurts.
[31:09.43]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[31:38.66]Excuse me?
[31:39.54]Where's the... Excuse me?
[31:41.78]Excuse me?
[31:42.50]Where's the other shit?
[31:43.92]Where the fuck am I?
[31:45.08]Where are they?
[32:11.52]Oh my god, I tried to jump.
[32:13.20]Alright, this one's... I just gotta be wary of where they're jumping out from.
[33:03.19]Come on.
[33:08.79]Alright, come on.
[33:09.13]I got three health.
[33:09.75]Let's go.
[33:10.29]And I have a punch.
[33:12.11]Alright, shh.
[33:12.61]Quiet.
[33:12.81]I got it.
[33:24.12]What the fuck?
[33:41.33]What the heck just hit me?
[33:46.87]Bro, don't even.
[34:12.69]Did I get the little parries?
[34:19.59]What?
[34:21.39]I got... How did I not get three parries?
[34:24.39]I paired three of the... What are you talking about?
[34:25.97]That's stupid.
[34:27.27]Three parries!
[34:33.24]Does that not count as a parry?
[34:36.85]Ooh, I got the gnome berries.
[34:40.21]What does that do?
[34:42.69]It doesn't count.
[34:44.05]How loud can I scream?
[34:44.97]I don't want to do it because I have bad microphone settings.
[34:51.81]Alright, that was fun.
[34:55.62]Wait, is there anything else I can do?
[34:58.20]Can I go down?
[35:00.16]Not yet.
[35:00.76]Alright, let's do this one.
[35:03.79]Equip the Crackshot weapon.
[35:06.37]Is it better?
[35:08.91]Crackshot.
[35:10.13]Straight shot with good damage breaks into weaker aimed projectiles?
[35:17.78]Okay, wait.
[35:18.18]Super Art.
[35:18.76]Shield Pal.
[35:19.36]Someone unfamiliar from the... We'll take one hit for you.
[35:25.92]I'll try.
[35:26.32]I'll do this one.
[35:28.28]Should I stay as...
[35:30.18]I don't know what that does.
[35:31.00]Alright, I'll try this for a little while.
[35:33.62]Snow Cult Shuffle.
[35:34.78]Let's try it.
[35:39.87]And begin!
[35:50.80]Fuck off.
[35:55.30]I know how to switch weapons!
[35:56.10]Stop telling me!
[36:00.06]This one sucks What the fuck Okay, um what the hell is this thing doing?
[36:26.02]What is the power?
[36:29.40]Ah, excuse me.
[36:34.26]I'm going fucking what I usually do.
[36:45.64]Then we should have been dead!
[37:22.16]How did I not hurt anything?
[37:27.65]I didn't even hurt it.
[37:28.57]I don't know what this thing is doing, but it's kind of cool, I guess.
[37:56.93]Alright, I got- What the fuck is that thing?! !
[38:25.72]You piece of shit.
[38:37.20]This thing does a lot of damage.
[38:47.53]So that doesn't count as a parry.
[39:03.48]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[39:04.34]That was such horse shit and you all know it.
[39:07.15]Oh, invincibility, huh?
[39:19.24]Jesus.
[39:21.58]What does this do?
[39:26.44]Okay.
[39:26.92]What?
[39:29.19]I don't get it.
[39:34.15]What does that do?
[39:42.41]Is it just vertical damage?
[39:56.34]Why would you use these?
[40:05.93]What the fuck?
[40:35.83]That stupid ass popsicle dog shit.
[40:37.78]Like, I'm gonna come from all stage right and hit you.
[40:40.54]Oh my god.
[40:48.22]This match will get red hot.
[40:50.86]You're up!
[41:05.95]I press B to dodge like an idiot.
[41:19.46]Wait, what was it?
[41:20.12]It takes 10,000 hours to master something?
[41:22.06]I don't have that much time to play Cuphead, okay?
[41:36.38]Those popsicles are dog shit.
[41:38.17]I hate them.
[41:39.29]Especially during this fight like this.
[41:40.63]Like, they just kind of... You can't even fucking dodge them.
[41:42.24]They just... What the
[42:05.59]A great slam and then stop.
[42:07.95]Now go!
[42:08.77]A great slam and then stop.
[42:11.61]You're up!
[42:32.57]You should be invincible after you parry something, for like a tenth of a second.
[42:39.58]Shitty RNG, throw fucking coins in the air and see what lands on heads or tails.
[42:47.83]They fucking throw coins in the air, they land on tails?
[43:32.53]Yeah.
[44:04.65]Oh god, what does this mean?
[44:38.63]I can't hit, I can't!
[44:42.40]Don't, what the fuck was happening?
[44:44.70]I was trying to dash into the thing and it wouldn't hit it!
[44:50.06]I put the ball out, I'm trying to dash into the ball to shoot it and I touched it like three times, what the fuck?
[44:57.34]This match will get red hot.
[44:59.83]And begin!
[45:01.67]Why, why, I've, I've, I've, look, let me show you what I was trying to do.
[45:06.81]What the fuck was that?
[45:11.36]I was doing this shit.
[45:12.24]Oh, it works this time.
[45:14.32]Piece of fucking junk.
[45:30.55]Piece of junk.
[45:31.77]Where's the second jump?
[45:49.38]Why would you launch me that high?
[46:01.15]I'm like a ping pong.
[46:13.01]Oh my god.
[46:15.05]Shit.
[46:32.31]I hate this thing.
[46:33.45]Get this thing off.
[46:34.29]I don't want to use this thing anymore.
[46:35.88]It didn't shoot the little snow guy.
[46:44.22]I can't get tilted on boss two.
[46:51.12]He's getting tilted at a children's game.
[46:52.74]Alright, I'm telling you right now, all kids would cry if they played this.
[46:57.77]You give this to a kid that under 10 years old, they're going to cry.
[47:02.30]After 5 to 10 minutes.
[47:03.76]They're gonna cry.
[47:06.98]You wanna make a kid cry?
[47:08.60]What's wrong with you?
[47:09.68]Fucked up?
[47:10.14]What's wrong with you?
[47:13.53]What, are you fucked up?
[47:19.73]Alright, just don't get hit again.
[47:32.90]That was such a bad roll right there.
[47:34.94]There's nowhere I could have gone.
[47:42.97]Heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails.
[47:45.53]Oh, shit.
[47:45.97]I lose.
[47:46.73]I lost.
[48:13.55]Oh, come on.
[48:27.48]Wait a minute.
[48:30.80]Fuck you, game.
[48:32.70]That's not a damaging move.
[48:36.30]That white snow that goes across the screen does not hurt you.
[48:42.02]Really?
[48:42.79]It's to show you that here come the spikes.
[48:46.35]I've been trying to dodge that the whole time. ...
[49:15.60]Let's freaking go!
[49:26.64]Fuck you!
[50:05.42]Okay.
[50:06.94]So those don't count as parries.
[50:08.50]Can you not parry, actually, as Chalice?
[50:11.90]I do look red.
[50:12.72]Why do I look so... I look red or orange on this camera?
[50:17.54]This dude's drinking fossil fuels?
[50:28.08]oil?
[50:28.26]Hold on, let me, this doesn't look right.
[50:31.89]This looks so fucking wrong.
[50:38.39]It's only red or orange.
[50:40.01]I'm doing every single other setting.
[50:45.90]Is that better?
[50:52.26]Maybe a little.
[50:53.32]I look really washed out.
[51:02.55]You look really dehydrated.
[51:05.56]I don't... I don't know.
[51:08.28]I think... Whatever.
[51:08.94]That's fine.
[51:09.58]I don't care.
[51:13.14]Washed up.
[51:18.60]Alright.
[51:18.98]That was... That was fun.
[51:24.40]What's this?
[51:26.20]Say, young fry.
[51:27.40]I'm hot on the trail of a mystery.
[51:29.61]But I'm...
[51:32.13]That contest of skill, that broken artifact, this eerie graveyard.
[51:36.49]I've discovered part of the astral energy in all of these places.
[51:41.35]There must be an order and method to it.
[51:44.12]Okay.
[51:48.86]One, two, three.
[51:49.28]One, two... Nope.
[51:54.98]Nope.
[52:03.14]Nope.
[52:04.24]One, two... Uh, here.
[52:07.26]No.
[52:09.33]One, two... Really?
[52:16.13]I don't get it.
[52:30.44]What's the... Wait, wait, let me read this again.
[52:34.07]I'm hot on the trail of a mystery, but I'm stumped.
[52:36.71]That contest of skill, that broken artifact, this eerie graveyard.
[52:42.11]Okay, contest of skill, the broken artifact, the one in the middle, and the eerie graveyard is this whole thing.
[52:47.12]No, it doesn't matter.
[52:47.66]There must be an order.
[52:50.84]How am I supposed to know there's an order?
[52:58.65]Yeah, I don't know.
[52:59.23]I'm just considering guess.
[53:03.26]There's no way I can know.
[53:04.08]Maybe I'll do it later.
[53:04.92]Alright, this looks like a plain one.
[53:09.10]Doggone dogfight.
[53:18.10]Oh god, this already sucks.
[53:22.00]Aw shit!
[53:22.30]Let's load up some Cuphead!
[53:37.15]Just duck, that's good, just duck.
[54:07.13]That just... I don't even know... I just looked over on my right side of the screen.
[54:10.95]What, that thing hurts me?
[54:18.48]How's the audio?
[54:36.40]I gotta get the super built up.
[54:47.20]Alright, phase two.
[54:58.19]What do you got?
[55:20.72]Let's go.
[55:22.52]What the fuck?
[55:23.92]Do it!
[55:26.26]Did it hurt?
[55:27.42]What just happened?
[55:31.12]Am I hurting him?
[55:35.81]What the fuck?
[55:37.45]Dude, how am I supposed to play like this?
[55:42.54]Oh my god.
[55:43.74]Okay.
[55:53.21]That makes the first phase nothing.
[56:01.11]Good day for a 12-hour and begin.
[56:41.26]Alright, come on.
[56:43.20]This one's not bad.
[56:43.84]You just gotta jump.
[56:48.83]If you guys want some actual tips on how to play games like these, I know that I... Oh, you suck.
[56:53.57]Shut up.
[56:56.12]You should be looking in a two to three foot radius around your character.
[57:01.46]I'm not even looking at the enemy right now.
[57:02.92]I'm just looking at, like, a circle around my character.
[57:05.44]Always.
[57:05.76]Fuck.
[57:07.07]Here we go, here we go, go, go, go, go, ready?
[57:20.25]God damn it.
[57:22.58]God damn it!
[57:39.22]Oh my god, that sucks.
[57:50.97]I'm going back.
[57:51.55]Okay, on that phase, we're going shotgun blast.
[57:55.07]Yeah, without a doubt.
[58:01.91]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[58:03.20]You know...
[58:12.22]A brawl is surely brewing.
[58:13.92]Come on, Gwyn.
[58:16.30]Come on.
[58:43.36]Alright, come on, let's go.
[59:12.84]Not a big deal.
[59:21.09]Fuck!
[59:24.53]Yeah!
[59:37.66]Oh my god!
[59:38.69]I just went the fucking... My fingers!
[59:40.95]I just...
[59:43.58]I hit the wrong button to switch weapon.
[59:46.15]I haven't pressed that button in an hour and ten minutes.
[60:07.32]I want to change this to shotgun.
[60:16.72]Alright, this is it, this is it, this is it.
[60:23.06]This is the one, this is the one, let's go.
[60:46.05]Stop being angry and play.
[61:19.15]It hurts my fucking brain We're good
[61:48.32]No parries.
[61:48.98]I would be getting such great scores if these parries counted.
[61:52.12]Alright, somebody help me here.
[61:54.94]Somebody help me.
[61:56.46]Can I not parry as Miss Chalice?
[62:06.19]Am I... You can't... I can.
[62:08.93]Dash... But yeah, but when I dash parry, it doesn't count.
[62:13.14]Jump, dash... Wait, you can't just dash.
[62:15.34]You have to... I've done it a bunch of times.
[62:18.12]It hasn't counted.
[62:20.39]Only optional parries count.
[62:29.69]You didn't parry... Yeah, but I mean, like, this whole time I've been playing, the last three bosses, I've parried a shitload of stuff and it didn't count.
[62:37.46]I'm dashing into them and it counts as a parry.
[62:39.30]So why is it... I don't get it.
[62:47.54]I'll prove it.
[62:51.88]They weren't optional parries.
[62:58.69]Boo!
[62:59.67]Did I scare ya?
[63:01.33]Nothing I love more than a good ghost story round the campfire.
[63:12.09]I'd heard word of a ghostly gal roughing up no good varmints round here.
[63:19.90]You know what?
[63:20.24]That's been in my body for four days.
[63:26.97]I feel great right now.
[63:28.11]You know how many times I've gone like this?
[63:32.33]Looking up to a light and towards the bright sun and stuff.
[63:36.13]I'm not looking at the sun, but you know what I mean?
[63:37.73]I haven't got that out in four days.
[63:41.75]Stop talking about me.
[63:42.41]That's what that means.
[63:43.80]Alright.
[63:44.86]I'd sure love to tell the tale of the villainous veggies vanquished.
[63:50.04]Okay.
[63:53.44]High noon hoopla.
[63:56.96]You should make chat slower.
[63:59.74]There were 500,000 people here.
[64:01.68]How is that gonna make any sense?
[64:04.91]Okay, listen.
[64:11.21]In your school cafeteria...
[64:13.78]You know how loud it is in there?
[64:15.34]Just those voices that are just... Imagine that like times 500.
[64:22.87]Of course we can't see.
[64:24.39]Of course we can't hear anything.
[64:26.31]There's like 5,000 school cafeterias in here.
[64:33.32]A brawl is truly brewing.
[64:34.68]Here goes.
[64:38.46]No.
[64:39.72]A brawl is truly brewing.
[64:41.06]You're out.
[64:44.88]Can I shrink?
[64:46.00]No.
[64:46.44]Not with this.
[64:49.30]I thought I could... Oh, I can shrink.
[64:50.40]I hit the wrong button.
[64:52.04]What the fuck is going on?
[64:53.88]Dude, what the hell?
[65:01.91]Oh.
[65:26.28]No!
[65:37.62]What the... Oh, the gold's coming out.
[65:39.39]No!
[66:05.19]What the heck?
[66:10.53]Oh!
[66:13.03]Damn.
[66:16.63]This is weird.
[66:17.47]Manit, manit, manit, manit, manit.
[66:52.42]Come on.
[67:40.70]Yeah!
[68:08.14]Oh my god!
[68:11.98]What the freak are you talking about?
[68:14.92]You have to go through the... This one's long and this one sucks.
[68:38.80]Alright.
[69:19.97]This part is horrible.
[69:21.05]No!
[70:08.40]Get out of here I wasn't even that fucking hard
[70:20.38]So, parries.

[87:37.79]He followed me all the way back over here.
[87:46.94]Alright.
[88:04.53]What the fuck?
[88:05.43]Oh, stop!
[88:07.43]What was that?
[88:34.59]Dude!
[88:37.09]What the hell was that?
[88:42.29]Do you eat peanut butter out of the jar with your fingers?

[89:34.14]It was- It just wasn't moving!
[89:37.52]Stop doing the- Why do I do it like the fucking Daffy Duck?
[90:27.85]Get out of here.
[90:28.53]Alright.
[90:28.95]Yes.
[90:29.27]Yes.
[90:29.59]Yes.
[90:29.91]Yes.
[90:30.21]Yep.
[90:30.53]Hold on.
[90:37.82]Alright.
[90:38.28]More money?
[90:46.90]Cool.
[90:53.39]How many of these are there?
[91:01.70]I haven't blinked in, I think, over an hour and a half.
[91:13.68]Launch him back?
[91:14.77]Yeah, okay.
[91:15.15]Alright, I get it.
[91:29.80]Come on.
[91:32.25]Oh, this shit's coming out of the bottom.
[91:51.89]Dude, stop shooting that.
[91:57.51]I was trying to be fucking cheeky.
[92:01.10]What?
[92:01.54]No, go this way!
[92:45.88]Bro There it is alright
[93:10.21]More money?
[93:19.14]Ooh, that's a different door.
[93:23.84]Stop being good at this game.
[93:29.66]Again, I need to make sure everyone's very aware of this because it's very important that I continue to prove this.
[93:36.28]If the game has two to three moves,
[93:40.35]I will fucking dominate it.
[93:44.39]Jump, dash, shoot.
[93:46.77]That's it.
[93:50.46]I will absolutely destroy that game if there's two moves.
[93:54.58]If the move is jump and shoot, I'm gonna do very well.
[94:00.48]I'm very simple, right?
[94:02.14]I'm very simple.
[94:03.28]But with the simple shit, I can do it pretty well.
[94:06.12]Just like dodging an axe.
[94:08.74]Not that hard.
[94:10.84]It's just move out of the way of the axe.
[94:14.02]I think I would be very good at it.
[94:18.06]You know what?
[94:18.52]Honestly, you know those rooms with the lasers that all the spy movies where they go in?
[94:22.30]Watch out for the lasers.
[94:24.36]I would be that person in the heist.
[94:26.48]The person that you send in to make sure they don't touch the lasers.
[94:30.77]That's it.
[94:31.15]My only job is to don't get touched by this thing.
[94:34.07]It won't touch me.
[94:36.45]It just will not.
[94:40.64]Ooh, this is cool.
[95:18.52]Oh, I ran out of juice.
[95:37.79]You ran into a stationary microphone.
[95:41.42]I wasn't trying to dodge the microphone.
[95:44.78]See, that's where your logic is flawed here.
[95:48.84]If somebody picked up the microphone stand or the microphone and threw it as a javelin at me... It would be... It would not touch me.
[95:58.05]I wasn't dodging it.
[95:59.15]I was unaware of its existence.
[96:05.86]Three coins.
[96:08.89]Tournament has concluded.
[96:09.87]Henceforth, my castle shall remain a training ground for thee.
[96:12.77]Fare thee well, champions.
[96:13.76]That's cool.
[96:20.44]Are there more little hidden secret little things like that?
[96:26.63]So how can I do that?
[96:35.11]Can I turn the fire on?
[96:38.86]do the puzzle.
[96:40.90]How?
[96:47.70]Should I know it at this point?
[97:03.83]I can't believe I've won.
[97:04.69]Things are looking up.
[97:07.41]Second place just ain't right.
[97:09.27]Down one place from last year.
[97:13.04]It ain't right.
[97:13.48]I trained too hard only to come in third.
[97:18.20]Wait.
[97:20.52]Things are looking up.
[97:23.02]So, what?
[97:23.92]Middle?
[97:24.76]First row middle?
[97:27.64]Just ain't right.
[97:29.00]Down one place.
[97:31.86]So, down right.
[97:33.40]So, middle, top, right most.
[97:41.44]It ain't right.
[97:42.00]And then right?
[97:44.30]So it's middle, right, right.
[97:48.38]Or middle, right, left?
[97:49.18]No?
[98:06.89]What the fuck was it?
[98:08.51]Not right.
[98:09.19]Yeah, okay, so hold on.
[98:25.67]Hold on.
[98:33.11]I can't believe I have one things are looking up.
[98:39.68]Second place just ain't right.
[98:42.20]Down one from last year.
[98:43.60]How do I look at it?
[99:00.28]Up, down, left, left.
[99:07.81]No health.
[99:08.57]No health.
[99:16.03]How come I can't touch the middle one?
[99:17.59]Why can't I touch the middle one?
[99:24.28]Give me the answer.
[99:24.76]I don't know.
[99:25.26]I don't care.
[99:25.72]I just want the answer.
[99:44.93]That's not right.
[100:26.87]Use the relic?
[100:29.89]How?
[100:39.37]How do I use the relic?
[100:43.00]It's equipped.
[101:00.01]That's not right!
[101:02.73]Top, middle, middle, left, middle, right.
[101:05.32]Thought I just did.
[101:07.90]Wait, top, left, mi- What did you say?
[101:16.11]Wait, they can be on the same row?
[101:17.85]That's right!
[101:19.01]Oh shit, hold on.
[101:21.17]Oh, they can be on the same- Alright, hold on a minute.
[101:28.54]Upper, bottom, middle, left.
[101:29.84]Thanks, appreciate it.
[101:31.56]Think of it as a numpad.
[101:37.17]Someone just give me the answer right now.
[101:39.27]Give me the answer.
[101:43.43]Give me the answer.
[101:44.85]Give me the answer.

[101:57.52]Up your ass.
[102:00.96]Give me the answer.
[102:06.05]Top, middle, down, right, right.
[102:11.57]Thank you.
[102:21.95]I didn't know.
[102:23.25]Whatever.
[102:26.81]I thought you were smart.
[102:29.37]Well, before I do this, let me just say one thing.
[102:32.55]Yeah, I played Diablo Immortal.
[102:36.06]I don't recommend it.
[102:36.82]Don't play it.
[102:37.74]It's not that, it's really not good.
[102:39.24]Don't play it.
[102:39.62]It's fucking, there's no reason to download it.
[102:41.64]But I got to the section where there's nine torches and you have to, you have to light all the nine torches.
[102:52.91]I couldn't do it.
[102:55.29]It was a simple puzzle.
[102:57.04]It was, when you turn this torch off, the ones next to it will turn on.
[103:03.46]I sat there for probably one full hour trying to do it.
[103:06.93]I couldn't do it.
[103:08.15]I can't do that kind of shit.
[103:09.73]We've got a raid from Joel.

[112:02.66]Alright, now I know what to do.
[112:10.72]Oh my god.
[112:12.84]Oh my god!
[112:48.18]Where to?
[112:48.62]What's going on?
[112:59.39]What the fuck?
[113:05.38]A great plan has been done.
[113:07.76]Now go!
[113:27.89]Fucking bugs in my hair.
[113:28.89]God damn it.
[113:29.55]I'm so actually mad.
[113:32.99]This one's the best one so far.
[113:37.95]I like the first boss and this boss the best.
[113:41.18]If this is the end of the DLC, which we'll find out very shortly.
[114:09.26]Let's go.
[114:19.71]Alright, don't get hit here.
[114:49.22]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[114:51.02]When do I use it?
[114:56.88]God, how are you supposed to not get hit by that?
[114:58.70]I pressed it twice!
[115:16.07]Should I not even fight?
[115:18.96]Or is this him?
[115:21.50]I'm so confused.
[115:33.01]Oh my goodness, don't die.
[115:38.19]There it is.
[115:38.85]Alright, hell yeah.
[115:57.47]That's a good aim.
[116:01.37]You didn't do every parry.
[116:02.63]No, I didn't.
[116:04.73]Cuphead.
[116:11.18]Thank goodness you're okay.
[116:15.96]That dastardly salt baker.
[116:17.90]He had us hoodwinked the whole time.
[116:23.75]Yeah, Zooks, this place is coming down.
[116:25.05]Let's get out of here.
[116:36.92]I didn't press A. No, my bakery!
[116:46.06]Serves him right for duping us.
[116:48.59]But with the bakery destroyed, you're never gonna get that wonder tart, Chalice.
[116:53.41]That's okay.
[116:53.91]If some poor soul has to be sacrificed for me to live again, it just ain't worth it.
[116:59.09]But mark my words, boys, I'm never gonna stop searching.
[117:03.12]And in the meantime, if you ever find yourselves in a scrap, I'm just one cookie bite away.
[117:11.69]Besides, who needs a Wonder Tart when they can have two new best pals instead?
[117:18.83]Oh, hold on.
[117:22.58]Well, I didn't beat the game.
[117:23.66]Okay.
[117:36.52]Did I?
[117:41.52]I'm not done streaming.
[117:43.22]We're still going?
[117:45.44]Maybe I'll just keep playing this for a little bit because I want to try the other items.
[117:49.64]Is there any more?
[118:00.94]That's the end?
[118:01.40]Okay.
[118:04.90]Try them on expert mode?
[118:05.84]Yeah, I'll try a few.
[118:13.86]Yeah, I really completely underestimated how hard that was going to be for me.
[118:23.22]I was thinking, man, this is probably going to be at least an eight-hour experience of me playing this.
[118:37.84]You mean overestimated.
[118:39.66]You know the right one.
[118:40.32]Whatever the one that's the right one.
[118:41.94]The one where I think I'm going to be worse than I am.
[118:44.96]Cool.
[118:58.43]Our sincere appreciation to the members of our team whose loyalty and creative endeavor made possible this production.
[119:16.26]Um, so, do you want me to just keep playing?
[119:27.78]I'm still here.
[119:28.56]Why not just play?
[119:30.06]Maybe try the expert stuff.
[119:33.73]And then maybe... I want to try the other items.
[119:36.99]Dude, if I'm never going to play this game ever again, then I might as well do a little bit right now.
[119:49.09]But I think I really... Alright.
[119:51.68]So here's the plan for the rest of the day.
[119:57.76]I think as long as we do that, there'll be enough time later in the stream to be able to add some more stuff at the end, maybe do a little bit of just chill.
[120:12.05]And then we can maybe do some tomorrow.
[120:16.31]Wicked funny!
[120:24.88]Can you slow it down?
[120:25.66]I don't think so.
[120:32.41]That was a pretty cool ending.
[120:34.03]44% of the DLC.
[120:43.53]How does that make any sense?
[120:49.73]Alright, I want to... Let me see.
[121:00.44]Because I want to try the new weapons.
[121:01.94]I'm not just going to... Yeah.
[121:02.70]Converge.
[121:04.82]And twist up.
[121:06.38]And then... What's this one?
[121:09.74]Oh, parry for HP.
[121:11.84]Let me try these new moves.
[121:12.52]Okay, this is gnome way out.
[121:18.70]Expert mode.
[121:21.57]It's because of expert.
[121:25.83]Oh, it's like kind of a spreader.
[121:28.41]This one's weird.
[121:32.16]How do you make, how do you utilize this one?
[121:36.50]Honest to god, how do you utilize that?
[121:38.26]This one's not bad.
[121:39.02]You have to point it down?
[121:48.37]Ah, I get it.
[121:50.47]Does this do enough damage to justify using it though?
[121:53.06]It's kind of weird.
[121:54.66]It's weird to use.
[121:55.42]Does it do a lot of damage?
[122:03.62]It sucks.
[122:04.20]Eh, it kind of does.
[122:07.56]Alright, hold on.
[122:10.02]Let me try that one.
[122:14.09]Do the secret phase and the dog boss.
[122:16.91]This one's not bad.
[122:19.75]I'll do spread for that.
[122:21.73]Actually, maybe I should try that.
[122:22.65]Yeah, let's try that.
[122:26.65]Crackshot's best weapon in the game?
[122:27.82]Yeah.
[122:44.37]Oh, it went up.
[123:01.55]What the heck?
[123:14.28]Ooh, I like that.
[123:37.22]Good weapon for this one.
[123:38.86]Hey.
[123:44.46]Let's try it again.
[123:55.65]Actually, I didn't like this boss.
[123:56.66]It was kind of too random.
[123:58.42]So much random shit going on.
[124:27.80]Come on!
[124:28.64]This thing doesn't hurt him.
[124:29.64]Where's the damage?
[125:01.17]Oh, it does that too.
[125:01.97]Alright.
[125:03.33]Alright, come on.
[125:05.23]Let's go.
[125:08.94]What's this last phase?
[125:09.82]I forget.
[125:11.94]Oh, right.
[125:12.48]This shit.
[125:13.16]Alright.
[125:19.79]Alright.
[125:29.33]I didn't want to press that!
[125:31.79]I hate this boss.
[125:34.63]This boss is just random shit flying in every direction.
[125:40.49]What about another one?
[125:41.13]What's the secret phase?
[125:52.93]How do I do the secret phase?
[125:56.83]Change weapons in the death screen.
[126:03.39]How does that work?
[126:06.35]Don't kill any adds on the second phase.
[126:09.10]Okay.
[126:09.62]That one killed... Okay, cool.
[126:14.84]That's right.
[126:15.20]Okay.
[126:39.76]That was such shit, RNG.
[126:47.49]This weapon's kind of annoying.
[126:51.87]Alright, don't kill the dogs.
[127:09.34]A brawl is surely brewing!
[127:11.73]Now go!
[127:12.77]What?! !
[127:42.39]Okay, don't kill the dogs.
[127:58.14]You idiot.
[128:11.96]This map will get red hot.
[128:13.80]And begin!
[128:21.68]This map will get red hot.
[128:24.18]And go!
[128:54.14]Did did did you I'm just getting lazy.
[128:59.16]I already beat this dumb stupid boss.
[129:02.53]Oh
[129:42.55]Shoot?
[129:42.69]What do you mean, shoot?
[129:44.51]Shoot them.
[129:46.83]I thought you said don't attack, don't hurt them, don't kill them or something.
[129:54.99]How much do I have to hurt them?
[130:05.67]What's going on?
[130:06.37]How do I do this?
[130:11.65]What's happening?
[130:14.79]You have to do it until they have gray smoke?
[130:35.63]Alright, afterwards I want to do something stupid.
[130:41.54]Let's fuck with new people that come in.
[130:44.57]Right?
[130:45.27]I'm going to put a death counter on the screen.
[130:46.75]It's going to be like 600 something on a boss.
[130:50.07]And I'm just going to be sitting there like crying.
[131:01.21]Alright, can one of the mods set up, like, a command and add, like, 630 deaths already?
[131:08.81]So then when I die, you can do, like, exclamation point death, and it adds 631.
[131:17.60]Alright, alright, alright.
[131:18.56]Smoking.
[131:20.20]That one's smoking.
[131:22.62]They're all smoking!
[131:23.60]They're already smoking!
[131:24.73]All of them are smoking already!
[131:33.20]Okay, that one's smoking.
[131:39.04]Smoking.
[131:47.74]Smoking.
[131:48.90]Smoking.
[131:54.90]Now what?
[132:01.50]Right.
[132:02.20]Nice work.
[132:19.11]Shut up.
[132:19.59]I got out of the way.
[132:20.54]Please.
[132:23.86]Whatever.
[133:13.94]631.
[133:13.98]Hold on.
[133:15.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:16.42]I gotta get, like, into character here.
[133:18.84]And the thing is, like, let's make it so... What a dummy, right?
[133:24.07]I'm gonna use shit that I just shouldn't even be using.
[133:27.87]What's something that somebody would be like, wow, this guy's a fucking noob?
[133:31.19]Like, the extra hit point, right?
[133:33.09]I'm a noob.
[133:35.80]And I don't understand what parries are, okay?
[133:48.25]Alright, so let me go down here.
[133:51.13]Use the charm.
[133:51.89]No, no, I want it to be... Alright, here we go.
[133:53.77]Ready?
[133:57.38]And I'm going to individually press the button to shoot.
[134:21.31]How do you... You stand still, right?
[134:27.17]This is just... Hold the button down.
[134:28.25]This game's just not for me.
[134:35.12]I just really... I don't think the game's for me.
[134:37.02]But I'm going to try and... I'll do some... Mods keep track of it.
[134:47.71]Whatever.
[134:50.30]Here's a real high-class belt.
[134:52.72]Here goes.
[134:59.77]Fucking hate.
[135:00.51]It's so stupid.
[135:01.49]A great slam and then some.
[135:06.63]Now go.
[135:36.28]Ha ha ha!
[136:03.01]I don't fucking... I don't understand why people fucking play this game.
[136:06.05]I don't... I don't... I just don't get it.
[136:08.31]I don't fucking get it.
[136:09.33]I don't fucking get it.
[136:10.89]I don't get why people play this.
[136:11.99]Why would you play this game?
[136:16.11]Take a break.
[136:16.45]I'm not taking a fucking break.
[136:17.77]Stop saying it.
[136:18.41]Stop telling me that.
[136:19.31]I've been streaming for like two or three hours.
[136:26.53]You can hold to fire.
[136:29.56]I'd like to shoot...
[136:35.90]losing viewers I don't care why do and again why did people say play this and play the DLC that's what I don't understand like this community sometimes I don't play hard you guys told me this wasn't a hard this is not supposed to be a hard game why tell me to do this
[136:56.99]Why tell me to play this game?
[136:59.25]I thought it was like a fun cartoon game.
[137:01.18]You're just bad.
[137:03.42]Mods actually start fucking banning people.
[137:04.94]It's really actually really fucking annoying.
[137:07.82]Is it four more?
[137:12.10]Get the auto-aim weapon.
[137:17.49]Crying Andy.
[137:18.23]Crying Andy.
[137:20.23]Whatever.
[137:24.69]Where is it?
[137:27.57]Take a break.
[137:32.15]It sucks so fucking bad when I look over here and I see that I died 600 fucking times.
[137:38.28]Somebody said to die 600 times in two hours.
[137:57.00]It's not even possible!
[138:02.78]It takes- alright, hold on.
[138:04.44]How long does it take to die?
[138:06.52]Let's see, how long does it take to die?
[138:07.72]Count- ready?
[138:09.28]This is not even possible.
[138:10.22]Ready?
[138:12.30]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[138:20.82]Alright, let's just benefit the doubt.
[138:24.33]It takes 10 seconds to die, right?
[138:25.71]10 seconds to die.
[138:29.01]How many?
[138:30.27]10 seconds times 636 divided by 60.
[138:39.57]Alright, so if I die every 10 seconds... That means I have to die every 20 seconds for this to make any sense.
[138:52.46]At that point, man, you don't even play.
[138:54.98]Why are you here?
[138:55.74]If you're dying every 20 seconds?
[138:59.20]It's possible to do that.
[139:05.82]That would be so painful.
[139:07.16]That would actually be painful.
[139:13.47]20 seconds every time.
[139:14.71]Yeah, that means the stream turns on.
[139:17.87]There's no intro.
[139:18.81]I just start walking into depth, walking into traps, and walking into people's... There's no intro.
[139:25.74]Alright, so what should I do now?
[139:36.70]Any of the games I should play today?
[139:43.63]600.
[139:43.77]I don't think I died even half that amount of times in the base game.
[139:51.63]Let me take it to the other side.
[139:52.79]Hold on.
[139:56.18]Let me go off the DLC island.
[140:06.69]Play Tarkov.
[140:08.95]Dude, I'm not playing Tarkov.
[140:13.17]Okay, wait a minute, what's this?
[140:18.58]I didn't do this one.
[140:20.42]Did I?
[140:20.72]Oh, wait, oh.
[140:27.22]Dude, Tarkov, is it weird that I think Tarkov is a game that I want to read the manual for?
[140:34.99]Like, the shit that comes in the disk box.
[140:54.20]play Morrowind?
[140:56.56]I'm not going to play Tarkov.
[141:03.50]That's 30% of games.
[141:06.86]Go back to Miku?
[141:07.66]I uninstalled Miku because I never thought I was going to play it ever again.
[141:12.04]You hear what I'm saying?
[141:17.10]I uninstalled it.
[141:17.80]I didn't think I was going to ever play it.
[141:21.14]Chills.
[141:24.85]We'll reinstall it.
[141:30.83]Is that what you guys want?
[141:32.84]Alright, this has to be unanimous.
[141:35.74]This has to be completely unanimous.
[141:37.78]Do you want me to play that Miku rhythm game?
[141:41.34]This has to be 80%, yes. 80%.
[142:02.58]Oh no, I've been exposed.
[142:09.45]You've died 79 times.
[142:12.19]Hey, like five of those were just me fucking around, so it's like 70.
[142:18.30]I wonder... Let me do some running gum.
[142:19.70]Alright, what do we got?
[142:21.84]Playmuku.
[142:22.62]It's got a... I'm hating these levels with a passion.
[142:29.29]I'm so... You know what?
[142:29.89]I'm actually kind of glad none of these were in the DLC.
[142:36.01]I genuinely hated these.
[142:56.75]Oh yeah, what is it at?
[142:58.53]Is it even remotely close?
[143:16.10]I wanted to dash through it, not into it.
[143:23.35]I'm screwed here.
[143:24.23]Okay.
[143:42.22]This weapon is so good.
[143:49.04]Fuck.
[143:52.22]Oh, what?
[143:54.84]What do we got?
[143:55.30]That's not even... That's not close, guys.
[144:03.42]That's not close.
[144:06.02]58%.
[144:09.98]Way too many of you don't want that.
[144:12.76]I'm not playing Tarkov.
[144:15.42]I need a guide to play Tarkov.
[144:17.75]There's only one way I'll ever play Tarkov.
[144:19.27]If a Tarkov streamer or somebody that knows Tarkov is like, hey dude, I can teach you Tarkov.
[144:25.43]You can walk behind me.
[144:27.97]You can literally just walk behind me and I'll do everything.
[144:33.63]But that's not going to happen.
[144:35.59]I'm not playing Tarkov.
[144:42.68]Democracy is dead.
[144:43.98]No, this wasn't a democracy.
[144:47.62]This was a goal you had to reach.
[144:49.32]I didn't say this was a democracy.
[144:53.68]I said get it to 80% or it's not happening.
[144:55.54]If I get hit one more time by one of these star guys, I'm going to punch him in the fucking mouth.
[145:08.35]Play Isaac?
[145:09.91]Eh.
[145:11.93]Eh.
[145:21.86]Nah.
[145:26.39]I got a list of stuff we could jump into.
[145:27.73]I'll figure it out.
[145:35.65]Wobble dogs?
[145:36.55]Oh, nah.
[145:39.13]Nah, nah, I'm good.
[145:40.13]No.
[145:48.96]Stop it.
[146:09.17]Noita?
[146:10.87]I've not heard that in a while.
[146:21.02]What are you doing?
[146:21.88]I hate this level.
[146:55.30]Let's go.
[147:00.50]What about more demos?
[147:03.94]Do some more YouTube Zoomer humor videos.
[147:12.39]Morrowind?
[147:17.25]You don't want me to play Morrowind.
[147:19.15]It's gonna take us like three hours to get to the first island.
[147:28.91]Alright, get Morrowind to 80% and I'll download it right now.
[147:33.67]No, I'll make it easier.
[147:34.47]Get Morrowind to 70%.
[147:35.19]Jumbo Rebound.
[147:56.10]Everyone's gonna leave when I play Morrowind.
[147:57.64]We're gonna sit there and just listen to dialog and opening cutscenes.
[148:00.59]And I'm gonna kill the first NPC I see and have to restart the game save file.
[148:04.47]There you go.
[148:06.25]I just streamed it.
[148:06.91]I just did it.
[148:07.63]I don't even need to do it.
[148:08.29]I just streamed it.
[148:15.10]What is this one?
[148:15.72]Oh, this was in the base game.
[148:32.57]Oh, I remember this one.
[148:33.21]This is the dragon one.
[148:37.21]Can it charge even more than that?
[148:52.40]No.
[148:52.64]What was that?
[149:05.36]It's just like a pup.
[149:10.22]Uh oh!
[149:36.64]Don't these guys jump?
[149:37.98]Yeah, they do.
[149:40.76]What, you don't think I fucking knew that?
[149:45.65]I'm getting real sick of the backseating.
[149:51.63]You didn't get it to 70%.
[149:52.21]You didn't make it.
[149:53.39]You didn't make it to 70%.
[150:13.43]What do you mean riot?
[150:14.23]Recon?
[150:14.83]What do you mean riot?
[150:16.85]No!
[150:17.07]I said 70%.
[150:17.29]I made it easy.
[150:31.62]Restart.
[150:35.64]Stop.
[150:36.24]Stop.
[150:36.60]Stop.
[150:36.92]Stop.
[150:48.86]That tail should be removed from the game.
[151:04.27]Where the fuck am I?
[151:09.02]Play Peglin?
[151:21.92]Nooooooo!
[151:57.29]We want Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.
[151:59.09]You're the only one that's written that in the last hour.
[152:01.41]Good day for a swell battle.
[152:03.75]And begin!
[152:10.28]Good day for a swell battle.
[152:11.82]Now go!
[152:20.61]Oh, by the way, if you have a green screen submission... Oh, something else I wanted to bring up, too.
[152:27.40]So, a lot of people that might be new viewers might not know that... That tail.
[152:34.70]A lot of new viewers might not know the green screen stream from a couple days ago.
[152:38.76]We've done that two other times.
[152:40.86]So there are three full green screen streams.
[152:43.72]So don't... You can use them all.
[152:46.42]Don't be afraid to use them all.
[152:48.70]I think a lot of people might think that that was, oh wow, you just did that for the first time.
[152:52.22]Nope, that's the third time we've done that over the last three, four years.
[152:56.75]So I use all the footage.
[153:01.13]You have until the 18th at 12.01 midnight.
[153:02.95]12.01 midnight on the 18th.
[153:04.51]That's July 17th, very late at night.
[153:14.30]to submit your video.
[153:15.20]There are rules.
[153:16.09]Please read the rules that are in the Discord, the channel.
[153:20.07]There will be a form for you to fill out.
[153:22.46]Please do all the rules.
[153:24.38]Otherwise, you're gonna be in big trouble.
[153:43.57]That sucks.
[153:44.93]That just sucks.
[153:46.75]This is base game, we're just kind of playing for the world.
[153:48.82]But that sucks.
[153:51.28]That's a dumb mechanic.
[153:59.78]Play Cruelty Squad?
[154:04.11]I don't think I can play Cruelty Squad, guys.
[154:05.71]I looked at the trailer and I wanted to puke.
[154:08.73]I'm sure the game is fucking phenomenal, but it kind of hurts my head.
[154:17.66]Thank you.
[154:37.33]Play Breath of the Wild?
[154:38.23]I would rather play Morrowind than Breath of the Wild.
[154:45.06]Is that bad?
[154:45.64]Is that going to make anybody angry?
[155:01.90]Just right now, I want to play Morrowind, not Breath of the Wild.
[155:05.36]But I don't want to play Morrowind.
[155:06.56]I hope that makes sense.
[155:17.48]I hate this boss.
[155:19.76]This boss is stupid.
[155:26.54]I beat this four years ago, and I think I said that.
[155:30.87]The Phase 3 when the little thing comes out and you... I don't know if I'm gonna hit her or not.
[155:47.50]You know, I'm not paying attention.
[155:54.87]That's the problem.
[155:57.49]I beat the DLC in like 60 deaths.
[156:00.17]Don't ever forget that.
[156:02.01]I'm just like shit.
[156:02.75]I'm just shitting here.
[156:03.61]I'm just talking.
[156:04.45]I'm not even playing.
[156:11.74]Play Morrowind.
[156:13.48]We have to get you guys to like 70%.
[156:25.59]Do something else?
[156:26.17]I'll do something else after this.
[156:27.01]I have to beat this guy just because I'm gonna be so pissed off for the rest of the day if I don't kill this thing.
[156:37.67]Like, this is gonna ruin my day if I don't kill this guy.
[156:46.34]It's gonna ruin my whole day.
[156:49.36]More attempts on a boss that I beat fucking five years ago than the entirety of the DLC.
[157:04.59]How are you supposed- What are you supposed- How am I supposed to fucking fight this with- I gotta change weapons.
[157:20.52]Like, Jesus.
[157:26.66]That fucking tail!
[157:53.34]This is not even hard, I just don't care!
[157:55.02]Oh my god.
[157:59.20]I'm so- I don't even care, like, why do I have to- I don't have to beat this.
[158:03.24]This guy's not even hard, he's- I just don't even care.
[158:06.33]I have to kill this thing.
[158:11.25]This dumbass shit boss from 2016.
[158:31.12]I hate this fucking boss.
[158:36.26]He's so slow.
[158:38.56]And the stupid moving platforms.
[158:40.98]I don't even need to beat this.
[158:42.55]Why am I even here?
[158:44.77]I think this guy's an expert already.
[158:47.18]In front of you all.
[158:48.68]Why the fuck do I care?
[158:49.80]He has to die!
[159:23.81]These weapons suck for this.
[159:30.43]I don't care.
[159:31.53]Why am I doing this?
[159:33.89]I don't have to do this.
[159:35.11]I just beat the fucking DLC.
[159:36.99]What am I doing here?
[159:37.85]I can't take it anymore.
[159:58.04]This weapon sucks!
[160:11.80]I'm gonna freak out!
[160:18.44]Does anyone think it's funny that I'm getting more annoyed and upset at the fucking base game, which I've already beaten after dominating the DLC?
[160:27.47]Does anyone else think that's funny?
[160:28.73]Does anyone else think that's humorous?
[160:30.67]Because I do.
[160:36.19]I'm getting more annoyed at a boss from the base game.
[160:50.72]It's so easy to fucking fall down when you do that shit.
[160:57.17]This is my last try and I'm gonna fucking smash my monitor with a hammer.
[161:38.10]Doesn't own a hammer?
[161:38.86]Yes, I do.
[161:39.38]I own a mini hammer.
[161:41.47]That's all you need.
[161:42.03]You don't need these huge hammers.
[161:43.27]Stop talking.
[161:45.29]You're gonna make me mad.
[162:27.40]These weapons are so bad for this!
[162:39.59]Oh my god, I forgot I did that.
[162:42.76]Why do I care?
[162:43.62]I can't fucking stop, guys.
[162:46.94]I don't know why I need to beat this stupid boss.
[162:50.48]I've beaten this so many times.
[162:52.32]Why do I care?
[162:54.42]By the way, I have a mini hammer.
[162:55.82]It's like this big.
[162:57.30]That's all.
[162:57.62]You don't need anything bigger than that.
[162:59.81]You're not strong enough to swing a hammer a little extra?
[163:02.85]It fits in way more places.
[163:07.15]You don't need a huge-ass hammer.
[163:08.53]You just need one of the little ones.
[163:25.77]Dude, I actually have spent more time on this than any of the DLC bosses.
[163:36.68]put up that 600 deaths thing again.
[163:38.44]It's just the last phase is just unbearable.
[163:43.47]It's so easy, but it's make that makes it so hard because he just shoots us.
[163:47.02]Shut up.
[164:21.04]You can't even attack him with that- I can't attack him!
[164:38.21]Oh my god, it just auto-attacks the fucking stupid flaming orbs!
[164:51.91]I beat the fucking secret boss first try in the DLC.
[165:35.52]Look at Mod Chat.
[165:36.94]Don't distract me right now.
[165:39.19]I'm trying just to get over this dumb thing I'm doing.
[165:41.43]I'm just trying to get over playing this stupid game.
[165:47.13]I have to get over it!
[166:02.21]Should we post the rules?
[166:21.96]Alright.
[167:02.04]Yeah!
[167:04.39]What if I died?
[167:07.11]Alright, fuck this game.
[167:12.19]Stupid-ass game.
[167:12.97]I don't give a shit.
[167:18.99]Alright.
[167:21.82]Why is it breaking apart in my mouth?
[167:25.19]Okay, I'm fine.
[167:25.89]I'm fine.
[167:26.41]I don't even know why I did that.
[167:27.45]There was no reason to do that.
[167:29.13]I beat that boss like five different times over the last five years.
[167:32.41]Alright, so what are we doing?
[167:36.64]Morrowind, what's happening?
[167:42.56]Yeah, you can post the rules.
[167:46.38]Dick fart.
[167:47.74]That was a mod that said that, by the way.
[167:49.49]Just so you know.
[167:59.31]Morrowind?
[168:00.03]Copium?
[168:01.79]Should I just play Morrowind?
[168:02.69]Should I just go for it?
[168:03.95]I don't even think I own Morrowind.
[168:07.86]Do I own Morrowind?
[168:12.34]Does Morrowind even run on Windows 10?
[168:15.13]Whatever the hell I have.
