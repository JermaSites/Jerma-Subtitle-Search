[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.96]Just wait to the future.
[00:10.38]Right?
[00:11.90]Wait until... That's how a robot would communicate with a robot, right?
[00:17.27]What I just said right there in... Like, 2840... AD... Was, hey, what's up, guys?
[00:25.35]Welcome to the stream.
[00:30.07]What's loud?
[00:32.53]What's loud?
[00:35.28]What's loud?
[00:36.67]What's loud?
[00:37.65]What's loud?
[00:38.81]Me?
[00:41.25]Aww.
[00:42.72]Anyways, how you guys doing?
[00:43.60]The mic is not- I can see the levels on my other monitor.
[00:50.34]The mic muted 2014 gotcha jubaded thing ain't gonna happen to me.
[01:00.83]What's loud?
[01:06.19]Yeah, we're going to play... I'll give you a rundown of what's going to happen for the remainder of the week here.
[01:13.10]So, week one.
[01:16.02]Week one is actually... This is week two of September.
[01:21.68]So week one is week two of September, so keep that in mind.
[01:24.72]So week one of week two.
[01:27.22]We're going to end this week here, and then week two will be week three.
[01:31.04]So, at the end of week two, which is week one, we're going to do Immortal Unchained, which is the game we're playing tonight.
[01:40.28]This game just popped up.
[01:42.40]I saw that it was a fun one.
[01:46.84]The developer's name is Toadman, so that automatically makes it a 60, okay?
[01:52.43]This could be the worst game I've ever played in my life.
[01:54.37]I don't care if this game gets a 60 because it's made by Toadman.
[02:00.63]See?
[02:02.13]Look.
[02:06.62]Look at the lower right corner.
[02:08.60]And he's got a cigar in his mouth.
[02:14.16]I can't give this a failing grade.
[02:17.67]But anyways, so all stupid, not funny jokes aside at the beginning of the stream.
[02:23.42]We're going to play this tonight, depending on how long this goes or how far we get here.
[02:28.29]Or it depends on how fast I decide I don't want to play it anymore.
[02:31.91]I'm not going to be live this weekend.
[02:33.07]I have a wedding this weekend and a couple other things I have to take care of at the house.
[02:37.35]So you will see me again on Monday after tonight.
[02:41.27]And we are going to be starting... Wait for it.
[02:45.62]Wait for it.
[02:47.24]Oblivion.
[02:48.78]People have been asking me to play that for a long time.
[02:51.08]So Oblivion starts next week.
[02:57.60]Finally.
[03:00.14]I don't know.
[03:00.78]I might put a bunch of mods on too.
[03:02.50]It might not be your favorite game you remember.
[03:04.94]It depends.
[03:08.82]But without further ado.
[03:11.02]And then at... He's got another thing to talk about at the end of next week.
[03:17.38]I'm going to... It depends on how this room is lit.
[03:21.74]I have to figure out how to do it here.
[03:22.98]But I really want to try to get the green screen stream...
[03:26.97]done before I go to Las Vegas.
[03:31.50]But by the end of next week, that might be the thing we do this, like, coming next Friday or something.
[03:37.84]So that should be a lot of fun.
[03:39.66]And then the week after that, right before I leave, is hopefully going to be a big, fun stream.
[03:46.98]We'll see.
[03:47.49]Hopefully.
[03:47.97]You know, I've been wrong before.
[03:50.07]Anyways, this is Immortal... I almost just said Immortal Redneck.
[03:55.81]Mm-mm.
[03:57.07]This is Immortal Unchained.
[04:00.65]Let me make sure that you guys can actually hear the audio here.
[04:05.42]We are no longer introing.
[04:07.14]We are now getting into it.
[04:10.14]There it is.
[04:10.66]Now you can hear.
[04:13.88]So, again, this game, we could be done with this in about a minute or two.
[04:18.80]More than a minute.
[04:19.72]Hey, Watching Who.
[04:22.20]Watching Who gave five community subs right now.
[04:27.40]Thank you so much for watching, Hoop.
[04:30.93]So let's get it started, what do you say?
[04:35.51]The game is terrible.
[04:36.79]Well, look.
[04:40.42]Listen.
[04:41.94]There was a couple other options, but I decided on this.
[04:47.33]This is just gonna be like a fucking round stream.
[04:50.51]I just, look, I just got off the high of beating Spider-Man and completing it and loving Spider-Man.
[04:55.86]So now, I gotta bring myself back down to Earth, you know what I mean?
[05:00.74]Let's see how it is.
[05:04.74]See, we're making a character.
[05:06.51]Look, it's a character creator.
[05:08.59]Select name.
[05:11.99]Wow, okay, just, fine, no.
[05:14.65]Delete that.
[05:16.45]Character name.
[05:18.80]Let's see, what does he look like?
[05:20.10]Finesse, perception, strength, agility, toughness, endurance, expertise, insight.
[05:23.34]There's a lot more than I thought there was going to be.
[05:24.76]No Jex.
[05:26.44]His name should be delete.
[05:29.36]I can't even type anything here.
[05:31.28]No, no, not... How about Gurg?
[05:43.00]Gurgles?
[05:43.72]Gurgs?
[05:45.48]Gurgs.
[05:46.62]That's GGS.
[05:52.99]No.
[05:54.75]No.
[05:58.73]Gergs.
[06:01.89]That's a good name.
[06:02.79]Yeah.
[06:04.57]It is.
[06:05.17]That's like an orc name.
[06:06.21]This guy kind of could be an orc if he wanted to for Halloween.
[06:08.83]He's huge.
[06:09.77]You know that friend of yours that's always the fucking orc for Halloween because he's the big guy and it's like, we get it.
[06:14.87]You're huge and incredibly handsome.
[06:18.51]Gergs.
[06:20.69]Okay.
[06:21.31]Oh.
[06:22.81]Tracker, Vandal, Raider, Wanderer, Marksman, or Mercenary.
[06:30.49]Alright, I think Wanderer is my favorite.
[06:36.13]Since when were orcs handsome?
[06:39.32]What are you talking about?
[06:43.44]Tracker's are swift hunters.
[06:44.52]They're flexible carbine.
[06:47.70]Carbine gains increased effective range from its tactical scope, and their daggers strike fast and effortlessly.
[06:55.01]Their training and innate aspect pattern allow masterful weapon handling from minimal reload times.
[07:00.41]Boring.
[07:02.29]Vandals are masters of the art of destruction.
[07:04.71]Their defender rifles are fitted with grenade launchers to blast groups of enemies, using cleavers to finish off any survivors.
[07:11.48]They are nimble enough to avoid danger, and their innate aspect pattern makes them resistant to fire and explosions.
[07:17.95]Kind of cool.
[07:20.61]Kind of cool.
[07:22.97]Raiders are fierce killers.
[07:24.25]They favor close-range tactics to dodge around enemies to strike weak angles.
[07:28.01]Their deadly sub-guns cut through flesh and... I mean, they put the word sub somewhere.
[07:35.62]Right?
[07:37.10]His deadly sub-count gun cut through flesh and undead cortexes with ease and their axes deliver the finishing blow with unnecessary force.
[07:47.66]Whatever it said.
[07:48.68]Their innate aspect pattern increases crit damage.
[07:50.77]So this is a little dodge and, like, dodge, like... I kind of like it.
[07:57.23]Wanderers roam the cosmos, enduring its trials.
[08:00.49]Equip themselves with simple clubs and rifles, oddly fitted with exotic upgrades to freeze assailants.
[08:07.56]They seem to have an unusual insight into lost technology, and they're... Boring.
[08:10.46]No.
[08:11.06]No.
[08:13.04]You bring up the word technology, automatically you're like a shitty buff character in every RPG.
[08:18.28]Did you guys realize that?
[08:22.76]Marksmen excel at long-range combat.
[08:25.88]They use accurate rifles to acquire targets from far away and fire at critical spots.
[08:31.45]And a set of swift swords for backup.
[08:33.03]Their innate aspect makes them even more deadly at long range.
[08:35.35]This is like a sniper.
[08:37.81]No, I don't want to play a fucking sniper.
[08:39.65]A mercenary is just like a default regular person.
[08:43.72]The mercenaries are warriors hardened in the fray of battle.
[08:45.84]They favor close-range combat in both their scattergun and hammers.
[08:49.56]Ooh, wait a minute.
[08:50.33]Offer to stagger their opponents.
[08:51.69]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:53.71]And basic armor makes them resilient to damage.
[08:55.57]Okay.
[08:57.27]I like this one.
[08:58.53]I like this one and this one.
[09:01.73]Should we go with... Alright.
[09:07.12]This is the big problem here.
[09:10.02]Do we go with shitty hellboy...
[09:12.94]I wish I was in Mad Max, or Every Game Made by Cliff Buzowski, whatever his name is.
[09:20.60]I have to get a poll.
[09:36.07]We'll poll it, sure.
[09:37.51]Oh, you want to see what the females look like, sure, yeah.
[09:43.21]Alright, it's just like toned down body shape.
[09:49.64]Hold on.
[09:51.04]Yeah.
[09:51.78]This one has a mustache!
[09:56.47]They just dropped it.
[09:57.53]They scaled it down a little.
[10:03.61]That's awesome.
[10:06.73]No, I don't want to play the Wanderer.
[10:09.18]That seems boring.
[10:10.04]I think I'm going to go with...
[10:13.27]I'm gonna go with Raider, I think.
[10:15.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:16.72]Finesse, perception, strength.
[10:17.78]This is just like Dark Souls.
[10:18.84]Forget it.
[10:19.16]None of this even matters.
[10:21.42]You don't pick a class.
[10:23.52]In Dark Souls, you don't go through and go, hmm, I think I want to be Knight.
[10:26.92]I like the way that they sound and their backstory.
[10:29.06]No, you just, who has the highest fucking strength and toughness?
[10:38.31]Everything is, no, but I know that that's like a joke.
[10:41.86]Everything, this is like a Dark Souls game.
[10:44.68]This is a Souls-like game.
[10:46.32]Like, I know that we make that comparison to every video game.
[10:50.98]We're gonna go with Raider.
[10:57.02]We're gonna go with Raider.
[10:59.84]Gerg's the Raider.
[11:03.72]I like the little sub-guns, plus you guys get to look at that and go, sub-guns, nice.
[11:10.11]It even says Souls-like in the tags.
[11:13.69]I'm ready.
[11:14.37]Okay, now we actually make the character.
[11:16.29]Look, I can just make the guy that I... Can I just make the guy with the mustache?
[11:21.45]Wait a minute, hold on.
[11:25.46]So, I'm gonna be a raider that dresses up as the vandal or mercenary, whatever, for Halloween.
[11:33.94]Yeah.
[11:34.68]Let's just do mustache.
[11:40.43]Should I be red?
[11:41.05]Just make Hellboy.
[11:46.75]Make a combination of them cosplaying as every other character.
[11:54.58]Oh boy.
[11:56.82]Is that the hair color different on top?
[12:03.91]Okay, I like this.
[12:07.95]Okay.
[12:10.57]You guys want to be a streamer?
[12:12.51]Let's be like a streamer or a YouTuber.
[12:14.33]We have to be, right?
[12:16.29]That's what we are.
[12:22.42]But streamers and YouTubers don't have mustaches.
[12:36.84]There we go.
[12:38.48]I don't like that.
[12:39.60]No, I want the mustache.
[12:40.72]I don't want to be like the green hair.
[12:42.78]No!
[12:45.20]That's what I want.
[12:52.17]Put on the VR headset.
[12:54.79]No, I'm not going to put the VR.
[12:55.81]I don't want to hate this game right off the bat.
[13:01.79]It's like perfectly shaped to his cheeks.
[13:04.96]Put it on!
[13:05.76]Put it on!
[13:06.50]Put it on!
[13:07.36]Put it on!
[13:08.18]Ugh.
[13:13.04]Wait, can I change this?
[13:14.08]Alright, this is... Okay, he's worn this headset for so long that it's starting to dye his hair.
[13:19.76]It's sapping the energy from his hair follicles.
[13:21.78]I like that.
[13:22.22]Okay, no tattoos.
[13:28.67]I don't have any tattoos.
[13:32.37]Are you sure?
[13:32.83]I'm sure.
[13:37.85]In an age long since forgotten.
[13:40.86]You didn't think that was a cutscene in the beginning, did you?
[13:44.34]A prophecy once told that there would come a time when the sun would grow dark and cold.
[13:52.82]Right?
[13:53.16]That's not that far in the future.
[13:54.97]That's probably 2,000 or 3,000.
[13:55.87]A long chilling wind would surge from the deepest pits of the abyss.
[14:01.67]Nice.
[14:02.45]Nice!
[14:05.39]Dead would rise in its wake.
[14:09.97]Bad guy.
[14:10.75]Bad guy.
[14:11.91]Harbingers of destruction.
[14:14.07]Which one of these is Medivh?
[14:15.03]Which one of these?
[14:15.47]It's Medivh!
[14:22.06]Left to its own, this wind would bring war.
[14:33.57]Gandalf, listen to me.
[14:36.30]Somebody will get that.
[14:38.46]Someone will get that.
[14:39.32]I don't know who it is, but you got it.
[14:47.27]Beasts will break their bombs and flood the soil with their poison.
[14:55.49]One by one, we would all wither away to nothingness.
[15:00.50]We got it.
[15:01.00]We just didn't like it.
[15:02.40]Come on.
[15:02.72]We were willing to make impossible choices.
[15:05.74]Madagascar, bro.
[15:06.60]Warriors of legend would rise once again.
[15:09.93]Mushrooms.
[15:11.87]Lack of heart they would be.
[15:14.07]Oh, there's the PS4.
[15:16.87]Don't touch it.
[15:17.53]You'll get PS4 poison.
[15:18.59]This is the day.
[15:23.06]See, I told you this was like 2800 AD.
[15:24.56]That's the fucking- they have like a PS4 set up on like a relic.
[15:28.02]Shut up!
[15:28.66]Shut up!
[15:28.92]That was funny!
[15:29.68]That was funny!
[15:34.88]This is the end of times.
[15:42.27]Good one.
[15:44.85]There's the tutorial, this teaches you how to dodge.
[15:54.35]This is the end times.
[15:59.35]Why are we going through a bunch of locked doors?
[16:05.29]This is the 80s bad guy lair.
[16:07.91]No, it's me.
[16:16.10]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[16:17.20]It's me, SuperDude21!
[16:21.14]I seem to be locked in chains down here.
[16:24.34]Not sure what the heck happened.
[16:38.23]And you know how bad we scream?
[16:39.87]That's right, bros.
[16:40.85]We scream every start of the video.
[16:42.81]So give me your thumbs up.
[16:45.55]Decor.
[16:45.89]Alright, let's check out the fucking game mechanics so far.
[16:52.22]Okay.
[16:53.90]It plays pretty well.
[16:55.94]You move.
[16:56.46]I mean, it's kind of sloppy, but no, it's not.
[16:58.25]It's alright.
[16:59.41]This is not that bad.
[17:00.93]It's not that bad.
[17:08.79]Wow.
[17:09.87]There were three doors there, just in case you couldn't get... You know what?
[17:16.44]I'm just going to stop talking, because there's loud noises in my ears, and it's making me unable to speak.
[17:26.40]Quickly, go forth and find the Grand Hall.
[17:30.86]Okay, so I gotta walk forward here.
[17:32.84]I gotta... Alright, let's take a look.
[17:37.50]So, guys, what we've got here is we've got a bridge in front of us.
[17:40.52]Whoopsie!
[17:42.12]Wait, no!
[17:42.50]I really died!
[17:43.56]Oh!
[17:50.90]Oh!
[18:07.84]Oh, shit.
[18:08.50]No, I can skip it.
[18:09.14]I can skip it.
[18:13.71]He had to do, like, the funny joke, but it's in real life.
[18:17.25]So it looks like... Why?
[18:21.03]Oh, I skipped the scream.
[18:22.19]It's alright.
[18:22.65]I lost bits.
[18:23.57]Lost bits.
[18:26.25]This game just wants me to scream, doesn't it?
[18:29.51]Thanks for the bits, guys.
[18:36.51]I'm the YouTuber streamer, and I have to find my bits when I die.
[18:40.79]Alright, is this where I fight an enemy here?
[18:46.39]At least one of these is gonna come alive.
[18:48.43]I don't have, like, a punch button.
[18:55.43]Press B to dodge.
[18:57.73]Oh.
[18:57.85]Okay, well, hold on.
[18:58.88]What's over here?
[18:59.36]Is there a run?
[19:02.70]I just wanna make sure I don't... Look, this is a Dark Souls game.
[19:06.64]Whoa.
[19:11.13]Cool.
[19:15.51]Alright, I don't think I can do anything else.
[19:19.68]Don't you know every one of these games has... Oh, go pick up the thing on the ground over there.
[19:23.68]And that's +2 Estus Flask charges.
[19:26.68]No.
[19:28.12]No.
[19:33.51]Okay.
[19:34.71]Got it.
[19:35.85]See, I told you, look.
[19:36.67]It even has the same exact color scheme.
[19:40.05]Save your progress with an obelisk.
[19:42.35]Forgotten bits.
[19:45.67]Alright, so every time I pick up bits in the game, you have to give them to me in the stream.
[19:51.83]Don't, I'm kidding.
[19:52.69]That's a fucking dumb joke.
[19:53.93]Don't do that.
[19:55.95]Big bits.
[19:59.27]So my bits counter is up there.
[20:01.03]That's only, I only have two dollars!
[20:04.94]I'm just going to keep going.
[20:13.83]Small strong box.
[20:16.21]Bit capsule, tiny.
[20:17.69]Small energy potion.
[20:21.17]So it says... Save your progress in the obelisk.
[20:26.18]Okay.
[20:27.58]That's an obelisk, I assume.
[20:29.36]Use the obelisk to equip weapon blueprints.
[20:33.39]Data unlocked.
[20:34.51]Prison guard pistol.
[20:36.76]Small ammo pack, small energy.
[20:39.06]Alright.
[20:40.96]Forgotten bits.
[20:43.92]I'm up to three dollars.
[20:45.38]How much money am I going to have by the end of this level, you think?
[20:52.64]I will give this streamer bits because it's a funny in-game joke.
[20:56.10]Oh, look at all the... Oh, cool, man!
[20:58.37]So we're up to... Okay, so thank you to... Hold on a minute.
[21:02.30]I hate that I'm doing this right now, but it's funny to me.
[21:07.52]Yeah, Lucky Dingo gave $2 and Free iPod gave a dollar here.
[21:12.28]Bake Me Home gave a dollar.
[21:13.46]No, excuse me.
[21:15.65]Do not give me more money than what is in the top right portion of the screen.
[21:19.73]You understand?
[21:22.47]Whatever that number is, that's what it is.
[21:24.75]Do not go higher than that.
[21:26.97]I absolutely, I command that.
[21:31.36]You are not allowed to exceed that number.
[21:37.70]See, and you've already done it.
[21:40.23]Now we're at $5.
[21:42.59]No, it's gonna be $3.
[21:45.07]So don't get, if I get $5, don't give any more money.
[21:48.85]No, stop doing that, stop it.
[21:50.97]No, now we're at like $8.
[21:53.49]Walking stick of rhubarb from Razzle2ape808, thanks for the $5.
[21:57.67]Eat poop.
[21:58.35]Alright, well, don't give, alright, it's already over.
[22:01.30]Now I... Don't tell me what to do.
[22:03.98]Thanks for the $14, Kip.
[22:07.10]Reverse psychology.
[22:08.36]Hold on.
[22:08.74]Wait, I didn't even look at the obelisk yet.
[22:12.74]Attributes, weapons... Okay.
[22:15.92]Like fucking 30 bucks and out.
[22:18.68]Jesus Christ.
[22:20.72]Come on!
[22:21.26]You're supposed to play along with that.
[22:22.88]I don't deserve the money unless I pick it up in the game.
[22:30.30]Thank you, guys.
[22:33.16]Alright, weapons.
[22:35.08]Weapon slot locked.
[22:36.62]I have a secondary weapon slot.
[22:39.92]Stop using reverse cycle.
[22:41.26]I'm not!
[22:41.80]I really wanted to not have more than three dolls.
[22:45.64]I'm serious.
[22:47.48]Prison guard.
[22:47.98]Equip, upgrade, or scrap.
[22:50.08]Alright, just make it.
[22:55.21]Change.
[22:56.95]Or upgrade.
[22:58.59]Equip.
[23:00.55]Okay, that's there.
[23:01.23]Alright, now attributes.
[23:03.81]Oh god, I gotta read this for a second.
[23:09.97]Okay, so Finesse's reload speed.
[23:14.93]So, perception is critical damage bonus.
[23:21.32]RPG elements.
[23:24.26]I mean, they got my attention so far.
[23:25.64]This has my, this game, I'm gonna give you some fair warning here.
[23:29.64]No, I'm not even gonna tell you.
[23:30.88]I'm not even gonna tell you.
[23:32.34]Why would I say that?
[23:34.13]No, we're going in with a fresh mindset here, okay?
[23:38.98]Perception is... Critical damage bonus.
[23:44.30]And it's required for precise weapons.
[23:45.88]Strength is melee weapon scaling.
[23:49.86]He was about to say that it sucks.
[23:54.42]That's not what I said.
[24:01.78]This is weapons.
[24:03.20]That's cool.
[24:03.84]Agility.
[24:04.36]Dodge skill.
[24:04.84]Increase the efficiency of your dodge roll.
[24:06.91]Make it easier to avoid attacks.
[24:09.41]Decrease the time it takes to use a medpack.
[24:11.11]Okay, well that's the most important thing so far.
[24:12.95]Where's health?
[24:14.55]Toughness is health.
[24:15.29]Oh, I have no health.
[24:17.25]So many people are giving money right now.
[24:20.95]Alright, so then my goal then... If I'm going to reverse psychology you guys, and then you guys are reverse psychology-ing me too...
[24:29.87]I have to get like 50,000 bits in the corner then.
[24:33.39]Or like 500,000 or something.
[24:39.96]So this is health and flinching reduction that's important.
[24:42.24]Endurance is stamina and stamina recovery.
[24:47.34]Expertise is just weapons scaling with standard weaponry.
[24:53.07]Now, if this is a true Dark Souls game, three of these are going to be useless and never put points into them.
[24:57.71]Which one are they?
[24:58.33]I don't know what they are.
[25:00.63]Special weapon scaling and energy.
[25:06.21]I'm gonna say agility and toughness.
[25:08.39]Agility, finesse, and toughness are probably the ones that I need to do.
[25:12.09]I don't know.
[25:12.82]Who fucking knows.
[25:15.54]I have a weapon now, though.
[25:18.78]How do I use it?
[25:20.18]Okay, like that.
[25:24.80]Share the wealth.
[25:25.66]Alright, so now...
[25:30.95]Fight enemies.
[25:33.69]Okay.
[25:34.95]Hold LT and aim and shoot.
[25:39.41]Alright.
[25:41.75]Is there a reload?
[25:51.70]Oh, God.
[25:54.80]There has to be.
[25:55.44]Where's the sprint, too?
[25:59.59]Hold A to re... There it is.
[26:01.57]Press A, not hold A. Something I'm noticing right now, guys.
[26:08.97]There's ammo.
[26:14.33]Headshots, too?
[26:14.89]Yeah, there's headshots.
[26:18.19]So what happens if you run out of ammo?
[26:19.22]Alright.
[26:22.26]Well, that was a lot.
[26:23.88]What do we have so far?
[26:24.84]Somebody keep track of the total for the stream.
[26:30.32]Share the bits or you're a scumbag.
[26:32.64]Wait, what?
[26:35.14]What are you talking about?
[26:37.22]What do you mean I'm a scumbag?
[26:39.32]What happened?
[26:44.94]Okay, there's ammo pack.
[26:49.58]Scumbag.
[26:50.44]Oh, you're a fucking scumbag, dude.
[26:54.23]Can I open this?
[26:55.11]No.
[26:57.85]Gift a sub or you're a scumbag.
[26:59.91]Look, I'm just trying to play the game right now.
[27:03.93]Press and hold the RB to charge a power attack.
[27:10.43]Oh.
[27:13.47]So it just, like, sprays funny gas.
[27:15.72]Okay.
[27:18.22]I just wasted that.
[27:23.06]You spray water at people.
[27:24.50]I wonder what it does.
[27:26.76]This guy looks hard.
[27:28.17]This looks like a hard part of the game.
[27:30.29]This is the first tutorial boss that determines if you should uninstall it or not.
[27:37.48]Alright, it's like a stun.
[27:38.36]I get it.
[27:59.45]Is there a lock on?
[28:00.57]There is.
[28:01.07]Okay.
[28:04.63]Why would I shoot him here?
[28:06.47]Can I swing anything?
[28:10.01]I'm going to use all my bullets on this guy.
[28:13.55]Is there like a backshot?
[28:15.59]Like a backstab?
[28:18.67]I don't have any more...
[28:28.56]I probably shouldn't be using a controller either now that I think about this.
[28:34.92]Shoot him in the feet.
[28:36.40]Oh, right in the back.
[28:38.64]Okay.
[28:40.54]Gift subs.
[28:41.22]Oh, Jesus.
[28:41.82]Somebody gave a lot of subs.
[28:47.35]Ow.
[28:50.99]Okay, I got him right in the back.
[28:58.88]Okay, there it is.
[29:00.18]Oh, that's a thou... Thank you for the $10 game.
[29:02.26]Appreciate it, man.
[29:04.65]Thank you so much for the $10.
[29:05.65]Appreciate it.
[29:11.85]Pretty big bits from enemy number three.
[29:16.10]Chunky Baloney.
[29:18.18]Thank you for the five gifted subs here, Chunky Baloney.
[29:24.00]Welcome back.
[29:27.03]Give me compliments.
[29:28.05]Give them now.
[29:28.61]Give me compliments.
[29:30.15]Yes, this is Dark Souls with guns.
[29:31.67]Yes.
[29:33.11]I was waiting to drop that on you guys.
[29:35.25]I was waiting to hold off on that until, you know, you saw it.
[29:37.97]And it was like, what the fuck, Wolf PogChamp?
[29:41.97]That's the secret.
[29:43.15]That's the secret there.
[29:53.60]I wish there was a sprint.
[29:57.84]I'm almost out of ammo.
[30:00.12]Do I have to craft ammo?
[30:09.95]This thing is moving.
[30:11.93]Armor Shrine.
[30:12.63]Okay, hold on.
[30:16.37]Rogue Insider Serum Decree.
[30:19.52]An advanced scavenger kit.
[30:21.48]Armor Shrine.
[30:23.56]Increases medpack capacity to four.
[30:27.29]Oh, so that's the Estus Flask.
[30:30.85]Stop breathing into the mic.
[30:33.80]I'm not breathing into the mic.
[30:41.14]Bits in chat.
[30:45.58]Where?
[30:48.60]I need ammo.
[30:52.22]I can hear it.
[30:52.86]That's the video game, guys.
[30:58.32]Use item.
[30:59.42]Lever.
[31:00.21]So, hold on.
[31:00.79]Is this like a... You have to use items to open doors?
[31:03.17]Okay.
[31:13.28]Currently I have $18.50.
[31:13.68]Alright, there's a couple ways to go.
[31:19.24]First, let's open this.
[31:24.97]Every room in this game looks the same.
[31:26.33]I mean, but where... This is the tutorial, though.
[31:29.63]This is the, hey, this is teaching you how to play the game.
[31:32.10]How do you feel about that?
[31:34.18]Not you, me.
[31:43.36]What?
[31:43.74]Come on.
[31:49.79]Oh, this is the room I was in before.
[31:50.99]Okay.
[31:52.77]So that was just a shortcut.
[31:59.70]Going backwards.
[32:01.08]I just needed to see!
[32:05.46]So that, this is the shortcut to here.
[32:09.38]So is there anything else that I didn't do in these rooms?
[32:10.94]I kind of want to go save your, yeah, I want to go get the other weapon.
[32:14.54]All I have is a secondary right now.
[32:19.95]Here we go.
[32:20.37]Primary weapon slot.
[32:22.33]Rogue Insider.
[32:25.05]Put it on.
[32:27.87]Anyway, now I got new attributes.
[32:30.72]Okay, how many, what do I have of points?
[32:34.12]Level 1, it costs 1500.
[32:35.92]Oh, it costs money!
[32:38.43]Shit, it costs money to do this.
[32:40.97]I don't want to use my bits.
[32:47.39]Fuck, it's 1500 bits!
[32:48.76]Don't worry, we'll just give you more.
[33:00.88]I think I want to increase my health a little bit here.
[33:03.69]Five sounds very low.
[33:06.67]Do you reject or confirm the donation?
[33:08.53]I confirm the toughness donation.
[33:10.33]I want a little bit more health.
[33:12.11]Six I feel like is tiny.
[33:16.45]And now I actually have a weapon.
[33:19.21]Okay, it's up.
[33:20.49]You just up or down.
[33:23.11]I get it.
[33:24.49]I get it.
[33:24.93]Are you guys getting it yet?
[33:26.21]Have you figured it out yet?
[33:27.10]I figured it out.
[33:28.70]The bonfires in this game just refill your ammo.
[33:31.34]There is no ammo.
[33:39.06]I want to go home.
[33:41.90]Somebody said no.
[33:45.77]Can you explain it again?
[33:47.29]Yeah.
[33:47.67]So the bonfires, when you touch them, the obelisks, they refill your ammo.
[33:57.87]I hear... I hear, like, the lickers.
[34:04.10]One more time, I didn't hear you.
[34:05.32]Oh, sorry.
[34:06.02]I'll try to say it a little louder this time.
[34:07.36]See their backs?
[34:13.53]Look at that guy's back.
[34:14.33]He's got, like, a tap light on his back.
[34:17.83]They have guns, too!
[34:18.57]Wait, that's not fair!
[34:24.66]Since when?
[34:26.18]I'm the only guy that's supposed to have a gun.
[34:34.85]Uh, JatootyJabooty, thank you for the gifted sub there.
[34:40.03]Thank you, dude.
[34:40.41]Don't worry, we'll give you more bits.
[34:44.07]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[34:47.56]I'm afraid about this guy.
[34:48.46]No, this guy's dead.
[34:49.70]He ain't standing up.
[34:53.96]What is the sprint button?
[34:57.66]100 bits.
[34:59.68]Let's go the other way.
[35:02.87]I don't know.
[35:03.49]I just took, like, a healing item.
[35:04.89]God damn it.
[35:06.31]I'm trying to, like, figure out what the sprint button is.
[35:10.43]Let me go refill that.
[35:14.99]Left... Okay, there it is.
[35:19.55]It's L3.
[35:19.81]L3.
[35:27.68]Was that Obelisk?
[35:28.96]Did I fucking pass it?
[35:33.66]Who the hell is this thing?
[35:37.26]There it is.
[35:38.82]Missed shotgun.
[35:45.23]Alright, that's good.
[35:45.85]Let's go.
[35:49.13]I wish there was a jump, too.
[35:50.07]I feel like I'm changing something when I hit R3.
[35:55.10]I missed the legendary shotgun.
[35:56.36]That's too bad.
[35:57.75]I don't want the legendary shotgun.
[36:09.25]I'm wasting so much ammo.
[36:11.01]Hey!
[36:16.89]I just gotta get behind you.
[36:19.15]You're blocking the goddamn door, really.
[36:22.53]I'm gonna die.
[36:33.43]I'm just gonna hold the button down.
[36:34.69]That's what I would do in this situation.
[36:40.65]That's what I... That's what we do in this situation.
[36:42.37]We hold the button down and we spray.
[36:44.97]Who cares about finesse?
[36:45.83]I don't need it.
[36:46.49]Alright, slow down.
[36:54.45]First, why do you use your consumables like syringes and grenades?
[36:57.59]Oh, that's how you switch.
[36:58.93]That's gonna get kind of hard to get used to.
[37:02.99]Oh, it's not.
[37:03.61]Stop lying to make it seem like the game's harder than it is.
[37:07.59]Oh, that's gonna take a little bit of time getting used to, man.
[37:09.35]I'm not used to that.
[37:10.21]Hmm.
[37:10.71]How do I do it?
[37:11.51]Right?
[37:17.83]Chat spams Jupiter when they're bored.
[37:19.73]You know, this is... Hold, just wait a minute.
[37:21.81]Wait till I get to the first Asylum Demon boss.
[37:26.93]And you guys are gonna be like, holy fuck, that guy's huge!
[37:29.10]And I'm gonna be like, I know, man.
[37:30.44]And I'm gonna stand up and flex.
[37:33.35]Okay, I got a melee weapon.
[37:38.85]Melee weapon slot.
[37:40.55]I have an heirloom axe.
[37:43.45]Okay.
[37:46.94]And we can level up again.
[37:47.76]Alright, now a finesse reload speed.
[37:58.50]I feel like I'm making a lot of initial mistakes.
[38:01.74]But I think we're just going to go with toughness again.
[38:05.64]Let's get this to 15.
[38:06.33]That's good.
[38:10.33]16 bucks.
[38:13.23]So how do I use this now?
[38:17.37]Is it just like square?
[38:18.21]L1, R1?
[38:20.05]Nope.
[38:20.71]X. Okay.
[38:29.11]So that's kind of cool, actually.
[38:30.23]Hmm.
[38:33.67]ResidentSleeper.
[38:35.02]Hey, just wait till the huge guy shows up in this game and you go, whoa, that was fun.
[38:46.20]My face when I am chat complaining about game and playing Fortnite on other monitor.
[38:56.69]How good is the melee?
[39:00.46]That's how we spray!
[39:03.22]This melee's actually not that bad.
[39:12.34]Alright.
[39:13.60]Melee's not bad.
[39:16.84]Fortnite on other monitor.
[39:19.64]How many monitors do you have?
[39:20.86]I don't know about you guys, but I need a separate monitor for every window.
[39:27.88]I got Reddit on a monitor, I have the game on a monitor, I have chat on a monitor, I have Streamlabs on a monitor.
[39:33.85]I have... I have Fortnite on my other monitor over here, I'm a big fan.
[39:38.73]Oh god.
[39:39.11]I gotta sprint through this.
[39:45.95]Why don't I have a... Oh yeah, you got me Dark Souls.
[39:49.07]You got me Dark Souls.
[39:55.74]I had to.
[39:56.64]I had to do it.
[39:57.48]I just wasted a lot of ammo, but I had to do it.
[40:03.89]Oh, that face went... What?
[40:09.95]He swings three times.
[40:16.74]Stop wasting ammo.
[40:17.84]I'm gonna die to the boss because I can't shoot anything.
[40:27.09]Whoa, is there a sneak?
[40:29.05]I don't think this is a sneak.
[40:42.94]What about... What does this have for a super move?
[40:51.76]Is this game better than Dark Souls?
[40:54.62]Um...
[41:10.30]I wonder how many double-fisted slams into the keyboard with... What the?
[41:15.22]Like, somebody screaming the word, fuck.
[41:17.84]Or idiot or something.
[41:21.14]Just happened.
[41:21.56]How many people are here?
[41:22.56]There's like 2100 people here.
[41:24.73]At least a hundred of you just slammed both your hands on him, which is angry.
[41:27.33]I'm like, fucking idiot.
[41:29.88]Alright, here comes the boss.
[41:35.92]Yeah, big open room.
[41:37.20]It's going to be the Asylum Demon, and it's going to be embarrassing when I die.
[41:39.68]There he is.
[41:42.13]He's got a Tommy gun.
[41:49.57]I heard something.
[41:54.14]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[41:57.54]House Carl invader.
[42:00.69]He sprays.
[42:01.25]Let's see what he does.
[42:03.73]Wow.
[42:04.25]Ow, that hurts.
[42:04.85]Okay, not a very much.
[42:12.06]Jesus Christ.
[42:13.18]I have to shoot him in the back.
[42:15.60]Oh, my fucking God.
[42:16.66]He's destroying me.
[42:28.42]He reloads, he reloads!
[42:29.78]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[42:30.94]Jeremy, I get it.
[42:34.38]No, what the fuck are you doing?
[42:36.14]I hit the wrong button.
[42:37.96]I'm trying to reload.
[42:39.00]Reload is A. This is gonna take some getting used to.
[42:44.34]I'm dead.
[42:52.60]Why is my Comcast falling?
[42:55.56]Why are we failing?
[43:03.70]Can you reload?
[43:08.34]Alright, hold on.
[43:19.19]Jesus Christ!
[43:31.76]He just, he just, oh my god.
[43:34.56]That was fucking stupid.
[43:35.84]His, he didn't even do like an animation.
[43:39.81]He just went like... He just gotta get to the boss room.
[43:47.37]Like every other Souls game, right?
[43:52.18]Ow.
[43:53.24]Oh, fuck.
[44:04.21]Died to House Carl.
[44:07.83]Why does his name have to be so fucking stupid?
[44:11.80]Look, you have to die to the first boss.
[44:20.14]Holy shit, I can't believe this guy died to House Carl.
[44:25.74]Don't go that fast.
[44:29.84]I gotta get my bits back.
[44:30.88]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to.
[44:35.82]He's not dead.
[44:36.28]I wonder if I should try to get around the guy and hit him in the back.
[44:44.47]Alright, let's go house Carl.
[44:46.15]Part 2.
[44:46.49]Oh, is there no skip or something to this boss?
[45:03.75]I feel like there should be a skip here.
[45:09.19]Right?
[45:11.29]There's not.
[45:12.43]Maybe there is.
[45:16.16]Still on... Oh, he's still on House Carl.
[45:18.98]Let's go, Carl!
[45:21.66]Oh, fuck.
[45:22.28]Can I... No, don't do it!
[45:29.55]I just got in here!
[45:33.52]Oh my god!
[45:37.88]It's so hard to predict it!
[45:50.65]Come over here.
[45:53.25]I don't understand the invincibility frame.
[45:57.70]It feels like it doesn't work.
[46:07.50]There we go.
[46:13.46]I have to play with mouse and keyboard.
[46:15.40]You see what I'm talking about?
[46:16.12]Like, what the fuck is that hitbox?
[46:17.84]What?
[46:20.06]That's, like, impossible to know when to dodge that.
[46:22.35]What the hell was that?
[46:23.71]What?
[46:35.23]You have to just stay really far away.
[46:36.95]That's all there is to it.
[46:38.62]God damn it.
[46:41.08]Here he goes with the relive again.
[46:43.50]Alright, this guy just became incredibly easy.
[46:51.42]I just can't get hit again, but I will.
[46:56.73]You have to wait until he goes like...
[47:15.18]Come on, do it again.
[47:21.84]That's why it was so hard to dodge, because it was, like, just odd.
[47:24.34]Ah, he's in the corner.
[47:27.53]That's... God damn it.
[47:28.57]Bad place.
[47:34.11]He can't do it in the corner.
[47:41.19]Oh, House Carl, you fucking asshole, really.
[47:43.05]Alright, I beat House Carl.
[47:53.10]I didn't die to House Carl again.
[47:59.74]Carl down.
[48:06.07]Alright, it is a shotgun, except I can't even use it.
[48:10.15]TRM syringe.
[48:11.37]Where's my bits from... Alright, look at my health.
[48:14.57]This is bad.
[48:20.41]Killed house invader Carl.
[48:22.11]Is that what his name was?
[48:30.36]The door is currently locked.
[48:33.18]What?
[48:33.34]What?
[48:38.23]Uh... So what?
[48:40.41]I don't even get, like, an enemy vanquished?
[48:42.71]Here's a full health bar?
[48:43.55]Are you serious?
[48:57.38]Oh, okay.
[48:58.36]I was gonna say, what?
[49:03.61]I'm currently dropping frames.
[49:04.77]It should be okay.
[49:06.55]Just give it a second.
[49:13.09]alright well that was look out the window charlie look outside that's everything this will be yours I knew that joke was coming
[49:48.49]It is the real boss.
[49:51.35]I'm in the house that Carl was invading.
[50:07.92]Um, I don't like having this little health.
[50:10.44]Can I have a health pack?
[50:12.92]Can I craft a health pack?
[50:16.78]What if one of those bullets just like, right in his face?
[50:20.71]This is actually the real boss fight?
[50:24.77]I have no HP.
[50:29.49]Guys, I have brand new thermometer amount of health.
[50:33.80]Like, I have thermometer not placed in mouth, is what I have.
[50:37.63]I need twelve cerium.
[50:41.45]I only have one cerium?
[50:52.84]I guess I... What's he doing?
[50:58.82]Oh.
[50:59.20]Well, I can't.
[51:00.08]I can't.
[51:00.58]What's his name?
[51:01.06]What's the guy from Diablo 3 that has... What's his name?
[51:02.96]The guy that's like... The guy that laughs at you the whole time.
[51:06.45]He makes fun of you the whole time in the second act.
[51:08.25]What's that guy's name?
[51:10.11]Zordon?
[51:12.43]What am I supposed to do about this?
[51:15.68]Was there a cutscene that I was supposed to play?
[51:19.30]Oh.
[51:19.64]Okay.
[51:20.14]Yes.
[51:21.72]Why am I so small?
[51:32.64]I looked like such a big warrior.
[51:36.54]You live.
[51:37.92]There is yet a chance to reverse this.
[51:40.98]Do not be alarmed if you have no recollection.
[51:45.03]The detention affects the mind.
[51:48.03]As such, you stand within Grand Hall, the only sanctuary remaining.
[51:54.57]But that, too, is in jeopardy.
[51:58.20]The undead are unrelenting.
[52:01.33]As the monolith weakens, so does our protective shield.
[52:05.83]We face a grave threat.
[52:09.00]You seem to be our last hope.
[52:12.72]So... And look, you can't dog an indie game developer for doing this.
[52:19.22]But lip-syncing, it's very... When you do the dead fish, or you do the fish out of water, the open, open, open, open, open... That's fish out of water lip-syncing.
[52:29.62]That's what it's called.
[52:30.44]And I just called it that, so that's what it's called now.
[52:35.98]Alright, so... What do I have to do?
[52:41.44]Talk to the monolith.
[52:43.79]Hold on.
[52:45.03]Was there something else over here that I could do?
[52:46.97]There's like a portal over here.
[52:49.49]No, never mind.
[52:50.05]It's just an interesting asset.
[52:52.43]Alright, we're gonna talk to the door.
[52:59.37]I hope this thing has a really high-pitched funny voice.
[53:01.35]No.
[53:06.02]No.
[53:11.97]The great monolith revealed itself.
[53:16.70]Born from this was the stream.
[53:19.68]The stream.
[53:20.52]Flowing, binding, and creating the cosmos and all within it.
[53:24.32]Bits, stream.
[53:26.86]Stars and planets formed.
[53:30.81]And life followed.
[53:31.91]There's the planets.
[53:38.21]This was the dawn of all races.
[53:43.56]This is how the planet emojis were formed.
[53:45.73]But as the first children of the Monolith explored the power of the stream, their worlds collided.
[53:52.39]Oh no.
[54:01.43]Ultimately, one race would strive for power.
[54:06.89]They were the Prime.
[54:08.58]The Twitch Prime.
[54:09.28]And the instigators of the Prime-Azurian War.
[54:13.75]With their victory, the Prime claimed the core, and with it, the home of the Monolith.
[54:21.09]So that's you, then.
[54:21.89]It bestowed great power unto them and gave them dominion over all life.
[54:27.01]That's Twitch Prime versus Plebs.
[54:29.24]Great cities were built.
[54:31.00]Technological advancements in trade allowed the worlds to flourish and bloom.
[54:36.93]And thus, the golden age began.
[54:39.69]Somebody just wrote that.
[54:41.09]That's fucking funny.
[54:41.76]This was the time of heroes, where legends were born and their stories told.
[54:48.22]And so it was for eons.
[54:52.80]But this was not to last.
[54:55.40]I am turbo.
[54:58.74]An evil is spreading through the cosmos.
[55:03.03]Uh-oh.
[55:03.47]We gotta go from planet to planet.
[55:13.02]That looks pretty evil, I think.
[55:24.59]The big evil planet.
[55:32.61]Okay.
[55:36.13]What's the evil?
[55:42.76]That's a lot of dead air.
[55:44.30]We need some, uh, we need some filler there.
[55:46.36]Hello world, I got the achievement.
[55:52.02]He had a lot of really cool, interesting dialog lines, and then he just blew it all out too quickly and was, oh shit, I said a lot of cool things.
[56:01.15]I have a connection with the monolith now.
[56:03.51]Now let's fucking backstab him.
[56:06.91]Alright, what do you got?
[56:07.49]Before you stands the Monolith.
[56:10.79]Keeper of the cosmos.
[56:12.47]You can't shoot it.
[56:12.93]Anchor of reality.
[56:15.47]I am its steward.
[56:17.17]We have much to discuss.
[56:19.03]Yes, whenever you say, steward... Be grateful that the Monolith has accepted you.
[56:25.28]This is not something granted lightly.
[56:29.60]Alright, so I'm just going to... Whatever.
[56:36.24]Is he yelling at me?
[56:40.33]I have to talk to you now?
[56:42.11]Wait, you didn't really get that upset when I ran away from him?
[56:47.59]The end nears.
[56:49.63]The light of many worlds is fading.
[56:52.79]Don't you walk away from me.
[56:54.39]The end has come.
[56:56.61]Necessity demands this.
[56:59.25]However, there is an evil that must be stopped.
[57:06.40]Did he give up?
[57:07.38]I think he gave up.
[57:11.54]I'm gonna go and like... What's her name?
[57:15.60]I don't even know what Disney characters... There's so many Disney characters, it's hard to remember who had the mirror that they could talk to.
[57:19.84]Ooh!
[57:21.74]Ooh!
[57:24.48]Do you hear me?
[57:26.28]Now he's talking through... He's talking through my headset.
[57:29.27]The pathway between the core and your position is stable.
[57:33.11]All the gateways allow you free return.
[57:37.69]Transmission stability will vary.
[57:40.73]That communication will be only intermittent.
[57:44.58]Welcome to the Primordial Realm.
[57:48.16]This guy won't leave me alone, will he?
[57:51.10]It is void of life, but not death.
[57:55.96]Find the Nexus Orb.
[57:57.74]Take heed, Waytread.
[58:00.00]We're in Arden, Scar of the Abyss.
[58:04.30]The Ninth Realm with its signs?
[58:06.64]The Cradle of Unlife, unsought destination for all mortal souls.
[58:09.78]The Realm of Death was carved into the bowels of an abandoned world by the Queen of Dead herself.
[58:17.60]Where's my tour guide?
[58:18.52]Alright, let's check down here.
[58:19.42]There's always a thing.
[58:21.14]There's always a little mini ledge that has an enemy at the end of it that you're going to fall off the edge.
[58:24.77]Be careful, but there's an item at the end.
[58:26.59]Touch it and grab it.
[58:29.83]Now there's a ladder.
[58:34.71]Kick down.
[58:35.69]Climb down.
[58:36.17]And there we go.
[58:42.47]Small energy potion and a bit capsule.
[58:44.63]Small.
[58:49.71]There's loot down there.
[58:53.69]There's bits down there, too.
[58:55.07]Alright, that's fine.
[59:01.75]So you go through a series of Mario paintings, like somebody said.
[59:04.92]That's true.
[59:05.38]That's a good way to put it.
[59:08.42]We gotta take it slow, though.
[59:09.40]This is not just a run-and-shoot-and-run-around game.
[59:12.00]You gotta be careful.
[59:15.58]Gotta check every corner.
[59:16.56]Gonna make sure I don't miss anything.
[59:20.15]There's an obelisk crush.
[59:22.13]Alright, what we got?
[59:23.29]Weapons.
[59:26.05]Show info.
[59:27.37]Power attack.
[59:28.25]Fires a strong burst while dashing away from the target.
[59:30.44]It's just Space Odyssey.
[59:35.78]So that is a silenced shotgun.
[59:38.94]I can't even use this.
[59:42.30]It requires 14 small rabbits.
[59:45.52]I don't know what that is.
[59:46.98]I think that's strength.
[59:49.80]So I can't do it.
[59:50.62]Can I just scrap it?
[59:51.76]I'm never going to have 14 small rabbits.
[59:57.68]You receive 250 bits, two components.
[59:59.84]You receive one automated stability controller.
[60:04.12]Yeah.
[60:05.46]I'm not going to put points into that.
[60:10.22]Yeah, strength.
[60:11.18]I needed to double my strength and then some to be able to put that on.
[60:14.76]I don't have any strength.
[60:16.79]What do you mean?
[60:17.33]That was a waste.
[60:18.15]No, it wasn't.
[60:20.05]Nobody said it was a waste, but that's what I'm hearing.
[60:23.01]Alright, here's an NPC.
[60:26.75]Alright, is this like in Dark Souls where NPCs can, like, die?
[60:51.64]Okay.
[60:54.08]Thanks for the pendant.
[60:57.44]Oh, hold on, hold on.
[61:05.85]We didn't even get one sentence.
[61:08.31]Wait, wait, but that's an item, though.
[61:09.93]I got the pendant.
[61:16.45]What did I get?
[61:18.69]Aspects.
[61:19.37]Agony.
[61:25.61]Do I have, like, an inventory?
[61:26.69]Alright, well, whatever.
[61:33.77]It's fine.
[61:42.14]I'm trying to- Okay, that was gross.
[61:43.60]I'm trying to, like, respectfully have her go off the cliff.
[61:51.58]What- Watch that be an incredibly important NPC.
[61:57.90]Wait, I can level up.
[62:01.56]Why is inventory?
[62:02.56]No, it's not.
[62:02.94]Why is healing?
[62:06.10]I need 1,800.
[62:06.84]I gotta kill, like, one thing here.
[62:10.46]Let's snipe somebody and then run away.
[62:12.40]Wait, I have bit capsules.
[62:13.56]Where's my inventory?
[62:19.55]Right?
[62:19.79]Like, where are these bit capsules going?
[62:21.25]That's not a bit capsule.
[62:22.71]I have, like, four of them.
[62:25.89]There it is.
[62:26.39]Okay.
[62:27.51]Select.
[62:29.43]Heat patch.
[62:29.99]First designed to withstand the fiery heat of Bogar.
[62:32.87]These patches increase heat resistance.
[62:36.11]Okay.
[62:37.43]Where was it?
[62:38.47]It was called Warden's Pendant.
[62:41.57]A beautifully crafted pendant, a reminder of forgotten accomplishments.
[62:47.25]Alright, I'm not... I can't... I'm going to have to use this at some point.
[62:49.57]Bit capsules, yeah.
[62:53.97]This is all foreign language to me.
[62:55.81]I don't even know what the fuck that means.
[62:56.83]Alright, let's go to bit capsule.
[63:01.85]Let's crush it.
[63:05.73]Alright, here we go.
[63:08.33]250 bits.
[63:08.59]Thanks, guys.
[63:12.10]I'm going to say... Put on the Doom soundtrack.
[63:18.00]I'm not going to put on the Doom soundtrack.
[63:19.46]Let's do toughness.
[63:20.66]Having this little health is actually kind of scaring me.
[63:29.12]I would say I'll feel comfortable with that at 8 or 9 or 10.
[63:37.48]Do it.
[63:38.06]Put on any background music.
[63:39.60]I think if the background music... I could turn it here.
[63:56.55]Don't even... whatever.
[64:00.09]It has to be.
[64:00.69]I'm using a controller.
[64:07.27]It's only on when I auto-lock.
[64:09.21]Guys, you want to talk shit about aim assist?
[64:11.33]Hold on a second here.
[64:12.71]Back up.
[64:13.63]Slowly move away for a second.
[64:16.11]When you auto-lock onto people, when you press R3 in Dark Souls, what's that called?
[64:23.23]How come you just don't play the game only with no targeting?
[64:28.41]That's called assisting your aim, isn't it?
[64:31.41]It's locking on.
[64:32.37]What is locking on?
[64:37.68]That is aim assist for melee.
[64:43.02]It's assisting you in aiming on somebody's body.
[64:47.05]So, excuse me.
[64:51.83]You don't have to aim a sword?
[64:53.07]Yes, you do.
[64:53.59]How are you supposed to hit him in the limb?
[65:06.02]I've got a controller on.
[65:08.18]I like playing these types of third-person games with a controller.
[65:10.60]I don't like using a keyboard and mouse.
[65:12.85]So that's the... Ooh, a Legion sidearm.
[65:15.11]Ooh.
[65:16.89]Ooh.
[65:17.33]Ooh, Pale Crystal.
[65:18.35]I don't know what that means.
[65:22.05]I kind of want to go look at that.
[65:27.22]Dirt, he's a clicker.
[65:32.84]Is it better than what I have?
[65:33.72]Prison Guard Pistol.
[65:36.67]There we go.
[65:38.39]Alright, so this has less ammo, but more damage, more crit bonus, and more stability damage.
[65:44.93]Uh, yeah.
[65:46.65]Let's fucking destroy this one.
[65:54.97]Cool.
[65:56.71]Let's just shoot it once or twice.
[65:57.93]It's like an acid.
[66:03.13]It's... Wait.
[66:03.59]What?
[66:06.43]What epic gamer moment?
[66:09.25]I didn't do any epic gamer moments yet.
[66:10.96]It's okay.
[66:18.20]Alright, we got verticality here.
[66:20.94]I can't open these.
[66:22.57]I don't understand.
[66:23.49]Why are those demon doors in the game?
[66:26.49]I'm too far away.
[66:27.17]I can't shoot that guy.
[66:28.17]Well, that was a mistake.
[66:30.15]Oh well.
[66:31.07]Kick that ladder down for a shortcut later.
[66:32.79]Guaranteed.
[66:41.70]Overload!
[66:47.83]Is this poison?
[66:48.43]If I set this, is it going to hurt?
[66:50.67]Excuse me, don't you think about it.
[66:52.01]Don't you think about it.
[66:53.09]I mean, you can think about it, but just don't act on it.
[66:55.47]Don't do it.
[66:57.37]You can think about shooting that at me, but just don't.
[66:59.34]Please.
[67:03.50]Ooh!
[67:04.24]That does a lot of damage.
[67:09.82]I gotta get closer.
[67:14.96]Just stam- no, it's fine.
[67:16.18]It's not even poisonous.
[67:20.31]He's out of stamina.
[67:27.67]That's a lot of damage.
[67:29.87]It was.
[67:35.51]Let's keep going up top here.
[67:37.58]Forgotten bits.
[67:41.19]I'm gonna wrap around, I think.
[67:47.77]Memes.
[67:48.31]Feels good, man.
[67:51.04]What do they say it like?
[67:51.88]Yeah, that guy has the... I'm gonna get an energy shield here.
[67:54.74]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[67:57.28]Oh, fuck!
[67:58.12]What the hell was that?
[67:58.96]That guy just threw a grenade!
[68:00.26]I didn't know they had grenades.
[68:10.58]What's over here?
[68:12.18]An idol.
[68:13.36]The wayward woman.
[68:14.14]I wonder what these things do.
[68:18.94]Is this really a Souls game or is that a joke?
[68:20.72]No, that's real.
[68:21.80]That's really happening.
[68:22.62]That's for real.
[68:29.56]That was not me making a little reference or a little joke.
[68:32.10]That's actually real.
[68:37.06]I'm running out of ammo, though.
[68:39.63]It's just Dark Souls with guns.
[68:40.71]That's it.
[68:40.99]That's the only difference.
[68:43.03]But, um, hold on a second here, though.
[68:46.09]Oh.
[68:48.43]I don't hate this.
[68:50.21]Wait, there's no pausing!
[68:51.03]I forgot this is a start.
[68:55.15]I'm out of ammo.
[68:58.15]Okay, I'm out of ammo.
[69:01.09]What about the surge?
[69:01.71]This, okay, I'll tell you, this is way better than the surge.
[69:06.06]If you want to put the Surge and this together and say, hey, you know, side to side, which one's better?
[69:10.32]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:11.04]I would kick the Surge.
[69:13.40]Like, cleanly out of your left hand.
[69:16.32]Just like karate, like side, like... You wouldn't even know what happened.
[69:33.76]Surge is triple A.
[69:36.15]Surge is not triple A. Surge is double A. Did I miss anything?
[69:50.16]I could go level up, but hold on.
[69:51.22]I'm not done looking at stuff.
[69:55.18]Does this hurt?
[69:58.20]Fine, I'll level up.
[70:03.61]Hmm, maybe not.
[70:06.45]Everything is green in the game.
[70:12.38]Oh, fuck.
[70:16.36]Ah, grenade!
[70:16.79]I think he just did that to himself.
[70:24.95]I didn't like the dodge in the Surge because it wouldn't read, so I almost just got spiked.
[70:33.31]No, the Surge to me just felt like too human, but like a Dark Souls clone.
[70:36.89]And too human is awful.
[70:38.29]I couldn't get it out of my brain.
[70:40.88]If you ever played too human, the Surge was too human.
[70:48.72]Actually, I'm going to level up.
[70:50.30]I'm going to kick this guy.
[71:07.40]Is that the game where you stand on a bridge for ages as it fires across, flies across a chasm?
[71:12.52]Yeah, it's the game that Silicon Knights made.
[71:15.04]And they sued, they sued Epic Games about like, oh, we didn't get the support we needed.
[71:20.54]Fuck you, I want every single, if you look up what happened with Silicon Knights, it's actually kind of funny.
[71:25.55]They wanted like all profits from Epic Games.
[71:29.42]Because, like, Unreal was, like, fucked up for them.
[71:32.62]By the way, that lawsuit was dropped, and then they ended up getting countersued, and they had to pay millions of dollars to Epic Games.
[71:40.79]That's, like, the sad part about that.
[71:42.39]I want to get this to 8.
[71:49.75]How many scummy devs have sued Epic?
[71:51.92]I don't know.
[71:53.70]Probably a lot.
[72:06.94]But we'll see.
[72:07.44]I'll tell you one thing.
[72:09.48]The Surge... As much as I give shit to the Surge... The Surge did have an interesting level concept.
[72:15.83]They had interesting level designs.
[72:21.95]The animations were great.
[72:32.24]But I did not like that game.
[72:34.04]And I will not pretend to like that game.
[72:40.46]No, I need to go up here.
[72:46.28]Up the stairs and to the left.
[72:47.46]Remember this.
[72:47.89]Somebody remember this, because I'm not going to remember it.
[72:49.47]I thought you didn't need lock on.
[73:00.79]Don't.
[73:01.49]See?
[73:01.89]I don't need it.
[73:03.17]It's just easier with it on.
[73:08.63]I should go this way first.
[73:12.13]I think what's really throwing a lot of you guys off is my guy's red.
[73:15.14]With green hair.
[73:16.26]I think that's throwing you guys off.
[73:27.48]One guy.
[73:29.90]Oh no!
[73:30.54]Holy fuck, that's so much fall damage for his ball, as far as that was.
[73:35.01]Okay, good to know.
[73:36.41]Jesus.
[73:40.40]Am I made out of cinder blocks?
[73:41.56]What the hell was that?
[73:42.42]Let's go over here.
[73:56.67]Fuck.
[73:58.81]Dammit.
[74:00.19]Don't throw a grenade.
[74:05.05]Can't aim over there at the wraparound what the name of God is what the fuck is happening?
[74:11.15]What were those the spikes that killed me?
[74:13.61]I tell all this game is worse than the surge I'm kidding.
[74:25.80]I'm kidding.
[74:26.22]I'm kidding
[74:31.35]This truth comes out.
[74:35.07]No, no, it's not.
[74:39.75]Bad va- No, I'm not even mad.
[74:41.25]This is- I'm being challenged right now.
[74:43.03]My gamer skills are being challenged.
[74:52.82]The guy's up top to throw grenades and there's spikes over here.
[75:00.48]This guy has got to go.
[75:03.42]He's too far away for me to hurt him.
[75:04.56]See what I'm talking about?
[75:06.63]What the hell?
[75:07.19]Somebody just threw a grenade on the bottom of these stairs here.
[75:16.85]Here it comes again.
[75:21.49]Come on, die.
[75:25.56]What in the name of happened to me?
[75:27.66]What?
[75:29.72]Huh?
[75:31.58]I dodged boys!
[75:44.60]Fair and balanced.
[75:45.80]Alright, that was odd.
[75:46.64]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[75:48.34]Don't judge the game by the cover of its front cover.
[75:53.14]You know what I'm saying?
[75:55.30]Don't judge the book by the front cover.
[75:59.42]How does that saying go?
[76:05.03]Don't judge a book by its cover.
[76:06.69]There.
[76:10.69]It's hard to talk when you're dodged.
[76:12.09]Where did I get a scarf?
[76:15.23]This isn't the front cover.
[76:16.17]Yes, it is.
[76:22.57]We haven't even got into the game yet.
[76:29.98]The front cover is the game's title.
[76:31.78]No, the front cover is the Steam store page.
[76:33.90]There's the obelisk.
[76:35.84]I found it.
[76:41.78]Don't you guys know?
[76:42.34]Don't judge a book by the cover in the first three chapters.
[76:44.78]You have to... Look, if you were going to judge a book by the first four chapters, Harry Potter would have never been a success.
[76:51.11]The first five chapters of Harry Potter is awful.
[76:58.52]Okay.
[76:59.08]I don't think I can do... Any new melee weapons?
[77:08.23]No, this is fine.
[77:09.75]Alright, so I got the obelisk down here.
[77:15.69]Is this our big car- this- this- do you die if you go in water?
[77:19.42]The answer is absolutely yes.
[77:20.68]Why do I even need to test that?
[77:23.54]So we got this here.
[77:25.92]Harry Potter is terrible from start to finish.
[77:28.77]No, it's not.
[77:33.51]Why would you say that?
[77:40.46]How do I get over there?
[77:45.40]It's mostly terrible?
[77:46.64]No, it's not.
[77:49.84]Harry Potter is a good story.
[77:53.30]The only thing bad about Harry Potter are the seven books.
[77:59.29]Damn it.
[78:00.29]I don't like this feature.
[78:01.45]I can't do anything unless I have a certain amount of cerium decree.
[78:10.12]Ah, wait a minute.
[78:10.60]Here's an increase of my... Oh yeah, what's wrong with this?
[78:18.20]Did I already get that?
[78:23.78]Harry Potter is as good as The Surge.
[78:26.76]Harry, come on now.
[78:28.44]I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one.
[78:31.69]Let's go across the bridge.
[78:33.51]Although there's people throwing shit.
[78:37.23]Here's the front door.
[78:40.64]And it opens.
[78:41.64]To a bunch of people.
[78:45.68]Oh my lord, I just got lit up.
[78:47.20]I don't know what he does!
[78:54.93]Oh, you hit me with that.
[78:58.49]Alright, we're gonna have to talk about the hit detection.
[79:09.03]Okay, so he doesn't hit me with that, but he hit me with the other one.
[79:13.41]Who told you that was correct?
[79:26.13]Me.
[79:26.55]I did.
[79:26.91]I told you that.
[79:28.55]Well, it wasn't correct.
[79:31.15]This is early access?
[79:32.04]No, the game's not in early access.
[79:33.32]It is a complete release, completely able to download to your computer screen.
[79:40.83]Nah, I gotta be careful.
[79:46.34]Please play music.
[79:47.30]I already have that common compact gun.
[79:58.39]Another spot.
[80:00.33]Where the hell am I?
[80:07.05]Is this back up?
[80:07.76]This is up top, the other side.
[80:12.04]How are you throwing that shit that far?
[80:13.52]This wraps back around.
[80:30.59]I don't need auto-aim!
[80:32.07]I'm fine!
[80:33.39]So, I don't want to go this way.
[80:38.48]I'm almost out of ammo.
[80:46.01]Oh my god.
[80:49.53]Well, this is... I need it off.
[80:54.17]I don't... I don't know.
[80:55.89]Let me go back this way for a second.
[81:02.03]And he hit me through a wall.
[81:03.69]Did that happen?
[81:04.61]Or am I making that up?
[81:05.53]Tell me if I'm making it up.
[81:06.33]I need to know.
[81:14.52]I made it up.
[81:14.94]Alright, I just wanna make sure I'm, uh, I wanna be real with myself.
[81:21.08]Oh, you stupid fucking game.
[81:22.84]You're gonna put Darkest Dungeon traps in this.
[81:31.71]Come on.
[81:34.35]Well, here's a ladder.
[81:53.56]don't you do it don't you do it well the stress sure is here he's got a cool voice too it goes
[82:16.31]I don't like it.
[82:17.11]What was that?
[82:17.59]I don't get it.
[82:18.97]I don't like it.
[82:38.46]What was that cereal?
[82:41.89]The cereal that Mikey didn't think he liked, but after he ate it a long enough time, he ended up liking the cereal.
[82:48.21]Life, right?
[82:54.27]That wasn't kicks.
[82:55.97]It was life.
[82:56.57]Alright.
[83:01.62]Where do I need to go?
[83:11.29]There's a ladder to go this way.
[83:14.60]I guess.
[83:17.28]Hurry up and do something exciting.
[83:19.08]I'm just... I'm playing a game!
[83:20.44]This is just sugar-free Cheerios.
[83:27.94]And guess what?
[83:28.35]It's healthier for you.
[83:34.23]Spill soda on your keyboard.
[83:37.07]Well, that would be intentional, which would mean it wouldn't be funny.
[83:43.05]That would be... Hey, look at how funny this is!
[83:45.17]And it would be intentional, therefore it would not be funny.
[83:48.07]You'd be like, oh, he did that on purpose.
[83:50.83]Am I on the other side?
[83:51.51]I am.
[83:56.91]I can use that.
[84:03.42]So now this is a shortcut from that last bonfire to over... I keep calling it bonfires.
[84:10.44]There we go.
[84:14.97]Shortcut.
[84:18.45]They're both the same gun.
[84:20.56]How do I upgrade?
[84:24.58]Should I upgrade this?
[84:25.62]Chat, what do you guys think?
[84:27.24]Should I upgrade?
[84:29.68]This is just the Titanite shards.
[84:32.06]I don't think I should do that.
[84:38.82]Upgrade the Cheerio gun.
[84:40.24]Quit game.
[84:41.76]I'm not done with this game.
[84:43.74]I'm not done with this game.
[84:50.90]No, I'm playing this game.
[84:54.02]This ain't gonna be Two Point Hospital 2, okay?
[85:01.90]This is what we're doing.
[85:08.80]Oh, look, you can turn it into a perfect...
[85:18.72]Decline.
[85:19.50]I don't think I need that right now.
[85:24.26]I can... I want to take this to 10, right?
[85:26.39]No, let's get... I want faster reload time.
[85:33.19]Range, weapon, and reload speed.
[85:34.93]I like it.
[85:36.67]Just wait for the... Look, all you guys have to do, like the person in chat just said, just wait for the boss that I can't stand.
[85:42.52]Wait for the first real boss for me to go... I don't even know... This game's not even good.
[85:45.90]This game's a bad game.
[85:46.78]I don't even like this game.
[85:47.74]I'm not a fan of this game.
[85:48.62]I don't even like it.
[85:50.36]And then, like, we'll do something else.
[85:51.56]That's what's gonna happen.
[85:52.30]You all know it.
[85:53.08]So just... It's just a little bit of patience.
[85:56.64]Like, I just don't fucking understand, like, why this fucking game does this.
[85:59.11]It's fucking stupid, right?
[86:00.63]Like, just wait for it.
[86:01.37]It'll happen in probably, like, less than 20 minutes.
[86:10.41]And then I'll rage quit the game.
[86:17.58]Oh, let's grab this one.
[86:26.32]Somebody said that's the only reason why I'm here, to be honest.
[86:29.22]Come on!
[86:32.70]Come on, man!
[86:37.20]Come on, like... I wonder what's even down here.
[86:52.01]Did you mean a blind legend?
[86:56.11]No, I almost got to the end of that game too.
[86:57.99]I have dreams about the fact that I didn't beat that game.
[87:14.28]Just shoot him.
[87:14.78]Watch out for the acid gun guy.
[87:22.53]God damn, I had to reload.
[87:26.48]Who has a sniper rifle?
[87:28.70]What the fuck, why?
[87:29.76]No, that's not funny, it's not funny.
[87:31.46]I know you played Dark Souls and you like Dark Souls and you made this game because you like Dark Souls, but I don't like that feature.
[87:48.40]This feature doesn't like you.
[87:55.03]They blend in too much with the ground.
[87:57.85]You gotta make them bright yellow.
[88:00.67]And have tons of lights all over them.
[88:02.29]They shoot into the ceiling.
[88:09.34]Nothing else over here.
[88:10.20]Okay, just making sure I didn't miss anything.
[88:13.72]I do not approve of this feature, kinda, sir.
[88:16.22]What's over there?
[88:17.06]Nothing.
[88:17.34]What's over there?
[88:18.11]Nothing.
[88:19.45]Cool.
[88:22.61]Pick up the first real boss fight that I'm gonna first try.
[88:30.51]He's too far away and he's behind.
[88:31.79]Okay.
[88:36.54]There's a lot of enemies in here.
[88:38.08]This is not gonna go well.
[88:39.84]I gotta bait this dude out.
[88:46.01]How far... Okay, that... Alright, let's talk about that for a second.
[88:49.25]I don't, like... What?
[88:51.21]Let's talk about this for a second.
[88:53.69]What am I, like a fucking guy running a radio show?
[88:56.29]I mean, kind of.
[88:59.95]Kind of.
[89:00.27]A little bit, yeah.
[89:03.61]You can say that.
[89:26.02]I didn't even pay.
[89:27.50]I was looking at like the chat room.
[89:30.26]I was looking at chat for that and that was not fair No God damn it Stop lying.
[89:47.47]How am I supposed to not?
[89:49.68]How do I communicate with you guys?
[89:51.40]How is that possible?
[89:57.07]How am I supposed to communicate?
[90:06.29]You don't.
[90:06.87]Well, I want to.
[90:07.65]I want to communicate.
[90:11.72]First goddamn contact.
[90:13.28]I want to be able to talk to you guys as the alien in the spaceship.
[90:24.28]Alright, watch out.
[90:25.47]This guy is my souls.
[90:33.10]Now just don't walk off the edge.
[90:36.88]There's my jaded carbine.
[90:38.22]That's an assault rifle.
[90:39.26]We'll take a look at that one in just a moment.
[90:50.95]Bit capsule.
[90:52.49]Sick.
[90:55.77]I'm almost out of ammo.
[90:57.92]Remember that.
[90:58.99]Somebody needs to remind me about that.
[91:00.57]When I get down to 10 ammo, scream as loud as you can into your microphone.
[91:04.89]I'll be able to hear it.
[91:07.35]I have to level up.
[91:10.35]Don't I?
[91:15.80]Big guy over there.
[91:16.76]Can I snipe his back?
[91:20.92]Where the hell are you?
[91:22.10]What the what?
[91:22.84]I have to get across.
[91:35.51]Melee actually would be a pretty easy build.
[91:39.12]Which it kind of would.
[91:40.98]But I'm not doing it.
[91:41.66]There's like too many places to go.
[91:48.28]Oh shit.
[92:00.43]Wait, why did you scream?
[92:01.25]Why didn't you guys scream?
[92:03.09]I didn't hear anything.
[92:04.20]You didn't do it loud enough.
[92:21.67]I'm gonna run out of bullets before I go into the next door.
[92:31.26]He's got full stamina.
[92:33.92]The one thing... Okay, I'll give you one pro to this game, those of you that are saying, whoa, what the fuck, game's not even... I can... You can see their stamina bar.
[92:41.83]It's very helpful.
[92:50.36]why they have to have people up there.
[92:55.72]Just play Nioh?
[92:58.67]Alright, I'll play Nioh when Nioh 2 comes out.
[93:02.35]And I'm going to play them like this.
[93:03.41]I'm going to play the first level of Nioh 1 and then the first level of Nioh 2.
[93:07.31]And then the second level of Nioh 1 and the second level of Nioh 2.
[93:16.17]I have to deal with this guy right now.
[93:23.10]Play it right now.
[93:23.86]I unhooked my PlayStation 4 to be able to stream this game.
[93:33.19]What do I do when I'm out of ammo?
[93:37.79]Every time you die, switch games.
[93:44.52]Oh, God.
[93:46.34]Oh, that would be so... You'd have to get used to so much stuff.
[93:52.57]I don't think that would actually be possible to do that.
[93:54.41]I can't fucking break.
[94:06.96]I'm not at stamina.
[94:07.96]That's what that is.
[94:12.60]Come up here.
[94:15.86]I'm not fighting up there.
[94:18.50]I'm going up.
[94:20.24]Wait, there's a ladder.
[94:21.40]Kick it, kick it, kick it, kick it!
[94:24.18]No, I didn't even need to kick this.
[94:25.26]Alright, did I?
[94:28.30]What's the point of this?
[94:33.98]Oh, that's the point of this.
[94:36.46]If there's spikes here and I end up dying into the water, I'm deleting the game.
[94:43.23]Yeah, he doesn't have to get deleted.
[94:45.53]That's pretty good.
[94:48.43]Nice.
[94:48.87]Okay.
[94:55.01]This goes all the way back.
[94:56.77]Forlorn Idol.
[94:57.61]I don't know if this stuff even does it.
[94:59.43]Oh, you almost had it.
[95:01.71]You almost got another game, guys.
[95:03.98]It was real close.
[95:06.36]That was really close.
[95:13.78]Everyone's rooting for me to die.
[95:15.46]I've never seen so many people all hope that I got hit by spikes.
[95:24.03]This is a weird shortcut.
[95:25.75]Let me see.
[95:26.29]How far back does this go?
[95:30.67]This goes right to... Remember I pointed at that guy?
[95:33.70]Okay, so this is a big shortcut.
[95:36.16]Because the obelisk is in here, isn't it?
[95:40.36]So I can go all the way around.
[95:41.44]Alright.
[95:42.00]Let's go to the obelisk.
[95:53.10]You can't die, you're immortal.
[95:55.42]Wouldn't that be so weird if you were immortal?
[95:56.89]Like, what the heck would you do?
[95:58.83]You know what I mean?
[96:00.49]What the heck would you do if you were immortal?
[96:04.75]I can use this.
[96:05.29]A little bit more damage, less ammo, less crit, more armor pen, more stability, more range, more recoil, more reload time.
[96:15.67]What about this one?
[96:20.60]I can't even use the shotgun.
[96:21.58]I can't use shotguns.
[96:25.38]Let's try it.
[96:29.54]Burst fire.
[96:30.14]Let's try it.
[96:35.73]Take a look.
[96:42.31]The heck would you do?
[96:42.99]What the heck would you even do?
[96:46.11]I don't like the number 13, so...
[96:49.93]Let's get that right out.
[96:51.95]Just absolutely get that out of the way.
[96:53.43]Let's eat a bit.
[96:55.63]And then get another... Let's do another point of agility.
[97:02.88]What the fuck does expertise do?
[97:05.82]I have no idea.
[97:07.05]Alright, let's do... Bit capsule small.
[97:12.15]Just take it.
[97:18.49]13 is my birthday.
[97:19.25]Well, that's fine to have your birthday at 13, but... The number 13 is a weird number, you know what I mean?
[97:29.97]One of those scary numbers.
[97:31.05]It's just weird.
[97:34.72]I personally think this game is actually kind of shit.
[97:38.64]Well, Combine, you don't have to say that, because I... 70% of every person in the chat personally would say the same thing.
[97:47.81]But it's okay, because I... We're doing me tonight, you know what I mean?
[97:51.91]This is me tonight.
[97:53.56]This gun's not good.
[98:07.57]So now I can wrap all the way around.
[98:20.91]You cannot hipfire that.
[98:23.05]Do not even try doing that.
[98:26.55]Guys, don't do it when you buy this game.
[98:34.05]Oh, shh, don't say anything.
[98:34.95]Here it comes.
[98:35.68]Here comes the spike.
[98:36.48]He's going to step on it and it's going to end this series on Twitch.
[98:41.10]Where is it?
[98:43.18]There it is.
[98:43.68]Watch out.
[98:44.12]Don't make him end the series.
[98:45.22]End the series.
[98:50.85]Alright, we're good.
[98:59.49]Season finale.
[99:02.89]I already pre-audit this.
[99:03.97]Wish me luck.
[99:04.61]I wish you good luck.
[99:10.13]We gotta go up.
[99:11.79]Give us a boss already.
[99:12.71]I'm trying to get there.
[99:13.73]I can only go so fast.
[99:26.64]Skip those enemies for now.
[99:30.87]What is that thing?
[99:38.62]Come on!
[99:57.64]Stop talking shit!
[99:59.16]Stop, don't talk shit!
[100:05.24]I'm poisoned right now.
[100:06.36]Are you kidding me?
[100:10.46]Oh, fuck you!
[100:11.72]Come on, man!
[100:13.15]Why?
[100:24.89]That was not House Carl.
[100:27.44]Don't give me that fake news.
[100:35.17]I'm going back for my revenge.
[100:40.07]Hey, my power attack.
[100:40.97]What is it?
[100:42.96]Let's go.
[100:48.18]Sprint.
[100:50.12]I think I already leveled up.
[100:59.49]I'm addicted to this game?
[101:02.71]No, I... Well, oh come on!
[101:06.75]I'm looking at the fucking chat room!
[101:08.79]I'm looking at the chat room and that... I didn't knock into the water so it doesn't count.
[101:12.00]Okay.
[101:14.32]Listen.
[101:18.06]I'm not addicted to this game.
[101:21.34]We're at an hour and 42 minutes in the stream, right?
[101:25.52]I am going to deliberately stop playing this game at two hours and one minute.
[101:30.14]Just to spite you all, because I can't refund it anymore.
[101:33.68]What is this?
[101:38.48]I might not even stop.
[101:42.45]I might not even stop.
[101:43.25]I'm not going to run by the double-fisted hamburger-hotdog-gun guy.
[101:48.17]What the fuck are you talking about?
[102:00.24]I'm gonna use the environment to my advantage here.
[102:10.92]Get the fuck out of here, dude.
[102:21.56]I'm almost done with him.
[102:34.78]Shit!
[102:35.38]Shit!
[102:43.63]What?! !
[103:04.02]He killed me fucking instantly.
[103:05.60]You got gnomed.
[103:27.56]This loser died to the hamburger hotdog.
[103:38.77]Come on.
[103:39.45]That's such bullshit.
[103:42.49]The guy has a fucking bullet sponge and he's just gonna unload before the... Fuck this.
[103:57.13]You can swim in this game.
[103:58.53]No, you can't.
[104:00.35]That guy can't.
[104:01.75]That guy can't.
[104:03.23]Neither can- They're all dead in the water.
[104:04.85]What makes you think I'm gonna believe the fact that I can go in this water?
[104:10.60]You're different.
[104:11.96]Okay.
[104:13.70]Sure.
[104:20.23]I can't believe it.
[104:21.25]The thing that's making me laugh so hard is that you died to the fucking hamper hotdog guy.
[104:26.47]That's the guy's name?
[104:27.37]That's the enemy's name?
[104:28.37]Ugh.
[104:29.59]I'll get him.
[104:31.75]I'll get that guy.
[104:33.87]Fucking too human.
[104:34.89]I'll show you who's a too human.
[104:44.36]Where is he?
[104:48.38]Where's that?
[104:48.76]Is he gone?
[104:51.51]Where'd he go?
[104:51.95]Is he dead?
[104:52.33]I don't understand.
[104:53.73]Was that like a special enemy that when he dies doesn't come back?
[105:00.28]But I didn't get the item he dropped.
[105:01.50]If he dropped one, right?
[105:04.78]This is where he was before.
[105:15.13]No, he's gone, man.
[105:16.77]This dude's dead.
[105:18.49]I win.
[105:23.82]There we go, alright.
[105:26.14]Oh, we all jump.
[105:30.16]This is gonna get us to... Reduces fire damage taken by 20%.
[105:34.18]Nice, cool, nice, sweet.
[105:37.73]I believe if I was a boss room, it would be this one.
[105:47.33]Maybe.
[105:49.05]Possibly.
[105:49.73]Let's just find out.
[105:54.51]Alright.
[105:57.91]No, this is just another way to go through here, which is the... Okay.
[106:08.15]It's a shortcut from the shortcut that we had, but we already had a shortcut unlocked from this shortcut.
[106:11.76]I have no idea what's going on.
[106:16.78]I can't do any of this stuff.
[106:18.04]I need... That's way too much.
[106:19.50]I'll never get it.
[106:27.49]I'm not going to use this.
[106:28.11]This thing's dumb.
[106:31.03]I'm going to upgrade this.
[106:34.28]I have 22 basic components.
[106:36.04]Let me get this to level 2, right?
[106:39.30]I have to.
[106:49.53]Why can I not do this?
[106:50.45]I have 22 basic components.
[106:53.79]I have to do level 1 first.
[107:01.36]I don't have any landmark tokens, though.
[107:03.62]Does that matter?
[107:10.05]I did it.
[107:11.37]Am I gonna do it again?
[107:19.37]I wonder how mad everyone just got at me for doing that.
[107:21.83]Well, you don't have to get mad at that.
[107:22.93]This is like, you don't even like this game.
[107:24.18]You know what I'm saying?
[107:28.74]All the people that just are like, dude, why the hell did you do that, man?
[107:31.10]What the fuck are you thinking?
[107:31.96]You don't even like this game.
[107:38.32]If you liked this game, maybe you'd have, you know, something to say.
[107:41.64]Nothing else over here?
[107:45.37]Where am I going?
[107:51.79]I went the wrong way.
[107:55.07]Why did he just teleport into existence?
[108:00.88]I am beyond yeah, okay this is We're gonna keep going up there it is that door blended in with the wall I
[108:18.42]Alright, back in action here.
[108:19.98]Can't wait for the first major boss of the game, which is coming up here.
[108:23.64]It is the dinosaur.
[108:24.80]If you didn't know, guys, for the tutorial and walkthrough purposes, this title of this video is going to be, uh, Going Through Green-Dinosaur Boss?
[108:34.61]Just in case anyone was wondering, that's the title of this part of the playthrough.
[108:39.11]I think it's gonna be really fun.
[108:44.82]But it's gonna go up.
[108:51.65]Ooh.
[108:52.97]Bit canister lard.
[108:55.05]Well.
[108:57.47]I'm making fun of my past self.
[108:58.91]Look, if you can't make fun of your past self, then you're deemed to repeat it.
[109:01.55]Interesting.
[109:04.45]Who said that famous quote?
[109:07.01]Now I'm doing damage.
[109:12.11]I could go over that way.
[109:13.11]This guy is deemed...
[109:27.13]I see a boss there.
[109:28.05]I see an eyeball room.
[109:29.99]Let's... Hold on.
[109:31.55]Just wait.
[109:35.60]This door needs a key.
[109:37.60]Really?
[109:38.68]Well, it's not that far.
[109:40.48]Here we go.
[109:43.56]Arden.
[109:44.44]Tribunal of Souls.
[109:45.72]Are you ready?
[109:47.76]It's gonna go... Is that peaking the mic?
[109:52.75]I hope it's not.
[110:00.15]Oh, what?
[110:00.89]That was... Home Guard Commander.
[110:10.21]Would you look at that?
[110:11.83]I can't hurt.
[110:12.81]What am I hitting?
[110:13.71]Right in the back.
[110:15.81]I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[110:35.48]Ow.
[110:36.80]I got greedy.
[110:45.54]What's happening to my body?
[110:46.38]What's happening to my body?
[110:47.14]What's happening to my body?
[110:47.90]Alright, I'll step in the green.
[111:03.62]Holy shit, that almost hit me.
[111:11.90]Oh, he almost got me there.
[111:12.86]Oh, I have 15 shots.
[111:13.94]Oh, jeez.
[111:28.10]I guess I could just shoot him.
[111:29.64]No, you have to do the right thing.
[111:37.51]She's the end.
[111:38.85]Wow, that almost hit me.
[111:40.87]Reload it.
[111:41.29]Reload it.
[111:42.49]You stupid idiot.
[111:43.41]Don't die here.
[111:52.40]First try.
[111:53.10]There we go.
[111:53.48]Now we play the game for the rest of the night.
[112:00.24]First boss was harder than that.
[112:08.59]Legion, Hellcaster, Cursed Blade, Advanced Component, Assyrium, and Offensive.
[112:13.37]Didn't even get to see what the hell that was.
[112:15.55]Rare melee weapon.
[112:16.55]There's rarities in this game, guys.
[112:22.70]What a boss.
[112:23.30]Wow, got hit once.
[112:24.42]Wow.
[112:25.32]See ya, lads.

[112:28.04]No, don't leave.
[112:29.26]What do you mean everyone leave?
[112:37.55]Why?
[112:38.27]What?
[112:38.55]Why would you leave?
[112:42.45]What's the matter?
[112:45.74]Good night.
[112:46.26]No.
[112:46.64]Why do you guys have to be such dicks?
[112:56.89]What's this?
[112:57.53]Teleportation?
[112:58.77]Nope.
[112:59.53]Can I turn this back on?
[113:03.21]I get to turn this back on.
[113:15.73]The viewer count went up.
[113:30.10]Jerm is the dad desperately trying to convince his kids that a game he got them is good.
[113:35.84]I've not tried to convince anybody of anything.
[113:38.50]There was a brief flicker on this side.
[113:41.54]Were you able to restore the orb?
[113:52.58]I just, I, this game was like 50, oh, by the way, it's been five minutes till the game is refundable.
[114:00.73]Right, it's an hour and 55.
[114:02.47]Five minutes till the game's refundable.
[114:05.87]I'm gonna take a piss.
[114:06.74]I'll be right back.
[114:13.34]We can count it down.
[114:14.06]I'm just going to go pee.
[114:15.84]I'll be right back.
[114:16.44]I'll be back for the countdown.
[114:18.26]Oh, no, wait a minute.
[114:18.80]Hour and 37.
[114:19.60]That's not correct.
[114:20.28]That's stream time.
[114:21.70]There's your countdown on the screen right there.
[114:25.11]We've got about 20 minutes.
[114:28.71]But I'm going to pee.
[114:29.49]I'm going to grab another drink, and I'll be right back.
[114:32.93]See you in two seconds.

[117:53.79]What the hell?
[117:54.37]Okay.
[117:55.29]Agony.
[117:55.71]Increases critical damage, but you don't have any aspect patterns.
[118:01.97]Two ciphers.
[118:02.71]Decode to unlock new aspect patterns.
[118:07.69]Do you want to spend 300 bits to decode this?
[118:10.06]Sure.
[118:10.48]Increases dodge speed.
[118:17.20]Oh.
[118:19.32]I kind of like that.
[118:21.02]I have another one to do.
[118:24.13]Decoded Raider.
[118:26.91]Submachine guns are ideal for dealing a lot of damage over a limited period of time.
[118:30.75]Increase damage with submachine guns.
[118:32.92]Oh, look at that.
[118:36.24]Put it on.
[118:42.22]Alright, what do I got?
[118:43.40]Hellcaster.
[118:44.06]This requires strength.
[118:45.44]Goodbye.
[118:48.69]This is all I got.
[118:50.68]I got a new melee weapon, but it requires strength.
[118:53.68]Again, I can't use it.
[119:01.60]Attributes, we're going to do 15.
[119:03.88]No.
[119:13.37]As my manager, you advised me to quit this game and play Roblox.
[119:20.41]No, I'm, I'm, no, no, no.
[119:22.85]What do we got for time here?
[119:23.99]One minute, one hour and one minute and 42 seconds.
[119:26.27]That would be a very long minute and 42 seconds.
[119:31.95]Can I go through this door?
[119:33.47]That's not a door.
[119:40.82]I guess, I don't do, I guess we just leave.
[119:42.56]I have to go back to the Nexus.
[119:46.98]Fire that manager.
[119:48.68]I don't have a manager.
[119:49.58]My manager is me.
[119:54.80]Do I have the key to unlock this gate now?
[120:01.47]Fire.
[120:01.87]I can't fire myself.
[120:02.95]I'm the only person in my whole company.
[120:08.07]You don't fire yourself.
[120:12.19]Do I need the key?
[120:13.01]Well, what the hell?
[120:15.87]Do I actually have to run all the way back?
[120:17.53]No, I don't.
[120:18.27]Right?
[120:26.83]I do?
[120:30.37]Yes.
[120:31.17]Yes.
[120:32.21]Yes.
[120:42.06]I need a key.
[120:43.20]Well, where am I supposed to get it?
[120:49.29]Use your bitcat.
[120:50.59]He told me to come back.
[120:56.70]Let's just go back.
[120:57.36]I already got this.
[121:01.66]Was there a boss yet?
[121:02.42]Yeah, there was.
[121:03.52]I just beat it first try.
[121:07.55]He dropped the key in the water.
[121:10.03]Wouldn't that be fun?
[121:12.25]Is this going to kill me?
[121:29.25]You fucking... Come on, man.
[121:32.19]Why would you put me back here?
[121:34.16]This is an obelisk, right?
[121:35.46]Of course it is.
[121:46.77]Minutes are going so slow.
[121:48.05]Whatever.
[121:57.02]Why are you not done with this?
[122:00.84]I don't know.
[122:02.02]I don't know.
[122:03.24]I don't hate this.
[122:07.52]I don't dislike this.
[122:09.09]I'm telling you.
[122:11.95]I don't know.
[122:12.47]There's no reason why I haven't stopped.
[122:18.13]I don't dislike this.
[122:20.80]I almost ran off the edge.
[122:32.49]play lego world he hates us more than he likes this game there's nothing to do with hating and not hating it's to do with disliking and not disliking no no it's not disliking either of those things so what we just go up here and out do I have to go all the way back to the painting
[123:02.61]Vegas changed you.
[123:04.99]Well, that's interesting because I ain't even there yet.

[124:17.70]So many people subbed you.
[124:18.62]Why aren't you satisfied?
[124:19.64]I didn't want money.
[124:22.34]Monetarily, I just want a card.
[124:23.52]That's it.
[124:33.72]Okay.
[124:35.56]Is this going to turn?
[124:36.20]A thousand bits to open the door.
[124:39.27]Man, why are you charging me to open the doors now?
[124:43.13]I want a card with money in it.

[137:33.08]It's two hours and 20 minutes in the game.
[137:41.15]That counts everything.
[137:42.81]It counts like menu time.
[137:51.40]The stream's been up for like two hours and 20 minutes.
[137:55.54]I'm glad I couldn't do it.
[137:59.33]I'm happy about this.
[138:01.60]Because guess what?
[138:02.18]That means I get to keep playing it.
[138:03.42]Because I like this game.
[138:05.40]You understand?
[138:06.02]I'm having a good time in this game.
[138:12.26]And I'm glad I couldn't do it.

[139:37.37]Two Point Hospital sounds really sweet right about now.
[139:40.85]See?
[139:46.57]See?
[139:49.07]I bet you'd like it if I played Two Point Hospital.
[139:51.73]Instead of screaming and yelling at the fact that I played it three days ago.
[139:56.15]Or a week ago.
[139:56.81]I don't even know what day it was.
[140:03.38]I bet you'd all like that a lot, wouldn't you?

[140:49.48]Yeah, you would have.
[140:52.35]I would have done that in, like, June of next year or something.
[141:05.68]I couldn't save the people from lightheadedness.
[141:10.92]Yeah, because I couldn't save myself from Chatteris Orungus.
[141:28.39]I need to look down here.
[141:34.56]Step into my office.
[141:42.34]No, no, now I'm all flustered.

[145:04.24]Sometimes, I'll tell you.
[145:05.34]Sometimes I feel like I'm on chopped with you guys.
[145:24.17]I present the video game in front of the judges.
[145:27.35]And it goes from judge to judge.
[145:29.39]Well, I mean, this was... This was actually kind of not that good.
[145:33.12]The dodging mechanic wasn't good.
[145:35.44]And you forgot the garnish.
[145:37.52]There's no garnish here.
[145:39.26]You didn't make a joke in the first... Excuse me, I don't think you're going to make it to the next round.

[147:06.36]They thought I was going to go down and click on quit game.
[147:10.74]They know that they can't escape this game that they hate so much.
[147:17.26]It would be incredibly difficult for them.
[147:19.86]There's no way.
[147:21.60]All they would need to do is press the X in the top right corner of their screen.
[147:27.40]But I have a spell on them.
[147:28.58]They're not allowed.
[147:29.21]I can't do it.
[147:30.19]It's impossible.
[147:47.31]I'm losing viewers.
[147:48.79]The button's not working.

[149:01.69]So every time I die, we're going to play a round of Google Feud.
[149:07.21]It's going to be on the screen.
[149:09.78]See, that means all people that don't want it.
[149:11.98]You've got two games going on.
[149:16.81]See?

[149:56.14]We don't have to make it big and huge.
[150:01.20]Where can it go?
[150:02.34]That's ammo.
[150:03.10]This is all important information.
[150:05.50]It can't go anywhere.
[150:06.54]It has to stay off the screen.
[150:09.89]I'm not going to put it in the center of the screen.
[150:21.88]Okay, so I'm ready to try.
[150:25.68]So I did just die.
[150:27.40]That's correct.
[150:29.78]So hold on.
[150:37.59]This is not even the right goddamn spot.
[150:41.03]I need another monitor.
[150:42.59]I need two monitors for this.
[150:48.61]Okay, that looks good.
[150:49.29]Alright, choose a category.
[150:54.49]Category is going to be... I can do it at the same time.
[150:59.63]Category is going to be questions.

[151:28.96]Can you eat rotten food?
[151:32.60]I don't know.
[151:33.12]I have no idea.
[151:35.23]Acorns.
[151:37.05]We died again, so we have to do it again.
[151:40.63]Can you eat acorns?
[151:41.89]Can you eat a coyote?
[151:42.91]Can you eat raw shrimp, raw bacon, raw eggs?
[151:47.09]Can you eat weed?

[155:52.70]I don't want to be the one that writes it.

[159:44.57]Aaron Aardvark?
[159:47.46]Is that a real person?

[160:41.62]What?
[160:46.93]What happened?
[160:52.85]Why did that just pop up?
[160:58.19]That was weird.

[161:08.62]Okay.
[161:10.62]Thank you, I guess.
[161:17.01]I got a new sidearm too.
[161:18.07]Everybody just calm down.
[161:21.17]We're fine.
[161:30.20]That guy needed to go down.
[161:34.22]Too far away.
[161:35.08]Am I?
[161:37.38]Too far away.
[161:37.90]Whatever.
[161:38.16]I almost had an ammo with a sidearm.

[161:46.01]Is that what's going on?
[161:47.65]Hey, thanks, guys.

[176:24.49]Then, like, upgrade.
[176:28.11]Probably not a bad idea, but no, fuck it.
[176:30.87]Just try to run by them.

[237:04.35]I can play this game!
[237:12.65]Oxygen.

[237:19.34]I know how to spell oxygen, guys.
[237:20.58]I just, that was a funny joke I got you with.
[237:25.02]Alright, guys.
[237:26.42]That's going to wrap up tonight's stream.
[237:28.82]So, listen.
[237:32.06]I'm going to be away this weekend.
[237:33.16]I have a wedding to go to tomorrow.
[237:35.62]I've got some other things going on over the weekend that I cannot stream.
[237:40.86]So we're going to start Oblivion on Monday.
[237:45.26]We're going to start Oblivion on Monday.
[237:48.94]I don't know how far we're going to go, but we're just going to fuck around in Oblivion and see if we're still having fun.
[237:54.74]We'll do it again.
[237:58.87]Thank you for hanging out.
[238:02.27]If you're taking off, see you later.
[238:04.59]Thanks for stepping around.
[238:07.21]And my final verdict for this game is...
[238:14.35]Then I don't even matter.
[238:15.59]The election is already over.
[238:17.23]Right?
[238:17.79]It's already over.
[238:20.63]This game was... This game was... Fill it up.
[238:29.09]This game was weed.
[238:32.08]This game has to have at least a 60 out of 100 because the frogman made it.
[238:35.44]That's important to know.
[238:40.06]I thought it was an enjoyable experience.
[238:42.22]Until...
[238:43.99]I was getting just instantly killed by people across the map.
[238:48.93]But then I also couldn't focus.
[238:50.39]Everybody was yelling at me.
[238:51.55]I was getting yelled at.
[238:55.86]No, no, you've watched it if you think it's interesting.
[238:57.80]I don't know.
[239:02.86]That's getting yelled at.
[239:03.62]I had to change gears.
[239:08.63]That's the fun part.
[239:09.73]That's the fun part.
[239:17.90]But regardless, let's do the credits.
[239:20.84]Thank you everybody for watching.
[239:21.84]Hopefully the webcam's not going to turn on.
[239:23.36]I have no clothes on.
[239:26.02]And thanks for sticking around for the Google feud.
[239:27.38]I'll see you guys on Monday for Oblivion.
[239:30.15]Probably not, maybe unmodded.
[239:32.27]I don't know if I want to start right off the bat with doing insane shit because you saw what happened in The Sims.
[239:37.59]Played The Sims with a bunch of crazy shit on and there's no way you could ever go back.
[239:41.97]So, I don't know.
[239:42.87]We'll see.
[239:43.25]We'll have to talk about that in the Discord over the weekend.
[239:47.40]But,
[239:49.67]Thanks everybody sticking around.
[239:50.67]Here come the credits.

[243:08.29]Thank you guys for subscribing.
[243:11.43]Thank you for staying subscribed.
[243:12.55]Thank you for being subscribed or getting a gift sub.
[243:14.82]Thanks.
[243:18.81]Much love to you.
[243:20.43]That's not the right thing.
[243:21.29]We're going this way.
[243:24.21]There it is.
[243:26.47]See you on Monday.
[243:27.03]If you're sticking around for the bits, here we go.
[243:30.37]Why don't we scroll a little?
[243:33.82]Scroll a little.
[243:34.64]Okay, here it is.
[243:36.64]Hey, FalloutGuy, thank you.
[243:38.50]Hey, SquidPigs, thanks for the $1.
[243:39.66]No message.
[243:41.76]SquidPigs, thanks again for $4.
[243:42.82]$3 here, $4 total.
[243:43.28]No message.
[243:44.20]Thank you, dude.
[243:47.69]We had five gifted subs from Watching Who earlier.
[243:51.24]We already talked about it, but thanks a lot, man.
[243:54.32]M4O Magiosna.
[243:57.34]I don't know.
[243:57.90]This name is... I'm just going to call you M4.
[244:00.18]Thanks for the $2, dude.
[244:00.78]I'm going to call you M4O.
[244:05.24]Please try to stream earlier for the EU folks.
[244:09.28]I try to do EU streams from time to time, but the problem is time zones are just a problem no matter what.
[244:17.27]So if I stream at like 3 o'clock in the afternoon, which is what I'm going to do, I'm going to be in Las Vegas, right?
[244:23.91]So streaming at like 2 to 3 p.m.
[244:26.81]Pacific is still, it's still going to be 6 o'clock Eastern, 7 o'clock Eastern, which is still 11, 12 EU time.
[244:37.35]Nothing I can do about it.
[244:38.09]I'm going to be on Pacific time.
[244:40.99]Even if I streamed at noon, which I'm not going to do,
[244:46.55]I have to stream at the times that I know that I can put the energy in to do it.
[244:53.67]I do try sometimes to stream a lot earlier.
[244:56.33]At least a couple times a month I try to pull it back at least a couple hours.
[244:58.94]At least three, four, five hours.
[245:02.84]Sorry that we are so far apart.
[245:06.26]Stream at 9am.
[245:07.48]I could never do that.
[245:13.91]But
[245:14.38]Thank you, though.
[245:14.82]Appreciate it, though, M4.
[245:16.04]Thanks for the two bucks.
[245:18.48]Kazzy also gave five gifted subs earlier.
[245:22.91]Again, they're showing up here.
[245:24.25]I want to make sure we touch upon them.
[245:26.61]Thank you so much, dude.
[245:28.61]Bake Me Home, thanks for the $1.
[245:31.57]The Free iPod, thanks for the $1.
[245:34.08]I will give the streamer bits because he is a funny in-game joke.
[245:37.98]It's a funny in-game joke.
[245:39.10]Oh, okay.
[245:43.16]Thanks a lot, Free iPod.
[245:45.19]Lucky Dingo, thanks for the two bucks.
[245:47.09]No message.
[245:47.53]Thanks a lot, man.
[245:49.95]Mega Agro, thanks for the $1.
[245:52.32]Frexter, thanks for the $1.
[245:53.60]If you get bits in the game, you get bits in real life.
[245:57.20]Yeah, we had a little joke going there.
[245:58.48]Now, it would have been funny if you guys adhered to that and I had zero in the corner at the end of the stream.
[246:07.58]And then no one was allowed to give me any money.
[246:12.33]But thank you, though.
[246:14.12]Thank you, Razzle, for the two bucks.
[246:16.76]We touched upon it earlier, but he said walking stick of rhubarb.
[246:19.02]Thank you, man.
[246:20.61]Ape808, thanks for the five dollars.
[246:22.19]Eat poop.
[246:23.31]I'm not going to.
[246:26.05]It sounds like you answered some of those Google questions, though.
[246:29.55]Thank you, though, dude.
[246:31.21]Kip, thanks for the fourteen dollars, Kip.
[246:34.33]Don't tell me what to do.
[246:35.13]This is when I said don't give me any money.
[246:37.23]It has to be how many bits I have in the game, but Kip came in and dropped fourteen dollars.
[246:43.44]thank you so much dude and I'm not going to tell you what to do you're free to do whatever you feel but thank you so much uh thank you she xo xo for the one dollar you found a bit capsule and I opened it thank you sand raker thanks for the one dollar my undertaker will destroy him at summer slam as always

[247:17.17]No, I had a different binaryman.
[247:18.69]Thank you for the $5, binaryman.
[247:20.31]This is oops, misclick.
[247:25.79]Well, sorry about the misclick, but thank you for the $5, binaryman.
[247:30.51]Doubled 11.
[247:31.57]Thank you, doubled 11 for the $1.
[247:33.13]I was forced to donate these.
[247:35.60]Not by me.
[247:36.64]Thank you, dude.
[247:38.58]Control, Couchfire, thanks for the $1.
[247:41.60]How come these don't show up in your game?
[247:45.83]Free iPod, thanks for the $1.
[247:47.33]I can't stop.
[247:50.73]Boy314, thanks for the $3.
[247:54.15]Streamer forced me to donate 300 bits.
[247:57.91]Again, I didn't.
[247:59.65]I didn't do that.
[248:04.33]But thank you for the $3, dude.
[248:06.42]It was forced.
[248:07.42]No, it was not.
[248:08.96]All I said was, don't do it.
[248:12.56]I said the reverse of what you're saying.
[248:15.65]But thank you.
[248:16.67]Thank you, Spooky Doobie, for the $1.
[248:18.55]Use these bits to upgrade attunement.
[248:23.17]I will do that, whatever that is.
[248:25.79]Molly Perf, thanks for the $4.
[248:27.45]No message, but thank you, Molly Perf, for the $4.
[248:31.22]Sen Vestra, thanks for the $1.
[248:32.66]No message.
[248:34.04]Thank you.
[248:37.25]Mr. All, Mr. Ollie, Mr. All Three says, thanks.
[248:42.61]Love the sub sounds.
[248:45.91]Well, I'm glad you do because they'll probably be there for about two years because that's how long it took me to change the other ones.
[248:51.50]But thank you.
[248:52.16]Chunky Balona gave five gifted subs earlier too.
[248:54.24]We touched upon it, but thank you so much, dude.
[248:56.14]Very generous of you.
[248:57.40]Thanks a lot, man.
[248:59.93]Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[249:01.95]I didn't know Hellboy became a YouTuber.
[249:04.52]I can't wait to watch his 10-minute, 2-second long videos on reviewing LEGO racer sets and doing funny voices.
[249:15.66]To get the extra ad, right?
[249:17.95]Oh, man.
[249:20.23]To get the extra ad.
[249:21.93]That's fucking crazy.
[249:24.27]L Mushroom, thanks for the $1.
[249:26.25]Here's your pay-to-win Bits greedy streamer.
[249:30.67]Thank you.
[249:32.64]smelly boy thanks for the one dollar how does it feel knowing you've cultivated a chat that would much rather watch you play geoguessr for four hours than an innovative interesting game trying new things I don't know innovative doesn't mean good is what cyber brisket says
[250:05.20]Did I miss GeoGuessr?
[250:07.26]No, I missed him playing GeoGuessr.
[250:14.46]No.
[250:16.11]No, I know you guys are just fucking around a lot of the time.
[250:18.67]It's just part of the fun.
[250:22.77]But I'm allowed to give it back.
[250:24.75]You know?
[250:28.51]I'm allowed to use my power every now and then.
[250:30.95]I activate my move.
[250:32.88]And when I take a certain amount of damage, I can activate my big explosion, right?
[250:37.50]It's a big AOE like .
[250:47.53]Roll for initiative first.
[250:55.19]Why do my feet smell like weed?
[250:57.87]Why would you type that?
[251:00.15]I don't even know why you type that.
[251:05.29]But anyways.
[251:07.89]Thank you, Chubby Funster.
[251:08.89]Thank you, El Mushroom.
[251:09.77]Thank you, Smelly Boy.
[251:11.45]Thank you, Lemon Pudding for the $2.
[251:13.31]I am a Master of Comedy 209 fan and I don't appreciate you posting spoilers in his chat.
[251:18.11]That's not cool.
[251:21.03]Well, I'm going to Clark Kent Peter Parker you here and take the mask off.
[251:25.02]That's my Clark Kent.
[251:27.30]It's me.
[251:29.82]Sorry.
[251:31.74]I hate to blow it, but there it is.
[251:34.61]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[251:37.75]Happy Friday, Jerma.
[251:38.75]I got my party hat on.
[251:40.09]Check out this noisemaker.
[251:41.39]And he goes, woo, woo, woo.
[251:44.31]It's a weird noisemaker.
[251:45.17]I don't know why it sounds like that.
[251:47.14]I'm glad to hear the move is going over relatively smoothly after all the hardship.
[251:51.22]Anyway, since it was one of my birthdays the other week, one of your birthdays, you're only allowed to have one birthday.
[252:00.31]Oh, cats get nine birthdays.
[252:01.83]I only celebrated two, though.
[252:02.93]I was wondering if you could sing a birthday song.
[252:04.49]It could be the normal one, the rat birthday song, maybe something original.
[252:09.34]Yeah, I'll sing happy birthday to you.
[252:10.80]Sure.
[252:32.62]Okay, that was just you guys seen the South Park movie when Terrence and Phillip or
[253:03.89]doing their song before they got famous.
[253:10.87]That's what that was.
[253:12.79]Happy birthday, Garfield.
[253:15.64]Caveman, thanks for the $4, Caveman.
[253:17.44]No message, thanks a lot.
[253:18.30]Pocket Pauling gave five community subs.
[253:23.58]Thanks to the five subs, man.
[253:24.80]To the random people that got it.
[253:28.27]Thank you.
[253:29.60]Hey, The Jack, thanks for the $1 fun fact of the day.
[253:31.86]Banging your head against a wall for one hour burns 150 calories and a disproportionate amount of brain cells.
[253:40.29]I think that's a... I wouldn't call that a fun fact.
[253:43.41]I would call that a fact.
[253:45.75]It's just a true statement.
[253:49.37]It's time for slime.
[253:50.13]Thanks for the $5 time for slime.
[253:52.43]Dermot, don't listen to these haters.
[253:54.67]Also, pro tip for chat, if you just open a tab in your browser and play Ragtime songs on YouTube, you can create your own instant comedy no matter what the game is.
[254:08.44]Also, a true statement, also a fact here.
[254:11.78]Oh, haters.
[254:17.36]It can be fun if you want it to be.
[254:20.21]you time for slime for the five bucks and your very very good fun fact of the day hey Peter thanks Peter for the five dollars 63 cents lost bits recovered thank you Peter for your very specific amount of five dollars and 63 cents appreciate that man the Jack thanks for the one dollar they say next we did we technically did thank you div usp for the three bucks no message thank you
[254:48.13]It's weenie.
[254:48.95]Thanks for $5.
[254:49.53]It's weenie.
[254:51.49]Hey, Jerma, what restaurant has the best bread?
[254:59.12]Gordon Ramsay Steak in Las Vegas.
[255:03.90]It just does.
[255:09.95]Subway.
[255:15.63]Gordon Ramsay Steak had the best bread I've ever had.
[255:20.03]It was like a popover with like little bacon bits almost inside, prosciutto.
[255:23.80]I don't even know what the hell it was.
[255:25.62]That's the best thing I've ever eaten.
[255:26.50]That was a bread before the dinner bread.
[255:29.20]Is it biased because it's Las Vegas?
[255:30.60]No, it's biased because it's Gordon Ramsay's, like one of Gordon Ramsay's fucking restaurants.
[255:42.03]Better than the Olive Garden?
[255:49.39]He could only afford the bread.
[255:54.17]That is, ladies and gentlemen, that is why the credit card was invented.
[255:58.73]You know, you get to go into a nice restaurant, and it's a very expensive place, and absolutely, yeah, I'll take care of this.
[256:05.79]Uh-huh.
[256:06.57]I charge it on my card.
[256:07.79]Yeah, and of course, I'm going to give you a nice tip, too.
[256:09.83]I'm an important person.
[256:11.27]I'm an important, wealthy person.
[256:15.08]And they're like, wow, okay, here you go, Mr. Elbertson.
[256:17.48]Yeah, I'll sign that.
[256:18.36]And I got a nice signature too.
[256:19.64]I'm going to try hard and make this a great signature.
[256:30.71]And then a few weeks later, I open up my bank account statement and look at my credit card and I go, what have I done?
[256:36.79]Why did I do that?
[256:38.13]That was a bad idea.
[256:39.25]Don't do that.
[256:40.09]Don't have any debt.
[256:41.23]Then you get to pay the debt down.
[256:42.33]And then you wanted to, you wanted to make the waiter think you were cool and shit for like a, you wanted to take out your friends and you go to like have fun.
[256:51.67]It hurts like a month later.
[256:57.85]Make sure to only make the minimum payment.
[257:01.19]No.
[257:02.53]Don't only use a credit card.
[257:04.15]Listen, listen, listen.
[257:05.11]Here's some credit card advice for you.
[257:06.99]You ready?
[257:08.79]There are two ways to use a credit card.
[257:11.73]One of the ways is to use your credit card and then just fucking pay it off.
[257:18.98]Like on the next period, right?
[257:22.12]That's one way.
[257:22.96]The second way is just don't have one.
[257:39.39]I'm not a financial advisor.
[257:41.17]This is not financial advice.
[257:45.59]But if you are going to have a credit card, just buy something fucking easy, right?
[257:53.50]That you know that you can make payments on.
[257:56.26]Don't be one of those people that takes a credit card out and has like a $10,000 limit and buys a new like liquid plasma display HDTV that's like four and a half grand.
[258:09.52]That's not a good idea.
[258:19.67]Use it to get gas.
[258:21.17]That's a, you know what?
[258:22.49]Pity pockets.
[258:24.15]What a great piece of not financial advice that you didn't just give, right?
[258:30.39]Pay it off, get some gas.
[258:31.92]Maybe like a grocery run.
[258:33.88]Pay it off after a month or two and then rinse and repeat.
[258:36.94]Don't load it up.
[258:38.26]Don't max it out.
[258:45.77]Yes, I'm holding something in my hand.
[258:49.36]But yeah, the best bread I've ever had was probably at Gordon Ramsay Steak.
[258:54.46]A close second would be Pizza Hut.
[258:58.76]Pizza Hut's breadsticks.
[259:00.36]That's number two.
[259:02.54]And it's only like maybe three or four points difference.
[259:19.14]Papa John's has better breadsticks.
[259:25.21]How could you say something like that?
[259:27.47]No.
[259:28.77]No, it's okay.
[259:29.31]You can think that.
[259:30.75]You're allowed to have that opinion.
[259:32.97]But I'm allowed to go, right?
[259:40.24]Hey, thank you to Ahon for the $5.
[259:43.16]Ahon, thank you.
[259:47.62]Here's half the bits to open the door.
[259:50.02]Thank you.
[259:51.30]I'm happy that you gave me the bits to open the door.
[259:53.20]Thanks a lot, man.
[259:54.68]Pocket Pauling, thanks for the two bucks and your gifted subs.
[260:02.01]Hello, Jerba.
[260:02.97]Thank you for being a good, safe streamer with a community where I feel like I'm not hated for being out.
[260:09.53]Thank you.
[260:12.21]Gay pride and transgender pride.
[260:14.89]Absolutely.
[260:24.91]Pocket Polly, thank you so much for the two bucks.
[260:34.47]And thank you for this message.
[260:41.00]Thank you, Upward Fern, for the two dollars.
[260:43.76]Hey, Jerma, here's some of my sweet, sweet welder bucks, honored in 49 out of 50 states.
[260:51.50]Wyoming is weird.
[260:52.44]Anyway, good luck on the move to Vegas.
[260:53.64]You're the best.
[260:54.28]Thank you.
[260:56.56]What a different chat from 10 minutes ago.
[261:05.66]But that's the thing.
[261:09.16]Underneath all like the memes and all the jokes and all the nonsense, this community has a big heart.
[261:15.95]And I know that.
[261:17.31]I'm certain of it.
[261:19.03]I'm absolutely positively certain of it.
[261:25.91]I know that for a fact.
[261:36.02]Oh, shit.
[261:36.38]I just woke up at the end.
[261:38.74]Oh, well.
[261:40.40]You missed a stream here where it was another one of those Jeremy gets in a bunch of like low-level greens and then tries to raid the chat.
[261:54.53]That's pretty much what happened tonight.
[262:08.73]Yeah, that's pretty much what happened.
[262:12.37]Does greens mean weed?
[262:13.74]It can be, if you want it to.
[262:16.32]But thank you Up and Firm for the two bucks.
[262:17.56]Thank you Ape for the $1.
[262:18.96]Ape808 for the $1.
[262:20.16]Happy New Year.
[262:20.82]Happy New Year to you too.
[262:22.14]It's coming up soon.
[262:24.04]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[262:25.26]The vid for this game is going to have to use the VOD.
[262:28.53]There's nothing here without the chat interaction.
[262:30.97]Nothing.
[262:33.05]Well, not every single stream has to be a video.
[262:38.47]I think there were a couple of funny laugh out loud moments, though.
[262:41.21]You know what I mean?
[262:43.03]There was at least a couple, like, funny LOL moments.
[262:53.80]Thank you, The Tickles, for the $1.
[262:55.60]Anyone ever eat scrambled eggs mixed with honey barbecue?
[262:58.54]That actually sounds weirdly delicious.
[263:01.06]No, but you just gave me something to try tomorrow morning.
[263:06.14]No, the puke sounds are just me burping.
[263:07.76]That's not me being upset about that.
[263:11.51]Thank you, Okiehoo, for the $1.
[263:13.41]Great stream.
[263:14.37]Keep it up.
[263:14.73]Thank you, Okiehoo.
[263:16.27]Thanks for the $1 and the really, really, very nice message.
[263:21.34]Trident Jacks, thanks for the three bucks.
[263:24.04]Not sure if I understand bits.
[263:25.34]Just wanted to show some love.
[263:27.36]You really are the best, Jerma.
[263:28.38]Thank you, Trident.
[263:31.16]Seems like you figured it out.
[263:33.24]Thank you for the $3, 300 bits.
[263:34.64]Appreciate that.
[263:35.98]Thanks for sticking around.
[263:39.18]Tridentjacks, again, gave $2 on top of that.
[263:43.42]No message, but thanks for the $5, dude.
[263:48.28]Genpendulum, thanks for the $1.
[263:50.12]Don't you get it, Jerma?
[263:51.21]We are the content.
[263:58.25]Are we talking about entertaining yourselves when you don't like the game?
[264:05.13]I made this.
[264:06.03]I made this content.
[264:09.41]Thank you for the $1, dude.
[264:11.06]Hey, double thanks for the $1.
[264:12.44]Double D, 100.
[264:13.90]Hey, I was wondering if you were going to do bigger budget things such as another live action Jerma Rumble or the other stream that I've talked about when you get to Vegas.
[264:21.53]If so, then I can't wait.
[264:24.45]Yes.
[264:27.74]In fact, there is one that's happening before I even leave.
[264:33.04]So, that is going to happen very soon.
[264:36.78]And there's a YouTube video here.
[264:40.66]Of course, it's the Bloom Bombs from Lord Out.
[264:45.16]This is a classic song.
[264:54.92]I like it.
[264:55.28]In case you haven't seen it.
[264:58.58]It's a great piece of music.
[265:04.88]Thank you, blah, where are we?
[265:06.92]Thank you, Sferg, Sferg for the $1 Jerma.
[265:09.16]You seriously need to go buy stock in water.
[265:13.80]You could buy stock in Nestle, but why would you wanna do that?
[265:17.50]That ain't gonna go anywhere.
[265:22.20]Hey, Pocket Polly, thanks for the $1.
[265:23.74]Gotta get some of that water, waffles, and weed.
[265:30.92]Soft 33 gave a bunch of subs here.
[265:34.78]It just went on my dashboard.
[265:38.76]Thank you, Soft 33, for the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 here.
[265:41.52]Five gifted subs.
[265:43.26]Soft 33.
[265:45.16]Thank you so much, dude.
[265:50.34]Thank you, Sferg, again, for the $2.
[265:55.89]Racist was a suggestion for the Google feud.
[265:59.84]You gotta be careful with the Google feud, man.
[266:03.52]You gotta be careful.
[266:06.05]You can get some wild shit there.
[266:11.39]But thank you, S-Ferg.
[266:14.67]Thank you, Skull Kids, for the free dollars.
[266:17.17]Stream over.
[266:18.05]Perfect time to give bits and wish my sleeping schedule wasn't like this streamer.
[266:24.66]I'm sorry to hear about your sleep schedule.
[266:30.32]But hopefully you get it corrected.
[266:32.04]It's hard to do sometimes, but if I'm causing that stress, I'm sorry about that.
[266:38.49]Hopefully you're not staying up too late.
[266:40.15]But thank you for the $3, dude.
[266:41.15]I appreciate it.
[266:44.41]The Milkman.
[266:45.21]Thank you, The Milkman, for the $1.
[266:46.43]Hey, Jerma.
[266:47.76]Been watching you since 2012, and I just started college recently.
[266:51.52]Struggled with the transition, but coming back to watching you always brightens my day.
[266:55.64]Thanks for being awesome.
[267:00.27]I'm glad that you made it to college, right?
[267:05.15]By recently, I wonder how recently you mean, like this year?
[267:10.53]Hope you do well.
[267:11.61]Wish you the best in your schooling.
[267:15.93]And I appreciate the fact that you come here to watch and you think it brightens up your day.
[267:21.60]That means a lot.
[267:22.26]Thanks a lot.
[267:24.04]I wish you the best in college.
[267:25.82]Study!
[267:27.86]But don't study too hard.
[267:29.60]Study enough and take care of yourself and have fun.
[267:34.09]Don't have too much fun.
[267:39.19]Thank you.
[267:41.77]Thank you, Milkman, for that.
[267:43.33]Thank you, Pocket Pauling, for the $1.
[267:45.00]Dab on those haters.
[267:48.76]We don't dab here.
[267:50.22]Especially on somebody that has an opinion of a dislike on the content.
[267:53.72]I'm not going to dab on the haters.
[267:56.32]Let me tell you something.
[267:57.92]Negative criticism or negative opinions should not be thrown under the rug and swept under the rug as dab on the haters.
[268:08.09]If you have an opinion and you don't like something and you want to express it, I should listen to it.
[268:15.23]You know?
[268:16.43]It's not just all, oh, praise me, praise me, praise me, only as I love it.
[268:21.81]Right?
[268:22.65]If somebody has something negative to say, I want to know what it is.
[268:30.31]We don't dab on haters here.
[268:32.01]We listen to them and we see what they have to say.
[268:35.49]And then we tell them to get the fuck out of here and ban them.
[268:37.95]Immediately after laughing at the thing they say.
[268:51.40]That's the spirit.
[268:57.19]Now.
[268:58.86]I take, no jokes, all jokes aside, if you have a negative opinion of something that I've said or done, or a game, then, you know, it's yin and yang, man.
[269:11.11]You need to know.
[269:14.45]I appreciate it nonetheless.
[269:15.79]Thank you.
[269:18.33]Thank you, npudding, for the $1.
[269:20.49]Thanks for streaming, Jerma.
[269:21.35]Thanks for being here.
[269:23.51]Thank you, Oceans of Isolation of Lotion.
[269:26.49]Thank you, Oceans of Lotion.
[269:27.69]Thanks for the $1.
[269:28.43]How's it going?
[269:30.61]How soon are you moving?
[269:33.17]T--2 weeks.
[269:35.87]I will no longer be in this place.
[269:39.11]I will be out of here.

[269:55.97]But it's a new adventure.
[269:57.33]It's a new chapter.
[270:00.13]Just because it's a different chapter doesn't mean you didn't read the beginning of the book.
[270:04.69]Right?
[270:07.88]That's still a book there.
[270:09.24]It's not a different book.

[271:06.56]Recently went to my three-month appointment and had my hormone dosage doubled.

[271:31.28]I'm not going to say the W-H-A-T word.
[271:35.20]How about I just say what's up to you?
[271:39.85]Hope your appointments go well.
[271:43.55]And I wish you the best.
[271:47.37]He said, no, I didn't.
[271:48.55]I said, I spelt it out.
[271:52.57]I spelt it out.
[271:59.66]Spelling is not saying.
[272:00.84]It's spelling.

[272:18.91]One dollar.
[272:21.55]Two dollars, actually, from Chubby Funster.
[272:24.71]I finally bought a large thesaurus I've wanted for ages, but when I opened it, all the pages were blank.
[272:29.67]I have no words to describe how angry I am.
[272:32.99]A police officer's puppy refused to go into his crate for bedtime.
[272:36.27]He was charged with resisting arrest.
[272:40.39]Leather jacket, thanks for the one dollar.
[272:41.93]Speaking of weird food, I recently heard making French toast out of day old pizza is really good, surprisingly.
[272:50.18]How would you deal with the sauce?
[272:53.30]You scrape off the sauce and the cheese and stuff?
[272:58.37]I wonder how you would do that.
[272:59.21]I'm kind of interested.
[273:02.79]That's weird.
[273:06.25]Heard it was good.
[273:08.31]Unmodded.
[273:12.31]No, that would... You just leave it.
[273:14.34]You leave it on.
[273:15.74]You leave the pizza sauce on?
[273:20.65]Huh?
[273:20.83]I don't know about that.
[273:25.44]I would just scrape it off with a knife.
[273:30.04]Interesting choice of food, that leather jacket.
[273:32.62]Hey, Tom Fullery, thanks for the $4, Tom.
