[00:08.66]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.26]Jerma here, and Boo, and MLC_St3alth, and Cadbury.
[00:14.83]Introduce yourselves, guys.
[00:15.73]Say hello.
[00:16.19]Hey, baby.
[00:16.57]Hello.
[00:18.01]Oh, I did it too.
[00:18.97]Hey, everybody.
[00:20.71]So, on the screen, you're probably wondering what in God's green gravy is going on.
[00:25.13]We're doing an all-heavy man versus machine match.
[00:27.93]So, this could either be very, very bad or very, very good.
[00:32.65]Oh my gosh, I've already lost a full load of health.
[00:35.49]Oh no.
[00:36.83]Hey.
[00:37.55]Oh my god, we need to get the cash.
[00:42.05]Oh, this is over.
[00:43.59]Like, we're not even going to get past the first wave.
[00:46.89]We're all just so slow.
[00:49.35]We're going to get like a D-.
[00:52.05]Oh my goodness.
[00:56.31]I have to get the money somehow.
[00:58.39]Oh no.
[00:58.81]Holy poop.
[01:00.95]Alright, so somebody's gonna have to be on money duty and just go, like, Fists of Steel and just sprint around at movement speed.
[01:06.76]There's no way!
[01:08.80]Oh, there's no way this is happening!
[01:13.18]Alright, so... Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[01:17.64]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[01:22.32]Playing on Man vs. Machine with a bunch of buddies, and we're doing All Medic!
[01:27.31]Say hello, guys.
[01:30.13]Hey, everybody!
[01:31.13]Okay, I have an embarrassing question.
[01:34.48]Can someone please trade me a blue silk?
[01:38.26]I don't have one.
[01:40.07]So we actually just tried to do all heavy.
[01:43.89]That didn't work so well!
[01:45.35]Oh... God.
[01:47.11]Get him!
[01:47.89]Get him, Taz!
[01:49.39]Oh, Cadbury, shoot!
[01:50.21]Somebody shoot!
[01:50.71]Somebody shoot him!
[01:51.18]Oh my god!
[01:51.60]Why does this guy have crits?
[01:52.52]Why does that guy have 100% crits?
[01:54.24]Why?
[01:54.40]Is that a bug?
[01:54.88]Dude, that guy has a legit 100% crits right now.
[01:57.30]Okay, yeah, we're not even hurting them.
[02:11.18]Hey dude, we just got smoked.
[02:14.56]Yeah, hold on, that doesn't count.
[02:18.46]That doesn't count.
[02:22.02]We forgot to buy things.
[02:25.62]Oh man, this is such a failure.
[02:28.87]I just spit all over my desk.
[02:31.33]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[02:33.47]Jerma here, Boo, Stealth, and Cadbury here.
[02:36.33]This is the third time we've done this intro.
[02:39.95]This time...
[02:43.98]We're gonna do Odd Scout.
[02:46.50]Oh, we're not gonna get past wave one.
[02:47.90]I don't even know what I want to use.
[02:51.76]Third time's a charm.
[02:52.74]We will get this.
[02:53.76]At least we have to beat one goddamn round as all one class.
[02:58.64]Like, I refuse to give up until this happens.
[03:04.77]That is the goal.
[03:05.51]Completing wave one is the goal.
[03:08.47]We did heavy, slightly.
[03:10.39]We just about managed heavy.
[03:13.10]I wasted all my hype.
[03:14.40]See, the problem here is one person's going to collect all the money, and the rest of us are going to die.
[03:21.95]Don't let them get it.
[03:23.51]Don't let these bastards get it.
[03:29.09]I think we're actually going to do it.
[03:31.09]Except there's a ton of them coming around this right side right now.
[03:34.52]Oh my god.
[03:35.82]Wow.
[03:36.84]No.
[03:37.66]We're going to do it.
[03:44.79]We're gonna complete this wave.
[03:52.93]Come on!
[03:53.61]Get over here!
[03:57.27]Get your face!
[03:58.91]We beat it!
[03:59.56]We beat it!
[04:00.26]What?
[04:01.34]We got... Did we really?
[04:02.36]Oh, we got an A. How did we do... How did we get an A on that?
[04:07.30]Thank you so much for watching!
[04:08.26]Really do appreciate it!
[04:09.64]Wave one!
[04:10.50]We finally completed wave one!
[04:13.45]Oh my goodness.
[04:14.54]Yeah, but take care, everybody.
[04:15.94]See y'all soon.
[04:19.38]What?
[04:19.73]That's the end of the video.
[04:23.11]That's legit the end of the video.
