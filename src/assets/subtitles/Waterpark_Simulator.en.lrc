[00:34.66]I turned off my noise gate.
[00:35.74]I got to fix it.
[00:37.97]Somebody said that I was getting cut off.
[00:42.19]New computer.
[00:43.40]I'm going to get it fixed.
[00:44.78]But for now, you're going to hear everything.
[00:49.65]I fucking hate that.
[00:50.87]I hate that you could hear that.
[00:54.47]Hey, what's up, Big J?

[01:08.27]Oh, what do you mean he said it?
[01:10.86]The chat is only Big J. What am I, just gonna pretend no one's saying that?
[01:17.33]I just do, oh yeah, that's what every single person is saying right now.
[01:20.69]Okay guys, so I don't, what are you guys saying over here?
[01:27.38]We're gonna play.
[01:28.95]Waterpark Simulator.
[01:29.99]I know I said that today was going to be a sponsor stream or a portion of it was.
[01:33.01]We're going to play Waterpark Simulator later.
[01:35.80]But sponsor moved.
[01:38.08]Not today.
[01:40.00]We'll do it another day.
[01:42.53]So now you got Waterpark Simulator.
[01:44.51]We're not doing any sponsor stuff today.
[01:52.18]about restaurant sim uh chat voted yesterday at the end of yesterday's stream and they chose water park simulator they told me that this is a banger of a game I've heard from many friends that this is you should play this so I'm going to give it a try that's so funny that there are mouth and chair sounds without the I know
[02:22.88]You can hear the chair, too?
[02:24.60]Wait, what?
[02:25.06]Hold on.
[02:28.31]You can hear that?
[02:30.27]If I go... Yes?
[02:33.80]What?
[02:35.76]Okay.
[02:37.70]There's no other sound in the background.
[02:39.04]Okay, how about now?
[02:40.08]Ready?
[02:46.80]Now everything gets masked by the in-game sound effects.
[02:59.53]Dude, you know what I should definitely do?
[03:01.31]I should have like a premium part of, I should have like a premium Patreon for just the audio track of the mouth sounds.
[03:08.40]Do you know what I mean?
[03:09.02]Like, hey guys, exclusive on my Patreon.
[03:14.11]I'm getting rid of the audio track and it's just going to be four hours of my chair sounds, sniffing and mouth sounds.
[03:22.05]That's the ultimate Patreon tier.
[03:30.72]Why would anybody want that?
[03:37.68]Woosh!
[03:38.70]Woosh!
[03:39.22]Right over his head!
[03:40.07]Woosh!
[03:50.66]Alright, let's go!
[03:51.90]You guys ready?
[03:58.42]Okay, now people are gonna think I'm doing that on purpose.
[04:02.29]I've never played this, so I get a new game.
[04:06.09]Do I need to know anything or just play?
[04:09.58]Name your park.
[04:20.06]How about that?
[04:24.71]Is that a little too... I think that's perfect, actually.
[04:28.55]It's the splash zone.
[04:31.31]Should there be an apostrophe?
[04:33.76]Oh, you can't do apostrophes.
[04:39.24]Alright, let's go.
[04:46.75]Okay.
[04:47.69]New day, new life.
[04:48.47]You quit your hated job and used your last savings to chase a dream.
[04:52.81]You bought an old abandoned water park.
[04:55.19]Can you restore it to its former glory or will it fail just like it did under its previous owner?
[05:01.06]Okay.
[05:04.05]Go to the park entrance.
[05:10.56]Okay.
[05:11.78]Who's this?
[05:12.57]No!
[05:15.31]Is my FOV too high?
[05:17.92]Clear the entrance.
[05:19.76]Why are there Left 4 Dead controls?
[05:21.50]Do I have to fight people that come into the park?
[05:31.74]Quake Andy.
[05:36.15]What a mess.
[05:36.63]This dusty, broken down water park is definitely seeing some better days.
[05:39.63]But you're here to change that.
[05:41.75]First, let's clear out the old buildings.
[05:43.64]Use your sledgehammer to demolish the buildings.
[05:47.30]Okay.
[05:52.44]This building?
[05:55.47]This looks old.
[06:00.33]This is not a building.
[06:02.10]This is trash.
[06:09.45]Oh, okay.
[06:13.65]Wait, what?
[06:15.35]Demolish old building.
[06:17.44]What do I do?
[06:18.06]They mean the pool.
[06:19.18]Oh, they mean the pool.
[06:26.41]I'm dead.
[06:27.45]Not exactly five-star cleanliness, huh?
[06:30.59]Trash is everywhere, and let's be real, no one's lining up to relax next to a pile of old soda cans.
[06:36.05]I don't think a pool is a building.
[06:37.40]When it says destroy the building, I think of a building.
[06:41.96]Okay, grab a trash bag, clean up the mess, and toss it all by holding right-click into the dumpster.
[06:46.63]Alright.
[06:48.03]Trash bag, clean up.
[06:52.26]Go to the trash bin and take the trash bag from the dispenser.
[06:59.92]What is this?
[07:01.00]Print flyers?
[07:01.78]Cool.
[07:05.02]Where is this?
[07:07.81]Did I walk by it?
[07:09.43]Go to the trash over here.
[07:15.08]$3 for this.
[07:22.85]Why is everyone playing this game?
[07:24.45]I don't know.
[07:26.42]Everyone just told me to play it.
[07:28.48]I already like it.
[07:29.73]It's already kind of right up my alley.
[07:32.72]Is this full?
[07:40.27]Alright.
[07:42.01]Nice.
[07:42.19]7 out of 10 throw.
[07:44.80]Use your hands to remove newspapers from the entrance window.
[07:49.80]I feel like I'm casting spells with my hand here.
[07:52.39]This is like a VR game where you cast spells.
[07:55.03]This is what it looks like.
[08:05.51]Okay.
[08:05.77]Alright.
[08:07.25]Build your park.
[08:08.33]Can't have a water park without a pool.
[08:09.67]Each pool you build raises the number of max guests your park can have.
[08:13.12]Press B to open the building menu.
[08:14.36]Select a rusty pool.
[08:16.24]I don't want a rusty pool.
[08:20.41]Okay.
[08:23.31]B. Rusty pool.
[08:27.49]Rusty.
[08:28.61]I thought I said rusty ass pool.
[08:30.52]Alright.
[08:35.34]How about like right there?
[08:39.11]You could just walk right into it.
[08:41.55]Is that bad?
[08:52.39]Alright, so that's good.
[08:53.43]B. Now we build it.
[08:56.11]Use the hammer on the placed pool.
[09:03.27]Hey, Jerma, do something entertaining.
[09:05.37]The stream started five minutes ago.
[09:08.44]Time that person out.
[09:13.35]Start timing that... Time that person out twice.
[09:16.13]When the timeout is up, do it again.
[09:22.86]Okay, find the water plug in the pool and close it to fill the pool with water.
[09:31.61]Alright.
[09:33.83]Now we need a diving board?
[09:34.89]Those water physics are slick.
[09:45.81]Wait, is that gonna... If you dive off this, aren't you just gonna hit your head or something?
[09:49.89]That's too far away, right?
[09:54.26]You need a running start to do this.
[10:05.25]You have to like... Let's find out.
[10:14.60]It's time to open.
[10:15.48]Preparations are done.
[10:16.12]Go to the ticket office and open the park with the button on the wall.
[10:20.37]Once you're open for this, start selling those tickets.
[10:22.29]Choose the right time, age, and pass type.
[10:26.13]Print it out and pass it to your eager guests.
[10:28.26]Let them... Really?
[10:29.02]You have to actually... You have to get the age right?
[10:37.08]Time?
[10:47.13]How much time are they going to be in the park for?
[10:50.36]How long is too long?
[10:54.08]There's a lot of people.
[10:59.91]Pass for four hours.
[11:04.90]Here you go.
[11:07.40]Five bucks.
[11:10.29]Six hours.
[11:45.04]I don't want bad points already!
[11:47.60]Uh, if I skip the tutorial, I skip what I just did, right?
[11:57.41]No?
[11:58.78]Okay, I'll keep it, I'll keep it.
[12:01.10]No, no, alright, alright, alright.
[12:04.08]Does it matter?
[12:04.48]Am I in trouble?
[12:10.17]Should I keep going?
[12:10.95]Is it fine?
[12:16.42]The game never saved.
[12:17.98]I'll do it fast.
[12:18.67]I'll do it fast.
[12:22.21]Why did it not save?
[12:39.53]Is the music still supposed to be going?
[12:58.39]If you just come to the stream and you think I'm doing this for the first time, you're gonna be like, what the fuck man, tell him to slow down.
[13:16.52]Good.
[13:17.29]Close it up.
[13:18.27]Good.
[13:28.51]Good?
[13:29.87]Alright, we're ready to go.
[13:38.18]Alright, let's go!
[13:39.12]The pool is too deep?
[13:48.35]Why would the pool be too deep?
[13:52.20]Eight hours, that's too long.
[13:58.04]What?
[14:01.18]What did I do wrong?
[14:11.47]Six hours was eight?
[14:12.59]Wait.
[14:13.33]Six hours.
[14:13.92]Senior.
[14:14.26]You're going to get frustrated if you move too fast.
[14:25.03]I'm just going... Yes.
[14:31.05]Alright, everyone's good?
[14:32.91]This looks like fun.
[14:35.20]Okay, see you in your four hours.
[14:40.66]Ticket cheaters!
[14:41.64]A guest has sneaked into the water park without a valid ticket.
[14:44.35]You can spot them quite easily.
[14:45.31]They're missing a bracelet.
[14:47.07]Push them out with right click to send a message.
[14:58.30]Get out of the pool!
[15:00.25]You!
[15:01.11]Get out!
[15:04.27]Wait, who doesn't- Wait!
[15:05.51]Do you have a wristband?
[15:06.29]Get out!
[15:07.95]Do you have a- You don't have a wristband.
[15:16.31]Oh shit!
[15:17.17]Guests occasionally leave puddles of water when they step out of the pool.
[15:22.83]I'm imagining like a guy in a fucking executive full clothes.
[15:27.66]Clean up before somebody takes a tumble?
[15:31.31]Dude, stop!
[15:33.28]Get out!
[15:33.76]You don't have a wristband!
[15:39.26]Get out!
[15:45.21]How do I make him leave?
[15:47.52]No, he's trying to escape into this room!
[15:52.92]What do I do?
[15:55.23]Do I have to push him all the way out or does he get- does he leave?
[15:59.17]Okay, teen, four hours.
[16:06.53]That guy just stole money.
[16:09.04]I'll tell you to mop this up.
[16:10.62]Where do you get a mop?
[16:16.17]Where do you get a mop?
[16:17.41]I was... Get the mop in the tool shed.
[16:31.15]Okay.
[16:31.89]Lost a tool?
[16:32.39]Not a problem.
[16:32.73]If you drop or lose a tool, don't panic.
[16:34.27]The tool shed always has them in a safe place.
[16:36.40]Alright.
[16:49.03]Got it.
[16:52.78]Okay.
[16:53.20]From splash to cash.
[16:54.80]Swimming's just the beginning.
[16:55.62]Slides are the real stars of the water park.
[16:58.47]but not everyone's a thrill-seeker.
[17:00.49]Make sure to check if the guests want a slide pass when selling... Does this music play the whole time?
[17:08.40]The whole time?
[17:12.83]It does.
[17:17.68]Okay.
[17:18.52]But not everyone's a thrill-seeker.
[17:20.00]Make sure to check if guests want a slide pass when you sell a ticket.
[17:25.11]Offer the wrong ticket and they'll turn around and leave.
[17:28.02]So, do they want to go down a slide or not?
[17:30.94]Well, I don't have any yet, so... This is a big spill.
[17:46.86]Rusty slide.
[17:53.33]I gotta clean up a little.
[18:05.21]Is this a DOOM mod?
[18:11.46]What?
[18:12.12]Somebody just pushed him out of the pool.
[18:14.35]Don't do that.
[18:15.63]No fighting.
[18:17.63]Oh, hold on.
[18:21.78]Is that bad?
[18:24.52]You're fine.
[18:26.29]Hey, how about a free coupon for one water?
[18:32.04]You guys are all good.
[18:32.66]Alright.
[18:43.52]People aren't bringing tr- wait, is there a rival water park?
[18:49.83]They already have slide, hold on.
[18:51.55]This is... Alright, rusty slide.
[18:59.67]I'm thinking right here.
[19:00.55]It's gotta be close enough where they're not gonna get hurt, right?
[19:05.03]Right there.
[19:15.43]From chill to relief.
[19:16.61]Running around a water park is fun, but even the most energetic guests need a break.
[19:19.88]Set up comfy lounges for relaxation.
[19:22.36]And make sure there are toilets.
[19:24.30]Ahhh.
[19:28.55]Okay.
[19:28.67]Did somebody throw- did somebody shit in the pool?
[19:33.14]Somebody shit in the pool.
[19:35.90]How do I get that?
[19:37.08]Wait, somebody must have- Uhh, senior, six hours.
[19:43.86]You don't want to slide, right?
[19:45.43]No.
[19:52.00]Where's my- I need a trash bag.
[19:54.96]What?
[19:55.70]I need to put this down.
[19:58.82]How do I put shit down?
[20:03.59]Drop item, okay.
[20:14.81]Ew, what?
[20:16.01]I'll get it.
[20:19.82]Somebody did shit in the pool!
[20:21.64]Was it you?
[20:26.03]Why is everybody coming over to this?
[20:27.45]You're fucking disgusting!
[20:30.73]Why would you... Are you shitting?
[20:40.00]Better not.
[20:49.34]Okay, pool is clean.
[20:51.98]But what are you doing?
[20:53.12]Why are people so stupid?
[20:57.93]Okay, let's make a place to lounge.
[21:02.66]Make sure you can like see everybody, right?
[21:04.50]Which way is it facing?
[21:05.88]Like this.
[21:07.81]One, two, three.
[21:11.35]And then we need a bathroom.
[21:19.22]I can't make a toilet yet?
[21:20.41]Why not?
[21:25.47]Whatever.
[21:25.81]I got a research point.
[21:38.99]Can I go on my own slide?
[21:40.07]Ho ho!
[21:50.88]Did you have fun?
[21:53.94]Did you have fun?
[21:56.49]It's only... That's the wrong way, whatever.
[21:59.07]I don't care.
[21:59.65]Actually, I prefer it that way, actually.
[22:02.05]What happened to her?
[22:07.94]Slide pass.
[22:09.66]And, uh, adult.
[22:10.98]Six hours.
[22:17.49]Slide pass.
[22:19.37]Uh, four hours.
[22:26.02]Slide pass.
[22:26.96]Yep.
[22:27.76]Senior.
[22:29.56]Four hours.
[22:30.00]No slide pass.
[22:38.65]Five... Four hours.
[22:44.76]Everybody having fun?
[22:49.26]Oh.
[23:00.09]Why is it so dirty?
[23:07.62]Well, watch out!
[23:08.46]I'm trying to get all the dirt!
[23:16.43]Okay, I'm gonna turn... I think I'm gonna turn the music off.
[23:19.87]I think I've had enough of the music.
[23:26.30]What do you mean, no?
[23:27.97]You guys want me to keep it on?
[23:30.24]It's giving me game anxiety.
[23:31.92]I feel like it's like when Mario, when you have like a minute left in a Mario game and it starts playing the I feel like I have to go way faster than I need to.
[23:51.83]What was that?
[23:52.45]Alright, this place is pretty clean.
[23:59.38]Any of the trash anywhere?
[24:02.99]No, we're good.
[24:11.66]Sorry, everybody.
[24:12.80]Sorry, everybody.
[24:13.28]I was trying to do a 360 no-scope into the trash.
[24:24.19]Look, play with this.
[24:31.89]This thing is so terrible.
[24:33.71]How did it get black?
[24:39.22]No, wait.
[24:44.63]Change camera?
[24:46.01]Wait, you can do... There's a third person?
[24:49.41]It's harder to move around like that.
[25:03.00]Hello!
[25:03.96]Slide pass, you got it.
[25:05.49]And you are an adult.
[25:07.19]And four hours.
[25:12.90]I need that mop again.
[25:16.36]Oh, I need a toilet.
[25:19.91]Okay, rusty toilet.
[25:21.99]It's ten bucks a day.
[25:23.11]I'm gonna put the...
[25:45.01]Alright.
[25:51.54]Let's go.
[26:14.67]I'm not trying to hurt... I'm just trying to... Don't walk in front of me!
[26:25.99]Oh my god, you idiot.
[26:34.84]How do I clean this?
[26:38.54]Is this the way it is?
[26:51.27]Alright, I need to print flyers.
[26:58.16]Damn!
[26:59.02]It went in!
[27:04.31]Um... What do I do about this?
[27:11.54]It's two dollars to use this!
[27:12.74]This person can't get out of here!
[27:18.91]Day one.
[27:22.27]Alright.
[27:23.45]Thirteen visitors had fun.
[27:24.70]Eleven visitors had an energized thought.
[27:29.29]Eleven visitors had tired thoughts.
[27:31.97]Nine visitors slipped, got injured, and then there was a low track.
[27:36.32]You need to unlock tipping in the research tree.
[27:40.93]Okay.
[27:56.70]What about you?
[27:59.38]You.
[28:01.26]You need to open the park.
[28:03.86]Where are they all going?
[28:11.19]I just... I pushed a lady.
[28:17.90]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[28:18.44]Before I do that, I need to... We gotta do something.
[28:23.90]We gotta change some shit here.
[28:25.49]What is Y-Pad?
[28:28.57]Okay.
[28:29.54]Alright.
[28:30.46]Hire.
[28:30.94]Bank.
[28:31.58]Ads.
[28:33.02]Management.
[28:34.30]Park management.
[28:36.20]Okay.
[28:40.19]Let me clean everything up.
[28:43.61]And then we're going to change the music selection.
[28:55.49]Okay.
[28:57.41]I don't think I need music right now.
[28:59.04]I think we can chill without it for a little bit.
[29:03.28]Ah, alright.
[29:03.68]Now I can think thoughts.
[29:09.27]Okay, is there a time anywhere?
[29:11.03]Or is it just open it and then it closes after a certain amount of time?
[29:16.84]Can you crank up the graphics?
[29:23.17]Do I have my graphics low?
[29:35.87]Well, why do I have it on low?
[29:40.62]I didn't... Did I do that?
[29:42.36]Accidentally?
[29:51.94]It looks better now, right?
[29:54.44]Actually, it looks... Yeah, I think... Okay, when I was in the menu, I think when I was doing, like, FPS limit, I think I made the graphics low.
[30:21.25]It's funny because I was wondering, I was like, why does it look like the way it does?
[30:30.64]Yeah, so when I, okay, I usually do my settings before the stream.
[30:34.01]So I did, yeah, quality preset.
[30:37.13]I must have made it low.
[30:40.15]Because, see, I enabled VSync.
[30:42.08]This is not default.
[30:43.42]I put the field of view up a little bit.
[30:46.20]Maybe I must have accidentally changed that.
[30:50.71]Oh, it looks beautiful.
[30:56.56]It looks good now.
[30:59.62]Max out the LOD.
[31:03.47]LOD bias.
[31:05.01]How high should it be?
[31:07.65]5.0?
[31:10.33]Whoa!

[31:33.18]Wow, it looks good now.
[31:43.20]Cool.

[31:46.04]I guess it did.
[31:47.70]Look at the park open button!
[31:49.14]It looked awful before!
[31:50.35]Am I just completely fucked up or does it look way better?
[31:55.64]Everything.

[32:17.17]Oh, the park open looks... Right, because now it doesn't have a highlight on it.

[37:05.90]Head over to the research table in the tool shed and unlock the hot dog stand.
[37:11.13]Guests are hungry and nothing hits the spot like a good hot dog.
[37:17.79]The bad graphics music loop, no noise gate torture stream.
[37:29.57]Relax.

[38:18.88]No jumping in the pool.
[38:20.69]I didn't want to blow up your sp- I didn't want to- I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends over there.
[38:29.70]Totally radical!
[38:30.54]You guys are so cool!
[38:40.70]Hot dog stand.
[38:41.82]Everyone loves hot dogs.
[38:45.81]This game is pretty sick.
[38:46.81]I like it a lot, actually.
[38:50.26]I can already tell this is going to be fun.
[39:16.02]You're gonna want to need to go to these quick.
[39:23.72]Stands out of hot dogs.
[39:24.73]No one comes to a water park for just the water, right?
[39:28.55]Sprint across the street to the store and grab a box of fresh hot dogs.
[39:35.95]Okay.
[39:38.30]Let's go.
[39:42.74]Do snap with shift, please.
[39:46.39]That guy's... What did you just do?
[39:53.08]What did you just do?
[39:56.69]I gotta go.
[40:02.56]Hot dogs.
[40:02.94]25 bucks for hot dogs?
[40:08.11]I didn't steal this, right?
[40:12.33]Not all guests are equal.
[40:14.11]Every now and then, a special guest might show up.
[40:16.29]Some loud, some funny, some just plain stinky.
[40:19.74]Keep an eye on them.
[40:20.32]Make sure they don't spoil the fun for your regular guests.
[40:22.38]Do I have to throw them out?
[40:26.37]Do I have to sell a hot dog?
[40:29.53]It looks like one of your guests has gotten cold feet on the diving board.
[40:32.52]Approach the guest and give them a little encouragement.
[40:34.58]Sometimes that means a gentle push so they can take the plunge.
[40:38.28]Once they're off the board, other guests...
[40:42.94]What the hell was that?
[40:43.64]What's an explosion?
[40:48.51]What was that explosion?
[40:52.87]What the fuck?
[40:55.67]What is going on in this game, dude?
[40:57.84]What is going on in this game?
[41:00.30]Why?
[41:01.50]Why?
[41:04.54]Is that supposed to be Queso?
[41:09.23]What?
[41:12.52]Well, I'm... First of all, I'm honored.

[41:28.26]Wait a second.
[41:29.96]Wait a second.
[41:31.91]I can't... I'm having a little bit of a moment here.
[41:40.16]Where's the mop?
[41:44.05]What did I do with the mop?
[41:49.73]Where's the mop?
[41:52.10]Do something!
[41:52.92]I can't!
[41:53.56]I can't do anything!
[41:54.80]I need the mop first!
[41:55.80]I just stomped... I just stepped on that lady's head.
[42:06.68]Are you alright?
[42:14.29]This pool is disgusting!
[42:15.51]Look at this pool!
[42:16.03]It's like, it's got fuckin' algae!

[42:44.26]Probably.
[42:44.72]Dude.
[42:49.49]Why?
[42:50.63]Somebody's drowning?
[42:53.77]Grab a life ring from the tool shed and save them.
[42:58.82]If you missed it, use a med kit injector from your office to patch them up.
[43:02.14]If you fail to save a guest, say hello to an ambulance fine.
[43:10.39]Put this down.
[43:14.12]Here!
[43:14.52]Here!
[43:18.30]Are you alright?
[43:23.35]Oh!
[43:23.64]What'd I do?
[43:41.73]What did I do?
[43:42.49]I didn't mean to do that.
[43:43.67]I heard the water.

[57:17.19]What do I do?
[57:17.73]Oh, no, I need a life preserver.
[57:35.24]I think this person's dead.
[57:40.74]How do I get him out of the pool?
[57:42.01]How do I get him out?
[57:45.73]Oh, first aid.
[57:46.57]First aid.
[57:50.87]Where's the first aid kit?
[57:51.95]I forget.
[57:53.84]Where's the first aid kit?
[57:55.30]Where's...
[58:16.72]Oh, this is why everyone's getting hurt on this.
[58:22.56]Everything is broken.
[58:23.60]I was wondering why everything looked like Minecraft.
[58:32.55]Mustard.
[58:35.24]Just a tiny bit of trouble.
[58:36.58]What?
[58:38.40]Add mustard.
[58:39.30]Fine, here.
[58:39.88]Oh shit, I just did the tutorial.
[58:53.40]Check your task list and get started.
[59:01.93]Alright, sell tickets.
[59:03.13]Build two showers.
[59:08.00]Repair the diving board.
[59:08.98]Repair the toilets.
[59:15.83]These things look like a nuke went off here.
[59:24.17]Weren't they, wait, aren't these things blue?
[59:30.73]Are they this dirty?
[59:32.42]These things are supposed to be blue.
[59:34.82]Careful here.
[59:47.46]Oh my goodness, they are that dirty.
[59:59.05]Is it not possible to hire staff?
[60:03.73]Not yet.
[60:05.94]But I think I can.
[60:09.54]Let me just make sure everything's clean.
[60:11.18]Tomorrow I will have some staff.
[60:16.15]Oh my god, I'm freaking out.
[60:16.75]What do I do?
[60:17.91]Hold on.
[60:22.05]Stop.
[60:22.69]Just wait.
[60:23.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[60:23.86]Nobody move.
[60:28.36]Okay.
[60:28.48]Okay.
[60:38.43]Okay.
[60:40.92]Now... It's overstimulating?
[60:46.59]I think it's great.
[60:49.35]Okay, so I got progress.
[60:52.10]I do have a research point.
[60:55.30]I need to build another shower.
[60:58.79]Cool.
[60:59.09]Alright, let's get everything where I want it and maybe I'll hire somebody.
[61:03.03]I'll try hiring somebody.
[61:18.19]Thanks for playing our game, Jerma.
[61:19.49]Excited to see how your park turns out.
[61:21.33]Actual dev?
[61:30.50]I don't know.
[61:32.51]It's great.
[61:33.23]I love it.
[61:39.09]Alright, everything good in here?
[61:40.01]Did I clean?
[61:40.49]I gotta clean.
[61:40.97]Okay, the pool is disgusting.
[61:46.14]Good.
[61:50.64]Can you please put the toilets away from the pool?
[61:53.76]Uh, later.
[61:55.61]Another day.
[62:08.10]Are these clean?
[62:11.98]I guess they are rusty.
[62:15.37]Then I gotta get hot dogs to restock.
[62:17.23]I gotta do another...

[81:16.37]Do you need to kill more thieves?
[81:19.19]I feel like I'm pretty on top of that.
[81:36.23]I want to go back and see just how bad the game looked before I changed the graphics to not on zero.
[81:44.94]I don't know why I couldn't... I thought it kind of looked good.
[81:48.50]I thought it looked kind of good.
[81:51.15]Is that bad?
[81:57.23]Guys, all the pros play Counter-Strike at low, everything on low.
[82:04.97]I stand by that statement I've made for the last ten years.

[82:38.36]That's cool.
[82:42.59]Life ring stand.

[82:51.62]I can walk faster.
[82:53.30]Okay, what else?

[83:11.95]Oh, man.
[83:20.14]Hold on, yeah, let me... Yeah, there's a lot of keys.
[83:33.94]Dude, should I just read one out loud?
[83:40.51]Yeah, maybe put it in an image.
[83:42.98]Okay.
[83:44.06]One of the mods.
[83:45.38]Looks like Josh, you're the one that just dumped this.
[83:48.28]Put it in like an image and then like post the image into chat.
[83:53.09]You know what I mean?
[83:54.43]So like people can't just snag it.
[83:56.73]You got to like work for it.
[84:04.74]I could just put it in the notepad as well.
[84:10.43]Okay, Josh is going to do 10 different images and he's going to put them into the chat.
[84:16.68]So, alright, save the last two because I'm just going to say them out loud randomly at random points during the stream.
[84:25.95]Okay.
[84:32.68]Yeah, so these bottom two ones, I will, I'm going to start, I'm going to start being a little cryptic about it.
[84:41.06]That's cool.
[84:41.40]Well, thanks for the codes.
[84:42.42]Just dumping them in here.
[84:50.69]Okay, so let's see if anybody can get it when I... Let me just do it right now because my brain's not going to be able to do this.
[84:57.44]So there are three things that you need to know about the world.
[85:03.59]The first thing you need to know is... How are you ever going to know?
[85:08.22]What word... What's the right letter?
[85:11.30]I just, I realized that that was a bad idea.

[86:14.04]Did anybody get it?
[86:14.72]This is the worst way you could do this?
[86:22.70]I mean, the worst way I could do this is just copy and paste them into the chat at the same time.
[86:40.40]It's way better this way.
[86:41.98]Make the last thing a riddle.
[86:44.41]Okay, here's the next one.
[86:46.93]The last two letters or numbers are going to be a small riddle that I'll tell you, okay?

[90:11.70]We could, I don't have like the, isn't there an extension where you can roll and just give stuff?
[90:16.27]I don't have the extension.
[90:18.69]But that's fun.
[90:21.75]There's seven more codes that are going to be put in the chat randomly.
[90:27.70]At Josh's discretion.
[90:31.52]So, be aware.
[90:33.48]You could be the person that gets it.

[90:57.16]There's a code for the game.
[90:58.04]Did we not even say that?
[90:59.72]Did people just think I was reading random numbers and letters?
[91:10.69]No way.
[91:11.25]I definitely said it was a code.
[91:14.55]Alright, alright.
[91:14.97]That was fun.
[91:19.56]Yeah, what the actual fuck was going on?
[91:21.26]Hey, even more way to make it so people that only were paying attention got it.
[91:26.80]Right?
[91:30.09]I want more decorations, but that's money.
[91:33.14]Let's do a water gun because it's fun.
[91:35.42]And I want better slides.
[91:38.83]And let's do all the pool stuff first.
[91:41.65]Better pool.
[91:43.48]And let people leave me tips.
[91:46.72]And then we need... Better toilets.

[92:56.87]Alright, let's get those better toilets in here.
[92:59.77]They're kind of expensive, but it's worth it.
[93:02.01]Look at that hygiene rating.
[93:07.30]Can I rotate the world?
[93:10.37]Okay, yeah, I can.
[93:20.82]Very nice.

[94:55.96]Right there.
[94:59.69]How much money was that?
[95:02.83]And then let's get a rectangle pool.
[95:05.41]Oh shit.
[95:27.22]I don't have enough money.
[95:34.71]This looks great now.
[95:51.64]I'll get it later.
[95:55.59]Alright, I got to keep this.
[95:56.35]Look at how beautiful that is.
[95:59.93]Alright, now I'm going to move this.
[96:09.93]Right there.
[96:16.00]Move these to here.
[96:23.90]You know, just a million people lounging.
[96:36.62]Like that.
[96:38.32]Okay.
[96:39.44]Spin this.
[96:42.38]Look at that.
[96:46.75]Trash right here.
[96:49.81]Don't too close.
[96:52.64]That can stay...
[96:54.11]We're very... There's not a whole lot going on on the left side right now.
[97:00.88]We'll get this away from the pool area.
[97:13.92]I hate these rusty cans.
[97:18.00]This one can go away.
[97:18.98]This one's unnecessary.
[97:20.74]Maybe not.
[97:21.75]Maybe right there?
[97:26.73]Looks so much better.
[97:34.24]Alright.
[97:36.18]Is trash all gone?
[97:37.19]Don't ever go to a place unless it's got two pools.
[97:49.93]Well, this is... We're not quite there yet.
[97:53.77]I need new hot dogs.
[98:03.37]I've got 96 bucks.
[98:12.26]I got timed out by Steam.
[98:15.02]Oh, because you're trying to do the codes?
[98:25.53]Didn't you destroy?
[98:26.35]Oh, the showers.
[98:27.37]You're right.
[98:27.92]Thank you.
[98:31.40]I can't even afford a shower now.
[98:33.59]80 bucks?
[98:33.99]Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
[98:37.23]The first few customers that come in, I'm going to build a shower immediately when they come in.
[98:45.61]Get rid of all this bunch of junk everywhere.
[98:52.02]Can I just delete these items?
[98:53.14]They're kind of piling up.
[98:56.14]I guess I have to put them back.
[98:58.37]How do I just get rid of it?
[98:59.11]I don't want this to stay in the world.
[99:04.74]I keep spawning them.
[99:21.51]Somebody's posted a Windows XP key in the chat.
[99:24.70]Disregard.
[99:34.20]Okay, I am ready.
[99:36.53]So, I'll be right back.
[99:39.33]I'll see you guys in... Like, maybe like three, four minutes.
[99:57.52]See you in a minute.
[100:14.28]I have a question.
[100:15.76]When I do this, is it muting everything?
[100:26.94]That's very weird.
[100:28.77]It's supposed to be coming out of here.
[100:36.74]That's weird.
[100:37.78]I don't know why that's happening.
[100:44.93]Okay, can you still hear the game now when I do this?
[100:55.91]But now you can.
[100:58.47]Oh, that's strange.
[101:00.57]I'm going to have to figure that out because when I mute my microphone, I'm muting the game too.
[101:08.17]Okay, well, I'll figure it out.
[101:09.19]Be right back.
[109:54.28]Hey, what's up?
[109:59.90]Everybody hates.
[110:00.70]Oh my God.
[110:01.20]Stop with the mouth sounds.
[110:02.35]Please bring your noise gate back.
[110:05.61]It was four hours of mouth sounds yesterday.
[110:09.57]We played a game where all you heard for four straight hours was like, that's all that was in the background.
[110:17.34]Everyone was like cheering it on.
[110:19.73]It was cheering, cheering, cheering in the audience.
[110:24.23]I do it once every 10 to 20 minutes and all of a sudden everyone wants to delete my stream.
[110:35.82]I got a hot coffee decaf.
[110:39.25]Settle down.
[110:44.11]It's a nice decaf coffee.
[110:47.46]Oh, that's a nice little seat I got here.
[110:49.90]Alright.
[110:51.62]You ready?
[110:58.77]What was I doing?

[111:09.71]Why do you know that I just brushed my hair?

[125:39.77]People are going to pee.
[125:45.06]I actually like this a lot.
[125:48.30]I feel like I'm running around the mop all the time.
[125:55.83]Change colors, match vibes, and give every corner of your park the personal touch.
[125:59.50]Okay, how do I do that?
[126:05.87]Change color.
[126:08.55]Ooh, okay.

[126:12.70]Okay, I need a floor tool.
[126:15.32]Here we go.
[126:15.62]What do I want the chairs to be?
[126:23.99]That looks like dog shit.
[126:26.06]What did I just do?
[126:27.72]I made it awful.
[126:29.10]What color is this?
[126:31.77]Oh.
[126:40.60]Wait, you can have it be... I think I just want it to be beige.
[126:45.51]Oh, no, no, no, like a light blue.
[126:50.66]These are all locked.
[126:51.82]What if I want to do like a Neapolitan ice cream?
[127:01.75]Wait.
[127:02.26]Material?
[127:02.94]Hold on.
[127:13.23]I think I just threw $10 in the trash.
[127:23.17]Everything's going to be the same blue.
[127:30.10]I'm going to throw away all my money.
[127:38.39]I need to stop right now.
[127:47.50]Alright.
[127:48.46]Okay, so now...
[127:53.94]I can do... I want to get a new slide.
[128:00.17]Let's put this old shit out of the way.
[128:02.54]And I want a new slide.
[128:25.71]Definitely.
[128:30.86]Am I standing in the way?
[128:39.37]Where is the... There we go.
[128:47.12]Can I zoom from here?
[128:58.16]Hell yeah, look at this.
[129:04.90]Nice.
[129:06.44]Yeah, can you ride your own rides?
[129:15.15]Does that mean people can't use it?
[129:21.33]Is this thing dangerous?
[129:39.05]Alright, I'm gonna give you a wild take.
[129:59.92]This game... ...is currently right now, right this moment...
[130:07.28]has reached into the A category.
[130:18.54]If this game had like a stock ticker, it was like 87, 86, 86, 85, 85, 84, 83, 85, 84, 85, 85, 86, 88, 89, 87, 89, 89, 80.
[130:29.16]There was a ton of resistance at that 90 mark.
[130:34.84]It kept getting rejected at that 90 mark back down to like 86.
[130:38.42]It just broke for resistance into 90.
[130:45.33]Alright, I think I'm ready to go.
[130:57.47]Nope, not yet.
[131:09.08]Still a little dirty.
[131:11.82]I can't wait to get rid of these rusty trash cans.
[131:13.53]They're awful.
[131:21.84]I feel like today is going to be a day where I walk around with this and I don't ever put it down.
[131:29.37]Everything's clean, right?
[131:31.93]I think so.
[131:40.11]Ah.
[131:47.77]Oh, I wanted to fix this.
[131:48.89]Yeah.
[131:51.22]Okay, let me move the showers.
[131:54.83]I'm going to put them both 1-2 right there.
[131:58.23]I don't love where the hot dog stand is, but whatever.
[132:16.41]These sound like chimpanzees.
[132:18.19]Are these birds?
[132:26.43]Okay.
[132:28.43]Let me get my shit together.
[132:29.57]I'm going to hand the flyers out immediately.
[132:31.35]And go.
[132:38.10]I didn't restart the hot dogs.
[132:40.20]I'll do that right now.
[132:44.55]I just hurt many people.
[132:58.28]God.

[143:52.09]Hoo!
[143:52.89]No.
[143:54.12]Hoo!
[143:55.14]No.
[143:56.42]Hoo!
[143:57.78]Better.
[144:27.18]Everything's good.
[144:34.57]Yeah.
[144:36.98]Alright, 30 people shit in the pool.
[144:39.60]Is that a me problem or is that a society problem?
[144:50.05]That's not a... What do you want me to say about that?
[144:53.82]Yeah, it's so disgusting.
[144:54.70]We go to the water park and we shit in the pool.
[144:57.24]I'm gonna give a bad review because I'm a disgusting piece of shit and I go to the bathroom at the water park.
[145:03.08]Right?
[145:05.51]But that's my problem as the owner that has to clean it up.
[145:10.61]That's a society issue, not me.
[145:18.06]I got a lot of points.
[145:25.67]Uh, that's not that big of a deal.
[145:30.31]Oh my god.
[145:35.64]You have to pay them daily, but they keep the park running smoothly most of the time.
[145:39.52]Sometimes staff take breaks, and when they do, their work simply stops.
[145:42.91]Keep an eye on that.
[145:48.20]More decorations.
[145:51.24]Okay.
[145:52.58]Now I can do floors and walls.
[145:57.07]And should I do a lemonade stand, or...
[145:59.76]can I should I be faster bigger trash alright so now what first one was real the second was fake let's see what I got what I got uh I want a cashier do I even make that much money in a day
[146:31.42]They're all level 1.
[146:32.72]Why would I... Efficiency 94 versus 67% efficiency.
[146:43.29]I'm going to take the efficient... I'm going to take Benjamin.
[146:46.03]94% efficiency.
[146:50.64]So much more endurance, too.
[146:53.08]Movement speed 2.1.
[146:55.12]He's a little slower, but... I guess the job done.
[147:00.49]Alright, there we go.
[147:01.71]Manage.
[147:02.72]There's Benjamin.
[147:05.86]Yo, that hurt.
[147:10.35]So are you going to be over here?
[147:11.51]Do I have to pay him for today, even though the day's over?
[147:21.61]I don't, right?
[147:33.50]Alright, make sure everything's in working order.
[147:35.06]I might do a little bit more decorations.
[147:37.65]Maybe a little.
[147:52.63]You had over 800, so you definitely paid him.
[147:55.84]Great.
[148:05.78]You can repaint the entrance hut and everything, by the way.
[148:11.85]Alright.
[148:22.95]Would you go to a water park where the staff all sleep out on the street?
[148:28.18]I mean, I would ask what's going on here.
[148:38.23]I'd have questions about it.
[148:45.94]I would definitely ask one of the staff.
[148:47.95]Hey, what's going on here?
[148:52.98]That conveys so many different emotions.
[148:56.04]You'll get anything.
[148:57.12]You'll get any answer that you're actually looking for.
[149:00.49]Hey, what's up?
[149:01.13]What's going on here?
[149:03.05]Oh, hold on.
[149:03.95]Let me explain.
[149:07.24]If you're looking for an answer for anything, that can be used everywhere.
[149:16.03]It doesn't need to be something crazy going on.
[149:17.78]It could be something very minor.
[149:19.44]It could just be a, oh, you know, like this, there wasn't a whole, excuse me, waiter.
[149:27.35]Yeah, what can I do for you?
[149:29.24]Yeah, what's going on here?
[149:32.96]Oh, what's going on?
[149:33.88]Something's going on with the food.
[149:34.94]Uh, yeah, some salt, maybe?
[149:36.60]I'll get you... Yeah, I'm missing my dumplings.
[149:40.87]There's supposed to be five dumplings.
[149:41.89]I only have two.
[149:43.95]What's going on here?
[149:55.42]That's Karen behavior?
[149:56.42]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:58.53]Karen behavior is...
[150:00.41]I wanted five dumplings and you didn't give me the five that I ordered I'm can I bring your manager out here no a simple what's going on here that's a solution is inbound
[150:29.22]That sounded too natural?
[150:31.08]Why?
[150:35.93]Alright, let me play my game.
[150:37.83]What's going on here?
[150:40.35]See?
[150:43.29]It's not about being a Karen.
[150:44.68]You don't do this at the store.
[150:45.90]It's just... Look, okay, if your dog shits in my yard, I can just walk out and see you doing it and be like, Hey, excuse me!
[150:55.77]Do you... Nope.
[150:57.67]Heya!
[150:59.61]Uh, what's going on here?
[151:02.40]Oh, fuck.
[151:02.98]My dog's shitting in this guy's lawn.
[151:05.86]Uh, let me explain.
[151:06.54]Let me explain.
[151:12.13]It doesn't, it's not about being at the store.
[151:13.67]It's just, I would like an explanation of what it is going on.
[151:21.30]It can be used to exclaim, it could be funny, right?
[151:25.17]Let's say you want to have somebody explain the joke a little more.
[151:28.81]Somebody says something really funny.
[151:29.93]You're like, oh, that was so funny.
[151:32.13]And then the, no, what's going on here, man?
[151:39.64]Should I do two pulls?
[151:43.82]This is a Family Guy routine.
[151:46.86]Hey, what's going on here?
[151:52.31]It kind of is.
[151:53.35]It kind of is.
[151:53.79]I fucked up.
[151:55.31]No, but I say that though.
[151:56.47]I actually do this all the time.
[152:03.70]Is it a bit if it's real?
[152:05.01]Okay, we only want three.
[152:57.30]We make them buy something first.
[153:10.89]Somebody said, brah, what is this design?
[153:15.75]This is really ugly.
[153:17.89]Can I get my money back?
[153:23.40]Wait, this is from Jackass?
[153:27.30]This is from a clip from Jackass.
[153:31.83]Yes!
[153:52.50]That guy gets it!
[153:53.72]That guy gets it!
[153:54.86]And this, by the way, this is a 25-year-old video.
[153:59.37]That guy knew exactly what he was doing.
[154:06.09]What's going on here?
[154:08.00]Yes!
[154:08.92]That's amazing.
[154:09.74]I'm so glad that guy did that.
[154:12.26]Alright, how do I delete this?
[154:16.41]That was... They, like, fucking messed up this store, by the way.
[154:21.56]What the fuck?
[154:25.13]God.
[154:25.83]They like, what the fuck are they doing?
[154:34.79]I hate this.
[154:35.33]It's going away.
[154:36.13]It's genuinely awful.
[154:37.45]How do I get rid of it?
[154:39.03]And how do I not spend the money?
[154:42.78]Can I just say I don't want to do this?
[154:49.73]Cancel.
[154:53.20]Shit.
[154:54.30]I think I have to move these now in a place where they make sense.
[154:59.72]Will the sledgehammer sell it?
[155:04.49]Destroy it after building it.
[155:05.47]Well, it won't sell it though, will it?
[155:09.76]It will.
[155:10.28]Okay.
[155:12.82]That's good to know.
[155:16.02]What's going on here?
[155:18.49]Nice Family Guy routine.
[155:31.30]In this stage, this looks delicious.
[155:33.82]I just want to eat this.
[155:37.49]Hey, whatever happened to Switch Wednesday with Squeaks?
[155:41.12]Um... Yeah, it's been... We missed last week, didn't we?
[155:53.24]We did miss last week.
[155:54.16]It's okay, though.
[156:05.03]Hot dog, and then you can sit.
[156:08.28]We need way more seating.
[156:19.81]I need to move that trash barrel out of the way.
[156:22.55]Okay, we got umbrellas.
[156:23.67]We got some trees.
[156:25.23]Look, it's going to be nice.
[156:26.65]Boom.
[156:27.55]Look at that.
[156:30.52]Okay.
[156:32.84]Okay.
[156:33.44]I'm almost out of money.
[156:36.12]I'm out of money.
[156:43.96]I kind of want a different floor.
[156:46.15]But I feel like it's going to be very expensive.
[157:04.65]Is this dirty?
[157:11.64]Alright, thankfully, I don't have to do any tickets today.
[157:14.30]He'll do it all.
[157:15.63]You have to... Oh, wait, do I not have enough money to pay him?
[157:19.31]Does he do it at the end of the day or at the beginning of the day?
[157:31.08]Uh, hello?
[157:43.11]These shitty trash cans have got to go.
[157:44.97]Where do I upgrade trashes?
[157:54.32]That is a poop in the pool, you're right.
[157:57.53]How long has it been there for?
[158:14.55]Okay.
[158:15.53]Looking good.
[158:16.23]I do want to move this now.
[158:17.97]Hold on.
[158:28.79]A little tighter.
[158:29.29]There we go.
[158:31.65]This is moving to this.
[158:33.65]Like there.
[158:40.60]Keep the trash right here-ish.
[158:43.09]Right here.
[158:45.70]Trash right here.
[158:48.52]No.
[158:49.62]Like right here.
[158:53.31]That's fine.
[158:55.35]I don't think anyone's using this one, honestly.
[158:56.94]Alright.
[158:59.16]Looks good.
[159:01.54]Something else has got to go here eventually.
[159:13.29]I think I'm ready.
[159:14.79]I hope I don't have to pay you right now.
[159:19.70]But, before I do that... Maintenance decorations?
[159:31.69]I... Shit, I'm spending too much money.
[159:35.50]I feel like that's a better trash can.
[159:40.05]It's not.
[159:41.84]It's in utility.
[159:44.08]Damn it.
[159:45.66]Okay.
[159:56.63]Floor tool?
[160:04.05]Okay.
[160:04.86]Clean.
[160:06.92]Everything's good.
[160:07.78]This needs a little bit...
[160:14.28]Is there no in-game music?
[160:15.60]I turned it off.
[160:17.54]Because it was kind of making me go crazy.
[160:22.89]Oh, I got to get the poop in the pool.
[160:24.21]Well, it's a can.
[160:24.93]It's not even... Okay.
[160:39.80]Okay.
[160:43.72]Nice and clean, right?
[160:44.46]Let's drain it and redo it just to make sure the water is nice and clean.
[160:58.40]Okay, now empty all the barrels.
[161:00.38]I think they already are.
[161:02.58]No.
[161:04.58]I'll deal with that later.
[161:05.34]That looks good.
[161:13.95]Cool, I am ready to open the park.
[161:19.15]I'm going to hand out a ton of flyers while he works the register.
[161:23.92]So I'm going to try to get like 25 people in here today.
[161:30.12]Are you ready?
[161:37.47]I need hot dogs.
[161:38.13]Yep, hot dogs.
[161:40.47]True.
[161:49.74]Fresh hot dogs.
[162:08.91]Alright.
[162:10.70]I'm ready.
[162:13.28]Let's go.
[162:13.66]Let's do it.
[162:18.56]Does he work?
[162:21.07]Oh my god, I paid this guy $300 yesterday at close.
[162:26.10]And now I don't think he's gonna work today because I don't have enough money to pay him right now.
[162:30.44]You gotta be shitting me.
[162:33.21]This is not good.
[162:36.79]Maybe he has to wait for people to get in line.
[162:46.78]Thanks for nothing.
[162:50.55]What's going on?
[162:56.65]I need to serve somebody.

[163:42.36]It auto-saves, right?
[163:51.44]Respawn.

[164:01.31]But exit to main menu.
[164:04.64]Shove the first person in line.
[164:15.26]Save the game and exit to the menu should be fine.

[169:28.61]Shit's breaking down.
[169:34.40]I need more pools.
[169:35.46]Okay.
[169:38.21]Can I increase how much room I have?
[169:39.65]Can I expand the park by a certain amount of feet or something?
[169:56.87]Everything looks pretty clean.
[170:05.58]You really gotta go to the bathroom.
[170:12.81]And you're deciding to go into the pool.
[170:22.55]Give me the life raft!
[170:24.27]Uh oh.
[170:27.26]Hold on!
[170:28.98]Stay there!

[171:05.20]Where are they?
[171:06.58]I'm gonna put this literally right here.
[171:29.39]Alright, I gotta get trash.
[171:42.98]Are you going to poop right in front of the food stall?
[171:45.21]Are you out of your mind?
[171:47.16]What's going on here?
[172:15.61]Somebody smells.
[172:22.52]Does somebody smell?
[172:25.49]No.
[172:33.73]You play voice of the void.
[172:37.24]I'm waiting for an opportunity where I want to actually dive into that game.
[172:42.70]But I have not played it now.
[172:53.25]Um... Hammer.
[172:58.41]Ticket.
[172:58.85]Guess we'll pay more.
[173:00.11]Oh, yeah.
[173:01.66]Better hammer.
[173:03.38]Alright.
[173:04.12]More.
[173:05.02]Why do people keep drowning?
[173:18.02]Quit throwing your shit in the pool.
[173:20.06]Get some...
[173:32.13]Puddle 1, me 0.
[173:33.73]What?
[173:44.36]I can't wait to have a couple of employees to help do this.
[173:59.32]I need to repair...
[174:07.77]Uh-oh.
[174:13.15]Uh-oh.
[174:19.18]I think I was walking out in a wet suit.
[174:28.67]This is worth doing.
[174:29.45]It's $10 per hot dog.
[174:36.12]We're all having fun, right?
[174:37.84]Everybody having fun?
[174:40.30]Tip me!
[174:41.30]Tip me!
[174:41.82]We're all having fun!
[174:42.74]Tip me!
[174:44.13]Tip!
[174:45.55]Look at how much fun we're having!
[175:06.72]Is this happening faster now?
[175:09.93]I think it is.
[175:16.70]Good.
[175:20.57]Good.
[175:21.59]Everything is in working order.
[175:31.13]I still can't get that smelly guest.
[175:33.77]My park is too clean.
[175:53.03]Quit messing around.
[175:57.32]Hey, quit horsing around.
[176:00.86]Oh my god, I just fucking killed this lady with a broom.
[176:20.83]I only got one... No, I got a whole rack, right?
[176:23.14]Get it!
[176:45.37]I almost got 600.
[176:46.01]I made a lot more money today than ever before.
[176:53.97]I need some coffee.
[177:01.06]Okay.
[177:06.14]That's a good ratio.
[177:07.95]That's a 2 to 1 people had a good time ratio.
[177:13.07]Didn't like the decorations?
[177:14.25]Well, what do you want me to do?
[177:18.02]I got... Did I pay him twice?
[177:20.16]Why do I only have $429?
[177:26.50]I got so screwed.
[177:27.49]I ended up losing about a thousand bucks on that first guy.
[177:30.52]And he didn't do anything.
[177:51.02]Alright, I'm going to take another break.
[177:52.70]I'll be back in two or three minutes after I put down all this stuff that I want to put down.
[177:57.91]Can these get dirty?
[177:58.55]The benches?
[178:13.39]Are you still hired?
[178:15.77]Oh, okay.
[178:16.45]So he's going to be here tomorrow.
[178:18.36]That's good.
[178:21.43]Watch out.
[178:32.42]Maybe I should wait till level two.
[178:39.97]I think I'm going to save the points.
[178:45.39]Lemonade stand.
[178:46.23]Oh, actually, that probably is important.
[178:49.15]Finally.
[178:51.47]Oh, look at this.
[178:56.41]Better trash cans and the park is bigger.
[179:03.60]Holy shit, this is huge.
[179:05.32]I can't open the park yet.
[179:11.77]This is massive now.
[179:14.93]Cool.
[179:15.41]Alright, I'll be right back.
[179:18.22]I'm going to pee.
[179:21.44]And we'll keep going.
[179:23.09]See you in a few.
[183:42.26]What's up?
[183:54.15]I will probably be streaming for like another hour.
[183:55.79]I only planned on really streaming for this morning.
[184:00.22]And I didn't start till noon anyway, so probably like another hour and a half or so, hour or two.
[184:14.86]Play Deadlock.
[184:17.57]I don't... I'm not gonna play... I don't know how to play that game.
[184:28.91]Okay.
[184:30.50]Here we go.
[184:43.95]Alright, hold on.
[184:44.73]Let me try something.
[184:51.72]Are you guys hearing the game twice if I do this?
[185:05.06]Alright, what do you hear right now when I mute this?
[185:16.17]You hear the game.
[185:17.47]Alright, what do you hear when I do this?
[185:29.82]Nothing.
[185:31.54]Well, that's very weird.
[185:33.04]So before you guys heard me and the game before the BRB, right?
[185:45.77]Yes.
[185:49.21]The game is quiet when we can hear it.
[185:56.62]So, but you guys, when it was like, you guys heard all this stuff.
[186:11.41]I am so confused because let me, let me do this again.
[186:13.97]Let me mute.
[186:14.45]You don't hear the game right now, right?
[186:23.57]Okay, for some reason, the game was coming through my mic.
[186:30.43]And when I would mute my mic, it would mute the game.
[186:32.64]But now, since coming back and pressing those buttons on and off, they're now on different channels again.
[186:40.42]So, okay.
[186:41.42]Whatever.
[186:43.05]Alright.
[186:44.57]Alright.
[186:45.21]Let's look at all this.
[186:46.81]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode two of Big J's Pool Party.
[186:54.67]I got a lot to do over here.
[186:56.01]The first episode you saw us get this situated.
[187:02.32]So now I gotta take care of this.
[187:04.94]So let's do it.
[187:07.45]Take a sip.
[187:17.38]Okay.
[187:19.49]Why didn't anybody tell me that?
[187:29.04]Is this a bit?
[187:30.05]It wasn't.
[187:31.62]Alright, let's go.
[188:15.75]How do I like the game?
[188:16.47]I think it's great.
[188:18.68]I think it's super fun.
[188:19.66]I think it's really interesting.
[188:21.26]It seems like you expand a ton.
[188:24.66]And judging by the intro screen and the main menu, I think this game is elaborate.
[188:34.08]It feels like a nice, fun, slow burn.
[188:37.22]So we will be playing this again.
[188:40.35]I'm going to get sort of far in this game, I think.
[188:43.85]At least far enough to stream it another time.
[188:48.24]Because I think it's very fun.
[188:51.66]The next time I'll be live after today will probably be at some point maybe the middle to late this week coming up.
[188:58.61]Maybe like Thursday.
[189:00.31]We'll probably play this.
[189:03.38]And we'll see.
[189:06.76]Wednesday or Thursday this coming week.
[189:10.24]Plan on Thursday.
[189:16.07]The roadmap has a lot of cool stuff.
[189:19.42]Did I see a multiplayer thing in the roadmap?
[189:27.91]How is that gonna work?
[189:43.65]Multiplayer is in every Early Access game's roadmap?
[189:51.80]This feels really, really far along for early access, though.
[189:59.93]If you had told me this was not early access, I probably would have just believed you.
[190:03.08]I'd be like, oh yeah, this is a game.
[190:05.64]Of course, it's a game.
[190:06.52]Here it is.
[190:11.53]This feels pretty complete already.
[190:19.75]I mean, okay, am I going to hit a wall here where in like 20 minutes it goes, thank you for playing.
[190:26.88]The next player in line.
[190:28.10]Am I going to get like the Mario thing that's like, hey, that's it?
[190:30.94]Or does it just keep going?
[190:41.35]It just keeps going.
[190:42.02]So yeah, so that seems like there's a lot in here.
[190:58.87]Okay, I just need the trash.
[191:00.67]I need the trash bag.
[191:11.49]I'm kind of out of money though.
[191:14.37]I don't think I can do very much right now.
[191:18.00]Should I just block this off or are people going to come over here and be weirded out by this?
[191:36.60]Just repair?
[191:37.32]Oh, okay, right.
[191:40.53]I don't think I can.
[191:44.85]No, I can't.
[191:45.38]Yeah, I have to destroy it.
[191:56.52]I couldn't refurbish it?
[192:11.31]Distinct line in the trees are great though.
[192:13.53]I'm gonna keep those Trash bag and that's it
[192:45.72]Make sure it's clean.
[192:46.72]Watch, some asshole is going to come over here and just throw trash over here.
[192:52.63]They will deliberately walk over here to dump.
[193:05.69]Loud steam sound.
[193:14.96]Ah.
[193:17.05]Gorgeous!
[193:29.87]Perfect!
[193:33.79]But I can't do anything with it.
[193:35.43]I got my dude here.
[193:37.23]Everything here repaired?
[193:38.03]Everything good to go?
[193:45.96]I think so.
[193:49.81]Shit's a little dirty.
[193:53.67]I don't have any money to do anything, though.
[193:56.24]So... Just gonna have to do another day.
[194:09.22]Hot dogs?
[194:10.38]I got... Do I have... Yeah.
[194:12.16]25 bucks?
[194:14.27]I'll be right back.
[194:17.82]Are there rats in the game?
[194:19.14]There might be.
[194:19.60]I haven't seen any yet.
[194:29.42]Open the park.
[194:30.96]I need it.
[194:31.94]How have I not seen one smelly guy?
[194:34.68]Oh, I need to sleep.
[194:44.63]Where's the one smelly guy?
[195:02.30]Begin!
[195:02.76]You already gone?
[195:19.25]You already gone?
[195:22.27]You already there?
[195:23.07]Already there?
[195:23.63]Already there?
[195:24.05]What about you?
[195:25.78]Wait!
[195:34.59]Tell your friends.
[195:41.01]Tell your friends.
[195:54.51]It's going to be a popular day.
[195:59.20]Alright, check those wristbands.
[196:00.12]Don't let anybody go by.
[196:12.40]Everybody good?
[196:14.11]Yes!
[196:14.67]Finally.
[196:20.18]So I'm gonna get a star for this or a half star?
[196:29.37]Alright, sometimes guests get thirsty and fast and nothing hits the spot like a good cold cup of lemonade.
[196:35.00]Set up a lemonade stand and turn thirst into profit one sip at a time.
[196:45.61]Don't I already have one?
[196:46.87]No.
[196:47.05]300 bucks.
[197:01.70]Without music, this feels existential.
[197:05.13]It's a water park.
[197:06.69]This is supposed to be fun, engaging, exciting.
[197:13.93]It's liminal without the music?
[197:15.71]It's a water park!
[197:22.52]I think I'm gonna make one for myself.
[197:33.73]Put Mario Sunshine music on.
[197:35.48]Okay.
[198:27.64]Can I get you a drink?
[198:32.65]Hey!
[198:32.75]I'm the fun guy in the line!
[198:34.01]Oh, welcome to the water park!
[198:43.54]18 bucks you just tipped.
[198:48.03]Oh shit, they're morphing.
[198:49.19]They're fusing!
[199:06.33]No fusing in the wine.
[199:08.42]True.
[199:16.08]I so badly want to say Vyahoo right there.
[199:17.94]Just pretend I do.
[199:38.92]Is this how the song goes?
[199:40.07]I don't remember this part of the song.
[200:14.31]Somebody just said, irritating.
[200:19.97]Irritating.
[200:24.06]Where do you get lemons?
[200:29.66]Alright, maybe I should skip to the next one.
[200:45.56]Add a lemon?
[200:48.04]Add ice?
[200:51.72]What did I get?
[200:52.23]I restocked the lemonade stand.
[200:55.95]For an item?
[200:56.63]What item?
[201:07.84]Oh, fuck.
[201:10.42]Take this!
[201:12.16]It's free!
[201:13.74]No, I was trying to throw it at her, which is better somehow.
[201:19.03]Um.
[201:21.91]OK, what do you want?
[201:23.29]I want lemonade and ice.
[201:28.74]I don't know where to get the lemons here.
[201:29.98]This one's empty.
[201:33.63]Restart with the lemons.
[201:38.45]I'm back.
[201:45.52]You got lemons here?
[201:57.97]Who's next?
[201:59.64]I want lemonade and... I want a lemonade and a lemon.
[202:06.33]There we go.
[202:08.13]An ambulance?
[202:25.83]You want everything.
[202:27.23]Everything on it.
[202:35.80]This just became one of the cooking games.
[202:38.90]Mustard.
[202:39.52]Good thing I did it.
[202:41.87]So you had a bad day.
[202:43.07]What the fuck is that?
[202:44.29]Oh, it was... That just gave the shit out of me.
[202:49.12]I thought somebody was going to call with me.
[202:51.08]I thought somebody was going to call.
[202:55.11]I was like, how did I press a button on Discord?
[202:56.97]I don't know.
[203:12.56]No, don't say that.
[203:15.47]I didn't want lemons.
[203:16.57]I wanted hot dogs.
[203:18.93]So is this a corpse of the fool?
[203:21.19]No, it's not.
[203:21.83]Don't fucking say that.
[203:23.36]Oh, okay.
[203:24.22]You were just being an idiot.
[203:40.01]I'll be back for the hot dogs!
[203:52.23]Dude, there's a corpse in the pool.
[204:03.89]Okay.
[204:05.57]Oh boy.
[204:06.25]This room is full of all kinds of bacteria.
[204:13.08]Huh?
[204:17.08]I need more employees.
[204:18.22]I need a dedicated concession stand employee.
[204:28.58]This shit's too popular.
[204:32.14]You need to hire them.
[204:32.88]I don't have any money.
[204:33.61]Oh, what a disaster this is.
[204:37.49]There's a corpse in the... Oh, my God.
[204:47.13]I was going to laugh my ass off if I came over and there was just a person just floating in here.
[205:05.67]There was.
[205:06.23]No, there wasn't.
[205:12.78]Is that why the ambulance came?
[205:15.66]Oh no, that's not good.
[205:16.79]How much does that cost if somebody dies in the pool?
[205:20.63]Somebody's parking on the driving... At your service!
[205:50.20]Let's just empty the trash in the pool!
[206:11.83]Hey, watch this guys!
[206:13.55]Think I can get it in there from all the way back here?
[206:19.78]Oh, so close.
[206:29.96]Use a barrel, you fucking dickheads.
[206:45.92]OK.
[206:46.94]We're good.
[207:03.76]He just needed an alignment!
[207:05.16]He just needed an alignment!
[207:28.19]How are they making so much trash?
[207:29.59]I don't get it.
[207:50.54]Oh, they're getting hurt on the slide.
[207:51.64]It's got jagged edges.
[208:03.46]Look at that.
[208:06.10]What was the fee?
[208:09.89]Okay, it was only 30 bucks for somebody to die in the pool.
[208:19.90]That's crazy.
[208:28.22]Alright, still need to get... I'm almost at two stars.
[208:33.63]Alright, let's take a big scope view here.
[208:41.52]What happened to the music?
[208:46.27]Alright.
[208:54.78]Mario Sunshine is here.
[209:10.37]This music's too stressful.
[209:11.78]I feel like I need to keep moving 24-7.
[209:38.10]I'm so happy that I've made two huge impacts on the stream today.
[209:54.79]Wait... What's going on here?
[209:58.89]Huh?
[210:19.39]This is a 15 minute extended version of Pinna Park.
[210:25.22]You guys want that one?
[210:34.05]Yes.
[210:35.15]Okay.
[210:44.58]Very cool.
[210:45.28]Let's put it on.
[210:58.93]Alright, this one's good.
[211:05.42]This is cute.
[211:05.98]I like this oven.
[211:06.62]I like this one a lot.
[211:20.82]Alright, everything seems to be repaired.
[211:22.46]How is the stock here?
[211:24.24]I need more hot dogs.
[211:25.58]I got plenty of lemonade.
[211:26.38]I need hot dogs.
[211:30.94]Why did I not do the speed?
[211:32.24]Just drop.
[211:55.80]All the trash empty.
[211:57.12]Now I can actually put good trash cans, not these terrible ones.
[212:20.20]Oh, is it?
[212:21.60]What?
[212:21.74]Oh, there's trash in it.
[212:45.69]So is it irritating again?
[212:46.99]Is this irritating?
[212:51.15]okay I should probably have something different alright streamer's choice something relaxing something nice oh dude how about the withering room soundtrack how about withering rooms nowhere
[213:24.28]It's a good one.
[213:37.92]Does this exist?
[213:48.38]Does this exist?
[213:53.44]Yeah.
[214:02.75]To get the Chop Suey MIDI cover.
[214:05.73]I'm not doing that.
[214:07.77]I want weathering rooms.
[214:14.38]Oh, yep.
[214:16.88]Yep.
[214:43.82]I need to get to level two.
[214:44.86]I'm not spending any more money.
[214:48.93]Now this is water park music.
[214:50.55]Yeah, this is my water park, okay?
[214:59.40]This definitely doesn't fit the theme, but it's okay.
[215:05.19]It's a scary water park.
[215:10.30]Running around with a hammer.
[215:16.58]Ready to work today?
[215:19.86]I love it when they come in and have fun.
[215:24.21]My water park.
[215:28.51]Max, is there ample hot dogs in the supply?
[215:31.82]And lemonade and lemons and ice?
[215:36.06]Of course.
[215:40.29]See to it.
[215:43.31]Okay.
[215:45.38]to go down the stairs of life.
[215:48.73]One, two, three, four, eight, nine, eleven, twelve, sixteen.
[215:54.90]I never went to school.
[215:56.08]I don't know what comes after six.
[216:11.82]Alright, I want another pool.
[216:14.81]Oh man, this is going to be so awesome.
[216:26.79]Right against here.
[216:29.17]Yep.
[216:30.98]Let's get two slides.
[216:33.18]And let's make it so they crash into each other.
[216:43.21]Is this evil?
[216:51.35]I don't have any money to do this.
[217:02.23]Shit, it's okay.
[217:22.03]That seems a little dangerous, but I'll move back a little.
[217:28.90]No, people are going to be climbing in that way.
[217:39.04]Ah, yes.
[217:40.72]Fill up the pool.
[217:43.23]With blood.
[218:03.12]Are we ready for another day?
[218:06.34]Open!
[218:15.39]Please come to my water park.
[218:18.57]They have slides there.
[218:24.20]Please.
[218:29.28]I promise.
[218:31.75]That your succulent blood won't be drank.
[218:35.08]You.
[218:36.38]You.
[218:48.42]I dropped a free coupon on the ground for 50% off a hot dog!
[218:54.85]Let's go.
[218:56.57]I'm ready.
[219:01.47]Did I just summon this?
[219:24.98]What about your trash cans?
[219:26.06]I don't have any money.
[219:56.87]Let's take a fucking bath.
[220:19.69]Can I get the- there was a line out the door before.
[220:34.52]Hold on.
[220:35.59]You have crossed the stink alert.
[220:39.96]Where is it?
[221:03.76]That's a good soundtrack.
[221:12.85]Put The Sims on.
[221:18.54]Here's some vintage story.
[221:19.90]Oh.
[221:28.21]Why not?
[221:52.13]Oh, that was a slow burn up here.
[221:54.39]Oh, shit.
[221:56.51]Hold on, I did a little loud.
[222:03.44]Oh, that's kind of nice.
[222:20.24]Did you have fun in that one?
[222:22.15]Good.
[222:23.81]We need more people.
[222:24.59]I'm going to do more fliers.
[222:44.06]That guy just attacked me.
[222:45.52]He just dove at me.
[223:12.49]Oh!
[223:17.85]Fresh lemonade coming right up!
[223:30.87]I don't know why I was trying to hurt that person.
[223:34.81]It's broken?
[223:36.59]Wait, it's the other one that's broken.
[223:56.85]Lemonade and a lemon.
[224:02.02]Somebody said irritating?
[224:07.24]What is not irritating to you?
[224:21.78]But on the DOOM OST, I've done that a thousand times at this point.
[224:42.63]How about the Super Mario World NES OST?
[224:48.40]No, if we're doing OSTs, I'm putting on Turtles in Time.
[224:50.61]I don't give a shit if it fits or not.
[224:54.77]This is my favorite game of all time.
[225:08.49]Oh, I said Mario World Turtles in Time.
[225:11.08]That's not what I wanted.
[225:20.40]Total power!
[226:01.14]Irritating.
[226:02.32]Oh, stop.
[226:18.88]Wrong.
[226:19.48]Wrong.
[226:30.52]Three AF.
[228:20.54]Stop.
[228:23.30]Oh, fuck!
[228:30.97]What is that?
[228:31.29]What is that?
[228:45.12]Stop throwing trash in the pool.
[228:46.66]This person stinks.
[229:01.31]I thought he was going to fight me.
[229:02.97]I swear to God.
[229:03.51]Alright.
[229:18.84]Build five lounger with at least one... What?
[229:24.04]The rusty lounger is dirty.
[229:26.39]Oh, shit.
[229:26.89]Hold on.
[229:31.31]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[229:32.84]I was trying to hit the thing.
[229:36.00]Jesus.
[229:48.81]Nice job.
[229:54.08]Just get in there.
[229:57.27]Just get... Everybody get in there.
[230:00.19]Get out of my way.
[230:11.24]Dead body in other pool, somebody said.
[230:33.57]Come on man.
[231:11.86]Fine.
[231:12.46]They keep falling down over here.
[231:16.42]Come on, Zane!
[231:17.20]Move!
[231:33.07]My toe!
[231:33.81]My toe!
[231:34.51]My toe!
[232:05.50]Alright.
[232:08.51]That's a lot of money.
[232:12.13]Alright, that's it for the OSTs for a little while.
[232:15.54]We're going to shred up game sounds.
[232:24.99]Okay, so I have to do... I got to build five loungers.
[232:30.42]So these things are all toast now.
[232:31.86]I'm going to get rid of all these.
[232:35.76]Somebody's still in the... Are you good?
[232:40.42]Why are you still here?
[232:41.02]Do you need... Can you get out?
[232:57.42]Do you need help getting out?
[233:09.44]Alright, she's fine.
[233:15.53]I am not, though, I guess.
[233:19.45]Alright, there's a bunch of junk everywhere.
[233:20.91]Let's do the thing we need to do.
[233:23.82]Repair everything.
[233:24.54]No, actually, don't repair these.
[233:28.06]I'm going to be swapping them out anyways.
[233:34.41]Alright, I have a thousand bucks.
[233:35.47]This is the most money I've ever had.
[233:47.24]OK.
[233:55.85]Build five lounger with at least one prestige.
[233:59.68]What is prestige level one prestige?
[234:08.07]I don't know it yet.
[234:13.44]But that is definitely OK.
[234:15.06]Give me the I need to get rid of the trash cans first.
[234:20.37]Empty them and then throw them away.
[234:22.07]Very nice.
[234:31.92]Are there hot dogs in the game?
[234:35.28]Uh, no.
[234:37.44]They have, um... Yeah, they're in the game.
[234:47.09]Looks pretty clean besides that.
[235:07.48]This game's so much fun.
[235:17.43]Did I actually... Has it been trash behind here for three or four days?
[235:22.56]It's hard to see.
[235:30.61]Alright.
[235:30.79]I think every trash can is empty.
[235:33.70]Seems like it.
[235:36.17]So let's get rid of them and then let's replace them with the good ones.
[235:39.91]Oh, I have to use the... yeah.
[235:43.26]Sludge hammer.
[235:46.50]Finally these eyesores can go away.
[236:02.02]And then I'm gonna invest in a better floor.
[236:07.34]This looks awful.
[236:10.20]I need a much sleeker, nicer floor.
[236:16.73]Okay.
[236:17.99]Trash cans.
[236:19.19]Let's go.
[236:22.59]So this will go.
[236:23.31]Where do I want to put this?
[236:28.02]One here.
[236:31.08]Yeah.
[236:31.24]Has anybody actually sat?
[236:32.73]No one has sat down once on these benches at all.
[236:37.42]Are they in the wrong spot or something?
[236:38.73]Why are they so weird?
[236:39.63]I don't get it.
[236:48.18]It's a decoration.
[236:49.50]Oh, they don't actually sit on them?
[237:09.22]Much better.
[237:23.36]Now I'm going to tackle the floor.
[237:26.74]Please fix the lemonade stand.
[237:34.19]How did you even notice this was not straight?
[237:40.17]Okay.
[237:46.15]Didn't I just build a basic trash can?
[237:48.03]Why is it telling me to do that?
[237:53.24]You want me to build another one?
[237:54.24]I'm up over here.
[238:08.06]You want another one?
[238:10.64]Okay, this can go here.
[238:22.64]You want me to build more than one more than that?
[238:33.87]There's one by the slide?
[238:36.38]Oh.
[238:45.71]Okay, now... I have so many research points.
[238:56.37]This is what I have to build now.
[238:58.73]Basic loungers.
[239:04.18]Get rid of these.
[239:07.96]These rusty ass ones.
[239:21.74]Hey, look at that.
[239:24.08]Sit back and don't overthink it.
[239:40.41]We're gonna use this real estate for a tanning section.
[239:57.04]I'm gonna run out of money.
[240:16.75]That's a lot cleaner looking.
[240:28.04]This place is turning pretty cool if you ask me.
[240:41.03]One and a half stars.
[240:48.18]Wait, OK, I need 20 more decoration points and I have two stars.
[241:08.39]I'll put a plant somewhere, it's fine.
[241:20.15]Cool.
[241:38.04]20 people can be at the park now.
[241:55.94]What are these doing here?
[241:57.46]Awful.
[241:59.46]You thought you could sneak in.
[242:14.10]Alright, can I, is there anything cheap for decorations I can put out here?
[242:16.96]Something cheap.
[242:18.54]How much is a bench?
[242:28.38]30 bucks.
[242:32.72]I need four of these.
[242:35.17]I can't afford it.
[242:41.72]Alright, this last day we'll get to two, and then I'm probably gonna call it after this day.
[242:55.32]I have just enough to restock the hot dog stand, and I think I'm okay on lemons.
[242:58.77]We'll see.
[243:07.22]Not that I would, but can you rob that guy?
[243:11.30]Just for curiosity's sake.
[243:29.25]Okay.
[243:29.37]Last day, we'll do the cleanup after this, and then I'm going to probably take off.
[243:34.28]Then I'll see you guys mid to late next week.
[243:40.94]Let's do it.
[243:41.72]Turn it on.
[243:53.80]I want 20 people in the park today.
[244:13.02]You're going to forget about us forever?
[244:14.54]I just said next week.
[244:17.10]Like Thursday.
[244:20.85]That's not forever.
[244:22.17]That's next week.
[244:41.17]Come on, two more so I can get out of here.
[244:44.27]I gotta go be in the hot dog station.
[244:45.63]Come on, where's two more people?
[244:57.27]A lot less people are sneaking in now.
[245:05.44]Oh, that person smells.
[245:22.86]There should be an automatic one of these set up and they'll tip me immediately, right?
[245:29.13]Oh, he works here.
[245:33.25]Do you have a pass?
[245:45.23]Didn't you say he wanted mustard?
[245:47.31]He's... Oh, he's a piece of shit.
[245:50.36]He laughed in my face.
[246:16.19]No, you fucking asshole.
[246:17.93]I was trying to get him in the water.
[246:30.51]Running pretty smoothly.
[246:33.53]We need more people.
[246:34.31]Only six people at the park.
[246:35.73]What is going on here?
[246:53.16]Okay, now all of a sudden people are showing up.
[246:58.89]Fine, here.
[246:59.85]I'll get those later.
[247:06.15]I want a lemonade with lemon.
[247:12.52]If only there was a bin.
[247:13.96]Are you serious?
[247:36.80]Yeah, if only.
[247:37.82]If only I could throw my trash away somewhere.
[247:41.61]It'd be great.
[247:53.69]Just looking for trash.
[247:55.41]Yup.
[247:58.65]This isn't a garbage disposal.
[248:00.08]It is a swimming pool.
[248:02.46]Thank you very much.
[248:21.28]Okay, lemonade.
[248:25.95]Uh, ice.
[248:32.91]Hand out some more fliers.
[248:38.38]Good thing I left them out here.
[248:48.51]We're almost at 20.
[249:00.26]You want both.
[249:06.51]These things are getting kind of disgusting.
[249:16.04]Alright.
[249:17.11]Now... Hot dog.
[249:20.49]People get... I gotta clean that.
[249:21.61]Some people get hurt every five seconds over there.
[249:37.49]Get some Dippin' Dots?
[249:38.49]That'd be awesome.
[249:47.98]That guy smells.
[250:04.02]Did I get him?
[250:05.17]Randomized character.
[250:21.38]sure what am I doing I'm walking so weird why oh my god stop fucking around stop stop stop stop hot dog hot dog
[250:53.32]Oh my god third person!
[250:58.13]Ice.

[251:27.57]So who smells trash?
[251:41.69]Oh shit.
[251:42.69]Oh, you're back.
[252:02.78]No, I'm coming.
[252:07.11]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[252:07.65]Stop, stop, stop.
[252:08.25]Hey, I'm here.
[252:22.08]There we go, OK.
[252:24.40]A thousand bucks.
[252:29.15]Not appetizing to have that there, but we're good.
[252:36.25]How we doing on this side?
[252:38.13]Everything's a little screwed up over here.
[252:39.53]Hold on.
[252:42.16]Play with that.
[252:53.32]Shit, I need another employee.
[253:11.11]I need a basic rectangle pool.
[253:18.12]I got so many people looking at me, but there's so many people in the park right now.
[253:35.59]Can I get like a hot dog delivery service or something?
[253:39.10]I have to be able to eventually.
[253:44.40]your pool is broken oh you're right it is
[254:12.31]Yeah, what ever happened to the VIP guests?
[254:14.56]It happened one time, three and a half hours ago.
[254:18.24]Have we seen any other different characters or anything?
[254:21.06]I feel like we've only seen one.
[254:38.52]That's so satisfying.
[254:47.43]I need more hot dogs right now!
[254:55.34]What if I just buy a bunch of them and keep them stocked, right?
[254:58.32]Do they go bad?
[255:13.54]Look at how quick this surface is.
[255:15.82]I was right here.
[255:37.03]Alright.
[255:47.54]Way too many people got hurt.
[255:50.94]That was almost one-to-one.
[255:52.62]People had fun and fell down.
[256:04.63]Okay.
[256:07.15]Let me get these extra decoration points and then I'll be level 2.
[256:18.95]Maybe I put these... These little flowers, right?
[256:24.11]How much?
[256:24.41]30 bucks?
[256:25.39]These give 5.
[256:26.32]So 5, 10, 15.
[256:26.94]I need a few of these.
[256:30.62]Just put them wherever.
[256:31.20]1, 2...
[256:37.98]It's very boring looking over here, but it's going to change drastically.
[257:03.66]Level two.
[257:10.04]That one's easy.
[257:10.62]I do that one all the time.
[257:11.40]Alright, so now that I'm level two... What else can I do here?
[257:23.28]Alright, jukebox.
[257:24.56]Keep the music going.
[257:26.28]Modern pools.
[257:30.90]Finally can change the floors.
[257:35.19]Spray can.
[257:37.71]If graffiti changed anything, it would be illegal.
[257:42.29]I can get people to do the concession stands.
[257:45.50]Better park decorations.
[257:49.28]Janitorial staff.
[257:52.97]I'm definitely doing that.
[258:00.06]Modern showers.
[258:03.32]Definitely vendor staff.
[258:06.32]I'm going to get a janitor.
[258:07.72]I'm going to get a vendor.
[258:10.03]So I can just kind of hand out flyers and push cheaters.
[258:19.80]Okay, so you set it on the... So you got to get some more staff.
[258:23.89]Okay.
[258:32.24]Floor tool, I think.
[258:35.26]And then I'll do jukebox as of next time.
[258:40.13]So that's cool.
[258:42.17]Hey, this thing actually fixed itself.
[258:43.27]Look at that.
[258:45.69]It's no longer a piece of crap anymore.
[258:47.19]It's clean.
[258:48.65]Ooh, this does not, that does not look good.
[258:51.74]Okay.
[258:53.60]I have access to some more staff.
[259:01.17]I'm going to just call it right here.
[259:04.20]We'll pick it back up.
[259:05.12]I'll save it.
[259:08.13]I'll see you guys on probably Thursday.
[259:13.11]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[259:21.63]And I'll see you soon.
[259:28.28]I had fun the last few days.
[259:29.22]I feel like there was...
[259:32.20]We had the fun co-op stuff.
[259:33.46]Not casino, Inc.
[259:34.64]Restaurant Empire was really fun.
[259:37.28]Which I do want to go back to that one as well.
[259:39.43]But I definitely want to continue this first.
[259:42.25]Because I'm just... Kind of into this.
[259:48.58]I will leave it as is.
[259:49.56]We'll come back and we'll continue.
[259:53.07]See you guys on Thursday.
[259:57.19]I got no outro.
[259:58.73]Yeah, no sponsor today.
[260:02.08]Some people are asking about it.
[260:04.05]It got moved.
[260:05.87]It's all good.
[260:06.25]Just need to move it.
[260:09.89]And I'll let you know.
[260:11.16]Because that's the computer stuff.
[260:12.18]So we'll do that when it happens.
[260:14.76]But yeah.
[260:16.24]I'll see you guys later.
[260:17.25]See you later.
[260:17.71]No outro.
[260:18.61]I'm just going to turn it off.
[260:23.06]Take care.
[260:23.62]Call your mother.
[260:24.12]You know the deal.
[260:27.20]See you later.
