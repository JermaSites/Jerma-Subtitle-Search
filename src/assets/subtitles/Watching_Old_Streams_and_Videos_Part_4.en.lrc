[00:01.10]Hello.
[00:03.02]Good afternoon.
[00:04.00]Good evening.
[00:08.38]Good to see you again.
[00:12.37]Welcome to an interesting stream.
[00:15.09]It's going to be like, unlike anything we've ever done before.
[00:20.81]Weird voice.
[00:21.45]What?
[00:23.77]My effects aren't on.
[00:26.11]They shouldn't be on.
[00:27.65]Real voice.
[00:31.90]Yeah, this is my real voice, so what do you want me to tell you?
[00:37.28]I thought I had my sound effects on.
[00:44.00]You fixed it.
[00:44.68]Oh, I did?
[00:45.08]Okay.
[00:48.56]Anyways, today we're going to do something different.
[00:53.57]This is the culmination of the last 16 hours.
[01:02.34]of time if you were not here a couple days ago or not not even like a day and a half ago we were talking about how funny it would be if there was a way for us to watch old videos you know you've seen those streams before right not only watch old videos but all of them
[01:26.02]Have every single stream and every single video I've ever done be available to skip through.
[01:36.08]And what would that even look like?
[01:39.69]What does my entire almost 10 year career look like?
[01:46.45]Did we just get subs?
[01:48.75]Hold on.
[01:49.97]How many subs?
[01:50.51]Was that 10?
[01:52.09]Oh, shit.
[01:53.43]I don't even have my fucking thing ready!
[01:57.61]Yeah, I said it like that.
[01:58.85]Career.
[02:00.95]And we can find out today.
[02:03.61]Because after talking about all that, and hey, wouldn't it be funny if we could just like get a random timestamp and go through a random video?
[02:13.39]Lazy Luke made it.
[02:17.68]Actually made this capable and possible.
[02:22.51]We are going to do something very interesting today.
[02:25.57]Holy shit.
[02:26.75]Hold on.
[02:27.17]Hold on.
[02:27.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:28.45]Before we go.
[02:28.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:34.29]What?
[02:34.59]Hold on.
[02:34.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:39.47]I don't even have my dashboard open.
[02:40.97]Hold on a second.
[02:42.37]I got like seven windows open.
[02:44.34]What just happened?
[02:48.72]Hold on.
[02:49.02]It's loading.
[02:49.42]It's loading.
[02:49.74]It's loading.
[02:50.64]Oh, you know...
[02:54.25]Cazzy gave 10 community subs.
[02:57.93]Thank you, Cazzy, for the 10 fucking community subs.
[03:00.11]And then thanks to Freddy Dredd for the $500 in bits.
[03:08.71]That's 50,000 bits.
[03:14.74]An absolute madman.
[03:16.80]Just a true madman.
[03:17.98]500 bucks.
[03:22.95]Holy shit.
[03:26.01]And then Great Canadian FK Club, 10 community subs.
[03:28.63]Austin Atlantis, 10 community subs.
[03:30.38]It's just, it's the hour of money.
[03:33.20]It's the money hour.
[03:35.14]He's gonna turn into the fucking Monopoly man.
[03:39.72]I should just start wearing a monocle.
[03:41.66]Do they even make those anymore?
[03:43.79]Can you buy a monocle?
[03:44.83]Oh, by the way, isn't a monocle just a magnifying glass that you stick on your eye?
[03:52.11]right?
[03:52.39]That's what it is.
[03:53.92]The only people that use monocles are people that sell jewelry, like diamonders, whatever they're called.
[04:00.16]Jeweler, that's it.
[04:02.18]Another 10 community subs from Labster.
[04:04.04]Holy shit.
[04:05.95]All right.
[04:06.41]All right.
[04:06.71]We got, we got, this is a lot of money.
[04:09.49]This is, this is too much money.
[04:11.89]Freddie, Freddie, that's fucking insane.
[04:13.91]That's, that's 500 bucks right now.
[04:17.78]Hey, any diamonders in chat?
[04:20.42]Any diamonders?
[04:22.26]Am I loud today?
[04:23.04]I feel like I'm loud today.
[04:26.02]Am I loud today?
[04:26.74]I feel like I'm wicked fucking loud.
[04:30.14]Is that better?
[04:31.40]Am I not wicked fucking loud anymore?
[04:35.69]Why am I this loud?
[04:36.95]I'm looking over at him.
[04:40.39]That's better.
[04:41.23]That's not as insane as it was before.
[04:43.89]I'm always quiet.
[04:44.81]Yeah, I'm always quiet, but now I'm always loud right now.
[04:50.93]Alright, so, uh, thanks for the... That's a hundred.
[04:59.58]Oh my god.
[05:00.94]That's fucking so much money.
[05:02.96]That's a thousand dollars.
[05:06.72]That's... Wait, that's five... That's a thousand dollars, Freddy.
[05:12.65]Freddy.
[05:13.75]Freddy, it's a lot of money.
[05:15.19]Freddy, you've given me like ten grand, Freddy.
[05:18.10]Freddy, that's a shitload.
[05:19.26]Holy shit, Freddy.
[05:22.38]A hundred more subs on top of the five hundred dollars.
[05:26.74]I think Freddy Dredd has given this channel more than ten grand.
[05:30.38]Holy shit.
[05:38.25]Wow.
[05:38.47]Freddy.
[05:39.29]Freddy.
[05:41.55]And there's not even a message on this, on the $500 donation.
[05:45.68]Not even a message.
[05:46.94]He's just like, boom, take this money.
[05:49.60]I will.
[05:53.24]Holy fuck.
[05:56.40]It's your birthday.
[05:57.30]Well, it's not.
[05:58.68]But I can pretend it is.
[06:01.88]Anyways, I want to show you something.
[06:04.42]Really, really, really fucking cool.
[06:06.30]So, well, we can take a minute before we start this.
[06:09.42]But take a look at this.
[06:15.57]This is my entire life.
[06:21.53]About 90% of my entire life.
[06:25.09]There's 3217 hours of videos and streams that is linked into here.
[06:34.02]This is every live stream I've ever done and every video I've ever made.
[06:38.78]If you want to know what that looks like, take a look at this.
[06:45.89]This page loads a random moment out of all Germa videos and streams.
[06:50.09]Although there are a lot of main channel videos, they are unlikely to be played because they have such a compact duration.
[06:55.71]Eh, they do.
[06:57.21]Here's some statistics.
[07:00.82]Almost 1,500 total videos, 778 archive streams, and 712 main channel videos.
[07:04.54]So, if you take a look at this, the amount of hours
[07:16.84]Most of the hours I've ever spent on the internet have been from a stream.
[07:22.49]So when I press this button up here, something very magical is going to happen.
[07:27.71]The first thing that's going to happen is it's going to load a random fucking video.
[07:33.40]And a random timestamp in that video across 3200 plus hours.
[07:40.16]What also is going to happen is a timer is going to pop up in the top left corner of your screen.
[07:46.24]That timer is going to count down from two minutes.
[07:48.32]It's going to start at two minutes.
[07:50.40]When that timer reaches zero, it goes on to another random timestamp.
[07:56.65]So, that's kind of interesting in itself.
[08:00.05]But you know what else is interesting?
[08:01.69]If we started to, yeah, maybe decided to play a little bit of bingo too.
[08:05.91]This is over ten years of my life on a bingo card.
[08:14.73]Now,
[08:16.39]After two minutes goes by and we go to zero, we're going to go to a new random part of my entire life.
[08:22.19]How you come into play on this stream.
[08:27.77]Jeremy, what are you going to do about channel points?
[08:29.93]Well, I'll tell you.
[08:32.91]Today, if you would like to add 30 seconds to the timer that is in the top left corner of the screen, you are going to give 10,000 channel points
[08:45.94]as a highlighted message.
[08:47.82]We had to do it as a highlighted message.
[08:50.00]That's why highlighted messages are not here right now.
[08:53.31]We had to do it as highlighted message because that's the only way that the website can pull the data that we need.
[09:00.93]So, 10,000 channel points will add automatically 30 seconds onto the timer.
[09:09.55]But 10K is too little for that.
[09:11.55]I know.
[09:11.85]I know.
[09:12.99]It might be way too little.
[09:14.53]But here's the thing.
[09:15.35]I'd rather adjust up than adjust down.
[09:17.55]Because if I started, like, 30,000 channel points, and then, like, in 20 minutes we bring it down, I would have scammed a shitload of people.
[09:27.66]We're going to find out.
[09:37.30]So we're gonna play Bingo, and we're gonna... It's not active yet, because I know people are just gonna be like, I'll give $10,000 to Jennifer right now!
[09:45.57]So, it's not active until I... I'm gonna press this fucking button.
[09:48.91]We're gonna get started.
[09:50.71]And then I'm gonna turn it on.
[09:54.64]Remember, the goal is... The goal is to... If you want to extend the current video that is playing...
[10:02.49]This is not like, oh, I mean, you technically are extending the stream, but it's for the current video.
[10:09.79]Every video starts at 120 seconds.
[10:15.20]If you give 10,000 channel points during that period, it's going to go up 30 seconds.
[10:19.72]When it reaches zero, we go to a new video.
[10:24.66]So, let's just get a good screenshot of this.
[10:29.10]I'm going to need your guys' help for this one.
[10:32.93]Get a good screenshot of that.
[10:33.94]Because I have to keep track of this too.
[10:42.66]You ready?
[10:46.39]Are we ready to do this?
[10:47.51]Are we ready to start?
[10:49.07]I'm going to turn it on.
[10:49.91]Remember, it has to be a highlighted message.
[10:51.39]Make sure your highlighted message is stay.
[10:55.33]Stay.
[10:56.49]I'm looking forward to this.
[10:57.30]I don't even know what the fuck.
[10:58.08]We could get anything.
[10:58.74]We could get fucking anything from 10 years.
[11:01.45]Are you ready for me to press the button?
[11:04.55]That has to be a highlighted message.
[11:06.53]I'm going to press the fucking button.
[11:07.73]Are you ready?
[11:10.21]Let's go.
[11:11.29]It begins in five, four, three, two, wait, hold on.
[11:23.44]Okay, hold on.
[11:25.15]I had to get the... Okay, ready?
[11:28.78]In five... I have to be able to see this shit.
[11:33.32]In five, four, three, two, roll the fucking dice.
[11:36.72]Here we go.
[11:37.06]Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[11:40.08]If there's anything... Nancy Drew!
[11:41.48]Just let me know.
[11:42.78]Thanks.
[11:43.34]I might just take you up on that offer.
[11:45.88]So... What can I do for you?
[11:49.82]Tell me about... Tell me about Paseo Del Mar High.
[11:53.79]Somebody, it's already, people already.
[11:55.75]Oh, no.
[11:56.63]No, no, no, no.
[11:57.61]Oh, my God.
[11:59.76]No, this is going to be.
[12:02.96]One of the students was murdered in the school last week.
[12:05.80]We're all pretending to be students.
[12:07.92]No, no, stop, stop, stop.
[12:10.80]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[12:11.88]I'm going to make it more expensive.
[12:13.12]I'm going to make it more expensive.
[12:14.04]All right, I'm going to turn it off.
[12:14.88]I'm going to turn it off.
[12:15.50]I'm going to make it more expensive.
[12:16.46]What?
[12:16.60]What?
[12:22.86]Who did it?
[12:24.09]Oh!
[12:24.39]No, no!
[12:25.67]No, okay, turn it off!
[12:27.27]Turn it off!
[12:29.69]It's like three hours!
[12:34.09]That's me, right?
[12:35.43]Turn it off!
[12:36.43]Disable it!
[12:36.99]Disable it!
[12:37.45]Disable it!
[12:40.51]Just special enough to see beautiful women by herself.
[12:44.48]10,000 is too small.
[12:44.98]10,000 is too small.
[12:45.82]What do you mean?
[12:47.10]10,000 is too small.
[12:50.07]I'm wearing contacts that let me see pretty women.
[12:53.37]I don't know you have contacts.
[12:55.75]That's something I didn't have.
[12:57.11]I should get back to work.
[12:58.52]How many seconds?
[13:03.38]How long is this?
[13:05.42]This is two hours.
[13:06.96]What?
[13:09.01]There's not even two hours in this VOD!
[13:11.17]I can't play Barnacle Blast.
[13:12.57]Are you serious?
[13:13.91]That's a shame.
[13:15.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:17.57]God damn it.
[13:25.16]Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[13:26.50]That makes a cool sound.
[13:29.44]Let's find our uncle.
[13:30.46]This is the most boring one.
[13:32.08]This is the most boring stream of all the Nancy Drew streams.
[13:36.47]uncle steve I can't refund bits I can't refund anything for a long time how's your aunt aunt eloise oh my god I should have killed it so much you're staying with your aunt right yes so uh what do you got for me well I was hoping you could debrief me on the investigation oh sure sure sure
[14:04.02]I'm just a bit... Well, my undercover assignments are usually not so... Suburban.
[14:09.60]I can't believe it.
[14:10.64]I understand.
[14:11.70]I can't believe it.
[14:12.80]All right, wait a minute.
[14:14.10]I have an idea.
[14:14.57]Oh, I fucking should have said this.
[14:15.83]All right, listen to me.
[14:16.57]Listen to me.
[14:17.31]I get... I get a veto.
[14:18.05]I get three veto sneezes.
[14:18.59]I get three veto sneezes.
[14:19.69]No.
[14:32.19]Drugs, gambling, or blackmail.
[14:34.48]That's where you fit in.
[14:35.34]I can't fucking believe this is going to be two hours.
[14:36.46]Talk to the students and see what you can find out.
[14:38.74]We think he might have kept information about his activities in a notebook or journal.
[14:42.75]So keep a lookout for anything like that.
[14:44.89]Anything else?
[14:46.53]Bye, Uncle Steve.
[14:48.07]Oh, 10,000 might be too much.
[14:50.27]10,000 might be too much, Jerva.
[14:51.93]And it had to be Nancy Drew.
[14:54.17]Of course it starts with Nancy Drew.
[14:55.85]And all of these fucking Drew crew motherfuckers over here have been waiting for this shit for weeks.
[15:01.92]For actual weeks.
[15:03.46]And they got their opportunity right now.
[15:05.16]This is my house.
[15:08.70]By the way, we gotta pay attention because there's a bingo card.
[15:16.75]What?
[15:16.97]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[15:18.69]I'm just... I thought this was a golf club.
[15:25.83]Surf club is cool.
[15:27.09]That's cool.
[15:33.94]Is this the locker?
[15:34.80]Alright, uh... I don't know this information yet.
[15:44.77]Alright, the gym?
[15:46.19]This is unbelievable.
[15:47.24]Homecoming.
[15:49.66]Add something that subtracts?
[15:51.24]Oh, we don't have the capability for that right now.
[15:55.62]We just started it.
[15:59.20]Alright, what is that for?
[16:10.97]Translate them into Winx instead?
[16:15.40]$10,000?
[16:15.68]I can't.
[16:16.30]No.
[16:16.88]Okay, for a second I thought that their mascot was a sock.
[16:20.68]With boxing gloves.
[16:22.32]Was that a bit- Wait, is that a- Was that anything?
[16:26.07]Was that something?
[16:27.19]On the bingo card.
[16:28.03]Check the bingo card.
[16:28.77]Alright, if by the way, it's going up to 20,000 channel points.
[16:35.31]Grape, orange, soda, cool, or spot cola.
[16:41.38]I would love to have a sip of cool cola.
[16:47.00]20,000 channel points.
[16:48.16]It's probably a puzzle.
[16:49.80]Swat Cola.
[16:50.78]Cool soda.
[16:52.34]Orange soda.
[16:53.26]I am so fucking angry right now.
[16:55.98]But it's like hilarious, so I can't be.
[16:58.64]No.
[16:59.90]I need more quarters.
[17:04.55]Guys, it's already been, like, how long's it been?
[17:07.90]How long is this actually?
[17:09.52]Holy shit, you just kind of... It's an hour and 40 minutes.
[17:23.10]The Hulk?
[17:23.48]You are new around here.
[17:25.02]I play for the Manatees, one of the best teams in the state.
[17:28.46]I leave the others in the dirt, man.
[17:30.34]Soon it's college ball, and then the pros.
[17:33.37]Showtime.
[17:34.37]That's not surprise.
[17:35.13]No, surprise face cam does not work here.
[17:37.63]Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee.
[17:39.29]That's only in the video that we're watching.
[17:41.84]It had to be fucking Nancy Drew.
[17:42.72]Of course not.
[17:43.24]I know what to do if I come across a manatee.
[17:45.08]Why would you immediately talk about how you would fight and punch one and hurt one?
[17:48.70]Here's the worst part.
[17:49.86]Of course not.
[17:51.58]I know what to do if I come across a manatee.
[17:54.45]Yeah, just sneeze and then swim away.
[17:56.89]Seriously, the manatees are a great team at a great school.
[18:00.49]Everyone is cool.
[18:01.23]It's like a 0.02% chance to get Nancy Drew.
[18:03.17]First.
[18:06.20]I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him.
[18:10.56]Sorry, can't talk now.
[18:11.78]I gotta go to practice.
[18:13.06]Later.
[18:15.33]At this point I could just go take a shower and come back.
[18:27.09]I can go take a shower.
[18:29.04]I don't even need to be here.
[18:30.86]Jake Roberts sucks.
[18:31.76]I hate him.
[18:33.10]Oh, okay.
[18:33.88]You know, he's dead.
[18:36.06]Oh.
[18:37.38]Yeah, well, welcome to the school.
[18:39.92]Is that an impression?
[18:40.88]No, it's not.
[18:41.46]How's it going?
[18:43.93]How could I get into Jake's locker?
[18:46.25]I could tear the door off with my teeth.
[18:48.35]But it just might be easier to ask Hal Tanaka.
[18:50.77]His locker was right next to Jake's.
[18:51.81]This is the worst Nancy Drew stream, by the way.
[18:53.67]Oh, this is so bad.
[18:54.21]What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?
[18:56.62]He seems like a cool guy.
[18:57.68]His family used to sponsor the annual football awards dinner until last year.
[19:02.14]You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.
[19:04.65]Wait, what?
[19:07.91]Hold on.
[19:08.65]I'm so lost right now.
[19:11.49]What if it happens again immediately?
[19:14.07]He knows that he's... I'm so scared.
[19:16.71]If I veto this, what if we get Nancy Drew again?
[19:19.55]He talked about how much he sucks.
[19:23.14]And now he's like, oh, yeah, that's where the body was.
[19:30.37]I'll talk to you later.
[19:31.69]That's a psycho.
[19:32.49]Yeah, this is a psychopath.
[19:34.53]Just one veto?
[19:35.73]You, like, checked every box of, are you a psychopath?
[19:38.00]Make it max out at ten minutes.
[19:39.46]Alright, we gotta find, where's this, uh... Looking at the trash?
[19:46.10]Eye test.
[19:47.48]I wasn't prepared for this.
[19:48.64]I'll do it.
[19:49.08]For this to happen?
[19:53.26]Ten minute max?
[19:55.83]I'll do the eye test.
[19:56.51]Let's see how good I do.
[20:04.39]Where is it?
[20:06.13]That's a surprise face, Kim.
[20:13.39]E-V-I-F-O-R E-Z-E-E R-H-T-E-G I can't get over this shit.
[20:23.35]A-P-K-O-O-B-Y
[20:28.49]R-T-C-Z-M-N-M-C-Z-M-N-J-K-O-O-L-K-M-O-T-E-M?
[20:33.67]I don't know.
[20:34.23]B-F-F-A-L-E-E-U-L-K-Y-
[20:56.84]boomer eyesight api so all right I have an idea should we add like go to the dog a hundred thousand channel points to skip no no we can't do that people people no no no no we can't do that you know okay when you when you go okay uh jeremy please cover one eye and do it and you can't do that you do it and then it's like oh do the other eye and it's like that's too many but I can't it's all blurry you can't you can only do this once
[21:26.82]You actually can only do that test one time.
[21:28.44]You can't do the other eye.
[21:31.43]Reduce time.
[21:32.67]We don't have that set up for today.
[21:34.81]You got about half of that wrong.
[21:36.39]10 minute max.
[21:37.55]All right.
[21:38.45]What has it been so far?
[21:42.52]By the way, we're keeping track of everybody.
[21:45.04]It's the light coming back into your eye.
[21:48.13]It's all blurry.
[21:48.93]We're keeping track of every single highlighted point.
[21:51.07]Go to a doctor.
[21:51.65]What are you talking about?
[21:52.37]Go to a doctor.
[21:53.71]Can a mod right now message me how many channel points, how many people highlighted messages?
[21:59.11]What are you talking about?
[22:00.05]I'm fine.
[22:03.88]All right.
[22:05.76]I get three vetoes.
[22:06.50]Go to a doctor.
[22:07.06]That shouldn't happen.
[22:07.94]I forgot to say that.
[22:08.74]I actually was going to say that.
[22:09.60]I get three vetoes.
[22:11.06]When I cover one eye, and then I do cover one eye for long enough, and I take my hand off that eye, and I cover it, it's like this eye that was covered is all fucked up.
[22:20.88]Bro, don't you have a hernia?
[22:22.04]Yeah.
[22:23.82]It sucks.
[22:26.84]You fucking liar.
[22:28.82]Then veto it.
[22:31.26]But I don't... Do I want to... All right, do I want to use it, though?
[22:35.70]That's the problem.
[22:36.60]This stream could be...
[22:38.68]more than five to ten hours long do I want to veto this right now at the beginning you know what I'm saying how do I get the hell out of here all right drink uh but what if I want a I wish I could cool soda or should I get extra pop I'm gonna use do I have to use a video definitely I think I have to use a video
[23:02.59]I'm gonna use a veto.
[23:03.87]I'm gonna.
[23:04.71]This stream is so boring.
[23:07.45]Like, you don't want to watch this one.
[23:08.49]That is a waste of quarter.
[23:09.31]Alright, we're gonna go talk to this... Whatever was it?
[23:15.56]The locker?
[23:16.58]Alright.
[23:17.58]I'm sorry.
[23:22.00]I can't sit here from Nancy Troop for two hours.
[23:24.26]I can't.
[23:24.82]I can't do it.
[23:25.58]I'm vetoing.
[23:26.28]Da Vinci.
[23:32.09]3... 3, 2, 1, Veto!
[23:34.67]What's going on?
[23:41.33]What is this?
[23:42.67]Murderous Pursuits?
[23:45.20]Do a 10 minute stream delay.
[23:46.98]Oh, this is like a multiplayer game.
[23:53.08]I don't think anybody's stream sniping.
[23:54.58]I don't.
[23:56.38]I remember this game.
[23:57.23]I haven't really seen that much evidence that it's happening.
[24:01.26]Maybe it is.
[24:02.18]But there's no way I can avoid that.
[24:03.86]You wasted your Vito.
[24:05.44]I'm not going to do a stream delay.
[24:06.90]You don't want to turn on like a three-minute stream delay?
[24:12.26]How many seconds is ten minutes?
[24:13.42]I don't think I can do that at this point.
[24:16.87]You only get one Vito?
[24:17.75]No, I get three.
[24:18.23]Hey, I'm still playing it, though.
[24:22.45]Like, I still am enjoying it.
[24:23.55]Alright, you guys seriously, like... It's called Presto Majesto.
[24:28.35]I'm not going to use another Vito.
[24:30.28]I have two more.
[24:38.58]Ugh.
[24:39.78]My stomach is eating me alive, but it's funny.
[24:43.69]Keep your eye on the bingo card.
[24:45.15]That's important.
[24:46.43]I don't even know if I can do that being live.
[24:50.31]I think I have to set that before I start streaming.
[24:53.77]It's alright.
[24:54.28]Come at me.
[24:58.86]I really don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.
[25:04.72]30 seconds is too much?
[25:09.28]Tell us about the Boston accent.
[25:11.58]I have two more vetoes.
[25:12.84]I have to get this right.
[25:13.82]Thanks for the game, Jerma, and sorry about the circling.
[25:17.02]Your chat made me do it.
[25:18.34]Wait, so somebody was in that game.
[25:24.22]Make it... 10 seconds?
[25:27.72]What do you mean, chat made me do it?
[25:38.41]No, I think we're good.
[25:39.84]Yeah, I have to restart the stream for a delay.
[25:43.69]Do I have anything necessarily planned for the rest of the night?
[25:46.57]No, I mean, there are a couple of options, but I'm having, like, a lot of problems right now with my stomach.
[25:52.09]This is the second time I've talked about, like, medical issues in two roles.
[25:59.47]Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem very silly.
[26:03.77]I should have put that up here.
[26:05.67]That's all right.
[26:06.77]I think I'm stuck here, I think.
[26:11.16]Am I in queue?
[26:12.62]What am I waiting for here?
[26:15.94]I'm ready.
[26:20.84]Yeah, my stomach is in a knot right now.
[26:23.65]Make it one.
[26:24.37]I am just drinking water and... We're good.
[26:33.53]But we got a lot of fun stuff going on this weekend, so...
[26:36.58]Is this the end of a stream?
[26:38.68]What am I talking like this for?
[26:39.94]Owie my stomach.
[26:40.66]What are you, five?
[26:41.72]Grow a pair.
[26:42.42]Oh my god.
[26:44.62]What is happening right now?
[26:46.86]This is like the middle of a stream.
[26:49.12]Jesus.
[26:52.91]Oh my god.
[26:57.53]That's inappropriate.
[26:58.91]Inappropriate reading of chat.
[27:00.25]Tell me how you really feel.
[27:02.21]Hunter!
[27:05.23]It's not that guy?
[27:07.51]It has to be that guy.
[27:08.31]And I just blew the cool down like a fucking idiot.
[27:11.92]That is inappropriate.
[27:14.82]Okay, where is that inappropriate chat reading?
[27:20.86]Where?
[27:21.34]Oh.
[27:21.78]Floor below.
[27:22.70]Alright, let's take a look at what it looks like right now.
[27:27.57]Alright, I'm going to try to actually win this one.
[27:30.35]Let's go for it.
[27:32.07]actually blind.
[27:33.26]No, that doesn't count for this.
[27:35.12]Take a look at what we got so far.
[27:41.38]Now you guys have been paranoid for like stream snipers.
[27:48.28]I gotta go all the way around.
[27:49.48]I'll put the webcam on so you can tell who the real one is.
[27:54.31]No, but this just looks like I'm like on the same stream.
[27:58.82]Floor below.
[28:00.00]I'm gonna run right into them, I think, if I turn this corner.
[28:02.96]I could just go like this.
[28:04.10]Hunter nearby.
[28:04.82]No, I really thought you would've come upstairs by now.
[28:09.79]We gotta hide.
[28:11.49]Goddamn.
[28:16.19]Is this like the ship?
[28:17.31]It is like a combination of... Isn't the ship like you talk?
[28:20.97]Like text-to-speech and shit.
[28:23.04]This is more the Assassin's Creed multiplayer.
[28:26.20]From what other people think.
[28:29.48]I need to get down the stairs.
[28:32.12]Keep doing it.
[28:38.84]This person is at one of the dinner tables.
[28:42.13]Let's get a good look.
[28:46.69]It's the lady right here.
[28:52.15]Where's my hunter?
[28:54.93]Where's my hunter?
[28:55.93]Where's my hunter?
[29:02.50]Hunter right behind me.
[29:05.35]Yep.
[29:05.95]Sayonara.
[29:07.85]Those who hesitate are lost.
[29:10.63]We got... We need brass knuckles or we need a different weapon?
[29:13.97]We only got ten more!
[29:15.27]Don't say anything!
[29:17.75]There's a delay?
[29:18.47]Hunter's near.
[29:19.11]Shouldn't be.
[29:22.86]Nope.
[29:23.10]Right here.
[29:25.00]Goddammit, I wasn't- couldn't do it in time, apparently.
[29:28.29]You heard those clicks!
[29:30.15]You heard those clicks in the first place.
[29:33.23]Dammit.
[29:34.21]That's not angry.
[29:35.41]I was going like, tickety tickety tickety tickety tickety, you know what I mean?
[29:37.51]I was going tickety, and it didn't matter.
[29:39.07]No, that doesn't count.
[29:39.93]That's nothing.
[29:41.17]Fucking ping.
[29:41.70]What's my ping?
[29:42.26]102 ping!
[29:45.20]That guy had zero- this guy's got zero ping!
[29:54.20]That's not Moulding.
[29:58.44]Moulding is way different than this.
[30:00.64]Not even close.
[30:02.82]Yeah, I'm going to take a gamble here.
[30:06.42]Sometimes your intuition pays off.
[30:10.66]Why is a TF2 video on the board?
[30:12.80]Well, that's because there's a 3.4% chance.
[30:13.86]There's a 3.4% chance to get a German 985 video.
[30:21.73]and a 1.2% chance to get a Team Fortress 2 video.
[30:28.65]Have that disguise on, that's fine.
[30:30.49]For those of you that are confused, let me turn it down a little bit.
[30:33.03]For those of you that are confused, this is pulling a random timestamp from every single video and every stream I have ever done, for those of you that are confused.
[30:44.33]So when we get to 0, or if I veto,
[30:48.95]It goes to a random timestamp of a random thing I've ever done on the internet.
[30:54.95]And the first two we got have been very, very exciting.
[30:58.13]It's been Nancy Drew stream, which I had to veto.
[31:02.27]And then arguably one of the most probably boring streams I've done in five years, which is this.
[31:07.63]Oh, shit.
[31:09.25]And thanks for the stun.
[31:12.42]Appreciate it.
[31:13.14]That person was a player the whole time.
[31:16.60]Hunter is near.
[31:17.06]That wasn't a tuber voice.
[31:18.24]It has to be distinct.
[31:19.32]That's not a strange noise.
[31:20.40]Is that a strange noise?
[31:23.48]No, it's not.
[31:23.84]Is it a weird noise?
[31:26.86]What is this guy doing?
[31:46.54]That was me going like, ah!
[31:48.60]He's on a fucking rampage!
[31:52.43]I gotta hide.
[31:57.57]I need a thing.
[31:58.13]I'm exposed.
[31:59.85]I'm exposed.
[32:00.43]Where are they?
[32:01.13]Lady right here?
[32:02.76]No, that was a rumor.
[32:04.28]That was a rumor now.
[32:06.60]That was a rumor right now.
[32:07.80]Like, in my... In here.
[32:08.84]That wasn't in the... Oh, shit.
[32:10.00]I gotta mute the microphone so you can't hear me.
[32:11.46]You're doing all right.
[32:14.40]I have to get out of here.
[32:15.36]Fuck.
[32:15.92]Oh, fuck.
[32:16.54]Oh, fuck.
[32:17.92]Where are they?
[32:19.91]Just be in this... Oh, you were in the circle.
[32:23.91]You were inside the circle.
[32:29.39]I ran right into the circle.
[32:30.53]Of course it was me.
[32:31.39]All right, don't blow it.
[32:34.79]I got a commanding lead in first place.
[32:36.73]Come back.
[32:37.05]We don't want to hear this boring vlog.
[32:40.07]Well, why did you spend so much money to keep it here?
[32:43.33]I'm right here.
[32:45.81]There is a 0.04% chance for you to get one of the Shmee videos.
[32:50.48]Don't you want to let this play out?
[32:56.94]When you see somebody turn a corner there, I'm just going to activate it.
[33:01.64]One floor below.
[33:02.34]I'm not going to veto this.
[33:08.16]Give me that weapon.
[33:16.74]I want full exposure here.
[33:21.46]Is it?
[33:21.92]It's not.
[33:22.24]That was not.
[33:22.88]This bot is so boring.
[33:26.60]This whole bot is just me going like... Okay.
[33:29.50]Got that guy.
[33:47.48]Alright.
[33:50.20]Attack this guy.
[33:51.34]Walk around and hit this guy.
[33:52.38]Got him.
[33:52.62]Got this guy.
[33:53.88]Should I do that?
[33:55.19]Where's this guy?
[33:56.25]Not sure.
[34:02.37]Pick this up.
[34:05.55]Okay.
[34:05.77]Where is he?
[34:06.13]Question.
[34:06.83]Question.
[34:08.05]Question.
[34:08.75]I say question.
[34:09.59]Hey, question.
[34:10.35]Question.
[34:11.65]Did I get that guy?
[34:13.39]Did I kill that guy?
[34:15.05]Should I go this way?
[34:15.61]What's up there?
[34:18.42]One floor above.
[34:22.62]I want full.
[34:25.12]Oh, that was a player.
[34:26.32]That guy keeps getting arrested.
[34:32.05]Yeah, that was a Jeremy, and I've learned to not be Jeremy.
[34:36.16]What?
[34:36.36]I'm doing a different approach.
[34:37.62]He's laughing at his own jokes.
[34:38.66]He thinks it's so fucking funny!
[34:43.16]This is the worst stream of 2020.
[34:44.42]This stream was, like, 2015.
[34:47.66]So, sorry.
[34:50.56]We can't pull a stream from 2015 and make it worse than 2020.
[35:03.57]Where are you?
[35:04.43]Oh, fuck.
[35:05.51]I don't know who it is.
[35:06.99]Okay, I'm getting out of here.
[35:09.43]They're in that room.
[35:10.13]I don't know where they are.
[35:11.05]The first person that walks in this door is my killer.
[35:15.89]The most improved streamer award.
[35:20.08]I can't be just complacent about this.
[35:21.58]Five minutes?
[35:22.20]Alright, what is five minutes in time?
[35:24.88]What is it, 320?
[35:25.98]How many seconds is five minutes?
[35:29.82]They are right down here. 300?
[35:32.45]shit I gotta make something happen right now one minute left 320 350 what the fuck are you how many seconds is five minutes 300 oh dear perhaps you're not okay
[35:52.10]Alright, we'll keep it, we'll make it 300 seconds.
[35:55.40]When it gets to 300 seconds, then you've maxed it out, alright?
[35:58.38]Here's the thing though, some of you guys are going to be pretty upset by this.
[36:01.90]Alright, alright, 300 seconds is the max.
[36:06.94]When you hit 300 seconds, it triggers, it triggers the fucking kill swing.
[36:25.49]What the fuck?
[36:26.29]10 minutes is better.
[36:26.85]Alright, if you want 5 minutes, press 1.
[36:28.51]If you want 10 minutes, press 2.
[36:31.74]So I can't hit that guy.
[36:46.66]got it I had it that was mine that was me oh my god five minutes it is at 300 seconds you're gonna trip it murderous arts I can do this I can control this don't worry all right well now for future I didn't know that like I thought that even if they're getting arrested okay I could like so here we go because then I'm technically still there quarry right
[37:13.81]every single one is gonna get to 300 well you don't know that I thought that even if they get arrested like I can go up and hit them because that it's like they got stunned no the stream is this this like what we're watching right now what a bunch of dog wait the guard yeah get the get the guards out of the game pointless
[37:55.98]Mad.
[37:58.10]What purpose do the guards serve?
[38:00.83]I don't see a purpose for the guards.
[38:02.19]I don't.
[38:16.31]I'm just silent right now.
[38:18.51]That's how you can tell when I'm actually upset about something.
[38:21.00]When I just sit there.
[38:21.78]And I just sit there quiet.
[38:25.88]For more than 20 to 30 straight seconds.
[38:27.62]We haven't changed in five years.
[38:28.58]You guys have been the same for the last decade!
[38:46.06]It's been more than 300 seconds.
[38:47.08]Skip this.
[38:47.46]If counter is in the game, the guard seems like the most meaningless addition.
[38:52.46]No, because people are going to count that as a veto.
[38:54.52]Wait, where's my... What?
[38:58.07]What?
[38:58.45]Oh.
[38:59.09]Okay, that's not my mouse.
[39:00.07]That's his mouse.
[39:02.17]People are going to come back and count this as a veto.
[39:05.63]No one's going to count this as a veto?
[39:08.93]You sure?
[39:09.32]Here we go.
[39:13.66]Attract.
[39:19.65]She's ready to go on a date.
[39:25.41]Let's get this right.
[39:27.09]The egomaniac stream?
[39:29.07]Bridget has a dog named Beefcakes, whom she loves more than anything else in the world.
[39:34.76]Beefcakes is a presumptuous pet.
[39:37.38]He is fond of removing pieces of your body that he presumes to be of no use to you.
[39:40.98]Well, now you've capped it out.
[39:43.11]These have included on various occasions pieces of arm, leg, toe... I just watched this broad.
[39:47.51]...whatever else happens to fall into his cavernous jaws.
[39:50.85]Bridget is thankful that Beefcake likes you so.
[39:53.93]What do you think about this?
[39:59.88]I should keep quiet.
[40:00.96]If it ever came down to a choice between me and Beefcakes, I would be the one in the doghouse.
[40:04.92]Alright, pay attention now.
[40:06.16]I'm going to poison that animal one day.
[40:07.92]It's just a matter of time.
[40:10.88]I'm going to ask that beefcakes be kept in another part of the house while I am visiting.
[40:15.78]Why?
[40:16.44]These are so extreme.
[40:20.83]I'm going to poison.
[40:22.17]I'm saying this to her.
[40:23.77]These are spoilers.
[40:24.53]But what?
[40:24.93]The stream from two years ago?
[40:26.77]Matter of time.
[40:27.67]Why would I say that?
[40:30.98]Can you guys still read that?
[40:32.28]Is that still legible?
[40:33.24]Like, can you still read this?
[40:34.36]No.
[40:35.85]be quiet wimp by the time the two of you get serious you may be missing one of your most valuable parts what the fuck you want me to say if I was gonna poison your dog this is like mad again no what veto the spoilers while on a date with bridget you've discovered that you've forgotten your wallet what will you do
[41:00.94]No, be quiet.
[41:01.38]All right, I'm out of here.
[41:03.85]Excuse yourself.
[41:04.55]Tell the story to the restaurant owner and ask if he will give you an IOU.
[41:08.35]Excuse yourself.
[41:09.21]Drive home or to the bank.
[41:10.98]Get money and come back.
[41:15.14]Ever think of trying out for the Olympic decathlon?
[41:17.72]It's only a few more events than you've had to perform tonight.
[41:21.10]Bridget gets a bit suspicious when she notices that the car is parked in a different spot.
[41:26.50]I'm surprised that in three streams we have no... Your chest heaving while you try to catch your breath is very romantic.
[41:32.72]We have no look at me, which is kind of odd.
[41:37.97]Can I get something to go right here romantically?
[41:40.89]Is that wrong?
[41:41.55]Richard admits that every so often when the two of you are being romantic, she makes believe that you are a famous movie star.
[41:49.82]How do you feel about this?
[41:51.44]No, that doesn't count.
[41:52.36]I have to do it.
[41:53.06]That's fine.
[41:55.73]Does that count?
[41:57.03]That's okay.
[41:58.61]That's fine.
[41:59.17]Can you date me?
[41:59.97]Can we go study?
[42:00.73]Can you be my wife now?
[42:02.42]Actually, this is quite a common way for people, both men and women, to add variety to their relationship.
[42:06.10]The ultimate in recycling content.
[42:08.42]I'm glad you were open enough to accept it.
[42:10.90]Now, what if I told you that the name of the famous movie star is Flipper?
[42:14.80]I'm just kidding.
[42:15.47]No, I'm just kidding.
[42:16.15]That would be fucked up.
[42:20.09]All right.
[42:20.43]Another good date?
[42:24.51]Here we go.
[42:26.28]Can this stream be on the random video player?
[42:28.52]I don't think so.
[42:31.00]The two of you are very cozy.
[42:33.08]Bridget begins to get very romantic and respond in kind.
[42:37.42]She explains that she would really like to make love with you, but doesn't have any birth control.
[42:41.60]What will you do?
[42:44.56]Suggest that you satisfy each other without intercourse.
[42:47.21]By the way, if we filled out this video, I'm giving 500 community stuff.
[42:51.49]Is she going to be mad about me driving and the car going to be parked in a different place?
[43:08.90]I'm gonna get fucking flagged for this shit.
[43:14.97]After 35 minutes of searching, you finally find a drugstore that is open late.
[43:20.67]Laughing Fit?
[43:21.25]No, no, no.
[43:21.75]Laughing Fit has to be like... She purchased the condoms and walked back to Bridget's house.
[43:24.68]She's falling asleep in the living room and does not answer the door.
[43:28.80]Fucking goddammit.
[43:35.66]Don't you work at the drugstore?
[43:37.32]Here we go.
[43:37.86]We're about to move.
[43:40.00]We're moving.
[43:41.68]As often happens in relationships, Bridget begins to gain access to your personal life.
[43:46.58]Want to know what she finds out?
[43:49.12]Yeah, what is it?
[43:51.15]She finds out that you still play with toy books when you sit in the bathtub.
[43:56.91]Now that's personal.
[43:59.83]Does she know about the real boat?
[44:01.79]That's in the bay.
[44:03.17]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[44:07.58]You're really trying to stick that into my gut, aren't you?
[44:10.26]Close.
[44:10.90]Go steady.
[44:12.94]You and Bridget make a handsome couple, okay?
[44:17.43]We gotta live together.
[44:19.71]No, we're going on a date.
[44:23.85]Bridget has an annoying habit that grates on your nerves.
[44:26.54]Here we go.
[44:27.34]I don't even like this person.
[44:29.34]I just want to get married.
[44:30.40]Where are we going?
[44:31.90]When you go out to a restaurant, she licks her fingers at the table and sometimes makes loud sucking noises.
[44:37.45]What do you intend to do about this?
[44:38.63]That's fucking gross.
[44:40.47]Three seconds.
[44:41.13]Here we go.
[44:47.38]Oh!
[44:47.50]This is an old one.
[44:48.22]Ah, you tripped it.
[44:49.98]Unbelievable.
[45:10.71]this is how old is this one the sheer strength of will 2k 17. and he's going to turn the tables he turns the tables immediately after getting almost a new and here comes the snattercat snattercat's in the ring now just praying nobody can see him he's invisible right now nobody knows where he is they can't even tell he's there
[45:30.53]And that's how you'd make a reversal.
[45:32.57]That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you turn the tide of an entire game.
[45:37.85]Stamp on the bingo card.
[45:39.34]As the Snaticat now makes himself visible to Orson Welles, who is in a little bit of trouble here.
[45:47.47]This is the first live rumble, isn't it?
[45:50.83]It has to be.
[45:51.59]Yeah, when you see an air serpent, you know it's at least three or four years old.
[46:15.75]uh guys I think there's like three boys service left is orson wells gets a dropkick no he's still in it easiest content ever was just making seven of these guys after a huge smatacat dropkick he gets up with a chin buster he was like holy I could just have 10 people be the same person he's still in it he's kissing the kissing the elbow
[46:39.01]Might get to see another elimination here.
[46:40.75]Could see a easy peat elimination.
[46:44.12]It's possible.
[46:46.16]Who even wins this?
[46:50.31]You know, you could take that opportunity to attack him.
[46:53.17]Why fucking keep doing that?
[46:55.61]And here comes the Tooth Goblin.
[46:57.97]Half these characters are sorcery related.
[47:02.21]He's like just in a bit of rage.
[47:04.49]He's seeing red right now for the Tooth Goblin.
[47:07.07]He hates this fucking spell.
[47:08.99]He's just destroying it right now.
[47:11.11]He came in the ring like a bull in a giant shop.
[47:13.23]Just started smashing.
[47:16.21]Derma Rumble Charity Edition.
[47:18.87]Should be within the next few weeks.
[47:20.15]Oh.
[47:20.25]Too bad, EZP.
[47:20.67]Ad should be on the bingo card.
[47:23.17]It is.
[47:48.06]It's so funny to see in the... Yeah.
[47:54.40]Oh, no.
[47:54.90]Does that... Does that count as making the same joke?
[48:03.57]Does that count as making the same joke within the last week?
[48:08.05]No, it doesn't, right?
[48:09.37]That's not a joke.
[48:10.05]That's a reference, is it?
[48:11.21]No.
[48:19.00]How do you pick him up?
[48:20.66]How can you have that much?
[48:22.10]I don't think that counts.
[48:23.38]To do this.
[48:24.42]It's a reference.
[48:26.00]He's wicked into doing push-ups.
[48:28.32]Whether on top of somebody, next to somebody.
[48:31.74]Well, that don't count.
[48:32.44]While they're in his hands.
[48:36.33]Oh, the goblin.
[48:37.25]The tooth goblin has an opportunity.
[48:38.89]No.
[48:39.33]It was an observation.
[48:40.13]There you go.
[48:40.43]Yeah, exactly.
[48:40.97]Dr. Roker's not taking that shit.
[48:44.07]In comes the next contestant.
[48:46.81]Who wins?
[48:47.47]No, no, no.
[48:47.97]James Madison.
[48:49.71]James Madison, with his appearance, came in around the same time last time.
[48:53.77]There had to be a president in every one.
[48:56.27]Snap suplex there, right under Orson Welles.
[48:59.07]I can't believe I almost sat there for two hours.
[49:03.27]He was like a ninth president or something.
[49:05.87]For Dancy Drew.
[49:07.93]I'm so glad I used DeVito.
[49:09.39]Sidewalk slam there onto the Tooth Goblin by Dr. Oaker.
[49:14.18]The Air Serpent is currently...
[49:16.71]no he's all right he just jumped and landed on top and did a bulldog I think that was scammed a bunch of people I had to do it I had to do it who just punched the air serpent I don't know the air serpent's crawling now as if like he's got like no nothing nothing on this one guys here he is here's the guy I have no idea who the is
[49:42.65]Here's the mystery guy.
[49:44.79]Crash incoming.
[49:45.95]If it's going to happen, it's going to happen like right now.
[49:47.65]You know what's ridiculous?
[49:49.65]Drew Crew was going to be a slot on here.
[49:51.89]And it would have been instantly circled.
[49:55.41]James Madison has Orson Welles.
[49:56.95]And Orson Welles is gone.
[49:59.61]That is a big right hook into Orson Welles' face.
[50:02.69]Because there was like no way it was going to happen.
[50:04.65]And somehow Dr. Roker found himself onto the ground.
[50:08.24]The Air Serpent, Dr. Ochre, James Madison, Mystery Man, and Tooth Goblin.
[50:16.49]Video too quiet?
[50:18.75]Yeah, I'm trying to adjust it while I talk.
[50:20.10]The Tooth Goblin's gone.
[50:20.88]Mystery Man eliminates it.
[50:22.16]He better not fucking win.
[50:25.08]Less than 60 seconds if we go to the next floor.
[50:27.58]The Air Serpent now seems to be in a little bit of a problem here.
[50:34.26]He's getting his chest pushed.
[50:36.58]He's getting his stomach smelled by Dr. Roker.
[50:42.46]Wait, doesn't a serpent win this shit?
[50:44.60]Did I let that happen like four years ago?
[50:45.74]Oh, man.
[50:46.28]What the fuck was I thinking?
[50:47.74]Oh, Frogman!
[51:12.96]Here we go!
[51:13.82]Let's go!
[51:17.64]The Sims 4 murder house.
[51:31.16]We could get a few here.
[51:32.32]We could get a few bingo cards here.
[51:37.44]Get over here.
[51:38.58]You tripped it.
[51:39.30]I'm gonna find you.
[51:40.34]There you are.
[51:41.28]I'm the local resident fucking murderer.
[51:43.24]Alright, here we go.
[51:45.12]If we could get like three or four of these here, we really could.
[51:48.30]Why'd I stop?
[51:51.22]This is three hours and twenty minutes into what, the second stream maybe?
[51:56.60]Her head is just a swivel.
[52:00.14]Man, I'll tell her a joke.
[52:03.55]I smell so bad.
[52:06.09]So many nerves.
[52:07.01]At this point, was there violence involved in this one?
[52:10.09]Well, that was a lot of fun.
[52:11.47]Disabled, disabled reactions, disabled cops.
[52:19.70]Wait, this might be the tail end.
[52:21.62]Modern filmmakers in crime.
[52:22.64]It's possible this is the tail end.
[52:24.12]Exclude this from getting reaped.
[52:26.46]Exclude this from getting killed.
[52:29.05]enable drain all blood interaction for the sim okay what the hell does that mean look at all these urns I gotta get out of here rage did I say it did I say I gotta get out of here I gotta go did I I don't no I didn't did I I did no I didn't say it
[52:58.13]No, did I?
[52:59.47]You said, I gotta get out of here.
[53:00.87]Oh, goddammit.
[53:02.61]Really?
[53:03.33]No, he doesn't care.
[53:06.19]Clear up reputation on social media.
[53:20.90]Somebody's gonna walk by and throw me a dollar, right?
[53:26.82]Come on, you know you like this, dude.
[53:30.91]Don't start laughing.
[53:32.93]Don't start laughing.
[53:40.45]He fucking ran away.
[53:43.14]No.
[53:44.60]He wanted nothing to do with it.
[53:45.68]That is not a laughing fit.
[53:46.84]That is a chuckle.
[53:47.96]That is a slight chuckle.
[53:49.50]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[53:51.66]I think he was just a little nervous at first.
[53:58.64]No.
[53:59.62]No, he's gone.
[54:00.72]Okay.
[54:02.68]Practice singing.
[54:04.70]What about rage?
[54:05.60]What does rage mean?
[54:07.16]What about we don't have the yesterday stream?
[54:09.15]No, we don't have that today.
[54:10.39]Is that freaking out and smashing shit?
[54:15.49]What?
[54:20.58]Here he comes.
[54:22.08]Oh, fuck.
[54:22.62]He's coming over here.
[54:23.54]Wait, doesn't, like, death shoot somebody with a gun?
[54:26.84]No, somebody shoots death with a gun.
[54:29.48]Where's, like, the drink all blood?
[54:31.97]Wait, when does that happen?
[54:33.17]Alright, I'm gonna drink all this lady's blood.
[54:36.25]Let's see what happens.
[54:38.65]Deadly.
[54:39.95]Slice with machete.
[54:41.39]Bash head.
[54:41.99]No.
[54:42.43]I don't think I've seen any of this yet at this point of the stream.
[54:44.82]Non-deadly.
[54:46.00]See, I'm like, oh, non-deadly.
[54:47.00]What's this do?
[54:47.50]What's that?
[54:50.56]Where the hell is it?
[54:53.54]Holy shit, Eric.
[54:54.48]She's fucked up.
[54:56.57]I didn't enable it?
[54:57.19]I thought I did.
[54:59.37]Everyone else is already dead?
[55:04.65]Wait, hold on.
[55:05.33]Everybody at this point is already dead.
[55:07.72]More choices.
[55:08.42]Enable drain all blood.
[55:09.94]Okay.
[55:10.04]Okay.
[55:16.52]So we're catching like the cool down.
[55:18.88]We're catching the cool off period.
[55:26.96]You need to be a vampire.
[55:28.90]Oh.
[55:30.38]I'm like asking chat.
[55:31.88]Hey, so how do I fucking be a vampire?
[55:33.92]I guess I've killed everybody.
[55:35.42]It's time to end this.
[55:46.35]Right in the face.
[55:51.24]I was going to try to practice singing.
[55:55.08]Come on, practice singing.
[55:58.44]It is the tail end.
[56:00.28]This is where I got sick of doing this for so long.
[56:03.20]It was like, oh, I killed everybody.
[56:05.25]I ran people over with cars and I shot five people.
[56:08.19]I guess I'm bored.
[56:09.09]I guess I'll just stab the character in the stomach now.
[56:21.92]What am I doing?
[56:22.64]Are we going on an adventure?
[56:25.98]There's nobody left!
[56:26.76]What the fuck am I talking about?
[56:27.78]Buy a retail store?
[56:29.24]I thought I was gonna get my head ran over.
[56:35.08]It's time for gardening.
[56:38.88]Club Gatherers can only be held at venues and residences owned by Garden Gnomes members.
[56:45.16]I don't think I'm sleeping.
[56:46.02]Now you know how we feel most streams.
[56:47.56]Beth has a cue.
[56:49.36]This is how you guys feel a lot of time, huh?
[56:51.72]I'm sitting there going, what the fuck is he doing right now?
[56:54.46]I'm like, what the fuck?
[56:55.28]I'm sitting here going, what is he doing?
[56:57.91]Why is he doing this right now?
[57:01.37]Now I get it.
[57:03.99]I am retroactively annoyed with the way that I am playing the game.
[57:07.19]Fast forward.
[57:08.57]I'm just like, come on, dude.
[57:09.71]Let's fucking hurry up.
[57:10.85]It's going to take a long time.
[57:11.93]He's got five people.
[57:12.90]He's got something done, for God's sake.
[57:16.34]No, I get it.
[57:18.52]What's with the Xbox?
[57:20.56]Oh, that's the alien.
[57:23.01]Still bleeding out.
[57:23.97]No, he's still... See?
[57:25.53]Is there like an eye misinterpreted something?
[57:27.41]I can't believe it.
[57:27.91]Then I'm dead.
[57:31.75]No.
[57:32.61]No Nightwing shirt.
[57:33.49]No.
[57:37.19]Not a bad analogy.
[57:39.15]I tried to get a picture.
[57:39.89]I couldn't get it.
[57:40.37]Game over.
[57:43.67]Or is it, the last Sim in this household has died, but you can create more Sims, choosing the existing household to play.
[57:50.44]No, don't save in Managed World.
[57:51.86]Exit to main menu.
[58:01.03]You got a game over in the Sims.
[58:02.43]Okay, Managed World.
[58:04.17]Hey, look at this new stuff.
[58:07.43]So we need a... 10 seconds.
[58:09.47]Family to move in.
[58:10.85]You ready?
[58:12.41]I'm ready.
[58:14.16]I need a household.
[58:19.65]Where are we going?
[58:22.67]Cry of Fear co-op highlights.
[58:24.73]It was...
[59:01.48]If I replay the video, I might... If I replay the video, I might break the algorithm that's running this whole thing.
[59:17.43]If I might break it... I'm gonna break the algorithm!
[59:31.37]Alright, we're good!
[59:38.29]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[59:39.81]Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[59:42.95]This time on Scare Saturdays, gonna be going through some of the co-op of Cry of Fear with Star.
[59:48.96]Now, before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full Let's Play of Cry of Fear.
[59:57.06]As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel.
[60:05.31]But it's about a 15 minute video, condensed kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of the happenings we came across.
[60:13.17]And that's probably what you're going to get.
[60:15.13]Like I said, I don't want to have a huge let's play on this channel.
[60:17.67]It's like, you know, 50 episodes long.
[60:19.80]I've gone down that path before.
[60:21.46]As a lot of you guys know, I've done some let's plays.
[60:24.28]And yeah, we're on episode six.
[60:26.16]I'm done.
[60:27.10]But with that said, here is the video, guys.
[60:29.86]Not going to take up any more time.
[60:31.09]I want to get to the content, obviously.
[60:32.71]So it's been sunny out.
[60:34.83]Go outside and go get some sunbathing because I'm about to do it right now, baby.
[60:38.23]Sunbathing.

[61:13.54]You do it.
[61:16.10]I have to change my sensitivity.
[61:17.48]I can't aim like this.
[61:18.34]This video is almost seven years old.
[61:19.52]I'll cover you.
[61:20.04]If I die, this is all on you.
[61:21.06]I will cover you.
[61:29.30]Are you ready now for real?
[61:30.16]By the way, members of- If you were part of the pre-stream chat, Hey dude, star, do like a star appearance, or like an italics appearance.
[61:37.32]I have a gun too, but- This is insanely rare.
[61:40.91]Number one, this is a YouTube video.
[61:43.03]YouTube fucking video, which is 3.4% chance.
[61:48.07]And a star inclusion.
[61:50.61]Which is like an extra like 0.2% chance.
[61:52.73]Okay, I do see it.
[61:56.74]What is her- Is it dead?
[62:01.04]I don't have any bullets left, by the way.
[62:02.98]Yeah, that's kind of happening.
[62:04.04]We should... I think in our inventory we have a nightstick.
[62:08.88]I don't know how to equip these into slots.
[62:10.74]Stars in 30% of your videos.
[62:12.44]Yeah, but we have to hit a video and it has to be a star video.
[62:18.33]So it's 3.4% chance to have a video even play.
[62:22.03]And then 30%.
[62:22.99]What's 30% of 3.4%?
[62:25.31]Something's going to jump up.
[62:26.43]Wait, did I just get bullets?
[62:28.44]I did, didn't I?
[62:29.38]No, I didn't.
[62:29.84]That was you reloading, I think.
[62:31.63]Like 1.2?
[62:32.99]1.1?
[62:33.01]1.25?
[62:33.39]Dammit!
[62:33.67]This is fucking rare!
[62:40.11]Get out of here.
[62:41.17]What?
[62:45.54]That was... Game over?
[62:50.76]Game over.
[62:51.40]I'm so scared.
[62:57.18]Good idea.
[62:57.68]Okay.
[63:00.36]I heard somebody... Did I throw a brick at you?
[63:04.29]I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick.
[63:08.43]Is there an invisible person?
[63:10.17]I don't think I can take another two minutes of this.
[63:11.65]Where is he?
[63:12.17]Oh, he's right there.
[63:12.91]Okay.
[63:15.13]I have two more videos for the rest of the night.
[63:16.73]Get out of here.
[63:17.75]Go back to Ikea.
[63:21.48]Who thought this was scary?
[63:22.98]Go back to Jordan's Furniture, you piece of crap.
[63:26.54]That was kind of fun.
[63:28.84]The upside down flying mattress man.
[63:31.20]That was pretty fun.
[63:31.82]There's more of them!
[63:32.34]What do you mean there's more of them?
[63:33.52]Where are they?
[63:38.04]Oh my god, they're like a flock of crows.
[63:41.73]It's actually a murder of crows.
[63:43.35]I remember that comment in the YouTube comments.
[63:46.69]It's a murder of crows, you idiot.
[63:48.45]You guys haven't changed in 10 years.
[63:49.31]That one's not dead.
[63:51.87]He's still sitting there all mattress-y.
[63:55.38]Something else, something else, something else.
[63:56.44]I heard it.
[63:58.02]I'm going to Billy Club him.
[63:59.00]I don't want to... By the way... Don't waste ammo.
[64:00.60]Don't waste ammo.
[64:01.44]Oh, what's that?
[64:02.22]Ten years have almost gone by?
[64:03.78]Yeah, but he might... That guy might be a pain in the ass later.
[64:08.44]Okay, but we got to go in this way, so... I think there's somebody... Yeah, there's a person in this house as well.
[64:13.38]There's somebody in that house.
[64:14.65]Ten fucking years.
[64:15.35]I see its head.
[64:16.99]Yet?
[64:17.77]We could be brothers.
[64:18.53]Oh, my God.
[64:19.21]Oh, my God.
[64:21.01]Oh, my God.
[64:22.91]Is she dead?
[64:23.75]That was my girlfriend, Jerma.
[64:26.41]What the hell is that?
[64:27.21]What is that thing from, like, The Island of Dr. Moreau?
[64:30.35]No, that's from XCOM.
[64:31.54]We made a lot of references back in the day.
[64:32.62]How many different names of, like, enemies are they going to throw at us?
[64:34.96]No, that's the thing from The Island of Dr. Moreau.
[64:37.88]Moreau, not Munro.
[64:39.20]The thing with... Who's the fat actor?
[64:41.24]I'm scared.
[64:41.98]I can't, like, think.
[64:42.70]What do you mean, don't know who the fat actor is?
[64:46.79]You don't know who... What's this box over here?
[64:49.35]That's not a bad analogy.
[64:50.49]That's pretty good.
[64:51.91]Pageant Boy...
[64:54.36]Can we just jump in the car?
[64:55.22]We're moving.
[64:56.46]Nope, that'd be too easy.
[64:57.88]We got tuber voices been checked off.
[65:00.05]Door won't budge.
[65:01.69]None of these doors.
[65:05.81]This is tier list.
[65:10.09]All right, guys.
[65:11.38]I think that's going to be it.
[65:13.00]Wait.
[65:13.78]I'm sorry we had so many problems today.
[65:18.58]It was really bad today.
[65:23.04]And it wasn't even bad in the sense of... It wasn't even dropping frames.
[65:29.34]It was just dropping everything.
[65:31.62]The whole thing would just turn off.
[65:33.68]That sucks.
[65:37.06]So, sorry about that.
[65:38.67]I think that's like four or five VODs.
[65:45.62]not much I can do I knew they were doing maintenance they were doing something they were up they were upgrading oh god this is gonna get close man the node or something this is gonna get right on time give me a break either something up or maybe it's one of those scenarios where they're still working on it because it was the internet the internet here was turned off for like eight hours or so six hours or so I think uh yes what's wrong with this list you got a problem with this list
[66:14.03]so why is gamecube and beat here because I I don't know so high because for the longest time that I'm talking more than 15 to 20 years okay I've been searching and hoping for an entertainment device that you can use in the bathroom for my and take a shit when you go to the bathroom for 40 minutes he's so right
[66:42.63]I used to bring my computer into the bathroom and plug it in and like set up a desk in the bathroom and sit there.
[66:47.35]He's so right.
[66:48.55]God, imagine being this correct about something.
[66:54.66]Why is the switch so high?
[66:55.76]Give me a break.
[66:56.16]I used to- it was bad.
[66:57.30]I used to sit- I used to bring my computer into the bathroom.
[67:03.78]Set it up on like a stand up pop up table.
[67:08.26]And then plug everything in and sit on the toilet.
[67:11.39]Now, shit joke is not on here, guys.
[67:12.69]For a long, long fucking time.
[67:14.25]And even after I was done, I didn't... Because what a pain in the ass that was to get it all in there.
[67:20.71]So... My legs... My legs would start to tingle.
[67:26.87]I would sit there for an extra, like, 25 minutes.
[67:29.63]And I would have to, like... I would be getting, like, tingly legs.
[67:32.60]This is true.
[67:34.68]This is real.
[67:35.22]This is not a joke.
[67:35.84]Because I was sitting there for too long.
[67:38.00]And that's what maybe had to get up.
[67:44.43]This is not a lie.
[67:46.91]This is actually real life for me when I was like 14, 15, 16.
[67:49.75]I think I remember my mother at the time fighting this and eventually just being like,
[67:57.27]vaude germa is funnier than live germa vaude germa is germa if you're gonna do it this is me talking this is like four months ago that's me that's me talking to you bring why are you doing all that why are you bringing all that stuff into the bathroom it's like uh because I wanted I just I'm like working I I don't know I was an idiot no no I'm gonna turn off I'm gonna turn off listen to me
[68:21.27]Before I go, before I turn off, I want to do the bits, but it's going to be fucked up.
[68:24.46]Hold on.
[68:25.32]All right.
[68:25.86]Long story short, I can bring the switch into the bathroom and I can shit on it and keep my hands close and not have to worry about my legs tingling so I can get up whenever I want and put it over.
[68:37.69]Okay, done.
[68:38.45]It's for real.
[68:39.19]My internet's going to turn off.
[68:40.33]So let's try to get some of these bits done before we get shut off.
[68:46.53]Done.
[68:46.73]Done.
[68:50.83]Let's get... No, not BRB.
[68:55.53]I will see you guys later.
[68:56.23]The next time you're going to see me... Stream's not actually up.
[68:58.11]It's just like we're watching something on a certain... That's not a BRB.
[69:01.67]Stream.

[69:20.60]I'll be back on Sunday.
[69:23.44]It flashed.
[69:25.06]There's a couple of things I want to try to get started.
[69:28.94]I want to try to do a few things on... Alright, what are you looking for here?
[69:32.94]Remember, remember, this is for 500 communities.
[69:34.54]I want to work on that.
[69:35.02]500.
[69:35.04]A good announcement I can make next week to set that all up.
[69:43.17]If you don't know what I'm talking about, does it not count?
[69:44.93]You'll know very soon.
[69:46.25]It was accidental.
[69:46.99]I also am obviously going to work on the other stream too.
[69:50.83]So I will see you guys on Sunday.
[69:52.91]No, this is not, this is fake.
[69:56.51]But for now, let me see, let me try to get through these bits before the internet turns off.
[69:59.79]And if it does, I'm sorry if I miss your bits or your subs.
[70:02.47]Remember, not real.
[70:04.19]It's kind of out of my control at this point, but I'm going to try.
[70:06.95]Doesn't count.
[70:07.55]I'm going to rapid fire these.
[70:10.67]Which usually means I'm going to do it much slower than normal.
[70:14.37]All right, press 1 if it counts, 2 if it doesn't count right now.
[70:16.99]I hope not.
[70:17.55]Let me actually hold on.
[70:24.45]Oh, this is tough.
[70:25.09]But thank you for joining me.
[70:25.81]It was a lot of fun.
[70:26.43]Doesn't count?
[70:28.34]Kind of a long one.
[70:30.26]Playing with Star was a lot of fun.
[70:31.98]Star again?
[70:32.20]Jesus Christ.
[70:32.50]Doesn't count?
[70:39.30]I've done come done come But the majority is spoken done.
[70:43.89]We're out raid Vinny doubt already after this great Vinny after this by the way We're gonna raid Vinny.
[70:49.95]All right, so let's go 14 seconds.
[70:51.17]Let's go Today when it's just I want to see where this cuts off because I the stream turned on and turned off like five times Let me make sure this is human back in October November of last year.

[71:15.27]Another one.
[71:16.69]Cheese nip.
[71:17.77]Let's see.
[71:20.03]We'll let the people decide.
[71:21.83]Wait, I'm doing a vote for cheese it or cheese nip?
[71:25.29]Put a filter on your voice so we can determine who's talking.
[71:29.23]I hope they come up with, like, a Charlie Cheese November.
[71:31.13]Oh, you tripped it.
[71:31.73]Let's go.
[71:33.15]Here comes the poll.
[71:33.67]All right, I'll put a filter on so you know who's talking.
[71:35.81]Please vote on this poll if you'd like.
[71:38.03]Okay.
[71:39.01]The lower one is me.
[71:40.24]The lower one is me.
[71:41.38]The one that lies low is me.
[71:46.72]And introducing first.
[71:48.88]He doesn't need an introduction.
[71:51.59]Captain Chee.
[71:53.47]He's currently wearing the best cheese-flavored snack belt.
[71:58.51]That is a real belt.
[72:00.33]He is the champion of all cheese snacks.
[72:02.59]Captain Cheese is my champion.
[72:07.02]No!
[72:07.56]No!
[72:08.12]Captain Cheese.
[72:11.30]And don't worry.
[72:13.32]Don't worry.
[72:13.74]Ladies and gentlemen, it's not like Jerma gave Captain Cheese it like 99 in all stats and Captain Cheese nipped like 30.
[72:20.95]There's no reverb.
[72:22.73]He deserves it.
[72:23.73]Where's the echo?
[72:25.89]Cheese nips are fucking gross.
[72:29.34]And you also be ashamed if you think cheese nips are better than cheeses.
[72:35.62]There's no echo.
[72:38.08]And introducing next his opponent.
[72:40.50]His opponent coming into the ring right now.
[72:42.13]A disgusting human being.
[72:46.23]Trying to kill the American people, by the way.
[72:48.13]Turn off the lights.
[72:48.77]Here they go.
[72:50.53]Why is there so much reverb?
[72:53.13]What's happening?
[72:53.84]What the fuck is happening?
[72:56.69]I'm not, I don't understand.
[72:57.95]What's he holding in his hand?
[72:59.57]What is that?
[73:00.69]I know what that is.
[73:02.58]I know what that is.
[73:04.00]That's the third ingredient in cheese nips.
[73:06.10]It's poison!
[73:07.50]I knew it!
[73:08.12]I probably shouldn't have said that, by the way.
[73:09.62]He's poisoning his body.
[73:10.90]He's getting his ingredients all ready to go.
[73:13.72]I should never have said this.
[73:14.98]This is like bad.
[73:15.53]He's fucking poisoning himself.
[73:17.41]Just like all the cheese nips.
[73:18.71]Disgusting.
[73:21.58]Is this a joke?
[73:22.28]Like, I just want to make sure this is a joke.
[73:24.38]Charlie Chee.
[73:25.28]At Cheese Niffs.
[73:26.12]That's not an ad.
[73:26.80]That's me, like, talking about how much this thing sucks.
[73:29.76]That's not an ad.
[73:30.46]I don't really want to even be in the arena right now.
[73:36.90]Lawsuit incoming.
[73:39.74]There it is.
[73:41.12]Okay, let's get that off the screen.
[73:44.52]Hey, by the way, this is like this slander campaign brought to you by...
[73:50.66]Is it still there?
[73:51.18]Is it still there?
[73:51.78]Ring that bell.
[73:52.34]This is an extreme rules.
[73:53.26]Who has the best cheese flavored snack?
[73:54.90]Charlie Cheese Nips.
[73:56.51]Right off the bat with a scoop slam on.
[73:57.91]Captain, this is going to be fucking hard to remember these names.
[74:00.45]This should not be even heard.
[74:03.65]I'm gonna call him Cheese Nip and Cheese It.
[74:05.01]Alright this is weird.
[74:05.45]Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
[74:16.04]What the fuck?
[74:18.04]There we go. Alright we're good.
[74:20.82]Now you know who's the Jerma. You know, the regular one.
[74:26.72]My favorite snack is Cheez-Its, especially the Tabasco ones, and they're fucking unbelievably delicious.
[74:31.90]You should buy as much as you can possibly fit in your house.
[74:36.19]You got a spare bedroom?
[74:37.59]Fill it with Cheez-It Box.
[74:38.41]How's that?
[74:38.71]This should be better.
[74:39.45]You got a bathroom you don't use very much?
[74:40.81]I'm a little bit lower.
[74:41.47]There you go.
[74:42.29]So now you can tell who the real... Buy another Cheez-It Box.
[74:45.73]Put it in the Cheez-It Box.
[74:46.52]There you go.
[74:48.06]This is a real voice turmoil.
[74:49.64]No, he almost slipped there for a second.
[74:51.42]Cheez-Its can be a little greasy.
[74:53.34]They can be a little greasy.
[74:54.58]Cheese nips aren't as greasy, I will agree.
[74:56.32]And a giant... Wait a minute!
[74:58.46]He gets caught by Mr. Cheese Nose and throws him down to the ground.
[75:02.74]Now he's going to go on the top rope.
[75:04.77]Second rope.
[75:05.89]We all know if you go on the second rope, you're a fucking wuss.
[75:08.71]And that's what he's doing.
[75:09.68]Exactly what he's doing.
[75:10.36]You go on the second rope, you're a wuss.
[75:12.10]Wow.
[75:12.64]Why does it sound so fucked up?
[75:14.10]That was fucking lame.
[75:17.00]It's all right, though.
[75:18.20]Is that how this is?
[75:19.12]Is it going to be able to get up?
[75:20.28]Okay.
[75:21.11]Why does it sound so fucked up?
[75:24.58]The yellow guy just did a elbow drop on the orange guy.
[75:29.07]Orange guy got him.
[75:29.75]Orange guy got him by the back.
[75:31.05]Drops him into the nose.
[75:32.41]This big fucking ugly cheez-it nose.
[75:34.83]Cheese nips nose.
[75:37.06]Nice miss, by the way, orange guy.
[75:38.62]How about that?
[75:40.98]Oh, he gets reversed there.
[75:42.18]These are extreme rules.
[75:42.96]Go get something.
[75:43.70]Thank you.
[75:45.13]God, I'm talking all this shit and he's going underneath the ring finally for the first time.
[75:49.66]Is that better?
[75:50.46]No.
[75:50.80]Even if it sounds weird.
[75:51.30]He picked up a... He picked up a kendo stick.
[75:55.82]And he's currently... No, that's a cheese stick.
[75:58.08]What am I talking about?
[75:58.73]He picked up a giant cheese stick.
[76:00.43]But he gets reversed.
[76:01.87]Remember, these are all cheese-based rules.
[76:04.79]That is a sharp cheddar cheese stick.
[76:06.35]Just turn it off.
[76:07.77]Gets reversed.
[76:08.39]Now he's gonna get thrown over it.
[76:10.07]Go up the steps.
[76:10.99]Well, here we go.
[76:11.60]We got 25 seconds left.
[76:12.68]He just hit his head on the side.
[76:15.77]I'm trying to differentiate the voices to make it so you can tell who's talking.
[76:19.65]Get him on the table!
[76:20.83]Get him on the table!
[76:21.61]How about this?
[76:22.29]What are you doing?
[76:22.79]Is this better?
[76:23.68]Everybody stood up.
[76:24.54]It was perfect.
[76:25.26]Holy shit.
[76:27.64]Captain Cheez-It is now on the top ropes all the way to the outside.
[76:30.66]Here comes a... No!
[76:35.05]No!
[76:37.17]Let's go!
[76:40.57]He just got a double kill.
[76:42.27]Oblivion.
[76:42.59]Now this guy's dead.
[76:46.15]Why are you doing this to me, game?
[76:48.41]Stop it.
[76:50.05]Oh, I gotta turn.
[76:50.77]I just can't.
[76:51.81]Something I never fucking finished.
[76:54.95]Didn't even try.
[76:55.65]That's a glitch.
[76:58.09]I'm just julienning fucking french fries.
[77:01.92]That's a glitch.
[77:03.22]Okay.
[77:04.34]Let's put it on there.
[77:09.06]What are we getting close to?
[77:13.46]That's not a terrible analogy.
[77:14.72]That's a good one.
[77:17.70]Julianning french fries, that's fucking smart and funny and interesting and hilarious.
[77:23.98]Finally.
[77:29.32]Alright, mouth music.
[77:30.68]No music, no terrible aim.
[77:32.41]I can't have this happen.
[77:34.55]Actually hurting people.
[77:35.89]No fall jokes.
[77:37.29]Hope not.
[77:38.47]Stop it.
[77:42.55]Yeah, this is a glitch.
[77:43.37]This is all fucked up.
[77:44.19]Doesn't help.
[77:45.77]Yeah, it belongs on here.
[77:47.69]You're right.
[77:48.23]Hey, stop that.
[77:54.45]This is wicked fucked up.
[77:58.67]No, te- Why do we have to- Why does it have to be at this part?
[78:03.28]No, technical difficulties is something wrong with the stream or a-
[78:11.51]This is not ignoring the game's story.
[78:14.16]This is me fight- What?
[78:16.30]I'm fighting like in a fucking dungeon.
[78:19.38]No, I can't.
[78:20.12]I'll throw up.
[78:20.98]I'm seriously gonna fucking get sick if I do that.
[78:24.81]Is that a technique?
[78:26.07]I mean, it kind of- No, it's not.
[78:27.11]That's me doing that intentional.
[78:29.95]It's a shitty joke.
[78:30.85]It's not technical difficulties.
[78:32.90]I wish I could compare.
[78:37.69]I think these are better than what I have on.
[78:39.34]Guard helmet I think is a little bit better.
[78:40.76]Let's see.
[78:45.48]JML Greaves.
[78:47.64]Yeah.
[78:48.66]No, they're not.
[78:50.12]Iron Greaves.
[78:52.53]Guard helmet's one.
[78:53.49]I think the other one's one as well.
[78:57.67]I forgot that's what he looked like.
[78:59.01]I did a face cam fucking yesterday.
[79:11.98]How close are we?
[79:12.88]I gotta take a look at this.
[79:17.68]You can't do 720.
[79:18.22]I think 360 might be the max.
[79:26.09]Don't make any impressions.
[79:28.01]Yeah.
[79:28.45]Remember, we can go down here, too.
[79:30.41]No Nightwing shirt.
[79:31.39]No.
[79:31.49]I don't think we're going to see the Star Wars shirt.
[79:37.67]Breaking a game is not on the list.
[79:39.89]360 FOV.
[79:40.61]There it is.
[79:42.60]Now, if you're wondering why, you're probably curious as to saying, Hey, Germo, why have you not finished Oblivion?
[79:50.17]Why wouldn't you go back to play Oblivion?
[79:53.31]Because I did all this shit, and then the game became not interesting anymore.
[79:58.18]No.
[79:59.08]FOV 10.
[80:00.44]This is just magnifying glass.
[80:07.48]You ignored the story.
[80:09.68]No, I did, but not right now.
[80:13.43]Guys, Oblivion's like a 450 hour long game.
[80:17.23]This is not a story.
[80:18.76]This is not me ignoring the story.
[80:20.46]This is me, like, doing one of the quests.
[80:24.36]Don't die in here.
[80:28.50]Why would I?
[80:28.90]It turns down.
[80:32.03]It's a side quest.
[80:32.87]Nothing else in here.
[80:34.01]Plates.
[80:35.25]Sleeping quarters.
[80:36.31]I'm so glad I haven't mentioned eating or ass or pissing.
[80:39.39]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[80:40.25]Hold on.
[80:40.89]Hey, wait a minute.
[80:41.97]Nothing up here at all.
[80:47.35]You realize that all your life you've been coasting along as if you were in a dream, suddenly facing the trials of last few days, you've come alive.
[80:54.02]Is that, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[80:56.54]Wait, is that strange noise or is that music?
[81:00.10]Is that, that's music?
[81:01.94]No, it's not.
[81:02.80]I mean, it is, it's fucking music.
[81:08.47]Athletic strength.
[81:11.17]That's a, no, that's a strange noise.
[81:17.08]How much fatigue you have... That's not me going like... That's like... That's a weird noise.
[81:23.86]Yeah.
[81:28.72]Don't get mad at that.
[81:30.62]Basket case.
[81:32.16]I said level up.
[81:35.27]Well, let's get going.
[81:36.25]I'm like getting it on my phone.
[81:38.17]I've just grabbed... I failed the tutorial.
[81:41.69]He's going...
[81:47.15]Are they biting people?
[81:51.89]Why would you run towards the animal?
[81:54.13]Alright, I get it.
[81:54.77]I understand the gist of the game.
[81:55.81]Is there a rewind?
[81:56.71]Is there a rewind button?
[82:02.88]That's not a laughing fit.
[82:06.30]Is this how giraffes sleep?
[82:09.32]That's fucking crazy!
[82:12.96]What?
[82:15.10]Don't you get a stiff neck?
[82:20.45]Okay, alright, I get it, I get it.
[82:21.73]I understand how this works.
[82:22.47]That's not a laughing fit!
[82:27.65]That was not a laughing fit.
[82:30.01]That was not a laughing fit.
[82:31.21]How do I pick you up?
[82:32.03]That was not a- A fit is like where I can't stop.
[82:34.81]Emergency capture.
[82:38.19]Oh shit!
[82:38.83]How do you- Too much, too many bits!
[82:40.71]This is disabled by the tutorial.
[82:44.51]No, laughing fit is like I can't even like talk or breathe, it's all you hear for like ten straight seconds.
[82:52.63]So how do I get them back?
[82:58.53]Where are they?
[83:01.97]There's a lot of potential for... Look, I didn't mean to delete this.
[83:04.51]I'm trying to delete plants because it's like... They don't like the shrubs in there.
[83:08.25]Get rid of them.
[83:08.77]They hate it.
[83:10.34]Was it the Sims?
[83:12.02]When you have a painting in the room that the Sim doesn't like, the fun goes to zero?
[83:21.51]There's an undo at the bottom.
[83:22.63]We already have a bad, a bad, that's not an impression of who.
[83:28.88]Impression of who?
[83:31.54]Of what are you talking about?
[83:32.46]How do I get the animals back in?
[83:39.70]Alright, I gotta pee.
[83:41.10]I'll be right back.
[83:42.82]I'll be right back.
[83:43.68]No, no, where are you going?
[83:44.48]Where are you going?
[83:45.06]How do I get these animals back in here?
[83:48.26]He's just walking around.
[84:01.78]Alright, how do I delete this part?
[84:03.28]Here, come here.
[84:13.34]Just let him walk around?
[84:15.02]Let them roam.
[84:15.72]No, I need to do the second tutorial.
[84:19.90]Okay, let's do this.
[84:20.86]Come here.
[84:22.10]This is temporary.
[84:23.00]I didn't want to fuck this whole thing up, but I have to.
[84:33.49]Get rid of this shit.
[84:34.31]How do I delete this road?
[84:37.60]Call the keeper?
[84:38.76]I can't... Can I not even... I don't think I can do that.
[84:43.14]Call vet.
[84:44.30]Because, look, I can't... I can't, like, emergency capture.
[84:48.67]Is vet gonna go over here?
[84:49.69]What about this?
[84:50.15]Call the vet.
[84:56.75]They'll walk back in when I'm hungry.
[85:01.58]He's going to the bathroom.
[85:06.32]They're all trying to leave.
[85:09.02]There's a line.
[85:10.31]There's a line out the door to leave.
[85:13.87]He can't even escape.
[85:16.33]What the hell was that?
[85:22.63]What, you got a sniper rifle?
[85:38.03]I didn't want it to go to like to shit You can just step over this he can step over this it's a baby game.
[85:52.68]Are you serious?
[85:54.42]Oh?
[86:04.67]Alright, what did I miss?
[86:05.45]What did I miss?
[86:06.71]What did I miss?
[86:07.79]What did I miss?
[86:08.53]Did I miss anything?
[86:09.95]The vet's on duty.
[86:12.25]What did I miss?
[86:12.77]What habitat's invalid?
[86:13.85]What's wrong with this?
[86:17.24]Wait, where are you going?
[86:21.88]Laughing fit?
[86:23.78]Wait, is this the part with the gorilla?
[86:25.20]This is the gorilla part.
[86:29.32]Did I buy something?
[86:32.87]No, no.
[86:33.41]Chat's lying.
[86:33.77]Okay.
[86:34.27]Okay.
[86:34.47]All right.
[86:35.79]Yeah, I see.
[86:36.29]I see.
[86:36.51]That's a chain link fence.
[86:46.64]How about a brick wall?
[86:51.34]All right.
[86:55.66]Are we still good?
[86:57.74]Watch the clip.
[86:58.32]It's funny.
[87:01.61]I can't!
[87:02.43]How did it become invalid?
[87:05.77]I can't watch your clip and watch it!
[87:07.23]I gotta pay attention to the video!
[87:08.74]How did I fuck this up?
[87:09.52]I don't understand.
[87:10.08]What's wrong with this?
[87:12.38]You have 158 seconds.
[87:13.04]Hold on.
[87:13.22]Where is it?
[87:13.70]I have to...
[87:32.62]Alright, what is wrong with this gate?
[87:37.33]Marked as not a... No, no, where are you going?
[87:40.27]Where are you going?
[87:46.12]Where?
[87:46.26]How did I screw it up?
[87:50.44]That's pretty funny.
[87:51.52]This part here, that's a problem?
[87:55.86]Oh my god, Jerma, fucking just go!
[87:58.00]Do something!
[87:58.75]The fence was fucked up, though.
[88:00.51]How did I fuck up the tutorial?
[88:02.17]Well, it's very easy because I was selecting- I was selecting the bushes over here, and it was selecting this fucking building, and I deleted the building when I was selecting the bushes here.
[88:12.52]I did it like ten times.
[88:14.28]You sure you don't want to pick up this building and delete it?
[88:16.10]I mean, look, I'm moving on to the next tutorial.
[88:20.30]Moulding should have been a free space.
[88:21.35]I know what I'm doing.
[88:22.43]Seriously.
[88:22.81]I don't know why it's over here.
[88:25.13]It should have been a free space.
[88:26.23]I softlocked myself, somebody said.
[88:28.41]Why were they selecting the bushes?
[88:29.55]Because they don't look!
[88:31.22]That's not a bad aim!
[88:32.18]They don't like bushes!
[88:33.72]They fucking hate them!
[88:36.86]And it was like, there's something wrong with their habitat!
[88:38.82]They don't like the bushes!
[88:41.38]No, get 60 seconds!
[88:43.62]Look, see?
[88:45.26]Well, you know, they really, really don't like those trees.
[88:48.95]They don't like the bushes either.
[88:50.27]Oh, I think I feel an Alex Jones coming on.
[88:53.75]Is he gonna do it?
[88:55.03]So I have to go through and get rid of these or they're gonna hate their environment.
[89:02.32]Oh, that was close.
[89:03.00]I know how to play.
[89:03.72]I'm done.
[89:05.14]We're gonna play.
[89:09.24]That shit was real close.
[89:09.82]All these plants need to be deleted.
[89:16.69]He has to mention Joe Rogan for it to be an Alex Jones impression.
[89:23.49]Wait, what?
[89:25.45]That's so true.
[89:27.05]That is unbelievably accurate.
[89:30.32]Well, they hate everything in here.
[89:31.52]Ten seconds.
[89:35.20]Okay, we're in Richmond.
[89:36.02]We need food in here.
[89:36.79]Here we go.
[89:43.31]It's the middle guy.
[89:44.15]It's the middle one.
[89:46.97]The pursuit of justice.
[89:51.10]Yeah, here comes the straw poll.
[89:54.68]Second from the left.
[89:55.52]Alright, here comes the straw poll.
[89:56.76]Hold on.
[89:58.88]I have no idea.
[89:59.52]We're about to identify the fucking murderer.
[90:03.48]I'm just going to do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[90:12.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[90:14.45]Who is it?
[90:19.07]Give me some help here, guys.
[90:20.47]Ah, too bad I didn't have does a pull.
[90:23.31]That would have been really, really easy.
[90:24.63]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[90:28.68]If it was a pole, it would have been instant.
[90:32.16]It looks like three is winning.
[90:35.00]Oh, wow.
[90:35.38]We're almost as tall as suspect number one.
[90:37.74]Actually, guys, sorry to say this, but, like, I'm, like, up here.
[90:42.04]I'm, like, right there.
[90:43.12]You motherfuckers.
[90:43.88]I'm taller than all these guys.
[90:46.58]So, sorry.
[90:48.44]You're wrong.
[90:49.66]This is five-six.
[90:51.25]These guys are all wide.
[90:51.89]These guys are all five feet tall.
[90:53.15]Five-six to six feet right here.
[90:54.79]That's not, that's not, doesn't make any...
[90:58.66]Alright, it's the middle guy.
[91:00.88]The middle guy is winning by a huge amount.
[91:02.46]Thank you for voting.
[91:03.22]It's a close in the poll.
[91:04.70]Middle guy.
[91:06.38]By the way, why do I have to pick for her?
[91:09.61]She's the one that witnessed the crime.
[91:11.79]I was just told about it.
[91:13.57]Why do I have to pick this?
[91:16.63]That's the guy.
[91:17.85]I'm sure of it.
[91:22.28]Okay, let me scan these people.
[91:27.86]Okay, we need it.
[91:28.50]We need to go to legal that we got to build the case or do identity case constructor Identity there he is Case for identity line up.
[91:45.31]Okay.
[91:45.77]See.
[91:46.03]Yep.
[91:46.33]There he is Why would he just scan that That doesn't seem like something that needs to be scanned
[91:59.42]Level up!
[92:00.52]Wait, this is when I was still reading bits during streams?
[92:03.76]This is when I was still doing it.
[92:04.96]How old is this stream?
[92:28.81]$3.42.
[92:29.25]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[92:30.91]Thanks for the $10.26, so $3.42 three times.
[92:32.69]Thank you also, Sprite.
[92:36.19]Thank you for making me laugh and keeping me going while working on game sprites.
[92:40.40]Well, your name makes sense now, Sprite37.
[92:42.42]You have a good one as well.
[92:45.16]He skipped my bits.
[92:46.98]And also, thank you to Spriteak.
[92:49.67]Spriteak, again, for the $5.
[92:50.77]Have the rest of my tax returns.
[92:53.43]Thank you.
[92:56.23]Alright, let's go.
[92:57.33]Good old days.
[92:58.87]Alright, thank God we're getting the fuck out of here.
[93:01.43]Probably not.
[93:02.35]But you know, fucking whatever.
[93:08.22]There has to be something I can do here, but there's just absolutely nothing to do.
[93:12.14]Why does this exist?
[93:18.92]Like, there's nothing here.
[93:23.49]Let's go back to the courthouse.
[93:26.02]No, wait.
[93:26.86]Well, if you really think you're prepared enough, go ahead.
[93:28.79]This is for day three.
[93:31.51]You guys are looking for a TF2 video.
[93:33.39]Wait, I have a new message.
[93:34.71]An actual rumor issue.
[93:36.11]Click maps.
[93:36.47]Or a fall joke.
[93:44.17]Uh, yeah, yes, sir.
[93:45.45]A court reporter will be present at the time.
[93:47.71]That was a click map.
[93:48.99]Did you just shoo me away?
[93:50.21]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[93:51.21]That's the last chance here.
[93:52.59]That was literally a map click.
[93:54.25]No, no, a click map.
[93:56.11]Like the circles on the screen.
[93:58.94]No, we're not playing semantics.
[94:00.66]We're not playing semantics.
[94:03.58]You have two messages.
[94:07.49]That's not me talking, that's not an impression.
[94:11.69]Okay, thanks for the filler.
[94:35.00]Thank you for the filler.
[94:36.04]I appreciate that.
[94:36.88]Let's go to the map.
[94:37.74]Where were those?
[94:38.18]What happens after a bingo?
[94:39.48]I give 500 community subs.
[94:41.22]This is what happened.
[94:43.62]Interrogation records evidence.
[94:47.62]Let's get in here.
[94:48.90]For the trial tomorrow.
[94:53.23]Basketball.
[94:55.11]Weed eaters.
[94:57.35]What the fuck?
[95:01.13]Why are you extending this shit?
[95:02.77]Where's the evidence?
[95:05.62]Oh, there we go.
[95:06.10]Alright.
[95:07.82]Uh, we got the car.
[95:10.26]Scan that.
[95:12.76]Okay.
[95:13.30]I gotta stop talking.
[95:15.04]I'm just gonna have to scan all this shit, aren't I?
[95:16.70]Of course I am.
[95:17.37]And, like, I'm gonna have to get the fingerprints and shit.
[95:24.27]Oh, no.
[95:25.15]No time for that.
[95:26.31]Court is about to start.
[95:27.89]Court is about to- Good luck, counselor.
[95:29.27]Oh, no.
[95:30.00]Oh, God.
[95:31.58]Okay, okay.
[95:32.22]Case for identity.
[95:34.64]We got this.
[95:37.42]Okay, we got... The good old days never end.
[95:42.92]And case for murder.
[95:45.91]We have, like, killing of a human being.
[95:47.61]How do you extend with channel points?
[95:50.73]If you highlight a message, it is... Premeditated.
[95:54.15]20,000 channel points to add 30 seconds to a video.
[95:57.81]Right, by the way.
[95:59.07]And... All right.
[96:08.40]I'm not supposed to be talking.
[96:10.26]None of this is right.
[96:12.83]I'm a good talker.
[96:13.51]You get the guy on that stand and I'll be able to fucking make it happen.
[96:18.77]Here we go.
[96:22.70]I might have to use... No.
[96:24.28]I'm going to use my second veto.
[96:25.60]I'm going to use my second veto.
[96:27.02]You trip it at five minutes.
[96:36.13]I actually just got baited.
[96:37.21]I did... That was fucking horrible.
[96:38.74]There he is.
[96:39.06]There's that guilty motherfucker right there.
[96:42.42]Ladies and gentlemen, court is now in session.
[96:47.21]People may proceed with their case.
[96:49.57]It's been five minutes.
[96:50.75]Alright, where's the game glitch?
[96:52.79]Game glitch.
[96:53.75]Here's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[96:56.05]Walking around.
[96:57.13]You killed it.
[96:57.91]You killed it.
[97:08.36]You will hear in the testimony of Cindy Lee Chen how the defendant came into Hal's bar with a group of Chu Sing gang members and headed straight for Tommy Woo.
[97:17.90]You will hear how Tommy was choked with a steel cable and dragged to the floor.
[97:24.33]The defendant is charged with first-degree murder.
[97:26.89]The evidence will show he is guilty of this charge.
[97:29.65]Walking back and forth, like moving his hands around.
[97:31.49]Oh, God damn it.
[97:34.69]Should I use my second veto or the night?
[97:37.85]I can't wait to put the third disc in.
[97:49.12]I only get one more after this.
[97:52.54]Did I miss that?
[97:53.26]Did I miss the entire rat tattoo arc of the whole stream?
[97:59.09]I had to have.
[98:00.37]There was probably like a whole huge story about the rat tattoo.
[98:04.58]There's an underwater taxi.
[98:06.32]You thought he was going over the thing.
[98:16.05]Hold on, itchy nose.
[98:17.17]Not good.
[98:19.31]I gotta restart.
[98:21.57]I wonder if this is gonna get tripped.
[98:24.31]Of course it is.
[98:25.01]Alright, what's possible here?
[98:26.21]What's actually possible here?
[98:35.18]Who's in this car?
[98:37.60]Who the fuck is in this car?
[98:38.81]I mean, molding is done.
[98:50.64]Screaming is still on the table, yeah.
[98:55.66]Ambulance complete.
[98:56.54]Impressions are still on the table, that's true.
[99:01.81]Use horn.
[99:02.81]Use horn.
[99:05.32]That was a rumor here, right now.
[99:07.80]That was a rumor here, not in the past.
[99:13.02]What the hell is the lion pose?
[99:14.56]It's this thing.
[99:15.30]You guys are driving me wrong.
[99:17.66]I used to do it fucking every straight.
[99:19.26]This guy's freaking me out.
[99:21.00]Bad.
[99:21.40]Big time.
[99:25.20]Okay, drive to the hospital.
[99:27.45]None of these counts because it's... No, no, no.
[99:29.11]It has to be... No, no, no.
[99:30.03]It doesn't count.
[99:32.03]Alright, talk to Dr. Hibbert.
[99:33.57]Alright, final mission incoming.
[99:42.54]Final?
[99:43.02]Wait, this is the last mission?
[99:44.24]Um, oh yeah, Jerma, you think it's the final mission?
[99:49.74]There's six more fucking hours in this VOD.
[99:56.16]What are you talking about?
[99:57.08]You think it's the final mission?
[100:07.24]Is that... Is that a bait?
[100:11.36]Here we are at our final destination.
[100:13.50]It's just between me and you, random object.
[100:21.12]Well, I... Did I say final or did somebody in chat say final?
[100:24.53]That was a selfie.
[100:25.19]I know my face cam's not on.
[100:28.07]Why?
[100:28.71]There's no... Put down the rocks!
[100:37.69]Hello, famous American clown.
[100:39.60]I wish to ask a favor.
[100:41.04]Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[100:44.76]Oh, I was like, what the fuck are you guys doing?
[100:47.40]Chat said last level.
[100:48.64]Did they say that?
[100:50.64]We're putting them down by throwing them.
[100:56.87]Fall joke is very important to not have happen.
[100:59.73]TF2 videos fucking guaranteed to not happen.
[101:02.97]Thank you, horrible man.
[101:06.23]Need a disguise.
[101:07.01]Purchase.
[101:07.81]Whose American clothes?
[101:10.05]Another 425 coins.
[101:11.89]Click maps is possible.
[101:13.13]Shit.
[101:19.77]An impression incoming?
[101:21.53]57 coins.
[101:22.77]I mean, it's possible.
[101:24.43]It's possible.
[101:24.91]I don't know, though.
[101:25.35]Alright, we have to scrounge around now.
[101:32.50]How long am I gonna do this for?
[101:34.58]We're gonna find boxes, we're gonna find sewing machines, there's a box over here.
[101:37.40]I don't know, until I'm fucking bored.
[101:39.54]Do a wager race?
[101:44.50]We've seen how much of a disaster those were.
[101:46.33]I should sleep more.
[101:55.50]A.K.A.
[101:55.94]right before he loses.
[101:57.23]No, no, no.
[101:58.35]I'll give you a time.
[101:58.91]Okay.
[101:59.65]So, we'll do this for... Ugh.
[102:02.73]Not a bad start.
[102:04.13]At least... At least three or four hours.
[102:06.83]At least.
[102:09.66]So, if you guys... If it's like, well, you know, guys, I'm gonna feel like I'm a little sick today.
[102:15.28]Right before you get a bingo?
[102:16.24]No, no, no.
[102:17.06]It has to be at least a four-hour sprint.
[102:18.84]At least.
[102:19.10]A little box right here.
[102:25.60]And a B. That took a lot longer than it should have.
[102:35.35]It's not an impression.
[102:36.95]What do you get if you win?
[102:38.41]Um, nothing.
[102:39.97]I've already been given so much by this community.
[102:41.93]That's the fucking good answer, right?
[102:43.19]400, right?
[102:43.39]Or was it 425?
[102:50.95]But if I lose, then I'll give Twitch a percentage of the money for 500 of you to be subscribed.
[103:01.31]That's a nice PR spin.
[103:06.83]I'll just pay Twitch a bunch of money to sub 500 people.
[103:10.30]What about the statues?
[103:15.72]TheKillerSock, thanks a lot for the sub.
[103:17.40]TheKillerSock11518.
[103:20.11]Thank you for the sub.
[103:23.36]How about one of my cars?
[103:25.10]Is that person still subbed?
[103:27.16]How do we check?
[103:27.62]Well, this is too bad because we got rolled a really boring, shitty part of this stream.
[103:41.89]This is crazy.
[103:45.40]So remember, I beat this whole game in one stream.
[103:48.04]This might be the one 5-10 minute portion of this stream where I don't sound like I'm gonna fucking strangle myself.
[103:54.71]This is weird.
[103:56.23]This is like a weird downtime for this stream.
[103:59.13]Alright.
[104:04.13]It's very calm.
[104:08.50]I'm gonna hit it.
[104:09.50]Ah, that was a blocked out.
[104:15.38]I'm very calm and just relaxed.
[104:20.88]This is a slippery course.
[104:31.85]Did they block off on most of these wasted skip groups?
[104:38.20]This is so bad.
[104:39.26]I think I'm going to have to restart this.
[104:41.36]Holy shit, I suck.
[104:52.21]Yeah, this is a lost cause right now.
[105:00.39]Unless I can... I don't think I can do anything.
[105:03.14]No.
[105:04.26]Maybe I could have, like,
[105:07.33]Let's go!
[105:09.85]The offices, yeah.
[105:10.71]Resident Evil 2 remake.
[105:11.85]Which one?
[105:13.45]Up here.
[105:15.98]Oh, by the way, best game that came out last year.
[105:17.62]Well, what's even hidden up there?
[105:20.76]Because you're talking about that.
[105:21.62]That's quite, that's a journey for me to go on right now.
[105:23.82]Hold on.
[105:25.44]If I go up from here, I'm going to get myself fucking killed.
[105:33.41]We might get a scream.
[105:34.47]It's possible.
[105:35.09]This is the one point where it could happen.
[105:38.76]Drip it!
[105:39.40]There it is.
[105:42.01]You might get your scream.
[105:44.87]So I'm just gonna try, I'm gonna go up the stairs from here, and we'll go to the star's office.
[105:55.08]You got five minutes for a scream to happen here.
[105:59.92]Star's office.
[106:02.12]You opposing webcams?
[106:03.70]No, there's already a webcam on the screen, you don't need me.
[106:14.70]If you get screamed, then you're looking for a look at me, a laughing fit, or ignoring the game's whole story.
[106:23.45]Hold on a second.
[106:24.51]No, I can't go this way.
[106:25.13]I've got to go through the showers.
[106:26.09]There are lickers all over the place here.
[106:35.12]I've got to walk through here and then through the door.
[106:38.18]Yeah, you do.
[106:53.16]I know there's at least one up here.
[106:56.72]I've shot this thing like 10 times.
[107:02.67]What's that fucking?
[107:03.73]Straight, and then it's on the left.
[107:07.87]There he is.
[107:15.59]Don't.
[107:29.48]All right, so where was that?
[107:32.25]It was somebody's desk with coffee on it?
[107:35.11]Let me take a look.
[107:39.03]There's a stereo player and then a phone with some pens.
[107:44.40]Looking for the phone with some pens on it.
[107:51.56]Not there.
[107:59.94]Okay, right here.
[108:04.74]Wooden box.
[108:07.20]A slightly heavy wooden box.
[108:10.76]Alright.
[108:12.58]That's all I got.
[108:13.32]A piece of wood.
[108:15.24]Come on, I can open this.
[108:18.87]Red dot sight for the lightning hawk.
[108:20.93]A custom part for the lightning hawk that allows for lightning fast aiming.
[108:25.95]Alright.
[108:26.67]Pretty cool.
[108:32.97]So then from... That's sick, but... The other one is with the boom box.
[108:44.78]I gotta get back out to the main hall.
[108:48.96]And then the first floor, it was like down here, right?
[108:53.42]East office or press room?
[109:03.35]I just got more film?
[109:04.65]Oh, what kind of wild goose chase is this putting me on?
[109:08.68]This is like a treasure hunt.
[109:14.76]I get the USB to go in the computer.
[109:16.72]I've got to go check the press room.
[109:18.36]I've got to watch out for the liquor.
[109:24.32]Alright.
[109:27.54]So I've got to back through back into the dark room
[109:39.80]Or maybe not.
[109:40.94]Yeah.
[109:42.70]So I gotta go back to get to the main hall again.
[109:46.24]Let's go to main.
[109:47.88]Keep searching the desk.
[109:51.24]What, there's like hidden prompts everywhere or something?
[109:53.24]Why do we get every single part of the stream is so boring?
[109:56.13]I'm not doing anything.
[109:57.53]I'm just like... How long is this board?
[110:00.49]It's eight hours for me to beat this game.
[110:03.89]And I can't fucking even shoot a guy.
[110:05.51]All right.
[110:09.78]I'm gonna do the same thing.
[110:10.66]I'm just gonna go down from here.
[110:12.78]And we're gonna develop this film.
[110:14.54]So we just have to slowly make our way away from the liquor.
[110:24.48]Through the shower.
[110:25.69]What do you mean wrong way?
[110:31.59]I'm going just back down to the... Hurry!
[110:34.41]Kiss him!
[110:35.09]USB, USB, USB.
[110:35.87]I already got the lightning.
[110:39.80]Forgot that, what do you mean?
[110:41.08]You're talking about going down?
[110:42.32]What are you guys talking about?
[110:43.44]I already did it.
[110:47.56]Yeah, I know, I have it.
[110:48.62]And then I'm gonna put that in the secret room downstairs.
[110:52.28]No, I know what's going on.
[110:57.63]Ten seconds for a scream!
[111:02.27]So then, let's just go.
[111:03.25]Fuck it.
[111:06.69]Running out of time here.
[111:07.69]It's gone.
[111:10.23]Mafia 3.
[111:10.73]That was so brutal.
[111:15.37]Can we get in this car?
[111:19.00]I pushed his face into the ground from standing.
[111:23.10]No witness.
[111:27.06]Holy shit.
[111:30.72]Running out of time.
[111:32.63]Made it to the bar.
[111:40.42]Alright, let's go.
[111:42.04]Why?
[111:42.24]It's like GTA.
[111:43.12]How come it's not working?
[111:44.24]I thought it was going to just instantly go to the mission.
[111:53.81]If you've never played Mafia, by the way, this spoiler is probably here.
[111:58.59]Welcome home, son.
[112:10.85]Super early?
[112:11.39]Yeah, it's an early stream.
[112:12.07]It's an early stream.
[112:12.91]Let's make a toast.
[112:13.69]Even though I just drove over like four people.
[112:15.95]Ignoring story.
[112:33.67]That's not confirmed yet.
[112:35.85]That's not confirmed yet.
[112:36.99]It's going on Oatwells.
[112:38.15]Oatwells.
[112:38.59]Thanks for two months, dude.
[112:40.12]Oh, cutscene.
[112:41.26]Ain't seen one of those in a while.
[112:44.34]Oh, that's such an ignoring.
[112:53.66]Cutscene.
[113:03.56]That's so my god.
[113:05.01]Oh, cutscene.
[113:05.95]The cutscene started like three minutes ago.
[113:09.01]Wow.
[113:09.47]Holy shit, dude.
[113:10.97]That was unbelievable.
[113:11.93]The cutscene started like two minutes ago.
[113:14.13]God damn it.
[113:14.85]Whatever.
[113:15.31]That was so bad.
[113:29.20]I didn't even know the cutscene started.
[113:31.20]Holy shit.
[113:31.64]What's the consensus of this game?
[113:32.76]What's, like, the, uh... What's, like, the reviews on it?
[113:36.20]Like, six.
[113:39.04]You didn't... What, you didn't know that before you started streaming it?
[113:41.36]Why?
[113:43.54]You knew it was a six.
[113:47.75]You knew it was a six before you started streaming it.
[113:50.11]You were just concerned that other people might not have liked it.
[113:53.07]It sucks?
[113:54.13]Doesn't really... Doesn't really... That doesn't really... Yeah, you knew that.
[113:59.52]Bad, bad, very bad, really.
[114:04.30]The story is good, but the gameplay is meh.
[114:12.33]Feels pretty fun so far.
[114:14.31]Feels pretty, feels, you hear that?
[114:16.99]You hear that?
[114:17.39]Feels, feels pretty fun.
[114:20.42]Why?
[114:21.48]I gotta work on that.
[114:22.28]I gotta work on that.
[114:24.02]I gotta work on that.
[114:26.33]Feels pretty good.
[114:27.11]Is this any good?
[114:27.91]Is this any good?
[114:29.63]Is this any?
[114:30.79]I gotta work on that.
[114:31.67]Bad port.
[114:32.71]Liar voice.
[114:33.39]I gotta work on that.
[114:34.15]I'm glad we're doing this.
[114:46.32]Bad aim could happen here.
[114:49.28]I need like a meditation video.
[114:57.24]I need to do a meditation.
[115:00.16]Guided meditation.
[115:02.31]Hold on.
[115:07.29]Drift it.
[115:11.57]What do we got here?
[115:12.25]Guided meditation?
[115:13.33]I have to do this, guys.
[115:14.13]I'm sorry.
[115:15.05]I'm like, I'm all fired up.
[115:25.18]Damn it, not a Star Wars shirt.
[115:26.34]I thought it was a Star Wars shirt.
[115:28.04]It was possible.
[115:30.79]What the fuck even, what happens here?
[115:34.59]It's supposed to be instructions.
[115:36.63]What happens here?
[115:37.19]Is this the cheers for you guy?
[115:42.91]Is this the cheers to you guy?
[115:44.77]I think this is the cheers to you.
[115:46.79]He's fucking sweaty?
[115:47.71]No, I'm not.
[115:54.79]We gotta get an armpit shot.
[115:56.19]We gotta get a shot of the underarm.
[115:58.27]If there's sweat under the underarm, sure.
[116:00.09]Observing the words I share with you.
[116:03.66]Like a soft breeze on a summer night.
[116:09.28]Has not been confirmed.
[116:10.48]Your body may begin to relax more and more.
[116:14.89]This is not fucking helping.
[116:15.89]As you listen to my voice and go deeper.
[116:20.37]How would somebody be able to sleep to this?
[116:22.64]Could you imagine?
[116:23.66]All right.
[116:24.10]Seriously, wait a second.
[116:25.82]Wait.
[116:27.48]Can you imagine if you were trying to go to sleep?
[116:30.16]Okay.
[116:31.08]You lay down and you're like, man, I really wish I had something to help me go to sleep.
[116:34.53]And I'm like, let me help you there.
[116:36.31]And I go right up to your fucking ear.
[116:37.89]And I'm like,
[116:39.96]Very soon you'll be sleeping.
[116:43.08]And just to let you know, it's so relaxing in this room.
[116:47.09]And very soon you'll be going to bed.
[116:50.05]Just like the breeze of a sunny summer Monday morning.
[116:52.79]That's not an impression.
[116:54.21]The way that you'll see the world.
[116:55.86]That's not an impression.
[116:57.30]What are you doing to me?
[116:58.50]I'm trying to sleep.
[116:59.56]I need complete silence and I need nobody talking.
[117:02.14]I don't want any lights on.
[117:04.68]That's not an impression.
[117:06.41]Alright, let's see if we can... Now I'm even more fucking on edge than I was before.
[117:10.23]It didn't help at all.
[117:11.51]No, that's not an impression.
[117:13.37]It's not an impression of that guy.
[117:14.35]That's me doing that video.
[117:15.61]No, it's not an impression.
[117:17.36]Not an impression.
[117:24.50]Where is my meditation?
[117:30.24]I just had it.
[117:31.18]Where is it?
[117:31.78]It's on a different window.
[117:32.86]What the fuck is this window?
[117:34.42]Why is it down here?
[117:35.76]Of course it was.
[117:37.34]Help me!
[117:37.94]Come on!
[117:38.76]No TF2 video.
[117:41.14]And we're good.
[117:42.76]No Nightwing shirt, no TF2 video.
[117:45.48]It may be that your body needs to heal in other ways.
[117:50.14]It's good to know that your unconscious mind is an expert in healing.
[117:58.66]Color in the molding box.
[118:00.70]Yeah, okay.
[118:01.34]We might as well just fucking color this in.
[118:04.76]This is the free space.
[118:08.88]You know what?
[118:09.18]Just fucking write it on there.
[118:11.94]Turn this shit off.
[118:13.71]Stop it.
[118:14.01]Just seriously write it down.
[118:17.27]Let me fucking relax.
[118:27.65]Because I drank a coke that's an ad?
[118:28.98]I drank a coke on camera and it's an ad.
[118:31.28]What?
[118:31.40]I can't drink a coke on camera?
[118:53.38]I need to actually go over this.
[118:57.43]Found cup marks around his wrists and ankles.
[118:59.31]Death by strangulation.
[119:00.89]TF2 video fall joke is bad.
[119:04.64]A real rumor moment is bad too.
[119:07.10]Yeah, seems like the killer may have robbed him on previous victories.
[119:12.10]Not victories.
[119:15.01]Couldn't find the kid's wallet.
[119:15.85]What the hell is going on?
[119:20.60]Oh, I forgot about this.
[119:22.72]I did this shit, right?
[119:23.96]I recorded myself for five minutes before stream.
[119:28.41]God damn it.
[119:29.07]I'm on.
[119:29.95]I'm off.
[119:30.97]Right.
[119:31.35]I forgot about that.
[119:32.43]I did a full like five to ten minutes of recorded face cam before the stream turned on.
[119:35.91]I'm going to head back to the office.
[119:37.15]And it was voted one of the worst jokes of the year, right?
[119:39.80]Two years ago?
[119:40.80]This is ruining the game for me.
[119:41.92]I'm too angry.
[119:42.68]It's just too hard.
[119:43.76]Oh, it's going to get so much worse.
[119:47.46]I'll let you know if we find anything else.
[119:48.66]All right.
[119:49.76]Yeah, that was the worst joke that took... Yeah, I remember that.
[119:51.78]That was two years ago.
[119:54.76]Why does that guy have that move?
[119:55.82]Why does that guy die?
[119:56.56]Why does that guy die in one hit?
[119:57.78]He just should die in one hit.
[119:59.72]Jerma mocking him getting mad at a video game should have been on here.
[120:04.07]The same people who make this game?
[120:07.45]Jeremy getting angry at a game is one thing, but then he mocks how mad he was and how embarrassed he is that he got that angry in the first place.
[120:15.28]That's a great song.
[120:17.00]That could have been a square.
[120:20.26]Bad aim incoming.
[120:21.38]We have 50 seconds to see it.
[120:23.30]Hey guys, just got the masks we ordered.
[120:26.86]Pretty cool, eh?
[120:31.70]They're all chickens.
[120:32.42]Well, how do they feel?
[120:33.24]You like them?
[120:34.50]No gameplay at all yet, guys.
[120:37.88]Zero.
[120:39.70]Zero gameplay.
[120:40.77]What?
[120:40.89]I'm not sure I fell.
[120:50.02]I'll get it!
[120:51.24]What's next?
[120:51.66]L.A.
[120:52.08]Noire, part 3.
[121:23.79]That's it.
[121:24.05]Wait, what are you looking at?
[121:27.81]Can I help?
[121:33.50]I gave up on this game, by the way.
[121:39.26]Alright, that's it.
[121:39.70]There's blood all over the door.
[121:44.61]I got like three or four streams into this, and then somebody told me, dude, you got like another 30 or 40 hours.
[121:50.40]And I was like, ugh.
[121:54.76]Okay.
[121:55.50]That was fun.
[122:00.24]Wait.
[122:02.22]Matches.
[122:02.72]Matches are never anything.
[122:04.18]Ever.
[122:06.51]It's never matches.
[122:07.45]That's a one guy moment?
[122:10.47]How?
[122:12.09]What do you mean that was a one-guy moment?
[122:13.13]What are you talking about?
[122:14.75]How?
[122:23.03]I just still feel these seeds in my mouth.
[122:24.64]I'm gonna have to go fucking throw up.
[122:28.06]One-guy moment.
[122:28.72]It happened.
[122:29.12]You said it did.
[122:34.14]It didn't happen in the video, no.
[122:36.50]Not at this part, no.
[122:37.30]They're in my teeth.
[122:40.60]It's bad.
[122:49.28]I can't wait until we get the 1% chance for Otto's Great Adventure 2, and I've used my third veto over the night to get rid of it.
[122:57.76]Shoo.
[122:57.90]Okay.
[122:58.04]Shoo on head.
[123:13.65]I better put this on my hit or chat will think it's pre-recorded.
[123:16.62]That was good.
[123:17.26]That was good.
[123:17.68]Where's like the good fucking joke square?
[123:20.24]Where's the good joke square?
[123:21.48]Because that was a good one.
[123:22.42]I'm the god.
[123:33.42]We kept the area pristine for you boys.
[123:35.28]That's too rare to have it be a square.
[123:39.20]Boston accent was going to be one too.
[123:41.56]In pre-stream we were trying to talk about what should be here.
[123:43.92]Boston accent was a square.
[123:45.48]And I got rid of it last second.
[123:51.17]Nothing.
[123:53.85]God damn it.
[123:57.61]Oh, there is a... 15 seconds.
[124:04.32]five house keys strung up like bait on a there is 3 200 hours of footage where will we oh never mind this is a huge crime scene I said five seconds I said five seconds remain like what I can't say that you get the timer on the screen I'm reacting to the same timer that you have on your screen that's got to be a code safer
[124:35.37]253.
[124:36.35]Memorize that.
[124:39.07]That was such a waste for an extension.
[124:42.52]Nothing happening.
[124:46.94]What's 253?
[124:47.68]What is 253?
[124:51.64]Why are you guys saying 253?
[124:53.93]I'm not going to veto this.
[124:55.67]What a waste.
[125:01.07]What is on the roof?
[125:05.12]Oh, it was the note.
[125:06.00]Alright.
[125:07.62]That was record time.
[125:09.16]That was record roof time.
[125:20.14]No, don't do it.
[125:21.29]Don't do it.
[125:22.43]Don't do it.
[125:23.11]Don't fall off the edge.
[125:24.85]Do not walk off this edge.
[125:27.25]Ah, now that sounds like a title of a great movie.
[125:30.05]Do not.
[125:30.47]Don't.
[125:30.99]It's not worth it, Jeremy.
[125:32.31]Don't do it.
[125:32.95]Three years ago, Jeremy.
[125:34.17]Don't walk off the edge.
[125:36.19]Okay, Mrs. A. Maldonado.
[125:39.31]I know you probably think it's going to be very, very funny, but it's not going to be funny.
[125:43.03]Don't do it.
[125:44.03]Federal offense.
[125:45.69]Empty?
[125:46.53]Where is all of this meant to be taking us?
[125:48.23]Don't fall off the fucking edge.
[125:49.65]Okay.
[125:52.11]Don't do it.
[125:52.55]He clearly wants us to find these things.
[125:54.08]He left them for us.
[125:57.86]Oh!
[126:00.90]More blood.
[126:01.62]A DS.
[126:02.96]That was funny.
[126:14.65]I'm laughing at that one.
[126:15.69]I don't care if it's me.
[126:17.16]It was fucking four years ago.
[126:18.84]I don't remember saying that.
[126:20.26]That was funny.
[126:21.28]That was funny.
[126:22.02]I liked that one.
[126:24.50]If it were any other streamer doing that, I would have laughed at it.
[126:26.64]That was a funny joke, guy, from four years ago.
[126:34.11]New Super Mario Bros.
[126:36.41]DS.
[126:37.53]That game's not good.
[126:39.77]Who has this much blood?
[126:42.41]You would have died two pipes ago.
[126:44.25]Okay?
[126:49.66]Here comes the fall joke.
[126:51.16]I'm probably gonna do it.
[126:52.88]And that's the worst part about this.
[127:19.35]Looks as though the killer was decorating with this.
[127:25.17]He's just a sick fuck.
[127:26.23]Okay.
[127:27.99]Here it comes.
[127:28.47]Here it comes.
[127:30.31]Red bag.
[127:37.08]Don't do it.
[127:37.80]The other half.
[127:39.40]I'm not this much of a dickhead.
[127:43.58]Mrs. Antonia Maldonado, 712 North Hill Street, downtown.
[127:48.79]No, I'm not this much of a dickhead.
[127:49.99]I wouldn't just walk off the edge.
[127:51.01]Okay, well, we have an address.
[127:52.05]I think that's the end of the trail.
[127:59.92]Oh, we almost did it.
[128:01.24]Yeah, it kind of has to be.
[128:08.85]Too bad to all those people that wasted their points.
[128:12.32]Thinking there was going to be a fall joke.
[128:14.50]Sorry, guys.
[128:17.73]My god.
[128:18.49]That was an explosion.
[128:23.82]It was Mrs. Maldonado, right?
[128:25.62]That's affirmative.
[128:26.36]All right, so then there's a husband we should be looking for.
[128:29.55]Get him.
[128:30.47]We've closed the case.
[128:31.95]Ah, Rusty's razor, of course.
[128:34.15]I don't want to question your tried and tested technique.
[128:36.57]I'm going to T again.
[128:37.25]I'm going to be pissing on C. But doesn't the DA require sound casework before he'll close the book?
[128:42.03]No, he's got a confession.
[128:44.47]And, you know, there's ways of getting it.
[128:46.79]I'm sure.
[128:50.73]We didn't have any testings in a...
[128:55.16]Wait, why is this one black?
[129:00.23]Oh, fuck.
[129:03.07]Oh, no.
[129:04.29]It was actually to your benefit.
[129:07.46]Oh.
[129:19.61]Yeah, imagine you didn't have a stomach.
[129:20.93]No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it.
[129:24.06]You guys don't realize, your body is a gigantic coin separation machine.
[129:28.26]You know those old machines you put in the dime, the nickel, the quarter, and it would go, and put it in the right slot?
[129:34.28]If your body didn't have one of those down there, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
[129:37.74]That's true.
[129:39.54]I get it.
[129:39.98]I know what he's saying.
[129:40.96]But the weird thing, though, is even those machines, sometimes you'd put a penny in, and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot.
[129:47.02]So why are our bodies so good at it?
[129:50.95]come how come a nickel doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes if you if you catch my drift whoa there sometimes I read the one comment that makes me laugh are you this stupid on purpose
[130:26.03]I'm here which one's kenny tables are turned now haven't they boys hey look old man we're sorry well kenny's not here kenny's not in this scene blatant one guy moment I know
[131:03.32]That wasn't bad aim!
[131:04.38]No, that wasn't bad aim.
[131:06.02]That was fine.
[131:10.87]That was not bad aim.
[131:11.85]I shot once and I was running.
[131:17.23]Blatant bad aim has to be very, very much confirmed.
[131:36.84]It's got to be like, holy shit, that was horrendous.
[131:41.37]I want to subdue the last one.
[131:43.13]I want to scream either.
[131:44.01]Got to reload.
[131:48.09]He's got to reload.
[131:49.65]How do I tackle him?
[131:55.65]No, a scream is like... It's got to be fucking a scream.
[132:00.63]It can't be like... I tried to hit X. X is usually tackle.
[132:05.38]It's got to be like...
[132:09.26]It's time to eat lots of bacon.
[132:12.56]This is car 11K.
[132:13.80]Shots fired at South Flower Street, Scott's Garage.
[132:17.02]It's code 4 here, but suspect is down.
[132:19.22]I need an ambulance and coroner.
[132:21.76]Code 4.
[132:23.62]So the guy did die.
[132:24.66]11K, roger on the ambulance and coroner.
[132:27.20]All units, 11K reports code 4 on the shooting at 14 South Flower Street, Scott's Garage.
[132:31.82]Code 4.
[132:35.57]Mr. 985, you've already had too much bacon.
[132:38.91]What do we got?
[132:41.23]I'm surprised no shirts.
[132:43.15]No Nightwing shirt, no Star Wars shirt.
[132:45.07]No clip maps.
[132:45.81]I do that all the time.
[132:46.55]Do you guys eat eggs in one bite?
[132:49.93]Or do you cut them up and let all the fucking goo go everywhere?
[132:53.02]Gross.
[132:53.54]One bite.
[132:53.84]If you go to a breakfast place and you order, oh, two sunny side up eggs or two over easy, whatever.
[132:59.28]Holy shit, I'm not even fucking...
[133:08.22]I wasn't even looking.
[133:12.87]Watching this shit from an audience perspective, like, sometimes I'm just, I'm gone.
[133:21.58]When I'm talking like this, I'm gone.
[133:24.74]I'm not even, the game is not even here.
[133:27.37]It's like, I'm just talking, and there's nothing here, and I just drive into shit.
[133:32.86]I don't understand.
[133:33.68]Where we going?
[133:35.72]Let me restart it.
[133:37.78]TurboStream's chat playing games.
[133:54.93]We got Cul-de-sac Smash, uh, Ed Eddetti's Candy Machine, Lunchroom Rumble, or Spin Stadium.
[134:01.83]By the way, the title says Nickelodeon.
[134:06.13]Click map there, though.
[134:16.34]Okay, we've got Cul-de-sac Smash.
[134:21.04]And there was a fucking rumor there, too.
[134:28.58]Got pretty good radio, 44 million plays.
[134:30.98]Two in a row, you gotta be kidding me.
[134:34.34]Looks like this is gonna be the one.
[134:37.16]Uh-oh.
[134:39.43]No TF2 video.
[134:43.39]Let's see how it is.
[134:49.35]I don't even remember this stream.
[134:51.07]Here we go.
[134:54.23]Cul-de-sac smash!
[135:00.67]Okay, instructions.
[135:01.49]Accelerate.
[135:02.95]Let's turn it up a little.
[135:03.65]The ad's already filled in.
[135:08.91]I can't do this.
[135:11.39]This music is gonna make me fucking scream.
[135:16.05]This is nightmare music.
[135:17.29]I've heard, win each derby to advance to the next location.
[135:19.37]There's four ads.
[135:20.17]I can't even talk.
[135:20.93]I have to take my headphones off.
[135:23.17]Win each derby to advance to the next location.
[135:24.93]Earn cash by competing in the derbies.
[135:27.23]Then make repairs and build new go-karts in the shop.
[135:32.25]When you collision, the faster go-kart does more damage.
[135:34.43]Keep an eye on your damage meter.
[135:36.69]Okay.
[135:38.01]She's a driver.
[135:38.53]Go ahead.
[135:43.38]Does that just mean fast music?
[135:45.96]That's like cartoon fast?
[135:49.16]What does that mean?
[135:50.52]That's fast cartoon music.
[135:52.42]Remember, that is an option.
[136:03.50]Don't say an emote.
[136:04.28]I feel it.
[136:08.44]Okay, looks like we're gonna be... Ed.
[136:13.22]Here comes an impression.
[136:14.08]I'm gonna go... All right, Ed.
[136:16.30]Oh, Eddie.
[136:17.58]Oh, listen.
[136:18.48]I'm gonna do it.
[136:19.26]The impression, is it filled in?
[136:20.22]This is all locked anyways.
[136:21.44]It's already filled in.
[136:22.44]Don't fucking matter.
[136:23.10]Get a dollar for first prize.
[136:24.36]I'm gonna do it.
[136:25.08]Okay, I'm ready.
[136:26.01]Zippy, pick a go-kart.
[136:27.73]If I have an excuse to do an Ed voice, like an Eddie voice... All right.
[136:32.36]Oh, I'll do it.
[136:33.36]I'll do it every time.
[136:34.80]There's probably three impressions in this part of the screen.
[136:38.60]This is so loud.
[136:39.70]Turn off the click maps, are you stupid?
[136:45.09]Oh shit, this is on screen.
[136:48.09]Get off the screen.
[137:01.41]How are you supposed to play this?
[137:07.22]I don't understand what's happening.
[137:08.42]Is this just bumper cars?
[137:10.00]Could have done the loud game.
[137:11.34]Yeah.
[137:13.82]I guess.
[137:22.87]Rolf is out.
[137:27.19]Why is Eddie just Bernie Sanders?
[137:29.59]What?
[137:31.93]okay so what we're gonna do is we are gonna just unfortunately the one percent has all of the money all right and we've gotta take it away uh I mean kind of not really though that was fun all right okay uh that was ed ed and eddie thanks for playing ed ed and eddie I hated that you can tell

[138:17.58]Let me, can I piss?
[138:19.94]I was like, rage drinking water.

[139:01.62]Uh-oh.
[139:03.24]This is, uh... This could happen.
[139:08.03]If you thought there was no chance that this was gonna happen, I got news for you.
[139:12.29]I used to do that once every other day.
[139:17.07]Where we going?
[139:20.19]Oh, no, no, no, not a face cam.
[139:21.35]It's possible.
[139:25.03]I fucked it up.
[139:25.83]It's okay.
[139:26.44]That was tricky.
[139:28.80]Oh, I'm gonna do it!
[139:29.93]Well, I mean... You gotta see it once or twice before you know when the things are happening.
[139:34.85]If your skill was a business trip, you'd miss a meeting down the hall.
[139:40.42]They left hairline.
[139:59.01]God damn it.
[139:59.83]You gotta be kidding me.
[140:01.65]30 goddamn 5 in 2020.
[140:05.41]This is looking pretty good for 3.5.
[140:07.09]Now excuse me, I've got some donk donks to take care of.
[140:13.17]The shirt?
[140:13.73]No, that is not a Star Wars shirt.
[140:17.23]It's not a Star Wars shirt.
[140:19.59]Or a Nightwing shirt.
[140:24.29]This is before I got very very upset.
[140:35.69]I said an emote?
[140:36.39]What emote did I say?
[140:38.29]What was the emote?
[140:39.74]What emote?
[140:41.44]Wait, what did I say?
[140:42.22]You said Pepe laugh?
[140:48.03]Oh, shit!
[140:49.05]Where is it?
[140:52.17]Fuck!
[140:54.66]Where is it?
[140:55.30]Oh, we got, like, three right now.
[140:58.48]Oh, shit.
[140:59.12]No, look at me.
[141:01.90]It's no beta.
[141:22.76]Don't do it.
[141:26.18]I'm too distracted to do the lion pose.
[141:28.50]It's not going to happen.
[141:31.12]That's not mouth music.
[141:32.32]Me going... I can...
[141:51.60]That's not mouth music!
[141:52.92]Mouth music is like me humming a beat, or me beatboxing, or me, like, singing, uh, not going like, eh, eh!
[142:08.18]If you get a purpose on Remix 4 right now, you'll, no, I'm not, I can't, I can't throw that, I'm trying to do Remix 6.
[142:20.33]Uh-oh, don't do it.
[142:22.05]I can feel myself looking into the camera.
[142:24.75]You are a mule.
[142:25.51]I'm doing that pose.
[142:27.87]Okay, face Billy.
[142:32.34]If I win by a large amount on one of these, I'm gonna do it.
[142:35.60]One, two, three.
[142:36.00]One, two, three.
[142:48.40]No scream either.
[142:49.82]That's kind of crazy.
[143:03.00]Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
[143:38.21]God damn it!
[143:39.63]You fucking idiot!
[143:41.15]You stupid asshole!
[143:42.81]God damn it!
[143:49.42]Just hit every shot from now on.
[143:51.64]Please.
[144:03.66]That wasn't a scream.
[144:04.34]That was a yawn.
[144:05.06]That was a loud yawn.
[144:06.10]That was not a scream.
[144:16.93]No.
[144:19.06]Scream has to be very, very clear.
[144:20.64]Do not do any bad aim.
[144:27.27]No TF2 videos.
[144:28.43]I don't have any rhythm.
[144:30.01]Something that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the remixes, it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs that intercut into each other.
[144:45.34]That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's... Stop.
[144:53.20]If I fall, I just need to... You know what I mean?
[144:56.42]You panic.
[144:57.46]Scream.
[144:59.92]Because you know you're going to be skidding.
[145:03.52]Here comes the scream.
[145:05.69]This is late game, too.
[145:06.83]I was fucking... What happened there?
[145:08.97]What happened there?
[145:10.05]I did a full jump.
[145:11.27]That's worked every single time.
[145:14.26]I did a full jump.
[145:15.00]What the fuck happened?
[145:18.50]I did a full jump.
[145:19.26]That's worked every time.
[145:21.26]Come on, man.
[145:22.06]What?
[145:24.70]That's not a fall joke.
[145:26.38]Fall joke is somewhere where you're not supposed to fall ever.
[145:30.60]You walked off the edge.
[145:32.74]I'm waiting for a scream.
[145:33.64]Sorry, I forgot.
[145:34.24]I'm playing Aggravation Simulator.
[145:36.34]Just rename it.
[145:37.18]Just do it.
[145:37.98]Oh, I called this Jump King.
[145:51.06]Like, just rename this game, I'm trying to piss you off.
[145:55.10]That's it, that's what it should be called.
[146:00.45]This is not about jumping.
[146:02.21]This is about trying to make as many people angry as possible.
[146:14.04]Terrible aim?
[146:14.50]I think this shit was in an episode of Dexter's Lab one time.
[146:17.46]There was, like, an evil guy that, like, didn't want to make everybody, like, sad, or, like, angry, and gave them, like, a video game to play, and it, like, worked?
[146:26.77]Oh, no, sorry, that's the- that's Jump King.
[146:28.55]Right.
[146:32.03]What the fuck is he talking about?
[146:33.37]I think that's the same thing.
[146:39.24]If you miss a ju- no, you miss ju- that's the whole point of the game, is to miss jumps.
[146:44.57]That was the Powerpuff Girls.
[146:46.83]What was it from?
[146:53.17]That's from Phineas and Ferb.
[146:56.48]Is that show still on here?
[147:01.24]Are they still making new Phineas and Ferb cartoons?
[147:08.43]No talking about Vegas either, which is weird.
[147:12.44]I'm going to get up to the top.
[147:13.74]How far are we into the VOD?
[147:15.65]Thank God, no.
[147:16.17]About halfway.
[147:19.19]What?
[147:19.91]What's wrong?
[147:20.35]Why?
[147:20.51]What's wrong?
[147:21.91]I'm going to get up there and scream.
[147:22.91]What's wrong with Phineas and Ferb?
[147:23.97]Did it end it?
[147:29.25]Did it really?
[147:32.00]Once I get to the end game here.
[147:32.82]I haven't watched the show, but what's wrong with it?
[147:35.66]Phineas and Ferb was the only good New Age cartoon show.
[147:41.80]Was it years ago?
[147:48.76]I didn't say... I was... Somebody in chat said that.
[147:50.78]I didn't say that.
[147:51.23]What are some of the cartoons that were worth watching?
[147:53.07]I don't remember.
[147:56.65]That's not me talking!
[147:57.51]That's me responding to chat!
[147:58.61]Come on!
[147:59.01]That's not me saying that!
[148:02.59]That's not me saying that.
[148:20.22]Nope.
[148:20.96]Holy shit, that's an odd one.
[148:23.16]How do you get that jump?
[148:25.38]Holy fuck, how are you supposed to get that?
[148:31.72]We're good.
[148:33.48]Didn't say shit.
[148:36.70]Wait, that's the first time I've seen this.
[148:38.78]Oh, boy.
[148:39.30]I sound pretty calm.
[148:58.66]I held it for long enough.
[148:59.46]Oh well.
[149:00.80]Am I defeated at this point or what?
[149:21.82]Fall all the way.
[149:23.80]Fall all the way down to the candles.
[149:25.76]And I'll probably scream.
[149:29.71]Here it comes Not saved Wow that set the jump to the The jump to the It's just so hard to judge it even when you do a little one.
[149:49.65]It doesn't seem like it's enough Wow
[149:59.83]That's remarkable.
[150:04.79]It's already filled in.
[150:05.59]Don't even say it.
[150:06.29]It's been filled in.
[150:07.97]Come on.
[150:08.33]Get up there.
[150:10.24]Only a minute left.
[150:12.26]Before this is done.
[150:13.14]I'll be back in an hour.
[150:15.24]Hey, I'm gonna go get some boots.
[150:16.12]What size are you?
[150:18.00]Sixteen.
[150:22.82]I got these big-ass goofy feet.
[150:35.72]No, I'm still perfectly fine at this point in the bot.
[150:43.17]You got one more chance up here when I get up here.
[150:45.05]Didn't make that.
[150:45.57]What?
[150:46.65]Why did I not make that?
[150:48.21]What the fuck?
[150:49.59]Wait, what?
[150:51.89]What?
[150:55.93]How did I not make it over that?
[150:57.41]Is this the same person?
[150:58.57]I don't understand.
[150:59.37]What?
[151:01.59]What?
[151:03.25]I'm shocked.
[151:05.31]Why am I so calm?
[151:07.19]Because it's wasted breath to be angry at a game.
[151:09.53]It was designed to make you hate everything about your current life, what you're doing right now.
[151:18.90]I'm not going to let it win.
[151:20.06]I'm not going to give it the satisfaction.
[151:23.48]Sorry to say.
[151:24.14]TV Robo!
[151:28.50]Well, plan on it.
[151:32.88]This is the last week!
[151:33.91]I don't know.
[151:35.03]Look, I got all this to do first.
[151:37.15]We got Mario Sunshine to do first.
[151:39.15]That's priority number one.
[151:40.21]Did that.
[151:40.65]That was fun.
[151:43.39]We're slowly going up the rankings now.
[151:44.81]This is pretty early in Chibi-Robo.
[151:54.90]Same joke as last week?
[151:56.64]I also played those old Zelda games when they first came out.
[152:03.89]I did Ocarina of Time.
[152:04.91]I don't think I ever beat George in the mask.
[152:11.18]Lion pose!
[152:11.50]So, where are we going?
[152:14.96]Cry of Fear co-op highlights!
[152:17.00]Alright.
[152:17.54]Okay, I'm gonna say something.
[152:23.26]When?
[152:23.56]Where?
[152:23.88]What are we talking about?
[152:27.21]Uh oh.
[152:28.39]Where are we going?
[152:28.83]I'm gonna say something.
[152:29.67]Is there a lion pose here?
[152:32.29]Nah.
[152:37.48]This is a real, real opinion that everyone's going to hate me for.
[152:41.24]What do you mean the thumbnail?
[152:43.66]What?
[152:43.92]I think I've said this before on stream.
[152:48.54]Zelda games, although I respect everything they've done for the industry, I respect it as a series.
[152:57.39]I understand why people love it.
[153:01.73]They don't do it for me.
[153:04.51]Zelda games don't do it for me.
[153:07.19]That's it.
[153:08.63]That doesn't count.
[153:10.25]That does not count.
[153:11.83]It doesn't count.
[153:14.89]It doesn't really do it for me.
[153:16.55]That's not the video I was watching.
[153:19.07]That's a separate video.
[153:25.20]Oh, my fucking stomach.
[153:27.04]Retreat encore night.
[153:30.80]Retreat encore night.
[153:36.74]Oh, my stomach.
[153:50.93]Oh, you tripped it.
[153:51.79]That was really good.
[153:53.81]That was really good.
[153:54.57]Lion pose possible.
[153:55.53]Lion pose.
[153:55.81]We don't want to get any spoilers.
[153:58.48]I keep fucking going to this.
[154:02.36]I don't want any spoilers.
[154:05.32]We're out of...
[154:08.06]All right.
[154:09.51]Let's take a quick pee break.
[154:13.85]Thank God.
[154:14.43]See you guys in like two minutes.
[154:17.15]Oh, thank God.
[154:17.81]We're at pretty much the halfway point.
[154:21.09]Please, please take a piss for seven straight minutes.
[154:24.80]Oh, I gotta get some water.
[154:25.74]Take a seven straight piss.
[154:27.70]Oh, wow.
[154:28.26]Thank God for that fucking RNG.
[154:29.56]Saved by the RN God.
[154:31.42]RNG God.
[154:35.34]This is empty.
[154:39.38]I can't fucking believe it's in that thumbnail.
[154:43.00]But it has to be in the video in the... That's so fucking funny.
[155:06.57]That is actually fucking funny.
[155:09.13]That, I mean, it does, but it doesn't count because it has to be in the stream or in the video that we're currently, the time that we have.
[155:18.50]It can't be in the thumbnail for a different video.
[155:25.33]But that should give you confidence that within the next hour that it's going to show up somewhere because if that was in a thumbnail,
[155:35.83]That means I do that shit all the fucking time.
[155:53.06]You have an opportunity with the lion pose.
[155:56.00]Terrible aim.
[156:01.63]This one's the most likely to happen.
[156:03.07]Before this, for sure.
[156:06.18]I'm so glad we hit this right here.
[156:08.50]Because this is green screen movie night.
[156:09.82]This is... I'm so... So many of these could happen in here.
[156:23.05]Technical difficulty?
[156:23.95]Why?
[156:24.21]Am I going to the bathroom?
[156:33.07]A laughing fit could happen here, too.
[156:34.99]And then we just need a Star Wars shirt.
[156:43.15]Bad aim to the toilet.
[156:44.73]Oh, I see.
[156:46.09]I see what you're doing.
[156:47.43]I get it.
[156:47.73]This is how long it takes, huh?
[156:54.22]What do you guys do when I go BRB?
[156:57.66]What do you guys do?
[157:03.29]Go pee?
[157:05.09]Do you leave too?
[157:08.64]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's the whole five minutes.
[157:12.80]That'd be great.
[157:24.43]Alright.
[157:24.69]I'm back.
[157:26.99]He's back, fuck.
[157:30.15]He's back.
[157:32.08]So far, these have been fucking fantastic.
[157:39.88]That was a turbo vroom.
[157:42.60]He's back.
[157:43.10]He's back.
[157:43.54]Yeah, I'm back.
[157:46.47]We're good.
[157:49.27]Alright, so coming up next, this one is called... I hope you're back.
[157:55.03]Hyperdimension Germania.
[157:56.81]Elbertson Breaker.
[157:58.74]What?
[158:00.72]Sounds good to me.
[158:01.44]All we need is a baseball video.
[158:04.38]Already got an interesting start.
[158:06.10]All we need is a baseball video?
[158:07.36]That's true.
[158:09.49]And you'll get a laugh.
[158:10.29]Three, two, one.
[158:12.07]Here we go.
[158:16.83]Life is pain.
[158:18.41]Life is pain.
[158:19.25]You're dead.
[158:20.07]I hate... Oh, look at this.
[158:28.22]Look at this.
[158:29.85]I just shit my pants!
[158:34.97]Holy shit!
[158:59.91]That was quick.
[159:00.75]DRIVE THUNDER FOR A CLEAN MACHINE!
[159:05.33]BOOM BOOM!
[159:06.13]What the fuck is that?
[159:35.58]I gotta see this one again.
[160:00.56]This is, I love this.
[160:06.77]Why?
[160:09.05]This one is called, Images of German 985 Real.
[160:14.05]Do not watch at night.
[160:16.91]Hopefully it's not night wherever any of you are.
[160:19.94]Oh, we're getting close.
[160:35.51]A Star Wars shirt ends this whole thing.
[160:39.74]Terrible aim ends this whole thing.
[160:43.88]The lion pose ends this whole thing.
[160:45.70]MS-DOS games?
[161:06.96]Um... Replace this line with your specific CD-ROM driver line.
[161:11.99]You only need to use this line with DOS 6.
[161:15.27]Can CD-ROM to book?
[161:20.36]Oh yeah, you had to punch in some shit, right?
[161:22.86]Because in the manual, it didn't work.
[161:26.24]Course 1...
[161:30.31]Yeah, that course quiz.
[161:31.79]Before playing the game, you'll be asked to identify a piece of track from one of the five courses.
[161:35.65]Ignore the page reference.
[161:36.89]Use your mouse pointer to the correct piece.
[161:39.13]A10?
[161:39.51]God damn it!
[161:42.22]G77?
[161:47.24]That's a bingo.
[161:48.80]That's a bingo.
[161:59.01]Hold on, let me...
[162:03.85]stunt driver.
[162:04.43]Hold on.
[162:04.71]Let's bring this together.
[162:13.32]Course quiz on course two, page 40.
[162:15.70]On course two, what is the piece at location question mark?
[162:27.51]At course two, what is the PSAT location?
[162:31.87]I-5?
[162:33.27]I said three hours, right?
[162:34.53]I said within three hours, if it happens.
[162:37.63]I needed 15 more minutes.
[162:39.67]Course two.
[162:41.95]I-5.
[162:42.07]I can't... Is it one, two, three, four, five?
[162:51.35]Yeah, this is me meeting... I can't play the game.
[162:53.74]That's a technical difficulty.
[162:59.12]Straight line with an oil can on the right.
[163:09.71]I think it's this one.
[163:11.33]Hold on.
[163:15.29]Alright, here we go.
[163:16.49]How do you drive?
[163:26.80]Hold on.
[163:37.04]I don't know how to get my hand on it.
[163:38.76]Control-Alt.
[163:40.68]P. Q. R. R is... He fucked it up, it's alright.
[164:06.38]You're going the wrong way!
[164:08.72]Scream!
[164:09.42]Turn the car around!
[164:15.70]Q?
[164:16.32]How do I gear it into... Got it.
[164:29.22]Get it out of neutral!
[164:35.50]I can't put it in first gear!
[164:44.38]Oh no!
[164:45.25]Watch out for the Skittles!
[164:48.11]Let's go.
[164:50.77]We're in the M&M's candy world!
[164:59.38]Oh my god.
[165:07.33]Derma Gaming, oh my god, I can't believe it!

[167:59.92]Thank you.
[168:02.19]Yeah, here we are.
[168:03.97]It was like, hey, by the way, somebody's done, like, more than $1,000 on your PayPal account.
[168:09.35]Interesting, wow.
[168:11.20]Is this you, dude?
[168:13.04]Yeah, it's me.
[168:16.68]Yeah, it's me.
[168:19.58]Hold on.
[168:20.28]Oh, my God, somebody else did it.
[168:24.83]We are sorry.
[168:25.81]Let's go.
[168:26.33]We are delaying our new game to 2013.
[168:29.33]Hold on, I got fraud alerted.
[168:32.33]Yeah, I know.
[168:36.15]Not many of you here today, unfortunately.
[168:39.31]We're delaying our new game to 2013.
[168:40.87]There's a hundred subs from Austin Lane.
[168:43.13]A few days ago, a few days later, when we reached out to Warner Brothers, we were assured the delay would be brought under control.
[168:52.40]At least for now.
[168:53.64]But no further information was forthcoming.
[168:55.54]Hold on, I gotta change this.
[168:57.12]At some point in 2011, we also came across an official FAQ from Warner Brothers that stated...
[169:04.77]Let's do it again.
[169:05.19]We would like to thank you for your great love and support of the Kingdom Hearts franchise.
[169:09.21]What the fuck is happening on this stream?
[169:11.49]Somebody else gave a hundred.
[169:12.67]I just gave a hundred.
[169:13.51]Did it go through?
[169:15.21]Holy shit.
[169:17.00]Every single person's gonna get subbed to this channel.
[169:21.88]Every single fucking person will be subbed.
[169:24.60]In this chat right now.
[169:26.06]Advertisement.
[169:28.24]This is where the story started.
[169:31.05]A few weeks ago, Warner Brothers released a press release that announced a series of new games for Kingdom Hearts 2.
[169:37.17]One of the most popular things about Kingdom Hearts fans is the fact that this series takes on so many different forms, including the addition of a new game feature featuring a new game in Kingdom Hearts 2, reads the press release.
[169:54.54]This is precisely what we'd like to introduce in Kingdom Hearts Unchained.
[170:00.81]Who just gave the 100 subs besides me?
[170:02.30]And that is all.
[170:05.36]Thank you.
[170:13.04]It was Abe Keshim.
[170:14.28]Oh, come on.
[170:14.76]Oh, come on.
[170:15.24]Fuck you.
[170:15.92]Yeah, I've wanted to say it for a very long time.
[170:19.22]Fuck you all.
[170:22.98]I got 100 more to do and that's it.
[170:27.25]100 more subs.
[170:28.63]This is 500 here.
[170:29.25]How could he say something like that?
[170:32.15]35 more seconds.
[170:57.03]No!
[170:57.41]God damn it!
[170:58.95]Wait, I gotta circle in scream, by the way.
[171:04.85]There's been at least three screams.
[171:05.89]No, that's like the meme!
[171:07.87]Like, my brain just typed the thing that's the meme!
[171:10.37]Ah, you idiot.
[171:11.07]What a fucking idiot.
[171:11.85]What an asshole.
[171:22.09]Where we going?
[171:25.54]Where are we going?
[171:26.28]Hold on.
[171:27.70]I get another alert from PayPal.
[171:32.16]No!
[171:33.78]No!
[171:34.72]No, of all the places to go.
[171:36.30]That guy.
[171:36.89]No, not the Karazhan stream.
[171:38.99]That is a geared up tank.
[171:41.27]This is a 0.52%.
[171:45.91]The worst stream of all time just got queued up there.
[171:48.13]It's just walking around side by side.
[171:49.56]No, no, no, no.
[171:50.06]Kill it.
[171:50.52]You tripped it.
[171:50.90]You tripped it.
[171:51.22]You tripped it.
[171:53.06]Is he DPS or...
[171:56.04]Holy shit, this is the worst stream I've ever done.
[172:03.54]I can't fucking believe Tarzan is here.
[172:06.57]Alright, just need a healer.
[172:09.87]Just need a healer.
[172:11.61]The one time I played WoW on stream.
[172:15.01]Yeah, sanctuaries are where the Horde and Alliance can both be.
[172:18.27]And they do not...
[172:20.11]Dude, did I forget my PayPal password?
[172:22.70]I can't even get into my PayPal.
[172:24.32]I walked out of my PayPal.
[172:30.06]And we're going to Blackrock Hold.
[172:37.54]I might get turned off for 24 hours.
[172:40.16]I think I just got turned off for 24 hours.
[172:43.29]We'll finish in... Come on, PayPal.
[172:47.81]I got the money.
[172:48.71]...over the edge.
[172:51.08]Heal us with your laugh.
[172:56.96]Oh, God, stop, Jeremy.
[172:59.29]Did it work?
[172:59.79]Walking around in fucking... Yeah, Burning Crusade was the first.
[173:02.85]Northrend.
[173:03.91]It's cool.
[173:06.93]You watch me from the toilet.
[173:10.88]Well.
[173:13.24]Hi.
[173:13.48]Okay, I think we're good.

[173:21.49]What's your eye level?
[173:22.55]Who the fuck is talking?
[173:24.79]854?

[174:15.88]That means you're going to have to get in here.
[174:18.87]dodged a sub you sound depressed in this video yeah because I'm playing warcraft on stream a bit too stuffy to talk oh it's hard to be excited about this game did you do the fell forge if I'm completely honest with you in that case yeah boo's sick he can't really talk but he can heal

[174:46.86]Well, after I check out the vendor.

[174:53.20]I will take you up on that offer, boo.
[174:57.04]Is this the... This person over here?
[174:58.69]No, this is the worst stream I've ever done.

[175:17.08]Holy fuck, this is so bad.
[175:18.68]Look how bad that looks.
[175:20.15]I never do the world quests that give it to me.
[175:21.69]Why do you have this?
[175:22.37]Why do you have that in your backpack?
[175:24.51]Why is that in your backpack?
[175:25.39]There's 15 teeth in here.
[175:28.63]Delete the teeth.
[175:30.23]There's 15 teeth.
[175:34.92]10 oh my god nobody wants to watch this unless you know what you're doing I have like a load I think I have like I have like at least like 40 or 50. I'm like on this character bottom tier player and I don't even know what I'm doing and I I I still I I still click the mouse on moves got a lot of money that was a lot of money back then holy go kill the world boss
[175:58.53]We could do that while we wait.
[176:00.15]Eight hours of this.
[176:01.81]No, let's just do that.
[176:04.42]Let's go kill the werewolf.
[176:05.24]Yes, this was.
[176:05.92]25,000 gold was not a lot of money four years ago, five years ago.
[176:11.04]Yes, it was.
[176:13.46]There's always an auto again.
[176:15.04]That was a decent amount of money at the end of the stream.
[176:17.83]But that's not going to be for a long time.
[176:24.35]High Mountain, right?
[176:24.89]Yeah, guys that are here for the dungeon.
[176:27.89]We're gonna just go get the world boss real quick.

[176:35.46]All stream.
[176:36.80]I remember, yeah, I remember this.
[176:38.86]That was another reason why this stream was so bad.
[176:40.88]That was in King.
[176:41.60]Where are you gonna fly to?
[176:45.07]Stonehoof or, uh... It was like, sick.
[176:55.46]Uh, stop.
[176:57.54]Where are you flying to?
[176:58.06]I'm watching wrestling, okay?
[177:01.54]I'm watching what you should be watching.
[177:03.34]You need to get geared up for this Sunday, Hell in a Cell.
[177:06.66]Where you're not going to know any of the storylines.
[177:09.13]I love how fucking tuned out you are right now.
[177:12.09]Yeah, what are you saying to me?
[177:14.01]I'm saying, where are you flying to to do the whirlwind?
[177:16.87]Blue to Ironhorn Enclave, which is a high mountain.
[177:22.91]I'm also about to blow my nose.
[177:25.20]I'm going to blow my... No!
[177:27.73]I fucking told you.
[177:28.91]I told you this is what happened.
[177:31.61]I told you.
[177:35.79]What time is it?
[177:37.51]It's 3 p.m.
[177:38.65]Metallics.
[177:44.26]What?
[177:46.54]Wrestling boss is in WoW.
[177:56.69]God, this is so boring!
[177:58.67]Wasn't even that loud.
[177:59.47]Oh, it got louder progressively.
[178:01.09]This is excruciating.
[178:03.85]Who did what again?
[178:04.93]He went like... And then he went... Action cam might be cool for melee.
[178:21.33]You can message people across realm, but you have to add the realm that they're in, as well as the name.
[178:30.08]Who's here?
[178:30.54]Who is it?
[178:31.00]Who goes there?
[178:32.14]Hello, stream.
[178:33.76]Oh, hi, Italics.
[178:36.46]I just woke up.
[178:39.20]You sound like you've got a raspy voice.
[178:41.80]Well, if you want to do Karazhan... Your voice has actually been getting better.
[178:47.23]Look at how fucking big that is!
[178:49.09]If you want to do Karazhan, Italics, there's a substantial attunement where you have to do four... Why is that covering the whole screen?
[178:55.39]I did hear that there was a big...
[178:57.99]Big deal.
[178:58.41]Thank fucking God we're out of here.
[179:00.79]Thank the Lord.
[179:02.83]Get us the fuck out of here.
[179:03.83]Alright, we're up here 74.
[179:09.68]Let me, uh, just give me one second.
[179:11.48]I want to check the patch.
[179:13.82]Now we're in the Punisher.
[179:19.35]We got a bad... Punisher uncut patch.
[179:21.31]I mean, it's already done.
[179:22.81]We already did this.
[179:23.53]It's already over.
[179:27.84]The gore level setting, it's high or none.
[179:29.52]I already changed it.
[179:36.65]What about a full blackout?
[179:39.57]A full blackout is just, I mean... That's gonna be very difficult to do.
[179:46.27]Go for double bingo?
[179:47.49]No, no, I can't gift any more subs.
[179:51.99]PayPal is gonna seriously, like, call me.
[179:56.05]If I give another 100 community subs, I'm going to get called by PayPal.
[179:59.18]They're going to be like, hey, dude, like somebody guaranteed hacked your account.
[180:03.36]Guaranteed.
[180:04.96]I'm going to be like, no, they didn't actually.
[180:10.63]PC Gaming Wicked Gore Patch 3.5.
[180:13.35]But honest to God, there was a lot of money that came in.
[180:16.17]Yeah.
[180:17.85]There was like three or four other people that gave $50 to 100 subs.
[180:19.59]It was fucking crazy.
[180:20.91]I wonder what happens.
[180:24.00]was almost a thousand subs brought in during that whole debacle uninstall the old one how do you uninstall the old patch isn't it like to hook into can I just remove the exe here and that'll be fine
[180:40.36]Remove the... What am I talking about?
[180:41.84]Yeah.
[180:43.86]If you didn't believe that technical difficulties were going to happen, it happened right now.
[180:48.68]I have a backup of everything, but that doesn't include the... Yeah, that's absolutely... No, this is a full-on bingo.
[180:57.10]Without any fucking around.
[180:59.64]I'm going to copy this profile and move it over here.
[181:02.44]I'm going to try this patch.
[181:07.87]Profile.
[181:09.17]Paste.
[181:11.10]Replace this file.
[181:12.94]Do more just for fun?
[181:14.24]Yeah.
[181:15.14]We don't need the bingo anymore.
[181:17.08]Gore patch 3.5.
[181:18.18]I'm just going to start skipping around.
[181:24.34]Congratulations to those that got the community subs, and congratulations to me for just paying myself money and giving a bunch of it to Twitch.
[181:34.67]We are going to turn off the... You can eat a lot of it and not really feel that guilty, but it's high in fat.
[181:41.26]Just be careful.
[181:41.92]Don't go crazy.
[181:45.22]What is what?
[181:45.76]Because you don't want to cause a stomach problem or a digestive issue for yourself if you're just like, I'm going to eat a jar of peanut butter every day.
[181:52.93]No, peanut butter is good for you.
[181:54.81]High quality proteins, especially after you fucking work out.
[182:02.18]This is the Africa story.
[182:03.64]I used to just do a spoonful of tahini before bed.
[182:06.40]Yeah, okay, next.
[182:08.28]This is not going to fit in a priority box.
[182:12.90]This will not fit in a box.
[182:14.24]It's massive.
[182:19.96]Destroy all humans.
[182:25.01]He's going to get a PUBG win.
[182:29.47]That was your last veto.
[182:32.56]I'm already, like, dead.
[182:33.32]What?
[182:34.86]No, the game is over.
[182:35.68]You won.
[182:36.72]You guys won the game.
[182:39.04]Can you buy the dough?
[182:39.64]Dreamcast is coming with me.
[182:42.00]This is pretty Vegas.
[182:42.62]All this random stuff is coming with me.
[182:44.52]A junk company is just coming to take care of all the stuff that I can't take with me.
[182:54.02]I didn't say Vegas.
[182:54.98]I can't extract these guys.
[182:58.35]I don't have that yet.
[182:59.68]I didn't talk about Vegas.
[183:00.62]I said it's not coming with me.
[183:02.84]With me where?
[183:06.18]Didn't we calculate this on stream?
[183:08.68]We did the dimensions of the thing and it said I couldn't ship it.
[183:12.16]I had to get special treatment.
[183:18.36]That's not a requirement, asshat.
[183:20.80]We already looked at this on stream.
[183:23.53]I remember we were sitting there looking at pricing for stuff.
[183:31.59]It was a shitload of money.
[183:36.64]He's gonna say it was 400 pounds.
[183:38.00]200 or 400, doesn't matter.
[183:40.84]I'm talking about shipping my computer with the United Postal Savers.
[183:49.71]No, I need to transmog these.
[183:50.59]Leave them.
[184:00.56]No, it's not worth the anal promo to these guys right now.
[184:02.46]You're supposed to save her.
[184:08.97]Next!
[184:10.45]Dude, why are you continuing to throw rocks at my house?
[184:14.43]I thought we were over that!
[184:20.51]I wish I could pause this, but I can't.
[184:23.11]The last Simpsons hit and run thing that we saw...
[184:26.65]I was talking about people throwing rocks at my house.
[184:29.71]This is four and a half hours later.
[184:32.51]I'm so unfulfilled!
[184:37.56]What's the fastest way to lose?
[184:39.88]Drive into the ocean?
[184:40.60]Nothing lasts forever.
[184:50.03]It was just this level for two hours.
[184:51.72]You gotta be kidding me.
[184:56.60]Just drive to the- just like, go to the power plant, I guess.
[185:01.90]Yeah, this is endgame here.
[185:02.82]Start of this mission has a 20 second timer.
[185:04.28]Yeah, this is the final mission of the game.
[185:06.64]Just exit the car in the beginning of the mission.
[185:08.64]Oh, I forgot my mission.
[185:14.35]It might be faster to just beat the missions.
[185:21.31]Same joke as last week.
[185:22.99]I was done.
[185:25.14]It was so close.
[185:26.90]Oh.
[185:30.00]Just wait the 20 seconds?
[185:33.38]I sound so done.
[185:33.97]Hour number 10.
[185:47.02]I remember being at hour number 10 or 11, and we got a big raid that came in.
[185:51.22]And I was exhausted.
[185:52.60]And I was fucking furious.
[185:55.14]And I remember we got a huge raid.
[185:57.34]And I had to, like, prop myself up and be like, Hey, everybody, welcome to the raid!
[186:01.93]Hi, thank you!
[186:05.37]I can't just, like, fuck it up?
[186:08.21]Where are we going?
[186:13.79]Fucking L.A.
[186:14.52]Why is L.A.
[186:15.12]tomorrow again?
[186:15.86]Where's the crime scene?
[186:17.79]This is part four of L.A.
[186:19.21]Noire.
[186:22.43]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[186:23.15]That's right.
[186:23.45]That's right.
[186:23.87]That's right.
[186:24.63]In the fountain, we shall shine.
[186:27.74]No.
[186:28.16]That'll get rising revenge.
[186:29.54]No.
[186:30.00]This is all over the place.
[186:31.02]What are you guys doing?
[186:33.82]This changes what is happening right now.
[186:37.00]As you click maps.
[186:41.04]How is this even possible?
[186:44.07]37, 36, 39, 32, 36, 31, 36, 34.
[186:45.55]What?
[186:46.61]This doesn't make any sense.
[186:53.80]Oh, I know what's happening.
[186:54.68]Nevermind.
[186:55.00]Everyone, people are clicking on both because 12, 15,000 people have clicked the screen.
[187:01.30]Okay.
[187:01.58]Well, I need to change that.
[187:10.13]one click per user arc go that's the exact same yeah until they fix some more bugs would be nice as well
[187:18.53]Alright, well, how long have we been streaming for?
[187:21.77]Like two and a half hours, something like that?
[187:23.87]Yeah, about two hours or so.
[187:25.16]Nothing.
[187:27.48]Is there anything else you'd like to do, my friend?
[187:32.06]It's all up to you.
[187:33.88]Do you have another game you'd like to play?
[187:36.24]I mean, we could hop into something like GTA if you wanted to for like an hour or something.
[187:43.05]I can certainly try it out, but my CPU is on fire.
[187:46.03]Oh, it's been two hours, so... Yeah.
[187:47.31]Ugh, 2000, uh... If your CPU needs a break or something, just let me know.
[187:51.30]2017, 2016, Jerma.
[187:52.74]Ugh, a two-hour stream.
[187:53.90]It's been enough for me.
[187:54.72]Alright.
[187:55.72]Well, yeah.
[187:56.24]That's it for this particular stream.
[187:58.30]I'm gonna take a pee break.
[187:59.32]I'll be right back.
[188:00.06]Oh, if you're turning off your stream, then I'll turn off my stream.
[188:01.92]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[188:02.26]I mean, like, this, like, particular game.
[188:05.28]That's what I said I didn't make it fucking clear enough to me I'm gonna pee I'll be right back just enjoy the fucking random bullshit that you see I'll be right back
[188:33.92]Okay, how many players do we have?
[188:36.72]I'm having so much fun right now.
[188:37.86]This is perfect.
[188:42.82]Oh, that's great.
[188:45.98]Okay, here we go.
[188:47.84]I'm having a blast right now.
[188:49.06]I really am.
[188:49.48]This is fucking fun.
[188:51.09]Alright then, let's play.
[188:57.36]Oh, my head hurts from just laughing internally right there.
[189:00.64]God, the receptionist part of the wedding.
[189:02.83]I did better at this game than at elementary school.
[189:06.95]Alright, no more fucking jokes.
[189:08.31]No more messing around.
[189:08.91]We're going to play.
[189:10.09]An action that worsens an already bad situation.
[189:12.79]Add insult to injury.
[189:16.85]Oh man, that's so fucking funny.
[189:20.24]Laughing internally.
[189:23.48]Laughing internally.
[189:28.44]They're gonna run out of $100 questions.
[189:33.69]They're gonna run out of the $100 questions.
[189:36.45]Add insult to rights.
[189:39.11]Okay, come on.
[189:41.11]Give me the $32,000.
[189:41.51]I got my lifelines.
[189:49.99]It's beautiful when you see the love of your life coming down the aisle.
[189:53.57]According to a well-known proverb, what do many hands make?
[189:58.65]Many hands, but... I ain't doing it.
[190:08.36]No, it ain't happening.
[190:10.88]Smosh did it.
[190:11.88]I'm not... I don't care if Smosh did this.
[190:20.79]Smosh... I don't... I haven't watched Smosh since they did that Pokemon video like nine years ago.
[190:28.35]Alright, what do I do with these two tabs?
[190:30.77]Sweetheart, I know you're watching right now.
[190:32.82]I'm working on two tabs.
[190:35.72]Can't get waxed.
[190:36.98]Not gonna happen.
[190:38.64]Hey, sweetie.
[190:41.44]Not gonna happen.
[190:44.94]Alright, time to connect the arms.
[190:51.59]Wait, what's happening?
[190:52.35]Hold on.
[190:55.23]Connect the arms and the orange strings.
[190:59.28]Thread them properly.
[191:02.28]Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R symbol on it and tie it to the arm.
[191:09.21]Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R symbol on it.
[191:15.57]Like this fucking guy.
[191:16.81]All right, hold on.
[191:17.61]What'd I miss?
[191:18.29]Hold on, hold on.
[191:18.99]Hold on.
[191:22.43]He's so handsome.
[191:23.29]What happened?
[191:23.79]What are you talking about?
[191:30.01]All right.
[191:30.79]R. Drunk.
[191:32.17]Sweaty.
[191:32.55]R. Where the fuck is this going?
[191:38.72]Wait, what?
[191:39.30]R hand.
[191:41.04]Drunk.
[191:42.70]God damn it.
[191:43.64]Hold on.
[191:48.51]Who the fuck is out there?
[191:49.85]Hey, somebody.
[191:50.51]Hey.
[191:51.73]Somebody out there?
[191:54.29]Fucking weirdo.
[191:55.99]Mosquito in here.
[191:58.82]Holy shit, that was a fucking pog moment.
[192:01.60]Holy shit, that was unbelievable.
[192:06.79]Imagine being that quick.
[192:07.77]That was it?
[192:12.37]No, the first VR we've seen all night.
[192:14.49]Thank you, Walt Disney.
[192:17.33]Alright, let's... What do you mean it's locked?
[192:24.05]Hit.
[192:30.35]Fuck.
[192:35.54]It's too quiet?
[192:36.30]I'll get it.
[192:36.70]Hold on.
[192:37.24]I need to replace this with something, obviously.
[192:41.24]Gonna have to come back later.
[192:42.64]Any other doors?
[192:49.23]This is so... I'm having a blast.
[192:52.01]This is so fucking fun.
[192:54.75]Coin?
[192:56.59]Everybody thank Lazy Luke.
[192:59.74]for making this possible on a stupid whim of shit that we were talking about literally not even a day ago in the pre-stream chat.
[193:10.71]I made a reference to this not even a full day ago.
[193:14.67]And this shit is ready to be used.
[193:17.57]Now.
[193:18.07]Not even a full day later.
[193:19.35]That's un-fucking-believable.
[193:23.35]No problems.
[193:24.43]It worked like a fucking charm.
[193:25.80]Like, it's been great.
[193:26.84]It's been absolutely fucking fantastic.
[193:29.05]I have to, like, make this coin do something on the wall over there?
[193:34.15]I'm going to assume I don't know what that is.
[193:35.67]By the way, if you feel like it, you can do this too.
[193:40.32]This is available for anyone just to play with.
[193:42.12]We'll figure that out later.
[193:43.24]I mean, obviously, you'd just be watching old streams and videos.
[193:47.06]But, it is available.
[193:48.61]You can play with it yourself.
[193:51.65]Skyhunter.
[194:00.67]I'm actually going to take a second just because there's a lot of people here that probably didn't see this in the beginning.
[194:07.39]Let me just go ahead and do this real quick.
[194:10.05]There's a lot of people that weren't here in the beginning.
[194:13.80]Can I at least get some tuna fish next time?
[194:16.02]Remember that.
[194:16.34]Write that down.
[194:17.30]That's a map.
[194:22.27]Okay.
[194:23.31]So, if you're curious how this all works...
[194:28.31]So this website is it's jerma.org slash random.
[194:34.54]This is my entire life on the internet.
[194:37.06]So this is probably like 90% of everything I've ever done.
[194:41.76]If you click this button, you're going to pull from 778 streams and 712 videos.
[194:46.46]So just for the people that weren't here before.
[194:58.76]Now I know that some people that are just trickling in and just like, yeah, why the fuck would I want to skip through 3,200 hours of your fucking shitty stream?
[195:08.29]You don't have to.
[195:08.79]I'm just, the website is available for anybody to use.
[195:13.25]Let's see another shitty stream.
[195:18.81]Get out quick.
[195:20.81]Oh, I'm stuck.
[195:21.78]No, get back in.
[195:33.00]Get in!
[195:38.78]Someone gifted me a sub?
[195:40.12]A lot of gift subs.
[195:41.28]It was probably me!
[195:42.58]Hey.
[195:44.30]It was probably me.
[195:47.40]What?
[195:47.62]Uh, you will not have the countdown, no, because this is a special thing made for the stream.
[195:55.81]So, you can watch as long as you want.
[195:59.01]That was house 106.
[196:00.29]And you can just skip whenever the fuck you want.
[196:02.63]Pick another spot.
[196:04.39]Oh, 700,000 games.
[196:05.35]That's a pretty good one.
[196:08.73]Fuck it.
[196:08.99]Let's go again.
[196:11.89]Super Mario Maker.
[196:15.91]Pretty good job.
[196:16.39]I just won.
[196:16.79]Is that longer than seven seconds?
[196:28.99]This is the McChicken stream?
[196:30.69]Well, this is... It's a nine hour stream, so... When are we gonna get Jerma's family dinner?
[196:36.79]Oh, did you just get it?
[196:41.65]Lightning round?
[196:42.64]No!
[196:43.02]Okay.
[196:44.24]We're probably gonna pull it back.
[196:45.80]This is probably gonna be the end of the stream.
[196:47.80]Um... Just wanted to do something fun today.
[196:51.50]Just experiment with some stuff.
[196:54.52]We're gonna do a lightning round.
[196:57.43]I will see you guys tomorrow for Community Content Night.
[197:01.03]And it's happening tomorrow.
[197:04.14]So, it's time for a lightning round.
[197:07.66]That has to be pretty close.
[197:08.58]Every five seconds we're gonna press the button.
[197:09.78]Here we go.
[197:13.52]Monster Hunter 3.
[197:18.50]I need to kill these things anyways, so... This is old.
[197:20.42]Not a big deal.
[197:21.26]I think Kim is... This is the first time Kim ever showed up on video.
[197:28.26]yeah this is this is a kim appearance the first time ever whatever amid evil part two you guys have to keep linkin ship from my birthday is it my birthday when the did I play this wasn't this like two months ago
[197:57.35]I don't have a single memory of playing this.
[198:05.12]I never played this.
[198:05.86]I don't have a memory of playing this.
[198:07.18]I didn't.
[198:07.52]I've never played this.
[198:11.86]When did I play this?
[198:16.00]I've never played this game.
[198:17.83]When did I play this?
[198:21.53]Uh, wasn't there a chest that I couldn't open?
[198:28.63]Is there anything else I could buy?
[198:29.61]This is freaking me out.
[198:30.95]I don't remember ever opening this.
[198:33.50]I'm not sure I'll give it a go.
[198:34.42]Why not?
[198:35.54]At least just once?
[198:36.32]Is that it?
[198:38.69]What a monster.
[198:47.68]This actually might mess me up because it's gonna be bouncing all over the place.
[198:51.26]See how much damage it does.
[198:52.14]2016.
[198:52.94]Oh, hello.
[198:53.36]Let's go.
[198:54.24]Uh, let's upgrade some stuff.
[198:57.06]Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[198:58.10]This is the best scene that I can make.
[199:07.46]Worst stream?
[199:08.34]What?
[199:08.46]You're bringing in so many people.
[199:09.67]I'm just spending so much money.
[199:11.03]This was not the worst stream of last year.
[199:12.63]I've got so many people.
[199:14.51]I'm going to win.
[199:15.09]Not even close.
[199:17.50]The turtle wins the race.
[199:19.90]Did you see the end of that movie?
[199:21.18]Oh, I love this game.
[199:26.38]Condemned 2.
[199:31.15]What font is the Bandicam font?
[199:34.17]Oh, wow.
[199:35.79]We landed on not only... Unregistered Hypercam.
[199:40.55]Holy shit.
[199:41.33]What a thing to land on.
[199:44.72]Yeah, that's better.
[199:45.94]That's much better.
[199:47.61]Unregistered hypercam.
[199:49.35]This is five times funnier.
[199:52.61]Don't skip.
[199:53.45]I won't.
[199:54.25]It's going to skip in a minute.
[199:57.99]Stop the timer.
[199:58.81]I can't stop the timer.
[200:03.67]It's going to be down a little bit.
[200:06.05]Extended?
[200:07.57]I can't... Alright, somebody extend it.
[200:09.27]Somebody extend it.
[200:12.63]Okay, I'm ready.
[200:14.75]Alright, that's good.
[200:17.65]There it is.
[200:19.03]Okay, we're having fun on our gameplay coming up.
[200:23.52]It's so loud.
[200:37.29]I honestly don't know what's going on.
[200:44.18]What does it actually say?
[200:45.76]Dot net.
[200:50.32]Unregistered hypercam dot net.
[200:53.85]Unregistered.
[200:54.61]Okay, the cam is capital.
[200:56.59]Unregistered hypercam 2.
[201:06.79]And it's got like a weird text to it.
[201:09.31]And it's black.
[201:12.05]This should be put in the Library of Congress.
[201:13.95]I don't know about that.
[201:16.09]This is staying on for the remainder of the stream.
[201:18.21]I hope you guys are aware of this.
[201:25.47]It looks a little, like, glitchy, right?
[201:29.23]Just put the picture at the top.
[201:30.65]That's true.
[201:31.21]I could just do that.
[201:33.85]This belongs in a museum.
[201:37.18]This is for cultural significance.
[201:41.68]You guys are fucking crazy.
[201:53.13]It's gotta be perfect.
[201:57.71]Alright, let's play.
[202:02.53]Turn down the stream resolution.
[202:08.40]I don't... I...
[202:10.01]This joke is a funny joke if it wasn't real, because it's actually real.
[202:20.34]Somebody said imagine if we had just stopped watching the Nancy Drew stream, like not even an hour ago.
[202:29.33]Oh, this would have been the worst stream of 2020.
[202:30.53]That could cause a problem.
[202:32.97]If I didn't veto that, this would have been the worst stream of 2020 for sure.
[202:36.25]Tell me what happens here.
[202:40.41]How does this sound?
[202:45.84]Does this sound fucked up?
[202:47.96]Are we losing quality?
[202:53.96]I thought about it.
[202:55.82]It floated around in my brain for a little while.
[202:57.80]How does that sound?
[202:58.74]To let it play out for an hour and 40 minutes.
[203:00.95]How's this?
[203:07.11]Okay.
[203:07.25]Okay.
[203:13.99]Like that.
[203:16.05]Remove my pop filter, too.
[203:17.39]Okay, hold on.
[203:19.92]I need a fan on the background, too.
[203:21.62]Alright, let's do... How about this?
[203:26.62]I don't even know what this is going to do.
[203:27.98]Imagine if I played a video game.
[203:31.70]What is this going to do?
[203:33.51]I don't know.
[203:35.48]Half of these clips we stop in are just... I don't know what any of them mean.
[203:39.35]Not even playing a video game.
[203:41.33]I gotta remember where these were.
[203:47.55]Oh, guys, no, I have a much better idea.
[203:53.56]We're turning on the webcam audio.
[203:56.78]That's some gross hair.
[204:00.66]People talk shit about the hair I have now.
[204:02.16]No, I can't.
[204:02.70]Really?
[204:03.10]I can't pull it in.
[204:05.06]Three 2017 hair was way grosser than this.
[204:07.97]How does it sound now?
[204:09.77]Pretty terrible.
[204:10.11]That's some gross hair.
[204:13.51]Wait, I might be able to.
[204:17.35]I actually think I can.
[204:18.17]Let's see.
[204:19.05]There's awful lighting.
[204:19.91]Properties.
[204:20.83]Devices.
[204:21.07]I still have awful lighting.
[204:26.62]How's this, guys?
[204:29.86]Hey.
[204:30.16]Hey, everybody.
[204:32.56]Yeah.
[204:35.44]Make the quality of the camera terrible too.
[204:37.01]Okay.
[204:38.25]So I did this video, I'm gonna show you just my new favorite game that I played.
[204:47.33]Let's make the camera look terrible.
[204:55.10]Didn't I one day... One day wasn't there a scenario where I had my webcam mic plugged in and I didn't know for like two hours or something?
[205:05.96]We can do custom resolution.
[205:07.09]We're going to change that.
[205:07.91]When was that?
[205:08.93]That was recently, right?
[205:10.71]Oh dear.
[205:14.13]Kiss him.
[205:17.41]I don't know where it went.
[205:19.27]I'm not going to kiss him.
[205:21.06]Where did it go?
[205:23.35]looks so awful on my screen but it disappeared because it's 160 by 90. where is it pretend to be the mom where's the camera it's gone there is no mom is upstairs and you can't hear
[205:54.17]Hold on, let me see if I can... Almost there.
[206:00.07]Let me see something real quick.
[206:06.03]So, if I do this, if I go like this, is that possible?
[206:11.06]Okay.
[206:13.62]Honey?
[206:13.94]Honey?
[206:14.98]Okay, honey, it's time to come downstairs.
[206:18.34]Come downstairs, right now.
[206:24.12]Okay.
[206:25.72]Hold on.
[206:27.06]There's a couple more things we can do.
[206:30.02]We're going to sharpen the fuck out of this.
[206:31.82]Are you still playing that game?
[206:33.66]It's time for dinner.
[206:37.50]Add an echo?
[206:39.35]Are you?
[206:40.93]Are you still playing that game downstairs?
[206:42.67]This looks like I'm from fucking 1930.
[206:46.67]Is he in a fucking cave?
[206:48.81]And we're going to put a long con on here.
[206:50.45]I'm going to make it look like I'm a fucking terrible streamer.
[206:53.39]It's time for dinner.
[206:57.21]Fucking ghost mob.
[206:59.33]One more thing.
[207:08.93]Get upstairs.
[207:10.47]Put up the saturation like fucking crazy.
[207:12.07]Are you streaming?
[207:15.59]God, I'm going to tell your father about this.
[207:18.75]That's good.
[207:21.57]That's too high.
[207:23.21]Are you?
[207:23.81]Are you?
[207:24.51]Are you?
[207:25.17]Are you?
[207:25.89]Are you streaming?
[207:28.17]Are you?
[207:28.51]How's that?
[207:29.39]Is that a fight?
[207:30.33]Is that fine?
[207:31.21]That's too good.
[207:32.59]I know.
[207:32.89]It is pretty good.
[207:33.72]Thanks, Jeremy.
[207:41.02]Wow.
[207:42.78]No, that's obvious.
[207:43.94]That's too obvious.
[207:52.15]And I gotta be in the wrong spot.
[207:56.63]Rick, somebody extend it.
[207:59.03]Down here?
[207:59.45]Extend it a few minutes.
[208:01.15]Extend it a few minutes.
[208:02.71]And I'm gonna be, like, fucking silent.
[208:04.19]My webcam's gonna be in a wicked embarrassing place.
[208:06.33]Like... Alright, we're good.
[208:15.90]Down here.
[208:19.16]Like that?
[208:22.09]Hey, what are you doing?
[208:24.03]That's good, man.
[208:24.81]When are you coming upstairs?
[208:27.49]I gotta get into my acting mode.
[208:29.71]It's desynced.
[208:31.95]Shit, this looks so fucking bad.
[208:34.73]You have homework to do.
[208:35.63]When are you coming upstairs?
[208:41.30]Hold on, let me move this.
[208:53.97]Remember, like, everybody needs to fucking be in on this, because I need some... People are going to trickle in randomly, and I have to be, like, a piece of shit.
[209:01.63]You know what I mean?
[209:04.07]Okay, that's fine.
[209:07.45]Just going to add one more thing.
[209:13.31]It's so funny, because people were... This needs to be... People were writing, like, your stream sucks and shit like that.
[209:20.12]Like, fuck you, dude.
[209:21.16]Wait, maybe I can.
[209:22.06]Yes, I can.
[209:22.86]Can I?
[209:24.21]Oh, fuck, dude.
[209:25.59]Oh, my God.
[209:26.49]It's about to get so much worse.
[209:29.75]I'm apologizing in advance.
[209:34.47]This is going to look fucking terrible.
[209:36.53]I'm going to fuck up the footage, too.
[209:37.85]A lot of people were in on it.
[209:39.28]And the gunners?
[209:41.18]Good call.
[209:50.96]Because, like, if you came to this stream that was this one, this person is viewbotting, right?
[209:57.89]If they were, like, at this point, this is, like, two or three years ago, something like that.
[210:02.47]There was probably, what, 1,500, 2,000 people watching this stream?
[210:06.05]Like, you're a viewbotting fuck.
[210:08.25]We need to pass it through one more time.
[210:09.39]You are a viewbotter if you have a stream like this that has, like, 3,000 people on it.
[210:15.83]Right?
[210:16.03]Like, there's no way.
[210:17.65]You don't have an unregistered Hypercam 2 stream.
[210:19.17]I'm going to sharpen it.
[210:24.18]Holy shit, this looks- look at this.
[210:25.46]Look, you can even see it.
[210:26.38]You can see, like, the pixels moving.
[210:28.12]Imagine how angry you'd be if you came to this stream.
[210:36.67]And you saw that this guy had, like, 140p quality.
[210:37.91]And he was just, like, blowing his nose and shit.
[210:51.26]I thought this was real.
[210:52.22]I'm serious.
[210:52.84]Was this one of your first streams?
[210:55.23]That makes me so happy.
[211:01.39]By the way, this is like irreversible.
[211:11.24]Quick, extend it.
[211:12.08]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[211:14.08]Extend it one more time.
[211:15.14]Extend it one more time.
[211:16.72]Extend it.
[211:20.47]Some of you guys have a shitload of shit.
[211:21.79]Turn off the light.
[211:22.59]Yep, you've got to be sitting in a dark room, completely empty.
[211:31.78]I'm going to turn these off.
[211:32.94]At least low enough where it looks really fucking creepy and I don't know what I'm doing.
[211:38.66]And then we're going to play.
[211:39.64]You guys need to be in on this because somebody eventually is going to come to the stream and be like, what the fuck is going on here?
[211:48.49]Why does this guy have any viewers?
[211:51.02]See, I told you.
[211:55.84]I look like a fucking serial killer, okay?
[211:58.98]Did everyone pretend to be bots?
[212:10.73]Bot messages.
[212:11.93]How's that?
[212:12.95]Oh, wow, man.
[212:13.91]Cool kill.
[212:15.31]This is such a fun, epic stream.
[212:17.31]Smiley face.
[212:22.51]Same joke.
[212:23.05]No, that was somebody in chat that said that.
[212:25.01]I'm laughing at a chat joke from like three years ago.
[212:27.26]I don't know what I did.
[212:35.40]I think I have to go over here.
[212:47.81]No, this guy, yeah.
[212:50.53]Fuck, man.
[213:09.11]Lock him.
[213:22.07]How do I go up there?
[213:46.67]What?
[213:48.84]What are you doing?
[213:49.78]No, I'll go to bed in like an hour.
[213:51.42]It's 2 a.m.
[213:53.44]Yeah.
[213:53.82]Honey.
[213:55.71]Okay.
[213:58.31]I'll be up in like 20 minutes.
[213:59.41]Come upstairs and... Okay.
[214:02.30]Soon.
[214:16.62]I should be right here.
[214:50.69]No!
[214:54.13]That's not what I wanted to do.
[215:27.23]Somebody said it.
[215:28.27]I just like puked.
[215:30.28]Fucking idiot.
[215:51.78]people in the chat right now like pretending that this is happening right now they're like oh pog dude nice shot like what the fuck oh you guys are gonna kill me one day you're gonna kill me one day I'm gonna die on stream one day from something like that
[216:18.60]Of course I take like a sip of fucking water.
[216:20.34]What the fuck am I thinking?
[216:23.08]Is it weird that I don't want to stop doing this?
[216:35.61]Nice shot, man.
[216:36.85]Keep doing it.
[216:37.47]All right.
[216:37.69]I'm going to make a timer for like Siri.
[216:39.03]Siri.
[216:45.82]I took a sip of water and I choked on it.
[216:48.50]I got one more bit I want to do.
[216:51.66]No, no more bits.
[216:52.64]No more bits.
[216:53.34]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[216:55.82]Next.
[216:56.68]Next.
[216:57.16]Right now.
[216:59.26]I can't.
[216:59.72]I can't climb this.
[217:06.70]There are no bricks.
[217:07.52]Is this guy home?
[217:10.55]I don't even know if this guy's home.
[217:14.11]No, veto this one too.
[217:17.32]That's what I get for reading fucking chat during something like that.
[217:21.42]Some of you guys say the funniest fucking shit, I swear to God.
[217:25.46]Skip Terraria?
[217:34.65]Oh, fine.
[217:37.15]That's some of my favorite means of travel.
[217:39.11]I'm glad you're bringing it up.
[217:40.95]Red Dead Online with Vinny.
[217:43.41]But before we do that, I want to also say there's a game called Rust that just implemented hot air balloons.
[217:49.41]Oh, my God.
[217:50.39]Are you serious?
[217:51.53]Yeah, I swear to God.
[217:52.69]So many technical problems with this one.
[217:55.06]All right, give me one second.
[217:56.64]I have to say hello to somebody.
[217:58.28]Somebody just knocked on my door.
[217:59.34]I've got to say hello to them.
[218:00.20]Hold on.
[218:00.90]What?
[218:01.32]Hey, it's you guys!
[218:02.18]It's my stream!
[218:02.98]My stream!
[218:04.08]Chat, I'm half expecting this to be... It's not.
[218:08.69]I just want to say hello.
[218:12.89]Playing Red Dead Online with me.
[218:16.21]That's something simple things make me fucking laugh.
[218:18.17]I swear that.
[218:18.73]Hey, how you doing?
[218:21.80]It's me, Elvis.
[218:23.06]Vinny Vine Sauce.
[218:24.74]Look at my hair.
[218:26.54]That was fucking really good.
[218:29.64]That was really good.
[218:30.64]I had to come back and say that.
[218:32.66]I'm half expecting this to be a skit.
[218:34.38]And you threw me all off.
[218:35.20]I had a fucking clown here.
[218:39.18]Hit that sniper.
[218:40.38]Dude, that sniper is going like this.
[218:42.90]What the hell is your medic doing back here?
[218:48.98]Walk into it.
[218:51.18]Oh, you lucky.
[218:52.44]Rare.
[218:53.40]Very rare.
[218:54.34]Extraordinarily rare.
[218:55.50]So if you're watching this right now, I am currently in North Carolina visiting my sister.
[219:00.52]Some of you old subscribers will know that I do that every now and then.
[219:03.54]I think I went there last time during Thanksgiving.
[219:07.67]What am I talking about?
[219:09.75]I'm in the same room that I was.
[219:11.81]Oh, this must have been a scheduled upload.
[219:15.16]A scheduled upload.
[219:16.20]It was a really good time.
[219:17.46]It's a really beautiful house.
[219:18.36]Really beautiful place down there in North Carolina.
[219:20.86]Oh, before he gets that stupid thing off.
[219:26.05]I was supposed to hit him.
[219:26.75]I don't even tell you the loadout I'm using either.
[219:30.53]I'm using the flare gun.
[219:31.07]My sister doesn't live in North Carolina anymore.
[219:33.43]Regular, just standard flamethrower.
[219:35.50]And the power jack.
[219:38.30]We need to push this point.
[219:39.48]We need to get rid of that sentry.
[219:41.84]Can we take it out?
[219:42.32]Can I get it right now?
[219:43.42]Come on.
[219:43.92]Keep messing with that, Engineer.
[219:45.56]Yes!
[219:47.50]How did I not hit him with that?
[219:50.34]I got him right there.
[219:51.84]I'm not going to say anything, but it's open.
[219:52.94]No!
[219:55.09]Get on Zip Point.
[219:56.93]Hello.
[219:57.31]There you go.
[219:57.95]What's going on, Medic?
[219:58.93]Thank you for the heals.
[220:00.99]Much appreciate.
[220:06.01]Damn it.
[220:06.75]Shouldn't have done that.
[220:09.75]Mr. Winslow.
[220:10.71]I'm getting out of here after this, I think.
[220:13.05]I think I'm done after this one.
[220:15.53]That's not a good thing.
[220:16.77]You can't be AFK, man.
[220:21.33]God, that, like, I drank, water went down into my, like, lungs.
[220:24.90]I just, like, raised in water.
[220:26.74]Spy check.
[220:28.96]What was that lag?
[220:29.80]Worth it.
[220:33.26]Oh!
[220:34.10]Oh!
[220:36.24]Oh, man.
[220:36.96]Dude, that was... Oh, I was just choked.
[220:41.46]Wow.
[220:42.64]I can't believe I actually killed that son of a bitch.
[220:46.72]Get rid of that sentry.
[220:47.62]Come on.
[220:48.18]Yeah, tan him again.
[220:49.06]Do it again.
[220:49.87]Keep messing with that engineer.
[220:51.27]Keep messing with him.
[220:52.49]Yes.
[220:53.59]What?
[220:53.83]Is that a bad word?
[220:54.61]Need some help here.
[220:56.27]This is post.
[220:56.95]Need some help here.
[220:57.89]Look, this is not the Super Meat Boy playthrough.
[220:59.95]Get me out of there.
[221:00.95]Damn it.
[221:01.19]I swore.
[221:02.07]Oh, heavies.
[221:03.81]It's in that cup.
[221:04.91]We gotta get on that point.
[221:07.00]Big time.
[221:09.92]How many sentries are over there?
[221:12.72]I'm gonna go around the left side this time.
[221:17.46]No, no, no.
[221:19.44]Where are you going?
[221:20.24]You're not gonna... This guy's probably gonna kill me.
[221:24.48]No, I'm gonna miss, but that's alright.
[221:26.96]Where is he?
[221:27.50]Where the hell did this guy go?
[221:32.63]I'll find you.
[221:33.59]And when I find you, you're gonna get your face ripped off.
[221:39.02]I'll take it.
[221:39.96]I'll take it.
[221:41.24]How can I not hit the guy that's standing still?
[221:42.86]Am I so red?
[221:44.90]Why are they both doing that?
[221:47.60]Why are they both doing this?
[221:48.90]I'm, like, fucking red.
[221:50.52]How many is it gonna take to kill this son of a... Alright, fine.
[221:57.15]I'll just smash you!
[221:58.27]You wanna get smashed?
[222:03.31]Oh my god, that was terrifying.
[222:12.82]Didn't even need to hit him.
[222:13.76]We're gonna lose!
[222:16.82]Come on.
[222:17.12]I think I look better now.
[222:18.08]Give me those heals.
[222:19.34]Turn around!
[222:20.42]Turn around, man!
[222:23.14]I gotta try and kill that Engineer.
[222:24.48]That's what I wanted.
[222:27.84]Get him.
[222:29.26]Hit him.
[222:30.98]I'm trying to wait for him just to come across the middle.
[222:33.48]It's a different person.
[222:35.02]Oh, this is not good.
[222:35.72]We're so dead.
[222:36.22]This is what happens when you age.
[222:37.70]We're so dead.
[222:38.88]Like seven or eight years.
[222:40.02]Wait, Demoman, go.
[222:42.33]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[222:43.59]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[222:47.95]This is called, uh, aging almost ten years.
[222:49.53]Can I get there in fifteen seconds?
[222:51.80]I don't think I'm gonna be able to get there in fifteen seconds.
[222:54.22]This is seven years ago?
[222:56.42]What was it exactly?
[222:57.14]2011?
[222:57.16]2012?
[222:57.62]What?
[222:59.02]What?
[223:00.64]What on earth?
[223:02.17]2013, maybe?
[223:02.85]Pops?
[223:03.97]I landed on top of that guy's head!
[223:05.99]2012.
[223:08.63]This is eight years ago.
[223:09.79]Oh my god!
[223:11.92]Okay, that's the first time that's ever happened to me.
[223:14.42]Imagine if I had the man-treads on, that guy would have been goomba-stomped.
[223:19.02]It's defense, Dan.
[223:20.31]Let's play a little bit of defense.
[223:23.49]Nice sentry.
[223:24.47]Very good start.
[223:25.67]Sniper.
[223:26.67]Trying to shoot me in my face.
[223:28.91]Was I like a jacked fuck at this point?
[223:31.31]Yeah, I was.
[223:31.81]Maybe he is.
[223:33.57]Look at the shoulder.
[223:34.09]Look at the chest.
[223:35.39]I gotta get behind him.
[223:36.62]If I stood up right now, people would just fucking hug.
[223:38.54]Somebody just come here.
[223:40.77]Two scouts.
[223:42.75]I'll wrap around you.
[223:45.15]Yeah!
[223:46.79]Give me a heal, man.
[223:47.49]I need a heal.
[223:48.93]I need a heal.
[223:50.95]The old germa would beat your ass.
[223:52.33]No, he wouldn't.
[223:53.55]Man, you are a jumpy little freak.
[223:55.31]Because the new germa would run.
[223:56.95]Close him in here.
[223:58.41]Close him in big time.
[223:59.65]No, no, no.
[224:01.17]Don't think that would happen.
[224:01.93]Everybody get blown out.
[224:02.63]This guy's got crits.
[224:05.57]I'm trying to blow people out.
[224:09.31]Oh, run!
[224:13.34]Get him.
[224:14.76]Please.
[224:15.14]Please die.
[224:16.59]We're going to do ten in a row.
[224:17.75]He's still alive.
[224:18.59]Five seconds each.
[224:19.75]Oh.
[224:22.05]No, he died that far, that long after I shot him.
[224:26.71]It's felt like 20 minutes.
[224:28.15]It's a 10 minute video.
[224:30.41]By the way, this is a 10 minute video before doing a 10 minute video people did to game the fucking YouTube ad system.
[224:38.50]So don't look at that and be like, oh, what a dickhead.
[224:40.34]He's got 10 minutes to get like the four ads.
[224:42.60]So this is 2012, dude.
[224:43.86]This is like before ads even fucking existed.
[224:48.11]Any spies?
[224:49.31]Don't think so.
[224:50.77]Medic, that medic is just standing back there.

[226:19.95]That's all I care about.
[226:20.59]No one's even started building this yet.
[226:22.19]Where is everybody?
[226:23.95]This is part two.
[226:24.79]We're not going to see him.
[226:26.13]Somebody build this.

[226:28.03]Yes, we will.
[226:28.51]All right.
[226:29.53]Jeff Keighley.

[226:33.42]You're going to do it, Matt.
[226:35.78]He was captured.
[226:37.14]Oh, no.
[226:37.82]That's right.
[226:38.20]He was being tortured.

[226:48.69]Tokyo Jungle.
[226:49.39]This game was really fun.
[226:51.63]Skip.
[226:53.69]Oblivion Park.
[226:54.03]Congratulations on the first year of law school.
[226:59.25]I'll hit you up eventually if I ever need you.
[227:01.70]You know, right?
[227:02.14]What, am I talking with a lawyer in chat?
[227:03.48]You always gotta have a good lawyer.
[227:06.90]Happiness being spread.
[227:09.10]Tearing entire family apart.
[227:12.96]Oh, shit.
[227:18.36]Don't do it.
[227:19.32]You'll have to apologize if I do it.
[227:21.62]Whatever.
[227:22.16]Oh, I'll do it.
[227:23.10]I'll do it.
[227:25.86]Do it.
[227:26.32]I'm gonna get to the end.
[227:30.78]This game is a really fun game.
[227:32.33]I wish that somebody like a AAA studio would make this game.
[227:35.73]Plus, I keep the levels.
[227:37.39]And add like 5,000 hours to it.
[227:38.71]That's a good thing.
[227:39.25]And I keep the moves.
[227:40.57]Monster Rancher 4.
[227:43.65]Oh my god, that's not good.
[227:49.11]You would play it again?
[227:49.83]I already beat it.
[227:50.77]Damn.
[227:51.03]I beat the whole game.
[227:51.71]Now he's got this stupid thing.
[227:55.79]Skip.
[227:56.71]Okay, mark it.
[227:57.79]Hard Cry 5.
[227:59.77]Okay.
[228:02.46]That's going to be the one.
[228:06.60]Gas station?
[228:09.08]This game is so bad.
[228:10.40]That is.
[228:11.66]You know, we got our fill in this game after about two hours.
[228:15.34]Three hours.
[228:15.70]What's that?
[228:17.86]Excellent.
[228:21.83]What do you mean, wink?
[228:22.47]Winks are not even possible to redeem.
[228:23.81]I want, like, a different rifle.
[228:27.81]Maybe I shouldn't have spent all my money on no fish.
[228:31.71]So I go eat at the buffet at the Golden Corral.
[228:34.97]And when I went yesterday with some other biaz, I got a pile of fried chicken.
[228:38.54]But when I went to go for the smiley face fries, I couldn't find any.
[228:45.80]That's cool.
[228:46.90]Here comes a complaint.
[228:47.76]I kind of want to just try it.
[228:54.77]It's a cool way to switch.
[228:57.95]No complaint.
[228:59.37]That's rare.
[229:00.55]On this game, that's rare.
[229:08.45]But I need to charge.
[229:09.59]Community Isaac mod?
[229:12.13]Antibirth.
[229:12.93]When did I do this?
[229:13.73]I'm going to leave it there for now.
[229:16.35]Who knows what the hell that is.
[229:17.85]I've been around for so long that I did not play this game.
[229:22.29]I did not play this.
[229:23.67]I didn't play this.
[229:25.33]I've been doing this shit for almost 10 years.
[229:27.79]I did not play Antibirth on stream.
[229:30.95]There's no fucking way that I did.
[229:32.27]I want to play this right now.
[229:34.95]I want to play this right now.
[229:44.31]Who cares?
[229:46.25]I love this game.
[229:46.97]Okay, I'm going to make a statement here that a lot of people may disagree with or they might agree with.
[229:52.66]Here's the statement.
[229:54.26]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[229:55.64]You're not going to die right here.
[229:58.04]The Binding of Isaac might be within the top 10 of my favorite games ever made.
[230:03.98]I think it might even be... It could be top 5 of the most fun games I've ever played.
[230:13.00]I make that judgment based on how much time I have in a game.
[230:18.64]I have put so many hours into this game.
[230:22.50]I love this game so much.
[230:23.48]I have probably hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, maybe even a thousand hours in Binding of Isaac.
[230:30.67]You only do that with something that you just love and think is so much fun.
[230:37.68]Should I, like, start this again and play this again?
[230:39.24]I feel like this would be a lot of fun to do.
[230:40.40]And, like, not do it for, like, two hours.
[230:43.54]I actually played this game for, like, six to eight hours in a stream.
[230:53.26]It's career suicide.
[230:55.38]Why?
[230:55.86]What?
[230:56.35]It's Binding of Isaac.
[230:56.99]Everybody loves Binding of Isaac.
[230:58.19]Skip.
[231:07.29]Skip.
[231:13.82]It's streamed in the corner.
[231:18.16]How did we get this again?
[231:19.20]Am I playing this?
[231:24.96]Okay.
[231:28.87]Vampyr.
[231:29.81]Game sucks.
[231:31.70]Sounds pretty good.
[231:32.90]And lastly, spooky things.
[231:36.16]All right.
[231:36.78]Because it's Halloween, right?
[231:39.16]Jeremiah, as this is your show, would you like to kick us off here?
[231:42.80]This is the very beginning.
[231:43.89]You do.
[231:44.59]Just this one time.
[231:47.43]I'll take 17th century poetry for 50, please.
[231:49.71]All right.
[231:50.59]Let's see what we got here.
[231:51.91]Extend.
[231:52.11]Extend.
[231:54.62]John Calvin crafted this Christian ideology stressing God's power... That's the whole thing.
[232:00.36]I'm not gonna watch this whole thing.
[232:01.26]This is like a three and a half hour, four hour stream.
[232:03.72]Uh... Uh, what is, um... You got anything?
[232:12.29]Uh, Doctor Strange?
[232:14.23]Uh, I have no idea.
[232:15.47]And, uh... Sam and Max!
[232:19.41]I put face cam on for this?
[232:21.15]It actually is.
[232:22.78]You are right.
[232:24.00]It is a toy mafioso.
[232:25.78]Why don't we have face cam on for Sam and Mac?
[232:28.40]He will not sneak past me, oh no.
[232:31.28]The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance.
[232:33.66]Got it.
[232:34.50]The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance.
[232:36.82]Whoa, we're not going to do that.
[232:38.62]We're not going to do that.
[232:39.54]That's like a spoiler.
[232:40.32]No, I don't think it's going to happen again.
[232:50.54]This is like the last level.
[232:51.48]There's no way it's going to happen again.
[232:54.45]Alright, two more.
[232:56.49]No, three more.
[232:57.77]And the third one is going to play to zero.
[233:00.45]And that's it.
[233:01.17]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[233:01.77]One.
[233:01.85]Two.
[233:01.95]Three.
[233:19.92]No way, right?
[233:22.10]That's not actually going to happen, is it?
[233:33.52]Now what do I do?
[233:37.08]Okay, that should be enough for now.
[233:38.74]I can't believe this happened.
[233:40.85]It was meant to be the Nintendo Labo.
[233:44.25]Nemo Slack.
[233:44.97]So this goes underneath...
[233:48.25]in here eight and a half hours bye bye bye bye round and then up the hole why am I up there oh slide the end of the string through the eyelet from underneath what the are you doing oh that's right I remember this everyone was talking about like my penis and
[234:14.37]And I put like a trash bag on my pants because people were talking about like dick and stuff, right?
[234:18.27]Like, I remember this.
[234:20.19]No, I remember this.
[234:20.83]Yeah, people were like fucking being... Chat was like all just fucked up tonight.
[234:23.61]Are these slots on the ocean?
[234:26.57]What the fuck?
[234:28.19]Yeah, I put like a plastic bag diaper on because people wouldn't shut up about it.
[234:34.93]I remember this.
[234:36.39]Wrong way?
[234:36.99]What do you mean wrong way?
[234:38.84]That's not the wrong way.
[234:44.67]This is the right way.
[234:45.31]This was so much fun.
[234:48.74]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[234:51.24]We'll hang out and do the bits and subs and everything, but... This is very much a very impromptu stream.
[234:56.98]This is crazy.
[234:58.92]I didn't know I was doing this until... This is going to be an actually functioning fishing rod.
[235:09.73]Thanks for watching.
[235:10.29]Thanks for joining me.
[235:12.30]See, look at the rubber bands.
[235:13.26]Alright, we're going to let it... One more.
[235:15.53]Now I'm going to click it five times in a row.
[235:23.25]...hysterical things that happened in this.
[235:25.33]Like, if you just joined us, you're going to want to watch it tomorrow.
[235:30.25]Alright, it's time for some QWOP.
[235:35.95]So what was my final death count?
[235:40.76]25?
[235:40.90]Wait, does it say?
[235:44.94]No, they've been counting in the stream.
[235:47.14]I'm just glancing over and seeing.
[235:53.01]Alright, thanks a lot for playing, guys.
[235:54.19]If you played, I'll probably do this again.
[235:56.03]This was actually pretty damn fun.
[235:58.57]Thanks for coming, if you joined into the game, into the session.
[236:01.79]So now we're going to play some QWOP, and yeah, thanks so much, guys.
[236:12.68]That was a shot in the face.
[236:14.00]Alright, let me pull up.
[236:17.50]How do I get out of here?
[236:19.85]Alright, it's gonna be a black screen until I get QWOP loaded.
[236:23.00]No way!
[236:24.84]Q-W-O-P.
[236:25.94]QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[236:31.05]Hey, yo.
[236:33.51]I love Liberty City.
[236:34.69]This is ancient.
[236:35.53]This might be one of the oldest things.
[236:37.49]QWOP is a flash game.
[236:41.12]It's a flash game where you have to use QW and then OP to run and it is incredibly difficult.
[236:49.32]Is this the first stream?
[236:50.24]Actually, the screen's probably not going to go black.
[236:52.06]It's probably going to be just my background.
[236:54.12]This has to be one of... Just my desktop background.
[236:57.58]I still have that background.
[237:00.72]Alright, let me pull up some QWOP.
[237:03.88]Let me make sure the stream thing is there.
[237:12.51]People think I'm bullshitting.
[237:13.45]Oh man, that was funny.
[237:14.29]I think I'm bullshitting.
[237:17.25]That was so damn funny.
[237:20.77]Q-W-O-P, QWOP, QWOP, QWOP.
[237:23.97]Remember, that's a lie.
[237:26.89]Is it?
[237:27.75]Why don't you think about this?
[237:30.29]Oh, no, never mind.
[237:30.93]I can't do this joke.
[237:31.45]I gotta think about this.
[237:33.91]I tried to queue it up.
[237:34.63]Good thing we didn't get to see QWOP.
[237:44.74]Cuphead, no.
[237:45.88]Skip.
[237:47.02]Games, skip.

[238:05.37]Alright, so you know when words just come out but they mean abso-fucking-lutely nothing.
[238:11.97]Words were just coming out of my mouth, and they meant nothing.
[238:17.00]It was just word soup.
[238:18.52]It didn't mean anything.
[238:19.50]It wasn't going anywhere.
[238:20.60]It was just a run-on sentence.
[238:38.19]That's the penis music thing.
[238:42.61]That's the penis music.
[238:43.69]Fix the audio desync.
[238:44.63]Hold on.
[238:45.17]What are you talking about?
[238:46.13]Isn't it?
[238:50.03]Hold on.

[239:00.32]What a great thing to end on.
[239:01.08]Game audio.
[239:01.76]That shouldn't be a thing.
[239:05.40]The video has desync.

[240:40.20]I will see you tomorrow if you're taking off.
[240:42.74]If you're sticking around for a little bit, we'll go over some of these things.
[240:45.00]I do the bits and the subs and everything at the end of a stream if you are a new viewer.
[240:52.90]And right now, we're going to talk about it.
[240:56.11]Freddie Dredd, $500.
[240:57.25]Five fucking hundred dollars.
[241:04.05]That was within 10 minutes of the stream starting, which is insane.
[241:10.84]Thank you, Freddie, for your 500 fucking bucks and 100 community subs right after that, which is insane.
[241:21.25]Mitchell, thanks for the thousand bits.
[241:23.67]I wish I had $100 to give you tonight, partially because you're a huge inspiration and awesome content creator, but also for that amazing Mario Kart rant in the first Sunshine VOD.
[241:32.94]I would pay money to listen to you instead of just sitting in a room ripping bad games a new asshole.
[241:41.53]Oh, here comes a new podcast.
[241:46.04]no this is this is a podcast it's everything you know what I mean it could be whatever the we want sometimes the stream just stops and for 20 straight minutes we just talk about random so I don't need to do a podcast because this stream is such an erratic mess that it just happens sometimes anyway but thank you for the 10 bucks
[242:14.41]Blueberry Juice, thanks for 250.
[242:15.86]Jerma Grin, thanks a lot.

[242:39.05]100 people is a lot of people.
[242:39.85]1,000 people is a lot of people.
[242:42.64]That's fine.
[242:43.06]Don't worry.

[243:35.31]It covers gamers.
[243:36.37]Thanks for the 250.
[243:37.19]Hey Jerma, I had a weird dream with you in it last night.
[243:39.33]More dreams?
[243:40.75]You were in a play that was like Clue.
[243:43.28]Where it was a murder mystery, but there was a different murderer every time.
[243:46.88]But it was also competitive.
[243:48.58]So the actors were competing to get to be the murderer.
[243:52.60]I was hanging out with you backstage.
[243:54.65]And you're about to go to be the murderer, but someone else did it first.
[243:58.25]And you got wicked mad.
[243:59.65]Like absolutely seething anger that you got kill stole.
[244:03.25]It was really funny.
[244:07.88]Add it to the list of Jerma is a psychopath in your dreams.
[244:17.41]Hey, Yenwen, thanks a lot for the $2.50.
[244:19.03]They say, hey, Jerma, do you know it's been over a year since I sent you my first piece of artwork?
[244:25.02]Long time.
[244:26.40]It's pretty crazy when I think back on it, especially since that drawing was never intentional.
[244:31.38]It was a random sketch that turned into a fully-fledged painting.
[244:35.49]During the past year, I resigned from being a bartender and have begun training as a teacher.
[244:39.66]I'm really busy and need to go to bed early, so I haven't been able to catch many streams, nor draw anything serious.
[244:47.32]Thanks for joining the stream today, as well as everyone from the pre-stream chat.
[244:49.69]It was a lot of fun.
[244:52.27]Here is the finished image that I was working on.
[244:57.93]Let's put it on screen.
[245:00.46]If you don't know, Yen Wen is an insanely talented artist.
[245:04.97]Some of the most ridiculous paintings we've ever seen have come from Yen Wen.
[245:10.15]I know some people probably have links of some of the insane shit.
[245:18.47]This is, uh, this is, no, look, fucking Dunkin' Donuts, dude.
[245:23.47]How do I save this?
[245:24.97]Am I this dumb?
[245:31.66]I don't know how to save a photo.
[245:33.08]Oh.
[245:34.71]Oh, there we go.
[245:42.29]That was not it.
[245:43.85]Oh, yes, it was.
[245:44.89]Yes, it was.
[245:45.45]It's just very high resolution.
[245:47.11]I was like, wait, it's gray.
[245:48.31]There we go.
[246:04.33]Why does Jex have to be so much bigger than me?
[246:06.91]We're the same size.
[246:07.81]One of them's just smarter in video game knowledge.
[246:15.86]Thanks a lot, Yanwen.
[246:17.62]This is good shit, as always.
[246:23.18]This is a big brother reveal?
[246:28.51]Thank you.
[246:29.03]It means a lot.
[246:33.34]More great artwork.
[246:35.34]From Yen Wen.
[246:39.08]Goiki gave $50, 5000 bits.
[246:41.59]We did it, boys.
[246:42.39]This has me crying.
[246:46.23]Thank you, Goiki.
[246:46.77]I'm not sure exactly what you were referring to.
[246:48.79]But I missed your $50.
[246:50.65]And I want to make sure that I did touch upon it.
[246:55.41]So thank you.
[246:57.98]Hey, Razlik.
[246:58.78]Thanks, Razlik, for the $5.00.
[247:01.53]Derm, I've been rather ill for the past two months.
[247:03.43]Watching your streams and videos helps me out so much.
[247:07.19]On them sleepless nights.
[247:08.59]Thank you and much love to you in this community.
[247:10.96]Such a wonderful place.
[247:12.64]Also, it's my wonderful Scottish friend's birthday today.
[247:16.32]DK.
[247:17.50]If you could wish him a happy birthday, it'd be awesome.
[247:19.90]Hey, DK.
[247:20.46]Have a fucking fantastic birthday.
[247:27.31]Happy birthday, DK.
[247:33.36]Thanks a lot, Razlik.
[247:35.38]Uh, Pifflavor, thanks for the thousand bits.
[247:37.46]Ten dollars.
[247:38.56]Not gonna lie, these streams recently have been very epic.
[247:41.54]In my opinion.
[247:42.88]Thanks for that.
[247:43.28]I don't know if we're... I've laughed this much in a while.
[247:45.92]Also, even though you have so many games on the list, play Dead Space.
[247:49.46]Probably this Halloween.
[247:53.95]This October, I'll probably do at least one or two of the Dead Spaces in a row.
[247:58.29]That's a Halloween stream.
[247:59.19]You know what I mean?
[247:59.85]That's a Halloween time stream.
[248:03.46]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[248:04.76]This stream reminds me of the part in... Uh... It's a spoiler for a movie.
[248:11.15]I'm not going to read it.
[248:11.97]Because I saw spoilers for a movie.
[248:15.07]And I haven't seen that movie, so I'm not going to read it.
[248:21.29]Thanks, Gnarly, for the 250.
[248:22.25]And then...
[248:27.07]We had 500 community subs from MrGerma985, so thanks whoever you are.
[248:36.69]Thanks a lot, Germa.
[248:39.01]What a guy.
[248:39.45]When the stream is over, I'm going to have to go into my PayPal account and turn off and check the fraud department and make sure they know that this is real.
[248:51.55]I'm going to do that right away.
[248:57.23]Uh, but in the middle of that, Goikee gave 20.
[249:00.92]Austin Atlantis gave 100.
[249:01.74]Abe Cashim gave 100.
[249:05.52]So there were 200 community fucking subs that were added to that.
[249:09.02]Besides my little bet bingo with you guys.
[249:11.28]So thanks to Austin and to Abe for giving 200 fucking subs.
[249:16.45]That's a shitload.
[249:17.69]You never expected to give that much money.
[249:20.73]He's gonna charge them back.
[249:21.87]No, I'm not.
[249:23.89]Uh, AveryDropDead gave 500.
[249:26.82]Thank you.
[249:28.96]Robbie Revolver gave a thousand bits.
[249:31.46]$10.
[249:31.50]Jerma, thank you to you and your team for putting this event together.
[249:35.10]It was fun, and this is why we love you.
[249:36.67]Looking forward to more creative events in the future.
[249:38.53]This is... This was just... Lazy Luke just threw this together in not even a day.
[249:48.05]We were jokingly talking about this fucking two days ago, and it was just like, oh, hey, by the way, you can just use it now, and it works flawlessly.
[249:56.96]By the way, flawlessly.
[249:59.26]There was not a single problem.
[250:02.82]Not a single hiccup.
[250:04.09]It's not like, oh, it crashed.
[250:05.31]We reloaded.
[250:07.03]Shit worked fucking flawlessly.
[250:09.73]So, everybody thank Lazy Luke for throwing together just a goofy idea that we had in this pre-stream chat two days ago and made it reality.
[250:20.85]That's who you should be thanking.
[250:27.86]But... Thank you, Captain Nemo, for the 300 bits.
[250:31.60]Jerma, you should see if you can leave the random bot running when stream is offline so the chat and stream can just be bopping constantly.
[250:38.89]Even if you aren't around.
[250:40.85]Well, you guys can just use it.
[250:42.17]It's available at jerma.org slash random.
[250:44.72]You can just play with it right now.
[250:50.16]That's not an exclusive thing to me.
[250:51.64]It just pulls data from YouTube and Twitch and everything, so...
[250:58.62]You can just play with it if you want.
[251:02.73]It's a really neat little tool.
[251:05.45]We are going to put the subs on stream, and it's going to be very, very, very, very ridiculous.
[251:10.33]This is going to be very fast.
[251:11.89]Because... I mean, I stacked the deck a little bit with 500.
[251:17.14]But there was still... No, we're not doing mind show.
[251:23.60]That was the wrong... Sorry, wrong scene.
[251:25.68]Sorry about that.
[251:26.18]We're going this way.
[251:29.86]Although I may have stacked the deck, it still doesn't matter.
[251:34.98]It was fucking hundreds and hundreds of community subs.
[251:41.85]From other people like Freddy Dredd, Abe, there was a thousand fucking subs tonight.
[251:49.71]So let me get the credits rolling.
[251:51.01]This is going to blow by pretty quickly.
[251:56.39]Let's see just how fast this goes.
[251:58.77]I wonder if you build or even read one name.
[252:03.89]In three, two, one, roll them.
[252:06.87]Oh boy.
[252:07.41]Nope.
[252:07.91]Don't think so.
[252:13.58]Thanks guys.
[252:15.96]That's a lot of people.
[252:17.44]That's probably more than a thousand today.
[252:24.16]Jesus.
[252:27.36]We also had... GooberryJuice250, please set it to change every one second, please.
[252:34.28]I'm not sure that it could even handle one second changes.
[252:40.03]What's the sub count now?
[252:42.63]Uh, let's see.
[252:43.79]After tonight, let's see what it is.
[252:47.49]The current sub count right now, after today's insanity, is...
[252:56.02]8500 subs 8581 to be exact after today so take away my 500 which were just you know if you want to talk about stacking a deck so over 8000 which is fucking crazy and still no new emotes
[253:25.96]Terrible.
[253:31.81]But, anyways.
[253:32.99]There's still about four or five bits left to do.
[253:38.07]We have Thick Neck Baby gave 1,500 bits.
[253:41.51]15 bucks.
[253:43.15]No message.
[253:44.69]Just a bunch of money that they just slapped onto the stream.
[253:47.41]Thank you.
[253:50.27]Did we get Mr. Dask?
[253:51.47]Mr. Dask gave $10.
[253:52.71]1,000 bits too.
[253:53.89]No message either.
[253:55.97]Thank you, Mr. Dask.
[253:56.69]I'm glad you think that way.
[253:59.77]I... Thank you.
[254:00.21]Thanks for saying that.
[254:00.99]I... That's all I can say.
[254:01.93]Thanks.
[254:02.09]That's correct.
[254:23.54]If the stream archive was not saving and uploading every single VOD ever, this also doesn't happen.
[254:31.06]So, huge shout out to the stream archive, guys.
[254:35.92]Talking about hundreds.
[254:36.76]Like, 700 fucking uploads.
[254:37.90]750 uploads.
[254:38.26]So thank them, too.
[254:48.12]Uh, Violet Wanderer, $5.
[254:49.92]I've got, like, 700 hours in Binding of Isaac Rebirth.
[254:52.37]It's one of my favorites, too.
[254:54.47]When is... Um... What's the new one coming out?
[254:59.23]Like, Redemption or something?
[255:00.73]It hasn't been a new... Aren't they taking the anti-birth mod and making it a thing?
[255:06.38]They're officially putting it in the game?
[255:10.90]What's it called?
[255:11.44]Like, Repentance or something?
[255:13.48]Yeah, they're adding a final expansion.
[255:15.95]Repentance.
[255:17.51]Well, when that comes... Maybe when that comes out, I'll get back into Binding of Isaac on stream.
[255:24.07]That sounds like a good time to start getting back into it.
[255:27.31]That sounds like a plan.
[255:31.53]Thank you.
[255:32.07]For the five dollars.
[255:34.07]Uh, I pink Karu.

[256:26.97]Thanks for watching the past few months.
