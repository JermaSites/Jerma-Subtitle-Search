[02:07.83]We'll talk about some stuff.
[02:08.79]See you in a sec.
[04:34.80]So I have a funny story for you guys.
[04:38.10]It's a dream I had.
[04:39.32]It's not the Baltcoin dream.
[04:40.52]It's a way, way more serious one.
[04:46.02]You hope I get a vibe soon?
[04:47.42]It's funny you say that.
[04:49.43]Because I'm getting a vibe.
[04:52.71]Really soon.
[04:53.49]I'll have a vibe.
[04:55.81]By the new year.
[04:56.55]For sure.
[04:58.97]So like the first week of January.
[05:00.79]There's a lot of things I want to do.
[05:01.92]There's a lot of shit that's happening like this week.
[05:05.37]in regards to the stream.
[05:06.51]So, we'll find out.
[05:09.13]First of all, uh, let's talk about, very briefly, let's move over to the game.
[05:15.01]Oh, my fucking head.
[05:17.52]We got a lot to go over.
[05:18.38]I haven't seen you guys in like fucking, what, four days?
[05:20.36]When was the last time I streamed?
[05:22.50]Friday?
[05:23.32]Saturday?
[05:24.52]It's been at least like four days.
[05:25.48]Let's catch up a little bit, right?
[05:28.36]I wanna know how you guys are doing.
[05:31.31]I'm doing alright.
[05:33.13]I've been better.
[05:35.43]Oh god, don't press that one.
[05:37.59]Okay, good.
[05:39.79]So tonight, we're gonna play Fire Pro.
[05:41.57]This is an old school game that they've remade.
[05:43.68]I think this game was on Early Access.
[05:45.66]It might be a piece of shit.
[05:47.56]The old ones were kind of interesting.
[05:48.78]There was a lot of different game modes you could make a bunch of people.
[05:53.34]Those of you that know, this is like a Japanese wrestling game.
[05:55.38]It was on the Super Nintendo.
[05:59.81]We can do a couple rumbles.
[06:00.89]There's online play, I guess, so if anybody has this game, maybe we could play it, I guess.
[06:06.55]Maybe somebody makes a room, I don't know.
[06:09.95]But, for the purposes of just starting the stream, let's turn down this fucking music.
[06:18.97]You couldn't get any more anime outro music if you tried.
[06:23.82]You guys can't even hear it.
[06:27.09]There you go.
[06:29.54]I'm one of those people that can't talk when music is playing.
[06:32.50]I have a lot of trouble at parties.
[06:35.66]If you've met me at a party before, I'm kind of hard to talk to.
[06:38.82]Just drop just a fucking zero.
[06:41.63]Alright.
[06:42.87]So.
[06:45.57]First things first.
[06:47.01]I am not feeling well.
[06:48.73]I haven't been feeling well for like the last three or four days.
[06:51.77]It's not like stomach.
[06:52.90]It's not.
[06:53.62]It's my head.
[06:55.32]I've got this really bad, annoying, lingering migraine that hasn't really left.
[06:59.78]And it's like fucking up my mouth.
[07:01.70]It's fucking up my talking.
[07:02.98]It's fucking up my brain.
[07:04.71]It's not cool.
[07:05.35]It sucks.
[07:06.29]But I'm alright now.
[07:07.07]I'm going to be alright.
[07:08.23]But I cannot guarantee you we're going to be going for like more than a couple hours tonight.
[07:12.89]I wish I could.

[15:16.76]No, we need like antlers.
[15:23.06]That's kind of like... That's kind of buggish, I think.
[15:24.88]A little bit.
[15:28.73]No, it's got to be things like antennas.
[15:32.29]Antennae.
[15:33.65]That's how you pronounce it, right?
[15:36.55]We got these.
[15:37.93]Oh, boy.
[15:39.43]They're going to be on the side of the head.
[15:40.57]I was not expecting this much customization, so... I think we found them.
[15:47.54]There we go.
[15:48.04]No, that's just a mustache.
[15:52.14]No.
[15:53.14]No.

[16:32.50]No, no, no.
[16:34.18]They have to exist.
[16:38.68]No, that's not it.
[16:41.60]This would be two straight antennae.
[16:45.96]Close enough.
[16:46.85]Honestly, close enough.
[16:47.69]I'm going to be here all day.

[17:00.49]We've got some antenna.
[17:01.75]Antennae here.
[17:06.18]I gotta make his head a little smaller, I think.
[17:09.80]Uh, these need to be... Hey, this is just gonna be like a straight up, just, just, a straight up ant.
[17:15.12]Alright, where'd he go?
[17:21.52]I gotta, I can't... We have to put eyes on him.

[17:31.25]No, this guy, this sucks.
[17:32.31]I need to like delete his face.
[17:36.57]His head is too big.
[17:38.65]It just is.
[17:39.61]Let's be real about that.
[17:40.51]We don't have big heads.
[17:50.00]Alright, now he's just the iron giant.
[17:52.74]Alright, now it's the iron giant.
[17:55.42]Okay, there we go.
[17:58.58]Now he's just the iron giant.

[18:10.76]What do you mean, have I ever seen an ant?
[18:15.32]Of course I have.
[18:17.40]Now it's the iron giant.
[18:18.29]I don't even know what this is, but we're going to put it on his head.
[18:28.15]It's an ant piloting a mech.
[18:32.27]We're going to have to make like fucking 50 people, aren't we?
[18:36.96]Well, welcome to the, uh, create a character stream, because that's pretty much what this is gonna be.
[18:41.74]There we go.
[18:45.89]It's the iron giant.
[18:46.71]We're gonna get him, like, good, uh... That's fine.
[18:52.93]Oh, fuck.
[18:54.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:55.81]Wrestler appearance.
[18:57.99]I need to put different clothes on him.
[19:00.87]Iron Ant-Man.
[19:02.61]The Iron Ant-Man.
[19:04.87]Part face.
[19:05.55]Here we go.
[19:05.91]Chest.
[19:08.17]Oh, dear.
[19:10.51]Oh, dear.
[19:17.76]Hold on, now he's... This is great.
[19:23.74]What is this?
[19:26.38]He's just a saw blade.
[19:28.70]No, no, we gotta stick with our guns here, you know?
[19:30.76]What can you put on his chest?
[19:38.02]The Iron Giant had a bowtie, right?
[19:42.32]Did he?
[19:42.88]Did he have a bowtie?
[19:44.94]I think he did.
[19:45.64]It was like a blue bowtie.
[19:51.14]Yeah, he had this weird Mickey Mouse-looking blue bowtie.
[19:53.75]And he had something else on his chest, too.
[20:01.39]Yeah, he was wearing a bra.
[20:02.47]No, he didn't have any tattoos.
[20:07.69]He wasn't wearing just, like, a shitty t-shirt.
[20:09.63]Alright, that's good.
[20:12.69]Waist.
[20:14.27]Uh, he didn't have any, like, zero, literally, naked.
[20:18.35]Oh, fuck.
[20:19.25]It has to have clothes on.
[20:21.57]It might be a robotic thing, though.
[20:25.66]Did he have a furnace in his stomach?
[20:27.84]No, that's fine.
[20:28.46]Just make it black.
[20:30.12]Or gray.
[20:30.48]There we go.
[20:35.30]Uh, anything else?
[20:38.26]No.
[20:39.92]No, these are tattoos.
[20:40.72]Okay, waist.
[20:41.40]We got upper arm.
[20:42.77]No, he's fine.
[20:43.47]Feet.
[20:44.15]We just need like robot feet.
[20:50.03]Okay, not barefoot.
[20:52.73]He wasn't a bear.
[20:53.49]He didn't have claws.
[20:55.63]Okay, here we go.
[21:00.29]No, he didn't have defined toes.
[21:02.57]I'm certain of that.
[21:03.19]There we go.
[21:05.46]That looks pretty good.
[21:09.47]No, he didn't have, like, Zoom shoes on.
[21:13.45]Yeah, these are fine.
[21:15.63]There we go.
[21:16.41]Make them bright color.
[21:20.19]And... He didn't... He had, like, little designs.
[21:24.63]No, he didn't.
[21:25.91]No, he was just wearing, like, socks.
[21:27.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:28.47]Don't fuck this up.
[21:30.27]There he is.
[21:30.95]Now, he has to be giant.
[21:31.83]Size?
[21:32.69]Giant.
[21:35.31]There is the Iron Giant.
[21:36.43]There's our first character.
[21:38.87]He's going to be a mixed up style strong.
[21:43.11]We're going to do strong.
[21:45.89]There he is.
[21:46.25]I think we can confirm that.
[21:51.25]We're going to have to change his name to the Iron Giant.
[21:58.00]I don't know what his real name was.
[22:00.08]No, it's just Iron Giant.
[22:06.61]Iron... We'll put a little subtle humor in here because of what it was supposed to be.
[22:10.35]You know what I'm saying?
[22:14.41]Like, you know... Do you understand what I'm saying here?
[22:16.23]Like, this is supposed to be an ant.
[22:17.23]This is the iron giant.

[34:41.54]Where's, like, the guy with no face?
[34:44.64]I'm deleting everything else.

[34:53.81]Invisible man.

[34:59.18]Let's just go to zero with everything.
[35:00.59]Hey, Etalyx is fine.
[35:08.57]He didn't get hit by a bus.
[35:11.07]Don't listen to him.
[35:16.98]Let's make his face tiny.
[35:18.84]Delete this wrestler?
[35:19.64]No.
[35:19.98]The invisible man is going to win the Rumble.
[35:25.81]There we go.
[35:26.23]Hands.
[35:30.86]There we are.
[35:33.06]Just give him these white gloves.
[35:36.64]Hands.
[35:39.74]Those are fine.
[35:40.71]There we go.
[35:41.13]You can give him just big puffballs.
[35:47.43]No, default hands are fine.
[35:48.67]Let's get rid of everything else.
[35:54.75]The noise is driving me crazy.

[35:58.68]Solved that problem real quick, didn't I?
[36:05.91]There we are.
[36:08.13]Take his thighs down.
[36:09.07]His calf size.
[36:17.74]I can't believe you can actually do this.
[36:22.84]Should he have shoes?
[36:23.64]He would have shoes too, wouldn't he?
[36:24.98]No.
[36:25.16]If it's the typical invisible man gag.
[36:29.15]He just would be bare gloves.
[36:31.43]Which means it's a guy with gloves on just naked.
[36:33.61]Alright, let's see.
[36:35.46]Yep, there it is.
[36:36.96]Or it's invisible man or his master hand.
[36:42.52]Keep the feet?
[36:47.94]Should he have just like feet and underwear?
[36:50.14]Alright, fine.
[36:51.03]He has feet.
[36:54.33]It's just the invisible man.
[36:55.47]There he is.
[36:56.17]Don't do anything else.
[36:57.11]Confirm.
[36:58.51]He's done.
[37:01.52]Dan McCarthy, the invisible man.
[37:03.78]Let's just make him a shit character.
[37:06.80]Let's just make the hamburger helper.
[37:09.60]No feet?
[37:22.57]Feet on?
[37:25.59]Give him a voice.
[37:26.67]Alright, we're getting a lot.
[37:29.53]I'm seeing a lot of no feet here.
[37:34.35]I'm seeing a lot of, like, no feet.
[37:45.28]Alright.
[37:46.70]Alright.
[37:47.48]The feet are staying.
[37:48.32]The feet are staying.
[37:52.54]No, you don't.
[37:52.94]Fuck it.
[37:53.20]The feet are gone.
[37:53.66]The feet are gone.
[37:57.28]The feet are gone.
[37:58.42]I've made my decision.
[38:05.20]Decision is final.
[38:09.26]Okay, who cares what this guy's moves are because you're not gonna even know what the fuck they are.
[38:12.66]I don't even know what these are.
[38:21.00]That's fine.
[38:25.46]Okay, fuck everything else because nobody cares.
[38:27.63]His charisma is gonna be an S because he's- no, it's gonna be like a C. Give him like a B. Give him a B in everything.
[38:35.84]You guys realize that when these guys when people are fighting in the ring This is going to be the most annoying thing you're ever gonna hear We're gonna have to go back and delete all these voice lines.
[38:57.79]So I'm only gonna give it to like a handful of people You will not be able
[39:04.28]You won't be able to even fucking watch this stream.
[39:07.56]If this is the case.
[39:09.50]You understand?
[39:13.60]It's gonna be loud.
[39:14.80]But, you know, who cares?
[39:15.86]Oh, yeah, why?
[39:16.99]In case there's an invisible man versus an invisible man.
[39:20.93]I think we should just do an invisible man fight.
[39:22.89]Where there's just, like, ten different gloved hands.
[39:28.94]So who gives a shit?
[39:29.74]None of this matters.
[39:34.08]CPU logic, we'll put the points in.
[39:42.10]Let's go with punch because of their hands.
[39:48.61]No kicks.
[39:49.49]Kick is going to be at zero.
[39:52.17]Can you keep it there please?
[39:55.05]Okay, throw will be a 10.
[39:58.15]Arm is going to be at a zero because there's no arms.
[40:01.77]Is there a hands?
[40:02.75]Yeah, punch.
[40:04.65]That's fine.
[40:05.55]Aerial, that's good.

[40:08.38]Stretch.
[40:10.92]Joints.

[40:14.30]Huge entertainment value.
[40:16.74]Huge technical value.
[40:17.86]Huge agility value.
[40:20.34]And arm is technically hands, so that's fine.
[40:24.20]Alright, save.
[40:25.82]Dan McCarthy, the Invisible Man.
[40:28.90]Save him.
[40:30.69]He will also be here.

[40:37.07]There he is.
[40:39.81]And a new wrestler.
[40:44.16]I probably don't have to do this every time.
[40:47.22]How many people can be in a rumble?
[40:49.30]Let's first figure this out, first of all.
[40:52.04]Battle Royale over the rope.
[40:55.32]How many people can be in this?
[40:59.28]Matches?
[41:00.02]One.
[41:00.86]Match rules?
[41:03.32]Speed?
[41:03.66]Oh, I thought that was a hundred people.
[41:05.10]I was going to say, no way.
[41:08.61]Outside?
[41:09.19]Oh, critical return.
[41:11.73]What's the... Is it only eight people?
[41:19.01]I can only have eight people.
[41:26.10]Hold on.
[41:28.17]Random select, uh, can I do settings?
[41:30.49]No.
[41:34.57]Tornado.
[41:36.75]DQ count on.
[41:38.20]Why the fuck would that be on?
[41:41.16]Is there a game here?
[41:42.04]I don't know.
[41:44.40]Win condition is three count.
[41:46.84]What are you fucking talking about?
[41:48.97]Match rules?
[41:50.85]I wanted to do over the top, bro.
[41:52.31]What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[41:56.87]Okay, Battle Royale.
[41:59.24]Maybe I can just do Exhibition.
[42:00.06]Alright, well this is a landmine deathmatch.
[42:04.40]So if you thought that there was nothing in this game, then there's at least a landmine deathmatch.
[42:13.18]Over Rope.
[42:17.00]Okay, so why... Why is Over Top Rope off?
[42:23.45]Does that make any sense to anybody else?
[42:27.54]DQ count off.
[42:31.52]Alright, so we have to make eight people.
[42:38.25]That's for certain.
[42:41.15]Just do endless and don't turn the stream off.
[42:43.87]Why is it fucking 4v4?
[42:50.37]Speed.
[42:54.49]Let's just see what happens here.
[42:55.39]I'm just curious.
[42:56.80]What is gonna happen?
[42:59.40]I- I- I- Jesus Christ!
[43:03.67]Where am I?
[43:04.91]Why do I have to eliminate myself?
[43:29.17]Let's go back to the menu for a second
[43:55.33]Mission mode.
[43:56.09]No, let's do tournament.
[43:59.95]No.
[44:01.38]Maybe exhibition will do it.
[44:04.06]Just like a normal match.
[44:06.36]Settings.
[44:09.44]Rope.
[44:10.44]No.
[44:11.88]I think I had it, but you can only... It has to be 4v4.
[44:19.79]That's kind of dumb.
[44:25.70]Oh, let's go with your baby face, right?
[44:32.48]Now this is Dan McCarthy.
[44:36.12]It did say landmine match.
[44:40.78]Okay, so I gotta make eight people.
[44:44.02]So I got... Make Twitch chat?
[44:48.03]I don't know if I can.
[44:51.35]We have to think of teams here.
[44:55.42]This is gonna be fucking awful.
[44:56.48]Alright, let's go back to like the fun thing.
[44:58.77]Let's go back to edit mode.
[45:02.51]Let's make a referee.
[45:10.37]This guy's gonna be fucking useless.
[45:13.22]Down time, slightly long.
[45:16.41]Fall count, slow.
[45:17.85]DQ count, fast.
[45:21.27]Ring out count, fast.
[45:23.10]Move speed, super fast.
[45:25.94]Run and check, long.
[45:27.22]Involvement, long.
[45:29.33]Voice?
[45:30.73]Oh god, American male.
[45:33.59]That's good.
[45:34.49]Appearance edit.
[45:35.95]Who fucking cares?
[46:02.11]I don't care about any of this.
[46:04.87]Because this guy's not even going to be in a match.
[46:15.98]Give him a big head.
[46:16.72]Give him a big chest, too.
[46:21.90]Why not?
[46:23.84]Alright, that's fine.
[46:24.78]Just get rid of his hair.
[46:26.84]This is good enough.
[46:27.42]I don't care about any of this shit.
[46:30.58]No, it'll be like an anime girl face.
[46:34.85]Yeah, that's perfect.
[46:36.23]Here we go.
[46:39.49]Who's your referee?
[46:45.46]There.
[46:49.30]Alright, there you go.
[46:53.46]Save.
[46:54.58]New save.
[46:56.16]Useless.
[47:00.47]No, the voice stays the same.
[47:02.76]Edit mode.
[47:03.36]Wrestler.
[47:03.78]Team edit.
[47:04.52]Ring edit.
[47:07.80]This is all too much for me right now.
[47:10.28]Create a new edit.
[47:11.08]Build from blank.
[47:12.06]Alright, what was another one I was going to do?
[47:13.69]How about... There's like a bunch of other... I've got to get some creative juices flowing.
[47:24.67]You know what I'm saying?
[47:25.20]I have to creatively...
[47:29.09]get involved here.
[47:32.19]Do ring edit.
[47:33.01]Maybe I can make a tiny ring.
[47:34.67]Actually, that's true.
[47:38.42]Let's try it.
[47:38.84]Let's give it a whirl.
[47:39.68]What do you say?
[47:43.32]Uh, go back.
[47:45.14]Gotta have Gabe.
[47:46.60]Yeah, we can make Lumia.
[47:47.45]We will.
[47:48.93]Ring edit.
[47:50.57]Create.
[47:51.85]New ring.
[47:53.97]Okay, ring design.
[47:55.71]Turnbuckle.
[47:57.23]This is all just tacked on nonsense.
[47:59.62]None of this shit is, like, any good.
[48:02.30]Texture.
[48:03.34]We can't make, like, a baby ring.
[48:06.80]Yeah.
[48:07.34]There's no baby ring.
[48:12.38]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[48:16.73]Delete this ring.
[48:21.03]Back.
[48:21.37]What?
[48:24.40]We gotta make a few more people first.
[48:29.06]You know what I'm saying?
[48:34.73]Let's forget about the name.
[48:36.13]I gotta get in there and see.
[48:40.37]Turn the menu.
[48:42.11]Appearance.
[48:42.65]This is what I need to do.
[48:46.54]Uh, let's go with, let's go to the faces and just take a look down here.
[48:49.90]I love what we're doing.
[48:50.78]This is going to be like, this is like an hour and a half long of making people for a like 45, like maybe like a 45 second match that we're going to laugh at for 10 seconds.
[49:02.05]Alright, hold on.
[49:03.67]I think, I think I got it.
[49:05.47]I think I like what I'm looking at here.
[49:09.55]Glue Man.
[49:09.95]Alright.
[49:10.27]I'll try to make Glue Man.
[49:14.27]Delete all this shit.
[49:18.98]Is the new Jerma Rumble going to be using this game?
[49:21.12]No.
[49:22.48]It will not be.
[49:28.55]Let's go.
[49:29.23]We need to make his head.
[49:30.07]Is there a pointy head guy?
[49:31.49]Yeah, I don't think there is.
[49:34.31]These are female heads.
[49:38.71]Scroll up.
[49:42.29]I think that's kind of glue, man.
[49:43.38]Let's get rid of the hair.
[49:49.74]Kill the meme stream is the next rumble that's going to happen.
[49:55.38]I think I kind of like the sad face.
[50:02.01]Just make the rumble right now.
[50:03.23]We're going to have to make this guy too.
[50:04.53]Alright, let's get to it.
[50:08.11]Time to make Gloom Man.
[50:08.85]Here we go.
[50:09.21]It's fine.
[50:12.43]It's going to be kind of like that weird paste looking color.
[50:18.82]Just like this.
[50:20.00]His body doesn't match his skin though.
[50:21.69]That's not cool.
[50:23.35]Don't like that.
[50:27.57]What the heck?
[50:31.56]Why is that different?
[50:33.02]That's bullshit.
[50:36.92]Why is that different?
[50:41.36]Now he's just blue man.
[50:42.45]Yeah.
[50:47.17]This is gonna be like a bizarro world Glue Man, because I don't think I can even do capes.
[50:52.19]This is like fat Glue Man.
[50:55.39]What if I go back to faces?
[50:59.76]This guy's green.
[51:04.18]Where's the back of his head?
[51:07.40]Why does his head disappear?
[51:12.24]Alright, well, let's try another one.
[51:16.12]Because that's a mask.
[51:17.12]That's why it's doing that.
[51:19.98]Oh, it's because of that.
[51:20.82]I see.
[51:21.14]These are the full heads up here.
[51:26.96]What the fuck?
[51:27.92]Come on.
[51:30.27]No, is this a full head?
[51:31.39]It is.
[51:32.61]Alright, perfect.
[51:36.25]Make it more blue.
[51:37.01]What's in his mouth?
[51:43.95]Glue Man is on the workshop.
[51:45.85]Are you serious?
[51:48.47]Large.
[51:51.19]Let's go with... This just looks like a giant baby.
[51:54.95]This isn't even Glue Man.
[51:56.01]Well, you know, this is Bizarro Shitbag Glue Man, so who cares?
[51:58.69]This is fine.
[52:03.15]He's large.
[52:03.99]We gotta put shit on his body.
[52:07.17]That's not... We might as well keep it as John Smith.
[52:11.11]If I'm honest.
[52:14.25]Alright, we need a cape.
[52:16.05]Neck.
[52:18.09]Thigh, forearm, upper arm, waist, chest, face.
[52:20.09]Like, there's no cape.
[52:24.81]Oh, here's the dumb shit that's in his mouth.
[52:26.27]You get, like, teeth in there.
[52:27.57]Alright.
[52:29.71]No, there's no capes.
[52:38.68]Chest?
[52:38.96]Would it be on chest?
[52:42.90]Maybe.
[52:45.39]This is such a terrible glue, man.
[52:50.15]There's only bras on here.
[52:51.69]And baby bibs.
[52:54.62]That's the closest thing we're gonna get.
[52:56.64]Is a fucking baby bib.
[52:59.26]Is it back?
[53:02.19]No.
[53:03.73]No.
[53:05.17]This is baby glue, man.
[53:06.75]Apparently, that's fine.
[53:13.28]There.
[53:14.44]There you go.
[53:14.92]I can't even put it on his back.
[53:21.75]Where was the baby bib?
[53:23.39]I just missed it.
[53:24.23]Where the hell is it?
[53:28.37]This is that.
[53:28.79]This is a 0 out of 10 glue, man.
[53:33.79]Glue, baby.
[53:35.91]Where's the bib?
[53:41.07]Where did I fucking see the bib?
[53:42.35]There it is.
[53:47.66]Now this is now this is you know, I got a better fucking idea because we're this is Donald fucking duck Figured it out already guys Donald duck Where's that fucked up duck face There he is this is Donald duck What color is Donald duck's face
[54:21.08]He's got... I need to picture a Donald Duck or I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[54:24.98]Donald Duck.
[54:28.42]Images.
[54:28.78]Alright, he's got that... He's got the... He's got the orange beak.
[54:33.72]He's got that funny hat on.
[54:35.20]Okay.
[54:36.68]I see him.
[54:37.04]Okay, so he's got the funny hat.
[54:39.43]He's already wearing... He's got the orange beak.
[54:48.67]How the fuck is that not... What's going on here?
[54:54.12]There we go.
[54:54.66]Okay.
[54:56.05]That's his hat.
[54:56.65]His hat is blue.
[54:58.99]Do they have a regular hat?
[55:00.17]Like one of those weird goofy ones that he has on.
[55:04.97]It's like a beret.
[55:08.67]No, that's not it.
[55:10.69]Here we go.
[55:13.31]Uh, no, that's kind of... This is Donald Schmuck.
[55:27.32]You got a sailor suit on.
[55:32.38]This kind of looks like it.
[55:37.52]No, that's a bandana.
[55:44.45]That's not it.
[55:48.45]No, that was as close as we're going to get.
[55:50.27]One of these down here.
[55:51.15]One of these like this one.
[55:52.09]This one.
[55:55.35]It's like a train conductor.
[56:02.30]Alright, now he's got... His eyes are fine.
[56:05.01]Where are his eyes?
[56:06.47]His eyes need to be black.
[56:09.19]That's good.
[56:12.01]He's got... Looking good so far.
[56:16.05]He just needs a red bowtie.
[56:20.03]Very important.
[56:25.23]Bowtie.
[56:25.73]There we go.
[56:30.31]This has to be red.
[56:34.68]It's coming along pretty well.
[56:37.31]Now he needs a sailor shirt and no pants.
[56:41.69]And his feet are going to be just regular.
[56:45.85]Don't change the body.
[56:46.83]What do you mean don't change the body?
[56:47.81]I've got to make him tiny.
[56:49.77]This is Donald Duck, man.
[56:50.83]Alright, then we've got... What else does he have here?
[57:01.14]He's got those orange feet.
[57:03.90]Sailor shirt.
[57:05.00]Okay.
[57:05.28]We just have to put a shirt on.
[57:06.96]This is essentially what has to happen here.
[57:08.52]Shirt.
[57:11.52]No, this is going to go underneath everything.
[57:15.18]I don't... This is going to go underneath everything.
[57:22.47]Can I move this up?
[57:28.79]I don't think I can drag this up.
[57:31.98]At least I don't think so.
[57:35.40]I'm going to have to just change his body color to blue.
[57:37.30]There we go.
[57:39.18]Okay, here.
[57:40.94]Blue.
[57:45.40]This is fucking awful.
[57:48.26]This is awful.
[57:50.32]This is the worst.
[57:52.49]I need something on his shoulders too.
[57:59.97]No, no.
[58:00.69]It's going to be underneath.
[58:03.47]Nope.
[58:04.81]I don't think I can give him anything on his arms.
[58:08.73]He's like a jacket.
[58:12.01]Nope.
[58:14.23]Yeah, that's it.
[58:14.69]I'm just gonna have to make him... I'm gonna have to make him just, like, white.
[58:17.17]Yeah, that's fine.
[58:20.11]Just get rid of that.
[58:20.73]Uh, so it needs to be... It needs to have... What about his, like, butt?
[58:24.26]It's probably, like, a weird bird butt.
[58:25.64]I would have to assume there is.
[58:27.72]Waist, upper arm... Okay, upper arms.
[58:32.48]It's gonna be like a... There it is!
[58:33.66]There it is!
[58:36.80]That's too much though.
[58:38.80]Right?
[58:42.78]I mean, that's kind of... That's way too much, I think.
[58:49.84]He's just like a giant bird.
[58:53.30]That's alright.
[58:54.42]I mean, it still kind of works.
[58:55.84]Now we need forearms.
[58:59.00]Same deal.
[59:00.12]They gotta be bird arms.
[59:03.18]Oh, my God.
[59:04.04]Okay.
[59:05.04]Hands.
[59:05.38]What do you have?
[59:05.90]He's got just these, like, white hands.
[59:11.97]They're not bird hands, though.
[59:12.93]They're just kind of white gloves.
[59:14.07]Alright, and then we got his naked body.
[59:15.93]Lower body.
[59:17.93]So, waist.
[59:20.99]Is there a bird waist?
[59:21.87]There is.
[59:23.79]That's good.
[59:24.15]We have to get rid of the underwear, though.
[59:28.57]There we go.
[59:30.65]and then his legs are these orange extremely defined orange legs this is just what I would oh come on what I can't change that shit he has to be wearing something otherwise I can't make him a different color
[60:01.43]Okay, now this can be orange.
[60:03.61]Yeah, there we go.
[60:09.62]There we are.
[60:10.64]Same thing down below.
[60:11.64]And that's good.
[60:16.24]Now we need calves.
[60:18.95]Get rid of all this shit.
[60:24.19]These are fine.
[60:24.95]They need to be skinny, though.
[60:29.09]Docs have a corkscrew-shaped penis.
[60:30.81]Well, that's funny because I can't edit his penis.
[60:34.37]In case you were wondering.
[60:35.45]That's not an editable feature on here.
[60:38.58]So, maybe in a different game.
[60:42.66]But not this one.
[60:46.04]Alright, so we got... Um... Okay, here we go.
[60:57.25]Place your bets on Donald Duck because I think he's going to be like the favorite.
[61:00.87]But that's not true.
[61:01.65]It could be the fucking hands.
[61:04.39]There we go.
[61:06.37]Close enough.
[61:07.82]And then he has bird feet.
[61:09.82]Which I guarantee you there's bird feet.
[61:12.14]Yeah, there is.
[61:13.92]No, that doesn't look like that though.
[61:21.53]No, god damn it.
[61:22.53]Stop doing that.
[61:23.17]Alright, bird feet.
[61:26.12]There they are.
[61:27.48]You guys didn't think there was going to be duck feet.
[61:29.28]Of course there is.
[61:30.28]They're going to be a little bigger.
[61:32.60]We'll get to that.
[61:33.25]It's a process.
[61:39.09]Why are we doing this in this game?
[61:43.55]I could just go get 2k18 and we could just do that here.
[61:50.05]Whatever.
[61:50.53]You know what the deal is.
[61:51.79]Let's go.
[61:52.17]Let's get his proportions right.
[61:58.85]We, this is all you.
[61:59.85]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[62:00.77]He's got these little legs.
[62:06.90]And he's got like a big butt.
[62:08.98]His hands are fairly large.
[62:10.34]Not that big though.
[62:11.14]His forearms are not this big.
[62:16.24]Neither are these.
[62:16.66]These are really small actually.
[62:19.13]Like that?
[62:20.87]No, not like that.
[62:21.71]You can see his... You can see his very clearly human chest underneath this.
[62:30.09]So let's go ahead and like make that at least big enough where you can't see.
[62:34.70]His waist is big.
[62:35.78]Because he is Donald Duck.
[62:42.38]His chest is smaller.
[62:45.85]Like that.
[62:47.07]And his face, he's got like a big head.
[62:49.47]Not that huge though, like that.
[62:52.38]Okay.
[62:54.78]There it is.
[62:56.94]Donald fucking duck, baby.
[63:00.23]Let's go to his face.
[63:02.47]What is this thing?
[63:03.19]Get rid of it.
[63:05.41]What is like, why is it doubling up here?
[63:09.15]Okay, that's fine.
[63:12.16]Strong.
[63:12.96]He's going to be a shooter.
[63:14.30]Hold on, this is a different thing.
[63:17.52]No, he's going to be a luchador.
[63:18.96]He's a bird, for Christ's sake.
[63:20.06]There we go.
[63:23.24]I don't know.
[63:26.83]Coppo seems kind of like a bird fighting style.
[63:28.95]What do you guys think?
[63:35.75]It looks like a bootleg McDonald's character that never saw the light of day.
[63:42.25]That's kind of a bird style.
[63:46.17]That's fine.
[63:46.99]I've got to make his chest not this.
[63:48.91]I've got to change his skin color.
[63:54.32]Separated.
[63:54.94]There we go.
[63:56.64]Now I should be able to just go to his face here, right?
[64:02.12]Where?
[64:02.36]I don't even know where.
[64:03.14]How can I even do this?
[64:08.19]Good luck.
[64:09.93]Um... Upper arm?
[64:12.77]Like... Calf?
[64:14.37]Here we go.
[64:15.15]I should be able to turn this white.
[64:19.25]Looks like it doesn't fucking do anything.
[64:22.23]It's alright.
[64:22.63]Don't matter.
[64:24.17]Chest.
[64:25.35]Here it is.
[64:25.73]Okay.
[64:28.88]Oh, come on!
[64:29.56]What?
[64:33.92]Well, we're just gonna make it orange then.
[64:37.01]Because Donald Duck's, like, body is gonna be orange.
[64:39.29]That's just the way it is.
[64:41.21]Everything else is orange.
[64:43.69]That works.
[64:44.13]I don't care.
[64:44.93]Fuck it.
[64:46.19]Confirm.
[64:48.52]There he is.
[64:49.06]John Smith.
[64:51.28]Wrestler name and profile.
[64:52.36]This is Donald.
[64:55.28]Donald Duck.
[64:59.33]Donald Duck.
[65:04.07]Choose a different chest.
[65:05.17]What do you mean choose a different chest?
[65:06.88]No, it's too late.
[65:08.88]Blue?
[65:09.26]No, but this is- ah!
[65:15.10]Go back.
[65:16.66]Wrestler appearance.
[65:17.62]Alright, fine.
[65:18.30]I'll do his blue chest.
[65:21.20]Oh, what the fuck.
[65:22.99]Stop this.
[65:27.09]Separate.
[65:32.11]There you go.
[65:32.59]Blue.
[65:35.58]There's the Donald Duck blue chest.
[65:44.22]And let me, let me ask you something.
[65:46.06]Why, why do you fucking, why do you guys care anyways?
[65:52.67]Do you really care that much about Donald Duck in Fire Pro Wrestling's shit character?
[66:00.44]There's no fucking way you really do.
[66:03.40]Alright, he's gonna be S. No, he'll be B. And he'll be C. Is it like a... I don't know.
[66:14.97]I have no idea what these are gonna be.
[66:17.97]But we're doing random ones for all of them.
[66:24.34]Alright, Donald Duck.
[66:25.34]He's from America.
[66:26.20]Alright, move set.
[66:31.42]I like it.
[66:34.14]That's pretty much a Donald Duck... Donald Duck line, if you ask me.
[66:43.21]Look, I didn't even have to put this here.
[66:44.93]He even has a bird move.
[66:46.43]Diving body press is his special move.
[66:49.39]That's perfect.
[66:50.85]Okay.
[66:55.12]These are all fine.
[66:56.00]Back neck break chop block.
[66:59.26]Back tackle.
[67:00.35]Why is it always they're fighting themselves?
[67:03.29]That's a pretty good Donald Duck if you ask me.
[67:06.13]This is all fine.
[67:06.85]None of this fucking matters anyways.
[67:08.47]This is like a three hour stream for like a 12 minute joke.
[67:12.19]I hope you guys are aware of this.
[67:16.24]Alright, who's next?
[67:18.74]We're going to make his parameters a little bit.
[67:20.50]Let's make him not useless.
[67:23.56]I don't even know how the CPU is in this game.
[67:25.60]This might go on for like an hour and a half.
[67:31.33]I want to control one of them.
[67:32.43]I have to make me.
[67:32.89]You know what I mean?
[67:35.71]Because I want to control me in the game.
[67:37.83]Because I want to play the game.
[67:40.47]Donald Duck is going to be pretty fucking great, by the way.
[67:45.76]Okay.
[67:48.70]Save.
[67:50.08]New save.
[67:51.34]Keep him as a baby face.
[67:53.78]He's saved, right?
[67:55.06]There it is.
[67:55.48]Iron Giant.
[67:56.04]Dan McCarthy.
[67:57.28]Who the fuck is Dan?
[67:58.20]Oh, right.
[67:58.70]It's the Invisible Man.
[68:00.69]Alright, we haven't, wait, we got, I'm gonna just make me.
[68:02.51]I'm gonna make me.
[68:03.39]Let's get another template.
[68:08.71]Arrested edit.
[68:10.09]Create new edit.
[68:11.74]Me.
[68:14.30]Personal name and profile.
[68:16.88]Jerma, I'm 85.
[68:19.56]First name.
[68:23.78]Last name.
[68:28.34]Okay.
[68:29.51]Ernold Elbertson, Jr., male, America.
[68:31.89]Let's put my actual birthday in here.
[68:33.93]There we go.
[68:38.80]And month, that is... No, come on, man.
[68:43.50]There we go.
[68:47.00]Height.
[68:48.66]5'8".
[68:48.74]Weight, 1.
[68:48.96]150, 1 like 50, 1 like 58. 58.
[68:57.60]Okay.
[69:00.18]Wrestler appearance.
[69:02.22]Leaked.
[69:06.35]I'm not that tall, so we're going to do small.
[69:08.79]Preset.
[69:12.89]No, these are just default trash wrestlers.
[69:15.13]Alright, let's make me.
[69:19.79]Let's make how I see myself.
[69:21.93]You know what I'm saying?
[69:22.73]I think that's a fair thing to do.
[69:27.16]This is how I see myself in the mirror.
[69:29.76]I look in the mirror, and... This is what I see.
[69:38.61]Let's start with the head.
[69:44.53]You can make a pretty good Undertaker if you wanted to.
[69:47.07]It's gotta be bald?
[69:48.15]Of course he does.
[69:49.11]Yeah, of course he does.
[69:50.01]Look at that chin!
[69:51.41]That's me.
[69:53.15]One of these is me.
[69:55.23]That's a really strong fucking chin.
[70:01.58]Uh, let's get a little bit of a... Let's get some balding going on here.
[70:07.26]I'm not completely bald.
[70:09.80]Looks alright.
[70:11.41]My head is kind of small.
[70:12.55]What is, like, just the hair color here?
[70:15.85]Hmm, we need to, like, blonde.
[70:18.31]Like, dirty blonde, like, right there.
[70:19.99]Uh, head size is like this.
[70:26.78]Chest.
[70:27.86]I've got a really wide chest.
[70:29.46]I've been told that before.
[70:31.68]I have a very skinny waist, I've heard.
[70:34.00]I'm like a 31 waist.
[70:37.69]My biceps are pretty big.
[70:39.39]Forearms are very small.
[70:40.81]I've been very self-conscious about that over the years.
[70:43.75]My hands are a little bit larger than normal.
[70:46.97]Thighs are small.
[70:47.69]Actually, I have pretty big thighs.
[70:49.76]Calves are small.
[70:50.76]I've been fucking self-conscious of that too.
[70:54.50]Feet size, they're pretty normal, I would say.
[70:58.96]Let's see, let's go to... Waist is a little bit smaller than that.
[71:02.83]Chest is smaller as well.
[71:05.57]Heads are smaller than that.
[71:06.85]Okay, there we go.
[71:08.41]This is not the right hair color.
[71:10.77]Now it is.
[71:11.35]Alright, size, small.
[71:17.57]I would consider myself to be kind of a technician.
[71:20.37]No, I'm mysterious.
[71:26.84]What's with that neck creak?
[71:29.86]That's fine.
[71:31.14]Looking good.
[71:31.62]Anything else on my face?
[71:33.54]Do I have anything?
[71:36.04]What do I do?
[71:37.23]Sometimes I wear masks and shit.
[71:39.03]I have big eyes.
[71:43.23]Sometimes I stick my tongue out.
[71:47.69]Wait, what?
[71:49.61]What else have we got?
[71:53.75]No, we'll keep that.
[71:55.74]That's fine.
[71:57.38]I'm going to go to chest.
[72:01.68]Let's put on some clothes.
[72:08.17]There is no clown suit, so sorry guys, not going to happen.
[72:16.69]There is no clown costume.
[72:19.11]Even though I maybe, you know, we could probably make a clown costume.
[72:21.89]Fine.
[72:22.19]We're going to make it a clown costume.
[72:27.14]Here we go.
[72:28.86]You want to see a fucking clown?
[72:30.38]You're about to see a clown.
[72:33.88]Let's go with like green.
[72:36.16]Like, no.
[72:37.06]Red and, what's a clown costume really like?
[72:38.88]Like blue and red, right?
[72:42.82]Doesn't really matter as long as it looks fucking ridiculous.
[72:49.77]Uh, green.
[72:52.15]That's fine.
[72:53.03]Look, I'm like the Jerma985 clown.
[72:55.05]Those are my colors.
[72:58.04]Let's get some more, like, wild shit on me.
[73:03.22]Uh, this is still chest.
[73:07.01]No, I'm not gonna put a bra on.
[73:08.11]That's not gonna happen.
[73:12.43]I gotta do clown makeup.
[73:14.17]I mean, that's certain.
[73:16.84]So let's do, see if I can get some clown makeup on.
[73:21.84]Tell me to stop if you see a clown.
[73:28.24]That's kind of a clown.
[73:29.44]Kind of.
[73:30.00]No, no.
[73:30.90]This is.
[73:35.27]That's a clown.
[73:38.07]Okay.
[73:39.61]This is red clown.
[73:43.09]That looks good.
[73:43.99]I'm going to paint the face white.
[73:46.93]I think I have to wear a mask for this.
[73:55.16]Turn on the facecam so we can see.
[73:57.34]No.
[73:57.56]This is getting really creepy.
[74:00.74]What the hell is that?
[74:06.97]No.
[74:07.77]No.
[74:08.41]No.
[74:08.97]I don't like any of it.
[74:12.64]None of this will do.
[74:15.63]No, none of this will do.
[74:16.73]Yeah.
[74:20.55]Was that a monkey?
[74:21.31]I mean, there's probably a ton of weird shit here.
[74:24.37]Probably like bears, animals.
[74:27.47]What's with the mouths?
[74:28.37]What's with the mouth shit?
[74:29.61]I don't know.
[74:37.06]Why do they have a Guy Fieri?
[74:45.76]Clown nose?
[74:46.92]You saw a clown nose, where?
[74:51.02]What is this, some kind of currency thing?
[74:56.11]No, alright, time to move on.
[75:05.59]Right there?
[75:07.73]No, I'm not making Guy Fieri next, that's not gonna happen.
[75:11.31]Sorry.
[75:17.33]There's one thing I'm not going to do.
[75:18.49]It's make Guy Fieri.
[75:21.53]There we go.
[75:21.85]That's like a clown nose.
[75:24.70]No, it isn't.
[75:25.78]It doesn't.
[75:26.10]It just looks like somebody threw blood in my face.
[75:28.76]Last attempt.
[75:31.60]Give me a clown face.
[75:39.00]No, that's not a clown either.
[75:40.48]But, you know, it's close enough.
[75:42.48]It looks like I just did a really bad job doing clown makeup.
[75:49.43]Alright, we're done with me.
[75:50.80]I don't ever wear pants, so who cares?
[75:53.64]Let's just get the waist out of the way.
[75:55.10]Let's just get that off.
[75:56.94]I honestly, for one second, I thought there was going to be a dick there.
[75:59.78]I really did.
[76:00.32]Like, I was like, hold on, that's actually naked.
[76:06.05]I gotta be like, oh my god.
[76:08.71]I gotta be fucking ripped with like a weird, fucked up speedo.
[76:18.26]I'm gonna make this flesh-colored.
[76:19.78]Because I am always naked.
[76:25.30]I would prove it right now, but I would get banned forever from twitch.tv.
[76:27.94]Alright, come on.
[76:34.56]I need, like, the right color here.
[76:39.78]Like, down here, right here.
[76:45.35]Oh, I forgot.
[76:46.39]Okay.
[76:46.75]So I forgot.
[76:47.55]Listen, I was going to tell you about my dream.
[76:52.17]I just like pissed my underwear.
[76:53.57]That's what this is.
[76:55.53]Uh, I had a dream that I was naked on Twitch unintentionally.
[77:01.41]So I had like the way I can't, I, I can't, I I'm, I'm actually like, I don't have any clothes on.
[77:06.55]I can't even show you what I was talking about.
[77:08.67]But so I had a dream where I was live on Twitch and the webcam was
[77:14.50]The webcam was pointed in a way where it was only, it was waist down was not showing.
[77:21.93]I had a t-shirt on and I don't know why I didn't have any pants or underwear on, but I had like the webcam on and I didn't know it was on.
[77:28.81]And I just, for some reason, I was trying to lean and not get my like penis seen.
[77:34.12]And I leaned forward and up a little bit to grab something like a USB cable out of the right side of my computer.
[77:39.52]And I was like, wait.
[77:41.20]This webcam is on right now.
[77:42.96]No, no, fuck.
[77:43.41]And I like, I leaned down really quickly down.
[77:45.65]So I thought I was still, it was still at the waist down area.
[77:48.59]We're like, no, I think I'm okay.
[77:49.59]I don't think, I don't think it was on camera.
[77:52.47]And like all of a sudden I look into Twitch chat and spamming is the clip, the clip of what happened.
[77:58.66]And I was like, no, no, no.
[77:59.66]Did it happen guys?
[78:00.94]Did you see it?
[78:01.98]And I clicked on a clip and then somebody put an image in the chat too.
[78:06.34]And I clicked on this fucking image and it was just me, my pants down, like nothing on, just penis out.
[78:14.75]And I was like, I'm ruined forever.
[78:17.21]It was clipped like a hundred fucking times.
[78:19.93]And I was seriously like rolling around in bed in a nightmare thinking it was real.
[78:25.68]And I woke up and it was that, you know, that that sigh of relief that you get to have when you know that a dream wasn't real, but it was very realistic.
[78:35.30]Look, I'm not saying that it was realistic that I'm going to do this.
[78:39.15]It's actually completely and totally fucking unrealistic.
[78:42.63]But when dream happens and you wake up and you're just like, Jesus Christ, I'm so glad that's not real.
[78:51.74]That's what happened to me because I thought it was real for the first like two minutes of me being awake.
[78:57.82]Alright, I looked over and just saw a clip.
[78:59.40]I'm just like, wait, what?
[79:01.60]Alright, this is going to be close enough.
[79:03.36]I can't get it right.
[79:06.66]There we go.
[79:07.34]Whatever.
[79:09.68]Like, right up here.
[79:10.54]I'm not going to be able to get it exact, so who gives a shit?
[79:14.95]I don't know why I even want to do that in the first place.
[79:18.99]Alright, feet.
[79:20.21]I never have shoes on.
[79:23.97]Although, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[79:28.26]Oh, that's like thighs.
[79:29.28]Okay.
[79:31.58]It's cash.
[79:32.08]There it is.
[79:35.66]Okay, that's good.
[79:37.08]There I am.
[79:37.60]I'm done.
[79:38.50]I want to just control this character.
[79:42.94]I don't care how bad this character is.
[79:44.24]This is the one I'm going to be controlling.
[79:45.45]Okay, America 5-8.
[79:49.61]1990.
[79:49.83]That works.
[79:50.69]Skills.
[79:51.27]Let's just like make sure I don't get instantly eliminated.
[79:55.83]You know what I mean?
[79:58.95]Because that would be annoying.
[79:59.91]I am a junior.
[80:05.44]So, striking, that's fine.
[80:07.36]Let's put some points into the parameters.
[80:12.50]I'm a very good puncher.
[80:13.92]I can tell you that for certain.
[80:15.06]Very good kicker, too.
[80:15.98]I can throw people very far.
[80:18.79]My joints kind of ache.
[80:20.67]I'm not that good at stretching.
[80:21.79]Actually, it hurts when I stretch.
[80:22.83]I'm not that... I mean, I'm moderately powerful.
[80:25.77]But the agility of a goddamn cat...
[80:28.24]My arms are really strong.
[80:30.66]I have problems with math.
[80:32.73]I'm a little bit rough sometimes, but not really.
[80:36.11]I, my, my, um, my... I can't think, you know, we're just gonna give it a five.
[80:43.49]Extremely entertaining.
[80:46.81]And we'll go kicks and punches, that's good.
[80:52.12]My, my athletic ability.
[80:56.28]This is my dating profile.
[80:57.72]Somebody just fucking cut.
[81:06.19]This is my dating profile.
[81:08.33]That's me on like Tinder or like OkCupid.
[81:11.51]You know, listen, let me tell you something.
[81:13.69]My, you know, potential future girlfriend.
[81:15.77]Really good at punching.
[81:17.29]Really good at kicking and throwing.
[81:19.33]I'm really powerful.
[81:20.29]I'm really stupid.
[81:22.86]But I'm sure entertaining like that's like whoa, like don't want to fucking look at this profile.
[81:27.61]That's not a dating profile.
[81:34.89]Moderately rough, oh my Lord.
[81:36.83]I would date you, oh my God.
[81:43.57]Yeah, let me tell you something, I'm like good at fucking fighting people
[81:51.46]But I'm bad at everything else.
[81:54.02]Please love me.
[81:55.10]There I am.
[81:57.96]Done.
[82:01.70]Swipe right.
[82:02.58]Alright, we got, we got, how many more do we need?
[82:06.28]Oh no.
[82:13.99]No.
[82:15.09]Oh lord, what have I done?
[82:16.23]No, no, no, no, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[82:18.45]Let it move.
[82:23.66]Oh, fuck me.
[82:24.46]Alright, wait a minute.
[82:25.88]Four more people?
[82:26.70]Who the fuck are we making now?
[82:31.95]How do I super like?
[82:34.81]Oh, God.
[82:35.61]I'll catch up with the bits at the end of the stream.
[82:40.24]Guy Fieri?
[82:41.04]No.
[82:43.08]We have eight slots.
[82:44.10]You think I'm going to waste it on Guy Fieri?
[82:47.88]We already wasted, like, three spots with, like, the invisible man.
[82:51.43]Make a seagull.
[82:52.05]I like that one.
[82:53.23]I like that.
[82:53.65]No, that's just Donald Duck again, but with no blue shirt on.
[82:58.19]Ugh.
[83:00.05]That's seriously just Donald Duck again without a blue shirt.
[83:07.23]Yeah.
[83:07.81]Hold on.
[83:08.61]Let me see if I can handle it.
[83:09.51]There's gonna be two fucking birds in this.
[83:13.68]That's great.
[83:15.92]Is there another bird I can do that's not that bird?
[83:20.63]Well, a seagull wouldn't have a head that big.
[83:28.11]No.
[83:29.93]Oh my god, fine.
[83:36.25]Seagulls have tiny heads, right?
[83:38.46]They have big chests.
[83:43.46]They're tiny.
[83:48.43]No, I'm not making Garfield.
[83:52.13]Who is this?
[83:53.11]This already is a person.
[83:55.23]This already is someone.
[83:57.49]What is it?
[83:58.15]I don't know who it is.
[84:04.92]It's passing me by right now.
[84:06.16]I don't know who this is and I can see a person.
[84:09.50]I know who it is.
[84:10.68]It's the blob from X-Men.
[84:15.03]That's what I made.
[84:16.34]They're yours right now.
[84:17.50]It wears the same clothes.
[84:19.74]As well.
[84:27.06]Oh yeah, seagulls don't have arms.
[84:31.04]Seagulls don't have arms.
[84:32.40]And they don't have hands.
[84:35.77]They just have bird feathers.
[84:40.57]We're gonna make a sitting seagull.
[84:49.05]Look at those little baby hands.
[84:50.77]Alright, what we got so far?
[84:52.41]Why am I fucking doing another bird?
[84:53.61]I'm gonna look up a seagull.
[84:55.61]They have wings.
[84:56.27]Yeah, but like, they usually, they don't want a cat lies down and stuffs their hands into their body.
[85:01.44]That's how a seagull just walks around.
[85:02.88]They walk around with their hands, cat style, stuffed into their chest and stomach.
[85:10.38]We're gonna, we're gonna make it as if the seagull is, like, resting.
[85:13.06]Alright, chest.
[85:17.82]That's fine.
[85:20.78]There's going to be bird feathers everywhere, of course, like, obviously.
[85:24.78]What does a seagull look like?
[85:26.94]They're called wings.
[85:27.65]I know, but, like, their arms and wings and hands and feet and toes are just going to be staying inside the vehicle at all times.
[85:32.79]You know what I'm saying?
[85:34.29]Seagull.
[85:39.48]Does anybody else find it, like, fucking funny that when you type in seagull into Google...
[85:46.41]The Twitch streamer, Seagull, is the first response from Google.
[85:52.63]If you don't go, go type in the animal, Seagull.
[85:56.43]It's above the actual Seagull.
[85:58.67]This is the real Seagull, is Seagull on Twitch.
[86:00.71]Alright, there it is.
[86:05.85]It's white with little eyes.
[86:12.72]Make Winnie the Pooh.
[86:15.97]Alright, so they have tiny, tiny legs.
[86:19.60]And they're super scrunched in, like I already have.
[86:22.04]Alright, I just need to look at that.
[86:24.48]That does not look anything like what I have.
[86:26.14]So we're going to go face.
[86:29.70]Like that.
[86:31.27]The chest.
[86:31.71]This essentially is the seagull's neck.
[86:35.45]Right?
[86:36.13]So if you take a look at any picture of a seagull, you'll see that their neck goes into their body.
[86:42.63]Like that.
[86:44.38]So this all has to be feathers and shit, so.
[86:51.05]There we go.
[86:52.69]Let's go with, um... What do we got here?
[86:57.59]The head can be a little bigger at this point.
[86:59.96]Like that.
[87:00.68]That's good.
[87:02.92]Parts.
[87:03.30]Okay, what are the... Their beaks are... This is a fucking other Donald Duck beak.
[87:06.18]That's fine.
[87:11.44]Like that.
[87:13.51]They're a little more on the orange side.
[87:17.17]It's like very orange.
[87:20.44]Like orange soda orange.
[87:22.76]Like that.
[87:24.60]They don't have fucking like Donald Trump hair, so let's get rid of that.
[87:28.28]They have these black eyes, right?
[87:36.77]Okay, they don't have like hair.
[87:37.91]This has to go.
[87:41.43]Oh, I can't get rid of it.
[87:42.73]I just have to stay there.
[87:46.27]That looks alright.
[87:54.90]Aye, aye, aye.
[87:55.45]Alright, that's alright.
[87:59.08]Um... We just need to do... This has to be... Let's go to... Chest.
[88:05.75]Bird.
[88:08.27]Waist.
[88:09.49]It's also bird.
[88:10.39]No underwear.
[88:12.41]Actually, it's turning out pretty okay.
[88:17.63]I am actually not upset about this.
[88:19.46]I'm not upset about the two birds.
[88:22.68]Uh, we got... Legs.
[88:26.96]Thighs.
[88:27.62]Bird.
[88:30.71]Calf.
[88:31.65]Bird.
[88:32.03]Get rid of this crap.
[88:34.59]No, no, no, no.
[88:35.13]There's no feathers here.
[88:36.91]That is incorrect.
[88:38.27]It's just... Yeah, that's incorrect.
[88:42.87]Thighs.
[88:44.05]That is also incorrect.
[88:47.43]So the thighs have to be tiny, tiny, tiny.
[88:55.46]Keep the legs normal?
[88:56.70]What do you mean keep the legs normal?
[88:57.84]That wouldn't be an actual... That wouldn't be a seagull.
[89:03.77]And the feet are, they're pretty normal like that.
[89:06.13]They're a little bit big like this.
[89:08.75]And they're yellow.
[89:13.48]So, are they yellow?
[89:14.98]They're kind of red.
[89:17.38]Seagulls have like red, red legs and feet.
[89:19.92]Am I crazy or do they have like these weird red legs?
[89:26.24]Take a look at the pictures of seagulls.
[89:28.44]They got pink legs.
[89:32.13]No, they don't.
[89:33.15]Do they?
[89:35.72]No.
[89:39.24]Not really.
[89:39.92]Some of them do.
[89:46.47]I don't think... Come on, give me a break.
[89:57.99]Cap.
[89:58.53]Gotta put on the regular, regular, regular.
[90:03.15]And their feet are just bird feet.
[90:06.11]That's fine.
[90:09.31]Feet.
[90:15.28]There we go.
[90:16.78]No.
[90:17.42]Where's like the good bird feet?
[90:18.86]There they are.
[90:20.52]Wait.
[90:21.42]Seagulls have claws, right?
[90:23.56]Don't seagulls have like these huge talons?
[90:26.77]No, that's an eagle.
[90:27.57]They have like bird feet.
[90:28.43]There we go.
[90:31.97]There we are.
[90:32.51]These are a little too big.
[90:36.36]Drop them a little, like that, that's good.
[90:39.44]Okay, they have some color though, on their, let's go back to chest, no waist.
[90:46.01]Let's add a stripe, if we can.
[90:48.73]They have, usually have like some black or gray, usually it's gray.
[90:55.23]This one might be alright.
[90:56.67]This weird diaper might be okay too, let's see.
[91:02.72]No.
[91:06.21]Go ahead and delete that.
[91:07.07]Are there wings?
[91:12.25]If there are wings, then this is perfect.
[91:14.17]I don't think there'll be... No.
[91:21.57]The inside of a bird's mouth freaks you out?
[91:25.43]Why?
[91:25.83]Because it's just a weird hole?
[91:32.88]Um, I don't think there are wings.
[91:41.75]Unfortunately, we're gonna have to just live with that.
[91:46.77]Accessories.
[91:48.95]Pants.
[91:49.57]Yeah, it'll be accessories.
[91:51.23]Outerwear.
[91:51.77]What about chest?
[91:57.65]Possibly might be wings here.
[92:02.41]Really?
[92:02.71]That's bullshit.
[92:08.33]Oh well.
[92:08.84]What about back?
[92:10.04]No.
[92:11.81]Well, we tried.
[92:13.37]We tried.
[92:14.35]But there it is.
[92:15.27]There's the seagull.
[92:16.87]Why does the seagull have a hat?
[92:18.99]Because I cannot remove it.
[92:22.71]I can't take it off.
[92:25.13]Should I give him... No, that's it.
[92:26.21]There it is.
[92:26.57]Seagull.
[92:29.80]Make sure everything looks right.
[92:32.96]Make that a little bigger.
[92:33.76]Make this a little bigger.
[92:39.13]Looks pretty good.
[92:39.81]Alright, so, stance.
[92:43.15]We'll go with, uh... Well, he doesn't have any arms, so boxing seems a little ridiculous.
[92:50.68]I like that one.
[92:52.86]This one looks... That looks like a bird move.
[92:55.82]Like a bird of prey.
[92:56.74]I like it.
[93:10.11]Aye, aye, aye.
[93:10.93]Okay.
[93:12.19]Confirm.
[93:14.71]John Smith.
[93:15.59]Alright.
[93:18.39]Seagull.
[93:23.05]John Smith.
[93:27.73]The first and last name doesn't matter.
[93:29.33]Seagull.
[93:38.65]He's a junior.
[93:40.27]And... He's very small.
[93:45.52]He's very small.
[93:46.60]Oh my god.
[93:50.20]He doesn't weigh very much.
[93:52.62]88 pounds.
[94:07.79]He was born on 2000, 2012, uh, 8th, 7th.
[94:25.76]He's a fucking childish.
[94:28.16]Fucking childish.
[94:30.34]No, he doesn't punch.
[94:31.18]He can't punch.
[94:31.82]He's got good kicks.
[94:35.14]He's got agility.
[94:36.05]He's got no arms.
[94:40.13]He can... His aerial is very good, though.
[94:51.16]Oh, he's getting hilarious.
[94:53.60]Fuck.
[94:54.54]I can't get over it.
[94:55.72]Somebody said it, and I can't fucking get over it.
[94:59.34]Nothing will help me get over this.
[95:01.26]Technical is fine.
[95:02.24]He's a little rough.
[95:04.66]He's extremely entertaining.
[95:09.69]He's rough.
[95:10.23]Whatever.
[95:10.59]Okay, move set.
[95:15.49]Fuh!
[95:17.59]Fuh!
[95:18.69]Okay, that's fine.
[95:20.65]Who gives a shit about any of these moves?
[95:24.89]That was actually pretty cool.
[95:26.03]Let's do... Can I do like a backflip?
[95:30.47]Super foot stomp.
[95:32.29]Moonsault foot stomp.
[95:33.55]That's what we want right there.
[95:34.69]That's beautiful.
[95:38.11]Sledgehammer.
[95:41.73]Somersault drop.
[95:43.05]Rolling senton.
[95:45.61]Diving body.
[95:46.77]Frog splash.
[95:50.48]Hearing a bird make that noise is upsetting.
[95:53.60]Twisting moon salt press.
[95:55.04]I don't even know what the hell just happened.
[95:57.08]Phoenix five star.
[95:58.70]Okay, who knows what the hell that was.
[95:59.96]We're gonna use it.
[96:03.12]Let's get, uh, face slap.
[96:08.04]Hey, you like spit?
[96:09.06]I like the spit.
[96:10.20]Oh, we forgot about face.
[96:11.56]We'll have to get rid of that.
[96:13.10]Headbutt.
[96:13.98]I'll change headbutt to...
[96:17.15]Toe kick.
[96:18.03]Yeah, it's more in line with the character, I think.
[96:20.13]Brain Buster, we're gonna change that to... That's dumb.
[96:25.78]We're not gonna do that.
[96:26.84]How about Face Spray Knuckle?
[96:32.90]How about Stomach Crusher?
[96:35.92]I like it.
[96:38.90]It's just a Zumbini, but it's a bird.
[96:41.58]Alright, that's good.
[96:45.87]Save.
[96:47.90]New save.
[96:51.93]Alright, so we need three more people.
[96:57.15]There's the seagull.
[96:58.89]Uh, return to menu.
[96:59.81]Let me just see what we got.
[97:00.55]We got one, two, three, four, five.
[97:03.06]We need three more people.
[97:04.80]This is fucking... This is... This is real dumb.
[97:08.48]Who is this?
[97:09.76]Oh, that's me.
[97:10.40]Okay, alright.
[97:11.18]I guess I have to control one.
[97:14.48]We're not... I'm not doing Guy Fieri.
[97:18.67]I'm not gonna do a Zumbini either.
[97:20.11]Oh, God damn it.
[97:21.13]I have to make a fucking Zumbini now.
[97:23.68]It's just... It just has to happen.
[97:26.10]I know I get it.
[97:27.08]I know.
[97:28.38]It has to.
[97:31.26]Hold on.
[97:35.97]This is gonna be such a dumb shitty... It's all good.
[97:45.82]Wrestler name...
[97:48.56]It's just a giant head and nothing else.
[97:53.58]It's a giant head with like a couple of sticks.
[97:58.82]Let's see if I get this to zero.
[97:59.84]Can I add anything here?
[98:00.78]I think I can make the chest.
[98:06.12]We're gonna get rid of everything but the chest and the waist.
[98:10.18]Stretch Armstrong, that actually would be pretty good.
[98:14.78]Is it possible to make a wrestler's arm so small they're invisible?
[98:17.16]Yes, we already have the invisible man.
[98:19.56]The invisible man is one of the characters.
[98:20.86]It's just a pair of gloves.
[98:21.70]Okay, hand size.
[98:27.31]They don't have any hands.
[98:32.99]No, I'm not going to make Rayman.
[98:34.47]We already have this whole limb situation nonsense already done.
[98:44.39]Here we go.
[98:47.76]This just turned into a makeshift rumble.
[98:49.84]Yeah.
[98:50.90]Kind of did.
[98:51.36]I didn't really want to do... I'm not feeling that great like I was talking about earlier.
[98:56.08]I've had this really awful migraine problem.
[99:01.07]It won't go away.
[99:02.65]But I'm having fun.
[99:03.87]This is kind of relaxing and fun.
[99:07.10]Make the hamburger helper.
[99:08.70]That's just another glove.
[99:09.94]I'm not making another glove character.
[99:12.44]Alright, we need a Zumbini.
[99:13.24]They just have a circle head.
[99:15.99]Oh my lord, it really is going to be a fucking Zumbini.
[99:20.71]Is there just a big expressionless face?
[99:24.15]It's kind of this one.
[99:26.39]Without the eyes.
[99:26.96]They don't have ears though.
[99:31.56]There's so many faces.
[99:38.51]That's very clearly the rock.
[99:41.63]Face 53-1 is the rock.
[99:45.85]No.
[99:46.25]I mean, it could be one of these.
[99:48.83]But we have to add, like, the funny googly eyes.
[99:52.76]Otherwise, it doesn't work.
[99:58.66]What kind of Zumbini is it going to be, though?
[100:00.10]The propeller?
[100:03.34]Make a beer?
[100:04.29]No, that's a waste of a slot.
[100:06.56]You guys all know that.
[100:07.32]That is a total waste of a character slot.
[100:09.73]There we go!
[100:21.91]Isn't there a Zumbini that has this?
[100:25.46]Alright, got it!
[100:28.90]It's like the Zumbini girl that has that ponytail, right?
[100:38.51]First of all, it's going to be blue.
[100:43.30]No, now it's just... Now it's just, what's her name?
[100:47.08]Not Veruca.
[100:47.76]Who's the blueberry girl from Willy Wonka?
[100:53.51]Violet.
[100:55.19]Yeah, we're making Violet.
[100:59.37]Okay, we need... What color was their hair?
[101:02.34]I think it was just black, right?
[101:08.36]Pretty sure the hair was just black.
[101:12.22]So we need to make a little makeshift zumbini thing here.
[101:15.56]Let's go with chest.
[101:18.71]What can we add here to make this a zumbini?
[101:26.13]No.
[101:26.43]What about waist?
[101:28.39]I think I have to make the waist a little bigger.
[101:33.20]Because I can't really...
[101:38.35]There's no particle effects or anything, so it can't be something... She's an iPad stylus.
[101:49.24]Oh, it's a finger puppet.
[101:52.10]This is just a head finger puppet with a weird alien finger that's going inside of her head.
[102:04.91]No, it's not going to work.
[102:11.46]um I think we're just gonna have to go because there's no wheels or anything can I wait a minute damn it no it's not gonna work I was gonna say can I just push it down I can't put it all the way down um so there's no feet
[102:39.18]So this is the neck.
[102:40.88]They don't really have a neck though.
[102:43.59]No, they don't.
[102:44.39]This has to go away.
[102:49.17]And then at the bottom of this is going to be something.
[102:53.31]I wish I could put shoes here.
[102:54.40]Small.
[103:00.68]That luchador would be good because they move around a lot.
[103:08.27]Alright, this'll work.
[103:13.59]Kind of.
[103:17.02]No, it has to be one that's bouncing around.
[103:22.42]Nope, it's gotta be like this.
[103:23.66]There's something at the bottom of this.
[103:25.18]Just one thing at the bottom.
[103:28.64]Whatever the hell it can be on chest.
[103:37.38]Alright, this one actually is better.
[103:38.88]Alright, we gotta find it.
[103:44.51]We gotta find the one thing that sits at the bottom.
[103:48.71]This one?
[103:51.25]This one's pretty close.
[103:53.69]Springboard!
[103:54.71]Springboard!
[103:55.29]Where's the pinstripes?
[103:56.73]Springboard!
[103:57.41]Got it!
[103:59.61]What color was the springboard?
[104:04.13]It was kind of, it was a gray, right?
[104:09.87]And I don't like the face we're gonna change the face here You just add the weird eyes face It's like an orange yellow I gotta pee bad
[104:33.00]No, that's not going to work.
[104:34.20]I got to pee.
[104:35.68]Let me just take a quick piss.
[104:39.53]I'll be right back.
[104:43.27]Pee break.
[104:44.71]I'll be right back, guys.
[105:21.07]Wait, what?
[107:31.00]Okay.
[107:32.24]There we are.
[107:33.44]Why are you guys counting now?
[107:36.72]Do you want a countdown for me to return to the stream?
[107:39.38]What did I do?
[107:39.84]Oh, this.
[107:43.62]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[107:45.64]If you are, make sure you hit that follow button.
[107:47.74]You know what I mean?
[107:51.63]Make sure you join the stream, you know?
[107:53.17]Let's go.
[108:01.99]fucking seagulls looking at me and shit.
[108:10.28]Donald Duck staring at me.
[108:11.38]Let's continue.
[108:14.92]So what was I doing?
[108:17.24]I was doing... Oh yeah, eyes.
[108:19.74]I need eyes.
[108:20.06]I need weird eyes.
[108:21.33]Hmm...
[108:34.32]That's pretty weird.
[108:35.02]I think that's pretty, that's pretty good.
[108:38.06]That's weird.
[108:41.34]Close enough.
[108:41.76]They didn't have like weird white mouths, but who, whatever, who cares?
[108:52.37]Wait, are we in emote only mode now?
[108:53.85]What happened?
[108:57.81]What happened to the emotes?
[108:59.68]Oh Lord.
[109:03.31]Alright, I think that's alright.
[109:06.83]Springboard was... Wait, I need to look up the Zumbinis.
[109:09.91]It's important.
[109:13.61]Zumbinis.
[109:13.93]Alright, it was orange.
[109:21.46]Orange.
[109:21.78]The hair was purple.
[109:25.62]And there's no clown noses, but orange hair.
[109:27.50]I mean, orange spring and purple hair.
[109:35.85]Like a weird dark purple that I didn't have this shit though, so let's get rid of that There we go No, that's not right
[110:06.14]That's not correct.
[110:11.95]That's as close as we're gonna get, though.
[110:14.49]It's all good.
[110:16.59]Uh, gonna go back to the... Was it thigh?
[110:19.55]Right?
[110:19.71]I don't even know what we are.
[110:21.93]Calf?
[110:23.23]No.
[110:23.69]What is it?
[110:24.13]Waist?
[110:25.91]I have no idea what it is.
[110:27.11]Chest.
[110:28.29]Orange.
[110:29.41]The yellowish orange.
[110:35.59]Alright, this is Zumbini.
[110:38.69]Now that sucks.
[110:40.01]No, I refuse.
[110:43.38]That's it, it's gotta be a different head.
[110:45.22]I don't like the face.
[110:47.24]We're getting, we're changing it.
[110:58.03]All the way down.
[111:03.83]No, I don't like these half mouths either.
[111:12.24]You know what look what ends up working out Because it's just oh my god damn it.
[111:20.34]Why do they all have to work with this?
[111:21.96]It just works Fuck me they all have the same stupid face
[111:46.76]Okay.
[111:48.50]Cool.
[111:51.18]There it is.
[111:51.68]This is Zumbini.
[111:54.56]I can't change any color.
[111:56.62]That's it.
[111:57.13]Zumbini.
[111:57.61]Done.
[112:00.97]It's always duck.
[112:02.11]It's only duck.
[112:02.91]Always duck.
[112:06.37]But that looks like a fucking Zumbini.
[112:09.75]Ugh.
[112:16.20]No, go back.
[112:16.78]This is not John Smith.
[112:21.94]It's just a cupcake.
[112:23.04]It's a Goomba.
[112:24.28]I might as well make it and rename it a Goomba.
[112:33.79]Zumbini.
[112:35.87]That works.
[112:37.52]Junior.
[112:38.48]This is a female.
[112:40.48]America.
[112:42.08]That doesn't always matter.
[112:46.55]It's a mini-ville.
[112:49.43]I do need to... Where's the voice?
[112:57.36]Cupcake.
[112:58.98]It's just a Goomba.
[113:00.18]God damn it.
[113:15.85]What's a Goomba look like?
[113:22.03]Brown with the white.
[113:27.81]It's just a Goomba.
[113:29.39]We're going to correct it.
[113:30.90]Because that's just what this is.
[113:32.50]This is not a Zumbini.
[113:33.30]It's a fucking Goomba.
[113:38.06]Okay, they have the white eyes.
[113:39.56]They also have the teeth.
[113:40.46]I don't think I can do that though.
[113:41.62]I can't do shoes.
[113:48.46]Let's go back to chest.
[113:50.30]Just make this brown.
[113:54.29]There you go.
[113:54.71]There's your Gizugumba.
[113:56.23]There it is.
[114:02.71]It's a good- Super Mario Brothers!
[114:04.39]We all like that game!
[114:05.33]I'm just gonna call him Goombini.
[114:12.48]Goombiniville.
[114:13.28]That's fine.
[114:17.77]Drop that.
[114:23.35]200 pound Goomba.
[114:25.79]That's fucking terrifying.
[114:28.76]Save.
[114:31.20]Where is John Smith?
[114:32.78]There it is.
[114:34.32]Overwrite John Smith.
[114:36.98]Nickname Zumbini.
[114:37.72]It can still be a Zumbini.
[114:38.92]That's alright.
[114:42.02]Alright, we need two more, right?
[114:44.82]How many more do we need?
[114:45.52]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[114:47.47]Two more.
[114:49.01]And then we can finally fight.
[114:54.31]We can actually attack.
[114:55.63]And I'm not doing Guy Fieri.
[115:03.56]I'm sorry.
[115:04.20]It's not happening.
[115:10.24]Return to menu.
[115:14.90]I'm not gonna make, I've already done Garfield.
[115:21.16]Two more.
[115:24.16]Let's get creative here.
[115:25.90]I'm gonna name it right off the bat.
[115:27.52]We're gonna just put some stuff on his face.
[115:28.98]Gonna make him giant.
[115:32.13]And we're gonna do, just, give me some, let me start with the face.
[115:35.35]Start with the face.
[115:36.03]Improv, improv.
[115:37.33]Give me a spot.
[115:38.53]Give me a place, give me a noun, and give me an emotion.
[115:41.07]Let's go.
[115:41.43]Let's go with, um...
[115:44.16]Uh, uh, happy.
[115:45.24]Happy.
[115:45.78]Happy and we're at the, uh, we're at the zoo.
[115:47.68]Happy at the zoo and the emotion is happy.
[115:49.88]Okay.
[115:50.24]Happy at the zoo and we're happy.
[115:53.70]Got it.
[115:56.79]There we go.
[116:04.01]We can go all the way up.
[116:11.09]Works like this.
[116:15.63]Just like painting.
[116:18.36]We're not going to stop.
[116:19.04]We're going to see what it looks like when we're done.
[116:26.34]Honestly, I think this is just like a melted cream cheese.
[116:31.71]We're just making a cream cheese person.
[116:33.57]Like a whipped cream.
[116:36.19]I like it.
[116:38.63]Let's keep going.
[116:39.37]Let's see what happens when you make a total cream cheese person.
[116:47.15]Yeah, this is just like Mr. Caramel.
[116:49.77]Okay.
[116:59.72]Head.
[117:01.57]Uh, nope.
[117:02.79]Alright, we're kind of in turkey territory at the moment.
[117:10.27]I mean, we're in turkey territory.
[117:11.95]I don't want to make another turkey.
[117:13.73]Fucking goddammit.
[117:15.60]No more birds!
[117:29.25]Fuck me.
[117:29.81]It's gonna have to be a bird.
[117:34.63]What do you got for your arms?
[117:36.17]Upper arm.
[117:37.85]Forearm.
[117:38.95]Delete this.
[117:42.25]Make a Christmas turkey?
[117:43.45]Fine.
[117:45.29]We're already off the defense, so it don't matter.
[117:54.56]That's not what a turkey's feet look like.
[117:55.96]No, it's just gonna be like a naked guy.
[117:59.46]I don't care.
[118:02.32]Calf.
[118:06.00]In fact, I think we actually can get rid of the underwear.
[118:09.74]Yep.
[118:11.55]This is just... This is just pieces of meat.
[118:13.97]It's not even a turkey.
[118:17.01]This is just fucking meat, man.
[118:20.79]I'm gonna cover him in like blood.
[118:26.69]That's it.
[118:27.64]Yeah, it's gonna be meat, man.
[118:29.04]This is not a turkey anymore.
[118:35.32]No, you know what this guy's name... No, this is... This is gonna be the chewed gum.
[118:42.84]That's it.
[118:43.38]That's who it is.
[118:44.43]Got it.
[118:48.59]We're just gonna make him, like, green.
[118:53.29]Oh, fuck.
[118:55.09]Go back.
[119:01.47]Let's make him... Where's, like, his color?
[119:05.79]Yeah, what color gum should he be?
[119:07.99]Like, spearmint?
[119:08.91]There, there we go.
[119:12.25]There he is.
[119:12.61]He has fucking chewed up gum.
[119:15.74]We're gonna get rid of his feet too.
[119:16.80]They're just gonna be a mess.
[119:27.48]Pink?
[119:27.86]Should he be pink?
[119:32.16]Well, he's either Spearmint or he's like watermelon strawberry.
[119:35.67]He looks like a bunch of vape clouds.
[119:49.53]Alright, there is the chewed gum.
[119:54.42]What kind of fucking... It just doesn't work.
[119:59.38]There we go.
[120:04.74]Boxing?
[120:05.34]No, I like the mysterious better.
[120:10.70]Hands?
[120:11.08]No hands.
[120:14.21]There we go.
[120:15.79]I'm not doing anything else with this fucking loser.
[120:31.01]Shooed gum.
[120:34.41]Worst character ever.
[120:37.83]Where are his voices?
[120:39.87]Male.
[120:40.49]Who knows?
[120:41.45]Could be.
[120:43.49]Is it like just an unknown?
[120:46.87]And birthplace?
[120:47.45]Who knows?
[120:48.25]Who cares?
[120:53.53]Is it a skill?
[120:54.98]There it is.
[121:02.12]Look at how many of these there are.
[121:06.39]Wait, is there like a, like you got chewed up or something?
[121:10.47]Kaboom.
[121:11.03]One more time.
[121:12.01]One, two, three.
[121:13.25]You moron.
[121:15.49]What?
[121:17.59]Hell yeah.
[121:18.25]Welcome, welcome.
[121:19.15]Thank you very much.
[121:20.27]Sumo salutations.
[121:21.41]Okay.
[121:22.46]Cut the shit.
[121:25.78]Oh, fuck you.
[121:26.60]How many are there?
[121:34.89]Way too many voice lines.
[121:36.33]You're dead.
[121:37.55]Cut the shit.
[121:38.05]You're dead.
[121:38.47]Let's go.
[121:38.95]Finish your laugh.
[121:41.63]Oh, bark.
[121:44.44]Oh boy.
[121:45.18]Okay, bark has to be one.
[121:47.94]For sure.
[121:52.04]How many of these are there?
[121:54.90]You're dead meat.
[121:56.53]Are you ready?
[121:57.11]Okay, baby.
[121:59.60]Oh, we're at number one.
[122:00.34]Bang, bang.
[122:00.92]Oh, no.
[122:01.24]Feel the power.
[122:02.58]Ready?
[122:02.88]Go.
[122:03.30]What?
[122:04.14]Gah-ha-ha-humming.
[122:05.07]Ooh.
[122:05.49]Meow.
[122:05.89]Bark.
[122:07.77]Roar.
[122:09.57]No.
[122:10.93]I can't preview these either.
[122:12.39]They don't do anything.
[122:19.30]Tough, wild.
[122:20.22]Let's go with a saying.
[122:23.94]Thank you very much.
[122:26.02]Cut the shit.
[122:27.02]Let's go with bark and cut the shit.
[122:29.26]Sounds good to me.
[122:32.74]Let's see what he says.
[122:34.67]No, it's in Japanese.
[122:36.67]Go back.
[122:37.09]I don't want him to scream.
[122:39.33]I want him to hear what he has to say.
[122:54.45]Does the American male say it too?
[123:00.24]Wow, wow, wow.
[123:01.16]Okay, what?
[123:02.36]Meow, bark, howl.
[123:03.36]No.
[123:03.52]Let's do ready, go.
[123:07.56]And we're going to get American male again.
[123:13.60]Wild eight.
[123:14.56]Let's try these.
[123:17.46]Ready, go!
[123:17.93]Ready, go!
[123:18.65]Hee!
[123:19.11]Hee!
[123:31.62]What do you guys want to get eliminated first?
[123:33.51]I wonder what you guys are gonna want to happen to this guy.
[123:42.87]Even when the guy walks, he's gonna make this noise.
[124:06.93]No, his taunts have to be ready to kill.
[124:09.40]Okay, there we go.
[124:12.88]Let's make him fairly terrible so he doesn't stay in for very long.
[124:18.06]Should we make him just unkillable?
[124:19.12]It's gonna be real rough.
[124:26.18]Very entertaining.
[124:26.90]This is defense.
[124:37.56]Why?
[124:38.70]Uh, this is all- look at- look at- okay, think of how many- how much time that I've been here doing this.
[124:44.81]How- what's it been, like, over two hours?
[124:47.27]Yeah, it's been over two hours of me making these stupid characters in this fucking video game.
[124:55.08]This shit- this shit ain't gonna be worth it, guys.
[124:59.64]I just dropped the controller.
[125:01.04]I- I haven't used the controller in so long that it just fell on the fucking ground.
[125:08.48]Give it max stretch.
[125:11.64]Hold on.
[125:14.92]I'm not... That's gonna get old really fucking quickly.
[125:23.23]Oh my god, this is gonna get so fucking old.
[125:37.13]You guys are gonna hate this.
[125:38.37]I hate this already.
[125:41.53]Ready?
[125:41.73]Go!
[125:41.81]Ready?
[125:42.13]Go!
[125:42.25]Go!
[125:42.55]Go!
[125:42.81]Go!
[125:43.17]Go!
[125:43.35]Go!
[125:43.71]Ready?
[125:43.87]Go!
[125:44.19]Go!
[125:44.63]Ready?
[125:45.27]Go!
[125:55.67]Elbow butt.
[125:58.81]Justify.
[125:59.23]I gotta get out of here.
[126:01.11]Save.
[126:01.63]Chewed gum.
[126:02.31]Parts unknown.
[126:03.35]There he is.
[126:03.87]Save him.
[126:05.92]Jesus Christ.
[126:10.52]Alright.
[126:11.18]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[126:12.24]One more character and we're done.
[126:15.22]Here we go.
[126:16.00]Last character.
[126:16.72]Who's it gonna be?
[126:17.59]Let's place your bets.
[126:19.23]Let me place your bets.
[126:20.01]It's me making them.
[126:21.98]I'm like spinning a roulette wheel.
[126:23.12]I'm making characters in a fucking dumb video game.
[126:25.00]Alright.
[126:26.07]From blank.
[126:30.49]Hmm.
[126:35.43]I have to think about this here.
[126:43.25]Christopher Walken.
[126:44.09]Why would I think Christopher Walken?
[126:48.66]SpongeBob.
[126:49.18]SpongeBob ain't gonna work.
[126:54.81]Like a stool.
[126:55.49]A stool actually would work pretty well.
[126:58.89]Or just a piece of furniture.
[127:00.59]I like the furniture angle.
[127:03.65]You're starting to get in my brain there with the furniture angle.
[127:05.33]Like a chair or a sofa.
[127:08.37]Mr. Sofa?
[127:09.65]Sean Sofa.
[127:11.75]Or like a Chris chair.
[127:17.53]Sean Sofa sounds pretty good.
[127:22.53]I think it'll work.
[127:23.59]Let's find out.
[127:27.58]I know exactly how to make this.
[127:35.35]Make Guy Fieri on the sofa.
[127:38.23]That actually is possible.
[127:39.91]That's possible.
[127:41.59]Hold that thought.
[127:42.49]We're going to have Guy Fieri sitting on a couch.
[127:44.23]It's going to be the next character.
[127:45.31]We're going to try.
[127:49.55]I'm going to give it my absolute hardest try here.
[127:52.15]Guy Fieri sitting in a chair.
[127:57.72]That was his arms.
[128:04.58]I'm going to end up making the guy from Get Over It.
[128:08.12]That's who this is going to end up being.
[128:09.16]Okay, shrink that down.
[128:13.50]I've got to get the head back, but we'll do that in a minute.
[128:16.20]So thigh, this is going to be the legs of the chair.
[128:17.99]I'm going to get rid of the feet and the calves.
[128:22.57]So this is going to be just like a couch.
[128:32.32]Let's get the chair done first.
[128:35.44]Before we do anything else.
[128:39.14]Okay, so... Let's go with... Waste.
[128:47.51]Okay.
[128:48.17]That's not alright.
[128:48.87]We need to add something here to make it look like a chair.
[128:52.23]That looks pretty good.
[128:54.95]No?
[128:56.95]Yeah.
[128:59.41]That might be perfect, though.
[129:01.88]We have to get the idea that those aren't his legs.
[129:08.19]Maybe I can add extra legs.
[129:11.97]Those look like extra legs to me.
[129:16.13]No, they're not on the back.
[129:22.99]I mean, that's kind of like a sofa.
[129:24.37]That's just like a stool.
[129:28.60]Guy Fieri sitting in the stool?
[129:30.58]I think it might work.
[129:35.72]No.
[129:36.22]Not a diaper boy.
[129:37.90]No.
[129:43.59]These could pass as legs.
[129:47.21]Let's see if I can handle this.
[129:59.18]Separate that shit.
[130:02.94]Okay.
[130:06.00]That's looking alright.
[130:07.30]Those are the legs of the chair.
[130:08.72]This is Guy Fieri.
[130:10.62]Why does it have to be fucking Guy Fieri?
[130:14.70]No, I'm going to have to change this.
[130:15.76]These are Guy Fieri's legs.
[130:17.59]Stop calling it Guy Fieri because it's not going to be fucking Guy Fieri.
[130:21.75]There you go.
[130:22.49]There's his legs.
[130:24.79]Let's go ahead and go back to here.
[130:34.01]No, that just looks like his arms.
[130:40.08]That doesn't look like legs.
[130:41.94]Those are his arms.
[130:43.40]His arms are going through and that's it.
[130:58.21]Now it works.
[130:59.17]Because those are his legs back there.
[131:02.15]You see them?
[131:02.81]See this?
[131:06.63]Guy Fieri is just tiny.
[131:08.01]That's all we need to know.
[131:08.74]Alright, there you go.
[131:09.30]The legs work.
[131:09.90]Let's get the thighs bigger.
[131:14.54]That looks okay.
[131:19.03]From the back, he's not going to look right, but that's okay.
[131:25.45]He just has tiny feet.
[131:26.49]Alright, that's fine.
[131:27.78]Face.
[131:34.36]Okay, fucking Guy Fieri.
[131:36.70]I'm not even, I'm not spending any time on this fucking stupid thing.
[131:41.24]I'm going right to it.
[131:42.26]I'm just gonna just guess and see where the hell it is.
[131:44.21]There it is.
[131:46.71]Doesn't even fit his head.
[131:50.55]He's got kind of a fat face.
[131:55.83]Like a Guy Fieri face.
[131:56.99]That's kind of, that's pretty good.
[131:58.27]This is pretty good.
[132:02.52]I like this one.
[132:03.80]Face 6552.
[132:12.15]No, this is way better.
[132:15.53]Way fucking better.
[132:16.29]Alright, I got it.
[132:18.63]It's already, here it is.
[132:21.81]Oh, come on.
[132:23.61]Really?
[132:23.97]Really?
[132:27.19]Give me a break.
[132:29.03]He needs, like, glasses on his head, and that'll fix it.
[132:36.42]He's that goatee.
[132:39.74]He's that killer goatee, man.
[132:42.09]That's close.
[132:47.03]That's not close.
[132:48.51]Neither is that.
[132:49.07]It is.
[132:53.61]I can't.
[132:54.00]Why am I doing fucking Guy Fieri?
[132:57.20]This is so dumb.
[132:58.20]What a terrible last character to make.
[132:59.82]He wears like Hawaiian shirts, right?
[133:13.81]Here we go.
[133:17.25]What does he wear?
[133:17.83]Like, he wears these, doesn't he?
[133:22.56]That's alright here.
[133:24.10]Right here.
[133:25.08]On Triple D. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[133:28.70]We're at a joint in South Kentucky.
[133:35.34]Guaranteed to shit your pants.
[133:36.70]Here we go.
[133:49.14]This just looks so incorrect.
[133:52.60]That's not even Guy- and we're done!
[133:54.84]And we're done.
[133:56.31]Gonna give him a t-shirt and we're done.
[134:01.49]This is not Guy Fieri sitting in a stool.
[134:03.79]This is Guy Fieri with leather pants on.
[134:07.17]That's it.
[134:09.64]Here we go.
[134:10.12]Does it make it the same color as his hair?
[134:16.02]Yeah, he wears like wild shirts, doesn't he?
[134:24.05]Whatever, there he is, this Guy Fieri.
[134:30.13]This doesn't work at all.
[134:33.46]This is supposed to be his legs.
[134:41.78]He's large.
[134:43.77]He's actually really big.
[134:51.28]It's just good bacon on a tray.
[134:53.48]It is kind of Guy Fieri.
[134:54.52]This is like fucking bacon dinner.
[134:56.00]Alright, there he is.
[135:00.50]Done.
[135:04.36]Rest in name.
[135:05.03]Guy Fieri.
[135:12.55]God damn it.
[135:16.19]It's like Fiera, right?
[135:17.95]Class, you can be junior.
[135:20.21]Male.
[135:21.67]I gotta have, is it like, there's like a one, two, three, right?
[135:24.28]Like, one, two, three!
[135:26.04]Triple D. We have to get one, two, three.
[135:32.28]Let's do, it's one, two, three is what we need.
[135:36.00]Or is there like a, he says like a bunch of dumb shit.
[135:39.36]Bow, bow.
[135:40.52]Fuh, uh, ha, we, yes.
[135:43.09]Yeah.
[135:44.09]Oh yeah, come on.
[135:46.40]You're dead meat.
[135:48.20]Viva Mexico.
[135:50.44]Okay, baby, sounds pretty good.
[135:52.07]I think he says that kind of shit.
[135:55.15]Let's go with American Male 5.
[135:56.63]Wow, wow, wow.
[136:02.92]Sounds pretty good, but... Number 1?
[136:05.86]Oh, that's number 1.
[136:06.88]Oh, man, it's out of the park.
[136:08.76]How come there's no out of the park?
[136:16.00]No.
[136:18.32]I think I'm gonna have to go with number one.
[136:22.80]Press X, it doesn't do anything.
[136:24.12]And X on the controller doesn't do anything either.
[136:26.93]Unfortunately, I would.
[136:28.61]Number one.
[136:29.61]Okay, well, it's actually square.
[136:33.09]Number one.
[136:34.61]Okay, baby.
[136:35.51]Okay, baby.
[136:38.81]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[136:40.73]No, that's the wrong voice.
[136:43.69]Shoot.
[136:44.59]No, not enough.
[136:50.06]No.
[136:50.72]Uh, I'm gonna say he's probably like... Let's go with American Male 6.
[137:00.31]Is OK Baby fine?
[137:01.19]No, that's... That's good.
[137:15.52]Alright, how about this one?
[137:17.56]Nope.
[137:21.36]Pretty close.
[137:27.10]I've heard him say that on a show before.
[137:28.45]What?
[137:29.27]He's like a Mexican joint.
[137:44.73]Okay, baby.
[137:46.37]Okay, baby.
[137:47.45]That's just gonna be... That's just gonna be Cookie Monster and then this guy.
[137:52.99]Okay, baby.
[137:53.85]I should make Cookie Monster.
[137:55.86]Okay, baby.
[137:57.32]Okay, baby.
[137:59.40]Why the fucking Cookie Monster?
[138:01.22]Wow, wow, wow.
[138:04.10]Oh, dude, cookies.
[138:05.66]Finish!
[138:07.40]Okay, baby.
[138:08.41]Okay, baby.
[138:09.71]That works.
[138:12.90]I wish we could have nine.
[138:13.92]I would just make Cookie Monster.
[138:18.72]I just spit everywhere.
[138:26.24]Alright.
[138:26.82]God damn it.
[138:27.28]These are fine.
[138:32.00]Finish it and end it and let's fucking watch, please.
[138:34.74]This is gonna be such a waste of time.
[138:43.10]Let's make the Cookie Monster.
[138:44.74]Who is he gonna replace?
[138:45.84]Looks like a bizarro Doom guy.
[138:53.84]Alright, moves.
[138:57.68]Okay, baby.
[138:59.82]Okay, baby.
[139:00.30]Okay, baby.
[139:01.68]Okay, baby.
[139:02.86]Okay, baby.
[139:04.20]He's gonna be so annoying.
[139:06.51]Okay, baby.
[139:07.73]Okay, baby.
[139:08.85]Okay, baby.
[139:10.27]Okay, baby.
[139:10.97]Okay, baby.
[139:11.83]Okay, baby.
[139:14.36]This is gonna be so annoying.
[139:17.36]I'm not doing this, guys.
[139:21.25]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[139:22.49]We're out.
[139:23.73]I'm not doing this shit.
[139:27.07]You guys understand that this is going to blow your eardrums out because everybody just doesn't ever shut the fuck up when they're gonna be... No one's gonna ever stop talking.
[139:38.77]Actually, isn't it TT?
[139:39.59]It's Guy Fieri.
[139:42.75]Not Fiera.
[139:44.14]I don't give a shit if I'm plainly honest.
[139:50.30]Here we go.
[139:54.64]It's time.
[139:56.82]Well, let's just go with a straight up Battle Royale.
[140:02.37]First win endless over the rope.
[140:03.97]I don't even know who's on what team.
[140:13.46]Alright, there's me.
[140:14.54]Let's go with... I'm gonna go all the way down.
[140:18.35]I gotta get me.
[140:22.09]Where the fuck am I?
[140:23.41]There I am.
[140:23.75]Okay, I got me.
[140:27.03]And then we're going down again.
[140:28.23]Chewed gum.
[140:33.55]Iron giant.
[140:34.91]This is my team.
[140:35.61]I like the iron giant, like chewed gum, and I like... This is the worst fucking character.
[140:42.81]And I want the fucking magician hands.
[140:46.18]I want the invisible man.
[140:48.98]Versus... Uh... Goombinieville.
[140:57.72]Seagull.
[140:58.72]All the fucking birds are on that team.
[141:00.20]Get out of here.
[141:00.92]Fuck the birds.
[141:05.36]Donald Duck.
[141:08.02]It's Team Bird.
[141:12.59]Who else am I missing?
[141:15.65]Oh, and Guy Fieri.
[141:16.47]I don't want Guy Fieri on my team.
[141:17.67]I like this.
[141:20.79]Let's go with referee.
[141:22.87]Is it going to be useless?
[141:25.97]I think that's the weird anime girl.
[141:28.65]Win condition three.
[141:29.73]This is not how this works.
[141:33.29]No, we're not doing 800 speed.
[141:37.49]Critical.
[141:37.91]This is fine.
[141:38.62]I think I know how to play this game.
[141:42.75]I'm ready to go.
[141:45.23]Over the top rope.
[141:51.81]Three, two, one, let's go.
[141:56.41]It's so it begins.
[141:58.13]Where am I?
[142:09.71]Wait, these guys are supposed to be on my team.
[142:12.27]No one's on any team.
[142:12.91]I get it, alright.
[142:14.31]It really is just like everyone running around for themselves.
[142:17.61]Okay, baby.
[142:20.97]Okay, baby.
[142:22.52]Okay, baby.
[142:23.38]Why did I just fall down?
[142:24.40]Okay, baby.
[142:25.50]Okay, baby.
[142:27.08]Hey, Donald's like he's already eliminated.
[142:40.04]What do I have?
[142:40.70]I have a goomba.
[142:42.51]So many people are on different, like, sea levels.
[142:47.89]Everyone's on different levels.
[142:53.99]I can't even tell who's who.
[142:56.08]Are we doing two?
[142:56.82]We're doing a double fucking powerbomb against Fiora.
[142:59.94]Alright, that worked.
[143:00.64]I'm gonna make it out alive on this one, guys.
[143:05.10]Garen fucking deep.
[143:15.93]I got it!
[143:17.07]Shit, I missed.
[143:19.43]Why did Donald Duck get instantly eliminated?
[143:21.83]This is just a fucking nightmare, man.
[143:27.98]I don't even know... How do I even eliminate you?
[143:32.20]I just got really close.
[143:33.30]I just got fucking... Are you serious?
[143:49.04]Oh gosh, the area's gonna be gone here in a second.
[143:52.48]I just gotta flame it down.
[143:53.76]This is fucking terrible.
[144:00.73]I'll see you later, Goomba!
[144:01.89]Goomba just got eliminated by the, uh, invisible man.
[144:15.81]Throw him.
[144:17.23]This is so, oh my god it's loud.
[144:19.51]I'm so sorry.
[144:21.57]I didn't know it was that loud.
[144:23.39]Somebody getting pinned in a Royal Rumble.
[144:32.09]You can't even tell who the invisible man is.
[144:33.89]See you later Guy Fieri, you're out.
[144:35.45]Nope, nope, nope, we're okay.
[144:39.23]Who's giving up?
[144:46.92]He just jumped off the top rope.
[144:49.01]Ugh, this is too much for me to even understand.
[144:56.81]He just got kicked in the balls.
[145:01.52]Ugh, Invisible Man's gonna win.
[145:04.32]He has the heart.
[145:07.60]He has the wherewithal.
[145:09.92]No, I don't know.
[145:10.58]This might go on for a long time.
[145:13.20]Him jumping off the top ropes is perfect.
[145:16.74]It's just a mess of colors at this point.
[145:20.93]Well, no, no, no.
[145:22.35]Chewed gum, gonna take a ride, no?
[145:26.17]Can I just say the Iron Giant is the worst character.
[145:29.75]By far.
[145:32.08]That was just clearly, look at me, I'm gonna put sliders up and down.
[145:35.65]Guy Fieri just almost got pinned.
[145:41.57]That was a double powerbomb, I liked it.
[145:47.01]Alright, that's like Dale from fucking King of the Hill.
[145:50.36]It's not even Guy Fieri.
[145:52.88]No, no, I mean Boom Power.
[145:56.10]Iron Giant with a couple of quick right kicks there.
[146:00.41]I can't even commentate this.
[146:02.83]I can't even talk over this.
[146:06.24]Why did I get eliminated first?
[146:08.22]No, Donald Dun- Nope.
[146:12.62]Invisible Man is still in it.
[146:14.78]So there's submissions too.
[146:18.36]What is the door- what is the seagull doing?
[146:19.66]The seagull is just done shaking his head back and forth.
[146:38.53]I get it.
[146:40.54]When he was just punching the Seagull in the face.
[146:43.48]Oh, that's great.
[146:48.76]It was worth it.
[146:49.62]It was worth two hours.
[146:50.66]I think it really was worth two hours.
[146:59.34]Ten minutes?
[147:00.08]Was this Iron Chef?
[147:02.30]Ten minutes have elapsed.
[147:03.66]Is somebody gonna get chopped?
[147:08.28]Jesus Christ.
[147:11.02]Zinko just ran into somebody.
[147:12.47]Didn't even attempt to attack someone.
[147:15.07]He's gonna do it again.
[147:17.11]No.
[147:17.75]Who's give... Oh, no.
[147:18.55]Forget it.
[147:18.83]The invisible man.
[147:23.87]Can I, like, come back in?
[147:27.14]I can't do anything.
[147:28.82]He's being dragged in the middle of the ring.
[147:30.16]He's gonna get pinned.
[147:31.26]I think our hero's gonna go for a pin here.
[147:39.28]Can somebody lose so we can do something else?
[147:43.46]Oh, risky move on the top rope there, Seagull.
[147:47.82]That's not a position you want to be in.
[147:51.81]Guy Fieri's gone.
[147:55.37]Nope.
[147:59.03]Those two kicks were perfect.
[148:03.01]Those two, like, stock audio footage kicks.
[148:14.90]This is the life of a fucking living joke.
[148:20.34]What is that?
[148:21.58]The invisible man's lying on the ground.
[148:29.49]They're stuck here for an eternity.
[148:32.47]No one's ever gonna make it out of here.
[148:46.26]Invisible Man fell out of the ring.
[148:49.38]Oh, my fucking face hurts.
[148:52.62]Invisible Man's gone.
[148:54.78]He accidentally fell out of the ring.
[148:57.49]Who's gonna last the longest?
[148:58.79]I wonder.
[149:00.77]Who's screaming?
[149:01.69]It's the Chewed Gum.
[149:06.87]It's the Chewed Gum and Guy Fieri.
[149:08.65]They're the ones that won't shut the fuck up.
[149:19.29]Oh, here comes a double powerbomb!
[149:22.41]The Iron Giant better not win.
[149:24.31]He's the worst.
[149:30.29]I'm putting my money on Seagull.
[149:32.85]I think that's who I think is going to win this.
[149:35.12]Before somebody falls out of the ring, watch out.
[149:37.06]The corner is the place you don't want to be.
[149:41.46]So exhausted.
[149:43.72]There goes Guy Fieri.
[149:45.00]Nope.
[149:45.68]All of them are thinking about going on the top ropes.
[149:53.67]Watch out, watch out!
[149:59.45]Why do they keep doing that?
[150:04.25]This has been going on for 16 fucking minutes, guys.
[150:09.43]I did not think this was going to be going on this long.
[150:13.35]We have to get a winner, though.
[150:14.67]This has to end.
[150:15.51]I thought he just jumped out of the ring.
[150:19.63]I was about to fucking cry.
[150:24.16]He's not going to do it again, is he?
[150:26.18]He's going to have to sleep a whole... Nope.
[150:33.18]The timer is going fast?
[150:34.76]Oh, it actually is.
[150:38.08]This is like double time.
[150:39.86]It's been going on for about nine minutes so far, right?
[150:42.85]I've lost all track of time.
[150:46.67]The top rope maneuver.
[150:48.37]I don't even know he got that.
[150:51.99]Get rid of Guy Fieri.
[150:53.96]Get rid of him.
[150:58.25]Are we really going to be here for this long?
[151:00.95]We picked him up to say, I'm tired.
[151:10.73]It's a get.
[151:16.28]Alright, whoever wins gets deleted.
[151:18.88]That's how this works.
[151:26.13]Bet $1,000 on it.
[151:26.67]Alright, we got a poll.
[151:27.85]What do you guys think of it?
[151:29.17]Let's see.
[151:31.15]Let's take a look at this poll that Holy Mac did today.
[151:33.83]Let's see what you guys say.
[151:39.68]Chewed up gum.
[151:40.16]I'm seeing chewed up gum.
[151:42.84]Chewed up gum looks like it's the favorite.
[151:48.81]They just keep doing double power bombs.
[151:54.10]Somebody else get eliminated.
[151:55.74]20 minutes have gone by.
[151:58.76]Is there a time limit?
[152:01.52]There might be a time limit here.
[152:02.82]Oh, see you later.
[152:03.62]Bye.
[152:04.94]That's it for you.
[152:05.74]Bye, Seagull.
[152:08.02]It was that easy, apparently.
[152:09.22]You just have to push them down into the... Somebody's bleeding.
[152:16.93]Who's bleeding?
[152:18.85]Oh, it's the Jewel God.
[152:25.91]The chewed-up gum is bleeding.
[152:39.60]Get rid of Guy Fieri, please!
[152:42.12]You know, I am rooting for the chewed-up gum.
[152:45.34]He's taking so much damage.
[152:48.47]He's been doing all the moves.
[152:50.35]He's doing all the penis kicks.
[152:52.49]He's perfect.
[152:57.50]There we go!
[152:58.18]See you later!
[152:59.45]And here comes the end!
[153:04.15]No!
[153:16.10]He went to check a photo.
[153:40.30]Why did they run into each other?
[153:42.24]Powerbomb over the ring!
[153:50.47]He killed him.
[153:52.09]He killed him.
[153:54.75]I don't know if I can take this.
[154:03.77]He literally died.
[154:05.19]He killed him.
[154:09.08]Donald Duck was in it for 56 seconds.
[154:12.53]I was in it for three minutes and then Iron Giant was fucking murdered.
[154:16.87]Dude, that would have been so perfect though.
[154:20.47]That jumping dive after the elimination to the pin would have been fucking perfect.
[154:26.51]Oh, man.
[154:28.67]Okay.
[154:33.92]I have to delete.
[154:35.00]No, I can't.
[154:36.24]After that kind of performance, I can't delete them.
[154:41.00]You know what?
[154:41.56]Because he knew he was going up against deletion.
[154:44.30]So he killed the Iron Giant.
[154:46.88]So the Iron Giant is dead.
[154:48.56]So he negated his deletion by killing the Iron Giant.
[154:52.53]So the Iron Giant gets deleted.
[154:53.77]Now I'm going to go back.
[154:58.41]We're going to make one more character.
[154:59.51]Because the Iron Giant's gone.
[155:02.83]Oh my lord.
[155:03.57]Well, should we just see what the fuck this even means?
[155:07.21]What's the landmine match?
[155:08.75]Let's just...
[155:10.53]We have to do it.
[155:12.63]We just have to see what it is, you know?
[155:13.97]Like, just do fucking landmines.
[155:15.93]What does that even mean?
[155:17.73]Why is there a landmine mode?
[155:21.68]Ugh.
[155:23.32]No, we gotta make this right.
[155:24.76]I'll make another character.
[155:27.86]Gruesome fighting.
[155:29.30]Cage match.
[155:29.94]There's a potential for a lot here.
[155:36.28]So, let's get rid of the Iron Giant, because he's dead.
[155:39.69]He was killed on camera.
[155:41.49]On screen.
[155:43.59]My fucking throat hurts.
[155:45.89]Okay, wrestler edit.
[155:46.67]Let's make another guy.

[155:56.16]I have no idea.
[155:59.80]Let's go.
[156:00.20]Let's just be creative here.
[156:03.43]Does this count as a rumble?

[160:57.47]It's coming together.
[160:58.99]He doesn't have anything on his arms.

[165:20.68]Alright, there we go.
[165:24.80]This Wolverine?
[165:27.94]God, Wolverine might be worse than the Iron Giant.
[165:32.74]What's his last name?

[166:35.74]Logan was his login.
[166:37.22]Alright, he's got good punch skills.
[166:42.35]All this matters.
[166:47.41]The one thing we will say, he's very rough.
[166:55.45]I don't think he's that entertaining, but people will disagree.
[166:57.60]I really don't think he's that entertaining.
[167:02.38]Scratch.
[167:04.14]A lot of points left over.
[167:05.10]Alright.
[167:06.14]We've got to give him some grunts.

[168:43.94]He's getting renamed to Wolverine Wilson.
[168:47.18]Alright, we're done.
[168:54.56]Get out.
[168:55.20]Wolverine Wilson.
[169:14.82]He's good.
[169:16.12]He's missing a little bit.
[169:17.01]He's missing some assets, but that's fine.
[169:19.93]Wolverine.
[169:21.69]Wolverine Wilson.
[169:26.39]Alright, let's make these guys fight with landmines.

[170:27.17]Wolverine, Seagull.
[170:33.47]Guy Fieri.
[170:37.97]Forgot to save.
[170:38.66]What are you talking about?
[170:41.72]Iron Giant's dead.
[170:42.54]Donald Duck.
[170:43.00]I don't want Donald Duck.
[170:43.66]We'll have the magician over here.
[170:44.68]Why do I keep saying that?
[170:47.14]Okay.
[170:48.12]So now we need... Doug?
[170:53.88]I think Grimace.
[170:56.60]Actually, Grimace is a really good idea.
[170:58.02]Chewed Gum.
[170:59.30]Our returning champion.
[171:05.72]Uh, Goombiniville, I'm deleting Goombiniville next just because it's, it's a Goombiniville, it's, it's terrible.
[171:16.16]Uh, okay.
[171:17.66]What are we missing here?
[171:20.98]What am I missing?
[171:29.27]Why don't, why don't I, I like made them all stupid fucking first and last names.
[171:35.55]I wish I could just go to only created characters.
[171:38.37]Donald Duck.
[171:41.63]And who's the last one?
[171:46.59]Wait, I have to be in it, don't I?
[171:47.83]Yeah, I do.
[171:54.57]Alright.
[171:58.05]Here we go.
[171:59.03]So this is... Referee is going to be this same one.
[172:06.12]settings corner options barbed wire fluorescent lamp okay wind condition is a three count speed 100 rope on lumber tornado cut play critical wouldn't they just die we're about to find out here we go good luck everybody start the match
[172:38.56]Alright, where are the landmines?
[172:41.80]There's just barbed wire tables everywhere.
[172:44.67]Are the landmines just in the ring?
[172:54.56]Where are the landmines?
[172:55.74]I don't see any landmines.
[173:03.52]Okay, landmines are outside, and he just got exploded by a landmine on the table.
[173:11.00]He's perfectly fucking fine.
[173:12.42]That was so stupid.
[173:23.64]How do you even lose?
[173:27.12]This is awful.
[173:30.06]So if you get thrown outside, you explode, but it doesn't even kill you.
[173:36.54]Look at this.
[173:38.14]Seagull's face.
[173:45.08]Seagull got busted wide open.
[173:50.13]There goes the pin.
[173:56.19]No, only on one count.
[173:57.39]Everyone's face is gonna be bleeding after this.
[174:00.14]We're gonna have a gruesome match next.
[174:07.92]Oh, there it is.
[174:08.95]Into the glass.
[174:10.81]Guy Fieri's getting choked out.
[174:11.73]I'm choking out Guy Fieri.
[174:13.31]Oh, he reversed it.
[174:14.01]I want someone else to get thrown over.
[174:19.08]Why don't limbs come off?
[174:21.26]They probably do.
[174:21.90]They might.
[174:22.76]This game's so weird.
[174:26.31]Nice.
[174:26.69]Nice reversal by Donald Duck.
[174:30.76]Who's pinning who?
[174:31.32]Oh, I forgot the invisible man was even still in there.
[174:33.60]What is happening?
[174:38.12]He's like putting his foot to his face.
[174:39.82]That's like his submission move.
[174:46.25]There's just blood everywhere.
[174:48.39]Oh, there's another explosion!
[174:51.33]Guy Fieri just went and thrown over the ropes.
[174:53.77]It's okay though, if you step on a fucking landmine, you're gonna be fine.
[175:03.10]Uh, 2.9.
[175:03.58]I almost got pinned by the Invisible Man.
[175:08.69]That was a tenth of a second off.
[175:12.93]Another pin.
[175:16.65]Nope.
[175:16.95]Why is Submissions even allowed when you can die from explosions?
[175:25.75]Who's being pinned over there?
[175:26.85]I don't know.
[175:27.19]2.9 again.
[175:28.79]I kind of regret making this referee this slow.
[175:35.99]This is never gonna end.
[175:37.41]Unless somebody dies.
[175:39.82]Remember, if you die in the game... If you die in the game, you die in real life.
[175:44.76]If you die, it's over.
[175:45.66]You're dead.
[175:45.96]You're deleted.
[175:53.17]I wish it was actually landmines inside the ring.
[176:02.32]I'm just lying on the ground.
[176:07.98]Bloody face.
[176:09.90]And who else is gonna get exploded?
[176:17.91]No one, apparently.
[176:18.75]I'm just gonna run back and forth against the ropes.
[176:27.19]Alright, come on.
[176:28.01]Somebody do something.
[176:30.86]Somebody do anything.
[176:32.20]Besides punching each other in the face.
[176:39.22]Oh, man.
[176:42.64]What's the invisible man doing?
[176:47.62]Powerbomb.
[176:48.24]Everyone's tired again.
[176:50.70]I forgot what team everyone was on.
[176:53.73]You don't even need to know.
[176:54.69]I don't think there are teams.
[176:59.36]There's no rhyme or reason to anything that's going on.
[177:03.60]I'm just waiting for the next explosion.
[177:04.90]I'm waiting for somebody to die outside.
[177:06.37]It might happen.
[177:08.31]Somebody's gonna die outside.
[177:11.73]And remember, they're dead in real life.
[177:19.35]Somebody's gonna die outside.
[177:23.03]There's too many people bleeding.
[177:25.54]Too many submissions going on at the same time.
[177:27.58]Keep track ref, come on.
[177:35.25]Please, somebody get... Is it elimination or... Hold on.
[177:40.01]If somebody pins somebody, do they just win?
[177:41.73]I think they might just win the match.
[177:45.91]That's why everyone's going for pins.
[177:56.72]I just have a migraine.
[177:57.70]That's how I feel right now.
[177:59.22]Come on.
[178:00.70]Outside.
[178:01.66]Throw him outside.
[178:02.36]We want to see another explosion.
[178:08.53]Outside.
[178:12.07]Reverse it.
[178:12.53]Throw him outside.
[178:16.31]Somebody get fucking killed.
[178:27.66]Uh-oh, nice running clothesline there.
[178:29.18]A lot of people in the corner.
[178:31.14]There's a lot of potential for... We're gonna pin.
[178:36.40]Donald Duck pin on Guy Fieri!
[178:39.81]Uh-oh, 2.9.
[178:41.57]It's 2.9 every time apparently.
[178:47.85]I love when they just run into each other.
[178:50.09]Is this a triple powerbomb?
[178:51.37]No.
[178:52.07]They're both...
[179:01.16]Oh, God.
[179:03.26]Somebody end this shit.
[179:07.32]Somebody end this, please.
[179:09.36]Do you know that there's explosives outside?
[179:17.77]There are explosive devices outside.
[179:27.06]God.
[179:39.58]This is taking too long.
[179:43.64]That was three people.
[179:50.35]I'm hoping for a pin situation.
[179:56.54]Nope, that was a one count break.
[180:00.00]If somebody dies, it's over, I think.
[180:08.42]I don't... This is not elimination.
[180:10.00]This is if you die, you die.
[180:11.94]And then they have to stop the match if somebody died.
[180:14.14]This is... I'm ready to leave.
[180:25.21]Leave.
[180:25.41]How did the rumble take... not as much time as this?
[180:39.05]Please.
[180:40.87]This has to be ending soon, right?
[180:45.30]There's nothing even left to say.
[180:50.80]Wolverine's pinning someone.
[180:52.24]That's it.
[180:52.62]Game over.
[180:53.30]Wolverine wins.
[180:55.88]Wolverine wins the match.
[180:57.22]It's over.
[181:01.54]Yeah.
[181:02.04]Wolverine wins.
[181:03.82]Goombini dies.
[181:05.22]He's dead.
[181:11.67]Congratulations.
[181:15.97]Zumbini now gets flushed down the toilet.
[181:22.78]Hold on, though.
[181:25.42]Lumber is on.
[181:26.28]Tornado on.
[181:27.52]Let's make our own rules here.
[181:28.97]I want to try something real quick.
[181:30.07]Hold on.
[181:32.45]Let's go to gruesome match.
[181:35.31]Gruesome match.
[181:39.49]Settings.
[181:41.19]Time.
[181:42.71]Give up only.
[181:46.55]No, there's no weapons here.
[181:50.13]It's only... You can only make people give up.
[181:52.26]That's it.
[181:53.84]Carousel match sounds pretty dumb.
[181:57.88]We need to enable weapons.
[182:01.68]Barbed wire deathmatch?
[182:02.98]Cage deathmatch?
[182:05.86]Let's see if we can enable weapons here.
[182:08.44]Wind condition, escape.
[182:10.54]Oh boy, this is going to be funny.
[182:12.36]Critical, none.
[182:14.42]Tornado, play lumber.
[182:16.46]Where's, how do I, weapons.
[182:19.08]Eight.
[182:20.96]Okay.
[182:24.56]I want to do this right now.
[182:27.16]You just have to escape and there's a bunch of weapons everywhere.
[182:31.24]Unlimited time.
[182:31.84]Alright, let's do it.
[182:35.62]I need to see this, like right now.
[182:36.78]I don't even care.
[182:39.76]Cookie Monster in the cage?
[182:42.14]Alright, and we know we can do this.
[182:43.02]Let's make Cookie Monster real quick.
[182:48.62]This is gonna be the fastest you've ever seen somebody make a character, okay?
[182:51.54]Here we go, Cookie Monster.
[182:55.14]Speedrun.
[183:04.78]I'm just quiet, and we're going.
[183:07.02]Cookie Monster.
[183:29.52]Some of you are going to get this.
[183:30.88]And those of you that get it, be nice.
[183:32.62]I'm glad you got it.
[184:01.57]Come on.
[184:02.55]Speedrun.
[184:05.27]No, get that shit off your face.
[184:13.78]God damn it.
[184:15.34]Fuck.
[184:42.46]Shit!
[184:54.91]Get rid of this.
[184:55.39]Give me that one.
[184:57.13]Come on.
[184:57.31]I gotta go.
[184:59.17]There it is.
[185:11.11]Blue, okay.
[185:22.87]Okay, we need, like, just the eyes.
[185:24.83]There we are.
[185:29.07]That's not right.
[185:29.63]That's not right.
[185:30.14]Give me the other one.
[185:36.72]Cookie Monster doesn't have fucking hair.
[185:39.88]Come on, quick, quick.
[185:40.62]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[185:43.82]There it is.
[185:52.37]We're done?
[185:58.07]Uh... Uh, I'm going too fast.
[186:42.25]Let's go!
[186:57.71]What is it?
[186:58.35]Which one is it?
[187:10.38]No, it's okay baby.
[187:11.08]I think it's male too, right?
[187:11.70]Good.
[187:12.38]Is it like an eating cookies sound?
[187:43.40]It has to be like a... Shit.
[187:44.78]Go back.
[187:45.96]That's pretty good.
[187:49.08]That's pretty good like Cookie Monster making noise.
[187:53.62]Hold on.
[188:21.89]There it is.
[188:25.56]And the humming is how he would start a bit.
[188:35.06]That's him eating the cookies, ripping his head back and forth.
[188:38.20]Got it.
[188:40.40]We're done.
[188:53.72]Good.
[188:54.26]Return.
[188:55.74]Now let's throw these guys into a cage.
[188:57.24]Let's move.
[189:02.83]Well, this is going to be more annoying than the chewing gum.
[189:09.07]That was that cookie monster.
[189:17.24]It's like a Silent Hill boss.
[189:19.70]Alright, let's go.
[189:24.03]CP logic, that's fine.
[189:25.51]Save.
[189:27.01]New save.
[189:28.35]Here we are.
[189:29.17]Bingo.
[189:30.05]Cage deathmatch.
[189:34.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[189:35.36]I get it.
[189:35.86]I feel ya.
[189:41.74]Exhibition.
[189:43.10]Cage deathmatch.
[189:46.44]Let's go to the settings.
[189:47.48]Weapons 8.
[189:48.56]Matches 1 unlimited time.
[189:49.84]Escape the cage.
[189:52.59]CPU level.
[189:53.21]Let's make him like a little smarter.
[189:54.40]How about a six?
[189:56.84]I like that.
[189:57.78]No ropes.
[189:59.66]Fuck the ropes.
[190:00.26]Are you serious?
[190:04.64]And let's go ahead and put some people in.
[190:08.76]All the way down.
[190:13.22]Guy Fieri.
[190:18.18]I'm so mad that he's good.
[190:19.76]Donald Duck.
[190:22.63]Put crits on?
[190:23.41]I will.
[190:23.69]Let's put the Chewing Gum over here.
[190:27.53]This is a stacked team.
[190:28.43]We've got to put some better wrestlers on the other team.
[190:34.08]I don't need to be in this one.
[190:40.06]Put Shitty Wolverine over here.
[190:43.89]Put Cookie Monster over here.
[190:50.19]Cookie Monster.
[190:52.43]That's not even fucking close, man.
[190:56.53]I'll put him on, don't worry.
[190:59.98]We're going to put the Dan McCarthy over here.
[191:02.18]And we also need Seagull.
[191:10.32]No, no, no.
[191:10.82]Let's really just do a match with all chewing gum.
[191:13.67]You wouldn't have any idea what the fuck is going on.
[191:18.41]In fact, we're going to do that next.
[191:23.75]And the final entrant is... Who am I missing here?
[191:33.67]Who am I missing?
[191:34.73]Cookie Monster?
[191:35.31]Guy Fieri?
[191:41.75]Who am I missing?
[191:46.81]Me, Iron Giant, and Goombini.
[191:48.85]But we replaced one, right?
[191:53.20]Donald Duck is over there.
[191:55.69]But didn't we make the Cookie Monster?
[191:57.81]No.
[191:58.51]Do I have to be in it again?
[191:59.47]Gumbini's dead, so I have to be in it again.
[192:05.29]I'm like the shittiest character.
[192:08.98]I hope I die.
[192:10.54]Like, somebody please kill me.
[192:12.80]I hope this is where I die, like right now.
[192:16.19]Alright, let's do settings.
[192:18.13]Critical.
[192:19.89]I cannot turn crits on.
[192:22.07]Unfortunately.
[192:23.19]It is not allowed when you escape the cage.
[192:28.68]Alright, here we go.
[192:29.42]Please kill me.
[192:34.18]Cage match.
[192:34.76]Escape the cage.
[192:35.38]They're just fucking sledgehammers and chairs and shit.
[192:40.61]Is there a table?
[192:42.39]Unless it's boards of wood.
[192:49.14]Cookie Monster is clearly just a bear.
[192:50.98]No one's picked up a weapon yet.
[192:53.78]Now I want to turn the voices off.
[192:55.24]I don't want the voices on anymore.
[193:02.34]They're not even funny now.
[193:06.64]Somebody pick up a weapon!
[193:16.61]This is going to take forever.
[193:17.61]Somebody just has to climb out.
[193:22.88]Somebody will eventually just do it while the rest of the players are distracted.
[193:27.30]Oh, fuck.
[193:27.72]And there's a normal guy.
[193:28.98]There's a normal referee.
[193:33.31]What a disaster.
[193:37.83]Where's the anime referee?
[193:39.31]In the night off.
[193:44.45]I don't know why anyone's doing submissions.
[193:45.69]You can't pin.
[193:46.47]You can't submit.
[193:47.21]You have to escape the ring.
[193:50.49]The first one of these fucking idiots that realizes you can pick up one of the weapons on the ground.
[193:56.15]They are going to have a great time.
[194:00.45]Pick up a weapon.
[194:05.57]Pick up a chair.
[194:06.29]Pick up a bat.
[194:06.83]There's like fluorescent light bulbs.
[194:10.61]What are you doing?
[194:13.38]Somebody get to the top.
[194:14.22]I wasn't going to climb up all the way to the top and jump off.
[194:20.00]The invisible man can just sneak out.
[194:21.64]That's true.
[194:22.71]He has the advantage.
[194:26.83]I really am just shocked by the noise.
[194:29.99]I heard something.
[194:30.73]What was that?
[194:31.13]That was like a garbage can.
[194:32.07]The birds can just fly out.
[194:42.50]Somebody do something.
[194:43.50]Come on, pick up a fucking weapon.
[194:46.15]Make it interesting.
[194:46.97]Don't just say your respective voice line.
[194:52.40]The only one that's doing anything cool is the chewing gum.
[195:11.00]Oh, we got a weapon!
[195:13.24]No, that's a glove.
[195:14.94]That's one of the fucking invisible hands.
[195:17.68]I thought that was a weapon.
[195:18.98]I thought it was like a toaster oven.
[195:31.82]Ugh.
[195:32.04]Turn off DQ?
[195:32.82]Wait, do you... Would somebody be disqualified if they use a weapon?
[195:45.65]That's not true, is it?
[195:46.37]Are you serious?
[195:48.97]Oh, fucking hell.
[195:56.02]DQ count is off.
[195:57.30]There's no DQ.
[195:58.90]They're just stupid.
[196:03.76]Critical, none.
[196:05.20]Okay, let's make them smart.
[196:06.64]We're gonna give them 10 brainpower.
[196:08.42]10 brainpower.
[196:12.60]Escape.
[196:14.52]Let's go.
[196:15.00]Maybe if I have to make their brains higher.
[196:16.98]Ah, ah, ah, of course.
[196:22.95]Alright.
[196:23.25]Maybe they're smart enough to pick it up now.
[196:25.81]Speed up the time?
[196:26.77]Speed up?
[196:28.19]Not yet.
[196:31.10]Are they smart enough?
[196:31.66]They have 10 intelligence.
[196:33.24]Still not smart enough to pick up a weapon, though.
[196:46.82]You want me to turn the speed up too?
[196:48.02]Alright, we're gonna turn the speed up too.
[196:52.38]It's just a normal cage match, but a bunch of shit.
[196:57.13]We'll do like 200.
[196:58.47]Double the speed.
[197:02.85]This will land much quicker.
[197:06.04]Here we go.
[197:08.54]Go.
[197:16.01]It's worse.
[197:17.05]This is much worse.
[197:23.84]It really does just, it just speeds it up.
[197:25.62]It doesn't actually do anything else.
[197:31.58]If nobody attempts to climb out of the cage by eight minutes, we're gonna do speed 800.
[197:43.88]I'm sort of like a chimpanzee.
[197:49.57]Somebody fucking pick up a weapon.
[197:56.83]Nope.
[198:01.31]No one's doing anything.
[198:02.87]They're stuck in a never-ending loop.
[198:07.65]I'm about to do eight chewing gums at 800.
[198:16.61]Look, at some point the AI has to figure out that you have to leave to win.
[198:21.55]Regardless if they figure out you have to pick up weapons on the ground.
[198:25.91]Someone's gotta figure it out.
[198:31.36]Four bugs, eight seagulls.
[198:37.68]Nobody's a heel so they're not picking up weapons?
[198:41.66]Oh god dammit.
[198:42.42]Alright, let's make a couple of these guys heels.
[198:46.46]Alright, we're gonna make the gum a heal and we're gonna do eight gums at 800.
[198:57.69]Eight gums at 800 and all of them are heals.
[199:00.65]Eight different flavors of gum.
[199:04.71]Alright, edit wrestler.
[199:08.29]Local edit, load, where is he?
[199:10.63]Chew the gum.
[199:13.85]And make him a bad guy.
[199:19.53]How do we do that?
[199:21.01]Profiles?
[199:21.55]Skills?
[199:24.00]What the hell was it?
[199:25.08]Parameters?
[199:28.36]No.
[199:31.42]CPU logic.
[199:32.66]No.
[199:34.28]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[199:35.38]CPU logic.
[199:36.10]Weapons.
[199:36.44]I just saw weapons.
[199:41.44]Weapons.
[199:42.84]1%?
[199:42.96]Are you shitting me?
[199:53.97]100.
[199:54.65]100%.
[199:54.69]That was a 1% chance every time they walked over it.
[200:00.73]And that should... Save.
[200:03.45]Let's do new save.
[200:04.78]Heal.
[200:06.72]Alright.
[200:07.60]Was doing 8 gums.
[200:08.54]Who cares?
[200:10.80]Who cares?
[200:15.17]Should I do different?
[200:15.97]We're gonna have to do different colors of gum to make it make any sense.
[200:22.80]Yeah, so let's go to parents.
[200:24.58]Let's just make him like pinker.
[200:31.06]Oh, sorry.
[200:31.78]Let's go like this.
[200:34.03]This is like grape gum.
[200:40.83]Make a new save.
[200:41.81]We'll just select them all.
[200:42.81]Don't matter.
[200:47.77]Okay, let's do it again.
[200:51.19]This is just the new serpents.
[200:52.51]Yeah, I know.
[200:54.88]This one's like blueberry.
[200:55.82]This is like blue raspberry.
[200:57.02]This is fucking stupid.
[200:57.94]We're done after this.
[200:59.18]Blue raspberry and then green apple.
[201:00.48]And then there's gonna be like, who cares?
[201:06.70]In fact, I'm already done.
[201:07.48]This is the new serpents.
[201:11.14]We already did this.
[201:12.06]We did this.
[201:12.70]This is the serpent thing we did already.
[201:17.71]No, fucking, we're doing all, who cares, it's 800 speed, you're not even gonna be able to tell what the fuck is going on anyways.
[201:23.70]And the referee has to be gum too.
[201:32.34]This is an all gum affair here.
[201:38.57]Zebra stripe gum.
[201:48.59]No, I don't care.
[201:50.33]Fuck this.
[201:55.85]All I did is made that guy gain a bunch of weight.
[201:57.69]Alright, here we go.
[202:05.53]Exhibition cage deathmatch.
[202:12.61]It's just gonna be gum.
[202:17.22]Chewed gum.
[202:20.76]800 speed.
[202:21.12]Oh my god, this is fucking stupid.
[202:32.55]Somebody just gave $50, but hold on, hold on a second.
[202:40.61]It's just gonna be all... This is going to look like somebody just dumped paint down in like a desk.
[202:47.61]It's going to be like a desk painting section, like when you were fucking in the fourth grade.
[202:52.31]Alright.
[202:52.87]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[202:53.65]Hold on.
[202:54.81]Get this.
[202:55.11]Let's... Topec.
[202:57.95]Thank you, Topec, for the 50 bucks.
[203:02.37]Okay, baby.
[203:03.55]Jermajoop2, cheer 5000.
[203:05.21]Thank you so much for the $50.
[203:08.29]There was a lot of money tonight, and I promise I will get to it.
[203:12.57]Probably not going to stream for that much longer.
[203:14.13]We'll do like this.
[203:14.91]We'll do one more thing.
[203:16.99]And we'll go from there.
[203:18.41]The Cookie Monster pretty much is gum.
[203:21.48]But thank you, Topek, again, so much for $50,000.
[203:25.92]It's very generous of you.
[203:35.83]Those of you that think this is going to be funny, you may as well just close your eyes.
[203:43.68]Cause it ain't gonna be, it's not gonna be that funny.
[203:49.65]This is gonna be, this is gonna be annoying.
[203:55.41]They're all gonna be humming.
[203:56.35]Alright, here we go.
[203:59.57]Escape, 8, CPU level 10, speed 800.
[204:06.62]Rope off, tornado on, DQ con off.
[204:09.48]Critical, I can't change it.
[204:10.68]Okay.
[204:12.36]Okay.
[204:14.21]Okay, you can open your eyes.
[204:15.03]Here comes the gum battle.
[204:27.40]It just looks- Oh, wait, wait!
[204:28.92]Ooh, somebody won!
[204:30.22]What?!
[204:31.62]What is going on?
[204:32.18]Why are they waiting?
[204:36.50]It's like a pack of fucking wild hyenas.
[204:40.38]Coyotes.
[204:44.91]Do they still fight?
[204:46.41]I'm sorry, he used a weapon.
[204:59.40]It does sound like a Zumbini fight.
[205:02.25]Wait, one got out.
[205:03.29]No one got out.
[205:03.99]Nope.
[205:14.57]Who won?
[205:15.53]Who won?
[205:16.09]Nobody won.
[205:16.65]I don't understand.
[205:33.04]I want to be able to follow that a little more.
[205:35.26]Alright, let's do 300.
[205:35.82]Try it again.
[205:36.24]Go.
[205:48.32]This is vector man.
[205:54.77]I'm sorry guys.
[205:58.71]I thought it was going to happen.
[206:03.43]I'm just screaming tonight.
[206:27.30]This is actually un-fucking-bearable.
[206:46.78]There's one blue guy.
[206:48.06]I'm rooting for the blue guy.
[206:51.55]I keep opening up this window and I regret it every time.
[206:56.13]You're just tapping in and like immediately like get the fuck out of here.
[207:13.37]Why'd it take him so long to get out now?
[207:18.41]Alright, here comes the first one.
[207:21.59]Nope.
[207:22.75]Almost.
[207:27.72]Ten minutes have elapsed.
[207:35.22]They're just going backwards onto each other and shit.
[207:39.08]Alright, escape!
[207:40.36]Escape!
[207:41.60]Get out, come on!
[207:42.76]Get out from under the desk!
[207:46.42]Right underneath the fucking fourth-grader's desk!
[207:50.21]Oh, that was bad.
[208:09.38]That was the worst voice crack I think I've ever had in my life, and I'm 32.
[208:14.02]Wait, they're leaving, they're escaping, they're escaping!
[208:17.38]One of them has a face.
[208:23.32]Come on, go, go, go!
[208:26.77]That was a double splash.
[208:29.25]Get him, get him, get him!
[208:32.73]I guess he's letting them get away.
[208:48.42]The poor blue guy the poor blue guy didn't make it out I love it.
[208:57.37]Okay.
[208:57.73]How are we gonna how are we gonna end this?
[209:01.31]What have we not done in this fucking game?
[209:05.93]Barb wire deathmatch SW a rules.
[209:08.95]What does it mean?
[209:13.89]It's three rounds now, that's gonna take forever I
[209:19.87]You were rooting for the blue guys, the only one that lost.
[209:21.91]Alright, gruesome fight.
[209:25.19]All seagulls.
[209:27.71]We got eight seagulls.
[209:33.24]Now we'll do a seagull fight to end it.
[209:36.64]Like an absolute just deathmatch.
[209:38.70]I thought that just said dogecoin.
[209:40.10]I was like, what the fuck does that mean?
[209:41.62]Alright.
[209:43.42]Give up only.
[209:46.64]There are no weapons here though, unfortunately.
[209:51.93]We just need like a barbed wire deathmatch.
[209:53.93]I think that's the only way it'll work.
[209:59.23]Barb, we haven't done this yet, so let's try it.
[210:01.23]Okay.
[210:05.76]That's fine.
[210:07.72]Wait, which one's the fat Mr. Judgment?
[210:09.24]No, we gotta keep the anime.
[210:10.12]Judge, come on.
[210:12.12]Explosion countdown.
[210:17.63]What does that mean?
[210:21.45]The ring explodes.
[210:24.22]Okay.
[210:25.34]Let's watch this on normal speed, because I feel like... I feel like this is gonna... It's gonna get a little out of hand.
[210:34.66]Time unlimited.
[210:35.48]Explosion countdown.
[210:36.99]What?
[210:37.23]Five minutes?
[210:38.03]Ten minutes?
[210:40.13]One minute?
[210:42.97]You motherfuckers have one minute to win.
[210:44.85]Alright, let's go.
[210:47.99]One minute.
[210:56.54]One minute at 300 speed.
[210:59.92]One minute at 800 speed.
[211:01.06]Oh, we got Seagull.
[211:06.44]There he is.
[211:10.80]Yeah, crits are going on.
[211:11.70]Don't worry.
[211:13.00]I'll get those locked in.
[211:14.15]Don't you worry.
[211:21.11]Yep, I gotta go into the weapon.
[211:22.97]It's alright.
[211:24.86]Look, don't even worry about it.
[211:27.65]This is gonna be over in ten seconds.
[211:30.45]No, I'm not doing eight Guy Fieri's.
[211:32.21]We're not doing eight of each.
[211:35.47]The ring is gonna explode, guys.
[211:36.63]They're not even gonna get a chance to pick a weapon up.
[211:38.11]It's gonna be insane.
[211:44.51]Seagulls versus Donald Ducks?
[211:46.49]We gotta do all seagulls first.
[211:49.11]That's really important.
[211:53.43]This is a callback.
[211:58.44]Let's call back to the last stream we did.
[212:03.60]Sometimes we do those.
[212:08.53]I need to put a puffin in there.
[212:09.83]Oh god.
[212:11.93]No.
[212:14.53]All hands?
[212:17.22]I have an idea.
[212:18.08]That's really stupid, but what if I just make the invisible man actually invisible?
[212:23.44]And put eight people in there.
[212:24.80]What happens?
[212:25.26]Is it going to be blood and shit?
[212:26.52]I want to do that too.
[212:28.52]Alright, here we go.
[212:30.49]Let's check the settings.
[212:32.95]Explosion countdown 1.
[212:34.15]800 speed.
[212:35.55]Here we go.
[212:41.45]Buckle your seatbelts.
[212:42.19]This is going to be out of hand.
[212:43.81]Let's see what happens.
[213:08.92]They all get up, apparently.
[213:16.53]Somebody died.
[213:17.25]Well, that was... That was a thing.
[213:28.83]Now we got... We gotta do... I'm gonna do all invisible people.
[213:38.06]I want to do all invisible people and me in the ring.
[213:45.06]Crits?
[213:45.44]What do you mean crits?
[213:46.46]They all died in eight seconds.
[213:51.08]Let me go back.
[213:51.92]I want to do this.
[213:52.64]It's going to be seven invisible people and me.
[213:55.78]We'll see what happens.
[213:59.17]Inside a fucking explosion match.
[214:04.73]We really are going to make a real invisible man.
[214:12.11]There he is, Dan McCarthy.
[214:15.82]And wrestler appearance.
[214:20.65]If this actually works, this game is worth buying.
[214:24.03]If I can actually do this.
[214:34.34]Okay.
[214:35.40]So, you have seen in the stream so far, this game is worth buying just to dick around with your friends.
[214:41.95]For sure.
[214:44.37]This is absolutely worth it.
[214:46.47]It's approved.
[214:52.07]So, we're going to do seven Dan McCarthy's.
[214:55.31]Wait, I've got to make sure it's the right one.
[214:57.95]I get it.
[214:58.33]I don't know which one it is.
[215:00.15]Versus me.
[215:05.65]Offline play, exhibition, barbed wire deathmatch.
[215:12.67]And here we go.
[215:20.39]Let's put me in there.
[215:21.23]There I am.
[215:30.90]This is not even... This is going to be so dumb.
[215:40.29]Should Dan McCarthy even have sound effects?
[215:43.49]Part of me says no.
[215:50.22]But we're going to just do it anyways.
[215:59.60]Yeah, it's me just fighting my inner demons.
[216:01.86]That's all this is going to be.
[216:06.11]Okay.
[216:07.53]Here we go.
[216:10.34]It's been real.
[216:11.46]Let's just make sure all the settings are correct.
[216:13.52]Not at 800.
[216:13.92]I was going to do it normally.
[216:16.98]We'll do 5 minutes before the... No.
[216:19.34]We'll do just 10 minutes before it explodes.
[216:22.14]5 minutes?
[216:22.41]No.
[216:22.81]5 minutes.
[216:23.05]5 minutes before it explodes.
[216:25.57]Or 10 minutes before it explodes.
[216:32.19]Criticals high.
[216:38.33]I'll do 10.
[216:40.26]Weapons.
[216:40.90]Level 10.
[216:41.66]Speed 100.
[216:42.00]That's fine.
[216:43.08]DQ off.
[216:43.74]Critical high.
[216:45.62]Let's give it a go.
[216:48.10]Wind condition.
[216:52.19]Pinfall only.
[216:55.21]Three count.
[216:56.95]No, we're going to keep three count.
[216:58.99]That means you're on the ground for three seconds.
[217:01.85]Alright, who even gives a shit?
[217:02.85]Here we go.
[217:04.12]It begins.
[217:07.14]I should control myself.
[217:08.46]Yes, that's a good idea.
[217:11.76]I'm gonna control myself here.
[217:14.60]I'll pick up the fucking weapons.
[217:15.74]Fuck these idiots.
[217:17.14]Me versus all my fucking inner demons.
[217:19.82]Let's go.
[217:25.48]I can see their shadows.
[217:27.75]How do you pick up weapons?
[217:32.09]Once I figure that out, it's game over.
[217:37.83]How do you pick up a weapon?
[217:41.60]Pick up weapon.
[217:42.56]Pick it up.
[217:45.74]Got it.
[217:46.38]Okay.
[217:47.50]Oh, no, I don't got it.
[217:48.34]There it is.
[217:49.54]Shit.
[217:52.50]Give me the baseball bat, please.
[218:02.05]No, God.
[218:03.61]What if somebody exploded over there?
[218:05.03]What in this blood over here?
[218:07.43]Why is there blood?
[218:12.25]Hit somebody.
[218:14.45]Nope.
[218:14.87]Reverse explosion.
[218:19.03]Give me the bat.
[218:22.27]I don't even have an opportunity to do anything.
[218:25.53]There's too many people.
[218:31.94]No.
[218:32.36]Nope.
[218:35.30]Alright, that's how you do an overhead swing.
[218:37.42]I got it.
[218:42.91]Overheads to- I would- Oh, god damn it!
[218:45.71]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[218:51.30]Come on!
[218:52.84]Could I honestly not hit somebody?
[219:02.36]I'm the only person picking up the weapons.
[219:08.45]Why does the overheads- I'm going up the top rope.
[219:12.09]No, I can't.
[219:14.09]Great.
[219:17.23]Somebody... Somebody picked up a weapon.
[219:20.95]I gotta get away from the shadow.
[219:24.13]How did I... Wait.
[219:28.69]No, I just figured something out, guys.
[219:29.73]They don't have any hitboxes.
[219:32.21]That's what's going on.
[219:35.85]They don't have hitboxes.
[219:37.71]There's no person here.
[219:38.47]Why would I think I could hit the invisible man?
[219:40.15]They're actually not here.
[219:44.98]I can't even attack someone.
[219:46.70]You understand that?
[219:48.42]All I can do is get hit.
[219:49.96]I can just lose.
[219:50.70]That's it.
[219:56.17]I can try to reverse their move.
[220:00.35]Yep.
[220:01.57]All I can do is get hit and I can reverse their move.
[220:13.08]There are two people right here.
[220:16.59]What?
[220:20.41]It's like three minutes.
[220:21.41]Can I just hit the fucking ref?
[220:23.99]The ref is real.
[220:24.73]Let's test our theory here.
[220:31.01]No!
[220:31.63]No!
[220:35.33]Just keep breaking it up.
[220:36.52]The rings are gonna explode anyway, so who cares?
[220:45.76]Get up!
[220:46.68]Don't do it!
[220:48.24]The ring has to explode.
[220:52.29]I can't just knock out the ref.
[220:59.77]I can't seriously just knock him out.
[221:07.37]Only three more minutes and we can end this misery.
[221:15.59]There's nobody to hit.
[221:17.19]It don't matter.
[221:17.93]I'll just walk around like a dickhead for another two minutes.
[221:22.96]I'll be pushed around.
[221:24.08]Might as well just fucking run into the walls again.
[221:32.10]How can you determine there's a pin?
[221:36.21]If I get hit with that, I swear to god.
[221:39.01]I was gonna say, just hit the right in front of the pin.
[221:42.53]Am I being pinned?
[221:43.65]No.
[221:48.56]I reversed it.
[221:51.16]I guess I'm reversing this.
[221:53.70]Who am I in a fight with?
[222:01.09]No!
[222:01.55]Don't pin!
[222:02.29]Come on.
[222:02.93]Oh, here comes the explosion.
[222:07.11]We're all over here.
[222:08.05]It's just a bunch of people over here.
[222:14.13]One minute, here it comes.
[222:15.33]20 seconds.
[222:15.85]What happened?
[222:20.21]Am I dead?
[222:22.27]Oh no, that's when the ring explodes.
[222:24.39]No, I don't give up.
[222:25.41]That's it.
[222:41.10]Oh, did somebody pin me?
[222:44.16]I've had enough.
[222:49.44]Bloody face.
[222:50.78]That's it.
[222:51.22]We lose.
[222:51.62]Game over.
[222:52.54]Finally.
[222:53.38]The nightmare can end.
[222:58.29]The crowd is loving this.
[223:07.05]Which invisible man won?
[223:08.17]I don't know.
[223:09.63]That one.
[223:13.14]By the way, guys, he did it with a super kick.
[223:15.40]Nice.
[223:18.89]Alright.
[223:19.31]That's gonna be it.
[223:24.23]That's gonna be the end of the stream tonight.
[223:27.73]Wait, I won?
[223:32.21]Oh, my team won.
[223:33.31]Okay.
[223:35.52]Ugh.
[223:38.50]Let me just use the bathroom real quick.
[223:39.80]I'll come back and we'll assess the situation.
[223:42.28]I'll be right back.
[223:43.28]I'm gonna pee.
[223:53.27]Wait, what?
[225:53.55]Alright.
[225:55.45]So, yeah, that's going to wrap it up.
[225:56.21]I'm going to go rest my head.
[225:58.67]I didn't think I was going to be laughing that much this stream.
[226:03.55]That is going to be the end tonight.
[226:05.74]So, again, thank you for watching, everybody.
[226:09.46]Much love.
[226:10.70]Thanks for sticking around.
[226:11.48]I'm going to read the bits that came out today over the last few hours here.
[226:19.68]Thank you for sticking around.
[226:21.23]See you on Thursday.
[226:21.81]Bye.
[226:24.09]Remember the Great Seagull War?
[226:26.41]I do.
[226:28.27]But, before you leave, if you're curious, Friday is the planned Christmas decoration stream.
[226:37.65]So, Friday is where that's probably going to happen.
[226:40.11]I don't think it's going to happen on Thursday.
[226:42.73]It might happen on Thursday.
[226:43.97]It depends on if I get one very specific item.
[226:46.32]There's one specific thing that has to happen.
[226:49.32]If it's not Thursday, it'll be Friday.
[226:52.72]So,
[226:54.30]With that being said, let's read some bits.
[226:56.68]I'm going to start up, which, well, four hours ago here.
[227:01.85]It was... Let's move it over here.
[227:05.27]Why not?
[227:06.77]Turn this down just so you can hear me.
[227:09.20]And there's no distractions.
[227:13.09]Thank you to Alessa Genova for the $5.
[227:14.63]Hi, Jerma.
[227:16.36]I just want to say that yesterday my dog has been put to sleep.
[227:19.42]She was 17 years old and she was with us her whole life and most of mine.
[227:23.76]However, your streams always make me feel better and I know today won't be the exception.
[227:27.94]You're very important for your viewers and that's a thing a few streamers can say.
[227:30.84]Thank you.
[227:33.32]Very sorry to hear about your dog.
[227:36.81]I've gone through that a couple of times now.
[227:39.37]And actually, the last one was just about 17 years old.
[227:44.41]So I know what that's like.
[227:49.21]I wish you the best, obviously.
[227:50.46]And hopefully you can grow and kind of move on.
[227:58.28]When you have a dog or a cat or whatever, especially a dog for that long,
[228:02.42]That becomes somebody that's part of the family.
[228:04.18]That's a family member.
[228:06.12]That's not just a dog anymore, you know?
[228:08.00]I have a dog.

[229:41.94]Going to have an interview tomorrow.
[229:43.31]Really nervous.
[229:43.89]Got any suggestions for not bombing an interview?
[229:48.51]Tell the truth.
[229:50.73]A lot of times people when they go to interviews, they want to sort of pretend like they're doing more or pretend like they talk themselves up more than they can.
[230:00.00]And if you start like bullshitting in an interview, you might get a little nervous.
[230:05.20]So just tell the truth.
[230:06.84]Be as honest as you can.
[230:09.30]You don't want somebody to think you're like making shit up because I've like done that before.
[230:15.61]I interviewed it like, do not be completely honest.
[230:20.15]What are you talking about, do not be completely honest?
[230:26.58]You gotta be honest.
[230:29.36]They're gonna find out in a fucking week if what you're saying is true.
[230:33.56]Lying?
[230:34.58]You're gonna lie to your fucking workplace?
[230:36.61]Oh yeah, you know, I had a fucking 4.0 GPA, and by the way, I also know how to juggle.
[230:43.31]Why don't you juggle right now?
[230:45.54]Oh, shit.
[230:47.52]Don't tell a interviewer that you know how to juggle.
[230:51.88]Don't do that, because they're going to fucking make you do it on the spot.
[230:53.94]It's going to be a funny little party trick, and you're going to mess it up, and they're going to make you leave.
[231:02.03]I've had plenty of fucking jobs over my life, guys.
[231:04.53]You understand?
[231:06.41]I interviewed at fucking Staples, okay?
[231:07.91]I interviewed at Staples.
[231:13.80]And I didn't get the job.
[231:15.24]You know why?
[231:15.90]Because I fucking, I was like, let me tell you all these fucking wonderful things that I know how to do.
[231:23.67]And the lady just was staring at me the whole time.
[231:26.49]She was literally staring right through me while I like talked up my fucking life.
[231:30.49]Well, you know, I'm currently in film school.
[231:33.65]Okay, I don't care.
[231:36.07]And my resume, I have a good resume too.
[231:39.85]My resume was fucking awful.
[231:45.14]Usually you learn that you have to lie.
[231:49.07]No, you don't have to lie.
[231:50.15]Just like be honest about like, you know, just say you want to go for management.
[231:58.32]you know be like hey I really think this job is an interesting job but I want management that's my goal and I'm ready to take it and like just hold your hands down and fists and like make your face fucking purple and then they'll the guy will just be like okay absolutely you got it sir but in all in all actuality um
[232:23.11]uh you want to make yourself sound desirable you want to make yourself sound more desirable than the other potential 10 20 30 40 people maybe even like dozens of or hundreds of people that are applying for the same job
[232:36.18]Make yourself desirable, but don't overdo it.
[232:38.22]Don't make it sound like you're some fucking superhero.
[232:40.54]Because a lot of people do that.
[232:42.30]And then they get the job.
[232:43.96]And then they get fired because they're not a superhero.
[232:46.12]And the guy, like, thought you were a superhero.
[232:48.41]That's like going into fucking... That's like going into Staples, right?
[232:51.89]As Clark Kent.
[232:54.59]And... You tell the person, oh, I just wanted to let you know.
[232:58.90]Uh... I'm Superman.
[233:02.36]And they're gonna be like, really?
[233:03.24]Yeah.
[233:03.70]Yeah.
[233:05.08]Okay, Clark Kent, you're Superman.
[233:06.44]Yes, I am.
[233:08.16]But then you never take off the glasses at work.
[233:10.15]You get the job and you're just sitting and everyone always asks you to be Superman.
[233:12.91]You don't ever do it.
[233:14.55]You don't ever take off your glasses.
[233:15.69]They're going to want to see it.
[233:18.49]They're going to want to see you juggle.
[233:20.91]That doesn't make any sense because Superman is Superman.
[233:24.19]That's like going into a job and if you're dressed as Clark Kent.
[233:27.53]So you're dressed as Clark Kent and you say to the person that you're Superman and they think that you are Clark Kent so they're like, okay.
[233:34.29]Let's see the fucking radar eyes.
[233:39.99]Anyways, good luck on your interview.
[233:46.64]Can Superman juggle?
[233:48.26]Excuse me.
[233:50.78]Good luck on your interview, Penn.
[233:53.90]All this advice I've given you has been pretty bad, but just be yourself and make yourself seem more desirable.
[233:59.96]You got it.
[234:00.28]You're going to fucking nail it.
[234:01.10]Don't worry.

[235:29.46]Hey, Jerma, I just finished up a year of training for the Navy and about to go out on a submarine.
[235:35.80]Damn.
[235:37.46]That sounds pretty fucking cool.
[235:41.99]Is a submarine... Alright, so when you go up in the air in an airplane, there's air pressure and the cabin is pressurized.
[235:50.14]Is a submarine pressurized?
[235:51.82]How far does a submarine go down?
[235:55.40]Is inside of this a cabin of a submarine, a pressurized cabin?
[235:58.32]How does that work?
[235:59.86]Because I know that you get like the reverse pressure when you go down.
[236:03.30]Right?
[236:06.66]So an airplane and a submarine are the same thing.
[236:09.50]Just one goes up and one goes down.
[236:12.36]Alright, cool.
[236:13.86]Cool.
[236:14.02]Alright.
[236:14.51]I was curious.
[236:14.89]I didn't know.
[236:15.97]But I wanted to say thanks for all the laughs and for being one of the few things in my life that hasn't changed over the past year.
[236:23.85]Well, first of all, underappreciated.

[236:47.16]If you are, then I'm sorry to hear about that.
[236:51.18]But take care.
[236:53.80]Jerma never changes.
[236:57.49]What am I going to do?
[237:00.25]How am I going to change?

[238:46.70]They were so happy when I went to go take a shit because they knew I was going to go read.

[239:14.63]They're not called seagulls.
[239:15.93]Just call them gulls.
[239:17.67]Some gulls never go near the sea.
[239:21.33]That's actually a pretty interesting fact.
[239:22.61]I did not know that.
[239:24.35]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $5.
[239:27.53]Well, with a beak like that, I guess you could say this bird is quite a pecker.

[239:35.50]Thank you, MooMeansMoo.
[239:38.32]RottingMemes, thanks for the $1.
[239:40.22]Is it possible to make a wrestler's body part so small that he's invisible?
[239:44.52]You showed up just in the nick of time.
[239:46.00]That's when we made the invisible guy.
[239:48.24]Actually, we made him a long time before that, I think.
[239:51.43]I think we were still making characters before you got to see them.
[239:53.91]But thank you for the $1 rotting memes.
[239:57.61]Robert Fruit.
[239:58.83]Thanks for the $1.
[240:00.57]I was trying to convince my friend to watch your stream.
[240:02.58]And when I told him he was the crazy streamer who beat Dark Souls 3 on stream, he looked unimpressed.
[240:08.74]He then asked me, did he finish Bloodborne on stream?
[240:12.17]I'll tell you that shut me up real quick as I was scrambling to try and say something, tears started streaming down my face.
[240:19.37]Will you ever play through Bloodborne on stream so I can't stop being bullied at school for watching someone who didn't finish Bloodborne?
[240:29.21]Well, that's not even true because I've finished Bloodborne like four or five times, just not on stream.
[240:38.04]Hey, look, might not even have to do Bloodborne.
[240:40.89]Or maybe I will.
[240:41.65]Maybe I'll do Bloodborne when they announce Bloodborne 2.
[240:45.33]Who knows what the new FromSoftware game is.
[240:49.53]Could be Bloodborne 2.
[240:50.71]It's going to be some other random weird game.
[240:52.72]We're going to be playing it for sure, whatever it is.
[240:55.78]Just hope it's not Armored Core.
[240:58.22]Because I don't know why people like those games.
[241:04.06]That was mean.
[241:05.26]I'm just kidding.
[241:06.40]I'm kidding.
[241:06.78]90% of the things I say aren't real.
[241:09.54]Chuck Eton, thanks for the $1.
[241:10.86]Shoutouts to the Zorgroff.
[241:18.21]The pensive destroyer getting his full 99s tonight.
[241:22.83]What?
[241:25.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[241:27.93]Anyways, thank you Lenzy6 for the $2.
[241:30.80]Hey, Jerma, what's your thoughts on Coinbase now accepting Bitcoin cash?
[241:34.42]People rushing to sell other cryptos caused their value to drop so much.
[241:37.96]A friend of mine lost about a year's salary from his portfolio in a few minutes.
[241:42.22]Would you like to know what the emergency was that Etalyx was calling me for?
[241:46.11]It was that.
[241:47.97]It was that.
[241:48.57]That was exactly what the emergency situation was.
[241:53.35]But if I look at Coinbase right now, it seems like things have started to settle down.
[242:01.58]It started to settle down here.
[242:05.16]There was a huge dump, but it looks like it's evening out a little.
[242:12.65]It was a perfect time to buy BTC.
[242:14.51]I'm going to dump down to fucking like 14, 15,000.
[242:17.07]That's why he was calling me.
[242:19.55]He's like, dude, they just put BCH on the, what are you going to do?
[242:22.31]And I'm like, I'm fucking streaming right now, man.
[242:25.39]Like, what am I, what do you mean?
[242:26.15]What am I going to turn the stream off and go open up and fucking dump Bitcoin cash?
[242:30.46]What do you want me to do?
[242:34.63]Huge dump.
[242:35.57]Come on, in quotes.
[242:36.83]What are you talking about huge dump in quotes?
[242:39.96]BTC was like fucking $19,000 two days ago.
[242:42.96]It went down to $15,000 today.
[242:45.06]That's a $4,000 drop.
[242:48.55]And that's a little bit of a boink, if you ask me.
[242:54.21]But whatever, who cares?
[242:55.51]Fucking crypto.
[242:56.15]I'm not going to talk about it on stream.
[242:57.63]I've already have said my piece about crypto.
[242:59.39]You know that I like crypto.
[243:00.61]I'm like a fucking crypto.
[243:01.50]I'm like, fuck, I'm the fucking crypt keeper up in here.
[243:03.18]You guys already know that.
[243:05.08]Fucking tales from the goddamn cryptocurrency is pretty much the name of the stream.
[243:10.34]But thank you, though.
[243:12.60]Thank you for telling me.
[243:14.46]Yerg, thanks for the bits.
[243:15.36]Haha, I can talk.
[243:16.36]Yes, you can.
[243:17.96]Bathtub Kid, thank you for the $5.00.
[243:21.84]Jerma, are you and Star still friends?
[243:24.36]I hope the question isn't personal.
[243:26.26]I really love your streams.
[243:27.18]Thanks for always making me laugh and smile and cheering up my day and again and again and again.
[243:32.16]Well, that question, that is a question and an answer that I'm going to give you.
[243:41.19]Star and I just kind of don't talk.
[243:45.45]We don't hate each other or anything.
[243:47.19]We just kind of don't really do anything anymore.
[243:52.09]That's pretty much it.
[243:53.33]It's not like... There's no like... Oh, fuck that guy!
[243:58.12]No, it's just we just kind of don't really do anything anymore.
[244:02.42]We've gone like kind of separate ways.
[244:04.74]And yes, there were some things that, you know, happened over the last year.
[244:09.33]But it was kind of just, you know, whatever.
[244:17.57]We talked, like...
[244:19.66]Not that long ago.
[244:20.50]Maybe like a few months ago, maybe?
[244:22.66]I forget what it was.
[244:25.12]But it's all good.
[244:25.94]Whatever.
[244:26.22]There's no reason... It's like there's no... I'm not going to... What do you want me to say?
[244:32.39]There's nothing... There's nothing there, so... Don't worry.
[244:38.93]Anyways.
[244:40.81]Ludus.
[244:41.21]Thank you, Ludus.
[244:46.73]For the $5...

[244:52.79]Yes.
[244:53.91]It goes like this.
[244:55.07]There ain't no fucking story.
[244:59.58]Not that long ago.
[245:00.62]But it is what it is, you know?
[245:05.60]It's not like a big deal.
[245:06.64]You don't have to make it like a big deal or anything.
[245:16.00]Ruined Christmas.
[245:22.28]Christmas is ruined.
[245:25.39]You know, I just wouldn't stop talking about cryptocurrency and everybody fucking loses their mind.
[245:34.55]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[245:37.11]First you BM'd Armored Core.
[245:43.77]No.
[245:44.82]Anyways.

[246:04.48]Christmas rumble is going to happen after New Year's, so it's going to be the Christmas after New Year's rumble.
[246:10.64]Anyways, thank you, Pin, for the $1.00.
[246:12.77]And they say, okay, baby, which was a very, very good quote from the stream.
[246:20.26]The meme rumble is going to kill the meme stream.
[246:22.25]That's going to be the title.
[246:24.43]You'll see it.
[246:24.85]When you see the title, it's kill the meme stream.
[246:26.81]That's the one.

[246:50.18]Uh, thank you TechnoToast for the $1.50.
[246:52.30]Holy shit, Jerma, this stream is the greatest stream.
[246:54.83]Makes me laugh just as hard as the canon Jerma rumbles.
[246:58.01]And thank you for bringing this joy into my life.
[246:59.89]The chewing gum absolutely destroyed me as soon as you started screaming in the ring.
[247:03.01]Hashtag charity.
[247:04.81]Thank you, TechnoToast.
[247:07.51]Glad you can enjoy it.
[247:09.43]It was a lot of fun.
[247:11.55]Before we go any further, let's just say that game is pretty much a recommend.
[247:19.36]Like I recommend... I recommend... I was going to say I recommend the stream.
[247:23.06]Okay?
[247:24.38]Sure you do.
[247:24.92]It's your stream.
[247:25.54]Why wouldn't you recommend it?
[247:28.01]But I recommend that game if you want to just stick around and have some fun.
[247:31.25]I think it has Steam Workshop integration too.
[247:33.01]You can find some really weird shit probably.

[247:59.18]Much love to you.
[248:00.00]It's a lot of money.
[248:01.81]Techno Toast again.
[248:02.57]Thanks for the bits.
[248:03.27]The fucking Royal Grumble.
[248:04.95]The Royal Gumble is making me laugh so hard I cry.
[248:08.21]Royal Gumble.
[248:11.89]Lenzy, thanks for the $1.
[248:12.93]They say he, which is the scream.
[248:16.49]Thank you so much, Lenzy.
[248:19.61]Also, thank you to Night Team 14 for the 15 bucks.
[248:24.91]I think you might have broke me this stream.

[248:52.14]Boots like shadows, our shadows quick.
[248:56.72]Thank you.
[248:58.86]Hard earned, what do you mean hard?
[249:00.68]$15 is a lot of money.
[249:04.00]That $15 is like a lunch with a drink.
[249:08.44]And that's like, that's a lot of fucking money.
[249:10.58]$15 is lunch, a large soda, and like a little bit of gas, you know what I mean?
[249:18.68]Fifteen bucks is a fucking lot of money, guys.
[249:20.04]What are you talking about?
[249:24.49]Oh, that was a... I get it.
[249:26.05]That was from the Mordor stream.
[249:28.57]Boots like land.
[249:32.80]Ay-yi-yi.
[249:33.86]Thank you, Toby Muerto, for the 250 seagull for the next live rumble.

[249:43.10]Thank you, Lenzy, again, for the $1.39.
[249:44.32]That's what they say.
[249:46.67]Grump Klump.
[249:47.29]Hey, Grump Klump.
[249:48.99]How you doing, Grump?
[249:50.93]$1, hashtag charity.
[249:53.73]Heckin' charity, my boy.
[249:56.57]Thank you, Grump.
[249:57.87]Thank you for the hashtag charity as well.
[249:59.95]Topac, thanks for the $3.
[250:01.01]And they say hashtag charity.
[250:05.44]Topac adding on to his $50.
[250:07.66]Thank you so much, dude.
[250:09.60]E-Cookie, thanks for the $0.35.
[250:11.84]Oh, Daddy Jerma, you are, I'm just going to say hashtag charity.
[250:14.97]Thanks a lot for the $0.35.
[250:15.73]Thanks.
[250:17.54]Skell, thanks for the five bucks.
[250:19.50]Holiday cheer, holiday cheer.
[250:20.65]Jerma never changes.
[250:25.61]I don't have the brain capacity to pretend to be somebody else every day.
[250:29.78]I really don't.
[250:32.38]I would get so... You know how exhausting that would be to pretend to be somebody?
[250:38.93]It'd be fucking tiring.
[250:41.21]But thank you, Skill.
[250:43.45]Uh, Vam Evan.
[250:44.65]Thank you, Vam Evan, for the 75 cents.
[250:46.92]What the hell, Jeremy?
[250:48.68]I don't know.
[250:50.24]What the hell?
[250:52.40]The roly-poly thanks for the $5 local chewing gum wrestling match explodes while going fast.
[250:56.76]Hashtag charity.
[250:59.17]Thank you.
[251:00.49]That's what acting is.
[251:02.47]Yeah, but acting, you take a break.
[251:05.17]If you're an actor, you get on camera, you pretend to be some guy, whether it's, today I'm going to be Winston Churchill.
[251:14.66]Where's my golden globe?
[251:16.44]And then you get away from the camera, you take off the fucking mask, and you go back to your regular life, and you can live your regular life.
[251:24.22]When you try to pretend that your regular life is Winston Churchill, that's where there's a problem.
[251:35.21]Right?
[251:36.37]Come on.
[251:39.21]Anyways, we only have a few more left.
[251:40.67]Thank you everybody for sticking around.
[251:43.54]I think we found a nerve.
[251:46.70]No.
[251:48.10]I actually can't wait to see that movie.
[251:50.18]That movie looks like it's going to be pretty awesome.
[251:53.24]It's just Winston Churchill pretending to be Gary Oldman for fucking two hours.
[251:58.33]It's just Gary Oldman doing like a fat guy for two and a half hours.
[252:01.71]I can't wait to see it.
[252:06.78]Thank you to... Let's see, let's see, let's see.
[252:12.65]Frosty Wolverine, thanks for the two bucks.
[252:14.63]Hey, Jerma, I just had a colonoscopy today and it turns out I have Crohn's.
[252:18.47]I saw your stream where you talk about living with IBS and it took some of the edge off.
[252:21.95]You're my favorite streamer.
[252:22.77]Keep it up.
[252:24.91]Yes, I do.
[252:25.47]I have IBD is what I have.
[252:29.45]IBD.
[252:32.20]That is... I'm so terrible.
[252:34.62]I feel terrible that you got that diagnosis.
[252:38.26]But just know that eventually... I said this last time we talked about it.
[252:45.65]I lived through fucking hell when I was getting diagnosed with colitis, Crohn's, whatever, IBD.
[252:51.03]It's fucking all over the place.
[252:53.21]But when I got initially diagnosed with colitis, it was just a fucking living goddamn hell.
[253:00.18]Every day.
[253:02.37]and but now I am fine now when it comes to that I'm on a new I was on a I put on a new medication like a year or two ago I'm trying to think if that's like the correct time frame it probably is and I feel fine like it's it's in total remission at this point sometimes it it does like flare up sometimes and it can be like a real pain in the ass like obviously literally and figuratively like yeah my ass um
[253:29.62]It's very, very treatable at this point.
[253:31.34]There's a lot of different medicines.
[253:33.26]And I'm sure you're already working on that with your doctor.
[253:36.38]So, best of luck to you.
[253:39.31]It's not a fucking fun time.
[253:42.77]But, have the strength.
[253:45.09]You will be fine.
[253:46.19]You will figure it out.
[253:48.71]Because it happened to me.
[253:49.91]And I figured it out.
[253:55.98]Wait, why are we... I'm not, like, joking.
[254:03.26]Why is everyone saying that was like a joke?
[254:05.43]I wasn't like joking around there.
[254:06.89]Come on.
[254:11.04]But thank you, Frosty Wolverine.
[254:13.48]I wish you the best.
[254:15.64]King of Wales, thanks for the bits.
[254:16.94]Thanks for the $1.
[254:17.30]Okay, but what about the story of the old bones?
[254:19.10]Alright, the story of the old bones is the guy fucking went on a boat and he shot a cannon in the wrong direction and he shot himself in the fucking stomach and he flew like 500 feet off the boat and he got eaten by fucking piranhas.
[254:31.01]That's the story.
[254:31.57]And his bones sank to the ocean and they got turned into fucking dust.
[254:36.34]Thank you.
[254:36.70]No soup for you for the $1.
[254:40.04]After we kill the memes, does that give us mods permission to ban everyone that uses an old meme that was killed?
[254:46.07]Yes.
[254:47.75]I'm taking this dead fucking seriously.
[254:51.97]Whatever fucking memes are killed, they are a bannable offense.
[254:56.43]Like a 30 minute timeout if you use them again.
[254:59.59]You're going to get one.
[255:00.31]Whoever wins the fucking rumble, that's it.
[255:06.45]I see any of the other ones pop up.
[255:08.16]That's 2017 memes.
[255:08.88]You're going to get fucking banned.
[255:10.40]You're going to get timed out for fucking 30 minutes.
[255:14.54]Better use them while you can because you only got like another fucking two and a half weeks before they're all gone.
[255:22.27]Lindsay, thanks for the two bucks to wrap it up.
[255:24.11]Sorry for making chat bully you by bringing up crypto.
[255:26.89]No, that's alright.
[255:27.63]We're all just fucking laughing about it a little bit here.
[255:30.45]It's fine.
[255:32.65]We're good to go.
[255:33.79]Thank you, Lindsay, though.
[255:34.86]And thank you, everybody.
[255:35.54]Thanks to all the subs.
[255:36.82]All the new subs, all the old subs.
[255:38.00]There's a lot of people that are fucking... There's a lot of people now that have been subbed to this channel for years at this point.
[255:47.56]It's actually kind of insane to me.
[255:50.74]Thank you.
[255:51.50]There were some 20-month subs that came in today.
[255:55.40]More than that.
[255:57.82]Thank you so much, everybody.
[256:02.87]And with that, that's going to wrap it up.
[256:05.35]I will see you guys on Thursday.
[256:07.98]Plan for the Christmas decoration stream to be either Thursday or Friday.
[256:11.10]Probably Friday, but it might happen Thursday.
[256:13.04]Depends on how much I can get it done.
[256:16.20]Have a good night.
[256:17.36]See you soon.
[256:18.01]Take care.
[256:19.93]Goodbye.
[256:59.47]Thank you.
[257:34.43]No, there's no joke.
[257:39.04]I just accidentally pressed a button and it made a sound.
[257:41.60]Everybody thought it was going to be a joke.
[257:45.80]I accidentally pressed a few buttons.
[257:49.09]I'm sorry.
[257:49.95]I really got everybody's hopes up.
[257:57.47]Tactical joke.
[258:00.65]Everybody just thinks there's gonna be a joke every stream and it's just not gonna happen.
[258:05.17]I'm sorry, everybody.
[258:07.27]But you have to fucking understand.
[258:11.01]Of course there's gonna be a joke at the end of the fucking stream!
