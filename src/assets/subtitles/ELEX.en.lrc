[ve:60.16.100]

[01:16.47]Hey, how are you guys?
[01:20.99]Welcome to a... Welcome to a Wednesday stream.
[01:26.33]Not a typical thing we do on Wednesday, but still doing it nonetheless.
[01:31.67]Uh, we're gonna play Elex tonight, or Elex.
[01:35.97]Elex, I'm not sure how you actually pronounce this game.
[01:40.59]Looks very interesting.
[01:43.54]It's got pretty bad reviews, but it's apparently kind of a cool idea.
[01:50.53]And who knows?
[01:51.95]There's guns.
[01:53.25]There's swords.
[01:55.75]It's steampunk.
[01:57.13]It's set in, like, the wilderness.
[01:59.02]It's set in the Ice Age.
[02:04.08]It's, you know, who knows?
[02:09.46]So we're going to be chilling out, having a good time.
[02:14.84]For only probably like a couple hours.
[02:19.50]I can't tell you exactly how long this stream is going to be.
[02:22.67]But I have to get up and catch a plane tomorrow, because tomorrow is TwitchCon.
[02:28.19]So we'll see.
[02:29.75]Maybe you only might get a couple hours out of it.
[02:33.69]So give me one minute.
[02:34.59]We'll get this started.
[02:36.65]We'll see you guys in like 60 seconds.
[03:25.42]And that's all the time we need.
[03:29.88]I'm curious.
[03:30.34]Should I use a controller for this game?
[03:33.08]I don't know.
[03:33.40]Is this one of those games that was made for PC, but then they made it for other platforms?
[03:37.18]Or is this only for PC?
[03:38.15]Should I use keyboard and mouse?
[03:41.03]That I'm not sure.
[03:43.55]This game did just come out.
[03:44.69]It came out like two days ago.
[03:45.93]Or yesterday.
[03:51.97]No, use it with a Wii mode.
[03:53.25]Controller?
[03:55.65]No, God, don't do... Is there, like, a hotbar?
[03:59.57]We'll try it with mouse and keyboard first.
[04:01.11]And if I hate myself, then... We'll go to controller.
[04:09.24]Anyways, this is Elex.
[04:14.14]God, no.
[04:16.13]Well, I don't know.
[04:17.03]I got a controller right here I can plug in if it gets bad.
[04:21.01]Although, the tutorial is gonna, like, teach me shit.
[04:24.93]Hmm.
[04:29.43]Why am I playing this?
[04:30.47]This game needs more patience than Gothic.
[04:32.63]Your ADHD is going to destroy this.
[04:36.35]Well... Oh well.
[04:45.72]We'll just go keyboard mouse.
[04:47.04]I can always just fuck it up later.
[04:48.84]Let's go.
[04:50.83]Easy, Normal, Difficult, or Ultra.
[04:52.89]I feel like these are graphic settings.
[04:55.15]Do you have an easy computer or a normal computer?
[04:57.00]A difficult computer, because they're like, okay, so this is somebody that built a computer themselves.
[05:01.86]You know, it was hard for you to build that computer.
[05:05.37]This is a Best Buy computer.
[05:06.55]This is an e-machine from Walmart.
[05:09.64]And this is enthusiast.
[05:11.02]You got like a 12 core PC in here.
[05:13.44]Like three people had to make this computer.
[05:16.34]This is one of those sponsorship computers that you see streamers do.
[05:19.31]And that's exactly what I got!
[05:20.59]Oh, that was fucking dumb.
[05:21.59]Playing on ultra.
[05:22.35]I hope I can change that in the options menu.
[05:37.17]And as Magalan fell into darkness, the survivors faced a world that was unrecognizable.
[05:42.71]Don't even have fucking animated CG cutscenes?
[05:44.77]Throw it in the garbage can.
[05:48.79]New factions arose.
[05:51.05]The Berserkers.
[05:53.35]The Clerics.
[05:56.44]The Outlaws.
[05:57.72]That's me.
[05:58.12]I'm gonna be Jason.
[06:01.55]But it wasn't only the struggle for scarce old world resources that drove them.
[06:05.53]Resources.
[06:06.37]For the comet had bought something new.
[06:08.61]Ultra.
[06:09.83]I'm going to die in one hit.
[06:11.41]Oh, Elix is the name of the resource.
[06:14.75]It could fuel technology.
[06:16.81]Change.
[06:18.31]Oh!
[06:19.41]Open new abilities to those.
[06:21.15]The Frozen Flame!
[06:22.09]Chrono Cross!
[06:23.23]Whoa!
[06:25.74]The Sims!
[06:27.72]I'm gonna every time there's a fucking colored diamond, I'm gonna make a Sims joke.
[06:33.01]Seduced by Elix's power, some began to consume it.
[06:37.32]Addicted, overwhelmed, most degenerated into vicious, mindless mutants.
[06:43.11]What is this accent?
[06:43.97]There were some who could control their addiction.
[06:47.35]This is the lazy southern accent.
[06:49.71]Elix offered strength, focus, and stamina.
[06:53.63]These people called themselves the Alps.
[06:56.91]The Commander's Shepherds.
[06:58.35]This is Mass Effect 3.
[07:00.00]This is Mass Effect 4.
[07:01.06]There's the stock green screen particle effects I know.
[07:18.47]Is that a fucking good eehee?
[07:23.09]I hope it was.
[07:25.64]And his name is Jax.
[07:30.98]So, do me a quick favor here.
[07:32.74]Choose your class.
[07:34.40]Do you want to be that guy, this guy, or that guy?
[07:40.33]Well, one thing this game does is it's very bright.
[07:51.11]Nice fish helmet.
[07:54.17]Uh-oh.
[07:56.03]Watch out for those birds!
[07:59.55]He was shooting the birds.
[08:00.52]He actually was aiming at the birds.
[08:05.08]This is loud too, and I'm very sorry about this.
[08:13.66]You don't survive that.
[08:15.62]You die here.
[08:18.54]Oh, shit.
[08:19.52]It's alright.
[08:20.36]I mean, like, just drop this.
[08:26.24]Okay, what happened?
[08:29.17]I'm perfectly fine.
[08:34.69]It's still... Alright, what were those extra explosions?
[08:37.47]What was this?
[08:37.91]The Joker from The Dark Knight?
[08:39.27]Like, I just had two extra explosions on his entrance.
[08:52.28]Doesn't even need the helmet.
[08:53.50]Helmet didn't do anything.
[08:55.20]Usually there's like a little oxygen and shit.
[08:57.41]No, he just wears it because he likes it.
[09:00.05]Don't need that anymore.
[09:02.17]I'm done with the fucking fish clan.
[09:07.73]Zero to 400 hours.
[09:11.22]Checking my Apple Watch to see what the current price of Bitcoin is.
[09:15.20]Just throw the roof.
[09:15.96]Oh!
[09:22.24]There can be only one consequence for failure.
[09:31.56]Wow.
[09:34.62]We saw the opening... Ah, you got me.
[09:42.70]Right on the edge of a cliff.
[09:45.24]I can't believe I backed up to the edge of this cliff and you got me.
[09:48.49]Why wouldn't you shoot him in the head?
[09:50.46]Shoot him in the head.
[09:51.14]You don't shoot him.
[09:52.48]They shot me in the perfect place in the stomach where I'm not going to die.
[09:55.58]You know what I'm saying?
[10:03.72]That was the spot.
[10:05.00]If you get shot there, you're going to be fine in like two hours.
[10:11.12]Really dirty too.
[10:16.56]I wish I didn't put it on ultra difficulty making a mistake.
[10:24.53]See, there is a hotbar.
[10:25.44]Okay.
[10:25.78]And the sensitivity has to go way down.
[10:27.72]Can we, uh... Can we... Difficulty.
[10:30.84]Difficulty.
[10:31.38]Yeah, we... That was a joke.
[10:33.12]We're just gonna do normal.
[10:37.13]Ultra... I have to turn... Let me turn it up.
[10:41.31]Fix the graphics.
[10:42.21]What are you... There is no... There is no fixing the graphics.
[10:46.92]It's too quiet.
[10:51.48]Hold on.
[10:52.18]Let me fix this shit before we really roll the ball here.
[10:57.51]There's no graphic settings, guys.
[10:59.09]It's just windowed, borderless, 120,000 HHz.
[11:01.13]Alright, let's go like this.
[11:05.85]Bing, bing.
[11:07.54]No, let's go there.
[11:09.74]And then I can just drag this, and that should be good.
[11:15.16]Live remapping, yeah.
[11:18.01]Is that better?
[11:22.80]Oh my god, actually, I have a fucking lead pipe for a weapon.
[11:26.12]Now it's way too loud.
[11:29.30]New missions.
[11:30.20]Survive.
[11:32.92]I wonder which one of the little pigs lives in this house.
[11:39.27]I think it's the smart one.
[11:41.61]Yep.
[11:45.09]He said find a weapon.
[11:45.95]I already have one.
[11:47.50]Louder.
[11:48.14]That's too loud now.
[11:49.42]You understand?
[11:50.36]Now I have to turn that down.
[11:54.68]Here.
[11:55.46]That's okay now.
[11:56.18]Okay, sheath the weapon.
[11:58.68]Yeah, we're gonna stay with the PC controls.
[12:00.46]I feel like it's good.
[12:01.34]I played World of Warcraft.
[12:02.54]I know how to... I'm gonna get a fucking... I'm not gonna get hit one time this whole stream.
[12:06.64]If I get hit one single time, if I take one fucking point of damage, I will delete my entire Twitch account.
[12:15.89]Delete it.
[12:17.13]You understand?
[12:40.34]Combine quick attacks and heavy attacks E E The longer the combo the more damage you deal always keep an eye on your stamina the stamina meter Why would E be a move?
[12:56.15]Giant rat.
[12:57.41]Dead.
[12:58.67]Okay, and now we're removing that caveat.
[13:01.78]You can do this in turn.
[13:03.32]Anybody in the porta potty?
[13:15.44]I was gonna wade my hands through the shit in the porta potty.
[13:18.39]Maybe find a secret key.
[13:20.29]Is this a goblin?
[13:25.95]What kind of fucking rambling?
[13:31.65]Why would I need to fight a regular rat?
[13:35.74]What is this, a bard's tail?
[13:38.72]Jesus, why would you swing that hard?
[13:41.64]I guess now it makes sense you would swing that hard.
[13:43.36]Now here comes like the daddy.
[13:50.11]So it's a target lock.
[13:51.16]Is there like a block or anything I need to know about?
[13:52.84]This game... I have a feeling this is going to be fun to play.
[14:02.80]Just because it's like... It's kind of awful.
[14:07.17]But those are the kind of games that I have the most fun.
[14:11.29]That's all that's here.
[14:15.36]Guarding technology.
[14:16.46]Look, we got a mana.
[14:17.36]You gotta stop doing that shit.
[14:18.80]Pick up the little potion.
[14:20.20]That's definitely a health potion.
[14:22.48]No, it's not.
[14:22.88]Okay.
[14:23.78]What is two?
[14:25.48]I knew it.
[14:26.40]I fucking knew it.
[14:30.07]It is a health potion, so how do I pick it up?
[14:34.85]I can't be holding a weapon.
[14:38.93]Alright.
[14:41.61]Graphics tab.
[14:45.84]play comedy night no I don't want to play comedy night you know what you know what comedy night is I'll tell you what comedy night is comedy night is hey jump in a server and how many like racial slurs can people say to like scream and before the stream gets banned I don't want to play comedy night I thought about it and like it was just like oh my lord I don't want that's that's just no way if you want to be real I'll be real
[15:20.89]It's pretty accurate.
[15:26.51]Console?
[15:26.95]This is not console graphics.
[15:34.00]Very unnecessary.
[15:42.77]I hate how you have to put away your weapon to pick something up off the ground.
[15:47.64]I just picked up an Etalyx, okay.
[15:49.94]One Etalyx.
[15:54.03]Small mana potion, oil lamp.
[15:56.35]There's a take-all.
[15:58.25]Cool.
[16:03.75]Electronic scrap.
[16:04.65]There's gonna be a crafting tree.
[16:08.92]Can I take the chair?
[16:09.62]Come on, please let me wheel around the chair like a fucking goofball in the office.
[16:15.68]That's such bullshit.
[16:20.51]I almost didn't know how to get up from the chair.
[16:23.46]Loot the dead rat.
[16:24.82]Got a bone.
[16:25.52]Let's go.
[16:32.06]Mm-hmm.
[16:33.93]Oh, that's cable.
[16:38.95]What?
[16:39.19]What's... What's... Why is everybody saying graphics?
[16:42.29]It doesn't... They don't even look that bad.
[16:46.04]What's wrong with them?
[16:47.22]Besides the fact that the view distance is like five feet in front of your fingers in front of your face.
[16:51.44]No vaulting.
[16:52.32]Use the elevator.
[16:53.14]Be careful.
[16:53.38]There's no 13th floor.
[17:09.94]Boo!
[17:11.10]Happy Halloween, everybody!
[17:15.10]Not even an attempt.
[17:16.79]Not even an attempt.
[17:18.27]That was not even an attempt.
[17:20.91]That was... Look, I'm tired.
[17:23.47]TwitchCon comes out tomorrow.
[17:26.03]What is it, a video game?
[17:27.07]Evacuation sequence initiated.
[17:32.36]Alright, everyone's freaking out about these fucking graphics.
[17:35.64]What's wrong with it?
[17:37.23]There's Fept of Dield on here.
[17:38.57]There's Ambient Occlusion.
[17:39.53]Everything's on high.
[17:41.63]What else can I possibly do?
[17:42.81]I don't want to put it on ultra.
[17:45.38]If you put a game like this on ultra, it's going to run like shit.
[17:55.12]Vegetarian?
[17:57.11]Is there a fucking high chance that this guy's a vegetarian?
[18:00.45]Yeah.
[18:03.25]I'm not putting it on ultra.
[18:04.27]Yeah.
[18:05.93]Shadow quality ultra... Putting shadow quality on ultra is the easiest way to tank your FPS.
[18:13.78]It is like... What's going on with my legs here?
[18:24.48]You guys are all, like, PC enthusiasts.
[18:27.34]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[18:28.34]This is the fucking beginning of Portal 2.
[18:30.10]So, that's where we are now.
[18:31.22]Take the jetpack.
[18:32.02]Press spacebar... Does it recharge?
[18:32.94]Do I have... Okay, thank God.
[18:34.57]I was gonna see if it doesn't recharge.
[18:35.67]This thing sucks.

[19:35.84]He's back with the cash.

[19:57.92]I have a GTX 1080 already.
[20:01.74]And I love it.
[20:03.00]I love it.
[20:05.45]I'll use it on Radishes.
[20:07.51]Thank you, Ben.
[20:09.11]For the $50.
[20:11.15]I will make sure to buy at least one or two Red Bulls.
[20:15.05]At TwitchCon with that money.
[20:16.50]That's how much they cost now.
[20:18.88]Also, thank you to Styx Renegade for the 342.
[20:22.80]Styx Fun Fact 0001.
[20:23.86]Despite being a compact state, Rhode Island has the longest state name.
[20:29.76]The full name is the state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
[20:33.38]And that's why Rhode Island is the best state.
[20:35.55]Better than Massachusetts.
[20:36.91]Well, you know.
[20:40.43]I mean, that's fine.
[20:42.87]I'm not one of those, like, assholes that defends Massachusetts everywhere.
[20:48.20]Look, I agree with you.
[20:48.92]Like, Massachusetts is, like, stupid.
[20:52.40]Like, what do we got here besides toilet paper and cigarettes?
[20:55.54]I just opened up the Massachusetts locker.
[20:57.84]That's all that's here.
[21:01.59]Are we in, like, a really nice school?
[21:03.45]Because that's it.
[21:06.51]That's it!
[21:10.30]See?
[21:15.49]Is the rat dead?
[21:17.51]No, I like Massachusetts, but Massachusetts is like a really weird place.
[21:21.37]There's a lot of mean people in Massachusetts.
[21:29.10]And they're not very nice, but there's a lot of nice people too.
[21:38.38]Can you give me something more dangerous than these rats?
[21:41.26]I don't want to be killing rats.
[21:44.52]More cigarettes.
[21:47.12]Climb.
[21:52.69]Cool third-person Borderlands mod.
[21:56.15]No, that would imply that Borderlands was good.
[22:01.23]This is the third-person anything else.
[22:04.25]I ain't given any... A hammer?
[22:05.69]Nice.
[22:06.15]Nice.
[22:08.48]I ain't giving any praise to Borderlands.
[22:12.65]Yeah, this is the tutorial.
[22:13.71]It's just teaching us how to pick up, like, duct tape and smoke cigarettes.
[22:18.77]No, you didn't.
[22:19.97]I did.
[22:20.67]You know, I'm old enough now.
[22:21.85]I told you guys, like, a couple streams ago.
[22:25.53]When you get to be, like, an old fuck like me, like, I don't have to, like, pretend like I like Borderlands.
[22:32.01]I can just be like, Borderlands is fucking terrible.
[22:36.95]And everyone can just be like, oh, it's just Jeremy.
[22:39.17]He's, like, old and weird.
[22:40.33]Alright, look.
[22:43.61]Wait.
[22:44.67]Alright.
[22:45.45]We're going to sneak up on this guy and smash his head.
[22:52.16]This is the first real enemy.
[22:54.10]See?
[22:54.82]It's going to do it for me.
[23:03.92]I thought I was just dead.
[23:07.11]What a terrible, terrible stealth assassin attempt.
[23:10.99]Why would you... Okay.
[23:17.48]That punch noise was perfect.
[23:21.79]No, no, don't do, like, the Mass Effect fucking character, like, camera angle.
[23:25.79]I'm gonna have a bunch of dialog options.
[23:27.05]Don't do it.
[23:27.71]Don't do it.
[23:28.17]Don't do, like, The Witcher 3 two-character fucking story thing.
[23:30.59]Don't do it.
[23:31.57]Ah!
[23:49.33]I don't apologize for nothing, asshole.
[23:52.19]Delete jail.
[23:53.67]Especially not you.
[23:56.37]Oh god, now it's like I took a telltale game.
[23:58.84]Who cares?
[24:00.36]We're playing full-on chaotic evil in this.
[24:02.26]Which means you just got very, very lucky.
[24:05.50]I can help you find a safe place and new equipment.
[24:08.41]If you stop trying to attack me, why would you help me?
[24:11.89]that's my job I look for people out here and help them reach goliath you'll be safe safe you could be some kind of slavery I want this war to be over until then goliath needs more people to survive and people need a safe place to go well a safer place than being out here on your own
[24:34.34]But you're welcome to stay and risk being picked up by an alberating party between them and the rotbores.
[24:41.03]You won't live long.
[24:42.53]Say, you didn't see anyone else up there in the ruins, did you?
[24:45.59]You're the first person I found this trip, and it would save me a trip up there to check.
[24:50.66]No, I didn't see anybody.
[24:53.34]That's not a lie.
[24:54.14]I actually didn't see anyone.
[24:56.13]You said not to trust anyone, so why trust my answer?
[24:58.81]Who did I see?
[24:59.31]Huh.
[25:00.45]I guess you're right.
[25:01.09]Oh, the guy that shot me.
[25:01.97]Still, I reckon you'd have mentioned if there was anyone else still up there, seeing as you're looking for people yourself.
[25:08.06]Yeah, well, we can... Cold increased.
[25:10.54]What you're gonna do?
[25:13.04]Depending on what this guy says, my temperature changes.
[25:17.00]You can find work to earn enough to buy equipment.
[25:19.20]Oh, nice.
[25:19.84]If you want a chance to survive, it's the best offer you'll get.
[25:23.62]That's why I joined the Berserkers.
[25:25.88]Out here, drifting and hoping to stay alive.
[25:29.26]I knew it was only a matter of time before my luck ran out.
[25:32.61]I know joining a faction doesn't appeal to everyone, but... I don't join factions.
[25:37.91]And what have you got to lose right now?
[25:40.05]Nothing from what I can see.
[25:41.23]He's wearing a mood ring?
[25:47.58]It sounds like you've been brainwashed.
[25:49.76]I'll turn on subtitles in a minute.
[25:51.82]Cold decreased?
[25:53.00]Why is my body temperature changing by the mean sentences I'm saying?
[25:56.80]You also look cold.
[25:57.88]You look cold.
[26:06.26]Whatever you've done before, your life can start again.
[26:10.08]It must be a reputation.
[26:11.29]When the next Al rating party comes down from the north looking for Elex, the people of Goliath will defend you.
[26:18.27]You won't see the inside of a converter with us to protect you.
[26:21.02]Can a fucking tree just fall on this guy?
[26:22.72]Instead, you get a chance to prove yourself.
[26:24.82]To join us.
[26:26.28]Why do you want to help me?
[26:27.92]Alright mission Goliath needs people warriors cultivators hunters storekeepers Whatever your skills we can find a place for you Okay, is there just like a leave me alone button No You'll train me and give me equipment
[26:48.18]He's only got three arrows.
[26:49.72]What's happened to my hand?
[26:50.46]Something happened to my hand earlier.
[26:52.66]I got electrocuted.
[26:54.13]This is like right click to skip dialog?
[26:55.35]Stay or go?
[27:15.61]What if I leave?
[27:16.23]No.
[27:16.29]That's what I do.
[27:17.11]Mm-hmm.
[27:17.25]Nope.
[27:17.37]Mm-hmm.
[27:17.65]Okay.
[27:17.79]Uh, yeah.
[27:42.58]I will come with you to Goliath.
[27:44.02]I will come with you to Goliath.
[27:45.16]I will come with you.
[27:45.82]Follow me.
[27:46.68]And if we lose each other for any reason, you'll find Goliath to the east.
[27:50.39]The foot of the mountain.
[27:51.23]Okay, that's the east foot of the mountain.
[27:53.81]You can see that from a good distance away.
[27:56.21]Oh, and the name's Duras.
[27:58.03]Pleased to meet you.
[27:59.07]Nice to meet you too.
[28:00.49]Just lead me there.
[28:01.53]Keep up.
[28:02.59]Keep your eyes open.
[28:04.03]We're entering the hunting grounds of some of the local wildlife.
[28:06.76]Actions like sprinting, attacking, and if it costs stamina.
[28:09.59]Yes, I know.
[28:10.45]Trying to... If this guy hasn't figured it out.
[28:21.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:22.15]What is this random shit here?
[28:23.69]Hold on.
[28:24.07]Is it a... Rusty Axe.
[28:26.73]Okay, hold on.
[28:27.33]I want to put that on.
[28:30.61]Rusty Axe.
[28:31.31]Damage 22.
[28:31.99]Nice.
[28:33.27]Nice.
[28:35.49]Nice.
[28:38.47]It's gonna, you know, it's gonna take too long to kill him.
[28:48.59]I'm just like moving.
[28:51.75]That's how far it was.
[28:55.15]You could have just pointed.
[28:57.25]You could have literally just turned your body around and pointed and said, it's right there.
[29:05.74]Needed to follow him.
[29:06.74]I sure did.
[29:10.18]Uh, I've... Let's go.
[29:15.69]Follow him to the ruins.
[29:21.93]No, get... Okay, don't click on him.
[29:28.56]Plenty of like fucking pac-man balls everywhere.
[29:30.64]This is the this is a pretty cool the pac-man.
[29:33.01]We're in an alien planet the packs are a Reminder that the past can be left behind Can we find we're gonna have to go in the ruins I know I
[29:51.78]Maybe.
[29:52.04]Maybe.
[29:53.34]Sorry, I have split personality disorder.
[29:57.31]I argue with it.
[29:57.89]I gotta turn on fucking subtitles.
[30:02.45]Where is it?
[30:02.95]Gameplay.
[30:05.78]Status screen.
[30:06.56]Radar.
[30:07.00]Actions.
[30:07.36]Tutorial.
[30:07.90]Focus.
[30:08.24]Highlight.
[30:08.56]Enemy.
[30:08.88]Level.
[30:11.37]autosave every three minutes.
[30:13.81]Damn.
[30:14.13]Well, that was their plan.
[30:16.41]Instead, they ran into a group of rotbores.
[30:19.85]Got chased into those ruins and haven't come out.
[30:23.15]Alright, um, the only good enemy is a dead enemy.
[30:25.37]Those rotbores saved you a job.
[30:26.93]Even eaten by rotbores, that's no death for a warrior.
[30:29.63]Hey, maybe they're alive.
[30:30.51]Haven't you checked?
[30:32.25]Maybe they're alive.
[30:33.65]Can I just send him in there and just hope he dies?
[30:36.92]Yes, well, maybe you're right.
[30:39.23]Yes.
[30:39.41]You just told me that they existed.
[30:40.76]We just talked about it.
[30:41.94]You can't rush that.
[30:56.27]I'm going to join.
[30:57.03]Stop questioning me about my business or I'll get angry.
[30:59.92]Darius finds you a bit odd.
[31:01.36]We're going to get angry.
[31:03.50]You won't like me when I'm angry.
[31:06.10]I'm just like that green guy that's on those Marvel movies.
[31:09.62]Alright, what do I do?
[31:10.68]Press V.
[31:26.54]strength alright so what are we doing here strength and represents your physical power melee damage this is toughness physical conditioning permanently increases life and unlocks items and abilities says that's life decks are we gonna be like a dex loser we're gonna do like are we doing decks range damage oh come on we actually I can't do it increasing intelligence permanently increases mana
[31:56.37]Cunning.
[31:58.05]Influences social skills.
[32:02.81]Well, it's either melee or guns.
[32:04.81]I don't know which... I don't know what's the one to pick in this game.
[32:10.39]I can't take... Can I remove points from intelligence?
[32:17.40]I have 10 attribute points.
[32:22.56]Melee?
[32:22.74]We're going to have to get a pull here.
[32:27.92]Yeah, I'm going to get a straw pole in here.
[32:33.10]Because this is important.
[32:39.77]Oh, we can go STR or DEX.
[32:41.61]I feel like I'm playing Dark Souls.
[32:48.65]Get your straws ready.
[32:52.91]Because I might play this.
[32:54.70]Once I get home from TwitchCon, we might continue.
[32:56.52]If this is funny and fun and interesting, I might continue to play it.
[33:02.54]Still pretty close.
[33:03.36]Dex is going to win.
[33:05.06]Need a third option.
[33:05.94]There is no third option.
[33:11.71]All constitution.
[33:12.77]Just walk into rooms and get hit.
[33:16.53]It won't be fun.
[33:18.55]Let me catch up on some bits here.
[33:19.83]Tara, thanks for the two bucks.
[33:22.84]Can you comment on the rumor that your first real name is Dennis?
[33:28.14]People aren't talking about it.
[33:29.36]Dennis?
[33:29.74]Where the hell are you getting Dennis?
[33:32.03]My actual full legal name is Arnold Elbertson.
[33:36.97]I don't know where you're getting Dennis from.
[33:40.63]Arnold Elbertson.
[33:42.69]Reaper500, thanks for the five bucks.
[33:45.03]Hey, Jerma, when you go to TwitchCon, can you have your intro sound be your catchphrase from TV Superstars?
[33:51.61]Intro?
[33:52.09]I don't have... I don't have an intro.
[33:55.03]What do you mean?
[33:55.53]Like, would I get introduced?
[33:56.73]There's like 4,000 partners going.
[34:00.03]If they introduced all of us coming into the building, that would be the whole convention.
[34:03.91]And then everyone would go home.
[34:07.30]That would take like seven days to do that.
[34:10.30]But thanks.
[34:10.68]Obviously, thank you, Ben, for the 50 bucks.
[34:13.32]Mostly lost thanks to the $5.
[34:14.54]I'll give you 50,000 bits if you actually delete your Twitch.
[34:19.74]Um, well, unfortunately, most of the loss, I think my Twitch account might be worth more than 500 bucks.
[34:27.47]My Twitch account's worth at least, like, at least, like, six to seven million dollars.
[34:37.42]Alright, looks like we're going Dex.
[34:40.68]By a very small margin.
[34:42.30]Dex it is.
[34:43.70]Like this even matters.
[34:48.32]It's worth at least five to four, five to six million dollars.
[34:54.59]Who cares?
[34:55.01]Just buy it all.
[35:00.95]I was just laughing.
[35:02.19]Yeah, come on.
[35:03.65]Do you have any idea?
[35:04.63]Let me tell you this.
[35:05.43]Let me explain this to you guys.
[35:07.14]If I went to a random company that didn't know anything about Twitch or YouTube, and I went to a financial advisor, and I was like, let me ask you, what's a valuation on 700,000 people on a YouTube channel?
[35:14.96]He'd be like...
[35:24.11]He'd be like, oh, well, Mr. Howard, Mr. Elbertson, I just accidentally said your actual real last name, your channel is worth six to seven million dollars.
[35:34.55]And I'd be like, of course it is.
[35:35.69]You can't even hurt friendly NPCs, so it doesn't matter.
[35:48.00]Ooh, combat, melee weapons, ooh.
[35:52.66]Was it the same guy that told me to invest in Pop Rock?
[35:58.38]My, like, real name.
[35:59.48]Like, who cares about real names?
[36:01.98]You know, in real life, I don't... I call Etalyx in real life Etalyx.
[36:08.05]I don't call them by his actual name.
[36:09.99]It's strange.
[36:12.09]Let's see.
[36:14.01]Like, first and last names are going to go away in, like, the next two to three zero years.
[36:20.07]20 or 30 years.
[36:23.35]I'm gonna go range weapons.
[36:27.65]Heavy weapons?
[36:28.19]Okay, you need a lot of constitution to do heavy weapons.
[36:33.04]People call me Jerma.
[36:34.00]I call people, like, I call people Etalyx.
[36:35.92]Yeah, I call people Etalyx.
[36:39.42]Let's do heavy weapons.
[36:45.49]No, let's... Let's do this.
[36:47.79]Let's make this easy.
[36:50.79]I can't... Why can't I... Come on, learn... Oh, learn the Combat Trainer.
[36:53.41]Okay.
[36:56.46]Two-handed.
[36:56.82]I don't have any weapons.
[36:57.78]I have just a Worker Pants.
[36:59.18]Put those on.
[37:02.78]Potions.
[37:03.34]Yeah, I have six of them.
[37:04.86]Mana.
[37:05.08]I don't need mana right now.
[37:06.11]Survive.
[37:08.33]Alright, let's keep moving.
[37:18.84]Let's go ahead.
[37:19.26]Let's go into the ruins.
[37:20.18]Let's just do this.
[37:21.04]Let's get this over with.
[37:24.46]Also, thank you.
[37:25.06]Ben Elnor before, like 25 minutes ago, gave another 20 bucks.
[37:29.87]And he says, happy, happy, joy, joy.
[37:31.87]Well, thank you for the 70, 80, 90 total dollars.
[37:33.19]Because he also gave 20 bucks before and said, damn graphics dough.
[37:35.85]So, Ben, you've given like $100 again.
[37:46.32]I really hope you're a fucking oil tycoon.
[37:48.64]Because you're up there.
[37:50.96]Way up there at this point.
[37:55.58]Just kill him.
[37:56.26]I wish I could.
[37:57.08]I want to go to the Goylan.
[37:58.34]I got to go to the Goylan.
[37:59.54]I really got to drop a two.
[38:01.83]You took the easy path?
[38:02.45]Good.
[38:02.55]What's the fastest way to get me the fuck out of the tutorial?
[38:19.74]Also, Rogue Sniper, thanks for the bits, and Leferl.
[38:23.69]There's a Shadow of Haze.
[38:24.85]No, this is... Even these monsters are in Gothic.
[38:28.41]Use Quickscope!
[38:31.73]You can parry or evade an attack.
[38:35.29]Yeah.
[38:37.39]What?
[38:39.37]Oh.
[38:41.73]That guy doesn't even know.
[38:43.25]Oh, no, we gotta get a good view of that.
[38:44.45]He's gonna get attacked!
[38:49.81]Jesus how do I like not lock on to this guy?
[38:55.65]I don't want to be locked on Okay, now they're fighting on the bridge When is that gonna stop?
[39:15.42]He still hasn't noticed
[39:19.75]Now he's in the game.
[39:24.13]Nice.
[39:25.06]Good swings.
[39:28.62]How good is he?
[39:31.94]He's very good at rolling around.
[39:41.85]I'll take care of this.
[39:43.59]You keep being a random asshole.
[39:47.45]Every attack adds to your combo bar.
[39:48.85]With enough combo power, you can perform a special attack.
[39:51.25]It's a Q button.
[39:55.21]Alright, we did it.
[39:55.95]Let's go.
[39:58.75]Time to delete.
[40:02.15]No, I told you that that was over.
[40:03.91]That caveat was done.
[40:05.10]Oh, God.
[40:11.60]I'm so caught up on this.
[40:13.11]I want to find... Let's just go.
[40:14.87]Let's hurry up and go to the fucking Goliath now.
[40:16.59]Next.
[40:16.75]Do not know.
[40:17.23]This is what you're getting tonight because this is a short stream.
[40:22.59]And then I'm going to get my first gun.
[40:41.60]The voice actor for this game, they showed him a picture of Geralt.
[40:55.45]Come on.
[40:58.35]You can kill these fucking Dark Souls 1 bosses.
[41:01.67]It's the Bell Gargoyles.
[41:08.44]Can I see his health?
[41:11.22]Does he have health?
[41:20.97]They have sick sleeveless shirts on.
[41:22.69]Yeah, they really do.
[41:26.25]Anyways, so they showed this guy a picture of Geralt.
[41:31.51]And they said, do that!
[41:34.19]And he was like, okay, fine.
[41:40.66]Look at this turkey!
[41:42.62]Let me tell you something, Durros.
[41:51.57]Don't you ever sign up for intimidating shout competition.
[41:57.03]Because you'll lose.
[41:59.07]You'll lose very, very, very, very, very poorly.
[42:03.44]Yeah.
[42:06.70]Thanksgiving!
[42:08.62]It's coming up soon.
[42:10.82]I can't wait.
[42:11.46]I'm gonna put so many giblets.
[42:13.30]I'm gonna put so many turkey sandwiches I'm gonna put like there's how I make my turkey sandwich.
[42:18.71]Who cares about this dumb fucking game?
[42:21.27]It's one piece of bread one small layer of mayonnaise
[42:26.54]on top of that small second layer of mayonnaise, but this is a cranberry mayo.
[42:32.34]What you do, you take a little bit of cranberry sauce from the can, the jello shit, you mix it with a tiny bit of mayonnaise so it's spreadable.
[42:39.54]Get that up- Shut up, I'm trying to talk.
[42:45.76]So then after that, one layer of mashed potatoes, small layer, third- fourth layer now.
[42:53.39]Fourth layer is...
[42:56.36]Stuffing.
[42:57.84]Sticky stuffing.
[42:58.63]You don't want the fall-apart stuffing.
[43:00.03]You don't want the shit that's like breadcrumbs.
[43:02.25]You want the sloppy, like Stouffer's sticky stuffing.
[43:05.93]Layer number five.
[43:07.85]Turkey.
[43:09.11]Two slices.
[43:09.83]Don't go more than two.
[43:11.09]That's too much meat to stuffing to potato to cranberry to mayo to cranberry mayo to bread ratio gets off.
[43:20.04]Close it up with the last piece of bread.
[43:22.38]And if you don't do it like that, then you're in
[43:25.58]That's all you need to know.
[43:27.44]Dersh doesn't like you anymore.
[43:30.08]But, but.
[43:37.71]No gravy?
[43:38.39]No, no, no.
[43:38.57]You get a gravy au jus.
[43:39.53]I didn't say that part yet.
[43:41.85]Get a little cup.
[43:42.33]Dipping gravy au jus.
[43:43.49]Oh, to mark your next mission.
[43:44.27]This one.
[43:44.49]Mark it.
[44:10.31]That way.
[44:24.59]Okay.
[44:26.92]Let's go.
[44:32.40]Let's get in that water.
[44:36.70]Drink a little bit of that molasses.
[44:39.58]Can I dive?
[44:42.49]Fell into a puddle.
[44:43.17]Yeah, this is one of those games that's programmed that if there's any water, fall damage doesn't exist.
[44:49.09]Something going on up there.
[44:51.62]Looks like there's a fight.
[44:52.32]Velociraptors versus the Jurassic Park.
[44:55.14]Heroine, what's her name?
[44:57.32]Dr. Gilbert?
[44:58.92]Dr. Gilbert, it's me!
[45:00.60]Bald guy!
[45:02.76]Oh.
[45:03.86]You're not Dr. Gilbert.
[45:06.09]Ah, goddammit.
[45:07.93]No, here comes a fight.
[45:08.69]At least there's a fight.
[45:13.42]You guys can't do this shit!
[45:15.35]Yes, my minions!
[45:16.29]Go down and kill them in my first-person, third-person strategy game!
[45:25.57]I really don't have to do shit.
[45:27.23]Oh, now I do.
[45:27.85]I can't even hurt these guys.
[45:34.76]Do the special move!
[45:41.68]Huh?
[45:51.73]At least it saves every three minutes.
[45:57.61]The end.
[46:01.94]I'm gonna conserve this stuff.
[46:04.78]Don't fight those guys.
[46:05.80]That's not gonna work.
[46:10.92]It's because I leveled Dex.
[46:12.26]I know, and I like... Remember?
[46:14.82]I get a lot of shit on this stream for listening to chat.
[46:18.21]But come on, like the next time, the next time, like, alright, let me tell you something.
[46:21.91]Let me tell you something, guys.
[46:23.87]The next time that Twitch has like a fucking Streamo Awards where one of the nominations is most interactive with chat streamer or chat interaction streamer, I'd better be on that fucking list.
[46:39.45]Like, most decisions made by Twitch to a streamer.
[46:42.94]I better be one of the nominations.
[46:44.12]I don't even care if I win.
[46:44.82]I just want to go and get the free fucking banquet dinner.
[46:47.38]I don't care if I win.
[46:54.24]I just want that free fucking, like, $80 plate.
[46:56.22]Let's get rid of this.
[47:01.44]Let's get rid of this Star Fox enemy.
[47:06.32]We missed.
[47:12.65]Do a special move so I can see what it looks like.
[47:14.17]Alright, I'm doing this painfully wrong.
[47:20.95]The combat, you know, I'm gonna tell you, the combat is... I gotta learn how to, like, dodge.
[47:35.16]How do I dodge?
[47:36.16]It's like this way, right?
[47:43.50]You can't, like, mash in this game.
[47:45.05]I'm gonna die.
[47:46.25]Is this still an ultra difficulty?
[47:47.57]Can I, like, pretend it is?
[47:48.49]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[47:56.49]That took way too long.
[48:00.16]Uh, anyway, so, uh, Ben came in with another $50.
[48:04.94]Strawpole tells no lies.
[48:08.12]No lies.
[48:09.00]Well, Ben, thank you, dude.
[48:12.23]Plus 10 EXP.
[48:17.07]Thank you so much, Ben Eldor.
[48:23.60]These guys are so much easier.
[48:25.78]Are they?
[48:30.92]I don't think I can fight more than one thing at a time.
[48:35.87]Okay, you tap a direction.
[48:37.29]I get it.
[48:37.77]Am I drowning?
[48:43.82]I can't I can't get off target lock.
[48:46.46]How do I unlock my target from some?
[48:55.24]How do you fucking get off target lock I don't understand Is there a map This is where I need to go up here Listen, I just gotta walk this way.
[49:10.63]I need to get a gun and we got to go over here.
[49:12.33]Oh
[49:16.92]That's the marker.
[49:18.89]So what's the quickest way?
[49:21.59]No, that's school.
[49:23.51]Down here is military base.
[49:25.65]Over here is Puccini, right?
[49:31.10]And then this is like Brojack Horseman or something, right?
[49:37.63]That's across the whole map.
[49:43.61]PUBG, that's right.
[49:45.39]Okay.
[49:46.05]Look, I have to make PUBG references because I'm on twitch.tv.
[49:51.26]I gotta stay relevant.
[49:52.24]I'm constantly researching what's I currently in.
[49:54.64]I'm constantly watching streams and paying attention to the different channel memes.
[49:59.28]Okay, I can't go over there.
[50:02.10]Those guys are gonna kill me.
[50:08.22]Natural Elix.
[50:09.84]Interesting.
[50:12.13]Pack of...siggy butts.
[50:17.57]And I know that people always say, like, Well, don't drop down at military base.
[50:23.03]Don't drop down at school, you're gonna get destroyed.
[50:27.01]I've seen that before.
[50:30.25]So, obviously, I can't go over there.
[50:33.54]I need a gun.
[50:34.32]Can I make a gun?
[50:35.34]Can I just shoot those guys?
[50:38.80]We're gonna avoid them.
[50:44.36]They're not gonna see me, are they?
[50:46.02]Is there a sneak button?
[50:47.59]What the fuck?
[50:50.89]Don't auto target lock.
[50:52.15]I gotta turn that off.
[50:58.03]This game came out in 2017.
[50:59.65]There's definitely a crafting menu.
[51:02.22]Are you kidding me?
[51:03.98]You don't think this is a full-on crafting menu in this game?
[51:06.92]It's a 2017 release.
[51:08.18]Of course it's gonna happen.
[51:14.56]Oh, goddammit.
[51:16.98]That hurt SO much.
[51:19.50]Do you see how much damage that just did?
[51:24.86]That was half of my whole health.
[51:26.94]This is- I don't think this changed off of Ultra.
[51:29.20]I think I have to restart the game for that to happen.
[51:31.25]Alright, back on the road.
[51:36.05]There is some kind of fucking mutant right here.
[51:39.73]That I'm not prepared to fight.
[51:44.28]What in the name of God is this shit?
[51:48.49]This game just got way cooler.
[51:49.93]This game just got five times cooler in 100 feet.
[51:55.14]Wow.
[52:00.78]I'm kind of like...
[52:17.84]It's okay.
[52:19.98]We stood here long enough.
[52:21.32]Oh god, but I'm like locked on.
[52:24.04]Oh my god!
[52:29.69]I'm actually fucking scared.
[52:31.77]That was actually... It auto-saved right before I got killed.
[52:34.97]Good.
[52:36.99]Oh, come on.
[52:38.23]And why are they chasing me?
[52:41.73]Wait.
[52:42.85]Alright, we just fell off the fucking mountainside.
[52:45.92]I don't think they come this way.
[52:47.85]Their AI is too stupid to follow me down.
[52:56.63]Come on.
[52:58.43]Your AI can't be smart enough to do this shit.
[53:01.01]I just want to go to the town.
[53:05.97]Alright.
[53:07.05]That's enough.
[53:08.05]I've had enough of this.
[53:10.39]We're fine.
[53:12.03]That's it.
[53:12.69]There's just a fucking frog snake.
[53:18.80]I'm going to such uncharted territory.
[53:24.02]Please, they can't just be a gun lying on the ground somewhere here.
[53:29.34]I would take anything.
[53:30.14]I would take a pistol.
[53:32.46]I would take a revolver.
[53:34.88]I would take a magnum.
[53:36.44]Anything.
[53:41.68]Alright, this is fine.
[53:42.64]How close are we?
[53:44.36]How big is this map?
[53:46.29]It's absolutely fucking enormous.
[53:48.29]Uh...
[53:50.96]Well, welcome to the stream where we just walk on the road and try not to die to get to this town.
[54:04.09]Get up there.
[54:06.13]Yeah, I... Okay.
[54:12.06]I don't... This game is... It's a little rough around the edges.
[54:17.86]And by rough around the edges, I mean, if you were to touch this with your bare feet, you would slice him open.
[54:25.64]But look, as long as you're, like, okay, like, putting your bare feet on this, with gloves on, then I think you're gonna be alright.
[54:37.74]I can take these things.
[54:39.74]Me and that nameless main character could do it before, so why not?
[54:52.90]Okay.
[54:53.91]Well, that's good to know.
[54:55.91]Now we... Now we... No, this ball's gonna kill me.
[55:02.63]Thank God it didn't.
[55:09.46]Is this thing broken?
[55:10.54]Or is this just like all the other Gothic games where...
[55:16.53]I'm so dead.
[55:19.47]What happened to me?
[55:20.97]What happened to me?
[55:21.51]I was in the air.
[55:23.03]I was, I was clearly in the air.
[55:27.54]Just keep drinking.
[55:33.61]This is a Gothic game.
[55:35.53]It's the same developers, guys.
[55:37.81]This is supposed to be happening to me.
[55:40.28]The game is punishing.
[55:42.30]It's deadly.
[55:43.82]It doesn't fuck around.
[55:45.60]It doesn't give you instructions.
[55:47.22]It just says, deal with it.
[55:51.64]Welcome to Gothic, guys.
[55:53.15]They're not going to follow me all the way up here, are they?
[56:03.53]Go back to Goylet.
[56:05.60]Their monsters are pretty cool.
[56:10.62]We're almost there.
[56:14.82]Those are some really interesting monsters.
[56:16.48]And I'm guaranteed to die.
[56:18.89]I told you.
[56:20.67]I already knew it.
[56:21.45]I already knew I was going to die.
[56:22.55]I guaranteed it.
[56:29.31]Look at that thing's ears.
[56:35.23]Oh my... Where's the... Where's that fucking asshole?
[56:39.21]What's his name?
[56:39.75]Barry?
[56:41.39]Jax?
[56:42.92]What was that guy's name?
[56:45.54]Is it in here?
[56:47.68]It's in here.
[56:50.08]Where is he?
[57:02.83]So the game doesn't pause when you're out.
[57:05.39]The game does not pause.
[57:12.01]Wait a minute.
[57:13.13]I think I'm able to get inside this shed.
[57:16.87]It's not a shed.
[57:18.84]He won't be able to reach me from here.
[57:21.86]Look, there's a cache in here.
[57:23.84]Perfect.
[57:24.64]It's okay.
[57:26.86]There's a weapons chest, I think, right there.
[57:29.16]That's why they put these scary monsters here.
[57:54.87]This game is fun.
[57:56.07]It is.
[57:56.47]Like, I might not be the best person to be showing you this game.
[58:01.50]But, I mean, come on.
[58:03.88]Do you want to play a game that you show your friends and be like, hey, look, friend.
[58:07.12]Look at how fucked up this game is.
[58:14.55]Where's the death counter?
[58:17.37]That's a good question.
[58:18.11]But anyways, let me like actually do something for real.
[58:20.41]It's back here, right?
[58:24.39]I want to set a marker here.
[58:25.75]This is where I was, right?
[58:27.07]Have I lost my goddamn mind or is that where I was?
[58:30.47]Because I fell down a hole.
[58:33.11]Yeah, no, is that... Are those bad guys just sitting there?
[58:41.12]There's two things right here.
[58:42.36]I don't know what it is.
[58:46.04]What is it?
[58:49.60]Nothing important.
[58:50.40]I think it's over here.
[58:51.04]Yeah, it is.
[58:52.68]Yep, yep, yep.
[58:53.24]Going the right way.
[58:58.51]Why would I show myself like that?
[58:59.83]What a fucking bonehead mistake that was.
[59:01.59]That was an absolute bonehead mistake.
[59:05.64]Ah, no, no, no.
[59:07.72]That's one hit to die from these guys.
[59:09.00]Alright, thank god they're also humans so they can't run that fast.
[59:18.36]Look, in a world where there's also humans, human V. human, you ain't gonna beat me there.
[59:30.09]I'm glad they added this, though.
[59:33.13]This makes things much easier.
[59:36.71]Come on, let me get back to fucking Goylet quick.
[59:40.37]No, don't!
[59:41.23]Not right now.
[59:41.95]Can I drink in the air?
[59:49.21]Where the hell am I going?
[59:50.29]It's up here.
[59:50.77]Thank God.
[59:51.78]Although, didn't I tell this guy to go, like, fuck himself?
[59:55.64]I think I did.
[59:56.10]Is he gonna let me in?
[60:07.09]Hey, mission complete.
[60:08.51]Survive.
[60:09.21]Is that guy marrying me?
[60:10.27]I think this is... Uh, Duras sent me here.
[60:13.13]Yeah, look.
[60:14.29]You see that boar over there?
[60:16.97]I was about to cry if that thing was attacking me in the cutscene.
[60:32.50]Okay, I got entry.
[60:33.46]That's fine.
[60:34.58]I have a rusty axe.
[60:36.22]I don't care.
[60:36.74]Take it.
[60:36.94]Don't flash anybody.
[60:37.36]Okay.
[60:37.46]Wait, flash technology?
[60:59.17]Did I just get, like, the Universal Studios ride, don't take any pictures of Jaws?
[61:03.85]Is that what he just told me?
[61:04.65]Alright, get out of my way, please.
[61:09.55]Yeah, you took my weapons, didn't you?
[61:11.39]Alright.
[61:32.94]Just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[61:34.38]I just was curious.
[61:37.98]Get rid of this rusty axe.
[61:41.98]Who can I buy something from?
[61:43.28]I don't have any money, do I?
[61:49.41]Town's nice.
[61:50.47]Looks, you know, identical to the first town in Skyrim.
[61:55.17]Let me get that for you.
[61:55.92]Let me help you with that.
[61:56.74]We have nothing to talk about.
[62:01.04]Do people get angry if you put your weapon out?
[62:04.80]No stealing, huh?
[62:08.16]Make sure you don't steal anything.
[62:10.22]Okay.
[62:14.51]Don't steal anything.
[62:16.91]Stealing's my middle name.
[62:25.72]It's like I like the best weapon in the game.
[62:30.26]I just picked up the best two-handed sword in the whole game.
[62:38.82]That was Excalibur.
[62:41.63]Look at this thing, 41?!
[62:46.43]Honest day's work, my ass.
[62:48.13]Take the forbidden mug.
[62:51.31]Oh yes, take the forbidden ashtray!
[62:54.54]Look out for the ghost that used to inhabit that ashtray.
[63:01.33]He died from smoking cigarettes.
[63:06.03]That's locked.
[63:14.33]Sleep until midnight.
[63:16.27]I can sleep in the... Who sleeps like that?
[63:20.17]Did you see that?
[63:20.91]What the fuck?
[63:25.03]If you sleep like that, I don't trust you.
[63:32.60]No, I'm not sleeping.
[63:34.10]I'm sleeping in the mug.
[63:35.14]Can I sit on the bench?
[63:40.28]Is that illegal?
[63:42.84]I need a gun.
[63:46.90]Is there a crouch button?
[63:50.88]No.
[63:50.98]Do you have a gun?
[63:54.52]Wine?
[63:57.00]Bag of elixir?
[63:58.88]Is this a tooth extractor?
[64:00.60]No, I need a gun.
[64:03.03]Oil lamp.
[64:04.23]Do you have any guns?
[64:04.87]I'm here to trade.
[64:07.79]Magic.
[64:07.97]It doesn't sound like you're getting help you deserve.
[64:10.02]I don't care.
[64:10.62]What do you have to trade?
[64:25.55]You can take a look.
[64:26.55]The selection is more limited.
[64:29.85]I need better weapons and armor.
[64:32.27]I need better weapons.
[64:33.79]I can't help you.
[64:34.65]You can only get that sort of thing from our blacks.
[64:37.00]But he'll only sell to berserkers.
[64:39.40]Or I can just take it.
[64:41.68]A good few shards for sure.
[64:44.18]I've got to work my ass off.
[64:49.89]You must have something to offer apart from shards.
[64:52.83]I don't have four charisma apparently.
[64:55.53]Teach me something.
[64:56.47]Teach me something.
[64:57.65]Of course.
[64:58.45]Huh?
[64:59.47]You can spend your... Ah, learning.
[65:02.33]Learning points.
[65:03.17]This is where you learn.
[65:04.34]Okay.
[65:08.00]Get 10.
[65:09.16]I think I want 10 attribute points.
[65:14.28]If only it was a dex check.
[65:15.48]Bookworm.
[65:16.44]Personality, zero.
[65:17.52]How do I do this?
[65:22.56]Teach me something.
[65:23.84]Of course.
[65:25.21]I have two learning points why can I not use them I have a personality zero do I do I need personality points oh god damn it I have to like pay you money and have a ton of points I can't do any of this yet
[65:54.57]Fuck you.
[65:54.91]I'm going to take your iPad game match three wine.
[66:04.75]Got it.
[66:06.29]See you later.
[66:10.05]Yes, you have to exchange goods for services.
[66:12.29]I know.
[66:12.93]Can I steal that weapon?
[66:16.60]Okay.
[66:18.60]I want to go to the blacksmith so I can just steal a gun.
[66:22.34]I thought that was a person on fire.
[66:25.35]One of you assholes has to be a Dex person like me, right?
[66:29.07]Nobody in here?
[66:30.23]Usually, like, Skyrim had the eyeball that told you that you could see somebody.
[66:36.84]Bag of cultivator's loaf.
[66:45.74]Okay, look, we're just gonna keep taking things.
[66:47.36]Oh, a broom.
[66:50.49]Shit!
[66:52.17]Shit!
[67:08.26]Where was that last save?
[67:11.73]Thank God it was right here.
[67:12.91]Who even saw me do that?
[67:15.59]Nobody even...
[67:23.32]She's a fucking crossbow.
[67:24.94]God damn it.
[67:30.34]I need that crossbow.
[67:40.49]I wanted to use the broom as a melee weapon as a joke.
[67:45.19]Who's saying to get out?
[67:46.01]There's nobody here.
[67:48.26]Hey, get out.
[67:49.42]Oh, that's the guy that's saying get out.
[67:51.16]Okay, mother, go.
[67:54.20]Take the pot roast too.
[67:56.68]What are you doing here?
[67:59.68]What are you looking for here?
[68:00.68]A bed.
[68:03.77]One of these things.
[68:10.89]I wonder if this is possible.
[68:12.11]Let's try this one last hypothesis.
[68:15.55]I'm a scientist.
[68:16.99]I'm a video game scientist, guys.
[68:20.57]No, get up.
[68:21.75]No, you stupid asshole.
[68:23.19]I wanted to take the wine and then go to bed.
[68:25.69]We're going right back to bed anyways.
[68:28.37]I'm going to take one of the beds.
[68:30.83]She's been sitting there the whole time watching me.
[68:33.49]Go to bed, quick.
[68:39.66]I can't fucking go to bed while I'm being attacked.
[68:41.58]Save me.
[68:42.34]This woman's a mad woman.
[68:48.70]Alright, let's go.
[68:49.22]I can't believe I got the snakebiter, though.
[68:54.84]I'm looking for the blacksmith.
[68:59.93]Because we're going to do every single means necessary.
[69:05.11]Every possible scenario where I could take stuff.
[69:08.06]Okay, here we are.
[69:08.74]This is the blacksmith, right?
[69:11.36]No, this is a tavern.
[69:13.14]Boring.
[69:16.35]Once I get a crossbow, I'm going to headshot this guy.
[69:23.95]No.
[69:24.05]I'm just passing through.
[69:26.11]I did steal a sword, a huge one.
[69:27.83]Okay, goodbye.
[69:28.59]That's what I need.
[69:29.20]Oh, there's a ranged weapon.
[69:46.49]Imagine if I could just turn this around and aim it at one of these guys.
[69:58.57]Then you got a solid 10 out of 10 video game for me.
[70:02.62]Where's the blacksmith for crying out loud?
[70:10.52]Nope, they're not happy about that.
[70:20.95]What?
[70:21.91]What did I do?
[70:26.01]I didn't take any pictures with any cameras.
[70:28.71]Oh, technology.
[70:30.27]Okay.
[70:32.03]Me flying around is technology.
[70:35.07]They don't like technology here.
[70:45.58]For a game that's supposed to be steampunk, this sure is more like gothic than it is steampunk.
[70:55.40]Okay, just get me a gun somewhere.
[70:57.72]Go to the blacksmith and weapons and armor.
[70:59.78]I wish I knew where that was.
[71:02.26]It's definitely not there.
[71:05.74]Wait, it might be.
[71:06.58]It might be in one of these little holes.
[71:08.98]If I were a blacksmith, I'd be living down here.
[71:14.96]Is somebody sleeping in here?
[71:18.34]This has nothing to do with Steambunk.
[71:21.24]Look at the box art.
[71:23.98]The box art for this game has a guy with a rifle.
[71:28.90]I'm telling you, there's some weird technology explosion.
[71:31.50]Mars smashes into Jupiter.
[71:34.36]And everybody gets a melee weapon and a gun.
[71:41.40]Well, that very clearly to me is that that's a mug.
[71:48.36]That's a mug.
[71:53.68]Whatever that means.
[72:02.12]oh god and what is your crime um what I am warlord ragnar patron of this berserker settlement what's your crime is on pilgrimage anyone who commits a crime must answer to me emissaries from the other communities also have to speak to me first I like you know games like this are interesting sometimes why are you here speak but like I'm nobody just faceless man
[72:28.52]We're all playing games.
[72:30.38]Indeed.
[72:30.86]You need to, like, grab me quick.
[72:32.28]Grab me.
[72:32.52]I need... I'm looking for work.
[72:34.20]I need to protect... I need... I need...
[72:51.84]Let's do a mission.
[72:52.58]Let's do one mission.
[72:53.61]There is more than enough work to go around.
[73:00.41]So if you want to be tolerated here, you must follow my rules.
[73:04.37]I wish the fantasy armor didn't look so blatantly out of place next to tech.
[73:07.75]You harm the Berserker community.
[73:09.17]That'd be cool.
[73:09.85]You will pay.
[73:11.03]If you serve the community, you will receive fair compensation for it.
[73:15.96]That's fine.
[73:18.14]Yeah.
[73:19.28]That sounds like... You're the boss.
[73:21.02]You're the boss.
[73:21.98]Yes.
[73:22.44]Did I just join a faction?
[73:23.38]I might have.
[73:23.96]The quicker you... Need my advice, and you will find the Berserkers.
[73:27.88]Is there anything...
[73:29.37]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:30.21]Where can I, where can I buy, where can I get armor like you?
[73:32.25]Where can I buy armor?
[73:34.61]You can't simply, you don't even have the rank of a cultivator.
[73:39.43]Okay.
[73:41.43]He's so online, he could be.
[73:43.98]Slow down, friend.
[73:47.26]Make yourself useful in the city.
[73:50.06]Assimilating foreign property.
[73:51.64]Alright.
[73:57.34]Damn it.
[74:00.24]These are the same starting quests in every single Gothic game.
[74:05.08]Well, I mean, you gotta prove yourself.
[74:09.24]I don't know if I trust you yet.
[74:11.90]Why don't you do me a favor and walk around and talk to the locals?
[74:15.92]Come with me, she's thinking more and... Head on over to the blacksmith.
[74:23.85]I wish I could just take this bow right off this guy's fucking back, I really do.
[74:30.10]Alright, should we go to the weird tower up there?
[74:39.11]Use the campfire?
[74:39.97]Oh, I can make some fried meat.
[74:42.28]That sounds good.
[74:44.14]Oh.
[74:45.04]Delicious.
[74:49.16]Cultivator?
[74:51.64]What is that?
[74:53.03]No, that's like a kitchen knife.
[75:00.17]I'm just waiting for, like, crossbow.
[75:02.45]You know what I mean?
[75:03.69]That's all I care about.
[75:04.73]Let's just get this over with and get to the mission start point, wherever it is.
[75:09.10]It's up here.
[75:14.40]I can't open up a map?
[75:16.48]Are you guys that fucking deprived that I can't use a map?
[75:23.21]Wow.
[75:23.85]Okay.
[75:26.69]No maps!
[75:33.67]Let's put on the giant... Let's put this on.
[75:37.35]I don't have enough strength.
[75:38.59]Oh, god damn it.
[75:48.38]I need... This is strength and dex.
[76:05.63]We'll get there soon.
[76:13.11]You can't put, like, big, scary, crazy fucking monsters everywhere and then have me walk around and talk to fucking Renaissance people.
[76:23.53]You know what I mean?
[76:24.37]Like, I understand that you have to have, like, a skill tree and a crafting system.
[76:30.09]But I was just about to take that.
[76:34.17]Storybook don't steal my storybook, please Alright, you know technology is forbidden by law here Cinder charisma trip don't fuck and everyone always talks about how I can't use technology.
[76:52.90]Nobody does anything about it Fuck you I'm out of here
[77:03.27]Renaissance encourages tech.
[77:04.73]These guys are Amish.
[77:06.97]So what is the quest that that guy just gave me?
[77:11.57]This one.
[77:12.15]The first and easiest thing to acquire is better equipment, a good weapon, and basic armor are priorities.
[77:17.16]Mark that on the map, please.
[77:21.70]Where is that?
[77:24.95]Right here.
[77:29.25]I want to make sure I'm... It's right here?
[77:30.89]Okay.
[77:32.31]Let's go.
[77:32.63]Apparently, it's right here.
[77:34.71]I'm standing on... The guy's in this room.
[77:40.37]Okay.
[77:41.87]This is a perfect opportunity to steal.
[77:44.19]Absolutely.
[77:46.92]Without question.
[77:48.64]This is a great place to take whatever I want.
[77:54.06]So, look around, guys.
[77:56.22]If you see, we're gonna play like I spy with my little eye.
[77:59.70]Do you spy a crossbow?
[78:03.08]Or a gun?
[78:08.40]All these guys are sleeping.
[78:12.79]A lot of brooms I've noticed too.
[78:16.89]Wrinkle, is this stealing?
[78:18.05]It didn't say it was forbidden.
[78:24.01]It just said it was a letter.
[78:25.77]None of this stuff is forbidden.
[78:26.75]None of this stuff says forbidden.
[78:27.99]Isn't that what that means?
[78:33.12]Alright, let's... Where is he?
[78:36.82]No, not you.
[78:37.86]You.
[78:39.34]Not you.
[78:42.14]Oh, the guy on the fucking giant dragonstone throne.
[78:44.57]Let's go.
[78:47.05]Let's assume I help you.
[78:48.09]Okay.
[78:48.73]Game's really going into the goylet right now.
[78:50.23]Uh, free as a bird.
[78:51.05]Uh, yes.
[78:51.29]Takes a gun to confront me, which is something you don't have.
[79:14.71]Many things to be done.
[79:15.87]Now people are dedicated, but we still have supply.
[79:18.21]Get us some food, medicine, machines.
[79:19.81]But no technology.
[79:20.65]God damn it, Gothic.
[79:21.13]You couldn't just tell me to go pick up like three bushes and like kill a couple of boars?
[79:42.16]Departure... Let's do it.
[80:06.43]It's a lot to ask.
[80:07.21]I want some money.
[80:10.62]Okay, let's go.
[80:16.82]I got a mission.
[80:18.52]Let's go do it.
[80:19.00]The mission is contact.
[80:25.10]There are some albrators in the area that could be useful to me, or they could report me to Zakkor.
[80:30.78]I can look to get equipment and information in Goilid or find the albs, but if I find the albs, I might have to fight them.
[80:39.44]You got it.
[80:40.16]Let's go fight.
[80:40.74]Let's go play with your tech somewhere else.
[80:43.34]Look, I have to do this because I need to fucking mark it on my map where I'm going.
[80:49.62]That's been marked, right?
[80:53.72]Where is that?
[80:55.54]Right there.
[80:56.82]That's the next part of the mission.
[80:57.98]Oh, yeah.
[80:59.88]I'm so stern looking.
[81:01.16]Get out of here.
[81:03.78]You fucking backhead.
[81:08.06]What is it?
[81:08.34]Some kind of a monument?
[81:13.15]Alright, that was fucking disrespectful.
[81:14.52]I'm sorry.
[81:15.24]That was like disrespectful.
[81:18.16]Let's go.
[81:19.42]Is somebody just cocking a bow at me?
[81:31.75]We're almost out.
[81:32.67]We're almost ready to start our first mission.
[81:35.73]And like the stream's not even going to be for that much longer because I have to go get ready for TwitchCon.
[81:41.73]We might have to go back to this if we get started.
[81:46.67]Wrong mission.
[81:47.71]No, that's the Al- that's the- that's the Alba outpost.
[81:50.87]That's where I need to go.
[81:51.45]That's the one that's currently being marked.
[81:54.48]That's- that's the one right here.
[81:55.76]Contact.
[81:56.76]There are some Alba raiders in the area.
[81:58.50]They could be useful or I might have to kill them.
[82:02.58]And there's a purple... There's a legendary here somewhere.
[82:08.44]Or an epic.
[82:09.00]Oh my god, this game is epic.
[82:19.38]That's the easiest way to cross a ditch.
[82:23.45]Alright.
[82:24.57]Let the games... ...begin.
[82:29.59]As Dr. Karazhan would say.
[82:30.97]No, no, that's not, that wasn't, Dr. No, what, no, no, no, Medivh.
[82:42.16]That's not, his name wasn't like Mr. Karazhan.
[82:45.70]Am I gonna have a panel at TwitchCon?
[82:47.36]No.
[82:52.03]I'm not going to have a panel at TwitchCon.
[82:54.10]I'm not gonna do anything about... Look, I was thinking about maybe doing a panel.
[83:00.36]I think it'd be fun to... Not one of those typical TwitchCon panels, and you know the ones I'm talking about, like, in quotes.
[83:09.08]Strengthening your community!
[83:10.54]How to get started.
[83:13.38]Where do we go from here?
[83:15.74]Branding and you.
[83:18.98]Like, who fucking cares?
[83:21.15]I was gonna do a PowerPoint presentation where I talked about a bunch of fucking nonsense.
[83:35.61]I still only have... I want to use that new weapon.
[83:42.37]Halfway through my presentation, there was going to be just hundreds of pictures.
[83:46.25]There was going to be like hundreds of pictures of like animals and shit.
[83:50.03]And I was going to just skip through them all.
[83:52.13]And be really like nervous and embarrassed about it.
[83:54.22]Alright, well at least I have points in strength now.
[83:57.44]So this might, yeah, it's going to go much more smoothly.
[84:04.24]That was much easier.
[84:12.35]Skip TwitchCon and go to the casino.
[84:13.93]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[84:19.36]My TwitchCon panel would be... Me pretending to do one of those.
[84:25.10]And then halfway through it turns into something else.
[84:26.80]And then halfway through that it turns into something else.
[84:30.08]But I never acknowledge it.
[84:32.22]I would have like eight different panels in one panel.
[84:34.45]And it would be titled something like...
[84:41.67]Imagine if I just did, like, a how-to gamble.
[84:43.49]I don't think they'd let me do that, though.
[84:48.93]Like, when to hold him, when to fold him.
[84:51.57]With jermaOn 8-5.
[84:53.31]Teaching you the blackjack strategies.
[84:56.96]Just move the deck of cards, like, fumbling around with, like, a fucking shitty lapel microphone on.
[85:01.94]Like you see what you do here is you when the business if the deal is showing is six Make sure you you always want to make sure you don't hit because they'll bust Alright, I gotta play the game again, hold on Hold on gotta play the game And special move oh god, come on Okay, I gotta like jet pack up there and get him

[98:36.60]God damn.
[98:45.29]What is your total at, Ben?
[98:47.05]I'm curious.
[98:48.39]I know you're never supposed to ask a person about their income, but what are you at total bits?
[98:53.60]It's got to be something fucking high at this point.
[99:01.17]Very, very, very, very, very generous of you, man.
[99:09.16]What did I eat for lunch?
[99:12.42]A chicken sandwich.
[99:15.50]Can I not fucking blow this again?
[99:17.04]Like, we're not doing any jokes or anything.
[99:19.89]I do have to kill these things, I think.
[99:21.25]Yeah, I do.
[99:22.35]So, make it count.
[99:29.47]I mean, you don't really have to show me this anymore.
[99:33.67]Oh my god.
[99:34.45]Please.
[99:36.25]Are you serious?
[99:37.91]Are you serious?
[99:40.01]Are you serious?
[99:43.51]This is like... Alright.
[99:46.36]I am certain that we're on ultra difficulty and it didn't turn down.
[99:57.14]I'm certain.
[100:01.86]This is normal?
[100:03.04]It can't be!
[100:06.96]What is Ultra like then?
[100:10.70]What is Ultra difficulty like?
[100:19.37]Like that.
[100:26.22]Ultra increases- Ultra makes fall damage.
[100:38.10]Let's go back.
[100:42.21]See, it's all normal.
[100:43.05]It's like it never happened.
[100:45.35]Alright.
[100:45.93]No more fucking around.
[100:46.81]I'm not gonna goof around anymore.
[100:48.97]We're actually just... We're gonna do this.
[100:51.85]If you came here hoping to see gameplay of this game, I'm very sorry.
[100:55.22]We've been dicking around this whole time.
[101:00.42]No more fucking around.
[101:01.52]No more goofing around.
[101:05.50]Let's actually... Let's do the mission.
[101:11.61]I always say that it never happens.
[101:15.07]You know, you're right.
[101:17.35]But... You're not gonna be right this time.
[101:24.80]Yeah, I'm out of stamina.
[101:36.74]Seems to have a very... Gotta wait for the turkey to do the turkey move.
[101:48.19]I don't know any stamina.
[101:51.65]Okay, please be dead.
[101:55.75]Is that a chicken?
[101:56.35]It's a turkey.
[101:58.01]Alright, it's a turkey wannabe.
[102:03.79]Say some... That guy was waiting for me.
[102:05.90]We're gonna just save it.
[102:09.52]003.
[102:14.38]Why does a prompt have to come up every time I attack it?
[102:16.60]Who the fuck are you?
[102:20.11]Okay.
[102:20.21]Um... Are you trying to scare me?
[102:21.05]I'm in the late game zone?
[102:22.39]How would I be in the late game zone?
[102:24.01]Didn't I just start the game and walk like five feet in one direction?
[102:49.18]What curse?
[102:49.54]The curse.
[102:50.24]The mutants that come to this place, they're drawn to me.
[102:53.46]That's my curse.
[102:54.86]I watched a whole berserker patrol ripped to pieces by them.
[102:59.21]I was the only survivor.
[103:00.73]He's right.
[103:01.17]Stop playing.
[103:01.67]I thought it was just dumb luck.
[103:03.37]But when I was sent to the seedling fields to recover, mutants got through the defenses.
[103:07.67]All were killed but me.
[103:09.29]Wherever I go, the mutants follow.
[103:15.20]Are you threatening me?
[103:16.64]Are you threatening me?
[103:18.30]Threatening?
[103:19.20]I am the mighty Cornholio.
[103:21.12]I need TP.
[103:22.74]There's a low-hanging fruit right there, guys.
[103:25.54]It sounds like a you problem.
[103:26.70]Why didn't you bring a weapon?
[103:36.77]I did.
[103:37.13]I had a club, but I lost it the second time I went in there.
[103:40.25]Well, the follow-up question, why do you have a club?
[103:43.81]Say, if you're going in there, could you look for it?
[103:47.91]You want me to go get your club?
[103:48.97]You want it, you get it.
[103:51.09]I'm only asking you to look out for it.
[103:52.21]How is the game?
[103:52.67]Is it any good?
[103:53.19]It would be no extra risk for you, but it could save my life.
[103:56.33]It's like excruciatingly hard.
[103:58.85]At least for me.
[104:01.81]I'll find your club.
[104:03.31]We're on ultra difficulty.
[104:04.90]It's in the pit by the converter.
[104:08.98]scratch your back alright well this just got weird by the way you like down oh come on I will right right I'll be waiting here I can't even kill the guy with no weapon
[104:44.36]It's not gonna work we're gonna leave leave now while you can It's what that was pathetic actually pathetic At least I don't give a shit if this guy sees me take his shit, yeah, give me your drone dickhead You didn't you didn't even register this with the faa I'm confiscating that I'm gonna sleep in your sleeping bag until tomorrow
[105:14.37]Yeah, you would just sleep on the ground.
[105:15.83]Okay, let's go.
[105:31.28]This is like... I can't even hurt these guys.
[105:36.64]And I'm only getting like 10... Look, okay.
[105:38.80]I can... I could understand...
[105:44.53]If these guys gave like a bunch of... Please get him.
[105:54.28]Get him.
[106:00.62]That guy didn't have a weapon.
[106:04.56]Help!
[106:09.88]Another area?
[106:10.54]Yeah, I feel like something's wrong here.
[106:16.80]Why would you give me this quest at the very beginning of the game?
[106:21.82]They could be useful to me or they could report me.
[106:23.40]I could look to get equipment and information or find the Albs.
[106:26.43]But if I find the Albs, I have to fight them.
[106:28.39]Okay, well what about the other one?
[106:32.97]So like... We're going to do this one, I guess.
[106:41.96]Free as a bird.
[106:46.62]This one.
[106:47.44]I guess.
[106:55.46]Scroll down?
[106:56.26]What do you mean scroll down?
[107:02.05]Um... Corrin lost his weapon while escaping some creatures here.
[107:11.43]Assimilation of foreign property.
[107:15.89]Isn't that, like, the one that I want to do?
[107:17.73]I think that's right, right?
[107:22.45]I mean, that's... I only got, like, three missions.
[107:32.54]Yes, he is the highest viewers for the game and I wanted to see how it plays.
[107:35.88]I'm so sorry.
[107:38.38]I'm so sorry you genuinely, like, want to... Like, let me... I want to do this guy... I want to do this person a favor.
[107:44.30]Alright, let's take a step.
[107:45.12]Ready?
[107:45.97]This is, like, the menu.
[107:46.67]We got, like, the options here.
[107:48.49]You get your various video options.
[107:50.65]Now, this is for you.
[107:51.29]This is for that guy that was asking about, like, stuff.
[107:53.31]I'm serious.
[107:53.81]Because, like, I would be curious, too, right?
[107:57.23]You can use controller.
[107:57.98]You can use mouse.
[107:58.78]You can set the difficulty.
[107:59.58]We're on ultra.
[108:00.66]As you see, we're on ultra right now.
[108:03.06]Um...
[108:06.43]This is all fine.
[108:07.17]This all works.
[108:08.65]One is, you know, you take, you shoot your weapon.
[108:10.83]Weapons have, like, durability.
[108:13.88]Left click is attack.
[108:14.62]E is a strong attack.
[108:19.54]There's a follow-up attack.
[108:21.60]You can do Q. It plays, it's pretty sluggish.
[108:26.24]It's a pretty sluggish game.
[108:28.15]But very deliberate, you know.
[108:30.35]It asks all the wrong questions.
[108:32.07]But has all the right answers.
[108:35.43]Kind of, in a way.
[108:36.61]If you're confused by what I mean by that... On its own, sloppy.
[108:42.29]But when it's all together, it's actually kind of fun.
[108:46.92]There's velociraptors, there's giant mutants.
[108:51.08]Let me make sure I'm going the right direction.
[108:58.91]Damn, you're telling me that... Hold on.
[109:02.22]Are you actually telling me that this zone up here with the blight underneath is a mission I have to go do?
[109:12.90]These all look like, these look like the harder zones, the higher level zones.
[109:16.18]Doesn't it seem like I should be here?
[109:17.54]In like this spot?
[109:26.63]I'm not going all the way up to like the fucking Satan zone.
[109:37.15]Whatever.
[109:39.83]Which one of those is... This one.
[109:46.81]Get rid of all these markers.
[109:47.95]I have too many markers here.
[109:51.86]Campaign of Vengeance.
[109:52.84]Is that just to talk to this guy?
[109:59.06]Whatever.
[109:59.36]Let's go.
[110:00.28]This is pretty.
[110:07.19]Just go back to Goylet.
[110:08.65]It's the noob town.
[110:09.95]Oh, man.
[110:11.03]Okay.
[110:14.07]Alright.
[110:16.05]Let's go back to Goylet.
[110:19.51]When am I going to play Shadow of War again?
[110:23.61]Maybe when I come back from TwitchCon.
[110:28.90]I still want to play it.
[110:30.94]I still am having fun with it.
[110:32.60]So why wouldn't I?
[110:40.27]Looks like the crash bandicoot jetpack.
[110:47.13]You feel bad?
[110:47.75]I'm disappointed?
[110:48.49]What do you mean disappointed?
[110:50.81]I'm not disappointed.
[110:51.55]I've been having a lot of fun this stream.
[110:55.09]Look, a game doesn't have to be like a 10 out of 10 to have a fun stream.
[110:59.25]We're having a fun stream.
[111:04.23]That always doesn't need to be about the video game.
[111:06.53]It needs to be about having fun.
[111:10.43]And save the damn game before I get one hit killed by something.
[111:19.37]It kinda does.
[111:20.11]I mean, weren't the other games like this too?
[111:28.80]From my understanding.
[111:29.50]Like Gothic 1 and... Got that guy in one hit.
[111:39.25]Don't they open up the whole game to you?
[111:42.41]In like the Gothic series.
[111:45.83]I need to go over here.
[111:47.53]Set the marker there.
[111:49.63]Purple.
[111:50.49]We need to go back to Goylet.
[112:02.56]I came here for the Alexa joke.
[112:05.51]This isn't fun.
[112:08.41]I'm sorry.
[112:10.14]But this is all you're getting tonight.
[112:12.40]Because I don't want to start something else.
[112:14.70]This stream was only supposed to be like two to three hours anyways, because I still have to get ready for TwitchCon.
[112:20.40]I have to like pack and... I mean, I have like a suitcase ready, but... I'm already out of stamina too.
[112:32.59]Just run.
[112:37.73]Need to do more Alexa jokes.
[112:42.50]I'm not going to be able to hurt this guy.
[112:43.84]Why am I even trying?
[112:53.58]I'm just going to play mini-golf.
[113:05.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:07.48]Hell, is it... No, where's the difficulty?
[113:16.71]It doesn't even matter.
[113:17.67]It doesn't... Mini-golf?
[113:21.31]What mini-golf games are there?
[113:27.79]Mario go Mario golf was awesome.
[113:29.74]That is a true statement Am I actually gonna go do the quest?
[113:33.64]I would love to go do a quest it but I keep getting one hit killed by almost every enemy And now I have to deal with these guys these like Raiders, okay, I Can't hurt the Raiders either
[114:06.30]It was a traveling merchant.
[114:08.52]Alright.
[114:09.28]Alright, I think we're gonna... I think we're gonna... Yeah, you guys are making the traveling merchant joke when a traveling merchant is gonna one-hit KO me.
[114:24.57]Is all this happening because I didn't go in the cave with that guy?
[114:27.39]This is a Resident Evil 4 joke.
[114:37.30]That's what this was.
[114:38.02]Okay, iron hammer.
[114:43.58]But I can't even use them.
[114:47.40]How much money do I have?
[114:49.24]Where's my money?
[114:50.82]How much is this?
[114:51.31]933.
[114:51.33]3 cents.
[115:02.84]Yeah, that's great.
[115:05.06]I'll kill this animal.
[115:06.76]What?
[115:10.76]That was unfair.
[115:12.54]Let me just get the scraps.
[115:19.43]I'll kill this animal.
[115:24.44]Use the snakebite sword?
[115:26.60]You know, I would love to use the snakebite sword, but I need 60 dexterity to put the fucking thing on.
[115:36.91]And, you know, my ski mask tab.
[115:39.09]It's going to take a little bit more time.
[115:44.44]Just aggro everything near the merchant.
[115:45.76]That's a good idea.
[115:51.86]Let's see how the merchant fares with dinosaurs.
[116:00.49]Actually, you want me to be judge, jury, executioner on this game?
[116:07.00]I will.
[116:08.90]The judge is inconclusive.
[116:11.48]The judge went into the lab and put it under a microscope.
[116:14.13]Inconclusive.
[116:22.52]Because I've... Now this is what I came here for.
[116:25.75]This is what I wanted to see.
[116:28.23]I wanted to see some real fucking brawl action.
[116:32.67]These guys are like level 10.
[116:34.09]We got the giant mutants up here.
[116:35.61]This is exactly what you came here for.
[116:39.71]Let's make it happen.
[116:45.60]Bring it on.
[116:46.76]That's not an animal.
[116:49.16]That's very clearly not an animal.
[116:55.87]I don't know what to look at.
[116:56.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[117:04.92]Is he dead?
[117:13.03]Oh, shit.
[117:14.37]It's just me and the traveling merchant.
[117:17.23]No, it's just these naked guys.
[117:18.93]What the...
[117:21.38]What are these naked clowns?
[117:24.44]No.
[117:35.10]Ah.
[117:48.50]It auto-saved him right here.
[117:51.64]But get him!
[117:59.35]This merch is just fucking bye.
[118:00.95]He doesn't even care.
[118:02.83]This guy has to 2v1 this whole situation.
[118:05.81]Nice save point.
[118:11.78]I don't even think... I mean, they're doing damage, but not very much.
[118:24.32]Guys.
[118:25.86]Guys.
[118:27.24]I'm gonna take all of his stuff.
[118:29.86]Oh, I'm taking all of his stuff.
[118:32.60]That's the game plan here.
[118:34.66]That's the game plan.
[118:36.23]That's the game plan.
[118:41.19]Oh boy!
[118:41.77]Did I get his bow?
[118:43.77]There's two other dead guys.
[118:50.01]I can't pick up the bow.
[118:50.93]What about the other two guys that are dead?
[118:52.31]There's one right here.
[118:58.99]This guy had a loaf of bread and a hundred Brexit.
[119:02.12]Whatever the hell it's called.
[119:02.96]No!
[119:11.23]Why won't they attack those guys?
[119:12.57]Okay, other guy died here.
[119:17.65]Where's his body?
[119:19.49]You gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[119:20.59]Time to run.
[119:24.96]There actually might be something in here though.
[119:30.44]No!
[119:33.88]It's the most exciting thing that's happened to all stream.
[119:38.47]Watch out for that mutant.
[119:44.88]We made it out alive.
[119:49.38]What did I get from that?
[119:55.38]Damn it.
[119:58.21]Are these guys infinite aggro?
[120:02.17]I really hope they aren't.
[120:03.49]No, they're not.
[120:03.97]Okay.
[120:10.05]So what did I get?

[123:54.42]Okay.
[123:55.42]Uh, Zinchen, thanks for the ten bucks.
[123:56.82]Hey man, you've been making me laugh for four years.
[123:58.60]Thank you for all the good times.
[124:00.02]Also, please react like this was a hundred Jerma bucks.
[124:08.75]What just fucking shot me?
[124:11.41]What was that?
[124:14.41]Jesus Christ.
[124:17.05]I just got hit in the face by a comet.
[124:20.31]Okay.
[124:20.62]Okay.
[124:43.50]Ay-yi-yi.
[124:46.96]Those guys apparently have spit spray, too.
[124:49.44]I give up oxygen.
[124:53.94]God.
[124:56.16]Beat the game?
[124:56.82]You want me to beat this game?
[124:57.93]This game might be the hardest game I've ever played.
[125:04.01]What actually hit me, though, that first time?
[125:08.79]What was it?
[125:11.14]I have to be standing in the same spot, right?
[125:12.89]No.
[125:13.75]I got hit in the face by like a blue pulse cannon.
[125:23.40]It was the same thing?
[125:24.52]Was it really?
[125:25.94]The dog shoots like the green shit there.
[125:32.10]God, okay.
[125:33.89]I'm gonna get back to town and we're gonna have a little bit of a discussion.
[125:40.33]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[125:42.79]And Demon's Souls.
[125:44.39]And Demon's Souls.
[125:45.63]Both blind.
[125:47.85]Keep that in mind.
[125:49.97]We didn't use the Wikipedia page.
[125:53.43]We didn't use the Wikipedia page.
[125:55.38]We didn't use the Wikipedia page.
[125:56.80]We didn't use the Wikipedia page.
[125:58.10]We didn't use the Wikipedia page.
[126:00.46]I know, I've seen the video you're gonna make of me when we go on the Wikipedia page.
[126:06.11]Like we got we went on to but out of context if somebody saw that video that you made to slander me They would see that we were just doing that only Only to make sure we that we've getting the right boss all weapons, but I know what you're gonna do You're gonna zoom in quick zoom in quick on that page on the Wikipedia page and on like me using it I
[126:32.24]I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia, I didn't use the Wikipedia,
[127:04.32]Alright, for those of you that... I have a question.
[127:22.41]Can I ask a question in class?
[127:23.65]Am I allowed to ask a question?
[127:34.49]I need to ask... I gotta ask a question.
[127:44.09]Oh, God.
[127:45.11]It's okay, we're fine.
[127:46.57]Okay, let me ask a question.
[127:48.31]So... Why does he... He has a spit.
[127:52.75]He has a... He has a projectile.
[127:55.37]Why does he...
[128:03.23]Those guys don't that he spit blood at me that so every single enemy has a projectile in this game Nowhere is safe everything spits Don't you just hate when you get hit in the face with a fucking meteor So if if we're under the assumption
[128:27.36]I'm going to be under the assumption here that this is like the noob zone.
[128:31.74]This is the noob area.
[128:34.20]What is this?
[128:35.28]That's where I'm standing.
[128:36.44]Aren't I in like the noobie zone?
[128:39.72]I'm confused because to me, we're going here.
[128:44.33]Okay?
[128:45.43]We're going to make it here.
[128:46.59]We're going to make it to the end game.
[128:48.89]I'm going to fucking walk there.
[128:51.13]Because I want to know what the actual end game looks like.
[128:59.64]No, that's really far away.
[129:01.22]No.
[129:01.78]No, I won't... No, you're not.
[129:03.34]You don't think I'm gonna get there?
[129:06.11]I'll get there.
[129:07.25]We're not that far away.
[129:09.67]Set it on the marker.
[129:12.89]I'm determined.
[129:18.03]Determination.
[129:18.71]That was my question.
[129:23.05]My question was like... This is the low level zone?
[129:27.62]Why can I not hurt anything?
[129:30.43]I'm telling you, I missed like the tutorial mission where I went and got like fucking Roderick's hammer, whatever the hell it was.
[129:38.45]I missed something important in the very first mission of the game.
[129:41.39]Remember when we were skipping that guy, we were making fun of his haircut?
[129:45.85]We talked a bunch of shit about the guy's haircut.
[129:51.01]And I missed it.
[129:54.59]There has to be like a gear quest.
[129:59.18]We're walking right into Mordor.
[130:01.93]I skipped the whole mission.
[130:02.93]I did.
[130:03.17]We're almost there, though.
[130:13.85]Just restart the game.
[130:14.85]That actually would be... That would be... Determination.
[130:23.90]I can't restart the game right now.
[130:25.54]Maybe we will in a minute.
[130:30.58]Guys, just have determination.
[130:37.34]Yeah, I listen to Bone Trussell at the gym when I'm working out.
[130:42.51]It gets me that extra two or three pumps.
[130:46.41]Especially when it goes from chiptune to kind of chiptune, but not really with the drums.
[130:57.36]F5 save?
[130:59.18]Yeah.
[131:08.31]That's a screamer.
[131:11.27]I can't hurt this thing.
[131:14.87]Even my character was scared right there.
[131:21.58]Back to the main menu.
[131:22.90]New game.
[131:24.28]Normal.
[131:26.04]Skip it.
[131:28.86]Yes.
[131:29.66]Yeah.
[131:30.38]Yeah.
[131:30.94]We know this.
[131:31.86]We know how this game works.
[131:35.21]Earthquakes shattered in cities Firestorms see planet see that comet that just hit Earth.
[131:41.62]I've been there now.
[131:42.42]I know the story The survivors faced a world that was unrecognizable Fighting amongst the ruins of the old world new factions arose successful berserkers Clerics oh no not the spoons.
[132:00.50]I got there from that random each with their own vision of the future I
[132:05.88]But it wasn't only the struggle for scarce old world resources that drove them.
[132:09.89]Damn it.
[132:10.71]For the comet had bought something new.
[132:14.11]Oh, well.
[132:14.80]Elix, an element unknown to Magellan.
[132:19.03]This was fun, though.
[132:20.19]I had fun with the grown-up Chucky doll.
[132:22.15]That was fun.
[132:22.69]So if you guys want to check out this game, go to Steam, Steam Elix, and check it out.
[132:43.62]You want to be able to hop on whenever you get a chance.
[132:48.24]$49.95.
[132:48.26]It's pretty cool.
[132:49.06]Uh-huh.
[132:49.20]I will tell you this, though.
[132:50.42]Like, for real.
[132:51.18]Without... I'm not gonna...
[133:12.38]I'm not going to sugarcoat anything here.
[133:14.82]The game's not good.
[133:16.74]But it's one of those games that has enough there.
[133:21.36]And it's such an extremely strange challenge.
[133:25.63]Especially the first hour here.
[133:27.61]I could see a lot of people liking this game because of how sort of jagged it is.
[133:36.17]And how difficult and strange it is.
[133:38.75]I could see it.
[133:45.64]I was just going to hold up a fake check.
[133:48.64]Like, and pretend it was the studio that gave me the money.
[133:52.08]But then I realized, my, like, routing number is on that.
[133:55.50]That would be a terrible idea.
[134:00.66]Hey, like, I got paid to say that.
[134:02.85]Oh, yeah, there's my bank account number.
[134:05.65]That would have been real dumb.
[134:11.17]Yeah, he plays his VR game.
[134:15.43]Just print out a fake one.
[134:16.51]We saw this.
[134:17.07]Why is there no audio here?
[134:25.35]Alright, we're gonna make the same jokes we made before.
[134:27.25]Alright, here comes this, like, WWE entrance.
[134:30.15]Where he gets the extra fireworks.
[134:33.03]Here it comes.
[134:35.28]Ready?
[134:37.18]Here it is.
[134:44.32]Let's read some bits.
[134:49.03]This is going to play out.

[136:30.12]I'm not... That's a goddamn degenerate.
[136:34.81]No, thanks, dude.

[136:50.90]I'm the same way.
[136:51.92]Take arrow... Did this just give me a...
[136:57.36]Why am I playing this like I've never played it before, like I just started?
[137:00.10]And I'm trying to use the jetpack that I don't have.
[137:04.18]How does that apply?
[137:06.49]It applies because it means...
[137:23.57]bad.
[137:23.79]It's not a bad game.
[137:24.77]It's not.
[137:25.73]I promise you it's not.
[137:27.75]There's enough here.
[137:28.43]Not for $50.
[137:28.85]Wait for it to go on sale.
[137:31.93]Wait.
[137:32.61]Don't worry.

[137:41.19]You'll probably like it.
[137:44.93]If you really think it's terrible, it's not. ...
[137:52.78]I said the game wasn't good.
[137:53.68]So?
[137:55.78]That doesn't mean I don't respect it.
[137:56.97]Wasn't I looking for one of these?

[144:40.65]I have a lot of friends that I talk to that I listen to what they say.
[144:50.31]I have plenty of friends and a lot of them have stopped talking to me because they tell me that there's a lot of issues with me talking over them and not letting anybody speak.
[145:01.94]I've been banned from Christmas and banned from Thanksgiving before because I don't let anyone speak.
[145:07.71]If I'm in the room, I talk.

[147:28.36]I've been to PAX.
[147:29.28]I've been to E3.
[147:31.03]I've been to those conventions before, but nothing like this.
[147:34.67]I didn't go last year because I didn't feel like I should have gone last year.
[147:40.69]Really, it's this full year here where I've actually been like a quote, a streamer.
[147:48.17]Where I've streamed, you know, on a weekly schedule more than, you know, more than like 12 to 15 hours a week of streams.

[148:45.81]No, it was about like, it was about like penises and stuff.

[148:58.46]Uh, Ghoul Camp, thank you for the five dollars.
[149:01.34]Streamer still has his mom tuck him in at bedtime.
[149:05.98]You wouldn't do that.
[149:07.62]If you had access to a mom, you wouldn't be like, mom.
[149:15.16]By the way, even at like 30 plus years old, I still say it like that.
[149:19.69]Did you guys notice that?
[149:22.25]Even post 30.
[149:24.61]Mom.
[149:26.67]Hey, ma.
[149:29.77]That's not going to change.
[149:30.39]I'm going to be like 70 years old.
[149:31.71]It's still going to be like that.
[149:37.85]I can't even do it.
[149:40.21]Your voice will not change either.
[149:41.89]Even at like 70.
[149:42.73]Hold on.
[149:43.03]Wait, we got something going on here.
[149:47.07]No, never mind.
[149:48.25]He's gonna get rid of him instantly.
[149:49.67]I was wrong.
[149:52.05]I was wrong.
[149:55.51]Even at like 75 years old, your voice will never change.
[149:58.26]You can have this old fucking man voice.
[150:01.42]And where's my... I'm looking for my glasses.
[150:05.54]Has anybody seen my... I gotta see my mother.
[150:08.62]Hey, Ma?
[150:09.18]Do you know where my glasses are?
[150:13.20]It's never gonna change.
[150:15.28]By that point, my mother would be like 140 years old, so hopefully she's still there.
[150:18.86]That would be great.
[150:21.40]But thanks.
[150:23.26]Also, Dan with Wings, thanks for the five dollars.
[150:25.88]Is this the Fallout 5 beta?
[150:30.84]This game really is just Fallout, isn't it?
[150:32.50]It's just Fallout with more rats.
[150:38.11]But, no.
[150:39.07]Thank you for the five bucks, though, dude.
[150:42.15]WetSauce, thanks for the bits.
[150:43.27]This game seems really intense.
[150:44.75]Oh my god.
[150:45.31]Good luck.
[150:45.85]Watch out for the rats.
[150:47.67]It is.
[150:48.85]There's one positive I can say about this game.
[150:50.82]It's very dangerous.
[150:54.14]And that's it.
[150:55.68]It's an intense, dangerous game.
[150:59.40]Uh, that caped guy, thanks for the one dollar.
[151:04.28]I love how you always defend games against the relentlessly pessimistic Twitch chat.
[151:08.24]Heart.
[151:09.40]I mean, that's true to some extent, but, I mean, if you were here for the Evil Within 2 stream, I, uh, I was not, uh, I was not nice to that game.
[151:18.42]I was not defending that.
[151:20.49]I was the pessimist.
[151:22.67]I was the negative Nancy there.
[151:24.31]That was, I did not like that game.
[151:30.63]But thank you.
[151:33.78]And I think that's it.
[151:35.82]Thank you so much, everybody.
[151:36.88]A couple of you guys dropped lots of cash, like Edgemont, Ben, of course.
[151:45.99]Like hundreds of dollars.
[151:47.03]So you guys are... You guys spoil me like a spoiled, rotten little child.
[151:56.98]Good night.
[151:58.26]The next stream, the next stream is not going to be on Tuesday.
[152:01.30]It will probably be on Wednesday.
[152:03.38]So one week from right now on Wednesday is the next actual live stream because I'm not going to be around on Tuesday because I think that's going to be like a travel day.
[152:15.35]I might try to do something at TwitchCon and whether that's stream from like one of the random booths
[152:24.68]Or do an IRL stream over the weekend?
[152:27.04]I have no idea.
[152:29.27]But I really don't want to go a full week without streaming, because... I don't know, I like it.
[152:34.15]So... I might try to do something like that for at least like 30 or 40 minutes over the weekend.
[152:41.92]We'll see.
[152:45.38]Paying $100 next stream to be called pretty.
[152:50.10]well look everybody you're all beautiful all of you guys let me I'm gonna give you some real actual advice okay like this is I came I came up with this I thought about this the other day and like you like you're you're all like beautiful it doesn't matter what anybody says the world's not gonna like keep you down you know and I I'm gonna put you know I'm gonna put that on uh you know those things when you go in the bathroom
[153:17.59]And you're peeing and there's like a little thing in front of you, like a note that is on like the cupboard in front of you.
[153:24.33]Man, you are beautiful no matter what they say.
[153:32.19]I'm glad somebody caught on to that.
[153:34.92]Good night, guys.
[153:37.04]I will see you soon.
[153:44.56]Bye-bye.
[153:44.96]Also, wait a minute.
[153:45.52]Somebody mentioned this.
[153:46.06]I want to bring this up.
[153:47.84]What is going on with those things in the urinals?
[153:50.87]Alright, I'm s- I'm- we're gonna- stream's still going.
[153:54.21]Because I- we have to talk about this.
[153:57.85]What- those like- not urinal cakes.
[154:00.99]I'm not talking about- because everyone knows a urinal cake is the thing to make- the thing to make your pee smell like fruity piss.
[154:06.41]It's the way- urinal cakes make a bathroom smell like somebody...
[154:12.54]peed inside of like sherbert ice cream that I understand that purpose but those like gummy textured pee catchers what is that what that's supposed to be are you supposed to piss into those knowingly that because here's how I pee into a toilet because I'm terrified of getting somebody's piss on me somebody pisses in a urinal you walk up to the urinal and guess what like I don't want to have that guy's piss splash on me
[154:41.00]You're not supposed to touch it.
[154:41.90]I'm not talking about touching it.
[154:43.09]I'm talking about pissing into it.
[154:48.07]What am I talking about?
[154:48.81]Next time you go to the bathroom, look at like the jello jelly pee catcher that's at the bottom.
[154:53.57]It's not on all of them.
[154:54.31]It's on some of them.
[155:01.33]Putting too much thought into this.
[155:03.41]No, it's important, because should I pee directly into that?
[155:06.56]Is that actually... Should I put... Should I put my... My faith in the fact that if I piss right into that, it's not going to splash on me?
[155:15.80]I never do.
[155:16.20]It's like a net.
[155:19.42]It's a pee net.
[155:28.05]The stream over gif has looped three times.
[155:32.40]to keep the bleach off should I put it in my face oh and and another thing and another thing what we got another thing to talk about
[156:11.60]Watch out for that Bitcoin hard fork coming up in November here.
[156:31.61]It already happened?
[156:32.45]Wait, what do you mean it already happened?
[156:34.90]Did it?
[156:36.04]I don't even like have like any fucking Bitcoin.
[156:40.36]It's really interesting, though.
[156:42.20]I've been doing a lot of reading.
[156:43.74]I've been reading a shitload about, like, the Bitcoin and Ethereum and, like, Segwit.
[156:48.92]Like, there's, like, Segwit2x.
[156:50.30]Like, shit's going cra- It's, like, crazy.
[156:51.68]It's, like, it's a- It's, like, it's, like, fucking Marvel and DC Civil War.
[156:55.91]It's fascinating stuff.
