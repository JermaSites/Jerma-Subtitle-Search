[00:00.03]My face can't even be plugged in.
[00:01.99]Well, probably not.
[00:03.03]No, there it is.
[00:13.26]Hi.
[00:15.22]Yeah, the hair's getting a little wacky.
[00:17.36]I've got to get it cut.
[00:19.02]It's true.
[00:20.58]It's getting to that point like it was before.
[00:22.14]Not quite yet there.
[00:24.82]It's not quite there.
[00:26.83]But it's getting there.
[00:40.52]So what do you guys want to, what do you want to talk about?
[00:44.64]Oh my God.
[00:46.74]No.
[00:47.04]Did somebody seriously just give me over $250 fucking dollars right now?
[00:52.39]I didn't do anything.
[00:58.03]Thank you so much for that, for 200.
[01:00.61]Thank you so much for like a week's paycheck.
[01:04.39]Thank you.
[01:10.13]Thank you, Lukewarm Soda Can, for the $250.
[01:18.07]Much love to you.
[01:19.71]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your content since I was 13.
[01:21.41]I'm now getting ready for my undergraduate studies.
[01:26.31]Thank you so much for all the content you've created over the last five years.
[01:28.73]It's done more than I can express in mere words.
[01:30.59]P.S.
[01:32.00]Fuck a Comcast.
[01:33.56]We'll watch you pretty much regardless of what happens.
[01:37.30]Thank you so much, Lukewarm Soda Can.
[01:42.75]I that's a lot of money and
[01:46.66]If you can't express into words how much the content has done, I can't express into words for how insane I think it is that people willing to give me $250 and just drop it in this chat.
[02:02.49]It shocks me every day.
[02:04.53]I hope it's worth it.
[02:05.77]I hope you think it's worth it because that's what I want to try to do.
[02:10.05]Thank you so much, dude.
[02:12.13]I'm forever grateful.
[02:14.73]Thank you.
[02:19.71]Mod him.
[02:21.49]No, nobody just gets... I got big hands.
[02:23.75]Did I tell you that?
[02:24.97]You see how big my hands are?
[02:27.11]Look at next to my face how big my hands are.
[02:29.35]Look at that.
[02:31.49]Look at how big these are.
[02:32.79]They're right next to my head.
[02:33.61]Look at how huge my fucking hands are.
[02:36.00]You see that?
[02:43.56]You know what they say about big hands?
[02:46.06]Yeah.
[02:47.20]Perfect strangulation power.
[02:54.03]Well, Booger almost just shot out of my nose and that would have been on a fucking failure website.
[02:58.67]Streamer shoots Booger out of his nose into his own mouth and throws it back up into his nose on stream.
[03:17.70]Do you ever think that today you're going to watch a guy have like an internet problem and just have like a camera on him?
[03:23.35]Like, that's what's going on right now.
[03:25.31]Like, right now, you guys are watching a guy looking at a Dark Souls game, having internet problems, and just going like this.
[03:37.93]Shit.
[03:40.39]Look at, like, what kind of fucking world?
[03:42.47]What a crazy amount of technology we have.
[03:45.11]The power through this whole... What a crazy fucking world.
[03:48.47]You can watch me in real time
[03:52.80]be upset at my computer and I'm in the screen and you can watch me watching my screen being upset at my screen.
[04:04.52]Who made this?
[04:06.45]If you think that aliens don't exist, oh boy, I got some news for you.
[04:10.93]They do.
[04:11.27]Where do you think we got this power from?
[04:17.49]Holy shit.
[04:21.60]Delay?
[04:22.66]No, not on like the Twitch beta.
[04:25.21]There's no delay on the Twitch beta.
[04:27.83]It's like two seconds.
[04:31.87]He's losing it.
[04:34.91]Ugh.
[04:44.01]I honestly like it.
[04:46.17]Oh my god.
[04:46.87]I just wanted to play Dark Souls.
[04:47.93]I'm having such a good time in this game.
[04:51.56]I'm having such a great time in Dark Souls, and I'm having a great time experiencing it with everybody, and it's been a lot of fucking fun.
[04:57.52]It's been so much fun.
[05:00.53]Let me have it, Dad.
[05:01.97]Let me have fun, Dad.
[05:03.23]I just want to go out with my friends, Dad.
[05:04.87]I don't need a 10 o'clock curfew, Dad.
[05:06.69]At least 1130, Dad.
[05:19.25]It's like I can't, like I'm grabbing this.
[05:21.69]My hand is so big.
[05:22.91]This is an extra large coffee.
[05:25.69]Look at this.
[05:27.79]This is next to my head.
[05:30.99]You see how big this is?
[05:33.69]See, look at just for scale.
[05:44.92]Is Windows Update still downloading in the background?
[05:46.96]I don't know.
[05:48.93]I'm going to take a sledgehammer to this computer in like fucking five minutes.
[05:54.15]Small head.
[05:57.33]I don't think I have a small head, man.
[05:59.19]Have you seen how big my head is compared to my hand?
[06:01.82]Look at that.
[06:03.46]It's so much bigger.
[06:05.92]If anything, I have trouble buying hats because they're too, I need like an extra, extra large.
[06:11.74]This is my hand next to my head directly next to it.
[06:14.91]It's, I feel like a baby.
[06:36.81]Reduce head size.
[06:39.85]Oh, but honestly, like just to go back that thank lukewarm again.
[06:43.29]Thank you for the 250 fucking dollars.
[06:44.91]That's so much money.
[06:46.45]You got I've you guys have given me like $400 for a stream that doesn't even work.
[06:53.16]So you're thanking me.
[06:55.94]No, no, no, no.
[06:57.34]Like, yeah, let me thank you for doing that because I just made $450 or so.
[07:06.08]By looking at a screen with my screen with my computer breaking and my internet failing.
[07:11.94]Thank you for that.
[07:12.98]Like, seriously.
[07:20.03]Jeremiah, can I leave the stream?
[07:21.85]Yes.
[07:22.39]Yes, you can.
[07:23.11]You are absolutely allowed to leave the stream.
[07:28.95]I don't have to give you permission to do that.
[07:30.47]You can go whenever you want.
[07:31.76]You don't have to ask permission.
[07:37.69]Humble brag, greedy streamer.
[07:42.90]I don't think that... I don't know.
[07:44.78]No, I don't think so.
[07:48.06]That money's to buy a lawyer to sue Comcast.
[07:54.66]We're free.
[07:56.17]Yeah, you guys can go.
[07:57.21]Go on.
[07:57.57]You can get out of here if you want.
[08:00.37]You can stay if you want to.
[08:02.93]I know this is not the stream that everybody wanted and it's not the stream that I wanted either.
[08:15.79]We were making progress too.
[08:17.05]We were having fun.
[08:19.43]Last night, we made a lot of fun progress.
[08:21.73]This is just moving on to the more fun things.
[08:24.21]I just want to do them.
[08:32.59]By the way, just for if anyone's curious, the money stream with no content.
[08:39.90]I don't want to do that.
[08:41.24]That's my point.
[08:42.08]I don't want that.
[08:44.82]I don't want there to be a ticker on the screen here with like everybody that's given a bunch of money while I go like this.
[08:56.72]Like, I should, you know, I should make a ticker right now and literally just watch it go with the bits.
[09:03.30]You know, just sit there and like, it goes from left to right here, right?
[09:07.49]Imagine if I was just sitting there going like this, like, oh, somebody gave money.
[09:18.58]Like, I don't want to do that.
[09:32.30]Only $3.99.
[09:33.16]I could only crack my neck.
[09:35.92]I got a fucked up neck.
[09:37.06]I got a fucked up back.
[09:38.16]I got a fucked up chest.
[09:41.20]Now that, look, da-ding!
[09:47.59]Can you just go like, can you just do that without the money ticker?
[09:50.11]No, but it has to go like across the screen and very slowly.
[09:54.17]I need to watch it the whole time.
[10:00.96]Don't crack my neck.
[10:04.68]I'm afraid to crack my neck.
[10:05.84]Did I tell you that ever?
[10:07.26]I don't like going too far.
[10:09.04]I go like this far and it's like a little and a little but I see these videos, man.
[10:17.17]Of the chiropractors doing the solid snake break your neck.
[10:22.03]I will never do that.
[10:23.06]Ever.
[10:25.08]I just keep thinking of in Metal Gear Solid.
[10:28.34]That chiropractor gets around and it just goes that like.
[10:34.30]No.
[10:39.97]That's going to happen to me.
[10:40.65]I feel like that's exactly what will happen to me.
[10:47.76]Can I do a workout stream?
[10:48.76]Sure.
[10:48.98]I don't have any... Fuck yeah.
[10:57.87]I got no props.
[10:58.87]Where's my prop bag?
[11:00.13]I don't have any props in here.
[11:01.21]I got a TV over here.
[11:04.03]I can lift that again.
[11:13.82]Chiropractors are not real doctors.
[11:16.06]Alright, let's just do the thing where I just read fucking bits on stream and hang out.
[11:20.90]I gotta change to... I don't want to change to IRL.
[11:28.51]I hate changing to IRL.
[11:30.39]I need to be doing something else besides that.
[11:39.05]anything like should I do like some calligraphy while I do this so I can at least say like hey like hanging out with chat and doing calligraphy now I don't want to play geoguessr right now it's my brain is just I'm
[12:05.82]There's a fucking fight in here right now.
[12:08.78]My brain, one hemisphere, the intelligent hemisphere, the hemisphere that can do all the math and knows how to build railroad tracks and shit, that one right now is saying, Jeremy, you should probably just leave.
[12:20.79]Just end the stream and say thank you and move on.
[12:24.31]Work on some of the other things that you might want to do for a future stream and get on that railroad and start building it and get the materials down, lay it down and build it because it needs repair.
[12:35.44]The other side, the left hemisphere of my brain, the one that's the creative one, the one that can paint, the one that can guess your weight at the carnival when you step on the scale, and the guy goes, you're 191.
[12:49.27]And you get on, and you're like, holy shit, he's right.
[12:51.95]That part of my brain is saying, no, keep it going.
[12:55.29]And try to do something cool now.
[12:57.03]Try to do something fun on the fly.
[12:58.77]And they're having a fight in there.
[12:59.78]They both have armies.
[13:02.08]The right side has like a computer, like computer lasers and the left side has like fucking paintbrushes like Super Mario Paint Shine.
[13:16.43]And then the anger portion of my brain just like drops the nuke on all of them.
[13:21.89]There's only one guy on that team.
[13:25.16]It's the Medulla Oblongata back here.
[13:28.05]And he just like, presses the nuke button and my everything, it's all gone.
[13:42.92]He's going.
[13:49.20]I can't believe you were on Critical's podcast.
[13:52.90]Why?
[13:53.16]I mean, that was, a lot of people were talking about that for like a year.
[13:57.71]I eventually just, you know, hit him up and we did it and it was fun.
[14:02.50]Going hollow.
[14:03.76]I told you.
[14:07.86]Like, I'm starting to understand.
[14:12.50]Like... No, I'm not going to say it.
[14:15.88]That's so stupid.
[14:21.70]He's finally lost it.
[14:22.67]I didn't find... If I finally lost it...
[14:26.43]How long have you been here for?
[14:29.55]It's been gone a long time.
[14:32.15]It's been gone at least like three or four years.
[14:36.10]Oh wow, man.
[14:37.40]He's finally lost it.
[14:39.10]Finally.
[14:41.66]Not like a year ago when he did a bunch of children's magic shows.
[14:45.82]He's finally lost it now.
[14:47.96]This is the point now when he's lost it.
[14:53.04]You know, it's like, God damn, now he's fucking, he's gone crazy.
[14:57.18]He's gone crazy.
[15:02.70]The stream seems good now.
[15:03.92]I'll hang out for as long as it fucking takes.
[15:06.91]I don't even care.
[15:08.83]You guys want to just hang out until I can play Dark Souls for like a couple hours?
[15:12.69]If it ever, it might not even happen.
[15:13.89]I might be here till four in the morning.
[15:16.11]This is, this is my protest on, I'm going to, Comcast protest.
[15:21.79]Right now I have like a fucking sign that says like, give me back my internet.
[15:27.24]This is a protest.
[15:28.52]I'm not going to eat.
[15:29.68]I'm not going to drink.
[15:30.82]I'm not going to sleep.
[15:32.28]Protest.
[15:38.33]After that now, like after that one starts.
[15:48.39]Okay, now it starts.
[15:49.13]I just want to make sure I had enough fluids to last like an hour.
[15:52.73]Okay, here we go.
[15:53.59]I need a protest sign.
[16:06.79]I want to make a sign.
[16:12.68]I can't make a sign.
[16:13.32]I don't have anything.
[16:13.84]All I have is like a bug collector over here.
[16:16.86]That's correct.
[16:17.38]I have a bug collector.
[16:18.84]You think I'm a liar?
[16:19.52]Oh, he's lying.
[16:21.81]What is he talking about?
[16:23.55]Here.
[16:24.81]I got one of these.
[16:25.85]This is a bug collector.
[16:29.30]Let me show you how it works.
[16:31.78]So right here, because obviously I'm down in a basement, right?
[16:36.70]And there are some fucked up bugs that try to kill me down here, right?
[16:43.03]You've seen a few of them.
[16:44.43]A bug collector, you sit it here and it collects bugs.
[16:48.03]And then you can sell them.
[16:50.28]You can get at least $4 or $5 per housefly.
[16:55.16]It's a weird, weird, like, black market for this thing.
[16:58.58]I don't know why it exists.
[17:00.53]They've got to be alive.
[17:01.19]They've got to be in a jar.
[17:02.65]And it actually, there's a little LED that pops up and shows you what the estimated balance of the bugs in here are.
[17:08.57]It's really cool.
[17:12.86]Yes, a homeless guy in Boston sold this to me.
[17:15.30]So that's how you know that what he was saying was real and legit.
[17:20.17]And he was, by the way, he was very uncomfortably close to my face talking about it.
[17:24.01]Really close.
[17:24.93]That's how I could trust him even more, you know?
[17:37.00]Animal Crossing.
[17:39.38]Somebody gets it.
[17:49.20]No, he's lost it.
[17:50.76]Oh, this guy's fucking lost it.
[17:53.36]I gotta change the title.
[17:54.50]I gotta change it to not Dark Star.
[17:56.32]I gotta... Dark Souls.
[17:58.01]Hold on.
[18:07.25]I liked the Dark... I'm holding on to that title.
[18:09.65]The Dark Souls title.
[18:10.43]I'm doing that again.
[18:11.09]I get to do that again.
[18:11.80]It didn't come.
[18:21.06]Yeah, protesting my internet.
[18:25.04]There you go.
[18:34.28]Give me back my internet.
[18:37.94]Let's at least get... I got an idea.
[18:42.05]I can make a sign here.
[18:44.27]This will take a second or two, but it'll be worth it.
[18:46.73]Hold on.
[18:50.37]I'm going to make a sign.
[18:53.82]So, let's see.
[18:54.36]If I hold it like this, I'll get it.
[19:00.60]So, let's do a painting here.
[19:02.46]You guys will see the finished product in a second.
[19:05.84]Maybe like a minute or two.
[19:06.66]But, you know, what else are we doing?
[19:09.03]You know?
[19:09.83]What the fuck else are we doing right now?
[19:12.91]How do you make a transparent background in paint?
[19:15.57]Can you?
[19:16.83]Probably not.
[19:17.31]Whatever.
[19:24.15]My arm is way too big.
[19:25.22]Hold on.
[19:32.16]This is my elbow.
[19:35.08]And then here's the sign.
[19:36.16]Okay.
[19:44.80]That looks good.
[19:53.00]Alright, now I just gotta say, I gotta write, gimme back my internet on it.
[19:59.13]Let's do gimme back my internet.
[20:17.43]Internet, okay.
[20:20.55]Alright, let's get this on the screen.
[20:23.81]Save this as just a PNG right on the desktop.
[20:29.41]Okay, so let's add that.
[20:40.22]There it is, okay.
[20:48.44]So if I go
[20:55.61]Like that, right?
[21:07.59]Oh shit, hold on.
[21:15.30]See, now you got like a... And my arm's a little too long, but it's alright though.
[21:21.68]I gotta get, how do I like, I gotta erase this part.
[21:29.30]That's very realistic.
[21:30.32]Well, that's all I can do.
[21:32.96]I couldn't do a transparent background.
[21:41.10]I got a leg over here.
[21:43.28]Hold on.
[21:47.78]Give me back my fucking internet!
[21:51.80]I got two elbows now.
[21:58.22]You understand?

[21:59.48]I need to stream Dark Souls.
[22:05.69]New emote.
[22:08.13]No, I just, I cooked this thing up for five seconds.
[22:10.13]Here, let's stay up there.
[22:23.80]No, it's gotta be this hand, always.
[22:30.71]should make another hand coming up here and like grabbing it with this hand too I gotta get transparency though hold on let me like keep that on the screen I'm gonna actually get like a transparent background let's do it with photoshop so let's bring this into photoshop and get rid of the background and add some things to it okay photoshop

[22:59.35]Not Microsoft photos.
[23:02.27]I think we're gone.
[23:02.73]Am I live?
[23:08.09]I don't even know if I'm still live.
[23:09.45]I just saw it go to zero.
[23:14.90]This is going to be fucking awful, but whatever.
[23:16.92]Here we go.
[23:20.04]Custom.
[23:20.72]That's fine.

[23:55.23]Okay.
[23:58.26]I hope you guys are ready for this.
[24:06.12]Because I'm never gonna do this again, just in case everyone's wondering.
[24:08.90]Okay, let's do the magic, that magic stick there.
[24:16.53]And let's delete the, oh, I think I just broke, my computer's crashing.
[24:23.73]What, I don't know what I just did!
[24:26.54]Wait, how did this, how did this happen?
[24:30.66]I didn't do this.
[24:32.30]This is like some weird shit scribbled on the wall.
[24:34.80]I tried to delete the background and I came up with this.
[24:43.25]What the fuck?
[24:45.55]You have to see this.

[50:25.54]I think I'm going to be like, what are you talking about?
[50:28.74]Get to work.
[50:32.06]Okay, so English time.
[50:39.88]Am I going to get like littered with ads right now?
[50:43.42]I hope not.
[50:45.50]Let me capture this so you can see what the fuck I'm doing.
[50:47.28]Okay, add window capture.
[50:55.21]There it is.
[50:57.65]Just need to make sure I can see it.
[51:03.59]There it is.
[51:03.99]Okay.
[51:08.01]So here's Kahoot.
[51:08.87]Kahoot.
[51:15.81]OK.
[51:18.99]So I should probably make this bigger and then make me smaller.
[51:27.47]That would make the most sense, I think.
[51:40.94]OK.
[51:42.66]Hi.
[51:45.47]Now what?
[51:46.81]English.
[51:47.23]English grammar.

[52:26.85]Play.
[52:30.00]Here we go.
[52:30.42]This takes this long to load this?
[52:39.20]Is it gonna be loud?
[52:40.20]Is there a lot of sounds in this game?
[52:46.16]Team?
[52:46.84]Team mode.
[52:49.64]Player versus player.
[52:56.99]Ready to join.
[52:57.69]Join at Kahoot and enter the game pin.

[53:05.48]Are you guys supposed to have that info?
[53:07.98]Well, now you got my password.
[53:09.18]You got my pin number.
[53:18.06]I guess there it is.
[53:21.88]We got one player.
[53:24.16]Naughty nicknames beware.
[53:25.72]One click on your name and you're out.
[53:30.07]This can't handle like... Can this handle PUBG amount of players?
[53:34.13]Oh my fucking god.
[53:36.37]I don't know if I should have done this.
[53:37.61]I don't like this.
[53:41.72]There's too many people.
[53:42.52]It's not gonna be... This is for like Joan and David at the office.
[53:46.13]This is not designed for like 400 people.
[54:08.51]We're gonna crash Kahoot.
[54:10.19]We're gonna ruin everybody's day.
[54:11.61]Because you guys wanted to crash Kahoot.
[54:13.07]Oh my fucking god.
[54:14.17]There's too many people.
[54:15.33]Too many people.
[54:15.85]We're doing like a 1v1.
[54:19.69]This 1v1.
[54:20.71]We're not supposed to bring like a thousand people into this server.
[54:25.00]Alright, I'm starting.
[54:25.90]I'm clicking the button.
[54:26.94]I'm freaking out right now.
[54:27.70]I'm scared.
[54:30.26]Let's go.
[54:32.54]24 questions.
[54:32.90]Are you ready?
[54:33.74]English verbs.
[54:34.30]I don't know what I'm ready for.
[54:35.94]What is he doing?
[54:39.13]Who, what?
[54:39.89]Oh, that was fun.
[55:16.01]I didn't even get a chance to answer.
[55:21.24]What?
[55:24.46]What happened?
[55:26.65]No, what?
[55:27.13]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:28.13]Oh, I gotta go.
[55:28.69]I gotta go fast because it's gonna... She's jumping.

[55:50.87]Why would you fucking select painting?
[56:00.16]What, I wasn't fast enough?
[56:03.88]What is he doing?
[56:08.35]He's reading!
[56:09.81]Wait, I'm the host?
[56:11.83]I don't get to answer?
[56:17.85]Alright, I've had enough of that.
[56:29.48]I'm fucking spectating.
[56:31.23]I thought you guys wanted me to play this.
[56:32.75]This is just for you to play this game on my stream?
[56:41.96]Hey, congratulations.
[56:43.04]I love Jerma.
[56:43.84]What is he doing?
[56:45.12]There's 24 questions.
[56:46.06]I'm exiting out of this window in about 10 seconds.
[56:50.32]Now it's a speedrun.
[56:51.75]Good luck.
[56:53.65]Go on.
[56:53.89]Come on.
[56:54.65]Come on.
[56:54.93]You want to make it hard?
[56:56.91]What is he doing?
[56:58.29]He's driving a car.

[57:06.95]He's eating.
[57:10.38]Good.
[57:10.82]Keep going.
[57:18.58]Oh, there's a delay.
[57:28.59]Coughing.
[57:35.94]I can't fucking believe this is what I'm doing right now.
[57:39.58]Why are there 24 questions?
[57:49.37]What the fuck?
[57:52.96]Somebody got it.
[57:53.52]Somebody got reading.
[57:54.54]I can't fucking handle this, man.
[57:57.86]I hate this.
[58:11.71]I fucking hate this.
[58:13.57]I don't want to do this anymore.
[58:14.85]I'm done.
[58:15.32]I'm done.

[59:13.46]How the fuck do you have 12,000 points?
[59:16.20]You fucking hacker.
[59:18.10]You're a hacker.
[59:25.97]There's no fucking way.
[59:26.83]That's impossible.
[59:28.03]That is physically impossible.
[59:35.31]Oh boy, we're lagging.
[59:39.44]Last one.

[59:53.48]I think people just gave up.
[59:54.84]They're like, he's not going to let us gas mine his phone.
[60:18.19]Congratulations.
[60:20.34]You did it.
[60:25.53]Stop popping popcorn.
[60:26.69]Alright.
[60:28.29]I clicked out the window.
[60:29.39]I deleted it.
[60:33.56]I'm gone.
[60:35.16]It's gone.
[60:42.06]I fucking swear.
[60:50.25]We weren't supposed to do it like that.
[60:55.39]Un-fucking-believable.
[61:01.54]Frames back, no.
[61:04.72]I'm going to call it.
[61:08.12]We're going to read the bits.
[61:08.86]We'll do the subscriptions.
[61:10.92]It's just not coming back.
[61:14.42]Well, thanks for having fun regardless.
[61:16.31]Thanks for making it a fun stream.
[61:19.90]I was really hoping that we could wait.
[61:22.04]After two fucking hours, we wouldn't be back, but it's not.
[61:29.26]So, here's what's going to happen.
[61:31.77]Tomorrow, I'm going to try to stream tomorrow.
[61:40.37]Tomorrow, Thursday, I'm going to start early tomorrow or try to.
[61:45.34]I don't know what time, but expect us to try again tomorrow.
[61:56.48]Thanks for sticking around if you've taken off.
[62:00.37]Thanks for hanging out regardless.
[62:07.23]No, I mean, I want to play Dark Souls.
[62:10.31]I want to play the fucking game Dark Souls.
[62:12.31]I don't want to just like, yeah, you know, don't feel like playing it today.
[62:16.54]I am currently addicted to Dark Souls Remastered, so I want to play it.
[62:20.72]I don't want to just not play it.
[62:22.83]And I don't want to play it off-stream because I don't want to... I've never played this part.
[62:27.76]It's blind from here on out, so why wouldn't I want to share a blind playthrough?
[62:32.40]I'm not going to, like, go play through Sen's Fortress on another character and be like, ooh, that one part where I get hit by the boulder.
[62:37.98]Oh, ow, it got me.
[62:40.38]I didn't see that coming.
[62:41.32]I don't want to be one of those.
[62:43.55]I'm not going to... Be careful here.
[62:46.15]Oh, a podcast.
[62:48.06]The, uh, hey, got ya.
[62:51.00]That's right.
[62:51.74]Now you're in trouble.
[62:52.46]No, the podcast should be on Charlie's channel.
[62:58.01]The official podcast I'm talking about.
[62:59.31]I think either tonight or tomorrow.
[63:05.05]Tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow night, I think, is when it officially launches.
[63:09.07]If you're a Patreon supporter, I guess you get it early.
[63:11.32]I don't know.
[63:13.52]But it's coming out probably tomorrow.
[63:19.47]Thanks for sticking around.
[63:20.11]Thanks for watching.
[63:21.09]Let's do the credits and the bits.
[63:24.83]And again, I apologize for... Apparently, squirrels eat my internet lines four times a week.
[63:35.14]And they won't fix it.
[63:35.98]They refuse to.
[63:38.10]They've apparently fixed it.
[63:40.30]Fixed it.
[63:41.56]Like 15 fucking times.
[63:45.81]But, take care.
[63:46.85]If you're taking off now, let's do the...
[63:49.77]Let's do the credits.
[63:52.98]Try again tomorrow.
[63:55.02]See you soon.
[63:59.14]Why did I just blink like seven times?
[64:00.72]I don't know.
[64:06.04]Uh, where is, where is the, where the fuck?
[64:09.03]Okay, there we go.

[67:51.28]Didn't go to the wiki.
[67:52.58]Didn't see what he did.
[67:53.72]Didn't find out what his vulnerabilities were.
[67:56.51]First try, blind.
[67:57.89]Flamelurker didn't even blink.
[67:59.95]He didn't even hurt me.
[68:03.29]Thank you.
[68:05.57]uh prime vino thanks for the five bucks dying internet plus windows update eve equals Jerma literally exploding yeah it remember we we talked about last night man how like this really really pisses me off
[68:29.39]Once I can finally just have no bullshit to have to worry about every day with these streams.
[68:38.14]It takes so much focus off of what I want to do, when 30% of the time I'm worried if the stream will even work.
[68:46.71]It just fucking puts a damper on everything.
[68:54.07]You thought I was streaming till 4?
[68:55.69]You liar.
[68:56.39]Well, the internet doesn't work.
[68:57.41]I'm at zero right now.
[69:01.53]Hopefully you can even hear what I'm saying.
[69:05.99]Hey, Etalyx, thanks for the host, Etalyx, as I end my stream after not even two hours.
[69:12.97]The internet in Nevada... Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada is shit as well.

[70:10.49]Thank you so much, dude.
[70:13.13]For your 50 dollars.
[70:16.74]Hey Jeremy, just want to tell you that watching your Dark Souls playthrough has made me laugh so hard my stomach hurts.
[70:21.44]That tree section was genuinely perfect.
[70:23.98]Please continue to play how you want to because it's innocent, hilarious, and produces amazing entertainment.
[70:28.95]If you played how the chat wants, it would be far less entertaining.
[70:31.39]Lots of love.
[70:33.63]Thank you, Debunk, for your incredibly encouraging, nice words and your large amount of money that you just gave.
[70:42.87]Thank you, man.
[70:44.90]Yeah, I mean, I love this series.
[70:46.76]I love all these games.
[70:50.25]The FromSoftware games are some of my favorite things to stream and favorite things to play, especially when I don't know what's happening.
[70:57.99]There's something about, and look, I'm this way too.
[71:00.25]When somebody has never played, for instance, like Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3 or Dark Souls 2, watching someone play it for the first time is so much fun.
[71:11.11]I love just watching somebody do that because there are so many amazing experiences in these games.
[71:17.52]I want to continue to have them.
[71:19.34]So hopefully you're enjoying it.
[71:22.78]Thank you for your large donation here.
[71:26.72]So let's go back down here.
[71:29.75]We were at... Last one we did was CoolCat for $2, who said, Anyway, thanks for making my shitty day a little better.
[71:39.71]Thank you again.

[72:09.81]Keep your head up, man.
[72:10.43]Hopefully you feel better.
[72:16.84]V Muser, thanks for the $1.
[72:18.40]Casey, thanks for the $4. $4.
[72:21.46]Hey, Jerma, it's my birthday tomorrow.
[72:22.92]I just want to say to you and Kim, all of chat are invited to my birthday bash as well.
[72:30.13]There's going to be cake, clowns, and a bouncy castle.

[72:44.26]I'm going to wear my shoes.
[72:45.82]I'm going to wear my cleats in the bouncy house.
[72:50.66]I'm gonna be the guy that puts, like, the hole in it.
[72:52.80]And the whole thing starts to... And come down on everybody, and everyone's like, What the fuck?
[72:59.09]Get out!
[72:59.35]Get out of here!
[73:01.27]And I'm in there just laughing.
[73:07.67]And the thing just melts.
[73:10.47]And then I leave.
[73:11.57]I sneak out the back door, and you lose your security deposit.
[73:14.81]And I'm sitting there just, like, rubbing my hands together, like, Yes!
[73:17.92]Yes!
[73:18.26]Yes!
[73:25.01]What an asshole.
[73:32.56]Evil.

[74:15.47]Thank you, Sly161.
[74:16.53]For the $1.50.
[74:19.35]Hey Jerm, just wanted you to know the game God Hand was part of your PS2 pile.
[74:23.42]I'm going through it now and it's pretty fun.
[74:24.90]I'd love to see you do at least 30 minutes on it.
[74:28.62]Also, Mod Comcast.
[74:33.76]No, I already told you.
[74:34.46]I want Comcast to just run out of town by somebody that has a better service.
[74:44.14]The first person that comes in and just goes, hey, I have like a better idea for like an internet thing and we're going to put it in your area.
[74:49.63]I hope like the Wicked Witch of the West just gets pushed out of all these areas.
[74:55.82]Too big, too much power, too much infrastructure that they can just, it doesn't matter.
[75:00.76]Like nothing matters to them.
[75:09.90]never gonna happen but you know some one can hope that there'll be competition enough competition where they don't have a monopoly in like the entire area but thank you uh thank you also to
[75:32.24]uh yeah but I I still have God Hand so I could pull it out of the the rafters there for another um ps2 stream thank you though thank you tingy for the one dollar you don't need to apologize to us like you said this is not your fault you're honestly the most dedicated streamer I've ever seen on the site you care about your experience you care about our experience and that in itself shows how great you are
[75:58.59]I've only been here for six months, but I can wholeheartedly say that you're by far my favorite streamer.
[76:01.75]Thank you for everything you do and for the amazing content.
[76:07.00]That is a whole bunch of nice things for me to hear.
[76:11.06]And I hope that you guys really do like this stuff.
[76:18.46]I hope so.
[76:21.18]I want you guys to have fun.
[76:25.25]And we don't get to have fun when shit like this happens.
[76:33.15]But thank you for even remotely mentioning that you have a great experience here and I'm your favorite streamer.
[76:38.98]Like, hearing that is just... I can do more and I want to do more.
[76:45.34]I'm gonna try harder.
[76:47.24]Like, hearing shit like this makes me want to go another step.
[76:52.46]You understand?
[76:57.71]Because there's so much more to do.
[76:59.23]There's so much more shit to do.
[77:04.80]Thank you for saying that.
[77:08.28]Thank you GK9999 for the $1.
[77:11.06]Not gonna lie, if I had the money, I'd give more than these small $1 donations.
[77:15.63]Donating to your stream was literally the reason I ever bought bits in the first place.
[77:22.63]Don't worry about that.
[77:24.49]If you want to give me a dollar, give me a dollar.
[77:27.51]If you want to give me zero dollars, don't give anything.
[77:30.19]And just hang up.
[77:32.41]There's no price to pay.
[77:34.23]There's no entry point that you have to do where you are allowed to sit here and watch the stream.
[77:42.99]So, from a dollar to a thousand dollars, there's no... You don't have to worry about that.
[77:55.03]Thank you.
[77:57.03]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[77:58.09]Did you try turning it off and turning it on again?
[78:00.65]No, I didn't actually.
[78:02.25]Shit.
[78:06.65]I did not turn it off and turn it on again.
[78:08.10]Fuck.
[78:12.00]What if it worked?
[78:13.18]God.
[78:15.72]But thank you, Smelly boy.
[78:16.88]Thank you, Max Man Manus for the $5.
[78:18.84]They say cheer 105 times and appreciate you.
[78:26.05]Thank you.
[78:27.89]I appreciate you too.
[78:32.96]Much love, dude.
[78:33.46]Thanks a lot.
[78:35.24]Garfield, the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[78:38.14]Here is a screen grab.
[78:40.42]Get ready for a new age in Garfagraph messages, Jerma.
[78:42.74]We just upped the budget.
[78:46.54]Let's take a look.
[78:49.58]Here we go.
[78:51.28]Here is the image in question.
[78:56.08]Wow, this Jerma guy sure is funny.
[78:58.50]I should send him some funny bit messages.
[79:00.20]Garfagraphs.
[79:01.74]I can't believe he reads this garbage.
[79:04.22]I know, right?
[79:04.72]I sent like a hundred bit messages at this point for 25 cents a pop.
[79:18.28]Have you just been garfing me this whole time?
[79:26.75]It's all good.
[79:29.95]Thank you, YaBoy15.
[79:31.05]Did I miss this earlier?
[79:33.33]I hope not.
[79:36.64]Did I miss this $50 donation earlier?
[79:39.28]Fuck, I think I did.
[79:42.42]Thank you so much, man.
[79:44.18]I must have somehow not heard this or seen this.
[79:47.82]If you're still here, thank you so much, YaBoy15.
[79:50.17]Thank you.
[79:55.02]Much love to you.
[79:55.56]And they say, fuck Comcast.
[80:00.02]Yeah, I wouldn't be as salty in quotes and as annoyed and mad about this if it didn't keep happening.
[80:10.25]It just keeps happening.
[80:13.05]And at some point, man, I wonder how much money it costs them.
[80:19.30]to, number one, think about all the people that they're paying on the tech support lines, right?
[80:23.89]So you've got salaries across the board for people that are going out to these houses and diagnosing and putting through fixes and problems to the internet, right?
[80:36.74]I've probably costed Comcast a bunch of money to have
[80:43.70]Like, seven different technicians come out here more than a dozen fucking times over the last year.
[80:51.80]At some point, you gotta fix the problem.
[80:56.56]You're just throwing a bunch of money into a trash can.
[81:00.49]If you just fix the issue, you wouldn't have to dump a bunch of more money into techs coming out to people's houses.
[81:10.67]I just never understand it.
[81:13.84]Oh, what is that?
[81:14.28]Okay, so it's like $700 to send a technician out and, like, fix something.
[81:19.41]Do it.
[81:21.19]$700 again.
[81:22.15]Yeah, the same problem.
[81:23.21]Do it $700 again.
[81:24.39]$700 again.
[81:27.17]Get the crew out there to fix the line.
[81:28.39]That whole thing's gonna cost $700 again.
[81:31.63]I wonder how much it would cost to just replace the fucking infrastructure there.
[81:36.43]Imagine if it was like less than $100,000 to fix the infrastructure and like the million dollars that they've spent on this, you know, five mile radius.
[81:45.46]I don't know, I'm pulling numbers out of my ass, but seriously.
[81:49.88]Why wouldn't you just fix the problem so it doesn't happen anymore?
[81:53.65]Rather than just put band-aids over and over again, expensive fucking band-aids.
[81:58.37]And they fall off every time.
[82:02.38]If you could go to the doctor, and you had a big cut on your arm, like a huge wound is on your arm, and the doctor puts a gigantic band-aid patch on, then he tells you, oh, by the way, Jeremy, that's going to fall off, and your cut's going to reopen in a week.
[82:18.13]Oh, but we also have this thing that I give you a shot, and in one day, the whole thing heals like Wolverine.
[82:27.36]Okay, how much is it for me to put the bandage on every four or five days?
[82:31.66]Well, it's $400.
[82:32.78]Okay.
[82:35.01]How much is the shot?
[82:36.93]It's $2,200.
[82:37.49]Give me the shot, Doc.
[82:46.04]Yeah, exactly.
[82:47.61]Somebody just said it's because they're there to make money.
[82:51.51]You end up with this never-ending cycle of problems that have to be fixed rather than just have a situation under control.
[83:00.46]It's a never-ending sea of red lights popping up on these technicians' radars for them to go... It's just money.
[83:17.11]shots but regardless I mean I I could I've probably spent a lot of time just spitting out rant after rave after rant and rambling about this shit I don't know I I don't know and I hate to be that guy I hate to be this guy that is just like complains about these problems all the time
[83:48.98]Trust me, I don't like doing it.
[83:53.02]But there's not much I can do besides do what I'm currently doing, and that's move.
[84:00.44]Just give me the goddamn shot already.
[84:04.16]Anyways, though, thank you, you boy, for the 50 bucks.
[84:07.58]Not to derail the bits here, but thank you.
[84:10.92]Much appreciated.
[84:14.00]Sir Feline, thanks for the dollar.
[84:15.16]Alright, fuck you, shitty internet streamer.
[84:17.50]Stupid head should stick to being a tuber instead.
[84:20.88]Kappa.
[84:22.62]Though, be careful, though, because everyone, like, I always, I get people asking, like, why'd you leave YouTube?
[84:29.01]I talk about this on the podcast.
[84:30.77]I'll give you a little sneak peek, though.
[84:34.67]I talked about how my intention was never to, like, abandon my YouTube channel.
[84:41.08]I'll let it speak for itself.
[84:42.24]I already talked about it on the stream.
[84:43.74]I mean, not on the stream, on the podcast.
[84:48.18]But... Did YouTube seriously, like... What's the latest thing with the whole YouTube thing?
[84:54.88]No, no, you can't stream or make content anywhere else but here.
[84:58.88]Oh, but by the way, making content here is probably the worst option.
[85:03.70]So, I mean, we talk about that a little bit.
[85:06.86]And we talk about this kind of internet culture of companies making monumental mistakes over and over again.
[85:15.94]There's a lot of interesting stuff in that podcast, for sure.
[85:20.12]I talk about this on the podcast.
[85:22.89]Is the stream cutting out for everybody else?
[85:24.41]Yes, it is.
[85:25.17]I'm sorry.
[85:26.13]It's just the thing, you know.
[85:31.90]Thank you lukewarm soda can again for 15 more dollars after giving a hundreds Look at these bits go by I gave you $250 today, but you've easily given me years of depression killing entertainment Thank you I'm I really I really am like really sorry to hear every time somebody brings that up I
[86:00.25]It makes me feel like, fuck, man.
[86:05.15]I wish there was something I could do about it.
[86:07.64]And if this is helping, then that's great.
[86:10.22]I'm happy about that.
[86:12.04]But on top of that, also, it is very important to try to take care of yourself.
[86:20.94]You know?
[86:21.62]If you're having lots of problems, if you're really down and there's a bunch of shit going on, try to, small steps at a time, to take care of it.
[86:29.16]You'll thank yourself years later.
[86:32.12]And it can be really, really fucking hard to do, but if you need to go talk to somebody that's like a professional that can help you and get you on the right path, I highly implore that you do.
[86:43.73]Implore?
[86:44.59]Imply.
[86:45.25]Implore you, yeah.
[86:56.19]But thank you for even giving me that much money or saying that I help you.
[87:06.18]And as much as I say thanks and that I'm happy about it, I really hope that a lot of you guys that have these problems start to try to fix them.
[87:17.01]Especially if you're young, you've got time.
[87:18.31]There's plenty of time.
[87:23.59]I've been in a boat like that before.
[87:26.09]Took me like six and a half, seven years to not kind of feel like shit.
[87:32.01]Just small pieces.
[87:34.32]You got a lot of time.
[87:44.21]You just got to work at it day by day.
[87:46.17]That's all you need to do.
[87:58.04]If you're old, you have no more time.
[87:59.96]No, that's not true.
[88:04.84]If you're old, you still have opportunities to take the small steps that it takes.
[88:12.47]It takes time.
[88:14.71]You don't just snap your fingers and wake up and be like, you know what?
[88:18.32]Everything's better.
[88:19.94]That doesn't happen.
[88:25.48]Over time, with the right help and the right guidelines and the right guidance, you know, it's a full-on process that takes a long fucking time.
[88:45.91]But to move on here, if I can make you happy, that makes me happy.
[88:57.39]Play GeoGuessr.
[88:59.69]No.
[89:00.99]No, I'm taking off.
[89:02.31]The stream's dying.
[89:09.94]But, anyways, thank you, Lukemore.
[89:14.46]Also, thank you to DStroke for the $1.
[89:17.60]Wilma for the $2.
[89:19.66]Scripps3 for the $1.50.
[89:22.31]How about some point-and-click games?
[89:23.63]My suggestion is Deponia.
[89:27.26]of Deponia still stands.
[89:30.12]I will check it out.
[89:31.68]I love point-and-click adventure games.
[89:32.82]They're a lot of fun.
[89:35.20]And then D-Stroke again, two bucks.
[89:37.90]Again, two bucks.
[89:38.84]Again, two bucks.
[89:40.32]Again, two dollars from D-Stroke.
[89:43.56]No message, just a bunch of money in a row.
[89:47.06]Thank you, D-Stroke.
[89:48.08]Again, with a dollar here, too.
[89:50.34]Thank you so much.

[90:10.10]Uh... Beat the heat.
[90:15.52]Beat the heat.
[90:16.60]Beat meat.
[90:17.50]Yeah, I can see that.
[90:21.22]That's so fucking funny.
[90:24.80]Beat the meat.
[90:26.86]Yikes.
[90:29.24]Thank you, dude.
[90:30.34]Thank you, BangDoll, for the ten bucks.
[90:32.56]SwiftRage, thank you, dude.
[90:35.03]Wilma, thanks for the one dollar.
[90:36.59]Snooze, thanks for the one dollar.
[90:37.93]My stepdad is from Boston.
[90:39.19]Does that make us related?
[90:41.87]Yeah.
[90:43.27]We are... neighbors.
[90:46.85]Don't you know that your neighbors are your family members?
[90:50.62]Thanks, dude.
[90:51.08]Thank you, ClavMan, for the five dollars.
[90:55.10]Hey, Jerma, just got back from graduating Coast Guard basic training.
[90:58.64]Getting stationed on a 378-foot cutter doing drug and migrant interdiction along the West Coast.
[91:06.50]Feels good to be back laughing at your crazy sense of humor.
[91:11.22]That's an accomplishment, dude.
[91:13.74]Congratulations on joining the Coast Guard.
[91:19.94]Graduating Coast Guard basic training.
[91:23.16]Good luck to you.
[91:25.56]My brother-in-law is in the Coast Guard.
[91:30.66]And he is... He's doing very well.
[91:37.59]So he loves it.
[91:40.51]Is this the rest of the stream?
[91:43.53]Yes.
[91:44.99]Because my internet doesn't work.
[91:47.01]I'm at... My internet's just tanking and I can't stream.
[91:50.12]So this is... I probably should get off IRL, huh?
[91:55.02]If people are kind of just randomly coming in, I probably should just take it off of IRL.
[92:00.34]Just go into no man's land.
[92:08.89]In-law.
[92:09.27]Yeah, I have an in-law.
[92:10.87]Brother-in-law.
[92:12.25]That means that it's my sister's husband.
[92:15.60]Lore.
[92:17.10]Brother-in-law for the rumble.
[92:18.46]Brother-in-lore.
[92:25.21]Oh my god.
[92:27.51]But, thanks, man.
[92:29.01]Congratulations.
[92:29.67]Good luck to you, Clef.
[92:32.75]A golden fishy thanks for the dollar.
[92:33.93]How is the house her searching going?
[92:36.25]Haven't gone there yet.
[92:37.37]Plan on going there soon.
[92:38.39]I think we've... I think I read this one earlier, but yeah.
[92:40.61]Thank you.
[92:42.86]Thank you, Trash Tank, for the one dollar.
[92:44.24]Jerma, can you show your Photoshop and we play something like Pictionary?
[92:50.22]That actually is not, that's a fun idea.
[92:52.80]I would have to turn on the Twitch, you know, two or three second beta.
[92:58.29]Because the delay, I think, would be too long for that.
[93:00.71]So, maybe we'll do that one day.
[93:01.91]I'll do, like, a Photoshop, like, Pictionary with chat on the no delay beta.
[93:06.17]That would be fun.
[93:10.85]Uh, ESP.
[93:12.76]What is, that was a weird way to say that.
[93:15.57]esp thank you esp underscore unders thank you esp underscore for the ten dollars we don't donate for the individual stream we donate for the streaming individual your dedication to your content and care for your community over all these years is beyond commendable these complications with the internet are unfortunate though out of your power and we greatly appreciate you nonetheless hope you're able to enjoy the rest of your evening
[93:43.15]Again, another incredibly wonderful, nice comment for someone to say.
[93:52.73]I'm at a loss.
[93:55.30]Like, thank you for even thinking that.
[93:59.56]Thank you so much.
[94:06.87]That's like such, these are such nice fucking things to hear.
[94:11.21]But I never want to get complacent, right?
[94:14.49]You know, if somebody tells you that you're doing a good job, you're doing a good job, I don't want to hit the wall that's like, well, I'm doing a good job.
[94:23.67]I'm doing a good job.
[94:24.39]That's it.
[94:24.69]I'm going to do this.
[94:26.24]This is it.
[94:26.92]This is my good job.
[94:29.30]I want to, like I said, I want to keep going.
[94:31.50]I want to try to do more.
[94:38.56]Thank you for the 10 bucks, man.
[94:41.43]And then Lukewarm, oh my god, Lukewarm gave another $20 here.
[94:46.89]No, another $30, like $35.
[94:50.11]Holy shit, dude.
[94:50.83]You've given like over $300 fucking dollars this stream.
[94:59.30]Holy shit.
[95:02.18]Thank you, dude.
[95:04.24]He said, first of all, he said, ask and you shall receive.
[95:08.74]And it is a picture.
[95:13.34]Well, no, I was talking about like a video.
[95:16.74]Here, I was talking about like, do like an elaborate video particle effect.
[95:37.97]That's funny.
[95:41.12]Thanks for that, dude.
[95:42.25]And thanks for the huge amount of money.
[95:44.19]Holy shit, man.
[95:45.81]He's not in night mode?
[95:46.61]I'm not in night mode either.
[95:48.55]I have basic default Twitch.
[95:53.03]Again, Luke, another $10.
[95:55.15]You said, my sides.
[95:56.42]Ow.
[95:56.72]Thank you.
[95:58.98]You also ended in 87th place.
[96:03.42]Not even possible to even play that game, but thanks so much, man.
[96:10.48]Hey, Max G. Shep, thanks for the $1.
[96:12.82]Love your streams, dude.
[96:13.46]Have laughed way too much tonight.
[96:14.64]Lots of love from Rhode Island.
[96:16.42]Good old state of Rhode Island.
[96:19.42]You know where I love in Rhode Island?
[96:20.85]I love Newport.
[96:23.11]Newport has some awesome restaurants.
[96:25.63]Great scenery.
[96:26.21]It's a great place.
[96:31.47]Acknowledge John, thanks for the $1.
[96:35.34]What is that?
[96:36.28]What is it?
[96:36.80]Is that a video game?
[96:37.68]I don't know what that is.
[96:39.12]Thanks though.
[97:05.15]lukewarm soda again for 15 I give you money because like kahoot makes me laugh my ass off and greatly brightens my otherwise sucky days that just doesn't happen on other streams I'm glad that that makes you happy I've told you this before
[97:29.28]I'm just trying to have fun.
[97:32.51]Sometimes I say things or do things that might not be funny or might not be fun, but I'm just having fun doing them.
[97:41.09]That's it.
[97:43.98]And the more I can have fun, the better.
[97:51.16]Because I don't, like I've said this before, I don't want to become just like complacent.
[97:57.93]and just, here's what I'm doing, this is it, I'm just going through the motions, this is what I do, and this is it, and this is what it's going to be like for the rest of my life.
[98:05.09]The rest of my day.
[98:06.29]The rest of my week.
[98:08.35]I don't want to be like that.
[98:09.63]I want to just do whatever.
[98:11.61]Sometimes it doesn't fucking work.
[98:12.87]Sometimes it fails miserably.
[98:14.72]It fucking does.
[98:15.50]It actually does.
[98:17.40]Behind the scenes that you of which have not seen.
[98:22.12]Sometimes there are catastrophic failures that I don't even talk about.
[98:27.06]But
[98:28.54]It is what it is.
[98:30.04]Rest of my life.
[98:38.99]When I get complacent, that's when there's a problem.
[98:46.13]But... Thanks for the 300 bucks, dude.
[98:51.16]Much love to you.
[98:53.58]Wrapping up the end here, getting close.
[98:54.84]Thank you to Modus Pones...
[98:58.81]Mo just pwns for the $4.
[99:01.37]Here's towards a new home and hopefully better internet.
[99:03.45]I wish you luck on your move.
[99:04.45]It must suck to have such bad internet and I hate how sad and mad it makes you.
[99:10.00]It's just the frequency that really pisses me off.
[99:12.08]If this happens like once or twice a year, that's not a problem.
[99:16.21]You know, your internet goes down for a few days and they fix it and it's fine.
[99:20.95]Just every week, every month, there's like two weeks out of the month, three weeks out of like the... It's just... It's the frequency that just really drives the nail under my skin.
[99:33.80]But thank you, Modus.
[99:35.02]Appreciate it.
[99:37.26]Mighty Waffle, thanks for the dollar.
[99:38.28]I think this represents the state of jermaSaturn very well.
[99:40.74]Okay.
[99:41.91]Okay.
[99:52.04]What?
[99:54.74]It's him.
[99:56.28]It's him.
[99:59.67]Yeah, it's... that's it.
[100:01.69]It's him.
[100:04.41]It doesn't really convey anything.
[100:05.73]It's just... there he is.
[100:06.45]He's there.
[100:07.69]But that's how Saturn is anyways.
[100:10.84]Saturn just exists.
[100:12.20]It doesn't do anything.
[100:14.76]Saturn's not huge.
[100:16.39]Saturn's not really cold or gassy or explosive.
[100:20.31]It's just him.
[100:21.27]Saturn's just there.
[100:22.55]It doesn't do anything.
[100:24.37]It's the worst planet.
[100:27.15]It just has a funny halo around it.
[100:36.16]But thank you, Debunk Weefunk, again for the 50 bucks.
[100:39.54]Huge thank you.

[101:38.38]Thank you.
[101:38.88]Thank you, MooMeansMoo, for the $5.
[101:40.12]Haven't been able to catch as many of the streams lately.

[101:56.20]And then PiePie, thanks for the $10.
[101:57.94]Will you ever make another t-shirt?
[101:59.14]I would buy it in a heartbeat.
[102:00.34]My glue man tee got holes in it.
[102:03.31]Yes.
[102:04.63]It just... It has to click.
[102:06.79]The gears have to click together and the planets need to align.
[102:10.96]And yes, there will be more t-shirts, I promise.
[102:14.06]I've just been... I'm 100% focused on moving right now.
[102:20.03]So that's the thing.
[102:20.97]I have to focus on one thing.
[102:22.47]Otherwise, I can't do it.
[102:24.56]So cleaning up my house, moving out of here, finding a place maybe temporarily, getting to Las Vegas, moving in, that's the number one thing I have to think about.
[102:36.25]But yes, once I'm settled in the next couple of months, yes, absolutely.
[102:44.14]But thank you for the $10, dude.
[102:47.04]Gonderlane, thanks for the $1.
[102:48.56]The other guy reminded me that today's my birthday.
[102:51.96]Thanks for making my day better.
[102:52.96]I genuinely hope you managed to find peace in whatever heaven is meant for streamer clowns.
[102:58.94]Love you, Jeremy.
[103:03.00]Thank you, lukewarm soda can again for the $1 adding to your monumental total.
[103:07.54]We're still having a fun time here.
[103:09.24]Good.
[103:11.35]I'm glad.
[103:12.15]I really am.
[103:15.07]razzle2 thanks for the one dollar hey Jerm there is a pretty cool game on Steam called megaton rainfall you're a superhero and you try to save the world and I think you get a kick out of it I would post this in the Discord but I'm banned from a raunchy meme I posted a year ago
[103:47.13]This happened a year ago Hey, sorry, I would but you know I got banned from posting a fucking raunchy meme a year ago.

[104:44.71]A lot, very much so.
[104:50.86]You guys have impacted my life more than you could ever possibly even remotely imagine.
[104:59.72]So.
[105:05.40]Thank you.
[105:10.48]Much appreciated.
[105:11.66]For real.
[105:13.75]Trash Tank, thanks for the five dollars.
[105:15.69]Uh, thank you for making me laugh so hard this stream and making it work a little easier to get through.

[105:29.76]Uh, Fizzy Milk, thanks for the one dollar.
[105:31.32]Keep it up, Jeremy.
[105:31.98]You're my favorite streamer.
[105:32.80]I never fail to put a smile on my face.
[105:34.14]Oh, and stay woke.
[105:37.92]Uh,
[105:39.58]I will.
[105:40.34]I will try.
[105:40.80]I will try to stay awake.
[105:44.08]I told you, I'm doing a no sleep, no food, no water, woke stream.
[105:50.68]That's today.
[105:51.16]That was today.
[105:51.64]I did it.
[105:55.98]Thank you, though, Fizzy Milk.
[106:00.40]Also, again, lukewarm soda can for another $3.
[106:02.92]Thank you.
[106:07.58]What is, what are you at now?
[106:08.60]You're at like $300 and 50, 350, $3, 305.
[106:12.16]Holy shit, dude.
[106:16.90]Thank you.
[106:19.20]Uh, Luke Warm says, I'm doing much better and it took me almost five years to get there.
[106:23.47]There were ups, there were downs, and in the lowest points, I could still watch your old YouTube videos or tune into a stream to feel better.
[106:29.49]I would legitimately, legitimately attribute my ability...
[106:34.42]to just continue getting up every day and continue existing to several extremely positive and entertaining people like you.
[106:40.10]You have affected a lot of your fanbase positively throughout the years.
[106:47.29]Well, I mean, if you could take anything from this stream, I'm glad you can.
[106:53.06]I take that like fucking seriously, you know what I mean?
[106:55.62]If you can actually take something fun or interesting that you thought was fun or that made you think about something, made you try something, that is so important to me.
[107:09.76]I can't even believe that this is a reality.
[107:12.80]Sometimes I wake up and I can't even believe it's a real thing.
[107:20.92]Did you miss me playing Dark Souls?
[107:22.10]Yeah, we tried it for a little while, but the internet couldn't do it.
[107:36.57]They say... Do what you love to do is an easy thing to say.
[107:47.31]It's hard to do anything.
[107:50.03]I'm talking about, like, having depression and having, like, anxiety and stuff.
[107:54.97]Everyone always kind of puts, like, the blanket statement, like, you know, just do what you love.
[107:59.45]And make sure you have fun every day.
[108:01.95]Like, I've said things like that, but it's a fucking process.
[108:04.55]It's a huge process to get anywhere.
[108:07.99]A lot more difficult than, like... I'm 32.
[108:14.03]And even something like five years ago, I was like, I can't.
[108:17.87]What am I gonna do?
[108:18.59]I can't do shit.
[108:22.44]And you hear the people say, like, no, just keep going.
[108:25.00]Keep working, keep having, trying, doing things.
[108:27.32]And you're like, what do you know?
[108:32.16]But it just takes a long fucking time.
[108:37.08]And also, you also have to be willing to give it the time it deserves.
[108:43.31]To make yourself better.
[108:44.31]To make you try to climb up the ladder over the mountain.
[108:49.15]And it sucks and it's really horrible to think about this.
[108:52.46]But some people get dealt really shit cards, really bad fucking cards.
[109:03.46]And it's terrible to think about that.
[109:13.84]But... Some people, it's like, some people get the game on easy, some people get the game on hard.
[109:24.66]And it's really, anytime I hear about people that have it on like fucking hard mode.
[109:29.71]You just try to think about, you put yourself in their shoes.
[109:32.21]You try to put yourself in their situation and think about how they would feel.
[109:34.85]How would I feel if XYZ happened, right?
[109:40.65]And that's why you don't play Hearthstone.
[109:48.31]But there is no easy blanket answer.
[109:54.63]I wish there was.
[109:59.61]But to add on top of that, if things help, then I'm glad they do.
[110:15.63]But you gotta take care of yourself as best you can.
[110:17.96]You gotta try.
[110:20.60]You know, like, I've thought about this before.
[110:22.64]You get one chance.
[110:24.88]You only get one shot.
[110:28.08]You only get one shot.
[110:30.04]Why not fucking try to do whatever?
[110:32.77]To do anything?
[110:35.41]You get that one chance.
[110:38.23]Here you go.
[110:38.79]Like, boom!
[110:39.79]You came out of somebody.
[110:42.11]There you are.
[110:43.93]Whoa, I didn't know I was never alive before this.
[110:47.01]I'm a person now.
[110:49.06]whoa okay I get one this is it I got one chance here one shot why not just try to do as best you can that's all you can do you got one shot one chance one opportunity make sure you lose yourself in the music did you just yolo us no
[111:12.36]My when people know look you're deaf at the definition of like the YOLO like you only live once therefore Snort a bunch of coke and go fight a homeless guy.
[111:20.85]No no no no that no not like no Change the definition of that word like you only you only live once is used for like I'm gonna like Drive off that cliff and see if I live like no no no no no not YOLO We're talking about you get one chance, right?
[111:36.31]You only live once no You get one chance
[111:41.84]You get one chance.

[111:59.87]What the?
[112:00.97]I just read something.
[112:03.33]You get one chance.
[112:04.29]Not you only live once.
[112:13.77]You gotta, you gotta E-Gawk it, man.

[112:39.10]Press E. You gotta press E.
[112:44.50]Alright, let's wrap it up.
[112:51.14]Maybe my insane person rambling may have made sense to people, I don't know.
[112:59.03]But thank you Smellyboy for the $1.
[113:00.35]Is the next Jerma live action or 2K14 the only options?
[113:02.79]No.
[113:09.33]I haven't really even started thinking about it yet.
[113:11.43]Because there's other things in the pipeline that I didn't want to do first.
[113:14.86]But we'll see.
[113:16.10]Thank you, Snooze, for the $1.
[113:17.42]So if my stepdad from Boston is living with my family in Ohio, we are still neighbors.
[113:22.96]Also, my mom wants to invite you over for the 4th of July cookout now that she knows we're all related.
[113:27.34]No bouncy houses, but you can still meet my dog.
[113:29.41]Her name is Teddy.
[113:31.35]Yeah, yes, you are all family members.
[113:35.56]That is your, uh, your uncle neighbor.
[113:39.10]Always will be.
[113:42.00]Thank you, Wild Hubbuddy, for the $1.
[113:43.58]Since we are all saying how much we love you, Jerma, you're my favorite entertainer out there.
[113:48.73]Seriously, I don't think there's a person or a group that I'd love to see more than your content.
[113:51.65]Thank you for everything.
[113:54.85]I wish there were more ways for me to express my gratitude.
[113:59.77]You know, like, hearing this shit, like, hearing this shit over and over again, it's like, I wish I could show you guys
[114:06.70]Like, that's what, like, a lot of the purpose of some of this shit is.
[114:09.32]Like, trying to get more things done.
[114:11.04]Trying to make... Spend more time on stuff.
[114:17.95]I wish there was a way for me to show it more.
[114:20.67]Because... You guys are nothing but... Super supportive and, like, thankful and helpful to me and shit.
[114:30.12]I wish there was another way I could prove that I also think you guys are great.
[114:43.58]Give us money.
[114:44.34]So, like, I'm gonna pay you guys back.
[114:48.48]Time to pay the chat.
[114:51.86]Just do, like, an airdrop of, like, a bit to everybody.
[115:01.57]Thank you, guys.
[115:03.50]And then Moo right after that said, for a dollar, thank you.
[115:06.84]That guy nailed it.
[115:07.46]We don't sub or donate because of the streams.
[115:09.16]We donate and sub because we want to support you and repay you for all the great things you do for your community.
[115:14.33]Keep doing what you're doing.
[115:15.13]You're one of the greats.
[115:16.71]Can't wait to see what comes next.
[115:18.65]I'm going to give it a shot, man.
[115:21.41]Going to give it a shot.
[115:22.14]We'll see.
[115:23.04]Thank you.
[115:25.09]Thank you, Sputa, for the $5.
[115:26.53]Don't worry, once your internet works again, we'll all be back to bullying you in Dark Souls.
[115:30.67]Oh, by the way, your Dark Souls character looks like a shadow of Yharnam.
[115:33.63]And Sen's Fortress is a chalice dungeon.
[115:38.48]What a great game.
[115:41.34]Thank you, Sputa.
[115:43.68]Cloudy, thanks for the $1.
[115:45.26]Dispachio is a meme.
[115:47.72]Come on, Jerma, catch up on your memes.
[115:49.22]I don't read the memes weekly, man.
[115:52.06]I don't read the newspaper.
[115:56.18]Thank you Wilma for the $1.
[115:57.76]You are the most wholesome content creator ever.
[116:00.36]You make me laugh.
[116:01.20]Thank you.
[116:04.68]Thank you.
[116:08.02]Thank you.
[116:09.84]Thank you Darkstar for the $1.
[116:11.42]Wah, wah, look at me.
[116:12.88]I'm Jerma and I've made some of the funniest YouTube and Twitch content ever and have a loving and supporting fanbase that cares for my well-being.
[116:26.55]But don't you understand?
[116:28.54]Don't you understand?
[116:29.02]That's like, I... It's hard.
[116:32.10]It's very hard for me to explain.
[116:35.88]This is the best I can do after missing the whole stream.
[116:41.16]Thank you, Darkstar.
[116:43.29]Getting to the end, thank you Max G. Shep for the four... You know, I'm just going to answer it.
[116:51.78]What's my favorite game that was at E3?
[116:53.32]Probably the Dark Souls game, or Hitman 2, or Battletoads, or Cuphead DLC, or that game that The Witcher people are making that's not a Witcher game, it's a cyberpunk game where you put implants into your head and you can see, you can scan the environment, or the new Bugs Bunny game that's coming up.
[117:10.31]Can't wait for that one.
[117:10.99]Bugs Bunny presents Looney Tunes on the run.
[117:13.58]It looked like an awesome exclusive.
[117:16.08]I can't wait.
[117:18.62]Thank you to Simenly for the three bucks.
[117:21.12]They say tomato.
[117:22.94]I don't know what that means.
[117:25.22]Thank you.
[117:27.25]Dingustown, thanks for the five dollars.
[117:28.75]I like you.
[117:29.81]Thank you, Dingustown.
[117:31.71]For the five bucks.
[117:33.31]Bob the Pineapple, thanks for five dollars and 45 cents.
[117:35.41]Hey, Jermanist, wanted to say that I love your streams.
[117:36.83]Keep it up.
[117:37.95]Ow.
[117:38.23]I will.
[117:38.51]I gotta make this out of foam, dude.
[117:41.95]I will.
[117:42.24]I'm gonna try.
[117:44.19]And then thank you SticksRenegade at the very end here.
[117:46.41]What happened?
[117:47.05]I was gone since 7.
[117:50.01]We played a game that broke the game's servers.
[117:54.49]And then I ranted about Microsoft and Internet.
[117:58.16]And then the Internet died again.
[117:59.78]And then we just hung out and unread some bits.
[118:03.86]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[118:06.90]I couldn't stop it.
[118:08.54]I couldn't stop it.
[118:14.83]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[118:16.57]We're going to try again.
[118:18.33]Try to play Dark Souls tomorrow afternoon.
[118:21.55]Take care, everybody.
[118:23.09]See you soon.
[118:24.37]And Darkstar, thanks for the dollar.
[118:25.67]Are you fucking serious, Time Warner?
[118:27.37]Right as Jeremy reads my goddamn bits, you just have to buffer.
[118:30.31]I'm loading 360p.
[118:33.94]Not 5K smell-o-vision.
[118:35.36]Yeah, internets are stupid.
[118:37.54]And then MooMeansMoo, thanks for $1.
[118:39.06]Suck a fart out of my ass, Jeremy Wholesome Elbertson.
[118:42.20]Thank you.
[118:44.03]Good night.
[118:45.19]Pray for the internet works tomorrow.
[118:46.31]We're going to try again.
[118:47.07]And I will see you guys soon.
[118:49.07]Take care, everybody.
[118:49.81]Much love.
[118:50.27]Have a good rest of your evening.
[118:51.81]Eat your fucking vegetables.
[118:52.77]Drink your yogurt.
[118:54.07]And you know what?
[118:57.30]Call your mother.
[118:58.70]She hasn't heard from you in a long time.
[119:00.24]It's been like a week.
[119:03.84]Call your mother.
[119:05.08]She's asking about you.
[119:08.12]Alright.
[119:08.38]Goodbye.
[119:08.72]Good night.
[119:35.52]Thanks mostly lost for the $1.
[119:36.38]You thought the stream was over, but it was me.
[119:37.92]Yes, it's over.
[119:38.68]Bye.
[120:00.58]Thank you.
