[01:34.95]I'm late?
[01:35.31]Yeah, I know.
[01:36.67]I am well aware of my lateness, my tardiness.
[01:40.08]It's alright.
[01:41.70]What was that?
[01:44.70]Getting old.
[01:49.40]Nobody came to Thanksgiving.
[01:50.69]What?
[01:53.31]Nobody came to Thanksgiving.
[01:54.53]Wait, what?
[01:58.25]That's not good.
[02:01.95]Yeah, we're gonna play Logical Journey of the Zumbinis finally.
[02:05.83]It's taken us a long enough time to do it.
[02:09.35]Pie, turned out nobody liked my pie.
[02:11.37]It was too cream cheesy.
[02:14.10]I liked it, though.
[02:14.92]And I ate every fucking bite of it.
[02:17.18]It's too cream chee- Oh, there's too much cream cheese in your pie.
[02:20.50]Shut up.
[02:22.70]Shut up.
[02:23.72]Shut up, Uncle Frank.
[02:29.87]Kicked his ass in Monopoly five fucking minutes later, though.
[02:32.77]Guarantee you that.
[02:45.65]Fuck you, Uncle Frank.
[02:48.62]Now, give me one second.
[02:49.84]I want to grab a drink.
[02:53.04]Should have used vanilla pudding.
[02:56.00]I don't really like pudding.
[02:58.32]You know, I don't really like pudding.
[03:00.92]I'm going to come out and say it.
[03:03.26]Hey, Sticks, right off the bat, thanks for the one dollar.
[03:05.52]Jerma is late, means little and tiny entity, so that's why he's forever... Oh, you got me with that one.
[03:15.99]Late and tiny entity.
[03:19.77]Look, I'd rather be small than huge.
[03:22.33]Do you know how hard it is to be Shaq?
[03:25.78]Shaq has to get custom cars made for him.
[03:28.76]Do you guys understand that?
[03:31.18]Imagine if you had to order a custom shoe because you were so big that you can't use regular clothes.
[03:45.21]Shaq can't fit in a car.
[03:52.98]Go look up, type into Google, can Shaq fit in a car?
[03:57.70]first thing you're gonna see is Shaq doesn't fit inside a car and like it shows his head sticking out like whoa what the fuck I'm telling you there's people all like around like pointing like whoa I'm not looking it up that's that's on you he can't no he can't
[04:23.95]You try to fit Shaq in a Toyota Prius, he's not going to fit.
[04:29.47]First himself says he can.
[04:31.15]Hey, thank you, Turian, for the $5.
[04:35.38]And Smokewise Ganja for the $1.
[04:36.62]Hey, I'm looking for some love advice.
[04:40.30]Her name is Noelle.
[04:41.22]I had a dream about her.
[04:43.29]She rings my bell.
[04:46.42]Don't come to me for love advice.
[04:47.58]I won't be able to give it to you.
[04:49.44]But thank you, Smokewise.
[04:50.40]Oh, so Turian, thanks for the $5.
[04:51.76]Hey, Jeremy, just wanted to let you know that your streams have helped me through a lot of tough times in life.
[04:56.04]Currently serving a life sentence in prison, and your content really helps me get through the day-to-day.
[05:00.29]I didn't do it, by the way.
[05:01.31]I was framed.
[05:02.79]Well, Turian, get yourself a good fucking lawyer.
[05:07.53]If you didn't do it, then get yourself a good lawyer that can prove it.
[05:13.72]But thank you for, I don't know how you're giving me $5 for prison, but you are.
[05:16.88]Thank you.
[05:17.76]Dr. Pig, Dr. Pigeth, thanks for the $5.
[05:19.90]Hey, Jerma's been like six months as I've given bits.
[05:22.67]I'm getting deprived.
[05:24.25]I gotta keep the meme alive, even though it was never alive to begin with.
[05:27.17]Happy fake real birthday, Cody sucks.
[05:29.27]I love you.
[05:30.39]Thank you.
[05:32.29]Also, Eamon Ford for the $1.
[05:33.83]Thank you.
[05:34.37]Hello, Sausage.
[05:35.41]What is Sausage?
[05:37.05]And Lyle McAwesome, thanks for the $1.
[05:39.43]First time on stream.
[05:40.27]Can't wait.
[05:40.69]Well, neither can I. I'm so fucking glad you... Ow.
[05:43.93]I'm so glad you're here.
[05:46.53]I got a little too excited because you're here.
[05:51.97]Alright, let's do it.
[05:54.89]I didn't even get my drink.
[05:55.71]Let's move over to the other screen.
[06:01.75]which oh hey look here's the Zoombinis make sure I can see what I'm doing over here yeah I can I can see alright you know let me can I please grab a drink like I promise I'll be one second I'm gonna sprint upstairs and get one I'm gonna sprint you're gonna be able to hear it it's gonna be like
[07:18.96]See?
[07:19.10]I'm back.
[07:20.50]I'm back already.
[07:21.12]Don't nobody freak out.
[07:22.42]He's here.
[07:23.94]He's here, and he's ready to play the logical journey of the- I ran too fast.
[07:29.35]That's a bunch of air that was just- I didn't, like, drink anything.
[07:31.65]That was literally air bouncing around because I ran too fast.
[07:34.89]Okay.
[07:36.09]So.
[07:37.59]For those of you guys that don't understand what this game is, the logical journey of the Zoombinis is an old game.
[07:47.65]tell you like a 60 when something... My body's going through some changes, apparently.
[07:54.35]Anyways.
[07:55.55]Logical Journey of the Zumbinis is an old game for children.
[07:59.39]So don't worry, we're gonna blow through this pretty easily.
[08:02.97]The whole goal... You know, we could play the cutscene.
[08:04.91]How do I play the cutscene?
[08:08.09]Can I play the opening cutscene?
[08:11.47]Well, the opening cutscene's kind of boring, though.
[08:13.89]So we don't really need to watch it.
[08:18.21]It might help you guys understand.
[08:20.16]It's okay.
[08:23.10]Who cares?
[08:24.86]Everything you need to know is here, actually.
[08:27.38]The journey begins here.
[08:28.14]Select traits to create a crew of 16 Zumbinis.
[08:31.86]But remember, each Zumbini in this crew must be unique.
[08:35.20]You make 16 people, and you have to get them to an island.
[08:39.30]And you have to solve puzzles along the way, and people die.
[08:43.34]Zumbinis can get killed.
[08:44.58]He's saying, I'm on back.
[08:46.88]What are you talking about?
[08:51.95]I'm here.
[08:53.07]I'm here.
[08:53.35]What are you guys talking about?
[08:55.65]You don't need lore.
[08:56.29]We just have to make random people.
[08:57.62]It doesn't matter.
[08:59.84]There's no naming anybody.
[09:01.90]You just have to make them funny looking.
[09:03.54]You can name them.
[09:04.96]Shit.
[09:05.28]No, you can't.
[09:07.62]No, there is no naming them.
[09:08.58]Sorry, guys.
[09:11.57]Whoops.
[09:12.05]I just accidentally... No, no, no, no, no.
[09:13.79]Don't do all of them.
[09:14.83]Oh, what the fuck?
[09:17.22]I just randomly generated every single person.
[09:19.96]We were going to go through this and make it fun.
[09:22.46]Well, now we... And they all have like the small eyes.
[09:27.20]God damn it.
[09:29.24]You know... I understand what happened.
[09:35.80]I gotta rectify this pretty quickly, because the issue that I have here is that I didn't take my brain fluid.
[09:44.32]That's the problem.
[09:45.68]I didn't get to have that yet.
[09:47.20]If you don't know what brain fluid is, it is a supplement.
[09:51.12]Now, I know, hold on, I know what you're thinking.
[09:52.88]Like, Jeremiah, we don't want to do this.
[09:55.20]We don't want to do supplement bullshit right now.
[09:57.29]But we are.
[09:58.51]It's very easy.
[10:00.09]It's very easy to do.
[10:03.44]First of all, this is not a joke.
[10:05.90]People think this is, like, actually a joke.
[10:09.54]It's not, because here it is.
[10:12.22]I got contacted by this company.
[10:14.42]They're a local company out of somewhere in Rhode Island, I think.
[10:19.09]I'm not sure.
[10:20.41]But anyways, this is supposed to help with focus.
[10:22.87]If you have trouble focusing like I do sometimes.
[10:25.55]I have trouble focusing.
[10:26.51]I have trouble reading.
[10:27.41]I have trouble reading at an 8th grade level, so.
[10:29.83]Let's see if we can get this to work.
[10:31.57]So this one, this is...
[10:37.71]Swear to God every time I try to do something like this It's brain fluid look it up So first of all this is grape.
[10:47.11]We're gonna put this in here and hopefully it works These are not drugs.
[10:52.86]They're not drugs everybody's freaking out already.
[10:55.38]It's look this is water It's water This one is for focus.
[11:03.22]This is called grape intensity
[11:06.46]what you want to do is you want to take you want to take your bottle your vial and I think it's only what is it two scoops I think it's two scoops this is just brain fluid guys you put it right in here right in the vial two scoops is all you need this one like I said grape intensity that's the one you want to use if you have trouble focusing
[11:34.43]And then just a little bit of water.
[11:35.41]Let's get the stopper here.
[11:38.58]You don't need very much.
[11:39.20]You just need enough.
[11:39.94]Remember, we're talking about just a little bit of water.
[11:42.18]Don't overdo it.
[11:44.28]Just like that.
[11:44.78]And see, when it fizzles up like that, that means you're doing a good job.
[11:47.10]You want to get a little bit more.
[11:49.48]Let it get all shaked up in there.
[11:51.40]Need a little bit more water, unfortunately.
[11:55.66]Like that.
[11:58.07]And then you want to...
[12:04.02]You want to get... It can get a little fizzy on you, but that's okay.
[12:07.02]This is brain fluid.
[12:07.75]This is the grape intensity.
[12:13.29]It's not bad.
[12:13.75]It's actually okay.
[12:14.39]It's pretty good.
[12:19.89]There's a whole lot of fluid in there.
[12:21.63]We're going to make this a little easier.
[12:23.62]Remember, this one is for if you're studying or if you're trying to get better grades.
[12:28.30]This one has vitamin A, vitamin X, and I think there's a little bit of horse urine in this.
[12:36.31]Yeah, this helps with concentration, too.
[12:39.58]I can already feel it starting.
[12:42.10]I can already feel it happening.
[12:43.08]Like, I can feel right now my blood turning a different color.
[12:47.10]You know what I mean?
[12:47.56]Like, you know when people say that, we use that as a terminology?
[12:53.18]That's good.
[12:54.24]That's really good.
[12:55.72]Woo!
[12:58.35]Okay, I feel...
[13:00.96]I already feel like it's fucking working.
[13:02.94]My whole body is in full-on intensity mode.
[13:08.14]What's this next one?
[13:10.36]This one is... This one is Raspberry Gotcha.
[13:16.81]We'll try what this one is like.
[13:20.01]This one, Raspberry Gotcha.
[13:21.64]This one says on the, on the, I can't really read that, my vision's getting a little weird.
[13:25.88]This one says for, specifically for calming down and for napping.
[13:32.26]This is supposed to, I guess it has like certain chemicals and feedback, feedback loops.
[13:39.39]I think it's something that, whatever it said.
[13:40.73]So remember, you take a little bit of water.
[13:43.67]And shake that up there.
[13:44.47]This is for getting some tired sleepiness in there.
[13:48.13]Just going to put some water in there and let it shake it up a little.
[13:59.18]This will make it so if you have a long day at work and you need to really just
[14:05.38]bring yourself down into the sheets it can be very difficult sometimes especially if there are people that are fucking beeping at you on the road and stuff like that I've been there before commuting is not fun it sucks what is this one this one this one says like I actually I actually can't read this one I'm having a little bit of trouble like reading this one
[14:33.20]This one's Watermelon Shakedown.
[14:35.72]What do you want to do with this one?
[15:08.24]Now this one says that you're only supposed to drink this once a day rather than the other one.
[15:13.11]So this one's a little bit heavier in liquid.
[15:19.11]There's another one here.
[15:23.33]This one, what does this one say?
[15:30.00]This one says to only be used while driving a car.
[15:42.26]I don't know why that matters.
[15:45.71]You guys think number six?
[15:46.77]Do you guys think six is a cool number?
[15:50.37]Something like that?
[15:52.41]I think six is like a really interesting number.
[15:54.69]At least I would say so.
[15:55.63]I don't understand.
[16:18.79]Okay, I'm ready to play the Zumbiniville.
[16:21.29]That's different.
[17:03.17]Ready to play.
[17:03.71]That's my brain fluid.
[17:04.45]Remember when you check a bunch of brain fluid dot, uh, dot whatever?
[17:19.99]The light's green.
[17:26.81]Alright, here we go.
[17:33.22]I'm all amped up.
[17:34.28]I got my fucking brain fluid.
[17:36.58]Let's go.
[17:47.87]After days tossed about by a stormy sea, the Zumbinis reach the shore of a peculiar land.
[17:56.35]If you don't know what this game is, well, let's go.
[17:58.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[17:58.91]First of all, first of all, Edgemont gave $50.
[18:00.90]What the hell am I watching?
[18:03.86]Is Jerma overdosing on brain fluid?
[18:05.86]Not possible.
[18:07.44]It's a nutraceutical.
[18:08.82]It's not possible to overdose on it.
[18:13.37]But holy shit.
[18:16.46]Am I getting, like, fucking full of air?
[18:20.78]Alright, character creation's done.
[18:23.82]So, if you don't know how to... This game is a... It's a logical deduction, is the Zumbinis.
[18:30.27]It's a game of logical deduction.
[18:31.67]You have to... First of all, this guy's got glasses, right?
[18:35.13]There are some cases where this guy can only do certain things.
[18:38.79]This guy with the hair, the guy with the blue nose, the red nose.
[18:42.20]You have to get everybody across these bridges.
[18:45.20]This guy's going to sneeze on you if you get it wrong.
[18:48.35]So first of all, let's grab this person.
[18:51.43]And look, it's just deduction, right?
[18:54.17]So I'm going to put this person across this bridge.
[18:55.59]Okay, well, she's dead.
[18:59.52]No, she's not dead.
[19:00.14]She's not dead.
[19:01.14]She's alive.
[19:01.54]That means she has to go on the other side.
[19:03.00]There's a reason why she has to go on the other side.
[19:07.66]See?
[19:08.12]Now she can pass perfectly normally.
[19:10.22]Now, is that because did he not like her hair?
[19:14.54]Did he not like her spindy doodle?
[19:16.02]Did he not like her yellow nose?
[19:17.68]I don't know.
[19:18.74]But she had a yellow nose and that hair, so we're going to see if it's a nose thing.
[19:23.68]Can this guy make it across?
[19:25.66]He can.
[19:27.04]I'm going to assume I'm going to assume that it's a yellow nose thing.
[19:31.32]Let's try it again.
[19:35.02]Oh, it has to be.
[19:38.33]Everybody with a yellow nose get on the top bridge.
[19:40.59]That's not what it is.
[19:42.29]So what do these people all share in common?
[19:47.63]I don't understand.
[19:49.91]If it's not a yellow nose thing, then what is it?
[19:54.68]Maybe this person doesn't like wheels?
[19:58.82]Easy game.
[19:59.44]It's not an easy game.
[20:00.50]This game was like impossible to beat when I was 14.
[20:09.22]Hats?
[20:10.35]Maybe it is the hat.
[20:11.71]Alright, go over here.
[20:12.33]So let's try to put another person with a hat over here.
[20:20.47]Yeah, that's probably it.
[20:22.05]So everybody that doesn't have a hat, you're going to go this way.
[20:26.76]We figured it out.
[20:28.76]Game done.
[20:31.16]Just queue them up.
[20:32.56]Only two people have no hat.
[20:34.68]Well, we have a hat.
[20:37.37]Sometimes they have a little bit of a meltdown, and actually this game can be scary.
[20:43.95]This is one of the most heavily requested games on this fucking channel, by the way.
[20:47.93]If you weren't sure.
[20:48.95]I can just feel the fucking energy.
[20:57.23]So we got all 16 across.
[20:58.67]This is how the game works.
[21:02.30]So I guess it's, see?
[21:09.14]It gets much harder.
[21:10.76]How do you know this is the most requested?
[21:20.21]It is!
[21:20.91]This is the most requested game on the channel.
[21:27.81]Zumbini's one guard won't allow.
[21:30.81]The other guard surely will.
[21:35.01]That's more content than Battlefront.
[21:40.00]Here they come!
[21:41.04]This is where they get the characters.
[21:42.08]More of those little pebbles.
[21:45.26]So these, again, same scenario.
[21:49.34]So these rock people, there's four paths.
[21:53.47]So each one of these paths, obviously, what the hell is going on?
[21:55.81]Why is my computer freaking out?
[21:57.61]What is going on?
[21:58.45]Oh, God damn it.
[21:59.61]Don't even tell me that I fucking ruined a keyboard.
[22:05.40]I did.
[22:14.87]It's alt-tabbing because I got the keyboard wet, I think.
[22:22.89]Yep.
[22:27.80]Hold on a second, let me... Hold on, can you see me?
[22:32.30]Can you see me?
[22:34.46]There we go, that's better.
[22:39.50]Can I fucking... Alright, let's... I don't think I need the keyboard.
[22:46.06]No, we're good, we're good.
[22:46.94]It's okay, everything's fine.
[22:52.52]Why don't I fucking close the keyboard next time?
[22:54.70]Push the fucking keyboard in!
[22:57.98]I got towels down here.
[23:01.04]Just bear with me for a second.
[23:02.26]I'm just going to turn the keyboard over here like this.
[23:10.87]There we go.
[23:11.23]That's better.
[23:11.65]Are we good?
[23:13.21]No, we're good.
[23:15.33]Okay.
[23:15.99]So same scenario.
[23:17.99]These guys, they'll stop you.
[23:20.35]There's four paths.
[23:22.61]Same idea.
[23:24.01]We'll try this way.
[23:26.40]It doesn't want me up there.
[23:28.43]Sorry, pal.
[23:30.11]No, so... I might be able to get... I can't get past him here, so this guy has to go this way.
[23:36.45]You don't like that.
[23:38.17]Why?
[23:40.89]So, obviously, you have to go up this path on the left.
[23:43.21]Kind of slow, ain't ya?
[23:44.65]Whatever that means.
[23:45.21]One of the chosen few.
[23:46.77]So, I wonder if that's a hair thing.
[23:47.95]Is that a hat thing or a hair thing?
[23:49.43]Let's see.
[23:51.99]One of the chosen few.
[23:53.01]I think that's a hair thing.
[23:53.94]The guys with the sloppy Sonic hair can go up this way.
[23:57.04]Step in.
[23:58.39]Anybody else have that hair?
[24:02.84]No.
[24:03.22]That's it for the hair on that side.
[24:04.46]Alright, what about... Can you go this way?
[24:09.50]No.
[24:11.60]You can't.
[24:12.32]Same side.
[24:14.66]The reason why we're playing this game, guys, is because of the pizza.
[24:18.80]That's all I care about.
[24:19.54]Because I want to make the pizza.
[24:21.25]You'll see in about fucking 20 minutes.
[24:26.31]Okay, so...
[24:29.04]maybe I think it is a hair thing so maybe you let's test that theory okay guys can you hear that can you hear that hold on just a second there's a bird in my keyboard did you please tell me somebody heard that
[24:57.47]There was actually a fucking bird in the keyboard.
[24:59.77]Hold on.
[25:01.99]Everything's alright.
[25:06.78]It was a very... Here it comes again.
[25:09.88]That's fine.
[25:10.52]We're good.
[25:14.07]Ponytail, left please.
[25:15.37]Go.
[25:18.35]What of the chosen view?
[25:22.83]So if you fail a certain amount of times, then everybody dies down here, essentially.
[25:28.51]You have to get like 500 people to the island.
[25:33.16]It's going to take me like seven months to beat this.
[25:38.30]You too.
[25:38.68]We've got like the sprout haircut, the 1930s haircut.
[25:44.96]I wonder if you guys can go this way.
[25:50.49]Alright, so you have to go up here, this haircut, up that way.
[25:52.81]Right side.
[25:54.87]Kinda slow, ain't you?
[25:55.99]No, this is not Cuphead.
[26:01.29]Go on.
[26:03.06]Go on.
[26:05.10]I think that's correct.
[26:06.06]It is.
[26:06.80]Everybody with the sprout, go up the right- Whoa!
[26:12.92]That's not correct.
[26:16.02]So what's the pro- is it the shoes?
[26:18.10]Is it the fact of wheels, maybe?
[26:21.07]Move it, Toots.
[26:23.32]Okay, so maybe it's the- only wheels can go that way?
[26:28.14]I'm gonna assume that's what's going on.
[26:29.46]Okay, by me.
[26:30.24]Remember, we're- we're on like the- Oh, shit.
[26:34.62]Not right.
[26:37.67]No.
[26:38.71]So how- what is it then?
[26:39.87]I don't understand.
[26:41.99]Eyes?
[26:42.53]Bye-bye.
[26:43.41]It's not the eyes either.
[26:48.98]What?
[26:55.62]Has anybody figured this out?
[26:56.56]Because I don't know why only one guy's allowed over there.
[27:04.57]Okay, only one guy.
[27:06.91]The pink nose, but what?
[27:09.65]So only pink noses can go that way and everybody else can go over here?
[27:12.95]That seems a little odd.
[27:15.58]Good of you to drop in.
[27:17.51]And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland until they meet Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry... This is why we downloaded this.
[27:30.32]This is the only play.
[27:31.22]This is the only reason why.
[27:32.02]Flinges?
[27:34.30]You're not flings.
[27:38.04]Here we go.
[27:39.00]Huh.
[27:42.30]Whatever you are.
[27:43.82]Make me a pizza!
[27:46.74]I remember sitting here for hours playing this game just to make this guy pizza.
[27:52.45]Where are the other two?
[27:53.39]I think the difficulty needs to be a little bit higher.
[27:56.69]Yeah, look, you know, we're gonna leave him.
[27:58.87]Look, we gotta do the journey.
[28:00.87]We gotta... Come on.
[28:03.91]It's too easy.
[28:06.55]We have to do the journey on... We gotta go, like, a little harder.
[28:10.33]We're gonna go very hard.
[28:13.97]Because this is- there's just two other characters there.
[28:16.85]Very- no, not very, very hard.
[28:18.33]Just very hard.
[28:19.11]I'm not in the fucking 11th grade yet.
[28:23.19]We're gonna go with just- no, not very, very hard.
[28:27.13]Oh my god, guys, really?
[28:30.22]But I can't- I have to- I guess I have to beat it once.
[28:33.40]Fuck.
[28:36.86]Fine, we'll do very, very hard.
[28:41.33]God damn it.
[28:42.17]I guess you have to beat it once.
[28:43.95]You have to beat it once on through.
[28:46.23]Alright, everybody, hold on.
[28:48.11]Go.
[28:48.41]We're gonna blow through this shit.
[28:54.75]Do we really have to do like the children's, like fourth grade stuff?
[28:58.56]Come on, go.
[29:02.26]It doesn't even matter.
[29:02.76]Only one person.
[29:03.50]We're just gonna go until he sneezes.
[29:07.59]Okay, go.
[29:11.25]I thought I could just change the difficulty.
[29:15.46]Now I'm, like, going too fast.
[29:16.58]What are these?
[29:17.36]Who's on the top?
[29:17.94]Who's on the bottom?
[29:20.10]Is it a hair thing, I think?
[29:21.34]It's a hair thing.
[29:22.18]Alright, everybody with the... Go.
[29:22.92]Everybody with this hair, go.
[29:29.60]When you play on, like, the third grade level, they make it really simple.
[29:39.80]Is there a Zoombinis, like, world record?
[29:41.93]That would be fucking hilarious if there was.
[29:43.73]Oh, here, down here.
[29:50.05]Don't worry, you guys already understand how it works.
[29:54.97]I actually know a guy who played this game drunk once.
[29:57.81]Well, it is a very, very good game, especially if you have younger children.
[30:03.08]If you have a little brother, play the Zoombinis.
[30:07.90]He'll lose his mind at the funny characters.
[30:15.14]Couldn't you make every character the same?
[30:16.34]I don't think you can.
[30:18.70]I think there's a limit to how many people you can actually have that look the same.
[30:21.94]Otherwise the game doesn't work.
[30:23.10]Because the whole game is about deducting things about your character.
[30:26.12]Splendid job!
[30:28.06]Let's go, keep going.
[30:29.32]You want me to play it drunk?
[30:33.77]What do you think the plan is?
[30:38.49]Do you guys have any idea how fucking gassy this made me?
[30:42.02]This made me burp like under my breath like 30 fucking times so far.
[30:47.58]Like, it hurt.
[30:48.30]Alright, same deal.
[30:56.76]Enchanting.
[30:57.72]All fucked up on brain food.
[31:06.31]Stop it, please.
[31:09.05]Okay, I think it's the keyboard's like dry now.
[31:10.55]Should be fine.
[31:14.51]Alright, well now I understand you guys go top left.
[31:17.05]It's about noses, right?
[31:20.41]Uh, so pink nose.
[31:23.33]Pink nose went this way, right?
[31:24.45]It changes every time.
[31:25.81]It's not usually, it's not the same thing.
[31:28.53]Sometimes it's eyes, sometimes it's nose, sometimes it's hair.
[31:32.73]This actually might be eyes this time.
[31:36.19]Kinda slow, ain't ya?
[31:37.61]I think it is.
[31:38.73]Let's test that theory.
[31:39.81]Okay, by me.
[31:40.69]It is.
[31:42.43]It's eyes.
[31:43.19]Okay.
[31:44.83]Little eyes.
[31:47.40]Whoa!
[31:48.48]Apparently not little eyes.
[31:49.58]Now this side.
[31:50.44]It's hair again.
[31:51.26]No, why not?
[31:53.64]Mm-hmm.
[31:54.16]Oh, fuck.
[31:54.68]Okay.
[31:56.48]You're safe.
[31:57.06]You're not safe that way.
[31:58.26]Come on.
[31:59.70]I'm so sorry.
[32:03.07]Are we going to beat this game like four times in a row to make sure we get... One of the chosen two.
[32:08.31]To make sure we get everything unlocked.
[32:10.84]Yeah, there we go.
[32:17.80]So this is the game, by the way, if you didn't know.
[32:19.42]This is the game that I won at the raffle.
[32:21.30]Remember I was talking about a game I won at a raffle?
[32:22.76]It's this one.
[32:26.11]Certainly.
[32:27.65]Go ahead, go ahead.
[32:29.37]I'm going to say this way.
[32:33.15]Certainly.
[32:34.87]And let's do the... Okay, by me.
[32:36.43]Certainly.
[32:37.03]The radishes can go this way.
[32:38.37]The path is closed.
[32:41.94]Does this game have loot boxes?
[32:45.70]Why would this game have loot boxes?
[32:47.18]Proceed.
[32:50.49]One of the chosen few.
[32:52.15]Now we're going to try to blow through easy as fast as we can.
[32:55.39]You did it.
[32:56.87]You've done quite well.
[32:59.13]How delightful.
[33:01.47]Is it going to be the whole stream?
[33:02.85]Absolutely.
[33:03.65]Alright, here we go.
[33:05.21]Let's make the pizza.
[33:05.99]Let's get it correct.
[33:12.43]Whatever you are.
[33:14.03]Make me a pizza.
[33:16.27]So if he doesn't like what you put out, for instance, we can do like cheese.
[33:20.42]Let's just try a cheese pizza.
[33:24.91]Spits out the pizza, you give it to him, and he eats it.
[33:27.37]And if he doesn't like it, if you have to add toppings, take toppings... Okay, he doesn't like cheese.
[33:34.42]You can't fuck up more than like three or four times in a row.
[33:37.52]And by three or four, I mean like 12, because we're playing on the fourth grade level.
[33:40.62]So he doesn't want cheese.
[33:43.96]Does he just want a sauce pizza?
[33:51.11]More toppings.
[33:52.15]Okay.
[33:53.39]So we're gonna go with, what, mushrooms?
[33:56.63]Who has pizza without cheese?
[33:57.88]Some people do that.
[33:58.60]Wait, okay, so he does like that.
[34:04.12]Holy shit, somebody gave $50.
[34:05.22]Hold on.
[34:06.78]I've been missing bits, by the way.
[34:08.16]I got, like, filled up on, like, chemicals.
[34:13.33]Some of that, thank you for the $50.
[34:16.09]I've been watching ads for about a month to thank you for all the streams and the hard work you do.
[34:20.23]I've been watching you for over five years now and you help me through a lot of tough times and I want to make sure you know that I appreciate all you do and that you are a huge inspiration to me.
[34:27.69]Well, geez, man, you're going to make me fucking cry.
[34:31.35]I don't mean this out of disrespect.
[34:32.55]I'm serious.
[34:33.00]Like, I drank, like, a bunch of fucking baking soda.
[34:36.68]I'm sorry.
[34:37.56]Like, I can't help it.
[34:39.98]Also wanted to remind you of the time in Source where you zapped an old guy in jail after he taught you... After he taught you to play Swindlestones.
[34:52.74]Love you, Jerma.
[34:53.24]Keep it up.
[34:53.52]Well, thank you, some of that.
[34:56.10]That ruined the moment.
[34:56.94]I'm really sorry.
[34:57.66]But, like, this is really coming up on me.
[35:03.08]brain fluid soda.
[35:04.78]Immersion ruined.
[35:07.84]No, that's incredibly kind of you.
[35:10.22]Thank you.
[35:13.06]It shocks me on a daily basis when people tell me that they've fucking been watching me for five years.
[35:16.82]Thank you so much, man.
[35:19.92]He liked that.
[35:22.74]And then right after that, Topac gave another $50 and said, PSA, brain fluid is a gateway drug.
[35:32.01]Most drug addicts have used brain fluid from as early as a baby.
[35:35.19]Firstly, you only take it when you're really ill.
[35:37.51]You taste the sweet syrup for the first time.
[35:39.23]It's like nothing you've ever tasted before.
[35:41.36]It soothes your pain, temporarily reduces the symptoms of your ailments, and still tastes so good.
[35:47.48]You're soon taking the maximum dosage, but your illness subsides and your mom tells you you don't need brain fluid anymore.
[35:56.06]What?
[35:57.48]Well, thank you for the 50 fucking dollars, Topek.
[36:02.54]I appreciate it.
[36:05.78]And it's brain fluid with two U's.
[36:09.05]I can make sure I have to say that, otherwise I'm going to get in a lot of trouble.
[36:13.51]I'm going to say it's this, but thank you so, so much, you guys.
[36:18.87]People showering me with fucking tons of money.
[36:22.26]Thank you.
[36:23.36]He doesn't like fucking peppers already.
[36:24.68]He wants...
[36:27.24]So he wants pineapple, but he doesn't want pepper.
[36:30.08]So he wants pineapple and pepperoni.
[36:36.72]What am I drinking?
[36:37.18]I'm drinking Downey's cider.
[36:39.76]There we go, we got it.
[36:41.66]So his pizza, he wants mushrooms, pineapple, and pepperoni.
[36:49.51]Got it.
[36:51.45]Game over.
[36:52.07]Logical drowning of the Zumbinis.
[37:00.07]Pineapple on pizza?
[37:00.93]Apparently he wants it.
[37:01.81]Alright, nobody died.
[37:04.44]The narrator is so funny in this game.
[37:06.82]He freaks out halfway through.
[37:22.46]Here's the first campfire.
[37:29.60]Hold on.
[37:30.93]What's this?
[37:32.49]A campsite with hot soup all ready to eat?
[37:36.97]Looks like a fine place for Zumbinis to relax.
[37:42.21]But when they're ready to move on, they'll need a group of 16 along the path.
[37:48.24]Mm-hmm.
[37:49.49]So you can store people here.
[37:51.87]Eventually.
[37:53.83]Mist bonfire.
[37:59.33]You can eventually have a bunch of people sleeping here.
[38:01.81]So if you lose people along the way, you can store them here.
[38:06.44]So we don't need to do this.
[38:07.16]We're going to go up.
[38:08.56]You can go up or down.
[38:09.24]Let's go up.
[38:09.74]Yeah, everybody gets their own little honeycomb.
[38:15.40]You can just stuff them in there.
[38:18.99]Zunbinis must have something in common with their neighbor to sit on Captain Cajun's Ferry.
[38:28.75]All of my Zunbinis.
[38:31.15]I think at most I had like 1,200 or like 1,100 or something Zunbinis on the island.
[38:37.33]Why were so many people begging for this game?
[38:39.19]Because it's a classic.
[38:40.41]It's a classic logic game.
[38:43.41]Now hurry yourselves up and find your seat.
[38:46.75]Again, only certain people can sit next to each other, so let's try to sit you here.
[38:50.73]Okay.
[38:50.91]No, you don't go there.
[38:51.75]Okay.
[38:51.95]So, what about... we got... I don't know what it is yet.
[39:00.32]Nope.
[39:10.99]They have to have something that connects them.
[39:13.19]So, eyes.
[39:14.99]Oh, he's dead.
[39:17.47]Okay, but we lost.
[39:18.66]No, we didn't.
[39:19.32]Good.
[39:19.70]Is he dead?
[39:20.02]No, okay.
[39:22.46]I thought he killed him.
[39:24.92]So, eyes.
[39:28.58]There you go.
[39:29.08]You got it.
[39:30.41]They have to have something in common with each other.
[39:33.09]So I'm going with eyes here until we can figure this out.
[39:35.31]So now we can go with nose.
[39:37.45]There you go.
[39:37.93]You got it.
[39:38.81]Nose.
[39:39.21]Okay.
[39:39.41]Yellow noses.
[39:41.09]Yellow noses.
[39:41.67]We can move them around.
[39:42.37]Don't worry.
[39:42.72]They can be moved.
[39:44.36]Hair.
[39:46.50]Hair.
[39:46.84]Just put them down.
[39:50.30]Okay.
[39:50.68]Hold on.
[39:50.98]We got hair again.
[39:51.72]Now we got red noses.
[39:53.86]Bingo.
[39:56.52]It's like I never went through the fucking second grade.
[40:06.09]I thought you said it was a children's game?
[40:07.25]It is a children's game.
[40:11.47]Thank you, a fine specimen for $30.
[40:15.74]It's a pizza get.
[40:16.82]Thank you so much.
[40:18.60]For the 30 fucking dollars.
[40:21.20]This is where it gets interesting, because I forget this whole fucking thing.
[40:24.08]I forget this whole thing.
[40:25.71]Alright, hold on.
[40:26.91]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[40:27.59]Okay, so these frogs go on a certain path.
[40:33.39]Shit.
[40:33.91]Okay.
[40:35.15]Color, flower, and lily pad shape.
[40:37.33]Two may be the keys that get them through.
[40:39.01]Feeling stuck?
[40:39.55]Don't worry, brave explorer.
[40:41.31]You have all the information you need to complete this challenge and get your zumbinis through.
[40:44.71]Take your time.
[40:45.31]Look for patterns.
[40:46.07]Oh, fuck off.
[40:49.47]So, let's see.
[40:51.57]Blue goes around.
[40:54.09]I think it's by color.
[40:55.91]Let's see what happens if you... Let's just put you here.
[41:02.19]Yep, so he goes across.
[41:04.57]I think this is just color for this one.
[41:10.54]Sometimes you have to slow down.
[41:15.62]Because he's just going down the line of color.
[41:17.52]So he'll get across.
[41:18.34]Can he jump back?
[41:20.72]He comes back.
[41:21.24]There he goes.
[41:23.58]Let's go ahead and put somebody on this one.
[41:25.44]Let's put somebody.
[41:26.30]Where does that connect?
[41:27.62]Red.
[41:28.11]Can red get all the way across?
[41:29.15]It can.
[41:30.63]From here.
[41:32.69]What about yellow?
[41:33.82]We've got yellow.
[41:34.62]Yellow can get across too.
[41:35.80]Go for it.
[41:39.08]What about shapes?
[41:42.22]X's.
[41:43.20]X, X, X. X. Does X go all the way across?
[41:48.65]It does.
[41:48.95]Alright, X. Let's put X down here.
[41:51.57]Somebody get on there.
[41:56.61]Fuck, did I already screw this up?
[41:57.65]No, I didn't.
[42:00.42]What about pink?
[42:04.10]This is going to take a while.
[42:09.21]What about blue?
[42:10.11]What about... How can only one person get on a frog at one time?
[42:15.51]Alright, so I guess we can just do it again.
[42:24.20]Where's the teal?
[42:25.56]Where's the teal?
[42:28.83]Alright, what about this lily pad?
[42:30.28]No, you can't go.
[42:31.24]You can only go... You can't go diagonally.
[42:33.38]You can only go up and down, left and right.
[42:35.94]Did somebody die?
[42:36.48]No, they didn't.
[42:39.40]I hate this one.
[42:39.88]We're going down next time.
[42:40.94]Fuck this one.
[42:41.44]This one sucks.
[42:44.71]Lily pad.
[42:50.77]Uh, there's no pink.
[42:52.33]There's no yellow.
[42:53.75]Oh, yellow is still here.
[42:57.05]What about this one?
[42:57.73]The weird folded napkin.
[43:01.01]Does a folded napkin work here?
[43:02.35]No.
[43:04.09]I'm going to lose people.
[43:07.67]There's no blue.
[43:08.43]Blue can't go anywhere.
[43:12.74]Full leaf clover?
[43:13.48]Flower, flower.
[43:16.88]Okay, this will work.
[43:17.46]Okay.
[43:25.24]Flower can go in the top row, but nobody else can.
[43:28.49]Unless Red.
[43:29.37]Red can go here, right?
[43:31.03]Yeah, I can get something.
[43:31.83]Another person on Red, come on.
[43:33.99]You can make it all the way across.
[43:36.99]There's no X's.
[43:41.56]High IQ.
[43:44.86]Look, we're gonna beat this whole game.
[43:46.60]Tonight.
[43:47.48]I'm gonna get shit-faced.
[43:49.30]And we're gonna beat very, very, very hard.
[43:53.51]This one goes flower.
[43:56.04]There, I think he can go down here.
[44:03.22]Uh... No, he can't.
[44:08.44]What about the lily pad shape?
[44:12.03]I think, yeah, he can go across there.
[44:13.73]Right here, right?
[44:14.79]I think that worked.
[44:15.31]Did that work?
[44:15.75]Am I gonna... Is he gonna die?
[44:16.87]Don't die.
[44:17.27]That's the lily pad shape.
[44:19.93]He can go down and across and up.
[44:21.39]Yeah, he can.
[44:25.52]Funny joke incoming.
[44:26.44]No, I already did the funny joke.
[44:31.21]I blew it like an hour ago.
[44:34.09]Not even.
[44:34.63]Like 25 minutes ago.
[44:38.23]This is rather boring.
[44:43.20]You know, you get what you signed up for.
[44:45.08]When people tell me they want me to play the logical journey of the Zoombinis, that's what we're going to do.
[44:54.50]Alright, we can do that again.
[44:55.26]So you do the same thing.
[44:58.70]There's got to be something else here.
[45:01.80]These table napkins, no, just get stuck there.
[45:04.74]No, nothing, no, nothing.
[45:06.78]Nobody can even move.
[45:07.58]No four-leaf clover, nothing to three-leaf clover.
[45:09.80]I guess these can do it, but where does it go?
[45:11.82]Here?
[45:13.60]Down, up, no.
[45:15.17]Cross.
[45:17.97]I think this is correct.
[45:22.74]I think this is correct.
[45:27.88]Fuck.
[45:28.56]No, get off.
[45:29.18]Get off.
[45:30.08]I wanted to do this one.
[45:32.58]Get off.
[45:33.60]How do I tell him to get off?
[45:35.35]Can I click him off?
[45:37.37]We lost one.
[45:38.91]Fucking goddammit.
[45:39.81]No, I didn't want to put- I wanted to put this one on there.
[46:01.62]Damn it.
[46:12.57]I could have saved two more.
[46:13.61]I know, but it doesn't matter.
[46:14.39]You have to have 16.
[46:15.95]Otherwise, you can't do the harder difficulty.
[46:18.13]This is... Alright, just wait a minute.
[46:22.29]I need to, like, remember how these games even worked in the first place.
[46:26.04]There's feet, eyes, hair, nose.
[46:27.82]Okay, let's put... Feet.
[46:36.69]I don't even know what the hell this wants me to do.
[46:38.69]I forget the whole thing.
[46:43.45]I didn't mean to do that.
[46:46.69]You have to have the same feet.
[46:49.81]Okay, we got these people.
[46:50.77]These guys get the same feet.
[46:54.42]Same eyes.
[46:57.40]Look, if you're going to keep doing that, you're going to give me a brain aneurysm.
[47:04.46]Okay, you need the same hair.
[47:08.57]These two have the same hair.
[47:12.37]Oh, my God.
[47:13.45]Stop it.
[47:16.70]Just sit there.
[47:17.38]Be good.
[47:18.88]Same nose.
[47:20.64]This is where it gets weird.
[47:21.68]So I need to move you here.
[47:25.50]You two here.
[47:26.10]We need to move the same eyes here.
[47:28.86]Here we go.
[47:29.93]No, we need to have a yellow nose here.
[47:34.65]uh shit okay uh you guys stand here for a second there's a lot of red noses so red nose let's move you over here let's get let's get the red noses out of here okay let's go with yellow nose here and then who's got you got you
[48:01.92]No.
[48:02.22]Okay, we need... Can you substitute this?
[48:04.74]No.
[48:05.58]You're like the odd man out here.
[48:11.42]Same shoes.
[48:14.43]We need to have the same eyes.
[48:16.35]What's the most common eye here?
[48:18.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:34.86]You guys have the same feet.
[48:38.65]So you... You two get the fuck out of here.
[48:42.17]You stand here.
[48:43.35]And you stand here.
[48:45.29]Now you stand over here.
[48:47.97]You get over here.
[48:49.65]And we got it.
[48:50.59]It's done.
[48:54.63]Move on.
[48:55.77]How am I still wet?
[49:01.17]I don't understand it.
[49:06.58]This is the second campfire.
[49:07.80]This is where the guy freaks up.
[49:09.00]Everybody stick around for this.
[49:11.52]I used to laugh at this all the time when I was in the 8th grade.
[49:15.02]Amazing indeed!
[49:17.90]Another relaxing campsite ready and waiting for Zumbinis!
[49:23.86]And they'll need their rest.
[49:26.20]The darkest, most dangerous part of the journey is yet to come!
[49:33.05]Ha ha ha!
[49:39.25]That was a lot funnier when I was like eight, but come on.
[49:44.72]Oh, uh, right.
[49:46.12]I have to have 16.
[49:46.76]So we have to store everybody.
[49:50.20]I can't, I cannot, I, the game is uncompletable.
[49:54.82]You need 16 people.
[49:57.53]So we need to make everybody go to bed here.
[49:59.13]This person can't move.
[50:01.71]What are you doing?
[50:07.21]Remember, if you don't have 16, it's okay.
[50:10.00]You can always come back.
[50:11.70]You can come back for more.
[50:15.36]So there are four people here.
[50:18.98]How are there four people here?
[50:20.50]Oh.
[50:21.95]Weird.
[50:23.07]Alright, so let's go back here.
[50:25.39]Let's go get some more Zumbinis.
[50:28.41]This time let's make a bunch.
[50:29.99]You gotta have equal parts.
[50:37.88]Let's start with this hair.
[50:41.74]We need glasses.
[50:43.24]We don't have enough Cyclopses.
[50:44.64]And this hair was very... Was not accounted for.
[50:47.42]Let's get like a few of these.
[50:53.53]That's too many guys with the fucking spinny... God damn it.
[50:56.17]Too many propellers.
[50:58.49]More springs.
[51:01.95]That's good.
[51:06.42]And... Maybe a couple more sprouts with the... glasses.
[51:12.86]Each Zimbini in this group must be unique.
[51:14.34]Try another combination.
[51:15.42]Okay, well, sorry.
[51:23.01]Need some more skaters.
[51:23.79]Okay, what have we got so far?
[51:31.23]Four.
[51:32.41]Eight.
[51:32.73]Okay.
[51:33.19]Too many Cyclopses?
[51:33.93]What are you talking about?
[51:34.67]Fuck!
[51:36.40]There really are too many Cyclopses.
[51:38.44]I thought I was being really good and making my- I was diversifying my portfolio of Zumbini purchases.
[51:47.13]Apparently not.
[51:52.21]That's good.
[51:52.93]Now, Cyclopses, we need glasses.
[51:55.41]Actual glasses.
[51:56.27]Eyeglasses.
[51:59.86]They have the same haircut.
[52:01.74]Fucking hell.
[52:03.34]It's okay.
[52:03.58]Okay.
[52:06.31]Oh, they all got the same shoes now.
[52:08.38]No pink shoes.
[52:09.04]More pink shoes?
[52:11.02]Oh, we got it.
[52:11.48]We got 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 8, 12, 16 Zumbinis!
[52:12.20]Too many pink.
[52:12.70]It's alright.
[52:14.24]We just have to get 16.
[52:18.74]We have to just get 16.
[52:19.58]It doesn't matter how many.
[52:34.40]We're gonna be fine.
[52:36.06]Everybody relax.
[52:39.90]Let's hope it's pink noses.
[52:45.38]I think it is.
[52:45.82]You guys didn't want me to have pink noses.
[52:50.70]Plenty of those.
[52:52.88]Oh, shit.
[52:53.50]No, it wasn't pink noses.
[52:59.13]So what the hell was it then?
[52:59.89]Eyes?
[53:03.24]Maybe the little beady eyes have to go this way.
[53:08.62]Yes.
[53:14.45]That's probably the only... That's probably the only thing.
[53:16.83]Get the fuck out of here.
[53:26.10]Calm down.
[53:28.60]Whoa.
[53:29.50]Alright, glass has got to go up.
[53:34.25]Why am I back at the bridge?
[53:35.03]Because this game is a roguelike.
[53:37.81]Yeah, you have to go back and do it all over again.
[53:48.54]It's the hair.
[53:49.16]What do you mean the hair?
[53:53.50]Well, what?
[53:54.88]Look, tell me the common denominator before.
[53:57.00]It was three beady eyes before the hair was even into play.
[54:00.48]This is a roguelike.
[54:14.39]What did we do to deserve this?
[54:17.79]They're back!
[54:20.23]Yummy!
[54:21.19]Fuck.
[54:24.13]Wrong way.
[54:25.67]Nice try.
[54:26.87]Did you say brain fluid works?
[54:29.19]It does.
[54:29.53]Proceed.
[54:33.34]Let's try hair.
[54:37.36]I think it's either hair... Well, it's either hair or eyes.
[54:41.41]You know, it's this... I cannot come to a disturbing factor.
[54:48.19]Now, let's see what's eyes.
[54:51.00]Was it eyes?
[54:51.88]Yes, it was.
[54:54.32]All Cyclopses, please.
[54:56.78]Move to the right.
[55:01.36]What about beady eyes?
[55:02.91]Beady eyes this way?
[55:05.85]Everyone's too similar.
[55:06.79]It's okay.
[55:07.23]Once we get to the campsite, we can change some people out.
[55:12.74]We can change out people.
[55:14.00]Everything's going to be fine.
[55:14.96]You'll do.
[55:18.78]Not all doors are open to you.
[55:21.90]Why do you have to make this one so stupid?
[55:24.06]Go ahead.
[55:24.90]Go ahead.
[55:26.45]It's all about the eyes.
[55:29.91]Yeah, you'll let them pass.
[55:31.03]You'll let them pass.
[55:33.85]Glasses, this way.
[55:38.85]Okay.
[55:40.39]Everybody with a pair of glasses.
[55:42.42]There's only one sleepy guy.
[55:46.38]Sleepy guy.
[55:46.94]Let's try sleepy guy.
[55:50.22]Sorry.
[55:55.75]God damn it.
[55:56.51]I'm gonna lose.
[55:57.87]This way.
[56:00.75]Once you start seeing rocks fall is when you know you're in trouble.
[56:03.75]Go ahead.
[56:04.57]Go ahead.
[56:07.38]Same deal.
[56:08.38]Eh.
[56:09.00]Maybe?
[56:10.38]Yes.
[56:10.80]Alright.
[56:12.20]Pizza party!
[56:14.66]Proceed!
[56:16.88]Ah, shit.
[56:17.22]I skipped it.
[56:21.30]I'm sorry.
[56:23.62]Pizza troll.
[56:26.40]Let's try just straight up cheese.
[56:30.82]Whatever you are, make me a pizza!
[56:35.86]It's easy.
[56:36.46]You don't want to load shit up too quickly with this guy.
[56:38.44]Eventually it gets harder.
[56:39.38]There's three people here.
[56:43.92]He doesn't want cheese again.
[56:45.55]Okay.
[56:47.95]Let's try it again.
[56:50.27]Same thing.
[56:50.65]Pineapple with no cheese.
[56:55.07]I used to get so hungry playing this.
[56:56.23]Is it the same one?
[57:02.15]This game teaches you how to judge people based on how they look.
[57:05.31]No, it doesn't!
[57:05.99]This game says... That there's certain... Look, you know what?
[57:17.18]This game says that there's certain people... That are assholes.
[57:21.48]That will talk about and discriminate the way that you look.
[57:25.64]Not you.
[57:28.59]This game's about be who the fuck you want to be.
[57:31.12]And deal with the assholes that don't agree.
[57:33.19]Did he say yuck?
[57:42.67]I missed that.
[57:43.59]Did he say yuck?
[57:53.46]Was that a yay or a nay?
[57:56.82]I was busy not paying attention.
[57:58.48]Okay, let's do this.
[58:01.10]I'm gonna assume this is probably it.
[58:04.70]There it is.
[58:05.26]I love this animation.
[58:17.20]I want that as a gif for my forum avatar.
[58:20.06]Oh my goodness.
[58:20.97]Alright, we're at the camp.
[58:23.91]Alright, we're at the camp.
[58:27.35]Uh, Tender Tacos.
[58:30.51]XTenderTacos just gave 100 Zumbanis.
[58:36.00]I'd watch every single drama stream live for 13 months straight before September when I had to temporarily cut a lot of hobbies out of my life.
[58:44.72]I've been slowly catching up since then.
[58:46.87]Almost done with the Shadow of War VODs.
[58:48.97]And I'll get there eventually, but tonight I just want to catch one live.
[58:52.35]And so Sally can wait.
[58:54.97]She knows it's too late as we're walking on by.
[58:57.05]Her soul slides away.
[58:59.09]But don't look back in anger.
[59:00.55]I heard you say.
[59:07.40]I'm typing that in right now.
[59:09.32]I'm sick of not knowing what song it is.
[59:12.74]I'm typing that word for word in right now.
[59:36.70]Guys?
[59:37.86]My keyboard doesn't work.
[60:08.12]Okay.
[60:13.87]God fucking dammit.
[60:18.42]Thank god I don't need to use a keyboard for this game.
[60:22.18]Thank fucking god.
[60:43.26]Hold on, I gotta unplug this fucking thing.
[60:51.14]Before it like fries my motherboard.
[60:53.68]How am I gonna do anything else?
[60:55.33]Why?
[60:56.19]Fucking, this stupid fucking like children's science joke.
[61:03.61]Where even is it plugged in?
[61:06.97]What, everyone's making fun of the crypto?
[61:09.13]Everyone's making fun of my cryptocurrency?
[61:15.30]But you saw my search history.
[61:16.72]I was looking up the Bitcoins.
[61:18.64]I was curious about the Bitcoins.
[61:21.48]It's all over the news.
[61:22.76]It's all over NBC.
[61:23.72]I need to know what the fuck is going on.
[61:24.96]I have to keep up.
[61:25.60]I'm a hip person.
[61:26.32]I'm a hip man.
[61:32.06]Where is this even plugged in?
[61:33.18]I don't even know where it's plugged in.
[61:47.80]Informed?
[61:48.36]I am informed!
[61:49.64]I'm just not that informed.
[61:53.83]What does this one say?
[62:00.81]This one just says China on it.
[62:03.67]I'm not kidding.
[62:04.45]There's a cord plugged into the back of my computer that says China.
[62:08.48]If I unplug this, is a whole country going to disappear?
[62:11.18]I don't understand.
[62:16.62]What is this?
[62:20.38]There it is.
[62:32.81]Alright.
[62:34.05]How am I going to do anything?
[62:35.69]Only mouse.
[62:37.47]Give me a break.
[62:48.06]Okay.
[62:48.50]I need another drink.
[62:49.36]It's a fucking keyboard, man.
[62:51.70]I swear to God.
[62:52.34]I'm not a dumb motherfucker.
[62:55.66]I could have just easily had pushed this in.
[63:01.30]Look, if you guys have been keeping up with the crypto markets, it's insanity.
[63:09.66]I do.
[63:10.08]I do.
[63:10.46]I do.
[63:10.68]I like to keep up with it.
[63:11.61]It's interesting to me.
[63:13.43]We all get to have our hobbies.
[63:14.73]I think that like Bitcoin and crypto is really interesting.
[63:18.59]Let me have a hobby.
[63:19.79]Let me just have a fucking hobby.
[63:26.05]Campsite with hot soup all ready to eat.
[63:29.80]Grape and sandwich.
[63:30.60]Looks like a fine place for Zumbinis to relax.
[63:35.60]But when they're ready to move on, they'll need a group of 16 along the path.
[63:45.73]No hobbies for you.
[63:46.89]Hold, hold, hold.
[63:48.51]Alright, let's go down this time.
[63:54.56]Because we went up last time.
[63:56.48]Everyone's yelling at me.
[63:59.88]I know, I'm trying to play.
[64:01.62]I just broke a second keyboard in like two months.
[64:04.68]So that's why we haven't been playing the game.
[64:06.50]I'm sorry we haven't been playing.
[64:08.07]Same exact issue as well.
[64:16.29]Alright, I know this one.
[64:18.20]Here's the other group.
[64:20.36]I forget what this one does.
[64:27.38]Same deal.
[64:28.15]They come down.
[64:30.61]Can this guy go through?
[64:33.37]Oh yeah, you have to match.
[64:34.51]You have to match them.
[64:42.68]Okay, so hold on.
[64:43.38]Let me get this straight.
[64:45.71]Everybody here connotates to somebody down here.
[64:51.25]Based on what they have for clothes.
[64:54.91]And noses.
[64:56.48]I don't know how... I forget what I'm supposed to do here.
[65:01.32]Your keyboard is fine.
[65:02.18]Click the search bar.
[65:03.24]I was clicking that search bar.
[65:04.48]You saw the little ding-dong.
[65:16.43]It's the ones in the beehive.
[65:17.55]Yeah.
[65:17.77]Okay.
[65:18.03]Okay.
[65:18.21]So they had the three come off the beehive attacks everybody.
[65:20.43]Okay.
[65:20.65]I remember.
[65:21.71]So we've got, so that is, okay.
[65:25.38]Bandana is the sprout.
[65:28.22]So we got sprout.
[65:29.14]How many sprouts do we have?
[65:30.50]They have one, two, three.
[65:32.62]So do I. So one, two, three.
[65:38.82]Okay.
[65:39.14]So nose, obviously the blue nose is the red nose.
[65:45.21]So let's go with... Let's go with this guy.
[65:54.35]Fuck.
[65:56.46]That wasn't correct.
[65:59.02]Shit.
[65:59.38]Okay, so hold on.
[66:00.16]So that means... That's blue.
[66:04.30]And that's bandana.
[66:07.43]So it's this guy.
[66:17.51]Still another sprout.
[66:18.43]So this guy, it has to be one of these two.
[66:22.25]So the guy... What is even happening?
[66:34.84]You have to match up.
[66:36.34]Everybody here is everybody here.
[66:37.62]It's a mirror match.
[66:38.36]Alright, what was this guy?
[66:41.60]We need a propeller.
[66:44.65]And we need a pink nose propeller.
[66:47.95]Got it!
[66:48.39]Winner!
[66:55.69]And we all get to live.
[66:58.94]Okay, you gotta knock all the guys- the beehive has to knock out.
[67:04.14]Still got 16.
[67:12.15]I'm not even close to being drunk.
[67:13.89]This has got to change immediately.
[67:16.92]Ulla, the forest's foremost, and perhaps only, band leader is about to begin rehearsals.
[67:24.84]She'll be closing the hotel for the night, so scamper into a room.
[67:29.06]I think this one's timed.
[67:33.98]Guests?
[67:36.35]Ah, guests.
[67:38.29]I'll be right down.
[67:40.15]Make yourselves cozy.
[67:45.51]You're just in time for tomorrow's concerto!
[67:50.79]Help yourselves to a room.
[67:53.57]I got rehearsal.
[67:54.76]Go ahead.
[67:55.68]Find yourselves a room.
[67:58.76]So everybody has to- everyone shares a bedroom.
[68:01.54]It's really fucked up.
[68:02.36]Alright, so can- So I think- Can we do this by hair or- oh god dammit, it's timed.
[68:11.03]Fuck at least we have so many people with big hair Sorry we got how much we got enough room for everybody.
[68:24.92]I think so I'm pretty sure we have enough room because I made way too many of the same people pink noses We do all pink noses in here
[68:36.00]Oh, shit in my face.
[68:37.20]What?
[68:37.46]What happened?
[68:37.80]God damn it.
[68:39.28]I don't understand.
[68:40.46]What?
[68:42.61]Get in there.
[68:43.39]It has to be here.
[68:44.79]Yeah, we got like 30 seconds.
[68:57.43]That's way too many people for one.
[68:58.89]We're essentially stuffing people as acorns into the tree.
[69:01.95]You get your own room.
[69:03.50]Alright, you two, you guys are the glasses, you guys are the smart ones, you get your own rooms.
[69:08.48]Oh, just look at the time.
[69:10.21]Gotta split.
[69:11.77]See you in the morning.
[69:15.71]Got it.
[69:17.79]Is that a Minecraft door sound?
[69:18.97]It's probably just a stuck door sound.
[69:22.02]A zoner, or zoner, thanks for the ten bucks.
[69:24.56]My first Jerma stream and you're playing fucking Zumbini, it's incredible.
[69:29.16]It's an incredible game.
[69:31.42]Thank you, Zahner.
[69:32.44]Official Ponystar, thanks for the $1.
[69:35.24]So one of those Jerma... I can't even pronounce this word.
[69:39.83]Daikatanas?
[69:40.55]One of the Daikatanas have been made.
[69:42.59]I don't even know.
[69:43.97]But thanks for the $1, Official Ponystar.
[69:49.33]Zahner, again, thanks for the $1.
[69:51.13]So $11 total there.
[69:53.21]Prismic, thanks for the $1.
[69:54.45]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching ads for about 10 years now to finally get enough bits.
[69:58.22]But I love your streams, BB.
[70:00.46]Thank you, Prismic.
[70:02.82]So this one is, you have to, I forget.
[70:05.98]It's about getting the right shape and color.
[70:09.61]So if we do like red and triangle, and we shoot it.
[70:14.33]Okay, red is the column.
[70:19.35]Triangle is probably the row.
[70:20.35]So let's go with red.
[70:21.69]Let's try like blue square.
[70:26.98]Okay, blue is definitely the column squares here.
[70:29.94]So we're gonna do square, yellow.
[70:33.96]No, square, alright.
[70:36.49]Well, square is the row.
[70:39.91]So we need another color here.
[70:41.09]No, we need red, because red is the horizontal line.
[70:46.01]I know what I'm doing.
[70:51.01]Let's go with pink.
[70:56.30]Load them all up.
[70:56.94]This is how much juice I have left.
[71:01.96]So I need pink.
[71:02.94]I'm going to say star.
[71:05.46]Pink star.
[71:07.24]Will get me three.
[71:10.08]How does this even work?
[71:10.80]You'll understand once this happens.
[71:12.98]So remember, pink is the row.
[71:16.99]The color is the row.
[71:17.79]The shape is the column.
[71:19.87]So that means I need a star.
[71:21.13]A yellow star.
[71:22.71]I'm going to take it right here.
[71:26.04]Paint the wall with their blood.
[71:32.13]So I still don't know what this is.
[71:33.23]Let's go with circle.
[71:35.85]And blue.
[71:36.11]Circle pink.
[71:39.97]And circle green.
[71:42.99]It's almost like this fucking game was made for adults.
[71:52.62]Just wait till we play this on hard.
[71:54.66]This gets way more complicated.
[72:00.83]Settle down.
[72:03.79]Now we need red diamond.
[72:08.89]Yeah, it's red diamond.
[72:16.43]You think I ran out of games to play?
[72:18.18]No, look!
[72:19.46]I'm gonna say this again.
[72:21.44]There was a bunch of people that told me, we want to watch you play Zoombinis.
[72:26.41]And I was like, alright, fine.
[72:28.01]If that's what the people want, then that's what they're going to get.
[72:31.25]It was on, like, people made, like, polls.
[72:33.51]I had to personal message me.
[72:34.97]I got, like, three personal messages.
[72:37.77]I got, like, three or four personal messages about this.
[72:43.63]Here we go.
[72:48.76]One of the last bonfires.
[72:55.18]So let's change it up a little.
[72:57.74]Let's get some of these guys.
[72:59.96]One of you.
[73:00.66]I need some more wheels.
[73:01.80]Some more wheels.
[73:03.08]Keep the glasses.
[73:03.92]Let's lose a cyclops or two.
[73:05.48]Lose one of these springboard cyclopses and add a beanie wheel.
[73:26.55]I need more springboards.
[73:30.77]I only have one springboard.
[73:35.99]Too many glasses.
[73:39.60]Sleepy person.
[73:41.36]Let's go for it.
[73:45.80]This game is actually on Steam.
[73:48.78]You can go buy it right now.
[73:49.82]And it works on modern operating systems.
[73:54.73]Strange carvings left by ancient peoples are everywhere.
[74:02.17]Alright, so this one is about blue, pink, I don't remember.
[74:08.95]It's obviously something about noses.
[74:11.77]Blue.
[74:14.71]So all noses have to go first.
[74:16.41]So blue, blue, blue, any more blue noses?
[74:20.20]Pink?
[74:23.42]Pink.
[74:24.45]Good thing we have a lot of pink.
[74:26.07]Otherwise this would have been difficult.
[74:30.01]Green.
[74:35.45]Just wait.
[74:36.63]We're in the very, very beginning of the game.
[74:40.90]That person just said auto.
[74:43.88]And then red.
[74:44.20]I think we made it.
[74:54.23]There's one more, I think, on the top row here.
[75:01.36]Crystal filter.
[75:02.92]Hey, Zoner, thanks for the 10 bucks again.
[75:06.24]Show DMs.
[75:07.36]I'm not going to show you my DMs.
[75:13.23]That's like private, personal DMs.
[75:15.05]I'm not going to show them, do you?
[75:22.83]Show DMs.
[75:24.12]No.
[75:25.06]Absolutely not.
[75:26.04]We can get off this right now.
[75:27.04]Get off this right now.
[75:28.20]Get off of this right now.
[75:29.00]You want me to show you my, like, fucking phone?
[75:31.98]Get out of here.
[75:32.96]Knock it off.
[75:33.78]Hey.
[75:34.62]Knock it off.
[75:38.28]OG POTUS.
[75:39.24]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[75:41.61]Someday you will find me.
[75:43.21]Company to landslide in a champagne supernova in the sky.
[75:46.61]Sour.
[75:47.79]Sour plus.
[75:48.75]Sour plus.
[75:49.97]Sour please.
[75:50.31]Sour please.
[75:52.28]I know that's Wonderwall, I know.
[75:53.78]Wait, hold on.
[75:57.58]I'm gonna be the one that saves me.
[76:00.70]And I found all the... You're my wonderful... Yeah, it's Waterfall.
[76:06.18]No, not Waterfall.
[76:07.10]It's not... What is it?
[76:07.88]TLC?
[76:09.96]Thank you, OG Potus.
[76:10.80]Thank you, ThatFruity53Dollars.
[76:12.36]Hey, Jeremy, I just wanted to say thanks.
[76:14.20]You and your vids got me through a rough patch in my life during winter 2015.
[76:19.02]Heart.
[76:19.40]Also, I'm turning 21 soon.
[76:20.30]I wanted to ask you for tips on dealing with male pattern baldness.
[76:25.99]Well, I'm not bald yet.
[76:28.61]Actually, I do have tips for you if you've seen some male pattern baldness.
[76:33.13]I actually do.
[76:35.39]Fish.
[76:35.87]You want to eat more fish?
[76:37.71]That means taking some good fatty salmon.
[76:39.47]That means eating some tuna.
[76:41.83]Taking some sushi.
[76:43.53]You want to add some good fatty fish into your life.
[76:47.31]If you really want to do a little bit of more research on it, you can maybe take in some saw palmetto.
[76:51.97]Don't take in too much.
[76:52.83]Saw palmetto is fucking not that great for you if you're taking a lot of it.
[76:55.41]Just a little amount.
[76:55.95]Just a tiny amount.
[76:58.29]Drink more tea.
[76:59.01]Green tea.
[77:01.53]Serious.
[77:01.99]What am I supposed to do here?
[77:03.69]It's a mirror.
[77:05.37]It's like I said, I think you put two people here or something.
[77:12.10]Some way to know.
[77:12.52]You're looking for mirrors.
[77:13.28]Alright, so... Can I pull you off?
[77:15.67]Let me just look.
[77:16.07]Okay, so I need a guy on a bike with glasses.
[77:20.11]We don't got that.
[77:21.71]Do we have a guy with a spring?
[77:26.61]Where are you?
[77:27.16]I know that you're here somewhere.
[77:28.84]There you are.
[77:29.22]Okay.
[77:32.28]Yeah, there you are.
[77:33.12]How come it's not... Come on.
[77:40.81]Flip the switch, man.
[77:41.63]Let's go.
[77:44.58]Oh, there.
[77:50.42]I actually have to drag it down.
[77:51.58]Okay.
[77:52.22]Flip it.
[77:52.60]This is gonna take a while.
[77:54.72]Alright, who else?
[78:01.75]Any more?
[78:02.17]Alright.
[78:09.27]Um...
[78:12.97]Look for noses first, or hair.
[78:15.23]Red.
[78:17.51]Fuck, this is gonna take me like three months.
[78:21.66]I'm gonna be here for a month, or at least one fucking day.
[78:30.08]It's all about the eyes.
[78:31.88]Fuck.
[78:39.79]No, not that one.
[78:43.37]Merge them?
[78:43.95]What do you mean merge them?
[78:50.77]No, nobody over there.
[78:55.44]Is there a guy with glasses that has... No.
[79:00.22]It's two... Three Cyclopses.
[79:02.72]There we go.
[79:14.86]Let's do it again.
[79:15.42]Alright, uh, we got beady eyes, beady eyes.
[79:19.76]Beady eyes and, and flat top.
[79:22.10]Nope.
[79:23.62]Sneakers and ponytail.
[79:26.00]There we go.
[79:26.48]Nope, but you don't have glasses.
[79:28.96]Sneakers, but no.
[79:29.72]Uh, spinny doodle and glasses.
[79:32.86]Nope, we don't got that.
[79:33.92]Uh, what about, uh, what about, yeah, we got it.
[79:35.80]Bingo, right here.
[79:42.51]Thanks for the tips, Jeremy.
[79:43.75]That fruity with one dollar.
[79:44.79]Us balding men have to stick together.
[79:46.27]I'll definitely be eating more raw fish and chewing green tea leaves.
[79:49.49]No, I said drink tea.
[79:50.69]Don't eat tea leaves.
[79:51.95]I gotta speak this up.
[79:55.15]Come on.
[79:55.33]Right here.
[80:07.32]I'm not bald.
[80:08.96]I'm not even close to being bald.
[80:10.36]It's gonna take me ten more years to be bald.
[80:12.78]Alright, we're looking for, uh, no more springs.
[80:17.73]No more springs.
[80:18.11]Don't even look at springs.
[80:18.75]We don't have any springs.
[80:20.15]Spinny doodles.
[80:21.29]Propellers.
[80:23.03]Propellers, green nose.
[80:24.65]No, we got no propellers and green noses.
[80:28.85]Nope, right here.
[80:36.44]Brain fluid causes baldness.
[80:40.26]Yeah, you know what else causes baldness?
[80:42.95]Oh, I'm not gonna say it.
[80:43.65]Never mind.
[80:45.03]Don't do that anymore.
[80:45.97]That causes baldness.
[80:52.71]What am I doing?
[80:53.37]Okay.
[80:53.83]Springs.
[80:54.19]No more springs.
[80:54.71]Don't even look at them.
[80:55.89]Propellers.
[80:56.37]We have... What about sad eyes?
[81:01.38]Say it!
[81:02.50]I'm not gonna say it.
[81:03.12]There we go, right here.
[81:09.84]Listen chat don't make fun of bald my bald head.
[81:13.31]I don't have a bald fucking head Where where do you see a bald head?
[81:23.94]There might be a little bit of lightness and receding here but not bald I'm not bald not even close How dare you even make an assumption like that that I have a bald fucking head
[81:36.30]Right there.
[81:36.88]I understand.
[81:37.52]I get it.
[81:37.98]I know.
[81:38.38]I'm fucking older.
[81:39.38]I am older.
[81:40.54]That's what happens when you get older.
[81:42.60]You have to start shaving.
[81:44.72]You start growing hair on your chest.
[81:48.03]You know, your, like, lips and, like, chin and everything.
[81:50.01]You gotta use this.
[81:50.59]You gotta use a shaving product.
[81:52.95]It's a wig.
[81:53.45]You wanna prove it?
[81:55.95]Fine, I'll prove that it's not a wig.
[81:57.67]No, I got fucking just dirty, like, powdered baking soda flavoring in my hair now.
[82:03.60]God damn it.
[82:07.21]Forget it.
[82:07.71]It's not a wig.
[82:14.76]Please.
[82:15.08]Alright, glasses.
[82:17.70]We got glasses and... No, not this guy.
[82:25.68]No propellants here.
[82:26.38]We got wheels.
[82:28.04]Wheels and sunglasses.
[82:31.12]We got sneakers and... Here we go.
[82:38.16]My hair in the oven.
[82:40.14]I gotta put my fucking hair in an oven.
[82:44.04]Now, eat more fish.
[82:46.18]Fish is so good for you.
[82:47.59]And eat it right.
[82:49.67]And I'm not talking about, like, Gorton's Fisherman.
[82:53.59]Fish sticks and shit.
[82:54.75]No, go get, like, a good piece of fucking king salmon.
[82:59.27]And grill it for, like, three minutes aside.
[83:01.73]Let it sit.
[83:02.33]Let the meat rest.
[83:03.31]And then eat it.
[83:08.28]Who else is here?
[83:12.86]Bald stream.
[83:14.38]God.
[83:14.70]What are we looking for here?
[83:18.97]This guy.
[83:20.67]Not quite.
[83:21.31]Fuck.
[83:22.17]There we go.
[83:28.55]I gotta speed this up.
[83:31.45]You guys know how expensive toupees and wigs are?
[83:33.65]A toupee is like $900.
[83:34.61]You think I'm going to spend $900 on a toupee?
[83:38.25]Crazy.
[83:45.68]How do I know?
[83:52.44]How do I know?
[83:54.96]I know because I remember Jonathan Alexander talking about it.
[84:00.57]Oh, it's like The Tonight Show in 1998.
[84:02.13]He's like, you know, Jerry, it's really expensive.
[84:07.64]He's talking to fucking David Letterman, whatever his name is.
[84:19.86]What?
[84:20.24]My fucking goddamn keyboard.
[84:22.42]Fuck this.
[84:22.94]I just...
[84:27.41]We'll be out of here soon, then we can do the next difficulty.
[84:29.95]This is what you're trying to unlock all the difficulties What the fuck am I doing?
[84:34.11]Jason?
[84:36.85]What's his name?
[84:53.09]Jason Alexander.
[84:55.09]What did I say?
[84:55.61]Jonathan Alexander?
[84:57.63]Whatever his name is.
[84:58.36]You know who I'm talking about.
[85:00.18]Green noses.
[85:00.92]We don't have any green noses here.
[85:03.46]Pink or red?
[85:05.12]Pink nose?
[85:06.50]This is where it gets way easier now.
[85:17.72]We got green.
[85:18.64]We got some green noses here.
[85:20.04]Here we is.
[85:21.22]So easy.
[85:22.42]We're gonna get all 16.
[85:23.46]I'm talking about George Costanza, yeah.
[85:36.73]Old, bald, and short.
[85:41.01]Why you guys have... Why are you so mean?
[85:43.59]What did I do to deserve this meanness?
[85:47.96]I'm doing a flawless run of the Zoombinis right now.
[85:59.75]Danny DeVito.
[86:00.45]Alright, everyone's done.
[86:03.11]We win.
[86:10.98]I never played Minecraft.
[86:15.24]The Bubble Wonder Abyss.
[86:18.41]Yeah, this is where it gets tricky.
[86:27.19]Because if you have this type of shoe, you go down here.
[86:30.68]The goal is to get everyone over here.
[86:32.52]So if I put somebody here, they're going to go up.
[86:35.66]When they hit an arrow, they go that direction.
[86:37.28]So down...
[86:38.74]So if you have regular shoes on, go this way.
[86:45.14]Right?
[86:45.34]If you don't have regular shoes on, you're going to go into the black hole.
[86:51.40]So if you have a pink nose, you go that way.
[86:54.93]If you have a green nose, you keep going across.
[87:01.03]Okay, I've got to fucking sit here for a second.
[87:04.35]Hold on.
[87:08.43]This is gonna switch so that means I have to do a pink nose We got we got a anybody here a pink nose.
[87:14.15]Oh So it's got to go green nose Because it's gonna switch and then we got to do pink nose See so now do a pink nose over here make sure it's not the shoes Green nose Pink nose

[88:03.19]This guy's a pink nose.
[88:03.95]Make sure he goes this way now Yes
[88:11.32]Everybody else can go... If you don't have these shoes, you can go up.
[88:17.30]So it don't matter.
[88:17.88]Anybody that doesn't have those shoes can go this way.
[88:24.57]Right?
[88:25.81]Yes.
[88:26.07]No green noses this way.
[88:27.33]We got all 16 across.
[88:41.22]Now we can do the harder difficulty.
[88:45.47]Thank you very much.
[88:46.21]At least I did not fuck that up.
[88:52.21]Wait, the chat was telling me to do that differently.
[88:54.25]What?
[88:54.83]I did it right.
[88:56.75]Don't tell me to do that another way.
[88:57.93]That would have been completely wrong.
[89:03.18]We've completed one run of Zumbinis.
[89:06.50]You just have to do like a hundred more of these.
[89:14.17]All 16.
[89:14.51]Alright, we've got 16 people into Zumbiniville.
[89:19.59]Here it comes.
[89:46.20]I lead them all to Zumbinieville.
[89:50.00]Nine, ten.
[89:50.88]Here they are.
[89:53.08]Here's everybody.
[89:53.78]They got a house now.
[89:55.91]This schoolhouse salutes the Zumbinies who did not lag in Lion's Lair, solved the secrets of the Mirror Machine, and flew above Bubble Wonder Abyss.
[90:02.55]When the traveling was not so easy.
[90:04.79]We got our first house.
[90:08.62]And we unlocked this too.
[90:11.54]This clock tower was constructed for the Zumbinies who got through these.
[90:17.96]We unlock buildings, and once you get like a hundred Zumbinis, you get like, you get the guy's bank account.
[90:24.54]Alright, so.
[90:28.54]Beautiful.
[90:28.90]Let's go back, and now we can do the journey.
[90:33.61]We start back here.
[90:34.51]So now how do we make it harder?
[90:47.15]Now how do you make the game harder?
[90:55.32]It's automatic.
[90:58.50]So wait, is this going to be on oh so hard now?
[91:01.58]Because I can go practice and click on these.
[91:09.19]But the journey, you have to keep going.
[91:12.13]It gets harder as you play.
[91:15.52]We gotta ship 400 Zimini's.
[91:25.88]I have to do practice mode so it gets it.
[91:28.58]Is this gonna be yellow now or is it still gonna be green?
[91:37.61]Just gotta keep going.
[91:38.61]New game plus.
[91:43.19]The options.
[91:44.03]No, there's no options menu for this.
[91:48.50]It's just adaptive gameplay.
[91:49.83]Let's try it.
[91:50.31]Let's see what happens.
[91:53.81]They'll give us a good crew.
[91:59.21]Get them all out there.
[91:59.99]Playing in Spanish.
[92:08.03]Okay, let's see.
[92:10.37]Look any different?
[92:19.89]You have to complete a path set of three puzzles three times perfectly to up its difficulty.
[92:28.43]There's so many green hats.
[92:36.11]It didn't get harder because you didn't do well enough.
[92:37.82]I took all 16 people across.
[92:39.36]God damn it.
[92:41.76]Is it hats?
[92:48.64]Okay, let's try hats down here.
[92:56.12]Look, you want me to make it harder?
[92:57.00]You want me to actually make it harder?
[92:58.52]No, look, we're going to do it right.
[93:03.86]I'm going to beat this three times.
[93:05.04]And then we're going to do it on very hard.
[93:07.27]It's not going to take that long.
[93:11.19]I told you that.
[93:11.99]I have to have... Here's how we're going to play this.
[93:15.97]I have to have a full drink every single time I complete something here.
[93:25.27]But I don't want to do practice mode.
[93:33.78]I'm going to make it harder.
[93:34.62]I'm going to make it harder on myself.
[93:39.94]You have to beat it nine times to get very hard.
[93:42.48]Well, we've already beat it once.
[93:44.50]How long has it taken us?
[93:46.53]An hour and a half.
[93:47.51]No, but that's what I was like drinking potions in the first fucking hour of the stream.
[93:51.18]So that's not even true.
[93:53.44]I'll get through this real quickly.
[94:03.20]Take a drink every time I break a keyboard.
[94:06.70]We're already done with the first level.
[94:13.24]First level's done.
[94:20.72]No, I'm gonna get I'm gonna get my time out of this these stone gods have their rules We've got visitors every time you're bald Fine you guys want to see how hard no I'm beating this again.
[94:41.91]Just wait a minute.
[94:42.47]I'm getting a drink.
[94:43.71]Hold on Right back
[95:19.34]Thank you.
[97:21.48]I'm not even kidding.
[97:24.00]It smells... It smells like fruity pebbles in this room.
[97:30.70]I don't know what's in those packets besides the brain fluid.
[97:36.03]Are we good?
[97:36.37]Yeah, we're good.
[97:36.87]I swear to God, I'm going to get fucking... I'm going to have to hire a professional cleaner to come in here and take care of this room.
[97:50.09]They're gonna get down here and be like, what do you do down here?
[97:54.82]Nothing.
[98:02.06]We're gonna make this real quick.
[98:04.44]Is it an eyes thing?
[98:05.62]A nose thing?
[98:07.61]Get over there.
[98:08.07]Alright, no.
[98:15.06]Away you go.
[98:16.60]We gotta take a drink every time a Zumbini dies?
[98:18.24]Well, don't worry.
[98:18.88]None of them are gonna die.
[98:20.66]Absolutely zero.
[98:23.96]Don't be shy.
[98:24.90]Okay, it's pink noses this way.
[98:30.30]I got bits to read, too.
[98:31.36]Hold on.
[98:31.90]We'll make this quick.
[98:34.00]We'll make this level quick while I read this.

[99:52.89]Alex Jones really does have like a BA voice.
[99:54.35]He really does.
[99:56.23]I'm not paying attention.
[99:59.40]I'm animated.
[100:00.68]I'm full of blood.
[100:02.06]And I'm alive.
[100:03.02]I eat meat.
[100:04.32]I have children.
[100:05.30]I have sex with my wife.

[100:17.70]He's like fucking Alex Jones, dude.
[100:20.82]Say hi to Arno.
[100:22.94]And so our brave travelers continue on through this dusty wasteland until they meet Arno, the almost omnivorous, one very hungry pizza troll.
[100:35.06]Alright, let's get the pizza right.
[100:41.26]Get it right the first time.
[100:42.18]Huh.
[100:45.88]Whatever you are.
[100:47.40]Make me a pizza!
[100:48.66]I can't wait till you guys see the other characters.
[100:50.22]They're so much cooler.
[100:51.92]Alright, just fucking jalapeño.
[100:57.13]Anyways, there were more bits to read.

[101:30.58]I felt like my poem was ignored.
[101:31.92]I do.
[101:33.10]If I miss them, I catch them at the end of the stream.
[101:37.00]But I get like really, I lose track of where I am.
[101:39.98]But thank you.
[101:42.48]Uh, did you know that everybody bullies you on stream because they find you attractive?
[101:46.60]Official Ponystar.
[101:47.56]Thanks for the $2.50.
[101:48.12]I don't know.
[101:50.59]Is that true?
[101:51.31]I have no idea.
[101:53.45]Zoner, again, thanks for the $1.
[101:55.09]Not sorry, $1.
[101:56.87]$10 again.
[101:58.23]Jerma, don't listen to those bullies talking about that old hairline.
[102:01.59]Take my $30 and go get Biotopic hair regrowth treatment.
[102:04.99]The best product at the best price.
[102:07.27]I'm not going to do hair regrowth treatments.
[102:11.93]It's not gonna happen.
[102:13.01]And I'll get to the other bits at the end of the stream.
[102:15.67]Thank you, though, everybody.
[102:16.57]You guys are fucking incredible.
[102:18.33]Spoiling the shit out of me.
[102:23.12]Fucking hair regrowth treatments.
[102:24.50]No.
[102:26.44]It's not natural.
[102:27.12]Alright, he did want that.
[102:29.46]Alright, so let's go with this.
[102:34.78]Just be healthy.
[102:38.47]Just be healthy.
[102:39.31]Lower your stress.
[102:40.07]You know stress...
[102:42.42]Stress causes so many problems for you.
[102:46.23]What do I do about my bald head?
[102:48.85]Lower the stress levels.
[102:50.33]It's cortisol.
[102:51.19]It's your cortisol levels go higher.
[102:52.65]And they wreak havoc.
[102:54.91]They wreak havoc on your fucking body.
[103:01.02]Computers aren't natural, but they're not on my head.
[103:08.87]Stop smoking cigarettes.
[103:10.01]Stop eating so much cheese.
[103:14.44]You can eat cheese, but don't eat a lot of it.
[103:16.10]Eat, like, just a small amount of cheese.
[103:20.52]Cheese?
[103:21.50]I want cheese and peppers.
[103:27.98]VR headset.
[103:31.53]That doesn't sound like something Alex Jones would say.
[103:41.13]Less cigarettes.
[103:42.19]Less cheese.
[103:43.91]Less soda.
[103:46.87]More fat- ooh!
[103:47.43]Did I do it?
[103:49.19]I think I- I think I unlocked it.
[103:51.81]I unlocked it, I did.
[103:53.57]Alright, cool.
[103:54.27]We got the- we got a difficulty unlock.
[104:06.98]Yeah, but what I was saying is less cigarettes, less cheese, more fish, more screaming, more, you know, rage is actually pretty good for you.
[104:17.21]It's good for you.
[104:17.93]Rage.
[104:20.45]Let it out, you know, like just let it out sometimes.
[104:23.54]It's good for you.
[104:24.42]Just don't go overboard.
[104:25.58]Alright, who is this?
[104:32.02]Less sugar, less processed sugar.
[104:35.08]You can eat as many fruits and vegetables as you want.
[104:39.01]But as long as it's not processed sugar.
[104:41.27]You know what the fucking Food and Drug Administration level of how much sugar you should be taking in a day is?
[104:48.00]32 grams of sugar.
[104:50.00]There are 26 fucking hundred people here right now.
[104:53.12]Do me a favor.
[104:54.90]At least half of you have to be drinking like a soda out of a bottle, right?
[104:58.70]Spin that thing around, take a look at the fucking recommended surveys on it.
[105:01.45]It's definitely two servings in that bottle.
[105:03.87]And it's probably 28 grams of sugar in one serving.
[105:06.79]So in that one bottle of fucking Mountain Dew Code Red, my favorite, there's like 50 grams of sugar in there.
[105:13.32]That's twice the daily recommended food and drug administration.
[105:17.05]And you know what?
[105:17.77]Fucking get rid of them.
[105:18.81]Get rid of that shit.
[105:19.51]Net neutrality?
[105:22.11]We gotta fucking make sure that net... Fight for the fucking internet.
[105:25.57]You know what I'm saying?
[105:26.37]No more sugar.
[105:32.11]Alright, we got this now.
[105:35.78]So, okay, the green hats are the bandanas.
[105:40.60]Do we have any other deductions?
[105:41.86]Okay, so the pink sneakers is the tank.
[105:46.61]We'll get a lot of pink sneakers.
[105:49.56]Red nose.
[105:50.12]Okay, so we're looking for green nose and pink sneakers.
[105:55.38]This guy.
[105:57.28]This guy.
[105:57.88]How did Soda get into net neutrality?
[106:00.89]I don't know.
[106:07.69]And hey, guess what?
[106:08.41]Speaking of net neutrality, my internet's fucking dying right now.
[106:12.79]You understand?
[106:13.55]I'm dropping frames right now.
[106:15.37]Net neutrality?
[106:16.55]They heard me.
[106:17.23]I just started talking about it and now they're bringing me down.
[106:23.41]Comcast has the cone on the door listening to me.
[106:27.85]Yeah, get this.
[106:28.47]We gotta fucking get a sugar-free internet here.
[106:38.65]It's stupid.
[106:39.59]Alright, we're good.
[106:44.87]Oh, by the way, Bitcoin is a decentralized fucking currency.
[106:49.37]You guys want to talk about fighting net neutrality?
[106:51.59]Bitcoin is defucking centralized.
[106:54.98]No banks own that shit.
[106:56.80]The FCC doesn't own that shit.
[107:02.88]There ain't no high fructose corn syrup pumped into BTC.
[107:06.04]Excuse me.
[107:09.93]Ethereum's at a fucking all-time high.
[107:18.04]Fuck.
[107:24.22]I know too much.
[107:26.58]Dogecoin?
[107:27.44]You know what's really funny?
[107:28.14]I own 5,000 Dogecoin.
[107:29.14]It's like $5.
[107:30.00]I had to do it.
[107:37.03]I own 5,000 Dogecoin.
[107:38.82]It was less than like $5.80.
[107:45.26]It wasn't that much money.
[107:46.08]Don't worry.
[107:46.42]I did it for like a fucking funny.
[107:50.38]Okay.
[107:50.90]Let me think about this.
[107:53.80]Cyclops is that.
[107:54.79]What about the BDIs?
[107:57.35]Don't fuck this up.
[107:58.09]Stop talking about like... Easy.
[108:02.15]We're looking for green nose and purple nose.
[108:07.03]So I'm going to assume it's red is probably one of these.
[108:09.59]Because all I have is green noses and fucking yellow noses.
[108:14.25]No, I have pink noses too.
[108:15.38]Shit.
[108:18.64]Green is definitely... I fucked this up so bad.
[108:28.32]At least I know that... So we're looking for... The spring.
[108:33.80]The spring is the only thing that hasn't been seen.
[108:37.21]spring of the propeller so propeller is definitely this because there's only there's only one I only have one propeller so it's definitely has to be this person and this is how it has to be
[109:18.24]What the fuck is going on?
[109:19.36]You know what I actually was thinking about?
[109:23.63]Setting up like a bitcoin wallet.
[109:25.11]And just like having it out there.
[109:29.05]And everybody else just like gives a shit about cryptocurrency.
[109:34.50]You know how, like, oh, I can give you bits.
[109:36.02]Maybe I would set up, like, a Bitcoin wallet.
[109:38.80]To, like, accept Bitcoin if anybody cares.
[109:41.29]There'd be very many people, I don't think.
[109:47.21]Drink.
[109:47.55]Nobody died.
[109:55.47]Do it.
[109:55.75]Do it.
[109:55.99]The game is very loud.
[109:57.05]Is it really?
[109:58.13]I'll fix that.
[109:59.10]Fixed it.
[110:02.82]Bits are short for bits.
[110:03.94]Oh my god, this is timed.
[110:04.98]This is fucking timed.
[110:10.24]Oh shit, I'm gonna lose.
[110:11.42]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:12.58]It's noses.
[110:14.19]Is it noses?
[110:16.73]Oh shit!
[110:17.77]In my direction.
[110:19.91]I always use that.
[110:20.99]Okay, so it's definitely propellers.
[110:23.71]There's no propellers.
[110:25.07]It's boots.
[110:25.73]It's shoes.
[110:26.05]Hurry.
[110:27.19]Hurry.
[110:30.51]Get your drinks ready?
[110:31.27]No, don't get your drinks ready.
[110:32.25]It's not gonna happen.
[110:32.75]I have plenty of time.
[110:40.84]If they would not take so long to get in.
[110:42.60]Hurry up.
[110:52.15]Bitcoin has, like, exploded.
[110:53.37]It really has.
[111:00.53]Where's the Dogecoin donation address?
[111:07.51]I would never set that up.
[111:10.19]I would get like a hundred million Dogecoins.
[111:12.81]Yes, there is.
[111:23.67]Have you got to lower the volume?
[111:24.67]No, I didn't.
[111:26.47]I did.
[111:27.63]What are my thoughts on fart coin?
[111:32.42]See, that's the thing about cryptocurrency.
[111:35.24]There are so many of them, and there are so many fucking stupid ones.
[111:39.34]Sometimes it's fun just to go to one of the exchanges and just look at all these weird fucking crazy coins.
[111:45.04]Doesn't even make any sense.
[111:46.88]There's a fart coin.
[111:48.01]Why?
[111:48.61]Who made that?
[111:49.15]Who mines that?
[111:50.13]Somebody has to mine that fucking coin.
[111:51.87]You understand that?
[112:00.86]Okay, so it's triangle and then colors.
[112:05.65]I wish there was an expedite.
[112:11.27]Sugar coin.
[112:13.31]Jerma bucks.
[112:15.69]Your mom mines fart coin.
[112:17.99]Come on, dude.
[112:18.71]Like, what?
[112:21.37]You can do better than that.
[112:22.18]There's a fuck coin?
[112:27.00]Of course there is.
[112:31.89]Alright, so if we set up like our own cryptocurrency, and it was like Jerma Bucks, like who would mine that?
[112:36.95]Would you guys mine that?
[112:38.97]Would you guys mine bald coin?
[112:50.06]What the fuck?
[112:54.08]God damn it.
[112:55.64]Let's go with this, no, not the star.
[112:58.38]Circle?
[112:58.68]Yep.
[113:12.13]I have mine balls going all day.
[113:17.92]Someone do it.
[113:23.12]Four more years of Dean Dinkus, yeah?
[113:25.14]Alright, so we got, this pink is all done.
[113:29.82]We need red square, red square.
[113:34.66]Then we need blue square.
[113:43.08]What kind of market share do you think we would get from a fucking Jerma coin?
[113:48.16]What would be the message?
[113:48.89]What would be the reason why we did it?
[113:49.99]Must be a reason why you're going to set up like a mining a cryptocurrency.
[113:56.37]Now we need blue.
[113:57.53]I'm spending way too much.
[113:58.65]I'm spending way too much fucking blood coin here.
[114:03.73]What would a triangle, blue triangle?
[114:08.01]Blue diamond.
[114:11.43]For the memes.
[114:12.65]Oh god.
[114:16.39]Vault coin is the new world currency.
[114:25.20]Just because.
[114:27.64]Alright, here we are.
[114:31.50]Keep it going.
[114:40.15]Rumble coin.
[114:41.21]Alright, we only have two more.
[114:43.47]Oh, I have to do this stupid... Remind me never to go down again.
[114:47.29]This is so easy.
[114:49.67]Can I please prove that I'm not in the fucking fifth grade?
[114:54.23]I wish I could set it in the very beginning like I was a parent.

[115:29.62]Don't even fucking look at it.
[115:30.58]Don't even look at it.
[115:31.50]How many shoes we got?
[115:32.40]We got two Zoom shoes.
[115:33.48]I already got it.
[115:43.68]I have no clue what's going on in this game.
[115:47.40]How old is your child?
[115:48.28]Well, he's balding.
[115:48.96]No big deal.
[115:51.81]We got regular shoes.
[115:54.09]We got you.
[115:55.11]No, you got your Cyclops.
[115:56.19]What about funny boots?
[115:58.83]No, shit.
[116:02.85]See you guys next week.
[116:04.25]For real.
[116:10.78]Oh, God damn it.
[116:15.20]This one always gets me.
[116:22.05]Got it.
[116:27.97]Purple boots, beady eyes.
[116:29.43]Okay, we got springboards.
[116:35.89]Nope, no spring.
[116:38.53]Look for propeller.
[116:40.37]No.
[116:42.22]Regular boots, regular boots.
[116:44.88]Green.
[116:45.48]I gotta get a look from far away.
[116:47.46]There it is.
[116:49.60]That's the problem.
[116:50.08]I'm not playing on the couch.
[116:53.06]Can you do two at a time?
[116:53.94]I don't think you can.
[116:55.98]Unfortunately, you cannot.
[116:59.40]No, you can't.
[117:01.26]What do we got?
[117:06.76]Got it.
[117:12.45]I made you play this game on some old... You can get it on Steam.
[117:15.33]This is actually... It's on Steam.
[117:16.59]I'm on Windows 10.
[117:17.89]It works from Windows 10.
[117:19.99]No problems at all.
[117:27.46]This would be a lot better to watch without the annoying sounds in the background.
[117:32.40]That's half the reason why you play Zumbinis.
[117:39.99]Glasses?
[117:40.43]No.
[117:41.25]Propeller?
[117:42.13]No.
[117:43.87]What is it?
[117:44.37]Fuck.
[117:44.61]One of the springboards?
[117:47.63]Where?
[117:48.89]No, it's not this one.
[117:49.67]Where is it?
[117:55.20]fuck I'm seeing triple I haven't had any I've had like fucking two and a half drinks there it is I got it
[118:29.22]Again.
[118:29.48]Oh, this one takes too long.
[118:31.02]I don't want to have it go down.
[118:32.54]We have to go up from now on.
[118:34.68]We have to deal with this stupid frog ship.
[118:36.12]Who cares?
[118:36.48]Propeller.
[118:39.88]There it is.
[118:40.34]Come on.
[118:40.82]Hurry up.
[118:45.61]The background art is pretty nice.
[118:46.67]It is.
[118:46.89]This game is very good on the eyes.
[118:49.87]It's nice on the eyes.
[118:53.63]Boots?
[118:53.95]No.
[118:55.01]Zoom shoes?
[118:56.61]Mm-mm.
[118:58.50]No propellers.
[119:00.26]Got it.
[119:07.79]Well, we're halfway there.
[119:10.45]Getting close.
[119:11.25]It's going to get much easier from here on out.
[119:17.64]Look at how easy it's gotten.
[119:20.92]Wait, did you mix brain fluid with alcohol?
[119:22.98]Dude, you can't do that.
[119:23.84]Already did.
[119:24.24]Maybe that's why I can hear birds in my head.
[119:37.50]We got Zoom Shoes, we got one right here already.
[119:44.38]What a madman.
[119:49.59]Yep, BDIs.
[119:54.59]Fartcorn.
[120:00.63]I can't believe there's an actual, like, market share for that.
[120:04.11]That is so... That is so outrageous.
[120:09.73]How many bits for me to take a shot?
[120:11.19]Absolutely zero.
[120:11.97]I don't do that.
[120:13.73]If I want to take a shot, I'll take a shot.
[120:15.61]I'm not gonna be like, give me the five bucks and I'll fucking put a shot up my ass.
[120:20.25]No.
[120:20.69]I'm gonna fucking do it if I want.
[120:25.87]Every ten subs, I do a vodka enema.
[120:30.74]How about you just do it if you feel like it?
[120:32.30]Butt chug.
[120:41.89]God.
[120:43.13]Alright, we're almost done with this.
[120:49.89]Mm-hmm, put it down.
[120:53.09]Here you are.
[120:55.83]Vodka enema coin.
[121:00.62]By the way, you should only be drinking if you're over the age of 21.
[121:02.58]No drinking under 21.
[121:06.80]Do you understand?
[121:10.58]Absolutely not.
[121:14.73]Okay, here we go.
[121:15.23]This is very easy.
[121:18.75]Cyclopses go this way, then they go down, then they go up, then they go left.
[121:22.53]Okay, hold on.
[121:24.91]So if you have a Cyclops, if you go this way...
[121:28.40]Then you're done.
[121:29.38]You go down, you go up, then you go left.
[121:32.05]And you're just done.
[121:32.61]So no Cyclops can go this way.
[121:33.81]If you're a Cyclops here, you go across.
[121:36.19]So all Cyclopses have to go up here.
[121:39.89]If you're not a Cyclops, you die.
[121:43.31]So non-Cyclopses go this way.
[121:46.07]And they end up going right, down, left, up.
[121:50.96]Did this get harder?
[121:51.74]This got harder than the last one.
[121:54.14]This did get harder.
[121:55.50]Don't tell me it didn't, because it did.
[121:58.03]Okay, so all Cyclops.
[121:59.27]Fuck.
[122:00.21]Okay, we need people with this hair that are Cyclopses.
[122:02.26]Where are you?
[122:05.40]Get over here.
[122:05.80]I don't want to fuck this up.
[122:14.08]Okay, so if you have no Cyclops, go up.
[122:19.13]You're going to end up going this way too, but if you have funny hair, you go up and then you go back the other way.
[122:23.01]No, no, no.
[122:23.35]Wait.
[122:23.65]Hold on.
[122:25.08]God damn it.
[122:25.74]Alright, down.
[122:27.44]Let's just get the Cyclopses out of here.
[122:31.43]Put all the Cyclopses over here.
[122:34.97]We'll work with you later.
[122:36.19]Alright, all the Cyclopses with that fucking haircut.
[122:41.05]Step forward.
[122:43.21]Okay.
[122:47.67]That's it.
[122:47.93]There's only two.
[122:50.07]So you guys have to go this way.
[122:54.86]I'm fucking doing this right.
[123:03.71]I'm doing this right.
[123:06.23]Because then you go, okay, these guys are going to be safe.
[123:10.03]They go straight over there.
[123:13.11]Anybody else?
[123:14.49]What about the guys with the funny sprouts?
[123:17.63]Funny sprouts.
[123:19.89]So if you go up.
[123:30.23]All Cyclopses can go this way, but I just need to make sure that I'm not fucking this up.
[123:37.51]Every Cyclops gone.
[123:40.78]Don't you hide back there.
[123:51.77]I know all Cyclopses go on this one, I'm just making sure.
[123:56.53]So then, the people that don't have this fucked up haircut need to be, I need to put them in between.
[124:02.16]Because now, no cyclops, nobody else can go on this one.
[124:05.34]So only, okay, what hair do you have?
[124:07.78]So if you're gonna go this, you're gonna go straight up.
[124:10.39]You're gonna go right, you're gonna go down.
[124:11.59]You're gonna go left, you're gonna go up.
[124:12.85]So you can't go here.
[124:14.03]It has to be one of you.
[124:16.21]Because then you go up, down, you go across.
[124:19.56]Okay, guy with the fucking sprout.
[124:23.15]Now I can send somebody with the lowest line haircut.
[124:33.40]Is that correct?
[124:33.92]Because then you go... Okay, yeah, it is.
[124:42.06]And then a sprouty guy can go here.
[124:47.08]What about these guys?
[124:47.78]I don't think it matters for them.
[124:51.81]No, it doesn't.
[124:56.86]These guys can just go now.
[124:57.46]Wait a minute, hold on.
[124:58.32]Don't fuck this up.
[125:01.29]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait Jeremy, hold on.
[125:09.00]Okay you have to go there now.
[125:16.00]Okay, so now I have to split it.
[125:19.00]I didn't kill- I did not kill him, he's fine.
[125:22.00]He's going up here and he's going right.
[125:25.61]Now a Sprouty here.
[125:29.19]Right?
[125:33.03]Yep.
[125:35.25]One of these guys.
[125:36.91]You, one of the... Okay, I got it.
[125:37.97]I'm good.
[125:39.03]Figured it out.
[125:39.75]We're all good.
[125:44.38]Everything is fine.
[125:52.86]Another batch of 16.
[125:54.92]has made it across.
[126:01.12]That was correct.
[126:04.04]Two IQ chat, 200 IQ streamer.
[126:08.00]That's how it always is.
[126:12.06]Right?
[126:14.15]And you both go up this way and then across.
[126:16.37]We're good.
[126:22.44]Yeah, how can you not trust the guy that took in like four vials of brain fluid?
[126:30.12]Is there a speed it up button?
[126:35.30]All 16.
[126:35.96]Alright, now I get a higher difficulty.
[126:46.94]What is brain fluid?
[126:48.98]Oh, you missed the first part of the stream.
[127:05.25]Did I unlock anything else?
[127:06.15]Got fireworks.
[127:13.01]What's that?
[127:15.17]No, not yet.
[127:15.65]Alright, let's do it again.
[127:19.59]Here we go.
[127:20.48]Take a look.
[127:21.28]We unlocked the next difficulty right here.
[127:25.32]The next time we're going to go up.
[127:27.72]Not down.
[127:30.04]It's not that it really matters, right?
[127:31.64]It doesn't.
[127:33.25]We're going to... Let's do it.
[127:40.49]Random.
[127:40.91]We don't need... It's alright.
[127:42.11]We just need to have it random.
[127:43.87]This is now a full 100% harder.
[127:49.59]This booty deal sucks.
[127:52.49]Well, now I have to actually pay attention.
[127:58.01]The frog is way worse, it is.
[127:59.25]Alright, this is not for children anymore.
[128:02.33]This is for teenagers.
[128:04.05]Or for middle schoolers.
[128:08.49]Alright, is it green noses?
[128:11.09]That's the only green nose.
[128:12.15]Oh, that's great.
[128:12.99]What about hair?
[128:15.47]Nope.
[128:20.60]It's not hair.
[128:23.86]Maybe it's eyes.
[128:25.28]Beady eyes?
[128:27.86]Nope.
[128:29.34]I don't want to lose immediately, please.
[128:36.27]So it's not hair, it's not eyes.
[128:39.29]What about propeller?
[128:42.61]Seems like it might be shoes.
[128:45.95]This was a computer lab game you would play after typing out your class essay or making a 2003 PowerPoint.
[128:52.65]This guy gets it.
[128:54.18]This guy gets it.
[128:59.60]Choose.
[129:00.80]Easy.
[129:04.28]Yeah, it goes children difficulty, middle school difficulty, adult difficulty, and then not possible.
[129:10.77]This game on very, very, very hard is not physically completable.
[129:14.79]And you'll see why.
[129:17.48]It's not possible, and I'm not going to pretend like it is.
[129:25.80]I should play Kid Picks.
[129:27.04]We already talked about Kid Picks.
[129:30.98]That was like the 1993 classroom.
[129:35.87]It was like paint.
[129:36.89]It was old.
[129:37.35]It was before paint even existed.
[129:38.99]Alright, everybody with shoes go... I think what it is is shoes and...
[129:47.52]All the weird shit goes down to the bottom.
[129:49.98]That's what I'm going to assume.
[129:50.70]Yeah, we're good.
[129:56.63]We got it.
[130:01.63]See how hard that was?
[130:07.46]Oh, fuck.
[130:11.10]Alright.
[130:14.20]How about this?
[130:14.92]You're going to see something here.
[130:17.46]In a minute, I'll show you.
[130:19.26]Let's play math blasters.
[130:23.72]Let's go this way.
[130:29.00]Nope.
[130:33.79]If I complete one in particular, we're going to go up to the bubble place on as hard as it can possibly be.
[130:44.26]And you'll see why I deserve like a thousand dollars if I complete it.
[130:50.43]After this, we'll be all sure.
[130:52.13]Not all doors are open to you.
[130:56.01]You know, fuck it.
[130:56.79]We're going to do it now.
[130:59.25]I want you to see this.
[131:01.09]Very, very hard.
[131:02.97]Okay?
[131:05.92]Watch this.
[131:19.30]If I get one person across, I deserve $100.
[131:24.64]Up, left, right, portal, green nose, stardust.
[131:31.24]And you thought this was for a child?
[131:34.54]No children can do this.
[131:36.98]Let's just see what happens.
[131:39.35]I don't even know where the person's supposed to go.
[131:46.34]Okay, I pressed a button somewhere.
[131:48.13]I pressed a button, a red button turned us... How do you even get that to move?
[132:00.26]Let's go with the yellow nose.
[132:07.50]No, I did it wrong.
[132:08.76]Green nose.
[132:14.58]I have to get one person across.
[132:16.02]I think I have to bump him.
[132:30.73]I can't send anybody over here.
[132:35.65]Bump this guy.
[132:36.37]He's dead.
[132:36.71]That guy's gone.
[132:43.46]Uh, okay.
[132:43.90]What about I need a yellow, but yellow noses are gone.
[132:46.01]I don't have any yellow noses.
[132:46.97]I can't even do this.
[132:47.63]It's impossible.
[132:48.15]It's not possible.
[132:48.93]Uncompletable.
[132:53.25]What does this button do?
[133:05.54]If you have a red nose, you go this way?
[133:10.25]Let's see if that happens.
[133:11.59]If you have a red nose, do you go to the right?
[133:18.78]Nope.
[133:24.16]Everybody's slowly waiting to die.
[133:35.39]I can't do it.
[133:35.93]There's no winning.
[133:43.83]How did you get over there?
[133:44.61]How did you get over there?
[133:47.04]What?
[133:47.38]How?
[133:47.52]I don't know what I did.
[133:53.14]This guy made it over here.
[133:57.22]Okay, I pressed that button.
[133:59.78]Okay, hold on.
[134:00.60]Hold on here.

[145:12.07]We could do... I don't know what this one's going to be on very hard.
[145:21.20]How could you make this one any more difficult?
[145:27.15]She killed a lot of people for that pizza.
[145:29.51]But how are you supposed to make this any harder?
[145:33.81]It's the same thing, right?
[145:39.22]Okay.
[145:41.50]So, we're looking for glasses.

[152:25.89]Do the pizza again?
[152:26.71]We'll do the pizza again.
[152:28.43]Pizza's the best one.
[152:34.12]Do reflections on very, very hard?
[152:35.76]We'll do that after this.
[152:43.30]The mine?
[152:43.81]We'll try as many as we can on very hard.
[152:47.92]Alright, so already, I don't know.
[152:49.35]We're just gonna go with pineapple.
[152:53.89]Not pizza again.
[152:54.99]Pizza's the best one.
[152:57.55]I don't like it.
[153:01.57]She likes it.
[153:04.45]I can work with this.
[153:05.29]I can work with this.
[153:07.75]I don't think she likes cheese though.
[153:11.42]We're gonna go with this.
[153:12.06]We're gonna go with a little bit of chocolate sauce.
[153:19.08]A fleen?
[153:19.62]A fleen are the people that were in the forest.
[153:21.76]The thing I just did.
[153:22.48]That's a fleen.
[153:24.36]She likes that too.
[153:30.78]The ones I was trying to match with in the forest with the bees, those are fleens.
[153:34.92]None of this matters, you're on practice.
[153:36.58]Yeah, but alright, to get to this level, I need to beat the game like fucking 12 times.
[153:46.31]Chocolate.
[153:48.46]And she wants maybe mushrooms.
[153:50.10]Maybe?
[153:50.30]No.
[153:50.38]No mushrooms.
[153:51.22]No mushrooms.
[153:55.16]So she wants chocolate.
[153:56.88]Pineapple.
[154:14.64]Fucking peppers.
[154:16.56]And then hit me a bent-by-an-apple apple pit.
[154:22.55]Sorry.
[154:22.87]Good, good, good.
[154:29.77]Brute-forcing puzzles.
[154:30.93]That's how you have to do this.
[154:33.92]You have to brute-force these.
[154:35.10]Otherwise, how else would you do it?
[154:43.20]I already look I already apologized that means that nobody can be mad at me Jesus oh, there's something on that.
[155:00.63]I don't want I think we see our first death here pizza coin
[155:07.30]No, nobody died.
[155:08.61]Alright, so you want chocolate sauce, pineapple, peppers, pepperoni, and cheese?
[155:16.57]It's just ice cream.
[155:18.19]Sprinkles or a cherry or something.
[155:23.50]He's gonna die.
[155:37.13]One punch, right?
[155:38.03]No?
[155:39.87]So it's all about the ice cream with her.
[155:41.21]Let's try sprinkles.
[155:47.21]And hopefully that's it.
[155:55.86]Alright, she's done.
[156:00.20]She already rejected the cherry.
[156:02.71]How is that possible?
[156:07.63]She already rejected the cherry, so what's left to put on there that she doesn't like?
[156:15.81]How am I this bad at this?
[156:17.13]What are you talking about?
[156:17.80]This is like the just total logical deduction!
[156:22.42]There it is!
[156:25.10]There is the pizza that she's gonna eat.
[156:26.38]She's happy.
[156:38.69]So nobody wants cheese.
[156:43.53]Nobody wants cheese.
[156:45.59]Apparently.
[156:46.89]What do they start with?
[156:47.57]Like pineapples or something?
[156:48.49]What about just like... Fuck.
[156:52.17]I've lost track.
[156:54.04]What does he not like in the very beginning?
[156:55.32]Let's just try like pepperoni.
[156:59.78]I would eat all those.
[157:02.39]No pepperonis.
[157:06.82]Local streamer proves that brute force is logically efficient.
[157:12.26]Brute force is logically efficient when there's only a certain amount of categories.
[157:16.31]Nobody wants pepperoni.
[157:20.31]What about just like fucking cherry?
[157:30.73]Uh oh, there's something on that I don't want.
[157:34.39]Shit.
[157:42.23]Did really two people have to die for this?
[157:45.39]So you don't want pepperoni, you don't like cherries, neither one of you do.
[157:53.07]Brute forcing a logic puzzle.
[157:56.27]I'm not brute forcing a logic puzzle.
[158:00.75]I'm making pizza for two people.
[158:04.41]And they keep telling me they don't like it.
[158:05.82]Violence in video games causes murders in real life.
[158:13.56]They don't like sprinkles.
[158:15.78]They don't... How can you not like sprinkles?
[158:18.81]You understand?
[158:20.91]How is that possible?
[158:25.67]How is it possible that you don't like sprinkles?
[158:29.91]Everybody does.
[158:33.37]You know what I'm saying?
[158:33.89]Like everybody does.
[158:35.09]How could you not like these?
[158:43.12]Oh, these are bad.
[158:44.34]These are bad.
[158:49.83]These are real bad.
[158:52.93]When I'm chewing these, it tastes like I'm chewing on actual worms.
[158:57.99]They turn to this weird putty.
[159:00.49]un-chewable, terrible, disgusting feature in my mouth.
[159:12.34]Brain fluid!
[159:13.06]Okay.
[159:15.96]It's been like fucking 10 minutes.
[159:17.10]It's been like an hour.
[159:18.31]I haven't even had a fucking brain fluid.
[159:20.41]Are you fucking kidding me?
[159:28.09]It's been like fucking 25 minutes?
[159:31.05]Haven't even had a brain fluid?
[159:38.18]Here it is.
[159:38.56]Okay.
[159:56.65]Don't recommend.
[159:57.19]I don't recommend you ever do that.
[160:01.50]I don't recommend that.
[160:03.12]I don't recommend that at all.
[160:07.03]I don't recommend you do that.
[160:09.89]That was very bad.
[160:10.71]That was very bad.
[160:13.95]If I were to rate that on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say I'd probably say maybe like a 4.
[160:23.64]Don't do that.
[160:23.98]That was gross.
[160:33.72]Everyone's like so concerned.
[160:34.76]I got this from like a children's science kit.
[160:37.65]It's like, dude, you're supposed to drink these dumb things.
[160:42.99]This is about the ages eight and up.
[160:45.69]Not only for the stream, but for the fucking products on the stream.
[160:51.57]It's called tasty science.
[160:53.57]I'm going to be alright.
[160:55.31]What do they want?
[160:57.05]Oh, fuck.
[160:57.96]I didn't mean to do that.
[161:01.74]Come on!
[161:03.81]more stuff it's still missing my favorites here comes a burp by the way you want to give this to your kids what's wrong with people alright I can't blow this let's go with
[161:30.80]Wait, wait, wait.
[161:31.78]So you actually liked it.
[161:35.76]Fuck.
[161:37.46]This is how I did this back when I was... When I was like eight years old.
[161:45.13]I used to do it like this.
[161:46.17]And this is how I'm going to do it.
[161:51.13]That's all he wanted.
[161:59.78]He just wanted mushrooms.
[162:02.77]Everybody that made fun of me for this shit down here.
[162:05.51]This means that nobody wants any of the things on here.
[162:07.97]Really.
[162:08.25]Because he just wanted mushrooms on pizza sauce.
[162:15.35]Everyone's going to tell me I was incorrect.
[162:28.90]What about just a cherry?
[162:29.88]Is it going to be just a cherry again?
[162:32.96]I can't believe I broke my keyboard again like a fucking idiot.
[162:35.16]Gee, I wasn't expecting that one.
[162:37.40]I'm so unhappy about that.
[162:38.60]I made something down there on the pizza nobody wanted.
[162:45.66]I already did this like twice.
[162:53.22]Alright, so it's cheese.
[162:58.60]He wants a cheese pizza.
[163:00.66]That's all he wants.
[163:03.29]For me?
[163:05.27]I told you.
[163:06.99]These guys are so boring.
[163:16.24]Why did so many people have to die?
[163:17.44]I don't know.
[163:19.88]Alright, let's go to the mirror.
[163:26.51]What is this telling me to do?
[163:27.39]I don't understand.
[163:33.20]I don't get it.
[163:39.44]Pink nose?
[163:45.30]What the hell are you doing?
[163:50.33]This is not correct.
[163:51.01]I need that hair.
[163:52.49]Okay.
[164:06.31]What the hell is going on right now?
[164:19.25]Wait, so I... So I need the hair and then the blue nose, green nose.
[164:35.80]That's a red nose.
[164:44.73]I don't understand.
[164:45.63]What happened?
[164:51.38]I'm not pressing the button right now.
[164:53.60]Why is it just killing people?
[165:06.84]I give up.
[165:07.22]I have no idea.
[165:08.24]That was outrageous.
[165:14.08]This is way too many rooms.
[165:17.62]Alright.
[165:34.52]Don't even tell me this is like a... Don't even fucking tell me that this is somehow... I'm like an idiot for not being able to do this.
[165:42.32]1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
[165:43.86]5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
[165:43.96]25, 50, 70, 100.
[165:44.08]125 spaces.
[165:44.46]Okay.
[165:44.72]Okay.
[165:44.86]Okay.
[166:04.10]What if I just put them all in their own room?
[166:06.38]It's not gonna happen.
[166:07.48]Alright.
[166:09.18]What about your eyes?
[166:15.49]Can anybody else go anywhere else?
[166:17.89]You can go up there.
[166:18.49]What about you?
[166:20.35]Can you go over here?
[166:25.99]Um...
[166:34.91]How would anyone ever be able... How would you deduce this?
[166:44.39]Don't guess.
[166:44.89]Look at the traits.
[166:45.71]Alright, this guy's got glasses, red nose, red and shoes in the hair.
[166:53.92]But can these guys share a spot?
[166:58.46]Red nose, shoes...
[167:02.72]I'm locking up soon.
[167:03.86]Better get indoors.
[167:07.23]Only two of you get to survive.
[167:13.97]Fuck it, whatever.
[167:17.45]Drawing the screen with a whiteboard pen?
[167:19.31]Look at this shit.
[167:23.72]Alright, so we need feet connected here.
[167:25.40]Already shocked somebody.
[167:33.41]And then nose has to connect here.
[167:36.25]And then hair has to connect to the middle here.
[167:38.17]So hair.
[167:41.31]Hair again.
[167:41.85]This game is 21 years old, is it really?
[167:51.12]So what does this mean?
[167:52.02]Can anybody know?
[167:52.72]Anybody can go here.
[167:54.70]Same shoes.
[168:00.32]What's up there?
[168:01.08]Eyes?
[168:01.28]I mean the glasses?
[168:05.08]Zoom shoes.
[168:07.22]Zoom shoes again.
[168:09.44]Same eyes.
[168:12.43]We need the same nose over there.
[168:13.67]We need a yellow nose.
[168:15.97]You fucking dummy.
[168:17.39]Come on.
[168:23.62]Sunglasses.
[168:24.46]We can figure it out in a minute.
[168:28.52]So you can't be there.
[168:29.48]So we need another yellow nose.
[168:31.66]You.
[168:32.84]Cyclops.
[168:33.80]Don't have any cyclopses.
[168:34.80]Okay, so what about you?
[168:40.27]Glasses?
[168:41.77]Bingo.
[168:43.23]We got eyes.
[168:44.01]We need another glass.
[168:45.97]How's the only one that's correct?
[168:54.80]That's the only one that's correct.
[169:06.38]How is that possible?
[169:10.14]That's it, right?
[169:11.59]Alright.
[169:21.02]We'll try this one on very, very hard.
[169:28.02]So this doesn't tell you anything, so let's just try going with... Alright, he's in the right spot.
[169:36.90]If you fuck it up, it will put them in the right spot.
[169:40.30]This is just Saw for kids.
[169:44.64]Maybe it's Nose.
[169:49.46]It's not Nose.
[169:50.16]Hair?
[169:55.32]I think it is here.
[169:57.28]It is.
[169:57.94]Bingo.
[170:01.17]So that leads into you have this kind of hair.
[170:04.49]Oh, fuck.
[170:05.29]Okay.
[170:06.01]Let's go backwards with it.
[170:08.05]I can only fuck up three more times.
[170:09.29]Two more times.
[170:10.77]Come on.
[170:14.84]It goes by hair, then by nose color.
[170:21.50]Hold on.
[170:24.12]Hair...
[170:26.59]A nose?
[170:32.98]Nobody else has that hair.
[170:33.88]Okay, so that makes sense.
[170:38.48]So then who else has that hair color?
[170:40.40]Hair cut?
[170:41.36]You do.
[170:43.39]It's pink and green.
[170:46.79]Alright, we're almost there.
[170:47.75]I can actually say I deduced a very, very, very hard puzzle.
[170:53.93]There's only two of you.
[170:56.47]So that means you go here.
[170:58.21]You go there.
[171:00.23]You go here.
[171:01.47]Oh, god damn it.
[171:02.57]Alright, hold on.
[171:04.51]I can't fuck this up again.
[171:08.13]So it goes red, red, wait, no, green.
[171:12.21]And there it is.
[171:14.87]That's not brute force.
[171:19.21]That's not brute force, guys.
[171:24.04]What else can we do?
[171:26.29]Let's try that one, we tried that one.
[171:28.31]We didn't do the bayou.
[171:32.43]I'm not even gonna attempt it.
[171:36.35]Not even gonna.
[171:39.91]This one we didn't do.
[171:40.91]Play just brute force.
[171:46.07]Let's try this.
[171:50.22]Alright.
[171:51.42]You have same hair, same eyes.
[171:55.34]Is it a hair thing?
[171:57.46]It is a nose or feet thing.
[172:05.15]So he doesn't care about that.
[172:09.77]Where do they all come from?
[172:10.59]That's a good question.
[172:11.17]By the way, there are two more games.
[172:14.01]There's Logical Journey of the Zumbinis and the Mountain Rescue.
[172:17.39]And then there's Island Escape.
[172:18.77]And yes, I've bought all of them.
[172:21.67]The other ones are on Steam though.
[172:22.95]That's the way to play the other ones.
[172:25.88]Um, let's go this way.
[172:29.32]Okay, is it a spring thing?
[172:31.48]Is a spring thing and a hair thing?
[172:33.54]Maybe?
[172:34.88]Yeah?
[172:36.86]Let's see if it's just a spring thing.
[172:38.46]Okay, it's a hair thing, a nose thing, a nose thing.
[172:44.92]She's gonna be okay with this.
[172:47.75]I think.
[172:49.63]Mm-hmm.
[172:52.85]The second one's the best one.
[172:54.31]We'll have to check it out.
[173:03.54]Well, the big guy in the middle.
[173:08.46]Give the illogical journey of the Zambonis a shot.
[173:11.04]A little real game.
[173:21.33]So it has to be over here.
[173:24.74]Oh, God.
[173:25.16]I'm going to lose this one.
[173:25.90]It's going to start caving in.
[173:26.72]Not all doors are open to you.
[173:32.64]So why are you loud up here?
[173:34.42]Is there a cyclops?
[173:36.68]Mm-hmm.
[173:38.66]Go on.
[173:41.68]Okay.
[173:44.07]You'll do.
[173:47.03]No.
[173:50.03]What's the logic behind this one?
[173:52.83]Trying to figure that out as we speak.
[173:55.58]I don't know.
[173:56.84]Go ahead!
[173:57.68]Go ahead!
[173:58.66]How am I still on this one?
[173:59.70]No, we went back and we, like, are playing this one again.
[174:01.84]We're almost done with the game.
[174:06.05]We're almost done with the game.
[174:06.81]Go ahead!
[174:14.45]Go ahead!
[174:14.67]What else can I play here?
[174:15.57]I'm shooting for, like, three hours.
[174:16.85]Okay.
[174:19.51]Maybe something else, maybe for, like, a half hour or so.
[174:22.89]Ugh.
[174:28.26]I'm guessing?
[174:28.95]I'm not guessing.
[174:31.77]I'm deducing this by logical reasoning.
[174:38.21]See?
[174:38.45]And now I know I can't go here either.
[174:44.11]I know this one goes here.
[174:45.87]Alright, fine.
[174:46.65]If I get this one wrong, then I will turn off the stream.
[174:52.05]If I get this one wrong, the stream turns off.
[174:54.05]You understand?
[175:15.64]I thought I got it wrong twice No, this was a three strikes you're out policy if I get strike three here in the stream turns on Let's see that that was strike two now.
[175:34.51]We're good strike three didn't happen.
[175:35.95]We're fine stream doesn't need to turn off yet Everything is good everything is golden oh
[175:46.75]I got an achievement.
[175:49.31]Leave.
[175:53.03]No, I'm not going to leave.
[175:54.67]I'm not leaving.
[175:55.47]It's not going to happen.
[175:58.01]Absolutely not.
[176:01.30]It's four strikes in your route.
[176:02.56]There's only four choices.
[176:07.74]Well, you got to see this is the logical journey of the Zoombinis.
[176:11.94]It's a fun game.
[176:14.78]I highly recommend you give it a shot.
[176:16.74]If you have any small children.
[176:21.60]In the meantime, I'm going to take a piss.
[176:24.48]Grab one more drink.
[176:27.31]Oh.
[176:29.91]So, thanks for watching the stream, guys, because I don't have my keyboard doesn't work.
[176:32.97]I can't use it.
[176:33.45]Is there a game I can use only with the mouse?
[176:42.64]Because I have to only play a mouse game.
[176:45.10]I don't know.
[176:52.08]What can I do?
[176:52.65]Alright, what if I go to Steam and type in mouse only?
[177:03.81]Use the Windows on screen keyboard.
[177:08.28]Hold on.
[177:13.21]I can't even type that in, guys.
[177:17.51]I can't type in Windows on-screen keyboard.
[177:19.61]I have no access.
[177:22.92]I can't even get to Steam.
[177:26.76]Let's try.
[177:27.18]Let's try to open Steam.
[177:29.40]I have to type my password in.
[177:31.04]What?
[177:34.06]Let's see.
[177:34.32]Can I get there from my mouse clicks?
[177:35.85]I think I can.
[177:37.95]I have to copy and paste letters.
[177:46.49]Something is real wrong.
[177:51.81]I am not kidding.
[177:53.25]Something is really wrong.
[177:55.57]I would like to show you guys something here.
[177:57.02]I'm gonna... My keyboard is unplugged.
[178:11.12]I think I may have severely fucking fucked up my computer.
[178:22.38]I'm gonna show you guys my monitor and we're gonna try to figure out what the fuck is happening.
[178:26.69]Just give me one moment.
[178:30.43]Hold on.
[178:44.11]Somebody explain to me why this is happening.
[178:54.96]Can you see?
[178:55.36]Just so you guys are clear.
[178:59.04]Just so we're clear about this.
[179:02.33]My keyboard is unplugged.
[179:05.67]You saw me unplug it.
[179:08.75]Why is this happening?
[179:13.86]What does it think is happening right now?
[179:23.66]What's wrong with my wallpaper?
[179:25.00]This is a guy swimming.
[179:32.00]I'm just clicking.
[179:36.51]Hold control.
[179:37.47]The keyboard is not plugged in.
[179:41.11]Why is it holding control?
[179:42.27]The keyboard is not even in.
[179:51.48]It's physically not plugged in.
[180:00.18]Did I activate tablet mode?
[180:01.60]No, I didn't.
[180:02.18]Yeah, the one thing on my... Clive Barker is undying.
[180:05.76]Alright, hold on.
[180:14.33]Plug in and unstick it?
[180:16.05]Control was the last command sent to the registry.
[180:26.29]Did I...
[180:28.56]It's a bad... If you don't want to stream, just end the stream instead of doing this.
[180:32.54]I'm not... This is not a fucking joke.
[180:34.36]I'm not making a joke.
[180:37.93]I didn't want to end the stream.
[180:38.95]The stream's still going.
[180:41.23]Well, looks like it's going to have to be an IRL fucking drink stream.
[180:49.13]So I talked to Cortana.
[180:50.37]Cortana's not even... It doesn't even work.
[180:56.11]I heard a popping sound.
[180:57.25]What is... What?
[181:03.40]Prove I'm not holding control.
[181:06.12]Okay.
[181:13.60]I can't even go over into OBS.
[181:15.34]I can't do this.
[181:16.80]I physically can't do it.
[181:18.16]Because in OBS it thinks I'm holding control and I'm selecting like three things at the same time.
[181:26.48]If you could see my OBS right now, you would understand.
[181:29.66]Because now, guys, now I can't turn the camera off.
[181:34.33]The cam is on forever.
[181:35.35]It's not being turned off.
[181:37.13]I can move around like this.
[181:42.57]Like, here we go.
[181:43.73]Can you see that?
[181:47.86]Okay, hold on.
[181:51.26]This is bad news.
[182:01.04]Why is my hair messed up?
[182:03.66]Because I was drinking and playing Zumbinis.
[182:10.78]I actually think I might have to leave.
[182:13.71]There's nothing I can do.
[182:15.23]Everything is fucked.
[182:16.49]The whole thing is fucked.
[182:20.05]I can't even open up paint.
[182:26.75]What if I do that?
[182:27.95]Okay.
[182:28.73]I can sit here like this.
[182:33.71]Windows ease of use.
[182:35.83]How do I?
[182:36.05]Okay, what about Cortana?
[182:37.31]How do I get Cortana to work?
[182:42.39]I can learn to understand you much better if I can get familiar with the way you talk.
[182:46.89]I need your permission to help.
[182:49.03]Great.
[182:53.23]Cortana, what are you doing?
[182:54.75]Cortana, stop it.
[182:55.83]Cortana.
[182:56.53]Cortana, please.
[182:58.31]Cortana.
[182:59.95]Great, thanks.
[183:00.91]That's not what I wanted.
[183:02.11]Excuse me.
[183:04.87]Start the football quiz?
[183:06.81]I don't want to start a football quiz.
[183:13.33]Alright, thanks for watching everybody.
[183:15.33]That's gonna be it.
[183:18.79]I don't think there's a way I can get out of this.
[183:25.58]Is there?
[183:30.74]Start the football quiz.
[183:38.31]Cortana.
[183:40.23]Start the football quiz.
[183:43.69]True or false?
[183:45.57]No NFL team has a human mascot.
[183:48.11]False.
[183:48.75]New England Patriots has a fucking human mascot.
[183:52.07]Bitch.
[183:55.11]That was false.
[183:56.98]The Minnesota Vikings mascot is based on a legendary Viking named Ragnar.
[184:03.16]Give me another football question.
[184:09.65]Give me another football question.
[184:13.09]True or false?
[184:14.95]The Detroit Lions were called the Portsmouth Pirates before moving to Detroit in 1934.
[184:19.61]True!
[184:21.87]True.
[184:24.39]This one's actually false.
[184:25.96]Fuck you.
[184:26.84]The Detroit Lions used to be called the Portsmouth Spartans when they were based in Portsmouth, Ohio.
[184:32.46]Why does it want me to do football questions?
[184:38.32]Cortana find me uh cheap PC parts that are under 200 dollars oh my God it's it worked it worked this thing actually is pretty useful
[185:08.33]Worked.
[185:18.58]Cortana, I'm looking to try to take my wife out for a movie this weekend.
[185:22.24]What are the show times at the Boston Theater?
[185:35.28]This one didn't work.
[185:44.20]That one didn't work.
[185:48.48]Try one more.
[185:51.52]Cortana.
[185:53.02]What temperature is it outside right now in Boston, Massachusetts?
[185:56.08]And I'm going on a ski trip next weekend in New Hampshire, in Portsmouth.
[186:00.29]Any clue on what the temperatures are going to be like in that fucking city?
[186:08.17]Right now, it's clear and 39 in Boston.
[186:10.17]Nice!
[186:18.06]Okay.
[186:18.86]Opening Cortana.
[186:20.08]Hey!
[186:20.38]What is it doing?
[186:23.52]Gaming quiz.
[186:25.06]Cortana.
[186:25.54]Hey, can you do me a favor?
[186:27.62]Do a little gaming quiz.
[186:29.16]Okay.
[186:29.84]Starting Cortana.
[186:31.49]What is this fucking turned into?
[186:33.55]Just wait.
[186:33.99]Hold on.
[186:35.41]Cortana.
[186:36.59]I would like to do a game quiz.
[186:38.39]Video game quiz.
[186:39.55]Do it again.
[186:45.73]Close.
[186:49.45]Cortana, how do I make my hair not look like shit on stream?
[186:53.73]This thing sucks.
[187:01.84]Cortana, video game quiz.
[187:09.22]Not gonna work.
[187:12.12]Whatever.
[187:13.60]I'm gonna try one more thing.
[187:16.00]Cortana, open the on-screen keyboard.
[187:22.00]Opening on-screen keyboard.
[187:24.04]Easy.
[187:26.60]The setting is not found.
[187:27.62]I don't have this setting.
[187:31.93]Don't start it with Cortana.
[187:36.05]Open on-screen keyboard.
[187:40.87]Opening on-screen keyboard.
[187:48.50]Got it.
[187:51.40]Okay, now what do I do here?
[187:54.28]How do I get this to work?
[188:00.34]What can I even do with this?
[188:06.51]How do I make it stop pressing control?
[188:10.43]Oh god.
[188:12.23]Play a game like this.
[188:13.73]It's gonna I'm gonna be crouching the whole time I can't stop it Control doesn't watch look I'm telling you it doesn't do anything.
[188:27.24]I can't stop it.
[188:29.04]It still thinks I'm pressing control In fact, it thinks I'm holding.
[188:33.01]Okay, there we go That was it still thinks I'm doing it
[188:41.25]The Windows key is being held down.
[188:44.48]Okay, but let's play a game.
[188:47.28]I'm going to give it a try.
[188:49.02]Let's see what game I can try with this.
[188:51.10]Give me one sec.
[188:51.48]It's going to be on the other monitor.
[188:57.17]I need a game that can play in a window.
[189:03.25]Why is it not typing?
[189:04.35]Type.
[189:04.45]Type.
[189:09.03]This isn't doing anything.
[189:10.15]This is just here for show.
[189:15.73]Turn off sticky keys.
[189:19.25]Press the shift key five times.
[189:21.29]No, you do it.
[189:22.11]According to community members.
[189:24.21]You do it.
[189:27.72]It's going to switch applications.
[189:29.32]It's not going to work.
[189:34.64]I can't type with the Windows key held on.
[189:40.52]Hey Cortana, give me a funny fact.
[189:44.62]In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a huge three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the underworld, allowing the dead to enter, but letting none out.
[189:54.00]Hey Cortana, give me another funny fact.
[189:59.77]Sorry, I can't do this for you right now.
[190:02.49]Check back agai- Cortana, can I get a- can I get a little funny fact, please?
[190:09.11]It says opening web browsers.
[190:10.37]Alright, what am I- what am I- it's time for me to leave.
[190:12.77]It's time to go.
[190:24.18]Thanks for watching the Zoombini stream.
[190:27.16]I need to buy a new keyboard.
[190:30.01]I'm gonna read bits, and then I gotta go.
[190:32.11]I can't do anything.
[190:34.39]Cortana Open Pornhub.
[190:37.14]No.
[190:37.82]I'm not going to say that.
[190:41.00]You want me to lose my stream license?
[190:45.64]Unplugged?
[190:46.00]The keyboard is unplugged.
[190:48.24]I've already done that.
[190:55.13]Six to seven hour stream.
[190:56.21]Now, that's before I did, like- like, the stupid, shitty children's baking soda joke.
[191:01.90]Ruined another keyboard Restart the computer then I get the stream has to turn off and it's just not gonna be pretty Plug it back in you think it'll work if I plug it back in what if I get the other one maybe the other one's been like Unplugged for long enough and fucked up for long enough that I don't have to worry about it anymore Alright for the record I ain't gonna like break another keyboard I
[191:36.58]Plug it in and press the start button.
[191:40.17]You feel like this is a joke?
[191:41.21]It's not a joke, I swear to God.
[191:44.65]How regularly am I destroying computer parts?
[191:47.37]This was not my intention.
[191:52.49]Control is not being pressed anymore, which is good.
[191:58.45]Anyways.
[192:01.83]Tomorrow.
[192:03.25]I'm streaming tomorrow.
[192:07.14]And I might stream on Monday as well.
[192:12.07]Because of Thanksgiving.
[192:14.09]Hopefully everybody had a good Thanksgiving.
[192:23.33]Best Buy.
[192:23.83]Look, it's Black Friday.
[192:25.06]I'm going to go to Best Buy right now and go buy one.
[192:27.58]It's still Black Friday.
[192:28.40]They're open until like 4 o'clock in the morning.
[192:35.20]What time tomorrow?
[192:35.96]Tomorrow will be probably the same time.
[192:37.96]Probably around like 6 or 7.
[192:43.54]Why do I always have to break things?
[192:45.20]I don't know.
[192:45.92]I'm a fucking dumbass.
[192:51.95]You had a good Thanksgiving?
[192:52.85]Well, good.
[192:55.11]Did I plug it back?
[192:55.89]I tried plugging it in, plugging it in.
[192:57.33]I tried to plug it in, plug it in, plug it out, plug it in.
[192:59.45]It doesn't work.
[193:03.78]I have to clean up this desk, too.
[193:05.12]It's a fucking mess.
[193:08.00]IRL Brack... Brack... Black Friday.
[193:19.84]How did I break it?
[193:20.64]I was doing a stupid, dumb, shitty thing in the beginning where I was doing like a brain fluid thing.
[193:27.20]Let's go watch the beginning of the stream.
[193:28.48]It was dumb.
[193:28.98]It was awful.
[193:32.57]Let me read some bits, though.
[193:34.11]Thanks everybody that stuck around.
[193:35.25]Hopefully if you enjoyed Zimbinis, it's on Steam.
[193:37.41]It's fun.
[193:37.91]It's interesting.
[193:39.85]And tomorrow, just wait, I'm going to eat like a Lunchables on stream and continue my quest for getting recognition from people that ask me to do weird things.
[193:54.17]Actually, I am going to do that, by the way.
[193:56.29]But thank you, Jeff, for the $5.
[194:00.10]Here's some bits towards your new keyboard.
[194:01.46]Try and make this one last.
[194:02.68]It won't, but thank you, Jeff.
[194:05.34]Patroli, thanks for the $1.12.
[194:07.28]Handsome hot boy.
[194:08.25]Holy fuck.
[194:09.11]You didn't say fuck, but I added that.
[194:10.21]Thank you.
[194:12.45]Patroli, thanks for the $0.38.
[194:14.79]And Trida, thanks for the $2.
[194:16.25]Mind Sweeper.
[194:16.87]I don't even know how to play Mind Sweeper.
[194:20.75]Edgemont gave $50 like 10 minutes ago and I missed it.
[194:28.12]I'm going to buy a bunch of Lunchables on Black Friday.
[194:32.15]Gotta stock up.
[194:33.67]There's a storm coming.
[194:36.78]Here's some more bits to the keyboard fun, but I wanted to ask towards the end of the stream.
[194:40.38]Do you plan on mining or purchasing cryptocurrency?
[194:43.50]I'm planning on using my old rig to mine some Litecoin, maybe Ethereum.
[194:47.34]Just still doing the research for all of it.
[194:48.75]Don't OD on brain fluid, man.
[194:52.43]From my understanding, mining... Hold on, let me change this.
[194:57.45]Mining cryptocurrency apparently is...
[195:00.61]It's kind of difficult to do unless you have a lot of stuff, a lot of equipment to do it.
[195:06.02]To make it profitable for Bitcoin, I guess, you have to have a large amount of power.
[195:12.18]And you can't just do like one computer.
[195:14.58]Oh, I got like a GTX like 780.
[195:17.37]I'm going to mine Bitcoin.
[195:18.43]You're going to lose like $100 a month because just it's the sheer amount of electricity it's going to cost.
[195:24.42]But like Litecoin, I don't know anything about mining cryptocurrency.
[195:28.92]I just like to follow the news and follow what's happening in the space.
[195:33.28]It interests me in a way.
[195:37.30]You don't mine Bitcoin.
[195:39.84]Not anymore.
[195:41.94]Maybe like five years ago.
[195:48.96]But Litecoin probably.
[195:50.96]Litecoin is still pretty cheap.
[195:52.96]I'm assuming it doesn't take that much
[195:57.58]Mining is literally useless unless you own a giant warehouse full of specialized hardware.
[196:01.60]That's kind of where it's gotten, but Litecoin, though, maybe not so much because it's how cheap it is.
[196:05.97]I'm not sure.
[196:10.15]But thank you, Edgemont, for the $50 and all the money you've given so far.
[196:13.31]It's a lot.
[196:17.51]I'm Monk.
[196:18.15]Thanks for the $0.25.
[196:19.15]Right-click the blank space on the start bar and press show touch keyboard.
[196:23.07]It's just up there.
[196:23.99]Cortana hates me.
[196:26.08]I wish it was not the case, but it is.
[196:31.54]Devlon, two million.
[196:32.52]Thanks for the one dollar.
[196:33.26]Plug the thing back in.
[196:35.82]I'm kind of scared to do that considering I... Can't you like fry your motherboard if you have like a broken keyboard that's sending the same signal over and over again?
[196:43.91]Can't you fucking break it?
[196:44.83]I'm scared now.
[196:46.89]This computer was a lot of money.
[196:49.11]That would be very bad.
[196:52.18]But thanks.
[196:53.52]Corvid Moon, thanks for the 50 cents.
[196:54.96]Dark Maniac, thanks for the 25 cents.
[196:57.50]Is the X upside down?
[196:58.50]No, it's not.
[196:59.14]No?
[196:59.40]Are you sure?
[197:00.08]I always thought that you could really fuck up your computer if it sent a bunch of the same signal or something.
[197:06.75]Didn't somebody tell me that last time?
[197:08.23]That I broke it?
[197:09.03]I swear to God.
[197:15.35]The liquid is on the keyboard, not the PC.
[197:17.19]I heard that you can do something bad to your computer.
[197:22.78]I should know this.
[197:23.32]I'm a goddamn PC doctor.
[197:24.58]That's true.
[197:26.93]Remove Kojima, thanks for the $1.
[197:29.17]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[197:30.37]Am I ever going to play A Hat in Time?
[197:34.19]I would like to.
[197:36.34]In fact, at this point now, there is not a whole lot of major releases coming out anymore.
[197:40.84]I do still want to go back to Hand of Fate 2.
[197:44.60]Well, maybe we'll tap into some of these games that have come out recently and play them.
[197:49.30]But thank you, Nightfang.
[197:50.14]Thank you, Edgemont, for the 20 bucks on top of everything else.
[197:54.52]Don't overdo it, Jerma.
[197:58.54]That's my M.O.
[198:01.68]I overdo everything.
[198:04.22]And it gets me in trouble sometimes.
[198:07.02]But thank you, Edgemont.
[198:09.34]Much appreciated, man.
[198:11.36]Stormy2, thanks for the $1.
[198:12.46]I forgot this one.
[198:13.10]Sorry, please don't hurt me.
[198:14.06]I'm not an idiot, I swear.
[198:15.20]What?
[198:15.30]What are you talking about?
[198:24.16]More FMV games.
[198:26.01]One of the things I am going to do is we did the whole PlayStation 3 kind of nonsense.
[198:32.51]Dreamcast is the next system I want to do for old, strange games.
[198:38.11]I feel like there's a lot there.
[198:40.63]Get an old Dreamcast.
[198:41.99]Plug it into an HD port or something.
[198:46.27]Upconvert it so we can play some old Dreamcast games.
[198:50.76]There's a lot there.
[198:53.51]Because we're done with PlayStation 3.
[198:57.43]Devlon, 2 million.
[198:58.73]Thanks for the $1 again.
[199:01.05]In my younger and more vulnerable years, father gave me some advice.
[199:03.65]It's a great Gatsby.
[199:04.99]That's a book.
[199:06.37]Leonardo DiCaprio was that book.
[199:07.75]He was in that book.
[199:09.56]Stormy2, thanks for the $14.
[199:10.52]Use this to buy yourself your own perfect pizza.
[199:14.36]You deserve it for being a wonderful person.
[199:16.00]Thank you, Stormy.
[199:19.06]Much love.
[199:20.75]I promise you I will buy a perfect pizza.
[199:22.78]My perfect pizza is thin crust crispy.
[199:28.62]It's got to be really crunchy and crispy on the bottom.
[199:31.02]No doughy pizza.
[199:31.88]I don't like doughy pizza.
[199:32.68]Get that out of here.
[199:34.38]Too chewy.
[199:35.54]Like you're mouthing it, you're gumming it.
[199:36.96]No.
[199:38.50]Crispy thin pizza with onions.
[199:43.24]Good cooked onions.
[199:47.52]And maybe some barbecue chicken and barbecue sauce.
[199:50.20]Barbecue chicken onion pizza on a crispy crust.
[199:53.23]Get out of here.
[199:54.63]It's perfect.
[199:56.81]New York style pizza is by far the best.
[199:59.71]Or just straight up cheese.
[200:03.77]Thin and onions.
[200:04.61]Yes.
[200:05.23]What?
[200:07.05]What are you guys on about?
[200:11.09]That isn't pizza.
[200:13.77]Yes, it is.
[200:15.61]Just a slice of cheese, even just a slice of cheese thin cross crispy pizza.
[200:19.19]That's all you need.
[200:19.83]And like you shake a little bit of parmesan and gets all in the oil and turns into this parmesan oily crispy.
[200:25.02]It's great stuff.
[200:32.84]Thank you at Mastar fish.
[200:36.06]Thank you at Mastar fish.

[200:50.37]The Middleman's thanks for the $1.
[200:51.67]How many bits for you to take a shot?
[200:53.33]Zero.

[200:58.62]I don't do that.

[201:29.88]Don't worry, Jeremiah, drink enough brain juice and have enough insight and you'll ascend to cauliflower squid head and you won't have hair anymore.
[201:36.93]Problem solved.
[201:39.29]That's true.
[201:40.15]That is a true statement.
[201:42.43]Thank you, Chibble, for the one dollar.
[201:43.59]Listen, Jeremiah, I know I've been saying I'm moist and wet when watching your streams, but I'm getting serious here.

[202:03.23]Watching your streams make me want to throw money at you, but I don't know what to say, so here's a pun.
[202:08.57]I bought some shoes from a drug dealer.
[202:11.55]I don't know what he laced them with, but I've been tripping all day.
[202:18.60]I don't know about that one.
[202:22.00]But did you go to, like, jokes.com and find that?
[202:25.64]Ay-yi-yi.
[202:28.76]Thank you, pin, for the $1.

[202:46.16]When I get bullied at school...
[202:50.70]I can't wait to come home and vent at my favorite streamer by calling him names.
[202:54.76]Haha.
[202:57.60]Oh, that's the ha... That's the emote haha.
[203:03.54]The proper use for that haha is what?
[203:05.64]When somebody does something... That's... Did you say cringey?
[203:12.74]How many times have I... How many times have you guys used that emote on me?
[203:15.74]Like, non-ironically.
[203:16.74]Probably like fucking a hundred times.
[203:22.28]Sorry, whatever.
[203:32.42]Too much.
[203:33.60]Never.
[203:34.10]Once.

[204:48.63]Well, to start off there, if anybody ever sees me to amend the previous thing I said, by all means, wave me down and say hello.
[204:59.44]It's actually happened more than you guys would think.
[205:02.26]Just randomly at random places that I would never expect.
[205:07.09]Like in a mall, at like a random grocery store.

[205:21.08]Happens like... In places that shouldn't happen.
[205:26.48]In the bathroom.
[205:28.15]In my kitchen.
[205:33.53]But if you do see me at some point, please, yes, I hope you do say hello.
[205:38.41]And Dark Maniac also says, I was depressed for a long time, but then stumbled upon your channel and helped me in ways you can't even imagine.
[205:44.26]Also hope that brain fluid helps you remember to not ruin a keyboard for a joke.
[205:50.26]Well, thank you, Dark Maniac, so much.

[218:45.43]Will do.
[218:46.20]Thanks a lot, man.
[218:49.32]And sometimes it's hard to keep up.
[218:51.38]I've said this before.
[218:53.34]Money that rolls in, subs that roll in.
[218:55.30]I'm not trying to be disrespectful if I miss your bits or I miss your subs.
[219:00.82]It's hard for me to even keep up.
[219:08.70]amount of subs that come in the amount of money that comes in it's hard to keep track of and keep up with sometimes which is why I want to make it very clear that that's no amount of me thanking people for giving me money is is ever going to be enough for me for me to say because like I turn the stream off and I'm just like I sit here sometimes and I'm just like oh come on I can do you can do better than that Jeremy
[219:36.31]Like, there's no amount of money that, like, I could ever accept and know.
[219:41.37]Like, you know what I mean?
[219:42.45]It's hard to accept that kind of money in my brain.
[219:47.03]It's the reason why I didn't set up things like this until recently.
[219:49.71]Like, the whole bits and even subscriptions, too.
[219:52.07]You guys knew I was, like, very anti-donations and stuff for a long time.
[219:56.84]Those of you guys that have been watching the streams and YouTube videos for, like, two or three years now.
[220:03.80]It has nothing to do with necessarily doubting myself.
[220:06.51]I want it to be worth it.
[220:08.73]If you're going to give me $100, this stream should be worth it for you.
[220:14.53]And I hope it is.
[220:21.78]But I do have trouble sometimes keeping up on it.
[220:23.80]I feel terrible about it.
[220:29.68]Push your keyboard into the fucking desk.
[220:32.36]I know.

[221:39.33]What the fuck did I think I was gonna be?
[221:43.17]I've had issues in my life.
[221:44.63]Plenty of them.
[221:47.91]It's a symbiotic relationship.
[221:49.76]You know what I mean?
[221:50.32]It's like, you guys have done the same fucking thing for me.
[221:53.36]Over the last five years.

[222:41.01]I want to know who else is in that house.
[222:45.77]What's the game?
[222:46.53]I actually, I don't know.
[222:47.69]There's a couple of options tomorrow.
[222:49.94]I have to get in touch with Kryken.
[222:51.60]Because I think Kryken wanted to play something and it's like this weird multiplayer game and we're going to check it out.
[222:58.74]Who knows?
[223:00.70]Could go back to Hand of Fate.
[223:03.83]It's called like Intruder or something?
[223:09.89]We'll see.
[223:12.29]But thank you all for sticking around.
[223:13.65]You guys are incredible.
[223:17.21]Thank you fucking for everything.
[223:19.95]Does not go unnoticed.
