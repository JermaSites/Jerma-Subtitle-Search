[00:05.51]God, I hate.
[00:06.41]That's the worst comment of the whole year.
[00:08.81]But somehow also the best one.
[00:18.48]Alright, got a water.
[00:21.02]Stay hydrated, right?
[00:23.38]So the plan is to do speaking simulator as it was voted for.
[00:30.30]That's what people voted for.
[00:40.42]Why don't we just pl- Okay.
[00:42.34]Listen to me.
[00:42.70]Why don't we just play it... For... Like... 10 minutes or something.
[00:50.47]And we'll figure it out after that.
[00:51.53]Like, you want me to veto this?
[00:55.97]Should I- Should I veto this game?
[00:57.21]I mean, I already bought it.
[00:59.84]What do I- Why am I supposed to play it for like 10 minutes?
[01:08.12]Play it for 5 minutes.
[01:08.82]Alright, I'm gonna play it for 5 minutes.
[01:16.23]Who cares?
[01:16.71]You haven't streamed in a week.
[01:19.69]What?
[01:21.77]I streamed like three days ago.
[01:22.67]I streamed in a week?
[01:30.99]Just refunded on stream.
[01:37.13]Same difference.
[01:37.95]Alright, let me just come back here.
[01:42.93]We can get this off the screen.
[01:48.67]So I'm going to play it for five minutes.
[01:50.11]And then I'll give you some other... You know, let me see.
[01:53.85]What have I got for veto options here?
[01:55.57]Let me take a look.

[02:03.83]Oh, you know what?
[02:08.22]I got Elderborn.
[02:10.30]Elderborn looks like it's... I was going to play Elderborn anyways.
[02:22.28]Alright, it's either going to be Elderborn or... I'm not starting the Surge 2 right now.
[02:29.86]Alright, bear with me.
[02:34.49]I'm going to play Speaking Simulator for five minutes.
[02:36.09]Put a countdown.
[02:38.69]Elderborn is Snooze.
[02:40.47]It is?
[02:42.77]It looks pretty fun.
[02:49.84]I'm going to open it.
[02:55.41]I'm just going to try it.
[02:56.39]I'm just going to try it.

[03:46.67]That's not correct.
[03:54.58]Here.
[03:55.78]It's even in the title, guys.
[04:06.56]Alright, help me.
[04:07.40]Who did this?
[04:08.88]How about we do, um... Help me?
[04:15.52]Uh, tongue movement.
[04:16.56]Click and drag lips, eyes, and brows to smile.
[04:20.53]W-A-S-D is tongue.
[04:23.29]Okay.
[04:30.19]Sorry, but you are now alive.
[04:35.78]May help with your condition.
[04:36.66]I thought I was going to read it.
[04:38.80]How will it infiltrate and destroy human society?
[04:41.12]Okay, so... Hair.
[04:50.21]Meal food one?
[04:51.85]This is not very much... Specified chunk?
[05:00.56]What?
[05:00.78]I don't understand.
[05:18.29]This is you, a perfect human replica, the peak of our engineering technology.
[05:21.43]Not this game.
[05:22.79]Look at the title.
[05:26.84]Wink.
[05:34.32]Alright, let's go.
[05:34.94]Try the draw mechanism.

[05:41.09]Okay.
[05:41.73]That was inspiring.
[05:42.27]You're very inspired.
[05:42.95]Very good, very good.
[05:43.81]Let this praise wash over you.
[05:46.69]Good.
[05:47.01]Now that you're sufficiently motivated, you will learn to stretch and pucker your lips.
[05:51.85]You can drag outwards from the lip center to stretch.
[05:53.87]Drag in towards the lip to pucker.
[06:04.32]Okay.
[06:07.10]Activate tongue.
[06:10.07]Use WASD to move up, down, left, and right.
[06:12.27]Press the green buttons with your disgusting tongue muscle.
[06:15.96]Okay, I just did.
[06:29.57]Despite being an unfeeling AI, I'm proud of you.
[06:31.89]You're ready to face real humans.
[06:33.71]Do I have to talk?
[06:34.33]You have to talk.
[06:35.81]Level 1, The Date.
[06:36.83]Can you stop playing now?
[06:37.71]Just read the title!
[06:39.05]Manager of Human Resources, Karen, has asked us to meet at this human food dispensary.
[06:42.95]We do not know why.
[06:43.65]Show caution.
[06:44.22]It is possible that they suspect we plan to destroy humanity.
[06:49.20]Sorry, I'm late.
[06:49.70]Traffic was terrible.
[06:50.54]Hello?
[07:09.63]What button do I have to press?
[07:14.29]Oh, I get it.
[07:16.70]Okay.
[07:19.84]I am glad we're doing... Finally doing... Thank you.
[07:21.58]I knocked all my teeth out.
[07:22.70]There's something going on here.
[07:24.46]Nope.
[07:28.33]Thank you.
[07:35.13]I am just a normal person.
[07:47.69]Okay, I got it.
[07:49.35]I think something's definitely going on.
[07:53.73]I think we both know that there's some attraction here.
[07:56.99]Yes, I must confess that as a war
[08:09.28]Say it!
[08:09.54]I got it.
[08:38.41]You're such a flirt, I love it.
[08:41.37]Let's get a drink and you can tell me more about how you like me.
[08:45.78]How many units of currency are required?
[09:05.40]Just two fermented ethanol beverages.
[09:15.67]This game is me?
[09:20.97]Why have you been playing this game for six hours?
[09:22.51]I have not been playing this for six hours.

[11:32.73]For what?
[11:36.99]What's this for?
[11:46.07]Requires smile.
[11:48.83]Smile.
[11:50.51]Express your innermost feelings as if they exist.
[11:52.61]Alright, let's get it.
[11:53.49]Smile.
[11:57.31]Alright, what else can I do?
[12:00.11]Left, right.

[17:53.18]Controls.
[17:54.46]Mouth sensitivity.

[19:05.34]Right in the middle.
[19:15.16]This game looks fun.
[19:27.46]We've been told legends of the day that the sky has fallen.
[19:31.60]The world filled with death and despair as the land of our ancestors turned to ash.
[19:37.56]But the tribes, we survived.
[19:40.62]At the center of all destruction, a mighty city rose in the desert.
[19:45.37]Yurmum.
[19:46.53]Feeding off the strange power flowing from the never-ending test of life.
[19:52.21]It remained unconquered.
[19:56.67]Jormungand its golden army was the bane of the realm for ages.
[20:01.86]The tribes toiled in its shadow, bound in its relentless grip, enslaved and oppressed.
[20:08.58]It's just a little compressed because it was too big.
[20:10.64]They want to make it under like six gigs.
[20:12.04]They united their tribes and led them against the city.
[20:15.81]His name was Janus, a hero anointed by elders, standing a giant among men.
[20:25.41]You making excuses?
[20:26.25]All of a sudden you guys care about voice acting?
[20:28.43]Silent Hill 2 is some of your favorite game ever made.
[20:33.09]Resident Evil 1 is like some of your guys favorite game.
[20:36.67]You really care about voice work?
[20:54.42]In every generation, a champion of the tribes is chosen by the elders.
[20:59.82]With their blessing, they are set upon a holy pilgrimage to explore the city.
[21:06.21]The champion is decided in trial by combat.
[21:19.32]I've mastered all my brothers and sisters.
[21:22.65]In this generation, the holy quest is mine.
[21:27.73]Leaving the familiar desert sands behind me, I enter forbidden caves.
[21:33.50]This is the only remaining way to the sealed off city.
[21:38.68]No one returned from the pilgrimage.
[21:41.25]Yet, there is no fear in my heart as I stare into the darkness.
[21:46.76]Gripping my weapon, I step into the shadows.
[21:50.82]And the shadows come alive.
[21:55.38]It's a cool looking sword.
[22:01.00]Not Rain World.
[22:02.04]What do you mean Rain World?
[22:03.72]Where did that even come from?
[22:05.55]Where did that even come from?
[22:07.44]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[22:08.42]We really want you to play Rain World today.
[22:10.50]What the hell are you talking about?
[22:12.22]A little bit more, like 93.
[22:21.61]I want a little bit more sensitivity.
[22:25.21]Okay, here we go.
[22:32.61]Oh, fuck, that feels kind of good.
[22:40.67]Oh, there's a dash?
[22:41.55]Okay, that hurt.
[22:42.07]Hold E to interact with objects.
[22:45.25]Alright.
[22:50.84]Some mechanism is working nearby.
[22:57.10]Activate a fountain to save progress.
[22:58.84]Drinking from an active fountain will heal you, but also bring back slain enemies.
[23:02.00]Dark Souls!
[23:11.19]Fix the FOV?
[23:12.05]What's wrong with it?
[23:13.57]What?
[23:16.43]Was 93 too much for you?
[23:29.45]Make it higher.
[23:33.69]Left shift to dash in any direction.
[23:35.21]You can perform attacks while doing so.
[23:37.33]Use this to your advantage.
[23:41.77]Alright, well, what about... Do another FOV joke.
[23:54.75]Our first enemy of the game.
[23:59.85]Tap left mouse button for light, hold left mouse button for heavy.
[24:04.11]Actually feels pretty good.
[24:11.21]Actually, it feels pretty good.
[24:11.97]Alright, this is... Oh, I brought him back to life, right?
[24:25.64]I thought it... Oh, it's active.
[24:27.10]Right.
[24:27.30]Okay, you can't hold it.
[24:39.03]Am I watching inside of a fishbowl?
[24:41.15]No, what?
[24:42.39]Hold right mouse button to block incoming attacks.
[24:44.25]Some attacks are unblockable.
[24:45.53]Pay attention to the icon.
[24:48.31]What, it's a dash?
[24:54.23]Okay, you can only do it for like one second.
[25:00.69]That is the Dark Souls sound.
[25:02.49]That is the... Quake FOV.
[25:06.69]What are you talking about?
[25:08.35]What?
[25:11.22]Do you want more?
[25:12.64]I have to kick.
[25:23.00]No, no, you're gonna make me fucking puke.
[25:31.89]Ooh, there's stuff in here.
[25:38.53]I want to change kick to one of the worst mouse ever buttons.
[25:49.88]Kick is not going to be F. It's going to be this button.
[25:55.50]Okay.
[25:57.02]Use healing file.
[25:58.54]Okay.
[25:58.96]That's going to be this mouse button.
[26:02.70]Next weapon, that's fine.
[26:03.68]Quick swap is fine.
[26:05.90]One-handed blades.
[26:06.86]Alpha 1.
[26:07.54]Alpha 2.
[26:08.20]Alpha 3.
[26:09.24]Oh, spoiler.

[26:24.80]This guy's got a shield.
[26:27.26]Mouse 3 to kick through your enemy defense.
[26:29.86]Watch for counters.
[26:47.23]This isn't Rain World.
[26:48.87]No, and you know what?
[26:50.84]You know what?

[30:38.10]I didn't do anything.
[30:40.76]I'm just playing.
[30:50.24]It's all about the block.
[30:51.22]Okay, so here's the door.
[30:57.14]Is this too loud?
[30:59.97]I think it's a little too loud.
[31:03.83]Not anymore.
[31:06.51]He's doing a gameplay voice?
[31:09.73]What's a gameplay voice?
[31:13.54]What's a gameplay voice?
[31:15.00]What does that mean?
[31:16.84]Gameplay voice?
[31:20.99]I'm just, I'm just fucking talking!
[31:24.69]I'm talking!
[31:25.51]Does it wink?
[31:34.42]Can't get this open.
[31:36.87]That was actually mad?
[31:38.87]No.
[31:43.27]Some mechanism.
[31:45.29]Okay.
[31:49.71]He's in Undead Asylum.
[31:53.41]Dying in Undead Asylum.
[31:55.93]No, I'm not.
[31:59.25]E3 game trailer.
[32:02.39]Let me just enjoy this.
[32:03.55]Ooh, it slows motion.
[32:23.60]This feels like Oblivion.
[32:27.64]Um, so what do I do with a full meter?
[32:32.56]Alright, I'm gonna start talking like this for the rest of the game so people don't fucking say that I'm, like, uh, doing an E3 voice.
[32:41.36]No, shit, that is an E3 voice.
[32:42.58]That's like, that's like, uh, look, look at, I'm like a relatable guy from, like, a city.
[32:46.22]Like, I'm from Boston.
[32:47.04]I'm, like, relatable to you.
[32:48.46]No, no, alright, alright, that's worse.
[32:50.07]Alright, um...
[33:01.25]Just do Bugleberry.
[33:02.31]No, I don't want 3,000 people to leave.
[33:16.57]Do the auto voice the whole time.
[33:18.17]That is E3.
[33:20.55]How is that less E3?
[33:23.39]Challenge completed.
[33:24.29]Wait, what?
[33:29.91]What does that challenge completed?
[33:31.27]What the hell?
[33:36.79]Might, speed, and resilience.
[33:44.46]Your attacks and skills deal more damage.
[33:46.48]Wait, can I put points into this?
[33:49.18]You move faster and your attacks are more fast.
[33:51.66]You have additional hit points.
[34:00.13]Claim reward?
[34:00.92]Okay, I claimed it.
[34:06.14]How do I... Can I use it?
[34:17.77]I claimed it, apparently?
[34:24.07]Go back to universal paperclips.
[34:25.19]I beat it!
[34:25.67]I completed it!
[34:27.11]I beat the whole game!
[34:46.47]This stream feels longer than 20 minutes.
[34:48.51]No, it hasn't.
[34:50.25]It's been, I don't know, like 15 minutes so far, total.
[35:02.55]Should I even be opening these?
[35:03.57]I have like a max bar.
[35:06.07]What's it doing?
[35:15.40]I regen health at the full bar.
[35:16.74]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[35:17.54]Somebody said Super Frog.
[35:20.96]Speaking of Super Frog, uh... I got something.
[35:26.14]I got something.
[35:27.46]I'm gonna die.
[35:48.04]Alright.
[35:48.46]Get out of my life, please.
[35:49.48]Alright.
[35:55.78]Now what?
[35:56.08]It's got candy.
[35:58.93]It does have candy.
[36:01.97]200 essence.
[36:02.69]Do I have any?
[36:07.51]Super Frog.
[36:08.17]I have something coming up soon.
[36:12.14]You guys are really going to like it.
[36:15.92]Don't kill me, please.
[36:19.01]What the fuck just hit me?
[36:22.45]I have a game compilation that was highly requested.
[36:25.09]I'm... I got it.
[36:27.03]I got it.
[36:37.38]The orange box.
[36:39.88]I finally got the orange box.
[36:41.14]I'm trying to see what the big hype about it is.
[36:52.37]Nothing in there.
[36:52.89]Fuck.
[36:55.99]Alright, this area kind of sucks.
[37:01.68]Finally got Rain World.
[37:04.56]People want to see you finish Jump King.
[37:05.84]That's not going to happen.
[37:08.38]I've been out of the game for so long.
[37:10.36]It would take me like a whole... It would take me like three days to get back to where I need to be to beat the DLC.
[37:15.68]I can't do it.
[37:19.60]No way.
[37:20.04]I got to where I wanted to get to.
[37:29.44]Shit.
[37:30.26]Oh, fuck.
[37:30.78]This is bad.
[37:31.86]This is bad.
[37:35.04]Just kill him for me, please.
[37:36.22]Kill him.
[37:39.50]Oh, Jesus.
[37:40.32]Come on.
[37:40.74]Do it again.
[38:04.06]Keep going up.
[38:06.15]Jerm of the turtle.
[38:06.99]Yeah, I'm level 1!
[38:08.13]Of course I'm gonna be a turtle at level 1!
[38:09.57]What do you think I am, like level 30?
[38:11.44]I don't wanna lose this- If I lose, I'm gonna move on to Jump King.
[38:38.94]Missed.
[38:40.70]Missed again.
[38:44.52]Oh, that was actually pretty cool.
[38:45.68]Whoa!
[38:46.68]That's a lot of people.
[38:48.26]That's a lot of people.
[38:51.18]This game looks like Sea of Thieves.
[38:53.25]Stop.
[38:55.77]Don't make me laugh right now.
[38:57.91]I don't want to lose.
[39:02.63]There's so many people here.
[39:06.81]Oh, fuck.
[39:08.21]Oh, boy.
[39:09.74]Oh boy!
[39:10.34]I'm okay.
[39:14.74]I haven't fallen.
[39:17.07]Oh boy!
[39:18.95]Come on, that was a pretty good reaction, don't you think?
[39:25.59]See you fucking thieves.
[39:26.91]Come on, man.
[39:29.59]Oh boy!
[39:33.38]Still alive.
[39:34.14]No!
[39:34.26]No!
[39:35.24]No!
[39:36.12]I wanted him to die!
[39:37.94]I wanted him to die!
[39:39.72]That's what you sound like right now.
[39:57.13]How much further does this go?
[39:59.53]I probably have like 6 million HP.
[40:18.40]What is that?
[40:18.72]Is that alive?
[40:23.89]Can I upgrade?
[40:24.59]I probably... I hope so.
[40:30.09]Activate the fountain.
[40:31.16]Made it to a fountain.
[40:32.64]Tab to level up.
[40:33.70]Leveling up is possible when the icon below is displayed.
[40:37.37]Okay.
[40:39.19]Let's heal.
[40:40.47]And then let's level up.
[40:42.04]What should I do?
[40:42.42]Speed?
[40:45.02]Speed, damage, or health.
[40:48.36]What do you guys think?
[40:53.24]Speed.
[40:53.50]1%.
[40:55.66]2%.
[40:55.70]3%.
[40:55.76]5% faster.
[40:56.04]I'm 5% faster.
[41:08.83]Didn't I claim this already?
[41:16.72]Alright, I'm good.
[41:17.66]I got the fountain.
[41:18.58]I've leveled up.
[41:19.14]Let's keep going up.
[41:20.01]It's probably a boss right here.
[41:33.63]You guys are gonna see me play this boss, and then all of a sudden, like, this Steam page is gonna get, like, 600 people new traffic.
[41:41.61]And there's gonna be, like, 350 fucking new sales.
[41:44.90]It's gonna be like, holy fuck, that was awesome.
[41:46.48]I'm gonna fucking beat this before he does.
[42:05.01]There's a lot more people here.
[42:10.86]It's an ad?
[42:11.56]It's not an ad.
[42:17.98]Rain World now.
[42:19.49]I've never even heard of this game.
[42:23.11]Shit.
[42:36.95]don't.
[42:37.21]It's a bad game.
[42:39.85]I don't know anything about it.
[42:40.71]There's no iframes.
[42:56.56]Who the fuck said that?
[43:00.00]You got the logs.
[43:14.65]Come on.
[43:17.45]Do it.
[43:19.46]Alright, can I kick you off?
[43:32.06]What you, hold on.
[43:33.16]You stay planted?
[43:34.38]What the fuck are you talking about?
[43:46.84]Do Rain World or I leave.
[43:48.24]We'll see you later.
[43:52.68]I'm not playing Rain World right now.
[44:04.71]Rainers, get ready to riot.
[44:08.19]Where did this even come from?
[44:19.68]Do I even have a stamina bar?
[44:21.06]I don't think I do.
[44:27.60]Alright, there's a shitload of people up here.
[44:30.92]Oh, you didn't want to play it, so chat now is doing this because they want to be funny.
[44:37.43]Play Vrain.
[44:40.17]Alright, I don't back up that much or I'm going to die.
[44:51.76]Wait till he swings.
[44:53.70]Gameplay voice.
[44:54.26]Alright.
[44:55.70]One, two.
[44:56.54]There it is.
[44:56.94]Opportunity comes up.
[44:58.28]Nice job.
[44:59.83]Gives a couple swings.
[45:00.41]Do it again.
[45:01.83]Gameplay voice.
[45:02.31]Okay.
[45:03.33]One, two.
[45:03.95]No.
[45:04.11]Let's try to get that one.
[45:18.32]Tuber voice.
[45:23.18]I'm the ultimate tuber.
[45:29.23]Name me a better tuber!
[45:31.75]Come on, can you?
[45:37.17]Don't you remember Facecam Fortress 2?
[45:40.10]I do.
[45:48.58]Alright, this is... Somebody said Sea of Thieves.
[45:51.16]No, this is like Brittle Hollow in Outer Wilds.
[46:06.79]Just go.
[46:13.34]Oh no, what's it called?
[46:14.32]What's that one called with the black hole in the bottom?
[46:18.24]A Kinect game.
[46:19.42]Stop.
[46:20.27]Mountain.
[46:22.87]Alright, more speed?
[46:27.55]Sure.
[46:30.19]Ooh!
[46:31.21]Successfully parry a projectile to launch it at the nearest foe.
[46:34.73]Spend less time chasing after essence.
[46:36.17]It will fly towards you on its own.
[46:40.47]I mean, that sounds... That sounds pretty good.
[46:49.74]So when I parry now, it'll launch at somebody.
[46:51.55]Alright, that's cool.
[46:54.01]That's pretty cool.
[46:54.65]Let's keep going.
[46:59.09]This doesn't open?
[47:06.16]Let's test it.
[47:08.90]Shoot at me?
[47:11.06]Shoot an arrow.
[47:14.97]Uh, is that not a parry?
[47:24.02]It's a projectile, right?
[47:26.72]The parry.
[47:29.46]Alright, where am I supposed to- Oh, there's a lever over there, okay.
[47:31.80]Am I supposed to jump and get this?
[47:34.76]No.
[47:36.67]Oh my god, hold on.
[47:42.23]Fall off?
[47:43.29]No, there's no fall joke here.
[47:59.56]It's alright, I'm brighter.
[48:14.98]Just... Pull the fucking lever!
[48:28.83]I actually have to fight my way down there.
[48:30.41]Ugh.
[48:30.49]Come on.
[48:32.29]What is this, a fighting game?
[48:37.03]Jump King now.
[48:38.11]No, I'm not playing... I'm not playing Jump King.
[48:40.17]That was a lie.
[48:41.17]So why is it... Am I not parrying correctly or something?
[48:46.50]I don't understand.
[48:57.48]I don't get it.
[49:11.42]How's that on a parry?
[49:12.13]It's not?
[49:14.27]I'm very confused by that.
[49:25.64]Is this game supposed to have music?
[49:26.58]I think it's playing.
[49:28.83]I need a different weapon to parry.
[49:30.13]Oh.
[49:31.53]Somebody's running behind me somehow.
[49:36.43]Alright.
[49:42.45]Open this fucking door, please.
[49:48.76]Eight.
[49:51.00]Ooh.
[49:52.04]What?
[49:52.52]Oh, down there?
[49:53.32]Come on.
[49:56.37]That door now opens.
[50:00.59]Does that stay open?
[50:01.49]Can I just save the game?
[50:02.27]This is pretty cool for on PS2.
[50:08.17]Alright, that's a level up right there.
[50:13.14]Let's go.
[50:17.52]Speed.
[50:27.42]Okay, I don't have enough essence.
[50:29.44]Alright, I'm 10% faster.
[50:30.82]I can do more damage next.
[50:33.50]Nothing stops the rain.
[50:35.50]I'm going to open up Rain World.
[50:39.01]And people are going to be like, I don't like this.
[50:41.27]That's what's going to happen.
[50:45.05]Character sheet?
[50:47.67]Kill count, 83.
[50:51.51]Time played.
[50:53.11]More than I said I was going to stream.
[50:56.01]Chests opened.
[51:05.23]Wait till I get to a boss.
[51:12.76]What do you mean no bosses?
[51:21.57]Let me just get to a boss first before everybody freaks out.
[51:23.69]I mean, I'm not getting the essence for this, but whatever.
[51:30.55]Easy to get rid of them.
[51:36.27]This game's too violent for me.
[51:38.37]I'm sorry.
[51:38.75]This is what we're doing, though.
[51:44.24]Need more enemy variety.
[51:45.36]Well, hold on.
[51:46.06]It hasn't been very long.
[51:46.92]Oh, come on.
[51:52.12]Really?
[51:53.26]Breaking this will require some heavier tool.
[51:56.94]Oh, great.
[51:57.42]Can I go anywhere else?
[52:07.12]Wink.
[52:13.04]If you speak while playing a game, you're an E3 presenter.
[52:20.16]Alright, so I can't even talk, otherwise I'm an E3 presenter.
[52:33.11]Back down here?
[52:33.79]I can't even.
[52:39.85]guys I can go this way I can go this way remember if you say the thing you're doing you you're in blame the e3 gameplay fucking demos it's nothing to do with me pick up ooh
[53:12.61]Block?
[53:14.85]Ooh, that looks like a parry.
[53:18.92]That's a parry.
[53:21.12]That's absolutely a parry.
[53:23.10]Wink scam.
[53:28.19]You only got like three more days on that, by the way.
[53:48.26]Well, I didn't die, so that's good.
[53:53.56]Sell them now.
[54:01.81]I don't need you to jump.
[54:02.51]You just go... You walk up these.
[54:06.15]Can you get 5,000 points in three days?
[54:07.97]Probably.
[54:08.37]You'll probably be alright.
[54:14.48]This is not... Oh, this is not a heavier tool.
[54:20.18]Wait, this is not what I was supposed to do?
[54:22.11]A spear is not heavier than a sword.
[54:51.76]refuge I call this place a refuge with dark sarcasm it seems less dangerous than the fire pit below fire pit below you got it dark sarcasm tap right mouse button at the right time to parry you can parry unblockable attacks attacks marked with that icon cannot be parried alright nice
[55:21.06]That was fucking cool.
[55:24.68]It was really cool, actually.
[55:28.46]You gonna do something?
[55:40.15]What?
[55:43.07]How is that not a parry?
[55:46.95]Nice parry.
[55:49.03]I thought it was.
[55:59.71]What?
[56:04.72]OK.
[56:09.87]Why did it work that time?
[56:36.22]You were slightly too early.
[56:37.74]That's alright.
[56:38.22]Alright, I'm looking for a tool.
[56:42.91]A heavy tool.
[56:44.73]Well, are they fighting each other?
[56:46.11]Alright.
[56:48.09]There's a fucking scorpion down there.
[56:54.27]Alright, there's a...
[57:09.29]This is really confusing.
[57:10.79]So... Is it going to be later than this?
[57:23.02]Alright.
[57:26.12]Oh my god.
[57:32.78]MonkaS!
[57:34.63]Minus 300 viewers?
[57:36.24]Muggerhead!
[57:39.96]Ah!
[57:44.20]I thought it was a set piece!
[57:46.26]I thought it was a set piece.
[57:47.83]I thought it was a set piece.
[57:49.77]Oh well.
[57:52.01]I thought it was calcified or something.
[57:53.95]I don't know.
[57:54.27]I didn't think it was alive.
[58:14.28]There's only 500 viewers left?
[58:15.84]Shit!
[58:16.40]Fuck, I better play Risk of Rain!
[58:20.72]I better hurry up and get on that!
[58:34.04]Alright, don't die here.
[58:38.58]So, uh, I'm gonna have to parry this.
[58:41.00]These scorpions are fucking scary.
[58:42.32]Here we go, parry.
[58:44.46]That happens very quickly.
[58:45.58]Holy shit.
[58:46.66]I'm not supposed to be down here.
[58:47.60]I don't think I'm supposed to be down here.
[59:00.73]Holy shit.
[59:01.35]I'm not supposed to be down here.
[59:07.05]There's so many fucking scorpions.
[59:08.29]I'm not supposed to be down here.
[59:13.57]I'm hiding.
[59:18.92]Uh, is there a fountain?
[59:24.93]I'm definitely not supposed to be here.
[59:25.97]I need to find a tool.
[59:26.71]Okay, well.
[59:33.75]I'm up here.
[59:51.04]What?
[59:53.36]What?
[60:01.29]So am I not supposed to go down this way or something?
[60:03.97]I don't understand.
[60:04.51]Am I dying like one hit down here?
[60:14.14]Find a tool.
[60:27.09]Okay, that's better.
[60:32.80]Come on, I'm almost dead again.
[60:39.80]Did that guy just spawn?
[60:48.32]That was weird.
[60:55.46]Wink scam?
[60:57.20]God.
[61:01.17]It's getting deleted.
[61:02.35]Use them now.
[61:10.47]It's gone in less than 24 hours.
[61:27.02]I'm absolutely not supposed to be going down here.
[61:28.78]I'm already dead.
[61:39.77]Is there a different way to go besides... Hold on.
[61:45.55]Play funny jump game.
[61:46.71]No!
[61:50.35]No!
[61:50.87]There's a fountain right there!
[61:52.51]Why?! !
[62:03.58]I'm just keeping it on.
[63:06.29]I didn't even press any button!
[63:15.46]Stab each other!
[63:25.03]I killed it.
[63:25.45]Alright, now what?
[63:26.97]You don't have to parry every attack.
[63:32.03]If I don't, I'm gonna get hit and die.

[63:57.20]What's the funny word?
[63:58.40]What do you want me to say?
[64:03.16]Maybe getting hit and dying is a good thing.

[66:24.59]It's not a bad idea.
[66:26.35]King's Quest is pretty fun.
[66:27.21]People could, like, talk shit and stuff, and we could have, like, a fun back and forth about, like, what do I do?

[73:29.64]600 people left.
[73:30.10]It's my fault.

[73:35.90]Guys, for all you know, 600 people just got, like, a fucking call.
[73:38.77]And they had to get on a phone call.
[73:40.03]They had to go to, like, the doctor or something.
[73:41.55]Or they had to go and eat dinner.
[73:43.19]Or it was not to go to bed.
[73:44.67]You don't know it was my fault.
[73:45.83]I had nothing to do with it.
[73:46.61]600 people just got a phone call.
[73:57.77]Um, I can't get, I cannot get back up here, can I?
[74:00.25]That hurts so much.

[75:19.19]Not over here.
[75:23.71]Back to that boss door.

[75:32.38]They used the wrong fountain.
[75:37.39]There ain't nothing down here.

[77:06.85]Alright, pull these guys out.
[77:10.49]I'm about to pull more people too.
[77:22.27]Oh my god!
[77:54.95]Should I try to parry?
[78:23.85]Alright, you know what?
[78:24.45]I don't even care.
[78:25.17]Let's just go.
[78:25.93]Like, what the fuck?

[78:45.29]Why is there a third guy?
[79:03.80]Shit!
[79:04.84]There's nothing even in here.
[79:05.70]Alright, I gotta level up.
[79:13.33]Can I, like, sneak out of here?
[79:15.75]Nothing.
[79:22.84]Just check every crevice.
[79:23.82]Hold on.
[79:24.16]Alright, that counts as a boss.
[79:34.44]Is there another fountain up here?
[79:35.58]Oh, fuck.
[79:47.15]Oh my god, I'm in so much trouble now.
[79:49.88]I'm gonna die.
[79:56.62]Alright, well I know that my shit is over there.
[80:04.05]It's a full level up worth of stuff.
[80:13.36]Okay, we're good.
[80:13.92]Oops.
[80:54.05]I just sticky keyed.
[80:55.79]Wait, why are sticky keys on?
[80:57.23]Alright, I'm almost done with this game.
[81:04.57]I wanted to play it.
[81:06.25]It's fun.
[81:06.87]I just mauled it into sticky keys.
[81:22.57]No.
[81:27.94]No, no, no more.
[81:29.82]No.
[81:37.68]It's fun.
[81:39.20]Quick, get the fuck out of here.
[81:40.46]It's next to safe game, leave.
[81:44.07]God damn it.
