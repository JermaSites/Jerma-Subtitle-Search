[02:17.48]Yeah, uh... Hold on a second.
[02:22.65]Uh... I'll talk about it in a minute.

[02:51.54]So I have no pants on.
[02:54.71]I swear to God if I have to go back to the fucking doctor.
[02:56.55]I like burnt the shit out of my arm.
[02:59.35]Like a week and a half ago.
[03:03.95]Give me a minute.
[03:04.89]Hold on.
[03:06.17]I'm like stepping on nails and shit.
[03:07.85]I'll be right back.

[05:26.89]Okay, we're good.
[05:28.54]We're back.
[05:29.06]We're good.
[05:31.38]I put some antibacterial lightening cream on it.
[05:33.82]We'll be fine.
[05:34.80]Here we go.
[05:36.00]Let's play some... The game is potentially near and dear to my heart.
[05:40.44]Well, it is near and dear to my heart.
[05:41.65]Of course it is.
[05:43.73]It's Rat Simulator, man.
[05:46.81]And I know what you're thinking.
[05:48.09]Yeah, I know.
[05:48.93]This game's fucking stupid.
[05:50.45]This is not like a real...
[05:52.97]Here, I'm just going to turn this shit off, and we're going to turn this on.
[05:56.35]Here's, like, the funny music.
[05:58.90]Okay.
[05:59.48]Rat Simulator.
[06:01.04]Hopefully you can see it.
[06:03.10]I guess you can.
[06:03.88]Yeah, you can.
[06:04.78]You can see it.
[06:05.54]You guys are good.
[06:08.64]And here we go.
[06:11.66]So, I don't know anything about this game at all.
[06:14.83]Obviously, we're just going to play it.
[06:16.23]And, like, hold on.
[06:19.09]I need to add, like, a...
[06:21.80]Yeah, look at it.
[06:23.04]See?
[06:23.24]Rat Simulator.
[06:24.88]Look at the loud fucking noises.
[06:28.08]You guys know this is going to be like an iOS game.
[06:30.58]It's going to last like 15 minutes.
[06:32.00]Hold on.
[06:34.02]Give me... How do I do this?
[06:36.87]I need to move this out of the way.
[06:39.53]Okay, that's better.
[06:42.33]Let me just add this real quick.
[06:45.73]How do I do this?
[06:50.38]No, that's not what I wanted.
[06:53.09]That's not what I wanted.
[06:54.35]Here we go.
[07:00.95]Okay.
[07:01.49]Give me a minute.
[07:03.07]Give me a minute.
[07:09.61]Here we are.
[07:10.71]Okay.
[07:18.85]Here's a key.
[07:19.39]Let's do it.
[07:19.79]Here's a key.
[07:20.37]Okay.
[07:22.57]I'm gonna go with, like, uh, like, dash, or like, zero.
[07:29.88]Now let's see what happens when I do this.
[07:31.00]Uh, how about, like, Y. There, okay.
[07:37.34]So what happens when I do this?
[07:39.65]Here we go, ready?
[07:41.21]Oh, shit, you guys, oh, fuck, now you can't see anything.
[07:46.25]Okay, that works.
[07:48.23]Uh, thank you for joining me, everybody, on this glorious day.
[07:53.60]I'm finally going to get to play a fucking video game.
[07:55.50]I swear to God.
[07:56.24]One of these days.
[07:57.62]One of these days, I swear to God, we'll get to play, you know?
[08:00.13]Alright, play.
[08:04.17]Game crashed.
[08:04.73]Alright, select difficulty.
[08:05.61]We're just going to go with normal.
[08:10.13]How hard could it be?
[08:13.58]How difficult could this be?
[08:20.64]So there we are.
[08:23.38]You know, things are looking up.
[08:24.44]I heard a default AOL instant messenger sound.
[08:27.28]Hard!
[08:30.66]I should... Hold on.
[08:31.34]Let me turn this... This is, like, fucking loud.
[08:37.42]There.
[08:37.74]That's better.
[08:39.71]Voice volume?
[08:40.41]Alright, let's keep that kind of loud.
[08:41.61]Alright, so it looks like somebody left a couple of cheeseburgers on the ground here.
[08:47.57]Pick up.
[08:49.09]Press Q to throw an object.
[08:50.47]Rats would not... Huh?
[08:54.78]A rat would not, like, pick up a cheeseburger.
[08:56.71]A throw force, oh my god.
[08:58.73]Alright, well that's how you do that.
[09:06.07]I can pick up this vase.
[09:12.28]Look, I just, like, saw this on Steam and thought it would be, like, cute for, like, five minutes.
[09:15.70]Wow, that's a huge jump.
[09:17.04]Alright, like, how do I eat the cheese?
[09:18.98]F. F eats food.
[09:24.18]Can I eat the vase?
[09:25.12]No.
[09:29.46]Two out of two food eaten.
[09:30.90]Two out of two objects destroyed.
[09:34.74]How do you break shit?
[09:35.46]I don't understand.
[09:42.77]Whip it.
[09:44.77]Humans can detect doors opening or objects being destroyed.
[09:48.09]Okay, so what?
[09:51.65]Do I have to hide from the humans?
[09:55.94]I'm craving some chicken or beef right now.
[10:00.42]Enter the dining room.
[10:01.52]How do you interact?
[10:04.57]Here comes a human.
[10:05.35]You can press 1 to attack the human.
[10:08.97]Something tells me that's not the best idea.
[10:10.85]I'm gonna hide in the trash can and wait for him to come out.
[10:12.61]Where is he?
[10:16.01]What was that?
[10:18.41]What's that noise?
[10:20.27]Really?
[10:20.59]You're gonna do like... Maybe I should get some rest.
[10:22.46]Metal Gear Solid?
[10:24.32]Who's there?
[10:26.41]What's that noise?
[10:27.95]This really is like the fucking beginning of Rat Movie 2.
[10:29.83]What was that just now?
[10:31.99]Who's there?
[10:33.71]This guy's like losing his mind.
[10:36.09]What the fuck was that?
[10:36.73]Did I just shoot a gun?
[10:38.05]What's that noise?
[10:39.13]I saw something.
[10:41.72]No!
[10:43.88]Alright, this ain't no normal fucking rat.
[10:45.72]This ain't no... This isn't a normal rat, guys.
[10:48.90]He shoots like poison bullets.

[11:33.61]Time to exterminate and ruin your whole house.
[11:35.75]I guess I have to go to the dining room.
[11:42.33]I gotta break this dumb shit again.
[11:43.93]You guys think that I'm not interested right now.
[11:45.47]I am very interested.
[11:47.89]That that doesn't break.
[11:48.63]I love how that doesn't break.
[11:51.47]But literally anything else does.
[11:53.11]Like, seriously.
[11:53.71]Like, seriously.
[12:01.50]Add this to the collection of those simulator games that have jokey things in them.
[12:08.84]Okay.
[12:10.06]Press 1 to attack the human, and I gotta eat.
[12:12.04]Okay, we're gonna break more stuff and eat more food.
[12:13.84]Watch this.
[12:14.14]Ready?
[12:15.66]Eat his fucking mustard.

[12:37.56]Why?
[12:39.00]Gotta keep searching.
[12:40.14]There you are.
[12:41.28]Couldn't have escaped too far away.
[12:43.20]Alright, I gotta turn and use my rapid fire laser beam.
[12:54.16]God damn it.
[12:57.39]I'll get away, don't worry.
[12:59.15]Where's the rat?
[13:00.05]Wait, this is like a whole open world.
[13:02.93]Why are these people huge?
[13:04.37]It couldn't have escaped too far away.
[13:06.29]Alright, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[13:07.87]This is a lot more elaborate than I thought it was.
[13:09.87]This is a whole entire neighborhood.
[13:13.27]Ouch!
[13:14.43]Got him!
[13:15.01]Time to exterminate some rats!
[13:18.66]I wasn't paid enough to deal with this trouble.
[13:21.36]This is seriously just GTA with rats.
[13:23.10]This is so dumb.
[13:23.84]Can I go in somebody else's house?
[13:24.92]Time to exterminate some rats!
[13:28.12]I'm going in this person's house.
[13:36.17]I can't even go in here.
[13:38.47]Oh, that was a pretty nice escape.
[13:42.71]That was a pretty good escape.
[13:43.63]Oh, shit.
[13:43.91]Did I lose him?
[13:44.43]Somebody alert the postman!
[14:02.93]That noise is never gonna stop because I shot it into the sky, huh?
[14:05.29]Game sucks?
[14:07.35]Detection 100% It couldn't have escaped too far away, alright come on
[14:24.50]I'm gonna go eat three more pieces of food.
[14:26.58]Can I get in cars?
[14:27.04]Alright, hide under the car.
[14:27.70]Hey, hey guys!
[14:27.98]MLC Stealth is now playing Battlegrounds!
[14:29.04]I'm okay right here, I think.
[14:51.52]That rat must be around here somewhere.
[14:52.94]It couldn't have escaped too far away.
[14:54.50]I think I saw something.
[14:58.58]Gotta keep searching.
[15:00.28]How long does this last for?
[15:02.32]That rat must be around here somewhere.
[15:04.30]They're not gonna do this the whole time, are they?
[15:06.20]Is there, like, any way for this to go down?
[15:08.01]It couldn't have escaped too far away.
[15:10.01]That rat must be around here somewhere.
[15:11.95]Oh my god.
[15:13.73]Gotta keep searching.
[15:14.73]I really think that they're gonna do this forever.
[15:16.65]There's no way to find time to deal with this trouble.
[15:18.59]Now we're down to just alert status.
[15:22.63]At least I can see now.
[15:26.69]I have to, like, beat this game, guys.
[15:28.13]It's very important.
[15:33.77]I don't even think I'm going to find the house I was in.
[15:36.13]You're right.
[15:39.76]I'm not going to be able to find the house.
[15:42.37]Okay, we're at zero detection.
[15:43.45]If I knew what I was thinking, I would get punched in the face a lot.
[15:47.57]I think I'll take a vacation.
[15:50.03]That guy just said, if everybody knew what I was thinking, I'd get punched in the face a lot.
[15:57.85]People run very oddly in this game, by the way.
[16:00.30]And that means you deserve death!
[16:05.42]Back by escape!
[16:10.25]Alright, wait, wait.
[16:11.01]Dumpster.
[16:16.34]I think I'll take a vacation.
[16:20.04]I'm trying to break stuff.
[16:21.14]I want to get in the dumpster.
[16:22.16]No, I don't.
[16:22.62]Fuck it.
[16:22.92]Let's just go.
[16:23.34]Okay, fucking watch this.
[16:30.97]I'm going to whip a bag of trash at somebody.
[16:36.65]I'm gonna start a fight with this guy.
[16:39.59]I saw something.
[16:43.21]I saw something.
[16:44.66]Strange how paranoia can link up with... I must be seeing things.
[16:50.22]Oh wait, these people are... Okay, where's the house?
[16:52.52]Where's the house that I was in?
[16:53.64]I don't even know.
[16:54.41]I can't even... Does anybody remember what house I came out of?
[17:06.16]Was it this house?
[17:06.94]It might have been this one.
[17:08.48]No, I think it was double doors.
[17:10.52]Everyone talks like such a robot.
[17:19.97]Yeah, just like fucking played chicken with that guy.
[17:22.25]What's that noise?
[17:24.44]No, and they just appear out of nowhere.
[17:27.70]They just appear out of nowhere.
[17:29.22]That's fucking so stupid.
[17:31.65]Come on, at least have them come in like a shitty Pestman police car.
[17:35.65]No, no, I don't want to do this again.
[17:37.22]Please, just get in the house.
[17:38.86]Get in this fucking guy's house, quick.
[17:40.82]Good.
[17:41.08]Alright, this is the house, guys.
[17:45.83]This is the house.
[17:46.41]Let's just go to the gazebo.
[18:01.28]Okay, we're good.
[18:02.40]Shit.
[18:02.58]That's right, you see that fucking trick?
[18:10.93]I just got through the bars.
[18:12.15]This screen is so horrible, by the way.
[18:28.29]My goal this weekend is to move.
[18:30.43]Just enough so people don't think I'm dead.
[18:34.83]I believe I just did it.
[18:35.65]I did it.
[18:36.55]I don't know how I did it.
[18:40.51]Yeah, I win.
[18:41.59]We did it.
[18:41.95]Who's there?
[18:44.65]Is that my imagination?
[18:45.77]Alright, I need to break a couple more things in this guy's house.
[18:49.08]There's some cheese under the bed.
[18:49.96]Alright, that's two or three food cheeses he's eating.
[18:57.22]Dude, I have no sympathy for these people.
[19:01.62]You guys are leaving, like, blocks of cheese.
[19:04.86]Underneath your... Underneath your, like, entertainment plate, like, studio.
[19:09.09]Alright, brother, break a plate.
[19:11.21]That's a guaranteed breaking object, right?
[19:14.35]Apparently not.
[19:16.43]Pick it up.
[19:19.19]Like, this motherfucker has a fucking banana in his bed.
[19:21.47]Like, dude, you're gonna have, like, not just rats... Oh, goddammit, he hurt me.
[19:27.21]He's gonna come in this room.
[19:28.47]Here he comes.
[19:34.81]Eat shit!
[19:40.72]What?
[19:40.94]What?
[19:41.12]Wait, wait, why did he get back up?
[19:43.06]Why did he get, like, right back up?
[19:46.96]Oh my god.
[19:47.64]Alright, I need to, like, just start smashing stuff.
[19:54.05]Pick up, like, the sugar and tea and stuff.
[19:55.76]Just break it.
[19:56.30]Throw things.
[19:56.82]Break.
[19:58.02]Break.
[19:59.90]Break this!
[20:01.10]Oh my god.
[20:03.82]Bricks.
[20:06.10]Oh my god, nothing breaks!
[20:08.10]I can't fucking break anything!
[20:11.54]How do you break stuff?
[20:12.64]What the fuck, man?
[20:13.86]Like, I'm trying to smash things.
[20:15.44]Blue window.
[20:18.77]Gotta keep searching.
[20:21.07]Stop hiding and get back here.
[20:22.87]Damn it, no.
[20:23.91]That rat must be around here somewhere.
[20:39.30]There's speed running the fuck out of this right now.
[20:41.92]Go.
[20:52.24]I saw something.
[20:53.58]Now this guy has like an accent.
[20:57.63]What was that?
[20:58.35]Alright, almost there.
[21:00.45]Going good.
[21:02.55]What was that just now?
[21:04.89]More plates up here, break.
[21:05.77]What was that?
[21:06.49]I gotta jump around into the corner.
[21:09.75]What was that just now?
[21:13.45]Who's there?
[21:14.19]What was that?
[21:16.83]Was that my imagination?
[21:18.12]I can't, nothing breaks.
[21:19.64]I saw something.
[21:22.27]They keep changing who owns these houses.
[21:23.79]I must be tired.
[21:27.17]Alright, I need... No!
[21:30.67]What the fuck?
[21:33.03]Get out of the fucking way!
[21:34.68]Alright, honestly though... What else can you... What else can you break?
[21:45.19]I've yet to find something else that can break in this game, besides a vase.
[21:48.05]There's literally nothing else to break.
[21:52.76]There's like a stack of plates.
[21:55.24]And like, that's it.
[21:56.10]And I can't even open the door, I can't open the door.
[22:05.43]What's that noise?
[22:10.97]I can't pick it up.
[22:12.17]What's that noise?
[22:13.83]There's only like a certain amount of objects you can pick up in this game Now like here's like a plate pick up the plate and smash the damn thing I
[22:36.95]And then hide, because here he comes.
[22:38.26]Grab the glass off the table.
[22:39.62]Was that my imagination?
[22:41.42]He's going to walk in the door and be like, what happened?
[22:43.56]Oh, no.
[22:44.74]I'm a jacked guy that lives here now.
[22:53.27]This must be a timeshare.
[22:59.05]When will they finish that highway?
[23:05.15]See what I'm talking about?
[23:05.96]Like, why would this break?
[23:07.38]Just break!
[23:10.10]Okay.
[23:11.22]Enter living room.
[23:11.90]You got it.
[23:13.92]Rat simulator.
[23:18.52]This is not the living room.
[23:22.17]This is the bedroom.
[23:26.59]Get big or die trying.
[23:32.57]That's the name of the game, apparently.
[23:35.58]Alright, where is the living room?
[23:42.18]God.
[23:44.00]Fine, he'll come out here.
[23:44.96]That's good.
[23:49.31]Where's your living room?
[23:51.21]This is not a living room.
[23:54.13]This guy doesn't have a living room.

[24:37.53]These guys all have conversations with themselves.
[24:39.13]This guy's coming in the table right now.
[24:40.53]Alright, get out.
[24:45.55]Get out so I can eat this food in here.

[25:46.14]Don't make me kill this random fat guy running down this street.
[25:49.03]Okay, there we go.
[25:50.65]They're all gonna chase me outside.
[25:54.01]I'm gonna go around the back.
[25:54.81]This is just the first house, guys.
[26:03.97]There's much more house.
[26:05.17]There's like three more houses.
[26:06.41]Eventually I can drive a car.
[26:07.95]Really, like they can hear me open the doors.
[26:09.84]What was that just now?
[26:12.24]I have to just run by them.
[26:13.40]Like, they hear every time that I open the door.
[26:17.54]Look, if somebody opens a door in your house, you're not gonna hear it.
[26:22.70]You're never gonna hear that.
[26:24.14]What was that?
[26:24.84]I don't hear when every door is opened in my house.
[26:28.70]What was that?
[26:29.38]Like, where's this fucking banana?
[26:31.76]There's a carrot in the fireplace.
[26:33.74]Maybe I should get some rest.
[26:35.58]This is a good place for it, by the way.
[26:37.48]And now I'm stuck in here.
[26:38.34]I saw something.
[26:39.52]These guys are going to have to die.
[26:41.78]There's a banana and a piece of cheese.
[26:43.64]Where, though?
[26:47.28]No!
[26:48.85]Okay, bananas on the table.
[26:54.61]Where's the cheese?
[26:55.07]Where's the cheese?
[26:55.89]Right there.
[27:02.32]What the fuck was that?
[27:04.26]Somebody just threw a plate at me!
[27:05.34]Who just threw the plate?
[27:06.76]Oh, come on.
[27:07.10]I just gotta get the cheese and run out.
[27:10.92]Let me get, like, close enough to it.
[27:12.31]Eat the fucking cheese!
[27:13.81]He won't eat it!
[27:14.41]Uh...
[27:37.71]It's just more of this shit.
[27:39.38]Get me out of the house.
[27:41.20]Open the door!
[27:41.84]This place is infected with rats!
[27:45.22]Oh, and it's already said there's a rat in here?
[27:46.88]We're all standing in the room now with fucking flamethrowers!
[27:53.36]Alright, fuck this.
[27:53.90]We're just going for a ride.
[27:54.83]We're going to the other side of town.
[27:56.49]Where's the rat?
[28:01.63]We're going this way.
[28:02.41]Couldn't have escaped too far away.
[28:08.70]Okay, let me get... Next.
[28:13.56]Next.
[28:14.90]Next!
[28:17.07]Let me break into this person's house.
[28:20.29]Oh no, I'm not on my current objective.
[28:22.47]Alright, when I die here... Not next.
[28:25.97]Who the hell said not next?
[28:27.56]Probably.
[28:38.48]Alright, we're just going to see what's all the way to the end of the world here.
[28:46.17]Why is everybody so intent on burning one rat?
[28:49.39]I don't know.
[28:51.09]Well, actually, to be fair though, it seems like the rats in this county have poison laser beams that come out of their faces.
[28:58.60]This is it.
[29:02.48]This is the invisible wall.
[29:03.76]We got to the end of the game.
[29:06.52]Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Rat Simulator.
[29:12.57]I hope you enjoyed it.
[29:13.27]Let's see if we can get some long-range detonation on somebody.
[29:23.15]Come on, I gotta get somebody from like a hundred yards away.
[29:25.51]I gotta get this guy.
[29:35.24]Come on!
[29:35.76]We're through the hoop!
[29:38.24]Aw, dammit.
[29:42.04]Oh well, alright.
[29:44.96]Uh, that's- that's Rat Simulator.
[29:47.24]Thank you everybody for watching Rat Simulator, we're gonna move on now.
[29:51.20]And we are gonna move on, we're gonna- we're gonna continue Outlast.
[29:55.82]We're gonna play more Outlast!
[29:57.73]Eugh!
[30:00.33]Uh, cause yeah, if I've been figured out, I'll just keep playing it.
[30:03.13]Why not?
[30:06.59]Let's head back into Outlast.
[30:11.63]Outlast 2.
[30:14.78]Boo.
[30:15.20]Uh-oh, here come the boos.
[30:18.46]Hold on, I gotta have a really, really, really shitty title here.
[30:36.04]No, you guys are gonna love my title.
[30:45.67]Uh, feel the, uh, let's see.
[30:51.17]There.
[30:55.17]We want, how much longer do you think I can play that fucking game?
[31:03.94]Rat games or Riot?
[31:06.45]No, we're going to play Outlast for like an hour or two.
[31:09.56]I want to see like... Look, I had a lot of bad things to say.
[31:15.16]About Outlast.
[31:15.86]I was like, I don't like this game.
[31:17.86]It's too bad.
[31:18.38]It's boring.
[31:19.30]I'm going to give it another chance.
[31:22.09]So we're going to play Outlast.
[31:24.03]Give me... Give me a minute.
[31:26.47]Give me a minute while I switch games and get situated.
[31:30.67]I would say here's a good time for you to... I've got to put pants on.
[31:36.24]So I'm going to put pants on.
[31:39.92]I'll be back.
[31:40.80]See you guys in a minute.
