[00:01.43]You can turn me down.
[00:03.27]But anyone who's sitting in the chat, if they actually caught that first... I'd like to just be yelled at sometimes.
[00:29.77]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:32.37]Beep, bop, bop, bop.
[00:35.75]Hey, beep, bop.
[00:38.33]Mike is picking things.
[00:42.13]I did the smartest thing I've ever done.
[00:45.09]Set up and drill a hole.
[00:50.28]That is a good idea.
[00:50.84]I have, like, the perfect... Yeah, my mic is only picking up half the things.
[00:59.30]OK.
[01:02.30]Music.
[01:06.08]Oh, OK.
[01:28.24]My noise gate isn't... better.
[01:30.30]I don't know.
[01:31.06]I was messing around with my volume settings.
[01:32.84]Nice work!
[01:37.29]That seems like that'll be better.
[01:38.67]I don't know.
[01:40.29]Yeah, that seems good.
[01:41.03]I think something was pulling on my Scarlet Solo, and it's all whacked out.
[01:46.45]I think that's fine.
[01:48.49]You have to invite me to the game or whatever.
[01:53.54]Hopefully I kept your progress.
[01:55.52]Yeah, hopefully.
[02:00.48]You, uh, you tell me.
[02:03.20]This is lagging, like, like, volume so bad.
[02:10.57]Did it keep your progress?
[02:13.35]Um... Well, I'm still an anime girl, so I'm gonna assume yes.
[02:16.23]I don't know why I have this axe.
[02:18.53]I guess they give you a random starting weapon.
[02:20.70]Problem.
[02:29.30]Okay.
[02:30.32]Okay.
[02:31.80]But yeah, I just died, so I don't have anything.
[02:35.13]And you just died.
[02:36.93]Yeah, we are penniless at the moment.
[02:39.17]Trustworthy people in the chat, let me know about the audio settings, because I haven't lived here for more than a week yet, and I haven't had a computer for more than, like, two days.
[02:50.65]So I don't really know what's up with this.
[02:55.34]Yep.
[02:55.50]I think the game's a little loud.
[03:00.49]I can't really judge these things.
[03:04.20]Let's go.
[03:04.64]Are you ready to play the video game?
[03:06.74]I am ready to play.
[03:07.66]Oh, dude, Lich King!
[03:10.82]I don't see you wearing any interesting clothing.
[03:14.21]I'm serious.
[03:14.83]I don't like the anime girl.
[03:16.79]I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be this.
[03:20.01]No, that was... Weren't you just this guy?
[03:23.22]Yeah.
[03:24.62]But, no, that was the Santa Claus.
[03:27.14]I just didn't have the football helmet on.
[03:28.54]Or the giant... Oh, now we're both Santa.
[03:30.72]Santa's the best one!
[03:31.78]He is.
[03:33.10]You have to unlock the other ones.
[03:34.80]That's the whole point of the game.
[03:36.69]So, I'm... Okay, am I your son?
[03:39.67]Would the son be better?
[03:40.89]I'm your son.
[03:41.67]You have the gray hair.
[03:42.89]I have the Wolverine hair.
[03:45.83]And I need a hat.
[03:49.35]Can I... Can I just be over here and put a hat on?
[03:52.63]I like that one.
[03:56.84]I don't like any of them.
[03:58.60]That's why I wasn't wearing any.
[04:00.45]Oh, no, that makes me look muscular.
[04:02.35]Yeah, you go down to the ones you unlock.
[04:03.59]You unlock hats.
[04:04.71]I got that one.
[04:05.93]I unlocked the football helmet.
[04:08.91]I just look like one of the three Vikings.
[04:11.71]Yeah.
[04:12.97]That's an old Blizzard game that nobody cares about anymore, huh?
[04:15.93]Yeah, but they still put in Heroes of the Storm.
[04:19.24]Let's go.
[04:20.64]Okay.
[04:21.86]I'll do this one.
[04:23.88]Hold on.
[04:24.16]Yeah, I'm going to alt-tab real quick.
[04:25.60]My game's going to...
[04:27.93]Why you, what are you doing?
[04:29.11]Don't worry about it.
[04:30.05]Just making sure everything is right on my other monitor.
[04:32.97]Do you ever have this thing where you like open up a game and all of your windows turn like black?
[04:36.71]Like I just did it again in my chat, just like turn black.
[04:40.50]Um, sometimes.
[04:42.20]Alright, can we not, let's uh, a couple of ground rules.
[04:45.60]Let's not D2 everything.
[04:47.60]Okay?
[04:49.27]This just looks suspicious.
[04:51.71]That's all it is?
[04:52.37]So you get the gold and I get the murky one.
[04:54.93]No, let's go in the next area and I'll drink it.
[04:57.23]Well, I don't know.
[04:59.41]What if it's bad?
[05:00.65]What if it is bad?
[05:01.23]You might just kill the run.
[05:02.15]Oh, I'm drinking it.
[05:05.08]Weak bones.
[05:06.02]Okay, that was... I'm glad I did that.
[05:11.08]I'll take care of the big guy.
[05:12.08]Big guy versus big guy.
[05:17.36]You know...
[05:19.23]Uh, big guy's kicking my ass.
[05:21.67]We, like, just started and I've already got weak bones.
[05:25.03]I told you you shouldn't have drank it.
[05:26.83]We, like, usually deal with this guy well.
[05:29.29]I'm gonna die.
[05:29.73]Well, cause last time I had stones to throw at him.
[05:31.67]We always had something to throw at him.
[05:34.51]You're fucking kidding me.
[05:36.27]Let's restart.
[05:37.07]You know what, this- No, seriously, seriously, like, you, that guy, we should- Uh, hey guys, welcome to the stream.
[05:46.44]We're checking out the new game.
[05:48.62]Hey, watch this go, oh my god, so funny!
[05:50.00]I can hit you!
[05:50.60]We can hit each other!
[05:51.36]Hey, wait, no, wait, wait, friend!
[05:52.52]Wait, friend!
[05:53.38]Look, we can hit each other!
[05:54.56]Alright.
[05:56.56]Will you get over here?
[05:57.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:59.51]The free gold.
[06:00.83]That was a bad first room.
[06:02.49]That was a bad first room.
[06:03.39]That was bad.
[06:04.21]It's randomly generated, you guys, and you beat people up, and it's very scary, because you die.
[06:11.19]The reach on this weapon is insane.
[06:12.55]I have already taken 30 points of damage.
[06:15.81]Which is not good.
[06:18.76]I gotta play the barbarian.
[06:20.01]I can reach so far with this sword.
[06:22.83]I wish I could.
[06:24.35]Well, there you go.
[06:24.77]There's a sandwich.
[06:25.87]I'm doing it.
[06:27.52]You wanna do it?
[06:28.08]You just... Get out of the way.
[06:30.54]I'm doing it.
[06:33.40]Flawless.
[06:34.41]Flawless.
[06:35.89]So we've only done, like, one run of this game so far.
[06:38.79]So anyone who doesn't know what's going on, you'll figure it out.
[06:41.95]So what does that do?
[06:42.89]Gives jumping disease.
[06:44.01]But if you overcome it, you get double jump, and I think there was an achievement for that as well.
[06:47.67]Okay, so you take every item.
[06:49.41]Okay, good.
[06:50.25]Because I didn't get one thing from that.
[06:52.14]Alright, watch out.
[06:54.54]This is the drugs room.
[06:55.60]Be careful.
[06:57.68]We don't know exactly what this thing does yet.
[06:59.64]But he dropped an item last time we hit him.
[07:01.96]So only one of us hit him, so we don't both take drugs at the same time.
[07:06.14]I didn't get drugged last time.
[07:08.78]I did.
[07:10.50]Oh.
[07:11.34]Well, I've already got jumping disease.
[07:12.94]I might as well be, like, the handicapped loser this run.
[07:16.68]Be careful.
[07:18.16]He's spitting out the drug juice.
[07:22.74]What's going on?
[07:23.18]What's wrong with me?
[07:23.68]I don't know.
[07:24.68]What's wrong with you?
[07:25.26]Why is there an arrow pointing down?
[07:28.10]There's an arrow pointing on me, too.
[07:29.24]It's just pointing at you.
[07:30.38]Oh, is that what it is?
[07:32.98]I thought it meant, like, attack down.
[07:34.96]I just got two achievements.
[07:37.12]And I got Barbarian class.
[07:39.04]Do you want to, like, go back and I can change to Barbarian?
[07:41.48]Just beat the bag out of that thing.
[07:43.10]Until he drops stuff so I can get it.
[07:45.63]And now I'm drunk, too.
[07:47.13]More.
[07:47.33]Hit him more.
[07:49.71]He's going to drop an item.
[07:54.95]No, he was just dropping gold.
[07:56.21]Okay, let's go.
[07:57.45]Okay, so I'm drunk.
[07:59.21]I have weak arms.
[08:01.01]And half health.
[08:02.87]Can I go back and be a barbarian, please?
[08:04.99]Don't you just wish I was a fucking... You were a barbarian like me?
[08:08.03]No.
[08:11.07]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:14.64]Bye.
[08:15.26]What do these things do?
[08:16.50]Get these bombs?
[08:17.46]Alright, get a bomb.
[08:18.86]On the count of three, we're gonna throw a bomb at the same time.
[08:21.18]One.
[08:23.15]Good.
[08:24.06]Real good.
[08:25.14]I'm drunk!
[08:26.64]I can't walk in a straight line!
[08:28.38]Oh, good luck.
[08:30.00]I almost germed off the bridge.
[08:33.30]Do not do that.
[08:37.22]Which is exactly what you did.
[08:38.95]I'm gonna die.
[08:40.37]I want to die.
[08:45.48]We have to strategically kick them off.
[08:48.24]I can't strategically do anything.
[08:49.68]I'm drunk and I randomly jump.
[08:52.44]I'm jumping in random directions.
[08:54.22]Just get out of the way.
[08:57.82]I'm going to die.
[08:58.64]See?
[08:59.02]He's an idiot.
[08:59.48]He just fell off by himself.
[09:00.46]Nobody even had anything to do with that.
[09:02.17]Okay, you play the game.
[09:06.07]Watch out for that knife.
[09:06.69]Alright.
[09:10.53]So, who's going to open the chest?
[09:12.57]Because whoever gets the damage from the chest is dead.
[09:14.37]I would like to die.
[09:20.53]Oh, Frostbolt.
[09:22.57]Chill out, chill out.
[09:24.55]You got Frostbolt?
[09:25.27]Come get this.
[09:27.37]Oh, no, this heals you for 15, gives you a random disease.
[09:30.51]Totally mine.
[09:31.11]I want to be the most diseased person in the game.
[09:33.91]Well, get this.
[09:34.49]This thing is like spell damage.
[09:37.17]I can't even see you.
[09:39.34]Alright, yeah, get that, because now you have plus 5 spell damage.
[09:43.00]You're just a drunk mage.
[09:44.26]There's a scroller freeze here as well.
[09:46.12]Up here, you take that.
[09:47.16]I'm assuming that's like a one-time use.
[09:49.94]I would assume, yeah.
[09:50.86]I'm a tiny, weak-armed, drunk, jumping midget dwarf from a forgotten Blizzard game that no one cared about but pretended they cared about for like a week.
[10:00.97]Oh, I can drink this.
[10:02.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:04.93]Let's compare our swing ranges.
[10:06.07]Swing.
[10:06.51]Wait a minute.
[10:06.93]Take that.
[10:09.80]Wow.
[10:11.40]You're welcome.
[10:13.48]Welcome back to the real world.
[10:15.00]Strats.
[10:18.14]Alright, you ready?
[10:20.30]Wait, I'm gonna get this stone.
[10:22.66]Don't leave me hanging up here.
[10:23.66]Watch out for those... Did you just do that?
[10:32.17]Yeah, I got the frost orb.
[10:34.57]That's why you gave me the smell power.
[10:35.71]Do you remember?
[10:36.39]Oh yeah!
[10:39.41]And I've been picking up all... How much gold do you have? 31.
[10:43.61]Oh, I have 30 as well.
[10:45.71]We're okay.
[10:51.77]Fuck you.
[10:52.95]I'm sorry, my arms are too big.
[11:04.00]I'm not a tiny baby man anymore.
[11:06.18]I want to pick up these mushrooms.
[11:11.06]I like dying, though.
[11:13.26]You take it.
[11:16.92]Well, this is the first area.
[11:18.78]We're done with the first area.
[11:21.66]Does this heal you?
[11:22.34]I don't remember.
[11:23.66]I don't think it does.
[11:25.81]Like, getting to the next area doesn't heal you.
[11:28.13]No, it doesn't.
[11:29.89]Actually, it might.
[11:30.53]Maybe, like, five or ten.
[11:31.59]I don't know.
[11:37.51]I think this is one of those games, too, where every time you've had, like, way more kills than me.
[11:42.88]Yeah, I mean... This is just one of those games.
[11:45.08]Watch out.
[11:45.90]We have never seen it.
[11:47.57]I'm doing it.
[11:48.19]I'm doing it.
[11:49.07]Freeze.
[11:50.51]Two giants?
[11:51.21]Are you kidding me?
[11:51.85]Kill the giants as fast as you can.
[11:54.31]They're going to ruin this whole thing.
[12:00.78]Whatever.
[12:01.08]Just trade.
[12:04.83]You can air juggle the giants.
[12:07.03]I know, but it's hard to do that when there's another guy.
[12:11.87]I'm just going to open this chest over here.
[12:13.41]Oh, no, no, you're not.
[12:14.33]No, you're not.
[12:15.52]You're going to make sure we don't die here.
[12:17.42]I have one HP.
[12:19.94]He has a golden ear.
[12:25.48]Oh, come on.
[12:26.14]Really?
[12:26.88]Really?
[12:29.99]That really did suck.
[12:30.99]That was stupid.
[12:32.33]I thought you had that under control and he jumped over and killed me.
[12:36.44]Rue's diseases.
[12:37.50]The way this works, everyone, is when he dies I have to kill ten things and he like eats their souls and he stops being a ghost but he can still hit me and other things for like one damage.
[12:47.18]Please don't knock me off.
[12:48.17]I'm gonna... I knew you were gonna go for it.
[12:56.19]They needed to see.
[12:56.91]It was possible.
[13:01.26]Don't!
[13:01.74]Come on!
[13:02.58]We've already gone through these jokes, now you have an audience.
[13:05.52]So you just have to like- FUCK!
[13:07.94]I'm paranoid!
[13:08.86]I didn't do anything.
[13:10.38]I didn't touch you, I'm not touching you.
[13:12.18]I'm not- are we on vacation?
[13:17.31]Yeah, we're in the backseat of a Winnebago.
[13:19.11]There's a lot of stuff there, and I'm jealous that I can't take it.
[13:25.65]Scroll removes all your curses.
[13:28.51]That's like the same thing... Oh, apparently curses are... Ooh, look at that thing.
[13:33.88]Ooh, 13 damage.
[13:35.80]And the magic banana.
[13:37.12]This is all mine.
[13:38.20]Like, maybe you shouldn't have died, loser.
[13:40.78]Removes your curses.
[13:42.08]Well, pick it up.
[13:43.64]I can't, I already have something.
[13:45.76]Kill nine things.
[13:46.86]Hurry up.
[13:47.84]What was this guy's name again?
[13:48.86]Uh, Danny Trejo.
[13:51.16]Yeah.
[13:53.78]Oh yeah, the guy from your, um... It's the Danny Trejo enemy.
[14:01.34]Mmm, souls.
[14:04.16]Are you gonna die?
[14:05.26]Oh.
[14:07.20]See, look, as a ghost I can help.
[14:08.52]I can whack people for one damage.
[14:16.36]That's really helpful.
[14:17.52]Like, dude's really helping over there.
[14:24.24]You know, if you're gonna be a dick, you know, don't be a dick.
[14:28.47]Get him!
[14:33.03]I was trying to hit him, I promise.
[14:36.65]How many more?
[14:38.41]Come back after four.
[14:40.91]Should be a shop or something soon.
[14:43.89]Hope so.
[14:48.26]Let's come back and do whatever that is when you're alive.
[14:52.98]Whoa, that didn't freeze half of them.
[15:10.57]one more.
[15:10.81]Yes, I am back.
[15:14.83]I'm a barbarian.
[15:20.15]I want to know why you got barbarian link.
[15:21.65]It's probably based on kills or something.
[15:25.80]I played this game for like probably half an hour or 20 minutes or something before you did.
[15:29.90]Oh, that's true, because I had to confirm that my address exists.
[15:35.35]Oh, I had a funny joke.
[15:36.85]I'll tell you the funny joke later.
[15:38.09]I took the axes.
[15:40.29]Okay, let's go back to the skeleton, man.
[15:42.64]What are the knives?
[15:44.68]Massive damage on one person.
[15:46.02]I assume maybe if you killed him there would be repercussions.
[15:56.51]I don't know.
[15:57.49]It's just a skeleton.
[15:59.99]It's just a skeleton.
[16:13.76]Ooh, something fell out.
[16:15.38]Healing potion.
[16:16.48]Oh, there's like a tavern there.
[16:18.02]Like, once we kill these guys, we can go play Hearthstone.
[16:23.36]Watch out, I'm gonna get him.
[16:26.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[16:27.14]Actually, watch out now.
[16:30.55]Oh, I got the axes.
[16:31.65]You can just fucking crush everyone.
[16:33.41]That guy's a chump.
[16:37.41]Let's go play Hearthstone.
[16:38.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[16:40.73]Murky water.
[16:41.33]Actually, you take this.
[16:43.42]I'll drink the... I'll drink the dirty water.
[16:47.21]Well, we'll see.
[16:47.93]Well, you can take that now.
[16:49.53]That cures diseases.
[16:51.05]If you want to do it right away.
[16:51.89]I don't... I don't think I want it.
[16:53.07]Alright.
[16:54.63]You want to be tiny guy?
[16:55.51]Let's go tavern brawl.
[16:57.19]Ooh, wait.
[16:57.92]Haunted him.
[16:58.58]Might as well.
[16:59.10]I gotta... I gotta be big for this and scare the shit out of this guy.
[17:01.44]Intimidate him.
[17:02.70]Dude, no.
[17:03.10]He's playing... He's playing cards.
[17:05.08]Well, it really is a card game.
[17:05.98]Those are three wisps.
[17:08.22]What do you do?
[17:09.04]Pay 13 gold for a game of cards.
[17:12.35]See, what did I tell you?
[17:13.60]Okay, here we go.
[17:14.15]I'm doing it.
[17:14.53]I have no idea what any of this means.
[17:18.47]Uh, the devil is really good in, uh, Victor Ryan.
[17:22.35]Can you see this on the screen?
[17:23.37]Yeah.
[17:24.59]Uh... Far right, far right, far right!
[17:26.88]No, no, no, you can't be all the way.
[17:28.16]Yes!
[17:28.60]No, it is, it is.
[17:29.56]Oh.
[17:31.12]You gotta be somewhere, like, in the middle.
[17:34.30]Uh...
[17:36.16]Right in the middle.
[17:37.53]Serpent.
[17:38.51]I knew it.
[17:39.19]Wait, I keep going.
[17:39.61]I gave you an item.
[17:40.65]I can take it because you're still doing this.
[17:43.11]What does it do?
[17:44.05]It freezes enemies.
[17:44.95]I don't know.
[17:46.81]I'm assuming that it's kind of you.
[17:49.93]Maybe I'll lose it all.
[17:50.93]I don't know.
[17:51.55]We'll go this one.
[17:53.78]Alright.
[17:54.10]That's a healing potion.
[17:55.20]There's got to be a negative.
[17:56.92]Far right.
[18:00.16]Oh.
[18:01.96]Dude didn't want to go far right.
[18:03.70]Can you just like stop?
[18:06.73]Why would you?
[18:07.31]This is insane!
[18:09.09]Oh shit, I got the devil!
[18:15.18]Who even cares?
[18:17.10]I don't care.
[18:17.56]Dude, for frame of reference everyone, we found like a shop before and it was like 80 gold for like 1% of what he just got for 13 gold.
[18:26.57]Unless we just got really lucky.
[18:29.91]Maybe you did, I mean you got the devil dead last.
[18:33.86]Oh, I got an axe, too.
[18:35.56]Ah, got your sword.
[18:37.48]How much more damage does this do?
[18:40.40]Actually, Gladius does more.
[18:43.26]His anvil is alive, by the way.
[18:46.97]That's a table.
[18:48.19]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[18:48.89]Wait, wait, how much... Let me see this.
[18:52.67]Okay, that does more damage.
[18:53.59]That one has more reach, though.
[18:55.11]Is that better for you?
[18:56.09]The longer?
[18:56.85]No, I have 13 damage on the sword.
[19:00.50]Yeah, whatever.
[19:01.16]Okay.
[19:01.56]Well, that was a fun card game to give me.
[19:04.52]What just happened?
[19:07.14]What did I just do to you?
[19:08.88]I think you're Santa Claus.
[19:09.82]You're familiar.
[19:10.48]Just, like, tried to frost you.
[19:12.67]Oh, yeah, he did.
[19:13.81]He does the random frost.
[19:14.95]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:16.45]There's more?
[19:19.81]Oh, don't do it!
[19:20.57]Don't do it!
[19:21.95]Don't do it!
[19:22.87]It just... It cures all diseases, but it's the fucking drunk that's the worst disease in the game.
[19:28.63]I don't get that.
[19:30.37]I want to get rid of my disease.
[19:32.77]Give me something way worse.
[19:36.87]Don't drink, guys.
[19:38.29]My character's really good now, by the way.
[19:39.83]Yeah, I noticed, because you got all of that shit.
[19:42.32]I have 70 gold, by the way, so if we find a shop, maybe I'll actually get an item.
[19:50.42]What is this?
[19:51.16]There's something right above us.
[19:52.10]I don't know what that is, but it's some kind of door.
[19:55.48]That seemed like the same door that was like the...
[19:59.20]Big chest.
[19:59.96]Yeah.
[20:01.48]Chest room.
[20:03.54]Eat shit.
[20:04.80]Thank God there's no friendly fire.
[20:06.74]That would be so bad.
[20:07.90]Yeah, it would.
[20:10.36]Oh, it's a bunch of these things.
[20:13.46]I couldn't tell which one I was.
[20:14.48]I looked like them.
[20:15.80]They're all box people!
[20:16.86]Yeah, this is really bad.
[20:17.69]And I'm drunk!
[20:21.15]We might actually, like, die here.
[20:25.39]Use your spells!
[20:28.89]There we go.
[20:29.69]Side to side.
[20:30.15]This is the technique I'm telling you.
[20:34.79]Just stay out of the way.
[20:35.43]I don't want to, like, stun lock you in this.
[20:37.35]I'm dead.
[20:37.97]No, I'm not.
[20:38.27]There's a- there's a potion on the ground to heal.
[20:44.76]I already have a good potion.
[20:45.76]You take that.
[20:47.70]I wanna die!
[20:48.46]I'm drunk!
[20:51.09]How do you cure being drunk?
[20:52.77]What's, like, the cure for drunk?
[20:53.91]I think there was, like, an elfin potion that cured all.
[20:56.93]Oh.
[20:57.37]That I drank earlier.
[20:58.67]Or I gave to you.
[20:59.25]I don't remember what happened to it.
[21:00.41]I think I took it.
[21:00.99]Still spawning enemies on us, really?
[21:09.42]You can pick people up, too, by the way.
[21:10.58]You just do, like, the... We haven't been doing it.
[21:14.24]Seems pretty useful.
[21:18.38]Can we knock at anything from that?
[21:19.91]We just got a room full of boxes.
[21:21.43]That was... I don't know how much health this heals, but you need... No, no, no.
[21:26.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:28.70]You take it.
[21:29.88]No, no.
[21:30.42]I already have a good one.
[21:31.18]That's what I'm saying.
[21:32.12]Like, I have this one.
[21:33.00]So drink mine and then hold on to yours.
[21:36.56]Alright, well, give it to me.
[21:39.16]Yeah.
[21:40.60]Hold on to mine.
[21:43.64]He says.
[21:43.96]I said it ironically.
[21:51.28]I don't like these enemies.
[21:52.88]Too easy to hide.
[21:53.92]Oh, take the dart if you don't have a throwable.
[22:01.93]Oh, we can just leave.
[22:02.63]Do you want to just, like, go to the next area?
[22:04.43]I don't know.
[22:06.71]What if they drop stuff?
[22:08.63]Like cash.
[22:09.41]I don't know.
[22:12.80]Oh, we win.
[22:13.08]Oh, yeah.
[22:15.85]You have more people killed than me this night.
[22:17.47]A lot more.
[22:18.67]I was dead.
[22:19.77]We had the same damage dealt, but I killed like 10 more.
[22:22.57]Whatever.
[22:23.39]I was dead.
[22:29.09]Really?
[22:30.95]That's the stupidest enemy.
[22:34.31]They come out of the ground, too.
[22:35.95]They're not like just lamps that were there in disguise.
[22:39.00]Are they the most jacked out of all the enemies in the game that are inanimate objects?
[22:43.34]I don't know.
[22:47.29]Candlesticks are the ones that have the gigantic arms.
[22:52.73]Ooh.
[22:53.33]Yeah, like these orcs don't have that big of arms.
[22:56.39]Watch out.
[22:56.75]Well, that was a challenge.
[23:07.09]I'm just gonna throw them down the drainpipe.
[23:09.79]Okay, whatever is in here is mine, because you're jacked as hell.
[23:14.90]That's mine.
[23:16.42]You know, if you can open it, maybe.
[23:19.14]These are way harder than they look, by the way.
[23:22.06]Oh, Jellybean, what does that do?
[23:25.56]That's never gonna happen.
[23:28.28]I'm taking this because I'm the big, giant guy, and I should... Whatever is in here, I get.
[23:33.88]Also, I'm taking the best thing that came out.
[23:35.86]No, I get it, because for thematic purposes, I'm the big guy, and it wouldn't look right on you.
[23:40.26]That's true.
[23:40.70]You are a big guy.
[23:42.80]Is this... Oh.
[23:44.02]Plus 10 vitality.
[23:46.78]A random disease, but heals for 50.
[23:52.18]Are you still drunk?
[23:53.86]No.
[23:54.42]No, I'm not.
[23:55.06]Wow.
[23:55.50]Because we completed the level, I guess.
[23:57.39]Oh, okay.
[23:59.65]Is that better than what you have on?
[24:01.31]The axe?
[24:01.93]Yeah.
[24:02.73]No, no.
[24:03.87]No, no, like that one.
[24:05.21]That axe sucks.
[24:06.93]So, I was using the bad weapon.
[24:11.56]See, everything in here is yours.
[24:12.54]I'll let you get all that.
[24:16.14]Thanks.
[24:20.41]Alright, everything in there is yours.
[24:21.53]How does that sound?
[24:25.09]I'll even... I'll even open it for you.
[24:26.91]Gonna make me fight the jacked-ass leprechaun.
[24:35.44]Why did I call him a leprechaun?
[24:36.62]I don't know.
[24:37.96]Why did you call him a leprechaun?
[24:39.20]Remember how I said everything in there was yours?
[24:42.48]I accidentally picked things up because I'm too big.
[24:45.16]Um, I have to fart.
[24:47.34]We've been really loud.
[24:48.84]Don't do it.
[24:49.68]I'm not.
[24:51.53]Oh no, not that guy.
[24:52.77]And watch out.
[24:53.23]These are spikes, Jerma, by the way.
[24:55.15]I was trying to leave the room.
[25:00.63]God.
[25:04.32]I don't know what to do here.
[25:06.44]That killed a lot of them.
[25:08.00]It did.
[25:08.26]Ooh, there's spikes everywhere.
[25:12.80]These guys are coming alive.
[25:14.10]GG.
[25:15.88]I think that's it.
[25:16.32]I think this game over.
[25:16.92]No, I think I can handle this.
[25:22.68]I'm trying to just get the... Dude, I'm crushing it.
[25:29.34]Dude, you talking about GG over there?
[25:31.38]Ow.
[25:31.68]These spikes suck.
[25:36.18]I'm dead.
[25:36.42]I got locked in the corner.
[25:38.28]Yeah, it's a good thing you got all the items.
[25:40.87]You just have to kill ten people.
[25:41.93]It's easy.
[25:42.77]You said I got this.
[25:47.59]What a horrible room.
[25:49.55]There's a bomb guy in here, too.
[25:50.95]Um, I have a disease that means I can't stop running.
[26:00.84]Any other room that, like, didn't have spikes on it, maybe that would be okay.
[26:04.18]Oh, there's, like, a lot of health on the ground.
[26:05.26]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[26:06.16]Check this out.
[26:07.06]This guy has, like, no health.
[26:08.08]His bomb.
[26:10.26]He didn't explode.
[26:10.96]Why did he not explode?! !
[26:13.38]Oh, because a ghost hit him.
[26:14.50]You're not real.
[26:15.88]That's bullshit.
[26:16.76]He should have exploded.
[26:17.60]Oh, these guys have fucking poison blades.
[26:27.30]Oh, turn the other way, you dickhole.
[26:29.83]Oh, these spikes!
[26:32.37]I'm helping.
[26:34.55]Jerma, I can't stop running!
[26:37.68]I don't know what to tell you.
[26:39.16]If you kill... Miss Spikes!
[26:41.20]That room sucked, and it's all your fault that you died.
[26:44.52]Well, I can start as a Barbarian, man.
[26:47.19]Yeah, you can.
[26:48.43]Although, I don't know, it's... It doesn't even seem that good, because the sword does, like, five damage.
[26:53.55]What else have we done here?
[26:55.65]Adventurer, Barbarian... How do you get Double Jump?
[27:05.58]Uh, you have to drink that Double Jump potion.
[27:08.93]And then I guess not die with it.
[27:11.63]This is a challenge, man.
[27:18.51]Opened a bunch of chests.
[27:21.63]Just give me booty.
[27:23.23]So we have to pick up gold and open chests to be able to unlock the pirate.
[27:29.27]So we haven't been doing that?
[27:31.39]I mean, we have.
[27:31.91]It just takes a while, I guess.
[27:34.37]I want to be like a battle mage.
[27:36.03]I want to play Battle Balloon.
[27:44.87]Win the game in less than 30 minutes.
[27:46.35]Apparently.
[27:50.19]Eh.
[27:52.51]I guess there's an ending to this.
[27:55.03]Okay, whatever.
[27:55.51]Let's go.
[27:57.09]No, I don't like my hat.
[27:58.77]Maybe change it.
[27:59.79]One day we'll know what the alchemist does.
[28:01.23]Come on.
[28:10.30]Come on.
[28:10.88]Come on.
[28:11.26]Okay, I like this one.
[28:11.96]Looks like I'm about to go to bed.
[28:14.61]Aren't you?
[28:17.13]We're both barbarians.
[28:19.60]Chop the tree down.
[28:24.62]Okay, try and not take, like, damage.
[28:26.65]Use your range to your advantage.
[28:30.77]Barbarians are slow.
[28:34.55]Yeah, and don't feel like you have to, like, mash and, like, you know, dodge around.
[28:38.54]Do some dodging.
[28:39.54]Dude, yeah, do some dodging, guys.
[28:41.24]Pick up some rocks.
[28:42.76]A couple of hits.
[28:43.92]Dodge around.
[28:44.50]There's no reason to.
[28:45.24]This is not, like, a beat-em-up.
[28:46.92]I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[28:49.04]We need to stay alive.
[28:49.52]Leave that hamburger there.
[28:51.36]Leave it.
[28:51.80]This is a survival beat-em-up.
[28:54.52]Exactly.
[28:56.05]Don't touch it.
[28:56.87]I want it.
[28:57.13]Don't get too greedy.
[28:59.11]Focus on the task at hand.
[29:07.10]Ow!
[29:07.26]You just took half your health.
[29:09.28]I got lightning bolted for being greedy.
[29:12.57]I'm gonna go get that hamburger.
[29:16.37]It gave me 5% crit chance.
[29:19.01]Oh, that's a pretty big deal.
[29:21.55]I think it was 5.
[29:23.20]And then Stonehenge, like, shot me.
[29:26.18]Maybe that's what that means.
[29:27.16]It's just, here, you can have this item, but you're gonna take 50% of your health.
[29:33.83]if not just like a flat 40 or whatever.
[29:36.15]I'm like... Can you handle this guy or what?
[29:41.51]He keeps trying to shoot you and he walks up to like a different area.
[29:45.56]I would just... Get... You take it.
[29:47.52]Get him.
[29:53.82]I feel like this does something.
[29:54.64]Does this game have music?
[29:56.76]I think I turned it down.
[29:59.28]Because it was kind of loud.
[30:01.81]5% volume on the music is... Isn't this kind of loud, everyone?
[30:05.81]Yes or no?
[30:06.41]I'm going to play.
[30:10.05]Am I going to stream tomorrow and be a bit more talkative to the chats?
[30:14.25]I get that.
[30:14.93]I get that.
[30:17.93]And talk about my moving predicament.
[30:20.57]Yeah.
[30:21.29]Today is play the game day.
[30:24.65]How fun is moving?
[30:27.31]Isn't it really fun?
[30:29.74]We're kind of settled mostly now, besides our address not existing.
[30:35.55]Yeah, that sounds weird.
[30:37.57]I'm gonna break this shield, watch out.
[30:40.53]Shield breaker.
[30:49.70]More are spawning.
[30:54.23]I'm gonna break your shield, hold on.
[30:55.23]See, the difference is I actually gave you a warning and you could get out of the way.
[31:00.21]Don't get hit by that.
[31:01.23]Look at all this blood and gush.
[31:06.06]I'm gonna turn the music down a little bit.
[31:10.24]Via Windows sounds.
[31:17.94]I can find it.
[31:21.59]I'm fine with that.
[31:28.66]Do you know what that means?
[31:32.18]I'm throwing a bomb.
[31:34.26]Yes.
[31:36.81]Hit one person.
[31:38.01]Hit two.
[31:38.45]How did it hit on my screen and only hit one dude?
[31:41.83]Oh, it hit two.
[31:42.79]It cut the one skeleton into like a half person.
[31:45.83]You sure?
[31:46.87]I am sure.
[31:48.41]Run back to tapes.
[31:50.40]Tapes?
[31:54.26]I'm going first.
[31:56.76]What?
[31:57.16]How is that even possible?
[31:58.46]You got him first.
[32:00.46]I don't know.
[32:08.09]Oh, so... Dude, didn't we have like 30 gold by this point last time?
[32:11.37]I have three.
[32:13.41]Random number generator.
[32:16.44]I don't think that's a tree that can come down.
[32:17.66]And last time I didn't even get to spend any of my gold because you had to go ahead and like die like an idiot.
[32:23.85]Can you come help?
[32:25.63]Why is that door not open?
[32:37.32]No, don't throw a bomb.
[32:40.06]Did you see those guys that spawned and fell and nothing?
[32:42.22]You fucking idiot.
[32:44.60]That wasn't my fault.
[32:45.94]Oh my god, you fucking dumbass.
[32:48.16]Well, go hit Danny Trejo off.
[32:56.08]Are you getting their souls for you killing them?
[32:58.52]Yes, I am.
[32:59.72]Just stay there.
[33:00.86]I'll handle this.
[33:02.78]Go get the ones down there.
[33:03.88]If he comes up here, it's just whatever.
[33:05.78]No, I can't knock him off.
[33:08.28]Okay, I'm almost done.
[33:09.36]I'm almost back to life.
[33:14.14]Dude, you should be thanking me.
[33:15.50]I healed you.
[33:19.42]Well, I still can't come back.
[33:21.07]And you're going to get all the items in here, so that's great.
[33:26.18]That didn't even hit you.
[33:26.90]How?
[33:28.02]I don't know how.
[33:28.88]But look at all this awesome stuff that you can get.
[33:30.52]Magic missiles.
[33:32.28]All this gold.
[33:36.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[33:37.41]I'm trying to... Please.
[33:39.01]Please.
[33:39.61]I'm going to fart if you do it again.
[33:47.92]You're trying so hard.
[33:51.44]Oh, please!
[33:53.02]Yeah, you told me you were gonna fart and you just didn't.
[33:55.40]I did.
[33:55.78]You probably just didn't hear it.
[33:56.88]Oh my god.
[34:02.65]Seriously was hoping you were gonna follow.
[34:05.61]Okay, I'm taking this because the knife is critical chance plus 50 and I already had crits.
[34:09.39]You can come back here and get this like stupid short sword if you want.
[34:11.93]Great.
[34:13.56]I'm happy about that.
[34:14.56]What do I look like?
[34:15.16]I look like a cartoon character from something.
[34:19.18]What character is this?
[34:20.10]Chat, who is this?
[34:24.04]Adventure Time or something?
[34:25.10]I don't know.
[34:25.40]I can't think of who this is.
[34:27.35]Flapjack?
[34:28.97]The guy from Flapjack?
[34:34.03]Can you just come back to life already?
[34:35.45]You're annoying everyone.
[34:36.43]I'm waiting for you to kill.
[34:37.39]Alright, I'm going back to get that.
[34:43.13]You're annoying everyone.
[34:47.01]Yeah, I'm annoying everyone.
[34:48.63]Oh, there's a shop here.
[34:49.91]There's actually a shop this time.
[34:51.50]I have six gold.
[34:53.87]I have 20.
[34:55.44]I guess it's like... Poisoned.
[34:58.00]I don't even want the poison dagger.
[34:59.20]Guilty orcish weapon.
[35:01.92]How much is that?
[35:02.42]20?
[35:02.50]Well, these are awesome.
[35:04.64]I have 20.
[35:06.42]I mean, I could buy this and give it to you if you want one of these.
[35:09.14]100?
[35:09.84]100.
[35:11.30]Yeah, those boots are crazy though.
[35:13.02]Nah, I mean, I have a 10 damage.
[35:17.22]Every 10 seconds your jump explodes.
[35:19.44]Oh my god.
[35:20.60]Whatever, let's go.
[35:21.81]The Abominable Snowman, that probably, that might be it.
[35:23.79]What?
[35:27.63]I asked chat who my guy looked like, and it was... Oh.
[35:31.64]Trying to see what they said.
[35:33.98]Yeah, actually, it does look like a Nicola.
[35:36.02]Yeah, didn't it?
[35:36.52]I just don't know.
[35:37.04]I couldn't put my finger on it.
[35:39.66]Look, I'll die again so we can see it.
[35:45.71]Watch out.
[36:02.44]Most of those hit you!
[36:04.38]You hit me with so many of those.
[36:06.96]You can't, like, aim those at all.
[36:10.04]That's good for a crowd.
[36:13.70]You know, you wanna know what's good for a crowd?
[36:15.08]What?
[36:17.72]Like a concert.
[36:21.01]Yeah.
[36:21.77]Yeah.
[36:23.33]Why are they trying to target me?
[36:25.72]Dude, nice work.
[36:26.34]Thanks, Ms.
[36:26.76]Pauling.
[36:28.92]Can we take this?
[36:32.61]I have ass disease.
[36:39.67]What's that?
[36:44.99]I feel like these do something.
[36:46.83]No.
[36:47.47]Oh.
[36:48.63]That's a stone.
[36:50.01]Oh, God.
[36:50.47]Not again.
[36:51.19]This door's locked, by the way.
[36:53.19]Don't touch anything.
[36:53.95]Don't touch it, because those things probably come to life.
[36:55.81]Just focus on the little dudes.
[36:57.63]I don't think they do.
[36:58.91]Do they not?
[36:59.47]Okay, well then, I'm just picking this up.
[37:04.64]I'm gonna die.
[37:05.30]I'm gonna die.
[37:06.24]I'm gonna die.
[37:06.80]I'm gonna die.
[37:07.38]I'm gonna die.
[37:08.08]I'm gonna die.
[37:08.58]I'm gonna die.
[37:09.30]I'm gonna die.
[37:09.90]I'm going to die, Jerma.
[37:12.89]Only one of us can die at a time.
[37:14.31]His health, his health right there.
[37:15.52]Do you see the health?
[37:19.98]Why is it my responsibility?
[37:21.90]Fine, I'll take it.
[37:23.76]I'm good to go.
[37:26.80]Better not die.
[37:27.38]Don't worry.
[37:30.33]These side doors suck, by the way.
[37:35.33]Don't do that, you're pushing them too far away from me.
[37:43.31]Not really, he hit me right in the face with that.
[37:45.67]What an ass.
[37:48.15]Oh my god, I have to fart again!
[37:49.41]What?
[37:53.31]What?
[37:53.63]What?
[37:53.81]There's no way!
[37:54.63]What are you doing?
[37:55.85]That was awesome!
[38:13.02]That was like a comic!
[38:15.02]That was like a cartoon!
[38:17.00]Am I watching Ren and Stimpy right now, or am I like... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, like, you shouldn't laugh that hard at that.
[38:23.81]Oh my god.
[38:24.53]Okay, let's play.
[38:27.21]Nice work!
[38:27.93]Thanks.
[38:30.27]Thanks.
[38:40.12]You better not die now!
[38:44.11]Oh, man, that was... Get back to life, please.
[38:45.99]I can't play.
[38:48.55]Why?
[38:58.44]Why?
[38:58.68]Okay, who's gonna get the chest?
[39:08.17]Yeah, okay, back to reality over here.
[39:11.37]By which I mean the video game.
[39:13.59]Oh my god, I have to look.
[39:14.43]Someone just, like, gave me money.
[39:15.71]For, like, farting.
[39:17.35]They were probably, like, really impressed with that.
[39:21.99]Never, never would've wanted to read this more.
[39:23.83]It looks like I'm gonna use it as my hit sound.
[39:29.86]Yeah, the message just says, nice fart.
[39:31.98]Thanks.
[39:33.54]That fart was apparently worth $3.33.
[39:38.58]Oh, jumping disease.
[39:39.68]Good luck.
[39:40.28]What was in that chest, by the way?
[39:41.42]I didn't even... I had the game all day.
[39:42.94]Just money in that.
[39:45.20]Okay.
[39:45.32]Alright.
[39:47.34]I'm hoping we're almost at the end so I can overcome jumping disease and be able to... You know?
[39:53.34]I think that is the end.
[39:58.00]Well, we'll find out.
[40:00.44]Give me that.
[40:02.50]Hey!
[40:03.91]You really want the health?
[40:05.19]You have full health!
[40:05.83]I have 14.
[40:10.57]Are you kidding me right now?
[40:14.71]Let's go.
[40:18.41]I'm gonna die again.
[40:20.07]And I could have been totally fine.
[40:21.41]Let's go.
[40:28.30]I have three health.
[40:29.50]We'll be okay.
[40:30.82]You have to kill everything.
[40:31.72]I'm not doing anything now.
[40:32.94]I'm just gonna walk around and hit the sticks.
[40:34.50]We're gonna be okay.
[40:39.31]This better be the end.
[40:39.93]I think this is the end.
[40:40.95]Yeah, it is.
[40:44.24]Yeah, I overcame jumping disease.
[40:51.26]Did I overcome it?
[40:54.18]Uh, I did not.
[40:55.69]Yeah, no, it keeps going.
[40:56.87]How much health do you have?
[40:57.63]Three.
[40:58.29]It really is a potion.
[41:00.19]Yeah, I could use a potion right now.
[41:01.47]It would be great if I could have found one.
[41:03.81]And somebody else didn't take it at full health and throw it into the garbage.
[41:07.05]Intentionally die.
[41:08.15]Do it, do it.
[41:08.63]Die right now.
[41:09.57]No.
[41:09.77]And I'll kill everything.
[41:11.02]No.
[41:11.96]And then I won't overcome jumping disease.
[41:18.06]When you die, you overcome diseases.
[41:20.84]No.
[41:21.62]Yeah, when you respawn, you don't jump anymore.
[41:24.92]Oh, you want the achievement for that too.
[41:26.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:30.68]I actually will unlock somebody if I do one more thing after that.
[41:38.56]I think it's how many rooms, by the way.
[41:40.55]Top left?
[41:41.09]Top right?
[41:41.71]Yeah, possibly.
[41:45.01]I believe that.
[41:45.57]That's definitely what it is.
[41:47.83]I would be surprised if it wasn't.
[41:54.78]Okay.
[41:58.95]Let's see if the hypothesis is correct.
[42:01.59]Oh, I want the bomb.
[42:02.89]Yes, the hypothesis is correct.
[42:07.79]Just make them walk into the pit.
[42:09.47]They're stupid.
[42:11.29]Um, maybe not.
[42:11.77]Maybe not.
[42:12.25]Yeah, they're pretty dumb.
[42:14.46]They don't have that much health anyway, so I'm just... I'm ripping and tearing, dude.
[42:24.14]Anytime you want to help.
[42:26.40]I'm scared.
[42:26.88]I don't want to jump into the hole.
[42:28.90]I'm about to overcome my disease.
[42:32.22]Overcome.
[42:32.94]I did it.
[42:33.24]There's a bunch of people in here.
[42:35.71]Oh, aren't you gonna help you?
[42:37.25]You should come in here, yeah.
[42:38.11]You should probably get in here.
[42:40.69]These are the spikes that only activate if someone touches them.
[42:44.23]No, they're not.
[42:44.77]Never mind.
[42:45.17]These ones are just... Are they?
[42:47.29]No, yeah, these ones are just poppin'.
[42:48.51]I have no heart.
[42:51.55]You're not gonna do that again, are you?
[42:56.92]You're seriously gonna do it again.
[42:59.26]Gotta admit, last time I didn't mean to do it that much.
[43:01.35]Alright.
[43:04.57]I'll... Let me open this shit.
[43:09.47]I hope this kills you.
[43:12.18]Yeah.
[43:13.62]Ooh!
[43:13.88]Ooh!
[43:14.42]Ooh, it has the jaw.
[43:15.26]You get the jaw.
[43:15.82]Ooh.
[43:18.02]Are you sure?
[43:18.78]Unless you don't want it.
[43:20.26]Oh my god, it's gonna be loud.
[43:21.50]Well, can't you...
[43:27.77]I'm kind of just, like, waiting.
[43:29.55]No, let's go, let's go.
[43:31.95]Alright, fine, I'll get it.
[43:33.49]What did I eat?
[43:34.19]I don't know.
[43:36.83]But... Maybe you shouldn't eat it again.
[43:39.36]I don't know.
[43:40.20]I think I had Subway.
[43:41.34]I had a chicken bacon ranch, onions on it.
[43:43.14]Maybe it's onions.
[43:46.92]I don't know if onions make you do... Yeah, I don't... SpongeBob fun.
[43:55.07]I'm so sorry.
[43:55.97]I'm so sorry.
[43:59.71]Are you?
[44:01.57]I am.
[44:05.23]Those don't do anything.
[44:07.85]I'm dead.
[44:11.21]Imagine if I had an extra 40 health.
[44:14.09]What would you have done with it?
[44:15.95]Would you have knocked me into a corner with it?
[44:23.36]Can you s- please, Jerma?
[44:28.14]Come get these items.
[44:32.17]No!
[44:32.45]I don't want them.
[44:38.25]I'll take all this.
[44:38.87]RIP and kill things, man!
[44:40.06]What the heck?
[44:40.70]You're the one who fucking did like 30 points of damage to me!
[44:44.21]Hey, I'm gonna... You want a potion?
[44:46.69]You need help.
[44:48.69]God, I'm gonna fart right now.
[44:51.53]Yeah, right.
[44:52.53]Please.
[44:53.77]I would love for you to be here and take this.
[44:56.09]I would love to be here and take that, too.
[44:58.55]If I don't get it, then nobody does.
[45:04.36]What does that even do?
[45:04.90]I don't even want to tell you.
[45:08.80]Maybe if you were alive, you'd understand.
[45:11.14]Maybe.
[45:14.46]Oh, I would love to buy that.
[45:18.88]I can afford all this.
[45:19.76]Saves you from death.
[45:23.75]Some nice bread.
[45:24.47]I want that axe.
[45:26.45]I want that axe so bad.
[45:28.03]It says it's really slow, but it does 18.
[45:30.41]You've taken it from me.
[45:31.57]That's bad things you've taken from me.
[45:33.39]Add to the list.
[45:35.79]I'm kind of sick of this butcher knife.
[45:37.01]I'm taking... Saves you from death.
[45:39.45]I can still buy the axe.
[45:43.13]I don't know.
[45:43.39]We still have not encountered our first boss, by the way.
[45:45.55]What does the magic jumping beam do?
[45:53.66]Whatever it is.
[45:54.74]Uh, two health whenever you clear a room without being hit.
[45:56.80]Yeah, that's not that good.
[46:02.17]Alright, go kill nine things so I can buy product.
[46:04.95]No.
[46:08.87]Wait, where do I go?
[46:11.74]Is this hole?
[46:12.57]No, that... Was there an extra door in there?
[46:15.85]Up here, this is the only way we can go.
[46:17.03]Yeah, back here.
[46:19.35]Oh, I didn't see that door because the pole was in front of it.
[46:23.06]Well, there's a lot of enemies in here, so good luck.
[46:31.00]At least we get to come back to life if you die.
[46:44.10]Look, I'm part of them.
[46:44.66]I'm part of the crew.
[46:45.58]I don't think I can even dash with this.
[46:47.88]You can?
[46:50.16]Okay, no, there it is.
[46:50.92]It wasn't doing it.
[46:53.52]That was a great throw.
[46:55.14]It's a good thing I purchased that.
[46:58.30]Hey, you're back.
[46:59.10]That's full health.
[47:01.26]That turned out to be a really good purchase.
[47:05.51]Otherwise, we would be dead.
[47:06.97]Oh, this jump attack does a ton of damage.
[47:08.77]I'm just gonna do that.
[47:10.33]And it's, like, not slow either.
[47:23.46]Big guy.
[47:25.14]I'll keep the big guy down here.
[47:27.35]Yeah, thanks.
[47:28.63]You know, I like it better when you're dead.
[47:33.25]What were these sack boys?
[47:41.80]Taken care of.
[47:42.78]Oh, shit.
[47:46.64]Ha ha!
[47:47.38]Ha ha!
[47:52.59]Get away from me.
[47:54.01]Let a real man handle this.
[48:00.91]Are they, like, reviving?
[48:01.89]I don't think so.
[48:05.43]I just think they're... More of them?
[48:08.65]Yeah.
[48:13.50]Oh, stop their heads.
[48:14.28]That's a lot of bombs.
[48:24.70]Do you actually want this axe?
[48:27.38]You don't want it?
[48:28.36]I'll take my knife back again.
[48:30.12]Well, let me throw it on the ground.
[48:31.68]You can't throw it on the ground without swapping it.
[48:34.26]Go ahead and take that.
[48:37.38]Oh, this thing?
[48:39.73]The thing that goes... Hello?
[48:41.09]I'm coming.
[48:57.25]No, that thing sucks.
[49:00.99]Okay, let's go.
[49:04.05]I thought you meant the axe sucks and you walked out with it.
[49:07.71]Oh, the magic bean.
[49:13.21]You're just walking by money.
[49:14.69]You are just walking by cash.
[49:16.81]I just picked up like four gold.
[49:19.19]So you do it, fucking lackey.
[49:20.81]Come down here and help me.
[49:30.75]I know why you were saying that it doesn't do the thing.
[49:33.30]The dash.
[49:33.72]Because you have to charge it longer?
[49:36.10]Yep.
[49:37.58]It's like a full second longer.
[49:39.20]And stomp their heads.
[49:40.11]That's why they were coming back.
[49:40.97]Just step on their heads and they die.
[49:45.73]Bunch of doors just opened.
[49:47.45]I think that's the end of the level.
[49:50.18]Welp.
[49:52.69]Did we come from here?
[49:53.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:55.40]A bunch of doors, two doors, and we came from... I heard like... Yeah, because it's the end of the level door.
[50:01.50]Oh, like a boss.
[50:02.46]Achievement unlocked.
[50:03.28]Like a boss.
[50:04.46]What do you get for it?
[50:08.58]Ass potion.
[50:09.12]That's all you.
[50:09.62]Okay.
[50:19.76]Leave all this.
[50:20.38]There's a ton of food over here.
[50:21.40]Leave that.
[50:24.49]Jeez.
[50:28.11]That's, like, plus 15 or 20 health.
[50:29.25]And there's another healing potion.
[50:35.09]What is dropping this stuff?
[50:37.61]It's just giving it.
[50:39.47]Is it, though?
[50:39.93]I feel like it's not.
[50:42.37]Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[50:43.93]What, what, what, what, what?
[50:47.60]You could actually use that one.
[50:53.74]Oh, wow.
[50:55.40]I gave it 10 gold for this.
[50:57.72]You pick it all up.
[50:58.56]Oh my god.
[50:59.42]Why?
[51:01.30]When you put on that mask, you no longer get money.
[51:04.06]Yeah.
[51:05.48]I thought it... It disappears after a time.
[51:07.95]It doesn't even matter.
[51:10.61]I've got approximately 40 gold out of that, I think.
[51:13.31]That's cool.
[51:15.13]That's too bad that you had the jaw and full health.
[51:19.27]I wish you would have told me that you had this jaw before.
[51:21.27]Oh, I forgot you had it.
[51:27.33]Of course I haven't.
[51:28.01]Have you not seen how cool I look?
[51:33.88]Oh, these poison spikes that I can't see behind the pillar.
[51:46.53]These guys just ski across.
[51:47.95]That's dumb.
[51:50.65]You're currently poisoned.
[51:52.11]Isn't there booze back there?
[51:54.37]There is.
[51:54.59]That I threw in the ground.
[51:56.17]Would you rather be poisoned than be drunk?
[51:57.66]Poisoning really lasts five rooms.
[52:01.90]I'm going back for the booze.
[52:06.24]Damn it.
[52:15.31]Being drunk sucks.
[52:17.79]Dude, all I know how to talk about is drinks.
[52:22.03]What beer do you like?
[52:23.47]I like that beer.
[52:24.03]Get in here.
[52:24.69]I'm coming.
[52:25.11]God.
[52:28.05]I almost rolled right back into the fucking spikes.
[52:30.78]That would have been pretty funny.
[52:36.22]I'm gonna be throwing a bomb.
[52:38.76]At no one.
[52:39.62]Yep.
[52:41.00]Where am I?
[52:41.54]Oh my god, I'm drunk, dude.
[52:48.20]I'm really good with these bombs.
[52:51.33]It's alright.
[52:51.93]Take it.
[52:52.23]What's this guy?
[52:52.61]Why is this guy... I haven't hit anyone.
[52:56.00]I'm gonna blame it on being drunk.
[53:02.40]Shit.
[53:04.18]Shit!
[53:07.53]Oh my god.
[53:10.83]Really?
[53:11.13]Ahhh.
[53:30.09]I'm drunk as hell, but I can lockpick.
[53:32.05]Ow!
[53:33.21]I got it.
[53:34.85]It was because I was drunk.
[53:37.09]Yeah.
[53:39.55]Oh my god.
[53:41.89]Dude, come on.
[53:44.15]This guy's so cocky.
[53:54.36]I really thought you had it too.
[53:56.14]I did too.
[53:58.98]This is new.
[53:59.98]This is new.
[54:01.02]This is most definitely new.
[54:04.00]Insert 30 coins.
[54:06.44]Insert 30 coins.
[54:11.22]That was not worth it at all.
[54:13.62]Why did I do that?
[54:16.00]It shows in there that it's all potions too.
[54:17.92]All the potions kind of blow.
[54:19.90]They're not worth 30 coins.
[54:23.06]Can we smash this thing then?
[54:26.15]Hey, get your money back.
[54:31.25]I would at least take that it's 50 health.
[54:33.15]I already have one.
[54:34.39]That's the worst part.
[54:36.89]Then I'll take it.
[54:37.71]Okay.
[54:40.61]Let's go.
[54:43.36]New enemy.
[54:43.92]Oh my god, it's Bomb Lover.
[54:44.86]It's five mana.
[54:45.46]I'm scared to go over there.
[54:51.50]Seems like you got that under control.
[54:57.13]This is a new... A song of ice and bombs.
[55:01.77]Get it?
[55:02.43]This is really messy.
[55:05.23]That does so much damage.
[55:08.01]When they die, he kind of just flopped a bunch of them.
[55:14.19]Did you just get shrunken because you drank that?
[55:15.81]Yep.
[55:19.53]Ay carumba.
[55:20.27]You know what I mean?
[55:20.78]It's really not even that bad.
[55:25.33]You know what I mean?
[55:25.93]I have a smaller hitbox.
[55:26.81]Depends.
[55:31.09]Two things open.
[55:31.89]We have this and then that.
[55:33.33]Oh, the doom.
[55:34.21]Do you remember how hard this was last time?
[55:35.85]Do we really want to do this?
[55:38.68]Or maybe try and heal a bit first.
[55:42.80]Get that health.
[55:47.00]I don't know.
[55:47.90]Let's do it.
[55:49.34]Let's do it.
[55:51.08]Sometimes you just gotta, sometimes it's gotta be.
[55:53.68]This run has kind of sucked.
[55:55.58]We're on stream right now.
[55:56.72]We can't just be like, you know, it's too hard.
[55:58.66]Well, no, I mean, like, let's go do, like, a room and come back.
[56:01.16]Like, see if we can get some... I mean, I can still leave.
[56:07.40]Look at all this stuff.
[56:08.02]Oh, my God.
[56:10.00]Oh, we can't even pick up the turtle armor.
[56:13.17]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[56:14.63]I just told you.
[56:15.49]That's why I froze freaking out.
[56:17.19]Didn't want to do it.
[56:18.13]22 damage freezes people.
[56:21.29]Didn't want to do this.
[56:22.46]Look at this.
[56:23.16]They always give good items, but I mean, like, this area is hard.
[56:28.32]Understand?
[56:28.76]You know where I'm coming from?
[56:30.30]No.
[56:32.78]This one doesn't seem so bad so far, though.
[56:35.57]It got worse, I think, over time.
[56:37.81]Yeah, yeah.
[56:42.59]We've got the lightning thing.
[56:43.53]It's too bad we can't wear armor.
[56:47.32]Yeah, I know.
[56:48.76]Too bad we're both barbarians, because it's the only thing you can unlock this early.
[56:54.42]I'd like some class diversity here.
[56:55.90]If one of us does enough achievements, we'll be able to do it.
[57:04.21]Well, you know how I play video games.
[57:07.67]Yes, I'm going to wake up tomorrow, and you're going to have beaten this game 50 times.
[57:10.89]And I don't want to play anymore.
[57:12.35]Yeah.
[57:15.00]Oh, we got some of the head crush people.
[57:16.32]Remember to crush the heads.
[57:19.54]Yes, yes, yes.
[57:25.28]Bomb lobbers.
[57:25.80]Ow.
[57:30.93]Yeah, watch out for the bombies.
[57:36.57]I don't like the red on this room.
[57:39.41]Yeah, it hurts my face.
[57:46.65]That wasn't that bad at all.
[57:47.33]Yeah, that was pretty, uh... We got some good shit, too.
[57:50.57]I just, like, have no health.
[57:51.83]Blocks all hits?
[57:54.03]Drops pizza slice when you hit?
[57:55.74]That thing seems amazing, but we can't use it.
[58:01.10]Oh, durability four.
[58:02.08]So I guess you can only get hit four times.
[58:05.08]Oh, okay.
[58:05.80]I see.
[58:06.05]Yeah, this is too bad we can't use those.
[58:08.79]How barbarians don't get to use armor.
[58:10.37]For those uninformed morons that are watching...
[58:17.91]I really need health.
[58:19.55]Or for you to be able to kill 10 people.
[58:21.01]For a second I thought you said, I really need help, and I was like, yeah, you do.
[58:36.34]I actually really don't like being this small.
[58:38.28]It's kind of hard to see what I'm doing.
[58:39.42]Now I look like a homeless ghost.
[58:45.33]I look like the guy from Plants vs. Zombies if he was a ghost.
[58:49.33]Yep.
[58:50.41]You do.
[58:55.64]The lightning thing is so good.
[59:02.14]I'm just gonna keep these guys away.
[59:04.50]Keep them on the other side.
[59:05.93]Sometimes it seriously feels like it's just better to be a ghost.
[59:08.43]Well, you don't have to worry about dying.
[59:16.03]Are those things going over there and hitting stuff?
[59:17.63]Yeah.
[59:21.07]Though some of them are hitting me.
[59:28.42]Shit.
[59:28.94]Hurt.
[59:32.44]Hey.
[59:32.64]Sorry.
[59:33.44]Hey.
[59:34.58]You seemed like you were smaller and you weren't gonna get hit by it.
[59:36.76]Can you, like, kill them already?
[59:38.64]I'm so small!
[59:39.46]Do you see how little I am?
[59:41.50]Takes me longer.
[59:42.56]combo them in the air oh my if you die here I'm never gonna forgive you ever I just got double shrinking I guess when you're like already that diseased how many do you need me to kill five
[60:14.38]Five.
[60:16.76]Chill out.
[60:18.32]Two.
[60:18.60]I need to kill two.
[60:19.48]Come on, kill two.
[60:20.34]To get on the ground.
[60:24.63]One more.
[60:25.93]Here you come.
[60:26.45]You ready?
[60:26.95]You're coming back right now.
[60:27.91]They just spawned a whole bunch of skeletons.
[60:29.69]Well, here you come.
[60:44.75]This run's been going pretty long, hasn't it?
[60:46.70]Yeah, we haven't gotten this run before.
[60:49.06]We haven't seen a boss or anything yet either.
[60:51.22]No.
[60:52.08]I mean, are you sure there's bosses?
[60:54.74]One of the challenges is beat your first boss.
[60:56.74]Oh.
[60:58.42]So I'm assuming, yeah.
[60:59.30]I think we can break his shield.
[61:17.06]I'm taking way too much damage on these like shitty boys You know, I mean when I say shitty boys it's these guys Can I get like one gold so I have 70 no apparently not
[61:48.79]Boss.
[61:49.59]Yep.
[61:51.05]Don't- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[61:52.09]Easy, easy.
[61:53.99]I think that's an NPC.
[61:55.47]He's just- he's a friend.
[61:56.97]That's not an NPC.
[61:57.97]If that's an NPC, I will give you five bucks.
[62:01.77]Because that's the scariest looking NPC I've ever seen.
[62:05.00]He's sleeping too.
[62:05.68]Well, we can't fall down there anymore.
[62:07.56]And I got an achievement.
[62:08.20]Don't, uh... Hold on.
[62:09.52]Oh, God, for the love of- Okay, we can't fall down.
[62:12.80]So just stay back and see what he does.
[62:15.26]Because we've never been here before.
[62:17.11]Okay, he shoots Pac-Man.
[62:18.85]They take one hit.
[62:24.33]He throws up dead bodies.
[62:25.73]Oh, they come to life.
[62:28.71]Thankfully, they don't take very much.
[62:29.81]Yeah, thankfully we can't fall on the ground here with his air blowing back.
[62:33.33]That seems like the whole reason why this guy would be difficult.
[62:35.67]I won't say that.
[62:39.53]He seems to be shooting at a lot of things.
[62:42.69]I just don't know if we're supposed to be hitting him or just dealing with these guys.
[62:45.91]I don't know.
[62:48.35]Because I think the hits I saw on him were zero.
[62:50.09]Oh, my God.
[62:50.89]He just... Oh, my God.
[62:52.46]That doesn't hit you if you're on these spikes back here.
[62:54.46]I can't move.
[62:57.02]It doesn't go all the way back here.
[62:58.12]I'm just going to do this.
[63:03.08]I'm so small.
[63:03.48]These things are hard to hit.
[63:05.26]I'm going to die, man.
[63:06.52]I'm so tiny.
[63:07.32]I can't even tell where my axe is going half the time.
[63:09.76]We have to get the achievement.
[63:13.19]Well, good luck to you.
[63:17.88]Hopefully I'm hitting him with, like, straight bow.
[63:19.34]Actually, those things take care of those little things pretty easily.
[63:22.02]They just don't stop.
[63:29.54]I'm dead.
[63:30.64]See ya.
[63:32.10]Actually, you know what?
[63:32.92]You might... If you... Those ten of these things... I'm gonna assume that these things can die.
[63:39.52]Yep.
[63:40.72]Just try to stay alive.
[63:41.40]We can just revive each other forever?
[63:43.22]Yeah.
[63:44.90]That is... You know, get, like, overwhelmed here.
[63:50.40]I'll keep these things up here.
[63:51.86]These stupid blobs.
[63:53.16]Ooh, he's killing them.
[63:53.94]Okay, he's killing them too.
[63:55.50]One more and I'm back.
[63:56.08]I'm back.
[64:00.50]Why did it spawn me down here?
[64:01.46]I don't know.
[64:03.06]It spawned me right in his arm.
[64:05.74]Doesn't it seem like this would be impossible if we had to stand close to him?
[64:10.36]Yes.
[64:12.02]So it's a good thing I had the thingy.
[64:14.68]Get health up there.
[64:20.66]Something I'm noticing, we haven't, like, done any damage to him.
[64:23.02]Yeah, I don't know how.
[64:23.70]We're just doing this forever.
[64:31.74]Like, half of them are... I think you have to hit his arms first.
[64:34.76]No, those are blocked now as well.
[64:36.20]Oh, I'm doing damage to his arm.
[64:38.62]Yeah, like, I was doing that.
[64:40.12]I just don't know why I wasn't, why I wasn't.
[64:45.56]I don't know.
[64:47.66]Oh, his eye pops out.
[64:49.74]The eye is on the bottom one.
[64:51.06]Oh, there it goes.
[64:53.74]Back out.
[64:55.35]Damn, man.
[64:55.93]This is hard.
[64:56.89]He's going to start doing his spikes on the ground soon again or something.
[65:02.23]Yep.
[65:06.15]Without the spell, I don't know how you'd even beat this.
[65:10.37]This seems almost uncompletable unless you have the thing that you did.
[65:13.87]Or like a way better build than we have with this run.
[65:16.45]Because we didn't really do very well this run, I don't think.
[65:21.53]I just beat up his eye a little bit.
[65:23.46]I'm coming back to the home base.
[65:29.38]I'm gonna die soon.
[65:30.10]No, it should be okay.
[65:46.80]Dead.
[65:48.28]This is rough.
[65:51.98]I wish he would spawn things so he could get free kills here.
[66:00.32]Come on.
[66:01.10]Spawn some people.
[66:01.78]Don't worry, I'll do one damage to him at a time.
[66:04.16]There we go.
[66:09.04]Just take your time with them.
[66:14.95]He like stomped half of them.
[66:19.28]Does this game have online co-op or only local?
[66:23.78]While Jerma doesn't live with me.
[66:28.80]So we're playing online.
[66:30.38]How many more do you need?
[66:32.06]Three.
[66:38.74]Most of the damage we've done I feel like is that spell.
[66:42.27]Maybe.
[66:48.79]See where it spawns you?
[66:50.13]Yeah.
[66:56.59]Shit.
[67:00.85]I'm gonna work on his eyes.
[67:08.15]Can you handle the little shit units?
[67:10.49]Because I could stomp his face.
[67:12.05]I guess.
[67:13.23]Or hit him in the...
[67:16.60]I have a really hard time hitting the little pink guys.
[67:21.93]I already took, like, 50 points of damage.
[67:24.93]Well, as long as one of us stays alive.
[67:31.03]With preferably more than, like, half health, we should be okay.
[67:35.60]Unless we get overwhelmed like this.
[67:38.34]Yeah, he just, like, is tired of us.
[67:41.36]We hit his enrage timer.
[67:43.48]Probably.
[67:43.88]Probably.
[67:45.51]Because there's a lot of dudes right now.
[67:47.19]There really is a lot.
[67:52.39]At least he's dropping a lot of food.
[68:03.08]Oh my god, I'm sorry.
[68:03.80]That's okay.
[68:07.22]What's the indicator that he's gonna do the spikes?
[68:10.01]I think it's just like, I don't, he lifts his feet, I don't know.
[68:13.31]I haven't actually seen him.
[68:15.21]One of the bottoms.
[68:15.69]Yeah, I've been focusing the bottom one, so if you can get in there, try and do that one.
[68:25.86]Oh, here it comes.
[68:27.58]He lifts his feet to do that as a stomp.
[68:33.04]I think we can do this.
[68:34.74]Yeah, we'll be okay.
[68:36.75]It's going to take us a half hour, but we'll do it.
[68:39.15]Well, his bottom leg's almost dead.
[68:48.52]I'm going in.
[68:52.30]I'm taking all the damage.
[68:54.54]Bottom one is destroyed.
[68:56.08]Nice.
[68:57.66]It's full of things.
[69:00.24]He breasted.
[69:00.72]Yeah, he can.
[69:01.90]No, that was just a regular stomp.
[69:03.68]Oh.
[69:08.48]We should only go in one at a time there.
[69:09.72]Yeah, so one of us.
[69:10.86]Well, let me go in because I'm closer to dying.
[69:13.02]It's the risk.
[69:14.75]He hasn't spawned anyone.
[69:17.11]Maybe that was his spawning leg.
[69:20.55]Yeah.
[69:21.67]Nope.
[69:22.07]Nope.
[69:23.42]I thought that maybe was what we were dealing with.
[69:32.05]His top leg does the spikes.
[69:34.35]What does his bottom leg do?
[69:36.41]I don't know, because it's apparently still doing spikes.
[69:39.15]This is kind of like the Andross fight from Star Fox.
[69:41.33]Doesn't his right hand and left hand do different things?
[69:46.45]Too much damage I just took right there.
[69:47.83]I can't wait to see how many enemies we have killed.
[69:54.48]His top leg is down.
[69:55.46]That's just his face.
[69:58.81]You have to jump to hit this?
[70:00.33]Yeah.
[70:00.92]Oh, do you?
[70:01.88]Yeah.
[70:08.62]Alright, I gotta go face.
[70:10.28]Go face, haha.
[70:11.10]Come on, we gotta go face, there's more.
[70:15.04]You just hit him, because I will end up hurting you.
[70:28.16]Which health does he have?
[70:29.62]Uh, like half, I think?
[70:30.32]He can still use his leg.
[70:31.40]He can still use his leg.
[70:32.34]That's kinda silly.
[70:34.12]That is kinda silly.
[70:34.76]I'm just gonna do this.
[70:36.86]What's the worst that could happen?
[70:50.13]He's probably gonna spit, guys.
[70:51.11]Yeah.
[70:56.76]So this is on normal.
[70:58.37]I can't imagine how outrageously annoying this would be on hard or extreme.
[71:02.14]I'm down to 15 health.
[71:03.24]Don't die.
[71:04.62]You just played super safe.
[71:06.92]I feel like he's going to do spikes again soon.
[71:26.78]How's that doing zero?
[71:28.06]You have to go up, and those just don't go up.
[71:33.26]Oh, spikes!
[71:33.70]Are you dead?
[71:37.72]I'm seven.
[71:38.20]Actually, it might not be a terrible thing if you just die, just in case we both get caught in something stupid.
[71:50.09]Oh, we might be able to kill him.
[71:54.31]I'm brave in the storm!
[72:02.30]yeah we did it wow hold on hold on a second don't just steal things don't just steal things I'm taking everything Criken's doll
[72:20.86]What?
[72:21.58]What?
[72:21.78]I was... I... Gerba.
[72:24.24]Of all the things here that I actually wanted, that increased crit damage, and all my shit had increased crit chance, and now I'm sad.
[72:31.04]You just... You took the big scary ass.
[72:33.22]I can give that to you.
[72:34.26]No, you can't.
[72:36.66]Fine, I'm not, because you took the freaking crab people.
[72:38.80]I wanted to be a fucking crab person.
[72:40.92]Well, we won.
[72:41.52]It doesn't matter.
[72:42.18]We're going to go in this thing, and it's going to reset anyways.
[72:44.18]No, it's not.
[72:45.38]Yeah, watch, right?
[72:47.18]Check it.
[72:47.70]Check it out.
[72:49.72]Here we go.
[72:50.12]Watch.
[72:51.99]Told you.
[72:52.29]Well done.
[72:55.97]Thanks, Ms.
[72:56.63]Pauling.
[72:57.05]The Ms.
[72:59.03]Pauling timing from everyone is really top notch.
[73:02.41]See, it started over.
[73:07.33]What does that axe even do, by the way?
[73:09.73]Nothing.
[73:10.93]I mean, nothing.
[73:12.11]You made an extremely loud noise when you picked it up.
[73:14.86]You don't get to know.
[73:16.84]Fine, you don't get to know what crabs do.
[73:21.43]That's that's really really awesome and really cool.
[73:23.43]I wish I had that item So don't worry the crabs are like dumb in comparison to that.
[73:26.87]You just did you just did a Like thundercats into the sky and you telling me that you'd rather be the crab man.
[73:33.84]Yeah.
[73:34.00]Oh You wanna know something about the crab man, that's really interesting.
[73:38.02]I can't turn to the left No, I Cannot face left What the hell is that?
[73:50.34]Yeah, I can't turn left.
[73:52.24]I think I'm holding my hands up and I can block.
[73:54.88]I have no idea, but I can't look left.
[73:56.22]I'm going to die.
[73:58.16]Would it be bad to die here?
[73:59.15]Do you think you can do this?
[74:01.97]Probably bad, considering I don't know what these things do and I can't look left.
[74:05.07]Did you even read the item?
[74:09.09]Because I think it did say something about being right-handed.
[74:13.07]I was too busy trying to steal it.
[74:17.56]No.
[74:17.70]No.
[74:19.76]Whoa.
[74:20.84]Scary guys.
[74:22.64]Uh, that are summoning also scary guys.
[74:31.72]I'm 6 health.
[74:32.12]He's got a lot of health.
[74:38.85]Crabs actually attack.
[74:40.79]Yeah, you know, it must be really cool to be a fucking crab dude.
[74:43.91]Actually, I don't like being able to only face right with it.
[74:52.40]Dead.
[74:53.92]You're dead?
[74:54.64]I'm dead.
[75:01.18]This, um, that eyeball at the top that we have no idea what it does is nearly dead.
[75:04.93]I'm gonna try and keep the giant, giant stunned.
[75:12.25]And by try I mean I hope you can kill seven things.
[75:16.55]Me too.
[75:21.60]There's like moonwalk up here.
[75:29.30]I feel like I pushed him at you.
[75:31.62]I think you did.
[75:34.86]I wish I could turn.
[75:39.14]The crabs are gonna slowly kill everything.
[75:43.35]How many more?
[75:45.09]One.
[75:47.41]Don't jump.
[75:47.97]Don't jump.
[75:48.51]Don't jump.
[75:49.27]He's gonna jump.
[75:49.81]He's gonna jump.
[75:50.21]It's gonna be over.
[75:53.55]He's like, I killed him.
[75:55.33]Thank God.
[75:56.77]That would have been so bad.
[75:59.49]Come on, please do your Highlander move.
[76:02.87]This is not over.
[76:04.39]This game just got extremely difficult.
[76:08.30]It's right after we killed the extremely difficult boss that gave us really good weapons that we didn't decide who got to pick up, and I ate that even though I was full health.
[76:23.41]Random disease time.
[76:25.04]My max HP went down, by the way.
[76:27.18]I don't know what item I have.
[76:28.74]Maybe you should have read the crab thing.
[76:31.44]No, it's the curse thing that I just took.
[76:34.40]My spell damage.
[76:35.96]I have a ton of spell damage, which is why this is actually worth doing now.
[76:39.55]But I have 45 health.
[76:40.95]Let's go.
[76:42.07]Cool.
[76:46.29]I'm going to die if I try and jump.
[76:49.27]Take him in.
[76:50.49]That was just the chicken from Jerma Rumble, by the way.
[76:53.03]I'm dead.
[76:55.57]I was too busy focusing on that.
[77:00.77]Ooh!
[77:01.07]Ooh!
[77:02.38]Even my ghost can't turn left.
[77:05.24]No, that's continuity.
[77:07.98]Why did I- Did you hit me?!
[77:12.06]Did you hit me?!
[77:15.12]Fuck you!
[77:16.66]You definitely did.
[77:19.66]No, you jumped.
[77:21.06]Yeah, that's why I got hit and like flipped in the air.
[77:25.42]That was a good run.
[77:26.22]What a loser.
[77:35.57]I'm sorry.
[77:37.19]I can be another class, look.
[77:38.87]What class is that?
[77:41.15]Assassin.
[77:43.65]I wanna be an assassin.
[77:48.45]Okay, you have 60 vitality, 120% run speed, double jump, and you can assassinate a lying enemy.
[77:58.10]Also, when you do evade, it's a smoke screen.
[78:01.00]Oh, wow.
[78:02.14]Really?
[78:04.86]Wow.
[78:05.40]That's pretty cool.
[78:06.76]That's really cool.
[78:07.94]Let's, like, start from the beginning.
[78:10.44]You got too close to me.
[78:14.94]I don't want to be... I'm going to be... I'm going to change my face.
[78:19.70]I'm gonna fart in your cereal.
[78:22.61]I just want to be like anyone different.
[78:27.75]On the highway to hell.
[78:29.69]What is that?
[78:40.02]I can be Loki.
[78:46.58]That's really cool.
[78:48.13]Can I stay invisible forever?
[78:49.13]I think so.
[78:50.89]Oh, no.
[78:51.87]I'm mad.
[78:53.19]Let's go.
[79:02.69]For a second, I thought the tree was needing a lockpick.
[79:06.75]This is a hard one.
[79:14.44]Something dropped.
[79:14.96]Did you pick it up?
[79:15.60]Marquee water.
[79:17.98]funny because this really is like a star character move really fast and do fast attack speeds I just want to be anyone different yeah barbarians kind of like yeah we've done it like a couple times and I want to see what warlock and does it's like an eight second cooldown but you can insta kill anybody on the ground that's cool I have a long sword that I will get rid of the first time a weapon drops
[79:46.74]You do.
[79:47.30]Also, I can't equip armor.
[79:50.56]Well, then pick the regular, the ranger.
[79:52.12]He's like the all-around adventurer.
[79:54.51]You don't like the barbarian so much.
[79:55.73]I actually don't.
[79:56.57]I probably should have.
[80:01.23]Whatever.
[80:01.57]I'm going to stop complaining.
[80:02.41]I'm going to be happy about life.
[80:04.55]That's really awesome.
[80:05.75]That insta-kill is so good.
[80:06.97]Doing that to ogres is going to be incredible.
[80:09.21]What is it that you do?
[80:10.95]Every, like, eight seconds, I can instantly kill anybody lying on the ground.
[80:16.96]Do it.
[80:18.52]Well, just kill this guy.
[80:19.80]I don't need to, like... What am I going to show you, like a diagram?
[80:23.72]You'll see it.
[80:24.18]I don't want to be... So, I've come to the realization that me doing the evasion is not me disappearing, it's every enemy wanting to hurt you.
[80:40.13]Yeah.
[80:41.68]So, yeah, there's that.
[80:43.06]When I hit right trigger, everybody wants to hurt you.
[80:47.23]Knock this guy on the ground.
[80:51.37]Or maybe he'll just fall.
[80:54.36]Knocked you on the ground.
[80:55.10]Is that the same thing?
[80:57.16]Nope.
[80:58.30]I'm, like, dying already.
[81:05.36]Watch this.
[81:05.62]Ready?
[81:05.76]Watch, watch, watch.
[81:06.94]Oh, well, here.
[81:08.80]Blew his head up.
[81:09.52]You're going to be really happy because in here is going to be something cool that you want.
[81:18.67]Random blessing.
[81:21.58]Don't know what that does.
[81:22.32]Yeah, drink that.
[81:30.54]Have we figured out what this actually is?
[81:34.51]No.
[81:34.71]The ass disease thing.
[81:35.97]It's for six rooms.
[81:36.73]What the hell does it even mean?
[81:38.99]It just makes your face look dumb.
[81:41.83]Oh, that was a hard room.
[81:42.37]That was a really hard room.
[81:43.46]Yeah.
[81:45.60]I hope this divine shield doesn't- it does wear off, doesn't it?
[81:48.88]No, I think it's four durability.
[81:52.28]According to the top right of the screen?
[81:54.16]No, yeah, it's four- it's three rooms.
[81:55.92]Okay, look, look, look.
[81:58.83]Fuck.
[82:00.51]Those weak bones.
[82:01.15]Thought you were gonna steal that from me.
[82:05.15]Does my roll hit you?
[82:08.71]No.
[82:09.23]Something made you bleed.
[82:10.03]I think it was you cutting me with your sword.
[82:14.48]Yeah, all I had to do was roll.
[82:26.53]Go assassinate this fucking explosive barrel.
[82:31.65]No.
[82:33.28]Seems a little too dangerous.
[82:35.14]Assassinate that guy.
[82:41.78]Another big chest.
[82:42.56]That's cool.
[82:44.63]You're such an amateur.
[82:46.29]Watch this.
[82:47.87]Insta-kill.
[82:48.27]Yeah, you open it.
[82:52.49]Well, I get all this gold.
[82:58.44]What's this meat cleaver?
[83:02.51]It's really just a meat cleaver.
[83:04.75]Yeah, do you want it because you're like stealth guy?
[83:07.21]No.
[83:07.65]I mean, what does it do?
[83:09.17]That's short.
[83:09.71]No, this like short dagger is made for this character.
[83:13.37]What are these sandals?
[83:16.86]I don't know.
[83:19.36]Oh!
[83:20.82]Do I try it?
[83:22.16]Leather boots?
[83:22.98]It says you levitate over chasms.
[83:24.56]Do I do it?
[83:26.52]I don't know.
[83:29.53]Do you have to activate that?
[83:30.55]Nope.
[83:31.67]Oh, wow.
[83:32.45]Best item in the game.
[83:33.51]That's awesome.
[83:36.00]What happens if I pick up your boots?
[83:37.40]I don't know.
[83:37.84]You die.
[83:39.68]Funny that that's true.
[83:41.02]You just insta-die.
[83:43.02]These boots don't belong to you.
[84:03.92]That move is so good.
[84:06.78]I drank that by accident.
[84:07.56]I thought I was on my magic.
[84:11.33]Intakil.
[84:12.81]Intakil.
[84:14.61]What's in there?
[84:16.03]Bombs.
[84:20.19]That worked.
[84:21.19]Oh yeah, you get all the gold because I did it.
[84:25.22]Who picked up a majority of that?
[84:26.94]Was it me or was it you?
[84:28.58]I believe it was you.
[84:29.76]I think it was me.
[84:32.42]You even got the fucking diamond.
[84:38.37]You don't have to worry about that, so you do it.
[84:42.28]Wait, what happens if I, like... Oh, then they throw knives at me.
[84:50.10]I'm glad you're having a lot of fun, but could you please kill enemies?
[84:52.28]I'm not having any fun.
[85:00.52]What?
[85:01.00]Why didn't I do the dash?
[85:02.96]That scares me every time you do that.
[85:05.88]I was like, you idiot.
[85:06.71]I was about to say, you idiot.
[85:08.97]But I was the idiot for not knowing.
[85:11.53]Yeah, you are kind of an idiot.
[85:15.55]Oh, I know what it does.
[85:16.37]The ass... What?
[85:18.80]It farts when you get hit.
[85:19.84]That explains everything.
[85:22.30]Oh, it farts.
[85:26.80]Oh, really?
[85:30.77]It farts?
[85:31.11]Really.
[85:32.43]Really.
[85:43.34]Assassinate.
[85:45.58]Ow, could you guys stop throwing knives at me?
[85:47.18]Yeah, you assassinate him.
[85:50.06]Have fun.
[85:52.70]We actually like to find a shop.
[85:54.02]Yeah, I know.
[85:57.06]Oh, there it is.
[86:09.85]You know, you probably would also have the...
[86:13.27]rogue if you had done the jumping thing yeah I know double jump yes yes I know you see what I get oh that extra coin is pretty cool I want to be a crab warrior oh you idiot you idiot
[86:38.20]And now you've got a crab horn sticking out of your asshole.
[86:43.08]What even is that?
[86:45.53]I'm gonna get this.
[86:49.63]I wanted to be crab guy!
[86:50.87]My guy looks like such a shitty Halloween costume.
[86:56.27]Well, good luck.
[86:57.07]Because you're probably just gonna die over and over again because you can't turn.
[87:04.35]I can roll.
[87:04.85]What do I need to turn for?
[87:10.23]You tell me.
[87:11.53]See, we beat the level.
[87:13.23]I feel like we're concentrating too much and we're neglecting chat.
[87:25.54]I just wanted to play the game.
[87:27.06]This game's fun.
[87:28.54]I'm sorry if chat feels neglected, but... By the way, every time I pick up one of these, I get two gold.
[87:34.79]Yeah.
[87:35.33]I get double money.
[87:36.85]I should let you pick up all the gold.
[87:39.29]No.
[87:40.75]Well, I only have 8 gold anyway.
[87:41.95]It's going to take me a while before I get any reasonable amount of gold.
[87:45.81]I'm scared to go over there because of that chasm.
[87:47.73]It's all you.
[87:49.83]Well, if I go over there, I can only attack right.
[87:53.18]Oh, yeah.
[87:54.22]Good item.
[87:54.50]So I have to stay over here.
[88:07.66]Ow, I just took like 4 billion points of damage.
[88:10.74]You really did.
[88:13.84]It's freaking me out, man.
[88:14.83]I keep thinking I can do that too.
[88:17.83]I just almost walked into the chasm thinking I could do that too.
[88:22.39]That's not a good thought.
[88:26.67]Tomorrow I want to stream and actually talk a bit.
[88:31.08]Talk about moving and stuff.
[88:32.16]Today was just me and Jerome were having fun playing this so I figured why not stream.
[88:37.31]I don't know, that's probably... What is the other thing?
[88:40.03]Scroll of Black Magic?
[88:43.89]Critical hit... Oh, that's so good.
[88:46.99]Wait, doesn't the crab make me crit more or something?
[88:49.83]It does.
[88:50.15]We should pick that up.
[88:51.59]Critical hit damage plus 50%.
[88:54.52]Oh, the Fierce Mask.
[88:55.94]Yeah.
[88:58.28]Oh, so I'm just like a crit machine.
[89:01.42]Uh, yes you are.
[89:02.08]Oh!
[89:02.42]Oh!
[89:06.83]Really?
[89:07.95]Really?
[89:08.47]That reaction was pretty funny.
[89:10.39]I thought I was falling, so I walked forward into the spikes.
[89:13.67]What do I do?
[89:14.71]How do I get by this?
[89:15.99]You have to, like, walk, learn the pattern, and then jump over the spikes.
[89:21.26]You've run faster.
[89:23.20]I know, but I just, I'm scared.
[89:24.48]Hey, dude, just do what I'm doing.
[89:31.17]I wish I could do what you're doing.
[89:37.35]I wish I could do what you're doing right now.
[89:40.67]Oh, turning to my left.
[89:43.77]Uh, God.
[89:45.31]I was about to tell you to be careful.
[89:48.27]Something's gonna happen, I'm gonna fall.
[89:53.61]Every time.
[89:54.08]Oh, this one's hard.
[89:57.68]I think we're gonna see another shop.
[90:05.92]What the fuck is this?
[90:09.03]Creates a magical decoy.
[90:14.89]What?
[90:15.39]Is that like in your spell slot or what?
[90:17.43]Oh, yeah, it is.
[90:18.11]So it's... Yeah, he just makes like a... Ah, that's cool.
[90:22.04]That costs mana?
[90:23.58]Yeah, it costs a full mana bar.
[90:28.50]That's cool.
[90:28.74]That's probably pretty useful.
[90:35.29]Oh no.
[90:37.07]Come on now, please.
[90:38.17]And you even took the damage from it.
[90:41.24]We both walked in at the same time.
[90:44.30]Oh, we're dead.
[90:45.28]Yeah, this is not good at all.
[90:48.37]I'm just gonna throw my fucking axes at this guy.
[90:51.61]I don't know how poison works on us, though.
[90:53.39]Because it obviously doesn't do, like, five for, like... Does it do damage?
[90:57.51]I don't... We'll be going a new room, I think.
[90:59.35]It hurts us.
[91:00.25]I believe.
[91:00.75]Look at the top right.
[91:02.39]That's what I would guess as well.
[91:04.37]Makes sense, right?
[91:11.90]We came up from here.
[91:16.62]I wonder how much damage it's gonna do.
[91:18.78]Yeah, five damage.
[91:21.82]Good time to put this thing down.
[91:22.92]Yeah, please.
[91:24.46]Oh, that's so good.
[91:26.31]Please tell me it stays there for a while.
[91:29.25]I think it's however much health it has.
[91:34.49]It looks like they only attack it, too.
[91:37.08]So, that's really good.
[91:44.61]Aside from us both almost being dead and poisoned, I think we're doing pretty good.
[91:51.36]I think, maybe.
[91:53.16]Like, I really... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[91:54.66]There's a thing down here, too.
[91:56.78]That's, like, the bonus room.
[91:57.88]I don't think I want to go in there.
[91:59.00]Those are always, like, awful.
[92:01.07]Let's just take a peek.
[92:01.71]We can always run up.
[92:03.65]It's a... Oh, yeah.
[92:04.55]You wanted to skip this room.
[92:07.21]It didn't have the shop sign.
[92:08.93]Pirate sword.
[92:10.05]Every kill or destruction gives one gold.
[92:14.06]That seems really good.
[92:15.66]Yeah, that seems good.
[92:17.60]Destruction, too.
[92:18.65]Plus, I have the double gold as well.
[92:21.55]Yeah, you can just be a gold monster.
[92:23.07]Dude, do you have... Is poison a curse?
[92:27.73]Because you could get this holy water if you had enough.
[92:30.51]I don't.
[92:31.69]Because we're going to die just from entering rooms.
[92:35.63]Yep.
[92:37.12]We're both going to be almost dead when we enter the... Yeah, so we can't get hit.
[92:41.42]It's just really bad.
[92:43.34]Dead.
[92:44.88]Oh, no.
[92:47.49]That was fast.
[92:50.97]I'm so sorry.
[92:51.65]I'm dead.
[92:56.41]No, I'm not.
[92:56.75]Holy shit.
[92:57.07]I'm alive.
[92:58.21]I hit you.
[92:59.89]Well, that was you that hit me.
[93:03.56]You're not dead.
[93:04.06]No.
[93:06.68]Well done, Ms.
[93:07.34]Pauling.
[93:08.04]Indeed.
[93:08.42]You...
[93:14.36]Come on.
[93:15.00]Come on.
[93:15.70]Come on.
[93:18.98]There's no fucking way, dude.
[93:20.92]I need seven souls.
[93:24.90]If you have any more of those axes, fucking throw them.
[93:27.14]I don't.
[93:28.16]I'm just waiting to have my dummy so I can send some people out.
[93:30.98]There's a dummy over there.
[93:36.37]Go get the dummy.
[93:38.03]Oh, man.
[93:38.71]I don't have any... There was no winning that one.
[93:45.25]That- we had really good stuff at the end there, just- the fucking- that one poison room, you walk into that room and get poisoned.
[93:52.18]Yeah, that poison really screwed us.
[93:54.88]Cause we're idiots.
[93:57.16]I didn't unlock anything either, I don't think.
[93:59.66]I'm going back to adventurer, dude.
[94:04.16]I'm looking at the other classes, I just wanna see what they do.
[94:06.30]Pirate.
[94:07.18]Yeah, fucking spoiler.
[94:08.25]He's just a cannon.
[94:09.35]What- spoilers?
[94:10.29]What are you talking about?
[94:12.01]I like this class, though.
[94:13.95]It's fun.
[94:14.95]Yeah, sounds great.
[94:16.29]No, no, hold on a minute.
[94:18.13]Hold on a second.
[94:21.26]I'm gonna pretend to be you.
[94:29.36]I'm a ninja too.
[94:33.37]Oh, come on.
[94:34.53]Look how dapper you look at everything.
[94:37.39]What?
[94:39.63]What does the alchemist even do?
[94:43.83]I feel like we're missing something here.
[94:54.02]You ready?
[94:54.60]Yeah.
[94:56.91]Who needs a hat when you have a frickin' mohawk?
[95:04.37]I always take so much damage in these first rooms.
[95:07.23]It's because you get too cocky.
[95:09.67]You get super cocky, and then you end up killing yourself.
[95:11.95]I'm down to 60.
[95:14.12]I'm down to 50.
[95:15.18]And now I'm like, look at... Just die.
[95:18.72]Really?
[95:18.90]Just let them kill us.
[95:19.80]I mean, at this point, what the hell?
[95:21.58]Wow, Jermo.
[95:22.30]This is the first room.
[95:23.44]Wow, Jermo.
[95:25.10]We're literally talking about the first area in the game.
[95:30.19]Oh, wow, Jerma.
[95:31.29]You're dead in the first room?
[95:32.39]Wow, Jerma.
[95:33.61]I tried to drink a potion.
[95:34.83]Look at your guy's face.
[95:37.79]Your guy looks like, uh, Roger from Doug.
[95:42.21]There he is.
[95:45.05]It's Roger from Doug.
[95:49.35]Can I TC train?
[95:50.27]That's the one chat I've read in an hour.
[95:51.69]I'm done.
[95:52.01]Mm-hmm.
[96:05.64]Shitter.
[96:07.18]Okay, let's, like, play the game.
[96:13.90]Haven't we been doing that?
[96:16.06]Uh, you've been trying.
[96:17.28]I really wish you were the assassin, too.
[96:26.47]Ah, my gold.
[96:26.89]That guy had a lot of money.
[96:30.33]What is going on with this money?
[96:31.67]I don't know.
[96:33.73]Why did I pick up that cherry?
[96:36.36]Easy, easy, easy.
[96:37.10]Nope.
[96:42.64]Okay, kill us.
[96:44.60]Let's jump off.
[96:45.28]Start over.
[96:45.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[96:46.35]I'm down to 50.
[96:47.37]Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[96:48.13]I'm going to knock him off.
[96:50.05]No, you're not.
[96:50.43]Well, yeah, I would have knocked him off.
[96:52.35]If he'd just get on the ground, maybe.
[96:53.63]Oh, my God.
[96:55.71]I'm going to die.
[96:56.55]Oh, my God.
[97:01.76]I hate these grass levels.
[97:05.45]Are you dead?
[97:06.31]Yeah.
[97:06.75]You're dead.
[97:07.41]Don't worry about it.
[97:09.27]Dude, you're usually the first one to die every game.
[97:12.03]I always get whatever is in the first chest, because you're dead.
[97:15.55]I mean, like, wait a second.
[97:17.26]Here, we're talking about, like, this is the second room.
[97:21.74]You died in the first room, and then the second room.
[97:23.50]I didn't die in the first room.
[97:25.02]You told me to die, and I obeyed your command.
[97:27.48]You pretty much died in the second room.
[97:29.12]There's a huge chest over here.
[97:30.34]Guess what I get?
[97:31.08]Yeah, you get the, like, this is usually me.
[97:33.30]You're gonna kill yourself on this chest.
[97:35.38]Oh, yeah?
[97:35.92]What's, I can't, I don't even know.
[97:36.90]I have no idea.
[97:38.72]I might miss something.
[97:40.55]Scroll of armor.
[97:43.85]That seemed like a really good chest.
[97:47.95]Oh, you got the extra life thing?
[97:50.75]I just did.
[97:51.13]Look, a magic up there as well.
[97:54.10]Is that it?
[97:59.44]I guess that's it.
[98:01.63]I haven't seen this before.
[98:02.61]Yeah, we did.
[98:06.05]Wait, no.
[98:07.21]No, we didn't.
[98:09.55]I need eight people to die.
[98:11.65]You can just leave these guys behind, too, apparently.
[98:15.69]Well, they're easy.
[98:16.77]You need eight people to die.
[98:17.71]There's four here instantly.
[98:19.99]Yes.
[98:25.30]Yeah, I mean, I guess.
[98:26.42]I need three now.
[98:28.12]I mean, like, those are three.
[98:29.42]Can you kill them?
[98:31.51]I haven't taken one hit yet.
[98:32.89]You would have already died by now.
[98:37.19]I was just gonna walk off.
[98:39.27]Okay.
[98:49.94]What would you do without me?
[98:53.28]Probably go to bed.
[98:57.22]Eh.
[98:59.82]This doesn't seem like a terrible idea.
[99:03.95]I assume this game can't be played single player.
[99:05.81]Yes, you can.
[99:06.83]You can play this single player.
[99:08.95]Just seems like easier and probably more fun with co-op.
[99:13.17]Yeah, I don't think I'd like this game as much as I've liked it so far without a friend.
[99:17.55]Is that what you're calling me now?
[99:23.83]Usually I'm your enemy.
[99:25.33]Whatever, dude!
[99:29.78]Insta-kill.
[99:51.21]Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
[99:52.00]Got you.
[99:58.73]You kill him.
[100:01.01]Yeah cause yeah. Oh yeah okay.
[100:02.15]I was trying to be cute.
[100:03.63]Oh yeah trying to be cute over here. Well guess what? You're not.
[100:16.51]I had it too.
[100:20.19]Easy, easy, easy.
[100:21.98]There's a lot of stuff here.
[100:25.88]Oh, what's this fucking armor?
[100:27.86]That's what I'm saying, easy.
[100:29.38]Dragon armor, immune to fire, and it blocks five hits.
[100:33.78]Cudgel.
[100:34.30]I don't even... And a rusty-ass sword.
[100:37.27]Oh, the gladius.
[100:38.91]I like the gladius.
[100:39.71]I took the first spell damage one, I might as well take the next one, and it's possible.
[100:43.65]I'll take the armor then.
[100:44.57]Alright.
[100:46.87]We good?
[100:47.97]We friends?
[100:48.49]We're good.
[100:50.96]Do I look like a dead ass work?
[100:53.30]No, you look like one of the guys from the Legion of Doom in WWF.
[100:59.86]Roger from Doug joined the Legion of Doom.
[101:03.14]I don't remember Legion of Doom.
[101:06.46]Oh, they had those shoulders.
[101:10.78]Who else was in the Legion of Doom?
[101:11.92]Uh, there's two guys.
[101:15.62]I forget what their names were.
[101:17.80]Don't.
[101:19.29]I'm not going to.
[101:22.41]I couldn't get out with it.
[101:27.71]Got an achievement?
[101:29.21]Executioner?
[101:32.72]I don't know.
[101:33.12]Alright, can you do it now?
[101:36.30]Can you handle it?
[101:36.96]Oh, you already did it.
[101:38.20]I don't know.
[101:40.74]You're the one with the assassinate.
[101:43.12]Well, I thought you were going to throw the bomb at everybody.
[101:47.05]Sorry.
[101:49.93]I'm the one with the assassinate.
[101:51.13]Oh.
[101:52.05]Dammit.
[101:55.83]I like the potion drink sound.
[101:57.57]Makes me want to drink.
[101:58.51]Very good sound design.
[102:04.95]I'm having a really hard time doing the dash.
[102:07.12]I don't know what I'm doing wrong anymore.
[102:08.48]Until, like, I think I know what it is.
[102:14.36]Shit.
[102:14.72]Didn't think that guy was running right at me.
[102:23.32]That guy wants to kill you so bad.
[102:29.16]Oh my god, he does.
[102:31.42]I couldn't stop that guy.
[102:35.83]Alright, up here.
[102:36.81]I think it's only 13.
[102:42.77]That's just a fucking shit sword.
[102:49.89]I'm going to get this thing again.
[102:52.01]super coin spend coins to get coins coin men I'm gonna let you pick them up then I have 20. that's true not really it's better than what I have not really can we can we let's go you didn't even know about that one what how did you even get that
[103:21.46]I had a little scroll.
[103:22.82]Oh, for random armor.
[103:24.00]I'm immune to explosions.
[103:26.20]Does it have a durability on it?
[103:27.32]Nope.
[103:28.89]I think I'm just immune to explosions forever.
[103:31.49]Mine was immune to fire, so... I guess we're both cool now.
[103:35.45]Like, we can agree on that.
[103:36.75]Okay, you're just going to let me get every single one of those, I guess?
[103:46.69]Because you get the double gold thing.
[103:48.58]They look immune to explosions.
[103:49.62]What do you say?
[103:51.96]That's awesome.
[103:54.30]Actually, it's really awesome.
[103:55.50]A lot of the times we've died has been because there's so much of that shit laying around.
[103:59.89]You want to do the honors?
[104:15.10]What's that?
[104:16.78]Regeneration, plus three.
[104:18.34]Mine.
[104:20.78]I'll take the stupid magic missiles again.
[104:24.60]Do you want the rum?
[104:25.74]No.
[104:26.08]I have removes all things.
[104:30.34]This is going- We have really shitty weapons, but otherwise we're getting a lot of good stuff.
[104:34.60]Yeah.
[104:45.63]Anyhow, we can just walk out of these rooms.
[104:47.45]I don't know why we're actually fighting them all.
[104:52.77]Because they drop money and shit.
[104:56.21]Yes.
[105:03.16]I could have sworn these doors were locked before, though.
[105:04.94]I don't know.
[105:07.86]I'm going to be into explosions, so this will be fun.
[105:12.02]Is that just the end of the level?
[105:13.80]I guess.
[105:14.62]Alright.
[105:17.12]Someone says you're the Hamburglar.
[105:27.65]I'm the Hamburglar when he gets to be about 45 years old.
[105:32.39]And he's still the Hamburglar.
[105:35.89]What a dumb character.
[105:36.87]Think about it.
[105:37.85]This is a character who stole hamburgers.
[105:41.76]That's it.
[105:42.34]That's all he was.
[105:43.38]He just took hamburgers.
[105:44.00]Watch out for these poisons.
[105:46.46]I'm taking this.
[105:48.54]What does it even do?
[105:49.18]Uh, it's a whirlwind.
[105:52.91]As I'm understanding it.
[105:54.57]We're both dead.
[105:56.85]Oh yeah?
[105:58.53]Whoops.
[106:00.39]We're both dead.
[106:01.07]Why not?
[106:02.91]I'm just gonna throw bombs all over me.
[106:05.63]No, I mean, like, we're never going to get across this, even after we kill these guys.
[106:11.19]I panicked and tried to jump.
[106:13.54]Why did you just insta- Oh, because of a- Oh, oh yeah.
[106:19.56]So yeah, can we even do this?
[106:20.70]I don't know.
[106:22.58]I don't know.
[106:24.16]I just tried to do it, and it didn't work.
[106:25.94]I might have just been panicking, though.
[106:28.92]Here we go.
[106:30.58]Oh, yeah, you can.
[106:32.42]Be careful.
[106:34.91]That's so scary.
[106:36.21]That's unnecessarily scary.
[106:39.05]I don't want to be near you hitting those either.
[106:42.89]Nice health, fucking loser.
[106:45.49]I'm the Hamburglar.
[106:46.17]Don't you know that was my character?
[106:48.98]Alright, I'll give you that one.
[106:50.40]You like these big hammers.
[106:51.36]You still want one?
[106:53.18]I'm a little guy now.
[106:57.56]Another spell damage book.
[106:58.84]I'll be taking that.
[107:02.84]Let's see.
[107:03.12]It removes all your curses.
[107:04.80]You take that.
[107:06.24]You seem to be complaining about curse guy, so you take that.
[107:08.82]Hey.
[107:10.12]No one wants this?
[107:12.38]I'll take it if you don't want it.
[107:14.04]I don't want it.
[107:14.48]I mean, that's a stun on critical hit.
[107:22.16]You didn't even... Okay, come over here.
[107:23.66]This is mini demon.
[107:24.62]Fires fireballs randomly.
[107:26.32]You want that?
[107:32.15]I actually really didn't see that.
[107:35.79]I really swear to god thought I didn't make that.
[107:38.57]Yeah, I thought you just wanted me to jump back over so I would die.
[107:42.66]Too bad none of us has that thing.
[107:44.56]The float.
[107:46.50]One of us can destroy shields really easily.
[107:51.12]Wouldn't mind if he did it.
[107:53.50]I have running forever.
[107:55.12]Oh, you're dead.
[107:56.56]You're dead!
[107:59.00]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:00.00]Come over here.
[108:01.80]Take that.
[108:06.05]Thank God.
[108:07.29]That really is, like, the worst.
[108:08.43]Thank God.
[108:10.09]Dude, I'm doing 40 damage per hit.
[108:12.99]Who's gonna... Who's going for it?
[108:15.39]I have less health, so I'm gonna do it.
[108:17.56]Alright, you go for it.
[108:18.84]Good luck.
[108:21.28]All the stuff I'm gonna unlock is just gonna, like, fall in a hole.
[108:25.44]No, it's not.
[108:26.22]They actually, uh, they made the...
[108:30.84]I tried.
[108:31.82]I really did try.
[108:36.20]I really did.
[108:38.14]Oh, fuck.
[108:39.94]You're, you got full health.
[108:42.66]Yeah, I'll be alright.
[108:44.34]Don't worry about me.
[108:50.63]And I'm randomly, like, my mini-demon's still doing it.
[108:53.69]That's cool.
[108:56.63]Don't, don't you dare hamburger it.
[108:58.41]Don't get away from that, I'm a hamburger.
[109:02.20]Disgusting.
[109:03.20]Disgusting.
[109:04.64]Let's go.
[109:08.82]The hamburger who doesn't like hamburgers.
[109:12.34]No, that was a chicken I was talking about.
[109:14.64]I would get that scroll for the boss again.
[109:17.44]Flux?
[109:18.62]That's what covers up the ground.
[109:22.94]Ooh.
[109:25.48]That's kind of cool.
[109:27.62]That is really, really good.
[109:28.76]I don't know if that's worth 84.
[109:32.62]I'd say it is you really want that axe over this like who cares does more damage whatever let's go I mean who cares those eight it's it it's fucking but you just let me hamburger and you do you I'm a ghost I can't do me well I'm trying to collect health
[109:55.90]You have... You have it.
[109:57.94]Money.
[109:58.62]Money.
[109:59.46]Money.
[109:59.72]Let me help you there.
[110:01.50]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[110:11.27]Why is it hurting you?
[110:12.41]Because I don't like it.
[110:14.11]It's not a hamburger.
[110:15.53]I need five things to die.
[110:17.00]Can we work on that?
[110:22.90]We can work on that.
[110:29.67]This thing is so slow.
[110:30.59]Yeah, that's why I was doing jump attacks almost all the time with it.
[110:36.83]Oh, come on.
[110:44.54]Can I get three kills here?
[110:46.36]Can maybe three of these things die?
[110:47.80]These guys are giving me a pain in the ass because they shoot at bows.
[110:53.36]Every time they go for a bow shot, I'll hit them.
[111:01.42]Hey, look who's back.
[111:02.06]I'm supposed to be immune to explosions.
[111:05.02]Why am I getting hurt by those?
[111:07.43]Are you?
[111:09.33]Maybe I'm not.
[111:09.87]Maybe I'm just crazy.
[111:11.17]You still have it.
[111:14.45]There wasn't a durability on it.
[111:20.04]It seems like you still have a lot of health.
[111:22.60]I do.
[111:23.84]Thanks for noticing.
[111:27.50]Yikes.
[111:30.14]Watch out.
[111:32.35]That's a pretty good bomb, if I do say so myself.
[111:34.55]Okay, don't get poisoned by these losers.
[111:38.47]Shit.
[111:43.09]Dude, I bet Whirlwind is actually really sick with, like, that weapon.
[111:46.72]Because it would still swing fast.
[111:50.76]Yeah.
[111:53.10]Unless there's, like, a second Whirlwind damage.
[111:55.98]I'm glad I can attack out of stealth.
[112:01.12]No!
[112:02.52]I insta-killed him.
[112:03.34]He's my friend!
[112:03.94]No he wasn't.
[112:06.67]Please.
[112:07.01]Oh my god, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[112:21.00]Can someone with a sledgehammer, like, destroy these?
[112:22.85]Oh, you don't have a sledgehammer.
[112:24.79]I got him.
[112:25.71]I can't do that dash anymore!
[112:28.01]I can't do it!
[112:28.95]I don't know where I am.
[112:32.61]I was invisible.
[112:33.31]I seriously did not know what I was doing.
[112:46.46]Damn it.
[112:49.14]I thought your red health bar from you being invisible was like a poison dart.
[112:57.08]I am not doing well in this room.
[113:01.70]I can't do it.
[113:03.52]I'm an incompetent gamer.
[113:06.83]I'm just having trouble with the explosions.
[113:12.21]Watch out, watch out.
[113:27.04]Let me just slice this guy's throat.
[113:29.52]Motherfucker.
[113:35.96]We're both almost dead again.
[113:37.66]Yeah, we are.
[113:38.79]But usually in these first rooms, there's a lot of hamburgers that I wish someone hadn't eaten.
[113:47.87]Easy.
[113:48.15]Let me handle this.
[113:48.67]Clear.
[114:01.72]Claire.
[114:03.54]Claire.
[114:04.06]What a Bostonian over here.
[114:05.94]Claire.
[114:14.40]I'm sure someone would come assassinate these guys.
[114:17.92]I have six health.
[114:19.98]Knock him in the air.
[114:21.88]Watch out.
[114:23.62]What?
[114:23.80]Uh, he's wearing armor.
[114:26.54]So?
[114:26.74]Oh, he has a shield?
[114:28.91]Does that matter?
[114:31.16]How do we get rid of his shield?
[114:35.14]Can we not?
[114:35.62]Do we have to do it multiple times?
[114:37.52]I can't.
[114:38.22]I cannot do it anymore at all.
[114:40.16]Alright, it's gone.
[114:42.66]It's gone.
[114:43.00]I got him.
[114:44.02]He's dead.
[114:45.94]I don't know.
[114:49.54]Okay.
[114:50.79]Apparently I never knew how to do it.
[114:52.91]What happened?
[114:53.31]Oh, running.
[114:54.79]You see what I'm doing?
[114:56.91]I see what you're doing.
[114:59.46]We have to go up here.
[115:01.08]Oh my, no.
[115:02.32]No.
[115:03.60]No, we're dead.
[115:04.58]Wait, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[115:08.36]I don't know what to do.
[115:09.90]I'm gonna die.
[115:11.14]I have to keep running, dude.
[115:12.18]It's over.
[115:13.18]It's over.
[115:13.64]What did you do?
[115:14.98]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[115:17.96]What did you do that... I drank the fucking health potion that... We're gonna be okay.
[115:26.53]We're gonna be okay.
[115:31.61]Keep him over there, please.
[115:32.45]Please keep him over there.
[115:35.25]I'm doing my best.
[115:36.79]Be careful!
[115:41.39]Dude, this guy has the fucking always running... Thank god I had that scroll, otherwise this seriously would be over.
[115:52.98]That was some quick thinking.
[115:54.60]I forgot you had that.
[115:56.33]Well, now we don't have it for the boss.
[115:58.11]If we see that same boss again.
[116:00.41]Here's some health.
[116:03.00]Can you open that while you're running?
[116:04.50]I don't know.
[116:06.24]I don't know.
[116:09.60]I don't think you can.
[116:11.52]Either way, I need you to kill seven people.
[116:15.10]Yep, I can.
[116:17.73]Please don't screw this up.
[116:22.35]Uh...
[116:24.18]I'll read what they do.
[116:25.06]Uh, Heroic Blake.
[116:27.26]Please read what they do.
[116:28.06]Blocks all hits, 7 durability, critical chance, plus 15.
[116:31.56]I would pick that up.
[116:33.06]Okay.
[116:33.34]Uh, there's a ring, critical hit chance, plus 5%.
[116:38.77]The Morning Star is, you know what that is.
[116:41.05]And then there's a scroll of random armor.
[116:45.03]Just grab the armor, grab the ring, and then go.
[116:55.13]Oh, you're not immune to explosions anymore.
[116:56.87]Remember that as well.
[117:00.17]This is a fucking nightmare.
[117:02.57]This is a nightmare.
[117:05.91]That is the worst disease thing ever.
[117:09.60]You need to be able to... My god.
[117:15.94]I hit you too.
[117:20.54]No.
[117:22.73]No.
[117:23.77]Okay, can we... Listen.
[117:24.99]You know I'm run guy.
[117:26.23]We were dead the second you got run guy.
[117:37.49]Let's just go.
[117:38.09]No, I actually do want to look at something.
[117:41.99]I'm curious.
[117:46.01]What other challenges need to happen?
[117:48.44]So we can do caster guy.
[117:54.95]Battle mage, okay.
[117:56.45]Complete adaptive magic scribbler.
[117:58.23]Alright, so I need to find six more books of magic and the battle mage unlocks.
[118:05.40]That's a lot.
[118:06.14]Well, let's just go.
[118:08.67]We'll do it just by playing.
[118:10.41]All of these achievements are just play the game and it'll happen.
[118:13.03]Hold on.
[118:13.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[118:14.31]That was a very unlucky outfit, I would say.
[118:16.33]Yeah.
[118:17.71]That was a pretty unlucky run.
[118:18.77]You get a different outfit.
[118:26.13]How do you unlock these other ones?
[118:27.99]I'll have to beat the game.
[118:29.25]My guy is as stupid as you could look.
[118:34.18]We're both Beavis from Beavis and Butter.
[118:35.88]Did we really just do that?
[118:38.62]We both- oh wait.
[118:39.58]I'm gonna be like the witch.
[118:44.08]I unlocked that guy from Left 4 Dead that says the Pills line that is named after pills.
[118:49.34]Pills meme.
[118:50.62]Meme.
[118:54.02]Come on, I need something to go with this.
[119:01.26]Okay, Jerma.
[119:05.09]No, I don't like this.
[119:06.40]I'm going back to, uh... I'm going back to the witch.
[119:10.42]The wicked witch of the west.
[119:11.70]People are pissed off you're not the Hamburglar guy.
[119:14.12]Let's go.
[119:15.22]You know what?
[119:15.62]You're right.
[119:16.08]Oh my god!
[119:16.98]You can't be the Hamburglar because you're not gonna get the mask again.
[119:19.52]You know what?
[119:19.96]And when you're right, you're right.
[119:20.86]Oh my... Can we go?
[119:22.12]Alright, I'll be the Hamburglar Stan Marsh.
[119:28.81]Let's go.
[119:32.83]Like, if there's not a chest...
[119:34.85]Restock.
[119:35.89]No chest.
[119:36.35]If there's not a chest in these areas, let's just run through and not kill the enemies for these first ones.
[119:40.34]Like, fuck these guys.
[119:41.40]There's no chest.
[119:47.88]Chest.
[119:54.35]Oh god, they can hit you up there.
[119:56.13]Yes, they can.
[119:56.53]I don't like this little area.
[120:00.01]This area sucks.
[120:01.79]Well, there goes like half my health.
[120:03.99]Don't worry, I'm almost dead too.
[120:21.12]I do it.
[120:23.30]Okay.
[120:23.58]You wanna do it again?
[120:33.83]Oh, finally that was my chest opening achievement.
[120:40.84]We're dead here.
[120:46.42]You can just ignore him and he'll slowly die.
[120:50.49]Wait, do we even have to fight these again?
[120:53.13]Oh, there's a chest over here.
[120:54.47]Yeah, there's a chest and I think the big guys have a chance to drop good stuff.
[121:00.87]At least good enough.
[121:03.94]I guess not.
[121:09.00]We're getting bold.
[121:10.90]Yeah, you are.
[121:14.64]Fire immunity?
[121:17.08]That's really cool.
[121:17.86]Oh, and there's some socks for you.
[121:19.94]Let me see.
[121:21.60]So don't trigger traps.
[121:22.62]Don't trigger traps.
[121:23.64]Give me that.
[121:24.12]Thank God.
[121:26.10]That's like the bane of my existence in this game.
[121:28.86]Oh, we're off to like already a better start than last time anyway.
[121:31.88]Yes, we are.
[121:37.02]Are we going to kill these guys or not?
[121:40.18]I mean, we're here already.
[121:41.36]We're not going to get very much money if that's the route you want to take.
[121:44.26]Yeah, money hasn't really done too much for us anyway.
[121:48.36]Yeah, but the one time that we find an item that we want, it's not going to go so well.
[121:53.45]I guess.
[121:54.55]Pairs.
[122:01.81]I mean, they did drop a lot, I suppose.
[122:05.19]I suppose.
[122:05.53]I think everyone does that.
[122:06.69]Yeah.
[122:07.50]But a lot of them do.
[122:15.82]Boink, boink, boink.
[122:22.42]Yum.
[122:24.94]Yeah, I'm just gonna get rid of the I get diseased potion.
[122:30.82]Why?
[122:31.92]Why?
[122:32.18]I would actually like to win one of these.
[122:40.31]Is there a benefit to you?
[122:41.67]Like, is there a plus to that item?
[122:42.93]I have not seen a single plus side yet.
[122:45.97]Every time has been a random disease.
[122:51.34]So many enemies just died because they fell.
[122:53.12]That was great.
[122:54.68]Watch out, bomb.
[123:03.86]yikes oh boy there's a big chest in here big big big big big big money big money yeah I know stay away from me what a moron alright just so you know
[123:30.96]He says, what a moron.
[123:32.38]He says, what a moron.
[123:34.18]What did you just say to me?
[123:35.92]What did you say to me?
[123:37.74]My feet are on fire.
[123:39.96]Oh, yeah.
[123:40.60]Okay.
[123:41.24]What a moron.
[123:42.16]What a moron.
[123:43.68]My feet are on fire.
[123:45.89]I dare you to walk near me.
[123:48.31]I want that chicken nugget.
[123:49.53]You want that chicken, don't you?
[123:50.89]I dare you to come get it.
[123:53.81]Did you just fart again?
[123:58.77]No.
[123:59.65]Don't hit me.
[124:03.48]Listen.
[124:07.04]I will walk off this cliff.
[124:08.92]Yeah.
[124:09.86]Yeah.
[124:12.54]Look at all that cool stuff.
[124:25.11]Okay, now that we've determined that fire, it blows things up.
[124:30.40]There's chicken down here.
[124:31.65]Can you destroy it?
[124:32.67]You're a ghost.
[124:33.21]I can't.
[124:34.89]Damn it.
[124:35.15]I was hoping that wasn't going to work.
[124:38.53]Look at all that money.
[124:40.27]I'm irritated now.
[124:41.85]I'm not.
[124:43.27]Look at all this fucking money you're getting.
[124:45.01]Irritated.
[124:45.47]Okay.
[124:47.43]Jesus.
[124:48.70]More money.
[124:49.36]You're just not even picking it all up.
[124:50.70]Yeah, because my shoes are too cool.
[124:55.60]Open these.
[124:56.28]Open them.
[125:17.52]You always get bored in co-op games and, like, kill me.
[125:20.30]It happens in every game we play.
[125:23.24]Like, I'm bored now.
[125:24.26]I'm going to, like... What have you done?
[125:26.87]What did I do?
[125:28.81]I was trying to deal with the... Look at this.
[125:31.43]This is great.
[125:32.67]You get another full gold chest.
[125:34.71]I'm very happy for you.
[125:36.17]Isn't this going to revive you from killing these guys?
[125:38.21]I need to kill five more people.
[125:44.45]Here we go.
[125:45.19]Here we go.
[125:45.95]Come on.
[125:51.57]I'm growing old over here.
[125:52.57]Come on, man.
[126:00.51]I'm so sick of you.
[126:02.17]I can't see who I'm fighting.
[126:11.79]I don't even care.
[126:14.87]Yes, you do.
[126:15.57]No, I saw what it was and it was nothing I wanted.
[126:18.13]Yeah, it was nothing.
[126:18.79]It was not really that good.
[126:22.47]I'm like trying to leave you behind.
[126:23.85]No, don't leave me.
[126:26.67]I really just like had enough of your shit.
[126:46.02]Dude, what a troll.
[126:48.30]God, I just trolled you.
[126:56.90]Oh my god, I'm taking a lot of damage.
[127:04.30]Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.
[127:16.37]Come on, bullshit.
[127:18.91]Can you do your job and assassinate one of these guys?
[127:22.13]I just did it to a guy down there.
[127:28.53]Haunted Inn.
[127:29.39]Look, there's a ghost.
[127:30.07]Can we talk to him?
[127:35.21]Uh, no.
[127:35.53]When we open this chest, everyone's probably gonna, like, slay us.
[127:39.17]Well, remember, don't drink out of this.
[127:46.25]Remember to kill everything before they grow legs and start punching us.
[127:50.37]Okay, well.
[127:53.30]Did I find that offensive, what you just did?
[127:58.53]I find that offensive.
[128:01.76]You took a hamburger from the Hamburglar without even asking?
[128:06.12]Is that error a network desync because we're in the ghost room?
[128:09.88]Or is the network really desyncing?
[128:13.42]I don't see anything you're talking about.
[128:19.00]I still see you running around.
[128:20.08]I just have like a giant flashing network desync on my screen.
[128:25.15]Can you leave the room?
[128:26.99]Yeah, can you?
[128:28.33]Yeah.
[128:28.83]I'm still seeing everything you're doing.
[128:31.69]I'm swinging, right?
[128:33.41]Yeah.
[128:34.67]Alright.
[128:35.41]I don't know.
[128:36.73]Maybe... I swear that's what the haunted chest did to me.
[128:41.17]It's just like it's trying to freak me out.
[128:44.50]For the next couple of rooms, it's just going to try and play mind games on me.
[128:53.24]I got a thing over there.
[128:54.00]Just capitalize on it.
[129:05.62]Shit, that guy hurts.
[129:09.72]How do you think it is for him?
[129:17.50]Probably hurts.
[129:22.48]Actually, this probably is one of the curses.
[129:24.14]We haven't been cursed yet.
[129:25.10]What do you mean?
[129:27.82]There's curses and there's diseases.
[129:29.50]Curses are different.
[129:30.66]There's an achievement for curing a curse as well.
[129:33.39]So error network desync is definitely one of the curses.
[129:38.39]Or your network error desynced.
[129:42.29]It's gone now.
[129:49.75]Do these guys come to life if you hit them enough?
[129:52.65]I think in some of the other areas they moved, I don't think they always do.
[129:55.35]Kind of like the tables aren't always people.
[129:58.43]Sure.
[130:09.53]Oh, come on.
[130:10.17]I was going to assassinate this guy.
[130:20.07]Michael!
[130:22.72]I actually have a lot of gold.
[130:24.82]We need to find a shop.
[130:26.46]I have about 68.
[130:27.90]I have exactly 68.
[130:28.58]Throw some fireballs into your enemies.
[130:30.64]You're a fire guy.
[130:31.92]You might as well take that if you're going to be fireman.
[130:33.56]Sure.
[130:37.96]Remember, you can't get hurt by traps.
[130:39.80]That's this run, right?
[130:41.44]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[130:47.32]Hey, I can't get hurt by traps.
[130:48.54]I'll take care of the people over here.
[130:51.96]Or at least as many of them as I can.
[131:01.62]Wow.
[131:02.22]Okay, I can still fall.
[131:03.66]Yeah, you can.
[131:06.87]I don't want to break their shields.
[131:08.51]I'll fly off the edge.
[131:12.43]Watch out.
[131:12.83]I'm going to throw axes.
[131:15.13]That's a lot of axes.
[131:22.27]Damn it.
[131:22.57]We're in a bad spot.
[131:26.79]What?
[131:27.03]Come on.
[131:28.41]That's a terrible spawn.
[131:30.30]I forgot there were traps over here.
[131:32.70]I don't want to be here.
[131:34.26]No, you don't.
[131:34.70]You want to get out of here.
[131:38.95]I really need this to... Did you just fall off?
[131:42.57]No.
[131:45.15]Yeah, you did!
[131:47.03]I got hit by... a guy throwing a knife.
[131:52.11]He threw it across the map, and hit me right in the back of the head.
[131:54.51]Oh my god.
[131:58.03]That's what happened.
[131:58.80]No, what, what?
[132:02.06]You know, just keep doing that.
[132:03.14]Just, just, just... I'm gonna try to knock them in the abyss.
[132:08.25]I'll be able to do that.
[132:09.51]At least like these couple guys.
[132:14.33]What the hell?
[132:15.11]Come on now.
[132:16.65]Ow!
[132:17.27]Those knives are not friendly knives.
[132:19.90]Wanna try?
[132:21.48]Wanna try?
[132:21.82]It's just an awkward room.
[132:31.02]I'll try to kill him.
[132:33.21]Watch out.
[132:34.07]Don't unnecessarily get killed here.
[132:37.47]I just need him to like get in the right spot.
[132:39.39]Like right there.
[132:42.07]Come on.
[132:45.61]Can you like take a step up?
[132:47.93]So he like walks up towards you.
[132:49.11]He's like sprinting at you.
[132:53.01]Okay.
[132:53.31]There we go.
[132:54.35]Now he's dead.
[132:55.95]Is he?
[132:56.29]No.
[132:56.97]No.
[132:57.77]You stand like a- Knock him down again.
[132:59.51]Knock him down again.
[133:00.61]Just keep hitting him.
[133:01.23]Just keep hitting him!
[133:04.03]You can't move around because he pats to you.
[133:07.39]Don't hit him when he's on the ground, because I can just pick him up then.
[133:11.89]I'm going to die.
[133:12.81]I'm going to die.
[133:15.81]If you mess this... Yeah, you don't mess it up.
[133:19.11]Thank God.
[133:25.06]I heard you guys say... I was looking away.
[133:26.40]I heard you guys say, I thought it was over.
[133:32.94]Okay, let's see if this helps.
[133:35.29]Three things need to die.
[133:37.43]It's a couple of Danny Trejos and some... You got this.
[133:40.83]Watch out, watch out for the scary guy.
[133:43.73]Killed three people.
[133:45.13]How'd you get full health?
[133:45.83]Uh, I got one of those, um, from that chest.
[133:48.98]The 50 health and I got bone weakness.
[133:51.12]Alright, here I come.
[133:53.30]Okay, that was scary there for a bit.
[133:56.12]That's why I like this game and gentlemen watching.
[133:59.13]It's tense.
[134:01.35]Ooh. 140.
[134:06.97]Holy shit.
[134:07.75]Is that the fire immune?
[134:10.21]No, that's something entirely different.
[134:12.95]Oh, regains durability after.
[134:14.23]That's really good.
[134:15.87]So hold on, blocks all hits.
[134:17.05]That means you can't take damage?
[134:18.85]Look it, you won't take any damage, right?
[134:20.75]Yeah, if you... Unless it's like a spell?
[134:24.81]Yeah.
[134:26.14]How much money do you have?
[134:29.10]I'm gonna buy a guardian angel.
[134:31.98]I have 98. 98.
[134:38.12]I'll get the mask.
[134:41.42]Weak bones do exactly... We don't know what anything does exactly in this game.
[134:44.66]I'm going to assume weak bones mean to take more damage.
[134:49.18]I really want this.
[134:51.40]It's too bad.
[134:52.08]I'm not money guy this round.
[134:55.88]Yeah.
[134:56.30]The one time we actually see things you can buy with money.
[134:59.48]Yeah.
[135:00.54]It's too bad you're not money guy.
[135:02.80]Let him go up there.
[135:04.82]And then just kind of focus him.
[135:10.73]This is a bad room.
[135:12.47]There's too many, uh, potential to be... No one's dead.
[135:21.57]Too much potential to be, uh... They're running in... What I'm trying to say is they're running in circles, and it's not good for us.
[135:29.26]Oh, this room's interesting.
[135:31.76]Talk about the juggernaut guys.
[135:34.80]Oh, I'm the juggernaut, bitch!
[135:36.25]Ha ha ha ha ha, mem.
[135:42.74]That's a lot of axes.
[135:46.66]Give me this.
[135:49.53]That was bold.
[135:51.13]It was.
[135:57.83]It's better than what I have.
[135:59.95]I'm fire guy.
[136:02.21]What's that?
[136:02.59]Levitation.
[136:05.14]Now is that scroll levitation?
[136:06.44]Is that just for one?
[136:07.24]That's gonna be for probably only a few rooms, so don't use that unless you have to.
[136:11.54]Yeah.
[136:13.12]And don't touch the murky water.
[136:16.12]Hey, look at the traps.
[136:17.88]I'm totally fine here.
[136:20.13]Okay, well, I'm not, so good luck.
[136:22.53]These guys all have armor.
[136:28.39]They all have it, don't they?
[136:29.41]It's annoying.
[136:33.82]They just knock me down.
[136:39.08]They're very much health.
[136:40.66]Yeah, and I'm playing really passive in this room.
[136:44.81]How annoying would this be if you didn't have that?
[136:49.05]Pretty annoying.
[136:53.21]You're getting frisky with these.
[136:54.57]I am.
[136:58.57]Yes, I am.
[137:03.63]I wish that was health.
[137:06.93]No, this is not going to be good.
[137:09.10]Why was that one run that we did, there were so many barrel and armor and people?
[137:13.22]We haven't seen any of those anymore.
[137:15.87]Yeah.
[137:16.21]Those were like common enemies earlier.
[137:19.59]Random, uh... Random is random, as they say.
[137:25.46]Nope.
[137:26.56]That was a goblet too, and you just stole that from me.
[137:29.08]Yeah, fuck off.
[137:29.96]I didn't steal it.
[137:31.30]You can still get it if you want.
[137:33.34]No, I can't, because we can't go backwards.
[137:37.07]Can you not?
[137:38.73]I actually hadn't tried.
[137:46.73]Where are you?
[137:47.69]I was picking up coins.
[137:53.96]Headless horseman.
[137:56.02]Ow!
[137:58.76]Oh, you can't fit there.
[137:59.56]Yeah, you can't fit there.
[138:10.65]Oh, jeez.
[138:11.35]Yeah, I'm getting massacred.
[138:15.88]I'm dead.
[138:16.90]Whoa, whoa!
[138:17.76]Those guys hit like a truck.
[138:19.32]You can't just suddenly be dead.
[138:21.60]Oh, yes you can.
[138:22.26]Because they do like 10 or 12 damage a hit.
[138:27.47]Yes, we're dead.
[138:28.65]You can't just... you can't... I wanted... Oh, I have one of those!
[138:33.01]Oh my god.
[138:33.61]I forgot about this!
[138:35.49]Oh, wow.
[138:38.04]We're so lucky!
[138:40.18]Not lucky, I had the gold for it, man.
[138:43.01]Well, we live to see another day.
[138:44.99]Wow, I'm so good at this game.
[138:56.17]Like, I had a troll face on.
[138:57.27]Did you?
[138:59.54]I just wanna point that out, yes.
[139:00.86]The painting.
[139:05.39]This is good.
[139:07.49]This better not be like a boss.
[139:10.89]I'm going to revive you.
[139:12.19]Yeah.
[139:12.51]That's probably a good idea.
[139:17.54]I mean, assuming there's enemies in this game.
[139:23.34]Curse, that's a good thing to know.
[139:29.41]There.
[139:29.53]There.
[139:32.42]That's the jumping disease as well.
[139:35.16]Well, revive me, come get it.
[139:39.67]Trap room, and something we've never seen before at the end.
[139:43.11]Good luck.
[139:44.31]I'm gonna keep these guys over here.
[139:45.99]As much as I can.
[139:51.03]These three dudes should move from this spot.
[139:53.03]Hopefully not.
[139:55.87]Oh, god.
[139:57.07]New priority, sorry.
[139:58.84]Yeah.
[140:00.34]He's just jumping.
[140:01.10]There's not much I can do about him.
[140:02.71]I'm back.
[140:04.35]Hooray.
[140:05.23]And I'm trap guy.
[140:11.80]Yeah.
[140:12.24]Understand if I can't help that much.
[140:15.20]Understood.
[140:16.04]Jeez, man.
[140:18.90]Poison.
[140:30.69]At least that guy's on fire.
[140:31.51]There's a lot of people in here.
[140:32.59]This is ridiculous.
[140:33.61]I know.
[140:33.89]Some of these rooms are just bonkers.
[140:36.03]With, like, traps everywhere and, like, no room to fight them.
[140:47.18]I'm, like, so close to dying.
[140:49.40]This guy is just... There's no one to jump to.
[140:51.74]This guy's just killing me.
[140:55.78]Oh, my goodness.
[140:56.26]Don't fight him if you don't have to.
[140:57.26]I can fireball him.
[140:58.98]No, it's good.
[140:59.48]I have a thing down there now.
[141:03.87]Wow, wow, wow.
[141:08.47]He's been jumping around.
[141:10.07]Really, he killed... I told you to just ignore him.
[141:12.29]So, we're fine.
[141:15.27]No.
[141:16.63]We're worse than we were before.
[141:18.23]Dude, that room was so horrible.
[141:21.55]Is it worth it?
[141:22.29]What are they?
[141:23.91]It's not worth it.
[141:25.81]I have fire... Like, the fire thing is too good.
[141:30.03]What was this?
[141:31.33]That's the double jump.
[141:33.63]Oh, dude, we're fucking dead.
[141:35.12]This room's gonna be bonkers.
[141:36.02]Dude, we just had to kill, like, 15.
[141:38.04]Like, there was probably 20 people in that room, and I just did that.
[141:41.22]Yeah, I just did that.
[141:44.10]Oh, no.
[141:45.70]These ogres are the worst.
[141:47.27]If I could just get them stuck.
[141:50.27]Hit them down.
[141:50.71]There we go.
[141:51.27]Oops, I accidentally drank that.
[141:52.21]The ogre's dead.
[141:55.03]I did a thing.
[141:55.65]He's dead.
[142:01.15]How many more people do you need?
[142:03.97]Seven.
[142:05.73]Only seven.
[142:08.04]Look at what I found.
[142:08.70]Get in here.
[142:11.08]We still have to go back and do that Iron Maiden thing.
[142:13.60]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[142:16.64]That's very helpful.
[142:21.93]This room is bad.
[142:23.65]Oh, this is that... You're gonna die here.
[142:30.10]I mean, it's like... Not before I kill seven people.
[142:32.79]Well, let's hope you do it.
[142:35.03]I don't know even who to target here because they're all so fast.
[142:50.24]I think I can do this.
[142:53.96]I believe those guys do spawn enemies though, so they have to...
[142:59.64]die sooner or later.
[143:00.58]That was a challenge.
[143:10.19]That was a scary thought.
[143:11.07]Oh, I got the cannonball.
[143:12.43]Whatever that was.
[143:13.65]Oh, you already had that.
[143:14.51]That's why you... We're getting it done.
[143:29.02]Two more.
[143:30.49]I haven't even gotten hit yet.
[143:33.55]Still, you better kill those two people.
[143:36.53]You better get that one kill.
[143:37.73]Hey!
[143:43.78]I'm gonna kill the one over here on the left.
[143:53.52]There's so many guys.
[143:54.47]Yeah, there's like an unnecessary amount of them.
[144:05.90]Because these things fucking just keep spawning.
[144:08.98]They're so hard to kill when there's this many dudes!
[144:15.69]It's hard to even tell what's even happening on the screen because there's so many people.
[144:18.39]I almost have a, uh... I almost have a dummy.
[144:26.76]I'm going to die.
[144:32.26]Come on, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy.
[144:33.38]I'm gonna throw them in this corner over here on the left, so get out of there.
[144:38.34]Kill the things.
[144:40.78]Jeez, did that really just... No, boy.
[144:42.96]Fucking more shieldings.
[144:48.56]Oh, he got the ogre.
[144:56.92]Any time you want to assassinate these shield guys...
[144:59.86]Uh, I'm trying to find opportunities.
[145:04.87]Opportunities now.
[145:05.99]You just gotta take it, my friend.
[145:07.87]Well, it's got like a 12 second cooldown or something.
[145:14.63]Oh my god.
[145:15.19]Really?!
[145:16.45]Really?!
[145:16.88]Yeah, that's, that's, that is horseshit.
[145:22.68]Maybe this game's designed for like fucking four people.
[145:27.36]Decoy in the middle.
[145:28.56]Error, network desync.
[145:30.46]There's that again.
[145:31.28]Really?
[145:31.74]Oh no.
[145:35.24]That's just distracting enough.
[145:47.66]Oh no.
[145:48.69]Dead.
[145:48.85]More coming.
[145:49.93]I died.
[145:55.13]Oh boy.
[145:56.51]Well, I gotta kill ten of these, man.
[146:03.71]And they all charge at once.
[146:12.15]No, I gotta get rid of that thing before I do anything else.
[146:14.19]At least I can go invisible.
[146:17.42]You missed it.
[146:18.64]I know, I'm just so scared to even attempt it.
[146:21.74]Actually, hold on, here we go.
[146:24.88]What?
[146:25.08]Go, go hit the dummy, you fucking... He's dead.
[146:29.28]Okay.
[146:29.46]Yes.
[146:31.48]How many things need to die?
[146:32.48]Nine?
[146:32.92]Ten.
[146:34.08]That did not count.
[146:35.90]The hardest thing to kill did not count.
[146:38.26]Oh, that's dumb.
[146:39.88]I wish I had something to throw.
[146:44.43]If it's at all possible to keep the... Can you keep, like, the troll away?
[146:49.53]Like, in, like, the corner or something?
[146:50.97]If I hang out for one second?
[146:52.35]He's on fire.
[146:55.96]He's actually going to die.
[146:56.92]That's good.
[146:57.28]I'll just kite him around.
[146:59.20]What was lighting him on fire?
[147:00.75]My little demon.
[147:04.05]There we go.
[147:04.47]Got him.
[147:05.29]Okay, now this should be a lot easier.
[147:10.83]That is really cool.
[147:11.59]You can just do that.
[147:12.27]Okay.
[147:27.35]See ya.
[147:27.79]Man, your run speed is, like, keeping you alive, too.
[147:34.36]Yeah, it really is.
[147:34.96]It's great.
[147:42.70]Take one bad hit from this, though, and... That was risky.
[147:48.42]Between Collect Four Souls and my network desync message, I feel like I'm on a really low field of view.
[147:59.23]three more guys there's like most of them have no health ow he threw a fucking knife two more guys there we go back to me okay well that was that was horrible
[148:22.97]That was hard.
[148:24.55]Can we go back and do the Iron Maiden?
[148:26.81]Because if that's going to give us a bunch of items, I almost walked in that hole.
[148:30.15]Don't do it.
[148:33.33]I'd have ended the stream there.
[148:35.68]That's probably what would have happened.
[148:38.58]We both just went in.
[148:40.44]That's the jump thing.
[148:42.94]Be careful with that, though.
[148:45.72]Wasn't there something else back here?
[148:46.78]Like healing or something?
[148:49.03]That we can take?
[148:49.55]I don't know.
[148:53.61]Something called the Iron Maiden.
[148:54.85]I feel like this is a gauntlet and it's not gonna be good.
[148:57.50]You go next.
[148:58.18]I can't like see messages.
[149:01.44]Is it usable?
[149:02.36]Do we hit it?
[149:02.84]I don't know.
[149:04.44]I'm really scared.
[149:09.22]Okay, yeah.
[149:10.01]It's a big guy.
[149:10.71]Big guy.
[149:11.81]Okay, well whatever this sword does, it's really good.
[149:21.89]Okay, I'm gonna play really passive.
[149:30.22]He's a one-hit kill.
[149:32.02]Do not get touched by that guy.
[149:33.65]Okay, we'll hit someone.
[149:38.87]Oh, we could probably cheese this.
[149:42.03]Nope.
[149:43.23]Oh my god.
[149:44.43]I really want this message off my fucking screen.
[149:46.73]It wasn't bothering me at first.
[149:49.01]He's actually, actually, now that I look at it, he's kind of an idiot.
[149:52.76]Yeah.
[149:53.87]I just got caught up in the other ogre.
[149:56.04]But if he hits you, it instantly killed me.
[150:05.98]I just don't want to go near him.
[150:07.06]I'm just going to fireball him forever.
[150:09.24]Yeah, definitely do that.
[150:10.32]Because if he does touch you, you're going to die.
[150:18.88]He's running.
[150:21.98]That's why I was trying to warn you.
[150:24.59]I was pressing the wrong button to roll.
[150:26.81]When he makes like the rooooo- when he starts to run.
[150:36.81]That scared me.
[150:41.81]This is barely hurting him.
[150:42.81]Well, it's doing enough. How much damage is it doing? 10?
[150:48.31]11 and then like it ticks for like Probably total it's doing like 12.
[150:52.38]Well, he ends up getting stunned like he like stops and goes a girl Ineffective think wait till he can you run him into the wall?
[151:02.08]Yeah, you can I Thought you were gonna get by that swipe
[151:13.83]I'm not taking any risks.
[151:15.17]Yeah, just don't get cocky with this one.
[151:18.43]Alright, I'm just gonna get out of your way, because I don't want to have any distractions for you.
[151:29.10]How am I missing him?
[151:38.06]Woo!
[151:38.92]Oh god.
[151:39.56]Well, that's one soul for you.
[151:44.69]Well.
[151:46.59]Okay, what did this do?
[151:47.65]What's the mysterious potion?
[151:49.63]Plus 13 damage for every active curse or disease.
[151:56.34]And I have the network desync curse.
[152:02.88]That's actually crazy.
[152:04.53]Yeah, that is actually insane.
[152:06.85]So you want a bunch of curses.
[152:10.21]Take the potion.
[152:10.99]Take the mysterious potion.
[152:11.69]It'll probably give you one.
[152:16.48]Nope, just cured you of everything.
[152:17.86]No, the curse is still there.
[152:20.28]Curing only gets rid of diseases.
[152:25.53]There's a stone here.
[152:29.83]We're in a bad situation.
[152:34.15]We haven't been in a good situation this whole run.
[152:36.91]Wasn't there more shit we could buy?
[152:38.43]Is this the freeze boots?
[152:41.76]Yeah, I don't want that.
[152:48.41]I think we're pretty close to the end of this level.
[152:51.37]Yeah, this is that horrible room.
[152:52.75]I really hate not being able to see, like, that part of my screen.
[152:55.41]Uh, there's... monsters in here.
[152:59.11]Quite a few of them.
[153:15.11]Two more.
[153:18.69]One more.
[153:22.35]I actually think I want to go back and get that, uh, freeze blade.
[153:27.31]Yeah, I do.
[153:27.79]Frostmourne?
[153:29.09]Yeah.
[153:29.61]It has good range on it.
[153:32.40]Actually, I'm just gonna wait for you.
[153:33.24]We don't have to both go.
[153:35.42]Foul down the hole.
[153:37.40]Just kidding.
[153:38.46]There's a noise it makes.
[153:39.38]I just wanted to make you go.
[153:41.98]Yeah, you have to kill a certain amount of people before he gets revived.
[153:47.22]We did.
[153:49.05]I'm just hanging out now, man.
[153:52.99]Just hanging out.
[153:55.17]I'm coming.
[153:58.96]Just hanging out, man.
[154:00.30]What does this sword look like?
[154:01.16]Isn't there like a Skyrim obsidian sword that looks like this, actually?
[154:04.48]Everything in a game is a reference to another game nowadays.
[154:09.77]You can't have a game that doesn't have references to other games.
[154:13.19]I'm going back.
[154:24.15]This is the end of the level.
[154:28.22]Oh, there you go.
[154:31.92]Look at the kills and damage dealt.
[154:33.38]I was dead for a lot of that.
[154:35.34]Yeah, I know you were.
[154:37.26]That's what I'm pointing out.
[154:41.60]Don't... This is a boss, without a doubt.
[154:44.30]I would hope it would be the same boss so we'd know what to do.
[154:50.00]No.
[154:51.55]No, of course not.
[154:52.53]Okay, well... Of course not.
[154:53.49]So, just scope it out.
[154:55.71]Scope it out.
[154:56.67]I'm gonna take my levitation wings.
[155:01.19]Because, you know... There's a pit, you know, just in case.
[155:03.73]You know, just in case, you know, something happens there.
[155:06.63]Okay, you ready?
[155:09.01]I guess.
[155:13.20]That looks scary.
[155:14.38]It's like a beholder.
[155:17.36]Learn his moves.
[155:18.84]Play it safe for a minute here.
[155:22.59]He throws thumbs.
[155:26.22]I don't know what they do.
[155:26.96]I'm scared to go up to them.
[155:30.68]I don't know.
[155:31.04]I killed one already.
[155:33.66]They look like they're asleep right now.
[155:36.14]Yeah, he might wake them up or something.
[155:40.51]Woo!
[155:41.61]Woo!
[155:43.19]Ah!
[155:43.85]Kill the thumbs.
[155:44.79]Kill the thumbs.
[155:46.91]I'm almost dead, man.
[155:50.49]Kill the thumbs.
[155:51.31]For sure.
[155:52.97]I'm dead.
[155:55.59]You're also going to die, by the way.
[155:58.76]By the way?
[155:59.54]I don't know if you know this, but you're dead.
[156:03.16]What?
[156:03.36]I didn't think he was going to jump over here.
[156:07.24]Alright, no, no, no.
[156:07.76]This is what's going to happen here.
[156:08.71]You ready?
[156:08.93]You want to know what's going to happen here?
[156:09.87]What's going to happen?
[156:10.35]He's going to do the thumbs.
[156:11.67]He's going to do the thumbs, and I'm just going to kill the thumbs and not even attack him and get you back.
[156:18.13]If you can avoid him long enough too, my little demon keeps firing at him.
[156:21.73]And he seems to take a lot of damage from fire.
[156:25.87]So I'm trying to like body block him as much as I can.
[156:28.28]I know, he just got on me.
[156:32.02]There's nowhere I could go.
[156:33.14]Adam's stuck for a second.
[156:42.70]Thumbs, come on.
[156:46.16]Dude, he's almost dead.
[156:50.41]Just don't die and I'll be able to kill him with my fireballs.
[156:57.44]That's... Holy shit, how am I... Oh my god!
[157:06.91]He's gonna die, dude.
[157:09.47]You have to hit him one time.
[157:13.47]What?
[157:14.35]No!
[157:14.53]No!
[157:14.83]Oh my god, I gotta kill things.
[157:17.50]I gotta kill things so you can come back.
[157:19.64]They all jumped in the hole!
[157:21.22]What the fuck just happened?
[157:22.50]They all jumped- Is he reviving himself?
[157:25.00]Oh my- There's a health- Oh, health over here.
[157:27.30]Health over here.
[157:29.14]You gotta be shitting me.
[157:30.30]Why?
[157:31.40]Okay, so you gotta kill all the little dickheads that come out.
[157:34.72]Oh, man.
[157:37.33]Not cool.
[157:42.99]It couldn't be that easy, could it?
[157:44.75]Why is it so close?
[157:46.55]The camera's so close to me.
[157:51.52]He is up my ass right now.
[157:54.78]How many more things need to die?
[157:56.63]Seven.
[157:58.09]Those things don't count?
[157:58.87]I think they did.
[158:04.51]No, they don't.
[158:10.39]We've learned his patterns.
[158:12.19]He just needs to go.
[158:14.67]Oh my god.
[158:15.35]He's going to shoot me with these stupid ice bolts.
[158:18.58]I'm dead.
[158:21.87]Was there even... There was not much time for you to even kill the things that respawned him.
[158:26.63]They just all jumped in the hole.
[158:28.51]Okay, here's what I think was happening there.
[158:32.25]Those things are all him, and that's his health.
[158:35.35]And you have to kill every single one of those.
[158:38.63]Well, I wish I knew that, because if I had killed even six or seven of them, you would be able to come back.
[158:45.62]That's too bad.
[158:46.16]Well, at least we know what he does and who he is.
[158:48.23]Eh, that's a shame.
[158:51.13]I just want to unlock a class.
[158:53.65]Right when I got the last hit, I put the controller down.
[158:56.67]I was like, we did it.
[158:59.77]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[159:01.55]Let me look at this one more time.
[159:11.43]I don't like that.
[159:15.12]Man.
[159:20.23]Apparently we've been playing, or I've been streaming, for 2 hours and 40 minutes.
[159:25.55]This game's fun, man.
[159:26.43]Yeah.
[159:27.47]It's addicting.
[159:27.94]I like it.
[159:29.32]It's addicting.
[159:30.74]There's just enough stuff that you wanna unlock.
[159:32.46]I just wanna, like, beat the game.
[159:37.06]Yeah.
[159:37.56]Beat it once, but... Let's go!
[159:41.04]You spend, like, 20 minutes changing hats every time.
[159:56.00]What did that even do?
[159:56.72]It made me a donkey.
[159:58.98]Oh, it was fully watered.
[160:04.40]No.
[160:12.13]Oh, you can give the Spirit of the Forest five gold.
[160:19.57]What does it do?
[160:21.55]Don't have five gold.
[160:25.37]Should you go see what it does?
[160:30.43]Yeah, let me get the gold.
[160:34.89]Dude, okay, my character has 120% movement speed, and that guy was all over me.
[160:41.64]That's why I fucking died!
[160:42.78]I couldn't get a- he started doing the whirlwind, and it was like, okay, I'm in you.
[160:47.20]I don't know, and even the levitation, trying to get away from him still was just like...
[161:04.06]Man, I'm quite miffed.
[161:07.64]You tried so hard.
[161:10.34]Got so far.
[161:12.30]That boss is much different.
[161:13.94]The first boss we played, you kind of can just sit to the left and figure it out.
[161:18.89]we like killed him and it still was that was not the right encounter we did it wrong let's go back to the tree yeah you know I don't do this but can I do a full gameplay of this on youtube you're watching it just righteous strike
[161:46.68]What does that mean?
[161:47.78]You're watching it right now.
[161:49.59]Critical chance plus 50.
[161:52.21]He gives you a random blessing for either six rooms.
[161:55.81]What do you get?
[161:57.25]Nothing, because you gave him the gold.
[161:59.81]Yeah, I have plus 50% crit for six rooms.
[162:05.97]Kind of cool.
[162:09.81]One of these rooms, your favorite.
[162:11.43]I'm going to take a million damage in here.
[162:27.30]Go, go, go.
[162:34.48]I guess we get back to where we are kind of fast now.
[162:43.54]Yeah.
[162:45.36]We've learned the ways of the land.
[162:46.78]I have to pee so badly.
[162:52.02]I don't know how you feel about this.
[162:55.10]I really don't care.
[162:59.67]Bring them down here so we can kick them off.
[163:13.02]Okay, now apparently this is the room where I'm gonna take all the damage.
[163:16.08]That's what I'm telling you, come down here.
[163:17.42]We can just kick them off.
[163:20.22]Just gotta get close enough to kick them.
[163:22.88]That almost knocked you off with it.
[163:24.76]Yeah, it almost did.
[163:36.38]Hamburglar.
[163:37.62]That's a max?
[163:39.26]Oh no, that's permanently raised by 10 HP.
[163:41.98]You take the Hamburglar and all the gold, because you like that.
[163:44.29]And I'll take... You take the health guy.
[163:46.83]And I'll take this health guy.
[163:54.37]And no one will take the murky water.
[164:05.22]Okay.
[164:06.65]You're just going to keep doing that.
[164:08.95]It doesn't do anything good.
[164:10.51]There's got to be something good it does.
[164:12.23]It has to be, right?
[164:13.82]No.
[164:14.26]It doesn't have to be.
[164:17.24]Well, it's two rooms.
[164:18.16]I'm fine.
[164:19.70]This room's a joke.
[164:24.68]Kind of was.
[164:25.14]Yeah, one room.
[164:26.78]Yeah, this is the last room.
[164:27.86]Yeah, this is a joke.
[164:29.07]We're fine.
[164:30.17]Now would probably be a good time for you to do that.
[164:39.09]Get out of the way.
[164:40.03]I'm gonna throw a bomb in the corner.
[164:43.47]Oh Come on give me that triple You have to do this jumping for six rooms You'll be alright well, I'll get the assassin guy if I do this probably yes, you will get the assassin guy if you do that
[165:10.66]It was probably a lot easier for you because I just did everything.
[165:12.70]No, you didn't.
[165:18.53]You did not just do everything.
[165:22.09]Get out of the fucking way.
[165:24.19]I tried to assassinate that guy and I ended up killing him myself.
[165:44.06]Oh, yeah.
[165:49.37]I can at least carry it.
[165:52.63]Oh, okay.
[165:53.47]Remember this one?
[165:54.97]This is the one where... I just got challenges for coming in here.
[165:58.00]This is different.
[165:58.82]Yeah, I did too.
[166:00.60]This is just potion room.
[166:01.88]Gives blessing, giant strength, you grow bigger and stronger.
[166:04.36]That's good.
[166:09.23]I'm gonna get that one.
[166:11.52]That removes poison and curses one is really good, but you know.
[166:15.58]And got the gold.
[166:17.76]Um, well, I guess I can do this.
[166:19.33]I can carry that.
[166:24.23]I was going to say, draw, drink it, and buy that on.

[171:07.37]I can't tell through your stupid Spartan mask.
[171:09.85]I should let you destroy that.
[171:10.81]Yeah, let me destroy everything that can be destroyed.
[171:15.07]Like Tree Man.
[171:15.91]Please destroy Tree Man.
[171:20.47]I'd love to.
[171:24.47]I would love nothing more than to destroy Tree Man, but Tree Man's kind of annoying.
[171:34.28]I don't think he's fighting you.
[171:37.80]Step on that guy's head.
[171:39.02]I know, I... Watch out, tree man's coming.
[171:51.21]Wish these guys could be knocked down.
[172:03.47]I'm sure he had, like, different weapons.
[172:05.39]I'm going back to grab a potion real quick.
[172:09.35]Yep.
[172:11.91]Hmm, anything else to destroy?
[172:13.29]What time is it?
[172:16.21]1?
[172:16.23]1.30?
[172:16.98]That's the latest I've stayed up in, like, three weeks.
[172:20.62]Well, we can make this the last one.
[172:22.74]Yeah.
[172:25.14]I've been a good sleepy boy.
[172:27.32]Watch out.
[172:27.68]This is bad.
[172:28.48]Really bad.
[172:29.74]We have to clear these before this guy.
[172:31.04]Maybe he's an idiot and he'll jump to his death.
[172:37.01]Alright, we need a game plan here.
[172:38.89]Okay, good.
[172:43.48]Shit.
[172:45.22]Wow.
[172:46.18]Wow, you psycho, but it worked.
[172:49.52]Fucking dummy!
[172:50.40]I was clearly going for the maneuver.
[173:04.80]You took the risk once, and you took it again.
[173:07.52]Just get out of here.
[173:08.22]Run.
[173:09.92]Running forever.
[173:16.50]You took the risk twice.
[173:17.94]That was your mistake.
[173:20.68]I will be running for the next 300 rooms.
[173:26.94]I don't know if I can... Kent, please.
[173:29.04]Oh, dear.
[173:30.50]You're going to have to get into spikes again.
[173:38.72]Just revive me.
[173:39.26]I need four Mosuls.
[173:40.60]Revive me.
[173:43.20]These enemies are chumps.
[173:45.26]I'll take care of the two idiots that are walking over here.
[173:58.03]Two more and I'm back.
[174:00.73]Oh, he's back, baby.
[174:02.43]And we can go get the chest.
[174:03.87]Live from New York.
[174:08.44]This time do not... I can't believe I even tried for that chest.
[174:11.51]Please do not soccer kick me into the abyss again.
[174:16.57]Dude, what are you doing?!
[174:18.77]That was the most unnecessary, like, double jump damage ever.
[174:23.55]Like, you're the fucking ninja in every movie that has to, like, show off.
[174:31.50]What is this?
[174:33.98]Ass potion, yeah, no thanks.
[174:39.50]Let's go, man.
[174:42.02]If you were to fall off with your double jump.
[174:45.71]Uh, the ninja that has to show off in every movie.
[174:49.75]Yeah, he like flips and does cartwheels and shit and shows off his kung fu.
[174:54.53]Well, that's spell damage.
[174:56.67]Watch out.
[174:58.16]That's the arcane missiles or whatever.
[175:01.50]You take it, because I'm like fucking running.
[175:05.40]You still have run, man?
[175:07.20]For four more rooms.
[175:08.86]Thanks, Ms.
[175:09.38]Pauling.
[175:09.72]I have 200 plus gold.
[175:13.86]I hope we find, like, a broken ass item that I can put on.
[175:20.45]Is it a shop?
[175:21.39]No.
[175:22.65]But there's a big chest in here.
[175:28.15]I don't wanna be run man!
[175:33.79]Just run over here.
[175:35.30]That's all I can do!
[175:39.30]Oh, come on.
[175:40.08]You don't do that to me.
[175:43.08]I'm almost dead.
[175:45.59]I almost want to die.
[175:46.69]Uh, no, you're being a good distraction.
[175:50.31]Don't die right now.
[175:51.21]Alright, you can do whatever the hell you want now.
[175:55.25]Well, maybe there'll be something inside this chest.
[175:58.13]Dude, please.
[175:59.07]Please.
[175:59.33]I'm working on a big, giant, ugly asshole, and you're, like, walking into me.
[176:07.11]Oh, see, I didn't know you were working on a big, giant, ugly asshole.
[176:09.85]Alright, you do that in case you die, it doesn't matter.
[176:19.98]There's the... teeth thing.
[176:24.76]Yeah, that's probably good for you to get that.
[176:27.16]What's this?
[176:28.52]Spell damage gives random curse.
[176:31.08]Y'all, how many more of those did you need?
[176:32.43]Longsword, I'm taking longsword, fuck this.
[176:35.65]Uh, I just unlocked the pirate, by the way.
[176:38.05]Oh, good job.
[176:39.61]Oh!
[176:39.73]Because I've collected a ton of money.
[176:43.33]Alright.
[176:44.19]Okay, ready?
[176:45.09]No, no, no, no.
[176:45.63]I mean, no.
[176:50.40]What's going on?
[176:51.28]Jared.
[176:53.16]Oh.
[176:53.62]Let's go.
[176:55.74]Good for you.
[176:57.12]I need health.
[176:58.48]Uh, this is great, because we synergize so well now, because I can just heal the shit out of you.
[177:02.06]Oh, yeah!
[177:03.04]Oh, man.
[177:04.00]What a comeback.
[177:04.62]Yeah.
[177:06.17]Come back, kid, over here.
[177:07.09]That's the end of the level.
[177:10.32]Well, make sure you heal up as much as you can.
[177:13.50]So yeah, guys.
[177:16.35]The jaw that I picked up makes you heal instead of get gold, so I can't get gold ever again, but who needs it when Jerma has, like, four million?
[177:23.40]No, I can't spend this money.
[177:25.82]Apparently, I did lose max health.
[177:27.72]Max health is 50 right now.
[177:29.58]You're still picking up the gold anyway.
[177:30.76]That's cool.
[177:32.34]It's exploding on top of me.
[177:34.04]You can't avoid it sometimes.
[177:35.68]Oh, yeah, sure.
[177:38.14]I didn't even come out of the ground.
[177:39.32]I'm going to give you some health avenue here.
[177:56.06]It's weird how hard I'm trying to, like, not break anything.
[178:02.23]Dude, that's so... I can just feed you.
[178:06.45]Aw, yeah, baby.
[178:07.31]I can get it all.
[178:09.23]I'll put it all in.
[178:10.79]Yeah, gold eater and gold maker.
[178:15.02]I'm scared of this one.
[178:15.62]Fuck.
[178:16.24]No.
[178:16.42]No.
[178:33.29]Okay.
[178:33.53]That wasn't that bad.
[178:34.83]I'm max health.
[178:35.37]Just scared me.
[178:40.85]We need to... Okay, card guy.
[178:44.86]Oh, yeah.
[178:45.42]Do you want to do it or do you want me to do it?
[178:47.92]You have all the gold.
[178:48.72]Wait, no, wait, wait, wait.
[178:50.26]I have exactly 13 gold.
[178:52.61]Do it.
[178:52.89]That I'll never be able to use for anything else.
[179:06.02]coins.
[179:08.52]A new weapon.
[179:13.08]Oh, here we go.
[179:23.57]That really is like the best, the best thing in the game to get because who cares?
[179:28.46]It's like seven people.
[179:30.74]It's like a normal room.
[179:34.30]a whole bunch of items unless you like get the devil card first and you suck yeah and you suck what is this weapon I don't know I haven't had a chance to look at it fast and short holy and 17 damage yeah holy crap the thing's fast well this long sword is 13. I'm money guy
[180:04.97]Remember?
[180:05.63]Yeah.
[180:08.00]If this is an achievement for getting, like, 500 gold in one run, I'm going to get it.
[180:11.62]Alright, you ready?
[180:17.78]Don't like this from already.
[180:26.59]Don't stand there.
[180:27.69]Just trying to kick this guy.
[180:32.43]Knock him on the ground in you and just throw him.
[180:36.01]This guy's got a shield.
[180:37.25]It's broken.
[180:38.27]Do jump attacks break shields?
[180:40.83]I guess.
[180:41.21]I think we just figured that out.
[180:42.81]Yeah.
[180:45.01]That's good to know.
[180:45.80]What is he doing?
[180:47.04]Just keep them over there.
[180:47.90]Who knows?
[180:48.56]Oh, those are some of the we-have-to-crush-their-heads kind of guys.
[180:53.80]I only have 60 health.
[180:54.42]I think they treat the broken ground as if it's not even there.
[180:57.44]They, like, don't want to walk on it.
[180:59.84]Yeah.
[181:00.62]I'll die if I go over there.
[181:01.68]I don't have enough health.
[181:07.90]We could just do this.
[181:09.24]We could just do this.
[181:11.20]I'm not against doing this.
[181:12.24]This is our last run.
[181:13.18]Who wants to be a hero?
[181:17.47]When you can just do this.
[181:20.07]I don't know why you're being a hero.
[181:21.73]Because we have to crush these guys' heads.
[181:23.05]That guy flew so far.
[181:34.88]Crush your head.
[181:39.38]Wait, I need some gold again.
[181:40.56]Okay.
[181:46.31]Anything else to break?
[181:47.01]No.
[181:47.07]Another one of these dumb rooms.
[181:54.51]Yeah, it really does.
[181:55.17]That's awesome.
[181:55.59]That's so much easier.
[182:04.08]Money.
[182:05.78]Money?
[182:05.98]No money.
[182:09.22]Shop?
[182:10.67]No, it's just a scary random chest.
[182:13.05]I don't know what's over here.
[182:14.79]As soon as you open this, we're fucked.
[182:16.27]Let's go open this... Oh my god, this jump.
[182:19.29]That's a ju- that's a- I don't... I did it on purpose, don't worry.
[182:25.86]Don't!
[182:26.28]Don't!
[182:28.22]There's no reason to do that.
[182:30.06]No, because I can time it right.
[182:31.04]It's like, I can figure it out easier.
[182:35.52]You ready?
[182:36.44]No, no, no, wait, wait.
[182:37.56]Actually, actually, it probably is better for both of us to be on different spots.
[182:43.97]What did you just do?
[182:44.91]I messed it up and almost threw me off.
[182:48.27]Jesus.
[182:52.09]Oh, is this just a fucked up room?
[182:55.07]I don't know, I guess.
[182:56.23]Here, you take, um... You take that health.
[182:58.86]I'll hit immunity to poison.
[183:04.91]Blocked off its immunity to fire.
[183:06.37]It's either immunity to poison or immunity to fire.
[183:08.53]I'm gonna take poison.
[183:10.46]Okay.
[183:11.14]I'll take fire.
[183:13.20]You don't want this thing?
[183:14.60]That's 50% critical hit chance.
[183:17.88]I like this a lot.
[183:20.56]17 damage fast swings?
[183:22.64]No.
[183:22.94]I don't know, dude.
[183:23.56]I have so much money.
[183:25.12]Is it just to keep you, like... Yeah.
[183:27.26]Okay, let's go.
[183:27.89]Wait, anything up here?
[183:28.81]Do we look up there?
[183:29.57]No, nothing.
[183:34.46]Come on, let's keep it rolling.
[183:35.82]Here's that thing.
[183:39.32]I mean, I might as well.
[183:40.69]You have a lot of money.
[183:42.67]Might as well just do this a bunch of times.
[183:45.17]I can get a whole bunch of healing potions.
[183:58.17]Yeah.
[183:58.53]What is that one?
[184:01.23]You want to take the mystery?
[184:02.33]Or what?
[184:02.87]What was that other one that you picked up?
[184:04.11]I don't even know what that is.
[184:05.23]That's- I had that already.
[184:06.17]It's the giant one.
[184:07.35]Oh.
[184:07.55]I'm waiting for like a boss or something to do that.
[184:11.45]Guess I'll take the mystery one.
[184:15.82]Which is basically murky water, but has a chance to not- Oh, hey!
[184:19.46]Like the chef's room?
[184:21.18]With the bomb guys.
[184:24.06]They're just bombing themselves.
[184:25.81]Yeah, just let them kill each other.
[184:28.63]Well, this is great.
[184:29.37]Don't even attack them.
[184:31.07]Just run them into stuff.
[184:39.49]That was... okay.
[184:40.37]Yeah, they're seriously all just killing each other.
[184:50.00]I mean, I get the theme of the chef guy, and there's something he's cooking down here.
[184:55.50]Why is chef hanging out with all these mad bombers?
[185:00.46]Who knows?
[185:00.86]Because you're a real psycho if you're these guys.
[185:05.22]Bombs...
[185:14.41]As far as how many different rooms we've still been running into, that seem new in the same areas.
[185:19.56]Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[185:25.12]Do we break this thing anymore?
[185:29.56]Cleaver.
[185:29.98]I guess not.
[185:36.85]We good?
[185:37.71]We good?
[185:38.41]I guess we're good.
[185:45.89]We good?
[185:47.75]Hello?
[185:48.21]I just said yeah.
[185:50.97]Did you not ear me?
[185:53.37]It better be.
[186:03.65]I really have to look at the boss now.
[186:04.75]There's the boss.
[186:05.79]Okay, we need to discuss.
[186:07.76]We do need to discuss.
[186:08.94]I have a very short weapon.
[186:09.96]He's very hard to kill.
[186:12.32]Um, don't fall on the thing.
[186:13.44]I have the giant potion.
[186:14.90]Do you actually, you know what?
[186:16.92]You take that.
[186:17.66]That's like the super you're a psychopath damage dealing thing.
[186:20.54]That lasts the whole room?
[186:22.48]I'm gonna assume it does.
[186:23.32]Okay.
[186:25.56]Let's go.
[186:28.66]Oh my god.
[186:30.58]Um, I am a big guy.
[186:33.41]You are a big guy.
[186:34.03]You being able to fly here seemed pretty nice.
[186:36.57]Yep.
[186:37.01]Don't have that luxury anymore.
[186:38.11]Oh my god, you are ripping him to shreds.
[186:45.06]I don't do, like, any damage.
[186:51.04]Oh, he's not even hurting me yet, besides the armor.
[186:58.71]Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
[187:00.21]I think I just ran out of armor.
[187:02.01]Here comes the thing.
[187:03.65]He's dying, he's dying, he's dying.
[187:04.69]Get ready, get ready.
[187:05.23]All the things.
[187:09.48]Wow, that's so much easier knowing, like, what's happening.
[187:13.04]Yeah.
[187:15.05]heal up burger oh yeah look at yeah yeah yeah once you know don't get pushed in yeah once you understand like what's and plus you have like super I'm a huge guy thing it's only a couple more left
[187:45.70]Oh, that's that.
[187:48.55]Did we win?
[187:50.37]Oh, there's one guy here.
[187:52.99]That was so much easier.
[187:56.11]He's not dead.
[187:58.81]Is he?
[187:59.56]I think he's dead.
[188:02.18]Ooh, this is... We've never seen this before, have we?
[188:04.26]Yeah, the other guy didn't do that.
[188:05.84]He dropped just a regular chest, I think.
[188:08.00]Open it.
[188:14.18]book of spells come over here the sword only hits with critical hit 99 damage I don't think that's even worth it though what's my crit chance oh my read these iron boots too
[188:46.08]Jesus You can pick up the boots.
[188:49.52]These socks are the avoid traps.
[188:51.22]So we're both like trap immune Okay, but what about the sword?
[188:56.42]Dude, that sword is... You can press um Does it show you your crit chance?
[189:02.74]Yeah, crit chance for me is 15% I'm at 5% Yeah, I'm at 15.
[189:07.65]It's not worth it.
[189:08.87]I should still just be money guy.
[189:10.19]I mean that's been working, right?
[189:11.59]Yeah
[189:16.48]There's no way that's going to work with 15.
[189:18.38]15%?
[189:18.40]Dude, you could probably instantly kill bosses.
[189:27.52]Let me see, what are you currently using right now?
[189:29.67]It's 17 and it's a fast swing.
[189:31.31]That's all it is, 17 fast swing.
[189:35.01]Is there items to get your crit up or anything?
[189:36.99]Yeah, there is.
[189:38.27]Man.
[189:38.61]I mean, mine is 15.
[189:42.59]I have a 15% chance to probably... Well, even then...
[189:47.46]I don't know, man.
[189:48.00]How many times do you actually swing and hit somebody to kill them?
[189:50.46]It's probably more than ten times.
[189:52.52]Or like eight times, right?
[189:53.60]I just- I'm worried I'm gonna be useful- Everyone's screaming, do it, let's go.
[189:59.82]When the whole chat is screaming, do it.
[190:03.14]It's just- this is just like, we've beaten a boss before, but this is about as far as we've gotten, and I really would like to beat this.
[190:10.51]Try not to pick those up, leave them for health.
[190:16.21]Okay.
[190:18.13]We're moving to traps.
[190:19.97]Yeah, step on the traps.
[190:21.93]Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero... 200.
[190:27.02]What the fuck is... I don't know.
[190:29.10]What's happening right now?
[190:30.80]I'm like stun-locked.
[190:31.62]Is it that guy?
[190:34.23]He was just doing a bunch of ice.
[190:47.16]This is so awkward.
[190:49.80]Zero, zero, zero.
[190:50.88]I have to go heal.
[190:52.24]Those guys are... Oh, there's all that health.
[190:53.96]Yeah.
[190:56.55]Destroy the paintings.
[191:03.55]I'm just, like, feeding you.
[191:04.67]That's so stupid.
[191:05.37]I love it.
[191:05.73]I'm still big for another five rooms.
[191:08.89]But it doesn't matter because I can't hit anything.
[191:12.03]Oh my god, let's do it.
[191:18.94]Guardian Angel's out.
[191:19.66]I would have you get that, for sure.
[191:26.45]I picked up the other weapon.
[191:27.55]I apologize to everyone, but... Jeez, watch out.
[191:45.40]If I had more crit chance than 15... We gotta focus these spellcasters.
[191:53.20]They're really, really horrible.
[191:57.48]Whoa, who the hell is that?
[192:00.64]Fucking Skeletor?
[192:02.31]Yeah.
[192:07.17]Where am I?
[192:08.63]Up top.
[192:09.05]You're the biggest guy here.
[192:10.43]I know, I was like on the ground for so long I couldn't find myself.
[192:15.09]This is a bad room.
[192:17.38]These are always bad rooms.
[192:24.18]That guy doesn't have a shield anymore.
[192:25.30]At least you have the resurrect thing, if need be.
[192:41.15]Yeah.
[192:46.04]Random curse and spell damage.
[192:47.49]I feel like I should take... You know, here's what I'm going to do.
[192:49.71]I'm going to take the curse with the spell damage, and then I can rely on fireball for damage and use the crit sword.
[192:58.09]You feel?
[192:59.61]I do feel.
[193:04.27]I don't know what the bigger curse is.
[193:06.39]I think it took away all my gold or something.
[193:08.20]That seems like it matters.
[193:10.34]Well, I'm sure we'll find that out.
[193:15.44]Oh boy.
[193:15.94]I feel like it's better if only one of us is down there.
[193:22.45]We're going to be knocking each other into the hole.
[193:25.71]These enemies are getting much more difficult.
[193:44.34]How do you actually perform the kick?
[193:46.82]Because my kicks still do normal damage.
[193:48.04]You have to be very, very close.
[193:50.00]And it's just a regular attack.
[193:51.12]Oh, okay.
[193:51.64]That makes it a lot easier.
[193:54.54]Please tell me.
[193:55.16]Please tell me this is a shop.
[193:57.34]Because I have so much money.
[193:58.82]It'd be a shame if it wasn't.
[194:02.60]It's not.
[194:03.44]It's not.
[194:04.38]It's not at all.
[194:21.92]Big guy dead.
[194:24.56]I've shrunk to like normal size.
[194:27.98]I'm not like quite all the way shrunken.
[194:34.84]I mean my criticals hit for like 200, but otherwise I don't hit.
[194:43.68]200's a pretty huge number.
[194:45.44]I can't heal.
[194:47.22]The curse isn't letting me do it.
[194:49.15]Yeah.
[194:50.39]It's just dropping rocks?
[194:52.03]Yeah.
[194:53.79]Don't be a rock guy.
[194:55.95]Yeah, I guess.
[194:56.49]We can get, like, infinite rocks.
[194:58.89]Destroy that painting.
[195:00.67]Oh, don't be... Easy, easy when you come in here.
[195:02.61]Easy, very easy.
[195:05.80]No, this is not easy.
[195:08.22]Remember those circular men?
[195:10.26]They explode.
[195:15.02]The circular men.
[195:16.12]I wanna assassinate somebody, but... Is there any indication of when they will?
[195:32.53]When they die.
[195:33.89]Oh, okay.
[195:50.67]Really spawning more of these motherfuckers.
[195:54.39]Okay, these people are on fire.
[195:55.39]They're going to blow up that thing.
[195:57.01]Careful.
[195:57.61]Here comes a... This guy's going to explode.
[196:00.08]That guy.
[196:05.54]Yikes.
[196:06.46]Oh, he hurt everyone else.
[196:07.52]That's good.
[196:15.61]Oh yeah, I still have the angel as well.
[196:17.43]That's a good thing.
[196:21.09]Alright, you wanna be a rock guy?
[196:25.71]Yeah.
[196:28.59]Come over here.
[196:30.35]I'm gonna have so many rocks.
[196:34.35]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[196:35.99]What?
[196:36.47]That was an explosive.
[196:37.23]You just took 30 points of damage.
[196:38.21]You didn't even notice?
[196:38.75]That was an explosive barrel?
[196:41.28]Yeah, behind that one was an explosive barrel.
[196:43.68]Oh.
[196:45.10]We're okay.
[196:45.48]I guess.
[196:50.08]Thank God there's nothing in this room.
[196:51.44]Thank God there is nothing in this room.
[196:57.30]Thank God.
[197:00.37]Thank God it's not a shop.
[197:02.99]Thank God there's nothing in this room.
[197:05.67]Let's go.
[197:09.47]I thought that was a joke for a second there.
[197:11.31]Like, wait, did he just find something awesome and not want to tell me?
[197:14.88]How many rocks do you have?
[197:16.94]30 currently.
[197:23.76]It's one of these shrines.
[197:26.87]This is a curse?
[197:31.97]So, now that I have, like, way too much money and you can't be healed anymore, I think it's time I get another weapon.
[197:40.59]Um, what is this?
[197:41.15]I don't know.
[197:47.14]Um, I'm gonna do it.
[197:49.30]Ready?
[197:50.42]Mm-hmm.
[197:51.74]Oh, I don't have enough money.
[197:55.31]Levitation.
[197:56.67]That was really helpful.
[197:58.29]Cool.
[198:03.27]Bombers.
[198:06.46]Dude, I'm such a fucking stupid little useless shit.
[198:10.18]Get on this other side of the room.
[198:12.02]I have axes.
[198:14.72]Okay, I have rocks.
[198:18.63]Oh, this guy's not dead.
[198:19.33]What the hell?
[198:21.51]Oh boy, that's not cool.
[198:30.30]oh I'm dead I'm gonna go you're not though you're fine does that mean I lose my curse wow whoa whoa they kill each other that guy is where do you see how many enemies are being spawned right now no that was insane these guys with the eyeballs can kill everybody they do like the big uh gluttony yeah
[198:59.58]I really need, like, some crit chance.
[199:05.44]Shop?
[199:05.76]I hope so.
[199:12.37]Expensive shop?
[199:14.27]No, it's not expensive.
[199:16.47]Well, you can still get everything.
[199:17.69]Got an achievement for you buying everything.
[199:32.94]I still have more money than I know what to do with.
[199:34.22]I'm running all into rocks, dude.
[199:39.36]Rocks are pretty good.
[199:43.43]I can't even... These things just shoot in random directions.
[199:46.37]How much money do you have?
[199:47.15]388.
[199:48.39]Are you ready?
[199:49.05]I hope we find something that costs 400 and you can't afford it.
[199:58.75]Oh, let me assassinate that guy.
[200:00.27]Nice.
[200:09.69]I really should not have taken this sword, by the way.
[200:11.50]You're gonna be alright.
[200:17.22]He hit us both.
[200:19.30]Yeah, he did.
[200:23.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:25.06]Don't touch him, don't touch him, don't touch him.
[200:27.04]Don't touch him.
[200:27.92]I need the money.
[200:31.50]I'm still cursed?
[200:32.50]That said, it removed curses.
[200:35.64]How cursed am I?
[200:39.15]Bear of the curse.
[200:40.45]Doesn't do anything.
[200:42.37]Drink that murky water.
[200:43.37]You'll feel better.
[200:47.47]I feel like we're getting closer to the boss man.
[200:50.13]Yeah, it's time for me to get a new weapon.
[200:54.68]This weapon is very weak in comparison.
[200:57.10]It's time for me to get a new weapon.
[200:58.62]I need one more than you do.
[201:01.67]Yeah, we both need weapons pretty desperately at this point.
[201:04.85]Because our synergy doesn't work anymore.
[201:07.05]And I don't do damage.
[201:08.54]You don't pick them up anymore.
[201:09.56]I need more rocks.
[201:11.14]You always need more rocks.
[201:13.18]Watch out, there's like a weird Count Dracula enemy that we haven't seen yet.
[201:25.61]I thought you were an enemy.
[201:27.05]You kind of look like them.
[201:27.79]I kind of do.
[201:33.62]Oh, they turned into bats.
[201:38.34]I think it's the one curse that, like, fucks up gold.
[201:42.76]That can't be removed.
[201:47.57]Shit.
[201:53.07]Another shop.
[201:53.75]Come on, another shop.
[201:56.45]A shop.
[201:57.30]Another curse remover.
[201:58.56]Does it matter for you at all?
[202:00.96]No, that's poison and diseases.
[202:02.75]Whatever, I'll carry it.
[202:05.29]I swear the other one was curses.
[202:07.49]Shit.
[202:08.09]This is not good.
[202:09.03]Actually, no, it's okay.
[202:09.73]We can walk over things.
[202:10.69]I'm dead.
[202:16.64]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[202:25.78]Fucking hit him.
[202:31.58]Um, here's to hoping there's a different weapon in there.
[202:35.93]Yeah.
[202:38.07]I would agree.
[202:46.33]That guy wasn't dead.
[202:47.91]That's dumb.
[202:56.80]Okay, let's see what's in here.
[203:01.48]Yeah, a different weapon.
[203:04.70]That is really good.
[203:08.78]That is a really good weapon I wish I could pick up.
[203:11.09]Killing enemy steals health.
[203:12.27]Jeez.
[203:15.73]Duplicates a random item near you.
[203:17.37]Can we get two of these swords?
[203:22.27]If you get all the other shit off the ground.
[203:23.85]Dude, there's this Bomberman and the Bomb Immunity Armor and
[203:32.34]What else is on the ground over here?
[203:33.78]Serious Bomberman?
[203:43.24]You look like a Ninja Turtle.
[203:44.82]Is there anything else over here?
[203:46.66]No, it's just the axe.
[203:48.12]Or are we going to get two of these, right?
[203:49.80]Yeah.
[203:52.50]Oh, wow.
[203:54.25]Wowie.
[203:55.59]Wow-wow-wee-woo.
[203:56.93]Alright.
[203:59.83]So you just need to kill six dudes.
[204:02.27]Okay.
[204:04.73]Kill six dudes.
[204:08.59]Also, how many bombs do you have?
[204:10.71]Three.
[204:10.89]I'm gonna be using them right now.
[204:18.02]Remember, you're immune to the explosions.
[204:20.98]You have, like, double immunity.
[204:24.32]I do.
[204:24.72]Don't die.
[204:27.44]Holy shit.
[204:29.01]This is, like, the worst room we've seen.
[204:31.15]Yeah, it is.
[204:34.15]Need three to die, but these are the three hardest enemies ever.
[204:41.65]Wow, that's a lot of hurts.
[204:42.77]I'm frozen.
[204:47.96]Come back to me.
[204:51.16]Frozen again.
[204:52.18]Watch out, you can't hit those guys.
[204:53.78]You will freeze.
[204:55.04]This is bad.
[204:55.96]Actually, no, it's good for me.
[204:57.24]What are these?
[204:58.56]Exploders.
[205:00.23]Bomb people.
[205:03.89]Where are these teleporting losers?
[205:05.59]They teleport.
[205:06.67]They dash on top of you.
[205:09.11]Yeah!
[205:09.87]That's how I describe them.
[205:15.75]I can't believe I'm still cursed.
[205:18.51]This heal thing is incredible, by the way.
[205:22.89]Every time I kill somebody, I get three health.
[205:27.09]Sounds pretty good.
[205:32.35]I'm dead.
[205:34.63]How many need to die?
[205:36.57]Ten.
[205:38.13]I can't believe I just did that.
[205:40.76]I just rolled over like whatever bombs were happening.
[205:43.96]Well, I don't know dude, I'm kind of like indestructible at the moment, so.
[205:47.84]I want to also be indestructible.
[205:51.28]Kind of.
[205:52.06]What's that mean, anything scary?
[205:53.94]Oh, I can, I'm immune to those.
[205:55.44]Yeah, you should be able to kill eight pretty easy.
[206:11.27]I just want to stock up on whatever is in here.
[206:25.26]Oh, there we go.
[206:25.86]Exactly what I was looking for.
[206:27.16]Another potion.
[206:29.04]Well, remember it's in there.
[206:35.77]Oh god.
[206:36.67]Oh god!
[206:37.55]Yeah, this is real bad.
[206:39.86]This is really, really bad.
[206:41.08]Can I leave?
[206:42.20]Nope.
[206:42.82]Did you have a levitate or something?
[206:45.09]Nope.
[206:45.87]Not on this guy.
[206:46.33]I thought it was a potion before.
[206:51.97]Oh, I sure would love to be able to help.
[206:54.41]But I'm an idiot and kept dying.
[206:57.54]Boy.
[207:03.18]This is... That's unavoidable damage.
[207:05.60]I can't go anywhere.
[207:06.56]You can maybe run to the other side if you run across real fast and don't get hit by anything or frozen at all.
[207:11.87]But I wouldn't risk it.
[207:17.13]How many more?
[207:18.65]Two.
[207:19.49]I got them all.
[207:22.09]This is the hardest enemy here.
[207:23.14]Is it just one more?
[207:30.26]Yeah, there's a shitty other side I can kill.
[207:31.80]Whoa!
[207:32.12]Oh my god!
[207:33.97]I'm revived, I'm revived.
[207:35.35]Thank God, dude, because I- yeah, I'm dead.
[207:37.85]Death is coming across the whole map.
[207:40.83]Oh boy, that was bad.
[207:41.67]I don't want to run across, but I have to.
[207:44.48]I can't kill anything with this weapon.
[207:47.68]It all comes down to this, baby!
[207:54.56]What if I shot you in the ear when you were doing that?
[207:58.36]Yeah, you gotta get this item.
[208:00.16]It's too good.
[208:00.72]And you gotta get the health too.
[208:03.36]It wasn't up here.
[208:03.98]It was a little ways back.
[208:08.46]Oh yeah, I do have a double jump.
[208:09.66]I forgot.
[208:10.17]Yeah, I get that thing.
[208:15.49]That thing is disgusting.
[208:19.89]Wasn't this also the run we decided I was going to be health guy?
[208:22.59]I only have 50 health.
[208:25.13]I think we did decide that at some point, but plans change.
[208:27.81]Okay.
[208:34.05]Good luck.
[208:37.49]Watch out for the chicken.
[208:38.85]Push the chicken in.
[208:40.75]See ya.
[208:43.17]That's it.
[208:43.47]That was the only enemy in here.
[208:49.34]I'm going to stay out of... How do you get over here?
[208:53.14]What?
[208:54.52]Over here.
[208:55.41]You gotta go down and then over, I guess?
[208:58.67]Wow, I am so glad I had double jump.
[209:19.96]Still need nine.
[209:27.46]Watch out bombs, bombs.
[209:29.72]They're alive again.
[209:44.20]Oh, you're alive?
[209:45.44]Nope, I need seven.
[210:06.21]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ow, ow.
[210:12.71]Yikes.
[210:14.15]Four.
[210:14.45]There's so much shit going on now.
[210:16.37]Yeah.
[210:19.78]Four more.
[210:21.10]And I get to come back.
[210:27.84]I sure wish I could assassinate things.
[210:29.72]My, uh, my things are just attacking people.
[210:32.42]I forgot about that.
[210:34.61]One more.
[210:40.80]Alright, let's go!
[210:42.86]Yeah!
[210:44.70]Yeah!
[210:46.96]Eat shit.
[210:48.98]Something tells me we're probably getting close to the boss.
[210:51.10]Yeah, we'd have to be.
[210:52.07]Or a boss.
[210:53.81]Or a shot... I... It doesn't even cost... Let's open this first.
[211:03.22]Yeah.
[211:05.66]I didn't... That was not me.
[211:12.38]Healing potion, that's good.
[211:17.01]Alright, um... I guess we're spinning it.
[211:19.07]I mean, there's a Satanic symbol on there, and... Maybe we'll get the... you can be super strong.
[211:26.35]Maybe we'll get the Satanic symbol.
[211:28.83]And that means that we become powerful.
[211:33.89]No, that doesn't look good.
[211:36.66]No, it doesn't.
[211:37.62]No, it does not!
[211:47.83]Just play it safe.
[211:49.55]Don't be a hero.
[211:58.47]Dude, you know what playing it safe was?
[212:00.00]Was not spinning the wheel.
[212:03.46]Well, there was a chest on there.
[212:05.60]Yeah, no.
[212:06.20]I mean, come on, no.
[212:08.78]You denying that we could have rolled a chest?
[212:12.50]I don't care why there has to be like 30.
[212:21.05]Do they all have to be at, like, half health?
[212:22.79]Why can't one of them just be dead?
[212:23.77]One of them, getting close, getting close.
[212:34.47]Chicken's dead.
[212:35.01]Nice work!
[212:38.35]Oh, thanks, Ms.
[212:38.99]Pauling!
[212:40.77]Why do you think I'm doing nice work here?
[212:44.20]Why do you keep saying that?
[212:45.62]Because that's my sub sound.
[212:46.70]Ms.
[212:46.86]Pauling tells me nice work.
[212:51.68]This falling is subbed to me like 200 times.
[212:54.92]She loves me.
[212:56.90]Can I spin it again?
[213:00.80]We would.
[213:01.34]We'd sit here and spin it all fucking day until we got the chest.
[213:04.02]Yeah, we would.
[213:05.16]Oh boy, that's new.
[213:07.05]Teleports you to the edge of the room.
[213:09.81]You take it.
[213:10.45]I have a spell.
[213:14.19]I like my other spell.
[213:15.01]We'll test it.
[213:15.45]I just want to see what it looks like.
[213:20.93]Is it whatever wall I'm looking at?
[213:23.38]Yeah, it is.
[213:24.60]Ah, I don't know.
[213:25.00]That is really... That magic missile one kind of sucks.
[213:28.82]Yeah, but I have a lot of plus spell damage.
[213:32.76]No, you know what?
[213:33.70]Fuck that.
[213:34.46]I know I'll do that into a cavern.
[213:38.60]Leave that on the ground where it belongs.
[213:42.02]That was just... There's nothing I can do about that.
[213:45.88]No, I went to go pick it up and my guy did his automatic shot.
[213:50.04]Oh.
[213:54.36]I hope that's a boss or something.
[213:57.39]That's about what I expected to happen.
[213:58.51]You can't pick those up once you have all these fucking familiars.
[214:00.69]Nope.
[214:00.81]We win.
[214:02.07]You get to come back.
[214:02.67]It revives it to another level?
[214:07.25]I believe it does.
[214:08.65]Yeah, okay, okay.
[214:09.45]Great!
[214:10.19]Great stuff.
[214:11.51]New area.
[214:12.17]No boss yet.
[214:14.29]Not yet.
[214:23.43]What's the plot?
[214:26.28]Um... We had... They... They killed our friend.
[214:33.68]And we want revenge.
[214:36.26]What was his name?
[214:38.99]I don't know.
[214:39.61]I don't read the manga.
[214:55.31]I'm trying to assassinate people.
[214:57.13]I'm trying to heal by getting the kill.
[214:59.15]You're preventing me from doing the thing I'm supposed to be doing.
[215:04.77]Uh, chop.
[215:05.69]Help.
[215:07.41]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[215:12.05]You know who to kill first.
[215:16.75]Well, you took care of it.
[215:18.45]I was just unlocked by you.
[215:24.76]And, like, these curses suck!
[215:28.84]Yeah, they're bad.
[215:31.78]Fucking 50 health can't do the coin healing anymore.
[215:37.32]I have 637 gold.
[215:42.86]I can't even do that.
[215:47.74]Curses removed!
[215:48.46]Oh, that's fucking great for you, dude.
[215:50.24]Thanks.
[215:52.83]It's too bad I can't pick up money to even, uh, dreamt of being able to do that.
[215:56.61]I know, that sucks.
[215:57.01]You can't even pick up money.
[216:00.09]Be careful here, because one of us is gonna get a stray bullet.
[216:02.51]Like, from... Us.
[216:04.20]One of us.
[216:05.00]Yeah.
[216:05.60]Go one at a time.
[216:06.18]Are we playing Doom?
[216:09.74]These guys blow up when they die.
[216:17.05]Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, I have to come.
[216:22.65]Don't think too deep into what you just said.
[216:25.73]And the inflection.
[216:29.19]Oh, you.
[216:30.91]No, that was not me.
[216:32.23]That was all you.
[216:34.24]This is a bad, bad, bad room.
[216:39.40]Thankfully, I just owned that guy.
[216:42.42]Kill him before he gets over here.
[216:43.34]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[216:48.76]Don't stay too long over there.
[216:53.86]I'm gonna... I'm 17 health.
[217:02.24]Do the Guardian or anything?
[217:05.80]Bad room.
[217:06.47]Bad room.
[217:07.19]I'm gonna go across.
[217:08.67]I'm going all the way across.
[217:11.01]Just go all the way across.
[217:11.89]We can just cheese them.
[217:12.77]I'm dead.
[217:15.65]But I bounced a lot of them back.
[217:17.85]Dude, what the fuck is Venom doing here?
[217:22.11]I'm gonna have to do that again.
[217:23.11]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[217:23.65]Yeah, I'm a ghost.
[217:24.33]I can- I can push him.
[217:25.53]Yeah, just push him.
[217:29.71]That guy walked off on his own.
[217:31.11]I didn't do it.
[217:34.22]Why would- I'm swinging there!
[217:35.82]I was- All I was doing was standing there swinging.
[217:40.06]Why did you jump over?
[217:41.34]Because I was- Fuck, dude!
[217:47.50]Because they were all behind me and I had to jump.
[217:52.34]WARN ME!
[217:52.88]There was no warning time.
[217:55.98]Fuck!
[217:56.68]Come on!
[217:57.12]Like, that's how the run is over?
[217:58.76]Yeah.
[218:01.25]And that's it.
[218:02.65]That's the last one.
[218:03.31]I have to go to bed.
[218:03.97]I'm not staying up for another one.
[218:05.81]Like, I'll play more another day.
[218:07.19]This was fun.
[218:08.99]That was just... I had to jump.
[218:11.37]There was nowhere to go.
[218:14.99]Man.
[218:15.37]I had to jump.
[218:16.97]I understand.
[218:17.93]You had to jump.
[218:19.23]You had to jump to not the top or the bottom of that thing.
[218:22.55]You had to jump into the middle where I was swinging.
[218:25.53]I get it.
[218:25.95]You know, it's alright.
[218:26.55]Hey, why did you die?
[218:27.43]You shouldn't have died.
[218:28.89]Why did I?
[218:29.23]Because I had 17 health, I couldn't pick up money, and I had 50 health max.
[218:34.61]Well, why did you get the thing that made it so you can't pick up money?
[218:36.81]That was a mistake.
[218:38.11]Oh my god.
[218:38.77]You can go fucking like, I'm coming.
[218:40.87]Come on, fuck.
