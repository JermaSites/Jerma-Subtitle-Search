[00:03.84]OK.
[00:06.53]Here we go.
[00:07.17]Alright, this is a slot machine kind of weird, scary kind of game.
[00:29.17]Hello, player.
[00:29.69]You're about to play a small demo version of Cloverpit.
[00:32.47]The game is an active development, and making games is hard.
[00:35.45]So if you encounter bugs, balancing issues, etc., please let us know.
[00:38.03]Alright, it's a demo.
[00:42.47]It's Balatro, but a slot machine instead of cards.
[00:44.41]That sounds kind of amazing.
[00:45.69]Uh, I did not start a run.
[00:53.12]I just opened it to make sure I could capture it correctly.
[00:54.92]These are new.
[00:58.73]Welcome.
[00:59.13]I hear you like to gamble.
[01:01.53]No need to panic.
[01:02.07]Here you can play and forget about the world outside.
[01:05.23]Now, do you need me to explain how things work?
[01:06.83]Yes, I do.
[01:07.35]Alright.
[01:08.95]Listen carefully.
[01:09.57]I won't repeat myself.
[01:12.51]This is where you must deposit the coins you earn.
[01:14.59]Okay.
[01:16.21]If you're not able to deposit enough coins in a certain amount of rounds, well, you'll find out.
[01:23.83]At the end of every round, you'll get back interest based on your current deposit of coins, right?
[01:28.49]Cool.
[01:30.09]If you deposit all the debt early, I'll reward you four clover tickets for every round left.
[01:37.20]I'll deposit coins.
[01:38.00]If you do it early, you get tickets.
[01:40.88]You'll decide how many spins to do for each round.
[01:44.56]At the end of each round, you will also receive one clover ticket, even more in certain conditions.
[01:48.52]Okay, so clover tickets are what I want to try to get.
[01:53.35]Spend your Clover tickets to buy Lucky Charms.
[01:56.17]It'll improve your odds of surviving.
[01:59.41]Store restocks for free whenever you manage to deposit the requested coins at the ATM.
[02:03.43]Alright.
[02:05.87]You're not going to remember all this anyways.
[02:09.47]True.
[02:12.74]W-A-S-D.
[02:13.56]Hold on, let me...
[02:18.40]Screen, that's fine.
[02:21.68]Other.
[02:23.10]Screen shake off.
[02:25.32]Camera sensitivity, let's make this... 60.
[02:30.38]That's a little bit more.
[02:43.61]What if the screen shake is immersive?
[02:46.21]Unfortunately, it usually doesn't matter, unfortunately.
[02:51.38]In some cases, it's fine.
[02:53.10]But we usually have to turn it off.
[02:57.46]I know that it can actually add some stuff to games, but sometimes it doesn't.
[03:00.38]I don't know what exact screen shake it is.
[03:03.25]If it's the whole entire screen, then it kind of hurts.
[03:06.85]But if it's just like a little bit on some stuff in the camera.
[03:09.31]Alright, alright, let's go.
[03:14.20]What is this?
[03:16.98]Alright, uh, let's just start it.
[03:22.36]How many spins?
[03:23.46]Seven spins is plus one ticket and seven, or three spins, which gets you two tickets and three, minus three coins.
[03:31.95]We're gonna go with three spins.
[03:35.25]Okay, let's go.
[03:40.57]Big.
[03:43.83]Was that, that wasn't big?
[03:46.61]What's a trigger?
[03:51.19]+2.
[03:51.81]How many coins do I need?
[03:52.53]I need six coins and eight tickets.
[04:08.06]Shit.
[04:09.50]Okay.
[04:11.28]No spins left.
[04:14.08]Okay, I got my two tickets.
[04:15.02]I got two coins.
[04:18.12]My interest.
[04:21.09]Alright, I got 20 coins and I need four more tickets.
[04:23.45]We can get it.
[04:26.83]Two rounds left.
[04:30.21]I need... I need 75 coins in two rounds?
[04:36.24]Shit.
[04:36.60]Okay, well.
[04:37.10]How about depositing some coins?
[04:39.30]Oh, I need interest.
[04:39.94]Right, alright.
[04:50.73]Again.
[04:57.29]Six total.
[04:57.93]Hell yeah.
[04:58.33]Alright, cool.
[05:03.23]Three?
[05:03.49]One more.
[05:07.87]That's fine.
[05:08.41]Okay, I've got one round left.
[05:09.59]I've got my two interests.
[05:10.45]I've got four tickets.
[05:12.13]You have one round left to deposit your coins.
[05:13.81]You have been warned.
[05:15.03]Wait, what?
[05:15.51]It's almost over.
[05:21.00]20% chance for coins to have the golden modifier.
[05:26.63]Oh, shit.
[05:27.37]Okay.
[05:29.85]Diamonds will have it.
[05:31.11]Coins will have it.
[05:32.85]Plus five luck on next spin if the previous two had no reward.
[05:40.42]Restock.
[05:41.44]Um... Okay.
[05:44.52]I need 70.
[05:44.86]I'm dead.
[05:45.24]I'm dead.
[05:47.20]I'm dead.
[05:51.01]I guess I have to try one of these, right?
[05:59.15]I'll do seven spins and I'll do diamonds.
[06:04.08]Diamonds and coins?
[06:04.82]I kind of have to, don't I?
[06:06.32]I'm screwed.
[06:14.55]Seven spins.
[06:15.07]Alright, come on.
[06:16.39]Something huge.
[06:20.74]Nothing.
[06:25.92]That's a lot of cherries.
[06:32.27]Not enough though.
[06:34.13]I can get something big right here.
[06:36.47]Give me a diamond.
[06:39.73]Shit.
[06:43.68]Okay.
[06:46.94]That's GG.
[06:47.70]That's game over.
[06:51.15]Cool.
[06:52.01]Alright.
[06:52.61]I get it.
[06:52.97]I did the math and not enough coins.
[06:58.13]No!
[06:59.27]I can still do it.
[06:59.89]I can still do it.
[07:05.69]Cool.
[07:12.70]Alright.
[07:17.90]150 plus lucky charms, endless mode, multiple endings, run modifiers, more, only in the full version.
[07:22.12]Cool.
[07:23.04]Alright, I get it.
[07:23.46]Alright, I need to make money.
[07:30.47]I did too many of... Okay, we're going to do... Again, this one.
[07:33.35]I want to do this one again.
[07:34.75]I want tickets.
[07:38.77]Not a great start.
[07:47.46]That's fine.
[07:47.84]Alright, that's fine.
[07:56.04]Triggers randomly.
[07:57.12]20% chance.
[07:58.82]Luck plus 5 for the current spin.
[08:01.38]Discard after 12 activations.
[08:03.24]Boy, the 7s have a chance to be lucky.
[08:08.74]Interest increased by 15%, but decreased by 3% after every round.
[08:13.63]I'm going to go for this one.
[08:17.99]I'm going for both of these.
[08:19.05]And we're doing seven spins.
[08:29.65]Why is there a shit mechanic in this game?
[08:32.74]You got a new lucky charm.
[08:37.32]What?
[08:38.64]Check the terminal?
[08:43.04]You unlocked number two.
[08:45.81]Triggered by red button.
[08:47.25]During this round, all patterns with non-yellow symbols will trigger an additional time.
[08:54.36]Okay, so if I press the red button... All patterns with non-yellow symbols... So I can do this?
[09:07.39]I just have to press this button and I can do it?
[09:11.47]Alright, seven spins.
[09:12.17]Let's go.
[09:14.66]Oh, it's an item you have to get.
[09:15.58]Alright.
[09:19.06]Alright.
[09:19.46]This is big.
[09:20.20]There's a 20% chance that anything good could happen here.
[09:24.85]Come on.
[09:28.81]Bullshit.
[09:31.55]Ooh!
[09:33.43]Oh, yeah!
[09:35.53]15.
[09:35.61]Get outta here.
[09:36.21]What a shit payout.
[09:43.59]Is that the war symbol?
[09:46.79]Come on, man.
[09:48.83]Oh!
[09:51.77]It activated.
[09:52.29]That was a good run.
[09:57.78]Okay, what do I have to add?
[10:05.54]Do I need 75 coins or can I deposit?
[10:08.40]How many can I deposit?
[10:15.06]I need 15 coins.
[10:19.93]Oh wait, I already had 30 in there?
[10:21.79]Oh, I didn't know that I already had 30 coins in there.
[10:28.97]I thought that's like how many I had to deposit for the round.
[10:31.10]Okay, I get it.
[10:31.62]So I need 15 coins.
[10:33.34]Start with 30 coins.
[10:34.12]Alright.
[10:34.40]What is this?
[10:36.86]Final reward.
[10:37.62]Alright.
[10:41.64]I need 15 coins.
[10:48.04]Should get it.
[10:50.92]Yeah, done.
[10:54.00]Eight.
[10:58.58]Come on.
[11:04.21]No, come on.
[11:07.23]There we go.
[11:07.65]Alright.
[11:08.49]Round is one.
[11:13.29]Four.
[11:17.49]Good.
[11:23.35]Good.
[11:25.93]Deposit.
[11:34.64]Hey, I did it.
[11:35.10]How about another deadline?
[11:37.08]Cool.
[11:37.42]What is it?
[11:38.90]Now you need to reach the amount of 200.
[11:39.86]And here's your deadline bonus.
[11:43.54]Don't say I didn't treat you.
[11:45.86]By the way, the cost to play the slot machine increases after every deadline.
[11:50.42]Of course it does.
[11:51.24]Okay.
[11:54.30]The phone just ring?
[11:56.30]Don't trust everyone.
[11:58.62]What's going on?
[11:59.12]Where are you?
[12:00.30]Can I eat something?
[12:01.58]Next time I'll be there.
[12:02.50]I found a winning strategy.
[12:05.72]Lucky charms at the store are discounted by one ticket.
[12:09.38]Cool.
[12:10.93]Bells manifest more often.
[12:12.47]I think I'm always going to take that.
[12:14.71]Increase the value of pattern with four plus symbols.
[12:20.41]I want more bells.
[12:25.03]I'm taking more bells.
[12:28.31]You always say that.
[12:29.17]Alright, we'll get anything that has bell on it.
[12:32.85]Fake coin.
[12:42.24]Third option was better.
[12:43.06]It's alright.
[12:47.11]Seven luck for the last spin of the round.
[12:48.75]Plus 5% to my interest.
[12:51.51]Um...
[12:56.96]Whenever three plus patterns trigger during a spin times two to all symbols.
[13:08.44]Oh shit, OK.
[13:12.16]I'm gonna go three spins.
[13:13.42]I want the tickets.
[13:17.92]Good.
[13:19.96]Oh boy, that's big.
[13:23.17]It's huge.
[13:33.82]Get that seven in there.
[13:34.72]Alright.
[13:35.08]I got 41 now.
[13:36.98]I need a hundred coins.
[13:41.42]This game is good.
[13:42.66]When does this game actually come out?
[13:43.80]Cause I'm going to be obsessed with it.
[13:53.37]Should I do more interest?
[14:03.73]It's, uh, okay.
[14:05.29]14 coins, so I can go... Okay, what does the luck stat do?
[14:14.57]Luck plus one.
[14:15.66]What does luck do?
[14:17.42]What is the tangible thing that it gives me?
[14:21.10]Is it a multiplier?
[14:21.96]Is it a... What does it mean?
[14:25.38]Just better winnings?
[14:27.78]Is each one 10%?
[14:28.42]Is there an actual tangible...
[14:34.97]So this is plus 7 luck for the last round.
[14:38.59]That's all my tickets.
[14:42.89]Alright, I'm going... 7 spins.
[14:46.36]Good.
[14:46.68]I gotta hit something huge.
[15:26.55]It wasn't worth it.
[15:27.17]That sucked!
[15:32.00]A 40-year-old man playing slots while 20 million people watch?
[15:34.48]There's like nine people here.
[15:36.46]Uh, I'm in trouble.
[15:41.04]I need 60 coins?
[15:56.65]Press the red button?
[16:05.96]What does this do?
[16:11.02]Doubt is a sellback.
[16:11.78]There's no way you're going to win this.
[16:14.94]It triggers an active item.
[16:16.00]I don't think I have any items, right?
[16:19.47]Oh, I don't have any.
[16:20.09]Okay.
[16:20.23]Alright.
[16:25.18]Need way better than that.
[16:26.92]There we go.
[16:29.84]What?
[16:30.08]How?
[16:33.20]Come on.
[16:33.84]I need the last rounds gotta be massive.
[16:35.64]I think this is it.
[16:41.19]This game over.
[16:42.99]I did get a double though.
[16:43.91]Is that worth enough?
[16:50.71]No, it's not.
[16:51.97]Damn it!
[16:53.72]Cool.
[16:53.94]Alright, this game's really fun.
[16:57.14]I'm gonna try to beat it.
[17:00.22]Let me just get that little bit of relief before I die.
[17:21.17]Alright, let's get to the end of this one.
[17:25.15]Definitely wishlisting this for sure.
[17:26.55]Alright.
[17:32.84]I like this.
[17:35.46]What's the cat?
[17:40.04]Current interest.
[17:45.68]I think the chili pepper is good.
[17:50.93]I can get them both.
[17:51.49]I can get them both.
[17:52.91]Okay, I'm going for that one after.
[17:53.85]Oh wait.
[17:54.07]Let's go for money.
[18:39.04]That could have been way better.
[18:42.88]It's got great sounds.
[18:43.66]Yeah, it really does.
[18:45.28]Ooh!
[18:45.66]Alright, we're good.
[18:49.28]I got two rounds left.
[18:53.26]Thank you, cat.
[18:56.55]Alright, so here's the question, right?
[18:58.73]I'm... I only have one ticket.
[19:06.25]Should I always deposit everything up until how many spins I want to do?
[19:09.27]I don't see why I wouldn't.
[19:16.64]How many, is this, uh, I got one more round or is this the last round?
[19:21.82]I'll get it.
[19:25.49]Two more rounds?
[19:27.77]Okay, then I definitely want... What is it, three?
[19:35.05]Two spins.
[19:35.95]Oh, okay.
[19:36.47]So it keeps going down.
[19:37.77]I get it.
[19:39.49]Two spins, you get two tickets, and it's two coins.
[19:46.93]That's good.
[19:53.34]I want the interest.
[19:59.62]I already have it.
[20:05.08]Yeah, I already got it.
[20:05.80]So... Three.
[20:08.14]Should I wait till it restocks?
[20:09.18]Or what are these?
[20:10.66]This is a trigger.
[20:13.42]More diamonds or more clovers?
[20:19.75]Probably the diamonds, right?
[20:32.69]Now...
[20:37.65]Yeah, I'm good.
[20:42.81]Just go for tickets.
[20:47.60]Just pay everything?
[20:49.16]Wait, okay.
[20:49.88]If I do it right now, do I get a bonus?
[20:51.52]Oh, I do get a bonus.
[20:54.18]Yeah, I'm doing that.
[20:58.48]That's huge.
[21:00.73]That's huge.
[21:02.19]That's huge.
[21:07.10]Alright, now I'm looking for diamond stuff.
[21:12.04]Charms with triggers randomly activate double more often.
[21:14.51]Don't I have a couple of those?
[21:23.41]Cherries manifest more.
[21:25.37]Lemons manifest more.
[21:27.09]Double the value of diamonds and coins.
[21:28.75]Holy shit.
[21:29.79]Oh yeah.
[21:32.37]I got the diamond activator.
[21:40.28]And this would be... Where can I see my items here?
[21:43.02]These are random, right?
[21:45.30]No, this one's random.
[21:50.62]So that would be... 40%?
[21:53.34]I kind of want to do that.
[21:58.47]You got mail?
[22:03.91]Where's my mail?
[22:10.78]Voicemail.
[22:18.98]Where's my mail?
[22:19.52]I got mail?
[22:21.78]On the computer?
[22:23.81]Oh, okay.
[22:26.73]So this is the one I just got.
[22:28.39]During this round, all patterns with yellow symbols will trigger additional time.
[22:32.37]Cool.
[22:35.13]I'm going to do the horseshoe.
[22:38.85]Then the chili pepper will happen twice as often.
[22:41.17]Cool.
[22:41.55]Alright.
[22:42.73]What can I do now?
[22:44.79]I'm gonna go with the four spins.
[22:48.26]And we're gonna activate the button.
[22:52.66]Activate button.
[22:53.50]Four spins.
[22:54.92]Huge diamonds.
[22:56.62]We good?
[23:02.53]Cool.
[23:04.33]Big money.
[23:07.66]That's absolutely massive.
[23:14.00]Oh, that's gigantic.
[23:20.31]More diamonds.
[23:20.93]I already beat it.
[23:30.22]Not quite actually.
[23:33.99]Alright, what does it cost?
[23:35.59]Seven spins is 14.
[23:36.61]So let me get to 14.
[23:38.66]That's 11 in interest.
[23:53.50]I feel like I should get this too.
[23:54.62]Because that will get doubled up from the, uh, from the other one.
[24:00.68]What do these ones do?
[24:02.50]Car Battery and Red Shiny Ruck.
[24:08.12]Luck plus four for next spin.
[24:11.37]Doesn't take space.
[24:12.53]Restores all charges on all equipped Lucky Charms.
[24:16.53]Cool.
[24:16.95]Alright, let's do it.
[24:18.93]By the way, we're doing this.
[24:19.77]We're doing it right now.
[24:21.61]Another activation.
[24:24.53]Diamonds.
[24:26.19]Big.
[24:33.55]Diamonds.
[24:33.87]We're not... This is bad.
[24:43.15]That's alright.
[24:46.33]That's better.
[24:48.45]Why am I talking like this?
[24:55.08]Level up.
[24:57.12]Oh, it's diamonds!
[25:01.76]And then...
[25:12.58]That's it?
[25:13.32]Okay.
[25:14.06]Cool.
[25:18.06]Now I get 4 tickets and 12 coins if I put it all in.
[25:23.97]But I think if I just do another round I can get even more.
[25:26.85]Do you keep the money going forward or is it only 200?
[25:28.57]That's it.
[25:33.11]Definitely go for the bonus.
[25:34.80]Always deposit early.
[25:37.90]Tickets are worth more.
[25:38.56]You always want the tickets.
[25:39.98]You will keep the leftover.
[25:41.10]Okay.
[25:47.18]You can now encounter the pattern 666.
[25:49.16]If you score it at the slot machine, you'll lose all money earned.
[25:53.56]What?
[25:55.66]You need to reach the amount of 666.
[25:56.62]Oh.
[25:56.72]Hello!
[26:04.30]Why not enjoy yourself a little bit?
[26:06.68]I don't care about it.
[26:07.22]Make two random Lucky Charms in the store free.
[26:11.86]Uh... Have the chances to manifest lemons and cherries permanently.
[26:17.47]Yep.
[26:20.51]Absolutely this one.
[26:23.13]That means more diamonds.
[26:26.33]Get rid of these other symbols, yeah.
[26:35.32]Okay, coins and diamonds are going to show up way more, so it's going to be this one.
[26:45.62]Okay, what happens if I replace my active?
[26:52.40]I can do this two more times.
[26:54.60]Maybe just reroll the shop.
[26:56.16]33 coins.
[26:57.34]I need 666.
[27:02.24]You can add more than one active.
[27:03.99]Oh, they don't get replaced.
[27:09.44]So wouldn't I be able to just do it active every single turn?
[27:11.84]I feel like I want this one.
[27:16.93]Because there's going to be more coins in the machine now.
[27:32.34]What is it to do a spin?
[27:33.40]Alright, I need 28 coins to do 7.
[27:48.15]Let's go.
[27:51.93]Do it.
[27:56.71]Full screen.
[27:58.70]Oh, it's a full screen.
[28:00.60]Damn.
[28:06.80]I wish they were diamonds, but that's good.
[28:15.16]Why are we getting so many bells?
[28:24.96]I'd love to have it be diamonds.
[28:26.22]That'd be so much better.
[28:29.72]Like that.
[28:36.08]I might have already beat it.
[28:43.75]Removing symbols, that's the best thing you can possibly do in this whole game.
[28:49.75]That's almost another full screen of seven.
[28:52.16]GG.
[28:58.60]I can beat it right now.
[29:07.05]Okay, but I'm not gonna do that.
[29:12.88]I'm gonna deposit up until 665.
[29:14.30]It's eight tickets?
[29:22.67]Do it, do it, do it.
[29:25.83]I mean, it is eight tickets.
[29:36.64]I could do another round, though.
[29:39.53]Two rounds early?
[29:40.69]I guess eight tickets two rounds early is crazy.
[29:46.47]Buy the battery.
[29:51.25]You could get 666 and lose all your money.
[29:53.93]Yeah, there's only a 1.5% chance.
[29:56.07]Give me the battery.
[30:02.98]Alright, let's do it.
[30:07.92]Congratulations again, but you'd never have enough, am I right?
[30:10.26]I need to reach 2,222.
[30:12.22]Okay.
[30:12.64]I have a ton of tickets.
[30:26.05]Add the Florid modifier plus one ticket when deadline ends to a random Lucky Charm you have equipped.
[30:33.11]Lucky Charms at the store are discounted by one until the next restock.
[30:36.35]That's huge.
[30:38.46]Double the va- Okay.
[30:51.68]More interest?
[30:57.86]Symbols plus one for every five you own.
[31:04.93]Should I do this?
[31:08.64]The interest is going to be kind of crazy.
[31:10.12]I could roll it.
[31:12.00]That's a ton.
[31:12.84]That's too much to roll.
[31:17.90]Re-roll it?
[31:18.40]100 coins?
[31:19.35]How much is it to do it?
[31:21.93]Okay, it's 42.
[31:25.71]To roll.
[31:31.19]Nuclear button.
[31:34.41]All charms triggered by the red button.
[31:36.35]Trigger one more time.
[31:38.34]Damn.
[31:44.58]Oh, what did I just get?
[31:45.32]Okay.
[31:50.70]Well, that's just the same one.
[31:56.68]Florid red crystal.
[32:00.66]Stain.
[32:02.60]Whatever three plus patterns trigger during a spin increase all patterns by their base value.
[32:07.03]Oh my God.
[32:10.27]More interest.
[32:12.85]Seems amazing.
[32:17.81]Maybe just more luck.
[32:22.49]Or more interest?
[32:27.61]Because I can have more than one active, right?
[32:34.87]You've reached the Lucky Charms limit.
[32:37.38]What?
[32:37.52]What?
[32:41.40]Honestly, though, how many can I have?
[32:42.20]People didn't like that one, apparently.
[33:18.72]My luck is maxed regardless?
[33:20.90]I'll take the interest then.
[33:23.42]No!
[33:25.96]This one's cool.
[33:27.20]Put it in his draw?
[33:30.82]Coins.
[33:40.30]This one's good.
[33:41.00]Should I just go?
[33:45.50]Should I just spin?
[33:57.62]Diamonds are... the diamonds are worth a ton, by the way.
[34:00.22]Remember that.
[34:02.14]It's so much.
[34:04.40]Come on, diamond.
[34:06.28]No!
[34:07.92]Get that shit out of the way.
[34:10.80]Although that was pretty huge.
[34:13.54]Diamond!
[34:16.30]Meh.
[34:20.49]Nobody wants lemons.
[34:25.76]Diamond!
[34:31.04]Ooh!
[34:37.11]Kind of big.
[34:38.95]What just happened to that?
[34:44.07]Did I just eat it?
[34:48.37]It's limited.
[34:50.03]Ah!
[34:50.18]Okay, so that was the... That was the luck one.
[34:56.67]So I should get the shiny red rock now, right?
[34:58.67]Because that's guaranteed luck.
[35:06.13]Hell yeah.
[35:06.79]Okay.
[35:07.75]And interest.
[35:08.21]Alright, speaking of interest.
[35:12.88]I need 42, 42.
[35:14.04]I have two rounds left, right?
[35:20.34]Let's go.
[35:23.66]Let's go, Gatling.
[35:29.14]When Poke played this, he said it's the most Jerma-coded game of all time.
[35:35.66]That thing's gone now, too.
[35:42.63]I mean, I love it so far.
[35:44.15]I think it's great.
[35:50.41]Should I hit it again?
[35:50.93]Hit it again?
[36:06.45]Don't do this to me.
[36:09.85]Don't do this to me.
[36:13.47]Don't do this to me!
[36:20.70]What do I need?
[36:21.16]Okay, I need like 500 coins?
[36:32.66]This is gonna be fucking impossible.
[36:37.30]I don't have any room for anything.
[36:38.36]Uh, I'm gonna have to reroll, I think.
[36:47.12]Need room for one item.
[36:52.44]I mean, I could do the interest, but will that be enough?
[36:56.50]15% more interest?
[36:59.68]Buy them both?
[37:02.66]I might be able to do it with interest.
[37:12.48]I'm going to get 363 coins with interest.
[37:15.20]I'm good.
[37:15.74]No, I'm good.
[37:16.22]I'm absolutely fine.
[37:25.45]I actually have a break coming up here too.
[37:28.26]So after this spin here, after these spins, we'll take a break.
[37:32.70]Yeah, I got it.
[37:43.23]Fuck.
[37:44.65]This is bad.
[37:52.19]This is bad.
[37:57.42]Is it enough?
[37:59.64]Yeah, it's enough.
[38:01.18]Yeah!
[38:04.38]We're good.
[38:09.50]Cool.
[38:10.08]Okay.
[38:12.12]Let's do this and then I'm going to take a break.
[38:19.62]12,500 is the next deadline.
[38:20.79]That's going to be insane.
[38:21.53]Oh my God.
[38:23.95]What the hell was that?
[38:26.27]Oh, okay.
[38:26.77]Alright.
[38:28.25]Ads are going to start.
[38:29.91]See you in a few minutes.
[38:31.97]Holy shit.
[38:32.37]I'll be right back.
[38:36.59]Get up and move around if you need to.
[38:39.96]Will I actually beat it?
[38:43.70]I might beat it.
[42:10.61]About 15 seconds.
[42:12.41]How are you?
[42:14.85]This game's good.
[42:15.51]I like it a lot.
[42:17.74]I thought you finished Chrono.
[42:22.08]I did not.
[42:24.82]I didn't want to rush the finale because the last 30, 40 minutes of the game is actually really, really cool.
[42:32.13]So I'd like to, I want to go through it at a slower pace rather than run through it at 3 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[42:42.15]Alright, let's go.
[42:42.73]Final.
[42:43.03]Let's see if I can do it.
[42:51.78]15,000 coins.
[42:54.22]One more phone.
[42:56.96]Alright, straight up five tickets.
[43:00.24]Add the ambitious modifier to a random lucky charm you have.
[43:06.71]It's got to be diamond, right?
[43:07.79]It has to be.
[43:17.57]How many uses does this have?
[43:18.59]One more use.
[43:21.61]Shit, I kind of need to refill it.
[43:24.37]Oh, there we go.
[43:26.89]That's a big deal.
[43:32.21]If a 666 is going to trigger, transform it into normal symbols.
[43:40.68]Oh, wait a minute.
[43:45.38]Uh, I gotta replace something.
[43:50.56]But that interest could save the whole run, though.
[44:03.11]Yeah, who cares about the coin?
[44:05.11]What happens if I put it in the drawers?
[44:06.25]Is it that I can just use it later?
[44:09.41]Just throw it away?
[44:10.57]I'll just throw it away.
[44:22.34]Alright, this is a big deal.
[44:25.06]20% chance for diamonds to be golden diamonds.
[44:30.21]And that's what we're gonna do.
[44:31.41]Okay.
[44:31.93]How much do I need?
[44:32.47]56 coins to do seven spins.
[44:37.01]Ah!
[44:39.61]Can I take it out?
[44:41.25]Can I take the coins out?
[44:48.44]Ah!
[44:51.12]Damn it.
[44:51.84]It's okay.
[44:55.09]It's alright.
[44:56.01]Here we go.
[45:02.03]Massive.
[45:02.97]Absolutely destructively huge.
[45:12.94]Come on.
[45:14.78]Do it again.
[45:19.04]Uh-oh.
[45:26.85]this shit out of me oh no do I lose 1.6% chance for that to happen well that sucks that just took all the momentum away
[46:06.78]No, I gotta get really lucky now.
[46:15.64]Shit.
[46:33.76]Bible would have saved you?
[46:34.91]I know!
[46:36.53]That's a disaster.
[46:37.47]Actually a disaster.
[46:38.27]I need a full screen of diamonds right here.
[46:47.99]That's... good, but not great.
[46:54.34]Ah, what a pain in the ass.
[46:55.72]I still might be able to do it.
[47:00.90]That's actually a big deal.
[47:02.36]That actually may have saved everything.
[47:11.36]Alright, hold on.
[47:13.71]That's a big deal.
[47:16.17]That's a big deal.
[47:17.43]See, that's a big deal.
[47:18.25]I'm just like every person in Vegas.
[47:22.15]Now, can you imagine if those top two, if the top left and then one right next to it were a diamond?
[47:28.36]That's $400,000.
[47:28.70]I mean, that's huge.
[47:29.38]That would be big.
[47:47.08]Holy shit.
[47:47.96]I actually might do it.
[47:51.40]I got a couple more rounds.
[47:52.28]No, I'm gonna beat it.
[47:52.86]The machine is hot right now.
[48:04.05]I think with the interest for next round, I think I actually got it.
[48:15.37]Yeah, there's no way I lose.
[48:21.43]There's no way I lose this.
[48:22.34]I need 56.
[48:22.76]I'm gonna keep what I got.
[48:41.83]Okay, I get 1194 from interest.
[48:46.14]I won!
[48:46.72]The game over!
[48:47.56]That was a win, right?
[48:54.60]I need to get 500 coins.
[49:01.11]Can't count?
[49:02.61]Yeah, but I need like a thousand coins.
[49:04.31]I've got it.
[49:05.99]What if you get 666?
[49:06.97]That's not gonna happen twice in a row.
[49:08.75]All my shit's charged up again.
[49:14.38]I got at least one super diamond spin.
[49:19.12]Let's go.
[49:21.12]Ride or die.
[49:23.28]Ride or die!
[49:38.73]I need more diamonds than that.
[49:43.41]No, it's alright.
[49:45.25]I think I won.
[49:45.99]I think that's a win.
[49:46.75]I need like a thousand more coins.
[49:47.97]Come on, diamonds.
[49:50.21]That's big.
[49:52.13]Stop saying that.
[49:55.93]Stop saying, I need a thousand coins.
[49:59.91]This is, it's all on this right now.
[50:01.85]One, two, three, go.
[50:06.00]That actually might be it.
[50:07.56]I think I just did it.
[50:11.95]Is that it?
[50:12.29]Did I win?
[50:22.25]Yes!
[50:24.88]I did it!
[50:25.24]Hooray!
[50:29.90]I get my golden coin.
[50:32.60]My ticket.
[50:36.24]Here's a voucher.
[50:36.86]In the full version, you'll start with a draw unlocked.
[50:39.82]Now I guess it's time to say goodbye.
[50:41.32]Remember to wishlist.
[50:48.58]Wait, does that carry over into the game?
[50:52.64]That's a big, uh... That's a big payout to the believers.
[50:55.70]Only 35% said I was gonna do it.
[50:57.34]65% of you said no.
[51:05.00]3.5 million channel points were on the line there.
[51:08.32]On the nose.
[51:13.48]Very cool.
[51:16.33]I loved it.
[51:16.71]I thought it was great.
[51:19.13]Clover Pit.
[51:20.73]Game is called Clover Pit.
[51:22.79]It's on Steam.
[51:24.29]You can play the demo I just played right now.
[51:25.67]That was great.
[51:29.39]Go on.
[51:30.09]Alright, cool.
[51:32.35]Oh, here are the symbols.
[51:33.18]Alright.
[51:35.67]7's the best.
[51:36.07]Diamond actually was one of the best symbols you get.
[51:44.67]Cool.
[51:45.97]Okay.
[51:50.05]Patterns are on the other wall, too.
[51:53.49]Oh.
[51:53.81]Yeah, that's times 10.
[51:56.21]10x, 8x.
[51:57.75]I is 8x.
[51:58.45]I feel like I got this at one point.
[52:05.79]Don't ever doubt the God Gambler.
[52:10.56]Uh... I would, yeah, I would doubt gambling every time.
[52:14.56]And it's very nature you should doubt that it's possible.
[52:17.99]Permanently, period, ever.
[52:19.21]Oh, I hate that noise.
[52:25.22]Alright, I think I want to give a solid couple of hours for Chrono Trigger.
[52:31.00]At least here.
[52:32.82]So those were the couple of demos I wanted to do.
[52:34.46]I had my eye on them for a while.
[52:36.24]They were very fun.
[52:38.72]It's time to get to the end of Chrono Trigger.
[52:40.56]This is the last time you're going to see Chrono Trigger.
[52:44.16]After this, the kind of next playthrough, the next thing I'm going to play play, will be Dracula 3.
[52:56.84]If you'd like to continue to hang out with us.
[52:59.84]Hang out with us for a little while.
[53:00.80]We're going to be playing Chrono Trigger.
[53:03.00]Getting to the end.
[53:05.07]That's what's going to happen right now.
[53:08.79]If not, maybe we'll see you again next time.
[53:10.79]The next stream will probably be at some point this weekend.
[53:17.45]Do some weekend streams.
[53:21.57]I like streaming on the weekend.
[53:22.47]It's fun.
[53:25.79]I mean, it could be a, it might be a bush light Sunday.
[53:29.76]Who knows?
