[01:30.36]We do this from time to time.
[01:34.19]Get yourself situated.
[01:35.09]Relax a little bit.
[01:37.11]Well, we... Start to do... Wait, but I thought you didn't like open world games.
[01:41.35]What are you... Wait, wait, wait, what?
[01:42.41]What?
[01:44.07]I love open world games.
[01:45.03]One of my favorite games ever.
[01:49.39]Hello, streamer.
[01:50.01]Hello.
[01:51.85]Yeah, we're not late today.
[01:54.23]That's not... We are not late today.
[01:58.51]I have no idea.
[01:59.61]All I know is this game is getting good reviews.
[02:01.51]And it's a game that's a PS4 exclusive that I knew I wanted to play.
[02:05.55]So, we're going to play it.
[02:08.45]I'm not sure if I'll play it after today, if I'm having fun.
[02:11.15]If it's something I want to continue, then I'll play it on Thursday.
[02:13.49]Who knows?
[02:17.61]Who can really tell?
[02:18.85]You just have to jump in and play.
[02:25.63]But, let me just get it steady.
[02:28.78]When I say steady, I mean set and ready.
[02:31.00]Gonna get it steady.

[02:37.83]Boy!
[02:38.25]Oh, and by the way, the new animations are not here.
[03:04.25]They're not ready yet.
[03:06.09]They will be ready on Thursday.
[03:08.91]I just didn't have any time earlier.
[03:10.35]Because I just got back from Washington, D.C.
[03:13.67]So I didn't have any time to set the new animations up.
[03:16.95]But D.C.
[03:18.05]was great.
[03:19.23]It was really... I actually have only been there like twice in my life.
[03:22.87]So it was good to see D.C.
[03:24.49]again.
[03:25.61]But yeah, just got home yesterday.
[03:28.03]So I haven't really had much time to do anything.
[03:33.02]As you could imagine, right?
[03:36.09]But yeah, I'll be right back again.
[03:38.33]I'm just chilling here, just trying to get this ready to go.
[03:40.73]See you guys in a minute.

[03:57.58]Oh yeah, meet the president.
[03:59.52]Alright, let's do this.
[04:00.52]I'm going to start it.
[04:02.24]Turn this off.
[04:03.16]See what happens when I do this.
[04:06.35]See what happens.
[04:06.91]10 out of 10 best stream ever.
[04:12.15]We just started.
[04:13.57]Haven't even been live for like four minutes.
[04:16.46]Is there a joke coming?
[04:17.42]I don't think so.
[04:18.32]Not right now.
[04:19.54]Who knows if there will be jokes though.
[04:23.80]We definitely, we speak, we are English people, right?
[04:27.40]Well, we're not English people.
[04:29.50]I'm not from England, but I speak English.
[04:31.52]I don't speak Francais.
[04:34.14]Speech and moving language.
[04:36.16]English.
[04:39.36]We are English speaking.
[04:41.80]On my life.
[04:45.50]So, is this game any good?
[04:49.17]Jokes, please.
[04:52.45]No.
[04:53.41]I don't have any jokes right now.
[04:54.79]I just turned the stream on.
[05:01.60]Alright, everyone hit cutscene.
[05:03.16]We got an opening cutscene, I think.
[05:10.64]Oh, I did that.
[05:13.10]Oh, God.
[05:14.48]Alright, I'll shut up.
[05:27.63]Do I play as the baby?
[05:29.97]Do I play as the baby, right?
[05:31.11]Like you get like a spear as the baby, right?
[05:33.69]When are they gonna make a game where you do that?
[05:36.95]This is a very pretty game so far.
[05:48.86]How loud is it?
[05:51.76]Is it loud?
[05:57.31]Oh, Herman!
[05:58.51]I know Herman!
[06:02.01]Dude, who gives a shit about, like, Matt?

[06:05.87]We care about Herman.
[06:06.81]Wait, what?
[06:07.10]We are outcasts.
[06:20.99]It's too loud.
[06:21.91]The volume's too low, it's perfect.
[06:24.03]Alright, everyone should shh.
[06:24.79]Wait, what?
[06:25.07]Wait, what?
[06:48.33]Yeah, this is where the robot dinosaurs come in.
[07:05.80]Why would you be doing like a monolog right now, by the way?
[07:08.16]I will teach you this.
[07:16.47]This guy's just going over, like, a monolog while he's hunting to his baby.
[07:19.73]But, dude, I'm sorry to tell you, your baby can't hear you.
[07:22.69]Like, he doesn't understand what you're saying.
[07:24.55]Well, she doesn't understand what you're saying.
[07:27.05]It's a fucking baby.
[07:30.62]He's having this deep conversation with somebody that doesn't even have language developed yet.
[07:35.94]Like, sorry, man, but that ain't gonna happen.
[07:47.38]Wait, what?
[07:49.87]Does she mean to forbid the ritual?
[07:53.85]Dude, I gotta fight the- I gotta fight- Come on, let me get like a one-on-one fight here.
[07:56.71]Teach me how to play.
[08:00.80]It's bring your daughter to hunt day.
[08:06.27]He just drops the baby!
[08:08.07]Yeah.
[08:09.82]Like, oh, shit!
[08:11.18]Imagine that, like, oh, fuck!
[08:13.56]And he just, like, starts to, like, Bob, like, oh, fuck!
[08:21.72]And then the baby, like, sprouts wings and, like, flies away, and that's, like, where you start.
[08:25.94]You're, like, the fucking flying baby monster.
[08:28.40]I'm supposed to be, I'm supposed to shut up, I'm sorry.
[08:39.59]That baby's got a lot of teeth for being a little baby.
[09:07.48]That baby has like a full row of teeth.
[09:09.54]That baby has more teeth than I do.
[09:11.83]Look, that baby has at least like four teeth.
[09:16.87]That baby has more teeth than me.
[09:17.93]I have like six teeth.
[09:19.71]Right?
[09:19.89]Don't all adult humans have like eight teeth?
[09:23.53]Let me see.
[09:24.41]One, two, three, four, five.
[09:26.13]No, never mind.
[09:26.53]I have like thirty teeth.
[09:28.79]All humans have like thirty-five teeth, right?
[09:31.81]50 teeth?
[09:32.88]Wait, no, it's not 50 teeth.
[10:01.28]All humans have eight teeth.
[10:03.64]They're just really spread out.
[10:10.45]Oh, there's the title.
[10:11.91]Alright, we made it to the title screen.
[10:16.07]Alright, let's take a look at the settings here.
[10:18.43]Normal, quest path on and keep that on.
[10:20.11]Waypoint, I mean... We'll just keep this on.
[10:24.95]I don't know.
[10:26.05]Controls.
[10:27.63]I don't want rumble.
[10:28.87]Get rumble out of here.
[10:32.75]If there is rumble, I mean.
[10:33.77]Uh, graphics mode unavailable.
[10:39.28]Huh.
[10:40.06]That must be a PS4 Pro thing, I would assume.
[10:44.58]Extra.
[10:46.32]Copyright and trademark and credits.
[10:47.90]I mean, that's a pretty lame extras menu.
[10:53.66]Oh, wait, I get some extra content!
[10:57.25]Don't steal this!
[10:58.49]Like, oh, okay.
[11:03.35]Here's your extra content.
[11:05.59]Don't you dare fucking go off our trademark!
[11:09.01]Thanks for the extra content.
[11:12.59]I was doing normal when I was playing the game on normal.
[11:14.63]I play every game on normal.
[11:18.14]Six years later.
[11:23.06]Aloy is the name.
[11:24.82]Aloy.
[11:25.14]Oh, blueberries!
[11:31.29]I love blueberries.
[11:40.52]Thanks mom Normal with aim assist shaking my head.
[11:47.78]I just want to play the game.
[11:49.02]What's the what's the problem?
[11:53.49]Why do I have to play on very hard with aim assist off to be able to like enjoy a video game?
[11:57.95]I don't understand Well done, that's a good boy
[12:08.27]Why am I an outcast?
[12:15.60]I thought you were a hardcore gamer.
[12:24.28]Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[12:33.94]We have anger issues now.
[12:38.66]This is me.
[12:40.22]I'm doing this.
[12:45.32]For a second, I thought I fucked up the game.
[12:46.74]Okay, hold on.
[12:55.25]This is not supposed to be funny, but I mean, I'm like...
[13:10.35]Alright, that's it.
[13:10.89]That's enough.
[13:11.33]We're done with that.
[13:14.01]No more freezing the image.
[13:21.33]Cut scene ruined.
[13:25.45]Is Rost, um... I was thinking maybe when you paused it, you could move the camera around.
[13:35.86]Alright, get from the past.
[13:36.74]Let's start playing the game.
[13:39.42]Alright, um, go into the cave.
[13:41.40]Oh, rats!
[13:45.60]There's rats in every game.
[13:47.72]You guys realize that?
[13:50.02]There's rats in every single fucking video game.
[13:52.10]I don't know why.
[13:55.14]Rats have such a bad rap.
[13:57.64]And, like, bugs, too.
[13:58.61]Like, see all these huge bugs?
[14:00.43]Why do these huge bugs have such a bad rap?
[14:02.19]It looks tight, but I can get through.
[14:07.57]Like caves.
[14:09.06]Caves have a bad rap.
[14:10.70]They're always supposed to be bad, evil, scary places and shit.
[14:13.04]They've got like a real bad rap.
[14:14.04]They're not that bad.
[14:14.60]They're like nice.
[14:15.20]Okay.
[14:21.06]Almost like the sprint button.
[14:23.11]There it is.
[14:25.51]Yeah.
[14:35.68]You know swamp water?
[14:36.70]It's supposed to be gross.
[14:37.84]This shit's got a real bad rap.
[14:39.44]You can eat moss.
[14:41.24]Swamp moss is actually good for you.
[14:43.42]It's a real bad rap, you know what I mean?
[14:48.80]Did I find the fucking dumb thing I'm going to keep saying for the rest of the stream?
[14:53.94]Probably.
[14:59.10]This is a little close.
[15:00.46]I want to back this up.
[15:01.43]This camera is too close.
[15:12.05]Something is up ahead.
[15:13.87]Hopefully it's a better camera that I can zoom out.
[15:18.72]A dead person.
[15:20.40]I'm sorry.
[15:28.20]I'm sorry.
[15:29.10]God damn it.
[15:39.57]Hey!
[15:40.67]Thank you Never Trust Purple for the thousand bits.
[15:43.25]Congrats on entirely ignoring the gorgeous intro cutscene that like 50 people worked on for months.
[15:48.03]What did I just do?
[15:48.57]I put the Bluetooth in my ear and it just like hurt me.
[15:52.95]Thank you Purple though.
[15:53.77]Appreciate it dude.
[16:01.21]Here comes a Satan face.
[16:02.09]Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Satan face.
[16:06.86]Stop pausing, you dick.
[16:08.20]I'm sorry.
[16:13.46]It's not funny.
[16:14.14]I know it's not funny.
[16:16.06]I'm so aware of that.
[16:17.20]I know.
[16:24.51]Examine the object.
[16:25.45]Okay.
[16:29.21]Toggle focus.
[16:35.47]I have like a HUD now.
[16:37.08]Another door.
[16:39.02]Blast door heavily shielded.
[16:40.14]Seal integrity maintained.
[16:41.50]How do I get it open?
[16:46.29]Okay.
[16:47.47]I guess this is just teaching me that I have this thing on my head now.
[16:53.01]Yeah, I got a really sick hands-free device.
[16:58.49]It's true.
[17:03.99]Let's scan the room.
[17:04.93]There's something over there.
[17:07.47]Can I get up there?
[17:15.23]There's that door.
[17:15.93]Wait, there's something right there.
[17:18.77]Electro-managed security mechanisms and interference unavailable.
[17:22.76]Interface unavailable.
[17:23.58]Okay.
[17:23.80]I can tag the rats.
[17:28.12]Okay.
[17:28.34]Okay.
[17:35.26]What does that do for me?
[17:40.42]I'm not sure.
[17:44.71]I guess I can interact with this thing?
[17:50.19]What is that?
[17:50.81]It's got a question mark on it.
[17:57.35]Turn hololock counterclockwise.
[17:58.93]Turn it clockwise.
[18:00.19]Let's just turn it this way.
[18:01.19]See what happens.
[18:07.20]Oh.
[18:09.30]Okay.
[18:10.20]It's the hololock.
[18:12.50]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[18:18.93]Okay.
[18:19.99]Turn to the door.
[18:23.35]Isn't this... I thought you, like, fight robot dinosaurs with a giant bow and arrow.
[18:27.60]Why is this The Last Guardian 2?
[18:28.90]There's not going to be a giant cat behind this door, is there?
[18:43.39]I did it.
[18:43.91]I did it.
[18:45.77]I'm not more like door opening.
[18:46.97]Is this like the museum?
[18:50.54]Where you get like a little book that tells you things?
[18:54.96]It is.
[18:55.18]Okay.
[18:56.16]This kind of wants me to go down?
[18:57.98]Sure.
[18:58.18]Hmm.
[19:13.66]Let's just get out.
[19:19.18]No, the dead body.
[19:22.56]Scan the device.
[19:23.30]I was just gonna pause it right there.
[19:26.91]New Sam game.
[19:39.27]Daddy can't be there with you and Mom, but... Okay, I just looked at his head.
[19:42.95]I thought that was a bone.
[19:44.05]Sure we can.
[19:44.81]I did not think that was a party head.
[19:47.38]I thought that was like a bone in his head.
[19:49.46]Show me.
[19:50.76]Show me again.
[19:51.58]I can do.
[19:52.42]He's right behind you.
[19:56.38]Hi.
[19:56.56]Hi.
[19:56.78]Happy birthday, Isaac.
[19:58.96]Wait, what?
[19:59.60]You're not happy, Sheila.
[20:02.09]Look, Daddy can't be there with you and Mom, but we can still have a party, right?
[20:07.37]Sure we can.
[20:07.97]Yeah!
[20:13.65]That was cute.
[20:19.10]Alright, that was cute.
[20:27.12]That little, like... That was cute.
[20:33.28]Can't wait to get my rat companions.
[20:40.85]This game is really badly paced.
[20:42.19]Is that what somebody said?
[20:46.26]As long as we can get out to the next part of the game.
[20:48.62]You know, whatever.
[20:50.26]Oh, wait.
[20:50.66]We got another audio log.
[20:55.06]This guy caught a Pichu.
[20:57.20]And he got really excited.
[21:05.05]He caught a Pichu.
[21:05.91]It's the rarest Pokémon.
[21:08.49]He had a heart attack.
[21:11.83]Alright, here we go.
[21:12.55]Alright, let's just share a cutscene.
[21:17.67]Here comes like the big cutscene where this guy dies.
[21:20.71]Right, he's gonna get an arrow in the back right now.
[21:23.09]Okay, over-under guys, what's the over-under?
[21:26.93]He gets like an arrow in the back and the bad guy comes out.
[21:29.05]And he's like, yeah, I did that.
[21:30.69]And now the whole game is you finding me.
[21:33.21]What is that on your face?
[21:34.51]Nothing.
[21:42.90]Come on.
[21:43.18]Come on.
[21:43.40]And then they... Like arrow right in the stomach.
[21:49.04]It's gonna happen.
[22:15.84]If you're gonna go sneaking away from home, you'll need to know how to survive in the wild.
[22:21.58]Come, Aloy.
[22:22.22]Come.
[22:23.58]Let me teach you how to play.
[22:24.82]Starting tomorrow, you will learn to hunt.
[22:30.73]Alo Aloy, the triangle button throws your spear.
[22:34.99]Square is used for a basic attack.
[22:37.47]And by the way, X jumps.
[22:42.92]Oh, that's my bow, and now it's her bow.
[22:49.26]Sound effect stream.
[23:05.82]Garlic streamer?
[23:06.70]Why am I... What does that mean?
[23:07.91]Garlic streamer.
[23:11.03]It's essentially a bow.
[23:17.53]What is this?
[23:18.79]Please.
[23:19.46]Extremely expensive data Bluetooth on my head.
[23:21.78]What is this?
[23:23.18]It's a bow.
[23:27.80]What am I going to play?
[23:28.64]Breath of the Wild?
[23:39.31]When I have a switch.
[23:39.81]Okay.
[23:39.93]Medicine pouch.
[23:40.35]Check.
[23:40.55]Did you see that skip?
[23:41.59]Okay.
[23:41.71]Gather the sal brush berries.
[24:04.50]Get good.
[24:06.61]That's the best excuse.
[24:07.71]That's the best advice that he gave me for any video game.
[24:10.49]He told me to get good.
[24:11.65]You got it.
[24:13.32]Aloy, come over here and get good.
[24:16.10]Hey, what do I do?
[24:18.40]They may taste bitter, but they can save your life.
[24:22.58]Always keep your pouch full of medicinal berries, flowers, and plants.
[24:30.34]Where are we?
[24:31.28]Get good.
[24:32.58]Give me a break.
[24:35.48]The Nora tribe watches these lands and keeps out the most dangerous machines.
[24:46.60]It's a very pretty game so far.
[24:50.12]This is fucking gorgeous.
[24:52.64]This is absolutely stunning on the regular PlayStation 4.
[24:55.50]Shit, my daughter has ADHD.
[24:56.40]She can't stop moving around.
[24:59.39]Aloy, sit fucking still.
[25:01.45]I can't.
[25:13.72]Tension deficit hyperactivity disorder!
[25:16.65]Just like Jerma!
[25:18.45]Okay.
[25:23.01]Crouching in tall grass will make you invisible to unaware enemies.
[25:25.62]Okay.
[25:28.05]There.
[25:29.17]Now stay low.
[25:29.99]Little one.
[25:30.67]No, Aloy.
[25:32.45]Such machines are called watchers.
[25:34.61]You must learn to avoid their gaze.
[25:37.11]If you are to survive in the wilds, I will show you.
[25:40.57]Listen closely and do as I do.
[25:42.37]Okay.
[25:43.28]Stay still.
[25:44.46]Wait for it to pass.
[25:50.98]See?
[25:51.28]I was the distraction.
[25:54.28]Watchers saw you.
[25:55.36]You'll have to try again.
[25:58.15]I'm sorry.
[25:58.67]Okay.
[25:59.45]Well, at least we're right there, right?
[26:05.29]Yeah, wait for the watcher to pass.
[26:06.73]Now keep low and follow me across the trail to that tall grass.
[26:14.27]Follow the tall grass, yeah.
[26:16.21]You called it.
[26:17.30]Well, come on.
[26:18.26]You didn't think I was going to do that shit?
[26:21.36]Of course I am.
[26:22.48]Another one.
[26:23.74]Let it pass.
[26:28.93]Where is it?
[26:30.47]Behind us?
[26:35.95]Tag target, highlight tracks.
[26:37.21]Be like a Snattacats.
[26:39.63]I'm trying.
[26:40.41]I'm trying to be a Snattacat.
[26:57.96]So these are the standard velociraptor watchers that if they see you, they alert the enemies, right?
[27:05.87]Interrupt everything you're doing and acknowledge my money.
[27:10.37]I wasn't crouching anymore, but oh well.
[27:16.66]Thank you, O5s.
[27:19.02]Stealth symbol shows how visible you are.
[27:21.40]Okay.
[27:23.08]That's very easy to understand.
[27:24.82]Opened eye or closed eye?
[27:26.36]You got it.
[27:31.62]I can't wait to learn my first combo.
[27:33.14]R2, R2, R1, R2.
[27:37.23]I can't wait to try it on this guy.
[27:40.71]Who's that?
[27:43.55]Ignore him.
[27:45.57]But why is he up there?
[27:48.29]Yeah, why is he up there?
[27:52.88]I was going to pause it again.
[27:53.78]No.
[27:54.12]No more pausing the... He's smiling at us.
[27:57.58]Deb!
[27:59.42]Get back where you belong!
[28:00.94]Deb!
[28:03.54]Whatever.
[28:04.92]We have to go through the tutorial first to figure out... Wait, I need these.
[28:08.34]Gather these.
[28:10.46]There's a lot of things over there.
[28:13.94]There's a lot of weird enemies.
[28:31.95]I love how this is pulling a Legend of Zelda and I'm a little kid right now.
[28:35.51]And I'm gonna grow up to be a big kid, right?
[28:41.83]Fifteen percent health added to the meta... What is he doing?
[28:45.10]Is he just screaming at them?
[28:48.56]I thought we were supposed to hunt them.
[28:51.86]Yeah, why did you do that?
[28:53.58]Okay.
[29:00.15]They're best approached by stealth.
[29:02.33]Don't worry.
[29:03.65]We'll catch up with them further down the valley.
[29:05.63]You'll see.
[29:11.79]Now, I want you to find some rocks that fit the top of your head.
[29:15.29]God damn it.
[29:15.69]What was I thinking?
[29:16.82]Do as I say, Aloy, and gather the rocks.
[29:19.48]I'm just getting a little bored.
[29:21.64]A little bit.
[29:22.24]It's okay.
[29:23.02]That's it.
[29:29.47]I'm assuming the rocks just throw them.
[29:33.26]Uh, guys, this is a game where I get to throw fucking rocks at people.
[29:36.50]You know those are my favorite games of all time, right?
[29:42.50]You give me a game where I get to willingly throw a rock at someone.
[29:46.52]Sure.
[29:50.87]Yeah, let's go.
[29:53.17]Follow him.
[29:54.13]Okay.
[29:56.63]You really left me behind there.
[30:01.94]I'm going as fast as I can.
[30:05.98]Sniper elite all over again.
[30:07.70]Alright, it's time to throw some rocks.
[30:10.78]Okay.
[30:26.30]The machines speak to each other, Aloy.
[30:28.58]Unless they are first silenced.
[30:30.66]Now you stay here on the bridge.
[30:32.40]On my signal, throw rocks and draw the watcher over.
[30:35.44]Throw rocks at me.
[30:37.42]On my signal, throw some rocks at me.
[30:39.64]Oh, Aloy.
[30:42.12]Where is he?
[30:46.87]Wait, what?
[30:48.13]Cancel.
[30:56.15]Should I keep throwing rocks at my dad?
[31:06.88]Alright, I did it dad.
[31:13.52]I threw a bunch of rocks at you.
[31:14.78]Oh shit.
[31:22.13]That thing broke all my... I broke every bone in the bottom.
[31:30.26]You'd think that you would... Wait, did it say I could pick him up?
[31:35.76]Oh, no.
[31:37.20]Do that.
[31:37.60]Alright, whatever.
[31:40.06]Take it.
[31:40.46]Take it all.
[31:41.72]Gather Ridgewood.
[31:54.69]They really are hammering home this whole pick stuff up off the ground thing, huh?
[32:02.20]So this... L1 to open the weapon wheel.
[32:06.58]You got it.
[32:08.08]Okay.
[32:09.16]To quick craft hunter arrows using R and press X. So I can make... Okay.
[32:15.36]20.
[32:15.82]Alright.
[32:17.92]That's 20.
[32:18.20]Alright.
[32:18.48]I finally get a weapon.
[32:19.79]I get my baby weapon.
[32:23.94]Let's put those arrows to use.
[32:25.88]Follow me.
[32:29.72]How long is the tutorial?
[32:30.76]It seems like it is fairly substantial.
[32:32.38]But, you know, I'm willing to deal.
[32:35.74]I'm willing to deal with it.
[32:38.14]Here.
[32:39.08]Stay low in the grass.
[32:40.64]And be quiet.
[32:41.84]I feel like this will work out.
[32:43.14]Alright, headshot.
[32:46.64]Shoot it right in its LED.
[32:49.20]It's time to make your first kill, Aloy.
[32:53.51]Nerf or nothing.
[32:55.09]It's nerf or nothing.
[32:57.43]It's crotch!
[32:57.99]Scan the Strider.
[32:59.11]Okay.
[32:59.25]Identify the Strider's weak points.
[33:23.26]I mean, right in his back?
[33:24.88]Weakness?
[33:31.87]Looks like it.
[33:33.79]Alright, so shoot the can on his back.
[33:37.33]Shoot the flaming can.
[33:38.39]And then right in the face.
[33:41.81]I did it, Dad.
[33:54.71]Lose the carcass.
[33:57.77]You did well today.
[33:59.25]But you have much to learn.
[34:02.03]But you must learn.
[34:02.69]Learn what?
[34:03.07]Everything.
[34:03.55]Oh, shit.
[34:04.57]Dad's leaving.
[34:25.89]Hey, Funky Berlin!
[34:28.93]Funky Berlin, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[34:32.13]Much appreciated, Funky.
[34:33.09]And they say, use these bits to take Kim out to a really nice dinner.
[34:37.67]My girlfriend and I have been having some time apart at the moment, and your videos and comedy have been helping me get through this and all to stay positive.
[34:44.21]Thanks, Jerma.
[34:44.74]Well, thanks, Funky.
[34:46.22]I will do that in your name, for sure.
[34:50.50]And hopefully, uh...
[34:53.24]Hopefully you and your girlfriend get things worked out.
[34:56.30]You're doing well.
[34:59.46]But thank you very much.
[35:00.32]I will absolutely do that.
[35:04.21]Oh shit.
[35:04.59]And then another $50 from KXZ.
[35:06.93]KXZ coming in again.
[35:07.99]This guy... I'm sorry.
[35:11.81]I paused that at the worst time.
[35:13.06]I was trying to say hi to somebody.
[35:16.53]But thank you, KX.
[35:17.21]They say, oh shit, Jerma time.
[35:18.41]Thank you, dude.
[35:19.91]Thank you so much for that.
[35:22.07]Fifty fucking dollars.
[35:23.05]You guys rock.
[35:26.63]Much love to both of you.
[35:28.03]Much love to all of you.
[35:28.83]Jesus.
[35:29.11]They're gonna kick him to death.
[35:30.95]That's a little morbid.
[35:31.59]So I'm just gonna shoot him in the waypoints.
[35:48.01]What's wrong with this guy?
[35:49.95]Dad, I have, like, fucking alien technology on my head.
[35:52.75]Stop lying and telling stories, child.
[35:54.85]Just use your bow and shoot randomly.
[36:02.88]No, don't do that!
[36:03.78]Ah, no!
[36:07.30]Oh, what do I do?
[36:07.96]I just gotta stay up here.
[36:11.25]My seven-year-old daughter went down there.
[36:13.19]I'm scared.
[36:14.17]No, easy.
[36:20.27]Wait, what?
[36:25.65]Sneak to the wounded boy.
[36:26.81]Okay.
[36:29.83]What is going on?
[36:32.58]Highlight target.
[36:34.20]Tag target.
[36:34.96]Highlight track.
[36:35.58]I can see where he's going to go.
[36:38.34]Okay.
[36:44.23]Wait for him to go down that way.
[36:45.63]He goes around the rock.
[36:49.41]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:52.42]Did somebody say cheer train?
[36:53.90]Well, thank you, megalomaniacal.
[36:55.66]Maniacal high lead.
[36:56.66]Thanks for the free bucks, dude.
[37:02.97]Should I just throw a rock over there?
[37:04.67]I feel like I could do that.
[37:07.55]We're going from grass to grass, right?
[37:10.99]That'd make the most sense.
[37:13.97]I am gonna take some of this Ridgewood.
[37:17.13]Alright, what else we got?
[37:17.75]Any more Watchers?
[37:20.55]That guy's back is turned.
[37:21.87]What else we got?
[37:22.43]This dumbass.
[37:24.15]There's a Watcher over there.
[37:27.47]I'm gonna tag that one and highlight his track to see where he's going.
[37:30.19]Oh, there's one right here.
[37:31.65]Okay.
[37:39.41]Yeah, please turn around.
[37:41.37]I just want to get to the boy Just run forget the stealth well, how will I ever learn?
[37:48.33]I gotta get the roses Alright, what happens if I do throw a rock let's just see what happens I Mean they kind of just go like huh?
[38:07.65]What was that noise?
[38:09.18]They do the Metal Gear Solid, except they're horses.
[38:13.86]Okay.
[38:14.32]Well, whatever.
[38:14.94]Uh, tag this target, highlight your track.
[38:23.33]Eh.
[38:24.33]I guess I have to wait another second here.
[38:25.67]Is there another thing of brush to go in over here?
[38:28.15]Not really.
[38:30.97]Oh!
[38:34.93]I can't really see.
[38:42.85]I think I can make it.
[38:43.69]Oh, they can hear, too, huh?
[38:49.67]What am I doing?
[38:53.22]I'm dead.
[38:53.70]Okay.
[38:55.30]Okay, alright.
[38:56.10]So, apparently, they can hear you.
[38:58.94]Dad didn't tell me that.
[39:02.82]Why didn't Dad tell me about that?
[39:06.05]I thought that they could just see me.
[39:07.55]They can hear me, too?
[39:10.29]Like, what the fuck's up with that dad?
[39:11.33]There he is.
[39:18.96]I really wish we could get off the screen.
[39:20.32]I know, like, what that means.
[39:22.03]Can't let them see me.
[39:25.34]Like, I know.
[39:26.08]Like, I, I, look.
[39:26.94]This, like, giant text on the screen would be nice if we got off.
[39:30.92]Dad did tell me that?
[39:31.76]He did not.
[39:32.30]He was just like, oh, yeah, let me tell you something.
[39:34.62]When you, uh, when you find yourself in a situation where you find the watchers, uh, they have an LED on their face.
[39:40.43]You shoot them in the back.
[39:43.11]And where the fuck is he now, by the way?
[39:45.43]Thanks a lot, Dad.
[39:49.25]You're of no help to me.
[39:50.97]Wait, what?
[39:56.97]Where's the boy over here?
[39:58.03]He's like right there.
[39:59.88]I think I'm alright.
[40:02.42]I thought that was going to be a lot funnier than it was.
[40:10.98]Never mind.
[40:15.76]Crouching is quieter?
[40:16.58]Yeah, I know.
[40:26.38]Thanks, Dad.
[40:27.00]Alright, now what am I doing?
[40:30.12]Am I bringing him back to lead the boy to safety?
[40:34.28]Okay.
[40:37.48]So, like, over here.
[40:41.48]We got any watchers?
[40:42.16]We got this guy.
[40:42.52]How do you know to avoid them?
[40:48.13]Is he actually going to follow me or is he not?
[40:49.71]He's going to be one of those idiot AIs that get stuck somewhere.
[40:55.02]Where's my stealth kill?
[41:01.79]What's the range on them being able to see, like, behind them?
[41:04.69]It's probably fairly large, I would assume, right?
[41:11.98]Oh, you're gonna stay there for a second?
[41:13.20]Please tell me you are.
[41:14.06]Come on.
[41:16.20]Come on!
[41:18.46]Come on, you sneak so much faster than a little girl, dude.
[41:21.00]Let's go.
[41:26.19]Alright, let's go.
[41:32.86]What?
[41:34.78]That transition didn't work.
[41:39.06]Thanks for nothing, Dad.
[41:42.65]I'm proud of you.
[41:44.43]Seven-year-old daughter.
[41:47.55]I'm a huge guy with a bow.
[41:50.55]I just let you do that.
[41:57.21]Wait.
[41:58.47]What?
[41:58.71]Mother, bless that girl.
[42:00.79]Bless you both.
[42:04.23]Boy!
[42:04.73]Save me.
[42:08.07]Here it comes.
[42:08.45]Boy!
[42:11.05]Seal your lips.
[42:12.41]There's the bad guy.
[42:15.11]They are outcasts, both.
[42:17.35]And she is motherless.
[42:19.95]Here it comes.
[42:23.29]Come now.
[42:25.09]Back to mother's heart.
[42:31.83]Hey That boy should not have spoken to us.
[42:38.29]It's against tribal law We'll go home now follow I know the way Alright like that this all like We're still going I still have to be little baby link
[43:02.46]Okay, I thought I was like a tiny person, and that was a fucking giant.
[43:07.08]I thought that was a giant, like we were little people in a tiny little mini tribe.
[43:14.05]Jesus.
[43:16.39]I thought that was the big twist of the tutorial, like we're tiny.
[43:27.37]Flashpoints offer moments of emotional choice.
[43:29.89]How Ally expresses her personality is up to you.
[43:33.93]Choose fist and Ally will confront the challenge directly.
[43:37.20]Choose brain and Ally will use her insight to find a clever, less obvious approach or choose love and... Ah!
[43:43.54]Okay, I'm assuming love is like you... Okay.
[43:46.76]Aim for his head, knock the rock out of his hand, or drop your rock.
[43:56.27]Okay.
[44:01.00]are we doing uh are we doing like evil are we doing an evil playthrough I will do evil playthrough if I want to aim for the brain throw the rock at his head aim for his brain here hold still I'll get it why
[44:30.77]Why am I an outcast?
[44:32.57]Aloy, this is not the time.
[44:35.71]Who was my mother?
[44:37.19]Aloy, I've told you before.
[44:39.41]That's not for us to know.
[44:40.55]You were just a newborn when the Matriarchs brought you to me.
[44:44.29]I feel like this whole thing could have been in one five-minute cutscene.
[44:48.67]It's not so simple.
[44:51.40]But they know.
[44:53.58]Aloy, we are outcasts.
[44:56.18]So how do I make them tell me?
[44:57.88]The Matriarchs?
[44:59.43]There is a way, perhaps.
[45:00.81]So tell me.
[45:01.54]It would be dangerous.
[45:04.14]How?
[45:05.46]It would take years of training.
[45:07.54]I don't care.
[45:10.12]How do I do it?
[45:12.06]Tell me.
[45:13.30]The proving.
[45:14.76]The tribes write a pass every year.
[45:17.24]Those who pass become braves.
[45:19.26]But to the one who wins, the matriarchs grant a boom.
[45:22.54]A boom?
[45:24.10]Yes.
[45:25.02]Whatever the winner wants.
[45:27.50]Then I'll do it.
[45:29.94]Stop being impatient.
[45:30.64]I know, I'm so impatient.
[45:32.30]This game's gonna be great.
[45:33.56]Don't worry.
[45:35.56]I'm certain this game is going to be, like, fantastic.
[45:37.76]Don't worry.
[45:38.14]I'm just saying.
[45:39.56]Just saying, like... Give me, like, a Kojima 10-minute cutscene in the very beginning, and let's go.
[45:54.88]But... Whoa, wait a minute.
[46:03.04]Oh, you're missing.
[46:04.70]Let's see the montage.
[46:06.24]Here comes the 80s montage of her failing a couple times.
[46:08.82]Oh, can she actually do it?
[46:10.18]Doesn't look like it.
[46:11.61]Oh, she's falling.
[46:12.75]Got my hands.
[46:13.61]I can do it.
[46:14.59]I'm gonna do it.
[46:15.49]Improving, going after a rabbit.
[46:17.01]Does she get the rabbit?
[46:18.03]She doesn't.
[46:18.87]Oh, damn it.
[46:19.47]I'll never improve, Dad.
[46:21.29]Wait a minute.
[46:23.43]She's got her real first test.
[46:24.69]It wasn't the rabbit after all.
[46:28.01]No, it was Dad.
[46:32.13]Don't worry.
[46:32.57]I love you.
[46:34.19]Let me do like a minority report while we brew a stew.
[46:37.51]Alright, that's good.
[46:42.59]That's enough training for one minute.
[46:45.15]When you wake up in another two minutes, you'll be ready.
[46:47.67]This is getting better.
[46:49.65]A little closer this time.
[46:51.19]Closer to the middle.
[46:52.09]Doing a good job this time.
[46:53.15]She's on the log.
[46:54.31]Not going to trip this time.
[46:55.33]I'm going to run across and I'm going to make it a dad.
[46:57.91]That's right.
[46:58.71]Oh, just barely.
[47:01.98]Oh, and he's going to put his hand down.
[47:03.26]Yeah, I knew it.
[47:03.90]Grab the hand.
[47:05.96]I knew you could.
[47:06.55]I don't even need the help.
[47:07.81]I don't even need the help, Dad.
[47:09.41]I'm ready.
[47:10.69]I'm ready.
[47:11.93]You are ready.
[47:13.19]You make me so proud.
[47:14.69]I didn't even need to put my hand down and grab you.
[47:17.77]She's making the second jump even without me helping.
[47:20.08]Oh, there she goes.
[47:26.20]Oh.
[47:28.97]Okay, she's still training she's been doing this every day for like 20 years Wow she's getting good.

[48:11.05]Wait, it's the same guy.
[48:12.39]He didn't even age.
[48:18.41]Hold on, he's like the same exact fucking guy.
[48:22.27]Did they not make a second character model for this guy?
[48:31.39]Dad apparently doesn't age.
[48:38.27]He's a little older.
[48:39.39]He's a little bit older.
[48:40.23]Alright, first of all, hold on.
[48:47.70]Let me pause this for one second.
[48:51.50]Some bits came in.
[48:53.28]Ophos gave 50 bucks.
[48:55.78]And he says, cheer train.
[48:58.15]Ofas, thank you for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[49:01.43]That's incredibly generous of you.
[49:02.47]Thank you.
[49:04.82]But thank you for the cheer train.
[49:07.48]Thank you also to Khalid, Megalomononical Khalid.
[49:10.40]Did someone say cheer train?
[49:13.02]Well, somebody did just say cheer train.
[49:16.42]But we don't have to do a cheer train.
[49:20.02]Somebody did say it previously.
[49:22.19]But thank you for the three bucks.
[49:23.37]And then Never Trust a Purple gave 50 bucks.
[49:26.89]5,000 bits from Never Trust a Purple.
[49:30.77]Saying, use these bits to take glue men out to a really shitty dinner.
[49:34.49]Like I'm talking awful.
[49:35.61]White Castle eat like 17 terrible burgers.
[49:38.22]I want you both in the hospital with food poisoning.

[50:10.62]Okay.
[50:10.76]Okay.
[50:12.74]Skills.
[50:14.16]Prowler, Brave, or Forager.
[50:17.61]Well, we have a Diablo II skill tree we have to think about here.
[50:20.23]Alright, Prowler.
[50:22.15]Silent Takedown.
[50:25.75]Time slows while aiming during a jump or slide.
[50:28.21]That's really fucking cool.
[50:30.15]That's so cool that I think I have to do that, but let's see.
[50:33.48]Silent Drop.
[50:36.60]Okay.
[50:38.98]Slowdown Time.
[50:40.70]Ugh.
[50:42.42]High damage attack on downed enemies.
[50:46.20]Light spear attacks have an increased chance to knock off armor and components.
[50:51.15]Well, let's do this one first.
[50:52.83]Like, that's just too cool.
[50:56.31]Right?
[50:58.43]Use ranged weapons while on a rope.
[51:03.91]What else is there?
[51:06.10]Lower an enemy.
[51:07.16]Speeds up healing from the medicine pouch.
[51:10.47]I feel like that's just a necessity, right?
[51:12.29]I mean, kind of.
[51:14.01]One more.
[51:16.41]And more resources.
[51:20.80]This too.
[51:21.80]I feel like this is a very useful thing to have.
[51:29.85]Double shot.
[51:30.85]That's triple shot.
[51:33.83]I may have made a mistake.
[51:35.83]Oh, well.
[51:37.49]Crafting to modify weapons.
[51:38.97]I guess I can do weapon mode.
[51:39.89]Whatever.
[51:40.19]Find rust.
[51:43.31]Hey, curly snail.
[51:44.01]Thank you for the $5.
[51:46.23]So R1 is to knock... Try it on a training dummy.
[51:49.12]You knock armor off?
[51:50.10]Okay.
[51:50.38]Interesting.
[51:52.20]Interesting.
[51:55.06]uh thanks for the five bucks though curly snail they say uh I heard cheer train oh god you did hear that you you just said it too so that's why you heard it but thank you made them soon enough he said we'd go hunting this morning why isn't he here where's he gone to so you can just jump in the air and it slows down that's so cool
[52:27.77]I fell for it.
[52:31.11]What's wrong with him?
[52:32.03]Dad, what are you doing?
[52:35.96]I was just looking at the sunset and imagining just how damn handsome I am and how I don't age.
[52:42.38]Wait, what?
[52:50.66]Is everything okay?
[52:51.80]We must speak.
[52:58.32]I've been thinking about your training, Aloy.
[53:01.16]You've learned to hunt, learned to survive.
[53:03.00]He's gonna ascend.
[53:03.92]But I fear there's a lesson I failed to teach you.
[53:08.74]Would you learn it now?
[53:10.53]Of course.
[53:11.53]I'll always learn what you have to teach.
[53:13.75]There has been some trouble recently.
[53:16.87]It affords an opportunity to learn this lesson.
[53:18.77]Evil, evil, evil.
[53:19.93]Oh yeah, it's supposed to be evil.
[53:21.43]You must come prepared, or you will die.
[53:26.61]Is the audio a little too low?
[53:29.17]This is Ashley Burch.
[53:29.79]Kind of sounds like her.
[53:50.06]Alright, is there something else?
[53:51.30]Anything else?
[53:51.92]I'll get the parts.
[53:53.66]Is anything else?
[53:55.58]Something else bothering you?
[53:58.19]I'll turn the audio up.
[54:04.59]Let's just go.
[54:05.44]The eyes look good in this game.
[54:06.38]The graphics are great.
[54:07.90]Especially just being on a default PlayStation 4.
[54:10.52]Hold on, let me do this.
[54:11.10]Oh shit, I was trying to pause it.
[54:11.96]Stream's going to cut off for one second.
[54:13.58]I'm going to put the volume up a little bit.
[54:15.00]I'm just going to increase the volume a tad.
[54:39.31]And are we back?
[54:40.59]Is the volume a little louder?
[54:42.86]Should be.
[54:43.28]Okay.
[54:44.46]We have to go on like a gathering mission.
[54:46.30]Trade for a trip cast.
[54:47.44]Gather Ridgewood.
[54:48.14]Gather... Oh, God.
[54:50.48]Gather metal shards from the machines.
[54:52.08]Alright, well.
[54:54.61]That was kind of cool.
[54:59.63]So we just have to talk to Karst and trade for a trip cast.
[55:04.70]Oh, boy.
[55:05.58]This is huge.
[55:06.46]Alright, so... Let's just go do that.
[55:09.30]Like, where was this?
[55:14.74]The points of interest are just all over the place.
[55:16.20]Alright, let's just go.
[55:16.80]Let's just see what we can do.
[55:17.96]I have some arrows.
[55:23.98]I've got... What is this?
[55:26.70]Discover a campfire by getting near it, which unlocks a new fast travel location.
[55:30.10]Okay.
[55:32.08]Here's bonfires.
[55:34.03]We need to get a bunch of Ridgewood.
[55:41.41]This is just a fetch quest.
[55:42.95]Gather Blaze from Striders.
[55:46.49]Okay.
[55:48.35]Thank you, Loony, for the five bucks.
[55:51.72]Appreciate it.
[55:53.88]Alright, Metal, we need to just kill machines and stuff.
[55:55.80]I guess we just need to go.
[55:59.74]That hurt.
[56:05.55]And trade for a Tripcaster.
[56:07.23]So, I mean, where is that?
[56:08.31]Is that guy all the way down here?
[56:10.83]Yeah.
[56:11.77]We just gotta go, right?
[56:14.16]So, there is a Dark Souls role.
[56:15.72]That's interesting to know.
[56:26.25]This is just a Warcraft quest.
[56:27.47]That's correct.
[56:38.52]I still need to look out for Ridgewood.
[56:42.56]I still have my Bluetooth.
[56:44.54]It had battery after all this time.
[56:53.61]Still no gameplay in like an hour.
[56:55.65]Well, this is like a heavily story tutorial first hour or two, right?
[57:03.70]Well, there's this.
[57:05.20]You do unlock mounts?
[57:06.14]Oh, that's cool.
[57:07.78]Another bonfire.
[57:08.64]Alright.
[57:12.44]Where are we off to?
[57:13.18]I mean, I guess... There's that.
[57:16.55]So I can hunt these things, I think.
[57:18.45]Alright.
[57:20.97]I have, like, my stealth kill.
[57:24.47]There's a lot of things here.
[57:25.87]It's R1, right?
[57:29.07]Those watchers...
[57:33.50]I wonder if I can stealth kill him.
[57:38.89]Pretty sure I can.
[57:40.21]Let's try it.
[57:40.69]Oh, there's that.
[57:46.29]Got ya.
[57:49.75]And let's search him.
[57:51.51]I think I was spotted.
[57:57.19]Kind of.
[58:00.44]Sort of spotted.
[58:01.56]I mean, he kind of looks like an idiot.
[58:04.18]That was easy enough, I guess.
[58:18.72]Those things are a lot easier than I thought they were going to be.
[58:23.59]I'll be honest.
[58:24.67]I thought those guys were going to be way, way more aggressive.
[58:30.03]But we're good.
[58:30.53]We got that.
[58:32.79]Now we just need some more Ridgewood.
[58:36.66]Keep going.
[58:39.28]Another Blaze from Striders.
[58:44.50]Oh, shit.
[58:49.96]What the fuck was that?
[58:50.96]Should have right in his ass.
[58:56.06]Okay, there's that.
[59:06.89]Blaze, here we go.
[59:07.92]Okay, the Dark Souls role is... Seems interesting, I guess.
[59:19.22]Dead time?
[59:20.50]No, I ain't gonna die.
[59:22.84]There's no way I'm gonna die.
[59:24.70]Why are there so many of them just gathered up here?
[59:28.74]Can I just do like five stealth kills?
[59:32.79]What is that?
[59:34.95]Watcher?
[59:37.01]Valuable resource detected.
[59:39.09]Wait, did I not pick that up?
[59:42.31]I guess.
[59:42.67]I don't know.
[59:43.86]What is...
[59:45.61]I guess it's a bunny rabbit.
[59:47.67]Medicine?
[59:48.01]I'll take one.
[59:52.05]Oh, I see.
[59:52.51]Okay, so I understand the medicine thing.
[59:55.03]So, up in the top left, that's like my medicine bar!
[60:03.90]Okay.
[60:05.28]Alright.
[60:06.44]Easy, buddy.
[60:07.00]I don't want to hit you in the face.
[60:13.00]Turn around.
[60:13.90]Okay.
[60:17.88]Can I?
[60:19.79]Now's my chance for what?
[60:22.83]Fuck it.
[60:30.61]Why are you... He took so many more hits.
[60:32.92]Oh, it's... I know why.
[60:33.58]I need to craft some more, uh... More stuff.
[60:37.30]Alright, I got what I needed.
[60:38.38]Let me craft some arrow.
[60:41.06]Hunter arrow.
[60:41.66]Let's get a couple of those.
[60:45.22]13 of them now.
[60:45.67]Alright, keep going.
[60:46.43]Just need more ridgewood.
[60:55.41]Ridgewood's just like anywhere, right?
[61:00.40]Oh, geez.
[61:00.78]Mr. Snake Man just gave $50.
[61:02.38]Your sneaking skills impressed me.
[61:03.80]Well, thank you, dude.
[61:04.64]Much appreciated.
[61:15.88]Hold on one second, guys.
[61:20.67]I'm gonna pee.
[61:21.65]I'll be back.
[61:22.51]Pee time.
[61:23.25]Pee break.
[61:24.33]My hour long, my hour plus long tutorial made me have to pee.
[61:27.30]I'll be right back.
[64:51.56]Alright.
[64:52.80]Thankfully I didn't die.
[64:56.13]I'm glad I wasn't dead, but... Oh!
[64:59.35]Alright.
[65:01.43]Gather more shit.
[65:02.51]Sure.
[65:04.63]But thank you so much, Mr. Sneakman.
[65:07.39]That was very generous of you.
[65:10.13]And then somebody gave another... What's with the 50-50-50s?
[65:14.15]Another 50 bucks from KXZ501.
[65:16.61]KX, damn, dude.
[65:19.65]Thank you so much.
[65:21.84]For the... What is going on?
[65:25.16]Who is this guy?
[65:26.90]Are these bad guys?
[65:30.65]That just very slightly irritated him.
[65:33.63]That made him get up from walking.
[65:34.99]Okay.
[65:37.79]Shit.
[65:40.85]No.
[65:41.12]Okay.
[65:41.48]Alright.
[65:43.60]I guess these aren't bad guys.
[65:50.85]Another campfire.
[65:51.63]Might as well use it.
[65:52.27]Wait, where is it?
[65:54.14]Campfire discovered.
[65:55.06]Where?
[65:59.26]I want to pull this camera back.
[66:02.52]I'm getting claustrophobic with this camera.
[66:04.48]I need more Ridgewood.
[66:06.90]Should I scan the area or something for Ridgewood?
[66:10.78]Isn't that shit just everywhere?
[66:11.76]How come I can't find it yet?
[66:17.20]Now I have the bad ending.
[66:20.53]Craft fire arrows.
[66:21.51]Give me... I need more fucking dumb wood.
[66:24.99]This isn't ridge wood.
[66:25.75]This is, like, wax root.
[66:27.83]This is ear wax.
[66:29.31]Sit at the campfire.
[66:30.11]I mean, I need, like, I need wood.
[66:37.54]Where's all the ridge wood?
[66:40.62]Where's the campfire?
[66:41.42]As he says, in front of the campfire.
[66:43.30]Is this just an optional mission?
[66:45.96]Can I just talk to this guy and say, who cares?
[66:57.95]You can actually hurt the animals.
[66:59.61]That's not fair.
[67:01.93]Why can't you hurt the animals and not the people?
[67:05.97]That FPS.
[67:08.49]Yeah, I guess this is optimized for a PS4 Pro.
[67:10.99]It's been running pretty stable, though, at like 30.
[67:12.53]That's what I've seen.
[67:14.97]So, a great Nora mother.
[67:18.63]Don't talk to me.
[67:21.96]Okay.
[67:22.66]Why can't you hurt people?
[67:23.50]You know what I mean?
[67:25.10]I should be able to fucking shove these people off.
[67:29.57]Let's just go talk to this guy.
[67:30.86]Whatever.
[67:31.16]30 FPS.
[67:44.27]This is 30 FPS on the PS4.
[67:47.21]Pretty stable as it drops to 20.
[67:48.51]Well, stable enough.
[67:50.07]Wait.
[67:50.45]Should I...
[68:01.29]No, I can't.
[68:02.31]I can't do it.
[68:03.67]How do I cancel?
[68:06.29]Medicine pouch full.
[68:08.95]Where is this guy's hut?
[68:09.81]Over here?
[68:11.95]Ridgewood?
[68:12.95]Yes.
[68:15.67]Thankfully, he picks up a ton.
[68:17.83]Here we go.
[68:23.16]Evil, right?
[68:25.24]This is the bad guy from before.
[68:28.08]Well, well, well.
[68:29.68]An outcast on my doorstep.
[68:31.50]I'll mother protect me.
[68:33.56]Surprised you saw me the way you keep looking every other direction to make sure no one's watching.
[68:38.28]Careful there, or you'll sprain your neck.
[68:40.44]It's always a pain in the neck when you show up, girl, one way or another.
[68:44.09]Hm.
[68:48.27]I mean, just trade.
[68:48.97]I don't want to hear this guy's fucking story.
[68:52.77]I don't want to hear this guy's life story.
[68:55.48]Whoa!
[68:57.44]Somebody just gave a hundred fucking bucks.
[68:59.42]What does this say?
[69:02.30]Hunter Normandy, thank you for the hundred dollars.
[69:04.74]Again.
[69:04.92]He's back.
[69:05.98]Dropping mad money again.
[69:06.74]Show me.
[69:11.59]Uh, Hunter, thank you so much, dude.
[69:15.29]They say, hey Jerma, take this hundro and treat Kim and yourself to something nice.
[69:20.52]Never stop smiling, you incredible dude, and thanks so much for all the laughs.
[69:23.04]You've helped me through, get through some tough stuff.
[69:25.66]Now with this hundred, I have a few demands.
[69:28.67]Mod Kyle, 24-hour dog stream, and clown car vlog.
[69:32.93]Well, I can guarantee...
[69:36.15]I can guarantee one of those things that you just said will happen.
[69:41.39]Guaranteed.
[69:42.17]Okay.
[69:42.65]Like, that's a guarantee.
[69:45.48]But, thank you for your incredibly generous bit donation, dude.
[69:49.72]100 bucks is a lot of fucking money.
[69:50.78]Thank you.
[69:52.66]So I need a trip caster now.
[69:55.90]Fetch quests.
[70:01.31]Uh... Trip caster.
[70:05.66]This weapon creates traps which detonate when the tripwire connecting two anchor points is broken.
[70:09.42]It is best used across enemy patrol paths or its narrow spaces.
[70:12.08]Yeah, yeah, it can be modified.
[70:13.14]Let's just get it.
[70:13.74]This is the quest is to get it and teach me how to use it.
[70:17.66]Put it here.
[70:18.52]Oh, okay.
[70:22.10]Sure thing.
[70:22.50]Yeah.
[70:22.66]Okay.
[70:22.78]Snort!
[70:33.22]Actually, can I buy branches from this guy?
[70:37.84]Can I buy wood from you?
[70:40.84]No.
[70:43.24]Alright.
[70:44.34]Free sample box.
[70:46.96]This free sample box is free.
[70:48.56]Are you serious?
[70:51.34]Hell yeah.
[70:51.70]Okay, goodbye.
[71:02.11]Alright.
[71:02.73]Alright.
[71:04.87]Tripcaster.
[71:05.63]Open the quest menu.
[71:08.05]Tutorial.
[71:08.53]Tripcaster.
[71:08.97]Level 8.
[71:09.31]You have acquired a powerful new weapon.
[71:11.32]The Tripcaster is capable of firing new ammunition types.
[71:13.18]This combat challenge will help you learn and... Okay.
[71:19.36]Fine.
[71:19.58]Inventory though.
[71:21.52]I want to see what that shit was.
[71:27.10]L1 and bring up the Tripcaster.
[71:30.93]Yep.
[71:32.19]Okay.
[71:33.33]But first, but first.
[71:34.29]Hold on, hold on.
[71:35.59]We need to open our fucking free box.
[71:37.13]Treasure box.
[71:39.71]Free sample box said metal vessel, fast travel pack, and detonating blast trap.
[71:45.89]Okay.
[71:46.93]Crafting, carry capacity.
[71:50.99]We're still in the tutorial.
[71:52.27]But it's alright.
[71:53.71]We have the trip caster.
[71:56.41]Select a default ammunition.
[71:57.36]Wait, what?
[72:00.93]Yeah, okay.
[72:02.11]Aim at the ground near an enemy and fire at two spots to place a shock wire.
[72:05.51]It will stun an enemy across the wire.
[72:07.19]Okay.
[72:09.73]Trip machines with shock wire.
[72:13.39]Sure.
[72:15.06]I can just do that anywhere.
[72:21.46]So it just makes like a trip line.
[72:23.10]Alright, so what's like the next quest?
[72:26.74]Do I have anything else to do?
[72:29.62]Well, here's this.
[72:31.12]I completed this thing.
[72:33.04]Updated main quest.
[72:33.80]Craft fire arrows.
[72:34.62]More shit to do.
[72:35.62]L1 weapon wheel.
[72:38.96]Select the fire thing using R and press and hold X. Okay, so fire arrows.
[72:42.74]I can do it.
[72:44.25]There we are.
[72:46.55]Now meet Ross.
[72:47.25]Alright, let me just... Get this figured out first, though.
[72:54.05]Okay, let's tripwire this guy.
[72:55.37]Okay, can I hide behind the tree?
[73:03.55]Let's get his path situated.
[73:06.11]I got to put it in front of his path.
[73:08.61]So, I mean, I'm going to assume... Is he going to hear this?
[73:14.10]Like, I don't understand.
[73:16.36]What did I just do?
[73:20.32]Anybody figuring this out?
[73:25.57]I need to be closer.
[73:26.49]I need to be closer.
[73:34.03]I guess I got him.
[73:35.87]I guess I got the guy.
[73:47.02]Okay, so now he'll run at me.
[73:51.95]I get it, okay.
[73:54.07]What is he doing?
[73:54.73]Come on, step on it.
[73:58.51]He just jumped over the damn thing.
[74:04.30]Can you please just walk over this?
[74:06.96]Just walk over to this thing.
[74:08.82]Are you smart enough to like, okay, yeah.
[74:10.56]You're obviously not that smart.
[74:23.23]Whatever.
[74:23.97]When I first started, somebody said the tutorial was three hours long.
[74:30.87]You need to shoot two waypoints, you're making both ends of tripwire.
[74:36.85]I thought I was supposed to do that, like bang and then bang, right?
[74:42.86]Since when the fuck did you do that shit?
[74:49.10]Okay.
[74:52.01]Swim faster.
[74:55.03]I got that guy.
[74:57.45]I need my other ammo.
[75:06.33]Well, I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[75:09.39]I wish this fucking text would get off the screen.
[75:11.82]Like, get off the fucking, get off of my screen.
[75:16.10]You swim, like, it's telling me to go for a swim.
[75:18.38]It's like, get the fuck out of here.
[75:22.78]I don't give a shit about, like, how to swim right now.
[75:24.78]Like, get off my screen.
[75:28.26]How you doing?
[75:28.68]If you go in the water and you swim.
[75:30.50]The swimming helps with stealth if you swim.
[75:33.18]Do you want like 15 point font right on your fucking face right now?
[75:36.52]Are you sure?
[75:37.04]Okay.
[75:46.39]Meet Ross at the gate.
[75:47.63]I think I have fast travel to there.
[75:52.13]I do.
[75:53.01]Right.
[75:55.87]How do I... How do I travel?
[76:00.03]Not available yet.
[76:00.89]Why not?
[76:06.26]It takes one fast travel pack to do that.
[76:12.32]I guess I don't have that yet.
[76:13.46]Okay, well.
[76:15.99]I'm kind of... I'm just going to see.
[76:17.37]What does this do?
[76:20.67]Stop blaming the game?
[76:21.63]I'm just... I kind of want to just turn off the tutorials.
[76:27.24]Like the ones that pop up on the screen.
[76:28.46]Because they always just annoy me.
[76:33.22]Let's go to the north gate.
[76:39.48]I'm going to prolong... I mean, I've just been going.
[76:43.42]I've just been going.
[76:44.69]It's just like a very, very, very long tutorial.
[76:49.03]Which it probably has to be because they're giving a ton of information, right?
[76:53.87]There's a lot of things to know.
[76:57.96]How would I know how to stealth swim?
[77:01.24]Um... It would pop up on the lo- like... Here's something that, like, video gamers, like, video... Hey, gamers, let's talk about this, right?
[77:10.14]Why can't it pop up?
[77:11.78]See where my feet are right now?
[77:14.63]Underneath that.
[77:16.35]Why can't, like, some of those tutorial messages be, like, a 12-point font, like, underneath where I'm running?
[77:22.03]Why does it have to be a huge brick in the center top part of my screen?
[77:26.55]So many games do that.
[77:27.59]Like, put it down in the bottom of the screen.
[77:31.47]They cover so much screen real estate that they end up making... It's like a distraction for you because it's covering, like, your whole fucking viewing angle.
[77:37.71]Alright, wait.
[77:41.23]Where is it?
[77:41.84]Right here?
[77:45.32]15 point is Game Breaker, but 12 point is Vaan.
[77:47.62]Not when it's, like, right in front of you.
[77:48.60]Not when it's on the front of your screen.
[77:51.40]It's, like, in a box.
[77:54.88]They box that shit up.
[77:57.88]Why is it telling me to go this way?
[78:03.24]That's where the subtitles go?
[78:04.26]Yeah, but nobody... The subtitles for the robots?
[78:08.84]Mother's heart.
[78:12.26]Alright, what is going on with this thing?
[78:19.46]What do you mean, spotted?
[78:25.87]Spotted by what?
[78:28.37]Spotted by you, apparently.
[78:31.36]Apparently, I was spotted by you.
[78:33.70]Okay.
[78:34.70]Well, easy enough.
[78:37.46]Apparently, there's another one.
[78:43.07]Okay, that's how you activate that shit.
[78:44.61]There's a whole shitload of people coming over here now.
[78:50.47]They just jump in the air.
[79:03.43]Just get the slow-mo.
[79:06.41]That's so awesome.
[79:07.41]I can just activate the slow-mo by jumping in the air.
[79:09.89]That's great.
[79:11.93]Where the fuck are you people even coming from?
[79:22.11]I don't have any ammo.
[79:23.13]Okay, well, I'm going to have to hit you with a spear.
[79:28.80]Killed.
[79:32.01]Alright, can I hide for a second?
[79:34.83]We're good.
[79:35.11]Alright.
[79:38.13]I have plenty of shit to craft.
[79:41.39]Let's go.
[79:46.85]Rock?
[79:47.20]I have too many rocks.
[79:48.16]Keep going this way.
[79:51.26]Will I do anything but use slow-mo?
[79:56.83]Now that I think about it, you're right, yeah.
[79:58.77]Okay, R2 does like a big swing.
[80:02.61]The tutorial didn't tell me that one.
[80:07.31]Alright, let's just go.
[80:07.91]Let's get this tutorial out of the way so we can fight the big scary bosses.
[80:18.88]Any game with a lot of information makes me whiny and salty.
[80:21.58]What?
[80:21.82]I'm fine, right?
[80:22.74]I'm having... This game's good.
[80:26.79]I like this game.
[80:31.89]The only thing that annoys me about games like this is just how long it takes for them to tell you things.
[80:40.08]But this is going to be a good game.
[80:45.79]You have the firearms.
[80:47.70]I do.
[80:49.08]Those explosions and shouts beyond the embrace, is that the trouble you were talking about?
[80:54.10]Don't defend yourself.
[80:54.86]You will know soon enough.
[80:56.14]Until then, we wait for dark.
[80:58.68]Wait for dark?
[81:02.16]I have that thing you wanted.
[81:03.10]I saw Karst and got that trip caster I was talking about.
[81:06.11]Life is just one big tutorial.
[81:11.39]It wasn't cheap, but the caster is worth it.
[81:14.15]Perhaps.
[81:15.83]You'll know it's worth soon enough.
[81:20.65]Okay, bye.
[81:22.21]Okay, so go to bed.
[81:42.96]You wouldn't bother me if I was being whiny.
[81:44.60]Tutorials suck and long cutscenes that stop gameplay are annoying.
[81:48.55]Yeah, I mean...
[81:51.50]See, I know that there's a connection, right?
[81:53.80]There's a disconnect for me between when games want to be taken seriously as a narrative and be a video game at the same time.
[82:01.95]Some people like that shit.
[82:04.31]Some people think it's great, but I think if a game wants to be a movie, just make a fucking movie.
[82:10.58]And if a game wants to be a game, just make a fucking game.
[82:14.94]And now no one's talking.
[82:20.59]We've lost the audio for the actors.
[82:22.25]There it is.
[82:24.56]These are the true wilds, Aloy.
[82:25.38]With threats unlike any you have ever faced.
[82:40.74]And games that start... It's alright.
[82:43.49]Sometimes games have huge, huge narratives.
[82:46.79]And that's fine.
[82:48.35]But when a game... I'm not saying this is that game.
[82:52.21]I'm not saying that at all.
[82:55.41]This is not me saying that this is this game that I'm talking about.
[82:58.03]But a lot of games do this where...
[82:59.97]The game isn't really actually there.
[83:02.36]It's not really a game.
[83:04.12]They're just like making this interactive story where sometimes you like play a video game that's really not that substantial.
[83:10.91]A lot of games do that.
[83:13.14]Where it's just a huge bunch of cutscenes and dialog and there's not really a video game there.
[83:18.58]That's okay.
[83:18.98]That's like interactive media.
[83:20.13]But I'm not like really into like interactive media like that.
[83:24.15]I like being able to decide what I want to do.
[83:26.63]Not necessarily like have a story play out for me.
[83:29.74]And I don't like being taken out of what I'm doing.
[83:32.66]And a lot of games do that.
[83:42.13]But, alright.
[83:42.87]Follow the path of destruction.
[83:47.63]This game doesn't do that.
[83:49.83]Oh, and I am absolutely not saying that this is one of those games.
[83:53.31]I'm just stating in a personal opinion that I have about games that have very, very strong, large narratives in their games.
[84:01.67]Sometimes it's the only focus, and sometimes it's the focus to a point where it's not fun for me.
[84:07.18]Oh, shit.
[84:09.86]Did I get it?
[84:13.31]Alright, let's sneak around here.
[84:14.50]I feel like this is going to be the first real test of the game here.
[84:18.62]Possibly.
[84:28.78]See, I'm more into fun, interesting gameplay than I am of very interesting, good storylines in games.
[84:36.73]I just got angry and smashed.
[84:38.33]Okay, highlight this guy.
[84:40.61]Where's he going?
[84:45.17]I mean, I don't have any chai craft, right?
[84:49.53]I have enough to... I don't even think it's necessary.
[84:53.43]Honestly, I don't.
[84:54.65]Let's go buy him.
[84:59.57]Unless they really want me to trap this guy, which they might.
[85:02.42]Because it is the tutorial, but I don't think so.
[85:04.40]Just go.
[85:06.00]I don't want to wait for another cycle.
[85:07.58]Just go, please.
[85:09.70]Okay, good.
[85:11.70]Alright, pick up the wax.
[85:12.76]Wax.
[85:16.23]Is there a game where a storyline was so good that I could look past the subpar gameplay?
[85:24.39]I don't know.
[85:24.81]I don't know.
[85:25.83]Because I don't... I don't want to make a broad statement and say a game that I'm not sure of.
[85:31.04]I'd have to really think about that.
[85:33.66]But not for a very... Maybe like... Maybe like BioShock Infinite.
[85:41.94]Like, BioShock Infinite's gameplay was pretty standard.
[85:45.87]It was just, like, shoot the room full of people.
[85:50.19]It was good, but, like, I was so interested in what was going to happen next in that story that I kind of didn't really give a shit about the actual gameplay.
[85:59.58]The gameplay was just, like, to me to get to the next part where I could see what was going to happen.
[86:03.92]So, I'd probably say BioShock Infinite.
[86:10.97]Or like, you know, stuff like... I haven't played through all of The Last of Us.
[86:22.84]Undertale is another one.
[86:23.84]Undertale, definitely.
[86:27.52]Undertale was just like... The gameplay was... I mean, the battles were fun and interesting.
[86:31.56]The gameplay was fun in Undertale.
[86:32.70]What?
[86:35.10]But Undertale's narrative was way more interesting for me.
[86:38.54]Have I ever... Would I... Would or have I ever played Bloodborne?
[86:51.76]Bloodborne is one of my favorite games ever made.
[86:55.47]In fact, I would say it's probably up there as my favorite single-player game ever made.
[86:59.87]At this point, yes.
[87:07.36]Alright, let's kill this thing.
[87:09.62]Infinite sucked.
[87:10.26]I liked the setting of Infinite.
[87:12.76]Infinite was a very interesting setting.
[87:14.30]Wait, what?
[87:36.58]Alright, let's see.
[87:37.10]I need to... I need to investigate something for a second here, obviously.
[87:41.31]I'm not going to fight this thing.
[87:42.33]This thing is huge, by the way.
[87:43.63]Okay, highlight this thing.
[87:45.27]Where is he going to walk?
[87:46.19]So we'll wait until he comes around.
[87:47.79]We'll wait for the sawtooth to go out there.
[87:50.47]I'll put the trap right there.
[87:53.31]And we will see.
[87:53.87]We can kill this big fucking thing.
[87:55.13]Okay.
[88:04.06]Am I close enough to do this?
[88:04.94]I don't think so.
[88:05.44]Probably not.
[88:07.63]See if I'm close enough.
[88:09.85]No, I gotta be closer.
[88:10.71]Okay, well there's that.
[88:23.16]Should I use the fire arrows?
[88:24.04]I mean, it didn't tell me to, but I might as well try them.
[88:31.36]Super Mario Bros.
[88:32.18]2 is the greatest game?
[88:34.82]Well, I mean, that's every year, though.
[88:41.70]Where is he right now?
[88:43.74]Should I do more than one of these?
[88:45.22]I feel like I just should.
[88:46.30]Just put more than one down.
[88:48.54]Might as well, right?
[88:49.86]Like, where the fuck?
[88:50.98]Might as well.
[88:53.36]I'll run him across both.
[88:54.40]Alright, come on over here, dude.
[89:02.90]Body weakness is fire.
[89:04.10]Okay.
[89:06.26]So where is his actual weave?
[89:07.16]Right in his stomach?
[89:08.06]Alright, I'm gonna hit him right in the tummy.
[89:10.97]Right in his tummy.
[89:12.93]Let's see if he shows me his tummy.
[89:19.37]Alright, here he comes.
[89:21.99]Here he comes.
[89:25.15]No, he like smelt something over there on the right.
[89:30.33]Come on.
[89:32.25]Come on.
[89:34.15]Come on.
[89:36.39]And shock him.
[89:39.35]Wow, okay, holy shit Wow Wow he hurts a lot holy shit
[90:05.85]Oh, he just threw me in the fire.
[90:08.63]Fuck.
[90:13.29]I'm running away.
[90:13.79]I ain't gonna get fucking killed here.
[90:15.67]Oh, he's in the trap.
[90:18.42]Shit.
[90:18.84]I didn't know he got in the other trap.
[90:21.72]Can I just hit him?
[90:22.74]I'm gonna hit him.
[90:24.92]Get the fucking armor off him.
[90:27.24]If I can a little, right?
[90:38.63]This thing doesn't hurt me that much.
[90:39.91]Maybe it's barely.
[90:40.69]Have I ever played Heavy Rain?
[90:50.05]I actually have not, but I haven't played it because I already know how the ending goes.
[90:53.49]Let's trap him again.
[91:01.91]Ooh, that hurts!
[91:06.12]I should aim for the time he shoots his back.
[91:07.55]I don't really have an opportunity to shoot him in the stomach though.
[91:10.45]Unfortunately.
[91:11.01]Holy fuck, I'm getting destroyed right now.
[91:22.47]Come on, kill him.
[91:39.71]Jason!
[91:40.77]What the fuck, Jason?
[91:43.20]Come on, charge at me again.
[91:52.30]Hey, he's dead.
[91:52.96]Okay, got him.
[91:55.77]Alright, he's dead.
[91:56.85]That was fairly difficult.
[91:58.09]I ain't gonna lie.
[92:00.23]I wanted to shoot him in the tummy, but I didn't have a chance to.
[92:02.93]He wasn't showing me his tummy.
[92:07.45]Salty the heart your business chill water blaze and wire, okay, I Did it dad Why did I bring you here not to answer questions I
[92:22.54]Thank you, PurpleRoseTattoo, for the 500 bits.
[92:27.30]Jerma talks about narrative in games and doesn't even mention the best game story ever told.
[92:31.56]Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures.
[92:36.64]That is, like, one of the greatest narratives.
[92:39.48]I did when I shocked him.
[92:40.34]Was there a point to shoot him when I shocked him?
[92:43.08]Oh, well.
[92:43.48]These are Nora hunting lands.
[92:45.98]They must be protected.
[92:47.82]If you hadn't destroyed the Sawtooth, how many Braves might it have killed or injured tomorrow?
[92:52.52]Did I like the single-player story of GTA IV?
[92:55.04]Yeah.
[92:56.08]I like the single-player of all the GTA games.
[92:58.00]They're great.
[92:58.34]Yeah, I thought the same thing about the Miss Pauline.
[93:01.68]I think this might be Ashley Burch as the voice actress.
[93:04.20]Sounds a lot like her.
[93:05.28]I could be wrong, but it does sound like her.
[93:09.66]Yeah.
[93:24.17]That is the lesson you must learn.
[93:26.35]And remember it.
[93:28.03]After the proving.
[93:29.14]You wish I voice acted Rust?
[93:31.54]Skip?
[93:32.38]I can't though.
[93:34.06]People want to see.
[93:35.94]Somebody just said in all caps, shut up.
[93:37.58]I'm trying to like... Well, that's what we do here.
[93:39.72]We don't like watch cutscenes.
[93:40.86]We like talk over the cutscenes.
[93:42.18]We talk over the movie.
[93:49.41]Dawn has passed.
[93:51.93]This will be your last day in the Embrace as an outcast.
[93:55.23]Use the time to set your mind on the challenges before you.
[93:59.63]When it is time for you to go to Mother's Heart... He's just setting himself up to die.
[94:02.92]He really is.
[94:06.90]Alright, see you there, Dad.
[94:08.50]Bye.
[94:14.57]Okay.
[94:16.27]Obtained a generous reward box.
[94:20.48]You got some skill points too.
[94:21.70]Oh, reward box.
[94:23.34]What's this?
[94:24.26]Metal shards, blaze, metal vessel, fast travel pack, and health potion.
[94:29.54]Health potion, okay.
[94:34.11]Doubles the capacity of the medicine pouch.
[94:35.73]I think I really want this.
[94:37.69]Yeah, I do.
[94:40.05]I do.
[94:42.45]That's going to be very, very handy at some point later, right?
[94:44.97]Okay.
[94:47.33]Okay.
[94:50.60]So, let's pick up some shit.
[94:57.71]Save it.
[95:01.95]Click save.
[95:07.85]Excuse me, I'm going to go pick up some groceries.
[95:11.25]Talk to Rost.
[95:12.15]I just have to talk to Rost.
[95:14.01]He's all the way over here.
[95:14.71]Do I have a fast travel over here or anything?
[95:18.49]I do, don't I?
[95:19.37]Yeah, I do.
[95:19.89]Fast travel.
[95:21.97]It takes two travel packs.
[95:24.29]Wait, hold on a second.
[95:24.87]You're telling me it takes two travel burritos to go here?
[95:30.07]I don't think I want to do that.
[95:32.34]But I kind of do.
[95:33.76]But then again, I kind of don't because I need resources.
[95:35.64]And what is this Strider site?
[95:39.68]Um...
[95:43.67]Whatever, fuck it.
[95:44.71]Let's get to the end of the tutorial for crying out loud.
[95:47.57]This is still the tutorial.
[96:02.05]Ross gets a bad rap.
[96:06.50]Yeah, you know, that guy Ross, he gets a real bad rap, you know?
[96:13.75]Pay to win travel burrito currency.
[96:17.07]Let me turn around and go this way.
[96:24.50]I feel like I need... Just seriously, what am I doing?
[96:31.57]I wanna fill up on my health meter thing.
[96:39.98]Let's do some collecting.
[96:40.91]Let's just explore a little.
[96:42.49]Because I feel like this is going to be a big thing here.
[96:46.27]This is where Dad's going to die.
[96:52.49]He's going to get hit by a spear in the back.
[96:55.29]And he's going to go, No!
[96:59.27]I've taught you all I can, my dear.
[97:01.62]And the bad guy's going to be like, Yeah, you actually weren't ready.
[97:06.74]There's so much more for you to know.
[97:09.37]Let me teach you!
[97:10.27]And then they can do a montage of the bad guy teaching us.
[97:14.97]And then it's just a bad guy game from then on out.
[97:18.17]We're the bad guy.
[97:31.08]Have I ever played Castle of Griffinsteed before?
[97:33.52]Kielwood wants to ask.
[97:34.70]Um...
[97:36.42]I have.
[97:37.28]I've played through that whole game.
[97:39.32]And, man, was it great.
[97:41.20]Like, we're talking about, like, game of the century material, you know?
[97:46.63]I have full health.
[97:49.45]I think that's okay.
[97:50.93]I want... I want more, but... Can I make... in my crafting menu?
[98:03.66]Not really.
[98:04.32]When did I learn how to make healing potions?
[98:07.20]When I have healing, can I learn how to make those?
[98:15.04]Whatever.
[98:16.63]Look, if I have to fight a bunch of people because Dad gets attacked or something, who cares?
[98:19.79]I have health potions.
[98:28.90]This will come in useful.
[98:39.83]I feel like those healing herbs are very few far in between.
[98:44.43]What's my opinion on the Nintendo Switch?
[98:45.91]I don't have an opinion because I haven't played it.
[98:48.03]I do not own a Switch.
[98:49.66]I don't know anything.
[98:51.06]I don't know a damn thing.
[98:52.48]I don't know anything.
[98:53.14]Yeah, let's go.
[98:53.70]You've never been so close before.
[99:06.60]Just buy more money.
[99:08.88]Okay.
[99:09.10]Bye.
[99:09.28]I feel so bad skipping this shit, you know what I mean?
[99:12.52]Come on, when does he get hit with an arrow?
[99:34.28]Come on.
[99:35.74]Hey, take one of my teeth.
[99:37.22]Why are you talking like we'll never see each other?
[99:39.02]That's my back tooth.
[99:40.16]That's my best tooth.
[99:41.02]I chew up bones with that one.
[99:42.74]No.
[99:43.39]You should be with the tribe.
[99:45.95]And I will always be an outcast.
[99:47.67]No.
[99:47.79]But I told you I have that figured out.
[99:49.99]I'll come to you in secret.
[99:51.43]My child.
[99:52.21]I'll be the one breaking the law.
[99:53.77]Not you.
[99:54.67]You don't even have to talk to me.
[99:55.83]My child.
[99:56.87]This attachment to me will only hold you back.
[100:01.21]It is my wish that you embrace the tribe.
[100:05.12]You've lived in isolation for long enough.
[100:09.54]For your sake, I must go where you will never find me.
[100:15.12]This is goodbye.
[100:16.54]This is goodbye.
[100:19.56]Okay, if I'm an actor, I don't do that long of a pause.
[100:24.38]Good riddance, motherfucker!
[100:25.46]We're doing it again!
[100:35.41]...leaved.
[100:35.81]I threw away his tooth!
[100:39.53]War.
[100:39.69]War never changes.
[101:03.76]She picked it up anyways.
[101:12.01]Where'd he go?
[101:15.65]What the fuck, Jerram?
[101:16.75]I told you we were doing an evil playthrough.
[101:19.97]And the two dudes that sit at the gate, I have to answer their three questions.
[101:23.89]Do I have to kill these guys?
[101:33.08]I choose blood.
[101:34.88]She called them idiots.
[101:35.86]Alright, we're redoing her voice.
[101:38.28]Give me one second.
[101:39.28]I don't think I... Hold on.
[101:41.42]No, okay.
[101:41.88]I'm gonna do the acting here, guys.
[102:12.59]What is this place?
[102:14.45]This, a century ago, was a place for mourning back in the day.
[102:20.00]Back in the day?
[102:20.66]What does that mean?
[102:21.64]It means, child, that back in the day we used to burn our livestock and then eat them.
[102:27.20]It was disgusting.
[102:28.44]Disgusting?
[102:29.59]Yes, it was disgusting.
[102:30.81]But follow me.
[102:34.27]Are you thirsty at all?
[102:35.95]Do you want something to drink?
[102:37.05]Because before you do this, you need to have a... I'm not thirsty at all.
[102:40.31]I want to fight for my land.
[102:41.80]Yes, you do.
[102:42.34]You want to fight for your land.
[102:44.28]That's what we all do here.
[102:45.86]Huh.
[102:47.18]My God, what a pitch.
[102:48.66]Okay.
[103:02.86]Okay, okay, talk to your old friend.
[103:05.54]No.
[103:05.82]I don't want to do this the whole time.
[103:07.32]That's this sucks.
[103:09.48]Oh Alright fine hold on Hey, it's you wow you made it.
[103:13.86]I'm so glad you got here in time for the trial oh
[103:17.31]What happened to you?
[103:18.53]You didn't age at all since the last time I saw you.
[103:21.41]Yeah, it's a funny thing about video games.
[103:23.53]Sometimes they don't age anybody but the main character.
[103:25.77]It's weird.
[103:26.67]But hey, anyways, are you ready for your trial?
[103:29.82]I'm so excited for you.
[103:31.28]I can't wait to see what you're capable of.
[103:33.14]I'm capable of everything.
[103:34.30]My father taught me everything I need to know.
[103:36.28]Yeah, that's great.
[103:36.80]He was a real dick.
[103:37.58]I saw what you did out there with the tooth.
[103:39.28]I would have done that too.
[103:40.57]Super fucking crazy of you.
[103:42.33]You're a crazy girl.
[103:44.27]Hey, look, uh, but hey!
[103:45.67]Did I show you my hands yet?
[103:46.67]These are big hands, huh?
[103:47.81]And I got big arms, too.
[103:49.06]You wanna see how much I can bench press?
[103:50.60]200 pounds.
[103:51.32]Easy.
[103:51.94]No, no question.
[103:53.52]Yeah, so anyways, um, do you wanna smoke some weed?
[103:56.35]What?
[104:00.06]I don't smoke weed.
[104:01.58]Ah, that's too bad.
[104:02.82]It'll really calm you down for the event coming up.
[104:05.11]So, do you want to buy something?
[104:06.25]Or do you want to trade something?
[104:07.71]Or... Hey!
[104:10.67]I was right!
[104:12.75]I was correct.
[104:13.37]He did want to buy and trade.
[104:14.51]He was a trader.
[104:16.77]He was a trader.
[104:17.55]I don't know what I'm supposed to buy, though.
[104:24.03]I don't know what to buy.
[104:25.09]What should I buy?
[104:25.91]Turn the subtitles back on?
[104:36.79]How was I supposed to know?
[104:38.01]Alright, um, should I buy one of these?
[104:39.73]So this is what I'm wearing now.
[104:46.72]Rigged for endurance and protection against all the elements.
[104:49.02]The armor is well tested against the extremes of the sacred land.
[104:53.94]I don't know what wrench and screws mean.
[104:55.76]45 wrenches and screws.
[105:01.31]Hey, thank you, Metallion.
[105:04.42]Thank you for the, like, 40 bucks for $43.
[105:07.58]Save.
[105:08.58]My face hurts.
[105:09.24]Well, thank you so much, dude.
[105:10.36]I appreciate it.
[105:12.04]Thank you for the $40.
[105:14.48]Um, I can afford one of these.
[105:16.41]And I don't know which one of these do I want.
[105:17.99]Do I want this, which, 45% screws?
[105:18.89]65% screws?
[105:19.31]Makes her harder to see.
[105:33.31]The first one is free.
[105:35.51]Okay, well.
[105:36.85]It can be traded for... Okay, I don't know.
[105:39.01]Which one should I get?
[105:39.65]I feel like this one's the heaviest.
[105:53.22]I'm going to do this one.
[105:56.02]Let's do this one.
[105:57.12]Ignore survivor light.
[105:57.86]We're just going to do light armor.
[106:00.41]Let's do it.
[106:01.65]I'm buying it.
[106:03.35]Equip.
[106:04.79]Equip.
[106:05.75]Okay.
[106:08.26]Treasure boxes.
[106:08.98]Free sample box.
[106:09.76]Always take a free box.
[106:10.78]Why not?
[106:11.38]Every time.
[106:11.76]Hey, thanks for the supplies.
[106:15.36]Hold on.
[106:15.62]I've got to... Okay, hold on.
[106:21.03]Hey, that was great working with you.
[106:23.37]Thanks for the money.
[106:24.63]You need anything else?
[106:27.10]No, I don't need anything else.
[106:28.80]Hey, are you sure you don't need anything else?
[106:30.54]I'm gonna put you back in that menu.
[106:31.88]Are you cool with that?
[106:33.18]You cool?
[106:34.20]You're going... Hey, I know you wanted to leave the menu, but I mean, are you sure you don't want something else?
[106:41.07]Check the menu again.
[106:42.95]Take a close look.
[106:43.93]I don't want anything else.
[106:45.13]Back.
[106:46.03]Hey, listen.
[106:47.51]You have to buy something again.
[106:48.63]You probably bought the wrong thing.
[106:49.63]You want to go back in the menu?
[106:50.75]Check it out.
[106:52.23]Get me the fuck out of here.
[106:55.69]I'm stuck here forever.
[106:58.46]I'm stuck in this forever.
[107:04.17]I did buy something.
[107:05.01]I bought this.
[107:06.03]I just bought this.
[107:09.91]Oh, this is a quest item.
[107:11.24]I don't want to even equip this shit.
[107:14.02]Equip later.
[107:17.78]Hey, thanks for doing our pre-rendered, pre-recorded quest to buy something.
[107:21.95]Yeah, I know.
[107:22.51]I didn't even equip it.
[107:23.29]I'm wearing something completely different, but thank you nonetheless.
[107:26.74]Did you just burp or something?
[107:27.60]You just like glitched out for a second.
[107:28.82]You okay?
[107:29.18]You need some Tums?
[107:30.42]I got those too.
[107:31.82]Those are for free.
[107:32.77]No, not for free.
[107:34.07]You gotta give me like 200 Jerma Bucks for that.
[107:36.53]Why would we work in that currency?
[107:37.85]I don't know.
[107:38.47]It's weird.
[107:39.35]Anyways, good luck on your journey.
[107:40.47]Hey, go that way if you want to go to the journey that I was talking about over there.
[107:45.13]Yeah, by the way.
[107:46.82]Good luck.
[107:47.24]Remember when you saved me back in that village?
[107:50.96]We don't talk about that, but yes, I do remember.
[107:52.78]I saved your life.
[107:53.98]Yeah, I remember.
[107:55.22]Thank you for doing that.
[107:57.02]You know, I might be in love with you, actually.
[107:58.95]Should I tell you that now or later?
[108:00.69]Well, I just told you right now, so, you know, I just did.
[108:03.65]But maybe afterwards we can get a drink.
[108:06.39]Or something.
[108:06.79]I don't know.
[108:07.11]I'm not sure.
[108:07.53]Okay, bye.
[108:09.29]Alright, go to the lodge.
[108:18.12]Why am I still doing this?
[108:19.24]I don't fucking know.
[108:20.88]Why still do anything?
[108:21.76]What am I doing?
[108:28.04]Why am I casting a spell at the fire?
[108:31.76]Okay, well, why do I have to, like, pretend to interact like Hitman?
[108:39.39]Alright, we're doing this one on one more cutscene, and then I'm putting subtitles and audio back on.
[108:45.41]Yeah.
[108:47.73]Alright, here we go.
[108:48.63]This will be good.
[108:51.15]What's going on over here?
[108:52.05]What's happening here?
[108:56.25]People of our mother's heart, listen closely.
[109:01.84]No, no, no, listen to me instead.
[109:03.60]I'm the one that is supposed to be talking now.
[109:05.44]I'm Teresa.
[109:06.22]I'm the main character of this particular storyline.
[109:09.00]Now listen.
[109:10.10]A hero's journey starts here, with this man.
[109:17.71]That's right.
[109:18.75]It starts with me.
[109:20.03]And I'm going to read from this diplomatic document.
[109:23.17]All those who decide to enter the trial of champion... Fuck you!
[109:27.04]Throw rocks at him!
[109:28.10]Hey, hey, excuse me!
[109:29.62]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, hey, hold on a second.
[109:31.86]Everybody calm down.
[109:32.96]Let me talk now.
[109:33.90]I'm the fourth person to talk.
[109:35.36]I'm the fourth person in line to speak.
[109:37.46]But if you're going to try to do this, be aware of one very important thing.
[109:43.20]Those tomatoes are rotten.
[109:45.20]And I sold them to you.
[109:47.15]But as a person of interest in this story and as one earring in my ear, I am saying to you, be easy, be kind to each other, and take care of your young.
[110:00.85]That's what's the most important of all.
[110:03.83]Yeah, he's right.
[110:04.42]Yeah, he's correct.
[110:05.56]Yeah, I'm going to eat this tomato with my baby.
[110:07.88]You should eat that tomato with your baby and not deliver it to your son.
[110:10.90]I'm crying out loud.
[110:12.34]There's no reason for this.
[110:14.37]Yeah.
[110:16.49]And then look at this guy, for instance.
[110:17.91]He's in a red robe.
[110:19.47]How ugly does that look?
[110:20.51]You won't trust what he says.
[110:21.55]Trust what I say.
[110:23.05]Because what I say matters.
[110:25.90]And what matters to you matters to me, and we... Yeah, go ahead.
[110:33.88]I'll be reading from the document again, because he just went off on a wild tangent.
[110:37.79]I don't know what the fuck he was even saying, but... Don't start taking phone calls during this...
[110:43.13]Don't put that phone down, ma'am.
[110:44.64]Ma'am, you're not supposed to be on a cell phone.
[110:47.82]What do you think this is, a movie theater?
[110:49.20]You aren't watching up.
[110:51.74]What's going on here?
[110:53.34]I need to fucking focus on this guy.
[110:54.76]This guy's got some kind of brain matter that I need to see.
[110:56.94]There's an unknown device here.
[110:59.00]Who is this?
[111:03.91]What's going on with your brain?
[111:05.03]You got something in there, man.
[111:05.97]You should probably get that checked out by a doctor.
[111:08.63]I don't need a doctor.
[111:09.97]I've got an ear implant.
[111:12.10]It doesn't do much.
[111:13.52]It just makes me able to hear much better.
[111:15.82]You can hear me from a mic.
[111:17.96]Well, but still, though.
[111:19.62]Yes, still.
[111:21.06]But it looks cool, doesn't it?
[111:23.48]Looks cooler than yours, actually.
[111:26.54]Ow!
[111:27.56]What's wrong?
[111:27.92]What happened?
[111:29.21]Just a little bit of interference, that's all.
[111:31.43]I think there's a radio tower.
[111:32.85]Not that...
[111:36.96]Yeah, so as I was saying, this man is... Huh?
[111:41.16]Yeah.
[111:41.96]Well, I mean, I was gonna go.
[111:44.08]Hey, by the way, did I tell you that I'm really attracted to you?
[111:48.26]I saw you from the crowd, and I really thought maybe you and I could get a drink.
[111:52.48]I guess I'm like the third person that's... No, you know what?
[111:56.02]You're fucking... You're really just creeping me out at this point.
[111:58.31]I don't want anything to do with you.
[112:00.01]You know, I say, you know, I know, you know, I, you know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that.
[112:07.29]But, what do you, do you, do you think you and I are gonna drink some time?
[112:11.77]I can't fucking do this anymore.
[112:14.48]I've been doing this for fucking, this cutscene is so long, I have to fucking stop this.
[112:20.46]Quite a speech, nice armor.
[112:25.19]I don't even know what he said.
[112:26.17]No, that was quite a speech you just gave about tomatoes.
[112:30.13]Very interesting stuff.
[112:32.21]Yeah, I'd like to tell people about health and how they should take care of their bodies and all that stuff.
[112:38.45]Very important.
[112:38.87]My father was a doctor.
[112:43.51]Yeah.
[112:44.05]I should go to the blessing now.
[112:45.89]I think you've taken it.
[112:46.83]I mean, you should go to that blessing.
[112:49.38]I'm not going to be the one to bless you, but I'm going to be there.
[112:52.26]I'll be watching.
[112:53.52]know make sure that I have a front row seat because I'm really into that I'm really into blessings and that's the sort of thing you're really into blessings well I don't take you as that type ah you know those people don't but you know like I'm really into tomatoes and and by the way like by the way by the way by the way bye alright that I'm done with that that's it there you go we're putting the subtitles back on
[113:20.36]Dude, give me a break.
[113:21.42]It's hard to improvise fucking eight characters in a row.
[113:25.99]It's not easy.
[113:27.89]It's not easy.
[113:30.17]I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[113:31.39]I'm sorry.
[113:32.73]I'm sorry those of you that just got the first, like, major part of this game ruined for you.
[113:40.40]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[113:41.58]I'm being blessed or something?
[113:47.88]This is...
[113:51.60]Do the whole game like that?
[113:54.24]Oh, I kind of have to do it here too.
[113:56.00]Fuck.
[113:56.54]Okay.
[113:57.04]God damn it.
[113:57.72]I'm... Take a photo.
[114:02.98]No.
[114:03.99]Close photo mode.
[114:06.79]I just saw the people with the fucking hands in their... I'll do... This is it.
[114:12.51]This is the la... This is it.
[114:13.79]I just promise.
[114:16.33]This is the blessing.
[114:17.53]The blessing is the most important thing.
[114:19.30]This is it.
[114:19.82]I promise.
[114:20.10]This is it.
[114:28.91]Talk to Theresa.
[114:29.61]Let's go.
[114:37.79]Yes, young child.
[114:38.85]Are you ready for your blessing?
[114:44.12]Yes.
[114:54.05]I'm ready to receive.
[114:54.99]Yeah.
[115:03.16]Welcome all children of the God of the Green Earth.
[115:07.68]As you see before you, three major students will get their breath... I do this for me.
[115:16.15]And me only.
[115:17.63]No one else.
[115:19.25]No one else is going to take my place in this tribe but me.
[115:21.97]Uh-huh.
[115:29.75]Hey.
[115:41.16]Woohoo, yeah, woo!
[115:49.04]Woo!
[115:51.23]Woo!
[115:53.85]Woo!
[115:54.17]Somebody's supposed to be talking?
[115:58.74]It's time to run home!
[116:01.00]Who's that?
[116:02.43]Look at you!
[116:02.91]Look at you!
[116:03.43]Thanks for the blessing!
[116:04.03]Welcome to the blessing!
[116:04.93]Yes, yes, yes!
[116:08.25]Oh God, not this guy again.
[116:13.00]I saw what you did there.
[116:14.68]You put that little canister in the air.
[116:16.76]Yeah, no, that's a blessing.
[116:18.26]It's part of my tribe.
[116:19.72]Yeah, I mean, it's kind of dumb, don't you think?
[116:21.64]You know, if you came to my house and we did that, I would bless you.
[116:26.09]I would never come to your house.
[116:27.03]You're fucking freaking me out.
[116:28.03]Yeah, of course you would never come to my house.
[116:29.84]I've got a way cooler Bluetooth than you.
[116:32.92]Okay.
[116:36.09]That's it.
[116:36.51]That's it.
[116:37.01]I don't even know who this guy is.
[116:38.55]And it's going back on.
[116:45.44]Here we go.
[116:46.02]Who are you?
[116:46.33]My voice was pretty fucking close.
[116:47.49]My voice was pretty close.
[116:49.73]I was close.
[116:50.43]Just another outlander girl.
[116:51.65]A man's gotta make his shards.
[116:52.61]I just make mine in service to the king's court.
[116:56.39]That's all.
[117:14.59]I'm so lost.
[117:17.26]Does anybody know?
[117:19.04]Where exactly did you find it?
[117:21.03]In a ruin north of the claim.
[117:23.43]That's our name for the Asurum homeland.
[117:24.99]His voice is so boring.
[117:26.93]The metal seams run deep.
[117:29.03]Steel giants half buried in loose soil.
[117:31.80]Never trust a purple with 10 bucks.
[117:33.24]Thanks, dude.
[117:33.62]They say for at least two or three of those characters, you were extremely close to what they actually say in their dialog.
[117:38.76]Well, I mean, I can figure it's something like that.
[117:41.04]A ruin of the old ones.
[117:42.86]It has to be something like that, right?
[117:44.38]You know as much as I do.
[117:46.11]Go to those places for answers.
[117:48.53]Not me.
[117:51.99]Alright, how do I get away from this guy?
[117:53.35]Didn't he already say this?
[117:54.15]Your story is a better story.
[117:55.85]It has to be something like, want to get a drink.
[118:14.70]Like two characters say the same thing.
[118:18.98]What lazy fucking writing that would have been.
[118:22.18]If two of those characters said the same damn thing.
[118:24.31]Am I enjoying this game?
[118:25.75]By Adorable Boy, thank you for the $2.50.
[118:28.15]I'm not really into games like that.
[118:30.47]I'm not going to lie.
[118:32.89]I'm not going to bullshit you guys.
[118:44.90]I'm not really into games like this.
[118:49.51]Like, heavy dialog, heavy, like, Mass Effect-style choose, like, choice bubble, choice analog thing.
[118:56.23]But, I mean, it's probably very fun.
[119:00.53]I'm just super impatient.
[119:10.62]Okay, can I do my test now?
[119:13.06]Have I made it to the point where I can do my test?
[119:22.95]The open world is cool.
[119:25.01]Yeah, I'm just gonna assume that that's... It's just... I feel like this game's getting in its own way.
[119:31.71]Initially.
[119:33.93]Because they have all this cool shit, like these giant robot dinosaurs and all this cool gameplay.
[119:38.55]And they want to tell this...
[119:41.49]Super, super, ultra-generic story.
[119:45.47]Right?
[119:45.69]Because as, like, as interesting as the character is and the character design is, these are cool characters.
[119:53.21]But this is a very, like, this is a very just cliche default storyline.
[120:02.95]And to focus that much on, like, a default story like this?
[120:08.79]Oh, this is the bedhouse?
[120:12.10]With you standing guard, I figured it was the latrine.
[120:16.78]I wish I was voicing that.
[120:18.42]Too bad.
[120:21.52]Like, if you're gonna have a generic story like this, I feel like it should not be the main focus.
[120:25.81]Because it's been the major focus of the game.
[120:28.37]The motherless outcast.
[120:31.53]I see you've still got a scar from where that rock I threw hits you.
[120:34.57]Oh, that's the guy that threw the rock, like, two hours ago.
[120:38.19]You can be a real lard sometimes, boss.
[120:40.21]Cut it out.
[120:42.73]Like, the video game Horizon seems like it's fucking exceptional.
[120:46.87]It is exceptionally fun, I would assume.
[120:49.22]But it's getting in its own way to tell a generic story.
[120:53.54]So this is how it's gonna be with you, is it?
[121:03.72]This is how it's gonna be with everyone, outcast.
[121:05.74]This is eye paint.
[121:06.54]You belong in the wild.
[121:07.48]This lazy fucking eye makeup, by the way, dude.
[121:09.48]And you definitely don't belong in the proof.
[121:11.38]This dude freaked the fuck out in the mirror this morning.
[121:14.14]He was like, oh shit, I don't have any makeup on.
[121:15.95]Fuck, everyone's gonna... And he just smeared it on his eyes.
[121:19.25]Too bad for you that I'm gonna win it then.
[121:21.71]That is a last second makeup job.
[121:23.37]Look at how fucking shoddy that is.
[121:25.01]I'd make myself an outcast for life.
[121:27.43]Don't overestimate yourself.
[121:29.36]You wouldn't last long in the wilds.
[121:31.33]You know, I often think of the day I gave you that scar.
[121:34.93]It's a cherished memory.
[121:36.23]Am I gonna make this guy cry?
[121:37.07]You should cherish it.
[121:38.60]If Rost hadn't shot my stone from the air, you'd be missing an eye.
[121:41.48]Ten bucks says this guy cries.
[121:42.38]But I suppose you leave that part of the story out when you tell it, don't you?
[121:45.68]I branded you that day to mark your shame.
[121:49.33]He bandaged his hair.
[121:51.51]Just wait.
[121:54.60]Yeah, my hair got a cut on it.
[121:55.94]My hair got a cut.
[121:57.74]Is this an NVIDIA spokesperson?
[121:59.46]Like, just let me kick this guy's ass.
[122:29.75]I'm the super generic guy that talks down to the main character.
[122:34.27]You're not strong enough.
[122:35.65]You're not good enough.
[122:37.19]There's no way you'll ever survive.
[122:39.02]It's like, come on dude, like I'm fucking going to, I'm going to kill you.
[122:43.06]I'm going to kick the shit out of this guy.
[122:46.24]Like male or female, this guy is done, right?
[122:48.94]This guy, I'm going to like beat this guy and he's going to lose.
[122:51.30]That's it.
[122:56.66]How do I get out of here?
[122:57.40]I have to go to bed.
[123:05.74]Nothing wrong with generic?
[123:12.55]No, no, there's nothing wrong with generic.
[123:15.21]Nothing at all.
[123:16.81]Um... But when it takes you away from... I hate it.
[123:22.49]When it takes you out of, like, a cool gameplay experience... You know, it's like... I've seen this story a thousand times.
[123:31.72]Main character, nobody believes in main character.
[123:34.46]There's a bunch of people that don't think the main character is going to do anything substantial.
[123:38.50]Main character proves everybody wrong and does something substantial, and then the story is over.
[123:47.42]And there's nothing wrong with that, but that seems to be the main fucking focus of this game so far.
[123:58.03]When you have such cool, interesting shit in the game, like, you don't need a three hour long, generic storyline like this.
[124:17.31]Didn't we already do this montage where, like, I try to prove myself?
[124:22.57]Oh, oh, Jackson's going ahead.
[124:24.73]Oh, yeah, I'm beating you.
[124:26.50]Yeah, don't worry about him.
[124:29.52]Thanks for looking at me.
[124:30.72]Hey, you just looked at me and I could tell exactly what you were going to say.
[124:34.02]Thank you.
[124:40.10]And hold tight.
[124:46.49]Now.
[124:48.12]All of you need to listen very closely.
[124:51.33]Oh, fuck.
[124:52.15]I don't know why I thought for some reason the audio was turned off.
[124:55.39]What will it take to get you out of here?
[124:58.05]See?
[124:58.75]See?
[124:59.55]See?
[124:59.97]Like, what?
[125:00.39]See what I'm talking about?
[125:01.68]Yeah, see?
[125:03.38]What's gonna happen here?
[125:07.06]Yeah, everybody doesn't, like, believe in the main character.
[125:11.74]I don't know what I do.
[125:12.38]I don't know what I do.
[125:18.87]It's like jump to slow down time.
[125:24.81]Kill this one.
[125:26.01]Do I get points with that yet?
[125:26.93]Alright, I got one.
[125:32.50]Loot my trophy.
[125:35.82]Okay, I got my trophy.
[125:44.51]Yes, I did it!
[125:48.77]That was me, the bad guy, bully dickhead.
[125:50.63]Loot a second trophy.
[125:52.31]Oh, come on.
[126:13.63]Running at me now?
[126:19.09]The weak point's on the butt.
[126:23.77]Come on, give it to me again.
[126:24.77]Give me zero items.
[126:28.39]What are you talking about?
[126:29.65]Zero items.
[126:32.53]Zero items?
[126:33.45]What?
[126:33.85]Oh, I already got it.
[126:36.67]What is this?
[126:37.57]Glaze?
[126:38.03]Let's go.
[126:43.52]Everything after this is not a forced linear cliche.
[126:46.72]Oh, I... I believe you to the fullest extent.
[126:51.18]But that's my only complaint so far is the fact that, like... This is such a cool game here.
[126:56.85]This is such a great game.
[126:59.31]They didn't need to drag out the first three or four hours with...
[127:04.53]Hey, remember that story you've already seen a hundred fucking times?
[127:10.81]Well, we're doing it again.
[127:13.09]And you don't get to play.
[127:14.77]You gotta watch this.
[127:15.27]Yeah.
[127:15.41]Okay, so that means I go on it.
[127:38.70]Have I ever played The Witcher 3?
[127:39.68]I have not.
[127:40.72]I've heard very good things, though.
[127:41.76]You know, I would seriously, like... When is a game or when is a movie gonna do this?
[127:47.34]Right?
[127:55.62]It's insane to go that way.
[127:56.58]You're crazy.
[127:57.22]Don't do it.
[127:58.52]I die right now.
[128:00.48]Like, I'm dead.
[128:01.60]I fall down and I break my fucking neck.
[128:04.56]Right?
[128:05.48]When is somebody going to do that?
[128:22.26]Right now.
[128:23.54]Right now.
[128:28.72]Oh, God, man.
[128:29.62]Come on.
[128:31.62]Where do I go?
[128:33.36]Where do I go?
[128:37.74]Down here?
[128:39.64]I don't go down here.
[128:58.81]What the fuck is happening?
[129:03.19]Did I miss something?
[129:05.53]I'm still laughing.
[129:07.82]I'm like, fuck it.
[129:12.10]Let me go back to what I was saying.
[129:15.76]Imagine if that happened in the actual game and that was supposed to happen and you took control of another character and that was the main character.
[129:24.02]When the fuck is anybody going to do something like that?
[129:30.56]You know what I mean?
[129:32.66]That would be so awesome.
[129:43.11]Let's just do this.
[129:43.95]Here we go.
[129:48.53]Climb up.
[129:52.15]Battlefield does that?
[129:57.00]I don't know.
[129:57.46]I've never really played it.
[129:58.20]It'd be too jarring.
[130:00.06]Yeah, but it would shake things up a little bit.
[130:02.30]It'd be like, whoa!
[130:05.81]I would be so happy if that would actually happen.
[130:13.41]I didn't... I was looking at fucking chat!
[130:15.65]God damn it!
[130:22.58]I'm sitting there reading chat and I just walk off the fucking cliff.
[130:26.73]Okay, she apparently couldn't do this shit.
[130:30.73]I like to, I'm just so, like, this is, oh my god.
[130:36.17]Like, this is so linear and just fucking scripted and, like, impossible to, like, lose that I'm losing it.
[130:44.22]I just have to walk in a fucking straight line.
[130:46.96]Can we just pretend like I already did this?
[130:48.72]Can I fight the dinosaurs now?
[130:51.04]Can I please fight the fucking giant beasts and the cool shit?
[130:54.10]I don't want to prove myself on the proving grounds in the three-hour-long scripted linear tutorial of the game.
[131:03.44]...my whole life for this.
[131:05.60]They had a trial, but I had the wild.
[131:09.02]Precision, not enough.
[131:09.69]Must be perfect.
[131:13.40]This is like cool.
[131:15.20]I don't want to dog the game.
[131:16.26]I'm not going to dog the game.
[131:17.38]I'm not going to dog the game.
[131:21.28]Because it's cool.
[131:23.03]It's awesome.
[131:23.67]It's a great concept.
[131:24.95]How do I grab this?
[131:28.89]Grab it.
[131:29.21]I almost didn't grab it for some reason.
[131:36.83]Wouldn't that technically be considered cheating?
[131:41.70]Didn't I do what all the bad guys in movies and TV shows and cartoons do?
[131:44.97]Is like, I cheated.
[131:46.01]I went around the path.
[131:48.41]Say, yeah.
[131:50.15]I cheated.
[131:51.27]So I cheated.
[131:55.85]See?
[131:58.59]I've been disqualified.
[132:00.97]Okay.
[132:03.65]I guess cheating, you can cheat to win.
[132:06.52]Guys, in life, remember, cheat to win and it's okay.
[132:13.25]But it is Aloy, once outcast, and now brave, who is first among us.
[132:22.80]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[132:26.02]Wait, what the fuck is happening?
[132:27.72]I kind of wish I was fucking doing the voice there.
[132:35.99]Keep them pinned down until the others arrive.
[132:45.00]Kinda wish I was, like, doing that.
[132:47.36]I feel like that would've been fun to do.
[132:54.32]Oh, now the friends become enemies!
[132:57.89]Enemies become friends!
[133:01.67]Sometimes enemies become your friend during cheated situations!
[133:08.55]Too many of them.
[133:09.95]Dude, I don't know if you know this, but I have, like, Jump Super Mario slow-mo.
[133:16.00]I have fire arrows, too.
[133:23.26]That's so funny that I can just, like, jump in the air.
[133:27.57]Give me this jib.
[133:30.87]Pick up the herb.
[133:36.81]He hurts me way more than I hurt him.
[133:38.42]Sure.
[133:42.64]He's dead.
[133:45.62]Pick it up.
[133:46.74]Pick it up.
[133:52.93]We can't stop them.
[133:53.67]Yes, we can.
[133:54.59]Don't have them.
[133:56.57]Where'd he go?
[134:02.23]Shit.
[134:02.55]Nice jump, dude.
[134:03.41]I'll give you that one.
[134:06.80]I'll give you that one.
[134:10.49]R2 is way better than R1, so why the hell am I not using that?
[134:14.23]Don't ask me.
[134:23.76]This Super Mario jump is so great.
[134:25.06]Is it too many of them?
[134:25.74]Uh oh.
[134:40.60]Kill them all no witnesses.
[134:42.72]No survive no witnesses.
[134:43.92]I remember that one no witnesses So I thought that she's gonna die right and Bast is gonna survive and me and bass are gonna be like friends That's a that's a good guy Kill the attackers.
[134:59.05]I mean
[135:07.08]Why am I the only one to... Wow, you just came out of nowhere, dude.
[135:09.90]Oh, shit.
[135:14.72]You guys have long fucking reach.
[135:20.88]Is there a lock-on?
[135:21.78]Not really.
[135:23.60]You guys suck.
[135:36.40]Holy shit, Bast, you're terrible.
[135:38.00]We can only hold three health potions at the same time.
[135:45.43]Well, whatever.
[135:46.73]These guys all have nonsense.
[135:50.51]Ah.
[135:51.07]Right in the head, come on.
[136:07.79]The Super Mario jump is freaking me out sometimes.
[136:11.79]I'm kind of sick of doing this actually.
[136:36.16]This is kinda cool, I guess.
[136:37.64]Does that guy not know where I am?
[136:47.45]I'm just hammering this guy.
[136:51.31]You gotta hit them once with an R2, and they die.
[136:53.97]What are you doing?
[136:59.01]Pick it up!
[136:59.36]Pick it up!
[137:04.64]You're astonished this game wasn't made by Ubisoft?
[137:06.78]Right in the back of the skull.
[137:12.30]Got him.
[137:16.47]I feel like I keep killing that guy and he's still living.
[137:26.09]Now, descend while we have a chance.
[137:29.97]This is the worst combat system than Man of War Corsair.
[137:33.57]Man of War Corsair is like one of the greatest games.
[137:36.11]And that guy has a machine gun.
[137:37.43]That's not fair.
[137:38.59]They're just introducing guns now?
[137:43.03]Not only did they just introduce guns.
[137:45.11]It's a mini gun.
[137:47.15]See, I told you she was dead.
[137:50.33]I told you.
[137:52.03]Nice job, you fucking idiot.
[137:55.09]What an idiot.
[137:57.19]That guy just ran into machine gun fire.
[138:01.57]What the hell was that for?
[138:07.39]Seriously.
[138:09.90]For all the shit that that guy talked, you have terrible combat awareness, dude.
[138:14.88]God, this is not good.
[138:24.31]Let's hit him.
[138:28.09]R2.
[138:29.95]Oh, fuck.
[138:34.85]That didn't hit him in the face?
[138:38.01]What?
[138:42.94]You're dead.
[138:44.26]Can I take his gun?
[138:45.84]This dude's gun is so much fucking cooler than mine.
[138:57.53]I can take the gun.
[139:05.50]This is so unfair.
[139:06.64]Okay.
[139:14.63]Can I have that?
[139:21.23]Oh no, he had one of those weird blue tooths.
[139:23.07]One of the orange ones.
[139:26.23]She just eats it.
[139:29.91]There you are.
[139:35.24]You were supposed to die.
[139:36.50]I set that up.
[139:37.78]I'm on the other side.
[139:38.70]I'm the owner of the last tribe, and it was me that set up that whole thing.
[139:41.80]I double-crossed you all.
[139:42.92]And now you'll be dropped, and you'll die.
[139:49.88]And then Dad's gonna shoot him with a bow.
[139:52.84]Oh, who did that?
[139:54.92]Who could have done that?
[139:55.92]It's me, Dad!
[139:57.10]Oh, shit!
[139:58.28]Come here!
[139:59.28]Hi-yah!

[140:13.79]No, I almost had you.
[140:23.19]Your feathers are getting close to my face.
[140:25.79]No, the feather is going to stab me.
[140:27.35]I don't want to get stabbed by a feather.
[140:31.31]Oh no, dad is dead.
[140:35.42]Oh, he was choking me for a second.
[140:36.82]I can't move he had his hand around my neck for like a second I couldn't I can't move to save my father Burn it all I'm sorry that I'm just like fucking ruining this for everybody

[141:11.99]Give a fuck.
[141:17.13]We're doing this again here right now.
[141:23.39]My daughter, listen to me.
[141:25.87]The most important lesson of your journey.
[141:29.73]You need to listen to me.
[141:32.41]Oh, a bomb.
[141:34.23]Oh, a bomb.
[141:35.72]Oh, shit.
[141:36.38]There's a bomb over there.
[141:37.72]Alloy.
[141:38.08]I just pushed you off.
[141:41.52]Damn it.
[141:42.56]Oh, fuck.
[141:43.54]I didn't mean to push you.
[141:45.12]Oh, whoops.
[141:55.53]Whoops.
[141:59.52]Whoops.
[142:19.53]He, like, didn't mean to do that.
[142:22.98]That is not supposed to be funny.
[142:28.30]This is not funny.
[142:38.33]I don't look, I don't hate people saying that I hate this game.
[142:40.73]I don't hate this game.
[142:41.69]I promise.
[142:43.11]I promise that I'm, like, I'm enjoying this experience.
[142:45.55]I promise you.
[142:48.98]Still alive?
[142:49.54]Ah, I just got burned.
[142:52.51]No, I turned into a lady for a second.
[142:55.13]But, you know, it's okay.
[142:57.59]Ah!
[143:02.19]Oh, I'm supposed to be doing this.
[143:10.38]I don't hate this game.
[143:12.16]I don't.
[143:12.54]I promise I don't hate this game.
[143:13.84]No, I don't.
[143:14.52]I really don't.
[143:15.47]Wait, what?
[143:18.38]That was just important for right there.
[143:20.00]We can turn this back on.
[143:26.68]Ow.
[143:30.58]Was that a dream?
[143:33.62]Or did that really all happen?
[143:35.66]Or was it just in my head?
[143:38.38]Oh, I have to sit down again.
[143:39.56]Damn it.
[143:41.88]How much did I drink last night?

[148:30.10]Menu is not available right now.
[148:33.08]Search for your focus.
[148:34.13]Not great.
[148:37.47]I can't focus on fucking anything, even in real life.
[148:39.83]Oh, good.
[148:40.23]Thank God it's a cutscene.
[148:43.31]Thank God it's a cutscene.
[148:44.35]I don't have to look for it.
[148:48.32]They still have Dad's toot.
[148:50.20]Ooh.
[148:50.92]Yes.
[148:51.18]You're a matriarch now.
[149:09.36]Nora survivor like your break a search search for your equipment Yeah, blast or shit.
[149:15.38]I got to do one of these dumb fucking things This is alright.
[149:19.56]This is what I'm talking about This is what I meant guys when I told you Okay, maybe e3 remember liquid e3 when they showed all this fucking awesome shit in this game look
[149:33.78]That was one of the coolest E3 trailers that I've seen in a long time.
[149:37.47]And I'm looking for my clothes in a cave.
[149:40.59]And it's been like two and a half hours of playing this game.
[149:43.71]And I have not really dicked... Look, I have not dicked around that much.
[149:46.68]I really haven't.
[149:48.04]I've done each mission.
[149:49.24]I haven't really explored.
[149:50.44]I've just kind of done the shit I need to do, right?
[149:55.62]What do you mean be on your way?
[149:57.28]They have to like open...
[149:59.85]When I was a child, I had to open this door with a fucking key code.
[150:03.03]Seriously.
[150:03.55]Just open the doors.
[150:08.90]Every game needs filler.
[150:09.74]Every game does need... I agree.
[150:13.70]But I don't think the filler should start at the very beginning of the game.
[150:17.36]You know?
[150:18.80]All games need filler.
[150:21.61]Every game is going to have it.
[150:23.37]But...
[150:25.68]Does it have to be at the very beginning of the game?
[150:29.39]I don't think so.
[150:30.23]It shouldn't be the first three hours.
[150:31.87]Hey, can you hear me now?
[150:39.85]Good.
[150:41.15]Horizon.
[150:42.66]Verizon.
[150:44.32]There's a bow.
[150:45.52]Oh, yeah, okay.
[150:46.54]Just making sure.
[150:47.34]I didn't know what that was for a second.
[150:48.60]I need to make sure I knew what it was.
[150:49.62]It's a bow.
[150:51.54]What's this?
[150:51.88]Oh, this is from Sprint.
[150:53.82]No, I don't want to use this one.
[150:56.32]I have my Verizon headset.
[150:57.64]Ow, it burnt me!
[150:58.20]I don't need to do... Yeah, Horizon.
[151:10.45]All commanders, halt excavations and proceed at once to the mission point.
[151:14.49]Avoid all contact with Norah's savages.
[151:17.13]But if you are seen, kill every witness.
[151:20.21]Target imaging attached.
[151:23.85]That's Crispin, um, that's the Winston voice actor, by the way.
[151:26.50]Crispin, uh... Crispin Freeman.
[151:29.26]Look it up.
[151:29.78]Got it.
[151:30.34]Bang.
[151:30.66]Crispin Freeman.
[151:31.52]That is Crispin Freeman.
[151:32.44]I know voice actors.
[151:33.14]I know voice acting.
[151:34.16]You don't think I know who these people are?
[151:35.30]I got Ashley Burch within five seconds.
[151:40.63]How is that possible?
[151:51.24]Then make it quick.
[151:51.96]I'm heading in.
[151:53.22]Hold for identity scan.
[151:55.52]You need to stop listening to Ted and start listening to me.
[152:02.71]Where's this from?
[152:04.81]And when?
[152:08.39]Who cares?
[152:10.31]Who cares?
[152:10.79]It's a DNA match at a 99.4% chance that that's your mommy.
[152:14.89]Oh, no.
[152:16.05]She's the Terminator.
[152:17.95]She's the Terminator.
[152:20.44]Yes, honey.
[152:21.72]I am the Terminator.
[152:29.53]I heard something!
[152:30.05]It's me!
[152:32.07]You know what?
[152:33.19]Sometimes you just don't give a fuck, right?
[152:35.33]I think it's one of those nights.
[152:40.71]Don't shoot!
[152:42.07]What are you doing here?
[152:44.35]Sometimes I sleep down here, but you know, it's not a big deal.
[152:47.61]Follow me.
[152:48.05]Let's walk and talk for a second.
[152:49.33]I want to tell you something.
[152:50.55]About your mother.
[152:51.28]My mother.
[152:54.68]Oh, god damn it.
[152:56.88]Now we have to... There's no chance for me to do it, so we have to listen because there's no mouth movements now.
[153:06.86]See?
[153:08.18]Bullshit.
[153:08.66]Why wasn't this a cutscene?
[153:11.12]Why the fuck wasn't this a cutscene?
[153:12.58]Because, whatever.
[153:16.68]It's Gruntilda.
[153:19.71]Die, you old bitch!
[153:23.95]Okay.
[153:25.91]Why did you bring me here?
[153:27.67]It seemed you were dying.
[153:30.03]See, I told you I wasn't going to be able to do it.
[153:32.15]Lantra fought it, of course, but jetticided with me.
[153:36.59]Is my mother here?
[153:37.88]Am I gonna meet my mother?
[153:40.54]Oh, wow.
[153:48.27]You know, Hideo Kojima would have made this game and all this shit would have been a, like, 15 full-on minute cutscene in the very beginning of the game.
[154:08.90]What's through... What is through this door, Gruntilda?
[154:17.12]Ah, well, this is the bathroom.
[154:19.16]It's a very sacred bathroom.
[154:20.44]It's where I go to the bathroom every day.
[154:23.42]You never want to shit your pants when you're down here, you know?
[154:27.06]I... but... I don't... Where is my mother?
[154:31.18]Why are you showing me the bathroom?
[154:33.44]Well, you know... Let me just open this for a second.
[154:37.10]I won't talk till I get in there.
[154:39.53]It's fairly complicated, child.
[154:42.17]Complicated?
[154:43.48]Yes.
[154:46.00]This is your bathroom?
[154:48.12]Yes, I like to keep my bathroom fairly large, and all these coffins you see on the left and right are different toilets that I use on different days of the week.
[154:57.90]You see the toilet over here on the left, that's Monday's toilet.
[155:00.78]That's over there.
[155:02.08]That's what I use.
[155:02.90]I only poop in that one.
[155:04.60]And Tuesday's toilet's over there to your right, if you see, if you look that way.
[155:07.64]Tuesday's is over there.
[155:09.24]Tuesday?
[155:09.52]But what about Wednesday?
[155:10.82]Wednesday's the most important.
[155:11.64]Yes, Wednesday is the most important poop day.
[155:14.08]That's over here, if you follow me.
[155:16.36]But more importantly, this is Saturday.
[155:18.71]Up here, up in this area, this is Saturday's toilet, where it's the most important of the whole week.
[155:22.99]You said Wednesday.
[155:23.95]I don't believe that for a second.
[155:27.11]But...
[155:28.36]Where did my mother go to the bathroom?
[155:32.58]Well, your mother didn't usually go to the bathroom.
[155:35.10]She was an android, and that's a big reveal, a big secret reveal.
[155:39.68]But, God, how do you like how this looks?
[155:42.36]Should I add some curtains to it?
[155:43.79]Should I put some curtains on the Saturday toilet?
[155:45.97]I think so.
[155:46.77]What do you think?
[155:47.79]I think I'm going to do it tomorrow.
[155:49.33]Tomorrow afternoon, we're going to do this.
[155:50.57]You and I are going to work on that.
[155:51.61]By the way, I'm signing you up for this.
[155:53.17]You're going to help me down here, of course.
[155:54.81]You're going to make these curtains for me.
[155:59.06]I don't know.
[155:59.44]I'm just... I'm not sure.
[156:01.48]Like, why would anybody have a Saturday toilet like this?
[156:05.15]It's just so large and beautiful.
[156:07.97]Yeah.
[156:09.27]Yeah, it is.
[156:11.22]But child, more importantly, when you go into the Saturday toilet... Ugh, let me just get down on the ground for a second.
[156:16.39]I'm already feeling the burrito I had earlier.
[156:19.81]Oh, I'm gonna need to use that in a second.
[156:21.35]You're gonna have to get out of the way.
[156:23.07]I'm at 85% shit in my body.
[156:25.59]I'm at 99.4% shit in my body.
[156:28.67]You're gonna have to get out of the way in just a second, honey.
[156:30.61]I don't know if I can hold this any longer.
[156:33.17]But... But... I don't understand.
[156:36.28]How can...
[156:39.85]How can my mother have never used a bat?
[156:45.95]What does it all mean?
[156:47.31]Somebody explain it to me.
[156:48.31]I don't know.
[156:49.84]Oh, hold on a second.
[156:50.68]I'm starting to feel it, too.
[156:52.20]Oh, yeah.
[156:53.98]I think I got to go, too.
[156:54.84]Does it work?
[156:59.60]Oh, you know, I got it, honey.
[157:03.71]It's okay.
[157:04.85]I just wet my pants.
[157:08.67]I went into my pants back there, so I don't need to use the Saturday toilet.
[157:12.21]I'm okay.
[157:13.41]But you, for instance, you can use it if you want to.
[157:16.69]I think I'm going to need to.
[157:19.15]I think I'm going to have to use it in a very short while.
[157:22.58]But listen, get up and stop being such a nincompoop about this whole thing.
[157:26.86]I am actually your mother.
[157:28.88]Did I tell you that already?
[157:31.28]What?
[157:32.68]You're my mother?
[157:34.76]Yes.
[157:35.62]If you want to be such a brat about it, I've been your mother this whole time.
[157:39.46]But my mother's been dead for 40 years.
[157:43.10]It's possible.
[157:43.84]You see, through DNA splicing, I was able to make my way through the wormhole.
[157:50.09]Wormhole?
[157:51.39]I've only read about those in books.
[157:52.97]Yeah.
[157:53.73]Do they actually exist?
[157:55.39]It can't be possible.
[157:57.15]It is possible.
[157:58.27]Not only is it... Oh, this is a different person talking.
[158:00.99]I was talking for a second.
[158:03.95]But now we're not talking.
[158:05.91]No, but now I'm talking.
[158:09.80]Let's see if it makes you feel any better.
[158:13.44]I've been... Have a good day.
[158:22.56]Use the toilet if you need to.
[158:29.28]This whole stream has just been this.
[158:33.34]And he ran out of ideas.
[158:44.86]That was a long cutscene.
[158:46.62]I did not expect that shit to be that fucking long.
[158:50.12]I thought it was going to be like 30 seconds long.
[158:52.00]I have no idea what's going on in this story.
[158:54.32]I like it.
[158:55.03]No spoilers.
[158:55.31]I mean, it's true.
[159:09.76]80% one long poop that was a really important part too was it really Always toilet humor typical
[159:34.60]Oh god, seriously.
[159:37.68]Can we play?
[159:39.34]Can I play Horizon Zero Dawn?
[159:41.56]That's the same person!
[159:42.82]I've heard people really like this game.
[159:50.89]That's the most important.
[159:54.91]The whole story was just explained to you, but you just made a shit joke.
[160:06.21]Why are they not talking anymore?
[160:10.63]I didn't do this.
[160:11.39]I'm just doing it now.
[160:17.14]You like watching the stream because you're getting no spoilers and you feel like you know nothing about the game so far?
[160:22.12]Well, good.
[160:30.22]Well, I'm glad that you can enjoy the stream.
[160:34.17]Now they're talking again.
[160:35.71]Okay, I'll be quiet.
[160:42.35]Game sucks.
[160:43.03]Game doesn't suck.
[160:43.85]Game just is very dragged out.
[160:49.85]Now they're not talking again.
[160:54.34]She's just pointing at things.
[160:57.02]Now there's not even subtitles.
[160:59.26]What is going on?
[161:00.98]Yeah.
[161:06.54]I think I turned off the cutscenes too much.
[161:10.12]I fucking broke the game.
[161:12.86]You are.
[161:13.48]Apparently this game gets good after the opening minutes?
[161:17.44]Minutes?
[161:17.66]This has been almost three hours of this.
[161:20.42]It's been three hours.
[161:21.60]It's been a very long fucking time.
[161:22.81]Can I leave?
[161:40.10]Just play without sound.
[161:41.50]I have to turn up the whole thing.
[161:42.74]Yeah.
[161:42.94]Hideo Kojima makes a long cutscene.
[162:05.81]I wouldn't mind long cut scenes, but like... This is sort of ridiculous.
[162:09.87]This is sort of getting ridiculous, don't you think?
[162:12.33]Am I insane?
[162:12.85]Tell me if I'm crazy.
[162:16.03]Tell me I'm crazy.
[162:17.17]Because I know I'm crazy.
[162:18.83]I know I'm fucking out of my mind.
[162:20.93]But in this situation, am I crazy to think that like three hours should not have to go by to start playing this game?
[162:27.31]Right?
[162:27.53]Am I crazy about this?
[162:38.27]Have you seen this?
[162:38.77]Have you heard about this?
[162:47.82]It was ridiculous.
[162:50.63]I mean, it started fun.
[162:53.89]I made a seven minute long poop joke because there was a seven minute long cutscene.
[162:59.76]Let's climb this shit.
[163:01.54]Let's go.
[163:02.04]I don't... I don't... Can you imagine if I was to take this whole world in and talk to every person?
[163:07.92]Talk to everything?
[163:08.70]It would be even longer than three hours.
[163:12.52]It would be like four hours.
[163:13.42]A week has passed.
[163:14.32]Why am I talking about three hours?
[163:16.68]Whatever happened to the robot dinosaurs?
[163:18.85]I know!
[163:28.72]Maybe this game just sucks.
[163:30.16]It doesn't.
[163:33.77]This game definitely doesn't suck.
[163:35.21]This game definitely does not suck.
[163:36.53]I'm certain of that.
[163:52.30]You're a nobody you dishonor the dead watch your tongue and where were you when those children were being slaughtered or the war party ambushed guarding your little gate here I
[164:11.22]If you think this game sucks, you really need to play more games.
[164:14.60]I don't think this game sucks.
[164:16.26]I just think it's starting very slow.
[164:20.25]That's all.
[164:23.97]Who paid me?
[164:26.67]Alright, fine.
[164:27.85]Alright, fine.
[164:29.21]Who made this game?
[164:31.57]Who published this game?
[164:32.39]Sony?
[164:33.83]Gorilla.
[164:35.29]And it was published by Sony Interactive.
[164:36.87]Finally, I get a monster.
[164:38.75]Fuck that dumb joke I was gonna make.
[164:39.95]Let's fight a monster.
[164:45.50]Come on.
[164:45.84]Give me a big one.
[164:47.16]Make this all worthwhile.
[164:48.10]Give me a huge... That's what I'm talking about.
[164:49.90]Like a huge T-Rex.
[164:54.82]Nice.
[164:56.42]This is what I wanted.
[164:59.86]I wanted to fight the fucking giant ghost in the shell enemy.
[165:03.21]Come on.
[165:17.67]Let me fight it.
[165:21.99]No, don't let the cutscene fight it, let me fight it.
[165:25.59]Let me fight the giant scorpion.
[165:32.86]What have you brought on us now, in front of this curse?
[165:37.10]Kill them Braves!
[165:38.60]Kill them all!
[165:43.28]Okay.
[165:44.66]Let's do it.
[165:45.49]Let's fight the monster.
[165:46.43]I'm going to open the front door.
[165:47.47]I can't open the front door.
[165:50.65]Okay.
[165:51.47]Kill the demon and the corrupted machine.
[165:52.97]Well, I just jumped down from the one spot I wanted to be in.
[165:55.05]Is he going to break in here?
[166:04.36]Where's the demon?
[166:13.10]Let's get some fire arrows here.
[166:16.34]Let's do it.
[166:16.80]Alright, let's scan him first.
[166:19.17]See where his weak point is.
[166:21.99]Alright, right in the top.
[166:22.85]Right in the canister on his butt.
[166:24.47]On his back.
[166:28.07]Wow, he throws rocks!
[166:29.13]Okay, he throws rocks.
[166:30.16]Alright, 23.
[166:38.14]Let's get the fire.
[166:38.96]What's he weak to?
[166:39.70]I can't really look.
[166:41.86]Kind of kicking ass though.
[166:45.82]Is he weak to fire?
[166:52.32]Kind of.
[166:53.16]Weak to fire.
[167:01.98]Ow.
[167:04.30]Ow.
[167:06.13]Come on, Metal Gear Ray.
[167:11.77]I gotta trap him.
[167:12.77]Did he not get trapped?
[167:22.58]Did I not trap this guy?
[167:33.68]There's a supply cache right here.
[167:43.54]Yikes.
[167:46.62]Run away.
[167:47.26]Give me the supplies.
[167:48.86]All my fucking people are dead right now.
[167:58.28]Can I like light this motherfucker on fire?
[167:59.98]I kind of want to kill these things.
[168:04.24]Is it more than one?
[168:07.24]No.
[168:08.78]Let's clear out all the shitties first, right?
[168:13.46]Ow.
[168:15.04]Ow.
[168:19.19]Apparently the weak points though.
[168:31.78]Alright, I might have to do this again.
[168:34.64]You have unused outfit equipment.
[168:41.36]What?
[168:47.34]You can't light robots on fire.
[168:49.08]I mean, you can.
[168:49.82]They're weak.
[168:54.41]Yeah, I kind of used a bunch of shit that I shouldn't have.
[169:03.47]Oh god.
[169:06.26]It's a mess.
[169:08.28]I'm gonna shoot... I'm probably gonna die.
[169:16.80]I'm going to be as real as I can with you guys.
[169:19.13]Analog aiming kind of makes me want to rip my teeth out with pliers.
[169:27.93]How do I let this guy up?
[169:35.06]Can I make a healing potion somehow?
[169:43.41]No, I'm dead.
[169:48.81]Alright.
[169:50.15]Okay.
[169:51.73]Let's do that again.
[169:56.88]Just abuse the slow-mo.
[170:00.54]Well, I'm going to do that now.
[170:02.22]This is so analog.
[170:02.84]What?
[170:20.85]watch the striders it's driven them mad alright let's identify let's identify the that is so cheap the fact that like I can do that use the minigun what minigun what are you talking about minigun that I haven't seen that is so like abusing the system right there honestly
[171:00.80]He's like jumping in the air like, I'm jumping, I'm gonna save the day.
[171:03.53]I kinda wanna kill these guys with just like regular swings.
[171:08.25]Oh my- I'm fucking instantly dead.
[171:10.87]That was not a smart idea.
[171:22.08]That was very stupid.
[171:24.45]Okay, how come me hitting him in the face does that much damage and me shooting him in the weak points doesn't hurt?
[171:28.60]What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[171:40.96]Don't step in that.
[171:42.92]Ow.
[171:46.73]Step on it.
[171:47.39]Step on it.
[171:48.59]Step on it.
[171:56.33]I feel like it doesn't do anything.
[172:11.12]Get the crotch shot.
[172:18.79]I need to abuse the jump, I forgot.
[172:25.27]I'm gonna abuse jump shot.
[172:26.65]13!
[172:32.00]Why did I not shoot?
[172:38.38]Shoot the gun!
[172:40.10]Shoot the gun!
[172:45.72]This is so stupid.
[172:50.18]I'm jumping!
[172:52.86]I make the game easier by hitting X.
[172:59.35]That is such abuse.
[173:02.85]It's like dead now.
[173:06.02]Oh fuck, he's dead.
[173:15.90]Okay.
[173:17.89]We won.
[173:20.51]Right, shooting weak spots.
[173:21.85]Yeah, not shooting weak spots because it does 23 damage and it does 30 if you shoot it in the face.
[173:31.33]Every NPC is watching you like when did she get her fucking moon shoes?
[173:42.06]How did you do that
[173:51.33]What are you doing here?
[173:53.03]You're a stitcher, not a brave.
[173:54.51]A stitcher?
[173:55.19]What does that mean?
[173:55.65]I came to help defend Mother's Watch.
[173:56.77]I've watched half the cutscenes.
[173:58.04]What is a stitcher?
[173:58.54]I never imagined I'd see anything like this.
[174:00.18]You gotta break the weak points off?
[174:01.36]Like what, my spear?
[174:02.54]Just like smack them off?
[174:03.42]The way it controls the machines.
[174:08.75]I think I figured it out.
[174:10.77]But I need to test it on a machine.
[174:13.87]Plenty of striders along the path to the gates of the embrace, I guess.
[174:18.06]Exactly.
[174:19.12]Weed boy.
[174:19.76]The gates are where I'll be headed anyway.
[174:21.08]Yeah, this is the first time I've heard this guy speak.
[174:22.70]I need to speak to Varl.
[174:24.28]I always knew you were different, Aloy, but... But what?
[174:28.80]I think you're a blessing from All-Mother.
[174:31.48]No matter what Resh says.
[174:32.50]I'm still moving.
[174:36.01]It's going to get up and attack me.
[174:37.61]I know you do.
[174:40.27]And my thoughts go with you.
[174:45.66]Okay, use... Okay, let me do this first.
[174:47.38]Crafting.
[174:48.22]Modify outfits.
[174:49.06]I guess resist... I'm going to put it in, I guess.
[175:00.22]Why not?
[175:02.78]I'm currently using this, right?
[175:04.02]Okay, good.
[175:06.01]Carry capacity?
[175:08.71]Tripcaster ammo pouch upgrade.
[175:10.25]I get... Why not?
[175:10.95]Let's do it.
[175:14.77]Ammo, ammo packs, shock wire.
[175:16.55]Okay, I gotta hold up a six.
[175:17.59]No, that's good.
[175:20.11]What about weapon modifications?
[175:24.23]Spear.
[175:26.23]The bow.
[175:26.87]Okay, the bow has two, but I already did them.
[175:30.11]Fuck.
[175:31.86]Freeze, corruption.
[175:33.04]Okay.
[175:34.28]Interesting.
[175:36.44]Let's put the skill points we have in.
[175:39.82]See what is worthwhile.
[175:45.03]High?
[175:45.33]Okay, yeah.
[175:45.84]I want this.
[175:47.24]R1 for like downed enemies.
[175:48.90]People that are down.
[175:49.62]Absolutely.
[175:52.98]Can just slow down time without jumping.
[175:54.60]But what's the fun in that?
[175:57.60]Silently drop down.
[176:02.69]Additional resources.
[176:03.77]I like that.
[176:04.41]Let's get it.
[176:06.49]We're just so spread out.
[176:07.41]Who gives a shit?
[176:09.39]Critical hit deals more damage.
[176:11.73]Let's do that too.
[176:14.69]High damage on a downed enemy.
[176:15.99]So when enemies get trapped or stunned or downed, I can actually do a ton of damage.
[176:19.37]That's fine.
[176:20.97]Cool.
[176:22.57]Alright.
[176:26.40]Pick up the stuff on these dudes.
[176:29.36]I think there's a take all.
[176:30.28]I don't know why I have not been using it.
[176:31.62]Don't ask me why.
[176:32.36]I got the meatball.
[176:36.68]The PS4 overrides are available.
[176:39.71]Override.
[176:40.11]Watch your stride or charge your taunt.
[176:41.75]Okay.
[176:41.99]Okay.
[176:45.40]So I gotta go that way.
[176:48.82]Open the gate.
[176:52.10]Can the gate be opened?
[176:56.12]All the time abilities are overpowered.
[176:57.84]I'll get him.
[177:02.70]Let's go.
[177:04.34]Can I fast travel to over here?
[177:08.96]Not really.
[177:09.80]I guess, what about here?
[177:13.07]Yeah.
[177:16.78]The intro still isn't over.
[177:22.73]Yeah, it is a three-hour tutorial.
[177:25.07]It is?
[177:27.75]Save it here.
[177:28.25]I can't save?
[177:30.93]Why not?
[177:32.83]There we go.
[177:36.27]Test the override device on a machine.
[177:39.13]Well, where is the override device?
[177:46.59]Do I have to equip it?
[177:51.75]Okay, so approach undetected and press triangle when prompted.
[178:01.29]Okay.
[178:02.61]Is this the mount thing you guys were talking about before?
[178:04.83]He's looking right at me.
[178:10.48]I'm holding.
[178:10.90]So now what?
[178:18.63]Now here's my mount.
[178:19.47]Tapping X can increase the mount's speed.
[178:20.97]Oh shit.
[178:22.71]Okay, now I finally get my mount.
[178:27.85]We got a melee attack.
[178:31.64]Nice.
[178:31.92]Okay, let's talk to Varl now.
[178:33.62]Let's go this way.
[178:42.28]Thank god I actually got this now.
[178:43.65]Hacked the horse.
[178:45.07]Good.
[178:50.96]Is there a jump?
[178:53.27]I should try overriding other kinds of machines.
[178:56.13]Probably can't ride them all, but I might find it useful.
[178:58.71]I need to go this way.
[178:59.61]Like, what is with this fucking GPS tracker?
[179:06.45]Alright.
[179:10.26]What else can I do?
[179:11.92]I can, like, turn his butt to people.
[179:14.36]Okay.
[179:17.12]I can shoot while mounted.
[179:19.64]That's cool.
[179:24.05]I like.
[179:28.17]This is literally Shadow of Mordor.
[179:34.18]What the hell?
[179:34.62]Did he just do that to my mount?
[179:38.94]What happened to the mount?
[179:43.90]Can I play the game yet?
[179:47.75]I got to ride a goat for fucking 30 seconds, and now we're talking again.
[179:53.66]What the fuck?
[179:56.74]What the?
[179:57.20]Come on.
[179:57.82]Get on this mount and go try- No, just talk to this guy over here for a minute.
[180:01.48]Talk to this guy.
[180:02.38]The trail is dangerous.
[180:03.32]We have no war chief to lead us.
[180:14.61]Okay, like... Yeah.
[180:15.24]Shadow of Mordor, you're forcing me to cut scenes the whole game.
[180:21.18]But you still get to play a game!
[180:33.85]How long is this game?
[180:38.45]I'll tell you right now, if we're in like a game sucks situation, I'll tell you right now.
[180:43.23]How long is this game?
[180:47.13]Like, in a general casual playthrough.
[180:51.17]How long is this game?
[180:57.41]Is this game like 15 hours long?
[181:04.86]The game is a third over.
[181:07.14]No, it's not.
[181:08.62]Don't say that.
[181:14.81]It's long.
[181:17.37]It's, like, 20 to 30 hours.
[181:18.63]It's, like, about, like, 30 hours.
[181:21.03]Okay.
[181:21.49]Okay, good.
[181:23.25]I was gonna say, if this was, like, a 12 or 15 hour game, I would've been, like, very, very upset by it.
[181:30.60]Just get this... How do I get off this bounce?
[181:35.63]How do I get off the mount?
[181:36.91]Just, like, GT it.
[181:43.49]No, I want to pick up this shit on the ground.
[181:44.81]I want to activate this bonfire.
[181:55.57]I'm still being taught basic mechanics, yeah.
[181:57.85]It's probably about, like, I would say it's probably, like, 50 hours long.
[182:04.43]Alright, well, if that's the case, then cool.
[182:06.63]Then I'm alright with this.
[182:07.61]But holy shit, that's 985.
[182:12.83]Look, see what it was when I first looked at it?
[182:15.30]It's a sign.
[182:17.64]It's a sign to end the stream.
[182:21.06]985.
[182:21.64]No.
[182:22.38]Let's get to there and see where we are.
[182:23.82]Well, let me pick up all this shit.
[182:24.80]There's a ton of stuff over here.
[182:29.83]There's a lot of shit over here.
[182:32.17]Let's go pick it.
[182:34.16]Is she a son of a bitches?
[182:36.16]What did she just say?
[182:38.34]Sons of bitches.
[182:43.20]It's like 44 hours for a completionist.
[182:46.60]Well, whatever.
[182:47.19]I'm gonna stream this game on Thursday.
[182:55.61]I am.
[182:57.49]I think I am.
[182:58.31]Because I feel like we've weathered the storm here.
[183:00.81]Oh, a quest!
[183:01.78]A quest!

[183:50.72]Do I want to find the groundskeeper really though?
[183:53.08]Do I really want to do that though?
[183:56.44]Uh... Wow.
[184:02.44]Look at this.
[184:05.38]This is a big fucking world.

[185:58.32]Log pile traps.
[186:02.77]Wish I listened to that cutscene.
[186:05.95]Blast sling?
[186:10.47]What did I just do?
[186:11.09]I just put down like a hot water balloon, like a hot air balloon.
[186:19.06]What, can I move this?
[186:20.74]What does this thing do?
[186:24.58]Okay.
[186:28.02]Well, I believe I lost the trial.
[186:32.89]Oh.
[186:36.10]Okay.
[186:37.92]Can I restart your trial?
[186:39.14]I think we need to restart the trial.
[186:46.39]You're mine now!
[186:51.37]Now what does that do?
[186:55.45]This is embarrassing.
[186:56.42]Well, I'm like, what the...

[187:09.16]Let's start from the save.
[187:12.70]Yeah.
[187:14.04]Fuck this.
[187:16.12]He failed the trial of shooting stationary logs because he's so fucking bored.
[187:28.49]That's why.
[187:31.89]He finally got to play the game for five minutes, and he, like, just fucking got so bored.
[187:35.79]Just jump off the cliff!
[187:36.82]Go!
[187:38.26]Do it!
[187:39.70]Do it!
[187:43.40]Alright, now I know what to do.
[187:44.60]I'm gonna shoot the fucking logs, but, like, how do they come up there?
[187:52.02]How do I, like, I need to, like, attract them up there, right?
[187:53.75]With, like, a rock.
[187:54.31]Throw a rock.
[187:56.41]Oh, no, don't call the fucking dog.
[187:59.41]Up there.
[187:59.93]Go over there.
[188:02.19]Like, one of you idiots just go over there.
[188:10.43]How do I get them to move up here?
[188:12.35]There's only log piles here.
[188:16.77]Like, just lure them?
[188:19.83]Like, eventually you'll come up here, right?
[188:22.55]Okay.
[188:25.90]I guess.
[188:30.04]Well, like, keep going.
[188:35.88]Um.
[188:43.83]Dude, look over there now.
[188:51.47]Got him.
[188:54.09]I really got him.
[188:59.68]Try giving them money.
[189:00.68]Oh, there's one over there too.
[189:01.96]Okay.
[189:02.24]I didn't even notice that.
[189:08.20]Okay, well, let's try to knock them down right... Just do it now.
[189:15.12]I'm trying to shoot the logs.
[189:16.22]Okay, I got him.
[189:20.35]Let's get this one.
[189:22.67]Got him.
[189:23.27]Okay.
[189:25.17]Uh, that's it.
[189:25.97]Give me my money.
[189:31.35]How much money did I make for that?
[189:41.60]Took two days.
[189:49.83]Didn't even need to look.
[189:51.71]Blind, you know what I mean?
[189:52.57]Did he just blind kill two machines?
[189:57.73]Yes, I did.
[189:58.25]I knew where they were going.
[190:00.72]I knew their track.
[190:01.24]No, I thought I was getting the fucking... No, I don't want it.
[190:10.76]I got a box, right?
[190:14.42]I unlocked log 2.
[190:17.22]Log 2 tutorial.
[190:18.62]Alright, I got a blazing sun reward box.
[190:23.74]Metal shards and blaze.
[190:26.33]Blaze, fast travel pack, okay.
[190:30.83]Where's my mount?
[190:37.51]Save it.
[190:38.55]Activate the bonfire.
[190:39.43]Save the game.
[190:41.87]And... Where's the mount?
[190:45.01]Where's my mount?
[190:47.79]Outfits?
[190:48.31]No, no, no, no.
[190:49.41]I just... Where's my little friend?
[190:53.43]He's like all the way over there?
[190:55.59]I don't understand.
[190:58.95]He's down here.
[191:01.17]What is he doing all the way down here?
[191:02.25]He should have been up with me.
[191:08.56]Alright, let's go.
[191:09.72]Talk to Mirror at the Mother's Crown.
[191:11.04]We're not doing any more dumb log games.
[191:15.54]I'm getting the hell out of here.
[191:17.68]Oh, I really should.
[191:19.88]Wait, hold on.
[191:24.51]Is this Red Dead Redemption?
[191:25.49]No, but when the new Red Dead Redemption comes out, when they finally release that shit, you better believe I'm going to be playing the hell out of that on stream.
[191:36.17]There is, there, that's correct, there is no next.
[191:38.33]This was what I was doing tonight.
[191:40.13]This was the plan tonight.
[191:42.77]So.
[191:44.27]We're gonna do it.
[191:46.19]At least for a little while.
[191:47.01]What time is it, like, been going for like three or four hours or so, so far?
[191:51.45]Top ten worst Jerma streams.
[191:53.13]What?
[191:55.07]Uh, no fucking way.
[191:55.98]I can name you at least like five other Jerma streams that were a thousand times worse than this.
[192:04.53]Like, I can name you one that happened, like, three days ago.
[192:06.71]Like, four days ago.
[192:09.09]Like, on, like, Tuesday.
[192:11.81]No, no, no.
[192:12.51]Go.
[192:15.93]Turn the corner here.
[192:16.85]Let's just see.
[192:17.27]Let's see what this is and see if I'm gonna continue playing tonight.
[192:19.53]You know?
[192:21.81]We've had our fun.
[192:24.35]That's why it's still in the tent.
[192:27.61]No, fuck this.
[192:28.50]I don't wanna... Get off.
[192:35.87]Red Dead Redemption won't have a four-hour tutorial.
[192:38.48]I hope not.
[192:44.52]I've enjoyed this stream.
[192:45.96]This has been, like, a lot of fun for me.
[192:49.23]Wait, there's, like, a thing here.
[192:52.13]Maybe I can scan it.
[192:59.18]No, I don't want to talk to this guy.
[193:02.09]I wanted to pick up the stuff that... He killed a bunch of shit and I wanted to take money from him.
[193:07.81]None of these quests.
[193:08.83]Give me the rare materials that are on this.
[193:15.19]Skate 3 is not the worst because it never happened.
[193:17.18]That's true, Mac.
[193:18.06]That's true.
[193:19.62]I've never played Skate 3.
[193:24.71]Side quest tutorial.
[193:26.41]How much longer am I going to stream?
[193:28.23]Maybe like another 20 minutes.
[193:29.89]Let's get to the, see what this is.
[193:31.15]And see if we're still in the tutorial.
[193:33.49]And then I'm going to, we'll gauge if I'm going to play this again on Thursday.
[193:45.56]It's a very beautiful area though.
[193:50.73]The actual world is fantastic looking.
[193:54.68]It's very great.
[193:55.36]It's very interesting.
[193:57.38]But... I just wish there was more video game in these first three or four hours.
[194:04.91]I really do.
[194:08.65]But then again, I'm very impatient.
[194:11.69]And... I... I guess I wasn't prepared for this.
[194:18.16]From all the trailers and all the... Like, all, like, the E3 videos.
[194:21.72]All the things I've seen on this game made it seem like it was a very action-intense oriented video game.
[194:27.28]Not necessarily, like, a generic coming-of-age four-hour story for the first beginning of the game.
[194:35.29]And, I mean, whatever.
[194:36.41]It's alright.
[194:36.83]Like, I'm...
[194:39.94]This game's a long game.
[194:41.16]It's a game you buy and you set yourself into the long haul.
[194:46.12]Not necessarily the short term.
[194:48.50]But, you know.
[194:50.66]Mounts can't enter.
[194:51.44]Why?
[194:52.14]Not fair.
[194:55.32]Would I play Yakuza?
[194:56.20]I actually would play Yakuza 0 and I was actually going to buy it.
[194:59.44]Because I feel like it would be a lot of fun.
[195:00.56]Come here, girl.
[195:05.83]And I really hope that we're not doing another cutscene right now.
[195:08.75]We are, of course we are.
[195:10.75]Why wouldn't it be a cutscene?
[195:12.59]This game isn't that long.
[195:14.75]Yeah, there's the video title, Kalem.
[195:16.73]Horizon Tutorial Dawn.
[195:17.39]Ha ha ha.
[195:34.49]I'm good with the bow.
[195:38.03]Um, time for me to go.
[195:48.30]Okay.
[195:51.96]Clear corrupted zones.
[195:53.08]Here we go!
[195:55.46]Clear corrupted zones.
[195:56.74]I think we're gonna get some video game here.
[196:01.14]Looks like we're gonna get a little bit of video game here.
[196:04.69]I'm looking for it.
[196:06.87]Fast travel.
[196:07.79]I wonder if there's anything I can do.
[196:10.16]Well, there's nothing there.
[196:13.84]Why is it telling me to fast travel when I don't even have an opportunity to?
[196:25.40]Where is he?
[196:27.53]I don't understand.
[196:28.47]I can't get by there.
[196:31.23]He's going all the way around.
[196:34.25]I'm coming!
[196:35.19]I'm coming!
[196:36.53]I'm coming!
[196:40.05]Come on, Epona.
[196:41.37]Let's go.
[196:50.08]Well, let's go check out this one.
[196:56.30]Let's check it out.
[197:00.61]It's heavy.
[197:01.69]What's going on?
[197:03.23]Is he gonna go over here or what?
[197:05.73]Can I even go over here?
[197:07.23]Am I stuck down here?
[197:09.81]Oh, god damn it.
[197:12.28]Come on, go!
[197:14.38]No, I'm stuck on this little island now, and he won't leave.
[197:18.80]I have royally fucked myself.
[197:23.16]He's not gonna leave this.
[197:26.28]Nope.
[197:27.20]Yeah.
[197:28.40]I think I may have screwed myself.
[197:32.47]Well, enjoy the island, horse.
[197:36.90]Come on!
[197:37.80]Go!
[197:39.32]Go!
[197:39.72]Yep.
[197:47.21]Okay, well... Try going over... If I call you, will you come over here?
[197:53.21]I can't even climb up this.
[197:56.58]I can't even climb this.
[197:57.68]No, I can jump out of the water like a fucking Spider-Man, but I can't climb off that.
[198:01.00]Alright, now get over here.
[198:05.76]Oh, God.
[198:12.45]How did this happen?
[198:16.07]No, mounts aren't allowed inside the fucking town for no reason.
[198:22.40]Mounts can't reach your current location.
[198:24.04]Well, he's fucked.
[198:24.94]Now I'm sliding down.
[198:29.65]Get on the bridge.
[198:33.31]He's stuck there forever.
[198:34.44]It's over.
[198:37.08]Come on.
[198:38.48]Get up here.
[198:43.38]How did I do this?
[198:48.04]I don't even know how I did that.
[198:52.24]That's like an almost impossibility to do that, right?
[198:59.69]No, he's... whatever.
[199:02.79]Okay, bye, mount.
[199:05.13]Thanks for playing.
[199:07.03]Will you actually go that way?
[199:16.52]Come on.
[199:17.98]No, he's... Come on!
[199:25.71]It's not gonna happen.
[199:26.29]I'm done.
[199:28.07]I'm just walking.
[199:29.35]Fuck it.
[199:35.03]It's right here anyways.
[199:36.03]Alright, can he... Thank God.
[199:43.88]Thank God his brain is that small.
[199:49.51]Alright, clear the corrupted zones.
[199:52.35]Let me scan these motherfuckers.
[199:54.75]On their backs, they're weak to fire.
[199:56.71]Clear a corrupted zone.
[200:03.71]Sure.
[200:28.72]What the fuck just happened?
[200:33.08]What was that?
[200:39.05]I burnt the canisters on its back and it exploded.
[200:41.91]Like in a blaze of fire.
[200:47.21]Okay, well...
[200:54.39]Let's do that a couple more times.
[200:57.86]That's it.
[200:58.54]Alright.
[201:00.88]Cool.
[201:03.42]Weak to fire.
[201:04.08]They explode.
[201:10.51]Sneak around a little bit.
[201:14.89]Make some more fire ammo.
[201:16.80]Let's get 20 because these things obviously...
[201:22.54]Not anymore.
[201:23.00]One?
[201:24.00]One guy?
[201:30.42]No, turn around.
[201:32.87]Well, it exploded on me, but it's still dead.
[201:40.31]There's one more corrupted zone.
[201:45.72]Sure.
[201:46.90]Got new skills.
[201:50.01]I'm going to wait.
[201:50.95]Let's see.
[201:51.65]Double shot.
[201:52.17]I want double shot.
[201:55.15]We're going to wait.
[201:55.83]I need three points for this.
[201:58.58]Requires heavy lifter.
[202:00.98]Wait a minute.
[202:05.02]Oh, shit.
[202:05.94]Okay.
[202:07.74]Let's get this.
[202:09.24]We're going down brave.
[202:12.34]So now I can get this when I have three.
[202:16.80]So now, we're going for heavy weapons, right?
[202:19.20]I guess we have to.
[202:20.76]And then we're gonna do double shot and of course triple shot.
[202:25.46]We have one point, might as well use it.
[202:34.91]Yeah, this one.
[202:39.81]Alright, the other cut's down here.
[202:41.71]Let's call the horse.
[202:46.54]Make our way to the next one.
[202:51.73]So how do you... I'm assuming I have to buy a heavy bow, right?
[202:55.23]That would make sense.
[203:04.54]Although I should really fill up on health.
[203:12.36]I don't want to override those ones.
[203:15.12]What a good horsey.
[203:16.32]I know.
[203:17.20]This is like one.
[203:17.78]This is a brainless random enemy.
[203:20.64]I just decided to mount.
[203:24.11]I would stop, but I have like fucking 10 people chasing me right now.
[203:27.05]That's probably not a good idea.
[203:31.37]A lot of these things out at night.
[203:32.86]Jesus.
[203:37.08]What?
[203:37.72]Don't you guys understand the World of Warcraft rule?
[203:40.62]The roads are supposed to be safe.
[203:43.44]I'm supposed to be able to go on the roads.
[203:46.70]Like, what the fuck?
[203:47.90]I wanna go on the roads.
[203:49.00]It should be safe on the roads.
[203:51.38]So many of these things I can pick up.
[203:57.51]Don't go in the water again.
[203:58.53]Don't fuck yourself like that.
[204:06.51]Up here?
[204:08.05]No, down... This updated GPS... I don't like how the GPS updates.
[204:12.49]Gives me, like, anxiety.
[204:13.55]Just pick up all this shit.
[204:35.63]Stranglethorn.
[204:36.61]I know, not in Stranglethorn.
[204:38.55]That's true.
[204:40.43]That is true.
[204:41.03]Wait, that's one of those.
[204:41.69]Oh, that's a fucking Snaticat.
[204:42.85]I gotta get out of here.
[204:45.54]Watch out for the fucking Snaticat bug.
[204:48.34]No, fucking idiot.
[204:49.06]Come on, I need this.
[204:53.56]Now I can go.
[204:53.90]Let's go.
[204:55.72]Whoa!
[204:56.34]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[204:57.66]There's too many.
[204:58.18]There's like three of these fucking giant bugs.
[205:00.61]I'm dead.
[205:02.25]I'm dead.
[205:10.76]I just got ping-ponged.
[205:11.98]I just instantly got ping-pong killed.
[205:17.75]Are you fucking kidding me?
[205:22.42]Where am I?
[205:26.02]Thank God.
[205:28.52]No, I wanted to call the horse.
[205:30.48]Fuck.
[205:31.91]What a pain in the ass.
[205:37.03]Get good.
[205:38.72]Aloy, I need you to get good.
[205:43.20]Should have used the stealth swimming.
[205:44.74]I know, really.
[205:46.32]Let me break.
[205:46.98]Okay, so the roads aren't safe.
[205:50.64]Good to know.
[205:51.52]I'm not stopping for anything, by the way.
[205:56.49]Fill up on this shit.
[205:57.73]Get, like, multiple ones of these.
[205:59.67]Okay, we're good.
[206:02.13]Cut across here.
[206:06.58]As long as I keep moving, I'm going to be fine.
[206:11.07]Just get off the road.
[206:14.33]Snaticats can smell fear.
[206:16.75]There was a purple right there.
[206:21.23]That was like a rare item.
[206:23.19]Right?
[206:24.81]That's a rare item.
[206:25.63]I have to do it.
[206:27.79]Just grab it, whatever the fuck it is.
[206:32.15]So many lights.
[206:33.71]There's so many fucking LEDs.
[206:36.59]I don't know what that is.
[206:37.63]Metal flower.
[206:38.31]I got it.
[206:38.81]I got a metal flower.
[206:43.27]Mark one.
[206:43.85]Come over here.
[206:47.23]Let's go.
[206:50.09]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[206:51.54]Don't run into a tree.
[206:53.00]Go!
[206:54.40]Go, please.
[206:55.96]This way.
[207:05.64]Go this way.
[207:08.48]Don't get spotted by those giant things.
[207:10.22]Go all the way around.
[207:14.48]Alright, are we fast enough that we can just go by them?
[207:23.00]I think so.
[207:29.59]What about up?
[207:31.49]Yeah.
[207:34.55]Sounds good.
[207:39.78]Okay, chill out right here.
[207:41.04]I got plenty of ammo.
[207:46.99]Here's the other corrupted zone.
[207:48.25]Let me just fill up on medicine.
[207:51.33]Or at least heal a little.
[208:00.83]Okay.
[208:02.11]Use a notebook.
[208:06.59]Alright, so it seems like... What's all this shit all over the ground?
[208:11.57]What's all this red shit?
[208:20.06]Bonfire right here is a good quicksave.
[208:23.72]Save it.
[208:24.00]There we go.
[208:28.46]Alright.
[208:29.36]That's that.
[208:31.84]We're in the corrupted zone right now.
[208:34.20]Just need to kill some shit.
[208:37.34]These guys are weak.
[208:40.70]Where are these guys weak?
[208:43.86]On their ass.
[208:49.07]Got it.
[208:50.25]Got it right in the back.
[208:56.25]He's lit up right now.
[208:59.45]Oh, Jesus.
[209:01.29]Oh, Jesus!
[209:01.93]He's fast.
[209:13.79]One more of those, come on.
[209:16.33]Wow!
[209:17.15]I'm like dead already.
[209:18.18]I'm dead.
[209:19.62]I'm fucking dead.
[209:22.48]I got hit twice and fucking insta-died.
[209:26.72]Holy shit.
[209:29.82]Why does this bow suck so much?
[209:33.90]I'm not even hurting these people.
[209:35.40]Am I supposed to be doing more damage?
[209:41.99]Does that make any sense?
[209:49.13]Why am I doing, like, 15 damage?
[210:02.96]Like, am I missing something?
[210:05.85]Or should I be doing more than 30 damage?
[210:08.41]Like, 23 damage?
[210:10.43]What the fuck is going on?
[210:13.91]Is this like a high level area that I'm not supposed to be in?
[210:16.05]I mean, I guess that's a better idea.
[210:24.61]There's so many of them.
[210:28.55]How the fuck am I supposed to handle this?
[210:30.17]I need to like upgrade my shit.
[210:36.72]My shit sucks.
[210:45.44]My weapon sucks ass.
[211:16.89]I gotta upgrade my shit.
[211:18.01]I really do.
[211:20.27]This is like I'm just being like silent trying to do this.
[211:24.01]Hold on.
[211:26.12]Hold on.
[211:26.96]Let me look at my menu.
[211:28.38]What if I just melee?
[211:30.74]Let's go for fucking melee attacks.
[211:31.90]That's it.
[211:34.80]Why would you ever use the bow?
[211:37.78]What the fuck is the point of the bow in this game?
[211:39.94]You just slash people with your sword.
[211:44.54]Maybe that's why, because you'd fucking die.
[211:52.20]R1, right?
[211:52.66]There you go.
[211:54.32]Well, I definitely don't have enough healing for this.
[211:57.54]No, I gotta move.
[211:59.50]I gotta move.
[212:00.54]Of course, I'm stuck in a fucking wall.
[212:03.01]Healing, healing, healing, healing, healing, healing.
[212:05.93]Not healing.
[212:06.29]I don't think I was necessarily prepared for this, by the way.
[212:15.26]I need more, like, roots.
[212:17.64]Fuck.
[212:18.02]It's like a... It's like a... It's like a... Alien bug dinosaur.
[212:27.99]Who knows what the fuck it is.
[212:29.05]I love how, like, they throw... Like, this is now the game.
[212:35.07]And now I can't hurt anything.
[212:37.61]And I'm just, like, standing in... Like, what is going on?
[212:40.07]I don't want to fucking manually save.
[212:41.51]Okay.
[212:45.22]Why does it have to put me right here?
[212:50.08]Because now they're all coming at me.
[212:53.99]I thought that was a bad guy.
[212:54.85]That's my horse.
[212:58.91]My horse is just, like, sprinting around in a circle.
[213:00.67]Alright, he dead?
[213:02.99]Nice.
[213:05.33]Just instantly fucked that again.
[213:08.49]Somebody, like, sneezed a beam across the map at me and I'm gonna die.
[213:15.52]She's just hanging out here.
[213:16.98]She walked in because she saw me, like, just dicking around.
[213:21.73]The four-hour tutorial and, like, the first mission that I do, like, now I'm just blind.
[213:28.43]What's going on?
[213:28.79]What's wrong with me?
[213:30.99]Thank God my fucking horse is here fighting.
[213:34.27]Do I have any, like, soup I can drink?
[213:37.98]I think I have to upgrade the staff or something.
[213:40.10]Who knows?
[213:40.54]I would love to...
[213:45.11]critical hit come on kill him sneezed a beam yeah I saw the video come on that's actually a very good strategy though I just don't think I'm gonna be able to kill this last one a whole lot of red on my screen
[214:10.16]To be fair, your tutorial goes on for three fucking hours, chances are you didn't design it.
[214:15.88]I don't know.
[214:16.58]And no, I didn't get the switch because Jeremy told me not to.
[214:20.58]Well, apparently it's... Hey, have you guys heard this shit?
[214:23.98]Have you seen this?
[214:24.42]Have you heard about this?
[214:26.18]Somebody was saying all the switches are, like, fucked up?
[214:30.15]Like, the switches are, like, broken?
[214:31.89]Like, out of the box or something?
[214:32.95]Like, what does that mean?
[214:35.23]I gotta be really fucking careful that I don't die here, by the way.
[214:40.37]One hit and I'm dead.
[214:40.97]Oh, come on.
[214:42.13]How did you die?
[214:43.51]No, don't say that.
[214:45.09]I've been doing this for f***ing too long.
[214:51.23]I loved DC.
[214:51.69]It was great.
[214:52.21]Thank you for asking.
[214:54.20]Don't f***ing die here.
[214:55.22]Alright.
[214:55.82]Level 10 reached.
[214:56.58]Oh, come on.
[214:57.26]Just die already.
[214:58.20]No, I won.
[214:59.90]Oh.
[215:00.18]Yeah, so what are people talking about?
[215:02.96]Every console launch has issues.
[215:04.24]Yeah, but an extremely small amount.
[215:07.06]Somebody showed me a picture on Twitter of their screen all f***ed up.
[215:13.37]Where's my horse?
[215:14.31]Did my horse die?
[215:15.17]Yeah, he did.
[215:18.43]My poor horse is dead.
[215:19.23]He's not a bad boyfriend.
[215:20.03]Hey, I'm a good BF.
[215:23.25]He's a good BF.
[215:26.09]He's a good partner.
[215:27.82]I'm a good partner in crime.
[215:30.04]The Switch had a cheapo dock that fucked up the screen and the hardware itself was faulty.
[215:33.82]Really.
[215:34.98]He's the peanut butter to my jelly.
[215:37.41]Yeah, we're a sandwich.
[215:38.99]But sometimes, though, sometimes you put too much jelly on that sandwich.
[215:41.65]You know what I mean?
[215:42.13]Sometimes it's too much peanut butter.
[215:44.37]Gotta be careful with that shit.
[215:45.25]You gotta be careful with too much peanut butter.
[215:47.89]I just killed a fox.
[215:50.95]During that whole thing, I just murdered a fox.
[215:54.59]Worst boyfriend.
[215:55.65]Um, how am I... Why am I dead?
[216:00.78]Big fuck boy.
[216:02.64]I am not a... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[216:03.82]Alright, you know what?
[216:05.04]Mute.
[216:06.45]She's out of here.
[216:07.45]Mute.
[216:08.11]Call me a fuck... Wait, that's it.
[216:16.95]Wait, when I get to this... I think I'm going to stop it.
[216:22.01]I'm going to call it here.
[216:22.85]I'm here.
[216:26.90]I'm ready.
[216:27.32]I don't know if I'm going to stream this on Thursday.
[216:30.22]I have no fucking idea.
[216:31.70]Did you not like the game?
[216:33.12]No, the game's good.
[216:33.70]It's just a very, very long, like, intro, like, tutorial mission.
[216:37.95]But... I'm going to just call it here.
[216:41.97]I'm kind of getting tired.
[216:43.39]And maybe on Thursday I will try this again.
[216:45.69]I feel like I'm just barely out of the tutorial.
[216:48.51]So, hey, fucking four-hour tutorial stream.
[216:51.24]I hope you guys were happy with that.
[216:53.02]We have taco night, so it's waiting for him.
[216:55.14]I got to eat my tacos.
[216:56.78]She came down to tell me that, like, tacos are ready.
[216:58.62]And I'm just like, well, fucking I'm trying to do my tutorial.
[217:02.88]24 hour stream.
[217:03.54]No, I ain't doing one of those.
[217:04.94]I ain't fucking doing that.
[217:06.83]No, no, no.
[217:07.31]Yakuza 0?
[217:08.13]Absolutely.
[217:08.57]Yakuza 0 is on the list of things I want to do for sure.
[217:14.65]Straight up say I don't like it.
[217:15.79]I can't say that though because I haven't been able to play the fucking thing.
[217:19.51]I cannot say I don't like this game.
[217:21.17]I can't.
[217:22.27]Because I'm just barely getting into the meat of the game and I don't know if that's the case or not.
[217:26.73]Oh shit, I just realized it's Tuesday.
[217:28.72]Taco Tuesday.
[217:31.24]Yeah, of course.
[217:32.00]That's why they're like saying tutorial to fucking tutorial taco Tuesday.
[217:35.30]Alright, guys.
[217:37.80]I'll see you all on Thursday.
[217:41.15]And I want to do the fucking movie stream, but who knows if that's going to happen or not.
[217:45.73]I have to prepare.
[217:46.85]Yeah, there's a lot of fucking things I have to do.
[217:50.14]God dang it.
[217:51.10]Why can't there be more hours in a day?
[217:53.89]Buy the Switch and play Breath of the Wild.
[217:55.25]I want to play other games besides that.
[217:57.77]I feel like that's something I wouldn't really want to stream.
[218:01.19]I'd want to play Fast Draw Showdown in real life.
[218:07.28]Who knows?
[218:08.98]What happened to Take Me Back Tuesday?
[218:11.30]We're on Take Me Back Tuesday.
[218:13.65]Who knows?
[218:15.31]Alright.
[218:16.47]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[218:17.51]Thanks for sticking around.
[218:18.55]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[218:21.03]Sorry that it was like a four-hour tutorial, but I think we had fucking fun.
[218:24.23]I had a blast.
[218:25.07]This was a fun stream for me.
[218:27.49]I'm not sure if I'll do this on Thursday or Friday.
[218:29.48]I don't know.
[218:29.90]It depends.
[218:30.46]I might play for another two hours off stream and be like, you know what?
[218:35.14]Am I going to fucking play this game or not?
[218:36.56]I don't know.
[218:37.86]But good night.
[218:38.50]Thanks, everybody.
[218:39.02]Good luck.
[218:39.52]I'll talk to you on Thursday.
[218:41.06]Bye.
[218:41.38]Goodbye.
[218:55.23]you
