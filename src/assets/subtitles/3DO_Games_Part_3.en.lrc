[00:01.30]Good afternoon.
[00:01.76]Good afternoon.
[00:02.44]Sorry I'm late.
[00:03.14]Sorry.
[00:04.10]Something came up last second that I just have to take care of.
[00:06.36]Take care of it.
[00:09.85]Everything's good.
[00:11.75]We're ready to go.
[00:12.27]Sorry I was late.
[00:14.57]Sorry.
[00:17.69]Don't apologize.
[00:18.75]Welcome.
[00:19.19]Hey.
[00:21.70]Thank you.
[00:22.34]Hey.
[00:23.06]Look at that.
[00:23.42]When are we going to do porn week?
[00:26.22]I don't know.
[00:31.14]That's every week, man.
[00:35.02]Keep apologizing.
[00:39.38]Where is New Vegas?
[00:40.56]What do you mean New Vegas?
[00:42.30]Like Fallout New Vegas?
[00:44.78]Are you trying to tell me to continue a playthrough of a game that I stopped four years ago?
[00:50.98]During my do I like live streaming trial period?
[00:57.58]Yes.
[00:57.88]Yes.
[01:00.63]You know what's kind of funny?
[01:02.47]I bet that same save file is still here.
[01:07.37]I could probably open it and I'd be sitting at the door that we were at four years ago.
[01:11.12]Should I just open it and pretend like it's been not even a day?
[01:13.48]Okay, so last week we were here.
[01:18.18]Pretty cool adventure so far.
[01:20.88]I would have no idea where I was even going.
[01:22.48]I can't do that.
[01:24.90]Hello, welcome.
[01:25.54]We're gonna be doing, uh, I did a poll before the stream started.
[01:29.25]We're gonna be doing Psychic Detective.
[01:32.75]It is a meaty 3DO game.
[01:36.23]It is an FMV adventure, from what I understand.
[01:40.55]Heard it's crazy.
[01:43.31]And you know how much we love our FMV games on this channel.
[01:46.54]You know it as much as I do.
[01:47.92]This game is three discs long.
[01:53.76]Which back in the mid nineties, a three to four disk game was like every Lord of the Rings movie back to back.
[02:04.21]That was a huge amount of stuff.
[02:05.59]It was insane to know that that was the case.
[02:07.17]If a game had more than one disk, you knew you were in for it.
[02:09.65]This is a new mic?
[02:16.53]No, I'm just sitting a little closer.
[02:21.38]Look out, Jerma.
[02:22.04]This could be a porn game.
[02:24.29]It's not a porn game.
[02:25.37]It's a detective game.
[02:28.57]It's not a porn game.
[02:30.03]Turn your facecam on.
[02:34.89]Don't have any clothes on?
[02:36.10]Don't have a facecam.
[02:38.08]Sorry, guys.
[02:39.38]Just imagine what I look like right now.
[02:46.64]There's a couple other games that are FMVs that I cannot wait to play on this ancient dinosaur device of a console.
[02:53.19]I'm not going to tell you what they are.
[02:59.51]You'll experience them with me as we do.
[03:05.07]Psychic porn.
[03:07.41]Alright, let's go.
[03:08.11]Psychic Detective, welcome everybody.
[03:12.27]this will be I do want to say this though as of today we're going to put a little cool down period on the 3dl in the last three streams in a row so we're going to put the 3do away for a week or so we'll come back to it it's always here it's available we'll do something else this coming week alright let's go psychic detective
[03:35.88]Oh, by the way, I want to make sure I start saying this more frequently.
[03:38.82]FTK is not canceled.
[03:41.97]FTK is going to happen on October 3rd.
[03:45.21]That is the date for it.
[03:46.83]October 3rd.
[03:52.27]I think I mentioned the 26th before, but no.
[03:54.14]No, no, no, no.
[03:54.92]October 3rd, 3pm Pacific.
[03:56.44]It is not canceled.
[03:57.76]It is not canceled.
[04:01.36]I saw you on my recommended on my fir- Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[04:05.58]Saw you on my recommended.
[04:06.84]This is my first stream.
[04:08.14]Pog.
[04:11.32]Can we get a warm welcome for Pointster?
[04:13.29]This is their first stream ever.
[04:19.33]Phantom.
[04:21.19]Hey, welcome to your first stream ever.
[04:29.24]That's the pog.
[04:29.80]We, and by the way, we do this for all new viewers.
[04:36.41]He doesn't know that we do this for everybody.
[04:40.15]Are you ready to sing the welcome song?
[04:43.17]Okay, here we go, guys.
[04:44.33]You know it.
[04:44.71]You guys know the lyrics.
[04:45.45]You guys start.
[04:46.21]You start.
[04:46.73]You guys do it first.
[04:47.55]Here we go at the same time.
[04:48.94]Ready?
[04:52.25]Hey, I know you're new.
[04:53.49]Welcome to the stream.
[04:55.45]Pull up a chair.
[04:56.77]It's quite the dream.
[04:59.05]It's your first time here.
[05:00.71]Oh, what a joy!
[05:03.31]But don't act like the stream is a toy.
[05:08.79]You... Alright, fuck that.
[05:10.43]Let's go.
[05:15.77]No signal?
[05:24.67]Okay, you know what's really funny?
[05:26.15]Can I go off?
[05:26.91]I'm gonna go off right now.
[05:29.59]Do you know how exhausting it would probably be for every new follower or every new subscriber if I had to sing that fucking song?
[05:40.27]I would look over and there would be a new sub or something and I'd be like, oh wait, there's ten new subs.
[05:47.55]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[05:49.13]It's just you and I. So, he's gone.
[05:53.25]No, he didn't leave.
[05:55.17]He actually left.
[05:56.03]No, he didn't.
[05:56.53]He's here.
[05:59.51]You're gonna get a personal song sung about you and leave?
[06:03.28]No, I didn't.
[06:07.36]He didn't leave.
[06:07.86]That was a personal directed, like, welcome song.
[06:13.56]Actually, that's kind of weird.
[06:14.54]I probably would fucking leave, too.
[06:15.70]I'd probably leave.
[06:17.44]If I came into a stream and I was like, hey, my first time here, and it was like, hey, Jerma, welcome to my new stream.
[06:22.92]You're a new guy.
[06:24.43]Everybody sing him the song.
[06:25.67]It would be like, I'm fucking out of here, man.
[06:27.19]I just want to relax and just watch TV and eat, like, french fries.
[06:29.33]Like, fuck you.
[06:34.65]Like, stop talking to me.
[06:36.41]I just want to watch the stream, man.
[06:40.35]I've so overdone it to this person at this point that now, like, they probably, I would, they're back.
[06:48.81]This is the most overdone new viewer experience.
[06:55.04]Okay, let's go.
[06:56.92]It's time for psychic detective.
[07:01.22]I have two different drinks here.
[07:02.52]Does that make me a psycho?
[07:07.31]Does that make me a weird person?
[07:11.33]Yes.
[07:14.15]Movie?
[07:14.55]Wait, what do you mean movie?
[07:15.40]Movie.
[07:18.36]Why does it say movie?
[07:26.68]Is this a movie?
[07:28.20]No, this is a video game, man.
[07:29.70]Electronic Arts and colossal pictures.
[07:44.39]It's a fucking nightmare.
[07:45.57]The world is yours to control.
[07:49.19]That's a load of crap.
[07:56.83]What the hell is going on?
[07:58.17]I need to turn the... Hey, if I could predict the future, there'd be a few less dead bodies.
[08:12.64]We just got a shot.
[08:16.72]I need to turn the volume up.
[08:17.58]Look at that hair.
[08:18.10]That's my hair.
[08:19.20]He's so close.
[08:20.25]Why are you this close to the audience?
[08:42.46]Your grandfather gave this to you on his deathbed.
[08:45.84]It's the Joker.
[08:47.06]It's just the Joker.
[08:49.62]Very boring for us.
[08:51.44]Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:52.72]Anyone else out there have another...
[08:55.18]Her name was Lena Pozak.
[08:57.48]She looked like an alien.
[08:59.28]She showed me the hell with one shove.
[09:02.81]She sent my whole world spinning out of control.
[09:06.51]She showed me how to transmit my psychic self into the consciousness of others.
[09:11.45]To see through their eyes.
[09:13.33]Hear through their ears.
[09:15.07]The real mind pirate stuff.
[09:17.73]Naturally, there was a price.
[09:23.50]What's with the cat?
[09:24.42]My father just killed himself.
[09:26.56]What?
[09:26.98]Is he psychically detectiving the cat?
[09:29.72]...to a family gathering and be my eyes and ears.
[09:34.12]No, I'm not the mind pirate type.
[09:36.26]I think I can make it worth your while.
[09:38.21]This is going to look like every family feud host.
[09:43.93]Lady, this is only $400.
[09:44.61]What the fuck is this?
[09:46.29]Is that your final offer?
[09:49.17]No.
[09:53.57]Or maybe after we can have another special lesson.
[10:00.85]Alright.
[10:02.47]Deal.
[10:09.38]What's black diamond?
[10:12.08]Some missing necklace?
[10:14.68]Just the game.
[10:17.04]His silly old Russian game.
[10:19.88]His outfit.
[10:21.68]He's like a fucking circus ringleader.
[10:23.68]That's where my father jumped from.
[10:25.54]What?
[10:26.44]Why are we here?
[10:27.08]I tell you, Eric.
[10:29.60]My father was beaten, disgraced.
[10:33.56]But too stubborn to give up like that.
[10:41.07]Wait, we're going in?
[10:41.77]Where are we?
[10:45.55]I'm Eric.
[10:48.51]That's my sister, Monica.
[10:50.62]Where are we?
[10:52.16]Very cute.
[10:53.18]Very weak and gullible.
[10:55.18]Who's the plastic dress?
[10:56.98]Wait, what do I have to touch?
[11:00.26]Maybe you can find out for me.
[11:01.58]And him?
[11:07.63]Why do I feel like we're at, like, dinner for schmucks right now?
[11:11.79]Am I one of the schmucks?
[11:13.53]What?
[11:13.67]Okay, we've got people to talk to?
[11:16.09]Alright, come on.
[11:18.69]No, I wanna talk to- We're going to Moki.
[11:35.71]I just- I totally just totally gotta fuck off.
[11:41.00]Uh-oh.
[11:45.44]That was the scariest landing ever.
[11:47.58]What was that?
[11:55.61]Why are we in this scary house?
[12:04.92]Oh, we're inside of his head!
[12:09.16]We're inside of Moki's head!
[12:11.83]Alright, brass ring.
[12:36.75]Okay, we're looking for a brass ring.
[12:38.53]Should I just stay in?
[12:39.19]Okay, what if I stay in this guy forever?
[12:41.17]Isn't that sweet?
[12:47.49]You put it in the shredder, man.
[12:48.55]You don't just rip it up in three pieces.
[12:49.91]Who?
[12:51.37]What are we looking for?
[12:54.81]A baby?
[12:57.93]Why are we in this guy's head?
[13:01.33]We're just sitting there watching a movie.
[13:04.07]Yeah, that's us down there, right?
[13:08.82]Don't you think you'd puke if you saw yourself walking down the stairs and looked over at yourself, looking at yourself?
[13:13.04]I'd- I'd fucking puke right now.
[13:14.50]I- Monica.
[13:15.42]Oh, okay.
[13:16.42]Oh, back to Bunky.
[13:19.27]No, I- I got an option.
[13:38.45]I have to be like within laser eye distance of them.
[13:42.23]On my head.
[13:44.22]Wait.
[13:44.54]This is what I see.
[13:49.36]Cigar.
[13:54.82]What am I?
[13:55.10]I'm smoking somebody's cigar?
[14:02.36]I must ask you to go.
[14:04.58]Your uncle was a big noise.
[14:06.35]A real player in the old country.
[14:09.24]Did I just get kicked out?
[14:13.60]Oh, that's what I need.
[14:16.79]I want that watch.
[14:20.15]His hand.
[14:20.53]He's got like three hands.
[14:24.21]Chad.
[14:25.35]Oh, what's Chad up to?
[14:26.23]Oh, wait.
[14:33.71]This is the money.
[14:35.89]Chad's got the money.
[14:37.21]Are we Chad?
[14:37.85]I don't know.
[14:38.33]I don't understand.
[14:48.00]What is all this shit this is like an incantation This is just improv class the house, okay, you're gonna walk into a room and I'll give me an object the book okay, and then She
[15:16.06]We're back in Eric's head.
[15:16.88]I don't have any idea what the fuck is going on.
[15:20.72]I...
[15:38.30]Wait, wait!
[15:39.22]Uh, knife!
[15:39.92]Knife!
[15:40.91]Pick up the knife!
[15:41.59]I had one second to look at that!
[15:42.81]I didn't- Oh, wait, I didn't touch anything.
[15:44.23]Chad made a mess.
[15:45.19]We leaving?
[15:45.53]Please insert disk two.
[16:10.98]Okay, let's go ahead and I'm going to put in disk.
[16:13.92]That was a quick, that was very fast.
[16:17.10]So what have we gathered so far?
[16:18.90]Hold on.
[16:19.20]I didn't think I was going to need disk two right now.
[16:22.94]At least like 40 minutes or so.
[16:24.67]Where the fuck are they?
[16:26.49]Where are these disks?
[16:27.31]Alright, what have we gathered?
[16:33.48]So far we've gathered that there's a guy, somebody jumped out of a window.
[16:40.33]And then we all went to a dinner party at their house to find out who did it or something.
[16:46.53]And then somebody gets stabbed.
[16:49.85]There's a ring, there's a watch.
[16:53.68]You know what?
[16:54.04]I have no idea.
[16:56.46]I'm going to put disk two in and we're going to see what happens.
[17:00.96]Can I even get into disk 2?
[17:02.34]There we go.
[17:03.77]Do I have to press a button?
[17:07.23]I don't understand.
[17:09.41]You went through all the FMVs that are available in one disk?
[17:13.79]That seems a little ridiculous.
[17:14.83]12 video files on each disk.
[17:21.42]Alright, let's continue the story.
[17:23.90]A meaty 3DO game.
[17:26.18]This is AI Dungeon.
[17:29.04]Shot for shot.
[17:32.22]What happens next?
[17:32.82]Uh-oh.
[17:42.39]Cops got involved.
[17:46.37]From the puka lounge to multiple stab wound city.
[17:50.03]Courtesy of my libido.
[17:52.36]I made a mental note.
[17:53.70]From now on, only do brunch with these people.
[17:59.46]You sure it was her?
[18:01.04]Yeah, like I had a front row seat.
[18:02.94]But why Chad?
[18:04.92]Your father kept a green notebook?
[18:07.72]Yeah.
[18:08.72]Any idea what was in it?
[18:10.70]Not really.
[18:11.72]Don't play with me, Lena.
[18:12.98]I don't know.
[18:13.58]I feel like I skipped to the middle of the movie.
[18:17.28]I think Chad was going to sell it to the weasel.
[18:20.82]The Sylvia chick had other ideas.
[18:22.04]Did we accidentally do the right outcome?
[18:23.97]Eric, you're better than I could have hoped for.
[18:28.90]okay here we go so are we good night give me those keys I just wanted to take the keys man I just wanted to take the keys you're hiding somebody shut up who is he
[18:55.03]Sergei.
[18:56.81]And Sergei is... Not my lover, not my plaything.
[19:02.47]Just... A poor defenseless man.
[19:08.18]Did I lose?
[19:08.64]Did I touch the keys?
[19:11.60]Poor defenseless man.
[19:13.04]Alright, we're gonna follow her.
[19:26.57]Now what?
[19:26.79]I'm really close.
[19:27.49]Do you notice I'm just following her?
[19:29.45]Does she not look?
[19:30.25]She doesn't know I'm behind her.
[19:32.19]She has no idea that I followed her.
[19:33.83]Okay.
[19:34.09]That was way easier than it even seems to be in like GTA.
[19:36.34]Knock on the door.
[19:57.11]Don't look so surprised.
[19:59.85]I mean, I followed you all the fucking way here.
[20:06.20]What?
[20:06.96]Are you satisfied?
[20:08.66]Did you find all the dirty truth?
[20:10.22]I mean that puppet.
[20:11.72]Let's touch the puppet and see what happened.
[20:14.82]Oh, Kiki.
[20:21.01]Kiki dance.
[20:22.17]Kiki dance.
[20:23.49]Who did this to him?
[20:24.31]What?
[20:26.35]What did she say?
[20:27.77]Vladimir?
[20:28.13]Wait.
[20:28.49]Wait, I can go with somebody.
[20:30.11]Let's go on her head.
[21:02.89]Why is that so funny?
[21:04.51]I guess that you have gerbils that are running on a wheel.
[21:07.65]I guess it's hilarious.
[21:08.69]What the hell is going on?
[21:17.46]Is he... Is he dead?
[21:28.10]Did I just like psychic him to death?
[21:36.90]Wait, isn't that the thing that they keep the bingo balls in?
[21:38.98]I need to find four of these magic cylinders.
[21:42.60]Well, at least we have the actual thing we need to do for the game.
[21:46.78]Don't do it!
[21:47.08]Wait, it's...
[22:13.20]Okay, that's... That's... It's improv.
[22:16.39]It's improv.
[22:17.19]It's improv.
[22:18.75]It's improv.
[22:19.67]It wasn't anything.
[22:20.29]Oh, shit.
[22:20.65]Where do I go?
[22:25.24]Oh, and Max's head.
[22:26.40]There's a little hot shot inside my head.
[22:29.18]Eric Fox.
[22:30.38]That name means nothing to me.
[22:32.02]Friend of Lena's.
[22:33.24]He's leaving fingerprints all over my mind.
[22:35.06]I just changed the channel.
[22:36.12]How can you tell?
[22:37.64]You'd never understand.
[22:39.24]Hey, I'm not all tricked out and psychic, but I'm damn good at what I do.
[22:44.26]Smoked you out, Maximum Savonarvim.
[22:48.02]Go to Eric.
[22:51.06]I'm going to squash you like a sow bug.
[22:56.41]What do you mean what happened?
[22:57.47]Aggression.
[22:57.73]Are those stink lines?
[22:58.63]Is she like smelling my body?
[23:02.17]Wait, that just made her be aggressive.
[23:26.26]I'm sorry.
[23:28.92]But I think... maybe you deserved it.
[23:31.68]What?
[23:33.58]There is a chance to spy, to go anywhere.

[25:28.21]We caught it the first time.
[25:30.72]But when that guy walked in with like two bleeding breasts, we have no idea what happened to him.
[25:38.14]And the guy had a gun.
[25:40.29]We didn't catch it.

[28:09.52]What was the point of being able to jump into him?
[28:12.63]Oh.
[28:12.69]She just pulled me out of that.
[28:13.79]Why is he in jail with me?
[28:15.13]Oh.

[28:49.88]I think we should see how the old woman is doing.
[28:51.86]What do you think?
[28:52.96]I think we forget about her.
[28:54.58]Don't be wicked.
[28:55.80]Papa Vladimir, he hid the fourth collector.
[28:59.60]Am I going to have to put up on discs free?
[29:02.78]How could you?
[29:03.34]Eric.

[29:40.58]Two out of four.
[29:45.05]It was that easy.
[30:11.56]Hey, do you want to get to hold it?
[30:14.76]Can I hold it?
[30:15.24]It's not like a dog that you just got out of the pet store.

[30:46.34]Wait, she's talking to herself?
[30:47.78]Or does she know we're in her head?
[30:49.03]What did you learn?
[30:50.11]We're late.
[30:50.85]The old lady is steamed.
[30:52.17]The old lady?
[30:53.25]The old lady is a pain in the keister.
[30:57.03]Fine.
[30:57.65]We'll give her the precious student.
[30:59.51]Okay, so we're going to go see the old lady.
[31:03.77]Wait.
[31:05.21]There's something I want to try.
[31:08.01]We only need two more of these.
[31:09.03]What are you trying?
[31:12.65]Triangles.
[31:14.39]What is going?
[31:19.80]What's he doing?
[31:22.46]Walk pattern.
[31:35.85]It was Bugleberry.
[31:36.65]It was Bugleberry laughing at somebody at how bad they hated the new carpet that just got delivered.
[31:45.36]What the fuck am I doing?
[31:52.45]It was already open.
[31:53.73]It was clearly already open.
[31:59.74]Case.
[32:00.85]Okay, shards.
[32:01.97]Workbench.
[32:02.73]Let's get the pin.
[32:03.83]Okay, what's with the flashing lights, by the way?
[32:27.78]Where are we?
[32:29.86]Shards.
[32:30.39]More toys, old man?
[32:34.45]Wait, he just broke one.
[32:36.67]Did he just let out one of the spirits?
[32:42.43]Oh, what's that?
[32:45.31]Open workbench.
[32:48.08]You've grown soft, old teacher.
[32:51.20]And I've gotten much, much stronger.
[32:55.78]Can we make you even older?
[32:58.64]Older than Anna?
[33:03.74]Okay, no, go to Madam T. Um, do we go to Madam T?
[33:12.57]Lexi killed your dad.
[33:14.47]Lexi?
[33:15.35]Lexi, Max, same asshole.
[33:21.56]Well, how do you know?
[33:22.56]Why do you think I touch stuff?
[33:24.18]To sniff my fingers?
[33:27.18]What a weird thing to go to first.
[33:28.86]I'm sorry.
[33:30.48]He was here.
[33:31.50]He wanted the fourth collector.
[33:33.87]And he torched the hell out of Vladimir.
[33:35.19]Oh, God.
[33:39.53]Uh-oh.
[33:40.51]Adam T!
[33:43.41]We're too late!
[33:43.99]J-
[33:50.88]What?
[33:51.72]Just for me, Eric.
[33:53.50]Make her twist.
[33:55.76]No!
[33:56.46]Putting a pillow on the old lady's face.
[34:07.15]Oh.
[34:07.49]Find what you can.
[34:08.73]Find what I can.
[34:09.57]Rip her to pieces.
[34:10.59]Feed her.
[34:11.47]Fry her.
[34:15.30]You think you can use me?
[34:18.84]Bend me?
[34:20.66]For practice?
[34:23.04]Get out!
[34:24.42]Oh shit, we blew it.
[34:43.78]Get out before I take a turn.
[34:46.75]You tell your next mirage.
[34:49.13]We are ready.
[34:50.79]I'm sure he's all a tremble.
[34:52.17]Didn't she kill the person?
[34:53.85]Anybody tried to talk to Moki lately?
[34:57.79]What is Moki?
[34:58.81]Uh-oh.
[34:59.91]Uh-oh.
[35:03.19]You know who you play?
[35:06.56]Hiding as the next mirage?
[35:13.38]He's good, isn't he?
[35:14.66]What is this game board?
[35:16.64]Look at the board.
[35:19.82]Did we just get three?
[35:20.86]We got a third one?
[35:29.13]What in the name of... This is no game of checkers and pieces.
[35:34.83]You must pick thoughts, Eric.
[35:37.15]Go on.
[35:39.11]This guy kind of looks like my dad, so I'm just going to pick him.
[35:42.80]Leave him be.
[35:45.00]He is dead.
[35:45.98]How about the skull?
[35:48.26]Cigarette.
[35:50.20]Good, yes.
[35:52.42]If you do not own your fear, Lexi will lose it.
[35:55.64]Um, a shoe.
[35:57.87]Ah, yes.
[35:59.15]Always pick the shoe.
[36:01.45]Vladimir, he love the shoe.
[36:03.95]We play the money game, he's always the shoe.
[36:07.13]How about, and, uh, you?
[36:10.07]As long as I am alive, I am a weapon for you.
[36:14.43]Remember that.
[36:15.85]Cool.
[36:18.19]She's playing her pieces now.
[36:19.51]Is this like auto chess?
[36:21.61]Are they going to fight?
[36:22.30]I don't understand this.
[36:24.80]Who do you attack?
[36:26.42]That is what this is.
[36:28.04]I attack the shoe.
[36:30.08]I'm going to use the shoe to attack this person.
[36:37.44]Got it.
[36:37.90]They are the same.
[36:39.48]Nobody wins till the next move.
[36:41.84]Too bad for you.
[36:43.28]It's my turn.
[36:45.28]Okay.
[36:46.04]So you're gonna go with lady versus dad.
[36:48.24]You killed dad with lady.
[36:49.14]We take turns.
[36:50.75]One of us will lose everything.
[36:52.73]You understand?
[36:54.51]Then go.
[36:55.11]Okay.
[36:55.51]Kill him.
[36:56.79]Bring the bastard to be my lapdog.
[37:00.25]So, what?
[37:02.11]You... Own the fear.
[37:03.81]Find the scar.
[37:04.90]Free the girl.
[37:05.96]Steal the kiss.
[37:07.00]You're a little cocky, I think.
[37:09.72]High noon, babe.
[37:10.40]Big showdown.
[37:11.84]Eric, I don't think you realize... What?
[37:14.99]That I could walk away a fritter?
[37:16.29]That I'm insane to do this?
[37:17.81]What don't I realize?
[37:18.33]This is like Andy Samberg and original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill got fused together.
[37:23.07]Help me up.
[37:23.49]Light a fire.
[37:25.98]I have no one else.
[37:29.56]That really got me rocking.
[37:36.17]I still have no idea what's going on.
[37:38.39]So we now have to do her bidding.
[37:40.63]Join the war on depression.
[37:42.33]That's... Okay.
[37:45.38]I mean, yeah, but that... What's... Back to disk one.
[37:48.34]Holy shit.
[37:53.06]Did we go backwards?
[37:54.30]Let's make sure this is disk one.
[38:01.37]I got it.
[38:03.21]We're in a loop.
[38:04.43]I don't think it's a loop.
[38:09.62]I think they just compiled all the video files alphabetically on each disk.
[38:26.22]Here we go.
[38:35.00]Movie.
[38:45.62]Don't squeeze me out!
[38:47.95]But she's a Corellian.
[38:49.91]And so... Isn't this the guy from Command & Conquer?
[38:55.29]Why'd she just fall down?
[39:08.98]Come on.
[39:12.39]Um, wouldn't she just standing right next to him?
[39:14.85]Wouldn't she do that?
[39:15.85]She went and found a painting of him.
[39:22.65]Why not just punch him in the face?
[39:41.68]I filled her with hate.
[39:42.74]I don't even know.
[39:44.26]I left her alone.
[39:45.08]I'm scared.
[39:45.86]I have no fucking idea.
[39:48.35]I left her for him.
[39:50.53]I saw- I saw like a mazel tov thing and then... What's he doing?
[39:55.57]Let's take him out.
[39:56.71]I wanna go.
[39:57.01]What do you mean take him out?
[39:57.97]Then go, but I'm holding this.
[40:02.96]Maximum me, maximum you.
[40:04.76]Is he like a self-help guru?
[40:12.62]We're just walking into this guy's- he's just crossed-armed, waiting for us.
[40:26.70]This is the kind of reaction you have with the noises you make when you first pull up Odo Booth for the iPad.
[40:45.71]It's true.
[40:46.94]Everybody played their part perfectly.
[40:55.40]This is how you do it.
[40:57.58]No wasted motion.
[40:59.36]No parlor tricks.
[41:00.68]Shoot him.
[41:01.86]Say goodbye to the girl.
[41:03.61]Shoot him.
[41:04.09]Go to the car.
[41:05.97]No.
[41:07.47]Harder.
[41:08.99]Don't you want to see her cry?
[41:10.97]No.
[41:11.98]You think I need your help?
[41:13.76]Oh wait, he's psychic-detectiving me.
[41:15.76]You're a cheerleader, a throw-ruck!
[41:18.02]Now move!
[41:19.90]Go!
[41:20.10]Dammit.
[41:22.05]Good boy.
[41:24.07]Daddy's good boy.
[41:26.35]Nobody wants to burn you.
[41:29.17]Just bring me the toy.
[41:31.79]These are the good times.
[41:36.15]Bad ending.
[41:39.12]The old man knew I was the best.
[41:40.80]There was never any question about that.
[41:43.31]The question was how to keep me happy.
[41:46.17]You can't turn referee into a trendy style.
[41:49.91]I'm sorry.
[41:52.21]I made him look brilliant.
[41:54.69]He surrendered.
[41:57.81]Miss Lena.
[41:59.64]But she is so stubborn.
[42:05.90]And I get so pissed off.
[42:12.02]Oh, not this again.
[42:13.30]Okay, uh, cigarette versus, uh, I don't know, a metronome and Bill Murray versus, and the toy.
[42:27.19]There's no shoe.
[42:28.15]Oh, wait, he had a shoe already.
[42:29.71]Okay, we're gonna go cigarette.
[42:33.84]No, we're gonna go toy onto shoe.
[42:42.38]It's my game now.
[42:44.58]The old man can rot.
[42:47.08]I make the rules.
[42:48.16]It means whatever I want it to mean.
[42:51.54]Okay, we're gonna go, uh... You're a butcher.
[42:59.81]I'm a surgeon.
[43:01.29]Lancing and popping all the little pimples that stain my natural glory.
[43:05.65]So this has been just a psychic fight between the two of us the whole time.
[43:12.88]Hmm, a lot of real estate for a lucky man.
[43:17.16]Sorry, I still have the metronome.
[43:21.00]It blocked.
[43:22.14]Why'd she do it, Max?
[43:23.86]I don't know.
[43:25.02]She gave up.
[43:26.04]She couldn't stand to see you become such a monster.
[43:29.12]No!
[43:33.69]Okay, this is important.
[43:35.81]Metronome versus shoe?
[43:37.17]Or metronome versus lady?
[43:40.55]I don't know.
[43:45.50]Chew.
[43:47.22]Fuck, they canceled each other out.
[43:48.38]Two rocks canceling each other out like smothering a silent stream.
[44:02.11]War.
[44:04.57]You are so handsome.
[44:08.31]So full of blood.
[44:10.53]Of the balls.
[44:13.29]Why are they even playing cards?
[44:14.29]Double war!
[44:16.41]If only I could die.
[44:20.32]I win!
[44:21.28]I win!
[44:22.26]Kiki, I win!
[44:23.66]Kiki!
[44:23.96]Kiki!
[44:25.22]Kiki.
[44:31.15]Okay, so that's a bad ending.
[44:36.11]Pokey's Playmate, The Village Idiot, This Little Piggy, Maximum Eric, Double War, Pooka, Lounge Blues, Lexi's Last Laugh, Change Heads, No Third Chances, Pretty Bracelet, The Healing, Hot Head, The Big Kiss, and The Grand Slam.
[44:50.07]If you turn the menu over, you'll see our list of our beverages.
[44:55.27]And some alcohol you can order as well.
[45:02.09]Started a little bit.
[45:02.93]Fucked that one up a little.
[45:03.73]It's okay.
[45:05.09]Come on!
[45:07.97]Give me that one!
[45:15.43]Did you play Black Diamond with Madame... Tuk... Tikhanov?
[45:21.18]Um... Did I?
[45:28.24]Belvages.
[45:29.10]Yeah, Belvages.
[45:30.14]And now what?
[45:34.15]Is that it?
[45:34.79]Do we do it again?
[45:37.18]Alright, now that I know what's going on, I wanna try and do it again.
[45:45.53]Now that I know what's happening, I wanna try, I wanna do it one more time.
[45:48.44]Do you?
[45:49.08]No, but yes.
[45:56.44]We have to try a separate outcome.
[46:07.97]Here we go.
[46:08.49]We get invited to the dinner party.
[46:10.54]That's my sister, Monica.
[46:17.50]Okay, Monica.
[46:19.56]He was hoping to come in person.
[46:20.88]I don't believe it.
[46:21.93]Your sister doesn't waste much time.
[46:23.65]We have to get into Sylvia's head because we're going to watch her kill the guy.
[46:25.75]Where's Mr. Mirage?
[46:29.03]Meet him at the tea room at 10 o'clock.
[46:30.39]Okay.
[46:31.80]I can change channels, this is just in real time.
[46:34.18]Tea room, 10 o'clock, yep.
[46:35.30]Just a giant twister spitter.
[47:00.66]It's not ready for Twister, you bastard!
[47:02.80]We do that after our dessert drinks.
[47:04.97]Okay, here we go.
[47:05.37]Play Black Diamond with her.
[47:06.25]Yeah, thanks.
[47:27.89]Alright, black diamond.
[47:28.93]Felt like a good time to get acquainted with Dad.
[47:31.69]What worked in the cuckoo room was bound to work around here.
[47:38.95]The house had seen better days.
[47:41.15]Better days, worse days.
[47:43.13]It was just starting to give a big wet kiss to the rotten days.
[47:46.60]And there was stuff all around keeping secrets.
[47:49.78]I wanted to find more.
[47:50.66]Nothing.
[47:52.54]Nothing.
[47:53.82]Nothing.
[47:58.61]Yep, he threw him out the window.
[47:59.57]Yep.
[48:01.43]Alright, we gotta get this- we have to go to Chad.
[48:05.91]Oh wait, this is Chad.
[48:06.55]Alright, stay with Chad.
[48:30.28]She comes in and she stabs him.
[48:41.83]Save him.
[48:42.71]Can I?
[48:44.31]Oh shit, I just jumped onto the game board.
[48:47.73]We're not gonna see Chad die.
[48:56.90]You are bold.
[48:59.60]Disobedient.
[49:02.28]That is good.
[49:03.95]You will need to be reckless.
[49:05.55]This is the Christopher Walken character.
[49:07.03]He was sexy.
[49:11.91]May he rot in hell for all I care.
[49:14.66]What'd he do?
[49:16.88]It's like SNL skit.
[49:17.94]Oh, she's gonna teach me how to play.
[49:20.22]Oh.
[49:43.32]Something has happened.
[49:44.70]Oh, she can sense the murder.
[49:45.84]Who is in this study?
[49:47.30]Sleazy Chad.
[49:48.66]Quickly!
[49:48.98]Go to him!
[49:53.88]What are you doing?
[49:59.94]Should I get out?
[50:00.62]Give me the inkblot.
[50:03.37]Why do we call him Sleazy Chad?
[50:09.21]Can't we just call him Chad?
[50:16.30]She was hitting decibels dangerous to psychics and dogs.
[50:19.90]Seemed like a good time to find my lovely escort.
[50:29.78]What the hell is going on?
[50:31.44]Dead body, lots of blood.
[50:33.08]Your sister thinks I did it.
[50:34.20]Decibels does not equal frequency.
[50:36.90]Come on, let's go.
[50:39.30]Yeah, so?
[50:39.96]Alright, here we go.
[50:41.48]We're on the right track.
[50:44.88]This time I'm gonna stay as Bagman.
[50:46.92]I'm not gonna change from Bagman this time.
[50:52.42]I wanna be Bagman for the rest of the playthrough.
[50:58.44]Oh shit, I think I misplaced the second disk.
[51:00.62]No, shit, that's Jurassic Park.
[51:02.05]It looks the exact same.
[51:02.91]Where'd it go?
[51:04.87]Oh no.
[51:06.91]Disk 3?
[51:08.21]That's Disk 1.
[51:09.27]Where's Disk 2?
[51:15.17]This is why I fucking hated having multiple discs.
[51:20.26]You could always get to the same part of Final Fantasy VII before you had to stop.
[51:24.44]Right before you met Katsith.
[51:36.48]Here we go.
[51:48.44]Spoilers.
[51:48.88]It's a character in the game.
[51:49.78]What are you talking about?
[51:52.62]Alright, these are both right here.
[51:53.66]I got them right in front of me.
[51:58.79]It's Kate, not Kat.
[51:59.81]It was the perfect time to a lousy party.
[52:06.19]I sat there knowing two things dead certain.
[52:08.85]Layna was going to drag me in deeper, and I was going to follow.
[52:12.45]Like some oversexed schnauzer.
[52:16.22]Should I not touch the bracelet this time?
[52:19.26]What's that mean?
[52:20.82]It means, stop it.
[52:22.99]Alright, this may sound whacked.
[52:24.89]Your dad really did jump out the window.
[52:26.71]It sounded whacked.
[52:27.45]But not exactly suicide.
[52:29.77]What was it?
[52:31.11]I don't know.
[52:32.11]Someone was messing with his head.
[52:33.25]That's not possible.
[52:37.04]What's not?
[52:38.68]Um, well, you know... This is some ugly-ass seat covers.
[52:42.72]I'm still trying to get used to it.
[52:44.96]Yeah, right.
[52:46.30]You sure look busted up about it.
[52:50.26]So, are we good night?
[52:50.94]Alright.
[52:53.10]Watch Monica.
[52:54.37]Just a little more.
[52:55.15]I'm gonna let her go.
[52:55.95]I do not trust this Mirage quest.
[52:57.97]I'm gonna let her go.
[52:58.93]You're going?
[52:59.49]I have to.
[53:01.97]Don't ask why.
[53:02.75]I just hate... I don't like the rules.
[53:07.15]What?
[53:08.31]Eric.
[53:09.05]Maybe I wanna know why.
[53:10.87]People are in danger.
[53:12.35]Let's be specific.
[53:14.17]Lexi, Anna, all my cousins, little children.
[53:17.77]Just trust me.
[53:18.53]I have to follow Monica.
[53:20.59]Come by later, bring the boyfriend, bring the whole box of dirty secrets.
[53:24.06]If there's a knife in my back, throw it in the sink.
[53:26.40]I'll do it in the morning.
[53:27.16]What?
[53:27.28]What do you mean if there's a knife in my back?
[53:35.42]I got something in my eye.
[53:36.22]Do I follow her?
[53:38.28]We're gonna try to get different outcomes this time.
[53:40.58]Alright, we're gonna... We're gonna just go inside of her head.
[53:44.81]Something's in my eye.
[53:47.65]It's horrible.
[53:48.28]It's like a knife in my eye.
[53:49.56]Ugh.
[54:01.00]Go to hell.
[54:02.00]What?
[54:02.34]Hey, bright boy.
[54:03.78]Wanna get arrested?
[54:04.88]Go sit in the cop car.
[54:06.36]How are ya?
[54:07.54]Mokey Valdez.
[54:10.56]You're that psychic kid.
[54:11.66]Flash-o.
[54:12.40]Flash in the pan.
[54:13.66]I seen the act.
[54:14.66]I wanna get arrested.
[54:15.41]Okay.
[54:16.29]To my pal, Mokey.
[54:18.79]Listen, you little butts.
[54:20.01]You're flying blind.
[54:21.27]You need Mokey.
[54:22.53]Mokey knows the dirt.
[54:24.27]I think we need Mokey.
[54:25.65]Stored in my cheeks.
[54:27.35]That would explain the breath.
[54:29.32]Listen, you do me a little job, I clue you in.
[54:33.00]Oh, shit.
[54:33.44]Okay, say, Foxy, time's a- No, no, no, we're gonna go with Moki.
[54:37.94]This may have been a mistake.
[54:40.16]I end up with you.
[54:41.12]Hey, kid, you haven't seen me dance.
[54:48.27]You know how they pronounce it?
[54:51.07]Frick.
[54:53.33]What assholes.
[54:54.55]So?
[54:55.01]So, history lesson.
[54:57.70]Who is this guy?
[55:13.27]So where do you fit in?
[55:14.83]I ran a little office.
[55:16.43]Code name, Svengali.
[55:18.81]You're a spook?
[55:19.55]I'm a broker.
[55:21.57]Lexi wants a defect.
[55:23.03]I bring the dough.
[55:24.05]He brings me one of these.
[55:26.57]Then what happened?
[55:27.70]He grabbed two and flew.
[55:29.46]Too bad his chopper didn't.
[55:31.96]These photos are huge.
[55:33.10]I'm standing in Finland, my jutsu in my hands.
[55:35.72]And a Svengali.
[55:37.20]So that leaves two collectors.
[55:39.40]He's not only psychic, he can count.
[55:44.52]Alright, let's get to work.
[55:45.66]Here's the key.
[55:46.90]You piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.
[55:50.71]Main room, far left corner.
[55:52.25]Yeah.
[55:53.37]It's not like I use a map.
[55:55.78]Exactly what it means.
[55:57.32]Sexy.
[55:57.52]Okay.
[55:57.72]Is there opportunity?
[55:58.50]Fake it.
[55:58.74]The phone call.
[55:59.32]Did I- I didn't fake it?
[56:25.58]Are you still sitting here?
[56:29.19]Oh, I'm faking being inside.
[56:30.55]Kill him.
[56:30.89]Kill him.
[56:56.26]I'll be talking to you again.
[56:59.23]Fox.
[57:01.23]Fox!
[57:02.11]Get back here.
[57:03.91]Yeah, I'm with you.
[57:05.45]How'd it play?
[57:06.33]Let's hear it.
[57:07.39]You put the fear of God in him.
[57:08.75]Oh, for real?
[57:09.93]White as a ghost, Moke.
[57:11.33]Anyone hear him talking roosties?
[57:12.81]Just the whole damn room.
[57:14.71]You're a lying little punk.
[57:16.84]Maybe I couldn't get there in time.
[57:18.60]Maybe you're full of crap.
[57:21.15]Why don't you go peep the psychic slut?
[57:23.95]That's about your speed.
[57:25.83]What?
[57:30.50]And if you're thinking of taking a ride in my head... That wouldn't hurt that much.
[57:38.82]That would not even really hurt.
[57:39.85]That'd be slightly irritating.
[57:43.87]Wait, we just got tell-taled.
[57:45.03]No!
[57:48.27]Psychic pizza.
[57:49.45]We know when you're hungry.
[57:56.64]Okay, let's get this part right.
[58:00.30]This guy ends up with like three stab wounds in his chest.
[58:02.72]We have to stop it.
[58:08.89]Kiki dance?
[58:10.05]Kiki dance?
[58:11.03]Kiki's the- Kiki's the toy.
[58:14.07]Well, who do you think?
[58:15.03]This guy gets shmurdered.
[58:16.09]The great Vladimir.
[58:17.53]How could he?
[58:19.11]We have to follow him around.
[58:20.13]He's so pleased with himself.
[58:21.33]What's his name?
[58:21.95]Such an elegant solution to such a messy situation.
[58:26.27]the two of you he didn't approve oh please I just don't want to explain hey yeah that's the the four device he laughs at the rodents
[59:04.86]He died.
[59:05.34]Kiki is the doll.
[59:15.52]Can we help him?
[59:18.92]Okay, here we go.
[59:21.09]This is where it all goes to hell.
[59:22.19]This is how I fucked it up last time.
[59:25.07]We gotta jump to somebody else here.
[59:27.41]We need all four.
[59:30.69]And you think I can find the other three?
[59:34.81]just hope you're ready help him I'm gonna try because last time didn't I go to the old lady and then we came back here and there's a bunch of dead people
[60:06.89]okay alright he's my friend max there's a little hot shit no no no no no go back back back back back back that name means nothing to me no shit
[60:32.25]We left for two seconds.
[60:34.82]We left for two seconds, man.
[60:37.10]I just like, in the time it took me to wash my hands in the bathroom.
[60:47.39]What the fuck?
[60:48.95]Why did he die?
[60:49.79]Can I go back?
[60:50.41]Can I go back?
[61:00.94]I went to the same guy.
[61:08.91]Redo?
[61:09.63]I think I'm okay.
[61:10.51]I think I'm okay.
[61:11.13]I think I'm okay.
[61:11.73]Somebody said cigarettes are cool.
[61:12.90]We gotta have a cigarette.
[61:38.70]Everybody smokes inside.
[61:39.80]Everybody has yellow curtains and yellow stained ceilings.
[61:47.35]No wonder a realtor is going to come in and say the property value dropped by like 40 grand because the whole house is yellow.
[61:55.53]No, no, no.
[61:57.75]I smoke in the house.
[62:06.86]I think I can still salvage it, though.
[62:08.05]I really think I can.
[62:18.93]I can't believe the exact... The dude fucking died again, and that guy came in with a gun.
[62:23.54]He didn't even shoot anybody, though.
[62:24.88]Alright, let's... I'm gonna get this right.
[62:35.14]Here we go.
[62:35.42]Ready?
[62:38.34]And go.
[62:40.91]Shit, no.
[62:41.63]Back.
[62:56.64]I was sick to death of trespassing, head-hopping, trans- Old suck.
[63:00.74]My toes are itching like a bat.
[63:07.79]Why did I click that?
[63:09.67]Why did I click that?
[63:11.90]Why did I click that?
[63:13.40]I tried to piece the night back together.
[63:15.72]That psychic slushy cup collector had torqued me sideways.
[63:20.16]And something was trying to bubble up.
[63:24.56]I... I had done this before.
[63:26.87]No, alright, let's go somewhere else.
[63:28.91]Can I psychic somewhere else?
[63:32.03]Somehow, my father knew.
[63:37.42]I never trespassed again.
[63:39.62]Until last night.
[63:41.42]And like a sick joke, they threw me in the closet.
[63:48.10]I think we still get out.
[63:51.70]There was squat to do.
[63:53.24]Hard to keep the mind sharp.
[63:55.28]I thought about all the women I'd ever slept with.
[63:57.36]What?
[63:58.00]All the women I wish I'd slept with.
[64:00.37]All the women who called me shallow.
[64:02.17]All the women who never called me back.
[64:05.17]And then...
[64:07.28]And then I thought about like, you know, what the plan was going to be.
[64:13.21]What the fuck is going on?
[64:24.62]Oh, we had a new follower just came in.
[64:25.92]A new viewer.
[64:29.26]It'll tickle the top of your lip.
[64:32.34]Yes, Wawashka.
[64:33.62]The exotic sparkling water of the free world.
[64:37.22]Look for it in the unforgettable green bottle.
[64:42.25]Turn it down!
[64:42.75]Bubbles you can lick.
[64:44.43]Bubbles you can sip.
[64:45.15]Bubbles that'll tickle the top of your lip.
[64:47.79]Come on.
[64:49.49]Somebody likes you, kid.
[64:50.47]Come on, hot shot.
[64:51.83]Up.
[64:53.85]Welcome him.
[64:55.02]Welcome him.
[64:55.46]Is there some way to go?
[64:56.86]Front door sounds good.
[64:58.84]Okay, this is it.
[65:01.02]Opportunity here.
[65:07.22]Wait, it's different.
[65:07.70]Bokey!
[65:23.14]I got a real job for you.
[65:24.54]A real gimme.
[65:25.10]A thousand bucks in 30 minutes.
[65:26.99]Doing what?
[65:27.97]Sort of psychic seal of approval.
[65:30.02]Make sure my collector...
[65:31.62]Ain't a fake.
[65:33.24]Come on, kid.
[65:34.36]Clock's a-tickin'.
[65:35.42]You think?
[65:35.78]Yeah, we're gonna go.
[65:36.86]Kid, this is white hot.
[65:38.70]We snag a collector.
[65:40.58]We're big league.
[65:41.74]Psychic mercenaries.
[65:42.72]Eyes on the road, please.
[65:44.24]That collector belongs to Lena.
[65:45.81]The hell it does.
[65:46.75]I shelled out cash four years ago.
[65:48.53]So you say.
[65:49.97]Don't you get it?
[65:51.49]Lexi never died.
[65:53.99]A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.
[65:57.46]A ponytail?
[65:57.96]Okay, here we are.
[65:58.96]And... He's very small.
[66:00.48]Every- I didn't know he was that small.
[66:19.17]I'm taller than that.
[66:19.81]I'm way taller than that.
[66:20.77]Okay.
[66:49.75]Oh, yeah.
[66:53.11]You can go weirder.
[66:54.07]What?
[66:56.05]Much weirder.
[66:58.94]I'll pick the lint out of your back pocket and stuff it into a chicken breast and eat it.
[67:06.59]Just ask me.
[67:09.89]Just give me the collector.
[67:14.23]Somebody call the fire department!
[67:19.91]Hey!
[67:20.15]What?
[67:20.65]Whose limo is this?
[67:22.09]Run!
[67:43.71]Yeah, I was a coward.
[67:45.43]And he was toast.
[67:46.97]Lightly buttered and burnt to a crisp.
[67:49.29]Max Mirage knew all the Black Diamond tricks, but he was never going to share them.
[67:54.91]What is this?
[67:55.51]They just went up on the curb.
[68:04.51]I've been looking for you for hours.
[68:06.11]Sorry, I was trying to help Moki.
[68:08.67]What happened?
[68:09.19]Fried rice.
[68:12.06]Max has three collectors.
[68:13.68]He's Alexi in disguise.
[68:15.50]What's new with you?
[68:17.48]Monica.
[68:17.92]How do we get out of this mess?
[68:21.80]By making Q stronger.
[68:23.24]I gotta get stronger.
[68:25.26]Okay, yeah, here we go.
[68:26.46]Back to the mansion.
[68:27.94]She has to see it alone.
[68:29.60]And I'll wait in here.
[68:34.09]Wait!
[68:34.85]Look!
[68:35.57]Come here.
[68:36.57]It's here.
[68:37.13]The fourth collector.
[68:40.26]Oh, please, Eric.
[68:41.64]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
[68:43.65]I missed them all!
[68:44.53]I missed them all.
[68:45.01]I didn't know what to do.
[68:48.33]I was gonna go to Madame T. Jeremy, you stink.
[69:01.06]Hey, it's okay.
[69:06.92]I'm not gonna get the same ending.
[69:17.18]So he had the case hidden away.
[69:22.04]It's gonna be the same ending.
[69:24.42]It's not gonna be the same ending.
[69:30.17]So he's strong because he has more of those collectors.
[69:39.29]I need all four to beat him in the mind game.
[69:44.19]Alright, let's go to Madam T. While it's still time.
[69:46.47]Wait, did they say Lexi is Max with, like, with, like, plastic surgery, he said?
[69:50.37]He's like, oh, he got his face changed and stuff.
[70:16.30]And then did he say that?
[70:17.88]I'm confused by that.
[70:24.43]Oh, right.
[70:26.11]Smothering the old lady.
[70:27.25]What'd I do?
[70:37.38]What did I do?
[70:38.48]Saved her.
[71:05.46]See?
[71:05.68]I think we just-
[71:17.85]Get the collector.
[71:19.59]Go to Max.
[71:21.49]Challenge him the game.
[71:23.13]Why not get the collector?
[71:26.08]Hide from Max.
[71:26.76]Play with the collector.
[71:28.02]He is too powerful.
[71:30.52]If you do not stop him, he will hunt you like a dog.
[71:34.56]I never got to practice.
[71:35.94]Own the fear.
[71:38.20]Find the scar.
[71:40.34]Choose me if you can.
[71:42.34]I'll choose her.
[71:42.92]It doesn't make sense.
[71:45.42]Not all the games make sense.
[71:47.47]Not all the games that makes sense.
[71:48.83]It's a Christopher Walken character.
[71:49.79]She's in the car?
[71:50.83]No, I don't want to confront him though.
[71:52.37]Choose her and the shoe.
[72:14.56]Should I?
[72:14.88]Should we go in there, though, or should we do something else?
[72:17.50]Because, look, it's like, oh, go get him.
[72:19.91]We don't have to, though, do we?
[72:23.87]Oh, fuck you, game.
[72:24.95]Okay, so what's the play here?
[72:29.59]It's Madam T. Shoe.
[72:33.55]Cigarette.
[72:41.46]Cigarette.
[72:44.19]I guess I could, couldn't I?
[72:49.05]Does it really matter?
[72:57.54]Let's see.
[72:58.44]Does anybody have a walkthrough for this game?
[73:14.86]Okay, I remember this part.
[73:17.18]Okay, let me see.
[73:26.92]So, tricks to play Black Diamond.
[73:39.47]Anna, the kite, Monica, or Lena are powerful.
[73:45.31]Monica's weakness is with the doll and Moki.
[73:52.98]And Lena is a draw with the doll and Sergi.
[73:56.60]I think I would ever figure this out on my own.
[74:03.47]No way I would ever figure this out.
[74:11.79]I filled it with hate.
[74:14.33]I left her alone and scared.
[74:18.43]I left her for him.
[74:26.16]Queen Bee is all hot and bothered.
[74:28.36]I gotta rub that itch.
[74:32.34]If you must.
[74:33.54]Just let me hang on to this.
[74:35.04]I'm trying a different tactic.
[74:38.60]Wait in there.
[74:40.94]I don't want to... I got no time for catfights.
[74:43.18]Am I telling her to wait while I go spend time with this girl?
[74:48.00]Wait.
[74:49.14]What?
[74:51.56]You're in the wrong room.
[74:53.66]You know I'm rooting for you way deep down.
[75:11.19]Can you help me beat Max?
[75:13.98]Oh, right.
[75:15.46]Like any of you care about me.
[75:17.66]You want a creamsicle, Moki?
[75:22.86]OK.
[75:27.83]Which one of these is your favorite?
[75:31.35]Soldier.
[75:32.13]Good.
[75:32.53]I tell you what, you can have it.
[75:36.57]But I need to know what happened to you.
[75:39.04]Scary.
[75:46.40]What happened to him?
[75:47.14]Why is he like three?
[75:48.44]Do you remember where you were?
[75:52.52]Do you know where Eric Fox is?
[76:02.81]They all come here for me to adore their Max.
[76:10.21]There's nobody in this audience.
[76:12.15]Play a little hide and seek.
[76:14.17]He's a megalomaniac.
[76:15.23]What?
[76:16.03]What just happened?
[76:19.49]Wait, we were just then?
[76:23.59]Who's that dude?
[76:38.72]Ezek turtle, Lexi.
[76:41.86]Go on, get her out of here.
[76:43.22]I want my sister!
[76:43.98]I still want Eric!
[76:46.21]But I'm so very fond of the Pozok family.
[76:48.63]We were too busy watching the little kid play with toys.
[76:54.51]Can we sort of skip the male bonding?
[76:58.68]As you wish.
[77:01.92]The old man only cared about results.
[77:04.16]Total neuralytic paralysis.
[77:06.77]But how do you destroy someone mentally?
[77:09.77]You take their fears and traumas and nightmares and turn them up.
[77:15.68]Full volume.
[77:16.56]A hideous marching band at the back of the brain.
[77:20.52]All very amusing with rabbits and mice and half-dead soldiers.
[77:27.18]But when two people know what's happening, two talented people, it's really a most fascinating game.
[77:34.29]You have your thoughts?
[77:37.23]Three.
[77:42.67]Four.
[77:44.43]He activated the four pillars.
[77:46.75]Here we go.
[77:47.95]Okay.
[77:49.05]So.
[77:53.06]Who is it?
[77:53.76]Who is Anna?
[77:58.12]The cat.
[77:58.60]He's afraid of the cat.
[77:59.28]He's afraid of the cat.
[77:59.84]He's afraid of the cat.
[78:00.36]He's afraid of the cat.
[78:00.84]He's afraid of the cat.
[78:01.48]He's gonna fear cats.
[78:03.68]Madam.
[78:04.50]Definitely madam.
[78:07.12]We need Madam in there.
[78:08.16]She said use her.
[78:09.78]I think he's afraid of cats.
[78:15.36]Cigarette?
[78:17.54]I think I'm going to use the cat.
[78:20.48]Okay, now what else?
[78:27.60]Which one of these is Monica and which one of these is Lena?
[78:30.70]Shoe?
[78:31.20]There is no shoe.
[78:34.42]Cigarette?
[78:36.26]Cigarette?
[78:38.04]Or skull?
[78:39.22]Cigarette.
[78:40.86]Alright, we got one more choice here.
[78:44.12]Left or right?
[78:50.04]I don't know which one of these is who.
[78:52.60]Skull?
[78:55.74]Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.
[78:59.62]Okay, let's do it.
[79:06.25]My move.
[79:08.27]Okay, so cigarette versus... Cat versus cigarette.
[79:12.44]No, cat smoke cigarette versus doll.
[79:18.98]Cigarette versus... Uh... Shoe.
[79:23.52]There's no shoe.
[79:28.14]Don't let the cat smoke.
[79:29.49]I'm not.
[79:31.71]Old woman to red square.
[79:35.08]Okay, old woman to red square?
[79:41.37]Yes?
[79:45.07]Got it.
[79:45.35]Be careful, boy.
[79:46.37]She'll suck you dry.
[79:47.91]She needs you to keep herself strong.
[79:50.31]The only thing she needs is your ass on a platter.
[79:55.08]Good.
[79:55.58]Alright, good move.
[79:59.20]No!
[80:00.16]It's my game now.
[80:02.36]The old man can rot.
[80:04.85]I make the rules.
[80:06.60]It means whatever I want it to mean.
[80:09.18]Cat dead.
[80:09.60]Uh-oh.
[80:12.80]Okay, now we need... Uh, cigarette ver- uh... I don't know.
[80:21.95]Old lady versus doll?
[80:23.77]Or girl versus doll?
[80:25.69]Cigarette versus skull?
[80:31.52]Cigarette versus skull.
[80:34.39]Yes, I would be paralyzed as well.
[80:39.83]I just wrote WHO CARES in all caps.
[80:43.97]Cigarette on Lady?
[80:46.83]On Cigarette on Lady?
[80:49.25]Oh, they canceled each other out!
[80:50.73]Shit!
[80:51.19]A lot of real estate for a lucky man.
[80:53.53]Okay, come on!
[80:55.79]Come on!
[80:57.97]OH!
[81:00.45]Alright, we got Old Lady versus Doll.
[81:03.95]This is all we can do!
[81:04.65]This is it!
[81:05.85]Come on!
[81:07.51]YES!
[81:12.29]I win!
[81:12.65]The kite!
[81:24.98]I'm alright!
[81:26.54]I did it!
[81:27.97]Why is he three feet tall?
[81:28.89]Oh.
[81:28.97]Oh.
[81:29.05]Never mind.
[81:29.35]Oh.
[81:29.47]Pretty prize luck.
[81:51.72]okay conclusions oh oh I got I know I know what this is I get it now I get it these are all the endings that makes sense sure okay so we had double war last time oh no what did we have last time the big kiss the grand slam no third chances
[82:20.61]Double War, Maximum Eric.
[82:27.27]Maximum Eric.
[82:29.70]What's the big kiss?
[82:31.42]I have no idea.
[82:35.08]No shit, dude.
[82:38.20]Is it that obvious?
[82:40.00]We want Maximum Eric.
[82:41.46]I don't know how to do that.
[82:47.19]Uh, so this- the only walkthrough that I could really- this- one of the walkthroughs that I found, uh, gave like a bunch of just like random info, and then at the end says, for different endings, you can try to play this game again.
[82:57.66]Sorry if you find difficulty with this walkthrough.
[83:00.70]And then that's it.
[83:03.08]Who the fuck was gonna make a walkthrough for this game?
[83:05.02]I can't- I don't know, I'm not gonna be able to get Maximum Eric.
[83:09.56]Hold on, alright.
[83:10.54]Maximum Eric Ending.
[83:14.87]Psychic Detective.
[83:21.47]Like a detective strategy guy.
[83:22.85]I don't know.
[83:26.17]Maximum Eric time.
[83:27.77]YouTube it.
[83:28.39]Nobody has this on YouTube.
[83:32.61]Cheat code central.
[83:36.80]Due to the interactive nature of this title, there are many ways to complete the game.
[83:39.84]The game can finish in one of several endings.
[83:43.06]Although the following walkthrough may not be the most optimal, it does expose most of the major plot themes.
[83:49.21]Note the solution branches at several points in order to reach different endings.
[83:52.79]Okay.
[83:56.77]Hold on a minute.
[83:59.45]So the Grand Slam solution is the best ending.
[84:04.83]I think these are ranked in how good of an ending they are.
[84:09.18]Uh, if you want to know, Moki's Playmate is you play the entire game without making a single choice.
[84:17.73]You just let it do whatever it's going to do.
[84:19.23]That's how you get that ending.
[84:23.55]So, I mean, I don't, we want to go back and just watch the whole thing to see what happens.
[84:37.21]Okay.
[84:38.11]Alright, let's see.
[84:38.87]Let's at least get the worst ending in the whole game, okay?
[84:47.34]I'm seeing a lot more yeses than I see nos.
[84:52.94]Look, you can't just write fuck off.
[84:56.54]Do them all.
[84:57.44]I'm not going to do them all.
[85:03.01]Alright.
[85:04.21]What's the village idiot?
[85:05.43]Hold on.
[85:10.63]Maximum Eric Solution.
[85:15.55]Hold on.
[85:20.43]Yeah, that's real specific shit in a lot of these later endings.
[85:27.75]No.
[85:28.29]Alright, we're gonna do the dog shit ending.
[85:34.33]Who owns the secret room?
[85:35.48]I don't know.
[85:45.41]I'm just gonna sit here back here and drink some coffee and hang out.
[85:48.85]Make us click the ending we want.
[85:50.53]Guys, I can't even get the solutions to these endings.
[85:52.69]There's so many of them and none of them have any guides.
[85:55.45]And the game is such a mess that I can't do them all.
[86:00.35]Okay, here we go.
[86:01.59]I am going to put the controller down.
[86:02.85]I'm not going to touch anything.
[86:03.67]Let's see what happens.
[86:09.30]Here we go.
[86:17.97]That's my sister, Monica.
[86:20.27]Cute.
[86:21.59]Very cute.
[86:22.63]Very weak and gullible.
[86:24.61]Who's the plastic dress?

[86:47.35]So I just don't port over.
[86:49.23]I don't warg into anybody.

[89:19.03]There's a lot of shit here that we did not look at.
[89:21.41]We just looked out the window and then ran down the stairs.
[89:45.14]Wait, doesn't Moki show all these photos here?
[89:47.78]Yeah, remember Moki shows all these pictures?
[89:49.40]He stole them from here.

[90:44.99]I must ask you to go.
[90:47.22]Your uncle was a big noise.
[90:49.00]A real player in the old country.
[90:51.74]Paranormal espionage.
[90:53.44]That's all I'm allowed to say.
[90:55.20]But perhaps you would be interested in a little collectible?
[90:59.76]Shadster.
[91:01.20]He's shameless.
[91:05.86]Maybe I was trying too hard.
[91:08.00]Maybe I stubbed my brain on something.
[91:10.39]Because I was hearing voices.
[91:12.33]Big time.
[91:14.44]That's right.
[91:16.30]Come this way.
[91:18.92]All the way.
[91:21.40]Time to pay me a visit.
[91:23.62]Weren't we in somebody else's head at this point?
[91:26.49]Just walked around in a circle.
[91:32.15]I am Tikunov.
[91:34.67]Madame Tikunov.
[91:44.50]because this was the tutorial that we missed quite the spread I don't clean up after this lady she's got like five empty coffee containers oh well that's interesting never mind I didn't say that yeah you smell anything in here you've got your own gift
[92:13.46]I made a mental note.
[92:15.20]Be less amusing.
[92:17.02]Come and sit.
[92:19.34]But not to touch the game.
[92:21.64]It is bad.
[92:23.37]The devil itself.
[92:29.67]What happened?
[92:30.25]I didn't touch anything.
[92:31.09]Bravo.
[92:33.31]Just trying to hit on me here?
[93:00.73]You know, only some of us can, you know, do the sex in our heads.
[93:05.65]I'm one of them if I'm available.
[93:09.78]There's only three people on Earth that can do this.
[93:12.18]How can you?
[93:14.02]You think it is a big joke, playing with the power.
[93:17.92]Oh, come on.
[93:18.66]It's a living mental sleight of hand.
[93:20.96]It is more.
[93:23.42]Yes, you are scared.
[93:25.90]But you are the only one who can stop him.
[93:28.80]Stop who?
[93:32.66]Where is Chad?
[93:33.94]In the study.
[93:35.14]Quickly!
[93:35.98]Go to him!
[93:42.34]Oh no!
[93:43.04]Chad's dead!
[93:44.18]What happens if you don't touch anything though?
[93:47.20]If you don't say anything or do anything?
[93:48.28]Do you just leave?
[93:50.98]I'm assuming if you pick up the knife, everyone goes, he did it!
[93:53.66]And you get arrested and you go to disk three automatically, right?
[94:02.39]Time to go.
[94:02.73]Okay.
[94:02.87]Incoming disk two.
[94:03.63]This is great.
[94:34.07]I'm gonna hold on to this one.
[94:35.51]I'm gonna keep this in a glass case.
[94:39.85]I'm gonna hand down Psychic Detective to my grandchildren.
[94:43.95]Oh shit, was that just two or just three?
[94:46.82]No, we're good.
[94:54.38]Green Vented.
[94:57.00]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[94:58.64]I see what you're doing.
[95:00.24]I kind of get it.
[95:01.54]Although I don't.
[95:02.86]You know, I watch people stream Among Us, and I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[95:06.16]I just kind of pretend like I do.
[95:07.96]And then they just all start yelling at each other.
[95:10.15]I sat there knowing two things dead certain.
[95:12.57]Lainan was going to drag me in deeper, and I was going to follow.
[95:16.19]Like some over-sex schnauzer.
[95:21.51]Abdahoka.
[95:23.01]What's that mean?
[95:24.57]It means, stop it.
[95:26.65]alright this may sound whacked your dad really did jump out the window but not exactly suicide he's still playing this well actually I don't know you're wrong someone was messing with his head I'm not playing this at all actually I'm sitting here without the controller in my hand what's not um well you know that he's dead I'm still trying to get used to it yeah right you sure look busted up about it
[95:53.94]This ending is gonna suck, too.
[95:55.34]It's not even gonna be worth doing this a third time.
[95:56.98]Watch, Monica.
[95:58.09]Just a little more.
[95:59.67]I do not trust this Mirage quest.
[96:02.65]You're going?
[96:04.43]I have to.
[96:05.71]Don't ask why.
[96:07.55]Just hate me if you must.
[96:12.85]What's that face I can do?
[96:13.79]I can do, like, a sad face.
[96:14.89]I can do a sad reaction.
[96:16.69]I missed that.
[96:17.21]Oh, I would've done a sad reaction.
[96:19.67]Go home, idiot.
[96:20.83]How come I never thought about going home?
[96:27.81]Wait, do I go home?
[96:34.51]Hey, bright boy.
[96:35.91]Wanna get arrested?
[96:36.63]Go sit in the cop car.
[96:38.50]How are ya?
[96:39.68]Mokey Valdez.
[96:40.92]You're that psychic kid.
[96:43.82]Flash-o.
[96:44.56]Flash in the pan.
[96:45.82]I seen the act.
[96:47.28]Mokey's plaything.
[96:48.46]To my pal, Mokey.
[96:50.92]Listen, you little butts.
[96:52.14]You're flying blind.
[96:53.40]You need Mokey.
[96:54.66]Mokey knows the dirt.
[96:56.74]I collect it.
[96:57.78]Store it in my cheeks.
[96:59.49]That would explain the breath.
[97:01.47]Listen, you do me a little job.
[97:03.37]I...
[97:04.37]We also could have followed Monica, too.
[97:05.89]That could have been interesting.
[97:07.43]Two exotic bombshells.
[97:10.73]I end up with you.
[97:12.79]Hey, kid.
[97:13.35]You haven't seen me dance.
[97:28.76]You know how they pronounce it?
[97:29.98]Frick.
[97:33.82]What assholes.
[97:35.04]So?
[97:35.50]So, history lesson.
[97:38.20]The Black Diamond Campfire Girls circa 1987.
[97:41.84]This is the Resident Evil 7 family.
[97:45.22]Vladimir Potsock.
[97:47.29]The KGB kissed his ass like it was sable.
[97:49.89]Know why?
[97:51.31]He made a little toy.
[97:53.21]The Psychic Collector.
[97:55.21]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[97:59.02]Little Lena, we know.
[98:01.73]Damn good psychic, but a skitzy broad with a psychopathic papa.
[98:05.43]Boo hoo.
[98:06.79]Anna Slaznewitz, eight years old.
[98:08.97]She boils a cup of tea by looking at him.
[98:18.34]Turn myself into Moki.
[98:19.96]Morty, I'm Moki.
[98:21.54]I'm Moki, Morty.
[98:25.27]It's not even funny.
[98:27.73]I'm laughing at it, though.
[98:28.81]I don't know why, because this makes no fucking sense, what you just said.
[98:31.89]Paranoid.
[98:38.39]Look Morty, I turned myself into Mokey Morty.
[98:41.79]Here's the key.
[98:43.05]You piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.
[98:46.85]Main room, far left corner.
[98:48.49]Maybe we go in.
[98:49.49]It's not like I use a map.
[98:51.81]Hey, I wouldn't know.
[98:53.47]I'm not psychic.
[98:54.35]I don't have the sexy gift.
[98:55.99]I just come from a clean, straight shot home where nobody messed me up.
[99:00.04]What's that supposed to mean?
[99:01.82]It means I know things.
[99:04.72]As usual.
[99:07.10]Moki Andy.
[99:09.02]That's fine.
[99:10.62]This, yeah, sure.
[99:11.04]There's a phone call coming in two minutes.
[99:14.27]Be there for it, and don't screw me.
[99:21.61]Fox?
[99:23.09]No, I don't even go in.
[99:23.91]Lucky psychic bastard, where are you?
[99:27.81]Inside?
[99:28.25]Halfway across the room?
[99:33.33]Here we go, kid.
[99:37.02]It's the same path.
[99:38.28]Yeah, it is the same path.
[99:39.38]It's the same run.
[99:46.38]Are you telling me that me actively playing the game versus the game playing itself is the... I did it just as bad?
[99:58.78]That seems fucking impossible.
[100:00.14]Yeah, I'm with you.
[100:01.58]How'd it play?
[100:02.46]Let's hear it.
[100:03.55]You put the fear of God in it.
[100:04.91]Oh, for real?
[100:06.07]White as a ghost, Moke.
[100:07.47]Anyone hear him talking roosty?
[100:08.95]Just the whole damn room.
[100:10.85]You're a lying little punk.
[100:12.97]Maybe I couldn't get there in time.
[100:14.73]Maybe you're full of crap.
[100:17.29]Why don't you go peep the psychic slut?
[100:20.05]Why would this be Mokey's playthrough?
[100:21.75]Or Mokey's plaything?
[100:23.46]If we don't do what he wants and he gets angry and runs away.
[100:26.64]And if you're thinking of taking a ride in my head...
[100:38.25]Eight, four, eight.
[100:39.75]There it is.
[100:41.33]Okay, this part, I'm really- I need to see what really happens here.
[100:44.81]This dude is the guy that walks in with his hands on his chest, blood everywhere, and the guy with the gun.
[100:52.08]We keep missing this part.
[100:54.02]Not this time.
[100:55.34]Why couldn't you watch Monica?
[100:59.10]Why couldn't you trust me a little longer?
[101:01.18]I mean, you ruined everything, Eric.
[101:04.74]Everything!
[101:06.83]Say something!
[101:07.89]Was there a hand over there?
[101:09.91]I quit.
[101:10.81]I quit a puncher?
[101:11.73]What the fuck was that?
[101:13.25]On principle, of course.
[101:14.88]Not because you're running away.
[101:16.82]Oh, you think I'm scared?
[101:18.98]I can feel it.
[101:20.96]Even when you touch.
[101:23.96]Just before the flash, it's there.
[101:27.28]What happens if I don't come back?
[101:30.95]What happens if I come back like this?
[101:36.53]don't touch anything don't touch anything my father made this not to teach or to feel better but to destroy my sergey from inside out and you want me to use it you will come back you are the best I've seen
[102:06.05]okay so now no no no no I didn't do anything why is it I didn't do anything it's not gonna come back with him walking in with blood all over him is it it's gonna open no it's not it's not
[102:34.09]Okay, don't do anything I want to see what's happening to him
[102:57.04]Not a child.
[102:58.58]Not your child.
[103:00.00]Our house.
[103:01.32]Max and Monica.
[103:02.94]You must drink to the death.
[103:04.78]Get out!
[103:06.50]She don't know what you say.
[103:10.43]This is Dracula.
[103:10.97]Dracula.
[103:11.19]She's gonna get glassed.
[103:44.11]Okay, we're good.
[103:45.25]Now let's see what happens here.
[103:52.92]It can't be changed.
[103:55.02]You can't change it.
[103:58.12]Maybe you could have.
[103:59.10]Maybe you could have gone back and seen what they were doing, but...
[104:05.91]You have the right to remain silent.
[104:07.39]You have the right to an attorney.
[104:08.53]Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[104:13.47]Fine.
[104:13.92]Lock me in my cell.
[104:15.58]It sure as hell couldn't keep me in my body.
[104:18.62]You could have switched to that guy's POV.
[104:27.79]It's not going to be the same ending.
[104:28.69]It's going to be impossible to be the same ending.
[104:31.05]I didn't even notice that face the guy on the left was making.
[105:06.90]Alright, here we go.
[105:07.50]It's time for the conclusion.
[105:09.76]Not pressing a single button.
[105:17.37]If we get the same ending, I'm going to be very, very mad.
[105:22.52]That would be upsetting to me.
[105:35.35]Alright, I got the worst ending on my own.
[105:37.84]I don't think that was the worst ending.
[105:39.12]I think it was a bad one, but not the worst one.
[105:50.08]Go to Bagman.
[105:52.34]I'll be honest, I don't even know how I got to Bagman...
[106:05.97]In the first place.
[106:06.51]What is this dork cube, Link?
[106:12.29]What the hell is dork cube?
[106:13.81]It's reused Link.
[106:15.47]I'm not doing the feet thing right there.
[106:18.85]No.
[106:19.59]No.
[106:37.75]You won the Black Diamonds game last time.
[106:39.95]That's the only thing that made it a good ending.
[106:42.69]You got the worst good ending.
[106:44.83]Dork you are.
[106:45.63]Hold on.
[106:46.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[107:03.11]Great.
[107:03.43]Great.
[107:03.81]Very cool link.
[107:04.51]Crashing the website.
[107:05.75]Well, when like 6,000 people click on something at the same time, I'm going to assume it's not going to go very well.
[107:35.72]It's so weird because when you- When you- Here's something weird.
[107:49.98]Your teeth make up a huge amount of the way that you look.
[107:54.68]That doesn't even look like me because the teeth are different.
[107:57.82]It looks like a different fucking person.
[108:00.92]Like, that fake mouth?
[108:03.14]It's just, I am a different person.
[108:05.55]New viewer.
[108:23.39]I remember going to places like uh... You guys know what Cold Stone is, right?
[108:42.96]Cold Stone Creamery did this thing where any time you got a tip, any time you tipped anybody from Cold Stone, they would have to sing this tip song.
[108:51.61]And I remember always just thinking, like, they don't want, like, hey guys, we got a tip.
[108:56.11]A tip just came in and we're really hip.
[108:59.34]And you could just tell it was like, I don't want to fucking sing that.
[109:01.78]So I would just, I would put money in and be like, don't, you don't have to.
[109:04.82]Just give it, just don't have to, you don't have to do it.
[109:06.76]I'm just going to say you did.
[109:07.94]Yeah, I know you don't, you don't want to, you don't have to.
[109:09.72]If they wanted to, sure.
[109:11.38]I would sit there and fold my arms and be like, let me hear it.
[109:15.50]I thought he just ran away.
[109:34.24]Kid, this is white hot.
[109:36.10]We snag a collector.
[109:37.96]We're big league.
[109:39.14]Psychic mercenaries.
[109:40.10]You with the brain, me with the Rolodex.
[109:41.56]Sing the bit song.
[109:43.20]The hell it does.
[109:44.14]I shelled out cash four years ago.
[109:45.92]So you say.
[109:47.36]Don't you get it?
[109:48.86]Lexi never died.
[109:50.71]A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.
[109:54.93]Max Mirage?
[109:55.97]No, Wayne Newton.
[109:57.39]Come on, kid.
[109:58.37]Get with it.
[109:59.01]Yes, he does have a rat.
[110:00.25]Yes, he does.
[110:00.63]Okay, here we go.
[110:06.28]This is it.
[110:07.36]This is where it's going to... The path is going to branch here at this point because I'm not going to run.
[110:11.04]No, I got to tape my ankles.
[110:14.02]Let her rip.
[110:39.47]don't move the real thing yeah did the Earth move oh man this is bush league this is bush league this wasn't the deal you're right I feel just terrible
[111:10.54]Um... Did she just take his hair piece off?
[111:15.82]I'm your mommy now.
[111:18.01]Okay.
[111:50.38]Holy shit.
[111:58.35]Monica, your car has got a lot of trash in it.
[112:01.93]She does that thing when she freaks out.
[112:03.03]She's like moving all the McDonald's and Wendy's bags like deep into the bottom of the seat.
[112:07.19]Like, fuck, fuck.
[112:08.09]You know, living out of my car.
[112:10.53]You know, like we all do.
[112:13.99]You just take your hand and you drag it across the backseat, desperately trying to make room and hope there's no stains.
[112:27.70]What's wrong with me?
[112:28.52]Too much DMT?
[112:39.47]I love your blouse.
[112:41.17]I'll tell you what.
[112:42.34]You find the fourth collector, huh?
[112:45.02]And then you let the village idiot make a special delivery.
[112:48.54]And then maybe... No, that's not the ending that I want.
[112:56.67]I've always wanted a pet.
[113:04.91]Eric.
[113:06.65]Come back to us.
[113:10.84]Did he just shoot the kid?
[113:16.33]He only has three otherwise you are gone forever Are you sure he's alright?
[113:24.04]Do not Ster him up lovebird Pick this
[113:31.69]What do you mean three?
[113:32.93]I leaned in so close for that.
[114:02.13]Choose me!
[114:04.81]Choose me!
[114:05.89]And she pulls up from down below the frame an envelope with the fucking Smash logo on it.
[114:10.90]Oh, she's in.
[114:38.60]If I'm so weak, why would they make me come in here again?
[114:44.09]Like, he already won.
[114:47.63]I think it's time for the powerful, psychic old lady to have a try.
[114:51.71]But her excuse was, no, no, you're weak and terrible, and you suck, but you do it again.
[115:00.44]That's all I got from that.
[115:13.78]Same ending incoming.
[115:15.92]It can't be.
[115:17.86]It actually cannot be the same ending.
[115:25.76]$700 console, by the way, Omega Lola.
[115:27.40]It wasn't that much money.
[115:30.46]Although, like, I'll sell one to you if that's what you want to pay for it.
[115:33.69]Don't squeeze me out.
[115:39.23]But she's a Corellian.
[115:41.15]And so.
[115:43.15]Protogenic.
[115:51.76]Why can't they all be full screen?
[115:55.48]Why does it have to be in the tiny little window?
[115:59.08]This doesn't even look bad.
[116:00.24]Why is it?
[116:00.93]Why do they have to put it so small?
[116:04.73]Well.
[116:06.05]Trouble in the rat hole.
[116:08.07]Monica's up there.
[116:09.57]Top floor.
[116:11.38]I guess you couldn't see the icons, huh?
[116:14.56]I'm not gonna get the same ending.
[116:46.26]Is this a great country or what?
[116:49.42]Mirage Quest.
[116:50.92]What a scam.
[116:52.02]You know, only in America could someone declare war on depression.
[116:56.00]Depression's very important to Kuralians.
[116:58.06]It makes all that boredom seem somehow... Wait, did you say Kuralians?
[117:03.22]What was Superman?
[117:03.86]A room full of sponge cake, every crumb in love with Lexi.
[117:06.97]A humble beginning.
[117:08.01]To what end?
[117:09.35]Good seats at the ballpark.
[117:10.87]Flank steak whenever I want.
[117:12.39]Krypton.
[117:12.83]Unlimited.
[117:13.57]What was he?
[117:14.75]You want Corellia on its knees.
[117:18.22]Klingon.
[117:18.74]No, no, no, no.
[117:20.32]No.
[117:21.54]Just a little bitter.
[117:26.70]So you've brought a toy.
[117:28.78]You are prepared.
[117:29.70]Superman was a Klingon.
[117:32.04]Cold feet.
[117:33.73]I'm not surprised.
[117:35.83]A Kryptonian?
[117:36.85]Oh shit, this is getting weird.
[117:39.05]This is how you do it.
[118:00.53]No wasted motion.
[118:02.29]No parlor tricks.
[118:04.79]Say goodbye to the girl.
[118:07.02]Go to the car.
[118:08.96]No.
[118:10.40]Harder.
[118:11.92]Don't you want to see her cry?
[118:13.68]You think I need your help?
[118:16.66]You think I want you watching me?
[118:18.60]You're a cheerleader, a throw rug.
[118:20.99]Now move!
[118:22.87]Go!
[118:25.01]Good boy.
[118:27.03]That is good boy.
[118:29.29]Nobody wants to burn you.
[118:32.11]Just bring me the toy.
[118:34.73]These are the good times.
[118:38.03]Okay, hand it over.
[118:41.59]It's a simple game, really.
[118:42.71]I don't want to play the game, though.
[118:43.97]I don't touch anything.
[118:48.07]You have your ugly thoughts.
[118:50.97]I don't get it.
[118:51.33]How do I lose?
[118:55.81]I have mine.
[119:02.18]He is scared of the cat.
[119:03.70]That was the right call.
[119:08.76]Alright, so now we lose.
[119:14.09]We have to lose this.
[119:16.39]I don't want to accidentally win.
[119:17.53]Alright, how about this one?
[119:18.83]Take the bracelet.
[119:21.23]The doll.
[119:23.03]And red square.
[119:24.53]And then, I don't know, this guy.
[119:25.86]Okay.
[119:34.35]Okay, let's take the let's take the doll and put it over to cigarette I Can tell which hidden the little bogeyman that scares you in the dark he works with me now he tells me all your secrets You're a little burnt up aren't you as if I needed a handicap I
[120:00.20]Cigarette on two.
[120:01.84]Alright, that's two in a row.
[120:11.18]Not the same ending.
[120:12.02]Okay, now we're going to do red square to lady, right?
[120:20.05]Doesn't she destroy red square?
[120:22.53]Yep.
[120:25.03]Hmm, that one was particularly tasty.
[120:29.48]The damn thing is rigged!
[120:31.34]Well, take notes.
[120:33.42]For some other lifetime.
[120:36.98]Okay, time to lose.
[120:40.84]Game over.
[120:41.92]All aboard!
[120:50.81]Anyone want a ride?
[120:52.05]Yep, that's me.
[120:53.85]The babbling idiot and his new best friend.
[120:59.44]You're still a little part of me that's really smart.
[121:02.73]That knows what's going on.
[121:04.83]I want ice cream too!
[121:06.69]Just doesn't get out much.
[121:07.83]Did have that hair.
[121:16.18]Yeah, that was really not worth watching the whole like 26 minute movie again.
[121:22.42]To just say I want ice cream in jail.
[121:27.78]It's not worth it at all, actually.
[121:29.34]It wasn't even the right one.
[121:33.48]Yeah, it was.
[121:33.96]It's Moki's Playmate.
[121:36.20]You get that by not doing anything.
[121:41.13]Alright, let's move on.
[121:43.35]That was a meaty one, though.
[121:44.73]I knew that was going to take at least a couple hours.
[121:47.71]We're going to move on to... We're in the 3D.
[121:50.81]I might as well stay on it.
[121:51.77]We're going to play a game called I'm Mercenary.
[121:55.90]I'm Mercenary.
[121:59.63]Fucking Christ, finally.
[122:02.11]Hey.
[122:05.65]Hey, come on, man.
[122:10.51]Enemy Spider-Man?
[122:11.56]No, I'm Mercenary.
[122:12.74]Uh, it looks pretty bizarre, but let's, uh... You know, we'll take a break, too.
[122:18.94]Just a quick one.
[122:20.98]Let's go pee.
[122:22.00]Grab the water.
[122:24.02]And I'll be back in two minutes.
[122:25.72]We're gonna play I, Mercenary.
[122:28.26]In a sec.
[126:10.61]Why are you all sleeping?
[126:13.15]Why are you all sleeping?
[126:17.90]Okay.
[126:21.60]I, Mercenary, probably should change the title to just Retro.
[126:30.39]Alright, let's go.
[126:44.63]I have no idea how good this game might be at fucking dud.
[126:49.46]It looks wild.
[126:51.78]So we'll find out.
[126:52.50]A 3DO experience.
[127:03.08]How much did EA have to do with this?
[127:10.09]The games are exclusive EA games.
[127:11.97]Did they make it?
[127:13.31]Were they part of the process?
[127:14.65]There's a lot of EA games.
[127:27.86]Move.
[127:29.74]Satellite intercept.
[127:30.92]Pick HQ.
[127:34.60]Transmission.
[127:36.89]For your own sake, for the children's sake, and the sake of every generation to come, listen to me and behold your future.
[127:46.58]After 10,000 years, I'm free.
[127:49.64]It's time to conquer Earth.
[127:53.30]Your children's children will become enslaved and forced to fight each other to the death unless you listen to what I say.
[128:01.71]I know what must be done, but I am powerless to act on my own.
[128:07.43]The person was just sleeping in a chair in the top left.
[128:11.88]Can you scroll it a little slower?
[128:37.66]That's not me.
[128:38.28]That's not me.
[128:46.71]Copyright 1995.
[128:47.93]You just took me out, man.
[128:48.87]Keep the flatline thing there.
[128:51.75]You just pulled me out.
[128:56.22]New jump.
[128:57.18]Okay.
[128:59.88]All I can do is new jump.
[129:03.48]Day 211, near Little Rock.
[129:06.34]Okay.
[129:07.22]We're going to the Ghostbusters?
[129:13.51]Dr. Collier!
[129:17.45]What happened?
[129:32.27]Why do they all have syringes?
[129:35.31]No!
[129:35.55]I thought it was going to shatter.
[129:52.89]That's actually what would happen if you got pulled out of the Matrix, by the way.
[130:07.70]Help destruct?
[130:23.32]All these tales.
[130:24.54]Could it be?
[130:24.98]It's going to be that guy from the unsolved mysteries thing.
[130:29.87]Some of these are fiction, some of these are fact.
[130:32.11]Can you find out which one?
[130:35.39]In Crazy Stories.
[130:44.54]This one, huh, this one was real.
[130:47.02]I know, real fucked up, I know.
[130:48.16]Monothan Frakes, yes.
[131:05.05]It's the day to analyze it quick.
[131:14.20]I don't think I want to go into that.
[131:23.85]It's clearly just a dentist chair.
[131:25.49]No, it's a barber's chair with a headband on it.
[131:33.51]Gamer coffin.
[131:46.43]We haven't determined what happened yet.
[131:49.37]But be careful in this area.
[131:51.83]This is where we lost contact with number four.
[131:54.63]Sorry, I think somebody may have hit the side of the TV with a hammer.
[131:57.97]I think they're ready whenever you are.
[131:59.45]So you can't really tell what the hell's going on here.
[132:01.12]Neither can I.
[132:04.52]Waveform status.
[132:05.86]Approaching synchronization now.
[132:08.93]Waveform sync.
[132:10.73]Check.
[132:11.49]Interference patterns.
[132:12.99]0.5 milliseconds.
[132:14.59]Forward.
[132:16.13]Going in.
[132:16.63]Ready to link.
[132:17.75]Jump in.
[132:18.17]3, 2, 1.
[132:18.35]Let's go.
[132:19.91]We in?
[132:40.10]What it feels like to be in an MRI.
[132:45.48]What the hell is going on?
[132:48.41]Gamer?
[132:54.83]This is not what I thought this was going to be.
[132:58.42]Enter the playground to face Balkan.
[133:06.73]It really is just a game.
[133:07.75]It's just a video warning.
[133:08.77]Low defense.
[133:09.53]Red spire required.
[133:10.71]Are these teammates?
[133:23.02]Are you... Am I out of ammo?
[133:24.50]Dude, it's a battle royale.
[133:30.64]Wait a minute.
[133:31.04]Where am I going to go?
[133:39.06]I spent all the money on the elaborate intro.
[133:43.53]What's this?
[133:43.91]I just picked that person up.
[133:50.57]Wait, I think we're capping the point.
[133:57.38]Are we?
[134:00.98]What's this?
[134:01.42]D, O, A. What is that up there?
[134:08.18]Alright, I killed that person.
[134:10.48]I'm rank 255.
[134:11.54]I need to go find a red spire.
[134:17.22]Okay, let's go.
[134:18.02]This is a blue spire.
[134:22.76]It's not what I want.
[134:25.13]Red spire.
[134:25.65]Is it on the map?
[134:32.15]No.
[134:32.89]It's blue.
[134:36.24]Blue?
[134:37.40]Also blue?
[134:38.02]I think it passed out.
[134:40.10]Ranked... Is that what he said?
[134:43.92]Is this the type of game that you would see in a Mountain Dew commercial?
[135:02.55]It's like a game that you would see on the background of when a TV show tries to show you what a video game is.
[135:16.96]Okay, I'm going back in.
[135:25.22]Total jumps 1, rank 255, vital.
[135:29.60]Okay, defense, offense, and agility.
[135:32.97]Ammo algorithms.
[135:34.49]That agility is green.
[135:35.13]Offense is red.
[135:35.71]Defense is yellow.
[135:36.35]Effectiveness, 34%.
[135:36.93]Alright, let's jump.
[135:38.08]Mountain Dew commercial.
[136:00.50]Okay, would you be the test subject back in like the mid-90s to play a game like that if you got to be in VR for like 10 minutes?
[136:09.60]Okay, let's see if I can figure this out.
[136:15.49]Yeah, and that Mountain Dew commercial the whole time would be like, hey, with two top boxes, you can level up.
[136:25.49]You sent in five labels.
[136:27.79]You'll get 200 XP points.
[136:35.15]Take your game to the next level.
[136:37.84]And the person has a huge fucking headset on.
[136:39.38]They always just have a gigantic headset on.
[136:42.28]And they like put their hands in the air and they scream, yeah!
[136:49.86]Alright, I'm in yellow right now.
[136:51.08]Should I just hold it?
[136:51.90]Just hold this?
[136:58.97]Alright, red.
[137:02.53]The music's not bad?
[137:03.65]No, it's not.
[137:04.21]It's alright.
[137:07.22]Alright, red.
[137:12.46]The bars are going up.
[137:15.16]Okay, I'm standing in the red.
[137:18.04]Is that... The red bar is going up.
[137:20.61]That's offense, right?
[137:25.90]That guy's 256?
[137:27.98]Did they explain any of this?
[137:33.04]No, no, no.
[137:33.46]Somebody died in the chair.
[137:35.68]Now I have to come in here and do... This guy is kicking the shit out of me.
[137:42.52]That guy just destroyed me.
[137:43.68]I didn't even get a chance.
[137:50.73]That was close, Five.
[137:52.33]You've got to keep moving in there.
[137:55.67]You're on your own.
[137:57.35]We can only observe and advise.
[137:59.05]Now you're set again.
[138:01.58]Here are your stats.
[138:03.62]So you guys just got to see in real time the reason why I don't play online multiplayer games anymore.
[138:09.64]That's my experience.
[138:14.21]I just got in it, Caelid.
[138:15.01]I'm running around this corner.
[138:15.87]Oh, I got hit, hit, hit, hit.
[138:17.41]Every single thing.
[138:18.53]I got, like, triple tapped.
[138:20.91]I'm dead.
[138:22.21]Oh.
[138:22.92]Okay, well, I guess I'm gonna start again.
[138:24.18]Oh, I got hit in the air, and then hit in the air, and then juggled and hit in the air again.
[138:28.34]Alright, I think it's gonna open up Minecraft.
[138:33.57]Let's jump again.
[138:43.34]Ammo algorithm.
[138:44.30]Yeah, I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[138:52.18]That song sucks.
[138:54.48]Okay, keep moving.
[139:00.71]What happened?
[139:02.41]I just killed a yellow.
[139:05.13]Okay, just keep walking.
[139:06.91]It's blue.
[139:07.45]What does blue do?
[139:09.77]Blue is making my defense go up.
[139:14.64]And offense.
[139:15.26]Alright, keep moving.
[139:15.76]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[139:16.60]Don't stop.
[139:25.18]Good.
[139:27.32]Good.
[139:27.50]Alright, keep going.
[139:29.56]Warning, low agility.
[139:30.54]Rest for a while.
[139:31.28]I have to stop?
[139:33.96]Low agility.
[139:34.44]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[139:35.18]I'm stopped.
[139:36.94]I can only walk a certain distance.
[139:38.93]I get it.
[139:39.29]Okay.
[139:42.45]Into a bonfire.
[139:43.31]Hold on.
[139:45.26]What's this thing?
[139:46.62]Like an eye?
[139:47.14]I have to kill it?
[139:47.92]Touch it?
[139:48.24]High explosive area effect ammo uses 10 units per blast.
[139:59.01]Did I get it?
[139:59.49]I think I got it.
[140:07.01]Hold on, this is red.
[140:09.73]Rest for a second.
[140:17.17]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[140:18.25]This is like Blue's base.
[140:19.19]Pick that up.
[140:19.54]What is it?
[140:21.04]I don't know.
[140:21.36]I didn't touch it.
[140:24.86]I just missed everything.
[140:25.86]I missed every single shot on that guy.
[140:27.76]And he was like a level one scrub.
[140:36.91]Warning, low agility.
[140:37.61]I know, I know, I know.
[140:38.19]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[140:42.00]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[140:44.53]Shit, I'm gonna... Come on, dude.
[140:55.09]What the fuck?
[140:58.29]No.
[141:01.50]When does my brain shut off?
[141:02.86]...before his energy level spiked right when he ran through that static field.
[141:07.30]Do you suppose that's what caused his algorithm to crash?
[141:11.55]I don't know.
[141:12.51]No.
[141:12.79]I have a feeling there's more to it than that.
[141:14.35]Jim, I think there's a little more to it.
[141:15.47]I think it's just not very good.
[141:16.51]Here's your stats.
[141:20.03]Let us know when you're ready.
[141:23.83]This guy lied on his resume.
[141:28.59]It says he was he said it's any prestige three times in Call of Duty Black Ops.
[141:34.95]I mean, that's true.
[141:36.37]That doesn't mean anything, though.
[141:38.33]It just means he sat there and just got experience over and over again.
[141:41.26]This guy's not even good at anything.
[141:43.26]You hired this guy on Prestige alone?
[141:46.12]You really fucked the whole thing up, didn't you, Mike?
[141:48.54]Only on Prestige 3.
[141:49.36]Prestige 3, goddammit.
[142:01.86]You can sit in the corner of a lobby and get to Prestige 99 in three months.
[142:13.25]The Devil XP Mountain Dew.
[142:18.47]Let's look at how big this is.
[142:21.31]We probably shouldn't have given him all those cans of Mountain Dew.
[142:24.68]What is this?
[142:31.77]Uh... What did we just stumble upon?
[142:37.45]Do I get to select a unit?
[142:52.57]Wait a minute, this is cool.
[142:56.01]I can talk?
[143:02.49]what who is where is what who is what is effect what is pusher it knocks people out of your way where is effect it's everywhere you can't get away from it where is stunner wherever you find it I guess
[143:29.74]This is the shittiest eight ball I've ever shook in my whole life.
[143:32.71]There's all the same answer.
[143:37.21]Perfect.
[143:38.37]Where reality ends and the dream begins.
[143:41.97]That was the slogan they hit us with when they launched this thing.
[143:45.62]A new frontier in virtual reality, they said.
[143:49.68]What they didn't say was that this is the final frontier.
[143:54.30]Oh.
[143:54.40]Well, that's kind of cool.
[143:56.24]It's like Star Trek.
[143:57.86]Okay, goodbye.
[144:04.73]What do you have to say?
[144:05.37]Did I somehow accidentally beat the game?
[144:08.61]How do I get higher rank?
[144:15.97]What is the garden?
[144:16.83]What is Perfect One?
[144:18.13]What is Ash Flay?
[144:20.02]What is Chafe?
[144:21.36]What is Boomerang?
[144:23.24]What is a... a PEMS?
[144:25.36]Okay.
[144:26.06]Was that actually penis?
[144:40.67]Was that like a how dare you don't ask me that question?
[144:45.01]Nothing really.
[144:48.21]What is the garden?
[144:49.99]The garden is perfect and perfect is the garden.
[144:54.43]Where is the garden?
[144:56.69]Wherever we are, that is the garden.
[145:00.59]Where is perfect one?
[145:02.69]Perfect one is dead.
[145:05.51]Oh.
[145:07.13]Oh no.
[145:09.22]Who is perfect one?
[145:10.56]A liar and a lie.
[145:13.45]There is no perfect one.
[145:15.07]So perfect one is dead though.
[145:18.13]Where's Roberto?
[145:19.73]Roberto is sixth in the hierarchy.
[145:22.15]He's the crazy one.
[145:24.05]Or maybe we're all crazy and he's sane.
[145:28.90]Goodbye.
[145:29.32]So can I pick one of these?
[145:37.98]What the fuck is that?
[145:42.03]What is this thing?
[145:49.05]Like a fly?
[145:49.89]I've been watching you.
[145:54.53]I see everything, you know?
[145:59.21]Okay, what is the garden?
[146:03.67]The garden is good.
[146:07.29]Oh, I said what is the garden, not how is the garden.
[146:14.28]What is perfect?
[146:18.00]It's everything and nothing.
[146:22.10]No, no, I didn't say why.
[146:23.28]Computer program.
[146:24.26]A universe.
[146:27.76]A dream.
[146:29.46]It's all we have.
[146:35.00]Okay.
[146:36.20]Let's say, where is the garden?
[146:38.64]There is nothing but the garden.
[146:42.64]Are these people in the computer?
[146:43.92]Are these people with me in the game?
[146:45.46]Are these other gamers?
[146:48.45]Is that like a cool transmog this person has?
[146:50.69]I don't understand.
[146:51.99]Are these other gamers?
[146:58.53]Wait, hold on.
[147:02.57]This became a completely different game.
[147:04.29]Okay, who is the garden?
[147:11.16]It's the same thing as perfect.
[147:13.68]Okay, enough of this bullshit.
[147:15.40]What is it?
[147:16.16]I don't know.
[147:16.88]A lot of people have been killed around the East Residential District lately, though.
[147:21.06]Thank you for the info.
[147:21.98]And no one's seen anything.
[147:23.66]What?
[147:24.00]Oh.
[147:24.22]Makes you wonder.
[147:26.12]Um... Okay.
[147:28.48]What is a cannibal?
[147:29.68]It increases your offensive capabilities.
[147:32.24]Okay, goodbye.
[147:32.64]Alright, which one should I touch?
[147:37.99]Should I touch, like, the five head?
[147:44.35]Oh, that person's naked.
[147:45.65]Um... I can't activate any of these things?
[147:51.58]Okay, well, I'm just gonna leave.
[148:08.10]The prophecy of porn week is true.
[148:12.30]The door sees is neutral.
[148:14.22]Enter to heal.
[148:15.50]Oh, shit.
[148:16.22]Oh, they're trying to go in to heal.
[148:21.31]Are I just camping and wait for them all to come out?
[148:24.51]Yeah.
[148:27.11]Jim, he's using his tried and true tactic of Call of Duty XP boosting.
[148:30.73]This is how he got his prestige.
[148:32.45]I told you this guy was the real deal.
[148:35.41]He's spawn camping.
[148:43.53]This got me right in the fucking head.
[148:48.64]And when he finds a good player, he runs the fuck away.
[148:50.68]Let's heal.
[148:53.98]Find a red spire.
[148:56.26]Wait, there are new players here.
[148:57.42]There are people here again.
[148:58.56]This really is just like, okay, wait, I want to talk to this guy.
[149:04.43]This is other players.
[149:13.93]uh where is ice if you think you can handle Tesla try looking around the power plant what is perfect one the ultimate virtual warrior he's never been defeated in combat and he's been here since the beginning because a perfect one is the rank one where where are they the spire the spire okay
[149:46.24]This person hit a hundred times on character generator.
[149:48.86]Okay.
[149:52.98]Well, what the hell is this?
[150:00.43]Uh, what is... Heh.
[150:02.31]A grenade, more or less.
[150:09.63]This is like Dr. Manhattan's friend.
[150:11.95]Dr. Charcoal.
[150:16.02]A stun gun.
[150:17.14]It's a stunner.
[150:23.09]I don't know where in the real world I entered in Palo Alto.
[150:28.59]You can make the jump anywhere in the country.
[150:31.13]At least you used to be able to.
[150:33.40]I have no idea what's happening on the outside.
[150:35.44]This is a side hang to say that that was a lie.
[150:41.15]I don't know where in the real world I entered in Palo Alto.
[150:46.65]You can make the jump anywhere in the country.
[150:49.19]At least you used to be able to.
[150:51.45]I have no idea what's happening on the outside anymore.
[150:56.27]This, somebody just said this would have been really cool to play back then.
[150:58.85]Yeah, it would have.
[151:01.95]I mean, nowadays, not so much, but still is pretty interesting.
[151:13.64]Okay, somebody said to go to the east side?
[151:15.64]Why do we all have to fight each other out here?
[151:20.07]Oh, shit.
[151:29.19]Okay.
[151:30.13]I'm gonna go... I'm gonna run away.
[151:31.25]Let's go over here.
[151:33.99]Is there a building I can go over here?
[151:35.49]Can I go in here?
[151:35.97]I think I might be able to go in this.
[151:40.32]Alright, slow down.
[151:46.50]Can I go in this?
[151:50.17]Enter the pyramid to face Medusa.
[151:53.55]I wasn't ready to face Medusa?
[151:55.41]Uh-oh.
[152:10.91]Uh-oh.
[152:13.67]This is gonna... Shit.
[152:17.13]Watch out.
[152:17.47]I'm gonna go this way.
[152:29.03]Where is she?
[152:31.47]Agility's bad.
[152:32.13]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[152:34.31]I think she's gonna wrap around me, right?
[152:40.26]Offense is it not terrible my defense is so bad though I'm gonna spam as fast as I can when I see her It's gonna be like oh Shit
[153:02.37]What happens if I win?
[153:04.63]She's rank 11!
[153:05.73]I'm about to be a 255 versus an 11.
[153:07.69]If I win, I get to 10.
[153:08.61]I just got one-shot.
[153:34.35]Did you see the energy spike when Five ran through that static field?
[153:38.09]That's the same thing that happened to Number Four.
[153:40.39]Yeah, but Four's algorithms crashed right after he did that.
[153:44.51]Yes, but it wasn't the static field.
[153:46.69]The only thing the static field did was raise his levels.
[153:50.14]This proves it.
[153:52.58]Five, we may be on to something here.
[153:57.45]Run through the static fields of the next few rhythms you crash so we can gather some more data.
[154:02.39]Run through the fields?
[154:03.25]If this theory is correct, we may be able to permanently increase your power.
[154:07.88]Wait, I'm supposed to be dying?
[154:10.92]Let us know when you're ready.
[154:17.01]I'm supposed to die and run through the field and stuff.
[154:20.39]Okay.
[154:22.51]Get more power.
[154:24.45]I lost agility and lost defense.
[154:27.68]Alright, we gotta run through a static field.
[154:29.26]What the hell does a static field look like?
[154:41.11]Kill enemies, collect their static.
[154:43.65]Start and select to return to the lab.
[154:45.29]Okay.
[154:47.95]Collect this- I just- Okay, I got static.
[154:57.02]I get it.
[154:57.34]Alright, cool.
[154:57.68]Should I touch that?
[154:59.26]A weird pool ball.
[155:01.82]High power, long range blaster.
[155:03.30]Uses three zero units.
[155:04.44]Alright, so I think I collected that.
[155:07.80]Low agility, rest for a while.
[155:08.92]So what if I press start?
[155:11.00]Select ammo.
[155:12.86]Oh shit, look at this.
[155:17.00]Default, default.
[155:18.06]What's this one?
[155:20.36]Ammo.
[155:22.06]Give all messages.
[155:23.94]Information only.
[155:25.32]Warnings only.
[155:34.15]Okay, let's go back.
[155:35.21]Select.
[155:36.71]No, I can't do it yet, I don't think.
[155:41.98]I get it.
[155:42.92]Okay, alright, alright.
[155:43.96]So... There, I'm level 255.
[155:49.02]I have to only kill 255s.
[155:51.08]Do they just keep me in here overnight?
[155:57.06]Okay.
[156:14.03]You're a prisoner.
[156:14.65]I don't think I'm a prisoner.
[156:15.49]Alright, let me try this a couple more times.
[156:19.62]So I have to run around and kill a bunch of things that are my level.
[156:22.00]So we're only looking for shitty players.
[156:25.38]Avoid everybody else.
[156:29.04]Earn messages back on.
[156:29.98]Okay.
[156:38.05]Warning, low defense.
[156:40.23]Give me that static.
[156:41.77]I need- I'm already dead.
[156:44.59]Static.
[156:54.51]Okay.
[156:56.85]Static.
[156:58.21]Static.
[156:59.83]Okay, now what?
[157:01.46]Select ammo.
[157:05.70]How do I get out?
[157:06.14]How do I do?
[157:09.76]You should be strafing.
[157:10.72]There's no strafing.
[157:16.42]There's so many people over here.
[157:25.61]Your DOA levels are getting dangerously low.
[157:29.31]You can't take many more hits like that.
[157:30.79]Can you give me a flamethrower or something?
[157:32.15]You've got to find a way to do better.
[157:41.31]What's this game called?
[157:41.97]It's called I, Mercenary.
[157:43.65]Alright, I keep losing shit permanently.
[157:47.18]Okay, if I run around fast, I run out of agility and the game says stop moving.
[157:56.80]And when I stop moving, a guy 50 levels higher than me shoots me in the head and kills me.
[158:04.90]It's like a new map.
[158:09.76]Alright.
[158:10.58]Static.
[158:12.06]God damn it.
[158:14.00]I don't have any ammo.
[158:17.48]Alright.
[158:18.20]I'm done.
[158:18.58]I'm done.
[158:19.52]Moving on.
[158:31.92]New game.
[158:32.54]I'm about to- This is ridiculous.
[158:34.62]A definite improvement in target acquisition and kill ratio.
[158:37.48]No, it wasn't.
[158:37.84]I didn't kill anybody.
[158:39.40]That's good.
[158:41.40]We're ready to send you back inside.
[158:42.52]Stop gaslighting me because I'm the only fucking person that signed up for this experiment for $40.
[158:46.70]Alright, last one, last one, last one.
[158:58.65]One more.
[159:07.02]Stop gaslighting the word gaslighting.
[159:11.48]Like the word has feeling.
[159:12.52]Alright, I gotta at least do something interesting.
[159:15.72]Alright.
[159:17.25]Why my shit is so low?
[159:18.75]Look at how big that bar can be.
[159:23.43]What the fuck, dude?
[159:24.81]Where am I supposed to go?
[159:26.11]What do you have to say now?
[159:34.43]Nothing.
[159:38.99]It doesn't have anything to say.
[159:46.22]In fact, I think they may have... I don't think very many people still work here.
[159:49.78]That guy might be the janitor, for all I know.
[160:00.91]Run from spire to spire.
[160:02.29]Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
[160:08.15]Stay near the pyre.
[160:09.31]You need to kill higher rank than 256.
[160:12.73]Alright, I'm just gonna go... Fire.
[160:17.40]Okay, cool.
[160:18.16]If I stay still, I'm gonna die.
[160:22.00]Why is my agility so bad?
[160:25.16]I can only walk for two seconds.
[160:31.82]What's the point of having traffic lights?
[160:35.66]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[160:36.81]It's so slow.
[160:47.13]I'm soft locked.
[160:54.56]No, don't put me back in.
[160:55.56]Can I please eat something?
[161:15.08]I think we ran out of FMV sequences, so we're just gonna get the basic ones.
[161:19.74]Alright, when I kill the green guys, do I get green stuff?
[161:35.35]Alright, I can almost make it to the blue.
[161:40.44]I'm almost there.
[161:41.30]Low agility.
[161:45.69]I think I just died from being too tired.
[161:47.41]Alright, that's it, I'm out.
[161:48.44]Pull me out.
[161:51.22]Pull me out, I'm done.
[161:52.86]That's it, I've done it.
[161:53.74]Wake up, Vibe.
[161:55.42]Come on, open your eyes.
[161:59.55]Pay close attention to this.
[162:01.33]It could make the difference in the success of our mission.
[162:06.81]So far with every rhythm you've crashed, when you run through the static field, it increases your power levels.
[162:13.45]How long we don't know.
[162:15.27]So I've been running some tests.
[162:16.61]This is jermaPluto.
[162:17.59]By using the Huffman encoding and interleaving, we can capture those static algorithms and then permanently add their power to your projection into perfect.
[162:25.80]Get to the point.
[162:27.40]The more rhythms you can crash in in Huffman, the more powerful you'll become.
[162:32.03]And the better your chances of attaining our mission objective.
[162:35.85]Gain all the power you can this way.
[162:37.83]You'll need it.
[162:39.07]Why didn't you tell me this?
[162:41.25]Like 18 days ago when I got into the machine.
[162:46.99]Wasn't somebody in this before?
[162:48.51]Somebody died in this thing.
[162:49.55]You don't think they had the data before?
[162:51.67]Alright, one more.
[162:56.22]One more.
[162:56.98]This is it.
[162:57.72]And then I'm done.
[162:58.18]This is it.
[162:59.64]Last one.
[163:00.06]This is the actual final one.
[163:01.40]This is the last one.
[163:11.14]This is it.
[163:11.64]I promise.
[163:21.71]Alright.
[163:22.59]Agility done.
[163:24.31]No more ammo.
[163:28.06]Okay, fucking about.
[163:28.82]Take me out.
[163:31.20]I love this game.
[163:31.94]Don't stop.
[163:38.04]Run into the static fields.
[163:39.44]I died.
[163:40.44]Nobody even shot me.
[163:41.50]No one shot me.
[163:42.64]I've run out of lives.
[163:43.50]I've gotta go.
[163:45.26]Okay.
[163:45.82]It's time to move on.
[163:46.76]I don't even care anymore.
[163:55.23]I'm just being tortured in here.
[163:58.71]Like, can you at least... Just wake me up and just give me a Red Bull.
[164:04.68]I feel like I would have a little bit more opportunity to succeed.
[164:08.78]Stop just waking me up and putting me back to sleep, dude.
[164:11.16]Alright, that was I, Mercenary.
[164:13.88]That was pretty fun.
[164:14.46]Just restart the game.
[164:15.85]We're going to play another one.
[164:17.55]What do I want to do now?
[164:18.97]Alright, here comes a mystery.
[164:20.41]You have no idea what it's going to be, but it's going to be a mystery.
[164:23.51]That's all you know.
[164:24.33]Give me one second.
[166:20.62]Okay, so this one coming up here is completely in Japanese.
[166:25.25]I have no idea what's going to happen here, but this is called Montana Jones.
[166:30.57]You're going to have to help me out here.
[166:34.45]Out of this, probably about 6,000 people or one of you know how to speak Japanese.
[166:44.06]Okay.
[166:53.83]Somebody will.
[167:05.96]It's a cat Indiana Jones.
[167:07.86]Oh.
[167:12.55]Wait a minute.
[167:13.75]This is wacky wasters.
[167:15.79]Same company.
[167:26.66]I'm in now I'm excited because wacky races was awesome Nice
[167:56.57]Antena Jones.
[167:58.07]Fully animated?
[168:21.63]He's like facetiming like a grand kid.
[168:25.41]Fucking funny faces.
[168:27.53]It's Zelda CDI.
[168:31.31]It's not.
[168:32.29]It's better than that.
[168:32.95]Okay, Montana?
[168:40.06]Alfred or Melissa?
[168:53.54]Give me the gist of it.
[168:54.16]Give me the gist of it.
[168:54.70]Give me the gist.
[168:55.16]What does it say?
[168:55.80]I can't select anybody.
[168:58.38]What the fuck was that?
[169:00.18]Did I take too long?
[169:24.02]Alright, where are we gonna go?
[169:25.16]San Francisco, the Caribbean Sea, Peru, England, Egypt, Tibet, or SofaFet?
[169:33.21]SofaFet.
[169:36.55]San Francisco or SofaFet?
[169:44.21]Let's go San Francisco.
[169:53.38]Oh, you know what?
[169:53.74]It probably was like, this message will self-destruct in 10 seconds, right?
[169:56.84]I can hear it.
[169:57.42]I got that part.
[169:58.18]Oh, now what?
[169:58.98]Why does it keep exploding?
[170:05.74]Okay.
[170:25.70]We're landing in San Francisco.
[170:27.84]We're going to try to get a diamond.
[170:30.40]San Francisco.
[170:30.96]Let's ask someone.
[170:53.45]What are we looking for?
[170:53.97]What are we looking for?
[170:55.25]What are we looking for?
[170:55.81]What are we looking for?
[170:56.45]This way.
[170:56.85]What are we trying to do?
[171:04.71]This way.
[171:06.57]How about fireworks?
[171:08.97]Let's get some fireworks.
[171:13.11]We'll take a firework, please.
[171:14.31]Thank you very much.
[171:16.57]What are you going to do with the fireworks?
[171:19.16]It might be useful.
[171:23.23]Okay.
[171:28.05]Now what?
[171:29.55]I guess we'll take one.
[171:36.88]Is it puzzle time?
[171:37.52]Oh shit, I don't even know what the puzzle is.
[171:42.82]What is the puzzle?
[171:46.31]I took the first one!
[171:48.13]You never take the first one!
[171:57.56]It's okay.
[171:57.78]If I can't read it, then it won't come true.
[172:01.46]I don't know.
[172:02.00]If I can't read it, if I can't comprehend it, can't understand it, it's not going to come true.
[172:04.49]It won't be real.
[172:04.91]Translate that.
[172:09.79]What does it say?
[172:10.53]It's got cursed.
[172:30.63]Okay, what about in the, in here?
[172:33.07]Down the street, or in, let's go in here.

[173:33.68]He's like, come on over here.
[173:35.14]Come here.
[173:35.69]He says here.
[173:36.15]Please translate for me.
[173:39.11]Is it here?
[174:01.23]I'm trying, but you aren't reading my messages.

[174:30.30]Am I about to make a deal?
[174:31.90]Linkerton, what's going on here?
[174:34.73]He said welcome.
[174:35.47]He said a little more than welcome.
[174:38.59]Should I pick that up?
[174:40.15]Okay, what did he say?
[175:01.28]We just took him, weren't we supposed to?
[175:06.44]Two minutes of dialog.
[175:07.36]I'm getting destroyed.
[175:08.14]Did you bring the money?
[175:09.50]I don't think we have any money.
[175:29.43]I found this guy snooping around upstairs.
[175:35.91]Bring him!
[175:36.29]Oh, no!
[175:40.50]Stay calm, everybody.
[175:42.04]We don't know what he's planning.

[177:40.61]He says, you moron, you are going the wrong way.
[177:43.57]Does anybody have any idea what's going on?
[178:01.41]You need a paper.
[178:02.27]He might be saying, you need a paper.

[178:42.86]We can't help you go through the maze.
[178:46.70]It's all the same room.
[178:48.09]I have to memorize what I clicked on.
[179:13.73]Get me out of here.
[179:15.07]I did it!
[179:20.10]Get in there.
[179:33.46]We made it out.
[179:34.94]Nice work.
[179:35.56]Uh...
[179:51.37]Mechanic Dragon, height 5'2, weight 3'2.
[179:53.51]What is he trying- I don't- Why am I looking at this?
[179:57.71]I get to ride it?
[180:22.79]How many games are... I didn't mean to do that.
[180:28.35]This whole thing was made in dreams, by the way.
[180:35.31]Life?
[180:36.01]Why is my life a fuel gauge?
[180:40.15]Jump on his head?
[180:42.69]That didn't work?
[180:45.42]Why is there a timer?
[180:48.26]Sonic!
[180:50.10]Sonic!
[180:54.96]Get up.
[180:56.92]Don't get hit again.
[181:06.49]I just have to avoid it.
[181:10.55]Easy.
[181:17.18]Wait, secret.
[181:19.02]Oh, I did it.
[181:20.90]Let's go.
[181:24.62]go where you can run into the walls why can you do that I'm not okay I don't it's getting
[181:53.63]It's going so fast, you have no idea.
[181:59.97]Okay, well, San Francisco apparently has been destroyed.
[182:02.93]I don't know.
[182:05.51]How about England?
[182:08.57]We'll go to England.
[182:17.71]My dear disciple, Alfred and Montana.
[182:19.85]How are you?
[182:25.97]I am way more interested in this game now because of the eight different game modes that exist.
[182:31.47]Alright, let's go.
[182:34.09]Get our translator ready.
[182:55.70]This boomer unironically enjoys shit.
[182:56.98]This is an anime made into a game?
[182:59.52]I don't know.
[183:25.70]I don't think so.
[183:26.40]Maybe?
[183:31.25]Okay.
[183:31.99]So we've got cars.
[183:33.51]It is.
[183:33.73]Oh no.
[183:34.29]Translator.
[183:34.67]What was just said?
[183:35.29]I think this is important.
[183:55.91]No, yes, no, no, no, where's my translator?
[184:00.29]My chat's going too fast.
[184:04.97]Should we, should you change your name to Fart?
[184:09.71]I can't even, I, that's so dumb.
[184:12.24]Like, I can't, why did I read what you said?
[184:16.54]Alright, it wants you to, it asked you to go back to Boston.
[184:21.84]No, it didn't.
[184:25.92]They asked if you want to use the car or the taxi, but that's not a yes or a no.
[184:29.88]Do you want to use the car or the taxi?
[184:31.92]Yes.
[184:39.62]Oh, dear God.
[184:40.61]No.
[184:53.56]Do I have access to brakes?
[184:55.82]Or speed?
[185:00.76]We're going very slow.
[185:04.28]By the way, wait.
[185:05.51]You're driving this side of the road, right?
[185:17.39]You have to drive on the left side.
[185:18.25]I can't do anything.
[185:23.21]This gets a full letter grade.
[185:24.45]Technically, that's true, yeah.
[185:34.83]We're going five miles per hour.
[185:48.32]Okay.
[185:48.76]Alright.
[185:49.50]Yeah, I tried to sideswipe him, but it went fine.
[186:14.85]We made it.
[186:15.39]Looks like we're taking the taxi.
[186:20.61]Where are you off to?
[186:21.21]I don't know.
[186:21.71]It's a beautiful place, isn't it?
[186:41.02]That makes sense because we definitely didn't drive more than 300 feet away from where the taxi was.
[186:46.62]We barely pulled out of the driveway.
[186:48.26]Okay, time for another guess which way to go.
[186:49.44]God damn it.
[186:49.70]Okay.
[187:12.88]Watch that.
[187:15.70]Can't get any help from anybody.
[187:16.54]I need help.
[187:23.72]It won't help me.
[187:28.92]Watch it.
[187:31.58]What did you say?
[187:37.59]Did you say don't touch that or touch it?
[187:41.31]Translator.
[187:44.42]Holy shit, man.
[187:45.16]Montana's dumpy.
[187:50.32]Alright, now that opened this.
[188:06.19]That's the way that your dog looks at you when you're talking to them.
[188:09.57]I'm a dog and I heard my name.
[188:23.42]Did we do it?
[188:29.34]Oh shit, another one of these.
[188:30.30]It was that one.
[188:39.71]Right next to the- no.
[188:42.75]It was another one back here, right?
[188:45.03]Fuck.
[188:48.83]Down here?
[188:49.33]Pull this one.
[188:52.51]That should open up the one behind us.
[189:01.49]Theoretically, right?
[189:02.35]Then we turn left.
[189:09.84]Good.
[189:15.88]Wait, should I?
[189:16.96]Alright, that's probably that one then.
[189:18.78]Is this?
[189:21.67]This game predates the Bible.
[189:23.07]Uh.
[189:23.29]I don't know.
[189:23.87]Probably not.
[189:27.85]Okay.
[189:35.24]Straight ahead.
[189:36.86]This one might do this door.
[189:39.60]I hope.
[189:46.92]Next?
[189:47.41]No, no, no.
[189:48.13]You cannot say that right now.
[189:51.36]I- I don't think that- I don't- you really don't want to say that.
[189:54.05]That's not what you want.
[189:54.81]I'll take the sword.
[190:01.15]Is this Excalibur?
[190:07.63]Wait, that means I'm the chosen one.
[190:13.94]Something is coming towards us.
[190:21.43]I'm the chosen one.
[190:28.38]Boss fight with a sword?
[190:29.32]That would be awesome.
[190:31.84]Mechanic Mole.
[190:36.67]Yeah, but you can't wield Excalibur if you're not chosen.
[190:43.17]Doesn't it burn your hands?
[190:51.73]Castlevania?
[190:54.74]Can I use the sword for anything?
[191:04.10]This is Super Mario shit here.
[191:07.84]Look at these blocks.
[191:10.55]Don't move.
[191:17.25]This thing's gonna open.
[191:18.37]Okay, I'm fine.
[191:21.22]shit I gotta go down got it alright don't blow this it gets progressively faster
[191:51.43]Good, good, good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[191:56.77]Oh, no.
[191:57.35]Wait, that's more of this shit?
[191:59.22]I just took a brick to the head.
[192:04.18]Alright, easy, easy, easy.
[192:16.19]Ugh.
[192:21.27]I have to beat one of these levels, at least.
[192:27.36]Shit.
[192:28.36]Come on.
[192:28.92]That's bullshit.
[192:29.30]If you get touched by a brick, you go all the way back to the beginning?
[192:31.22]That's stupid.
[192:36.91]Brick checkpoints?
[192:54.32]Who the fuck are you?
[192:56.68]Wait.
[193:00.55]Who's that?
[193:11.35]Don't get hit by a brick.
[193:14.77]Alright, easy.
[193:16.04]Don't move.
[193:19.12]You tell me I was that far away.
[193:28.01]Think of this game like an ass and pretend to eat it.
[193:30.97]Alright, ban that person for at least 30 minutes.
[193:33.88]There's more of this.
[193:45.50]There's probably three.
[193:53.53]Good to know that that guy is now a part of the encounter.
[193:59.83]Stay up top.
[194:08.98]Why give me such an opportunity to not get hit?
[194:12.56]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[194:14.42]That was stupid.
[194:24.58]I won.
[194:27.38]Use your sword?
[194:27.78]I don't have the sword.
[194:29.04]I think it's just cutscene only.
[194:30.16]He said, what did we do to deserve this punishment?
[194:35.34]You guys didn't do anything.
[194:56.11]I'm gonna need some time to fix this.
[195:05.89]Please stop playing the 3DO.
[195:08.01]No, dude!
[195:08.33]What do you mean?
[195:26.11]Stop.
[195:28.65]Please stop playing the 3DO.
[195:31.57]You can't say that right now.
[195:38.44]We have to do SoFet.
[195:40.12]So I know it just looks like an F. And I made out like a Boba Fett joke and everyone thought I was pretending to be stupid.
[195:47.72]We're doing SoFet and then we're going to move on.
[195:56.09]Break this shitty fucking game.
[195:57.35]Take a bite out of it.
[195:59.07]You guys are killing me.
[196:21.30]I wonder if it's gonna explode in our office that we have to get re-renovated and rebuilt every single day that we do this.
[196:35.31]I don't think there is a Boston to Russia plane.
[196:44.09]I think you'd have to stop a few times.
[196:45.61]Is it direct Boston to Russia plane?
[196:47.47]Is there?
[196:47.79]Why not?
[196:48.09]I don't know.
[196:48.89]I just wonder if there's a gas.
[196:50.11]Okay.
[197:15.43]I don't have guns.
[197:23.52]It's literally across the whole planet.
[197:25.34]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[197:28.48]Where are you going?
[197:30.46]Please tell me there's an Aladdin when I jump on people.
[197:33.78]Come on.
[197:40.61]God damn it, there's not.
[197:50.09]How do I get by this guy?
[197:51.81]Oh, it's not just a background.
[197:53.76]It's also a foreground.
[197:54.84]I get it.
[197:55.12]No!
[197:55.84]Hooray!
[197:56.42]I don't think I did that.
[197:59.68]No!
[198:18.34]I need to get back up on there where the am I I can go through to the background background but not the background background background up there okay
[198:47.23]Shit!
[198:47.37]Does it touch me?
[198:51.53]Is it the fuel gauge?
[198:55.81]I don't know.
[198:56.35]I'm probably made out of metal or something.
[199:01.62]I don't know.
[199:02.22]I just want to play Sonic.
[199:03.46]Should I grab the chain?
[199:06.78]Alright, I'm gonna put my hand in this.
[199:11.22]Is there a... I need my translator.
[199:13.62]What does that say?
[199:15.36]Illusory wall?
[199:19.86]Are we jumping out the window?
[199:41.02]Oh, he's here.
[199:42.42]He said jump.
[199:43.22]Jump.
[199:43.58]Okay.
[199:43.94]I'm gonna jump.
[199:44.90]That was risky.
[200:13.84]That was a pretty good clear.
[200:18.10]I like that one.
[200:21.96]Did he fall?
[200:28.25]He said, bite the disk and play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[200:36.66]Okay, sure.
[200:37.20]Betcha that's what was said.
[200:45.97]I'm glad.
[200:46.43]There's no one here.
[200:47.47]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[200:49.33]I'm not good with cold.
[200:50.00]I'm glad.
[200:50.44]There's no one here.
[200:50.92]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[200:52.40]I'm not good with cold.
[200:53.04]I'm glad.
[200:53.26]There's no one here.
[200:53.76]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[200:56.22]I'm glad.
[200:56.48]There's no one here.
[200:57.24]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[200:58.32]I'm glad.
[200:58.58]There's no one here.
[200:59.40]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[201:00.40]I'm glad.
[201:00.64]There's no one here.
[201:01.70]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[201:03.74]I'm glad.
[201:04.00]There's no one here.
[201:04.64]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[201:06.13]I'm glad.
[201:06.39]There's no one here.
[201:06.79]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[201:10.43]I'm glad.
[201:10.63]There's no one here.
[201:11.11]I found the Maria statue, so let's go home.
[201:12.75]I'm glad.
[201:12.95]There's no one here.
[201:13.41]I found
[201:17.03]What are the wheels for?
[201:18.95]Do you really put aesthetic wheels on the back of a... and turn into a car?
[201:25.50]Irma, you're killing us.
[201:33.47]You're killing us!
[201:36.73]Why am I killing you?
[201:39.61]Alright.
[201:39.85]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[201:42.71]You're choking me.
[201:45.04]Get your hands off your own neck and pretending it's me.
[201:53.80]Go, go, go.
[201:57.32]It's going to fall.
[201:59.78]Oldest trick in the book.
[202:08.22]You are personally squeezing my brain juice out.
[202:11.14]This is better than the first game?
[202:13.84]No, it's not.
[202:14.58]They're both equally good.
[202:41.38]I would love to be killed by you.
[202:48.77]Alright.
[202:51.37]Not for the weird, like, I kill you fantasy.
[202:53.95]I already made that video.
[202:55.74]You can go watch it right now.
[202:56.78]You can go pull up the green screen right now and just, like, sit there and be like, bleh.
[203:00.08]Eh.
[203:07.85]You can sit there and watch the ASMR murder you video.
[203:15.84]Alright, this was funny.
[203:17.00]It was fun.
[203:18.42]What's next?
[203:25.16]You said... Yeah, that's what I just said.
[203:27.48]This one's over.
[203:34.57]I think, judging by, it's already, it's been three and a half hours.
[203:38.29]I don't think I can, I don't want to really pivot to anything else right now.
[203:42.33]I think we're going to clean this up with a really good one.
[203:47.41]The one that's coming up next is called Way of the Warrior.
[203:50.90]It is a full-on green screen, real people in like costumes fighting game.
[204:00.70]So, this is where we're going to end it tonight.
[204:02.74]We're going to pick that up.
[204:04.19]We're going to try it out.
[204:06.07]This is actually a costume fighting game, yes.
[204:14.15]We're done.
[204:15.15]Give me one second.
[204:21.47]I didn't even know what that image was.
[204:22.94]I just saw that there was an image loaded into OBS, so I didn't want to blind you with those bars, so I just put it up whatever it was.
[204:35.86]Head-to-head fighting action, huge digitized characters, 60 to 80 moves per character, and secrets to die for.
[204:42.91]Okay.
[204:49.13]You've got my attention.
[204:53.61]Here we go.
[204:55.95]This is one of Naughty Dog's earliest games.
[204:58.34]Is that really what this is?
[205:00.16]Holy fuck, you're right.
[205:01.16]I didn't know that.
[205:03.63]This is Naughty Dog's first game.
[205:10.60]That's pretty cool.
[205:12.20]Here's some gamer history for you here.
[205:18.37]Go right.
[205:32.20]How does it feel like I look like this guy?
[205:35.60]I look in the mirror sometimes.
[205:48.57]Music by White Zombie.
[205:53.03]Real band, huh?
[206:03.07]Way of the Warrior.
[206:04.41]Thanks for using my subpar translating skills.
[206:11.20]Hey, you were the one guy today.
[206:14.30]Hark and ye, for I tell a tale known of precious view, and extend a challenge to compete with the greatest warriors the world has ever known.
[206:22.83]The victor will gain entrance in the Book of Warriors, and his name will be known for centuries to come.
[206:28.37]I already love it.
[206:29.17]Although nobody knows whence the book of fighting came, it is known that it is the complete compilation of the world's greatest competitors, their methods, and their stories.
[206:39.35]Written by magic in the blood of champions, the book has been kept since before history in a mountaintop citadel in the Himalayas.
[206:46.16]It is at this citadel that the world's strongest competitors fight for inscription in the book.
[206:51.58]This is like comedy Mortal Kombat.
[206:53.64]Or is this supposed to be taken seriously?
[206:56.59]I don't know yet.
[207:06.11]Mortal Kombat is already kind of like comedy Mortal Kombat, isn't it?
[207:09.43]Find the way.
[207:09.85]C.D.I.
[207:10.01]Ganon?
[207:38.14]Okay, here we go.
[207:39.44]Game.
[207:39.84]Arena.
[207:44.50]I can't.
[207:44.94]No.
[207:45.16]Game.
[207:46.83]Arena.
[207:47.43]Names?
[207:50.83]No name.

[207:53.79]Skill.
[207:56.45]Whatever.
[207:56.71]Let's just go.

[208:47.96]Alright, let's do- Alright, I'm gonna say... Muay Thai France.
[208:57.57]I wanna do Muay Thai.
[209:02.49]Oh, I need a second controller.
[209:03.79]Uh-oh, wait.
[209:05.23]I don't want to hear any more exposition from his skull.
[209:13.31]You already did this.
[209:15.01]What?
[209:15.31]Versus mode.
[209:29.89]The graveyard.
[209:30.81]The throne room.
[209:34.29]The temple.
[209:35.61]The pit.
[209:36.17]Alright, the pit.
[209:38.59]Alright, the game is demo mode?
[209:41.73]Tournament mode.
[209:43.89]Okay, we're gonna do tournament mode at the pit.
[209:48.40]Right?
[209:51.82]We ready?
[209:52.20]There we go.
[209:54.56]Alright.
[210:04.87]What are those skulls?
[210:13.64]Those are secret characters.
[210:15.26]Are they really?
[210:32.56]It's gonna be glue man, Jax, and Scorpion.
[210:37.30]Here we go.
[210:40.40]Wait, he grows?
[210:41.98]Alright, that's a dog.
[210:45.79]Does it block?
[210:46.61]I'm getting destroyed.
[211:01.49]Is there a move list?
[211:02.87]Wait.
[211:03.09]No.
[211:03.19]Stop.
[211:03.37]Can I do moves?
[211:08.65]How did he do that?
[211:11.76]Come on.
[211:34.80]Sonic the Hedgehog!
[211:39.46]Come on!
[211:40.50]Dude, this is hard as shit!
[211:53.61]Rematch.
[211:54.41]Come on.
[211:57.83]Alright, that's upper punch.
[211:59.79]Lower punch.
[212:06.23]I'm trying to do like forward, down, forward, C. Down, forward, C. Down, back, C. Use the combo.
[212:18.18]What combo?
[212:18.83]I didn't even do a move.
[212:21.89]Hold on a minute.
[212:22.45]I need the instructions.
[212:23.19]Okay, it says...
[212:34.69]Okay, wait, wait, wait, special moves, 9, page 9.
[212:36.97]Special moves.
[212:40.99]In order to perform special moves, you need to develop some special button technique.
[212:45.29]First, it is important to remember that forward and back refer to the direction of the character- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[212:48.70]Sweep attack.
[212:49.08]Press down, then down, forward, then down, forward.
[212:53.10]What?
[212:54.48]Press D-pad down, then press D-pad down, forward, then press D-pad forward.
[213:01.24]What the fuck are you talking about?
[213:07.12]Down, down, forward, down.
[213:11.56]Skill points and magic.
[213:16.92]Push the D-pad to the back and hold for two seconds.
[213:19.06]Okay, cool.
[213:20.58]Hold the B button and push the D-pad.
[213:23.70]Alright, here we go.
[213:27.30]Special moves.
[213:27.80]Perform a sweep move, then press the left shift.
[213:31.78]Press D-pad down diagonally, then press down diagonally, D-pad down.
[213:35.29]This is written- I have to say- I have- whatever.
[213:38.50]I get it.
[213:48.34]D-pad down, then D-pad down forward, then D-pad down.
[213:50.94]I'm gonna win.
[213:54.34]D-pad down, then D-pad down forward, then D-pad down, then... Means down, down forward into forward.
[214:04.14]Okay, down, forward, down, forward, down.
[214:06.44]This is why fighting games aren't mainstream, folks.
[214:13.70]Well, I don't know about that.
[214:19.77]If I hold left, it should charge.
[214:21.13]I don't even get to do one move.
[214:30.56]He did one... Got it!
[214:34.53]Why did I get hurt by that?
[214:39.84]This is why Smash is the most popular fighting game.
[214:43.03]Omega Lull.
[214:45.35]Fox is at the bottom of the tier list.
[215:05.71]Come on!
[215:07.96]Anybody's game.
[215:08.48]Don't lose.
[215:09.04]Do a leg sweep.
[215:10.04]I'm trying, man.
[215:11.68]Please block.
[215:12.40]Okay, block.
[215:12.70]That's block.
[215:35.96]Get the fuck outta here!
[215:39.41]What was that?
[215:42.07]Round two, fight.
[216:03.88]That takes... That's frame precedence?
[216:06.00]What's with the frame precedence?
[216:07.10]Bullshit.
[216:07.34]Trying to just figure out moves.
[216:25.38]He's doing... I just got fatality.
[216:28.54]Okay.
[216:33.45]Have you found the block button?
[216:34.51]Yeah, it's B, but I can't even block.
[216:38.53]He gets to throw shit in the air.
[216:45.28]I just threw something at him.
[217:01.90]Yeah, he gets such fucking frame precedence, it's not even fair.
[217:05.81]Like, we both do move at the same time, and then his one hurts me instead of him.
[217:08.93]Instead of me hurting him.
[217:13.37]Block.
[217:14.55]Block's not gonna do shit.
[217:19.16]Block.
[217:37.64]sword versus fist I'm gonna check I'm gonna check a new character out do low heavies I don't think there is low heavy I think there's just punch and kick don't rematch alright one more try

[218:09.86]It's hard.
[218:10.78]New character.

[218:45.34]We're gonna go Shakey Jake.
[218:51.94]Don't choose a low tier.
[218:53.04]How am I supposed to know what the tier list looks like?
[218:54.94]Turn the skill level down.
[219:08.22]Alright, here we go.
[219:08.92]I get a weapon this time.
[219:10.28]You have any fucking moves?
[219:36.12]Oh, I thought she just disappeared.

[220:10.88]Don't be dazed.
[220:18.25]I got a fucking force field now.
[220:24.11]This play is just so much better.
[220:25.95]This is just somebody that knows exactly how to play the fucking game.
[220:33.32]Dude, you're getting recycled.
[220:41.73]How do you grab?
[220:44.19]I keep getting grabbed.
[220:45.35]I think I got it.
[220:47.55]I'm going to do the G'day bait.
[220:49.23]Is it going to work every time?
[221:09.14]They're getting farmed.
[221:22.69]How does every character have 60 moves?
[221:24.43]Yeah, that's what I want to know too.
[221:25.45]I think they're physically talking about even just low punch and low kick and shit.
[221:52.23]I don't think it's possible to win.
[221:53.95]I don't think it's physically impossible to win.
[221:57.51]I can't do it.
[221:59.41]Spamming's not gonna help me.
[222:00.33]It's not gonna do anything.
[222:00.97]Stop!
[222:17.54]Round two, fight.
[222:47.99]Nobody wants to play with the person that's gonna beat win every time You got to give a little bit of give so you so I think that I'm doing okay Even if you're gonna win every single match, it's like man got you in that one.
[223:02.10]Yeah, you totally did Nice job, man.
[223:06.96]I didn't see that coming.
[223:07.98]I didn't see that throw coming Hey, you still you want to play tomorrow, right?

[223:17.67]I got him locked in forever.
[223:21.13]Look at the instructions, LOL.
[223:22.37]Yeah, I just read the manual.

[224:05.30]I wanna see these characters.
[224:06.18]I'm not still gonna lose.
[224:08.32]If I lose this next match, I'll get 50 subs.
[224:44.24]I'm the best character in the game.
[224:45.46]He has the Honda punch.
[225:04.08]Yeah, I'm not going to have to give 50 subs.
[225:05.51]It's not going to happen.
[225:15.77]This is cheesy.
[225:16.73]It's not cheesy.
[225:19.86]The developers have it in the game, so I'm going to use it.
[225:28.20]Oh.
[225:34.48]Dude, you're kind of like being an asshole with that kind of like exploity kind of move.
[225:37.94]Well, if the devs didn't want to play the game, they wouldn't have programmed it in.
[225:42.18]I win.
[225:57.63]No subs.
[226:00.85]I win.
[226:01.49]No subs.
[226:14.42]scamming oh I gotta this is a really important question for you guys so I have I didn't even know they were making this I bought it because I wanted to play it on stream eventually but uh kingdoms of alamore the re-reckoning they re-kind of did the game I bought it for Xbox 360.
[226:44.25]Is the Xbox 360 version better than the remake?
[226:49.87]Should I play it on the original version?
[226:51.37]Or should I play the new one?
[226:55.18]It's shit, but it's fun shit.
[226:59.58]Kingdoms of Alanmore.
[227:00.56]What?
[227:01.22]I don't play either.
[227:03.16]It's a shitty remaster.
[227:06.34]It's not a remake.
[227:07.06]The game's boring.
[227:09.31]Don't even play it.
[227:10.37]Oh, well.
[227:11.11]It's a bad game.
[227:11.97]What do you mean bad game?
[227:15.94]New one looks nicer.
[227:16.84]Alright, we'll see.
[227:19.13]Got some quality of life fixes.
[227:20.39]Alright.
[227:25.49]If I end up with less than 50% health at the end of this round here, then I will give 100 subs.
[227:45.65]Uh, crisis averted.
[227:47.03]We're good.
[227:48.95]He's too OP.
[227:50.29]I'm fine.
[227:50.93]I didn't make any bets this time.
[228:32.71]every anime fight ever get up 10 seconds alright if this goes to
[229:00.83]Yeah, I was looking at chat.
[229:02.31]I wasn't even paying attention to the game.
[229:04.31]I was looking at the chat room.
[229:10.09]I think my 3DO is overheating.
[229:11.35]Where's my character?
[229:14.80]What?
[229:16.20]Why am I green?
[229:17.54]What is happening?
[229:20.42]I think the 3DO is gonna break.
[229:22.22]This thing was 600 bucks.
[229:24.06]It better not be breaking.
[229:27.02]What do I do?
[229:33.23]It's gonna be fine.
[229:37.81]By the way, it's not even 600.
[229:38.61]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[229:41.51]It was way less than 600 bucks.
[229:43.83]I just want you to think that I spent way too much money on this.
[229:48.12]Quick, dunk it in water.
[229:52.66]Wait a minute.
[229:53.74]Okay.
[229:53.98]Okay.
[230:05.64]Put it in rice.
[230:06.60]Put the 3DO in a bag of rice.
[230:12.64]And then put it in the fridge.
[230:13.60]I learned a new move.
[230:38.67]Okay, this is, um... This is horrible fucking gameplay.
[230:52.46]I'm embarrassed for you, because you're watching me do this.
[230:56.14]You know what I mean?
[230:57.04]Like, I'm embarrassed for you guys, because you have to experience this.
[231:01.57]Dragon wind.
[231:04.57]Like, I'm embarrassed because you guys are embarrassed for me, so I'm embarrassed for you.
[231:13.88]This gameplay is so bad.
[231:15.38]That if somebody came in right now that has never seen me stream, and then watched this, they would have to assume that every single one of you was a fucking bot, that I was viewbotting.
[231:25.86]Because there's no way.
[231:28.42]Like, this guy's playing a fighting game, and he's just crouch-kicking, and like, not talking.
[231:36.38]He's just losing and shit.
[231:37.52]This guy's... They have to be viewbotting.
[231:42.66]They have to be.
[231:45.96]Why don't you guys just start saying... You know when somebody's just egregiously viewbotting?
[231:52.32]And all the comments are just like... Wow.
[231:55.47]Can't believe you just did that.
[231:57.65]Nice one.
[232:00.01]Loving the stream.
[232:03.99]Blowing my mind.
[232:14.99]Thanks guys.
[232:18.33]And then they'll say in the chat.
[232:19.67]They'll talk about something that doesn't even exist.
[232:21.39]Hey man.
[232:25.23]What setup are you using?
[232:26.27]I'm really starting to get into the idea of playing games on my PC.
[232:30.09]And I'm just curious what I should be using.
[232:31.63]Well I have a GTX 1080.
[232:33.07]And that's what I use.
[232:36.97]That's what I would say you should use too.
[232:38.33]What happened to me?
[232:50.10]No, don't use emotes.
[232:51.20]No emotes.
[232:51.76]Don't do that.
[232:52.96]Only say, wow, cool gameplay or something.
[232:57.42]Emotes, you're giving it away.
[233:10.44]I should accidentally alt tab and show like five viewbotting programs and go oh shit.
[233:33.87]And it's, and it's 56, there's 5,673 people there.
[233:37.43]I alt-tab and it's just 5,672 view bots.
[233:42.53]Because I'm watching my own stream.
[233:44.62]I have my own stream open.
[233:49.14]I got a power-up.
[233:51.22]I got a power-up.
[234:05.23]I'm done.
[234:06.53]I'm done.
[234:07.21]I'm done.
[234:09.47]I do want to see the secret characters, though.
[234:11.13]There's so many people left to fight.
[234:12.71]I don't want... No.
[234:13.53]This one's supposed to be good.
[234:16.05]There's still so many more.
[234:28.90]still a stack of like so many 3do games but we need a 3do break I think after this this is just Mortal Kombat uh and how the is that move fair explain to me how an entire screen filling move you can't dodge despair
[235:02.42]I want to do the uppercut into the acid like in Mortal Kombat.
[235:05.48]It's kind of just making me want to play Mortal Kombat.
[235:08.48]Is that me saying hey?
[235:14.73]Watch it in 10 seconds.
[235:31.49]Stop!
[235:31.85]Only I can do that.
[235:33.47]So what should we do next?
[235:45.12]What should we do after 3DO for 3DO cooldown?
[235:48.84]I could do Saw.
[235:49.56]I could go back to Saw.
[235:51.96]And do Saw 2.
[235:52.50]I could do Super Monkey Ball.
[235:55.47]I could do...
[235:59.69]Face painting.
[236:00.35]Um, I don't think I'm going to do that.
[236:03.68]Doom Eternal.
[236:04.58]I don't know.
[236:11.44]Monkey Ball?
[236:11.90]You want Monkey Ball next?
[236:12.84]Well, not today, but I mean like next stream.
[236:16.54]Monkey Ball next stream?
[236:17.42]Super Monkey Ball next stream?
[236:18.78]Go.
[236:19.11]Go.
[236:26.31]Super Monkey Ball next stream.
[236:27.49]Lock it in.
[236:28.72]There's one.
[236:42.13]That's abnormal baby games.
[236:44.59]Yeah, and then I'll go, you know, we'll do VR.
[236:46.49]I'm gonna give you a date for VR because there's so many VR games I need to compile.
[236:50.37]Let's do VR.
[236:56.12]Uh, how about... Let's do VR.
[236:58.06]The week of the 28th.
[236:58.80]And then we'll lead into FTK.
[236:59.50]So we'll do some VR stuff for that 28th, the week of the 29th, 30th.
[237:01.76]Lock it in.
[237:02.04]I want to get back into it.
[237:21.86]Been a long time.
[237:29.82]Half-Life Alyx?
[237:34.29]Yeah.
[237:35.63]We'll start with Half-Life Alyx.
[237:39.11]That's something, I mean, I've wanted to do for a long time, so... What about Dru-Crew?
[237:50.82]Drew Crew is, I think, not going to happen for a while.
[237:54.82]You got that one chance randomly a few weeks ago.
[237:58.01]Remember where I panicked because I didn't have anything to do and had nothing to play and I freaked out?
[238:02.55]And I was... Something happened.
[238:03.77]What happened?
[238:04.89]And I opened up one of the Nancy Drew games and then I immediately closed it and freaked out.
[238:09.74]When was that?
[238:18.20]Um.
[238:19.04]Okay.
[238:19.28]That was weird.
[238:22.13]It was Fall Guys?
[238:23.31]Oh, that's right, because the Fall Guys servers were off.
[238:25.41]Haven't done that move.
[238:41.76]I don't even like this game, but I'm still here.
[238:43.29]I like playing.
[238:44.17]I don't know.
[238:44.65]It's alright.
[238:47.89]Dragon wins.
[238:51.13]These songs are all the same song.
[238:54.41]Hey!
[239:01.16]I need to play Lisa the Painful.
[239:07.53]I'm not gonna play Lisa the Painful.
[239:21.51]Not on stream.
[239:26.01]Can you play SSX Tricky?
[239:38.42]I don't know.
[239:38.78]It's going to be a painful chat experience.
[239:43.02]What about Ratatouille?
[239:45.40]It's funny that you say that.
[239:47.82]I told you that over the next couple of weeks.
[239:51.02]I wasn't going to tell you when it was going to happen.
[239:53.60]But Ratatouille is going to happen.
[239:56.72]I'm not going to tell you when.
[240:03.81]It's going to happen when you least expect it.
[240:05.67]That wouldn't have been great if I had that ready to go right now and I switched right now.
[240:20.00]It's not going to replace FTK.
[240:21.94]Can you go off the edge?
[240:31.12]No, not any second.
[240:37.04]You wouldn't expect it during FTK.
[240:38.48]Yeah, neither would I because that would be a waste of resources and time.
[240:46.06]When is FTK?
[240:46.70]October 3rd.
[240:48.91]At 3 p.m.
[240:49.67]Pacific, October 3rd is the new date for FTK.
[240:56.96]The Gran Turismo 4.
[241:08.33]Is there any actual driving game that would be fun to stream?
[241:13.13]Would that be fun?
[241:15.74]Is that one of those scenarios where I would just be terrible at it and it would crash and I'd give up after five minutes?
[241:31.24]Ow.
[241:32.36]Showrunner?
[241:33.00]I actually looked into that.
[241:34.76]That's when we have to drive cargo over snow and mud and stuff, right?
[241:38.86]That might be fun.
[241:39.58]Maybe I'll play that soon.
[241:46.49]We should do an FTK command.
[241:52.43]Play Wipeout.
[241:56.45]We'll play the Ratatouille game on September 28th.
[242:03.79]What?
[242:05.72]Oh shit.
[242:07.04]I actually did promise it already.
[242:08.98]When you least expect it, right?
[242:10.46]Oh.
[242:17.12]Did he just say find something new?
[242:19.18]He's mad that I'm doing the same move.
[242:23.20]He's getting bored of the stream too, just like you guys are.
[242:30.55]On VR!
[242:38.39]I don't expect you to keep your promise.
[242:39.71]Yeah, I did all the other- I did every promise on July 30th.
[242:47.60]Alright, there are only two.
[242:48.80]I'm going to try as hard as I can to get through this.
[242:50.32]I want to beat the game.
[242:51.85]I'm ready.
[242:59.35]I'm going to just absolutely steamroll the other two competitors.
[243:02.91]Let's go.
[243:08.41]Do VR and Ratatouille?
[243:11.41]This whole room has to be set up for VR.
[243:13.33]It has to stay that way for a little while.
[243:16.47]I like to stand up and do VR.
[243:17.59]I don't really like the seated VR.
[243:18.89]That makes me want to puke.
[243:21.70]So, standing VR, I have to kind of move stuff in the room and get it ready, so it has to stay like that for a little while.
[243:33.82]Beat Saber?
[243:34.30]I played Beat Saber already.
[243:35.24]It was good.
[243:35.56]I had a lot of fun.
[243:37.90]I don't know if I would play it again, but I played a lot of it during the last VR stream.
[243:44.93]Skull Man.
[243:52.09]Come on.
[243:55.92]I'm not gonna find something new.
[243:58.18]This works.
[244:02.22]I'm not ready to order anything else off the menu yet.
[244:04.22]I know what I like.
[244:15.02]Hag me when Jerma lies.
[244:19.83]Uh, one time I shoved a brick of cheese up my nose.
[244:35.17]True, true.
[244:36.51]Okay, how about this?
[244:37.25]I'm gonna stream for another 12 hours today.
[244:39.39]Is this the last boss?
[244:42.73]Is this the boss?
[244:50.88]I'm not gonna.
[244:51.94]I'm not gonna.
[244:52.84]That's not true.
[244:54.53]Tag him.
[244:55.47]Platforms.
[244:55.99]Yeah, this is kind of cool.
[245:21.91]cheesed your way to victory.
[245:23.75]Yes.
[245:25.43]It's still a victory.
[245:30.55]He's so pissed.
[245:39.30]He doesn't want to give me the medal at the end of the game.
[245:45.32]God damn it.
[245:46.38]Do something different.
[245:47.76]I've never had to get a good asshole like you with a trophy.
[245:56.60]So now what?
[245:57.00]I won.
[245:59.99]You don't deserve it.
[246:00.75]Let's get to the end.
[246:11.23]Oh, I got... I got Contra'd.
[246:15.32]Yeah, I got to the level 3 in Contra on easy and the game said, please, please play again.
[246:21.06]This time on the normal difficulty.
[246:23.86]Well...
[246:33.46]Yeah, that's okay.
[246:35.40]Alright, alright.
[246:36.92]I'm gonna call it here.
[246:39.02]We're gonna come back with Super Monkey Ball.
[246:44.16]Monkey Ball now?
[246:45.10]I can't do Monkey Ball now.
[246:50.10]I have discs surrounding me.
[246:52.05]I have to clean this shit up.
[246:53.15]Today was Psychic Detective Day and I loved every second of it.
[247:02.37]There's a bunch more 3DO stuff, but I think we need to cool down.
[247:07.35]It's too much.
[247:07.95]Too much weird shit in a row.
[247:10.73]So I will see you guys on Monday.
[247:12.13]I'll see you Monday.
[247:13.15]Or Super Monkey Ball.
[247:28.88]Gritty goes on fire.
[247:29.76]Yeah, it's freaking me out.
[247:30.86]Things are heating up and glitching and shit.
[247:32.58]See you guys for Super Monkey Ball.
[247:34.20]Thanks for watching as always.
[247:35.65]Just watch the Psychic Detective endings on YouTube.
[247:46.51]Maybe I will in the bath later.
[247:47.85]Alright, I have to turn this guy off.
[247:49.37]This guy's gotta go.
[247:50.61]Do a bath stream?
[247:52.19]Okay, if I had clothes on, could I do a bath stream?
[248:16.86]Would that be okay?
[248:19.94]Yes.
[248:20.98]Would it?
[248:21.68]Alright, well, let me think about that.
[248:25.80]I'll think about that.
[248:28.02]Uh, let's go say hello to Vinny.
[248:29.06]I think 7 Days to Die.
[248:34.98]But, not yet.
[248:40.55]Not yet.
[248:40.83]Because we have credits to do.
[248:43.58]Who's that guy?
[248:44.50]I want to be that character.
[248:45.28]That was like Skeletor from uh... Krang.
[248:49.44]What?
[248:50.02]Krang?
[248:50.40]What's the game called?
[248:52.52]What the fuck is the name of the game?
[248:53.82]The game with the guy with the skeleton with the sword and the shield.
[248:55.82]What is it?
[248:56.92]Uh... What is it called?
[249:01.36]Kill... uh... Killer Instinct.
[249:09.08]Not the brain that sits inside of the guy in Ninja Turtles, no.
[249:14.39]Alright, here come the credits.
[249:16.07]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[249:19.83]Ooh, this is different.
[249:26.32]Ooh.
[249:27.78]This is cool.
[249:34.31]That's pretty sick, actually.
[249:36.09]Nice job.
[249:43.21]Thank God the music ended.
[249:44.49]Now it's readable.
[249:46.29]It's actually readable.
[249:49.54]Thanks to the subs, everybody.
[249:50.84]I appreciate it.
[249:53.08]It's like your names are being etched into the book.
[250:00.42]How long does it take?
[250:01.16]I mean, we're at age.
[250:02.00]I can't be that much longer.
[250:03.24]I mean, there's a lot of subs.
[250:09.24]There's always a lot of subs.
[250:10.47]It always takes a long time.
[250:14.65]There's always tons of fucking subs.
[250:18.55]Happy birthday.
[250:20.11]Am I going to stream on my birthday?
[250:22.55]Oh, shit.
[250:24.31]We might have to have a birthday stream on Monday.
[250:29.90]It might be a happy birthday stream on Monday.
[250:36.36]That's very possible.
[250:40.36]Bake myself a birthday cake.
[250:44.43]There needs to be music, doesn't there?
[250:48.67]Oh, the music's not even hooked up here.
[250:52.78]How old are you?
[250:54.12]74th birthday?
[250:54.64]No.
[250:55.90]You guys can take a guess at how old I am.
[250:59.57]Wish my dad a happy birthday.
[251:00.71]Hey, Tasty Turd.
[251:02.55]You might not know that that's your son's screen name.
[251:05.39]And you might have just heard that and you've got to wait.
[251:06.90]It's my birthday.
[251:08.30]And my son's screen name is Tasty Turd.
[251:09.84]But I'm sorry to be the one to bring that up first.
[251:13.32]But your son says happy birthday, dad.
[251:19.36]Thank you, Tasty Turd.
[251:24.35]Well, I will see you guys on Monday.
[251:28.92]Have a great rest of your night.
[251:29.58]We're going to raid Vinny.
[251:30.78]Go say hello.
[251:33.96]Take care of yourselves.
[251:36.54]And good night.
[251:43.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[251:44.34]Wait a second.
[251:44.88]Wait a second.
[251:45.26]Wait a second.
[251:46.68]I'm going to give $100 earlier.
[251:48.65]I want to make sure I catch this.
[251:49.87]I just caught it right here.
[251:50.61]10,000 bits.
[251:55.05]Seven years is a long time.
[251:57.91]I'm surprised that some of you guys have been around for that long and you still think this is interesting.
[252:23.20]I think we've said this before, but even after like watching seven or eight seasons straight years of a TV show, you kind of start to go, eh, I'm kind of over it.
[252:34.05]So, I'm just happy that a lot of you guys are still around.
[252:37.47]I'm glad that you are.
[252:39.08]He didn't say it was interesting.
[252:48.57]Alright, guys.
[252:49.79]I'll see you later.
[252:50.53]See you Monday.
[252:51.01]Let's go raid Vinesauce.
[252:54.04]See you later.
[253:20.09]Thank you.
[253:54.98]Thank you.
