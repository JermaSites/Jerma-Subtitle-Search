[ve:60.16.100]

[00:13.86]From the creator of Sam and Cat and Henry Danger comes a brand new show.
[00:18.48]Not that.
[00:20.52]Not an advertisement in my ears.
[00:31.45]Shh.
[00:32.37]Shh.
[00:32.61]This isn't real.
[00:35.29]You can tell it's not real because I'm playing Diablo 3.
[00:40.26]On my... On my barbarian...
[00:45.45]Yeah, I'm just kind of doing a bandwidth test.
[00:51.77]You know how it is.
[01:00.70]Anyways, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good night, Truman Show, you know.
[01:19.39]Why can I not see my stream?
[01:21.13]I need to see how it sounds.
[01:22.79]I need to see how it looks.
[01:23.75]I need to see all these things.
[01:35.49]Is anything happening today?
[01:36.63]I need to make sure that no one's going to come knock on my door and be like, yeah, we need to do a bunch of stuff.
[01:44.65]I don't think so.
[01:55.72]Yeah, the frame rate is bad because I'm currently not in the game.
[01:59.84]I'm all tabbed.
[02:00.74]It drops the frame rate crazy when you're not in the game.
[02:03.92]I just need to somehow reload this.
[02:14.21]Pop out the chat.
[02:19.63]Hmm.
[02:20.75]I don't even have one of those fancy intro card things that go here.
[02:25.92]You know, right now, you should be hearing, like, the cool music in the background with the thing that says, like, oh, starting soon with the countdown.
[02:34.48]I don't have that shit.
[02:42.07]I don't even know if I'm ever going to have that, by the way.
[02:45.65]This is going to be the shittiest stream you would potentially be following.
[03:00.99]Okay, well, I'm just going to do this because screw it.
[03:07.06]Why not?
[03:09.94]Yeah, bear with me here, guys.
[03:11.20]I'm sorry about this.
[03:12.38]I'm so sorry about this.
[03:17.64]Okay, well, I'm just going to do this because screw it.
[03:23.66]Why not?
[03:26.54]Yeah, bear with me here, guys.
[03:27.80]I'm sorry about this.
[03:28.98]I'm so sorry about this.
[03:34.23]Okay, well.
[03:36.79]I'm just going to do this.
[03:37.59]So the reason why I'm doing this stream right now.
[03:39.71]Screw it, why not?
[03:40.71]Oh boy, I'm going to hear myself.
[03:44.21]So the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to test my bandwidth.
[03:48.88]Because obviously I've moved and I need to make sure I can handle streaming.
[03:59.02]So.
[03:59.16]And there's not a really good reliable way to test that unless you actually turn it on.
[04:07.75]Seems like it's okay for now.
[04:09.85]Let me see what it looks like when I do this.
[04:29.44]Hmm.
[04:30.72]Maybe I can increase the bandwidth a little bit.
[04:35.87]How does it look?
[04:38.55]Not good.
[04:39.37]Good.
[04:41.61]I'll try it.
[04:48.59]I'm Jeremiah95 and I never re-chat.
[04:51.91]What?
[04:52.11]I'm trying to get ready.
[04:55.99]Well, I'm going to try this for a little while.
[05:03.70]And if I don't see in the chat, like, oh, God, this is the worst stream I've ever watched, then maybe I'll turn it up a little bit to, like, be like 2,500 to 2,200 maybe.
[05:18.71]Alright, well, whatever.
[05:19.65]This is Diablo 3.
[05:20.63]This is obviously Diablo 3.
[05:22.11]I'm playing on my Season's character because they just did that big patch.
[05:26.97]So, we're going to go do a bounty.
[05:28.91]We're just going to mess around and play and talk about things.
[05:35.92]So, we're going to go to Demon Prison.
[05:44.96]So here's the real test.
[05:46.78]Am I going to bottom out here when I start to hit things with a sword?
[05:50.82]We'll find out, right?
[05:51.68]It'd be funny if the first guy I swing at my computer crashes.
[05:57.56]I hope that doesn't happen.
[06:00.55]Oh god, this is the worst stream.
[06:02.03]Where are the monsters?
[06:03.35]This is a very monster-less Diablo 3 right now.
[06:08.23]Alright, let me remember how to play this video game.
[06:24.06]Where are the enemies?
[06:28.38]Blizzard, what happened to the monsters part of this game?
[06:36.27]Okay.
[06:39.95]Let's go.
[06:43.45]Let's go down this way.
[06:44.75]Thank you for telling me where to go because I had no idea what was going on.
[06:55.28]What would I name my baby?
[06:58.38]That's a good question.
[07:00.64]That's a question that's going to take me months or years to answer.
[07:05.31]I can't just really answer that.
[07:06.47]What am I going to be like?
[07:07.23]Oh yeah, David.
[07:07.97]I don't know.
[07:15.65]So I'm two-handed or swing at you, Barbarian Man.
[07:18.87]And I don't even know if I can handle this.
[07:20.09]This is Torment 1.
[07:20.85]I just got this guy to 70.
[07:24.19]Very recently.
[07:25.91]So I have no idea if he can even handle this difficulty or not.
[07:28.11]But we'll find out.
[07:28.77]I don't even have my buff activated.
[07:35.95]What a bad Diablo 3 player I am.
[07:45.37]Don't forget about this guy.
[07:46.25]He'll never kill him.
[07:47.97]Actually, it's like right here, isn't it?
[07:51.43]Why do I feel so slow?
[07:55.97]Yeah, no computer crash so far.
[07:57.89]That's good.
[08:00.69]You know what?
[08:01.05]We're going Super Saiyan.
[08:06.63]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[08:08.07]Where are they?
[08:08.40]Over here?
[08:08.64]Are these guys over here?
[08:12.10]So, Diablo 3, you're probably wondering, why are you playing this right now?
[08:15.98]I'm not, like, back into Diablo 3.
[08:18.78]Or do I really care that much about D3 at the moment?
[08:22.18]It's just, what are these guys, Orbiter Shield?
[08:24.18]This is going to be annoying.
[08:25.00]This is why I didn't want to play on Torment 1, because I'm never going to kill anything.
[08:31.88]Just a new patch came out, and they did the Kanai's Cube, or Kanai's Cube, whatever the hell you want to call it.
[08:38.88]So, I was interested.
[08:42.53]Do I drop it down or do I stay on this?
[08:44.07]What do you guys think?
[08:45.87]These guys are taking a very long time to kill.
[08:56.22]Oh, a Biaz.
[08:59.88]I wish I could just scream out loud.
[09:03.90]Speaking of Biaz, this thing.
[09:07.55]You know what?
[09:07.85]Maybe I will.
[09:08.59]Maybe I will, because this is like a secret, super secret stream, you know what I mean?
[09:12.09]No, there's not a bunch of you guys here.
[09:13.39]Maybe we can talk about this, because I can't.
[09:15.73]I can't, though.
[09:16.29]That would ruin everything.
[09:17.11]What am I thinking?
[09:26.28]Die already.
[09:27.16]Oh my god.
[09:29.18]Where's my legendary?
[09:30.02]Where's my ten legendaries?
[09:33.64]What the hell?
[09:34.06]What do I do?
[09:34.58]Do I gotta fight this guy?
[09:37.49]Who cares?
[09:39.31]Get on with it.
[09:40.93]Shadow the Crystal Prison.
[09:43.51]Okay.
[09:44.09]Thank you.
[09:44.93]Time to go back to town.
[09:46.83]Whoa, wait a minute.
[09:47.57]It's not that easy.
[09:48.47]Oh, these guys are going to be chump.
[09:51.85]Oh, watch this.
[09:52.23]Ready?
[09:52.39]Here we go.
[09:57.48]I love, like, Barbarian.
[09:59.22]You can just hold right-click and win the game.
[10:03.53]It's a whirlwind, because they made two-handers not the worst items in the game anymore.
[10:07.51]I like when they really bunch up like this and pull them together.
[10:15.00]I probably should show you guys the runes and stuff, right?
[10:19.94]People are interested in that type of thing, aren't they?
[10:23.42]Jerma, you didn't even show us what runes you're using.
[10:25.60]How can I tell if you're even good at this game?
[10:27.30]Well, I'm not, so don't worry.
[10:32.70]Okay, another wave.
[10:33.96]Come on, get them all.
[10:35.00]Squad all of you.
[10:36.48]I want to get every single person here.
[10:39.84]Did that not hit anyone with revenge?
[10:41.18]That's revenge, right?
[10:42.50]Yeah, this is like a chump character.
[10:52.74]I have like a character that's decked out, but I'm not sure how good that character is anymore because of the last few patches I haven't played in a while.
[11:02.74]New Paragon.
[11:03.44]I don't even know how to build this.
[11:05.82]Hit damage always, every time.
[11:08.32]And life.
[11:09.60]Alright, let me like actually pop the chat out so I can respond to things.
[11:18.53]Is it already popped out somewhere?
[11:20.79]It is.
[11:22.05]Thank goodness.
[11:23.15]Okay.
[11:26.41]There we go.
[11:28.21]Now I can see all your beautiful faces.
[11:38.12]I can just leave.
[11:38.96]I don't even know why I'm still here.
[11:48.79]The reason why I'm doing bounties is because that's where you get the new resource to be able to use the 10 eyes cube.
[11:56.33]What's left here?
[11:58.97]Oh, thank God it's not kill Malthael.
[12:00.79]I never would have been able to do that by myself.
[12:03.89]Oh, that's... I don't know.
[12:04.53]I don't think I'm going to be able to kill Adria.
[12:08.09]Let's find out right now.
[12:11.28]Stop playing Beyblade.
[12:13.44]This is Diablo 3.
[12:23.40]Oh, that's why.
[12:25.54]Beyblade.
[12:26.26]You just turned into like a... That's funny.
[12:30.42]Hey, one enemy.
[12:35.28]You're watching me stream in school?
[12:37.70]Get back to work.
[12:40.26]Pay attention to your math teacher.
[12:42.38]I'm telling you, you're going to use that Algebra 1 Part 2 someday.
[12:48.17]Just kidding.
[12:48.69]No, you aren't ever.
[12:51.53]But still, pay attention.
[12:53.19]It'll get your brain working.
[12:56.09]This is not good for your brain.
[12:57.09]What I'm doing right now is like... Oh, I'm going to die.
[12:58.79]That was close.
[13:04.92]That was close.
[13:06.20]Probably shouldn't be standing in the fire, but I have revenge, so I'm okay.
[13:11.12]I'll be okay, I guess.
[13:16.04]I forgot to show my runes again.
[13:17.40]I'm such a bad streamer.
[13:19.40]See, that's something, guys.
[13:21.10]This is very new to me.
[13:24.14]I'm not good at streaming.
[13:28.86]Look at this.
[13:29.54]Look at me.
[13:35.04]This isn't too bad.
[13:41.24]Watch out for the meteor strike.
[13:45.59]Alright.
[13:47.01]My bags are already full.
[13:48.57]Oh, they must have been full from the last time I played this.
[13:52.47]You skipped class today?
[13:54.65]Naughty.
[13:55.71]Naughty, naughty, naughty.
[13:59.31]Stay in school, man.
[14:01.69]At least just, like, you just gotta get through it, right?
[14:05.93]I was never a good student.
[14:07.23]I was a pretty bad student, actually.
[14:10.61]I just barely got into college.
[14:13.77]I was one of those students that... I was like a C student.
[14:18.43]That's not something to brag about.
[14:20.63]But I did enough so I would learn and be able to get by.
[14:25.09]And not do the best on every exam.
[14:28.55]But that's not the greatest idea.
[14:31.11]Because then it took me like... It was a pain in the ass to get into school.
[14:38.14]Where is Maltheim?
[14:39.22]Am I in the right place?
[14:42.17]How the fuck did I end up here?
[14:45.03]What the fuck happened?
[14:46.05]What?
[14:46.37]Did I click that?
[14:47.59]No, I didn't.
[14:50.52]I did, didn't I?
[14:52.20]How did that happen?
[14:55.84]Yeah, I just walked up and did it.
[14:57.90]That was...
[15:03.48]No, you want a real tip.
[15:05.06]You want a real, like, strategy.
[15:06.18]Like, life strategy.
[15:09.04]Just get... Do... Get good at what you like.
[15:14.16]And be passionate about something.
[15:17.04]Now, that might be like algebra.
[15:18.59]You might be like a mathematician, and guess what?
[15:20.49]If you're really good at that type of thing, you'll go on to be like a programmer.
[15:24.09]That's fucking awesome.
[15:27.15]But just focus on what you like and what you're good at.
[15:30.51]then your life will be immensely better.
[15:42.41]So here's the great test.
[15:43.37]Oh, this is good.
[15:44.22]Now I won't feel so slow.
[15:47.68]But Jerma, what if I hate everything?
[15:50.49]That's not true.
[15:51.96]That's not true.
[15:52.74]You like something.
[15:54.62]You enjoy something.
[15:56.96]Right?
[15:59.12]You can't hate everything.
[16:09.45]Yeah, when did everybody go back to school?
[16:10.75]Did you guys go all back to school...
[16:14.58]last week or when was the actual start?
[16:17.02]I know a lot of people around here had to go back because of all the horrible snow that like everybody in this area has gotten this past winter.
[16:29.13]So it was like all this like school snow days and everything.
[16:34.30]August 10th.
[16:35.20]Yikes.
[16:36.48]August 10th.
[16:38.74]When did you get out?
[16:49.27]Is Scare Saturdays ever coming back?
[16:50.73]No, absolutely not.
[16:53.73]The only way Scare Saturdays will come back is if some rich billionaire pays me a million dollars to do it.
[17:01.41]Then I'll do another one.
[17:03.73]So if you're like a super rich billionaire and you want Scare Saturdays back, write a check for a million dollars and I'll consider it.
[17:11.94]But no, that type of content, I'm not really keen on doing it anymore.
[17:23.04]I'm actually not doing too terrible in Torment 1, being like a fresh 70.
[17:29.93]Although I would like to kill things much faster than this.
[17:35.69]It was legit the best thing you did, but was it though?
[17:39.71]I mean, like real talk, everybody does that.
[17:45.43]That's like, you can throw a stone and you'll find a YouTuber that plays scary games.
[17:51.77]Was it really that different and that more interesting than what anybody else was doing?
[17:56.53]Probably not.
[18:02.16]Paragon.
[18:07.32]Yes, I am going to play more GTA.
[18:08.56]Actually, I want to record GTA again because of the recently announced free mode update they're doing on the 15th.
[18:21.28]They're adding, they're adding like a chase the monster mode, which that's hilarious.
[18:25.29]That might be fun to like record with some people.
[18:28.99]The thing where you have to keep the cars inside the bubble, that looks really fun.
[18:37.34]Some of those videos, like, I really enjoyed making a lot of those videos.
[18:43.60]But some of them were just awful, right?
[18:46.64]Like some of those scare Saturday's videos were fucking terrible.
[18:52.38]There was a moment where I was playing on an island and there was a Lumberjack with no head chasing me.
[18:56.06]That was fucking terrible.
[19:00.90]I'm like embarrassed that that video exists.
[19:05.95]It is what it is though.
[19:10.57]Stream Dark Souls?
[19:11.43]No way.
[19:13.23]I wouldn't be able to do anything in that game.
[19:18.34]I have a hard time talking and playing and paying attention and chatting stuff with people when I'm playing a game.
[19:25.40]So playing a game like Dark Souls would be the absolute worst decision of my entire life.
[19:30.96]I probably wouldn't get past the tutorial.
[19:36.05]Just dance around through these guys.
[19:44.21]What was the name of that game?
[19:45.07]Do you remember the name of that game?
[20:04.09]Blood-borne how Dark Souls 3 is coming out soon if that's in the same realm.
[20:10.79]Oh Sorry, excuse me.
[20:13.51]I'm like burping and talking what a gross person If Dark Souls 3 is on the same playing field as blood-borne was Then maybe I could handle that because I could handle blood-borne.
[20:28.29]Oh
[20:34.09]Alright, we're just gonna whack this guy.
[20:44.42]I need to... I need to go back to town.
[20:47.70]I gotta just craft down all this stuff.
[20:49.34]I can't pick up anything.
[20:54.44]Okay, the stalker... Yeah, stalker was one... That is a great... That was a great video.
[21:02.10]I loved everything about that video.
[21:06.32]Burger Boy just sitting in the back drinking.
[21:09.50]Just like... At everything.
[21:12.34]Where's he?
[21:12.66]Up here.
[21:15.14]Literally after everything.
[21:18.42]Burger Boy would just start laughing that laugh.
[21:21.82]Do I even need this?
[21:27.73]No.
[21:28.65]Both these items suck.
[21:29.61]I'll just wait until I get a good one.
[21:30.65]I don't care.
[21:34.20]I think that's good.
[21:35.04]Maybe I'll hold on to this.
[21:35.78]In case I get a good shield.
[21:38.20]A good offhand or something.
[21:41.00]Yeah, I'll hold on to that.
[21:54.59]I'm just looking for any items that I have that are not 70.
[21:56.89]I think I have at least a couple.
[22:00.53]Oh, those are... Actually, no.
[22:04.42]Oh, legendary would probably always be better than those.
[22:06.60]70.
[22:06.62]70.
[22:06.64]70.
[22:06.66]70.
[22:06.68]70.
[22:06.70]70.
[22:08.62]Yeah.
[22:08.94]That's alright.
[22:10.22]Okay, back to work.
[22:15.36]Back to work.
[22:36.75]I can pick up all this stuff.
[22:43.66]If I ever keep streaming, and it becomes a thing to stream, maybe I'll get emotes.
[22:55.96]Can you have a middle finger as an emote?
[22:59.39]Probably not now.
[23:00.27]I don't think so.
[23:11.44]70... 70... What's the point of Diablo?
[23:15.52]Good question.
[23:17.04]That is the question of the afternoon.
[23:19.10]You know what the point of Diablo is?
[23:22.03]This.
[23:26.97]Okay, got the item.
[23:28.77]Okay, this again.
[23:32.85]What'd he drop?
[23:36.17]Does it have orange text?
[23:39.49]It does.
[23:41.07]Identify.
[23:41.57]Oh, this is plus 2% more than my current axe.
[23:47.49]Do this again.
[23:48.07]That's it.
[23:56.35]Hey, let's go get Adria.
[24:00.92]Alright.
[24:02.12]Place your bets.
[24:03.22]I'm probably gonna lose.
[24:15.21]Oh boy.
[24:17.15]This is gonna take forever.
[24:28.51]I think I'm going to lower the difficulty just so I can kill this boss in less than two hours.
[24:32.55]I mean, she's not going to kill me.
[24:38.24]But I'm going to hit her in rage timer.
[24:41.18]Lower difficulty.
[24:42.58]She'll just enrage and I'll die, right?
[24:47.85]I knew this was going to happen.
[24:52.79]Even on master, this is going to take a long time.
[25:06.57]Don't stand in the fire.
[25:07.53]It doesn't really... I mean, she's not going to kill me.
[25:10.97]She's going to do this thing now where she drinks up all the blood and she goes... And the slugs come down.
[25:17.33]Don't touch the slugs or you'll get blood on you and it's gross.
[25:27.95]Man.
[25:30.01]Do I have to drop the difficulty again just to kill her?
[25:34.50]Probably.
[25:34.76]Probably.
[25:38.19]I think I'm going to die here, because I'm probably going to hit it in Rage Tire.
[25:54.15]Not even at 50%.
[26:11.85]Yep.
[26:12.97]We're doing it.
[26:14.17]We're down on expert.
[26:16.75]See, Diablo 3 still makes you feel like you're good at stuff because it calls the difficulties cool.
[26:20.90]Like, oh, look, don't worry.
[26:22.38]You're on expert.
[26:24.62]You have to be an expert at this game to understand how to play right here.
[26:30.70]And below this?
[26:32.06]Hard.
[26:33.39]It's hard.
[26:33.73]It's hard.
[26:37.14]The easiest difficulty in this whole game is called normal.
[26:41.12]And I don't think it's possible to die in normal.
[26:54.20]Okay, here we go.
[26:55.34]Did I hit it?
[26:56.22]Is she enraging?
[26:57.06]Uh-oh, she said a line.
[27:02.90]She said a voice line.
[27:03.72]That means I'm going to enrage.
[27:11.32]Alright, at least I got my thing back.
[27:12.72]I can just do this now.
[27:13.52]Hopefully she'll... Yeah, that's just a killer thing.
[27:24.28]Come on.
[27:24.94]I hope this is the only boss here.
[27:34.51]The note.
[27:35.63]Leave your note on the ground.
[27:37.71]Now I lost my torment only legendaries because I had to do this.
[27:41.57]Whoops-a-daisy.
[27:42.49]Whatever.
[27:42.81]At least now this will go much faster.
[27:52.71]You want pizza right now?
[27:56.03]Go make one.
[27:58.34]Go to the supermarket.
[27:59.28]Go get a Dr. Roker's pizza.
[28:03.16]They're very good.
[28:06.12]Those of you that were around when Star was streaming the other day.
[28:08.66]Talking about Dr. Oker's pizza.
[28:12.92]Perilous Cave, level 2.
[28:14.12]I hate these bounties.
[28:16.78]You gotta go find this cave, get to level 2, and then kill everything in level 2.
[28:21.03]I'm lagging now.
[28:24.53]Just waiting for the Mercy map pack to show me where to go.
[28:34.54]That's the thing, when I start streaming more often, I really, oh, oh, oh, I thought that was a treasure goblin.
[28:42.46]That's not a treasure goblin.
[28:44.08]That's like a little guy with a shovel.
[28:51.23]That's not it.
[28:54.35]Hey, look, I got the map pack.
[28:56.71]It's down here.
[29:12.25]I really need more.
[29:12.99]I don't know what I need more of.
[29:19.02]Oh, forget you guys.
[29:19.78]I'm going this way.
[29:30.18]Glad to see you're streaming Mighty Quest.
[29:32.59]Does that game still exist?
[29:40.52]Does that game still exist?
[29:41.76]Does the mighty quest for epic loot still exist?
[29:47.40]It can't, right?
[29:48.54]It can't.
[29:59.45]None of these monsters matter.
[30:00.41]We're just trying to get to level 2.
[30:02.41]Although there are chests.
[30:04.67]Now I have to get rid of these things.
[30:09.51]resplendent chest.
[30:16.02]Get out of the way.
[30:25.99]Wait, TF2 updated today?
[30:35.07]What did they do?
[30:44.02]Get away from me, you little maggots.
[30:48.98]Oh.
[30:50.04]Crawl up somebody else's ass.
[30:51.36]Get out of here.
[30:52.66]I'm just trying to skip to the next... I'm, like, stunned.
[30:56.16]Alright, you know what?
[30:56.70]That's it.
[30:58.80]Now you made me angry.
[31:01.48]Now you made me angry.
[31:02.22]Now you made me spin around in a circle.
[31:03.56]You made me angry.
[31:16.18]When is Rat Movie 3 coming?
[31:17.50]Christmas.
[31:25.75]Christmas.
[31:30.19]I think.
[31:36.78]Okay, we're in level 2.
[31:37.58]That means everything in here has to go...
[31:48.48]Is it all maggots in here?
[32:00.81]Maybe.
[32:01.49]When's the next wrestling video?
[32:04.23]Christmas.
[32:04.51]I'm going to say Christmas for everything.
[32:15.46]These guys are being affected by a champion.
[32:17.30]Where is he?
[32:19.99]No, they're not.
[32:21.14]Okay, this is just telling me that you have to kill these.
[32:23.24]There's only a certain amount left.
[32:24.19]I thought that was an aura from someone.
[32:39.75]Oh, you know what?
[32:40.17]Maybe I will do like Rat Movie 3.
[32:41.99]The Christmas special on Halloween.
[32:45.86]That'll be like my Halloween video.
[32:47.78]The rats are like too stupid.
[32:48.82]They don't understand it's not Christmas.
[32:51.52]It'll be a whole Christmas special.
[32:54.36]With like Christmas music.
[33:04.05]Okay, that's done.
[33:04.81]Let's go up here.
[33:20.92]But the one thing I will tell you, this is the one thing I will say about the next wrestling video.
[33:27.73]I will never, never be able to top it.
[33:34.40]Ever.
[33:37.24]This next wrestling video that you will see, I will never top it.
[33:43.86]Ever.
[33:46.96]And I'm kind of concerned about it, if I can very plainly say.
[34:00.01]We'll see, though.
[34:06.23]We'll see.
[34:12.61]That is a pretty big call.
[34:14.39]That's a pretty big statement.
[34:15.36]I know.
[34:17.22]But, see, I know something you don't know.
[34:19.06]Right?
[34:32.51]150.
[34:32.71]These guys are not going to make up.
[34:35.53]I need to kill 150 things.
[34:42.83]and Barask the Tunneler.
[34:46.07]Wherever he may be.
[34:47.53]Up that way.
[35:02.14]I'm the only one that knows the truth.
[35:05.90]Oh, Otto.
[35:07.90]He's sleeping right behind me.
[35:08.68]What are you doing, dog?
[35:17.93]I always forget to put that buff on.
[35:19.77]It's very necessary.
[35:36.21]Teleport?
[35:36.65]Are you serious, man?
[35:37.63]Probably just do a Rift after this.
[35:43.94]That would make the most sense, right?
[35:55.67]Come on.
[35:56.19]No, don't stand in that.
[35:58.11]Don't hit me with your rocks.
[35:59.43]I didn't hit the other guys.
[36:04.02]What?
[36:08.88]Give me a new weapon.
[36:09.60]I need a new big-ass weapon.
[36:12.90]You know what I mean?
[36:13.38]I mean, this is a big weapon, but it's not a big-ass weapon.
[36:23.39]Hmm...
[36:27.69]Come here, you.
[36:30.53]Come here, you.
[36:42.67]So, now that it's been, I don't know, like 20 minutes or so, 15 minutes, does it seem stable?
[36:51.67]Or has it been a couple of opportunities where you've been like, this kind of sucks, to be honest.
[36:58.68]Like, stream quality-wise.
[37:00.00]Like... Yeah, it's been... Oh, it's been... Oh, it's been good.
[37:03.05]Charm, it's been good.
[37:03.75]But you're, like, tilting your head a little bit.
[37:05.55]Like, the... You're doing the... It sucked, but I don't want to tell you it sucked.
[37:09.67]It was good.
[37:10.25]It was good, man.
[37:10.95]It was good.
[37:11.35]How many more do I got to...
[37:28.56]stable it's stable okay then that means I can probably turn it up a little the next time I do this Twitch allows up to 3500 right
[37:59.21]Mike could be a little louder.
[38:00.09]Okay.
[38:03.78]Okay.
[38:08.62]Give me just one second.
[38:11.72]Your camera's not working?
[38:13.64]That's working as intended.
[38:20.05]Did I leave anything on the ground here?
[38:22.71]One more.
[38:23.57]One more.
[38:24.89]Rathma.
[38:32.45]What are you talking about?
[38:33.05]This is hard.
[38:34.63]Have you seen how many times I spun around in a circle?
[38:37.43]You do this.
[38:38.41]You do this this many times and you tell me if you can still stand.
[38:41.10]You know how hard that is to do?
[38:45.90]You know how big this guy is?
[38:48.78]He's even bigger.
[38:52.46]This one's going to be annoying.
[39:02.30]Why can I... I'm supposed to destroy this, right?
[39:08.64]Oh, there's one more guy down here.
[39:11.45]He just shot an arrow at me and he died.
[39:13.13]Okay, cool.
[39:18.86]See, that's the beauty of this.
[39:20.06]My finger's not cramping right now because I don't have to do anything.
[39:23.66]I'm not like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[39:26.22]I don't know.
[39:26.64]I'm just holding right click sometimes and other times pressing left click once or twice.
[39:32.62]It's really not that crampy.
[39:39.22]Some of the other classes can be.
[39:43.41]But I've never made a whirlwind hit you with a sword barbarian guy before.
[39:48.93]And I figured, why not?
[39:51.60]Seems like the most easiest thing to do.
[39:53.10]The most easiest.
[40:02.72]You gotta work out more?
[40:03.58]I know.
[40:05.06]Trust me, I know.
[40:05.94]But I don't know.
[40:07.18]I mean, do I though?
[40:09.10]Do I have to?
[40:11.15]I'm gonna be 30 soon, you know, at that point, when you turn 30, dude, who cares?
[40:15.25]I mean, maybe when I'm in my 20s, you know, I wanna, yeah, right, but I'm like turning 30.
[40:25.54]Who gives a shit?
[40:27.44]Let's eat ice cream.
[40:29.32]And drink fucking sodas.
[40:35.05]That's not good to say.
[40:42.03]Don't be a sl- I know!
[40:43.07]I d- I d- I know.
[40:45.91]See, the problem is, because I moved, I have to find, like, a new, good gym that I would like to go to.
[40:53.40]And I really don't even know which- which one.
[40:55.80]Where are these other gifts?
[41:04.94]You going over the hill?
[41:08.54]Kind of am.
[41:12.00]30 is pretty much over the hill.
[41:17.38]Do I need to activate?
[41:18.14]I might as well, just so I absolutely can get it.
[41:26.25]All three is... One, two, three.
[41:32.86]There's the bounty.
[41:34.02]Not bounty, but chest.
[41:35.96]Chest event complete.
[41:43.30]No legendary.
[41:44.39]But I mean, I'm on expert right now.
[41:46.21]That's not good.
[41:54.67]I'm not turning 60.
[41:56.63]If I was turning like 50, maybe you could be like, ah, you're getting old.
[42:05.94]Don't call me old.
[42:06.64]You see how insecure I am about this?
[42:08.18]Don't call me old.
[42:09.18]Don't say you're old.
[42:10.12]Don't do it.
[42:11.41]I'll get extremely insecure about it and I'll be very upset.
[42:13.83]30 is the new 60.
[42:25.27]Oh god.
[42:40.77]You're the youngest guy I know.
[42:44.19]30 is like 80.
[42:44.73]You know what?
[42:46.81]30 is like 80 in internet years.
[42:51.61]Because we all know that 5 seconds in internet time is like 2 hours.
[42:59.35]So that does make sense.
[43:06.34]I just want to open these things and get this over with so I can open my bounty cache thing.
[43:16.11]I don't think I'll ever stop playing games.
[43:30.22]Even when I'm an old, old, old dude.
[43:33.30]I don't think I could stop.
[43:35.98]I really don't.
[43:36.68]I'm so... Like, engraved in this culture that there's no way I'd be able to stop.
[43:43.14]I don't know, though.
[43:49.95]Something might change.
[43:52.55]Maybe, like, when I'm 50 or something.
[43:54.83]Maybe I'll just get into tennis.
[43:58.53]That's the thing.
[43:59.03]You never can know what you're going to do in your life.
[44:02.15]Or what you're going to be interested in.
[44:04.65]Or who you're going to think is cool or whatever.
[44:06.82]I might turn 45 and never play another video game ever again.
[44:10.70]I'll just play tennis and that'll be my big thing.
[44:12.80]And I'll be like a tennis guy.
[44:13.98]I don't know.
[44:21.57]Is there any more of these things up here?
[44:25.17]I don't think so.
[44:25.73]I think I'm just wasting my time up here.
[44:29.04]Did I check over here?
[44:34.44]Golf, like everybody gets into golf.
[44:36.08]What's up with that?
[44:37.12]Right?
[44:39.42]Fuck, I already went over here.
[44:40.70]What's going on with that?
[44:41.95]Somebody explain that to me.
[44:47.19]When... When... For some reason, if you're a man, if you're men, when you get to like 35, 30 plus, you just like golf.
[44:59.94]Everybody that I know that's pushing 30, 30+, 35.
[45:03.20]I'm into golf.
[45:08.78]Why?
[45:09.06]What?
[45:09.32]No, you're not.
[45:09.95]What happened?
[45:11.47]You weren't into golf like two years ago.
[45:14.61]I just decided to pick it up.
[45:15.83]It's a really interesting game.
[45:18.43]No, golf sucks.
[45:22.07]I hate golf.
[45:29.17]You hit balls as far as you can, and then you have to go walk to get them.
[45:40.74]Oh, great.
[45:41.70]Look who... Oh, great.
[45:48.14]No, I'm just kidding.
[45:48.80]Golf doesn't... Golf doesn't suck.
[45:50.49]I'm kidding.
[45:51.93]That's a joke.
[45:53.65]I think the game of golf is an interesting game.
[45:56.73]But I just...
[45:59.51]I just, I can't do it.
[46:01.11]I don't have the patience for it.
[46:03.17]Some people that are really good at golf, sometimes I'll watch, my brother's really into golf, and he'll be watching TV or something, and somebody will make a really good putt, and you're just like, wow, that person is very good at what they're doing there.
[46:20.66]Like, the idea of golf is interesting to me, but the practice for me, like, theory and practice.
[46:25.75]The theory of golf is like, oh, well, yeah, it's an extremely small ball has to go across this entire, like, 50 acre of land and go in a hole.
[46:35.72]That's pretty fucking cool.
[46:38.00]But I just cannot do it at all.
[46:50.40]Yeah.
[46:51.36]It's hard to concentrate on golf when you have ADHD.
[46:53.72]That's true.
[46:55.61]I can't.
[46:56.65]My body physically can't do it.
[46:57.89]And I've gotten very upset about that.
[46:59.59]I went to golf camp.
[47:01.83]Not kidding.
[47:03.23]Not kidding.
[47:03.77]For some reason, when I was like 13 or 14, I wanted to play golf.
[47:08.11]I don't know why, but I did.
[47:09.61]And I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[47:10.81]And I went to a golf camp.
[47:15.10]Uh, I've smashed, like, four golf clubs.
[47:21.16]Because I just couldn't handle it.
[47:23.88]I was at a miniature golf course one time, and I just... Because it's embarrassing, right?
[47:28.38]Like, when you're playing mini-golf with your friends, and you're doing the worst, and you, like, aren't doing well, it really gets to you.
[47:33.80]Because it's like, oh, your friend just made it, like, this is a par three, and he did it in two, he did it in three, he did it in four, I'm on stroke seven.
[47:42.56]And you're just like, they're all thinking I'm an idiot.
[47:46.47]I'm not good.
[47:47.19]I just want to be like par fucking four.
[47:50.43]And that happened a bunch of times, and I remember breaking golf clubs.
[47:53.53]Just like, knee over my knee like a fucking baby.
[47:56.39]Alright, what am I opening here?
[48:02.76]I'm gonna go down this way.
[48:05.12]Okay.
[48:25.36]Listen, Jar, I'm sorry I brought up golf.
[48:27.52]No, no, don't be sorry.
[48:28.76]We talk about all kinds of stuff.
[48:33.71]It's clearly a touchy subject.
[48:39.32]I used to like golf, man.
[48:41.14]I did.
[48:46.93]There's my mini-golf.
[48:47.73]There's my golf story.
[48:50.02]See, I'm just... I don't like golf because I wasn't good at it and it made me angry.
[48:55.36]I'm just disgruntled.
[48:56.32]I'm a disgruntled ex-golfer.
[49:03.49]Where is this last... There it is.
[49:19.43]well thank you take the wheel I really appreciate that that's I'm glad you feel that way alright what if I uh what if my next video was a golf tutorial video like how to swing like how to how to act how to improve your golf game
[49:47.81]And it was really good.
[49:49.23]It was legit.
[49:51.63]You could watch that.
[49:52.25]If you knew golf, you'd watch this video and you're like, wow, that's going to take two strokes off my game.
[49:57.26]What would you guys do?
[50:09.23]Is there really two more of these guys?
[50:10.79]Come on now.
[50:24.65]Like, this video gets linked on ESPN.
[50:27.91]You know, you got the guys just like, oh, we found a video online today, a great way to perform and improve your golf game.
[50:33.99]It's by this gaming video game YouTuber, Germa985, and take a look at it.
[50:45.64]Okay, I can turn in my thing.
[50:56.75]I used to take medicine for ADHD, ADD, and everything like that.
[51:01.41]Long, long, long time ago.
[51:04.43]Very long time ago.
[51:05.31]Alright, let's see what we get in the box.
[51:11.25]Yes!
[51:11.65]Yes!
[51:14.28]A two-handed mace.
[51:15.86]Hopefully that's better than what I have right now.
[51:18.60]And a shitload of plans.
[51:22.14]I don't even have room for this stuff.
[51:38.43]Maybe I could probably make some of these, actually.
[51:40.07]Thank you for coming.
[51:42.28]Oh, Tyrael, please.
[51:43.18]I don't have time for this.
[51:48.38]Oh, just learn them all.
[51:54.65]Okay, let's see what this is.
[51:58.95]Oh, yeah.
[51:59.47]Loot Get.
[52:02.59]Soul Smasher.
[52:06.94]When you kill an enemy, it explodes for 500% of your life per kill as damage to all enemies within 20 yards.
[52:14.66]Eh.
[52:17.28]It's not as good as what I currently have on, unfortunately.
[52:29.43]I need something with a socket.
[52:31.87]Is that still a thing in this game?
[52:33.85]Every single weapon on every character has to have a green gem?
[52:37.47]Or did they fix that?
[52:45.03]I guess I could just trash it.
[52:46.37]Is there a reason to have it right now?
[52:50.19]Oh, by the way, if you're wondering, if you have no idea what the hell I was talking about in the beginning of the stream... Oh, I don't have it yet.
[52:59.80]I have to go actually get it, don't I?
[53:01.21]Because it's the Seasons character.
[53:04.05]I have Blood Shards.
[53:04.75]You know, I could... Let's spend some Blood Shards.
[53:13.97]What do I need?
[53:16.27]What do I need?
[53:16.77]Oh, well, here you go.
[53:17.63]If you want to see what I'm doing.
[53:18.76]Here you are.
[53:21.16]I got Cleave with the... Chill.
[53:24.64]Chill.
[53:26.91]Slows them down a little.
[53:28.91]Hits multiple enemies.
[53:30.85]Whirlwind with the fire guy.
[53:33.43]It does much more damage.
[53:38.40]I also have Ground Stop, which is the pull.
[53:40.84]Just make sure I suck everybody into me so I can start to blend them up, you know.
[53:49.47]Revenge, obviously, because revenge is, I think, has just always been one of the best moves for Barbarian in this game.
[53:55.81]And I just have the super damage one.
[53:57.15]I probably should do the health one.
[54:01.26]But I kind of like damage.
[54:02.70]I like hitting stuff.
[54:05.60]Battle Rage for the crit.
[54:10.02]And the more damage, obviously.
[54:13.30]And then Wrath of the Berserker.
[54:16.36]Just, you know, self-explanatory.
[54:18.59]Explanatory.
[54:21.44]with the extra damage.
[54:24.56]Here are the runes.
[54:26.36]More damage.
[54:28.26]More damage.
[54:30.17]More armor.
[54:31.71]More damage.
[54:32.83]Alright, we've covered it all.
[54:34.19]We did it.
[54:36.95]But I don't know what I want to do right now.
[54:39.86]I don't know.
[54:41.46]I don't know what's like the worst item I have.
[54:47.42]Probably this helmet.
[54:49.84]I want a better helmet.
[54:51.02]Or maybe this.
[54:54.14]I don't know.
[54:57.28]Let's go for a chest.
[54:58.16]I feel like I could get a much better chest.
[55:05.53]Have you heard of an indie game called Minecraft?
[55:08.63]I doubt many have, to be honest.
[55:12.15]You know, I read an article about that game.
[55:14.62]It was in a newspaper.
[55:16.62]And did a
[55:18.65]It seems like it's... You know what?
[55:20.61]Prediction?
[55:21.11]I think that game's really going to take off.
[55:26.80]Give me a Legendary.
[55:27.60]Come on.
[55:29.36]Legendary.
[55:29.80]Come on!
[55:30.36]Yes!
[55:30.80]Whoa, I got two!
[55:31.44]Okay, hold on.
[55:35.92]Increased Ren damage in a socket.
[55:39.14]Pretty much, this is just a rare.
[55:40.51]It's Ancient, though.
[55:41.27]This is an Ancient.
[55:42.39]That means it's a much better version.
[55:46.24]See the orange outline?
[55:52.44]But this item isn't even that good.
[55:55.46]How can this one be an Ancient and not be as good?
[56:00.76]Or be just a little bit better than this one, which is not an Ancient.
[56:07.36]Well, below 25% all attacks are critical.
[56:09.34]That's cool.
[56:12.28]But this thing... This thing kind of sucks.
[56:18.97]Do I want this one?
[56:19.85]Or... I mean, this one has Ren.
[56:22.17]I could probably... I don't know.
[56:25.37]I really don't know.
[56:27.59]I'll put this one on for now just because it has better stats.
[56:31.69]At least for damage.
[56:32.55]And it has a socket I can put in.
[56:34.51]The rest of these can get out of town.
[56:39.05]But how much money blood shards do I have?
[56:40.21]100?
[56:40.23]Alright, we're going for gloves.
[56:44.97]No, I gotta sell some stuff.
[56:55.96]Let me put some of this crap in my backpack.
[56:58.80]In my stash.
[57:08.25]Raider Rift Keystone.
[57:10.13]No, I don't want to put blue boots in here.
[57:14.94]I've done that before and I've left it there and didn't realize it.
[57:17.22]Oh yeah, what do I got in my backpack?
[57:19.08]Blue shit boots.
[57:21.18]Don't do that.
[57:23.76]Don't do that again.
[57:28.37]What kind of music do I like?
[57:30.97]Not much.
[57:32.59]Not much.
[57:36.88]I like weird shit.
[57:38.88]You know what I mean?
[57:42.48]Do I craft this down?
[57:45.50]I'll hold onto it for now.
[57:46.76]Just in case I decide to use it somewhere.
[57:48.71]Should probably use that.
[57:58.60]Mmm, you got into the gorillas because I like yeah, I'm glad because they're They're amazing They're actually coming out with a new album like a real studio album, I believe Can't do any uh maximum rank, okay Okay, let's just open up I'm just gonna open up a rift
[58:27.22]See if I can't get something else.
[58:30.94]Demon Days is a very, very, very good album.
[58:37.61]Demon Days, seriously, is one of the only albums I've ever listened to where almost every single track was a great song.
[58:46.71]Treasure Goblin.
[58:48.35]Treasure Goblin.
[58:50.41]Come here, you little shit.
[58:53.95]I'm never going to catch this guy.
[58:54.85]Now I will.
[58:59.02]Come here!
[59:00.86]No, this guy's going to get away, isn't he?
[59:05.98]I activated... Come on.
[59:09.12]Yeah!
[59:11.34]That's it.
[59:13.88]He dropped a veiled crystal and some garbage rare.
[59:17.00]Are you serious?
[59:25.08]Stylo was a great song.
[59:27.22]All the albums are great.
[59:28.24]All Gorillaz albums are good.
[59:31.52]Sometimes, like, there's a few tracks on Gorillaz albums that are extremely experimental and weird, and you're kind of like, eh, it's a little weird.
[59:41.23]But if there's, like, 14, 15 tracks on a CD, at least 12 of them are going to be awesome.
[59:49.73]Which is why I'm really happy that they're actually going to make another real album.
[59:55.32]You still haven't listened to Demon Days?
[59:56.80]Oh, man.
[59:59.46]It's got so many great artists on it.
[60:03.35]That's why I like Guerrilla so much.
[60:06.55]It's like a combination of a bunch of different people all making the same album.
[60:12.52]It's all collaborations.
[60:13.68]It's great.
[60:27.69]Nephilim.
[60:28.09]There's a whole story with the gorillas too.
[60:37.56]There's like an entire arc.
[60:41.16]Jamie Hewlett, right?
[60:42.02]Is the guy that does all the story and all the artwork and everything.
[60:48.50]It's pretty cool.
[60:52.68]This is a very empty rift.
[60:55.77]Here we go.
[60:57.03]See?
[60:57.29]Blizzard is always listening.
[60:58.33]That's why you need to, like, say how upset you are that there's no monsters.
[61:01.46]Because then you'll get a run like this.
[61:08.62]Wham.
[61:14.40]Do I like Radiohead?
[61:16.58]Um... I... Old Radiohead.
[61:21.79]I don't even know if... Does Radiohead still make albums?
[61:27.12]I'm not going to say I was a Radiohead fan, but there were some songs I thought were good back in the day.
[61:42.88]What other bands did I like?
[61:44.14]Whoa.
[61:58.56]Come here, you.
[62:02.97]I'm trying to think of this one song that I used to like.
[62:04.85]It was a super 90s kid.
[62:13.76]Only 90s kids will get it, you know?
[62:15.28]90s kids.
[62:25.57]Favorite game?
[62:26.25]I don't know.
[62:27.59]It's extremely hard to answer.
[62:37.36]Maybe... I don't know.
[62:45.86]TF2 is up there.
[62:47.92]World of Warcraft is up there.
[62:49.14]Chrono Trigger is up there.
[62:51.48]Mario RPG is up there.
[62:52.74]Neverhood is up there.
[62:56.99]I've played a lot of games over the course of my life, and it's just impossible for me to be like, you know, that one.
[63:17.84]Get right in the middle.
[63:19.89]And, yah!
[63:21.93]See, that move is just so good.
[63:24.45]You can't not have that move.
[63:35.43]Oh, whatever.
[63:35.79]I don't feel like standing around here anymore.
[63:37.99]Just get rid of everybody.
[63:48.31]Psychonauts.
[63:49.31]I've actually never played through Psychonauts.
[63:53.33]I think I started to play it.
[63:56.27]And I just went... I'm kind of tired.
[63:59.26]I'm going to bed.
[64:00.42]And then I never played it again.
[64:06.26]Ooh, you're blocking the road.
[64:14.21]Chrono Trigger... is... has gotta be one of... It's definitely up there.
[64:21.41]The whole Chrono series.
[64:24.17]That's one thing I can't understand at all.
[64:27.25]I cannot understand.
[64:29.31]Square Enix, right?
[64:30.63]We're talking about Square Enix.
[64:32.73]This is a company that...
[64:35.57]They have this franchise that is considered by a lot of people to be the best, one of the best gaming franchises ever.
[64:44.55]Like Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.
[64:49.45]They were supposed to make a third one.
[64:50.93]They were supposed to make a third Chrono game years ago.
[64:54.47]They lost the patent to it because they didn't care about it anymore.
[64:58.55]Square Enix, make the third Chrono game and just halt production on Final Fantasy 61.
[65:05.37]You know?
[65:06.93]Like, do they have to have Final Fantasy again?
[65:09.95]Again?
[65:11.27]Like, make Chrono 3.
[65:14.01]We can wait for Final Fantasy 428.
[65:15.38]You know?
[65:17.78]Just... God.
[65:20.42]I'm real ranty, guys.
[65:21.68]I'm, like, super ranty this morning.
[65:24.66]I shouldn't have picked that up.
[65:31.69]I should not have picked that up.
[65:32.55]Should have went back to it.
[65:42.88]Yeah, they released it for the DS, but they've re-released Chrono Trigger like fucking four times.
[65:48.56]Of course nobody's going to buy it for the DS, because they've already bought it four fucking times.
[65:54.42]We're going to test the waters and see if people like Chrono Trigger still.
[65:58.08]Let's re-release Chrono Trigger four times.
[66:02.17]Did anybody buy it?
[66:03.07]No?
[66:03.45]I fucking wonder why.
[66:13.91]And I understand the original team that did the Chrono games.
[66:19.84]They're all over the place now.
[66:21.18]Some of them work for all kinds of different companies.
[66:23.78]And there's all kinds of licensing and legal issues with any of them trying to come together.
[66:29.02]Look, I get it.
[66:29.88]But it's just unfortunate that when they had the talent there, they didn't capitalize on it.
[66:36.13]That's all I got to say.
[66:40.71]I liked Chrono Cross.
[66:43.31]I think people... I don't think people hate Chrono Cross.
[66:46.95]I think people just... It was a little too much.
[66:51.38]I mean, there was like, what, 100 playable characters in Chrono Cross?
[66:55.12]There was at least like 40 party members in that game.
[66:58.43]And I thought that was amazing.
[67:00.61]I was one of the people that thought that was great.
[67:03.91]Forget these guys.
[67:04.49]I'm just going to keep going.
[67:06.93]Because you could make your own cast of those characters.
[67:11.85]And have your own party that you thought were cool.
[67:14.28]And it was probably different than what other people thought were cool.
[67:18.32]It had this real Wizard of Oz vibe to it.
[67:21.18]Where, oh look at all these characters.
[67:23.27]They're all working together.
[67:24.13]They're all from different bots.
[67:25.49]Awesome.
[67:26.07]I loved that aspect of Chrono Cross.
[67:37.12]I have a Paragon Point to put in.
[67:49.97]Yeah, and, like, the way that they did combat in Chrono Cross was sort of weird.
[67:53.55]You had, like, the percentages to hit people when you went up to them.
[67:56.57]The three different attacks.
[67:58.37]The strong attack, the fierce attack, and, like, the big attack had the chance to miss.
[68:02.55]Like, what, it was, like, a 60% chance you were gonna miss if you did it.
[68:06.34]Everybody had an innate... Everybody was a Pokémon in Chrono Cross.
[68:12.52]You had, like, fire people.
[68:14.44]Water magic people.
[68:16.36]And the fire was good against what... It really was Pokémon.
[68:21.61]Where the hell...
[68:34.86]I did play Banjo-Kazooie.
[68:36.88]Long, long, long, long time ago.
[68:47.41]Ow.
[68:52.49]Oh, no.
[68:53.45]Watch out.
[68:54.09]Serpents.
[68:58.23]I shouldn't be standing here.
[68:59.11]Am I walled in?
[69:00.34]I think so.
[69:06.70]I'm thinking about it now reading some of those things you guys say in the chat.
[69:10.02]Yeah, I am playing like the most boring character you can play in this game.
[69:15.53]Diablo 3 is already kind of like a just chill and just hit stuff game.
[69:20.67]But man, man, this is taking that to the extreme.
[69:28.70]I don't have some, like, cool build.
[69:30.16]Oh, yeah, what I'm trying to do here, guys.
[69:32.06]What I'm trying to, like, every time I hit this person, they freeze, and then I use my freeze move, and then I use my fire move.
[69:37.61]No.
[69:39.33]I just spin around it, people.
[69:41.49]That's what I do in this game.
[69:45.27]No, this is not hardcore.
[69:51.73]I want to make a hardcore character.
[69:52.77]That'd be fun.
[69:57.78]Don't break the flow.
[69:59.20]Just keep spinning.
[70:08.52]I want to see if I can craft some... I didn't even look at that.
[70:11.64]I didn't even look at the things I picked up.
[70:19.97]Oh shit, frozen orb.
[70:22.29]Watch out, frozen orb.
[70:34.74]What is with this guy?
[70:37.28]You're the strongest little dogshit enemy I've ever seen.
[70:39.66]That guy took like eight swings.
[70:47.85]Everybody follow me, follow me.
[70:54.39]I'm not just spin guy, sometimes I'm... Sometimes I'm twirl guy, see?
[71:03.20]I wouldn't say it's equal parts spin guy versus twirl guy, but it's like 30-70.
[71:10.22]I'm okay with that number.
[71:13.98]When are you getting a subscribe button?
[71:15.32]I don't know.
[71:19.49]I have to stream first.
[71:21.75]On a consistent basis before I even think about that.
[71:32.86]And I don't even know if I'm going to be streaming on Twitch.
[71:35.10]I don't know.
[71:35.63]Because the whole YouTube thing and...
[71:40.37]Streaming on YouTube, I don't have to split up the audience.
[71:44.25]You know what I mean?
[71:45.79]Everybody's already there on the channel and all the subscribers get in their feed.
[71:52.19]But YouTube streaming, you lose this aspect, like the talking to chat and reading what people have to say.
[71:59.84]And that really sucks because I like that part.
[72:03.40]So that's, I don't know.
[72:05.10]I don't know.
[72:06.38]I could do both.
[72:07.38]Sometimes I'll do it on Twitter.
[72:08.36]I don't know.
[72:10.47]It's where... It's a tough decision.
[72:18.91]Getting close to the Rift Guardian has found you.
[72:24.20]The Rift Guardian is here.
[72:33.46]Yeah.
[72:34.40]Kiss the chat goodbye on YouTube.
[72:35.56]I know, it's... They seem to be really invested in it, though.
[72:38.96]They seem to really want it to work, and... Hopefully they can get that fixed and squared away.
[72:44.70]Oh, I'm, like, drinking something so I can't hit four.
[72:56.01]Fortune shrine.
[72:58.81]That was a mistake, because I probably could have used that when I killed the Guardian.
[73:03.58]Oh well.
[73:10.26]I guess it doesn't matter.
[73:12.80]Yeah, that's the theory.
[73:14.62]Hitaro, that's the theory.
[73:18.90]Streaming on YouTube allows... Because the biggest complaint that I see from people that... If I tell somebody on my YouTube channel, for instance, if I'm like, oh yeah, by the way, I'm going to start streaming.
[73:31.66]A lot of people are like, oh, I can't really catch streams.
[73:36.52]I like to just watch videos.
[73:38.67]And I understand that.
[73:39.51]I get it.
[73:39.95]A lot of people don't have time to watch a stream.
[73:42.95]If you are a mainly YouTube watcher...
[73:47.57]and you're used to watching 5, 8, 10 minute videos on YouTube and taking a break or marathoning a couple.
[73:55.07]Even if you were to watch 5 of my videos in a row, that's still like 30 minutes.
[74:01.11]It's not like 4 hours.
[74:03.29]So having them just immediately be in a playlist on YouTube where people can at their own leisure go watch them, and the VODs are extremely high quality,
[74:15.62]It is weighing on the decision.
[74:19.30]Because Twitch mods really are not good at all.
[74:25.38]And I don't think the cap for YouTube, I think the data rate cap for Twitch is like $3,000, $3,500.
[74:30.82]It's like way over $10,000, I think, per year for bitrate on YouTube, which is just so much better.
[74:45.45]but Twitch is Twitch and it's just already here and already really good so it's hard it's hard to dethrone and and want to do something like I'm streaming on Twitch right now at the moment it's just like the better platform but who knows
[75:11.76]We'll see what happens in the coming months with what YouTube does with their service.
[75:15.08]I have no idea what's going on right now, but all I know is that the Rift Guardian's here.
[75:21.96]And I have another champion pack here that's causing a small problem.
[75:25.48]I should probably get rid of those first before I do anything else.
[75:38.69]I'm pulling more shit.
[75:40.13]That's good.
[75:45.18]Give me that Nephilim Glory.
[75:50.94]I wonder if I should get the... Oh, no.
[75:52.72]If I'm going to be spinning around, that's not going to be that useful.
[75:55.68]The thing that makes it when you do more damage, the more fury you have.
[75:58.23]I think it's a passive.
[76:08.89]Yeah, Twitch has the whole community behind it.
[76:10.60]It does.
[76:12.58]And that's undeniable.
[76:15.17]YouTube really is going to have to pull something out of their ass if they can even remotely compete with the Twitch community aspect of this website.
[76:26.20]It's going to be extremely difficult for them to even attempt to emulate that.
[76:35.86]Alright, come on.
[76:37.28]Six legendaries.
[76:38.03]I got another one of these.
[76:46.71]Okay.
[76:57.49]Didn't really get anything.
[76:58.41]Let me take a look at some of these rares, because that's better in every way.
[77:06.46]Yeah, it is.
[77:13.20]Those are better, too.
[77:22.25]Is this better?
[77:25.41]Lightning damage, 15%.
[77:26.23]I could change my move to lightning.
[77:31.93]Yeah, that legendary buff on this legendary is stupid.
[77:37.68]Enemies you kill have a 3% additional chance to drop a health globe.
[77:42.38]Who cares?
[77:42.84]Yeah, I'm going to put this on.
[77:46.94]I'll put this on and I'll do... I'll change my...
[77:51.23]Whirlwind to the lightning one.
[77:52.37]This is the only lightning one.
[77:56.21]Gain one fury for every enemy struck.
[78:00.30]Whirlwind turns into lightning.
[78:01.88]Well, I have the plus 15%.
[78:02.62]Well, let's think about this.
[78:06.92]Is that even worth it yet?
[78:09.74]Because if Whirlwind does 340% weapon damage, 15% on top of that would be...
[78:20.26]I don't know if that math adds up quite yet for this for me to be worth it, but whatever.
[78:32.44]It's on.
[78:36.70]Google.
[79:04.13]Greater rift.
[79:07.89]Should I do a greater rift?
[79:08.84]I don't know if I'd be able to do it.
[79:14.72]Probably lose.
[79:15.68]I need to look at something.
[79:36.12]What do I want to look at this?
[79:37.26]Okay, do I have any other lightning moves?
[79:40.12]I do.
[79:44.76]I'll take the more damage one, why not?
[79:47.61]This one has to stay, obviously.
[79:48.79]What's going on, Leon?
[79:53.59]Uh...
[80:02.85]When am I going to make Super Meat Boy Dark World Part 3?
[80:09.19]Is it like 2012 right now?
[80:15.80]That was a long time ago.
[80:23.26]God, this sucks.
[80:25.02]That irritates me that this is the ancient legendary that I got in this character and it's this.
[80:32.90]Oh my god, I had this on.
[80:34.00]It has lightning skill plus.
[80:36.76]How did I not see that before?
[80:38.12]I must have just not cared.
[80:41.84]What else does this thing do?
[80:43.92]That's cool.
[80:49.74]Yeah, Leon, it's been like three years since I last heard or saw you.
[80:55.84]Hey, what's up, dude?
[81:01.20]Hope things are going well.
[81:12.80]I don't even want to reroll anything.
[81:13.96]Let's just put like a fucking random ass gem in here.
[81:16.48]Who cares?
[81:16.96]What should I put in this?
[81:20.58]Strength?
[81:21.84]Probably.
[81:32.35]Yeah, sure.
[81:32.89]Why not?
[81:41.86]Why not?
[81:46.01]How long have I been playing Diablo?
[81:48.97]The franchise?
[81:51.31]Since I was a baby.
[81:57.30]You know what?
[81:57.62]We're going to... I really don't want to do this.
[82:00.54]I'm an expert.
[82:06.53]My character is such a slug, though.
[82:07.85]Hold on.
[82:15.81]Griswold.
[82:21.45]No.
[82:25.77]What happened to the shit that I just picked up?
[82:29.93]This is level 26?
[82:33.01]How dare they give me a level 26 legendary.
[82:40.38]Diablo 3?
[82:41.02]I've been playing Diablo 3 since launch.
[82:43.90]This was one of my most anticipated games ever.
[82:47.24]And at launch... It wasn't... It wasn't so good.
[82:57.49]And I still do have a lot of problems with this game.
[83:01.37]But they're problems that are pretty much not fixable.
[83:06.13]Whoa!
[83:06.59]Okay.
[83:09.41]That's Immortal King's helmet.
[83:15.01]How bad is that strength roll?
[83:18.45]No, they're both pretty good.
[83:26.88]Oh my god, that sixth set.
[83:35.47]Oh my god.
[83:36.13]250% increased damage while you have that active?
[83:40.16]Well, I know what I'm going to try to get.
[83:47.54]Well, this can go on right now.
[83:52.90]Oh, wow.
[83:54.70]Oh, look at my helmet.
[83:56.26]Oh, my God.
[83:57.01]I have antlers.
[83:59.83]I'm so cool.
[84:03.89]Call the ancients last until they die.
[84:05.71]Okay.
[84:10.70]Sounds like a plan.
[84:16.87]Too bad that doesn't immediately make me good enough to turn on Torment.
[84:24.63]I have played Path of the Exile, and I can't physically play it.
[84:30.30]You guys want to know why I can't play Path of the Exile?
[84:33.66]Seems like a really great game.
[84:34.88]Seems like an incredibly fun experience.
[84:37.12]Here's why I can't play Path of the Exile.
[84:45.22]This is why.
[84:48.09]The camera in Path of the Exile makes me want to throw up.
[84:51.95]I think it's a little too close.
[84:53.75]And it's too overhead.
[84:58.13]That's just my opinion.
[85:00.11]Playing Path of the Exile makes me nauseous.
[85:03.47]Physically.
[85:06.15]Unfortunately.
[85:08.74]But what's another bonus?
[85:11.16]I'll do another rift.
[85:11.84]I don't want to do bounties.
[85:12.66]Bounties take too long.
[85:13.60]I already opened it anyways.
[85:18.16]Are you strong enough to survive the trials?
[85:22.70]Yeah.
[85:24.29]I am strong enough.
[85:34.63]I can already feel stronger, guys.
[85:35.73]That Immortal King's helmet, that 1.3% damage, I can feel it.
[85:48.37]I wonder if I should take off cleave.
[85:50.48]Put on something more interesting.
[85:57.30]Oh boy, a bunch of big dudes.
[86:03.37]You know what to do against the big dudes.
[86:04.67]Hit 4 and hold right click.
[86:07.75]Sometimes hit mouse 4.
[86:09.05]Okay.
[86:12.47]Take a look at that.
[86:14.63]See?
[86:14.75]Okay.
[86:30.15]I don't think there's any mods or anything to fix it because I think they actually addressed it a long time ago.
[86:37.10]Changing the camera in Path of Exile would break the whole game because they've balanced the entire game around enemy spawns and aggro leashing and stuff based on where that camera is.
[86:50.14]So if you pulled that camera out, you might see things you're not supposed to see.
[86:54.13]Like enemies spawning in or being able to hit people out of range and all that stuff.
[86:59.73]So I don't know if it's ever gonna get changed.
[87:02.17]I don't think at this point.
[87:03.39]I don't know if I don't see why they would oh My god dudes stars new personal best eight minutes Dude cool.
[87:24.45]He did it in eight minutes.
[87:27.15]I envy him.
[87:28.07]I
[87:32.66]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[87:47.03]Light.
[87:51.91]Uh-oh, big dude.
[87:55.55]No, what?
[87:56.01]Don't do that.
[88:11.65]Channeling pylon.
[88:14.27]Should I get it?
[88:21.18]Not yet.
[88:22.36]Nah, just get it.
[88:24.22]This is a long hallway.
[88:28.96]What does it matter?
[88:29.52]I'd say it was a good time to get it.
[88:35.32]See, I can spam this now.
[88:41.04]Wish I could do that more often.
[88:51.77]Spin down the hallway.
[88:56.83]We're gonna keep going.
[88:57.52]We're just gonna keep going until we can't go anymore.
[89:02.80]Look at how much fun I'm having in Diablo 3.
[89:17.69]Please let me get some more of this stuff so I can put it on a higher difficulty.
[89:24.66]I would put it on torment and just not care, but you saw what happened.
[89:29.10]I won't be able to kill bosses and it'll just be a joke.
[89:44.03]I'm still a fresh 70.
[89:48.40]Level 20 Paragon.
[89:55.91]I hate these big octopus guys.
[90:03.18]I'm stuck.
[90:06.26]I'm stuck.
[90:09.63]I haven't died yet, which is... I don't know why I would.
[90:13.07]This really isn't torment at all.
[90:18.55]At all.
[90:30.67]Come on.
[90:31.79]Oh, I'm gonna fall asleep.
[90:48.48]What are you guys talking about?
[90:49.20]You guys talking about Path of Exile in the chat?
[90:53.38]Is that the topic of discussion?
[91:01.83]We're going to run until we get to another champion because this is... There we go.
[91:05.45]Hello!
[91:12.91]Illusionist.
[91:14.23]That's why they're annoying.
[91:16.03]Are they Mortar too?
[91:18.91]No, I don't think so.
[91:21.33]What else?
[91:21.63]Who took the poison?
[91:24.63]Fuck off.
[91:37.50]Mood changes.
[91:40.16]Just call me the Mood Swing Gamer.
[91:42.49]It's gonna be my new tag.
[91:44.83]Jerma.
[91:45.53]The Mood Swing Gamer.
[91:49.91]Watch out.
[91:50.59]You never know when he's gonna have a mood swing.
[91:58.83]Huh?
[92:01.47]Oh, up here.
[92:12.22]I like the Wizard the best in this game.
[92:15.30]I think it's the most fun and the most interesting.
[92:18.72]I feel like Wizard has way more cool things to do and way more builds you can try than really anybody else.
[92:25.55]Are we talking about League of Legends?
[92:39.14]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:40.74]We're actually talking about League of Legends in this chat right now?
[92:44.15]What's going on here?
[92:46.63]Who brought up League?
[92:48.45]Who did it?
[92:50.35]Who did the Cardinal Sin and brought up a MOBA?
[92:54.82]Anytime you bring up a MOBA, a fight starts.
[92:57.88]It doesn't matter which one.
[92:59.90]You could get two guys in a room that both enjoy Dota, or both enjoy League, and you just say the word League, and all of a sudden, everybody gets angry.
[93:13.64]Hey, we're having, like, a really good time.
[93:15.73]I'm having such a wonderful experience with my friends.
[93:18.71]League of Legends.
[93:20.23]What did you say?
[93:20.81]You said League of... Fuck you.
[93:52.15]I only ever played one MOBA, and that was Smite.
[93:59.85]I actually tried to play the other ones.
[94:04.39]I actually, you know what, I actually played the original Defense of the Ancients on the Warcraft 3 custom game mode server.
[94:14.03]And even back then, I couldn't really get into it.
[94:20.33]But let's stop talking about MOBAs.
[94:22.49]Let's talk about something way more important.
[94:25.17]Dr. Roker's Pizza.
[94:27.14]Crispy.
[94:27.96]Crunchy crust.
[94:29.92]Flavors like you've never experienced.
[94:32.45]Fresh mozzarella cheese.
[94:34.59]Dr. Oakhurst, pick it up today at your local grocery store.
[94:49.72]Hopefully I can get the Guardian to spawn here.
[95:11.49]Damn it.
[95:11.99]No, I want to kill the Guardian with this conduit pylon.
[95:21.85]On my iPad sales?
[95:23.09]Through the roof.
[95:28.31]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[95:30.71]68 million damage.
[95:41.43]Goodbye.
[95:41.79]I'm almost out of juice.
[95:50.46]Well, that was easy.
[95:51.02]I should probably go pick up these things and make this faster.
[96:00.99]Jeremiah Brand lawnmowers?
[96:04.25]I would not trust those.
[96:17.47]I followed your stream like two years ago and this must be the first time I've seen you stream.
[96:22.65]I'm sorry.
[96:23.25]I'm sorry, man.
[96:28.23]I've been bad.
[96:29.73]I've been bad.
[96:30.23]I promise.
[96:32.91]I promise it'll get better.
[96:33.87]I promise I'll stream more often.
[96:38.67]But remember, you're talking about Jerma the mood swing empty promise gamer.
[96:44.79]It's just what I'm called nowadays.
[96:56.46]Come here!
[96:56.90]Alright, I better get a legendary from this.
[97:03.34]If not, then I'm just going to have to rage quit Diablo 3.
[97:15.95]Oh yeah, the book.
[97:17.11]Let's talk about the book.
[97:20.15]I've addressed the book so many times, but not in video format, which I probably should.
[97:29.99]Long story short, is probably like, maybe like a couple thousand words.
[97:36.25]Maybe like 3,000, 4,000 words written.
[97:41.12]And then, I just had no time to do it.
[97:45.42]I got really into it for a while, and then...
[97:49.41]I just didn't have any time.
[97:51.99]Time ran out.
[97:54.07]And every time I wanted to try to work on it, there would be something else that would have to take my attention.
[98:00.05]Every time.
[98:02.59]But it is something that I still want to do.
[98:07.49]And something that I do want to finish.
[98:10.67]But it's just that the time has to be there.
[98:15.04]Because, believe it or not, I think about videos every day.
[98:20.00]And I try to think about something interesting to do, or record, or... You know, sometimes I record, or sometimes I try to record, and I don't upload it because it wasn't good, or I didn't like it, or I didn't think it was fun or interesting.
[98:32.34]It happens a lot.
[98:34.59]So, like, trying to make videos, like, doing real life shit, and... It's just not... I haven't had very much time to sit down and write a book.
[98:45.31]That's it.
[98:48.17]I could be doing it right now.
[98:50.63]I could be doing it right now.
[98:53.72]But then I wouldn't be streaming Diablo 3.
[98:58.86]You know?
[99:03.03]Let's see if there's a chance back here.
[99:04.33]Get out of here.
[99:08.01]You're bothering me.
[99:10.71]You champion pack.
[99:12.05]You guys are bothering me.
[99:14.35]Now they're gone.
[99:15.09]You're not bothering me anymore, champions.
[99:22.68]Your videos seem to require so many preparations.
[99:27.33]No, I mean, it's just... I mean, I had to buy, like, Electro.
[99:32.97]Ooh, a belt.
[99:33.49]A belt.
[99:34.04]A belt.
[99:34.56]A belt.
[99:35.08]A belt.
[99:35.60]A belt.
[99:36.14]A belt.
[99:36.66]A belt.
[99:38.52]What is it?
[99:42.32]Come on.
[99:43.38]Come on.
[99:47.90]It's a rare.
[99:48.92]It's a rare with orange letters.
[99:51.90]I can't fucking believe this.
[99:56.54]Better than what I have on.
[100:06.30]Back to town.
[100:14.81]Yes, there are difficulty settings.
[100:16.27]I'm on one of the lower ones because I want to grab a few legendaries before... Because this was a fresh... When I started this stream, this was a fresh... Like, I hit level 70 the last time I played.
[100:28.12]So I wanted to get, like, maybe two or three new legendaries to increase my character's damage and toughness before I actually decided to embark on, like, Torment.
[100:40.03]But I'm still not going to kill a boss.
[100:43.59]I very highly doubt that our boss will be slain.
[100:50.09]I'm going to class.
[100:50.93]Jerma, please pause the stream for one and a half hours.
[100:53.99]You got it.
[100:54.87]Alright, guys.
[100:56.47]I'm going to just get up from my desk and go take a walk.
[100:58.97]I'll be back in two hours.
[101:00.65]So just a storm flare.
[101:03.87]We're going to wait for you.
[101:05.01]Everybody start waiting right now.
[101:06.92]Let's go.
[101:11.28]See you in two hours.
[101:17.10]See you guys later.
[101:44.27]I'm back.
[101:58.98]I hope he actually doesn't come back for two hours.
[102:03.46]If I didn't have some shit to do today, I probably, I would have just done that.
[102:07.32]But then like, I would forget about it.
[102:09.35]No, I wouldn't do that.
[102:10.31]You know, I would forget about it.
[102:12.25]And I'd sit back down at my desk in two hours and not even know I was streaming and just like start picking my nose and like farting and shit.
[102:19.25]And like, I would call my doctor.
[102:23.20]An embarrassing doctor conversation would be like recorded.
[102:25.94]You guys would all be laughing at me and shit.
[102:36.36]Like, I'd be on the phone with my doctor like, yeah, oh yeah, doctor, can you give me some more of that asshole cream?
[102:43.71]And he'd be like, yeah, sure!
[102:44.97]I should probably get some of these gems upgraded.
[102:58.58]That would not be a terrible idea.
[103:07.07]I remember this being like a waste of money.
[103:12.98]Is this still a waste of money?
[103:14.58]Upgrading these to Imperial?
[103:15.58]Or do you... They just drop, right?
[103:18.11]They just all drop in Torment Plus?
[103:25.79]Hold on a second.
[103:27.62]One second!
[103:30.84]I need a new tab.
[103:33.28]Hold on.
[103:34.08]The frame rate's going to drop.
[103:36.36]It is.
[103:36.66]I know.
[103:37.72]Sorry.
[103:43.87]Frame rate's going to drop.
[103:45.25]Nothing I can do about it.
[103:55.04]What the hell was I doing over here?
[103:56.94]I just totally forgot.
[103:59.11]I just 100% forgot why I even opened up like a tab.
[104:02.78]What am I doing?
[104:04.06]Where am I?
[104:06.06]Okay.
[104:06.60]Well, now I remember.
[104:30.86]There we go.
[104:35.06]Okay.
[104:35.84]Close the rift.
[104:36.54]Give you my experience points.
[104:37.88]Thank you very much.
[104:38.90]I appreciate it.
[104:42.88]Okay.
[104:47.45]It's time.
[104:50.07]It's time to...
[104:58.68]The grammatically correct title in Spanish would be El Dia de El Diablo.
[105:02.14]Really?
[105:02.99]Shit.
[105:06.21]Well, it's okay because I'm not playing Diablo 3 anymore.
[105:09.99]We're going to switch to something else.
[105:14.79]Let me figure out what that's going to be.
[105:16.29]Just give me a second here.
[105:22.22]Whoops-a-daisy.
[105:23.92]Oh, whoops-a-daisy.
[105:27.60]I don't know how I'm going to do this.
[105:28.80]How do I do this?
[105:35.47]Do I even know how to do this?
[105:44.41]You know what?
[105:45.55]I might.
[105:46.27]Yeah, I'll be back.
[105:51.25]I'm actually going to take a bathroom break.
[105:53.73]And then I'm going to set up a different game.
[105:55.09]And it's going to be a mystery.
[105:57.43]So we'll see you in a few minutes when we play the mystery game, okay?
[106:06.24]And by mystery game, I'm going to think of a game to play while I'm peeing.
[106:10.39]So get ready for the mystery game.
[109:25.18]Okay.
[109:33.86]Let's see.
[109:34.45]Let's get a couple of moderators to moderate my Twitch channel.
[109:56.37]Okay, mystery game is not really a mystery, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose the cap here.
[110:07.66]Hold on.
[110:17.79]Hmm.
[110:40.52]Okay, let's open this.
[110:47.77]Let me change this over.
[111:16.03]I wonder if that worked.
[111:18.98]Probably not.
[111:24.30]Hey, it worked!
[111:26.58]Here's the mystery game.
[111:30.02]You guys know this one.
[111:40.41]This is Fistful of Frags.
[111:50.32]Alright, I gotta pick like a secret server.
[111:52.74]No, just kidding.
[111:54.78]I don't even know.
[111:55.92]Do people still play Fistful of Frags?
[112:01.02]I guess.
[112:01.86]I guess we're just gonna go on this one.
[112:08.74]Oh, crap.
[112:09.22]I gotta change the stream title.
[112:40.11]Wait, is this game's bugged?
[112:41.79]How is it bugged?
[112:51.45]Oh, okay.
[112:51.91]We'll, uh...
[112:56.33]Okay.
[112:57.01]Well, um... Well, we'll play something else then.
[113:22.63]Okay.
[113:23.79]Hold on.
[113:27.40]hold on I was a pretty good mystery game
[114:03.90]Alright, Mystery Game Part 2.
[114:09.16]Let's swindle some people.
[114:36.16]Let me just change it so you guys can see it.
[114:39.06]The swindle.
[115:15.76]Okay.
[115:16.78]Let's continue on my horrible, horrible playthrough of this game.
[115:26.32]I need to change the title to Mystery Game Swindle.
[115:36.48]Where's my... There it is.
[115:38.15]There it is!
[116:02.41]Bear with me for one second.
[116:54.10]Oh It's playing the music because I'm like taking too long
[117:05.32]I'm sorry.
[117:05.92]I'm taking forever.
[117:17.71]How badly was I doing in this game, by the way?
[117:25.07]I remember it was pretty bad.
[117:26.37]Alright.
[117:31.67]Let's go.
[117:33.96]Let's stream a video game.
[117:36.18]Where was I here?
[117:40.08]If you don't know what this game is, you steal shit.
[117:43.41]You steal money, and then you run away.
[117:47.77]That's it.
[117:51.49]How much money do I have?
[117:52.43]Enough for some kind of upgrade, I think.
[118:03.80]No, let's just go.
[118:04.64]Let's get back in the swing of things here.
[118:06.28]I don't know how long I'm going to strain this for.
[118:10.10]But maybe like at least five to ten runs.
[118:26.21]Oh yeah, that's right.
[118:28.04]I forgot.
[118:28.50]You have to like hold the button and you have to do left, right, up, down, left, right.
[118:32.62]Sounds like a plan.
[118:41.27]Yeah, it's pretty much if you die here, you don't get any money.
[118:44.65]You're trying to take as much money as you possibly can.
[118:46.39]If I get spotted, the police come and they try to get me.
[118:51.20]That's it.
[118:53.72]You can kill things or knock them out, I think is what you're doing.
[118:57.88]What time is it for me right now?
[119:00.99]It is, I think, noon.
[119:16.56]I hate these little things because they take so many hits.
[119:18.34]They're very annoying.
[119:21.26]Although I can upgrade my baton probably here soon.
[119:24.51]Oh yeah, I can't.
[119:31.51]Move.
[119:33.37]What is that?
[119:33.67]Is this safe?
[119:34.21]Oh, shit.
[119:41.48]Well.
[119:43.84]Those guys insta-kill you if they touch you.
[119:45.46]Forgot about that.
[119:48.63]Did I even get... Can I jump up there, dude?
[119:50.97]Oh, I can't.
[119:51.41]It's a window.
[119:52.25]Shit.
[119:57.04]Well, we're gonna just... We're gonna make out with $364.
[120:00.30]What a heist.
[120:00.72]I got 1% of the money that was there.
[120:03.42]That was terrible.
[120:27.47]Yeah, if I screw this up, I will explode.
[120:30.37]And exploding is bad.
[120:32.31]You don't want to blow up.
[120:34.85]What the fuck?
[120:37.17]Oh, god.
[120:40.37]Let's go hack it.
[120:44.85]I got some money there.
[120:45.89]I'm okay with that.
[120:46.33]That was actually a lot of money.
[120:56.92]Uh, it's not worth it.
[120:58.74]Not worth it.
[120:59.84]Let's just get out of here again.
[121:02.13]I thought this guy was gonna turn his back.
[121:03.89]It's been a while.
[121:08.85]Last time I played this game was the last time I streamed.
[121:13.92]So keep that in mind.
[121:14.90]I gotta, like, figure out what to do again.
[121:18.06]I have, like, don't I have a... Yeah, I do.
[121:19.42]I have bombs.
[121:20.92]I have this, too.
[121:21.62]I can activate that.
[121:25.05]Those guys listen to your footsteps.
[121:26.57]I don't think I can get up there.
[121:32.35]No, I can't.
[121:41.06]This room is interesting.
[121:45.56]How am I going to get rid of that mine?
[121:46.42]I'm going to have to blow it up.
[121:50.22]Damn it.
[121:50.56]This is going to be hard.
[121:52.60]Go... Wait, I'm gonna look for the bird.
[121:55.14]I'm gonna baton the bird in the face, and then... We'll go from there.
[122:02.82]Come on, bird.
[122:06.62]Whoa!
[122:07.50]I got the bird.
[122:08.02]Alright, good.
[122:10.95]That actually worked out pretty well.
[122:12.07]There's no way I'm gonna be able to get that terminal.
[122:21.77]That was the opportunity to go.
[122:22.69]That little dude up there, see the little guy that's jumping around?
[122:24.84]He will one-hit kill me.
[122:30.20]Oh, come on!
[122:31.66]Come on!
[122:35.86]Fuck!
[122:43.73]Whatever.
[122:44.93]Let them come.
[122:45.95]That guy's got a gun.
[122:52.22]The dudes with the guns are scaring me.
[123:00.02]These guys following me around.
[123:01.16]Get away from me.
[123:08.76]Shit.
[123:09.70]Yeah, you die in one hit.
[123:12.46]If anything in there touches you, you're in big trouble.
[123:14.52]But those guys... Actually, I don't think you die in one hit from some of them.
[123:19.79]I gotta go for like an 80%.
[123:29.64]I can get this guy.
[123:30.40]He just needs to be facing that way.
[123:34.04]He's dead.
[123:34.70]Hack the mine.
[123:39.79]Open the door so this guy comes out.
[123:45.53]And then we watch him as he walks over the mine.
[123:49.59]That should happen at least.
[123:52.31]Yep.
[123:55.69]I can't get cocky.
[123:56.47]That's the problem.
[123:57.01]I was getting cocky.
[123:59.13]That's electricity.
[124:02.49]No, we're going around.
[124:03.83]That security camera has to be turned off.
[124:10.84]We need to find the terminal to turn that off.
[124:12.66]It's not up there.
[124:18.83]Stick to it.
[124:21.89]Hmm.
[124:22.07]Hmm.
[124:25.14]Another camera in here.
[124:26.18]Shit, this is a bad, bad procedurally generated area.
[124:34.20]Can anything see me if I get up there?
[124:36.42]No, I don't think so.
[124:38.28]This guy can, but... Stop sticking to the wall.
[124:43.20]That camera's not gonna see me.
[124:45.02]No, it's not.
[124:47.96]There's nothing even in here worth getting.
[124:49.86]That was it.
[124:55.87]We got to go all the way around.
[124:57.03]Cool.
[124:57.45]Awesome.
[124:58.55]Don't want to run out of time either.
[125:08.66]Because you can run out of time in this game.
[125:13.28]Security door.
[125:14.04]They can see out the windows.
[125:16.82]Shit.
[125:18.87]Dude, the gun is... How am I going to get over there?
[125:22.47]There's a camera in here too.
[125:27.15]Gotta lure this guy out.
[125:28.27]Once this guy comes out, I should be okay.
[125:33.53]That's right.
[125:33.95]Get out.
[125:34.77]Blow up all the way over there so you don't hit me.
[125:39.23]That guy's gonna be a pain in my ass if I don't get rid of him.
[125:44.84]Maybe he'll just stay out there or whatever.
[125:46.76]No.
[125:49.04]I'm telling you, this guy's gonna screw me over when I go in here.
[125:51.68]I'm gonna forget about him.
[125:52.44]I'm not gonna care about him.
[125:53.20]He's gonna come in and I'm gonna die.
[126:03.27]Oh, come on.
[126:04.25]What?
[126:06.53]I thought he was dead.
[126:07.57]He landed on the ground.
[126:10.77]He went face first on the ground.
[126:12.34]Usually they don't do that.
[126:13.10]Usually if they need more than one hit, they don't go down like that.
[126:17.10]What the fuck?
[126:20.98]That was a dead person.
[126:22.47]That dude was done.
[126:24.07]If I've ever seen one.
[126:37.23]See, he's down.
[126:38.39]Hopefully he doesn't get up.
[126:43.90]Alright, this thing's gonna turn on if I... There we go.
[126:47.96]Damn.
[126:53.06]27 days till I lose the game.
[127:00.86]This turns off the cameras.
[127:03.02]Which is a very, very, very, very, very big deal.
[127:08.68]Don't get caught by this guy, and don't land on the spikes.
[127:25.52]Somebody just hit me through a door.
[127:26.78]Alright, no, I'm not gonna... I need to get a good run here.
[127:36.40]I don't want to screw this up.
[127:40.68]Nothing else is in here, right?
[127:41.72]Except for one of these birds.
[127:44.40]They're extremely easy to avoid.
[127:45.86]As long as he doesn't do that.
[127:52.54]Guards do not notice broken windows.
[127:54.31]They can see through broken windows, though.
[127:58.11]So it's bad all around.
[128:00.39]There we go.
[128:07.25]I'm just gonna make this explode.
[128:09.15]Yeah, who cares?
[128:13.62]Is there a guard outside over there?
[128:16.22]What the hell is that guy doing?
[128:21.27]There's not much here.
[128:29.27]He's done.
[128:32.05]What did I miss?
[128:36.49]Like, all the way down?
[128:37.48]Oh, I didn't go in the front door because there was a camera, right?
[128:45.34]There's another ATM machine over there.
[128:51.07]Wow!
[128:52.47]That guy can open doors.
[128:55.37]It's all good.
[128:56.95]We're good.
[129:03.42]That's a pretty good amount.
[129:04.26]I'm going to get out of here.
[129:07.60]That's 15,000.
[129:07.98]That's good.
[129:10.22]Those guys opened doors.
[129:11.10]I didn't know they could.
[129:11.68]71%.
[129:11.80]That's fine.
[129:16.21]Automatic Telemachine Machine.
[129:17.51]ATM Machine.
[129:20.15]It's easy to say that.
[129:21.75]ATM Machine.
[129:26.83]Okay.
[129:32.07]Hack speed.
[129:32.73]I feel like... I feel like I like that a lot.
[129:39.01]We're gonna get faster hack speed.
[129:44.25]Extra funds from computers.
[129:46.69]Yeah, definitely.
[129:47.78]Do I have enough for this?
[129:50.86]Yeah, I do.
[129:51.48]Even more money.
[129:54.83]Sweet.
[129:55.93]I'm gonna be getting a lot more money.
[129:59.25]Let's just see how much more money.
[130:12.81]Two birds, one stone.
[130:13.79]You see that one?
[130:17.57]No, that's dangerous.
[130:18.85]Just wait till he comes back.
[130:24.43]These guys got machine robot guards and cameras, but they can't buy stronger windows.
[130:29.33]Yeah.
[130:31.28]If they're so worried about this place, then why have, like, plate glass windows that are extremely smashable?
[130:45.43]That was a three-piece.
[130:47.25]That was just shy of a McDonald's four-piece nugget.
[130:59.14]A lot of people here.
[131:03.23]Shit.
[131:04.55]Greedy.
[131:05.65]Greedy, but it worked out.
[131:09.21]No reason for me to even go over here, but... Don't do it.
[131:12.33]Don't do it!
[131:13.13]Holy shit, I think he was about to explode.
[131:15.25]That's why I did the slow-mo.
[131:25.14]Get out of here, bird.
[131:25.84]Fuck you.
[131:27.82]Wow, that was close.
[131:28.76]That was really close, actually.
[131:30.15]I have to time this.
[131:40.16]I hate when there's a fast guy and a slow guy because I can never determine which one of these guys I have to bash.
[131:44.14]This guy.
[131:46.98]Nope.
[131:49.68]This guy.
[131:54.71]I don't have any words.
[131:57.25]He didn't see me.
[131:59.15]That guy did not see me.
[132:00.71]I hit that guy.
[132:01.77]I jumped on his head and I hit him.
[132:04.25]I was not on that guy's line of sight.
[132:08.21]Bullshit.
[132:11.20]Fucking video game.
[132:16.70]How the fuck does this work?
[132:18.02]How am I supposed to do this?
[132:19.20]I have to come from the other side entirely.
[132:24.98]Get over here!
[132:28.86]Get over here!
[132:30.56]I know you can see me.
[132:31.52]You're pointing the gun at me.
[132:32.78]Just get over here.
[132:34.52]Thank you.
[132:36.44]Now I go around.
[132:46.01]Can the camera point through?
[132:47.35]Probably.
[132:47.93]No.
[132:49.15]Okay.
[132:52.78]Need to worry about the bird and the guy with the pitchfork.
[132:56.40]And then I can turn off all the security.
[132:59.70]That was scary because that bird may have been able to get me.
[133:08.90]Get those cameras turned off.
[133:15.68]Excellent.
[133:17.48]Excellent.
[133:25.34]Wait for the bird.
[133:31.36]Oh shit in my pants.
[133:38.62]Did I hit him?
[133:41.32]Did I hit that guy?
[133:43.50]I kind of just mildly annoyed that guy.
[133:47.81]Did he run over there to die?
[133:48.75]No.
[133:51.57]They have a long way to go.
[133:53.87]So I'm just going to wait.
[133:58.53]He comes back.
[134:01.11]To hack the door closed.
[134:02.75]No.
[134:03.79]I'll screw it up and he'll hit me in the face.
[134:06.37]Just wait for him again.
[134:07.17]Where the fuck did this guy go?
[134:15.97]He's going all the way to the end of the map.
[134:20.40]Yeah, that's really interesting.
[134:21.33]Come on over here.
[134:21.83]Okay.
[134:30.01]That is a lot more money, isn't it?
[134:34.82]Can't go that way.
[134:35.68]Hmm.
[134:44.53]I can't.
[134:45.19]I can't.
[134:46.19]I can't.
[134:46.55]I have to activate that.
[134:50.11]There's nowhere else for me to go, I don't think.
[134:53.75]Come on.
[134:55.79]Come on.
[134:59.35]There we go.
[135:05.00]Don't.
[135:05.24]I can't see what's down here.
[135:08.64]Very slowly.
[135:09.70]Do not just go in the room.
[135:12.18]Oh, God.
[135:12.96]Duh.
[135:19.66]What is my opportunity?
[135:21.68]I don't even think I have one.
[135:25.78]This is such a bad idea.
[135:27.12]Okay, here we go.
[135:34.33]One.
[135:36.13]Two.
[135:40.49]Three!
[135:43.60]Get three'd.
[135:46.14]Get three'd.
[135:52.42]They can't come to the edge.
[135:54.70]Bird, you're really screwing this up right now.
[135:56.58]Actually, this is pretty good.
[135:59.26]Now I can get the bird.
[135:59.78]Because he'll turn right now.
[136:01.95]You fucker!
[136:03.17]Don't do that.
[136:04.75]Don't look at me like that.
[136:05.89]That guy's coming awfully close.
[136:12.59]What the... What just happened?
[136:16.33]One more.
[136:16.71]One more.
[136:19.40]Alright.
[136:20.88]One more guy, and then we can move on.
[136:25.52]That's it.
[136:31.53]Only 5800?
[136:31.79]Alright.
[136:37.13]In every world, this hits this guy.
[136:40.30]Every time.
[136:41.14]Hits that guy right in the head.
[136:43.85]This room's not even worth it.
[136:45.65]But I still... I might just alert him.
[136:47.78]Who cares?
[136:48.32]Just get the money and run.
[136:57.02]And... One more.
[137:03.34]Got that.
[137:06.05]Get this guy.
[137:08.67]And there's a couple more dollars over here.
[137:12.56]Don't even need to hit that guy again.
[137:14.26]Let's go.
[137:15.60]Get me out of here.
[137:18.96]Oh, shit.
[137:20.98]Can I not get out of here?
[137:25.98]Anything in this room worth taking?
[137:29.69]Not really.
[137:32.61]But we're going to get it anyways.
[137:33.83]I'm running out of time, for sure.
[137:35.91]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[137:56.81]Like, I don't understand how that just happened.
[138:01.29]It was going so well.
[138:05.21]Can he see through that?
[138:07.19]It was the spikes.
[138:08.71]I guess I hit the spikes somehow.
[138:15.28]I don't know exactly how I hit the spikes, but I did.
[138:17.88]Apparently at the very end of them.
[138:30.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[138:41.09]No, these are... Oh, this is fucking horrible.
[138:54.22]I died from that?
[138:55.10]This game doesn't like me at all.
[138:58.08]This game hates me.
[139:06.76]Alright, you know, fuck it.
[139:08.38]Screw it.
[139:09.28]It's time just to go fast.
[139:10.68]The quicker you go, the more chance you don't have to screw everything up.
[139:20.87]I thought I was gonna die again right there.
[139:26.69]Oh, the speed thing isn't gonna work here, is it?
[139:37.86]It's not even worth it.
[139:39.32]I gotta find the thing.
[139:40.18]Come back.
[139:51.71]This game is fucking so hard.
[139:54.67]Fuck.
[139:55.85]No.
[139:57.27]God damn.
[140:01.69]I don't even want to know what the last two areas are like in this game.
[140:06.48]Because if it's this difficult to do anything... I don't even want to know what it's going to be like.
[140:23.22]Yeah, after such a good 1, 2, 3...
[140:37.65]No!
[140:38.77]That guy was gonna turn around.
[140:39.90]Alright, am I gonna rage quit this game?
[140:43.20]This is... I can't do this game.
[140:52.21]At all.
[140:55.79]You have to have too much patience to play this game, which I have zero.
[141:04.22]So if I didn't do what I just did, I was going to get shot by that guy.
[141:09.41]Too many patterns.
[141:17.75]I'm going to run out of mystery games to play.
[141:23.67]Fuck, when's my opportunity to do anything here?
[141:30.78]I have to go through this room.
[141:33.40]At least I have to get rid of, like, two or three of these guys.
[141:37.50]No, not worth it.
[141:45.54]I can hack these things, but is it really... I mean, they only activate if you get somebody to look at you.
[141:55.53]Oh, fuck yeah, I do have this shit.
[141:58.07]I totally forgot.
[142:01.10]No, and I don't even know what's in that other room, but it's probably faster to go this way.
[142:11.36]This room's not bad.
[142:12.16]There's not very many people in here.
[142:17.37]It's just these stupid furnaces that fly around.
[142:19.45]I could actually go around and get them from the other side, which is probably much safer, because I look at the window of opportunity I have here is nothing.
[142:29.06]Nothing.
[142:31.20]No, no, not even possible.
[142:32.78]I have to go around.
[142:40.18]He's going to die on those spikes.
[142:41.16]I probably will.
[142:49.07]See if they can see through the windows.
[142:50.07]I don't have a good opportunity here either.
[143:01.12]Did it break?
[143:01.74]I think I broke it, right?
[143:04.82]No, I don't think I did.
[143:10.03]There we go, I broke it.
[143:10.95]Okay, I got it.
[143:16.51]See, the problem is if I jump towards that, I just instantly stick on that wall.
[143:20.19]And I do not want to do that.
[143:21.21]See?
[143:24.03]And then you have to launch off.
[143:29.57]Slowly but surely, I'm going to get in here.
[143:36.29]Let's open this and not die on the spikes.
[143:42.26]Come on out here.
[143:43.20]Come on.
[143:46.18]I know he's going to screw this up if I try to do this.
[143:50.77]Alright.
[143:53.89]Hopefully he's too stupid to come back in here.
[144:01.98]If I open that one, the entire place goes on lockdown.
[144:06.51]So, we're not going to do that.
[144:12.37]There's the security room.
[144:15.35]How far does that guy walk?
[144:17.91]To the edge of the whole thing?
[144:18.79]Yeah, I think so.
[144:19.51]Just want to make sure.
[144:28.84]I'm going to wait until he comes all the way down.
[144:30.20]We're not taking any chances here because I want to do a good run.
[144:36.10]These guys turn.
[144:43.73]Hurry up.
[144:45.81]I don't think I can do this one either because right there is the only opportunity we have.
[144:51.97]Stop sticking on the wall.
[144:56.70]Now I've got to wait again.
[145:00.57]After the little dude comes by and the wheelie guy moves, that's when I can go.
[145:04.11]Like, right now.
[145:04.61]Okay.
[145:11.25]Come on.
[145:12.43]Come on, you fucking... Alright, that guy just did a Jerma, so we're good.
[145:21.52]I don't know how that guy saw me.
[145:23.32]I really don't.
[145:24.30]But we gotta get out of here.
[145:25.18]We gotta get out of here right now.
[145:33.02]Come on, you love to stick on the walls all the time when I don't mean to do it.
[145:36.22]Here come the cops, too.
[145:39.68]This is gonna be fantastic.
[145:42.64]Holy shit, there's like... Why does the... Oh my god, it's like slam.
[145:47.30]What the fuck?
[145:48.24]Stick on the wall and jump.
[145:50.50]Sometimes the controls in this game just don't like to work.
[145:58.02]I don't want to die from a fall.
[146:02.31]Well, let's go.
[146:02.91]I got half the money.
[146:08.11]Whatever.
[146:08.39]I need to get to 20,000.
[146:15.25]Once I get to 20,000, then I'll be okay.
[146:18.01]Wow.
[146:26.63]I can get through this room.
[146:27.45]There's only one guy in the other one.
[146:34.87]And... Activate this.
[146:39.44]Shit, I didn't time it well enough.
[146:41.54]Actually, I don't think I probably... I probably couldn't have killed those guys anyways, I don't think.
[146:47.42]Oh.
[146:48.80]Shit.
[146:49.77]Whoa!
[146:51.61]Bad spot.
[146:52.53]Really bad spot.
[146:57.85]What does that guy do?
[146:58.51]That guy has... That guy holding an ice cream cone?
[147:02.04]Oh no, it's a skull.
[147:08.99]Huh?
[147:12.25]What happened?
[147:16.15]I don't even understand what happened.
[147:19.81]Did that guy kill me?
[147:22.19]Apparently, I guess.
[147:24.74]I have no idea.
[147:26.86]How?
[147:35.92]Watch out, watch out.
[147:50.52]Come on!
[147:58.83]Three down.
[147:59.21]There's nothing in this room.
[148:05.89]Judging by what happened last time, it's going to be very hard to hit this man.
[148:09.79]And I have to hit him twice, so I... No, why can you not just hit him like this?
[148:16.02]It's such... You know, we're going to drop a bomb.
[148:20.74]I forgot I had these.
[148:23.42]I totally forgot about this.
[148:25.58]No, it wasn't yet.
[148:26.22]This is...
[148:35.06]Let's do another one.
[148:35.86]I can just grab this and maybe be in a better position.
[148:40.66]Hopefully.
[148:41.73]Do I have any more bombs?
[148:55.30]So the goal here is I can possibly activate that mine and get out of there.
[148:59.32]No, I can't.
[148:59.94]No way.
[149:00.30]Look at this.
[149:01.18]Not a chance.
[149:03.26]Does invisibility trigger a mine?
[149:04.97]Do I still have a bomb?
[149:07.59]I might be able just to bypass this entirely.
[149:10.21]Well, I don't want to... I don't want to blow the... Will I blow up the... We'll find out.
[149:18.61]We will find out if I blow up the machine.
[149:20.85]I don't.
[149:23.07]But I do blow up the door.
[149:24.25]Shit.
[149:27.77]Well, at least I have a much better opportunity...
[149:41.48]Go.
[149:50.07]Perfect.
[149:56.43]Get that out of the way.
[150:02.54]No.
[150:05.00]No, I mean, is the... Am I invisible right now?
[150:10.18]I don't even know.
[150:10.72]I'm scared to even determine if I was.
[150:12.76]Because if that guy saw me, it would have been over.
[150:15.06]Cameras are turned off.
[150:15.80]Let's go back over here.
[150:18.62]Watch out for the ice cream cone skull guy.
[150:26.35]It's down there.
[150:30.79]There's a room down here.
[150:37.87]How far does that guy's line of sight go?
[150:46.47]Shit Cloud man Oh no I can't do cloud man This is brutal How far does his line of sight go?
[151:15.40]Not far enough.
[151:16.76]Sucker.
[151:23.84]If we still had bombs, I would just drop one down here.
[151:32.04]Okay.
[151:34.24]I gotta get another one, two, three.
[151:37.44]I gotta get another one, two, three.
[151:40.38]Here we go.
[151:41.92]One, two, three.
[151:46.23]No, I mean, no.
[151:49.69]One.
[151:52.45]One.
[151:54.85]One, two, three.
[151:58.49]Oh!
[151:58.65]Another one, two, three.
[152:03.88]One, two, three.
[152:14.10]Three.
[152:20.63]Good to go.
[152:22.57]Just activate this.
[152:23.43]Don't die on the mine of all things.
[152:28.21]Nothing over here, right?
[152:32.26]13,000.
[152:33.70]I think that's good enough.
[152:35.04]Unless I want to get greedy and get this.
[152:36.46]I do.
[152:40.15]Alright, let's get out of here.
[152:42.13]Actually, maybe, let me see.
[152:43.03]Is there anything else?
[152:44.35]No.
[152:45.21]No, not anything.
[152:46.26]Let's just... Fuck this.
[152:51.26]I got two computers.
[152:52.22]I got 13,000.
[152:52.44]Get me out of here.
[152:53.64]60%, just about.
[152:55.04]That's okay.
[153:06.60]This game looks like a whole bucket of fun.
[153:10.62]It's... It's very... It's very unforgiving.
[153:13.70]I'll say that.
[153:14.15]Increase the speed of your backpack and recharge the steam.
[153:23.65]Bugs placed near stock computers.
[153:25.62]Okay.
[153:26.36]That's cool.
[153:29.50]What's this?
[153:30.04]Lightning bolt?
[153:32.66]EMP.
[153:33.54]Is that worth it?
[153:39.27]I can get more money.
[153:43.11]This is the maximum amount of money I can take.
[153:46.60]Smash through doors and windows.
[153:51.54]I'll buy the bug.
[153:52.54]I'll give the bug a try.
[153:53.78]How much is it?
[153:55.54]25.
[153:59.42]I'm interested in that one.
[154:00.57]How much is the EMP?
[154:08.33]30,000.
[154:08.45]Okay.
[154:09.63]That's next on the list.
[154:13.59]I'm going to buy the EMP, and then I'm probably going to stop streaming.
[154:20.72]Hold right trigger to open.
[154:21.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[154:25.90]Near computers to funnel funds directly to your bank account.
[154:29.45]Okay, so even if you lose, it's not a big deal.
[154:33.15]Let's get one prepared.
[154:36.75]You see what that guy just did?
[154:37.59]You see that?
[154:37.97]You see how that guy was just about to instantly kill me?
[154:41.11]If I had done that?
[154:46.88]Do you want to stream every day or I'll tell people you eat your boogers?
[154:51.50]Good for you.
[154:52.20]I do eat my boogers, so... You're not going to be scaring anybody away.
[154:56.56]I eat my boogers every day.
[154:58.86]So, go ahead and tell.
[155:02.11]That's a very long time.
[155:10.33]I'm scared of what this guy's gonna do.
[155:11.35]What the fuck?
[155:18.93]Come on!
[155:20.39]I'm like gluing to walls.
[155:24.89]So, if I put this down here... Plus 36, plus... Does that just stay on there?
[155:32.53]Forever?
[155:33.23]Or does it just do it until this is empty?
[155:34.87]I guess we'll find out, right?
[155:39.57]There's another one over there.
[155:40.37]36.
[155:42.95]It's still going.
[155:44.39]Usually there's, what, about 6,000 or 7,000 in each computer?
[155:52.65]It's got to be getting close by now, right?
[155:54.77]Maybe around 2,000 or 3,000.
[155:55.81]Until it's empty.
[156:05.14]That's cool.
[156:13.41]So, I'm just going to hack this one.
[156:15.47]Because why not?
[156:18.58]It's still going.
[156:19.36]Alright, so let's just say I'm going to just do this.
[156:22.22]6600.
[156:25.58]That thing's still going.
[156:28.74]That thing is still going.
[156:30.60]What if I put one here?
[156:31.26]Is that supposed to be happening?
[156:39.11]Ugh.
[156:41.80]I kind of just want to sit here and let it just drain.
[156:44.66]Yeah, that's still going.
[156:51.28]Even after I cleaned it out.
[156:52.24]Okay.
[156:55.90]Bug is waiting for the computer to be refilled?
[156:59.60]I don't know what that means.
[157:08.49]Did the enemies refill them?
[157:11.67]Whatever.
[157:12.07]I'll take it.
[157:14.33]I will take it.
[157:15.71]That's for sure.
[157:25.29]This is an easy room.
[157:30.32]Just have to be patient.
[157:35.16]I can't take it anymore.
[157:37.04]I have to open the door.
[157:37.80]I have to open the door right now.
[157:40.60]I gotta open the door right now.
[157:41.37]I gotta open it.
[157:41.81]I gotta open it.
[157:42.27]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[157:53.33]It'll drain even if you end the level.
[157:54.85]That's pretty sweet.
[158:01.40]Stop sticking to walls.
[158:05.18]I gotta get out of this room.
[158:08.26]Screw that thing.
[158:14.23]No money.
[158:16.61]Not worth it to go in that room.
[158:18.89]The only way I'm going to do that is if there's another big terminal.
[158:21.87]There's one down here.
[158:23.40]No, there's not.
[158:27.30]I think I got all the terminals.
[158:30.18]Yeah, it's just kind of jump change lying around now.
[158:34.46]I think I'm just going to go.
[158:36.86]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[158:37.72]You can't go when there's another terminal like this.
[158:40.62]Still got bugs?
[158:41.30]No, I don't.
[158:44.94]Holy shit, I almost just got seen.
[158:57.22]Get... Get... ...away from me.
[159:07.57]One more guy.
[159:10.23]Oh, he's in a bad... He's in a really awkward position.
[159:12.63]Okay, we're good.
[159:21.00]It's not worth it.
[159:21.84]It's not worth it.
[159:22.46]That mine might... Not worth it.
[159:25.56]See you later.
[159:34.15]94%, finally broke 75% for the first time this whole time I've been streaming.
[159:39.48]Interestingly enough.
[159:42.74]Alright, what can we do now?
[159:43.48]I haven't got anything in goggles.
[159:52.56]Shows you your noise.
[159:57.73]That's handy.
[160:04.01]Puts more things on the HUD, I guess.
[160:09.31]Shows you all the money.
[160:10.11]These are all useful.
[160:12.39]How much are these?
[160:12.99]They're all expensive.
[160:13.79]Hmm.
[160:25.90]What does the EMP grenade do?
[160:28.65]What does it actually do?
[160:31.43]Some tools.
[160:35.06]An intense electromagnetic field transmitted from your backpack.
[160:39.73]So it fries the circuits?
[160:42.98]Let's go for it.
[160:50.71]Alright.
[160:51.87]We'll do three more runs regardless of what happens.
[160:54.61]Look, I'm not even like... I lost the game.
[160:57.84]Without a doubt.
[160:59.34]I'm not even at the halfway point.
[161:01.24]This is like the halfway point.
[161:02.96]And I only have like 17 days left.
[161:04.40]Yeah, this is a wash.
[161:06.18]It's over.
[161:07.28]I'm never gonna beat this one.
[161:12.48]I already know about that.
[161:17.18]So I just wanted to see what this does.
[161:18.44]I'm just curious.
[161:21.07]How close do they need to be for this to work?
[161:24.72]Okay.
[161:26.48]So in that square, whoever's in that square will be disabled.
[161:29.36]I understand.
[161:30.96]Just needed to see what it did.
[161:34.38]Really?
[161:40.85]Come on down.
[161:42.69]Why did that not do anything?
[161:44.85]Why?
[161:45.71]Yeah, it...
[161:51.25]That's my mind!
[161:52.45]Explode, man!
[161:53.29]This is not my... I am very confused.
[161:59.77]Usually that works.
[162:00.93]This guy would have been dead.
[162:06.61]30 seconds ago.
[162:14.94]Camera.
[162:22.27]At least I got rid of them.
[162:23.41]Okay, that was actually a really good thing that I just did.
[162:26.99]Oh, the mine is EMP'd.
[162:29.03]Okay, I get it.
[162:32.07]I get it.
[162:33.29]Bird, please do not.
[162:35.29]Please!
[162:41.13]This is great because me blowing up this spot right here made it so I can get these guys so they're not going to run all over the place.
[162:50.38]If they come back.
[162:57.97]The bug is still draining money?
[163:03.33]That bug is still draining money.
[163:05.45]What?
[163:07.17]No way.
[163:09.17]Does it do that forever?
[163:10.13]Holy crap.
[163:18.58]Oh, wow.
[163:19.30]That's...
[163:22.00]That's good to know.
[163:22.75]Why have these guys not run back yet?
[163:24.53]Where were they?
[163:25.61]Where the hell were those guys?
[163:27.23]And why did they... What the fuck happened?
[163:29.53]What is going on?
[163:30.35]Where did... They run... I... Stop talking and just freeze.
[163:40.54]What was that?
[163:43.00]All four of those guys are just stuck in the wall over there?
[163:47.50]What the hell was that?
[163:52.33]Am I gonna beat this game because of a bug in the game?
[163:55.19]I'm just gonna like sit here and just get like 500 million dollars.
[164:05.16]Wow, that was close.
[164:08.75]That was really close.
[164:15.01]I don't want to put another bug down.
[164:33.09]Is that- is that me coughing?
[164:34.57]Shit's like blowing up.
[164:46.37]Alright, the coughing has ended, but the money is still going.
[164:52.62]Look, now it's telling me how to use the EMP.
[164:56.81]Forget the EMP, man.
[164:57.83]I want to use the bug.
[165:09.78]Why do I think that's that funny?
[165:12.28]Should I put another bug down and maybe it'll double my efforts?
[165:16.50]Or should I just leave it alone and just continue to get the drain into my bank account?
[165:20.99]What do you think?
[165:23.11]What do you think?
[165:23.91]Let's see what you guys say.
[165:26.19]Should I put a bug down or just let it ride?
[165:38.22]I'll wait.
[165:38.98]Let's see what you guys say.
[165:45.15]Here's another one.
[165:45.97]Do it.
[165:46.65]Bug it.
[165:47.01]Two times bug.
[165:47.79]Double or nothing.
[165:48.49]Another bug.
[165:49.03]Bug.
[165:49.33]More bugs.
[165:49.93]Got it.
[165:50.33]More bugs.
[165:55.09]Yeah.
[165:56.11]That's going double.
[165:59.13]Yep.
[166:03.54]Wow.
[166:05.00]What a totally cheeseball way that I'm going to probably beat this game.
[166:13.76]I'm just gonna, you know what?
[166:14.39]I'm just gonna go home.
[166:15.87]I'm just gonna go home.
[166:18.77]Who needs to break into facilities when you got a couple of bugs that just drain money?
[166:26.76]You guys see how bad I've been at this game?
[166:29.11]I'm going to win it.
[166:30.29]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[166:33.77]Somebody just gassed me?
[166:37.25]What does this mean?
[166:41.91]Oh, that's what the ice cream cone guy does.
[166:46.70]Probably shouldn't be standing near him.
[166:48.28]My guy's getting drugged.
[166:49.58]Oh, shit.
[166:53.46]Oh, god.
[166:54.28]I'm dead.
[166:58.36]Hey, don't worry, guys.
[166:59.00]It doesn't matter.
[167:00.20]It doesn't matter.
[167:01.04]If you die, I can die as many times as I want.
[167:03.56]I'm still draining money.
[167:10.79]I think the other one stopped.
[167:11.83]I don't know.
[167:17.17]I don't really know what's going on.
[167:24.95]All I know is I'm still getting money.
[167:33.34]Boink.
[167:35.40]I should... You know what?
[167:37.52]Give me the EMP.
[167:39.24]Fuck you.
[167:42.79]Now is this guy done?
[167:44.13]Or will he come back up in like ten seconds or something?
[168:01.53]I can put this up here.
[168:04.61]Oh, shit, it's too far.
[168:05.94]Well, I didn't know that.
[168:07.04]Can I pick it back up?
[168:10.38]Shit.
[168:11.24]I can't.
[168:11.64]I'm going to drop a couple of bombs, though.
[168:18.00]Is that going to... No, that's not what I wanted.
[168:31.00]That's not what I want.
[168:32.44]This is going to be extremely difficult.
[168:35.10]How long does this last?
[168:41.39]Off the fucking mine.
[168:42.71]Alright, well, I'm actually kind of glad because now I can bug another computer.
[169:04.89]That was easy.
[169:15.04]Yeah, I'm gonna try to put this one directly on it.
[169:21.50]Put the bug, like, right here.
[169:23.03]51, yeah.
[169:28.37]Yeah!
[169:30.49]Look at that one.
[169:37.10]So, the theory here now, I can pack this still.
[169:41.01]I can pull the money out, right?
[169:46.59]Or should I just leave it alone?
[169:54.91]Kill the guards, okay.
[169:57.71]This guy's gonna be a tough one to kill.
[170:01.31]Can I even make this jump with a double jump?
[170:02.89]I'm scared to try that.
[170:05.60]So, I'm gonna go around.
[170:11.84]These guys listen to noise.
[170:17.62]So isn't there a sneak button here?
[170:30.37]Jump, jump, jump.
[170:35.41]Come on, latch onto that.
[170:38.33]Come on!
[170:46.29]You... Don't even try it anymore.
[170:49.03]We're going.
[170:50.44]No, we're not.
[170:51.82]Now we are.
[170:55.36]That... Just look at where that mine is and where that guy is.
[170:58.20]This is not going to be good.
[171:00.20]This, in fact, is going to be really bad.
[171:03.28]No.
[171:06.26]Okay.
[171:07.82]We're on top now.
[171:09.35]Somehow.
[171:12.73]So it doesn't have anything to do with the hack state of the computer.
[171:14.53]Okay, I'll go hack that one in.
[171:17.47]I will go pull the money out of that one.
[171:18.87]I just don't want to fall into something.
[171:29.86]Okay.
[171:31.08]Alright, well.
[171:34.94]Alright.
[171:35.34]I'm going to blow this wall up.
[171:41.13]Yeah, we're going to take out this wall.
[171:46.43]What?
[171:48.21]My bank account's being leeched by... Oh yeah, that's right, there's some... Isn't it... Is it right here?
[171:53.60]Oh, it's this guy.
[172:00.32]Don't leech my bank account.
[172:04.49]I just got the guy, didn't I?
[172:09.21]How dare you leech off of my bank account that I'm leeching.
[172:13.91]Where is this other guy?
[172:18.91]You know, this guy can, like, leech all he wants.
[172:20.81]It doesn't matter.
[172:21.41]Is there more than one?
[172:24.94]There has to be more than one of them.
[172:26.04]But I can't get to the other side of the roof.
[172:30.16]Whatever.
[172:34.94]What's going on?
[172:37.36]What the hell?
[172:38.45]What just happened to me?
[172:40.69]My character was standing up fine and it was just over?
[172:42.45]I'm dead?
[172:42.81]I'm dead.
[172:47.99]From that fall?
[172:48.69]That fall shouldn't have killed me.
[172:50.91]You saw, my guy was like still standing up.
[172:53.09]Come out here.
[173:10.77]Died of old age.
[173:13.70]Alright, this is the last run.
[173:16.22]So, I'm gonna make this one count.
[173:18.14]I'm just gonna walk off fucking cliffs.
[173:27.82]What's up in this room?
[173:34.77]Give me a good entryway.
[173:45.83]Whack.
[173:49.09]Doesn't matter if this guy hears me or not.
[173:50.57]Can't do anything.
[173:57.25]Just... I'll leave you.
[173:58.31]I don't give a crap.
[174:05.38]I need a computer.
[174:14.40]Why are the computers in this damn place?
[174:15.78]I mean, there's a security room.
[174:23.57]Come on.
[174:30.79]Come on up here.
[174:33.41]He was on his way up, too.
[174:34.31]That sucks.
[174:38.82]I'm scared to jump any further, but... Break these...
[174:46.53]I'm so scared he's gonna just rip around, I know he will.
[174:48.65]Let's just turn them all off.
[175:11.83]Oh shit, my bug was destroyed at one of those places.
[175:16.82]That's not good.
[175:17.34]Is there anything even over here that's worth me coming over here for?
[175:26.59]I don't think so.
[175:27.21]Let's take a look.
[175:29.73]No, not really.
[175:36.71]Where's the money?
[175:39.35]Where is the money in this place?
[175:51.42]Clutch on, jump over.
[175:52.80]Aye, aye, aye.
[176:05.65]Yeah, right.
[176:06.37]Yeah, right.
[176:09.37]Just keep in mind, I want everyone to keep in mind, that fall didn't kill me.
[176:12.55]And the one before did.
[176:13.93]Just keep that in mind while we're still sitting here.
[176:18.02]Just keep that in mind.
[176:23.19]It's not even worth it.
[176:23.77]There's nothing in this room either.
[176:28.89]Alright, time to... I'm going to start dropping some bombs.
[176:31.29]Because there's not really anywhere to go.
[176:33.25]I can go up here.
[176:34.76]What's the point of going up here though?
[176:37.52]I'm just going to keep going down.
[176:54.28]it's the only one just drop them just drop a bug on it we'll be done with it this guy would get away from the door so I can open it that one is locked with the security but does it matter can the bug still be on it I would assume right
[177:28.67]I feel like I'm, yeah, I feel like I was not high enough for that one.
[177:36.37]Those guys are usually much faster.
[177:37.71]What's going on here?
[177:38.43]Look at how much money I have.
[177:40.82]Holy crap.
[177:45.15]So you... I just realized how you beat this game is you get to $20,000, buy the bug immediately, and just start planting bugs everywhere, and you'll win the game in less than probably 30 or 40 days.
[178:00.09]Come on.
[178:10.23]Keep going.
[178:12.01]Keep going.
[178:14.53]Getting locked out.
[178:16.89]Close the door!
[178:17.44]Close the door!
[178:18.00]Why did the door not close?
[178:20.78]Wow.
[178:24.28]What was up with that?
[178:25.08]Alright, let's drop the bug.
[178:27.26]I guess it's not right on top of it.
[178:33.87]I thought it was.
[178:50.77]Oh, did I actually not get the... Oh, I was hitting the shock trap?
[178:56.19]No, I did, right?
[178:57.82]Oh, I guess, yeah, you're right.
[178:58.66]You guys are right.
[179:00.08]You're right.
[179:00.40]I'm scared of this guy's range and the spikes and shit.
[179:15.03]And the mine.
[179:22.52]Those guys have long range, man.
[179:27.09]Some would say too long.
[179:34.99]Why?
[179:36.23]Why?
[179:36.69]I hit that guy right in the head.
[179:40.07]I did that.
[179:40.49]I already did that.
[179:41.45]You saw I did it.
[179:42.11]This game's gonna give me a fucking heart attack.
[180:02.99]At least I got the grenade turned off.
[180:07.42]There's nothing over here.
[180:08.46]There's nothing over here.
[180:09.18]I bought that for like one save with a hundred bucks in it.
[180:11.82]No.
[180:12.18]Bye.
[180:15.45]Yes.
[180:16.33]Yes, I did almost walk into those spikes if you were curious.
[180:19.03]Yes.
[180:19.23]Yes.
[180:39.10]If I hack that computer, there is a chance that... Because when you hack those computers, it alerts everybody.
[180:45.00]The ones with the red with the block on it.
[180:47.50]And if I do that, there is a chance that I might just die.
[180:52.01]And although I don't even have any money.
[180:53.53]Who cares, right?
[180:57.43]Whatever.
[180:58.17]I got a bug on something.
[181:00.42]See, it don't even matter.
[181:01.94]See what...
[181:09.08]I just, I just, whatever.
[181:10.34]Alright, this is it.
[181:13.00]The last attempt, the last round.
[181:16.44]Last one.
[181:16.94]Let's go for 90%, let's go for 90% in this one.
[181:19.30]I want at least like 80 or 90% of the money.
[181:37.92]That's too dangerous to get right this second.
[181:42.00]So is that.
[181:52.09]Little frog guy.
[181:52.87]That's an instant kill.
[181:57.87]Come on!
[182:01.65]Got ya!
[182:03.48]Oh, this is actually a good opportunity to get this guy.
[182:08.51]Yikes, that was close.
[182:10.59]Gotta hit him twice.
[182:14.36]He's done.
[182:17.98]Give me the bug.
[182:39.42]There's a bird here.
[182:43.52]You bird fuck.
[182:46.28]Please, just get away from me.
[182:50.38]You bird, you're ruining my stream.
[182:53.58]You're ruining my stream, bird.
[182:54.94]I want it to be, like, right on top of it.
[183:08.57]So that's going to keep going.
[183:09.35]Yes, it is.
[183:09.87]Make sure this guy doesn't do anything sneaky.
[183:21.28]Keep moving.
[183:24.58]Camera.
[183:28.92]I still think this one is doable.
[183:31.44]Without having security cameras go off.
[183:39.30]I can get him when he comes back around again.
[183:41.32]Here we go.
[183:43.27]One, two, three.
[183:44.19]Let's take a look at the situation here.
[183:52.57]Could EMP it?
[183:53.45]If I EMP, will that turn off the ATM?
[183:56.13]That's what I'm concerned about.
[183:57.17]Because that's a good opportunity to me to get in there.
[184:10.29]Could just go get the security room, but I don't know where it is.
[184:26.74]Where is the security room?
[184:28.68]Is there even a security room in this level?
[184:34.44]Is this room over here the one on the left?
[184:42.57]Yeah, I'm not even sure there's a security room in this level.
[184:44.37]Maybe it's below.
[184:48.16]Alright, no more fooling around.
[184:49.60]Let's go.
[184:52.26]No, no, no, no.
[184:55.44]I gotta wait till the camera comes back this way and then turns.
[184:58.46]And then we're done fooling around.
[185:03.71]Here we go.
[185:05.15]Fun and games are over.
[185:19.71]Okay.
[185:22.13]Is the security room right there?
[185:24.98]No, it's not.
[185:26.88]Shit.
[185:34.18]Still might be possible to do this.
[185:37.48]I probably can EMP the camera, but if I EMP the camera, do I EMP the machine?
[185:44.63]That's what I don't know.
[185:46.63]Well, good opportunity to test it and see what happens.
[185:50.55]It is right now.
[185:52.71]I'm just going to go over there and just EMP.
[185:58.90]Doesn't turn off the camera.
[186:02.16]Cannot.
[186:03.50]I can't believe I just did that, by the way, without being seen.
[186:07.20]And yes, it destroys the computer.
[186:09.24]Okay.
[186:09.80]Well, that's good to know.
[186:12.57]Good to know.
[186:13.41]Now how do I get down here?
[186:21.42]Okay.
[186:25.24]Alright, I guess I have to use grenade bombs to get down here?
[186:30.75]I guess we'll just do bombs.
[186:44.19]gotta find a oh my god you see see sometimes sometimes I've noticed this and I this is I'm not crazy sometimes I'll press I'll press my a button now and I and it won't happen it's just it just doesn't it didn't work have that flip flip that room sucked anyways see what happened what happened let's just leave and come back
[187:13.02]Is it my controller?
[187:14.58]Like, my controller's broken.
[187:18.19]Sometimes I'll jump and my jump won't jump and I'll hit the jump button and it won't do anything.
[187:24.67]I don't know how crazy I am.
[187:25.83]I've probably been pretty crazy, but it's not the first time that I've noticed that.
[187:32.87]Oh my god, I didn't think he was going to follow me up there.
[187:38.53]Well... Oh, what am I doing?
[187:41.05]I'm an idiot.
[187:46.37]Come back to the airship.
[187:48.33]Buy the next area.
[188:01.66]Where is the security clearance?
[188:05.66]How much is it to go to the next area?
[188:06.94]$100,000.
[188:12.68]Holy shit.
[188:18.72]Almost there.
[188:19.22]I'm almost there.
[188:27.37]I'll get to 100 grand and then I'll unlock it and take a look at it and then stop streaming.
[188:48.19]Bug.
[188:59.08]Keep moving.
[189:00.00]Let's open up more stuff.
[189:06.76]The birds... You know what really screws me up is these birds because they go so slow and you just have to sit here and be like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[189:13.57]He's going to come all the way across, isn't he?
[189:26.32]Alright, they have enough money.
[189:28.16]Just don't die.
[189:42.14]Just in case I run into some trouble here.
[189:48.08]You bird!
[189:52.80]I hate you bird!
[189:54.16]I hate the birds!
[189:56.41]Oh, goodie.
[189:58.69]You tripped my mind.
[190:13.03]I'll wait.
[190:14.72]I'll have patience.
[190:24.23]Oh, you slow molasses son of a bitch.
[190:29.90]I didn't have any more bugs yet.
[190:35.04]I'm going to use the bug in this level.
[190:40.51]This guy's going to be annoying.
[190:42.93]Got ya.
[190:44.55]Got ya.
[190:51.87]Dangerous.
[190:52.29]This is so dangerous.
[190:53.09]I'm going to fall off this.
[190:54.19]I'm going to fall off this and die.
[190:57.97]Yeah.
[190:58.61]No.
[190:59.07]Yeah.
[190:59.83]No.
[191:00.29]Let's go.
[191:01.65]That is a very bad idea.
[191:05.16]Too high of a wall.
[191:06.60]Extremely bad idea.
[191:07.62]Let's go up this way and see if I can... No, I can't latch on that way.
[191:19.22]We're going to go up and around.
[191:28.68]It's hard to latch onto that crappy wall.
[191:39.19]I don't have very much time.
[191:40.45]I'm running out of time.
[191:41.35]Here's the security room.
[191:51.54]I could blow up this wall a couple times.
[191:54.24]We're going to do that.
[192:05.93]Let's do it again.
[192:06.37]Actually, I'm going to blow this one up when this guy comes on his way back.
[192:10.59]So, right... No.
[192:19.52]Ah!
[192:19.96]I got one of them.
[192:23.76]Do I have another bomb?
[192:26.22]I do.
[192:26.51]I'm not going to waste it.
[192:31.53]This is fairly straightforward from here on out.
[192:37.90]And I can just do that.
[192:39.48]And I have a door protecting me as well.
[192:41.62]Isn't that something?
[192:48.00]Whoa!
[192:56.15]Wow, I did not know that was going to happen.
[192:58.67]I did not.
[193:00.57]I'm okay.
[193:01.61]Don't worry, I'll be fine.
[193:10.96]Why?
[193:13.06]Get me the fuck out of here.
[193:16.71]I'm buying the next level and I'm fucking going to bed.
[193:19.21]Give me a break.
[193:25.27]See, like, I'll tell you something about myself, right?
[193:27.80]Here's something about me.
[193:29.44]I cannot get killed by the very difficult thing that is hard to do.
[193:34.96]But once, like, the easiest shit in the game, I fuck it up.
[193:40.24]I walk into spikes, but you'll see me, like, quadruple a room.
[193:44.00]Like, the hard shit I do fine at.
[193:46.12]But the stuff, like, I just walk into spikes and shit.
[193:50.41]What's with that?
[193:56.51]Like, somebody else, like, play the game until you get to, like, the really hard part.
[194:00.07]I'll do that part.
[194:01.47]And then I'll just sit and watch while you do the easy parts.
[194:07.34]But let's buy that new area.
[194:11.58]Let's go take a look at the casino.
[194:16.06]You know what I think it really is?
[194:17.88]I think I just have absolutely no patience at all.
[194:21.49]So me having like zero patience is bad.
[194:25.07]Because I'm just like, I gotta fucking go right now.
[194:28.41]I don't want to sit here anymore.
[194:30.19]Now this is the casino.
[194:42.78]This is a brand new enemy.
[194:43.78]I don't know what the hell that guy does.
[194:45.19]There's shit on the ceiling now.
[194:47.21]There's like everlasting gobstoppers in these rooms now.
[194:49.61]That's great.
[194:52.25]I can't kill that, I don't think.
[194:54.75]Can I not hit him?
[194:55.90]I can.
[195:05.92]Whoa!
[195:08.07]Alright, I found out what that enemy does.
[195:10.90]They kill you if you touch them.
[195:13.00]Okay, good to know.
[195:15.20]I only got six days left.
[195:18.82]This is done.
[195:20.56]This is toast.
[195:21.80]I got to world three.
[195:23.88]This blinching shit.
[195:26.99]And they just drive at you and explode.
[195:30.71]Five days left.
[195:32.05]Let's just play it out.
[195:33.81]Fuck it.
[195:34.19]Let's just do it.
[195:34.79]Play it out.
[195:36.99]Let's go.
[195:38.29]I got five days left and I have three more worlds.
[195:40.95]You know what?
[195:42.01]I ain't gonna stop moving.
[195:49.75]Four days.
[195:50.69]We got it.
[195:51.03]We're gonna get it.
[195:51.45]We're gonna get all the money in four days.
[195:52.81]Here we go.
[195:54.13]You think I care?
[195:56.42]You think I give a shit?
[195:57.86]EMP rate!
[196:00.94]Let's go.
[196:02.26]Don't stop moving.
[196:02.82]I'm not gonna stop moving one time.
[196:07.63]Where am I?
[196:08.97]It's alright.
[196:09.35]Speedrun.
[196:11.13]That one didn't count.
[196:13.20]We're gonna get all the money on the last day.
[196:18.58]Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[196:21.06]I have three days to win the game.
[196:24.86]What's in the box?
[196:25.44]I don't know.
[196:26.34]This could just explode.
[196:27.34]I don't even know what it does.
[196:29.58]No, it has money.
[196:33.84]What the hell just happened?
[196:41.69]I don't know.
[196:42.21]All these enemies are new.
[196:43.71]I died though.
[196:44.61]Two days.
[196:48.35]I'll show you.
[196:49.05]I'll show you how it's done.
[196:49.81]I'll show you how to get everything in two days.
[196:55.36]See?
[196:56.04]I planned that.
[196:56.74]I don't even care.
[196:59.36]I turned off the machine.
[197:01.90]There's another one up here.
[197:04.26]There's like a... Look at this.
[197:05.32]There's like a fucking Frankenstein inside of a cube.
[197:07.50]Cool.
[197:08.72]Cool, let's go.
[197:09.28]I don't know if I can hurt him.
[197:16.92]I can't hurt that guy, I don't think.
[197:18.69]We got one day left.
[197:19.79]One day.
[197:21.17]Final day.
[197:24.47]Last day.
[197:26.11]This is the one.
[197:27.21]This is when we siphon 50 million dollars.
[197:31.18]What the hell is that?
[197:32.26]There's so many new enemies.
[197:33.32]Wow.
[197:40.47]Get it off, get all the money.
[197:45.87]Come on.
[197:53.30]Give me the money.
[197:54.68]Give it to me.
[197:59.00]Got it, let's go.
[198:09.73]Alright, well that's the stream.
[198:14.27]Yeah, thanks for coming.
[198:17.88]Take it easy.
[198:22.16]Can I even go anywhere?
[198:23.12]Uh-oh.
[198:26.91]It's gonna give me the you didn't do it screen.
[198:30.79]Am I gonna get... What's that thing?
[198:39.82]Hey, guys.
[198:41.48]Say what you want.
[198:43.78]This is one of the endings.
[198:45.63]I'm a completionist.
[198:47.61]I wanted to see all the endings.
[198:49.63]And this is one of them.
[198:51.59]I wanted to see all the endings.
[198:54.38]And I got to see it.
[198:55.00]Okay.
[199:02.00]Did it.
[199:04.37]Did it!
[199:06.59]The game has been done to completion, right?
[199:13.45]I'm at the credits.
[199:16.51]Nobody can tell me that I didn't get to the end of this game, right?
[199:28.38]Look at these deserved credits.
[199:30.74]This is a deserved ending credits scene.
[199:37.71]this music playing, I just want to say it was a tough run.
[199:43.63]But we held our heads high.
[199:45.85]And not for one second did we lose hope.
[199:48.95]Not for one minute of our lives did we think it was not possible.
[199:54.30]I beat the game.
[199:55.98]And all of you were here to help.
[199:58.04]Everybody in this chat, all of you.
[200:00.48]Thank you.
[200:02.24]Very much.
[200:03.56]For being here.
[200:12.68]Black screen.
[200:13.34]Okay.
[200:13.90]New game.
[200:14.54]Let's just... If you guys are curious, those of you that are wondering what's going on.
[200:20.58]So, I have... You have, I believe, what?
[200:25.00]80 days?
[200:28.92]You have 80 days to do this.
[200:31.72]You have to pretty much get 7 or 8... I'd say about a million dollars to pretty much beat the game.
[200:46.38]And every day is a new day, as you see.
[200:49.64]This is the final area, the Swindle.
[200:52.00]The game's namesake.
[200:53.34]It's a pretty cool game.
[200:54.55]It's pretty fun.
[200:56.53]If you're good at video games.
[200:59.45]And when you're not that good at video games, especially ones like this that require a lot of patience and a lot of thought and skill, you get to Casino Town and lose.
[201:11.03]But yeah, that's gonna be the stream, guys.
[201:14.17]I'm gonna go get some food.
[201:15.47]I'm kinda hungry.
[201:18.29]But I could play this game again, maybe.
[201:22.19]Wonderful that you're explaining the game now that you're done playing it.
[201:24.93]Yeah, that would have been good to do at the beginning, right?
[201:27.35]But that's what happens when you get a mystery game.
[201:30.03]It's a mystery.
[201:40.23]Alright.
[201:41.63]Ladies and gentlemen.
[201:44.53]I love you.
[201:46.49]I love you.
[201:46.95]All of you.
[201:49.34]Tell me you love me.
[201:53.47]It's 100 days.
[201:56.07]So I'll probably see you around.
[201:58.59]Maybe in the next couple days.
[201:59.61]I don't know.
[202:00.11]I'm going to be streaming Army Crog.
[202:02.37]Army Crog when it got delayed.
[202:06.06]They want to fix all the bugs and get rid of all the bad technical problems in the game apparently.
[202:13.91]But I'll be streaming that entire game.
[202:15.89]Start to finish.
[202:17.47]Comes out on the 30th.
[202:18.97]So, if I don't stream again until the 30th, at least know that I'll be streaming on the 30th.
[202:25.31]So, there you go.
[202:27.38]It won't be a full month.
[202:30.30]Anyways, guys.
[202:31.70]I will talk to you soon.
[202:34.92]Thank you for coming.
[202:36.50]Goodbye.
[202:37.14]Good night.
[202:38.42]Have a wonderful day.
