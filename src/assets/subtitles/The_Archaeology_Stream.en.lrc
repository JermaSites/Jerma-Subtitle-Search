[00:07.49]God.
[00:09.31]Fucking fire ants everywhere.
[00:12.45]I'm gonna die from fire ants.
[00:15.21]Where is the stupid treasure?
[00:18.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:20.92]What's that, what's that, what's that, what's that?
[00:25.52]Something, something, something, something, something.
[00:27.56]God damn it.
[00:42.78]This makes six hours.
[00:51.87]What is that?
[01:03.63]Nothing.
[01:12.97]Well, maybe, maybe you shouldn't have lost the map.
[01:15.95]That would have been really smart.
[01:21.16]Blew out of my fucking hands.
[01:23.26]Wild dogs and shit.
[01:27.14]What's that?
[01:30.61]I got something, got something.
[01:31.47]Wait, wait, hold on.
[01:32.39]Is it?
[01:42.23]I always knew.
[01:43.61]I always knew.
[01:44.09]Sometimes you just have to double check.
[01:54.01]What is that?
[01:59.87]That's the skull.
[02:02.61]That's the skull!
[02:03.47]Hey, I found the skull!
[02:06.47]That's the skull that was on the map.
[02:07.61]That's all I remember.
[02:08.27]That's the last thing I remember.
[02:16.81]Come on, come on.
[02:25.27]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:31.82]Something in here.
[02:32.80]Something in there.
[02:35.12]Something in there.
[02:43.60]Oh shit, what is this?
[02:49.98]This goes pretty deep, this goes pretty deep.
[02:55.05]What on Earth is this?
[02:58.59]What the fuck is that?
[03:01.35]What the fuck is this?
[03:04.55]This is huge, what is this?
[03:07.85]You guys see this?
[03:14.48]It's a very large rock in here.
[03:17.28]By the way, have you guys had water?
[03:21.95]In like a couple hours?
[03:24.89]You have?
[03:25.99]Alright, well share it.
[03:29.67]There we are.
[03:33.96]God, this is really in there.
[03:36.56]Whatever it is.
[03:40.84]Holy shit!
[03:42.26]I can't get it out, it's huge!
[03:46.50]Get outta here!
[03:48.29]Come on!
[03:51.17]Whoa!
[03:52.85]Don't wanna lose the hat!
[03:57.17]I didn't even say hello!
[03:58.39]How are ya?
[04:04.79]Fuckin' in here so bad!
[04:09.65]I'm going to tire myself out.
[04:13.87]This is definitely not a treasure.
[04:15.53]Come on.
[04:24.00]Get it open.
[04:25.72]Come on.
[04:30.56]There it is.
[04:32.38]Oh, shit.
[04:33.34]I think I broke the shovel.
[04:46.19]This was in the ground!
[04:50.37]This is really, really heavy.
[04:58.97]That's probably, that could be from an ancient civilization.
[05:05.34]Is that it?
[05:05.80]It can't be, hold on.
[05:07.92]Hold on a second.
[05:12.04]It's supposed to be cool, but it wasn't.
[05:19.92]What about over here?
[05:28.41]Sometimes you need a little bit of intuition.
[05:36.34]What's that?
[05:39.66]What's that?
[05:40.40]What's that?
[05:40.76]What's that?
[05:41.10]What's that?
[05:48.60]I promise I'm older than 12.
[05:55.81]Something else in here.
[06:06.25]What's that?
[06:17.52]There's more of this shit!
[06:24.43]Can you see this?
[06:26.19]Look it!
[06:26.53]Mom!
[06:29.58]Oh, you're not Mom.
[06:30.54]Look what's in the ground!
[06:33.26]What the heck are these?
[06:36.59]There's more, hold on, there's more in there.
[06:43.51]There are bees, okay?
[06:47.03]All comedy aside, there are bees, like, swarming.
[06:51.91]This is how it ends.
[06:55.21]They're like right in the eyes.
[06:56.70]Good thing I have glasses on.
[07:01.18]There's shit in the ground.
[07:03.14]Wait, hold on a minute.
[07:22.31]I need to take these glasses to the front of my face.
[07:28.52]I could have sworn I got a signal somewhere.
[07:37.72]Maybe in this vicinity here.
[07:39.62]Possible.
[07:46.95]I feel like Johnny is opening up.
[07:50.65]I just got out of the hospital.
[07:52.61]I have my back in my surgical gown.
[07:55.99]This is so tiring.
[07:58.73]You have no idea.
[08:03.55]What else is in here?
[08:09.46]What is this?
[08:12.12]I don't think this is a rock.
[08:14.92]Is it rock?
[08:19.41]It's probably from the fucking Mayan times.
[08:23.44]What is it?
[08:32.04]Holy shoot!
[08:42.67]More rocks!
[08:48.57]I don't know if I can do any more with the shovel.
[08:50.43]This is fucking tiring.
[08:53.32]That's a huge one.
[08:57.56]It's too tiring.
[08:59.04]It's too tiring.
[09:00.48]Give me one second.
[09:01.41]I'll be right back.
[09:33.60]Gotta get something bigger than a shovel.
[09:38.50]Fuck it.
[09:39.88]Get in here.
[09:44.32]Where's the... What happened to this?
[09:48.64]Get over here.
[09:58.81]Alright.
[10:00.23]Sometimes...
[10:02.76]You gotta come in with the big guns.
[10:07.44]It's in this area here.
[10:20.45]I'm gonna find that goddamn treasure and I'll be the first one.
[10:34.41]Sometimes holla takes its mind.
[10:49.38]Get a nice dig there, right up.
[10:51.94]Why would I have even used the shovel for any reason?
[11:02.77]Something right in there, something in there.
[11:04.67]There's something in there.
[11:12.94]What's that up?
[11:15.48]I wanna go backwards.
[11:26.99]Whoa, don't go that way.
[11:29.99]Something in there.
[11:33.44]Something in there.
[11:34.18]You see that?
[11:35.42]That was a shitload of rocks.
[11:38.34]This place has got all these rocks.
[11:47.80]Should I do a wheelie?
[11:49.58]Should I do a wheelie?
[11:57.47]Alright.
[12:00.31]Here we go.
[12:00.57]Let's go.
[12:05.79]Oh, I can't believe, Jeremiah, how do you know how to use that?
[12:08.05]But you don't think I fucking know everything?
[12:10.25]You don't think I know how to use one of these?
[12:12.13]I worked for 10 years in the industry.
[12:14.23]Give me a break.
[12:35.32]Alright, head down.
[12:37.22]I think there's something in here.
[12:49.71]There we go.
[12:50.47]Get in there.
[12:53.07]That felt pretty good.
[12:54.07]That felt pretty good.
[12:58.72]Felt pretty good.
[13:02.40]Hold on.
[13:03.18]Give me over here.
[13:09.69]Remember kids, only if you're a trained professional like I am.
[13:18.67]Come on right here.
[13:29.79]Come on right here.
[13:36.75]There are bees.
[13:37.57]There are bees and they're very angry.
[13:43.77]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[13:47.23]It's like the world shittiest Disney ride.
[13:53.21]I paid to rent one of these to just have a personal shitty Disney ride.
[14:08.48]I feel something solid.
[14:12.56]Something solid right over here.
[14:17.81]Shit.
[14:23.73]There's something solid right here.
[14:26.23]What is over there?
[14:27.70]I can't go down.
[14:28.22]There's something in there.
[14:30.16]Something in there.
[14:30.76]Hold on.
[14:35.12]What is here?
[14:37.34]Shit.
[14:49.52]the thread, and I almost got... Solid!
[15:06.37]Solid!
[15:09.23]Solid!
[15:12.11]No!
[15:13.67]What the...
[15:23.17]You see that?
[15:27.17]I knew I fucking felt something.
[15:28.33]Hold on.
[15:31.04]Holy shit.
[15:38.98]It's a chest.
[15:41.46]Oh, fuck.
[15:47.87]I broke it.
[15:49.75]It ripped off.
[15:51.59]I'll get it.
[15:52.01]I'll get it.
[15:52.39]I'll get it.
[15:55.31]You've got to be kidding me.
[15:56.19]This must be what was on the map.
[16:01.93]It's probably going to be filled with fucking dirt.
[16:09.82]Oh, my God.
[16:13.40]Oh, don't.
[16:14.42]There could be valuables in here.
[16:20.29]Ah.
[16:21.79]Ah.
[16:23.06]Come on.
[16:27.39]Oh, okay.
[16:29.49]Wow, what's up?
[16:34.39]Bounce.
[17:00.39]This is just a trap.
[17:02.69]One of those things that has stuff in it.
[17:05.47]This is just a full-on actual treasure chest.
[17:10.58]I got... I got rocks.
[17:14.28]Do we... ...or a scientist or something?
[17:22.61]Some kind of rock, a scientist.
[17:25.29]You can?
[17:27.19]Get somebody down here.
[17:28.91]I'm gonna get, there's a lot, there's some in here too.
[17:32.75]Give us one second.
[17:34.27]I wanna get this stuff ready to go.
[17:35.59]Can you get a guy?
[17:36.09]Alright, we'll be right back.
[17:38.20]Let's get this stuff ready.
[17:38.92]I wanna see what's in here.
[18:04.30]Thank you.
[19:59.68]Thank you.
[21:08.64]Thank you.
[22:08.83]Well.
[22:10.93]Well, well, well.
[22:12.57]Got everything situated.
[22:14.13]Got my glasses off so I can take a look inside and see what's in here.
[22:17.97]I don't know what's going to be in here, but I'm very curious.
[22:21.58]Let's find out.
[22:24.47]It's just like The Legend of Zelda.
[22:26.35]It should be like... Oh my god.
[22:35.85]There's a lot of shit in here.
[22:38.81]What is in here?
[22:41.81]Okay, there's a letter.
[22:44.49]This looks like a letter.
[22:45.23]What does it say?
[22:55.46]Dear beloved family, if you're reading this right now, I'm probably dead.
[23:02.10]Or you stole it from me, in which case I wanted that.
[23:05.52]But give it back if you took it, but if I'm dead, then you can keep it.
[23:08.65]But anyways, if you find this letter, you found my treasure chest, you found all of my goodies that I've been keeping for the last 30 to 40 years.
[23:19.14]There's some valuable stuff in here.
[23:21.34]And whoever found this, congratulations.
[23:24.36]You just went up a whole tax bracket.
[23:27.30]Absolutely no love to any of you.
[23:29.78]It's in my truest heart of hearts that I really hope that at least some of you die trying to get this.
[23:35.30]I mean, killing each other.
[23:36.98]I really hope that ten of you fucking got here and had chainsaws and firearms and are killing each other over this.
[23:43.60]And if I had to make any bets at all, it would be Danny.
[23:46.94]I bet you Danny's the one holding this treasure chest right now.
[23:50.50]And if I'm wrong, who cares?
[23:52.44]I'm dead.
[23:53.72]So all in all, have a wonderful rest of your life with your new found fortune, Grandpa.
[24:04.72]What a fucking maniac.
[24:09.38]Well, it wasn't Danny.
[24:13.76]What happened to him?
[24:19.60]anyways uh interesting grandpa I guess that thank you we found it now what's in here though I saw some I got a good look let's see it looks like we have various um snack items dunkaroos there's like a time capsule I don't capri suns kinder joys 3d doritos

[24:52.82]I mean, in the 90s, maybe this would have been alright.
[24:57.08]This would have been cool, maybe you thought.
[24:59.12]But a bunch of people complained on Twitter.
[25:01.39]And all this shit came back.
[25:05.59]Like, I think this is, can't you just buy this?
[25:09.19]Can't you buy Surge?
[25:11.63]And why would you put this many Capri Suns in here?

[26:57.59]I have heard that Pokémon cards go for a shitload of money.
[27:01.29]I've seen people... If that's what's in there, that has to be what's in there.
[27:06.37]1997.
[27:07.27]That's a booster pack in there.

[30:16.36]No, it's flying off the table, these are worth money.
[30:19.14]These might be worth money.
[30:21.26]That's gonna get lost in the park.
[30:28.00]Where'd it go?
[30:38.94]You think I'm gonna lose the Razzlepussy, you out of your mind?
[30:45.70]That's what the bag is for?
[30:46.66]Oh.

[31:30.56]Oh, that must be a common.
[31:33.44]Zap bit?
[31:38.27]Right now, a bunch of people just said, don't touch him.
[31:42.86]It's alright.
[31:43.26]It's just fucking Grotto Beasts.
[31:44.54]What do you care?
[31:46.68]Peep.
[31:47.00]I like Peep Peep.
[31:47.82]Peep Peep's really cool.
[31:48.56]What's his damage?
[31:49.90]Heals all allies one HP at the beginning of each turn.
[31:54.04]Is that good?
[31:56.90]An anti-bite.
[31:59.68]Swipe attack up to three to... This is kind of cool.
[32:05.13]Oh, god damn it.
[32:08.65]That, whoa, whoa, whoa, foil, foil, foil, foil alert.
[32:14.17]Foil alert.
[32:16.43]That's a foil bag ghost.
[32:19.47]You gotta be kidding me.
[32:22.43]Wow, this is really cool.
[32:25.85]Hey, this company doesn't exist anymore, right?
[32:32.60]You can look into it.
[32:34.38]I remember there was one season on TV show, right?
[32:37.59]Something like that.
[32:39.33]Maybe.
[32:40.16]Find out how much this company's worth.
[32:42.96]Alright.
[32:43.36]If it even is still for sale or anything.
[32:45.94]You get back to me with a price.
[32:46.88]I'm curious.
[32:47.28]OK.
[32:48.46]Dust bunny?
[32:49.08]You see dust bunny?
[32:53.02]There you are.
[32:55.38]I love dust bunny.
[32:59.40]OK.
[33:00.12]OK.
[33:00.88]OK.
[33:01.72]Alright.
[33:03.38]Alright.
[33:04.72]This is a holographic sludge.
[33:07.74]I don't, okay, I don't, should I not, don't touch it.
[33:09.54]Just leave it here.
[33:10.94]I'm not going to touch that.
[33:13.07]This is my favorite character already.
[33:14.47]I don't even know what it is, but I love it.
[33:17.21]That's a holographic foil sludge.
[33:20.95]Can you get me something where I can actually put this down on?
[33:24.45]Yeah, sure.
[33:25.13]Give me the thing that they put them in.
[33:28.10]Like a napkin.
[33:29.00]Do you have any napkins?
[33:31.84]I shouldn't be touching this like this.
[33:33.16]I should have my gloves on.
[33:35.68]A napkin.
[33:37.42]Like a white napkin.
[33:39.06]Any napkin.
[33:40.08]Hurry the fuck up.
[33:42.04]God damn it.
[33:48.90]I got to seal it, man.
[33:51.90]I don't want to touch it.
[33:55.63]Like that, because then it's protected.
[33:56.83]It might be worth them.
[33:57.97]I don't know.
[33:58.77]Who knows?
[33:59.15]I'm going to put this back in the worthless chest of nothing.
[34:03.43]Shh.
[34:08.94]These are like going in the dirt.
[34:10.40]People are probably having a panic attack right now.
[34:14.81]They're going in the sand.
[34:18.11]I keep forgetting to put them down.
[34:19.87]Did I lose the holographic sludge?
[34:22.31]Did I lose the holographic sludge?
[34:25.39]I don't see it here.
[34:27.79]Is it in the box?
[34:29.12]No.
[34:30.06]Where'd it go?
[34:34.98]It actually blew away.
[34:39.54]I have to find that.
[34:40.94]It's not in my hand, right?
[34:42.32]No.
[34:44.60]Somebody actually go look for that.
[34:45.82]Like, I'm serious.
[34:46.36]Yeah, okay.
[34:48.12]Because I actually want that one.
[34:49.48]That's not a part of this joke or anything.
[34:51.28]I want that card.
[34:57.09]I'm just going to look for it.
[35:07.59]Is it not even here?
[35:10.34]Did it go over the... Alright, well... Well, that's okay.
[35:18.38]Well, let's open another couple.

[36:09.79]I put it in the box.
[36:10.91]I put it in the box.
[36:12.97]What are you guys saying?
[36:15.47]Zilly Wonka?
[36:20.81]It's in the chest.
[36:21.45]It's in the chest.
[36:23.93]You're a dumbass.
[36:34.56]Whatever.
[36:35.74]We're gonna keep going.
[36:40.94]Put this in here.
[36:42.80]Put it over here.
[36:47.53]Here we are.
[36:51.99]Y'all, that's already a festive mimic with a gold foil on it, and I don't even know what that means.
[36:57.09]Oh my god!
[36:58.25]They keep...
[37:05.32]Am I going to have to get a drill out here and start pinning this stuff down?
[37:09.00]No, that's... Don't ever open up card packs on a windy day.
[37:20.72]This is what you all wanted to see.
[37:22.74]This is what you wanted to see.
[37:25.27]This is what you wanted.
[37:28.49]Best of mimic.
[37:29.63]I'm going to hold on to that one.
[37:30.83]Here's the thing about doing this.
[37:34.71]What else can I possibly say about what I'm doing right now?
[37:38.73]You know what I mean?
[37:39.37]What else could I even possibly say?
[37:41.29]We found the company.
[37:43.23]You found the company?
[37:44.17]You can buy it.
[37:45.16]How much is it worth?
[37:46.22]Like $350,000.
[37:48.58]It's $350,000 for the... It's GrottoBeast.com is what we found.

[38:18.77]Holy shit!
[38:22.65]That's a lizard wizard?
[38:27.03]This one's got really good speed.
[38:29.96]Alright, let's do this the right way.
[38:32.60]Oh, wow.

[38:41.90]Optimal Illusion.
[38:42.60]What's he got?
[38:43.80]Summon two 0-0 illusions with Taunt.
[38:46.80]Grand finale.
[38:47.48]After reaching below 2 HP, Optimal Illusion puts on a grand display, stunning all enemies for one round.
[38:55.08]I like this.
[38:55.60]This is fucking cool.
[38:58.74]Did you get it?
[39:00.19]Did you buy it?
[39:02.22]It was that easy.
[39:03.50]Well, I mean, I left a voicemail.
[39:05.66]You're probably the only person that left a voicemail at that company's voicemail in the last 25 years, so that's fine.
[39:09.90]At least the number was still connected.
[39:11.50]That's cool.
[39:11.80]Alright, good.
[39:12.34]You said grottobeast.com?
[39:14.33]Yeah.
[39:14.53]Alright.
[39:18.53]Baroot.
[39:21.29]Baroot's cool.

[39:26.29]Oh, this is the... I love Jukeboxer.
[39:31.23]This is awesome.
[39:33.87]And look at this one.
[39:34.97]I love the festive mimic.
[39:37.69]That's unbelievable.
[39:40.67]How many more packs do I have?
[39:44.79]I'll do this for the rest of the damn stream.
[39:46.37]I don't care.
[39:46.87]And we got a shitload.
[39:49.53]Hey, did you get a hold of a scientist?
[39:53.82]You got somebody, right?
[39:54.50]Okay.
[39:55.18]Because we have, there's rocks that I've never seen before.
[39:58.46]So, I definitely don't want to see what the deal is with those.
[40:03.10]This is now a card pack opening stream.
[40:16.54]What's the other one got here?
[40:17.34]Ooh, that's a bobbin.
[40:19.34]This is a common bobbin.
[40:23.38]That's a general festive mimic.
[40:25.14]I'm starting to understand their names.
[40:28.09]That's a general porcelain.
[40:29.25]We saw that already.
[40:29.93]We saw that.
[40:30.37]These are some repeats.
[40:31.43]Toy Rex.
[40:33.63]We're waiting for the foil.
[40:36.03]Toy Rex.
[40:38.75]Sneezy.
[40:40.55]Sneezy sneezes.
[40:41.55]There's a booger on that one.
[40:48.52]There's a piece of food on that one.
[40:52.74]Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
[41:01.11]Oh chroma nova!
[41:03.53]Oh what the- no! No!
[41:10.29]No! No! No!
[41:14.30]Relax.
[41:20.64]What's he got for attack?
[41:23.32]Well, this will actually, holy shit, eight, seven, seven, eight, seven, seven, nine, magic?
[41:28.26]This is the strongest card we've found so far, and it's gold foil.
[41:35.68]Alright, put that one in the box, because that one's probably worth something.
[41:38.15]We have to go through the unpretty emotions about our faces.
[41:40.11]That's probably worth something, right?
[41:42.19]We got a common meowdy.
[41:46.05]Oh, there's more, there's more.
[41:49.19]A storm flatty.

[46:12.07]I have to ask very honest questions.
[46:15.62]People open like a hundred of these?
[46:20.76]I ran out of stuff to say like 15 minutes ago.

[47:19.04]I wonder what he's talking about.
[47:19.96]Let's get that open.
[47:29.33]What was it?
[47:31.27]Oh, are we... People want to invest.
[47:33.87]You want to invest?
[47:35.97]I have a chat over here, I have to walk.
[47:41.29]I would die for Proto Jammer.
[47:46.55]Grotto Beasts Tournament incoming.
[47:51.96]God damn, we're gonna clean all this up.
[48:01.47]They're not going far, they're just going like right here.

[49:32.58]I'm putting all the... They're all going in here.
[49:34.40]Don't worry.
[49:36.00]I'm a litterer.
[49:36.86]Fuck that.
[49:37.27]I ain't got a litter.
[49:44.89]Don't do that shit.
[49:45.99]Pick up after yourself.

[49:53.94]Dragosome.
[49:56.80]An antebite.
[49:59.65]Oh, Proto Jammer!
[50:00.55]Somebody said that they would die for this guy.
[50:01.89]I don't know who you are, but it's pretty cool.
[50:07.54]It's a really cool card.
[50:10.90]Holographic Stormflatty.
[50:16.80]A Dragosome, a Toy Rex.
[50:21.06]And a Holographic Sir Greaves.
[50:27.91]Excellent!
[50:30.57]Alright.
[50:33.35]Coming up next.
[50:34.85]That's all the card packs.
[50:36.31]Thank you, Grandpa, for your worthless chest.
[50:38.73]But still, that was kind of a cool, that's a cool thing.
[50:41.49]And I'll own that company.
[50:43.61]Uh, there's other, uh, I don't know, whatever.
[50:49.14]Uh, we got a bunch of rock.
[50:50.10]Did you see these?
[50:50.66]Look up here.
[50:52.48]These came out of the ground.
[50:55.36]I, I really, do we, do we have, do we have any ETA on the, uh, on the scientists?
[51:02.78]There could be stuff inside of these.
[51:05.00]I have no idea.
[51:07.36]Why don't we break them open?
[51:09.56]Sound like a good idea?
[51:10.76]You want to crush them?
[51:11.44]Yeah.
[51:12.98]Alright, let's get that set up.
[51:14.14]Let's crush a bunch of geodes.
[51:17.55]Get a scientist.
[51:18.85]We'll be right back.
[51:20.77]After this short... Just cut it before I look like an idiot.
[51:28.05]Okay.
[52:03.94]Bye.
[52:51.33]Bye.
[54:00.06]Thank you.
[54:47.89]Thank you.
[56:43.46]So, hello there, welcome back.
[56:45.89]As you see, we have our beautiful geodes on the table.
[56:48.41]And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[56:52.77]Josh, good to see you.
[56:53.89]By the way, I want to make this really clear, not an actor.
[56:57.31]This is not like an actor.
[56:58.91]This is a scientist.
[56:59.95]This is a real scientist from ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[57:04.46]Versus important, very important.
[57:05.72]I want to make this really clear.
[57:07.06]Everybody on site here has been tested for COVID within the last 24 hours.
[57:10.57]All negative.
[57:11.41]Very important.
[57:12.03]That's why we're still trying to be a little socially distant and everything.
[57:15.25]But everyone on site here has been tested for COVID negative in the last 24 hours.
[57:19.33]Very important.
[57:20.33]So I guess as an archaeologist, you could probably give us... Wait, wait, wait.
[57:27.22]This isn't archaeology.
[57:28.76]It's not?
[57:29.36]No, we're dealing with rocks.
[57:31.70]Oh, okay.
[57:32.26]Archaeology people stuff.
[57:33.93]Archaeology stuff, that's geology.
[57:36.35]So this is not archaeology?
[57:38.89]Not at all.
[57:40.77]The title of the stream is The Wonders of Archaeology, and we have t-shirts that are being printed that are archaeology t-shirts.
[57:51.66]You might have to cancel those, and thanks a lot for that.
[57:55.69]Not archaeology!
[57:56.49]Alright, that's a common misconception, right?
[57:58.69]Yeah, I would say so.
[57:59.76]So, we're gonna break these open.
[58:03.24]Welcome to the stream, I hope you enjoyed the intros.
[58:06.40]So, each one of these, hopefully, has something interesting in the middle.
[58:11.26]Let's find out.
[58:12.12]And over here, we got one here, over here.
[58:14.49]Let's get our safety protection eye gear.
[58:16.99]Over here we have a device.
[58:19.79]Now, this device is designed
[58:24.31]to open these.
[58:26.89]I think its original purpose is to cut pipes.
[58:30.73]I think so, yeah.
[58:31.35]That's what I'm understanding.
[58:32.70]So how this works, we're going to be very careful.
[58:34.82]We've been trained, sort of, in how to use it.
[58:39.94]So we're going to try to open as much of these as we can and see what we get.
[58:43.44]Eye protection gear, safety is number one importance.
[58:46.84]Let's get it open and see if we can get one to work.
[58:49.24]We have tested it.
[58:51.35]and we got it to work but let's a live TV right let's see what we can get so the idea is you put the rock right in the middle and you wrap it the chain around so it's taught right down the middle looks like it's down the middle right yep and if we can go like this get it in there like that so now let's see if we can get this to break
[59:21.09]Are we ready to try our first rock?
[59:24.01]Are we good?
[59:26.02]Let's see what happens.
[59:27.84]Here we go.
[59:29.68]It's time to break the first rock.
[59:35.32]Did I got it?
[59:35.74]Can we check it?
[59:38.27]I think we got it.
[59:39.85]We got it.
[59:40.21]Oh my god, that looks awesome.
[59:46.91]So what is going on in here?
[59:48.32]So what we have here is a geode.
[59:50.04]And so if you get up close there, in the space inside the hollow, those are quartz crystals.
[59:56.82]And so each of these are individual quartz crystals growing in there.
[59:59.81]Oh my God.
[60:00.57]Can I see one of the halves of these?
[60:02.25]I want to get this onto the other camera.
[60:04.15]So this is quartz?
[60:05.27]Quartz, yes.
[60:07.71]Can we see under here?
[60:11.31]Under this little guy here?
[60:15.48]So this one, this like isn't as hollow as some of them.
[60:17.88]Is there a reason why they're not as hollow?
[60:20.18]Each one of them forms as an air bubble in a lava flow.
[60:23.00]And so depending on how much time there's been for water to pass through these voids, the minerals get bigger and bigger and fill in the hole.
[60:29.50]Oh, alright.
[60:30.54]This one looks like it's been in a taffy.
[60:33.84]And I know I've seen the comments that I'm just like a little terrible version of him.
[60:38.20]Look at me.
[60:41.38]This is the real deal here, okay?
[60:42.42]We need to keep that really clear.
[60:45.03]Alright, so it worked!
[60:46.25]It worked!
[60:47.31]Hooray!
[60:48.11]We were terrified that it wasn't going to work.
[60:51.31]So which one should we do next, what do you think?
[60:53.46]Let's pick a random one.
[60:54.34]Just pick a random one?
[60:54.92]Alright, let's go for it, let's do it again.
[61:01.14]Let's get the chain up.
[61:02.04]We need to have the lever up.
[61:05.22]So this one's a little bigger, let's see how this one is.
[61:11.27]Like right there maybe?
[61:13.05]Yeah, here we go.
[61:14.46]Get it right in the middle.
[61:18.26]Alright, that looks good.
[61:19.16]Alright.
[61:20.28]You ready?
[61:21.94]This one's a little bigger.
[61:23.34]Here we go.
[61:28.67]This one's tough.
[61:31.25]Come on.
[61:32.69]Got it.
[61:34.85]Oh, that's all.
[61:35.89]Oh, whoa.
[61:37.43]Holy cow.
[61:41.13]So those are really clear quartz crystals, which tells us that that's a really pure mineral.
[61:45.67]So that's why you're getting kind of that glassy appearance of them.
[61:48.09]That looks incredible.
[61:49.11]Let's carefully get this out of here.
[61:53.19]Oh, wow.
[61:53.67]That looks like the inside of a cave.
[61:55.53]This looks like a cave.
[61:56.27]It's kind of like a mini cave, yeah.
[62:00.79]You go under here.
[62:04.67]That one looks really good.
[62:05.41]Let me see that one.
[62:06.05]This one looks awesome.
[62:06.85]There's like caverns in this one.
[62:09.75]You get a good view?
[62:12.93]Look at those crystals.
[62:15.71]I have no idea what's going to happen with one of these huge ones.
[62:19.43]This is really pretty.
[62:20.15]It's awesome.
[62:20.69]Quartz is actually one of the most common minerals on the planet, so these are some really pretty examples of them.
[62:25.87]Alright, let's grab this guy here.
[62:27.30]Ooh, something rattling in there.
[62:30.86]Something's rattling around.
[62:31.96]Can you hear that?
[62:33.54]Can you pick that up?
[62:35.48]Yeah, we got it.
[62:38.20]Cool.
[62:38.62]There's something.
[62:39.02]Okay, what is in here?
[62:42.24]There's only one way to find out, that's right.
[62:44.88]Want to give me a hand and hold this up for me?
[62:46.58]Thank you.
[62:49.28]There's something shaking around in here.
[62:53.82]What if it's like a bunch of snakes just came up?
[63:01.35]Maybe one more?
[63:01.91]Right there.
[63:05.41]Almost got it.
[63:06.05]Let's see if that does it.
[63:09.22]It's right in the middle, right?
[63:10.10]Looks good.
[63:11.31]Alright, you ready to go?
[63:14.93]Here we go!
[63:17.91]Three, two, one, get it!
[63:25.15]What?!
[63:25.45]It's like a bowl!
[63:28.33]Cool.
[63:28.83]Oh my god!
[63:30.85]So why is this one like that?
[63:33.06]So the small minerals are in there because this one just hasn't had as much exposure to groundwater to build the big minerals.
[63:39.62]And another interesting thing about this one is that this isn't just pure quartz this time.
[63:44.98]I don't know how easy it is to see where you're at, but they're actually kind of purplish.
[63:48.80]And so this is a variety of quartz called amethyst.
[63:51.37]Oh, this is amethyst.
[63:52.21]Alright, cool.
[63:53.05]That's awesome.
[63:54.43]So wait, quartz is amethyst?
[63:55.99]Yep, amethyst is a variety of quartz that has a little bit of iron in it.
[63:59.15]You just learned something right here.
[64:00.75]Let's get a good look.
[64:07.16]This looks like almost like an ashtray.
[64:08.66]That's what it looks like.
[64:11.06]Like somebody just like flicking cigarettes in here.
[64:15.02]That one, this one's awesome.
[64:16.02]I love this one.
[64:16.56]Cool, yeah.
[64:18.12]Alright, should we do, let's do a couple, I'm trying to hold, this is like the ultimate stalling.
[64:23.19]Wait, what are these over here?
[64:25.89]What are those, what do you mean?
[64:26.85]Have you taken a look at these over here?
[64:29.05]No, what is it?
[64:30.99]You can just have it, I don't care.
[64:32.73]I don't know what it is.
[64:33.69]Alright.
[64:35.07]I don't know what it is, you can just have it.
[64:37.31]Let's do this one.
[64:39.81]Yeah, is this some rock you can just take?
[64:41.23]I don't care.
[64:41.55]Thank you.
[64:43.89]Yeah, no problem.
[64:46.86]Let's get this one.
[64:47.34]This one has like outside colors.
[64:50.52]Is there a reason why this one has like purple?
[64:52.60]Because these are lava flows.
[64:54.00]There's probably a microscopic mineral in there called orthoclase.
[64:57.94]Orthoclase.
[64:59.76]Sounds like a prescription drug.
[65:02.76]We're talking comedy and education.
[65:08.40]Let's get it in there.
[65:09.10]This is what happens when you bring scientists on set.
[65:12.38]No, this is awesome.
[65:14.48]I didn't think you were going to learn anything today.
[65:16.73]It's a weekend.
[65:17.45]I don't think you're going to learn anything on the weekend.
[65:19.53]Would you want to do the honors?
[65:20.46]Oh, go right ahead.
[65:21.24]I'll do the next one.
[65:21.98]How about that?
[65:22.32]Alright, cool.
[65:22.86]Alright, here we go.
[65:24.54]Ready?
[65:27.04]Maybe one more.
[65:29.26]One more rung.
[65:30.74]It's not getting the tautness.
[65:34.23]Up here.
[65:36.25]Like there.
[65:37.61]So maybe stick it in here.
[65:42.11]There we go.
[65:43.91]That should do it.
[65:46.69]Get in there.
[65:47.65]Get in there.
[65:50.71]Get it.
[65:52.15]Get it.
[65:54.47]It's an awkward shape.
[65:55.31]Alright, here we go.
[65:56.95]Ready?
[65:58.82]Let's see what's in the purple lava rock.
[66:04.78]There it is.
[66:07.18]Carefully lift it out.
[66:08.36]Did it get it?
[66:08.84]Yep.
[66:10.98]What's that?
[66:12.12]Oh, wow.
[66:15.15]So this one's like, this is black in there?
[66:19.40]Yeah, so that's a lot of the original lava rock.
[66:21.62]So there's a couple different types of lavas in here.
[66:23.24]There's the pink stuff, which is called rhyolite, and then there's the blackish stuff, which is more just your typical lava rock you'd have in a barbecue or something.
[66:31.20]Then instead of quartz, this time we have, it looks like calcite blades.
[66:35.00]Yeah, these are like flakes, looks like salt flakes.
[66:39.21]Hey, hey, chat, do you guys want to get a closer look?
[66:44.21]You guys want to get a closer look?
[66:46.71]I can barely even see that.
[66:49.15]Yeah, it looks like salt.
[66:50.35]Like salt flakes.
[66:53.25]This is so cool.
[66:54.17]So it's a different type of water that's going through this one versus the ones that we've already opened up.
[66:58.03]Oh, okay.
[66:58.37]So when you mean different types of water, do you mean like with different minerals in the water?
[67:02.42]Exactly.
[67:02.86]So different dissolved minerals as the water's coming through.
[67:06.70]That's so cool.
[67:08.66]Science.
[67:09.42]Support your local science projects and your local science organizations.
[67:14.41]Come on, look at this.
[67:16.41]How about, let's do, how about this?
[67:22.10]We'll do another big one.
[67:24.02]This one is meaty and this one's heavy too.
[67:25.82]And you mentioned that the heavier the rock, it's kind of the more that could be inside of it, right?
[67:30.46]More minerals that have grown in it, yeah.
[67:33.64]I'm like so excited.
[67:34.82]There's still so many to do and I love this.
[67:37.28]Let's go right down the middle here.
[67:47.28]get it on there that looks pretty good mm-hmm alright you ready three two one oh this one's tough
[68:09.54]There you go.
[68:10.22]Oh, alright.
[68:10.98]So this one is pretty pure quartz, but it does have a little purplish tint to it.
[68:16.46]Yeah, this one.
[68:17.44]So this would be more amethyst, right?
[68:19.15]Yeah.
[68:19.49]This one looks almost like the really hollow one.
[68:22.03]Probably from the same family.
[68:24.45]Same place, probably, yeah.
[68:25.49]Probably from the same exact mine, right?
[68:28.37]Because they pull these out of a mine.
[68:29.77]Yep.
[68:31.35]Cool.
[68:34.98]Cool.
[68:37.42]I don't think that's...
[68:39.28]what what are you you're not supposed to eat rocks why not I do it all the time alright what about um this one's bumpy this one's bumpy we'll try this one I'll try to save that one for later
[69:08.51]This one's got bumps.
[69:15.32]So is there a reason why this is bumpy on the outside?
[69:17.64]It's just a reflection of how they probably mined it out of the lava flow.
[69:20.84]Cool.
[69:21.76]I'm at the center.
[69:27.52]Alright, ready?
[69:29.80]Three, two, one, let's go.
[69:37.58]Whoa!
[69:37.88]Ooh, that's a pretty one.
[69:40.38]That's a really pretty one.
[69:43.63]It's kind of wedged in there.
[69:45.93]Wow.
[69:47.17]That looks unbelievable.
[69:48.61]So I think what we're looking at here is quartz again, but because it's kind of that grayish color, that's a variety called smoky quartz.
[69:56.57]What causes the smoky color in the quartz, the grayish color, is aluminum rather than the ironlets and the amethyst.
[70:02.53]This one looks awesome.
[70:04.09]It almost looks like it's dark, too.
[70:08.85]So you said quartz is the most common mineral in the world?
[70:11.88]On the surface of the planet, yep.
[70:14.44]Well, it sure does look pretty darn pretty.
[70:17.74]Let's do this one.
[70:19.44]Okay.
[70:20.22]Get it in there.
[70:23.12]This one's big.
[70:27.48]Alright, let's go for this.
[70:29.30]This one looks weird.
[70:30.54]Why does this one look so interesting?
[70:32.34]I don't know.
[70:32.72]This is unlike the other ones we've seen.
[70:35.10]It's really smooth.
[70:36.22]This one's really smooth.
[70:36.94]It's got a lot of dirt on it.
[70:41.02]I've never seen one like that before.
[70:42.22]Yeah, I know.
[70:42.78]This is really interesting.
[70:43.82]You ready?
[70:46.44]One, two, three.
[70:54.17]What's in there?
[70:56.15]I'm not sure.
[71:01.17]Oh my god!
[71:03.45]It's Minecraft diamonds!
[71:07.29]Wow!
[71:09.05]I can't believe it.
[71:10.41]It's even in a very cool packaging.
[71:13.18]It's even inside of a little bubble.
[71:17.42]That must be an air bubble.
[71:19.04]I'm going to defer to you on this one.
[71:21.62]The water must have flowed over the air and created an air bubble inside of this rock, a diamond rock.
[71:29.40]Wow!
[71:32.83]You see it?
[71:33.85]Get a closer look.
[71:36.56]Actually, this is really cool.
[71:37.44]It's like a cloth.
[71:42.20]Well, that's a new one for me.
[71:44.06]You've never seen a Minecraft diamond?
[71:45.30]No, that's a first.
[71:46.38]Can you get a good look?
[71:48.14]Here it is.
[71:50.55]Preserved forever.
[71:55.03]Okay.
[71:56.57]Very cool.
[71:57.39]Alright.
[72:00.21]What about this?
[72:00.93]This guy is already kind of...
[72:03.33]He's kind of already got a little... It's begging for it.
[72:06.21]Yeah, it's ready.
[72:08.67]Can you get a look at that?
[72:09.33]See that?
[72:11.47]This one is like already down the middle.
[72:14.89]So that's where we're going to do it.
[72:19.91]I can't believe we found Minecraft diamonds.
[72:22.31]I can't either.
[72:22.85]Alright, let's get it in there.
[72:31.97]Alright, and on the count of three, I want you to say, one, two, three, science!
[72:35.89]One, two, three!
[72:36.84]Science!
[72:39.90]You guys are fucking clowns.
[72:43.04]Oh, wait, hold on.
[72:46.40]It needs to be tighter.
[72:51.34]So you run an organization.
[72:53.40]I do, the Nevada Science Center in downtown Henderson, Nevada.
[72:57.86]And he was there.
[72:59.14]Two of them were very nice enough to come down here and help us do all this.
[73:03.36]So support your local science centers, especially this one.
[73:07.78]You ready?
[73:09.57]Three, two, one.
[73:11.05]Science.
[73:13.47]I didn't tell you to say it that time.
[73:15.29]Still not tight enough.
[73:16.85]Maybe a little bit tighter.
[73:18.77]Might have to go, like, hold on, let's go.
[73:22.48]Science.
[73:25.00]There we are.
[73:28.33]Let me change it up to this way.
[73:30.69]It's a little bumpy, so it has to be... It has to get really taut.
[73:37.05]That's taut.
[73:37.65]Alright, that'll do it.
[73:38.25]There you go.
[73:39.39]That'll do it.
[73:42.24]Okay, one, two, three, science!
[73:43.82]Hey, one, two, three!
[73:45.00]Science.
[73:45.78]Thank you.
[73:46.66]Excellent.
[73:54.15]There it goes.
[74:00.01]More quartz?
[74:00.77]Really pretty quartz one.
[74:03.51]Oh wow, this is deep.
[74:05.51]Yeah, it's got a really deep cavity in there.
[74:09.67]And check this one out, if you look down in there you can see some nice crystals too.
[74:12.79]Oh wow, it's like buried in there.
[74:16.24]How does this even, my world is so bizarre.
[74:19.10]How does this even happen?
[74:21.05]It's just when lava flow is making its way across the landscape, there's bubbles of gas in there.
[74:26.19]And so when the lava flow freezes into a rock, the air bubbles to get stuck in there, too.
[74:31.22]We have such a bizarre planet.
[74:32.64]Like, how would Doritos even be?
[74:34.44]Like, it's just insane to me.
[74:36.04]Some questions you better not answer.
[74:38.80]Let's do a big one.
[74:40.12]I think it's time for a big one.
[74:41.50]We're like, do a big one.
[74:43.12]We got three.
[74:43.70]We have two huge ones.
[74:45.56]Let's do a big one.
[74:47.46]So originally, we thought these may have been concrete.
[74:51.26]But they are not.
[74:52.24]It has been confirmed that this is real.
[74:53.94]It is real.
[74:55.22]And can you explain why it's real?
[74:57.34]If you look closely, you can actually see the air pockets that were around the main geode.
[75:01.14]And so that just shows that there was lots of gas in this lava flow.
[75:04.51]And the geodes just happen to be the biggest air voids that were in the rock.
[75:10.77]So we should probably do it if we can this way, right?
[75:14.07]We've got enough chain.
[75:14.73]Let's do it.
[75:15.29]Let's see if we can do it.
[75:17.90]My, like, $12 costume is starting to undo from the back.
[75:22.17]Alright, let's see.
[75:25.49]Right down the middle here.
[75:26.33]Do you hold the rock?
[75:30.35]Yeah, maybe hold the rock a little.
[75:32.39]And then... Thank you.
[75:36.99]It's a little embarrassing.
[75:38.03]Is it embarrassing?
[75:38.61]Yeah, a little bit.
[75:39.29]Is it actually embarrassing?
[75:40.05]No, it's... Oh, okay.
[75:41.03]Alright, I think we got it in a good spot.
[75:44.15]This is one of the big ones.
[75:45.01]This is the big ticket item right here.
[75:46.47]Are you ready?
[75:48.37]Let's see if I can do this with my measly worm arms.
[75:52.76]Here we go.
[75:57.76]Let's see if I can get it to break.
[75:58.78]It's going.
[76:01.10]It's going?
[76:01.50]Do it!
[76:11.91]It popped.
[76:13.97]Oh my god.
[76:16.53]I think your guests are in for a treat.
[76:18.35]That looks insane from back here.
[76:20.51]Let's go ahead and hold the rock.
[76:22.91]Got it.
[76:23.57]Let's lift this out.
[76:24.45]Careful.
[76:24.91]There we go.
[76:27.41]Oh my god.
[76:29.51]Wow.
[76:30.91]That's a beautiful amethyst geode.
[76:35.21]Look at all this in here.
[76:36.65]It's like a brain.
[76:37.49]It looks like the inside of somebody's head.
[76:41.21]And you can see here there's a, it kind of goes from kind of a solid color to kind of a clearish to the purple.
[76:48.08]That's the fluids through time changing as the crystals were growing in this space.
[76:53.65]Wow.
[76:54.85]So what's going on down here, like kind of that gray?
[76:58.29]Like this stuff?
[76:59.73]These are secondary minerals.
[77:01.42]And so these were the first minerals to grow.
[77:03.32]And then there was obviously a second, or not obviously, but I should say there was a second phase of minerals growing.
[77:08.56]That's what these other ones are.
[77:09.44]It's like a membrane.
[77:11.16]This is insane.
[77:12.48]That's alright.
[77:13.34]This is like, hold on to this one.
[77:16.46]Let's see.
[77:16.70]I want to get, see if we can get this over here.
[77:23.52]Can we get like a good, can we get in there?
[77:26.06]See what's in there?
[77:28.92]That looks awesome.
[77:29.90]It's an awesome purple, too.
[77:30.92]Look at these.
[77:31.80]Yeah, that's brilliant.
[77:35.48]It's like a shark fin.
[77:39.87]Well, that was worth it.
[77:40.89]That was absolutely worth it.
[77:43.63]That was awesome.
[77:44.25]Alright, should we do... I know this is going to be last, but, like, my God, it's huge.
[77:53.88]Let's get a couple here.
[77:55.44]We have, like, seven or eight more after this.
[77:59.72]Alright, we're going to do rapid fire and see if we can get a couple.
[78:09.30]So what does your organization do?
[78:11.63]So we are a research institution.
[78:13.91]So we'd go do geology, paleontology around the state of Nevada.
[78:17.44]And we also do lots of educational outreach.
[78:20.38]So right now with COVID, we're doing lots of virtual field trips.
[78:22.82]So just check out the website.
[78:25.92]That's so cool.
[78:27.28]It's actually going to field trip, but with COVID you can't.
[78:29.76]So that's cool.
[78:31.30]Is this virtual field trips?
[78:36.70]There we go.
[78:37.20]One more.
[78:38.16]Get that one in there.
[78:46.08]There we go, got it.
[78:48.24]There we go!
[78:50.55]Crush it!
[78:52.45]This is gonna be, so this is totally gonna, this highlight's gonna be total ASMR, isn't it?
[78:55.87]Ooh.
[79:03.80]Half of that has like a shard coming out of it, the other half is empty.
[79:06.98]Yes, we've got the smoky quartz in here again, so that gray variety of quartz.
[79:11.32]And then we have calcite growing in here secondarily.
[79:13.98]Calcite?
[79:14.60]Calcite's the white bladey stuff.
[79:16.86]Oh.
[79:17.36]So that's a couple different phases of different types of fluids passing through this thing.
[79:21.32]This is so cool.
[79:22.58]See that one?
[79:24.22]Yeah, let me get a close-up of this one.
[79:26.13]This one has like a blade in it.
[79:29.25]This is like the coolest thing I've ever done.
[79:30.93]This is like the most fun I've ever had in my life.
[79:35.60]Look at that.
[79:40.84]Just like a blade going through it.
[79:45.10]Wow, and this is a huge display here.
[79:47.15]Alright, how about... Oh, yeah, there's still one there.
[79:52.41]Let's get this little one.
[79:57.29]Got this little guy.
[79:59.57]This one's also pretty dirty.
[80:02.97]Very dirty.
[80:04.23]Geoform and all sorts of different geologic processes, so.
[80:07.35]Alright, let's see what's in here.
[80:11.17]Ready?
[80:11.81]Let's do it.
[80:14.37]And that?
[80:14.69]What do we got?
[80:17.67]Oh my god, those are Stardew Valley seed packets.
[80:20.95]Ah, it's not that great.
[80:22.65]That's too bad.
[80:23.16]It would be nice if there was some fiery quartz in there or something.
[80:28.41]And they're also the way that the water flows over the air.
[80:31.33]This is a little bit different in the process, a little bit different.
[80:36.51]We'll call it anthropogenic.
[80:38.36]Okay.
[80:39.48]Yeah, this is anthropogenic, which means it can have been an enclosed bubble of sorts of sorts, but Paul Pog started Valley Sea Pack.
[80:49.91]It's a pretty PogChamp.
[80:51.49]Wow.
[80:57.76]You didn't think there was going to be comedy?
[80:59.84]You didn't think there was going to be comedy?
[81:03.78]This is, my back, this is embarrassing.
[81:07.00]Wardrobe malfunction.
[81:08.88]Just hope it doesn't, like, fly down.
[81:12.09]That looks good.
[81:14.49]Give me one more.
[81:17.03]I can't wait to do that huge one.
[81:18.11]That's going to be cool.
[81:21.03]Just by looking at that, do you have any idea what could be in there?
[81:24.27]No, I mean, every single one of these is a surprise.
[81:26.57]You never know until you pop them open.
[81:27.57]That's so cool.
[81:29.57]I could literally do this every day, all day.
[81:33.69]Here we go.
[81:36.80]That one's also kind of like empty.
[81:39.36]Yeah, it's the smoky quartz variety.
[81:42.28]But this one obviously didn't have a whole lot of fluids pumping through it because the minerals are really small and we got mostly hollow space.
[81:49.21]That's so cool.
[81:51.85]Yeah, it's almost like perfectly, it's like a perfect circle inside.
[81:56.06]It's a perfect circle of just nothing.
[81:58.78]An air bubble in a rock.
[81:59.98]An air, yeah, kind of like the Stardew Valley seed packets in the Minecraft diamonds that we found earlier.
[82:04.08]It's really nothing like that.
[82:06.88]It could be.
[82:08.78]Oh, look, there it is, the Minecraft diamond.
[82:12.61]Alright, we're getting to, what do we got?
[82:15.77]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[82:17.53]We've got, we'll do three more little ones, and we're going to do this guy here.
[82:22.73]That one, this is like, I can't wait to see what's in there.
[82:27.47]Oh, we also have that one too.
[82:32.74]Now this one already has stuff.
[82:36.74]We're going to tape it this time.
[82:37.54]Are you going to tape it?
[82:38.46]If you, if you look closely, you can see kind of that texture on it.
[82:41.52]That's, uh, it's quartz, but it's microscopic quartz.
[82:44.33]It has some water in it.
[82:45.69]So it's called, yeah, so it's called agate.
[82:48.15]So if you hear somebody talk about agate, it's just a special type of quartz.
[82:50.92]Huh, cool.
[82:52.10]Well, let's see if there's any more inside.
[82:53.76]And this is little, so this would break pretty easily.
[82:56.65]Famous last words.
[82:59.09]Watch this be harder than all of them.
[83:02.85]You guys having fun?
[83:03.47]I don't even know what camera's on.
[83:07.56]Snap it!
[83:08.72]Crotch!
[83:11.36]That's one of the coolest ones so far.
[83:13.78]Cool.
[83:14.02]Let me lift this up.
[83:16.72]Wow, it's got like little tendrils.
[83:20.62]This is insane looking.
[83:22.60]Look at that.
[83:24.17]How does it, why does this happen?
[83:25.57]This is a secondary type of quartz mineralization.
[83:29.55]And so it makes these kind of weird finger like structures.
[83:33.19]It looks like thread.
[83:35.43]They're delicate too.
[83:36.31]Even though it's made out of the stuff that makes up the crust of our planet, it's actually a really delicate mineral.
[83:40.41]So you could actually like break these pretty with your finger.
[83:42.24]I kind of don't want to.
[83:44.32]I want to keep it intact.
[83:46.42]Let's get it underneath here.
[83:48.16]underneath our patented microscope and camera technology.
[83:54.56]Look at that.
[83:55.48]Whoa.
[83:57.40]Pretty cool.
[83:59.00]That's really cool.
[84:00.16]Look at this one.
[84:00.92]They're even finer on this one.
[84:04.76]And that's when we get lots of water interacting in our geode.
[84:08.01]Wow.
[84:09.11]That's so cool.
[84:10.75]That's one of my favorite ones so far.
[84:12.09]What is this?
[84:15.29]This one is... What's this one?
[84:17.58]Oh, it doesn't look like one of the geodes, does it?
[84:19.81]Um, I mean... It's a little bit different shape.
[84:24.51]Well, no.
[84:28.65]Isn't that your teeth?
[84:33.12]This is a smoky granite.
[84:35.74]I can tell by the flavor.
[84:37.78]Smoky granite with a hint.
[84:39.90]A dog peed on it.
[84:41.38]I think I'm going to be over by the crusher.
[84:43.86]Dog peed on this probably a couple years ago.
[84:45.91]I can smell the formaldehyde from the dog pee.
[84:49.45]Okay, yep.
[84:51.43]Not formaldehyde, ammonia, right?
[84:53.25]Alright, let's do this one.
[84:58.87]Crushing machines.
[85:03.75]That was good.
[85:04.19]You want to try it?
[85:05.91]I'll take your word for it.
[85:06.83]Okay, no, it's delicious.
[85:08.69]I guess you do need some silica in your diet.
[85:09.95]Yeah, oh yeah.
[85:11.13]Here we go.
[85:13.67]No not.
[85:14.91]Swing and a miss.
[85:15.95]Swing and a miss.
[85:17.03]Strike one.
[85:17.96]There we go.
[85:24.40]Let's see if we get any more squid rocks.
[85:30.08]This one's tough.
[85:32.04]Hold on.
[85:32.68]One more.
[85:33.16]There it is.
[85:33.50]That's a nice pretty quartz one again.
[85:39.99]We've got some really nice crystal faces, especially on this one right here.
[85:42.96]So would you, okay, so for all of us video gamers out there, would you qualify this as like a common?
[85:49.70]Would you qualify the amethyst as kind of rare to see that, like the purple?
[85:53.61]In the world of quartz, I'd say amethyst is more of a rare, but I would say there's nothing more common than this.
[85:58.29]OK.
[85:58.71]So what would you say is like, wow, legendary status?
[86:01.77]Like, I can't believe that's in there.
[86:02.85]Legendary status would be if we had some really nice sulfide minerals.
[86:08.04]So those are things like cobalite or things like that, really brilliant blue colors.
[86:12.52]And is that possible in one of these?
[86:14.70]Potentially.
[86:15.28]I mean, it just depends on what was in the groundwater, what was going through it.
[86:18.24]So we got, how many, how many like card packs do we have left over before we get like our legendary?
[86:22.72]Well, if it's anything like some of those games, at least another five to seven hundred dollars worth.
[86:26.49]Apparently we had Minecraft diamonds.
[86:28.17]We did get Minecraft diamonds, that's right.
[86:33.99]Ah, we got that guy there.
[86:35.03]I keep forgetting to do that one.
[86:37.89]Uh, these two look cool.
[86:39.52]I'm getting sad that there's only like five to ten left to do.
[86:43.73]No, it can't.
[86:44.83]This has to continue.
[86:45.87]I need to do this like every minute of my life.
[86:48.86]This is like geologic Christmas.
[86:54.02]Let's get it in there.
[87:00.42]There it is.
[87:01.04]Alright, it's in a good spot.
[87:02.90]You want to do the honors on this one?
[87:03.82]Sure.
[87:10.99]Crunch.
[87:12.93]Ooh, wait, wait, wait.
[87:14.91]Ooh, you got a squid rock.
[87:16.27]Oh, a squid, OK.
[87:18.05]See the little finger quirts in there?
[87:19.76]Oh, there's like tiny little fingers.
[87:22.90]Oh, hold on to that one.
[87:23.80]Look, can you see that?
[87:24.82]I'll put it in the microscopic camera technology that we have.
[87:27.52]Double zoom technology.
[87:30.40]Can you see in there?
[87:33.65]There is this really, really bizarre looking swirl.
[87:38.95]Can you see it?
[87:39.47]I don't think you can see it.
[87:42.98]There's like a little swirly at the very bottom of this one.
[87:46.34]I don't know if you can pick it up.
[87:48.08]I think that's the agate.
[87:49.26]So I think you're getting the really water rich courts in there.
[87:51.56]Yeah, it's really deep.
[87:53.00]This goes all the way in and look at the fingers on this one.
[87:59.02]Get in there.
[88:00.20]See the tiny little like, uh, like, like flora or something, right?
[88:05.91]That's so awesome.
[88:08.15]Alright.
[88:13.41]Time for a big guy.
[88:15.99]Oh, this one's really heavy.
[88:19.69]This one is extraordinarily heavy.
[88:22.36]Alright.
[88:24.24]Yeah, so we're gonna try to get this long ways if it's possible.
[88:28.28]So that being that heavy is, what kind of a sign is that?
[88:31.10]I think we're gonna have, it's gonna be full, so.
[88:33.32]Oh, wow.
[88:34.83]Hope we have enough chain to do them all.
[88:36.75]Yeah, a little more slack.
[88:38.61]We're popping out over here.
[88:39.61]Popping out over there.
[88:40.93]Oh, man.
[88:42.14]Lift it up.
[88:42.56]Come down maybe around here.
[88:47.50]There.
[88:47.94]That looks good.
[88:50.08]Oh, this is going to work.
[88:52.14]We have just enough chain.
[88:53.34]I don't know if we're going to be able to get your hammer for the next one.
[88:56.79]Right there.
[88:58.15]Alright, that's in.
[89:00.55]Oh, wow.
[89:01.33]Alright, this is in.
[89:05.19]Oh, man.
[89:07.95]Here we go.
[89:08.43]You ready?
[89:10.63]Oh, God.
[89:13.35]Alright.
[89:13.61]Come on.
[89:14.01]Cobalt blue.
[89:14.75]Cobalt blue.
[89:15.43]Cobalt blue.
[89:16.49]Everybody think it, and we'll get it.
[89:19.15]We need a legendary.
[89:22.66]Here we go.
[89:27.78]Come on.
[89:29.42]Come on.
[89:37.62]Oh, it doesn't want to do it.
[89:41.80]Do we have any score?
[89:42.56]Gotta go quick.
[89:47.40]You guys ready?
[89:51.27]We gotta go down one more rung.
[89:54.01]I can feel it too.
[89:54.89]It's about to go.
[89:55.53]Let's see if we can get it up here.
[90:04.41]Alright, that'll do it.
[90:07.21]Oh yeah.
[90:09.21]Here we go.
[90:16.65]Crap!
[90:19.57]We might have to, maybe this way.
[90:25.67]Ah, look at the score.
[90:26.87]It's right there.
[90:27.57]It's written.
[90:28.93]Can we get?
[90:30.01]Yeah.
[90:31.03]It'll probably be easier to get two people to hold it.
[90:39.02]Oh, thank God for production, Jake.
[90:42.30]Also known as community.
[90:43.62]Community Jake.
[90:45.74]Alright, so that's right there.
[90:46.76]There it is.
[90:49.08]Alright, lift it up a little.
[90:52.45]Get it in there.
[90:54.19]Alright, is that it?
[90:56.15]Maybe.
[90:56.71]Maybe.
[90:57.17]Let's give it a try.
[90:57.81]Let's see if I can get it.
[90:59.47]Watch your hands.
[91:01.25]Yeah, this is it.
[91:04.09]Alright, we good?
[91:05.41]You got a good shot of this?
[91:10.45]You might need a few people to help with this one.
[91:12.83]You wanna try to, we'll put some weight here?
[91:21.14]Oh, come on!
[91:27.76]Come on, it's so close!
[91:31.01]Yeah, do it!
[91:34.69]Come on, break!
[91:36.29]Break!
[91:36.77]We're not breaking the tool, are we?
[91:41.77]Wow!
[91:43.48]Oh my god!
[91:45.94]Oh my god!
[91:47.16]Holy shit!
[91:49.06]That looks insane!
[91:51.24]You gotta get this part up here.
[91:54.20]Look at that.
[91:55.86]They sell that stuff in stores.
[91:57.78]They sell this stuff.
[91:58.72]You see that in the stores.
[92:00.43]If you're born in February, this is your birthstone.
[92:02.73]What is that?
[92:03.09]It's amethyst?
[92:03.73]Huh?
[92:05.05]No, cobalt.
[92:06.16]no cobalt but that's pretty that looks unbelievable wow these jaw this is a display piece that's what this is oh my goodness can we get this out of here that took so much I wonder can you see what we got can you see well that's like look at somebody's teeth
[92:36.47]That's beautiful.
[92:37.13]I feel like if I go, look what I did Bobby.
[92:48.14]How's it look?
[92:50.14]Wow.
[92:52.06]We are probably going to need like three or four of us to pull that one.
[92:58.02]That one is going to be very difficult.
[93:00.66]That's unbelievable.
[93:01.50]That's so cool.
[93:03.65]oh wow alright well now let's relax a little bit and uh do a couple of the of the smaller ones look at these look at this here so what is it what is there something that makes it more purple it's just the amount of iron it's actually just microscopic amounts just that tiny little bit uh impurity can completely change the nature and color of the mineral wow and this this has like blue under what's the blue underneath
[93:32.07]To me, that looks a little bit like a copper ore.
[93:34.75]So there was probably some copper mineralization before the quartz came in.
[93:39.31]This is so cool.
[93:39.97]If a copper gets exposed to air, it turns that greenish color.
[93:44.20]Oh, look at that.
[93:45.86]Yeah, they put, they put, they drop it on the ground.
[93:49.58]They put this on necklaces.
[93:52.60]You buy that and put it on a necklace.
[93:56.31]That's so cool.
[93:56.91]Alright, let's move.
[93:58.73]This is heavy too.
[94:01.03]Alright, let's do a couple more.
[94:01.95]That was by far the best one.
[94:04.30]And that was an explosion, too.
[94:05.52]Did you get the explosion on camera?
[94:07.00]Yeah.
[94:07.76]Oh, yeah.
[94:09.46]Somebody slow-mo that one.
[94:15.26]Just don't show her face, it's troubling.
[94:17.71]Just like playing tug-of-war with a geode.
[94:23.03]Alright, right?
[94:24.77]Let's do this one.
[94:27.17]That was very easy.
[94:28.05]And?
[94:29.76]Cool.
[94:30.62]Oh, more tendrils.
[94:31.32]One of those finger court structures.
[94:39.55]This one, they're even smaller.
[94:42.03]So what's the, is this just sand?
[94:43.33]What's the brown and... Let me take a look.
[94:51.33]Those are probably some sort of aluminum mineral would be my guess.
[94:54.48]Cool.
[94:55.88]So how does it get in there?
[94:57.28]Again, this is all, everything that's in this former air bubble has to get there through groundwater.
[95:01.46]So water just, yeah.
[95:02.26]There's all sorts of minerals in your groundwater.
[95:05.84]Wow.
[95:07.08]Depending on where you live, it's different types of minerals.
[95:11.50]Look at this guy here.
[95:13.70]Kind of pink.
[95:15.34]Does the pink mean anything important?
[95:17.62]That's just the type of volcano, volcanic eruption it came from.
[95:21.24]So that one has probably lots of quartz in it.
[95:23.20]It's going to be quartz.
[95:26.66]I hope that one is filled with blue legendary crystals.
[95:34.67]How many do we have left?
[95:35.71]Just a kind of naked eye?
[95:36.97]Six?
[95:39.53]Only six left.
[95:40.45]Alright, you want to give this one a pull?
[95:57.44]Another one of the fingers.
[96:00.86]Ooh.
[96:02.82]So is there a reason?
[96:03.86]Can you see like the waves in there?
[96:05.02]It's almost like a spiral.
[96:08.31]Oh, that's interesting.
[96:09.17]Yeah, what would cause a spiral like that?
[96:11.19]It's just however the water was interacting with the substrate, so.
[96:14.49]So it's all water.
[96:15.79]Each one of these air bubbles is its own little microenvironment, so each one's going to be unique.
[96:20.64]Yeah, so maybe this one can show up on the... Well, I haven't looked at Chad in like an hour.
[96:28.43]Oh no, not the spiral.
[96:31.59]Team Tendril.
[96:33.85]Team Tendril?
[96:34.99]Can you see?
[96:36.67]Let's get a look down here.
[96:43.14]I don't know if you can pick it up, but see like the center?
[96:46.08]It's just got like this weird spiral.
[96:52.00]That's awesome.
[96:54.68]The sadness is washing over me.
[97:02.54]get this up here so just out of curiosity if there was like cobalt in here would that would that be worth anything it'd be worth something in terms of cobalt itself is highly desirable mineral the metal because of what it does for technology and it's also desirable just as a collecting item too well oh he's coming to fix logos on here
[97:31.88]Wait, like Star Wars?
[97:33.04]The Star Wars logo?
[97:34.74]I'm here to protect you.
[97:37.40]You're here to help me?
[97:38.06]Because this is literally the bag costume of Poe from Star Wars?
[97:42.75]Oh, that's what we're trying to do.
[97:44.27]You're trying to protect me.
[97:46.01]Oh, thank you.
[97:47.21]I appreciate it.
[97:47.97]Here we go.
[97:56.34]This one's the thick one.
[97:57.14]It's tight.
[98:03.37]There we go.
[98:04.05]Maybe a bit more in the center.
[98:07.35]I feel like this one's gonna be a good one.
[98:11.64]Maybe move it a little, there we go.
[98:15.34]This one's thick.
[98:19.34]Come on, get in there.
[98:21.80]Right there, right there.
[98:26.24]Right down the middle, right there.
[98:27.40]Alright, that should be it.
[98:35.05]It's a process.
[98:40.56]There we go.
[98:41.20]Alright.
[98:41.40]That's the money.
[98:43.52]That's the money, right?
[98:44.24]Yeah, it is.
[98:44.66]Absolutely.
[98:45.04]Here we go.
[98:45.36]That one was hard.
[98:56.37]That was the reason why the, ooh.
[98:57.25]It's fuzzy.
[98:57.93]It's a nice pretty quartz one.
[99:01.13]It's like furry.
[99:02.62]All those are just microscopic, or not microscopic, but they're just tiny little quartz crystals.
[99:07.16]Wow.
[99:07.68]This one you can kind of see that two-stage growth again, where you've got agate and then quartz crystals.
[99:13.02]Wow.
[99:13.22]Let me see this one.
[99:14.64]See if we can get this one under the camera.
[99:17.96]I'm waiting for the blue.
[99:20.38]We might not get it.
[99:22.46]These are still pretty spectacular.
[99:24.00]Yeah, these are awesome.
[99:25.72]Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but these could all have been duds.
[99:28.73]Right?
[99:28.91]There could be nothing in it.
[99:29.97]You never know when you get a geode.
[99:31.05]Sometimes you crack them open and they're just still an air pocket.
[99:33.97]So how hard are we going to lap when we open the huge one?
[99:36.15]It's just literally a rock.
[99:37.45]There's nothing in it.
[99:38.05]That's part of the fun.
[99:41.61]That is part of the fun.
[99:43.71]Let's bring a couple of these baseball ones over.
[99:53.73]Alright, here we go.
[99:58.40]This one should go pretty quickly.
[100:02.00]Safety first as always, and let's give it a pull.
[100:04.62]Here we go.
[100:05.24]One, two, three.
[100:09.14]That looks interesting.
[100:11.19]Oh, I saw like the brown.
[100:12.89]Oh, that is actually really interesting.
[100:14.79]We got some of those calcite blades again.
[100:18.63]Team blade?
[100:20.53]Calcite's a mineral that makes up limestone.
[100:23.78]Oh, so is this quartz still?
[100:26.45]No, this is a different mineral.
[100:27.61]So that's limestone.
[100:28.41]Yep.
[100:30.00]It's in pretty form.
[100:31.96]There's so many different kinds of rocks.
[100:34.86]Could you spend an entire lifetime trying to find it?
[100:38.26]It's randomly generated.
[100:40.14]No two rocks are the same.
[100:41.33]No two rocks are the same.
[100:42.57]And there are people that spend their entire careers out there looking for new types of rocks.
[100:46.17]And they're still naming new minerals.
[100:47.41]So there's stuff out there we don't even know about yet.
[100:49.07]Get involved in your local science community now.
[100:51.91]You see how cool this is?
[100:53.99]I'm 35.
[100:54.21]If I was like 20, oh my god, I would start doing this.
[100:58.74]This is the coolest thing I've ever done in my whole life.
[101:10.25]Let me get that situated.
[101:14.33]And then.
[101:15.89]In there?
[101:16.77]Almost.
[101:17.13]Alright.
[101:22.11]And again, that's ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[101:24.29]Correct.
[101:25.29]Yes, come visit and our schedule of virtual field trips is on there.
[101:28.79]Go take a virtual field trip.
[101:29.91]Think of how cool that would be.
[101:31.62]Go take a virtual field trip.
[101:33.42]And they're at no cost to the public.
[101:34.62]And it's free.
[101:36.38]Wait, hold on.
[101:36.98]I want to make that.
[101:37.50]Did you hear that that was free?
[101:38.18]You don't have to pay anything.
[101:41.00]Passionate people, support them.
[101:42.70]Alright, a little bit tighter.
[101:45.22]There we go.
[101:50.88]Here we go.
[102:02.41]This one was almost a dud, but we did get a couple minerals in it.
[102:05.61]Oh, that's close to a dud, you're right.
[102:09.47]So a true dud would just be like the limestone.
[102:12.21]Just be rock, yeah.
[102:14.37]I'm surprised we haven't had any that are like that.
[102:16.41]No duds yet.
[102:16.93]Zero.
[102:17.35]No duds at all.
[102:18.17]We don't want to jinx ourselves.
[102:19.67]Yeah, it's going to be the big one.
[102:23.82]It has to be.
[102:24.66]The big one's going to be a dud, and I'm scared of it.
[102:28.16]You've already resigned yourself to it?
[102:29.82]Yeah, because then if it's awesome, then we get to all be excited.
[102:31.94]I think that's called low expectations, right?
[102:35.58]Yeah.
[102:38.41]Very low expectations, but very high reward if it is good.
[102:45.63]Here we go again.
[102:46.11]That's a nice one.
[102:50.88]Looks like snow.
[102:53.22]So it's all agate in there.
[102:56.50]What's that?
[102:56.86]Water-rich quartz.
[103:00.06]Get it under the microscopic camera.
[103:06.53]You get a good look.
[103:09.24]Can I see the chat?
[103:10.56]What's it saying?
[103:15.92]Geodandy?
[103:23.70]Geodandy.
[103:25.16]No, I think he's Geodandy.
[103:29.67]No, it's not Andy from Toy Story.
[103:31.97]You got that wrong.
[103:32.97]Oh wait, I look like Andy from Toy Story.
[103:38.61]Oh, I thought they were... Oh my God.
[103:44.97]Take this off, get this off.
[103:52.12]It's a bandana, get it off.
[103:54.80]Hey, did you know that every Andy, no, every little kid in Toy Story is an Andy?
[104:00.25]Did you know that?
[104:01.49]They didn't want to animate extra kids, so they're all Andy.
[104:04.55]Look it up, that's a real thing.
[104:06.89]This is like bolted on my neck.
[104:16.80]Here we go.
[104:19.24]Gio to Andy.
[104:25.92]You got it?
[104:29.71]Yep.
[104:29.99]Ooh, another close dud.
[104:31.23]That's cool.
[104:33.09]It's got like a little slice.
[104:34.11]Little quartz crystals in there.
[104:36.96]That's really cool.
[104:38.00]I'm just looking at these on the ground.
[104:41.24]That's awesome.
[104:43.90]Alright, we are down to the final five regular ones.
[104:49.39]We have no legendaries yet, which is, you know, whatever.
[104:52.59]And then we've got this guy.
[104:54.21]This is probably going to take everybody on set.
[104:59.63]Let's do the last six.
[105:01.63]Oh wait, we have an extra one here.
[105:21.80]Oh, that might do it.
[105:29.14]Well, now that's different.
[105:31.00]What's the orange?
[105:32.46]The orange is a lot of iron minerals.
[105:37.11]So this one's kind of a dud.
[105:38.93]Out of the shadow.
[105:39.89]Yeah.
[105:40.75]That one's a dud?
[105:42.37]There's a little quartz crust in it.
[105:43.89]Oh, your half is way better.
[105:45.27]Oh, is mine better?
[105:46.05]Yeah.
[105:46.43]You got lots of little quartz crystals in there.
[105:49.41]Let's get a close-up.
[105:51.78]Oh, sorry.
[105:53.38]What do we got for extreme time?
[105:55.74]How long have I been doing this for?
[105:56.92]I'm just obsessed.
[105:58.54]Yeah, one hour and 50.
[105:59.58]Oh, cool.
[105:59.92]Alright.
[106:03.50]This is awesome.
[106:04.32]Alright, let's keep going.
[106:05.05]Do you want to put the detail on it last time?
[106:11.85]Yeah, I'll get in there and do it after this.
[106:17.73]Alright, here we go.
[106:19.89]Come on, cobalt.
[106:21.49]Legendary.
[106:21.99]This one's tight.
[106:29.05]It's a pretty amethyst one.
[106:37.66]Another amethyst.
[106:38.44]Whoa, what's growing out here?
[106:40.66]What's at the bottom?
[106:42.92]That like weird, like brown and beige?
[106:46.22]Yeah, you've got a different type of quartz crystal starting to grow in there.
[106:50.69]So the agate grew inside the hole, then the amethyst grew, and then there was water starting to come in again, and there was a third phase of mineral growth starting in there.
[107:00.45]So here's a really good question for you.
[107:01.95]These look, they're like little triangles.
[107:04.59]They're beautiful.
[107:05.85]I got a good question for you.
[107:06.97]How long does it take to happen?
[107:09.10]Thousands of years.
[107:10.00]Thousands of years.
[107:11.64]If not millions, yeah.
[107:12.70]Millions or thousands, wow.
[107:13.80]Let's get some detail on this one.
[107:18.16]Try to get the light to hit it.
[107:20.57]Not sure how well you can see, the sun is starting to change a little.
[107:24.09]What was that?
[107:24.79]It looks really good.
[107:25.31]Does it look good?
[107:27.17]Look at those little triangles.
[107:30.27]Those are called the crystal faces.
[107:31.94]Crystal faces.
[107:33.80]Very cool.
[107:36.56]All leading up to the final gigantic one, which we'll see.
[107:40.62]I think this is the smallest one so far.
[107:44.47]This is a little guy.
[107:47.43]How heavy is it?
[107:49.09]Oh, it's not bad.
[107:50.48]What do you think?
[107:53.32]So again, the heavier this is, the more it could be inside.
[107:55.72]I thought it was just burped right into the camera, which would have been weird.
[108:03.77]Get it up there.
[108:08.93]And again, safety first.
[108:11.83]Workers gloves.
[108:18.88]Here we go.
[108:23.01]Team Tendril, you've got another crewmate.
[108:26.41]That one was heavy because it was pretty full of minerals.
[108:28.35]Yeah.
[108:29.43]It's a pretty one.
[108:29.95]These will look a little more clear too.
[108:34.20]Oh, you want me to get the detail of that other one, right?
[108:37.78]This one here.
[108:39.40]Yeah.
[108:41.66]Right here, this one here.
[108:46.83]What was the orange rock you said?
[108:48.65]It's probably some iron-rich rock.
[108:51.40]Oftentimes you get lots of metals that are in lava flows.
[108:54.30]Really cool.
[108:56.28]This looks like a map.
[108:57.48]Like if I pressed M in a game.
[108:59.16]I've got to tie it back to the gamers, you know what I mean?
[109:02.96]I just saw the cut and I thought, okay, we'll catch you.
[109:05.64]I'm trying to catch the cut.
[109:06.54]I can see the monitor here.
[109:08.29]Take a look at this one.
[109:16.15]How's that look?
[109:17.63]Get a good shot of that.
[109:18.63]It looks like a snake head.
[109:22.45]A snake head?
[109:23.15]Yeah, the tendril on the top.
[109:25.89]Oh, okay.
[109:27.51]Oh, it does.
[109:28.04]You're right.
[109:28.36]It does look like a snake.
[109:30.36]Right there.
[109:30.70]Right at the top.
[109:33.04]Very cool.
[109:33.32]What are you guys saying?
[109:35.96]Crack rock.
[109:40.64]Well, that's not what it is.
[109:43.78]Alright, we got one, two, three.
[109:46.74]And that's it.
[109:47.66]And then we got to bring in the big guy.
[109:51.46]So funny when you said, is that the rock breaking or is that the tool breaking?
[110:00.81]I can already see the quartz coming out of the edge here.
[110:03.97]So this is going to be quartz Andy.
[110:08.55]Let me get a little bit more over here.
[110:12.01]Alright, here we go.
[110:21.79]Very, very heavy quartz, Crack Rock Andy.
[110:24.10]Yeah, that one's a nice one.
[110:26.18]Nice pure quartz.
[110:27.06]You can see the nice crystal faces in there, glimmering in the sun.
[110:32.85]It's just about the water, right?
[110:33.87]So when they fill in deep into the middle, does that mean that they have more time?
[110:39.25]More time, exactly.
[110:40.53]More time for those minerals to grow and grow on top of each other and fill in that void.
[110:44.59]Awesome.
[110:45.27]That's so cool.
[110:46.23]This is like rethinking my entire life choices here doing this.
[110:51.18]I should have been a geologist.
[110:53.12]I get it.
[110:54.34]This is the coolest thing ever.
[110:57.78]You know, after this one, I think I've got to get going before a place closes in town.
[111:02.04]Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[111:03.72]After this one.
[111:04.38]Yeah, that's cool.
[111:06.26]Seriously, thanks for coming.
[111:07.30]You've got to go somewhere.
[111:09.49]You've got to be somewhere, right?
[111:10.85]My pleasure.
[111:11.83]We always aim to educate.
[111:12.97]Yeah.
[111:14.87]And again, that's ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[111:17.13]They do field trips, virtual field trips.
[111:19.37]Support them.
[111:22.03]Because honestly, without them, this kind of doesn't happen.
[111:26.17]Because I don't know anything about what's inside of these rocks.
[111:29.11]I'm just the clown that cracks these nuts.
[111:32.43]Here we go.
[111:41.73]Do we got something good?
[111:46.75]Pretty agate.
[111:51.33]That nice cloudy texture.
[111:56.83]Oh, that's cool.
[111:59.07]Looks like a pair of eyes.
[112:04.16]Let's get a close up of this one.
[112:08.88]What's that?
[112:10.36]No, it's purple, but it's not blue.
[112:12.18]No, we don't have any legendaries, unfortunately.
[112:21.13]Look at that.
[112:23.07]Nice.
[112:23.57]Beautiful.
[112:24.81]It's been a pleasure.
[112:25.43]Thank you for having me today.
[112:26.65]Yeah, seriously, thank you for coming out here and doing this because this is impossible without your help.
[112:31.38]So thank you so much.
[112:32.54]That's ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[112:34.84]Support your local scientists, your local educators.
[112:37.92]Please, for the love of God, thank you for coming.
[112:41.25]Thank you.
[112:41.85]It's been a pleasure.
[112:42.83]Seriously.
[112:44.39]Got somewhere to go.
[112:45.71]Let's go.
[112:46.77]We got two more.
[112:49.52]We got the big one that's left.
[112:55.11]We're going to get the whole crew up in that last one.
[113:04.19]That was awesome.
[113:04.95]That was seriously awesome.
[113:06.87]That's why you got to get somebody that knows what they're talking about.
[113:08.71]Let's go like this.
[113:13.34]Because, yeah, I could have done this stream.
[113:16.00]And just, what am I going to do?
[113:17.02]I'm going to sit here and go...
[113:19.87]Whoa!
[113:21.83]Whoa!
[113:23.87]Oh!
[113:24.36]But I don't know anything.
[113:26.54]Here we go.
[113:34.26]Come on!
[113:41.24]That stayed in there.
[113:43.50]That stuck around.
[113:48.01]Alright, come on, come on, I got it, I got it, I remember what he said.
[113:50.53]So this is the, this is the... I forgot everything.
[113:54.15]This is the mineral, and then this is the quartz, it's got smoky quartz in the center, and then the water dissipated outside of the pores of the rock, and created, um... I gotta go back, I gotta go back, I gotta get him back.
[114:08.80]I gotta figure out what else, what else is in here.
[114:11.08]I'm gonna get a legendary and he's not gonna be here.
[114:13.44]I'm gonna be like... Okay.
[114:19.74]Enough stalling.
[114:22.35]It's time to do the big one.
[114:24.63]Are we ready to try to do the big one?
[114:28.77]Are you guys ready?
[114:32.01]Crack rock.
[114:35.95]Look at all these crack rocks.
[114:37.65]It's not all crack.
[114:40.39]This thing is, by the way, can we get a confirmed weight on this?
[114:43.18]It's 50 pounds.
[114:45.08]This is 50 pounds.
[114:49.11]So whatever is in here.
[114:50.15]Alright, it's already scored up here.
[114:56.17]I wonder, will the chain be big enough for this?
[114:57.67]We could try.
[114:58.99]Oh, God.
[115:01.48]No.
[115:01.98]No?
[115:02.32]Not at all?
[115:05.62]I think it is.
[115:07.36]Oh, we need one more person.
[115:09.84]No, it's not long enough.
[115:11.30]Is it not long enough?
[115:12.20]No, we have to go the other way.
[115:13.26]Alright.
[115:17.70]God.
[115:21.56]Got it.
[115:21.80]I got the rock.
[115:22.22]You got the rock?
[115:22.76]Yeah.
[115:28.28]Come on.
[115:29.67]Come on.
[115:30.33]A little bit higher.
[115:34.29]Should we try to get a long way?
[115:35.97]It doesn't fit.
[115:37.71]The chain doesn't fit.
[115:38.85]Maybe the, um, hold on.
[115:40.05]Can we do this?
[115:41.79]We could probably go like that.
[115:43.88]We could try.
[115:44.50]Like, you know, like diagonal?
[115:46.12]Yeah, let's give it a shot.
[115:46.76]Alright, so if we go, I'll hold the rock.
[115:51.30]So if we go like this, maybe from like, can we get it like that?
[115:56.82]That may be.
[116:07.42]That might not be tight enough.
[116:08.28]No, it's not going to be tight enough?
[116:13.97]Yeah.
[116:14.23]I feel like I'm handling like a nuclear warhead.
[116:17.75]If I hold it, can you get the chain?
[116:19.49]Yeah.
[116:20.44]Actually, you know what?
[116:20.90]Here, try this.
[116:21.60]Okay.
[116:22.32]Let's go like this.
[116:22.80]Hold the chain all the way out.
[116:24.44]Yep.
[116:26.40]Okay, wrap it around.
[116:27.12]Okay.
[116:29.64]Okay, is it around the whole thing?
[116:31.72]What do you mean?
[116:32.24]Like, if we go like this.
[116:33.70]Oh.
[116:34.62]Uh-huh.
[116:35.16]Can that make it?
[116:35.68]It's not even close.
[116:37.20]Shit!
[116:39.98]Well, that's it!
[116:40.62]Stream's up!
[116:41.10]No, I'm just kidding.
[116:44.28]Should we just hit it with a hammer?
[116:48.37]Should we just smack this thing?
[116:49.95]It's already scored right here.
[116:52.25]Sure.
[116:53.69]What do you think?
[116:54.59]Yeah, got a hammer.
[116:56.07]Should we go horizontal or should we hit it with a hammer?
[117:00.07]What do you guys think?
[117:03.93]Show Otto.
[117:05.69]Why would Otto be here?
[117:08.39]Chisel, chisel, chisel.
[117:09.31]Get the excavator.
[117:10.21]I'm not going to break it.
[117:13.35]Alright, here we go.
[117:17.49]So I've been instructed.
[117:18.57]We got instructions?
[117:19.61]Yeah.
[117:21.15]So you're going to put this in the score.
[117:23.55]Okay.
[117:24.37]And then hit this with that.
[117:25.57]And just smash it?
[117:26.49]And smash it, yeah.
[117:30.03]Tap it?
[117:31.13]Tap it.
[117:31.69]Tap it.
[117:31.95]Are we ready to try this right in the score?
[117:33.27]Yeah, just tap it.
[117:34.22]Here we go.
[117:37.98]That's working.
[117:39.02]Yeah.
[117:41.96]Oh my goodness.
[117:45.48]Oh my god.
[117:46.66]Whoa.
[117:49.20]Hold on.
[117:49.56]Hold on.
[117:54.54]Wow.
[117:55.66]Look at inside of there.
[117:56.64]Can you, hold on.
[117:59.56]Let's go like this.
[118:01.00]He's more light.
[118:01.68]We got to turn it that way.
[118:03.04]Turn towards here.
[118:03.86]Turn it this way.
[118:04.72]And then can you shoot this way, David?
[118:06.02]Shoot that way.
[118:06.48]Yeah.
[118:07.58]I'm going to just carve it off.
[118:08.62]You got it.
[118:08.84]You got it.
[118:09.24]Yeah.
[118:19.75]Oh, look at this one right here.
[118:24.12]No blue, but still, it's a rare.
[118:27.20]That's purple.
[118:29.82]That looks unbelievable.
[118:34.60]Oh my God.
[118:36.67]It's full, it's like a Halloween candy bag full of these crystals.
[118:44.59]Honestly, this is like, hold on, let me pick it up.
[118:52.38]I picked it up and it broke in my hand.
[118:53.76]It was cool looking and then I ruined it.
[119:02.41]Can you get it?
[119:06.39]This looks like the Mortal Kombat spike pit.
[119:08.83]Looks like a shark's mouth.
[119:10.01]Yeah, it looks like a mouth.
[119:11.74]It really does look like a mouth.
[119:14.48]You're blocking the light.
[119:15.16]Yeah, just turn it a little bit.
[119:17.78]I'm doing like limboing.
[119:20.23]There's a bee alright there.
[119:22.27]Oh, it's a purple.
[119:22.93]They think it's a flower.
[119:26.58]Oh, my God.
[119:27.32]Alright.
[119:29.82]Let me get one more look over here.
[119:31.06]This is the coolest thing ever.
[119:36.56]What do you guys think?
[119:38.99]Pog Rock?
[119:42.21]It looks like Dermachump.
[119:44.75]It does.
[119:50.81]It really does.
[119:52.77]I should have, alright.
[119:54.81]I'm gonna get it painted.
[119:56.93]This is gonna get painted like Jerma Trump.
[120:01.39]That's so cool, that's awesome.
[120:03.55]I'm gonna hang this on my mantle.
[120:06.61]Well, this was a lot of fun.
[120:09.32]That was a ton of fun.
[120:10.86]But that's really all we got planned.
[120:14.28]We opened up a shitload of geodes.
[120:16.64]We had scientists come in and help us decipher what was going on.
[120:20.74]This is my favorite by far.
[120:22.58]Look at this one.
[120:27.16]So cool.
[120:30.38]Awesome.
[120:32.02]I got treasures.
[120:34.50]I got cards.
[120:37.90]There's stuff in this treasure chest that I need to get, like, assessed.
[120:41.51]Some of these rocks need to get assessed.
[120:45.09]Yeah, I got...
[120:47.46]Yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[120:48.96]That's the end of this stream.
[120:50.30]I'm going to go get some of this stuff assessed.
[120:52.86]I got to see if I can make some money, because look at all this.
[120:56.34]I've got stuff in a chest.
[120:58.16]I've got geodes.
[120:59.74]I might make like $50,000, $100,000 in the next hour.
[121:04.09]Let's see if I can do it.
[121:05.71]Thank you for joining me.
[121:06.91]ScienceCenterNevada.org.
[121:08.91]Special thanks to that team for coming out here and helping us do this.
[121:12.57]So awesome.
[121:13.51]I picked the wrong career.
[121:15.70]And I'll see you next time.
[121:16.98]Keep an eye on the suss.
[121:18.91]I'm gonna go get some shit assessed.
[121:21.15]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[121:25.69]I'm gonna get the shovel.
[121:53.23]Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[121:55.03]Hello, sir.
[121:55.77]Welcome.
[121:56.69]How are you doing?
[121:57.71]Not too bad.
[121:58.29]What can I do for you today?
[122:00.04]I'm doing fantastic.
[122:01.14]Thank you for asking.
[122:02.92]I have some trinkets here for you that I would like to assess the value of.
[122:07.18]Alright.
[122:07.90]That's what they do on these programs.
[122:09.83]That is what we do here.
[122:11.29]They bring some cool stuff and you...
[122:13.33]you maybe maybe we can make a deal right tell you what they're worth yeah tell me uh tell me what you got here okay so first of all the first you got to check out this guy right here okay I don't know if that's potentially from the jurassic period or the stegosaurus period it's from some dinosaur period where um where did you come across this piece uh digging in the ground
[122:32.88]And you found it yourself, huh?
[122:34.04]Yes.
[122:34.66]Digging in the ground.
[122:35.44]Found it with a bunch of this other cool stuff.
[122:37.36]There's a story between.
[122:38.96]You don't need the story, but that in particular is probably... Did you happen to notice that it was plastic at all?
[122:45.47]No.
[122:45.99]Or that it said for pet use on it?
[122:50.25]But...
[122:53.22]But it feels kind of real.
[122:54.82]This is a completely worthless piece.
[122:56.98]It's just a plastic bone.
[122:58.50]I ordered one for my dog yesterday.
[123:00.02]But don't you have a guy?
[123:01.52]I'm not calling the guy for a plastic bone.
[123:03.54]Yeah, but you don't know that it's... Do you have a plastic machine that you... Oh, this is plastic.
[123:09.39]You don't know that that's what that is.
[123:10.77]It's reflecting.
[123:12.88]Usually, I don't know if you've ever seen the TV shows, but usually you call a guy.
[123:17.34]The guy comes in and looks at it and is like, oh, that's from Triceratops.
[123:21.94]And then you offer me $5,000 for it.
[123:25.50]Well, let's find something worth calling a guy.
[123:28.59]In that same realm, look at these.
[123:30.39]These are rocks opened up like 30 of them.
[123:33.11]Just at fresh openings.
[123:34.83]And how'd you come across these ones?
[123:36.41]In the ground, too.
[123:38.01]Just in the desert.
[123:39.93]Well, the good news, these are some beautiful geodes.
[123:44.49]So you did a great job coming across these.
[123:47.87]The bad news is they're totally worthless.
[123:49.91]I'm not buying these.
[123:50.97]People aren't coming into the shop looking for geodes.
[123:53.27]They just don't sell.
[123:55.01]They don't... Okay, what about some of the bigger... We have a big one, too.
[123:59.35]I'm not bringing that in here until you give me a price.
[124:01.59]They're rocks.
[124:03.24]Yeah, but they're cool.
[124:03.88]They're really cool.
[124:04.56]They're awesome.
[124:06.00]Maybe they make good gifts.
[124:07.38]You could try that.
[124:07.92]He literally has no idea what he's talking about.
[124:09.48]I've seen stuff like this go for 500 bucks each.
[124:13.23]You're not going to take any of these, even if I bring you the other ones?
[124:15.49]I'm not interested in that.
[124:16.43]No, you don't want any of the rocks at all?
[124:17.79]Not interested in rocks.
[124:20.77]What about the 90s snacks?
[124:22.45]We got Dunkaroos.
[124:24.07]I got these Kinder Joy stuff.
[124:26.41]This is old.
[124:27.17]And they make them, but.
[124:29.87]I got to say, there's some nostalgia here.
[124:31.83]I mean, I remember these snacks.
[124:33.75]These are some good snacks you got here.
[124:35.32]But something about snacks that you dug up just doesn't seem right.
[124:40.44]These are also completely worthless.
[124:51.47]A Blue Eyes White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh Original.
[124:55.28]This is, I know this is worth at least something.
[124:58.54]You have to have some kind of use for this.
[125:00.92]Let's take a look here.
[125:02.14]Has this been graded?
[125:03.34]Yes, it's pounds per square inch, 20.
[125:05.43]I'm not buying that.
[125:12.87]You're a liar.
[125:14.03]You are a swindler and you're a liar.
[125:15.73]You know why?
[125:16.09]Because I looked this up before in the garage when I was coming in here.
[125:19.65]This is worth at least $7.95, at least $10.
[125:22.61]I looked it up before I got in here.
[125:23.69]Did it say you pay me?
[125:25.29]No.
[125:25.63]This is how much this card is worth, at least $10.
[125:27.71]I expect you to take that for at least $15.
[125:29.39]I don't know what to tell you.
[125:30.68]Because that was an insult, what you just did to me.
[125:40.34]Do you want the Tamagotchi?
[125:42.20]Look at this.
[125:42.82]I haven't seen one of these.
[125:43.56]Oh, you're getting sleepy.
[125:45.20]I haven't seen one of these in a while.
[125:46.46]No, this stuff is not worthless.
[125:48.72]These just look like little toys, sir.
[125:51.06]This stuff is not worth looking at.
[125:52.02]This stuff doesn't have any value.
[125:53.18]You didn't even hatch the egg.
[125:54.51]You don't even know what it could be in there.
[125:55.83]It's random.
[125:56.59]Maybe you can come back after the egg hatches, and it'll still be worthless.
[126:01.69]What about these Stardew Valley seed packets?
[126:04.03]These what?
[126:05.45]Stardew Valley seed packets and a Minecraft diamond.
[126:08.49]You know what Stardew Valley is, right?
[126:09.95]I don't speak French, sir.
[126:12.62]You've never heard of Stardew Valley?
[126:14.02]I don't know any idea what you're talking about.
[126:17.30]Okay, what do you have?
[126:18.94]Let's take a look at what you have here.
[126:20.04]Well, we have some beautiful pieces here.
[126:21.38]Yeah, take a look.
[126:22.54]See if anything strikes your fancy.
[126:24.36]You do have some pretty cool stuff, actually.
[126:26.77]Got Elvis over here.
[126:27.61]Huh.
[126:30.81]Oh, these coins, too.
[126:32.55]All sorts of coins.
[126:33.55]Wow.
[126:34.11]This is actually really... What about this up here?
[126:35.79]What's this?
[126:41.72]these are our newest arrival beautiful condition we just checked through them and uh take a look and see what you think these are absolutely beautiful they're heavy too they have a weight to them that's uh that's how you can tell that they're real yeah I knew that that's why I said that with you wow these are
[127:02.59]How much are these worth?
[127:03.99]These two pieces right now, we could probably let them go for $50,000.
[127:07.51]That's kind of on the high end.
[127:13.06]That would be quite a steal.
[127:14.36]On the high end, but it's okay.
[127:16.60]I did say that I wanted to invest in gold, though.
[127:18.52]I did mention that a long time ago.
[127:20.60]This would be a great way to get started.
[127:23.42]Would you think so?
[127:24.64]Absolutely.
[127:25.38]Just hang on to these.
[127:26.60]Let them appreciate.
[127:27.44]They smell, too.
[127:29.80]Does gold have a scent?
[127:31.54]Yes, it does.
[127:32.38]Wow.
[127:32.74]That's the scent of gold right there.
[127:34.26]Holy smokes.
[127:35.88]You know what?
[127:36.20]Let me... I'm going to call my guy.
[127:40.56]Come and get an assessment here.
[127:42.45]All over the phone.
[127:43.55]And it's my mom.
[127:46.23]Yeah, they're probably... It's like a pound.
[127:50.05]Yeah, it looks like... It looks good.
[127:54.07]Should I...
[127:58.46]He wouldn't, he wouldn't, no, Ma, he wouldn't take the Yu-Gi-Oh card.
[128:01.60]I know, I know, I told him that.
[128:07.67]Okay, let me, 48?
[128:10.07]You think he'll take 48?
[128:10.59]Okay.
[128:11.95]Alright, yeah, I mean, this guy's a moron.
[128:15.39]He has, he never even played Stardew Valley before, like, I know, seriously.
[128:18.33]Alright, Ma, alright, I love you too.
[128:25.26]Get ahold of your guy?
[128:27.10]That's very hard to reach, my guy, sometimes.
[128:29.80]Did you say your mom?
[128:31.06]Is that right?
[128:31.58]Yeah.
[128:32.48]Well, she knows a lot.
[128:36.90]What did you say?
[128:37.78]Give me the price again one more time.
[128:39.08]$50,000 for these pieces.
[128:40.45]Okay.
[128:41.61]Let me just make sure you know I got it.
[128:44.91]Just so you know.
[128:45.81]Here it is.
[128:47.81]Just so you know, I got it.
[128:49.27]I got it in my hand.
[128:50.01]There it is.
[128:50.79]Well, okay.
[128:52.19]So, this is the part where we do the thing.
[128:57.05]Can you do 38,000?
[128:57.45]If we include all these items, I'd probably be willing to let it go for $49,999.
[129:00.27]$49,999.
[129:00.53]That's like 5% off the first one you said?
[129:02.62]Something like that.
[129:03.36]Yeah.
[129:03.48]How about, can you do...
[129:20.21]Now that it's real, I'm really fucking nervous.
[129:23.05]Can you do 42,000, 44,000, 43,000?
[129:29.42]I mean, these are great pieces.
[129:31.64]The best I could do would be probably $49,998.
[129:36.54]You are.
[129:37.38]You are a tricky one.
[129:41.22]Deal.
[129:41.56]You got it.

[129:49.34]You can count it too.
[129:50.09]You can make sure it's all there.
[129:50.89]It's going to take a little while.
[129:53.41]Yeah.
[129:53.57]You know, it's a step.
[129:55.05]You know what to do with it.
[129:56.05]Yeah.

[130:05.38]I'm going to, I'm going to, should I?
[130:08.38]I turned it back to it?
[130:10.06]Wait, somebody check the price of gold right now.
[130:12.45]See if it went up.
[130:15.58]We went down?
[130:15.98]Alright, let's go.
[130:18.04]Whatever.
[130:18.30]You want to grab my phone?

[130:24.44]Grab my phone.
[130:25.30]Grab my phone.
[130:28.11]Thank you.
[130:30.69]You want to get Burger King?
[130:33.25]Don't use that part because I don't want the people to know I ate it.
[130:57.98]I'm going to call my, I'm going to call my guy and we'll get, I'm going to figure out if you know what the value that is because I'm going to get them in here and we'll, we'll make, you know, like they do on the TV shows.
[131:08.52]Like I wanted you to do so badly, you know, just cut it right here.
[131:11.92]I wanted you so badly to just like call the guy in, like it's good TV.
[131:15.02]I don't know why you don't understand that.
[131:16.44]I would call the guy in if you had brought me these.
[131:17.96]You call the guy in for that.
[131:20.59]Even, I don't care what that is.
[131:22.19]The guy was just here.
[131:23.15]He's the one that evaluated these.
[131:24.41]You just got to bring me something of value.
[131:26.69]He's still in the parking lot?
[131:28.73]Give him that!
