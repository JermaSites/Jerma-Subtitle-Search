[00:04.05]Alright.
[00:05.27]Let's get this on the screen.
[00:11.65]Hey, what are you talking- I played the last Mario Maker.
[00:15.26]I streamed the last Mario Maker, like, on launch.
[00:19.34]What are you on about here?
[00:21.64]Yeah, we'll go through my images too.
[00:22.96]Somebody's asking about it.
[00:24.22]All the screenshots.
[00:24.88]Okay, get that on here.
[00:31.66]We'll do this for like an hour or two.
[00:34.29]Oh, but!
[00:35.43]Um... Yes.
[00:37.79]I want to talk about... the... Somebody's saying delicious.
[00:42.25]I can't speak when things are blowing up in my ears.
[00:45.63]Post the pics on Reddit or Twitter.
[00:47.09]We're just gonna do a little showcase.
[00:50.90]This looks good.
[00:53.14]See, look, I've like already played this game.
[00:54.94]We'll do a new one.
[01:00.08]Maybe you won't hate... Did I hate Mario Maker 1?
[01:05.70]I didn't hate Mario Maker 1, did I?
[01:07.62]I did?
[01:14.98]Alright, let's cook.
[01:21.24]Standard difficulty.
[01:22.32]Yeah, my hands suck.
[01:24.20]My hands are freaking crampy and shitty.
[01:26.14]So I have trouble doing like the... I could probably use a controller too though, couldn't I?
[01:30.70]Should I plug this in?
[01:32.40]I'm going to plug the controller in.
[01:39.96]Well, look, if Mario Maker, if I hate Mario Maker 2, then who cares?
[01:43.72]We can just load up Coke Serve Item Shop tomorrow or whatever.
[01:46.99]I'm in no rush.
[01:51.49]But, I mean, I am in a rush to find the USB cable that goes to this.
[01:57.95]Hold on.
[02:01.92]Where's the fucking USB cable that goes to this?
[02:09.50]Where are all of my things?
[02:13.04]Where are my things?
[02:16.45]Oh, cool.
[02:25.33]Use gamepad.
[02:31.74]Dual, no, it's a three, Xbox One, there it is.
[02:36.48]Alright, here we go.
[02:38.67]This feels pretty good on my hands here.
[02:40.15]Let's cook.
[02:41.23]Standard difficulty.
[02:46.15]So this game is about being quick and serving customers very fast.
[02:49.51]This is your main restaurant serving area.
[02:50.69]It doesn't look like the best, but hey, you'll fix it up in no time.
[02:52.86]You can press the menu button to pause the game at any time during the day.
[02:58.16]To the left is your prep stations.
[03:00.84]You'll start with four.
[03:02.86]will earn more as you gain stars for your restaurant you can take orders and serve food from here let's give it a try highlight prep station one by pressing up on the d-pad and press a this is a customer ticket he wants a corn dog this game gave me anxiety about an old job like fast food preparing food quickly
[03:27.00]Prep Station 1 is highlighted.
[03:27.92]Press right bumper to prep the food on the right side of the screen.
[03:30.86]So we just gotta do ketchup and mustard, right?
[03:37.68]He looks like he wants a corn dog.
[03:39.28]Cursor on screen.
[03:40.26]I'm leaving it.
[03:43.10]You now have the corndog order in front of you.
[03:44.80]The right menu shows which keys to press for what ingredients.
[03:48.83]And the bottom ticket is how the customer wants the food made.
[03:52.05]Once you've done with an order, press LB to serve it to the customer.
[03:55.57]Just ketchup, please.
[03:57.85]That's mustard.
[03:58.89]How do I remove that?
[03:59.96]I thought of... How do I remove that?
[04:02.02]I have to remove that.
[04:02.88]Is there a way I can take that off?
[04:06.44]Well, I fucked up your order.
[04:07.62]Give me three stars on Yelp, dick.
[04:13.96]Okay, right bumper.
[04:15.24]Uh, ketchup and mustard, please.
[04:20.31]More complex food.
[04:22.81]That requires you to cook before serving, and that has you access more ingredients.
[04:26.53]Alright, this is a pizza.
[04:28.53]The nachos have an ingredient that needs to be cooked before preparing the food.
[04:31.03]Highlight prep station one, RB.
[04:34.84]Okay, so I want, so it's ground meat?
[04:38.20]Complete the order on the ticket, then press LB to throw the order back to the left side of the screen to start cooking it.
[04:42.10]Okay.
[04:43.41]To cook it.
[04:44.79]Ground meat is cooking.
[04:45.63]You'll need to wait a few seconds for the meat to grill at the right temperature before serving.
[04:49.61]Once the order turns blue, it's ready to be prepped.
[04:53.14]Select the order too soon or too late, and your customer will have raw or burned meat and will likely have a bad rating.
[05:03.36]The Nocturnals are ready for additional ingredients.
[05:04.80]Highlight Prep Station 1.
[05:05.88]And here we go.
[05:08.25]So, this person's... You will need to hold... You will need to press and hold LT to access the second page of ingredients.
[05:18.17]Release the trigger to go back to the original page of ingredients.
[05:20.06]If needed, be sure to recognize that the left column of ingredients call for the left stick to be flicked in a direction.
[05:25.88]And the right column uses the right stick.
[05:28.54]What do you want?
[05:29.96]Queso Guacamole...
[05:33.63]Okay, so guacamole.
[05:38.77]Beans, rice, and ground meat.
[05:41.48]Beans.
[05:43.46]Rice.
[05:45.00]And ground beef.
[05:47.54]I'm telling you, I can't.
[05:48.86]I can't play this game.
[05:51.36]I have to say everything.
[06:00.23]Beans, beans.
[06:01.11]Onion.
[06:02.13]Onion.
[06:03.81]okay great work you just completed a more advanced order you can always practice more and put your foods in the view by food menu press a alright here we go there are two types of orders that you'll find in cook serve delicious when an order is highlighted blue after cooking it will require additional prep yep when an order is yellow it requires no more prep and is ready to be served to the customer simply select to serve it immediately press a
[06:29.86]You can only prepare one order at a time.
[06:31.47]However, you can serve yellow cooked orders to customers immediately even when preparing a different order.
[06:36.66]Simply highlight the order and press right bumper to serve at any time.
[06:39.56]Press A to continue.
[06:42.08]Customers won't wait around forever and have their food order taken.
[06:44.66]You'll notice that this food is slowly disappearing from the screen.
[06:47.02]If it goes away completely, the customer will leave angrily and will cause bad buzz for your restaurant.
[06:51.81]There are ways of extending customer patience with the equipment menu, which will be unlocked later in the... I have to... I can't... I cannot, like, put on my fake television voice because this is too hard of a game.
[07:00.93]Sorry, guys.
[07:01.61]That's just the way it is.
[07:04.13]Customers won't wait around forever yet, okay?
[07:06.09]There are ways of extending customer patience via the equipment menu, which will be unlocked later in the... Yeah, sure.
[07:13.88]There are also chores to contend with.
[07:16.18]But that's enough tutorials for now.
[07:17.28]You can always select practice chores in the tutorial menu.
[07:20.31]And try out all the chores you need to complete daily.
[07:22.33]Let's go.
[07:22.97]That, you just learned the basics.
[07:24.09]Here we go.
[07:24.55]Open the restaurant.
[07:25.27]Here we go.
[07:26.85]I'm not moving it.
[07:27.51]I was about to move it.
[07:28.15]Yeah, I'll move it.
[07:30.31]Alright, welcome.
[07:31.23]Welcome, welcome.
[07:31.91]This is your main managing menu.
[07:35.51]From here, you can control your food menu, buy new items, and a whole lot more.
[07:38.08]You'll work from 9 to 10 p.m.
[07:40.78]Wait, 9 a.m.
[07:41.04]to 10 p.m.
[07:44.50]Isn't that too long?
[07:47.18]Then between each day, you'll come back to this menu to plan out your business.
[07:51.74]Okay.
[07:53.00]First, when you buy some food to put on your menu, you have a starting budget that should allow you to purchase three to five foods out of the initial 20 that's offered.
[07:59.55]You can do that via the You Buy Foods menu.
[08:02.13]Speaking of
[08:04.22]an amount of things.
[08:06.24]I did want to tell you, so in the beginning of the stream I talked about it a little bit, but I wanted to give just another reiteration of the next couple months.
[08:16.11]So there is going to be on this stream, somewhere before September, the carnival stream.
[08:23.28]There's going to be a carnival on this stream.
[08:26.78]There's going to be a bunch of midway games that you guys are going to play.
[08:32.84]It's not just going to be a dunk tank.
[08:35.12]It's going to be a fucking monumental event with tons of games.
[08:39.90]So the reason why I now have to dial, I just, I have to dial streams back a little bit.
[08:46.49]So four days a week is typically what I would typically do.
[08:52.01]It's probably going to be dialed back to like three.
[08:53.63]I want to make sure I like said that a few times.
[08:57.14]Then this is like as of like next week.
[09:01.08]I don't want to give any spoilers.
[09:03.07]I don't want to give any more information.
[09:05.03]But there's going to be a lot of shit to do.
[09:07.61]So...
[09:10.81]hopefully it's fun but I have the process has started of a company that's now involved that is gonna I may have to do traveling back and forth from this facility a few times so I will there's gonna make sure that you guys gonna know exactly when this is happening you're gonna see probably testing in the chat too
[09:36.75]There's no way that you will miss this if you want to see it because over the next three to five weeks, I'm going to be talking about it all the time.
[09:52.19]SpaceX.
[09:53.71]No.
[09:54.73]Did we get prizes?
[09:56.29]You're just going to have to wait.
[09:57.05]You're going to have to wait and see.
[09:58.59]But this is not just going to be a dunk tank stream.
[10:03.76]Welcome to the carnival.
[10:06.53]That's all I'm going to say.
[10:08.73]I'd rather it be like a fun surprise.
[10:12.06]You'll know the date, but that's pretty much where I want to leave it.
[10:15.52]It's going to be a sub-only stream?
[10:19.02]Why the hell would I do that?
[10:27.02]But there's still going to be a dunk tank.
[10:29.20]Absolutely.
[10:39.59]So just to give you an indication, it's a robotics team.
[10:45.62]So every one of these carnival games is going to be controlled by you guys.
[10:53.85]This is not just like, hey, walk around like a fake carnival.
[10:56.21]You guys control all the games.
[11:00.96]That's the point.
[11:06.94]There is an entire robotics team that is on board with this.
[11:14.43]And it's going to be fucking a ton of fun.
[11:22.59]That's it.
[11:24.45]That's the end of all the information that I'm going to give you.
[11:29.44]It's going to happen before September.
[11:40.73]Oh, fuck, I need to read this.
[11:45.24]Or, like, September-ish.
[11:47.06]I don't really have, like, an exact date yet, but I will have that information over the next couple weeks.
[11:56.41]I will be promoting the shit out of this, so don't worry about... Wait, what more details?
[12:07.21]September 2030?
[12:07.57]No, September 2019.
[12:14.78]I wish I could like talk about more of this and it's something that I'm like so obsessed with this right now but I I'd want I want that at least to be to be like surprising for a lot of the things that we're doing but anyways that's why I have to start to cut streams over the next like two months I am stoked
[12:41.26]Anyways, you'll notice a few foods require a piece of equipment.
[12:43.97]Yeah, I need equipment to do so.
[12:44.99]I remember this stuff.
[12:45.59]You have to buy it.
[12:53.63]Uh, yeah, there's boosters and tractors.
[12:56.31]These are elements of foods that can help or hurt your business by bringing in more customers during the day or run them off entirely, right?
[13:04.46]If you have dirty trash everywhere.
[13:06.32]Yeah.
[13:12.21]Yeah.
[13:14.01]Buzz is vital in keeping customers.
[13:15.21]The higher your buzz, the faster customers will come through the door during the day.
[13:17.75]Perfect orders gain buzz for the next work day.
[13:22.09]Average orders add no buzz and bad orders subtract from your buzz.
[13:27.11]That's true.
[13:29.41]Gotta add the foods to the active menu.
[13:30.97]You can do up to six foods a day.
[13:34.71]Plan out your menu each day to balance out which foods gain the most buzz.
[13:39.03]I'm ready.
[13:42.26]So, let's do... What's the menu we got right now?
[13:46.30]Literally nothing.
[13:48.28]Alright, I want... Pretzel.
[13:52.48]Yeah, I want pretzel.
[13:55.79]Beer.
[13:57.59]Pretzels, beer, and... Fish?
[14:05.09]No, what a terrible restaurant.
[14:06.53]Pretzels, beer, and baked potatoes.
[14:11.24]And a steak.
[14:13.10]Okay, that sounds good.
[14:17.91]So let's do pretzels, beer, baked potato, and steak.
[14:26.09]That's a carb-heavy menu.
[14:27.75]What about equipment?
[14:30.90]Are we good?
[14:32.32]Grill station.
[14:35.46]Deep fryer.
[14:36.14]I don't think I need this.
[14:39.44]Oh, I did.
[14:39.92]I want the tip station.
[14:46.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:47.92]Begin!
[14:50.86]Steak.
[14:51.90]One seasoned, twice juicy, and one serving of citrus.
[14:56.62]Seasoned, juicy, and citrus.
[15:01.91]And then... Oh, fuck.
[15:03.51]Cook it.
[15:06.13]Baked potato is sour cream, bacon, and onions.
[15:08.95]Sour cream, bacon, and onion.
[15:12.61]Serve it.
[15:14.17]That wasn't good?
[15:14.80]What was wrong with it?
[15:17.31]What was wrong with that?
[15:17.95]I don't understand.
[15:19.15]Cheese and sour cream.
[15:20.81]Cheese and sour cream.
[15:23.45]Why do they not like this?
[15:24.15]Oh, fuck.
[15:27.59]The steak, the steak, the steak.
[15:31.54]Okay, hold.
[15:32.06]Pour beer.
[15:37.22]Toilet?
[15:37.70]What do you want from the toilet?
[15:41.66]Did I just wash my hands in the toilet?
[15:44.88]Nothing on it.
[15:45.70]Here.
[15:54.96]Salt and butter, please.
[16:01.90]Rush hour.
[16:08.05]Sanitize, come on!
[16:10.01]Once seasoned, twice juicy, and citrus.
[16:20.66]These controls actually are not very good.
[16:28.61]It's cheese, sour cream, butter.
[16:33.80]Okay.
[16:34.46]Dude, it's the... it's the... I don't like this.
[16:37.90]I'm going back to the keyboard.
[16:39.72]No, I don't like this.
[16:42.08]This is not good.
[16:46.86]It's like you can't use the left analog to move up and down.
[16:49.60]No.
[16:52.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:55.13]Awful.
[16:55.73]No.
[16:56.37]Give me the keyboard.
[17:11.02]Do it!
[17:11.86]Cheese, sour cream, butter.
[17:16.62]Oh shit, I just served that, like, raw.
[17:24.25]Yeah, the- the- the bumpers are just- I can't do it.
[17:27.83]Hitting up and down on the analog, you have to do up and down on the D-pad.
[17:34.85]No, it's fucking with my head.
[17:45.59]Left bumper to serve?
[17:47.92]Shouldn't it be right bumper?
[17:48.84]If it's right bumper to open the menu, why isn't it right bumper to serve the food?
[18:02.27]Season the toilet.
[18:07.21]Sour cream and cheese, please.
[18:13.04]Wait, doesn't it need to cook first?
[18:17.15]Yeah, hold on.
[18:18.29]It needs to steam.
[18:21.71]Cook, serve, delicious with a controller.
[18:23.11]You poor man.
[18:24.21]I know, I know.
[18:25.05]I didn't know.
[18:25.45]I didn't know.
[18:26.09]I didn't know.
[18:28.29]Trees, potatoes, salt, cream, and onion.
[18:43.52]Cinnamon, please.
[18:44.14]That's... I gotta get out of the controller.
[19:14.69]It's nothing.
[19:15.45]What am I to do?
[19:36.82]Pretty good.
[19:49.63]sour cream and onion woah, what was wrong with the steaks?
[20:00.53]what was wrong with the steaks?
[20:11.68]fuck this place
[20:16.53]What was wrong with the stakes?
[20:17.81]What was wrong with the stakes?
[20:20.53]God.
[20:21.61]I know this is a typing game.
[20:22.85]I'm a moron for wanting to use the controller.
[20:25.75]I know this is a typing game and I'm using a... Look.
[20:30.05]It wasn't part of the plan tonight.
[20:42.21]Yeah, it's a typing game.
[20:46.43]This is a long day.
[20:53.71]If only I had... Yeah.
[20:55.07]Unplug the controller.
[20:56.07]I just did.
[20:59.74]That didn't do anything.
[21:00.36]It's still on the controller setting.
[21:01.56]You have to do it in the menu.
[21:03.22]Come on, come on, come on.
[21:13.13]Season three times.
[21:14.95]And one juice.
[21:16.75]No.
[21:17.79]Whatever.
[21:20.95]Cheese and sour cream.
[21:31.00]Jerma's IQ is equal to the temperature of the steaks, the raw-ass steaks that he's serving.
[21:34.48]Well, that's funny, because the internal temperature of a raw steak is usually like 112.
[21:38.36]So, that's pretty good, actually.
[21:39.86]Thanks for the compliment.
[21:42.26]Like 120.
[21:54.97]Alright, I need to change this, because, hold on.
[21:59.65]Save and quit.
[22:01.45]I'm doing the keyboard.
[22:03.71]No, not quit the whole game!
[22:04.99]No, just, like, get to the menu.
[22:06.75]Shit.
[22:08.64]Fuck.
[22:09.62]Fuck.
[22:10.54]Fuck.
[22:11.44]Fuck.
[22:17.12]Nice.
[22:25.68]Enter.
[22:26.22]Here we go.
[22:27.60]Wait, was this the right day?
[22:28.46]I don't know.
[22:31.02]I think so.
[22:33.90]Is this the right day?
[22:34.48]Yeah.
[22:37.42]Okay, career menu.
[22:39.87]Upgrade food.
[22:41.69]Let's up, you know, back to... Corn dogs are easy.
[22:49.83]I need a drink.
[22:50.79]I need drinks.
[22:53.57]Always remain fresh on the active menu.
[22:55.31]It's not going to decline in popularity.
[22:58.68]Customers don't ever tip with this.
[23:02.94]Minus five buzz.
[23:03.94]Trashy food.
[23:05.48]Then it can be taken to go.
[23:06.70]Alright, what about a... A soup?
[23:10.70]This is making me hungry and I'm not even playing.
[23:13.54]I mean, I am playing.
[23:16.74]How about a fish?
[23:20.76]Specialty foods.
[23:22.36]I can't unlock these.
[23:24.64]I gotta buy equipment for that.
[23:25.66]Let's get, like, a grill station.
[23:26.80]I don't have any money.
[23:28.10]Alright, I gotta make this good.
[23:30.14]Active menu.
[23:31.95]Let's go with, uh... Corn dogs are easier.
[23:34.79]I want easy shit.
[23:37.03]Corn dogs.
[23:39.53]Drinks.
[23:40.21]This is just gonna be easy.
[23:42.21]Maybe, like, get the baked potato out of here and put, like, the fish on the menu.
[23:48.10]Why am I pronouncing it soup?
[23:51.12]Pre-recorded.
[23:51.44]What are you talking about?
[23:53.36]Oh, oh, because pre-recorded, right.
[23:56.28]Alright, so we got... Catering, Simple Food, Afternoon Delight.
[24:03.18]Yeah, that's alright.
[24:05.22]Alright, let's go.
[24:08.49]Alright!
[24:09.37]Crack my knuckles, and here we go.
[24:16.13]Hold, is it... Enter to serve?
[24:20.89]Am I doing that wrong?
[24:22.17]It's just 1, 2, 3, 4, right?
[24:24.51]You don't even use the mouse for this game.
[24:27.13]So, fillet the fish, then season and cook.
[24:33.32]That's so much easier.
[24:35.76]Get beer at 8am, yeah.
[24:39.00]Just ketchup, please.
[24:53.11]Large cola with ice, please.
[24:55.97]A large cola with ice.
[25:01.80]I?
[25:02.74]Did I do it?
[25:03.70]Yeah.
[25:04.92]A medium cola with ice, please.
[25:13.35]Soda machines are gross.
[25:17.41]Well... I mean, if they're clean and they're taken care of, they're not.
[25:25.73]Who puts ice in after the drink?
[25:28.23]I do that.
[25:32.93]What's wrong with putting ice in after?
[25:34.17]That's fucked up?
[25:47.13]Is it?
[25:47.37]A large T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. With ice?
[25:51.67]Ice!
[25:53.25]Two!
[25:56.16]Four, uh, large tea with ice.
[25:58.24]Oh, that's a cola.
[25:59.96]Dump it!
[26:00.32]How do I dump it?
[26:01.32]Can I dump it?
[26:01.88]Whatever, that's what you get.
[26:03.04]Fuck.
[26:04.46]A large diet ice.
[26:05.62]That's just, that's just water.
[26:09.64]I can't.
[26:12.39]It's too stressful.
[26:23.05]Uh, medium tea with ice, please.
[26:32.49]Diet ice.
[26:39.96]Ketchup and mustard, please.
[26:40.98]There you go.
[26:42.49]Clean the toilet.
[26:45.67]Small water with ice, please.
[26:59.32]I meant ice at a soda machine, not at home.
[27:03.62]Oh my god, I pressed 2!
[27:10.41]I'm do- I got such bad buzz, too.
[27:12.11]There's a rat?
[27:16.84]What's this?
[27:30.76]This lady looks like not happy about this restaurant at all.
[27:35.69]Large cola with ice.
[27:40.11]Sanitize the cheese.
[27:42.37]Just ketchup.
[27:46.59]I'm gonna give myself a swirly and then go back to work.
[28:14.51]Mop the tables?
[28:15.27]I don't have an option to do that, do I?
[28:20.88]I have no fucking money.
[28:28.58]I can't fucking believe I did it again.
[28:30.02]Whatever.
[28:36.22]Everybody that wants a drink.
[28:37.42]This is like your parents when everything was Nintendo.
[28:42.28]Are you in there playing Nintendo?
[28:43.70]It's a PlayStation.
[28:44.38]Oh, he really likes his Nintendo.
[28:46.96]You're on like your computer.
[28:49.38]Everything is Coke.
[28:50.32]Everything is Coke.
[28:51.85]A medium diet with ice.
[28:52.97]A medium diet with ice.
[28:57.99]medium... a small grape with ice.
[29:05.33]Quack, quack, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[29:10.33]Shit!
[29:26.79]Rush Hour again?
[29:27.61]No.
[29:28.79]Just lost a... Yeah, I don't know if people call Diet Coke a diet.
[29:36.54]No, they don't.
[29:44.70]You can serve finished orders while you are in a different order.
[29:48.38]You can?
[29:50.24]That's pretty cool.
[29:50.88]I didn't know that.
[29:57.63]Not just mustard.
[29:58.27]What's with all these mustard people?
[30:02.21]I've seen no ketchup.
[30:06.57]Large grape with ice.
[30:16.22]Take that.
[30:21.44]Mustard only is the best corndog.
[30:23.20]I mean, it's alright.
[30:38.23]Mustard's superior to ketchup.
[30:41.05]I mean, I think they both have their place.
[30:45.01]So if you have... Hold on, we're closed.
[30:48.56]Get out of here.
[30:52.76]Ketchup is really good on, for instance, french fries.
[30:56.26]Ketchup is better on french fries than mustard is on french fries.
[31:00.03]You don't do that.
[31:03.03]And if you do, then what are you doing?
[31:10.09]Okay.
[31:12.15]Ketchup is way more unhealthy.
[31:17.05]How is ketchup more unhealthy than mustard?
[31:19.19]They're both fucking puke condiments that come out of a processed factory.
[31:25.51]They both have a bunch of, like, dog shit in them.
[31:37.88]Ooh, better beer?
[31:41.98]Upgrade includes the replacement of Hop's Classic Brew to the Hop's Classic American Brew.
[31:46.34]I'll take it.
[31:46.74]I don't have any money.
[31:53.51]Uh, no, no, no.
[31:54.87]New menu.
[31:55.43]Something... We need to get some, like, actual foods on here.
[31:58.85]I need some, like, high income.
[32:04.31]Beer is always popular.
[32:05.81]That's all we have.
[32:06.39]We don't have any... We have beer.
[32:09.75]Fuck the drinks.
[32:13.86]Yeah, we serve beer.
[32:19.56]Just be a bar.
[32:20.45]Alright, SCJ.
[32:28.09]Season three times.
[32:30.57]And one juice.
[32:31.25]Alright, I gotta be on top of this.
[32:38.08]French fries with mayo?
[32:38.82]That's pretty good, actually.
[32:39.54]I like that.
[32:41.00]I actually do like french fries with mayonnaise.
[32:44.73]It's actually very good.
[32:47.64]It is.
[32:56.95]It's not bad.
[33:01.47]If you've never had it before, that you... Look, I know it... For some reason, mayo has this weird, incredibly polarized opinion that a lot of people have.
[33:12.66]You either think mayonnaise is disgusting, unedible garbage, or you like it.
[33:19.42]There's no in-between.
[33:28.09]Mayo is salty jello.
[33:31.42]No, it's not.
[33:32.66]Jell-O sucks.
[33:33.98]I just had to eat a shitload of Jell-O, and it's not even close.
[33:38.49]If I was allowed to eat mayonnaise out of the jar, I probably would've.
[33:41.37]If I could've.
[33:42.51]That would be better than eating a Jell-O.
[33:47.79]Season three times, and then one juice.
[33:52.50]Yeah, Jell-O sucks.
[33:53.50]It's horrible.
[34:06.41]Guys, Jello is seriously like somebody... I mean, this is gonna be gross.
[34:09.43]And I apologize to anybody that doesn't like to hear gross things.
[34:12.79]But Jello is somebody spitting a cold loogie down your throat.
[34:17.98]Disgusting.
[34:18.72]I don't want it.
[34:19.28]I never want it again.
[34:25.30]Season one, two, three.
[34:29.86]Season once, and then two juicy ones, and then... Got it!
[34:41.69]I just saw the chat rocket by after I said that.
[34:54.90]Wait, wait, hold on.
[34:55.28]Somebody said jelly.
[34:56.96]Jelly is not the same as jello.
[34:59.46]I don't know where you get... No, that's not my opinion.
[35:04.76]Jello is not jelly.
[35:07.05]They're very different.
[35:10.34]Jelly is good.
[35:11.52]Jelly and jam, that's fine.
[35:13.20]Jello?
[35:15.08]Gross.
[35:21.84]Do I need to pause the game to talk about this?
[35:26.08]The stuff that you dump from the box and add hot water to and stuff it in your fridge for two hours is not the same as the jam that you buy, like, preserves.
[35:51.01]I- I don't- I don't understand what- what's happening here.
[35:54.31]What are you guys- No!
[35:55.84]Jello!
[35:57.18]Like, Jello, the- the fucking sand you dump in the water is not the same thing as buying, like, jam!
[36:04.70]What are you- What?!
[36:10.06]I'll fight you all day on this one.
[36:17.02]It's the same ingredients.
[36:18.16]It's processed differently.
[36:19.08]It's not the same.
[36:23.11]There's no real fucking fruit in jello.
[36:26.07]I can't...
[36:44.88]Jello is a gelatin that is sold in powdered form and you have to add it in water and heat and then allow it to cool down to set and take the shape of jelly.
[36:53.45]Jelly and jello are practically the same thing, with jello being a brand name sold in the United States.
[36:59.16]All jello is jelly, but not all jelly is jello.
[37:01.82]Fucking give me a break.
[37:04.78]It's not the same.
[37:06.10]It's not the same.
[37:07.44]I've had jelly, like the yellow fucking booger jello is not the same as getting strawberry preserves from the grocery store.
[37:19.85]That is not even close.
[37:22.33]One of them is disgusting and one of them is kind of good.
[37:29.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:41.13]Okay, smuckers, strawberry jam, strawberry preserves.
[37:46.24]It's just you cook strawberries and lemon juice in a saucepan.
[37:51.54]And you do that for 40 minutes and you Ster in sugar.
[37:57.31]It's not powdered bones.
[37:59.47]It's not bones.
[38:13.79]Jelly.
[38:14.21]I'm looking.
[38:14.65]Jelly.
[38:15.83]Jelly.
[38:16.95]A clear or translucent fruit spread or preserve referred to as jelly in Canada and other countries.
[38:23.87]Jelly.
[38:24.78]Fruit preserves.
[38:26.26]Jelly.
[38:27.18]Fruit preserves.
[38:28.54]Fruit preserves.
[38:29.70]Jelly.
[38:31.28]Fruit preserves.
[38:31.92]There it is.
[38:51.27]Jelly is bones.
[38:52.67]It's not bones.
[38:56.56]Alright, I'm fucking outta here.
[38:58.16]I'm outta here!
[39:07.90]Jelly is bones.
[39:08.90]If I- Oh, somebody says jelly is bones one more time.
[39:13.83]I am going to fucking scream.
[39:16.39]Hold on, I have to pay attention.
[39:20.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:30.30]I gave that guy an empty glass.
[39:34.04]Hey, can I get a beer?
[39:35.12]Sure.
[39:35.42]Here's an empty cup.
[39:50.39]I didn't even attempt to put alcohol in there.
[40:00.64]I can't fucking believe people are putting, like... No, I can't even believe it.
[40:14.04]Oh, jello sucks.
[40:33.18]What happened?
[40:33.58]Whoa, I got a picture.
[40:34.66]Give the picture.
[40:36.17]Sure.
[40:39.69]You put jello on your french fries.
[40:42.43]I mean... No.
[40:46.64]Don't do that.
[40:48.84]Somehow I, like, all my windows are down.
[40:52.58]How do I close all these windows?
[40:57.91]Cinnamon.
[40:59.41]Cinnamon on a pretzel?
[41:03.21]mayo is okay mayo is good I will ever I will convert all of you here very very easily you want to love the you want to love mayo I'll tell you how you just have to put it on a fresh crispy chicken sandwich fuck what time is it I have to I'm going to get food
[41:31.87]We're talking about like a nice, thin, crispy patty with one, with one sleeve of lettuce and then a nice slab of mayonnaise and maybe one pickle.
[41:44.56]But don't put the pickle on there.
[41:46.12]Don't mess it up.
[41:55.16]Seriously.
[41:56.54]Trust me on that.
[42:03.29]10% positive buzz, that's pretty good.
[42:04.55]What do I got?
[42:05.17]700 bucks?
[42:05.55]I need a... I need, like, a grill or something.
[42:09.56]What can I buy?
[42:10.10]I need, like, a fryer.
[42:13.28]Is this a lasagna?
[42:14.74]I don't even get me started on lasagna.
[42:20.22]Sure.
[42:23.23]We had lasagna conversations not that long ago, actually.
[42:27.77]Mayo is salty jello.
[42:28.93]Prove me wrong.
[42:29.73]First of all, mayonnaise is oil and eggs.
[42:32.87]It is not powdered bones.
[42:35.83]And neither is jam.
[42:37.07]Neither is jelly.
[42:38.05]Fucking jello.
[43:00.01]Alright, lasagna, beer... Here.
[43:03.43]No, no more beer.
[43:05.19]Lasagna... Let's do Italian.
[43:08.30]Lasagna, pretzels, baked potatoes.

[43:51.45]What?
[43:53.71]Shit!
[43:59.80]It doesn't, you just need to sprinkle it on anyways.
[44:02.70]Parmesan just goes on top anyways, who cares?
[44:06.67]Medium water with ice.
[44:21.62]One of my opinions on marmalade.
[44:25.38]I'm not sure if I've ever really had marmalade before.
[44:27.86]I don't think so.

[53:56.48]Sometimes I bring in a paper.
[54:03.40]65 equals old?
[54:04.18]Yeah, that's when you get your senior discount.
[54:07.67]I classify that as old.
[54:18.69]Old people just wander around looking for shit to do.
[54:20.83]I don't know why I think that's so funny.
[54:28.61]Just, like, walking around...
[54:31.84]Guess I'll go get a large coke at Denny's and then leave.
[54:36.62]I guess.
[54:43.07]Don't we all?
[54:43.73]I mean, I kind of, I look forward to that, though.
[54:46.57]You guys don't look forward to that?
[54:59.44]No.
[55:01.86]You don't look forward just to kind of like open up your door and like walking around in a circle?
[55:06.06]And ending up at Denny's?
[55:08.02]Why?
[55:08.20]That would be kind of fun.
[55:32.28]Let's drink a large tea with ice, please.
[55:36.00]We got it.
[55:52.31]Damn it, I tried to press that.
[55:55.92]I tried to press fucking... You know what I tried to do.
[56:04.93]It flashed me in the face and it fucked me up.
[56:06.57]I think that was the combo.
[56:12.42]God damn it.
[56:19.13]I got flashed right in the face.
[56:35.51]Large cola with ice.
[56:38.17]I'm making some money, though.
[56:44.34]Wait, what?
[56:46.92]This game looks hard.
[56:47.84]It's a test of reflexes, that's for sure.
[56:54.20]And memorization under pressure.
[56:58.32]It's pretty fun.
[57:05.10]Medium cola with no ice.
[57:08.77]Play Cook, Serve Delicious 2?
[57:11.47]Yeah, this is like just a game, it's kind of like a Picross, where we can just kind of hang out and just talk shit about how jam is not jello, and how jelly is not jam, and jelly is not jello, and jello is gross.
[57:22.56]These are the kinds of streams we can have those conversations on.
[57:28.66]Alright, 20 days of service, not quite there.
[57:30.35]Make $100 in tips.
[57:34.94]I gotta get something new.

[58:17.09]We'll do french fries.
[58:18.71]How much is french fries?

[59:09.74]Easy, cheap, and shitty.
[59:11.29]Yeah, but it's gonna make my buzz increase.
[59:19.55]I just want people to talk about my restaurant.
[59:27.26]Cinnamon.
[59:27.60]Cinnamon.
[59:37.18]Come on, it sucks.
[59:43.92]I'll screw that up.
[59:44.74]I want to make sure it's perfect.
[59:52.77]How is Jerma seeing over the counter?
[60:19.06]I'm not talking for the rest of this room.
[60:40.88]Don't screw it up.
[60:41.50]I want to get to like x20.
[60:50.49]Good.
[60:50.97]Getting tips.
[60:59.14]Cheap and easy.
[61:02.16]We're going for tips.
[61:06.62]We're almost at the Moab.
[61:21.45]22.
[61:32.57]I don't know what's going on, but minus 2.
[61:34.41]What the fuck?
[61:41.39]It's not fair.
[61:42.89]It's not fair.
[61:53.11]I hate this one because you can't do it fast.
[62:03.19]This is a Star Wars theme song.
[62:05.46]This is the thing that they play in the Star Wars bar.
[62:14.42]That's the cantina, yeah.
[62:32.88]Can I do my age in combos here?
[62:41.13]There you go, there you go, there you go.
[62:56.18]62 combo, no.
[63:03.27]I'm almost there.
[63:03.91]Uh oh.
[63:12.55]Slow down, don't go crazy.
[63:17.14]They're wasting a lot of the fish.
[63:19.78]You're getting one fillet out of an entire fish?
[63:22.94]Seems wasteful.
[63:24.84]Make a stew.
[63:43.00]Come on.
[63:43.92]40.
[63:48.70]Am I doing a special stream for my 80th birthday?
[63:52.36]I don't think Twitch is going to be a website when I'm 80.
[63:54.16]You know what I'm saying?
[63:58.76]I don't think... Do you think this shit is still going to be around?
[64:14.64]You guys shouldn't be worried about what I'm gonna stream when I'm 80 and what's gonna happen when the volcanoes erupt.
[64:20.54]In like 50 years, you know what I'm saying?
[64:22.65]What I'm streaming is not really that important.
[64:28.69]Ooh, picture!
[64:35.76]Yes, it is!
[64:47.30]What was it?
[65:01.63]Times 50.
[65:03.25]50!
[65:03.27]50 orders!
[65:03.67]Perfect!
[65:04.95]I did it.
[65:05.77]That's gotta be some kind of record.
[65:12.53]We've left chips in our head and your thoughts will go straight into our brains.
[65:17.90]That's so scary.
[65:24.71]Perfect.
[65:26.11]Lots of positive buzz.
[65:27.87]Two rats, six dishes washed.
[65:31.25]That should be a decent amount of... No, it's not at all.
[65:33.99]It's only 400 bucks.
[65:35.11]How much is the... It's just 800 bucks.
[65:41.74]Any bonuses today?
[65:48.79]Is this a bonus?
[65:53.06]Yeah, there's negative things on here.
[65:56.74]What's the problem here?
[66:04.97]Any more greens?
[66:08.93]Buy new food?
[66:09.79]I can't... All I can... I can't afford anything.
[66:18.22]Why would it be 1200 bucks to make a salad?
[66:25.98]Ice cream upgrade is now available.
[66:29.34]Crazy Dave's initial bet.
[66:33.24]You're a pretty darn good cook, I'll tell you that, but I bet you're not as good as you think.
[66:36.42]My name's Crazy Dave, and I love me some gambling.
[66:38.84]And there's no better way to earn some fast cash than putting up a few bets against your skills as a cook.
[66:43.17]I'll take your $300 today and see how you do.
[66:45.03]You win the bet, I'll give you $600 tomorrow.
[66:47.65]I bet you that today you can't make $15 per... You're paid fine for the... This is just Monopoly chance cards.
[67:01.12]I just got $200.
[67:05.34]I can't believe you managed to serve every single order perfectly yesterday with no missed chores to boot.
[67:12.90]Menu rot is occurring.
[67:19.43]Oh, shit.
[67:20.65]New item.
[67:22.91]Inspection passed.
[67:24.11]Total 10% buzz.
[67:26.03]Menu rot.
[67:27.57]String cheese.
[67:32.17]Alright, let's get some french fries.
[67:39.59]Alright.
[67:40.47]So, active menu.
[67:43.88]Let's get the french fries on here.
[67:44.94]We're going to be a little bit of a bar.
[67:50.03]Menu rot.
[67:50.93]What should I put up there instead?
[67:52.49]Steak?
[67:54.21]Lasagna.
[67:57.39]Sounds good.
[68:00.76]Alright, 15 perfect orders in a row.
[68:08.76]After that, don't matter.
[68:10.54]Why don't I just get all of them in a row?
[68:19.17]Lasagna and french fries?
[68:20.17]French fries actually go with a lot of stuff.
[68:28.32]Putting french fries in a gyro?
[68:30.22]Or in a burrito?
[68:34.50]You ever have like a steak burrito with french fries in it?
[68:36.54]You're missing out.
[68:45.80]We already went over this a thousand... Euro... Euro... Giro... Gyro... Everybody had... You know how many people say it differently?
[68:58.04]Doesn't matter.
[68:58.34]You call up any restaurant you want.
[68:59.50]They'll say it differently.
[69:03.30]Yes!
[69:05.61]Look!
[69:07.07]What am I supposed to say?
[69:08.17]I'm working here!
[69:13.47]I've been told it's... Euro.
[69:18.23]Like, gyro.
[69:22.91]But there was a Greek place that was right down the street from me.
[69:25.97]And the guy said gyro every time.
[69:32.25]And he was from Greece.
[69:34.07]I don't know.
[69:35.53]Hold on, wait.
[69:35.99]Hold on.
[69:38.66]I gotta hold on.
[69:48.82]Almost there.
[69:50.06]Small water with ice.
[69:59.37]Come on, hurry the fuck up.
[70:03.27]Fifteen, got it.
[70:11.54]What is it?
[70:15.12]Large cold with no ice, please.
[70:25.80]you can serve orders while you're in prep yeah but my um my tiny like crow-sized brain can only do one thing at a time
[71:00.31]Crows are smart, though.
[71:01.87]And?
[71:04.17]Where were you going with that one?
[71:06.45]What would you say I would be for an animal, then?
[71:09.41]If you guys were to say what kind of animal I would be.
[71:14.62]You're more of a pigeon.
[71:15.36]I don't know how to do this.
[71:16.02]Is it done?
[71:31.96]You're a snail.
[71:46.21]He's a weasel?
[71:46.79]I don't know about that.
[71:57.37]Two, three, four, it's like four seconds.
[72:02.61]With a salt.
[72:05.15]Is it a salt or is it more than one salt?
[72:09.09]Small grape with ice.
[72:13.64]Squirrel, ferret... Oh, fuck.
[72:24.60]I think I was thinking, like, orc.
[72:31.64]Like, strong and cool and big and... Orc is not an animal, right?
[72:47.91]Orc's not a lizard?
[72:49.73]Okay.
[73:08.09]You're gonna make me fuck this up.
[73:12.07]Where's the one that's not done?
[73:17.49]Thumbs up.
[73:28.00]Large tea with ice, please.
[73:29.16]You got it.
[73:34.57]Two.
[73:35.41]Three.
[73:36.35]Four.
[73:37.85]No salt.
[73:38.59]You got it?
[73:47.70]Is there a date for the next green screen stream?
[73:49.46]Saturday.
[73:50.08]This Saturday.
[73:53.14]It is the encore presentation.
[73:55.14]I will shout it out again.
[73:56.14]I will give you the link again.
[73:57.26]If you have a submission, one submission per person, not every submission is going to be taken.
[74:01.79]We are going to condense them down by a lot because I don't want to have a six hour long green screen stream.
[74:10.43]This is just an encore presentation with what we're going to try to pull in some of the high quality posts.
[74:27.27]Almost reached the age?
[74:28.73]I was already there.
[74:34.67]Why would salt not be S?
[74:37.40]Doesn't seem weird.
[74:46.60]Cook, serve delicious.
[74:50.46]A new item is now available.
[74:52.98]Garbage service is now available.

[75:27.99]I think I want to upgrade something.
[75:31.23]Better beer?
[75:32.33]Yeah, better beer.
[75:36.85]Let's go to equipment.
[75:40.19]I want a grill station.
[75:45.08]So we got better beer now.
[75:51.28]Coin dogs, fish, steak.
[75:55.86]fish steak steak specialty foods alright let's is there anybody no uh nobody got any money I can make here I guess not let's go got better beer now

[77:02.46]No salt.
[77:07.70]Steak should always be well done.
[77:11.14]I disagree.
[77:15.99]I like steak medium to medium well.
[77:22.35]Well done steak.
[77:23.85]I think actually is alright when it's in a... I can't talk and do that one.
[77:30.06]When it's in a sandwich, if you get, for instance, like a steak and cheese sandwich, I want that steak to be well done.
[77:38.65]Medium to medium well.
[77:41.13]Because some people at restaurants, medium well is actually medium, and their medium is medium rare.
[77:47.09]So, no.
[77:48.21]Oh god, hold on.
[78:11.87]Uh, medium diet with ice.
[78:16.48]Got it.
[78:29.11]Oh, what is it?
[78:47.70]Sick, nice.
[78:50.26]Chicken's better than steak.
[78:52.47]I actually like poultry better than red meat, so I agree with you.
[79:05.98]I like poultry and seafood more than I like red meat, like beef.
[79:11.90]And pork.
[79:22.97]Depends on what you feel like.
[79:24.07]Yeah, no, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[79:27.37]There's plenty of opportunities where I'd like a great piece of meat, steak.
[79:33.96]I don't do it that often, though.
[79:36.10]I probably eat steak two or three times a year.
[79:40.35]Maybe less than that.
[79:51.81]Oh, season one, two juicy and one citrus.
[79:54.76]You got it.
[80:01.20]But chicken and turkey?
[80:02.94]Chicken, turkey, and all kinds of seafood I eat pretty much all week.
[80:14.82]Tuna, salmon, sardines, fatty fish.
[80:22.44]Lots of turkey.
[80:23.20]Lots of chicken.
[80:30.17]Crab.
[80:30.77]I love crab.
[80:32.49]Crab is one of my favorite things ever.
[80:34.87]Small water with ice.
[80:46.11]Come on, come on, come on.
[80:47.67]Three, one juice.
[80:48.83]Here we go.
[80:49.43]Medium cold with ice.
[80:54.62]Not bad.
[80:55.08]I'm getting the hang of this game.
[81:08.13]Rat.
[81:19.66]Toilet flush.
[81:20.80]Before somebody reach into their glass.
[81:37.55]Fuckin' no!
[81:38.77]Fuckin' no!
[81:39.53]No!
[81:40.09]No!
[81:48.08]Fuckin' no!
[81:52.80]I didn't... Oh my god.
[81:58.23]It's alright.
[82:07.01]It's alright.
[82:07.71]I got so into that.
[82:10.39]That was like getting hit by a bus.
[82:16.53]No, no, no!
[82:17.57]Mommy, I don't wanna go!
[82:19.81]Mommy!
[82:20.35]This guy is a psycho.
[82:27.39]Whatever.
[82:36.73]No, mommy, I don't want to go.
[82:38.35]No.
[82:46.23]Is the restaurant in a skyscraper or on a hill?
[82:49.27]Probably in a skyscraper.
[82:52.08]It's probably like a hotel restaurant.
[82:54.38]I don't know.
[83:01.20]Got it.
[83:01.42]The second it happened.
[83:06.60]Alright, that's fine.
[83:07.68]I need some new items.
[83:08.88]I need something else on here.
[83:14.90]Pat Resticide.
[83:17.97]Rat Pesticide.
[83:20.55]We're watching you, Dylan.
[83:21.43]Keep these tickets safe.
[83:23.11]I got two mysterious tickets.
[83:26.88]Okay.
[83:29.66]It's gonna be raining.
[83:32.01]Those working in larger structures such as Shura Soda should consider staying indoors.
[83:37.02]Okay, so it's rainy outside, so it's not a nice day.
[83:40.02]Menu rot is occurring.
[83:44.06]Let's go to the active menu.
[83:46.34]I'll get this off.
[83:47.88]Everyone wants to be inside, so... I mean, what do we get?
[83:53.59]Like indoor quality food, maybe?
[83:55.79]Indoor quality?
[84:02.71]Yeah, that one has indoor quality on it.
[84:05.60]Big potato, indoor quality.
[84:06.90]Alright.
[84:11.84]No rot, right?
[84:17.64]Buy foods.
[84:18.22]Where do we go?
[84:18.66]No, I want equipment.
[84:21.85]I want the grill, because I want burgers.
[84:24.43]Eventually here.
[84:25.63]Let's go.
[84:30.55]Oh fuck.
[84:31.37]Oh my god, what- I knocked it off and I can't see the screen.
[84:35.40]It's alright.
[84:36.04]Just the first customer, who cares.
[84:48.91]This guy is a psycho.
[84:56.33]So I'll get more money for this, right?
[85:00.80]Oh no, it's a baked potato.
[85:02.08]I'm terrible at these.
[85:11.43]Just butter.
[85:12.39]H is butter?
[85:12.95]Why?
[85:17.38]I hate the baked potatoes.
[85:18.32]They could be anything.
[85:29.13]I'm so hungry now.
[85:30.05]What am I gonna eat?
[85:30.95]First thing somebody says, I don't care what it is.
[85:32.43]I don't care if it's, like, out of the trash can, whatever it is.
[85:34.43]Doesn't matter what it is, I'm gonna eat it.
[85:36.45]Like, you say, eat literal trash, and I'll do it.
[85:40.05]Dirt.
[85:40.59]Fuck.
[85:44.87]That was quick.
[85:55.64]I can't play these games with you guys, man.
[86:02.54]Butter, chives, bacon.
[86:03.94]Butter, chives, bacon.
[86:05.58]Butter.
[86:05.86]Where's chives?
[86:06.78]H. Where's chives?
[86:07.98]Bacon.
[86:08.42]Butter is... Why?
[86:13.19]Small water with ice.
[86:19.85]Large water with ice.
[86:23.89]Trash.
[86:38.57]I tried to press the toilet!
[86:40.51]This is why I have to look at my hands whenever I use the computer!
[86:44.88]Because my fingers just glide!
[87:01.80]They glide into the toilet, that's right.
[87:06.79]Do a keyboard cam?
[87:10.39]Maybe if I have a Cook, Serve, Delicious tool, I'll do that.
[87:16.47]My hands are like really inflamed today.
[87:17.96]Uh, no, I don't want you to look at my hands.
[87:35.39]Show us.
[87:35.89]No, my hands are inflamed.
[87:38.21]I got like a cut on my hand.
[87:39.73]And I'm an idiot.
[87:41.44]Cheese, sour cream, butter.
[87:42.20]Butter is Y. Cheese is C. Sour cream is S. There we go.
[87:59.41]Am I wearing the ripped green shirt?
[88:00.84]No, I'm wearing a tank top, because it is like 100.
[88:03.96]It's been like 95 to 100 plus in Vegas these last few days.
[88:11.13]It's only going to get hotter.
[88:12.05]It's going to be like 115 in the next month or two, probably.
[88:17.41]Fahrenheit.
[88:20.15]Gets hot here.
[88:30.53]Baked potato?
[88:32.15]That's what my grandma used to say.
[88:35.59]What, you want to get a baked potato?
[88:38.97]Sounds good to me, Grandma.
[88:40.62]Okay.
[88:51.79]Twice juicy.
[88:54.13]One seasoned, twice juicy, one citrus.
[88:57.00]Sour cream and cheese, please.
[88:58.64]That's... That.
[89:00.56]A large cola with ice.
[89:01.64]You got it.
[89:02.20]Throw it in there.
[89:03.32]A beer.
[89:03.80]Come on.
[89:12.48]Come on, do it.
[89:15.92]What are you doing?
[89:16.77]I'm eating tea with ice.
[89:28.58]Um, once.
[89:29.84]Twice juicy.
[89:30.56]Seasoned.
[89:32.30]Serve it up.
[89:32.72]Just butter.
[89:33.26]It's why.
[89:33.76]Get it out there.
[89:34.26]One.
[89:41.84]Probably two.
[89:44.16]Rush hour is over.
[89:45.04]Good.
[89:53.89]Nothing on it.
[89:54.53]You were easy.
[89:55.11]Thank you.
[89:58.30]I missed a citrus?
[90:00.42]When did I do that?
[90:05.76]He can't re-chat during rush hour.
[90:07.28]His orc brain is too focused.
[90:09.44]How would I ever re-chat and do this though?
[90:12.08]That doesn't make any sense.
[90:13.06]Sour cream, chives, and onion.
[90:21.95]It's impossible what you're describing.
[90:33.34]Somebody just said Taco Bell.
[90:34.14]I don't think I want that.
[90:34.94]I mean, does that count?
[90:35.84]Somebody said dirt?
[90:36.80]That counts.
[90:40.97]I will absolutely be eating dirt if I go to Taco Bell.
[90:43.13]So, like, stop slandering companies!
[90:46.17]No, what I meant to say was... What I meant to say was... I, um... There... Like, if I would have...
[91:01.17]It's a good restaurant, and there was nothing... Because, because, because, if I were to go to one of those restaurants, and the employee there was being a jerk to me, which they would never do that at an establishment like that, but if they did, then maybe... Oh, no, a friend of mine was in the front seat, and I ordered a delicious...
[91:25.25]perfect 10 out of 10 fantastic, crispy, juicy taco from this restaurant.
[91:31.13]And I get out, I get out and go to the bathroom.
[91:33.21]I gotta go, like, take a piss.
[91:34.56]And a friend of mine takes dirt and, like, stuffs it in the taco being, like, a dick and thinks he's funny and he starts to get his camera and starts recording.
[91:41.54]And I come back and I take a bite and I'm like, what the, there's dirt in here!
[91:43.32]And he's like, yeah, I got you!
[91:44.38]And it gets uploaded.
[91:45.74]That, that's what I'm referring to.
[91:56.33]Robberies.
[92:02.74]Criminal activity.
[92:06.26]Is there a crime food?
[92:21.30]It's time for your five-day inspection.
[92:22.70]An inspector will come to your restaurant a few times today for an hour or so and observe how quickly you respond to chores.
[92:28.09]Yeah.
[92:29.89]Don't worry, I got it under control.
[92:31.15]So I got some money.
[92:33.79]Let's go to buy foods.
[92:38.44]Let me find... Nachos?
[92:40.98]Pizza?
[92:41.28]I don't have enough.
[92:49.81]How much is a burger?
[92:52.15]1200 bucks.
[92:54.49]Ice cream is 750.
[92:55.61]Why is this stuff so expensive to unlock?
[93:02.46]Any bonuses today?
[93:03.28]Yeah, where's like the crime one?
[93:11.87]This shit's rotting.
[93:12.71]Get it off.
[93:14.60]Uh, I'm gonna say put french fries back on.
[93:17.46]Get the baked potato out of here.
[93:18.40]Add the pretzel.
[93:19.84]Get rid of the drinks.
[93:20.54]No, keep the drinks.
[93:21.85]No, get rid of the... Add corn dog.
[93:25.99]Alright.
[93:29.71]I don't know what... I don't understand the whole crime thing.
[93:31.57]What the crime food is.
[93:44.38]You got beer and that's it.
[93:46.44]Well.
[93:48.68]Oh well.
[93:58.15]I'm... You gonna order something or what?
[94:01.87]What are you just standing there for, you fucking dummy?
[94:08.15]Order something!
[94:10.97]Hey, stupid!
[94:14.52]Oh, that's the inspector.
[94:15.66]Hi, how are you?
[94:17.16]Why are you in a hard hat?
[94:23.01]Is the ceiling gonna fucking collapse?
[94:27.25]Alright, bye.
[94:37.39]What?
[94:38.19]The person was just sitting there staring at me.
[94:39.67]I thought the person just had a hard hat on.
[94:44.42]A health inspector has, like, glasses, like, a suit.
[94:49.50]I'm, like, super generalizing health inspectors right now.
[95:05.05]It wasn't... It's a safety inspector.
[95:07.56]Right, okay, never mind.
[95:08.66]That's why I was confused.
[95:14.76]She was in the email?
[95:17.47]Oh.
[95:18.05]I don't know, I just brought- I just skimmed my emails.
[95:21.35]Ugh, that's funny.
[95:44.89]I'm laughing because somebody said, I have 100 days perfect in a row.
[95:47.73]How many do you have?
[96:03.57]Fill it up.
[96:10.42]Give me a chore to do.
[96:11.06]I'll do it right away.
[96:17.71]So this person doesn't care if I sneeze into the beer, they care about if I drop the beer and I don't pick up the glass off the ground.
[96:24.35]Right?
[96:26.01]So we're good.
[96:39.56]She's just browsing.
[96:50.55]My other monitor has these beautiful, brilliant photos on it.
[96:53.61]I can't wait till we go through those.
[97:04.57]See?
[97:05.97]I did it really fast.
[97:08.97]And I didn't wash my hands.
[97:10.37]And I gave this old guy a corn dog.
[97:14.04]That I microwaved.
[97:15.84]I actually went to the supermarket and bought frozen corn dogs.
[97:18.44]I don't make those.
[97:20.69]Did we already have this conversation already?
[97:23.34]How long do you think it would take before somebody would notice that you just had like all TV dinners?
[97:29.90]If you opened a restaurant and you went to the freezer section and you made it look nice, but it was all stuff from the freezer section.
[97:36.41]Yeah, we already talked about that.
[97:37.27]Never mind.
[97:43.97]Oh, here we go.
[97:44.59]Pay attention.
[97:54.75]All people really care about is the beer.
[97:56.33]As long as it's cheap.
[98:04.04]A lot of fish.
[98:07.08]Must have had some good reviews about the fish, because that's all you guys are ordering.
[98:11.39]That's fine.
[98:26.66]Where was the inspector there?
[98:27.64]That was pretty fast.
[98:28.72]That was pretty good.
[98:48.17]See?
[98:48.89]Did a good job.
[98:54.88]You said you eat a lot of seafood.
[98:55.96]You live in a desert.
[98:56.76]How can that be good with seafood?
[98:58.44]Well... The thing about Las Vegas is... They just, whatever they want, they get it.
[99:05.47]They'll find a way to get it.
[99:07.23]So, most of the seafood pumps in from California.
[99:11.45]So you actually can find some pretty decent stuff.
[99:15.96]Remember, Los Angeles is not even like three hours, three and a half hours in a car from Vegas.
[99:33.85]It's fake food?
[99:34.81]What would you classify as real food?
[99:44.45]You're stealing our seafood!
[99:47.26]Technically.
[99:47.94]Well, is it stealing or is it paid for?
[99:58.04]Pretty good day.
[100:05.45]Salt Lake City has sh... What is this?
[100:09.66]10% boost?

[102:23.61]Burgers.
[102:23.97]1,200.
[102:23.99]Buy chicken.
[102:33.67]Why is 1,800 bucks pizza is 1,600?
[102:36.79]Are they just, the price is getting more higher?
[102:43.85]He wonders why he has no money.
[102:45.51]He has no upgrades.
[102:46.37]That's what I'm saying.
[102:47.23]I have upgraded beer.
[102:50.52]I'm upgrading lasagna.
[103:07.65]Upgrades increase the price.
[103:08.65]Yeah.

[105:19.99]Classic Italian... Wait, they're not all meat?
[105:30.46]Shit.
[105:31.78]Meaty uses lasagna.
[105:37.67]Oh man, that's fucking tricky.
[105:51.82]Meaty!
[106:01.87]PSMCR.
[106:12.79]What kind of psycho do you have to be to not get salt on french fries and half the people get it like that?
[106:20.88]Am I just eating dry-ass potatoes?
[106:39.79]Sodium.
[106:40.87]Yeah, but I mean, if we're talking like a non-medical... What is it?
[106:57.88]People get no salt because they know it's going to be fresh.
[107:02.38]Oh, that's a fast food little DIY hack there, isn't it, huh?
[107:05.43]I don't know.
[107:07.25]You guys were aficionados in fast food DIY hacks?
[107:20.09]Can you just ask for it fresh?
[107:21.61]Can you do that?
[107:22.13]I feel like you can.
[107:29.56]Alright, speaking of fast food restaurants, West wants... It's... whatever.
[107:34.12]When, um... Not when, where should I go?
[107:53.13]Haha, you wanted that salt!
[107:55.23]You wanted it fresh!
[107:57.49]Sorry!
[108:00.23]That's not right at all.
[108:01.77]That blew that one hard.
[108:22.88]No, you idiot!
[108:23.86]I'm trying to hit the...
[108:31.31]Oh my god.
[108:32.05]It's cause when you- when you get to the P, when you get to the P, you just- your brain
[109:11.18]P-Brain.
[109:14.12]Something like that.
[109:14.76]Did this idiot stop playing with the controller finally?
[109:21.92]You'll find out when you come back in two months after your band's up.
[109:24.28]That was a long time ago.
[109:45.71]A lot of tension.
[109:46.49]A lot of tension tonight.
[109:47.71]No.
[110:02.27]How do I just throw it away?
[110:13.72]I just walked out and dumped that.
[110:15.06]Oh, fuck.
[110:15.90]I just walked out and dumped that.
[110:17.20]I move around, guys.
[110:17.92]If you don't understand, I'm moving.
[110:20.06]I just did a dump animation.
[110:23.42]I actually did it.
[110:28.51]A new bet?
[110:30.61]You can't do 20 perfect combos, plus have salads and ice cream on your menu today.
[110:36.37]I don't have either one of those things.
[110:39.17]Unclaimed money.
[110:40.11]200 bucks?
[110:44.24]And a challenge.
[110:46.22]Menu rot.
[110:46.76]Okay, I got enough money to do a hamburger.
[110:58.01]Burger.
[110:58.99]No, I don't have enough for a burger.
[111:02.57]Salads and ice cream.
[111:03.97]I can't have both.
[111:04.85]Damn, I just need to make more money.
[111:13.12]How's the menu rot?
[111:16.51]Better french fries?
[111:17.87]Better drinks.
[111:24.91]Jumbo cups and new flavor blast.
[111:33.20]No, I'm saving for hamburger.
[111:34.26]Let's go.
[111:37.20]Do it real quick.
[111:50.67]I wish I was a food engineer.
[111:54.85]Yeah, I mean, that would kinda be a cool job.
[112:05.77]Sometimes when I don't hit the slap, when I press the button, it concerns me.
[112:08.53]Because I feel like it didn't go.
[112:13.69]I wish I was a dentist.
[112:17.24]Do you?
[112:18.84]So be a dentist!
[112:20.97]Go do it.
[112:22.65]Go be a dentist.
[112:35.04]No, no, no.
[112:35.56]Not like just go be a dentist's forehead.
[112:37.94]No, just do it.
[112:39.00]Go to dentist school.
[112:41.14]Go learn about the tools.
[112:42.50]And go utilize your skills and your knowledge and become a dentist.
[112:46.34]There's a bug on me, I think.
[113:08.87]Look out for the rats.
[113:20.98]Small grape.
[113:36.61]Come on!
[113:41.15]And medium cold with no ice.
[113:43.63]Get it out.
[113:54.63]Got that.
[113:55.03]What are you... What is it?
[113:57.13]What are you blinking?
[113:58.22]Why... What is... Oh, it's...
[114:18.34]The same noise.
[114:45.52]Oh, you wanna fight?
[114:46.32]You wanna fight?
[114:47.07]Don't fuck about!
[114:59.84]That's fucking funny.
[115:05.04]I slap myself so hard in the face.
[115:24.66]How do I delete that?
[115:29.90]You know what's sad about that whole thing?
[115:31.50]Eventually, my mother's gonna see that clip.
[115:33.44]You know what I mean?
[115:36.77]In fact, she may have already seen it and just won't tell me.
[115:39.75]That's one of those things where you watch that and you go... And you just don't mention it to your son.
[115:45.89]I think she probably has already seen it.
[115:54.23]Alright, rush hour.
[116:00.15]Large diet with ice.
[116:03.43]Small with ice.
[116:05.87]This is a meaty.
[116:10.79]This is a classic.
[116:14.41]This is a meaty.
[116:19.26]This is a drink.
[116:19.90]This is a large diet with ice.
[116:32.62]Is this what it's like to work?
[116:40.87]In the food industry.
[116:41.87]In the food industry.
[116:42.95]I had to catch up there because I had to press buttons.
[116:53.26]Diet water.
[117:00.17]Click the link.
[117:03.11]This what link?
[117:09.24]The link.
[117:09.74]I don't see a link.
[117:18.70]What the fuck is this?
[118:06.09]Day is done Almost one star new item is now available commercial toilet catering opportunities Really Tower peeps are excited
[118:26.97]Very large boost of patience in the waiting room.
[118:30.28]Menu rot.
[118:31.28]It's time for a hamburger.
[118:32.36]I finally can buy a cheeseburger.
[118:34.78]Burger.
[118:35.68]Try it out.
[118:36.14]I don't know how to make these.
[118:40.80]Burgers have two stages.
[118:41.92]Cooking the meat and placing the toppings on the bun.
[118:44.58]Some recipes don't require meat.
[118:47.30]Which will automatically skip the cooking process.
[118:49.25]What do you mean no meat?
[118:53.69]You're just going to eat two buns and tomatoes and cheese?
[118:59.74]Okay.
[119:04.33]Double ingredients.
[119:05.23]Okay, so bacon, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.
[119:10.29]BLT.
[119:11.53]BLTC.
[119:17.23]How do you cook it?
[119:20.39]Meat.
[119:22.41]Two patties?
[119:23.23]Or just one patty?
[119:30.44]This looks good.
[119:36.92]Meat.
[119:37.46]Lettuce.
[119:39.12]M-L-B-C-T.
[119:41.56]This is gonna get my brain messed up.
[119:54.81]Try it one more time.
[119:57.03]Meat.
[119:57.51]Double meat.
[119:58.35]Then we have LBCT.
[120:00.73]LBCT.
[120:02.35]That's how my brain has to do it.
[120:05.23]Two patties.
[120:15.60]Meat.
[120:16.86]BBC.
[120:20.48]Delicious.
[120:21.02]Okay.
[120:22.48]I got it.
[120:25.82]Two all-beef patties?
[120:27.96]Oh, yeah.
[120:32.30]Let's get that active menu going.
[120:37.80]Burgers on the menu now.
[120:40.68]And fries.
[120:41.40]Oh, I want fries.
[120:42.84]Burgers and baked potatoes.
[120:44.74]Yeah.
[120:46.24]Nope, there's rot there.
[120:48.04]Hold on.
[120:49.62]Pretzel has to come off.
[120:51.00]And corndog.
[120:52.90]Cool.
[120:57.87]Bacon on burgers?
[120:58.89]It depends.
[121:01.29]Speaking of burgers.
[121:03.27]Bacon cheese only, please.
[121:07.21]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[121:10.93]Just go to the grocery store at that point and just get a loaf of bread.
[121:19.23]Like Oscar Mayer ready cooked bacon and American cheese and just make 40 of them.
[121:28.00]I mean, you put an egg on there, that's a different story.
[121:30.08]But there's no egg.
[121:42.95]Bizarre.
[121:48.85]Just mustard, you got it.
[121:54.30]Is this a Flash game?
[121:55.06]No, this is Cook, Serve, Delicious.
[121:56.36]It's on Steam right now.
[121:58.36]There are two of them.
[121:59.00]This is the first one.
[122:08.71]Is this the Space game?
[122:10.15]No, we already did the Space game.
[122:13.71]And it was fun.
[122:14.79]Okay, butter, chives.
[122:16.25]Butter, bacon, and chives.
[122:19.29]One meat patty, you got it.
[122:20.41]Okay, here we go.
[122:21.67]Medium water with ice.
[122:23.47]What just happened?
[122:25.39]Why is everybody freaking out?
[122:26.99]You just went off BLT!
[122:30.37]Meat and lettuce!
[122:35.62]Were all these people standing outside at the door?
[122:38.30]Is this like fucking Disney World?
[122:40.08]Did the rope just drop?
[122:42.10]Small grape with ice.
[122:45.66]And sour cream and bacon and onions.
[122:49.02]And then you are sour cream and onions.
[122:50.90]And that's, um, S and O. Medium grape with ice.
[122:55.51]Let's get a couple of beers.
[123:01.93]BLTC.
[123:12.56]It's butter.
[123:15.77]I'm fucking so hungry.
[123:18.41]Sour cream and onions.
[123:19.05]That's, uh... I just want somebody to order just a slice of bacon.
[123:31.66]It'd be one thing, okay, like, I know, oh, yeah, no, it gets busy like that in restaurants, Jeremy.
[123:35.16]Yeah, but they don't play the fucking background music.
[123:37.81]The you're in a panic background music.
[123:41.01]Imagine if the dinner rush came in where you worked and somebody turned up
[123:45.95]That kind of music.
[123:47.39]The hurry up and rush or you're going to get in trouble music.
[123:53.39]Nobody likes that shit.
[123:55.21]Nobody wants to hear that shit.
[123:56.77]This goes back to like Super Mario doesn't want to hear that shit when he gets to less than 100 seconds left.
[124:03.55]See what I'm saying?
[124:04.02]It's like... Okay, what do you need, sir?
[124:07.30]Two patty, one sesame seed and you want pickles on that and you want a hamburger too?
[124:11.12]Okay.
[124:17.46]Holy shit, a triple cheeseburger.
[124:21.68]Dude.
[124:31.10]Just a triple bacon cheeseburger.
[124:33.25]It actually doesn't sound that bad.
[124:38.69]Although, I don't know, three patties is too many.
[124:45.32]I'm a proponent of less meat on a hamburger, not more meat.
[124:54.39]When I go to a barbecue, or somebody's grilling, or, you know, you go to a place that somebody's making burgers or something, and you get those meatloaf fucking hamburgers where they made, like, 12-ounce patties, and they molded them with their bare hands, shittily, and they just sit them on the grill.
[125:15.98]Another weirdo.
[125:19.20]No, I think that's gross.
[125:34.10]Oops.
[125:41.57]Bacon, lettuce... This is a sandwich.
[125:49.01]Okay, sour cream, bacon and onions.
[125:51.51]Sour cream is S. Toilet, overflowing.
[125:59.36]Jerma's real judgemental tonight.
[126:04.14]Get that off the screen.
[126:12.77]Medium coal, but no ice.
[126:22.36]Judge Jerma.
[126:23.92]No, I think it's, um... Big patties have... I just don't... Mm-mm.
[126:33.03]I don't want to have to unhinge my jaw like a snake to take a bite out of my hamburger.
[126:50.71]I just finished work at a bar and this stream is making me anxious.
[126:55.32]Well, it won't be on for much longer.
[126:56.64]We're not going to be streaming for that much longer.
[126:58.04]We're going to come back with Mario Maker tomorrow.
[127:08.09]This is like fun.
[127:15.84]Hey, inevitably, guys, inevitably when I rage quit Mario Maker 2 after like 35 minutes, maybe I'll just play this again.
[127:24.60]Sour Creamy Onion.
[127:34.90]Do Cook Serve 2.
[127:35.50]Alright, we'll do one more, one more, one more, one more, and then I'm gonna get going.
[127:43.16]Got some Buzz.
[127:46.17]Alright, what about... I need more money.
[127:49.82]How do they expect you to have this much money?
[127:53.36]Jerm is not going to stream Mario Maker 2?
[127:55.12]Yeah, that's what I'm doing tomorrow.
[128:01.99]Yeah, that's the plan tomorrow.
[128:03.73]Let's do Mario Maker 2.
[128:05.42]For as long as I think it's fun.
[128:17.15]Oh, he's not.
[128:17.81]What?
[128:19.55]Am I speaking a different language or something?
[128:21.37]What's going on here?
[128:25.04]Oh, I can't make the crunchies.
[128:27.26]I'm just going to make money.
[128:34.56]I got the burger on the menu.
[128:36.20]Let's go.
[128:38.40]And then I'll can it after this.
[129:16.63]I can't believe... I like a piece of bacon with a... Is bit level set to $250?
[129:23.55]No, it should be $2.50.
[129:26.24]Cheese, sour cream, butter, and bacon.
[129:37.62]That's butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream.
[129:55.90]Alright, come on.
[129:58.08]Flow it together here.
[129:58.80]Try to make it perfect.
[129:59.66]Come on.
[130:15.73]Come on.
[130:26.79]How many patties?
[130:28.03]One.
[130:28.35]Beer.
[130:29.55]Cheers.
[130:51.36]Can I not- I'm hitting every button on my fucking keyboard!
[130:55.03]And I still- Really?
[130:56.79]Sour- Chives are on there, right?
[131:00.17]Sour cream!
[131:04.24]Meat only, please.
[131:09.48]Bacon and cheese, please.
[131:11.66]I'm saving a lot of money on these people.
[131:14.22]They're not buying any meat.
[131:29.55]Do you wash your hands in real life when you pee?
[131:31.65]Well, it depends.
[131:33.97]Sometimes I've been wearing, uh, like, stretchy pants.
[131:41.33]I mean, you just pull your pants and underwear down, and you just pee.
[131:47.42]And then you just pull them back up.
[131:48.72]You don't even touch anything.
[132:37.97]I don't understand what the problem is here.
[132:47.66]Okay.
[132:48.20]C-S-Y-H-B-O.
[132:52.94]I still can't even get it.
[132:56.22]There is no problem.
[133:04.98]okay so if I were to okay so let me ask you a question if you were sitting let's just say you're I don't know you're a restaurant right hold on hold that thought
[133:58.55]So you sit at a restaurant, and you grab your pants.
[134:03.39]You just touch the leg of your pants.
[134:06.69]The fabric.
[134:08.43]Do you get up and wash your hands?
[134:17.19]Yes.
[134:17.61]So if you put your hands to your sides and touch your pants, you're gonna go wash your hands.
[134:36.70]How often do you guys wash your hands?
[134:56.75]Every few minutes.
[134:57.75]No.
[134:59.23]I wash my hands every time before eating.
[135:12.17]If I touch my pants, I'm gonna wash my hands.
[135:16.81]So, when you go to the movie, and you get a big tub of popcorn, and you bring the big tub of popcorn, and you sit down at the movie, and you're like touching the seat, and you have your hands on your sides, and you have your hands on your face, and you're eating the popcorn.
[135:33.48]When I go and pee, we've both done the same thing.
[135:38.66]We've both done the same exact process.
[135:53.05]Do you wash your hands when you are eating the popcorn while you watch the Infinity War?
[135:57.85]Do you get up every five minutes to wash your hands?
[136:06.84]So when you like, I gotta like scratch my leg for a second.
[136:09.44]I gotta wash my hands.
[136:13.80]Do I not flush?
[136:14.64]I use my... I put my foot up and I like... I put... I like... And what do you mean do I not flush?
[136:20.71]Every single one of these urinals is automatic flushing.
[136:23.67]What are you talking about?
[136:26.17]Have you been to a urinal in the last 10 years that wasn't an auto flush?
[136:36.95]If you stand five feet away from that urinal and pee into it, and it auto flushes, and you didn't touch anything, what's the problem?
[136:44.41]What's going on there?
[136:46.29]Just because you entered the bathroom?
[136:48.65]Do you get germs on your hands by entering the bathroom?
[137:01.48]No, you don't touch anything.
[137:02.56]If you just pull your pants and underwear down, down to your ankles, and you pee five feet away into the urinal, you didn't touch anything.
[137:11.91]What's the problem?
[137:31.63]You can't be five feet away without aiming.
[137:34.67]Body training a toddler.
[137:53.02]But what if it's one of those urinals that really goes all the way from the wall down to the ground?
[138:00.88]Is there an issue?
[138:15.98]You mean a ditch?
[138:16.68]No, I'm talking about like the wall-to-ground urinals.
[138:19.24]They're huge.
[138:20.68]What about the splatter?
[138:24.01]Are you holding your hands down to catch the splashes?
[138:33.75]How far away do I usually go in the urinal?
[138:36.95]I usually go really close.
[138:40.86]I make it so my chest is pressed up against the urinal.
[138:46.40]Because I don't want people... I want my privacy.
[138:49.00]I press my body into the urinal.
[138:51.93]Like, press it so my chest is touching the ceramic.
[139:02.75]And then I just... Alright, I'm done with this.
[139:06.89]Save it quick.
[139:23.03]Imagine seeing some guy press his body into the urinal.
[139:27.17]You'd be like, something's wrong here.
[139:36.10]Alright, that's it.
[139:39.95]But... Anyways, I am extraordinarily excited.
[139:44.95]I can't wait.
[139:45.49]I'm gonna be... I can promise you guys this.
[139:47.14]I'm gonna be working my ass off on this stream.
[139:50.42]So... Hopefully it's gonna be worth what is... Maybe like a month or two wait for this.
[139:57.00]Somewhere into September.
[140:00.11]But...
[140:02.91]Yeah, it's... I'm hoping it's gonna be a shitload of fun.
[140:06.61]The ideas that we're throwing around and the stuff that has going on.
[140:11.51]Stay tuned, because there's gonna be a lot more to talk about.
[140:15.00]And yes, we'll go over the space pictures.
[140:16.86]We'll do that right now.
[140:17.60]I want to give myself some time to do it, and the bits and everything.
[140:22.32]I took a lot of pictures, huh?
[140:25.43]Let's see, is this the one?
[140:26.41]Yeah, it's all in the same spot, right?
[140:28.67]Let's go to the beginning.
[140:36.51]I was in the beginning, what an idiot.
[140:39.23]Alright, let's get these on.
[140:43.21]Uh, just pull up the window here.
[140:51.22]Microsoft Photos!
[140:53.16]Uh, I don't actually think I have to... I think I have to cap the whole desktop, unfortunately.
[141:01.25]Yeah, can I fullscreen?
[141:06.26]There is a full screen, would you look at that?
[141:12.25]That's pretty cool.
[141:13.29]Alright, here come the pictures.
[141:20.41]Don't be alarmed.
[141:22.84]So this is picture number one.
[141:27.12]This was the fir- I think this was an accident.
[141:36.76]Yeah, it's an accident.
[141:37.88]I like this one.
[141:39.32]This was like the cool globe.
[141:46.36]I got a lot better because these aren't very good.
[141:54.40]Decent structure.
[141:55.22]Decent placement, I think.
[141:57.40]I was going for like put two eyes here and it makes like a cool like Grover character.
[142:01.73]I like that.
[142:04.29]In the distance.
[142:04.81]That's not a bad background.
[142:08.28]A lot of these aren't bad backgrounds.
[142:15.17]Not very good.
[142:17.99]Decent.
[142:21.67]I'm getting a weird 80s vibe from this one.
[142:23.87]I'm not sure why.
[142:28.24]Oh, there we go.
[142:30.88]Now the 80s filter is off.
[142:34.54]Now this is just a planet.
[142:39.84]I really do like that half the planet taking up half of the picture on the right side.
[142:52.46]That's a keeper, I think, for sure.
[143:05.96]I would imagine this is probably what it would feel like and what you would see if you got hit in the head with a wrench.
[143:14.93]Not very... I don't know if it's very good.
[143:20.85]A little too bright.
[143:22.37]I think it needs to be dropped a little bit.
[143:26.49]Not bad.
[143:26.93]It's messy right here.
[143:28.79]A little too much... A little too much luminosity going on.
[143:33.16]Now this is good.
[143:34.08]This is...
[143:36.99]We're talking the first quarter of a second of the Universal Studios intro.
[143:42.46]Not bad.
[143:44.88]Could be a freeze frame.
[143:52.54]I like this one.
[143:53.52]This is the ice rock.
[144:01.26]Floating in the distance here.
[144:02.31]I think I get another one here.
[144:03.69]Yeah, I framed it up.
[144:09.10]Or, uh, or... Insect egg under the microscope.
[144:17.26]Or single-celled organism under the microscope.
[144:22.25]Not bad.
[144:24.37]I think I get a little bit better of a picture here.
[144:32.36]They make me hungry.
[144:33.04]I don't know why these are making me hungry.
[144:37.08]This is like nougat.
[144:38.38]It's nougat.
[144:38.92]I don't know why.
[144:39.38]That's nougat to me, and that's making me hungry.
[144:41.90]Delete that one.
[144:42.54]Not even... Okay, I just got hurt.
[144:44.74]What happened here?
[144:46.70]Oh, because of that.
[144:47.92]Eh, this is pretty basic.
[144:57.67]This could be a screenshot from Kenshi.
[145:07.26]Again, I drop-kicked you in the head.
[145:11.54]And this is the last thing you saw before you blacked out.
[145:18.15]Yeah, or finger on lens.
[145:25.02]This is 3D Movie Maker.
[145:27.98]In fact, that is, I think, the exact image from 3D Movie Maker.
[145:31.78]It's the same thing.
[145:39.20]I like this one.
[145:42.10]Ominous.
[145:43.54]Almost feels like it's moving.
[145:44.46]Doesn't it feel like it's moving?
[145:47.00]It's not, but it's kind of wiggling around for me.
[146:00.78]Um...
[146:06.37]Should have probably tilted a little bit.
[146:08.61]This picture is kind of cool.
[146:16.65]I like this nebula.
[146:19.38]The Dutch angle.
[146:25.36]This is not the one.
[146:26.18]This is not the one.
[146:27.96]It looks great, but it's the next one.
[146:30.92]No.
[146:31.90]No, it is that one.
[146:33.16]It is this one.
[146:41.69]There's the volcano crab.
[146:50.56]2020 hindsight, I wish I dropped the HDR a little bit because this is awesome.
[147:04.25]Yeah.
[147:05.27]Should have dropped the HDR a little bit.
[147:07.76]Although, this would be very, very good on the... You know, when you scroll through on Twitter and you see the speaker's advertisement for, like, a cool headset.
[147:18.71]Like, this is, like, the latest gamer headset.
[147:23.87]And there's, like, a picture of, like, your favorite streamer, like, over here.
[147:30.93]There's like some text up here, down here.
[147:32.57]This is like the gamer headset image.
[147:39.20]I don't know what that is.
[147:41.84]This just kind of hurts to look at.
[147:46.74]Even worse.
[147:50.64]This, you know, this reminds me of when you have disposable cameras.
[147:54.99]Two people have them and you think it's a funny joke to put the flashes right up against each other?
[148:00.29]And get them right next to each other and take a picture of each other's cameras?
[148:06.61]What a waste of film.
[148:12.62]I was trying to get...
[148:16.85]I was trying to... I think the next one is better.
[148:19.21]No.
[148:20.59]No, it was this one.
[148:22.79]There was a weird fade-in when it showed a lot of cool stars, but I didn't really get it.
[148:32.87]Pretty interesting cube, yeah.
[148:35.93]There's the black hole.
[148:44.94]Not sure what this is.
[148:50.88]This would be great without this.
[148:53.18]Although it is kind of weird seeing... I'm not even sure what that is.
[149:02.16]I feel like these are moving.
[149:07.14]I like this one.
[149:14.14]This one's cool.
[149:14.78]It's almost like a slinky.
[149:17.06]And then the mirror inside.
[149:24.15]And that's it.
[149:25.63]That is all the photos.
[149:32.95]I like a little firework down here.
[149:44.01]Oh, it was Florida.
[149:44.73]You're right.
[149:45.51]Six and a half hours ago, I had a third thing I wanted to talk about.
[149:49.57]And yes, that was the third thing.
[149:51.64]It was the Twitch controls robots at the carnival stream.
[149:57.48]And that I'm going to be dialing back streams.
[149:59.78]It was the green screen encore night being Saturday.
[150:05.27]Get your submission in.
[150:08.19]You need to use the Google form.
[150:12.44]Can somebody link that Google form?
[150:14.72]Get your submission in by tomorrow night.
[150:18.72]We cannot have submissions be sent in like two hours before the stream, an hour before the stream.
[150:23.66]It's not going to happen.
[150:28.18]Actually, do I still have that?
[150:29.27]I think I have the link right here.
[150:33.57]Let me see.
[150:38.51]The form is on the Discord and the subreddit.
[150:40.39]Yeah, but I just want to make sure it's there.
[150:46.16]There it is.
[150:48.02]If you have something you'd like to submit, please do.
[150:53.22]This is not a contest, by the way.
[150:55.30]It's not a contest.
[150:56.86]There are no prizes.
[150:57.82]It's just something fun for us to do.
[151:00.39]Because the first one was so interesting.
[151:04.11]So, if your submission does not get chosen, it doesn't mean that it wasn't any good.
[151:09.79]This is not a contest, so please don't think that is.
[151:14.78]But the third thing was Bloordao and Bloordao is making, he's almost done with his first pass of some of the new stuff coming to the channel.
[151:23.64]He's working on, he just showed me, um, yesterday, the new wind down screen and it looks great.
[151:32.32]There's a lot of cool things on that wind down screen and a bunch of new music as well.
[151:39.24]So that's coming pretty soon.
[151:43.82]You guys will probably get a kick out of it.
[151:50.52]And after this first pass of the new wind-down screens, and animations, and the music, he's going to be doing cheer emotes, and a bunch of new emotes, and a bunch of new sub-badges.
[152:08.83]But obviously the animations take the longest because they're animations, so...
[152:16.23]Should be fun.
[152:19.07]But with that, I'll see you tomorrow.
[152:20.57]We're going to get through the bits.
[152:25.19]We're going to go through them.
[152:27.17]Shouldn't take very long.
[152:33.51]Post the space photos somewhere online.
[152:36.12]I could probably just throw them in the Discord.
[152:39.34]I can just dump them into the Discord or something.
[152:46.53]That probably makes sense, right?
[152:49.56]But, let's go back to a few hours ago.
[152:53.24]More than that.
[152:54.46]Mario Maker 2 tomorrow.
[152:57.45]And the internet sucked tonight, by the way.
[153:01.39]I...
[153:05.33]30,000 drop frames, unfortunately.
[153:06.59]I hope this shit just can finally be over with.
[153:10.35]I actually did get a message from Cox that said that they were doing, I think because of all the complaints and all the problems, and they're real problems too, they're doing, I think they're going to do like a network upgrade to this node.
[153:29.80]Because they're going to shut us off for a while, and I think they're going to do an infrastructure upgrade.
[153:35.22]So I think we may have complained to a point where they have to do something about it.
[153:46.09]So, we'll see.
[153:49.05]We will see.
[153:51.71]But anyways, we're going to go back to earlier this evening, this afternoon.
[153:58.12]Thank you, Lunch Meal, for the $5.
[154:02.00]We're going to find the Discord.
[154:04.00]I'll show you.
[154:05.64]Right there.
[154:07.34]Somebody already got it.
[154:08.02]Night Bart already got it.
[154:08.73]It's a public Discord.
[154:11.15]If you want to join and just hang out.
[154:13.23]There's only... I think there's only one or two sub-rooms.
[154:17.13]But it's a public Discord.
[154:21.01]But yeah, enjoy yourself.
[154:23.74]uh but thanks for the five dollars lunch meal hey Jerma graduating high school today don't got much else to say besides thank you for being there for me since middle school didn't think I'd make it this far but I'm glad I did go buy yourself a sandwich or something oh I'm gonna I'm gonna get like that five bucks is gonna get two cheesy gordita crunches or three how many cheesy gordita crunches can I get with is it how much for five bucks at least two or three
[154:52.79]but thank you lunch meal sounds like you've been around for a long time so thank you for the five dollars and thank you for the lunch meal appreciate it uh we also had five dollars from captain dread pirate tuco says do I believe do you believe in gravity
[155:19.76]Well, I believe that what goes up must come down.
[155:23.84]Therefore, yes.
[155:27.33]So yes, I do.
[155:29.17]No.
[155:30.25]No, I don't.
[155:31.13]Gravity isn't real.
[155:37.91]Face palm.
[155:39.43]What goes up must come down.
[155:40.79]Of course it does.
[155:42.99]That's the point.
[155:46.91]Hey, Goosebiscuit, thanks for the $5.
[155:48.45]Found out today I passed uni.
[155:51.23]So I just want to drop a handful of bits here to say thanks for being there in the background of all these years and keeping me sane.
[155:56.61]Congratulations.
[155:59.38]Grats on the uni, university.
[156:08.04]I'm honored to be the person you've put in the background while you do whatever it is you're doing.
[156:15.71]Congratulations and thanks for the $5 and good luck.
[156:18.91]The world is your oyster.
[156:21.75]Go for it.
[156:25.59]Leo Kurtz, thanks for $5.
[156:28.34]Christopher Columbus Simulator.
[156:32.64]Yeah, kind of.
[156:35.14]You just kind of have to go discover something.
[156:40.96]But thank you for the $5, Goosebiscuit.
[156:42.56]Appreciate it.
[156:42.98]Thank you, Leo Kurtz.
[156:45.12]Wait, what?
[156:49.13]I did it twice.
[156:51.61]Why does it do this to me?
[156:53.57]That was Leo Kurtz for the $5 already.
[156:55.23]Thank you.
[156:56.34]I just rewound.
[156:58.38]Thank you, Leo Kurtz.
[156:59.64]Thank you, Leo Kurtz.
[157:04.50]I may as well have just played the same audio clip.
[157:11.31]But nonetheless, thank you.
[157:13.63]Hey, there we go.
[157:14.31]Halo Softboy for $2.50.
[157:15.89]Hey, Jerma.
[157:17.54]I read an interesting take from a guy who was saying that we're able to stare at the sun for short periods with no long-term damage.
[157:23.56]And that doing so alleviates depression, regulates penile health, and helps adjust your sleep cycle.
[157:32.26]I don't think any of those are true.
[157:39.31]And they say, I'm not a doctor.
[157:43.35]I never could have guessed.
[157:50.99]Thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the 250.
[157:52.15]This seems like a really good game for getting computer wallpapers.
[157:55.41]L-U-L.
[157:56.23]I have at least two.
[157:58.27]I know one of them I've taken.
[158:00.81]Penile health for pissing at five feet.
[158:06.06]HoneyChain, thanks for the 250.
[158:07.48]GermaOneGuy, GermaMustard.
[158:11.01]Someday you're going to be the one guy.
[158:13.07]It's going to happen.
[158:16.63]AllMew, thanks for $5, AllMew.
[158:18.21]Jerma, today was the hardest I've ever left.
[158:21.55]Thanks for all the content over the years.
[158:25.67]I now have a terrible pain in my chest and I have disrupted everyone within a 50-yard radius.
[158:33.24]Well, hopefully you enjoyed it.
[158:36.54]Hopefully you didn't disrupt.
[158:37.74]Hopefully the people in the 50-yard radius were not like
[158:42.76]Hopefully you don't, like, at a library.
[158:48.60]Or at a classical music concert.
[158:52.86]Or a children's chorus.
[159:00.41]But thank you.
[159:05.15]It's always a blast.
[159:07.53]It's always fun, no matter what we're doing.
[159:13.13]Thank you.
[159:16.31]I hope they were in a library.
[159:22.32]Thank you, Lydia Wang.
[159:24.12]Am I saying that right?
[159:24.78]Is it Lydia Wang?
[159:26.46]Lydia?
[159:29.80]Yuda Wang?
[159:30.78]Luda Wang?
[159:31.46]How do I pronounce it?
[159:34.40]I'm terrible.
[159:42.67]Liuda.
[159:44.39]Liuda.
[159:49.91]But anyways, thank you for the $2.50.
[159:51.79]God bless you, Jerem.
[159:52.53]The flush joke made me cry.
[160:00.17]Please correct me if I'm saying your name wrong.
[160:05.91]But here is...
[160:09.25]Here is some art.
[160:13.89]I'll put it on the screen.
[160:16.03]And there's something interesting about this.
[160:19.51]I don't want to give away anything, but something very interesting on the screen.
[160:24.95]Something interesting on the screen will be there in a second.
[160:30.57]I'm not going to tell you.
[160:31.83]I'm not going to tell you when you'll maybe see those.
[160:39.18]But there is a fairly big stream coming up where you might see them.
[160:48.57]There's a very big stream that I'm doing that they might show up for some reason.
[161:00.76]I'm not wearing a Star Wars shirt today though, that's the thing.
[161:12.29]Hey, what's the total by the way?
[161:13.59]Let me see, what do we got?
[161:17.35]Does it work?
[161:24.56]The bot's broken.
[161:25.52]It was up, I know it was.
[161:29.72]Explain the socks, you don't have to worry about it.
[161:35.35]I was at like minus 600 or something in the first hour of the stream, two hours of the stream.
[161:41.96]And then people started to jump on that like bandwagon of, oh, let's do everything.
[161:46.32]So let's do everything -2 and get it to about like a thousand.
[161:50.64]But I was able to comedically rise up.
[162:00.23]It was all the kid humor.
[162:13.23]You know what?
[162:13.81]I really probably should.
[162:17.39]This is an interesting idea, and it's not something I have any plans for immediately, but... I should probably just, like, have an extension get made.
[162:26.61]You know what I'm saying?
[162:28.03]That has become such a staple of this whole community.
[162:33.43]That, like, I probably should just have an extension at this point.
[162:35.87]That's, like, an actual extension you can click on.
[162:38.81]So it wouldn't be, like, in the chat.
[162:48.94]I don't know.
[162:49.70]That sounds like a fun idea.
[162:50.58]Maybe at least to try it.
[162:54.00]The stream turns off when it reaches minus 100.
[162:56.19]Would I trigger it?
[163:02.19]I mean, yeah.
[163:06.41]The stream turns off.
[163:08.93]I kind of like the idea of having an extension built where if I'm not, if the stream is not at a level of like comedy, then the stream turns off.
[163:21.59]That's actually kind of funny.
[163:29.19]And what happens at plus 100?
[163:30.19]Um... I don't know.
[163:34.94]You add like... 30 minutes to the stream.
[163:39.14]I don't know.
[163:41.14]At minus 1000 it blares an air horn in my ears.
[163:45.48]It gives you shi-
[163:48.67]Minus 200, you get, like, shocked.
[163:54.20]That would be so fucked up.
[164:01.56]I didn't realize those scores were actually counted.
[164:03.64]They haven't been.
[164:05.94]That's a very recent thing.
[164:08.02]But, thank you for the artwork, it's fucking great.
[164:12.47]Really appreciate it.
[164:17.23]And thanks for the 250 as well.
[164:19.98]You would just die in the stream.
[164:21.66]No.
[164:23.04]I did pretty well tonight.
[164:30.19]We also had... Flames192, thanks for the $5.
[164:34.52]Thank you, Flames.
[164:39.62]Yeah.
[164:39.80]Ethan.
[164:58.56]Happy birthday, Ethan.
[165:00.15]No, no, no, what you gotta do is, no, no, no, you know, go, hey, here, here, here, I got a good idea for you, ready?
[165:04.75]You know, like, the, the, it's your birthday today website?
[165:08.93]Just punch in Ethan there, and then just play this audio clip after.
[165:14.40]So it's like, oh, hey, look, I typed it in, Ethan, it's your birthday today.
[165:18.24]And then when he gets to the end of that, he's gonna be like, oh, yeah, I know this website, but then he's gonna get this shit, you're gonna play this clip after.
[165:25.17]Happy birthday, Ethan.
[165:27.52]Your buddy Flames wanted to make sure you had a very special day.
[165:31.15]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[165:33.05]That's right, Ethan.
[165:34.41]It's your day today.
[165:36.31]So, your friend has to do whatever you tell him to.
[165:41.67]You get to tell him whatever you want.
[165:43.67]And he has to do it.
[165:45.06]As long as it's legal.
[165:46.18]And as long as he's comfortable doing it.
[165:48.12]As long as you're comfortable doing it.
[165:49.76]Whatever it is that you're doing.
[165:52.46]It's your birthday, Ethan.
[165:53.86]Make it a good one.
[165:55.86]Can I get some...
[165:57.87]hype in the chat, please?
[165:58.99]Wait, he's not here.
[166:01.04]He's not in the chat.
[166:01.84]Thank, happy birthday, thank you, Ethan.
[166:03.30]No, happy birthday, Ethan.
[166:04.62]That's what I meant to say.
[166:05.86]Happy birthday, Ethan!
[166:09.90]And cut, and slice it there, and put it into an MP3.
[166:24.17]The background music is polluting the audio recording.
[166:27.07]Ethan,
[166:28.47]Look, it's your birthday today.
[166:30.99]I just want to make sure you understand it.
[166:32.80]Ethan, I am so excited that it's your birthday.
[166:36.50]We're going to have cake.
[166:37.64]We're going to have presents.
[166:38.78]We're going to have ice cream remotely.
[166:42.56]Just take this audio clip, Ethan.
[166:45.62]What I want you to do is take this audio clip and tape it to a dummy's head and just sit me at the table where we're going to have... Look at that.
[166:52.91]Oh, that's pizza?
[166:54.05]Pepperoni pizza!
[166:55.27]Ethan!
[166:56.15]I'll take the first slice.
[166:57.49]Uh-huh.
[166:57.71]I'll take the second slice, too.
[166:58.81]I mean, it is your birthday.
[166:59.69]But, I mean, come on.
[167:00.33]A guy's got to eat.
[167:01.05]So I'll probably take the first three slices.
[167:03.05]And we're only getting one small pizza.
[167:04.56]So, I mean, you know, you two, you and Flames can have, you know, maybe half a slice each.
[167:11.16]We'll just cut it in half with one of those slicers.
[167:13.55]And then I'll go home.
[167:15.57]But happy birthday, Ethan.
[167:17.15]Have a fantastic day.
[167:27.60]Use the first one.
[167:28.60]The first one was... The first one was way better.
[167:41.13]It's okay.
[167:43.23]The music, it wasn't that loud in the background.
[167:44.95]Just round it out with rock music.
[167:49.19]Anyway, happy birthday, Ethan.
[167:50.54]And thank you, Flames, for the five dollars.
[167:58.74]Hey, uh, Wizards!
[168:01.56]Thank you, Wizards Swears, for the 10 bucks.
[168:03.94]They say stream sucks.
[168:09.28]Thank you for the $10.
[168:11.60]I appreciate the feedback.
[168:17.30]Thank you, Zizzio, for the $10.
[168:22.70]Hey Jeremiah, felt it was about time to give back for your amazing entertainment.
[168:25.06]Your chat during Cook Serve Delicious reminded me of my few years in Vegas and late night runs to Roberto's Taco Shop.
[168:34.10]I have a California burrito on me, french fries, and carne asada.
[168:38.61]That sounds pretty good.
[168:40.53]That sounds pretty good.
[168:44.01]Few years in Vegas.
[168:47.63]Well, that's pretty awesome.
[168:50.32]But that's... sounds absolutely fucking perfect.
[168:54.91]Thank you for the $10, uh, ZZO.
[168:57.45]Or ZZO.
[169:05.50]I'm from Vegas and it's the best.
[169:06.78]Oh, you don't think I've ever had it?
[169:09.72]I've smelled it.
[169:14.80]That's a good-ass chain.
[169:20.04]But thank you.
[169:21.66]For the recommendation.
[169:27.34]Also, Dr. Zoot Suit.
[169:28.66]Five dollars from Dr. Zoot Suit.
[169:29.92]Hey, Jeremiah.
[169:30.32]Got accepted to the honors program at my college.
[169:32.55]It's going to be a huge pain in the ass.
[169:35.09]Thanks for always being funny and a stand-up guy.
[169:37.05]Here's hoping you can help me be sane going forward.
[169:41.29]Also, thanks for the birthday wish.
[169:42.97]Really brightened my day.
[169:45.27]Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit.
[169:47.40]And congratulations on the honors program.
[169:53.20]Hell yeah.
[169:53.52]Hopefully you get some good knowledge from that.
[169:57.96]You get some good experience.
[170:00.18]And translate that into a ding.
[170:03.34]You know what I mean?
[170:04.40]Both eyes light up.
[170:05.94]Money symbols.
[170:07.80]That's what I'm saying.
[170:11.73]But thank you.
[170:15.23]And yeah.
[170:15.63]And of course.
[170:20.01]Was your name Ethan as well?
[170:22.53]I only do birthday shoutouts for Ethans.
[170:25.21]At this point going forward, so.
[170:26.11]I want to make that clear.
[170:31.99]From this point.
[170:33.33]Now.
[170:33.87]Full.
[170:36.23]No, but seriously, thank you so much for the $5.
[170:39.03]And yeah, happy birthday.
[170:40.01]Again.
[170:41.93]Much love to you.
[170:43.83]Let's get the credits on here.
[170:45.05]There were a lot of subs.
[170:48.39]I was gone for a while.
[170:50.92]I think a lot of people were holding on to them, so... Thanks for holding on to them.
[170:54.84]Thanks for waiting for me to come back.
[170:58.22]Let's go ahead and show them.
[171:00.55]They're gonna whiz by.
[171:01.55]Right now?
[171:08.17]Yeah.
[171:10.49]Look at how many people held on to their subs.
[171:17.60]I was gone for like seven or eight days.
[171:19.12]Thanks, guys.
[171:21.24]That means a lot.
[171:30.77]Thank you, everybody.
[171:33.29]There's still a couple more bits to do.
[171:34.83]Let's get through them.
[171:38.79]DC pro thanks for three dollars I'm not sure if you said it or not but how was your time off we missed you greatly thank you for such a mood lifter I'm not sure if that's a phrase but I needed this to be but I needed this to bring a smile today hope all is well it was good I got a lot of stuff done I visited some family that I'm not going to see for a long time
[171:59.05]So a very close family.
[172:01.49]That because where we are situated in the country now, it's going to be very hard for me to ever see them.
[172:07.71]So it was good that we got to all be in a centralized location for four or five days.
[172:13.91]And then the other few days I was spent doing work on the robot carnival.
[172:23.80]then that's going to continue to happen.
[172:24.98]That's pretty much every week here.
[172:27.77]At least a couple days a week, two or three days a week, I'm going to be just completely 100% dedicated to it.
[172:38.61]I am ready to go.
[172:39.71]I'm excited.
[172:42.01]Look, Baham, it's me!
[172:44.93]But thank you, DCPro.
[172:47.36]It was good.
[172:47.70]It was a good time off.
[172:50.70]Aerialist, thanks for the 250 Aerialist.
[172:52.58]Sorry, I don't remember if I already asked this, but have you ever considered trying out PC Building Simulator?
[172:58.17]I, yeah, I considered it.
[172:59.71]I did.
[173:02.27]But I feel like I did the PC Building Simulator, like, fuckface stream, and I think, I don't think I could do, like, a regular, like, PC Building Simulator game.
[173:19.09]Because I would be actually just putting parts into the PC.
[173:24.22]I wouldn't be able to do what I would want to do, and that's season the motherboard.
[173:33.06]He modded it, he can't go back, that's true.
[173:40.54]But probably not.
[173:42.14]Not on the cards here.
[173:44.67]Spoons for self-defense, thanks for the $15.
[173:49.11]I say, Gerber, what superpower would you rather have?
[173:51.15]Becoming indestructible while T-posing, or vomit sentient bees you can control with your brain?
[173:57.70]That one.
[174:02.24]I would just make him just do everything for me.
[174:10.88]Look, look, indestructible while T-posing is fine, but what are you gonna do?
[174:16.52]You... What do you do with that power?
[174:18.99]You just T-pose and just, like... Like, fall on your back?
[174:23.83]Do you just, like, T-pose and say, run me over with your car and, like, make money at bars or something?
[174:28.20]I don't get it.
[174:31.36]I bet you I could, like, withstand you running me over with your car.
[174:34.64]I'll take that 50 bucks.
[174:36.04]What do you do with that?
[174:40.85]Having sentient bees that you can control with your brain extends your arms to an infinite length.
[174:48.82]Can you imagine an army, a swarm of bees that can go get you a soda out of the fridge?
[175:04.52]That's pretty important.
[175:06.54]They could carry you up to bed.
[175:11.22]You could just like lie back down in your bee-made bee chair and they would just fly you up and lie you into bed.
[175:21.93]And you'd get the freshest honey in the world.
[175:25.37]And sell it.
[175:27.49]You'd make more money than just being the guy that can take a shovel to the head and not die.
[175:33.91]Like in the alleyway.
[175:40.62]He didn't say the amount of bees.
[175:41.90]It could be one bee.
[175:44.86]Well, I mean, we don't have that clarification right now.
[175:50.47]I'm assuming there's gonna be at least two to three hundred that come out of my mouth.
[175:54.63]Bee armor.
[175:59.08]No, I wouldn't want to harm these bees.
[176:01.08]I'd want to take care of them.
[176:15.00]No, I don't wanna be the superpower thing.
[176:19.08]You T-pose and are indestructible, all of a sudden you end up in like a government facility.
[176:24.87]Where they're like, you're gonna have to permanently be T-posed, otherwise they're gonna get you.
[176:34.96]Do I have to- do you have to be standing still while T-posed?
[176:37.06]You just become a statue.
[176:47.44]Wouldn't they do the same thing with bees, though?
[176:49.34]No.
[176:50.16]Because they're not going to know that.
[176:53.14]I would just be the weirdo that has bees everywhere.
[176:57.91]T-posing and being indestructible is not the same thing as you have bees surrounding you all over the place.
[177:05.18]You have a lot of bees here.
[177:08.02]If anyone came knocking on the door, there would be, like, a Toy Story-level Andy's Coming scenario.
[177:13.57]It'd be like, everybody, like, bang!
[177:16.09]I would think about it.
[177:16.77]Move out!
[177:17.69]And half of them would go into, like, the forest, and a thousand of them would go under the bed.
[177:22.57]Like, two hundred would fucking just go into, like, the fucking refrigerator or something for, like, five minutes.
[177:28.27]A thousand of them would go, like, pollinate some flowers, would go... No, no, no.
[177:31.59]We would have a whole plan.
[177:32.77]And they would just be bees.
[177:33.57]They would just be bees.
[177:41.08]back into your mouth.
[177:48.38]Sir, why is your bed buzzing?
[177:51.09]It's a massage bed.
[177:53.45]I got a bad back.
[177:55.99]And then the dopey fucking idiot cartoon police officer will look at it and go, hmm, well, okay, but you be careful there, son.
[178:08.75]There's something happening out here.
[178:12.06]Hmm, alright.
[178:13.46]Yeah, I got a bad back, too.
[178:20.49]It's B. Yes, B. Yes, you be careful.
[178:22.99]You get it.
[178:23.73]Thank you.
[178:38.93]Yeah, oh, okay, don't mind if I use it.
[178:42.73]And then it's like, oh, fuck!
[178:45.73]He's gonna sit on the bed and he's gonna realize!
[178:48.63]And then, like, his phone rings.
[178:49.65]Oh, hold on a second.
[178:51.74]What's that?
[178:53.54]A dog robbing a liquor store down the street!
[178:56.16]Oh, no!
[178:57.86]And he, like, gets into his fucking car and drives away.
[179:09.08]There's always something that just pulls them away from what they're doing.
[179:14.60]This is a freelance police.
[179:16.46]Open up.
[179:19.66]Anyways, what the hell are we doing?
[179:20.88]Oh yeah, Dragon Breath!
[179:21.72]Thanks for the 250.
[179:24.34]I can't think of a witty thing to say, Jerma.
[179:25.70]Please make something up for me to say to you.
[179:29.22]Um... And they... Oh, no, they say, wait, no, I got it.
[179:31.82]It's another 250 came in from Dragon Breath.
[179:33.56]No, I got it.
[179:35.02]Pee-pee, poo-poo, ha-ha, forehead.
[179:40.20]Pretty... Pretty good.
[179:42.18]Pretty good.
[179:43.02]That's a... You got... You nailed it.
[179:45.37]You absolutely nailed it.
[179:50.97]I'm gonna write that on my tombstone.
[180:01.69]Hey, Groove Wizard, thanks for the $2.50.
[180:03.06]Hey, Jerma, uh, I showered...
[180:06.96]Okay, I said that wrong.
[180:08.30]Hey, Jerma, I showed my sister the coffee Cheetos chicken video today and she laughed her ass off until she cried.
[180:19.29]Guess your old stuff still makes people laugh super hard.
[180:23.82]If you might not think it's funny anymore.
[180:33.32]Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot.
[180:38.92]Anyways, I showed, showed.
[180:41.20]Hey, I showed my sister.
[180:43.00]And you know what?
[180:45.58]Anything that can make people laugh that... Look, years ago when we made those videos and we did that stuff, I thought that shit was fucking fun and funny.
[180:57.19]I love those old videos.
[180:58.79]So... Yeah.
[181:05.13]Anybody that gets any joy or happiness or thinks they're funny or thinks they're stupid or anything, you know, whatever.
[181:09.89]If you get anything out of these videos or these streams, then it means a lot.
[181:14.03]It's great.
[181:14.71]And I love every second of that.
[181:22.74]So I'm glad that, um, I'm glad she likes them.
[181:27.94]Because I like them too.
[181:29.25]So.
[181:31.85]Good stuff.
[181:33.33]Thank you, Groove Wizard, for the $2.50.
[181:36.47]Thevious!
[181:36.97]Thank you, Thevious, for the $5.
[181:38.37]Thanks for streaming today.
[181:39.13]My great-grandmother passed this morning, and it helped take my mind off of it.
[181:44.17]It's okay.
[181:44.61]She lived to be 95 with a great life, and we've been expecting it for a few years.
[181:48.98]95.
[181:50.12]That's a long life.
[181:53.50]On a brighter note, I'll be seeing my online seven-year best friend tomorrow for the first time!
[182:00.44]He's catching a flight here and spending almost a week and I'm looking forward to it.
[182:03.80]He actually introduced me to your YouTube channel a few years back.
[182:09.06]Turbo Heart.
[182:15.62]Wow, that's... I... that's... I'm happy for the second half of that comment here.
[182:25.99]Hopefully you guys have a lot of fun.
[182:31.51]And I'm glad that you can have something if you both think that I'm worth watching, and you can get some enjoyment out of that, and that's awesome.
[182:46.46]The first half of your comment, though, I'm sorry to hear that, but 95, that's a very long, long good life.
[182:54.91]So, rest in peace to your grandmother.
[183:00.97]Thank you so much for the $5, and I really hope that you guys have a good time.
[183:09.78]That was Thievius.
[183:10.60]Thank you, Thievius.
[183:14.99]We have a couple more.
[183:16.19]We've got Devakitty.
[183:17.55]Thanks for the $2.50.
[183:18.03]Hey, Jerma, nice to see you back streaming.
[183:19.73]We've been missing you.
[183:21.51]In recent news, my cat got a huge pustule under their eye and it turns out it was a nasty tooth infection.
[183:26.90]That does not sound good.
[183:28.76]Just that his tooth removed and I got to pick him up in an hour.
[183:31.41]He's not going to be a happy kitty, but at least he's alive.
[183:33.43]Remember to have your pet's dental hygiene checked out every once in a while.
[183:37.93]Very important.
[183:38.75]That's a great PSX.
[183:43.42]teeth in pets dogs and cats they can really get pretty gnarly and can have a lot of problems so check on your pet's dental health the next time that they're at the vet or wherever they you know take them in for an appointment make sure their teeth are doing alright and if they need a cleaning then get a cleaning if they need it they need it
[184:09.57]But sorry to hear that that happened, but also glad to hear that, um, that they're doing okay, I hope.
[184:21.02]But thank you, Depakitty.
[184:24.76]I wish the best for your cat.
[184:27.80]And finally, Tupac, Tupac, Tupac, Tupac, Tupac,
[184:36.06]Tupac Hologram.
[184:37.14]I don't know why that took me so long.
[184:39.16]Thanks for the $2.50.
[184:41.56]Hey, Jerma, did you know you were featured in a ha-ha, what-the-fuck, LOL streamer fails moment?
[184:46.16]How does this make you feel?
[184:47.32]It makes me feel great.
[184:48.97]That's what I strive for.
[184:50.61]I strive to be in, like, a watchmojo.com, L-U-L, hilarious, laugh out loud, WTF, what-the-fuck moment of the month.
[185:00.46]Oh, I'm so happy about that.
[185:03.06]That's what I do this for.
[185:06.41]I saw it, yeah.
[185:10.35]Yeah, it's real.
[185:18.52]It's real.
[185:24.70]And, yeah.
[185:28.32]Does that, does that, like, qualify as, like, did I do it?
[185:32.57]Did I do it?
[185:33.05]Like, did I do it?
[185:36.16]I did it, right?
[185:36.86]Like, I did it.
[185:37.66]I made it.
[185:41.32]I was in like a top 10 weirdo video.
[185:43.69]Did I make it?
[185:59.13]That's not even the biggest WTF moment you've ever had?
[186:02.24]Probably not.
[186:05.48]Am I going to play Baba Is You on stream?
[186:09.62]Well, you put the fish in there, so that's why I'm looking at this comment.
[186:13.86]It's so easy.
[186:14.98]I'm such a bird brain.
[186:17.52]So nice work on that.
[186:20.98]Second of all, maybe.
[186:22.81]I can't say yes or no.
[186:25.21]Probably not for at least a little while.
[186:33.58]Because there are plans for the next couple of weeks.
[186:37.64]Dark Souls.
[186:38.70]Randomizer.
[186:41.54]Cooks are delicious.

[187:18.00]We're gonna do Mario Maker 2.
[187:20.06]For as long as I can stand playing it.
[187:26.04]And we're gonna move on from there.
[187:28.64]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[187:29.90]Much love to you.
[187:31.20]See you tomorrow, same time.
[187:34.51]Take care, everybody.
[187:35.53]See you soon.
[188:11.29]Oh, let's also raid somebody.
[188:13.48]I haven't done that in, like, a few weeks.
[188:14.98]It's been, like, two weeks or so since I was gone.
[188:17.30]Who's streaming right now?
[188:20.12]What do we got?
[188:26.45]Hmm... We got... We haven't raided Vinny in a while.
[188:37.46]Yeah, let's raid Vinny.
[188:40.12]I'm not gonna, I will not be present for this raid.

[188:50.81]So let's go raid Mind Sauce.
[188:56.53]Say hello for me.
[189:00.55]Queue up if you'd like to go say hello.
[189:03.68]I believe, I believe, what are they, what is Vinny doing?
[189:10.25]Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
[189:13.57]Hmm.
[189:14.69]I'm not sure what it is.
[189:21.74]So, yeah.
[189:22.80]Go enjoy that.
[189:23.98]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[189:26.67]See you later.
[189:44.35]you
