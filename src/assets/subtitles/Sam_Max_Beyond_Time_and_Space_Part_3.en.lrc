[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.44]Hey guys, how are you?
[00:05.68]Yeah, sorry for starting like 20 minutes late here.
[00:11.39]I was not in the house.
[00:12.83]I had some last minute errands that I had to do.
[00:16.55]I had to take care of them.
[00:18.01]They kind of popped up and I was like, well, these have to get done.
[00:21.69]So that's why I'm about 20 minutes late, but we're here.
[00:26.81]Hope you had a good Memorial Day.
[00:32.07]Hope you had a good weekend.
[00:33.53]I did see you a couple days ago, but you know.
[00:41.92]Hope you're doing well.
[00:45.36]I have to start changing my diet and life and everything here.
[00:55.43]Uh, those of you that don't know, I mean, I've talked about it a few times, I'm going in for, like, a full colonoscopy, uh, at the end of this weekend here.
[01:02.70]And I have, like, a lot of foods that are off-limits as of tonight, I think.
[01:08.54]So I have to eat, like, baby food for, like, a couple days before.
[01:16.86]So, I don't know.
[01:19.06]Oh, that's not supposed to be there yet.
[01:20.78]I'm not supposed to hear that yet.
[01:24.13]I guess, no, I can still eat solid food.
[01:26.09]I just can't eat anything with seeds.
[01:29.17]Anything that has red, blue, or purple coloring.
[01:35.53]There's a lot of things I'm not, I can't, I don't think I have milk anymore.
[01:38.49]Like, any dairy, I don't think, for the next, like, three or four days.
[01:42.25]And I gotta be really on top of this, because if you fuck up, you can't do the procedure.
[01:48.79]If you have a glass of milk, like, the day before your exam, or you have, like, some beans, like, two days before your exam, you have to reschedule it.
[01:56.27]You can't do it.
[01:58.14]So, I have to, like, really, really be on top of this.
[02:00.12]I'm going to be eating Jell-O for the next three days.
[02:04.52]But, uh, without wasting any more time, because we are a little bit late here, we're going to do Salmon Max.
[02:11.07]I am going to restart the episode.
[02:15.21]This is episode three.
[02:15.91]This is season two, episode three.
[02:20.60]Last time we tried this, I was having all kinds of internet problems, and the first, it was, we make, I don't know, we got like maybe 15, 20 minutes into the episode, and I couldn't really pay attention to it.
[02:30.96]It was, the frames were dropping, it was irritating, I couldn't really focus on what was going on.
[02:35.57]So, we're just gonna restart it.
[02:37.23]I'm just gonna restart the episode.
[02:41.11]And then go from there.
[02:43.33]Because I think we would not even like 10 to 15 minutes into it, so.
[02:49.31]Uh, those of you that are wondering what we're doing for the next few days.
[02:53.27]Uh, we came up with potentially playing Heroes of Might and Magic tomorrow.
[03:01.62]I think I want to do it.
[03:02.64]I think, it depends.
[03:04.12]That's one of those stream ideas that I have no idea if people are going to like that or not.
[03:09.46]It could be great.
[03:10.92]But it also could be...
[03:13.31]Who knows?
[03:13.87]I'm willing to give it a shot.
[03:15.31]Layers of Fear 2 came out, but I also heard that Layers of Fear 2 is not very good.
[03:21.91]Isn't it getting really bad reviews?
[03:30.14]Yeah, yeah.
[03:31.18]I heard it's just, like, really not... It's not good at all.
[03:37.49]Even better.
[03:38.17]Alright, Bladers of Fear 2, like, kinda isn't that good.
[03:42.74]Even more of a reason to play it all and beat the game, right?
[03:49.68]That's the worst thing, like we just said.
[03:51.80]Neither was Days Gone, and I still play that.
[03:53.61]I know, that's gonna forever be something that's held over my head forever.
[03:57.43]No matter what video game, whatever stream that I decide to do, right?
[04:02.28]Oh, well, I'm thinking about doing this.
[04:04.30]I'm not sure if I want to do that, though.
[04:05.86]You might bore you guys a little.
[04:08.42]You play Days Gone for a whole stream.
[04:11.24]It's like, fuck.
[04:12.78]I did do that.
[04:14.02]I did.
[04:16.46]Okay, we'll give it a try.
[04:17.36]Okay, fine.
[04:17.84]Nothing can be as bad as Days Gone.
[04:19.18]And Days Gone wasn't even a bad game.
[04:20.30]It was just a bad game.
[04:21.20]Alright, here we go.
[04:22.14]Start a new game.
[04:22.52]We're going to do five community subs from Greg Nitty and Frick Club.
[04:25.73]I think I'm saying that right for the first time in like 5,000 gifted subs.
[04:35.77]Thank you so much.
[04:37.95]For the five community subs.
[04:40.89]It wasn't a bad game.
[04:41.77]Blaze of Fear 2... Blaze of Fear 1 was not good either.
[04:48.32]Well, we'll see.
[04:49.16]I'm completely open.
[04:51.44]I'm gonna get a little, like, weird over the next few days, too, because...
[04:56.04]I'm gonna try to... I know that, like, two days before the colonoscopy, like, I can't eat.
[05:01.92]So, I might have to do short streams over the next... Like, not this one, or, you know, I'm talking, like, in a couple days.
[05:08.91]We might have to short them up a little bit, because I might not have enough energy.
[05:11.89]Because if I don't eat, I become, like, a monster.
[05:19.15]It's fucking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Burger King.
[05:21.50]You understand?
[05:22.54]I go nuts.
[05:26.25]I'm going to restart episode three.
[05:41.91]You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Sam and Max.
[05:47.19]Taking your souls will satisfy my dark masters once and for all.
[05:52.12]And then I will use my army of the undead to take over the world.
[05:59.12]Damn you, Yerger!
[06:00.60]You owe me five bucks, Sam.
[06:02.98]I never thought he'd go for the cheesy evil laugh.
[06:05.44]Insolent to the last.
[06:07.34]No matter.
[06:08.52]Oh, we shall see how you make Mr. Weiss cracks after you are dead.
[06:13.63]Well, looks like this is it, little buddy.
[06:15.13]There are references that I could make, but I can't because I don't want to, like, talk about, like, story stuff.
[06:20.57]I can't even remember how we got here.
[06:22.67]What should I say?
[06:23.59]Remember, we were back in the office just back from Easter Island.
[06:28.16]That's not a spoiler for anything, is it?
[06:31.92]Somebody might accuse me of spoiling it.
[06:34.68]I can't say anything.
[06:40.92]Wait, I gotta use my gun.
[06:45.06]My voice is low?
[06:46.16]You know what?
[06:46.52]You're right, it is.
[06:48.36]My voice is low.
[06:49.34]Thank you!
[06:52.50]That should be a little bit better.
[06:53.48]I mean, you give me like a cross here and I'll send one, two, three, count to one.
[06:59.38]Ready?
[06:59.62]One.
[07:01.66]I almost had it.
[07:10.87]if I beat this game uh we did season one we're in the middle of season two doesn't being high priest of Easter island and president violate the separation of church and state blasphemy oh hang on the holy water is giving me a religious vision
[07:28.08]Oh, I remember this part.
[07:28.84]Crazy frog.
[07:29.16]What's going on?
[07:29.80]That's my favorite part of the whole song.
[07:55.76]That's the only part that I like.
[07:57.43]A snowy egret.
[07:59.15]No, a chicken.
[08:01.14]Do you mind not making so much noise?
[08:04.05]Speak up, Commissioner.
[08:04.93]I can't hear you.
[08:05.59]We're having a zombie attack.
[08:07.15]What's that, Commissioner?
[08:08.81]Zombie attacks?
[08:10.23]Gin running George A. Romero in a baby doll t-shirt outside the food court with a $43 gift certificate.
[08:15.51]We're on the case.
[08:16.67]The Commissioner says zombie attacks are popping up all over the world like pus-filled boils on the decaying flesh of, well, a zombie.
[08:24.01]Wait, who's attacking?
[08:25.63]They're coming from someplace called the Zombie Factory.
[08:30.14]Oh, zombies.
[08:31.64]Zombie attacks?
[08:32.86]You wander around aimlessly and see what you can turn up.
[08:35.60]I mean, zombie attack.
[08:36.52]I'll actually figure out where they're coming from.
[08:38.74]One step ahead of you!
[08:40.38]Alright.
[08:41.96]So, we did do this before, but... In the middle of every other dialog... Yeah, I just don't understand how these companies are allowed to do this, you know?
[08:50.15]I should get... I think I'm gonna, like, figure out how to, like... I'm gonna have to turn the router off.
[08:56.25]So, you know.
[09:01.67]Let's actually enjoy the episode.
[09:05.73]And let me... I remember I went this.
[09:06.68]I did this shit.
[09:07.08]Let me do this again.
[09:07.64]Ready?
[09:30.45]Pretty accurate.
[09:54.88]Alright, this joke has gone on long enough.
[09:56.42]It's time to leave.
[09:59.28]He's too good.
[10:00.02]Alright, for real this time.
[10:00.78]I'll get a ball.
[10:01.28]One, two, three.
[10:17.45]Oh.
[10:19.47]Oh.
[10:20.73]That took a ton out of me.
[10:24.71]I'm fucking tired, man.
[10:26.75]Oh my god.
[10:27.88]That took, like, all of my brain power.
[10:29.74]I gotta go.
[10:32.42]Uh, yeah.
[10:33.58]Thanks for watching.
[10:34.16]I can only do, like, one big thing before, like, Stry get tired and the streams have to kind of turn off.
[10:39.62]So, um, thank you.
[10:41.10]Appreciate it.
[10:53.77]not even a joke that does happen though if you were here on the last stream I like went crazy I was like I stepped on the gas for two and a half straight hours and then I was like wow I'm tired it happens alright let's get let's see what this happens isn't that cute max the rats have set up their own little casino where's Jimmy two teeth I want to show him a new sleeper hold I learned the boss is busy

[11:51.35]Yeah, we do over here.
[11:52.13]Let's go get that, because I remember it.
[11:53.61]You have to, like, throw the papers out, right?
[11:56.21]You do paperboy.
[11:56.85]Hiya, cops.
[12:00.92]Do you know... Don't spoil it.
[12:03.86]Shit.
[12:05.50]What?
[12:06.46]No, not really.
[12:07.90]Well, those days are over.
[12:09.48]Welcome to a new type of internet access.
[12:12.37]S.O.L.
[12:13.97]So simple, even a zombie could use it.
[12:17.09]Yeah, I'm getting deja vu.
[12:21.90]you know anything about a place called the zombie factory processing we have gathered extensive marketing data on zombies zombies need an easier less expensive way to access the internet that's why we developed stuttgart online for the greatest concentration of newly active zombies
[12:42.56]This is the last end of Max's stream, yeah.
[12:45.58]The crashing internet.
[12:46.82]My internet sucks.
[12:48.00]I turned- I was a zombie.
[12:48.96]I turned into a zombie.
[12:50.02]Okay.
[13:03.68]What happened to Bluster Blaster?
[13:05.56]There was a processing accident while developing our latest invention.
[13:13.06]I'm fine, Sam.
[13:14.85]Haddock is the best kind of fish.
[13:17.57]I'm fine, Sam.
[13:19.21]We regret any inconvenience this may have caused.
[13:22.81]I'm fine, Sam.
[13:24.33]Thanks for asking.
[13:25.35]Is the internet better?
[13:26.92]Um, that is to be determined.
[13:29.80]Because...
[13:31.90]We've seen essentially like 1% downtime every stream since they fixed it, in quotes.
[13:41.15]So, who knows?
[13:43.89]It's better, but I don't know if it's fixed, unfortunately.
[13:47.51]But who knows?
[13:48.13]We're just going to let it fly, right?
[13:51.84]We just want to pimp our car.
[13:53.42]We no longer offer car upgrades.
[13:56.72]Our income has been lower than previously forecast.
[14:00.24]But this neighborhood has the highest accident rate in five states.
[14:04.44]We have spent a lot of this year out of town, Max.
[14:07.90]Oh, right.
[14:09.20]So we've devoted our resources to developing the ultimate online experience.
[14:14.23]Shit out of luck, right?
[14:17.99]You're selling the internet to zombies?
[14:20.27]Not just the internet, but much, much more.
[14:24.43]From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles, and inventive new
[14:30.30]my mother says that if you guys ever used the internet in front of your parents open it next time if you have like you know you know if you have like a parents that use the internet or they don't really use it that often you open up a webpage and just browse
[14:51.28]They freak out.
[14:53.36]Something like, okay, click that, click that, drag down, open that tab, scroll.
[14:57.06]You're going too fast.
[14:58.34]And then when it stops loading, if you have like a, you know, internet slow or something, you see you open too many windows and you're clicking so fast.
[15:06.15]You're clogging it up.
[15:10.21]That's my dad.
[15:10.81]Yeah, that's everybody's parents.
[15:17.27]And then if you misclick, let's say you click and you click... Oh, fuck, I didn't mean to.
[15:21.17]I'm going to hit the back button.
[15:22.45]See?
[15:22.83]It's like, then they're justified in saying that you're going too fast.
[15:30.85]After all this time, you're not offering any car upgrades?
[15:34.59]None at all.
[15:36.17]We regret the inconvenience.
[15:39.25]There's a new invention.
[15:41.49]This is much too dangerous.
[15:43.82]Intrigued?
[15:45.00]Go on.
[15:46.04]It's the super high-powered antenna for wireless internet access while on the road.
[15:52.14]There are problems.
[15:53.88]Using it could result in catastrophic electrical failure and spontaneous explosion of your vehicle.
[16:00.35]We see.
[16:01.29]And what are the problems?
[16:05.13]Can you guys fix the bluster blaster?
[16:07.09]Can you guys fix bluster blaster?
[16:09.01]They had me fixed before they brought me home.
[16:12.85]We'll take that super high powered antenna.
[16:15.58]We spent our entire savings on development.
[16:20.06]We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.
[16:24.00]Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give installation discs to zombies throughout the city.
[16:28.85]I told my dad to press shift five times and he got sticky keys and he shit his pants.
[16:32.13]And we love shooting things.
[16:34.09]I like wearing short pants.
[16:36.27]Would you like to begin driving now?
[16:41.25]Affirmative.
[16:42.49]Initiating augmented reality driving sequence.
[16:49.68]Alright, so it was right click, right?
[16:51.18]Let me not miss any.
[16:53.72]Remember that you can now drive using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.
[16:58.28]Okay, ready?
[16:58.60]I'm not gonna miss one.
[17:00.84]Please deliver the magic
[17:02.99]Let's not miss one.
[17:04.69]Let me show you why I have a Twitch channel, okay?
[17:08.00]I need to prove it sometime.
[17:11.34]You want to strafe.
[17:13.14]I call this move the sway, right?
[17:14.82]When you're playing as the scout.
[17:16.71]You hit A and D. Hold on, no, that's 3, 2, 1.
[17:21.39]Hey guys, welcome to the video.
[17:23.99]3, 2, 1.
[17:24.67]Hey guys, welcome to the video.
[17:25.99]Here I'm going to try to get every single one without missing.
[17:30.23]3, 2, 1.
[17:30.89]Hey guys, welcome to Editing Fixes Every Problem.
[17:33.91]My name is Jerma.
[17:35.11]So if you're wondering, I can go into a server and lose 500 times.
[17:40.39]and then win one time, and show you that I'm really good at something.
[17:44.41]Because you didn't see it the other 499 times.
[17:46.37]So what do you want to do?
[17:49.10]What do you think you guys should be doing?
[17:51.30]Wait, did I lose?
[17:52.96]Well done!
[17:53.80]We've installed your new super high-powered antenna!
[17:58.46]We cannot be held liable for any injury or loss of life.
[18:03.95]I'm liking the sound of this more and more.
[18:06.98]Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.
[18:11.26]Not tonight.
[18:12.02]I don't wanna see the bright light again.
[18:15.02]Very well, you get to figure it out for yourself.
[18:18.36]So we have this antenna.
[18:20.48]We've got an antenna.
[18:22.48]And okay, three, two, one.
[18:25.50]So we got an antenna.
[18:26.32]What was wrong with the first one?
[18:28.80]I don't know, I'm second guessing my video.
[18:32.01]Okay, um, let's go into Bosco's.
[18:34.13]We can't, right?
[18:36.27]Cut.
[18:38.17]I remember back when I was doing YouTube, I thought like a funny video would be to cut every word.
[18:50.26]Try to have one of those videos where there's like an IRL let's talk to the camera videos and cut every word.
[18:58.69]And try to have it flow together so it would make sense, but... Do you understand how long that takes?
[19:05.00]For me to get like a six minute vlog where every word is a new cut... And I'm not talking like cut after every word and I'll just make it look like I cut it.
[19:15.39]No, I'm talking like say individual words and make like a fucking Frankenstein.
[19:21.81]Alright, so let's take a look at the zombies.
[19:23.03]I've got the antenna.
[19:27.36]Alright, quick question.
[19:28.68]No, I don't have the antenna.
[19:30.82]Can I put the antenna in the beer snipe?
[19:33.42]I just wanna try it.
[19:38.56]Just record the lines and let's see.
[19:40.28]I also was thinking, but then I decided against this.
[19:43.86]This is gonna be one of my, like, fucking weirdo, like, I disappear for three weeks and then, like, a video comes up randomly after, like, a month.
[19:50.64]I was going to...
[19:52.97]You guys would think I'm fucking crazy.
[19:55.05]I was gonna read like 95% of every word in the dictionary.
[20:03.90]And just upload it.
[20:05.66]But then I was like, uh... I probably shouldn't do that.
[20:14.46]Because like then, oh, I bet people could like make me say anything.
[20:17.14]Oh, that's probably a bad idea.
[20:19.51]That's not a good idea.
[20:23.35]You would have a never-ending supply of every word.
[20:25.77]Alright, let me try this.
[20:30.21]Let me get- Give me the antenna.
[20:34.61]We didn't go into Sibyl- Well, actually, I did go into Sibyl's last time.
[20:41.43]I did the green screen?
[20:44.98]Yeah, but the green screen was... I mean... This would be, like, probably twenty uploads of, like, ten hour videos.
[20:55.05]I'm telling you, I'm fucking insane.
[20:56.47]Wait, I can't take it off?
[20:59.47]Wait, am I just being dumb and building the same wall and taking the same wall up in Minecraft?
[21:10.54]Okay, so I was just building the same wall and deleting the same wall in Minecraft while talking.
[21:19.84]I've done that before a bunch of times.
[21:21.30]Alright, so let's go into Sibyl's because we didn't really get to do that last time.
[21:27.86]That's what happens when I, like, talk.
[21:29.93]I just, like, can't do anything else.
[21:31.41]I remember, uh, like, years later after I uploaded those Minecraft videos, MLC Stealth was like, hey, dude, do you know that, like, 12 minutes of that video was you building the same wall while you were talking?
[21:45.08]I'm out of applications right now, so let's just be friends.
[21:50.12]Sure.
[21:52.28]I'm sure I don't know to whom you are referring.
[21:55.36]So, Mr. Molman.
[21:59.10]Sorry, Harry.
[22:01.44]Tell me more about you.
[22:03.56]Well, let me see.
[22:05.89]Interesting things about me.
[22:07.83]This is where we left last time.
[22:15.77]Okay, so we've got a photo of Abe Lincoln.
[22:22.72]We got the... Let's talk to Harry.
[22:25.04]Yeah, yeah, on the moon.
[22:30.08]What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks?
[22:32.97]They're everywhere!
[22:34.49]You boys have guns, right?
[22:37.11]Are we just not getting through to these people?
[22:39.67]Yeah, we're really not that complicated, Harry.
[22:44.30]How's the suitor business?
[22:45.43]Can we fold this guy like up in the sofa?
[22:47.73]I don't want to be here anymore.
[23:12.63]Can I just, like, can I just close the George Foreman grill right now?
[23:15.69]And just leave?
[23:16.19]Uh... Do you remember the type of dude to walk up the stairs one stair at a time?
[23:22.60]Actually, I go up two stairs at a time.
[23:24.14]I go up two steps at a time.
[23:43.21]I'm sorry, that literally was one random comment right there.
[23:45.61]I have to respond to this.
[23:47.43]My grandfather does it.
[23:48.60]My father does it.
[23:49.62]I do it.
[23:50.00]We go up two steps at once.
[23:51.52]We don't go up one step at a time.
[23:53.40]I remember I got called out for this when I was in college.
[23:57.68]I remember going up two to three steps at a time sometimes.
[24:01.35]And this person was just like, what are you doing?
[24:03.35]And I'm like, what?
[24:04.75]Why are you doing that?
[24:05.79]That's what I do.
[24:06.59]So I'm going to have to correct that.
[24:07.83]I'm sorry.
[24:10.23]Do you know anything about a zombie factory?
[24:12.48]I'm not gonna let that happen.
[24:13.24]I'm not gonna let somebody make something up about me.
[24:16.34]No, it's a factory that makes zombies.
[24:18.72]Inconceivable!
[24:20.32]That's like making hate and evil and awfulness.
[24:24.09]So you're saying you don't like zombies?
[24:27.41]Okay.
[24:28.95]What have you got against zombies?
[24:30.51]Disgusting creatures.
[24:32.17]They're always breaking things.
[24:34.11]Zombies are why we can't have nice things.
[24:38.17]What do you mean, breaking things?
[24:39.27]Okay.
[24:39.43]He's saying that's where you crawl up the stairs.
[24:40.87]Have you ever seen a dog run up stairs?
[24:43.29]Four hands and legs.
[24:44.17]Four legs.
[25:08.09]They fly up and down stairs.
[25:10.63]They go up in like less than two seconds.
[25:13.82]You've seen a dog run up the fucking stairs?
[25:15.64]It's like... It's because they're using four where you're using two.
[25:19.54]Get down on... How do you think I do it?
[25:22.70]Hands.
[25:23.98]One step.
[25:24.82]You know, let's say you have your left foot on like the bottom.
[25:28.30]Your right foot is on the second step.
[25:30.11]Left hand on step number four.
[25:32.19]Right hand on step number three.
[25:34.85]You have, it's almost like, um, it's like doing the worm.
[25:37.03]You have to, like, do the worm up the stairs as hard as you can.
[25:40.19]And you'll get up there in less than fucking two seconds.
[25:43.85]Stop betting people.
[25:44.99]Hey, dude, bitch, I can get up those stairs in less than a second.
[25:47.79]Shut the fuck up.
[25:49.07]I bet you won Bitcoin.
[25:50.95]Oh, yeah, you're on, man.
[25:52.15]Yeah, alright.
[25:53.37]And then you fucking go down on all fours and do, like, a worgen run up the stairs and the guy owes you one fucking Bitcoin.
[25:58.33]Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil?
[26:00.81]I'm in it to win it.
[26:03.03]Ha-ha!
[26:07.33]People are going to try that and get hurt.
[26:12.27]Why would you ever try that?
[26:19.94]I have a disclaimer at the beginning of every stream.
[26:23.08]This is comedy.
[26:24.96]Everything that you see and hear is comedy.
[26:28.56]Don't try this comedy at home.
[26:30.64]It's a disclaimer every single stream.
[26:32.98]Do not try this comedy at home.
[26:36.35]See you later, Harry.
[26:37.23]Zombie!
[26:43.70]What gives, Sybil?
[26:44.80]Did you start your dating service again?
[26:46.26]Not quite.
[26:48.18]All my clients are applying for dates with me.
[26:51.32]Um, as kind of officers of the law, we have to point out that that's kind of illegal.
[26:55.58]Does that mean we can shoot her to regain health points or something?
[26:58.86]What?
[26:59.86]No.
[27:00.55]Get your heads out of the gutter.
[27:02.01]It's not like that.
[27:03.99]I'm looking for my soulmate.
[27:08.17]Um, I hope it's not that guy.
[27:11.53]Oh, the soul-mater, right.
[27:31.80]How much money do you think?
[27:32.72]Okay, so... I have a Starbucks here, and I'm drinking out of a straw.
[27:36.08]Like, I'm, like... What do you think I could, like, get for an auction for this straw?
[28:07.34]Would I be able to get more than ten dollars for this straw?
[28:15.86]One bitcoin!
[28:19.76]A hundred and fifty?
[28:22.22]I think somebody would just be insane and it would be like a thousand dollar joke to somebody.
[28:29.14]And then I would buy a thousand more straws and do it again and get a thousand more dollars a thousand more times.
[28:37.32]I think I'm- all I need is just- that's all I need.
[28:42.44]Sure you don't need help with that soul meter, Sybil?
[28:44.82]If you're not married by now, there's not much time left.
[28:48.10]There's plenty of time.
[28:49.86]I still have a lot of data to analyze while I figure out how the soul meter works.
[28:57.17]I hear that.
[29:24.00]Yeah, I gotta sit at the front row in a movie theater, guys, unfortunately.
[29:27.48]Do you know anything about a place called the Zombie Factory?
[29:30.16]I'm the one guy that sits in the front row.
[29:32.00]I can't see.
[29:34.32]Irrational fear of zombies.
[29:37.87]Interesting.
[29:39.09]But yes, I did get an email about something like that from some friends in Europe.
[29:43.19]Can we talk for a second about this?
[29:44.39]I can't remember where exactly.
[29:49.20]Can we talk for a second, just for a second about this?
[29:50.94]I know people want, I know we gotta, like, move on and play the game, but, like, I need to talk to you about this.
[29:54.34]This is very important.
[29:56.08]That's a lot of no's.
[30:04.25]Alright, fine.
[30:05.71]Fine, never mind.
[30:06.83]Never mind!
[30:07.87]Okay.
[30:09.81]You know what, you know, are you sure?
[30:11.74]I'm gonna do it anyways, you know I am.
[30:15.31]Remember to lock up tonight so the zombies can't get in.
[30:18.27]Get in?
[30:19.75]There are zombies right outside?
[30:21.83]I'm not going to lock my door.
[30:24.00]This is a public place and they have the right to peacefully assemble just like anyone else.
[30:29.72]Okay.
[30:32.10]What about Abe?
[30:32.72]Don't you want to give Abe another chance?
[30:34.84]Abe who?
[30:35.96]You were telling me more about yourself, Harry.
[30:39.16]I was detailing my various prescriptions and inhalers, if I remember correctly.
[30:48.54]alright how can you afford to keep your shops let's see let's get some clues I'm still getting residuals from when I was queen of Canada the new location is a lot better for me not as nice as edmonton with its temperate summers and outstanding cost of living but I get by tell us royalties I get it you guys flipped really well very quickly on this good luck finding your soul mate
[31:15.32]Is that merchandise?
[31:17.48]Yeah, they've got t-shirts!
[31:19.42]T-shirts!
[31:21.26]I was going to do louder, but I thought my voice was going to crack, so I panicked and stopped halfway through.
[31:25.09]Notice how I did two t-shirts, because I was going to go t-shirts, t-shirts!
[31:35.81]But I thought it was going to be t-shirt, and it would have been really embarrassing, so I fucking immediately stopped.
[31:40.72]Alright.
[31:45.64]Um, can we drive around with this car now?
[31:48.44]Does that antenna do anything?
[31:55.90]Hmm.
[31:58.02]Well, I can't go in here.
[31:58.86]The lucky vermin.
[31:59.93]The lucky vermin.
[32:02.01]What was I gonna say?
[32:06.55]I was just gonna say, why does the movie theater have, like, even the first five rows?
[32:09.85]You know what I mean?
[32:15.13]Pull it back and like add the rows up top on like a balcony.
[32:20.04]Nobody sits in those rows.
[32:21.68]That was it.
[32:22.08]I was gonna talk a lot about it.
[32:23.16]I was gonna talk about how you could have like a performer there before the movie.
[32:27.46]You guys would have thought it was really funny.
[32:29.68]Like pull back the first five or six rows and before the movie starts hire like a circus performer to like fucking juggle.
[32:39.35]I don't know.
[32:41.47]Instead of those previews that nobody fucking... You've already seen the previews on YouTube like three days ago.
[32:47.66]I am looking forward to when the previews are gone.
[32:51.12]And we don't have to watch them anymore.
[32:53.30]Hey, look.
[32:54.24]There's a gaggle of zombies.
[32:55.88]Politely lining up outside.
[32:57.83]Ooh, classy.
[32:59.65]Yeah, Europeans make the most refined undead.
[33:02.53]This must be the place.
[33:05.30]Yeah, and then they do, like, all the commercials and stuff.
[33:07.42]It's like, dude, I paid, like, a ton of, I paid, like, fucking 15 bucks to watch this movie.
[33:13.45]And, like, 20, I have, like, it's like a 40 to 50 dollar bill for two people to go to the movie and get, like, popcorn and shit.
[33:18.75]Because the movies are like the airlines.
[33:22.29]Why did that happen?
[33:26.19]Yeah, you're in, and by the way, everything is times 10 money.
[33:30.00]And you can't bring anything in here.
[33:32.10]Welcome to the airport.
[33:33.40]Why the fuck is that?
[33:34.08]I don't understand why that happened.
[33:35.48]That makes no sense.
[33:39.20]Why is a drink like $7 at the movie theater?
[33:43.89]It's just like this weird fucking wormhole you go into where everything's just 10 times more expensive for no reason.
[33:50.13]Burgah Boy used to bring in cheeseburgers, and we would go to fucking McDonald's and he would get like six McDoubles, and he would just keep it in a jacket, and we would eat... It was better than popcorn.
[34:02.66]But anyways, get rid of the previews before the movies, hire a fucking performer, hire like a stand-up comedian!
[34:08.93]Imagine if you had, like, instead of 20 minutes of previews, there was like a 15 minute, like, act in front of you of a guy like doing like jokes and stuff.
[34:19.77]You could, like, tip him.
[34:22.54]Maybe better than watching, yeah, like, the same, like, Coca-Cola commercial you've seen a hundred times.
[34:29.17]Stand aside, Undead.
[34:30.53]We have to get inside.
[34:32.29]Yeah, go film a music video or something.
[34:35.40]Yeah!
[34:37.66]Typical zombies with their overinflated sense of entitlement.
[34:43.32]Well, you wouldn't have a stand-up comic out there before, like, a drama or, like, a horror movie.
[34:50.56]There would be different things for different movies.
[34:54.24]If you were going to see a Will Ferrell movie, they'd have, like, a fucking couple of comedians.
[34:57.85]Like, get you ready.
[35:00.66]If you were gonna go see like a drama, I don't know, that'd be like a mime smoking a cigarette that just was silent and it was red poetry or something.
[35:09.07]I don't know.
[35:13.21]Beat it, zombies.
[35:14.35]Go back and bury yourselves.
[35:19.81]Are you gonna pay for that?
[35:20.45]It's already paid for.
[35:21.05]Let me go in.
[35:26.83]Have it be a full bar down there.
[35:28.71]Yeah!
[35:30.25]Are you serious?
[35:31.69]Oh, hello, sir, Mr. President.
[35:33.55]Agent Superball!
[35:37.81]What are you doing here?
[35:38.91]The place is being overrun with zombies.
[35:41.11]Yes, ladies' night is always packed.
[35:43.13]The master is a genius at promotion.
[35:44.91]Okay.
[35:47.84]So, Superball.
[35:48.94]Superball.
[35:51.60]No, didn't work.
[35:52.74]Superball.
[35:56.02]Superball.
[35:58.84]Oh, okay.
[35:59.86]What about kids?
[36:00.94]Like a mime smoking before... Well, that's an R-rated movie.
[36:04.89]If there was, like, an R-rated drama or something, there wouldn't be any kids in that theater.
[36:09.71]And plus, they would just be on, like, a filter above them.
[36:14.81]Okay.
[36:29.64]What is this place anyway?
[36:30.78]This is the zombie factory.
[36:32.30]I knew it.
[36:32.68]I told you.
[36:33.21]Ancestral home.
[36:34.55]Garrison of his undead army.
[36:36.21]Best doors in all of Baden-Württemberg.
[36:40.13]We're here on official freelance police business, Superball.
[36:46.53]sorry sir we're at capacity you'll have to wait in line the master insists okay we have to stop we need to get in the line won't move any faster if you keep interrupting me sir the line's not moving at all super ball I don't see your point sir this is a beetlejuice thing where if we say that like 10 times he's gonna like take a mask off maybe a few uh washingtons will help speed up the line or even a Lincoln I hope you're not trying to bribe me sir
[37:17.15]Okay.
[37:17.99]Well, we always have to come back to something.
[37:19.96]What's over here?
[37:25.94]A coffin.
[37:28.80]A coffin that's been opened from the inside.
[37:32.66]Wait, you mean zombies?
[37:35.58]A coffin that's been opened from the inside.
[37:38.56]It's an open grave.
[37:41.80]Ever seen Young Frankenstein?
[37:42.88]Yes, I have.
[37:43.28]The master of all cinema, Gene Wildman.
[37:45.14]When they put a stone slab over your corpse, you know they really don't want you coming back.
[37:49.29]OK, so we got a brain.
[38:10.02]Anything else over here?
[38:10.58]What about this?
[38:11.12]Gravestones.
[38:12.37]I hear you.
[38:12.75]Eat brain.
[38:13.41]I'm not gonna eat the brain.
[38:15.87]Alright, this is the tomb.
[38:31.49]Tome, I know.
[38:32.79]Tome.
[38:33.47]Tome.
[38:34.77]Tome.
[38:35.75]I said it right the first time.
[38:36.75]I usually say tome.
[38:37.85]No, I say tome.
[38:39.25]The tome.
[38:40.53]What do I usually say?
[38:41.23]I usually say the T-O-M-E, right?
[38:44.93]I gotta get this brain in me.
[38:46.26]How do I get it in?
[38:52.52]Can I, like, entice the zombies with the brain?
[38:54.94]I was going to wait, but I think I'll dig into this tasty brain right now.
[39:01.90]They were about to eat me along with it.
[39:03.86]Sometimes I wonder if you're really dedicated to this job.
[39:06.96]Can I throw it?
[39:10.26]Can we, like, throw it off the cliff?
[39:15.28]Here, come here.
[39:15.70]What about you?
[39:16.56]Can you do something?
[39:17.47]No way.
[39:18.67]Can I do something?
[39:19.21]Nothing to do with it.
[39:20.91]Hmm.
[39:21.49]Can I put it in the coffin?
[39:22.71]Maybe they'll, like, go into the coffin?
[39:27.25]Yeet the brain.
[39:28.29]No siree.
[39:30.45]One day, I'll be able to show you guys.
[39:32.27]I can throw shit real far.
[39:42.61]I just put all, like, my anger and all my energy and all my, like, ADHD and, like, all my fucking explosive personality and I just get behind it.
[39:51.34]I fucking... And I can literally throw a rock, like, farther than anyone you've ever seen.
[40:04.18]Like, it's ridiculous.
[40:05.50]In another world, I would have been like a center fielder.
[40:08.82]I can hit home plate from all the way back.
[40:12.24]I take like 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, like 5 crow hops and just fucking my arm explodes.
[40:22.69]I've already told you about this, and this has been documented by other people that have been at arcades.
[40:30.22]That punch the thing, to see the pounds per pressure on your punch, I go over 800 to 900 every time.
[40:37.56]You guys know the thing I'm talking about, I've already talked about this.
[40:41.29]That like, punch the punching bag arcade machine, I like, break the fucking thing.
[40:46.85]I'll prove it one day.
[40:47.97]Next time I'm in an opportunity to do it, I'll get a video, and you will see my, just my fucking, my power.
[40:54.45]It's, I have power.
[41:00.29]People think I'm making it up.
[41:01.49]You'll see.
[41:02.81]You'll see my, like, explosiveness.
[41:08.23]What about in the trash?
[41:09.07]They'll go in the trash, right?
[41:10.36]Yeah, well, they get out of line.
[41:15.40]The bottom of the screen is cut off.
[41:17.50]Um, I think it has to be, because... It's, like, has to run in a window.
[41:22.71]I'm sorry.
[41:23.49]I can't fix it.
[41:24.05]Alright, um...
[41:29.67]Well, I have these garlic clo... Won't this, like, kill them?
[41:32.83]Oh, that's for vampires.
[41:36.00]Nobody can do anything with the brain.
[41:38.02]Nope.
[41:39.04]Well, let's just go back, then.
[41:44.14]One-punch Jerma.
[41:49.30]Uh, let's go home.
[41:55.36]Oh, wait, hold on.
[41:55.90]Can I?
[41:57.48]Of course not.
[41:58.82]Can I, like, put the brain on the antenna?
[42:01.30]No.
[42:02.24]No, come on!
[42:03.00]That would... We're not leaving, are we?
[42:08.63]I want to drive around and hit a bunch of zombies with some CDs.
[42:11.73]Me too!
[42:18.33]So I can throw these.
[42:19.30]Hit zombies.
[42:22.24]Yeah.
[42:23.30]So what... What is this gonna do for me?
[42:29.94]I couldn't even click.
[42:31.68]Couldn't even click.
[42:33.18]Couldn't even click.
[42:41.23]Couldn't even click.
[42:43.11]It's not clicking!
[42:43.99]Wait, why is it at a 15 now?
[42:53.80]Oh, a decal.
[43:01.42]No.
[43:02.64]I don't want more than one bumper sticker.
[43:04.06]Remember we talked about this?
[43:05.46]I'm going to end up with a bunch of bumper stickers.
[43:07.34]Not good.
[43:09.05]No.
[43:09.37]No.
[43:21.24]Alright, so I have grain.
[43:22.56]I have garlic.
[43:24.92]Cigarettes.
[43:25.62]And then I have... Okay.
[43:32.33]What do I do with these?
[43:37.53]Oh, whoops.
[43:37.85]I haven't even gone in here.
[43:40.39]Oh, Stinky!
[43:42.41]Stinky!
[43:42.91]No, not good enough.
[43:46.33]Stinky!
[43:47.35]That was alright.
[43:51.31]Do something about these flies.
[43:53.03]One time I was in a restaurant.
[44:14.02]And I was ordering food.
[44:15.42]I heard... I just got done, like, putting the order in.
[44:20.00]And it was maybe five... It was probably, like, less than five minutes later.
[44:24.46]I'm sitting down waiting for the food.
[44:25.94]And I hear from the back... Gotta do something about these flies!
[44:31.86]And I was just sitting there going, oh, fuck.
[44:35.09]What do you mean, do something about these flies?
[44:38.92]Does that mean that they're back?
[44:40.16]What does that mean?
[44:41.56]And you kind of can't, like... I couldn't just be like, ah, hey, excuse me.
[44:47.26]Can you just, like, not make that food?
[44:49.42]So I just ate it.
[44:55.85]And it was pretty good.
[44:57.49]It was actually really good.
[44:59.47]But I'll never forget that.
[45:00.89]You don't think you'd want to fucking scream that with customers in your restaurant.
[45:05.43]What's this sticky black goo?
[45:07.60]that's my gooey molasses tar cake it's a recipe handed down through my family for centuries all the way back from the primordial ooze from the looks of it it's like
[45:24.62]You never want to go to, like, the doctor, and, like, the doctor's just, like, about to do surgery to you, and he looks at the nurse and just goes, I don't know, really, like, if these tools have been cleaned in the last six months or not.
[45:39.57]Do you know?
[45:41.11]No, I have no idea.
[45:42.78]Oh, well, whatever.
[45:44.16]You don't want to fucking hear that.
[45:46.10]Why would you want to hear that at a restaurant?
[45:47.80]Alright, let's talk to Stinky.
[45:52.46]Any more zombies?
[45:53.04]Zombies giving you much trouble, Stinky?
[45:54.47]Give him a break.
[45:55.41]Okay.
[46:17.75]So, have you heard from Grandpa Stinky lately?
[46:21.27]Like, from beyond the grave?
[46:24.16]The dentist is in your mouth.
[46:25.52]You've got to do something about these flies.
[46:27.98]Alright, if there were flies in a doctor's office, like a shitload of flies, I don't know.
[46:35.24]The first thing I'm going to think of is, where's the body?
[46:40.15]You know what I mean?
[46:40.71]Like, that's fucked up.
[46:41.77]What the fuck are you, why is that here?
[46:44.23]It's like the first thing I'm going to think of, and it's going to freak me out.
[46:46.33]Like, why would there be that many flies?
[46:51.56]Dentist office?
[46:53.40]No.
[46:54.78]There would be no reason for that.
[46:56.32]They're so clean.
[46:57.50]There's no... What, do they eat, like, a fucking steak and cheese sub and just let it sit outside?
[47:02.56]Like, on the counter?
[47:04.86]What's with the sun lamp, woman who will call stinky for the sake of convenience?
[47:08.80]So that's what that is.
[47:10.22]Oh, I mean, of course, that's what that is.
[47:12.74]I have to look my best, you know.
[47:15.76]The magazine set such an unrealistic standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.
[47:22.09]How do you know it's clean?
[47:23.15]Because one thing that I'm certain of at the dentist is that the tools are clean because, this is very important, they do this to the doctor too.
[47:30.44]I'm not gonna just talk shit about the doctor, the dentist, they both do this.
[47:33.46]They come with the tools in the bag that is sealed, and they open the bag of tool chips.
[47:40.31]They, pfft, sealed.
[47:42.25]New tools, every patient.
[47:43.81]That's how you can tell.
[47:46.31]Can we have your sun lamp?
[47:47.77]What could you possibly need it for?
[47:50.35]Max needs a UV bulb for his teeth bleaching regimen.
[47:53.07]You think a smile this white comes naturally?
[47:55.69]Well, go ahead.
[47:56.71]I don't need... I mean, I'm done with it.
[47:59.35]Okay, so we can take the sunlight.
[48:03.37]We'd like to order something.
[48:04.69]Supplies are low because of the zombie attack, so we're probably out.
[48:08.77]You do realize that's not going to stop us, right?
[48:11.93]Go ahead.
[48:12.67]What do you mean?
[48:15.23]What are you talking about?
[48:15.87]They don't do brand new tools?
[48:17.99]They're like sealed in this like plastic that just rips open and it's brand new.
[48:22.28]New tools.
[48:23.70]It's not new tools every time?
[48:25.30]So you're telling me that like the dentist like scalpels and scrapers and scratchers have been inside somebody else's mouth?
[48:40.10]No, now if they open up a new sealed bag... I think I've asked this question to the dentists before, and they're new.
[48:52.35]Yeah, they are new.
[48:53.57]Yes, they are.
[48:54.17]No, no, if they're in like a sealed bag, sealed like... I'm telling you, they're new.
[49:01.85]Seared grouper in a maple syrup reduction with bacon-wrapped dates and toffee chips served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper clippings.
[49:09.50]Sal, number three.
[49:15.28]Chicken chow mein with chocolate-covered raisins and a caramel swirl.
[49:18.64]Sal, give me a hyperactive spider monkey and a powder blue cardigan, and why don't we go ahead and wrestle him to the ground and tickle him till he pees?
[49:25.55]I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.
[49:28.45]I'd do this for a living.
[49:29.69]What, you're a dentist for a living?
[49:32.84]Do we have a one dentist in here?
[49:36.71]Dentists don't use recyclable tools.
[49:40.97]Is there an actual dentist?
[49:42.25]Alright, AdventureMFDan is a dentist, like is a real dentist.
[49:47.63]Yeah, can you look at this for me for a sec?
[49:50.09]Can you just take a look real quick?
[49:51.57]Where is this?
[49:52.47]Can you look at this for me?
[49:53.73]I got this like fucking painful tooth right here.
[49:56.26]Can you like take a look at that?
[50:05.36]the special ah my special gooey molasses dark egg it's an ancient family recipe ancient you've heard of course but have you ever tasted them so I'll take two slices sorry I used up the blowtorch on some zombies who didn't tip it's impossible to cut you're welcome to look at it though just don't touch
[50:28.41]They're new.
[50:29.83]Nothing for us.
[50:30.41]They're new tools.
[50:32.33]Look, I'm gonna just... I don't care.
[50:34.12]I'm gonna just say that they're new.
[50:37.20]Every time.
[50:38.50]Because that... I don't want to... You know, I used to have this really, really horrible problem when I was younger.
[50:45.68]I'm fucking out of my mind, right?
[50:46.98]Let's get that... Let me preface this really quickly.
[50:50.20]When I was like 12, 13, like 11, 12, 13, like just kind of turning like adolescence and into like a teenager sort of like in between there.
[50:58.60]I was terrified of hotels.
[51:01.33]Because I didn't want to sleep in bed that somebody else slept in.
[51:06.61]And there was one scenario in particular where somebody had a note that they left in the hotel room.
[51:11.62]We were at like Disneyland or something.
[51:14.42]Disney World when I was younger with my parents and my family.
[51:17.40]And somebody had a note that they left a previous person that was in the hotel room.
[51:20.88]And it was like, Bob or something.
[51:22.91]To Bob!
[51:24.57]And it was like, I don't know what the note, it doesn't matter what the note says.
[51:27.45]All I know is that Bob was here.
[51:29.35]And Bob in my brain was this, like, fat guy that, like, didn't shower.
[51:33.27]And he slept in that part of the bed that I was going to sleep in.
[51:35.59]And I wouldn't sleep in the bed.
[51:37.71]I was, like, crying at, like, 11, 12.
[51:39.74]Like, no, but, like, what if Bob was sleeping there?
[51:46.24]And they're like, it's fine.
[51:47.42]Bob wasn't even in the room.
[51:48.98]They tried to, like, make some story up just to get me to, like, calm down.
[51:55.20]Bob may have slept on that side, he smells.
[52:00.52]I had an issue with things that other people used.
[52:05.60]Don't ruin the dentist for me.
[52:07.08]Bye.
[52:14.83]Wanna help me carry this thing around, Max?
[52:17.05]I just want the bulb.
[52:20.78]Did you just get deja vu?
[52:22.98]Just close your eyes and it'll pass.
[52:27.13]Bob farted on your pillow.
[52:31.09]I don't know.
[52:31.57]You guys know what the type of fucking crazy shit people do in hotel rooms?
[52:41.55]Alright, let's talk to Abe.
[52:48.02]what's shaking Abraham she's gone left me this is a new dentist every time yeah new dentist with new tools in his jacket new jacket jet like all everything has to be brand new what do you know about zombies pests hooligans
[53:11.91]They always gather outside the memorial with their million zombie rallies and groanings.
[53:18.93]Always playing that awful music they listen to.
[53:21.55]How do you stop zombies?
[53:23.89]How do you stop a zombie?
[53:25.41]Beats me.
[53:26.51]Just between the three of us.
[53:27.81]I'm pretty hopeless at anything except making speeches.
[53:30.35]Oh.
[53:31.59]What?
[53:33.45]Sybil's looking for a new boyfriend.
[53:35.59]Fine, I don't care.
[53:36.95]Aren't you jealous?
[53:38.57]Do I buy a new toothbrush because the toothbrush is in my mouth?
[53:42.17]No, because it's my mouth.
[53:47.20]No, I didn't put the toothbrush into your mouth and then say, did you get clean?
[53:51.50]And then brush my teeth.
[53:53.72]It's my mouth.
[53:57.88]You really blew it with Sybil, huh?
[54:00.14]It was just a simple misunderstanding.
[54:02.79]like I can't understand why you aren't as hot as that moai head she took that completely out of context how do I know that it's only been in my mouth because they make them in a factory and they seal them and they come in a sealed package and then they you open the package and it's new don't nobody there's no such thing as a toothbrush they manufacture them at a plant and they send them out there's not recycled toothbrushes at like CVS
[54:34.04]Who's gone?
[54:35.18]Sybil!
[54:36.88]Of course she left you!
[54:38.36]She dumped you like yesterday's breakfast when she caught you macking on the moai heads!
[54:42.31]It's not fucking true.
[54:42.89]I'm sure it was just one of her moods.
[54:44.35]I don't believe that.
[54:44.89]They test them.
[54:47.11]But there's no toothbrush recycling program!
[54:51.41]You don't like send the toothbrush back to the factory!
[54:57.28]Just clean it!
[54:58.66]This needs to be cleaned!
[55:02.85]Oh my god, no, you guys are fucked.
[55:05.41]No way.
[55:14.55]No way.
[55:15.83]What do you mean Google it?
[55:16.81]Yeah, maybe like some of the material, the recycled plastic is not the same as like... Then you don't like send a toothbrush to the factory and they run it under hot water and like reseal it.
[55:29.59]Keep a stiff, hairless upper lip, Abe.
[55:31.89]Always.
[55:34.75]Yes, they do.
[55:35.53]Oh, please.
[55:36.43]Alright, so we got a lamp.
[55:40.97]We got a bulb, cigarettes, and a brain.
[55:43.55]Maybe can I put the... Where do I need to put this?
[55:48.18]I have the antenna.
[55:53.10]I didn't even realize stoplights could become Vikings.
[56:05.78]Can I put the brain inside of the socket there?
[56:11.02]It's literally the first link.
[56:13.34]No.
[56:14.42]But this is not... When you go to see... We're talking about two different things here, guys.
[56:24.59]The toothbrush at CVS in the package is not the same exact toothbrush that was inside of Bob's mouth.
[56:35.75]No.
[56:36.85]No.
[56:38.89]No, it's not!
[56:40.17]It's not!
[56:41.05]It is not!
[56:42.11]I am s- No, it's not.
[56:43.71]I- I'm looking this up right now.
[56:45.29]This is horseshit.
[56:47.77]No fucking way.
[56:53.11]There's no way!
[56:56.58]Recycled toothbrushes.
[57:01.12]Are toothbrushes recyclable?
[57:06.33]It is recyclable, but if you recycle it with the rest of your plastics, it will ultimately be sorted and sent to a landfill.
[57:16.14]Sorry, guys.
[57:22.96]Are toothbrushes biodegradable?
[57:25.50]No.
[57:27.87]They recycle toilet paper.
[57:35.90]Crazy.
[57:37.98]Oh yeah, they recycled toilet paper.
[57:44.98]That would be like so ridiculous of a process.
[57:48.71]Yeah, you wiped your ass with Bob's ass.
[57:55.49]Please.
[58:03.67]Alright.
[58:05.11]Let me think about this here.
[58:06.01]We've got the ceremonial urn.
[58:08.27]How do we put the brain in the urn?
[58:09.57]Nope.
[58:10.47]Nope.
[58:12.83]Desk lamp.
[58:15.69]Oh yeah?
[58:17.76]What if I put a super light in it?
[58:20.24]Fuck.
[58:36.08]Your braces were recycled.
[58:42.98]I'm not sure quite where I'd stick it.
[58:45.48]No.
[58:45.90]Okay, the beer stein definitely is something here.
[58:47.70]It only fits in a light socket.
[58:48.75]Can I do something with the beer stein?
[58:50.09]What about the cigarette?
[58:53.09]Does anybody want a cigarette?
[58:54.11]Nah, I can't.
[58:55.15]Except cool people.
[58:56.11]Not even the... Sadazi.
[59:00.49]Nah, I can't condone smoking for anyone.
[59:06.96]Um, was there a socket or anything in Stuttgart that I remember?
[59:10.38]Hydrate.
[59:12.65]I'm fine.
[59:14.21]And I know everyone's going to talk about, I could go off on a million years of a tangent here.
[59:19.35]Oh, your water.
[59:19.95]What about your water?
[59:20.67]Your water's recycled.
[59:21.51]What about your water?
[59:22.17]You're drinking pee.
[59:23.13]Oh, it don't matter.
[59:23.99]It don't matter.
[59:29.78]You understand, I have a water purification system.
[59:34.09]It removes everything.
[59:37.69]Everything.
[59:40.03]So, I'm sorry.
[59:42.21]You can tell me that's recycled.
[59:43.45]That's fine.
[59:45.07]I'm perfectly fine with that.
[59:49.65]You ever test it?
[59:50.41]Oh yeah.
[59:51.73]Oh yeah.
[59:52.73]It's the real deal.
[59:58.71]I don't use a Brita filter.
[60:00.25]Oh please, what do you think I am?
[60:01.71]Some kind of fucking dummy?
[60:04.98]Brita filter.
[60:06.26]You don't, oh please, do not come at me with this nonsense.
[60:10.50]I tell you I have a pure water filtration system and everyone thinks I have a Brita pitcher.
[60:15.19]Oh my good, I'm offended.
[60:16.61]Okay, I need to like, I gotta stop like fucking around and like actually play.
[60:28.30]It's too fun just to fuck around though.
[60:32.11]Yes, I have supreme filtered water.
[60:34.97]Supremely filtered.
[60:37.23]I will put that up.
[60:38.47]You know what?
[60:39.43]It is fucking supremely filtered.
[60:46.05]I'm gonna go back to Stuttgart.
[60:55.82]I could probably do that.
[60:56.64]I could probably piss into this thing and drink it.
[60:58.36]I really... I'm serious.
[61:00.42]It's that good.
[61:04.12]You could put red food coloring in your water and your water would come out clear.
[61:09.36]You understand the level of purification we're talking here?
[61:16.39]I don't think you guys understand.
[61:20.59]You want me to like shout out a company right now?
[61:22.37]I will.
[61:23.27]I'll do it.
[61:24.25]Don't make me sh- Don't make me- Don't make me turn this into like a sponsored stream here.
[61:28.06]I'll do it.
[61:33.34]Okay.
[61:34.30]Alright, fine!
[61:36.92]I- No!
[61:38.76]No, you figure it out for yourself!
[61:42.64]Alright, let's- what can I do with this light?
[61:55.61]Uh, I use a Berkey.
[61:57.05]I use a Berkey water purification system.
[61:59.97]It's the best in the fucking world.
[62:05.43]So, there you go.
[62:07.55]You want the best fucking cleanest water you can fuck in the world?
[62:11.03]Get a Berkey.
[62:11.43]You think that's bullshit?
[62:18.84]Go do your research, look it up.
[62:26.79]Why do you filter your water?
[62:27.99]I don't want Bob's piss in my water, okay?
[62:44.38]What the fuck are you?
[62:45.10]Wait, what are you talking about?
[63:00.57]Big Berkey filter.
[63:02.35]What is this?
[63:02.83]What is this nonsense?
[63:10.73]Uncertified.
[63:11.35]That's bullshit.
[63:11.93]Let me read this.
[63:20.29]This is a hit piece.
[63:21.27]This is definitely some kind of hit piece.
[63:22.73]This is a hit piece.
[63:23.77]Is there another... Wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[63:25.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[63:26.49]Hold on.
[63:27.67]Pull... Wait.
[63:29.27]Everybody pull yourself out.
[63:30.63]Don't just jump to conclusions here.
[63:32.43]Before you read this article, don't... Everybody... Don't... Relieve your brain of all things.
[63:38.52]Is there a water filter that they're pitching in the end of this?
[64:02.08]Hold on, let me see here.
[64:08.43]How long ago was this?
[64:10.84]No, it's the cleanest water I've ever had.
[64:14.36]This is like a year.
[64:15.00]It's nothing.
[64:37.24]One review from one review.
[64:40.10]What about all the other lab tests?
[64:47.94]How about this one?
[64:49.41]How about healthy families for God?
[64:51.83]Let's take a look at this one.
[65:14.99]It works, it's very good.
[65:16.33]I can se- I know, I've seen the tests.
[65:20.93]That article links to pure filters.
[65:24.31]Well, better not.
[65:38.00]Why don't you just boil it?
[65:39.44]You can't just- How do you boil, like, fuckin' a gallon of water every day?
[65:43.42]That would be so annoying.
[65:52.61]Is it a reverse osmosis filter?
[65:54.17]I don't know.
[65:55.61]Maybe.
[65:56.03]It's good.
[65:56.55]It's good.
[65:57.07]I like it.
[65:57.87]It does what it's supposed to do.
[66:00.91]Told you I wasn't supposed to say a brand.
[66:02.32]I knew this was going to happen.
[66:03.36]I'm always going to be fighting an article that says it's good.
[66:18.72]What do I do with the brains?
[66:20.62]Nothing doing.
[66:21.58]Fucking murky water filter.
[66:23.80]It was expensive.
[66:25.80]It's good.
[66:26.30]I like it.
[66:26.90]I like it.
[66:27.26]I'm going to move on.
[66:28.28]I'm moving on.
[66:28.68]I'm going to put this back in its right.
[66:30.17]I'm going to recycle these things.
[66:35.45]Alright.
[66:35.79]I'm going to play the game now.
[66:37.37]Everyone's just trying to make me look bad.
[66:40.69]It didn't work.
[66:42.51]It's better than a bread filter.
[66:43.79]It's way better.
[66:45.08]It's way better.
[66:47.26]Alright.
[66:51.83]I can't tell if he's supposed to be barfing or asking us to tithe.
[66:55.50]Both are scary.
[66:56.98]Maybe he's supposed to be an embittered waiter spitting on our food.
[67:00.58]I'm gonna go drink a glass right now.
[67:12.15]Oh shit, okay.
[67:14.75]Something smells good.
[67:15.87]I'm gonna get a glass of water right now.
[67:18.39]I'm proud we found a non-violent solution to our problem.
[67:21.68]Yes, ripping the brain from a freshly buried corpse was the start of a kinder, gentler Salmon Max.
[67:26.84]He just can't.
[67:27.36]It doesn't matter what it is.
[67:28.50]Next.
[67:30.24]That'd be us.
[67:31.18]I could tell you guys that God.
[67:33.50]Sorry, sir.
[67:33.98]You'll have to leave any hazardous items outside.
[67:36.44]Actual God.
[67:37.44]Part of the clouds.
[67:38.76]Holy water.
[67:39.64]Taboo.
[67:40.40]Ray!
[67:42.76]Hello!
[67:46.34]And you're like, there he is!
[67:48.60]Please have a taste of the cleanest, most pure water that we have up in the heavens.
[67:55.05]Taste it.
[67:56.29]It's so clean from the clouds above your clouds.
[68:00.93]Wow.
[68:01.59]And I would take a sip and people would go, that's a scam.
[68:05.09]Somebody would write an article about it.
[68:08.27]So God parted the seas and took water from the clouds above heaven.
[68:13.31]And we tested it.
[68:14.67]And there was 2% fluoride still in it.
[68:18.19]What is... What are you talking about?
[68:19.67]There's a little bit of a... Inorganic compounds are still trace material.
[68:24.97]You should get a Brita filter instead.
[68:27.86]What?
[68:36.10]It doesn't matter what it is.
[68:40.87]Let's go in.
[68:42.37]Let us and.
[68:43.59]Sorry, sir.
[68:44.25]You'll have to leave any hazardous items outside.
[68:46.67]Garlic clove cigarettes.
[68:48.07]Not allowed.
[68:49.09]Holy water.
[68:49.97]Taboo.
[68:51.00]Alright.
[68:51.98]So put them in the trash.
[68:53.14]I don't have any holy water on me.
[68:56.58]Alright.
[68:56.86]Let me in.
[68:59.38]Let us and.
[69:01.65]Very well.
[69:02.19]Have your IDs ready, please.
[69:04.23]Use a voice.
[69:05.74]Yes, sir.
[69:07.00]Welcome, creatures of the night, to the zombie factory.
[69:19.34]Stream yourself testing the water.
[69:21.40]I don't have the tools to do that.
[69:24.64]Welcome to the 80s, Sam.
[69:25.94]We've been waiting for you.
[69:42.75]Don't drink the water in this house.
[69:44.39]You just gotta trace about you.
[69:50.03]players from the Midtown Cowboys.
[69:52.57]Bit players?
[69:53.79]We're the S.T.A.R.S.
[69:55.66]S.T.A.R.S.?
[69:57.24]Please stop, you'll make me to giggle.
[70:01.20]Ooh, look at me, I'm so edgy and subversive.
[70:05.34]Only Alfezzaly is truly acquainted with the darkness.
[70:09.70]So what's your story, Emo?
[70:11.31]I am Jurgen.
[70:12.57]I am not surprised you don't know me.
[70:14.31]No one truly knows me.
[70:18.90]There's thumbs through the rings?
[70:20.45]Jesus.
[70:20.63]Hmm.
[70:27.64]Just every soul I take, my army grows larger.
[70:33.48]Oh, I did not just reveal my master plan.
[70:35.86]That was easy.
[70:37.50]Back, foul monster.
[70:38.78]We're here to put a stop to your evil scheme.
[70:41.38]Yeah, cut it out with the zombies already.
[70:44.03]Stop me?
[70:45.87]So many others have tried.
[70:48.11]That is how you say, played, yo.
[70:52.07]Now you must excuse me, for I am a way to dance.
[70:56.57]I never knew vampires were so fruity.
[71:00.01]Not all vampires, Max.
[71:01.74]Just the European ones.
[71:03.20]Please, let me... Oh, what are you gonna do?
[71:05.66]You're gonna drop a couple more 1-1s?
[71:07.84]Zero mana 1-1s?
[71:09.38]That sounds easy to me.
[71:10.30]What does he got?
[71:12.54]Alright.
[71:17.10]I'm thinking a, um... I'm thinking about using a guy with a taunt card here.
[71:21.10]Be nice.
[71:22.78]Click.
[71:23.64]If I did it during... You would have laughed at it if you thought it was funny.
[71:29.45]Is Hearthstone not cool anymore?
[71:30.71]Did I miss the boat on that or something?
[71:35.39]It was never cool.
[71:35.97]Yes, it was.
[71:36.34]You played it.
[71:36.82]You bought like $100 worth of cards.
[71:38.00]I know you did.
[71:40.38]Don't tell me that a couple years ago you didn't like it.
[71:56.28]Why do they always have bottles of water at raves?
[71:58.94]Because of all the drugs, Sam.
[72:00.36]Then we better take one.
[72:03.96]Alright, so we're going to ash a garlic cigarette into this water.
[72:08.22]And we're going to give him unpurified water.
[72:11.24]God damn it.
[72:12.90]I need to learn to, like, just close my mouth.
[72:20.38]Ready to drop some fat beats or something?
[72:23.12]Nah, I'm okay.
[72:24.23]I went before we left.
[72:27.37]Whoa.
[72:27.93]Alright, will we go?
[72:30.23]So we're gonna make him dance?
[72:33.16]Torment.
[72:35.90]Sub-Zero.
[72:39.35]Embrace.
[72:42.13]Sepulcher.
[72:44.82]Parents.
[72:46.25]Parents.
[72:47.21]Desire.
[72:48.31]Desire.
[72:50.25]Succubus.
[72:52.07]Try to do a combo here.
[72:53.33]Abyss.
[72:55.77]Blood.
[72:56.53]Do you guys remember these things?
[72:59.19]Letters.
[73:01.19]This is just the device that you could pick and it would be like, I'm gonna make a putrid, revolting puke.
[73:09.80]Let's all make a slimy, stinky fart.
[73:14.39]Holy shit, I used to love these.
[73:16.17]Misery.
[73:19.99]Do they still make those?
[73:21.25]Embrace.
[73:23.73]Pure energy.
[73:26.55]Pain.
[73:29.53]They still... No, no, no.
[73:30.57]It's like a... It's a physical device.
[73:32.43]You bought it at like a toy store.
[73:35.15]I'm only 19.
[73:35.57]When was that?
[73:36.91]Oh, that's why.
[73:37.67]Alright, well I don't know what these are for, so I have to figure that...
[73:47.90]I like that one.
[73:48.95]So eventually I'll figure out what song needs to be played here.
[73:55.25]There's some poetry inscribed on this coffin.
[73:57.91]My dark mistress longs for death.
[74:00.60]To return to her velvet sepulcher.
[74:03.38]Her only passion the voids embrace.
[74:06.42]Or else she'd reply to my letters.
[74:08.76]Okay, hold on.
[74:09.32]That's poetry?
[74:10.62]I didn't say it was good poetry.
[74:12.47]Wait a minute.
[74:13.07]So, I think those correspond to the... Does that... Those correspond to the dials there?
[74:18.37]My dark mistress longs for death.
[74:20.41]To return to her velvet sepulcher.
[74:23.37]Her only passion the voids embrace.
[74:26.15]Or else she'd reply to my letters.
[74:28.72]Hold on, let me go take a look.
[74:30.26]Whee!
[74:30.38]How much does it make me shave my head on stream?
[74:34.56]I would not do it.
[74:36.04]Okay, so... There's... What?
[74:44.69]Letters.
[74:46.55]Sepulcher.
[74:47.45]Sepulcher.
[74:49.07]What is it?
[74:49.73]Death, right?
[74:50.91]Abyss.
[74:51.27]Succubus.
[74:52.13]Succubus.
[74:52.79]Sepulcher.
[74:54.21]Letters.
[74:55.40]Succubus.
[74:57.80]Sepulcher.
[74:59.88]Letters.
[75:05.68]Maybe it has to be a certain B?
[75:06.88]What was it again?
[75:11.75]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[75:13.54]My dark mistress longs for death.
[75:16.34]Turn to her velvet sepulcher.
[75:18.51]Her only passion, the void's embrace.
[75:21.63]Embrace.
[75:22.53]Embrace.
[75:30.36]Embrace.
[75:33.04]Okay, so death is not on here.
[75:38.26]Suck.
[75:39.10]Embrace.
[75:41.32]Letters.
[75:41.88]I don't know.
[75:43.07]Is embrace... Embrace sepulcher.
[75:50.73]Embrace sepulcher.
[75:54.95]Letters.
[75:58.65]I guess that's not all of them.
[76:07.62]Well, let's just... Maybe I don't have the whole thing.
[76:13.34]Because I don't know what the beat's supposed to be.
[76:14.82]What is this one?
[76:15.22]This one has something here.
[76:16.00]There's a poem inscribed on this bookcase.
[76:17.60]There's a poem here.
[76:18.22]Everyone relax.
[76:19.50]It's been worn down.
[76:21.18]I can't read it.
[76:22.52]That doesn't even rhyme.
[76:35.31]Yeah, these just changed the song.
[76:36.77]Death.
[76:36.93]Death.
[76:44.62]What?
[76:46.74]What?
[76:48.38]What?
[76:49.18]Razor.
[76:50.04]Oh, yeah.
[76:51.50]Okay.
[76:55.79]Alright.
[76:58.05]Here we go.
[76:59.61]So it was embrace, death, sepulcher.
[77:03.53]Embrace, death, sepulcher.
[77:08.15]Letters.
[77:08.69]Letters.
[77:09.15]Letters.
[77:11.44]Embrace.
[77:12.76]Death sepulcher.
[77:13.80]Death sepulcher.
[77:14.72]Embrace.
[77:17.92]Sepulcher.
[77:19.78]Embrace.
[77:21.02]Embrace the letters.
[77:21.88]Letters.
[77:22.62]I saw it open.
[77:25.97]I'm not an idiot.
[77:26.45]Razor.
[77:26.57]Death adder.
[77:27.19]I can't see a thing.
[77:43.69]Oops.
[77:45.03]Sorry, little buddy.
[77:45.79]Okay, so this brings you up here.
[77:54.45]Spotlight.
[77:54.91]It's the spotlight for the zombies dance.
[77:57.23]I have something in my inventory.
[78:00.53]Check this out.
[78:01.23]It's going to go.
[78:09.47]And aim the spotlight at his head.
[78:17.88]Okay.
[78:18.22]Well, that's in.
[78:19.23]Can I move this around?
[78:26.55]No.
[78:26.79]What else is up here?
[78:29.89]Let's see what else is in here.
[78:49.21]You're too dumb for this puzzle?
[78:50.23]Ban that guy for life.
[78:53.63]I've been in this room for like three minutes.
[78:55.91]Ban that guy for life.
[78:59.38]I just put the bulb in.
[79:01.22]Ban that guy for life.
[79:08.14]No, no, no.
[79:08.42]I wanted to click on the axe.
[79:17.26]A purely decorative display of violence.
[79:19.44]Kind of like Max.
[79:20.96]He's power hungry.
[79:21.92]Yes, I am.
[79:25.76]You ever seen me throw a fucking rock before?
[79:28.12]A fireplace with no fire, no logs, and no chimney.
[79:33.43]Nothing suspicious here.
[79:34.75]Let's keep looking.
[79:38.33]Typewriter ribbon?
[79:41.15]Alright.
[79:41.75]I'm not... Just hear me out on this.
[79:46.49]This is important.
[79:47.97]Right here.
[79:50.33]No, like, right here.
[79:52.66]Right... No, like, right here.
[79:54.74]I thought this was, like, one of the M&Ms.
[79:59.60]I thought this was an M&M.
[80:00.62]I don't know why.
[80:01.16]Like, one of those cartoon M&Ms. ...
[80:09.08]Alright, does that have to... Okay, I just got the... The ribbon, type-write ribbon.
[80:13.59]What is this?
[80:18.55]Okay.
[80:24.15]What's over there?
[80:25.22]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[80:26.78]I'm just looking around.
[80:29.52]I'm just browsing.
[80:32.83]Look, every time you go to a store, just do a hurry up and finish the puzzle.
[80:37.46]Wait, when you go somewhere and you go to the store, you just instantly go by the, you just walk in a straight line to the one item you want at the store and you fucking walk to the exit and pay for it?
[80:45.94]No.
[80:46.87]You walk towards the area you want to go to and then you make a left into like home section.
[80:52.97]Oh, what's that?
[80:53.39]Let me look at like the microwaves.
[80:54.73]Then you keep going.
[80:55.33]You go to what you need.
[80:56.23]You browse around the other shelves.
[80:58.15]Actually, I need a new HDMI cable.
[81:00.58]Come on.
[81:13.81]And my latest dance is called the inconsolable Nephilim.
[81:18.62]He's dead.
[81:19.02]Check it.
[81:23.22]Oh, oh, oh, oh, it burns.
[81:25.77]It burns.
[81:30.79]It's okay.
[81:31.45]No problem.
[81:32.23]They're still cool.
[81:33.63]It's us.
[81:34.79]Okay, so... Do I have to poison him?
[81:37.01]Let me just check.
[81:38.07]Will he drink this?
[82:00.94]I'm gonna ash the cigarettes into his water.
[82:03.76]Like, he's probably gonna be like, oh, I'm thirsty now, right?
[82:05.92]They don't look thirsty.
[82:07.08]No.
[82:13.71]Having a good time?
[82:16.57]They're about as articulate as your typical club goer.
[82:19.15]Okay.
[82:20.57]I mean, can I move, um... I have this, like, typewriter ribbon now.
[82:27.69]I'm not necessarily sure what it's for.
[82:32.21]I mean, can I aim it at him again?
[82:33.23]He's just like off the dance floor.
[82:50.35]Hey, Jorgen.
[82:51.31]Yeah?
[82:54.14]Do you have a source of power?
[82:55.18]Where is the source of your power exactly?
[82:57.52]Just curious.
[82:58.16]Yeah, we just want to look at it.
[82:59.92]Americans, the source of my power is not something you can buy and own.
[83:05.66]It is my style.
[83:07.32]The zombies love me because of my rhymes, my moves, my staying on top of the letters.
[83:13.14]Give me a small rock to throw.
[83:15.16]The only thing that is truly a model apart from vampires, which I am also.
[83:21.63]Do you know where one of those punching machines is?
[83:27.16]Okay.
[83:28.90]Ooh.
[83:56.46]Okay, new location unlocked.
[83:57.70]Zag.
[84:10.12]You know, for a master of style, you don't seem all that great.
[84:14.11]Yeah, you're just kind of dated and mopey.
[84:16.45]I don't get the thrall.
[84:17.83]Well, my zombies know how late it is.
[84:20.99]I speak to the bleakness of our existence, winner of MTV Bavaria's most doleful lyrics competition for 270 years running.
[84:30.09]You've got a castle and a zombie army.
[84:33.44]What have you got to be down about?
[84:35.50]Yeah, we're at least twice as miserable as you are.
[84:38.32]Would you like to prove it?
[84:40.50]How do we do that?
[84:41.50]Prove it?
[84:41.80]Every night is open mic night at the zombie factory.
[84:45.36]You may try your pitiful best to win over my audience, and then I will assault them with my freestyle melancholy, and they will continue to be in my throne.
[84:54.54]We have to do some open mic night?
[84:55.63]How do we know you won't cheat?
[84:57.27]I never cheat.
[84:59.07]Yes, some of my rivals have been found with the blood drained from their bodies, but this is mere coincidence.
[85:06.65]It's on.
[85:07.47]Oh, it's on.
[85:08.81]Very well.
[85:09.72]But I always emerged victorious.
[85:12.74]I gather one could say it's in my blood?
[85:18.60]He's doing it again, Sam.
[85:20.06]Being all Euro-freaky.
[85:22.22]Don't let him psych you out, little buddy.
[85:24.12]Let's show him how the real goths do it.
[85:26.19]What's with the banjo?
[85:27.59]I'm going for Southern Gothic.
[85:29.13]My name is... Here we go.
[85:32.53]This is where... I don't think we have the info for this, but... Count Cryptwind Deathgrasp.
[85:42.59]MC Ryman Canine.
[85:45.79]I would pick this one.
[85:46.51]MC Ryman Canine.
[85:48.03]And I'm... That's a TF2 one, so I have to click it.
[85:56.16]And we're gonna kick it out awkward style, yo.
[85:59.01]We're the freelance grave robbers, and we're ready to go, see?
[86:03.61]We'll knock you out, deader than Pellarubio, see.
[86:07.47]We're taking over your house like we're Nancy Pelosi.
[86:10.07]Apologetics!
[86:12.25]That long ago?
[86:12.89]We're rocking Sundance like we were a parkaposy.
[86:18.45]We like our breakfast, no, because it's sunny and cozy.
[86:21.03]That one.
[86:26.04]I'm saying top or bottom.
[86:31.84]We'll knock you out deader than Bela Lugosi.
[86:34.62]We got more rhymes than you can beg, steal, or borrow.
[86:38.23]Because we're too good.
[86:39.43]The guy's heat to the row.
[86:41.39]And we're kicking those schools like Pop Rocks and Charo.
[86:44.37]Our world is endless torment and it is sorrow.
[86:47.31]We build technology for the writer tomorrow.
[86:49.92]This one.
[86:50.68]Torment and Sorrow.
[86:52.43]Our world is endless torment and sorrow.
[86:55.51]Despair!
[86:56.79]You bloodsucker MCs best get out of our way.
[87:01.76]Cause you're flappy and pink like a salmon fillet.
[87:04.74]Cause I've been to snappy like a David Mamet plate.
[87:07.92]We're stupid.
[87:08.68]We're stupid!
[87:10.40]Um... This other creation ends in death and decay.
[87:12.99]This one.
[87:15.52]Because all creation ends in death and decay.
[87:18.22]Entropy, gee.
[87:19.57]Peace out.
[87:22.51]Pathetic.
[87:23.65]You have all the street cred of white 30-year-old video game programmers.
[87:28.17]Hey.
[87:28.63]Ouch.
[87:29.51]Now, take a listen to how far it is done.
[87:35.71]Bleeding wounds, self-inflicted, baleful morning hackatai.
[87:41.55]That was terrible.
[87:42.41]That was terrible.
[87:43.35]Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[87:45.19]Uh... So... What was wrong with that?
[87:46.87]Hold on.
[88:12.23]Do I need, like, more info?
[88:13.23]What was wrong?
[88:13.69]Was it the introduction?
[88:16.95]Gotta go full emo.
[88:18.69]Okay.
[88:19.37]Yeah.
[88:22.13]Max and I want to challenge you again.

[90:52.63]Right?
[90:53.57]Like, we have to, like, can I just go ash the cigarettes, the clove cigarettes in there, and just dump them in his head?
[91:08.50]Or maybe it can, like, if he bites, maybe, hold on.
[91:10.56]Can I put it in there?
[91:27.70]He won't just, he won't smoke them.
[91:32.06]Nah, I can't condone smoking for anyone.
[91:38.66]Smoke them if you got them.
[91:41.10]Smoke cigarettes in real life.
[91:49.51]So he drinks, he'll drink the water.
[91:54.56]I need to fill this up.
[91:55.58]Do we have the bottle?
[91:56.64]Okay, so we have the bottle of water.
[91:58.66]I can't, like, do anything with this.
[92:03.47]Is there, like, a church anywhere?
[92:19.38]Let me go back in here.
[92:22.66]Max is a priest.
[92:24.56]Oh, come on.
[92:26.46]Yeah, holy... I don't have any holy water, though.

[93:36.89]Okay.
[93:46.74]Are you method acting or something?
[93:48.74]Hardly.
[93:49.68]I've legally changed my name to Mr. Featherly.
[93:52.60]Philo Featherly?
[93:54.30]No, Mr. Featherly.
[93:57.35]It simplifies the licensing contracts considerably.
[94:00.87]Okay.
[94:02.12]You're pretty big in Germany.
[94:23.37]Okay.
[94:23.91]Do you have any crazy fans?
[94:26.19]I should go change my real name.
[94:28.99]Okay.
[94:44.01]With your new popularity, do you need some freelance bodyguards?
[94:47.43]No.
[94:48.09]If Ms.
[94:48.53]Pandemic rejects my application to be her suitor, I may need to call on Ms.
[94:53.73]Grunwald.
[94:54.65]A wise actor must adapt and adjust.
[94:59.28]alright what happened to your love of the theater so we're gonna film a new scene let me see I could play torvald in a doll's house two shows a night for an entire year and still not make as many euros as I get from licensing a single poster of my beak not my face just the beak
[95:18.28]Change your name to Presto E. Majesto.
[95:20.58]Are you ready for a new season of Midtown Cowboys?
[95:22.86]Well, we have been busy.
[95:23.94]Okay.
[95:44.32]What is the E?
[95:44.76]The E stands for Eve.
[96:09.23]Yeah, in Twitch chat.
[96:12.09]People just said it all the time, so I just decided it was gonna just be E. Alright.
[96:19.27]So long, bird.
[96:22.57]The E stands for E. Yeah, the E stands for E, lowercase ee.
[96:28.86]Alright, is there any items I can take from here?
[96:38.59]Is the whole entire studio open to look around?
[96:42.79]Oh, what?
[96:45.77]Come on.
[96:47.85]What's this bullshit?
[97:01.27]What's going on here exactly?
[97:03.56]Biggest episode of Germany's top.
[97:07.31]We have to do something here.
[97:08.71]We have to make something interesting happen.
[97:09.85]Now, what that is, I have no idea.
[97:11.33]Okay, what's this episode gonna be about?
[97:25.69]What the fuck?
[97:49.26]Okay.
[97:50.76]So what are we doing in this scene?
[97:52.90]I feel like I'm skipping ahead here.
[97:53.72]Your motivation is to not get fired.
[97:56.40]Just read your lines from the cue cards, keep away from the props, and follow Featherly's lead.
[98:01.24]He's the one who's selling the t-shirts and soundtrack CDs.
[98:05.45]Okay.
[98:07.25]Let's see what happens.
[98:07.89]We're ready to start filming.
[98:09.67]It's about time.
[98:11.39]Alright, people.
[98:12.31]Places, everyone.
[98:14.37]Let's make some money.
[98:15.76]Art.
[98:16.54]Let's make some art.
[98:19.22]Tonight, a very special episode of Midtown Cowboy.
[98:23.04]Who is this?
[98:23.54]Is this a narrator?
[98:31.73]Do I have control?
[98:32.95]Can't we just ignore the problem and hope it will go away?
[98:36.49]Mr. Featherly needs our help now.
[98:38.71]Oh, there he is now.
[98:42.75]Is the lens cap on the camera still?
[98:44.64]I must have left my bag in here.
[98:46.22]Take the lens cap off.
[98:49.84]You're filming the most important TV show in history.
[98:52.78]There's no feed!
[98:54.51]That's right, Mr. Featherly.
[98:55.91]We have been hiding a cow.
[98:57.33]But you've been hiding something much worse.
[98:59.77]What?
[99:00.69]I don't know what you're talking about.
[99:02.67]For the love of God, Mr. Featherly, stop with the lie!
[99:06.37]Is it a radio?
[99:07.29]Just look what you're doing to Bessie.
[99:10.46]We saw what's inside your bag.
[99:12.68]How do you explain this?
[99:15.96]Oh, Guts Mac brand malt liquor?
[99:18.70]We see you drinking it all the time.
[99:20.46]How did I break it?
[99:21.28]I just clicked the let's go button.
[99:26.10]Oh, how could I not be?
[99:28.08]It's got the smooth Hickory aged taste that makes every night a special night.
[99:33.87]It sounds delicious.
[99:35.17]Let's go buy some right now.
[99:37.53]Boys, aren't you forgetting something?
[99:42.75]Well, thankfully I don't have to click anything.
[99:44.65]Hey, good job.
[99:45.09]Excellent work, everybody.
[99:46.09]Old Gutsmack malt liquor breaks Jerma... Okay, so... Cool.
[100:12.19]I believe that's it.
[100:12.83]Oh, it's a poker table.
[100:13.45]Alright, well, I'm gonna go back.
[100:14.17]Let me leave here.
[100:14.65]I can't go that way.
[100:15.43]Poker Night at the Inventory.
[100:17.81]That is a game.
[100:22.59]You're right.
[100:22.94]Alright, let's get out of here.
[100:46.82]Are we leaving already?
[100:48.02]Yeah.
[100:51.16]Um, let's go.
[100:52.80]Let me just make sure.
[100:57.91]I feel like I'm gonna click on everything.
[100:59.75]Hold on.
[101:00.91]Please.
[101:01.63]Not even fictional characters have time to read these days.
[101:04.73]The characters we play are champion horseshoe skippers.
[101:07.57]But in real life, we're champion horse skippers.
[101:12.45]The cow doesn't do anything.
[101:17.02]Or does the cow do something?
[101:18.36]Did something happen in that scene that I was supposed to see?
[101:21.57]Sorta.
[101:22.83]Can I take it?
[101:48.84]It's Mr. Featherly's bag in the scene.
[101:50.90]There's a bottle of water inside.
[101:53.71]Oh, yeah, okay.
[101:56.37]Okay, I get it.
[101:58.23]I get it, yep.
[102:00.47]Alright, it makes sense.
[102:06.40]Let's do the scene.
[102:11.04]Okay.
[102:13.00]Can I see it this time?
[102:13.58]No!
[102:13.64]I wanna see it.
[102:14.01]Alright, we can skip this though.
[102:15.39]Skip.
[102:15.87]Inside your bag.
[102:17.17]Playing THIS.
[102:42.08]Gilroy's brand garlic clove cigarettes?
[102:44.66]Admit you have a problem.
[102:47.61]Alright, I admit it.
[102:49.47]I am addicted.
[102:51.82]But how could anyone resist a lung full of garlic flavored smoke?
[102:57.31]They taste good.
[102:58.37]Man, they're good for you.
[103:00.03]What a hard, smart smoking choice.
[103:02.25]And they make you look so cool.
[103:04.45]Let's buy some.
[103:07.55]Remember the Flintstones?
[103:08.77]Sounds like Bessie wants her own pack of Gilroyal's brand garlic clove cigarettes.
[103:14.05]Flintstones used to do cigarette commercials.
[103:16.61]See that, boys?
[103:17.83]That is acting.
[103:21.39]Alright, here we go.
[103:22.40]Cool Germans say yeah to garlic clove cigarettes.
[103:25.36]There it is.
[103:27.96]So now, um... I don't think I can... Should I take them back, or that should do it, right?
[103:35.75]I wonder if I should, like, take them, or keep them.
[103:42.88]Do I need the liquor for anything?
[103:44.14]I feel like I could do something with the liquor.
[103:56.29]I'm not gonna put my gun in there.
[103:59.97]I'm gonna hold on to the liquor for now.
[104:01.54]Let me just get out of here.
[104:03.46]So now all the Germans are addicted to cigarettes.
[104:06.96]Right?
[104:09.38]Yeah, let's go back to the office.
[104:13.52]Let's go back to the office.
[104:22.92]Every time that happens, it's like, where did we just drive from?
[104:24.98]We just fell out of a fucking airplane.
[104:29.83]Alright.
[104:30.95]So, uh... They should be smoking cigarettes.
[104:42.18]Wait.
[104:43.84]Nah.
[104:44.60]No?
[104:46.20]A zombie's beer style.
[104:47.64]I can't do anything with that.
[104:51.44]I don't want to water that.
[104:53.04]Wait a minute.
[104:59.01]Maybe they... Let's just go back.
[105:06.05]See if anything changed over here.
[105:09.19]We're in America.
[105:14.28]Alright, so now everybody has cigarettes here.
[105:19.10]Is Jerma endorsing cigarettes again?
[105:20.90]No, I'm saying don't smoke cigarettes.
[105:22.58]Alright, let's see.
[105:27.32]Cigarettes.
[105:27.78]Why would I tell people to smoke cigarettes?
[105:34.50]So are we just killing him from the inside out?
[105:49.39]Who's the master now, Master Jorgen?
[105:52.51]Your attempts to discredit me will not work.
[105:55.53]My Z-Boys still got my back.
[105:57.94]Yeah, all the Z-Boys, all the Z-Attack back there.
[106:00.86]It's like really fucked up.
[106:02.00]It's like really distracting, the Z-Attack.
[106:04.22]Alright, so he's smoking.
[106:08.99]that jorgen creep is pretty uncool huh I heard he wears corduroy z fighting whatever it is z attack I was trying to fall back from last dream alright so he's just over here smoking cigarettes and it's killing him hey jorgen yeah should we like dare him to inhale or what I don't know what I mean we will end you jorgen
[106:37.38]And incidentally, what was the source of your power again?
[106:39.82]It is my style!
[106:41.48]The zombies love me because of my rhymes, my moves, my staying always... So he's gonna smoke and it's gonna fuck him up.
[106:49.99]Yeah, let's go.
[106:50.47]Watch this.
[106:50.87]Max and I want to challenge you.
[106:51.99]You know me.
[106:52.99]I'm Count Cryptwind Deathgrasp.
[106:55.41]And I'm Baron Batanguish the Nightmare!
[106:58.15]Okay, we already wowed you, but here's an encore.
[107:05.31]So just skip to Jurgen.
[107:09.66]And you've already heard our melancholy rhymes.
[107:12.50]So we're not going to repeat them.
[107:14.37]You know you love us.
[107:17.99]That's it?
[107:18.75]Okay, we don't have to do anything.
[107:21.29]So now he's going to be fucked up.
[107:22.27]He's going to slow down.
[107:22.91]He's going to start coughing.
[107:24.07]I hope you got something in mind here, Sam.
[107:27.65]I'm getting kind of woozy.
[107:31.27]Max has to have something in his body.
[107:33.68]I don't even know where I am.
[107:36.28]Sam, you're
[107:39.74]What?
[107:40.50]Oh.
[107:42.06]They didn't like that!
[107:42.72]That was bad!
[107:43.55]That was terrible!
[107:46.11]That was fucking awful!
[107:46.99]So, alright.
[107:49.45]So, he's already, like, kinda fucked up.
[107:51.47]Max has to, like, we have to give him something.
[107:54.06]You have to take in, like, garlic-flavored water.
[107:57.50]Or, like, holy water.
[107:59.42]Or, like, I don't know.
[108:00.32]We gotta figure out, like, how to...
[108:09.67]Get him drunk.
[108:11.77]Come here.
[108:12.62]Yeah, that makes sense.
[108:13.74]Oh, what?
[108:17.52]Come on.
[108:18.12]It has to be- it has to be water.
[108:19.96]Undead fish.
[108:22.66]I need to find, like, holy water.
[108:39.05]Yeah, hold on.
[108:41.69]Because he's not going to drink this.
[108:42.79]He'll drink the water.
[108:43.61]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[108:49.53]Games are fun.
[108:50.47]Games are fun.
[108:52.11]Video games are fucking fun.
[108:56.65]All the three-dimensional polygons and programming that require it.
[109:00.19]It's wonderful shit.
[109:00.84]There is water.
[109:10.21]I don't know if it's holy water, though.
[109:19.38]No one likes games.
[109:20.72]Games?
[109:21.12]Just like, I, yeah, fuck them.
[109:22.86]Who needs games?
[109:27.32]I don't think this is holy water.
[109:29.16]I think it's just...
[109:36.13]He was bathing in it.
[109:37.03]But if you were bathing in it, wouldn't you taste bad?
[109:38.89]This is the place where High Priest Max takes his holy baths.
[109:42.02]Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[109:43.12]But he was already covered with it.
[109:44.28]Maybe he's just consuming it.
[109:45.58]Okay, this is, yeah, got it.
[109:48.66]Sim, sim, salabim!
[109:50.78]Okay.
[109:57.70]Alright, it's time to win.
[110:10.77]So Max drinks this, he gets bit, and then all of a sudden he's just gonna pass out or something.
[110:22.72]How am I gonna get this in there?
[110:28.24]He said no hot water and no cigarettes.
[110:32.26]Just drink it before we go in, right?
[110:34.52]That's not... Will it last?
[110:39.21]Where are we headed, Sam?
[110:42.00]Let's go to Stuttgart.
[110:50.58]Make it cool on the show, yeah.
[110:54.78]Free game with holy water.
[111:00.56]I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[111:04.96]But he could also drink it and then he gets bit, but he has to drink it out here.
[111:13.87]Will he know?
[111:16.93]Let's try that.
[111:17.91]Let's try it.
[111:18.79]I feel like, but why would he just buy holy water?
[111:22.39]If it's not allowed in there.
[111:25.80]That's probably going to work.
[111:27.00]Let's see if this does it.
[111:42.52]No.
[111:42.60]Yeah.
[111:42.72]Yep.
[111:42.80]So he has to drink it outside.
[111:44.12]It was an interesting idea.
[111:45.14]I was gonna humor it, see if it would work.
[111:46.58]I'm gonna go in and he's like, has holy water vats in his room.
[112:13.00]Alright.
[112:14.52]Yeah.
[112:15.08]I'm gonna go through the original plan.
[112:18.18]Come here, you.
[112:19.90]Try this.
[112:22.60]Drink up, pal.
[112:26.25]Delicious.
[112:29.71]Let's go.
[112:31.77]Sorry, sir.
[112:32.43]You'll have to leave any hazardous items outside.
[112:34.65]Garlic cloves, cigarettes.
[112:36.25]Not allowed.
[112:37.31]Only one.
[112:41.65]I don't have garlic.
[112:42.75]See?
[112:42.89]Yeah.
[112:43.21]You guys all telling me that I was wrong.
[112:48.25]See?
[112:49.97]I can't go in there with that.
[112:50.85]Alright.
[112:51.71]Here we go.
[112:52.09]Hey, he's got a halo on his head.
[113:08.36]Max and I want to challenge you again.
[113:10.24]You know me.
[113:11.26]I'm Count Cryptwind Deathgrasp.
[113:13.66]And I'm Baron Bat Anguish von Nightmare.
[113:18.90]Alright.
[113:19.28]Fight them.
[113:20.32]And turn to fucking dust.
[113:21.78]So we're not going to repeat them.
[113:23.60]You know you love us.
[113:25.38]Yay!
[113:26.44]Yay!
[113:28.26]That's the cheater's lament.
[113:29.82]Alright.
[113:35.06]That should do it.
[113:40.00]Drag me to hell, the scarred arms.
[113:44.80]Time down below.
[113:48.00]Very soon need release.
[113:50.76]Is this a diarrhea segment?
[113:52.22]Excuse a moment.
[114:02.72]Not good.
[114:03.18]Hold your holy water, Jürgen.
[114:05.19]You dare defile my... Oh, wait.
[114:08.19]Hold on.
[114:12.97]He's going very quickly to the bathroom.
[114:16.09]That's not enough time to do anything.
[114:17.61]Didn't wash hands.
[114:19.03]Didn't wipe ass.
[114:20.22]I think that's more important.
[114:39.84]He's escaping to his inner sanctum.
[114:43.69]No, go this way!
[114:45.19]Go!
[114:45.33]Go in here!
[115:05.41]Here comes the torture chamber.
[115:06.59]Frankenstein?
[115:07.27]I'm sorry, Frankenstein.
[115:24.22]Now, your two souls will fulfill my unholy contract and I will make the entire Earth my non-stop house party of evil.
[115:37.20]And then there was the most epic battle of our entire career.
[115:40.78]Yeah, yeah, I remember the rest.
[115:42.64]So, what do we do now?
[115:43.72]Didn't feel like animating it.
[115:49.66]Gee, I got so wrapped up in the story, I forgot to think of a plan.
[115:52.80]We could make...
[116:01.88]Alright, cool, that's it well that was unpleasant I
[116:11.05]They actually kill him.
[116:11.93]What?
[116:12.05]Zombie Lincoln.
[116:39.27]Zombie Abraham Lincoln, what are you doing here?
[116:43.15]I don't know.
[116:43.81]Doesn't look like the theater.
[116:46.94]Something different about you.
[116:50.02]You're not wearing your hat.
[116:51.46]And he's got a body, and he's not 20 feet tall, and he's just come out of a grave.
[116:56.02]Yeah, why is he... This isn't our Lincoln, little buddy.
[116:58.14]Why is he a person?
[116:59.00]I know you.
[116:59.96]He was the head.
[117:02.94]How did you end up in Germany?
[117:04.60]Germany?
[117:05.74]I've never been there.
[117:07.01]Apart from my family's cemetery plot just outside Stuttgart, I have absolutely no ties to Germany whatsoever.
[117:15.02]Well, okay.
[117:16.42]There's the explanation.
[117:24.27]I just crashed the game.
[117:28.59]Autosave right.
[117:29.51]Autosave right, please.
[117:33.95]No, it autosaves like every fucking... It does.
[117:36.79]It does like every other scene.
[117:38.69]It does.
[117:41.17]Unable to create audio buffer.
[117:43.97]Nah, autosave is gonna be right here.
[117:46.78]How are you enjoying the play?
[117:48.24]What?
[117:54.04]Is this part of the game?
[117:55.12]Is this a joke?
[117:55.80]Are they making like a joke in the game?
[117:57.72]Thank you, zombie Abraham Lincoln, for helping us teach kids more about irony.
[118:05.95]I asked him, like, how the play was, and then he couldn't talk anymore.
[118:08.23]What?
[118:10.71]Want to know how the... Want to meet Sybil?
[118:16.11]Should I get out?
[118:16.81]I don't understand.
[118:17.29]Alright, hold on.
[118:17.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[118:18.49]I gotta get out of this, because...
[118:37.91]Let me save the game.
[118:40.63]Oh, fuck.
[118:42.97]No, what?
[118:44.99]Come on.
[118:47.05]The whole thing crashed.
[118:49.57]Ayayay, okay, well.
[118:54.09]Here's hoping that I tried to save it.
[118:56.94]Oh boy.
[118:59.00]It saved, it had to have, right?
[119:04.42]But it's just black.
[119:08.31]What is this?
[119:09.17]It's just black!
[119:23.21]Phew!
[119:24.33]Phew-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[119:25.61]Okay.
[119:30.60]Alright.
[119:32.06]Uh, I'm gonna, I'm actually, let me take this opportunity to go pee, because I, I just got, like, really scared, so I have to relieve myself.
[119:37.94]I'll be right back.
[121:24.84]Thank you.
[122:31.48]I just refilled this drink with some water.
[122:37.94]But... Oh, you got it from your... from Dr. Scan.
[122:42.24]I filled it up from the toilet, so it's different.
[122:43.96]No, you can't make fun of me.
[122:47.75]Alright, so this is saved.
[122:50.29]Zombie Abraham Lincoln, what are you doing here?
[122:54.17]I don't know.
[122:55.33]Okay, yeah.
[122:56.19]And he's got our body.
[122:57.17]He's in our Lincoln, little buddy.
[122:58.79]I know you.
[122:59.71]Alright, here we go.
[123:02.07]How did you end up in Germany?
[123:03.39]Don't do that again.
[123:04.89]I've never been.
[123:06.09]Apart from my family's cemetery plot.
[123:07.87]Cemetery plot, I just stood guard.
[123:09.39]Remember this one?
[123:11.27]Where's Salmon Max?
[123:11.85]Let's go.
[123:12.13]Salmon Max, freelance police.
[123:14.27]Never heard of you.
[123:17.50]So who's the head...
[123:19.79]They just announced a game called Pokémon Sleep?
[123:23.03]What is Pokémon Sleep?
[123:24.32]You just watch like Pokémon Sleep?
[123:49.00]you enjoying the play oh it's ripping but I was disappointed that boot fellow wasn't in it I hear he's quite the actor and I was hoping to see him thank you zombie Abraham Lincoln for helping us teach kids more about irony alright uh you might not be able to catch the rest of that play Mr. Lincoln want to know how it is no no don't tell me spoilers
[124:15.53]The villain was Hugh Bliss.
[124:16.79]Germs destroy the Martians.
[124:18.11]You see the Statue of Liberty.
[124:19.69]You get Jesus shot and turn into one of the Walking Dead.
[124:26.30]Uh... I mean, that's... Should we just try to, like... Well, I mean, don't we have to have... For time travel to work, don't you have to... Things have to play out exactly how they're supposed to, right?
[124:41.67]You get shot and turn into one of the Walking Dead.
[124:44.25]Well, that sounds horrible.
[124:45.81]Wait, we're not time traveling.
[124:46.73]I don't know why I let Mary keep dragging me to these things.
[124:51.19]Oh, right.
[124:51.51]We're just undead.
[124:52.25]Never mind.
[124:52.57]That's a different genre entirely.
[124:55.61]Abe, we've got a friend we'd like you to meet.
[124:57.60]She'd be perfect for you.
[124:59.20]You're a lot like her ex-boyfriend, and I've suspected for years that she's a necrophiliac.
[125:03.40]It's kismet.
[125:04.74]I'll hear no more of this.
[125:06.06]I'm a happily married... I'm a contentedly... I'm a married man.
[125:11.76]alright well it was nice seeing you what why Lincoln we gotta do some investigating why are we zombies what happened how do we get our bodies back what happened where are we you're gonna try to kill us do we eat this guy sorry sir Mr. president I can't understand you never learned to speak zombie would have been useful in retrospect
[125:39.66]Yes, sir.
[125:40.30]It is warm for this time of year.
[125:44.74]I don't agree, sir.
[125:45.84]The advantages of a common currency like the euro outweigh any nationalist concerns.
[125:51.09]Alright.
[125:52.33]I think we might need a translator.
[125:53.67]The factory does not have free wireless internet access.
[125:58.13]How do we get back to normal?
[125:59.19]That depends, sir.
[126:00.19]In terms of geographic area or population density.
[126:04.29]Yeah.
[126:10.27]What are we supposed to do now?
[126:11.61]Well, I think we have to just go back in here.
[126:13.46]Wait, can we actually have a conversation with the zombies now?
[126:16.40]What's going on here?
[126:28.47]Oh, you're the Americans, right?
[126:31.11]Thanks for the brain, guy.
[126:33.11]Hey, Max.
[126:34.11]We can understand the zombies now.
[126:36.69]It was as good as my nana's homemade Kimmelsplaner schnitzel.
[126:40.24]I think understand is a bit extreme, Sam.
[126:44.33]Okay, so, uh, what happened?
[126:46.19]Jurgen put us in some big machine and then we ended up here.
[126:49.65]Oh, yeah, guy.
[126:51.11]You're totally dead now, okay?
[126:53.61]But we're the freelance police.
[126:55.22]We can't die.
[126:56.72]I know, eh?
[126:58.18]None of us can.
[126:59.42]It's extremely excellent.
[127:01.24]Okay.
[127:03.96]We've got to overthrow Jurgen and get our souls back.
[127:07.06]Overthrow the, eh, what?
[127:08.99]No way, boy.
[127:10.17]The zombie factory's where it's at, friend.
[127:16.58]Don't you want revenge?
[127:18.24]Yeah, what is this accent?
[127:19.12]He's doing like Jerma, but then he's shifting over to surfer.
[127:42.00]How do we get back to normal?
[127:43.34]We're not cut out to be zombies.
[127:45.02]Yet another of my life's ambitions down the crapper.
[127:48.20]Yeah, I could tell.
[127:49.43]You shamba like you've still got your souls.
[127:53.89]Glad you liked the brain we gave you.
[127:56.07]Oh yeah, it was delicious.
[127:58.31]He must have been really smart.
[128:01.64]We don't have any more, so... Alright, so wait, can we drive?
[128:03.22]American style.
[128:03.74]Alright.
[128:30.27]Well, if it's all the same to you, pal, we're still taking down Jürgen.
[128:34.00]Oh, okay.
[128:34.92]Save me the wishbone, eh?
[128:38.04]Eh?
[128:40.02]Save me the wishbone, eh?
[128:42.32]How do we get our souls back?
[128:43.98]Don't know.
[128:45.20]They say Jürgen does something with them, but I've never been in the VIP lounge.
[128:51.27]Alright.
[128:52.13]VIP lounge.
[128:52.79]Catching you later on the flip side, zombie brother.
[128:58.26]Did we leave anything in here?
[128:59.72]There's a bottle of holy water in here.
[129:01.06]We probably can't touch that.
[129:03.74]Sorry, sir.
[129:04.30]Garlic cloves... What if we drink it?
[129:05.88]Holy... Can I... Sam, come here.
[129:08.20]No, I want to save this after Max went to all that... Max, come here.
[129:20.49]Holy... How does that make any sense?
[129:26.35]You...
[129:28.16]Alright.
[129:30.90]Angel zombie.
[129:33.40]Heavenly zombie.
[129:34.32]I want to see what the reactions are in here.
[129:37.11]See what happens when we're going.
[129:44.27]When does holy water work on zombies?
[129:46.83]Well, a vampire, like, bit us.
[129:48.87]I don't know.
[129:49.99]Isn't that how it works?
[129:54.74]Let's talk to these guys now.
[130:00.88]paper excuse me eat bullets chump I guess you have to be a zombie to appreciate how good Flint is at killing him the man's a consummate professional alright which one of you undead creeps is gonna tell me where you got salmon mats where over here what happened I feel the original sin again the holy water wore off
[130:26.69]Did you make a no-no while I wasn't looking?
[130:29.09]No, honest, Sam.
[130:30.03]It just wore off.
[130:32.31]Okay, so let's do a little introduction here.
[130:35.67]Is he not going to recognize us?
[130:36.89]No, not you guys, too.
[130:38.47]Hate to do this, fellas, but Sam and Max always said they'd rather die than become one of those things.
[130:43.94]I don't remember ever saying that.
[130:46.36]Did you, Max?
[130:47.48]Nah, I'm pretty sure he was making that part up.
[130:52.18]Not a good shot.
[130:55.11]Not a good shot at all.
[130:56.85]And, oh, he's, he's, he's now, can they not die?
[130:59.69]Just like, dance here?
[131:01.57]Alright, what a... He just keeps killing them over and over again.
[131:08.57]Alright, well, what about the Inner Sanctum?
[131:14.44]What's going on out here?
[131:15.26]Is Lincoln alright?
[131:16.06]This is Lincoln's brain.
[131:22.06]So we can't go near it.
[131:23.02]Alright, what if we... Can we make him, like, drink?
[131:25.80]Here, take this.
[131:29.80]Want some, like, booze?
[131:30.46]Do I have a gun still?
[131:33.05]No, we can't go over there.
[131:33.79]Alright, well...
[131:55.85]Can we shine a light in his eyes?
[131:56.83]Ugh, smells like musky cobwebs and half-digested corn dogs in here.
[132:10.80]I wonder if I can, like, shoot him.
[132:11.70]I got nothing to do with the cobwebs.
[132:14.91]Or, like, shine it over here.
[132:19.26]Alright.
[132:19.78]Shine it.
[132:21.12]Over in his eyes.
[132:21.82]Can't, like, drop it or shoot it or... What do you mean you don't want to break it?
[132:30.17]Well, we're gonna have to... Maybe try the DJ board?
[132:48.00]I wonder if I can, like, aim it in his eyes?
[132:56.70]No.
[132:58.14]No.
[132:59.66]No.
[133:01.04]No.
[133:01.20]It's only on the dance floor.
[133:04.16]Well, let me just go into the inner sanctum.
[133:17.44]He does have a lot of bullets.
[133:20.14]Oh, great.
[133:21.00]They're back.
[133:22.18]Keep quiet and stand still.
[133:23.88]Maybe they won't notice us.
[133:25.42]Hey, look, Max.
[133:26.46]It's vaguely ethereal versions of ourselves.
[133:29.00]Are they ghosts?
[133:30.48]No, probably just those soul things we keep hearing about.
[133:33.24]Well, what do you know?
[133:34.34]I do have one.
[133:35.74]Come to papa.
[133:36.64]Did it just go back in?
[133:37.72]I don't think so.
[133:39.68]Right.
[133:40.20]You guys run along and play.
[133:41.88]We'll be over here until our ride comes.
[133:45.01]What?
[133:46.92]Why don't you want to get back together?
[133:49.68]Looks like a delicate piece of high-precision medical equipment.
[133:54.74]Never die batteries.
[133:56.28]They're dead.
[133:58.61]Okay.
[133:59.39]Alchemy machine.
[134:00.67]I bet my lifetime subscription to the Fortean Times that that's an alchemy machine.
[134:07.25]Okay.
[134:08.69]Monster diagrams.
[134:09.43]We're going to have to do some potion or something.
[134:10.85]These diagrams are so scientific.
[134:13.37]I couldn't possibly make sense of them.
[134:17.96]Jurgen's monster.
[134:18.93]We need Abraham Lincoln's brain to go in here.
[134:20.77]This is odd.
[134:21.05]Yeah, that's odd.
[134:43.29]Who the fuck is this guy?
[134:45.03]Can you help us?
[134:46.13]Oh well
[135:03.71]And I sucked the horror right out of it, huh?
[135:08.05]Alright, hey, let's talk.
[135:10.73]Hiya, gruesome.
[135:11.79]You're not Master Jurgen.
[135:14.52]Who are you?
[135:16.66]A mob of angry villagers.
[135:18.82]Zombie ninja monkey pirates.
[135:21.36]Prismatologists.
[135:22.96]We're from the Church of Prismatology, offering a completely free session to test your bliss level with our patented blissometers.
[135:29.09]Well, it's not very blissful in this dungeon.
[135:33.35]Leave the science to the professionals, pal.
[135:36.03]Now bend over.
[135:37.51]We're just kidding.
[135:38.69]We're your creators.
[135:40.09]Master Jurgen is my creator.
[135:42.47]Oh, did he?
[135:42.85]Well, we pulled the switch.
[135:44.09]Yeah, we turned you on.
[135:45.41]And I wish you hadn't.
[135:47.20]The sleep of unlife was preferable to the bitter pang of loneliness.
[135:53.40]Alright.
[135:55.78]Why so glum, chum?
[135:57.04]Do you have any idea what it's like being a misshapen freak?
[136:01.43]It sucks!
[136:02.13]That's a deep, deep level of, uh, meaning there.
[136:18.00]We've got the perfect bride.
[136:20.14]You're in luck, buddy.
[136:21.30]We've got the perfect bride for you.
[136:23.18]Master Jurgen promised the same thing long ago.
[136:27.72]But ours is ready to go right out of the box.
[136:30.37]No assembly required.
[136:32.31]Sounds intriguing.
[136:37.09]Let's go meet Sybil.
[136:39.33]Say antipasto.
[136:40.63]Why?
[136:41.41]Hey, monster, what's the Italian word for an appetizer?
[136:44.61]Antipasto.
[136:48.82]Hey, Monster, what do you call a ham and cheese sandwich that's been breaded and deep fried?
[136:53.40]Monte Cristo.
[136:57.57]Hey, Monster.
[136:58.61]Wait, let me do one.
[137:00.27]What California coast city is home to Cal Poly University?
[137:03.53]Hmm.
[137:05.56]Coalinga?
[137:09.24]Monsters are awesome.
[137:09.90]What's so bad about being a monster?
[137:11.92]Master Jurgen only built one.
[137:15.30]I am alone.
[137:17.96]You've got us!
[137:19.32]Please kill me.
[137:22.66]Let's go meet Sybil.
[137:23.52]Let's go introduce you to our friend Sybil.
[137:25.58]I can't go like this.
[137:27.60]What woman could be attracted to someone as incomplete as I am?
[137:31.89]What do you need?
[137:32.47]Yeah, trust us.
[137:33.59]Sybil's used to guys who aren't all there.
[137:36.18]All the same, I must be fully assembled before I go.
[137:39.84]Alright.
[137:40.54]I thought you took forever to get ready, Sam.
[137:44.92]He needs an arm.
[137:46.03]He needs an arm.
[137:49.23]What's your job around here?
[137:50.61]Do you kill stuff, or are you mostly decking?
[137:52.73]Brain from Lincoln.
[137:53.85]Master Jurgen created me to prove his ultimate victory over life and death.
[137:58.99]Never thinking that he'd have to feed you and walk you every day.
[138:01.95]Typical.
[138:05.15]Alright.
[138:06.15]You don't like it, do you?
[138:07.01]Checklist.
[138:07.77]Heart.
[138:07.99]On the operating table.
[138:21.18]Okay, what's the plan?
[138:22.26]Looks like me.
[138:22.94]Doesn't look like me.
[138:23.58]Nyah!
[138:23.76]Nyah!
[138:44.43]Alright, operating table.
[138:45.97]We've got, we need body pots.
[138:47.97]Let's see what he's got.
[138:48.87]What do we got for body pots?
[138:53.95]Alright, egg beater.
[138:59.25]Foam finger.
[139:00.95]Computer chip stone.
[139:02.26]Oh, let me fucking throw this.
[139:04.42]Heart choke heart.
[139:06.06]Okay.
[139:06.38]And, uh...
[139:17.01]Foam finger for the hand?
[139:18.21]No.
[139:18.27]Egg beater?
[139:21.40]Computer chip for the brain?
[139:22.18]Shut up.
[139:22.54]No, no.
[139:22.66]What about egg beater?
[139:49.12]No.
[139:49.54]Feather duster.
[139:51.60]Clock.
[139:52.32]Anywhere else?
[139:55.76]I need, like, a rock.
[140:00.87]I think we need something.
[140:02.13]Cauliflower.
[140:02.81]No.
[140:02.99]Um, no.
[140:03.19]No.
[140:14.26]Yes, that's much better.
[140:16.94]I'd operate at a much greater efficiency if you'd install Linux.
[140:20.42]Clock heart.
[140:21.52]Yes, sir.
[140:22.10]Clock heart.
[140:23.92]Oh, no.
[140:24.60]I've overslept.
[140:25.80]I'm late.
[140:26.28]I'm late.
[140:28.18]I don't think any of this shit is supposed to be here.
[140:30.10]What about a rock?
[140:31.00]Can we hurry this up, guys?
[140:33.49]I've got a dozen foreclosures to get caught up on today, and that's just the orphanages.
[140:42.67]I think we just need to get it right.
[140:46.06]Alright, we're gonna leave this for now.
[140:47.44]I think we're missing stuff.
[140:53.60]Gages.
[140:53.76]Let's just turn him off.
[141:14.05]Yeah, we definitely need to get the brain.
[141:18.89]So, we need to get the brain to put in their power socket.
[141:21.07]What is that?
[141:24.89]We need to charge the batteries.
[141:26.93]We need to strike the lightning on the battery.
[141:28.97]We need the brain.
[141:35.83]The soul sucker.
[141:36.65]There's a television here?
[141:43.57]What else is over here?
[141:44.37]Alchemy book.
[141:45.85]Just look around.
[141:47.77]And Coulter, a life.
[141:50.63]Alchemy for beginners.
[141:52.72]Jurgen made it up to chapter 14.
[141:53.98]Turning chocolate to gold.
[141:56.94]Oh, but build me a machine that turns gold nuggets to chicken nuggets and we shall have power unlimited.
[142:04.37]Burn it!
[142:04.85]Yeah!
[142:05.01]Just put a bike lock on it and say, tell us how to get our souls back.
[142:25.31]Okay, fun's fun, but get back in here.
[142:27.55]I'm already tired of being a zombie.
[142:29.93]Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you treated me so abominably.
[142:33.21]Maybe now we'll get the appreciation we deserve.
[142:36.76]Crispy chicken nuggets.
[142:38.24]What's your beef against us?
[142:40.10]He never paid attention to me.
[142:41.96]I could go for some extra crispy.
[142:43.52]We'll force you back in if we have to.
[142:45.36]You can't make us do anything.
[142:48.92]Okay.
[142:51.16]We need to get the...
[142:52.99]We've got to get the brain from Lincoln and put it in this dude.
[142:56.45]We also need to get some kind of heart or... Go in?
[142:58.61]Oh, you can't die twice.
[143:03.78]Okay.
[143:04.26]So what do I... I have bolt cutters...
[143:19.10]steaks looks like a trophy case from all the vampire hunters who've tried to defeat Jordan how do you like your steak max okay another steak shoot doesn't do anything alright so I have some items here uh let me see if there's anything I can do
[143:45.40]Up with the guy shooting the zombies.
[143:47.04]Maybe put the stakes in their hearts?
[143:49.14]No, those are vampires, these are zombies.
[143:50.98]I'm mixing genres.
[143:59.54]Just for shits, though.
[144:01.66]Like, does this do anything?
[144:03.51]Like, will he stop shooting if I stab them?
[144:06.01]Yeah, I know.
[144:07.31]What about the axe?
[144:10.69]Can I do anything with the axe?
[144:14.14]Hmm.
[144:14.64]Liquor.
[144:30.29]Typewriter.
[144:36.97]Nothing else in here.
[144:37.81]Alright, I need some stuff.
[144:41.06]I need to find some stuff.
[144:42.12]I feel like it's not here.
[144:46.16]I can't get the brain.
[144:49.67]The brain is... He shoots at you if you go click on it.
[144:59.05]Wow, the cops actually installed something well for once.
[145:02.53]I won't be able to just pull it off.
[145:04.85]Can I do that?
[145:06.97]Look away, Max.
[145:08.25]This is the kind of vandalism that turns your stomach.
[145:11.04]Nonsense.
[145:11.88]I embrace all kinds of vandalism.
[145:14.87]Now I'm going to electrocute this.
[145:17.94]Hold on.
[145:22.30]Is it an illegal item?
[145:23.08]No, get out of my way!
[145:37.89]I'm not even walking towards you.
[145:38.81]I mean, I am technically walking towards you.
[145:46.50]Yeah, why would the stakes not be illegal?
[145:47.92]I have to power this.
[145:59.15]And I power this by sticking this in here.
[146:04.49]And then striking it with lightning, so then the batteries are charged, and then take the battery...
[146:09.63]And, wait, how do I turn, how do I make this, strike this?
[146:12.55]Will it, or is it going to strike him?
[146:13.69]Now, the table works.
[146:14.37]Interesting.
[146:14.61]It's like, can I do anything with this yet?
[146:16.21]Or did I just kind of, hmm.
[146:17.41]It's an alchemy machine.
[146:37.40]What about... Can I turn... Can I turn liquor into gold?
[146:40.42]Gold.
[146:40.76]It'll just turn it gold.
[146:41.56]I need... Hold on.
[146:43.45]Gold.
[146:45.81]It just turns it to... Hold on.
[146:46.97]Gold stone?
[146:47.23]Gold stone?
[147:07.67]No, I need something else.
[147:13.69]I can't pick any of this stuff up.
[147:20.40]James Bond?
[147:22.80]No, that's been done before.
[147:27.68]Alright, well, I think that's all I can do here.
[147:31.96]I don't see anything else.
[147:33.48]I think I've set it up.
[147:39.04]Let me go back to the real world.
[147:49.62]Germany's the fake world.
[147:51.48]No, no.
[147:53.42]We're very much in a fantasy land right now.
[147:55.84]Like a castle with like Dracula and zombies and shit.
[147:59.60]I'm talking about like non-fantasy.
[148:02.94]It's like New York.
[148:03.71]We're just like on a street.
[148:04.67]Not like in a castle.
[148:07.68]Castles equal fake.
[148:09.92]Castles like this don't, yes, but not fake, fiction.
[148:13.98]Okay, let's get back to non-fiction, okay?
[148:16.22]Does that make you happier?
[148:18.17]Let's get back to non-fiction.
[148:20.71]Are zombies allowed to drive cars?
[148:23.01]I don't see why not.
[148:24.21]My license is just as expired now as it was when we were alive.
[148:29.85]Yeah, let's head back home.
[148:32.78]Gothic Germany, you can speak.
[148:34.28]No, but, like, the vampire living in, like, the Dracula castle is fiction.
[148:39.14]New York City, this is non-fiction here.
[148:41.21]This is a spree.
[148:42.79]That's what I meant.
[148:46.13]Come back here, you stupid hand!
[148:48.85]Vampires are non-fiction.
[148:52.23]I don't... Shoot.
[148:54.13]I'm not even gonna give that a response.
[148:58.08]Talk to me.
[148:58.94]This parking meter could withstand anything.
[149:02.50]Well, there's the hand.
[149:03.42]What do we got here?
[149:04.26]Just stab him through the heart and get it over with.
[149:06.82]Can I pick this up?
[149:07.60]So I'm a zombie, so it could be my beer stein, right?
[149:11.86]I wish I could put the liquor in there.
[149:13.82]Not happening.
[149:31.14]Can I do anything over here?
[149:32.02]Yeah, this is just here for fun.
[149:35.82]Okay.
[149:38.32]Rats only.
[149:39.12]What about in here?
[149:39.56]So we're looking for a heart.
[149:42.02]The brain is Lincoln's brain, obviously.
[149:43.98]We're looking for a heart and a hand.
[149:48.24]The hand, like, just ran that way.
[149:50.88]So we're looking for a heart.
[149:55.95]No, not the bear head.
[150:07.71]Frog machine?
[150:10.74]Wait, what is this?
[150:11.38]I need to see this.
[150:15.30]In Spanish, frogs are called frijoles.
[150:18.64]Which explains why I eat them with rice.
[150:23.68]Take the banang.
[150:26.02]Banang.
[150:27.06]Tastes great and fun to say.
[150:28.84]Okay.
[150:32.02]I don't see any heart stuff in here.
[150:37.47]This is the machines I don't see any body parts in here
[151:06.22]The hand did run into Stinkies.
[151:10.28]Just checking, just checking, just checking.
[151:14.06]Kill Leonard.
[151:17.05]You can't kill him.
[151:18.23]Hey, Leonard.
[151:24.57]That's only good for vampires and tents.
[151:26.89]Stake him.
[151:28.87]Oh, horrible.
[151:31.15]That's too gruesome even for a zombie to do.
[151:36.48]I don't want to waste it on him.
[151:41.84]Hey, Leonard.
[151:43.17]Alright.
[151:51.89]Let's go into the restaurant.
[151:54.31]Whee!
[151:55.95]An arm just ran in there.
[151:59.73]Into the stinkies.
[152:03.53]Help!
[152:04.35]Someone, help!
[152:07.21]Whoa!
[152:07.93]That was... I don't know why, but for a second I was like, holy shit, they just murdered her.
[152:16.49]Okay, so another case of somebody shooting a gun at us.
[152:20.81]Pie.
[152:21.23]Sticky goo.
[152:33.43]Okay, so let's put the steak in there.
[152:40.65]Let's throw that into him.
[152:42.44]Let's shoot at the hand.
[152:45.52]No, he's too quick.
[152:46.36]Shoot at the goo.
[152:49.16]Shoot at... I want to throw goo.
[153:02.70]It's just a pie.
[153:03.72]It's not something you really talk about.
[153:06.28]It's Stinky's gooey molasses tar cake.
[153:09.36]I can't, like, touch it.
[153:15.34]Can I just walk around?
[153:17.56]I guess I can keep going this way.
[153:18.94]Can you give us a hand here?
[153:24.85]Oh, great.
[153:28.75]Zombies.
[153:29.61]As if my day couldn't get any worse.
[153:34.19]Well... Um... Maybe I'm missing something.
[153:49.56]Anything over here I can grab or do?
[153:56.50]Behind.
[153:57.32]Coffee pot.
[153:58.50]Something to fall.
[153:59.45]Something to throw.
[154:01.33]Typewriter ribbon.
[154:01.95]I can't, like, dip anything in there?
[154:25.17]Nooo, I don't know what to do!
[154:29.68]Maybe I can't do anything in here yet.
[154:31.22]Let's go to Sibyl's?
[154:38.80]Why ain't I shooting at Max?
[155:07.05]Wait.
[155:07.73]Oh.
[155:08.45]Oh, okay.
[155:09.17]I got it.
[155:12.37]Shoot me.
[155:13.99]No, no, no.
[155:14.31]This way.
[155:14.63]Shoot me.
[155:25.32]Do it!
[155:25.52]Dump it over there!
[155:47.91]Oh!
[155:48.41]What?
[155:48.99]Oh, come on.
[155:49.91]That's bullshit.
[155:50.37]I'll take the hand.
[155:51.19]What the fuck?
[156:18.53]Come here.
[156:22.43]Now we need... a heart.
[156:26.62]We need something that can be a heart.
[156:30.22]Sibyls?
[156:32.76]Wait, can we, like, untie you?
[156:33.96]I'm kind of just leaving you hanging.
[156:43.20]We don't serve zombies in here.
[156:45.58]Do you have any idea how expensive brains are?
[156:50.27]I'm trying to help you.
[156:52.67]I can't cut you out.
[156:53.43]You look like a pinecone.
[156:56.15]Well, alright.
[156:56.77]Fine.
[157:03.98]Eat my brain.
[157:05.00]See if I care.
[157:05.90]It's all pointless now anyway.
[157:10.87]Let's go check on Sibyl.
[157:14.10]I got the hand.
[157:20.94]Eat again soon.
[157:23.42]I'll try.
[157:23.95]Anything new going on in here?
[157:30.31]Any items?
[157:30.93]Any hearts?
[157:32.35]Any body parts?
[157:38.30]Oh, hey, guys.
[157:40.92]You haven't seen this.
[157:43.10]You did.
[157:44.12]You've narrowed it down to these two.
[157:45.48]God.
[157:45.58]Gifts.
[158:05.50]Now it's down to two.
[158:06.14]I want that soul matter.
[158:17.70]I know, Sam.
[158:18.80]I'll use it once I've narrowed it down to one finest.
[158:21.57]Alright, so we gotta get the brain and the heart.
[158:26.17]Gotta bring the entire Wizard of Oz movie to Frankenstein.
[158:29.13]Frankenstein comes in here.
[158:31.11]They hit it off.
[158:32.23]They fall in love.
[158:33.03]We get the soul matter.
[158:33.93]Bring the soul matter back to the castle.
[158:36.98]Bang.
[158:37.34]Roll the credits.
[158:38.74]Let's just get it done.
[158:48.56]Okay.
[158:52.61]I still can't get him here.
[158:57.55]Can I talk to any of the other zombies?
[159:02.72]Okay, you don't have anything to say.
[159:09.12]Go back, go back, go back, go back.
[159:10.58]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[159:13.06]Whoa, whoa.
[159:16.37]Oh my god, help, easy!
[159:23.96]Bolt cutters on door?
[159:25.88]Why is everybody screaming this?
[159:31.36]Tell me again?
[159:34.26]Oh, tell me again?
[159:35.68]What do you need again?
[159:38.04]Okay.
[159:42.71]Should I try it one more time?
[159:45.69]Before I get screamed at again.
[159:49.39]Okay.
[159:59.46]Oh, we baited him.
[160:00.68]See, you can't pull that.
[160:02.37]You can't pull that on me.
[160:07.09]Okay, is there anything in here?
[160:11.03]Tattoos.
[160:13.47]Sign.
[160:14.01]Anything on the fox?
[160:18.03]No, the fox is innocent.
[160:29.53]I'll take that.
[160:32.01]I'm about to bolt cutter this guy.
[160:35.75]Okay.
[160:38.23]Like... Come here, Harry.
[160:51.65]Come on.
[160:52.61]How do I get rid of you?
[160:53.73]There it is.
[160:54.31]Right there.
[160:57.40]Fuck.
[160:57.64]Okay.
[161:24.84]Now serving 46.
[161:26.82]Now serving 47.
[161:27.53]This is Diana here.
[161:29.47]Where are we heading, Sam?
[161:30.11]+2!
[161:30.35]+2!
[161:30.79]+2!
[161:31.26]+2!
[161:31.64]+2!
[161:32.20]+2!
[161:32.60]Let's go to Stuttgart.
[161:46.83]Let's at least give it a hand.
[161:48.49]It's taking up inventory space.
[161:49.79]I hate when... You know when you're playing Diablo II?
[161:52.91]And you gotta go back to town, you gotta play with some space.
[161:58.37]That one went well.
[161:59.19]Stop!
[161:59.37]I just turned...
[162:16.25]Stop doing the Resident Evil camera thing, where you get to a certain threshold, and it just... You have to go, ah, yeah.
[162:21.87]I'm not playing Diablo Mobile.
[162:25.43]Is that game ever gonna release?
[162:27.80]Or do you think that this internally just, like, put it in the, like, incinerator?
[162:43.52]Hiya, gruesome.
[162:44.84]Alright, come here.
[162:49.90]Body parts.
[162:52.88]Alright, you have a hand now.
[163:02.47]You got the chip in there.
[163:03.81]You're alright.
[163:04.67]You're ready to go.
[163:05.25]Let's go.
[163:07.99]Hiya, gruesome.
[163:10.24]Let's go meet our friend Sybil.
[163:11.92]It's a frightfully long drive, isn't it?
[163:14.64]Are you sure you want to go now?
[163:18.01]Yes.
[163:18.77]Yes, let's go right now.
[163:20.45]Quickly, before Sam gets distracted and... Oh, more switches!
[163:24.95]Well, I never travel without my belongings.
[163:28.53]Just throw them in the trunk already.
[163:30.01]We're wasting daylight.
[163:30.95]Alright, let's get there.
[163:32.53]Thanks for coming, gentlemen.
[163:34.11]I know it's difficult for you to travel, having to carry all your stuff with you.
[163:38.64]I'm used to it.
[163:40.29]Well, until I figure out how the Soul Mater works, I'm going to have to do this the old-fashioned way.
[163:45.76]I'll ask each of you three lucky bachelors a series of questions.
[163:50.28]Based on your answers, I'll decide which one of you advances to the final round of being my boyfriend.
[163:58.58]Definitely weird.
[164:01.13]What, we're just in here?
[164:02.91]Alright, well...
[164:30.50]Why did I put my finger in his mouth?
[164:36.97]I put my finger in his mouth.
[164:39.73]Alright.
[164:46.18]Let's see.
[164:46.52]What other questions?
[164:47.40]Let's see.
[164:48.22]Which question should I ask?
[164:50.66]I don't know.
[164:51.00]Question two?
[164:51.50]Two?
[164:58.06]I can't read that.
[164:59.24]Question one.
[165:01.75]Good idea, Sam.
[165:03.71]I'll ask this one.
[165:05.57]Bachelor number one.
[165:07.23]My last boyfriend was a real jerk.
[165:10.05]I'm looking for a man who's kind, upstanding, good to everyone, and never cruel.
[165:16.59]Prove to me you've got a heart of gold.
[165:20.57]I love the spirit of all the Earth's creatures I need that heart the tiny bean sprout I can't touch it mighty sequoia the tibetan yeah let's move on number two same question I am as you know the go-to performer for troubled characters with a heart of gold landlords lawmen gangsters nuns hookers and pimps I've played them all big phony got it and bachelor number three prove to me

[166:22.01]How do I get rid of you?
[166:25.68]Like, we have to ask a question that he doesn't know.
[166:30.73]Question three.
[166:31.53]He's gonna freak out.
[166:39.09]The only thing I liked about my last boyfriend was that he had a way with words.
[166:44.26]He always just knew the right thing to say.
[166:46.96]What would you say to me in a romantic moment?
[166:50.80]I would say, let me optimize your inner loop so that we can focus on debugging.
[166:58.54]And bachelor number two?
[167:00.14]I would quote from my award-winning one-act play, The Cloaca Monologues, to wit.
[167:06.36]Oh, no, that's quite alright.
[167:07.61]He's got the computer brain right now.
[167:08.51]Bachelor number three, same question.
[167:10.81]What would you say to me in a romantic moment?
[167:15.66]Here it comes.
[167:16.60]Most romantic thing to say.
[167:22.08]Well, that's a good question.
[167:25.45]I feel like he's stuck now.
[167:26.99]No, wait, was he stuck and not taking it?
[167:29.45]Is he stuck?
[167:30.05]Yeah, I've heard enough.
[167:32.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can take it.
[167:33.85]Do it again, do it again, do it again, I can get it.
[167:37.72]Bachelor number one.
[167:40.56]Hmm, most romantic thing to say.
[167:47.29]It's not right.
[167:48.27]You're out.
[167:48.77]You're out.
[167:49.31]Dumb motherfucker.
[168:14.77]Get out of here.
[168:16.21]Get out of here.
[168:17.03]And then slam the fucking door.
[168:45.67]Alright, so we need to... Hold on.
[168:51.03]So, I need to turn this into gold.
[168:53.29]At the alchemy table.
[168:55.05]And then we need Lincoln's brain.
[168:59.15]He's no longer protecting the door.
[169:01.97]So, what... Can I... Can I bring something in?
[169:10.05]I think we need to go back.
[169:10.75]We gotta go back to the lab anyways.
[169:17.30]I don't think I can take anything.
[169:18.53]Yeah, let's go back to the lab.
[169:25.41]Let's head back to Stuttgart.
[169:26.99]Uh, yes.
[169:27.45]I want to put that heart in.
[169:29.01]Put the heart in.
[169:31.13]He's got the hand and he's the Lincoln Brain.
[169:46.74]Let's turn it to gold.
[169:51.64]Chocolate.
[169:53.72]Goldify it.
[169:54.45]+2 does not mean a bad joke.
[170:01.33]You're being sarcastic.
[170:03.19]You did the smiley face.
[170:13.26]Can we just put it in?
[170:16.74]Okay, that's it.
[170:21.58]The arm is there, the heart is there.
[170:23.66]We just need the brain.
[170:29.12]Yep, so it's in there.
[170:32.98]Looks good.
[170:35.54]No, I'm not gonna put rock brain.
[170:37.10]We need Lincoln's brain, but I need to figure out how to get that guy out of here.
[170:42.59]I think I just hit a wall.
[170:45.68]Because I did everything I had items for.
[170:51.58]Put rock in brain.
[170:52.68]They're not gonna stop.
[171:04.05]Like, you guys know they're not gonna stop.
[171:13.88]Give him a gold rock brain.
[171:16.82]Alright, well, Super Ball is no longer at the door, so I feel like that's part of it.
[171:28.77]So let's go back and bring what's in the trash right now.
[171:36.46]Are the cigarettes in the trash?
[171:41.10]That has to be something.
[171:50.93]Nobody guarding the door.
[171:55.51]There's a bottle of holy water in here.
[171:56.87]Bottle of holy water.
[171:59.53]It's empty.
[172:00.19]That's it.
[172:01.87]I can bring the... Where are the cigarettes?
[172:04.33]Are the cigarettes back at the TV studio?
[172:11.24]Cigarettes are like back in the TV studio.
[172:16.70]I feel like the malt liquor would give it to that guy.
[172:30.77]The axe is like I chopped the head off or something.
[172:36.90]Well, I can bring this in.
[172:37.94]Let me just see.
[172:38.88]Can I give it to him?
[172:44.85]Like, will he just shoot me?
[172:48.08]Nah, I want to save this after Mac.
[172:50.14]Alright, Max, get over here.
[172:54.78]Why am I milking this stream?
[172:56.12]What are you talking about?
[172:59.53]Just playing the game.
[173:04.51]Holy!
[173:07.75]Hey, Flint, can you help us out here?
[173:09.61]Zombies!
[173:11.54]No, he doesn't think... He still... He won't look at Max.
[173:22.47]How do I make it so I can pick that up?
[173:24.93]Can I, like, bolt cutter this and drop it on his head?
[173:39.43]They just don't stay down.
[173:40.91]Much like Stinky's food.
[173:45.15]Let me see if I can bolt cut that.
[173:46.49]Bolt cut.
[173:46.99]I don't think I tried this.
[174:00.66]That doesn't need cutting.
[174:01.84]No.
[174:12.69]There's a poem inscribed on this bookcase.
[174:14.67]Poem.
[174:14.79]Can't read it.
[174:15.17]It's been worn down.
[174:21.72]Will that work?
[174:24.73]I'm pretty sure this is useless.
[174:26.43]No.
[174:31.11]Talk to the zombies?
[174:34.94]What's going on?
[174:35.82]This American came in suddenly shooting everyone.
[174:39.04]He's a crazy man.
[174:40.68]What's the big deal?
[174:41.66]You guys get right back up.
[174:43.48]Yeah, but it stings.
[174:45.60]It'll probably get infected.
[174:52.05]Stop the violence!
[174:55.31]We're trying.
[174:56.07]I'm trying to stop the violence.
[174:57.45]That's the intention here.
[175:06.34]Uh... Pipewriter ribbon.
[175:22.55]Yeah, I... Why is everybody talking about the book piece?
[175:26.08]Yeah, I know there's a poem up here, but I can't read it.
[175:28.30]I already tried this.
[175:30.98]It doesn't do anything.
[175:34.88]There's a ball?
[175:35.54]Clean it?
[175:36.36]Like, throw holy water at it?
[175:37.62]Nah, I want to save this after Max went to all that trouble sanctifying it.
[175:46.34]Nope.
[175:47.78]I don't think I can clean that.
[175:55.35]Can I, like, shine light on it?
[176:04.30]It was lead.
[176:04.68]Looks like a trophy case.
[176:23.69]Literature.
[176:24.13]Oh, it's behind his head.
[176:25.03]Pain.
[176:25.17]Parents.
[176:25.39]Pain.
[176:25.53]Abyss.
[176:25.71]Pain.
[176:25.87]Parents.
[176:26.09]Razors.
[176:28.21]Abyss.
[176:28.35]Razors.
[176:28.59]Pain.
[176:28.95]Parents.
[176:29.19]Abyss.
[176:29.35]Razors.
[176:29.71]Pain.
[176:30.07]Parents.
[176:30.49]Abyss.
[176:30.61]Razors.
[176:30.83]Pain.
[176:30.97]Parents.
[176:31.21]Abyss.
[176:31.33]Razors.
[176:31.61]Pain.
[176:32.33]Parents.
[176:32.93]Abyss.
[176:33.89]Razors.
[176:34.13]Pain.
[176:34.27]Parents.
[176:54.06]Abyss, Razors, Pain.
[176:55.34]Apparently I got it.
[176:57.18]And that'll shine the light in his face probably.
[176:58.78]At least I hope so.
[177:05.89]Abyss.
[177:08.35]Abyss.
[177:09.55]Razors.
[177:11.33]Razors.
[177:12.43]Pain.
[177:19.30]Pain.
[177:20.58]Parents.
[177:23.22]Parents.
[177:27.14]Look, Sam.
[177:28.26]I did not expect that thing over there to open.
[177:31.64]Okay, cool.
[177:33.66]So we can go in here.
[177:34.59]And is that going to probably take us to the other bookcase?
[177:41.63]Why is the floor so sticky?
[177:43.43]There's going to be a single possible answer to that question that I like.
[177:49.25]He did the thing I've been telling him to do for an hour.
[177:52.97]What, why do you, what, you just want me to cheat and just look at every answer?
[177:59.05]Ah, too bad I didn't, like, cheat and raid it immediately.
[178:01.29]Raiding one guy.
[178:18.99]Yeah, but like... I can't believe it.
[178:21.89]He's trying to figure out this puzzle.
[178:23.07]You should have just read it in chat an hour ago.
[178:27.18]Isn't there no reason to play this if I'm gonna do it like that?
[178:32.80]I could just read you the Wikipedia article of each episode if you'd like.
[178:38.62]Would that make you happy?
[178:42.34]He's dead.
[178:43.12]I'm disappointed Flint fell for such an old trick.
[178:47.68]Okay, so we've got the brain.
[178:50.30]Let's put the brain in the body.
[178:51.80]Put the body in the chair.
[179:07.58]Come here, you.
[179:15.15]It is at times like these when a monster is driven to consider his place in history.
[179:22.83]Are we not all but misshapen combinations of flesh and feelings, bodies and souls?
[179:32.04]Yeah, okay, we get it.
[179:33.90]It's like I get to the movie theater to watch the movie that I haven't seen.
[179:37.33]And there's somebody standing in front of the theater doors.
[179:40.21]Hey, don't go in yet.
[179:41.93]Well, why not?
[179:43.11]Oh, because I'm going to tell you the whole movie right now.
[179:45.59]Don't even go in and watch it.
[179:47.87]I... No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[179:49.27]I want to see the movie.
[179:50.55]So you see what happens.
[179:51.59]No, no, actually, that's even better.
[179:53.71]That's like an hour before we get to the theater.
[179:55.07]Somebody calls me.
[179:59.15]Hey, heard you were going to see this movie in an hour.
[180:02.46]Yeah, yeah, I am.
[180:03.92]Let me, hey, let me just tell you everything.
[180:05.84]Don't go, you know, don't even go.
[180:11.00]Just hang up.
[180:12.44]Oh shit, please!
[180:13.29]I think he's ready.
[180:17.37]Heart of gold.
[180:21.97]Brain of power.
[180:23.63]Hand of the dead.
[180:25.47]Let's go.
[180:25.77]Alright.
[180:26.27]We've got...
[180:41.05]Your new boyfriend ready to go.
[180:42.83]Okay, bachelor number one.
[180:51.11]I'm looking for a man with a heart of gold.
[180:54.60]How would you prove you've got one?
[180:57.34]What's that?
[180:58.26]I'm terribly sorry.
[180:59.26]I was distracted.
[181:01.82]See, I used your restroom earlier.
[181:04.75]And I'm worried I might not have remembered to leave the seat down.
[181:08.75]Could you repeat the question?
[181:10.33]Hmm.
[181:11.85]What?
[181:12.25]I think I've heard enough.
[181:13.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[181:14.19]He has a heart of gold.
[181:16.80]Does it?
[181:17.26]He has a heart of gold in him right now.
[181:18.86]What?
[181:21.34]He has a heart of gold.
[181:30.94]She liked it.
[181:31.50]Well, she's like, I heard enough.
[181:35.80]Well, alright.
[181:37.68]Bachelor number one.
[181:39.74]I'm still looking for a man who's good with his hands.
[181:44.26]How good are you with yours?
[181:48.71]What are you doing?
[181:49.65]It's the only way I know how to express my feelings, ma'am.
[182:03.56]And I killed the little turkey over there.
[182:05.66]Does that please you?
[182:12.33]Okay, bachelor number one.
[182:14.59]My last boyfriend always knew the right thing to say.
[182:18.57]What sweet things would you say to me during a romantic moment?
[182:23.07]Well, it is altogether fitting and proper that I answer your question.
[182:29.09]But in a larger sense, our love would be so pure, so harmonious, so rapturous, that my mere words could do little to add or detract.
[182:43.02]Miss Pandemic?
[182:44.88]Marry me?
[182:46.32]Oh, I mean, yes, Bachelor One.
[182:48.82]That's perfectly adequate.
[182:52.72]Well, I think the choice is clear.
[182:55.16]Bachelor Number One.
[182:57.76]Now give me that soul replacer.
[182:59.40]Would you like to go steady?
[183:01.06]At last I feel complete.
[183:06.36]Preposterous.
[183:08.12]Please, no cameras.
[183:09.54]I need a moment.
[183:10.79]After years of searching, I finally found the perfect man.
[183:16.97]What?
[183:18.83]Oh, of course, you're right, Max.
[183:21.71]This has all been a lie.
[183:25.56]In my heart, I've always known who my true soulmate is.
[183:29.00]I just never wanted to admit it.
[183:31.46]What?
[183:32.20]I've been so stubborn and foolish.
[183:35.32]I only hope he'll take me back.
[183:39.24]Thanks a lot, jerks.
[183:43.25]I suppose a weekend in Cabo San Lucas is out of the question as well.
[183:46.83]Alright, well that's how that plays out.
[183:58.72]Give it the soul.
[184:00.20]Soul matter.
[184:03.54]Let's go get the soul.
[184:04.72]The two soul.
[184:05.84]Okay.
[184:09.00]I think we're going to suck him in there.
[184:12.82]Anything else in here that I can take?
[184:15.76]Maybe.
[184:16.22]Maybe.
[184:16.74]Maybe.
[184:17.57]Maybe.
[184:17.97]Who knows?
[184:19.23]One of all the gifts.
[184:20.01]Oh, free stuff?
[184:20.63]A free office full of stuff?
[184:31.84]Motion balls?
[184:33.20]Nah.
[184:33.66]Let's go.
[184:43.19]So we have the soul thing.
[184:44.27]I feel like it's going to be a little bit more elaborate than just point at the soul.
[184:50.21]We'll find out.
[185:00.99]This is episode 3.
[185:03.49]Episode 4 is coming up next.
[185:10.49]Alright.
[185:12.05]It's time for the climax.
[185:13.78]Are soul machines allowed in here?
[185:17.22]Thank you!
[185:37.08]Alright, so let's just go in there and see what they say about this.
[185:43.48]There must be a button or a switch.
[185:48.32]Is it this easy?
[185:48.76]What gives?
[185:55.84]I guess it is just this easy, huh?
[185:57.26]Alright.
[185:58.72]That's it.
[185:59.54]Did it.
[185:59.78]Okay.
[186:00.56]Oh.
[186:01.04]Okay.
[186:17.32]Ugh, Sam and Max.
[186:18.94]You keep returning when you know you cannot defeat me.
[186:22.46]That's Max and Sam.
[186:24.23]Steak.
[186:24.99]No matter.
[186:25.57]I will take your souls once again, but this time your bodies will be obliterated.
[186:34.47]Feels so weird.
[186:35.17]The audio is coming out the wrong way.
[186:37.13]Alright, stake.
[186:37.85]Stake him right in the heart.
[186:40.35]Alright, see you later.
[186:41.13]Murder him.
[187:04.47]Right in the heart.
[187:05.21]Do it.
[187:09.95]No!
[187:10.29]Oh, please.
[187:13.19]Too slow.
[187:16.75]I need another one.
[187:17.67]Wait, I need a drink.
[187:18.66]Give him alcohol.
[187:21.24]I bet those candy-ass vampire hunters just didn't know how to do it right.
[187:32.94]Did he catch the bullet?
[187:35.36]Yeah, drink.
[187:37.39]Here, take that.
[187:40.93]Should we go put alcohol on TV and make him drink it?
[187:51.79]Should we just make it, like, alcohol?
[187:54.77]What do you got in here?
[187:55.72]Go make it.
[187:58.60]Wait, let's do a TV commercial, quick.
[188:04.03]What is that?
[188:07.79]Does the gun ever work?
[188:09.49]I don't think it does.
[188:16.63]Um... Wait, you!
[188:20.48]Help us!
[188:26.12]Help us!
[188:26.80]No, he's not gonna help us, is he?
[188:33.24]I mean, can we electrocute?
[188:45.33]I can't condone drink.
[188:46.71]What are you supposed to do with that?
[188:47.71]Alright, what?
[188:48.09]Anything else in here?
[188:48.69]Alright.
[188:50.47]Cage?
[188:51.55]Should I just die?
[189:03.74]What happens if I just die?
[189:04.42]I just- I don't know, I didn't know if I could- What about some of these things?
[189:30.91]I can't, like, do anything with the monster body parts?
[189:33.30]I can't even click them.
[189:34.02]What else do I have here?
[189:34.68]I've got the typewriter.
[189:35.42]Can we leave the room?
[190:02.95]Should I put, like... I'm pretty sure this is useless.
[190:14.34]Should I wait till he's, like... Come on.
[190:21.00]Ah, this probably is not gonna work.
[190:28.64]No, just does the cutscene.
[190:32.30]So we gotta slow him down, or we have to be faster than him.
[190:36.75]But I feel like there's something that has to be done first.
[190:39.05]We have to crush him in that thing.
[190:43.51]We have to crush him in here somehow.
[190:45.07]I just don't know how.
[190:48.95]Jesse James is fast hand.
[190:50.33]Yeah, I can't take it from him.
[190:55.87]I can't touch any of this stuff.
[190:57.31]I barely got a handle on Max's body, much less the monster's.
[191:05.05]Maybe I should drink the holy water.
[191:09.91]Here.
[191:10.37]What about this?
[191:11.89]Nope.
[191:13.19]I don't think anybody can drink this.
[191:19.89]I can't condone drinking.
[191:20.87]Especially this stuff.
[191:24.10]Yeah, nobody can drink this.
[191:25.00]The monster can't drink it.
[191:25.94]Max, Sam can't drink it.
[191:26.86]Nobody wants to drink it.
[191:27.62]What about the coffin behind you?
[191:28.72]Can I do something with the coffin?
[191:31.22]I wish he'd just go back to bed.
[191:35.94]I don't think the... the monster won't, like, follow me either.
[191:38.46]Wait, can we actually do this?
[191:46.34]What is he... Why'd you do that?
[191:50.67]So let's... let's die again.
[191:51.93]Uh... Okay.
[191:52.15]Let's die for a third time.
[192:07.51]We both just go in?
[192:08.61]Okay, so we're... Now we shoot him.
[192:09.95]I don't have any... I don't have a gun.
[192:11.21]Give me a big one.
[192:40.20]Alright, it's time to stab.
[192:42.60]But wouldn't this guy be slower?
[192:43.84]Frankenstein is really slow.
[192:46.76]Oh, that hurts.
[193:01.45]What?
[193:01.59]No!
[193:06.50]Crush.
[193:06.66]They should have, like, blood just fucking spray out of the center of that thing.
[193:12.04]Aww.
[193:12.28]Sad.
[193:40.77]Hey, Sammy, you're back.
[193:42.11]What about Max?
[193:42.61]He's in time, too.
[193:43.63]What's up, Flint?
[193:44.57]You know I've been tailing that Bosco mug, right?
[193:47.19]Well, the trail's gone colder than a Dear John letter written on no-tell motel stationery.
[193:52.18]Bosco's just loud and easily startled.
[193:54.46]We'll help you dig him up.
[193:55.82]That's the rub, see?
[193:58.00]Bosco's vanished off the face of the Earth.
[194:02.31]Cliffhanger.
[194:06.51]What will it be?
[194:07.51]We'll have to find out in a minute or two.
[194:12.69]That was Night of the Raving Dead by Sam and Max.
[194:19.26]Well, actually by Dan Connors and Kevin Bruner, but, you know, and all these other people that worked on it.
[194:26.95]Next episode.
[194:30.35]That was alright.
[194:32.23]I don't know if I'd put that one in my top three.
[194:42.32]It was okay.
[194:43.04]It was good.
[194:45.62]I'll put it somewhere in the middle.
[194:51.03]It's not top three.
[194:52.23]How dare you!
[194:55.73]The next one is really good.
[194:57.33]But that's good.
[194:57.87]Looking forward to it.
[195:12.91]Why is it so silent?
[195:15.15]I'm just noticing this now.
[195:17.94]It's very quiet.
[195:20.70]To a point where I'm... It's kind of freaking me out.
[195:30.17]We're going to have to do it all again.
[195:31.61]We'll just do the whole thing again.
[195:33.39]I'll just restart it.
[195:40.28]Alright, episode four.
[195:41.32]Let's change this to be episode four.
[195:44.58]204 is, what is 204?
[195:47.94]Chariots of the Dogs is this episode, 204.
[195:57.43]Can we do a pee break?
[195:58.41]Yeah, we'll do a little break here.
[196:01.29]Thanks for watching.
[196:01.81]We'll see you in the next episode in less than a few minutes.
[196:11.21]Did I hear correctly that they're deleting all these forever?
[196:16.17]I think all the Telltale games are actually getting wiped out completely.
[196:20.55]Yeah.
[196:23.87]You can't buy these anymore, I don't think.
[196:27.53]So if you like these games, and you don't own physical copies of them...
[196:36.09]I would go get them.
[196:37.13]I would download them.
[196:38.39]And just have them.
[196:39.44]Because... I don't know what's going to happen to them.
[196:48.97]I think you can get them in some random places, but it's a little bit of a pain in the ass, right?
[196:57.30]You'll still be able to download after they're pulled.
[196:59.20]You just can't buy them.
[197:00.75]Okay.
[197:01.35]But still, though, just in case if you wanted them on Steam, they are, I believe, all of them are disappearing.
[197:07.15]Alright, let's take a quick little pee break.
[197:10.52]We'll start episode four when I get back, and we'll do episode four.
[197:15.72]I will be right back.
[197:16.86]See you in just a minute.
[200:16.28]Hey, look at that.
[200:16.70]That was pretty quick, wasn't it?
[200:17.60]That was a nice little speed piss.
[200:26.87]Not really.
[200:30.57]I thought that was fast.
[200:31.87]I thought that was really fast.
[200:37.38]But look, the game's already here!
[200:39.43]That was pretty fast.
[200:40.47]It usually takes me like five, 10 minutes to set this up.
[200:42.65]I'm ready to go.
[200:43.71]Bingo.
[200:44.49]Done.
[200:44.99]Here we are.
[200:45.91]Ready to play.
[200:52.12]You ready?
[200:53.62]Okay.
[200:55.02]You back?
[200:57.42]Episode four.
[201:00.94]One, two, three.
[201:18.91]breaking into Bosco's.
[201:24.31]Okay, we're in boys!
[201:27.19]Bosco!
[201:28.41]Free anti-mind control helmets for the first 50 lunatics to come out of hiding!
[201:34.30]I've been telling you, little pals.
[201:36.08]He's just plain vanished.
[201:37.68]Where'd he go?
[201:38.52]We'd better look around the joint for clues.
[201:40.34]Find Bosco.
[201:41.12]Good plan, Sammo.
[201:42.02]Guess that's why they call you guys in for the brainy stuff.
[201:44.99]And leave the senseless violence to the likes of me.
[201:47.77]I deeply resent that comment, Mr. Paper.
[201:50.61]Yeah, Flint.
[201:51.51]We're gonna have to join together and use every detective skill we know to find Bosco.
[201:57.41]The white line, I know.
[201:59.27]Because when you open these games, you don't get to go to the menu.
[202:01.37]It kind of just starts.
[202:06.01]So once I get to the menu, I can change it.
[202:09.73]Like right now.
[202:16.67]It should allow us to do this.
[202:29.56]There it goes.
[202:31.54]How's that look?
[202:34.00]That looks alright to me.
[202:38.18]Make it bigger.
[202:40.60]Just make a huge white line.
[202:50.41]What happened to my... Did I lose... What happened to my...
[202:56.52]Hold on, where the fuck is it?
[203:01.02]Black screen!
[203:01.74]No, it's not.
[203:02.58]Um, why'd that disappear?
[203:07.06]Am I gonna play Season 3 on stream?
[203:10.51]Yeah, I mean, let's get to the end of Season 2 and see.
[203:14.49]I would assume, because we're doing just 1, 2, I would probably just do 3.
[203:20.11]There are a few things that are way ahead of Season 3, though.
[203:22.86]There's a couple of games that I really want to play for a while.
[203:25.74]So... Season 3 won't be, like, this weekend or something.
[203:31.01]It would be, like, a week or two from now.
[203:35.61]Okay, there we go.
[203:37.93]That was odd.
[203:38.47]Let's do it in a year.
[203:45.01]Alright, so we need to look around, see what we can find.
[203:48.36]Evidence of Bosco's disappearance.
[203:53.84]Dude's just gone.
[203:55.32]Trash.
[203:57.46]Nothing in the trash.
[203:58.16]What about, uh... We never go behind the counter?
[204:00.46]Might and Magic?
[204:01.06]Yeah, we're doing Might and Magic tomorrow.
[204:08.44]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is going to be tomorrow.
[204:11.61]And if we are enjoying it and it's still fun, I'll probably do it the next day as well.
[204:16.43]There's a landmine in the corner?
[204:28.75]okay keypad this keypad must control the laser grid blocking bosco's bathroom oh use it to spell boobies I love that bosco lasers and pushing random buttons are three things that don't go well together little buddy it says the code is in my head we better find it soon then it must be getting lonely the code is in my head
[204:56.80]Is this a shotgun?
[204:57.79]No, just two pipes.
[204:58.67]Can I pick up the tapes or anything?
[205:00.55]No.
[205:02.23]Can we finally have a weenie?
[205:03.39]No, different weenie.
[205:04.23]Alright, well, there's a keypad.
[205:07.61]We need a code.
[205:09.35]Nothing else here.
[205:09.99]Yeah.
[205:10.67]Alright, let's get out of here.
[205:22.06]As informative as Max Impeachment Weekly is, I doubt it'll tell us where Bosco is.
[205:28.07]Let's check over here.
[205:30.63]Photocopy.
[205:31.55]No clues here.
[205:34.93]Sure, Bosco.
[205:36.07]Everybody else is watching you.
[205:40.18]Can we look through his periscope?
[205:41.44]We already checked the roof.
[205:43.02]Just a Pigeon AA meeting.
[205:44.50]Nothing worth mentioning.
[205:47.80]Are we allowed to go in here?
[205:49.56]We can't get in until we get past this laser grid.
[205:51.93]Oh, we're actually going to get to see in here.
[205:54.33]First, you have to forgive the laser grid.
[206:00.99]Freezer, freezer.
[206:02.33]Is he in the freezer?
[206:03.09]What time is the stream gonna be for Heroes of Might Magic?
[206:08.70]The regular time between 3 and 4 p.m.
[206:12.70]Pacific.
[206:14.42]Did I miss something over here?
[206:20.80]There's a head.
[206:22.62]Well, it's in the head.
[206:27.81]How do I get it in this head?
[206:32.76]Moai head.
[206:37.90]Can I, like, break it?
[206:39.34]Can I, like, heat it up or something?
[206:51.37]Can I freeze it?
[207:04.28]Can I read it?
[207:05.68]Nobody can read it?
[207:08.38]Microwave?
[207:09.80]X-ray?
[207:10.04]Hey, X-ray.
[207:12.46]Prognosis, Sam?
[207:13.30]It's too dark to read it.
[207:34.32]Alright, so, x-ray.
[207:38.27]Can I put this under, on something?
[207:42.93]There's photos here.
[207:47.38]So, can I leave here?
[207:48.20]Is there a lamp or something?
[207:49.10]Is there like a heat lamp or something?
[207:50.60]Light?
[207:54.02]the x-ray is plenty big enough it's just too dark to make out light we need some light photo equipment no clues here light are you gonna have like a light in here no way nothing doing can we just read it out in the sun bosco didn't take any pictures of himself his camera no doubt thanks him
[208:21.72]It's not like you to give up on a case, Sammo.
[208:24.48]You're right, Flint.
[208:25.40]Don't know what came over me.
[208:28.06]Well, no, we cannot just go outside.
[208:29.62]We need a source of light.
[208:39.73]Well, you have an x-ray viewer up here, apparently.
[208:42.27]Looks like.
[208:43.63]Say it.
[208:44.64]Alright, so the password is... 5318008
[209:10.79]Yeah.
[209:12.12]It's... I'm not saying that they are.
[209:13.62]Let's check in the bathroom for more clues.
[209:25.48]Bathroom reveal.
[209:26.24]Let's see what it is.
[209:27.32]I'm actually pretty curious.
[209:28.10]It's been off limits for like two and a half whole seasons.
[209:32.06]Let's see if there's anything in the bathroom to tell us where Bosco's top secret bunker is.
[209:36.20]Or maybe the bathroom is his top secret bunker.
[209:39.44]This is exactly where I'd want to spend an apocalypse.
[209:41.70]Demagnetized shirts.
[209:42.76]I sense that something terrible happened here.
[209:45.26]Oh, you don't know the half of it.
[209:50.80]Bosco's been ordering nothing but baking soda and paper mache.
[209:53.94]You can do a lot with baking soda.
[209:54.80]You can clean, deodorize.
[209:56.96]It's good stuff.
[209:59.18]The Bosco Tech Drain Liberator 6000.
[210:02.93]I'm not going anywhere near that thing.
[210:04.75]Demonetized.
[210:05.41]Not after seeing what it did to that sludgy delivery guy.
[210:08.59]The sound alone still haunts my nightmares.
[210:14.31]If you explore it, they will come.
[210:18.17]If you explode it, they will come.
[210:20.75]And if it's brown, flush it down.
[210:27.53]Hot toilet wine.
[210:29.07]Everything Bosco would need to survive for months.
[210:33.05]Oh, nice.
[210:33.45]Alright.
[210:34.31]Urinal.
[210:34.61]I agree.
[210:34.81]I agree.
[210:35.03]We actually both agree on that.
[210:59.42]Alright, so we get disguise kit.
[211:00.54]Shurmur's water filter.
[211:01.60]I use a fire hydrant.
[211:02.42]No.
[211:02.56]So we got some baking soda, we...
[211:28.65]Well, this is a volcano.
[211:29.55]Okay.
[211:29.75]Paper.
[211:29.95]Yeah, who's used this bathroom?
[211:30.67]Alright, well, I mean, the scientist in me wants to do this.
[211:33.03]Alright, now we just need, um, we need vinegar.
[212:00.53]Do you have any vinegar in here?
[212:22.11]Baking soda plus vinegar equals eruption.
[212:24.14]Yeah, well, where do I get it?
[212:25.30]Baking soda plus vinegar equals eruption.
[212:28.50]Sounds hot, but they didn't leave a phone number.
[212:32.11]Can I use, like, the toilet wine?
[212:33.61]No.
[212:35.47]I would clean up in here, but I don't want to disturb any evidence.
[212:41.08]Well, there it is.
[212:42.08]That was a pretty good leg.
[212:43.13]Let's see.
[212:43.41]Make an explosion.
[212:44.15]Make it meet the ceiling.
[212:45.69]Put your eye into it.
[213:04.64]Uh... Okay.
[213:04.88]So... Okay.
[213:05.12]Can I just dump it?
[213:05.90]Hmm.
[213:05.98]Can I dump it in the other one?
[213:07.08]Okay.
[213:32.67]Well, we gotta get the barrel open.
[213:34.40]Aha!
[213:34.54]Dump it in there.
[213:37.30]The gun actually worked!
[213:59.67]The gun does work.
[214:00.85]Sometimes.
[214:01.53]And the school board said our cases had no educational merit.
[214:04.82]Do it again!
[214:05.54]Do it again!
[214:08.60]What's that noise?
[214:12.68]Aliens.
[214:18.86]Alien episode?
[214:19.86]They've come for us, Max.
[214:21.34]It's T-H-E-M.
[214:23.44]Good!
[214:24.06]About time we found out who's responsible for this travesty.
[214:30.55]Whoever was upstairs is straight up dead.
[214:37.37]Yeah.
[214:41.63]I'm gonna get it, here we go.
[214:45.55]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[214:47.31]You ready?
[214:50.41]Don't miss once.
[214:54.96]Three times.
[214:56.54]Changed the ending.
[215:06.08]That's got flashbacks of the Pepper game.
[215:16.42]The one that was unwinnable.
[215:17.64]What the fuck?
[215:21.46]Look, I can explain.
[215:23.52]Did you get a haircut, Bosco?
[215:25.30]There's something different.
[215:26.84]Finally see a doctor about that, uh, personal problem?
[215:30.66]You guys done?
[215:32.14]Yeah, that's all we got.
[215:33.64]Good.
[215:34.56]Now shut up and help me!
[215:36.73]What seems to be the problem, Bessie?
[215:38.75]That, that elevator over there!
[215:41.01]It's horrible!
[215:42.55]I went inside looking for T-H-E-M, but when I got out, I saw my mother!
[215:48.41]Yeah, I want to fix this.
[215:50.85]This is unsettling.
[215:51.57]Imagine if he stood up on the hind legs and was mooing and walking really fast.
[215:57.46]Okay.
[216:15.45]Uh, what are you doing here?
[216:16.45]Oh, I hate this.
[216:16.89]I don't like this.
[216:17.59]It's, like, freaking me out.
[216:44.15]Something to do with, like, just that perfectly, like, normal human face and then, like, this.
[216:53.33]Where's this THEM detector device you were talking about?
[216:56.75]I don't know.
[216:57.63]I must have lost it in that elevator after I got turned into this, this, this, this thing.
[217:01.89]The back neck.
[217:02.97]Yeah, the back neck is fucked.
[217:07.25]Right here.
[217:08.38]It's...
[217:11.98]What is this place, Bosco?
[217:13.76]You guys still don't get it?
[217:15.65]This is it.
[217:16.85]The center of the entire operation of T.H.E.M.
[217:20.79]Kind of sparse for the headquarters of a sinister cabal bent on world domination.
[217:25.39]You don't need much room when you can go anywhere you want through time and space.
[217:31.91]No, that's not gamer neck.
[217:33.05]That's like rooster.
[217:34.19]That's like a chicken neck.
[217:36.21]That's like bird neck.
[217:41.00]What's with all the volcanoes back in your store?
[217:43.36]Guys, guys, try to keep up.
[217:45.64]Haven't you figured anything out yet?
[217:48.32]The volcano is what summons the spaceship, fools.
[217:52.41]Nerd deck is bird deck.
[217:53.81]Or are we being scolded by the guy who's half cow?
[218:04.55]Well, where are they?
[218:05.25]This place seems pretty empty.
[218:06.97]Where are T-H-E-Y hanging out?
[218:09.15]I don't know, but you can bet they're around here somewhere, just waiting to probe us and turn us all into freakish animal-human hybrids.
[218:18.56]Bosco, Sam is standing right here.
[218:21.52]OK, so where is it again?
[218:24.58]Where is this THEM detector device you were talking about?
[218:27.58]I don't know.
[218:28.46]I must have lost it in that elevator after I got turned into this, this, this, this thing.
[218:33.72]Alright, let's go to the elevator.
[218:35.74]Take a look around first.
[218:36.58]I don't know.
[218:37.02]Probably.
[218:37.40]Fair enough.
[218:37.94]I don't want to talk over the audience.
[218:39.90]Okay, elevator.
[218:40.20]Let's just say, hold on.
[218:41.02]There's a captain's chair.
[219:05.88]Hey, Max, what do you think this thing is?
[219:08.02]Calibrating.
[219:09.64]Complete.
[219:10.82]I now have mastered your primitive but no less valid language.
[219:14.91]Please choose from the following topics of conversation.
[219:19.51]System identification, owner, obvious query, elevator usage.
[219:23.21]Well, identification.
[219:25.85]I am this craft's artificial intelligence.
[219:29.61]I supervise the operations of this craft and the activities of its crew.
[219:33.53]Okay.
[219:35.71]Who owns here?
[219:36.21]Where's the crew?
[219:37.15]They are currently occupied with the craft's primary mission.
[219:40.86]They will arrive shortly to detain you for your own safety.
[219:44.06]Okay, time limit.
[219:46.08]What happened to Bosco?
[219:47.40]The intruder made unsanctioned use of the time shuttle.
[219:52.40]How do we use that elevator?
[219:53.98]Simply choose a destination.
[219:56.18]Additional destinations can be opened using convenient pre-printed time cards.
[220:03.81]Okay.
[220:04.39]How do we use that elevator?
[220:05.93]Simply choose a destination.
[220:08.11]Additional destinations can be opened using convenient pre-printed time cards.
[220:15.12]There's more.
[220:16.68]System settings.
[220:18.22]What are my options?
[220:19.34]My personality can be configured to respond in the style most appropriate to the user.
[220:24.90]Please choose from the following options.
[220:28.68]Politically correct, suggestive, abusive, passive, aggressive.
[220:32.52]Passive aggressive.
[220:33.98]Selection acknowledged.
[220:35.75]I'll just alter my entire personality matrix to make you more comfortable.
[220:44.27]Alright.
[220:45.09]Print a time card, please.
[220:46.75]I cannot print a time card until the captain chooses a destination.
[220:51.85]Well, then can we terminate?
[220:53.13]So long.
[220:53.83]Fine.
[220:54.69]Leave.
[220:55.61]It's not like I was still talking.
[221:02.08]That was pretty creepy.
[221:02.86]Alright, what do we got here?
[221:04.34]Elevator.
[221:06.60]Bosco's time card.
[221:16.93]Does this just take us back down to Bosco's?
[221:20.83]Okay.
[221:23.34]We have to find other time cards.
[221:25.72]Bosco's again?
[221:26.78]How did we end up back here?
[221:29.20]Judging from the lack of safety railings and ready availability of guns and ammo, I'd say we've gone back in time.
[221:35.60]Seems to be some time in the early... Sweet mother of mole sauce!
[221:39.71]You fools gonna buy something, or do you want to make a baby?
[221:42.95]Well now... Uh-oh.
[221:46.55]It's Mama Bosco.
[221:50.52]carbon dater remember that old carbon dater we got from sybil last year yeah we gave it to bosco so he could keep scanning his weenies looks like he's made some modifications to it alright guns baby needs baby making machine looks like a weird bread making machine
[222:12.28]Don't be silly.
[222:13.38]That's my baby maker.
[222:15.40]You take a spit sample from the mother and one from the father, mix them together in that machine, and then out comes a happy little bundle of perfection.
[222:24.74]Finally, somebody explains how that works.
[222:27.92]That's not the generally agreed upon method, Max.
[222:30.80]So are we going to spit in this?
[222:32.76]This sample has been completely contaminated by milk.
[222:35.63]It'll have to be replaced.
[222:37.91]This sample has been completely contaminated by milk.
[222:40.67]It'll have to be replaced.
[222:43.28]Hmm, this sample says Mama Bosco.
[222:46.02]Don't touch that.
[222:47.28]I made that sample when my spit was most fertile.
[222:51.58]We have to go again.
[222:52.64]Hmm, what's this?
[222:54.04]It's my chemical sampler.
[222:56.08]Give somebody to spit on it, and it gives you a sample test tube for the baby maker.
[223:01.04]Mind if we borrow it?
[223:02.33]Go ahead.
[223:02.89]Can we spit in this?
[223:03.45]I already got all I need.
[223:05.01]Alright, Max, spit in this.
[223:09.45]I think I'm better off not knowing what Max is made of.
[223:11.87]Oh, fine.
[223:14.80]What a waste.
[223:16.53]What a senseless waste.
[223:19.17]No, that's comedy.
[223:21.11]That's true.
[223:22.91]Timeless comedy.
[223:25.11]Crying over spilt milk.
[223:28.61]Baby food and bum wipes.
[223:30.65]If you use less of one, you wouldn't need as many of the other.
[223:33.07]I thought you said you weren't going to be playing porn games.
[223:37.51]They're... They're...
[223:44.06]Guns, garbage cans.
[223:45.00]The one constant across all human cultures of all times is a massive amount of waste.
[223:49.96]Alright, I want to have a conversation with Mama Bosco.
[223:54.62]You must be Mrs. Bosco.
[223:56.31]That's Ms.
[223:57.57]Bosco.
[223:58.53]I don't want any part of your oppressive patriarchy.
[224:02.25]The police?
[224:02.69]What do you need the police for?
[224:06.42]Who?
[224:15.90]Did you say make a baby?
[224:17.40]What was that you said about making a baby?
[224:19.60]I'm made uncomfortable by this line of questioning, Sam.
[224:22.98]That's just because you're scared of a world where career-minded women don't need to be tied to a man to have a family.
[224:28.61]This ain't the past anymore.
[224:30.27]It's the 1960s.
[224:32.83]They can talk about putting a person on the moon, and I can invent a baby-making machine.
[224:38.76]Okay, who do you want to catch?
[224:40.06]Which fool did you want us to catch exactly?
[224:42.44]That man who just came in here yelling about conspiracies and busting up the place.
[224:48.44]Bosco always did know how to make a memorable first impression.
[224:55.07]Can you tell us more about the man who trashed your shop?
[224:57.68]He took one look at me and screamed.
[225:00.06]That should narrow the list of suspects down to any man with eyes.
[225:05.83]Then he stumbled back and ran right into my baby maker.
[225:09.33]Ouch.
[225:17.37]What the fuck?
[225:19.59]Where...
[225:21.55]We're here to help your son.
[225:23.01]I don't have a son.
[225:25.21]You think it's not enough I'm a businesswoman and inventor?
[225:27.79]A woman's only useful if she's got a son.
[225:31.25]It's not that.
[225:32.46]We're friends with him.
[225:33.76]Well, acquaintances.
[225:35.62]We know him.
[225:36.66]We've spoken to him more than once.
[225:40.00]Doesn't matter.
[225:41.26]I'm not defined by my children.
[225:43.96]But when I do have one, she's gonna be the most perfect little angel.
[225:50.33]We'll watch out for store records.
[225:51.93]We can't take the case, but we'll keep an eye out for your vandal, Miss Bosco.
[225:55.59]I swear if I ever find him, I'm gonna make sure he gets no pleasure in this life.
[226:01.52]Aw, I haven't heard a tale of motherly love like that since the Manchurian Candidate.
[226:09.06]So how does that baby maker work?
[226:11.96]You just take a DNA sample from the mother and the other person and combine them in that machine.
[226:17.41]Let it bake a couple hours and you've got a beautiful baby girl.
[226:21.51]Are we going to... I've already got my own samples in there.
[226:25.97]I'm going to test it out tonight after closing.
[226:28.01]Are we going to go get her son's DNA and put it in there?
[226:34.94]Saliva, fools!
[226:36.72]Well, naturally.
[226:39.32]Is that what is happening?
[226:46.63]What do you mean no?
[226:47.11]What are you talking about?
[226:50.87]What?
[226:52.51]It was the milk.
[226:53.25]It said there was a milk container.
[226:54.77]The milk in there.
[226:55.54]And it was fucked up by milk.
[226:56.52]And then I... Bosco?
[226:59.54]Infinite loop.
[227:06.87]Don't know I don't know I thought I for some reason I just I thought I had to go like make like another Bosco You are
[227:30.78]Where'd you get the father sample?
[227:32.46]Oh, him.
[227:33.32]Well, I was just in Washington, D.C.
[227:35.22]for a special occasion.
[227:36.82]And when I was touring the White House, I met a nice man in a dark suit.
[227:40.38]He was polite and didn't say much.
[227:42.50]Seemed like his spit was as good as anybody else's.
[227:45.07]So I picked him.
[227:47.59]Who?
[227:48.91]Okay.
[227:50.27]See you later, Ms.
[227:50.97]Bosco.
[227:51.83]We're going to pick up some swinging 60s chicks and start a groovy hullabaloo.
[227:56.57]Men.
[227:57.83]Cut it out, Max.
[227:58.95]You don't even like girls.
[228:05.11]I have never been as turned on as I am right now.
[228:16.31]What?
[228:17.05]You just never found the right woman and I never found the right man.
[228:21.25]Forget the baby maker.
[228:23.21]Catastrophic temporal anomaly detected.
[228:26.30]Run away with me, Max.
[228:27.78]My white stallion.
[228:29.44]Curse my irresistible animal magnetism.
[228:35.64]You should reconsider.
[228:37.07]My office is strict.
[228:38.23]It's not you, it's me.
[228:39.61]I'm not prepared.
[228:47.35]You should reconsider.
[228:49.24]I don't know.
[228:50.58]I can already see us.
[228:53.52]Living next door to that nice detective.
[228:56.54]Well, it would be nice having someone to do my laundry.
[228:59.96]You don't even wear clothes.
[229:01.74]And yet, I always end up with so many bloodstained shirts.
[229:06.40]Tis a mystery.
[229:09.44]What about the children?
[229:10.82]I don't know.
[229:11.52]What about that?
[229:12.74]I won't need kids once I have the love of my Max.
[229:16.09]He'll be my new little pet project.
[229:26.35]I'm not prepared to commit.
[229:27.94]I'm a bad seed.
[229:29.26]I can't be faithful to just one woman.
[229:31.66]Oh, I'm enough for at least a dozen women.
[229:34.26]You dog, you.
[229:35.06]Let's go.
[229:37.80]Lady, you just don't get it.
[229:40.00]I'm just not into you.
[229:42.56]Eject.
[229:43.58]Eject.
[229:44.10]Alright.
[229:44.70]We're going to have somebody blow a snot rocket into this thing and put it in here.
[229:56.70]Wait, what's in here?
[229:58.05]Wee!
[230:10.25]Wee!
[230:10.69]We're better to crunch numbers than in the John.
[230:12.57]I'm sorry, everyone's fucking really upset about that one.
[230:16.01]My paws are spotless.
[230:18.45]Oh, the germs look so young.
[230:19.62]Count- I can't do anything behind this?
[230:22.50]We're better to crunch numbers than in the John.
[230:26.91]No timeout needed.
[230:29.60]Wine?
[230:29.84]Hmm.
[230:31.44]A nice aged bottle of Nippy Valley brand vinegar.
[230:34.14]Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[230:46.23]Oh, we did it!
[230:47.77]We're the ones that opened up the bottle to make sure that we could use the wine bottle to pour into the container of the baking soda to blow the hole in the ceiling for us to go up and then go in back in time and be here.
[231:03.58]It's a perfect loop.
[231:14.25]Can I leave?
[231:16.15]Alright, well we need a... I have the carbon dater.
[231:20.17]I need a sample.
[231:25.02]I have the carbon dater.
[231:26.16]I have the cork.
[231:30.04]Let's just see if I can do anything back here.
[231:32.22]What do you think you're doing?
[231:34.06]You know, the usual.
[231:35.12]Traveling through time and stuff.
[231:37.28]Override.
[231:38.28]You've caused a catastrophic temporal anomaly.
[231:41.20]You're going back to the ship so you can think about what you've done.
[231:45.89]What are you talking about?
[231:47.59]I opened up the cork!
[231:48.71]I opened the wine up!
[231:57.48]Oh wait, he's starting not to exist.
[232:04.14]What the hell did you guys do?
[232:06.34]Max, when you made Mama Bosco decide not to have a baby, that meant Bosco was never born.
[232:12.42]But if Bosco was never born, then we never would have gone back to meet Mama Bosco in the first place.
[232:19.26]Neat!
[232:20.10]Are you fools just gonna stand there explaining everything, or are you gonna fix me?
[232:24.51]Sheesh!
[232:25.99]Give a guy a cool cow body, and all of a sudden he's the owner of the time stream.
[232:31.16]That was gonna be really cool.
[232:32.36]When, like, George Washington, like, time streams to everybody.
[232:34.70]We can actually see stuff from the past.
[232:36.18]Adjust his webcam and get in there.
[232:41.22]Alright, so... Sampler.
[232:45.52]Am I gonna do the thing?
[232:48.93]I can't think of any part of Bosco that I'd want to carry around with me.
[232:52.91]That's not how time travel works?
[232:57.15]Yeah, I mean, there's...
[232:58.53]Because time traveling, you go back and kill your grandfather, and that means that you never existed yourself.
[233:07.99]So you couldn't go back.
[233:10.47]You wouldn't exist.
[233:12.29]It'd take me four days to fix.
[233:14.14]You have 30 seconds.
[233:32.24]I can't even get over that.
[233:33.80]Louis Armstrong voice?
[233:36.60]What?
[233:44.05]What the fuck?
[233:44.95]Alright, so... Stop doing that!
[233:49.15]You're interrupting me!
[233:50.01]Can I just go in here?
[233:56.50]Ray Romano.
[233:58.46]Ray, Ray.
[233:58.78]No, it is more like Ray Romano.
[234:05.72]That, that's more like Ray Romano.
[234:08.17]What was I doing?
[234:09.77]I was going... Well, in it... Okay, no, I was doing it.
[234:14.79]I was doing Ray Romano, you're right.
[234:17.35]Alright, so we have to... Looks like some kind of weird alien radio.
[234:22.03]I need a cork.
[234:26.54]The carbon dater.
[234:27.44]Can I sit in the captain's chair?
[234:29.14]Scanning.
[234:29.56]Scanning.
[234:30.04]Scanning.
[234:30.36]Let's scan each other.
[234:36.36]Whoa!
[234:36.46]This thing prints time cards?
[235:01.74]What?
[235:02.28]Are you shitting me right now?
[235:03.56]Can I scan the computer?
[235:04.38]Nah.
[235:04.50]Alright, well, let's go to Stinkies.
[235:05.88]Stinkies.
[235:06.12]Uh... And... Freelance Police.
[235:07.18]One.
[235:07.34]There are one, two, three more to get.
[235:32.56]We're going to go to Stinky's.
[235:41.20]I gotta scan everybody and get more time cards.
[235:51.97]Grandpa.
[235:53.59]What do you two want?
[235:55.69]It's the one true Stinky.
[235:58.24]Are we glad to see you.
[235:59.96]Why?
[236:03.06]Still, it's a new person to talk to.
[236:04.83]Abraham Lincoln's voice.
[236:05.49]Look, Sam!
[236:06.33]It's us as impressionable preteens!
[236:09.05]Exceedingly well done!
[236:12.97]No, we can't go... We're gonna go talk to ourselves and it's gonna cause a problem.
[236:18.20]You have to avoid your past selves.

[238:18.02]Alright, what else do you like?

[240:02.11]I didn't want to ask that one again.
[240:04.47]Didn't want to ask that one.
[240:05.39]Make good choices, son.
[240:06.83]Didn't you guys say I could play with your guns?
[240:09.03]We like it.
[240:10.30]Remember this.
[240:11.46]It's a good life lesson.
[240:12.66]I didn't think I clicked, whatever.
[240:15.02]Screwdriver.
[240:16.10]Well, as long as you promise to bring it back, I hate to think what would happen if I had to stop working on computers.
[240:22.82]Yeah, sure thing, kid.
[240:25.02]Uh-oh.
[240:27.83]We've changed the timeline.
[240:29.51]Now I grow up to be Sam.
[240:31.23]Alright, what about Little Max?
[240:35.54]Hey, little guy.
[240:36.68]What are you scamps up to?
[240:38.18]I'm only playing Bluster Blaster, the newest and best video game ever made.
[240:43.64]Duh!
[240:44.18]Nice try!
[240:47.65]You guys are nerds.
[240:49.67]What?
[240:49.85]Wow, you really love that game.
[241:13.34]Games are dumb.
[241:14.26]People rule.
[241:15.64]Wouldn't it be healthier to get your validation from other people?
[241:18.48]People are dumb, and they just don't get me.
[241:21.30]You're the greatest!
[241:22.98]See?
[241:23.49]It's like the game knows what I'm thinking.
[241:28.37]Games will stunt your growth.
[241:30.55]Playing that game so much is unhealthy, little guy.
[241:33.49]You're awesome!
[241:35.67]Unhealthy to hear the truth?
[241:37.75]I don't think so.
[241:40.12]Alright.
[241:40.66]Hey, what's going on today?
[241:41.56]I vaguely remember something very important about this day.
[241:45.38]What was it?
[241:46.42]There was my party.
[241:47.52]Duh.
[241:47.92]Max's party.
[241:48.97]Don't forget that prom and after prom kissing retreat tonight, Max.
[241:52.03]Boring.
[241:53.71]Great job.
[241:54.73]You're getting better.
[241:58.70]That prom sounds like a fun and informative time for a young person.
[242:02.08]Why aren't you there?
[242:03.22]Couldn't you get a date?
[242:04.28]I can't even.
[242:04.80]Loser.
[242:05.72]You're the loser.
[242:06.64]Loser.
[242:07.20]No, you are.
[242:08.28]Jenny Tallarico asked me to go, but I turned her down.
[242:11.64]She just doesn't get me like bluster blaster.
[242:14.42]Bluster blaster.
[242:15.36]Great move.
[242:16.28]You almost dodged it.
[242:20.53]Wasn't Jenny Tallarico the girl who had a crush on you for years, Max?
[242:24.45]I don't know.
[242:25.07]I never noticed.
[242:25.77]They call her Jenny Tongarico because she'll kiss anybody and she uses her whole mouth.
[242:32.35]Grody.
[242:33.27]Grody.
[242:36.23]We're still here doing this.
[242:38.19]There's lots of neat stuff about girls.
[242:40.06]You'll realize once you take that first step to adulthood.
[242:43.52]Why bother?
[242:44.50]I've got everything I need right here.
[242:46.56]You're the best.
[242:49.41]Go outside.
[242:50.76]Go meet girls.
[242:52.02]Go outside and play.
[242:53.56]Why would I go outside when my best friend's in here?
[242:56.96]Gee, Max.
[242:58.14]Oh, yeah.
[242:58.62]Sam's here, too.
[242:59.76]You're radical.
[243:02.34]Alright.
[243:02.68]That's enough.
[243:03.14]Just say no, little buddy.
[243:04.80]Word up.
[243:07.52]Can I talk to Bluster Blaster?
[243:09.06]It's our old pal, Bluster Blaster.
[243:11.28]Wait your turn.
[243:17.03]No way.
[243:18.54]I was gonna break the screen.
[243:19.46]Okay.
[243:25.06]Memorable toast?
[243:27.72]I was trying to break the screen!
[243:34.63]I was trying to hit, like, the screen!
[243:36.73]I was just trying to break the screen!
[243:38.63]Everybody needs to relax!
[243:43.35]Hiya, Stinky.
[243:44.61]Are you the parents of those two parasites?
[243:48.08]Well, not exactly.
[243:49.94]Although we do still have a time machine, so I wouldn't completely rule out the possibility.
[243:54.78]That's gross, Max.
[243:55.92]I'm just trying to break the screen.
[243:57.26]Just trying to break the screen.
[243:58.32]I'm just trying to break the screen.
[243:59.99]Hey, we're from the future.
[244:03.63]We bring a warning from the future.
[244:06.11]In about 25 years, you're going to be...
[244:10.23]murdered murdered my swollen pancreas I once wrestled four rabid grizzlies while standing on the back of a rutting alligator while being pelted with karari tipped darts and fighting off a case of irritable bowel syndrome I'd like to meet the man who could murder old stinky hi I'm max
[244:33.05]Really?
[244:33.43]You're gonna die?
[244:34.65]We're detectives, and we've seen all the evidence.
[244:37.21]You're gonna get offed.
[244:38.58]When?
[244:39.34]How?
[244:39.86]And who's going to do it?
[244:42.22]Well, we don't know exactly.
[244:43.98]Detectives is really more of a catch-all term for guys with guns.
[244:51.07]Some woman claiming to be your granddaughter has taken over your restaurant.
[244:54.59]Granddaughter, my cleft palate.
[244:56.67]I never had any children.
[244:58.57]Really?
[244:58.95]A cantankerous, misanthropic, hairy old cuss like you would be great with kids.
[245:04.41]Hmm.
[245:05.27]Perhaps.
[245:06.38]Someday.
[245:08.42]Yeah, I don't want to rush you, Stinky, but if you're planning kids, you're gonna have to get on that pretty quick.
[245:17.36]We're health inspectors.
[245:49.42]That was a terrifyingly awful laughing lip sync.
[245:53.98]That was scarier than anything else.
[246:00.12]How are the 80s treating you, Stinky?
[246:01.84]What are you two still doing here?
[246:04.01]No animals allowed in my diner.
[246:06.37]It's okay.
[246:07.05]We're service animals.
[246:10.31]Can we be seated?
[246:10.85]Could we be seated already?
[246:12.59]No shirt, no shoes, no service.
[246:15.85]We're being discriminated against, Sam.
[246:19.40]We want to order something.
[246:20.84]Too bad.
[246:22.76]We'll take a pan-fried red panda with us.
[246:24.84]What?
[246:25.48]Can't you see I'm so close to perfecting my gooey molasses tar cake?
[246:31.72]I can't be arsed to cook for you hooligans when I got so much cooking to do.
[246:37.45]What's a gooey molasses tar cake?
[246:39.87]It's based on my ancient family recipe.
[246:43.49]But my proud knuckle-dragging forefathers never thought to use my secret ingredient.
[246:49.81]The blood of innocents!
[246:51.89]Not me.
[246:52.77]You're both wrong.
[246:53.68]And you're both stupid.
[246:55.64]It's the one thing no one has ever thought to use before.
[247:01.62]He's gonna spit in it.
[247:02.30]He's gonna pee in it.
[247:04.10]I'll test your tar cake for you, Stinky.
[247:06.08]Sam can and will eat anything.
[247:09.02]Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
[247:10.66]To just waltz into a restaurant and order something to eat.
[247:15.60]You're just trying to find out my secret ingredient.
[247:17.90]Well, you won't, because it's the one thing no one has ever thought to use.
[247:21.94]It's going to be like a beard hair or something.
[247:24.94]Thanks for the chat, Stinky.
[247:26.70]I just go away and die.
[247:28.66]But most of all, thanks for just being you.
[247:35.12]Looks like girl Stinky was telling the truth for once.
[247:38.24]The gooey molasses tar cake really is an old family recipe.
[247:42.21]Well, let's put this on you.
[247:46.91]Grandpa Stinky.
[247:48.65]What do we get?
[247:49.79]Weird.
[247:50.19]It doesn't work on him for some incomprehensible reason we don't care enough about to pursue further.
[247:54.91]Good.
[247:55.37]Keep your fancy Googles and who's your watch?
[247:57.85]It's away from me.
[248:01.63]Hmm.
[248:03.43]Interesting.
[248:08.74]It couldn't hurt to take just a sample.
[248:10.58]We should have those results for you in about a week, Mr. Cake.
[248:13.51]Now, turn your head and cough.
[248:15.83]Cake sample.
[248:17.41]Whee!
[248:21.67]Can they be scanned?
[248:22.83]I've already scanned myself with this thing.
[248:26.00]Alright, now let's go put the cake into the other thing and... Alright, let's go.
[248:32.32]Smell you later, homeboy.
[248:33.70]Totally.
[248:35.10]We're gonna have a cake baby.
[248:42.82]Let's go to Bosco's.
[248:55.73]See, I'm telling you, he spits in his cakes.
[248:59.73]Speaking of scanning, do you have a card?
[249:04.71]What was that?
[249:06.17]It printed a time card with a presidential seal and some strange numbers.
[249:16.24]Here we go.
[249:19.38]No, I'm pretty sure Bosco's father wasn't a tar cake.
[249:23.22]What?
[249:23.56]This sample has been completely contaminated by milk.
[249:26.44]It'll have to be replaced.
[249:30.48]What?
[249:31.88]Don't touch that.
[249:33.14]I made that sample when my spit was most fertile.
[249:36.86]This sample is... I can't... So what do I do with the tar cake sample?
[249:45.38]Not happening.
[249:47.90]I'm telling you, I'm going to have to get Bosco to spit in the jar.
[250:03.64]Let's put this in here.
[250:26.51]Look, Sam.
[250:27.39]It's my summer office.
[250:29.25]I don't think so, Max.
[250:30.49]Take a look around.
[250:32.43]George Washington.
[250:32.99]Welcome to the Oval Office, visitors.
[250:34.60]Next tour begins in 30 minutes.
[250:36.30]This is a long time before the horrific sequence of events that led to your presidency.
[250:41.16]I'm not leader of the free world here?
[250:43.78]This will not stand.
[250:44.74]But I have the tar cake sample.
[250:46.97]I need another sampler.
[250:47.81]Okay.
[250:56.60]This far in the past, I assumed the Earth was still flat.
[251:01.69]I'm guessing they couldn't fit a television on there.
[251:03.57]Alright.
[251:06.03]Okay.
[251:07.89]So what's going on now?
[251:14.04]I wonder who's in this picture.
[251:15.68]It probably came with the frame.
[251:17.64]Came with the frame.
[251:19.08]Anals of Americana.
[251:21.92]This is the war room.
[251:23.52]Rat hole.
[251:23.94]Hi, I'm George Washington.
[251:25.12]Shove your nuts in my mouth and I'll crack them.
[251:28.84]Please don't make fun of nuts.
[251:34.92]Hi, I'm George Washington.
[251:36.24]Shove your nuts in my mouth and I'll crack them.
[251:38.38]Please don't make fun of nuts.
[251:39.96]They really like dialed up.
[251:51.20]The like crazy shit in this episode, huh?
[251:55.14]Hi there, random Secret Service agent.
[251:57.48]I can answer any of your questions.
[251:59.00]Please don't touch anything.
[252:00.32]I'm Agent Superball.
[252:01.96]Superball?
[252:03.14]It's a code name, sir.
[252:04.52]I'm a bouncer.
[252:05.90]Secret Service humor.
[252:07.16]In the future, we know a guy who looks just like you with the same name.
[252:11.13]I've never seen you before.
[252:12.67]And there couldn't be another Agent Superball, sir.
[252:14.87]The code names are unique.
[252:16.87]Oh, Superball.
[252:18.59]I get it.
[252:23.09]And you spit.
[252:36.78]Where's the president?
[252:37.96]He's in the war room.
[252:39.10]Important national crisis.
[252:40.82]And when I said national crisis, I meant to say he's just watching television.
[252:44.60]We are not at the brink of war with Cuba.
[252:46.76]Alright, Sam, our mission is clear.
[252:49.05]Nuke the commie bastard!
[252:50.17]I think we've seen enough of the war room for one lifetime, Max.
[252:53.39]Yeah, you're right, Sam.
[252:54.75]Having to hurt people from a distance takes all the fun out of it anyway.
[252:59.63]Okay.
[253:01.58]What do you think of the president?
[253:03.08]He's the greatest man who ever lived, sir.
[253:05.70]Oh, these poor bastards of the 60s having to grow up in a world without David Arquette.
[253:11.99]God.
[253:13.49]How long have you been working for the White House?
[253:15.52]Just a few months.
[253:16.50]I've already been assigned my first door.
[253:18.32]That's all you do?
[253:19.26]Guard this door?
[253:20.82]Not at all, sir.
[253:21.86]I also provide tours, run the patent office, and narrate public service announcements.
[253:25.90]That's a lot of work for one man.
[253:28.15]I'm still new.
[253:28.99]In 40 years I'll be promoted to receptionist.
[253:32.65]What's the gossip?
[253:34.93]extra toes or nipples can't talk to the press without slices of ham stuffed down his pants stuff like that the president is beyond reproach sir I won't hear any more of it okay we need something we need your help with something official what will it be sir
[253:49.88]We want a narration.
[253:51.29]We want a patent.
[253:52.65]We want a narration.
[253:53.79]We want to hear you narrate a public service announcement.
[253:56.31]Alright.
[253:57.17]Are your cigarettes killing you?
[253:59.23]As unbelievable as it might seem, cigarettes made outside the U.S.
[254:02.73]actually contain chemicals that are addictive and possibly even harmful.
[254:06.21]For your own safety and that of your children, smoke only homeland-grown tobacco.
[254:10.49]The kind doctors recommend for your good health.
[254:13.30]Now you know.
[254:14.48]For a better America.
[254:17.42]Okay, um, we want a patent.
[254:19.42]We want exclusive rights to produce our latest invention.
[254:22.63]We wish to crush competing inventors to see them driven before us and hear the lamentations of their patent lawyers.
[254:28.79]Very well.
[254:29.57]What'll it be?
[254:30.51]What?
[254:31.33]Self-rocking baby crib cat litter formula.
[254:35.50]Gooey molasses tar cake.
[254:37.96]We'd like to patent our tar cake recipe, Superball.
[254:40.75]It's a special recipe we made up ourselves, and anybody who says different is a damn liar.
[254:45.85]I see.
[254:46.37]And what ingredient makes that a unique invention?
[254:49.57]I'm gonna say...
[255:01.26]And slap him with a DMCA takedown.
[255:06.53]It's probably like this one, or it's probably this one.
[255:10.15]Or this one, I don't know.
[255:13.97]It's probably the love one.
[255:15.83]That's like the easy one, right?
[255:17.93]It's made with love.
[255:19.33]I can't issue you a patent, sir.
[255:20.90]That ingredient is not in that sample.
[255:23.11]Come on, how could you possibly know that?
[255:25.93]I'm a government official, sir.
[255:27.55]I know these things.
[255:28.71]I'll need to know the unique ingredient to issue you a patent.
[255:31.24]Alright, well, come on.
[255:35.04]We need your... What will it be, sir?
[255:37.78]We want exclusive... Very well.
[255:40.50]Or tar cake.
[255:41.90]I see.
[255:42.56]And the ingredient is wombat guano.
[255:45.02]Quiescently frozen wombat guano.
[255:47.28]Sorry, sir.
[255:48.10]That ingredient is not in that sample.
[255:49.94]I'll need to know the unique ingredient.
[255:51.90]Well, I don't think I can do this, so might as well just scan them.
[255:58.63]You printed a time card with our logo on it.
[256:01.25]You're brute forcing patents.
[256:08.09]OK, well, I can't do that.
[256:09.99]What was the other one?
[256:10.65]There's another option here.
[256:12.79]We need your help.
[256:13.87]What will it be?
[256:15.76]A tour.
[256:16.36]We'd like a tour of the office.
[256:18.08]Very well, sir.
[256:19.24]That's a desk.
[256:20.04]There's a couch.
[256:21.04]Another couch is there.
[256:22.34]A calendar.
[256:23.10]Some pictures.
[256:24.02]The door you see behind me is 100% Northwestern White Pine with an interior flat jam in it.
[256:28.26]That's plenty, thanks.
[256:30.88]OK.
[256:32.12]We want to hear another public service announcement.
[256:34.50]Do you know how to recognize a communist?
[256:37.22]Look for the telltale signs.
[256:38.90]All communists are double-jointed in their necks and elbows to aid them as they steal American secrets.
[256:44.38]Communists also secrete a brownish, viscous residue from their palms, which can be found on their homes, children, and pets.
[256:51.99]Now you know for a better America.
[256:55.87]Jesus.
[256:56.53]Just keep guarding that door.
[256:58.19]Gladly, sir.
[256:59.11]I just went, oh, Jesus Christ.
[257:03.86]We came here from the far off future.
[257:06.55]Aren't you amazed and surprised?
[257:08.67]Isn't that shocking?
[257:09.99]I've seen a lot of things, sir.
[257:11.67]It takes a lot to shock me.
[257:13.30]Oh, really?
[257:13.86]Okay.
[257:16.10]Uh, we can shock you.
[257:16.86]I bet we could surprise you.
[257:18.20]Can't be done, sir.
[257:19.28]I'm imperturbable.
[257:25.96]Uh, we're from the future.
[257:27.22]What was that water?
[257:28.10]Glass of water.
[257:28.60]Give me that water.
[257:50.54]Can we get that water?
[257:51.14]He's gonna spit in our faces.
[257:52.30]Hmm.
[258:33.72]Keep up the good work.
[258:34.94]We have to do something shocking and he's going to spit that into our face.
[258:42.71]Cork?
[258:44.65]No.
[258:46.01]No.
[258:46.73]This is not going to be shocking, I don't think.
[258:48.39]Better not.
[258:49.23]Better not.
[258:52.49]No, we got a new time card.
[258:58.12]I think we have all the time.
[258:58.98]No, there's one more we're missing.
[259:02.38]One final missing time card after this one.
[259:05.90]So, let's... Hold on a minute here.
[259:07.92]We need to go... We haven't gone here.
[259:13.46]Have we gone here?
[259:14.38]I don't think we've gone here yet.
[259:25.44]Just give him the jock jock shock jock.
[259:27.30]The future?
[259:29.92]I love old Sam.
[259:30.58]Old Sam is the best character, I already know.
[259:33.36]Alright, hold on here.
[259:34.08]There's a volcano.
[259:35.42]They're boomers.
[259:56.70]What's in here?
[259:57.14]Is he still in here?
[259:59.65]Oh, jeez.
[260:01.21]That's a lot.
[260:01.77]I hate pack rats.
[260:08.25]It says, stinky stick-tied adhesive.
[260:10.97]Based on an old family recipe.
[260:13.35]Number one throughout the entire galaxy.
[260:15.98]With secret ingredient, bitumen 13.
[260:17.74]Bitumen 13.
[260:18.56]It can't be all that big a secret if it's on the poster.
[260:21.98]Maybe secrets are different in the future. 13.
[260:26.87]Bingo.
[260:30.37]We got it.
[260:33.21]Hello, future me.
[260:34.88]I can't shoot, Max.
[260:36.76]Apparently, all those years of adventuring have taken their toll.
[260:40.14]I can't use these things together.
[260:45.68]Scan him?
[260:46.10]No, we already scanned him.
[260:47.54]Hiya, future Max.
[260:48.86]Oh, hey, guys.
[260:50.18]Look, Sam, more visitors for your special day.
[260:53.64]Comically backwards past versions of ourselves.
[260:57.11]No, I want to keep these shoestrings.
[260:59.94]That's nice, Sam.
[261:03.02]So this is the future.
[261:04.38]A baffling potpourri of peculiar sights and odors.
[261:07.60]Yes, our advanced world must be frightening and confusing to you.
[261:11.68]I'll try to speak slowly so that your 21st century brains can understand.
[261:19.16]How did we do this?
[261:21.65]Do you remember how we cured Bosco of his parentage problems?
[261:24.59]Bosco... Oh, he's the guy who invented Skynet, isn't he?
[261:29.17]No, I was hoping I'd be the one who did that.
[261:32.52]I don't remember much about that case.
[261:35.02]Something about spit, wasn't it?
[261:40.79]So much in the office has changed.
[261:42.88]Oh, the wonders I could show the two of you if I wasn't afraid of violating the time stream.
[261:48.46]Yeah, the time stream's asking for it.
[261:50.38]Streaming right now?
[261:51.24]Well, okay.
[261:52.08]Nice, man.
[261:52.64]In the future, we can make phone calls to other people even when we're not at home.
[261:59.24]My God!
[262:00.80]And our cars now have additional brake lights above the rear seats.
[262:08.79]Everybody hates that so much.
[262:15.39]It gives me energy.
[262:17.71]Okay.
[262:20.01]Any interesting future cases?
[262:20.97]You must have been having a ton of exciting future adventures in space.
[262:24.08]No, we don't take that many cases anymore.
[262:26.60]We try to stay mostly around this street and the neighboring shops.
[262:30.24]Still?
[262:34.20]I'm glad to see the old freelance police are still in business.
[262:37.15]Are we in business?
[262:37.81]Yes, dear stupid past Sam.
[262:39.99]But of course, now we're a wholly owned subsidiary of Stinky Corp.
[262:44.90]So Stinky Corp took over the whole world.
[262:47.64]What's Stinky Corp?
[262:49.62]Get a load of this, Sam.
[262:51.26]These yokels have never heard of Stinky Corp.
[262:55.08]I don't feel like playing darts right now.
[262:58.08]Yes.
[262:58.86]Well, anyway, Stinky Corp is the megacorporation that owns everything in the future.
[263:03.85]Stinky made enough money from her diner to take over the world?
[263:07.69]No, no, Cretinous Max.
[263:09.87]From her super adhesive.
[263:14.12]Mole men?
[263:14.60]Bitumen 13.
[263:39.56]That's my hangout with you.
[264:08.75]Can we just hang out together?
[264:12.31]And we can just look at... We can just look out the window and stuff.
[264:16.91]If you're not taking cases, what do you guys do?
[264:19.33]I've become an expert in volcanology.
[264:21.15]And Sam is... Well, Sam is in his own world now.
[264:26.16]Great transmogrifying vapor of wolves of Rigel 17.
[264:31.20]Booster rocket through the Van Allen Belt.
[264:33.60]I'm in my office.
[264:38.80]Get rid of this one.
[264:41.98]What's this about stinky super adhesive?
[264:44.28]It revolutionized the whole galaxy.
[264:46.84]Now it's used for spacecraft.
[264:48.51]She's cleared out the real stuff.
[264:50.59]It's made from... Okay.
[264:53.99]What's wrong with the other me?
[264:55.53]Oh, he's fine.
[264:56.91]Mostly.
[264:58.07]The years add up, though.
[265:00.27]It's lint from my pocket.
[265:02.18]This should be useful later.
[265:05.37]Alright.
[265:05.61]We gotta go... Gotta go talk to the mole.
[265:07.25]Can't do anything with the... I have a screwdriver, a cork, a sampler, I have a Taro sampler.
[265:10.09]Okay, so I still have a sampler.
[265:26.74]I need to get him to spit into my face.
[265:29.12]And then scrape it off and put it in there.
[265:31.20]But first, we need to... Uh, we need to go... We gotta find the mold.
[265:53.95]Did I do all the... I can't reach it.
[265:55.50]What do you mean, I can't reach it?
[265:57.84]I probably take this off at some point, right?
[266:00.76]Alright, let's go here.
[266:01.40]We haven't gone here yet.
[266:29.81]heaping helpings of tachyons in a gravy boat at the grand duchess's bat mitra what disgusting hellhole have we ended up in this time looks strangely familiar like super ball I'm not here sirs you can safely ignore me is he following us around boxing Betty remote max have you been sending boxy Betty to what hey buddy throw us that remote control would you

[267:00.17]And... Alright.
[267:01.67]Are we looping into each other?
[267:03.17]Are we... Am I gonna throw that egg up there in like 20 minutes?
[267:07.40]Probably.
[267:07.64]Investigating the president's disappearance, sir.
[267:26.83]So, you're back with the Secret Service, then?
[267:29.51]Mmm, sure.
[267:31.55]Okay, well, it's getting interesting.
[267:34.24]We got beamed on board a spaceship!
[267:37.42]That's ridiculous, sir.
[267:38.84]Must have been a weather balloon.
[267:40.36]That was no balloon!
[267:41.70]It was a spaceship!
[267:43.14]Bosco saw it, too!
[267:44.76]Gas leak.
[267:45.62]Mass hypnosis.
[267:46.84]Two abductions on the same street in the same week?
[267:49.70]And you're going to just try and cover it up?
[267:52.10]I can neither confirm nor deny a cover-up, sir.
[267:55.25]god can you help us with our case what seems to be the problem bosco's been abducted easily explained sir and he's trapped on a time-traveling spaceship there's no such thing as time travel sir look into my eyes please what were we talking about you'd said that Mr. bosco is having a perfectly rational vacation in pago pago yes pago pago
[268:24.93]Hey, look, Max.
[268:26.13]It's Agent Superball.
[268:27.71]You were saying something, sir.
[268:33.76]Very good, sir.
[268:37.44]We met a guy in Washington who's a Dead Ringer for you.
[268:40.14]That would be me, sir.
[268:41.52]That was 40 years ago.
[268:43.12]You couldn't still look that young without a time machine or something.
[268:46.50]He's going forward.
[268:47.63]There's no such thing as time machines.
[268:55.16]What the hell?
[268:59.16]Don't you feel better now that you're no longer working for bad guys like Jorgen?
[269:02.88]He's timeless.
[269:04.50]I enjoy working for the Secret Service, fighting the good fight, protecting the president.
[269:09.51]That reminds me, Sam.
[269:10.97]Can we wrap this case up pretty soon?
[269:13.79]I've got a healthcare system and five foreign governments to topple.
[269:17.38]And I'm way behind schedule.
[269:20.52]Okay, so...
[269:22.79]How's the wife and kids?
[269:23.63]Alright, so we need to, um...
[269:52.60]Hey, stay positive, SuperBall.
[269:53.18]Don't worry, SuperBall.
[269:54.24]Every time life closes one door, it opens another.
[269:57.89]That thought disgusts and terrifies me, sir.
[270:02.13]So what do you... Why do you have a door?
[270:04.01]We can't seem to avoid it.
[270:05.33]Alright, so you've been scanned.
[270:08.89]What if it's a different SuperBall?
[270:12.05]So it's the same person.
[270:13.57]Yes, it is.
[270:14.15]Just was making sure.
[270:15.47]What if they were lying?
[270:16.27]What if there's more than one?
[270:17.27]Alright.
[270:17.61]We have an egg.
[270:18.29]I need to go find the mole.
[270:20.55]Stinkies?
[270:20.81]Where's that mole?
[270:21.31]Sibyl?
[270:21.49]Where's Sibyl?
[270:41.87]Who have I not scanned?
[270:50.05]Can I say the secret ingredient?
[271:04.34]I wonder if that, if I can say, Bitumen 13!
[271:10.82]We need your help with something.
[271:12.26]What will it be?
[271:13.46]Patent.
[271:13.90]We want exclusive rights to produce.
[271:15.82]Very well.
[271:17.88]Tar cake.
[271:18.26]We'd like to patent our tar cake recipes.
[271:20.30]I see.
[271:21.16]Secret ingredient is vitamin 13.
[271:22.78]Vitamin 13.
[271:24.06]Very well.
[271:24.74]That seems to check out.
[271:25.66]Okay, so now we own the patent.
[271:29.28]That patent grants you exclusive rights to make, market, and improve on your invention.
[271:33.54]This must be just what Thomas Edison felt like.
[271:36.44]minus the stealing on time travel of course oh sam you're so naive so now we have the patent for we have the patent for the cake so now we go back to where the cake is and we do is he gonna have we have a different conversation about the cake
[272:08.63]Let's go back here and see... Let's go to the office.
[272:16.31]Are we going to be on that poster?
[272:17.45]We're not even here anymore.
[272:30.30]You're still here, but... Oh, this is the wrong one.
[272:33.56]Wrong one.
[272:33.88]Wrong one.
[272:39.93]Hold on, wait.
[272:41.73]Good place for a bath.
[272:42.83]Right in front of the window.
[272:46.41]Remember Easter Island?
[272:48.15]Yeah, me either.
[272:49.39]The floor of Brady has twice the style the fauna one ever did.
[272:53.70]Turn on the TV.
[272:55.14]There's nothing good on.
[272:56.20]Is it news?
[272:56.86]Can we see the data?
[272:57.48]What?
[272:59.90]What?
[273:12.81]I like that one better.
[273:13.57]That was my laugh.
[273:18.73]What's going on?
[273:20.83]What the fuck was that?
[273:21.95]What am I doing?
[273:26.39]I'm like fucking myself up here.
[273:49.94]God damn it.
[273:50.76]Whatever.
[273:51.10]Alright, so I have the patent.
[273:55.44]I need to go to the future.
[273:59.79]Not stinkies.
[274:08.79]Elmo?
[274:11.33]I kind of sound like Elmo.
[274:16.33]Alright, so hey, look.
[274:18.27]We...
[274:19.44]It says stinky stick-tied adhesive based on an old family recipe with secret ingredient vitamin 13.
[274:26.37]What?
[274:28.51]Sue him.
[274:29.65]We get the patent.
[274:31.61]No siree.
[274:32.23]100 years in the future, I'm going to patent that.
[274:50.51]Well, sorry, Stinky.
[274:55.92]Sorry, Stinky.
[274:57.51]But we're gonna have to, uh... claim that cake.
[275:05.73]We have to insist that you cease and desist all future production of gooey molasses tar cakes, Mr. Stinky.
[275:10.99]This is very unfair.
[275:11.91]We're not angry at you for stealing from us, just very, very disappointed.
[275:16.33]Poppycock, that recipe's been in my family for centuries.
[275:20.89]Now we'll go further back.
[275:21.61]The U.S.
[275:21.75]Patent Office says otherwise, Gramps.
[275:24.35]The U.S.
[275:25.73]Patent Office can my puss-filled .
[275:31.01]Actually, I don't believe that falls under their jurisdiction.
[275:34.14]Uh-oh.
[275:34.26]Alright, so we have the
[275:46.89]the AI now, so is that it?
[275:49.53]Sorry about that, Patton.
[275:50.57]Hope you're still not holding a grudge about that tar cake business.
[275:53.71]I hold on to grudges like a man pushed overboard holds on to a ship's rail, clinging to it with bleeding fingers as the one thing saving him from a fatal plunge into the briny abyss.
[276:07.20]We missed you, Stinky.
[276:09.96]Oh, that's interesting.
[276:10.80]That's cool.
[276:13.87]So the AI can't stick on anymore because it's using the adhesive that they no longer make.
[276:22.84]So now what happens in the future?
[276:24.06]I'm just curious to see if this is any different.
[276:44.96]Uh-oh.
[276:45.08]Alright.
[276:46.22]Any new dialog here?
[277:00.25]What happened to Stinky?
[277:00.89]Have you heard from Stinky lately?
[277:02.69]Of course, dim-witted Sam.
[277:05.09]She owns the megacorporation that owns everything in the future.
[277:09.18]How'd she manage that?
[277:10.80]She invented a spray that repels reanimated zombie hands.
[277:14.06]It turned out to be surprisingly lucrative.
[277:16.26]Still did alright, apparently.
[277:18.18]So long.
[277:18.60]What was that big elaborate goodbye?
[277:25.17]Hey, hold on.
[277:25.75]Wait a minute.
[277:28.27]Will that... Can I give that to him?
[277:36.36]This thing is just like a computer, right?
[277:40.92]Will this actually do what I think it's gonna do?
[277:43.37]Affordable AI.
[277:46.17]Are you gonna do this?
[277:50.51]Will this work?
[277:51.83]Yeah.
[277:59.82]Whatever, kid.
[278:00.94]This is exactly what I needed for my video game.
[278:03.89]I'll just download the AI.
[278:05.71]Yeah, you do that.
[278:07.15]Then go outside and play or something.
[278:11.43]Fine.
[278:12.05]Shoot all the bad guys.
[278:13.73]I'll just have to make more, but no problem.
[278:16.81]Bitchin'!
[278:17.85]You made the game even friendlier!
[278:19.57]Oh, he's the passive-aggressive.
[278:20.47]The personality matrix is rejecting the new programming.
[278:22.93]I'll change it back.
[278:24.21]Nice try!
[278:25.31]You almost hit it.
[278:26.53]That's better.
[278:31.91]Okay.
[278:34.17]What is an egg?
[278:42.80]I want to throw the egg up.
[278:48.54]We gotta go.
[278:49.28]Oh, we gotta go here.
[278:52.14]Where's, um... Let's go home.
[278:55.66]The personality of the thing has to be really nice.
[279:03.48]You gotta have a really, really good personality.
[279:06.58]Really happy, friendly one.
[279:12.59]Uh, system settings.
[279:13.45]What are my options?
[279:14.57]My personality can be configured to respond in the style most appropriate to the user.
[279:20.11]Please choose from the following options.
[279:22.35]Well, actually, no, they play it because it's tuned for nice.
[279:27.83]But wouldn't I want it to be, um...
[279:32.19]Oh, yeah, I wanted to be, like, really, really... Abusive.
[279:39.46]Good choice, moron.
[279:41.22]Did you come up with that yourself, or did your idiot friend help out?
[279:44.62]Hold on.
[279:48.25]Let me see the other ones.
[279:50.11]What are my options?
[279:51.03]My personality, please.
[279:53.41]It's abusive suggestive.
[279:55.17]Suggestive.
[279:56.51]Oh, that is exactly...
[280:07.32]What the fuck?
[280:08.22]This is like... No, I'm not using that one.
[280:09.68]We're doing abusive.
[280:10.22]Let's try it.
[280:35.05]Suggestive or riot.
[280:37.71]No, I'm not doing suggestive.
[280:53.77]Take another look at this talking computer dingus, kid.
[280:57.39]Thanks, mister.
[280:57.99]I want some!
[281:05.20]So now he's mean.
[281:05.74]We make him awful.
[281:06.38]You brought the game, Sam?
[281:07.70]Nuh-uh.
[281:08.52]I made it better.
[281:09.40]Go back to your name, grabber!
[281:12.60]This, like, totally blows now.
[281:14.72]Let's go to that dance and make the moves on some chicks.
[281:17.72]But I was going to Penn Station to pick up some power converters.
[281:21.97]Beat it, nerds!
[281:23.49]Make sure you check out the snack table, little me.
[281:26.01]If I remember correctly, the pigs in blankets were decadent.
[281:30.33]Timestream altered.
[281:32.53]Check us.
[281:34.18]So, Max, feel any different?
[281:36.39]I feel like it's been too long since the Maxinator taught a lady what sweet, sweet love is all about.
[281:43.09]That guy just happy Gilmore'd me.
[281:44.35]So we can pick up some primo early 80s tales, bro.
[281:46.89]You suck, you jackass.
[281:50.19]It's our old pal, Bluster Blaster.
[281:51.91]Alright, can we do anything else with you?
[281:58.11]I really don't want to screw that.
[282:00.36]It's our old pal, Bluster.
[282:01.98]Okay, so now they left.
[282:07.37]There's just the one song.
[282:09.27]As Stinky would say, if you don't like it, go deaf.
[282:13.49]Alright, what have we got in our inventory?
[282:16.49]Let's take a look.
[282:18.93]We've got... The egg, the cake sample.
[282:24.64]Which, we don't really need that anymore.
[282:26.28]The AI we've used... We need to get... We need to get spit on.
[282:34.74]What's a cork for?
[282:45.13]Can you scan inorganic things?
[282:47.60]I've already... No, no, I want to scan this.
[282:53.70]No way.
[282:57.62]Yeah, I've already scanned both of us.
[282:59.16]I've already scanned... The guy in the suit has to spit on me.
[283:04.98]Superball has to spit on us.
[283:06.50]And I have to capture it.
[283:08.30]How do I get him to do that?
[283:14.66]Mmm, something shocking in this book.
[283:15.94]I'm still missing a card.
[283:38.54]It's the official calendar of the United States.
[283:41.20]The best part of being president is changing the date for the entire country.
[283:45.15]I don't want to change the date right now.
[283:46.95]I'm temporarily confused enough as it is.
[283:50.15]Whee!
[283:51.85]I don't think I have anything.
[283:53.11]Let's see.
[283:55.32]Do I have any other options?
[284:00.00]No, I don't have anything here.
[284:02.46]Alright, we give up.
[284:04.84]Keep up the good work.
[284:06.07]Thank you, sir.
[284:06.65]Let me go back to... Get spit on.
[284:12.73]Put in the thing.
[284:13.71]Hold on.
[284:30.22]oh hello miss b did it get freaky sexy in here or is it just you what'd you do to my max the better question is what is he he went to go like hang out with girls right all night long don't look at me miss bosco he's been like this ever since we were kids
[284:52.30]So you can give me a special tour of the store.
[284:55.78]I've been wanting to see what you've got round back.
[285:00.33]I thought you were different, Max.
[285:02.83]That does it.
[285:03.69]I'm done with all of you.
[285:05.63]Men.
[285:06.49]Temporal anomaly corrected.
[285:08.11]Jackass.
[285:11.43]Alright, so that... Is there anything in here?
[285:14.97]We need to get the spit from the guy to put in here to make the baby.
[285:23.17]Did I miss something?
[285:23.89]Let me check the bathroom.
[285:25.58]Did I miss something in here?
[285:31.92]Wine?
[285:32.46]Can I take the wine?
[285:33.80]No, it has to be there.
[285:37.16]Nothing else can do anything else in here.
[285:39.26]Alright, so... Let's go through them again.
[285:51.23]Anything else?
[285:54.62]Hot dogs?
[285:58.94]Hmm.
[286:00.24]Well, not here.
[286:06.34]Let's just see.
[286:06.72]I'm gonna go through them again.
[286:07.89]See if I missed anything.
[286:14.73]We'll take a gander.
[286:21.21]That was a weird rumor.
[286:22.13]That was like a rumor that was run out of gas on the road.
[286:25.01]Alright, you need to spit on me.
[286:30.88]Spit on me.
[286:33.46]How's the cover-up going?
[286:34.90]Very well, sir.
[286:36.51]Is what I'd say if there was a cover-up, which there isn't.
[286:41.49]Be seeing you, Super Bowl.
[286:48.14]I'm surprised this game survived being thrown clear of the Playland and Casino explosion.
[286:52.64]Not nearly as surprised as the guy it landed on.
[287:05.05]I wasn't really expecting to play this.
[287:07.27]It just happened.
[287:08.67]I didn't think it was still working.
[287:09.93]Still got 20.
[287:15.03]I didn't think it was going to even pop up.
[287:16.33]I just started shooting randomly.
[287:39.28]Eagle statue.
[287:40.28]I'm guessing they couldn't... A true weasel scout would keep his merit badges on him at all times.
[287:45.74]Be prepared!
[287:47.06]Be very prepared!
[287:52.18]No, there's nothing in here.
[287:54.00]Whoever chose this land was taking liberties with the concept of good taste.
[287:57.66]I didn't even... there's another little section down here?
[287:59.50]Oh, that looks like a perfect please-take-me item, doesn't it?
[288:04.12]Oh, well.
[288:17.72]I can... no, keep... what are you doing?
[288:18.86]I'm just gonna go through them all, and I'm gonna look around.
[288:27.10]I obviously have something I still don't have.
[288:42.97]Come again.
[288:44.31]Reviews.
[288:44.79]Memorable toast with blaster.
[289:00.99]Devil memorabilia letter display.
[289:02.91]Check this out.
[289:03.97]It's from 1963.
[289:04.39]And it's signed by the president.
[289:07.79]My dearest Maxine.
[289:09.65]Meet me tonight at Stinky's.
[289:11.91]Wear that dress I like.
[289:13.37]The one where I can see your... Holy.
[289:16.05]I didn't think they knew that word back then.
[289:18.33]The president's wife wasn't named Maxine.
[289:21.07]What is this?
[289:21.83]The Temperance League?
[289:23.31]Lighten up!
[289:24.37]Looks like this case has a screw loose.
[289:27.97]Oh.
[289:29.83]Well...
[289:32.55]I've got something for that!
[289:33.37]Classic cartoon.
[289:34.35]Classic cartoon, gotcha.
[289:35.21]What about this one?
[289:37.22]Alright, so we've got like a- Alright, here we go.
[289:40.16]Time to get it.
[289:42.42]Let's do it.
[289:43.22]I'm ready.
[289:44.40]Let's put a cap in this case.
[289:45.34]Check it out.
[289:45.68]Ready?
[290:06.00]Oh, I'm ready.
[290:13.06]Are you ready?
[290:13.56]To have this person... Undulate liquid out of their mouth.
[290:21.36]Directly into my face.
[290:30.66]Sip.
[290:32.04]Sip.
[290:33.27]My dearest Maxine, meet me tonight.
[290:38.35]Tender caresses down your... And a donkey.
[290:42.47]Love, the Prez.
[290:43.81]That's very shocking, sir.
[290:45.17]Where were they going to meet?
[290:46.49]Inside Stinky's Diner.
[290:49.21]Get it!
[290:49.53]Stinky's?
[290:51.23]I can't believe the president would eat at Stinky's.
[290:53.59]I've lost all respect to the man.
[290:59.16]I'll take that.
[291:00.34]And now we can complete it.
[291:05.47]Super Bowl.
[291:07.35]Excellent.
[291:08.97]Let's go put it in the machine.
[291:10.01]Let's make the baby.
[291:10.83]Let's see.
[291:14.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[291:16.12]I didn't mean to click.
[291:16.74]Didn't mean to click.
[291:17.36]It's okay.
[291:33.45]He misclicked.
[291:34.61]He's a bad gamer.
[291:36.09]Unbelievable.
[291:37.20]I can't even comprehend how somebody could click on the wrong thing.
[291:43.60]Get him!
[291:47.06]Okay, here we go.
[291:54.54]See?
[291:57.93]See?
[292:00.13]That was great.
[292:01.99]That was an unbelievable fucking reference to what we were talking about like fucking two hours ago.
[292:07.47]Unbelievable.
[292:09.19]You get like the stamp of comedy approval.
[292:12.38]Time stream altered.
[292:14.58]Jackass.
[292:15.10]Alright, turn it on.
[292:18.68]It's Mama Bosco's baby making machine.
[292:21.06]The mother sample is locked, but the father sample is open.
[292:23.91]Alright, so let's go.
[292:25.55]It's a sample of Agent Superball's spit.
[292:29.54]It's Mama Bosco's baby.
[292:30.86]The mother sampled it.
[292:32.52]Wait, do we just have to go in the future now?
[292:38.45]Can we just leave?
[292:39.15]Is that all we need to do?
[292:40.59]Is he going to be fine?
[292:46.81]Bosco!
[292:47.71]You're back to normal!
[292:49.13]Hello, fool.
[292:50.02]Mr. President Fool.
[292:50.98]Hmm.
[292:52.06]I suspect we got the wrong dad, Max.
[292:59.78]So, Bosco, are you feeling like yourself?
[293:02.74]Of course, sir.
[293:03.77]Never better.
[293:04.19]Oh, my God.
[293:05.73]Okay, tell us about you.
[293:07.93]Can't you give us any more details on your father?
[293:10.31]It's straightforward enough, fool.
[293:12.27]I was a test tube baby, first in the country.
[293:14.97]No idea who'd make a spit donation to your mom?
[293:18.18]No more cracks about my mama, Mr. President, or I'll have to ask you to step outside.
[293:26.38]Don't worry, Bosco.
[293:27.62]We'll get you back to normal.
[293:29.12]Thank you, fool.
[293:30.44]I suggest you hurry.
[293:32.90]Even when he's riding us, he's too polite.
[293:35.20]It's unnerving.
[293:41.18]How are we going to get off this spaceship?
[293:43.20]Hadn't given it much thought, sir.
[293:44.38]Don't you care about CHEM coming back to kill you?
[293:48.80]Not really, sir.
[293:49.90]I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
[293:51.34]I don't like Bosco like this, Max.
[293:54.01]We've got to get him back to his paranoid self.
[293:59.35]That's pretty fucking funny.
[294:02.17]Don't worry, Bosco.
[294:03.41]We'll get you back to normal.
[294:04.91]Thank you, fool.
[294:06.25]I suggest you hurry.
[294:08.69]Even when he's riding us, he's too polite.
[294:10.99]It's unnerving.
[294:11.92]Alright, I got to get out of this.
[294:16.92]Will this work?
[294:19.08]Bosco already scanned himself with this thing.
[294:24.27]Do we have no more dialog?
[294:26.35]How do we fix this?
[294:26.99]What do we do with the egg?
[294:56.38]I mean, Oval Office?
[295:14.97]So we can't get in here.
[295:15.95]Anything else we can do?
[295:21.31]Official tour?
[295:23.94]No.
[295:24.66]Just keep going.
[295:27.66]Keep up the good work.
[295:28.86]Thank you, sir.
[295:38.69]Nope.
[295:39.23]I don't know what I was thinking there.
[295:43.21]The father of our country.
[295:47.43]I wonder who's in this picture.
[295:49.09]It probably came with the frame.
[295:54.63]I still have a... Okay, I have a cork that I still have.
[295:58.43]Can I scan the painting?
[296:03.29]That wouldn't do anything.
[296:03.87]Nothing doing.
[296:04.53]No, that's not going to do anything.
[296:09.73]According to that letter, this isn't the only thing the president licked.
[296:16.85]Should be plenty of DNA-rich spit left on this envelope.
[296:20.08]The president's a very thorough licker.
[296:25.19]I would have fucking missed that forever.
[296:28.09]I would have walked back and forth a hundred times.
[296:30.47]Coyotes?
[296:45.39]Yeah.
[296:55.85]Alright, let's try this again.
[297:02.25]I need to fill a test tube with something before I can put it in here.
[297:05.25]Huh?
[297:07.49]Oh.
[297:10.47]Okay.
[297:11.67]Time stream altered.
[297:13.08]Time stream altered again.
[297:14.88]Is it... Do we do it?
[297:31.70]done looks like we did a pretty good job patching up that cigarette burn on the fabric of reality yeah that's right ladies come on up and give daddy max time fixer some sugar you're a lovably lecherous tool max there's salmon max now you've seen just how dangerous it is to mess with t-h-e-l dangerous all that stuff we just fixed was your fault shut up alright let's go home how do we get out of here
[298:03.55]Yeah, they're probably the grotesque but misunderstood kind of aliens who just come to Earth because they hate cows and fields of weed You two go first
[298:21.85]We've never seen Boss go from waist down before.
[298:24.41]Crushing 98% complete.
[298:26.95]Prepare to deliver on my mark.
[298:30.80]It's T-H-E-M!
[298:35.28]Oh, bienvenidos, amigos.
[298:37.24]We've never seen you from the waist down.
[298:38.66]What are you guys doing here?
[298:40.58]We can explain everything, quickly and simply.
[298:43.99]No, that is not our way.
[298:46.49]Ahem.
[298:55.38]Thank you for watching!
[299:22.59]Don't we have frogs?
[299:25.59]Are there frog mariachis?
[299:26.99]They're frogs, right?
[299:41.03]now
[299:52.13]But spaceships like this are expensive, even more when they travel through time.
[300:00.04]And singing for birthdays on spec makes us poco dinero.
[300:07.72]So we took on a contract and asked our new boss to co-sign.
[300:11.35]Marley achieved.
[300:13.59]Ay, ay, ay, ay.
[300:14.61]We take souls of the damned and we send them to places unknown.
[300:20.01]I don't want to go!
[300:21.98]Where do they go?
[300:24.18]Our lives suck.
[300:50.62]Are they gonna kill Bosco?
[300:51.92]Is he dead?
[300:56.33]Oh, the cowman has had a heart attack.
[301:00.73]Bosco's dead.
[301:03.03]Oh, well.
[301:04.09]Begin the soul-crushing.
[301:06.83]So, as I was saying, we had to sit and stare at nothing for 1,000 years straight.
[301:15.04]Help me, Salmon Max!
[301:22.21]Okay.
[301:25.07]Um... Um... Um... The suck button.
[301:31.62]It says suck.
[301:32.84]By the looks of this place, somebody's been pushing the hell out of it.
[301:41.38]Time controls.
[301:42.85]Looks like some weird clock.
[301:44.69]It can't take hundreds of years to crush a soul, senor.
[301:48.19]So we make the time vortex to speed things along.
[301:53.29]Why are we not being, like, reprimanded or something?
[301:55.67]I'm just kidding.
[301:56.77]My name really is Pedro.
[302:26.25]You've got to free Bosco, you maniacs.
[302:28.77]Not impersonal, but... Rumor!
[302:30.85]Rumor just went by.
[302:31.65]That was a lot of rumor.
[302:32.45]We were scheduled to pick up two souls in Germany, but we only got the one.
[302:37.64]The cowman will fill our quota.
[302:44.39]where are the cages well if you're delivering trapped souls where are the cages cages we don't got no cages we don't have to show you any stinking cages we keep the souls on that platform see yeah but where do they go after that
[303:01.94]You guys are pure evil.
[303:04.08]Oh, that's not nice.
[303:05.78]We're no evil.
[303:07.45]And after we deliver the cowman's soul, we'll have paid for the spaceship.
[303:13.11]And then you can quit.
[303:15.23]Oh, no, senor.
[303:17.05]There's still so much for us to do with our time machine.
[303:21.75]So many deep questions left to answer.
[303:25.53]Like, what about the far, far future?
[303:29.69]How will I die?
[303:30.67]I can find out.
[303:31.45]I can think of a few ways.
[303:33.37]And what is it like at the beginning of time, before history was written, which came first, the chicken or the egg?
[303:43.91]Chicken.
[303:44.17]Egg.
[303:44.81]Egg.
[303:45.47]It's the egg.
[303:46.03]I have it in my inventory.
[303:47.45]See, I must keep on until I find out for sure.
[303:52.32]Egg.
[303:55.18]Here, I got the egg.
[303:56.40]See you later, guys.
[303:59.00]right here hey check this out what is that it's from uh the beginning of uh keep cool sam oh my god it's just the egg it's from the beginning of the universe you're a terrible liar senor perro oh I admit it now do you understand why I wouldn't make you vice president
[304:27.14]You're just dead on the ground.
[304:28.18]Wait.
[304:28.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[304:31.99]It worked!
[304:32.33]No!
[304:51.78]Hey, a portable birthday checker.
[304:54.86]Pretty clever.
[304:56.62]How come it doesn't work on you?
[304:58.22]The mariachi can never have a birthday for himself.
[305:02.82]It is our curse.
[305:05.20]What the fuck?
[305:07.99]Alright, what's over here?
[305:09.47]Bridge button.
[305:11.69]Attempt to enter soul-crushing area.
[305:14.47]Please acknowledge.
[305:16.05]How do we stop him from doing this?
[305:18.01]Can I scan the soul?
[305:18.86]Scan these?
[305:19.60]You.
[305:19.76]You in the back.
[305:21.24]You right there.
[305:42.05]Ahhhh.
[305:42.27]What's this photo of?
[305:42.89]It may look like a zebra, but my Mexican friends assure me it's a donkey in zebra clothing.
[305:48.85]Okay.
[305:51.44]Whee!
[305:54.18]Oh, what, what's, what, what?
[305:55.22]Items.
[305:57.52]AI, the cake, the cork.
[306:04.65]What's this?
[306:05.39]Printer?
[306:08.67]It's some weird alien device that... Oops.
[306:11.07]What the fuck?
[306:12.19]Not again.
[306:13.44]Just leave it.
[306:15.00]Seems like everything on this ship is forced apart these days.
[306:18.92]It looks like some kind of futuristic low-tech printer.
[306:22.80]It's an ink ribbon for the printer.
[306:24.34]Please don't touch that.
[306:25.58]Do I have one of those?
[306:26.12]I just have to change it again.
[306:29.27]I had an ink ribbon before.
[306:30.43]Alright.
[306:31.31]Screwdriver?
[306:32.69]Gun?
[306:33.03]Cork?
[306:34.21]No.
[306:35.03]Stuff it in there?
[306:36.01]Shoot it.
[306:36.67]Break it.
[306:40.73]Come on.
[306:43.57]AI.
[306:44.07]Egg.
[306:45.11]Cake.
[306:47.87]Screwdriver.
[306:48.49]Don't touch that, don't touch that, don't touch that.
[307:01.60]It's the mariachi's colorful piñata.
[307:10.47]Steel pinatas?
[307:11.69]Steel.
[307:12.21]People of the future are kind of missing the point.
[307:15.39]Steel piñata?
[307:18.04]What the hell?
[307:20.90]Alright, I'm just going to leave.
[307:25.16]Can I just leave?
[307:29.98]Putting course on screen.
[307:33.03]We are on course for our most difficult mission yet.
[307:36.54]Triplets.
[307:37.82]Keep the time shuttle open for emergencies while I figure out how we tackle this.
[307:42.46]Wait, what?
[307:42.98]Most dangerous birthday.
[307:45.70]Whatever.
[307:46.56]Issuing time card for embarrassing idol.
[307:49.13]Oh, shit.
[307:49.47]The final time card.
[307:51.15]Go, go, go.
[307:51.57]Quick.

[309:07.02]Here's your recording contract.
[309:08.40]Spin bottom records.
[309:10.65]It's like a dream come true.
[309:12.59]Specs, I'll get you for this if it's the last thing I do.
[309:17.39]Right after I get back from Mount Rushmore.
[309:20.63]Rushmore?
[309:21.69]I'd better go after him.
[309:23.51]I just remembered.
[309:24.41]I have to feed my goldfish.
[309:26.87]Are we still taping?
[309:29.40]That's our cue, little buddy.
[309:31.94]Don't forget to feed your goldfish.
[309:36.64]Have a time.
[309:37.14]Have a day.
[309:37.58]Every day.
[309:38.26]Have the time.
[309:40.54]Do it routine.
[309:41.22]You don't just do it whenever.
[309:42.24]Um...
[309:57.27]Congratulations on your recent embarrassing idol victory.
[310:00.07]Now hand over that contract.
[310:02.05]No chance.
[310:02.85]We need it.
[310:03.73]But that's supposed to be my contract.
[310:06.11]I want it fair and square.
[310:08.17]And I helped him cheat.
[310:09.89]Forget it, clones.
[310:11.25]That contract is ours.
[310:12.83]Now take a hike.
[310:15.85]Beware Santa Claus.
[310:18.37]And Mr. Spatula.
[310:19.61]And you, Bliss.
[310:20.65]No, you just ruined the game.
[310:22.11]This could take a while.
[310:24.79]Nonsense.
[310:26.19]Yeah, all those guys are our friends.
[310:29.39]You just did the thing.
[310:30.09]You just told me all the answers.
[310:33.43]Got any questions about your immediate future?
[310:36.30]Nope, can't think of any.
[310:37.64]What number am I thinking of right now?
[310:40.68]28.
[310:41.42]That's all?
[310:42.66]There's nothing you're curious about?
[310:44.62]We'd rather see it for ourselves.
[310:46.68]Keeps the mystery in our relationship.
[310:49.78]Okay, well.
[310:50.94]We just came to say hello.
[310:52.80]Somebody's got trouble letting go of the past.
[310:56.82]I'll be glad when I grow out of that attitude problem.
[310:59.68]Alright, well, hello.
[311:01.74]Okay, that's done.
[311:03.92]Let's get back to our time machine, Max.
[311:05.95]Yeah, I've seen more than enough of this place for one lifetime.
[311:09.61]Time machine?
[311:10.75]Cool.
[311:11.31]Wait a minute.
[311:13.71]We're two, little buddy.
[311:15.01]Just hit random buttons.
[311:21.12]Just let him go in?
[311:23.12]What?
[311:33.78]Oh boy!
[311:34.61]In the future, we've got our own spaceship!
[311:37.07]And our own industrious and no doubt completely legally hired crew.
[311:41.35]Incoming delivery.
[311:42.95]Entrega entrante.
[311:45.57]You jerks!
[311:48.25]You may as well go through the last year and a half all over again.
[311:50.78]Stand aside, decadent future versions of ourselves.
[311:54.96]Yeah, we've got a very important case to solve here.
[311:57.74]They had to do it all again.
[312:00.80]So wait, what the hell are we all doing here?
[312:08.40]I want to ask you something.
[312:09.94]Hey pal, I'll ask the questions here.
[312:11.80]This is freaking me out.
[312:15.84]What is he waiting for?
[312:17.96]Be patient, Max.
[312:19.23]It takes a while to think up the right thing to say.
[312:21.93]Max and I have to get to the moon.
[312:23.45]How do we get there?
[312:24.09]You have to get to the moon?
[312:27.76]You drive to the moon.
[312:29.34]Yeah, you just drive.
[312:30.00]You need a toaster with wings.
[312:32.00]You need to go ask Stinky in early 80s.
[312:59.46]No, you need to... Just room your way there.
[313:06.68]No, you need to go to... Super Bowl?
[313:10.36]No... Super Bowl, yes.
[313:12.67]Ask Agent Super Bowl in the future.
[313:18.61]Well, there's two hours we're never getting back.
[313:21.09]Just between you and me, pal, I don't think those future versions of us know what they're doing.
[313:27.03]Hey, buddy.
[313:27.47]Hey, buddy.
[313:28.13]I've got a question.
[313:29.59]Ask away.
[313:30.69]How can we get to the moon?
[313:31.55]How do we get to the moon?
[313:33.93]You, uh... Take a really big trampoline?
[313:41.91]You need a really big trampoline.
[313:43.82]Alright.
[313:44.62]Where do we get one of those?
[313:47.56]Oh, there was a way.
[313:48.04]Was there a down arrow?
[313:50.78]Ask Mama Bosco in the city...
[313:56.51]Hey, come here.
[314:02.71]How do you get to the moon?
[314:06.51]Okay.
[314:07.77]Holy shit, there's a lot.
[314:08.69]Alright, the heart.
[314:09.75]You need the heart of a champion.
[314:10.91]You need 20 pound can of beans.
[314:12.25]You need a time-traveling phone booth.
[314:19.56]How do you get to the moon?
[314:21.76]How did we get to the moon?
[314:25.22]You need a time-traveling phone booth.
[314:27.12]Alright.
[314:27.88]Where do we get one of those?
[314:28.50]Didn't we just drive?
[314:41.93]Ask Agent Superball in the future.
[314:47.17]What is this place?
[314:49.35]This is not our beautiful house.
[314:53.68]Yeah, because he does like the men in black thing where he... How do we fix this?
[315:01.37]You just drive.
[315:02.69]You drive.
[315:27.64]You need a screwdriver.
[315:32.22]You need a screwdriver.
[315:33.62]Alright.
[315:34.30]Where do we get one of those?
[315:39.13]You gotta go to Stinkies in the 80s for that.
[315:46.10]You got one.
[315:47.58]We'll trade you for a recording contract.
[315:49.73]Hey, Sam, don't we have a recording contract?
[315:52.55]Yeah, but we need it for... I can't remember.
[315:56.73]Stankies.
[315:58.38]Stankies.
[315:59.20]Did I say stankies?
[316:00.74]No, I didn't.
[316:01.82]I said stankies.
[316:03.02]I guess so.
[316:04.30]Along with that carton of missile pops you promised.
[316:07.38]Don't push it, Max.
[316:09.33]Alright.
[316:10.83]Here you go.
[316:12.25]Well done, Sam and Max.
[316:13.89]That was the last of your quests.
[316:16.02]You have scored 234 out of a possible 500 points!
[316:20.50]Weren't you gonna trade us something?
[316:22.26]Uh, yeah.
[316:23.30]Here's that screwdriver you guys wanted.
[316:25.34]Goodbye!
[316:26.30]We'll never forget all you've done here today!
[316:28.80]Have fun on the rest of your adventures!
[316:31.66]I'm even more confused than usual.
[316:35.55]So then, now... Look what I got.
[316:39.99]I've got something here.
[316:41.91]Do you see what's in my hand?

[316:46.18]Your ticket to musical stardom.
[316:47.71]My very own recording contract.

[324:53.39]The mariachis use it to listen across time and space.
[324:56.49]So there's only one more.
[325:02.44]Even in the future, they get reruns.
[325:04.78]So how do I get this guy to leave?

[331:07.38]I'm throwing the egg in the Bermuda Triangle.
[331:09.94]Right after the volcano erupted.
[331:13.62]Obviously, it was a signal flare for the Carvers to come get us.
[331:17.68]See, we're not so good with the direction.
[331:26.85]Throw the egg.
[331:28.09]Come on.

[331:46.00]Must be nice finally getting out of that dirt after a thousand years.
[331:51.86]He's been buried all that time?
[331:54.16]That's so sad.
[331:55.86]It's shrinking.
[331:57.94]Funny seeing you guys here again.
[331:59.27]If there's nothing funny about it, it's what we were carved to do.
[332:03.61]Hey, lighten up on Sam and Matt.
[332:05.69]Oh, you're one to talk, Mr. One offensive stereotype after the next.
[332:09.91]Now you're just being mean.
[332:12.21]They're shrinking him.
[332:15.25]He's got like a... There's like a zebra up here.
[332:17.05]It may look like a zebra, but my Mexican... The bridge doesn't do anything.
[332:21.73]Attempt to enter soul-crushing area.
[332:24.42]Please acknowledge.
[332:26.02]Override in San Pedro.
[332:28.42]Voice print match.
[332:29.86]Voice print match.
[332:30.70]Do I need the... What about that bug that can talk?
[332:41.10]I gotta get this down.
[332:44.86]How do I get it down?
[332:45.72]I can't shoot it.
[332:50.52]It's steel.
[332:51.38]How do I get it down?
[332:52.30]I can't shoot it.
[333:01.47]I can't shoot anything.
[333:04.27]I can't, like, drop a string.
[333:21.26]they are focusing the camera on that thing so many times appears to be made of the finest leather from only the finest and mutilated cattle still haven't figured out what to do with the cork
[333:43.77]Let's go back here.
[333:44.93]I haven't been here in a while.
[333:58.78]What can I get from here?
[333:59.82]Anything?
[334:03.06]See, I thought they were like frogs or something.
[334:06.12]See?
[334:06.38]That's what I was talking about.
[334:15.68]What's that do?
[334:16.24]What's that do?
[334:16.90]What did that do?
[334:17.62]What's this do?
[334:18.44]What does that do?
[334:19.42]What did I just do?
[334:20.34]What did I do?
[334:21.00]Wait a minute.
[334:26.82]What did I do?
[334:57.96]What happened?
[335:05.71]It's Bosco's model volcano.
[335:07.37]Safely sealed up.
[335:08.17]It's sealed up.
[335:09.57]It's just sealed up.
[335:11.97]What?
[335:12.93]Looks like our trusty bulletin board is still in good shape.
[335:16.07]What?
[335:16.51]Somebody died?
[335:17.53]Local mariachi Pedro died this week due to complications from inhaling ink ribbon fumes.
[335:24.33]What a waste.
[335:25.87]wait wait wait wait wait wait that's how I get him out of the room not much use for this anymore I say you're gonna get ink poisoning so long alright let's go warn him he's gonna wait we got it game over
[335:56.85]It's one of his questions?
[335:59.05]Yeah, I don't know.
[336:00.53]I had to bring him his own obituary.
[336:02.69]It was like a little thing on the bulletin board.
[336:16.36]Yeah, so what was the purpose of the ink ribbon last episode?
[336:22.01]Good news, senor.
[336:23.25]We found the gruesome details of your horrible demise.
[336:27.69]Oy, what a stupid way to die.
[336:29.87]Uh, I can think of stupider ways.
[336:32.33]And I could help!
[336:33.65]Kind of makes you want to quit your job, huh?
[336:35.68]Oh, no.
[336:36.54]There are still so many big questions I want to answer.
[336:39.62]No, the egg thing again.
[336:40.52]Fucking Jesus.
[336:40.96]But screw that stupid printer.
[336:44.50]Oh, no.
[336:44.84]He doesn't care about the printer.
[336:45.60]Good.
[336:49.35]Nobody's gonna need this worthless ink remedy.
[336:51.03]Okay, there's the ink.
[336:54.17]Hey, you can't just throw litter into the time vortex.
[336:58.71]Yeah, Sam.
[336:59.81]Somewhere a time-traveling Native American is crying.
[337:03.15]Where did it land?
[337:04.29]At the rate we're going, last month at the castle in Germany.
[337:11.01]Oh.
[337:16.05]Okay.
[337:17.92]Nothing doing it.
[337:19.35]Well, there you go.
[337:21.29]I was just talking about how useless that item was, wasn't I?
[337:24.88]Well, okay.
[337:26.02]Timing, I guess.
[337:32.72]So now... We'd like to get a time card, please.
[337:39.93]Issuing time card for embarrassing idol.
[337:43.01]It's blank.
[337:46.37]So long.
[337:46.91]Get lost.
[337:50.41]Blank time card.
[337:51.87]What does this do?
[337:52.68]Can I put it as anything?
[338:03.56]Uh... What does it...
[338:19.66]What the hell?
[338:20.22]Don't touch it.
[338:20.88]What?
[338:49.77]That's the singularity from which the entire universe is going to spring in a mind-bendingly tremendous cataclysm.
[338:57.22]Oh, the chicken is here.
[338:58.62]The chicken came first.
[339:00.44]We need proof.
[339:01.00]Mr. Featherly?
[339:02.60]Sam and Max?
[339:06.49]Are you really the oldest living creature in existence?
[339:09.97]Or are you the last of a race of terrifying elder gods bent on restoring chaos to our upstart universe?
[339:16.13]Neither.
[339:16.95]I assure you I arrived here quite by accident.
[339:22.73]How do you like it here around the singularity?
[339:25.17]I thought dinner theater in Ocala, Florida was dull, but that was nothing compared to our nothing.
[339:37.08]Being here at the start of it all can't be all bad.
[339:39.58]Well, I will give it one thing.
[339:41.51]The acoustics are outstanding!
[339:44.15]Ho ho!
[339:49.08]How'd you get here?
[339:50.06]I was filming the climactic volcanic eruption scene in Midtown Cowboy's The Motion Picture.
[339:56.02]Suddenly, I found myself abducted onto some type of alien spacecraft.
[340:01.32]After a frightfully amateurish song and dance number, I was deposited unceremoniously into the beginning of the universe.
[340:09.13]Oh, that old story.
[340:12.51]the midtown cowboys wait wait wait there's a midtown cowboys movie uh yes well I'm sure we were going to call you but we decided to go in a different direction oh we have got to get a new agent sam
[340:28.52]Why don't you come with us, Mr. Featherly?
[340:30.52]I'm sorry.
[340:31.66]I can't let you do that, Salmon Max.
[340:34.38]That chicken is the source of all life in the universe.
[340:37.80]Can we at least take a photo?
[340:38.54]Removing him would cause a catastrophic temporal paradox.
[340:43.08]Catastrophic temporal paradox?
[340:46.18]Mr. Featherly's not the only chicken around here.
[340:50.23]Apparently I am.
[340:51.97]And there's the rub.
[340:53.29]Oh, that's so cool.
[340:54.20]That's a wicked awesome reference.
[340:55.44]That's to Star Fox.
[340:57.06]Can't let you do that, Star Fox.
[340:59.00]That's so awesome.
[341:00.86]Come back to existence with us, Mr. F. It appears I cannot leave without violating the laws of the universe.
[341:07.94]You'll have to find a stand-in.
[341:13.57]See you around, Mr. Featherly.
[341:15.15]Probably not, Sam, since he'll be long dead.
[341:18.99]That's from 2001, Space Odyssey!
[341:22.34]Strangle him!
[341:23.52]Strangle him!
[341:29.16]You've been doing a good job, Mr. Featherly, but we decided to cast someone younger.
[341:33.68]Very well.
[341:34.56]As long as I can leave this accursed... Wait, what are you doing?
[341:38.63]Put me down at once!
[341:41.03]Suck it up, Featherly.
[341:42.27]It only takes a day or two to get used to Sam's caustic B.O.
[341:45.91]Curse you, Max and Sam!
[341:49.37]Okay, so the egg is just there.
[341:56.28]So now let me prove that this egg is real.
[341:59.32]Wait, don't I throw the egg?
[342:00.40]Let me prove that the chicken is the first... thing?
[342:08.74]How is this gonna prove it though?
[342:13.67]So the egg did come first.
[342:15.21]But the egg is the first thing.
[342:17.05]So why would I bring the chicken there?
[342:32.34]He's just with us?
[342:32.99]He's just with us right now.
[342:36.85]Okay, well.
[342:37.71]Can we do this?
[342:38.97]Hey, look.
[343:00.05]Dear God, man, do you ever wash that coat?
[343:05.56]He's from before time began.
[343:07.60]Yeah, turns out the chicken came first.
[343:10.51]Hmm, it makes no sense.
[343:12.63]If that's the chicken, what's there now?
[343:15.49]Well, we left an egg.
[343:17.89]Likely story.
[343:19.42]I'll have to exceed that egg.
[343:21.86]But, but, but... I'm just kidding.
[343:24.50]Boy, you past people are so gullible.
[343:27.06]Wait, wait, wait!
[343:28.78]No!
[343:29.42]Don't put me back in there!
[343:31.52]Any more questions about the nature of our existence?
[343:34.80]No, the chicken was the big one.
[343:37.16]Vaya con Dios, Maxi-Sam.
[343:39.80]Woohoo!
[343:40.70]Now the spaceship is ours to command.
[343:43.40]Ensign Sam, set course for ancient Rome.
[343:46.72]Our mission?
[343:47.60]To hug Caligula.
[343:49.46]Stop goofing off, Max.
[343:50.94]We've got to extend that bridge and return Bosco's soul.
[343:53.98]What's happening?
[343:55.46]I don't want to go!
[343:57.52]Oh no, he's through.
[343:59.20]Whoops.
[344:00.12]Great.
[344:00.92]Now we'll have to figure out how to get all up in there.
[344:05.78]You stopping time?
[344:09.65]Oh yeah?
[344:10.09]You sure about that?
[344:11.13]Slow it down with the molasses.
[344:35.35]Alright.
[344:35.77]Now... Time is now frozen.
[344:37.05]Can I turn... I can turn this on.
[344:38.83]Let's turn this on.
[345:02.77]Attempt to enter soul-crushing area.
[345:05.57]Please acknowledge.
[345:06.55]But if time was frozen... Just make with the bridge already.
[345:10.24]Alright, alright.
[345:11.68]How would this be happening?
[345:13.94]This wouldn't be able to move.
[345:14.80]Hola, Sam and Max.
[345:19.24]You don't know us, but we are time-traveling mariachis.
[345:23.41]With a warning from the future.
[345:26.97]Whatever you do, do not extend that bridge.
[345:30.61]Bridge extended.
[345:31.81]Uh-oh.
[345:32.99]Foreign body in time vortex.
[345:35.50]Self-destruct sequence engaged.
[345:37.90]Madre de Dios.
[345:39.10]Let's get out of here.
[345:40.54]It dumped him over there.
[345:41.48]We could cover some more birthdays.
[345:43.12]Okay, Pedro, you take the bog in the diner.
[345:46.27]Pedro, you take the statue-loving lady on Easter Island.
[345:50.39]I'll take the monster.
[345:52.13]Oh, yeah.
[345:52.99]Good luck, Maxi-san.
[345:56.42]So now we have to get up.
[346:01.10]Oh, that's the ship.
[346:04.08]SETTING COURSE FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE.
[346:10.51]TOTAL DESTRUCTION IMMINENT.
[346:12.61]PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.
[346:13.97]Evacuate.
[346:15.11]So, Sam, is now a good time to start pulling my hair out and wetting myself in panic?
[346:19.97]I'm not going to save the game.
[346:20.79]Knock yourself out, Hal.
[346:21.37]Better hurry, though.
[346:22.85]Nose!
[346:23.57]It's a rat movie.
[346:26.40]Okay.
[346:30.47]We gotta get out.
[346:35.45]You can't, like, suck them through?
[346:41.11]Okay, you can only go halfway.
[346:43.51]Can I speed up time or something?
[346:54.92]So I say no, I'm not going to start an earthquake, and he's all... Whatever, and I'm all, what does that mean?
[347:07.13]Well, that's the kind of fun that doesn't last.
[347:09.57]Okay, so this is not strong.
[347:11.85]Oof.
[347:17.12]What do I have?
[347:17.98]I got... A little AI.
[347:28.29]Can I do the tar again?
[347:29.21]Will this help at all?
[347:47.38]Oops.
[347:47.78]So I could do suck?
[347:49.64]Okay, so get him up there, and then freeze, and then suck again?
[347:59.10]It won't do anything.
[348:07.17]Well, I kind of have to wait.
[348:08.07]What if I just walk over here?
[348:10.87]Okay, here we go.
[348:12.75]So, suck him up.
[348:13.67]Freeze.
[348:14.21]Suck him up.
[348:33.38]So I say, no, I'm not going to start an earthquake and freeze everything.
[348:39.99]So then I can't do it again.
[348:40.99]It's already sucking.
[348:58.15]Can I go over there?
[348:59.03]No, it's going to unfreeze.
[349:08.17]I don't think I can get over there.
[349:09.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[349:14.02]What just happened?
[349:14.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[349:15.08]Hold on a second.
[349:16.68]I can get over there.
[349:17.38]Let me see what happens.
[349:37.77]So I... Yeah, okay.
[349:49.14]Approaching beginning of the universe.
[349:51.40]Destruction imminent.
[349:53.10]Go, little buddy.
[349:53.96]It's now or never.
[349:55.22]Where do you think this point goes?
[349:57.16]Anywhere that's not on a spaceship set to self-destruct and hurtling towards the beginning of the universe.
[350:02.07]Alright, Sam.
[350:02.85]If this doesn't work, I'll see you in hell!
[350:06.05]What about Bosco?
[350:09.81]Okay, so you can't just leave Bosco out there.
[350:11.43]That's bullshit.
[350:19.79]Tarots of the Dogs.
[350:34.38]I think it's, um... Somebody said there's an after-credits thing?
[350:38.39]Well, wait.
[350:43.62]We've got a huge cliffhanger.
[350:48.16]Yeah, they have to... What about the egg?
[351:02.64]You got the bad ending.
[351:05.46]It's real quiet in here.
[351:08.60]It's fucking quiet in here, man.
[351:18.35]Uh-oh.
[351:20.39]So, um, I, uh... What did you guys do this weekend?
[351:28.54]Did you do anything?
[351:33.10]I guess.
[351:35.72]Moan really loud.
[351:36.92]No.
[351:46.89]I watched this guy stream.
[351:48.09]His name is Jerma985.
[351:58.90]Why would I read that?
[352:00.42]I don't know.
[352:01.86]Why the hell would I?
[352:05.04]There's no reason on Earth.
[352:07.83]That was fun, though.
[352:08.41]That was a... I like time travel shit.
[352:11.73]It's interesting.
[352:13.44]It's fun how people do time travel stuff and they try to make it work.
[352:21.17]Alright, let's see.
[352:42.52]You hit the singularity!
[352:43.46]Uh-oh.
[352:44.16]That's not good.
[352:46.30]Get off your phone!
[352:47.28]I was just checking the... I was just checking the time.
[352:51.91]Wait.
[352:53.63]What happened?
[353:04.48]Did the game crash?
[353:06.00]No, the game... Yeah, it crashed when I hit the... Huh?
[353:11.10]No.
[353:14.70]your phone it's the end of the movie the credits are rolling people like at the very end of the movie the credits roll people start getting up they pick they take their phones up they haven't looked at it in like three four hours did I actually miss something like the game just the game actually crashed no I didn't miss anything
[353:49.36]You leave before the credits scene?
[353:51.36]No, I don't.
[353:52.44]I just like, people start stretching, they start moving around.
[354:03.06]Don't be that guy.
[354:03.78]The movie's over!
[354:05.79]The credits roll and people are getting up from their seats and making sure they have all their stuff.
[354:12.61]Sorry, I'm ruining you reading the guy's names?
[354:21.84]Not the people getting up, standing up, going, oh, that, whoa, that was fucking awesome.
[354:27.57]Did you, I loved that part when he, yeah, when he flew.
[354:30.09]No, that was awesome.
[354:30.99]Yeah, me too.
[354:31.89]Are you hungry?
[354:34.25]No, but me taking my phone up and looking at it for a second is bad.
[354:45.16]At the end of the movie where the credits are rolling on the screen.
[354:49.89]What has gotten into you?
[354:51.35]What's gotten into you all?
[354:55.13]Jokes aside, did I actually really... Did I actually miss something at the end because the game crashed?
[355:00.70]Or is that supposed to happen?
[355:05.98]Okay, so where's our loading screen here?
[355:16.12]What happened to all my saves?
[355:32.33]You missed the quick time event.
[355:37.72]No, I didn't.
[355:44.16]But yes, but there is something.
[355:47.24]Am I getting, I'm just being lied to?
[355:48.84]Alright, well then, why are you doing this?
[355:51.12]Everyone said I missed something because the game crashed.
[355:55.04]I just ask if there's anything after the credits, because the client literally closed.
[356:00.54]The client closed.
[356:01.46]It, like, broke.
[356:12.36]That was the joke.
[356:14.18]Yeah, I don't know, but, like, Twitch chat's like, You idiot!
[356:16.32]You missed it!
[356:17.02]You're crazy!
[356:17.76]You're stupid!
[356:18.54]Oh, I have to check.
[356:30.44]Go crazy.
[356:31.30]Go stupid.
[356:32.04]Alright, that's gonna be it for tonight.
[356:36.03]That's a solid place to stop, I think.
[356:44.16]That's a major cliffhanger for the next time.
[356:59.01]And those of you that are saying, oh, there's only one episode left, just do it now.
[357:03.13]Well, I've kind of had this way to do it.
[357:08.81]And if you think about it, it's actually a pretty good idea.
[357:11.71]Because I don't ever play just one episode like of Sam and Max.
[357:18.24]Leaving one episode means that I'm going to start the other season.
[357:23.64]If I were to do it now, maybe I could just be like, oh, that shit, Shamimax season 3, I'll do it in a few weeks.
[357:28.86]You know what I mean?
[357:32.58]Doesn't that kind of make it so we do the third season?
[357:36.99]Because I wouldn't just do one episode.
[357:38.81]I don't know, you know?
[357:54.85]He's bribing us.
[357:56.13]No, six hours is a good stream because then we'll do the bits and everything gets to like, you know, seven hours.
[358:03.48]Just about.
[358:08.32]I'll be live tomorrow.
[358:09.10]Don't worry.
[358:15.41]Because another episode will take us to like a nine hour stream and I don't have the energy for like nine plus straight hours.
[358:23.21]Not today.
[358:23.57]Okay.
[358:30.21]Because each episode takes us about two and a half to three hours.
[358:33.48]Because, you know, we talk about stuff, we'll stop, we'll go off on, you know, talking about things, doing things.
[358:40.96]I don't think I have it in me for like a ten hour stream right now.
[358:55.73]But, I'll see you tomorrow.
[358:57.37]We're going to play...
[359:01.36]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is the plan.
[359:08.64]So that should be really fun.
[359:09.58]I'm really looking forward to that.
[359:18.64]I think this... I'm going to give you a prediction here.
[359:20.94]I think the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 streams tomorrow are going to be
[359:28.21]I think a lot of material available in here.
[359:32.01]I think some of your favorite characters of the year might show up here.
[359:34.79]I'm just throwing that out there.
[359:36.59]It's possible.
[359:40.95]There are so many weird characters and weird creatures in these games.
[359:44.71]You're going to get attached to one of them.
[359:47.33]No, I'm not going to do any multiplayer.
[359:51.62]Single player.
[359:53.38]Single player.
[360:00.25]Can you even do multiplayer in the original Might and Magic 3?
[360:03.23]Don't you have to play that over a LAN?
[360:08.74]I don't think so.
[360:10.40]But it should be a lot of fun.
[360:11.32]We're just on a black screen right now.
[360:12.36]We shouldn't be.
[360:14.42]Another really, really good important thing here.
[360:20.16]The internet didn't drop out at all, really.
[360:22.62]It dropped 600 frames in 6 hours.
[360:26.40]That's really, really good.
[360:29.08]Hopefully we can pray to the internet gods that this is gonna work.
[360:36.48]And, um... Another thing I wanted to ask, so... Heroes of Might and Magic 3 had a remake.
[360:44.69]And apparently it's kind of not good.
[360:53.34]Let me see.
[360:54.08]Is it on Steam?
[360:56.14]Or is it on Good Old Games?
[360:58.26]Yeah, it's on Steam.
[360:59.86]Here's a My Magic 3 HD Edition.
[361:03.80]Am I crazy to say that I shouldn't get this?
[361:08.68]Because this version is bad.
[361:11.00]And, like, fucked up.
[361:18.67]Just get the one from GOG.
[361:26.48]The GOG one is actually better.
[361:28.04]Okay.
[361:28.50]Yeah, I'll just get it from GOG.
[361:33.43]Doesn't have any of the expansions or anything either.
[361:35.91]What resolution does it run in, I wonder?
[361:49.10]Because it is a very old game.
[361:53.59]But I'll just get it from GOG.
[361:56.42]I haven't played this in a long time, and I love this game.
[362:04.56]We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[362:05.92]I'm looking forward to it.
[362:06.62]Should be a lot of fun.
[362:08.26]But, Sam and Max, I will complete Season 2.
[362:10.80]And we'll move on to Season 3.
[362:12.40]I don't see why we wouldn't just do them.
[362:15.41]At least just do all three seasons.
[362:17.75]I don't know if I'm gonna do the other ones.
[362:20.52]I know people are like, oh, there's all this one.
[362:21.90]There's like Hit the Road.
[362:23.14]There's Sam & Max Go to Hell.
[362:25.98]There's Sam & Max.
[362:27.32]I'm not sure if I'm gonna do them all.
[362:30.68]I at least want to get through like the three seasons of the original Sam & Max.
[362:38.74]and then take it from there.
[362:40.06]I also don't want to, like, overdo it where Sam and Max is, like, every single week.
[362:46.60]You know?
[362:46.94]I feel like people would start to get exhausted of Sam and Max's... Half the streams are Sam and Max at that point.
[362:54.28]I feel like people would just be like, uh, can you do anything else?
[363:05.05]So, I don't want to, like, exhaust it and have people not want to see it.
[363:08.65]So, we'll see.
[363:13.98]But anyways, we're going to do the bits and the subs and everything, so... Thanks for watching, everybody.
[363:19.80]See you tomorrow.
[363:21.74]That was CMAX.
[363:22.90]That time travel episode was great.
[363:25.66]Hit a lot of notes for me.
[363:28.24]It was, like, really funny, too.
[363:29.70]Like, the first, like, hour of that game was, like, fucking really funny.
[363:42.10]So, I think that was a good one.
[363:45.22]It was very good.
[363:49.53]But six hours ago,
[363:54.52]We had, uh, $2... Oh, by the way, starting at the regular time tomorrow.
[363:58.68]I just had, um, some stuff I had to get done today.
[364:03.25]So I wasn't really... I couldn't start at, like, between 3 and 4.
[364:06.23]I had to go at, like, 4.15, 4.20 or something.
[364:09.29]But tomorrow, it'll start normal.
[364:11.83]Probably, like, you know, in that 3 to 4, like, 3.30-ish kind of range.
[364:15.43]I won't be starting late tomorrow.
[364:16.71]There's no reason why I would be.
[364:19.79]So, normal time tomorrow.
[364:22.13]But thank you, InvaderZ, for the $2.55!
[364:25.51]Just wanted to thank you because you always cheer me up when I'm down, even if I only am able to watch pre-recorded stuff.
[364:32.13]Thank you, Jermo, really.
[364:33.04]Wait, didn't I already... I did this... Why is this showing up from today?
[364:36.48]That was from a few days ago.
[364:40.94]That's weird.
[364:42.06]Well, thank you.
[364:42.58]Thank you for that.
[364:44.02]From a few days ago, too.
[364:46.23]Mr. Comcast, thanks for the three bucks.
[364:50.39]I wrote you an end of stream song, no instrumentals though.
[364:54.37]Sorry, here it is.
[364:55.98]So it's the end of the stream, I hope you had fun.
[364:58.82]Laughs and goofs, we sure had a ton.
[365:00.80]But now it's time for the bits we will read.
[365:03.76]I need you all to behave.
[365:06.66]Your silence I will need.
[365:08.68]So snuggle up in bed and turn off your nightlight.
[365:11.30]There's no Kim in my closet, I checked, it's alright.
[365:14.10]For those of you leaving, I think you are lame.
[365:16.32]Watch tomorrow's stream because we're playing a porn game.
[365:31.56]That's pretty good.
[365:32.20]Pretty good.
[365:32.54]I like it.
[365:33.18]I like it.
[365:37.32]Thank you for the three dolls.
[365:38.14]Thank you, some guy, for the five dolls.
[365:40.65]So much for my sleep rhythm, which I'm a Pluto.
[365:43.81]Anyways, here's a meme video.
[365:47.53]Sometimes you just have to take a risk.
[365:48.91]What are you doing?
[365:52.51]Sometimes, princess...
[365:55.25]I don't understand why this is here.
[365:57.11]Why is the green goblin come out here?
[366:32.99]You want me to put it on screen?
[366:34.25]Alright, well, let's break this one down.
[366:36.61]Wait, this is Disney footage.
[366:38.65]Nah, I'll go to jail for, like, the rest of my life.
[366:42.13]Mm-mm.
[366:43.99]Yeah, what's going on with the screen?
[366:49.55]Why is this... This is, like, 4,000 by, like, 880.
[366:52.66]Why is it doing this?
[367:06.87]What is this resolution?
[367:14.96]Feed your guild members and stream legends?
[367:16.70]I'll feed you, don't worry.
[367:18.44]We'll do it at the very end.
[367:20.16]Actually, no, I'll do it now.
[367:21.60]That's Nightbot was telling me that.
[367:24.18]Nightbot, stop.
[367:28.06]I've reacted to that before too.
[367:31.49]Somebody said, please feed you guys.
[367:32.61]I was like, I will.
[367:33.37]I got to remember to do that.
[367:34.73]That was also Nightbot.
[367:36.47]I thought that was somebody in chat saying that.
[367:40.44]You do the command.
[367:41.48]That's fucking funny.
[367:47.45]But thank you, Dorkube, for the 250.
[367:48.77]Yeah.
[367:48.89]I'm still contemplating whether or not I might go to E3 this year.
[367:51.39]I'm not sure.
[368:10.93]It depends on a few factors.
[368:19.37]But.
[368:20.67]We'll see.
[368:22.35]It depends on a couple of things.
[368:24.09]Thank you Dorky for the 250.
[368:25.45]And congrats on that new job.
[368:32.60]I always love the streams where we can just do whatever.
[368:36.02]They're like so much fun to me.
[368:41.94]Thank you for the $2.50.
[368:44.69]Thank you, Saucy Bird, for the $2.50.
[368:46.77]Appreciate your streams a lot.
[368:48.85]Can you do a Larry David impression?
[368:50.45]Okay.
[368:53.17]What are you doing?
[368:54.11]No, hold on.
[368:54.75]What are you doing?
[368:57.89]There you go.
[369:11.38]Thank you for the 250.
[369:11.90]That's old man Adam Sandler.
[369:19.10]I actually could do Larry David, but I'm like... I'm a little winded for some reason.
[369:29.09]That sounded like Seinfeld.
[369:30.19]Well, they both worked very closely together.
[369:32.23]A lot of Seinfeld's humor actually is Larry David.
[369:38.57]Not sure how many of you guys know that.
[369:46.73]You learn something every day.
[369:48.59]Go watch Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[369:49.77]It's the best show.
[369:51.07]It's like the top two best shows on television that are comedies.
[369:57.53]Everyone knows that?
[369:58.25]There's at least five people here that didn't.
[370:06.74]What's number one?
[370:07.40]It's impossible.
[370:08.16]I can't tell you.
[370:09.58]It's like top three, top two.
[370:14.54]I wouldn't be able to give you a number one.
[370:17.77]Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[370:18.71]That's up there.
[370:19.65]Yep.
[370:19.77]That's in the top two.
[370:29.87]That's Curb Your Enthusiasm and Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[370:31.74]Those are the best two TV shows ever made that were like comedies.
[370:34.64]Yeah, that's my story.
[370:36.06]I'm sticking to it.
[370:41.53]South Park.
[370:42.03]Oh, shit.
[370:44.89]That's up there.
[370:45.55]That is.
[370:46.55]But no, I wouldn't say top two.
[370:58.67]I think South Park.
[371:01.63]Maybe South Park five, ten years ago.
[371:06.70]I really, really liked.
[371:07.52]I was super into it.
[371:11.54]I haven't really watched much of the newer seasons.
[371:16.28]But I would have to argue that the first... Yeah, somebody just said the first 10 years.
[371:23.92]VRJosh.
[371:24.36]Yeah, the first 10 seasons of South Park were really great.
[371:26.54]They were awesome.
[371:27.04]Are we talking about cartoons?
[371:33.22]No, I think just in general.
[371:37.98]The new seasons were great.
[371:38.99]I just haven't seen them.
[371:41.17]I've seen a few episodes from the... I've like scattered them around.
[371:45.91]Of the last three seasons or four seasons, I've probably seen maybe six or seven episodes.
[371:52.85]Yeah, these are like just favorite shows that are like comedies.
[371:58.14]I would say my favorite TV show ever made was Game of Thrones.
[372:03.66]I don't think I would say that anymore.
[372:06.88]Um, I'm not sure I would say that's the best show I've ever seen anymore.
[372:17.27]Breaking Bad is, like, up there for, like, just shows that are great that need to be watched.
[372:22.86]Okay, what?
[372:31.68]Why is everyone freaking out?
[372:36.84]Better Call Saul.
[372:37.60]I gotta see the newer seasons.
[372:39.90]I watched seasons 1 and seasons 2 of Better Call Saul.
[372:43.82]And I thought it was fantastic.
[372:45.26]I just didn't get the opportunity.
[372:46.62]I haven't had the time.
[372:48.89]Season 3 came out and I just didn't watch it.
[372:55.77]I want to, though.
[372:57.05]It's kind of on the list of never-ending TV shows.
[373:09.66]Did you enjoy Russell Peters or Dave Chappelle?
[373:12.70]Oh, I love Dave Chappelle.
[373:16.42]Dave Chappelle is fucking hysterical.
[373:18.26]His old TV show on Comedy Central is just... He's just a brilliant comedian.
[373:33.22]I do have to check out Chernobyl.
[373:34.54]That's true.
[373:35.18]I've heard it's insane.
[373:36.38]I've heard it's like the best show ever.
[373:38.50]I have to watch it.
[373:46.14]That's a lot of just good TV, huh?
[373:53.06]Talk about Chernobyl.
[373:54.36]The new HBO show.
[374:06.46]You're my favorite TV show.
[374:08.00]Wow!
[374:09.14]Thank you.
[374:10.94]That's so like... Thank you.
[374:20.67]Damn, that, like, I feel, like, great.
[374:24.70]What the heck?
[374:25.60]I feel fucking fantastic right now.
[374:30.82]Thank you, though.
[374:31.26]No, for real.
[374:32.32]That's... That's very touching.
[374:38.26]I'm blushing.
[374:42.80]But hey, thank you to...
[374:46.31]Uh, gnarly for the five dollars, here's five bucks, give me the straw.
[374:50.07]Nah, this thing would probably go for like a couple thousand.
[374:54.31]If I did it on camera, if off camera I said, hey, here's a straw that I put in my mouth, I don't think it would go for very much.
[375:01.01]On camera, if I like stuck it in there and I bit it and pulled it out, you'd have a document.
[375:05.28]And if I signed it, like if I did something to it so you knew it was the right one, you'd have a documented Twitch clip of me doing that and having the thing written on it, so you'd be able to prove it.
[375:15.71]It would be asset-backed.
[375:17.29]It would be an asset-backed clip.
[375:25.02]What time do you usually start streaming?
[375:29.00]I don't have a good day schedule.
[375:30.72]I just usually about three or four times a week.
[375:35.36]Starting between 3 and 4 p.m.
[375:38.38]Pacific.
[375:40.46]It just happens about four times a week.
[375:44.76]Today I was a little bit later, but I've been, the last like two weeks, I've been starting at like before 3.30.
[375:49.52]The last six or seven streams.
[375:57.23]At least the last two weeks I've started before like 3.30.
[376:05.75]It starts between 3 and 4 p.m.
[376:10.19]During that one hour window there.
[376:17.24]And the reason why that is a thing is having the one hour window makes it so if the stream happens after 4, it's like actually fucking late.
[376:27.44]I was actually, really, actually late today.
[376:32.37]But having that window means that I can't, because you guys have known this, you know, I've been streaming for like almost four, what, four, five fucking years now?
[376:40.77]Having a time, a hard time that's like 4 p.m.,
[376:45.53]That means like 4.15 every time.
[376:50.21]So, having that window of an hour is like, you can get in there.
[376:56.86]You can set it up, you can get your errands done, you can get your stuff for the day done and ready and then... Because essentially what happens is, you know, I'm here for six to eight hours, right?
[377:10.63]And... This... When I... Oh, I'm gonna take a pee.
[377:14.85]It's like two minutes.
[377:17.25]You know?
[377:18.25]So you kind of have to get all your shit done like for the day before you start.
[377:24.06]Because I'm here.
[377:25.50]It's been six and a half hours just about.
[377:28.34]And I went pee once.
[377:31.56]You know what I'm saying?
[377:32.36]So it's like it's... You kind of have to get all your shit like front-loaded.
[377:45.22]Because sometimes if you stream for like eight, you know, seven, eight, nine hours, which I think the average stream time of the stream is somewhere in like between like six and a half to like seven and a half.
[377:57.36]Usually it's like a seven plus-ish hour average for streams on this channel.
[378:04.86]So that's just, that's like seven hours of, I can't like go do, you know, I can't like, hey, I'll see you later.
[378:12.52]I'm gonna, I'm gonna go like do this.
[378:15.11]I'm gonna get, like, my tires rotated.
[378:16.69]I'll be back.
[378:25.38]You get to shit front loader for the morning bathroom visits.
[378:28.64]Well, that's another thing, like, going to the bathroom.
[378:31.77]Here's, like, a streamer insider thing when I'm, like, to make this more clear.
[378:37.85]If I'm here for eight hours straight...
[378:41.16]I don't, like, go to the bathroom.
[378:42.82]I can barely eat.
[378:44.54]So you have to, like, front-load everything and have everything done before you start streaming, because you know... You know, I'll go take, like, a piss and grab a water, but... I'm not gonna put, like, the Be Right Backup screen up for, like, 15 to 20, 30 minutes.
[379:05.53]You know?
[379:06.49]Because... Well, why not?
[379:07.91]Because people leave.
[379:13.59]If you hit that BRB button and you're gone for more than five minutes, ten minutes, people just will be like, yeah, whatever, see you later.
[379:24.77]You know, it's like kind of one of those things you have to juggle between, like, do you want to have, like, a good straight stream, or do you want to break it up, or... Some people do two streams a day, right?
[379:36.87]They stream for, like, three or four hours in the morning, and then, like, three or four hours at night.
[379:45.24]I think that... I'm pretty sure average stream time is not that long for most streams, isn't it?
[379:53.63]I'm thinking of most people that I know that stream.
[379:57.27]Like four to five hours is typical, usually.
[380:02.50]Like three, four, five hours max for a lot of streamers.
[380:07.86]Most are like three to four.
[380:17.39]Yeah, that sounds fun, yeah.
[380:20.33]But remember, I mean, I also only stream like three to four times a week.
[380:25.11]I don't stream every day.
[380:27.18]So if I stream for six, seven, eight hours at a stream and I do it four times a week, it kind of makes up for the fact that I don't do like a three to four hour stream five, six days a week.
[380:38.18]You know?
[380:41.01]All things to consider, right?
[380:44.15]But what the hell were we even talking about?
[380:53.58]Are we talking about front-loading shit?
[380:54.80]Yeah, yeah, I'm just... Because we're talking about errands and... Sometimes if, like, something comes up that I have to get done and I need to do... Like, that comes up in the day.
[381:06.71]It's like, oh, fuck, Will.
[381:11.42]Kind of have to do it.
[381:14.62]What was my longest stream?
[381:15.54]The Simpsons?
[381:16.04]I don't know.
[381:20.83]I don't know, 14 hours I think is the longest?
[381:23.41]13, 14 hours?
[381:28.43]Seaman was like 12.
[381:32.69]Lifeline was 12.
[381:33.65]How long was Clock Tower?
[381:34.55]10?
[381:35.08]9?
[381:41.18]I think Simpsons Hit and Run was 11.
[381:49.45]The PS2 voice game.
[381:53.01]I don't know how people... I know it's not a thing that people do that regularly, but streaming... Even streaming more than 8 to 10 hours in one stream, it's just, you get so... I get so, like, tired.
[382:06.68]Like, talking, you know, 10, 12 hours, you're like, I feel like I'm gonna bite, throat's gonna explode.
[382:12.47]I can't imagine, like, doing 10 plus hour streams...
[382:18.66]On a regular basis.
[382:20.42]Like, 12.
[382:21.04]It was 15 hours yesterday.
[382:23.08]I would turn to dust.
[382:29.53]Streaming that long worries me.
[382:33.51]Yeah.
[382:35.79]I've always been of the opinion... I mean, remember, I come from YouTube.
[382:38.59]I like...
[382:44.54]I don't like to do super long, long, long, long form content.
[382:53.60]And I don't think I'm even capable of doing it.
[383:01.62]I... I have these weird, extreme moments of super high energy, super low energy.
[383:08.54]So, if I do like a super high energy, you know, three, four hours, that gets just like, I'm alright.
[383:14.60]That was really fun.
[383:18.30]But I never want to get to that point where I'm like pressing more than I should or want to.
[383:24.71]You know, just for the sake of having like a six to ten hour stream, I can't do it.
[383:30.63]And I don't want to do that either.
[383:35.69]Because then it starts to become...
[383:40.38]It starts to become something that I'm making myself do because I feel like I have to.
[383:45.38]When I think the best streams that we do here in this community, the best streams that I've put on the channel are ones that I'm just doing what I want to do.
[383:55.34]You know, looking at the clock and it's like, oh, it's been like seven and a half hours.
[383:59.08]I really should probably keep going.
[384:00.52]I should keep going.
[384:01.72]And you get tired and it's just not as fun and you're not as... I've had that mentality for a while.
[384:12.79]Just do drugs Because I remember I want to try to give you guys the best that I know that I can try to do I think I owe that to you till I try to give you the best stream I can do because I want to have the most fun and do the most
[384:33.96]I don't want streams to turn into like phoned in, they have to be this certain length and they have to be this certain day and they have to be... Well, it's got to be like 10 hours, you have to.
[384:43.20]Because then it becomes that thing that is like, oh, I have to stream this long.
[384:53.09]And it kind of puts a wrench into everything that I like to do.
[385:08.05]Because the nature of, like, streaming and YouTube and... Is, you know, are you guys having fun?
[385:16.03]Do you guys think that things are interesting or entertaining?
[385:18.82]I can't, like, force myself to do that.
[385:25.28]I can't make myself, like, be entertaining.
[385:29.70]I can't make these streams fun.
[385:32.29]I have to have fun.
[385:38.10]You know what I'm saying?
[385:40.06]You guys know this.
[385:40.72]We talk about this every few weeks.
[385:43.81]We kind of bring up something about it.
[385:50.23]You can't push your stuff and streaming is no longer fun.
[385:51.89]Yeah, I know.
[385:52.45]That's... I don't want to do that.
[385:57.62]Even if it's, like, to the detriment of... Like... Don't know, my... Like... But what about, like, the money and the... And the clout and the... And the career and... No, I have to like doing this.
[386:10.30]I can't just, like, force myself to do it.
[386:16.32]I don't, like... I have to enjoy it.
[386:20.74]Otherwise, I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[386:23.36]Oh, the clout.
[386:23.94]I need that clout.
[386:27.17]No, I don't- I could care less.
[386:34.49]Just be a tuber!
[386:36.63]Oh, wow, what a mood as fuck!
[386:39.49]No, you guys get it.
[386:40.15]I just- I feel like sometimes I like to talk about it, because... I want you to like the streams.
[386:47.72]I want you to think this is a fun place.
[386:50.34]And I hope you guys say it is.
[386:54.92]Me forcing myself to do something is not going to be fun for anybody.
[387:01.10]For the sake of just being on camera longer or doing something in particular, it's not going to work that way.
[387:15.68]But yeah, don't be forced.
[387:18.61]Yeah, I think I take the necessary steps to make that a thing that I don't do.
[387:28.18]Stop being wholesome and start being funny.
[387:30.32]Yeah, I like the variety of the games.
[387:41.73]Well, that's just because I can't do the same thing.
[387:46.55]Over and over again, I can't.
[387:49.03]Team Fortress 2 was the last thing that I really was super into that I could do every day for years.
[387:59.18]Nothing else has come along that has done that since.
[388:06.14]And, I mean, maybe it is because I'm getting a little older.
[388:09.29]You know, I turned 34 this year.
[388:11.43]Maybe I'm getting a little bit older and my tastes are changing and... It's possible.
[388:18.77]You know what I'm saying?
[388:28.35]Streamers that hate what they're doing.
[388:30.87]Yeah, I don't want that to happen.
[388:33.67]Because then that's a detriment to your viewing experience.
[388:37.39]If I don't like what I'm doing, and I'm not having a good time when I'm doing it, and I'm just doing it because I think I have to, it's... That becomes that sort of weird dynamic where it's essentially like a routine.
[388:53.57]Just going through a routine, and I don't want that to happen here.
[388:57.83]You're really 34?
[388:58.35]Yeah, I turned 34 and, uh, date to be determined.
[389:02.67]Grandpa.
[389:20.85]No, I don't feel forced.
[389:22.09]I don't.
[389:23.47]I just want to give you my side of the coin here.
[389:27.65]But why some of these things are done a certain way.
[389:36.17]I do not feel forced at all.
[389:39.55]Do not worry about that.
[389:42.59]Just giving the reasoning behind why there's some things on this channel that are the way that they are and how they kind of just have to stay that way.
[389:55.63]But, we're almost through the bits here.
[389:57.63]We have a little bit longer to go.
[389:59.85]We've got... Now, I knew that was bullshit for the first thing that somebody said.
[390:19.33]But the real embarrassing thing is, like, the water thing.
[390:22.55]I... I have no response to any of that shit.
[390:26.79]I knew I knew I shouldn't have said, like, a brand name.
[390:36.32]Oh, I'm gonna have a big tall glass of that water.
[390:42.95]He's a piss drinker.
[390:47.92]Thank you though, smelly boy.
[390:49.54]Thank you for the tidbit there.
[391:16.58]I love how your name is JermaLiedAboutTacoBell, yet you reference the lie of me getting somebody fired from Taco Bell.
[391:27.67]Seems a little odd.
[391:32.84]Was it a lie or was it... I don't know.
[391:35.06]I got two different sides there.
[391:44.45]Thank you, Frodeon Weapon for the 250.
[391:45.94]Nothing to say, just happy Tuesday.
[391:47.17]Happy Tuesday to you as well, Frodeon Weapon.
[391:48.71]Thank you.
[391:52.52]Thank you, BigRen, for the three dollars.
[391:55.20]Jerma, your streams have been consistently my favorite things to watch and brighten my day.
[391:59.08]I lost my best friend last year to suicide, and the bright atmosphere you bring to every stream has always helped me smile.
[392:05.58]Thanks so much for helping me laugh and seeing the humor in things.
[392:08.93]Shout out to chat, too.
[392:10.37]Much love to everyone, jermaHeart.
[392:12.43]I drew a screenshot of you from the first stream in Vegas.
[392:16.45]Hope it's alright.
[392:19.31]First informers, I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[392:22.68]That's terrible.
[392:27.52]That rips my heart in half to hear that.
[392:36.75]But I really am happy that you mentioned chat here.
[392:40.82]Because, you know, people say, oh, like, I love your streams, I love your streams.
[392:46.36]They thank you for the streams.
[392:48.46]There's so many people here that are fucking awesome people.
[392:51.70]That are really funny, that are really interesting.
[392:54.34]That make these streams what they are, I think.
[392:57.22]So.
[393:01.99]Let me see the art, too.
[393:06.13]This is great.
[393:13.91]Comedy geniuses attract.
[393:16.85]Yeah, we're all just a bunch of geniuses.
[393:19.05]Come on.
[393:21.19]You watch this stream because you're a genius.
[393:33.05]Let's put this artwork on here so you can see.
[393:35.00]Did I say anything about here?
[393:49.84]This is from the landing of the balloon.
[393:51.20]Look at that sun.
[394:02.12]Look at that sun in the background.
[394:09.25]That's awesome.
[394:10.05]Thank you so much for this.
[394:17.45]And I'm...
[394:19.51]I'm glad that there's a community here and this stream here is something that can brighten your day.
[394:25.75]Especially considering something so terrible like that.
[394:29.29]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[394:33.32]But thank you so much for the $3.
[394:34.14]Thank you for the artwork.

[394:59.62]Thank you to Mac Dazzles for the $10.
[395:03.55]Hey Jerma, just recently got back into watching Twitch streams a few months ago and I'm glad to see you're still streaming.
[395:08.35]I used to watch your stuff back in 2016.
[395:09.79]You've been the highlight of my week and keep me company while I work, so I drew some pictures of you.
[395:16.90]I remember when you had that weird wrestling sound as your sub noise, if that serves my memory correct.
[395:23.14]Thanks for all the fun times, you're the most unique streamer.
[395:29.66]These are great.
[395:33.50]It's a little album here.
[395:40.43]Well, welcome back.
[395:43.17]Thank you for the $10.
[395:43.61]Here's this Imgur album here.
[395:53.38]Destroy... Yeah, that was a while ago.
[395:54.94]That was, like, at least, like, two or three years ago, yeah?
[395:58.00]That subsound was, like, 25 seconds long.
[396:07.89]Imagine if I had like a 30 second sub sound Still they wouldn't even be a live stream It would be that like a hundred times Weird flex
[396:35.15]No, that's not supposed to be a flex.
[396:36.82]That's supposed to be like a, I don't want the streams to be bad.
[396:40.08]I want to show this one.
[396:47.80]I like this one here.
[396:50.77]This is one of them from the album.
[396:54.51]It was Bask in its Glory.

[397:36.35]Some of you get that one.
[397:37.43]Some of you get it.
[397:38.87]I don't have to even explain that.

[399:28.60]Thanks for the 250.
[399:29.10]Hey, got a job too.
[399:31.30]Here's to you and chat.
[399:32.70]Reminder, I'm coming to Vegas around October for my birthday.
[399:36.98]And the best present ever would be to meet you and have JexCon in the MGM Grand.
[399:41.29]Just a reminder, no need to act on it.
[399:42.97]Love your streams and how wholesome and sweet you are.
[399:49.81]JexCon.
[399:54.49]I wondered, like, how many people would actually be interested in something like that.
[400:00.19]Jerma lied about Jexcon.
[400:06.91]I didn't lie about Jexcon.
[400:09.50]I was saying... Am I never allowed just to, like, come up with an idea on stream?
[400:16.30]You know what I mean?
[400:16.94]Like, is it a lie or is it like a, hey, do you think this would be fun?
[400:21.44]I want to, like, do something like this.
[400:22.68]It might be fun.
[400:24.74]That's not a lie.
[400:25.66]That's like coming up with a... It's like something fun.
[400:31.80]I can't wait for the Jerma lied about Jexcon.
[400:34.36]Jerma lied about like Level Up Lounge.
[400:37.96]Jerma lied about... There's gonna be like four more of them.
[400:40.21]We add like... There's gonna be more people that are in this chat in like another couple years that have those names.
[400:49.53]There's gonna be... It's gonna be full of Jerma lied about X.
[400:55.56]There's gonna be half of you guys.
[401:03.42]Yeah, maybe stop lying.
[401:05.26]If you don't play Ace Attorney... I already talked about Ace Attorney.
[401:24.40]Dermal lies at the bottom of the ocean.
[401:26.30]Holy shit.
[401:28.82]Are you trying to fucking... Oh my god.
[401:37.52]Thank you for the 250 though, Air Paradox.
